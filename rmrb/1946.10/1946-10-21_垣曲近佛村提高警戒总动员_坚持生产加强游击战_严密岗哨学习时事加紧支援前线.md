　　Yuanqu Jinfo Village Mobilizes to Raise Alertness
    Persist in Production, Strengthen Guerrilla Warfare
    Tighten Sentry Posts, Study Current Events, and Intensify Support for the Front Lines
    [Report from this newspaper, Yuanqu] Since the Chiang army occupied Yuanqu, they have been eager to commit further offenses. Jinfo Village in this county has completed all war preparations, waiting to strike at the invaders. The village first strengthened its village command headquarters, implemented a thorough emptying of houses and clearing of the fields, ensuring that men carry a shoulder pole's load and women a basket, so they can evacuate immediately upon discovering any situation. All thirteen labor mutual aid groups in the village have been converted into front-line support groups, with one part regularly participating in guerrilla activities and the other part serving as guards. School children are also organized to undertake tasks such as checking household registration, standing guard, providing communication and liaison, and preventing spies and secret agents. Transportation teams and stretcher teams to support the front lines have also been organized, ready to rush to the battlefield at any time. The women's team has ground more than 5,000 jin of flour in eight days to send to the front lines. Every night, village cadres disperse to various neighborhoods to check household registrations, publicize current events, report victory news, and encourage the morale of the masses. The village persists in production while preparing for war, combining with the masses transferred from other villages, absorbing their labor and livestock, and accelerating the completion of the autumn harvest, autumn planting, and fertilizer collection. The masses are tense but calm, full of confidence, saying, "If Chiang Kai-shek dares to oppress us, we'll guarantee he'll end up with nothing to show for it!" (Yu San, Luan Yu)
