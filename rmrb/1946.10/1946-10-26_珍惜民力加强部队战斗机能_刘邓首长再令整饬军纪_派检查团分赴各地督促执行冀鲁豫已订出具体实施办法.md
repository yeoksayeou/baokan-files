Xinhua News Agency, Jinji-Luyu General Branch, 25th: In order to cherish the strength of the people, strengthen the fighting ability of the troops, and strive for a complete victory in the sustained and comprehensive resistance, Military Region Commanders Liu and Deng issued another order on the 3rd of this month, ordering the troops to rectify mass discipline, tighten up rear-area organizations, and clear up supplies, and sent inspection teams to various places to supervise the implementation. Rang Mingde, Minister of the People's Movement Department of the Political Department of the Jinji-Luyu Military Region, conveyed the orders of Liu and Deng at the Hebei-Shandong-Henan cadre conference, and especially emphasized: "Those who violate mass discipline are not cooks, soldiers, or odd-job personnel. It is certain that they are cadres. That is to say, cadres are primarily responsible for violating mass discipline." "Those who violate discipline are, on the surface, violating revolutionary policies, but in reality, they are helping Chiang Kai-shek." Minister Rang called on all cadres to recognize the importance of rectifying discipline and earnestly implement the following regulations: 1. Tighten up organizations; all organizations below the regiment level should be abolished, and only five people are allowed to remain in the rear of the brigade and military sub-district. The rest (regardless of any cadre) must participate in front-line work. Weak female comrades and children should be dispersed and placed in an organized manner; 2. Clear up materials; in addition to those allocated to each organization, the remaining materials should be registered uniformly and sent to the military region's discipline inspection team for processing; 3. Support the government and cherish the people; except for military fire, weapons, and seriously wounded and sick soldiers, no large carts are allowed. All personnel passing through must hold a pass. For grain and grass, grain and fodder tickets must be submitted in accordance with the supply system. Red and white slips are not allowed, and no extra items (such as eating white flour instead of millet) are allowed, and it is even more forbidden to beat or scold local cadres and the masses. If there are any violations, local governments at all levels have the power to arrest and send them to the headquarters for processing. And earnestly implement the system of returning borrowed items (even a needle and thread) and compensating the masses for damaged items at local market prices; In addition, those who sacrifice or are injured due to war service by the masses should be treated in accordance with the treatment of military personnel. In order to earnestly implement Liu and Deng's orders to rectify discipline, Gan Weihan, Director of the Political Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Region, issued a call to all cadres: "Everything must be subordinate to the war. Only when the war is won can we have everything." "In a war environment, we must especially emphasize concentration. Everyone must play their role. After tightening up the organizations, comrades who do not have suitable work should go to the counties and districts to lead local armed forces to fight guerrillas, expand the guerrilla teams to regiments and brigades, and fully develop their talents in the war for the Party and the people." The rear political department has also formulated specific implementation measures, stipulating that all departments, except for application documents and fixed rations carried by livestock, should store all the surplus items, and each person should be issued a rice bag, and all personnel should be organized according to squads and platoons. Many cadres have been transferred to front-line work, and weak women and children have been settled. If there is action, we will not trouble a single common person.

　　珍惜民力加强部队战斗机能
    刘邓首长再令整饬军纪
    派检查团分赴各地督促执行冀鲁豫已订出具体实施办法
    【新华社晋冀鲁豫总分社二十五日电】为珍惜民力、加强部队战斗机能，争取持久的全面抵抗的完全胜利，军区刘、邓首长于本月三日再令部队整饬群众纪律，紧缩后方机关，清理资材，并派检查团分赴各地督促执行。晋冀鲁豫军区政治部民运部穰明德部长，在冀鲁豫干部大会上传达刘邓命令，特别强调指出：“违犯群众纪律者，不是炊事员、战士、杂务人员，肯定的说，是干部。也就是说干部是违犯群众纪律的主要负责者”。“犯纪律的人，表面上是违犯了革命政策，实际是帮助了蒋介石。”穰部长号召全体干部认识整饬纪律的重要，切实执行如下几项规定：一、紧缩机关，团以下机关一律取消，旅及分区后方只准留五个人，其余（不管任何干部）一律参加前方工作，身体虐弱的女同志及儿童，有组织的分散安插；二、清理物资，除各机关编制者外，所余物资统一登记，送军区整纪检查团处理；三、拥政爱民，除军火武器，重伤病员外，一律不准要大车，过往人员均须持通行证，要粮要草必须按供给制度交粮票料票，不准开红白条，不准要额外的东西（如不吃小米吃白面），更不准打骂地方干部和群众，倘有违犯者，各级地方政权有逮捕送指挥部处理之权。并切实执行借物还物（哪怕是一针一线），损物按当地市价赔偿群众的制度；此外，凡群众因战争勤务牺牲或负伤者，依部队人员处置。为切实执行刘、邓整饬纪律命令，冀鲁豫军区政治部甘渭汉主任，特向全体干部发出号召：“要一切服从战争，只有战争胜利了才有自己的一切。”“在战争环境中要特别强调集中，一个人要起一个人的作用。紧缩机关后，没有适当工作的同志，到县区去领导地方武装打游击，把游击队扩大到团到旅，为党为人民在战争中充分发挥自己的才能吧。”后方政治部并订出具体执行的办法，规定各部门除应用文件及定量行装由牲口驮外，多余东西全部存放起来，每人发米袋一条，所有人员均按班排编制。不少干部已调至前方工作，身体虐弱的妇女儿童均已安插就绪。若有行动，便一个老百姓都不要麻烦了。
