Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: "Chiang Kai-shek is honey-mouthed and dagger-hearted, good at disguising himself, and skillful in deception." This is the comment of Gao Chongming, the person in charge of the Northeast Branch of the Democratic League and current Vice Chairman of the Northeast Political Committee, on the peace atmosphere recently spread by Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Gao said: Chiang's ability was learned at the stock exchange when he was a gangster in Shanghai. Mr. Gao pointed out that Chiang violated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to workers and peasants, surrendered the Northeast for fourteen years without resistance, and violated the Double Tenth Agreement, the ceasefire order, and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference. He emphasized: In the past, the people suffered a lot from Chiang Kai-shek, and they will never be fooled again in the future. Today, the people of the whole country have seen through the double act played by the US and Chiang Kai-shek, and the movement demanding the withdrawal of US troops from China and the restoration of the ceasefire order and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference has been vigorously launched. If this movement's goal is not achieved, peace is out of the question. The "peace" in Chiang Kai-shek's mouth is nothing more than a smokescreen for launching an even more vicious offensive.
Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 24th: Shanghai News: Public opinion here is rising to expose Chiang Kai-shek's "peace offensive." On the 14th, the editorial of the Wenhui Daily pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's "peace offensive" was merely to cooperate with military requirements, using a short-term truce to adjust arrangements, replenish losses, and prepare for a new military offensive. The newspaper's editorial on the 15th further pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "political solution" is fundamentally problematic. On the one hand, he clamors about "defeating the main force of the Communist Party in three months" and "completely eliminating the armed forces of the Communist Party in five months," determined to adopt a military solution; on the other hand, he disregards the violation of the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference and issued the "National Assembly Convocation Order." This practice is a great contempt and insult to the parties participating in the Political Consultative Conference. On the 17th, the United Evening News published a conversation with an authoritative observer who said: Chiang Kai-shek's "eight conditions" lack the spirit of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and only "explain what the government wants from what it has won, what the government wants the Communist Party to agree to." The observer added: "Chiang Kai-shek's conditions seem to be an ultimatum, and the occupation of Zhangjiakou and the announcement of the National Assembly Convocation Order show the death of peace negotiations. Today's eight conditions can be said to be the entombment of peace."

　　蒋介石放出和平烟幕仅在掩饰其内战罪行
    各方舆论纷起揭露
    【新华社东北二十四日电】“蒋介石口蜜腹剑，善于伪装，巧于欺骗”，这是民盟东北总支负责人、现任东北政委会副主席高崇明氏对蒋介石最近散布的和平空气所作的评语。高氏说：蒋的这种本领，是在上海当流氓时在交易所学会的。高氏指出蒋违背中山先生联俄联共扶助工农三大政策、不抵抗断送东北十四年、破坏双十协定停战令及政协决议后着重说：过去人民吃了老蒋不少的亏，今后决不再上当了。时至今日，全国人民已看穿了美蒋扮演的双簧剧，要求美军退出中国、要求恢复停战令及政协决议的运动已蓬勃开展。这一运动目的不达，和平则无从谈起。蒋介石口中的“和平”，不过是发动更狠毒进攻的烟幕而已。
    【新华社延安二十四日电】沪讯：此间舆论界纷起揭露蒋介石的“和平攻势”。十四日，文汇报社评指出蒋介石的“和平攻势”，不过为了配合军事上的要求，利用短期休战来调整布置、补充损失、准备新的军事攻势而已。该报十五日社评，复指出蒋介石的所谓“政治解决”，根本是有问题的，一方叫嚣着所谓“三个月击溃中共主力”、“五个月彻底消灭中共武装力量”，决心采取军事解决的方针；一面又不顾违反政协决议，发表“国大召集令”，这种作法对于参加政协的各党派，实在是一种极大的蔑视与侮辱。十七日，联合晚报载某权威观察家谈话称：蒋介石的“八项条件”，缺乏政协决议的精神，仅仅说明了政府要从打得来的东西，政府要中共答应让的东西”。该观察家复谓：“蒋介石的条件，似乎是哀的美敦书，占领张家口与国大召集令的发表，显示着和平谈判之死亡。今日之八项条件，可说是和平已入殓”。
