　　[This Newspaper Yangcheng, 5th Dispatch] After the joint invasion of Quwo by the Chiang-Yan troops, everywhere they went became a "no-man's land." Our democratic government has specially established refugee reception stations, systematically transferring the masses safely to the rear. In addition to those transferred to the south of the road, 428 refugees from Quwo County have been transferred to the rear. In addition to providing loans of grain and houses to help them settle down, the democratic government has also provided a loan of 500,000 yuan from the county bank to establish a production and consumption cooperative to solve long-term living problems, and established refugee children's schools to help school-age children enroll in school. The young and middle-aged people transferred to the rear have now formed the Tiaodong Brigade to continue to use arms to cover the safe transfer of the masses.
