　　The militia on the Tongpu front heroically annihilates the enemy
    Seizes large quantities of American weapons
    Militia in the Third District of Linfen Launches "Back American Guns" Competition
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 6th dispatch] The militia in the Third District of Linfen launched a "Back American Guns" competition. During this Linfen-Fushan battle, they seized one American anti-tank gun, one heavy machine gun, five light machine guns, four "Sten" submachine guns, more than fifty rifles, one telescope and one reflector, and also captured more than seventy prisoners. The militia of the Third District, each carrying American weapons, backpacks of American felt, American steel lunch boxes, American-style rubber shoes, and holding "foreign umbrellas," cheerfully continued to cooperate with the main forces on the Linfen-Fushan highway. Wherever they went, the people said with beaming faces: "Our 'American-equipped militia' is here!"
    [This newspaper, Yangcheng, 6th dispatch] The militia on the Tongpu front is as close as flesh and blood to the main forces. In the Linfen-Fushan self-defense counter-offensive battle last month, the militia from more than a hundred villages and towns in Linfen, Fushan, and Hongtong counties rushed to the front to cooperate with the main forces. During the battle of Guanque on the 23rd of last month, the commanders of the Eighth Route Army greatly benefited from the help of the militia. Under the suggestion and guidance of the militia, they bypassed and attacked the Chiang army from a most hidden path on the edge of the village. After the battle began, the militia, braving the rain of bullets, led the main forces through alleys and courtyards to pursue and annihilate Chiang Kai-shek's elite First Brigade. When one of our units chased a group of Chiang's troops to the northern gully of Guanque Village, the militia heroes also chased down, and alone captured more than 30 Chiang soldiers, three "Sten" submachine guns, one anti-tank gun, one grenade launcher, more than 20 rifles, and one telescope. Another militia company, while cooperating with the main forces in combat, also took in 800 prisoners. The 47th Brigade, a regiment of Chiang's troops coming from Nanpanqiao to reinforce Guanque, was also repelled by the militia patrolling near Beihan Village on the Linfen-Fushan highway.

    【本报阳城六日电】同蒲前线民兵与主力部队亲如骨肉兄弟。上月下旬临浮自卫反击战役中，临（汾）浮（山）洪（洞）三县百余村镇民兵，争赴前线配合主力作战。上月二十三日官雀歼灭战时，八路军的指挥员们，得力于民兵的帮助很大，他们在民兵的提议与引导下，从村边一条最隐蔽的小路迂回进袭蒋军。战斗开始后，民兵冒着枪林弹雨，引着主力部队从一条巷、一个院里通过，去追歼蒋介石的精锐第一旅。当我某部把一股蒋军追到官雀村北山沟时，民兵英雄们也随着追下去，单独俘获蒋军三十余人、“斯登”手提式三挺、战防炮一门、掷弹筒一个、步枪二十余枝、望远镜一副。另一民兵连一面配合主力作战，一面收容俘虏达八百名。自南判桥来增援官雀蒋军之四十七旅一个团，亦为巡逻在临浮公路北韩村附近民兵击退。
