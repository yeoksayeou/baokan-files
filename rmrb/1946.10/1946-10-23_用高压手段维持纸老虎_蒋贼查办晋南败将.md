　　Using High-Pressure Tactics to Maintain a Paper Tiger
    Chiang Bandit Investigates Defeated Generals in Southern Shanxi
    [This Newspaper, Yangcheng, 21st Dispatch] According to reliable sources: Chiang Kai-shek has been investigating a large number of KMT generals who failed in the civil war in southern Shanxi. Liu Zhaoming, the brigade commander of the 31st Brigade (formerly a division) of the Chiang army, who was defeated at Yanzhang, Xia County, in July, has been dismissed from his post and sent to Nanjing for legal proceedings. Li Guopei, the commander of the 91st Regiment of the brigade, was sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, and Liu Quchun, the commander of the 92nd Regiment, was also sentenced to ten years of imprisonment.
    [Another News Item:] Liu Quchun has been shot. Dong Zhao, the commander of the First Army (formerly commander-in-chief of the 38th Army Group) after the Linfen Campaign, has also been severely reprimanded and punished. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to stimulate the already declining morale with reprimands, dismissals, imprisonment, and executions is obviously futile.

　　用高压手段维持纸老虎
    蒋贼查办晋南败将
    【本报阳城二十一日电】据确悉：蒋介石大批查办晋南内战失败将领，七月夏县堰掌败北之蒋军三十一旅（师改称）旅长刘钊铭已被撤职，解往南京法办。该旅九一团团长李国培判处徒刑十年，九二团团长柳屈春亦判处徒刑十年。
    【另息：】柳屈春已被枪杀。临浮战役后第一军军长董钊（原三八集团军总司令）亦受严厉申斥处分。蒋介石企图以申斥、撤职、徒刑、枪杀来刺激已经衰败的士气，显然是不能挽救的。
