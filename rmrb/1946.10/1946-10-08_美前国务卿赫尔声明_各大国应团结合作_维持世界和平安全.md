Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 3rd: According to the US News Agency in Washington: Former US Secretary of State Hull, currently ill, issued a statement on the eve of his 75th birthday, strongly urging all countries of the United Nations to unite and cooperate to maintain world peace. Hull first stated: America's greatest responsibility is to lead the world to achieve international unity and cooperation in order to serve peace, justice, freedom, and progress. This is the responsibility of every peace-loving country, especially the major powers. He pointed out that the current differences of opinion among countries, if not curbed, are very dangerous. He deeply feels that all countries must wholeheartedly base their relations on the same supreme interests of all countries, namely ensuring the security of a peaceful world and cultivating the social and economic welfare of the people. Hull strongly stated: The actions of all countries must be based on the following principles, namely, these major common interests cannot be achieved without practicing justice, fairness, and mutual respect. Hull concluded by emphasizing: "Only when every country unites with each other and supports its policies to promote common interests, only when countries continue to cooperate and support this interest with each other, can we achieve lasting peace. Only in this way can we have a world order under the rule of just law, free from the control of terror and brutality. Cooperation between the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and France is particularly important today."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th: According to various reports: US Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a speech at the American Overseas Association in Paris on the 3rd, reiterating that the US foreign policy remains unchanged. He expressed agreement with Stalin's statement that he "does not believe in the actual danger of a new war." One of the points in his speech that was noted by foreign diplomats in Paris was the reaffirmation of his foreign policy in cooperation with Vandenberg. He rejected Wallace's claim that there is "no need to interfere in Balkan affairs." United Press reporters believe that Byrnes' statement is a "reaffirmation of his tough policy towards the Soviet Union."
