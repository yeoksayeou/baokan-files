　　Improve Tools, Produce More Weapons, Kill Chiang Kai-shek!
    Changzhi Bomb Factory's Efficiency Doubles
    [This newspaper Changzhi Fourteenth Telegram] As the fierce battles in northern Henan rage on, workers in all sections of the Changzhi ×× Bomb Factory are doubling their efforts to improve production tools, increase work efficiency, and produce more bombs to support the front lines. Worker Wang Qingxian, after painstaking research, improved the tools, increasing production efficiency by 180%. In the fuse production, previously three people could barely supply one person; workers Chen Youjiang and Chen Quanwen transformed the tools so that two people can supply one person with plenty to spare. Workers Zhang Xingwang, Niu Qiwang, and others are intensifying their research on wood-turning tools, preparing to change from manual turning to machine turning. Li Yinzhi and Li Huirong of the sand casting department have developed a method of melting iron mixed with stones, which is both fast and clean. The melting time has been reduced from eight hours to three hours. The factory has already successfully completed five months of production tasks in three months.
