　　Demand a Genuine Ceasefire Order
    Restore Positions of January 13th
    Qiao Mu
    Today, China has only one possible genuine ceasefire order: to restore the positions of January 13th. We demand this genuine ceasefire order.
    Maintaining the positions of January 13th has always been the only recognized preparation for a ceasefire by the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States. Not to mention the ceasefire order itself on January 10th, Order He Zi No. 2 of the Military Mediation Department on January 20th stipulated: "Commanders should take all steps to restore the situation as of 12:00 midnight on January 13th." Order He Zi No. 6 on March 22nd stipulated: "In order to completely cease conflicts, government and Communist troops must be stationed at the positions they held at 12:00 noon on January 13th, 1946. Any troops that have crossed the above positions should immediately withdraw. All commanders should strictly implement this order to ensure that the positions at 12:00 noon on January 13th, 1946 are the responsibility of each executive group, and should continue to work hard. Any commander who fails to comply with the order to withdraw to the position at 12:00 noon on January 13th, 1946, or a mutually agreed-upon corrected position, will be guilty of violating the ceasefire order." Even in the negotiations in June of this year, the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States still agreed that "the Military Mediation Department should immediately determine all locations in mainland China occupied by government or Communist troops since January 13th, 1946. Within 20 days after the signing of this agreement, all relevant troops should be ordered to withdraw from these locations, unless otherwise instructed." Although the US and the Kuomintang verbally stated this each time, in reality, the Kuomintang constantly committed the crime of violating the ceasefire order. And the US, in 99 percent of the cases, tolerated and shielded them, so this crime was hardly ever prosecuted. But now, someone is even overturning this verdict legally, even promoting it as a "new concession" from the violators. This is truly a strange thing in China! Does committing a crime once mean committing a crime, committing a crime ten times mean not committing a crime, and committing a crime a hundred times mean making a concession? Confucius, who Chiang Kai-shek "worships," said it well: "Death has existed since ancient times, but a people cannot stand without trust." If such fundamental issues are not fundamentally determined, any negotiation or agreement is a joke, a deception.
    In fact, Chiang Kai-shek himself cannot find any reason to refuse to restore the positions of January 13th. His spokespersons only shyly say that this is a factual matter. They have come up with a brilliant plan: to announce another "ceasefire order" under the so-called eight conditions, but without restoring the positions of January 13th, and "temporarily stationed in the current location." This plan is brilliant, but unfortunately, it is too late. When Chiang Kai-shek has already fought several months of civil war and is now continuing to fight even more fiercely, people will no longer believe that he is doing it for peace. After the ceasefire order was torn up by Chiang Kai-shek, the Communist Party has repeatedly asked him to cease fire, even if he only gave a guarantee of a ceasefire, even if he only did not attack Zhangjiakou, but he was coldly rejected. Now that he has seized such important places in the liberated areas, he says that's how it is. A robber who claims to be a servant, after robbing most of the master's property, says in order to prevent the master from recovering it: "You implement my eight conditions, and we'll have a ceasefire!" The master says: "I have always wanted a ceasefire, now please return my things!" The robber says: "This is a factual issue. You should know that my proposing eight conditions is still my concession!" Can we recognize this robber's so-called "concession"? If Japan had attacked Guizhou, and then said: Let's have an eight-point ceasefire! May I ask if China could have recognized it at that time? Moreover, if a ceasefire is made in January, after nine months, a factual issue can be created and a so-called "temporary stationing in the current location" can be established. Then, after another nine months, wouldn't another factual issue lead to complete annihilation? The robber says: "Master! You are wrong to compare me to Japan. We are one family. What's mine is mine, and what's yours is also mine. I should completely eliminate you. But this is called eliminating warlord separatism. It is not a gain for me, and it is not a loss for you. Moreover, I will definitely treat you like foreign parents in the future. This is entirely for your own good, and I am planning it carefully for you?" But the land of China ultimately belongs to the people! Chiang Kai-shek, this self-proclaimed servant, occupies everything of the master and gives it to foreign countries, and desperately seizes the little property that the master risked his life to recover from foreign invaders. The degree of his ferocity is no different from that of Japan. He also says: Don't argue, when I finish robbing, I will naturally return everything. Can we believe this robber's logic?
    Some well-meaning people say, there is no need to hurt harmony too much. Now it is "when a scholar meets a soldier, reason is useless." You might as well look at the facts and bear this grievance for now! But you don't know that restoring the positions of January 13th is precisely looking at the facts. If there really was reason to be spoken, the war criminals should have been sent to court to be convicted of violating the ceasefire order. It is precisely because we are looking at the facts that we only demand the restoration of the positions of January 13th, and we must demand it. First, the ceasefire order of January 10th is the first, most basic, and most important of a series of agreements produced in China this year. Without the ceasefire order, there would be no Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and nothing else. Now everything else has been destroyed, and this last line of defense has also been destroyed long ago, but if we want to restore the position of peace, we must first restore this last line of defense. Second, the ceasefire order of January 10th not only binds the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but also binds the so-called mediating United States. This is the only legal basis for the joint activities of the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States. If we still hope that the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, and the United States can jointly abide by some kind of credibility in the future, then we can only restore the full dignity of this order. Third, the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas, who have fought eight years of patriotic bloody battles, have suffered such deep, cruel, and unbearable harm from Chiang Kai-shek. Their anger and hatred cannot be imagined even a fraction in the living rooms of Nanjing. Even if the Communist Party dares to sell out their interests, dares to allow Chiang Kai-shek to continue and legally trample on their lives, property, freedom, and rights, their actions will not be restrained by the Communist Party. Fourth, and most importantly, only restoring the positions of January 13th can prevent the continued occurrence of civil war in fact and in spirit, because this can enable the one million or more civil war troops that Chiang Kai-shek illegally mobilized after January 13th to return from North China, Northeast China, and Central China to the South; it can make the tense front lines where artillery fire is densely connected everywhere today relaxed and eased; it can force the warmongers who fanatically incite civil war and actively implement civil war to believe in the uselessness of war and begin to cool their heads with the cold water of peace. On the contrary, to humbly acknowledge Chiang Kai-shek's occupation is not a new ceasefire order, but a commendation order for the past civil war, and a mobilization order for the future civil war. May I ask every person who looks at the facts, is this not the most obvious fact today? You should know that when Chiang's large army was relatively far away on January 13th, when the Political Consultative Conference resolutions could still be passed, when the US government, Marshall, and the executive department still looked somewhat decent, and when US military aid was still beginning, the ceasefire order was still gradually destroyed. Then, under the circumstances that Chiang Kai-shek's large army has already entered the liberated areas, searched houses, killed people until their eyes are red, when the Political Consultative Conference resolutions are all torn up, everywhere is grabbing food, arresting people, and killing people, when the country is filled with gunpowder and fascist terror far greater than before, and when Marshall and the US personnel of the executive department of the US government openly favor Chiang Kai-shek, and US military aid has made Chiang Kai-shek plump, if Chiang's army does not withdraw to the positions of January 13th, who can guarantee that Chiang Kai-shek is willing to make peace? Who dares to boast about this? Who has such great power and supernatural power? If Chiang Kai-shek's spokesperson pats his chest in public today and says: I have it! I have it! Then this only means that he is a honey-tongued and sword-hearted liar. His intention is only to allow Chiang Kai-shek to legally consolidate his occupation without any effort, in order to further realize his 20-year-old fantasy of completely eliminating the Chinese democratic movement.
    But the Chinese people, who have been deceived too much, will never be deceived again. The era of winning by relying on sweet talk has passed. The issue is very simple, why don't the people welcome true peace? How can the people accept false peace? The people today only demand one kind of ceasefire order, that is, a ceasefire order that restores the positions of January 13th. This is the only touchstone of true peace, and anything else is a bloody and vicious deception.

　　要求真正的停战令
    恢复一月十三日位置
    乔木
    今天中国只有一个可能的真正停战令，就是恢复一月十三日位置。我们要求这种真正的停战令。
    保持一月十三日位置，从来是国共美三方公认的唯一停战准备，一月十日的停战令本身不必说，一月二十日军调部和字第二号命令规定：“指挥官应采取各种步骤恢复一月十三日晚十二时之情况。”三月二十二日和字第六号命令规定：“为彻底停止冲突起见，政府及中共军队必须停驻于三十五年一月十三日下午十二时所在之位置，任何部队曾越过上述位置者应立即退回。各指挥官应严格执行此命令，确保三十五年一月十三日下午十二时之位置乃各执行小组之责任，并应继续努力。任何指挥官如不遵令撤退至三十五年元月十三日下午十二时正之位置或双方同意之改正位置，以违犯停战命令论罪”。直至今年六月的谈判中，国共美三方仍然同意“军调部应立即确定一九四六年一月十三日起中国内地被政府军或中共军所占领之各地，在本协定签字后二十日内，除特另加指示者外，应令各有关部队撤出此等地方”。国美两方虽然每次口头这样说了，实际上国方却是不断犯违犯停战命令之罪。而美方在百分之九十九的情形下也都是予以容忍包庇，所以这个罪简直没有论过。但是现在忽然有人竟然连法律上也推翻这个定案，甚至宣传这是犯违者的一种“新让步”，这真是中国的大怪事！难道犯一次罪叫犯罪，犯十次罪将叫无罪犯，犯一百次反叫让步了吗？蒋介石所“崇拜”的孔子说得好：“自古皆有死，民无信不立。”这样的根本问题如不根本确定，任何谈判任何协议就都是玩笑、就都是欺骗了。
    事实上蒋介石自己也找不出任何理由来拒绝恢复一月十三日的位置，他的发言人只是羞羞答答的说这是事实问题，他们想出一条妙计，就是在所谓八项条件之下再一次宣布“停战令”，但是不恢复一月十三日的位置，而“暂驻现地”，这个计是妙，可惜太晚了。当蒋介石已经大打了几个月的内战，现在还是继续大打有加无已的时候，人们再不会相信他是为了什么和平了。在停战令已被蒋介石撕毁以后，中共曾无数次要求他停战，甚至只要他给一个停战的保证，甚至只要他不进攻张家口一处，但是都受到他的冷酷拒绝。现在他抢了解放区这么重要的地方，他却说就这样算了。自称为仆人的强盗，抢了主人的大部财产以后，为了不许主人追还就说：“你实行我八项条件，我们停战吧！”主人说：“我从来是要停战，现在请把东西还我！”强盗说：“这却是事实问题，须知我提出八项条件这还是我的让步呢！”我们能承认这种强盗的所谓“让步”吗？日本打到贵州，于是说：我们来个八条停战吧！试问这时中国能承认吗？而且一月停了战，过了九个月可以造成事实问题而来一个所谓“暂驻现地”，那么再过九个月再来个事实问题不就要全部消灭吗？强盗说：“主人！你把我比做日本，你错了，我们是一家，我的是我的，你的也是我的，我正是应该把你全部消灭。不过这叫做消灭武力割据，在我不为得，在你不为失，而且我以后对你一定象对外国的父母一样孝敬，这是完全为你好，我才为你打算得周到呢？”但是中国的土地究竟是人民的呀！蒋介石这个自称的仆人，霸占了主人的一切让送外国，而且把主人拚命从外国侵略者手中收回的一点家产都要穷凶极恶的抢光，其凶恶的程度与日本无异。他还说：不必争，等我抢完了自然通通奉还。我们能相信这种强盗的逻辑吗？
    有些好心的人说，不必太伤和气了，现在是“秀才遇见兵，有理说不清。”你姑且看事实说话，委屈这一回吧！殊不知恢复一月十三日位置正是看事实说话，如果当真有理可说，早该把战犯送到法庭去以违犯停战命令论罪了。正是因为看事实说话，我们才只要求恢复一月十三日位置，而且非如此要求不可。第一、一月十日的停战令是中国今年所产生的一连串协议当中的第一个，也是最基本最重要的一个。没有停战令，就没有政协决议，就没有其他一切。现在其他一切都破坏了，这道最后防线也早被破坏了，但是如果要恢复和平的阵地，就不能不首先恢复这道最后防线。第二、一月十日的停战令，不但约束着国共双方，而且约束着所谓调处的美国。这是国共美三方共同活动的唯一法律基础，如果还希望今后国共美三方能够共同遵守某一种信义，那么只有恢复这个命令的全部尊严。第三、经过八年爱国血战的解放区军民，受了蒋介石如此深重残暴不可忍受的侵害，他们的愤怒仇恨决非南京的客厅中所能想象于万一，即使中共敢于出卖他们的利益，敢于允许蒋介石继续并且合法蹂躏他们的生命财产自由权利，他们的行动亦决非中共所能约束。第四、最重要的一点就是只有恢复一月十三日的位置，才是从事实上和精神上阻止内战的继续发生，因为这可以使蒋介石在一月十三日以后违法调动的一百几十万内战大军，从华北、东北、华中回到南方；可以使今天到处密接的炮火连天的紧张战线，顿然松驰和缓下来；可以使狂热煽动内战和积极执行内战的好战分子，被迫相信战争的无益而开始用和平的凉水清一清自己的头脑。反之，卑躬屈节的承认蒋介石的侵占，这就不是什么新的停战令，而只是过去内战的嘉奖令，而只是将来内战的动员令。试问每一个看事实说话的人，这是不是今天的最明显的事实呢？须知在一月十三日蒋方大军比较远离的时候，在政协决议还能通过的时候，在美国政府马歇尔和执行部还多少象个样子的时候，在美国军事援助还在开始的时候，停战令尚且被逐渐破坏，那么在蒋介石大兵对解放区已经登堂入室翻箱倒柜杀人杀得眼都红了的情形下，在政协决议全部撕毁到处拉丁征粮捉人杀人、全国充满火药气和法西斯恐怖远甚从前的情形下，在美国政府马歇尔和执行部美方人员公然偏袒蒋介石、美国军事援助已使蒋介石羽毛丰满的情形下，蒋军如不撤回一月十三日位置，谁还能保证蒋介石愿意和平。谁敢夸这种海口？谁有这种天大的权力和神通？如果蒋介石的发言人在今天当众拍着胸膛说：我有！我有！那么这只是表示他是个口蜜腹剑的骗子，他的企图只是使蒋介石不费吹灰之力就合法的巩固他的占领，以便进一步实现他二十年来不能实现的彻底消灭中国民主运动的幻想。
    但是受骗太多的中国人民决不再受骗了。依靠花言巧语而取得胜利的时代已经过去了。问题十分简单，真和平人民为什么不欢迎呢？假和平人民怎么能接受呢？人民今天只要求一种停战令，这就是恢复一月十三日位置的停战令。这是真和平的唯一试金石，除此以外都是血腥和毒辣的骗局。
