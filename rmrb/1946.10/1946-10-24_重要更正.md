　　Important Correction
　　In the first sentence of the statement by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on page one of this newspaper on the 20th, "Our party, after the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, immediately cooperated with the Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek..." The word "from" was mistakenly written as "hope" before the word "from". We hereby make a correction and hope readers will pay attention.
