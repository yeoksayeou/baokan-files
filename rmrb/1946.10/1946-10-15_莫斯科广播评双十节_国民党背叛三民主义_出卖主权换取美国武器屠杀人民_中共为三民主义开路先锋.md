Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 11th: Moscow Radio today broadcast commentator Yevgeny's comments on the 35th anniversary of China's founding (i.e., October 10th), pointing out that the Kuomintang, in power for 35 years, has violated Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Sun Yat-sen's principle of nationalism advocated China's independence and sovereignty, but the Kuomintang reactionaries used China's sovereignty to exchange for American weapons to carry out civil war. The Kuomintang's upper-level elements' anti-democratic policies do not allow democrats to participate in managing the country, which contradicts the principle of democracy. The pro-fascist elements of the Kuomintang, with American aid, attempted to eliminate the liberated areas and democratic system established by the Chinese Communist Party. In terms of the principle of people's livelihood, the facts prove that the Kuomintang has no ability to overcome the economic crisis. Widespread famine has occurred in many provinces, and tens of millions of people have starved to death. Yevgeny concluded by saying that Chinese democrats are continuing to resolutely struggle for the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and the Chinese Communist Party is the pioneer. He supports the Chinese people's demands for sovereignty and resolutely calls for an end to the Chinese civil war, which has won the warm sympathy of international democrats and the strong support of the Chinese people.

　　莫斯科广播评双十节
    国民党背叛三民主义
    出卖主权换取美国武器屠杀人民
    中共为三民主义开路先锋
    【新华社延安十一日电】莫斯科今日广播：评论员耶夫根尼论中国建国卅五周年纪念（即十月十日）时指出：执政三十五年的国民党，违反了孙中山的三民主义，孙中山民族主义主张中国独立自主，而国民党反动派却用中国的主权去换取美国的武器来进行内战，国民党上层分子的反民主政策不允许民主人士参加管理国家，与民权主义相矛盾。国民党亲法西斯分子在美国援助下，企图消灭中共建立的解放区与民主制度。在民生主义方面，事实证明国民党没有能力克服经济危机，许多省份发生普遍饥荒，已饿死几千万人，耶夫根尼结语称：中国民主人士在继续坚决为实现三民主义而奋斗，中共为开路先锋，他拥护中国人民主权的要求及坚决号召停止中国内战，已获得国际民主人士的热烈同情与中国人民的强大援助。
