　　Our Army on the He-Ju Highway Front
    Continues to Annihilate Over a Hundred Remnants of Chiang's Troops
    [This newspaper's report from the front lines of Ji-Lu-Yu on the 21st] Following the annihilation of a regiment of Chiang's American-equipped 11th Division (formerly the 18th Army) in Zhangfengji, the Eighth Route Army on the He(ze)-Ju(ye) Highway front continued to encircle and annihilate the remnants in Xiaojiatang (west of Zhangfengji). Two thousand of these Chiang troops, carrying American equipment, fled south from Xiaojiatang towards Jiewenhuang. After a brave pursuit by a unit of the Eighth Route Army consisting of just over a hundred men, over a hundred Chiang soldiers were killed or wounded, and one warhorse, two American-made machine guns, and three rifles were captured. The Eighth Route Army suffered only six casualties.
