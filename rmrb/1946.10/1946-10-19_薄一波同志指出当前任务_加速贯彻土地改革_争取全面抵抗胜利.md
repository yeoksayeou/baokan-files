    [Special Dispatch from this Newspaper] In order to unify steps, strengthen the self-defense war, and implement land reform, the Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Yu Border Region invites responsible comrades from various agencies in the border region to the Office every Monday to broadly exchange opinions on the current situation, combat tasks, and various work issues, thereby formulating guidelines. Party, government, and military leaders all attend regularly, and this practice has been quite effective. During the third meeting, coinciding with the publication of the "Strive for Victory in the Overall Resistance" appeal in the Liberation Daily, an in-depth discussion was immediately launched. Comrade Bo Yibo, based on the basic spirit of the editorial and combined with the specific situation of the region, put forward many opinions, pointing out that we should unify our steps, strengthen unity, make long-term plans, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle from the eight-year War of Resistance, fight bravely, and accelerate land reform to strive for victory in the overall resistance. Various agencies in the border region have held cadre meetings for mobilization in recent days. At cadre meetings of the border region government, the Central Bureau of the CCP Jin-Ji-Ji-Yu, etc., everyone unanimously expressed that they will work even harder in the future, contribute to the patriotic war, and strive for greater victories. All cadres of this newspaper and the news agency held a mobilization meeting on the 13th and resolved to respond to the call for overall resistance with practical actions.
