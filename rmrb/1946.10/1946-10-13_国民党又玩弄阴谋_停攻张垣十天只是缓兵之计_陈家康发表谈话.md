　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Nanjing dispatch: Communist Party spokesman Chen Jiakang issued the following statement: (1) The Communist Party has stated that the government army's attack on Zhangjiakou is a sign of its determination for a complete split. Acknowledging a ten-day halt to the attack on Zhangjiakou is merely a delaying tactic, aimed at masking the government's temporary military predicament in order to reinforce troops and redeploy for a renewed offensive. This is by no means a genuine ceasefire, nor does it indicate a renunciation of its determination for a complete split. (2) The Communist Party believes that a ceasefire, meetings, and negotiations on all issues are the natural path to a political solution. However, halting the attack on Zhangjiakou for only ten days to discuss only the two demands put forward by Chiang Kai-shek on October 2 (namely, 13 seats on the National Government Committee, submission of the National Assembly member list, and specifying the deployment of 18 Communist Party divisions) is a method of forcing the Communist Party into surrender within a deadline. This is by no means an equal negotiation between both sides on all relevant issues. (3) The so-called government's agreement to a full ten-day ceasefire is even further from the truth.

　　国民党又玩弄阴谋
    停攻张垣十天只是缓兵之计
    陈家康发表谈话
    【新华社延安十日电】南京讯：中共发言人陈家康发表谈话如下：（一）中共曾提出政府军之进攻张家口是其决心全面破裂之表示，如果承认停攻张垣十天，那只是缓兵之计，作用在于掩护政府军事上一时之窘境，以便其增调军队重新布置进攻，决非真心停战，更非放弃全面破裂之决心，（二）中共认为休战开会谈判一切问题，是政治解决的当然途径，若只对张垣停攻十天只谈蒋介石十月二日所提两项要求（即国府委员十三名、交国大名单与规定中共十八个师驻地问题），这是限期逼迫中共作城下之盟的办法，决非双方平等的谈判一切有关问题；（三）所谓政府同意全面停战十天之说更非事实。
