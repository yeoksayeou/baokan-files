　　New Cotton Listed, Transactions Active
    Wu'an City Cotton Continuously Transported Westward
    Twenty-Three New Flower Shops Added
    [Our Newspaper] Wu'an's new cotton has been listed, and transactions are very active. On the 9th, over 30,000 jin of cleaned cotton were listed, with a total transaction value of over 1.7 million yuan. In order to facilitate cotton trading, the county government and the market management committee have added two new markets near the Xiaoxiguan corner building and the square outside Nanguan. Cotton prices are relatively stable: seed cotton is 60-70 yuan per jin, inferior cotton is 220-230 yuan, and ginned cotton is 270-280 yuan to 300 yuan. Most of Wu'an's cotton is sold to Zuoquan, Yushe, Wuxiang, and Xiangyuan in Shanxi. Seeing the cotton continuously transported westward, the citizens of Wu'an said with admiration and anticipation: "The Communist Party has settled the people there for eight or nine years, laying a good foundation. They are buying the cotton back to spend a good winter!"
    Another item: During the enemy and puppet rule in Wu'an, all private flower shops closed down. After the new cotton was listed this year, twenty-three new flower shops have been added (those set up on consignment are excluded). All eight cotton gins in the city are now in operation. Over 200 cotton gins are mostly in operation, and all will be in operation as soon as farming becomes less busy.

　　新棉上市成交活跃
    武安城棉花源源西运
    新增花店二十三家
    【本报讯】武安新棉上市，交易甚为活泼。九日上市净花三万余斤，成交总值一百七十余万元。县政府与市场管理委员会，为了便利棉花买卖，特于小西关拐角楼一带及南关外的广场上，增设两个新市场。花价相当平稳：籽花每斤六七十元，穰花二百二三十元，弹花二百七八十元到三百元。武安棉花大都销往山西左（权）榆（社）武（乡）襄（垣）一带。武安市民看到棉花源源西运，以羡慕和期待的口吻说：“共产党在那里给老百姓安置了八九年，有了底啦，把棉花买回去，好好的过冬吧！”
    另息：武安在敌伪统治时，私人花店全部倒闭。今年新花上市后，重新增花店二十三家（代设的在外），全城弹花机八架，已全部开工。轧花机二百余辆，已大部开工，待农事稍闲，即可全部开工。
