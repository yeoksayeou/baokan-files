　　Xing City Liberation Anniversary Week
    Niu Xin
    A few days ago, often late at night, one could still hear the sounds of gongs and drums practicing the Yangko dance, making one feel that the city's situation was truly different from a year ago. During the days when the enemy and puppets ruled this city, Mr. Wang, who had been the Dean of Studies at Xingtai Normal School, said to me over breakfast on the 24th: "Last year, I really didn't know what the Eighth Route Army was all about, and I was very afraid. An elderly neighbor told me to wear new clothes to welcome the Eighth Route Army. I went, and the militiamen suspected I must be a bad person." But now, even a trace of the shadow in his heart has long disappeared. He is now the principal of Xingtai Normal School and also a member of the Labor Support Committee for the anniversary of the liberation of Xingtai City.
    Indeed, when the army that truly belongs to the people has not yet erased the people's erroneous perceptions of the old enemy, puppet, or warlord armies, there will be some estrangement between the people's army and the people. On the afternoon of the 25th, Village Chief Li of Nantou Village, Fourth District, said at his doorstep: "The masses in the entire village have been emancipated, with land to cultivate and houses to live in. It's a pity that when we were first liberated, the masses didn't understand the Eighth Route Army and didn't launch a struggle, allowing several traitors and despots to escape. If it were now, many despots, traitors, and landlords would be overthrown. They will never come back." Yes, landlords, traitors, and despots will never come back because the people and the people's army are united, and no one can defeat them.
    In the early summer of 1944, on Minzu Road in Chongqing, I personally saw the citizens' donation procession coming. The boss of the Sichuan Salt Bank had his servants throw one-yuan bills of legal tender from the top floor of the Western-style building, letting the citizens all over the street bend down and pick them up one by one, as if they were kneeling to someone. Now, in Xingtai, things are happening that are completely different from the KMT-controlled areas: Dr. Wu Menglin and his wife competed to support the army, the man donating one thousand yuan, and the woman taking out five hundred yuan from her long-term savings; an old woman selling fried dough sticks also donated one thousand yuan; the blackboard on the street wrote that Tongxing Li of Huashi Street supported the army with 150,000 yuan,...
    Over the past week, we have spent a lot of time in various streets and alleys and some public places where the masses gather. I saw that the masses in West Gate Street were well-organized, and after each Yangko team performed there, they collectively discussed the content of the Yangko. I saw someone writing on the criticism book of the Xing City Agricultural School's agricultural exhibition: "Please exhibit in the countryside." I saw in the photo exhibition room in front of the city government, an old woman with a face full of wrinkles pointing to the picture of Chairman Mao and saying to her daughter-in-law: "Look, look at the face of our benefactor, Chairman Mao, he is a good man!" Another young man pointed to a large pile of American weapons captured in the Ping-Han Campaign and said: "Let Lao Jiang come, he's here to send us guns and cannons again!" Also, under the propaganda shed in the Naliang Garden, I heard a simple farmer ask a young propagandist: "Is America much worse than Japan?" In the local product exhibition room of the City Federation of Industry and Commerce, next to the thread-spinning machine newly invented by Guo Jingxing that can spin 22-count yarn, I heard a middle-aged woman explaining to the audience with excitement and joy: "I am a poor worker, very poor. He (Guo Jingxing) failed several times! If it weren't for the help of the democratic government, he wouldn't have had the money, and he wouldn't have been able to invent a thread-spinning machine in his lifetime. The government lent him 900,000 yuan as capital, and the district also said, 'Do it, if you lose money, I'll subsidize you,' and that's how he made this machine." Under the South Gate, two young women apparently met unexpectedly. I heard one of them say: "My mother-in-law doesn't beat me anymore. Since liberation, she hasn't dared to beat me, and she doesn't care if I go to the street!" Also, the "Shop Assistant's Suffering" performed by the shop employees' union of North Main Street, the "Blood and Tears of Hatred" adapted and performed by the China Grand Theater, and the "Great Fight in Hutong Gong" self-composed and sung by the story-telling team of the Handan Mass Art Research Association of the South Gate Shopping Mall, made me understand the great creative ability of the people. At the same time, I unintentionally learned the most valuable creative process of people's art one night. It was already very late, and I passed through a small alley near the Confucius Temple. There was a group of people speaking, singing, and laughing in the dark. At first, I didn't understand what they were doing. Later, I realized that they were collectively creating Yangko lyrics. One person composed and sang, while the others were the audience and critics. Whoever heard a sentence that was not suitable would offer opinions to revise it until everyone agreed, and then they would continue to compose and sing.
    Xingtai City has only been liberated for a year. Although it is only a year, the people's thinking is completely different from before. Let the reactionaries dream of reversing history in broad daylight. The people respect reality. The people know that the life before liberation cannot be compared with the present. Before liberation, the grain brought by the villagers had to be sold in the grain stores. Now, as long as it is placed on the roadside of the street, it can be bought and sold freely, without commission fees and no one interferes. Before liberation, poor people who gave birth to babies and could not afford to raise them would secretly abandon them. Now, for almost a year, the North Gate Orphanage has not picked up a single abandoned baby. Before liberation, no matter entering or leaving the city gate, or walking on the street, one would encounter misfortune at any time. Now, it is too free and too comfortable. If someone wants to bring the days before liberation back to the citizens, what will the citizens do? Vice Mayor Li said to more than 10,000 citizens at the celebration of liberation and support of the front line on the 30th: "The city's donations have reached 10 million yuan." This is the power of the people. This is a very good answer.

　　邢市解放周年一周间
    牛信
    几天前，往往在深夜，还能听见练习扭秧歌的锣鼓声响，使人体味着市民的光景，真和一年前大不相同。在敌伪统治着这座城市的日子里，曾经当过邢师教务主任的王先生，二十四日吃早饭时，对我说：“去年，真不知道八路军是干啥的，都怕得很，一个邻家的老人叫我穿新衣服去接八路军，我去了，被民兵怀疑我一定不是好人。”而现在呢，心头的阴影早连半丝儿也不存在了，他作了邢师的校长，还兼着庆祝邢台市解放一周年劳军委员会的委员。
    的确，在真正属于人民的军队，还没涂抹掉人民对旧日敌伪或军阀军队那种错误观念的时候，人民的军队和人民之间会存有一些隔阂的。二十五日下午，四区南头村李村长在他家门口就说过这样的话：“全村的群众都翻身了，有地种，有房住。可惜，刚解放的时候，群众不了解八路军，没展开斗争，叫几个汉奸恶霸逃跑了。要是现在，有多少恶霸、汉奸、地主，也会被斗掉的。他们是永远回不来了”。是的，地主、汉奸、恶霸是永远回不来了，因为人民和人民的军队结合在一起，谁也无法战胜。
    四四年的初夏，在重庆的民族路，我亲眼看见市民们的募捐行列过来了，川盐银行的老板叫仆役抱了一元的单张法币从洋楼的顶上层撒了下来，让满街的市民弯下腰，一张一张的拾起，好象在跪拜谁似的。现在，在邢台，正发生着和蒋管区完全两样的事情：医生吴梦林和他的老婆竞赛劳军，男人捐一千，女人拿出长期积蓄的五百元；一个卖油条的老太婆也捐了一千元；街头黑板写着花市街同兴李拥军十五万元，……
    一周来，我们很多时间用在各个大街小巷和一些群众汇聚的公共场所。我看到西关街的群众组织得好，每一个秧歌队在那里表演过了，他们便大伙集体讨论秧歌的内容。我看到有人在邢市农校农业展览的批评簿上写着：“请到农村中展览。”我看到市府门前的照片展览室里，有一个脸上满是皱纹的老太婆指着毛主席的像片对儿媳说：“看呀，看咱恩人毛主席的脸像，就是好人！”又有一个年青小伙子指着平汉战役缴获的一大堆美国武器说：“叫老蒋来吧，又来给咱送枪炮啦！”还有，在纳凉园的宣传棚下，我听见一个朴实的庄家汉问一个小宣传队员：“美国比日本坏的多狠？”在市商联会的土货展览室里，在郭镜兴新近发明成功能纺二十二支线的纺线机旁，我听见一个中年妇女向观众又兴奋又愉快的解释着：“俺是穷工人，可穷的很，他（郭镜兴）做了几次，都失败啦！要不是民主政府帮助，自己没钱，一辈子也发明不了纺线机。政府借给九十万作本钱，区上还说，做吧，赔了我贴补你，他才做好这一架机子。”在南城门底下，有两个年青的妇女显然是出于意外的相遇了，我听见其中的一个说：“俺婆子不打我了，从解放以后，她一直没敢打我，我来街上，她也不管啦！”还有，北大街店员工会编演的“店员难”，中国大戏园改编又演出的“血泪仇”，南关商场邯郸大众艺术研究会说书班自编自唱的“大斗胡同公”，使我懂得了人民创作能力的高强。同时，最值得宝贵的人民文艺的创作过程被我在一个夜晚无意中学到了。那时，夜已经很深了，我经过文庙附近的一条小巷，黑暗里有一堆人又说、又唱、又笑，起先不明白是干啥的，后来才知道是群众在集体创作秧歌小词，一个人一面编一面唱，其余的人是听众也是批评家，谁听着那一句不合适，提出意见来修改，直到大家都同意了，才继续的编下去，唱下去。
    邢台市解放才一年，虽然仅仅是一年呀，人民的思想和从前已完全不一样了。让反动派在白天做着扭转历史的梦吧，人民是很尊重现实的。人民知道解放前的生活不能和现在相比，在解放前，乡下人担来的粮食，非在粮行不能卖，现在，只要往大街的路边一放，随便买卖，不出佣钱，没人干涉；在解放前，穷人们生了婴孩，养活不起，便偷偷扔掉了，现在，足足有一年的样子，北关孤儿院没有拾过一个弃婴；在解放前，不管进出城门，不管街上行走，随时都会遭遇祸患，现在，太自由了，太自在了。假如，有人要把解放前的日子带还市民，市民将怎样办呢？李副市长三十日在庆祝解放支援前线大会对万余市民说的一句话：“全市的捐款已达一千万了。”这就是人民的力量。这就是很好的答复。
