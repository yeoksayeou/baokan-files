Xinhua News Agency, with General Liu Bocheng's Headquarters, 8th. General Liu Bocheng's headquarters is permeated with a tense but calm atmosphere. The motors of the transmitters are rumbling, wires crisscross the streets, and communication staff are busy. General Liu was giving instructions by telephone in front of a huge map. When the reporter showed him the Central News Agency's fabricated broadcast about General Liu's death, General Liu dismissed it with a smile and continued his telephone command; he is creating an astonishing victory. According to an authoritative source at General Liu's headquarters: The Central News Agency's shameless rumors are aimed at covering up their repeated defeats and attempting to boost their repeatedly exhausted morale and military spirit. Recently, they first said General Liu was wounded, then that he had fled, and then that he had died, which is contradictory and ridiculous. In three months, the troops of the genius commander General Liu Bocheng have annihilated ten brigades (divisions) of Chiang Kai-shek's army. Zhao Xitian, commander of the Third Division, was wounded and captured, and Huang Zhengcheng, commander of the First Brigade, was captured. Liu Mingzhao, commander of the 31st Division, and Mi Wenhe, commander of the 181st Division, barely escaped with their lives, disguised and fleeing in panic. Countless other senior officers have been killed. It is said that General Liu is now displaying his brilliant military command genius, and in the near future, Chiang Kai-shek's army will once again taste General Liu's power.

　　刘伯承将军正发挥指挥天才
    不久将有惊人战果
    中央社无耻造谣在于掩盖败绩
    【新华社随刘伯承将军总部记者八日电】刘伯承将军总部浸润在紧张而冷静的气氛中，发报机的马达隆隆作响，街上电线纵横，通讯备助忙录，刘将军在一幅巨大的地图前以电话指示机宜，记者以中央社捏造刘将军牺牲的广播稿出示，刘将军一笑置之，仍继续其电话指挥，他正在创造一惊人战果。据刘将军总部某权威人士称：中央社这种无耻造谣，在于掩盖其接二连三的败绩，并图以振奋其再三衰竭的士气军心。近日他们一说刘将军负伤，二说潜逃，三说牺牲，前后矛盾可笑。天才指挥者刘伯承将军的部队，在三个月中已歼灭将军十个旅（师），第三师师长赵锡田负伤被俘，第一旅旅长黄正成就擒，三十一师师长刘铭钊一八一师师长米文和仅以身免，微服落荒而逃，其他高级军官被击毙者更不计数。据称：刘将军现正发挥其高明的军事指挥天才，不久的将来，蒋介石军将再一次尝到刘将军的厉害。
