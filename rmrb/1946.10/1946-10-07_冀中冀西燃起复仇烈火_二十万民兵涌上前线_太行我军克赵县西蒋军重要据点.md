Xinhua News Agency, Ping-Han Front, 3rd: Our correspondent accompanying the army reports that 200,000 militiamen from central and western Hebei have surged to the Ping-Han front lines. The Ping-Han Railway, the jugular vein of Chiang's army's civil war, has been melted by the flames of revenge over the past few nights. On the evening of the 30th of last month, a reporter took a car to inspect the section between Xushui and Beihedian. In the 80-plus li stretch along the railway, the militiamen from Yi County, Mancheng, Dingxing, and other counties numbered more than 20,000. Amidst the urgent sounds of picks and shovels were bursts of explosions. When the reporter returned the next morning, the shape of the elevated railway foundation was no longer visible, and six iron bridges had been overturned into the riverbed, like dead snakes that had been cut apart. The opposite situation was present in the rear of the liberated areas. The ×× Bridge was quickly completed overnight under the leadership of County Chief Zhang and tens of thousands of militiamen, greatly facilitating transportation to the front lines. Going back and forth to the fourth district of Yi County, more than 400 stretchers were gathered, padded with wheat straw and cotton, soft and comfortable. An old man happily explained to the reporter: "These stretchers are for the comrades of the Eighth Route Army. The army is for the people, and the people are for the army. If it were Chiang Kai-shek, even giving him a thorn bush to sleep on would be a favor!" When the wounded passed through the towns and villages of various counties, they were either surrounded by women and children and taken inside to rest, or towels, eggs, and cakes were stuffed onto the stretchers. As autumn deepens and winter approaches, a grand movement to provide warmth to the troops by sewing cotton shoes, cotton socks, and cold-proof vests is underway in various places.

This Newspaper, Changzhi, 4th: Our army in the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway continues to expand the results of its self-defense counterattack. On the 2nd of this month, a certain unit of our army in Gaoyi captured the important stronghold of the Chiang army, Da Liuli Village, west of Zhao County, killing and capturing thirteen members of the puppet self-defense force and seizing thirteen rifles and four head of livestock. On the night of the 28th of last month, a certain unit of our army completely wiped out the Kuomintang secret service armed "Homecoming Corps" entrenched in Zhizitun Village, southwest of Yuanshi City, killing, wounding, and capturing thirty-eight officers and soldiers of the "Homecoming Corps," and seizing nine rifles and one telephone. Zhizitun Village was immediately recovered by our army.
