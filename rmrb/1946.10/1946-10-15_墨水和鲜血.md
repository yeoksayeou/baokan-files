　　Ink and Blood
    By Ehrenburg, translated by Wan Ge

    This is an article written by the famous Soviet journalist Ehrenburg after traveling in the United States for two months, published in Collier's magazine. Mr. Ehrenburg showed infinite pain at the slander carried out by American newspapers against the Soviet Union. He asked the American people to be careful and guard against paying their own precious blood for the cheap ink of journalists. The original translation was published in Wenhui Daily. (Editor)

    The United States of America is a huge, unique, and diverse country. I lived in the United States for two months. Of course, two months is too short to understand America. But it has given me enough time to know that America understands us so little, and we understand America so inadequately.

    I have traveled extensively in my life; I have traveled all over Europe. But after I came here, I was surprised at every step I took. Everything here is different: the cities, the trees, and the customs are all like that. I observe, and I try to understand America. A traveler who only sees fleeting things is pitiful; his eyes must know how to seek out things hidden in the shadows.

    When you stand on a bridge in New York City at dusk and look at New York, New York looks very magnificent. After seeing the skyscrapers, I went to the Mississippi River, where I saw "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and I did not regret this trip. I spent several interesting hours talking with writers, with people with great minds and great hearts. But my conversations with ordinary Americans in ordinary American cities were no less important, where only two or three skyscrapers were hidden above countless one-story houses; where a large number of exquisite and comfortable facilities coexisted with terrible prejudices; where those walking on "Main Street" were not the authors of those books already written and not yet written, but the heroes in the books.

    Almost as soon as I stepped off the plane that crossed the ocean, questions from American interviewers rained down on me. They didn't ask me about Russia; no, they only wanted to know one thing - "What are your impressions of America?" What could I tell them? About the customs officer with piercing eyes? About the blind ignorance of the interviewers? Now I have seen some, but before I can sit down and write, I must need time to think. I am prepared to learn great things from the Americans, but I am unwilling to learn the example of those American journalists who often write their books about the Soviet Union before coming to the Soviet Union.

    We know very little about America; our concepts of her advantages and failures are very general. There are not many articles about American life in our newspapers. The reason is not that we lack interest in it, but that we lack paper. If we had as much paper as the American press uses to describe the lives of Hollywood stars, we would know more about the real lives of the American people. But no one in our press has ever found any slander against the American people; we know very little, but what we know is the truth.

    Before the war, we printed many American writers' short stories and novels. Our readers were very fascinated by them, not only because they were good books, but also because we wanted to know how Americans live, how they think, and how they feel. Although there is a lot of paper in the United States, very few books by Soviet writers are printed here. Does this phenomenon show that American readers have no interest in Russian life? I do not believe. Of course, at present, we do not have Tolstoy and Chekhov, but we also have excellent writers. It's just that the eyes of American publishers have not turned to us. And here advertising occupies a position as important to the success of a book as the quality of the book.

    I was simply stunned by the questions from American interviewers: "Do Russians know that Americans helped them in the war? How do the citizens of Moscow understand the stock market? Why do your pants use buttons instead of zippers? Why do you only have one political party instead of two?" I believe that the average American must be better and more knowledgeable than the newspapers he reads; however, as a rule, he will unconsciously be influenced by newspapers, critics, and publishers. The average American thinks that his interests are directing the publishers, and his opinions are directing the editors; in reality, the interests and opinions of the average American are often dominated by editors and publishers.

    Although there are not many translations of Russian works in the United States, there are many books about Russia written by Americans. Some of them are very sincere, some have superficial views, and some are obviously distorting the facts. Unfortunately, there are many more books that fabricate than books that report. The funds of lie-makers circulate with high profits, because consumers have no opportunity to distinguish between lies and truth. It is unprofitable to advertise inferior cigarettes; smokers will not be deceived a second time. But how would the average American reader know whether a certain narrative about Soviet life is accurate, or whether another narrative is fabricated? (To be continued)

　　墨水和鲜血
    爱伦堡作，万歌译
    这是苏联名记者爱伦堡旅行了美国二月之后所写的文章，发表在柯里尔杂志上。爱伦堡氏对美国报纸向苏联所进行的诽谤，显出了无限的痛心。他要求美国人民小心提防，勿为记者们廉价的墨水竟付出了他们自己宝贵的鲜血。译文原载文汇报。（编者）
    美利坚合众国是一个巨大独特和多样的国家。我在美国住了两个月。当然，要认识美国，这两月还是嫌短促的。但是它已给了我足够的时间，使我们知道美国对我们了解的那么少，而我们对美国的了解也那么不够。
    我的一生中曾作过广泛的旅行；我已走遍了整个欧洲。可是我来到这里后，我每走一步便要吃一惊。这里每一样东西都不同：城市、树木和风俗都是这样。我观察着，我试着要懂得美国。只看见掠眼的东西的旅行者是可怜的；他的眼睛必须知道如何去寻求潜藏在阴暗中的事物。
    当你在暮色中站在纽约城的某桥上看纽约时，纽约显得很是宏丽，我在看了摩天楼后又去密士失必河，在那里我看到了“汤姆叔叔的小屋”（史杜夫人所著《黑奴吁天录》的原名——译者注），我并未为此行感觉遗憾。我曾花了好几个有趣味的钟点，和作家们谈话，和有着伟大思想和伟大心灵的人们谈话。但我在美国普通城市中和普通美国人的谈话也并不显得不重要，在那边只有二三座摩天楼隐现在无数一层楼房屋的上面；在那边一大批精致的舒适设备和可怖的偏见并存在一起，在那边在《大街》（辛克来·刘易士所著书名——译者注）上走着的并不是那些已写和未写的书籍的作者，而是书中的那些英雄。
    我在几乎还未跨下那越过重洋的飞机时，美国访员们的问题便大雨似的倾倒到我身上来了。他们并未向我问起俄国；不，他们只要知道一件事——“你对美国的印象怎样？”我能告诉他们什么呢？说那目光炯炯的海关关员么？说访员们的盲目无知么？现在我已看到一些，但是在我能坐下来写作之前，我必须需要时间来思考。我准备向美国人大事学习，但我不愿学那些美国新闻记者的榜样，他们常在来苏联以前便把他们关于苏联的书籍写好了。
    我们对美国知道得很少；我们对于她的优点和失败的概念是很概括的。在我们的报纸中，关于美国生活的文章并不多。原因并不是我们对它缺少兴趣而是缺少着纸头，如果我们的纸张能如美国报界用来描绘好莱坞影星生活的纸张那样多，我们对美国人民真正的生活将会知道得更多。但在我们的报界中从没人会找到反对美国人民的毁谤的；我们知道得很少，但我们所知道的却都是真理。
    在战前，我们印了不少美国作家的短篇故事和小说。我们的读者很受它们的迷惑，不但因为它们都是好书，也因为我们要知道美国人在如何生活，在如何思想，在如何感觉。虽则在美国有着许多纸张，但苏联作家的书籍却很少在这里被印行。这现象显出美国读者对俄国的生活无兴趣吗？我不相信。当然，在目前，我们确没有托尔斯泰和契珂夫，但我们也有着优秀的作家。只是美国出版商的眼睛并未移向我们。而这里广告在一本书的成功上正占着和书的品质一样重要的地位。
    我简直给美国访员的问题惊呆住了：“俄国人知道美国人曾在战事中援助他们吗？莫斯科的市民怎会懂得证券市场的？你的裤子为什么爱用钮扣而不用拉练？为什么你们只有一个政党而不是二个？“我相信一般的美国人一定要比他们所读的报纸要更为优良和有智识；可是，照例的他只会不知不觉地为报纸、批评家和出版商所影响。一般美国人以为他的兴味正左右着出版商，他的意见正左右着编辑人；实际上，一般美国人的兴味和意见是常为编辑和出版商支配着的。
    俄国作品的译本在美国虽不多，但由美国人写的关于俄国的书籍却不少，他们中有些很诚恳，有些看法很表面，有些是很明显的在歪曲事实。不幸的是伪造多于报导的书籍却很多。谎言制造者的资金周转是有着高额利润的，因为消费者没有机会来区分谎言和真理。为劣质香烟做广告是无利可图的；吸烟的人是不会受第二次骗。但一般美国读者又怎会知道某一关于苏联生活的叙述是准确的，而另一叙述又是伪造的呢？（未完待续）
