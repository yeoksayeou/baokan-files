　　Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 12:00 PM, 9th Dispatch: Yesterday, the Eighth Route Army annihilated over 2,500 of Chiang's troops in front of the Huailai position. This marks the third annihilating victory of the Eighth Route Army on the East Ping-Sui front against Chiang's forces. The annihilated Chiang troops were the entire 127th Regiment and attached artillery of the 43rd Division of the American-equipped 94th Army. This division was hastily transferred from the Beining Railway after the 16th Army of Chiang's forces suffered losses of over 6,000 men on the East Ping-Sui front. On the 6th and 7th of this month, the division passed through Baiyangcheng, Mapaoquan, and other locations. On the 8th, they launched a fierce attack on the Eighth Route Army positions in Changkuncheng and Hengxucheng, southeast of Huailai. A portion of the Eighth Route Army defenders rose up to counterattack. After a day of fierce fighting, the entire 127th Regiment and attached artillery of the 43rd Division were annihilated in the vicinity of Mapaoquan. Thus far, Chiang's forces have suffered nearly 10,000 casualties on the East Ping-Sui front and the flank of Yanqing. Since Chiang's forces ordered an attack on Zhangjiakou at 2:00 AM on the 29th of last month, it has been ten days. They have suffered an average loss of 1,000 men per day, advancing no more than 60 li, and are still over 200 li away from Zhangjiakou. According to preliminary statistics, the Eighth Route Army captured two mountain guns, three rocket launchers, four direct-fire guns, eight mortars, dozens of light and heavy machine guns, two radio stations, rifles, and many other military supplies during yesterday's battle, which are currently being inventoried.

　　Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 9th Dispatch: Soldiers of the 109th Division who have laid down their arms are discussing the combat situation of the Eighth Route Army that they personally experienced, in the rear not far from the front lines. Yang Yinhu, a Private First Class of the 335th Regiment, said: "The accuracy of the Eighth Route Army's shooting is something I have rarely encountered in my years of service. On the battlefield, the brothers dared not even look up. The officers said: 'The Eighth Route Army is using Japanese sharpshooters.' However, they were clearly shouting in Chinese: 'Lay down your arms! Chinese people don't fight Chinese people!'. Once, two of our machine guns in the trenches were blown away by three shells from the Eighth Route Army." A young soldier with a shrapnel wound near his right eye said: "Those people (referring to the Eighth Route Army) deliberately fired potshots to scare you into the trenches, but then they had grenades ready below. Fortunately, our entire squad raised our hands quickly, otherwise, we would have died for Chiang Kai-shek for nothing. I was lucky to get only a minor injury to my eye." Li Yuchi, with a bandage around his arm, told a story: "Our company clearly knew that the 357th Regiment was stationed in the East and West Gardens, but who knew that when we entered the village, it was all Eighth Route Army. We didn't realize it until they shouted 'Lay down your arms!' Your American weapons are useless. It's okay if you don't shoot, but as soon as the guns fire, the Eighth Route Army rushes straight at you, specifically targeting your machine guns."

　　怀来我军三次大捷
    蒋军援兵二千五就歼
    无数美械装备均被我军缴获
    【新华社平绥东线九日十二时急电】昨日八路军于怀来阵地前沿再歼蒋军二千五百余人，这是平绥东线正面八路军对蒋军第三次歼灭性的胜利。被歼蒋军系美械装备的九十四军四十三师之一二七团全部及附属炮兵；该师为平绥东线蒋军十六军损失六千余人后，慌忙自北宁路调来。本月六七两日，该师经白阳城马跑泉等地，于八日向怀来东南之长昆城、横序城八路军阵地猛攻，八路军守军一部奋起反击，激战竟日，蒋军四十三师一二七团与附属炮兵于马跑泉附近地区全部歼灭。至此，平绥东线及延庆侧翼蒋军前后损失已近万人。自蒋军于上月二十九日晨二时下令进攻张家口，迄昨已有十天，平均每日损失千人，推进不过六十里，而距张家口尚在两百里以上。据初步统计，昨日战斗中八路军缴获山炮二门、火箭炮三门、平射炮四门、迫击炮八门、轻重机枪数十挺、电台两部、步枪及其他军用品甚多，正清查中。
    【新华社平绥东线九日电】放下武器的一○九师士兵，在离前线不远的后方，谈论着他们亲身经历过的八路军的作战情形。三三五团上等兵杨银湖说：“八路军射击准确是我当了几年兵很少遇到的，战场上弟兄们都不敢抬起头来望。长官说：‘八路军用的是日本射手’。可是，人家明明地喊着：‘缴枪呀！中国人不打中国人！’的中国话。有一次俺们战壕里两挺机枪被八路军三炮就给打飞了。”一个右眼被手榴弹片擦伤的青年士兵说：“人家（指八路军）的士兵故意放冷枪，把你吓得钻在战壕里，可是下边手榴弹早就准备好了，我们全班幸亏举的手快，没替蒋介石当了屈死鬼。我这眼挨点轻伤，总算是运气了。”手臂缠了绷带的李玉池讲了一段故事：“俺们那连明明知道东西花园住的是三五七团，谁知道进了村都是八路军。直到人家喊‘缴枪’，还摸不着头脑。任凭你美国枪械也不灵了。不打还好，枪一响，八路军就直扑上来，专找你的机枪。”
