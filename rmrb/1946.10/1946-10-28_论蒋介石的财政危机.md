　　On Chiang Kai-shek's Financial Crisis
    Xu Fanglue
    The Chiang government's finances have reached an unprecedented level of expansion. In terms of monetary revenue and expenditure, last year's final accounts showed expenditures exceeding 1.2 trillion (budgeted at 260 billion), and this year's budget is 2.5 trillion, which was entirely used up by May. By July and August, according to Long Chengzhi's calculation in the September 23rd issue of Wenhui Daily, monthly expenditures had reached about 1 trillion, equivalent to 1,650 times the average monthly expenditure from 1937 to 1942, and more than 20,000 times the average monthly expenditure during the rule of the Northern Warlords in 1925. In terms of grain revenue and expenditure, this year's land tax (including requisitioned and borrowed public grain) totaled 257,717,000 piculs (market standard) of grain (Reuters, August 17th), several times more than last year.
    The rapid expansion of finance is a direct result of Chiang Kai-shek's launch of an all-out civil war. Chiang Kai-shek mobilized 3.8 million troops in the army, navy, and air force, so the monthly salary alone requires more than 500 billion, and the total military expenditure is far more than that. And all the expenses of the Party affairs, secret service, police, internal affairs, judiciary, financial and economic departments—this extremely large bureaucratic fascist war and the institution of enslaving the people—bear a ratio of one to three with the military expenditure, requiring 200 billion per month; these two constitute the vast majority of monetary expenditure. In terms of grain, the 3.8 million troops need more than 21 million piculs of rice per year, or more than 40 million piculs of grain, which is equal to the total amount of land tax requisitioned and borrowed by Chiang Kai-shek's "central government." However, the grain needed by the huge bureaucratic internal war machine is not included.
    The huge expenditure of the civil war has brought a heavy burden to the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The 300 million people under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, including men, women, and children, bear an annual burden of 200,000 and 1.7 piculs of grain per household (averaging five people). But the actual burden is much greater than the above figures. Because the number of people mobilized for war by Chiang Kai-shek now, in addition to the regular army, is at least 20 million; these are mainly met by local conscription and apportionment. In addition, there are several times more extortion and embezzlement than regular income.
    Astronomical financial expenditures cannot but cause Chiang Kai-shek's financial crisis to deepen. Last year's monetary revenue and expenditure deficit accounted for 4.3 times the annual income, and this year's is even greater. The monthly income in July and August, including normal tax revenue (the largest being customs import duties), the surplus of the China Textile Company, the sale of enemy and puppet industries, the sale of gold and foreign exchange, and the sale of surplus materials and relief materials relying on "American Dad," totaled only 175 billion (Long's calculation); accounting for only 17.5 percent of the monthly expenditure, the deficit was 4.7 times the income, and its absolute value (more than 800 billion) was nine times the average monthly deficit of last year (slightly less than 90 billion). In terms of grain revenue and expenditure, less than half of last year's land tax was collected until January this year (Business Daily, February this year), and since then, due to severe disasters, very little has been collected. This year, the collection has been several times more than last year, but the disasters have expanded even more. Contrary to the Chiang government's propaganda of "bumper harvest"; according to Kuang Ri'an's calculation in Economic Weekly (Vol. 3, No. 12), the harvest in the entire Chiang-controlled area is only 70% of the normal year, with a shortage of more than 260 million piculs of grain; even with the 200,000 tons of monthly imported relief grain promised by Hoover, and the imports from Siam and Vietnam, there is still a shortage of 200 million piculs. Undoubtedly, it will be more difficult to collect the full amount of grain this year, and Chiang Kai-shek cannot completely solve the serious panic of money and grain by relying on "American Dad's" "relief."
    Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek can only resort to the path of unlimited issuance of inconvertible paper money to continue his anti-people criminal war. At present, the issuance speed of "legal tender" and Chiang's "Northeast Circulation Coupons" is such that the daily printing of banknotes in Shanghai alone has reached more than 23 billion (United Evening News, October 17), which is the only "source of income" for the Chiang government's monthly deficit of 82.5 percent, or more than 800 billion. As early as August last year, the number of banknotes issued had reached more than 10 trillion ("Financial Review" Vol. 14, No. 5 and Associated Press reporters' information). According to the prediction of Democratic Weekly, it will reach 20 trillion by the end of this year. The latter estimate will inevitably become a reality according to the current speed. The annual increase is several times more than the total amount of the Chiang government's past 18 years, and 7,500 times more than the total amount of its pre-war rule of ten years. This is the basic factor for the price increase of more than 10,000 times before the war, and cruelly plundering and attacking the people of all classes holding Chiang coins.
    Another result of Chiang Kai-shek's indiscriminate issuance of paper money is to strengthen the dependence of Chiang coins on the US dollar and the colonialization of China. Chiang Kai-shek's comprador government's "legal tender" had already changed from a joint vassal of the pound and the dollar before the war to a sole vassal of the dollar after the Pacific War, and the credit of Chiang coins was supported by the dollar. Due to the indiscriminate issuance of Chiang coins, its actual value internally is lower than the huge difference between the external surface "credit" (expressed as the foreign exchange rate is lower than the multiple of price increase) stipulated by force, so it must rely on the foreign exchange fund of the American creditor. (According to reliable estimates, the Chiang government's $500 million foreign exchange fund in February this year has been almost used up.) The expansion (ie devaluation) of Chiang coins constantly increases the Chiang government's debt to the United States, thus strengthening the United States' rule over the Chiang government.
    Not only that, the unlimited expansion of Chiang coins is also a lever to further expand and aggravate the financial and economic crisis of the Chiang government. The vicious inflation and the resulting great destruction of agricultural and industrial productivity and the great disorder of the economy make it impossible to increase the number of financial currency revenues and expenditures, and make it increasingly difficult to obtain physical income. In this way, a vicious cycle of mutual influence and mutual promotion of the financial, currency and production crises in the Chiang-controlled areas has been formed; as a result, the entire social economy in the Chiang-controlled areas and Chiang Kai-shek's finances themselves are pushed to total collapse.
    Huge burdens such as inflation, grain levy, taxes, conscription, and collection have now driven the 300 million people in the Chiang-controlled areas to rise from the abyss of hunger and death and fight for survival. In the past year, the strikes and work stoppages in Shanghai, Chongqing, Pingjin and other places, the strikes and teaching strikes, the rice riots in Zhejiang and other places, and the civil unrest in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi and other provinces are fundamentally caused by resisting the tyrannical policies of Chiang government's internal war dictatorship and extortion, and the soaring prices caused by it. In particular, the rising civil unrest, with "resistance to grain" and "resistance to conscription" becoming their main slogans. All this is a volcano under Chiang Kai-shek's feet.

　　论蒋介石的财政危机
    徐方略
    蒋政府的财政已达空前的膨胀程度，在货币收支方面，去年决算岁出一万二千余亿（预算二千六百亿），今年预算为二万五千亿，至五月已全部用光。到七、八月间，根据九月二十三日文汇报载龙成志氏的计算，每月支出已达一万亿左右，等于一九三七至四二年每月平均开支的一千六百五十倍，等于北洋军阀统治的一九二五年每月平均开支的二万余倍。在粮食收支方面，今年田赋（包括征实、征借公粮）共二亿五千七百十七万市担粮食（路透社八月十七日电），倍于去年之数。
    财政急速度的膨胀，是蒋介石发动全面内战的直接结果。蒋介石动员了陆海空军三百八十万人，因此单是薪饷每月就需五千余亿元，全部军事费当远不止此。而所有党务、特务、警察、内政、司法、财政经济各部门——这种极庞大的官僚法西斯的战争与奴役人民的机构的费用，与军事费用成一与三之比，月需二千亿元；二者构成货币开支的绝大部分。在粮食方面，三百八十万人的军队年需食米二千一百余万市担，合谷四千余万市担，已与田赋征实、征借缴归蒋介石“中央”的全数相等。但庞大的官僚内战机构所需粮食，尚未计内。
    内战的巨大支出，带给蒋管区人民以沉重的负担。蒋介石统治下的三亿人民，包括男女老幼，每户（平均以五口计）依上述支出数计算，每年的负担竟达二十万元及粮食一市担七斗。但实际负担比上述数字还要大过很多。因为目前蒋介石战争动员的人数，除正规军外，至少还有两千万人；这些主要的是以就地征发摊派来满足的。此外，还有数倍于正规收入的敲诈勒索与贪污中饱。
    天文数字的财政支出，不能不造成蒋介石财政日益深刻的危机。去年的货币收支赤字占岁收四点三倍，今年的更大。七八月间的每月收入，包括正常税收（最大的是海关进口税）、中纺公司盈余、敌伪产业标卖、抛售黄金外汇以及依靠“美国爸爸”的剩余物资与救济物资的出售，总共不过一千七百五十亿（龙氏计算）；只占月支的百分之十七点五，赤字为收入的四点七倍，其绝对数（八千余亿）为去年每月平均赤字（九百亿弱）的九倍。在粮食收支方面，去年的田赋直到今年一月收到不及半数（本年二月商务日报），此后灾荒严重，所收更是无几。今年来征收数倍于去年，但灾荒却更扩大了。与蒋政府“丰收”的宣传正相反；根据邝日安氏在经济周报（三卷十二期）的计算，全蒋管区收成只及常年的七成，短产粮食二亿六千余万市担；即便加上胡佛所允诺的每月进口救济粮食二十万吨，及暹罗、越南的进口，仍短少二亿市担。无疑的，今年的征粮势必更难足额，严重的钱财与粮食的不断恐慌，蒋介石不能依靠“美国爸爸”的“救济”而完全解决的。
    因此，蒋介石只能乞灵于无限制滥发不兑现纸币的一途，来继续其反人民的罪恶战争。目前“法币”及蒋记“东北流通券”的发行速度，仅上海一战，每日印钞已达二百三十余亿（十月十七日联合晚报），这就是蒋政府每月赤字百分之八十二点五，即八千余亿元的唯一“财源”。早在去年八月，发钞数已达十万余亿（“财政评论”十四卷五期及合众社记者息）。据民主周刊的预测，今年年底将达二十万亿。后一估计，按照目前速度看来，必将成为现实。一年的增发额倍于蒋政府过去十八个年头的总数，七千五百倍于其战前统治的十个年头的总数。这是物价高涨到战前一万倍以上的基本因素，而残酷的掠夺着打击着持有蒋币的各阶层人民。
    蒋介石滥发纸币的另一结果，就是加强了蒋币对美元的依附性与中国的殖民地化。蒋介石买办政府的“法币”，早在太平洋战争后就从战前英镑与美元的共同附庸变为美元独占的附庸了，蒋币的信用是以美元来支持的。由于蒋币滥发，造成其对内实际价值低于由强制规定的对外表面“信用”（表现为外汇率低于物价上涨倍数）的巨大差额，以致必须依靠美国债主的外汇基金来维持。（根据可靠估计，今年二月蒋政府所有的五亿美元外汇基金，已经差不多用完了。）蒋币膨胀（即贬值）就不断的增加蒋政府对美负债，因而也就加强了美国对蒋政府的统治。
    不仅这样，蒋币的无限制膨胀，又是使蒋政府财政与经济危机更加扩大与严重的杠杆。恶性通货膨胀及其所造成的农工业生产力的大破坏与经济的大紊乱，使财政货币收支数字不能不增大，并使实物收入日益困难。这样，就形成了蒋管区财政、通货与生产危机，不能交互影响交互推动的恶性循环；其结果，推动着蒋管区整个社会经济与蒋介石财政本身走到总崩溃。
    通货膨胀、征粮、税收、征发、收派等巨大负担，现在已驱逼了蒋管区三亿人民不得不从饥饿死亡深渊里起来，为要求生存而抗争。一年来沪渝平津等地的罢工、罢业，罢课、罢教，浙江等地的抢米骚动，及苏浙皖川湘滇黔陕等省的民变，其根本原因之一，就是反抗蒋政府内战独裁横征暴敛的苛政，及其所造成的物价的飞涨。特别是风起云涌的民变，“抗粮”与“抗丁”成为他们的主要口号。这一切，正是蒋介石自己脚下的一座火山。
