(Dispatch from the Ji-Lu-Yu [冀鲁豫] Border Region, October 15th from our newspaper) (Delayed) The struggle of the masses in the Seventh District of Dongping County against traitors and local bullies has gradually reached a climax, and a liquidation movement against the "Hall of a Hundred Tolerances" Li family, a despotic landlord in Dizi Village, has begun. More than 800 peasants from twelve villages, carrying red-tasseled spears and earthen cannons, recently settled blood debts with the "Hall of a Hundred Tolerances" Li family of despotic landlords. For more than 200 years, as a result of hoarding and speculation, and clever plundering, the despotic landlords of the Li family annexed more than 30 qing of farmers' land, causing a large number of farmers to lose their land and die of hunger. In 1937, Dongping suffered a major famine. The Li family hoarded 600 dan of wheat. Local farmers were starving everywhere, and the corpses of the dead were piled up. However, the Li family transported the wheat to Lijin, west of the river, and sold it at high prices. In order to raise the price of grain, they would rather let more than 100 dan of wheat rot than sell it to farmers without grain. Driven by hunger, farmers had no choice but to sell their land at low prices, and the Li family used the method of measuring land with large rulers (measuring eight-tenths more than ten mu) to encroach on and annex farmers' land. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Li family relied even more on the power of the enemy, privately establishing a "public hall," committing all kinds of evil deeds, and forcing fourteen people to death. At the grievance meetings, many old ladies cried bitterly when they talked about the misery of being exploited by the "Hall of a Hundred Tolerances." An old lady surnamed Bai, over seventy years old, worked as a maid for the Li family for three years when she was twenty-eight years old, without receiving a penny of wages, and was dismissed and became a beggar. Her son was also forced to die outside the Guanshan Pass. When she said, "I worked for the landlord's family for three years and didn't see a single penny, forcing my son to die outside the Guanshan Pass, and then I was dismissed for no reason, forcing me to beg for food," she fainted on the spot. The whole audience was filled with grief and indignation, and successively presented 281 charges against the Li family, demanding that the government avenge the masses. According to the accusations of the masses in twelve villages, the Dongping County Government, in addition to ordering the traitorous and despotic landlord to compensate the masses for their losses and return the land to the masses, will deal with his collusion with the enemy separately according to the law.

　　东平七区农民持枪炮托誓雪生死恨
    痛斗恶毒奸霸索还血债
    “百忍堂”逼死人命十四条榨取土地三千多亩
    十二村群众悲愤填膺奋起控诉讨回全部损失
    【本报冀鲁豫十五日电】（迟到）东平县七区群众反奸反恶霸的斗争逐渐走上高潮，已展开了对堤子村“百忍堂”李家恶霸地主的清算运动。十二个村的农民八百余人，于日前扛着红缨枪和土炮向“百忍堂”李家恶霸地主清算血海冤仇。该恶霸地主二百多年以来，由于囤积居奇，巧取豪夺的结果，兼并农民土地三十多顷，以致农民大量失去土地，纷纷饥饿死亡。民国二十六年，东平遭大灾荒，李家囤积麦子六百石，当地农民饿莩载道，死亡枕籍，李家却将麦子运到河西利津高价出售。为了抬高粮价，宁使麦子腐烂一百余石，亦不卖给无粮农民。农民迫于饥饿，不得不忍痛贱卖土地，李家则以大尺子量地办法（十亩多量八分），侵占兼并农民土地。抗战后，李家更依仗敌势，私立“公堂”，为非作恶，曾逼死人命十四条。在诉苦会中，许多老太太谈到自己被“百忍堂”压榨之惨状时，即嚎淘痛哭。一个年逾七十岁的白老太太，于二十八岁时给李家当了三年女佣人，未得分文工钱，被辞退流为乞丐，儿子亦逼得死在关外。当她说到：“我给东家干了三年，没见一个小钱，逼得我儿子死在关外，后来又无缘无故辞退我，逼得我去要饭”时，即昏倒在地。全场悲愤填膺，先后提出李家二百八十一条罪状，纷纷要求政府替群众报仇雪恨。东平县县政府根据十二个村群众控诉，除让该奸霸地主赔偿群众损失，退还群众的土地外，其通敌部分，另依法处理。
