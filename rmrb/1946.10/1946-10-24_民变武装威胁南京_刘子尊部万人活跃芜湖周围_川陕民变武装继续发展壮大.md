Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to the Shanghai News on the 9th of last month, armed popular uprisings are very active in Wuhu and Fanchang in southern Anhui, and Wuxi in southern Jiangsu, around Nanjing. Liu Zizun's forces of more than 10,000 around Wuhu have recently been active in Fanchang, Nanling, Kuitan, and the Dainanwei area of southern Wuhu, and have joined forces with local people's armed forces, fighting the Chiang troops many times. Gu Fuxing's former subordinates, Zhan Sheng, Wu Xichuan, Zhang Wenlong, Xue Yonghui, and others around Wuxi, possess many machine guns and rifles. At noon on September 16, when Hu Shaomei, attached to the Wuxi Security Brigade, led his troops to Sunli Village, Jinghui Township, and other places to "surround and search," the armed popular uprising forces engaged them in a fierce battle for half an hour. Hu was wounded in the face, and the people's armed forces safely withdrew.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 20th: According to the Xi'an Northwest Cultural Daily on the 3rd of this month, two more people's armed forces have appeared in Shanyang County, Shaanxi. One force of more than 1,000 people in the Liangcha River area recently detoured from near Daping to attack the county seat. The Kuomintang County Chief Sun Junbo and the Three People's Principles Youth League Director Zhao were extremely panicked and personally arranged city defenses, and transferred the Self-Defense Brigade to reinforce. Near Fengzhen in the county, on the 28th of last month, there were 500 people's armed forces who came from Hongyan Temple and fought fiercely for five hours with the reactionary armed forces led by Dao Shangyou, the secretary-general of the Kuomintang County Party Committee.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to the Rong Xin China Daily, Yu Dagong Daily, New Shu Daily, etc., armed popular uprisings have appeared in Leibo, Changning, Gulan, Longchang and other counties in Sichuan in September and October. One force in Leibo is an Yi ethnic armed force, led by Lao Mushi Du, who started the uprising in Qingkou, and moved around in the Greater Liang Mountains. The county chief led a team to suppress them, but dared not continue advancing after reaching Lianhua Stone, and only seized four yellow cattle from the people and returned to the county. One force in Gulan is a newly emerging unit of Chen Ruixiang's Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Guerrilla Brigade after turning to Changjiang Zhangshan, traveling between the high mountains and dangerous roads of Xugong to Gulan, a distance of 140 li. One force in Longchang is a force expanded from two companies of mutinous soldiers, led by Zhang Ruiting, operating at the junction of Longchang, Rongchang, and Neijiang. In addition, the people's forces between the seven counties of Guang'an, Zhengshui, Dianjiang, Hechuan, Changshou, Wusheng, and Jiangbei have become active again since the Kuomintang's American-equipped 4th Army was transferred away. According to the Yu Dagong Daily on September 1, this force is based in Huaying Mountain with more than 700 people. The popular uprisings in Jiangjin, Emei, Leshan, and Shifang are constantly developing. The rebels in the Wutongqiao area of Leshan often seize the guns of the garrison sentries at night to equip themselves. The Emei rebels recently engaged in a fierce battle with the local police in Yangcun, Emei County, for as long as eight hours with an inferior force of only eleven people before safely retreating.
