Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 1st. Wherever the Chiang troops invade, the people's self-defense guerrilla warfare develops there. When the Chiang troops advanced south along the Grand Canal line and occupied Zhongxing Town, northwest of Huaiyin, on September 14, the people's guerrilla forces in the Zhongxing and Baji districts of Siyang and Shuyang counties became active on the vast plains more than 20 miles north of Zhongxing, engaging in fierce battles with the Chiang troops and hindering their advance. On September 23, 400 Chiang troops, carrying six heavy machine guns and several small cannons, harassed Zhuangtan and Wanji. Before they could cross the Liutang River, they were fiercely intercepted by the Zhongxing District guerrilla force, forcing the Chiang troops to withdraw from strongholds such as Jinwei, Dizhuang, and Tangzhuang. On the night of September 17, the guerrilla force of the district operated near the suburbs of Zhongxing Town, distributing propaganda materials, and penetrated deep into the forest north of Wulidu, capturing six secret agents alive. On the night of September 23, the Suqian guerrilla force raided the Chiang troops in Mayao, seven miles northeast of the city. After an hour of fierce fighting, the Chiang troops in the area were completely wiped out, killing seven and capturing sixteen alive. More than 80 Chiang troops in Xingren Town, Nantong, invaded Fantan and other places northeast of Nantong on September 13. They were defeated by the local militia district team, which killed more than 10 Chiang soldiers, captured more than 20, and seized more than 10 rifles.

　　苏北人民游击队活跃不断打击阻扰进犯军
    【新华社沭阳一日电】蒋军进犯到那里，人民自卫游击战就发展到那里。当蒋军沿运河线南犯于九月十四日进占淮阴西北众兴镇后，泗（阳）沭（阳）县众兴八集两区人民游击队即活跃于众兴北郊广阔二十余里的平原上，与蒋军展开激烈战斗，阻扰蒋军的前进。九月二十三日，蒋军四百携重机枪六挺，小炮数门，分向庄滩万集两地出扰，还没有渡过六塘河，就遭到众兴区游击队猛烈阻击，迫使蒋军退出金圩、荻庄、塘庄等据点。九月十七日夜，该区游击队曾活动至众兴镇近郊，散发宣传品，并深入五里渡北森林中，活捉特务六名。宿迁游击队于九月二十三日夜袭该城东北七里马窑之蒋军，经一小时激战，将该地蒋军全部消灭，击毙蒋军七名，生俘十六名。南通兴仁镇蒋军八十余于九月十三日进犯南通东北燔毯等地，被该地民兵区队将其击溃，毙蒋军十余名，俘二十余，缴获步枪十余支。
