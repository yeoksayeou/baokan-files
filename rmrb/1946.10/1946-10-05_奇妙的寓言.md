　　A Strange Fable
　　According to a Nanjing dispatch entitled "Dead End," published in the Chongqing New China Daily on September 10th:
　　"A wonderfully clever political fable has become popular in Nanjing political circles recently. Almost everyone who hears this story bursts out laughing from the bottom of their hearts, and even those involved cannot help but smile knowingly. The story goes like this: The five great powers, the United States, Britain, China, the Soviet Union, and France, are playing mahjong. In the first four rounds, China 'dreams' and loses badly to the United States; in the second four rounds, China 'dreams' that the United States happens to win big, so China gets some 'dream money' and is quite satisfied; in the third four rounds, the United States and China are both at the table, with the United States as China's upper hand. The United States, having already won quite a bit, doesn't want to win, so it recklessly discards tiles to China, trying to buy China off. But no matter how the United States discards, China can't win and continues to lose badly. Later, the upper hand, the United States, gets anxious and flips over China's tiles to look, and it turns out that China is going for 'Pure One Suit'!"
　　The article continues: "The problem lies in the fact that the Chinese government is single-mindedly focused on 'Pure One Suit,' and although the U.S. government's policy clearly knows that China is going for 'Pure One Suit' and also knows that it will certainly not succeed, it is still desperately discarding tiles. The Kuomintang sees that the upper hand will always discard tiles, so it is even more determined to go for 'Pure One Suit.' The 'Pure One Suit' that the Kuomintang is playing is, of course, the dictatorship and autocracy of a minority."

　　奇妙的寓言
    据九月十日重庆新华日报所载题为“绝路”的南京通讯中称：
    “南京政治界近来普遍流行个神乎其技的政治寓言，凡是听到这故事的人，几乎没有不从心的深处放声大笑的，即使是当事人，也不能不会心的微笑。故事是这样：美、英、中、苏、法五强打麻将，前四圈，美国‘作梦’中国大输；第二个四圈，中国‘作梦’美国恰好大赢，于是中国分了些‘梦钱’，颇为满意；第三个四圈，美中两国都上桌，美国作中国上手，美国因已赢得不少，自己不想和牌，于是不顾一切放牌给下手中国，以图收买中国，但无论美国如何放牌，中国总是和不了，仍然输得很凶，后来上手美国急了，把中国的牌翻开来看，原来中国在作‘清一色’！”
    该文接着写道：“问题就在于中国政府不顾一切埋头作‘清一色’，而美国政府的政策虽明知中国在作‘清一色’，而且也知道一定不会成功，而仍然拚命放牌，国民党看准了上手总会放牌，也就更加决心作‘清一色’。国民党所作的‘清一色’当然就是少数人的独裁专制。”
