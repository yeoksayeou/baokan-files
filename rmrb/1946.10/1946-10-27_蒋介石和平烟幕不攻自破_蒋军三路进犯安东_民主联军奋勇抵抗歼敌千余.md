Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: Chiang's troops, with the strength of three divisions, launched a military offensive against the South Manchurian Andong liberated area from Dashiqiao (south of Haicheng), Benxi, and Xinbin in three routes, beginning on the 20th of this month. This event occurred one day before the Chiang side's representatives used airplanes to bring representatives of various parties and social figures from Shanghai to Nanjing to resume "peace" talks, and is the first direct result of the military conference convened by Chen Cheng in Peiping. On that day, the main force of the 14th Division and the remnants of the 184th Division of Chiang's troops in Dashiqiao, totaling more than a thousand people, divided their forces to invade Gaiping and Tanghe (15 kilometers southeast of Dashiqiao). The 25th Division of Chiang's troops in Benxi and Langzishan (more than 30 kilometers southeast of Liaoyang) then invaded Pingdingshan (20 kilometers southeast of Qiaotou), Xiaoshi (30 kilometers east of Benxi) and other places. The 195th Division of Chiang's troops in Xinbin also invaded Rizhixian, Bianmen and other places on the same day. The Democratic Allied Forces actively counterattacked and have already killed, wounded, and captured 1,200 Chiang soldiers. On the evening of the 20th, the 2nd Battalion of the 585th Regiment of the 195th Division of Chiang's troops departed from Xinbin, and was soon surrounded midway by the local Democratic Allied Forces. It was completely annihilated within a few hours, killing more than 170 people, capturing more than 130 alive, and seizing eight light machine guns, five 60mm mortars, and more than 130 rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 24th: Military observers here recently commented on Chiang's troops' attack on the South Manchurian liberated area, saying: Amidst the so-called "peaceful settlement" in Nanjing, the Northeast Chiang troops once again tore up the two truce agreements of June 7th and September 23rd on the 20th and launched an attack on the South Manchurian liberated area, attempting to seize Andong and Tonghua. As for what medicine Chiang Kai-shek's "peace" gourd is selling in the north, it is already clear to the world. What kind of trick Chen Cheng played by convening a military conference with Xiong Shihui, Du Yuming, and others in Beiping can also be explained by the facts. The observer stated that this attack by Chiang's troops has broken the scale of local battles in the Northeast over the past four months. However, at the beginning of this offensive, the contradictions and weaknesses of Chiang's troops have been fully exposed. First, Chiang's troops have insufficient troops. On the 350-kilometer front line from Dashiqiao to Xinbin, Chiang's troops only have three divisions, but their strategic attempt is to vainly attempt to outflank the Andong liberated area from the north and south, so they will inevitably be defeated. Second, the masses in the South Manchurian liberated area have been mobilized the fastest and best, and their political consciousness has been raised to an unprecedented level. In addition, natural conditions such as uneven terrain and inconvenient transportation will greatly restrict Chiang's troops and increase the favorable conditions for the Democratic Allied Forces to maneuver and annihilate the enemy. Third, the Democratic Allied Forces have gained several months of rest and reorganization since the Haicheng-Anshan battle, and their morale is increasing day by day; while Chiang's troops are being transferred from east to west, and the battle on the Shen-Ji line has just ended, and they have been put into the South Manchurian front line again; people are tired and horses are exhausted, and morale is low. The military and civilians in the South Manchurian liberated area have now been urgently mobilized and are preparing to give the invading Chiang troops a head-on blow.

　　蒋介石和平烟幕不攻自破
    蒋军三路进犯安东
    民主联军奋勇抵抗歼敌千余
    【新华社东北二十四日电】蒋军以三个师兵力由大石桥（海城南）、本溪、新宾分三路出动，向南满安东解放区的军事进攻，已于本月二十日开始。此事正发生于蒋方代表以飞机将各党派与社会贤达代表自沪接入南京恢复“和平”商谈之前一日，为陈诚在平召开之军事会议第一个直接结果。是日大石桥蒋军十四师主力及一八四师残部共千余人，分兵侵占盖平及汤河（大石桥东南十五公里），本溪及浪子山（辽阳东南三十余公里）之蒋军二十五师则侵占平顶山（桥头东南廿公里）、小市（本溪东三十公里）等地，新宾蒋军一九五师亦于同日侵占日线、边门等地；民主联军积极反击，已毙伤俘蒋军千二百名。二十日晚蒋军一九五师五八五团第二营由新宾出发，不久即被当地民主联军中途包围，数小时内全部歼灭，毙其一百七十余名，生俘一百三十余名，缴获轻机枪八挺，六○小炮五门，步枪一百三十余支。
    【新华社东北廿四日电】此间军事观察家顷评论蒋军对南满解放区的进攻称：在南京所谓“和平解决”声中，东北蒋军于廿日又一次撕毁六月七日及九月廿三日两次停战协定，发动向南满解放区的进攻，企图夺取安东与通化。至北，蒋介石“和平”葫芦里卖的什么药，已经大白于世了。陈诚在北平召集熊式辉杜聿明等举行军事会议搞的什么名堂，也可以事实来说明了。观察家称：蒋军这一进攻已打破了四个月来东北局部战斗的规模。但是，此次进攻一开始，蒋军的矛盾与弱点便已充分暴露。第一，蒋军兵力不足，从大石桥到新宾三百五十公里的前线上，蒋军只有三个师兵力，但其战略企图则为妄想南北迂回安东解放区，故必遭覆败。第二，南满解放区群众发动得最快最好，政治觉悟空前提高，再加上地势不平及交通不使等自然条件，将大大束缚蒋军手足，增加了民主联军机动歼敌的有利条件。第三，民主联军自海城鞍山作战以来，已获数月休整，士气日盛；而蒋军则东调西遣，沈吉线战事甫告段落，即又投入南满前线；人困马乏，士气不振。现南满解放区军民业已紧急动员起来，准备给进犯蒋军以迎头痛击。
