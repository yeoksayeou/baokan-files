　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th: According to the US News Agency, when US President Truman delivered a speech at the opening of the UN General Assembly on the 23rd, he generally discussed the UN and world peace, as well as the general abstract principles of US foreign policy. Truman first stated: "Recently, I have heard people talking about the possibility of another world war, which has caused widespread fear around the world. This fear is unfounded. ... If rumors of war are not curbed, they will inevitably hinder the world's recovery." Truman admitted that "the people of all countries are disgusted with war. They deeply know the pain of war and the futility of war. No responsible government can ignore this universal sentiment." Furthermore, Truman stated that "the United States does not and will not want to wage war with the people of any place in the world." Truman believed that it was easier for countries to agree on "the ideal of peace" than to achieve peace. Truman said that the attainment of lasting peace "depends on four basic freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religious belief, freedom from poverty, and freedom from fear." Truman emphasized freedom from fear and believed that "every member state of the United Nations must not threaten or use force in its international relations to undermine the territorial integrity or political independence of any country." At this point, Truman plagiarized a famous quote that Wallace used more than a month ago to criticize current US foreign policy (this famous quote had already been plagiarized by Byrnes a few days ago). Truman said: "We must not allow different views on economic and social systems to hinder our progress toward peace, and allow different political philosophies to undermine the United Nations, resulting in an inseparable division that will bring disaster to the world." Then he said, "The United States will continue to seek solutions to the problems that come with war." But how to "seek solutions"? How to specifically "seek solutions" to the many existing differences between the three powers, such as the five-nation treaty, the policy toward Germany, and the issues of China and Japan? Truman lightly brushed over these. He focused the "seeking solutions" on the "issue of international atomic energy control," believing that its outcome "will determine the future security of the United Nations and its member states." Then Truman warned: "Unless substantial progress is made in the next few years, the world will still not be free from the fear of war." Truman also declared: "The course of history has made the United States one of the world's great powers, so we have a special responsibility to preserve our strength and use it appropriately in today's world. They will do their best to shoulder this responsibility."

　　杜鲁门在联合国大会演说
    居然侈谈“四大自由”
    所说的话与其行动恰正相反
    【新华社二十七日电】据美新闻处纽约讯：美总统杜鲁门于二十三日联合国大会开幕时发表演说，泛论联合国与世界和平以及美国外交政策的一般的抽象的原则。杜氏首称：“近来余闻一般人谈论另一次世界大战之可能，已引起全世界普遍之恐惧，此种恐惧并无根据。……………对于战争之谣言若不予以遏止，势必阻止世界之复兴。”杜氏承认“各国人民是厌恶战争的，他们深知战争之痛苦及战争之无济于事。凡属负责之政府，无一能忽视此种普遍之情绪”。进而杜氏表示“美国不论现在或将来均不愿与世界任何一处人民发生战争”。杜氏认为各国同意“和平之理想”较易，而获致和平则较难。杜氏说永久和平之获得，“系于四大基本自由，即言论自由，宗教信仰自由，免于贫困的自由以及免于恐惧的自由”。杜氏强调免于恐惧的自由，并认为“联合国每一会员国，在其国际关系中必不可威胁或运用武力以破坏任何一国之领土完整或政治独立”。至此，杜鲁门抄袭一个多月以前华莱士用以抨击美国现行外交政策的名言（这名言数天前即已为贝纳斯抄袭过一次了），杜氏说：“吾人决不允许经济及社会制度上之相异的见解妨碍吾人走向和平，一任不同的政治哲学破坏联合国，成为不可结合的分裂，将给世界带来灾患。”接着他说：“对于与战争俱来之问题，美国将继续觅取解决。”但是如何“觅取解决”呢？三强间现存的许多分歧，如五国和约，对德政策，对中国和日本问题等等，又如何具体的“觅取解决”呢？对于这些杜鲁门轻轻的溜过去了，他把“觅取解决”的重点放在“国际原子能管制问题”上面，他认为其结果“将决定联合国及其会员国之未来安全”。接着杜鲁门即警告说：“除非未来数年中获致确实进展，则世界仍无法免于战争之恐惧。”杜鲁门又宣称：“历史之过程已使美国成为世界烈强之一，所以我们负有特别的责任，以保存我们的实力，并在我们今日之世界中作适当的运用，他们将竭力担负此种责任。”
