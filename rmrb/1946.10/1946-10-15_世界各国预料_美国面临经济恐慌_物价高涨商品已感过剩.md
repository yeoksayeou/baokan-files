　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: The Associated Press, New York, 10th: Government figures from various countries generally believe that an economic recession in the United States is inevitable. Swedish Minister of Commerce, Mr. Myrdal, predicted before the end of the war that the United States might experience an economic crisis between six months and three years after peace. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton recently told an Associated Press reporter that an American recession would have a disastrous impact on peace plans. An Australian government spokesman has expressed concern about the possibility of a recession in the United States, which would lead to a reduction in American purchases of Australian raw materials. A recent economic analysis by the Bank of New York indicates that Canada and Sweden are unwilling to devalue their currencies against the US dollar to reduce the impact of an American recession on their economies. At the same time, there is much evidence that demand has begun to be met. Therefore, the economic activity resulting from demand accumulated during the war years will inevitably decrease. The high prices have made the American people unable or unwilling to purchase all the consumer goods they had originally planned to buy. Meanwhile, as of May of this year, 20 percent of workers had not received wage increases, and some of these workers are still demanding wage increases.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th: US News Agency, 8th: The US Department of Commerce announced that as of October 1, the US cotton harvest was 8,734,000, which is 4.91 percent less than the September estimate, the smallest cotton harvest since 1921.

　　世界各国预料
    美国面临经济恐慌
    物价高涨商品已感过剩
    【新华社延安十二日电】美联社纽约十日讯：世界各国政府人士，咸认美国经济不景气终将到来。瑞典商务部长穆尔达日在战争结束之前便已预言，美国或将于和平之后六个月至三年之间发生经济危机。英财相达尔顿近告美联社记者称：美国的不景气势必对和平计划发生灾难性之影响。澳洲政府发言人已提出担心美国有不景气之可能，且将因而使美国减少购买澳洲原料。纽约银行最近之经济分析，表示加拿大与瑞典不愿以其通货折合美元价值，以减少美国不景气对该两国经济之影响。同时，现有许多证据说明需求已开始满足，故因战时数年间积累下来的需求而发生的经济活动，必将从此减少，而物价之高涨，已使美国人民无力或不愿购买其原已计划购买之全部消费品。同时，至今年五月间，未增加工资者占百分之二十，这些工人有好些尚仍在要求增加工资。
    【新华社延安十二日电】美新闻处八日讯：美商务部宣称：截至十月一日止，美国棉花收成为八七三四○○○，已与九月估计比较少百分之四点九一，为一九二一年以来最少之棉花收成。
