Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. According to the Peiping Min Meng News published on the 6th, twenty-four people's organizations in Chongqing, including the "Chongqing People's Peace Promotion Association," recently issued a declaration in response to the "U.S. Troops Out of China" week. The declaration forcefully stated: The withdrawal of U.S. troops from China is important in terms of world peace, domestic unity and peace in China, and the interests of the American people. And "U.S. troops out of China" is even more important in terms of China's sovereignty and national self-esteem. The declaration pointed out that incidents of U.S. troops in China insulting women, shooting students, and killing people are endless. This is certainly not the glory of the United States, and the infringement of China's sovereignty and damage to national self-esteem are even more intolerable for patriots. The declaration concluded by stating: In order to obtain a peaceful, democratic, independent, and united China, and to realize world peace, U.S. troops must immediately withdraw from China, Chinese affairs must be handled by the Chinese themselves, sovereignty must be maintained, national self-esteem must be enhanced, and the Chinese and American people must unite to strive for world peace. The twenty-four people's organizations that signed the declaration were the Chongqing People's Peace Promotion Association, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic Constitutional Government Advancement Association, the Chongqing Branch of the All-China Association of Literary and Art Circles, the Sichuan Branch of the China Rural Economic Research Association, the Chongqing Branch of the China Economic Enterprise Advancement Association, the China Democratic Cultural and Educational Enterprise Advancement Association, the Sichuan Construction Advancement Association, the Chongqing Branch of the North China Political Construction Association, the Chongqing Branch of the Hubei Construction Advancement Association, the Peidu Youth Federation, the Chongqing Women's Federation, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic Lecture Society, the Democratic Youth Society, the Sichuan Women's Society, the Chongqing Branch of the China Vocational Youth Society, the Chinese Association of Poets and Musicians, the Chinese Association of Academic Workers, the Chongqing Branch of the September 3rd Society, the World Science Society, the China Rural Science Publishing House, the Chongqing Magazine Federation, the Social University Alumni Association, and the Chongqing Branch of the Life Education Society.

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 12th. According to the Peiping Democratic Weekly published on the 8th, six student groups, including Peiping United University, Yenching University, and Lin University, recently published a "Letter to the Political Action Committee of the American Peace Congress in response to the 'U.S. Troops Out of China' movement," which stated: Due to the civil war, traffic is blocked, factories are closed, land is barren, people are still dying and displaced, and they are being conscripted as laborers to bear excessive military expenses. We can no longer endure these disasters, because this is no longer an anti-Japanese war of aggression, but an endless self-killing and self-destruction. It continued: "The United States' 'mediation' of the KMT-CPC disputes over the past year has made the conflicts between the two parties increasingly difficult to resolve." Assistance to the government alone, such as the supply of munitions, the provision of arms, the transportation of troops, and the recent transfer of 850 million yuan of surplus materials, is sufficient to enhance the government's will for civil war and increasingly deviate from peaceful negotiations. The document rebuked the presence of U.S. troops in China and their atrocities as an invasion of Chinese sovereignty, and the various casualties caused by the U.S. military in China have made domestic peace negotiations even more chaotic and difficult. Therefore, it demanded that the United States withdraw its troops stationed in China and revise its China policy. The signatories to the letter were the Returned Students Association of the Former National Southwestern Associated University, the Self-Government Association of the Second Branch of the Peiping Temporary University Preparatory Class, the Spark Society of Yenching University, the Free Forum Society, the Yenching Life Society, and the Yenching Digest Society.

　　重庆二十四个人民团体宣言
    美军驻华侵犯中国主权
    北平六学生团体敦促美军立即撤退
    【新华社延安十二日电】据六日出版的北平民盟新闻载：重庆“渝市人民和平促进会”等二十四个人民团体，顷发表宣言响应“美军退出中国”周。宣言力称：美军退出中国，无论在世界和平的意义上，在中国国内团结和平的意义上或在美国人民的利益上说，均为重要。而“美军退出中国”，在中国主权完整、民族自尊的意义上说，更为重要。美军在华凌辱妇女，枪击学生，格杀人民之事层出不穷，此固非美国之光荣，而对于中国主权之侵犯、民族自尊心之损害，更为爱国主义者所不能忍受。宣言最后指出：为得到一个和平民主独立团结的中国，为实现世界和平，必须美军立即退出中国，中国的事中国人自己来处理，保持主权完整，提高民族自尊，中美人民联合争取世界和平。签名于该宣言的二十四人民团体为渝人民和平促进会、中国民主建国会渝分会、中国民主宪政促进会渝分会、中华全国文协渝分会、中国农村经济研究会四川分会、中国经济事业协进会渝分会、中国民主文化教育事业协进会、四川建设协进会、华北政治建设协会渝分会、湖北建设协进会渝分会、陪都青年联谊会、渝妇女联谊会、中国民主讲习社渝分社、民主青年社、四川妇女社、中国职业青年社渝分社、中国诗歌音乐工作者协会、中国学术工作者协会、九三学社渝分社、世界科学社、中国农村科学出版社、渝杂志联谊会、社会大学同学会、生活教育社渝分社。
    【新华社延安十二日电】据八日出版的北平民主周刊载：北平联大、燕大、临大等六学生团体，顷发表“为响应‘美军退出中国’运动致美国争取和平大会政治行动委员会书”，略称：由于内战以致交通阻塞，工厂倒闭，土地荒芜，人民仍然死亡流离，并被征为壮丁，担负着过大军费，这些灾祸，我们已经不能再忍受了，因为这已经不是对日的反侵略战争，而是无止境的自相残杀自相毁灭。继指出：“一年来美国对国共纷争‘调解’，反使两党的冲突日渐难解难分。”单独对政府的援助，如军火的接济，武装的配备，军队的运输，以及最近八亿五千万元的剩余物资的转让，适足以增强政府的内战意志，而与和平谈判日益背道而驰。该件斥责美军驻华及其暴行，乃侵略中国主权，而美军因在华所引起的各次伤亡事件，均使中国国内和平谈判更加混乱和困难，因此要求美国撤退驻华美军及修正对华政策。在该书上签署者为国立西南联大复员学生抵平同学会、北平临时大学补习班第二分班自治会、燕京大学星火社、自由论坛社、燕京生活社、燕京文摘社。
