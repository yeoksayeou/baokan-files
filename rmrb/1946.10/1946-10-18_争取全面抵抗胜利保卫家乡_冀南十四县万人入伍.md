　　Strive for Complete Victory in Resistance and Defend Our Homeland
    Ten Thousand People Enlist in Fourteen Counties of Southern Hebei
    [This newspaper's Weixian dispatch, 15th] With Chiang Kai-shek effectively announcing a complete break, the broad masses of liberated people in Southern Hebei, under the slogan of "Total Resistance" and "Defend the Land," have once again set off a fervent wave of joining the army. In Yongzhi, Linqing, and fourteen other counties alone, ten thousand young people have surged into the Eighth Route Army. In Dazhai Village, Sixth District of Nangong, twenty-five young people enlisted from just over two hundred households. In Yangqiu Village, with one hundred and twenty households, the number of young people enlisting reached twenty-three, exceeding expectations by five to six times. In the Lin(qing)-Xi area, the young people who enlisted have already been formed into a battalion and are still constantly increasing in number. According to those familiar with the situation in Southern Hebei: The enthusiasm of the masses for joining the army this time is unprecedented since the War of Resistance, which is the result of realizing "land to the tiller" and a high degree of hatred for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Li Haishui, a hired worker from Sujiazhuang, First District of Nangong, patted his chest and said: "I worked for eight years and didn't save a penny. This time, thanks to our Communist Party and Chairman Mao leading us to turn over, I got five mu of land, and now I can stand up and speak! That thieving Chiang wants to take away our rice bowl, I will fight him to the death!" He invited two partners to enlist in the army together. An old man who had been allocated twenty mu of land during the mass movement, decided to mobilize his second son to join the army. His second son felt that his elder brother had joined the Eighth Route Army for many years and had not returned, and he was worried that his old father would not have anyone to take care of him, so he hesitated for a while. The old man was furious and said: "You've only had two days of full meals and you've forgotten the Eighth Route Army? If Chiang comes, do you think you'll still be able to eat your fill?" The second son said: "I hate Chiang Kai-shek to the bone, don't worry about me, Dad, I'll go." At the enlistment meeting in Diao Zhuang Village, Linqing, the director of the Women's Federation volunteered to mobilize her husband to join the army, which made her husband exclaim: "I still need you to mobilize me? I already signed up!" The old village chief of Zhongguanying Village, Weixian County, said to his son: "Baoyin, I'll take care of the things at home. If you don't defeat Chiang and you desert, I won't recognize you as my son!" Wang Baoyin said: "Dad, don't worry!" After saying that, he quickly caught up with his companions and went to report to a certain unit of the Eighth Route Army in high spirits.

　　争取全面抵抗胜利保卫家乡
    冀南十四县万人入伍
    【本报威县十五日电】蒋介石实际已宣告全面破裂，冀南广大翻身群众，在“全面抵抗”、“保卫土地”的口号下，又一次掀起热火朝天的参军浪潮。仅永智、临清等十四个县，已有一万青年涌进八路军。南宫六区的大砦村，一满二百户即有二十五个青年参军，杨邱村一百二十户，参军青年达二十三人，超过预料五倍至六倍。临（清）西一地参军的青年已编就一个营，仍不断激增着。据熟悉冀南情况者谈：这次群众参军热情之高为抗战以来所未有，这是由于实现耕者有其田及对卖国贼蒋介石高度仇恨的结果。南宫一区苏家庄雇工李海水，拍一拍胸膛说：“我扛八年活，一个钱没剩下，这回亏得咱共产党毛主席领着翻了身，俺分得五亩地，说话也能站个地方啦！老蒋这贼臊的要来端咱饭碗，俺非跟他拚个死活不行！”他邀了两个伙伴，一起报名参军。一老人在群运中分得土地二十亩，决心动员他二儿参军，他二儿子觉得大哥参加八路军抗日多年未回，怕老父没人照管，一时犹疑未决。老人大发雷霆说：“你吃了两天饱饭就把八路军忘啦，老蒋来了，你看还能吃饱饭？”二儿说：“我恨老蒋早恨透了，爸爸在家不愁我就去了。”临清刁庄村参军大会上，妇救会主任自报奋勇，要动员丈夫参军，急得她丈夫嚷道：“我还要你动员，我早就报名了！”威县中官营村老村长对他儿子说：“保银，家里事情有我来照管，不把老蒋打败，你要开小差回来了，我就要不认你作儿了！”王保银说：“爹，你尽管放心吧！”说罢，便快步赶上他的伙伴们，雄赳赳的到了八路军×部报到。
