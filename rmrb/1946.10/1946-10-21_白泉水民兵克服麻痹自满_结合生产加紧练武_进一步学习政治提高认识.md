　　Baiquanshui Militia Overcomes Complacency and Slackness
　　Intensifies Military Training Combined with Production
　　Further Studies Politics and Improves Understanding
　　[Report from Shexian by our newspaper] Under the call to strengthen the patriotic self-defense war, the militia of Baiquanshui Village in the Second District of Shexian County has overcome complacency and slackness, and has once again set off a warm military training movement. Before the counter-offensive, the village was a model village and had won first prizes many times. But since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they thought, "It's peaceful now, what's the use of training soldiers?!" The leaders also said, "What are we afraid of? Can the 'model' run away from us?" So they all stopped working on it. During the county-wide militia review in July, the village not only did not have any new martial arts skills, but even forgot all the old ones. At the review meeting, everyone realized: "If we don't hurry up and practice, we will suffer when the reactionaries come!" It was immediately decided to combine production and intensify military training. The regulations were: (1) Cadres must take the lead, (2) A test will be conducted every ten days to assess the results. Good ones will be commended, and bad ones will be educated. The enthusiasm for military training immediately recovered and surged. Everyone practiced for two hours every night, and also practiced during the midday break. When they couldn't see the target at night, they used a burning rope as a target. During live ammunition shooting, in order to save bullets, they used local guns to shoot self-made black powder and sand. The number of people participating in military training has now surged from 40 to more than 80, and everyone has learned many combat techniques: a three-jin hand grenade can be thrown 25 meters and hit the target. Standing, prone, and upward shooting, as well as bayonet practice, have also greatly improved. At present, the village is not only further practicing martial arts, but also partially shifting to political study, preparing to further improve ideologically and politically, and be ready to participate in the patriotic self-defense war at any time.

　　白泉水民兵克服麻痹自满
    结合生产加紧练武
    进一步学习政治提高认识
    【本报涉县讯】在加强爱国自卫战争的号召下，涉县二区白泉水村民兵克服自满与麻痹，重新掀起热烈的习武运动。该村在反攻前是模范村，曾得过多次头等奖。但自抗战胜利后，认为“和平了，练兵还有啥用！？”领导上也说：“怕啥，‘模范’还能从咱手里跑掉？”于是都不干了。七月间全县民兵检阅时，该村不但没有新的武艺，连旧的也全忘掉了。在检讨会上，大家才警觉起来说：“如果不赶快练习，反动派来了会吃亏的！”当即决定结合生产，加紧练武。规定：（一）干部要带头，（二）十天测验一次成绩。好的表扬，坏的教育。习武情绪立即恢复并高涨起来，大家每晚练两个钟头，白天歇晌也练；晚上看不见瞄准，就用火绳当目标；实弹射击时，为了爱惜子弹，就用土枪打自造的黑药和砂子。参加习武的现已由四十人激增至八十多人，大家都学会了许多作战技术：三斤重的手榴弹能投二十五米达，并命中目标。立射卧射仰射及刺枪等，也已大有进步。目前该村正一方面进一步习武，一方面部分的转入学习政治，准备从思想上、政治上更加提高，随时准备参加到爱国自卫战争中去。（张中央）。
