　　[Report from the Front Lines of Ji-Lu-Yu on the 16th] Our correspondent's comprehensive report on the battle situation on the Heze front over the past half-month states: Chiang Kai-shek's elite fully American-equipped Fifth Army and Chen Cheng's direct line 11th Division (formerly the 18th Army) advanced westward along the He(ze)-Ju(ye) highway. As of now, we have killed or wounded 5,000 enemy soldiers, and the fleeing remnants of the Fifth Army are currently trapped in our encirclement. In the Battle of Long＠ji, our army created an example of enemy-to-own casualties of sixty to one. Since the 28th of last month, Chiang's Fifth Army, with 20,000 soldiers, fiercely attacked our Long＠ji. Under the cover of airplanes and artillery, they launched repeated assaults dozens of times, concentrating all their American-made artillery shells, totaling 20,000 rounds. Qiu Qingquan, the army commander, had previously declared to his troops: "Regardless of any sacrifice, we must take Long＠ji!" However, our army calmly responded and fought fiercely for four days and nights, turning Long＠ji into a graveyard for the invading army, killing and wounding more than 3,000 of Chiang's soldiers, while we only suffered more than 50 casualties. On the evening of the 8th, the enemy, unable to withstand the attacks, retreated southward, and our army pursued victoriously. In the Xiaozhangzhuang area south of Long＠ji, the remaining enemy fled towards the south bank of the Zhu River. Another powerful unit of our army has advanced to the Ding(tao)-Ju(ye) highway on the south bank of the Zhu River, cutting off their rear supply line, and the remaining enemy is currently trapped in our encirclement. Zhang Fengji, the location of the 11th Brigade headquarters of the right-wing 11th Division, also suffered our strong counterattack on the 5th. The 32nd Regiment was completely annihilated by us, and another regiment that came to reinforce was also defeated by us. In the Battle of Zhang Fengji, we killed and wounded another 2,000 of Chiang's soldiers and captured 700. The total results of the above two battles are still being verified. According to preliminary statistics, a total of two cars, four American-made mountain guns, four rocket launchers, six anti-tank guns, seventeen heavy machine guns, seventy-four light machine guns, more than a thousand rifles, two hundred 6cm caliber small artillery shells, and more than two hundred thousand rounds of rifle bullets were captured.
