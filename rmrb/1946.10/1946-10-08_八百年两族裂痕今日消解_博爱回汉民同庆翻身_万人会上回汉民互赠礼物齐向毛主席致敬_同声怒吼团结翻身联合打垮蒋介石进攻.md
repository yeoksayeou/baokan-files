(From Our Correspondent in Changzhi, 3rd) After the victory of the joint Hui and Han people in Bo'ai in the struggle to settle accounts with the blood debts of the traitors Da Hui Han Shan Wenzhang and Bai Ziming (details in today's communication on this page), a ten thousand person celebration meeting was held in Daxinzhuang. Above the entrance to the venue hung a large plaque reading "Celebrating the Unity and Emancipation of Hui and Han People." A giant portrait of Chairman Mao hung on the rostrum, in front of which was a banner that read: "In the past, the mutual slaughter between Hui and Han was caused by Chiang Kai-shek; today, the unity and emancipation of Hui and Han are led by Chairman Mao." Couplets and slogans in Hui and Han languages, such as "Support Chairman Mao's policy of ethnic equality, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's Han chauvinism," were particularly eye-catching. The Hui people, carrying flags that said "Great Unity of Hui and Han," and beating drums and gongs, warmly welcomed the Han people from various villages who came to participate. The flags of the Han people of Qidian read: "Qidian (Han village) and Daxinzhuang (Hui village) will be friends forever." At the meeting, the Hui and Han people paid their respects to Chairman Mao together, and representatives of both sides exchanged gifts such as chicks, eggs, and fried dough twists. Hui and Han music was played together, and the whole venue was filled with earth-shattering cheers. Zhang Zhima, a representative of the Hui people from Daxinzhuang, jumped onto the stage and said: "Today is a great day of joy! The eight hundred year knot between the Hui and Han people has been untied! In the past, people from the east village couldn't go to the west village, and even a friendly word couldn't be spoken; now we have united to overthrow the great Hui traitors, and smashed the stone tablets they erected to divide us; under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we have become one family; isn't this a great happy event!" The crowd was quiet, smiling from ear to ear. Then he said forcefully: "We have been emancipated through unity, and we must also unite to defeat the offensive of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek!" Ten thousand fists and gun barrels were raised high, roaring: "Celebrate the unity of the Hui and Han people, oppose Chiang Kai-shek's civil war!" Ma Zhi, the Ahong of the East Great Mosque, proposed that the water channel used by the Hui people for ablutions before prayer be diverted so that it no longer flows into the channel used by the Han people for drinking water. The masses responded to this proposal with enthusiastic cheers. The song "No distinction between Hui and Han, close as brothers" floated from the entire venue, resounding through the clouds. After the meeting, various Yangko dances and folk performances began at the same time, and the Hui and Han people enjoyed themselves together. The small ditch separating the Hui and Han villages next to the venue was almost flattened by them.
