Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 14th: The Tianjin Dagongbao's Beijing dispatch on the 12th revealed that the Chiang government arbitrarily sells national secrets, "allowing various American personnel to actively collect various materials and intelligence, especially in the military field." The article stated: "Any American advisor, any American official, can freely collect Chinese data." "Only American advisors and American dignitaries can have a comprehensive view of the overall situation and collect every relevant piece of information." The article also revealed that the United States is using Chinese bodies to test weapons, claiming that: "No army in the world using American equipment for combat can surpass the Chinese; therefore, American officers pay close attention to the performance of their various weapons when used in China. In addition to what is publicly published in general newspapers and magazines, they also conduct investigations in various ways."

Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 13th: Shanghai News: Chiang Kai-shek sells national harbors in exchange for American surplus materials. According to a report in the American magazine "World Report" reprinted by the Shanghai News on September 22nd: "China has allowed American warships to be repaired in Chinese coastal docks for 30 years in order to obtain the right to purchase over 800 million yuan of American military surplus materials." Previously, the English magazine "News Letter" in Shanghai first reported on September 28th that the sale of American surplus materials to China was accompanied by a secret 30-year dock agreement. According to this agreement, American warships can freely enter and use all Chinese harbors within 30 years. The Shanghai public is extremely indignant about this and demands that the Kuomintang authorities publicly deny this news, but the authorities have remained silent. People here point out that Chiang Kai-shek's large-scale sale of Chinese harbors is unprecedented in Chinese history.

　　蒋介石卖国狂
    听任美方人员搜集情报出卖海港换取剩余物资
    【新华社延安十四日电】十二日天津大公报北平通讯，透露蒋政府任意出卖国家秘密，“听任美方各种人员积极搜集各种资料及情报，特别是军事方面者”。该文称：“任何一个美国顾问，任何一个美国官方人士，都可以随意搜集中国的资料”。“只有美国顾问和美国贵宾可以总观全局，把每一分有关资料都收集在手里”。该文又透露了美国正以中国人肉体供其试验武器，据称：“全世界使用美械作战之军队，无能超过中国者；故美国军官对于其各种武器在中国使用时之性能，极为注意。除一般报纸杂志公开发表者外，并以种种不同方法进行调查。”
    【新华社延安十三日电】沪讯：蒋介石出卖全国海港，以换取美国剩余物资。据九月二十二日沪报转载美国杂志“世界报”报导之消息称：“中国为了获得购买八亿余元美军剩余物资的权利，已允许美军舰在三十年内可在中国沿海船坞中修理。以前此间英文杂文杂志“新闻通讯”曾于九月二十八日首先传出美国剩余物资售华附有密约卅年船坞协定，依此协定，卅年内中国所有的海港美军舰，皆可自由出入使用。沪市舆论界对此极为愤慨，要求国民党当局公开否认这一消息，但当局始终默不作声。此间人士指出：蒋介石如此大规模的出卖中国海港，在中国历史上还没有前例。
