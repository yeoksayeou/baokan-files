Xinhua News Agency, Xuanhua, 3rd. Simultaneous with the resolute resistance to Chiang's troops' attack on Zhangjiakou, another massive military conspiracy organization dispatched by Chiang Kai-shek to create riots in the Chahar liberated areas was cracked by the Xuanhua public security organs yesterday. This is another great victory following the cracking of the KMT agent Liu Jianxun case in Zhangjiakou and the consolidation of the rear of the liberated areas. The principal culprit, Liu Xiuyan, deputy commander of the Chahar Provincial Security under the direct jurisdiction of the 12th War Zone of the Kuomintang, along with his adjutant Wang Ying, ordnance officer Lin Mingchen, detachment leader Yang Manqi, and others have all been arrested. None of the so-called "underground army" henchmen lurking in various places awaiting an opportunity to act has escaped. The Chahar Provincial Court is now conducting separate trials, and the truth of the case will be announced soon.
