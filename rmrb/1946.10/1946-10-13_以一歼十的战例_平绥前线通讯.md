　　A Victory of Destroying Ten Enemies with One
    ——A Dispatch from the Ping-Sui Front
    In the trenches east of Huai Rou City, the reporter met the eleven combat heroes of the famous Yan Yaoqing squad of a certain Eighth Route Army brigade from the Kang Zhuang battle. They were busy arranging new combat fortifications. Many slogans were posted on the machine gun emplacements, the most striking of which was: "Comrades, aim well before you shoot!" The soldiers jokingly introduced their squad leader, "Little Yan," to the reporter. He was just a handsome 22-year-old soldier who had reportedly carried a "Type 38" rifle for seven or eight years. They modestly attributed their glorious combat achievements to the decline of the Kuomintang army's morale.

    According to the battle account the reporter heard from the command, at dawn on September 30th, a battalion of the Kuomintang army's Sixteenth Army, under the cover of fierce artillery fire, launched an attack on a small hilltop south of Kang Zhuang, which was guarded by Yan Yaoqing's squad. The average rate of artillery shells increased from eight to twelve per minute. The ridge, only thirty steps wide, was almost leveled. The dry yellow grass on the slope was engulfed in flames. These eleven exceptionally brave people's fighters calmly crouched under the thick mud churned up by the shells, intently waiting for the clumsy Kuomintang soldiers to climb the hilltop. They repelled the Kuomintang soldiers seven times with machine guns and hand grenades, leaving more than a hundred Kuomintang corpses strewn across the hillside. For more than eight hours, Yan Yaoqing's squad lay prone in the smoke and fire, their ears deafened by the explosions, yet they resolutely waved to each other, signaling their determination to defend the position entrusted to them by the people. Finally, upon receiving a strong order from the command, the whole squad reluctantly withdrew from the battle, covered in gunpowder. Only two of the eleven were slightly injured by shrapnel, creating a brilliant example of destroying ten enemies with one.

    Now, these loyal people's heroes only humorously discuss the various cowardly and ugly behaviors of the Kuomintang army on the battlefield, rarely mentioning their own combat achievements. They summarize the "offensive spirit" of the Kuomintang army in three vivid phrases: before the battle, "rely on artillery fire"; during the charge, "pretend to be tough," afraid to advance alone, simply driven by the supervisory team, rushing forward in groups without regard for their lives; during the retreat, "use people as filler" (abandoning the corpses of soldiers, filling the front of our positions). Yan Yaoqing said with a smile that even when the fighting was fierce on the front lines, the hearty laughter of his "comrades" was always constant, and they always liked to tell "jokes." For example, when the Kuomintang army suffered a heavy blow, they would always yell乱, "Mommy! Mommy! I can't go forward!" A soldier would stick his head out of the fortifications and shout in a comical, tearful voice: "Platoon leader, go tell the company commander: 'Mommy, I can't go forward!' The company commander says, 'Mommy, go find the battalion commander!' The battalion commander is hiding in the tank."

    This caused the whole squad to burst into laughter in the trenches. After a while, the whole squad recalled the scene at the time, and they all laughed again. The reporter could not help but be deeply moved by the ever-burning and optimistic fighting spirit of these young warriors.

　　以一歼十的战例
    ——平绥前线通讯
    记者在怀柔城东的战壕里会见了康庄战斗中八路军某旅著名的阎耀青班十一个战斗英雄，他们正忙着布置新的战斗工事，机枪掩体上花花绿绿贴了许多标语，最触目的一条是：“同志们，瞄准好了再打！”战士们笑闹着把他们的班长“小阎”介绍给记者，这还只是一个二十二岁的英俊战士，据说已经扛了七八年“三八”式了；他们谦逊地把自己创造的光辉战斗成绩都归于蒋军士气的颓败。
    据记者从指挥部听到的战斗经过是这样的：九月三十日拂晓，蒋军十六军一营兵力，借着凶猛的炮火掩护，向阎耀青一班人扼守的康庄南面一座小山头进攻了，炮弹每分钟平均速率由八发增到十二发，方圆三十步宽的山岭，几乎都被轰平了，坡上的枯黄野草都卷起熊熊的火舌；这十一个英勇绝伦的人民战士，只是镇静的蜷伏在炮弹掀起的厚厚泥土下，聚精会神的等待着拙笨的蒋军爬上山头，他们连续七次用机枪和手榴弹把冲到跟前的蒋军驱下山去，一百多具蒋军的死尸横陈在山坡上，阎耀青班一连八个多钟头伏身在炮火烟硝中，每人耳朵都被震聋了，仍相互坚决的挥着手，示意要保卫这块人民付托给的阵地，最后接到了指挥部的强令，全班人才恋恋不舍的带着满身火药气撤出了战斗。十一个人中只有两名是被炮弹破片擦伤的，创造了以一歼十的光辉战例。
    现在这群忠诚的人民英雄们，只是诙谐的谈论着蒋军在战场上种种懦怯的丑态，很少提到本身的战斗事绩，他们用三句生动的话来概括蒋军的“攻击精神”，那就是战斗前“仗炮火”，冲锋时“装疙疸”，不敢单独踊进，只是被督战队驱赶着，成群结队没命的窜，临退却“使人填”（遗弃士兵死尸不管，把我方阵地前沿都填满了）。阎耀青笑着说，就在火线上战斗激烈的时候，他的“伙计”们爽朗的笑声也总是不断的，老爱说“俏皮话”。譬如蒋军在遭了痛击时总爱“妈呀！妈呀！不能前进了”乱嚷，一个战士就从工事里伸出头去，滑稽的装着哭腔喊道：“排长找连长去说：‘妈呀，不能前进了。’连长说‘妈呀，去找营长！’营长可正躲在坦克车上呢。”
    逗得全班人在战壕里都哄笑起来了。一会，全班人忆起当时的情景，又都哈哈大笑起来。记者不禁深深为这年青勇士们永远炽旺乐观的战斗情绪感动。
