　　International Week
    In the past week, the international event of greatest concern to us Chinese people has been the Far Eastern Conference in San Francisco. This conference, initiated by the "American National Committee for Peace" and the "Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy," representing more than 15 million American people, was specifically to review the U.S. authorities' policies in the Far East, particularly in China. During the three days of discussion from the 18th to the 20th, the participating representatives unanimously advocated that the U.S. authorities should withdraw American troops stationed in China and stop providing military and financial assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek government. This is undoubtedly a strong support for our Chinese people's struggle against the civil war and against American aid to Chiang.
    Democratic forces in the United States are gradually moving towards organized unity. The "Chicago Progressives Liaison," including seventeen progressive groups, was established at the beginning of this month to work together to restore Roosevelt's policies. The issue of U.S. troop presence in China will also be discussed at the current UN General Assembly. This major international conference opened in New York on the 23rd. In another ten days, there will be another important meeting, namely the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to finalize the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland, which will also be held there. It goes without saying that these two major parallel conferences are major events in the international situation in the next month or two. On the 24th, the Liberation Daily published an editorial outlining the Chinese people's hopes for the UN General Assembly.
    On the eve of these two major conferences, U.S. representatives Byrnes and Vandenberg, Soviet representative Molotov, and British representatives Bevin and Attlee, successively delivered speeches and statements. Molotov believed that "as long as everyone has goodwill and a genuine desire to understand each other," the two major conferences can be successfully concluded. Bevin also said that "the whole world must seek new solutions on a broad basis." Even Byrnes did not talk about a "tough policy towards the Soviet Union," but said that he "will continue to seek friendship with the Soviet Union." However, Byrnes' speech was still vague, such as "the veto power should not be exercised arbitrarily," "we must retain our own views," etc. Therefore, many newspapers believe that Byrnes' so-called "seeking friendship with the Soviet Union" is to appease the dissatisfaction of the broad masses of people, ease the divisions within the Democratic Party, and seize the opportunity of the upcoming election. From this perspective, there will inevitably be fierce debates in the two major conferences. Upon arriving in New York, Molotov stated that the Soviet Union "will continue to work for the consolidation of peace and the welfare of all countries, large and small, in order to strive for the successful conclusion of the UN General Assembly and the Foreign Ministers' Conference."
    In the past week, the domestic affairs of the United States and the Soviet Union have also attracted attention. In the United States, due to the lifting of price controls on many important items, prices have soared, and people's lives have become increasingly difficult. A new large-scale wave of strikes is about to break out. In contrast, the Soviet Union is focusing on domestic construction. The Supreme Soviet recently approved the budget, greatly reducing military spending, and investing huge sums of up to 95 billion rubles in economic construction to actively promote the new Five-Year Plan.

　　国际一周
    过去一周中，国际上最为我们中国人民关切的事件，是在旧金山召开的中国远东会议。这个会议由代表一千五百万以上的美国人民的“美国全国争取和平委员会”及“民主远东政策委员会”发起，专为检讨美国当局在远东特别是在中国的政策。在十八日至二十日的三天讨论中，与会代表一致主张美国当局应撤退驻华美军，停止在军事上和财政上援助蒋介石政府。这对于我们中国人民的反对内战反对美国援蒋的斗争，无疑是一个有力支援。
    美国民主力量目前正逐渐走上有组织的团结，包括十七进步团体的“芝加哥进步份子联系会”已于本月初成立，协力为恢复罗斯福的政策而奋斗。关于美军驻华问题，亦将在本届联合国大会上讨论。这一个重大的国际会议，已于二十三日在纽约开幕，再过旬日还有一个重要会议，即最后制订对意、罗、保、匈、芬、五国和约的四强外长会议，亦将在该地举行。这两大平行的会议，不用说是今后一两个月内国际局势中的重大事件。二十四日解放日报发表社论，提出中国人民对联合国大会的希望。
    在这两大会议前夕，美国的贝纳斯和范登堡，苏联的莫洛托夫，英国的贝文和艾德礼，相继发表了演说和声明。莫洛托夫认为“只要大家善意和真正愿望互相谅解”，两大会议即可胜利结束。贝文也说“全世界必须在广泛的基础上觅取新的解决方案”，甚至贝纳斯也不谈“对苏强硬政策”，而说“将继续觅取对苏友谊”；但是贝纳斯演说依然含糊其词如“不应专断行使否决权”，“我们必须保留自己的观点”等等，故许多报纸认为贝纳斯所谓“觅取对苏友谊”云云，为的是搪塞广大人民的不满，缓和民主党内的分歧，投即将来临的大选之机。由是观之，两大会议中势必有剧烈的争论。莫洛托夫抵达纽约时，表示苏联“将为巩固的和平与大小国家的福利而继续努力，以争取联合国大会及外长会议的胜利结束”。
    过去一周中，美苏两国内政亦引人注意，美国由于许多重要项目物价的管制之取消百物飞涨，人民生活骤趋艰难，新的大规模罢工浪潮又势将爆发；反观苏联，正埋头国内建设，日前最高苏维埃已通过预算，大大裁减军费，而在经济建设方面投入巨资达九百五十亿卢布，积极推进新五年计划。
