Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st—The Sichuan Province people's uprising forces are growing daily and have now expanded to eighty-four counties. In addition to the previously reported seventy-four counties, according to recent reports from Chongqing and Chengdu newspapers, armed uprisings have also been discovered in the following ten counties: Wuba, Chengkou, and Biba in eastern Sichuan; Beichuan, Songpan, Pingwu, and Zhangming in northern Sichuan; Tongchuan and Pengxi in central Sichuan; and Jingyan in western Sichuan. The momentum is strongest in northern Sichuan. Li Lejie's unit, the leader of the Beichuan county uprising, with more than 1,000 people, is active in Qingchuan town and the Beichuan county seat area between Zhaohua and Pingwu. Another unit of more than 1,000 people is active on the road from Songpan to Beichuan, frequently ambushing Chiang's troops. The armed uprising forces north of Beichuan, numbering more than 2,000, are advancing on Jiangyou and Zhangming counties, more than 200 li northeast of Chengdu. It is reported that one unit has advanced to 30 li from Jiangyou city, shaking the entire city. Many families of Kuomintang officials and wealthy households have fled to the countryside. According to villagers in Pingwu, Xiaohe, and Guixi towns, more than 1,000 armed uprising members recently repelled the Kuomintang local defense teams in Guixi town and Pingtong township and pursued them to near the Doukou Temple at the foot of Dayin Mountain. The uprisings in Wushan, Wuxi, and Chengkou areas in eastern Sichuan are fierce, and an increasing number of poor peasants are participating. Due to their weak strength, the Kuomintang local defense teams can only hold the county seats. On the southern Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou border, more than 100 armed men led by Yin, Liu Cai, and Wang Liancheng have emerged, and they frequently fight with Chiang's troops to seize weapons and arm themselves. Another unit led by Chen Zhanyun, with dozens of people, carrying machine guns and rifles, operates in the mountainous areas of Jiangjin and Qijiang. Armed uprisings are also fierce near Jingyan county seat, 200 li south of Chengdu in western Sichuan. Rumors of armed personnel sneaking into Meishan have spread within the city, and the entire city has tightened security. Recently, Wang Hongjun, a staff officer of the Chongqing Garrison Headquarters, after inspecting with Sun Yuanliang, admitted that "today's bandits are all good citizens forced by life."

　　四川民变继续扩大
    川北人民武装进迫江油彰明
    【新华社延安二十一日电】川省民变武装日益发展，现已扩展至八十四县。除前已报导之七十四县外，近据渝蓉各报透露，川东之巫巴、城口、壁巴、川北之北川，松潘、平武、彰明，川中之潼川、蓬溪及川西之井研等十县亦发现民变武装，其中以川北声势最大。北川县民变的首领李乐截部共一千余人，活跃于昭化平武间之青川镇及北川县城一带，另一部千余人活动于松潘至北川道上，经常伏击蒋军。北川以北之民变武装二千余，正向成都东北二百余里之江油、彰明两县迫近，闻一部已进抵距江油城卅里处，震撼全城，国民党官员及富户之家眷已多逃至乡下。另据平武、小河、桂溪镇之乡民谈：民变武装千余人，近将桂溪镇及平通乡之国民党团队击退，并追击至大印山下之豆蔻寺附近。川东之巫山、巫溪及城口一带民变甚炽，一般贫苦农民参加者日众，国民党团队因力量薄弱，只有孤守县城。川南川滇黔边又产生有阴、六才、汪连成率领之百余武装，近日常与蒋军作战，夺取枪械武装自己。另有陈占云部数十人，携机枪及长短步枪出没江津綦江一带山地。川西距成都以南二百里之井研县城附近武装民变亦炽，城内并传闻眉山潜入武装人员，全城加紧戒严。最近重庆警备部参谋王洪俊随孙元良视察结果，承认“今日之匪，均为生活所迫之良民。”
