　　Our Army in Northern Henan Launches Fierce Counterattack
    Recaptures Seven Chiang Kai-shek/Puppet Strongholds
    Killing, Wounding and Capturing Over 400 Chiang Kai-shek Soldiers Including a Deputy Brigade Commander
    [Our Newspaper, Handan, 9th] Our army along the Pinghan Railway in Northern Henan launched a counterattack, recapturing five Chiang Kai-shek/puppet strongholds in two days, wounding Chiang Kai-shek's Deputy Brigade Commander Feng Shutang and killing, wounding and capturing over 300 Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers. On the 5th and 6th of this month, our local guerrilla corps went into action, launching counterattacks against Chiang Kai-shek/puppet strongholds such as Xixiahan, Wu Wang, Zhaizi, Yuan Taibao in Anyang, and Gongshan five miles east of Huixian County. After fierce fighting, all the above strongholds were recovered by us. We killed, wounded, and captured Cui Yanshan, the Chiang Kai-shek/puppet company commander, and more than 220 members of the special agent armed "Homecoming Corps," and seized one light machine gun and more than 30 long and short guns. On the same day, the two battalions (1st and 3rd) of the 217th Regiment of the 39th Brigade of the 40th Division of the Chiang Kai-shek army, along with the brigade artillery company and the 1st Regiment of the Security Forces, totaling more than 1,000 men, who were advancing into the area west of Qugou, were also routed by our forces, killing and wounding more than 80 people including Deputy Brigade Commander Feng Shutang.

    [Our Newspaper, Anyang Front, 10th] Our Northern Anyang troops continued to expand their offensive, capturing the Chiang Kai-shek/puppet strongholds of Chenjiajing and Donghan on the night of the 8th. The entire Anyang Security Brigade of Chiang Kai-shek/puppets was annihilated, with more than 130 Chiang Kai-shek/puppets killed, wounded and captured. More than 30 rifles were seized. The Chiang Kai-shek/puppet stronghold in Chezhuang, upon hearing the intense artillery fire that night, fled in terror. (Note: Chenjiajing is north of Qugou, one li away from Qugou. After this stronghold was occupied by our army, Qugou was directly threatened by our army.) On the same night, the militia of the Ninth District of Anyang automatically cooperated in the attack, and in one night recovered all the electric wires stretching seven or eight li from Weijiaying to Qilidian Mao Yi Jian.
