　　[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper Correspondent in Shuiye, 30th] Just as the Central News Agency clamored about "fierce battles with the Communist army in the Shuiye area of Anyang," our troops stationed in Shuiye Town, in coordination with the militia, removed the important stronghold of Chiang Kai-shek's puppet army in Yongding Village, 20 li east of Shuiye, on the night of the 29th, and completely annihilated the 11th Company of the 3rd Security Regiment of the Kuomintang Henan Third Special Commissioner's Office and the special agent armed "Returning Home Corps" occupying the area. It is estimated that 50 Chiang Kai-shek special agents were killed or wounded, more than 30 were captured alive, more than 30 long and short guns and two livestock were seized. The remaining machine guns and other weapons were buried with some of the Chiang Kai-shek puppet troops in the destroyed bunkers.
