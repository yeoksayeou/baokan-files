　　Yangyi Masses Defend Their Homes
    Voluntarily Raise Funds to Buy Weapons
    [Our Newspaper News] The masses in Yangyi, the seventh district of Wu'an, donated more than 1.75 million yuan to purchase weapons to defend their good times, and also donated 100,000 yuan to buy cotton clothes to relieve refugees fleeing from the Chiang-occupied areas. After news came of the Kuomintang army's invasion of our liberated areas of Zhangjiakou and Jiaozuo, the entire population of Yangyi Township held meetings on the 16th to discuss the current situation. At the meetings, they unanimously demanded the expansion of armed forces to preserve the hard-won good times. Rich peasant Guo Qingyi said, "Since the Anti-Japanese War, my life has been much better than it was under the Kuomintang rule. I propose donating money to buy weapons for our village and resolutely defeat Chiang Kai-shek. I cannot go to the front line, so I will donate 50,000 yuan." Military dependent Shen Yan said, "Although my son is fighting Chiang Kai-shek on the front line, I will also donate 30,000 yuan to buy weapons." The manager of Yongji Store said, "Fighting Chiang Kai-shek is everyone's business, and I must do my part. I will donate 20,000 yuan." The emancipated households, hero models, and street cadres all voluntarily donated money. Newly emancipated Li Erkui said, "Now Chiang Kai-shek is colluding with the United States to make trouble. Defending the good times is our own business. I will donate the 1,000 yuan I earned from odd jobs (doing small business)." Meng Fuying, director of the North Street Armed Committee, said, "I previously thought that peace had come and that armed forces were useless. Now I know that we must use armed force against Chiang Kai-shek. In the future, I will definitely improve our armed forces. In addition, I will also donate 2,000 yuan." After two or three days, the entire village donated a total of 1,753,750 yuan. At a village meeting, it was also decided to allocate 100,000 yuan to make cotton clothes for the refugees fleeing from the areas invaded by Chiang's army.
