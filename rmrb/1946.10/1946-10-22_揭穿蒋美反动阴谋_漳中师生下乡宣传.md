Expose Chiang and American Reactionary Conspiracy
Zhangzhong Teachers and Students Go to the Countryside for Propaganda
[Our Magnetic County Dispatch] Inspired by a high degree of patriotic enthusiasm, all 300-plus teachers and students of Zhangbin Middle School in Magnetic County formed three powerful propaganda teams and suspended classes on the 5th of this month to go to the countryside. The three teams mobilized the masses to rise up and comprehensively resist Chiang and the United States. They were divided into various groups, such as drama, slogans, newspaper reading, women, children, mass blackboard, and broadcasting station, to work in various villages and towns around Laoyayu, Linshui, Pengcheng, and other areas. Wherever they went, they performed their own original current affairs propaganda dramas for the masses, who warmly welcomed them. After performing "Chiang and American Collaboration," "Civil Unrest in the Great Rear," and "Rise Up and Defend the Liberated Areas" in Laoyayu, local cadres and the masses firmly requested continued performances. When performing "Fleeing from Disaster" and "Life in the Liberated Areas" in Pengcheng, the masses said, "What the play tells us is more than what we learn in meetings." The masses in various places gave them vegetables and other items as gifts. The masses in Nancheng Village sent 50 jin of mutton to the students of the third team. Many of the students were from rural areas, and they helped the villagers sweep the yards, hold babies, carry water, and even harvest crops. At the same time, they read newspapers to the masses, talked about current affairs, taught women to read, and taught children to sing. The villagers said, "The students nowadays are really good; they are like family when they come to our homes." In the past half month, they have traveled to dozens of villages and towns, enabling the masses to have a clear understanding of Chiang Kai-shek and the United States: "Chiang Kai-shek is the same as Wang Jingwei; the United States is the same as Japan; if we don't drive them away, the common people will have no good days!"

　　揭穿蒋美反动阴谋
    漳中师生下乡宣传
    【本报磁县讯】激于高度爱国热情，磁县漳滨中学全体师生三百余人组成三个强大宣传队，于本月五日停课下乡。三个大队，宣传动员群众起来对蒋美进行全面抵抗。他们分成戏剧、标语、读报、妇女、儿童、大众黑板、广播台等各种小组，分头到老鸦峪、临水、彭城等一带各村镇工作。每到一地，即演出自己创作的时事宣传剧给群众看，群众极为欢迎。在老鸦峪演出“蒋美合作”，“大后方民变”，“起来保卫解放区”等剧后，当地干部、群众坚决要求续演；在彭城演出“逃难”，“解放区生活”两剧时，群众说：“戏上告诉咱的，比咱开会学的还多。”各地群众都以蔬菜和其他物品赠送他们。南城村群众送了五十斤羊肉给三队同学。同学们不少是农村子弟，他们都帮助老乡扫院子，抱小孩，挑水以至收秋，同时又给群众读报，谈时事，教妇女识字，教儿童唱歌。老乡们说：“现在的学生真好，到咱家和家人一样”。半个月来，他们走遍了几十个村镇。使群众对蒋介石及美国都有了明确的认识：“蒋介石和汪精卫一样样；美国和日本一样样；不把他们打走，老百姓就没时光了！”
