　　[Our front line in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area, 7th dispatch] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Military Officer Training Regiment sent the second group of Kuomintang (KMT) officers and their families, who had laid down their weapons, back to their hometowns on the 29th of last month. This group included 75 people, consisting of KMT officers Wang Boren, Li Shaotang, and Tang Xun, along with their families, who had laid down their weapons in the victory at Dayang Lake along the Longhai Railway. Before their departure, the military region's training regiment held a grand farewell ceremony and feast. In addition to returning all their belongings, each officer was given 500 Border Region currency as travel expenses, and each family member was given 1,000. Because Zeng Qiuzhen, the wife of Li Huansan, deputy battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the Aviation Special Task Brigade, was weak after childbirth, she was given 2,000 yuan, and a rickshaw was hired for her. Instructor Cao of the training regiment personally escorted her for two *li*. The KMT officers bid farewell in tears and swore: "We would rather drown ourselves than fight in a civil war again!"
