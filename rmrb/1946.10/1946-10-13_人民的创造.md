The People's Creation

　　Li Feng Village resident Xu Bowen invents wooden flour mill
　　[This newspaper's Changzhi dispatch, 11th] Xu Bowen, a resident of Li Feng Village, Jiaozuo, has invented a wooden flour mill. The machine has one large and one small wheel. One person can step on the large wheel to drive two stone grinding plates. It can grind three *shi* of wheat per day. The flour sifter also operates simultaneously because there are five small wheels installed on the machine. Ordinarily, each grinding plate requires one animal and one person, and can only grind seven *dou* of wheat per day. This machine only requires two people to take turns stepping on the wheel. The manufacturing cost of the machine is only just over 40,000 yuan, and it can be installed in general rural areas, making it suitable for widespread promotion.
