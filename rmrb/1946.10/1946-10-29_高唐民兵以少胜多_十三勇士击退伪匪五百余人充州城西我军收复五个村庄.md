　　【This article was transmitted by the reporter from Jinnan on the 27th.】The thirteen militiamen of Gaotang, Jinnan, repelled the fierce attack of more than 500 bandits and created a brilliant example of heroic defense. The bandit troops of Pang Changshen, Yang Jingzhai, Deng Xiexhen, and other bandits entrenched in Gaotang, Yucheng, Qihe, and Zhuangping, totaling more than 500, surrounded Jiang Village (under the jurisdiction of Gaotang) in four routes on September 23, attempting to wipe out the militia in one fell swoop. Chu Xiulan, the militia captain, immediately shouldered a machine gun and gathered thirteen militiamen to fight back. Six men met the enemy at the south gate sentry post, while Chu Xiulan and the other seven blocked the enemy at the west gate. Because of the numerical inferiority, Chu Xiulan and the others retreated to an earthen building at the west end to defend it. After two hours of fierce fighting, the enemy concentrated its forces to attack the west building. Four machine guns fired from all sides, and they used square tables covered with wet quilts to create earthen tanks, digging holes towards the bottom of the building, but to no avail. They then resorted to deceptive calls. The seven heroes on the building remained unmoved, aiming and firing at the enemy. Several hours later, the enemy launched another offensive, threatening with firepower on one side and transporting firewood to burn the building on the other. In less than two hours, two of the three floors of the building caught fire. The seven heroes ran out of ammunition and used bricks to hit downwards. Everyone was prepared to sacrifice themselves, willing to be burned to death rather than be captured alive by the enemy. In this extremely urgent situation, reinforcements from neighboring villages arrived, and the seven trapped heroes took the opportunity to counterattack. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy fled in panic. The glorious achievement of this heroic defense greatly increased the people of Gaotang's confidence in self-defense. The Jinnan People's Armed Self-Defense Association (Wu Wei Hui) specially called on the entire region to learn from the seven militia heroes' courageous spirit of killing enemies and defending their homes, and to learn from the Gaotang militia's excellent style of mutual cooperation and joint defense against the enemy.
　　【This article was transmitted by our reporter from Jiluyu on the 24th.】More than 2,000 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops from three regiments in Yanzhou City went to the west of the city to loot grain on the 5th of this month. A platoon of the Eighth Route Army intercepted them, and after an hour of fierce fighting, they were defeated, and five villages, including Hualiuzhuang, were recovered. Two grenade launchers and five rifles were captured, 25 enemies were killed, and five were captured alive.

    【本报冀南廿七日电】冀南高唐民兵十三人击退伪匪五百余人的猛攻，创造了英勇保卫战的光辉范例。盘据高唐、禹城、齐河、庄平一带伪匪庞长申、杨敬斋、邓协臣等伪匪部五百余人，于九月二十三日四路包围姜庄（高唐属）企图将民兵一网打尽，民兵队长储秀兰马上扛起机枪，集合了十三个民兵应战，六名在南门岗哨迎击，储秀兰等七人在西门阻击。因寡不敌众，储秀兰等退至西头一座土楼坚守，激战两小时，敌人集中力量向西楼猛攻，四挺机枪从四面射击，并用方桌盖上湿被子作成土坦克，向楼下挖洞，毫无效果，又改用欺骗喊话，楼上七位英雄丝毫不动摇，一致瞄准向敌人射击。数小时后，敌又发动攻势，一面用火力威胁，一面运送柴火烧楼，不到两小时，该楼三层着了两层，七名英雄弹药打完，复用砖往下打，大家都作了牺牲准备，情愿被火烧死，也不让敌人活捉。在这万分紧急情况下，外村增援民兵赶到，被困的七位英雄乘机反攻。敌人见势不妙，狼狈窜逃。这一英勇保卫战的光辉战绩，大大的提高丁高唐人民自卫的信心，冀南人民武装自卫会（武卫会）特号召全区：学习七个民兵英雄英勇杀敌，保卫家乡的顽强精神，学习高唐民兵相互策应，共同御敌的优良作风。
