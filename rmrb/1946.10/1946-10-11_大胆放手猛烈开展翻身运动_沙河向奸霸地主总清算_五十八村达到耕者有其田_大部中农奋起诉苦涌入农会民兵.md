[Report from our newspaper in Shahe] In the fifty days from August 10th to the end of September, the masses in Shahe launched a general liquidation movement against despotic landlords. Out of 156 villages in the county, 58 villages have achieved "Land to the Tiller," 74 villages are moving towards "Land to the Tiller," and the remaining 27 villages have also started the movement.

The peasants of this county have long demanded the realization of "Land to the Tiller." After hearing the news that they should boldly struggle against landlords and local bullies, the activists in the Sixth District cheered, "Isn't this right!" and rushed back to their villages to launch the struggle. When the activists in the Fourth District held a meeting, the village cadres were so happy that they could not wait and launched the movement in the villages after taking time off at night. The masses in Putongdian urgently demanded a thorough turnaround. Many peasants complained with their whole families. The masses in Zhongwang Village forgot to sleep and eat, and fought continuously for four days and four nights. Ninety percent of the middle and poor peasants in each village united to complain and settle accounts with traitors and despotic landlords. Among the 15,000 victims in the first category of villages, two-thirds were middle peasants, and 1,000 middle peasants had poured into the Farmers' Association, accounting for one-third of the original Farmers' Association members. 118 middle peasants joined the militia, accounting for about a quarter of the original militia. Under the overwhelming pressure of the masses, the camp of despotic landlords was quickly crushed. In Putongdian, a series of backers were chased out from a puppet Bao head, and the masses raised their problems, and the "Top Ten Elite" ruling clique was crushed at once. The despotic landlords who had oppressed and killed the masses in the past quickly returned all their stolen goods, and the lackeys also confessed their mistakes, repented, and participated in the mass struggle.

The main reason for the rapid victory of this movement was that the leadership boldly let go, approved the peasants' land demands, and specifically helped each village find different keys to open up the situation. Putongdian, Gufang and other villages broke the ideological obstacles of the leadership's fear of "excess" and satisfied the peasants' land demands. Dongbeiliu and Dalianzheng improved their enthusiasm for turning over by reflecting on the history of cadres and leading the masses to complain. In Zhao Village, the relationship between cadres and the masses was resolved in advance, the masses made suggestions to the cadres, the cadres reviewed and reflected, admitted their mistakes, clarified their positions, and transformed their work style. In Shenzhuang and You Village, the district cadres supported the masses, removed the spy cadres, and supported upright activists, so that the movement was launched vigorously. The masses in Sanwang Village, Gaodian and other villages participated in joint struggles. Encouraged by the victories in other districts, they recognized their own strength, broke the worries about changing the sky, and the masses immediately acted. Now the movement in the county is developing towards balance and in-depth development.

　　大胆放手猛烈开展翻身运动
    沙河向奸霸地主总清算
    五十八村达到耕者有其田
    大部中农奋起诉苦涌入农会民兵
    【本报沙河讯】沙河群众自八月十日到九月底的五十天中，掀起对奸霸地主的总清算运动，全县一百五十六个村，已有五十八个村达到了耕者有其田，七十四个村正走向耕者有其田，其余二十七个村也已开始运动。
    该县农民要求实现耕者有其田为时已久，六区积极分子听到要放手斗争地主恶霸的消息后，都欢呼着：“这不是对了吗！”急着回村发动斗争；四区积极分子开会时，村干部高兴得迫不及待，晚上抽空回村就掀起运动。普通店群众迫切要求彻底翻身，许多农民全家一齐诉苦，中汪村群众忘寝忘食，一连斗了四天四夜。各村有百分之九十的中、贫农团结起来向汉奸、恶霸地主诉苦清算。第一类村庄的一万五千个苦主中，有三分之二是中农，并有一千个中农已涌入农会，占原有农会会员的三分之一，一百十八个中农参加了民兵，约占原有民兵的四分之一。在声势浩大的群众压力下，奸霸地主的阵营很快被击破。普通店从一个伪保长追出了一连串的后台，群众把他们的问题都提出来，一下就把“十大精”统治集团摧垮了。过去欺压、杀害群众的奸霸地主迅速退出全部赃物，狗腿爪牙亦纷纷认错悔过，并参加了群众斗争。
    领导上大胆放手，批准农民土地要求，并具体帮助各村找出不同关键打开局面，是此次运动迅速胜利的主要原因。普通店，固坊等村打破了领导上怕“过火”的思想障碍，满足了农民的土地要求。东北留、褡裢镇经过干部反省历史，翻身热情提高，带领群众诉苦。赵村事前解决了干部与群众关系，群众给干部提意见，干部检讨反省，承认错误，明确立场，改造了作风；申庄、油村由区干部给群众撑腰，撤换奸细干部，扶助正派积极分子；遂使运动猛烈展开。三王村、高店等村群众参加联合斗争，被外区胜利所鼓舞，认识了自身力量，打破了变天顾虑，群众立即行动起来。现该县运动正向平衡及深入发展中。
