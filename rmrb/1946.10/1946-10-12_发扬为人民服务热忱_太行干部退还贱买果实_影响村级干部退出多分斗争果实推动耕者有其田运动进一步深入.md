　　Promoting Ardent Devotion to Serving the People
    Taihang Cadres Return Cheaply Purchased Fruits
    Influencing Village-Level Cadres to Return Excessively Distributed Fruits of Struggle, Promoting the Further Deepening of the Land to the Tiller Movement
    [Report from this newspaper’s Changzhi, 9th] County and district cadres in the Taihang old and new liberated areas are promoting a style of hard work and incorruptibility, returning a small number of the fruits of struggle that they had purchased cheaply from the masses during the mass movement. This has influenced the broad masses of village cadres to voluntarily return the excess fruits that they had distributed to the masses. The relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened, and the Land to the Tiller movement has been further deepened. County and district cadres in Xiangyuan County unanimously decided at the expanded cadres' meeting in August to return all the fruits of struggle that they had purchased cheaply from the masses during the first half of the year, and not to buy any in the second half of the year. All cadres immediately responded to this action and voluntarily returned things to the masses. Inspections during this movement have revealed that no cadres are buying things anymore. The county and district cadres who led the mass movement in Dongguan in Heshun County also maintained a clean and honest style from beginning to end under the call of the county leadership, and there was no phenomenon of cheap purchases of the fruits of struggle. Hao Erpu, political commissar of the 5th District of Wuxiang, had previously bought a quilt and several items of clothing cheaply from the masses in Songshuzhuang. This time, when the county decided that all cadres should return the cheaply purchased fruits of struggle, he went through ideological struggle. The noble qualities of a Communist Party member serving the people finally triumphed over the idea of personal enjoyment, and he returned everything to the masses and apologized to them at a mass meeting. Li Kecheng, the head of the 5th District, and district cadre Hao Jingbi, did the same. Under the influence of this movement, the cadres of Songshuzhuang also voluntarily returned the excess fruits they had distributed to the masses, eliminating the estrangement between the village cadres and the masses. The mass movement in Songshuzhuang, which had once declined, immediately surged again, and the principle of Land to the Tiller is expected to be implemented soon. Furthermore, the CCP Heshun County Committee conducted an inspection of the political qualities of cadres in the mass movement and made appraisals on the 1st of this month. More than sixty county and district cadres who participated in the movement reflected continuously for two days and also conducted mutual criticism. District cadre Wang Sitang said painfully: "Because I was eager to get married, I wanted to buy some of the fruits of struggle cheaply when I saw them, so I made a mistake. Today, I want to restore my good qualities of serving the masses and guarantee that I will never be eroded." The meeting finally announced the results of the appraisal, and severely criticized individual cadres who had bought too many fruits cheaply. Hao Chengao and other comrades who thoroughly followed the mass line and wholeheartedly served the masses in this movement were awarded silver medals.

　　发扬为人民服务热忱
    太行干部退还贱买果实
    影响村级干部退出多分斗争果实推动耕者有其田运动进一步深入
    【本报长治九日电】太行新老解放区县区干部提倡艰苦廉洁作风，退还在群运中贱买群众的少数斗争果实，影响广大村干部自动将多分的果实分给群众。干部群众关系进一步团结，耕者有其田运动更加深入。襄垣县区干部在八月的扩干会上一致决定，将前半年运动中贱买的斗争果实一律退还群众，后半年运动中一律不买，各干部立即响应这一行动，均纷纷自觉的退还群众。在这次运动中检查，已无干部再买。和顺这次领导东关群运中的县区干部，也在县领导机关的号召下自始至终保持了廉洁作风，没有发生贱买斗争果实的现象。武乡五区政委郝二朴前曾在松树庄贱买群众斗争回来的被子一条，衣物数件，这次县里决定干部全部退还贱买斗争果实时，曾经过思想斗争，共产党员为人民的高尚品质终于战胜了个人享乐思想，全部退给群众，并在大会上给群众赔了不是。五区区长李克诚、区干部郝敬壁等，也都同样做了。在这一运动影响之下，松树庄干部也将多分的果实自动退出分给群众，消除了村干与群众之间的隔阂，曾一度消沉的松树庄群运，立即再度猛烈掀起，耕者有其田的方针，可望很快贯彻。又中共和顺县委曾在本月一日检查群运中干部政治品质，进行鉴定。六十多个参加运动的县区干部连续反省了两日，又进行互相批评，区干部王四堂痛心的说：“我因为急于结婚，一看见斗争果实就想贱买一些，因此犯了错误，今天我要恢复为群众服务的好品质，保证永远不被侵蚀。”会议最后宣布了鉴定结果，对贱买果实多的个别干部予以严重批评，在此次运动中彻底走群众路线，赤心为群众的郝成鳌等同志，并获得银质奖章。
