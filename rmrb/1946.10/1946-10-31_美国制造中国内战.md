　　The United States, a country that bears the obligation of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers Conference regarding "non-interference in China's internal affairs," is, in fact, frantically interfering in China's internal affairs, supporting Chiang Kai-shek in massacring the Chinese people.
    ★  ★  ★  ★  ★
    First, it is the large-scale equipping, training, and transporting of Chiang's troops into North China and Northeast China to attack the liberated areas.

    The U.S. has helped Chiang Kai-shek equip a total of twenty-two armies, sixty-four divisions, eighteen traffic police corps, twenty security regiments, and paratrooper teams, totaling approximately 864,900 people. Most of this equipment was completed after Japan's surrender. After July of this year, with the expansion of the civil war, the U.S. government even planned to equip the U.S. military with thirty motorized divisions. Now, these U.S.-equipped divisions, except for the Second Army in Kunming, have all been used to attack the liberated areas.

    Regarding the training of Chiang's troops, the original plan was to implement it in South China and Chengdu, but it has recently been expanded to North China, Qingdao, and other places. The "Central Naval Training Corps," established in Qingdao last December with U.S. assistance, has graduated approximately 2,500 students. More than 1,000 naval personnel trained in the United States also returned home in July. Up to 2,000 air force personnel have been sent to the United States for training; aviation schools have been established in Hankou and Chengdu, teaching bombing techniques. Regarding the training of transportation personnel, the "Automobile Technology Training Class" in Nanjing, assisted by the U.S., alone has 8,500 students, 1,116 officers, and 1,100 vehicles. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek's army authorities have successively sent cadres to the U.S. for training, and the U.S. advisory group has designed three schools to be established from October, including infantry training and field artillery training, as well as twenty-two military academies and five air force training schools. It is particularly important to point out that the United States has also helped Chiang Kai-shek establish a huge secret police force to carry out terrorist activities against the Chinese people and the liberated areas. For example, the "Sino-American Joint Secret Service Training Class," jointly run by U.S. General Miles and Chiang Kai-shek's secret service chief Dai Li, is located in Xi'an, Chongqing, Ningxia, Lanzhou, Hua'an, Jianyang, Jian'ou, and other places (to establish a German Gestapo-style secret police SS with Chinese spirit and American technology). According to incomplete statistics, the U.S.'s training work for Chiang includes thirteen departments: navy, air force, infantry, artillery, engineering, transportation, automobiles, communications, paratroopers, secret service, traffic, police, staff, military doctors, and military supplies, with a total of 140,000 to 150,000 people trained.

    In terms of transporting Chiang's troops, after the victory, the U.S. side, in the name of "receiving," transported Chiang's troops from the rear or trained abroad to Central and North China by sea and air to carry out the civil war. The New Eighth Army was airlifted from Zhijiang to Nanjing, the Ninety-fourth Army was airlifted from Liuzhou and other places to Shanghai, and then from Shanghai to Beiping, the Seventy-fourth Army from Zhejiang to Nanjing and Shanghai, and the Twelfth Army from Wuhan to Beiping, all between July and October. U.S. Army Air Force Commander in China, Straquat Meyer, claimed: "The airlift of 140,000 Chinese troops is the largest airlift in history." Since then, the civil war has unfolded on a large scale. In November, the U.S. Marine Corps and naval columns, with artillery cover, landed Chiang's Eighth Army in Qingdao to attack the People's Liberation Army on the Shandong Peninsula. Chiang's troops in the Northeast were all transported by U.S. planes and ships. When the war was unfolding in the Northeast, U.S. and Chiang representatives Jirenn and Zhang Zhizhong, under the protest of the CCP, declared that they would no longer transport; however, in April, the U.S. Navy continued to transport the Sixtieth and Ninety-third Armies from South China to the Northeast. At this time, Marshall returned to China and said that he would no longer transport; but in mid-June, the U.S. side transported Chiang's Fifty-third and Fifty-fourth Armies from Guangzhou and Kowloon to Jinan and Qingdao. The U.S. side repeatedly broke their own "promises," knowing that it was to expand the civil war, but used its naval and air forces to transport these two armies to Shandong, and then transported them to Qinhuangdao. In total, the U.S. side assisted Chiang in transporting fourteen armies, forty-one divisions, and eight traffic corps to attack the liberated areas, totaling approximately 546,300 people, and approximately the above number were transported after the ceasefire order was issued.

    In addition to equipment, training, and transportation, the U.S. side also provided Chiang Kai-shek with road protection, road construction, and base construction. After the U.S. military occupied Qinhuangdao, it forcibly repaired the Beining Railway for attacking the liberated areas, built bunkers along the line, and stationed a large army. At the same time, it installed coal trucks for the Kuomintang. The section of the Jinpu Railway from Jinghai to Tianjin was also repaired and guarded by the U.S. military. Many important highways were rebuilt by the U.S. military. The U.S. airport in Nanjing implemented its "bombing mission" with Chiang's air force, and built an airport in Qingdao. As for the joint defense between Chiang's army and the U.S. military, it is even more common in Qingdao, Beiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places.

    Second, the United States illegally continued the Lend-Lease Act, providing Chiang Kai-shek with a large amount of war materials to slaughter the Chinese people.

    According to the estimate of the U.S. "Nation Weekly" editorial on August 3rd of this year, since the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the U.S. government has provided Chiang Kai-shek with $4 billion in aid. This aid has become increasingly blatant and active with the expansion of the civil war. In the past three months, there have been three items: the "donation" of U.S. naval vessels, the passage of the military aid to Chiang bill, and the transfer of surplus materials from the Pacific islands. The majority of the aid materials are aircraft, warships, artillery, ammunition, etc. used for war, enough for Chiang Kai-shek to fight a two-year civil war with plenty to spare. To list just a few of the major items, there are 1,150 aircraft, 471 warships, 58 tanks, 67,000 vehicles (cars, trucks, jeeps), and other items such as artillery equipment, gasoline ammunition, chemical warfare equipment, radios, etc.

    Third, the U.S. military is stationed in China in large numbers for a long time, and infringes and ravages the liberated areas.

    One and a half months after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, foreign troops had no reason to land in China, but the U.S. military landed in China one after another, stationed in Nanjing, Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Qingdao, Beiping, and other places, and had airports in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Chengdu. According to U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Acheson's statement in June of this year, the total number of U.S. troops stationed in China is more than 90,000. The excuse for the U.S. military's landing in China is "disarming the Japanese army and repatriating prisoners" (but intentionally does not mention the accident that Chiang Kai-shek intends to leave more than 20,000 Japanese prisoners to engage in the civil war); the repatriation of prisoners was completed on July 15, but until now, not only has it not withdrawn its troops, but it has continued to increase them. Part of the U.S. Seventh Fleet and hundreds of U.S. military families have come to China one after another, and are building airports and fortifications in Qingdao, claiming that they will stay there for a long time. The new commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, De Hedehua, publicly declared to the Dagong Daily reporter on September 20: "A large number of new officers and soldiers have left the United States for China and will arrive soon. Their mission is to protect the property of the U.S. government and the property of the Chinese government," regarding China as a U.S. colony. In addition to the U.S. aircraft and fleets "donated" to Chiang Kai-shek, there are more than 150 U.S. aircraft and more than 200 U.S. ships in China.

    The U.S. military has occupied Chinese cities, railways, fortresses, and seaports, and has repeatedly invaded the liberated areas. From October of last year to July of this year alone, it carried out 30 intrusions into the liberated areas. Among them, there were 19 carried out independently, and 11 joint attacks by U.S., Chiang, and puppet troops, with a total of more than 4,800 troops used, including more than 2,300 U.S. troops. (Including the bombing of Lulong in eastern Hebei, spying on Yantai and Weihaiwei, occupying Haiyang, Shenhai, Beidaihe, Liushouying Station and other places in eastern Hebei, as well as invading Anping Town and many other famous incidents). Others, such as U.S. aircraft in groups of three or five to reconnaissance and harass the airspace of the liberated areas, have not yet been counted.

    It can be seen from this that the current unprecedentedly large-scale Chinese civil war is entirely "aided" by the U.S. government. Without this "aid," the civil war could not have been fought at all. The U.S. government has pushed China into the abyss of civil war, division, and suffering, its purpose is to turn Chiang Kai-shek into their Wang Jingwei, and China into their colony. At the same time, it is also to turn China into a powder keg for future wars. Therefore, U.S. interference in China's internal affairs is also a declaration of war against the world peace that all mankind is eagerly pursuing. We, the entire Chinese people, resolutely oppose this aggressive policy of the U.S. government; at the same time, we call on the people of the world, especially the people of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, to stand up and demand that the U.S. government immediately stop its policy of aiding Chiang in the civil war.

　　美国制造中国内战
    美国是负担莫斯科三国外长会议关于“不干涉中国内政”的义务的国家；但是，美国在事实上是疯狂的干涉中国内政，支持蒋介石屠杀中国人民。
    ★  ★  ★  ★  ★
    第一，是大量装备训练和输送蒋军进入华北及东北进攻解放区。
    美国助蒋装备齐全的部队，现已达二十二个军，六十四个师，十八个交通警察总队，二十个保安团及伞兵队，总人数约为八十六万四千九百余人。这些装备绝大部分是在日本投降以后才装备完竣的。今年七月以后，随着内战的扩大，美政府且又计划为美军装备三十个摩托化师团。现在，这些美式师团除第二军在昆明外，全部已用作对解放区的进攻了。
    训练蒋军方面，原计划是在华南与成都实施的，最近又扩展至华北、青岛等地。青岛去年十二月在美方协助下成立的“中央海军训练团”，毕业学生约二千五百人。在美受训的一千余海军人员，亦于七月间返国。空军人员派往美国受训者达二千人；汉口、成都均设有航空学校，并教授轰炸技术。运输人员的训练，只南京美方协助下的“汽车技术训练班”即有学员八千五百人，官长一千一百十六人，汽车一千一百辆。另外，蒋介石陆军当局先后派出干部至美受训，美顾问团又设计自十月起成立步兵训练与野炮训练等三个学校及设立二十二个军校和五个空军训练学校。特别要指出的，美国还帮助蒋介石建立了庞大的秘密警察，对中国人民及解放区进行恐怖活动。如美将领梅乐思与蒋介石特务头子戴笠合办的“中美联合特务训练班”，遍设西安、重庆、宁夏、兰州、华安、建阳、建瓯等地（以中国式精神，美国式技术，建立德国盖斯塔波尔式的秘密警察党卫军）。根据不完全统计，美国替蒋之训练工作包括海、空、步、炮、工、辎、汽车、通讯、伞兵、特务、交通、警察、参谋、军医、军需等十三个部门，受训人数达十四万至十五万人之多。
    在输送蒋军方面，胜利后美方即将大后方或在国外受训的蒋军，借“接收”为名，由海空两路运往华中、华北进行内战。计有新八军自芷江空运南京，九十四军自柳州等地空运上海后，又由上海空运北平，七十四军由浙江到南京及上海，十二军由武汉空运北平，时间均在七月至十月间，美驻华陆军航空司令斯特夸特梅耶自称：“十四万华军之空运实为历史上最大一次之空运。”自此以后，内战便大规模展开了。十一月间，美海军陆战队及海军纵队且以大炮掩护蒋军第八军在青岛登陆，进攻山东半岛上的解放军。东北的蒋军全是美机美舰运去的。在东北正展开大战之时，美蒋代表吉伦与张治中在中共抗议下，声明不再运了；可是，在四月中美海军又继续从华南运送第六十军，第九十三军至东北。这时，马歇尔回到中国来，又说不再运了；但六月中旬美方又将蒋军五十三、五十四两个军由广州、九龙运至济南、青岛。美方接二连三破坏了他们自己的“诺言”，明知是为了扩大内战，却又以其海空部队担任运输，把这二军运至山东后，又将之运至秦皇岛。总计美方助蒋运输进攻解放区的部队为十四个军，四十一个师，八个交通总队，共约五十四万六千三百人，而大约数以上是停战令下了以后才运送的。
    除装备训练与运输之外，美方还为蒋介石护路筑路和建设基地。美军占领秦皇岛后，强修北宁路作为进攻解放区用，沿线构筑碉堡，驻扎大军，同时又替国民党装置送煤车。津浦路静海至天津一段，也由美军负责修理及警备。许多重要公路，由美军负责重建。南京的美机场借与蒋空军实施其“轰炸任务”，并在青岛建筑飞机场。至于蒋军与美军共同布防的事，在青岛、北平、天津、上海等处则更属常事了。
    第二，美国非法继续租借法案，大量供给蒋介石各种残杀中国人民的作战物资。
    根据今年八月三日美国“民族周刊”社论的估计，自日寇投降后，美政府给予蒋介石的援助即达四十亿美元。这种援助，是随着内战的扩大而愈益露骨和积极的。在最近的三个月来，即有美海军舰艇的“赠与”，军事援蒋法案的通过，与太平洋各岛剩余物资的出让等三项。在援蒋物资中，绝大部分为用于战争的飞机、军舰、大炮、军火等，足够蒋介石打两年内战而有余。仅举其牵牵大者，其中有飞机一千一百五十架，舰艇四百七十一艘，坦克五十八辆，车辆（汽、卡、吉普车）六万七千辆，其他尚有大炮装备汽油弹药化学战具电台等等。
    第三，美军大量长期驻华，并对解放区侵犯与蹂躏。
    日寇投降一个半月以后，外国军队已毫无理由在中国登陆，美军却陆续在华登陆，分驻南京、秦皇岛、天津、青岛、北平等地，并在南京、上海、汉口、成都设有飞机场。据美国副国务卿艾克逊今年六月宣称，驻华美军总数共有九万余人。美军在华登陆的借口是“解除日军武装和遣俘”，（但对蒋介石有意留下二万余日俘从事内战一事故意不提）；七月十五日遣俘完毕了，直到现在，不但仍未撤兵，反而继续增加。美第七舰队一部及美军家属数百人都相继来华，并在青岛修筑机场，构筑阵地，声言长住不去。而新任驻华美军陆战队司令何德华，并于九月二十日对大公报记者公开宣称：“大批新官兵现已离美来华，不久即将到达。彼等任务为保卫美国政府财产及中国政府财产。”将中国视同美国殖民地。美机美舰队“赠与”蒋介石的以外，美机在华的有一百五十余架，美舰二百余艘。
    美军占领了中国城市、铁路、要塞、海港，并屡次向解放区进犯。仅去年十月到今年七月止，即向解放区作了三十次的侵扰。其中单独进行的十九次，美蒋伪军联合进攻的十一次，共计使用兵力四千八百余人，其中美军二千三百余人。（其中包括轰炸冀东卢龙，窥视烟台、威海卫，占我冀东海阳、深海、北戴河、留守营车站等地，以及侵犯安平镇等很多著名事件）。其他，如美机三五成群的到解放区上空侦察骚扰等，还未计算在内。
    ★  ★  ★  ★  ★
    由此可见目前规模空前巨大的中国内战，完全是美国政府“援助”出来的。没有这种“援助”，内战根本打不起来。美国政府把中国推到内战分裂和痛苦的深渊，其目的就是借此把蒋介石变作他们的汪精卫，和把中国变作他们的殖民地。同时，也就是要把中国变成未来大战的火药库。因此，美国干涉中国内政，亦即是向全人类所热忱追求的世界和平宣战。我们全中国人民坚决反对美国政府这种侵略政策；同时我们呼吁全世界人民，特别是美英苏三国人民起来，要求美国政府立即停止助蒋内战政策。
