Several Experiences in the Yuncheng East Mass Movement

Since the newly liberated areas of Xia'en and other counties in Yuncheng East were liberated in August, nearly 200 villages have launched struggles against traitors and local bullies. The movement is being carried out on a large scale. Now, we put forward a few leadership experiences for reference in various places.

  Unify Thinking in the Movement

    The concentration of power must first have unified thinking. The unification of thinking depends on continuous inspection in the movement, carrying out self-criticism and ideological struggle. Because the various departments participating in mass work have different work natures, cadres' understanding of the mass movement must be gradually unified in the actual movement so that the steps can be consistent and efficiency can be improved. Some comrades have complaints and dissatisfaction in their thinking and should also be organized into the movement, otherwise it is difficult to solve. Some areas only focus on the centralized use of cadres, without paying attention to ideological issues, so everyone's enthusiasm is not high and the movement does not progress quickly. Some areas solve ideological problems in isolation, divorced from the movement, and the result is that they cannot be solved, nor can they quickly push the power down. Experience has proved that each leading organ, especially the senior leading organ, must strictly check its own resolutions from the entire movement, and first seek to make the leading organ and the comrades of the cadres reach a consensus and unity, so that the work can be advanced. Some intractable disputes should also be resolved locally as much as possible, and do not expand the problem, wasting time and effort.

    Remove Obstacles

    The landlords in the new districts, especially the landlords in the areas that have not been liberated for a long time and where the masses have not been mobilized, often set up "farmers' associations" and "militia" to maintain their rule, deal with us legally, and undermine and obstruct the mass movement. The village political power is also secretly controlled by them. Some comrades are deceived by their sweet words and enthusiastic hospitality, or by the "good composition" of the village cadres, and rely on them to carry out their work. As a result, the land problem in some villages has been "solved," but the masses have not yet turned over, and the work has become more difficult, and they have been deceived and failed by the landlords. Many comrades abandoned them, carried out extensive propaganda, went deep into the masses, discovered activists, and also dealt with these people in a timely manner. For example, those who were deceived by the landlords were won over with the power of the masses and asked them to work for the masses. If the masses are willing to change, they will be dismissed or punished according to the degree of threat and damage to the mass movement. Only in this way can the stumbling blocks on the road of the mass movement be removed and the situation can be quickly opened up.

    Cooking in One Pot for Total Calculation

    The ruling figures in the newly liberated areas are mostly landlords and bullies, and also traitors who collaborated with the enemy, with many crimes. Therefore, when the masses move, they mostly settle total accounts and clear everything in one pot. Rent reduction, interest reduction, embezzlement, concealing black land, fighting against traitors, evading burdens, murder, and seizing women are all settled together. If the punishment is the total number of fines and the fruits are distributed uniformly, the most people participate in such struggles, and the actions are magnificent and rapid. It will immediately present a new atmosphere. This method should be adopted more.

    Start with the Village That Can Be Moved

    In the newly liberated areas, the enemy has ruled for a long time, and the degree of rule varies from village to village, so the progress of work will not be the same. It is more difficult to start with a joint struggle in a group of villages to break open the entire situation. Some villages have not done well in their own village and go to take care of other villages; some villages are mature, but they are cooled down while waiting for other villages to act in unison. The result is that they accomplish nothing and give a heavy blow to the practice of mechanically transporting the experience of the old areas with the illusion of "one call, one hundred responses, one move, all moves." The correct experience should be to start with the village that can be moved, and gradually develop into a large-scale movement by making the masses realize their own strength in continuous small-scale actions.

    Administrative Power Must Closely Cooperate

    The landlords and bullies in the newly liberated areas cruelly suppress the people and become local tyrants, and the masses dare to be angry but dare not speak. To launch a struggle against these ruling figures and open up the situation, there must first be open support, resolute backing, and extensive propaganda and enlightenment from the administrative power. It is difficult to start from the lower level alone, or it is very slow. The reason why the movement against the big traitor Pang Changshen was able to be launched was that giving him a devastating blow militarily was a very important reason. This shows that the mass movement in the new district particularly needs the support of administrative power and the close cooperation of mass power.

### 运东群运中的几点经验

　　运东群运中的几点经验
    运东夏恩等县新解放区于八月解放以来，已有近二百多村掀起了反奸霸斗争。运动正在大规模开展，现提出几点领导经验供各地参考。
  在运动中统一思想
    力量的集中，首先须思想统一。思想的统一，依赖于运动中不断检查，开展自我批评与思想斗争。参加群众工作各部门因为工作性质不同，干部们对群运认识必须在运动实际中把思想逐渐统一起来，步调才能一致，效率才能提高。有些同志在思想上存在着牢骚不满，也要组织到运动中去，否则是很难解决的。有的地区只从干部集中使用着眼，不注意思想问题，因此大家情绪不高，运动进展不快。有的地区孤立解决思想问题，脱离运动，结果是不能解决，也未很快把力量推下去。经验证明，每个领导机关，尤其是高级领导机关，必须从整个运动中严格检查自己的决议，首先求得领导机关与干部同志的认识一致与团结，工作才能推进。有些不可开交的纠纷问题，也应力求就地解决，不要把问题扩大，浪费时间与力量。
    扫除障碍
    新区的地主，尤其是解放未久而群众未发动地区的地主、为保持其统治，常先搞起“农会”、“民兵”，以合法应付我们，破坏与阻挠群运，村政权也多为其暗地掌握。有些同志为其花言巧语、热烈招待，或村干部“成份不错”所迷惑，依赖他们去开展工作，结果是有的村庄土地问题“解决”了，而群众还没有翻过身来，工作更增加了困难，为地主所欺骗而失败。有很多同志抛开了他们，进行广泛宣传，深入群众，发现积极分子，同时对这批人物也及时予以处理，如被地主所欺骗的，则用群众力量争取过来，让他为群众办事。如群众愿意改换，即按其对群运威胁破坏程度，分别予以撤职或惩办。只有这样把群运路上的绊脚石除去了，局面才能很快打开。
    一锅煮总消算
    新解放区的统治人物，多是地主恶霸，又是通敌汉奸，罪状颇多，因此群众运动起来，多是算总账，一锅清。减租、减息、贪污、瞒黑地、反奸、逃避负担、杀人、霸占女人等一齐清算，如处罚时是罚总数，果实统一分配，这样的斗争，参加的人最广泛，行动起来是宏伟的，迅速的，翻山倒海，立时会呈现一种全新的气象。这种方式应多采取。
    那村能搞起来就先搞
    新解放区，敌人统治时间长，各村统治程度不同，工作进展也就不会一样。一开始就想搞一片村的联合斗争，轰开整个局面，是比较困难的。有的本村没搞好，外村去包办；有的村成熟了，为等待别村一致行动又冷下来，结果是鸡飞蛋打，给幻想“一呼百应、一动全动”，机械搬运老区经验的做法以沉重一击。正确经验，应该是那个村能搞起来就搞那个村，在不断的小规模行动中使群众认识自己力量，逐渐发展成大规模运动。
    行政力量须密切配合
    新解放区的地主恶霸极其残酷的镇压着人民，成为一带霸王，群众敢怒不敢言。想针对这些统治人物发起斗争，打开局面，首先必须有行政力量的公开声援，坚决撑腰与广泛的宣传启发。单从下层酝酿，很难搞起，或搞的很慢。反大汉奸庞长申运动之所以能发动起来，在军事上给其以歼灭打击是一个极重要原因。这说明新区群运特别需要行政力量的支援与群众力量的密切配合。
