Xinhua News Agency, Jidong Front, 29th: Chiang Kai-shek's troops being transferred along the Zunhua-Tangshan Highway have repeatedly been ambushed and intercepted by the Eighth Route Army guerrillas. On the morning of the 25th, when over five hundred soldiers of Chiang's 450th Regiment were traveling from Tangshan's Northern Liuqianyao, they were surrounded and fiercely attacked by guerrillas lying in ambush there. After a fierce battle lasting about three hours, the regiment's Colonel Commander Xue Shukui, Lieutenant Colonel Deputy Commander Huang Hansong, and officers and soldiers including the Chief of Staff, totaling eighty-four, were killed. The rest fled in disarray. One American-made light machine gun, automatic rifles, submachine guns, and other items were seized. On the 22nd, a unit of over two hundred Chiang soldiers being transferred from Zunhua to Tangshan, along with over eighty carts loaded with military supplies, were suddenly ambushed by guerrillas lying in wait at Sigongzhuang, more than thirty li south of Zunhua. Over thirty Chiang soldiers were killed, one American-made light machine gun was captured, and a large quantity of military supplies was seized. On the 24th, Chiang's troops in Zunhua again attempted to sneak into the Sigongzhuang and Shangchensi area, but were intercepted again, resulting in over sixty casualties. The Tangshan Workers' Self-Defense Corps has also been actively operating in the Tangshan area in recent days, completely disrupting traffic between Chaogezhuang and the Kailuan Mining area. Recently, they also killed over seventy Chiang soldiers in Juanzhuang and Xincheng, north of Tangshan.

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 29th: The military and civilians in the Liaoxi Liberated Area are bravely counterattacking Chiang Kai-shek's troops' encroachment and have recovered important towns such as Halahai. On the Changchun-Baicheng Road, over a thousand Chiang soldiers from Nong'an invaded Halahai, north of Nong'an, on August 5th, and continued north to invade Sanshengyu and other places. Chiang's troops in Yangshanzi and Yangdachengzi also peered west towards Changling. On the 22nd, after local military and civilians launched a self-defense counterattack, Yangshanzi and Yangdachengzi were recovered, over thirty Chiang soldiers were killed, one steel cannon was destroyed, over thirty rifles were seized, and on the 23rd, over six hundred Chiang soldiers who had invaded Halahai were driven back, thus recovering the town.
