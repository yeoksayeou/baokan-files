From Handan, 8th: Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops entrenched in the areas of Qugou and Fengle in Anyang on the Pinghan Railway (both are located about 60 li south of Cixian County, south of the Zhang River) have been constantly stirring up trouble in recent days, but have failed to advance any further and have been continuously attacked. On the 2nd, more than 2,000 puppet troops including Wang Ziquan and Guo Qing from Fengle attempted to cross the Zhang River to invade Santai and Yuezhen, but were repelled by the local Eighth Route Army, with over 200 killed or wounded. On the 3rd, a unit of Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Division, colluding with Liu Lexian's puppet troops and the "Armed Homecoming Corps," totaling more than 2,000 men, launched a three-pronged attack in an attempt to occupy the North and South Guyan Villages five miles west of Qugou, but were repelled by the defending troops and militiamen, with 23 Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops killed or captured.
