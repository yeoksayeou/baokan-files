　　Cultural Briefs
    The Central China Writers Association organized a frontline literary and art work group, totaling eleven people, divided into folk song and fine arts groups, led by Hong Liu and Li Lixing. They are currently distributing over a thousand copies each of already compiled folk song booklets such as "Jingjiang Militia is Great," "Guo Haibo Guerrilla Team," "Logistics Squad," "Talking About Air Defense," "Ten Thousand Years of Happiness for Descendants," and "Sending Off to Join the Army" to frontline soldiers, militia, and civilian laborers to read. They also plan to continue writing various propaganda materials on the front line and intend to compile and print two magazines, "Mass Literature" and "Self-Defense Literature," if possible. In addition, a mass literature work committee composed of ten writers including Huang Yuan and Jiang Ling is massively compiling and printing mass literature books. Seven types have already been printed, and twenty types are currently being compiled and reviewed.
