　　To Ensure the Wounded Recover Quickly: Health Departments Strengthen Work

　　[Report from This Newspaper] The health departments of various field armies in the Border Region are working hard to strengthen medical work in the front and rear areas to meet the needs of comprehensive resistance. They are conscientiously implementing the following regulations: (1) The company medic will go to the front line with the assault squad, obey commands, and maintain close contact with the stretcher team; (2) Ensure that the bandages, cotton, splints, etc. carried with them are all sterilized; (3) All wounds of all wounded soldiers must be disinfected to prevent suppuration and inflammation. If the leg is injured by shrapnel and requires a splint, apply it together with the bandage to reduce the pain of the injured. If the chest is injured and there is danger, inject a cardiac stimulant immediately; if there is excessive bleeding, give a blood transfusion immediately and send the casualty to the rear.

　　保证伤员早复健康
    卫生部门加强工作
    【本报讯】边区各野战部队的卫生部门正努力加强前线与后方的医务工作，以适应全面抵抗的需要。他们认真的实行着以下各种规定：（一）连队卫生员随突击班到前线去，服从指挥，并与担架队密切联系；（二）随身所带之绷带、棉花、夹板等保证都是消了毒的；（三）为防止化浓发炎，各伤员伤口一律消毒。如系腿炸伤，需要夹板时，和绷带一起上，以减少伤者痛苦。如胸部受伤并危险时，立即注射强心剂；若流血过多，则立予输血，送往后方。
