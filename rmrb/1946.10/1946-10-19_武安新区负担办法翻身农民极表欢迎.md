　　The Burden Reduction Measures in the New Wu'an District are Greeted with Extreme Enthusiasm by the Liberated Peasants
    [This newspaper's Wu'an dispatch] The Wu'an County Government recently promulgated the "Burden Reduction Measures for the New District." The regulations stipulate: (1) Newly liberated households will not bear any burdens on their acquired land; new middle peasants will be levied half of their income on newly acquired land, excluding cotton fields. (2) For families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs who employ labor due to a lack of labor, the wealthy will have two-thirds of the wages deducted when calculating the burden. The poor will have all wages deducted. (3) Newly purchased land by honorably retired soldiers will not be burdened for three years. If living with brothers, the land that the honorably retired soldier should receive will not be burdened. (4) For those who raise livestock, one *shi* will be deducted from the total yield for mules and horses, seven *dou* for donkeys, and five *dou* for cattle. After the promulgation of these measures, the liberated peasants expressed extreme enthusiasm. An old man at a meeting said: "Our government is truly good. Before, we had to pay high rent and grain, and couldn't make ends meet all year round. Now we have land and houses, but no one is collecting taxes. The world has truly changed for the better!"
