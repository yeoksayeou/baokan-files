Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd. Central News Agency has been spreading rumors for days, claiming that the Yan'an side has launched an offensive against the Hengshan area. The following are the facts obtained by our reporter's interview: On the 13th of this month, Hu Jingduo, Deputy Commander of the Shaanxi Northern Security Force, unable to bear the ravages and discrimination suffered by the military and civilians of the Northwest at the hands of Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan, and opposing Jiang and Hu's orders for internal war, led the New 11th Brigade of the 86th Division of the 22nd Army and all officers and soldiers of the Yulin Security Command's 9th Security Regiment, more than 5,000 people in total, to revolt in Hengshan, oppose the civil war, and issue a telegram to General Deng Baoshan, General Zuo Shiyun, General Gao Guizi, and General Ma Hongkui. General Hu Jingduo is the sixth younger brother of Hu Jingyi, a revolutionary martyr in the Northwest. This uprising was forced by Jiang and Hu's internal war orders and the erroneous policy of eliminating miscellaneous troops. The Central News Agency is calling a stag a horse, which is extremely boring. The full text of the telegram from General Hu Jingduo and others, more than 5,000 people, is disclosed as follows:

To Yulin Deputy Commander Deng, Military Commander Zuo, Xi'an Deputy Commander Gao, Ningxia Chairman Ma:

We, the children of the Northwest, joined the army and followed you, General Deng, General Gao, and General Zuo, hoping to promote the great cause of the "National Pacification Army" and serve our homeland. For nine years, we have been stationed in the Yulin-Hengshan area, diligently accepting orders, seeking only to fulfill our duties. However, the old troops of our Northwest Army have suffered greatly from attrition, and our army has also been subjected to discrimination. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Government sent Xu Zize to our army to conspire to usurp power. Since then, Chen Changjie, Dong Zhao, He Dingwen, and others have arrived one after another, all wanting to eliminate so-called "dissidents" and implement oppression and annexation. Special agents followed one after another, ostensibly for political work, but in reality, they were engaged in sabotage. Xu planned in the middle, provoking division and discord, using every possible means. Sima Zhao's intentions are already known to everyone. Since last year, there have been two strict orders for reorganization. The Central Government's direct line remained untouched, while the so-called "miscellaneous troops" were greatly reduced. The troops were annexed, and officers were forced to retire. Our Northwest Army's veterans, surplus officers, and their families were arbitrarily trampled on, and Northwest elders and democratic figures were slaughtered one after another. On the contrary, former puppet troops were promoted and upgraded. Officers and soldiers were indignant and heartbroken. Looking around Guanzhong, the Hu barbarians are in power, and secret agents are rampant. Sui and Fu are helping the tyrant, abusing our Mongolian compatriots, collecting taxes and gathering wealth, treating the people like grass. Hu pretends to be powerful, and the national disaster is endless. To blame, Chiang is the one who will destroy China! Are we Northwesterners willing to become American slaves for the benefit of Chiang's family?! Every time I think about it, my heart is burning! Now that the Anti-Japanese War has just been won, Chiang and Hu have issued orders to attack the Communist Party's border areas! Once the war starts, if we lose, our army will be destroyed. If we win, we will be driven to fight again. Day after day, we will be slaughtered until we are eliminated. Killing with a borrowed knife is an extremely poisonous plan! Our army's situation has become extremely dangerous. We cannot bear to see our fathers and elders in Shaanxi and Gansu suffer the calamity of war again, nor can we bear to see the only remaining troops of our "National Pacification Army" destroyed in one fell swoop. For the sake of self-preservation, we have no choice but to refuse the orders for internal war, withdraw from the civil war, eliminate secret agents, and restore our purity. From now on, we will adhere to our original intention, support Deputy Commander Deng and Military Commander Zuo, inherit the spirit of the National Pacification Army, and strive for peaceful nation-building. We also hope that our Northwestern comrades will wake up, rise up and strive for survival, drive out the Xu bandit, and refuse the civil war. Then the Northwest Army will be fortunate, and the Northwestern compatriots will be fortunate! This humble sincerity is presented with all my heart. I respectfully send this telegram and ask for your wise consideration.

Hu Jingduo, Wang Yongqing, Xue Hongdao, Zhang Ziya, Qin Yuewen, Yang Xianchen, Wu Ziming, Zhang Weiru, Wei Maochen, Zhang Yaxiong, Yang Hansan, Jiang Shaowen, Du Xueren, Gao Lexue, Bai Shumei, Wu Fengde, Mei Tingdong, leading the New 11th Brigade of the 86th Division of the 22nd Army and all anti-civil war officers and soldiers of the Yulin Security Command's 9th Security Regiment, more than 5,000 people in total, kowtow together, October 13th.

　　胡景铎将军拒受内战乱命
    率部五千起义陕北
    电斥蒋胡排斥异己卖国内战号召西北军民奋起反抗暴政
    【新华社延安二十二日电】中央社连日造谣，谓延安方面发动对横山一带之进攻，兹据本社记者采访所得事实真象如下：本月十三日陕北保安队副指挥胡景铎，因不堪西北军民遭受蒋介石、胡宗南之蹂躏与歧视，及反对蒋胡内战乱令，率二十二军八十六师新编十一旅及榆林保安指挥部保安九团全体官兵五千余人于横山起义，反对内战，并发表致邓宝珊将军、左世允将军、高桂滋将军及马鸿逵将军之通电。胡景铎将军为西北革命先烈胡景翼将军之六弟，此次起义，乃由于蒋胡内战乱命及消灭杂牌之错误政策所逼成。中央社指鹿为马，实属无聊已极。兹觅得胡景铎将军等五千余人通电全文披露如下：
    榆林邓副长官、左军长、西安高副长官、宁夏马主席钧鉴：职等西北子弟，投身戎伍，追随邓高左诸公左右，盖欲张“靖国军”之大义，效命乡邦；九年来驻守榆横一带，兢业受命，第求无黍厥职。惟我西北军旧部既痛遭斧削，本军亦备受歧视。溯抗战之始，中央即以徐子则派人本军，阴谋篡夺。此后陈长捷、董钊、何鼎文等相继而至，无非欲排除所谓“异己”，实行压迫吞并。特工人员纷纷随来，名为政工，实则专事破坏。徐某居中策划，挑拨分化，无所不用其极；司马昭之心，固已路人皆知。去岁以还，两次严令整编，中央嫡系原封未动，所谓“杂牌”则大加裁缩，部队横遭兼并，军官则强迫退役，对我西北军在乡军人、编余军官及其眷属则恣意蹂躏，对于西北耆宿民主人士则纷纷屠杀。反之，昔日之伪军类皆升官晋级，官兵不平，痛心疾首。而环望秦中，胡蛮当道，特务横行；绥傅助纣，虐我蒙胞，征索聚敛，人民草芥，父老泣途，妻子夜啼。胡假美威，国难无已，论罪也，亡中国者，蒋也！我西北人宁蒋一家之利而沦为美国奴耶？！每一思及，中心如焚！今抗战甫胜，而蒋胡攻击中共边区之令下矣！战祸既起，败则一任我军之覆亡，胜亦驱而再战。旦旦戕伐，终至消灭，借刀杀人，其计至毒！我军处境，至此已极端危险，职等不忍见我陕甘父老重历刀兵之劫，更不忍见我“靖国军”仅存之部队毁于一旦。为自救自保计，不得已拒绝乱命，退出内战，清除特务，还我纯洁。今后仍当一本初衷，拥护邓副长官、左军长，继承靖国军精神，为和平建国而奋斗。并望我西北袍泽＠然猛省，奋起图存，驱逐徐贼，拒绝内战，则西北军幸甚，西北同胞幸甚！区区愚诚，披沥以陈，谨电奉闻，尚祈明察，胡景铎、王永清、薛宏道、张子亚、秦悦文、杨宪臣、邬子明、张伟如、魏茂臣、张亚雄、杨汉三、姜绍文、杜学仁、高乐学、白树梅、吴凤德、梅廷栋率二十二军八十六师新编十一旅及榆林保安指挥部保安九团全体反内战官兵五千余人同叩，十月十三日。
