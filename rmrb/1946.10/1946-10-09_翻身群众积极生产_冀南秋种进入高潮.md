　　Masses Who Have Been Emancipated Actively Produce
    Autumn Planting in Southern Hebei Reaches Climax
    [Jinan Weixian 4th Dispatch] Masses in counties such as Jize, Quzhou, and Gucheng are working tirelessly day and night to actively plant wheat to increase production and support the front lines. "Plant more, harvest more, fill your bellies and fight Chiang Kai-shek" has become the public opinion and a slogan of mutual encouragement among the broad masses. Hao Zhi Kui, a disabled veteran in Xijie Village, First District of Jize, organized twenty-nine mutual aid teams with 706 members, planning to plant 2,500 mu of wheat. They are now actively plowing and sowing, and each team has launched competitions. The disabled veteran Gui Xiao was too tired to lift the plow, but he still insisted on planting his own land and refused any help. Lan Xiuniang, a female labor hero in the Fourth District, in order to complete the wheat planting task ahead of schedule, not only called for mutual aid competitions and accumulated fertilizer by buying pigs, but also led four women with bound feet to dig the soil and plant 35 mu of wheat. Song Ai, a spinning hero, not only mobilized her family to plant more wheat, but also wove seven bolts of cloth overnight, solving the expenses needed to plant ten more mu of wheat. According to incomplete statistics, 21 villages in the Third District have planted 29,000 mu of wheat, accounting for 70% of the original plan. Cadres in the Second District of Quzhou distributed 5,000 jin of relief wheat to families of revolutionary soldiers and martyrs in advance, solving the problem of lack of wheat seeds for these families. The entire district is now striving to exceed two-thirds of wheat planting. The Gucheng County government, on the one hand, promoted and called for research on methods to select seeds and prevent mole crickets, and on the other hand, actively lent wheat seeds to poor people. At present, a tense high tide of wheat planting has begun everywhere. The children's song "China has a Mao Zedong," the women's tune "September autumn wind is cool, make clothes for our army," and the farmers' "Hush... Hush... Go!" and the carters' whistle to scare the cattle are mixed together, resounding through the fields.

　　翻身群众积极生产
    冀南秋种进入高潮
    【冀南威县四日电】鸡泽、曲周、故城等县群众正披星戴月积极种麦增产支援前线，“多种、多收、吃饱了肚子打老蒋”已成为广大群众的舆论及互相鼓励劝勉的口号。鸡泽一区西街村拐腿荣誉军人郝志魁，组织了二十九个互助组，组员七百零六人，计划种麦两千五百亩，现正积极翻土播种，各组并掀起竞赛。荣誉军人贵销的疲劳过度提不动犁，仍坚持自种拒绝代耕。四区女劳动英雄兰秀娘为提前完成种麦任务，一面号召互助竞赛，买猪积肥，一面率领四个小脚妇女掘土种麦三十五亩。一匹纺织英雄宋爱的不仅动员家庭多种麦，且连夜织成七个布，解决了多种十亩麦子所需的花消。据不完全统计三区廿一村，已种麦两万九千亩，占原有百分之七十。曲周二区干部提前拨给抗属救济麦五千斤，解决了抗属缺乏麦种的困难。现全区正为超过种麦三分之二而斗争。故县县府一面宣传号召研究选种防蝼蛄办法，一面积极贷麦种给贫苦群众。现各地已进入紧张的种麦高潮，儿童的“中国有个毛泽东”的歌声，妇女们的“九月里秋风凉，与咱军队做衣裳”的小调及农夫们的“嘘………………嘘…………走哇！”，赶车吓牛的哨音混做一团，响彻田野。
