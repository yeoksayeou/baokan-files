　　【Report from This Newspaper, Changzhi, 27th】The entire Taihang region is currently engaged in an intense campaign to sow wheat. In most areas, the sowing of early wheat (what farmers call the main crop wheat, sown in areas that yield one harvest a year) has been completed. This year, the scale and speed of wheat sowing are both greater. In many areas (such as Yushe and Linxian), farmers have spontaneously expanded the area of wheat fields. The speed of wheat sowing in counties such as Zuoquan, Wuxiang, Xiangyuan, Lucheng, Licheng, and Pingshun has surpassed that of last year. This is because timely rain fell before autumn this year, and the autumn rains have been prolonged. According to estimates in Changzhi County, the area sown has also exceeded that of last year. As of now, according to Licheng's statistics, over 9,320 mu of wheat have been sown in 17 villages including Xiazhuang, Zizhen, and Xiaguihua. Among these, "169" wheat accounts for more than 50%. In Xiazhuang, "169" wheat accounts for 70%. In Xiwu Village, it accounts for over 90%. These villages have all completed sowing within a week. Zizhen sowed 691 mu of wheat in four days and completed all sowing by the 26th. Wangzhuanggou in Wuxiang sowed 1,180 mu of wheat in ten days, and Tielu Village in Linxian has sown 3,000 mu, which is also about to be completed. Bai Village in Yushe sowed over 500 mu of wheat last year, and this year it has reached 752 mu. In Wu'an, the sowing of the main crop wheat has mostly been completed, and Miaoshang Village has even begun sowing the inter-cropping wheat after the autumn harvest. Early wheat sowing in counties such as Gaoyi has also been completed. Gaoyi has discovered that some wheat seeds have not yet germinated and is currently replanting. To ensure a bumper harvest next summer, various places are conducting seed soaking with warm water and salt water. Many villages in Licheng are also using baijiu (white alcohol) and lime to coat the seeds to prevent drought and wheat chlorosis. Lucheng and Licheng are using double-legged seed drills to sow "169" wheat, widening the wheat ridges. Li Yidu in Beiliu Village in Licheng has switched to spot planting to prevent the problem of excessive density and poor ventilation. After discovering that wheat seeds were not sprouting in Gaoyi in the First Sub-district, the district specially issued instructions, calling on farmers to mutually adjust good seeds and conduct germination tests.

　　太行完成早麦下种
    黎城为保证明夏丰收采用盐水白酒搓麦种
    【本报长治廿七日电】太行全区现正紧张突击种麦。大部地区早麦（即农民所谓正茬麦，种于一年一获之地区）下种均已完成。今年种麦规模大而且快。许多地区（如榆社、林县）农民均自动扩大了麦地面积。左权、武乡、襄垣、潞城、黎城、平顺等县种麦之快，均超过去年。这是因为今年秋前获及时雨，而秋霖又为长之故。长治种之，据该县估计，亦超过去年。截至目前为止，黎城统计，霞庄、子镇、下桂花等十七村种麦已达九千三百二十余亩。其中“一六九”小麦在百分之五十以上。霞庄种“一六九”小麦占百分之七十。西仵村则占百分之九十以上。这些村庄，均在一周中全部完成。子镇四天即种麦六百九十一亩，至二十六日即全部完成。武乡王庄沟十天种麦一千一百八十亩，林县铁炉村种麦达三千亩，亦将完成。榆社白村去年种麦五百余亩，今年达七百五十二亩。武安正茬麦大部完成，庙上村且已开始种收秋后的改茬麦。高邑等县早麦亦已完成。高邑有发现麦种仍未发芽者，现正从事补种。为保证明夏丰收，各地种麦均进行温汤、盐水等浸种。黎城各村并多用白酒、石灰搓种，以防旱麦黄疸等病。潞城、黎城种“一六九”小麦多用双腿耧，加宽麦垄。黎城北流村李已犊改用点种，以防止过稠不通风之弊。一分区高邑发现种麦不发苗后，专用已发出指示，号召农民互相调剂好种与进行发芽试验。
