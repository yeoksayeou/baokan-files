　　US-Japan Financial Groups Collude
    Japanese Goods Will Invade Our Country Again
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th] Comprehensive report: Since the 15th of this month, the products of major Japanese financial groups have been continuously shipped to overseas countries. To prevent countries from resisting Japanese goods, a new trademark "Manufactured under Allied Supervision" is affixed to the shipments. MacArthur has approved Japan's export plan for the second half of the year, which includes 50,000 light bulbs, 100,000 bicycles, 30,000 radio vacuum tubes, and 10,000 electric fans. This quantity is approximately one-quarter of the annual average from 1934 to 1939.
    At the same time, the US Commodity Credit Loan has signed a contract with Japanese financial groups, and will supply Japan with 890,000 bales of cotton this year, of which 15,538 bales have already arrived in Japan. This batch of cotton will be woven into cloth for export. Therefore, the number of spindles can be restored to 3.28 million this year, which is greater than the total number of spindles currently in our country. Within five years, Japan plans to restore 4.7 million spindles. In MacArthur's report, he also expressed his willingness for Japan to restore 6 million spindles. Before the war, Japan's main exports were raw silk and cotton textiles, the former mainly to the United States, and the latter mainly to our country and Southeast Asia. Currently, three trade groups in the Far East are consulting with the Japanese government: one representing Australia, willing to exchange wool for raw silk; one representing British territories such as Singapore, the Malayan Federation, and Hong Kong, willing to exchange phosphate, ramie, and coconut oil for Japanese textiles; and another is a delegation from Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to trade high-quality coking coal and crude salt with Japan. In order to further support the Japanese financial groups, MacArthur has specially dispatched Major General Bickel to Asian countries to conduct trade liaison.

　　美日财阀狼狈为奸
    日货将再侵入我国
    【新华社延安二十八日电】综合报导：从本月十五日起，日本各大财阀的制造品已源源输向海外各国。为防止各国抵制日货物，在输送品上贴加“盟国监督下制造”的新商标。麦克阿瑟已批准日本下半年的输出计划，其中有灯泡五万只，脚踏车十万辆，无线电真空管三万个，和电扇一万架。此数量约等于一九三四年至三九年每年平均额的四分之一。
    与此同时，美国物品信用贷款已与日本财阀签订合同，本年内将供给日本八十九万包棉花，现已运抵日本的有一万五千五百三十八万包。这批棉花都要织成布匹以供输出。因此纺锭到本年度可恢复到三百二十八万枚，大于我国现有纺锭总数。五年之内，日本计划恢复到四百七十万枚。而麦克阿瑟的报告中，还表示愿日本恢复到六百万枚。日本战前对外贸易的主要输出品是生丝和棉织品，前者主要市场为美国，后者的主要市场为我国与南洋各地。目前远东已有三个贸易团与日本政府进行磋商：一个代表澳洲，愿以羊毛换取生丝；一个代表新加坡、马来联邦，香港等英属各地，愿以磷酸、苎麻和椰子油换取日本纺织品；还有一个为蒋介石的代表团，企图以上等焦煤和芦盐等和日本贸易。麦克阿瑟为了进一步扶助日本财阀，特派毕克尔少将到亚洲各国进行贸易联络。
