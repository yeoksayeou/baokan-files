　　Democratic Government Loans Millions
    To Support Yantai Fruit Exports
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yantai, 7th] The famous Shandong specialty fruits, Laiyang pears and Fushan apples, are mostly concentrated in Yantai for export. The enemy forcibly organized unified control, and the fruit industry was shut down. After liberation, with the support of the democratic government, the fruit industry resumed operation one after another, reaching a total of ninety-two companies. In April this year, a fruit cooperative was established with more than 460 members and more than 800,000 yuan in shares (20 yuan per legal tender). The Jiu Hai Bank also loaned 500,000 yuan to support its development. Now that the fruit is on the market, the Beihai Bank has specially continued to loan 2.5 million yuan to the cooperative, and another 6.5 million yuan to 73 fruit companies, to help the large-scale export of fruit.

　　民主政府贷款千万
    扶植烟台水果出口
    【新华社烟台七日电】名闻全国的胶东特产水果莱阳梨与福山苹果，大部集中烟市出口，敌寇强迫组织统制，果业均告停闭。解放后在民主政府扶植下，水果业纷纷复业，共达九十二家。今年四月间，成立水果合作社，社员四百六十余人，股金超过八十万元（每元合法币二十元）。九海银行亦贷款五十万元扶助其发展，现值水果上市之际，北海银行特继续贷款二百五十万元给合作社，另贷款六百五十万元给七十三家水果行，以帮助水果的大量出口。
