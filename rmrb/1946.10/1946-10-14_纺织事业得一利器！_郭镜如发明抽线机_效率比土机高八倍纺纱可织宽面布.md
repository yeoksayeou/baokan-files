　　A Great Tool for the Textile Industry!
　　Guo Jingru Invents Drawing Frame
　　Eight Times More Efficient Than Homemade Machines, Spun Yarn Can Weave Wide Fabrics
　　[Reported by our newspaper from Xingtai] Guo Jingru, manager of Xingxing Iron Factory in Xingtai City, has recently succeeded in manufacturing a machine drawing frame. Guo has been trying to make a drawing frame for twenty years, and his wish has been realized with the help of the democratic government after the liberation of Xingtai. This drawing frame can draw five catties of cotton per day, and its production efficiency is increased by seven or eight times compared with hand-cranked spinning machines. According to the comments of the audience during the recent exhibition, the yarn drawn by this machine is still very tough and can be used on iron looms to weave wide fabrics. Each machine is priced at 45,000 yuan, which can be described as good news for the textile industry in the liberated areas.

    郭镜如发明抽线机
    效率比土机高八倍纺纱可织宽面布
    【本报邢台讯】邢市镜兴铁工厂经理郭镜如制造机器抽线机最近已获成功。郭氏试制抽线机已二十年，邢台解放，获得民主政府之帮助始实现其愿望。该抽线机，每日可抽花五斤，与手摇纺线机相较，生产效率提高七、八倍。据最近展览时观众之评论，该机所抽线纱，韧性尚大，可上铁机，织宽面布。每架定价四万五千元，可谓解放区纺织事业之福音。
