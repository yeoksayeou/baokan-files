　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: Washington delayed news: Nourse, chairman of Truman's economic advisory group, told reporters on the 8th of this month that he had foreseen the future economic recession in the United States. Another government economist, who did not want to be named, said, "The United States is in a tide of inflation, and if this tide continues for another two or three years, it will cause a long-term economic panic." He also said that prices are rising faster, and the currency is expanding faster, and when consumers refuse to buy and force prices down, production increases will reach their peak. Another report: The president of the United Automobile Workers Union, Routh, pointed out on the 15th that American monopoly capitalists are creating organized shortages of goods (hoarding) to achieve their political goals. He also pointed out that hoarding hinders the full production of the United States, and due to speculation, prices will continue to rise in the future. In view of the increasingly serious inflation, the U.S. Treasury Department has decided to issue 8 billion U.S. dollars in savings bonds this year.
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 28th: "Newsweek" magazine conducted a public opinion survey in early July, in which many economic authorities and experts expressed their opinions on the peak of the post-war American prosperity and the time of the panic. Thirty-two people were consulted, nine of whom worked in government economic agencies, and the rest, except for two or three scholars, belonged to well-known industrial and commercial companies or private agencies that provide economic information. Regarding the question in the survey, "Will panic come?", sixteen people answered affirmatively, nine answered conditionally affirmatively, five answered conditionally negatively, and only two answered definitively negatively.
    Regarding the question in the survey, "Will the severity of the panic be as severe as in 1929?", twenty-four people answered definitively negatively, believing that there would be a less severe panic like in 1921.
    Regarding the question in the survey, "When do you see prosperity reaching its peak?", the answers are as follows: The earliest predicted time is the first quarter of 1947, and the latest is the third quarter of 1949. The average time of all predictions is the fourth quarter of 1947.
    Regarding the question in the survey, "When do you see the panic coming?", the answers are as follows: The earliest prediction is the second quarter of 1947, and the latest is the third quarter of 1950. The average is the third quarter of 1948.
