　　Greetings! Warriors!
    ——The Masses of Pang Village, Handan Welcome and Send Off New Soldiers——
    "They are doing it for us!" When six hundred new soldiers, rushing from Shanxi to the front lines, prepared to camp in Pang Village, Handan, the masses of Pang Village were stirred. All departments were holding meetings to discuss the matter, mung bean soup was boiling in pots, and vegetables, quilts, and bowls poured out of each household towards the farmers' association. An old lady asked with concern: "Are the new Eighth Route Army soldiers passing through?" Someone corrected her: "Don't call them the new Eighth Route Army, call them new soldiers! Understand? Going to the front!"
    "For the sake of the people!" The director of the farmers' association added, then waved his hand and shouted, "Hurry up!" So, the gongs and drums sounded, the slogans were shouted, and two long lines converged at the village entrance. They were all ordinary people, all dressed in ordinary clothes, all with the healthy faces of farmers with their bronzed skin, and all had guns. The new soldiers' guns and the militiamen's guns equally demonstrated the spirit of combat. They converged, and the slogans also converged. People couldn't tell whether they were saying: "Welcome new soldiers!" or saying: "Thank you, fellow villagers!"
    Only a group of men and women holding radishes, pumpkins, and green onions ran back and forth, not knowing who to give them to. The new soldiers didn't seem to be preparing to rest, not preparing to eat, just shouting slogans, singing songs, and going to the field to hold a joint military-civilian get-together. So, they had to carry them to the newly prepared new soldiers' dormitories, where a group of self-defense team members were busy spreading wheat stalks in the bedrooms!
    "How about we bring all the American guns and American cannons over here?" The director of the farmers' association gave a preliminary congratulatory speech to the new soldiers, but the roar interrupted his speech! "Good!" "Smash old Chiang's offensive!"
    "They are also masses who have just turned over," the director of the farmers' association said to the masses, "Giving up their time at home to fight, what is it for?"
    Ah! Is there even a need to ask? Who doesn't know in their hearts? Just look at that old man who jumped out of the crowd in excitement! When the enemy puppets were here, wasn't he beaten on the head by the traitors? Didn't he have to pay 17,000 yuan in taxes in just one spring? But now, the farmers' association has allocated him three mu of land to turn over, to grow two more bags of grain, and he's been given wheat and cloth. Isn't that worth several tens of thousands, counting savings? Who doesn't cherish this new time! An excited blush rose on his cheeks, and he rushed forward and said:
    "My name is Du Hexuan, I'm in the farmers' association, I support ten jin of rice, and I saw my daughter-in-law in the women's association, supporting five jin of rice!" Immediately, Guo Chunlin also supported fifteen jin, as did Yan Mouzhou, He Shude, and so on.
    Du Hexuan also said: "In the past eight or nine years, have you ever seen a hair of the Southern Army? They abandoned us to the Japanese devils. Now that we are liberated, he wants to crawl back and grab our ready-made meal. Do you think that's okay?"
    "No!" the masses roared: "Defend our fruits of victory! The militia must learn from the new soldiers! Don't let old Chiang crawl back!"
    It was September 24th. That night, Pang Village was unusually lively and busy. The firelight from cooking reddened the dark night. The militia, arranged to prevent special agents, and the self-defense team patrolled all night. The cadres were busy distributing quilts and discussing sending sick people by cart tomorrow. And the new soldiers, with the understanding of "not delaying the production of the common people," all refused the cart. Seriously ill patients became lightly ill patients, and lightly ill patients, encouraged by the masses, joyfully followed the main force to the battlefield! (Zhou Fang)

　　欢迎！勇士们！
    ——邯郸庞村群众迎送新战士——
    “他们为的我们!”当从山西赶赴前线的六百新战士，准备宿营在邯郸庞村时，庞村群众便轰动开了。各系统都在开会议论，绿豆汤在锅里沸腾，蔬菜、被子、碗从各家门里涌向农会，一个老太婆关心的问：“新八路要过路么？”有人纠正道：“不叫新八路，叫新战士！知道么？上前方的！”
    “为的老百姓！”农会主任补充着，便又挥着手叫：“快走！”于是锣鼓响了，口号嚷了，两个长长的行列，在村口汇合，都是老百姓，都穿着老百姓的衣裳，都有着紫铜色的农民的健康的面孔，而且都有着枪枝，新战士的枪与民兵的枪同样表现出战斗的精神，汇合了，口号声也汇合了，人们分不清是说：“欢迎新战士”呢？还是说：“感谢乡亲们！”
    只有抱着萝卜、南瓜和大葱的一群男女们在两头奔跑，他们不知这该交给谁？新战士们似乎不准备休息，不准备吃饭，只是喊口号、唱歌而且走向场上开军民联欢会去了，于是他们只好抱到早已准备好的新战士宿舍里去，那里有一群自卫队员们在忙着给卧室里铺下麦楷！
    “把美国枪，美国炮，通通搞过来好不好呢？”农会主任为新战士预致贺词，吼声阻断了他的发言！“好呀！”“粉碎老蒋的进攻呀！”
    “他们也是刚翻了身的群众。”农会主任向群众说：“放下家里的时光，去打仗，为的什么呢？”
    呵！这还要问么，谁心里没有底呢？就说那兴奋得从人丛中跳出来的老头吧！当敌伪在时，不是被汉奸打破了头么？不是一春天就掏了一万七千元款么？而现在，农会分配他三亩翻身地，多打粮食两布袋，又分麦子又分布，连得带省，不是好几万么？谁不爱惜这新时光呢！兴奋的红云升在他的两颊了，他抢上前说：
    “我叫杜和轩，我在农会，拥护十斤米，我见媳妇在妇女会，拥护五斤米！”立刻郭春林也拥护十五斤，还有阎谋州、何树德等等。
    杜和轩又说：“八九年来，你们看见过南军的毛么？人家把咱丢了，给鬼子，如今解放了，他又想往回爬，抢咱作好的现成饭，你们看行不行？”
    “不行！”群众狂吼着：“保卫咱们的胜利果实呀！民兵要向新战士学习呀！不让老蒋往回爬呀！”
    时在九月二十四，这一夜，庞村异常热闹而忙碌，作饭的火光，映红了黑夜，为防止特务而布置的民兵，自卫队岗哨彻夜的巡逻，干部们忙着分清了被子，又在讨论明日用大车送病号。而新战士们则在“不要耽误老百姓生产”的认识下，全体拒绝了大车，重病号变成轻病号，轻病号带着群众给予的鼓舞，愉快的跟着大队走向战场！（周方）
