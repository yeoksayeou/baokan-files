　　Wang Liu Masses Combine Autumn Harvest with Digging Out the Roots of Poverty
    Autumn Harvest Completed, Even Greater Emancipation Achieved
    [This newspaper's Gaoyi dispatch] The masses in Wang Liu Village have achieved great results in their struggle for emancipation during the autumn harvest. They organized more than thirty mutual aid teams combining autumn harvesting and digging out the roots of poverty, simultaneously harvesting and plowing while using breaks in the fields to dig out the roots of poverty and pour out grievances. In the evenings, team leaders gathered to report, and when each team was relatively mature, they convened mass meetings for settling accounts and pouring out grievances. In the past month and a half, the entire village has completed the autumn harvest, planted 1,100 mu of wheat, and at the same time, brought down more than ten feudal landlords such as Wang Lide and Wang Ting, recovering 843 mu of land, 129 rooms, and more than 20 shi of grain. The masses' morale is extremely high.

　　王留群众结合秋收挖穷根
    秋禾收毕更获翻身
    【本报高邑讯】王留村群众在秋收中进行翻身斗争，获得很大成果。他们组织了三十多个互助秋收与挖穷根结合的小组，一面秋收、秋耕，同时即利用田间休息时间进行挖穷根、诉苦。晚上，小组长集会汇报，各组均比较成熟时，即召开清算诉苦的群众大会。一个半月来，全村秋禾收毕，种了一千一百亩麦；同时斗倒了封建地主王立德、王亭等十余人，算回土地八百四十三亩，房子一百二十九间，粮食二十多石，群众情绪极高。
