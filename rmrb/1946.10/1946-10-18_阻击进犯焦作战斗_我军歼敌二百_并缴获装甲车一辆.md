    Battle to Block the Attack on Jiaozuo
    Our Army Annihilates 200 Enemies
    And Captures One Armored Vehicle
    [This newspaper, Jiaozuo Front, 13th report] (Delayed) More than 200 enemies attacking the Jiaozuo front were annihilated. On the 12th, two regiments of the 139th Brigade of the 32nd Division of the enemy, who were advancing on Jiaozuo, were blocked by our army near the Daiwang Railway Station. We killed or wounded more than 200 enemies and captured one armored vehicle. Our army safely withdrew from the battle after completing the blocking mission. At the same time, a part of the 85th Division of the enemy on the southern front of Wuzhi occupied our Lanxie Bridge on the 11th, and was attacked by our army that night, and the enemy fled in a panic. On the 12th, the enemy reorganized and advanced on Ningguo Town (south of Jiaozuo), but was defeated by our army on the way.
    [This newspaper, Changzhi, 16th report] As the national traitor Chiang Kai-shek is determined to completely break down, the Chiang army's 40th Division in Anyang and the puppet 3rd Column of Sun Dianying's troops stationed in the Qi County area are busy being mobilized, claiming that they will invade Shuiye Town (west of Anyang) and Tagang Town (northwest of Qi County). On the morning of the 12th, a Chiang aircraft reconnoitered and strafed over Shuiye for several hours.
