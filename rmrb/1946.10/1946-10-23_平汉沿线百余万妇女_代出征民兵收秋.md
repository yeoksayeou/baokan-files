Xinhua News Agency, Jin-Cha-Ji, 20th: In the five counties along the Pinghan Railway Line, including Mancheng, Xushui, Dingxing, Yi County, and Laishui, over 1.5 million women have replaced militiamen who have gone to war, throwing themselves into the autumn harvest and planting season. In the county's Beicheng Village, with a population of fewer than 200 households, more than 500 women are participating in the autumn harvest. The village's 600 mu of autumn crops have been completely harvested and fortified day and night. More than 800 people in Yangmu Town left to participate in the war, and the autumn harvesting and wheat planting are all undertaken by more than 700 young and middle-aged women in the village, with labor efficiency no less than that of men. There are many examples of women in various places participating in battlefield work and guerrilla warfare. More than ten female students from Gaoyang County, including Dong Zhiqiang and Wang Guiming, and Wang Xiuhua, a nurse from the PingSui Railway Hospital, automatically organized battlefield rescue teams and have already departed for the front line. Su Guorong, a member of the Women's Federation in Beipanding Town, Ying County, led more than 60 members to participate in the emergency construction of highways to ensure that military transport to the front lines is always smooth. Qian Jun, the director of the Women's Federation of a village along the Zhengding Railway line, once cooperated with the militia to defend the village's fortifications day and night against the invading Chiang Kai-shek troops, and urgently rescued three wounded district cadres and militiamen. The achievements of women in various places in sewing winter clothing for the front lines and organizing battlefield condolences are particularly remarkable. Rong Guanxiu, a model supporter of the army in Lingshou, known as the mother of the soldiers, initiated a "pinch of rice movement," calling on every woman to save a pinch of rice from each meal to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. Hundreds of consolation stations are all run by women from various villages. They donated brand-new bedding for the wounded to use. They collected piles of eggs, pastries, and fruits... and personally delivered them to the front lines to distribute to the heroic Eighth Route Army commanders and fighters. In just over half a month, the women of Fuping completed 41,400 pairs of military shoes. Each woman in Gaojie Village sewed an average of four pairs, all of good quality.

　　平汉沿线百余万妇女
    代出征民兵收秋
    【新华社晋察冀二十日电】平汉沿线满城、徐水、定兴、易县、涞水等五县，已有一百五十余万妇女，代替出征民兵涌进秋收秋种热潮。不足二百余户人口的县北城村，即有五百多妇女参加秋收。全村六百亩秋禾经昼夜突击已全部收割坚壁完毕。杨木城镇八百多群众出发参战，割秋种麦全由村中七百多名青壮年妇女担任，劳动效率毫不比男子逊色。各地妇女参加战地工作和游击战的范例甚多，高阳县女高学生董之强、王桂名等十余人，及平绥铁路医院护士王秀华等，自动组织的战地救护组，均已出发火线。应县北畔町妇联委员苏果荣等，领导六十多会员参加抢筑公路，保证前线军运时刻畅通。正定铁路沿线某村妇联主任钱俊，曾配合民兵，竟日坚守村落堡垒抗击大队进犯蒋军，并紧急救治受伤区干部、民兵三名。各地广大妇女群众为前线缝制冬装、组织战地慰问所创造的成绩，尤为显着。灵寿拥军模范并称子弟兵的母亲戎冠秀，发起“一撮米运动”，号召每一妇女每一顿节省一撮米来慰劳前线战士。数百个慰劳线站，全由各村妇女主持。她们捐出崭新的被服，供伤员们铺盖。募集了成堆的鸡蛋、糕饼水果……亲自送至火线上分给英勇的八路军指战员。半月余，阜平妇女完成军鞋四万一千四百双。高街村每个妇女平均缝四双，质量都好。
