　　Nine Hundred and Sixty Fists Raised to the Sky
    ——A Quick Sketch of the Qingfeng Joining the Army Meeting
    [Jilu Yu Border Region, 5th Dispatch] On the first conscription day in Qingfeng County, nine hundred and sixty young people held a ceremony to join the army. More than fifteen thousand people attended, including village leaders of the new soldiers and their parents, wives, siblings.
    The formal meeting was in the afternoon, but the cannon fire, music, singing, slogans, and the clamor of the people sending off the new soldiers resonated throughout Qingfeng City all morning. The cannon fire from each district sending off the new soldiers was even more sensational throughout Qingfeng.
    On this day, merchants on each street set up tables, put out wine, cigarettes, and all kinds of delicious food, and hung colorful banners on each door. The First District's team arrived at the meeting place first, with a well-armed three-column formation of more than three hundred militiamen at the front, followed by one hundred and sixty new soldiers, and then women, children, and sister groups. The director of the Bian family women's association led the shouting of slogans until her voice became hoarse. They shouted loudly, "If we want to live a good life, we can only send our husbands and sons to join the army." The Seventh District arrived the latest because they had dressed up as Chiang Kai-shek, who was selling out China. Every time they walked to a place with many people, they were stopped for a struggle session against Old Chiang, which delayed the Seventh District's arrival.
    By morning, all nine hundred and sixty new soldiers had arrived and the meeting began with the firing of cannons. County Magistrate Chen first explained the current situation in the border area, praised the conscription models, and finally emphasized, "You can all go with peace of mind! Your families are entrusted to the masses and us in the entire county!" Then came the sister groups presenting flowers and cigarettes, the women presenting wine, and the county magistrate and district chiefs presenting wine. New soldiers who didn't know how to drink also took a hearty sip. Then the new soldiers went on stage to speak. Militia captain Wang Guiren said, "I'm a roughneck and don't understand anything, but I know that Old Chiang won't give us a good life. I can't wait for him to come and create chaos, so I'm joining the army to fight him." Many new soldiers jumped onto the stage wanting to share their thoughts, but the chairman kindly stopped them because it was getting late. Finally, Comrade Wei Chuntang from the sub-district led the nine hundred and sixty new soldiers in taking the enlistment oath: "I volunteer to join the revolutionary army, to serve the people to the end, to oppose Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of China, to oppose the American reactionaries' destruction of China, to resolutely repel the joint offensive of Chiang and the United States, to restore China's independence, democracy, and peace, and will not stop until this goal is achieved. This I swear!" Nine hundred and sixty fists were raised in the air, displaying their firm will and strength. After the meeting, the new soldiers marched in a large parade. It was almost dusk, and lanterns were hung in front of each business, and congratulatory tables were set up again. When the new soldiers passed by, the shopkeepers immediately grabbed them, not letting go until they drank a glass of wine. Two female comrades from the dyeing and weaving factory affectionately put packets of cigarettes into the soldiers' pockets. The Dahua Cigarette Factory brought two large plates of buns and high-quality snacks, knowing that the new soldiers must be hungry at this time, and stuffed them into their hands one by one. In the evening, the Eleventh District Elementary School Troupe performed "The White-Haired Girl" to add to the excitement.

　　九百六十颗拳头举向空中
    ——清丰参军会速写
    【冀鲁豫五日电】清丰全县第一次参军日那一天，九百六十个青年举行了参军仪式，到会群众的一万五千多人，参军战士的村中领袖和他的父母妻子兄弟姐妹都来欢送。
    正式开会是在下午，可是整个午前欢送新战士的大炮声、乐器声，唱歌声和口号声与人们的喧哗声轰动了整个清丰城。各区欢送新战士的炮声更轰动了清丰全境。
    这天各街的商家都摆着桌子，放着酒、烟及各种好吃的东西，各门边都挂着五色标语。一区的队伍先到会场，前头是武装整齐的三百余民兵的三路纵队，紧接着即是一百六十名新战士，后边是妇女、儿童和姐妹团。卞家的妇女会主任领导喊口号，嗓子都喊哑了，她们大声高呼：“我们要想过好日子，只有欢送丈夫儿子参军。”七区来的最晚，因为他们装扮了一个出卖中国的蒋介石，每走到群众多的地方，就被拦住，要开老蒋的斗争会，因此七区就耽误了时间。
    上午九百六十名新战士都已到齐，即鸣炮开会。陈县长首先说明目前边区的形势，表扬参军模范，最后着重说：“你们都放心的去吧！你们的家庭交给全县的群众和我们了！”接着是姊妹团献花、献烟，妇女们的献酒及县长与各区长的献酒，不会喝酒的新战士也都痛饮了一杯。接着是新战士上台讲话，民兵队长王贵仁说：“我是个大老粗，不懂的啥，但是我知道老蒋不会给我们好生活过，我不能等着他来了鸡飞蛋打，所以参军去和他干。”有许多新战士跳上讲台要讲讲心里的话，但因天晚为主席善意阻止了。最后是分区魏春堂同志领导九百六十名新战士举行入伍宣誓：“我志愿参加革命军队，为人民服务到底，反对蒋介石出卖中国，反对美国反动分子灭亡中国，坚决打退蒋美联合进攻，恢复中国的独立民主与和平，不达目的誓不终止。此誓”，九百六十个拳头举在空中，显示着他们的坚决意志和力量。会后，新战士大游行，这时快黄昏了，各商号门前都挂上灯笼，又重新摆上了贺桌，新战士走过时，掌柜的即一手拉住，不喝一杯酒不放手，染织工厂的两个女同志，拿着一包包的烟卷亲切的往战士口袋里装，大华卷烟工厂拿着两大盘子包子和上等点心，他们知道这时新战士的肚子一定饿了，就一个一个的塞到他们手里。晚上有十一区的完小剧团演唱“白毛女”助兴。
