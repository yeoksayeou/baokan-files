[Report from this newspaper in Handan on the 19th] Du Ningfu and 16 other lieutenant-level officers from the KMT’s 47th and 41st Divisions, who laid down their arms in the Taoyuan area of the Heze front, arrived at the military district headquarters on July 16th. General Liu Bocheng, commander of our Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military Region, learned that they were Sichuanese soldiers and took time out of his busy schedule to visit and comfort them. Du Ningfu and others greeted him with gratitude. Seeing the long-admired and prestigious General Liu Bocheng was actually a kind and amiable elder, they had a heart-to-heart talk with him as if they were family. When Du Ningfu learned that his superior, Lei Zhengtai, was General Liu’s student, he felt immensely honored. General Liu showed great concern for his old acquaintances, inquiring in great detail. When the lieutenant-level officers of the 47th Division spoke of the tragic experiences of General Li Jiayu and the Sichuan Army in those years, they were filled with indignation. In the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Army Commander Li fought in southeastern Shanxi, and later died in Shanzhou after being bombed by enemy aircraft. Hu Zongnan, a confidant of Chiang Kai-shek, did not even allocate a single car to transport the body, and even broke up the troops. His younger brother, Li Qingting, also died of anger as a result. General Liu said, "Li Qixiang was my old classmate," and expressed deep sympathy for his tragic fate after his death. A certain lieutenant-level officer of the 41st Division said: In a word, the Sichuan Army is "the temple remains, but the god is gone." Zeng Suli, commander of the 41st Division, was transferred away by Chiang Kai-shek under the pretext of "training." Army Commander Dong Changwan is still nominally in command, but Dong himself has been forced to escape and his whereabouts are unknown.

[Report from this newspaper on the Ji-Lu-Yu Front on the 19th] According to Deng Yaozhang, political instructor and secretary of the 3rd Regiment of the KMT's direct line Aviation Special Task Force: The trend of soldiers in the KMT army being war-weary and deserting is very serious. Most of the soldiers in the regiment are honest peasants from Sichuan who were forced to join the army. The entire regiment had a total of 2,400 people. After the Japanese devils surrendered, they all wanted to go home to farm, but the higher-ups forced them to fight in the civil war. The soldiers deserted one after another. One night, twenty-six people ran away. The officers ordered the junior officers to guard them, but they still ran away. By July of this year, the remaining soldiers in the entire regiment were not even enough to form a battalion. This time, they were sent to the Ji-Lu-Yu Front to fight in the civil war, and they deserted even more severely.

　　刘伯承将军关怀旧谊
    探慰川籍罢战蒋军
    彼等慨叹川军“庙在神不在”
    航特旅川籍士兵多相率逃亡
    【本报邯郸十九日电】在荷泽前线桃园一带放下武器的蒋军四十七、四十一师尉级军官杜宁甫等十七人，于七月十六日抵达军区驻地。我晋冀鲁豫军区司令员刘伯承将军，得悉渠等系四川军人，于百忙中抽暇前往探慰，杜学甫等感激出迎，看见久仰威名之刘伯承将军，竟是一慈祥长者，促膝谈心，俨若家人。当杜学甫得知其上司雷正台系刘将军学生时，感到无上光荣。刘将军对旧日之熟人极为关怀，垂询至详。四十七师尉级军官谈起当年李家钰将军及川军之悲惨遭遇，乃愤愤不平。抗战初期李军长曾作战于晋东南，后在陕州被敌机炸死，蒋介石亲信胡宗南竟连一辆汽车也不拨给运尸，并将部队编垮了。其弟李青廷也因此气愤而死。刘将军说：“李其相是我的老同学”对他死后悲惨的遭遇深表同情。四十一师尉级某军官说：一句话，四川军队是“庙在神不在”了。四十一师师长曾苏励被蒋介石以“受训”为名调走了。董长宛军长名义至今仍在，但是董本人已被迫脱逃不知到那里去了。
    【本报冀鲁豫前线十九日电】据蒋军嫡系航特旅三团团指导员兼书记邓耀章说：蒋军士兵厌战开小差的风气很厉害。该团士兵大部是四川的老实农民，被迫入伍。全团共二千四百人，日寇投降后都想回家种地，但是上边却迫他们打内战，士兵们相率逃跑，有一天晚上就跑了二十六个。官长下命令叫下级军官看守，但结果还是跑，到今年七月，全团剩下来的连编一个营还不够，这次开来冀鲁豫前线打内战，越发跑得厉害。
