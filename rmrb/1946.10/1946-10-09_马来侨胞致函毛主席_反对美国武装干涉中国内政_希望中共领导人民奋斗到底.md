Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: The Overseas Chinese Anti-Civil War Conference in Western Malaya sent a letter to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party last month, expressing firm opposition to the Kuomintang authorities' actions of betraying national sovereignty and dignity and waging civil war, as well as the United States' armed intervention in China's internal affairs, and hoping that the CCP would lead the people to fight to the end. The original text is as follows:

　　(1) Respectfully to Chairman Mao, Yan'an:

　　The motherland has recently been plagued by renewed war, which is extremely distressing. Driven by irresistible patriotic enthusiasm, overseas Chinese resolutely oppose the civil war, oppose American imperialism's interference in China's internal affairs, and oppose the humiliating acts of selling out inland navigation rights and the long-term stationing of American troops in China. In addition to sending telegrams to U.S. President Truman, the Nanjing government, and the Kuomintang, we hereby send this telegram, respectfully requesting that you stop the civil war based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. This is what we hope for!

　　(2) To Mr. Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party:

　　The victory of the motherland's resistance against Japan and the success of political consultation were celebrated by compatriots at home and abroad. All hoped that peace and democracy would be realized soon, and that the task of nation-building would be completed in due course, making China a veritable "one of the five great powers." Unexpectedly, the sounds of victory and jubilation were still ringing in our ears when the flames of civil war rekindled throughout the country. Millions of compatriots suffered another catastrophe, with wailing filling the fields and heartbreaking scenes meeting the eye! In addition, with the bankruptcy of rural areas and the collapse of industry and commerce, the national economy will be in a tragic situation if this continues, and the people's livelihood will be on the verge of collapse. Although we live in foreign lands, our hearts are with our homeland, and our patriotic enthusiasm dares not lag behind others. Witnessing this tragic situation and facing this crisis, we find it difficult to remain silent. We hereby send this express telegram, hoping that you, Chairman, will continue to lead the people in the spirit of heroism and justice to achieve the complete realization of peace and democracy. Respectful greetings for the victory of the New Democracy!

　　(3) Respectfully to Chairman Mao Zedong:

　　Now, with frequent telegrams reporting that the civil war is in full swing, lives are being lost, and the fate of the nation is tragic. What have the people done to deserve this disaster? How can we bear this after eight years of resistance against Japan! Although we live in foreign lands, our hearts are with our homeland. We do not wish to see the flames of war again or hear of the deaths of civilians in battle. For this reason, our association recently convened a conference against the civil war in our homeland to discuss the issue of civil war. All members unanimously resolved to send a telegram to the leaders of both parties, urging them to be tolerant of each other, abandon partisan prejudices, and prioritize the nation and the people. We also hope that your party can reopen the Political Consultative Conference with the Kuomintang to resolve disputes, and urge the U.S. military to withdraw from our country as soon as possible and stop interfering in our internal affairs. If this happens, the nation will be fortunate. We hereby submit this message! With best wishes for your well-being!

    【新华社延安四日电】马来亚西彭华侨反内战大会时，月前致函中共主席毛泽东，表示坚决反对国民党当局丧权辱国与进行内战之错误行为及美国武装干涉中国内政，并望中共领导人民奋斗到底。兹探悉原文分志于左：
    （一）延安毛主席勋鉴：
    窃以祖国近复烽火连天，不胜痛心之至，兹有激于爱国热情不能已于言者，侨胞坚决反对内战，反对美帝国主义干涉中国内政，反对出卖内河航行权，及美军长驻中国之丧权辱国行为，除电达美总统杜鲁门及南京政府、国民党外，特此电达，敬祈基于政协决议原则，停止内战，是所企望！

    （二）中国共产党毛泽东先生钧鉴：
    祖国抗战胜利，政治协商成功，海内外同胞莫不额手称庆，咸盼和平民主实现有日，建国完成事业有期，使中国成为名符其实的“五强之一”。讵料胜利欢腾之声犹在耳际，内战烽烟复燃全国，千万同胞重罹浩劫，哀鸿遍野，伤心惨目！加以农村破产，工商业崩溃，长此以往，国家经济将陷于悲惨局面，国民生计亦将濒于绝境，吾等虽身寄异域，然心系家乡，爱国热诚不敢后人，睹此惨状，面临危机，实难缄默，特此快邮代电，祈望主席本英勇正义之精神，继续领导人民争取和平民主之彻底完成。此致新民主胜利敬礼！

    钧安！
