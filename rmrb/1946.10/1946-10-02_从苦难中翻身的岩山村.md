　　Yanshan Administrative Village in Yangcheng is composed of five natural villages: Yanshan, Lujiahe, Lijia Gou, Nangou, and Shangyuan Gou. The entire village has 247 households, 1,085 residents, and 3,549 mu of land. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the distribution of these lands according to the proportions of each class was as follows:

　　Class 　　　　　　Population (percentage) 　　　　　　Land (percentage)
　　Landlords 　　　　　　5 　　　　　　17
　　Rich Peasants 　　　　　　8.3 　　　　　　23
　　Middle Peasants 　　　　　　34 　　　　　　36
　　Poor Peasants 　　　　　　49 　　　　　　21
　　Hired Laborers 　　　　　　3.7 　　　　　　None

　　That is to say, the landlords and rich peasants, accounting for 13 percent of the population, owned 40 percent of the land; while the middle and poor peasants, accounting for 83 percent of the population, owned only 57 percent of the land. Among these landlords, Shangguan Zhiyuan, Shangguan Guansheng, Shangguan Hengyuan of Qitai Tang, and Shangguan Lingyun were the most prominent. Their method of exploiting the peasants was mainly through land rent. The rent per mu of land was usually between seven and eight dou, and the land leased out was of poor quality, because the fertile land was kept by the landlords to be cultivated by hired laborers. By extracting high rent from poor land, the tenants often had all their autumn grain taken away by the landlords. If there was a good harvest, they might have some left after paying the rent, but few could make it to the wheat harvest. Most of them ran out of food around the spring plowing, so they were forced to borrow money regardless of whether the year was good or bad. The usual interest rate was 5%, and some even charged interest equal to the principal. In addition to the interest, during the busy farming season, they also had to work for the landlords for free or at a low wage for three or four labor days, or even more than a dozen. Some middle peasants borrowed less, but when they ran out of food before spring plowing, they also had to go out to find work. Therefore, during the busy farming season, the labor of poor peasants was mostly absorbed by the landlords and rich peasants, and their own fields were left to women and children to manage, resulting in extremely low productivity. They couldn't even carry manure to the fields, so there was less than 20 dan of manure per mu. They couldn't weed the fields, which delayed the farming season and inevitably reduced the harvest, making the peasants poorer and poorer. Thus, a vicious cycle of cruel exploitation through land rent, usury, and forced labor led to low productivity, and the low productivity forced them to endure even more cruel exploitation through land rent, usury, and forced labor, tightly chained around the necks of the peasants. For example, Shangguan Tingkui, who has now been emancipated, was nicknamed "Ghost Lantern" by the landlords in the past years of disaster because he was so poor that he had legs but no pants, and dared not go out during the day, only at night. He was also nicknamed "Offending the Twelfth Month" because he was afraid of being unable to repay his debts at the end of the year. Twice he spent New Year's Eve under a pine tree outside the village to avoid debt. Such "Ghost Lanterns" and "Offending the Twelfth Month" were a common sight in Yanshan Village at that time.

　　After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang army fled at the first sign of trouble, and scattered soldiers and bandits took the opportunity to loot, making the people's lives even more miserable. In 1938, the guerrilla detachment of the Kuomintang 53rd Army was the first to visit Yanshan, followed by the Kuomintang 83rd and 85th Divisions. In March 1939, Yan Xishan's Eighth Army Group Headquarters and the Third Administrative Office of the Shanxi Provincial Government took the opportunity to infiltrate. In May of the following year, they were replaced by the Kuomintang 169th Division. Until the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain in 1941, when the Kuomintang army collapsed across the board, all these periods, regardless of the number or what "National Army" they were, brought endless disasters to the people of Yanshan. The endless exorbitant taxes and levies are too numerous to mention, but the endless conscription of corvée labor alone made the people exhausted. Every adult male had to serve up to 25 days a month, and each time he had to be gone for ten days or half a month. And when they went out, they had to bring dry rations. How could the poor afford it? Therefore, in order to serve, they had to endure the exploitation of high interest rates and had to pawn their only land to prepare dry rations. It is estimated that the poor in the village pawned about 200 mu of land to serve, forming an abnormal development of landlord usury. Moreover, due to the corvée labor, most of the labor force was withdrawn from production, and the land was abandoned. About 700 mu of land in the village was not planted. Even if it was planted, the harvest was sharply reduced due to the lack of labor and fertilizer. For example, when Yan Xishan's Eighth Army Group Headquarters was stationed in the village, all the manure pits in the village were sealed tightly, and sentries stood on the street, not allowing the common people to carry manure to the fields, saying that it hindered "hygiene." Therefore, in those two years, no more than five dou of grain were harvested per mu. At the same time, livestock also suffered an unprecedented catastrophe. All 33 mules in the village were taken away by the "Central Army," and more than 100 of the 135 donkeys were taken away by the "Central Army" (more than 80 were taken away just for one corvée labor to Duan's). Of the 321 head of cattle, 156 were slaughtered or taken away by the "Central Army." The lives of the people were completely dark and hopeless. They could not afford to raise children, so they could only bear to strangle them. Infanticide suddenly became prevalent, and more than 70 children in the village were killed by their parents. The deaths of these 70-odd young lives are still indelibly etched in the memories of the people of Yanshan.

　　After the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, Yangcheng fell into the tragic calamity of the enemy, puppets, and bandits. There was a puppet regime of the enemy in the city, as well as Ma Boning's regime of the Central Army, and Zhang Conglong's regime of Yan Xishan's army. Yanshan was caught in the crossfire of these three regimes. At this time, the enemy had already occupied Xuequanling and Dongfeng near Yanshan. The people's land was almost completely barren, and they could only sneak back at night to plant a little. The harvest this year was even more hopeless. But no matter in this period or the previous period, no matter how much the harvest in the fields was reduced, or even if there was no harvest at all, the landlords still wanted the rent. The exploitation of land rent and usury continued to increase the weight of the people's suffering.

　　But it was at this time, in February 1943, that the Eighth Route Army came, the Communist Party came, and then the Yangnan Anti-Japanese County Government was established, and the days of suffering gradually came to an end.

　　As soon as the Anti-Japanese government was established, the first decree called on the people to reduce rent and interest. At this time, because the people had just been liberated from the endless oppression of the enemy, puppets, and bandits, they had not yet realized the strength of their own power. The landlords, usurers, and the remaining reactionary forces of the Kuomintang army tried every means to resist the implementation of this decree, so that the decree on reducing rent and interest was basically not implemented this year, but the pressure of rent and interest was slightly eased, and the people were able to catch their breath to reorganize their broken lives.

　　In 1944, because the people had recovered and rested after the previous autumn, and because more than 70 mu of traitorous property were confiscated, and more than 80 mu of communal land were taken out of the hands of the community leaders, the land was also slightly adjusted. Therefore, under the promotion of the production campaign in the entire district and county, Yanshan Village also invested in the production campaign. For the first time, the people cultivated the land as conscious producers, with unprecedented enthusiasm. Although they were attacked after the famine in the previous year, the people would eat mulberries from the trees while working, and they would not reduce their working mood. This year, they finally eliminated all the barren land and opened up more than 30 mu of wasteland. It also happened to be a very good year. After autumn, no one in the village went hungry. In the past, when the autumn harvest came, the landlords would come to collect rent, and even a good year would often become an illusion. In order to protect the fruits of their labor, the people became involved in the rent and interest reduction movement after autumn. Until the spring of 1945, in the nearly half-year struggle for liberation, the face of Yanshan changed drastically. Middle and poor peasants legally returned a total of 583 mu of land from the hands of landlords and rich peasants. The middle peasant class expanded as a result. In the past, 4 out of every 100 people were landless hired laborers, but now the number has decreased from 41 to 20. Even these 20 people have acquired some land.

　　In 1945, the whole village invested in the production campaign again on a new labor basis, improved the form of mutual aid organizations, and maximized the participation of the whole village's labor force in labor. According to this year's statistics, 71% of the male and female labor force in the village have joined mutual aid organizations. Agricultural technology and productivity have also been improved and increased. The harvest has increased unprecedentedly. Although last year was a state of locusts and drought, it was still able to pass steadily. This year, the whole village can not only survive until the wheat harvest, but also has surplus grain. Because of the organization of transportation, the whole village made a profit of 570,000 yuan last year, equivalent to about 500 shi of millet. Therefore, the people's lives are getting better and better. For example, Shangguan Tingkui, the "Ghost Lantern" mentioned above, now has 24 mu of land. Shangguan Zhongyou, a labor hero, originally had only one mu of land, but now he has 14 mu of land. After the autumn of 1945 and the first half of this year, two more inspections and reductions were carried out, and the land relationship changed again. Now the land distribution in the whole village, according to the proportion of each class, is like this:

　　Class 　　　　　　Population (percentage) 　　　　　　Land (percentage)
　　Rich Peasants 　　　　　　0.3 　　　　　　0.5
　　Well-to-do Middle Peasants 　　　　　　9.1 　　　　　　13
　　Middle Peasants 　　　　　　83 　　　　　　82
　　Poor Peasants 　　　　　　7.6 　　　　　　4.5

　　That is to say, the land monopoly system built on the poverty of others has been replaced by a fair and reasonable system. Every rich peasant can get 5 mu of land, a well-to-do middle peasant 3.5 mu of land, a middle peasant 3 mu of land, and a poor peasant 2 mu of land. The rich peasant class can still maintain a fairly superior life, and the people who had no land before, and what is covered up under the numbers of this huge change, is no longer poverty and despair, but the joy of a new life.

　　In the long years of the past, the people could not eat a full meal, and they could not even eat a trace of meat for years. Now it is different. The usual menu is thin porridge in the morning, with some noodles added to it, which is called "Mi Geng" in the local dialect. At noon, they eat rice or noodles. In the evening, they eat "Mi Geng" again. They eat thin twice a day and thick once a day. During the busy farming season, they add a thick meal in the mid-morning. In the past, they ate rice without vegetables, but now they sometimes stir-fry some radishes and beans with a little oil. In the past, they dared not eat rice and only swallowed vegetables (wild vegetables), but now no one eats wild vegetables, and thousands of kilograms rotted last year. During festivals, it is common to buy some meat and grind a few liters of tofu at the market.

　　Now they are also well-dressed. In the past, they were laughed at as "Offending the Twelfth Month," but now every family has a new set of clothes. Not only are they not afraid of the twelfth month, but they also choose styles that fit their bodies. During the New Year, the whole village goes out in a new look.

　　In the past days of suffering, another aspect of the people's lives was combined with ignorance, superstition, and unsanitary conditions. Now all these shackles have been broken. In the past, the whole village respected gods, and everyone kowtowed when they saw the Bodhisattva. Now no one burns incense on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month. In the past, there were four witches and diviners in the village. Whoever was sick had to ask him for elixir, but now no one goes to his door, forcing him to change his profession. The village school has also been set up, and more than 50 children have gone to school. In the autumn, men and women go to winter school and open their eyes to recognize words. The whole village also set up a theater troupe the year before last. The people no longer listen to those feudal operas, but perform their own stories for themselves to watch. Life has completely changed. The people say, "In the past, we were crawling over mountains of knives, but now we are singing ditties."

　　从苦难中翻身的岩山村
    天纵
    阳城岩山行政村，是由岩山、芦家河、李家沟、南沟、上元沟五个自然村所组成。全村共有二百四十七户人家，一千零八十五口居民，三千五百四十九亩土地。在抗战以前，这些土地的分配，依照各个阶层的比例是这样：
    阶层            人口（百分比）            土地（百分比）
    地主            五                        十七
    富农            八·三                    二十三
    中农            三十四                    三十六
    贫农            四十九                    二十一
    雇工            三·七                    无
    就是说，占人口百分之十三的地主和富农，占有土地百分之四十；而占人口百分之八十三的中农和贫农，仅占土地百分之五十七。在这些地主中间，以上官质元、上官官升和启泰堂之上官恒元、上宫凌云等为最著。他们剥削农民的方法，主要是地租，每亩地的租额，通常在七八斗之间，而出租的土地又都是地质低劣的，因为肥沃的土地，地主都留下雇工耕种，以低劣的土地而吸取高度的租额，所以佃户们往往每年秋谷上场，均为地主扫数取去。如遇丰年，交租之后偶也能余下一些，但能接至麦收者甚少，多数于春耕前后便没吃的，因此不管年景好坏，均被迫借贷。借贷办法，通常利息五分，也有本对利者，除利息之外，在农忙时间，还须无偿或低值为地主劳动三四个忙工至十数个忙工不等。部分中农虽少借贷，但至春耕没有吃的，也须外出揽工，所以在农忙季节，贫苦农民劳力，几乎大部为地主富农吸去，自家地里生活只可留给妇女小孩支持，以致生产力极度低下，毛坑有粪也担不出去，每亩地上不足二十担粪，地里有草不能去锄，农时因之失误，收获必然减少，使农民的贫困日陷日深，因此一条由地租、高利贷、力役的残酷剥削造成生产力的低下，又由生产力的低下不得不去加倍忍受地租、高利贷、力役的残酷剥削的循环锁链，便紧紧系在农民的颈上。例如现在翻身了的上官廷奎，在过去灾难的年月里，地主给他起了个外号叫“鬼灯笼”，因为他穷的有腿没有裤，白天不敢出门见天，只能夜里出来。又给他起了个外号叫“犯腊月”，因为年尽没钱还债，自然害怕。他有二次过年，为了躲债，在村外松树下过了腊月三十，像这样的“鬼灯笼”、“犯腊月”，在那时的岩山村是触目皆是。
    抗战开始以后，国民党军队闻风逃遁，散兵游勇乘机抢掠，人民生活愈加悲苦。民国二十七年，国民党五十三军游击支队，首先光临岩山，其后国民党八十三师、八十五师相继前来，二十八年三月，阎锡山之第八集团军总司令部及山西省政府第三行署，乘机渗入，翌年五月，为国民党一百六十九师所接替，至三十年中条战役，国民党军全线溃散为止，所有这各个时期，不管什么番号，什么“国军”，均给岩山人民带来无限灾难，横征暴敛多如牛毛，且不细说，单是无止境的征调徭役，就使人民疲于奔命，每一成年男子每月支差多至二十五天，一次便须十天半月方能回来，而一出门就要带干粮，穷人如何拿得起，因此为了支差不得不去忍受高利贷的剥削，不得不去典当仅有的土地，以置备干粮。统计全村穷人为支差典出土地约二百亩，形成地主高利贷的畸形发展。且因支差之故，劳力大部脱离生产，土地随之荒芜，全村前后约有七百余亩土地没有种上，即使种上的也因缺乏劳力和肥料而致收获锐减。例如阎锡山之第八集团军总司令部驻扎该村时候，全村毛坑均被加盖严封，街上站有哨兵，不让老百姓担粪上地，说是妨碍“卫生”，所以这二年一亩地没有打过五斗粮的。同时牲口也遭遇空前浩劫，全村仅有的三十三头骡子，被“中央军”拉走了，一百三十五头毛驴，被“中央军”拉走了一百多头（仅到端氏支差一次，就拉走了八十多头）。三百二十一头耕牛，被“中央军”宰食或拉走一百五十六头，人民的生活整个是黑暗的，绝望的。生下孩子养不起，只可忍心扼死他，溺婴之风突然盛行，全村这时通过其父母之手弄死的孩子达七十余人，这七十余条小生命之死亡，至今仍在岩山人民的记忆中，烙下不可磨灭的伤痕。
    中条战役之后，阳城陷入敌伪匪的惨劫中，城里有敌人的伪政权，又有中央军马伯鸣的政权，又有阎锡山军张从龙的政权，岩山也便陷于这三种政权的夹击之中。这时岩山附近的雪泉岭和董封已住上敌人了，人民的土地几乎完全荒芜了，只能乘着夜里偷偷回去种上一点，这一年的收成更加没有指望了。可是不管在这个时期或上一个时期，不管地里的收获减少到什么程度，或者完全没有收获，地主的租子仍然是要的，地租和高利贷的剥削，仍然加重着人民的灾难的重量。
    可是就在这时，三十二年二月，八路军过来了，共产党过来了，接着阳南抗日县政府也成立起来了，于是受苦的日子算逐渐结束。
    抗日政府一成立起来，第一个法令便号召人民进行减租减息，这时因为人民才从敌伪匪的无穷压榨之下解放出来，还来不及觉悟到其自身力量的雄厚。而地主、高利贷者、国民党军残存的反动势力，又千方百计的抵抗这一法令的执行，以致这一年减租减息法令基本没有得到实施，但租息的摧迫却由此而稍为缓和，人民却借此得到喘息以整顿其破碎生活。
    三十三年，人民因得到前一年秋后的生聚休养，又因没收逆产七十余亩，从社首手里倒出社地八十余亩，土地也略为得到调剂，所以在全区全县的生产运动推动之下，岩山村也投入生产运动。人民第一次以自觉的生产者的姿态来耕种土地，热情为历来所未有。虽在上年灾荒之余被袭击之下，但人民劳动一回，上树吃把桑椹，也不减低其劳动情绪，这一年终于除把全部熟荒消灭，还开了三十多亩荒地，又恰好碰见个十分年景，到了秋后，全村便没有一人饿肚子。若在往年，秋谷上场，地主便来打租，丰年也往往成一场幻梦。人民为保护其劳动收获，所以秋后便卷入减租减息运动，一直至三十四年春天，在近半年的翻身斗争中，岩山面貌起着急剧变化，中农、贫农依法从地主富农手中退回土地共五百八十三亩，中农阶层因此扩大，往时占人口每百人中即有四人没有土地的雇农，也已由四十一人减至二十人，即此二十人也多少获得一点土地。
    三十四年，全村又在新的劳动基础上，投入生产运动，改善了互助组织形式，达到最大限度吸收全村劳力参加劳动。据今年统计，全村已有百分之七十一男女劳力加入互助组织，农业技术和生产力，也均已达到改良和提高，收获空前增加，虽在去年蝗、旱交加状态，仍能稳然渡过。全村今年不但均可接住麦口，且有余粮，并因组织运输之故，去年全村获利五十七万元，约合小米五百石左右，所以人民生活愈加改善。例如上述的“鬼灯笼”上官廷奎，现有土地二十四亩。劳动英雄上官中有，原只有土地一亩，现有土地十四亩。三十四年秋后及今年上半年，前后又进行过两次查减，土地关系再度变动，现全村土地分配，依照各阶层比例，已是这样：
    阶层              人口（百分比）            土地（百分比）
    富农              ○·三                    ○·五
    富裕中农          九·一                    十三
    中农              八十三                    八十二
    贫农              七·六                    四·五
    就是说，那种建筑在别人的贫困上面的土地垄断制度，已为一种公平合理的制度所代替。每一个富农可以得到五亩地，富裕中农三亩半地，中农三亩地，贫农二亩地，富农阶层仍可保持相当优越的生活，而以前没有土地的人民，而掩盖在这一巨大变革的数目字之下的，现在已不是贫困和绝望，而是新生活的喜悦。
    在过去漫长的年月里，人民吃不上一口饱饭，人民甚至经年累月不能吃到一丝肉，现在可就不同了，通常的饭单，是早晨吃稀粥，赶点面条放在里面，土话叫作“米羹”，中午吃捞饭，或是吃面条，晚上又是吃“米羹”，每天两顿稀一顿干，如在农忙，半上午多加一顿稠饭。从前吃饭不吃菜，现在有时也炒点萝卜、豆荚放点油，从前吃饭不敢吃米光咽菜（野菜），现在野菜放着没人吃，去年一年烂掉千多斤，逢年逢节还到集上称点肉，磨几升豆腐是常事。
    穿的戴的现在也齐整了，从前给人笑话“犯腊月”，现在每家都有套新衣，不但腊月不害怕，还要拣样儿穿得合身材，正月闹烘火，全村出门一片新。
    在过去受苦的日子里，人民生活的另一面，又是和愚昧、迷信和不卫生粘合着的。现在这一切枷锁，也都已打碎，从前全村都敬神，谁见了菩萨也磕头，现在初一十五已再没有人烧香，从前全村有着四个诬巫卜神的，谁有病也要去向他求仙丹，现在没人上他门，迫得只好改了行。村里的小学也办起来，有五十多个娃娃念了书，秋后男人女人都去冬学，也睁开眼睛认字了。全村又在前年办了个剧团，人民再不听那些封建的戏文，自己演自己的事情自己看，生活是完全变了样子，人民提起来这么说：“从前是爬着刀山过日子，现在是口唱小曲过时光。”
