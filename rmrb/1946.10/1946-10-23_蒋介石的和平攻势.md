Chiang Kai-shek's Peace Offensive
*Liberation Daily* 20th Editorial

What exactly is the intention behind Chiang's "peace offensive"? A glance at the statements made by Chiang's responsible personnel in recent days makes it perfectly clear. On the very same day that Chiang Kai-shek announced his eight conditions, his Minister of Propaganda, Peng Xuepei, actually issued a statement saying: "The gains and losses of some cities are of no importance; the entire national territory should be under the jurisdiction of the Central Government." That is to say, China's territorial sovereignty does not belong to the people, but to the evil government of the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families. This kind of "all land under heaven belongs to the emperor" rhetoric, commonly used by feudal emperors, is precisely the "theoretical" basis for Chiang Kai-shek's all-out civil war. Chiang's representatives Wu Tiecheng and Lei Zhen, etc., all made speeches based on the spirit of Chiang Kai-shek's statement, saying: "The so-called restoration of the military positions of January 13 is even more impossible as a matter of fact." But even more blatant than Peng Xuepei and others was Chiang Kai-shek's Chief of Staff, Chen Cheng. While Chiang Kai-shek ordered Wu Tiecheng and others to "urge" the CCP and third-party figures to go to Nanjing for peace talks, he also ordered Chen Cheng to hold a military conference in Beiping to arrange for further expansion of the civil war. Chen Cheng also publicly declared: "Three months, at most five months, can complete the military solution to the problem." In addition to the current fact that Chiang's troops are continuing to invade the liberated areas in various places, anyone who takes a look at the statements and actions of the aforementioned Chiang's "peace envoys" and "civil war experts" can understand that Chiang Kai-shek has no sincerity for peace at all. Anyone can understand that the focus of today's dispute lies in the CCP's insistence on implementing the January 30th truce agreement and the January 31st Political Consultative Conference resolution, while Chiang's side has repeatedly violated these agreements, believing that "the established facts cannot be remedied." That is to say, after January 11, Chiang's troops' occupation of land in the liberated areas and the illegal deployment of troops, as well as many other actions that violated the ceasefire order and the Political Consultative Conference resolution, Chiang Kai-shek and others believe are "established facts" and must be forced on the Chinese people to acknowledge; otherwise, they will continue to fight the Chinese people with a major war. This is the essence of Chiang's "peace offensive." But Chiang Kai-shek's wishful thinking will never work. Chiang Kai-shek is determined to abandon the truce order he personally signed and the Political Consultative Conference resolution that he personally stood up to pass, but the liberated areas and the people of the whole country are determined to protect these agreements that are related to the peaceful and democratic rights of the people of the whole country. These agreements are the fundamental law of the country today. The struggle between Chiang Kai-shek's destruction of the law and the Chinese people's protection of the law will inevitably lead to victory for the latter. The people of the whole country, especially the people of the liberated areas, will neither be fooled by Chiang Kai-shek's peace offensive nor will they be frightened by the big talk of the reactionaries. The people of the liberated areas will insist on implementing the truce order and the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and resolutely smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. The achievements of the self-defense war in the past three months, especially the annihilation of thirty brigades (original divisions) of Chiang's troops, have proven the truth that Chiang's troops are bound to be defeated. Let the reactionaries dream their good dream of "completing the military solution to the problem in three to five months"! The development of events will prove that Chiang Kai-shek, like other Chinese and foreign reactionaries, will inevitably not escape the tragic consequences of underestimating the power of the people.

　　蒋介石的和平攻势
    解放日报廿日时评
    蒋方的“和平攻势”其用意究竟何在，只要看一看这几天蒋方负责人员的谈话就可以一目了然。在蒋介石宣布其八项条件的同一天，他的宣传部长彭学沛竟发表谈话称：“部分城市之得失无足重视，全国版图均应在中央政府统辖之下。”就是说，中国的领土主权不是属于人民的，而是属于蒋宋孔陈四大家的恶政府的。这种封建皇帝所习用的“普天之下莫非王土”的说法，正是蒋介石进行全面内战“理论”根据。蒋方代表吴铁城雷震等均根据蒋介石声明的精神发表谈话，说：“所谓恢复一月十三日军事位置，更为事实不可能。”但是比彭学沛等表现得更露骨的，还有蒋介石的参谋总长陈诚。蒋介石一面命吴铁城等“敦促”中共和第三方面人士去南京进行和平谈判，另方面却命陈诚在北平开军事会议，布置进一步扩大内战。陈诚并公开宣称：“三个月至多五个月，可以完成以军事解决问题。”除了目前蒋军在各地继续进犯解放区的事实以外，只要有一看上述蒋方“和平使者”和“内战专家”的谈话和行动，谁都可以明白蒋介石对于和平是毫无诚意的，谁都可以明白今天争执的焦点就在于中共坚持贯彻一月卅日停战协定与一月卅一日政协决议，而蒋方则一再违反这些协定，认为“既成事实无法挽救”。就是说，一月十一日以后，蒋军对解放区土地的侵占和军队的非法调动，以及其他许多违反停战令及政协决议的行动，蒋介石等都认为“既成事实”，都要强迫中国人民加以承认，否则便以继续大打来对付中国人民，这就是蒋方“和平攻势”的实质。但是蒋介石的如意算盘是决然行不通的，蒋介石决心毁弃他亲手签订的停战令和他亲自起立通过的政协决议，但是解放区与全国人民决心保护这些关系全国人民和平民主权利的协定，这些协定就是今天国家的根本大法。蒋介石毁法与中国人民护法的斗争，其结局胜利必属于后者，全国人民特别是解放区人民既不会上蒋介石和平攻势的当，亦决不会被反动派的大言所吓倒。解放区人民将坚持贯彻停战令和政协会决议，坚决粉碎蒋介石的进攻。三月多来的自卫战绩特别是三十个旅（原师）的蒋军的被歼，已证明蒋军必败的真理。让反动派做他的“三五个月完成以军事解决问题”的好梦吧！事变的发展，将会证明蒋介石和中外其他反动派一样，决然逃不了过低估计人民力量的悲惨后果。
