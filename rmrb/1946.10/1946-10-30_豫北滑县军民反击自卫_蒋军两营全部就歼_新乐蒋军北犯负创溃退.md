[Report from the Yubei Frontline Reporter Group, October 28th] The 124th Brigade of the 111th Division of Chiang Kai-shek's army invaded the Hua County area of our liberated area. Our Eighth Route Army, combined with local armed forces, launched a counterattack at Baidaokou, northeast of Hua County, on the 22nd of this month. After several hours of fierce fighting, two battalions of the enemy's 370th Regiment were completely annihilated, killing and wounding over 300 officers and soldiers below the rank of battalion commander, capturing over 200 officers and soldiers, and seizing eight heavy machine guns, eleven light machine guns, two hundred rifles, and a large quantity of other military supplies. Our army is currently pursuing the remaining enemy and launching a victorious counterattack.

[Report from Changzhi, October 28th] Sun Dianying's puppet army in Yubei was transferred from Qi and Ji to Tangyin on the 20th, attempting to invade both sides of the Pinghan Railway. A unit of the Eighth Route Army launched a surprise attack on Sun's forces entrenched in Changsha, Wanglongzhuang, Gezhenzhuang, Chazhuang and other places (all under the jurisdiction of Tangyin) that evening. After a night of fierce fighting, over 200 puppet troops were killed or wounded, 39 were captured alive, and nine light machine guns, over 30 rifles, and over 10,000 rounds of ammunition were seized.

[Xinhua News Agency, Pinghan Front, October 26th] The two regiments of the 7th Division of the 3rd Army of Chiang Kai-shek's army, totaling more than 2,000 men, which were reinforcing Xinle, continued to advance north along the Pinghan Railway on the 20th, attempting to join forces with the Chiang Kai-shek army besieged in Baoding. They advanced to the vicinity of Ziyuanlou (north of Xinle), where they were completely defeated by the Eighth Route Army. The Chiang Kai-shek army suffered more than 300 casualties, and the remnants fled to Xinle City overnight. The Chiang Kai-shek army's plan to open the Pinghan Railway has once again suffered a new setback.
