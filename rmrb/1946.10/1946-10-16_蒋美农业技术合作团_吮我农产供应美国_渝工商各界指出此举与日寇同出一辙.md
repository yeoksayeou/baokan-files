Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, November 11th: Chongqing News: Industrial, commercial, economic scholars and journalists here have strongly opposed the colonial-style exploitation of China by the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group. On the 5th of last month, the day after the group arrived in Chongqing, the Chongqing branch of the China Economic Enterprise Promotion Association issued an open letter to the group, pointing out that the group's exploitation of four Chinese agricultural products - tea, silk, tung oil, and wool - was for "selfish and narrow purposes." It argued that China needed industrialization and must immediately stop the civil war and achieve comprehensive peace before agricultural reform could be discussed. The Sichuan branch of the Chinese Rural Economic Research Association also issued a protest, stating: If you do not work according to the needs and desires of the Chinese people, the Chinese people will definitely refuse to cooperate with you. The association pointed out: What the Chinese people need is political democracy, an end to the civil war, equal land ownership, and reduction of the people's burden, etc. The protests from all walks of life shocked the group's leader, Hutchison, and deputy leader, Shen Zonghan, to the point that they refused to meet with reporters. On the afternoon of the 6th, the Jiang government-sponsored Import and Export Trade Association held a forum with the group, also refusing reporters' attendance. Later, the Association and the China Agricultural Association and other sixteen groups held a special "welcome meeting," at which Hutchison actively denied the attempt of "industrial America, agricultural China." In the afternoon, the group received reporters and reiterated this explanation, but reporters questioned: "What impact does the US government's military aid to China and the recent sale of surplus materials to the National Government, which fuels China's civil war policy, have on China's agricultural construction?" Hutchison was rendered speechless. According to the plan, the group plans to develop agricultural products such as silk, tea, tung oil, and wool in China for export to the United States to meet the needs of American industry. Democratic figures in the Kuomintang area believe that this is a reprint of the Japanese寇's "industrial Japan, agricultural China."

According to a Central News Agency report: The eleven Chinese and American members of the general group of the Sino-American Agricultural Technology Cooperation Group returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the 6th. The group will write a report based on the inspection and submit it to Washington, it is said.

　　蒋美农业技术合作团
    吮我农产供应美国
    渝工商各界指出此举与日寇同出一辙
    【新华社延安十一日电】渝讯：此间工商界经济学者及新闻界，纷纷反对中美农业技术合作团对中国的殖民地式的开拓。上月五日该团抵渝次日，中国经济事业协进会渝分会，发出致该团的公开信，指出该团开拓中国四种农产品——茶、丝、桐油、羊毛是“自私的陕隘目的。”认为中国需要工业化必须立刻停止内战全面和平，才谈得到农业改革。中国农村经济研究会四川分会亦发表抗议性的意见称：如果你们不按照中国人民的需要和愿望工作，中国人民是一定坚决拒绝和你们合作。该会指出：中国人民所需要的是政治民主，停止内战，平均地权，减轻人民负担等等。各界的抗议曾使该团团长赫契生及副团长沈宗瀚为之惊骇，以至不肯接见记者。六日下午蒋政府官办的进出口贸易协会与该团举行座谈会，亦拒绝记者出席。后经协与中农二会及其他等十六团体特举行了一个“欢迎会”，会上赫契生积极否认“工业美国，农业中国”的企图。下午该团招待记者复作此种解释，但记者纷纷质问：“美政府军事援华及最近售卖剩余物资予国民政府，助长中国内战政策，对中国农业建设发生若何影响”时，赫契生为之语塞。按该团计划在中国开拓丝、茶、桐油、羊毛等农产品，以出口至美国，供应美国工业需要。国民党区民主人士，咸认此为日寇“工业日本，农业中国”的再版。
    据中央社讯：中美农业技术合作团普通组中美团员十一人，于六日由沪返宁，该团将以视察情形写成报告呈送华盛顿云。
