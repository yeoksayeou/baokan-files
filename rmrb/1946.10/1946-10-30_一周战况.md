Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 27th. On both the front and in the rear, the Chiang armies invading Jiangsu and Anhui suffered significant losses last week. The elite 74th Division (formerly the 74th Army) of the Chiang armies advanced on Lianshui, where over 4,000 soldiers were annihilated in the vicinity of the city. On the 25th, the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division reinforced and launched a counterattack, but was severely damaged and repelled by the New Fourth Army. The 74th Division suffered over half its troops as casualties, and the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division was reduced to just over 1,000 men. In central Jiangsu, the Chiang armies invading Dongtai were annihilated at Fuan and Anfeng, with 1,400 soldiers killed. The New Fourth Army has since withdrawn from these two towns, and the two armies are now facing each other in Liangduo, 20 miles south of Dongtai. At this time, the New Fourth Army's local forces launched extensive attacks on the rear of the Chiang armies. On the Grand Canal front, after recovering Fanshui, an important town between Gaoyou and Baoying, they captured Pingqiao and Huangpu, key locations between Huai'an and Baoying, on the 24th, isolating the Chiang armies. Huai'an and Gaoyou are also under great threat. Simultaneously, between Rugao and Taixing, the New Fourth Army's local armed forces captured Jiali City. Except for the isolated stronghold of Huangqiao, the entire 120-mile Rugao-Taixing highway is now under the control of the New Fourth Army.
　　On the Pinghan Front, the Eighth Route Army annihilated over 4,000 Chiang soldiers invading from the north of Baoding on the 24th. Two regiments of the Chiang army's Third Army were routed while reinforcing Xinle, suffering over 300 casualties. A large part of the main force of the 94th Army to the north also lost over 1,000 men during reinforcement. In order to more effectively annihilate the Chiang armies, the Eighth Route Army successively withdrew from the cities of Dingxing and Xushui, as well as Songlindian and Gaobeidian stations. Two weeks after Chen Cheng boasted on the 11th that the "northern section of the Pinghan Railway would soon be cleared," the Eighth Route Army still controlled over 200 miles of it and continued to strike the invaders.
　　In eastern Hebei, after recovering the counties of Leting, Luanhe, and Jianchang in the previous week, the Eighth Route Army again routed over 1,000 Chiang soldiers in the suburbs of Qian'an, Qinglong, and Zunhua counties last week. The Beining Railway continues to be attacked and sabotaged.
　　On the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, after eliminating nearly 7,000 Chiang soldiers this month, the Eighth Route Army withdrew from Juye and Jiaxiang. Currently, the rear of the Chiang armies in Yutai, Jinxiang, Dingtao, and Kaocheng is empty. The people's local armed forces control most of the towns and villages, constantly striking the Chiang armies.
　　In southern Shanxi, the Eighth Route Army controls multiple highways between Fushan, Yicheng, Linfen, Xiaxian, and Anyi, and has recovered many strongholds such as Peijie Town. Hu Zongnan's troops have been compressed to a narrow strip along the railway line.
　　In Liaodong, over 4,000 Chiang soldiers have been eliminated around Tieling in the past week. On the 24th, the army strategically withdrew from the city of Andong.
