　　Responding to the "US Troops Out of China" Movement
    Liberation Daily Commentary
    People's organizations in Shanghai are vigorously launching the "US Troops Out of China" movement. Prior to this, international and domestic democratic figures have also advocated for the immediate withdrawal of US troops from China. Stalin's talks, Gromyko's statement, Wallace's speech, and the "Get Out of China" week initiated by various American democratic groups all fully reflect the unanimous aversion and righteous indignation of people around the world towards the US government's illegal armed intervention in China's internal affairs.

    As everyone knows, the US government's current policy of armed intervention in China has led to an unprecedented expansion of the Chinese civil war and poses a serious threat to world peace. Only those traitorous slaves like Wu Tiecheng and Liu Kai would wag their tails and say things like "US troops stationed in China are fulfilling the obligations of an ally in the China war zone," "I don't know how the presence of US troops in China could cause international friction," and "The Chinese people have expressed nothing but gratitude for the mission of US troops in China," and even say "very good." This, apart from disgustingly evoking ugly memories of Qin Hui, Shi Jingtang, Wu Sangui, and others, only exposes that their betrayal of the country is even more vigorous, more open and aboveboard, and more despicable and shameless than any of their predecessors.

    The "US Troops Out of China" movement in Shanghai and thirty-five American cities simultaneously shattered the shameless rumors of the Sino-American reactionaries who claimed that "the demand for the withdrawal of US troops is just a pretext for the CCP to expand its territory." It is precisely because the presence of US troops in China is already a serious obstacle to peace in China and the world that the Chinese people and democratic people around the world unanimously demand the swift withdrawal of US troops from China. In the vast areas of China under Chiang Kai-shek's rule, regardless of how the fascist traitors deceive, slander, and suppress them, the people have now, following the ten-thousand-person anti-civil war demonstration, launched a widespread "US Troops Out of China" movement. Undoubtedly, this movement is an important sign of the further development of the great movement of peace-loving people around the world against US imperialist aid to Chiang's civil war. This movement gives great encouragement to the self-defense war of our liberated area's military and civilians, and we in the liberated areas must strive to respond to and support this movement. This movement shows that the Sino-American reactionaries are isolated, helpless, outwardly strong but inwardly weak, while the people's power is strong and growing stronger day by day. If the US government insists on violating the Moscow Three-Power Agreement, armed intervention in China's internal affairs and threatening world peace, and is willing to be the enemy of the Chinese people and the people of the world, it will eventually play with fire and burn itself, repeating the mistakes of Japanese fascism.

　　响应“美军退出中国运动”
    解放日报时评
    上海各界人民团体正奋起开展“美军退出中国”运动。在此以前，国际朝野民主人士亦均主张美军立即撤离中国，斯大林谈话、葛罗米柯声明、华莱士演说和美国各民主团体所发起的“退出中国”周，都充分反映全世界人民对于美国政府武装干涉中国内政的不法行为一致表示厌恶和义愤。
    众所周知，美国政府今天武装干涉中国的政策，已使中国内战空前扩大，使世界和平感受严重威胁，只有那些卖国奴才如吴铁城、刘锴辈，才会摇着尾巴说出“驻华美军为中国战区同盟国一员之义务”，“不知道美军驻华如何会引起国际的磨擦”，以及“中国人民对抗美军在华的任务无不表示感激”，和会说“顶好”之类的话。这除令人恶心地引起关于秦桧、石敬塘、吴三桂等丑恶的回忆之外，就只能暴露他们的卖国较之任何他们的前辈更加卖力，更加公开堂皇，更加卑鄙无耻而已。
    上海和美国三十五个城市的“美军退出中国”运动，同时又粉碎了中美反动派所称“要求美军撤退，只是中共借口扩张地盘”的无耻谰言。正因为美军驻华已经是中国与世界和平的严重阻碍，所以中国人民和全世界民主人士一致要求美军迅速退出中国。在中国蒋介石统治地区的广大人民，更不管法西斯卖国贼们如何欺骗毁谤和镇压，今天已继十万人反内战大游行后，开展广泛的“美军退出中国”运动，无疑的，这一运动是全世界和平人士反对美帝国主义的援蒋内战的伟大运动进一步开展的重要标志，这个运动给我们解放区军民的自卫战争以极大的鼓励，而我们解放区军民对于这个运动，自必努力响应和支援。这一运动，说明中美反动派是独立无助外强中干的，而人民力量则是强大的，并一天比一天强大。如果美国政府坚持违背莫斯科三国协议，武装干涉中国内政威胁世界和平，甘与中国与全世界人民为敌，则终必玩火自焚，重蹈日本法西斯的覆辙。（九月二十九日）
