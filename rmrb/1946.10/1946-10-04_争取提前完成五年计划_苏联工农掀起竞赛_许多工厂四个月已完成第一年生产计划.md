Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 30th: Moscow News: The All-Soviet socialist competition, held to complete the Fourth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, has now entered its fifth month, with millions of workers and peasants participating. The most significant achievement of the competition in the past four months has been the increase in the average output of many factories, and thousands of Stakhanovite workers have completed the first year's production plan of the new Five-Year Plan. For example, in Gorky City, more than 6,000 workers in various industries have exceeded this year's production plan, and hundreds of advanced workers are now producing two to three times more products than they produce in a year. Dozens of factories have completed several months of production plans ahead of schedule, and some factories have completed the entire year's production plan. Workers participating in the competition are creating new records every day. In the Donets Coal Basin, the young miner Rukov's team, famous for its high-speed Stakhanovite work methods, has now created an amazing record of increasing output by 48 percent. Miner Zloti, a representative of the Supreme Soviet, can produce 7,000 to 8,000 tons of coal per month with his coal mining machine, while the average output of each machine is 300 tons per month. Harvester driver Mosvin swore to create a record of harvesting 3,500 hectares of land, but ended up harvesting 4,300 hectares of land.
