　　Civilian Textile Production in the Self-Defense War
    Liberation Daily Editorial, October 18th
    Today's comprehensive report on the civilian textile industry in the liberated areas (see page two of this newspaper) illustrates several points: First, the development of civilian textile production has greatly increased the wealth of farmers; in some areas, it even exceeds the total value of agricultural harvests. In the liberated areas, where the land reform movement continues to develop universally and deeply, and farmers have already obtained land and food, self-spinning and self-weaving not only help farmers solve the problem of clothing (according to the experience of northern Shaanxi, the cost of clothing for farmers accounts for about half of their agricultural harvest), but also provide them with new funds to expand agricultural production. This can gradually reduce the scissor difference between agricultural products and daily necessities, stimulate land price increases, greatly increase farmers' interest in developing production, and allow many farmers to become wealthy through textile production. Zhang Zhenwu, who used to beg for a living in Gaoyang, jumped to become a well-fed and clothed farmer in half a year. What a vivid and touching fact this is.
    Second, in some areas with poor land and a large population with little land, land reform alone cannot solve all of the farmers' economic problems. It is necessary to supplement it with the development of side occupations, of which textile production is the most important, because textile production has the most traditional foundation among the people and is the most universally developed side occupation. Only through "spinning and weaving" can it be possible to "become wealthy."
    Third, through textile production, some places have solved a major social problem—the problem of improving the social status of women. Today, respecting women has become a social norm in the liberated areas. This is not just the effect of a piece of legislation, but rather that women have first gained a position economically through textile production and other production activities. For the construction of the liberated areas, out of 140 million people, in addition to the 70 million men, the 70 million women have also been mobilized. This is a huge force.
    How then to develop the textile industry? The comprehensive news itself also provides good experience: "The unified supply and marketing and organizational leadership of village cooperatives, and the development of family-based self-spinning and self-weaving, are the best ways to promote the development of the civilian textile industry." That is to say, the textile business should be developed into a mass movement, achieving "every family spins, every village weaves." In all villages with cooperatives, the village cooperative should generally take organizing and promoting textile production as its central business. They can uniformly purchase cotton to supply the spinners, purchase the products, and serve the spinners, uniting the spinners around themselves. Densely populated villages can also organize women's spinning groups, and organize and lead through the groups. Cooperatives can also open small-scale textile mills, turning the purchased yarn into cloth locally to supply the clothing needs of the village. How to do it and what the scale of business should be naturally depends on the local situation. In areas that have already undergone land reform, the central work of the women's federations should also be placed on organizing women's production, especially textile production, and they can cooperate with the cooperatives to carry it out jointly. Chinese rural areas, especially rural areas in North China, have a foundation in textile production. "Men plow and women weave" is a traditional custom, and farmers are also well aware of the benefits of textile production. It can be seen that if the organization and leadership are good, there is complete confidence that textile production can be turned into a mass movement.
    At present, our basic base is in the countryside. In the long-term and increasingly expanding civil war, although Chiang Kai-shek can seize some cities, the vast countryside is still in our hands. The countryside will be even larger in the future than it is now. In order to build the countryside, we have continued to vigorously carry out the movement of "land to the tiller" and increase agricultural production to solve the problem of eating. We must also vigorously carry out the movement of "self-cultivation, self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-clothing" to solve the problem of clothing. With the problems of eating and clothing solved, we can stand firm and persist in total resistance to the end. Any idea of ​​relying solely on big cities and big factories, or relying on the supply of foreign goods, is bound to fail. We must rely on the countryside and the strength of the vast number of farmers to solve economic difficulties by relying on our own efforts, self-sufficiency, and self-reliance. We already have the experience and foundation of being completely self-sufficient in financial supply and demand during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In this self-defense war, we have even more ways, and we will definitely be victorious.

　　自卫战争中的民间纺织
    解放日报十八日社论
    今日解放区民间纺织业的综合报导（见本报二版）说明了几个问题：第一、民间纺织之发展，大大增加了农民财富，个别地区甚且超过农产收获总值。在解放区土地改革运动继续普遍与深入发展，农民已获得土地与粮食之后，自纺自织不仅帮助了农民解决了穿衣问题（据陕北经验，农民所需衣服费用约占其农业收获之一半），而且使他们有了新的资金扩大发展农业生产，这样可使农产品与日用品之剪刀差额逐渐降低，刺激土地价格上涨，农民发展生产之兴趣，大大提高，不少农民甚至赖纺织起家。高阳以乞讨度日的张振武，半年中一跃而为丰衣足食的农民，这是何等生动感人的事实。
    第二、有些土地贫瘠和地少人多的地方，经过土地改革尚不能解决农民全部经济问题，必须辅以副业之发展，其中又以纺织为首，因为纺织是民间最有传统基础，而且最能普遍发展的副业，只有“纺纱织布”，“发家致富”始有可能。
    第三、通过纺织，有些地方解决了一个社会重大问题——提高了妇女社会地位问题。今天解放区尊重妇女已成社会风气，这不能仅仅是一纸法令的效果，而是妇女通过纺织等生产首先在经济上有了地位。对于解放区建设来说，一万万四千万人中，除了七千万男子外，七千万的妇女也发动起来了，这是一支巨大的力量。
    然则如何发展纺织业？在综合新闻本身也提供了很好的经验：“村合作社的统一供销与组织领导，发展以家庭为单位的自纺自织，是促进民间纺织业发展的最好办法。”这就是说，要把纺织事业发展为一个群众运动，做到“家家纺纱，村村织布。”凡是有合作社的村庄，村合作社一般应以组织和推广纺织为自己的中心业务，他们可以统一采购棉花供应纺妇，收买产品，为纺妇服务，把纺妇团结在自己周围。人烟稠密的村庄还可组织妇纺小组，通过小组，来进行组织和领导。合作社也可开设小规模的纺织厂，把收购的棉纱就在当地制成布匹，供给本村被服之需。究竟如何作法，营业规模怎样，自然还得视当地情形而定。妇联会在已经经过土地改革的地方，中心工作亦应放在组织妇女的生产，特别是纺织生产，可以与合作社联系共同配合进行。中国农村尤其是华北农村，向有纺织基础，“男耕女织”，是传统的风俗，农民也深知纺织的利益，可见组织领导得好，是完全有把握把纺织造成为一种群众运动的。
    目前我们的基本阵地是在农村，在长期与日益扩大的内战中，蒋介石虽可侵占若干城市，但广大农村仍在我手，农村在将来甚至比现在还要扩大，为着建设农村，我们已经继续大力进行耕者有其田和增加农产的运动以解决吃饭的问题，我们还要大力开展自种自纺自织自穿运动，以解决穿衣的问题。穿的吃的都解决了，我们就能站稳脚跟，坚持全面抵抗到底，任何把眼光仅仅寄托于大城市大工厂或者是依赖外货供应的想法，是一定要失败。我们要依靠农村，依靠广大农民的力量，一切自造自给自力更生的解决经济困难。我们已经有了在抗日战争中财政供需完全自给的经验和基础，在这次自卫战争中，我们更有办法，我们一定能够胜利。
