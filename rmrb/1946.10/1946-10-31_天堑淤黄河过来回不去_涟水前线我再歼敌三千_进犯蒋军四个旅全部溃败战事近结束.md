Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: After eight days of continuous fierce fighting, the four brigades (formerly divisions) of Chiang's troops invading Lianshui in three routes have been completely routed, with over 7,000 annihilated. Thus, the powerful offensive against the central area of ​​northern Jiangsu, which Chiang's troops prepared for a month, has been crushed by the elite field troops of the New Fourth Army. Now, there are no traces of Chiang's troops north of the silted Yellow River. A small number of remaining Chiang troops west of Henan Jiaojiao Town and east of Qinong Town are being surrounded and annihilated by the New Fourth Army. This campaign began on the 19th, when Chiang's troops, with three brigades of the 74th Division (formerly the 74th Army), launched a multi-pronged attack on Lianshui. They were met with a fierce counterattack by the New Fourth Army, which annihilated more than 4,000 of them on the 23rd and 24th. On the 25th, Chiang's troops reinforced with the 129th Brigade of the 28th Division, cooperating with the remnants of the 74th Division, and launched another counterattack. A unit of the New Fourth Army inserted itself rapidly into the rear of Chiang's troops, recovering Shunheji, five miles east of Huaiyin, on the evening of the 24th, cutting off the retreat route of the invading Chiang troops. The Lianshui garrison then coordinated and counterattacked the invading troops, driving them to the Yellow River sand滩 southwest of the city to be annihilated. On the night of the 25th, nearly 2,000 Chiang troops were killed or captured. The next day (26th), there was no change on the front line from morning to night, only a few Chiang planes blindly strafed and bombed from the air. In the evening, the New Fourth Army launched another counterattack, and after two hours of fierce fighting, annihilated over 1,200 remaining troops of the 57th Brigade of the 74th Division of Chiang's army on the north bank of the silted Yellow River滩. Only the 192nd Brigade of the 28th Division fled south, and is now being surrounded and annihilated by the New Fourth Army, which recovered Shunheji. The Lianshui defense battle, after eight days and nights of intense fighting, is nearing its end.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: Special correspondent Sima Long reports from the Lianshui front: "Don't Let Them Cross the Silted Yellow River" - A scene from the Lianshui annihilation battle: Chiang's troops must cross a silted Yellow River to attack Lianshui City. They were obviously well prepared - wooden rafts, ropes, punting poles, all the tools for crossing the river were complete. Before crossing the river, a burst of machine guns, a barrage of artillery, and then another burst of machine guns silenced the vast wilderness on the opposite bank in the autumn wind. Then Chiang's troops, whole regiments and battalions, crowded onto the wooden rafts and advanced "majestically." The New Fourth Army did not sleep. They lay in the river defense fortifications, calmly monitoring the enemy's actions. When the wooden rafts reached the center of the Yellow River, hundreds of machine guns fired together, a rain of bullets flying and hitting their targets. A few minutes later, the rafts were still rafts, but they no longer had living people standing on them, but dead bodies lying there, stained with blood, leaving behind the arrogant but shameful traces of Chiang's army. The water of the silted Yellow River continued to flow, and都都地流着.

Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 27th: The New Fourth Army in Dongtai resisted the invaders for half a day, inflicting more than 2,000 casualties on Chiang's troops, and actively withdrew from Dongtai City at 11 pm on the 26th.

　　天堑淤黄河过来回不去
    涟水前线我再歼敌三千
    进犯蒋军四个旅全部溃败战事近结束
    【新华社华中廿七日电】经过八大连续激战，三路进犯涟水之蒋军四个旅（原师）已全部溃败，七千余人就歼。至此蒋军以一个月时间所准备的对苏北中心地区的强大攻势，已为新四军野战劲旅所粉碎。现淤黄河以北已无蒋军踪迹，河南茭茭镇以西钦工镇以东少数残余蒋军，正在新四军包围歼灭中。此次战役自十九日起，蒋军以七十四师（原军）三旅之众分路进扑涟水，遭新四军猛烈反击，于二十三、二十四日歼灭其四千余，二十五日蒋军以二十八师一二九旅增援，配合七十四师残部，再行反扑，新四军一部以神速动作插入蒋军的后方，二十四日黄昏收复淮阴东五里之顺河集，将进犯蒋军后路切断，涟水守军即配合再向进犯军反击，将蒋军驱逐至城西南黄河沙滩上加以聚歼，二十五日夜毙俘蒋军近两千名。次日（二十六日）自晨至晚前线无变化，仅有蒋机数架凌空作盲目扫射轰炸。入晚新四军再起反击，激战两小时，当将蒋军七十四师五十七旅残部一千二百余人歼灭于淤黄河滩北岸，仅二十八师一九二旅南窜，亦正被收复顺河集之新四军包围聚歼中。涟水保卫战经八昼夜激烈战斗至此已近结束。
    【新华社华中二十七日电】本社特派记者司马龙涟水前线报导：“不让他们渡淤黄河”——涟水歼灭战的一个镜头：蒋军进攻涟水城，必须渡过一条淤黄河。他们显然有过充分的准备——木排、绳子、撑篙，所有渡河的工具一应俱全。渡河之前，一阵机枪，一阵排炮，再一阵机枪，对岸广阔的原野上，秋风萧瑟，鸦雀无声，于是蒋军整团整营压在木排上“浩荡”前进。新四军没有睡觉，他们伏在河防的工事里，沉着地监视着对方的行动，待木排渡至黄水中央，几百挺机枪一齐发射，弹雨飞舞，点点命中。几分钟后，木排依旧是木排，但上面已不是站着活人，而是躺着的死尸，血印斑斑，遗下去蒋家军傲慢的然而是可耻的痕迹。淤黄河之水，依然都都地流着。
    【新华社华中二十七日电】东台新四军阻击进犯者达半日之久，先后予蒋军以二千余人之杀伤，已于二十六日晚十一时主动撤出东台城。
