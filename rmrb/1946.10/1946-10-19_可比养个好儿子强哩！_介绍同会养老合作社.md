    ——Introducing the Tonghui Old-Age Cooperative

    In Tonghui, there were forty-five elderly men and women with no one to rely on. In the past, they were people who only ate and didn't work, so the people called them "bottomless pits" and ignored them.
    In August, when the village was carrying out the "land to the tiller" movement, the cadres were extremely worried about this. Giving them land was useless because they couldn't farm it. Giving them food and money was a temporary solution, but what would happen when they ran out?
    After much painstaking research and discussion, they finally came up with a solution: to establish an old-age cooperative to support them with dividends.
    During the distribution of the fruits of the struggle, each orphaned and impoverished elder received goods worth 30,000 yuan (actually worth more than 60,000 yuan). They immediately called on them to invest in establishing a cooperative. However, the enemy's cooperatives had already taught them a lesson. Not only were there no dividends, but even the principal was gone. So, when asked to join a cooperative, they had many concerns in their hearts. Therefore, when investing, it was either 1,000 yuan from you or 800 yuan from me, and the most was no more than 10,000 yuan. Even so, some people did not invest. Hu Fuke was a beggar and was known in Tonghui as someone who liked to eat and didn't work (but he was only forty-five years old). He spent all the fruits of the distribution in a few days. After using it up, he begged again. He said, "Anyway, the Eighth Route Army won't let anyone starve to death, so what am I afraid of!" Therefore, he did not invest a single cent.
    The cadres felt even more that it was impossible to put the fruits of their struggle into production without establishing a cooperative. So, they patiently explained to them the fundamental difference between their cooperative and the enemy's cooperative. They also made a guarantee: food, drink, and clothing while alive, and clothing and a coffin after death, would be provided as usual, even if the cooperative lost money. As a result, some invested 10,000 yuan, and some invested 20,000 yuan. Yang Zhongcai's family, who was eighty-six years old, Yang Chengshou's family, who was eighty years old, and Yang Qi's family, who was over sixty years old, invested all of their newly distributed fruits into the cooperative. Qi's family said, "They give us everything, and even buy us a coffin when we die. It's better than raising a good son!" Some said, "The Eighth Route Army is so good. The little ones have nurseries (the military district nursery is in the village), and the old ones have nursing homes."
    On the third day, Yang Chengshou's family, Song Shenming's family, and others went to the cooperative to ask for grain and coal, which made the cooperative very difficult. But finally, they gave them a satisfactory answer, distributing fifty kilograms of grain and two baskets of coal to each shareholder from the fruits of the peasant association. Members of the peasant association helped them send it home, and they were all very moved, saying, "The Eighth Route Army is very practical! They mean what they say." Their investment gradually increased, and now the forty-five people have invested a total of 720,000 yuan.
    This old-age cooperative is managed by the village on their behalf, and they elect two representatives to supervise it. The money earned is entirely theirs. So they all say, "Our good times are here!" Therefore, those who can still produce, produce, and those who should save, save. They don't burn coal and go to the fields to collect firewood. Before, they ate half a day's worth of food in half a day, but now they eat half a day's worth of food in a full day.

　　“可比养个好儿子强哩！”
    史洪
    ——介绍同会养老合作社
    同会有四十五个无依无靠的老汉老太婆，过去是光吃饭不动弹的人，所以老百姓叫他们是“没底坑”，不理他们。
    八月，该村进行耕者有其田运动时，干部对此异常发愁，给地，他们种不了，给粮食、钱，暂时可以，可是吃用完了又怎么办呢？
    经大家苦心研究讨论，终于想出了一个办法，这就是为他们成立养老合作社，用红利养活他们。
    分配斗争果实时，他们每个孤、贫老人分了价值三万元的物资（实价在六万无以上），并立即号召他们入股成立合作社。那知，敌人合作社早已给他们上过一课，不要说红利，连本钱也没有了。所以要他们入合作社，他们心里还有很多的顾虑，因而入股时，不是你一千，就是我八百，最多的也不过一万元。就这样，还有人没有入。胡佛科是个要饭的，在同会是出名的好吃不动弹的人（但他才四十五岁），不几天工夫就把分得的果实花完啦，用完后又要饭。他说：“反正八路军不让饿死人，我怕啥呢！”所以他分文未入。
    干部们更加感到不成立合作社，把他们分的斗争果实投入生产不行，于是耐心的给他们解释，咱们合作社与敌人合作社的本质区别。并提出保证：活时吃喝穿戴，死后衣服棺材，就是合作社赔钱，也要照常供给。这样一来，有的一万，有的两万，八十六岁的杨中才家、八十岁的杨成寿家、六十多岁的杨七的家等，把新分得的全部果实入了合作社。七的家说：“啥也给俺，死了还给买个棺材，可比养个好儿子还强哩！”有的说：“八路军就是好，小的有托儿所（军区托儿所住在该村），老的有养老院。”
    第三天头上，杨成寿家、宋什明家等便到合作社里要粮要煤，弄得合作社非常作难。但终于给了他们满意的答复，从农会果实里给他们每个股员分了五十斤粮和两筐煤。并由农会会员帮他们送回家去，这样他们都非常感动地说：“八路军就是讲实际哩！说啥是啥。”他们的投资逐渐增加，现在四十五人已经投入了七十二万元。
    这个养老合作社是由村上负责代为经营，由他们推选两个代表监督，赚了钱完全是他们的。所以他们一致的说：“咱们的时光就在这里面哩！”因而他们还能生产的就生产，该节省的就节省，有煤不烧，到地里拾柴火，以前一天东西吃半天，现在半天东西就吃一天。
