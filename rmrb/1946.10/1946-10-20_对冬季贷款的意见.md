　　Opinions on Winter Loans
    Shen Fazhang
    Based on past experience, the following issues should be noted in this winter's loan work:
    I. In terms of timing: "Loans should be given to the masses as early as possible to prevent delays. For example, last year, winter production had already passed, and some people had not yet received loans. Others, because they received loans late, diverted the loans to other uses, so the loans did not play their due role. Secondly, loan collection should meet the seasonal needs of the masses, and the collection time should be determined according to seasonal needs. For example, if weaving, cooperation, etc., in December are in need of loans, and we collect loans, this will be out of touch with the actual needs of the masses. Therefore, the timing and amount of loan collection should be flexible to adapt to the characteristics of the dispersed rural masses and poor peasants. It is best not to stipulate a fixed time, and avoid the method of 'collecting when due and not collecting when not due.' The masses reflect: 'If you have money to pay, they don't want it, which is either a waste or used for other items. If you don't have money and they want it, you have to sell things cheaply.' Therefore, we should 'lend in bulk and collect in installments, calculate interest daily, and lend and collect at any time.' This spring, Xiangyuan used this method and recovered 2.07 million yuan of loans in 35 days, and the masses felt it was very good.
    II. In terms of use, it should be combined with production plans and various tasks. Loans should be issued with a focus on organizing mass production, controlling the use of loans, and preventing simple top-down distribution, which is completed in a rush and then everything is fine. As a result, the masses take the loans and either eat and drink extravagantly or engage in speculation. This spring and in the past, loans were issued based on the actual difficulties in production, combining mass capital to organize blacksmith shops and jointly buy livestock, which solved the difficulties of agricultural tools and animal power, and ensured the proper use of agricultural loans.
    III. In terms of procedures, we should strive for simplicity. We should do more publicity and explanation so that cadres and the masses understand. As a villager said: "If you don't borrow, you can't produce. If you borrow! The procedures are always not working." As a result, the role of loans is greatly affected by the procedural issues.
    IV. We must pay close attention to inspection and summary and combine them with loan disbursement and collection; for example, in a county's thirteenth district, the spring plowing was completed, and the spring plowing loans were still properly kept in the district. A county's sixth district loaned 220,000 yuan and loaned 180,000 yuan to the district credit cooperative. The reason is that the masses do not lend, so they have to lend themselves to avoid paying interest for nothing. After the problem was discovered, it was out of date, and it was dealt with casually. Secondly, there is no good summary and exchange of experience, so the mistakes are lightly let go. Often, "old diseases relapse, and you can only sigh." Therefore, this year, the four should be combined to carry out timely inspection and summary, timely exchange of experience, and correction of shortcomings.
    V. Pay attention to the transfer of cadres. District construction assistants and village production committee members who also serve as civil affairs officers must clarify the procedures and make explanations when transferring. This spring, in some areas, because the cadres were transferred, the bank comrades went to collect the money, not to mention calculating the interest, even the loan households could not be found.

　　对冬季贷款的意见
    申法彰
    根据以往经验，今冬的贷款工作，应注意以下几个问题：
    一、在时间上：“要早贷到群众手里，防止过晚误事。如去年冬季生产已过，还有群众未得到贷款。也有因收到贷款迟，便把贷款的用途转移了，以致贷款起不了应有的作用。其次收贷款要合乎群众的季节需要，根据季节需要，决定收款时间。如十二月纺织、合作……等正在需用贷款，而我们收贷款，这样和群众的实际需要会脱节。因此，在收款的时间和数目上要灵活，适应农村群众分散和贫苦农民的特点。最好不规定死时间，“到期必收，不到期不收”的办法。群众反映：“有钱交，人家不要，不是浪费，便做了其他用项。没钱要，就得贱卖东西。”因此，应“整贷零收，按日计息，随收随贷”。今春襄垣用这种办法，三十五天即收回二百零七万元贷款，群众还感到很好。
    二、在用途上要结合生产计划和各种工作。有重点的从组织群众生产中发放贷款，掌握用途，防止自上而下的单纯发放，突击放完，即万事大吉。因此，群众便拿上贷款，不是大吃二喝，便是投机取巧。今春和昔，从深入组织生产中，根据生产中实际困难发放贷款，结合群众资本组织铁匠炉，合伙买牲口，解决了农具和畜力困难，保证了农贷的正当用途。
    三、在手续上要力求简便。多宣传，多解释，使干部群众都了解，如某村群众说：“不贷吧，不能生产。贷吧！手续总是搞不通。”结果常常因手续问题一误再误，大大影响了贷款的作用。
    四、在检查与总结上要抓紧，应和放贷收款结合起来；如某县十三区春耕完了，春耕贷款还在区上妥为保存着。某县六区贷了二十二万元，就给区联社贷十八万元。理由是群众不贷，只得自己贷，不能白出利息。问题发现后，即已过时，也就马马虎虎算了。其次是没有很好的总结与交流经验，所以一错再错的就轻轻放过去了。经常是“陈病复发，张口长叹。”因此，今年四者应结合起来进行，及时检查总结，及时交流经验，纠正缺点。
    五、注意干部调动。区建设助理员和村生产委员兼民行业务员，手续必须搞清，调动时要做交代。今春有些地区因干部调走，银行同志下去收款时不用说算利息，就连贷款户都找不到了。
