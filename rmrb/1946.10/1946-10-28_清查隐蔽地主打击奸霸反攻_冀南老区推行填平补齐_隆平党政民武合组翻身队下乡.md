　　Clearing Out Hidden Landlords and Striking Against Despots' Counterattacks
    The Old Jinnan Area Promotes "Filling in the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies"
    Longping Party, Government, Civilians, and Military Jointly Form "Turning-Over Teams" to Go to the Countryside
    [Report from our newspaper in Wei County on the 26th] In order to thoroughly resolve the farmers' land problem, the old Jinnan area is vigorously promoting the "Filling in the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies" movement to implement the principle of "land to the tiller." On the 6th of this month, the Guantao County Party Committee held a meeting to study mass work. Everyone unanimously agreed that the land problems of farmers in the four old districts—five, six, seven, and eight—had not been completely resolved. According to statistics from 101 villages, there are still 665 extremely poor households. Evil despots and landlords are threatening and luring village cadres and activists, undermining mass unity, creating sectarian struggles, and attacking and assassinating mass leaders. In 43 of the 195 villages in the five, six, and seven districts, the landlords' counterattacks have created sectarian conflicts in the villages; in 208 of the 262 villages in the four districts, the masses have not been fully mobilized. After studying the situation in various villages, the meeting proposed the following guidelines: (1) In more than half of the villages that have not been fully mobilized or have not been mobilized at all, feudal exploitation must be resolutely and thoroughly eliminated to realize "land to the tiller"; (2) In villages where mobilization has been relatively thorough and "land to the tiller" has been realized, a thorough inspection and cleanup should be carried out to smash the remnants of feudalism and quickly shift to production; (3) The problems existing in each village are different, such as clearing out hidden landlords, striking against landlord counterattacks, clearing up unsettled cases of fruit, and dealing with sectarian contradictions. Therefore, when the old areas carry out "Filling in the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies," the topics do not have to be the same; they should start from the urgent needs of the masses. The Longping County Party, government, civilian, and military systems have jointly formed "Turning-Over Teams" and dispatched them to various villages to carry out "Filling in the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies." This includes investigating public land and temple land, mobilizing the masses in large villages to take care of the poor masses in small villages, and thoroughly resolving the farmers' land problem. Other counties, such as Renxian, Yaoshan, Quzhou, Daming, Qinghe, and Feixiang, have also organized forces to launch a large-scale "Filling in the Gaps and Making Up Deficiencies" movement in the old areas.

　　清查隐蔽地主打击奸霸反攻
    冀南老区推行填平补齐
    隆平党政民武合组翻身队下乡
    【本报威县二十六日电】为彻底解决农民土地问题，冀南老区正大力推进“填平补齐”运动，贯彻实现耕者有其田。馆陶县委于本月六日集会研究群运，大家一致认为五、六、七、八四个老区农民土地问题还没有彻底解决。根据一百零一村统计，尚有赤贫六百六十五户，恶霸地主则威胁利诱村干部与积极分子，进行破坏群众团结，制造宗派斗争，打击与暗害群众领袖。在五、六、七区一百九十五个村内，地主反攻造成村中宗派矛盾的有四十三村；四个区二百六十二个村内，群众未经充分发动的达二百零八个村。会上研究各村情况后，提出如下方针：（一）发动不充分及未发动的半数以上村庄，坚决彻底消灭封建剥削，实现“耕者有其田”；（二）发动较充分，实现了“耕者有其田”的村庄，要经过细密检查清理，以打垮封建残余，迅速转入生产；（三）各村存在问题不同，如清查隐蔽地主，打击地主反攻，清理果实悬案，处理宗派矛盾，故各地老区开展“填平补齐”时，题目不必一致，应从群众迫切需要出发。隆平县党政民武各系统合组翻身队，分赴各村进行“填平补齐”，并以调查公地、庙地，发动大村群众照顾贫苦小村群众，彻底解决农民土地问题。其余如任县、尧山、曲周、大名、清河、肥乡等县份，均组织力量，掀起一个规模广泛的老区“填平补齐”运动。
