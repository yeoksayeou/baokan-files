International Briefs

    Comprehensive Report: The Japanese Constitution, based on the draft by Kijūrō Shidehara, was finally passed in the Japanese Parliament on the 7th. It will be promulgated on November 3rd, the birthday of the late Emperor Meiji. According to Tokyo democrats, this constitution is actually a constitution dictated by MacArthur.
    Tokyo Dispatch: The Socialist Party's newspaper, Minpo, reported on the 11th that the notorious fascist spy organization, the Black Dragon Society, has resumed activities. Press circles pointed out that this is because certain foreign reactionaries are attempting to oppose another Allied country and need to use the Black Dragon Society to engage in espionage activities on the mainland. At the same time, it is also used to suppress domestic democratic forces and plot the resurgence of militarism.
    Various News Agencies Report: Discussions between the Soviet Union and Turkey regarding the Dardanelles Strait, based on the Potsdam Agreement, have lasted for a month. The Turkish side has partially agreed to the Soviet proposals, but has rejected the idea of joint defense of the strait by the two countries. The United States has sent a note to the Soviet Union opposing joint Soviet-Turkish defense of the strait. A British Foreign Office spokesman also requested on the 11th that the Soviet Union and Turkey end their direct talks on the Dardanelles, and believes that under the Potsdam Agreement, any member of the three powers can directly talk with Turkey as the first step towards convening an international conference to revise the Montreux Convention. London diplomatic circles believe that this statement indicates that the British side advocates convening a conference of the signatories of the Montreux Convention as soon as possible, with the participants including the non-signatory United States but excluding Japan.
    Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party have decided to establish a Committee for Collective Farm Affairs. Under the guidance of the Soviet government, the committee will include thirty-nine representatives from republics, border regions, and provinces. Andrei Andreyev, Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, has been appointed Chairman of the committee.
    Paris Dispatch, 11th: France has presented notes to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, requesting the establishment of an international expert committee to form a judicial body to try members of four Nazi organizations, namely the SS, the Gestapo (secret police agency), the Security Service, and the leadership organs of the Nazi Party. The note states that there are sufficient reasons to believe that the SS and other Nazi organizations are war crime organizations. The note requests close cooperation in the search for war criminals in the four occupied zones of Germany. It should be noted that the International Court ruled on the 1st that the above-mentioned four Nazi organizations were guilty.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Mrs. Cripps, Chairman of the British United Aid to China Fund, and her party arrived in Chongqing by plane from Beijing at 2 PM on the 14th and will transfer to Lanzhou and Beiping for inspection. At a press conference in Chongqing at that time, Mrs. Cripps declared that she would go to the Liberated Areas on the 27th or 28th at the invitation of General Zhou Enlai to inspect the International Peace Hospital established with the assistance of the Aid to China Fund.
