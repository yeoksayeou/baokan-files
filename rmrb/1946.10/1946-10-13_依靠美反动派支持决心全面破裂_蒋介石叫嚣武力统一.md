　　Relying on the Support of American Reactionaries, Determination to Comprehensively Break Down
    Chiang Kai-shek Clamors for Unification by Force
    Xinhua News Agency Reporter Points Out: Chiang Kai-shek Can Take Yuan Shikai's Old Road If He Insists; The Powerful People Will Surely Fight to the End!
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, October 10th] Chiang Kai-shek yesterday delivered his three-thousand-word National Day memorial broadcast speech. A Xinhua News Agency reporter commented that Chiang Kai-shek's speech was merely a rehash of his sickening and already bankrupt "unification by force" rhetoric, throwing the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC) and the ceasefire agreement to the winds. He formally declared that all people's peaceful and democratic endeavors that hinder his betrayal of the country and his fascist unification are "rebellion" and "disorder," which "cannot be ignored" and "even more cannot be stood by idly." In a word, they must be resolved by force. Precisely because of this, he resolutely rejected the minimum reasonable proposals put forward by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for the realization of comprehensive and long-term peace, namely, immediately ceasing the attack on Zhangjiakou. He put forward the so-called "ten-day ceasefire" to specifically discuss the two demands put forward in Chiang Kai-shek's two-day memorandum as a final ultimatum. The purpose of this ultimatum is to take the opportunity to replenish troops and continue and expand the offensive, to coerce the CCP into accepting principles that completely violate the PCC resolutions and the ceasefire agreement and surrender, so that Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous dictatorship can be passed down for generations. Most notably, after the self-proclaimed "mediators" Marshall and Stuart "held continuous meetings" with Chiang Kai-shek, they openly came forward to announce this ultimatum, demanding that the CCP acknowledge Chiang Kai-shek's unreasonable demands. The double act of the US and Chiang is now clearer than ever. It is precisely because of the support of the American authorities that Chiang Kai-shek dares to make the final decision to comprehensively break down, dares to issue the ultimatum through the US side, and dares to make such an absurd speech. The nice-sounding phrases in Chiang Kai-shek's speech, such as "political solution," "avoiding conflict," and "peaceful negotiation," are nothing more than a cover for the entire conspiracy arranged by the US and Chiang. But the strength of the Chinese people has become unprecedentedly strong, their eyes are clear, and they cannot be suppressed or deceived. The delusion of unification by force was entertained by Yuan Shikai and Wu Peifu. If Chiang Kai-shek insists on taking Yuan Shikai's old road, then he can only do so. As for the liberated areas and the people of the whole country, they are determined to realize true independence, peace, and democracy. If Chiang Kai-shek does not completely cease the attack on Zhangjiakou, does not withdraw from all illegally occupied areas after January 13th of this year, and withdraws all illegally mobilized troops, they are determined to make persistent efforts to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, to realize the ceasefire order and the PCC resolutions, and to complete the legacy of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution and fight to the end.

### 依靠美反动派支持决心全面破裂  蒋介石叫嚣武力统一

　　依靠美反动派支持决心全面破裂
    蒋介石叫嚣武力统一
    新华社记者指出：蒋介石要走袁世凯老路就请自便，强大人民一定奋斗到底！
    【新华社延安十日电】蒋介石昨发表其文长三千言的纪念国庆广播演说。新华社记者顷评论称：蒋介石的演说，只是重弹其令人作呕的早已破产了的“武力统一论”老调，把政协决议与停战协定抛到九霄云外。他正式宣布一切妨碍他卖国的、法西斯统一的人民和平民主事业，是“叛变”与“祸乱”，“不能熟视无睹”“更不能袖手旁观”，一句话，必须武力解决。正因为如此，他才坚决拒绝了中共为实现全面长期和平而提出的最低限度的合理建议，即立即取消对张家口之进攻，他才提出了所谓“停战十日”专门讨论蒋介石二日备忘录所提的两项要求的最后通牒。这是最后通牒的目的，在于乘机补充兵力继续和扩大进攻，在于威迫中共接受完全违反政协决议与停战协定的原则向其束手请降，使蒋介石的卖国独裁统治可以传之万世。最可注意的自称为“调停人”的马歇尔司徒雷登与蒋介石“连续举行会议”后，公然出面宣布这一最后通牒，要求中共承认蒋介石的无理要求，美蒋双方的双簧剧现在再明显也没有了。正是由于美国当局的支持，蒋介石才敢下最后全面破裂的决心，才敢经过美方发表最后通牒，才敢发表如此荒谬绝伦的演说。蒋介石演说中所称的“政治解决”、“避免冲突”、“和平商谈”等等好听字句，都不过是美蒋布置其全套阴谋的幌子。但是中国人民的力量已经空前壮大起来，他们的眼睛已经雪亮，他们是压不倒骗不了的。武力统一的迷梦，袁世凯吴佩孚都曾做过，蒋介石如果一定要走袁世凯的老路，那也只能请便。至于解放区和全国人民，则决心实现真正的独立和平与民主。如果蒋介石不彻底取消进攻张家口，不退出今年一月十三日后一切非法侵占的地区，撤退全部非法调动的部队，他们决心再接再厉为粉碎蒋介石的进攻，为实现停战令与政协决议，完成孙中山先生和辛亥革命烈士的遗志而奋斗到底。
