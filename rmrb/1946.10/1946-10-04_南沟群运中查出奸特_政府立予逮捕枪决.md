　　Nanggou Uncovers Traitors and Special Agents During Mass Movement
    Government Immediately Arrests and Executes

    [This newspaper, Changzhi] In the raging land reform movement, Zhang Laiyi and Gao Shazi, traitors, special agents, and murderers, were uncovered in Nanggou Village, Zanhuang. After a joint public trial by the masses of seven villages, the government accepted the demands of the masses and executed the two villains by firing squad, greatly satisfying the people. Zhang Laiyi was a local tyrant landlord in Nanggou, who ruled the village even before the War of Resistance. After the incident, he joined the Kuomintang secret service. After Zanhuang fell, he served as the puppet village chief, exploiting the masses and brutally murdering anti-Japanese cadres and their families. Zhang once colluded with the notorious ruffian Gao Shazi, gouging out the eyes of Gao Keke, the chairman of the village peasant association, and his son, burning them to death. Later, he raped Gao's daughter-in-law and beat to death Gao Qiu, a family member of an anti-Japanese soldier. After Zanhuang was liberated last year, this villain pretended to be active, secretly occupying the position of financial committee member of the village, suppressing the masses' efforts to turn the tables, and orchestrating the defection of militiamen and their weapons to the enemy. Because the masses had not been mobilized, the two villains were able to run rampant for a time. Recently, district cadres went deep among the masses, leading everyone to turn the tables. The masses successively accused the two villains of their crimes. The government immediately arrested them and, after a joint public trial by the masses of seven villages, executed them by firing squad. The government also announced the confiscation of their property to provide relief to the families of the victims.

　　南沟群运中查出奸特
    政府立予逮捕枪决
    【本报长治讯】在如火如荼的翻身运动中，赞皇南沟村查出汉奸特务杀人犯张来意、高傻子。经七村群众联合公审，政府接受群众要求，将两逆枪决，人心大快。张来意为南沟恶霸地主，抗战前即统治该村，事变后参加国民党特务组织，赞皇沦陷后，任该村伪保长，压榨群众，残杀抗日干部与抗属。张曾勾结绰号“脂里坏”之恶霸高傻子，将该村农会主席高可在父子剜去眼睛，用火烧死，后又强奸高之儿媳，打死抗属高秋。去年赞皇解放后，该逆假作积极，窃居该村财政委员职位，镇压群众翻身，并活动民兵拐枪投敌。由于群众未经发动，致两逆得仍猖獗一时，日前区干部深入群众，领导大家翻身，群众纷纷控诉两逆罪行，政府即将其逮捕，经七村群众联合公审枪决，政府并宣布没收其家产，救济被害家属。
