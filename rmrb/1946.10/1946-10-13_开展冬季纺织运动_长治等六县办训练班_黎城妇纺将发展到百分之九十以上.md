　　Launching the Winter Textile Movement
    Changzhi and Six Other Counties Hold Training Classes
    Women's Textile Production in Licheng to Exceed Ninety Percent
    [Report from this newspaper in Changzhi on the 10th] The county federations of Changzhi, Licheng, Xiangyuan, Huguan, Pingshun, and Lucheng counties are currently actively preparing to establish factories and run textile training classes, preparing to launch a large-scale winter textile movement. The Changzhi City Cooperative General Office has specially purchased a large number of cotton gins and blowers from Handan with a million in capital, which will be sold to the counties at low prices. The textile training class run by the Xiangyuan County Federation has a total of thirty women, who have now graduated. The federation recently held a joint meeting of cooperative managers, women's rescue chairpersons, and textile heroes from various villages to study how to carry out textile work in the newly liberated areas, improve technology, and weave mainline cloth and wide-width cloth. The Licheng County Federation's preparations for establishing a larger-scale textile factory are nearing completion. The first phase of the Huguan County Federation's textile training class, with twenty-four people, has returned to various villages in the newly liberated areas to guide textile work, and the second phase, with more than twenty people, is currently in training. All seven districts in Pingshun have textile training classes, as well as factories manufacturing looms, spinning wheels, shuttles, and steel heddles and other textile tools.
    [Another Report] There are currently more than 28,800 women textile workers in the four counties of Pingshun, Huguan, Licheng, and Changzhi. In Licheng, women textile workers account for more than 90% of the county's female population, and there will be even more widespread development this winter. The problem of clothing for the various counties in Shangdang, which used to rely on imports of cloth, will be completely solved.
