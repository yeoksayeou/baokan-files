　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. Shanghai report: Twenty-two people's organizations, including the Chongqing People's Peace Promotion Association, jointly telegraphed the United Nations Security Council, British Prime Minister Attlee, and Chairman Stalin on the 1st, requesting the fulfillment of the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference announcement, investigating American military atrocities in China, stopping the imperialist policies pursued by the United States in China, and declaring that the Chinese representatives to the Security Council, such as Xia Jinlin, are representatives of the Kuomintang party and cannot represent Chinese public opinion. Their original telegram to the UN Security Council stated: "The United States government, in violation of the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference, is openly pursuing an imperialist policy towards China. First, it is extensively equipping, training, and transporting political party armies to carry out large-scale civil war; second, it is illegally extending the Lend-Lease Act to supply a large amount of war materials to a one-party government; third, it is stationing troops in China for a long time, destroying China's territorial integrity, and threatening world peace; fourth, it is allowing U.S. troops stationed in China to rape women, snipe at students, and brutally kill workers and peasants; fifth, it is helping a one-party government to secretly establish a huge and abnormal fascist secret service terror network; thus, the Chinese civil war has become uncontrollable, and the normal life and peaceful trade of people of all countries in China have been greatly harmed." The telegram also stated: "The United Nations Security Council has the responsibility to abide by the United Nations Charter and consolidate world peace, and cannot turn a blind eye to the above-mentioned actions of the U.S. government. Therefore, we hereby request your council to take necessary measures immediately to investigate the number, defense areas, and activities of U.S. troops stationed in China, investigate the types, quantities, and uses of U.S. surplus materials sold to China, review the impact of the current U.S. government's policy towards China on China and world peace, and urge the U.S. government to immediately withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China and completely recover all war materials sold to China." The telegram declared: "The Chinese people all long for peace and demand the withdrawal of U.S. troops. This is related to the only hope of survival for China and the true will of the people. The sophistry of current government diplomats or party officials such as Xia Jinlin and Liu Wu Tiecheng, who have lost national sovereignty and agreed to the stationing of U.S. troops in China, can never represent Chinese public opinion. We hereby solemnly declare this." In telegrams to Prime Minister Attlee and Chairman Stalin, the groups, in addition to the aforementioned five major crimes of the U.S. government, solemnly appealed to the people of the United States, Soviet Union, and Britain and the British and Soviet governments to defend world peace, earnestly fulfill their obligations under the Moscow Three Foreign Ministers' Conference announcement, urge the U.S. government to abandon its imperialist policy towards China, immediately withdraw U.S. troops stationed in China, and completely recover its supply of materials to the one-party government and one-party army." The telegram pointed out: "The U.S. government's interference in China's internal affairs and participation in China's civil war will force the Chinese people to take various self-defense measures. The U.S. government should bear all responsibility for this." The twenty-two groups are the Chongqing People's Peace Promotion Association, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, the Chongqing Branch of the China Democratic Constitutional Government Promotion Association, the Chongqing Branch of the China National Association of Literature and Art, the China Association for the Advancement of Democratic Culture and Education, the Sichuan Construction Association, the Chongqing Branch of the North China Political and Economic Construction Association, the Chongqing Branch of the Hubei Construction Association, the Wartime Capital Youth Federation, the Chongqing Women's Federation, the Chongqing Magazine Federation, and the Life Education Society, etc.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 16th. According to Wenhui Daily: At the symposium of the industrial and commercial circles held on the second day of the "U.S. Troops Get Out of China Week" in Shanghai last month, the 28th, it was decided that the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles would initiate a signature campaign of 800,000 people, demanding a change in the current foreign policy and economic policy of the U.S. Truman government.
