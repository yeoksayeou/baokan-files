Xinhua News Agency, Shuyang, 27th: Under the rallying cries of "Defend our homeland," "Drive out the bandits," and "Follow the same path as the New Fourth Army," the people of the Huaihai region have plunged into a self-defense torrent of participating in the war and supporting the front lines. On August 30th, when the sound of Chiang's troops occupying Suqian reached Shucheng, the city's youth joined the war participation groups, and women also joined militia organizations, taking up large forks and kitchen knives to inspect pedestrians. The entire city has now organized hundreds of litters, dozens of handcarts, and thousands of porters to help with military transport. Old men are responsible for road repair and bridge protection. More than two hundred women have organized laundry teams, more than five hundred children have formed慰问团(comfort groups), and teams of loyal and reliable vendors are delivering vegetables and fruits in batches to supply the front-line troops. During the campaign, three thousand logistics team members from Si-Shu (Xin County) surged to the front lines, successfully completing the task of assisting the army. Stretcher teams carried wounded soldiers across more than two li of chest-deep water, holding the stretchers above their heads, filing through one after another. In the Yan-Shui-Gao-Gou area, more than 2,500 women, barefoot in the rain, carried noodles to the transportation station. In the Qian-Ji area of Shuyang, thousands of women ground flour for the troops in the overcast weather. In the Gong-Yong area, two hundred women braved the rain to rush and make cotton clothes for the soldiers in the factory.
