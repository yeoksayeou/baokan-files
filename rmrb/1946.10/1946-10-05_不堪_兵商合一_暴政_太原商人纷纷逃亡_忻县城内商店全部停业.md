　　Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 2nd. Last month, over two thousand Taiyuan merchants fled to the Wenxi and Fenyang liberated areas. In order to search for soldiers, Yan Xishan forcibly implemented the tyrannical policy of "soldier-merchant unity" in his occupied areas, causing merchants to resist by fleeing. Many merchants and shop assistants spared no expense to purchase travel permits and escape from the city. More than ten employees of the famous restaurant "Yi Tiao Long" were seized and drafted into the army, and all of them escaped, leaving only the manager behind, who was forced to commit suicide by Yan's municipal government officials. The once-prosperous Kaihua Market has seen eighty percent of its businesses close down. All of the hundred or so shops in Xinxian City have ceased operations, and seventy percent of the men in the city have fled to various villages. Prices in the city have skyrocketed, with millet costing nine yuan in silver dollars per dou and cooking oil costing 10,000 yuan in legal tender per jin. Residents are unable to maintain their livelihoods, and suicides by hanging are common, with corpses frequently found floating in ditches. Democratic governments in various areas are providing relief to merchants and residents who have fled from Yan's areas and are helping them to resume their businesses.

　　不堪“兵商合一”暴政
    太原商人纷纷逃亡
    忻县城内商店全部停业
    【新华社兴县二日电】上月内太原商人逃来文水汾阳解放区者达两千余人。阎锡山为搜索兵丁，在其占领区强行“兵商合一”暴政，故商人纷纷以逃亡抗拒，许多商人店员不惜以重金购买路证，出城逃亡。著名饭馆“一条龙”号十余个伙计，被抓到编组当兵，全数逃亡，仅留掌柜一人，被阎市府人员逼迫自杀。昔日繁荣之开化市，近来百分之八十商号都已关门歇业。忻县城百余家商店，全部停业，全城十分之七的男子均逃往各村。城内物价飞涨，小米每斗白洋九元，清油每斤法币万元。居民无法维持生活，上吊自杀者时有所闻，水坑中浮尸时常发现。各地民主政府正救济阎区逃来商民，并助其复业中。
