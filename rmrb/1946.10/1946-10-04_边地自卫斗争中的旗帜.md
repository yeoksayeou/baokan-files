A Banner in Borderland Self-Defense Struggle
    尹雨
    ××× village is only eight li away from Xiuwu city. Before the war, it had more than 70 households with over 300 people. After eight years of enemy rule and disaster, it was reduced to more than 30 households with over 100 people. After liberation, it has increased to 41 households with 154 people, owning 27 hectares of land. Because it is close to the city, it often suffers encirclement, attacks, and looting by the Chiang Kai-shek troops. The special agent organization, led by landlords Chen Yougui, Li Sancai, and rogue Wang Chunma, is also very strong. The masses' thinking about changing the world is also very strong. Chen Yougui and others used the influence of Xu Jingshan, the Kuomintang county magistrate, to constantly threaten and deceive the masses into maintaining the status quo. Thus, the masses in the village entered a tense and fierce anti-stubborn self-defense struggle.

    After Chiang Kai-shek's troops reoccupied Xiuwu for the second time in October last year, until the end of December, the approach to the village during this stage was "hardline." Militarily, encirclements and attacks by 20 to 30 people were frequent. As soon as they entered the village, they would seize livestock, clothes, and grain. The masses were very uneasy. At this time, the village chief ××× stepped forward and led the masses to resolutely struggle.

    In order to restrict the village chief's activities, the special agent Chen Yougui and others colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek troops to arrest the village chief's own brother and detain him in the city, demanding that the village chief make contact and negotiate conditions. The village chief pretended to agree, but once the person was released, he ignored them. He also convened a mass meeting to discuss countermeasures. By this time, he had already made contact with our army and became bolder. He resolutely notified the three special agent families who had fled to the city, giving them five days to return. If they did not return, their property would be confiscated. As a result, they did not return by the deadline, so he notified them again, "generously" extending the deadline by another five days. After ten days, they still did not return, so he convened another mass meeting and resolutely sealed their doors. From then on, he launched a sharp struggle against the stubborn elements and special agents on both open and covert fronts.

    In addition, the village chief mobilized the masses to empty their houses and move the grain to the base area. At first, the masses were skeptical and unwilling to move, so he and the self-defense captain and other cadres took the lead in moving, so that the masses could see. Under his influence, the masses also began to move. But there were still some people who were unwilling to move, so he suggested that he was willing to move anywhere, whether it was to the mountains or to the homes of his friends or relatives in the base area, as long as it was out of the village and away from the enemy. He also consulted with our district office and borrowed some large carts from the core area to help the masses move. Within two days, everything was moved away. The morale of the masses was greatly increased, and they said in unison: "We are not afraid anymore! We won't starve to death, we can do anything." When the Chiang Kai-shek troops came to loot the grain, they found nothing and returned disappointed. Later, the Chiang Kai-shek troops became more active, and the village chief discussed with the masses the distribution of the confiscated property of the three special agents to the masses. Through this work, the cadres and the masses became even more united, and the prestige of the cadres among the masses was also greatly increased. At this time, the troops lent the villagers ×× rifles, and the masses' courage to fight against the stubborn elements was further supported and encouraged. Then, they cooperated with the army in reconnaissance and recovered the ××× stronghold two and a half li away from the city, capturing more than 20 people. The masses' fighting spirit became even more determined.

    In order to remove this thorn in their side, the Chiang Kai-shek troops gathered superior forces to raid the village, and kidnapped 13 people, threatening them to maintain the status quo. The village chief consulted with the troops, requesting their help, and personally led the troops in disguised reconnaissance, going all the way to the Chiang Kai-shek sentry post before returning. At night, he assigned the village militia to each squad of the troops as guides, and he himself personally led the way. They secretly approached the village occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek troops, who had not yet noticed. They captured the family members of the Chiang Kai-shek troops and the self-defense corps who had come to the village to arrest people a few days earlier. The next day, they negotiated conditions with the Chiang Kai-shek troops: "You release one of mine, I release one of yours. You kill one of mine, I kill two of yours." Until January 13, the entire village was reunited again.

    The Chiang Kai-shek troops could do nothing about them, and on January 15, they sent the arrested Wu village farmers' association chairman to engage in activities. On the 19th, they sent another person, and on the 22nd, they sent a little girl, pretending to be visiting relatives, agreeing to clap their hands in the north of the village as a signal to welcome the Chiang Kai-shek troops into the village. The village chief detained these three people one by one. On the 23rd, the girl's mother came to spy under the pretext of looking for her child. On the 25th, an old man from Madaohe was sent to the village to spy, pretending to sell vegetables. Five reconnaissance missions were sent in ten days, but because the masses were strictly guarded under the leadership of the village chief, none of them slipped through the net. During the day, they organized women and children to stand guard, and at night, the self-defense team and militia were on sentry duty, and would cover the retreat of the masses in case of emergency. The Chiang Kai-shek troops tried every means, but did not succeed once. The Chiang Kai-shek troops often spread rumors, and the village chief often read newspapers and stories from the past to the masses, exposing the rumors. The Chiang Kai-shek troops exhausted their greatest efforts, but announced their failure in front of the masses.

    Before the Lunar New Year last year, the troops were stationed in the village, and the masses returned one after another. With the help of Instructor Wang Haoshan, the land reform movement was launched. During the current affairs education and the suffering of the masses, everyone's awareness was aroused. Tears of grief and anger stained everyone's clothes, and Instructor Wang could not help but shed tears from his eyes. After a period of reasoning and struggle, the masses of the entire village finally gained liberation. The land of the traitors was all confiscated and redistributed to the poor peasants. After appropriate adjustments, each person can now average nine mu of land.

    The relationship between the troops and the masses is also very good. They often help the masses carry water and teach the militia how to use guns, how to aim, and how to throw grenades and install landmines. After learning, the militia taught the masses. Now, almost everyone in the village, except for children, can throw grenades, regardless of gender. At night, the militia cooperate with the troops to guard, and the women tie grenades to the yard when they sleep, and extend the detonator on the door to their homes. In case of emergency, they pull the wire to raise the alarm, and the troops and militia will go to reinforce them. They also spread landmines everywhere, blockading the Chiang Kai-shek troops, leaving them at a loss. Therefore, from last year until now, the village has not suffered any losses.

    When the troops were about to change defenses before the Lunar New Year, the masses grabbed the soldiers' arms and refused to let them go, and were willing to take out the things prepared for the first day of the Lunar New Year to feed the troops. In order to respond to the demands of the masses, the troops re-stationed there until the relieving troops arrived before they withdrew.

    The masses of the village have awakened under the bloody rule and gunfire education of the Kuomintang, and have organized sufficient self-defense forces to meet the invasion of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are now persisting in the struggle amidst tense production. They have erected a model banner of democratic self-defense at the gates of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits.

　　边地自卫斗争中的旗帜

    ×××村离修武城仅八里，战前有七十多户、三百多口人，经敌八年统治与灾荒摧残，减到三十多户、一百多口人，解放后到现在又增至四十一户、一百五十四口人，土地二十七顷。因离城较近常遭受蒋军的包围袭击与掠夺，地主陈有贵、李三财与流氓王春马为主的特务组织亦很坚强，群众变天思想又很浓厚，陈有贵等便利用国民党县长徐景山的势力，经常威胁诱骗群众维持，从而该村群众便进入了紧张激烈的反顽自卫斗争中。
    去年十月蒋军二次进占修武后，至十二月底，在这一阶段对该村是“硬搞”，军事上二三十人的包围袭击经常不断，只要一进村，不管牲口衣服粮食一见就抢，群众情绪十分不安，这时村长×××即挺身而出，领导群众坚决斗争。
    为了限制村长的活动，特务陈有贵等便勾引蒋军将村长的亲兄弟抓进城扣起来，要村长接头讲条件，村长佯作答应，但人一放出来就不理了，并且召开群众大会讨论对策，这时他已和我军接上了头，胆子更壮了，就毅然决然通知跑在城里的三家特务，限其五天回来，如不回来即没收其财产。结果到期没回来，又通知他们再“宽大”他们五天。到了十天，仍然没有回来，即又召开群众大会，坚决地封了门，从此便与顽特以明暗两方面展开了尖锐的斗争。
    另外，村长动员群众空室清野，把粮食搬到根据地里，开始群众还怀疑不搬，他就首先和自卫队长等干部先搬，让群众看，在他的这种影响下，群众也就开始搬运。但还有些人不肯搬，他又提出，自己愿往那里搬往那里搬，不管你山上的与根据他的朋友家也好、亲戚家也好，只要搬出村，离敌人远些就行。并且和我区公所商量，借用了腹心区的一些大车帮助群众搬，不出两天便悉数搬光了。群众情绪大大增高，一致的说：“不怕了！饿不死了，怎么都行。”等到蒋军来抢粮，扑了个空，扫兴而归。后来蒋军活动更多了，村长又与群众讨论把没收的三家特务财产分给群众，经过这一工作，干部与群众更加打成一片，干部在群众中的威信也更加增高，这时部队又借给该村民兵××条枪，群众的反顽勇气更得到了有力的支援鼓舞。接着便配合军队侦察，收复了离城二里半的×××据点，俘获二十余人，群众斗志更为坚强。
    蒋军为了拔掉这个眼中钉，便集结了优势的兵力突袭该村，并绑去群众十三人，威胁其维持。村长便与部队商量，要求部队帮忙，并亲自带领部队化装侦察，直跑到蒋军哨位而回。夜间又把本村民兵分配到部队每个班里作为向导，自己亦亲自带路出发。偷偷摸到蒋军驻村，蒋军尚未发觉，于是便把前几天来村中抓人的蒋军与自卫团家属抓了回来，第二天便和蒋军讲条件：“你放我一个，我放你一个，你杀我一个，我杀你两个。”直至一月十三日，全村群众又重新得到了团圆。
    蒋军对其无计可施，复又于一月十五日，派被捕的吴村农会主席来活动，十九日又派了一人，廿二日又派一个小女孩，装作走亲戚，约定在村北地拍手为号，迎蒋军进村，村长把这三个人，一一扣留起来。二十三日女孩的母亲又借找孩子为名前来侦察，廿五日又派马道河一个老百姓装作卖菜的来村侦察，十天内派出五次侦察，但因群众在村长领导下警戒严密，没有一个漏了网。他们白天组织妇女儿童站岗，夜间自卫队民兵放哨，遇事即掩护群众退却。蒋军使了千方百计，但亦没有一次成功。蒋军常常造谣，村长经常给群众读报、访古，揭破了谣言。蒋军费尽了最大的心血，但却在群众的面前宣布了失败。
    去年旧历年前部队驻到了该村，群众都相继的回来了，在指导员王好善同志的帮助之下，展开了翻身运动，在进行时事教育群众诉苦时，启发了大家的自觉，悲愤的泪珠染遍了每个人的衣襟，王指导员也情不自禁从眼中滚出了热泪。经过一段说理斗争，全村群众终于得到了翻身。汉奸的土地全部没收了，重新分配给贫苦农民，经过适当调整后，现在每人可以平均到九亩地。
    部队对群众的关系也很好，他们经常帮助群众担水，并且教给民兵如何用枪，如何瞄准，如何打手榴弹安地雷，经过了民兵又教给了群众，现在该村群众除小孩外，不论男女差不多都会打手榴弹，夜晚民兵配合部队警戒，妇女们睡觉都把手榴弹拴到院里，门上导火线加长拉到家里，一遇情况，就拉线报警，部队民兵便去增援，并且遍布地雷，封锁蒋军，弄得蒋军手足无措。因此去年到现在，该村就没受到丝毫损失。
    过旧历年时部队要换防，群众抓住了战士的胳膊不让走，并且愿意拿出大年初一准备的东西给部队吃，为了答复群众的要求，部队又重新驻了下来，直到接防的部队来了，他们才撤走。
    该村群众在国民党血腥的统治与枪弹的教育下，已醒悟过来了，并且组织了足够的自卫力量来迎接国民党反动派的进犯，现正在紧张的生产中坚持斗争，他们在蒋贼的门户上树立起了民主自卫的模范旗帜。
