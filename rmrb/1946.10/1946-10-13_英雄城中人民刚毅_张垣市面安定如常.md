　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 10th. This reporter reports: Zhangjiakou, a people's city in the wartime frontier, maintains a prosperous market comparable to peacetime. Including the 190 commercial firms that have opened successively in recent months, the total number of commercial households in the city has reached more than 3,600, an increase of 708 compared to pre-war times, and an increase of 1,077 compared to the period of enemy and puppet rule. The recent bumper harvest of new grain in Zhangbei and other places has made the grain market here particularly abundant and active. The daily market supply of grain reaches more than 1,000 large shi (a unit of dry measure), with millet dropping from 170 yuan per jin (a unit of weight) last month to 106 yuan, rice dropping from 500 yuan to 480 yuan, and flour dropping from 250 yuan to 245 yuan. Prices of other food and daily necessities also remain stable or continue to decline, such as homespun cloth, which is still 9,600 yuan per bolt; coal is 3,000 yuan per 100 jin, a decrease of one-seventh compared to July; beef is now 560 yuan per jin, a decrease of 40 yuan compared to last month. According to the Yuanmao Foreign Goods Store, which the reporter visited, the total turnover in the week ending at the end of September reached 3.5 million yuan; the Yongfahe grocery store, which only has two storefronts, also had a turnover of 1.17 million yuan in the past week, which is more prosperous than usual. Before the Chiang Kai-shek troops launched a large-scale offensive on the Ping-Sui East Line, the exchange rate between the border currency and the legal tender was one to 1.15, but recently it has risen to one to 1.35. The price of red gold has remained at around 238,000 yuan for the past three months.
