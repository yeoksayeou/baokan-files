Xinhua News Agency, Ningwu, 1st: Under the call of the democratic government for "quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick storage," more than 500,000 men and women laborers in Huairen, Shanyin, Shuoxian, Ningwu, Guoxian, Wusai, Xinxian and other counties in the Jinbei New District are working hard to crash the autumn harvest. This spring, the New District increased the construction of more than 70,000 mu of irrigated land, with an average yield of two shi per mu, which is double the yield of previous years. Moreover, after rent reduction and interest reduction and reduction of public grain burdens, 90% of the families have surplus grain. In the above counties, the mountain oat crops have been harvested, and efforts are now being made to harvest millet, beans, and other crops. Shuoxian, Ningwu and other places have recently experienced sudden frost and snow. Men, women, old and young in the two counties are urgently mobilized and are working day and night to rush the harvest. In Shanyin and Shuoxian, 50,000 mu of millet have been harvested in one week. In the organization of rush harvesting, more than 100 people in the Ningwu and Xuangang areas have organized six rush harvest teams, which have harvested more than 700 mu of oat and millet for the families of troops and participating militiamen. The militia participation teams and work teams in the eight districts of Xinxian are armed to protect the masses in villages near Xinxian City to harvest the autumn crops. In order to rush to harvest the crops within 20 li of the city, the masses organized a large number of mutual aid teams, and transported the harvested grain to safe areas for storage. At the same time as the autumn harvest, autumn plowing and autumn sowing are being carried out everywhere. In the Xinguo Plain, in addition to turning over 350,000 mu of wheat land, the masses continue to turn over sorghum and bean land. In Loubanzhai, Dabaihui and other more than 30 villages in the third district of Guoxian County, the masses will expand winter farming and send manure.
