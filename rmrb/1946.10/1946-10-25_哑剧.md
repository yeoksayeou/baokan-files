Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd: The Shanghai United Evening News reported: At the end of September, the Shanghai education community held a meeting in response to the movement for American troops to withdraw from China. Someone gave a mime describing the stationing of American troops in China, divided into eight scenes: (1) America is collecting old clothes and shoes to send abroad. A lady donated a pair of high-heeled leather shoes. (2) The high-heeled shoes were transported to China and "relieved" a rustic farmer, who had no idea what to do with them. (3) He sold them to a junk collector. (4) A junk stall was set up in Shanghai, and a "salty girl" bought them. (5) The "salty girl" wore them. An American soldier got drunk and insisted that she take off her high-heeled shoes for him to use as a wine glass. (6) That American soldier was killed while participating in China's civil war. (7) His friend packed up his belongings for him and picked up the pair of high-heeled shoes. (8) The leather shoes were taken back to his country and into the hands of his wife. Oh! How could these be my own shoes?!
