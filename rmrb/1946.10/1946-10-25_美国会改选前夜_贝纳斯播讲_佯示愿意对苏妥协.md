　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd. Washington dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered a radio address in Washington on the 18th. According to advance news, Byrnes originally intended to report on the peace conference situation, but he instead focused on U.S.-Soviet relations. In addition to defending against Soviet criticisms of U.S. policy, Byrnes's speech indicated a willingness to seek compromise with the Soviet Union. Byrnes began by saying, "I would not be frank if I did not admit that I am extremely puzzled by what the Soviet delegation said about the motives of the United States. Not just once, but many times, they have condemned the United States for profiting during the war and now seeking economic enslavement of Europe under the guise of commercial freedom and equal trading opportunities among all countries in the world." Byrnes also stated, "Developing harmonious understanding is a necessary condition for making the United Nations a true world family. No country should unilaterally exercise threats and pressure to disrupt the determination of other countries' rights, nor can they arbitrarily resist or refuse to consider changes in relations between countries and nations as required by human justice, fairness, and enlightened thinking. We will continue to seek friendship with the Soviet Union and friendship with all other countries. This friendship should be based on justice and the rights of ourselves and others to different ways of life and opinions than our own, but we must retain our views." Byrnes believed that "war is inevitable only when countries cannot tolerate and respect the rights of other countries to different ways of life than their own." "If we are to build a 'path to peace,' then the idea that conflict is inevitable should not dominate people's minds." Byrnes also stated: "We know the pain and destruction that Nazi aggression inflicted on the Soviet Union. Even before the United States was attacked and entered the war, the American people supported the Soviet Union. Our people were allies of the Soviet people during the war, and the American people are willing to live with the Soviet people in friendship, mutual assistance, and equality during peacetime." Byrnes concluded by saying, "The American people extend a hand of friendship to the Soviet people, and also to the people of all other countries in this war-weary world. May God grant us the wisdom to seek the path to peace!"

　　美国会改选前夜
    贝纳斯播讲
    佯示愿意对苏妥协
    【新华社延安二十二日电】华府讯：美国务卿贝纳斯于十八日在华府发表广播演说，据事前传出消息，贝氏本拟报告和会情况，但他却以美苏关系为主题。贝氏的演说，除了对苏联关于美国政策的批评进行辩护外，并表示愿意和苏联觅取妥协。贝氏首称：“如果我不承认我对于苏联代表团说到美国的动机一点极为困惑，那我就是不够坦白。不止一次，而有许多次，他们谴责美国在战时发财，现在并在世界各国间商业自由和贸易机会均等的掩饰下，觅取经济奴役欧洲的办法”。贝氏又称：“发展和谐的谅解，乃是使联合国成为一真正的世界大家庭的必要条件，各国均不应片面的行使威胁和压力，以扰乱他国权利的确定，也不能专断地抵抗或拒绝考虑人类正义公道和开明思想所要求的各国间与各民族间关系之改变。我们将继续觅取对苏的友谊，以及对其他各国的友谊。此种友谊，当以正义和我们自己以及他人与我们不同的生活方式与意见的权利为基础，但是我们必须保留我们的观点。”贝纳斯认为“只有在各国不能容忍和尊重与他们不同的他国生活方式的权利时，战争就是不可避免的”。“如果要建设‘和平之履’的话，那末就不应让冲突是不可避免的思想来统治人们的心理”。贝氏并称：我们晓得纳粹侵略给与苏联的痛苦和破坏，甚至在美国被袭和参战以前，美国人民即支持苏联，我们的人民是战时苏联人民的盟友，美国人民平时愿与苏联人民在友好互助与平等的条件下相处”。贝氏结语表示：“美国人民向苏联人民伸出友谊之手，也向这厌恶战争的世界其他一切国家人民伸出友谊之手，祈上帝赐给我们以智慧与觅求和平之路吧！”
