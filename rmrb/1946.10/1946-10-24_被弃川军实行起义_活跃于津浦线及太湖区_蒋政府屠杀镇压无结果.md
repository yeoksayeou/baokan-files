　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 21st: According to the October 3rd Chengdu Huaxi Evening News, more than 100,000 Sichuanese anti-Japanese soldiers, decommissioned by the Kuomintang authorities, are stranded in various provinces, unable to return home, and suffering from hunger and cold. The Beijing-Shanghai Sichuanese Association requested the Sichuan Provincial Council to ask the government for relief, but Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered that each person only be issued a homecoming fee of 5,000 yuan. Given the current transportation situation, returning to Sichuan with 5,000 yuan is more difficult than ascending to heaven. Many of them have been forced to launch armed uprisings, with those active on the Jinpu Railway Line and the Taihu Lake area being the most numerous. The Chiang government has attempted to suppress them through slaughter, but to no avail.

　　被弃川军实行起义
    活跃于津浦线及太湖区
    蒋政府屠杀镇压无结果
    【新华社延安二十一日电】据十月三日成都华西晚报透露，十余万被国民党当局编余之川籍抗日军人流落各省，无法回乡，饥寒交迫。京沪四川同乡会曾要求川省参议会转请政府予以救济，但蒋介石手令每人只发还乡费五千元。以现在的交通情况，五千元返川比登天还难。内之不少已被迫实行武装起义，其中以活跃于津浦线与太湖区者为最多，蒋政府企图以屠杀方式镇压，但毫无结果。
