　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 10th: Beiping dispatch: The Kuomintang authorities in Beiping and Tianjin are encountering serious difficulties in conscription. According to the Beiping Xinsheng Bao, more than 100,000 people have fled Beiping in the ten days since conscription began, an average of more than 10,000 per day. The Kuomintang authorities in Beiping blame this on "the people's lack of understanding of the meaning of conscription"; but a Beiping rickshaw driver explained this "meaning" very clearly: "In the past, we ran from eastern Hebei to the rear to transport ammunition for the Kuomintang to fight the Japanese. Now it's to fight the Eighth Route Army, and I'll die before I do that!" The so-called "conscription" in Beiping is actually conscription personnel engaged in human trafficking. Some gold shops in Langfang Second Alley have been forced to pay as much as one tael (ten liang) of gold. A wealthy household, in order to find someone to take their place, used two taels of gold to buy off the Baojia chief, two taels to bribe the conscription personnel, and two more taels to find a replacement. An apprentice at a hotel ran away while being conscripted, and the conscription personnel returned to the hotel to demand 3 million yuan. The Kuomintang authorities in Tianjin, seeing the difficulty in implementing the conscription method, have recently openly decided on a "conscription and recruitment" method, which is equivalent to announcing the bankruptcy of the conscription method. Each district chief in Tianjin jointly set the "settlement fee" at 150,000 yuan per person, but in reality, most used 1 million yuan as an "under-the-table" recruitment fee, and it was still difficult to recruit anyone. The plan was to complete two-thirds of the total number by September 25th, but on the 25th, the municipal authorities were still asking the 94th Army Headquarters to relax the "acceptance standards," and the inside story was never dared to be announced.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th: The Kuomintang government officially announced today an order that national conscription will be implemented in all regions from today. Sources here point out that the Kuomintang government issued an order on September 3rd of last year, announcing that all national military service would be suspended from that date. However, this order was never implemented, and all regions continued to conscript as before. Especially since July of this year, the Chiang army has lost more than 200,000 officers and soldiers in the offensive against the liberated areas. Therefore, since September 3rd of this year, they have been frantically drafting and arresting people throughout the country. In Beiping and Tianjin alone, they plan to draft 80,000 people. Moreover, according to the army reorganization plan, the Chiang army will be reorganized into 90 divisions, and all the rest will be demobilized. But now the Chiang army still has 256 divisions, and today the Kuomintang government openly issued the above order to continue conscription. It is clear that Chiang Kai-shek is determined to expand the civil war and has completely destroyed the army reorganization plan.

　　反对国民党滥肆征兵
    平市日有万人逃亡
    蒋政府扩大内战下令全国征兵
    【新华社延安十日电】北平讯：平津国民党当局征兵已遭遇严重困难。据北平新生报透露：征兵以来，北平市旬日之间便有十万以上的人逃亡，平均每日在一万以上。北平国民党当局把这归罪于“民众不懂得征兵的意义”；但北平一个汽车夫却把这种“意义”解释得很清楚：“过去为打日本，咱从冀东跑到后方给国民党运军火。现在是打八路军，那咱死也不干了！”北平所谓“征兵”，实际上就是征兵人员在做人口买卖。廊房二条各金店竟有强迫征纳黄金一条（十两）之多者，某富户为觅人顶替，曾以黄金两条购买保甲长，以两条贿赂征兵人员，再以两条觅妥顶替人。某酒店学徒于征送途中逃跑，征兵人员返至酒店索款三百万元。天津国民党当局鉴于征兵办法之实行困难，近更公开决定“亦征亦募”办法，等于宣布征兵办法之破产。津市各区长曾共同每名顶额“安家费”为十五万元，但实际多以一百万元“暗盘”招募，仍难募到。此预定计划九月二十五日应完成总数三分之二，但二十五日市政当局尚在向九十四军军部提出放宽“验收标准”，内幕则根本不敢公布。
    【新华社南京十日电】国民党政府今日正式公布命令：各地自即日起实行全国征兵。此间人士指出，国民党政府曾于去年九月三日命令颁布所有全国兵役自该日起一律停征。但这一命令从未见诸实行，各地仍照要继续征兵。特别是今年七月以来，蒋军在进攻解放区中损失官兵二十余万，因此自今年九月三日起，即在全国各地疯狂抽丁抓丁，仅平津两地，即拟抽征八万名。且按照整军方案规定，蒋军整编为九十个师，其余悉数进行复员。但现在蒋军仍有二百五十六个师，今日国民党政府公然发布上述命令，还要继续征兵。显见蒋介石决心扩大内战，将整军方案破坏无遗。
