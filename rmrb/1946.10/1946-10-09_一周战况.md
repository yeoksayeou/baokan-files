Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 6th — The People's Liberation Army is gradually seizing the initiative in the war from the invaders, and the military situation has undergone significant developments in the past week. The Chiang side boasted of occupying Zhangjiakou before October 10th, but after launching a general offensive for a week, the Chiang army advanced only sixty li. When they reached the outskirts of Huailai near Zhangjiakou, they suffered a devastating blow. After three or two days of fighting, most of the fully US-equipped Sixteenth Army became war booty for the Eighth Route Army. The Sixteenth Army was secretly transported by Chiang Kai-shek along the Datong-Puzhou and Zhengtai railways in violation of the agreement. He thought he had succeeded, but today this army has begun to receive its due punishment. As news of victory spreads, the fighting spirit of the 170,000 citizens of Zhangjiakou and the 3 million people of Chahar Province is further heightened. In northern Chahar, the Mongolian and Han people's armed forces have annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek political bandits who had infiltrated from Rehe, capturing 113 cavalrymen, including the notorious bandit Han Desheng and others. More than 300 bandits from Wang Ying's bandit gang, sent by Fu Zuoyi, were also defeated by the militia when they sneaked into the north of Xinghe. Currently, Duolun, Shangdu, Guyuan and other places are under the effective control of the Eighth Route Army.

On the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, since the Eighth Route Army launched a full-scale attack on the night of the 29th, it has successively liberated four county towns of Dingxing, Xushui, Wangdu, and Rongcheng, as well as twenty railway stations and market towns, controlling nearly 300 li of the railway, killing, wounding, and capturing more than 10,000 Chiang and puppet troops. Seven strongholds in the suburbs of Baoding have been cleared, with more than 700 Chiang soldiers killed or wounded. Hundreds of thousands of militiamen in central and western Hebei are destroying the Chiang army's fortifications, city walls, and blockhouses along the line day and night. Currently, the Chiang side is hastily sending reinforcements from the Third Army in Shijiazhuang and the Ninety-fourth Army in Beining Road from the north and south, but the original defenses cannot be filled, which will create gaps for the Eighth Route Army to attack. The Ninety-fourth Army is the reserve army for the attack on Zhangjiakou. After this army moves south, the Chiang army suffering setbacks on the Ping-Sui Railway will find it even more difficult to obtain reinforcements.

On the Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning battlefield, the Eighth Route Army has taken the initiative and launched a wide-ranging attack on the Chiang army. Four companies of the Chiang army on the Pinggu Line were annihilated, and more than 400 people, including a battalion commander, were captured. Local armed forces in Sanhe, Xianghe, Jixian, Shunyi and other places recovered more than ten Chiang army strongholds and intercepted Chiang army transportation teams. In the second half of September, the main force of the Eighth Route Army launched 15 attacks, annihilating 2,500 Chiang soldiers. In the battle to recover Ningcheng, 2,500 were annihilated. The Fifty-third Army, the second line force of the Chiang army attacking Zhangjiakou, was effectively contained.

On the Hebei-Shandong-Henan battlefield, the Fifth Army, the Chiang army's earliest mechanized army, has been wiped out more than 1,000 people since entering the Heze area, and will suffer a devastating blow. The Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu militia, from Maojindu in the west to the outskirts of Xuzhou in the east, and to the Zhengtai line in the north, launched attacks everywhere, fighting 2,000 times in September, killing, wounding, and capturing 5,000 Chiang soldiers.

On the northern Jiangsu battlefield, after the Chiang army invaded Huai'an and Huaiyin, it advanced deep into the territory with isolated forces. The transportation lines from Xuzhou or Bengbu to Huaiyin were extended to more than 400 li, and the local armed militia threatened the lines everywhere. The Chiang army in Bengbu and other places is still moving towards Lianshui, Shuyang, and the Grand Canal, which is giving the main force of the New Fourth Army new conditions for victory.

On the Shandong battlefield, the Chiang army along the Jiaoji Railway is launching separate attacks. The Eighth Route Army on this line is constantly annihilating them by one regiment or one battalion. The Chiang army that attacked from Jimo was annihilated one regiment on the 24th of last month, and another regiment has been annihilated in the past week. A total of two brigades have been annihilated in the past three weeks.

　　一周战况
    【新华社延安六日电】人民解放军正逐渐从进犯者手中夺取了战争主动权，一周来军事形势有重要发展。蒋方吹嘘欲于十月十日以前占领张家口，但是在其发动总攻一星期以后，蒋军前进不过六十里；当进至张垣外围怀来近郊时，即遭受歼灭性打击。经过三两天的战斗，全部美械装备的第十六军大部分做了八路军的战利品。第十六军是蒋介石违约经同蒲、正太等路偷运至平绥线的，他自以为得计，但今天这个军已开始受到应有的惩罚。前线捷报传来，十七万张家口市民和三百万察省人民的战斗情绪更形高涨。察北方面，多伦蒙汉人民武装，已将由热河窜入之蒋介石政治土匪扑灭，著名土匪韩德胜等以下骑兵一百一十三名就擒。由傅作义派出之王英匪部三百余，当窜至兴和以北时，也被民兵击溃。现多伦、商都、沽源等地均在八路军有效控制中。
    平汉北线，自二十九日夜八路军全线出击，已先后解放定兴、徐水、望都、容城四座县城及二十个车站和集镇，控制铁路近三百里，毙伤俘蒋伪军万余人。保定城郊据点七个已被肃清，蒋军伤亡七百余。冀中、冀西几十万民兵正日夜破坏沿线蒋军的工事、城墙和碉堡，现蒋方正惶忙以石家庄之第三军及北宁路之九十四军南北两面增援，但其原有防务无事填补，又将造成八路军进攻的空隙。九十四军乃进攻张垣的后备军，该军南下后，平绥线上受挫蒋军，又将难于获得增援。
    在冀热辽战场，八路军已掌握了主动权，向蒋军展开广泛攻击。平古线蒋军被歼四连，俘营长以下四百余人。三河、香河、蓟县、顺义等地地方武装，收复蒋军据点十余处，截击蒋军运输队。九月下半月，八路军主力出击十五次，歼蒋军二千五百人，收复宁城之役，即歼其二千五百人。蒋军进攻张家口之第二线兵力第五十三军，受到了有力的牵制。
    在冀鲁豫战场，蒋军主方最早的机械化军第五军，自进入荷泽地区后已被消灭一千余人，并将遭受歼灭性的打击。晋冀鲁豫民兵，西自矛津渡起，东至徐州近郊，北迄正太沿线，到处出击，九月份作战两千次，毙伤俘蒋军五千人。
    在苏北战场上，蒋军侵占两淮后，孤军深入，自徐州或蚌埠到淮阴交通线均延长至四百里以上，沿线到处遭受我地方武装民兵的威胁。蚌埠等地蒋军仍在向涟水、沭阳及运河一线蠢动，这正予新四军主力以新的胜利条件。
    山东战场，胶济沿线蒋军正分头出犯，该线八路军不断地予以一个团、一个营的歼灭，自即墨出犯之蒋军，上月二十四日被歼一团，一周来又有一个团就歼，总计三个星期来已被歼两个旅之众。
