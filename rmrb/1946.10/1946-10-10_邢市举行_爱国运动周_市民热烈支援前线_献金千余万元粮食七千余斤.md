　　Xing City Holds "Patriotic Movement Week"
    Citizens Enthusiastically Support the Front Lines
    Donating Over Ten Million Yuan and Seven Thousand Catties of Grain
    [Report from our Xingtai City] During the "Patriotic Movement Week" from September 24th to 30th, Xingtai citizens enthusiastically donated money to support the front lines, totaling over 11 million yuan. In addition, they donated over 7,000 catties of grain and many daily necessities. At that time, more than 70 units, including various municipal organs, schools, cinemas, theaters, and commercial and civil organizations, organized propaganda teams to explain current affairs to the masses and perform various dramas, Yangko dances, and living newspapers targeting the current situation, which aroused a city-wide upsurge in learning about current affairs. Citizens said, "Today there is a second Wang Jingwei—Chiang Kai-shek—and a second Japan—American imperialism. We must persist in breaking their plot to turn China into a colony, just as we did with the first Japan and the first Wang Jingwei." On the 25th, a review of the city's militia was held. ×××× members of the people's armed forces stood erect in the square in front of the municipal government. They were armed; they had not only rifles but also machine guns and small cannons! They resolutely stated: "If any reactionaries dare to attack us, we will resolutely eliminate them!" On the 25th and 30th, all citizens held two patriotic demonstrations and parades. The ranks of millions of people shouted slogans such as "Crush Chiang Kai-shek's shameless offensive" and "Oppose the new Wang Jingwei and the new Japan." The donations also demonstrated the high degree of patriotic enthusiasm of the city's merchants and residents. Liheju Restaurant donated 40,000 yuan, and Manager Chang said, "The enemy and puppets didn't pay for meals, but the Eighth Route Army buys and sells fairly. I support them very much." Seventeen-year-old girl Bu Mengjing donated 2,000 yuan. She said, "I am very poor, but the Eighth Route Army came and turned things around for me. I like the Eighth Route Army." Yang Yuchun, a tenant farmer from Guaijiao Street, donated all of the 1.2 *shi* (石) of grain remaining after the year's consumption. Only after repeated persuasion from the masses did he change his donation to 4,000 Jichaio Yuan. Nine Polish Catholics also participated in the donation. Tongxing Li from Huashi Street donated 150,000 yuan, and Hengli Dong from North Street donated 120,000 yuan. (Song Hanmin, Niu Dengyuan, Liu Zhengyi)
