Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: Landlords who fled from various counties in Andong due to deceptive propaganda from reactionaries are now returning to their villages one after another. In Zhuanghe County, more than 70 landlords have returned and voluntarily sought out the masses to settle accounts and reduce rent. Zhao Yuzhang, a landlord in the county, said after returning: "When I fled, I initially had two thoughts: one was that I didn't understand what the Communist Party's policy was, and the other was that I heard the Central Army was coming soon and the Democratic Allied Forces wouldn't be able to stand their ground. Who knew that after living in Andong for more than a month, I saw that the citizens of Andong were very happy and the Democratic Allied Forces were very strong, which put my mind at ease." Liu Zhaofan, a landlord from Huanshan Village in Changdian District of the county, was deceived into fleeing to Shenyang, but then returned. He said, "Previously, I was deceived by people and thought the Central Army was orthodox. Seeing is believing. I took a lot of money to Shenyang, but it was all robbed by the Central Army. When I reasoned with them, I was arrested and held for five days. I also personally saw a big businessman take eleven catties of ginseng to Shenyang to sell, but more than six catties were robbed by the Central Army. Now I know that the so-called orthodox Central Army is actually a real bandit." He also persuaded the fleeing landlords Yu Xianzhang and two others to return to the liberated area together.

[Reported by this newspaper] Duan Erhei, a landlord from Gaoyi County who fled to Shijiazhuang due to the instigation of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, has returned to his hometown. During the mass debt clearing movement in Gaoyi in August, Kuomintang agents took the opportunity to spread rumors saying: "The common people are rebelling, if the rich don't run quickly, they will be in danger of being beheaded." Duan was deceived by this and fled to Shijiazhuang with money. However, he found that prices in Shijiazhuang were surprisingly high. Eating a simple meal cost two thousand yuan. Military police were frantically grabbing men for conscription and arresting "suspects". Every day, five or six corpses of people who had starved or been beaten to death were dragged out on the streets. Duan Erhei did not have much money, and it was difficult to find work. After staying for two months, he was at his wit's end and on the verge of starvation. Therefore, on October 5th, he returned to his village in Gaoyi. The village cadres immediately comforted him and introduced him to participate in production at an oil mill. (Xi Peng)

　　相信民主联军力量强大
    逃亡地主纷返安东省
    高邑受骗地主段二黑由石门返里
    【新华社东北二十三日电】安东各县因受反动派欺骗宣传而逃亡之地主现均纷纷返里。庄河全县有七十多地主返里后并自动找群众算账减租。该县地主赵煜章回来后说：“我跑走时当初我有两个想法：一个是不了解共产党究竟是什么政策，另一个是听说中央军快来了，民主联军站不住。谁知道跑到安东住了一个多月，看到安东市民都很安乐，民主联军力量很强大，使我放了心。”该县长甸区还山村地主刘兆范被骗跑到沈阳，又回来。他说：“先前我受了人的欺骗，以为中央军是正统。耳闻不如目见，我到沈阳去带了很多钱，全被中央军抢去了，我和他们讲理，被抓起来押了五天。我还亲眼看见一个大商人带了十一斤人参到沈阳去卖，被中央军抢去六斤多。我现在才知道所谓正统的中央军实在是真正的土匪。”他并劝说了逃亡地主于咸章等三人一同回解放区。
    【本报讯】受蒋特挑拨，逃往石门的高邑县地主段二黑，重返家园。八月份高邑群众清债运动中，国民党特务乘机造谣说：“老百姓造反了，老财不快跑，就有杀头危险。”段氏受此欺骗，即携款逃往石门。讵知石门物价奇昂，吃顿便饭，得花两千元；军警疯狂抓丁、拉夫、捉“嫌疑犯”。每天街上总要拖出五、六具饿死与打死的死尸。段二黑带款无多，找事又难，呆了两月，一筹莫展，眼看就会挨饿，乃于十月五号重新返回高邑本村。村干马上给以安慰，并介绍他到油坊参加生产。（希彭）
