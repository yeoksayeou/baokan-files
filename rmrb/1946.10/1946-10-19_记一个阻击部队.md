　　A Record of a Blocking Force
　　Jin Ren
　　Climbing on top of a tank

　　Our blocking force advanced to the enemy's retreat route on the evening of the 5th to wait. There lay an old highway.

　　At ten o'clock in the morning, dozens of enemy vehicles fled frantically like startled beasts. The following batch of vehicles also revved up their engines in an attempt to escape. Under the command to "hit the vehicles," the troops rushed straight at the vehicles like fierce tigers, firing at the drivers with machine guns, and using hand grenades to kill the enemy at close range. Warrior Li Sixiang was wounded, and Liu Hongyuan rushed up next, capturing thirty-one people by himself. The first attack destroyed two enemy vehicles.

　　"Send a small unit to hold Fan Yan," the warriors completed their mission according to the commander's orders. Because Fan Yan was a village on the side of the highway.

　　A heavier engine sound reverberated through the sky and fields. Here they come again, first vehicles leading the way, followed by tanks, and then infantry. After the commander observed clearly, he gave the order to charge. Vehicles and tanks, under the blockade, scattered from the highway and circled around aimlessly in the farmland. Warrior XXX climbed onto a truck and was carried more than two hundred meters. Later, he suddenly remembered the hand grenade on his body. With a bang, the truck stopped. Doctor Zhu Fusheng jumped onto the top of a tank, opened the vent, and sent a hand grenade inside. The tank stopped moving. Zhang Qinrong, the deputy company commander who had attended the Hero Conference of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, also climbed onto a tank and destroyed one. Two more heavy tanks were destroyed by rocket launchers sent by the Chiang army themselves... The warriors demonstrated their bravery and resourcefulness in the face of the enemy's so-called armored forces, vehicles, and tanks. Thompson submachine guns were captured, crooked-neck machine guns were captured, and armored soldiers became prisoners. This time, lying before them were a total of six vehicles and five tanks.

　　Seizing Lüzhai

　　In order to consolidate the blocking line, this blocking force mobilized most of its troops to seize Lüzhai. The enemy stubbornly defended every house. The warriors shouted: "Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed; prisoners will be treated leniently. Those who do not surrender will be resolutely eliminated." Company Commander Wang Guoyu led more than a dozen warriors into a courtyard crowded with enemies. The enemy put down two crooked-neck machine guns and more than thirty rifles. The prisoners quietly pointed to the next door and said: "There are more in that courtyard." Wang Guoyu leaped over the wall in one stride and jumped into the enemy crowd. The enemies squeezed to the west like sheep seeing a wolf, shouting: "Don't shoot, we surrender." Two more crooked-neck machine guns and more than one hundred prisoners were captured.

　　Machine guns piled up in heaps, and there were also two anti-tank guns. The number of rifles was countless. The prisoners sat down in the designated courtyard, and a layer of tense smiles appeared on people's faces.

　　A burst of fierce gunfire came from the edge of the village. Thousands of enemies counterattacked Lüzhai. The warriors gathered the prisoners and spoils of war in the courtyard and launched a counter-charge. The enemy collapsed to the south of the village like a toppling wall. The heavy machine guns proudly and decisively swept. The defeated enemy carved out a large gap, and at least two or three hundred people lost their lives.

　　Airplanes—American imperialist aid to Chiang Kai-shek's fighter planes and aerial fortresses—flew from morning till night. At one o'clock in the afternoon, the number increased from one or two to seven to assist in the battle, bombing and strafing at low altitudes as low as the treetops, attempting to pick up this group of beasts that came to ravage the liberated areas, but the attempt was always just an attempt. The remnants of the enemy made their final breakthrough from Dali Village but were beaten back by the blocking force. As the sun set in the west, the entire fate of Chiang's Third Division had come to an end.

　　Dusk enveloped the earth, the flames of the burning vehicles gradually extinguished, the gunshots became sparse, and the words of victory spread throughout the blocking force: nine vehicles, five tanks, two anti-tank guns, and countless rifles and prisoners were captured... We have controlled the enemy's retreat route.

　　One person captures a company

　　Zhang Shuyin, a teenage messenger, only requested to transfer from the cooking squad to the company headquarters as a messenger before this battle. He followed the instructor to Lüzhai in the morning, collected five rifles and a telephone, and lost contact with the instructor. On the way to find the instructor, he discovered several enemies running into a courtyard. He chased in. A vast expanse of yellow American uniforms strongly illuminated him. He calmly held his gun: "Don't move, our dozen or so regiments have already tightly surrounded the village. Anyone who runs will be shot. If you don't run, you'll be fine. Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed." "Follow me, and I guarantee you won't suffer." The enemies were stunned and followed Zhang Shuyin out of the courtyard. According to Zhang Shuyin's orders, they sat down in a low-lying area, and the weapons were piled up, covered with yellow tiles to prevent air raids.

　　Zhang Shuyin thought to himself: "There are no people from the regiment here, I'm leading more than one hundred prisoners alone." So he became even more calm and boldly worked on a telephone soldier, making everyone feel his bravery, kindness, and greatness. A prisoner dropped a bundle of banknotes hidden in his waistband, just watching it without daring to pick it up. Zhang Shuyin picked it up and returned it to him, saying: "Take it, no one wants private things. Don't worry! Don't be afraid." A prisoner next to him was moved and said: "If we had known the Eighth Route Army was so good, we would have surrendered long ago. Those damn officials are all talking nonsense and deceiving us."

　　Airplanes came, and the telephone soldier took out a set of yellow uniforms and draped them on Zhang Shuyin. The airplanes did not discover that they were already prisoners of the Eighth Route Army and passed by blankly.

　　No one from the regiment came, and time passed slowly. Zhang Shuyin was propagandizing and consolidating, making them feel at ease and preventing accidents from happening. It wasn't until dusk that he saw a team leading prisoners. He ordered the telephone soldier to lead in front, and he followed behind. The prisoners carried bundles of guns, walking towards another village. In the noisy crowd, he found the regiment's special commissioner and handed over the company of prisoners he had captured.

　　Squad Leader Jia Laughed

　　Jia Lanyou, a squad leader of the regiment's special service company, a young man in his twenties, was thinking just as the enemies in Dali Village were being wiped out: "The special service company also needs to change its guns." So, with the platoon leader's consent, he led four messengers into Dali Village. As soon as they entered the village, they captured six horses, leaving two people to guard them. The three of them continued to search the north-south streets, shouting loudly: "Surrender your weapons quickly. Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed; those who do not surrender will be resolutely eliminated." Someone inside the door answered: "We surrender... Don't shoot." Squad Leader Jia entered the courtyard, ordered them to raise their guns, and said: "You have been deceived by Chiang Kai-shek to fight a civil war. Chinese people don't fight Chinese people. Those who surrender their weapons will not be killed... We won't take your private things. Don't be afraid..." The prisoners accepted Squad Leader Jia's orders, put down their weapons, and walked out one by one. They said: "Your Eighth Route Army has a very good reputation!"

　　The prisoners formed a long line outside the door, a company with a sufficient number of people, and the weapons: more than seventy rifles, five machine guns, one American-made small cannon, three telephones, and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition...

　　Squad Leader Jia laughed! The messengers also laughed!

　　Cooks Hao Jiying and Mou Haiqing also captured two rifles and seven prisoners while delivering food to the front line.

　　Propagandist Su Wenchang captured one gun and five prisoners by himself.

　　The warriors excitedly discussed the miracle of victory and also discussed the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

　　"Chiang Kai-shek is our transportation captain. What he sent during the Ping-Han Campaign was not enough; it was not enough to use. This time, he replenished us again."

　　记一个阻击部队
    金人
    爬上坦克车顶
    我们的阻击部队于五日晚就进到敌人的退路上等候着。那里躺着一条陈旧的公路。
    上午十点钟，敌人数十辆汽车像惊散了的野兽飞快地逃窜出去。后面一批汽车也开足马力企图逃窜。在“打汽车”的号令下部队像猛虎似的笔直向汽车冲去，端着机关枪向驾驶兵射击，接近了的用手榴弹杀伤敌人，战士李思相负了伤，刘洪元紧接着冲上去，一个人俘虏了三十一个人。第一次打毁敌人两辆汽车。
    “派一个小部队把范岩扣住”，战士们按照指挥员的命令完成了任务。因为范岩是公路边上的一个村庄。
    更沉重的马达声响遍天野，又来了，最先是汽车开道，紧接着是坦克，再后面是步兵。指挥员观察清楚之后，下了冲锋的命令，汽车、坦克遭受阻击，离开公路乱散的在庄稼地里打圈子，战士×××爬上载重汽车被它带了二百多米达，以后，他忽然想起身上的手榴弹，一声轰响，汽车停驶了。医生朱富生跳上坦克车顶，他把通汽孔弄开，送了一个手榴弹进去，坦克不动了，曾经出席过冀鲁豫边区群英大会的杀敌英雄副连长张勤荣也爬上坦克，毁灭了一辆。还有两辆重型坦克是用蒋军自己送来的火箭炮打毁的…………。战士们在敌人所谓装甲部队、汽车、坦克面前表现了他的勇敢、机智。汤姆式冲锋机枪缴来了，歪把机枪缴来了，装甲兵成俘虏了。这次躺在他们面前的一共是六辆汽车、五辆坦克。
    夺取吕砦
    为了巩固阻击线，这个阻击部队调集了大部兵力夺取吕砦，敌人固守每一座房子，战士们喊着：“缴枪不杀，优待俘虏，不缴枪，坚决消灭”。连长王国玉带着十几个战士冲进挤满敌人的一个院子，敌人放下两挺歪把机枪，三十余支步枪，俘虏悄悄地指着隔壁说：“那院里还有”，王国玉一个箭步翻过墙头跳在敌人群里，敌人像绵羊见狼似的向西面挤着，叫喊着：“别打，缴枪”，又缴了两挺歪把机枪，俘虏一百余人。
    机枪一堆一堆，还有两门反坦克炮，步枪则数不清，俘虏们在指定的院落坐下来，人们脸上浮起一层紧张的笑容。
    村边传来了一阵激烈的枪声，敌人千余向吕砦反扑，战士们把俘虏、胜利品集中在院子里展开反冲锋，敌人如倒塌的墙壁向村南密结溃败，重机枪骄傲的独断的扫射着。溃败的敌人划出一个大缺口，至少有二、三百人丧失了性命。
    飞机——美帝国主义援助蒋介石的战斗机、空中堡垒从早到晚的飞着，下午一点钟由一架、两架增加到七架来助战，在低及树梢的低空轰炸、扫射，企图把这群来蹂躏解放区的野兽们接出去，但企图总是企图，残敌从大李砦最后一次突围被阻击部队打回去。日落西山时，蒋军三师的全部命运已经完结了。
    暮色笼罩了大地，燃烧着的汽车火焰逐渐熄灭了，枪声稀落了，胜利的话儿传遍了阻击部队：缴获汽车九辆、坦克五辆、反坦克炮两门、还有数不清的步枪和俘虏………我们已控制了敌人的退路。
    一个人俘虏一连人
    张书印，一个十几岁的通讯员，这次打仗前才从炊事班要求到连部当通讯员，正上午跟随指导员冲到吕砦，检了五支步枪，一部电话机和指导员失掉联络。在寻找指导员的路上，发现几个敌人向一个院子里跑，他追进去，一片黄色美式军装强烈的照射着他，他镇静地端着枪：“不要动，咱的十来个团早把村子包严了，跑出一个打一个，不跑没事，缴枪不杀”，“跟我来，保险叫你们吃不了亏”，敌人发呆了，跟着张书印走出院子，按照张书印的命令，在一块洼地坐下来，武器摆在一堆，用黄瓦子盖起来，以便防空。
    张书印暗想着：“没有团里的人，一个人带一百余俘虏”，于是他更加沉着，大胆的在一个电话兵身上做好了工作，使大家感到他勇敢、和善、伟大。一个俘虏把他藏在裤带上的一捆钞票掉下来，只是看着不敢拿，张书印拣起来送还他说：“你拿起吧，私人东西任何人不要，放心吧！别怕。”旁边一个俘虏被感动的说：“早知道八路军这样好，我们早就缴枪了，那些龟孙当官的，尽是胡说八道欺骗咱。”
    飞机来了，电话兵拿出一套黄军装披在张书印身上，飞机没发现他们已经是八路军的俘虏，而呆呆的过去了。
    团里没有一个人来，时间过的很慢，张书印在宣传、巩固，使他们安下心去又不致发生意外。一直到黄昏，他看到一个带俘虏的队伍，他命令电话兵在前边带着，他在后面跟着，俘虏们扛着一捆一捆的枪，走向另外一个村子，在人声噪杂中，找到了团特派员，交代了他俘虏的一连人。
    贾班长笑了
    团特务连一个班长，廿来岁青年贾兰友，正当大李砦敌人被歼灭的时候，他想着：“特务连也得换换枪”，于是经排长同意他带了四个通讯员冲进大李砦，一进村就缴了六匹马，留下两个人看守起来。他们三个人继续在南北街搜索，高声喊叫：“快快缴枪，缴枪不杀，不缴枪，坚决消灭”，门里有人答应了：“缴枪………你们别开枪”，贾班长进了院子，命令他们举起枪来，并说：“你们受了蒋介石的欺骗打内战，中国人不打中国人，缴枪不杀…………不拿你们私人东西，不要害怕……。”俘虏们接受贾班长的命令放下武器，一个一个走出去，他们说：“你们八路军，名誉好得很！”
    俘虏们在门外摆成一条长长的行列，人数充足的一个连，武器呢，步枪七十余支、机枪五挺、美造小炮一门、电话机三部、子弹万余发………。
    贾班长笑了！通讯员们也笑了！
    炊事员郝吉盈、牟海青到前线送饭也缴了两支步枪，俘虏了七个。
    宣传员苏文昌一个人缴枪一支、俘五人。
    战士们兴奋的舆论着胜利的奇迹、也议论着卖国贼蒋介石。
    “蒋介石是咱们的运输大队长，平汉战役送的不多，不够使用的，这回又重新补充来了。”
