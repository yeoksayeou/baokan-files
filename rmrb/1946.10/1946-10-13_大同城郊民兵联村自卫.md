Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 9th. The Datong suburban militia are universally implementing united village self-defense, striking at Yan's puppet troops who are抢粮 (qiang liang - looting grain). On the 27th of last month, more than 400 Yan's puppet troops from Datong and Shaling set out to Jie Zhuang (解庄 - relieve the villages/strongholds) and seize grain. On their way back, they were ambushed by the militia in the Baijiazao area, and all the more than 100 bags of millet they had looted were seized back by the militia. On the 1st of this month, more than 100 Yan's puppet troops from Nanda Temple sneaked into Dongluotuo Village to harass the people, but were again repelled by the combined militia of various villages.
