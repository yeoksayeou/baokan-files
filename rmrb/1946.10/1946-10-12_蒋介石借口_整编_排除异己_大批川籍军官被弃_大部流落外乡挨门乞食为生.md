Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 8th: Chongqing air dispatch: Chiang Kai-shek, under the pretext of "reorganization," has classified a large number of Sichuanese military officers as "redundant." Most of them are now wandering in foreign lands, begging from door to door. Some who wanted to return to Sichuan from Hunan were unable to board ships when they reached Yichang. Because military transport was urgent, all ships on the Yangtze River were requisitioned. They rushed there in groups of three or five, but were driven off because they didn't have tickets. On one occasion, more than a hundred redundant officers in Yichang, having nowhere to turn, ran to the Water Transport Command of the Logistics Department and surrounded its director, Tu Fang, causing a commotion for a long time, almost resorting to violence. Tu finally agreed to help out of a sense of camaraderie with fellow Sichuanese. In those few days, he managed to send back a batch of people by requisitioning ships and arranging for them to hitch rides on official vessels. But how could sporadically arriving redundant officers all get on batches of requisitioned ships? The officers all said, "The government has discarded us like worn-out straw sandals and doesn't care about us." On a certain ship, one officer said, "I don't want to be a redundant military corpse, I want to be a redundant military officer! I want to join the Communist army. If the Communist army calls me and gives me food, I will definitely go." This represents a psychological tendency among redundant military officers.

Not being able to return home is suffering, but returning home is also suffering. Helpless and without support, they have no food to eat. Some are still selling their clothes to make a living as winter approaches. On the streets and alleys of Chongqing, one can see many disheveled, homeless soldiers everywhere. Although the wartime capital has set up four officer brigades as places to "accommodate" these unemployed officers, the quotas are limited, and many unemployed officers are still abandoned outside the gates. The authorities originally set the deadline for registering unemployed officers at the end of May. Later, at the request of various parties, it was extended to the end of June. However, the extension order was held up by officers of the Central faction and was not announced until June 23rd, and those who came from afar arrived too late. One unemployed officer said that he had finally scraped together enough travel expenses to come to Chongqing from Guizhou. But when he arrived here, no one paid any attention to him, and he had to sell all his bedding and clothes.

On September 15th, the unemployed officers in Chongqing established the "Unemployed Military Officers Petition Group" to petition. As of September 27th, the number of registered unemployed officers reached more than 2,200, the vast majority of whom were from Sichuan.

　　蒋介石借口“整编”排除异己
    大批川籍军官被弃
    大部流落外乡挨门乞食为生
    【新华社延安八日电】重庆航讯：蒋介石借口“整编”将大批川籍军官划入“编余”之列。他们现在大部流落外乡，挨门乞食。一些想从湖南回川的，走到宜昌，坐不上船。因为军运正紧，长江面上所有船只都被封了差。他们赶到后三五成群的挤上去，没有船票，又被赶了下来。一次一百多个编余军官在宜昌走头无路，跑到后勤部水运指挥所，把该所主任涂方包围起来，闹了半天，几乎动武。涂最后以四川同乡之谊，答应帮忙，那几天总算用差船遣送和附搭差船的办法送回了一批人。但零星走来的编余军官，怎么都能坐上成批的差船呢？军官们都说：“政府把我们当破草鞋丢掉不管了。”在某船上，一个军官说：“我不做编余军尸，我要做编余军官去！我要当共产党军。如果共产党军队叫我去，给我饭吃，我一定去。”这表示了编余军官的一种心理倾向。
    回不得家是苦，回了家也是苦。无依无靠，没有饭吃。有的冬天来了还在卖衣度日。重庆街头巷尾，到处可以看见许多衣冠不整的流浪军人。陪都虽然设有四个军官大队作为“收容”这批失业军官的地方，但名额有限，很多的失业军官还是被遗弃在门外。当局登记失业军官，原定五月底截止。后因各方要求，延期至六月底。但延期命令为中央系军官积压，至六月二十三号始行公布，远道者赶到早又过期了。一位失业军官说：他好容易凑足了路费从贵州赶来重庆。但到了这里，仍没人理会，把自己的被子衣物全卖当了。
    九月十五日，失业军官们在渝成立“失业军官请愿团”请愿，截至九月二十七日，登记之失业军官即达二千二百余人，其中川籍占绝大多数。
