    Nazi Principal War Criminals Sentenced to Hang
　　The Nazi ringleader Ribbentrop and eleven other murderers were hanged yesterday. A few years ago, these murderers arrogantly marched against the people of the world; now they were tied up like dead pigs and walked to the execution ground, eleven corpses lying across the dirt of the Nuremberg execution ground. This is the inevitable and deserved retribution and fate for the executioners who oppose peace and oppose the people.

　　As for Hitler's accomplices, Papen and the other three, who were supposedly "acquitted and released," although the American reactionaries are doing everything possible to protect them today, the people of the world and all democratic countries cannot tolerate their existence. They can only be treated as "American guests" and remain in the Nuremberg prison. As soon as Hirt ran out of the Nuremberg prison, he was immediately arrested by the German police authorities. This shows that all human executioners, even with the protection of reactionaries, have nowhere to hide in the world, no matter how big it is. Look at the fate of these Nazi ringleaders! Let all the reactionaries in the world stubbornly carry out their evil deeds against the people and against peace! Even if they can be "prominent for a time," they will ultimately not have a better ending than Ribbentrop and his ilk; in the end, shouting "God bless you" will be of no use!

    纳粹首要战犯判处绞刑
    纳粹魁首里宾特洛甫等十一名杀人犯已在昨天执行绞刑了。几年前，这些杀人犯曾傲慢地向世界人民进军；现在他们却像死猪一样被捆扎着步向刑场，十一具死尸横陈在努连堡刑场的黄土堆上。这就是反对和平反对人民的刽子手们必然和应得的报应与下场。
    至于所谓“免罪被释”的希特勒的帮手巴本等三人，今天美国的反动派虽千方百计的要保护他们，但世界人民与一切民主国家是不能容许他们存在的。他们只能被当作“美国的客人”，仍被招待在努连堡监狱里。他们一跑出努连堡监狱，像赫特就立刻被德国警察当局所逮捕了。这说明一切人类的刽子手，虽有反动派的庇护，但世界虽大，却无容身之地。看看纳粹魁首们的这种下场吧！让世界上一切反动派它们一意孤行的进行反人民反和平的罪恶勾当吧！纵使能“显赫一时”，但终归不会比里宾特洛甫之流得到稍好一些的结局；到头来，再喊“上帝保佑啊”，也没有什么用处了！
