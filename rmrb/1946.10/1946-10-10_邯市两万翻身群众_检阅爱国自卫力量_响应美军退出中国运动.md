Handan City Twenty Thousand Liberated Masses
    Review Patriotic Self-Defense Forces
    Respond to Movement for U.S. Troops to Withdraw from China
    Deputy Commander Wang Calls for Full Support of the Front Lines to Protect the Fruits of Liberation

    [This newspaper's Handan dispatch, 7th] The 20,000 liberated masses of Handan City held a grand anniversary celebration of the liberation on the 5th. This was a review of the people's strength and a mobilization rally for the patriotic self-defense war. The jubilant and excited mood of the city's people has been replaced by unparalleled anger against new aggression and new treasonous civil war.

    In the morning, the city was filled with national flags. Huge slogans such as "Oppose treasonous, dictatorial civil war, insist on independence, democracy, and peace!" and "Defend the fruits of liberation, fully support the front lines!" were posted on the walls of major streets and alleys and on the colored pavilions at intersections. Countless liberated peasants, militiamen with guns, and self-defense teams marched in formation from areas 15 li (7.5 km) away from the city. They held high large portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, shouting excitedly, "We have suffered enough from the oppression of the Japanese devils, traitors, and despots. We cannot let them take away the democracy and freedom we have obtained!"

    Worker, shop assistant, citizen, women, and student-organized Yangge dance teams filled the streets. They denounced Chiang Kai-shek's crimes of treasonous civil war, and sang mournfully songs mobilizing people to smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. Handan merchants, who have greatly developed under the commercial policies of the democratic government, jointly issued a letter to all merchants in the city, calling on them to do their utmost to guarantee supplies to the front lines.

    At the passionate rally of 20,000 people, Mayor Wang called on the city's people to prepare for war and fully support the front lines. Deputy Commander Wang of the military region, the direct commander of the liberation of Handan, was greeted with thunderous applause when he took the stage to speak. He said very sadly, "…The people of Handan suffered painfully for eight years under enemy rule and enslavement. Who gave us these sufferings?" "Chiang Kai-shek's non-resistance!" the audience of ten thousand people replied in unison. When Deputy Commander Wang spoke of "…the Eighth Route Army, following the orders of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, liberated Handan on October 5th last year, and then repelled the Kuomintang army's offensive on the Matou front, enabling the people of Handan to be liberated and begin a peaceful and happy life," the shouts of "Support the Eighth Route Army in defeating the reactionary offensive!" echoed for a long time. Deputy Commander Wang then described how the army and people of the liberated areas had annihilated 25 divisions of Chiang's army in three months, and our area alone had annihilated ten divisions. He called with full confidence for everyone to (1) strengthen their confidence in victory, unite around Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, follow the Communist Party, and be confident in smashing Chiang Kai-shek's offensive! (2) Actively mobilize to support the front lines and strive for victory in the patriotic self-defense war. (3) Prepare for the long term, do not be arrogant, and be ready to meet the enemy's offensive at any time.

    Then, Director Feng of the City Salvation Association reported to everyone on the achievements of the mass liberation in Handan City over the past year. According to very incomplete statistics from only four districts in the city: the masses have recovered more than 4,400 mu (approx. 726 acres) of land, 2,864 rooms, and 15,910,000 yuan in local currency. The number of organized masses in the city has reached more than 12,300. He called on the liberated people of the city to protect these fruits, fully support the front lines, drive out the attacking enemies, and ferret out the bad elements hidden in the rear. Finally, the conference sent telegrams to the people of the whole country and the United States, responding to the movement for U.S. troops to withdraw from China. At this time, the whole audience stood up, raised the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the flags of "Oppose treasonous civil war," "Defend the fruits of liberation," and "Fully support the front lines," and the angry slogans continued for several minutes. (Reporter's Note: The Central News Agency has been broadcasting for days that Chiang's army has occupied Handan and held a "Welcome the National Army Conference" on the 5th. The conference was held, but it was not to welcome the "National Army," but to prepare a grave for the invaders to be buried in.)

　　邯市两万翻身群众
    检阅爱国自卫力量
    响应美军退出中国运动
    王副司令员号召全力支援前线保卫翻身果实
    【本报邯郸七日电】邯市两万翻身群众五日举行盛大的解放周年纪念大会。这是一个人民力量检阅大会，爱国自卫战争动员大会。全市人民狂欢鼓舞的情绪已为反对新的侵略，反对新的卖国内战的无比愤怒所代替。
    早晨，全市国旗飘扬；“反对卖国独裁内战，坚持独立民主和平！”“保卫翻身果实，全力支援前线”的巨幅标语，张贴在各大街小巷的墙壁上和十字路口的彩楼上。无数翻身农民，扛着枪的民兵和自卫队，一队一队从距城十五里的地区赶来，他们高举着毛主席、朱总司令的巨幅画像，激奋的高喊着“我们已受尽鬼子、汉奸、恶霸的欺压，我们再不能让他们夺取我们获得的民主与自由！”
    工人、店员、市民、妇女和学生组织的秧歌队挤满街头，他们控诉蒋介石卖国内战的罪过；悲愤地唱着动员起来粉碎蒋介石进攻的歌。在民主政府的商业政策扶植下得到很大发展的邯市商人，自动联合发出告全市商人书，号召全市商人尽全力保证前线的供给。
    两万人激奋的大会上，王市长号召全市人民准备战争，全力支援前线。军区王副司令员是解放邯市的直接指挥者，当他登台讲话时，全场掌声如雷；他非常沉痛的说：“………邯郸人民曾在敌人统治奴役中，痛苦的渡过了八年，这些苦难是谁给予我们的呢？”“是蒋介石的不抵抗主义！”台下万众一声的回答了。当王副司令员讲到“………八路军奉了朱总司令的命令在去年十月五日解放了邯郸，接着又在马头前线击退了国民党军队的进攻，才使邯郸老百姓得到了翻身，开始了和平幸福的生活。”台下高呼“拥护八路军打退反动派进攻！”的口号历久不息。王副司令员接着叙述了解放区军民在三个月中消灭了蒋军二十五个师，我们本区就消灭了十个师；他充满了信心要求大家（一）坚定胜利信心，团结在毛主席朱总司令的周围，跟着共产党走，有把握粉碎蒋介石的进攻！（二）紧张动员起来支援前线，争取爱国自卫战争的胜利。（三）应作长期打算，不要骄傲，时时准备迎接敌人的进攻。
    接着市救国会冯主任向大家报告了一年来邯郸市群众翻身的成果；仅全市四个区据极不完全的统计：群众收回土地四千四百余亩。房二千八百六十四间。本币一千五百九十一万元。全市有组织群众已达一万二千三百余人。他号召全市翻身人民保卫这些果实，全力支援前线，把进攻的敌人打出去！把隐藏在后方的坏蛋查出来。最后大会致电全国与美国人民，响应美军退出中国运动。此时全场起立高举毛主席朱总司令画像，和“反对卖国内战”，“保卫翻身果实”，“全力支援前线”的旗帜，愤怒的口号继续了数分钟之久。（记者按：中央社连日广播蒋军已占邯郸，且于五日召开“欢迎国军大会”。大会是开了的，不过并非什么欢迎“国军”，而是为进犯者准备着葬身的坟墓。”
