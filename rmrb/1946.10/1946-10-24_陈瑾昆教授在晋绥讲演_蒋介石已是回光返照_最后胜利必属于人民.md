Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 21st: The famous Chinese legal scholar Professor Chen Jinkun and his family of eight set off from Zhangjiakou on the 19th of last month for Yan'an. Along the way, they delivered speeches at welcome meetings in Yuxian, Lingqiu, Guoxian, Shenchi, and Wuzhai, denouncing Chiang Kai-shek's policy of selling out the country and launching a civil war. On the 13th of this month, they arrived in Xing County, and various circles in Jin-Sui held a grand welcome meeting on the 14th. At the meeting, Mr. Chen gave a speech entitled "Chiang Kai-shek's Death Throes." Professor Chen said: "When the sun is about to 'set,' it must first shine brightly before it sets. This is called 'death throes.' Or, when a patient is dying, his spirit will definitely improve, especially when given a 'cardiac stimulant.' This is also called 'death throes.' Although Chiang Kai-shek and a small number of selfish elements within the Kuomintang are very clear that there is no way out of fighting a civil war, that 'fighting will inevitably lead to defeat by the Communist Party,' they are desperately making a last-ditch struggle and betting everything in order to maintain their dictatorship and continue their autocracy. China has been extremely exhausted as a result of the eight-year War of Resistance against Japan. The people's livelihood is extremely depleted. In addition, the 'political corruption and economic crisis' of Chiang's regime, which has harmed the country and the people for twenty years, has created a situation of suffering unprecedented in Chinese and foreign history. We, the people, should immediately rise up and overthrow this corrupt government. However, the consistent aim and attitude of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party is to 'strive for peace' and 'oppose civil war.' But this is not because we are afraid of him, but because we are accommodating him. Last year, Chairman Mao personally went to Chongqing to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek and establish the Double Tenth Agreement. This is the spirit and action of a national hero unprecedented in history. Under the pressure of the national people's forces, Chiang Kai-shek reluctantly signed the Double Tenth Agreement and convened the Political Consultative Conference to establish a plan. But he had no sincerity to abandon his dictatorship and implement democracy, so he immediately went back on his word. First, he carried out civil war within the passes, and then he carried out a full-scale civil war. The situation the people are in now is exactly as the ancient saying describes the suffering of the people under a tyrant, which is 'like water becoming deeper and deeper, like fire becoming hotter and hotter'; describing the people's demand for liberation is 'like being rescued from hanging upside down.' We didn't feel how painful it was before, but now we are 'experiencing it firsthand and understanding its taste.' The people can't survive anymore. This is different from the time when we wanted revolution before. Before, only the poor couldn't survive, but now even the rich can't survive, and Chiang Kai-shek continues to fight a civil war. We, the people, hope that the Chinese Communist Party and other democratic forces will come to save and liberate us, which is even more hopeful than 'being rescued from hanging upside down.' 'Heaven helps those who help themselves.' I hope that democratic forces and democrats will rise up. Saving the country and the people is like rescuing from disaster, rescuing from water, rescuing from fire, and rescuing from hanging upside down. Although it is not easy, I firmly believe that fighting to resist dictatorship and fighting to defend autonomy, the final victory will definitely belong to us! Chiang Kai-shek will eventually collapse! He will decline, he will die! Although he has been given countless cardiac stimulants by the American reactionaries, the last one is the so-called 'sale of $500 million worth of war surplus materials,' he can still struggle for some time, and even occupy a city or a town at the greatest sacrifice, which is the same as the Japanese only occupying points and lines. No matter how fierce Chiang Kai-shek is, he cannot be more fierce than the Japanese. Their doomed fate is already a historical iron law!"

　　陈瑾昆教授在晋绥讲演
    蒋介石已是回光返照
    最后胜利必属于人民
    【新华社兴县二十一日电】中国著名法律学家名教授陈瑾昆老先生全家一行八人于上月十九日由张垣动身赴延，沿途于蔚县、灵邱、崞县、神池、五寨等地欢迎会上发表演说，痛斥蒋介石卖国内战政策。本月十三日抵达兴县，晋绥各界特于十四日召开盛大欢迎会。会上陈氏以“蒋介石的回光返照”为题发表演说。陈老先生称：“日头要‘没落’时，必定要先放光芒一次，然后才没落，这叫‘回光返照’。或者是病人在临死时一定精神转好，尤其被打‘强心针’时，这也叫‘回光返照’。蒋介石与国民党内少数自私分子虽然很清楚打内战是无出路的，‘打必被共产党打垮’，但他们为了维持独裁和继续专制，拚命的最后挣扎，孤注一掷。中国经过八年抗战的结果，国力枯竭已极，民生凋敝不堪，加以蒋政权祸国殃民二十年的‘政治腐败与经济危机’，造成了现今中外历史上未有的苦境。这种腐败政府，我们人民应立即起来革他的命。然而，中国人民与中共的一贯宗旨和态度是‘争取和平’‘反对内战’。但这并不是怕他，而是让他。去年毛主席亲赴重庆与蒋介石协商，成立了双十协定，这是历史上未有前例的民族英雄的精神和行动。蒋介石在全国人民力量的压迫下，勉强签订双十协定，并召开政治协商会议，成立一个方案。但他无诚意放弃独裁，实行民主，于是立即翻悔。初则进行关内内战，继则进行全面内战。现在人民所处的情形，正如古语所形容的人民受暴君痛苦的话，是‘如水益深，如火益热’；形容人民求解放的话是‘如解倒悬’。我们以前还不觉得如何痛苦，现在则正是‘身临其境，心领其味’了。人民本已活不了，这与以前要革命的时候还不同，以前只是穷人活不了，现在是富人也活不了，而蒋介石继续打内战。我们人民盼望中国共产党同其他民主力量来挽救来解放自然比‘解下倒悬’还要望得更甚。‘天助自助者’，希望民主力量和民主人士起来。救国救民，如同救灾、救水、救火、解倒悬一样。虽然是不容易的，但坚信为抵抗独裁而战、保卫自治而战，最后胜利是必属于我们的！蒋介石终久是要垮台的！是要没落、是要死亡的！他虽然经美国反动派对他打了无数次的强心针，最后打的一针就是所谓‘五亿美元之战争剩余物资’的出售，他还可挣扎若干时日，甚至以最大牺牲代价而占了一城一市，这个同日本人只占点线相同。蒋介石再凶，也不能凶过日本人。他们的死亡命运是已经注定了的历史规定的铁律！”
