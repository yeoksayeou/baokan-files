[This dispatch from our newspaper in the Jilu豫 area on the 15th] To enable new soldiers to fight the enemy at the front with peace of mind and defeat Chiang Kai-shek's attacks as soon as possible, the Taixi County government has specifically researched many preferential treatment measures for military families and proposed eight major guarantees:

	1. When distributing the fruits of struggle, it is guaranteed that poor peasant military families will receive land, and middle peasants will receive grain. Military families will receive more than the general public, field army families will receive more than local armed forces families, and families of martyrs will receive even more than everyone else. Villages with few fruits will be adjusted by the district and county from confiscated traitor land and rich village public land.
	2. Regarding clothing, food, and housing: The government guarantees a maximum annual subsidy of 150 jin of grain per person for the regular army. The masses guarantee to repair houses for military families, and poor military families have priority in the distribution of houses belonging to traitorous landlords.
	3. Regarding substitute farming: Military families can be exempt from stretcher duty, heavy labor, and long-distance labor. Those without labor at home will have village-organized farming groups manage it for them. Those with surplus livestock provide labor. Guaranteeing good cultivation. Villages with many military families and those with few can adjust labor.
	4. Regarding hiring laborers to join the army: If a hired laborer joins the army, the employer must pay all the wages and supplies due to the hired laborer for the entire year. Regardless of where they join the army, they will be treated preferentially in their village.
	5. The government will completely exempt military families from old public grain debts.
	6. Regarding debt repayment: In principle, debts should be repaid by themselves, with the village helping to resolve them. For families that are poor and have many debts, the fruits of struggle in the village will be used to subsidize and care for them, or repayment will be postponed. After the soldier leaves, village cadres should take on the responsibility for the debts and repay them after distributing the fruits. Those who have already repaid will be treated as advance payments of the fruits. However, creditors cannot force military families to repay debts when they join the army.
	7. Each village guarantees fair treatment for soldiers joining the army.
	8. Organize military family committees to guarantee the resolution of daily difficulties for military families, such as carrying water, weddings, and funerals.
