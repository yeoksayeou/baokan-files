Xinhua News Agency, East Ping-Sui Front, 4th. The unrighteous troops of Chiang Kai-shek, invading the people's city of Zhangjiakou, have suffered a major blow in front of the strong defense line of Huailai, 100 kilometers away from the city, with over 3,000 men annihilated. The Chiang troops on their right flank, attempting to outflank and attack Yanqing, have also suffered strong resistance. The city is still being firmly defended by the Eighth Route Army. On the front of the East Ping-Sui Railway, since Chiang Kai-shek issued the order for a general offensive on Zhangjiakou on the 29th, using the American-equipped 16th and 53rd Armies to launch a large-scale attack on Zhangjiakou along the railway line, they have been met with heroic resistance from the local military and civilians, suffering losses of over 800 men and making very little progress. On the 3rd, the 109th and 94th Divisions of Chiang's 16th Army, with unprecedentedly fierce artillery fire, coordinated with aircraft and tanks to pounce on the Eighth Route Army positions defending the east of Huailai City from Kangzhuang and Xibozitou. The fierce battle lasted from 6:00 a.m. until dusk, with Chiang's army firing over 3,000 shells. The commanders and fighters of the Eighth Route Army stood firm on their positions, fighting more bravely as they fought, killing and wounding over 500 of Chiang's troops. At 6:00 p.m., the Eighth Route Army turned to the counter-offensive, engaging in fierce fighting near the East and West Garden, 15 li east of Huailai City, annihilating the entire 325th Regiment and part of the 327th Regiment of Chiang's 109th Division. The main force of the 94th Division also suffered serious losses. In this battle, the Eighth Route Army killed and wounded over 2,000 of Chiang's troops, captured over 1,000 prisoners, and seized five tanks, three American-made anti-tank guns, two flat trajectory guns, many mortars (including two American-made heavy mortars), eight small-caliber guns, five anti-tank rifles, twelve heavy machine guns, over sixty light machine guns, thousands of rifles, and many other military supplies, which are currently being inventoried. From the 29th of last month, when Chiang's army began to attack the Zhangjiakou Liberated Area in Chahar Province from west of Nankou, to the 3rd, within five days, they have lost nearly 5,000 men, and advanced only 60 li. When they advanced to the front of Huailai City, a defended area of the Eighth Route Army, they suffered a major setback. The boast of some Kuomintang newspapers that they would "take Zhangjiakou on October 10th" has almost become a bubble. On the North Ping-Han Line, the Jin-Cha-Ji troops under General Nie Rongzhen are continuing to expand their victories with heroic actions after controlling over 250 li of the railway, closely coordinating with the Chahar Self-Defense War. Chiang's army has lost over 10,000 men on both lines.

　　晋察冀军民英勇保卫张家口
    蒋贼进犯军受创怀来
    被歼精锐三千余九四师主力被击溃我军缴获坦克五辆及大量美式装备
    【新华社平绥东线四日电】进犯人民城市张家口的蒋介石不义之师，在远距该城一百公里的怀来坚强防线前面遭受重大打击，被歼三千余人。而其右翼向延庆迂回进攻之蒋军，亦遭受坚强抗击，该城仍在八路军坚守中。平绥东线正面，二十九日蒋介石发布对张垣总攻令，以美械化之十六军、五十三军沿铁路线向张家口大举进攻以来，即遭当地军民英勇抗击，先后损失八百余人，进展甚微。三日，蒋军十六军一零九师、九十四师两个师复以空前猛烈炮火，配合飞机、坦克自康庄及西拨子向坚守怀来城东的八路军阵地猛扑，激战自晨六时起直至黄昏，蒋军发炮三千余发；八路军指战员坚守阵地，愈战愈勇，毙伤蒋军五百余人。傍晚六时，八路军转为反攻，在怀来城东十五里的东西花园附近激战三小时，将蒋军一零九师三二五团全部及三二七团一部歼灭，九十四师主力亦遭严重损失。此役，八路军毙伤蒋军二千余人，俘虏一千余人，缴获坦克五辆，美式反坦克炮三门，平射炮两门，迫击炮多门（内有美式重迫击炮两门），小口径炮八门，反坦克枪五枝，重机枪十二挺，轻机枪六十余挺，步枪数千枝，其他军用品甚多，正清查中。按蒋军于上月二十九日开始自南口以西向察省张家口解放区进攻，至三日止，五日内已损失近五千人，而前进不过六十里。当其进至八路军设防地带之怀来城前，即受重大顿挫。国民党某些报纸吹嘘“十月十日拿下张家口”殆成泡影。而在平汉北线，聂荣臻将军麾下之晋察冀子弟兵团，正以神勇动作，于控制铁路二百五十余里后，继续扩张战果，与察哈尔自卫战密切配合。蒋军在两线损失已达万余人。
