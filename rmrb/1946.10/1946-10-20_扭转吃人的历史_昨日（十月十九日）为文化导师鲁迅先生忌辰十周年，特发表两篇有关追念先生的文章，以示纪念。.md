　　Reversing the Cannibalistic History
    Yesterday (October 19th) was the tenth anniversary of the death of cultural mentor Mr. Lu Xun.
    We are publishing two articles commemorating Mr. Lu Xun to show our respect.
    Chinese history can generally be divided into two types of people: those who eat others and those who are eaten. However, those who write history only record the martial achievements of despotic rulers, the struggles for power of rogue executioners, and the "great" deeds of those who eat others. Mr. Lu Xun was the first to discover this cannibalistic history. He wrote in "Diary of a Madman": "I carefully examined history and found only two words: 'eat people.'"
    Only Mr. Lu Xun, who grew up in an ignorant rural village, was familiar with the tragic lives of those who were eaten in the animal-like towns, lives that were "worse generation by generation." He deeply sympathized with them, loved them, and saw their diseases, superstitions, and sufferings as the result of oppression, exploitation, and being eaten by a small number of landlords and bullies.
    Mr. Lu Xun sympathized with and loved those who were eaten very early on; he hated and exposed the faces of those who ate people very early on. Therefore, his thoughts were clear about what to love and what to hate, and his emotions were increasingly deep and strong in Chinese society. This kind of thinking became deeper and stronger in Chinese society. This kind of emotion became deeper and sharper in Chinese society. What he expressed in action and in his works was great love and great hatred; deep love and deep hatred.
    He raised his "javelin" and fought against all the dead and living cannibals. He fought against the cannibalistic old ethics, against the national essence faction, against metaphysical ghosts, against court scholars, against empty-headed writers, and against all feudal remnants, imperialism and its running dogs and slaves. He wanted "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth!" He wanted to "beat the drowning dog!"
    In the course of the battle, Mr. Lu Xun, in order to form iron ranks, so he could march towards the cannibalistic ranks. While fighting, he looked for comrades. In the arduous and tenacious struggle, he gradually felt the strength of his ranks. "The road is made by many people walking it," which he experienced on this fighting journey. When his comrades were buried alive and killed, Mr. Lu Xun was extremely saddened and mourned, but at the same time, it made him more determined and courageous. He had the will to "seek small poems in the thick of knives!"
    Mr. Lu Xun himself understood love and hatred, and often taught others how to love and how to hate. He himself knew how to fight cannibals, and often taught others how to fight. He himself never lost heart, and encouraged others not to lose heart. He used "eating grass and squeezing out milk" to feed the masses, to warn and encourage his comrades. In this way, many young people and many comrades followed him, and under his great instructions and encouragement, they joined the battle. This line is too strong. All of China's 360 million peasants and 30 million workers are members of this line.
    This line is the line that reverses the cannibalistic history!
    This year marks the tenth anniversary of Mr. Lu Xun's death. That group of cannibals is making a final struggle before their death, conspiring to steal the fruits of the people's resistance, colluding with American imperialism, attacking our liberated land and the people's army, attempting to strengthen their rule and continue their "cannibalistic" activities. At the same time, in our liberated land, the common people are carrying out a great turn-over movement, fiercely struggling against those cannibalistic landlords and bullies; tenant farmers and poor peasants have been given land and have received the fruits of their labor, and those who were eaten have returned to the position of true masters from their slave status.
    But this is the beginning of reversing the cannibalistic history. To commemorate Mr. Lu Xun, we must deepen our hatred for the cannibal - the reactionary Jiang-American clique - and turn hatred into action, "If the enemy does not surrender, eliminate him!" At the same time, we must strengthen our love for those who have been eaten, and extend that love to the masses. Make our team stronger, become an invincible force, and become a great force to reverse the history of cannibalism!

　　扭转吃人的历史
    昨日（十月十九日）为文化导师鲁迅先生忌辰十周年，
    特发表两篇有关追念先生的文章，以示纪念。
    中国的一部历史，大概分起来，只有两种人，一种是吃人的，一种是被吃的。然而，修写历史的人，却只记载着专制魔王的武功，流氓刽子手的争霸天下，以及吃人者的“伟大”事绩。鲁迅先生第一个发现了这种吃人的历史，他在《狂人日记》中写着：“翻开历史仔细一查，里面只有两个大字——吃人。”
    只有鲁迅先生，他生长在愚昧的农村，从小就看熟了兽镇上“一代不如一代”的被吃者的悲惨生活。他深深的同情他们，热爱他们，把他们的疾病，迷信，痛苦，都看做是被那些少数的地主恶霸压迫、剥削与被吃的结果。
    鲁迅先生很早就同情了，就热爱了被吃的；很早就憎恨了，暴露了吃人者的面貌。所以，在他思想里是爱憎分明，在他情感里是爱的越爱，恨的越恨。这种思想，在中国社会里越培养越深，越锻炼越坚强。这种情感，在中国社会里越培养越深厚，越锻炼越尖锐。他表现在行动中的，表现在作品中的，就是大的爱，大的恨；深的爱，深的恨。
    他举着自己的“投枪”，和死了的活着的一切的吃人者战斗。他和吃人的旧礼教战，和国粹派战，和玄学鬼战，和御用学者战，和空头文学家战，和一切封建余孽，帝国主义及其走狗、奴才战。他要“以眼还眼，以牙还牙。”他要“打落水狗”！
    在战斗的历程中，鲁迅先生为了结成钢铁的行列，好向吃人的队伍进军。他一面战斗，一面寻找战友，在艰苦韧性的搏战中，逐渐感到自己行列的强大，“路是众人走出来的”，正是他在这个战斗途程上所体验到的。当自己的战友被活埋了，杀害了，鲁迅先生是极悲痛悼惜的，但同时，也使他更坚定了，勇迈了，他有着“怒向刀丛觅小诗”的意志呵！
    鲁迅先生自己懂得了爱，懂得了憎，也常常教育别人怎样爱，怎样憎。他自己懂得怎样和吃人者搏斗，也常常教育别人怎样去搏斗。他自己从不灰心，也鼓励别人不灰心，他用“吃的是草，挤出来的是牛奶”去喂养大众，以警惕并鼓励自己的战友。这样，多少青年，多少战友，跟着他的后面，在他伟大指示、鼓励下参加了战斗。这个行列太壮大了，所有的全中国三万万六千万农民，三千万工人大众，都是这个行列的一员。
    这个行列是扭转吃人历史的行列！
    今年正值鲁迅先生逝世十周年，那一群吃人的家伙，正作垂死前的最后挣扎，阴谋盗取人民抗战的果实，勾结美国帝国主义，向咱们解放的土地，向人民的军队进攻，企图加强其统治地位，继续做其“吃人”的勾当。同时，在咱解放了的土地上，老百姓正做着大翻身运动，热火朝天地斗争了那些吃人的地主，恶霸；佃户，贫农都分得了土地，分得了果实，被吃的人从奴隶地位回到了真正的主人地位。
    但这是扭转吃人历史的开始。纪念鲁迅先生，咱们必须加深对吃人者——蒋美反动派的憎恨，把憎恨变成行动，“如果敌人不投降就消灭他”！同时，咱们要加强对被吃者的爱，把爱扩大到群众里去。使咱们的队伍成为更强大，成为不能战胜的力量，成为扭转吃人历史伟大力量！
