　　Jilu Yu and Southern Hebei Logistics Departments
    Launch Production Blitz
    Workers Labor Day and Night to Double Output
    All for Victory in the Overall War of Resistance
    [Reported by Our Newspaper from Jilu Yu on the 21st] As victory news from the front lines continues to pour in, and spoils of war are continuously transported back, the production enthusiasm of the people in the rear is greatly encouraged. The workers of the military region's logistics department have launched a production blitz. They unanimously believe that: if the army wins battles on the front lines, the rear should step up production to support the front lines. "If we fail to supply the needs of the front lines, we will be letting down the heroes on the front lines." They compete with each other and strive to become labor heroes. Working hours have automatically increased to ten hours, and even Sundays are not taken off. Squad leader Li Cunxin and Luo Hanjiu proposed a plan to saw 20,000 saw handles in a month. The sand-casting workers guaranteed to produce 60,000 shell casings in a month (doubling the previous output). The grooms also held meetings to plan their work, deciding to cut grass to feed the horses and save water and grass. The cooks also planned to renovate the boilers to save firewood and grain, ensuring good meals. After the blitz began, the work speed greatly increased. Comrade Liu Weimin's production volume doubled, Li Cunxin and Luo Hanjiu have already exceeded their original plan by one-quarter, and the work speed of armorer Xiong Mingchao exceeded three-fifths. Everyone recognizes them as shock troops. Song Kaiyu from the clothing factory has a disabled leg, and Yue Wenqi's leg wound is still dripping blood, but he still braves the wind and rain to inspect materials. Wang Shaobin, a manager in his fifties, and Rong Guangsi, a logistics officer, both with only one hand, automatically help load trucks, carry mortars, and heavy machine guns. The deputy director of the armory is sick, but upon hearing that bullets need to be sent to the front lines, he immediately jumped out of bed and said: "Comrades, hurry! Don't delay the combat missions at the front." He personally led the effort to carry 200 boxes of bullets in one go. The blitz is being carried out enthusiastically in all departments of the logistics system.

　　冀鲁豫冀南后勤部门
    展开生产突击运动
    工友们昼夜劳动产量倍增
    一切为了争取全面抵抗胜利
    【本报冀鲁豫二十一日电】前线的胜利消息不断传向后方，战利品源源运来，鼓舞着后方人民生产热忱，军区后勤部的工友们已展开了生产突击运动。他们一致认为：军队在前线打胜仗，后方就应该加油生产，支援前线。“供给不上前线的需要，就对不起前线的英雄们”。他们互相提出竞赛，争着做劳动英雄。工作时间自动增加至十小时，星期日也不休假。班长李存心与罗汉九提出一个月锯两万把子的计划，翻沙班工友保证一月出六万壳子（比过去提高产量一倍），马夫们也开会计划工作，决定割草喂马，节省水草，火夫也计划改造锅炉节省柴粮，保证把伙食搞好。突击开始后，工作速度大大提高。刘卫民同志生产量提高了一倍，李存心和罗汉九已超过原计划四分之一，修械工人熊名朝工作速度超过五分之三，大家公认为突击手。被服厂宋开玉的腿是残废，岳文歧腿上的伤口还滴着血水，但仍冒着风雨检查物资，五十多岁的管理员王绍宾、事务长荣光思都是一只手的残废，自动帮助装大车，扛迫击炮、重机枪，军械库副库长正在病中，听说要给前方送子弹，马上从床上跳下来说：“同志们快呀！不要耽误前方战斗任务。”他亲自领导一气搬了二百箱子弹。突击运动正在后勤各部门中热烈开展着。
