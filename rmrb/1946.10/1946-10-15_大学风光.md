　　University Scenery
    Xi An
    Peking University opposes textbookism in teaching, not through dogmatic preaching and advocating blind obedience and "cramming" injection methods; but by inspiring students to freely discuss, advocating bold skepticism, and开展 democratic debates, in order to achieve conscious critical acceptance. Professors do not show off their erudition by flaunting large books and reciting dogmas to scare students, but proceed from the needs of students, seek truth from facts, and achieve the goal of learning for application. They are not only responsible for classroom learning, considering their job done after lecturing; but are fully responsible for students' extracurricular life, social service, learning by doing, and then learning again from doing. They do not stand aloof, putting on airs, saying one thing and doing another to deceive and rule students; but, adhering to the principles of "integrating with the people" and "integrating with students," deeply understand students' thoughts and emotions, teaching students while also learning from students in the spirit of teaching and learning from each other, "from the masses, to the masses." They improve students step by step by setting an example. Everything is for the benefit of the students and the benefit of the people. Therefore, there is a high degree of revolutionary friendship between teachers and students. For each course, a teaching plan is proposed first, and after group discussion and consensus, teaching is then carried out. Hundreds of young people gather under the green shade, enthusiastically discussing and studying with an open mind. Not only are the teachers responsible, but the students are equally responsible.
    After class, some professors lead a few sheep to graze on the grassland, with their wives and children helping to take care of them, afraid they will eat other people's wheat. Some turn the soil and fertilize, planting tomatoes and various vegetables, working diligently, just like old farmers and gardeners. They are busy and happy, and working very seriously. The gaps on either side of the houses are turned into rows of vegetable plots, which are gardens cultivated by themselves. Some carry baskets and hooks and climb trees to pick mulberry leaves, bringing large baskets of mulberry leaves home. They raise many silkworms, preparing to make cocoons and spin silk. In their spare time, they are busy with production, reveling in the embrace of nature.
    The students have reclaimed more than 200 acres of land, pulling plows in groups, farming and planting themselves. Many labor heroes were selected, and many loafers were criticized. After class, groups of them take hoes and carry plows to work in their own fields. Although they are sweating profusely, they still work non-stop.
    In order to build new school buildings, the school buys bricks for four yuan each. The students organized themselves to take time to tear down bricks from the city walls. They borrowed carts to pull them to the school, and each person received fifty or sixty yuan each time. They helped with the school's construction, supplemented their own pocket money, taking both public and private interests into consideration, and also cultivated the habit of labor. University students pulling bricks, isn't this an unprecedented initiative?
    When the wheat is ripe, the staff and students get up at the crow of the rooster, under the starry sky, and set off in teams to help poor and lower-middle peasants harvest wheat. Without eating or drinking, large swaths of wheat fall down in the "swish, swish" sound. They are stacked up one after another. When the sun comes out and the day gets hotter, everyone returns to school in groups for class. They set off again early the next day.
    Saturday night is the happiest! Thousands of young men and women gather on the large playground. The moonlight is like water, and the cool breeze is gentle. The entertainment evening begins. The programs include Shanxi Opera, Henan Ballad Singing, Hanzhong Music, Kaifeng Yangko Dance, Peking Opera, stories... everything is available. All are extremely moving and wonderful. Everyone fully expresses their skills, earning the laughter and applause of their classmates.
    There are more than a dozen wall newspapers. They freely express opinions on learning, life, current affairs, thoughts, and suggestions and plans for the school. They also propose debates on some specialized issues. One article raises questions on the left, and another answers on the right. They are passionately debating for the pursuit of truth. From the principal to the janitors, they are often criticized or rewarded in the wall newspapers. The Dragon Boat Festival featured a special issue on Qu Yuan, providing a comprehensive introduction to this patriotic poet. The writing of each newspaper is very artistic and beautiful. There are also many exquisite colorful cartoons, embellishing the middle, making it even more eye-catching.
    Peking University—this new type of higher education institution, we hope you will lead the cultural education of the entire border region, create experience for the new democratic education, and lay the foundation for the educational transformation of old universities across the country.

　　大学风光
    习庵
    北大在教学上反对课本主义，不是武断的说教与提倡盲目服从和“填鸭”式的注入方式；而是启发学生自由研讨，提倡大胆怀疑，开展民主争论，以达到自觉的批判的接受。教授们不是搬弄大本书，背教条，以示渊博来吓唬学生，而是从学生需要出发，实事求是，以达学以致用的目的。不是只对课内学习负责，讲了课算完事；而是对学生课外生活，社会服务，学了做，从做中再学负完全责任。不是高高在上装腔做势，说的一套做的又是一套去欺骗学生与统治学生；而是本着“和人民打成一片”，“和学生打成一片”，深入了解学生思想情绪，本着教学相长的精神，教学生同时也向学生学习，“从群众中来，到群众中去”。以身作则把学生提高一步。一切为了学生利益，为了人民利益。因此教师与学生之间充满了高度的革命友爱。一门课程先提出教学计划，通过小组讨论，意见一致后，再进行教学。几百青年集中在绿荫之下，热烈的讨论，虚心的研究，不仅是教的负责，学的也同样负责。
    下课后教授们有的牵着几只羊，在绿草地上放，夫人、小孩都在帮助招呼，光怕它们吃了人家的麦子。有的翻土施肥，栽种西红柿和各种菜蔬，胼手胝足，俨然是老农老圃。忙的挺高兴，干的挺认真。住屋左右的隙地，变成一列一列的菜畦，这是他们自己垦植的园地。有的携筐持钩，自己爬上树去采桑，大筐的桑叶，携回家来。他们喂了很多的蚕，准备作茧缫丝的。公余之暇，就忙着生产，陶醉在大自然的怀抱里。
    学生们开垦了二百多亩地，分组拉犁，自耕自种。选出许多劳动英雄，也批评了不少滑头懒汉。下课后成群结队的拿着＠头扛着锄，到自己的地里去工作。虽然是挥汗如雨，仍旧是不停不休。
    为建筑新校舍，学校买砖，四元一个。同学们组织起来扯暇到城墙上扒砖。借车子拉到学校，每人每次分五六十元。帮助了学校建设，补足了自己零用，公私兼顾，又锻炼劳作习惯。大学生拉砖，这不是空前创举吗？
    麦子熟了，职教员和学生们鸡叫就起来了，满天星斗，结队出发，帮助贫抗贫农割麦。不吃不喝，大块麦子，在“刷刷”声里纷纷倒下了。一叠叠的堆了起来。太阳出来，天渐热了，大家又成群结队返校上课。第二天绝早又出发了。
    礼拜六的晚上最快活！千百个青年男女集合在大操场上。月明如水，凉风习习，娱乐晚会开始了。节目有山西梆子、河南坠子、汉中音乐、开封秧歌、京剧、故事……等应有尽有。都极动人又极精彩，每个人都尽情的吐露自己的一技之长，博得同学们的欢笑和掌声。
    壁报有十几种。对学习、生活、时事、思想以及对学校的建议计划等自由发表意见。对一些专门问题，还提出论战。左一篇质问，右一篇答辩。为追求真理而热烈的争论着。从校长到勤杂人员，在壁报经常受到批评或奖励。五月节出了屈原专号，对于这位爱国诗人作了全面介绍，每份报纸的编写都非常艺术美观。还有不少精致的五彩漫画，点缀中间，更引人注目。
    北大——这个新型的最高学府，我们希望你领导全边区的文化教育，为新民主主义的教育创造经验，为全国旧大学的教育改造打下基础。
