[Report from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Front, this newspaper, 1st] The mass guerrilla movement is flourishing on the vast Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain. On the western front, one of our guerrilla groups ambushed and routed a unit of Chiang's troops that attacked Yangji, 18 miles south of Dongming, on the 18th, killing or wounding twelve, seizing a light machine gun, and returning all the grain seized by Chiang's troops to the masses. On the 19th, another of our guerrilla groups ambushed west of Dahuangji, Heze, killing or wounding more than 50 Chiang's soldiers. On the same day, another guerrilla detachment drove away the "Homecoming Corps" of Chiang's troops that had occupied Jianchangzhi, Cao County, and returned the grain they had plundered to the masses. On the southern front, more than 120 members of the Ningling Chiang's Army Security Regiment and secret agents attacked Zhanggong Dayangzhuang, east of Juye County, on the 19th, and were severely attacked by our local guerrillas, suffering more than 20 casualties, capturing several alive, and seizing a machine gun. On the eastern front, more than 300 Chiang's troops occupying Shan County advanced along the Shan (County)-Feng (County) highway to attack Xingji and Yangji on the 21st, and were constantly harassed by our militia, and fled back to Shan County on the same day in embarrassment.

[Report from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, this newspaper, 30th] Chiang's troops, after falling into our Heze County, are uneasy. In addition to densely deploying sentry posts throughout the city, they are also urgently repairing a 45-mile-long "city protection embankment" around the city. The masses in villages, large and small, within the embankment area are not allowed to step out of the line. Chiang's troops also forcibly order the masses within the embankment to perform labor service unconditionally, making it impossible for the masses to harvest the autumn crops, and there is a constant danger of being killed. The masses could no longer bear it, so they secretly colluded to organize small, decentralized armed forces, the "Underground Eighth Route Army," that frequently appeared in the suburbs of Heze. On the 13th, during the day, they raided the Chiang's troop stronghold in Liuzhuang, north of the embankment. Chiang's troops were extremely panicked and continued to shoot in all directions, consuming countless ammunition, until three hours after our mass guerrillas withdrew. The masses inside the "city protection embankment" also coordinated their actions, cutting electric wires and creating false information to harass the invading army.

[Report from Hebei-Shandong-Henan, this newspaper, 30th] In order to cooperate with Chiang's troops penetrating into the central area of our Hebei-Shandong-Henan, Chiang's troops on the eastern front have been actively attacking for days. A regiment of more than 1,000 men from Fang Xianjue's 88th Division (original army) of Chiang's troops stationed in Feng County captured Jinxiang City on the 21st; on the same day, a unit of Chiang's troops stationed in Shan County attacked Chenpuzhuang and continued to attack north. Wherever Chiang's troops went, they burned, killed, looted, and the people were extremely resentful, and they took up arms one after another to launch a self-defense guerrilla war to protect their homes and lives.

[Report from Handan, this newspaper, 30th] Chiang's Third Army in Shijiazhuang, in coordination with the puppet troops of Hou Ruyong and Wei Yonghe, totaling more than 3,000 men, after invading and occupying Zhao County on the 14th, took Zhao County as a stronghold and actively advanced into the Taihang and Southern Hebei Liberated Areas. In recent days, they have occupied more than 30 villages and towns, including Shanyin Village, Laixiang west of Yuanshi, and Changtun, Dongxi Guocun, and Yingli west of Zhao County. The local militia guerrilla groups have launched heroic counterattacks against the invading Chiang and puppet troops. On the night of the 21st, they recovered the Chiang and puppet strongholds in Beisu, Kou Village, and Lirenzhuang southeast of Yuanshi, capturing eight die-hard puppets and seizing nine rifles. Another 400 defeated die-hard puppet agents fled to Yuanshi City, and our guerrilla groups are now actively counterattacking.

[Report from Changzhi, this newspaper, 30th] The newly emancipated masses in the marginal areas of the northern Taihang Front are launching a self-defense guerrilla mine warfare movement. On the 12th, when they harassed Haocun and Wangxijia villages on the edge of Yan Xishan's Taigu area, three people were killed and one was wounded by landmines. On the 14th, the joint defense militia guerrilla group set up mines and destroyed a large cart and three mules of the Yan puppet army. On the 18th, more than 40 Yan puppet troops and "Homecoming Corps" from the Yulin Nan'ao Yan puppet stronghold attacked Nantian in the third district. The newly organized explosives team in the village laid a network of landmines in advance. When the invading army rushed into the village, as soon as they entered the village and pushed open the door, the door mine exploded, and immediately flesh and blood flew. The die-hards and puppets, seeing that the situation was not good, fled outwards, and they ran into road mines exploding while fleeing. The enemy was terrified and fled back in panic. This time, three Yan soldiers (including one company commander) were killed and eight were wounded.
