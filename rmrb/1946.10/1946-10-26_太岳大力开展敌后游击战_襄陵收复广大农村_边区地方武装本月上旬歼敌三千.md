　　[This newspaper's Yangcheng dispatch of the 22nd] Following the recovery of the Fuyi Highway, local armed forces of our Second Military Subdistrict, in coordination with the militia, penetrated deep into the rear of the invading Chiang troops, further expanding the guerrilla war. Xiangling County, whose liberated areas were occupied by Chiang-Yan troops on January 13, has been recovered. Most of the Linfen-Fushan Highway is also under the control of the guerrillas, and the Chiang troops in Fushan are completely isolated and besieged by the guerrillas. At the beginning of October, when the Chiang troops in Linfen invaded northwards, the Xiangling Security Brigade, in conjunction with the militia, launched an offensive and successively recovered vast areas such as Taosi, Anli, and Dongzhang, and established democratic regimes. Within ten days, they captured 15 Chiang soldiers, killed 8, and seized some supplies and ammunition. On the 15th, our local corps attacked the Xiangling "Love the Homeland Corps" at Dengzhuang (east of Xiangling), capturing three alive, killing or wounding more than ten, seizing one machine gun and three rifles, and liberating more than twenty captured militiamen and their families. We also recovered Dengzhuang. On the same day, another unit of our local corps ambushed a Chiang army transport team at Dayangchen (35 li east of Linfen), intercepting three mules and horses and some supplies, and capturing four Chiang soldiers alive. The electric wires erected by the Chiang army on the Linfu Highway have also been destroyed by us and have not yet been reconnected.
　　
　　Xinhua News Agency, Jinji Luyu, 23rd: General report: The Eighth Route Army's local corps and militia guerrilla units, active behind the Chiang troops' occupied areas in Jinji Luyu, are operating outside every isolated city occupied by Chiang and puppet troops, making it difficult for the Chiang troops to move even an inch. From the 2nd to the 9th of this month, the Chiang troops in Xia County and Wenxi in southern Shanxi launched six fierce attacks on local armed forces and militia in the suburbs, all of which were repelled. At present, the vast rural areas east of the two counties have returned to the state before July. The Lingshi-Huo County section of the Tongpu Railway, the Fushan-Yicheng Highway, and the Linfen-Fushan Highway are all under the control of the Eighth Route Army's guerrilla heroes. In the Chiang army-occupied areas of Ji Luyu, from Zhecheng and Qixian in eastern Henan in the south, to Heze and Dingtao in southwestern Shandong in the north, to Peixian and Fengxian in northern Jiangsu in the east, and to Dongming and Changyuan in southern Hebei in the west, democratic regimes have been restored in most rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 115 attacks were launched against the Chiang Yan and puppet troops in the first half of October, killing or wounding more than 2,000 people, capturing 1,319 alive, seizing 4 mortars, 8 grenade launchers, 7 heavy machine guns, 46 light machine guns, 2 American-made submachine guns, 646 long and short guns, 7 trucks, destroying 30 li of railways, destroying 1 locomotive, and blowing up 4 important bridges.
