Cultural and Educational Briefs

　　Following eighteen days of performances of famous dramas such as "Jiangshan" and "Zhou Zishan," the Literary and Art Work Team of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University, also performed the historical drama "Lian Po and Lin Xiangru" on September 25th at the farewell meeting for cadres going to the front lines, organized by the university's directly affiliated units. The performance and acting skills showed significant improvement compared to the previous two dramas, and the entire university praised it. This script was created in Yan'an and performed repeatedly there. It is a good play about the internal relations of the revolutionary front, and it has been rarely performed in this area. After the performance, comrades going to the front lines reflected, "When we get to the front, we must do a good job in military-political relations and unite to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's offensive." Cadres working at home also conducted self-criticism, saying that they often argued with comrades over trivial matters and felt very ashamed after watching the play. After the performance, the comrades of the Art Work Team reviewed the performance effect, as well as their own interpersonal relationships and military-political relations. "Performing dramas not only educates people, but also educates ourselves."
　　
　　Furthermore: They are now rushing to rehearse the opera "The White Haired Girl."

　　文教简讯
    继演出十八天江山及周子山等名剧之后，晋冀鲁豫军政大学文艺工作队，又在九月二十五日校直属队欢送上前线干部大会上出演了历史名剧廉颇与蔺相如，效果演技比前两剧均大有进步，全校咸予好评。这个剧本是延安创作，曾在延安迭次演出，是写革命阵线内部关系的一个好戏，本区尚很少演出。此次出演后，开赴前线同志纷纷反映：“到前方，一定搞好军政关系，团结一致打垮蒋介石的进攻”，在家里干的部也纷纷检讨，说同志之间因点点小事就争嘴，看了此剧十分惭愧。文工队同志出演后一面检讨演出效果；一面检讨自己的同志关系、军政关系。“演剧不仅教育人，也教育了自己。”
    又讯：现在他们正赶排歌剧：白毛女。
