Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 1st (Delayed Dispatch): According to reports from Chengdu and Chongqing newspapers, the people's uprising in Sichuan has spread throughout the province, with personnel and firearms totaling over 100,000. Their equipment includes various types of rifles, machine guns, as well as small steel cannons, mortars, and even heavy artillery. They have been tempered and developed in the continuous defeat of the Kuomintang army's "encirclement and suppression."

The Eastern Sichuan uprising armed forces number approximately 8,000 to 10,000 personnel and firearms, operating in over a dozen counties including Wuxi, Fengjie, Yunyang, Wanxian, Daxian, Quxian, Guang'an, Yuechi, Linshui, Hechuan, Dianjiang, and Dazhu. Among them, the peasant armed forces of Linshui, Yuechi, and Guang'an, numbering two to three thousand, use Huaying Mountain (i.e., the Dongyue Mountain range) as their base and are gaining considerable momentum. The Chiang government dispatched the American-equipped 14th Army's 83rd Division to be stationed in Dianjiang and the 10th Division in Linshui, along with a security regiment, to carry out "suppression." In July, they killed hundreds of village chiefs and residents in the area. However, due to the emergency of uprisings in other counties, the army was transferred in early August, and the people's armed forces became active again.

The Southern Sichuan uprising force has more than 5,000 personnel and firearms, operating in over twenty counties on the border of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hunan, extending from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, both north and south, including Gulan, Gusong, Xuyong, Junlian, Gongxian, Changning, Xingwen, Yibin, Nanxi, Jiang'an, Emei, Leshan, Neijiang, Rongchang, Longchang, Jiangjin, Xiushan, and even Weixin and Zhenxiong in Yunnan, and Yongshun and Sangzhi in Hunan. Their leaders include Chen Dianze, Chen Wenzhong, Yin Juzi, Zeng Zhongwen, Zeng Wenming, Zhang Zhanbiao, Peng Chunrong, etc., possessing weapons such as mortars, machine guns, and submachine guns. Peng Chunrong's unit of over a thousand personnel is active on the Sichuan-Hunan border. An armed organization near Liuxianchang in Nanxi is called the "Youth Society," and civil servants from counties such as Fushun have also joined. Chen Banxiang's unit in Gulan conspicuously displays large and small flags and lanterns with the words "Sichuan-Yunnan-Guizhou Guerrilla Brigade" written on them. A unit between Gongxian and Xingwen flies the banner of "Poverty Relief Corps." The uprising armed forces in Rongchang and Longchang frequently travel to and from the Chengdu-Chongqing Road, which is heavily guarded by military police.

The number of personnel and firearms in Northern Sichuan is over 20,000. The insurgents are mostly peasants and discharged soldiers, spreading throughout counties such as Nanjiang, Wangcang, Guangyuan, Tongjiang, Bazhong, Langzhong, Cangxi, Zhaohua, Jiange, and Jiangyou. Their main forces are based in Nanjiang, Wangcang, and Guangyuan, occupying a vast forest area of several hundred li, with extensive trenches built around the perimeter. Peasant armed forces once besieged Tongjiang. The Chiang government ordered the Sichuan-Shaanxi-Hubei armies to "jointly suppress" them, launching a four-pronged attack from August, engaging in fierce battles in the Nanjiang and Wangcang areas. According to the Chongqing Business Daily of August 25, the detective brigade sent by the 15th District has been completely disarmed.

In Central Sichuan's Anyue and Lezhi, there are 300 to 400 personnel and firearms, possessing small cannons, machine guns, automatic pistols, and Zhongzheng rifles. They once attacked Anyue city.

The Western Sichuan uprising armed forces currently discovered number 4,000 to 5,000 personnel, scattered in over twenty counties including Chongqing, Dayi, Guanxian, Pengxian, Mianzhu, Shifang, Xinfan, Xindu, Qionglai, Meishan, Jintang, Wenjiang, Luojiang, Huayang, Renshou, Maoxian, Anxian, Wenchuan, Mingshan, and Tianquan, Rongjing, Lushan, and Ya'an on the border of Xikang. The rebel leaders include Chen Shu'an, Xiao Huasong, Li Songyun, Dai Yongzhang, Chen Qingyun, Wang Mao, Yang Maoting, Fan Chengzhang, Fan Cheng Gu, and Li Yuanxiang, Zhu Shilong, and Chen Zi in Xikang. The terrain they occupy, such as Huaizhen, Anrenzhen, and Wanjia Ping in Chongqing, Dayi, and Guanxian counties, and Qian Di Shan and Daliang Mountain in Maoxian and Anxian counties, is rugged and strategically important. The forces led by Chen Shu'an, Xiao Huasong, and others, in addition to rifles, have dozens of machine guns; and there are slogans and propaganda. On June 11, this unit engaged in a fierce battle with over 600 security guards at Niangniang Temple, and a platoon of the security guards immediately joined the unit. A special service company from Dayi, led by company commander Liu Futian, joined the Ya'an rebel forces.

    川中之安岳、乐至有人枪三四百，拥有小炮、机枪、快慢机及中正式步枪等，曾一度攻入安岳城中。
