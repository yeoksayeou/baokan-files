    China Far East Conference Opens
    Patterson and DeLacy Denounce Aid-Chiang Policy
    Firmly Advocate Withdrawal of US Marines from China
    [Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 22nd] TASS, San Francisco, 21st: The China Far East Conference held in San Francisco by the American “Committee for Peace” and the “Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy” opened on the evening of the 18th. At the opening, a mass meeting of more than 1,500 people was held. At the mass meeting, California Democratic Congressman Patterson demanded the withdrawal of the United States Marines from China. He said when asking whether the US Marines staying in China was launching another war, "I believe that those responsible for American policy have this insidious policy in their minds." He pointed out, "Byrnes once promised him and other congressmen that the US Marines would withdraw as soon as the Japanese army was disarmed, but now the State Department ignores the question of why the US Marines are still stationed in China." Patterson predicted that the American people would not allow the policies of Byrnes, Vandenberg, and Connally to continue. Brigadier General Carlson of the Marine Corps, chairman of the two committees that prepared the conference, originally planned to give a speech, but was unable to attend due to illness. He sent a letter to the conference, denouncing war instigators. The conference began discussions in the afternoon of the 19th. Washington State Democratic Congressman DeLacy gave a speech denouncing the American policy of supporting Chiang Kai-shek. DeLacy compared Roosevelt's policy of aiding Chinese unity with the current government's policy, saying: "The United States is doing its utmost to oppose the demands of the Chinese and Asian people to end the colonial system, a system that has made their lives extremely miserable. Our country has become the last bastion of imperialism. Roosevelt, Hull, and Willkie all said that the main reason for this war was to end imperialism, but this sentence has become a complete lie in China, Indonesia, and the Philippines!" He admired the foreign policy questions raised by Wallace, which is one of the most important issues in current politics.

　　中国远东会议开幕
    柏德逊德拉西痛斥援蒋政策
    坚主美海军陆战队自华撤退
    【新华社延安二十二日电】塔斯社旧金山二十一日讯：美国在“争取和平委员会”与“民主远东政策委员会”主持下于旧金山举行的中国远东会议，已于十八日晚开幕，开幕时曾举行了一次一千五百余人参加的群众大会。在群众大会上，加利福尼亚州民主党众议员柏德逊，要求美国海军陆战队从中国撤退。他在向美国海军陆战队留在中国是否是发动另一次战争时说道：“我相信那些负责美国政策的人，在他们的思想中有这种阴险政策”。他指出：“贝纳斯曾一度向他及其他议员，约许美国陆战队在日军解除武装时即行撤退，但是现在国务院却不理美国陆战队何以仍旧驻在中国的问题”。柏德逊预言美国人民不会准许贝纳斯、范登堡与康纳利政策继续下去的。筹备此次会议的该两委员会主席、海军陆战队卡尔逊准将，原拟发表讲演，但因病未克出席，他致函会议，痛斥战争挑拨者。会议于十九日下午开始讨论，华盛顿州民主党众议员德拉西发表演讲，痛斥美国支持蒋介石的政策。德拉西把罗斯福援助中国团结的政策与现政府的政策加以对照说：“美国竭力反对中国与亚洲人民结束殖民地关系制度的要求，这种制度已使他们的生活极为悲惨，我国已成为帝国主义的最后堡垒，罗斯福、赫尔与威尔基都说，此次战争的主要理由，是结束帝国主义，但是这句话在中国、印度尼西亚与菲律滨，已变成漫天大谎！”他敬佩华莱士提出的外交政策问题，这是现在政治中最重要问题之一。
