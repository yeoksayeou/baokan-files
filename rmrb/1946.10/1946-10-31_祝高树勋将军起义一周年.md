　　Celebrating the First Anniversary of General Gao Shuxun's Uprising
　　Zhu De
　　In the history of modern China, there are two kinds of armies and two kinds of soldiers: one is the feudal army, the army of dictators; the other is the democratic army, the army of the people. The first kind is loyal to a few reactionaries. Although this kind of army and soldiers can temporarily show off their power, they are regarded as demons by the people, hated and resisted by the people, and eventually cannot escape the fate of extinction. The second kind is loyal to the nation and the people. Although this kind of army and soldiers are temporarily small in number, they are praised and loved by the people, and will eventually win. The feudal army serves foreign imperialism and dictators, oppressing and slaughtering Chinese compatriots and the Chinese people. This not only violates the interests of the people, but also violates the interests of the nation. The reason is very clear. Therefore, many officers and soldiers of these armies, after awakening, will inevitably break away from imperialism and feudal dictators, refuse to be their tools, and stand on the side of the people. This rule was true in the Xinhai Revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty, in the war against Yuan Shikai who sold out the country, in the Northern Expedition against the Northern Warlords, in the ten-year civil war after the failure of the Great Revolution, in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, and even more so in today's struggle between the two lines of independence, peace, democracy, and selling out the country through internal war and dictatorship. On October 30th last year, General Gao Shuxun, former Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 11th War Zone, held an anti-civil war uprising on the front lines of southern Hebei and established the Democratic National Construction Army, which proved this truth. In the past year, in addition to General Gao Shuxun's uprising, there was also General Cao Yousan's uprising of the New 11th Brigade in Anbian on October 25th, and General Hao Pengju's uprising of the 60th Army in Taierzhuang on January 9th this year, establishing the Central China Democratic Allied Army; General Kong Congzhou's uprising of the 55th Division of the 38th Army in Gongxian on May 15th, establishing the Northwest Democratic Allied Army 38th Army; General Pan Shuoduan's uprising of the 184th Division of the 60th Army in Haicheng on May 31st, establishing the Democratic Allied Army First Army; Captain Liu Shanben of the Air Force 8th Squadron flew a "B-24" aircraft to Yan'an on June 26th; General Hu Jingduo, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Shaanxi Northern Security Team, launched an uprising in Hengshan on October 13th, as well as countless other similar events, forming a trend, with the uprising armies reaching 20 percent of Chiang Kai-shek's total military strength. Their common demand is not to be a slave to American imperialism, not to be a watchdog for the four major families of Chiang, Kong, Song, and Chen. The Gao Shuxun movement has become the banner of all patriotic and conscientious officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army, navy, and air force, and has become one of the important factors for the people to defeat the reactionaries and achieve independence, peace, and democracy in the self-defense war.
　　The development of the Gao Shuxun movement has a special historical basis today. First, today's war of aggression against the liberated areas by the reactionaries is a particularly unjust war. This not only violates the ceasefire order and the Political Consultative Conference resolution signed by Chiang Kai-shek himself, but also makes it increasingly clear to people that the essence of the attack on the liberated areas is a war to sell out the country and a war of traitors fought for American imperialism. Second, most of the troops and soldiers in the Kuomintang today find it particularly difficult to endure this shameful war, because most of them have just experienced the glorious War of Resistance Against Japan. After fighting the glorious War of Resistance Against Japan, they are now fighting a shameful civil war together with the puppet troops. After fighting Japanese imperialism, they are now wearing American hats, taking up American weapons, and killing Chinese people under the command of American imperialism. This kind of stain is too heartbreaking. Third, the Kuomintang's army and soldiers have already publicly recognized that the anti-communist war is a "life sentence." Today, the civil war has just begun, and they have continuously encountered major annihilation blows, forcing them to decide their own way out in the face of the fate of being eliminated. Although the reactionaries can rely on the equipment and transportation conditions provided by the United States to temporarily seize some cities, their entire military strength is becoming weaker and weaker as they fight, while the liberated areas are becoming stronger and stronger as they fight. This basic situation is now even clearer. Fourth, the reactionaries' policy of using the civil war to annex and eliminate miscellaneous armies forces about half of the Kuomintang's army to awaken faster. Fifth, after the Kuomintang army came into contact with the liberated area army, they found that the anti-communist propaganda that the Kuomintang authorities had carried out on them was completely deceptive. What about the Communist Party killing people and setting fires, peeling the skin of prisoners, burying them alive, etc.? This set immediately lost its effect and produced the opposite effect. They saw with their own eyes how the liberated area army was loyal to the interests of the country and the nation, how they were loyal to the interests of the people, how they cared for the Kuomintang officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons, and how they treated the Kuomintang officers and soldiers who rose up against the civil war with preferential treatment. All of this was exactly the opposite of the reactionaries. The reactionaries eliminated dissidents, while in the liberated areas, as long as they stood on the common ground of opposing the civil war and dictatorship that sold out the country, all forces were friendly troops and received the respect and help of the people. This is exactly what the practical experience of the Gao Shuxun movement over the past year has fully proven. Because of all of the above, I believe that the Gao Shuxun movement will inevitably achieve greater development in the future, and will inevitably stand on a three-legged stool with the resistance of the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas and the uprisings of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas. The convergence of these three trends will inevitably directly cause the military failure of the reactionaries and effectively restore peace throughout the country.
　　All patriotic and conscientious officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang army, navy, and air force, in this great struggle that determines the future of the country and the nation, are they willing to commit crimes against the people and the nation and be cursed by all generations? Or are they willing to make contributions to the people and the nation and be praised by all generations? Now is the time for them to make up their minds and take action!

　　祝高树勋将军起义一周年
    朱德
    近代中国的历史上、有两种军队，两种军人：一种是封建的军队，独裁者的军队；另一种是民主的军队，人民的军队。头一种是为少数反动分子效忠的，这种军队和军人暂时虽然可以耀武扬威，却被人民看做恶魔，受到人民的痛恨和反抗，最后不能逃脱灭亡的命运。另一种是为民族和人民效忠的，这种军队和军人暂时虽然数量较小，却被人民歌颂爱戴，最后必然胜利。封建的军队为外国帝国主义服务，为独裁者服务，压迫和屠杀中国同胞、中国人民，这不但违反人民的利益，而且违反民族的利益，其理甚显，因此这些军队的很多官兵在觉悟以后，就必然脱离帝国主义与封建独裁者，拒绝做他们的工具，而站到人民方面来。这个规律在推翻满清的辛亥革命中是如此，在卖国讨袁的战争中是如此，在反对北洋军队的北伐战争中是如此，在大革命失败后的十年内战中是如此，在八年抗日战争中是如此，在今天的独立和平民主与卖国内战独裁两条战线的斗争中更是如此。去年十月卅日，前十一战区副司令长官高树勋将军在冀南前线举行反内战起义而成立民主建国军，就证明了这个真理。在过去一年中间，除高树勋将军的起义以外，还有十月二十五日新十一旅曹又参将军在安边起义，今年一月九日第六十军郝鹏举将军在台儿庄起义，成立华中民主联军；五月十五日三十八军五十五师孔从周将军在巩县起义，成立西北民主联军三十八军；五月三十一日六十军一八四师潘朔端将军在海城起义，成立民主同盟军第一军；六月二十六日空军第八大队刘善本上尉驾“Ｂ二四”式机来延；十月十三日陕北保安队副总指挥胡景铎将军在横山起义，以及其他无数次的同类事件，形成了一个潮流，起义军队达蒋介石总兵力的百分之二十。不愿当美国帝国主义的亡国奴，不愿当蒋孔宋陈四大财阀家族的看家狗，就是它们的共同要求。高树勋运动已经成为国民党陆海空军中一切有爱国心、有良心的广大官兵的旗帜，成为人民在自卫战争中战胜反动派而实现独立和平民主的重要因素之一。
    高树勋运动的发展，在今天有特别历史基础。第一、今天反动派进攻解放区的战争是特别不义的战争，这不但违反蒋介石自己所签字的停战命令和政协决议，而且人们越来越看得明白，进攻解放区的实质，乃是替美帝国主义打的亡国仗、汉奸仗。第二、今天国民党内大多数军队和军人，特别难于忍受这种可耻的战争，因为他们大多数都刚刚经历过光荣的抗战，打了光荣的抗战又和伪军一起来的打可耻的内战，打了日本帝国主义戴起美国帽子、拿起美国武器、在美帝国主义指挥下来杀中国人，这种污点是太令人痛心了。第三、国民党的军队和军人过去就已经公认反共战争是“无期徒刑”，今天内战才一开始，就不断遇到重大的歼灭打击，迫使他们必须在消灭的命运面前决定自己的出路。反动派虽然可以依靠美国所供给的装备和运输的条件，暂时夺取一些城市，但是他整个的军事力量都是愈战愈弱，而解放区则愈战愈强，这个基本形势现在是更加明白了。第四、反动派利用内战来吞并和消灭杂牌军的政策，使约占半数的国民党军队不能不觉悟得更快。第五、国民党军队在与解放区军队接触以后，他们就发现国民党当局给他们进行的反共宣传完全是欺骗，什么共产党杀人放火呀，俘虏要剥皮呀、活埋呀等等，这一套马上失掉作用，而产生反作用，他们亲眼看到了解放区的军队怎样忠于国家民族的利益，怎样忠于人民的利益，怎样爱护放下武器的国民党军官兵，以及怎样优待反内战起义的国民党军官兵，这一切都与反动派恰恰相反。反动派消灭异己，而在解放区却是只要站在反卖国内战独裁的共同立场上，一切的力量都是友军，都得到人民的尊重和帮助，这正是一年来的高树勋运动的实际经验所完全证明了的。由于上述的一切，我相信高树勋运动今后必然会得到更大的发展，必然会与解放区军民的抵抗，蒋管区人民的起义鼎足而三，这三个潮流汇合一致，必然会直接造成反动派的军事失败，有效的恢复全国的和平。
    国民党陆海空军中一切有爱国心、有良心的官兵，在这个决定国家民族前途的伟大斗争中，是愿意对人民、对民族犯罪而受万世的唾骂呢？是愿意为人民、为民族立功而受万世的赞扬呢？现在是他们下决心行动的时候了！
