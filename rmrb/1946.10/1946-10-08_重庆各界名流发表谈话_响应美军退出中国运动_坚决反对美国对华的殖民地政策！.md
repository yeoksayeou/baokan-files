Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 4th: Chongqing dispatch: Prominent figures from industrial, commercial, financial, cultural, scientific, and legal circles here have been giving interviews to Xinhua Daily reporters in recent days, responding to the "American Troops Get Out of China Week" movement. Scientist Wu Huazi said indignantly: "Just when the Chinese people are in dire need of peace, the American government is sending troops and supplies for war. Marshall's so-called 'mediation' is actually a double-dealing policy of the American reactionaries. We demand that Marshall immediately stop this tactic and not favor the warmongers." Xu Chonglin, Chairman of the United Association of Small and Medium Factories, said: "American soldiers in China arbitrarily shoot Chinese students and insult Chinese workers and women, surpassing even the Japanese." Xu believes that if the United States stops aiding Chiang, the Chinese civil war will stop. Only with peace and stability can the industrial and commercial sectors pursue their own businesses. He called on the Chinese and American people to resolutely oppose the anti-people policies of the Chinese and American governments and demanded that the American government restore Roosevelt's policies. Novelist Ai Wu stated: "Why are American troops so late in leaving and supporting the undemocratic one-party government, equipping its military forces as much as possible, making it impossible to realize the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference jointly produced by all parties! The Chinese people resolutely oppose this imperialist colonial policy!" Poet Chai Guang said: "If the American troops still do not withdraw, then the entire Chinese people will develop an unstoppable sense of hatred towards the American government." Journalist Liu Canglang exclaimed: "We want to ask the American troops to quickly get out of China!" Lawyer Zuo Guohan pointed out: "An independent and free country absolutely does not allow any foreign troops to be stationed on its own territory." In addition, Fan Zhongqu, Chairman of the Chongqing City Bank Association, Zhou Yonglin of the Chongqing branch of the Chinese Rural Research Association, and figures from the cultural circles Li Yang, Shen Qiyu, He Lu, Gan Cisen, and others, unanimously demanded that the U.S. government withdraw American troops stationed in China and stop all aid to the Kuomintang government.

　　重庆各界名流发表谈话
    响应美军退出中国运动
    坚决反对美国对华的殖民地政策！
    【新华社延安四日电】渝讯：此间工商、金融、文化、科学、律师各界名流，连日纷向新华日报记者发表谈话，响应美军“退出中国周”运动。科学家吴华梓愤慨的说：“正当中国人民极需和平的时候，美国政府却送来作战的军队与物资，而马歇尔的所谓“调解”实是美国反动派的两面政策，要求马歇尔立即停止这种手法，不要偏袒好战分子。”中小工厂联合会理事长徐崇林说：“美军在华任意枪杀中国学生，侮辱中国工人及妇女，比日本人有过之而无不及。”徐氏认为美国停止援蒋，中国内战即会停下来。只有和平安定，工商界才可做自己的事业。他号召中美人民坚决反对中美政府的反人民政策，并要求美国政府恢复罗斯福政策。小说家艾芜称：美军为何迟迟不走，并且援助不民主的一党政府，尽量装备其作战的军队，使各党派共同产生的政协决议无法实现！这种帝国主义的殖民地政策，中国人民是坚决反对的！”诗人柴光说：“如美军仍不撤退，则全中国人民将对美政府产生一种不可抑止的仇视态度。”新闻界刘沧浪高呼：“我们要请美军赶快退出中国！”律师左国翰指出：“一个独立自由的国家，是绝对不容许任何外国军队驻在自己的领土上。”此外，尚有重庆市银行公会理事长范众渠、中国农村研究会渝分会周永林、文化界力扬、沈起予、何鲁、甘祠森等，一致要求美政府退出驻华美军，并停止对国民党政府的一切援助。
