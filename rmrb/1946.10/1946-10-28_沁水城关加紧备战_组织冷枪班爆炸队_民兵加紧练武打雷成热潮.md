　　【This newspaper, Yangcheng, 26th dispatch】Since the Chiang Kai-shek troops occupied Fushan and Yicheng, Qinshui (east of Yicheng) has entered a state of intense war preparation. Chengguan town has organized a sniper squad and a demolition brigade, and is now making thunder day and night, having made more than a thousand. Each militiaman has at least one stone mine. Making thunder has now become a craze. People do farm work during the day and make thunder at night, practicing blasting. The workers in barbershops and bathhouses are also making thunder shells at night. Women are making detonator tubes and mine-pulling ropes, and digging landmine pits on roadsides and street corners. The militia is practicing throwing grenades, using terrain and landforms to practice sniping, and building landmine fortifications. The Shangfa Village Elementary School cut 10,250 catties of artemisia on October 5th to burn ash for gunpowder.

    【本报阳城廿六日电】自蒋军侵占浮山、翼城后，沁水（翼城东）已进入紧张备战。城关镇已组织了冷枪班和爆炸大队，现正日夜打雷，已打成一千余个，每个民兵至少都有一个石雷。现打雷已形成一种热潮，白天做地活，晚上就打雷，练习爆炸。理发所和澡塘的工友们晚上也在打雷壳，妇女在制爆发管与拉雷绳，并在路边街口都挖好地雷坑。民兵正在练习投弹，利用地形地物演习冷枪，筑地雷工事。上阀村小学校于十月五日割了一万零二百五十斤蒿，烧灰做炸药。
