　　Headquarters of the Jilu Yu Rear Area
    Decides on Methods for Combat Support Work

    [Our newspaper Jilu Yu 20th dispatch] In order to reduce the waste of civilian labor, better mobilize the masses to support the self-defense front, and achieve a complete victory in the patriotic self-defense war, the Headquarters of the Jilu Yu Rear Area, based on the experience of combat support work in September, has formulated the following methods: (1) Establish logistics organizations with a command-political-supply-health nature, renamed Frontline Offices, establishing a deep supply line based on the troop system. These are jointly managed by the military sub-districts and the troops, with cadres assigned to lead them under the command of the Headquarters. They are also under troop command. Under the director and the political commissars are departments for supply and transport, mobilization, general affairs, and hygiene. To strengthen propaganda and education, a political organ is specially established to manage education, stretcher and vehicle management, and the transfer of prisoners; (2) Supply and transport issues: 1. The principle for grain is to obtain it locally, through on-site collection and dispersal. Supply is basically organized at the county and district level. When troops arrive in a county, the frontline office there will prepare grain with the county. When troops move, the supplies will be dispersed locally, mobilizing people, but not goods. However, each soldier should bring two days' worth of rations, after which the office is fully responsible. Fodder is also obtained locally; 2. Oil and salt are to be purchased and transported by industrial and commercial bureaus at all levels, which should be considered a major task. Tools are to be prepared by the troops themselves; 3. Wagons: ensure that each troop has ×× wagons, based on the standard of self-purchased military vehicles, returning civilian vehicles. Drivers are mobilized through administrative means, equivalent to joining the army, with the same treatment as soldiers. For distances within thirty *li*, transport is entirely the responsibility of the troops' vehicles. For distances beyond thirty *li*, local transport is responsible for relaying. This ensures that food is available at any time, while avoiding casualties to people and livestock. Spare vehicles must go through Headquarters procedures, and indiscriminate requisitioning is absolutely prohibited. The troops themselves are responsible for transporting cotton clothing; (3) Stretcher issues: To resolve the contradiction of running around a lot but using little: 1. Divide into two types: one is the accompanying stretcher, each stretcher can reduce three people, because the journey is not far, five people are enough, to persist until the end of a battle, the boundary is from the front line to the first line office surgical team, which can transport back and forth, one kind is a long-distance stretcher, from the first line office straight to the rear field hospital, which are counted as a single trip, but need to mobilize and explain the mission in advance, to form a team. Each troop is only allowed × hundred standby stretchers; 2. Cadres and the masses must execute the completion certificate, which is jointly controlled by the offices of the military sub-districts and the rear hospitals, with the time and signature noted on the certificate to stabilize the morale of the masses; 3. The control and use of stretchers should be the responsibility of both the army and the locality, especially the army should pay more attention to the lives and safety of the masses, and the quality of stretchers and vehicles should be based on army commendation; (4) It is absolutely forbidden to seize people and vehicles. All troops must conduct civilian work, on the one hand, to publicize to the masses the need to carry out guerrilla warfare, clear the fields, and strengthen mass discipline; on the other hand, the local authorities must immediately carry out combat mobilization education.

　　冀鲁豫后方总指挥部
    订出战勤工作办法
    【本报冀鲁豫二十日电】冀鲁豫后方总指挥部为减少民力浪费，更好动员群众支援自卫前线，求得爱国自卫战争的彻底胜利，特根据九月份战勤工作经验，订出以下办法：（一）建立司政供卫性质的兵站组织，改名为前方办事处，以部队系统为标准，建立纵深供应线，由分区及部队共同管理指派干部领导，由指挥部领导，也属部队指挥，在主任及正副政委下设供运、动员、总务卫生等科。为加强宣传教育，特设一政治机关，负责管理教育、担架车辆、和转运俘虏（二）供运问题：一、粮食以就地取给为原则，就地领取和疏散。基本上以县区为单位供给，部队到那县，由该第一线办事处与该县筹备粮食，部队转移时，即就地分散，动人不动物。但部队每人得自带两天给养，两天后完全由办事处负责。马料同样就地取给；二、油盐，由各级工商局负责购买，组织运输，应当成主要工作，工具由各部队自己筹备；三、大车，保证各部队有××辆，以自买军用车为标准，放回民车。车夫由行政力量动员，等于参军，相当于战士待遇。在三十里内所需之车，完全由部队车负责运输，三十里外者，由地方转运，这样做到随时有饭吃，而又避免人、牲畜之伤亡。零用车，一定经过指挥部手续，绝对禁止随便抓车。棉衣运送部队自己解决。（三）担架问题：为解决跑多用少的矛盾：一、分成两种，一种是随军担架，每付担架可减少三人，因为路途不远五个人即可，要坚持到一个战斗的结束为止，界限是从前线到第一线办事处手术组，可来回转运，一种是长途担架，从第一线办事处一直抬到后方野战医院为止，这种都算一趟差，但需事先动员好说明任务，编成队。每个部队只许×百付常备担架；二、干部群众都要执行完工证，由各分区办事处和后方医院共同掌握，证上注有时间、签名，以安定群众情绪；三、担架的掌握与使用，要靠军队地方双方负责，特别是军队要更多关心群众生活及安全，担架车辆之好坏，要以部队表扬为标准。（四）绝对禁止抓人，抓车，各部队要作民运工作，一方面向群众宣传要进行游击战争，空舍清野，加强群众纪律；另一方面地方上要立即进行战斗动员教育。
