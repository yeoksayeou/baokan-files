　　【This newspaper, Changzhi, 15th dispatch】In Heshun, the scale and depth of the mass emancipation movement over the past fifty days has exceeded that of this spring. In the new district, thirteen villages, including Dongguan and Beiliyang, have achieved "land to the tiller." Middle and poor peasants now own five to five and a half mu of land. Another twenty-eight villages have launched another wave of liquidation struggles to resolve many of the issues left over from the mass movement this spring, but it is still not very thorough. Except for six villages that have not yet been mobilized, the rest have entered the liquidation struggle against traitors and despotic landlords. The masses involved in the movement reached more than 12,500 people. The farmers' association has newly developed more than 1,700 people, and the number of activists has increased to 1,767. More than 13,300 problems have been discovered and resolved, most of which are debt problems. The peasants have recovered a total of 13,408 mu of land, 582 head of livestock, and more than 2,200 shi of grain. The movement has greatly united the middle peasants. Middle peasants account for 52 percent of the households that benefited. The cadres' past complacency and "good enough" mentality have also been greatly overcome in the movement. The biggest problem facing the county currently is the imbalance of the movement. The land problem of peasants in most villages has not been completely resolved. It is still necessary to overcome the new complacency of some comrades and continue to work hard to achieve the universal and thorough realization of "land to the tiller."
　　【This newspaper, Tunliu, dispatch】Tunliu Second District has overcome its past reluctance to trust the masses and has boldly mobilized the masses. The general liquidation movement against traitors and despotic landlords in the entire district has rapidly reached a climax. In the eight days from the 3rd to the 10th, the masses in twenty-six villages raised more than 3,100 questions of various kinds. In addition to the problems of bullies, corruption, and usury, land problems accounted for more than 1,000, of which two-thirds have been resolved. The masses have recovered their lost land in accordance with the law. Lu Village, the most backward village in the past, has immediately changed. The "honest" peasants who were reluctant to speak out have also become active and automatically participated in the turn-over teams for liquidation. When the village struggled against the despotic landlord Yang Quankai, more than 130 people raised various questions about his embezzlement of warehouse grain and the usurious exploitation of peasants. Wei Peifu, who had sheltered him in the past, took out the赃物 he had hidden in his own home and handed it over to the masses. Other big and small accomplices who hid赃物 also handed them over one after another, and many activists emerged. The comrade who led the work in the village said: "In the past, I was always worried that there was not a single activist in this village, and the movement could not be carried out; this time, as soon as we let go for a few days, the masses all stood up, and everyone is stronger and more resourceful than us!" The masses in Yuli, Dongxingwang, Cuishao and other villages (villages where the work was better in the past), immediately re-launched a fierce struggle as soon as they heard the slogan of thoroughly liquidating and implementing land reform.

　　做到村村实现耕者有其田
    和顺努力争取平衡
    屯留二区克服束手束脚群运获新进展
    【本报长治十五日电】和顺近五十日来的群众翻身运动规模与深度超过今春。新区共四百一十七村达到耕者有其田的有东关、北李阳等十三村。中贫农均已有土地五亩到五亩半。另有二十八个村再度掀起清算斗争，解决今春群运中遗留问题甚多，但仍不甚彻底。其余除六个村尚未发动外，都已进入反奸霸地主的清算斗争，卷入运动的群众，达一万二千五百余人。农会新发展一千七百余人，积极分子增加到一千七百六十七人。发现与解决的问题达一万三千三百余件，其中以债务问题为多。农民共收回土地一万三千四百零八亩，牲口五百八十二头，粮食二千二百余石，运动中大大的团结了中农。得果实户中，中农占百分之五十二。干部过去的自满情绪与“差不多”思想，在运动中亦大大克服。该县当前最大问题为运动的不平衡。大部村庄农民土地问题尚未彻底解决。仍须克服部分同志新的自满情绪，继续努力，以达普遍彻底实现耕者有其田。
    【本报屯留讯】屯留二区克服了过去不相信群众的束手束脚作风放手发动群众，全区对奸霸地主的总清算运动迅速走上高潮。二十六个村的群众从三日至十日的八天中，提出各种问题三千一百多件，除恶霸、贪污、高利贷等问题外，土地问题即占一千多件，其中三分之二已获解决，群众纷纷依法收回失去土地。过去最落后的路村，立时改观，不啃气的“老实”农民也活跃起来，自动参加翻身组进行清算。该村斗争恶霸地主杨全凯时，一百三十多个群众提出他贪污仓谷及大利盘剥农民的各种问题，过去包庇他的魏培夫，首先把他藏在自己家中的赃物拿出来，交给群众，其他藏赃物的大小走狗也都纷纷交出，涌现了许多积极分子。领导该村工作的同志说：“过去老发愁这村没一个积极分子，运动搞不起来；这回刚放手几天，群众就都起来了，那一个也比咱强，比咱有办法！”峪里、东兴旺、崔邵等村（过去工作较好的村子）群众，一听到彻底清算，实行土地改革的口号，也立即重新掀起了猛烈的斗争。
