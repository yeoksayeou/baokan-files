　　An Appeal to the United Nations General Assembly
　　*Liberation Daily* Editorial, 24th
　　The first United Nations General Assembly convenes today at Lake Success, New York. We, representing the 450 million people of China, wish this assembly success.

　　Whether considering the interests of China or world peace, the Chinese people are concerned about one of the important issues of this assembly: the withdrawal of troops of UN member states stationed in the territories of non-former enemy countries. The purpose of the United Nations organization is to maintain international peace and security and to ensure that countries do not interfere in each other's internal affairs to avoid international conflicts. Any actions by any country that violate this charter should be subject to the intervention and restraint of the United Nations. Chapter 1, Article 1 of the UN Charter stipulates "The Purposes of the United Nations" as "To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace." Article 2 stipulates "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations." What the Chinese people are facing now are precisely several situations that violate the UN Charter. For the past year, the United States' armed intervention in China's internal affairs has constituted an infringement on China's "territorial integrity and political independence" and a "situation" threatening "international peace and security." We hope that this UN General Assembly can effectively stop this situation, so that the United Nations does not repeat the mistakes of the League of Nations at the beginning and lose its responsibility to oppressed nations.

　　As the world knows, after Japan's surrender, the U.S. government directly, and through the hands of the traitorous and dictatorial Chiang Kai-shek fascist regime in China, carried out acts of aggression against China. If we summarize, then the facts of the United States' infringement on China's "territorial integrity and political independence" and threats to "international peace and security" in China over the past year are approximately as follows:

　　First, the U.S. government has massively equipped, trained, and transported Kuomintang troops into the North China, Central China, and Northeast China regions already liberated by the Communist army to carry out a civil war to slaughter the Chinese people. To date, the U.S. has equipped and trained sixty divisions for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous dictatorial regime (of which only twenty divisions were equipped on the eve of Japan's surrender). The Kuomintang troops transported by the U.S. Navy and Air Force to the front lines of the civil war have reached thirteen armies, totaling 500,000 men. Obviously, without the U.S. authorities' significant military assistance to Chiang Kai-shek, the Kuomintang warlords would not have these American-equipped troops today, and of course, it would be even more impossible to transport these troops to the front lines of the liberated areas to conduct a civil war.

　　Second, after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the U.S. government has consistently continued the Lend-Lease Act for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous dictatorial regime, supplying Chiang Kai-shek's army with equipment such as airplanes, artillery, tanks, ammunition, and even docks, communications, medicine, clothing, etc., to carry out a war to slaughter the Chinese people. According to figures released by the U.S., the amount of aid to Chiang that can be verified is over 4 billion U.S. dollars, exceeding six to seven times the total of over 600 million U.S. dollars of U.S. aid to China during the entire war against Japan. Chiang Kai-shek has sold China's territorial land, territorial waters, territorial airspace, inland rivers, military, financial economy, transportation, and other major powers to the U.S. authorities as a price.

　　Third, the United States has long-term and large-scale stationing of troops in China, undermining China's territorial sovereignty and integrity. Within a month and a half after the surrender of the Japanese invaders, 53,000 U.S. Marines landed successively in key ports such as Tianjin and Qingdao in North China. At this time, the massive U.S. Seventh Fleet also successively entered the ports of North China. These troops then built roads, guarded roads, garrisoned cities, built bases, trained naval and air personnel in northern China (where the liberated areas were mainly located), deployed a network of U.S. military bases in China, and openly armed invasions, and occupied towns in the liberated areas. The U.S. official has repeatedly stated that this army will withdraw once the Japanese prisoners of war in China have been repatriated. Now, the Japanese prisoners of war have been officially announced by the U.S. in mid-July, but the U.S. military in China has violated the agreement and has not withdrawn.

　　Fourth, the U.S. military in China continues to trample on Chinese human rights in various parts of China, massacring peaceful Chinese residents, raping Chinese women, and robbing Chinese stores and goods. In Tianjin, the U.S. Navy even grabbed a nine-year-old Chinese girl and threw her into the river for no reason. Chinese public opinion has widely recognized these barbaric and cruel behaviors as exceeding the degree of the Japanese army. Zhang Dongsun, one of China's leading liberal figures and a professor at Yenching University, recently said: "The U.S. military stationed in China... the military discipline is getting worse every day. They drink, gamble, prostitute, steal, buy by force, rob, arbitrarily beat people, kill people, hit people with cars, and arbitrarily insult and rape Chinese women every day... Every U.S. soldier stationed in China has become a rogue, a gangster, committing all kinds of evil, doing whatever they want, and it has become a habit."

　　Fifth, the U.S. military openly tramples and attacks the Chinese liberated areas. The U.S. military has directly and in coordination with the Chiang puppet army openly occupied Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Liushouying in the Jidong liberated area, which had been liberated by the Eighth Route Army, and Anping Town, which was occupied on July 29 this year. As for the U.S. military aircraft openly harassing residents in the liberated areas, shooting at residents, demonstrating at low altitude, and cooperating with the Chiang puppet army to attack the liberated areas, the number is countless.

　　Sixth, is helping the Chiang Kai-shek fascist regime establish a huge secret police force to carry out evil terrorist activities against the Chinese people and the liberated areas. This assistance is under the name of the "Sino-American Cooperative Organization," and the U.S. Naval Intelligence Agency helped Chiang Kai-shek establish a huge modern intelligence organization. This kind of secret agent rule has become the main way for Chiang Kai-shek to rule the Chinese people. Li Gongpu, a famous mass educator and democrat, and Wen Yiduo, a famous poet and professor, were killed in Kunming in July this year by this Chiang Kai-shek secret service organization fostered by the United States, and the murder weapon used was exactly the silent pistol borrowed from the U.S. secret service organization.

　　In the past year, the above-mentioned aggressive behaviors carried out by the U.S. authorities in China have not only completely treated China as a colony, seriously infringing on the sacred and inviolable "territorial integrity and political independence" of the Chinese people, but also have in fact constituted a serious threat to "international peace and security." Because the United States is building its base for aggression against China, monopolizing China, and preparing for the Third World War in key coastal areas of China.

　　Therefore, our hope for the General Assembly is:

　　(1) Condemn the unjust behavior of the U.S. government authorities in armed interference in China's internal affairs over the past year, and demand that the U.S. government unconditionally fulfill the obligations of a UN member state, immediately withdraw all U.S. troops in China, stop all military and financial assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous civil war dictatorial regime, stop the Lend-Lease Act, recover the remaining U.S. military materials in the Western Pacific and China, recall the U.S. military advisory group in China that is directing Chiang Kai-shek to conduct the civil war, and compensate the Chinese people for the loss of life and property suffered under the atrocities of the U.S. military in China over the past year.

　　(2) If the U.S. authorities are unwilling to fulfill the above conditions, then the UN General Assembly should organize a special committee on Chinese issues to conduct investigations in China, interview the Chinese people and various Chinese parties, conduct on-the-spot inspections of all U.S. authorities' actions in China, and collect the opinions of the vast Chinese people to confirm whether the U.S. authorities' actions in China constitute an infringement on China's "territorial integrity and political independence" and whether they threaten "international peace and security."

　　Finally, we must also tell the representatives of the countries attending the United Nations on behalf of the Chinese people that the so-called Chinese delegation attending the General Assembly is only the representative of the dictator Chiang Kai-shek and his traitorous group. They cannot represent any of the Chinese people at all, just as Roosevelt's era, the U.S. Department of State's overseas service personnel bulletin on October 7, 1944 said: "The Chinese people and the Chongqing warlords (i.e., Chiang Kai-shek) are not of the same type." Therefore, the Chinese people bear no responsibility for any words and deeds of the Chiang Kai-shek delegation at the UN General Assembly that betray the interests of the Chinese nation, and are not bound by them in any way. Therefore, what the UN General Assembly should pay attention to is not the parrot-like repetition of the U.S. authorities by the Chiang Kai-shek representative, a vassal of the United States, but the just voice of the Chinese people, which is clearly expressed in the above two demands.

　　对联合国大会的一个呼吁
    解放日报廿四日社论
    第一届联合国大会，今天在纽约成功湖召开了，我们代表中国四万万五千万人民，预祝这个大会的成功。
    中国人民无论从本国的和世界和平的利益着想，都关心这次大会的重要问题之一，即联合国会员国撤退驻在非前敌国领土内的军队问题。联合国组织的目的，原在维持国际的和平与安全，保证各国之间不得互相干涉内政，以免引起国际冲突；凡属违背这个宪章国家的任何行为，均应受到联合国的干涉与制止。联合国宪章第一章第一条规定“联合国之宗旨”，在“维持国际和平及安全，并为此目的采取有效集体办法，以限止且消除对于和平之威胁，制止侵略行为或其他和平之破坏，并以和平方法、且依正义及国际法之原则，调整或解决足以破坏和平之国际争端或情势”。其第二条又规定“各会员国在其国际关系上，不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立”。现在我们中国人民所遇到的，正是这么几种违反联合国宪章的情况。一年来，美国对华武装干涉中国内政的行为，已经构成了侵害中国的“领土完整与政治独立”，及威胁“国际和平及安全”的“情势”。我们希望这次联合国大会能够切实停止这种情势，使联合国不要在一开始的时候，就重蹈国际联盟的覆辙，丧失对被压迫民族的责任。
    世人皆知的，美国政府于日本投降后，即直接并假中国卖国独裁的蒋介石法西斯政权之手，进行侵略中国的行为。我们如加以总结，则过去一年来，美国在中国所进行的侵害中国的“领土完整及政治独立”与威胁“国际和平及安全”的事实，约有如下几项：
    第一、美国政府大量装备、训练和输送国民党军队进入中共军队已经解放的华北、华中及东北等地区，进行残杀中国人民的内战。迄至目前为止，美国为蒋介石卖国独裁政权装备和训练的军队，已达六十个师（其中仅有二十个师是在日本投降前夜装备的）。由美国的海空两军运输到内战前线的国民党军，已达十三个军，数达五十万人。很明显的，没有美国当局对蒋介石这一重大的军事援助，国民党军阀今天就根本没有这些美械的军队，当然更谈不到把这些军队运往解放区前线进行内战。
    第二、日寇投降后，美国政府至今始终继续对蒋介石卖国独裁政权的军火租借法案，供给蒋介石军队以飞机、大炮、坦克、弹药直至码头、通讯、医药、服装等等的装备，以进行残杀中国人民的战争。这个援蒋的数目字，据美方公布、有案可稽的已在四十万万美元以上，超过整个对日作战期间美国援华物资六万万余元的六至七倍。蒋介石则以中国的领土、领海、领空、内河、军事、财政经济、交通等等大权出卖给美国当局作为代价。
    第三、美国长期大量驻兵中国，破坏中国领土主权完整。在日寇投降的一个半月以后，美国的海军陆战队五万三千人，相继在华北的天津、青岛等要港登陆，美国庞大的第七舰队也于此时相继开入华北的诸港口，这些军队随即在中国北部（那里主要是解放区）为蒋介石军筑路、护路、守备城市、建设基地、训练海空人员，布置美军在华军事基地网及公开武装进犯，并侵占解放区城镇等。这支军队，美国官方屡次声称，一俟在华日俘遣送完毕，即行撤退。现在日俘早已于七月中旬经美官方公布遣送完毕，但在华美军却违约不撤。
    第四、在华美军不断在中国各地蹂躏中国人权，惨杀中国和平居民，奸淫中国妇女，抢劫中国商店货物。在天津的美国海军，竟无端抓起一中国九岁女孩投入河中。这些野蛮残忍的行为，中国舆论界已普遍认为已超过日军的程度。中国著名的自由主义领导人物之一、燕京大学教授张东荪氏最近曾说：“美军驻在中国……军纪一天比一天糟，他们每天随意酗酒赌钱、狎妓、盗卖、强购、抢劫，任意打人、杀人，用汽车撞人，随意污辱和强奸中国妇女……驻华美军个个都成了无赖汉，成了流氓，土匪，为非作歹，胡作胡为，已经变成习惯了。”
    第五、是驻华美军对中国解放区公开的蹂躏与进攻，先后由美军直接并配合蒋伪军公开占领已为八路军解放的冀东解放区的秦皇岛、北戴河、留守营与今年七月二十九日占去的安平镇等。至于美军飞机之在解放区公开的骚扰、射击居民、低空示威与配合蒋伪军向解放区进攻等，更是不计其数。
    第六、是帮助蒋介石法西斯政权建立庞大的秘密警察，对中国人民及解放区进行罪恶的恐怖活动，此种援助系在“中美合作所”的名义之下，由美国海军特务机关帮助蒋介石建立起了庞大的近代化的特务组织，此种特务统治并成为蒋介石统治中国人民的主要方式。中国著名的大众教育家、民主主义者李公朴，著名诗人、教授闻一多两先生，今年七月在昆明被害，就是这一为美国所扶植起来的蒋介石特务机关干的，而且所用的凶器也正是美国特务机关借给的无声手枪。
    一年来，美国当局在中国进行的上述种种侵略行为，不但已把中国完全当作殖民地看待，严重地侵害了中国人民神圣不可侵犯的“领土完整与政治独立”，而且也已在实际上构成了对“国际和平及安全”的严重威胁。因为美国正在中国沿海要地建设其侵略中国、独占中国并准备第三次世界大战的基地。
    因此，我们对大会的希望是：
    （一）谴责美国政府当局一年来武装干涉中国内政的不义的行为，要求美国政府无条件地履行联合国会员国的义务，立即撤退在华一切美军，停止对蒋介石卖国内战独裁政权的一切军事财政的援助，停止租借法案，收回美军在西太平洋及中国的剩余军用物资，召回美国在华指挥蒋介石进行内战的军事顾问团，以及赔偿中国人民一年来在华美军暴行下所受的生命财产的损失等。
    （二）如果美国当局尚不愿履行上述各项条件，那么联合国大会便应该组织中国问题的特别委员会到中国进行调查，访问中国人民及中国各党派，实地视察美国当局在华一切行为，搜集中国广大人民的意见，以证实美国当局在华的行为是否为侵害中国的“领土完整及政治独立”，及是否威胁了“国际的和平及安全”。
    最后，我们还要代表中国人民告诉联合国与会诸国代表一句话，即此次出席大会的所谓中国代表团，仅仅是独裁者蒋介石及其卖国集团的代表，他们根本不能代表中国的任何人民，正如罗斯福时代、一九四四年十月七日美国务院的海外服务人员通报所说：“中国人民与重庆军阀（即蒋介石）不是一个类型”。因此，蒋介石代表团在联合国大会上一切出卖中国民族利益的言行，中国人民对之不负任何责任，并不受任何拘束。因此，联合国大会所应当注意的，便不是美国附庸的蒋介石代表跟美国当局的鹦鹉学舌，而应当是中国人民的正义的呼声，这种呼声就是上述两项要求所明白地表现出来的。
