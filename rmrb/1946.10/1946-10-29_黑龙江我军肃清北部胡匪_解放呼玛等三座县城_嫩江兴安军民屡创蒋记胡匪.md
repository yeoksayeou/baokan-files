Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 26th: A certain unit of the Heilongjiang Provincial Democratic Allied Army has cleared out the bandits in the northern mountainous areas of the province, liberating the three county towns of Huma, Oupu, and Wuyun along the Heilongjiang River, as well as the Hanqida Gold Mine. In three months, this unit defeated the bandit mixed Sixth Brigade in the area of ×Wu, the mixed Eighth Brigade in western Xunhe, and the so-called "Nenbei General Command Headquarters." The security near Heihe is now very consolidated. The highway from Nenjiang to Heihe and the Hanqida Gold Mine is open, with merchants traveling frequently along the way. The Hanqida Gold Mine has resumed work for half a month, with the number of workers increasing to over 900. Democratic regimes have also been established in the liberated counties. In various parts of Chemeng Xing'an Province, bandits recruited by Chiang Kai-shek have been discovered, spreading rumors, looting, and killing everywhere. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Army and civilians are defending the achievements of national autonomy and the people's liberation, actively pursuing and suppressing the "Central Bandits" who are invading. A certain regiment of the Self-Defense Army engaged in over ten battles in September, killing or wounding 130 bandits, capturing 45, and pacifying over 300 landowners who had gone astray with their armed forces, seizing over 100 war horses and 50 rifles.

Xinhua News Agency, Northeast, 23rd: People in various parts of Nenjiang Province are cooperating with the army to launch an anti-bandit movement. The habitual bandits Wang Naidong and Zhang Mingjiu's troops (commissioned by Peng Jiqun, Chairman of the Kuomintang Nenjiang Province), have been scattered by the people's armed forces. Over 100 bandits armed by Wang Kefu and Fu Jinsheng from the Lishugang area of Du'erbo Banner were wiped out in one fell swoop, and all five bandit leaders were killed. The habitual bandit Ju Sheng's troops, commissioned by the Chiang side as the Seventh Reserve Brigade of the Central Army, were also severely attacked and scattered. In mid-August, the bandit troops of Liu Mingjiu and Chen Guo＠ (appointed as commander and deputy commander of the cavalry regiment by the Changchun Kuomintang authorities) in eastern Tailai were severely attacked by the people's armed forces, with most of them annihilated, and the bandit leader Chen Guo＠ was captured. In addition, the bandit troops of Guo Wen and Qi Kun in the San Zhao (Zhaodong, Zhaoyuan, Zhaozhou) area, and the bandit troops of Zhang Bojun in the Nenbei area, have all been severely damaged. In many bandit suppression wars, the Mongolian people's armed forces in Zhalantun, Longjiang County, and Yikeming'an Banner have also made many contributions. The armies and civilians in various regions have shown unparalleled heroism in suppressing bandits. A squad of twelve soldiers from the self-defense army in a certain district of Zhaozhou defeated 380 bandits, and was commended by the military region. Yang Zijiu, a female cadre in Anguang County, led a small number of militiamen to intercept seventy to eighty bandits, winning praise from the masses. When the villages of Landebude and Xiwopu in Zhaodong County were attacked by bandits, men and women, young and old, gathered together to fight bravely, persevering and ultimately hitting the bandits with their homemade cannons.
