Recently, 10 renowned traditional Chinese medicine experts in Beijing gave their approval to a series of aromatic medical and health care products developed by Chen Fuxin, a researcher at the Institute of Chinese Medicine under the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. They believe that while oral Chinese medicine is bitter, the aromatic essence of externally applied Chinese medicine permeates the body and reaches the meridians—this is a principle that has been clinically verified by medical practitioners throughout history: "The logic of external treatment is the same as that of internal treatment."

The institute has already launched products such as the Sleepwell Pillow, the Nurturing Pillow, the Warm Aromatic Mattress Pad, the Warm Aromatic Vest, and the Fragrant Bag, which respectively have the functions of clearing the liver and benefiting the heart, calming the mind and stabilizing the will, aiding movement and supporting strength, warming the kidneys and strengthening the spleen, relaxing the tendons and activating the meridians, warming the waist and strengthening the kidneys, and dispelling wind and brightening the eyes.

　　中药外治内治殊途同归
    芳香医疗保健系列制品面世
    本报讯  日前，１０位在京的中医药名家对中国中医研究院中药研究所研究员陈馥馨研究出的系列芳香医疗保健制品给予肯定。他们认为：内服中药口苦，外用中药芳香之气在体内走串达络——这是历代医家临床都证实的“外治之理，即内治之理”。
    这个所已推出的失眠乐药枕、育英枕、暖香褥、暖香坎肩和清雅香囊，分别有清肝益心、安神定志、助动扶赢、温肾健脾、舒筋活络、暖腰固肾、祛风明目等功用。
