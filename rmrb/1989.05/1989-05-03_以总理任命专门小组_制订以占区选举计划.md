Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 2nd.

According to news from Jerusalem today, Israeli Prime Minister Shamir has appointed a special group to draft a blueprint for implementing his plan to hold elections in the occupied territories.

According to the Prime Minister's spokesman, Yossi Ahimeir, this group is led by Shamir's senior advisor, Joseph Ben-Aron.

The spokesman said that the newly appointed group will present detailed suggestions to the Ministerial Committee on the tactical advantages and disadvantages of holding elections, and then the Committee will present the final plan to the Cabinet.

Shamir proposed the election plan during his visit to the United States last month. However, Palestinians both inside and outside the occupied territories have opposed Shamir's election plan, demanding that elections be held under international supervision and after Israeli troops withdraw.

　　以总理任命专门小组    
    制订以占区选举计划
    新华社开罗５月２日电  据今天来自耶路撒冷的消息，以色列总理沙米尔任命一个专门小组，以制订实施其在被占领土上举行选举计划的蓝图。
    据总理发言人尤西·阿希梅厄说，这个小组由沙米尔的高级顾问约瑟夫·本—阿龙领导。
    据这位发言人说，新任命的小组将向部长委员会提出详细介绍举行选举战术上利弊的建议，再由这个委员会向内阁提出最后计划。
    沙米尔是在上月访问美国时提出选举计划的。但是，被占领土内外的巴勒斯坦人都反对沙米尔的选举计划，要求在国际监督和以色列撤军的情况下举行选举。
