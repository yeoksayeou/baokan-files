	NATO's New Trends
	— Prospects for the NATO Summit
	Li Yiyan

	As the situation between the United States and the Soviet Union and between the East and the West is undergoing a turning point, the NATO organization will hold a summit meeting on May 29-30 to officially celebrate its 40th anniversary. The meeting will mainly discuss the formulation of the alliance's "common guidelines." The results and impact of this meeting, especially the future direction of this military-political group, are attracting worldwide attention.

	Facing New Challenges

	NATO is a product of the post-war "Cold War" between the East and the West. However, the changes that have taken place in the Soviet Union in recent years and the development of the new détente between the East and the West, especially Gorbachev's announcement of unilateral disarmament and the opening of negotiations on conventional disarmament in Europe, have subjected NATO's "foundation of existence" to unprecedented "shocks." First, the "goal consciousness" that maintains NATO's political unity is "weakening." Now, the majority of the public in Western European countries believe that the Cold War has ended, the Soviet military threat has decreased, and the idea that the Soviet Union might invade Western Europe is "incredible," leading to a decrease in support for increasing defense spending and an increasing demand for disarmament. Second, the contradictions and conflicts between the alliance's different strategic interests are further developing and being exposed. Although the basic military principles and established military preparedness of NATO are generally consistent, due to different situations and strategic interests, the assessments of Soviet changes are not the same, resulting in obvious differences in strategies. There are mainly two tendencies: one tendency emphasizes gradual progress, cautious advancement, expanding goals, controlling the "pace," maintaining pressure, and promoting change; the other tendency emphasizes active participation, seizing the opportunity, helping with reforms, promoting reconciliation, and using reconciliation to promote change and shape a new order. The differences between these two tendencies are reflected to varying degrees in a series of issues in East-West relations, affecting the unity of the alliance. Third, recent disputes over the short-range missile issue reflect new characteristics that suggest that the rifts within NATO will deepen and expand. These new characteristics are: the contradictions within the alliance are more complex; the demands and advocacy for arms reduction, opposition to nuclear weapons, and the arms race are having a profound impact on the domestic politics of some Western European allies; and as the economically strongest but politically long-suppressed Federal Republic of Germany, begins to demand changes and improvements in its strategic position and political influence.

	The Direction of the 1990s

	The summit meeting, which has been prepared after much deliberation, is an important meeting for NATO countries to bridge the gaps within the alliance, coordinate positions, determine the strategic direction of NATO in the new situation, and formulate "common guidelines." According to NATO Secretary-General Werner, "the most important thing will be to issue a political declaration." It seems that this political declaration is likely to be a document that some European and American strategic think tanks have suggested the summit should formulate in recent times, similar to the "Harmel Report" of 1967, which determined NATO's "overall strategy." It plans the "overall strategy" for NATO in the 1990s, referred to as the "Second Harmel Report." It is generally estimated that its content may involve the following aspects: (1) Analysis of the characteristics and development trends of the global situation and the current state of East-West relations; (2) Clarification of the nature of relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and the proposal of greater goals than in the past, as well as the possible paths and principles for achieving these goals; (3) A comprehensive elaboration of NATO's security concept, reaffirming the continued adherence to nuclear deterrence and NATO's established strategy, and explaining NATO's arms reduction and arms control policies and goals, as well as their relationship with security. It may also propose some initiatives; (4) To ensure the unity of the alliance, it may determine the order of consultations between the allies to ensure that the United States will not negotiate with the Soviet Union on issues related to the "future of Europe" without coordination.

	Several Estimations

	From the problems that the summit meeting is going to solve and the policy trends of NATO countries, the direction of NATO in the 1990s can be roughly estimated as follows:

	(1) Adjusting, enriching, and developing NATO's "overall strategy," expanding its political tasks and roles.

	Mainly: (1) Putting politics on an equal footing with the military, and possibly gradually shifting towards a more political direction. The 1967 "Harmel Report" first clearly stated that NATO has two main functions, namely defense and détente. Although they are listed together, in reality, defense is the main focus, and détente is only an important "supplement." In the future, NATO's tasks "will not only be devoted to the defense and unity of the alliance but also to promoting democracy and human rights." (2) Proposing greater goals for NATO's political tasks. The "Harmel Report" pointed out, "Détente is not the ultimate goal... The highest political goal of the alliance is a just, lasting, and secure new order in Europe." NATO will expand this "ultimate goal" to establish a "new order in Europe" based on the promotion of "democracy and freedom," and propose higher conditions for achieving reconciliation in East-West relations and establishing a "more cooperative" relationship. (3) From the adjustment of NATO's "overall strategy," in terms of politics and ideology, the offensive factors are obviously increasing and are supported by its economic means. In this sense, the Western ideology is not "diminishing" but is strengthening.

	(2) To adapt to the development of East-West economic relations and the international economic competition situation, the NATO alliance will also expand its economic "coordination" role.

	First, coordinate the policies of the allied countries in developing economic relations with the Eastern bloc countries. Promote reforms and openness linked to Eastern European countries. Second, given that the European Community will establish a "unified internal market" in 1992, economic friction between the United States and Europe will increase. To handle economic issues between the United States and Europe in a way that does not "harm security," NATO may also be used as an institution to coordinate its positions.

	(3) NATO will continue to maintain a strong defense, adhere to nuclear deterrence and flexible response strategy, and under this condition, gradually strengthen conventional deterrence with new technology; at the same time, gradually strengthen the construction of NATO's "European pillar."

	In the long term, as East-West European relations continue to develop in the direction of the current turning point, the rifts within NATO will deepen and expand, and the alliance may gradually become more dispersed. However, this will be a slow process. In the medium term, this summit meeting will begin to adjust, enrich, and develop NATO's "overall strategy" and improve U.S.-European relations. This may have a certain role in coordinating the alliance's strategic stance towards the Soviet Union and easing internal tensions (including resolving the short-range missile dispute through compromise). Especially, its impact and role on the direction of NATO in the 1990s are more noteworthy.

　　北约的新动向
    ——展望北约首脑会议
    李以衍
    在美苏和东西方关系正在发生转折性变化的形势下，北约组织将于５月２９—３０日召开首脑会议，正式庆祝其成立４０周年。会议将主要讨论制定联盟的“共同纲领”。这次会议的结果与影响，特别是这个军事政治集团今后的走向，正在引起世人的关注。
  面临的新挑战
    北约组织是战后东西方之间进行“冷战”的产物。但是，这几年苏联发生的变化和东西方新缓和形势的发展，特别是戈尔巴乔夫宣布单方面裁军和欧洲常规裁军谈判的开场，使北约“存在的基础”受到前所未有的“冲击”。一是使北约保持政治团结基础的“目标意识”正在“削弱”。现在西欧国家“大多数公众认为冷战已经结束”，“苏联军事威胁已经减少”，苏联可能入侵西欧之说“难以置信”，从而导致支持增加防务开支的人在减少，而要求裁军的压力则不断加重。二是盟国之间不同战略利益的矛盾进一步发展和暴露。现在联盟内部对北约的基本军事原则和既定的军事战备所持立场，虽然基本一致，但是由于各自的处境和战略利益不同，对苏联变化的估计也不一，因而在对策上存在明显差别，主要有两种倾向：一种倾向侧重于以缓制猝，谨慎进取，扩大目标，控制“节奏”，保持压力，坚持促变；另一种倾向则强调积极参与，不失时机，帮助改革，促进和解，以和促变，塑新秩序。这两种倾向之间的分歧，不同程度反映在东西方关系的一系列问题上，影响着联盟的团结。三是最近在短导问题上争吵反映的新特点预示着北约内部的裂痕还将加深与扩大。这些新特点是：联盟内部矛盾更加错综复杂；争取裁军、反对核武器和军备竞赛的要求与主张，正在西欧一些盟国的内部政治中发生深刻的影响；作为西欧经济实力最强、而政治上在联盟内又长期受“抑制”的联邦德国，开始要求改变和提高它的战略地位和政治影响。
  ９０年代的走向
    经过再三酝酿准备的这次北约首脑会议，是北约各国为弥合联盟内部分歧、协调立场、确定新形势下北约今后的战略方向、制定“共同纲领”的重要会议。据北约秘书长韦尔纳说，“最重要的将是发表一个政治宣言”。看来，这个政治宣言很可能就是一个时期以来欧美一些战略智囊人物所建议要首脑会议制定的一个文件，类似１９６７年确定北约“总体战略”的“哈默尔报告”，规划９０年代北约“总体战略”，称之为“第二个哈默尔报告”，一般估计，其内容可能涉及以下几个方面：（１）对全球形势的特点和发展趋势以及东西方关系的现状的分析；（２）明确对苏联和东欧关系的性质，并提出比过去更大的目标以及实现其目标的可能途径和原则；（３）全面阐述北约的安全概念，重申继续坚持核威慑和北约既定的战略，并阐明北约的裁军和军备控制政策与目标及其与安全的关系，也可能会提出一些倡议；（４）为确保联盟的团结，可能确定盟国之间进行磋商的秩序，以保证美国不会越顶同苏联讨论有关“欧洲的未来”。
  几点估计
    从首脑会议要解决的问题联系北约国家政策趋向看，对北约９０年代的走向大致可作以下估计：
    （一）调整、充实和发展北约的“总体战略”，扩大其政治任务与作用。
    主要是：（１）把政治放到与军事并重的地位，并可能逐渐向侧重于政治的方向发展。１９６７年“哈默尔报告”，首次明确北约有两个主要职能，即防务加缓和。两者虽然并列，但实际上是以防务为主，缓和只是作为重要的“补充”。今后北约的任务“不仅要致力于联盟的防务和团结，而且要促进民主和人权”。（２）对北约政治任务提出更大的目标。“哈默尔报告”曾指出，“缓和不是最终的目标……联盟的最高政治目标是一个公正的、持久的、具有安全保障的欧洲新秩序”。北约将要扩大这一“最终目标”，要在促进“民主和自由”的基础上建立“欧洲新秩序”，并对实现东西方关系的“和解”和建立“比较合作”的关系提出更高的条件。（３）从北约调整“总体战略”看，就政治和思想领域而言，进攻性因素明显增加，并得到其经济手段的支持。从这个意义上讲，西方的意识形态，不是在“淡化”，而是在加强。
    （二）为适应东西方经济关系的发展和国际经济竞争形势，北约联盟还将扩大其经济“协调”作用。
    一是协调盟国之间发展同东方集团国家经济关系的政策。推行同东欧国家改革与开放挂钩。二是鉴于１９９２年欧洲共同体将建立“统一内部市场”，美欧经济摩擦将会增加，为使欧美之间以“不损害安全”的方式处理经济问题，可能把北约也作为协调其立场的机构。
    （三）北约将继续保持强大的防务，坚持核威慑和灵活反应战略，并在此条件下，逐步以新技术加强常规的威慑力量；与此同时，逐步加强北约“欧洲支柱”的建设。
    从长远看，随着欧洲东西方关系继续朝正在转折的方向发展，北约内部的裂痕还会加深和扩大，联盟也可能会逐渐趋于松散。不过这将是一个缓慢的过程。从中短期看，这次首脑会议开始调整、充实和发展北约的“总体战略”和改进美欧关系，这对协调联盟国家对苏战略的立场以及缓和内部紧张关系（包括以折衷妥协办法解决短导之争问题），可能会起一定作用。特别是它对北约９０年代走向的影响与作用，更值得注意。
