	Literature and Enlightenment
	Gao Ertai
	1986-12

	At the end of 1986, *Youth Writers* published a short excerpt from a recording of my conversation with Bei Dao. Fortunately, it was not long, and is transcribed as follows:

	Gao Ertai: What is called poetry is nothing more than using the power of one's own soul to shake the souls of others. Using the heat of one's own passion to ignite the passions of others. Anyone who can do this is an excellent poet.

	Bei Dao: But as a poet, one should add a little color to the art itself, enrich the kingdom of poetry, and advance the history of poetry a step forward, before one can talk about being excellent.

	Gao Ertai: Any kingdom can only be built on the land of real life. Any history is only a part of the process of human progress. The kingdom of poetry and the history of poetry are no exception.

	Bei Dao: But the pursuit of poetry is not a utilitarian pursuit. The purpose and ideals of poetry should be higher than the purposes and ideals in real life.

	Gao Ertai: But they have already turned ideals and purposes into poetry.

	Bei Dao: Isn't that alienation?

	Gao Ertai: You can be proud of your closeness to the sun, and they can be proud of their closeness to the earth.

	Bei Dao is a pioneer, and his poetry is the first thunder of the current flourishing modern poetry. His views on poetry are also the forerunner of the currently popular "pure literature" theory. Because of their pursuit of beauty—the sun of the poetic kingdom, they have now flown very high.

	But poetry is a creation of the human spirit. The sun of the poetic kingdom can only exist in the spiritual universe. Many kings of the poetic kingdom, both ancient and modern, including our contemporary Bei Dao, have been difficult and lonely in real life. "When times are hard, one is despised by the common eye; there has never been anyone as poor as you." Of course, sometimes there are cheers, flowers, and thunderous applause. But all of this does not change their fate in the slightest. "Talent fills the heavens and earth, but one's life is old and dusty"—this is not just true of Li Bai.

	The spirit is a human thing, a human creation and function, a human mode of existence and tool for action. It constantly negates and renews itself, accumulating like cultural history and sprouting like future landscapes, thus endowing our present lives with multi-faceted and multi-layered values and meanings. The sensory, intuitive "grasp" of such values and meanings, not a passive "reflection" but a subjective, active, participatory "grasp," is creation, is aesthetics, is the lever that makes the sun of the poetic kingdom rise. It cannot be separated from the fulcrum of our present lives.

	Just as the force that governs the material universe is energy, the force that governs the spiritual universe is beauty—the sun of the poetic kingdom. Beauty has the power to transform the world because it symbolizes our yearning for, and the possibility of achieving through our efforts, a certain optimal mode of our existence. It thus guides us to transcend the present and move towards the future, making our present lives appear absurd. For this reason, we regard the consciousness of absurdity, as well as the corresponding feelings of pain, reality, and mission, as active aesthetic consciousness.

	In other words, the sun in the spiritual universe, as a torch burning at the intersection of past and future, of nothingness and existence, would be dim and lose its meaning and basis if it had nothing to illuminate, if it had nothing to illuminate of our present, real lives. Why are the readers of "pure literature" becoming fewer and fewer? Because in such a tumultuous and mysterious age, it cannot provide a small lantern to light the path beneath people's feet, cannot provide a world of meaning to guide thousands of people out of their confusion.

	Thus, there is a man-made contradiction: the more authors pursue "art," the farther they are from art. The farther one is from life, the farther one is from art. The farther one is from the earth, the farther one is from the sun. The current trend in the literary world of pursuing the "Nobel complex" and "going global" is the most striking example of this distance. If our psychological motivation rooted in real life is strong enough to make us pick up the pen to write regardless of the consequences, how could we be interested in distinguishing between foreign praise and criticism? Even if being more transcendent from worldly interests means returning to the "essence of literature," how could we be so concerned with international awards?

	Art is transcendence, not detachment. What is meant by "returning to the essence of literature" should be a return from the non-human to the human, not a return from the human to the non-human. In other words, whether it is transcendence or return, it is a process of real life, not the "movement of literature itself" outside of humans. Therefore, historical, social, and realistic attributes, as human attributes, are also inherent attributes of the so-called "essence of literature." The more these attributes are enriched, the more the "essence of literature" is enriched. For this reason, we can use the same value standard to measure all literary works. This standard is how much impetus they provide for human progress. It is on the basis of this standard that we emphasize the enlightenment mission of contemporary literature.

	The counter-arguments are very clever and powerful. The value orientation of literature is multi-faceted, while social reality is relatively singular. The enlightenment tasks that are targeted at such a singular social background are even more singular. Therefore, it cannot become the task of literature. Especially in contemporary China, compared to the May Fourth period, the situation has changed greatly, and it is no longer possible to carry out a singular enlightenment of democracy and science, because at this time, even the value orientation of society has already become pluralistic. "'The May Fourth period was when China's feudal society had just ended, and a group of intellectuals, after coming into contact with a modern civilization model from the West, hoped to bring it to China. What is called 'science and democracy' actually belongs to the category of Western modern capitalist civilization. But while China was carrying out such a relatively simple enlightenment, the world had already changed, producing multiple values.' 'In contemporary times, multiple value systems from around the world are all influencing Chinese society, so we cannot use a single value like 'democracy and science' to enlighten the pluralistic reality.' This opinion is wrong mainly because it misunderstands China's history and reality.

	It is incorrect to say that feudal society had ended in the May Fourth period. Of course, it is also incorrect to say that China in the 1980s is still a feudal autocracy. The birth of New China, the collapse of the feudal political system and feudal land system, are undeniable great historical progress. However, we have not had the chance to carry out the anti-feudal struggle to the end in the field of ideology and culture. The "leftist line" that brought us such deep national disasters and plunged us into so many survival crises, as a modern version of feudal autocracy, still has an unignorable influence in China today. Whether it is translating old Confucianism into "new Confucianism," or transforming old authority into "new authority," or calling power concentration "democratic centralism" ("democratic centralism" is said to be democracy), or calling corruption the price of progress... in order to use the general to negate the individual, the whole to negate the individual, norms to limit dynamism, the sediment of past history to bury the dynamic factors of future development, and the worship of externally given common principles to suppress the power and possibility of each individual to create life and control their own destiny. In short, it is to use the ancient, pre-May Fourth, unified, pyramid-like structure of political and religious fusion to cast the soul of each person, obstruct the process of reform, and obstruct people's efforts to get out of the abyss of crisis. No matter how "pluralistic" the value orientation is, all "pluralism" is covered with a pale, illusory, and temporary color under this huge shadow. When "pure literature" theorists declare that feudalism ended in the May Fourth period and we have no possibility of carrying out a singular enlightenment of "democracy and science" like the May Fourth period, they should have noticed this most basic fact.

	Maybe they noticed it, maybe they didn't. In any case, this non-literary fact will eventually enter literature through controlling the fate of individual writers and influencing the thoughts and feelings of individual writers, forcing writers to make literary choices. No matter how "pluralistic" the choice is, the literature of the same era will all draw energy from the same center of the same era. Contemporary Chinese literature, like a flowering tree, its countless branches reaching towards the future, all draw nourishment from the same root—our disaster-stricken and crisis-ridden real life. The deeper the root is planted, the higher the branches will grow, and the more abundant the flowers and leaves will be. This is the proof of the tree's vitality. Without the soil of reality, any "pluralism" will lose its vitality and become a decoration of a monotonous, unified life, like artificial flowers or plastic flowers.

	True (not illusory) pluralism is rooted in the full development of human individuality and creativity. It can only be realized through human liberation. Human liberation has its historical and social prerequisites. In other words, its specific practice starts from specific living conditions. Without the reality of prerequisites and starting points, human liberation is an empty phrase, and pluralism is out of the question. Far from reality, hiding in an ivory tower to weave colorful dreams, while avoiding the fierce whiskers of feudal forces, thinking that this can achieve pluralism, isn't it "even more distant by ten thousand layers of clouds"?

	Therefore, the enlightenment mission of literature, this anti-feudal "singular" need, is the "singular" channel for Chinese literature to move towards pluralism.

	"Art for art's sake," "returning to the essence of literature," is not only a literary value, but also a "human" value. Its strongest argument is that only art for its own sake can maintain the writer's independent personality and creative freedom. But we ask, if this "self" is also not independent and not free, how can the art that expresses it both avoid struggle and gain independence and freedom for the "self"? Where is this "self"? Have you not seen that the gentlemen of the Creation Society, after guarding the sacred temple of art for a few years, not only overturned their own propositions but also became "revolutionary warriors" to suppress their own comrades? Even Lu Xun, who made us deeply respect him with his unyielding independent spirit, after coming into contact with Qu Qiubai, Feng Xuefeng, and others, seemed to lose his self-affirming value support point and confusingly praised "command literature." If this was due to their era, then later, for example, the various phenomena that Ba Jin deeply regretted in his *Random Thoughts*, and the various phenomena revealed in the article by Zhu Xueteng in the ninth issue of *Book Forest* last year, cannot but make us reflect on ourselves.

	Reflection is also a kind of enlightenment, a kind of "human" self-enlightenment. Enlightenment is a need of the times, and its forms and contents are diverse, pluralistic, and multi-layered. Just as the wounds of spiritual slavery under feudalism are diverse, pluralistic, and multi-layered. Therefore, enlightening literature will not be "singular" literature. What is called enlightenment is to awaken self-awareness and eliminate blindness. In contemporary China, as the "new authoritarianism" advocates, there is a universal ignorance and blindness. This is ignorance and blindness of different forms and layers. For example, illiteracy and aesthetic blindness; legal blindness and moral blindness are not the same thing. The lack of crisis consciousness and the lack of absurdity consciousness, the lack of democratic consciousness and life consciousness, are also not the same level of lack, and as for the "Nobel complex" in the literary world and the like, it is a kind of high-level blindness in the spiritual realm. But all these various forms of blindness have a common effect: they provide conditions for the existence of feudal autocracy.

	Blindness is darkness, blindness is a cage. The Enlightenment Movement, as a broad "literacy" movement, is itself a real process of human self-liberation, a process of advancing ourselves to transcend the present and move towards the future. It is different from, for example, democratic movements or top-down reforms. It is only a cultural movement, but if there is no such cultural movement to accompany it, any revolutionary practice will not succeed. In this sense, it can be said that the Enlightenment Movement is the most operational part of the cultural movement. Its content is extremely broad: from popular education to theoretical research, from issuing crisis alerts to implementing news reforms, from clarifying historical facts to objectively evaluating leaders, all constitute a fierce impact on feudalism.

	Literary enlightenment is different from general cultural enlightenment. For example, it is different from scientific enlightenment (popularizing knowledge), philosophical enlightenment (explaining the meaning of life and human value), political and ethical enlightenment (reconstructing behavioral norms), and historical research and news reporting enlightenment (revealing the truth). Literature, in its enlightening sense, mainly provides people with new angles to observe life through the path of renewing sensory modes, thereby expanding people's thinking space, raising people's spiritual realm, and activating people's previously dormant sympathy, sense of justice, creativity, that is, the ability of self-transcendence and promoting historical progress. The writer is not above the reader. When he ignites the sun of the poetic kingdom in the dark night, not only the reader's heart path is illuminated, but also his own dimly lit soul.

	Enlightenment of different levels illuminates the darkness of different levels. In the levels that other enlightenment lights cannot reach, for example, numbness to beauty and numbness to pain, lack of absurdity and loss, literary illumination may be able to reach its most hidden corners. And when those corners are illuminated, some other corners may also appear. Therefore, literary enlightenment is not independent of other enlightenment. Literary enlightenment and other enlightenment are mutually penetrating and complementary. This is because aesthetic value is not a singular value, for example, it is not a singular political value or economic value, nor is it a singular scientific value, moral value, or any other value. It is a subjective, active, sensory grasp of the comprehensive unity of multiple values by a person in action and progress. For this reason, enlightenment value must be contained in aesthetic value, the pursuit of beauty must be consistent with human liberation, and any great literary work must necessarily enhance the momentum of historical progress.

	Writers are not just masters of language who play with techniques, or experts who create interesting stories. They should first be humanistic intellectuals who strongly realize the historical mission bestowed by the times. Facing the powerful feudal forces that hinder our progress, we cannot refuse the enlightenment mission, using a fictional "essence of literature" to attract and consume the prime of many excellent authors, making them become non-productive expenditures of history. Fortunately, this ready-made path has never been able to standardize the mainstream of contemporary literary trends. The Chinese literary current, which has been accumulating since the May Fourth period, encompassing everything like a river's mud, to the point of not knowing whether it is solid or liquid, has been divided into many backflows under the blockade of the great wall of feudal autocracy, colliding with each other and yet penetrating each other, emitting a dull, metallic sound. It washes back and forth at the base of the great wall, while seeping moisture into every crack of the ancient bricks. Under the dull atmosphere, there is an unseen tension. In it, we can vaguely see the dawn of the new era that several generations have struggled for.

　　文学与启蒙
    高尔泰
    １９８６年底，《青年作家》发表了一小段我同北岛谈话的录音纪录，好在不长，抄录如下：
    高尔泰：所谓诗，无非是要用自己灵魂的力量，去震撼别人的灵魂。用自己激情的热度，去点燃别人的激情，凡能做到这一点的，就是优秀的诗人。
    北岛：但是作为一个诗人，总应该给艺术本身增添一点色彩，给诗的王国增加一分财富，把诗的历史向前推进一步，才谈得上优秀。
    高尔泰：任何王国都只能建立在现实生活的土地之上。任何历史，都只能是人类进步过程的一部分。诗的王国和诗的历史，也不例外。
    北岛：但是诗的追求不是实用主义的追求，诗的目的和诗的理想应当比现实生活中的目的和理想更高。
    高尔泰：但是，他们已经把理想和目的变成了诗。
    北岛：那不是异化了吗？
    高尔泰：你们可以骄傲你们接近太阳，他们也可以骄傲他们接近大地。
    北岛是先行者，他的诗是当今极盛一时的现代诗的第一声春雷。他关于诗的这些见解，也是目前广为流行的“纯文学”论的先声。由于追求美——那诗国的太阳，他们现在已经飞得很高了。
    但诗是人类精神的创造物，诗国的太阳只能在精神的宇宙里存在。古今中外许多诗国的王者，包括我们当代的北岛，在现实生活中都艰难困苦而且孤寂。“时穷反遭俗眼白，世上未有如公贫。”当然有时候，也有欢呼，也有鲜花，也有如雷的掌声。但这一切，丝毫也改变不了他们的命运。“才名塞天地，身世老风尘”的，岂止是李白一人。
    精神是人的东西，人的创造物和功能，人的存在方式和行动工具，它不断扬弃而又不断更新，积淀如文化史，生发如未来景观，从而赋予我们此时此地的人生以多元的和多层次的价值和意义。对于这样一种价值和意义，而不是某种单一的价值和意义的感性直观的“把握”，主观能动地参与性地而不是被动地“反映”性地“把握”，也就是创造，也就是审美，也就是使那诗国的太阳得以升起的杠杆。它离不开此时此地的人生这一支点。
    正如主宰物质宇宙的是能，主宰精神宇宙的是美，——那诗国的太阳。美之所以具有改造世界的现实力量，就因为它象征着我们所向往的、通过我们的努力有可能实现的我们的某种最佳存在方式，从而引导我们超越现在走向未来，并使得此时此地的人生显出了它的荒谬性。正因如此，我们把荒谬意识，以及与之相应的痛苦感、现实感和使命感等，都看作是活跃的审美意识。
    易言之，精神宇宙里的太阳，作为在过去与未来、在虚无与存在的交叉点上燃烧着的炬火，如果没有它所照耀的万事万物，如果没有它所照耀的此时此地的现实人生，就必将暗淡无光，失去存在的意义与根据。为什么“纯文学”的读者愈来愈少了，因为在一个如此风雷激荡而又波诡云谲的时代，它不能提供一盏小小的风灯，把人们脚下的荒径照亮，不能提供一个意义的世界，引导千百万人走出他们的迷茫。
    于是出现了一个人为的二律背反：作者们愈是追求“艺术”，离艺术也就愈是遥远。离人生的遥远也就是离艺术的遥远。离大地的遥远也就是离太阳的遥远。当前文艺界广为流行的所谓“诺贝尔情结”，“走向世界情结”，也就是这种遥远的最鲜明的标志。如果我们的植根于现实生活的心理动力强大到足以迫使我们不顾一切后果地要拿起笔来写作，我们怎么会有兴趣于辨别外来的褒贬呢？退一步说，如果愈是超越于世俗的功利就愈是能够回到“文学本体”，我们又怎么能如此在乎国际社会的奖励呢？
    艺术是超越，而不是超脱。所谓“回归文学本体”，应该是从非人的东西向人回归，而不是人向非人的东西回归。易言之，无论超越还是回归都是现实的人生过程，而不是人以外的“文学自身的运动”。所以历史性、社会性、现实性等等，作为人的属性，也都无不是所谓“文学本体”固有的属性。这些属性愈是充实，“文学本体”也就愈是充实。正因为如此，我们有可能用同一个价值尺度，来衡量所有的文学作品。这个尺度就是为人类的进步提供了多少动力。正是以这个尺度为前提，我们强调当代文学的启蒙任务。
    反对意见很精彩，也很有力。文学的价值取向是多元的，社会现实则比较单一，在单一的社会背景下提出的有针对性的启蒙任务就更单一了。因此它不可能成为文学的任务。特别是在当代中国，同“五四”时期相比，情况已经发生了很大的变化，不可能再像“五四”时期那样进行某种单一的民主与科学的思想启蒙，因为这时即使是社会的价值取向也已经是多元化的了。“‘五四’时期是中国封建社会刚刚结束、一批知识分子从西方接触到一种近代文明的模式，然后希望将之搬到中国来。所谓‘科学与民主’实际上是属于西方近代资本主义文明的范畴。但就在中国进行这种比较单纯的启蒙的同时，世界已经发生了变化，产生了多元的价值。”“当代世界多元的价值体系都在对中国社会产生着影响，我们就不能单拿‘民主与科学’这样一种单一的价值来对多元的现实进行启蒙。”这种意见之所以不对，主要是因为它误解了中国的历史和现实。
    说封建社会在“五四”时期已经结束是不对的。当然，说８０年代的中国仍然是封建专制主义也是不对的。新中国的诞生，封建政治制度和封建土地制度的瓦解，都是不可否认的巨大的历史进步。但是，我们确实没有来得及在思想文化领域把反对封建主义的斗争进行到底。给我们带来如此深重的民族灾难，使我们陷入如此众多的生存危机的“极左路线”，作为封建专制主义的现代翻版，至今还在中国有着不可忽视的影响。或者把老儒学翻译为“新儒学”，或者把老权威变通为“新权威”，或者把权势集中说成是“民主集中”（“民主集中”又被说成是民主），把腐败说成是进步的代价……以期用共性来否定个性，用整体来否定个体，用规范来限制动力，用过去历史的积淀物来埋葬未来发展的动力因，用对外在给定的共同原理原则的崇拜，来压抑各个个人创造生活和支配自己命运的力量和可能性。总之是要用那古老的、“五四”以前就一直存在的、政教合一的一元化塔式结构，来熔铸每一个人的灵魂，阻碍改革的进程，阻碍人们为走出危机的深谷而作的努力。不论价值取向如何“多元”，我们所面临的这个阻力和危机是共同的。在它巨大的阴影下任何“多元”都笼罩着一层惨淡虚幻的和暂时的色彩。当“纯文学”论者们宣称封建主义已经在“五四”时期结束，我们没有可能再像“五四”时期那样进行单一的“民主与科学”的思想启蒙时，他们本来是应当注意到这个最基本的事实的。
    也许注意到了，也许没有。无论如何，这个非文学的事实终将通过支配作家个人的命运和影响作家个人的思想感情进入文学，迫使作家们作出文学的选择。不论选择是如何的“多元”，同一时代的文学都将从同一时代的重心吸取能源。当代中国文学，就像一株开花的树，它无数伸向未来的、繁杂交叉的树枝，都无不从同一本根——我们灾难深重而又危机四伏的现实生活获得营养。这个根扎得越深，那些枝干也就长得越高，花和叶也就愈繁茂。这才是树木生命力的证明。离开了现实的大地，任何“多元”都将失去生命，而成为绢花、塑料花一类大一统单调生活的装饰品。
    真正的（不是虚幻的）多元化植根于人类个性和创造力的充分发挥，它只有通过人的解放来实现。而人的解放是有其历史的和社会的前提的。换言之，其具体实践是以特定的生存条件为出发点的。离开了现实的前提和出发点，人的解放只是一句空话，多元化更谈不上。远离现实，躲在象牙之塔里编织一些五光十色的梦幻，而又要避开封建势力雄赳赳的猫须，以为这样能够实现多元，岂不是“更隔蓬山一万重”了吗？
    所以文学的启蒙任务，这反封建的“单一”需要，是中国文学走向多元化的“单一”的通道。
    “为艺术而艺术”、“回到文学本体”，这不仅是一种文学的价值观，而且是一种“人的”价值观。其最有力的论据是，只有为自身的艺术才能够保持作家的独立人格和创造的自由。但是，我们要问，如果连这个“自身”也是不独立的和不自由的，作为其表现的艺术又如何能既回避抗争又使“自身”获得独立与自由呢？这个“自身”在哪里呢？君不见当年的创造社诸公，在神圣的艺术之宫里谨守了几年之后，不但自己推翻了自己的主张，而且纷纷都成了围剿自己同道的“革命战士”了。就连以其桀骜不驯的独立精神使我们十分敬爱的鲁迅先生，在与瞿秋白、冯雪峰等人接触之后，也仿佛失掉了自我肯定的价值支点，令人困惑地赞美起“遵命文学”来了。如果说那是他们的时代使然，那么后来，例如巴金先生在《随想录》中深感痛心的那种种现象，去年《书林》第九期朱学勤的文章所揭示的那种种现象，则不能不引起我们自身的反思了。
    反思也是一种启蒙，一种“人的”自我启蒙。启蒙是一种时代的需要，它的形式和内容也是多种多样的，多元的和多层次的。正如同封建主义精神奴役的创伤是多种多样，多元的和多层次的。所以启蒙的文学也不会是“单一”的文学。所谓启蒙，也就是启发自觉性，消除盲目性。在当代中国，正如“新权威主义”者所宣称的那样，存在着普遍的愚昧和盲目。这是不同形式、不同层次的愚昧和盲目。例如文盲和美盲；法盲和道义盲就都不是一回事。危机意识的缺乏和荒谬意识的缺乏，民主意识和生命意识的缺乏，也都不是同一层次上的缺乏，至于文学界的“诺贝尔情结”之类，更是一种在高层次精神领域存在的低层次盲目了。但所有这一切形形色色的盲目都有一个共同效应：为封建专制主义的存在提供了条件。
    盲目就是黑暗，盲目就是牢笼。启蒙运动，作为一种广义的“扫盲”运动，其本身就是人的自我解放的现实的过程，就是推动我们超越现在走向未来的我们自身的力量的行进。它不同于例如民主运动或者自上而下的改革之类的革命的实践。它仅仅是一种文化的运动，但如果没有这种文化的运动与之配合，任何革命的实践都不会取得成功。在这个意义上可以说，启蒙运动是文化运动中最具有操作性的部分。其内容极为广阔：从普及教育到理论研究，从发出危机警报到实行新闻改革，从澄清历史事实到客观评价领袖人物，都无不构成对于封建主义的猛烈冲击。
    文学的启蒙，不同于一般文化的启蒙。例如不同于科学的启蒙（普及知识）、哲学的启蒙（阐释生活的意义与人的价值），政治伦理观念的启蒙（行为规范的重新建构），和历史研究、新闻报道的启蒙（揭露事实真相）。文学，在其启蒙的意义上，主要是通过更新感受方式的途径，来提供人们以观察生活的新的角度，从而拓展人们的思维空间，提高人们的精神境界，激活人们原先沉睡着的同情心、正义感、创造力，即自我超越和推动历史进步的能力。作家并不高于读者，当他在暗夜中燃烧起那诗国的太阳时，被照亮的不仅有读者的心路，还有他自己的若明若暗的灵魂。
    不同层次的启蒙之光，照亮不同层次的暗夜。在其他方面的启蒙之光无法到达的层次，例如对美的麻木和对痛苦的麻木，荒谬感和失落感的缺乏等等，文学的烛照也许可以达到它最隐蔽的角落。而当那些角落被照明时，其他的一些角落也可能都呈现出来了。所以文学的启蒙并不独立于其他方面的启蒙，文学的启蒙与其他方面的启蒙是互相渗透、互为补充的。这是因为审美的价值并非单一的价值，例如它不是单一的政治价值或者经济价值，也不是单一的科学价值、道德价值或任何其它价值。它是行动着和前进中的人对多种价值综合统一的而又主观能动的感性把握。正因为如此，审美价值之中必然包含着启蒙价值，美的追求必然与人的解放相一致，任何伟大的文学作品，都必然增强历史进步的动力。
    文学家不仅仅只是玩弄技巧的语言大师，编造有趣故事的技术专家，他们首先应当是强烈地意识到时代赋予自己的历史使命的人文知识分子。面对着阻碍我们进步的强大的封建势力，更不能拒绝启蒙任务，用一个虚构的“文学本体”，来吸附和消耗无数优秀作者的青壮期精力，使之成为历史的非生产性开支。幸而这条现成的思路，始终没有规范出当代文艺思潮的主流。那从“五四”以来就开始积聚起来的、包罗万象如江河之浊，以致不知是固体还是液体的中国文学潮流，在封建专制主义大墙的堵截下分成了许许多多的回流，互相碰撞而又互相渗透，发出金属般钝重的音响。它来回冲刷着大墙的墙基，同时把水份渗透到每一块古砖的纹隙。沉闷的局面下有一种看不见的紧张。在其中，我们依稀可以看到，几代人为之而奋斗的新时代的曙光。
