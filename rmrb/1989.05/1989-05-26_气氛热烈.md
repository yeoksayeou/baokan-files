The atmosphere is heated as the first session of the Soviet Union's People's Congress opens today. The sky is clear and the sun is shining, flags are flying in the streets, and the temperature is rising. The political atmosphere is even hotter. Over the past few months, there have been continuous gatherings supporting reformers as people's representatives, calling for the first session of the People's Congress to advance reforms. Yeltsin, who has been elected as a people's representative, nuclear physicist Sakharov, and the editor-in-chief of Izvestia, Laptev, have all expressed their political views. Pravda criticized Laptev for supporting statements that insult the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a few days ago. Yesterday, Laptev refuted this in Izvestia, saying it was a frame-up.

There are 900 Soviet reporters registered to cover the first session of the People's Congress, and 600 foreign reporters. Only 150 of them are allowed into the venue.

    气氛热烈
    苏联人民期待了近一年的首届人民代表大会今天开幕。晴空红日照，街头彩旗飘，气温骤升。政治气氛更热，几个月来支持改革家当人民代表，要求首届人代会推进改革的集会不断，已选上人民代表的叶利钦、核物理学家萨哈罗夫和《消息报》总编辑拉普捷夫各述政见。《真理报》前天批评拉普捷夫发表支持侮辱苏共的言论，后者昨天在《消息报》反驳说，这是栽赃。
    登记报道首届人代会的苏联记者９００名，外国记者６００名，获准到会场的仅１５０名。
