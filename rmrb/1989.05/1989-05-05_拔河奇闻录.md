**Tug-of-War Across the River**

Every Dragon Boat Festival, the town of Tanggang in Taiwan, China, holds a tug-of-war event across the river.

During the tug-of-war, two teams of 15 people each stand on opposite banks of the Futan River, which is nearly 200 meters wide. A rope that is over 200 meters long, as thick as a wrist, and weighs over 400 kilograms is pulled by a small motorboat to the other side. The referee stands on a floating platform in the middle of the river. Once the competition begins, both sides pull and tug, often resulting in someone being pulled into the river. However, they all wear life jackets, and there are rescue boats on standby, so there is no need to worry about safety issues.

**Tug-of-War with Ten Thousand People**

The county of Linxian in Gansu, China, once held a tug-of-war competition that could be considered the world's largest.

The rope used in the competition was made of steel wire twisted together and wrapped with hemp rope, weighing several thousand kilograms. The competition rules stated that one side had to pull the rope over the midline by 100 meters to win. Due to the large number of participants, the competition was extremely intense, sometimes lasting half an hour. However, once one side's formation was disrupted, adding a few more people would not help, and the scene was truly "a rout like a collapsing mountain."

**Ear Tug-of-War**

Ear tug-of-war is popular in the Inuit villages of Alaska, USA. The method of competition is simple: a nylon rope is tied to the ears of the participants on both ends. After the referee gives the signal, the competition begins amidst the cheers of the spectators. Because the ear area is more delicate, and the rope is thin, you can see the participants' ears turning from red to purple, their facial expressions in extreme pain, until one side can no longer endure the "torture" and groans to the ground, signaling the end of the competition. Kind-hearted spectators will rush over to help the contestants rub their poor ears.

**Thick Rope Tug-of-War**

Every autumn in Okinawa, Japan, a super thick rope tug-of-war competition is held. The rope used is extraordinarily thick, 160 meters long, 1 meter in diameter, and weighs 32 tons. The thick rope is tied with many small ropes for people to hold. This activity is known as one of the unique sights of Okinawa and attracts tens of thousands of tourists from around the world each year.

**Finger Tug-of-War**

The citizens of the small town of Mittenwald in West Germany love finger tug-of-war competitions. The method is the same as usual tug-of-war, except the competition is between two people. The rope is tied to the middle finger of each athlete, and whoever can pull the center point of the rope over the designated line wins. Due to the intense competition, broken fingers sometimes occur.

　　拔河奇闻录
    隔岸拔河
    每到端午节，我国的台湾唐港镇都要举办隔岸拔河活动。
    拔河时，两队各１５人，分别站于宽近２００米的福唐溪两岸，一条长２００多米、手腕般粗、重４００多公斤的绳子，由小汽艇牵着一头送至彼岸。裁判员站在河中央的浮台上。比赛开始后，两边你拉我拽，常常有人被拉下河中。不过，他们都穿着救生衣，且有救生艇严阵以待，不必担心安全问题。
    　　　　万人拔河
    我国甘肃临潭县曾举办过一次堪称世界第一的万人拔河赛。
    比赛用的绳子用钢丝拧成，外面加麻绳缠绕，重达数千公斤。比赛规定一方要拉过中线１００米才算胜。由于人多，竞争极为激烈，有时要相持半个小时。不过，一旦一方阵脚乱了，再添个把人也无济于事了，那场景真可谓“兵败如山倒”。
    　　　　耳朵拔河
    耳朵拔河盛行于美国阿拉斯加地区的因纽村落。比赛方法很简单，一根尼龙丝绳的两头各系在参赛者的耳朵上，待裁判发令后，角逐便在观众的喊叫声中开始。由于耳朵部位皮肉较嫩，绳子又细，眼看着参赛者的耳朵由红变紫，其面部表情痛苦万状，直至一方忍受不了这种“折磨”而呻吟倒地，比赛宣告结束。善良的观众会一拥而上帮助选手们揉搓那可怜的耳朵。
    　　　　粗绳拔河
    在日本的冲绳，每年秋季都要举行超级粗绳拔河比赛。所用之绳异常粗大，长１６０米，直径１米，重３２吨，粗大的绳子上系满了小绳，供人们抓握。此活动被誉为冲绳奇景之一，每年都吸引世界各地成千上万的游客。
    　　　　手指拔河
    西德小镇密顿瓦尔特的市民们酷爱手指拔河比赛。其方法和通常的拔河一样，只不过比赛是在两个人之间进行。绳子各系在运动员的中指上，谁能把绳子的中心点拉过划定的界线，就算获胜。由于比赛激烈，断指的事时有发生。
