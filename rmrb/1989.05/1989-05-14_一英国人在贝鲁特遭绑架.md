A British man was kidnapped in Beirut.

A 85-year-old British retired air force pilot, Jack Maine, was kidnapped in his home in the western district of Beirut on May 12.

An organization calling itself the "Armed Struggle Combat Squad" claimed responsibility for the kidnapping a few hours after the British man went missing.

The organization stated in an Arabic statement, "We demand that the British government release our comrade who was arrested without evidence for allegedly being involved in the assassination of Raji Ali."

Raji Ali was a famous Palestinian cartoonist who was assassinated in London in August 1987. The British authorities have detained at least one person involved in the case.

The organization also stated that they are willing to release the kidnapped person immediately if the British government agrees to conduct an open trial for their detainee.

Maine is the 19th foreigner to disappear in Lebanon in recent years and whose whereabouts are unknown.

　　一英国人在贝鲁特遭绑架
    新华社贝鲁特５月１３日电  住在贝鲁特西区的英国８５岁的空军退休飞行员杰克·麦恩，１２日在他的家中被绑架。
    一个自称为“武装斗争战斗队”的组织在这位英国老人失踪数小时后宣布，它对绑架事件负责。
    该组织在一项阿文声明中说，“我们要求英国政府释放在没有证据的情况下，因涉嫌参入暗杀拉吉·阿里而逮捕的同志。”
    拉吉·阿里曾是一名著名的巴勒斯坦漫画家，１９８７年８月在伦敦遭暗杀。英国当局至少关押了一名与此事有牵连的人员。
    该组织还说，只要英国政府宣布对他们的人进行公开的法庭审判，他们将愿意立即释放被绑架者。
    麦恩是近年来第１９个在黎巴嫩失踪，而下落不明的外国人。
