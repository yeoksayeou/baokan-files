Title: The "Xiangquan" Makes People Drunk

The Tujia people have brewed excellent wine—“Xiangquan” and “Jiǔguǐ.” The production factories for these two wines are the Jishou Wine Factory in Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The factory director is Wang Xibing, a well-known figure among contemporary Tujia people.

Almost as soon as we set foot on Hunan’s land, we were greeted by the intoxicating aroma of “Xiangquan.” This wine is not packaged in ceramic or glass bottles but in purple clay pots, a dull yellow color. At first glance, they look like the old-fashioned vinegar bottles used in Beijing; the packaging for “Jiǔguǐ” is even more unique, resembling a small cloth bag with the wine inside, and a string tied around the bottle’s neck. “When the earthy reaches its extreme, it becomes foreign.” These two bottles look very rustic, and if they weren’t displayed alongside famous wines like Maotai and Wuliangye in grand hotels, people might think they were unearthed from some ancient Han tomb. “The product sells because of its packaging.” Just for this ancient, elegant, and popular packaging, it will surely attract great interest.

These two packages were designed by the famous painter Huang Yongyu.

Huang Yongyu is a Tujia person. The land of Xiangxi nurtured this outstanding contemporary Chinese painter; the painter also deeply cherishes his beautiful hometown, where “people wander in paintings.” In 1984, when he returned to Xiangxi with members of the Japanese film industry for “Three Smiles,” he agreed to design the packaging for “Xiangquan.” Since then, Huang Yongyu has had an inseparable bond with “Xiangquan.” As for “Jiǔguǐ,” from its name to its design, it was all created by Huang Yongyu.

What are the advantages of “Xiangquan”? Wine experts say it is “clear and transparent, with a rich aroma, a rich and smooth taste, a clean aftertaste, and a typical strong aroma style”; connoisseurs, on the other hand, focus on practicality, and as soon as they see “Xiangquan,” their faces light up with smiles. I am neither a wine expert nor a connoisseur, so I dare not make any judgments. However, during this trip to Xiangxi, wherever we went, we saw “Xiangquan” on the tables. Moreover, in the lively “cheers” sounds, no one got drunk, and no one complained of a headache after drinking. “Xiangquan” makes people excited but also very gentle; perhaps this is its characteristic and advantage, just like the mountains and rivers of Xiangxi, which are subtle and memorable. The great writer Shen Congwen is also from Xiangxi, and I always feel that drinking “Xiangquan” is a bit like reading Shen’s novels. If one could enjoy Shen’s novels, appreciate Huang Yongyu’s paintings, and drink “Xiangquan” while immersed in the beautiful scenery of Xiangxi, “fusing four beauties into one,” what a wonderful experience that would be!

The initial recognition of “Xiangquan” was actually a “blessing in disguise.” In October 1982, “Xiangquan” participated in the “Minority Products Exhibition and Sale” held at the Nationalities Culture Palace in Beijing. During the setup, a worker accidentally broke a bottle of “Xiangquan,” and immediately, the entire hall was filled with a fragrant aroma that was refreshing to the heart. The workers and reporters who came to cover the event could not help but give their thumbs up: “Xiangquan, Xiangquan, truly a well-deserved name!”

Today’s “Xiangquan” is no longer just loved by people in Hunan; it can be found in hotels and restaurants in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. It can also be found in Japan, the Philippines, Singapore, and Hong Kong. It has truly stepped out of Hunan and into the world.

The popularity of “Xiangquan” is due to both favorable timing and location, as well as the support of people. The history of brewing in the Tujia people is unknown, but their brewing techniques are highly skilled and widespread, with many ordinary farming families able to make wine. Some speculate that the history of brewing in China began with the minority ethnic groups on the northern and southern borders. The north is cold, and the south is humid, and people initially brewed wine to strengthen their resistance to nature, not for the enjoyment of officials and nobles. Therefore, the prosperity of wine culture is in the interior, but its initial spark came from the border regions. “Xiangquan” in brewing technology can be said to be the culmination of Tujia craftsmanship. It uses high-quality cloudy sorghum and glutinous rice from the local area, which is unique and unparalleled. Of course, the most important thing in making wine is the water. Why is Maotai produced in Guizhou, Wuliangye in Sichuan, and Fenjiu in Shanxi’s Xinghuacun? The key is the good water there. The water used for “Xiangquan” is the spring water surrounding the factory’s hillside, namely Longquan, Fengquan, and Shouquan. These three springs are the nectar of the world that can be encountered but not sought. No wonder the famous film director Xie Jin wrote after visiting the factory: “Longquan, Fengquan, and Shouquan brew Xiangquan; Tujia, Miao, and Han are one family.”

Huang Yongyu said at the Sixth National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in 1984: “I am an outsider when it comes to wine. Out of a hundred painters, ninety-nine drink wine, and the one who doesn’t drink wine is me. A person who doesn’t drink wine talking about the wonders of wine often doesn’t hit the mark, but because this wine is produced in my hometown, and wine connoisseurs have said that this wine is indeed good, combined with my designed wine bottle, I can’t help but muster my spirits to talk about it.”

Huang Yongyu expressed his willingness to be the “salesman” for “Xiangquan,” and in recent years, he has indeed done a lot of work.

The reason “Xiangquan” makes people drunk is simple: it is because so many people from Xiangxi, the Tujia people, love it, cherish it, and nurture it!

### “湘泉”使人醉

　　“湘泉”使人醉
    本报记者  吴昊
    土家族人酿出了好酒——“湘泉”与“酒鬼”。这两种酒的生产厂家是湘西土家族苗族自治州吉首酒厂。它的厂长叫王锡炳，是当代土家族的一个颇有名气的人。
    几乎是一踏上湖南的土地，我们就闻到了“湘泉”的醉人芳香。这种酒的包装不用瓷瓶，不用玻璃瓶，用的是紫砂瓶，土黄色，一眼看去，就像当年老北京们用的醋葫芦；“酒鬼”的包装更加别致，像是一个小小的麻布口袋，酒就装在麻袋里，酒瓶的脖子上还系着一根麻绳。“土到极时即是洋”。这两种酒瓶看来很土，如果不是和茅台、五粮液等名酒一齐摆在大宾馆的橱窗里，人们一定会以为这是从哪个汉墓中发掘出来的。“货卖一张皮”，就凭这古色古香、雅俗共赏的包装，也会引起人们的极大兴趣。
    这两种包装都是著名画家黄永玉同志设计的。
    黄永玉是土家族人。湘西大地养育了这位我国当代杰出的画家；画家也深深地眷恋着那“人在画中游”的美丽故乡。１９８４年，当他回到湘西，偕同日本《三笑》电影界人士来到酒厂时，答应为“湘泉”设计包装。从那时起，黄永玉即与“湘泉”结下了不解之缘。至于“酒鬼”，从它的名字到装璜，则都是出自黄永玉同志之手。
    “湘泉”究竟有多少好处？酒专家们说它“清亮透明、窖香浓郁、味浓甘冽、后味干净、浓香型风格典型”；饮君子们则重实际，只见他们见了“湘泉”，一个个的脸上绽出了笑容。本人既非酒专家又非饮君子，不敢妄评。不过这一次湘西行，所到之处，见到摆着酒的桌子上几乎都是“湘泉”。而且在热热闹闹的“干杯”声中，没有人喝醉，也没有喝了酒以后叫喊“头疼”。“湘泉”使人兴奋，但又非常柔和，这是不是就是它的特点和好处；就像湘西的山水那样，引胜发微，让人回味。大作家沈从文也是湘西人，我总觉得喝“湘泉”酒，有点像读沈老的小说。如果能一边回味沈老的小说，一边欣赏黄永玉的画，一边饮着“湘泉”，忘情于湘西的绮丽风光之中，“熔四美于一炉”，那该是什么样的享受呢！
    “湘泉”的最初被重视，竟是一次“因祸得福”的偶然机会。１９８２年１０月，“湘泉”参加在北京民族文化宫举办的“少数民族用品展销会”，在搬货布馆时，一位工作人员不小心，将一瓶“湘泉”打破，顿时，满馆飘香，沁人心脾，布馆的同志和前来采访的记者闻香赶来，人们不禁伸出拇指：“湘泉，湘泉，名不虚传！”
    如今的湘泉，已不完全是湖南人喜欢它，北京、天津、上海、广州、深圳的宾馆、酒家里都可以见到它，日本、菲律宾、新加坡、香港也可以见到它。它正儿八经地走出了湖南，走向了世界。
    “湘泉”的走俏，既得天时地利，又得人和。土家人的酿造史究竟始于何年何代，已无从可考，不过这里的酿酒技术是非常高超和普遍的，许多普通的农家都会制酒。有人推测，我国的酿酒史最先始于南北边陲的少数民族；北国多寒冷，南方多瘴气，人们酿酒之初，正是为了增强对大自然进行抗争的力量，绝不是为了给达官贵人和少爷小姐们享乐的。因此，酒文化的繁荣在内地，而它的初始引发之地则在边疆。“湘泉”在酿制工艺上，可谓集土家之大成。它用的原料是产自当地的优质云雾高粱和糯米，可谓得天独厚，别具一格。当然，造酒最讲究的是水，茅台为什么产在贵州、五粮液为什么产在四川，汾酒为什么产在山西杏花村，关键就是那里的水好。“湘泉”用的水，是围绕该厂山坡上的泉水，即龙泉、凤泉、寿泉，这三股泉水即是“湘泉”，可遇而不可求的人间甘露。难怪著名电影导演谢晋来厂参观后这样写道：“龙泉、凤泉、寿泉酿湘泉；土家、苗家、汉家是一家。”
    黄永玉在１９８４年召开的全国政协六届二次会议上说：“我于酒是个外行，画画的一百人中九十九个喝酒，剩下的那个不喝酒的就是我。一个不喝酒的人要来介绍酒的妙处往往说不到点子上，但因为这种酒是在我的故乡出产的，而且酒君子们尝过之后说这种酒的确不错，又加上我设计的酒瓶子，就不免要打起精神来好好说一说。”
    黄永玉表示愿意做“湘泉”的“推销员”，这几年也真的干了不少实事。
    “湘泉”使人醉。原因无他，就在于有这么多的湘西人，土家族人热爱它，倾心它、浇灌它！
