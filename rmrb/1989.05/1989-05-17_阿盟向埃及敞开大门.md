**Commentary**

The Arab League has officially invited Egypt to participate in the emergency summit scheduled for May 23 in Morocco. This marks the Arab League's reopening of its doors to Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak is expected to reunite with Arab leaders to discuss national affairs. This is a significant event in the history of the Arab League and a symbol of the Arab nation's move towards unity.

Egypt's membership in the Arab League was suspended in 1979 at the Baghdad Summit due to the signing of the Camp David Accords. Since then, the Arab nation has experienced a period of disunity and internal strife. Past events have shown that disunity only weakens the entire Arab nation. In reality, "Egypt cannot do without the Arab countries; the Arab countries cannot do without Egypt."

Now, a decade of serious disputes among the Arabs is finally coming to an end.

Since the end of 1987, when the Arab League held its summit in Amman, most Arab countries have restored formal diplomatic relations with Egypt. Egypt has also taken a proactive stance towards reconciliation, improving relations with various Arab countries. The Arab world is gradually emerging from its state of division. This wave of Arab reconciliation has overcome historical psychological barriers and shed past constraints, merging into a powerful current that drives the Middle East towards a more peaceful direction. In major Middle Eastern events such as facilitating the ceasefire between Iran and Iraq, supporting the uprising of Palestinians in occupied territories, organizing Arab regional economic organizations, achieving the strategic shift of the PLO, and the formal talks between the U.S. and Palestine, Egypt and Arab countries have acted in concert. This has led to a strong Arab peace offensive. It can be frankly said that Egypt's return to the Arab League is a historical necessity and a natural outcome.

Currently, regional conflicts around the world are continuing to cool down. The Middle East issue is also at a critical juncture. The realistic negotiating stance has been accepted by the majority of Arab countries. Chairman Arafat recently announced in Paris that the 1964 PLO charter is "outdated," once again demonstrating the PLO's serious stance on politically resolving Middle East disputes. Meanwhile, Israel has proposed holding "free elections" in the occupied territories. The United States, with a cautious "small steps" approach, seeks to find "points of contact" between the Palestinians and Israelis based on the election plan. Clearly, the PLO's peace strategy can only be more powerful, flexible, and effective with the support of the entire Arab nation. Egypt's return to the Arab camp at this critical moment not only strengthens unity but also adds more avenues and means to politically confront Israel.

The end of the division among Arab countries brings hope for the peaceful resolution of Middle East disputes. At the same time, it is also evident that the Arab nation needs to walk a long way to truly unite and release all the energy of unity. The fair resolution of various Middle Eastern issues ultimately relies on the united strength of the Arab nation.

### 阿盟向埃及敞开大门

　　阿盟向埃及敞开大门
    本报记者  林皎明
    埃及收到参加预定本月２３日在摩洛哥召开的阿拉伯紧急首脑会议的正式邀请，这标志着阿盟重新向埃及敞开大门。届时，穆巴拉克总统可望与阿拉伯各国元首重新团聚，共商民族大业。这是阿拉伯联盟史上的一件大事，是阿拉伯民族走向团结的象征。
    埃及的阿盟成员国资格由于签署戴维营协议在１９７９年３月巴格达会议上被中止，阿拉伯民族从此经历了团结涣散、力量内耗的分裂时期。以往的风风雨雨已经证明，分裂状态只能削弱整个阿拉伯民族的力量，事实上，“埃及离不开阿拉伯国家；阿拉伯国家离不开埃及”。
    现在，阿拉伯１０年严重纷争的一页终于要翻过去了。
    从１９８７年底阿盟安曼首脑会议以来，绝大多数阿拉伯国家先后与埃及恢复正式外交关系；埃及也采取和解的积极态度，改善与阿拉伯各国的关系。阿拉伯世界一步一步走出分裂状况的谷底。这股阿拉伯民族和解的春水，绕过历史形成的心理屏障，摆脱以往各自立场的羁绊，汇合成湍湍急流，推动中东局势向缓和方向发展。在促成两伊停火、声援被占领土巴勒斯坦人民起义、组织阿拉伯区域性经济组织、实现巴解组织战略转变和美巴正式谈判等中东重大事件中，埃及和阿拉伯国家协同行动已铸成事实，而且由此引出强大的阿拉伯和平攻势。可以坦率地说，埃及回归阿盟是顺应历史，水到渠成。
    目前，世界地区争端在继续降温。中东问题也处在关键时期。现实的谈判立场已经被绝大多数阿拉伯国家接受。阿拉法特主席前不久在巴黎宣布１９６４年巴解宪章“过时”，再次表明巴解组织坚持政治解决中东争端的严肃立场。而以色列提出在被占领土举行“自由选举”的方案。美国以“小步”的谨慎态度力求在选举方案基础上寻找阿以双方的“接触点”。显然，巴解组织的和谈战略只有得到整个阿拉伯民族的支持，才能更加有力、更加灵活和有效。埃及在这个关键时刻回归阿拉伯阵营，不仅加强团结的力量，也将增添与以色列政治较量的途径和手段。
    阿拉伯国家基本结束分裂状态，为中东争端和平解决带来希望。同时，人们也会看到，阿拉伯民族要真正拧成一股绳，释放出全部团结的能量，还有一段路要走。中东诸多问题的公正解决，最终依靠的是阿拉伯团结一致的力量。
