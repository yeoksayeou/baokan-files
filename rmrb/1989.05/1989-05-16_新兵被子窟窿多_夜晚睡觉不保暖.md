New recruits' quilts have many holes and are not warm at night. Last year, when I went to the front line, I heard soldiers complaining that the quality of their quilts was too poor. The new quilts issued when they enlisted had become full of holes after just one winter. The other day, I went to the platoon again and saw that the quilts of the new recruits from last year were already full of "windows." Some had more than ten holes, while others had at least seven or eight. Some soldiers were busy sewing the falling cotton fluff together with needle and thread. The soldiers complained that in winter, the cold wind is bone-chilling, and they shiver at night. Due to the poor quality of the quilts, they are difficult to fold neatly, making it hard to keep the quarters tidy and presentable.

Relevant departments should strictly control the quality of military personnel's living supplies to ensure the health of the people's sons and daughters in the military.

　　新兵被子窟窿多　夜晚睡觉不保暖
    去年我到基层，就听到战士们反映他们的被子质量太差，入伍时发的新棉被，一个冬天用下来，就已千疮百孔。前几天，我又下连队，看到去年入伍的新战士晾晒的被子已开满了“天窗”，窟窿多的有十几个，少的也有七八个，有的战士正在用针线密密麻麻地把一块块要掉的棉絮勉强连接起来。战士们反映，冬天，寒风袭来透骨凉，夜晚睡觉冻得发抖。由于被子质量差，不好折叠，内务很难做到整齐美观。
    有关部门应严格把住军人生活用品质量关，保证人民子弟兵的身体健康。
