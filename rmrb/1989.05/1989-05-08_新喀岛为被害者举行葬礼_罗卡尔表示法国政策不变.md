Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 8th.

New Caledonia held a funeral for the victims yesterday. French Prime Minister Michel Rocard, who attended the funeral in Noumea, the capital of New Caledonia, stated that France would not change its policy towards the island and hoped that the Matignon Accords signed last year would be implemented.

The Matignon Accords were signed in June last year by the two factions on the island under the auspices of the French government, outlining the island's system and future. On May 4, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the leader of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, and Yeiwene Yeiwene were shot and killed by extremists during a rally, raising concerns about the island's peaceful future. In response, Prime Minister Rocard rushed to Noumea on May 5.

Rocard met with leaders from various factions there. He said that a single murder should not interrupt the peace process.

	May 7th, crowds in the capital Noumea of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia attended the funeral for Jean-Marie Tjibaou, the leader of the New Caledonian independence movement and chairman of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, and the general secretary of the front, Yeiwene Yeiwene, who were assassinated on May 4th. French Prime Minister Michel Rocard also attended the funeral.

　　新喀岛为被害者举行葬礼    
    罗卡尔表示法国政策不变
    本报巴黎５月８日电  记者张启华报道：法国总理罗卡尔昨天在新喀里多尼亚首府努美阿参加被杀害独立派领导人葬礼时表示，法国不会改变它对该岛的政策，并希望去年达成的马提翁协议得到实行。
    马提翁协议是去年６月该岛两派在法国政府主持下签订的一项关于该岛体制和前途的协议。５月４日，卡纳克社会主义民族解放阵线领导人蒂巴奥和叶文纳在一次集会上被极端分子枪杀后，人们对新喀岛的和平前景曾表示忧虑。为此，５月５日罗卡尔总理赶赴努美阿。
    罗卡尔总理在那里会见了各方的领导人。他说，一次谋杀案件不能中断和平的进程。
