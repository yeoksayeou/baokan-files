State Councilor Li Tieying delivered a television speech today to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, expressing the Chinese government's hope that humanitarianism will be more widely respected around the world.

Li Tieying said that fulfilling humanitarian obligations in wartime is a consistent stance of the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese government under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. It is well known that during the War of Resistance Against Japan and later the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, provided the captured enemy personnel with due humanitarian treatment and care.

Li Tieying introduced that in 1952, the Chinese government formally recognized the four Geneva Conventions. In 1983, China joined two additional protocols to the Geneva Conventions. The Chinese government has consistently adhered to the provisions of the conventions and actively fulfilled the various obligations stipulated in the conventions. In recent years, the Chinese Red Cross Society has also, together with the International Red Cross, organized international humanitarian law training classes and seminars in China, disseminating international humanitarian law to relevant departments and all sectors of society, and exploring ways and means to better implement it in China. The Chinese government has always supported and will continue to support the Chinese Red Cross Society in its work of promoting humanitarianism and disseminating international humanitarian law. He said that currently, the world is showing a clear trend towards détente. However, local wars are still ongoing. The principles of humanitarianism are often violated. The Chinese government, people, and Red Cross Society sincerely hope that the governments of the relevant countries and the parties involved in armed conflicts will stop all actions that violate the international humanitarian conventions and principles as soon as possible. We are also willing to work more actively with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies of various countries and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to widely disseminate international humanitarian law and make greater efforts to promote the implementation of international humanitarian law.

In 1964, the Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field was signed by representatives of nine countries in Geneva, Switzerland, marking the birth of international humanitarian law and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. This convention was developed in 1949 into four conventions applicable to land warfare, naval warfare, prisoners of war, and civilians in war zones, and two additional protocols were added in 1977.

　　李铁映发表电视讲话
    纪念国际红十字红新月运动１２５周年
    新华社北京５月２７日电  国务委员李铁映今天为纪念国际红十字和红新月运动１２５周年发表电视讲话，表达中国政府希望人道主义能在全世界得到更广泛尊重的良好愿望。
    李铁映说，在战争状态下履行人道主义义务是中国共产党领导的人民军队和中国政府的一贯立场。众所周知，在抗日战争以及后来的抗美援朝战争中，中国共产党领导下的人民军队和中国人民都给予了对方被俘人员以应有的人道待遇和照料。
    李铁映介绍说，１９５２年我国政府正式承认了日内瓦四公约。１９８３年又加入了日内瓦公约的两个附加议定书。中国政府一贯遵守公约的规定，并积极地履行了公约规定的各项义务。近年来中国红十字会还与国际红十字组织一起在中国举办了国际人道主义法讲习班和研讨会，向有关部门和社会各界传播国际人道主义法，探讨使其在中国得到更好实施的办法和途径。中国政府一贯支持并将继续支持中国红十字会宣传人道主义、传播国际人道主义法的工作。他说，当前世界上出现了以缓和为主流的明显趋势。但是局部战争还在继续。人道主义的原则经常受到侵犯。中国政府、中国人民和中国红十字会衷心地希望有关国家的政府和武装冲突中有关方面尽快停止一切违反国际人道主义公约和原则的行动。我们还愿意同各国红十字会、红新月会和红十字国际组织一道更加积极地行动起来，广泛传播国际人道主义法，为促进国际人道主义法的实施做出更大的努力。
    １９６４年，关于改善作战部队伤病员待遇的公约由９个国家的代表在瑞士日内瓦签署，宣告了国际人道主义法和国际红十字与红新月运动的诞生。这一公约在１９４９年发展为分别适用于陆战、海战、战俘和战区平民的四个公约，１９７７年又增加了两个附加议定书。
