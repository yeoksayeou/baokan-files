    Clear Responsibilities at All Levels: Hebei Signs Price Control Target Responsibility Statements

    Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, April 29th - Reporter Chen Guoqing reports: Yesterday afternoon, Hebei Province Governor Yue Qifeng signed price control target responsibility statements with the main leaders of 18 cities and districts and 17 relevant departments under the provincial government.

    This year, Hebei's price situation has been severe. To ensure that the price increase this year is significantly lower than last year and to guarantee the normal supply of people's daily necessities, the Hebei Provincial Government has decided to designate 20 items, including grains, edible oils, pork, beef and mutton, staple vegetables, sugar, salt, detergent, soap, primary school exercise books, pure cotton white cloth, and urban living coal, as essential commodities. The government will do everything possible to develop production, stabilize prices, and ensure supply. To control prices, the provincial government has broken down the price control targets into vertical and horizontal components, assigning them to various cities and districts and relevant provincial government departments, and signing responsibility statements. The responsibility statements clearly and specifically stipulate the categories of essential commodities and price control targets for each city and district and relevant provincial government departments, with the main leaders signing to guarantee them.

    The targets on the responsibility statements are not only directive but also an important part of the performance evaluation for the signatories, increasing the pressure and responsibility on the cities and districts and relevant provincial government departments. They will sign responsibility statements with their subordinates and relevant units, with each level taking responsibility, and ensuring that the price stabilization targets are truly implemented.

　　目标双向分解　责任层层明确    
    河北签订物价控制目标责任状
    本报石家庄４月２９日电  记者陈国琦报道：河北省省长岳岐峰昨天下午和全省１８个地市及省直１７个有关厅局的主要负责人，签订了物价控制目标责任状。
    今年以来，河北物价形势严峻。为确保今年物价涨幅明显低于去年，保障人民生活必需品的正常供应，河北省政府决定把粮食、食油、猪肉、牛羊肉、大路菜、食糖、食盐、洗衣粉、肥皂、小学生作业本、纯棉白布、城市生活用煤等２０种人民生活必需品作为必保商品，千方百计发展生产，稳定价格，保障供应。为平抑物价，省政府把物价控制目标进行双向分解，纵向分解到各地市，横向分解到省政府各有关部门，并签订了责任状。责任状对各地市和省直有关部门必保的商品类别及价格控制目标作了明确而具体的规定，由主要负责人在上面签字保证。
    责任状上的目标不仅带有指令性，而且也是考核签状者工作的一项重要内容，加强了地市和省直有关部门的压力和责任。他们将与下级及有关单位层层签订责任状，一级抓一级，层层动真的，切实把稳定物价的目标真正落到实处。
