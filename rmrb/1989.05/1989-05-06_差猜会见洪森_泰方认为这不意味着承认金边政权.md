Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, May 6th.

Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan today met with the Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh regime, Hun Sen, and exchanged views on the Cambodian issue.

Chatchai told reporters after the meeting that Hun Sen's visit to Thailand was unofficial, and his meeting with Hun Sen was also unofficial. Such a meeting does not mean recognition of the Phnom Penh regime.

Chatchai said that the prospects for peace in Cambodia have increased. Chatchai pointed out that there are still some differences among the various Cambodian factions, but he believes that Cambodian national reconciliation can be achieved. He said, "If the Cambodian factions do not come together, who else can help solve the Cambodian problem?"

Regarding the Khmer Rouge, Chatchai said that the Khmer Rouge is one of the three factions of the CGDK, and it should of course be included in the proposed four-party coalition government.

Chatchai expressed that after Vietnam withdraws its troops from Cambodia and Cambodia achieves peace, no country will provide military assistance to let the Cambodian people fight again. Chatchai also expressed that if invited, Thailand can participate in the proposed international supervisory committee.

　　差猜会见洪森    
    泰方认为这不意味着承认金边政权
    新华社曼谷５月６日电  泰国总理差猜·春哈旺今天在这里会见了金边政权总理洪森，就柬埔寨问题交换了意见。
    差猜在会见后对记者说，洪森来泰是非正式的，他同洪森的会见也是非正式的。这种会见不意味着承认金边政权。
    差猜说，目前，柬埔寨实现和平的希望增大了。差猜指出，柬埔寨各派还存在一些分歧，但他相信柬埔寨民族和解是可以实现的。他说，柬埔寨各派如不相互靠拢，那还有谁可以帮助解决柬埔寨问题呢？
    在谈到红色高棉时，差猜说，红色高棉是民柬３方中的一派，它当然应被包括在４方联合政府中。
    差猜表示，越南从柬埔寨撤军、柬埔寨实现和平后，没有哪一个国家会再提供军事援助，让柬埔寨人重新开战。差猜还表示，如果得到邀请，泰国可以参加拟议中的国际监督委员会。
