	Why Has the Primary School Teacher Corps Become a "Matriarchy"?
	Liu Zhijun
	Xiahuayuan Coal Mine Primary School, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province

	If one pays a little attention, one will notice that the primary school teacher corps has become a "matriarchy," with male teachers being as rare as phoenix feathers. In a few primary schools in our district, male teachers on the front line account for 15.3%, 5.1%, and 2.7% respectively. Why has this situation arisen? The root cause lies in the fact that teaching is a tough job, and primary school male teachers are even tougher.

	According to a survey by relevant departments, among the 12 industries in our country, teachers' income ranks second from the bottom, and primary school teachers rank last among teachers. At present, in most regions of our country, men still bear the main economic burden of the family, and the amount of income to a large extent determines the harmony and happiness of the family. There are many cases where male primary school teachers encounter difficulties or tragedies in marriage and other matters. I am a male primary school teacher, 20 years old, with a total monthly income of only 100 yuan, which is equivalent to the monthly bonus of my classmates who graduated with the same qualification and work in other professions. Even if I save and do not support my parents, how many yuan can I accumulate in a year? If I get married according to the current low standard (assuming someone is willing to marry this primary school teacher), buy a house, and furnish the home, by the time I have saved enough money, I will be nearly fifty.

	Chinese people have the habit of valuing the big and despising the small. Everyone has to go to primary school, but most people despise it. Once, a primary school teacher went to visit a student's home, and the student's parents were playing cards with someone. They just raised their eyelids and hummed, "The teacher is here," without moving their buttocks, continuing to play as if nothing had happened. The embarrassment of the "small" person at this moment can be imagined.

	In matters of lifelong significance, most female teachers frankly state: "I am already unlucky enough, and if I find another teacher?" Many young male teachers are most afraid of being called "teacher" by students on the street, feeling ashamed.

	Of the 22 male students in our 1987 graduating class of normal school students, four have changed their careers in just one and a half years.

	Do not blame us teachers for having a low level of thought and being obsessed with money. We teachers all feel that the state has cultivated us with great difficulty and are more concerned about the future of the country and the destiny of the nation. However, teachers are after all people who cannot be separated from actual life!

	We know that primary school is the foundation, and male teachers and female teachers cultivate students with different qualities. Without male teachers, it is a great loss for the school and the students. If the current state of education in our country cannot be fundamentally improved, male teachers in primary schools will become fewer and fewer.

　　小学教师队伍何以成了“女儿国”？
    河北省张家口市下花园煤矿小学  刘志俊
    只要大家稍稍留心，就会发现小学教师队伍已成了“女儿国”，男教师可谓凤毛麟角。就我区几所小学来看，第一线男教师分别占１５．３％、５．１％、２．７％。为什么会出现这样的情况？究其根源，在于教师苦，小学男教师更苦。
    据有关部门调查，在我国１２个行业中，教师的收入居倒数第二，而小学教师又居教师行业的倒数第一。目前我国的大部分地区，仍是男子承担家庭的主要经济负担，收入的多少在很大程度上决定着家庭的美满和谐与否。小学男教师在婚姻等问题上产生窘况或悲剧的不乏其例。我就是小学男教师，２０岁，月全部收入仅百元，这与同届同等学历而干其他专业的同学的每月奖金数相当。即使省吃俭用，不孝顺老人，一年又能积累几张人民币？按现在的低标准成家（假如有人肯下嫁我这位小学教师的话），买房子，置家具，等钱攒够了，也年近半百了。
    中国人有好大鄙小的习惯。人人都得上小学，但大都又鄙视它。有个小学教师去家访，学生家长正与人玩牌，只眼皮一撩，哼出一声“老师来啦”，屁股动也未动，若无其事地继续玩。此时“小”人物的窘境可想而知了。
    在终身大事上，多数女教师直言不讳地表态：“我就够倒霉了，再找个老师？”好多年轻男教师最怕大街上有学生喊老师，觉得丢人。
    我们１９８７届毕业生的一班师范生，男生共２２名，时隔仅一年半，就有４名改了行。
    不要一味指责我们的老师思想水平低，钻到钱眼儿里去了。我们当老师的都觉得国家培养我们不容易，更关心国家的前途，民族的命运。然而，当老师的毕竟也是脱离不开实际生活的人啊！
    我们知道，小学是基础，男教师与女教师培养出的学生气质不同。没有男教师，对学校和学生都是很大的损失。假如我国的教育现状不能彻底改观，小学里的男教师还会越来越少。
