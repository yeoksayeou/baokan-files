The Republic of Serbia in Yugoslavia has decided to issue commercial bonds to develop the Serbian economy. The total amount is $10 billion and 200 billion dinars (currently approximately 12,000 dinars equal $1). All Yugoslav residents, Yugoslav workers temporarily employed abroad, and foreign citizens with relatives in Yugoslavia can subscribe to these bonds. Subscribers will receive reasonable interest and enjoy tax exemptions and other preferential treatments.

The Economic Reform Committee of the Serbian Republic's Presidency pointed out that the funds raised from issuing the bonds will be used to revitalize the economy, especially for economic development projects that can generate high profits, including large and small joint investments and integrated projects. This will create conditions to increase new job opportunities, reform the economic structure, and strengthen economic ties with the most developed countries in Europe and the world. The committee also emphasized that this issuance of bonds must not repeat past practices, such as pressuring residents, especially those in difficult material conditions and general poverty, to subscribe to the bonds. This is not allowed.

　　南塞尔维亚共和国决定
    发放巨额商业债券
    本报贝尔格莱德５月１９日电  记者严正报道：南斯拉夫塞尔维亚共和国主席团经济改革委员会今晚正式决定发放发展塞尔维亚经济的商业债券，总额为１０亿美元和２万亿第纳尔（目前约１．２万第纳尔合１美元），所有南斯拉夫居民，临时在国外就业的南斯拉夫工人以及在南斯拉夫有亲属关系的外国公民都可以认购。认购者可以得到合理的利息，并享受减免税收和其它优惠条件。
    主席团经济改革委员会指出，发放债券筹集的资金将用来振兴经济，特别要用于能创造高利润的经济发展项目，包括大型的小型的共同投资和一体化的项目，以此创造条件增加新的就业点、改革经济结构、加强与欧洲和世界各最发达国家的经济联系。委员会还特别强调这次发放债券不能重复过去的做法，即对居民施加压力，威胁那些物质状况困难、处于一般贫困条件中的居民认购债券，这是不允许的。
