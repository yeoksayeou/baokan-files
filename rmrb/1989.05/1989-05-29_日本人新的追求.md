Japan, which once fervently believed in the power of money, has now come to realize: money is not everything. Money is not the be-all and end-all.

Since the end of the Second World War, the Japanese have maintained a low standard of living, dedicating themselves to hard work and contributing to their companies. This dedication has led to Japan's remarkable economic growth. Today, Japan flaunts its economic prowess, adorned with a glittering crown of wealth, to the world.

In recent years, the Japanese have seen their savings increase, but their quality of life remains lower than that of many developed countries. A Japanese bank employee complains, “Everyone notices that our salaries are among the highest in the world, but no one notices that we still live in cramped, rabbit-hutch-like rooms, constantly worried about the rising prices of staple goods like rice and meat. Moreover, to ensure job stability, we can hardly take a week off.”

A recent government survey further illustrates the plight of the Japanese. The results show that although the average income of Japanese citizens is among the highest in the world, 80% of them do not feel financially secure. High salaries come with heavy taxes, long working hours, poor living conditions, and exorbitant prices.

The first to demand a change in this situation are the young people. Born in the era of Japan's rapid economic growth, they have enjoyed material abundance and have not experienced the hardships endured by their predecessors. They are clearly influenced by hedonism and seek to escape the materialistic trap. This new value system is gradually coalescing into a wave of ideological reform. A salesman from Nissan Motor Company sighs, “Only now are the Japanese beginning to learn how to live. In the past, people were like machines in the material cycle; now, everyone is striving to be human.”

Faced with this wave of reform, the Japanese government and business community can no longer ignore it. The debates on this issue have become increasingly intense, and various measures to adapt to the changes are being implemented. For a time, the pursuit of a better life has become a hot topic.

The Ministry of Labor calls for more leisure time for workers! They propose that if Japanese working hours are reduced, people will have more time to spend money, which will also help stimulate economic growth. Therefore, they advocate for a reduction in working hours. This proposal has been taken seriously, and the government has implemented a new schedule starting from January this year, with two Saturdays off per month, breaking the traditional six-day workweek. The stock exchange and banks have followed suit, deciding to implement a five-day workweek. Many large companies have also followed this example.

Paradoxically, although some large companies have increased annual leave to 20 days, many people are still anxious, fearing that if they actually take more than five days of leave, their chances of promotion may be lost.

At the same time, the Japanese are cautiously working to eliminate the threat of high prices. For a long time, the Japanese have been their own worst enemies. If they buy a $1 item abroad, they only need to pay 130 yen at the normal exchange rate, but in Japan, they have to pay 200 yen. Many people are indignant about this. Economists, with evasive language, point to artificial “import barriers” and cumbersome distribution channels. The relevant departments have sincerely expressed their desire to change this situation to the people, but at the same time, they remind everyone to be patient, as no one can find a way to make the reforms effective in the short term.

Although reducing working hours and trying to lower prices are complex tasks, the Japanese are relieved to feel the breath of spring. However, housing reform is progressing slowly. So far, young people still find it as unrealistic as a fairy tale to buy an affordable house in Tokyo. Even government-subsidized housing, more than an hour away from the city center, requires 60 million yen to secure 100 square meters of living space.

The chief economist of Sumitomo Bank, Matsushita, emphasizes, “Improving the living standards of the people is of great significance to Japan, which has already established itself as an economic powerhouse on the international stage. If we want to give foreigners the impression that we are becoming a society that is balanced in economics, society, academia, and culture, then these ordinary life problems involving millions of people are not ordinary. Perhaps, after we change our lives, people will indisputably praise: Japan is not just an economic animal, but a leader of the world trend.”

### 日本人新的追求

　　日本人新的追求
    曾经笃信金钱的日本，时下终于发出感叹：金钱并非万能，金钱不是一切。
    自第二次世界大战以来，日本人一直保持低生活水平，他们崇高的追求是勤奋工作和为企业作贡献，这带来了日本的飞跃。目前，它正以经济“暴发户”的闪烁金冠，向全世界炫耀。
    近几年，日本人的存款大增，但是，生活质量与许多发达国家比却偏低。一位日本银行雇员抱怨：“谁都注意到我们的工资在世界上名列前茅，可谁也没有注意到我们仍住在兔窝般的陋室里，终日为米粮、肉食等商品中不断刮起的涨价风‘愁眉苦脸’，而且，要想保证职业比较稳定，休想请一星期以上的假。”
    最近，日本政府作的一项调查进一步表明了日本人的处境。调查结果显示：虽然日本国民平均收入属世界最富水平，但８０％的日本人并不认为自己手头宽裕。伴随高薪的是繁重的苛捐杂税、漫长的劳动时间、欠佳的居住条件以及令人头痛的高物价。
    要求摆脱这种局面的，首先是年轻人，他们诞生在日本经济急速起飞的时代，物质相当充裕，没有经历过前辈人咬紧牙关忍受的那种艰苦。他们明显受享乐主义影响，要求从物质的墓穴中站出来，这种全新的价值观日渐汇聚成观念改革的大潮。日产汽车公司的一位推销员感叹地说：“日本人直到今天才刚刚开始学习生活。过去，人在物质的大循环中，是机器；眼下，大家纷纷争做人。”
    面对这股改革大潮，日本政府和工商业再也不能熟视无睹了。就此进行的争论日益激烈，各种适应改革的措施纷纷出台，一时间对生活的追求热火朝天。
    劳工部呼吁全国：给予劳动者更多的消闲时间！他们提出理论，推测一旦日本人的工作时间减少，便会有更多的时间花钱，而这也有助于经济增长。因此，他们倡议削减工时。这项倡议得到了重视，政府从今年１月开始实行每月两个星期六不办公的新作息时间，打破了传统的每周六天工作制。证券交易所和银行紧步后尘，决定实行五日工作制。不少大企业也纷纷效仿。
    令人困惑不解的是，虽然一些大公司新增了２０天年假，仍有许多人惴惴不安地推测，如果他们真的按照新规，“实践”超过５天的年假，他们的擢升机会可能因此丧失。
    同时，日本人还在小心翼翼地消除高物价的威胁。长期以来，日本人总与自己过不去，如果在国外购买１美元的物品，日本人只需按正常比价付１３０日元，但在国内得花２００日元。不少人对此愤愤不平。经济学家言辞闪烁，矛头直指人为的“进口壁垒”和繁琐的批发渠道。有关部门向人民诚恳地表示了改变这种状况的愿望，但同时又不忘提醒人们：要耐心等待，没有人能想出办法使改革在短期内奏效。
    虽然缩短工时和设法调低物价的工作千头万绪，但令日本人欣慰的是，他们终于感觉到了春天的气息。然而住房的改革却步履维艰。迄今为止，年轻人仍觉得在东京购一间平价房如天方夜谭，即便由政府津贴修建的房屋，离市中心超过一小时路程，欲获得１００平方米的居住面积，也必须有６０００万日元作酬。
    三和银行首席经济学家松下茂强调说：“改善人民的居住水平，对现已在国际上占有经济强国地位的日本是举足轻重的事。如果我们希望给外国一个印象，让其感觉到我们正在成为一个经济、社会、学术与文化各方面都平衡的社会，那么，这些牵涉千万人的普通生活问题并不普通，也许，在我们改变生活之后，世人会不可置辩地称赞：日本不是经济动物，而是当之无愧的世界潮流的领导。”
