Favorable Climate, Good Growth: Northern Winter Wheat Region Expected to Have a Bountiful Harvest

Agricultural meteorology experts from the National Meteorological Science Research Institute told reporters today that since the beginning of spring, the northern winter wheat region in China has had abundant sunlight and appropriate rainfall. Currently, the growth of wheat in most areas is better than last year. If there are no significant adverse weather conditions in the later stages, this year's wheat harvest is expected to be bountiful.

Experts say that since the beginning of spring, the average temperature in the northern winter wheat region has been consistently higher than usual. With abundant light and heat, the wheat has returned to green earlier than in normal years. Due to the favorable climate during the wheat's overwintering period, the wheat seedlings have grown well in various places. In early March, when the wheat seedlings returned to green, the northern winter wheat region experienced widespread rainfall, which was equivalent to irrigating the seedlings with water for returning green. In mid-to-late April, the wheat region received spring rain again, which coincided with the wheat's jointing and booting stages, a critical period for water demand. These two timely rains have been very beneficial for the growth and development of wheat.

Experts also pointed out that since late April, there has been virtually no rainfall in the northern winter wheat region, and the temperature has remained higher than usual. The humidity in the wheat fields in northern Henan and parts of Shandong has decreased, and the water supply is insufficient, affecting the later growth of wheat. At the same time, parts of Shandong and Henan have experienced relatively severe pest and disease outbreaks.

Experts believe that overall, the current agricultural meteorological conditions in the northern winter wheat region are more favorable than unfavorable, and the wheat growth is good in most areas. Currently, efforts should be focused on the later-stage water and fertilizer management and pest and disease control for wheat, and measures should be taken to prevent the harm caused by dry hot winds.

　　气候适宜　长势良好    
    北方冬麦区丰收有望
    新华社北京５月７日电  （记者赵鹏）国家气象科学研究院农业气象专家今天对记者说，入春以来，我国北方冬麦区光照充足，降水适宜，目前大部分地区小麦长势好于去年，若后期无明显灾害天气，今年小麦可望丰收。
    专家称，入春后北方冬麦区平均气温持续偏高。光热充足，小麦较常年提早返青。由于小麦越冬期气候适宜，各地麦苗生长良好。３月上旬，正值麦苗返青，北方冬麦区出现大范围降水，等于给麦苗普浇了一次返青水。４月中下旬之交，麦区再降春雨，此时正值小麦拔节、孕穗期，是小麦需水关键阶段。这两次及时的降水对小麦生长发育十分有利。
    专家也指出，自４月下旬以来，北方冬麦区基本无降水，气温持续偏高，河南北部和山东部分地区麦田湿度下降，供水不足，影响了小麦后期生长。同时，山东、河南部分地区出现较严重的病虫害。
    专家认为，总的看来，目前北方冬麦区农业气象条件利大于弊，大部分地区小麦长势良好。当前应抓紧小麦后期水、肥管理及病虫害防治工作，预防干热风的危害。
