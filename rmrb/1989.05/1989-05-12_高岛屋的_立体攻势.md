Takashimaya, located in the prime real estate of Nihonbashi, Tokyo, is a historic department store. Starting from the 11th, a whirlwind of Chinese culture swept through. To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the "Great China Exhibition"; to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Beijing and Tokyo becoming sister cities, the "Beijing Historical and Cultural Exhibition"; and to celebrate the 40th anniversary of Beijing Radio's broadcasts to Japan, radio broadcasters from Beijing met with their Japanese audience. All these events took place on the 8th floor exhibition hall of Takashimaya Department Store, attracting a large number of Japanese customers.

Strolling through, it felt like walking through a long corridor of Chinese culture. Over there, the Chinese Folk Music Ensemble from Beijing was performing "Flower Moon Round." Over here, the Yunnan Province Minority Folk Dance Troupe's peacock dance was mesmerizing. Some people were comparing the similarities and differences between ancient Tang tri-colored glazed pottery and modern Tang tri-colored glazed pottery. Others were gathered around a model of the Yuan Dynasty's Dadu, pointing and discussing the unique features of old Beijing. Shanghai's "Hainan Style" fashion, on-site weaving of Zhuang brocade, a 10-year-old Yao boy and a 9-year-old Dai girl performing ink and watercolor paintings, Kang Youwei's calligraphy from the Qing Dynasty, all of which made people linger and reluctant to leave.

A reporter asked a customer carrying large and small bags for their thoughts. The response was: three-dimensional offensive. At first, it was hard to understand the meaning, but upon reflection, it made sense. The purpose of a department store is to sell goods. Within a limited time and space, it broadens people's horizons, helps them understand a foreign country, and places customers in a pleasant cultural atmosphere. How many people will leave empty-handed from a treasure trove?

　　高岛屋的“立体攻势”
    本报记者  于青
    本报东京５月１２日电　高岛屋，位于东京寸金之地的日本桥，是家历史悠久的百货店。从１１日开始，刮起一阵中国文化旋风。为庆祝中华人民共和国成立４０周年的“大中国展”；为庆祝北京和东京结为友好城市１０周年的“北京历史文化展”；为庆祝北京电台对日播音４０周年而来日本与听众见面的播音员，在高岛屋百货店第８层展厅济济一堂，吸引了众多的日本顾客。
    徜徉其间，好像是在中国文化长廊中漫步。这边，来自北京的中国歌舞团民族乐队正在演奏《花好月圆》。那边，云南省少数民族歌舞团的孔雀舞令人如醉如痴。一些人在品评古代唐三彩与现代唐三彩的异同。另一些人围着元代大都模型指指点点，追寻着旧北京的独特风貌。上海的“海南风情”时装，现场编织的壮锦，１０岁的瑶族男孩和９岁的傣族女孩在表演水墨画和水彩画，清代康有为的墨宝，无不让人流连忘返。
    记者问一位提着大包小包的顾客有何感想。答曰：立体攻势。乍听不解其意，细想不无道理。百货店的宗旨是销售商品。在有限的时间和空间内，使人们开阔眼界，了解异国，让顾客置身在赏心悦目的文化气氛中，有几人会宝山空回呢？
