The heroic melody of the times
—My View on "The Republic Will Not Forget"
Huang Shixian

The film "The Republic Will Not Forget," which takes the construction of a large steel base in the new era as its theme, brings a gust of steel wind to the waning screen. Amidst the cacophony of value-less, ideologically muddled, and culturally declining "entertainment films," it stands out even more.

"The Republic" (abbreviated) strikes a resonant artistic rhythm, delving into the souls of those builders who stand firmly on Chinese soil and radiate with the mission of promoting national rejuvenation through reform and opening up. It fearlessly and unashamedly sings the praises of the heroes who rebuilt the republic's steel edifice from the ruins of the Cultural Revolution, revealing their spirit of shared hardship with the republic and their noble dedication in the labor of modernization. I believe this is a sublime beauty that has been overlooked on the screen for too long. It revives the heroic melody of our times and seizes the initiative!

The creation of "The Republic" strives to break free from the old mold of reform-themed works, such as mechanically depicting the process or disputes over reform plans, or portraying reformers with a certain "iron-fisted" characteristic (without forgetting to add seasoning like the loss or disappointment of love). Although this film has not yet completely broken free from these stereotypical patterns (perhaps, during our historical transformation period of reforming old systems, life itself has some patterns), its pioneering spirit and the remarkable artistic achievements it has made are indeed commendable.

Although China's reform was forced by the times—some Western developed countries have already entered the industrial or post-industrial era, while China, which once considered itself the center of the world revolution, is still struggling to transition from an agrarian civilization to an industrial civilization (initially content with the spiritual delirium of "nightingale arrogance"), without reform, our nation would face the risk of being expelled from the "earthly realm"; without reform, there is no path to survival. The bell of reform thus rang out, resounding through the clouds!

As the "big boss" (general manager) of Hua Steel, Deng Gong undoubtedly came from the old industrial track of the "leftist" political model (he was not always correct or a "savior" sent from heaven), but he was an early awakener of the "spring river warming," a pioneer who bravely forged ahead when the reform bell rang. He was both a reformer who dared to take on challenges and storms, taking the lead in signing a military order with the central government to implement enterprise contracting at a large steel base, and later using the entire steel company's fixed assets as collateral to borrow from an international banking consortium, carrying out the bold "debt operation"; at the same time, he was not lacking in the flesh and blood of a living person and the complexity of the spirit, even being criticized by his own daughter as a strange old man who combines the new and the old, enthusiasm and cruelty, dedication and selfishness. In Hua Steel, he is a "competent boss," but in his family and various interpersonal relationships, he is an ordinary person with various emotional and behavioral shortcomings and "debt-ridden."

People see that Deng Gong's character and spiritual outlook clearly present a painful split. By the end of the film, Deng Gong retires, walking alone in front of the background of the fiery red iron water cascading down like a waterfall in the steel city, and delivers a monologue from the bottom of his heart but containing a certain historical tragedy: "... Thinking carefully, what have I left for people?—I left behind a debt of three billion five hundred million, I left behind a promise to move more than four thousand households of workers into new homes... I also owe countless comradeship, marital love, and father-daughter love. Look, in the end, I am the one who is debt-ridden!" This profound self-reflection makes one feel as if one can touch the pulsating soul of his lifelong dedication and unyielding spirit! Perhaps, the "unfinished state" bestowed by history is precisely what makes Deng Gong, this reformer figure, so charming.

Regarding the depiction of Deng Gong's character, there are several quite stern and sparkling artistic brushstrokes of the reform era. For example, on the issue of debt operation, the chief economist Zhong Tianwen disagreed with him and refused to sign the loan agreement with the international banking consortium. These two old comrades-in-arms, who have been through the flames of war since the late 1940s and have been through thick and thin together for decades, finally parted ways. Deng Gong resolutely "sheds tears and beheads Ma Su," transferring Zhong Tianwen to support Baosteel. This decision of Deng Gong, which goes against common sense and human morality, was criticized by the party secretary Xiao Peicheng and his own wife. Deng Gong, however, emphasized the overall situation of Hua Steel's construction and defended himself by saying: "When someone's resolve is diametrically opposed to yours, the more capable that person is, the greater the cancellation of energy." At this moment, Boss Deng is in a spiritually and morally isolated situation, and only the steel plant manager Lan Yumeng understands him. Lan Yumeng said calmly, "The boss's words make sense. One minus one equals zero, this is elementary arithmetic." Even more shocking is that Zhong Tianwen, who is generally seen as a victim of "jealousy and envy," gives Deng Gong deep understanding. On the eve of leaving Hua Steel, he walked through a cemetery where the remains of Hua Steel builders are buried, and with a heavy heart, he expressed his deep worries: "Boss, who is right and who is wrong between us? If your decision is correct, I, this disgraced loser, have no face to see my fellow countrymen again. If I am correct, I truly do not want this to become a reality! If conscience forces me to choose between the two, I would rather be a loser and sincerely wish you are correct..." Here, from "indissoluble" to a heavy parting, it far exceeds the general mold of depicting disputes over reform plans, showing the clash of different value systems in the reform tide.

I believe that the so-called "no mainstream" is probably a transitional phenomenon. Any film artist with a sense of historical participation and mission will inevitably strive tirelessly to call for and promote works that embody the spirit of the times; any nation or state rich in modern creative vitality will naturally also promote works that truly embody the spirit of the times as works with the momentum and strength to lead the mainstream.

　　时代主旋律的雄风
    ——我观《共和国不会忘记》
    黄式宪
    以大型钢铁基地的建设者在新时期的悲壮历史行进为题材的影片《共和国不会忘记》，为落潮的银幕吹拂来一片钢铁的雄风。在诸般劣质“娱乐片”中浸渗着的价值空无、意识形态浑沌和文化素质大幅度跌落的嘈杂之音的背景下，它愈发引人注目。
    《共和国》（略称）以敲击钢铁般的铿锵艺术旋律，深入到那些坚实地屹立在中国的大地上并为推进改革、开放的民族复兴大业而发热发光的建设者的灵魂振动中去，毫无畏缩、绝不羞涩地讴歌了在“文革”劫后废墟上重建共和国钢铁大厦的一代英杰，揭示了他们与共和国甘苦与共、并在走向现代化的劳动中重新“淬火”的崇高献身精神。我认为，这是银幕上疏忽久矣的一种崇高的美。它使我们时代的主旋律雄风重振、气势夺人！
    《共和国》的创作，力图从以往改革题材的窠臼中挣脱出来，诸如刻板化地写改革的事件过程或改革的方案之争，或为把改革者贴上某种“铁腕”式的特征（并不忘点染以爱情的失落或失意等“佐料”）……这部电影尽管尚未完全挣脱此类百态模式（或许，在我们革故鼎新的历史蜕变期，生活自身就存在若干模式）但是，它是锐意开拓及其所取得的令人刮目相看的艺术成就毕竟是值得嘉誉的。
    尽管中国的改革是被时代“逼”出来的——西方一些发达国家已跨入工业或后工业时代，而一度曾以世界革命中心自命的老大中国，却仍处在由农耕文明向工业文明作艰难跋涉的困顿（起初还自足于“夜郎自大”的精神迷狂）之中，不改革，我们这个民族眼看着就有被开除地球“球籍”之虞；舍改革便无存活之路。改革的钟声便这样声搏云天般地敲响了！作为华钢“大老板”（总经理）的田耕毫无疑问是从“左”的政治模式下的工业旧轨上走过来的（他并非一贯正确或自天而降的“救世主”），但却是“春江水暖”的先觉者，是被改革之钟所唤醒的激流勇进的先行者。他既是叱咤风云、敢于拚搏的改革家，率先在大型钢铁基地向中央立“军令状”搞企业承包，其后更以整个钢铁公司的固定资产做抵押向国际银团贷款，实行了破釜沉舟的“负债经营”之壮举；同时，他又不乏活生生的人的血肉及精神的复杂性，甚至被自己的女儿批评为集“新的与旧的，热情与冷酷，奉献与自私”于一身的怪老头——他在华钢是个“称职的老板”，而在家庭和诸般人际关系中则是个有着种种感情和行为缺失而“负债累累”的普通人。人们看到，田耕的性格及其精神格局，明显地呈现为一种痛苦的分裂形态。到影片最后，田耕告老离休，在钢城宛若瀑布般奔泻而下的火红铁水的背景前独步，道出一番发自肺腑却又含着某种历史的悲壮性的独白：“……仔细想一想，我到底给人们留下了点儿什么呢？——我留下了三亿五千万的外债，我留下了让四千多户职工搬进新居的诺言……我还欠下了无数的同志情、夫妻情、父女情，瞧，到头来我倒是负债累累啦！”这种深沉的反躬自省，让人仿佛可以触摸到他那毕生奉献、壮心不已的灼热的灵魂的跳动！或许，被历史所赋予的这种“未完成态”，恰恰是田耕这一改革者形象独具魅力之所在。
    涉及田耕的性格描绘，有若干相当冷峻而闪烁着改革时代之亮色的艺术笔墨。例如，在负债经营的问题上，总经济师仲天文同他意见分歧，拒绝在向国际银团的贷款协议上签字。这两个从４０年代末就一同从烈火硝烟的战场转到钢花飞溅的工业战线、数十年摸爬滚打在一起，并矢志“棒打不散”的老战友，终于分道扬镳。田耕断然“挥泪斩马谡”，将仲天文调去支援宝钢。对田耕的这个有悖常情和做人道义的决断，受到了党委书记肖沛成以及自己妻子的谴责。田耕则以华钢建设的大局为重，辩白说：“当有人和你的决心南辕北辙的时候，这个人越是能人，那么能量的抵消也就越大。”这时刻，田老板陷于精神和道义的孤立境地，只有作为他左右臂的炼钢厂厂长蓝雨蒙理解他，蓝雨蒙不动声色地说，“老板的话有道理。一减一等于零，这是小学的算术课。”更令人震撼的是，在一般人眼里被视作是“嫉贤妒能”的受害者的仲天文，却给予田耕以深深的理解。在离开华钢前夕，他走过一片安葬着华钢建设者尸骨的墓地，以二律背反式的矛盾心情吐出了沉重的忧思：“老板哥，咱们到底谁对谁错呢？如果你的决定是正确的，我这个不光彩的失败者还有何面目再见江东父老呢？如果我是正确的，我又真是一万个不愿意这将成为事实啊！假使良心逼着我在这两者之间作出选择，我宁可做一个失败者，也真诚地祝愿你是正确的……”这里，由“棒打不散”到沉重地分手，远远超出了一般写改革中方案之争的窠臼，显示了在改革大潮冲击下不同价值观的较量。
    我认为，所谓“无主潮”，大约是过渡性的现象，任何一个具有历史参与意识和时代使命感的电影艺术家，必然会群策群力地为呼唤并推进那体现着时代精神之火光的主旋律作品而奋斗不息；任何一个富于现代创造活力的民族、国家，很自然也总是要顺乎潮流地把那真正体现着时代精神之火光的主旋律作品推衍为具有引领主潮的气势和力度的作品。
