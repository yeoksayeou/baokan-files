	Poland will prioritize the development of the food economy and agricultural modernization in its party's socio-economic policies.

	This was revealed in the "Programmatic Report to the Second National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party," published in the May 2 issue of the Polish newspaper "People's Tribune." The report will be presented at the Second National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party, which opens on May 4.

	The report points out that prioritizing the development of food and agriculture is a "national necessity." This must first be reflected in the industrial, service, and technological sectors, which need to produce sufficient production materials for the development of food and agriculture. It is necessary to ensure that agricultural production is profitable.

	The report also emphasizes the need to address the restructuring of the economy, rationalization of employment, curbing inflation and stabilizing the market, and integrating the Polish economy more closely with the world economy as "urgent tasks."

	The report believes that the coexistence of the ruling political forces with the opposition, openly and sincerely determining tasks together, is the only wise and reasonable choice for Poland today.

　　波优先发展食品和农业
    新华社华沙５月２日电  波兰统一工人党将把发展食品经济和农业现代化放在党的社会—经济政策中的优先地位。
    这是波兰《人民论坛报》２日刊登的《波兰统一工人党第二次全国代表会议上的纲领性报告》中披露的。
    这项报告将在５月４日开幕的波兰统一工人党的第二次全国代表会议上提出。
    报告指出，优先发展食品和农业是“民族的需要”。这一点必须首先体现在工业、服务和科技领域中，它们要为发展食品和农业制造出足够的生产资料。要保证农业生产获得利润。
    报告同时还强调要把改造经济结构、就业合理化、遏制通货膨胀和稳定市场、把波兰经济同世界经济更紧密地联系起来等工作作为“当务之急”。
    报告认为，执政的政治力量同反对派永久共处，一道公开地、诚恳地确定任务，这对今天波兰来说是唯一明智及合理的选择。
