To address the issue of increasing personnel without increasing salaries, which has affected the acceptance of college graduates by units, Jiangxi Province recently made a decision: The Provincial Planning Commission will, based on the graduate allocation plan, promptly issue the graduate salary budget plan.

For enterprise units that link salaries to performance, the salary budget can be increased in the current year, and it will enter the salary base in the second year.
