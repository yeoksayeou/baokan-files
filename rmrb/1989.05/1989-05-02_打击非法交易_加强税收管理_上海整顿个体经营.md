Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 2nd.

Shanghai is taking steps to comprehensively rectify individual businesses and strengthen supervision and management.

By the end of last year, Shanghai had 110,000 licensed individual industrial and commercial households, employing 163,000 people. They have played a role in filling gaps in the economy and have been convenient for the public. However, currently, illegal and criminal behaviors among individual business operators are quite serious. Some evade taxes, some engage in market monopolies and price gouging, some engage in speculation and profiteering, and some gamble and fight, seriously disrupting market order and social stability.

The focus of Shanghai's current rectification of individual businesses is to resolutely shut down unlicensed operations and crack down on illegal transactions; to strengthen the rectification and tax management of licensed individual industrial and commercial households. In the first half of the year, a comprehensive census will be conducted in conjunction with license verification, with a focus on checking and dealing with illegal activities in the food, hotel services, and book industries. At the same time, Shanghai is improving relevant policies and regulations, strengthening industry management, and educating individual industrial and commercial households to operate legally and civilly.

　　打击非法交易　加强税收管理    
    上海整顿个体经营
    新华社上海５月２日电（记者何子葭）上海着手全面整顿个体经营、加强监督管理工作。
    到去年年底止，上海城乡的有证个体工商户达１１万户、１６．３万人，他们在经济生活中发挥了拾遗补缺的作用，方便了群众。但是当前个体经营者违章违法行为比较严重，有的偷税漏税，有的欺行霸市、哄抬物价，有的转手倒卖、投机倒把，有的赌博殴斗，严重扰乱市场秩序和社会治安。
    上海市这次整顿个体经营工作的重点是坚决取缔无照经营，打击非法交易；加强对有证个体工商户的整顿和税收管理，上半年结合验照全面开展普查，对问题较多的饮食业、旅馆服务业和书刊行业，分期分批进行重点检查，查处违法活动。同时，上海正在完善有关政策法规，加强行业管理。并对个体工商户做好守法经营、文明经营的教育。
