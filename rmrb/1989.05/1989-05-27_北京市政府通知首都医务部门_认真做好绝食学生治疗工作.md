	Beijing Municipal Government notified the capital's medical departments on May 26 to seriously do a good job in treating students who have gone on a hunger strike.

	The notice said, students who participated in the hunger strike petition at Tiananmen Square have already stopped their hunger strike and mostly returned to their schools. Some of these students' bodies are still very weak and need a certain amount of time to continue recovering and being treated. To ensure their physical health, the municipal government requires all institutions of higher learning to seriously pay attention to this work. The medical departments of each institution must take responsibility and conduct a physical examination for each student who participated in the hunger strike, discover any illnesses, and treat them in a timely manner. If the school's medical capabilities are insufficient, they should immediately contact the Municipal Health Bureau and municipal-affiliated hospitals. The municipal health departments and each medical unit must actively support and actively cooperate to do a good job in treatment and nursing work. For students who need to be hospitalized, every effort should be made to arrange beds and provide care.
