**People's Daily, Beijing, May 18th** — All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Chairman Rong Yiren today sent a letter to the media, stating that our country is facing the arduous tasks of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening reforms. Corruption must be eradicated; otherwise, the cause of reform and opening up will be doomed, and the future of the country and the hopes of the people will suffer serious setbacks. It is reported that the main leaders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council have begun to meet with student representatives for dialogue, hoping to clearly affirm the students' patriotic actions, accept the students' reasonable demands, and show the Party and government's determination to strengthen democracy and the legal system, oppose corruption, promote clean governance, and increase transparency.

**Agricultural and Industrial Democratic Party Chairman Lu Jiaxi Sends Letter to Zhao Ziyang**
**People's Daily** — Agricultural and Industrial Democratic Party Chairman Lu Jiaxi sent a letter to CPC Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang on May 17th, on behalf of the Agricultural and Industrial Democratic Party Central Committee, making an urgent appeal:

The current student movement is a patriotic democratic movement. It reflects the will of the broad masses of the people and has increasingly gained the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life. It is truly the will of the people and admired by the world, and it is consistent with the Party and government's stance. It should not be regarded as "turmoil."

The sit-in and hunger strike at Tiananmen Square have entered their fifth day, with thousands of lives in danger and hundreds of millions of people in pain. As a scholar who has long been engaged in higher education and scientific research, I am extremely anxious and believe that this situation can no longer be delayed! I urgently appeal to you: the high-level leaders of the Party and the state should immediately meet directly with the students for a sincere dialogue and take effective measures to save the endangered lives and meet the people's wishes. We have missed many opportunities to solve problems, and now we can no longer delay.

At this critical moment in history, with a heart of loving the Party, the country, and the people, I suggest that emergency meetings of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, the State Council, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference be convened as soon as possible to seriously address urgent issues. I also suggest that an emergency democratic consultation meeting be convened immediately between the CPC and the main leaders of the democratic parties to discuss state affairs and truly embody the spirit of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, mutual trust, and shared honor and disgrace" and the spirit of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the CPC.

**China Zhi Gong Party Chairman Dong Yincheng Issues Statement**
**People's Daily, Beijing, May 18th** — China Zhi Gong Party Central Committee Chairman Dong Yincheng today issued a statement, saying that in order to cherish the students and stabilize the situation, we hereby make an appeal:

1. We believe that this student movement is a patriotic movement, and the students' reasonable demands are consistent with the stance of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. We hope that the students' reasonable demands will be resolved within the framework of democracy and the legal system.

2. We suggest that the main leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council meet with the students as soon as possible for a dialogue.

At the same time, we sincerely hope that the students who are sitting in and hunger striking will, for the sake of the country and the nation, cherish their lives and stop the hunger strike and return to school.

**Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Sends Letter to CPC Central Committee and State Council**
**People's Daily, Beijing, May 18th** — The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Central Committee today sent a letter to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, pointing out:

1. The situation is serious, and it cannot be delayed for even a moment. Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable. The highest leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council should quickly engage in sincere dialogue with the students and resolve the problems as soon as possible to save the students' lives.

2. This student movement should be affirmed as a patriotic democratic movement, not turmoil. The students' own organizations should be recognized as legal.

3. The CPC Central Committee and the State Council should put the overall situation of the country and the nation first, understand the people's sentiments, follow the people's will, and any individual should put the country's safety first and abandon personal gains and losses.

4. Deeply reflect on the root causes of corruption in Party and government organs.

**Youth League Central Committee and Other Departments Jointly Issue Appeal**
**People's Daily** — The Communist Youth League Central Committee, the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Students' Federation issued an urgent appeal on May 17th.

1. We do not want to see the students' lives and health harmed, and we do not want to see the process of reform and construction reversed. We hope that the main leaders of the Party and the government will go to the students as soon as possible, fully understand the broad students' patriotic enthusiasm and reasonable demands, and quickly ease the development of the situation.

2. We believe that under the leadership of the Party, solving problems through sincere dialogue within the framework of democracy and the legal system is the only choice. We suggest conducting constructive dialogue without avoiding contradictions as soon as possible. We hope and believe that the Party and the government will seriously absorb the broad students' and masses' reasonable demands, make up their minds to overcome corruption, promote political and economic system reforms, improve democracy and the legal system, and advance the process of China's socialist modernization.

3. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will, from a humanitarian perspective, rescue the students who are hunger striking on the square, maintain the order of the square, and maintain the students' health and safety. We also sincerely appeal to the students who are hunger striking on the square to believe that your patriotic spirit and concern for the country's future have already gained the widespread sympathy and support of the people and the youth. For the long-term needs of China's modernization, we sincerely request you to cherish and protect your own lives and stop the hunger strike. Let us work together to make the situation develop in a rational and orderly direction. China's future is full of hope, and China's future belongs to the youth.

In recent days, hundreds of thousands of people in Beijing have taken to the streets, which is a true reflection of the people's sentiments. We sincerely hope that the Party and the government will listen to the people's voices, dare to criticize themselves, and highly value and understand the broad students' concern for the country and the people. We appeal to the highest leaders of the Party and the government to go to the students in an equal capacity, dialogue with them, and, with a spirit of being responsible to history, responsible to the country's future, and responsible to the broad students' lives and health, solve the entire situation in a calm and rational manner.

4. The Party and the government should seriously and concretely draw lessons from this student movement, stand with the broad masses of the people, accelerate political system reforms, eliminate Party corruption, promote the democratic process, improve the legal system, and establish a truly stable and united political situation to ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up.
