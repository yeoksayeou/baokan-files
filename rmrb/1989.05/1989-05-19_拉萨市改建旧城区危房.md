Lhasa City is set to renovate its old district dangerous housing. According to the Xinhua News Agency, the Tibet Autonomous Region and Lhasa City have decided to allocate 26 million yuan over the next two years to renovate all 80,000 square meters of dangerous housing. The construction project to demolish old houses and build new ones around the Barkhor Street in the old district of Lhasa is currently in full swing.

This is the largest and most heavily invested housing renovation project in the old district since the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

The old district of Lhasa covers an area of approximately three square kilometers. Despite the financial difficulties faced by the autonomous region, the regional and Lhasa municipal governments have made renovating dangerous housing a key project for the next two years. They are finding ways to secure funds and concentrating their efforts to help the more than 2,000 households living in dangerous housing move into new homes as soon as possible.

　　拉萨市改建旧城区危房
    据新华社拉萨电（记者柴怀吉）西藏自治区和拉萨市决定今明两年拨款二千六百万元，用于改造到目前为止所有的八万平方米危房。环绕八廊街的拉萨旧城区内拆旧房、建新房的建筑工程目前已进入高潮。
    这是西藏和平解放以来投资最多、规模最大的一次旧城区住宅改建工程。
    拉萨的旧城区占地约三平方公里。在自治区财力较困难的情况下，自治区和拉萨市政府仍然把改造危房作为今明两年的重点项目，想方设法挤出资金，集中力量使居住在危房中的二千余户居民尽早住进新居。
