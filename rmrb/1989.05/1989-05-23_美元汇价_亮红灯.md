The dollar exchange rate "lights red"

By Zhang Liang, Reporter for This Newspaper

Despite the central banks of the Western "G7" countries taking joint action on May 22 to sell a large amount of dollars, the dollar exchange rate continued to rise sharply. In the New York foreign exchange market, the dollar's exchange rate against the yen and the West German mark both broke through the "warning lines" of 1:140 and 1:2, respectively. In the view of the Bush administration, the dollar exchange rate reaching such a high level is like a traffic light "turning red," and thus expressed serious concern and unease through its spokesperson.

Since the beginning of this year, especially in the past few weeks, the dollar exchange rate has soared. According to statistics, the dollar's exchange rate against other major Western currencies has risen by 13% compared to the beginning of the year, with increases of 18% and 28% against the yen and the West German mark, respectively. In theory, a strong dollar should be good for the United States. However, under the current U.S. economic situation, a high dollar exchange rate is more of a disadvantage. The biggest drawback is that it makes imported goods cheaper, while exported goods become relatively more expensive, which will seriously hinder the United States' efforts to reduce its trade deficit and affect its overall economic development. Therefore, the White House refers to it as "a worrying problem."

The reasons for the sharp rise in the dollar exchange rate are numerous, but the main ones are as follows: first, U.S. interest rates are significantly higher than those of other major Western developed countries; second, the New York securities market is bullish, attracting investors to buy dollars to purchase U.S. securities; third, political instability in Japan and West Germany has led investors to shift their investments to the United States.

Economic experts here have long pointed out that the most effective way to stop the rise in the dollar exchange rate is for the "G7" member countries to coordinate their actions on interest rates, with the United States lowering its interest rates and other countries raising theirs. However, in practice, each country faces its own difficulties. For the United States, the Federal Reserve and the White House are not in sync on this issue. The Bush administration hopes that the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates, but the Federal Reserve is concerned about triggering inflation and refuses to comply. Since raising interest rates will affect economic growth, other Western countries are also reluctant to raise them abruptly.

Originally, artificially forcing the dollar to depreciate was a major effective step for the United States to reduce its huge trade deficit. The reduction of the trade deficit by over $300 billion last year was largely due to this. Now, the dollar exchange rate is rising sharply again, even exceeding the White House's expectations, which will inevitably lead to the U.S. trade deficit increasing rather than decreasing. Financial experts analyze that the dollar will remain strong at least in the near term. From this, it can be seen that the contradictions between the United States and other major Western developed countries on how to stabilize exchange rates and correct trade imbalances are inevitable. How the situation will develop remains to be seen and will undoubtedly attract attention.

### 美元汇价“亮红灯”

　　美元汇价“亮红灯”
    本报记者  张亮
    尽管西方“７国集团”的各中央银行２２日采取了大量抛售美元的联合行动，美元汇价仍一股劲地直线爬升。在纽约外汇市场，美元同日元和西德马克的比价分别突破１∶１４０和１∶２的“警戒线”。在布什政府看来，美元汇价达到如此高度犹如交通路口“亮红灯”，因而通过其新闻发言人发表声明，对此表示严重忧虑和不安。
    今年以来特别是最近几个星期，美元汇价扶摇直上。据统计，美元对其它西方主要货币的比价已比年初上升１３％，其中对日元和西德马克的上涨幅度分别高达１８％和２８％。按理说，美元坚挺对美国是件大好事。然而，在当前美国经济形势下，美元高汇价是弊多利少。最大的弊处是，它意味着进口商品变得便宜，而出口商品则变相涨价，这势必严重妨碍美国继续削减外贸逆差的种种努力，进而影响其整个经济的发展。因此，白宫称之为“一个令人忧虑的问题”。
    美元汇价猛涨的原因固然很多，但主要有这样几点：其一，美国的利率大大高于其它西方主要发达国家；其二，纽约证券市场行情看好，诱使投资者争购美元来购买美国证券；其三，日本、西德政局不稳，因而人们便把投资转向美国。
    此间经济专家早就指出，阻止美元汇价上涨势头的最有效办法是“７国集团”各成员国在利率问题上采取协调行动，美国降低利率，其它国家提高利率。但是真正做起来，都各有各的难处。就美国来说，联邦储备委员会与白宫在此问题上就步调不一。布什政府希望联邦储备委员会降低利率，而联邦储备委员会则担心再度引起通货膨胀而拒不照办。由于提高利率会影响经济增长，其它西方国家也不愿贸然拔高利率。
    本来，人为地迫使美元贬值是美国削减其庞大外贸赤字的一大有效步骤，去年贸易逆差缩减３００多亿美元在很大程度上就是归功于它。如今，美元汇价又急剧攀升，甚至超过了白宫所设想的极限，这势必导致美国的外贸逆差反降为升。金融界人士分析，美元至少在近期内仍将保持坚挺势头。由此看来，美国与其它西方主要发达国家在如何稳定汇率和纠正贸易失衡问题上的矛盾在所难免。事态究竟将如何发展，无疑会引起人们的关注。
