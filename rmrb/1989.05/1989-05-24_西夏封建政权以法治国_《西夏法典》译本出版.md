Title: The Western Xia Dynasty Governed by Law: The Western Xia Code Published
Author: Wu Guoqing
Date: 1989-05-24
Edition: 4

The Western Xia Dynasty, often referred to as the "Mysterious Kingdom," recently saw the publication of its legal code in its former capital, Yinchuan. The Western Xia Code, known as "Tian Sheng Year: Revised and New Laws and Regulations," consists of 20 chapters (with the 16th chapter missing) and 1,460 articles, all written in the Western Xia script. It is a crucial resource for studying the Western Xia's politics, economy, history, and culture, and is the most detailed legal code preserved from medieval East Asia.

The original Western Xia script of "Tian Sheng Year: Revised and New Laws and Regulations" was taken by the Russian explorer Kozlov from Heicheng in Ejin Banner, Inner Mongolia, in 1909. It is now housed in the Institute of Oriental Studies in Leningrad, Soviet Union. Despite some damage, nearly 80% of it is well-preserved. In 1987, the Moscow Publishing House published the four-volume work. After its release, the Ningxia Academy of Social Sciences organized a team to translate it into Chinese. The "Western Xia Code" published this time by the Ningxia People's Publishing House is the second volume, covering chapters one through seven.

The Western Xia Dynasty (1038-1227 AD) was a feudal regime established by a minority ethnic group in northwestern China.
