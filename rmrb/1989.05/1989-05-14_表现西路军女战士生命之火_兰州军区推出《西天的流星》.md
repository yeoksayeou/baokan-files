In the current state of the dance world, where dance dramas often focus on classical themes, the Lanzhou Military Region's Combat Song and Dance Troupe has taken a unique approach by delving into revolutionary history. They have created a dance drama titled "Meteors in the West" (directed by Zuo Qing) based on the tragic experiences of female soldiers in the Red Army's Western Route Army. After several revisions, the play has been fully choreographed and will soon premiere.

"Meteors in the West" uses the tragic fate of a female soldier from the Western Route Army to prompt reflection on history and to explore the depths of human nature. This soldier, after being captured, endured countless humiliations and was eventually forced to marry an enemy soldier. However, when they tried to return to the revolution out of love, they were rejected, shattering their last hope. During the Cultural Revolution, they faced further calamity and were both expelled from their homes.

The dance drama employs a technique of contrasting historical and contemporary elements to deepen the tragic atmosphere. Some dance segments, particularly those depicting the battle between enemy cavalry and female soldiers of the Western Route Army, and those portraying the female soldier's desolate and sorrowful state during the Cultural Revolution, are particularly striking. The drama also features lively performances of the suona dance, a traditional folk dance from Northwest China, adding to the tragic and heroic tone of the piece. The music composition is also excellent. However, the dance drama's narrative is overly detailed and descriptive, lacking overall cohesion and depth, which gives it a somewhat thin feel.

　　表现西路军女战士生命之火    
    兰州军区推出《西天的流星》
    本报５月１４日讯  记者陈原报道：在目前舞坛萧条，舞剧又多热衷于古典题材的状况下，兰州军区战斗歌舞团独树一帜，把触角伸向革命历史，创作出一部以红军西路军女兵的悲壮惨烈经历为题材的舞剧《西天的流星》（编导：左青）。经数次修改，该剧已编排完毕，将于近日正式走上舞台。
    《西天的流星》以一位西路军女兵的悲剧来引发人们深思历史，透视现实，开掘人性的丰富内涵。这位女兵被俘后经受了百般欺凌，最后又嫁给一个敌军士兵。但当他们萌生爱情后投奔革命，却遭拒绝，心存的一线希望亦被毁灭。“文革”中又飞来横祸，夫妻双双被扫地出门。
    这部舞剧以历史和现实互为衬托的手法加重了全剧的悲剧色彩，有一些舞段，尤其是表现敌人骑兵和西路军女兵搏战的场面和刻画女兵在“文革”中受辱时凄凉悲恸的心境的舞蹈，十分精采。剧中还不时穿插西北情调强烈的唢呐舞，更增添舞剧的悲壮。音乐创作也很出色。但舞剧阐释情节过多，描写太实，总体设计缺少力度，给人以单薄之感。
