Poetry is one of the cherished children of the many offspring of cultural motherhood. Poetry was born out of labor and has developed alongside it. The Chinese nation has always been fond of reciting and composing poetry. From the primitive era's "断竹、续竹、飞土..." in the "Ballad of the Weaving Girl," to the present day, countless springs have passed. The development of poetry is like the east-flowing river, ceaseless and endless. As long as history exists, poetry will endure.

In the long river of Chinese poetry, influential poets are as numerous as the stars, and influential poetry collections are as vast as the sea. As for those famous verses and phrases that have been passed down through the ages, they are like lush trees and sparkling gold, countless in number.

A nation that loves poetry has always valued the study of poetry and poetry itself. Confucius regarded the first collection of Chinese poetry, the "Book of Songs," as an important textbook for poetic education: "Why do you young men not study the 'Book of Songs'? Poetry can inspire, observe, unite, and express grievances. It can help in serving one's parents and rulers, and it can broaden one's knowledge of birds, beasts, plants, and trees." Poetry can indeed cultivate the mind, refine one's character, broaden one's knowledge, and expand one's horizons. Chinese poetry, with its several thousand years of history, is a rich cultural treasure that we must carefully excavate, inherit, and promote.

I highly appreciate the words of Mr. Zhu Guangqian: "Literature at its highest level is always poetry." The study of poetry is vast and boundless, profound and endless. I have dedicated myself to the creation and research of poetry for half a century and still dare not claim expertise. Chinese poetry, with its long history and diverse styles, has had a profound influence on later generations. The simplicity of the "Book of Songs," the strangeness and beauty of the "Chu Ci," the grandeur and sadness of the Han poetry, the elegance and fluency of the Northern and Southern Dynasties folk songs, have all had a great impact on later generations. As for Du Fu's deep and sorrowful style, Li Bai's free and unconstrained manner, Du Mu's natural and simple style, Su Shi and Xin Qiji's bold and vigorous style, they are all models for future generations. Even the minor and countercurrents in the history of poetry development, such as palace-style poetry, erotic poetry, commissioned poetry, and palindromic poetry, we can still study and learn from them from a certain perspective. The goal is to inherit the tradition, innovate the tradition, and open up new horizons for modern poetry.

　　诗学广被无边
    艾青
    诗歌是文化母亲众多儿女中的一个娇子。
    诗歌产生于劳动，它与劳动同步发展。
    中华民族是喜欢吟咏诗章的民族，从“断竹、续竹、飞土，……”的原始时代的《弹歌》算起，日月轮回，已历几千春秋。诗歌的发展，如东流之江水，无止无休，只要历史存在一日，诗歌就会长命不衰。
    在中国诗歌发展的长河中，有影响的诗人，众若星辰，有影响的诗集，浩如烟海，至于诗歌中那些脍炙人口、流布古今的华章嘉句，更似葱茏之秀木，璀璨之砂金，不可胜计。
    喜爱诗歌的民族，一向重视诗学和诗歌。对于华夏第一部诗歌总集《诗经》，孔子就把它看成重要的诗教课本：“小子何莫学夫诗？诗，可以兴，可以观，可以群，可以怨。迩之事父，远之事君；多识于鸟兽草木之名。”诗歌确实可以涵咏胸次，陶冶情操，广博见闻，开拓境界。已有几千年历史的中国诗歌，是一块蕴藏极为丰富的文化宝藏，需要我们认真加以开掘，并继承下来，弘扬开去。
    我很赞赏朱光潜先生的话：“文学到了最高境界都必定是诗。”诗学广被无边，深邃无涯。我致力于诗歌创作和研究工作，业已半个世纪，至今不敢言诗。中国诗歌，源远流长，风格多样。《诗经》的质朴无华，《楚辞》的奇谲瑰丽，建安诗歌的慷慨悲凉，南北朝民歌的隽永流畅，无疑都对后世产生极大影响。至于老杜的沉郁顿挫、老诚悲切，谪仙的飘逸旷达、伟岸不羁，乐天的自然平易、刚锋内寓，苏辛的豪放雄健、半腴迭宕，更是垂范千秋，绳墨后人。即使是诗歌发展史上的支流、逆流，诸如宫体、艳诗、应制、回文等等，我们仍可从一个角度去研究、借鉴，其目的在于继承传统，变革传统，以开拓现代诗歌的新天地。
