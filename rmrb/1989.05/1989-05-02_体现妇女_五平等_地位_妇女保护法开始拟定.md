The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress' Internal and Judicial Affairs Commission held a symposium in Kunming on drafting a women's protection law for the provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan, which concluded today. This marks the beginning of the process to draft the women's protection law.

Hu Dexiu, the director of the Women and Children's Group under the National People's Congress Standing Committee's Internal and Judicial Affairs Commission, said in an interview that since the Seventh National People's Congress, there has been a growing demand from all sectors of society to enact the "Women's Protection Law." This demand has finally been put on the agenda. The proposed "Women's Protection Law" will be China's first specialized law to protect women's rights and is designed to implement the constitutional provisions on women's "five equalities" status. It will reflect the respect for women's special social roles.
