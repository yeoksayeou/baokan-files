The large gold mine in Cangshang, Laizhou City, Shandong Province, has recently been completed and put into production. According to geological surveys, the mine has proven reserves of over 25,000 kilograms of metal and 5,050,000 tons of ore. The potential reserves are substantial, making it one of the latest large gold mines developed and put into operation in China.

This mine has developed a leading domestic technology known as the "upward layer-by-layer full tailings filling method" for mining. This method ensures the smooth progress of mining operations and saves over 2 million yuan compared to traditional filling methods.

Currently, within the city's jurisdiction, in addition to the Cangshang Gold Mine, there are three super-large gold mines: Jiaojia, Xincheng, and Sanshan Island, as well as two large gold mines: Wangershan and Jincheng.

　　莱州建成一座大型金矿
    本报讯  山东省莱州市仓上金矿前不久已建成投产。据地质部门现已探明，该矿金属储量达２．５万多公斤，矿石储量达５０５万吨，远景储量可观，这是我国新近开发投产的又一座大型金矿。
    这个矿创造出在国内领先的“上向分层全尾砂充填法”采掘技术，既保证了采掘的正常进行，又比传统的充填法节约资金２０多万元。
    现在在该市境内除仓上金矿外，已建成焦家、新城、三山岛三个特大型金矿和望儿山、金城两个大型金矿。
