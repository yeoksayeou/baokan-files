Title: Why Build Sheds for Irrigation?

While on a trip to the countryside to handle some business, I saw many farmers building sheds at the edges of their fields, near machine rooms, and by wells, all for the purpose of irrigation. When asked why they were building these sheds, the farmers angrily replied, “The electricity supply is unreliable, coming and going without any regular schedule. If we don’t stay in the fields, how can we get the water we need?”

The farmers' frustration is understandable. This spring, many places have experienced prolonged droughts, and it is precisely the time when wheat is growing and needs water. Who wouldn’t hope for a good soaking? Farmers pin their hopes for a bountiful harvest on electric irrigation, which is quite natural. Due to shortages of fuel and other reasons, the current electricity supply is generally tight, and the power supply department indeed faces difficulties. Farmers understand this. However, during this critical period when crops need water the most, I believe the power supply department can try to reduce non-essential electricity usage and allocate more power for agricultural use. If it is truly impossible to fully guarantee the power supply for agriculture, it would be best to inform the farmers in advance about the power supply schedule—when it will be cut off and when it will be restored, and for how long. This way, farmers will have a clear idea and won’t have to wait in the fields day and night, wasting so much time.

One should always consider things from the perspective of others. People get annoyed when the power goes out during a movie, so imagine how farmers feel, waiting in the fields for 24 hours a day for the chance to irrigate their crops?

### 浇地为啥搭窝棚？

　　浇地为啥搭窝棚？
    王玉轩
    下乡办事，见许多农民为了浇地，在地头田间，机房井边，搭起了窝棚。问他们为啥要搭窝棚，农民气呼呼地说：“电老爷捉我们的‘迷糊’，一会儿来一会儿去的，没个准儿，不在地里守着能中？”
    农民的气愤让人同情。今春以来，很多地方久旱无雨，正当小麦拔节抽穗时节，谁不盼着浇上一遍透水呢？农民把丰收的希望寄托在电灌上是很自然的。由于燃料缺乏等原因，当前电力供应普遍紧张，供电部门确有难处，农民们是理解的。我想，在这农作物最需要水的时节，供电部门尽量压缩各种非生产性用电，统筹安排，增加一些农用电的供给还是可能的。确实不能充分保证农用供电时，最好事先向农民群众打个“招呼”，什么时间停电，什么时间供电，供多长时间电，让农民心里有个数，不要让他们日夜守在田里，空耗很多时间。
    凡事总该设身处地为人家想想。人们看电影时碰上停电，等着来电还十分恼火呢，请想想农民为了浇地，一天２４个小时在地里干等着，心中又是啥滋味？
