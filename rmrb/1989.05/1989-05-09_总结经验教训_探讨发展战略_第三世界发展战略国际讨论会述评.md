Summarizing Experiences and Lessons, Exploring Development Strategies

——An Evaluation of the International Conference on Development Strategies for the Third World

By Chen Gong and Sun Yi, reporters of this newspaper

As the 1980s draw to a close, with the easing of international tensions, the issue of development has become increasingly prominent. In late April, representatives from 30 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, along with 12 international organizations, gathered in Beijing with Chinese scholars and experts to review the development path of developing countries in the 1980s, summarize lessons learned, and discuss development strategies for the 1990s.

The tortuous journey of developing countries in the 1980s reflects a problem: due to constraints and influences from domestic and international political and economic conditions, many developing countries, despite long-term efforts, have yet to escape the predicament of "growth without development."

In a general sense, economic growth refers to the increase in output within a national economy, while economic development not only includes this but also the structural changes in output and input, as well as the overall improvement of economic conditions. Since entering the 1980s, the gross national product of African countries has continued to grow, but due to rapid population growth, per capita income has been declining for eight consecutive years. Dr. Adam of the West German Friedrich Ebert Foundation is not exaggerating when he points out that in terms of per capita income, the African continent is now poorer than it was in the 1960s. The situation in Latin America is similar, with per capita income also declining for five consecutive years.

The representatives at the meeting believe that the heavy burden of external debt is the biggest obstacle to the economic development of developing countries. Until the 1980s, almost all economists viewed the flow of capital from developed countries to developing countries, and the transition from official capital flows to private capital flows, as progress. The flow of capital from developed countries with lower investment returns to developing countries with relatively higher returns was also seen as an effective allocation of resources. However, practice has proven that this capital flow is not necessarily a progressive phenomenon and not necessarily so "effective." By the end of 1988, the total debt of developing countries had reached $1.32 trillion, with the total debt-to-GDP ratio of debtor countries reaching 40%. The heavy debt burden of developing countries and the resulting increase in fiscal deficits, economic contraction, and market chaos have seriously disrupted the normal economic order of these countries, damaging the necessary conditions for economic development.

Another problem hindering the economic development of Third World countries is that agriculture, which accounts for a significant portion of the national economy, has not made the necessary progress. The agricultural problem in Africa is particularly prominent. Dr. Adam believes that many African countries "neglect rural development. Although they have formulated development strategies centered on rural areas, in reality, the state invests little in agriculture, and rural development projects and infrastructure plans have not been successful." Coupled with severe natural disasters, agricultural production in Africa in the 1980s was even lower than in the 1970s, with the entire continent's grain imports in the 1980s five times higher than in the 1970s. According to statistics from the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, 85% of Africa's population still lives below the poverty line. This agricultural continent in the 1980s could not even feed itself, let alone develop.

In addition, uncontrolled population growth, abnormal urban expansion, ecological deterioration, wealth disparity, and industrial structure imbalance have all to varying degrees constrained the development of the national economies of developing countries.

The "stagnation of development" in developing countries has forced their people to reflect on past development strategies: can the development model of developed countries truly achieve economic independence for developing countries?

Tang Shizhong, deputy researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, pointed out that after gaining independence, developing countries face the historical task of developing the economy and achieving economic independence. Some Western liberal economists, using the experience of developed countries, have designed a traditional industrialization development strategy for developing countries, with the growth rate of gross national product as the main goal. Under this strategy, developing countries began their industrialization movements in the 1950s and 1960s with the goal of catching up with developed countries. Decades of practice have shown that, except for a few developing countries or regions that have succeeded, most have not achieved their predetermined goals.

The reasons for this, according to many participants, include the fact that any country's development strategy must be based on its own national conditions and adjusted according to different stages of development and economic conditions. A rigid strategy that remains unchanged for decades is bound to have problems. Additionally, ignoring changes in the international environment is also a reason why most developing countries have not fully achieved their strategic goals. Mr. Hill, assistant to the executive secretary of the Latin American Economic System, expressed concern that the favorable international conditions for the outward-looking development strategies adopted by some Asian countries and regions in the 1960s and 1970s are not available to Latin American countries today. Now, foreign capital is hard to borrow, protectionism is severe, and the trend towards trade bloc formation are all unfavorable factors for Latin American countries to expand exports.

Mr. Nasim, director of the Development Planning Division of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, also agrees, "High interest rates and the debt crisis have reduced the funds flowing to developing countries from private and commercial channels," "Many developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region are eager to seize trade opportunities through outward-looking trade, but international trade is increasingly constrained by protectionism, and there is a trend towards more bilateral or regional economic arrangements." Even representatives from Asia-Pacific countries and regions that have been relatively successful in export-oriented development have realized that "the initial economic structural adjustments benefited from the influence of several favorable factors, and some of these favorable conditions no longer exist even for the developing countries in this region."

Some representatives believe that the total volume of world trade is limited. If Asian developing countries all follow the "four little dragons," and Latin America follows Asia, this strategy may further deepen the external dependence of developing countries, leading to a situation where developing countries compete for the limited international market. The result may be that the main beneficiaries are not the developing countries.

Obviously, developing countries cannot blindly follow the models of other countries. Formulating a development strategy requires considering the national conditions, and changes in the international environment cannot be ignored. What was successful in the past may not be successful under current conditions, and what works in one place may not work in another.

While summarizing experiences and lessons, representatives from various countries actively explore social and economic development strategies suitable for their own countries. Although their views differ, this pragmatic attitude provides new insights and hope.

Wang Shu, director of the Chinese Institute of International Studies, pointed out in his speech: The current trend of détente and dialogue in the international arena has brought good opportunities for the development of national economies in Third World countries, but the comprehensive national power competition, with economic and technological strength as its main content, will make the task of developing national economies for Third World countries more arduous. The comprehensive national power competition may widen the gap between them and developed countries. Obviously, the old development model cannot help the majority of developing countries get out of the predicament, and new pressures are coming one after another. Adjusting the old economic development strategy has become an urgent task for the vast majority of Third World countries.

Some scholars believe that development does not necessarily mean replacing "traditional" sectors with "modern" ones. The new path of development should start from the existing strength of the country, with less emphasis on "progressiveness," and if necessary, even sacrificing the "catch-up" opportunities (which are meaningful only to a few countries).

Others propose a comprehensive social and economic development strategy, advocating shifting the focus from pursuing the growth of gross national product to meeting the basic living needs of the majority; from focusing on industrial development to focusing on agricultural development, and from urban to rural and remote areas.

Professor Lin Manding of the University of Mauritius places more emphasis on economic and technological cooperation among developing countries. Mr. Bianqui, assistant executive secretary of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, believes that to achieve stable development for the vast majority of developing countries, it is necessary to improve their international trade status (including increasing the export of manufactured goods and effectively replacing imports), adjust social policies, strive for domestic savings, and improve investment allocation. Some propose releasing market energy and redefining the relationship between market mechanisms and state intervention from the perspective of increasing economic vitality.

This conference did not issue a communiqué, did not make a declaration, and did not even reach a unified understanding or a consensus. However, representatives from various countries, from different angles such as government decision-makers, think tank consultants, and international organization officials, provided more information and stronger targeting through multi-level discussions. The significance of mutual learning is more profound. For a developing China, the enlightenment of other countries' development experiences is undoubtedly beneficial, but the warnings and admonitions produced by other countries' problems and lessons may be more practical and important.

　　总结经验教训　探讨发展战略    
    ——第三世界发展战略国际讨论会述评
    本报记者  陈功  孙毅
    ８０年代即将结束，随着国际局势出现缓和的趋势，发展问题就显得格外突出。４月下旬，来自亚、非、拉３０个国家和１２个国际组织的代表与中国的学者、专家聚首北京，回顾８０年代发展中国家的发展历程、总结切磋经验教训、探讨９０年代的发展战略。
    　　　　发展中国家８０年代走过的曲折道路，反映出一个问题：由于国内
    　　和国际政治经济条件的制约和影响，许多发展中国家虽经长期努力，却
    　　依旧未能摆脱“有增长而无发展”的困境。
    从一般意义上说，经济增长是指国民经济中产出的增加，而经济发展则不仅于此，还包括随着产出的增加而出现的产出与投入的结构上的变化以及一般经济条件的改善。进入８０年代以来，非洲各国的国民生产总值尽管一直有所增长，但是由于人口骤增，人均收入却连续８年不断下降。西德艾伯特基金会的亚当博士就并非危言耸听地指出：就人均收入而论，现在的非洲大陆比６０年代还穷。拉丁美洲的情况也十分相似，人均收入也已连续５年下降。
    与会代表们认为，发展中国家承受的巨额外债负担是阻碍发展中国家经济发展的最大障碍。直到８０年代以前，几乎所有的经济学家都把资本从发达国家向发展中国家的流动、以及由官方资本流动转为私人资本流动视为一种进步，资本从投资效益率较低的发达国家流向收益率相对较高的发展中国家，也被认为是资源的有效配置。但实践证明，这种资本流动未必全是进步现象，也未必那么“有效”。到１９８８年底，发展中国家的债务总额已达1．32万亿美元，外债总额占债务国国内生产总值的比例高达40％。发展中国家沉重的债务负担以及由此而产生的财政赤字增大，经济萎缩、市场混乱已经严重地破坏了这些国家正常的经济秩序，损害了各国经济发展所必需的条件。
    阻碍第三世界国家经济发展的另一个问题是在国民经济中占有较大比重的农业未能取得应有的进步。非洲的农业问题尤为突出。亚当博士认为，不少非洲国家“忽视农村的发展。虽然制定了以农村为中心的发展战略，但实际上国家对农业的投资少，农村发展项目和基础设施计划没有取得成功”。再加上严重的自然灾害，８０年代非洲的农业生产甚至低于７０年代的水平，整个大陆的粮食进口８０年代比７０年代增加了５倍。据联合国非洲经济委员会的官员统计，８５％的非洲人口仍生活在贫困线以下。这个农业大陆在８０年代尚不能自食其力，维持生存，更何谈发展。
    此外，人口增长失控、城市畸形膨胀、生态环境恶化、贫富两极分化、产业结构失衡等都不同程度地制约了发展中国家国民经济的发展。
    　　　　发展中国家“发展的停滞”迫使这些国家的人们对以往的发展战略
    　　进行反思：套用发达国家的发展模式，能否真正使发展中国家实现经济
    　　独立？
    中国社会科学院的谈世中副研究员指出，发展中国家独立后面临着发展经济、争取经济独立的历史任务。西方一些自由派经济学家套用发达国家的经验，为发展中国家设计了工业化传统发展战略，将国民生产总值的增长速度作为追求的主要目标。在这种战略指导下，发展中国家于５０—７０年代先后开始了以赶超发达国家为目标的工业化运动。几十年的实践证明，除少数发展中国家或地区获得成功外，大多数未能达到预定目标。
    究其原因，不少与会者认为，任何一个国家的发展战略都要依据自己的国情而定，依据发展阶段的不同、经济发展状况的差异而随时调整，几十年一贯制的僵化战略难免出问题。此外，忽视国际环境的变化，也是大多数发展中国家未能完全实现其战略目标的原因。拉美经济体系常务秘书助理希尔先生就不无忧虑地指出，６０—７０年代亚洲一些国家和地区采取外向型发展战略的一些有利的国际条件，今天拉美国家就无法得到。如今外资难借，贸易保护主义严重，贸易集团化趋势等都是拉美国家扩大出口的不利因素。
    联合国亚太经社委员会发展规划司司长纳西姆先生也有同感，“高利率和债务危机已经使从私人和商业性渠道流向发展中国家的资金减少”，“许多亚太地区的发展中国家急切地要通过外向型贸易来抓住贸易机会，但国际贸易越来越受到保护主义的制约，且出现了日益增多的双边或区域性经济安排的趋向”。就连那些搞出口导向比较成功的亚太国家和地区的代表也意识到，“初期的经济结构调整得益于若干有利因素的影响，而其中一些有利条件现在即使对这个地区的发展中国家来说也不复存在”。
    另有代表认为，世界贸易的总容量是有限的，如果亚洲发展中国家都学“四小”，拉美又学亚洲，这种战略可能进一步加深发展中国家的对外依附性，导致发展中国家争夺有限的国际市场的局面，其结果，主要得益者恐怕不是发展中国家。
    显然，发展中国家在发展中不能盲目地套用别国的模式。制定发展战略，本国的国情需要考虑，变化了的国际环境也不容忽视，以往成功的，在现实条件下未必成功，彼地奏效的，此地未必奏效。
    在总结经验教训的同时，各国代表积极探索符合本国情况的社会经济发展战略，尽管所言各异，但这种求实的态度，给人以新的启示和希望。
    中国国际问题研究所所长王殊的发言指出：当前国际上缓和与对话的趋势给第三世界国家发展民族经济带来了良好的机遇，但以经济科技为主要内容的综合国力竞赛将使第三世界国家在发展民族经济中面临更为艰巨的任务，综合国力竞赛有可能拉大它们同发达国家之间的差距。显然，旧的发展模式不能使大多数发展中国家摆脱困境，新的压力又纷至沓来，调整旧有的经济发展战略已成为广大第三世界国家的一项紧迫任务。
    有的学者认为，发展未必是用“现代化”部门代替“传统的”部门，发展的新途径应该是从本国现有的实力出发，少强调些“进步性”，必要时甚至可以牺牲（只对少数国家有意义的）“赶超”机会。
    有人则提出社会经济综合发展战略，主张把发展重心从片面追求国民生产总值的增长，转移到满足大多数人基本生活需要；从重点发展工业，转移到重点发展农业，从城市移向农村、边远地区。
    毛里求斯大学林满登教授则更多地强调发展中国家之间的经济和科技合作。联合国拉美经委会助理执行秘书比安基先生认为，要使广大发展中国家获得稳定的发展，必须改善它们的国际贸易地位（包括增加制造业的出口和有效地替代进口），调整社会政策，争取国内储蓄，改进投资分配等。还有人从增加经济活力出发，提出释放市场能量，重新确定市场机制与国家干预的关系等等。
    这次会议没有发布公报，没有提出宣言，甚至没有统一认识、得出一致结论。然而，各国代表从政府决策者、智囊咨询者和国际组织官员的不同角度，多层次的各抒己见，却提供了更多的信息和更强的针对性，相互借鉴的意义更为深远。对发展中的中国来讲，别国发展经验的启示固然有益，但他人的问题和教训所产生的提醒、告诫作用也许更为实惠和重要。
