		A leader of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army expressed gratitude on behalf of the martial law troops for the support from the capital and people from all walks of life nationwide.

		New China News Agency, Beijing, May 28th: The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army reports: Since some units of the People's Liberation Army were ordered to carry out martial law in parts of Beijing, they have continuously received letters of encouragement and donations from various organizations, enterprises, schools, mass organizations, neighborhood committees, residents, and individual business owners. Additionally, there have been numerous donations of food, beverages, vegetables, meat, eggs, and other gifts. The leaders of the General Political Department believe that this fully demonstrates the broad masses' support for the Party Central Committee and the State Council's correct decision to quickly stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation. It also shows the concern and affection of various sectors of society for the soldiers. This is a great encouragement and inspiration for the troops carrying out martial law and all the officers and soldiers of the army. The martial law troops' broad masses of officers and soldiers will express their heartfelt thanks to the broad masses of the people on behalf of the General Political Department!

		The leaders of the General Political Department said that at present, the martial law troops, under the organization of the rear service departments and the care of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and some district and county leadership organizations, as well as the broad masses of the people, have had their food and accommodation properly arranged, and their material supplies are guaranteed. The weather in the Beijing area is becoming increasingly hot, and it is difficult to preserve donated items, especially food, during transportation, which may lead to waste. In view of the above situation, please do not send any more donations or gifts to the martial law troops. The sons and daughters of the people are determined to complete the martial law mission well, to respond to the trust of the Party and the government with actual actions, and to respond to the concern of the people of all ethnic groups in the capital and the country.

　　总政治部领导同志代表戒严部队
    感谢首都和全国各界人士的支持
    新华社北京５月２８日电  人民解放军总政治部消息：人民解放军一些部队奉命担负北京部分地区戒严任务以来，不断收到一些机关、企业、院校和群众团体、街道居民、个体户等各界人士的慰问信和捐款，还有不少食品、饮料、蔬菜、肉蛋和其他慰问品。总政领导同志认为，这充分体现了广大群众对党中央、国务院迅速制止动乱、稳定局势的正确决策的拥护与支持，体现了社会各界对子弟兵的关怀与爱戴。这对担负戒严任务的部队和全军官兵都是很大激励和鼓舞，戒严部队广大官兵要总政代表他们向广大人民群众表示深切的感谢！
    总政领导同志说，目前，戒严部队在后勤部门的组织和北京市委、市政府和一些区、县领导机关以及广大人民群众的关怀下，食宿都得到了妥善安排，物资供应是有保证的。北京地区天气日渐炎热，赠送物品特别是食品在运送途中不好保存，容易造成浪费，鉴于上述情况，请不要再向戒严部队赠款赠物。人民子弟兵决心完成好戒严任务，以实际行动回答党和政府的重托，回答首都和全国各族人民的关怀。
