Ou Yang Yu Qian is a renowned polymath in the field of Chinese arts and culture in modern times. He has made pioneering and reformative contributions in various fields such as drama, opera, film, dance, and education, dedicating his entire life to the cause of Chinese cultural development and achieving remarkable accomplishments.

Today, May 1st, marks the 100th anniversary of Ou Yang Yu Qian's birth.

There are three outstanding pioneers in the history of Chinese drama: Ou Yang Yu Qian, Hong Shen, and Tian Han. By age, Ou Yang is 100 years old, Hong Shen is 95, and Tian Han is 90. The year Ou Yang was born, Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty began his personal rule, Zhang Zhidong petitioned to build the Beijing-Hankou Railway, and Guangdong established its first arsenal, marking the start of the Self-Strengthening Movement. The year Hong Shen was born, the First Sino-Japanese War broke out, the Beiyang Fleet was destroyed, and the following year, the Qing government sent Li Hongzhang to Japan to negotiate the Treaty of Shimonoseki, a humiliating treaty. Tian Han was born in the 24th year of the Guangxu era, which was also the time of the Hundred Days' Reform led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, and the martyrdom of Tan Sitong and five other patriots. Ou Yang and Hong Shen were born into official families, while Tian Han was a farmer's son. Despite their different backgrounds and experiences, their childhoods were all marked by the era of national crisis and suffering, and they were all influenced by the patriotic spirit of the times before and after the Xinhai Revolution. In 1904, Ou Yang went to Japan to study, and the following year, he witnessed the "Suppression of Chinese Students" incident by the Japanese Ministry of Education and the tragic suicide of Chen Tianhua. In 1907, he participated in the Spring Willow Society initiated by Zeng Xiaoguo and performed "The Black Slave's Lament," marking the beginning of the Chinese drama movement. However, this play was an adaptation of a foreign novel, addressing the issue of racial discrimination against African Americans. The earliest original Chinese drama was "The Pear Seller" written by Hong Shen in 1915, "The Tragedy of the Poor" written in 1916, and around the same time, Ou Yang Yu Qian's "Motive Force." These plays were all performed before the May Fourth Movement, predating Hu Shi's "A Lifetime Event" by four or five years. At that time, as Tian Han put it, they were all "artistic youths who indulged in alcohol, rode horses, were righteous, and shouted 'bombs, bombs'." However, Chinese drama from the beginning reflected the era and cared about the lives of the oppressed masses, which is a very precious tradition.

The 1920s in China was a time of great upheaval. Almost all progressive intellectuals experienced a period of confusion, wandering, exploration, and setbacks. However, history arranged it perfectly: in 1922, Ou Yang Yu Qian, Hong Shen, and Tian Han, the three founders of the Chinese drama movement, gathered in Shanghai. They were united in their concern for the country and the people, their opposition to the unjust old society, and their desire to speak for the common people. They were also united in their fearlessness of hardships and their willingness to dedicate their lives to the cause of drama. However, the path from patriotism and humanitarianism to communism was not smooth. They all had different fantasies and attempts, different successes and setbacks. From 1922, when they first met, they cooperated very well for a long time, truly becoming lifelong friends through thick and thin. However, in the drama movement and creative practice, there were also disagreements and debates among them. From 1930, when Tian Han and Hong Shen joined the "Left Wing" and the "Drama League," until the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, Ou Yang had several heated debates with Tian and Hong, as Tian Han said: "Ou Yang cooperated with me and Hong Shen, but sometimes we did not. Looking back at Ou Yang's relationship with me, there was never a time when we did not cooperate at all. He went to England and France, visited the Soviet Union twice, and participated in the first Soviet Drama Festival. He easily demanded the technical level of European peacetime from our wartime and revolutionary dramas. He often criticized our drama actors for not being able to speak. This hit the nail on the head. To improve the artistic level of our drama, we should indeed strengthen the actors' basic training in language. However, he absolutized the technical issue.... At that time, many of our drama workers took up drama because they wanted to revolutionize and resist the invasion. In other words, most of them were latecomers, and few were graduates of drama schools. Overemphasizing formal training would inevitably lead to contradictions." From this disagreement, a debate known as the "Polishing School" versus the "Rushing School" emerged in Chongqing and Guilin at that time. Ou Yang emphasized art and basic skills; Tian Han emphasized the mission and the need to rush for the revolution and resistance; Hong Shen, I think, was between the two. He was a disciple of the American drama educator Baker and had a complete drama theory. On the one hand, he insisted on writing scripts with rules and rehearsing with procedures, but as a social activist known as the "Black Whirlwind" in the drama world, he sometimes rushed, even more daringly than Tian Han. He could write a script in three to five days and could temporarily perform a role on stage. On the eve of the Anti-Japanese War, he wrote "The Salted Fish Philosophy," which I urged him to complete in one night, and in 1942, he wrote "Yellow and White Ink," which he gave me a topic to write a story outline, and then with a few strokes of his pen, he completed it in less than three days. In terms of ideology, the red line of loving the country and fighting for democracy made them walk on the same path, but in artistic practice, the conflict between rushing tasks and seeking quality—between rushing and polishing—caused them to constantly debate and disagree. Now, the problem is very clear: in essence, this is a problem that has not been well solved in the history of modern Chinese literature since the 1920s until now—the relationship between politics and art. In revolutionary and wartime, when fish and bear's paw cannot be had at the same time, it is difficult for any artist to avoid some eccentricity between politics and art. On this, Tian Han later said very frankly in the preface to Ou Yang's collection: "We have never belittled technique, but we have paid more attention to the political mission, so we did not hesitate to rush out dramas night and day, so we were called the 'Rushing School,' while Ou Yang's art school represented the so-called 'Polishing School.' Who would not want to polish their art more? It's just that we do not advocate polishing for the sake of polishing. We advocate polishing while rushing.... Although we argued heatedly about art in a three-teachings café in Guilin, our views obviously quietly approached each other, and our contradictions were naturally resolved." Ou Yang was meticulous, Tian Han was unrestrained, and Hong Shen was "a blend of elegance and vulgarity, difficult to distinguish." Such three dramatists with distinct personalities and characteristics "cooperated and did not cooperate" for decades, which is a history of the founding of Chinese drama.

Drama in China has a thousand-year-old tradition, but spoken drama (Ibsen model) has only been around for 80 years since the Spring Willow Society. Introducing a brand-new foreign art form and making it take root, sprout, bloom, and bear fruit in Chinese soil inevitably involves a process of exploration, experimentation, and assimilation—Chineseization. In this process, clashes and struggles between the East and West, innovation and tradition, and artistic and political tasks are inevitable. In literature, there is the struggle between new poetry and old poetry; in the art world, there is the struggle between Western painting and Chinese painting; in the music world, there is the struggle between Western music and Chinese music, and even between foreign voices and local voices. This struggle between the East and West, the new and the old, has continued, sometimes openly and sometimes covertly, to this day, 40 years after the founding of the nation. Compared to other arts, traditional Chinese drama (Beijing Opera, Kunqu, and various local operas) has the greatest potential and the deepest influence among the people. However, it is worth our pride that, looking back at the 80-year history of spoken drama from its introduction to the present, there has been very little sectarianism and personal rivalry between the traditional drama and spoken drama circles. Why? The main reason is that the three founders of the spoken drama movement—Ou Yang, Hong Shen, and Tian Han—all had a deep understanding and appreciation of Chinese history and traditional drama. Ou Yang not only studied and performed Beijing Opera but also was famous alongside Mei Lanfang in the 1920s, known as the "Northern Mei and Southern Ou." Tian Han was interested in Xiang Opera and Beijing Opera from a young age. When he returned to Shanghai from Japan and established the Art University and the "Southern National Society," he befriended Zhou Xinfan and Gao Baishui. In 1927, he established the "Fish and Dragon Society" and invited Zhou Xinfan, Gao Baishui, and Tang Huichun to jointly perform Ou Yang Yu Qian's "Pan Jinlian." Hong Shen once told me that he loved Beijing Opera from a young age. While teaching at Fudan University, he researched Kunqu with Professor Zhao Jingshen. After joining the Southern National Society, he developed a deep friendship with Zhou Xinfan. The drama circle may still remember that in the early days of liberation, he performed a Beijing Opera with Mei Lanfang and Zhou Xinfan at the Huairen Hall. Because of this, the entire spoken drama circle, from Ou Yang, Tian Han, and Hong Shen to Cao Yu, Jiao Juhui, Ma Yanhua, Wu Zuoliang, and up to the present, has never opposed tradition and has never seen nationalism. Spoken drama workers have always learned from and cooperated with Beijing Opera and local opera workers. Not opposing tradition does not mean being conservative and stuck in the past. They have all made great contributions to the reform of Beijing Opera and local opera.

Ou Yang was meticulous in his studies and humble in his learning. I was touched by reading his late autobiography: "Who am I? I am an active member of the drama movement. Despite making mistakes and taking detours, I am a thorough and through active member. I have always fought for this my whole life. I have been an actor, a director, a scriptwriter, and a researcher. I have worked on spoken drama, opera, and local drama. All of this is for the movement. Mistakes are due to limited ability, but I have never retreated from the drama movement in my life. In the past, I cooperated with Tian Han and Hong Shen, but sometimes I did not. This is common in the movement. In that environment, it was all about forging ahead, rushing ahead, and I have never compromised on the general direction. In Guangdong, from my works, it can be seen that at that time I was not a Marxist, but I yearned for democracy. In Guangxi, the plays I directed were all for the resistance war, and the plays I wrote were also for the resistance war."

Ou Yang Yu Qian dedicated more than half a century to the cause of Chinese drama. He is a true drama master, an outstanding playwright, a performing artist, and a film artist. More importantly, he dedicated his life to drama education. In the early days, he established the Linggong School in Nantong, the Drama Research Institute in Guangdong, and the Guangxi Art Institute in Guilin. After liberation, he founded and directed the Central Academy of Drama. He valued the foundation of drama education and emphasized dialogue training. He personally formulated physical education materials, personally led the dialogue teaching and research group, and personally demonstrated and rehearsed for students, teaching diligently and tirelessly, cultivating a large number of drama talents for New China. He pursued truth, loved his country, and after a lifetime of hard work, finally joined the Communist Party of China in his late years. His unwavering loyalty to the revolutionary cause and the drama education cause has set a high example for future generations.

　　纪念艺术大师欧阳予倩百岁诞辰
    夏衍
    欧阳予倩是中国近现代史上声名卓著的文艺通才，他在话剧、戏曲、电影、舞蹈、教育等多方面的领域都有开创之功、改革之功，为中国文化事业奉献出毕生心血，业绩丰厚。
    今年５月１日，是欧阳予倩百岁冥诞。
    中国话剧有三位杰出的开山祖，这就是欧阳予倩、洪深和田汉。按年龄，欧阳今年１００岁，洪深９５岁，田汉９０岁。欧阳予倩出生那一年光绪帝载湉亲政，张之洞奏请筹建京汉铁路，广东建设了第一个兵工厂，洋务运动开始。洪深出世那一年，发生了甲午战争，北洋舰队覆灭，翌年清政府派李鸿章赴日求和，缔结了辱国的马关条约。田汉出生于光绪二十四年，也正是康有为、梁启超的戊戌变法失败，谭嗣同等六君子英勇就义的时刻。欧阳和洪深出生于官宦之家，而田汉则是农家子弟，门第不同，经历不同，但他们的童年都处在国破家亡、民生涂炭的时代，都亲身受到了辛亥革命前后的爱国图存这种时代精神的影响。欧阳予倩于１９０４年赴日本留学，下一年就碰上了日本文部省“取缔清国留学生”事件，目睹了陈天华投海自杀的悲剧。１９０７年他参加了曾孝谷等发起的春柳社，演出了《黑奴吁天录》，这是中国话剧运动的开端，但这出戏是外国小说的改编，写的是美国黑人反对种族歧视的问题。中国人自己创作的话剧，则最早是１９１５年洪深写的《卖梨人》，１９１６年写的《贫民惨剧》，和差不多同时欧阳予倩写的《运动力》，这些剧本都演出在五四运动之前，要比胡适的《终身大事》早四五年。那时候，按田汉的说法，他们都还是“使酒纵马，豪气凌云，嫉恶如仇，高喊‘炸弹、炸弹’的艺术青年”。可是中国话剧一开始就反映了当时的时代，就关怀到被压迫的劳苦大众的生活，这应该说是一个非常可贵的传统。
    本世纪２０年代在中国历史上是一个地覆天翻的时代，中国先进的知识分子几乎无一例外地都经历了一段苦闷、彷徨、探索和挫折的过程。但是历史安排得很巧，１９２２年，欧阳予倩、洪深、田汉这三位中国话剧运动的奠基人在上海汇合了。忧国忧民，反对不合理的旧社会，要为平民鸣不平，他们之间是完全一致的；不怕艰险，愿为戏剧事业而奋斗终身，他们之间也是完全一致的。但是，从爱国主义、人道主义走向共产主义，道路就不那么平坦了，他们都有过不同的幻想和尝试，也有过不同的成功和挫折，他们从１９２２年缔交之后，一直合作得很好，很久，真可以说是生死患难之交，但是，在话剧运动和创作实践中，他们之间也不是没有过分歧和争论。从１９３０年田汉、洪深加入了“左联”和“剧联”起，一直到抗日战争初期，予倩和田、洪之间就不止一次发生过面红耳赤的争论，正如田汉所说：“予倩和我与洪深合作，但有时也不合作。回溯一下予倩和我的关系，完全不合作的时候是没有的，他到过英、法，两入苏联，而且参加了第一届苏联戏剧节，他很容易用欧洲和平时期的技术水平来要求我们的抗战演剧和革命戏剧，他常常批评我们的话剧演员不会说话。这话说中了要害，为了提高我们话剧的艺术水平，完全应该加强演员们在语言方面的基本训练，但是，他却把技术问题绝对化了。……当时，我们许多戏剧工作者都是因为要革命、要抗战而搞上戏剧的，换句话说，多半是半路出家，很少是戏剧学校出身的，过度强调正规训练，就不能不引起矛盾。”从这种分歧出发，就形成了一场当时出现在重庆和桂林的所谓“磨光派”和“突击派”的论争。予倩强调艺术，强调基本功；田汉则强调任务，强调为革命和抗战而突击；洪深呢，我看是介于两者之间。他是美国戏剧教育家贝克的入门弟子，他有一套完整的戏剧理论，他一方面坚持写剧本要有章法，排戏要有程序，但由于他是一个被称为戏剧界“黑旋风”的社会活动家，所以他有时搞突击，比田汉还要勇敢。他可以三天五天赶写一个剧本，可以临时上台串演一个角色，抗战前夕他写的《咸鱼主义》，是我逼着他在一个晚上赶出来的，１９４２年他写的《黄白丹青》，是他出了一个题目，要我给他写了一个故事梗概，然后大笔一挥，不到三天就写出来的。在思想上，爱祖国、争民主这条红线使他们走上了同一条大路，但在艺术实践上，赶任务和求质量——也就是搞突击和重磨光又使他们不断地发生争论和分歧。现在看来，问题已经是很清楚了，说到底，这也就是二十年代以来直到现在为止，中国现代文学史上的一个始终没有得到很好解决的政治与艺术的关系问题。在革命和战争年代，在鱼与熊掌不可兼得的时候，任何一个艺术家在政治与艺术之间有一点偏奇是难于避免的。对此，田汉后来在替予倩的文集作序的时候说得很坦率：“我们从来是不轻视技巧的，但我们更多地着重政治任务所在，所以不惜夜以继日地把戏剧突击出来，因此我们被称为‘突击派’，而予倩的艺术馆则代表着所谓‘磨光派’。谁不愿把自己的艺术磨得更光一点呢？只是我们不主张为磨光而磨光，我们是主张在突击中磨光的。……我们和予倩虽则在桂林的一家三教咖啡馆楼上为艺术问题而争得面红耳赤，但我们的观点显然悄悄的接近了，我们的矛盾很自然地解决了”。欧阳谨严，田汉豪放，洪深则是“雅俗共赏、清浊难分”。这样三位各具个性和特点的戏剧家“既合作又不合作”了几十年，这就是一部中国话剧的创业史。
    戏剧在中国有上千年的悠久传统，而话剧（易卜生模式）则从春柳社算起，也还只有８０年的历史。引进一种崭新的外国艺术样式而要让它在中国的大地上生根、发芽、开花结果，必然要经过一个探索、尝试、融化——也就是中国化的过程，而在这个过程中，又不可避免地会出现中与西、创新与传统、艺术与政治任务之间的撞击和斗争。文学方面有新诗与旧体诗的斗争，美术界有洋画与国画之争，音乐界有西乐与国乐，乃至洋嗓子与土嗓子之争。这种中与西、新与旧的斗争，甚至或明或暗地持续到建国４０年后的今天。和其他艺术相比，中国传统戏剧（京剧、昆曲和各种地方戏）的潜力最大，在人民群众中的影响最深，可是值得我们骄傲的是，回顾一下话剧从引进到现在这８０年的历史，传统戏剧和话剧界之间，却很少有门户之见和意气之争。原因何在？主要是因为话剧运动的这三位奠基人——欧阳、洪深、田汉都对中国历史和传统戏剧有很深的造诣和理解。予倩不仅学过和演过京剧，２０年代就和梅兰芳齐名，有北梅南欧之誉。田汉在幼年就对湘剧和京剧有兴趣，他从日本回到上海，办艺术大学和“南国社”时，就结识了周信芳、高百岁，１９２７年办“鱼龙会”，就约周信芳、高百岁和唐槐秋等联合演出了欧阳予倩的《潘金莲》。洪深曾和我说过，他从小就爱看京戏，在复旦大学任教时曾和赵景深教授研究过昆曲，参加了南国社之后，就和周信芳有了深厚的友谊。戏剧界可能还记得，解放初期，他在怀仁堂和梅兰芳、周信芳同台客串过一台京戏。由于此，整个话剧界不论从南到北，从欧阳、田汉、洪深到曹禺、焦菊隐、马彦祥、吴祖光，直到现在，话剧界没有人反对过传统，没有出现过民族虚无主义，话剧工作者是一直和京剧、地方戏工作者相互借鉴、团结合作的。不反传统并不等于保守和泥古，他们都为革新京剧和地方戏而做出了巨大的贡献。
    予倩治学谨严，同时又谦虚好学，我感动地读过一篇他晚年的自述：“我是一个什么人呢？我是一个戏剧运动的积极分子。尽管犯过错误，走过弯路，但我是彻头彻尾的积极分子。我自己肯定我一直为此奋斗了一生。我当过演员，当过导演，写过剧本，搞过研究工作，搞过话剧、歌剧、地方戏，这一切都是为了运动。有错误那是水平所限，但我一生为戏剧运动没有退缩过。过去曾和田汉、洪深同志合作，但有时也不合作。这是在运动中常有的事。在那个环境中就是闯，乱闯，在总的方向上我没有妥协过。在广东一段，从我的作品可以看出来，那时我不是马克思主义者，但是向往民主。在广西我所排的戏完全为了抗战，我自己写的戏，也是为了抗战。”
    欧阳予倩为中国戏剧事业奋斗了半个多世纪，他是名副其实的戏剧大师、优秀的剧作家、表演艺术家、电影艺术家。更重要的是他毕生从事戏剧教育，早年在南通办过伶工学校，在广东办过戏剧研究所，在桂林办过广西艺术馆，解放以后他创办和主持了中央戏剧学院。他重视戏剧的基础教育，重视台词训练，曾亲自制定形体教材，亲自任台词教研组组长，亲自为学生示范排演，言传身教，诲人不倦，为新中国造就了大批戏剧人才。他一生追求真理、热爱祖国，经过艰苦奋斗，终于在年近古稀的时候，加入了中国共产党。他对革命事业，对戏剧教育事业的无限忠诚，给后一辈人树立了崇高的榜样。
