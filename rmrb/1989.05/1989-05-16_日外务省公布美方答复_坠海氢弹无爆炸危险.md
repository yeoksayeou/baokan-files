Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th.

The Japanese Foreign Ministry today released the U.S. government's response regarding a bomber carrying a hydrogen bomb that crashed into the sea 24 years ago. The U.S. stated that the hydrogen bomb poses no risk of explosion.

The U.S. government explained that the hydrogen bomb carried by the aircraft was structurally damaged during its descent to the seabed. The nuclear material and the high-explosive material used to trigger a nuclear explosion were soaked by seawater and dissolved within a short period, settling on the seabed. It is unlikely that an explosion will occur in the future, and it will not have any impact on the environment.

Local opinion suggests that although the U.S. government has provided a response and the Japanese Foreign Ministry has expressed understanding, this issue is related to Japan's "three non-nuclear principles." There may still be debates within Japan.

　　日外务省公布美方答复    
    坠海氢弹无爆炸危险
    新华社东京５月１５日电  日本外务省今天公布了美国政府关于２４年前一架携带氢弹的攻击机坠海事件的答复。美国称这颗氢弹已无爆炸危险。
    美国政府说，这架飞机所携带的氢弹已在沉入海底过程中发生结构性破坏，核物质和引导核物质爆炸的高性能炸药为海水所浸，并在短时间内溶解于水，沉淀在海底，将来不会发生爆炸，也不会对环境产生影响。
    此间舆论认为，美国政府虽然作了答复，日本外务省业已表示谅解，但事关日本的“无核三原则”，日本国内还有可能引起争论。
