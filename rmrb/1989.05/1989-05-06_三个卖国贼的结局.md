	The fate of three traitors
	Seventy years ago, on May 4th, Peking University students burned down the residence of Cao Rulin at Zhao Jia Lou. The traitors Cao Rulin, Zhang Zongxiang, and Lu Zongyu fled. Under public pressure, the Beiyang warlord government at the time dismissed the Minister of Communications Cao Rulin, the Ambassador to Japan Zhang Zongxiang, and the Director of the Mint Lu Zongyu from their posts.

	The news reached Haining, Zhejiang (Lu Zongyu was a native of Haining), and the entire city was in an uproar. A citizens' meeting was held, and it was decided to erect a stone monument to shame the traitors. On the spot, the citizens voluntarily donated funds, and craftsmen were hurriedly commissioned to work on the stone. The stone monument was over five feet long, inscribed with "Traitor Lu Zongyu" and "Year 8 of the Republic" and other characters. After that, this man never again appeared on the political stage, hiding in the concessions and living the life of a retired official. In his later years, he was superstitious and practiced planchette writing. He eventually died of pneumonia in Beijing in 1941.

	Zhang Zongxiang lived a bit longer. Since he had no new crimes, after liberation, he still resided in Shanghai, sometimes providing historical materials from his personal experiences before and after the May Fourth Movement (manuscript of "Taskless Reminiscences," unpublished). He died of illness in Shanghai in 1962.

	The most dramatic fate was that of Cao Rulin. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as the "highest advisor" of the puppet government in North China. After the war, the Kuomintang government arrested him along with a group of traitors. However, later, Chiang Kai-shek personally issued an order to release him. On the eve of liberation, Cao Rulin fled to Hong Kong and later moved to Japan. Under the protection of his mentor, then Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, and the war criminal Okamura Yasuji, he lived a parasitic life for eight years. With Yoshida's downfall, he had to flee to the United States. In 1964, at the age of 89, Cao Rulin, at the invitation of a small newspaper in Hong Kong, wrote "Memoirs of a Lifetime," trying to exonerate himself from the charge of treason. He died in a foreign land in 1966.

　　三个卖国贼的结局
    ７０年前的５月４日，北大学生火烧赵家楼曹宅时，卖国贼曹汝霖、章宗祥、陆宗舆跑掉了。迫于民愤，当时的北洋军阀政府把交通总长曹汝霖、驻日公使章宗祥、制币局总裁陆宗舆撤了职。
    消息传到浙江海宁（陆宗舆是海宁人），全城踊跃，开了个公民大会，并议决为卖国贼竖碑勒石。当场由民众自动捐资，叫工匠赶紧加工。石碑５尺余长，上刻“卖国贼陆宗舆”和“民国八年六月”等字。其后，此公再没有在政治舞台露面了，躲进租界过着寓公生活。晚年，迷信扶乩，最后于１９４１年闹肺炎死于北京。
    章宗祥则活得稍长。因没有新的罪行，解放后还在上海安居，有时还提供些他在五四前后亲身经历的史料（《任阙斋回忆录》稿本，没刊印），１９６２年病死于上海。
    最富戏剧色彩的要数曹汝霖了。抗日战争年代，此公曾出任华北敌伪政权的“最高顾问。”抗战胜利，国民党政府曾把他及一班敌伪汉奸头子一并抓了起来。只是后来蒋介石亲自下了手令，将其释放。解放前夕，曹汝霖逃亡香港，后移居日本。在他的恩师、当时日本首相吉田茂和大战犯冈村宁茨的卵翼下，过了８年寄生生活。随着吉田倒台，他不得不又流亡到了美国。到１９６４年，已届８９岁的曹汝霖，应香港某小报之约，居然还写什么《一生之回忆》，极力为己洗脱卖国之罪名，１９６６年客死他乡。
