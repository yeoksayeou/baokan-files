People's Daily, Mexico City, May 23rd. Reporter Guo Weicheng reports: A rare astronomical phenomenon occurred in the central Mexican city of Guadalajara today: the sun moved directly overhead, and all things cast no shadow.

At 12:50 PM today, residents of Guadalajara were astonished to discover that the sun was directly overhead, perpendicular to the surface of the earth. Consequently, all people, trees, buildings, and other objects on the ground lost their usual shadows. This phenomenon typically occurs only in equatorial countries, yet Guadalajara is located at approximately 21 degrees north latitude. This event has attracted the attention and study of local astronomers.

　　日行当空　万物无影
    墨西哥出现天文奇观
    本报墨西哥城５月２３日电  记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥中部城市瓜达拉哈拉今天出现罕见的天文奇观：日行当空，万物无影。
    今天中午１２时５０分，瓜达拉哈拉人惊奇地发现，太阳直射头顶，正好与地表物体垂直。因此，地面上所有的人、树木、建筑物等等全部失去了往常不离的影子。这种现象一般只会出现在赤道国家，而瓜达拉哈拉地处北纬２１度左右。这一现象引起了当地天文学者的注意与研究。
