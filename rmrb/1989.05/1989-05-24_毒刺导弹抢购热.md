The rush to buy Stinger missiles

By Ren Yujun, People's Daily reporter

Just as the Falklands War made the Exocet missile famous, the war in Afghanistan has greatly increased the value of the Stinger missile. Now, the American company General Dynamics, which produces the Stinger missile, has made a fortune. Orders are pouring in from Britain, West Germany, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other countries. On the weapons black market near the Afghan border, the Stinger missile has become the most sought-after item. Recently, it is said that 200 Stinger missiles have disappeared from the weapons depot of the Seven Party Alliance guerrillas. Many countries' intelligence agencies, weapons manufacturers, and even the Irish Republican Army in Britain, the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, and Sikh armed groups in India have all rushed to Afghanistan, attempting to buy these Stinger missiles from the black market.

The Stinger missile is a "star product" developed by General Dynamics in the early 1980s. It is a shoulder-launched short-range anti-aircraft missile. Although its maximum range is less than 6,000 meters and its effective range is only 4,800 meters, it uses infrared guidance. Once it locks onto a target, it can track the heat trail from the aircraft's exhaust and attack the enemy aircraft from all directions, making it highly accurate. Additionally, the missile is only 1.5 meters long and weighs just 15 kilograms, making it easy for one person to carry. If an enemy aircraft is spotted, the shooter can place the launch tube on their shoulder and use a sighting scope to fire.

Because the United States provided a significant number of Stinger missiles to the Afghan guerrillas, Soviet and Afghan pilots were terrified. According to statistics from Western sources, in just one year from 1986 to 1987, Stinger missiles shot down more than 300 Soviet aircraft in Afghanistan, valued at approximately $2.5 billion, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of crew members. In the martyrs' cemetery on the outskirts of Kabul, there is a special section for the crew members of aircraft shot down by Stinger missiles, which people call the "Stinger Missile Victims' Cemetery."

After the Soviet Union completely withdrew from Afghanistan, the Stinger missile had fewer opportunities to be used. The United States, fearing that some countries might obtain the Stinger missiles and master their production technology, and fearing that this aircraft killer might fall into the hands of terrorists and be aimed at Western civilian aircraft, has repeatedly negotiated with the leaders of the Afghan guerrillas. They either buy back the surplus Stinger missiles at a discounted price or exchange them for other weapons or equipment. Just as this matter was making no progress, news suddenly broke that 200 Stinger missiles had gone missing from the guerrilla weapons depot. This news has attracted widespread attention, and all sorts of arms dealers have flocked to the scene like flies to a carcass. Indeed, it is worrying to think about who might end up with these advanced weapons.

　　毒刺导弹抢购热
    本报记者  任毓骏
    正如英阿马岛之战使飞鱼导弹名扬天下一样，阿富汗战争也使毒刺导弹身价倍增。如今，生产毒刺导弹的美国通用动力公司已发了大财，来自英国、西德、以色列、沙特等国的订购单源源不绝；在阿富汗边境的武器走私市场上，毒刺导弹成了第一号抢手货。特别是近日来据说２００枚毒刺导弹从七党联盟游击队的武器库中不翼而飞，许多国家的情报部门、武器制造商，甚至还有英国的爱尔兰共和军、斯里兰卡的猛虎组织、印度的锡克族武装分子都纷纷赶赴阿富汗，企图从武器走私市场抢购这些毒刺导弹。
    毒刺导弹是美国通用动力公司８０年代初研制成功的“拳头”产品，是一种肩射式短程防空导弹，虽然其最大射程不足６０００米，有效射程只有４８００米，但由于它采用了红外线制导，一旦发现目标，就可跟踪飞机尾部排出的热气流，对敌机进行全方位攻击，所以命中率很高。又由于这种导弹只有１．５米长，重量仅１５公斤，１人即可携带。如若发现敌机，射手把发射筒扛在肩上，利用目测瞄准镜即可发射。
    由于美国向阿富汗游击队提供相当数量的毒刺导弹，曾使苏联和阿富汗飞行员胆战心惊。据西方有关部门统计，仅１９８６—１９８７年一年时间里，毒刺导弹在阿富汗共击毁苏联飞机３００多架，价值约２５亿美元，机上人员共有数百名丧生。在阿富汗首都喀布尔郊区的烈士墓地中，有一块墓地专葬被毒刺导弹击落的飞机机上人员，人们把这块墓地叫作“毒刺导弹牺牲品墓地”。
    苏联从阿富汗完全撤军后，毒刺导弹在阿富汗的用武之地大为减少。美国一怕某些国家得到毒刺导弹并掌握了其制造技术，二怕这种飞机的克星落入恐怖分子手中，把茅头对准西方的民航客机，所以多次和阿富汗游击队领导人协商，或以优惠价格把他们手中多余的毒刺导弹买回，或用其他武器或设备换回。就在此事未获进展之际，忽然传闻游击队武器库中的２００枚毒刺导弹失踪。这一消息引起了各方关注，形形色色的武器贩子也像苍蝇闻到血腥味一样赶来。这些尖端武器落入谁手，确实令人担忧。
