The fragrant litchi blossoms of March mark the busy sugarcane harvest season in the rural areas of Hainan. In Meian Town, Qiongzhou County, the crisscrossing rural roads are bustling with trucks and tractors loaded with sugarcane, shuttling between the cane fields and the sugar mills.

In 1988, Meian Town made headlines, surpassing historical records in eight economic indicators: sugarcane planting area, industrial output, oil crops, livestock, fisheries, fiscal revenue, tax revenue, total industrial and agricultural output, and per capita income.

Meian Town has a population of over 9,600 people. The land structure is "one part water, two parts fields, three parts mountains, and four parts slopes." For decades, the town relied solely on grain cultivation, resulting in low yields and meager incomes. After implementing the household contract responsibility system in 1984, the people of Meian finally found a path to prosperity. Cultivating sugarcane proved to be a sweet business, uncovering a wealth of resources in the land-scarce, water-deficient fields. Last year, the town planted 14,000 mu of sugarcane, producing 58,000 tons and generating 42 million yuan in revenue, accounting for 75% of the town's total industrial and agricultural output.

"For individual farmers, how sweet has sugarcane been?" I asked the town mayor, Huang Jian. He smiled, "Last year, sugarcane alone brought in an average income of 600 yuan per person, accounting for 75% of the total income. You should know that in 1978, the average income per person in Meian Town was only 48 yuan! Last year, the town's average income per person reached 805 yuan."

Adapting to local conditions has helped them find their geographical advantages, but scientific and technological knowledge is also essential. Xian Guanping introduced their "Sugarcane Association" to me. This "down-to-earth" association is composed of local officials, technicians, and specialized households. They hold two on-site meetings each year to popularize and promote scientific and technological advancements in cultivation and field management, as well as to train technical personnel.

Meian Town's sugarcane wealth has not neglected grain production. Last year, the town's early and late rice harvests not only exceeded the annual state procurement quota (55,000 kilograms, completed 75,000 kilograms) but also sold an additional 50,000 kilograms of above-quota grain to the state.

　　甜蜜的美安镇
    本报记者  罗自苏
    荔枝花流香的三月，海南农村收蔗正忙。琼山县美安镇纵横交错的乡间小路上，满载甘蔗的汽车、拖拉机在蔗田与糖厂间穿梭。
    １９８８年，美安镇出尽风头，在糖蔗播种面积及工业产量、油料作物、畜牧、渔业、财政、税收、工农业总产值、人均收入等８项经济指标上超过历史最高水平。
    琼山县美安镇人口９６００多，土地结构是“一分水、二分田、三分山、四分坡”。过去的几十年间单一种植粮食，产量低，收入少。实行联产承包责任制以后，到１９８４年，美安人才摸到一条致富之道。种甘蔗可真算甜蜜的事业，在土多田少缺水的田野里挖到了财源。去年全镇种蔗１．４万亩，总产５．８万吨，收入４２０多万元，占全镇工农业总产值的７５％。
    “就农民个人来讲，在甘蔗上尝到了多少甜头？”我问镇长黄坚。他笑了，“去年单甘蔗一项每人平均收入６００元，占总收入的７５％。要知道，１９７８年美安镇每人平均收入才４８元呵！去年，全镇每人平均收入达８０５元。”
    因地制宜算是找到了自己的地理优势，没有科学技术也不行。冼冠平向我介绍了他们的“甘蔗协会”。这个“土里土气”的协会，由镇上的干部、技术员和专业大户组成，每年搞两次现场会，在种植和田间管理上普及推广科学技术和培训技术人才。
    美安镇甘蔗致富却也没丢粮食生产。去年全镇早造一造不仅超额完成了全年的公购粮（任务５．５万公斤，完成７．５万公斤），还给国家多售议价粮５万公斤。
