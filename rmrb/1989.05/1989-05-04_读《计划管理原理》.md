How to strengthen and improve macro planning management in the new situation is not only an urgent task but also a major issue that needs to be re-examined and studied in depth. The book "Principles of Planning Management" edited by Comrade Zhong Qifei has made a valuable exploration in this regard and has recently been published by Liaoning University Press.

Unlike previous textbooks on planning management or planned economy, which were based on a highly centralized direct planning management system, this book attempts to use the theory of planned commodity economy and the theory of the primary stage of socialism as its basic foundation. It expounds the basic principles of China's macro planning management and explores the optimal combination of planned regulation and market regulation.

Firstly, the book provides a relatively accurate and comprehensive summary of the nature and forms of planning management under the planned commodity economy system. It objectively summarizes the traditional planning system in China as a highly centralized direct planning management system characterized by administrative measures and mandatory planning, and distinguishes it from the product-type planned economy envisioned by Marx and Engels, rather than vaguely referring to it as a product-type planned economy or product economy. At the same time, it provides a historical analysis of the conditions and reasons for the formation of the traditional planning system. The book argues that since it is acknowledged that the socialist economy is a planned commodity economy based on public ownership, it must be recognized that both planning and commodity attributes are inherent properties of the socialist economy. If only the planning attribute is considered, it is not inappropriate to define the socialist planned economy as a commodity-type planned economy. Accordingly, the planning management system should be a combination of indirect and direct planning management, with the former being the primary form. The distinction between "direct" and "indirect" here refers to whether the state's planning management of economic activities is realized through any intermediaries. Indirect planning management is the state's planning regulation and control of economic activities, which primarily relies on the regulatory role of economic policies, economic measures, and market mechanisms, rather than directly issuing mandatory indicators with administrative coercive force. It is not about bypassing the market but rather guiding, regulating, and adjusting microeconomic activities to meet macroeconomic objectives through market management, participation, and regulation.

Secondly, the book provides a relatively comprehensive and systematic discussion of the characteristics, functions, and limitations of various macro-regulatory measures, avoiding bias and one-sidedness. It also provides a very sober analysis of the relationships between centralization and decentralization, direct control and indirect control, economic measures and administrative measures, material incentives and ideological and political education, etc. This has some reference value for correctly understanding the current efforts to rectify the economic environment and order, and for comprehensively using economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and ideological and political work measures to conduct macro-control.

Thirdly, the book, based on China's national conditions, emphasizes the issue of hierarchical decision-making in planning management and expounds the basic principles of planning management in various regions (including provincial, municipal, and county planning management). This is a breakthrough from the traditional planning management system that focuses on departmental planning.

In addition, the book discusses important issues such as how to plan the regulation of commodity circulation, the relationship between price reform and planning management, and the comprehensive balance of fiscal and credit policies and their role in macro-control, while also proposing some relatively novel views and suggestions.

Perhaps because the book is written as a textbook, it focuses on systematically and concisely expounding the basic principles and foundational knowledge of planning management. Therefore, it does not delve deeper into some important issues, which is a shortcoming felt while reading the book.

　　读《计划管理原理》
    吴树青
    怎样在新形势下加强和改善宏观计划管理，不仅是当务之急，而且也是有必要重新认识并进行认真深入研究的重大课题。由钟契夫同志主编的《计划管理原理》一书，对此做了可贵的探索，该书最近已由辽宁大学出版社出版。
    与以前出版的计划管理学或计划经济学教材以高度集中型的直接计划管理体制为背景展开论述有所不同，该书力图以有计划商品经济理论和社会主义初级阶段理论为基本依据，阐述我国宏观计划管理的基本原理，探索计划调节和市场调节最优结合的途径。
    首先，该书对有计划商品经济体制下的计划管理的性质和形式，作了比较确切和比较全面的概括。对我国传统的计划体制，是从它的实际体现出发，实事求是地概括为以行政手段和指令性为特征的高度集中型直接计划管理体制，并将它与马、恩所设想的产品型计划经济作了区分，而不是笼统地称之为产品型计划经济或产品经济。同时，对传统计划体制形成的条件和原因作了历史的分析。书中认为，既然确认社会主义经济是建立在公有制基础上的有计划的商品经济，就必须承认计划性和商品性都同是社会主义经济这个统一体的属性。如果仅就计划性而言，未尝不可把社会主义计划经济定义为商品型计划经济。与此相适应的计划管理体制，应是以间接计划管理和直接计划管理相结合而以前者为主的形式。所谓“直接”和“间接”的区分这里是指国家对经济活动的计划管理是否经过任何的中介来实现。间接计划管理，是国家计划对经济活动的调节和控制，主要不是依靠直接下达具有行政强制性约束力的指令性指标，而是主要依靠经济政策、经济手段和市场机制等中介的调节作用，特别是不是撇开市场，而是通过对市场的管理、参与和调节而达到引导、调节微观经济活动服从宏观经济目标的要求。
    其次，该书对各种宏观调节手段的特点、作用和各自的局限性，作了比较全面和系统的论述，力戒偏颇和片面性。对集中与分散的关系、直接控制与间接控制的关系、经济手段与行政手段的关系、物质利益刺激与思想政治教育的关系，等等，也作了很冷静的分析。这对正确理解我国当前整治经济环境和秩序，综合运用经济的、行政的、法律的、纪律的和思想政治工作的手段，五管齐下，进行宏观调控，具有一定的参考价值。
    再次，该书从中国的国情出发，突出了计划管理分层决策问题，阐述了若干地区经济计划管理（包括省、市、县的计划管理）的基本原理，这对历来以部门计划为主线的计划管理学体系是一个突破。
    此外，该书对怎样计划调节商品流通、价格改革与计划管理的关系、财政信贷综合平衡及其在宏观控制中的作用等重要问题，在阐述基本原理的同时也提出了一些比较新颖的观点和建议。
    可能由于该书是作为教材而编写的，偏重在系统而简约地阐述计划管理的基本原理和基础知识，因而在一些重要问题上未能作更深层次的发掘和分析，这是阅读该书感到的不足之处。
