Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 6th.

In the ongoing cleanup and rectification of privately-run schools in Beijing, 424 schools have been re-evaluated and granted the "Certificate for Private Schools." Meanwhile, 48 schools have been shut down due to issues such as unclear sponsoring entities, inadequate educational conditions, or financial mismanagement.

The 424 private schools currently operating in Beijing, established by democratic parties, social organizations, and individual citizens, offer over 100 different majors and have enrolled more than 100,000 students in the capital. Cumulatively, nearly 600,000 students have graduated from these institutions, forming a preliminary multi-type, multi-level, and multi-disciplinary private education system.

According to a responsible official from the Beijing Municipal Adult Education Bureau, utilizing private resources for education is a crucial channel for developing China's educational sector and cultivating talent for the Four Modernizations. The past few years have proven that schools run by democratic parties, social organizations, or individual citizens have indeed nurtured some outstanding talents. However, some schools have violated relevant regulations, resulting in poor educational quality and negative social impacts. The purpose of this rectification is to ensure the healthy development of privately-run schools and further improve educational quality.

　　北京市整顿社会办学    
    凡不合格者注销停办
    新华社北京５月６日电  （记者张宝瑞）在北京市目前开展的社会力量办学的清理整顿工作中，有４２４所学校经重新审核获得《社会力量办学证明》，４８所学校因为主办单位不明确、不具备办学条件或财务管理混乱等原因被注销停办。
    北京市现有的民主党派、社会团体和公民个人开办的４２４所学校，共设有１００多个专业，在京面授学员１０余万人，累计结业近６０万人次，已初步形成多类型、多层次、多学科的民办教育体系。
    据北京市成人教育局负责同志介绍，利用社会力量办学是发展我国教育事业，为四化建设培养人才的重要渠道之一，这几年的实践证明，由民主党派、社会团体或公民个人办学确实培养了一些优秀人才。但同时也有少数学校违反有关规定，办学质量差，在社会上产生了不好的影响。这次整顿工作的目的，就是使由社会力量办的学校能健康地发展，进一步提高教育质量。
