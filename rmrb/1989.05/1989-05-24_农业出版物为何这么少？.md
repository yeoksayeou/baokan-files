	Why Are There So Few Agricultural Publications?

	Editor:

	At a time when agriculture is increasingly in need of scientific and technological knowledge, agricultural science and technology publications are severely lacking. Taking San Yuan County in Shaanxi Province as an example, in 1987, the county's New China Bookstore received 27 issues of Shaanxi's book ordering catalogs, among which only 36 were agricultural books (including 13 reprints), accounting for 0.029% of Shaanxi's 1,238 book titles that year. From March to June 1988, the store received 12 issues of national book ordering catalogs, with 4,001 science and technology books listed, among which only 109 were agricultural science and technology books, accounting for 0.027% of the nation's new science and technology books.

	Do rural areas not need agricultural science and technology books? Consider this:

	In Xi Quan Township, Lin Tong County, Shaanxi Province, a 26-year-old high school graduate named Wang Jianrong, who sells agricultural science and technology books individually, purchased 15 titles and nearly 300 copies of books such as "Feeding Technology for Lean Pigs," "Mushroom Cultivation Technology," and "300 Questions on Fruit Trees" from publishers like Shaanxi Science and Technology Press at the beginning of this year. By setting up stalls at markets and visiting villages, he sold out all the books in less than half a month. In 1988, Lin Tong County's New China Bookstore had general book sales revenue of 9.9 million yuan, of which 5.2 million yuan was from sales to rural areas.

	Since rural areas need books, especially agricultural science and technology books, why are there so few books suitable for rural areas? I believe the main reasons are as follows:

	First, there are too few publishing houses that target rural areas. Currently, there are over 500 publishing houses nationwide, but only 8 of them target rural areas. Shaanxi Province has 15 publishing houses, but none of them specialize in rural reading materials (Shaanxi Science and Technology Press has an agricultural editing department with only 3 editors). Nationwide, only Henan Province has a "Zhongyuan Farmer Publishing House."

	Second, the pursuit of immediate profits in the publishing industry hinders the publication of rural books.

	Third, the guiding ideology of the authorities overseeing the publishing industry lacks the understanding that "agriculture is the foundation of the national economy" and that 80% of China's population lives in rural areas.

	To quickly change the situation of book scarcity in rural areas and to align with the Party and government's overall plan to develop agricultural production, I suggest: Each province and autonomous region should have a publishing house that targets rural areas and provide economic support. I propose that publishing authorities at all levels place the publication of rural reading materials on their agenda, formulate specific measures, and ensure that agricultural science and technology publications can meet the needs of rural development.

### 农业出版物为何这么少？

　　农业出版物为何这么少？
    编辑同志：
    在农业日益需要科技知识的今天，农业科技出版物却十分缺乏。以我们陕西省三原县为例，１９８７年，县新华书店收到陕版图书征订目录２７期，其中，农业书只有３６种（包括１３种重版），占陕西当年出书１２３８个品种的０．０２９％。１９８８年３—６月，该店收到全国图书征订目录１２期，征订的科技书有４００１种，其中，农业科技书只有１０９种，占全国新出科技书的０．０２７％。
    农村不需要农业科技书吗？请看：
    陕西省临潼县西泉乡麦王村农业科技书个体发行户，２６岁的高中毕业生王建荣，今年初从陕西科技出版社等批进了《瘦肉型猪的饲养技术》、《蘑菇栽培技术》、《果树３００题》等农业科技书共１５个品种近３００册，逢赶集摆摊、平时走村串户，不到半个月就销售一空。１９８８年临潼县新华书店发行一般图书收入９９万元，其中销售到农村的５２万元。
    农村既然需要书，尤其是农业科技书，那么，适合农村的书为啥那么少呢？我认为，原因主要有这样几条：
    一是以农村为对象的出版社太少了。现在，全国有５００多家出版社，而以农村为对象的只有８家。陕西省有１５家出版社，没有１家农村读物出版社（陕西科技出版社有一个仅３名编辑人员的农业编辑室）。全国省级只有河南省有一个“中原农民出版社”。
    二是出版界中的急功近利的思想妨害着农村图书的出版。
    三是出版事业的主管部门的指导思想中缺少“农业是国民经济的基础”和我国８０％人口是在农村这个极大的国情实际。
    为了尽快改变农村图书贫乏的现状，为了和党和政府发展农业生产的总格局合拍，我认为：每个省和自治区都应有以农村为对象的出版社，并在经济上给以支持。建议各级出版主管部门，把对农村读物的出版放在议事日程上，制定具体措施，使农业科技等农业出版物能适应农村发展的需要。
