Two essay contests related to architectural culture have recently concluded, shedding light on the urgent need to define architectural culture. Everyone wants a good home, but few people understand architecture from a cultural perspective. This outdated mindset hinders the improvement of China's architectural standards.

The winning essay "Starting from a Leader's Doubts" and others discussed a perplexing issue: even some leaders and architects in the construction department doubt the concept of "architectural culture," let alone the general public. In people's minds, building a house is merely constructing a shelter, and architects are seen as mere craftsmen. In the West, architecture is one of the three pillars of the national economy, but in China, it is placed at a very low position, making it impossible to discuss the high standards of architectural culture.

Due to a lack of understanding of architectural culture, it is difficult to create a unified and harmonious artificial environment. Short-term behavior and chaos are prevalent across China. The essay "Establishing a New Urban Consciousness" provided an example: a city built a high-rise building near a crossroads a few years ago, but now that a flyover is being constructed at the crossroads, the high-rise building worth millions of yuan has been demolished. Currently, we have not yet achieved the integration of residential buildings, public facilities, gardens, urban sculptures, and urban planning as a whole and placed them within the overall cultural background for examination and research. Due to this directionless random selection, our natural environment is often damaged. Essays like "Environmental Art and Cultural Background" expressed this deep concern.

When many citizens are still worried about housing, it seems difficult to consider the influence of architecture on people's psychology, consciousness, concepts, and behavior. This influence is precisely severe, deep-seated, and long-term. In Beijing, citizens voted for the top ten buildings, and a pseudo-antique building was surprisingly included. Essays like "How Can a Fake Be Selected?" sharply questioned this, not just about one building. From the 1950s to the 1980s, China experienced two waves of architectural revivalism, with both proponents and high evaluations. The essay "Traditional Patterns, Cultural Progress, and Architectural Development" analyzed that "the May Fourth Movement did not inject scientific and democratic consciousness into the deep structure of traditional culture," and "in today's urban architecture and architectural activities, the influence from the deep cultural structure is still very profound." As a result, the public mixes the outdated with the novel, old traditions with postmodernism, and non-art with art, creating and evaluating the bitter architecture of contemporary China together with architects.

Many essays not only discussed the cultural factors of architecture and the aesthetic significance of architecture but also included articles like "Modern Architecture in China" and "Comparing Family Architecture Layouts in China and the U.S. to Understand Cultural Differences." These essays explored how to discard traditions, pursue progress, and make Chinese architecture both nationally distinctive and rich in modern spirit through the historical evolution of Chinese architecture and the comparison between Chinese and Western architecture.

"The architectural industry in China needs to go global, but first, it must step out of the architectural circle and gain understanding and support from various sectors of Chinese society." This is the call from the architectural industry and also a societal demand. These two essay contests have promoted communication and exchange between the architectural industry and society.

### 两个有关建筑文化的征文活动展示  建筑文化的观念亟待确定

　　两个有关建筑文化的征文活动展示
    建筑文化的观念亟待确定
    本报北京５月２０日讯  记者朱碧森报道：谁都想占据一套好房，又很少有人从文化层次去认识建筑，观念的落后阻碍了我国建筑水平的提高。最近先后结束的“建筑·社会·文化”和“新文化与中国城市及建筑”两个征文活动，对这一状况进行了冲击。
    获奖作品《由一位领导的疑惑说起》等文，谈到了一个令人哭笑不得的问题，有的建筑部门的领导甚至建筑师，对“建筑文化”这一概念都持疑义，更何况一般人。在人们心目中，建房不过是造一个窝，建筑师等同于工匠，在西方作为国民经济三大支柱之一的建筑，在我国被摆到相当低的地位，便无从谈建筑文化的高品格。
    由于对建筑文化认识不足，也就无法创造风格统一和谐的人工环境。短期行为、杂乱无章等弊病，在中国大地上比比皆是。《树立新的城市意识》一文举了这样一个例子：有个城市早几年在十字街口旁造了座高楼，现在这十字街口要造立交桥，于是花了上百万元的高楼毁于一旦。目前我们“尚未做到把住宅、公共设施、园林、城市雕塑、城市规划等连接起来当作一个整体并将其放置于整个文化背景中去加以考察和研究。由于这种无定向的偶然选择，常常使我们的自然环境遭到破坏”——《环境艺术与文化背景》等文表达了这种深刻的忧患。
    当许多国民还在为住房发愁时，似乎确实难以考虑到建筑对人的心理、意识、观念、行为方式的影响，这种影响又恰恰是严重的、深层的、长期的。北京市民评选十大建筑，一座仿古建筑竟然也入选。《赝品怎能入选》等文尖锐的发问绝不是针对一座建筑的。从５０年代到８０年代，中国建筑的两次复古思潮，既有人提倡，也有人接受且给予很高评价。《传统模式、文化进程与建筑发展》一文分析说，“五四运动并没有把科学民主意识注入到传统文化意识的深层结构中去”，“在今天的城市建筑与建筑活动中，这种来自文化深层结构的影响依然十分深刻。”结果是，民众把陈腐与新奇、旧传统与后现代、非艺术与艺术混同，与建筑师们一起创造和品评了中国当代苦涩的建筑。
    不少征文不仅谈到了建筑的文化因素、建筑的美学意义，还有类似《现代建筑在中国》、《从中美家庭建筑格局看两国文化观念之差异》的文章，从中国建筑的历史演变、中西建筑的比较中，探讨了如何扬弃传统，追求进步，使中国建筑既具有民族特色，又富于现代精神。
    “中国建筑要走向世界，首先要走出建筑界，得到国内社会各界的理解和支持才行。”这是建筑界的呼声，也是社会的要求，这两次征文活动可以说促进了建筑界与社会的沟通、交流。
