    Juvenile crime is on the rise in China, prompting the establishment of special juvenile criminal courts. Currently, there are over 400 such courts nationwide. This is an innovative reform in the criminal justice system.

    It is understood that juvenile crime has been increasing year by year. Last year, approximately 20,000 juveniles were involved in criminal activities, accounting for 8.9% of the total crime rate. The establishment of specialized courts to handle juvenile criminal cases is a necessary measure to curb this trend.

    A relevant official from the Supreme People's Court revealed that these courts are predominantly staffed by female judges and often include appropriate people's assessors in the judicial process. Local courts have specially invited teachers, women's federation members, and youth league cadres who love, understand, and are familiar with juveniles to serve as assessors. This allows them to leverage their understanding of juvenile psychology and provide individualized guidance.

    It is reported that since 1984, the Changning District People's Court in Shanghai has handled 45 criminal cases involving juveniles. The court has focused on investigating the causes of the crimes, providing guidance and education, working with the juveniles' families, balancing punishment with leniency, and conducting follow-up visits. As a result, the efforts have been notably effective. Over the past four years, only one of the 45 juveniles has reoffended.

### 未成年人犯罪逐年增多  少刑案合议庭应运而生

　　未成年人犯罪逐年增多    
    少刑案合议庭应运而生
    本报北京５月９日讯  记者毛磊报道：我国审判制度又有一项新的建设：建立少年刑事案件合议庭。目前，全国已有这种合议庭４００多个。这是刑事审判工作的一个改革性尝试。
    据了解，我国未成年人犯罪逐年增多，去年未成年人犯罪约２万人，占犯罪总人数的８．９％。建立专门审理未成年人刑事案件的少年刑案合议庭是减少未成年人犯罪的需要。
    最高人民法院有关负责人透露，这类合议庭多由女法官从事审判，并邀请适当的人民陪审员参加审判。各地法院特邀了一些热爱少年、熟悉少年、理解少年的学校教师、妇联或共青团干部担任陪审员，以便发挥他们了解少年思想变化、因人施教的作用。
    据了解，上海长宁区人民法院自１９８４年以来共审理了４５名未成年人的刑事案件，该院在审理中，由于注重查清犯罪原因，注重启发疏导，注重做好家长工作，注重惩办与宽大相结合、注重回访考察，因而收效显著。四年来，上述４５名少年中，重新违法犯罪的只有一人。
