Everyone knows that Dali's Cangshan and Erhai are beautiful. Cangshan has nineteen peaks, each one finely sculpted like jade lotuses; eighteen streams of water splash and flow into the emerald-green Erhai Lake. Erhai, the second-largest lake in Yunnan, is a scenic highland lake with clear water and abundant fish and shrimp. Cangshan is high, and Erhai is vast. The "four wonders"—wind, flowers, snow, and moon—have adorned Cangshan and Erhai for a thousand years.

However, when the reporter visited today, he heard a deep, urgent call from Cangshan and Erhai.

Cangshan says: Give me back my green trees

I saw a worrying figure: the forest coverage rate between Cangshan and Erhai is only 11.4%, and it has lost the ability to regenerate and flourish on its own. Boating on Erhai, looking around, the eastern side of Erhai is a barren mountain, devoid of trees, let alone grass; gazing at Cangshan, the forest line has retreated to an altitude of over 2,500 meters, only remaining in the middle of the mountain.

I know that the felling of Cangshan's forests began in the Tang and Song dynasties. The first large-scale felling occurred during the Ming and Qing dynasties, the second during the Anti-Japanese War, but the third occurred between 1958 and 1976. Now, the eighteen streams of Cangshan have dried up during the dry season! Without the forest's retention, 1.27 million cubic meters of silt are washed into Erhai each year, raising the lake bed. The more serious problem is that the upstream water source areas of Erhai, including Luoping Mountain, Biaoshan, and Dabeishan, covering an area of 2,565 square kilometers, have been even more severely deforested. If this continues, Cangshan will no longer be green. How can Cangshan not cry out?

Erhai says: Leave me with clear water

Do not assume that Erhai, with a water storage capacity of nearly 3 billion cubic meters, has an inexhaustible supply of water. According to observations by the Dali Hydrological Station, before the 1970s, Erhai's average inflow was 800 million cubic meters, which decreased to 700 million cubic meters in the 1970s, and in the early 1980s, due to consecutive droughts, the inflow dropped to less than 500 million cubic meters. In 1982, the inflow was only 157 million cubic meters. What about water usage? Between 1980 and 1988, three cascading hydropower stations were built at the downstream outlet of Erhai, with a total installed capacity of 255,000 kilowatts, requiring 700 million cubic meters of water per year for power generation alone. Adding industrial, agricultural, and domestic water usage of 200 million cubic meters, the total demand reaches 900 million cubic meters. The annual deficit between inflow and usage is 200 to 300 million cubic meters, depleting the reservoir capacity year by year.

Erhai's water level has dropped by 3 meters to an elevation of 1,970 meters. As a result, Erhai's water surface has shrunk by 11 square kilometers, causing 52 agricultural irrigation pump stations along the lake to be suspended, unable to pump water. The shallow water areas of the lake are becoming marshy, and the native fish species are losing their spawning grounds and gradually disappearing.

The most prominent potential problem is that the design elevation for the Xier River Hydropower Station was 1,969 meters. If the water level really drops to this level, large areas of the lake bed will be exposed.

A question mark hangs over Cangshan and Erhai

The plight of Cangshan and Erhai has finally awakened the Dali people of various ethnic groups. People have realized the necessity of controlling Erhai's lowest water level. After comprehensive discussions, experts and scholars have proposed their views on the lowest control water level for Erhai. Since 1984, the Dali Prefecture has been drafting the "Erhai Management Regulations," which were finalized after four years and approved by the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, coming into effect on March 1, 1989.

As a local regulation, this regulation stipulates: "Erhai's lowest operating water level is 1,971 meters, and the highest water storage level is 1,974 meters. All development activities must be strictly controlled within this normal water level range." With the regulation in place, Erhai should be able to breathe a sigh of relief.

However, the problem is not that simple. Dali experienced an unprecedented spring, summer, and autumn drought last year, and Erhai's water storage was severely insufficient. This year, the spring drought continues, and Erhai's water level has dropped to the legal minimum. Currently, the entire province of Yunnan is facing an extreme power shortage, and all parties are demanding that the Xier River Hydropower Station generate more electricity. To generate electricity, the water level must be lowered, creating a difficult dilemma.

In this dilemma, it seems that the protection of Erhai should take a step back. On March 21, the prefectural government submitted a proposal to the People's Congress, requesting "in this year's special difficult situation, to allow the flexible implementation of the 'Erhai Management Regulations'..." and to lower the "lowest water level" by another 30 centimeters. A few days later, the People's Congress passed the proposal to "flexibly implement" the regulations by a narrow majority.

Erhai's water level has broken the legal minimum line, and another circle of damp lake bed has appeared at the edge of Erhai. The members of the prefectural People's Congress feel embarrassed...

Today, Erhai is still clear and beautiful, but what if people do not protect it? The reporter suddenly realized that the crescent-shaped Erhai truly resembles a large, green question mark.

　　苍山洱海的困窘
    本报记者  钱江
    谁都知道大理的苍山洱海美。苍山十九峰，峰峰巧削玉芙蓉；十八条溪水飞珠溅玉，奔泻进碧绿色的洱海。云南第二大湖洱海是风光明媚的高原湖泊，水质清澈，盛产鱼虾。苍山高，洱海阔，风、花、雪、月“四绝”附丽于苍山洱海已千年。
    然而今天记者到此，却听到苍山洱海一声接一声深沉的呼唤。
    苍山说：请还我绿色的树
    我看到一个令人忧虑的数字，苍山洱海之间，森林覆盖率仅为１１．４％，已经失去了自我更新繁茂的能力。泛舟洱海，举目四望，洱海东侧是荒山秃岭，不要说树，就连草也很少；眺望苍山，森林线已退到海拔２５００米以上，仅存于山腰一带。
    我知道，对苍山森林的砍伐从唐宋时就开始了。明清时期是第一次大砍伐，抗战时是第二次，但第三次却在１９５８—１９７６年之间。如今的苍山十八溪在旱季已经断流！没有了森林的涵养，每年的雨水将１２７万方泥沙冲进洱海，壅高湖底。严峻的问题还在于，洱海上游水源地区的罗坪山、标山、大黑山等径流面积２５６５平方公里范围内，林木砍伐得更严重。如此下去，苍山将不是绿色的。苍山哪能不呼喊呢？
    洱海说：请留给我清澈的水
    切不要以为蓄水量近３０亿立方的洱海水用之不竭。据大理水文站观测，７０年代前洱海平均来水量８亿方，７０年代减为７亿方，８０年代初连年干旱，来水量降到５亿方以下。其中１９８２年来水量仅１．５７亿方。用水量呢？１９８０—１９８８年间，洱海下游出水口上建成了３个梯级水电站，装机容量２５．５万千瓦，单发电每年需用７亿方水。再加上工农业和生活用水２亿方，需求总量达９亿方。进水和用水每年逆差２—３亿方，连年挖库容。
    洱海水位连降３米到了海拔高程１９７０米。洱海水面因此缩小了１１平方公里，造成沿湖５２个农灌水泵站悬空，无法抽水。沿湖水域变浅了，水草在向湖心蔓延。浅水区呈现出沼泽化状态，加上来水河口的变化，洱海土著鱼种失去了产卵场，逐渐消亡。
    最突出的潜在问题是，当年建造西洱河电站是以１９６９米来设计取水的，如果真的这样，还将有大块湖底裸露出来。
    “？”号，留在苍山洱海间
    苍山洱海的窘迫终于唤起了大理各族人民的警觉。人们认识到了控制洱海最低水位的必要性。有关专家学者经综合论证，提出了对洱海最低控制水位线的看法。从１９８４年起，大理州《洱海管理条例》着手拟订，历经４年后定稿，经云南省人大常委会批准，自１９８９年３月１日起施行。
    作为地方法规的这个条例规定：洱海“最低运行水位为１９７１米，最高蓄水位为１９７４米。一切开发活动必须严格控制在此正常水位范围内进行。”法规一出，洱海该喘一口气了。
    问题偏偏没有那么简单。大理去年遇上了罕见的春夏秋连续干旱，洱海蓄水严重不足，今年又是春旱，洱海水位已降至法定最低点。眼下云南全省电力极度紧张，各方面都要求西洱河电站多发电。要发电就得降低水位，真是左右为难。
    两难之中，似乎洱海保护就当退后一步了。３月２１日，州政府向州人大提出议案，“请求在今年这样特殊困难的情况下，允许变通执行《洱海管理条例》……”将“最低水位”再降低３０厘米。几天后，人大会议以微弱多数通过了请求“变通”的议案。
    洱海水位突破了法定最低线，洱海边又多出一圈犹带潮湿的湖底。州人大委员感到困窘……
    今天的洱海还是清澈美丽的，若是人们不保护它呢？记者突然发现，弯环似的洱海真像一个碧绿的大“？”号。
