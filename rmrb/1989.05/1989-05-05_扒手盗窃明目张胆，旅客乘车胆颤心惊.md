Pickpockets Brazenly Steal, Passengers Ride in Fear

On the evening of March 14, at 7 PM, I boarded the 504th train at Jixi Station. Around 1 AM, after the train passed Mudanjiang, I was dozing off and felt someone unbuttoning my coat. I opened my eyes and saw a young man swaying in front of me. He then walked away nonchalantly. I felt my coat pocket and found that 4 yuan was missing.

After losing the money, I didn't dare to sleep again. The train passed Acheng, and it was daylight. There were more people on the train, and I hadn't slept all night, feeling very tired. Unknowingly, I fell asleep again. About half an hour later, I woke up and felt my inner coat pocket; 100 yuan was gone. I searched everywhere, and an elderly man sitting opposite me said, "Don't look for it. Someone took it." A female passenger next to me said, "The person who stole your money wasn't alone. One sat at the tea table, one stood by your side, and there might be more of them behind. We all saw you lose your money, but we didn't dare to speak up." The elderly man added, "On this train, losing money is common. If you don't get beaten up, you're lucky."

People say that on the 501/502 trains from Sanjiazi to Dongfanghong and the 503/504 trains from Sanjiazi to Mishan, pickpockets operate in gangs, brazenly stealing, and passengers have no sense of security. I experienced it firsthand, but why are pickpockets so rampant on the trains, even to the point where passengers dare not speak up?

　　扒手盗窃明目张胆，旅客乘车胆颤心惊
    ３月１４日晚１９时，我在鸡西站登上了５０４次列车，深夜１时，列车刚过牡丹江，我正在打盹，觉着有人在解我的上衣扣，一睁眼，见一青年男子在我面前晃了一下。便大摇大摆地走了。我一摸上衣兜，发现丢了４元钱。
    丢钱后，我没敢再睡。列车过了阿城，天亮了，车上的人多了，我一夜未合眼感到非常疲倦，不知不觉地又睡着了。约莫半小时的功夫，我醒了，一摸上衣的里兜，１００元钱不见了，我四处寻找，坐在对面的一位老者说：“别找了，让人家拿走了。”旁边一名女同志说：“偷你钱的不是一个人，一个坐在茶桌上，一个站在你旁边，后面可能还有他们的人，你丢钱我们都看见了，没敢吱声。”老者又说：“在这趟车上丢钱是常事，没挨一顿打就算便宜。”
    人们说：在三棵树至东方红的５０１／５０２次列车和三棵树至密山的５０３／５０４次列车上，扒手成帮结伙，明目张胆行窃，旅客没有一点安全感。我算是领略到了，但为什么列车上扒手这样猖狂，甚至乘客见了也不敢吱声？
