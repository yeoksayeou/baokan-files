Guangdong Strictly Investigates Cases of Prosecutorial Officers Breaking the Law

    XIAO Yang Believes that Anti-Corruption Efforts Should Be a Major Priority

    Our reporter learned that in recent years, there have been instances of abuse of power and corruption within the Guangdong Provincial Prosecutor's Office. According to incomplete statistics, over the past seven years, 169 prosecutorial officers in the province have been disciplined for violating laws and regulations. Among them, 24 were arrested, sentenced, or sent to labor camps, and 39 were expelled from the Party, the Communist Youth League, or their public positions. Some of these cases were particularly serious. Although these incidents involved only a small number of individuals, they have tarnished the image of the prosecutor's office in the eyes of the people.

    XIAO Yang pointed out that the prosecutor's office cannot overlook anti-corruption work just because these are isolated incidents. Instead, it should take strong measures to eradicate these corrupt practices. In this sense, the issue of corruption within the prosecutor's office is not a minor one, nor is it an example of "making a mountain out of a molehill." Rather, it is a major issue that affects the whole and should be treated as such.

　　粤严查检察干警违法案    
    肖扬认为廉政建设应该大题大作
    本报讯  广东省人民检察院检察长肖扬日前透露，这些年，广东省检察机关内部徇私枉法、以权谋私等违法乱纪现象时有发生。据不完全统计，近７年来，全省检察干警违法乱纪受处分的人数达１６９人，其中被逮捕、判刑、劳教的就有２４人，开除党籍、开除团籍、开除公职的３９人，有的性质非常严重。这些行为尽管只是发生在极少数人身上，但却玷污了检察机关在人民群众中的形象。
    肖扬指出，检察机关不能因为这仅仅是极个别的现象而忽略了廉政工作，而应该采取强有力的措施，杜绝这些腐败现象。从这个意义上说，检察机关的廉政问题并非小问题，也不是“小题大作”，而是一个事关全局的大问题，应该是“大题大作”。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（刘桂明　詹高尔）
