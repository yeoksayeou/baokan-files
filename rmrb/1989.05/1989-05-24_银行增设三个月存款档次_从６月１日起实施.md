Banks Add Three-Month Deposit Tier
Implementing from June 1

NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY BEIJING, May 24 (Reporter Ding Jianming) The State Council has approved the People's Bank of China's decision to add a three-month deposit tier, which will be implemented starting June 1.

It is understood that currently, Chinese residents hold approximately 15 billion yuan in cash. The primary reasons for this cash being stagnant in society include severe inflation and unstable public sentiment. Additionally, the limited number of deposit tiers offered by banks, and the relatively long minimum term for fixed-term savings deposits, contribute to the inconvenience experienced by depositors.

Recently, the People's Bank of China has issued a notice requiring all specialized banks and post office savings institutions to open a three-month deposit tier for urban and rural residents, as well as for enterprises and institutions, starting June 1. The maximum interest rate for these deposits is set at 6.3% per month. The People's Bank of China's provincial, autonomous region, and municipal branches, as well as branches in planned cities and special economic zones, have the authority to determine specific interest rates based on local conditions, with the geographical and municipal levels as units. The People's Bank of China's headquarters also stipulates that the interest rates within the same region must be consistent to avoid market disruption due to inconsistent interest rates.

　　银行增设三个月存款档次
    从６月１日起实施
    新华社北京５月２４日电  （记者丁坚铭）经国务院批准，中国人民银行最近作出了增设３个月存款档次的决定，这一决定将于６月１日起实施。
    据了解，目前我国居民手中持有的现金已达到１５００亿元左右，这一部分现金滞留在社会上的主要原因，除了通货膨胀严重，居民心理不稳定以外，也与银行现有存款档次过少，定期储蓄存款最低档次的期限较长，储户感到不方便有关。
    据悉，中国人民银行最近已发出通知，要求各家专业银行及邮政部门办的储蓄机构，从６月１日起对城乡居民个人和企事业单位开设３个月的存款档次。存款利率最高限为月利率６．３％。人民银行各省、自治区、直辖市分行及计划单列市，经济特区分行，都有权根据当地情况，以地、市为单位，确定具体利率水平。中国人民银行总行同时还要求同一地区的利率水平必须一致，以避免由于利率不统一而扰乱金融市场。
