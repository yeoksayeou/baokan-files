With the help of several Chinese scholars, I had the opportunity to meet Professor Bert Bolin of Stockholm University. Not long ago, he received the highest honor in the field of environmental science, the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, and enjoys a very high reputation in the international meteorological community.

“Over the past ten years, there have been many unusual climate changes. What causes these phenomena? Are human activities altering the Earth's climate?”

The conversation began with Professor Bolin’s long-term research topics. He has conducted extensive research on how human activities since the Industrial Revolution have increased the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and is regarded as one of the pioneers in the study of global climate change.

He said: “The temperature of the entire Earth’s surface is gradually rising, and this trend is continuing. The current average annual temperature is 0.67 degrees Celsius higher than it was a hundred years ago. Some regions have experienced extreme cold, extreme heat, and severe droughts. Part of the reason for these phenomena may be internal oscillations in the atmosphere, but they are definitely linked to human activities. A clear fact is that the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is increasing rapidly, at least 90% of which comes from human activities. This includes deforestation in many regions and the uncontrolled use of fossil fuels. The concentrations of methane, chlorofluorocarbons, and sulfur in the atmosphere are also increasing. As for whether the increase in carbon dioxide will cause the greenhouse effect and how much human activities affect the climate environment, there are many disputes in the scientific community, and this remains to be scientifically verified. This is also the challenge facing research in the next ten years.”

After discussing issues such as acid rain pollution, land desertification, and ozone layer depletion, Professor Bolin slowed down and said word by word: “Regarding the environmental problems facing humanity, we must consider what we should and can do now, and what common strategies we should adopt. If we wait until the climate undergoes major changes before taking measures, it will be too late.”

Professor Bolin believes that environmental protection is no longer just an academic issue but a political one. For global environmental changes, experts from different countries and disciplines need to cooperate in research. Governments of various countries should give sufficient attention to this and adopt a cooperative attitude. They should make all of humanity understand the importance of environmental protection and think about the survival environment for future generations.

He advocates that developed countries and developing countries should strengthen cooperation on this issue. He agrees with the view that the industrial history of developed countries is much longer than that of developing countries, and they should bear more responsibility for environmental pollution. He believes that the efforts made by industrialized countries are still insufficient. Some countries, due to concerns about increased costs, are unwilling to use advanced technologies to reduce environmental pollution and are also unwilling to help developing countries address environmental issues. This is a very shortsighted view. At the same time, he emphasizes that developing countries should actively participate in international discussions and cooperative research, striving to cooperate with developed countries to solve the environmental problems they face. He has visited China twice and has had many interactions with the Chinese meteorological community. He believes that China has a group of very outstanding experts who should play a greater role in international cooperative research. He also points out that China's main problem is energy. China uses coal as its primary energy source, but the efficiency is very low. He sincerely says: “You need more energy, but in developing industry, you must strengthen control over air pollution and other aspects, including controlling the increase in carbon dioxide. This will require more funding, but in the long run, it will be beneficial to your economy.”

Since taking over as the director of the International Meteorological Institute at Stockholm University at the age of 32, Bolin has been actively promoting international cooperative research. In the mid-1960s, he served as the chairman of the International Council for Science's Commission on Atmospheric Sciences and made outstanding contributions to the interdisciplinary “Global Atmospheric Research Program.”

In the 1980s, as the chairman of the International Council for Science's special committee, he played a key role in the design and approval of the “International Geosphere-Biosphere Program.” He said: “This is a comprehensive research program involving 174 scientists from 37 countries. It aims to understand the changes in the Earth's environment where humans live, including natural and man-made changes, and to study the interactions between the geosphere and biosphere related to these changes. The research results will enhance our ability to predict major global changes that may occur in the future and provide a comprehensive scientific basis for the rational arrangement of Earth's resources. This is a strategic plan related to the future survival environment of humanity.” Professor Bolin specially pointed out that this plan has received active support from China.

Professor Bolin is a student of one of the founders of modern meteorology, Rossby. After Rossby's death in 1957, he took over the leadership of the Stockholm University Meteorological Institute. Although this reduced his time in the laboratory, he successfully conducted research on sounding rockets, interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean, and published more than a hundred scientific papers. Due to his outstanding contributions to meteorology and his efforts in promoting international meteorological cooperation, he has won many honors.

When I asked him to share his experiences in achieving such success in his career, he paused for a moment and said: “Cooperation with colleagues is crucial in research work. Few people in the world can become authorities in the scientific field solely through their own intelligence. A person's creativity can only be enriched and expressed in a harmonious and cooperative atmosphere. To win such an atmosphere, one must learn to be broad-minded and good at accepting various criticisms. This is the spirit advocated by my teacher Rossby. I also emphasize this to my students.”

### 为了人类的生存环境——访瑞典气象学家伯特·博林

　　为了人类的生存环境   
     ——访瑞典气象学家伯特·博林
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    在几位中国学者的帮助下，我有机会见到了斯德哥尔摩大学的伯特·博林教授。不久前，他刚获得环境学界的最高荣誉奖，泰勒环境成就奖，在国际气象学界享有很高的威望。
    “近１０年来出现了不少气候异常变化现象，这是什么原因造成的？人类的活动是否正在改变地球的气候环境？”
    谈话从博林教授长期从事的研究课题开始。他在确定工业革命以来人类活动如何增加了大气中二氧化碳浓度等方面做了大量研究，被誉为研究全球气候变化的先驱之一。
    他说：“整个地球表层的气温在逐步升高，这一趋势还在发展，目前的年平均气温比一百年前提高了０．６７摄氏度。一些地区出现了奇冷、奇热及严重干旱等现象。产生这些现象的部分原因可能是大气内部的环流振动，但是同人类的活动肯定是有联系的。一个明显的事实是，大气中的二氧化碳正在大量增加，至少９０％来自人类的活动，其中包括许多地区出现的滥伐树木，以及毫无节制地使用矿物燃料。大气中甲烷、氯氟烃、硫的成份都在增加。至于二氧化碳含量增加是否会引起温室效应，人类活动对气候环境的影响究竟多大，科学界有不少争议，还有待于科学的证实。这也是今后１０年研究工作面临的挑战。”
    在谈了酸雨污染、土地沙漠化、臭氧层遭破坏等问题以后，博林教授放慢了速度，一字一句地说：“对于人类面临的环境问题，我们现在就要考虑应该和可能做些什么，采取什么共同的战略。如果等到气候出现巨大变化时再采取措施就太晚了。”
    博林教授认为，环境保护问题已不再是一个学术问题，而是政治问题。对于全球性的环境变化，需要由来自不同国家的各个学科的专家合作研究，各国政府应该给予足够的重视，采取合作态度，要使全人类都懂得保护环境的重要，为未来几代人的生存环境着想。
    他主张，发达国家与发展中国家在这个问题上应该加强合作。他同意这样的看法：发达国家的工业历史远比发展中国家的长，在环境受污染方面应当承担更多的责任。他认为，目前工业发达国家作出的努力还不够，一些国家由于顾虑费用增加，不愿意使用先进的技术来减少环境污染，也不愿意帮助发展中国家治理环境。这是非常短浅的目光。同时，他强调，发展中国家应当积极参加国际讨论和合作研究，争取同发达国家合作解决面临的环境问题。他曾两次访华，同中国气象学界有过不少接触。他认为，中国有一批很优秀的专家，他们应当在国际合作研究中发挥更多的作用。他也指出，中国面临的主要问题是能源问题。中国把煤作为主要能源，但使用效率很低。他诚恳地说：“你们需要更多的能源，但是在发展工业时要加强对空气污染等方面的控制，包括控制二氧化碳增加。这要花费更多的资金，但从长远看对你们的经济是有利的。”
    博林从３２岁开始担任斯德哥尔摩大学国际气象学院院长后，一直积极从事推进国际合作研究工作。６０年代中期，他担任国际科联大气科学委员会主席，在跨学科的“全球大气研究计划”中作出了杰出的贡献。
    进入８０年代后，他作为国际科联特设委员会主席，又为“国际地圈—生物圈计划”的设计和通过发挥了关键作用。他说：“这是一个由来自３７个国家的１７４名科学家参加的多学科综合研究计划。它是为了从整体上了解人类生存的地球环境的变化，包括自然的和人为的变化，研究与这些变化相联系的地圈与生物圈之间的相互作用。其研究成果将会增强我们对未来可能发生的重大全球性变化的预测能力，并为合理安排地球资源提供全面的科学依据。这是一个关系到人类未来生存环境的战略计划。”博林教授特别指出，这个计划得到了中国方面的积极支持。
    博林教授是现代气象学创始人之一罗思贝的学生。在罗思贝于１９５７年去世后，他承担了领导斯德哥尔摩大学气象学院的重任。虽然这使他在研究室的时间减少了，但他还是成功地进行了探空火箭、大气与海洋相互作用等方面的研究，发表了一百多篇科学论文。由于他对气象学的杰出贡献以及在促进国际气象学合作研究方面所作出的努力，他赢得了很多荣誉。
    笔者请他谈谈在事业上取得如此成功的经验时，他略微思索了一下说：“在研究工作中与同事的合作是至关重要的。世界上很少有人能够只凭自己的才智而成为科学领域的权威。人的创造力只有处于和谐合作的气氛中才能得到充实和发挥。为了赢得这种气氛，必须学会胸怀开阔，善于接受各种批评。这是我的老师罗思贝倡导的精神。我对自己的学生也是这样强调的。”
