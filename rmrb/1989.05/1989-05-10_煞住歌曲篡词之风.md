	In recent years, the trend of song lyric plagiarism has been worsening, almost spreading throughout the country. Cassette publishers have taken advantage of this to make huge profits, while lyric and music composers have expressed their grievances. Despite repeated criticism from the media, the situation remains unchanged. People cannot help but ask: Can this trend not be stopped?

	Song lyric plagiarism often involves taking familiar songs, even those from the 1950s and 1960s or from the Cultural Revolution, removing the original lyrics, and inserting new ones. These new lyrics are often vulgar and unworthy, rarely appearing in formal large-scale concerts, and can only be found in performances of lower quality. More often, they are found in cassettes, the most widely distributed and fastest-spreading medium today. Currently, many cassettes sold on the streets contain such content, either entire tapes of plagiarized songs or a few mixed in with others.

	The reason these cassettes can be sold in such large quantities, in the millions, is multifaceted. For example, the content of the lyrics caters to people's curiosity. However, the main reason is related to the declining quality of the cassette publishing industry in recent years. Many publishers, disregarding social benefits and the rights of lyric and music composers, and even their own reputation, compete to publish these for profit. This is likely the result of the current trend in the commercialization of culture, which devalues cultural quality. The prevalence of lyric plagiarism is also due to the lack of, or incomplete and imprecise, laws and regulations regarding copyright, making it impossible to legally handle and stop such infringements in a timely manner.

	The trend of song lyric plagiarism has damaged the creative enthusiasm of lyric and music composers, harmed the healthy development of the music industry, and affected the cultural quality of society. We hope that relevant departments will take action to stop this behavior.

　　煞住歌曲篡词之风
    顾土
    近年来，歌曲篡词之风愈演愈烈，几乎泛滥全国。磁带出版商们借此大赚其钱，词曲作者们为之怨声四起，虽经舆论再三抨击，仍无济于事。人们不禁发问：难道这股歪风就煞不住吗？
    歌曲篡词多是把人们熟悉的歌曲，甚至是五六十年代，或者“文革”中的作品搬出来，抽去原词，塞入新的词汇。这些新填词大多庸俗不堪，在正式的大型演唱会上几乎不敢出头露面，只能混迹于品位较低的演出中，而更多的是在磁带这种目前传播面最广传播速度最快的形式里曝光。现在街头巷尾行销的磁带中，有不少属于这类货色，有的是整盒的篡词之作招摇过市，有的则是在一盒磁带中穿插着几首。
    这类磁带能堂而皇之地上百万盒发行，原因是多方面的，譬如词的内容迎合了人们的猎奇心理等，但主要是和近几年磁带出版业的品格日益低下有关。许多出版商竟不顾社会效益，不顾是否侵犯词曲作者的权益，甚至不顾自身的声誉，争相出版以逐利。这恐怕也正是现在文化商品化中出现的轻视文化品格的社会风气所熏染的结果。篡词行为日盛还在于有关版权的法律和条例的缺少、不健全、不精确，使得对这种侵权行为不能被依法处置，及时制止。
    歌曲篡词之风已损害了词曲作者的创作热情，损伤了歌坛的健康肌体，影响了社会的文化品格。我们期望有关部门制止这种行为。
