Cuban athlete Javier Sotomayor is currently the highest jumper in the world. On the eve of the Seoul Olympics, he cleared a height of 2.43 meters. In early March of this year, he cleared the same height in an indoor competition, making him the only athlete to hold both the world indoor and outdoor high jump records simultaneously. Achieving this feat is no easy task, as there are currently only seven track and field athletes who hold both indoor and outdoor world records in a single event.

Sotomayor's high jump talent was evident at the age of 14 when he cleared 2 meters. In 1986, he won the Pan American Games junior men's high jump championship with a height of 2.36 meters. At the time, he was only 18 years old, and the previous best record for a jumper of his age was 2.35 meters.

Sotomayor's creation of the indoor high jump world record of 2.43 meters was akin to breaking through a formidable fortress, ending the monopoly of Trenkle, Mogenburg, and Schebari on the world record for this event, and unifying the indoor and outdoor records.

The 21-year-old Sotomayor has recently attempted to break new records. He expressed that it is possible to clear a height of 2.45 meters this summer.

　　世界第一飞人：索托马约尔
    古巴运动员哈维尔·索托马约尔是目前世界上跳得最高的人。汉城奥运会前夕，他越过２米４３的横杆。今年３月初，他在室内比赛中越过同一高度，独揽世界室外和室内跳高纪录于一身。能够达到这一成就实属不易，因为同时保持一个项目室内外世界纪录的田径运动员目前只有７个人。
    索托马约尔的跳高才华是在１４岁时显露出来的，当时他跃过了２米。１９８６年，他以２米３６的成绩获得泛美运动会２０岁以下青年组男子跳高冠军。当时他只有１８岁，而以往世界上这一年龄选手的最好成绩是２米３５。
    索托马约尔创造室内跳高２米４３世界纪录，形同攻破了一座坚固的堡垒，打破了特伦哈特、默根堡和舍贝里对这个项目世界纪录轮流坐庄的垄断，把室内和室外纪录统一起来。
    ２１岁的索托马约尔近来几次冲击新的纪录。他表示，今年夏季有可能越过２米４５的高度。
