I wish the mountains and rivers stretching for thousands of miles would disappear, and the stars in the sky would fall one by one. Without space, without distance, two hearts would draw close, so close that their heartbeats would be indistinguishable.

A glance that seems indifferent, a smile that seems merely polite, a nod that seems like a first encounter on a journey. All of these have been burned away by intense heat, leaving only the fiery, unyielding spirit of long-sought desire and mutual allure...

Does an unexpected encounter make the traveler's steps heavy? Or does it fill his bag with loneliness? Or perhaps with an unattainable pursuit? These questions need not be asked. As long as in that moment of encounter, we have a heartfelt smile, a selfless sincerity, and an eternal joy and sorrow. As we dine together, the setting sun is at our feet. We can forget the past and not think of the future. Then, the traveler will set out the next day, safely reaching a new stop.

　　真诚
    柯蓝
    愿几万里的山山水水消失，愿高空的星星纷纷下落。没有空间，没有距离，两颗心靠拢，靠拢到分不清心跳。
    一束似乎是并不介意的眼光，一朵似乎仅仅是出于礼貌的微笑，一个似乎是旅途初次相遇的点头。这一切都被炽热的火烧去了它的外壳。只剩下那炽热不化的追求已久的精灵和相互的诱惑……
    意外的相逢，使旅人的步履沉重？还是使他的背囊装满了孤独？抑或是装满了那无法达到的追求？这些都无须细问。只要我们能在相逢的一瞬，有深情的微笑，有真诚的忘我，有永恒的欢乐和忧愁。在我们共进晚餐的时候，有飞霞在我们的脚下。能忘记过去，也不想未来。那么，明天旅人就会启程，平安到达新的驿站。
