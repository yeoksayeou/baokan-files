Comrade Wang Yuanhua:

I read your article "Theoretical Construction and Conceptual Renewal" in the *People's Daily* (published on February 10) and it sparked some thoughts. I wanted to share my views with you. Due to various tasks and the need to look up some materials, I am only now able to put pen to paper.

I fully agree with your emphasis on the need for Marxist basic principles to deepen and develop with practice. If basic principles cannot develop, then isn't Marxism essentially stagnant? Therefore, as you said, treating Marxism as a "commentary on commentaries" is completely unacceptable.

You mentioned that Lenin's primary goal was to oppose the political views of Bogdanov and others, and to introduce the concept of party-line ideology into philosophy. This involves two issues: how to evaluate the concept of party-line ideology in philosophy, and whether Lenin introduced this concept into philosophy because he opposed Bogdanov's political views. Regarding the first issue, there are differing opinions, and I haven't studied it in detail, but it seems that at least there is a tendency to oversimplify the understanding and discussion of the concept of party-line ideology in philosophy. Regarding the second issue, I think the situation is more complex. At that time, Bogdanov's political views aligned with the Bolsheviks. In 1904, he was elected as a member of the "Bolshevik Committee Standing Committee" at the "Meeting of 22 Bolsheviks"; he was elected to the Central Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party as a representative of the Bolsheviks in the Third (1905), Fourth (1906), and Fifth (1907) Congresses. Therefore, he was in the same party and faction as Lenin. Lenin wrote *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism* to draw a philosophical line between himself and Bogdanov. At the same time, Lenin believed that philosophical differences could be separated from political views. Lenin agreed with Plekhanov's philosophical critique of Mach's philosophy, but he opposed Plekhanov as a Menshevik in political terms. Lenin opposed Bogdanov's philosophical alignment with Mach's ideas, but he was willing to maintain an alliance with Bogdanov as a Bolshevik. This created a complex relationship between political and philosophical views. In the past, we often oversimplified this complex relationship, assuming that political unity and philosophical differences are incompatible. Is this not one of the roots of our past over-politicization of philosophical debates?

On February 25, 1908, Lenin wrote a long letter to Gorky about his philosophical differences with Bogdanov. In my opinion, this letter is very important and instructive. Unfortunately, due to the dominant view that oversimplified the relationship between philosophy and politics, Lenin's letter did not receive the attention it deserved in our country. For example, this letter was not included in the four-volume *Selected Works of Lenin* published in China.

In the letter, Lenin introduced the process of philosophical disagreements among the Bolsheviks to Gorky, mentioning that as early as the spring of 1904, he had expressed his disagreement with Bogdanov's philosophical views. However, Lenin emphasized: "In the summer and autumn of 1904, our views were completely in agreement with those of Bogdanov and several other Bolsheviks. We reached an understanding that we would not discuss philosophy, treating it as a neutral zone. This alliance lasted throughout the revolutionary period, allowing us to jointly implement the revolutionary strategy of the Social Democrats (Bolshevism), which I firmly believe is the only correct strategy."

Later, due to the publication of a series of works promoting their philosophical views by Bogdanov and others, the philosophical disagreements among the Bolsheviks sharpened. Lenin read these works and was "so angry he almost went mad." Lenin said in the letter: "Of course, we are ordinary Marxists who have not studied philosophy, but why do they have to deceive us like this, presenting these things as Marxist philosophy!"

Therefore, Lenin began writing *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism*. However, Lenin did not advocate breaking off political relations due to sharpening philosophical differences. At that time, both Lenin and Bogdanov were editors of *Proletarian* (there were three editors in total), and the editorial board of *Proletarian* was the ideological representative of the Bolsheviks. In response to the German magazine *New Times* publishing Bogdanov's article on Mach and casually stating that the philosophical differences between Plekhanov and Bogdanov had the tendency to become factional differences within the Russian Social Democratic Party, the editorial board of *Proletarian* unanimously agreed that it was necessary to declare: "This philosophical debate is not actually a factional debate, and the editorial board believes that it should not become a factional debate; any attempt to turn this difference into a factional difference is fundamentally wrong. In either faction, there are supporters of both philosophical schools."

This declaration was drafted by Lenin. That is, Lenin continued to advocate "treating philosophy as a neutral zone" to maintain unity in political strategy among the Bolsheviks.

Lenin explained to Gorky in the letter:

"I think it is necessary to frankly tell you my views. I think that some philosophical disputes among the Bolsheviks are completely unavoidable now. But to split because of this, I think, is foolish. We formed an alliance to implement a set strategy within the workers' party. Up to now, we have implemented this strategy without any disagreements."

"To hinder the implementation of the revolutionary strategy of the Social Democratic Party within the workers' party because of disputes over whether it is materialism or Machism, I think, is an unforgivable stupidity. Our philosophical debates should not harm *Proletarian* and the Bolshevik faction within the party. This is completely possible."

Acknowledging this possibility and striving for it is indeed a very wise guiding principle. It is possible to accommodate and maintain philosophical differences within a political alliance, and even to engage in philosophical debates. Not to split the political alliance due to philosophical differences is a necessity for the revolutionary cause.

When Lenin wrote *Materialism and Empirio-Criticism* to systematically criticize Bogdanov's philosophical views, he adhered to this principle.

Of course, we know that the political alliance between Lenin and Bogdanov eventually broke down. In the June 1909 expanded editorial meeting of *Proletarian*, Bogdanov was expelled from the Bolshevik ranks. But this was not due to his philosophy, but because he became the leader of the "Ultimatumists," clearly lacking "principled and strategic unity" with the Bolsheviks; because his recent actions were "destroying the organizational unity of the Bolshevik faction"; because he gave a negative response to the question of whether to obey and implement the resolutions of the expanded editorial board of *Proletarian* (see the resolution of this expanded editorial meeting).

This is a later development. Now, let's return to Lenin's letter to Gorky in February 1908. Why did Lenin discuss the philosophical differences within the Bolsheviks with Gorky? Because, one important implication of Lenin's advocacy for "treating philosophy as a neutral zone" was not to propagate Bogdanov's philosophy in *Proletarian*, the Bolshevik organ, and not to link the Bolshevik faction, which represented the strategic line of the revolutionary faction of the Russian Social Democratic Party, with empirio-criticism. At that time, Gorky had some philosophical connection with Bogdanov, and Gorky wrote an article for *Proletarian* that touched on this philosophy. Lenin disagreed with publishing this article and suggested that Gorky modify the article: remove everything that was even indirectly related to Bogdanov's philosophy to another place, and what was unrelated to Bogdanov's philosophy could be written as several articles for *Proletarian*.

It is worth noting that Lenin believed that most of Gorky's article was unrelated to Bogdanov's philosophy, and Lenin did not generally oppose Gorky publishing articles related to Bogdanov's philosophy, but only opposed publishing such articles in *Proletarian*. Lenin said: "Fortunately, you can write articles elsewhere besides *Proletarian*."

It is particularly noteworthy that Lenin also told Gorky: "I believe that artists can draw many beneficial things from any philosophy." "I completely and absolutely believe that in the matter of artistic creation, you are an authority, and you will draw conclusions greatly beneficial to the workers' party from your own artistic experience, even from idealist philosophy."

What a wonderful passage! It not only embodies a proletarian politician and Marxist philosopher's respect for artists and their artistic experience but also expresses a very sober and pragmatic view of the relationship between art and philosophy. This view is so different from the simplistic and vulgarized view of the relationship between art and philosophy that we have been accustomed to for many years!

Lenin's letter to Gorky is published in Volume 13 of Lenin's Collected Works, pages 425-432 (old edition). I have quoted many passages here, but it is actually unnecessary. If you read the original letter, I believe you will feel great joy.

Yours sincerely,

Gong Yuzhi

　　哲学分歧和政治一致能否兼容？
    ——龚育之致信王元化：谈列宁对波格丹诺夫的批判
    ●列宁写《唯物论和经验批判论》，是为了在哲学观点上同波格丹诺夫划清界限，同时列宁始终坚持哲学的分歧可以同政治观点分开，这样就能避免在复杂斗争中的简单化
    ●列宁认为：在一个政治同盟内部可以容纳和保持哲学分歧，甚至展开争论，坚持这个方针是革命事业的需要元化同志：
    从《人民日报》上读到你的《理论建设与观念更新》（载２月１０日），引起一点思考，想同你交换意见。因为忙于杂事，又因为还要查一点材料，直到今天才提起笔来写这封信。
    我很赞成你着力阐述的马克思主义基本原理也要随着实践发展而不断深化和发展的观点。如果说，基本原理不能发展，那么，马克思主义岂不是“基本上”不能发展了吗？所以，正如你所说的，“以经生注经的方式去对待马克思主义”，是完全要不得的。
    你说列宁主要是要反对波格丹诺夫等人的政治观点，而把党派性观念引入哲学。这里涉及两个问题，一个是哲学的党派性观念如何评价，一个是列宁是否因为要反对波格丹诺夫的政治观点而把党派性观念引入哲学。关于前一个问题，现在有不同意见，我没有仔细研究，看来至少是对哲学的党派性观念的理解和论述中有简单化的毛病吧。关于后一个问题，我觉得情况较为复杂。当时，波格丹诺夫在政治观点上，属于布尔什维克派。他１９０４年在“２２个布尔什维克的会议”上被选为“布尔什维克委员会常务局委员”；在第三次（１９０５年）、第四次（１９０６年）、第五次（１９０７年）代表大会上代表布尔什维克被选入俄国社会民主工党中央委员会。所以，他同列宁是一个政党、一个政派的。列宁写《唯物论和经验批判论》，是要在哲学观点上划清同波格丹诺夫的界限。同时，列宁认为，哲学分歧同政治观点可以分开。列宁在哲学观点上赞同普列汉诺夫对待马赫哲学持批判态度，但在政治观点上他是反对作为孟什维克的普列汉诺夫的。列宁在哲学观点上反对波格丹诺夫对待马赫哲学持追随态度，但在政治上他是愿意同作为布尔什维克的波格丹诺夫保持同盟里的。这出现了政治观点和哲学观点的分歧和一致的复杂关系。而过去我们常常把这种复杂关系简单化了，以为政治观点的一致同哲学观点的分歧是不可兼容的。这是不是我们过去把哲学争论过分政治化的一个根源呢？
    １９０８年２月２５日列宁就他同波格丹诺夫的哲学分歧给高尔基写了一封长信。依我看，这封信很重要，对我们很有教益。可惜过去大概是由于那种把哲学同政治的关系过分简单化的观点占了统治地位，列宁这封信在我国没有得到应有的注意。比如说，我国编选的《列宁选集》四大卷中，就没有选这封信。
    列宁在信中向高尔基介绍了布尔什维克在哲学问题上意见分歧发展的过程，说到１９０４年春天他就向波格丹诺夫表示过不同意他的哲学观点。但是，列宁强调：“１９０４年夏天和秋天我们同波格丹诺夫等几个布尔什维克的意见完全一致，我们订立了默契，大家不谈哲学，把哲学当作中立地区，这个同盟在整个革命时期一直存在着。它使我们有可能在革命中共同贯彻革命的社会民主派（＝布尔什维主义）的策略，这种策略我深信不疑地认为是唯一正确的策略。”
    以后，由于波格丹诺夫等人发表了一批宣传他们的哲学观点的著作，布尔什维克中间的哲学分歧尖锐化了。列宁读了这些著作，“气得简直要发疯”。列宁在信中说：“当然，我们是普通的马克思主义者，对哲学没有研究，但是为什么要这样欺侮我们，竟要把这些东西当作马克思主义哲学奉送给我们！”因此列宁开始写《唯物论和经验批判论》了。
    但是，列宁并没有主张由于哲学分歧尖锐化而实行政治关系的破裂。当时，列宁和波格丹诺夫都是《无产者报》的编委（编委共三人），《无产者报》编辑部是布尔什维克的思想代表者。针对德国《新时代》杂志译载波格丹诺夫论马赫的文章时，信口开河地说，普列汉诺夫和波格丹诺夫的哲学分歧有变成俄国社会民主党内孟什维克和布尔什维克的派别分歧的趋势，《无产者报》编辑部三人小组一致认为有必要声明：“这种哲学上的争论实际上并不是派别的争论，而且编辑部认为，这也不应当成为派别的争论；一切想把这种分歧当作派别分歧的企图，都是根本错误的。无论在这种或那种派别里，都有两种哲学流派的拥护者。”
    这个声明是列宁起草的。就是说，列宁继续主张“把哲学当作中立地区”，以求保持布尔什维克之间在政治策略上的一致。
    列宁在信中向高尔基解释说：
    “我认为有必要把自己的意见直率地告诉你。我认为，现在布尔什维克之间在哲学问题上发生某些争吵是完全不可避免的。但因此而闹成分裂，我看是愚蠢的。我们订立同盟是为了在工人政党内执行既定的策略。直到现在为止，我们执行这个策略始终没有意见分歧。”
    “由于争论究竟是唯物主义还是马赫主义而妨碍了在工人政党内执行革命的社会民主党的策略，我看这是不可宽恕的蠢事。我们进行哲学上的争论应该使《无产者报》和布尔什维克这个党内派别不致受到伤害。这是完全可能的。”
    承认这种可能性，力争这种可能性，这实在是一种很高明的指导方针。在政治同盟内部可以容纳和保持哲学分歧，甚至展开哲学争论。决不因哲学分歧而破裂政治同盟，这是革命事业的需要。
    列宁写《唯物论和经验批判论》，系统地批判波格丹诺夫的哲学观点的时候，是坚持这个方针的。
    当然，我们知道，列宁和波格丹诺夫之间的政治同盟后来还是破裂了。在１９０９年６月《无产者报》扩大编辑部会议上，波格丹诺夫被开除出布尔什维克的队伍。但这不是因为他的哲学，而是因为他成了“最后通牒派”的首脑，同布尔什维克“明显地缺乏原则上和策略上的一致”；因为他近来的行动，“是在破坏布尔什维克派组织上的统一”；因为他“对是否服从和执行《无产者报》扩大编辑部决议的问题做了否定的回答”（见这次编辑部扩大会议的决议）。
    这是后话。现在再回到列宁１９０８年２月给高尔基的信。列宁为什么要跟高尔基谈布尔什维克内部哲学分歧的情况呢？因为，列宁所主张的“把哲学当作中立地区”的一个重要含义，就是不在《无产者报》这份布尔什维克机关报上宣传波格丹诺夫哲学，不要把代表俄国社会民主党革命派的策略路线的布尔什维克派同经验批判论联系在一起。而高尔基那时同波格丹诺夫在哲学观点上有某种联系，高尔基为《无产者报》写了一篇涉及这种哲学的文章。列宁不同意登载这篇文章，建议高尔基最好把文章修改一下：把那些即使是同波格丹诺夫哲学间接有关的一切都挪到别处去，凡是同波格丹诺夫哲学无关的可以写成若干篇文章给《无产者报》。
    值得注意的是，列宁认为，高尔基的文章大部分同波格丹诺夫哲学没有关系，而且列宁并不一般地反对高尔基发表同波格丹诺夫哲学有关的文章，只是反对在《无产者报》上发表这样的文章。列宁说：“好在你除了《无产者报》以外还能在别的地方写文章。”
    尤其值得注意的是，列宁还向高尔基说：“我认为艺术家可以在任何哲学里汲取许多对自己有益的东西。”“我完全地、绝对地相信，在艺术创作问题上你是权威，你从自己的艺术经验里，从即使是唯心主义的哲学里汲取这种观点，你一定会作出大大有利于工人政党的结论。”
    这段话写得多么好！不仅体现了一个无产阶级政治家、马克思主义哲学家对于艺术家及其艺术经验的尊重，而且表达了对艺术与哲学的关系的十分清醒的、实事求是的观点。这种观点同我们多年来习惯了的对艺术同哲学关系的简单化庸俗化观点，是多么不同呵！
    列宁给高尔基的这封信，载于列宁全集第１３卷第４２５—４３２页（旧版）。我在这里抄了许多段落，其实是多余的。你看看原信，相信你一定会感到极大的喜悦。
      　　　　　　此致
    敬礼！
