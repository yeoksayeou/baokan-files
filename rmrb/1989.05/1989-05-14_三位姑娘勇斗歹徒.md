Three young women bravely fought against a robber.

At around 2:00 AM on March 21, Jin Aifen, a savings accountant at the Agricultural Bank of China's Zhongguan Village Savings Office in Quyang County, Hebei Province, was awakened by the sound of someone trying to break into the door. She looked up and saw a dark figure. She shouted, "Who's there!" Before she could finish her sentence, she was struck on the head with an iron bar, causing her to lose consciousness.

Xing Gao and Shi Chenghui, who were on duty with Jin Aifen, woke up and sat up in bed. The intruder noticed them and struck Xing Gao on the head with the iron bar. Xing Gao quickly moved her head, and the bar hit her, causing her to feel dizzy. In the moment the robber turned on his flashlight, she saw that the criminal had a black cloth covering his face, with only two gleaming eyes visible. Xing Gao realized that the robber was there to steal money, so she quickly kicked the safe's password dial with her foot, scrambling the safe's combination. Still not satisfied, she reached out to turn the dial again, but was struck by the robber's bar and fell into a pool of blood. Shi Chenghui shouted loudly, "Help! There's a bad guy!" and was also struck unconscious by the robber's bar.

The robber noticed that Jin Aifen had regained consciousness and threatened her, "Open the safe, or I'll kill you!" Jin Aifen, relying on her professional skills, also remembered the safe's password. She thought to herself, "Even if I die, I cannot let you steal the country's money!" She mustered her strength and walked to the safe, turning the dial. Pretending to open it, she turned the key a few times and said, "I can't open it!" Seeing this, the robber picked up the iron bar and struck Jin Aifen's finger, breaking it in half. Then, he struck her head violently. Jin Aifen fell to the ground, unconscious. Seeing that he couldn't open the safe and had injured three people, the robber fled in a panic.

After the incident, the public security authorities immediately organized an investigation. After 46 hours of intense pursuit, the criminal Li Qingli (a farmer from Zhongguan Village, Quyang County) was arrested and brought to justice.

Jin Aifen, Xing Gao, and Shi Chenghui, the three young women, were rescued by the hospital and are no longer in danger. Their brave and clever actions in fighting against the robber have been praised by the people.

　　三位姑娘勇斗歹徒
    ３月２１日凌晨，河北省曲阳县农业银行中管头村储蓄所值班的储蓄会计靳爱芬，被一阵撬门声惊醒。她抬头一看，门口闪进一个黑影。她大声问：“谁！”话音未落，就被一铁棒打得头破血流，昏了过去。
    和靳爱芬一起值班的高兴敏和出纳员石成慧听到响动，翻身坐起。黑影发觉后，用铁棒朝高兴敏头上打去。小高一侧头，铁棒偏砸下来，她感到一阵头晕。在歹徒打开手电的刹那间，她看见罪犯面蒙黑布，只露出两只贼溜溜的眼睛。高兴敏意识到，歹徒是为抢钱而来，便机智地用脚蹬了一下床头保险柜密码旋钮，打乱了保险柜暗锁号码；她还有些不放心，又用手去转动密码旋钮，结果又挨了歹徒一棒，倒在血泊里。石成慧大声呼喊：“来人哪！有坏人！”也被一铁棒打晕在地。
    歹徒发现靳爱芬苏醒过来，就恶狠狠地对她说：“快打开保险柜，不然就打死你！”靳爱芬凭着自己的业务素质，也想到了保险柜密码。她心里想：我就是死了，也不能让你抢走国家的钱财！她把心一横，挣扎着走到保险柜前，转动了保险柜密码，然后佯装开锁，转动了几下钥匙，便说：“我开不开！”歹徒见状，又抄起铁棒，一棒把靳爱芬的一根手指打掉了半截，接着又向她头上猛击。靳爱芬倒在地上，不省人事。歹徒见保险柜打不开，又伤了三条人命，于是仓惶逃走了。
    事发后，公安机关立即组织侦破。经过４６个小时的紧张追查，罪犯李庆立（曲阳县中管村农民）被逮捕归案。
    靳爱芬、高兴敏、石成慧三位女青年经医院抢救，已脱离生命危险。她们机智、勇敢斗歹徒的事迹，受到了人们的称赞。
