Today in the afternoon, China's national football team played their second friendly match against Japan at the Okayama Prefectural Stadium. The result was a 0-2 loss to the home team.

Japan scored both goals in the first half. The first goal came from a cross from the left side, which was headed in. The second goal was scored after a break through on the right side, with the ball finding the net in the ensuing chaos. Seven minutes into the second half, Wang Baoshan was inexplicably sent off with a red card, leaving China with only 10 players on the field. Despite this, China maintained control for the remainder of the match, but failed to capitalize on several scoring opportunities due to impatience.

　　中国足球队０∶２负于日本队
    本报东京５月１３日电  记者于青报道：今天下午，中国足球队在冈山县运动场同日本队进行了第二场热身赛。结果以０∶２负于主队。
    日本队的两个球都是在上半时打进的。第一个球左边下底传中，头球破网。第二个是右路突入禁区传中，在混乱中攻入。下半场开始７分钟，王宝山被莫名其妙地红牌罚下，从此中国队只有１０人在场。尽管如此，一直控制着主动权，只是几次机会未能把握好，失于急躁。
