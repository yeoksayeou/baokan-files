Since the 1980s, the number of single-parent children in the United States has been increasing. Currently, the number of children living in single-parent households has risen to 15.3 million. Among them, white single-parent children account for 19% of white children, and black single-parent children account for 54% of black children. Single-parent children have become "the most astonishing social phenomenon in the United States over the past 25 years."

In 1988, 50% of white single-parent children were due to their parents' divorce. For black children, 54% of single-parent children were born to unmarried mothers. In nine out of ten single-parent households, the head of the household is female.
