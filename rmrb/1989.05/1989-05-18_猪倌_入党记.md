	The Story of the Pig Farmer Joining the Party
		By Lù Guānghàn

	Huáng Tiānpíng is a sergeant in a border defense unit in Yunnan. His comrades affectionately call him "the pig farmer."

	In 1985, Huáng Tiānpíng enlisted and was assigned to the unit as a livestock keeper. In his first year, he joined the Communist Youth League. Over the next four years, he was commended three times for meritorious service and received five awards. He submitted his application to join the Party three times, each time setting three rules for himself: uphold principles, not yield to personal relationships, and dare to fight against unhealthy tendencies; strictly observe discipline, respect leaders, and unite with comrades; work diligently and complete tasks excellently. If he couldn't meet these standards, he would not join the Party. He kept his word. In June 1987, the Party organization decided to recruit him based on his performance. After learning this, Huáng Tiānpíng voluntarily reported his thoughts to the leadership. He said that once, when the company was slaughtering pigs, an officer took two kilograms of pork without authorization. At the time, he thought that officers worked very hard and taking a few pounds of pork was understandable, so he did not stop it. Later, he realized that this was an act of embezzling public property, and he had not upheld principles. He requested that the organization delay his recruitment into the Party. At the end of 1987, the Party branch discussed his recruitment again and had a heart-to-heart talk with him. Huáng Tiānpíng told the old Party member who talked to him, "Recently, a sow gave birth, and due to my lack of responsibility, three piglets were crushed to death." He requested to be tested by the organization. The Party branch agreed to his request. In September 1988, the Party cell recommended Huáng Tiānpíng for Party membership again, but he still said, "I do not yet meet the conditions for joining the Party," and he requested that the organization continue to test him. Well-meaning people, knowing these circumstances, said he was foolish. Some said, "Others can't wait to join the Party a day earlier, but you keep pushing it back. What's the point?" He sincerely replied, "I dream of joining the Party, but if I join the Party organization in a careless manner and become a Party member in name only, what's the point of joining the Party?" Huáng Tiānpíng's serious attitude towards joining the Party set a good example for his comrades. Some who wanted to join the Party but did not meet the conditions said: they should take Huáng Tiānpíng as a mirror and actively create conditions for joining the Party.

	This year in April, Huáng Tiānpíng has been in the army for five years. The Party branch considered his recruitment into the Party again. At the Party cell and branch meeting, everyone agreed that Huáng Tiānpíng's motivation for joining the Party was pure, his work was outstanding, and he had made contributions to the company's construction. They decided to approve his recruitment into the Party organization.

　　“猪倌”入党记
    陆光汉
    黄天平是云南边防某部一连的上士，战友们亲切地叫他“猪倌”。
    １９８５年黄天平入伍来到部队，被分配当饲养员，入伍第一年就入了团。四年多，他先后两次荣立三等功，５次受嘉奖。他３次在向党支部交入党申请书的同时，又给自己约法三章：坚持原则，不徇私情，敢于同不正之风作斗争；严守纪律，尊重领导，团结同志；工作认真负责，出色完成任务。做不到这几点坚决不入党。他说到做到，１９８７年６月，党组织根据他的表现，准备发展他入党。黄天平知道后，主动向领导汇报自己的思想。他说，有一次连队杀猪，一名干部私自拿走了两公斤猪肉。当时他认为干部工作很辛苦，拿几斤猪肉也是应该，因而没有阻止。事后他认为这是侵占大家利益的行为，自己没有坚持原则，要求组织推迟发展他入党。１９８７年底，党支部再次提出讨论他入党，并同他谈心。黄天平对找他谈心的那位老党员说：“前不久母猪下崽，由于我责任心不强，致使三只小猪崽被压死”。他请求接受组织的考验。党支部同意了他的请求。１９８８年９月，党小组又推荐黄天平入党，他还是说“我入党条件还不具备”，他再次请求组织对他考验。好心的人知道这些情况后，说他傻。有的说：“别人巴不得早一天入党，可你却一推再推，这是图个啥？”他诚恳地回答：“我是做梦都想入党，但如果稀里糊涂就加入了党组织，当个名不副实的党员，那入党还有什么意思呢？”黄天平对待入党的严肃态度，为身边的同志做出好样子，一些想入党而条件不够的人说：要以黄天平为镜子，积极创造入党条件。
    今年４月，黄天平入伍已是第五个年头了。党支部又考虑到他的入党问题。在党小组和支部大会上，大家认为黄天平入党动机端正，工作出色，为连队建设作出了贡献，通过他加入党组织。
