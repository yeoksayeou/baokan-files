In the ocean of tears, the world of flowers, and the mingling of sorrow and joy, we write this letter to you. As we pick up our pen, tears well up and we ask the heavens, is it true that you have left us forever, never to see the sadness of the world again, never to hear our calls?

I remember the first time we wrote to you, it was eight years ago in April. Our nearly seventy-year-old mother was diagnosed with an incurable disease – lung cancer! Because it was in the late stages, and it was small-cell cancer, the most toxic and fastest-spreading type. Even in foreign countries, such cases are not operated on. The medical community in Shanghai had already sincerely told us that they were "powerless to help" and "beyond their ability to save." We thought of our father, who died tragically on the frontier, in the icy cold and bloody winds, and of our mother, who endured hardships to raise us from infancy to adulthood, experiencing a life full of hardship and bitterness. As daughters, we longed to keep our mother with us for a few more years of happiness. In our despair and deep sorrow, we wrote to you with tears, pleading for you to save our mother. Many people thought it was "illogical and absurd" to write such a letter. They said you were busy with a thousand tasks and were not a doctor, so how could we make such a request of you. We felt desperate and anxious.

However, a beautiful "miracle" happened. You received the letter and quickly issued instructions to Shanghai: "...for a widow like Mrs. Du Zhengrong, there are not many left. Please do everything possible to save her." The medical community in Shanghai was moved and took action, organizing a special rescue team consisting of three major hospitals and four expert doctors to perform a major operation on our mother. Due to the meticulous preparation, Mother survived the surgery, the post-operative heart rescue, the nursing, and the chemotherapy. Miraculously, she is still alive today. Today, Mother sits in front of the television, watching the live broadcast of your memorial service, wiping her tears repeatedly, her tears soaking her bedding.

The second letter was written in April 1986. My sister and I had completed the task of compiling a collection of Father Du Zhengrong's works and came to Beijing to present the draft to you, hoping to receive your comments. You read it and the next day dispatched responsible officials from the Central Committee's Office and the Organization Department's Bureau of Retired Cadres to visit us at the hotel and convey your greetings to our mother. You praised our work on the annotations of the collection, saying it was "well-researched and unique," and personally wrote an inscription: "Du Zhengrong's love for the country runs deep." You also encouraged us: "You should be the second-generation united front targets and do a good job in this regard." Afterward, you personally wrote a letter to the relevant departments, earnestly instructing: "No matter what, take good care of the family of Du Zhengrong." We, who have suffered so much and experienced so many hardships, learned from the relevant reports that you cared so much, as if we were in a garden of flowers under a clear sky, our hot tears could not be held back.

We were tasked with promoting trade across the Taiwan Strait. Last spring, we came to Beijing again. We asked Comrade De Ping to convey our third letter to you. You asked De Ping to tell us: "Trade should be more flexible."

Knowing that you were not in good health, we really wanted to send you some nourishing gifts, but we knew you would not accept our gifts. In March, we heard that you had been wanting to read "Poetry Rhymes" but it was hard to find on the mainland. We wrote a letter asking friends in Hong Kong and our uncle in Taiwan to buy it for you, hoping you could borrow it to read. On the day after we heard the news of your passing, we received "Poetry Rhymes" sent from Hong Kong and Taiwan. This delayed mail was soaked with the endless tears of our family.

You did not know our father, nor did you ever see our mother. We are not officials or wealthy people from overseas. However, you cared for us, a family of orphans, widows, the elderly, and the sick, more than our own family. And your care was not just for us! This is why the tears of mourning have formed an ocean, and this is why the ocean of tears has stirred up waves. These waves of tears will form a current, driving us forward with your "honesty and integrity," your "clean hands," and your "selflessness and fearlessness," pushing us forward, ever forward.

Mother knows we are writing to you again, just like the previous times, she repeatedly reminded us, and it is also a shared prayer in our hearts: Uncle Hu Yaobang, please take care of yourself!

　　泪海波涛   
    ——写给胡耀邦叔叔的第四封信
    耀邦叔叔：
    在泪的海洋，花的世界和哀乐声声中，我们给您写的这封信。提笔不禁泪涌问苍天，您真的与我们生死永隔，再也看不见人间悲憾，听不到我们的呼唤？
    记得第一次给您写信，是８年前的４月，年近古稀的母亲患了绝症——肺癌！因为已是晚期，而且是小细胞癌。这是癌中毒性最高，转移最快的一种。这样的病例，国外也无不禁刀。上海医务界已向我们恳切表示他们已“回春无术”、“爱莫能助”。我们想到爸爸惨死在边疆，在冰天雪地、腥风血雨中，妈妈含辛茹苦，把襁褓中的我们扶养成人，一生历尽艰辛酸楚。作为女儿，我们多么盼望能再留妈妈享几年晚福。在走投无路、十分悲痛的情况下，我们含泪向您上书，请求救救妈妈。好多人认为我们写这样的信是“悖理而荒唐”的。他们说您日理万机，且又不是大夫，我们怎能向您提出这样的请求。我们感到了绝望和不安。
    然而，美好的“神话”出现了。您收到信很快批示就下达到上海：“……像杜重远先生这样的遗孀，已没有几位了，请务必抢救。”上海医务界被感动了，行动起来了，组织了特别抢救小组，由３个大医院、４位专家大夫为我妈妈动了特大手术。由于准备工作作得周密充分，妈妈闯过了手术关、术后心脏抢救关、护理关、化疗关，奇迹般活到今天。今天，妈妈坐在电视机前，收看您追悼会的实况转播，频频拭泪，泪透衾衫。
    第二封信，是１９８６年４月。我们姐妹二人完成了为爸爸杜重远汇编文集的任务，来到北京，呈上文集初稿，希望得到您的题示。您阅后，第二天就委派中共中央办公厅和中组部老干部局的负责同志来旅舍看望我们，并说通过我们慰问我们的妈妈。您称赞了我们的文集注释工作“资料翔实，颇有特色”，并亲自为之题词：“杜重远先生为国情深”。还鼓励我们：“要作第二代统战对象，并要作好这项工作”。事后，您又亲自写信给有关部门殷切叮嘱：“无论如何要照顾好杜重远的遗属”。受尽疾苦，饱经劫难的我们，在有关报道上获悉您如此关切，仿佛置身于日丽风和的百花园中，热泪难抑。
    我们肩负促进海峡两岸贸易的任务，去年暮春季节，又来到北京。托德平同志转呈我们给您的第三封信。您要德平转告我们：“贸易最好作得活一些。”
    知您身体不太好，我们多想送您一点补品，但我们知道您不会收受我们的礼物。今年３月间，偶然听到您近日颇想一读《诗韵》而在大陆一时尚难购得。我们便写信托香港的友人和在台湾的姨夫代购，心想借您一阅也好。在您病逝噩耗传来的第二天下午，我们收到了香港和台湾同时寄来的《诗韵》。这迟到的邮件上，洒满了我们一家人绵绵无绝的眼泪。
    您不认识我们的爸爸，更没有看到过我们的妈妈，我们不是达官贵人，也不是海外阔佬。然而您关切我们这孤儿寡母、老弱病残的一家胜似亲人，而您的这种关切，又何止我们一家！这就是为什么悼念您的眼泪汇成了海洋，这就是为什么泪海掀起了波涛。这泪海波涛将形成一股激流，推动着我们跟着您的“光明磊落”，跟着您的“两袖清风”，跟着您的“无私无畏”往前走，再往前走。
    妈妈知道我们又在给您写信，仍像前几次那样，再三叮咛，也是我们心中共同默祷的一句话：耀邦叔叔，您千万保重啊！
