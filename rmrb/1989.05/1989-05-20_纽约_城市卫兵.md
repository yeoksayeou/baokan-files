New York, known worldwide for its high crime rate, has seen the emergence of a volunteer group called the "City Guards" in recent years. This group, organized by citizens, patrols areas such as subways, parks, and train stations where crimes frequently occur. They are highly regarded by the public and are hailed as "New York's heroes."

Ten years ago, this group was founded by thirteen individuals, with Steve as their commander. The "City Guards" are mostly young people aged between sixteen and twenty-eight, with an average age of nineteen. Many of the guards are volunteers who work part-time. Initially, their goal was to protect women and children in the subway from criminals, but their scope of protection gradually expanded. As the group's strength and tactics improved, they began to organize and fight against criminals in any part of New York. At the intersection of 8th Street and 9th Street in Manhattan, there is a street known as "Restaurant Row," which was once a gathering place for prostitutes, drug users, and drug dealers. Even longtime New Yorkers were afraid to approach this notorious area, and tourists avoided it altogether. The street's business owners, seeing their profits plummet and the police unable to help, turned to the "City Guards" for assistance. The guards eagerly responded. Within a few days, the situation on the street improved, and people celebrated their success, boosting the guards' reputation.

The "City Guards" have their own uniforms—red berets and shirts with bird emblems. Their funding comes entirely from donations. Today, the "City Guards" are active in nearly seventy major cities across the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with a total of five thousand members. Just in New York, the "City Guards" have apprehended eight hundred criminals. On average, each member works eight hours per week, taking turns to patrol the streets. In their fight against crime, four guards have lost their lives. However, Steve noted that this number is lower than the number of police officers killed in the line of duty.

To this day, New York City and the police authorities still have reservations about the "City Guards." Mayor Koch warned, "It is dangerous for unarmed children, who have not received any formal self-defense training, to engage in this work." The police authorities also view the guards with skepticism, believing that the guards are encroaching on police territory.

### 纽约“城市卫兵”

　　纽约“城市卫兵”
    葛茂成
    以犯罪之多闻名世界的纽约城，近年活跃着一支由市民自发组织、并自称为“城市卫兵”的卫队。他们专门在地铁、公园、车站等一些易于发生犯罪的地区与形形色色的罪犯作战，深受市民的欢迎，被人们誉为“纽约英雄”。
    十年前由十三人发起组织的这支卫队，司令是斯里夫。“卫兵”们几乎都是十六岁到二十八岁的青年，平均年龄只有十九岁。而且不少卫兵是“自愿兼职者”。他们最初的意图只是保护地铁中易于受罪犯侵扰的妇女和儿童，但后来“保护范围”逐渐扩大。随着卫队“实力”的增强和“战术”的提高，他们已能有组织地同纽约任何地区的犯罪分子作战。在曼哈顿第八街和第九街交汇处，有一条“饭店街”，曾是娼妇、吸毒和贩毒者的群集之地。即使是“老纽约”们也望而生畏，不敢靠近这块“是非之地”。观光者们更是“退避三舍”。该街的老板们眼看生意一落千丈，警方又无能为力，于是求助“卫队”。“卫队”欣然前往。几天之后，这条街上的某些状况改变了，人们为之欢呼，“卫队”声誉鹊起。
    “城市卫兵”有自己的“军服”——红色的贝雷帽和印有鸟类胸饰的衬衣，而他们的经费则百分之百地来自捐赠。现在，“城市卫兵”已出现在美国、加拿大、墨西哥等几个国家近七十余个大城市中，人数已达五千人。仅纽约的“城市卫兵”所“逮捕”的罪犯，就有八百人。他们平均每人每周要工作八小时，轮流在街道上巡逻。在与罪犯作斗争中，已有四名“战士”光荣献身。但斯里夫说，这个数字要比执勤中被杀害的警察少。
    至今纽约市和警察当局对“城市卫兵”仍有顾虑。考奇市长警告说“不带武器，又未经过任何正规防卫训练的孩子们，从事这种工作实在危险。”警察当局还对卫队“冷眼相看”，认为“卫队侵犯了警察的领地”。
