Deng Xiaoping Meets with Khamenei

Deng Xiaoping: China Strives for a Stable International and Domestic Environment to Develop Itself

Khamenei: Iran Hopes for Peace, Superpowers Must Also Accept Peace

Beijing, May 11 — Central Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping said this morning that China must strive for a stable international and domestic environment to develop itself. This is the most important task we have at present. He said that internationally, we should establish friendly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Sino-Soviet relations should also be based on these five principles for peaceful coexistence. In a few days, I will meet with General Secretary Gorbachev to resolve the disputes of the past 30 years and normalize relations between the two countries.

This was what Deng Xiaoping said when he met with the visiting Iranian President, Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei, who was in China for an official friendly visit.

At 11 a.m., Deng, dressed in a dark gray Zhongshan suit, looked spirited. As he walked out of the reception hall, he smiled and waved to the Chinese and foreign journalists present. He warmly welcomed the Iranian President Khamenei, who was visiting China for the first time.

Deng Xiaoping told Khamenei that China and Iran are friends, and we are also friends with Arab countries, including Iraq. We hope you can coexist peacefully. He added that we are all Third World countries and should unite, not waste our strength on internal disputes. We hope for a stable Middle East to take advantage of the current favorable international situation to develop ourselves. President Khamenei said he was very pleased to meet Chairman Deng and expressed his appreciation for Deng Xiaoping's remarks.

Deng Xiaoping also humorously asked President Khamenei about his age. When Khamenei replied that he was 50 years old, Deng Xiaoping said, "This is a fortunate age."

When discussing bilateral relations, Khamenei told Deng Xiaoping that Iran has always closely watched China, and in the past 40 years, China has undergone tremendous changes, especially during the period under your leadership. He said that the friendly relations between the two countries are now entering a new stage, and this visit will further promote this friendship.

When Khamenei mentioned that Iran hopes for peace and all Third World countries hope for peace, and superpowers must also accept peace, but when someone does not accept peace, Deng Xiaoping said, "Peace is precious."

Deng Xiaoping also said that China also has various problems in international relations, but under the current international climate, we can only choose to face difficulties and solve problems through dialogue.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Minister of Energy Huang Yicheng, and other officials were present at the meeting.

    邓小平：中国力争有个稳定国际国内环境发展自己    
    哈梅内伊：伊朗希望和平超级大国也必须接受和平
    本报北京５月１１日讯  记者孙毅报道：中央军委主席邓小平今天上午说，中国要力争有一个稳定的国际环境和国内环境，把自己发展起来，这是我们当前要作的最主要的事情。他说，在国际上要按照和平共处五项原则建立友好关系。中苏关系也要按照五项原则和平共处。再过几天我将同戈尔巴乔夫总书记见面，就３０年来的争端问题加以解决，使两国关系正常化。
    这是邓小平在会见应邀来我国进行正式友好访问的伊朗伊斯兰共和国总统霍贾特伊斯兰·赛义德·阿里·哈梅内伊时讲这番话的。
    上午１１时，穿着深灰色中山装的邓主席精神矍铄。在走出接见厅时微笑着向在场的中外记者挥手致意。他对第一次来中国访问的伊朗总统哈梅内伊表示热烈欢迎。
    邓小平对哈梅内伊说，中伊两国是朋友，我们同包括伊拉克在内的阿拉伯国家也都是朋友，我们希望你们和平共处。他接着说，我们都是第三世界国家，应该团结起来，不要把力量消耗在相互争端上。我们希望有一个稳定的中东，利用当前有利的国际形势发展自己。哈梅内伊总统说，能够认识邓主席感到非常高兴，他表示对邓小平的讲话非常赞赏。
    邓小平还风趣地问哈梅内伊总统的年龄，当哈梅内伊回答是５０周岁的时候，邓小平说，这是幸福的年代。
    谈到两国关系时，哈梅内伊对邓小平说，伊朗一贯密切注视着中国，４０年来，中国取得了巨大的变化，在阁下领导的这段时期是中国最杰出的时期。他说，两国的友好关系现在又将进入一个新的阶段，这次访问将会把这种友好关系向前推进。
    当哈梅内伊总统说伊朗希望和平，所有第三世界国家希望和平，超级大国也必须接受和平，但有人不接受和平时，邓小平说，我还是一句话“和为贵”。
    邓小平还说，中国在国际关系中也有这样或那样的问题，但在当前国际大气候条件下，只有不怕麻烦、通过对话来解决问题，只能作这种选择。
