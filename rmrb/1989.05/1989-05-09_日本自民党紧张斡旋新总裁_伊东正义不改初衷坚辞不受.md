Japan's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has entered the final stages of negotiations to determine the new party president. Bando has hinted that the matter is entirely in the hands of the LDP's Secretary-General Abe, who is fully committed to persuading Ito Seishin to take on the role. Over the past few days, Abe has met with various faction leaders within the party, former Prime Ministers Fukuda and Suzuki, and others to discuss strategies, and has expressed his determination to finalize the presidential candidate by the end of this week. Yesterday, Abe held an informal meeting with Ito for the third time. Ito remains steadfast in his refusal to accept the position.

What has changed is that, in addition to citing his advanced age and poor health as reasons for declining, Ito has also proposed several conditions: the political loss of public trust, insufficient crisis awareness within the party; dissolving factions; reforming the party's mindset to promote clean politics; promoting younger officials within the LDP, and having current officials resign in disgrace. Ito stated that if these conditions are not fully met, at least some form of clear commitment must be made to the public. Otherwise, discussing the succession issue is meaningless, and he bluntly stated: "Changing the cover of the book without changing its content is pointless." Abe finds Ito's proposal difficult to accept and realizes that the presidential candidate, parliamentary operations, and party reform must be considered comprehensively.

According to the scheduled agenda, tomorrow Abe will formally request Ito to take on the presidency. There are also growing calls within the LDP for Ito to consider the interests of the party and the nation and not let down the public's expectations. However, changing the LDP's entrenched system of money politics, which is on the verge of collapse, is not something that one person can achieve. Ito's reasons and demands are also reasonable. As for whether Ito can become the LDP president, it seems to depend first on whether the LDP has the sincerity to break with the past and move forward.

　　日本自民党紧张斡旋新总裁    
    伊东正义不改初衷坚辞不受
    本报东京５月９日电  记者于青报道：从昨日开始，日本政界确定自民党总裁人选的斡旋进入读秒阶段。竹下暗示，此事完全委托自民党干事长安倍全力说服伊东正义出马接任。连日来，安倍与党内各派首领、前首相福田和铃木等人接连会晤，协商对策，并表示力争本周内总裁人选最终确定。昨天，安倍第三次非正式与伊东会谈。伊东依然初衷不改，坚辞不受。
    有变化的是，伊东除了以年迈体弱为理由拒绝外，还提出若干理由或条件：政治失信于民，而党内的危机感不足；解除派阀；改革党的意识，使政治家清廉从政；自民党干部启用年轻人，现任干部引咎辞职等。伊东表示，如果不能完全接受这些条件，至少要以某种形式作出明确表示，以谢国民。否则谈论继任问题毫无实际意义，并直言：“只换书皮，不换书的内容，无济于事。”安倍对伊东的提案感到为难，也意识到总裁人选、国会运行、党的改革三者必须综合考虑。
    按照既定日程，明日安倍将出面正式要求伊东出任总裁。自民党内也呼声鹊起，要求伊东念及党和国家利益，不负众望。但是，改变病入膏肓的自民党金权政治体制，并非一个人力所能及。伊东的理由和要求也是理所当然。至于伊东能否出任自民党总裁，看来首先取决于自民党有无弃旧图新的诚意。
