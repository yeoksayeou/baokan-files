The State Council has issued a notice on rushing to combat disasters and achieve a bumper harvest, and ensuring the summer grain and oil procurement work. The full text is as follows:

To the People's Governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and relevant departments of the State Council:

This year, China's agricultural development has shown new signs of improvement. The main reason is that various levels of party and government leaders have paid great attention to studying policies for developing agriculture, especially grain production, and have taken some effective measures. Various departments have strengthened their support for agriculture. This year, the state will raise the procurement prices for grain, cotton, and oil, further stimulating the enthusiasm of farmers for production. Currently, summer grain crops are growing well, although some areas have suffered from drought, pests, and diseases. If no major natural disasters occur in the near future, the summer grain and oil production is expected to exceed last year's.

The increase in summer grain production this year is of great significance for stabilizing the market, prices, and the overall development of the national economy. It is hoped that the vast number of rural cadres and masses will continue to work hard, overcome disasters, and strive for an increase in summer grain production, and ultimately achieve a bumper harvest for the entire year. Currently, the summer grain procurement work is about to begin. To seize the opportunity to combat disasters and achieve a bumper harvest, and to do a good job in the procurement of summer grain, oil, and other agricultural and sideline products, the following notice is issued:

1. Further rush to combat disasters and achieve a bumper harvest. This year, agricultural pests and diseases are more severe, posing a great threat to summer grain and cotton seedlings. Currently, various places are actively carrying out prevention and control measures. The State Council has held a special meeting and issued a notice on the emergency allocation of pesticides. Please strictly implement the state's pesticide allocation plan, and continue to do a good job in the prevention and control of pests and diseases. At the same time, organize forces to focus on drought relief. Local governments in drought-affected areas should prioritize drought relief work, and relevant departments should ensure the priority supply of electricity and materials needed for drought relief. Efforts should be made to improve the supply of production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, and diesel. Mobilize the masses to focus on spring sowing, summer sowing, and summer management, seize every critical production link, and implement production measures.

2. Effectively ensure the summer grain and oil procurement work. Various levels of government should take responsibility and organize relevant departments to implement procurement measures. First of all, every effort should be made to raise funds to prevent the procurement of agricultural and sideline products from being delayed. Organize banks, financial departments, commercial departments, and other departments to raise funds through multiple channels, and arrange funds according to the local procurement volume and progress to ensure supply. Various specialized banks and rural credit cooperatives should actively organize deposits, reduce general loans, concentrate funds, and prioritize the arrangement of agricultural and sideline product procurement to ensure the timely procurement and storage of grain and other major agricultural and sideline products. Various levels of government should organize commercial departments to timely sell stored goods and accelerate the turnover of funds. Organize banks to clean up various unreasonable fund occupations, clear up arrears, and promptly settle accounts for agricultural and sideline products that have been transferred out or in. Financial departments should promptly allocate grain price differential subsidies to ease the tightness of procurement funds. Funds already allocated for the procurement of agricultural and sideline products should be used for their designated purposes and should not be misappropriated.

3. Strictly implement procurement policies and strengthen market management. Due to the large price difference between grain and oil cards and the market, it is difficult to complete the contracted procurement tasks. Various places should further do a good job in propaganda and mobilization, and explain to farmers in a reasonable manner that grain and oil contracted procurement is both an economic contract and a state task, and is a duty that farmers must fulfill. Various levels of people's governments should take effective measures to strengthen market management during the procurement period, prevent price hikes, and prevent multiple parties from competing for purchases. During the grain and oil procurement, the grain department must strictly implement the procurement policy, implement quality-based pricing, and settle accounts according to the policy regulations. The grain department must ensure that the linked materials are delivered as promised to win the trust of the people. The procurement work should not be stopped due to temporary shortage of procurement funds. In the procurement work, it is also necessary to do a good job in serving the grain-selling masses. To stabilize the market and prices, various places should immediately implement multi-channel operations after completing the summer grain and oil contracted procurement tasks. The grain department should strive to purchase more. Agricultural markets in various places should not be closed at any time to prevent regional blockades and layer-by-layer checkpoints.

4. Rapeseed is the first major agricultural product that farmers in the producing areas will sell to the state this year. The grain department should strictly implement the various procurement policies stipulated by the state, and purchase according to the new ratio adjusted by the state, ensuring that the price is open and that both oil and materials are purchased. For those that cannot return the cake, the price should be compensated. The level and price should not be lowered, nor should the level and price be raised. To prevent the market price of rapeseed from soaring, the provincial price department may, if necessary, set the highest limit price.

　　国务院发出通知
    抓紧抗灾夺取丰收
    做好夏季粮油收购
    新华社北京５月２２日电  国务院发出关于抓紧抗灾夺丰收认真做好夏季粮油收购工作的通知，全文如下：各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府，国务院有关部门：
    今年我国的农业发展有了新的转机，主要是各级党政领导都很重视研究发展农业特别是粮食生产的政策，并采取了一些有效措施，各部门支农观念增强。今年国家将提高粮食、棉花、油料的收购价格，进一步调动了农民的生产积极性。当前，夏粮作物长势良好，虽然局部地区遭受了干旱、病虫等灾害，但如果近期内不再发生大的自然灾害，夏季粮油产量可望超过去年。
    今年夏粮增产对于稳定市场、物价和整个国民经济的发展都具有重要意义。希望广大农村干部和群众继续努力，战胜灾害，力争夏粮增产，进而夺取全年农业大丰收。目前夏粮收购工作即将开始，为了抓紧时机抗灾夺丰收，搞好夏季粮油等农副产品的收购工作，特通知如下：
    一、进一步抓紧抗灾夺丰收。今年农作物病虫害来势较猛，对夏粮和棉苗构成很大威胁。目前各地都在积极开展防治，国务院已召开专门会议并发了紧急调运农药的通知，请各地严格执行国家的农药调拨计划，继续搞好病虫害的防治工作。同时，组织力量，抓好抗旱。受旱地区的各级政府要把抗旱工作放在首位，有关部门要优先保证抗旱所需的电力和物资。要进一步搞好化肥、农药、柴油等生产资料的供应工作，动员群众抓好春播、夏种、夏管工作，不失时机地抓住每一个关键生产环节，把增产措施落到实处。
    二、切实搞好夏季粮油收购工作。各级政府要认真负起责任，组织有关部门落实收购措施。首先要千方百计筹措资金，防止收购农副产品“打白条”。要组织银行、财政、商业等部门，多渠道筹措资金，根据当地的收购量和收购进度组织资金确保供应。各专业银行和农村信用社，大力组织存款，压缩一般贷款，集中资金优先安排农副产品收购，保证粮食等主要农副产品及时收购入库。各级政府要组织商业部门及时调销库存商品，加速资金周转。要组织银行清理各种不合理的资金占用，清理拖欠，对已经调出或调入的农副产品要及时办理结算。财政部门要及时下拨粮食差价款，以缓解收购资金紧张。对已下拨的农副产品收购资金，要保证专款专用，不准挪用。
    三、认真执行收购政策，切实加强市场管理。由于目前粮油牌市差价较大，完成合同定购任务有一定难度。各地要进一步搞好宣传动员，理直气壮地向农民说明粮油合同定购既是经济合同，也是国家任务，是农民应尽的义务，必须保证完成。各级人民政府要采取有力措施，切实加强收购期间的市场管理，防止哄抬价格、多家抢购。在粮油收购中，粮食部门一定要认真执行收购政策，实行优质优价、劣质劣价；要按政策规定兑现挂钩物资，取信于民；不能因为收购资金一时短缺而关门停止收购。在收购工作中还要切实搞好方便售粮群众的服务工作。为了稳定市场、稳定物价，各地在完成夏季粮油合同定购任务以后，要立即实行多渠道经营，粮食部门应力争多议购一些。对各地的农贸市场，任何时候都不要关闭，要防止地区封锁，层层设卡。
    四、油菜籽是产区农民今年首次向国家交售的大宗农产品，粮食部门要认真执行国家规定的各项收购政策，按国家新调整的比例价敞开收购，坚持以质论价，料油兼收，购料返饼，不能返饼的，要用价款补足；不得压级压价，也不得提级提价。为防止市场油菜籽价格暴涨，必要时可由省级物价部门制定最高限价。
