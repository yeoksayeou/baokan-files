In China's economic development layout, three major economic zones—eastern, central, and western—have objectively formed, with significant disparities in development levels between regions. People have recognized that this extreme imbalance in economic development is both a result of the current regional development environment and, to a considerable extent, a continuation and long-term accumulation of historical regional economic operations.

From the perspective of productive forces, China's economic structure is generally divided into three tiers: high-tech industries, traditional industries, and traditional agriculture. China's agriculture is still primarily based on dispersed manual labor, and the development of agricultural productive forces retains the gradual nature of traditional agriculture. Therefore, in the agricultural sector, the consequences and certain economic relationships left over from the long-term imbalanced development of regional economies in history still strongly influence the current regional development. This inheritance of productive forces is most pronounced in the less developed central and western regions where agriculture has a higher economic share. For example, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River were once the most developed agricultural regions in ancient China. After the Tang and Song dynasties, the economic center of the country shifted southward, and the agricultural economy of this region declined, gradually forming a significant gap with the steadily rising agricultural economy of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which persists to this day. In modern times, the forced opening of the southeastern coastal regions not only laid the groundwork for the earliest emergence of Chinese capitalism in this region but also had a clear "stimulating effect" on the subsequent development and high concentration of capitalism in coastal areas. However, the vast inland regions of central and western China have largely remained stagnant and closed for a long time, with little development of capitalism, and many regions have never experienced it. Therefore, the regional economic boundaries of the eastern, central, and western regions were essentially formed at that time. These factors have prepared deep historical conditions for the imbalanced development of regional economies after the founding of the People's Republic.

In terms of the "soft" environment, the differences formed in social structure, cultural accumulation, ideological forms, and national quality during the long-term historical development of various regions also significantly influence the diverse development of regions today and the imbalanced development of regional development.

Therefore, the study of regional economic development must focus on both the current economic environment and the historical conditions. By examining history, one can gain a deeper understanding of the present, reveal the general and specific laws of regional development, and thus make regional development research more comprehensive and holistic. Without a deep understanding of the history of regional economies, it is difficult to draw correct conclusions about regional economic development. Therefore, regional economic history research should be an indispensable part of regional development research. Economic historians should, through their research, delve into the intricacies, clarify the system, deepen the understanding of national and provincial conditions, actively participate in regional development research, and serve economic development.

However, economic history research has long been a weak link in historical studies, and regional economic history research has always been a weak link in economic history research. In recent years, regional economic history research has begun to receive attention. But overall, there is a lack of comprehensive research on the historical environment of regional development and the accumulated consequences of imbalanced development. At the same time, the awareness of participating in practical development is also relatively weak. This situation is not in line with the practical requirements of regional development.

Given the past focus on the study of production relations in economic history research, future regional economic history research should pay particular attention to the development of productive forces within a region. It is necessary to specifically examine the historical changes and characteristics of various elements and levels of productive forces within a region and systematically analyze the historical context of the rise and fall, growth and decline of economic development within this region. It is important to focus on the factors that still influence and constrain current development and clarify what are the foundations and conditions for current development and what are the obstacles and burdens.

Regional economic history research should pay attention to the influence of geographical factors such as mountains, soil, vegetation, climate, and transportation on regional development. These factors slowly but persistently influence the social, economic, and cultural landscape of a region over the long term. At the same time, regional economic history research should also pay attention to human and social factors, such as the lifestyle, values, cultural traditions, and folk customs of the people in a region, which are closely linked to the economic landscape of the region.

Regional economic history is an interdisciplinary field that requires the integration of knowledge and methods from multiple disciplines such as history, geography, archaeology, sociology, economics, and statistics. In terms of specific research methods, comparative research methods have special significance in regional economic history research. Through multi-angle and multi-level comparisons between different regions and different historical periods within the same region, one can objectively understand the regional imbalances in social and economic development and their causes, thus revealing the law-like characteristics of regional development. At the same time, when grasping the historical characteristics of regional development, one should not be limited to the internal examination and longitudinal comparison of the region itself but should also place regional development in the context of the national macro-economy for observation and horizontal comparison. This way, one can understand the position of regional development in the national economic pattern and avoid the phenomenon of replacing the main line of the country's economic development with the economic development level of a certain region. Such research results can, on the one hand, help us clearly grasp the specific laws of regional development, and on the other hand, deepen people's overall understanding of the national situation. In this sense, regional economic history research has great potential for the country's economic reform and development.

　　加强区域经济史研究的现实意义
    夏潮　郭豫庆
    在我国经济发展格局中，客观上形成了梯度发展的东、中、西三大经济地带，区域间开发水平存在着巨大的差距。人们已认识到，这种经济发展的极不平衡现象，既是区域现实发展环境的结果，同时在相当程度上又是历史上区域经济运行的延续和长期积累的产物。
    从生产力水平来看，我国经济结构大体上分为高技术产业、传统工业、传统农业三个层次。我国的农业基本上仍以分散的手工劳动为主，农业生产力的发展仍具有传统农业的那种渐进性。因此，在农业领域，区域经济在历史上长期不平衡发展所形成的后果和遗留下来的某些经济关系仍强烈地影响着现实区域开发。这种生产力的继承性在农业经济比重较大的中西部不发达地区显得最为突出。例如，黄河中下游区域在古代曾是中国农业经济最发达的地带，自唐宋以后，全国经济重心南移，该区域的农业经济就一蹶不振，同长期稳定上升的长江中下游的农业经济逐渐形成了巨大的落差，影响至今尚存。近代，东南沿海地带的被迫对外开放，不仅为中国资本主义在此地带最早产生撒下了诱因，同时也为尔后资本主义的发展和高度集中于沿海地带产生了明显的“刺激效应”。而内陆的中西部广大地区，则在很大程度上长期处于停滞、封闭状态，资本主义很少发展，许多地区甚至从未发生。因此，实际上在当时已基本上形成了东、中、西部的区域性经济边界。这些都为建国后区域经济发展的不平衡准备了深刻的历史条件。
    在“软”环境方面，各区域长期历史发展中在社会结构、文化积累、观念形态、国民素质等方面所形成的差异，也在相当程度上影响着今天区域发展的多元化和区域开发的不平衡。
    因此，区域经济的发展研究既要注重现实经济环境的审视，也离不开对历史条件的考察。通过透视历史，可以更深刻地把握现实，揭示区域开发的一般规律和特殊规律，从而使区域发展研究具有广阔的视野和整体综合性。离开了对区域经济的历史进行纵深认识，区域经济的发展研究便很难得出正确的结论。所以，区域经济史研究应该是区域开发研究不可或缺的组成部分。经济史工作者应该通过自己的研究成果，穷极脉络，彰明系统，深化对国情省情的再认识，以积极参与区域开发研究，为实现经济发展服务。
    但是，经济史研究本是史学研究领域的薄弱环节，区域经济史研究更一直是经济史研究的薄弱环节。近年来，区域经济史研究开始受到重视。但从整体上看，对区域开发的历史环境和区域发展的不平衡积累后果还缺乏总体的综合性研究，与此同时，参与现实开发的意识也比较弱。这种状况同区域开发的现实要求是很不适应的。
    鉴于以往经济史研究中偏重于生产关系考察的事实，今后区域经济史研究应对有关区域内生产力发展的线索予以突出的注重。要具体考察一区域内生产力各要素、各层面的历史变迁和特点，系统地分析此区域内经济发展升沉起伏、消长进退的历史脉络。要着重把握研究至今仍影响和制约现实发展的因素，廓清哪些是现实开发的基础和条件，哪些是现实发展的阻力和包袱。
    区域经济史研究要注意山川、土壤、植被、气候、交通等地理环境对区域开发的影响，这些因素缓慢地但却是长期而潜移默化地影响一个区域的社会经济和文化面貌。同时，区域经济史研究还要重视人文社会因素，如一个区域内民众的生活方式、价值观念、文化传统、民俗风习等等，它们与一个区域的经济面貌也密切联系在一起。
    区域经济史是一门边缘学科，它的研究需要历史学、地理学、考古学、社会学、经济学、统计学等多学科知识和方法的综合应用。在具体研究方法上，比较研究法在区域经济史研究中具有特殊的意义。通过不同地区之间、同一地区不同历史时期之间的多角度、多层次的比较，可以较客观地认识社会经济发展的地域不平衡性及其原因，从而揭示区域开发的规律性特点。同时，在把握区域开发的历史特点时，应不仅仅局限于本区域内的考察和自身的纵向比较，还应当把区域开发放在全国宏观经济背景中去观照和横向比较。这样，既可弄清历史上区域开发在全国经济格局中的地位，又可以避免那种以某一区域的经济发展水平替代整个国家经济发展主线索的现象。此类研究结果，一方面能使我们较清晰地把握区域开发的特殊性规律，另一方面也使人们对国情的整体认识进一步深化。从这层意义上来说，区域经济史研究于国家的经济改革和发展是大有可为的。
