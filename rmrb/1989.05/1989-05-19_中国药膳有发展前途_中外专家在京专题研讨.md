Chinese and Japanese experts in traditional medicine gathered in Beijing recently to engage in a lively academic discussion on the burgeoning field of dietary therapy.

The experts agreed that food products enhanced with various Chinese and Western medicines are not true dietary therapy. With nearly 3,000 years of history, Chinese dietary therapy is guided by the theoretical principles of traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment, using food and medicinal herbs as the main ingredients, complemented by nutritious foods, and processed through traditional Chinese medicine techniques or formulations before being prepared as edible dishes. Clinical evidence has shown that nutritious, non-toxic, edible, and medicinal foods are the finest in traditional Chinese medicine. The development of food-based medicines will change human dietary structures and contribute to improving human health levels.
