With the rise of reforms in the national economy and the development of the scientific and technological revolution, Bulgaria's demand for talent is increasing day by day. To reverse the shortage of talent, in accordance with the first educational reform document, "Outline for the Development of Bulgarian Education," adopted in 1979, Bulgaria has carried out a series of reforms on its original educational system in recent years.

- Establish unified comprehensive technical secondary schools to combine two major educational processes. Bulgaria's primary and secondary education has long been implemented as a 10-year continuous system. Schools are divided into various types, including ordinary schools, vocational technical schools, and secondary specialized technical schools. After implementing the new educational system, the state has combined the two major educational processes—general education and vocational education—to establish unified comprehensive technical secondary schools. The age of children entering school has been changed from 7 to 6 years old, and the school system has been extended to 12 years, divided into three stages of teaching. The first stage is 10 years, mainly providing students with general cultural knowledge education. The second stage is 1 year or 1.5 years, requiring students to master comprehensive technical professional theories and applied knowledge. The third stage is 1 year or 0.5 years, entirely for vocational education, to enable students to proficiently master specific professional skills.

The establishment of unified comprehensive technical secondary schools not only allows students to have a certain level of professional knowledge and practical experience, which is beneficial for further in-depth study in university specialized education, but also enables them to have the basic ability to engage in actual production activities and social activities, making it convenient for them to directly enter the workforce.

- Establish new types of secondary technical schools with junior college characteristics to cultivate "production commanders." The original secondary technical schools in Bulgaria had single teaching content, and graduates could only engage in general technical labor in a certain production field, making it difficult to meet the needs of modern production and scientific management. The new types of secondary technical schools currently established have a 2-year school system. The students are graduates of unified comprehensive technical secondary schools, and the teaching content covers higher-level professional theories and applied knowledge, as well as social psychology and management knowledge.

- Change the structure of higher vocational education, implement teaching-research-production integration. Bulgaria's higher education reform is to change the continuous professional teaching to staged teaching. The school system has been changed from 4 to 5 years to 4 to 6 years. The entire teaching process is also divided into three stages. The first stage ensures the comprehensive development of students in a certain professional field. After this stage, a major examination is conducted to select the best and eliminate the worst, or transfer to other majors. The second stage requires students to master specific design, process, management knowledge, and practical skills. After this stage, students are preliminarily assigned, and their future work units are initially determined. The third stage, in conjunction with the students' future work, carries out scientific research activities and production practice.

Bulgaria has also reformed the scholarship system in higher vocational schools. Some schools have tried replacing scholarships with student loans.

- Popularize cultural knowledge and strengthen the training of in-service cadres. The central and local governments of Bulgaria have established workers' cultural education committees, responsible for leading the training of in-service personnel and regularly conducting cultural knowledge and professional technical examinations for cadres and workers, and using this as a basis for promotions and salary adjustments; establish a "Workers' Cultural Encouragement Fund" to provide material rewards for those with outstanding academic performance.

　　保加利亚积极进行教改
    郭春晓
    随着国民经济领域改革的兴起和科技革命的开展，保加利亚对人才的需求与日俱增。为了扭转人才匮乏的局面，依照１９７９年通过的第一个教育改革文件——“关于发展保加利亚教育事业的提纲”，近年来，保加利亚对原有的教育体制进行了一系列改革。
    ——建立统一中等综合技术学校，实现两大教育过程的结合。保加利亚的初等教育和中等教育一直实行１０年一贯制。学校分普通学校、职业技术学校、中等专业技术学校等多种类型。贯彻新教育体制后，国家把两大教育过程——普通教育和职业教育合并，建立统一中等综合技术学校。儿童入学年龄由７岁改为６岁，学制延长到１２年，分三个阶段教学。第一阶段１０年，主要对学生进行普通文化知识教育。第二阶段为１年或１年半。要求学生掌握综合技术的专业理论和应用知识。第三阶段为１年或半年。全部进行职业教育，以使学生熟练地掌握具体的专业技能。
    建立统一中等综合技术学校，既能使学生具备一定的专业知识和实践经验，有利于在大学分科教育中更好地深造，又能使他们具备从事实际生产活动和社会活动的基本能力，便于直接就业。
    ——建立半高等性质的新型中等技术学校，培养“生产指挥员”。保加利亚原来的中等技术学校，教学内容单一，学生毕业后只能在某一生产领域从事一般性技术劳动，难以适应现代化生产和科学管理的需要。目前建立的新型中等技术学校，学制为２年。招生对象是统一中等综合技术学校的毕业生，教学内容涉及较高层次的专业理论和应用知识，并讲授社会心理学和管理学知识。
    ——改变大专院校教育结构，实行教学—科研—生产一体化。保加利亚的高等教育改革是将专业连贯教学改为分阶段教学。学制由４至５年改为４至６年。整个教学过程亦分３个阶段。第一阶段保证学生在某一专业领域的全面发展。这一阶段结束后，进行一次大的考核，择优汰劣，或转学其他专业。第二阶段要求学生掌握具体的设计、工艺、管理知识和实践技能。这一阶段结束后，对学生进行预分，初步确定他们的工作单位。第三阶段，结合学生将来从事的工作，进行科研活动和生产实践。
    保加利亚还对大专院校的助学金制度进行了改革。一些院校试行用学生贷款来取代助学金。
    ——普及文化知识，加强在职干部培训。保加利亚中央和地方政府设立了职工文化教育委员会，负责领导在职人员的培训工作并定期对干部职工进行文化知识和业务技术考核，并以此为依据进行职务和工资的升降；设立“职工文化鼓励基金”，对学习成绩优异者进行物质奖励。（附图片）
