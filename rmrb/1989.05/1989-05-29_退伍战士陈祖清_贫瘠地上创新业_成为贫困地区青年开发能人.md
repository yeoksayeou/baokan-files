Veteran Chen Zuqing creates new ventures on barren land, becomes a youth development expert in poor regions

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 29th - (Correspondents Zhang Rongrong, You Binjing) With the courage to turn yellow soil into gold, veteran Chen Zuqing has struggled to build a new business on the barren land of his hometown in Xingguo County, Jiangxi. He has paved a path for farmers to become prosperous, becoming one of the top ten youth development experts in poor regions nationwide.

Chen Zuqing returned to his hometown after being discharged from the military in 1985. He organized seven households in the village to raise funds and establish a brick factory. After two years of hard work, the Donghe Brick Factory he led achieved a production value of 750,000 yuan and paid 120,000 yuan in profits. All 50-plus workers in the factory were originally from impoverished or extremely poor households, and now they have all escaped poverty.

Recently, among the 20 million league members and young people in 19 provinces, 660-plus poor counties, and 2,000-plus poor counties nationwide, he was evaluated as one of the top ten youth development experts.

  　贫瘠地上创新业
  　成为贫困地区青年开发能人
    新华社南昌５月２９日电  （通讯员张荣荣、友斌京）军队退伍战士陈祖清以敢叫黄土变成金的气魄，在家乡江西兴国县贫瘠的土地上艰苦创业，走出一条带领农民致富的道路，成为全国贫困地区十大青年开发能人之一。
    陈祖清１９８５年退伍返乡后，联络村里的７户农民筹资办起机砖厂。经过２年艰苦创业，他领导的东河机砖厂实现产值７５万元，上缴利润１２万元。全厂５０多名工人原来都是贫困户、特困户，现在实现了脱贫。
    不久前，他在全国１９个省、６６０多个贫困县，２０００多万团员青年中，被评为十大青年开发能人之一。
