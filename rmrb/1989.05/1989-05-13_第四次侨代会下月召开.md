The fourth session of the National Congress of Returned Overseas Chinese is scheduled to be held on June 28 in Beijing. This was announced at the closing ceremony of the fifth plenary session of the third National Committee of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, which concluded today in Beijing. Wu Xueqian attended the closing ceremony.

During the three-day meeting, the committee members reviewed and approved the draft work report to be submitted to the fourth session of the National Congress, the draft amendments to the constitution of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, and the procedures for electing the fourth National Committee. At this meeting, Zhuang Yanlin was formally confirmed as the vice chairman of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the Committee on Overseas Chinese Affairs of the NPC, Ye Fei, and Director of the State Council's Office for Overseas Chinese Affairs, Liao Hui, encouraged the federation to expand its contacts with overseas Chinese organizations and to make more friends, truly playing the role of a "bridge" connecting overseas Chinese, Chinese living abroad, returned overseas Chinese, and their relatives. Some committee members from Hong Kong and Macau suggested that the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese should strengthen its ties with committee members from Hong Kong and Macau.
