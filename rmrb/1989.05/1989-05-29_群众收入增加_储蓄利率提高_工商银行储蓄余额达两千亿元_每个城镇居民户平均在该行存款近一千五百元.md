The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's savings deposits have seen a significant and steady increase. From the beginning of the year to mid-May, savings deposits increased by 20.09 billion yuan, 7.6 billion yuan more than the same period last year, reaching a total of 200.8 billion yuan. This provides the bank with a stable and reliable source of funds, playing an important role in easing the current supply-demand contradiction, stabilizing the market, and curbing price increases.

The main reasons for the significant increase in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's savings deposits are as follows: the public's income has increased, and their savings capacity has been enhanced. According to statistics, in 1979, the national average annual wage for employees was 648 yuan, with a savings rate of 7.3% per 100 yuan of wages. By the end of last year, the average annual wage for employees had risen to 1695 yuan, with a savings rate of 25.7% per 100 yuan of wages, an increase of 18.4 percentage points. Based on the urban population at the end of last year, if we consider four people as one household, the average savings per household in the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is now 1489.7 yuan, which is more than 1000 yuan higher than the average savings per household in 1979.

Additionally, since last year, the state has taken a series of measures to stabilize savings deposits. For example, since September last year, savings interest rates have been raised twice, and a value-added subsidy has been added for term deposits of three years or more.

　　群众收入增加　储蓄利率提高
    工商银行储蓄余额达两千亿元
    每个城镇居民户平均在该行存款近一千五百元
    本报北京５月２９日讯  中国工商银行储蓄存款大幅度稳步上升，从年初到５月中旬止，共增加储蓄存款２００．９亿元，比上年同期多增加７６亿元，余额已突破２０００亿元，达到２００８亿元。这为银行提供了稳定可靠的资金来源，对缓解当前市场供求矛盾、稳定市场、平抑物价都有着重要意义。
    工商银行储蓄存款大幅度增加的主要原因是：人民群众收入增加，储蓄能力增强。据统计，１９７９年时，全国职工的年平均工资为６４８元，百元工资吸储率为７．３％；到上一年底，职工的年平均工资为１６９５元，百元工资吸储率为２５．７％，提高了１８．４个百分点。按上一年底全国城镇人口数推算，如４个人为一居民户的话，现在平均每个居民户在工商银行存款１４８９．７元，比１９７９年时每个居民户在工商银行存款多了１０００多元。
    另外，去年以来国家采取了一系列稳定储蓄存款的措施。如去年９月以后，两次提高了储蓄利率，同时，对三年以上的定期储蓄增加了保值补贴等。
