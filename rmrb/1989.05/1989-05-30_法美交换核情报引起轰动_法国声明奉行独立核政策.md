A report by an American magazine revealing that France and the U.S. had signed a secret agreement to exchange nuclear weapons intelligence has caused a stir in Paris, with several major newspapers reporting and commenting on the news.

According to today's Le Monde, during General de Gaulle's presidency, France and the U.S. signed a secret agreement in 1961 to exchange information on nuclear weapons manufacturing technology. Due to President de Gaulle's announcement in 1966 that France would withdraw from NATO's military integration, this agreement was not implemented until after 1972 and was revised and updated in 1985.

The above information was published in a recent article in an American magazine. The author, Professor Richard Ullman, served in the U.S. Department of Defense and the Department of Security in the 1960s.

It is reported that the content of the nuclear intelligence exchanged between France and the U.S. includes not only information on nuclear weapons manufacturing technology and multiple warhead ballistic missile data but also intelligence that is "absolutely necessary" for military operations, such as attack targets, to increase the reliability and safety of nuclear operations.

The disclosure of this material on the eve of the NATO summit has attracted the attention of relevant parties in the West, who have quickly responded. The French Ministry of Defense issued a statement saying that intelligence exchange is beneficial to both sides and that this is not a "secret" agreement. The statement said that the exchange of intelligence between France and the U.S. does not hinder France's policy of nuclear independence. France does not rely on foreign countries to produce nuclear weapons.

    法美交换核情报引起轰动
    法国声明奉行独立核政策
    本报巴黎5月30日电  记者张启华报道：由美国一家杂志透露的关于法美缔结秘密协议交换核武器情报的消息，在巴黎引起轰动，几家大报都转述和评论这一则消息。
    据今天《世界报》报道，在戴高乐将军执政时，1961年法美曾缔结一项秘密协议，就核武器制造工艺方面的情报进行交流。由于戴高乐总统1966年宣布法国退出北约军事一体化组织，这项协议实际上到1972年后才执行，并于1985年对它进行了修改和更新。
    上述消息刊于美国一家杂志近日发表的一篇文章，作者理查德·乌尔曼教授60年代曾在美国国防、安全部门任职。
    据称，法美的核情报交换内容除了核武器制造工艺，包括多弹头弹道导弹资料外，还有军事行动时“绝对需要”的情报、攻击目标等，以增加核行动的可靠性和安全性。
    在北约首脑会议前夕传出的这份材料，引起了西方有关方面的重视，并迅速作出了反应。法国国防部的声明表示，情报交流对双方都是有利的，这不是一项“秘密”协议。声明说，法美之间的情报交流并不妨碍法国奉行的核独立政策。法国并不依靠外国生产核武器。
