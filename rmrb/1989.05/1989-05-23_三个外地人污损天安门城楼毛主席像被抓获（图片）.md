In the afternoon of May 23 at around 2 PM, the portrait of Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate was defaced with paint. The perpetrators were three young people from outside Beijing. They were immediately apprehended by students and civilians on patrol nearby and handed over to the public security authorities.

It is understood that the three individuals are from Hunan Province. They are Yu Mingfei, an art teacher from Liuyang Guandu Middle School, Yu Dongyue, an art editor from Liuyang Daily, and Lu Decheng, a worker from the Xiangyun Transport Team. They filled prepared paint into empty eggshells and threw them at the portrait of Chairman Mao on Tiananmen Gate. The photo shows students questioning one of the suspects (third from the right).

　　三个外地人污损天安门城楼毛主席像被抓获
    ５月２３日下午２时许，天安门城楼上的毛主席画像被人用颜料污损。他们是来自外地的３名青年，当场被在周围执勤的大学生和群众抓获，并被送公安机关。
    据悉，这三人来自湖南。他们是浏阳官渡中学教师裕鸣飞、浏阳报美术编辑俞冬岳、浏阳湘运车队工人鲁德成。他们把调制好的颜料灌到空鸡蛋壳里，掷向天安门城楼上的毛主席像。图为大学生在盘问其中的一人（右三）。
