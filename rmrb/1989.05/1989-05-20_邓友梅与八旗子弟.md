Recently, the Central Television Station has grandly presented a "Beijing-flavored" television series, which is the six-episode drama "That Five" adapted from the novel of the same name by the renowned writer Deng Youmei, who is famous for his depictions of Beijing's market life.

Deng Youmei was born in Tianjin and has long resided in Beijing, but he is not a Banner person. However, in recent years, he has consecutively published several well-known works depicting the lives of Banner people, such as "Smoke Bottle," "Double Cat Picture," "Searching for Hua'er Han," "That Five," and "The Descendants of Suoqi." "Smoke Bottle" was also adapted into a film by Hong Kong director Li Hanxiang, titled "Eight Banner Descendants." Deng Youmei attributes all these to the "fortune" he gained during his early hardships.

In 1957, Deng Youmei was labeled a "rightist" due to his works and was exiled to the northeast. During his exile, he fortuitously met a large number of Banner people (who were also suffering at the time). Deng Youmei said that these people were mostly descendants of past royal families, including grandsons of princes and ministers, sons-in-law of envoys to Russia, and at the very least, guardians of the Summer Palace.

Deng Youmei's interactions with these Banner people not only enriched his life experiences but also deepened his understanding of the Eight Banner descendants. Deng Youmei said that when the Manchus entered the pass, they were full of upward momentum. Their soldiers were limited to the Eight Banners, and their horses did not exceed ten thousand, but they unified the country relying on the people's upward aspirations and determination to strive for strength. However, after three hundred years of indulgence, the Manchus' spirit of enterprise was completely worn away. Especially the spoiled children, who, at the time of the Qing Dynasty's collapse, did not even know how to make a living, becoming the most useless group of people. However, this tragedy was not caused by them individually, but by historical circumstances. Most of them were often very kind, and some were quite intelligent. Therefore, in his works, besides satirizing those who seek only to eke out a living, Deng Youmei also sympathizes with them and objectively portrays them as people who "are not capable of doing good deeds and are also not skilled at doing bad deeds."

Deng Youmei's understanding and depiction of Banner people have been widely recognized by the Banner people. After "Smoke Bottle" was serialized in the Beijing Evening News, Puyi's younger brother, Puyi, wrote a scroll with the words "Beijing customs and folkways" and presented it to Deng Youmei, with the heading saying, "The history of the common people is valuable, and the paper is expensive in Luoyang, which is indeed praiseworthy." This shows the high praise. After the news of the filming of the TV series "That Five" spread, the famous singer Hu Songhua voluntarily recommended himself to sing the theme song for the series. It turned out that Hu is also a "Banner person," and moreover, he is from the "Yellow Border."

　　邓友梅与八旗子弟
    最近，中央电视台隆重推出一部“京味”电视连续剧，这就是以描写北京市井生活称著的作家邓友梅据他的同名小说改编成的六集电视剧《那五》。
    邓友梅生于天津，久居北京，但并非旗人。可是，近年来他却连续推出了不少描写旗人生活的名著，如《烟壶》、《双猫图》、《寻找画儿韩》、《那五》、《索七的后人》等。《烟壶》还被香港导演李翰祥搬上银幕，电影名叫《八旗子弟》。邓友梅把这些都归功于他早年落难时得的“福”。
    一九五七年，邓友梅因作品被打成“右派”，放逐外地。他在东北流放期间，恰巧结识了一大批旗人（当时他们也蒙难）。邓友梅说，这些人多为过去的皇亲贵族，有王爷、内务大臣的孙子、驻俄罗斯钦差大臣之女婿，最不济的也是圆明园护园统领。
    邓友梅与这批旗人接触，不仅积累了丰富的生活经验，也更深地理解了八旗子弟。邓友梅说，当初满族人进关时，充满向上的朝气，兵不过八旗，马不过万匹，统一天下全靠人心向上立志争强。但后来三百年养尊处优，把满族人那点进取性全消磨尽了。尤其是娇惯子弟，使他们在满清覆亡时竟连谋生之道也不会，成了最无用的一批人。然而，这悲剧不是他们个人造成的，而是历史使然。他们之中的大多数人往往很善良，有些人还很聪明。因此，邓友梅在作品中除讽刺那种苟且偷安的典型外，还对他们寄予了同情，客观地刻画他们是“办好事没能耐，做坏事本事也不到家”一类人。
    邓友梅对旗人的认识和描写，得到了旗人普遍的肯定。《烟壶》在北京晚报连载后，末代皇帝溥仪的胞弟溥杰欣然手书“京风民俗”的条幅赠予邓友梅，题头上还称《烟壶》稗史，纸贵洛阳，良有以也”，可见褒奖有加。《那五》电视剧筹拍消息传开后，著名歌唱家胡松华主动自荐要为该剧唱主题歌。原来，胡氏也是“在旗”，而且还是“禳黄旗”。
