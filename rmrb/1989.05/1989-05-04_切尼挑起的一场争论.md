	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 30th

	U.S. Secretary of Defense Cheney said on April 29th in a televised interview that he believed Gorbachev "will ultimately fail," and "if this happens, he will be replaced by someone even less friendly." Cheney's remarks caused a stir in Washington, prompting a senior White House aide to quickly come out the next day and state, "This is not the president's view." President Bush then, in an address to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, expressed his belief that Gorbachev's reform movement would "continue." He further stated, "During my meeting with Gorbachev in New York, I clearly told him that we hope to see the success of Soviet reforms." By this point, the president's stance had been made clear, and the matter could be considered settled.

	However, this incident shows that the U.S. government has not yet reached a consensus on how to express its assessment of the Soviet Union. As a senior official from the White House National Security Council put it, Cheney's remarks "reflect the views commonly held by government decision-makers," but it was "unwise" of him to make such statements publicly.

	The debate over whether Gorbachev's domestic reforms will succeed has become a topic of interest in the West. The conclusions are essentially twofold: one side believes success is possible, the other believes failure is possible. If successful, two possible outcomes for U.S.-Soviet relations emerge: one is further easing of tensions, the other is a more assertive Soviet Union leading to renewed tensions. Both scenarios could have different impacts on U.S.-Soviet relations. So far, the discussion has not gone beyond this framework. Who is right and who is wrong remains to be seen as events unfold.

	However, it is precisely this uncertain situation that has given Western countries the freedom to adjust their policies towards the Soviet Union according to their national interests. The U.S. can no longer simply use the threat of the Soviet Union to constrain its allies' relations with the Soviet Union. West Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain, and other countries have differing views from the U.S. and the UK on the modernization of short-range missiles, which is a product of different assessments of the Soviet Union combined with national interests, causing headaches for the U.S.

	As the U.S. Secretary of Defense, Cheney is particularly concerned about the fissures that have emerged within NATO and hopes to use his remarks to align the allies with the U.S. stance. President Bush, on the other hand, emphasizes the consistency of U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union from a broader perspective of U.S.-Soviet relations. The Bush administration's policy towards the Soviet Union is largely a continuation of the policy of both confrontation and dialogue adopted by the Reagan administration in its later years. If Cheney's assessment is accepted, U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union would need significant adjustments, causing great turmoil in international politics and relations. This is something that President Bush, who has just cautiously and steadily passed the 100-day mark of his administration, is keen to avoid.

	However, it can also be seen from this that the long-standing U.S.-Soviet relationship is still far from truly thawing.

### 切尼挑起的一场争论

　　切尼挑起的一场争论
    塞北
    美国国防部长切尼４月２９日在向电视记者发表谈话时说，他认为，戈尔巴乔夫“最终将会失败”，“如果发生这种情况，他将由一个更不友善的人取代”。切尼这番话在华盛顿引起了一阵混乱，以致白宫的一名高级助手在第二天立即出来声明，说“这不是总统的看法”。布什总统接着在向美国商会讲话时表示，他认为戈尔巴乔夫的改革运动会“继续下去”。他进一步说，“我和戈尔巴乔夫在纽约会谈时曾向他明确表示，我们希望看到苏联改革的成功。”至此，总统的态度已经明确，事情可以了结了。
    不过这件事情表明，美国官方对于如何表述对苏联的估计还没有一个一致的口径。正如白宫国家安全委员会一位高级官员所说的，切尼的话“反映了政府决策者们普遍持有的看法”，只是他公开这样说，那是“不明智的”。
    探讨戈尔巴乔夫在国内实行的改革能否成功，这在西方似乎已经成为一门学问。结论无非两种，一种认为可能成功，一种认为可能失败。如果成功，可能在美苏关系上出现两种前途，一种是美苏关系进一步缓和，另一种是苏联在国力增强以后更加咄咄逼人，美苏关系重新紧张。这两种前景对美苏关系都可能产生不同的影响。迄今为止，讨论基本没有跳出这个框框。谁是谁非，也都有待事态的发展来加以证明。
    但是正是这种捉摸不定的状况，使得西方各国获得了按照本国利益调整对苏政策的自由，因为美国再也不能简单地用苏联威胁这几个字来约束盟国的对苏关系。西德、比利时、丹麦、希腊、意大利、挪威、西班牙等一批国家在短导现代化问题上同美、英持不同意见，就是对苏联的不同估计同本国利益结合的产物，给美国带来了令人头痛的问题。
    切尼作为美国国防部长，十分关心北约集团已经显露的裂痕，希望用他的讲话来使盟国同美国步调一致。而作为总统的布什，则从更大的美苏关系的范围来表明对苏政策的前后一致。布什政府的对苏政策，基本上师承里根总统后期的对苏既对抗又对话的政策。如果同意切尼的估计，对苏政策就需要作出重大调整，在国际政治和国际关系中引起极大的混乱。这是刚刚谨慎踏实地走过了执政百日大关的布什总统所极不希望的。
    只是从这里也可以看出，非一日之寒的美苏关系，离真正解冻还早。
