Since the beginning of spring, diseases have been spreading. However, many townships and village clinics in Xianfeng County are out of stock of commonly used medications such as pain relievers, phenacetin, and aspirin. Doctors are helpless, and farmers are suffering.

The epidemic prevention department predicts that the county may experience a widespread outbreak of influenza and meningitis this year. However, antibiotics and amine-based drugs for prevention and treatment are severely lacking. The county pharmaceutical company has run out of Gentamicin, Rifampicin, and Rifampin, and there are very few stocks of Penicillin, Phenacetin, and Aspirin, which must be rationed. The company's responsible person said that this situation will only get worse. Moreover, due to the combination of drugs, the pharmaceutical company and various levels of hospitals are facing cash flow problems. A small county company alone has accumulated a backlog of tonic drugs worth 100,000 yuan. In primary hospitals, tonic drugs like ginseng and royal jelly are abundant, but drugs for treating diseases are in short supply. We appeal to the newspaper: the people in the mountainous areas are waiting for medicine to treat their illnesses!

　　山区严重缺药
    入春以来，疾病流行。可是，咸丰县多数乡、村卫生院的去痛片、安乃近、阿斯匹林等常用治疗药品已经无货。医生无奈，农民叫苦。
    防疫部门预测，我县今年可能出现流感和流脑的大流行。而用于防治的抗菌消炎和?胺类药品严重缺乏。县医药公司的庆大霉素、利福平、利福定等药品已经断档，青霉素、安乃近、阿斯匹林等库存极少，不得不控制使用。公司负责人说，这种情况还会越来越严重。而且，因药品搭配，造成医药公司和各级医院资金周转不灵，仅一个小县公司就积压滋补药品金额达１０万元。基层医院里也是人参蜂皇浆一类滋补药品充斥，用于治病的药物却非常紧张，请报纸为我们呼吁：山区人民等药治病！
