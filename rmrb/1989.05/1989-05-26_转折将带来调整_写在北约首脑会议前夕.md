A Shift Will Bring Adjustments

—Written on the Eve of the NATO Summit

By Wei Wei, Our Correspondent

Now, there are only four days left until the NATO summit. The allied countries on both sides of the Atlantic are hurriedly preparing and frequently consulting to bridge differences and maintain at least a superficial unity when the 16 heads of state gather.

From recent developments, it appears that Washington and Bonn are moving closer to each other, increasing the hope for a compromise. The United States has shown a flexible attitude and no longer firmly opposes negotiations with the Warsaw Pact on short-range missiles. However, the United States has a precondition: only after making "irreversible" progress in conventional force negotiations will it consider it. West Germany has also abandoned its proposal to negotiate with the Warsaw Pact on the issue of reducing and ultimately eliminating short-range missiles "as soon as possible," supporting the U.S. suggestion to "link" negotiations on conventional forces and short-range missiles. Analysts here believe that formulating a political declaration that everyone can accept should not be too difficult. After all, in the various "declarations" or "statements" issued by NATO over the past one or two years, whenever internal disputes are involved, they have always been vague, allowing different parties with differing opinions to find interpretations favorable to themselves.

However, even if a face-saving compromise plan is worked out and a "happy ending" atmosphere is created, it will not eliminate the deep-seated differences within NATO. The series of disputes over whether short-range nuclear weapons should be modernized and whether negotiations should be held with the Soviet Union will not subside. The related "overall concept" debate will not stop either. The main significance of this summit is not to celebrate the past but to deal with the new situation of a major shift in East-West relations and to begin strategic adjustments.

West Germany's public confrontation with the United States on the short-range missile issue is unprecedented in the history of NATO's internal relations, and other Western European countries have gradually adopted a supportive stance towards West Germany. This trend reflects a major change in NATO's internal relations. West Germany, especially as the economic backbone of the European Community and a major player in world trade, is beginning to change its dependent status in Western politics and defense from a geopolitical perspective, and its sense of autonomy is becoming more pronounced. A NATO analyst believes that it is somewhat absurd and unrealistic to say that Europe is now vying with the United States for leadership and seeking autonomy in defense, but in matters affecting its own interests, it is seeking greater influence, gradually establishing a more equal basis for relations between allies on both sides of the Atlantic. The United States' concession on short-range missile negotiations is a manifestation of this adjustment trend.

For forty years, NATO has pursued a "deterrence strategy," with various nuclear weapons as the main means of deterrence. Now, the deterrence theory is increasingly being doubted by the public in Western Europe. This change forces Western strategists to consider modifying NATO's strategy. A NATO official believes that the strategy needed now should be "minimum deterrence, maximum cooperation." NATO's military functions should be reduced and reduced, and it should play an increasingly important role in strengthening East-West "cooperation." NATO will gradually dilute its military consciousness and adapt to the situation of becoming a platform for East-West dialogue, opening up various channels for political and security cooperation.

Of course, the adjustment of NATO's strategy is a "flexible, cautious, and gradual process," not only constrained by internal disagreements but also, to a large extent, by the development of the situation in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This is a long, tortuous, and even painful journey. This NATO summit can at most only hint at the intention of adjustment. However, as long as the world shifts from a bipolar to a multipolar direction, NATO will undoubtedly continue to adjust its internal relations and external strategies, expanding dialogue and cooperation with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. This adjustment will develop in the direction of breaking through the "Yalta system" established after World War II.

In this sense, the upcoming NATO summit may be recorded in NATO history as an important meeting that marks a significant adjustment in NATO's strategy, continuing the past and opening the future.

### 转折将带来调整——写在北约首脑会议前夕

　　转折将带来调整
    ——写在北约首脑会议前夕
    本报记者  魏崴
    现在，离北约首脑会议只剩４天了。大西洋两岸的盟国，正加紧准备，频繁磋商，以期弥合分歧，使１６国首脑相聚时至少能维持表面的团结。
    从最近几天的情况看，华盛顿与波恩的立场正相互靠拢，谋求妥协方案的希望在增大。美国已表现出灵活姿态，不再坚持反对与华约举行短导谈判了，但是美国有一个先决条件，即在常规力量谈判取得“不可逆转的”进展后，才能考虑。西德也放弃了“尽快”就削减并最后消除短导问题与华约谈判的主张，赞同美国关于将常规力量和短导的谈判“相互挂钩”的建议。此间分析家认为，形成一个大家都能接受的“政治宣言”，该不会是十分困难的事。何况近一两年来，在北约的各类“宣言”或“公报”中，凡涉及内部争执之处，历来都是含糊其辞的，不同意见的诸方都可从中找到有利于自己的解释。
    不过，即使搞出一个保全面子的妥协方案，创造一个“皆大欢喜”的气氛来，也不能消除北约内部的深刻分歧，短程核武器要不要现代化，要不要与苏联谈判的一系列争执并不会就此平息，同这些争执紧密相关的“整体构想”之争亦不会停止。此次首脑会议的主要意义，不是庆祝过去，而是为了应付东西方关系出现大转折的新局面，着手战略调整。
    西德在短导问题上与美国公开顶撞，态度之强硬在北约内部关系史上是没有先例的，而且西欧其它一些国家，也逐渐采取支持西德的立场。这种动向反映出北约内部关系业已发生了重大变化。西欧尤其是西德在北约内的地位正在加强。作为欧洲共同体的经济中坚，世界贸易中的强国，西德从地缘政治的利害出发，开始在西方政治和防务方面，改变仰人鼻息的状况，自主意识明显增强。北约的一位分析家认为，要说现在欧洲同美国争夺领导权，谋求防务上的自主，未免近于荒唐，很不现实，但是在涉及自身利益时争取更大发言权，使大西洋两岸的盟国关系逐渐建立在更加平等的基础上，则是大势所趋。美国不得不在短导谈判上作出让步，正是这一调整趋势的表现。
    四十年来，北约奉行的是“威慑战略”，各类核武器是威慑的主要手段。而今，威慑论在西欧公众中越来越受到怀疑。这种变化迫使西方战略家不得不考虑修改北约战略。一位北约人士认为，现在需要的战略，应是“最小限度的威慑，最大限度的合作”。北约的军事职能，应减小再减小，在加强东西方“合作”方面则应发挥越来越大的作用。北约将逐步淡化军事意识，而应一步步适应其成为东西欧对话讲坛的形势，开辟政治、安全合作的各类渠道。
    当然，北约战略的调整，是一个“灵活、谨慎的渐变过程”，不但受内部分歧制约，而且在很大程度还将受苏联和东欧局势发展的制约。这是一个漫长、曲折甚至是痛苦的跋涉过程。此次北约首脑会议，至多只能略表调整的意向。但是，只要世界从两极向多极化方向转变，北约肯定会不断调整内部关系和对外战略，扩大与苏联、东欧的对话与合作，这种调整，就会朝着冲破第二次世界大战后确立的“雅尔塔格局”的方向发展下去。
    由此观之，即将召开的北约首脑会议，有可能作为继往开来，标志着北约战略调整的一次重要会议而载入北约史册。
