A band consisting of five foreigners has been frequently performing in Shanghai's hotels and universities over the past few months, adding a lively atmosphere to Shanghai's nightlife.

These five "foreigners" are all American employees of foreign companies based in Shanghai. A few months ago, they met and decided to form a band. Since the band was organized purely for their own entertainment, they named it the "In-House Band." However, as their reputation spread, various foreign institutions in Shanghai, Sino-foreign joint ventures, and foreign students at universities began inviting them to perform. The "In-House Band" thus started appearing in public venues.
