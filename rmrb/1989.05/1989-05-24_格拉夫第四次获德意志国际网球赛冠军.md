Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 22nd.

The 82nd Deutsche Open Women's Tennis Tournament concluded on May 21st in West Berlin. The world's top-ranked player and West German star, Steffi Graf, won her fourth consecutive title. She defeated Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini, the world's third-ranked player, with a score of 6-3 and 6-1 in the final.

Graf has a particular fondness for this venue because four years ago, she made her first victory against the then-top-ranked player, breaking Martina Navratilova's "unbeatable" legend and laying a solid foundation for her later ascent to the throne of the women's tennis world.

In this tournament, Navratilova, due to her recent poor performance on clay courts, withdrew at the last moment. However, Gabriela Sabatini, who has been rising rapidly in recent years and has become Graf's main rival, participated for the first time, making the Graf-Sabatini final a highly anticipated match.

The match unfolded as expected. Graf and Sabatini both advanced through the earlier rounds, finally meeting in today's final. However, Graf, with her superior skills and psychological advantage, took the lead from the start. Sabatini, on the other hand, made many uncharacteristic errors and fell behind. In the end, Graf won with a score of 6-3 and 6-1.

So far, Graf and Sabatini have faced each other 19 times, with Graf losing only 3 matches, all of which occurred since 1988. This indicates that their strengths are becoming increasingly close, and a more balanced competitive landscape is emerging. Graf and Sabatini are set to become the new focal point of women's tennis, following in the footsteps of Navratilova and Chris Evert.

　　格拉夫第四次获德意志国际网球赛冠军
    新华社波恩５月２２日电  第八十二届德意志国际女子网球赛２１日在西柏林结束，世界头号种子选手、西德名将施特菲·格拉夫连续第四次夺得冠军。她在决赛中以６∶３和６∶１战胜了阿根廷选手、世界第三号种子加夫列尔·萨瓦蒂尼。
    格拉夫对这一比赛场地有特别的好感，因为在四年前，她就是在这里首次战胜了当时的头号种子选手，打破了娜芙拉蒂洛娃“不可战胜”的神话，并为后来荣登网坛“女皇”宝座奠定了坚实的基础。
    在本届比赛中，娜芙拉蒂洛娃因最近在沙地网球场战绩不佳，在最后时刻宣布退出这场比赛，而近年成绩迅速上升，并成为施特菲·格拉夫的主要对手的加夫列尔·萨瓦蒂尼却第一次加入了这一比赛，因此格拉夫—萨瓦蒂尼的决战成为人们预想中的决赛。
    比赛如人们期望的一样进行。格拉夫和萨瓦蒂尼在前几轮过关斩将，最后终于在今天决赛中相遇。但格拉夫毕竟技高一筹，在心理上又占有优势，所以比赛开始就稍占主动，而萨瓦蒂尼却出现了许多不应有的失误，处于下风。最后，格拉夫终以６∶３和６∶１轻取萨瓦蒂尼。
    到现在为止，格拉夫与萨瓦蒂尼交战１９场，格拉夫只败过３场，但３场比赛都是在１９８８年以来输的。这说明，双方的实力正在日益接近，互有胜负的局面将取代“一边倒”。格拉夫和萨瓦蒂尼这一对对手将成为继娜芙拉蒂洛娃—埃弗特之后女子网坛新的话题。
