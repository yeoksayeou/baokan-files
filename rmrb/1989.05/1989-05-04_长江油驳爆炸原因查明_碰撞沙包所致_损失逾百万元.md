The cause of the Yangtze River oil barge explosion has been identified as a collision with sandbags, resulting in over 10 million yuan in losses.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 4th – (Correspondents Liu Jun and Ji Zuo Nian) The cause of the oil barge explosion that occurred on January 2nd in the new rapids section of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province has been determined. The direct cause of this major accident was the collision of the Yangtze 62008 oil barge convoy with sandbags in the navigation channel. Vice Minister of Communications Lin Zuyi announced this conclusion at a safety meeting held in Nanjing recently.

At 1:15 AM on January 2nd, the Yangtze 62008 oil barge convoy of the Nanjing Yangtze River Oil Transportation Company, en route from Nanjing to Linxiang in Hunan Province, suddenly exploded and caught fire in the waters near the new rapids section of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province, resulting in direct economic losses of over 10 million yuan.

Following the accident, the State Council organized relevant ministries and commissions, along with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, to form a joint investigation team. After three months of investigation and analysis, it was determined that the direct cause of this major accident was the collision of the oil barge convoy with an unnoticed, irregularly shaped sandbag in the navigation channel. This collision caused the convoy to run aground, break its ropes, disperse, and collide with each other, resulting in sparks that ignited the flammable gases in the oil tanks, leading to the explosion and fire.

　　长江油驳爆炸原因查明    
    碰撞沙包所致　损失逾百万元
    新华社武汉５月４日电  （通讯员刘军、计祖年）今年１月２日发生在湖北长江新滩口的油驳爆炸事故原因现已查明，这次重大事故的直接原因是由于长江６２００８号顶推油驳船队在航道中碰到了沙包所造成的。交通部副部长林祖乙日前在南京召开的安全办公会议上宣布了这一结论。
    １月２日凌晨１时１５分，由南京驶往湖南临湘的南京长江油运公司长江６２００８油驳船队，在湖北洪湖新滩口江面上突然爆炸起火，直接经济损失１００多万元。
    事故发生后，国务院组织有关部委和全国总工会成立联合调查组，经过三个月的调查分析，查明了此次重大事故的直接原因是这支顶推油驳船队在航道中碰到不易发现的不规则沙包，造成船队搁浅、断缆、散队和相互碰撞，产生的火花与油舱内可燃气体相遇爆炸起火。
