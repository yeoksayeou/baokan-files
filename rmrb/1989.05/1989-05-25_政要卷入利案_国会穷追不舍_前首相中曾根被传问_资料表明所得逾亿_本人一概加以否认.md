Politicians Involved in Scandal, Parliament Pursues Relentlessly
Former Prime Minister Nakasone Questioned
Documents Show Earnings Exceed 100 Million Yen, Denied by Himself

Our reporter Yu Qing reports from Tokyo: Today afternoon, former Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro was summoned to the House of Representatives Budget Committee to testify regarding his involvement in the Recruit stock scandal.

The questioning lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes. Committee Chairman Oono Akira and representatives from opposition parties took turns questioning Nakasone. Documents submitted by Nakasone indicate that Recruit Company provided political donations and stock trading profits to Nakasone's side, totaling 109.60 million yen. Nakasone denied any personal involvement in the scandal. Regarding political and moral responsibility, Nakasone stated that the stock scandal occurred during his tenure as cabinet minister, which he deeply regrets and apologizes to the nation. He expressed no intention to resign from his parliamentary seat.

Our reporter reports from Tokyo: Today morning, Japanese Cabinet Justice Minister Takatsuki Masami and the Director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Justice submitted an interim report on the Recruit scandal investigation to the parliament.

The Justice Minister stated that the investigation is nearing completion and that a final conclusion will be presented soon. Apart from known facts, the interim report did not propose any new plans. Regarding the 11 parliamentarians involved in the scandal, there was no mention.

According to reports, a group of approximately 30 lawyers, the "Recruit Osaka Lawyers' Association," sent a letter to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office today, demanding a thorough investigation and prosecution of politicians involved in the scandal, including former Prime Minister Nakasone.

The letter emphasized that politicians in positions of power should not be spared. A thorough investigation should be conducted, and severe penalties should be imposed on those found guilty of illegal activities.

　　政要卷入利案　国会穷追不舍
    前首相中曾根被传问
    资料表明所得逾亿　本人一概加以否认
    本报东京５月２５日电  记者于青报道：今天下午，日本国会传问前首相中曾根康弘，让他在众院预算委员会作证，就牵连利库路特股票丑闻问题，回答质询。
    传问进行了２小时４０分钟，众院预算委员会委员长大野明和各在野党代表先后质询。中曾根提交的资料表明，利库路特公司向中曾根方面提供的政治捐款和股票交易所得，总额为１．０９６０亿日元。对自身牵连利案的问题，中曾根一概否认。关于政治和道义的责任问题，中曾根表示，（股票丑闻）是在自己担任内阁负责人期间发生的不幸事件，不胜惭愧，向国民谢罪。他表示无意辞去议员。
    本报东京５月２５日电　今天上午，日本内阁法务大臣高辻正己和法务省刑事局长，向国会提交了搜查利库路特事件中间报告。
    法务大臣说，搜查工作接近完成，近期内还将提出最终结论。除已知的事实外，中间报告没有提出新的打算。对人们关注的１１名牵连利案的国会议员，只字未提。
    据报道，由约３０多名律师组成的“思考利库路特大阪律师会”，今天向东京地方检察厅寄送了要求彻底追究包括前首相中曾根等牵连利案政治家的意见书。
    意见书强调，对于位居权力中枢的政治家，不应该有顾虑。要在彻底搜查基础上，对违法行为给予严厉处罚。
