In the evening, it suddenly began to snow, and we couldn't help but worry. If the snow continued, the mountain would be sealed off, and we might not be able to visit Heavenly Lake the next day. Unexpectedly, by dawn, the snow had stopped. Strange! Once the snow stopped, the sky was filled with stars. Early in the morning, we rushed to the Great Western Gate, just as it was getting light, and the red sun began to rise.

Around eight o'clock, the car heading to Heavenly Lake started. We drove north along a paved road. Among the tourists, there were a few foreigners. One of them had silver hair and was carrying a collapsible bicycle. I was puzzled, wondering if one could ride a bike on the mountain? At nine o'clock, we passed Mi Spring. At ten o'clock, we entered Fukang. Once we entered Fukang County, the car drove along the foot of Tian Shan. At first, it was quite ordinary. There were rivers, trees, grasslands, cows, sheep, and white yurts where nomads lived. But as we ascended the mountain, there was nothing but steep cliffs and the winding road that snaked upwards. The higher we went, the more treacherous and rugged the mountains became, and the road grew more mysterious. Soon, we saw snow, which grew thicker. The driver had to slow down. As we neared the end, a group of towering snow-capped peaks suddenly loomed over us. Taking a closer look, it was awe-inspiring! A vast expanse of white, with towering peaks reaching towards the sky. At that moment, I thought of Cai Dongfan's "Tang Dynasty Chronicles" and the story of Xue Rengui's "Three Arrows to Conquer Tian Shan." However, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't imagine how ancient warriors fought on this magnificent Tian Shan. Unfortunately, Cai Dongfan did not elaborate on this.

At noon, the car stopped, and we rested on a natural grassy area. It was very quiet around us. The dark green forest hid a few red small buildings. As soon as we got off the car, I was still wondering, where is the water? Where is Heavenly Lake? However, after walking across the grassy area, Heavenly Lake came into full view. At that moment, I felt a sudden brightness before my eyes. In the valley surrounded by snow-capped peaks, a pool of clear blue water suddenly appeared. What clear water! The lake breeze blew, moistening my heart and lungs. Before taking a step, I was already intoxicated. Later, walking along the riverbank, the sky was blue, and the trees were even greener. The distant snow-capped peaks seemed to come closer. Even the sky seemed within reach. At this point, I felt as if I had entered a fairyland. My heart was floating, and my spirit was bewildered, with a feeling of wanting to fly away. Unfortunately, it was already cold, and all the boats along the shore were stored away. Otherwise, drifting on the lake would have been even more enjoyable.

This is the legendary Heavenly Lake. People say that the Queen Mother of the West once held a peach banquet here.

In fact, this Heavenly Lake is just a few dozen square miles of water, but because it is located on Tian Shan, it cannot help but be called a wonder. Such a magnificent mountain, how could it hold water? And not just a small stream. Therefore, anyone who comes to Xinjiang usually wants to see the wonder of Heavenly Lake, and there is even a saying that if you don't visit Heavenly Lake, it's like you never came. Of course, most visitors come here just to see Heavenly Lake. Only those who are not afraid of danger will climb the snow-capped peaks. The elderly person from a foreign country who came with us is one of them. When we returned to the grassy area, he was practicing his cycling, preparing to climb the peak the next day. This could not help but make me admire him.

As for us, we can only say that we did not come in vain.

　　上天池
    郎澜
    晚间，突然飘下雨雪，我们不免有些担忧，这雪一下，怕是要封山了，明日我们还能上天池吗？不想天未破晓，雪已停住。奇了！雪一住，满天皆是星斗。清晨我们奔至大西门，刚好大亮，红红的朝阳冉冉升起。
    约八时，开往天池的车方启动，沿一条柏油大道向北驶去。游客间，坐有几位外国人。就中一个满头银发，身边携带着辆轻便组合的脚踏车。我直纳闷，难道山上还用得着骑车吗？九时，过米泉。十时，入阜康。一进阜康县境，车便驰在天山脚下了。开头，也平常。山脚处有河流，有树木、草地、牛羊和一顶顶牧民居住的白色毡房。但是一上山，什么也没有了，只看到笔陡的山岩，以及不时往上盘旋的公路。愈向上，山势愈险峻愈奇突，道也愈发玄。不久，可见雪，越来越厚。司机不得不减速了。将及终点，一群突兀的雪峰，忽地压将下去。定眼一瞧，好气势！白茫茫的一片，突起的峰峦几与天齐。顿时，我想蔡东藩著《唐史演义》薛仁贵征西“三箭定天山”的气势。然而无论如何我却想象不出，在这雄奇的天山上，古人究竟是怎样厮杀的唻？可惜，蔡公未有细言。
    正午，车停住，歇在一方天然草坪上。四周静极了。墨绿的树林中，掩着几幢红色的小楼。刚下车，我心里还嘀咕，怎不见水呀，天池在哪儿呢？然而走过那方草坪，天池便尽收眼底。那当儿，不觉得眼前豁然一亮，雪峰环抱的山坳间，突地推出一池碧绿的清水。好清好清的水！池风涌来，直润心肺。未移步，已自醉了。过后，沿河岸步去，看天天亦蓝，看林林更绿。远近的雪峰都走来了。甚至，天亦可摸。至此，几入仙境。晃悠悠心荡神迷，大有飘飘欲仙之态。可惜天已冷了，沿岸的游艇统统封存。否则在池中荡漾一番，岂不更生情趣？
    这便是传说中的瑶池了。人们都说，那年王母娘娘就在此召开过蟠桃盛会。
    其实这天池，也就是方圆几十里地的水，但它座落于天山之上，这就不能不称之为奇呢。那么雄奇的山，上边怎么会搁住水呢？而且不是一条小小的溪流。因此大凡到新疆的人，总是要一睹天池的奇景，也就有不到天池，等于白来之说。当然游人到此，大多是看看天池罢了。唯有那不畏艰险的人，才去攀雪峰。与我们同来的那位来自异国的长者，就是这其中一个。当我们返回草坪时，他正在蹬车练脚功，准备次日登峰。这不能不令我敬佩。
    至于我们，只能说是没有“白来”。
