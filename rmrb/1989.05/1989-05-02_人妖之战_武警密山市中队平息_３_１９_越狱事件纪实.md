The Battle of Man and Demon

— The Story of the Wuhan Police Subunit's Suppression of the "3.19" Prison Escape Incident

March 19, a Sunday.

In the morning, the bright sunlight kissed the city of Mishan in Heilongjiang Province, making everything seem harmonious and peaceful.

However, hidden within this tranquility was a sinister plot. At around 9:30 AM, four serious criminals took advantage of their time outdoors to stage a vicious incident where they killed a prison guard and attempted to escape. Facing these ruthless criminals, the officers and soldiers of the Mishan City Public Security Subunit remained fearless and engaged in a life-or-death struggle against the criminals.

In the corner of the west side of the hallway of the second cell in the Mishan Detention Center, a tall, muscular, and evil-looking prisoner was resting with his eyes closed. He was Jia Yujian, the leader of a major theft gang from the 857 Farm of the Agricultural Reclamation Bureau. After being caught, he knew he had committed many crimes and would face severe punishment, always plotting how to escape. In November 1988, during a cell adjustment, Jia Yujian was moved to the third cell. Not long after, Jia Yujian, with a criminal's instinct, targeted Du Lifu, a masked robber and rapist. At the same time, he used a single-line contact method to collude with Li Xiuguang, a gambler and bomber, and Zhao Min, a car thief, planning to kill and escape on a Sunday.

On the morning of March 19, 27-year-old prison guard Wang Zuoqian, dressed neatly, bid farewell to his wife and daughter and arrived at the detention center on time to start his shift.

At the entrance of the detention center, Public Security soldiers Zhou Quan, Wang Fuliang, and Wang Dong stood guard with their guns, vigilantly watching the prisoners who were out for exercise.

Accompanied by the clanging of shackles, the prisoners from the third cell stepped out of the hallway and lined up to go to the toilet.

This day was the day Du Lifu and Jia Yujian had been planning for a long time.

As they walked out of the cell, Du Lifu lightly nudged Jia Yujian and whispered, "Let's do it."

When they came out of the toilet and lined up, the four escapees all stood at the back. Since the formation was usually random, no one suspected any plot. At this moment, Jia Yujian ordered Li Xiuguang again:

"No matter what happens, you must not look back. First, lock those people (referring to the other prisoners in the same cell) back in the cell."

Li Xiuguang and Zhao Min both heard Jia Yujian's instructions.

Prison guard Wang Zuoqian was counting the prisoners entering the cell from a point one meter west of the hallway door.

Jia Yujian, Du Lifu, and Zhao Min unconsciously increased the distance between them and the prisoners in front.

Just as the criminals stepped into the hallway, Du Lifu and Jia Yujian pounced on prison guard Wang Zuoqian like wolves, knocking him unconscious. At this moment, Li Xiuguang, who was walking in front, herded the other prisoners back into the cell and immediately locked the door, returning to the doorway. Jia Yujian quickly disconnected all the alarm wires, grabbed a set of keys from Wang Zuoqian's body, and rushed towards the west small door, attempting to open it and escape. However, the door did not open. Seeing that their plot was about to be exposed and the guards would soon react, Jia Yujian immediately ran back to the doorway and hid with Du Lifu on either side of the door, ordering Li Xiuguang to lure the guards into the hallway, intending to kill and seize their guns.

Li Xiuguang stuck his head out and then half of his body out, shouting to the soldiers on duty, "Something's wrong inside, you guys come and see!"

Hearing the faint noises from the cell and Li Xiuguang's shouts, the three soldiers became alert. New soldier Wang Fuliang, following the regulation that weapons should not be carried near prisoners, handed his gun to the acting squad leader Zhou Quan and cautiously approached the cell door. Just as he stepped onto the platform, preparing to enter the hallway, Du Lifu and Jia Yujian lunged at him. Wang Fuliang was agile and quickly jumped back, swinging his right arm to break free from the two criminals' grip on his collar, turning his body along the wall and quickly running towards Wang Dong and Zhou Quan, shouting, "The prison is under attack! The prison is under attack!"

Seeing that their escape plan was about to fail, Jia Yujian and Du Lifu, dragging their shackles, jumped and pursued Wang Fuliang, intending to capture a hostage for their last struggle.

Wang Dong and Zhou Quan, standing at the guard post, witnessed this scene nearby, remaining calm and composed. They shouted loudly:

"Halt!" "Halt, or we'll shoot!"

The verbal warning was ineffective.

Wang Dong and Zhou Quan raised their submachine guns, and with a burst of gunfire, a series of bullets shot into the air.

Jia Yujian screamed madly, "Shoot! Shoot at me!"

The warning shots were also ineffective.

The two criminals were only seven or eight meters away from the guards. Wang Dong decided quickly and fired at Du Lifu first. The bullets of hatred pierced Du Lifu's calf, and he fell to the ground.

Zhou Quan fired a shot at Jia Yujian, but unfortunately, the gun barrel deviated, and he missed. In a critical moment, Wang Dong, while firing at Du Lifu, shouted to Zhou Quan, "Quick, switch to single shot!" These words reminded Zhou Quan. He raised the gun barrel with his left hand, and with his right hand, he switched the fire selector to single shot, killing Jia Yujian on the spot with one shot.

The gunshots alerted the officers and soldiers who were resting. The acting deputy squad leader Liu Yunping immediately blew the emergency assembly whistle and issued the action command.

The soldiers, like little tigers out of the mountains, were dressed and armed in just one minute, occupying the high ground and sealing all exits of the prison. At this time, Wang Fuliang, Wang Dong, and Zhou Quan had also retreated to the outside of the main gate, fully focused on the movements in the cell.

Liu Yunping ordered Zhou Quan to shout at the criminals, commanding them to bring out Wang Zuoqian, who was still in the cell. After a series of shouts, Li Xiuguang and Zhao Min, who were frightened by the gunshots and confused, seemed to regain their composure. They mixed in with the prisoners carrying Wang Zuoqian, deliberately slowing down, still attempting to seize the soldiers' guns when they approached. Their ugly faces did not deceive Liu Yunping's sharp eyes. Liu Yunping raised his hand and fired a shot, ordering the prisoners to place Wang Zuoqian on the steps and retreat back into the cell. Immediately, Liu Yunping led two soldiers under fire cover and quickly rescued prison guard Wang Zuoqian, rushing him to the hospital in an ambulance.

After Wang Zuoqian was rescued from the cell, how many prisoners were involved in the escape riot? No one knew at the time.

The city's Public Security Bureau chief Gao Shouguang led a team to bandage and rescue the dying Du Lifu, conducting an urgent interrogation. Du Lifu confessed to all his crimes before dying at 6:19 PM.

Unfortunately, prison guard Wang Zuoqian died from his injuries after 13 days of rescue efforts, ending his 27-year journey through life.

　　人妖之战   
    ——武警密山市中队平息“３·１９”越狱事件纪实
    ３月１９日，星期天。
    清晨，明媚的阳光亲吻着黑龙江省密山市，一切都显得那么和谐、平静。
    然而，就在这平静之中，却隐藏着一个恶毒的阴谋，上午９点多钟，４名重刑犯人利用放风之机制造了一起杀害管教员，企图强行越狱的恶性事件。面对穷凶极恶的暴徒，密山市武警中队的干部战士临危不惧，同罪犯展开了一场正义与邪恶的殊死较量。
    密山看守所走廊西侧的第二号监室的墙角，一个身高１．８３米、膀阔腰圆、面目凶恶的囚徒在闭目养神，他就是农垦局八五七农场号称一霸的重大盗窃集团首犯贾玉建。落入法网之后，他深知罪恶多端，重刑难逃，时刻都在盘算着怎样逃跑。１９８８年１１月，在监号调整时，贾玉建来到了第三监号。时间不长，贾玉建就凭一个罪犯的感觉，本能地盯上了蒙面抢劫、强奸犯杜立富。同时，采取单线联系的方法，由贾玉建串通了赌博、爆炸犯李秀光、盗车犯赵敏，准备在星期天杀人越狱。
    ３月１９日早晨８点，２７岁的管教员王作强，穿着整齐地告别妻子和女儿，准时来到看守所接了班。
    在看守所的大门口，武警战士周权、王福连、王东持枪警惕地注视着正在放风的人犯。
    随着一阵叮叮当当的镣铐撞击声，第三监号的人犯迈出了走廊，排着队向厕所走去。
    这天，是杜立富、贾玉建等人早已琢磨良久的日子。
    走出监号的路上，杜立富轻轻碰了贾玉建一下，悄声说：“干了。”
    从厕所出来排队时候，４名越狱犯都站在了最后面。因为平时队形都是随便排的，谁也没想到这里隐藏着阴谋。这时，贾玉建再次“命令”李秀光：
    “不管发生了什么事，你都不许回头，先把那些人（指同监室其他人犯）关进号里。”
    李秀光、赵敏同时听到了贾玉建的吩咐。
    管教员王作强在距离走廊大门西侧一米的地方清点入监人犯。
    贾玉建、杜立富、赵敏不约而同与前面的人犯拉开了距离。
    就在几个罪犯跨进走廊的一瞬间，杜立富、贾玉建恶狼般地扑向管教员王作强，将他打昏。这时，走在前面的李秀光把其他人犯赶入监号，随即将门插上，返回门口。贾玉建顺手将报警电线全部拆断，手抄从王作强身上搜出的一串钥匙奔向西小门，企图打开小门脱身，门未能打开。此时，其他监号的人犯看到了眼前发生的惨景。他们敲打脸盆、撞门，高喊：“救命，救命。”贾玉建眼见阴谋即将败露，哨兵很快就会作出反应。他立即跑回门口和杜立富躲在门两侧，命令李秀光诱骗哨兵进走廊，妄图杀人抢枪。
    李秀光探出脑袋，然后伸出半个身子向正在执勤的几个战士呼喊：“不好了，里面打起来了，你们快来看看。”
    听到监号里隐隐约约的响动和李秀光的呼喊，３个战士警觉起来。新战士王福连按照不能带武器接近人犯的规定将枪交给代班员周权，自己警惕地来到监舍门前，就在他跨上台阶，准备迈进走廊的一刹那，杜立富、贾玉建呼的一声直向小王扑来，王福连机敏灵活，迅速一个后跃，抡起右臂一个下防迅速打开了抓住他前衣襟的两罪犯的手，侧过身沿着房根直向王东和周权快步跑去，边跑边喊：“炸狱了！炸狱了！”
    贾玉建、杜立富看到越狱计划就要破灭，拖着脚镣跳跃着向王福连穷追不舍，他们要抓住一个人质做最后的挣扎。
    正在哨位上的王东和周权，目睹近在咫尺的此情此景，镇定自若，两个人放声高喊：
    “站住！”“不站住开枪了！”
    口头警告无效。
    王东和周权端起冲锋枪，哒哒哒……一串子弹射向天空。
    贾玉建疯狂叫喊：“开枪吧，往身上打吧。”
    鸣枪警告也失去了作用。
    两个罪犯离哨兵仅剩下七八米的距离了。王东当机立断先向杜立富射击，仇恨的子弹射穿了杜犯的小腿，他一个跟头栽倒在地。
    周权先向贾玉建打了一个点射，可惜，枪口偏了，没有击中贾犯。在危机时刻，王东一边向杜立富射击，一边向周权猛喊“快，扣单发。”一句话提醒了周权，他左手抬高枪口，右手扳动快慢机，一枪将贾玉建当场击毙。
    枪声，惊动了正在休息的干部战士。值班的代理副中队长刘云平立即吹响紧急集合的哨声，发出了行动的命令。
    战士们个个如同出山的小老虎，着装、取枪仅一分钟就占领制高点，封锁了监狱的所有出口。这时的王福连、王东和周权也都撤到了大门外，全神贯注注视着监号的动静。
    刘云平让周权向罪犯喊话，命令罪犯将在监内的王作强送出来。一阵喊话之后，被枪声吓得不知所措的李秀光、赵敏二犯似乎清醒过来。他俩夹杂在抬着王作强的人犯中间，故意放慢速度，仍在企图等战士们接近时抢枪行凶。他们的狰狞面目未能骗过刘云平锐敏的眼睛。刘云平举手鸣枪，命令人犯把王作强放在台阶上全部退回监号。随即刘云平带着两名战士在火力掩护下快速将管教员王作强抢了出来，截车飞奔医院。
    管教员王作强被抢救出监号后，有多少人犯参与越狱暴乱？人们一时无法知晓。
    市公安局长高守光带领一个小组对奄奄一息的杜立富包扎抢救之后，进行了紧急突审，杜犯在下午６点１９分死前供出全部犯罪事实。
    不幸的是，管教员王作强因伤势过重，抢救１３天后，光荣献身，走完了他年仅２７岁的生命旅途。
