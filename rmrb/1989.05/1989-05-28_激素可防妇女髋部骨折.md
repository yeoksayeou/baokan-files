Recently, experts from the British Royal College of Physicians announced that postmenopausal women can adopt estrogen replacement therapy to prevent hip fractures.

Through long-term clinical observations and extensive research, experts have found that estrogen helps prevent the loss of calcium in bones. Around the age of 50, women's estrogen secretion decreases, leading to a rapid loss of calcium in bones, which can result in hip fractures. Over the past 20 years, due to changes in lifestyle and reduced physical activity, the number of elderly people suffering from hip fractures in Britain has nearly doubled. In England and Wales, there are over 40,000 hip fracture cases annually, with the majority being postmenopausal women.

Recently, Dr. John Cannis, a senior lecturer in human metabolism at the University of Sheffield, has repeatedly warned women who have undergone ovariectomies, as well as those who have experienced early menopause and have addictions to smoking and alcohol, to start estrogen replacement therapy early to prevent hip fractures. However, Sir Raymond Hoffenberg, President of the British Royal College of Physicians, believes that women with a family history of breast cancer should not undergo this new treatment to avoid the risk of inducing breast cancer. To prevent hip fractures, medical experts unanimously agree that middle-aged and elderly women should increase their physical activity and consume more calcium-rich foods such as milk, dairy products, dark green leafy vegetables, and canned fish with bones to supplement the calcium content in their bones.

　　激素可防妇女髋部骨折
    不久前，英国皇家医学会的专家们公布，绝经妇女可采用补充雌性激素疗法来预防髋部（组成骨盆的大骨）骨折。
    通过长期临床观察和大量研究，专家们发现，雌性激素有助于防止骨骼中钙质的损耗，而５０岁左右的妇女雌性激素的分泌又越来越少，造成骨骼内钙质迅速损耗，导致髋部骨折。在过去的２０年中，由于生活方式的改变和运动量的减少，英国老年人中髋部骨折患者几乎增加了两倍。在英格兰和威尔士，每年髋部骨折患者达４万余人，绝大多数是绝经后妇女。
    最近，谢菲尔德大学人体代谢专业高级讲师约翰·凯尼斯博士一再告诫那些做过卵巢摘除术，以及绝经期提前和烟酒成癖的妇女要及早进行雌性激素补充疗法，防止髋部骨折。但是，英国皇家医学会会长雷蒙德·霍芬伯格爵士认为，近亲中有患乳腺癌的妇女不宜接受这种新型疗法，以免诱发乳腺癌的危险。为避免髋部骨折，医学家们一致认为，中老年妇女应适当增加运动量，多食用牛奶、奶制品、深绿色叶蔬菜以及带骨头吃的鱼罐头等含钙食物，来补充骨骼中的钙质含量。
