Humans can live up to how many years? No one can say for sure. Ninety years ago, the average lifespan of Europeans was 45 years. Now, men over 80 and women over 90 are no longer rare. This fact proves that science can extend the journey of human life from birth to death.

According to the Dutch biologist Vigege, future generations may live up to 130 years. Professor Clark of the British Royal Medical College also says that, given the pace of scientific progress, the era of humans living beyond 110 years is approaching. The key issue is to combine longevity with mental health.

Vigege says that no one dies simply from old age; the main cause of death is diseases related to old age. “Our primary goal is to help people live longer and reduce old-age diseases.” Experts from the British Medical Research Institute believe that scientific research has gained a better understanding of some causes of old-age diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease. This common form of senile dementia was once a mystery to doctors. Currently, there are one million elderly people in Britain suffering from this disease, and the number is expected to double by 1995. By 2025, there will be one billion elderly people worldwide suffering from dementia, half of whom were originally Alzheimer’s patients.

Professor Hawkins, who has been studying geriatric medicine for 30 years, says that human life expectancy can increase with scientific development. “We are not afraid of death in our later years, but we are concerned about losing freedom due to the decline of physical and mental functions.” His words reflect the sentiments of most elderly people.

Recently, medical scientists have discovered genetic factors closely related to Alzheimer’s disease. Experts from Britain, Belgium, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain have jointly analyzed blood samples from families with two or more Alzheimer’s patients. Professor Hardy of Britain says, “We already know which chromosome this gene is located in, meaning we no longer need to search the entire haystack for a needle; we just need to focus on one bundle of hay.” It is estimated that this “needle” will be found in the next five to ten years. By then, it may be possible to develop a drug to control the occurrence and development of Alzheimer’s disease.

In addition, significant progress has been made in researching several common diseases that cause death in the elderly, such as heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporosis.

The health problems of the elderly are often overlooked by the state and society. Now, with the increase in the elderly population in many countries, attention should be shifted to this issue. According to a report in The Times, elderly patients over 65 in Britain occupy half of the hospital beds nationwide, and three-quarters of the beds in local nursing homes are filled with elderly people suffering from various diseases. The state spends $7.4 billion annually on medical expenses for elderly patients over 75. A spokesperson for an elderly welfare organization said, “Why does the state spend so much money on the elderly when they fall ill, but is so stingy when it comes to ensuring their health?” He said that it is entirely possible for the elderly to live long and healthy lives, which would not only be a burden on society but also a valuable asset in their later years.

　　人能健康地活百岁
    陈封
    人类的寿命一般能达到多少年？谁也说不清。九十年前欧洲人的平均寿命是四十五岁，现在八十岁以上的男子和九十岁以上的妇女已不算稀奇，这个事实证明科学能够把人类从生到死的旅程延长。
    据荷兰生物学家维吉格说，未来的孩子们可能活到一百三十岁。英国皇家医学院的克拉克教授也说，按照科学进步的速度，人类寿命超过一百一十岁的时代即将到来，所需要解决的问题是长寿加脑力健康。
    维吉格说，没有人单纯因老而死，主要是死于与老年有关的疾病。“我们的首要目的是帮助人们活得长些，并减少老年疾病。”英国医学研究所的专家认为，科学研究已对一些导致老年疾病的原因有了更多的认识，例如“阿尔察默”病。这种属于老年性痴呆症的常见病，数年前医生们对它还是束手无策的。英国患这种病的老人现有一百万，预计一九九五年将增加一倍。到二○二五年全世界将有一亿患痴呆症的老人，其中半数原来就是“阿尔察默”病患者。
    研究老年医学三十年之久的英国霍金森教授说，人类的预期寿命可以随着科学的发展而增加，“我们晚年并不害怕死亡，而是耽心因脑力和体力功能衰竭而失去自由。”他的话反映了大多数老年人的心境。
    最近医学家已发现与“阿尔察默”病有密切关系的遗传因素。英国、比利时、法国、意大利、荷兰和西班牙的专家们已联合起来分析曾出现过两个以上“阿尔察默”病患者的家庭成员的血样。英国的哈代教授说：“我们已经知道这个基因在人类的哪个染色体中，也就是说不必在整个草垛里去寻觅一根针了，只要集中全力于一捆草了。”估计这根“针”还需要五至十年才能找到。到那时，就可能产生一种药物来控制“阿尔察默”病的发生与发展。
    此外，在研究使老年人致死的几种常见病，如心脏病、乳腺癌、骨质疏松病等方面也大有进展。
    老年人的健康问题往往被国家和社会所忽略，现在因许多国家中老年人口的普遍增加，应该把注意力转移过来了。据《泰晤士报》报道，英国六十五岁以上的老年病人占据着全国各医院半数病床，各地疗养所的四分之三也住满了患有这样或那样疾病的老人。国家每年支付七十五岁老年病人的医药费达到七十四亿美元。一位老年福利机构的发言人说，为什么国家“在老年人患病时不惜花钱，而在保障他们健康方面却吝啬呢？”他说，使老年人长寿并且身心健康地活着完全可能，那不但不是社会的负担，他们在晚年的贡献将是社会的宝贵财富。
