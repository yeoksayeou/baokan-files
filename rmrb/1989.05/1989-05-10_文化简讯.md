The China Children's Art Theatre is currently rehearsing the large-scale play "The Sun Sacrifice." The play, set against the backdrop of the clash between China's economic reforms and the old system and old ideas, depicts the current severe difficulties in the education sector. It praises the educators who, despite the hardships, dedicate their youth, love, and even lives to education. The script for "The Sun Sacrifice" is written by Cao Wei Fang and Wu Xiao, and directed by Shang Hong You.

The Taiwan Huaxia Cultural and Art Delegation, consisting of 40 people, arrived in Beijing at the invitation of the China International Cultural Tourism Company. The delegation includes Taiwanese singer Li Ya Ming and 12 outstanding Taiwanese fashion models. They will hold a "Fashion Show and Popular Singing Concert" from May 12th to 15th at the Capital Gymnasium.

The Taiwanese fashion models, who have performed in Europe and America several times, have a strong lineup. This time in Beijing, they will showcase 460 sets of Taiwanese fashion with the assistance of the Beijing Fashion Performance Team. The leader, Miss Zeng Xia, introduced that Eastern fashion is gaining attention from more and more countries. She hopes to form a joint team with mainland fashion models to promote Chinese fashion with its unique Eastern charm to the world.

The song and dance troupe of the Shaanxi Provincial Song and Dance Theatre has performed "Tang Dynasty Chang'an Joyous Dance" since 1983, with a total of 1,009 performances and an audience of 700,000 people from both China and abroad.

The Master Bai Art Research Association was recently established in Beijing. This art group aims to study and develop the painting art of the famous painter Lou Shi Bai.

The People's Literature Publishing House and the China Writers Association Guangxi Branch recently held a discussion in Beijing on the long reportage novel "Report from Hell" by Kang Jin. The work exposes, through a large amount of historical facts, the human tragedy caused by the highly toxic plague bacilli manufactured by the Japanese Kwantung Army's Unit 731, which led to a plague epidemic in Northeast China during the Anti-Japanese War. This is the first long novel since the founding of the nation to describe this bacterial warfare. More than ten writers and critics from the capital participated in the discussion.
