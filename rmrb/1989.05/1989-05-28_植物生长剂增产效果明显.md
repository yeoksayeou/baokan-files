In a recent national agricultural technology promotion conference held by the Ministry of Agriculture, the "Cui Zhu" brand plant growth promoter produced by the Additive Factory of the Logistics Department of the Guangzhou Military Region attracted the attention of attendees. When this growth promoter is diluted with water and sprayed on leaves, it can increase crop yields by 10% to 30%.

This growth promoter is specifically designed for foliar application to grains, fruit trees, cotton, vegetables, and other economic crops in China. It is easily soluble in water, harmless to humans and livestock, and convenient to use.

It is understood that this plant growth promoter has been tested and promoted in ten provinces and autonomous regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, and Yunnan, with significant yield-increasing effects on crops.
