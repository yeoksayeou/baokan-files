The rainy season has passed, and spring tea in Zhejiang is beginning to be harvested, soon entering the peak procurement season. However, procurement funds have only been secured for half of the required amount. Relevant departments have prepared 20 yuan, 30 yuan, and 50 yuan vouchers, and some tea-producing areas have already started issuing IOUs or stopped procurement. Relevant personnel suggest that for agricultural and sideline products, multiple channels for fundraising and procurement should be allowed to alleviate the state's financial difficulties and eliminate the phenomenon of issuing IOUs.

According to a report from the Zhejiang Daily, the spring tea production in Zhejiang Province this year can reach over 1 million dan. The person in charge of tea procurement at the provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative said that the procurement of spring tea requires approximately 300 million yuan in funds, but currently, less than half of this amount has been secured, which is indeed worrying.

The peak season for spring tea procurement is approaching, but the funding gap is so large, and each department has its own practical difficulties. It seems that this year's spring tea procurement will have to issue IOUs.

　　收购旺季已到　资金只够一半    
    浙江春茶收购又打白条
    本报讯  谷雨已过，浙江春茶陆续上市，即将进入收购旺季，但收购资金只落实半数，有关部门早就备好２０元、３０元和５０元的代用券，个别茶区已出现白条或停收现象。有关人士建议，对农副产品应允许多渠道集资、多渠道收购，缓解国家资金困难，根绝白条现象。
    据浙江日报报道，浙江省今年春茶产量可达１００多万担。省供销社主管茶叶收购的负责人说，全省春茶收购约需资金３亿元，目前落实的连一半都不到，确实使人心焦。
    春茶收购旺季眼看就要来到，而资金缺口如此之大，各部门又都有实际困难，看来今年春茶收购只好打白条。
