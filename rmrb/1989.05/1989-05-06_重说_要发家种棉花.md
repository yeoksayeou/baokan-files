Title: Revisiting "To Get Rich, Plant Cotton"

This year, cotton production has seen a decline, and many people are worried. However, in the cotton-producing region of Weishi County in eastern Henan, I saw a heartening scene of people striving to "climb the slope." Despite a significant natural disaster last year, the county's total cotton production still slightly exceeded the bumper harvest of 1987. This year, they aim to set a new historical high-yield record.

Why is the enthusiasm for planting cotton among Weishi farmers unabated? I visited some places and found that in this county, the phrase "To get rich, plant cotton" is extremely popular. They not only say it but also act on it. The entire county, united in purpose, has seen its cotton production increase tenfold in nearly 10 years, and farmers' incomes have also increased nearly tenfold. Farmers joyfully say: they "ride cotton cars, live in cotton houses, wear cotton clothes, and make cotton money." They have indeed become rich by planting cotton, transforming this formerly impoverished area of the Yellow River floodplain into a prosperous countryside.

This is the driving force behind Weishi farmers' relentless pursuit of high cotton yields.

"To get rich, plant cotton" is a catchphrase created by farmers in the cotton-producing areas in the 1950s. Through the efforts of rural cadres and the media, it became a vivid slogan for mobilizing farmers to restore and develop cotton production. Unfortunately, it was soon criticized as "promoting the capitalist road" and was condemned. Newspaper editors made self-criticisms, and rural cadres stopped promoting it. Instead, they advocated for "planting cotton for the revolution." Since then, cotton production has been stagnant.

The numerous folk sayings about agricultural activities in our rural areas are a treasure trove of the people's wisdom. They are the farmers' summaries of their production and life experiences in their own language. Take "To get rich, plant cotton," for example. It not only pointed out a realistic path to wealth in the 1950s but also expressed the farmers' urgent desire to end poverty after becoming landowners. Historical experience tells us that developing agricultural production without combining it with farmers' desire to get rich, and without respecting farmers' legitimate wish to get rich, is bound to be punished by life. In the early years of rural reform, we learned from past lessons, firmly abandoned the "leftist" policies that deprived farmers, and implemented policies that encouraged farmers to get rich through labor, thus achieving a miraculous development in cotton production.

Some people easily suffer from "forgetfulness" when it comes to farmers' issues. When cotton production increases a bit and farmers' lives improve a bit, they no longer pay attention to listening to farmers' voices, are unwilling to engage in equal exchanges with farmers, and even start plotting against farmers, going so far as to commit various acts of cheating and exploiting them. They do not know that today's farmers are not the same as yesterday's. The awakening of commodity consciousness has made them much smarter than before. Farmers have begun to learn to use the law of value to protect their interests. This is the reason why cotton production and procurement have declined in some places.

According to reports, recently some counties and cities, in order to complete the cotton procurement plan and ensure good production this year, have held mass meetings to call on farmers to sell and plant more "patriotic cotton." I think that if we only ask farmers to be patriotic while ignoring their economic interests, such measures will not be very effective. The most appealing slogans are those that unite the interests of the "country" and the "family," such as "To get rich, plant cotton," which can better win the support of farmers. Of course, slogans should not just be empty words; what is more important is to sincerely and genuinely implement them, just like Weishi County, by wholeheartedly serving the farmers, solving their problems, ensuring the supply of production materials, strengthening scientific and technological guidance, and ensuring the procurement and payment for cotton, ultimately allowing cotton farmers to obtain their deserved economic benefits. This year, the state has announced an increase in the cotton procurement price, which is a move that wins the hearts of the people and is in line with the will of the people. We should proudly reiterate to the farmers: "To get rich, plant cotton," and encourage the vast number of cotton-growing farmers to get rich through hard work.

### 重说“要发家种棉花”

　　重说“要发家种棉花”
    季音
    今年棉花生产出现滑坡，许多人为此担忧。但我在盛产棉花的豫东尉氏县却看到了一片奋力“上坡”的喜人景象。去年全国棉花减产，这里战胜了严重自然灾害，总产量仍然略多于丰收的１９８７年。今年他们提出，要再创一个历史高产纪录。
    为何尉氏农民植棉的热情不衰？我去看了一些地方，发现在这个县里，“要发家、种棉花”这句顺口溜极为流行，不但说，而且干，全县上下，同心同德，近１０年里全县棉花产量增长了１０倍，农民收入也增加了近１０倍，农民兴高采烈地说：他们“骑的棉花车，住的棉花楼，穿的棉花衣，发的棉花财”，农民确确实实靠着种棉花发了家，使这个昔日穷困的黄泛区农村初步走上了富裕路。
    这就是尉氏县农民不倦地追求棉花高产的动力。
    “要发家，种棉花”，这是５０年代棉区农民创作的一句顺口溜，经过农村干部与报刊的广为传播，它成了当年动员农民恢复与发展棉花生产的一个生动口号。可惜的是，没有多久，这句深得民心的顺口溜被斥为“鼓吹资本主义道路”而遭到批判，报纸编辑作检讨，农村干部也不再宣传，替代它的是“为革命种棉花”的豪言壮语。从此棉花生产也就一蹶不振。
    我国农村里记述农业活动的大量顺口溜，是一座群众智慧的宝库，它是农民用自己的语言对生产、生活经验的总结。就说这“要发家、种棉花”，既指出了５０年代农村的一条现实的致富之道，也从侧面吐露了解放初期的农民在成了土地的主人以后，迫切要求结束贫困的心愿。历史经验告诉我们，发展农业生产不与农民的发家致富相结合，不尊重农民“要发家”的正当愿望，就难免受到生活的惩罚。农村改革的头几年，我们吸取过去的教训，坚决抛弃了剥夺农民的“左”的政策，推行鼓励农民劳动致富的政策，才实现了棉花生产奇迹般的大发展。
    有些人在对待农民的问题上很容易患“健忘症”，棉花多了点，农民生活好了点，他们便不再注意倾听农民的呼声，不愿再和农民进行平等的交换，甚至又在农民头上打起主意，不惜干出种种欺农、坑农的勾当。他们不知道，今日的农民已非昨日的农民，商品意识的觉醒使他们变得比过去聪明多了，农民已开始学会使用价值规律的武器来保护自己的利益。这就是有些地方棉花生产与收购出现滑坡的根由。
    据报载，最近有些县市为了完成棉花收购计划，搞好今年的生产，召开群众大会，号召农民多卖、多种“爱国棉”，我以为，如果只要求农民爱国而忽视他们的经济利益，这种做法肯定不会收到多大实效。真正有号召力的，莫如“要发家，种棉花”这类把“国”与“家”的利益统一起来的口号，更能得到农民的拥戴。当然，口号不能只挂在口头上，更重要的是要实实在在。不折不扣地去做，就像尉氏县那样，诚心诚意地为农民服务，为他们排忧解难，搞好生产资料供应，加强科学技术指导，抓好棉花的收购与兑现，最终让种棉农民得到应得的经济实惠。今年国家已宣布提高棉花的收购价格，这是得人心、合民意的。我们应当理直气壮地向农民重申：“要发家，种棉花”，鼓励广大棉区农民用勤劳的双手发家致富。
