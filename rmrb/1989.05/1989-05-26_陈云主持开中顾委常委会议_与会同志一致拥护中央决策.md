Chen Yun presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Advisory Commission today and delivered an important speech.

The meeting conveyed and studied the series of important directives issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on opposing turmoil and maintaining social stability.

All attendees unanimously expressed their support for Chen Yun's important speech, and firmly supported Li Peng and Yang Shangkun's speeches at the meeting of Party, government, and military cadres in Beijing. They also firmly supported the correct decisions and resolute measures taken by the Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation.

Everyone agreed that the Chinese revolution has undergone decades of arduous struggle, sacrificing more than 20 million people to establish the People's Republic of China. Victory did not come easily. We are all old comrades who have struggled for decades for the creation and construction of a socialist republic. We deeply understand that if we do not resolutely suppress this turmoil created by a very small number of people, there will be no peace for the Party or the country. Not only will the achievements of the past decade of reform be lost, but also the revolutionary achievements and the fruits of socialist construction, which were won with blood, will be in danger of being lost. Therefore, at this critical juncture, we old comrades must stand up and, together with all Party comrades, resolutely expose the conspiracies and tricks of the very small number of people who created the turmoil, and resolutely fight against them. We must not retreat, and we must not be the least bit ambiguous. At the same time, we must distinguish the very small number of people from the vast majority of students, and resolutely protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast majority of students. This is the responsibility of each old comrade. Everyone believes that our Party and government have the ability and means to stop the turmoil and will definitely handle the problems facing us in accordance with the common wishes of all ethnic groups in the country.

Comrades pointed out that the occurrence of this turmoil is not accidental. One important reason is that for a considerable period of time, Marxist ideological education has been relaxed, and the Party's ideological and political work has been weakened. The facts once again tell us that to maintain social stability and unity, and to ensure the smooth progress of socialist modernization and socialist reform, we must firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles.

Everyone unanimously agreed that the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast majority of students is very precious and must be fully affirmed. Their desire to promote democracy and combat corruption is in line with the wishes of the Party and government, and must be seriously listened to and actively improved. At the same time, everyone hopes that students will cherish their love for the Party and the country, consider the overall situation, and quickly return to school to resume classes, and strive to learn well to shoulder the historical responsibility of building the future of the motherland.

All attendees also expressed their greetings and thanks to all workers, peasants, intellectuals, medical personnel, and cadres who have been steadfast in their production and work positions, contributing to the rectification and deepening of reform, and to the stoppage of turmoil and the maintenance of social order; to the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers who have strictly observed discipline and actively performed their martial law duties; and to the public security and armed police officers and soldiers. They expressed their greetings and respect.

Attendees included Vice Chairmen of the Central Advisory Commission Bo Yibo and Song Renqiong, and Standing Committee members Wang Ping, Wang Shoudao, Wu Xiuquan, Liu Lan Tao, Jiang Hua, Yang Dezhi, Xiao Ke, Yu Quli, Song Shi Lun, Zhang Jiefu, Lu Dingyi, Chen Pixin, Chen Xilian, Hu Qiaomu, Duan Junyi, Geng Biao, Ji Pengfei, Huang Zhen, and Kang Shien. Huang Huoqing also attended the meeting.

Five Standing Committee members were absent due to illness or other reasons.

Comrade Cheng Zihua telephoned the meeting to express his firm support for the correct decisions and measures taken by the Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil.

　　陈云主持开中顾委常委会议
    与会同志一致拥护中央决策
    新华社北京５月２６日电  中央顾问委员会主任陈云今天主持召开了中顾委常委会议，并在会上作了重要讲话。
    会议传达和学习了党中央和国务院关于反对动乱、维护社会安定的一系列重要指示精神。
    与会同志一致表示，坚决拥护陈云同志的重要讲话，坚决拥护李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志在中央和北京市党政军干部大会上的讲话，坚决拥护党中央和国务院为制止动乱、稳定局势作出的正确决策和采取的果断措施。
    大家认为，中国革命经过了几十年的艰苦奋斗，牺牲了两千多万人，才建立了中华人民共和国。胜利来之不易。我们都是为社会主义共和国的创建和建设奋斗了几十年的老同志，深知如果不把极少数极少数人制造的这场动乱坚决平息下去，就会党无宁日，国无宁日。不仅十年改革的成果保持不住，而且用鲜血换来的革命成果和社会主义建设的成果，都有丧失殆尽的危险。所以，在这样的紧急关头，我们老同志一定要挺身而出，和全党同志一道，坚决揭露极少数极少数制造动乱的人的阴谋诡计，坚决同他们进行斗争，决不能退让，决不能有丝毫的含糊。同时，我们要把极少数极少数人同广大青年学生严格区别开来，坚决保护广大青年学生的爱国热情。这是我们每个老同志的责任。大家相信，我们的党和政府有能力有办法制止动乱，并且一定会按照全国各族人民的共同意愿，妥善处理好面临的问题。
    同志们指出，这场动乱的出现，绝不是偶然的。其中一个重要的原因，就是相当一段时期以来，放松了马克思主义的思想教育，削弱了党的思想政治工作。事实再一次告诉我们，要维护社会的安定团结，要保证社会主义现代化建设和社会主义改革事业的顺利进行，必须坚定地坚持四项基本原则。
    大家一致认为，广大同学的爱国热情是非常可贵的，一定要充分肯定。他们希望促进民主、整治腐败的要求与党和政府的愿望是一致的，一定要认真听取，积极改进党和政府的工作。同时大家殷切希望同学们发扬爱党爱国之心，顾全大局，尽快回到学校复课，努力学好本领，以担当历史赋予的建设祖国未来的重任。
    全体与会同志还向一切坚守生产、工作岗位，为治理整顿和深化改革，为制止动乱、维护社会秩序做出贡献的广大工人、农民、知识分子、医务人员、机关干部，表示慰问和感谢；向严守纪律，积极履行戒严任务的人民解放军指战员表示慰问和敬意；向广大公安干警、武警指战员表示慰问和敬意。
