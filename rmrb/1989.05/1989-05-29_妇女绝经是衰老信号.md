Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 29th.

A survey in the United States has found that women who experience natural menopause before the age of 45 may die earlier than their peers.

According to the *American Journal of Public Health*, menopause is a marker of aging and health status in women.

Researchers from the University of Minnesota conducted a survey of 5,287 white women who had experienced menopause in 1976. Six years later, 772 of these women had died from various causes, including 139 who had experienced menopause before the age of 45.

Women typically experience menopause around the age of 50. The survey found that women who experienced natural menopause before the age of 40 had a 95% higher risk of death compared to women who experienced menopause between the ages of 50 and 54. Women who experienced menopause between the ages of 40 and 44 had a 39% higher risk of death.

The survey also found that menopause and death do not seem to be related for women who have undergone surgical menopause.

　　妇女绝经是衰老信号
    新华社华盛顿电  美国一项调查发现，４５岁之前自然绝经的妇女可能比同龄妇女死得早。
    据《美国公共卫生杂志》报道，妇女绝经期是妇女身体老化和健康情况的标志。
    明尼苏达大学的研究人员于１９７６年对５２８７名绝经的白人妇女作了调查。６年后，这些妇女中有７７２人死于各种原因，其中有１３９人是在４５岁之前绝经的。
    妇女通常是在５０岁左右绝经。调查发现，４０岁之前自然绝经的妇女死亡的危险比在５０—５４岁绝经的妇女的死亡危险高９５％，而４０—４４岁绝经的妇女的死亡危险则高３９％。
    调查还发现，绝经与死亡，对因手术而绝经的妇女似乎没有什么关系。
