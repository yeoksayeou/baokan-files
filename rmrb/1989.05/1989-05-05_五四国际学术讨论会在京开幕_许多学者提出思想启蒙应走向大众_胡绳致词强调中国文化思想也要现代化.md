More than 130 scholars from China and abroad gathered in the auditorium of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences today to participate in the academic symposium on "The May Fourth Movement and China's Cultural Construction." The symposium was organized by the academy.

Hu Sheng delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, highly praising the pioneers of the May Fourth Movement for their contributions to China's modernization. He also pointed out that practical experience has shown that "cultural development is inseparable from economic and political development. Since China's economy and politics need to achieve modernization, cultural thought must also adapt accordingly. Therefore, any proposal to deny the achievements of the May Fourth New Culture Movement and to restore the dominance of feudal old morality and old ethics is impractical, undesirable, and harmful." Hu Sheng also expressed his disagreement with the views of "complete Westernization" and cultural nihilism.

Although there is considerable debate over the relative importance of enlightenment and national salvation in the May Fourth Movement, many scholars have shown particular interest in re-evaluating the issue of enlightenment. American scholar Lin Yusheng said in his speech, "Enlightenment of thought is one of the greatest symbols of the May Fourth Movement." He believed that the biggest historical dilemma facing China since the May Fourth Movement is that people's urgent desire to find a way out in times of crisis has led them to easily accept the guidance of a strong ideology, making "all thought and action its tool," which has brought about major disasters and crises. Therefore, people seek another strong ideology. To break out of this vicious cycle, it is necessary to rebuild a "multi-faceted and open rational enlightenment spirit" and "build a truly open modern political, economic, and educational system."

Li Zehou reiterated his view that the May Fourth Movement was "national salvation over enlightenment," arguing that this made the May Fourth Movement "emotional but lacking in reason, achieving results on a larger scale and in a broader scope, but also sowing the seeds of disaster." He attributed the emergence of today's irrationalism and new authoritarianism to this bias. Li Zehou's views sparked a debate among scholars.

Many scholars proposed that enlightenment should move from the intellectual community to the masses, and that the intellectual community should pay attention to operational consciousness and operational practice in cultural reconstruction, believing that this is also the practical significance of the May Fourth Movement.

The symposium received 90 papers. Scholars from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, as well as the Soviet Union, the United States, Sweden, and Japan were also invited to participate in the symposium. The symposium will conclude on May 7.

　　五四国际学术讨论会在京开幕     
    许多学者提出思想启蒙应走向大众    
    胡绳致词强调中国文化思想也要现代化
    本报北京５月５日讯  今天，１３０余位中外学者带着对跨度为７０年的两个“五四”的思索与观感，走进中国社会科学院学术报告厅，参加该院主持的主题为“五四运动与中国文化建设”学术讨论会。
    胡绳在开幕式上致辞，他高度评价了五四运动的先驱者们在中国现代化事业的开创之功。他还认为，实际生活已经证明，“文化的发展，是和经济、政治的发展不可分的。既然中国的经济、政治要实现现代化，那么文化思想也必须与之相适应。因此，否定五四新文化运动的一切成果，倒退回去，复辟封建旧道德、旧礼教的统治地位的任何主张都是行不通的，不可取的，有害的。”胡绳同时也对“全盘西化”和民族虚无主义的观点表示了异议。
    尽管对于五四运动中启蒙与救亡的历史意义孰轻孰重有很大争议，但许多学者都对重新认识思想启蒙这一问题表现了特别的关注。美国学者林毓生在发言中说：“思想的启蒙是‘五四’的最大象征之一”，他认为五四以来中国最大的历史难题在于，人们在危机中寻求出路的急切心情使他们轻易地接受强势意识形态的指引，以致“一切思想与行动都变成了它的工具”，带来重大灾难和危机，于是人们又去寻找另一强势意识形态。想走出这种恶性循环，唯有重建“多元而开放的理性启蒙精神”，“建设真正开放性的现代化政治、经济与教育制度”。
    李泽厚则重申他的五四运动“救亡压倒启蒙”的观点，他引申道，这使得“五四”“激情有余理性不足，在更大规模更大范围内取得了成果，也种下了祸根”，他将今天的非理性主义和新权威主义的出现归结为这一偏颇的余脉。李泽厚的观点引起学者们的争鸣。
    许多学者都提出启蒙应从知识界走向大众，在文化重建中知识界应重视操作意识和操作实践，认为这也是五四运动的现实意义所在。
    这次会议共收到９０篇论文。应邀参加会议的还有来自台湾、港澳以及苏联、美国、瑞典、日本的学者。会议将于５月７日结束。
