The vegetable vendors at Beijing's Xidan Market are now learning the art of speaking like students. This is linked to their bonuses.

The market has set eight language standards for the vendors:

1. When a customer approaches the counter, greet them proactively with appropriate terms such as "comrade," "master," "grandpa," "grandma," "little friend," "What would you like to buy?" or "What would you like to see?"

2. When customers are looking at the goods, be ready to answer questions, provide assistance, and be enthusiastic and patient, even if asked many questions.

3. If the customer wants something that is not available, explain patiently: "I'm sorry, the item you need is temporarily out of stock. Please come back in a few days."

4. Do not say offensive, argumentative, or uncivilized words at the counter.

5. When serving customers, do not be petty about six things.

6. When collecting or giving change, clearly state the amount and say, "This is how much, please check it."

7. If the weight exceeds the amount, say, "Is a little extra okay?"

8. Bid farewell politely, using phrases like "Goodbye" or "Have a safe journey."

These eight items are converted into points in the market's quality service grading standards and are linked to the staff's monthly bonuses. The market also stipulates that if the process lacks the word "You," 15 points will be deducted, and if it lacks the word "Please," 5 points will be deducted. Why is it so strict? The general manager of the market, Liu Yanming, said, "Beijing dialect is originally very pleasant and gentle, but now people have a lot of temper, and even ordinary words are made dirty. The vegetable market is a 'window' industry, and only strict requirements can play a leading role in reversing social trends."

　　菜市场的文明语言教程
    新华社记者  吴锦才
    北京西单菜市场的售货员们现在像小学生一样学习说话的艺术。这与他们的奖金联系起来。
    这个菜市场为售货员们规定了８条语言规范：
    一、当顾客走近柜台时，主动问话，根据不同年龄称“同志”、“师傅”、“老大爷”、“老大娘”、“小朋友”、“您买点什么”或　“看点什么”等迎客语言。
    二、顾客看商品时要有问有答，有要有递，主动热情，百问不烦。
    三、当顾客想买的商品没有时，要耐心解释说：“对不起，您需要的商品暂时没货，过几天您再来看看”。
    四、在柜台内不准说噎人的话、斗气的话、不文明的话。
    五、在接待顾客时要做到６个不计较。
    六、收找货款时要唱收唱付，要说：“您这是多少钱，请您点好”等。
    七、超过分量时应说：“多点行吗？”
    八、礼貌道别，恰当使用“再见”、“您走好”等语言。
    这８个项目在这家菜市场的优质服务等级管理评分标准中分别折算成分数，与职工的月末奖金挂起钩来。这个菜市场还规定，语言全过程无“您”字扣１５分，无“请”字扣５分。为什么要这么严格？菜市场总经理刘燕铭说，北京话本来是很顺耳、很温和的调子，可现在人们火气都挺大，把平常的话都搞脏了。菜市场是“窗口”行业，只有严格要求才能在扭转社会风气当中起带头作用。
