Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th.

The severe slump in the textile industry at the beginning of the year has been reversed in April. The total industrial output value of the national textile industry from January to April accumulated to 420 million yuan, an increase of 3.03% compared to the same period last year.

By the end of April, five types of products, including chemical fibers, yarn, dyed cloth, wool yarn, and textile machinery, have completed their planned progress. However, eight categories of products are still below the level of the same period last year.

The shortage of textile raw materials remains the main problem affecting textile production this year. Most regions have significant shortages, and inventory has decreased. The textile industry department has strengthened the organization and coordination of production, and various regions have taken emergency measures to support textile production from the aspects of energy and funds.
