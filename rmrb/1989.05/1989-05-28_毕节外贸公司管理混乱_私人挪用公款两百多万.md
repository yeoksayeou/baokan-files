The Bijie Foreign Trade Company in Guizhou Province saw 20 employees, under the guise of contracting, arbitrarily embezzle bank loans totaling 269 million yuan for personal business ventures by the end of last year. Although over 20 million yuan has recently been recovered by relevant departments, more than 248 million yuan remains unrecoverable.

It is understood that during the period when the company's party branch secretary, Jiao Zongxin, temporarily managed the company's operations last March, he unilaterally drafted a "contract agreement." Without consulting the company manager, who had legal person status, or submitting it to the supervising department for review, he used the company's name to borrow money from the county agricultural bank, all of which was withdrawn in cash. He personally took 220,000 yuan, and also had a relative take 130,000 yuan for his own use. Seeing the leadership's actions, the other 19 business operation employees of the company also followed suit, taking tens of thousands of yuan each from the loans.

This major case of embezzlement has recently been filed by the Bijie County Procuratorate and is currently under investigation.

　　毕节外贸公司管理混乱
    私人挪用公款两百多万
    据新华社贵阳５月２７日电  （记者张炳森）贵州省毕节县外贸公司２０名职工以承包为名，肆意挪用银行贷款，用于个人经商，到去年底，挪用贷款达２６９万多元。最近虽被有关部门追回２０余万元，尚有２４８万多元难以收回。
    据了解，这家公司的党支部书记焦宗信在去年３月暂时代管公司经营业务期间，擅自拟订了一份“承包合同”。他在拟订这份合同后，既不向具有企业法人资格的公司经理征求意见，也未送主管部门审查，便以企业名义向县农业银行贷款，并全部以现金方式提取出来。他自己领走２２万多元，同时又让他的一个亲戚领走１３万多元，也归他使用。该公司其他１９名经营业务人员见到领导如此干法，也竞相几万、几十万地领用贷款。
    这起重大的挪用公款案，最近已由毕节县检察院立案，正在查处。
