An 80-year-old man donates money and a house to support education

People's Daily, Guiyang — Reporter Pan Di Du reports: Guizhou Provincial Political Consultative Conference member, 84-year-old Mr. Wan Shiqiong, recently donated money and a house to support education.

On April 13th, Mr. Wan and other members of the Political Consultative Conference visited Mengguan Township on the outskirts of Guiyang. He saw that the school buildings of Wuxing Primary School were a dilapidated temple, and the students' desks and chairs were incomplete, which made him very sad. The next day, he donated 2,000 yuan to Wuxing Primary School. A few days later, he wrote a letter to his cousin and nephew in Tongren, asking them to donate one of his houses to the Tongren Municipal Education Bureau, and sent 100 yuan as handling fees.

    今年４月１３日，万式炯老人和其他政协委员一起到贵阳郊区孟关乡参观考察。他见到这个乡的五星小学校舍是一座破庙，学生的桌椅也不全，心里十分难过。次日，他把２０００元捐赠给五星小学。几天后，他又给在铜仁的堂弟和族侄写信，委托他们将自己的一幢房屋捐献给铜仁市教育局，并寄去１００元作为代办费用。
