The Austrian government has expressed enthusiastic welcome for Hungary's beginning of the demolition of military obstacles along the Hungarian-Austrian border, calling it a "major step towards further improving bilateral relations."

According to the Austrian Press Agency, the Hungarian border guards began dismantling barbed wire and electronic alarm systems and other military facilities at several major sections of the Hungarian-Austrian border today. The demolition work will proceed at a rate of 4.5 to 5 kilometers per week, and by the end of 1990, all obstacles along the approximately 350-kilometer-long common border will be removed.

Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said that the demolition of border obstacles not only strengthens mutual trust between the two countries but also, from a European perspective, is a "historically rare event, because it means the first opening of the border line between East and West Europe."

May 2, Hungarian border guards near Hegyeshalom began dismantling the electric fence separating them from the West. According to reports, the alarm devices along this border line are scheduled to be completely dismantled by the end of 1990. Hungary is the first Eastern European country to dismantle border defense facilities.

　　奥地利总理说    
    匈的举动是历史性罕事
    新华社维也纳５月２日电  奥地利政府对匈牙利今天开始拆除匈奥边界军事障碍设施表示热烈欢迎，认为这是“进一步改善两国关系的重大步骤”。
    据奥新社报道，匈牙利边防军今天在匈奥边界的几个主要地段上开始拆除铁丝网和电子警报系统等军事设施。拆除工作将以每周４．５公里至５公里的速度进行，到１９９０年底，将全部拆除总长约３５０公里的共同边界线上的障碍物。
    奥地利总理弗兰茨·弗拉尼茨基说，拆除边界障碍不仅仅加强两国之间的相互信任，而且从全欧的角度看，也是“历史性的罕事，因为这意味着首次打开东西欧之间的边界线”。

   5月2日，匈牙利海杰什豪洛姆附近的边防战士开始拆除与西方隔离的电网。据报道，这条边防线上的报警装置拟于1990年底全部拆完。匈牙利是第一个拆除边防设施的东欧国家。
