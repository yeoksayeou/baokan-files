Last July 10, our cooperative purchased 600 kilograms of long-lasting phosphorus pesticide for 22,200 yuan from the Qingzhou City Agricultural and Sideline Products Company. Unfortunately, after selling this batch of pesticides, cotton farmers reported that the pesticides were ineffective and demanded a refund. On July 18, relevant personnel from our cooperative, along with officials from the county plant protection station and the county industrial and commercial administration, went to the Shandong Province Pesticide Research Institute Quality Testing Center to test and identify this batch of long-lasting phosphorus. The results showed that the long-lasting phosphorus content was zero. On July 21, our cooperative sent someone to Qingzhou City to negotiate a refund, but the leaders of the Qingzhou City Agricultural and Sideline Products Company kept finding excuses and refused to resolve the issue.

To address the issue of this batch of fake pesticides, we have gone to Qingzhou City multiple times to negotiate, but the problem has not been resolved to this day. More than 5,000 mu of cotton fields in our county have been damaged, and our cooperative has also suffered significant economic losses.

　　我们受假农药之苦谁来管
    去年７月１０日，我社花２２２００元在青州市土产杂品公司购买了６００公斤久效磷农药。可没想到，这批农药售出后，棉农纷纷反映这批农药无效，要求退货。７月１８日，我社有关人员与县植保站、县工商所的同志到山东省农药研究所质量检测中心，对这批久效磷进行了化验和鉴定，结果是久效磷含量为零。７月２１日，我社派人到青州市协商退货退款，但青州市土产杂品公司领导人却一味寻找借口，不肯解决问题。
    为了这批假农药的事，我们多次去青州市交涉，但至今问题没有得到解决。我县棉农的５０００多亩棉田受到损害，也使我社蒙受了巨额经济损失。
