The Soviet People's Congress aims for transparency. The second channel of the central television station broadcasts the entire proceedings of the congress live, and large screens near Red Square have become information centers for passersby to follow the congress's progress. Newspapers also set up phone lines to hear the opinions of voters.

On the first day of the meeting, the *Labor Newspaper* alone received hundreds of phone calls. Voters expressed satisfaction with the democratic atmosphere of the meeting. At the same time, some people thought that the congress should discuss the most important issues and not get bogged down in trivial matters. Others believed that procedures and working rules are not minor issues. Some people felt that Gorbachev was using his authority to "pressure" speakers, while others urged Gorbachev to stay calm and have confidence.

Voters were very dissatisfied with the most primitive method of voting used at the congress, considering it a disgrace.

    会内会外  信息相通
    苏联人代会力求公开性，中央电视台第２套节目全部转播大会实况，红场附近大街上的大屏幕成了行人了解大会进程的信息中心。各报还设电话，听取选民意见。
    开会第一天，仅《劳动报》就接到数百个电话。选民对会上的民主气氛表示满意。同时，有人认为，大会应讨论最重要的问题，不要纠缠枝节；也有人认为，程序和工作细则不是次要问题；有人认为戈尔巴乔夫利用自己的威信对发言人“施压”，也有人要戈尔巴乔夫沉住气，要有信心。
    选民对大会以最原始的方式计票十分不满，认为这是耻辱。
