After Song Taizu Zhao Kuangyin established his dynasty, he implemented a series of measures to strengthen central authority and restore and develop the economy. One of these measures was to prohibit officials from engaging in commercial activities. Those who violated this order were severely punished.

As a statesman, Song Taizu was well aware that officials engaging in commerce would inevitably divert their attention, making it difficult for them to govern diligently. They would be unable to properly address the people's hardships and sufferings. Moreover, officials, relying on their privileges, often bullied the market, monopolized trade, and competed with the people for profits. Furthermore, if officials were eager to pursue wealth, it would easily foster a culture of corruption, leading to political decay. To eliminate this hidden danger, Song Taizu issued an order to officials in various regions, prohibiting them from engaging in commerce and trade. "Those who violate this will be punished according to the law."

However, many officials, driven by greed, continued to act as they pleased, with many daring to test the law. Song Taizu, upon discovering such cases, would immediately punish them. It is recorded that the governor of Liangzhou, Zhou Renjun, was demoted to the position of county magistrate in Pingliang for selling goods illegally. The governor of Lizi, Bai Quanshao, was stripped of his official title and reduced to a commoner for partnering with others to do business in the region. The deputy minister of the Ministry of War, Cao Fei, was sentenced to death and executed in public for sending people to transport goods from Qinzhou to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. At that time, not only were ordinary officials punished for violating the ban, but even the prime minister Zhao Pu, who "operated a shop" for profit, was not spared by Song Taizu despite his role in plotting the Chen Bridge rebellion, which helped Song Taizu seize the throne. Song Taizu still pursued the matter; learning that Zhao Pu was also sheltering officials who accepted bribes, Song Taizu became even more furious and ordered Zhao Pu to be handed over to the Court of the Censorate for punishment, resulting in his dismissal from the position of prime minister.

Song Taizu's crackdown on official commerce, though unable to be completely eradicated due to the inherent problems of the feudal system, did to some extent curb officials from engaging in commerce. Moreover, the regulation he established was followed by his successors. It is recorded that by the time of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty, "officials who had some integrity generally considered making a profit shameful."

### 宋太祖禁止官吏经商

　　宋太祖禁止官吏经商
    宋太祖赵匡胤立国以后，采取了一系列加强中央集权和恢复发展经济的措施，其中有一条，就是禁止官吏经营商业，对违反禁令者，则严加追究。
    作为政治家的宋太祖深知，官吏经商，势必分散精力，难以勤政，于民疾民苦而不能善视善理，再者官吏恃凭特权，往往欺行霸市、垄断贸易、与民争利；尤其是官吏若热衷于追金逐利，极易助长贪风，导致政治腐败，为消除这种隐患，宋太祖特诏令各地官吏，不许经商贸易，“违者论如律。”
    然而，不少官吏利欲熏心，依然我行我素，以身试法不乏其人。对此，宋太祖一经发现，即予惩处。据载，凉州知州周仁俊倒卖物资，被改授为平凉县令，受到降职处分；澧州刺史白全绍与人合资在当地经商，被削职为民；兵部郎中曹匪躬遣人自秦州往江浙一带贩运货物，被处以死刑“弃市”。当时，不仅一般官吏违禁要受到处罚，就连宰相赵普“营邸店”牟利，宋太祖也并不因他曾策划陈桥兵变，帮助自己夺取了皇位而轻易放过，仍加以追究；又闻知赵普尚有庇护受贿官员等行为，宋太祖更加恼火，下令将赵普交御史府问罪，被罢免了宰相职位。
    宋太祖查处官商，虽由于封建制度自身的滋生而不能根除，但毕竟在一定程度上遏制了官吏经商，而且他立下的这一法规，为他的后继者所遵循，史称至宋仁宗时，“仕宦之人粗有节义者，皆以营利为耻。”
