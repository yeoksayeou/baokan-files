On May 6, the Xiantan City Administration for Industry and Commerce presented a banner reading "Noble Character in the Face of a Large Sum of Money" to individual entrepreneur Zhang Shaoqi of Xiantan County.

On March 26, Zhang Shaoqi went to Shaoxing City in Zhejiang Province to purchase fabric. While paying, he suddenly discovered that his wallet contained an extra 40,000 yuan. He then recalled the scene two days earlier when he withdrew money from the post office in Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. That day, Zhang Shaoqi used a non-local savings book to withdraw 33,000 yuan for purchasing goods at the Suzhou City post office. The clerk, after handing over the money, Zhang Shaoqi, trusting the post office, did not count the money on the spot, and casually stuffed the money into his shoulder bag. The clerk mistakenly gave Zhang Shaoqi a bundle of 1,000 50-yuan notes instead of 10,000 yuan.

Upon discovering the error, Zhang Shaoqi immediately made a long-distance call to the Suzhou City post office.

　　个体户张少奇得巨款还邮局
    新华社长沙５月１４日电（通讯员赵建梅、祖德润）５月６日，湘潭市工商行政管理局把江苏省苏州市邮局寄来的“巨款面前风格高”的锦旗，送到了湘潭县个体户张少奇家里。
    今年３月２６日，张少奇到浙江省绍兴市购买布匹。在付款中，他突然发现自己的钱袋中多出了４万元。此时，他想起两天前在江苏省苏州邮局取款时的情景。那天，张少奇持异地储蓄证到苏州市邮局提取３．３万元购货款，营业员付款后，张少奇出于对邮局的信赖，当场没有清点，随手将这笔钱塞进挎包，其中营业员误将一扎１０００张面值５０元的人民币当作１万元给了张少奇。
    张少奇发现差错后，立即给苏州市邮局挂了长途电话。
