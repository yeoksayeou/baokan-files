Recently, the Xuzhou Municipal Procuratorate cracked down on two major cases of embezzlement and bribery involving "coal brokers." The manager of the Xuzhou Friendship Department Store, Zhou Zhaoxiang, and the salesperson, Yang Chengxiang, embezzled and accepted bribes totaling over 100,000 yuan while purchasing coal for the Huaiyin City Fuel Company. The manager of the Xuzhou Municipal Materials Bureau Building Materials Trading Center, Zhang Jike, embezzled and accepted bribes totaling over 150,000 yuan during coal trading activities. The three suspects have been arrested by law.

According to local news media, in May last year, the Xuzhou Friendship Department Store signed a contract with the Huaiyin City Fuel Company to purchase coal on their behalf, with Huaiyin paying a commission based on coal prices and quality. Starting from June last year until January this year, Zhou Zhaoxiang and Yang Chengxiang, through relationships with over 10 people from the Jiangsu Provincial Foundry and Heat Treatment Research Institute and the Xuzhou Mining Bureau Mechanical Department, purchased a total of 180,000 tons of coal. They extorted over 100,000 yuan in cash outside of the official receipts. To ensure that Huaiyin could account for the transactions, they issued nearly 10 fake invoices in places like the Xuzhou Longyun Tax Sub-bureau Yong'an Tax Office under the guise of transfer fees, information fees, etc. Zhou and Yang shared 41,000 yuan in cash (which has been recovered).

From June last year to March this year, Zhang Jike, through relationships, purchased 180,000 tons of coal and sold it to areas in southern Jiangsu and Zhejiang. During this period, Zhang Jike issued fake transportation invoices totaling over 270,000 yuan through places like the Xuzhou Lake Light Department Store. Of this amount, over 140,000 yuan had already been embezzled into his account, while the rest had not yet been deposited. After Zhang's arrest, over 80,000 yuan in illicit funds have been recovered.

The Xuzhou Municipal Procuratorate confirmed that these two cases involve over 30 people, more than half of whom are Communist Party members and cadres.
