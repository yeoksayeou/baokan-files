Some provincial and autonomous region party committees and governments have expressed their support for the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 24th - Some provinces and autonomous regions have sent telegrams to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressing their firm support for the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They also firmly support the Party Central Committee and the State Council's decision to restore order in the capital.

Hubei Province - On May 20th, Comrade Guan Guangfu presided over a meeting of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, where they carefully studied the speeches by Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference, as well as Yang Shangkun's speech. They unanimously agreed that in the face of a few people attempting to create large-scale turmoil, the Central Committee's decisive measures to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation are extremely wise. They unanimously expressed their heartfelt support and resolved to firmly implement these measures.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that the developments over the past month in Hubei and nationwide indicate that the current problems are indeed attempts by a few people to create nationwide turmoil. The situation is severe, and the harm is great. In Hubei, especially in Wuhan, the situation has worsened since May, even disrupting the national railway line, the Jingguang Line, causing serious interference with teaching, transportation, work, production, and people's lives. This has disrupted the rectification and deepening of reforms and caused serious confusion. This situation cannot be allowed to continue.

The Provincial Party Committee believes that it is crucial to clearly and decisively stop the turmoil. This is a serious political struggle facing the entire Party and the people of the nation. The core of this struggle is whether to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles while continuing economic construction and reform and opening up. In this serious political struggle that affects the fate and future of our country, we must resolutely maintain political unity with the Party Central Committee, clearly oppose and stop the turmoil, uphold the Party's basic line, uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, and uphold reform and opening up to ensure the smooth progress of socialist modernization.

In the past period, our province has implemented the Central Committee's instructions to clearly oppose turmoil, stabilize the situation, and focus on guiding work. After listening to the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun in the early hours of May 20th, the Provincial Party Committee immediately made further arrangements based on the spirit and requirements of the Central Committee's decision. The Central Committee's decision is a powerful weapon for us to stabilize the situation in Hubei. We must remain clear-headed, firm in our stance, grasp the policies, pay attention to methods, and through arduous and effective work, firmly, correctly, and effectively implement the Central Committee's decision.

All levels of party organizations and party members in the province are determined to work together, unite as one, and firmly implement the Central Committee's decision. We will strive to do a good job in Hubei and contribute to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation.

Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region - In the early hours of May 20th, we listened to Li Peng's important speech. In the morning, we convened a meeting of the Autonomous Region Party Committee Standing Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Government leadership to study and discuss the speech. The attendees unanimously supported the Party Central Committee and the State Council's major measures to restore normal order in the capital and stabilize the situation, maintaining unity with the Party Central Committee. They also studied specific opinions on implementing these measures in our region. In the afternoon, the Regional Party Committee held a meeting with leaders of various democratic parties, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan patriots to study and discuss how to implement these measures in our region. Everyone agreed that Li Peng's speech is very important and must be carefully implemented. Over the next two days, the Regional Party Committee Standing Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Government leadership continued to study measures to maintain stability and unity in our region and to further improve various aspects of work. The Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the People's Congress, the Discipline Inspection Commission, the People's Political Consultative Conference, the Guangxi Military Region, and the leaders of various democratic parties all conducted study and discussion sessions. All levels and departments in the region organized the masses to study the speech.

The political and economic situation in our region is generally good. To maintain and develop a stable and united political situation and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up, economic construction, and various aspects of work, the Autonomous Region Party Committee and the Autonomous Region People's Government have made the following arrangements:

1. All levels, departments, and units in the Autonomous Region should organize cadres and the masses to continue studying and deeply understanding the spirit of Li Peng's speech, closely linking it with actual work, and implementing it in all aspects.

2. Take effective measures to stabilize social order. Currently, all levels of leadership in our region can strengthen leadership and observe discipline; cadres can firmly hold their posts and work normally; employees in all enterprises and institutions are continuing normal production and work; students in all colleges and universities in the region have mostly returned to normal classes; efforts to strengthen social security and concentrate on combating serious criminal activities are underway; efforts to promote clean government, investigate and punish corruption, and combat corruption are also being intensified.

3. Focus on the rectification and deepening of reforms and economic construction. In particular, focus on disaster relief and agricultural and industrial production. Currently, the disaster situation is easing, and grain prices are stable. The order of agricultural and industrial production is normal.

4. Strengthen ideological and political work. Cherish the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students, strengthen their education, and strive to solve their problems in a rational and orderly manner.

We are determined to do a good job and firmly maintain the stable and united situation in Guangxi.

Zhejiang Province - On May 20th, the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and Central Committee members, alternate members, and members of the Central Advisory Commission who were in Hangzhou held a meeting to study the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Capital Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference, linking it with the actual situation in our province, and discussed several opinions on stabilizing the situation. That evening, the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of provincial and Hangzhou municipal department heads to make arrangements.

(1) The Party Central Committee and the State Council's policy and measures to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation based on the developments in Beijing are correct, and we firmly support them. All levels of party organizations and units must carefully study and fully and correctly understand the decisions made by the Central Committee. It must be seen that the current situation in the capital is very serious and has already affected many cities across the country. Our reform, opening up, and modernization construction, and the future and fate of our country are facing serious threats. The Central Committee's policy and decision are made from the perspective of stabilizing the overall situation. The Central Committee distinguishes between the broad masses of young students and the few people who instigate the turmoil, clearly opposes the turmoil out of concern for the young students. The Central Committee reiterates that it will continue to protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students and will not pursue their excessive remarks and actions during the student movement, and will not harm good people. Bringing in a portion of the military from outside the capital is entirely to assist the armed police and public security officers in maintaining social order in the capital and restoring normal order, and is a necessary measure that is not directed at the students. This point should be explained to the broad masses of young students and the people to dispel various doubts and misunderstandings.

(2) The most urgent and important task at present is to stabilize the overall situation, with a focus on doing a good job with college students. Without a stable overall situation, nothing can be done well. In the past period, the Provincial Party Committee's policy of positive guidance, resolving contradictions, avoiding conflicts, and maintaining order to stabilize the situation is correct. Provincial and municipal leaders have gone to the students for dialogue, heart-to-heart talks, and visits to hospitalized students; school party and government leaders, teachers, and cadres have done a lot of patient guidance and education for the students; public security officers have maintained order day and night, protecting the safety of the students; and medical staff have provided timely and careful treatment and rescue for sick students. All of these have been understood and welcomed by the students and society. We do this because the broad masses of young students are our children and the future of the motherland. Their patriotic enthusiasm is precious. Their aspirations to promote democracy, punish corruption, and prosper the motherland are consistent with our Party and government's goals. Therefore, we will continue to adhere to the policy of guidance for the broad masses of students, protecting their patriotic enthusiasm while helping them see the complexity of the situation, understanding that realizing good wishes requires a process and a stable social environment. We hope that the broad masses of students will consider the overall situation, remain calm, not believe in rumors, and all those who have suspended classes should unconditionally return to school to resume classes. We require all levels of leadership, all democratic parties and mass organizations, teachers, cadres, and parents to show great enthusiasm, care for and love the students, and do a good job of ideological work with patience and care. In the past period, some students have sat in silence and gone on hunger strikes, some have fallen ill, and some have become weak. We will continue to do a good job of treatment. After these students return to school, the school should care for and love them in terms of ideology and life, making them feel warm.

(3) Stabilize the organs, enterprises, and stabilize the workforce, maintaining normal production, work, and social life order. All organs, factories, shops, transportation, and public service departments must observe discipline, hold their posts, and ensure the normal operation of work and production. The leadership of all units must organize cadres and workers to carefully study the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, and must do a good job of ideological education. Communist Party members and Young Communist League members must take the lead in opposing and stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation. It is not allowed for school students to go to factories to connect. To protect the safety of primary and secondary school students, the leadership and teachers of primary and secondary schools must take full responsibility to manage the students, maintain normal teaching order, and not allow students to go out to parade and watch.

(4) Maintain social order. Be highly vigilant against a few bad elements taking advantage of the situation to cause trouble and destruction, especially to prevent looting, arson, robbery, and vandalism. Once discovered, they must be severely punished according to law.

(5) While stabilizing the overall situation, we must continue to focus on rectification and deepening reforms, strengthen clean government construction, and strive to eliminate various corrupt practices, overcome bureaucratism, promote democracy and legal system construction, and win the trust of the people with practical actions. This itself is the foundation for stabilizing the overall situation.

Liaoning Province - The Provincial Party Committee unanimously supports the Central Committee and the State Council's decisive measures to urgently mobilize and firmly stop the turmoil, quickly restoring normal order in the capital. They support the important speech by Li Peng on behalf of the Central Committee and the State Council and the speech by Yang Shangkun, firmly maintaining political unity with the Central Committee, and quickly implementing the spirit of the speeches.

On the morning of May 20th, after the Provincial Party Committee leaders listened to and watched Li Peng's speech on behalf of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the Central Committee at the Capital Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference, they immediately convened a meeting of the secretaries to study and implement the spirit of the speech. In the afternoon of the same day, the Provincial Party Committee issued a notice to all municipal party committees and provincial departments titled "Notice on Carefully Studying Li Peng's Important Speech." At 5 PM on the same day, the Provincial Party Committee convened an emergency meeting of provincial department heads and above to deploy the study and implementation of Li Peng's speech. At the meeting, Comrade Quan Shuren, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, proposed the following requirements:

1. All levels of party organizations must immediately organize all party members, cadres, and the masses to carefully study the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, understand the nature of this struggle and the seriousness of the problem, deeply understand the importance of stopping the turmoil, quickly restoring social normal order, and maintaining stability and unity to defend the Four Cardinal Principles and reform achievements. Require all party organizations in the province to unite the masses, do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, fully play the core leadership and fortress role in stabilizing the situation, and all party members must play a pioneering and exemplary role in stopping the turmoil.

2. Hold your posts and maintain normal production, work, and study order. All students and all sectors of society must immediately stop all parades, strikes, hunger strikes, and support activities, and immediately unconditionally return to class. Organs, factories, shops, and enterprise units must maintain production and work.

3. Effectively maintain social order and resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal activities.

On the morning of May 21st, the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of the Standing Committee to carefully study and discuss the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, further analyze the situation in our province. After Li Peng's speech, all levels of party organizations and the vast majority of party members, cadres, and workers in the province firmly supported it, unanimously agreeing that the Central Committee's decisive measures to stop the turmoil and quickly restore order are necessary and timely. The Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee, after discussion, decided to make stabilizing the situation the top priority, starting from the current situation in Liaoning, and proposed six measures: 1. Deeply study Li Peng's important speech, further unify the thoughts and actions of the entire Party and the people. 2. Do in-depth and detailed ideological work among students, urging them to quickly return to class, stop all parades, strikes, and support activities, and prohibit students from going to factories to connect. 3. Do a good job of stabilizing enterprises. Organ department cadres must firmly hold their posts and be loyal to their duties. 4. Require all Communist Party members to observe party discipline and play a model and pioneering role in stopping the turmoil. 5. Stabilize the economy, organize people's lives, and do everything possible to improve production and ensure the supply of daily necessities. 6. Maintain social order and resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal activities.

Guizhou Province - In the early hours of May 20th, the Provincial Party Committee and Government leaders watched the live broadcast of the Capital Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. In the morning, the Provincial Party Committee and Government issued an "Important Notice" to all local, prefecture, city, and county party committees and governments, and all provincial departments and people's organizations, requiring them to carefully study the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. In the afternoon, they convened an expanded meeting of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee with the participation of leaders from the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Advisory Commission, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Military Region to carefully study and discuss the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. Later, the Provincial Party Committee and Government convened several meetings to further deploy the stabilization of the situation and the maintenance of stability and unity.

1. Firmly support the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, support the Party Central Committee and the State Council's major decision to quickly stop the turmoil, and maintain political unity with the Party Central Committee.

2. Our province has a weak economic foundation, a thin base, and very backward education and culture, coupled with severe disasters, and cannot afford to be disturbed. Considering the overall situation, stabilizing the situation, and maintaining stability and unity is the starting point for all our work. We must, with a high sense of responsibility to the people, do a good job in all aspects of work, maintain normal teaching, production, work, and living order. We must firmly protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people while firmly maintaining the stability of social order.

3. Effectively do a good job with college students. Require department leaders to go deep into the colleges and universities they manage, do their best to stop students from parading and supporting activities, and maintain normal teaching order. For reasonable demands raised by students, various departments must carefully study and do their best to solve them.

4. All levels, departments, and units must educate the masses to consider the overall situation, hold their posts, not go out to parade, do a good job in agricultural and industrial production, ensure the supply of daily necessities, and do a good job in organ work.

5. The judicial and law enforcement departments must further maintain social and traffic order, protect the broad masses of students and the people in their work, and resolutely crack down on a few looting, arson, robbery, and vandalism elements.

　　一些省和自治区党委政府表示
  　拥护党中央国务院决策
    新华社北京５月２４日电  一些省、自治区党委、政府致电党中央、国务院，表示坚决拥护李鹏、杨尚昆同志在中央和北京市党政军干部大会上的讲话，坚决拥护党中央、国务院关于恢复首都秩序的决策。
    湖北省　５月２０日，关广富同志主持召开省委常委会议，认真学习了李鹏同志代表党中央、国务院在中央和北京市党政军干部大会上的讲话及杨尚昆同志的讲话，一致认为，在极少数人妄图制造大规模动乱的紧急关头，中央果断地作出制止动乱、稳定局势的决策，非常英明；一致表示衷心拥护，并要坚决贯彻执行。
    省委认为，近一个月来，全国和湖北的事态发展表明，当前出现的问题确实是极少数人企图制造一场全国性的动乱，形势相当严峻，危害极大。我们湖北，主要是武汉市，进入５月以来，事态也日益扩大，甚至全国铁路干线京广线也在武汉被一度中断，已经严重地干扰了教学秩序、交通秩序、工作秩序、生产秩序和人民的生活秩序，干扰了治理整顿和深化改革的工作，并且造成了严重的思想混乱。这种情况，再也不能任其发展下去了。
    省委认为，旗帜鲜明地、坚决果断地制止动乱，是当前摆在全党和全国人民面前的一场严重的政治斗争。这场斗争的核心问题是在坚持经济建设这个中心和坚持改革开放的同时，要不要坚持四项基本原则。在这场关系到我们国家命运和前途的严重的政治斗争面前，我们决心坚定不移地在政治上和党中央保持高度一致，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，制止动乱，坚持党的基本路线，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，保卫社会主义现代化建设事业顺利进行。
    我省前一段的工作，贯彻了中央提出的旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，稳定局势，具体工作注意疏导的指示精神。５月２０日凌晨收听了李鹏、杨尚昆同志的讲话以后，省委立即根据中央决策的精神和要求，进一步做了部署。中央的决策是指导我们稳定湖北局势的强大武器。我们必须要头脑清醒，坚定立场，掌握政策，注意方法，经过艰苦而卓有成效的工作，坚决地正确地有效地把中央的决策落到实处。
    全省各级党组织和党员，决心和衷共济，团结一致，坚决贯彻中央的决策，努力把湖北的工作做好，为制止动乱和稳定局势做出贡献。
    广西壮族自治区　５月２０日凌晨，我们收听了李鹏同志的重要讲话，当天上午召开了自治区党委常委、自治区人民政府领导会议，进行了认真的学习讨论。与会同志一致拥护党中央、国务院恢复首都正常秩序稳定局势的重大措施，和党中央保持一致，并研究了在我区贯彻落实的具体意见。当天下午，区党委又召开了自治区各民主党派、工商联负责人以及无党派爱国人士的座谈会，进行学习，共商如何在我区贯彻落实。大家一致表示，李鹏同志的讲话很重要，必须认真贯彻落实。这两天，自治区党委常委和自治区人民政府领导继续研究如何维护我区安定团结以及进一步搞好各项工作的措施。自治区顾委、人大、纪委、政协、广西军区和各民主党派领导都进行了学习讨论。全区各地、各部门也都组织广大干部群众进行了学习。
    我区政治和经济形势总的是好的。为了维护和发展安定团结的政治局面，保证改革开放、经济建设和各项工作的顺利进行，自治区党委、自治区人民政府作出了部署：
    １、全自治区各地、各部门、各单位都要组织干部、群众继续学习、深刻领会李鹏同志讲话精神，密切结合实际，落实到各项工作中去。
    ２、采取有力措施，稳定社会秩序。从当前情况看，我区各级领导班子，都能加强领导，遵守纪律；广大干部，都能坚守岗位，正常工作；各企事业单位的职工都在坚持正常的生产工作；全区各地的大专院校学生，大都已经正常上课；强化社会治安，集中打击严重犯罪活动工作正在进行；廉政建设，查处官倒，惩治腐败的工作也在加紧进行。
    ３、切实抓好治理整顿、深化改革和经济建设的各项工作。特别是扎扎实实地抓好当前的救灾工作和工农业生产。现在，灾情趋向缓和，粮价稳中有降。工农业生产秩序正常。
    ４、要加强思想政治工作。爱护广大青年学生的爱国热情，加强对他们的教育工作，尽量使他们提出的问题用符合理性和秩序的办法来解决。
    我们决心做好工作，坚决维护广西安定团结的局面。
    浙江省　５月２０日，省委常委和在杭州的中央委员、候补委员以及中顾委委员开了一个会，学习了李鹏、杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话，联系我省的实际，进行了讨论，研究了几点稳定局势的意见。当天晚上，省委召开省和杭州市机关领导干部会议作了部署。
    （一）党中央和国务院根据北京事态的发展，采取的制止动乱、稳定局势的方针和措施，是正确的，我们表示坚决拥护。各级党组织和各单位要认真学习、全面地正确地理解中央所作出的决策。必须看到，当前首都形势是相当严峻的，而且已经波及到全国许多城市。我们的改革、开放和四化建设，我们国家的前途和命运，已经面临严重的威胁。中央的方针和决策，是从稳定大局出发的。中央把广大青年学生和挑动动乱的极少数人区分开来，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱是出于对青年学生的爱护。中央重申，仍然要坚持保护广大青年学生的爱国热情，对他们在学潮中的过激言行不予追究，决不伤害好人。从外地调一部分军队进京，完全是为了协助武警、公安干警维护首都社会治安，恢复正常秩序，是不得已的，绝对不是针对学生的。这一点，应当向广大的青年学生和群众宣传解释，使他们消除种种疑虑和误解。
    （二）当前最紧迫最重要的任务是稳定大局，重点是做好大专院校学生的工作。没有大局的稳定，什么事情都办不好。省委前一段为了稳定局势采取的正面疏导、化解矛盾、避免冲突、维护秩序的方针是正确的。省、市领导到同学中去对话、谈心、看望住院同学；学校党政领导和教师、干部，对学生做了大量的耐心的疏导和教育工作；公安干警日以继夜地维护秩序，保护同学的安全；广大的医务工作者对有病的同学进行了及时的精心的治疗和救护。所有这些，都受到同学们和社会各界的理解和欢迎。我们这样做，是因为广大的青年学生是我们的子女，是祖国的未来。他们的爱国热情是可贵的。他们促进民主、惩治腐败、繁荣祖国的愿望，同我们党和政府的目标是一致的。因此，对广大学生，我们要继续坚持疏导的方针，既要保护他们的爱国热情，又要帮助他们看到事情的复杂性，懂得实现良好的愿望需要有一个过程，需要有一个安定的社会环境。我们希望广大同学顾全大局，保持冷静，不轻信谣传，凡是停课的，一律无条件地回到学校复课。我们要求各级领导、各民主党派和群众团体、教师、干部、家长都以极大的热情，关心和爱护同学，耐心细致地做好思想工作。前一段，少数同学静坐绝食，有的生病，有的身体虚弱。我们要继续做好治疗工作。这些同学回校以后，学校要从思想上、生活上关心和爱护他们，使他们感到温暖。
    （三）稳定机关、企业，稳定职工队伍，保持生产、工作和社会生活的正常秩序。一切机关、工厂、商店、交通运输和公用服务部门的全体干部、职工，都要遵守纪律，坚守岗位，不要上街游行声援和围观，不要做一切不利于安定团结的事情，保证工作和生产的正常运行。各单位的党政领导，都要组织干部、职工认真学习李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，都要切实做好思想教育工作。共产党员、共青团员都要带头为反对和制止动乱，稳定局势作出贡献。不允许学校学生到工厂串连。为了保护中小学生的安全，中小学校的领导和教师要以高度负责的精神，管好学生，坚持正常的教学秩序，不准学生上街游行和围观。
    （四）维护社会治安。要高度警惕社会上少数坏人乘机捣乱和破坏，特别要防止打砸抢烧，一经发现，就要依法严惩不贷。
    （五）在稳定大局的同时，我们要继续抓紧搞好治理整顿和深化改革工作，切实加强廉政建设，努力消除各种腐败现象，克服官僚主义，推进民主和法制建设，以实际行动取信于民，这本身就是稳定大局的基础。
    辽宁省　省委一致拥护中央、国务院关于紧急动员起来，坚决制止动乱，迅速恢复首都正常秩序的果断措施，拥护李鹏同志代表中央、国务院的重要讲话和杨尚昆同志的讲话，坚决在政治上同中央保持一致，并迅速贯彻落实讲话精神。
    ５月２０日早，省委领导同志收听、收看了李鹏同志代表中共中央政治局常委会在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话后，立即召开了书记碰头会，研究学习贯彻讲话精神，并于当天上午向各市委、省直各部门发出了《关于认真学习李鹏同志重要讲话的通知》。当天下午５时，省委又召开了省直厅局长以上领导干部的紧急会议，部署学习贯彻李鹏同志讲话。会上，全树仁同志代表省委提出要求：
    一、各级党组织要立即组织全体党员、干部和群众认真学习李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，认清这场斗争的性质和问题的严重性，深刻认识制止动乱、迅速恢复社会正常秩序、维护安定团结，对保卫四项基本原则和改革成果的重要意义。要求全省党组织团结广大群众，做好深入细致的思想政治工作，在稳定局势中充分发挥核心领导作用和战斗堡垒作用，全体党员要在制止动乱中发挥先锋模范作用。
    二、要坚守岗位，保持正常的生产和工作、学习秩序。广大学生和社会各界应立即停止一切游行、罢课、绝食和声援活动，并立即无条件复课。机关、工厂、商店和企事业单位干部、职工要坚持生产，坚持工作。
    三、要切实抓好社会治安，坚决打击各种违法犯罪活动。
    ２１日上午省委召开常委会，认真学习和讨论了李鹏同志、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，进一步分析了我省形势。李鹏同志讲话后，全省各级党组织和绝大多数党员、干部、工人坚决拥护，一致认为中央对制止动乱，迅速恢复秩序采取坚决措施是必要的、及时的。省委常委经过讨论决定把稳定局势作为压倒一切的工作，从辽宁当前的实际情况出发，提出六点措施：一、深入学习李鹏同志的重要讲话，进一步统一全党全民思想行动。二是在学生中做好深入细致的思想工作，促使他们迅速复课，停止一切游行、罢课和声援活动，禁止学生到工厂串联。三是做好稳定企业工作。机关干部要坚守工作岗位，忠于职守。四是要求全体共产党员，遵守党纪，在制止动乱中，发挥模范先锋作用。五是稳定经济，组织好人民生活，千方百计搞好生产，保证生活必需品供应。六是抓好社会治安，坚决打击各种违法犯罪活动。
    贵州省　２０日凌晨，省委、省政府负责同志收看了党中央、国务院召开的首都党政军干部大会实况。上午，省委、省政府向各地、州、市、县党委、政府和省级各部门、人民团体发出了关于认真学习李鹏、杨尚昆同志重要讲话的《重要通知》。下午，又召开了有省委、省顾委、省纪委、省人大、省政府、省政协、省军区负责同志参加的省委常委扩大会议，认真学习讨论李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话。以后，省委、省政府又多次召开会议，对进一步稳定局势、维护安定团结进行了部署。
    一、坚决拥护李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，拥护党中央、国务院关于迅速制止动乱的重大决策，在政治上同党中央保持一致。
    二、我省经济基础差，底子薄，教育文化十分落后，加之灾情严重，经不起折腾。顾全大局、稳定局势、维护安定团结是我省一切工作的出发点。我们要本着对人民高度负责的精神，努力作好各方面的工作，维护正常的教学、生产、工作、生活秩序。既要坚决保护广大青年的爱国热情，也要坚定地维护社会秩序的稳定。
    三、切实做好高等院校学生的工作。要求各部门的领导同志深入所管的大专院校，尽力劝阻学生的游行声援活动，维护正常的教学秩序。对学生提出的合理要求，各部门要认真研究，尽力加以解决。
    四、各级各部门各单位都要教育广大群众，顾全大局，坚守岗位，不上街游行，搞好工农业生产，搞好生活必需品的供应，搞好机关工作。
    五、政法部门要进一步维护好社会治安秩序和交通秩序，在工作中，要特别注意保护广大学生、人民群众，要坚决打击极少数打砸抢烧分子。
