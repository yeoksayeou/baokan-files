A joke has been circulating recently: someone placed a small advertisement in the newspaper saying, "A long-kept secret for getting rich, send two jiao, and I will tell you." Many people said, "Two jiao is nothing, let's give it a try, just for fun." So, there were actually tens of thousands of people who happily "gave it a try." They received a reply. The letter contained just two big characters: "Hard Work." "Hard Work" is indeed the way to get rich, no mistake about that. It became a joke for the following reasons: first, the victims were naive and confused; second, the trickster was cunning but also somewhat honest; third, the use of the two characters "Hard Work" was brilliant: using common sense as a secret, using the unchanging to meet the demands of thousands, and using two characters to summarize the essence of a thousand words.

　　致富“秘诀”
    最近流传一个笑话：某人在报纸上登了一则小小的广告，说：“多年秘传，致富之道，寄来两角，即可奉告。”不少的人说：“两角嘛，小意思，试一次，玩玩。”于是，竟然有几万人高兴地“玩玩”了。他们收到回信了，信上写了两个大字：“勤劳”。“勤劳”，确是致富之道，没说错。它之所以成为笑话：一、受骗者天真而又糊涂；二、骗子的狡黠中有点诚实；三、“勤劳”二字用得绝：以常识充私传之秘，以不变应万人之求，以二字钩千言之要。
