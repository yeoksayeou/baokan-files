Japan is, after China, the country with the earliest history of kite flying and currently one of the most spectacular kite performances in the world.

Japan's kite festival has a long history. Every year in May, relevant government departments select a "auspicious day" based on weather forecasts to hold the kite festival in Hamamatsu, known as the "kite hometown" of Japan. Before the festival, countless "kite enthusiasts" from all over Japan compete to devise strategies, exert their ingenuity, and meticulously craft their masterpieces, fearing that the festival's organizing committee might "disqualify" them from entering the competition.

The organizing committee is very strict in selecting the kites for the competition. Those with poor shapes are eliminated; those with poor paintings are screened out; those with outdated designs are put in another category; those with poor durability are disqualified for the next round... Those that are selected are truly the cream of the crop. It is difficult to be selected, and it is even more difficult to fly the kites. Sometimes, a person has to fly over a thousand kites, with the total weight exceeding several times their own body weight. Some kites require several thousand feet of string, and several or even tens of people need to work together to fly them. In recent years, the Japanese kite festival has popularized large kites, and even more popular are giant kites composed of many kites. Locals affectionately call them "kite dragons."

Japan's "kite dragons" can be considered a world-renowned man-made spectacle. They are composed of over a thousand, or even several thousand, kites arranged in a specific sequence, distance, and pattern to form a "dragon." Looking up at the sky, the scales and claws seem to be moving, and the dragon appears to be alive. The first person to create this was a restaurant manager who was good at both thinking and doing. In 1976, he used a 5,480-foot-long string to fly a dragon made up of 1,050 kites. Each kite was spaced five feet apart, with a total weight of 330 pounds, setting multiple world records at the time. He became famous overnight, and many followed in his footsteps. Two years later, a man named Asanoha used a single long string to fly a super giant dragon composed of 3,672 kites, setting a new record.

The Japanese kite festival is always held in a season of clear skies, blooming flowers, and singing birds. The deep blue sky is filled with countless kites of various shapes and colors. Many kites are paired to form large pictures. They sway from side to side, fly up and down, shimmering and sparkling.

This is the "painted birds" coming to life! Not only do the people on the ground shout this, but even the birds in the sky mistake them for their own kind, attracting and dancing together! Thus, the ground and the sky are of the same color, and people, birds, and kites all fly together!

At this moment, people and nature become one. People cannot distinguish between paper kites and feathered birds, nor can they tell the difference between man-made and natural.

Japan's kite festival is beautiful, joyful, and thriving...

　　蓝天上的“画鸟”   
    ——间谈日本风筝节
    柯谱　柯敏戎
    日本是除中国之外，世界上最早玩赏风筝、目前又是表演得最精彩的国家。
    日本的风筝节由来已久。每年五月，政府有关部门根据天气预报，选择一个“吉日”，在日本“风筝之乡”的滨松举行风筝节。节前，全日本数不胜数的“风筝迷”竞相出谋划策，苦运匠心，精制“佳作”，唯恐风筝节的组委会“不准入赛”。
    组委会对参赛风筝的挑选十分苛刻。形态欠美者，淘汰；绘画欠佳者，筛掉；式样欠新者，入另册；耐用欠好者，下回来……能入选的，真是百里挑一的佼佼者。入选难，放飞更难。有时，一个人要放起上千只风筝，总重量超过人体重几倍。有的要用几千尺绳子，由几个人或十几个人合作才能放起。近年来，日本风筝节流行体积庞大者，更盛行由许多风筝组成的大风筝，当地人美其名曰“风筝龙”。
    日本“风筝龙”堪称世界人造奇观。它是由一千多，乃至几千个风筝，按一定顺序、距离、图案等组合而成“一条龙”的。仰视高空，鳞爪飞动，活龙活现。首创者是一位善于动心动手的餐馆经理。他在一九七六年，曾用五千四百八十英尺的长绳，放飞起由一千零五十个风筝组成的长龙。每个风筝之间相隔五英尺，总重量达三百三十磅，创下了当时多项全能世界纪录。他一举成名，步尘者不绝。两年后，有位名叫浅叶的人，用一根长绳放起由三千六百七十二只风筝组成的超级巨龙，创下新的纪录。
    日本风筝节总是在风和日丽，鸟语花香之季举行。湛蓝的天幕上，腾跃起无数各式各样、五颜六色的风筝，许多风筝又成龙配套，构成巨画。它们左右摇曳，上下翻飞，闪闪发抖，熠熠生辉。
    这是“画鸟”活了！不仅地上的人这么喊，就是天上的飞鸟也误以为是同室同族，竟互相招引，款款齐舞！于是，地上天下一色，人鸟风筝齐飞！
    这时，人与自然融为一体。人们分不清哪是纸鸢，哪是毛鸟儿，也不再分哪是人造，哪是天然。
    日本的风筝节是美好的，欢悦的，蒸蒸日上的……
