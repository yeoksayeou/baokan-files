Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 16th.

A relevant official from the Capital Iron and Steel Company stated today that the claim of 70,000 workers at Capital Iron and Steel Company going on strike is not a fact.

The official said in a telephone interview with a reporter from this news agency, “The workers at Capital Iron and Steel Company have been continuing production. Capital Iron and Steel Company is a state-contracted unit. If production stops, not only will the state suffer losses, but the individual workers will also suffer losses.”

An article by the Associated Press today stated that students on Tiananmen Square announced through loudspeakers that “out of the 220,000 workers at Capital Iron and Steel Company, 70,000 have gone on strike this Monday,” in support of the student movement. The official from Capital Iron and Steel Company stated: This is absolutely not true.

    美联社今天的一篇报道说，学生在天安门广场上通过喇叭称，“首钢的２２万职工中，已有７万人本周一罢工”，支持学生运动。首钢的这位负责人说：根本没有这回事。
