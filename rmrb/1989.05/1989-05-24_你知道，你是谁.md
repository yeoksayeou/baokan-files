You always ask me why I like that song, "Do you know who you are, do you know that time flies..." I can't really explain it. I just know that every time I listen to it, something very soft and gentle seems to flow slowly from my heart.

I don't know why, but whenever we're together, you all insist on me talking about myself. And every time you do, I feel at a loss.

Really, I can't describe who I am.

You must remember that day when you saw me on the street, wearing a pretty dress, carrying a big book bag, and riding my bike leisurely. I greeted you with a smile. You asked me where I was going. I stood there, unable to remember why I had come out in the first place. So, we just stood there and chatted for a long time.

You say I'm always so carefree, but I can give you more than ten examples to prove otherwise. For instance, I might get up early on a Sunday morning, go to the market to buy two live fish, take a two-hour bus ride to your place, and announce that I'm going to make steamed fish. But when I see those poor creatures struggling on the cutting board, my heart softens, and I think, "What if they feel pain?" So, I put down the knife and refuse to be the executioner.

Even so, you all still care for me and love me, and it's amazing that you can love someone like me. Sometimes, you bring a bag of fruit to my door, knocking so hard that your beautiful fingers almost break, but no one answers. Do you know what I'm doing? If I tell you, you'll probably be furious. I'm covering my ears with both hands, holding my breath, and deeply engrossed in a novel I just borrowed.

I know you've been trying so hard to turn me into a "lady." You say I should walk with my chest up, stomach in, head held high, and eyes straight ahead. I wore high heels and walked with you for 20 minutes, and by the end, I was so exhausted that I almost collapsed. So, the next day, I went out in jeans and sneakers, feeling much more comfortable.

You tell me that a girl shouldn't sing loudly while walking; she shouldn't laugh unrestrainedly; she shouldn't wear the same clothes for a week without washing them...

I really don't understand why everyone has different faces and wears different clothes, but we all have to have the same personality.

Still, I'm grateful for your advice. I only have you as a friend. Unlike you, on International Women's Day, I don't get colorful postcards. There's an American named Mencken who said he rarely considers someone he's known for less than ten years a close friend. But we've known each other since we were born, and the words "close friend" still make me uncomfortable. I don't even understand myself, so how can I say someone else knows me?

You tried to tell my fortune, without using cards or a computer. You had me draw pictures of mountains, water, roads, trees, and the sun. My two trees were drawn tall and lush, and you were overjoyed, saying they represent two successful careers. You insist that one day I will become some kind of "expert." You bought me paper and pens; I had no choice but to sit at the desk. I usually write beautiful letters, but I couldn't squeeze out a single word, just pulling my hair, biting my lips, and kicking the table. So, I stopped torturing myself and picked up Shi Mu Rong's "There Is a Song" and went out into the sunlight. Ah, there are such beautiful words in the world, why bother struggling to write them and beg others to read them?

From afar, I see your sighing gaze.

Please don't blame me, friend! I'm not saying I haven't tried, trying to figure out who I am and what I should do. But some things are things you want to figure out but can't.

Please don't use any words to describe me, saying I'm like a cloud or a blade of grass. A cloud is a cloud, and a blade of grass is a blade of grass, and I, I am just me!

### 你知道，你是谁

　　你知道，你是谁
    高小英
    “你知道，你是谁，
    你知道，年华似水……”
    你总是问我为什么喜欢这支歌儿，我却怎么也说不清楚。只知道每次听的时候，就好像有什么很轻很柔地自心中缓缓流出。
    不知道为什么大家在一起的时候，你们总是一遍又一遍让我讲我自己，而每到这个时候我就会手足无措。
    真的，我说不清自己是怎样一个人。
    你一定记得那一天你在街上碰到我，穿件漂亮的连衣裙，手里拎个大书包，晃晃悠悠地骑着车。我满面春风地跟你打招呼。你问我打算去哪儿。我愣在那里，怎么也想不起来当初为什么上街来着，于是我们就干脆站在那儿聊了个痛快。
    你说我总是这么漫不经心地怎么行？可我又能举出十个以上的例子证明我不是。比如我可以在某个星期天心血来潮地起个大早，去市场买两条活鱼，滴滴嗒嗒坐上两个钟头汽车到你家，嚷嚷着要做清蒸鱼。可当我发现那两个生灵在案板上拚命挣扎时，心一下子软下来，说不定他们会疼的吧？于是我丢下菜刀，再也不肯去做刽子手。
    即使这样，你们还是疼我爱我，难得你们会爱像我这样一个人。有的时候你拎了一袋水果敲我家的门，你漂亮的手指快敲破了也没人答应。你知道我在干吗？说出来准会把你气死，我两手捂着耳朵，正屏息静气地看一本刚借来的小说。
    我知道你一直煞费苦心地要把我变成一个“淑女”。你说走路时要挺胸收腹昂头并且目不斜视。我穿上高跟鞋与你在街上走了２０分钟，整个人累得几乎瘫掉，于是第二天又换上牛仔裤与旅游鞋自自在在上了街。
    你告诉我一个女孩子走路时不可旁若无人地唱歌；笑的时候不可肆无忌惮；衣服不可一堆一个星期才洗一次……
    我真不明白为什么我们每个人有不同面孔穿不同的衣服却非要有一样的个性。
    不过，我还是感谢你对我说这些话。我只有你这么一个朋友，不像你，过个什么“三八”节也会有人寄来花花绿绿的明信片。有个叫门肯的美国人说他很少把认识不到十年的人视为知己。可我们，差不多一生下来就认识了，而“知己”两个字却总令我不舒服，我自己尚不清楚自己，又怎么能说别人知道？
    你为我算命，不用扑克牌也不用电脑？你让我画画，画山、水、路、树和太阳。我的那两棵树画得又高又茂盛，你高兴极了，说那代表我会有两个事业成功。你固执地相信有一天我会成为一个什么“家”。你替我买了稿纸圆珠笔；我只好坐在桌前，平日写得一手好信的我却一个字也挤不出来，在那儿抓头发，咬嘴唇，踢桌子。于是我不再虐待自己，拿起席慕蓉的《有一首歌》走到阳光下。呵，世上有这么美丽的文字，你何必还要辛辛苦苦地去挤？巴巴地求人家看？
    远远地，我看见你叹息似的目光。
    请不要责备我吧，朋友！我不是没有努力过，试图弄清自己是谁，应该干些什么，可有些事是你想弄清却总也弄不清的。
    也请你不要用任何词来形容我，说我像一片云一根草。一片云就是一片云，一根草就是一根草，而我，我就是我呀！
