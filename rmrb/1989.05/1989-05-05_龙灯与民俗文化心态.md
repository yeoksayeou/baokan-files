As the commercial economy rapidly develops in Wenzhou, the local folk culture has also become rich and diverse. Traditional folk activities such as dragon lanterns and dragon boat races still hold an enduring charm in the Wenzhou region. In Yongzhong Town of Ouhai County, a village with several hundred households, the cost of rolling dragon lanterns alone amounts to over 100,000 yuan. On the third day of the Lunar New Year, to welcome the rolling dragon lanterns, Yongzhong Town spends five to six hundred thousand yuan on firecrackers and fireworks. As I witnessed the magnificent and dazzling dragon lanterns moving through the streets and in front of buildings, I was deeply moved by the fusion of this traditional folk cultural activity with the rapidly developing new life brought by the commercial economy.

As a symbol of seeking social and personal prosperity, the rolling dragon lantern activity, imbued with a vague religious consciousness and primitive aesthetic taste, allows people to enjoy well-deserved entertainment after a year of hard work, undoubtedly playing a role in cultural and spiritual adjustment. However, it also contains deeper cultural implications: when people lack the ability to control their own destinies, the dragon, as a deity that controls clouds and rain, naturally becomes an object of worship. The farmers' sincere prayers and good wishes ensure that the dragon lantern folk tradition is passed down from generation to generation.

The image of the dragon lantern has also changed with the evolution of society and culture. The dragon's body, adorned with brocade and silk, shines brightly, with colorful ribbons fluttering and graceful dance movements, rising and falling in a swirl. This reflects the joyful faces of farmers who are living better and celebrating more vibrant festivals. The dragon's head no longer exudes the fierce and intimidating demeanor of the past, but instead radiates a joyful and sweet beauty. However, when modern spiritual civilization has not yet fully permeated people's minds, the surging commercial economy has already impacted the lives of Wenzhou people. Farmers still rely on divine blessings for their livelihoods and prosperity, a traditional notion that has not yet been dispelled. In the prosperous business towns of Yongjia Bridgehead and Lucheng in Lucheng County, professional households and supply and marketing personnel attribute their business success to divine blessings, often kneeling before deities and seeking oracles. Traditional culture has indeed been strongly impacted by modern culture. Today's farmers also understand that the dragon, as a symbol of religious worship, no matter how powerful its magic or divine might, cannot guarantee their eternal path to wealth. Worshipping the dragon can only be a manifestation of their inner good wishes.

However, it is worth considering that dragon lanterns, dragon boats, Buddhist temples, tombs, and cemeteries, as forms of traditional folk culture, have become a means for people to maintain psychological balance in the face of high-consumption lifestyles. They can be welcomed, absorbed, and integrated with modern culture in rural Wenzhou, but they also become a hindrance to the development of modern culture. From a cultural studies perspective, culture is a whole. Improving people's cultural literacy and the value of folk culture requires attention to the reconstruction of people's ideas and the overall effect of social cultural construction. Today, we are in an era of reform and opening up, and what we need is a healthy and progressive folk culture that promotes new lifestyles, new ways of thinking, and new value systems. We must optimize folk culture through inheritance and guide it towards progress. Only when spiritual civilization and material civilization develop in harmony can we achieve the synchronous progress of farmers' folk culture and overall social culture.

　　龙灯与民俗文化心态
    章方松
    随着商品经济迅速发展起来的温州人，民俗文化也趋向于丰富多彩。作为民俗的龙灯、龙舟在温州地区仍然具有不衰的魅力。在瓯海县永中镇一个数百户的地方，仅滚龙灯就要花费十万多元。仅仅正月初三晚上，为迎接滚来的龙灯，永中镇放掉的鞭炮、火花费就要五、六万元。当我目睹着楼房前、街心中，滚动着辉煌绚丽、腾云驾雾的龙灯时，这种传统民俗文化活动和商品经济迅速发展的新生活糅合在一起的现象，激起了我深深的思索。
    作为一种祈求社会与人的生活祥瑞的象征，带着朦胧宗教意识和原始审美情趣的滚龙灯活动，使人们在繁忙了一年后，享受应得的娱乐，无疑会起到文化精神的调剂作用。但这里面还蕴涵着深层文化的意味：当人们还没有控制自己命运的能力时，龙作为调云行雨的神明，自然成为受崇拜的象征物。农民们虔诚的祈求和善良的心愿使滚龙灯的民俗代代相传。
    龙灯的形象也随着社会文化的变革有了新的变化。披锦挂缎的龙身，遍体光彩耀眼，彩绸飘飞，舞姿翩翩，起伏旋转。这与生活渐富节日过得火热的农民笑脸相辉映，那龙头也隐退了往昔气势汹汹，威武吓人的神态，流露出喜气洋洋、温和甜蜜的美感！可是，当现代精神文明还没有完全渗透到人们的头脑中的时候，如潮猛涨的商品经济已冲击到温州人的身边。而农民们把命运生存、发家致富依赖于神明保佑，恩泽布施人间的传统观念还没有得到融解。在商品生产经营繁荣的永嘉桥头镇和乐清柳市，专业户和供销员们把生意的兴隆，寄托于神明，决事往往是跪拜在神明面前，求签照应。传统文化毕竟受到了强大的现代文化的冲击，现代商品生产中的农民毕竟重视商品市场信息，经营管理方式，商品质量提高，社会信息的沟通等。其实，今天的农民也明白龙作为一种崇拜的宗教象征符号，即使法术、神威再大，终难以保佑永远注定他们发财致富的门路。崇拜龙，只能作为内心善良愿望的一种寄托而已。
    可是，值得我们思考的是，龙灯、龙舟、佛门庙宇，墓坟陵园作为一种传统民俗文化的表现形式，在温州地区趋向于高消费的生活方式面前，成为人们维持心理天平均衡的一种东西，它能和现代文化一起在温州农村受到欢迎、吸收并交融，却成为现代文化发展的一股惰力。从文化学角度认识，文化是一个整体，提高人的文化素质和民俗文化的价值，必须重视人的观念重构和社会文化建设的整体效应。今天，我们处于改革、开放的年代，需要的是健康进步的民俗，促进人们新的生活方式和新的思维方式、价值观点的构建。使民俗文化在传承中得到优化，导人民俗进步的轨道。唯有精神文明与物质文明发展相适应的协调发展，才能达到农民民俗文化与社会整体文化的同步前进。
