Guangzhou cleans up "private room" companies, finding over half engaged in illegal activities

		Guangzhou, May 25 (Xinhua) -- Since last month, Guangzhou's industrial and commercial administration departments have been conducting a cleanup and rectification of 460 "private room" companies (enterprises) operating within 21 hotels and inns. It has been found that illegal business activities are quite serious.

		Most of these "private room" companies (enterprises) do not have signboards and have been operating long-term within hotels and inns, conducting business negotiations. Their business scope is very broad, and they engage in a wide range of business activities.

		After an initial cleanup and rectification, it was discovered that over 50% of these "private room" companies (enterprises) are engaged in illegal business activities. Some are involved in the illegal resale of high-end household appliances, some illegally import scarce commodities or illegally export cotton textiles, and some engage in large-scale fraudulent activities.
