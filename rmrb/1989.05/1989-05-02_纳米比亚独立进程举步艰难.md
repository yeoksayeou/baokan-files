Namibia's independence process has been underway for over a month, but the first step has not yet been fully taken, and the international community is deeply concerned and anxious.

According to United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence, the first step is for a complete ceasefire across Namibia, but this has not yet been fully achieved. On April 1, as the people of Namibia gathered to celebrate the start of the independence process, gunshots rang out in northern Namibia. South African troops clashed with the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) guerrillas, resulting in nine days of conflict with over 200 SWAPO fighters killed and dozens of South African troops also losing their lives. After negotiations mediated by the UN Secretary-General, the "Three-Party Committee" of South Africa, Angola, and Cuba reconvened and agreed to resume the ceasefire starting April 10. However, by the end of April, South African troops and SWAPO guerrillas clashed again in northern Namibia, causing further casualties.

Reports indicate that the South African authorities have deployed 5,000 security forces to pursue the remaining 200 to 400 SWAPO fighters still in Namibia, which could further deteriorate the situation.

The focus of the struggle between South Africa and SWAPO during Namibia's independence process is the November 1 election. The armed conflict in northern Namibia in April was a prelude to this struggle. Throughout the transition period, the South African colonial authorities remain the administrative authority in the territory, especially before the election. South African troops (although their numbers will gradually decrease) and police still control this land, which is a product of mutual concessions among the relevant parties. Reports indicate that SWAPO is deeply concerned about this situation and has mobilized a large number of fighters to cross the border, hoping to maintain a certain level of armed force in northern Namibia to counter the military and police forces of the South African colonial authorities, thereby reducing their influence over the election. However, the South African authorities cannot tolerate this and, with their superior armed forces, have attacked SWAPO's combat forces.

The South African colonial authorities have also taken the opportunity to persecute Namibian civilians who support SWAPO under the pretext of hunting down SWAPO guerrillas, threatening them not to support SWAPO in the election. Reports indicate that South African troops and the "counter-insurgency forces" have entered many villages in northern Namibia, demanding that villagers vote for the pro-South African "Democratic Turnhalle Alliance" in the election. When some villagers raised their fists in salute (SWAPO's salute, symbolizing unity and struggle) to express their support for SWAPO, they were beaten.

The United Nations is making every effort to mediate and prevent the situation in Namibia from worsening. Today, the UN Secretary-General's special representative, Altiari, issued a statement in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia, calling on both South Africa and SWAPO to exercise maximum restraint, stop armed conflicts, and quickly resume the ceasefire. The UN peacekeeping force of 4,650 personnel has arrived in Namibia and is deploying across the country. They have played a beneficial role in protecting SWAPO fighters from interrogation by South African troops and ensuring their safe return to Angola. People hope that they will also play a role in supervising the conduct of free and fair elections in Namibia.

The path to independence and the realization of peace is the will of the people and the inevitable trend. Overall, the relevant parties to the Namibia issue will continue to implement the peace agreement. UN officials estimate that the scheduled election on November 1 will not be postponed, and formal independence on April 1, 1990, will not be delayed. However, conflicts and struggles are inevitable. The current difficulties indicate that the road to independence over the next 11 months will still be bumpy.

### 纳米比亚独立进程举步艰难

　　纳米比亚独立进程举步艰难
    本报记者  刘开宸
    纳米比亚的独立进程已逾一个月了，但第一步尚未完全迈开，国际社会对此深为关切，也很焦急。
    根据联合国安理会关于纳米比亚独立的４３５号决议，第一步是纳米比亚全境正式停火，但迄今未能完全实现。４月１日，正当纳米比亚人民集会庆祝独立进程开始之时，纳米比亚北部响起了枪声，南非军队与西南非洲人民组织（简称人组）游击队发生了武装冲突，连续９天，游击队死亡２００余人，南非军队也有数十人死亡。后经联合国秘书长调停，南非、安哥拉、古巴“三方委员会”又开会协商，１０日起恢复停火，但４月底，南非军队与人组游击队又在纳米比亚北部发生了武装冲突，又造成了人员伤亡。
    据报道，南非当局现在出动５０００名保安部队正在追剿尚留在纳米比亚境内的２００名—４００名人组战士，可能使局势继续恶化。
    纳米比亚独立过程中，南非和西南非人组斗争的焦点是１１月１日的大选。而４月间纳米比亚北部的武装冲突是双方在大选前一种斗争。在整个过渡时期内，南非殖民当局仍是该领土的行政当局，特别是在大选前，南非军队（虽然人数会逐渐减少）和警察仍然控制着这块领土，这是有关几方相互妥协的产物。据报道，西南非人组对这种状况深为担心，调动大批战士越境，希望在纳米比亚北部保持一定的武装力量，与南非殖民当局的军、警力量对抗，以减少南非殖民当局左右大选的影响。但是南非当局对此不能容忍，挟其装备精良的优势兵力，袭击西南非人组的有生力量。
    南非殖民当局还趁机以搜捕西南非人组游击队为借口，迫害支持人组的纳米比亚平民，威胁他们不得在大选中支持人组。据报道，南非军队和“抗暴部队”到纳米比亚北部许多村庄里，要村民在大选中投票支持亲南非的“特恩哈尔民主联盟”，当一些村民握起拳头敬礼（人组的敬礼手势，表示团结斗争）表示支持西南非人组时，就遭到毒打。
    联合国正在尽力斡旋，防止纳米比亚局势恶化。今天，联合国秘书长特别代表阿蒂萨利在纳米比亚首府温得和克发表声明，呼吁南非和人组都采取最大的克制态度，停止武装冲突尽快恢复停火。联合国维持和平部队４６５０人已抵纳米比亚，正在全境部署，在保护人组战士免受南非军队审问和安全返回安哥拉等方面都起了有益的作用。人们期望，他们在监督纳米比亚实行自由和公正的选举方面，也能起到作用。
    走向独立，实现和平，是人心所向，大势所趋。从总的情况看，纳米比亚问题的有关各方，还是要继续执行和平协定的。联合国的官员估计，预定的１１月１日举行大选不致延期，明年４月１日正式独立不致拖延，但矛盾和斗争势所难免。现在举步艰难预示着今后１１个月的独立道路上仍会坎坷不平。
