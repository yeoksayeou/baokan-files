On the morning of April 9, I went to get a haircut and found a small hair salon near Beijing's Shuangyushu. As someone deeply immersed in scientific research, I often pay little attention to matters outside of my field. I didn't even look at the name of the salon before entering. A female staff member applied shampoo to my hair and scrubbed it in. The shampoo flowed down my neck. After washing, a male barber cut my hair. After blow-drying, the male barber took out a plastic bottle and tried to pour something onto my head. I asked him not to apply that substance, but he ignored me. Later, he said the haircut was done. When I looked in the mirror, I saw hair clippings all over my neck. I asked the male barber to brush them off, but he didn't pay attention. I then asked a female staff member to help me brush off the hair clippings. She took a wet towel and wiped my neck a few times, then said it was done.

I asked, "How much does it cost?" The male barber said, "10 yuan." I was shocked: "Why 10 yuan?" The male barber said, "5 yuan for the haircut, 2 yuan for the shampoo, and 3 yuan for the hair oil." I thought I had been tricked. What should I do? I was hesitating when the male barber spoke up: "Pay up quickly. If you don't pay 10 yuan, you can't leave." I argued with him. At that moment, a man in his thirties entered from outside. Everyone inside called him "boss." After he came in, he said, "If you can't afford a haircut, don't come in." Seeing their bad attitude, I said, "I didn't ask for the oil, so I won't pay for it." I then left 7 yuan and tried to leave. At this point, the person called the boss grabbed my collar, and a young man guarding the door also came to grab me, punching and kicking me.

They were beating me when an elderly person rushed in from outside. If it weren't for this elderly person's timely intervention, I don't know what state I would have been left in. The elderly person advised me to pay the money and leave quickly, saying that it was pointless to reason with these people. I listened to the elderly person's advice, paid the remaining 3 yuan, and they finally let me go. I looked outside and saw that the salon was named Yingfeng Hair Salon.

I returned to my dormitory and looked in the mirror. I had a purple bump over 3 centimeters long on my head, and my right hand's two fingers were swollen, with one area bleeding. I was heartbroken...

　　我在颖峰发屋的遭遇
    ４月９日上午，我去理发，在北京双榆树附近找到一个小理发店。像我这种沉心于科学研究的人，对科学研究以外的事往往马马虎虎。我也没看是什么发屋，就进去了。一个女服务员给我上洗发液，一阵搓揉，发液顺着我的脖子往下流。洗完了，一个男理发员给我剪发。剪完发吹过风后，男理发员拿起一个塑料瓶子要往我头上倒什么东西，我要求男理发员不要上那种东西。可是他不听，过后他说理完发了。我对着镜子一看，满脖子都是头发渣，便要求男理发员给我掸掉，但他不理。我又要求一位女服务员帮我掸掉头发渣，那位女服务员拿起湿漉漉的毛巾往我脖子里塞了几下，然后说好了。
    我问：“师傅，要多少钱？”男理发员说，“１０元。”我惊呆了：“怎么要１０元？”男理发员说：“剪发５元，洗发２元，上发油３元。”我想这下上当了，怎么办呢？我正犹豫着。男理发员开腔了：“快掏钱，不给１０元就别想出门。”我与他争了起来。这时，从外面走进一个３０多岁的男子，里边的人都叫他头儿。那男子进来后说：“你理不起发就别进来。”我见他们态度不好，就说：“我没有要求上油，上油费我不给。”说完我放下７元钱就要走。这时，被称理发店的头儿一把抓住我的衣领，门口把门的小青年也上来抓住我，对我拳打脚踢。
    他们正打时，从外面冲进来一个老者。如果不是这位老者及时劝阻，不知道我会被他们打成什么样子。老者劝我交了钱快走，说和这些人无法讲理。我听了老者的话，又交出了３元钱，他们这才放我出来。我出来一看，那发屋名叫颖峰发屋。
    我回到宿舍对着镜子一看，头上一个３厘米多长的紫包已经起来，右手两个手指开始肿胀，一处被划出了血。我伤心极了……
