Nearly 40,000 officers to transfer to civilian positions this year
Placement policy remains largely unchanged with some adjustments

Labor and Personnel Minister Zhao Dongwen said at the national conference on the placement of demobilized military officers that the policy for placing demobilized military officers in 1989 remains largely unchanged, with some adjustments.

Zhao Dongwen said that with the approval of the State Council and the Central Military Commission, the placement of demobilized military officers this year will generally follow the existing regulations, with some specific policies adjusted.

He introduced that regarding the placement destinations of demobilized officers, the principle remains that the original province, autonomous region, or municipality directly under the Central Government is responsible for placement. The regulations have been adjusted to provide more consideration for officers with higher ranks, longer service, and significant contributions. There are also appropriate restrictions on the placement of younger, grassroots-level officers in large cities across provinces and regions. Emphasis is placed on treating officers at the division and corps levels as the key focus for demobilization and placement.

Zhao Dongwen pointed out that the decision by the State Council and the Central Military Commission to adjust the placement policy for demobilized officers is made to adapt to the requirements of rectification and deepening reform, to stabilize the army, and to maintain overall stability and unity. It fully reflects the Party and the state's care for demobilized officers.

It is understood that in 1989, nearly 40,000 military officers will be demobilized, including nearly 7,000 at the division and corps levels.

　　今年近四万军官转业    
    安置政策总体不变局部调整
    新华社北京５月６日电  （记者揭衍珍、费强）劳动人事部部长赵东宛在全国军队转业干部安置工作会议上说，１９８９年军队转业干部安置政策总体不变，局部有调整。
    赵东宛说，经国务院、中央军委批准，今年军队转业干部安置工作原则上仍执行现行的规定，同时对一些具体政策作了局部调整。
    他介绍说，关于转业干部的安置去向，原则上仍由原籍或入伍时所在的省、自治区、直辖市负责安置，增加了对职务较高、服役时间较长，贡献较大的转业干部要给予照顾的规定；对年纪较轻的基层干部跨省、区进大城市安置作了适当限制；强调要把师团职干部作为转业安置的重点。
    赵东宛指出，国务院、中央军委作出的关于局部调整转业干部安置政策的决定，是从适应治理整顿、深化改革的要求，从有利于稳定部队，从有利于维护安定团结这个大局出发的，充分体现了党和国家对转业干部的关怀。
    据悉，１９８９年全军有近４万名干部转业，其中师团职干部近７０００名。
