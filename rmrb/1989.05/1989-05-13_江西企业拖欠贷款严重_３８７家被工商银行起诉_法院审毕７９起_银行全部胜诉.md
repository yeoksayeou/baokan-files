	Jiangxi Province's banks have begun to use legal means to protect the safety of their loans. Since last year, 387 enterprises in the province have been sued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank for failing to repay loans on time, with a total overdue loan amount of 36.16 million yuan. The courts have accepted 323 cases, concluded 79, and the bank has won all of them.

	For a long time, banks have found it easy to lend to enterprises but difficult to recover the loans, causing significant losses to the state's credit funds. Last year, the Jiangxi Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank established a "Regulations and Laws Group" to train officials in this area for various local, municipal, and county branches, beginning to promote litigation activities for deposit and loan disputes across the province. As of now, the sued enterprises include 34 state-owned, 222 collective, and 131 individual enterprises.

	The initiation of litigation activities has effectively enhanced enterprises' awareness of repaying loans, forcing them to find ways to repay on time. Statistics show that since this year, enterprises with accounts in the Jiangxi Industrial and Commercial Bank system have repaid overdue loans totaling 107 million yuan, with guarantee units repaying 4.63 million yuan of overdue loans.

　　江西企业拖欠贷款严重  ３８７家被工商银行起诉       
    法院审毕７９起　银行全部胜诉
    新华社南昌５月１３日电（记者杨健、通讯员建丘）江西省各级银行开始借助法律武器保护贷款的安全。去年以来，这个省３８７家企业因贷款到期不归还，分别受到省内工商银行的起诉，这批逾期贷款总金额为３６１６万元。法院现已受理３２３起，审毕７９起，银行全部胜诉。
    长期以来，银行向企业贷款易放难收，给国家信贷资金造成很大损失。去年，工商银行江西省分行专门成立“条例法律小组”，为各地、市、县支行培养这方面的干部１３０多名，开始在全省推开存、贷纠纷的诉讼活动。到目前止，被起诉的企业，有国营３４家，集体２２２家，个体１３１家。
    诉讼活动的开展，有效地增强了企业的还贷观念，迫使企业想方设法按期还款。据统计，今年以来，全省工商银行系统开户企业共归还逾期贷款１．０７亿元，由贷款担保单位代还逾期贷款４６３万元。
