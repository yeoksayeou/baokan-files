Inside the glass building of the Swedish Consumer Cooperative Association's headquarters, the reporter saw a large photograph of a shiny herring on the wall, with the words: "We started with a barrel of herring."

The project manager, Oscar Sand, introduced to the reporter that the first consumer cooperative in Sweden was established in 1850 in a small town in central Sweden. At that time, most people were still in poverty. Out of necessity, people sometimes had to buy on credit from stores or exchange clothes for food. A few households in this town did not want to be exploited by middlemen, so they pooled their money to buy a barrel of herring from fishermen at a much cheaper price than in stores. Thus, the first consumer cooperative in Sweden was born, and it quickly spread. Today, Sweden's consumer cooperatives have developed rapidly, but the principle of "mutual aid and improving life" established at the beginning has remained unchanged.

Today, this association has become a group enterprise consisting of 130 cooperatives, with more than 30,000 employees and an annual sales volume of 38 billion kronor (approximately 6 billion US dollars). In terms of sales volume, it is ranked as the sixth-largest enterprise in Sweden. The scale of this association is still expanding, and in January of this year, it purchased three more companies. Currently, it accounts for 16% of Sweden's food industry and 20.9% of daily necessities sales.

In fierce competition, why can the cooperative association, which is neither state-owned nor privately owned, stand unshakable?

Oscar Sand's answer is simple: rely on the democratic management mechanism.

He introduced that the fundamental difference between cooperatives and private companies is that cooperatives are collectively owned by members, and their operating policy is "to serve members rather than exploit them." All activities must be supervised by members.

Anyone who voluntarily joins the cooperative association only needs to pay a membership fee of 50 kronor (approximately 7 US dollars) per year. The membership fee can also be paid more, but the rights enjoyed are equal. Each member is both a consumer and an owner of the cooperative. The highest authority of the cooperative association is the members' representative assembly composed of 200 representatives. These representatives are elected by the members' assemblies of 15 regions. The main work of the members' representative assembly is to propose suggestions from the regional members' assemblies and the previous board of directors, determine new business development directions, and decide on new board members. Daily operations are led by the board of directors.

Oscar Sand, pointing to the display case with more than a dozen items in simple blue and white packaging, said: "At a members' representative assembly, many people proposed that prices should be further reduced, and one suggestion was that some commonly used items could reduce advertising and packaging costs, use simple packaging, and increase the quantity per item." The cooperative launched more than 80 commonly used items, all packaged in blue and white. Due to the reduction in price but without affecting the quality, it is very popular among middle and lower-class customers, and it also forces private stores to lower the prices of similar items. The cooperative association also adopted members' suggestions: it was the first in Sweden to introduce self-service stores and supermarkets. With the enhancement of environmental awareness, the cooperative took the lead in supplying "vegetables and fruits without chemical fertilizers, meat without hormones, and eggs laid in open-air chicken coops," and attached prominent labels to these items, which are very competitive. In addition, the cooperative has made many efforts in ensuring supply, improving service quality, and strengthening advertising, making it advantageous in competition.

The various consumer cooperatives and factories under the cooperative association are economically independent and do not differ much from private companies in specific management, but in operating policies, they must follow the members' representative assembly and accept the leadership and supervision of the board of directors. When developing business, the cooperative also considers increasing profits, but the purpose is to develop production and reduce members' consumption expenses.

Initially, cooperative stores only supplied members, but later changed to be open to all customers. Each cooperative store has two types of prices: members can enjoy preferential prices with certificates, and at the end of the year, members can also get a 5% to 10% rebate based on the store's profit and purchase vouchers. Because the prices of cooperative stores are usually cheaper than private stores, and the quality and service level can be guaranteed, they are very attractive to general customers. The cooperative has played an active role in stabilizing market prices and reducing private capital's monopoly on consumer goods. The current membership of the Consumer Cooperative Association is over 2 million, and together with other consumer cooperatives, the total number is over 4 million, almost half of Sweden's total population.

### 瑞典的消费者合作社为何受群众欢迎？请看：  从一桶鲱鱼起家的合作社

　　瑞典的消费者合作社为何受群众欢迎？请看：  
    从一桶鲱鱼起家的合作社
    本报记者  顾耀铭
    在瑞典消费者合作社协会总部的玻璃大厦内，记者看到墙上挂着一幅银光闪闪的鲱鱼大照片，上面写着：“我们最初是从一桶鲱鱼起家的。”
    合作社协会的项目经理奥斯卡桑向记者介绍，瑞典第一个消费者合作社是一八五○年在瑞典中部的一个小镇建立起来的。当时多数人还处于贫困状态。迫于生活，人们有时不得不到商店赊帐，或拿衣物去换取食品。这个镇上的几户居民不愿受中间商的盘剥，就联合起来筹钱向渔民买了一桶鲱鱼，价格远比商店的便宜。于是，瑞典第一个消费者合作社产生了，而且很快就得到了推广。今天，瑞典的消费者合作社规模发展得很快，然而最初建立时确定的“互助合作，改善生活”的原则却始终没有变。
    今天这个协会已成为拥有三万多名雇员、年销售额达三百八十多亿克朗（约合六十多亿美元）、由一百三十家合作社组成的集团企业。按销售额计算，它被列为瑞典第六大企业。这个协会的规模还在扩大，今年一月又购买了三家公司。目前，它已占有瑞典食品工业的百分之十六，日用品销售的百分之二十点九。
    在激烈的竞争中，既非国营，又非私营的合作社协会为何能立于不败之地？
    奥斯卡桑经理的回答很简单：依靠民主管理机制。
    他介绍，合作社同私营公司的根本不同点是它为社员集体所有，它的经营方针是“为社员提供服务，而不是剥削”，一切活动都要接受社员的监督。
    凡自愿加入合作社协会的人每年只需交五十克朗（约合七美元）的会费。会费也可以多交，但是享受的权利是同等的。每个社员既是消费者，又是合作社的拥有者。合作社协会的最高权力机构是由二百名代表组成的社员代表大会。这些代表是由十五个地区的社员大会选举产生的。社员代表大会的主要　　　　　　地区社员会议提出的建议和上届理　
　　工作，确定新的业务发展方针并决定新的理事会的人选。日常业务由理事会负责领导。
    奥斯卡桑经理指着陈列柜里十几件用蓝白双色简易包装的商品，说：“在一次社员代表大会上，不少人提出应该进一步降低商品价格，其中一个建议是一些常用商品可以减少广告和包装费，用简易包装，件量增大。”合作社就推出八十多种一律用蓝白色包装的常用商品。由于降低了价格，但质量不受影响，很受中下层顾客的欢迎，而且促使私营商店的同类商品价格也不得不下跌。合作社协会还采纳了社员的建议：在瑞典首创了自选商店和超级市场。随着人们环境意识的增强，合作社又率先供应“不上化肥的水果蔬菜，不含激素的肉类，在露天鸡场下的蛋”，并在这些商品外层贴上醒目的标签，很有竞争力。此外，合作社在保证货源供应、提高服务质量、加强广告宣传等方面都作了很多努力，使其在竞争中处于优势。
    合作社协会所属的各个消费者合作社和工厂在经济上都是独立核算，在具体管理方面同私营公司差别不大，但在经营方针上要服从社员代表大会，并接受理事会的领导和监督。合作社在发展业务时也要考虑增加利润，但目的是为了发展生产和降低社员的消费开支。
    最初，合作社商店仅供应社员，后来改为向所有顾客都开放。每个合作社商店有两种价格，社员凭证可以享受优惠价，而且年底根据商店盈利的多少，社员凭购货单还可以得到百分之五到百分之十的回扣。由于合作社商店的价格通常比私营商店便宜，而且质量和服务水平都能保证，因此对一般顾客都很有吸引力。合作社在稳定市场价格，减少私人资本对消费品的垄断方面都发挥了积极作用。消费者合作社协会目前的会员已达二百多万，加上其它消费者合作社的人数，总计为四百多万，几乎占瑞典总人口的一半。　（附图片）
