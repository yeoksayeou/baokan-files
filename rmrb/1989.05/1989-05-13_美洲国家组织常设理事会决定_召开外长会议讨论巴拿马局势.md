The Permanent Council of the Organization of American States yesterday unanimously decided to hold an emergency meeting of foreign ministers on May 17th to discuss the Panama crisis. This motion was proposed by Venezuela.

During the meeting, representatives from some countries criticized the Panamanian government's decision to cancel the elections but opposed any form of intervention in Panama, particularly military intervention. They emphasized the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of member states as stipulated in the OAS Charter.

U.S. representative William Pulitzer stated that President Bush has clearly expressed the intention to seek a solution to the Panama crisis through the Organization of American States. He once again accused the Panamanian authorities, with the support of Noriega, of stealing the election results through fraud and intimidation.

Panamanian representative Carlos Russel accused the United States of plotting an invasion of Panama. He listed the six measures Bush had announced against Panama, including the deployment of 2,000 soldiers, indicating that Panama was under the threat of a U.S. military operation.

    本报加拉加斯５月１３日电  记者朱满庭报道：美洲国家组织常设理事会昨天一致决定１７日召开一次紧急外交部长会议讨论巴拿马危机，这项动议是委内瑞拉提出的。
    会议中，一些国家代表批评了巴拿马政府取消大选的决定，但反对对巴拿马进行任何形式的干涉，尤其是军事干涉，强调美洲国家组织宪章中不干涉各成员国内部事务的原则。
    美国代表威廉·普利策说，布什总统已清楚地表明了美国想通过美洲国家组织寻求解决巴拿马危机的办法的意图，他再次指责巴拿马当局在诺列加的支持下以作弊和恫吓的手段窃取大选结果。
    巴拿马代表卡洛斯·鲁塞尔指责美国策划对巴拿马进行侵略的活动，他列数了布什对巴拿马宣布采取的６点措施，其中包括派遣２０００名士兵的举动，指出巴拿马已处在美国的一次军事行动的威胁下。
