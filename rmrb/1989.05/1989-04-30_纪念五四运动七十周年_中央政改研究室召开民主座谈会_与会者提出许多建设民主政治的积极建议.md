In the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the Central Committee's Political System Reform Research Office recently held five democratic discussion meetings. Nearly 30 people from various sectors expressed their views freely, seriously analyzing the current state of democratic political construction in our country and putting forward many positive suggestions for building a democratic political system.

The attendees believed that since the May Fourth Movement, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of the entire nation fought for 30 years to gain democratic rights and establish the People's Republic of China. In the 40 years since the founding of the nation, the Communist Party has led the people in building socialist democracy. Especially since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, through rectification and reform, our country's democratic political construction has made significant progress. However, there are still many areas that are not satisfactory. We should recognize the necessity and urgency of developing socialist democratic politics, starting from the actual situation of our primary stage of socialism, taking practical and feasible measures, and steadily and solidly promoting democratic political construction step by step.

During the discussion, many comrades emphasized the importance of achieving democratic and scientific decision-making, believing that this is the fundamental way to reduce decision-making errors and ensure the smooth development of national reform and modernization construction. Some comrades said that to achieve democratic and scientific decision-making, it is also necessary to standardize the decision-making process. Making an important decision should go through the prescribed procedures and steps. It is important to seriously listen to the opinions of people from all sides, especially to seriously listen to different opinions and to study and compare different schemes.

During the discussion, many people suggested improving and perfecting the People's Congress system. They said that in recent years, the People's Congress system has been playing an increasingly important role in our country's political life, which is evident to all. However, at the same time, some problems that need to be seriously considered have emerged, such as the number of people's representatives being too large, the meeting time being too short, and the discussion not being thorough enough, all of which need to be improved.

Some comrades hope to further play the role of the Political Consultative Conference in "political consultation and democratic supervision," believing that the Political Consultative Conference is an important channel for reflecting the opinions of all sides. The work of the Political Consultative Conference also needs to gradually realize institutionalization.

Some comrades emphasized the importance of grassroots democratic construction. They proposed that after the implementation of the "Enterprise Law," enterprises have shown some new features, and the task of democratic construction is even heavier. While supporting enterprise managers to play their roles boldly, it is necessary to fully play the role of the workers' congress and the broad masses of workers.

Many comrades suggested accelerating the legislation related to citizens' rights to ensure the implementation of the rights and freedoms of citizens as stipulated in the Constitution, and at the same time, to legally restrict the abuse of rights and freedoms.

During the discussion, many comrades pointed out that the construction of democratic politics should be carried out on the track of the rule of law. At present, it is very urgent to establish and strengthen the authority of the law.

The attendees unanimously believed that commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and carrying forward the spirit of science and democracy of the May Fourth Movement, we need to respect knowledge, attach importance to education, strengthen the exchange and understanding between the Party and intellectuals, so that the people of the whole country can unite as one and make joint efforts for reform and opening up and modernization construction.

　　纪念五四运动七十周年    
    中央政改研究室召开民主座谈会 
    与会者提出许多建设民主政治的积极建议
    本报北京４月３０日讯  记者王礼明报道：最近，在五四运动七十周年前夕，中共中央政治体制改革研究室连续召开５次民主座谈会。近３０名各方面人士在会上各抒己见，畅所欲言，认真分析了我国民主政治建设的现状，提出了许多有利于建设民主政治的积极建议。
    与会同志认为，五四运动以来，全国人民在中国共产党领导下，用三十年时间争得了民主权利，建立了中华人民共和国；建国四十年，中国共产党又领导全国人民建设社会主义民主，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，经过拨乱反正和改革创新，我国的民主政治建设有了很大发展，但仍有很多不尽如人意的地方。我们应该认识发展社会主义民主政治的必要性和紧迫性，从我们社会主义初级阶段的实际情况出发，采取切实可行的措施，稳步扎实、循序渐进地推进民主政治建设。
    在座谈中，不少同志强调实现决策民主化、科学化的重要性，认为这是减少决策失误、保证国家改革和现代化建设顺利发展的根本途径。有的同志说，要实现决策民主化、科学化，还必须做到决策程序化。作出一项重要决策，要经过哪些层次和步骤，都应有法定的程序加以规范。要认真听取各方面人士的意见，特别是认真听取不同意见，研究对比不同方案。
    座谈中，许多人建议要健全和完善人民代表大会制度。他们说，这几年来，人民代表大会制度在我国政治生活中正在发挥着越来越大的作用，这是有目共睹的。但同时也出现了一些应当认真考虑的问题，如人民代表人数过多，会议时间较短，议事不够充分等等，都有待改进。
    有的同志希望进一步发挥政协“政治协商，民主监督”的作用，认为政协是反映各方面意见的一个重要渠道。政协的工作也需要逐步实现制度化。
    有的同志强调基层民主建设的重要性。他们提出《企业法》实施后，企业出现了一些新面貌，民主建设的任务更重了，在支持企业经营者大胆发挥作用的时候，必须充分发挥职代会和广大职工的作用。
    许多同志建议加快有关公民权的立法，以保障宪法规定的公民权利和自由的切实实施，同时依法限制滥用权利和自由的行为。
    在座谈中，不少同志指出，建设民主政治应当在法制的轨道上进行。在当前情况下，建立和加强法律的权威是十分迫切的。
    与会同志一致认为，纪念五四运动七十周年，发扬五四科学民主精神，更需要尊重知识，重视教育，加强党和知识分子的交流和理解，以使全国人民团结一心，为改革开放和现代化建设共同作出努力。
