The African Development Bank's 25th annual meeting and the 25th anniversary celebration of the bank's establishment were held here today.

In his speech, the bank's president, Ndiyaye, first reviewed the history of the bank's establishment. He said: 25 years ago, newly independent African countries were full of hope for the future and determined to press ahead, but they faced the dual difficulties of insufficient funds and arduous tasks. The dream of establishing a pan-African bank not only came true, but its achievements even exceeded original expectations. He pointed out, "The 25 years since the establishment of the African Development Bank are 25 years of service to the African continent, 25 years of striving to fulfill its role to the utmost."

When the bank was established in 1964, it had only 25 member countries. Now it has grown to 75, including 50 African countries and 25 countries (regions) from Europe, America, and Asia. Its capital has increased from the initial $250 million to $21.8 billion. From 1967 to the end of last year, it has granted a total of 1,100 loans to African countries, amounting to $12.7 billion.

China formally joined the African Development Bank in May 1985, and the Chinese government delegation attended today's meeting.

    非行举行年会
    本报阿布贾5月29日电  记者杨汝生报道：非洲开发银行第25次年会和该行成立25周年庆祝活动今天在此间举行。
    非行行长恩迪亚耶在讲话中首先回顾了该行成立的历史，他说：25年前，刚刚获得独立的非洲国家对未来充满憧憬，决心继续前进，但却面临资金不足和任务艰巨的双重困难。成立一个全非性的银行的梦想不仅实现了，它所取得的成效甚至超出了原先的估计。他指出，“非洲开发银行成立的25年是它为非洲大陆服务的25年，是竭尽全力发挥其作用的25年。”
    1964年该行成立时只有25个成员国，现在已经发展到75个，除了50个非洲国家外，还有欧、美、亚洲的25个国家（地区）参加。它所拥有的股金已从开始时的2.5亿美元增加到218亿美元。自1967年至去年年底，它共向非洲国家发放了1100笔贷款，总金额为127亿美元。
    中国于1985年5月正式参加非洲开发银行，中国政府代表团参加了今天的大会。
