Overseas Chinese Population Approaches 30 Million

How many overseas Chinese are there? In the past, there has been no precise statistics. Recently, Cornell University in the United States collected and analyzed data from 132 countries and regions around the world, concluding that by the early 1980s, the number was approximately 27 million. This is a relatively authoritative and accurate figure.

The distribution of overseas Chinese is as follows: Asia has over 24 million, the Americas have over 2 million, Europe has over 400,000, Africa has over 100,000, and Oceania has over 200,000. The distribution in major countries is roughly: Indonesia 6 million, Malaysia 4.55 million, Thailand 4.5 million, Singapore 1.9 million, the Philippines 1.1 million, the United States 1 million, Vietnam 750,000, Burma 700,000, Canada 450,000, the United Kingdom 150,000, India 140,000, Australia 120,000, France 110,000, and Brazil 100,000. In these countries, over 90% of the Chinese have acquired the citizenship of the country they reside in.

    海外华人有多少？过去没有一个精确统计。美国康奈尔大学最近在汇集并分析了世界上１３２个国家和地区的资料，得出结论说，到８０年代初约为２７００万人。这是一个比较权威和准确的数字。
    海外华人的分布情况是：亚洲２４００多万，美洲２００多万，欧洲４０多万，非洲１０多万，大洋洲２０多万。在各主要国家的分布情况，大致是：印度尼西亚６００万，马来西亚４５５万，泰国４５０万，新加坡１９０万，菲律宾１１０万，美国１００万，越南７５万，缅甸７０万，加拿大４５万，英国１５万，印度１４万，澳大利亚１２万，法国１１万，巴西１０万。在这些国家，９０％以上的华人已加入所在国的国籍。
