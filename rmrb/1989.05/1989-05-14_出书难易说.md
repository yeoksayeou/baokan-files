Title: On the Ease and Difficulty of Publishing Books

The current opinion that "publishing books is difficult, and publishing academic works is even more difficult" is something I agree with. However, I would like to add that there are also situations where publishing books is easy, and publishing certain "academic" works is also easy. Moreover, the ease of publishing books is one of the reasons for the difficulty in publishing, although it is not the main reason.

In recent years, the number of books published in our country can be said to have increased at a running pace, with an annual output of over 60,000 titles, ranking fifth in the world. In terms of absolute numbers (not per capita), we have entered the ranks of the world's major publishing countries. Although, in the long run, this number is still far from meeting the objective needs, the prominent problem at present is that the quantity is increasing rapidly, while the quality is lagging behind. Many books, after being published, end up gathering dust in libraries, with no one taking an interest in them. In recent years, with the shrinking of the book market, some books, despite being printed in very small quantities, have also had difficulty leaving the bookstores. As soon as they are born, they are consigned to the "cold palace," and after a while, they are "written off." There are also some books whose sales are still acceptable, even bestsellers or hot sellers, but they are only popular for a short time, like a passing cloud, quickly fading away, with no value for reprinting. What is the significance of publishing more such books?

We know that books outlive people. "Any advanced thought and scientific cultural knowledge, once published in a book, can be passed down for a long time." However, the "short-lived books" of today, although there are cases where they are temporarily obscured due to blocked distribution channels, many books are simply lacking in quality. Whether they are mediocre, shoddy, repetitive, or vulgar and deceitful, they lack the "longevity" to be passed down. Among these books, there are naturally many vulgar, vulgar, and vulgar readings, but there are also many so-called academic works that lack academic value. Some books, even if they have a bit of "academic" content, take advantage of the convenience of many publishers, using the method of changing the appearance and title, repeatedly "reheating the leftovers." A book like this, just by tinkering with the content arrangement and title list, suddenly becomes five books, handed over to five publishers one after another. Isn't this too easy to publish?

The difficulty in publishing books, fundamentally speaking, lies in the lack of financial and material resources. Under such circumstances, it is even more necessary to use the limited material and printing resources on the "key points," on high-quality books, and on books with cultural accumulation significance that are "long-lived." Here, a full-frontal attack and equal treatment are not feasible, but rather, there should be "things to do and things not to do." Truly academically valuable works naturally belong to the category of "things to do," but for those manuscripts that use the banner of academia but have little academic value, they should be ruthlessly placed in the category of "things not to do." Only by not doing the latter and saving material and financial resources can we better practice doing the former. This is also the case for other types of manuscripts. Only by reducing the mediocre as much as possible can we benefit the birth of excellent works. Currently, some mediocre and inferior manuscripts are not too "difficult" to publish, but rather too "easy" to publish, which instead impacts the publication and distribution of high-quality excellent books. Therefore, I think that the opinion on "difficulty in publishing" also needs to be analyzed specifically. The persistent "difficulty" in producing books with scientific, cultural, academic, and artistic value is an unfortunate situation for the country's cultural industry; the overly "easy" production of shallow and mediocre books may also become a disaster for the country's cultural industry. Because, if it is too "easy," it loses the pursuit and the demand, which will lead to a decline in the overall level of cultural publishing. The word "difficult" is generally unwelcome, but when it should be "difficult" but is not, "difficulty" is also valuable.

　　出书难易说
    江曾培
    当前，“出书难，出学术著作更难”的舆论，我也是认同的。不过，我想补充说，同时也存在着出书易，出某些“学术”著作也易的情况。而且，出书易正是造成出书难的一个原因，尽管并非主要原因。
    这些年，我国的出书数量可以说是以跑步的速度在发展，年出书量已达六万多种，居世界第五位，就绝对数（不是人均数）说，已进入了世界出版大国的行列。虽然，长远地看，这一数量还远远不能满足客观需要，但目前突出的问题，是数量跑得较快，质量却显得蹒跚。有不少书出版后走进图书馆，就长年尘封，无人问津。近年随着图书市场的萎缩，有些书尽管印数少得可怜，但连书店也难于走出了，一出世就坐“冷宫”，挨以时日，“报销”了事。也有些书，销数还可以，甚至是畅销、热销，但也只是火红一时，犹如过眼烟云，迅即烟火飞灭，再没有什么重版的价值。这样的书出得再多，又有多少意义呢？
    我们知道，书比人长寿。“任何一种先进思想和科学文化知识，一经成书出版发行，就能传之久远。”而现在的“短命书”，虽有由于发行渠道阻塞而一时蒙尘的情形，但相当多的书，则因为自身缺乏质量，或平庸低劣，或粗制滥造，或重复雷同，或媚俗欺世，一无“传之久远”的生命力，因而无“寿”可言。这些书其中自然较多的是那些粗俗、鄙俗、庸俗的读物，但也不乏无学术的所谓学术著作。有些书即使有点薄薄的“学术”，有人却利用出版社众多之便，以改头换面的手法，反复“炒冷饭”，原有一点的鲜味变成了馊气。有这样一本书，就靠在内容排列次序与标题目录上做点手脚，一下变成五本，先后交给了五家出版社。这样的书不是出得过于容易了吗？
    出书难，从根本上说，是难在财力、物力的不足。在这种情况下，更需要将有限的物力、印刷力用在刀口上，用在高质量的图书上，用在具有文化积累意义的“长命书”上。这里，全线出击、一视同仁是不行的，而要“有所为，有所不为”。真正有学术价值的著作，自然应属“有所为”之列，但对那些打着学术旗号却并无多少学术可言的书稿，则需毫不留情地放入“有所不为”一档中。只有对后者的“有所不为”，节约了物力、财力，才能较好地实践对前者的“有所为”。这对其他方面的书稿也是这样。唯有尽量减少平庸的，才能有利于优秀的出生。目前，某些平庸低劣的书稿，不是出版太“难”，而是出版过“易”，反而冲击高质量的优秀图书出版发行。因此，我以为，对“出书难”的舆论，也要作点具体分析。具有科学文化、学术、艺术价值的图书，老是“难”产，是国家文化事业的不幸；浅陋平庸的图书，过于“易”生，恐怕也会成为国家文化事业的一种灾难。因为，过“易”了，就失去追求，失去要求，从而会带来整个文化出版水准的下落。“难”字，一般总是窘迫不受欢迎的，但应该“难”而不“难”的时候，“难”也可贵。
