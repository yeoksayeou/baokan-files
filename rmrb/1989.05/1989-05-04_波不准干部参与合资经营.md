Poland bans officials from engaging in joint ventures

	Xinhua News Agency Warsaw May 3 (Reporter Dong Fusheng) Polish government deputy spokesman Rekowski announced at a press conference on May 3 that Polish state officials do not and are not allowed to participate in various joint ventures or engage in business activities.

	It is understood that recently, the chairman of the Polish Trade Union National Council, Modowicz, had accused certain government members of investing in joint ventures. Rekowski made the above statement in response to such allegations.

	He also emphasized that the claim that the Polish authorities have agreed to long-term leasing of Polish land to West German businessmen is groundless. Poland has not done so and has no intention of doing so.

	When discussing the development of education, Rekowski said that the Polish government has agreed to the establishment of private schools. The Polish government hopes to promote various social initiatives.

　　波不准干部参与合资经营
    新华社华沙５月３日电（记者董福生）波兰政府副新闻发言人雷科夫斯基３日在记者招待会上宣布，波兰国家工作人员没有，也不准参加各种合资企业，从事经营活动。
    据了解，不久前波兰工会全国协议会主席苗多维奇曾指责某些政府成员入股参加了合资企业。雷科夫斯基正是针对这种说法作上述表示的。
    他同时强调，所谓波兰当局已同意向西德商人长期出租波兰土地的说法是毫无根据的。波兰没有这样做，也不准备这样做。
    在谈到发展教育问题时，雷科夫斯基说，波兰政府已经表示同意私人兴办学校。波兰政府希望发展各种社会首创精神。
