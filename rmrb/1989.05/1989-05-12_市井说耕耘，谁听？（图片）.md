Who Listens When the Marketplace Talks About Cultivation?

Since the first Civilized and Polite Month was launched eight years ago, "convenient services" have been promoted numerous times each year, often covering entire streets with great fanfare and enthusiasm. However, the results are questionable. Take, for example, the agricultural technology consultation service depicted in the image. If this were in a rural area, perhaps someone might inquire, but setting up a stall in the city, who would listen? No wonder it is so deserted. When will these labor-intensive and wasteful formalistic activities decrease? (Photographed on May 4th at the "Convenient Service Street" in Xichang City)  Han Binzhong

    市井说耕耘，谁听？
    从第一个文明礼貌月开展至今，8年了。“便民服务”年年数次，动辄一条街，很有声势，热热闹闹。可效果呢！令人生疑。如图中的农业技术咨询服务，如果在农村，也许还有人问津，可在城里设点铺摊，谁听？难怪如此冷落。劳民伤财的形式主义活动何时才能少点呢？（5月4日摄于西昌市“便民服务一条街”上）  韩滨中摄
