Starting from the leadership organs, Dingxi County in Gansu Province has taken the initiative to investigate issues with strong public concern, and has been pushing forward clean governance in a solid manner, promoting the improvement of party discipline.

According to a report by the Gansu Daily, Dingxi County has formulated regulations to strictly prohibit party and government officials from abusing power for personal gain, using public funds for banquets and gifts, and public-funded travel. It also prohibits party and government organs and officials from engaging in business and enterprise activities, strengthens supervision and inspection of party and government organs, and increases the transparency of work. Additionally, there are ten rules for maintaining integrity for officials at the county level and above. The party branch of the county agricultural bank established a "branch mailbox" to supervise party members in managing the "five key areas" of power use, money use, dining, personal relationships, and policy implementation, promoting self-education among party members. Since last year, the county committee has conducted four comprehensive and in-depth inspections on the implementation of the party discipline responsibility system by party organizations at all levels across the county, timely discovering and solving problems in the work, and overcoming weak links.

This county also pays attention to the method of commending the advanced and urging the backward to guide officials and party members at all levels to improve their awareness of maintaining integrity. Last year, the county carried out the selection of advanced party branches and outstanding party members in party organizations, commending and rewarding the deeds of 71 advanced party branches and 710 outstanding party members, with good results. This year, the county-wide selection of clean and upright party members and cadres in urban and rural areas has also achieved the effect of using nearby events to educate nearby people. At the same time, they started from the leading organs, and from issues with strong public concern. This year, they have successively investigated and dealt with the director of the audit bureau for abusing his power to embezzle workers' housing allowance and misappropriate 18,000 yuan of water conservancy construction funds; the director of the county economic commission for embezzling land management fees and fixed asset depreciation fees totaling 9,760 yuan; and the director of the county government office for using 3,800 yuan of land management fees to build a private house, among other issues of abusing power for personal gain. They also investigated and dealt with some township cadres for embezzling relief funds, over-planned births, dereliction of duty, refusal to be transferred, and some county-level units for issuing money and goods at will, violating financial discipline, and other issues. The timely investigation and handling of these issues have also effectively promoted the improvement of party discipline.
