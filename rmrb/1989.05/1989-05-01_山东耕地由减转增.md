Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, April 30th.

Shandong's arable land has turned from decrease to increase. A survey by relevant departments in Shandong Province shows that last year the province reclaimed 430,000 mu of land, exceeding the non-agricultural construction land by 131,000 mu. The situation of rapid decrease in arable land over many years has been reversed.

Previously, Shandong Province had been losing an average of 700,000 mu of arable land each year. Starting last year, the province implemented a policy of balancing land reclamation and conservation. Various levels of government have controlled the use of construction land through quotas and strict approval processes.

Last year, the number of units (households) and the area of land illegally occupied were both reduced by 91.2% and 87% respectively compared to the average from 1982 to 1986. The province allocated 400,000 mu of construction land quotas to various regions, and by the end of the year, 99,000 mu remained unused.
