	Ending the Past, Opening the Future
		Deng Xiaoping Meets Gorbachev; Both Sides Announce Normalization of Sino-Soviet Relations

		This morning, Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China, and Mikhail Gorbachev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, announced that relations between China and the Soviet Union have been normalized. Deng Xiaoping also told Gorbachev that tonight, you will meet with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, which means that relations between the two parties have also been normalized. Gorbachev agreed with this. At this moment, the two leaders, facing more than 100 Chinese and foreign journalists, shook hands warmly, and the meeting hall immediately erupted in applause.

		This historic meeting was held in the East Hall of the Great Hall of the People. When Gorbachev arrived at the door of the East Hall at 10:05 AM, Deng Xiaoping greeted him, saying, "I have been hoping to meet you for three years." Gorbachev replied, "I am very happy to meet you." Deng Xiaoping continued, "The world is very concerned about our meeting." He suggested that the two of them shake hands for the journalists to take photos, and then enter the meeting hall together.

		Deng Xiaoping said, "Three years ago, I asked Comrade Ceausescu to convey a message to you, hoping that the three major obstacles between China and the Soviet Union could be removed, and that we could meet and have a dialogue as soon as possible." Gorbachev said he remembered the matter and added that it had been a prompt for their thinking. Moreover, it seemed that everything had been done in a timely manner. Deng Xiaoping said, "Our meeting this time can be summarized in eight words: ending the past, opening the future." Gorbachev agreed with this.

		Deng Xiaoping pointed out that for a long time, the international situation we faced was very severe. The situation of the Cold War and confrontation had not eased. Frankly speaking, the central issue of the world is the US-Soviet relations. For a long time, the overall situation has been an arms race, with rising tensions. Comrade Gorbachev's speech in Vladivostok was seen by people all over the world and contained new content. At that time, there was no word like "new thinking."

		"Just as there was no phrase like 'new international political order' either," Gorbachev interjected.

		Deng Xiaoping continued, "At that time, we saw that the US-Soviet arms race might have a turning point, a way to resolve it, and that US-Soviet relations might shift from confrontation to dialogue. This is the hope of all mankind. This raised a question for the Chinese people: could Sino-Soviet relations be improved? It was out of this motivation that we sent you the message. More than three years have passed, and we have finally met." Gorbachev said, "You raised three obstacles, so it took three years, and each obstacle took a year."

		Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the key is that countries should be equal. He reviewed the history of foreign aggression, oppression, and land grabbing against old China, as well as the tortuous path that Sino-Soviet relations and the two parties had gone through in the past. He said, "Talking about history is to move forward on a more solid foundation. China will not invade other countries and does not pose a threat to any country. China is relatively poor, but it insists on independence and self-reliance."

		Gorbachev said that the Soviet side also admitted that it had made mistakes in the history of the deterioration of relations between the two sides. As for some historical issues, the situation is very complex. Although Chairman Deng's views are not without basis, the Soviet side still has some different views. The two leaders expressed that the past is past, and the focus is on looking forward and doing practical things in developing relations between the two countries.

		When talking about socialism, Gorbachev said that in the past, we thought that there was only one model of socialism, but reality has proven that this is not the case. In recent years, we have analyzed this issue. We are trying to implement Marxism-Leninism in real life according to the specific conditions of our country.

		Deng Xiaoping agreed with this. He said, "A true Marxist-Leninist must recognize, inherit, and develop Marxism-Leninism based on actual conditions. It is impossible to have a fixed model of socialism. The world situation, including the development of science and technology, is changing rapidly. If we do not use new ideas to inherit and develop Marxism-Leninism, it is not true Marxism-Leninism. Everything that is rigid and outdated will only lead to failure. Each country can only build socialism according to its own conditions."

		Gorbachev expressed that the Soviet Union is watching with great interest the developments in the People's Republic of China and has learned beneficial things from it.

		The two leaders also had an in-depth exchange of views on the Cambodian issue. Both sides have some common points, but have not completely reached an agreement. Both sides agreed that the foreign ministers of the two countries would continue to exchange views on this matter.

		The entire meeting was conducted in a friendly and candid atmosphere. The meeting lasted for two and a half hours. After the meeting, Deng Xiaoping hosted a luncheon for Gorbachev and his wife Raisa Gorbacheva.

		The main Soviet officials who accompanied Gorbachev and his wife attended the meeting and were invited to the banquet.

		Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Premier Yao Yilin, Wu Xueqian, Secretary of the Central Secretariat Yan Mingfu, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the meeting and the banquet. Mrs. Lin Jialin, wife of Chairman Li Xiannian, also attended the banquet.

　　结束过去　开辟未来    
    邓小平昨天同戈尔巴乔夫会晤  双方宣布中苏关系实现正常化
    本报北京５月１６日讯  记者周象光、温宪报道：今天上午，中共中央军委主席邓小平和苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫宣布，中苏两国关系实现了正常化。邓小平还对戈尔巴乔夫说，今晚，你还要同赵紫阳总书记见面，这意味着两党关系实现正常化。戈尔巴乔夫对此表示同意。此时，两位领导人面对着１００多位中外记者热烈握手，会见大厅内顿时响起一阵祝贺的掌声。
    这次历史性的会晤是在人民大会堂东大厅举行的。当戈尔巴乔夫１０点５分来到东大厅门前时，邓小平迎上前去说，我希望同你见面已经有三年了。戈尔巴乔夫说，能够同你见面，感到非常高兴。邓小平接着说，世界上都很关心我们的见面。他提议两人握手让记者们拍照，然后一同步入会晤大厅。
    邓小平说，三年前，我请齐奥塞斯库同志给你带口信，希望中苏之间能够消除三大障碍，早日实现我们之间的见面和对话。戈尔巴乔夫表示记得此事，并说，这对我们的思考是一个促进。而且，看起来一切都做得很及时。邓小平说，我们这次会晤，可以概括为八个字：结束过去，开辟未来。戈尔巴乔夫对此表示赞同。
    邓小平指出，长期以来，我们面临的国际形势是非常严峻的。冷战和对抗的局面一直没有得到缓和。坦率地说，世界的中心问题是美苏关系问题。长期以来，总的局势是军备竞赛，水涨船高。戈尔巴乔夫同志在海参崴的讲话全世界人民都看到了，有新内容。当时还没有“新思维”这个词。
    “好像也没有‘国际政治新秩序’这个词一样。”戈尔巴乔夫插话说。
    邓小平接着说，当时我们看到，美苏军备竞赛可能有一个转折，有一个解决的途径，美苏关系可能由对抗转向对话，这是全人类的希望。这就在中国人民面前提出了一个问题：中苏关系可不可以得到改善。出于这样的动机，才给你带信，时间过了三年多，我们才见了面。戈尔巴乔夫说，你提出了三个障碍，所以需要三年的时间，每一个障碍得需要一年的时间。
    邓小平强调说，关键是国家与国家要平等。他回顾了外国列强对旧中国的侵略、压迫和掠夺土地的历史，以及中苏两国、两党关系在过去所走过的一段曲折历程。他说，谈历史是为了在更坚实的基础上向前进。中国不会侵略别国，对任何国家都不构成威胁。中国比较贫穷，但坚持独立自主。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，对以前双方关系恶化的历史，苏方认为，自己方面也有过错。至于一些历史问题，情况很复杂，尽管邓主席的看法不是没有根据的，但苏方还有一些不同的看法。两位领导人表示，过去的事过去了，重点在于应该向前看，在发展两国关系上，多做实事。
    在谈到社会主义问题时，戈尔巴乔夫说，过去我们认为，社会主义只有一种模式，现实证明并不是这么一回事。这几年，我们对这一问题进行了分析。我们是设法根据我们国家的具体条件，将马列主义落实到现实生活中。
    邓小平对此表示赞成。他说，真正的马列主义者必须依据实际情况认识、继承、发展马列主义。不可能存在一种固定的社会主义模式。世界形势，包括科学技术的发展，日新月异，不用新的思想观点来继承、发展马列主义，就不是真正的马列主义。一切墨守成规，只能导致失败。各国只能根据自己的条件来建设社会主义。
    戈尔巴乔夫表示，苏联正以极大的兴趣注视着人民中国发生的事情，并从中学到了有益的东西。
    两位领导人还就柬埔寨问题深入地交换了意见。双方在这一问题上，有一些共同点，但是没有完全取得一致。双方同意由两国外长就此继续交换意见。
    整个会晤是在友好、坦诚的气氛中进行的。会晤持续了两个半小时。会晤后，邓小平设午宴款待戈尔巴乔夫和他的夫人赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃。
    随同戈尔巴乔夫和夫人来访的苏方主要人员参加了会晤，并应邀出席了宴会。
    全国政协主席李先念、国务院副总理姚依林、吴学谦、中共中央书记处书记阎明复、外交部长钱其琛参加了会晤并出席宴会作陪。李先念主席的夫人林佳楣出席了宴会。
