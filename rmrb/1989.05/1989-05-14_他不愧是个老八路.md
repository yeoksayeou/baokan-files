The Construction Bureau of the Lanzhou Military Region Command, led by Director Cao Guangqiao, successfully completed nearly 70,000 square meters of construction. By adopting measures such as subcontracting labor without materials and maximizing the use of old materials, nearly one million yuan was saved compared to the original plan. The cost per square meter of the dormitory buildings was about 20 yuan less than similar buildings. For this, with the approval of the Lanzhou Military Region Party Committee, he was awarded a third-class merit citation. Colleagues who know Cao Guangqiao praised him, saying, "He truly is an old revolutionary!"

Cao Guangqiao enlisted in 1944 and joined the Communist Party in 1945. He participated in dozens of battles, was wounded three times, and received multiple awards for his bravery. In early 1985, he took over as the director of the Construction Bureau and has since been known for his integrity and adherence to regulations.

In early 1986, the Command decided to build four family dormitory buildings. Many construction teams approached Cao Guangqiao seeking to undertake the project. Some teams even offered bribes to secure the contract. However, Cao Guangqiao insisted on selecting the best team, ensuring that the four dormitory buildings were completed on time and to a high standard.

In September 1987, after the main structures of three two-story buildings were completed, the interior decoration work was about to begin. A construction team from Jiangsu learned of this and approached Cao Guangqiao to request the contract. After sending the team leader away, Cao Guangqiao found a red envelope left behind. He immediately chased after them, returned the envelope, and sternly said, "Take your red envelope back. You can't secure a contract with this!" Later, he and the technical team evaluated and compared the samples from several construction teams and signed a contract with the one that offered the highest quality, fastest progress, and lowest cost.

As the leader of the Construction Bureau, Cao Guangqiao never took advantage of his position. In recent years, his family has not used any public materials to make furniture beyond what was originally issued by the military housing department. Cao Guangqiao never takes taxis when traveling on official business and never uses public funds to visit scenic spots. Once, while on a business trip to Shenzhen, he left as soon as his tasks were completed. Someone asked him why he didn't visit the amusement park. He replied, "Staying an extra day means extra expenses. Public funds should be spent wisely, not squandered!"

　　“他不愧是个老八路”
    韩劲　敏杰
    兰州军区司令部营建办公室主任曹广桥，在由他负责完成的近七万平方米建筑面积施工中，对有些工程采用包工不包料和尽量利用旧材料等措施，比原计划节约近百万元，宿舍楼每平方米造价比同样楼房造价低二十元左右。为此，经兰州军区党委批准，给他记三等功一次。熟悉曹广桥的同志称赞说：“他不愧是个老八路！”
    曹广桥１９４４年入伍，１９４５年入党，曾参加过几十次战斗，三次负伤，多次立功受奖。他１９８５年初担任营建办公室主任以后，廉洁奉公，一尘不染，事事按制度办。
    １９８６年初，司令部要修建四幢家属宿舍楼，许多工程队找曹广桥要求承包。为达到目的，有的工程队明确表示要给好处费。曹广桥坚持择优选用，使四幢家属楼保质按期完工。
    １９８７年９月，有三幢二层楼主体工程完工后，内装修工程要开始承包。江苏的一个工程队负责人得知后，找曹广桥要求承包。曹广桥把这位负责人送走后，发现来人留下一个红纸包。他立即追出门，把红包退给他们，并严肃地说：“红包你们拿走，想靠这个来承包工程不行！”后来，他和工程技术人员对几个工程队的装修样品进行审评比较，同一家工艺水平高、进展快、造价低的工程队签订了合同。
    曹广桥身为营建办公室领导，但近水楼台不得月。近年来他家除营房部门原来配发的营具外，没用公家材料为自己做过一件家具。曹广桥出差从不乘出租汽车，不用公款游览名胜古迹。一次，他出差到深圳，事情一办完就离开。有人问他为啥不到游乐场玩玩？他说：“多住一天就多一天开销，公家钱要花在刀刃上，哪能乱花！”
