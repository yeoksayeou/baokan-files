In the Column Hall, Yuri Bondarev was giving a report on Tolstoy. He said, "Everyone has a happy beginning, coming into the world joyfully, but inevitably will end with the tragedy of life's conclusion. From birth to death, from the starting point to the end, how should we spend our time? Why did we come into the world? Who are we? What are we here for? Isn't the meaning of each of our lives precisely to make the world more beautiful, to make our contemporaries and future generations live happier?"

That day was September 22, 1988. The Chinese Writers' Delegation was invited to attend the celebration of the 160th anniversary of Tolstoy's birth. I sat in the first row of the hall. I knew that Lenin had given speeches in this world-famous hall. Gorky had left his footprints here. The voices of many Soviet artists, writers, and scientists whom I admire had echoed here. Several dozen large chandeliers and thousands of imitation candle wall lamps illuminated the three baskets of fresh flowers placed in front of the stage, making them shine brightly. Behind the stage hung a portrait of Tolstoy. His benevolent gaze was fixed on me. At this solemn moment, my feelings were numerous, and I couldn't sort them out.

Bondarev continued his report, but my thoughts wandered. I recalled a passage from his book "Instant": "Compared to the universe's time, a century in human history is merely an instant. However, as long as a person realizes this with shock, he will begin to cherish his days of existence, will ponder the historical contradictions of pain and the meaning of reality..."

Tolstoy is the pride of Russian soil and the glory of all humanity. This master, wasn't he the one who pondered the historical contradictions of pain and the meaning of reality for his entire life?

The evening was presided over by the Chairman of the Soviet Writers' Union, Markov. Attending the grand event were famous Soviet writers, artists, scholars, party and government leaders, and foreign guests.

Gorbachev also attended the evening. At seven o'clock sharp, when the presidium appeared on stage, the audience applauded enthusiastically. Gorbachev smiled and waved to the people in the hall. He wore a black suit with a light blue shirt underneath. His high, bright forehead showed vitality, but his temples were already gray. Then the presidium took their seats. There were nine seats in the front row. Markov sat in the center. On either side of Markov, two seats were occupied by famous Soviet writers. Gorbachev, however, sat in the second-to-last seat on the left side. That day was a meeting convened by the Writers' Union and the Ministry of Culture, with writers as the center and hosts, while the leaders sat to the side. Throughout the meeting, Gorbachev listened intently to each speaker. I didn't see him smoke, nor did I see anyone consult him during the meeting. Since he was only five or six meters away from me, I could see his facial expressions and his eyes clearly. He appeared natural, equal, and approachable, with a democratic demeanor from beginning to end.

Looking at his broad, shiny forehead, I couldn't help but think of his works "Reform and New Thinking" and "The Art of Living in the World." I admire his unique thoughts on the contemporary era. He believes: "The world is a definite whole. We are all passengers on this spaceship called Earth, so we cannot allow this ship to capsize. There won't be a second Noah's Ark." (Reform and New Thinking, page 4) I appreciate his frequent visits to cities and villages, his deep immersion into the lives of ordinary people, and his sincere, patient dialogues with them. He said: "Life vividly proves that at historical turning points, in revolutionary situations, if you tell the truth to the people, the people will show astonishing abilities to listen, understand, and respond." (Reform and New Thinking, page 44)

Gorbachev watched the speaker, but I watched Gorbachev, lost in thought. Not seating by rank, the attendees were used to it and didn't find it surprising, but I, having seen it rarely in Beijing, was left with a strong impression. I thought that such seating has its scientific basis. After all, a leader is not the embodiment of wisdom: someone who is an authority in science, an expert in the arts, and a specialist in education, all at once, does not exist. Ultimately, wisdom lies among the people, among the elites of various fields.

That night, the Chinese Writers' Delegation had to take a night flight to Samarkand, so we left the hall midway through the report and the musical program. We found a Soviet Writers' Union car by Red Square and drove through the bustling streets towards Vnukovo Airport.

Sitting in the car, I looked out the window. The streets of Moscow were filled with two streams of cars, rushing in opposite directions. The countless headlights and taillights made my eyes dizzy. Passing over the iron bridge on the Moskva River, I caught a glimpse of the autumn moon's glow shimmering and dancing on the water. After leaving the city, the birch trees by the roadside came into the light. Moscow became quiet. The driver turned on the car's radio. A familiar song filled the car:

The night is so beautiful, the heart is so joyful,
The evening in the outskirts of Moscow...

　　莫斯科之夜
    张守仁
    圆柱大厅里，尤里·邦达列夫正在做关于托尔斯泰的报告。他说，每一个人都有幸福的开始，快乐地降临世上，但不可避免地将以生命结束的悲剧告终。从生到死、从起点到终点，我们应该怎样度过？我们为什么来到世上？我们是什么人？我们来干什么？我们每一个人活着的意义，难道不正是为了让世界变得更美好，让我们的同代人和后代人生活得更快乐吗？
    那天是１９８８年９月２２日。中国作家代表团应邀出席庆祝托尔斯泰诞辰１６０周年纪念晚会。我坐在大厅的第一排位置上。我知道，列宁曾在这个举世闻名的大厅里作过演说。高尔基曾在这个大厅里留下过足迹。我所敬仰的苏联许多艺术家、作家、科学家的声音都曾在这里回荡。几十只大吊灯、几千支仿烛壁灯，把讲台前侧放着的三篮鲜花，照得熠熠生辉。台后面挂着一幅托尔斯泰的画像。他那慈祥的目光凝视着我。在这庄严的时刻，我的感受很多，一时理不出头绪。
    邦达列夫继续作报告，可我的思想开了小差。我想起他在《瞬间》那本书里的一段话：“与宇宙光阴相比，人间的一世纪只不过是一瞬间。但是，一个人只要震惊地意识到这一点，他就会开始珍惜自己生存的日子，就会为历史上的痛苦矛盾和现实的含义而思索……”
    托尔斯泰是俄罗斯大地的骄傲，也是整个人类的光荣。这位巨匠，不正是为历史上的痛苦矛盾和现实的含义而思索了整整一辈子吗？
    晚会由苏联作协主席马尔柯夫主持。出席盛会的有苏联著名作家、艺术家、学者、党和政府的领导者，还有国外来宾。
    戈尔巴乔夫也出席了晚会。七时整，当主席团出现在台上时，人们热烈鼓掌。戈尔巴乔夫微笑着向大厅里的人招手。他穿一身黑西服，内着淡青色衬衣。额角很高、很亮，显得精力充沛，但两鬓已经斑白。接着主席团就座。前排共九个位置。正中就座的是马尔柯夫。马尔柯夫左右两侧各两个位置上，坐着的都是苏联著名作家。戈尔巴乔夫却坐在左侧倒数第二个位置上。那天是作协和文化部召开的会议，作家是中心，是主人，而领导人则坐在旁边。整个会议期间，戈尔巴乔夫聚精会神地听一个个发言。我没有见他抽烟，也没有见有人开会期间向他请示什么。因他离我仅五、六米的距离，他的面部表情、他的眼神，我看得清清楚楚。他自始至终显得自然、平等、随和，很有民主风度。
    我望着他那宽阔、发亮的额角，不禁想起了他写的《改革与新思维》、《学会生活在世界上的艺术》等著作。我赞赏他对当今时代的独特思考。他认为：“世界是一个确定的整体。我们大家都是地球这一艘船上的乘客，所以不能容许这艘船倾覆。第二艘诺亚方舟是不会有的。”（《改革与新思维》第四页）我欣赏他常到城乡各处，深入普通人民中间，倾听他们的心声，同他们真诚、耐心地对话。他说：“生活鲜明地证实了，在历史急剧转变的关头，在革命形势下，要是向人民说真话，人民就会展示出惊人的倾听、理解和响应的能力。”（《改革与新思维》４４页）
    戈尔巴乔夫注视着报告人，我却注视着戈尔巴乔夫，浮想联翩。不以官位高低来排座次，与会者习以为常，并不惊奇，我却因在北京少见而留下强烈印象。我想到，这样的就座有它的科学性。因为，严格说来，领导者不是智慧的化身：既是科学界的权威，又是文艺界的内行，更是教育界的专家，这样的人不可能存在。说到底，智慧是在人民群众之中，是在各界精英之中。
    那天晚上，中国作家代表团要乘夜航机飞赴撒马尔罕，所以没有听报告会后的音乐节目，中途退场，离开了圆柱大厅。我们在红场边找到了苏联作协的小汽车，穿过车水马龙的繁华街道，驶向伏努科伏机场。
    我坐在小车里向外张望，莫斯科的街道上，逆向和顺向两股车流，风驰电掣般地涌动。流泻着的无数前灯和尾灯，令人眼花缭乱。路经莫斯科河上的铁桥，瞥见秋月的光辉在河面上闪烁、跳跃。离开闹市之后，路边一座座白桦林扑进灯光里来。莫斯科变得幽静了。司机打开了车上的收录机。一支熟悉的歌曲在车内荡漾：
    夜色多么好，心儿多欢畅，
    莫斯科郊外的晚上……
