Forest, hailed as "green gold," has the functions and benefits of conserving water and soil, preventing wind and fixing sand, regulating climate, and improving the ecological environment. However, this precious natural resource is facing misfortune. Records show that in the early days of human history, two-thirds of the Earth was covered by forests, with a forest area of about 7.6 billion hectares. It can be said that humans lived in a green world. Later, with the increase in population and the development of industry, coupled with wars and natural disasters, forests have been severely damaged, especially the rapid reduction of virgin forest area. Currently, the world's forest area is less than one-third of the land area.

		11.5 million hectares lost annually
According to a survey by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the world's forests are disappearing at a rate of 11.5 million hectares per year. This is equivalent to the total area of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland combined. Since the end of World War II, the area of tropical forests on Earth has decreased by nearly half, putting millions of species of animals and plants in danger of extinction. Tropical rainforests cover 6% of the Earth's surface and play a role in regulating the global climate. However, humans are trampling this resource treasure. In the past 30 years, 40% of the tropical rainforests have been destroyed, with an average of 100 acres being cut down every minute. In Central America, more than 8,000 square miles of tropical rainforests are cleared each year to create pastures for cattle to be exported to the United States. The tropical rainforests along the Atlantic coast of Brazil have been reduced to less than 2%. In the Amazon basin, at least 400 square miles of forests are cut down each year.

		Africa and Asia most severely affected
In Africa, half of the forests have been cut down, and now nearly 900,000 hectares of tropical forests disappear from the Earth each year. Nigeria's tropical rainforest coverage has been reduced by more than 90%; Ghana's by 80%; Ethiopia's forest coverage was once 75% of its territory, but by 1981, it had dropped to just 3.1%.

In Asia, in recent years, 8 million hectares of forests have been cut down each year. In the Philippines, 54% of the land was covered by forests in 1969, but by 1988, this had dropped to less than 21%, with more than 180,000 hectares of tropical forests being destroyed each year. Indonesia has more than 10% of the world's tropical forests, second only to Brazil, but now it loses 2.4 million acres of forests each year. Just one forest fire in 1982 destroyed 8 million acres of forests. In Thailand, in the past 10 years, 25% of the country's tropical rainforests have been destroyed, and by the end of this century, the country's tropical rainforests may completely disappear. In India, in the past 30 years, the forest area has been reduced by 40%, causing the Ganges River basin to experience severe floods during the rainy season. In Vietnam, in the past 40 years, half of the forests have been cut down. From 1943 to 1983, over 40 years, the forest area decreased by 45%.

		Consequences of deforestation are evident
The destruction of forests poses a serious threat to humans. Firstly, it causes global climate anomalies, leading to the "greenhouse effect" and an increase in the Earth's average temperature. Scientists predict that if deforestation continues at the current rate, by 2010, temperatures will rise by 1.5°C to 4.5°C, resulting in the melting of polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and the submergence of many coastal cities.

Secondly, deforestation exacerbates floods and droughts. Bangladesh's large-scale logging, overgrazing, and agricultural production have eroded the water and soil of the southern slopes of the Himalayas, making the monsoon season increasingly disastrous. In 1988, the Ganges River flooded, causing a disaster that left 30 million people homeless and two-thirds of the land submerged. Due to the increasing population in Africa's arid regions, people are forced to clear forests for farming, leading to floods after droughts. In the summer of the previous year, Sudan experienced floods that left more than 1.5 million people homeless. During the same period, heavy rains in the southern and southwestern parts of Niger caused 14 counties to be affected, leaving more than 300,000 people displaced. In addition, the disappearance of forests may turn into deserts in a few years. Currently, the Sahara Desert is expanding towards Northwest Africa at a rate of 3.5 miles per year.

Thirdly, deforestation threatens the survival of 80% of the world's plants and nearly 4 million species of animals. Forests, especially tropical forests, preserve a large number of biological species. The Amazon basin alone is estimated to have 1 million species of animals and plants, including at least 30,000 species of plants, 2,500 species of birds, and 2,000 species of fish. Due to the cutting of tropical forests, the Earth's species are disappearing at a rate of at least one species per day, and by 1990, this rate will increase to one species per hour. In 15 years, one-quarter of the Earth's species may be extinct.

The severity of the global deforestation problem has drawn the attention of various countries to forest protection and afforestation activities. The United Nations Development Programme has called for global mobilization to take measures to protect forest resources; otherwise, humans will pay a heavy price.

    毁林严重  人类遭灾
    赵新华
    被誉为“绿色金子”的森林，有保持水土、防风固沙、调节气候、改善生态环境的功能和效益。然而，森林这一宝贵的自然资源，却面临着厄运。据记载，在人类历史初期，地球上２／３为森林覆盖，森林面积约有７６亿公顷，可以说人类是生活在绿色世界之中，后来随着人口增加、工业的发展，再加上战争和自然灾害等原因，森林遭到严重的破坏，尤其是原始森林面积迅速减少，目前世界森林面积已不到陆地面积的１／３。
    　　　　每年消失１１５０万公顷
    据联合国粮农组织调查，世界森林正以每年１１５０万公顷的速度消失，这相当于比利时、荷兰和瑞士国土面积的总和。自第二次世界大战以来，地球上热带森林面积已减少近半，致使百万种动物和植物濒临灭种的危险。热带雨林覆盖地球表面６％，起着调节全球气候的作用，可是人类正在践踏这个资源宝库。在过去３０年中，４０％的热带雨林已被毁灭，平均每分钟砍伐１００英亩。在中美洲，每年有８０００多平方英里的热带雨林被夷为牧场，以饲养肉牛向美国出口。巴西大西洋沿岸的热带雨林只剩不足２％。亚马孙河流域的大片森林，每年至少有４００平方英里被砍伐掉。
    　　　　非洲和亚洲最严重
    在非洲，森林已被砍伐了一半，现在每年有近９０万公顷的热带森林从地球上消失。尼日利亚的热带雨林覆盖面积已减少９０％以上；加纳减少８０％；埃塞俄比亚从前有３／４的国土为森林所覆盖，到１９８１年森林覆盖率仅有３．１％。
    在亚洲，近年来每年有８００万公顷森林被砍伐掉。菲律宾１９６９年国土面积的５４％覆盖着森林，１９８８年已降到不足２１％，每年有１８万公顷以上的热带林被毁。印度尼西亚拥有世界热带林的１０％以上，仅次于巴西，现在每年损失森林２４０万英亩，仅１９８２年发生的一场森林大火就损失了８００万英亩的森林。在泰国，过去１０年间，全国的热带雨林已被毁掉２５％，到本世纪末，该国的热带雨林可能完全消失。在印度，过去３０年中森林面积减少４０％，致使恒河流域雨季洪水暴涨。越南在过去４０年里，森林已被砍伐一半。从１９４３年至１９８３年４０年间森林面积减少了４５％。
    　　　　毁林恶果引人注目
    森林的毁坏对人类构成严重的威胁。首先使全球性气候反常，出现“温室效应”，地球上的平均温度提高。科学家预测，如果非森林化以现在的速度继续下去，那么到２０１０年，气温将上升１．５℃—４．５℃，其结果是极地冰帽溶化，海平面提高，致使沿海许多城市淹没。
    其次，森林砍伐加剧水旱灾害。孟加拉国大量砍伐林木，过度的放牧和农业生产侵蚀着喜马拉雅山南坡的水土，使得孟加拉国的季风雨季变得越来越具有灾害性。１９８８年恒河水位猛涨，造成洪灾，有３０００万人失去家园，２／３的土地受淹。由于非洲干旱地区人口日益增多，被迫开荒毁林种地，导致在旱灾之后又发生水灾，苏丹在去年夏季发生的水灾使１５０多万人无家可归。在同一时期，尼日尔南部和西南部连降大雨，全国有１４个县受灾，造成３０多万人流离失所。此外，森林的消失数年后就可能变成为沙漠。目前，撒哈拉大沙漠以每年３．５英里的速度向西北非扩展。
    再次，毁林威胁着地球上８０％的植物和近４００万种生物的生存。森林，特别是热带森林保存着大量生物物种，仅亚马孙河流域估计有１００万种动植物，其中植物至少有３万种包括２５００种乔木、１８００种鸟类，２０００种鱼类。由于热带森林的砍伐，使地球上的物种以至少每日减少一种的速度趋向灭绝，到１９９０年速度将提高到每小时减少一种，１５年内，地球上的生物种可能被灭绝１／４。
    世界毁林问题的严重性已引起各国对森林保护和造林活动的重视。联合国开发计划署呼吁：必须全球动员，采取措施，保护森林资源，否则，人类将会付出重大的代价。
