    Acupuncture therapy for male urological diseases shows good results
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th - (Correspondent Li Hong) The Beijing Military Region Medical Association Fengtai Expert Clinic, Dr. Ma Guobin, after many years of dedicated research and long-term clinical practice, has used traditional acupuncture therapy to treat male urological diseases, achieving remarkable results.

    Male urological diseases include impotence, premature ejaculation, and infertility, among others. Clinical symptoms include neurasthenia, dizziness, mental fatigue, memory loss, dry eyes, weak knees, damp scrotum, and cold legs.

    Based on the stone-needle therapy from the "Huangdi Neijing," Ma Guobin has developed a treatment method that integrates traditional Chinese and Western medical theories. By stimulating specific acupuncture points, the method helps restore the balance of yin and yang and the circulation of qi and blood, thereby restoring normal function. This therapy is safe and convenient, and does not require hospitalization. Each treatment session takes about 30 minutes, with a course of treatment consisting of 5 sessions. Generally, the condition can be cured within one course of treatment. Many patients see significant improvement after just one or two treatments.

　　针挑疗法治男科疾病效果好
    据新华社北京５月２５日电  （通讯员李鸿）北京军区医协会丰台专家门诊部马国宾大夫，经过多年的潜心研究和长期的临床实践，运用传统的针挑疗法医治男科疾病，取得显著效果。
    男科疾病包括阳痿、早泄、不育症等，临床症状为神经衰弱，头昏脑胀，精神萎靡，记忆减退，眼睛干涩，腰膝酸软，阴囊潮湿，下肢寒凉等。
    马国宾根据《黄帝内经》中的砭石疗法，运用发展民间流传的针挑疗法，独创了融汇中西医理的治疗方法，在特定的穴位上进行针挑刺激，以使人体失调的阴阳、气血重新得到平衡，从而恢复正常功能。这种疗法的特点是安全简便，不需住院。每次治疗大约用３０分钟左右，５次为一个疗程，一般的在一个疗程内即可治愈，很多病人治疗一两次，病情就明显好转。
