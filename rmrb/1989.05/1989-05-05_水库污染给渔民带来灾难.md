The Huangjiawo Village in Chashopian Town, Yun County, Hubei Province, is located in the upper-middle reaches of the Danjiangkou Reservoir. In recent years, the villagers have been raising fish in net cages within the reservoir. In 1987 alone, they invested 180,000 yuan and released 1.15 million fish fry.

On the evening of October 19, 1988, the fish in the net cages became restless, stirring the water surface with a splashing sound. Subsequently, many fish floated to the surface with their bellies up. Within just two days, 267,000 fish died, affecting 45 households, resulting in a direct economic loss of 135,000 yuan. The village party branch secretary, Xu Shengyou, lost all 22 cages of fish, amounting to a loss of 16,000 yuan. Villager Jiang Mingquan also lost all 56,000 fish, incurring an economic loss of 16,500 yuan.

On November 14, the county's Fisheries Bureau and Environmental Protection Bureau, along with other departments, conducted a joint investigation and determined that the cause was the discharge of untreated industrial wastewater from an upstream fertilizer plant. The county's environmental protection department, based on relevant regulations, demanded that the factory compensate the fishermen for their losses totaling 57,915 yuan. However, this decision has not been implemented.

　　水库污染给渔民带来灾难
    湖北郧县茶店镇黄家窝村位于丹江水库中上游。近几年，村里群众在水库内养殖网箱鱼。仅１９８７年，他们投资１８万元，投放鱼苗１１５万尾。
    １９８８年１０月１９日晚，网箱里的鱼烦燥不安，搅得河面哗哗啦啦，接着许多鱼翻着白肚子漂浮在河面上。短短的两天时间，死鱼２６．７万条，殃及４５户人家，直接经济损失１３．５万元。村党支部书记许生有的２２箱鱼全部死亡，损失１．６万元。村民江明全的５．６万条鱼也全部死亡，经济损失１．６５万元。
    １１月１４日，县水产局、环保局等部门联合调查，认定是上游一家化肥厂大量排放未经处理的工业废水所致。县环保部门根据有关规定，要求厂方赔偿渔民损失５７９１５元，但这个处理意见迟迟不能落实。
