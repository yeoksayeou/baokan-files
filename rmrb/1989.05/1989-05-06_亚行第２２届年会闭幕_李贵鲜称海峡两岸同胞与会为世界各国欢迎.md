The 22nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank concluded today at the Great Wall Hotel after three days of heated discussions and the adoption of a series of resolutions.

The meeting elected the Indian governor as the chairman of the next board, and the governors of Spain and Malaysia as vice-chairmen, for terms starting from the end of this meeting until the conclusion of the 23rd annual meeting.

The meeting decided that the 23rd annual meeting will be held in New Delhi from May 2-4, 1990, and the 24th annual meeting will be held in Vancouver from April 24-26, 1991.

The Indian governor, in his speech, expressed gratitude for being elected as the chairman for the next year and pledged to maintain high-level management. He welcomed the representatives to attend the meeting in India.

In his closing remarks, President Fujioka pointed out that over the past three days, the governors reviewed the economic development of various countries and the entire region, evaluated the role of the ADB in 1988, and made constructive suggestions for the future activities and role of the ADB. He said that the governors were satisfied with the achievements of the ADB in economic activities and hoped for more systematic cooperation and mutual support in the future. The governors supported the increase in lending and emphasized the importance of reducing poverty, which is one of the important goals of the ADB in the future. He welcomed the expert group's suggestions for future activities and praised the success of the 22nd annual meeting, expressing heartfelt thanks to the People's Republic of China for its warm hospitality.

Chairman Li Guixian of this session said in his speech that this session had conducted fruitful discussions on a series of broad-ranging issues, which would help the ADB governors make wiser and more constructive decisions in the future, thereby making a more active contribution to the economic cooperation and development of the Asia-Pacific region. He thanked the enthusiastic, friendly, generous, and magnanimous host country government and people, and the host country leaders. He expressed that the seeds of understanding, friendship, and cooperation sown here today will bear abundant fruits in the future, and then declared the meeting closed.

In another report, Vice Premier and Governor of the People's Bank of China Li Guixian said at a press conference today that the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank was held in Beijing, and the compatriots across the Taiwan Strait had the opportunity to meet here, which was not only welcomed by all descendants of the Yellow Emperor but also welcomed by the public of all countries in the world.

Li Guixian, in response to a question about what legal guarantees the mainland provides for Taiwanese residents who come to settle here, said that the Chinese government is formulating relevant regulations to make specific provisions for this.

Li Guixian, when asked to comment on Guo Wanrong's protest yesterday afternoon regarding the renaming of Taiwan to "Chinese Taipei" to the ADB authorities, said, "The ADB authorities and the conference executive chairman have already corrected this on the spot. 'I have no new views.' 'It is understood that after Guo Wanrong's speech, the conference executive chairman immediately pointed out that the name of Taiwan in the ADB records should be 'Chinese Taipei.'"
