    Elopement  He Fucheng
    Originally published in "Satire and Humor"

    The young man and woman, both in their twenties, were deeply in love. However, their families were opposed to their relationship, and the young man's family even went so far as to threaten to cut off their financial support if he insisted on marrying the young woman. The young woman's family was also against the marriage, fearing that it would bring shame to their family name.

    Despite the opposition, the young couple decided to elope. They planned their escape carefully, choosing a time when both families would be least likely to notice their absence. They packed a few belongings and set off in the middle of the night, heading for a distant city where they hoped to start a new life together.

    Their journey was fraught with danger. They had to avoid detection by the authorities, who were alerted to their elopement by the families. They traveled by night, hiding during the day, and subsisting on whatever food they could find. After several days of hardship, they finally reached their destination.

    In the new city, they found work and a place to live. They struggled at first, but their love for each other gave them the strength to persevere. They worked hard, saved money, and eventually built a stable life for themselves.

    Their families, meanwhile, were shocked and angry at their elopement. They tried to find them, but to no avail. Over time, they came to accept the reality of their children's marriage and eventually reconciled with them.

    The young couple's story is a testament to the power of love and the lengths people will go to for the ones they care about. It is also a reminder that sometimes, the path to happiness is not an easy one, but with determination and perseverance, it can be achieved.
