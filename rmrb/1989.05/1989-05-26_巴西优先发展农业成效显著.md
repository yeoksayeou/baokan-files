While many countries around the world are facing the threat of food shortages, Brazil's grain production has achieved remarkable development. Since the 1980s, successive Brazilian governments have placed the development of agriculture, particularly the increase of grain production, at the forefront of economic development. By utilizing economic measures, implementing reasonable pricing policies, and actively promoting practical agricultural technologies, grain production has steadily increased, transforming Brazil from a grain-deficient country into a grain exporter. Last year, the export earnings from soybeans and their by-products alone reached $3 billion.

Changing the Monoculture Economy

Historically, Brazil was a country with a single economic focus on coffee production. At one point, coffee production accounted for 70% of the world's total output, and export value accounted for more than 95% of the country's total exports, while domestic food supply was largely dependent on imports. After World War II, with the overall economic takeoff, agricultural production began to transition towards diversification.

In 1950, Brazil's total grain production was less than 14 million tons, with per capita production at 269 kilograms. By 1975, this had increased to over 40 million tons, with per capita production reaching 419 kilograms. In the past three years, Brazil's agriculture has seen consecutive bumper harvests, with grain production increasing from 54 million tons to 66 million tons. According to the Brazilian Ministry of Agriculture's third estimate of grain production for the 1988-1989 agricultural year, it is expected to exceed 70 million tons. With Brazil's current population of 140 million, the per capita grain availability has reached 500 kilograms. While this figure is not high compared to developed countries, it is sufficient to meet domestic market demand and allows for some grain to be exported. In 1988, the export value of agricultural and pastoral products reached $13 billion, accounting for 38.6% of the total annual exports.

"Filling People's Bowls"

Like other Latin American countries, Brazil, in pursuing an industrialization-first development policy, had previously neglected agriculture, leading to grain production falling short of demand. This resulted in soaring food prices, exacerbating inflationary pressures, and having a detrimental impact on economic development and social stability.

Through this experience, the Brazilian government realized that to achieve economic and social stability, the first step is to "fill people's bowls." Therefore, during the military government period in 1979, the policy of "prioritizing agricultural development" was proposed, giving "special attention" to grain production.

In recent years, despite Brazil facing severe financial and economic difficulties, with a heavy external debt burden, and many large-scale engineering projects being forced to halt or slow down, the government has still allocated as much funding as possible to agriculture. In 1988, the government's agricultural investment reached 340 billion cruzados, accounting for approximately 16% of the country's total annual income, and this year it plans to increase this proportion to 25%.

Brazil's agricultural investment funds come mainly from four sources: government allocations, private bank investments, social fundraising, and attracting foreign investment. To attract more domestic and foreign funds into agriculture, the Brazilian government established the Agricultural and Pastoral Development Foundation in 1987 and opened a special agricultural savings deposit service. In recent years, it has signed agricultural cooperation agreements with countries such as Spain, the Soviet Union, Hungary, and Japan, and signed loan agreements with international financial institutions such as the World Bank to introduce foreign capital and advanced technology to develop agricultural irrigation and rural electrification.

Focusing on Developing Backward Regions

In addition to supporting agriculture through loans, the Brazilian government has established various specialized institutions and regional bodies responsible for developing agricultural and pastoral production, such as the Irrigation Department, the Land Reform Department (now merged into the Ministry of Agriculture), the Northeast Development Agency, the Central-West Development Agency, and the Amazon Development Agency. Through these institutions, comprehensive regional development plans are formulated and implemented, funds are raised, personnel are trained, infrastructure is built, migrants are settled, and public and private sectors are encouraged to invest in government-designated key development regions and projects. This approach has yielded significant results.

The reporter, upon the invitation of the Brazilian Irrigation Department, visited a newly developed agricultural irrigation area in the Northeast. This area was once the country's poorest drought-stricken region, previously sparsely vegetated and sparsely populated. Now, over 300 large and medium-sized reservoirs and more than 70 irrigation areas have been built, with an irrigation area of 200,000 hectares. In the barren land, oases have emerged, becoming the Northeast's grain, vegetable, and fruit base.

Using Economic Measures to Boost Farmers' Production Enthusiasm

Brazil has long implemented a "minimum guaranteed price" system for agricultural products, which is the government's main economic measure to encourage farmers to cultivate and increase grain production. Every year, between two harvest seasons, the government, based on the domestic and international market demand and price fluctuations for various agricultural products, publishes the minimum price for agricultural products for the next harvest season. The price for the same product varies by region according to different levels of economic development, and is adjusted monthly according to the average price index. Producers have the right to sell their products at a price higher than the minimum level in the market. When there is an oversupply of products and market prices fall, producers can sell their products to the government at the minimum price, with the government "buying in." When market supply is short and prices rise, the government can "sell out." The government has also established a production assistance committee as the official body to execute the minimum guaranteed price for agricultural products.

Promoting Scientific and Technological Achievements in Production

In developing agricultural production, Brazil places great importance on the role of science and technology, with agricultural research institutions particularly emphasizing the provision of practical technologies to farmers, ensuring that scientific and technological achievements are quickly applied to production. For example, in the development of civilian nuclear technology, the nuclear energy research department has applied it to improving land utilization rates and cultivating rice, beans, wheat, soybeans, and citrus varieties with strong disease resistance and adaptability. In the development of civilian information technology, agricultural computer planning is actively promoted, providing various consulting services to farmers.

The most important agricultural research institution in Brazil is the National Agricultural and Pastoral Research Company. This company has 44 research centers distributed throughout the country. Over the past decade, the research centers have promoted more than 600 practical new technologies, playing an important role in promoting Brazil's agricultural and pastoral development. The most outstanding achievement is the research and promotion of soybean cultivation in tropical regions.

In 1970, Brazil's soybean production was only 1.5 million tons, but last year it reached nearly 18 million tons. Brazil, which has only been cultivating soybeans for more than 20 years, has now become the world's second-largest soybean producer and exporter.

　　巴西优先发展农业成效显著
    本报记者  兰才基
    正当世界许多国家受到粮荒威胁的时候，巴西粮食生产却取得了引人注目的发展。８０年代以来，巴西各届政府都把发展农业，尤其是增加粮食生产置于发展经济的优先地位，运用经济手段、执行合理的价格政策并积极推行农业实用科技，使粮食生产稳步增长，从一个缺粮国变成了粮食出口国。去年，光是大豆及制成品的出口创汇额就达到３０亿美元。
  改变单一农业经济
    在历史上，巴西曾经是一个生产咖啡的单一经济国家，咖啡产量一度占世界总产量的７０％，出口值占全国出口总值的９５％以上，而国内的粮食供应绝大部分依赖进口。二次大战后，随着整个经济的起飞，农业生产开始向多样化过渡。
    １９５０年巴西粮食总产量还不足１４００万吨，人均仅达２６９公斤，１９７５年突破４０００万吨，人均达到４１９公斤。最近３年，巴西农业连获丰收，粮产从５４００万吨上升到６６００万吨。根据巴西农业部最近对１９８８—１９８９农业年度粮食产量所作的第３次估产，预计可超过７０００万吨。按巴西现有１．４亿人口计算，人均粮食占有量已达５００公斤。这个基数，与发达国家相比并不算高，但已能满足国内市场的需求，并有一部分粮食可供出口。１９８８年，农牧业产品出口值达１３０亿美元，占全年出口总额的３８．６％。
  “填满人们的饭碗”
    巴西和其它拉美国家一样，在推行以工业化为先导的发展方针中，曾经对农业有所忽视，粮食产量赶不上需要，导致各种食品价格猛涨，加剧了通货膨胀压力，对经济发展和社会安定都带来了十分不利的影响。
    通过这段弯路，巴西政府觉察到，要使经济稳定和社会安定，首先要“填满人们的饭碗”。因此，在１９７９年军政府时期就提出了“优先发展农业”的方针，对粮食生产给予“特别的注重”。
    近些年内，尽管巴西财政经济遇到严重困难，外债负担很重，许多大型工程项目被迫停建缓建，但政府仍然抽拨尽可能多的资金投入农业。１９８８年政府提供的农业投资达３．４万亿克鲁扎多，约占全年国内总收入的１６％，今年又将这个比例提高到２５％。
    巴西农业投资资金主要来自４个方面：政府拨款、私人银行投资、社会集资和吸收外资。为了吸收更多的国内外资金投入农业，巴西政府在１９８７年成立了农牧业发展基金会，并开办了农业储蓄存款专项业务。近几年先后同西班牙、苏联、匈牙利、日本等国签署了农业合作协定，同世界银行等国际金融机构签订了贷款协定，引进外资和先进技术发展农业水利灌溉和农村电力事业。
  重点开发落后地区
    巴西政府除了以贷款方式支持农业外，还建立了各种负责发展农牧业生产的专门机构和地区性的机构，如灌溉部、土改部（现已并入农业部）、东北部开发署、中西部地区开发署和亚马孙开发署等。通过这些机构，一方面制订和推行地区开发综合规划，一方面筹集资金、培训人才、搞基础设施建设、安置移民、促进公共部门和私人向政府确定的重点开发地区和项目投资。这样做，取得了明显的成效。
    记者曾经应巴西灌溉部的邀请，到东北部新开发的农业灌溉区参观，这里曾是全国最贫困的干旱地区，以前草木疏落，人烟稀少。现在已建成了３００多个大中型水库和７０多个灌溉区，灌溉面积达２０万公顷，在荒芜的土地上出现了片片绿洲，成为东北部粮食、蔬菜和水果基地。
  用经济手段提高农民生产积极性
    巴西一直实行农产品“最低保证价格”制度，这是政府鼓励农民种田和增加粮食生产的主要经济手段。每年两个收获季节之间，政府依据国内外市场对各项农产品的需求和价格涨落，公布下一收获季节的农产品最低价格，同一产品价格根据各地区不同的经济发展水平分为若干档次，并按照物价平均指数每月作出调整。生产者有权在市场上以高于最低水平的价格出售自己的产品。当产品过剩、市价下落时，生产者可按最低价格把产品售给政府，由政府“吞进”，在市场供应短缺、价格升涨时再“吐出”来。政府还设置了资助生产委员会作为执行农产品最低保证价格的官方机构。
  把科技成果迅速用于生产
    在发展农业生产中，巴西很重视科学技术的作用，农业科研部门特别注重向农民提供实用技术，使科技成果迅速用于生产。例如在发展民用核技术方面，核能研究部门已经把它应用于提高土地利用率，培育具有抗病性能和适应性强的水稻、杂豆、小麦、大豆和柑桔新品种。在发展民用信息业方面，积极推广农业电脑规划，向农民提供各种咨询服务。
    巴西全国最重要的农业科研机构是国家农牧业研究公司，这家公司设有４４个研究中心，分布在全国各地。过去１０余年间，研究中心推广了６００多项实用新技术，对推动巴西农牧业发展起了重要作用。其中最突出的成果是研究和推广在热带地区种植大豆。
    １９７０年巴西大豆产量只有１５０万吨，去年已达到近１８００万吨。种植大豆只有２０多年历史的巴西，现在已跃居为世界名列第二的大豆生产国和出口国。
