    Nurturing with Care
    Since its establishment in 1984, the Nan Shan Road Kindergarten in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, has nurtured over 2,400 students. Among them, many have become engineers, scientists, teachers, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Currently, 9 teachers in the kindergarten are dedicated to nurturing the next generation. In their early childhood education work, they have organized various meaningful activities, integrating education with fun, continuously developing the children's intelligence, and promoting their all-round development in terms of morality, intelligence, physical health, and aesthetics.
