The original meaning of the word "抓" is to take something with one's hand (or claw), and it can also be extended to mean capturing. I don't know when it started, but the meaning of "抓" has greatly expanded and become more flexible. There are phrases like "抓革命" (grasp the revolution), "抓生产" (grasp production), "抓思想" (grasp ideology)... It's like seeing the claws of a dragon but not the body, everywhere there is "抓." Thus, many performing arts units and layers of cultural administrative departments have also seen officials who "抓" scriptwriting. Over time, everyone has become accustomed to it, thinking that scriptwriting naturally relies on leaders to "抓"!

No! Scripts are not "grasped" by any leader; they are "written" by playwrights. Look at the masterpieces in the history of drama: who "grasped" Tang Xianzu's "The Peony Pavilion" or Kong Shangren's "The Peach Blossom Fan"? Who "grasped" Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm" or Lao She's "Teahouse"? The logic is actually simple: scriptwriting is the individual and creative labor of playwrights. Not long ago, there was a time when there was a frenzy of "grasping": under the guidance of the so-called "three-in-one" model of "leadership provides ideas, the masses provide life, and writers provide skills," some "fresh" products were "grasped" to meet the demand; but the record of failure is not the revenge of artistic laws? Perhaps the remnants of this practice still exist, such as insisting that scriptwriters must follow the leader's intentions, or even having officials who can write scripts themselves. The result, of course, is "looking west to Chang'an"!

So, should leaders with specialized duties do nothing? Of course not. Some leaders might modestly say, "I did not overstep my authority, nor did I do nothing; I just expressed my opinions as an ordinary audience, you can listen or not listen." We believe that leaders are humble and respectful of talents; however, if they truly detach themselves, things might be even worse. Since they have specialized duties, they inevitably have specialized power, and they should not be confused with ordinary people. The production (synthesis) of drama is much more complex than literature, involving many more links, including manpower, financial resources, and future publicity and criticism, which probably cannot do without these leaders (we cannot deny the reality of "official position" in real life). The active attitude of leaders seems to be to do some practical work for the production of plays. What to do? Or what to "grasp"? I think the main points are two:

First, improve their own appreciation abilities. Leaders should at least reach the level of a qualified critic to gain the right to speak about works, to be able to make judgments such as "whether there is a foundation" or "whether there is a hint" when facing the drafts of scripts on their desks, and not to be confused by red cinnabar and yellow soil. At the same time, leaders should have a deep understanding of the qualities of their subordinate scriptwriters. Whether an "immature" script has bright spots, and whether a script with "hints" can "rise to a higher level," all require leaders to have a correct estimate of the abilities and potential of scriptwriters. In truth, "making decisions" is not easy.

Second, provide conveniences for creation. Generally speaking, scriptwriters will not reject modification opinions and will eagerly hope for support from all sides. The responsibility of leaders is to turn the good wishes for fostering creation into actual actions to solve difficulties, and the most important thing is to be good at using their power to put the scripts on their desks into stage practice. Here, it includes the material conditions necessary for creation and rehearsal, as well as eliminating interference, publicity, and encouragement, etc.

If leaders who "grasp" creation can do the first point well, scriptwriters will be pleased; if the second point is also done well, scriptwriters will be grateful—for their labor being respected and their value being recognized.

Then, "grasp" it!

　　“抓”的析义
    郭启宏
    “抓”的本义是用手（或爪）取物，也引伸为捉拿。不知从什么时候开始，“抓”的含意大大拓展了，搞活了，什么“抓”革命，“抓”生产，“抓”思想……神龙见爪不见身，无处不“抓”。于是，众多的表演艺术单位，层层叠叠的文化主管部门，也出现了“抓”剧本创作的长官。久而久之，大家习以为常，觉得剧本创作本来就靠领导来“抓”嘛！
    否！剧本不是哪位领导“抓”出来，而是剧作家“写”出来的。看一看戏剧史上的杰作，谁“抓”过汤显祖的《牡丹亭》、孔尚任的《桃花扇》？曹禺的《雷雨》、老舍的《茶馆》又是谁“抓”的？道理其实简单：剧本创作是剧作家个体的、创造性的劳动。不远的历史记载着，有过那样一段时间，出现过那样一股“抓”的狂热：在所谓“领导出思想，群众出生活，作家出技巧”的“三结合”模式指导下，“抓”出了一些应节上市的“鲜货”；然而，断烂惨败的记录不正是艺术规律的报复吗？！也许，遗风犹在，诸如定要剧作者服从领导意图，婆婆铁嘴钢牙小媳妇不敢犯葛之类，甚至还有粗通文墨的长官定要捉刀代笔之类，后果当然是“西望长安”！
    那么，负有专门职司的领导就袖手不管了吗？当然不是。一些领导者或许会谦恭地说：“我没有擅权，也没有袖手，我只是作为一个普通观众来发表意见，你们可听可不听。”我们相信领导者虚怀若谷，礼贤下士吧；然而，倘真超脱，事情同样糟糕，也许更糟。既负有专门职司，毕竟拥有专门权力，不必混同于小老百姓；戏剧的生产（合成）更不同于文学，环节复杂得多，人力、财力以及日后的宣传、评论，大概都离不开这些领导（我们不可能闭着眼睛否认现实生活中的“官本位”）。领导者积极的态度似乎应该是为剧目的编演做些实事。做些什么？也可以说“抓”些什么？我以为主要抓两点：
    一是提高自身的鉴赏能力。领导者至少要达到一个称职的评论家的水平，才能获得对作品的发言资格，才能面对办公桌上的剧本初稿作出“有没有基础”、“有没有苗头”之类的判断，才不至于老眼昏花、睡眼惺忪、醉眼朦胧，而不辨朱砂黄土。与此同时，领导者要对属下的剧作者的素质有深切的了解，“不成熟”的剧本有没有闪光的亮点，“有苗头”的剧本能否“更上一层楼”，都需要领导者对剧作者的才能和潜力有着正确的估计。说真格的，“拍板”亦非易事。
    二是提供创作上的方便。一般说来，剧作者不会拒绝修改意见，更热望得到各方的支持。领导者的责任在于把扶植创作的良好愿望变为解决困难的实际行动，最重要的是善于运用手中的权力，把案上的剧本付诸舞台实践。这里，包括创作和排演所必需的物质条件，也包括排除干扰、宣传鼓动等等精神支援。
    “抓”创作的领导倘能做好第一点，剧作者将心悦诚服；倘若第二点也做好了，剧作者将感激涕零——为劳动受到尊重、价值得到承认。
    那就“抓”吧！
