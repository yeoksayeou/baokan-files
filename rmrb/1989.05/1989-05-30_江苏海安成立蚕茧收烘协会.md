Hai'an County in Jiangsu Province has established the Silk Cocoon Drying Association, the first of its kind in the province.

The inaugural meeting of the association's board of directors discussed measures to prevent the "silk cocoon wars." First, they emphasized the need for collective effort to form a united front. Internally, they will coordinate with relevant units, and externally, they will connect with three cities and five counties in Nantong, Yangzhou, and Yancity, sharing information, maintaining a unified stance, and mutually supervising each other. Second, they will strengthen technical guidance. They require cocoon graders to strictly control the inspection process. They insist on using instrument-based pricing as the primary method, with manual and visual estimates frequently verified by instruments. They will not sell "raw cocoons" prematurely.

    江苏海安成立
    蚕茧收烘协会
    本报讯  五月二十五日，海安县成立了蚕茧收烘协会，这在江苏是第一家。
    首届理事会研究了制止蚕茧大战的措施：首先通力协作形成群体力量，对内协调各有关单位，对外联系南通、扬州、盐城三市五县，互通情报，统一口径，相互监督。其次，加强技术指导。要求评茧员切实把好检测关。坚持以仪器检验结价为主，手估目测要经常以仪器核对。决不提前出售“毛脚茧”。（杨一秋）
