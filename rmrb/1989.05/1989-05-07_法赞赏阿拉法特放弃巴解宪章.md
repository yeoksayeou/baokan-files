France praises Arafat's abandonment of the PLO Charter

    The French presidential spokesperson, Vedrine, stated today in Paris that the announcement by the PLO leader Arafat that the 1964 PLO Charter is outdated is "an important step in the right direction."

    Vedrine believes that this stance by the PLO opens up a new phase in the Middle East peace process, which will help promote new progress in other areas. He also said that Arafat's attitude shows his desire for early realization of Middle East peace.
