From the column: Heart to Heart

This year, my New Year's goods were not only abundant but also excessive. These goods were all sent by my unit before the New Year. They included: 4 chickens, 4 ducks, 2 pork legs (I kept 1 weighing 14 kilograms), 7 kilograms of fish, 1.5 kilograms each of chicken legs and wings, 5 kilograms of soybean oil, 2.5 kilograms of eggs, 2.5 kilograms of peanuts, 2 bottles of fragrant oil, 2 bottles of Yanghe Daqu, 5 kilograms of apples, and 200 grams of wood ear mushrooms. The gifts for retired cadres are not included. I estimated that if I were to buy these goods at market prices, it would cost over 300 yuan, but I only paid over 100 yuan.

Our unit is a provincial company with very poor economic performance, but it still spent a lot of time and manpower to purchase New Year's goods for each person. The relevant comrades were busy transporting, distributing, and delivering, which was quite tiring. During the Spring Festival, a few old friends got together and exchanged information, knowing that almost all units were doing the same. Some units even distributed more New Year's goods than ours. An old section chief laughed at my ignorance, saying, "The little bit you got is not even as much as the scraps of those with power." A newly promoted manager, whose salary is not high, has everything at home and is very generous. Others give him Maotai wine as gifts. I said these situations should be reported to higher authorities. An old friend mocked me: "You, my brother, should go to the park to practice Tai Chi and Qigong, cultivate your body and mind, and enjoy your retirement. Don't look for trouble. You treat these trivial matters as big deals, who will listen to you?!" The discussion ended there, and I had nothing to say. Thinking about the current society where bribery, embezzlement, theft, and corruption are rampant, and entertaining guests, giving gifts, and enriching oneself at public expense are common, setting up names to provide a little welfare for employees and distribute some goods is indeed trivial.

The central authorities have repeatedly emphasized the need to seriously rectify improper practices. I believe that rectifying improper practices and investigating illegal and disciplinary actions should not stop at words but must be implemented in actual actions, ensuring that orders are carried out and prohibitions are enforced, with no exceptions for anyone. Otherwise, serious investigation and rectification will become empty talk.

    年货联想
    今年春节，我的年货不仅富足，而且过剩。这些年货都是单位在节前先后送来的。计有：鸡4只、鸭4只、猪大腿2只（收下1只重14公斤的）、鱼7公斤、鸡腿鸡翅膀各1.5公斤、豆油5公斤、鸡蛋2.5公斤、花生2.5公斤、香油2瓶、洋河大曲2瓶、苹果5公斤、木耳200克。对离休干部的慰问品还未计在内。这些年货我估算了一下，按市价买要300多元，可我只付了100多元。
    我们单位是一个经济效益很差的省级公司，但还是用了不少时间、人力去采购人均一份的年货，有关同志忙运、忙分、忙送，真是辛苦得很。春节里，几位老朋友碰头一交流情况，知道几乎所有单位都是这么干的，有的比我们单位年货发得还多。有一位老处长笑我孤陋寡闻，他说，你分到的那一点，还不及那些有权人的零头多。一位新提拔的、工资并不高的经理，家里应有尽有，手脚也大方。别人向他进贡的是茅台酒。我说，这些情况应向上面反映。一位老友嘲讽我：“你老兄没事去公园打打太极拳，做做气功，修身养性，安度晚年，别自找没趣。你把这些鸡毛蒜皮的事当大事，谁理你？！”议论至此，我无言以对。想到当今社会上行贿受贿、贪污盗窃之风日盛，请客送礼、损公肥私比比皆是，至于巧立名目为职工谋点福利，分点财物，也就微不足道了。
    对不正之风，中央一再指出要严肃整治。我认为，整治不正之风，查处违法乱纪行为不能停留在口头上，必须落实到实际行动中，做到有令必行，有禁必止，任何人都不能例外。否则，严肃查处，治理整顿将成为空话。
