Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 11th.

The case of young worker Sun Fujun, who bravely fought against a criminal and was severely injured, has caused widespread outrage among the public after being publicly exposed in newspapers, radio, and television. The Luoyang First People's Hospital prioritized money over the patient, missed the critical window for blood transfusion, and ultimately led to Sun Fujun's quick death.

However, the Luoyang Medical Accident Assessment Committee issued a report yesterday stating: "Sun Fujun's death was due to the treating doctor's lack of understanding of heart chamber penetration injuries, resulting in a missed diagnosis. This caused a series of handling errors (monitoring, intravenous infusion, surgical preparation) to be insufficient, missing the surgical opportunity, and resulting in unsuccessful resuscitation. The report states: 'The patient was admitted without any formalities, and within half an hour, medical staff performed oxygen inhalation, dual-channel intravenous infusion, and debridement suturing. Through various efforts, the blood pressure rose from zero to 90/57 mmHg.' The direct cause of the patient's death was a heart chamber penetration injury leading to hemorrhagic shock."

Their medical technical assessment opinion on Sun Fujun's death is: "Sun Fujun's death does not constitute a medical accident, but there were serious errors in the diagnosis and treatment process."

After reading this report, many comrades are still puzzled about many issues in the Sun Fujun case, such as if the hospital exerted its full effort in the rescue process, then why was the injured person, after being brought to the hospital and informed of his brave fight with the criminal, still left lying on the dusty corridor floor? Why, when the patient's condition was critical and urgently needed blood, did the doctor demand "pay first, transfuse later"? Why, after the money was borrowed, did the nurse ignore the patient while chatting, causing a three-hour delay?

### 洛阳医疗部门如此鉴定  明明认钱不顾人贻误治疗  却称是漏诊不算医疗事故

　　洛阳医疗部门如此鉴定    
    明明认钱不顾人贻误治疗
    却称是漏诊不算医疗事故
    新华社北京５月１１日电  青年工人孙富君见义勇为与歹徒搏斗身负重伤，洛阳市第一人民医院认钱不认人，贻误输血时机，致使孙富君很快死亡的事情在报纸、电台、电视台公开披露后，引起广大群众的强烈愤慨。
    然而，本社昨天收到洛阳市医疗事故鉴定委员会的一份报告称：孙富君是“由于经治医生对心室穿透伤缺乏认识，造成漏诊，致使在一系列处理上（监护、输液、手术准备）不够得力，丧失了手术时机，抢救无效死亡”。报告说：“患者在没有办理任何手续的情况下收入院后，医务人员在半小时内进行了吸氧、双通道输液、清创缝合，经多方努力使血压由零回升到９０／５７ｍｍｈｇ”，“病人直接死亡原因为心室穿透伤致失血性休克”。
    他们对孙富君死亡的医疗技术鉴定意见是：“孙富君的死亡够不成医疗事故，但在诊疗过程中有严重错误”。
    看了这份报告，许多同志对孙富君事件中的不少问题仍迷惑不解，如说医院在抢救过程中尽了全力，那么为什么伤员送到医院里，并且介绍了他与歹徒英勇搏斗的情况，还让他躺在粉尘飞扬的走廊地板上？为什么伤员病情危险，急需输血，医生竟提出“先交钱，后输血”？为什么把钱筹借来，护士却聊天不予理睬，以致延误三个小时？
