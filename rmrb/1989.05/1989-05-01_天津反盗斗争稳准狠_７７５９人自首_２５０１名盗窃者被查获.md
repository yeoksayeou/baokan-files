Tianjin's Campaign Against Theft is Steady, Accurate, and Resolute
7,759 People Surrender; 2,501 Thieves Apprehended

People's Daily, Tianjin, May 1 — Reporter Xiao Di reports: A two-month campaign against theft has removed tens of thousands of criminals from Tianjin.

Last year, major theft cases increased by 54% compared to the previous year, adding to the concerns of Tianjin, a city known for its relatively good public security situation. Since last month, the city has launched a powerful campaign against theft. So far, 7,759 people have voluntarily confessed and surrendered; 2,501 thieves have been apprehended. A total of 5,273 theft cases have been solved, with seized cash and goods valued at over 2.44 million yuan. Criminal cases have significantly decreased.

The public has a deep hatred for thieves. In just two months, 9,710 pieces of criminal intelligence have been reported, creating a strong deterrent effect on thieves. In a criminal gang that committed 25 crimes in the northern suburbs, some members surrendered, and the rest were caught one by one. The public security, procuratorate, and judicial organs of Tianjin have used policy leverage, treating those who surrendered within the deadline leniently and severely punishing over 600 who continued to commit crimes. At the same time, concentrated forces were used to quickly investigate and solve cases involving those who refused to confess.

    ７７５９人自首　２５０１名盗窃者被查获
    本报天津５月１日电  记者肖荻报道：历时两个月的反盗斗争为天津翦除万名窃犯。
    去年重大盗窃案比上年上升５４％，给治安情况较好的天津市增添了忧虑。从上月起；全市开展了一场强有力的反盗窃专项斗争。迄今已有７７５９人主动坦白自首；２５０１名盗窃分子被查获。共破获盗窃案件５２７３起，缴获赃款赃物折合２４４万余元，刑事案件大幅度下降。
    广大群众对盗窃分子深为痛恨，两个月就揭发检举犯罪线索达９７１０件，对盗窃分子构成强大威慑力。北郊区一作案２５起的犯罪团伙中一些成员投案，其余被顺藤摸瓜一网打尽。天津市公、检、法机关运用政策力量，对在期限内自首的均予以从宽，对６００余名顶风作案的从严惩处。同时，对拒不坦白的集中优势兵力快侦快破。
