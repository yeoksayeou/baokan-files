    Zhenping County in Henan Province has conducted a comprehensive investigation into fraudulent "agricultural to non-agricultural" (农转非) status cases. Recently, the household registrations of 731 individuals who fraudulently obtained non-agricultural status have been canceled, and several individuals involved in the fraud have been disciplined.

    The county committee and county discipline inspection commission established a robust investigation team. They adopted the method of "investigate one case, influence a wider area" and first seriously handled the case in Zhishan Township, where 37 individuals had fraudulently obtained non-agricultural status. The police station chief was expelled from the Party, removed from his post, and transferred out of the public security force. Two deputy township-level officials and six other personnel involved in the case were also given Party and administrative disciplinary actions. The county discipline inspection commission publicly posted the list of individuals involved in the fraudulent "agricultural to non-agricultural" status cases, ensuring that the investigation remained under public supervision throughout.
