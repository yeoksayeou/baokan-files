The State Secrecy Law Comes into Effect Today
The Director of the State Secrecy Bureau Emphasizes that the State Secrecy Law is Beneficial for Reform and Opening Up, and Increases Government Transparency

Beijing, April 30th: Starting tomorrow, the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Guarding State Secrets" will come into effect. In this regard, the reporter interviewed Director Shen Hongying of the State Secrecy Bureau.

The reporter asked, "Some people are concerned that the implementation of the State Secrecy Law will hinder reform and opening up. What is your opinion on this?"

Shen Hongying pointed out that the State Secrecy Law, from its legislative purpose to its specific provisions, reflects the need for secrecy to adapt to the situation of reform and opening up. For example, the law defines the scope and duration of state secrets and confidentiality levels, as well as provisions for providing state secret items in foreign exchanges and cooperation, all of which are different from the past. I believe these provisions are beneficial for the implementation of the overall policy of reform and opening up.

Additionally, it should be noted that reform and opening up do not mean that the country's doors are wide open and there is no need for secrecy. Even some very open countries have their own set of regulations to ensure that their national secrets are not leaked.

In response to the reporter's question about whether the implementation of the State Secrecy Law will hinder government transparency, Shen Hongying said, "On this issue, we adhere to two principles: one is to increase the openness of the activities of leading organs, and the second is to strictly guard state secrets. According to the provisions of the State Secrecy Law, the items that need to be kept as state secrets are fewer than in the past, which is beneficial for increasing government transparency."

The reporter asked, "Could you talk about how to pay attention to secrecy issues in news reporting?"

Shen Hongying emphasized that, on the one hand, news workers need to have a sense of secrecy; on the other hand, the units or individuals providing news information have an important responsibility. Some people attribute the responsibility for leaks entirely to news organizations, which is unfair. We will promptly formulate corresponding regulations in accordance with the provisions of the State Secrecy Law.

The reporter finally asked, "Regarding the National People's Congress Standing Committee's adoption of the State Secrecy Law, there have been various speculations in foreign public opinion. Could you introduce the situation of the Standing Committee's deliberation on the State Secrecy Law?"

Shen Hongying revealed that, according to what is known, during the deliberation of China's State Secrecy Law in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the committee members all believed that it is necessary to formulate this law, and at the same time, strictly control the scope of state secrets, and not treat non-state secret items as secrets. When the State Secrecy Law was put to a vote in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, it received unanimous approval.

　　《保密法》今起施行    
     国家保密局局长强调保密法有利于改革开放、增加政府工作透明度
    本报北京４月３０日讯  记者毛磊报道：从明天起，《中华人民共和国保守国家秘密法》开始施行。为此，记者走访了国家保密局局长沈鸿英。
    记者问，有人担心施行《保密法》会妨碍改革开放，对此，您有何看法？
    沈鸿英指出，《保密法》从立法宗旨到条文内容，都体现了保密要适应改革开放的形势。如法中对国家秘密的定义和范围、密级和保密期限，以及在对外交往与合作中提供国家秘密事项等问题，都作了与过去不同的规定。我认为这些规定有利于改革开放总方针的贯彻执行。
    另外，需要指出的是，改革开放并不意味着国家禁门洞开、无须保密。世界上一些很开放的国家也都有一套法规制度，保障自己国家的秘密不被泄露。
    在回答记者提出的“施行《保密法》是否会妨碍政府工作透明度”这一问题时，沈鸿英说，在这个问题上，我们坚持两点：一要提高领导机关活动的开放程度，二要严格保守国家秘密。按照《保密法》的规定，需要作为国家秘密保守的事项比过去更少了，这就有利于增加政府工作的透明度。
    记者提出，您是否谈谈在新闻报道中如何注意保密问题？
    沈鸿英强调，一方面，新闻工作者要有保密意识；另一方面，提供新闻消息的单位或个人负有重要的责任。有人把泄密的责任全归于新闻单位，这是不公平的。我们将依照《保密法》的规定尽快制订出相应的制度。
    记者最后问，对我国人大常委会通过《保密法》，国外舆论有种种猜测，您是否介绍一下人大常委会审议《保密法》的情况？
    沈鸿英透露，据了解，我国的《保密法》在人大常委会审议过程中，委员们都认为，制定该法很有必要，同时要严格控制国家秘密的范围，不要把不是国家秘密的事项当作秘密来保。《保密法》在人大常委会交付表决时，得到了一致赞同。
