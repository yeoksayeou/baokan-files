	Yugoslavia is experiencing an abnormal climate, with heavy snowfall in May.

	Our reporter Yan Zheng reports from Belgrade on May 7th: Today, many areas in the southern part of Serbia, Yugoslavia, and the western regions of Macedonia experienced a sudden heavy snowfall. In Kopaonik, it snowed continuously for over 10 hours, with some places accumulating up to 10 centimeters of snow, creating a vast white landscape. Last night, in the central hilly areas of Podravina in Slovenia, a sudden blizzard caused significant damage to orchards, grasslands, and buildings.

	May in Yugoslavia is typically the beginning of summer, with temperatures reaching around 25 degrees Celsius. However, in the past couple of days, it has unexpectedly snowed like in the depths of winter. Local residents say this is the first time they have experienced such a phenomenon, making it a rare occurrence.

　　南斯拉夫气候异常    
    时序五月大雪纷扬
    本报贝尔格莱德５月７日电  记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫塞尔维亚共和国南部许多地区和马其顿共和国的西部地区，突然纷纷扬扬下起鹅毛大雪，其中在科帕奥尼克整整下了１０个多小时，还有许多地方积雪厚达１０厘米，呈现一片白茫茫的世界。昨天夜里，在斯洛文尼亚共和国波德里涅的中部山丘地带，顷刻间也是狂风卷着大雪，给果园、草地和房屋造成了巨大的损失。
    南斯拉夫５月已是初夏季节，前一阵最高温度达到摄氏２５度左右，这一两天竟下起寒冬时的大雪，当地居民都说是首次所遇，实属罕见。
