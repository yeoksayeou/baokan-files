The stone graphite mine built near our village of Xueying Nanchengzi in Lingbao County has been disregarding environmental protection laws for 14 years, recklessly discharging graphite dust and wastewater. The ecological balance has been disrupted, and the seven-color world given to us by nature has been replaced by black. At the same time, graphite pollution severely affects the growth of crops such as cotton, tobacco, and fruit trees, and livestock often fall ill and die.

We have repeatedly negotiated with the mine, and through the mediation of the town mayor and judicial officer, the mine agreed to resolve the pollution issue by the New Year of 1988. However, everything remains the same to this day.

　　把我们从黑色世界救出来
    建在我们薛营南城子附近的灵宝县石墨矿置环境保护法于不顾，肆意排放石墨粉尘和污水已整整１４个年头了，生态平衡遭到破坏，大自然赐给我们的七色世界，被黑色代替了。同时，石墨污染严重影响棉花、烟叶、果树等作物的生长，牲畜也时常生病死亡。
    我们曾几次与矿方交涉，经镇长和司法员的调解，矿方答应１９８８年元旦解决污染问题，但至今一切依旧。
