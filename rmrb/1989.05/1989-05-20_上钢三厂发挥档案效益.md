Shanggang Sanchang (Shanghai Steel Plant No. 3) actively utilizes its archives, emphasizing the benefits of archives, and has achieved significant results.

Currently, the archives of Shanggang Sanchang store over 16,000 volumes of various documents. The archives department actively develops and utilizes these documents to serve the factory's major and medium repairs and equipment updates and renovations. They also serve to strengthen measurement, quality management, and product excellence activities, and provide solid evidence for compiling various annuals and the factory's history. According to incomplete statistics, in recent years, the benefits generated from utilizing archives have exceeded 100 million yuan, which is 20 times the total investment in the entire archives management facilities.

During the design, construction, and installation of the 2nd cold rolling machine in the cold rolling thin plate workshop, the archives of the 1st cold rolling machine were utilized, ensuring that the project was designed, constructed, and put into production in the same year. Just by calculating the time saved from early completion, the project earned 60 million yuan. When the 25-ton converter body and transmission equipment in the converter workshop underwent major repairs, the contracting unit initially quoted a price of 280,000 yuan. After accurate calculations based on relevant archives, the project cost was determined to be 183,000 yuan, saving nearly 100,000 yuan in repair costs.

　　上钢三厂发挥档案效益
    新华社上海电  （实习生朱矫健、记者严卫民）上海钢铁三厂积极利用档案，注重档案效益，取得了明显效果。
    目前，上钢三厂档案馆储存各类档案１．６万多卷。档案处积极开发利用这些档案，为全厂大中修和设备更新、改造服务，为加强计量、质量管理和产品创优等活动服务，并为编写各类《年鉴》及《厂史》提供确凿依据。据不完全统计，几年来利用档案产生的效益达１０００万元以上，是整个档案管理设施投入的２０倍。
    在冷轧薄板分厂２号冷轧机的设计、施工、安装工程中，利用了１号冷轧机的档案，使这一工程做到了当年设计，当年施工，当年投产。仅以提前完工的时间计算，就获利６００万元。转炉分厂２５吨转炉炉体及传动设备大修时，承包单位预算要价２８万元。后根据有关档案进行准确核算，核定工程费用为１８．３万元，节约了近１０万元的大修费用。
