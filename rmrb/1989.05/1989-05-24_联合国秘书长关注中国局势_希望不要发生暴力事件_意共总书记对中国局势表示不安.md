Italian Communist Party Secretary-General Expresses Unease About China's Situation

	New China News Agency, Rome, May 23rd: The Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, Occhetto, this afternoon visited the Chinese Embassy in Italy to express his unease and concern about the current situation in China.

	After inquiring about the current situation in China from Ambassador Du Gang, Secretary-General Occhetto stated that the Italian Communist Party sincerely hopes that the Chinese government will properly handle the events that have occurred in Beijing and many other major cities across the country. He believes that "this is not only important for China but also for the entire world."

    新华社联合国五月二十三日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔日前发表谈话，对中国的局势表示关注。秘书长二十二日向聚集在安理会会议厅外的记者说，他“一直希望在中国不要发生暴力事件”。他表示相信，没有任何人愿意发生暴力事件，“中国人自己也希望以非暴力的方式解决问题”。
    新华社罗马五月二十三日电　意共总书记奥凯托今天下午来到中国驻意大利大使馆，对中国目前局势表示不安和忧虑。
    奥凯托总书记在向杜攻大使询问了中国当前的形势后表示，意大利共产党真诚地希望中国政府妥善地对待在北京和全国其他许多大城市出现的事件。他认为，“这不仅对中国，而且对整个世界都是十分重要的”。他说，这次事件的顺利解决可以表明，“社会主义国家能够不断地实现进步和民主化；反之，对中国的形象和世界进步力量则都将是极为不利的。”
    奥凯托说，“我们本着友好和同情的心情表达上述的意见，我们意大利共产党人对中国的改革是十分关注的”。
