After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the land in West Xiji Village, Tongliao City, Inner Mongolia, was also contracted to individual households. Farming for food, raising livestock for meat and milk, this has been the traditional practice in West Xiji Village for thousands of years. People believed that this was the proper way to live.

Party Secretary Bāo Jīnshān and old party member Guō Jīnshān, however, believed that to break this traditional practice and develop a commodity economy, they needed to diversify their operations, plant more trees, grow more grass, and improve livestock breeding and processing industries. Over the past few years, Bāo Jīnshān has taken out more than 3,000 yuan from his own family to lend to impoverished households to develop production. The impoverished household of Zhang Bǎoyù has seven people, with four laborers, but relying solely on farming made life very difficult. The brothers had all remained bachelors. Bāo Jīnshān gave him advice on getting rich and encouraged him to plant more trees. Zhang Bǎoyù planted over 100 mu of trees in two years, and also planted trees and seedlings in front of and behind his house, increasing his family's income and making life much better. His elder brother and younger brother both got married, and Zhang Bǎoyù was honored to become the forestry labor model of the entire league.

Zhang Bǎoyù's success in getting rich through afforestation aroused the envy of other impoverished households. They also wanted to plant trees, but lacked seedlings. Bāo Jīnshān had already cultivated more than 70,000 tree seedlings in the land he contracted, selling them at a low price to the impoverished households in the village.

Under the influence of Bāo Jīnshān, the party members in West Xiji Village actively did good deeds for the impoverished households, with those who had money contributing money, those who had goods contributing goods, and those who had skills providing technical guidance. The impoverished household of Liù Lùyù had no education or skills, although there were laborers in the family, they did not know how to get rich. Old party member Guō Jīnshān taught him how to plant trees and grass and helped him cultivate seedlings. Deputy Village Head Dá Shíchéngxǐ lent 500 yuan in cash to impoverished households to buy seeds, fertilizer, and seedlings.

On the road to prosperity, the party members in West Xiji Village indeed set an example for the people. They changed the past mistaken idea of "implementing the responsibility system, no need for the party branch," and felt that party members and the people were different. They deeply felt, "If you want to pursue the path to wealth, rely on the party branch."

In the spring of 1984, Bāo Jīnshān went to the city to attend a spiritual civilization construction commendation meeting. The municipal committee proposed to beautify, fragrance, and green the cityscape. Bāo Jīnshān immediately caught a piece of information from this. He returned to the village without even going home, and rushed to Guō Jīnshān's house to discuss with old Guō the mobilization of villagers to plant various seedlings and flowers in front of and behind each house. In 1985, the entire village earned 300,000 yuan from this alone, and the income increased to more than 800,000 yuan the following year. In 1988, the total agricultural and pastoral income of West Xiji Village was 11.6 million yuan, more than ten times that of 1980. West Xiji, which had eaten 14 years of relief grain, sold 400,000 kilograms of commercial grain to the state in 1988. Ten years ago, this place was a "bare-bottomed village" with countable trees; now there are more than 10,000 mu of forest land, with 960 mu of farmland protection forest alone; ten years ago, every family was in debt and every household lacked food, now it has become an advanced example of developing a commodity economy. The 14 households that moved away to escape poverty have now all returned.

What force brought such great changes to West Xiji Village? Party Secretary Bāo Jīnshān summed it up in four sentences: "The party's policies are good, the people's enthusiasm is high, farming is scientific, and the weather helped." However, the people of West Xiji Village said: "This is true, but we should add one more sentence, if there were no good leaders like Bāo Jīnshān, West Xiji would still be poor!"

　　切切实实给群众以帮助    
    ——通辽市西喜嘎查党支部带领群众致富记
    王金堂
    党的十一届三中全会以后，内蒙古通辽市西喜嘎查的土地也承包到户了。种田—吃饭、养畜—吃肉、喝奶，这是西喜嘎查延续几千年的传统习惯。人们认为，只有这样做才是本分。
    党支部书记包金山和老党员郭金山则认为，为了破除这种传统习惯，发展商品经济，就要发展多种经营，多种树，多种草，搞好养殖业和加工业。这几年，包金山从自己家拿出３０００多元借给贫困户发展生产。贫困户张宝玉家７口人，有４个劳动力，只因单靠种地，日子过得很艰难，哥儿几个一直打光棍。包金山为他出致富主意，鼓励他多栽树。张宝玉两年造林１００多亩，还在房前屋后栽树育苗，增加了家庭收入，日子好过多了。他的哥哥和弟弟都娶上了媳妇，张宝玉还光荣地当上了全盟林业劳动模范。
    张宝玉靠造林致富，引起了贫困户羡慕。他们也想栽树，可是缺少苗木。包金山早已在他承包的地里为大家育好７万多株树苗，以低价卖给了本嘎查的贫困户。
    在包金山的带动下，西喜嘎查的党员主动为贫困户做好事，有钱的出钱，有物的出物，有技术的作技术指导。贫困户刘录一无文化，二无技术，家中虽有劳力，但想富不会富。老党员郭金山教他种树种草，帮他培育树苗。副嘎查达石成喜把５００多元现金借给贫困户买种子、化肥和树苗。
    在致富的道路上，西喜嘎查的党员们确实给群众树立了榜样。使大家改变了过去那种“实行责任制，不要党支部”的错误看法，感到党员和群众就是不一样，并深有感触地说：“要想奔富路，依靠党支部”。
    １９８４年春，包金山到市里参加精神文明建设表彰会时，市委提出要美化、香化、绿化市容。包金山立即从中捕捉到一条信息。他回到嘎查没进家门，就奔郭金山家，同老郭商量发动村民在各家房前屋后都栽上各种树苗和花卉。１９８５年全嘎查仅这项收入就达３万元，第二年收入增加到８万多元。１９８８年，西喜嘎查的农牧业总收入１１６万元，是１９８０年的１０倍多。过去吃了１４年返销粮的西喜，１９８８年一次就向国家交售商品粮４０多万公斤。十年前，这里还是个“光腚村”，树木可数；如今有林地上万亩，仅农田防护林就达９６０亩；十年前这里是家家欠款，户户缺粮，如今成为发展商品经济的先进典型。过去为逃避贫困而搬走的１４户人家，如今全部迁了回来。
    是什么力量给西喜嘎查带来如此大的变化呢？党支部书记包金山用四句话来概括：“党的政策好，群众干劲高，种田讲科学，老天帮了忙。”可是西喜嘎查的群众却说：“这倒是事实，不过还应加上一句，若没有像包金山这样的好带头人，西喜恐怕还是姓‘贫’！”
