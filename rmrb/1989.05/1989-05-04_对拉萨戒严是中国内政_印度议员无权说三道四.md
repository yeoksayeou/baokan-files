The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that some Indian parliamentarians commenting on the imposition of martial law in Lhasa is interference in China's internal affairs.

A reporter asked: According to foreign news reports, 55 Indian parliamentarians (including 36 from the Indian National Congress) have written to Premier Li Peng, criticizing China for imposing martial law in Lhasa, West Tibet. What is China's response to this?

The spokesperson replied, "Recently, a small number of separatist elements deliberately created disturbances in Lhasa, seriously endangering social stability. The Chinese government's decision to impose martial law in Lhasa has received widespread support from people of all ethnic groups across the country, including the broad masses of the Tibetan people. Some Indian parliamentarians commenting on this is interference in China's internal affairs, which not only contradicts the publicly stated position of the Indian government but also is not conducive to the development of Sino-Indian relations."

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "Tibet is an inseparable part of China. Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs. No foreign government, parliament, organization, or individual has the right to interfere."

　　对拉萨戒严是中国内政    
    印度议员无权说三道四
    新华社北京５月４日电  外交部发言人今天在这里说，印度部分议员对拉萨戒严说三道四，是对中国内政的干涉。
    有记者问：据外电报道，印度５５名议员（其中３６名是国大党议员）致信李鹏总理，指责中国在西藏拉萨实行戒严。对此，中方有何评论？
    发言人回答说，不久前，少数分裂主义分子在拉萨蓄意制造骚乱，严重危害了社会安定。中国政府宣布对拉萨戒严，得到了全国各族人民包括西藏广大人民的普遍拥护，印度部分议员对此说三道四，是对中国内政的干涉，不仅与印度政府公开申明的立场不符，也不利于中印关系的发展。
    外交部发言人说，“西藏是中国不可分割的一部分，西藏事务是中国的内政，任何外国政府、议会、组织或个人均无权干涉。”
