The rapid recovery and development of Japan's economy were primarily achieved through domestic financial resources, with domestic funds mainly coming from savings.

Savings Play a Significant Role in Japan's Economic Operations

In the early post-World War II period, 42% of Japan's national wealth was destroyed by the war, and 40% of urban buildings and industrial equipment were damaged. Production stagnated, resources were scarce, and everything was in ruins. Financially, the government, enterprises, and households all faced deficits, making it difficult to find sources of funds for economic recovery. Thus, a "National Savings Movement" was launched among the entire population.

To increase savings, bank employees took every opportunity to promote savings through speeches and other activities. The Ministry of Finance's Banking Bureau negotiated with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, which controlled resources, to allocate items such as rubber shoes, umbrellas, and bicycles to encourage savings activities. Even children's "housekeeping" games led to the establishment and popularization of "Children's Banks." The "National Savings Movement" quickly reversed the declining trend in savings rates, providing valuable financial resources for economic recovery.

Savings can also act as a supply-demand regulator. The imbalance between a country's total supply and total demand is a common phenomenon. When total supply is less than total demand, the money supply exceeds the available goods. In this situation, savings can slow down the price increase caused by demand; they can convert part of personal consumption funds into production capital, used to expand the production and supply of goods, making supply and demand tend towards balance. For example, in the early post-war period, Japan's "National Savings Movement" and frozen deposit measures utilized this function of savings. When total supply exceeds total demand, savings provide the government with the financial flexibility to implement policies that stimulate demand. For instance, after the oil crisis, the Japanese government issued large amounts of national bonds to expand demand and stimulate economic development. From 1971 to 1985, the accumulated amount of national bonds as a percentage of the year's GDP rose from 6.7% to 50%. However, Japan did not experience severe economic problems, especially after 1975, when domestic wholesale and retail prices remained relatively stable. One reason for this was the existence of a large amount of domestic savings, which absorbed the public debt.

Moreover, to catch up with European and American developed countries, Japan conducted sustained, large-scale equipment investments after the war, and the support for this was sustained high savings. From 1951 to 1978, Japan's total savings rate averaged over 30%, reaching 42% in 1961. Sustained high savings continuously made up for the inherent deficiencies in capital accumulation, promoting rapid economic development. Economic development, in turn, increased the sources of savings, forming a virtuous cycle: increased savings → increased investment and employment → economic growth → increased income → further increased savings. If Japan became the second-largest economic power in the capitalist world in terms of GDP in 1967, surpassing France and West Germany, then as early as twenty years ago, Japan was already the leading "savings nation" in the capitalist world. Now, this "economic powerhouse" of Japan can, to some extent, be said to have transformed from a "savings nation."

Additionally, during Japan's high-speed economic development period after the war, 72.3% to 89.5% of total savings were channeled to enterprises through banks, insurance companies, and other indirect financial institutions, forming the following constraints: One layer is the depositor's constraint on financial institutions, i.e., the obligation to repay principal and interest upon maturity. Most of Japan's financial institutions are privately operated, similar to other private companies and enterprises, aiming to maximize profits. For this reason, before lending, they conduct strict and detailed examinations and selections of the borrower, and after lending, they conduct meticulous supervision. The other layer is the constraint of financial institutions on borrowing companies and enterprises, forcing enterprises to strengthen self-discipline, to produce as much added value as possible with the least amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, so that after paying taxes and repaying loan principal and interest, there is more surplus.

As mentioned earlier, increasing savings helps stabilize prices. However, the increase in savings generally requires the stability of prices and currency value. Because a significant increase in prices will make people have a preference for goods over money, which is not conducive to the stability of savings and financial order, and not conducive to the stability of the market and the economy. However, Japan's statistics show that the maintenance of a high savings rate is not due to the absence of significant price increases or the fact that the increase in interest rates is greater than the increase in prices. From 1955 to 1985, Japan's comprehensive wholesale prices increased by 1.4 times, and retail prices increased by 4.3 times, while the interest rate for a one-year fixed deposit fell from 6.0% to 5.5%. In 1974, the comprehensive wholesale price index increased by 23.2% compared to the previous year, and the retail price index increased by 28.2%, while the interest rate for a one-year fixed deposit only increased by 1.5%, which can be said to have resulted in a clear negative interest rate. However, the deposit balance still increased by 9.0% compared to the previous year.

Why did the savings amount still show a significant increase in the face of significant price increases and the appearance of negative interest rates? Apart from the increase in nominal wages, there are other reasons. The following analysis is based on the motives and formation of savings by the savings subjects.

Savings Motives and Their Formation

From the composition of savings subjects, a country's total savings = household savings + corporate savings + government savings. Different savings subjects have different savings motives and formation causes.

Household savings mainly consider "personal burdens." Compared to the speed of economic development, the improvement of national welfare in Japan is significantly lagging behind. It was not until the early 1960s that Japan established a pension insurance system for all citizens. This insurance system is based on the principle of shared responsibility among individuals, enterprises, and the state. Generally, companies or enterprises, in addition to paying wages and contributing a portion of employees' pension insurance according to regulations, do not do much else. Many small and medium-sized enterprises do not even provide this pension insurance. Various labor insurance and welfare benefits are basically solved by individuals participating in social insurance.

Medical treatment and prevention require participation in medical insurance. Japan's medical expenses are quite high. By joining medical insurance and paying a certain amount of insurance premiums monthly, medical expenses can be reduced by 70% when seeing a doctor.

Children's kindergarten and university tuition fees are also fully borne by individuals. According to a survey, in 1988, the average cost for a university student was 2,123,000 yen, equivalent to 7 to 8 months of total wages for a middle-income earner.

Japanese women generally stop working after marriage or giving birth. After their children grow up, they often work part-time. Their medical care, pensions, etc., are also solved by paying various insurance premiums monthly.

Housing is a significant expense for Japanese families. If renting a house, the monthly rent is about 1/3 to 1/4 of the middle-income earner's wage. Therefore, most families hope to build their own houses. To build a house, they need to save half of the housing construction costs to obtain a housing construction loan. After the house is built, they need to live frugally to repay the loan. Many people spend a lifetime or even half a lifetime saving to build their own house.

Additionally, 99% of Japanese enterprises are small and medium-sized, and more than 80% of the workforce is employed in small and medium-sized enterprises. The risk of bankruptcy and unemployment can strike them at any time. The strategy individuals can take is to increase savings during periods of wage income to enhance self-insurance capabilities.

As for children's medical care, insurance, housing, etc., these are also borne by individuals.

The above burdens constrain residents' consumption and savings behavior. Even if prices are rising, future days still need to be lived, and savings cannot be spent entirely. Moreover, savings in the form of medical insurance, children's insurance, spousal insurance, family property insurance, and pension insurance cannot be withdrawn at will. Even if negative interest rates have already appeared, housing savings or installment payments for housing loans cannot be reduced, and various insurance premiums cannot be unpaid. This, to a certain extent, inhibits the decline of savings and also inhibits the impact of savings on the market.

Corporate savings motives stem from survival crises. Japanese enterprises are filled with fierce competition. Each enterprise strives to maximize accumulation. For a single enterprise, when accumulation is still in the form of money (or financial assets) and has not been actually used for investment, it exists in the form of corporate savings.

In major capitalist countries, Japan's corporate self-capitalization rate is the lowest. More than 70% of the capital used by enterprises is raised from external sources. However, despite the fact that each enterprise is under the same financial system, the capital composition is the same, specifically for each enterprise, there cannot be a lack of crisis awareness.

A Comprehensive Financial System and Attentive Service for Absorbing Savings

The formation of high savings in Japan is, on the one hand, due to the strong demand for savings from households, enterprises, etc., and on the other hand, due to a financial system that can fully absorb savings and attentive financial services.

Strict confidentiality to gain the trust of depositors. Losing the trust of depositors is equivalent to losing the source of savings. To gain the trust of depositors, various financial institutions in Japan have a strict confidentiality system and regard it as an important part of educating new employees.

A sound network of branches to facilitate savings. Japan's financial network has many branches and is relatively evenly distributed.

Utilizing modern equipment to save time for deposits and withdrawals. Most financial institutions in Japan are equipped with computers. Some banks even set up automatic cash deposit and withdrawal machines in busy streets, shops, stations, hotels, etc., and post offices are also equipped with automatic cash deposit and withdrawal devices. Customers can deposit or withdraw cash by inserting a magnetic code credit card into the machine and pressing a few keys, taking no more than two minutes.

One account, multiple uses. Customers only need to open an account at a bank and obtain a cash credit card, and they can deposit or withdraw cash at various branches of that bank. With the widespread use of automatic cash deposit and withdrawal machines, major banks have also established a computer interbank automatic processing system.

Various forms of savings promotion. Japan's savings promotion is not limited to participating in savings for the benefit of the country, the people, and oneself, but also introduces the characteristics of "financial products," their applicability to various savings purposes, interest rates, tax preferences, and how to skillfully use them, etc.

Attentive service to win the hearts of depositors. The key to attracting more customers is to win their hearts. To do this, it is necessary to use persistent high-quality service and superior service tactics to move people's hearts. These services can be roughly divided into the following aspects:

Counter service. In Japan, regardless of which financial institution customers go to, they first hear a warm welcome, and a staff member wearing a badge stands ready to serve customers, answer customers' inquiries, and guide customers to the designated counter. For customers who come to open an account for the first time, they also give small gifts such as napkins, towels, handkerchiefs, or toilet paper, plastic wrap, etc., to express thanks.

Consultation service. Financial institutions generally have consultation counters that provide free consultation services, answer customers' inquiries, act as financial advisors for customers, and help them choose suitable financial asset preservation methods.

Transfer service. Mainly includes salary transfer, various insurance fee transfer, rent, water, electricity, and gas fee transfer, shopping transfer, notification transfer, etc. In addition, individuals renting hotels or eating in restaurants can also adopt the billing and automatic transfer method.

After-sales service. Many financial institutions strengthen their contact with customers in various ways, such as sending maturity notices to customers whose fixed deposits are about to mature, reminding them of the maturity date of their deposits, and the amount of interest that can be obtained after deducting interest income tax.

In summary, Japan has a mechanism for creating high savings, making the Japanese economy itself have a strong blood-making function, enabling it to achieve world-renowned economic development by relying on domestic financial resources in a situation of long-term lack of funds.

From April 1st, the Japanese government imposed a 3% consumption tax on all domestic consumer goods, causing the prices of most goods to rise.

### 从“储蓄大国”到“经济大国”

　　从“储蓄大国”到“经济大国”
    张舒英
    日本经济的迅速恢复与发展，基本上是靠本国财力来实现的，而国内资金则主要来源于储蓄。
    　　　　储蓄在日本经济运行中起了很大作用
    二次世界大战结束初期，日本国民财富的４２％毁于战火，４０％的城市建筑和工业设备遭到破坏。生产停滞，物资奇缺，百废待兴。财力方面无论国家、企业或家庭皆有赤字，很难找到恢复经济所需要的资金来源。于是在全体国民中展开“救国储蓄运动”。
    为增加储蓄，银行职工利用各种机会奔走、演讲，积极从事储蓄宣传活动。大藏省银行局为此出面同掌管物资的商工省交涉，提请配给胶鞋、旱伞、自行车等物资，用以鼓励储蓄活动。连孩子们“过家家”搞的银行游戏也引来了“儿童银行”的建立和普及。“救国储蓄运动”使日本较快扭转了储蓄率下降局面，为恢复经济提供了宝贵的资金来源。
    储蓄还可以起供求调节阀的作用。一个国家的总供给与总需求的不平衡是经常存在的。当总供给小于总需求时，货币供应量就多于可供消费的物资量。在此情况下，储蓄可以减缓需求对物价上涨的推进；将一部分个人消费基金转化为生产资本，用于扩大物资生产与供给，使供给与需求朝大体平衡方向发展。如战后初期，日本的“救国储蓄运动”以及冻结存款措施，即利用储蓄的这种作用。当总供给大于总需求时，储蓄为政府采取刺激需求的政策提供机动财力。比如，石油危机后，日本政府为扩大需求和刺激经济发展，连年发行大量国债。从１９７１年到１９８５年，国债累积额占当年国民生产总值的比率由６．７％上升到５０％。然而，日本并没发生了不得的经济问题，特别是１９７５年后，国内批发物价和零售物价一直比较稳定，原因之一在于国内存在大量储蓄，消化了公债。
    另外，日本为了赶超欧美发达国家，战后进行了持续、大规模的设备投资，而支撑它的正是持续的高储蓄。从１９５１年到１９７８年，日本的总储蓄率平均在３０％以上，１９６１年高达４２％。持续的高储蓄不断弥补着资本积累先天不足的缺陷，促进经济的高速发展。经济发展又反过来增加了储蓄源泉，形成一种良性循环：储蓄增加——投资和就业量增大——经济增长——收入增多——储蓄进一步增加……。如果说日本于１９６７年在国民生产总值上超过法国和西德成为资本主义世界中的第二经济大国，那么，早在二十年前，日本就已是资本主义世界中首屈一指的“储蓄大国”。现在日本这一“经济大国”在某种意义上可以说是由“储蓄大国”转换来的。
    此外，战后日本经济高速发展时期，总储蓄的７２．３％至８９．５％系通过银行、保险公司等间接金融机构融通给企业，形成了如下的制约机制：一层是储户对金融机构的制约，即到期必须偿付本息。日本的金融机构绝大部分由民间经营，如同其他私营公司、企业，以获取尽可能多的收益为目标。为此，在贷款前对借方进行严格细致的审查与挑选，贷款后进行周密的监督。另一层即金融机构对借款公司和企业等的制约，迫使企业加强自我约束，以尽可能少的人财物力消耗，生产尽可能多的附加价值，以便在纳税和归还贷款本息后能有更多的剩余。
    如前所述，增加储蓄有利于稳定物价。但是，储蓄的增加，一般又以物价和货币币值的稳定为条件。因为，物价大幅度上涨会使人们产生重物轻钱心理，不利于稳定储蓄和金融秩序，不利于稳定市场和经济。但是，日本的统计资料表明，高储蓄率的维持并不是因为物价没有过大幅度上涨，也不是因为利率的提高幅度大于物价上涨幅度。１９５５年—１９８５年，日本的综合批发物价上涨了１．４倍，零售物价上涨４．３倍，定期１年的存款利率却由６．０％降到５．５％。１９７４年的综合批发物价指数比前一年增高２３．２％，零售物价指数增高２８．２％，定期１年的存款利率仅提高了１．５％，可以说出现了明显的负利率，然而存款余额却仍较上年增长９．０％。
    为什么在物价大幅度上涨、并出现负利率情况下，储蓄额仍能有明显的增长？这除了名义工资有所增长外，还另有原因。下面从储蓄主体的动机及其形成原因进行分析。
    　　　　储蓄动机及其形成原因
    从储蓄主体的构成看，一国的总储蓄＝居民储蓄＋企业储蓄＋政府储蓄。储蓄主体不同，储蓄动机及其形成原因也各异。
    居民储蓄主要考虑“个人负担”。与经济的发展速度相比，日本国民福利的提高是大大滞后的。６０年代初，日本才建立以全体国民为对象的养老金保险制度。这种保险体系以个人、企业、国家共同分担为基本原则。一般的公司或企业除给职工发工资和按规定比例缴纳一部分职工养老保险金外，什么都不管。不少中小企业连这点养老保险金也不提供。各种劳保福利基本上靠个人参加社会保险解决。
    防病治病要通过参加医疗保险解决。日本的医药费是相当贵的。加入医疗保险，按月缴纳一定数额的保险费，看病时，医疗费用可减轻７０％。
    孩子入托、上大学等费用也完全由个人负担。据调查，１９８８年大学生平均每人要花２１２．３万日元，相当于中等收入水平者７、８个月的全部工资。
    日本的妇女一般在结婚或生小孩后，就停止工作。孩子长大后再参加工作也多是计时工。她们的医疗保健、养老保险等也都是通过逐月交纳各种保险费解决。
    住房是日本家庭的一大笔开销。如果租房住，每月的房租约是中等收入水平者工资的１／３—１／４。因此一般家庭都希望建一套自己的住宅。要建房，得攒够住宅建设费用的一半才能取得住宅建设贷款。房子盖起来后，还得勤俭度日，清偿贷款。许多人为建设一套自己的住宅而节俭大半生乃至一生。
    此外，日本的企业９９％以上是中小企业，就业人口的８０％以上是在中小企业。倒闭和失业的危险不知什么时候就会向他们袭来。个人所能采取的对策便是在有工资收入时增加储蓄，增强自我保险能力。
    至于子女的医疗、保险、住房等等，也都是由个人负担。
    上述负担便制约着居民的消费行为和储蓄行为。即使物价看涨，以后的日子还得过，不能把储蓄全花光。再说，以医疗保险、儿童保险、夫妇保险、家庭财产保险、养老保险等形式进行的储蓄是不能随意提取的。即使已经出现负利率，建房积金或分期偿还的住宅贷款不能少，各种保险费不能不交。这就在一定程度上抑制着储蓄滑坡的现象，也抑制着储蓄对市场的冲击。
    企业储蓄动机源于生存危机。日本企业之间，充满激烈竞争。每个企业都力争最大限度地增加积累。对于单个企业来说，当积累尚处于货币（或金融资产）形态而未实际用于投资之前，就以企业储蓄的形式存在。
    日本的企业储蓄占储蓄总量的比重约为１／３，有时甚至更高。
    在主要资本主义国家中，日本企业的自有资本率是最低的。企业所用资本的７０％以上靠从外部筹措。然而，尽管各个企业处于同样的金融体系之下，资本构成都彼此彼此，具体到每个企业来说，不可能没有危机感。
    　　　　充分吸收储蓄的金融系统和周到的服务
    日本高储蓄的形成，一方面在于家庭、企业等对储蓄的强烈需求，另一方面也在于有一套充分吸收储蓄的金融系统和周到的金融服务。
    严格保密，取信于储户。失去储户信任就等于失去储蓄来源。为了取信于储户，日本各类金融机构都有一套严格的保密制度，并把它作为教育新职员的重要内容之一。
    健全网点，方便储蓄。日本的金融网点，一是数量多，二是分布较均匀。
    利用现代设备，节省存取时间。日本的金融机构大都装备有电子计算机。有的银行还在闹市、商店、车站、旅馆等处设置现金自动存取机，邮局也都安装了现金自动存取设备。顾客存款取款，只需将带磁性暗号的信用卡插入机器，敲几下键盘，不消两分钟就可存入（或取出）现金。
    一处开户，多处通用。顾客只要在某家银行开立帐户，办一张现金信用卡，便可以在这家银行的各个分支机构存取现金。随着现金自动存取机的广泛应用，各家大银行之间还建立了计算机联行自动处理系统。
    多种形式，宣传储蓄。日本对储蓄的宣传，不是停留在参加储蓄利国利民又利己这种大道理上，而是详细介绍“金融商品”的特点，适用于哪些储蓄目的，利率以及税收上有无优惠，如何巧妙地加以利用等等。
    服务周到，赢得储户。争取更多客户的关键是赢得人心。为此就需要以持之以恒的优质服务、胜人一筹的服务战术去打动人心。这些服务大致可分为如下几方面：
    柜台服务。在日本，不论是去哪家金融机构，顾客一进门首先听到的是欢迎光临的热情招呼，一名佩戴标志的工作人员站立迎候，随时准备为顾客服务，回答顾客的问询，引导顾客到指定的柜台。对于第一次来开户的客户，还赠送餐巾纸、毛巾、手绢或卫生纸、塑料保鲜膜等小礼品表示感谢。
    咨询服务。金融机构一般都设有咨询台，免费提供咨询服务，解答顾客的问询，给顾客当金融参谋，帮助他们选择合适的金融资产保存方式。
    转帐服务。主要有工资转帐、各种保险费转帐、房水电煤气费转帐、购物转帐、通知转帐等。此外，个人租用旅馆、在饭店吃饭等，也可以采取记帐和自动转帐的方式。
    售后服务。许多金融机构以各种方式加强同客户的联系，例如：给定期存款快到期的客户发到期通知单，提醒他存款哪天到期，期满后扣除利息所得税可得到的利息额等。
    总之，日本存在着一套制造高储蓄的机制，使日本经济自身具有强健的造血功能，使它能在资金长期不足的情况下，依靠本国财力取得举世瞩目的经济发展。
