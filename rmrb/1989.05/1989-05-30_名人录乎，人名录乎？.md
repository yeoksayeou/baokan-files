Sometimes, one reads about a fellow countryman being listed in a certain country's directory of notable individuals, and as a member of the Chinese nation, one feels a sense of pride. Upon closer inspection, it turns out to be included in a certain edition of Who’s Who. Literally translated, it can be rendered as "Directory of Names," but in reality, it is a type of biographical dictionary.

Such directories are numerous in economically and culturally developed countries. There are comprehensive ones, such as the American Directory of Names and the French Directory of Names; there are also specialized ones, such as the International Writers Directory, the International Educational Directory, and the Economic and Business Directory, among others. Some are organized by institutions, such as the Directory of European Organizations and Other Institutions, and the Directory of European Businesses and Enterprises, and so on.

All of the above directories or lists include only living individuals or currently existing organizations.

There is another category that is specifically targeted at a particular historical period. For example, the Directory of the First World War, the Directory of the Second World War, and even two directories of world mapmakers, listing individuals who have created and printed maps over several centuries.

There is also a category that is clearly used for political and economic intelligence. For example, the West German-issued Directory of Soviet Individuals (1984), which collects information on individuals from various sectors of the Soviet Union, including those who have retired, been expelled, demoted, or reduced in rank.

Regarding China, there is the Directory of Communist China published in Hong Kong in 1966. It includes the Eighth Central Committee, provincial and municipal party committees, the National Defense Council, the Political Consultative Conference, and various military departments. These were all intended for studying the "opposing side" at that time.

These directories of names are all reference books of a dictionary nature. They only provide facts without commentary. For example, the entry for "Kissinger" in the International Directory of Names is only about three hundred characters long, including his date of birth, education, parents, children, positions held, organizations joined, and books published. Generally speaking, the directories include both positive and negative figures. To avoid controversy or legal issues, publishers do not pass judgment on individuals. The information is as much as possible provided by the individuals themselves, and the proofs are reviewed and signed by the individuals after selection.

The publishers of these directories are mostly well-established publishing houses with decades of experience in publishing such books. They all emphasize their long history, reliable information, and comprehensive coverage of individuals. Of course, these publishers, to maintain their reputation (and market), indeed strive for accurate and timely content, and are cautious in selecting individuals, not wanting to include mediocre ones. Therefore, although it is not called a Directory of Notable Individuals, in reality, it does have a certain level of prestige to be included. However, regardless, the selection of individuals is made by the editors of the publishing house and is not endorsed by any authority or selected by any committee. If some of our scholars are not included for some reason, it does not mean their achievements are lesser than those included. It is not as if being included makes one's value ten times greater.

It is undeniable that some Western directories have biases. For example, the Directory of the Second World War edited by the British includes only Western and Japanese commanders. The book features Hitler, Roosevelt, and Churchill with two-page or full-page large photographs, while Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Chiang Kai-shek, and Soong Mei-ling each have a small section. There is a small photo of Mao Zedong, a small photo of Chiang Kai-shek with Hurley and Chennault, a small photo of the Cairo Conference, all of which are only half the size of the photo of Goebbels' wife in the book. This is obviously a reflection of British-style white supremacy for a great nation that fought an eight-year war of resistance and lost millions of people.

In the future, such reference books abroad will include more introductions to our country's individuals, and we will also publish similar reference books. From various perspectives, it is more appropriate to translate it as a Directory of Names. Over the decades, we have unknowingly developed a habit of exaggeration. One moment it's the Great Leap Forward, claiming to be on the verge of communism, the next moment it's everyone becoming a businessman, with teachers selling ice cream. After a round of turmoil, we adjust and rectify. The biographical dictionary naturally becomes a Directory of Notable Individuals. It is better to be practical and not bestow so many titles. With human relationships, banquets, and gifts, there will be many more issues regarding who is a notable individual and who is not. It is better to treat it as a dictionary of names or a biographical dictionary. For the selected individuals, only facts should be introduced, without evaluating the individuals, and certainly without any boasting. Many things are not yet settled even after one's death, let alone before death?

### 名人录乎，人名录乎？

    名人录乎，人名录乎？
    简直
    偶或读到某同胞名列某国名人录的报道，本人忝为炎黄子孙，也觉得与有荣焉。仔细一问，是列入了某本Who’swho。按字面译，可以译为“人名录”，实则是一种人名辞典。
    这种人名录在经济和文化发达的国家出版的种类很多。有综合性的，如美国人名录，法国人名录；有分类型的，如国际作家人名录，国际教育界人名录，经济和企业界人名录等等。也有些是以组织为对象的，如欧洲社团及其他组织名录，欧洲商业、企业名录等。
    以上这些人名录或名录，只列活着的人或现存的组织。
    另有一类是专门针对某个特定历史时期的。如第一次世界大战人名录，第二次世界大战人名录……甚至还有两种世界地图制作者人名录，把几百年来绘制和印刷地图的人一一列入。
    还有一类明显的是做为政治、经济情报使用的。如西德编印的苏联人名录（1984），收集了苏联各界人士，还包括有退休的、开除的、免职和降职的人员名单。
    关于中国的，有香港1966年出版的共产党中国人名录。收集了八届中委，各省市党委，国防委员会，政协和军事各部门的名单。这些在当时都是带有研究“对立面”性质的。
    这些人名录都是一种辞典性质的工具书。只提供事实，不加评论。如国际人名录中“基辛格”一条也只有三百余字，包括生辰年月，学历，父母，子女，曾在何处任何职，参加过什么社团，出过什么书。一般的说，人名录正反人物都有，为避免引起争议或涉及法律问题，出版社决不臧否人物。资料尽可能请本人填写，选定后清样再由本人核对签字。
    人名录的出版商大多是出版这类书籍已有几十年历史的老牌出版社，无不宣传其历史悠久、资料可靠、人物详全。当然，这些出版商为了保持其信誉（和市场），也确实力求内容确切、及时，选择人物也不愿滥竽充数。因此虽说它不叫名人录，实际也是有点名气的，才能列入。但无论如何，人选是由出版商的编辑收集选编的，并非由什么权威审定或由什么委员会评选，如果我们有些名家由于什么原因未列入，也不等于其成就比列入的洋人小。并非一登龙门，身价十倍。
    不可否认，西方某些人名录免不了带有偏见。如英国人编辑的第二次世界大战人名录，选择的都是西方和日本的将领。书中希特勒、罗斯福、邱吉尔都有通两页或全页的大照片多幅，而书中只有毛泽东、朱德、蒋介石、宋美龄各一小段。附有毛泽东小照一张，蒋介石和赫尔利、陈纳德合影各一小张，开罗会议一小张，都只有该书中戈培尔老婆那张照片的一半大小。这对于打了八年反侵略战争，死了几千万人的伟大国家来说，显然是带有英国式的白人偏见的。
    今后国外这种工具书中对我国人士的介绍会多起来，我们也会出版类似的工具书。从各种角度考虑，应译为人名录较妥。几十年来，我们不知不觉养成一种浮夸的习惯。一会儿大跃进，说是快进入共产主义了，一会儿全民皆商，老师也去卖冰棍。折腾一番，再调整、整顿。人名辞典到我们这儿就自然而然的变成名人录。不如实实在在，别封那么多名人。再加上人情关系，请客送礼，谁是名人，谁不是名人，会多出许多事情来。还是作为辞典性质的人名录或人名辞典或人物志为好。对入选人士只介绍事实，不要评价人物，更不要有任何吹嘘。许多事情，盖棺还不一定论定呢，何况未盖棺乎？
