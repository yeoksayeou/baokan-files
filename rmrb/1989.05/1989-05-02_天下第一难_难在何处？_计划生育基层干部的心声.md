**Editor's Note:** Family planning work is known as the "hardest task in the world." Let's take a look at how these comrades who are engaged in this "hardest task in the world" work. They are a group of people who work tirelessly for the benefit of the entire nation. Society should respect them, the masses should understand them, leaders should care for them, and the law should protect them.

Population, like a "tightening spell," has constrained the development of China's social economy. Family planning, as a fundamental national policy, has no other choice.

However, in reality, family planning is equated with the "hardest task in the world."

Where exactly are the difficulties? Perhaps those who dare to "defy the world" and work as grassroots family planning cadres have the most to say on this matter.

In early spring, in Sichuan Province, which has the largest population in China, reporters had contact and conversations with many grassroots family planning cadres.

**A Heart Full of Bitterness—The Least Welcome Cadres**

Bazhong County has consecutively won the banner of "National Advanced County in Family Planning" for several years, but some grassroots family planning cadres in this county are full of bitterness when they talk about this matter.

Liu Zhao Hua, a family planning cadre from Shuangfeng Township, is a sturdy young man. He told the reporter about an incident that happened not long ago. That day, he went to a household that was forcibly having a second child to do some work, planning to take the pregnant woman for an abortion. However, as soon as they stepped out of the door, they were hugged by the man of the house, who would not let them go. After a struggle, the man bit Liu's leg hard.

At this point, Liu Zhao Hua couldn't help but roll up his pants, revealing a long, deep scar on his calf.

The reporter heard of similar incidents that made the family planning cadres heartbroken.

The head of the Planning Commission of Nandou County went to a township to participate in the election of people's representatives. The county People's Congress officials introduced to the crowd: "This is the head of the Planning Commission." The crowd immediately began to murmur: "This person is always telling us not to have children, we won't vote for him." Fortunately, the People's Congress official woke up quickly and added: "This is the head of the steel and cement department, not the head of family planning." Thus, the election went smoothly. This incident was once widely circulated as a joke in the local area.

The reporter once asked some farmers: "If you were to choose the least welcome grassroots cadre, who would you choose?" They almost didn't think and blurted out: "Those who do family planning."

To the farmers' choice, the head of the Family Planning Commission of Nanjiang County, Jiang Zhi Xiu, said it was not surprising. She said that at present, in rural areas, the traditional concepts of "filial piety has three aspects, the most important being to have a son" and "the more children, the more blessings" are still deeply rooted. In rural areas, especially in mountainous areas, the mode of production is still relatively backward, and the labor intensity is large. Farmers feel that the more labor force, the better. As the executors of the national family planning policy, family planning cadres become the objects of farmers' dissatisfaction.

To change the fixed fertility concepts that Chinese farmers have formed over thousands of years is not something that can be achieved in a short time, but reality requires us to control the population as soon as possible. This is undoubtedly a major difficulty facing family planning workers.

**Calling for Understanding—Writing a Resignation Letter with Tears**

In a county deep in the Daba Mountains, a family planning cadre who had worked for many years declined the opportunity to be promoted to the head of the Family Planning Commission multiple times, despite being fully qualified for the position.

Throughout the interviews, the reporter found that almost all the family planning cadres, after discussing the importance and urgency of family planning work, expressed the hope of being transferred from the family planning position.

Not only the family planning cadres, but even county-level leaders are reluctant to take charge of family planning work. Why is there a phenomenon of "everyone says it's important, but everyone wants to avoid it"? Is it just because they are afraid of the insults, entanglements, and even beatings from the masses?

From a resignation letter written by a township family planning specialist to his superiors, we might find the root of the conflict. He wrote:

"Although I work hard for 365 days a year, what does it bring me? Now I am in a situation where I am criticized from all sides. Outside, I am criticized by the masses; when I go home, I am criticized by my wife and children. My wife complains that I am so tired that she is scolded outside and ridiculed. My children also say that they are unlucky to follow me. My eldest son is almost 20 years old, but he cannot find a job. Why? Because his father is a family planning worker. Relatives and friends also look down on me. Former good friends now avoid me, saying I can do anything but engage in the work of cutting off descendants. Some leaders also dislike me, saying I am too serious and do not show mercy..."

"The letter was written with tears, and I also read it with tears," said the head of the Family Planning Commission of Nandou County, Yuan. He said: Family planning cadres feel that they cannot hold their heads high in public, and they are even ashamed to say their identity when traveling to other places. We do not ask others to sing our praises, but we hope that through our hard work, we can gain at least some respect from society, and hope that our work can be recognized by society. In this way, even if we are tired and bitter, we will be content.

The head of the Family Planning Commission's words expressed the voices of the broad family planning cadres, calling for trust, fairness, understanding, and care.

**The Disappointment of the "Soloist"—Obstacles from All Sides**

In a county in northern Sichuan.

Last year, a female teacher in a village was pregnant with her third child. At first, the teacher ignored the family planning cadre's persistent advice, but later she finally agreed not to give birth and wrote a guarantee: "If the child is born, I am willing to be dismissed from public office." However, soon after, news that made the family planning cadres disappointed came: the child was still born.

When the family planning cadres, who were extremely angry, were about to take serious action against the teacher, they encountered obstacles from all sides. In the end, the matter was escalated to the county level, and the county government had to make the final decision. The result of the vote by the seven county leaders was 4:3, not in favor of dismissal.

During the interviews, the reporter heard from many family planning cadres that they often find themselves in such an embarrassing situation in their work: persuasion and education, the over-birth households do not listen; if they are to be punished, they often cannot be punished; if they are not punished, it will affect a large area.

What made the family planning cadres even more disappointed was that they lacked the basic working conditions and the necessary working environment.

When the Family Planning Commission of Qianjiang was established, it had only 1,600 yuan in startup funds, resulting in no place to hang the sign, no place to put the seal, and no place to live.

In Chengguan Town of Wangcang County, the family planning department could not carry out urgent work due to the failure to secure 500 yuan in activity funds.

"We now owe the health department more than 100 million yuan in surgical fees. I am almost the 'leader of the beggars,'" said Wang Wenyu, the head of the Family Planning Commission of Guangyuan City, self-deprecatingly.

A regional family planning commission head told the reporter that in their area, some places have turned the family planning department into a "reception center" for the old, weak, sick, and disabled!

A county's family planning commission head talked about his experience with indignation: "I have repeatedly proactively reported my work to the relevant county leaders, but every time I was turned away by the cold 'no time' three words."

In some counties, the court refuses to accept any cases related to family planning.

Many family planning cadres pointed out that family planning work is like a symphony, and it is absolutely not possible for the family planning department to perform alone. The reason why the work is difficult to carry out is that the population consciousness and the concept of per capita have not taken root in the minds of cadres, especially leading cadres. Many departments still hold the attitude of "it's none of my business, let's hang it up high."

They call for: more support and assistance from all sectors of society for family planning, more, and even more!

　　“天下第一难”难在何处？
     ——计划生育基层干部的心声
    新华社记者  储学军  徐波
    编者按：计划生育工作，号称“天下第一难”。那么，看看这些从事“天下第一难”工作的同志们是怎样工作的吧！这是一批为了全民族的利益而任劳任怨的人们。社会应当尊重他们，群众应当理解他们，领导应当关心他们，法律应当保护他们。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    人口，似一道“紧箍咒”，束缚住了我国社会经济发展的步伐。计划生育作为基本国策，已经别无选择。
    但是，在现实社会中，计划生育却与“天下第一难”划上了等号。
    难点究竟在哪里？想来，对这一问题最有发言权的，莫过于那些敢“冒天下之大不韪”的计划生育基层干部了。
    初春时节，在中国人口最多的四川省，记者与许多基层计生干部进行了接触和交谈。
            满腹辛酸——“最不受欢迎的干部”
    巴中县已连续几年荣获全国计划生育先进县的锦旗，可这个县的一些基层计生干部谈及此事却满腹辛酸。
    刘兆华，双凤乡的计生干部，十分敦实的一个小伙子，向记者讲述了不久前他经历的一件事。那天，他来到一个强行怀二胎的农户家做工作，准备领孕妇去引产，可刚出门，就被那家的男人抱住腿不让走，一阵纠缠后，那人竟张嘴向他腿上狠狠咬去。
    说到这里，刘兆华情不自禁地挽起裤子，只见他小腿上一道又长又深的伤疤赫然入目。
    类似这类令计生干部们痛心的事，记者还听到不少。
    南部县计划委员会主任到某乡去参加人民代表选举，县人大的同志向群众介绍：这是县计委主任。台下立即议论纷纷：这人一天到晚就知道不准我们生娃娃，不选他。幸亏人大那位同志醒悟得快，连忙补了一句：这是管钢材、管水泥的主任，不是管计划生育的主任。于是选举顺利通过。这事，在当地曾一时传为笑谈。
    记者曾向一些农民问道：如果让你选最不受欢迎的基层干部，你们选谁？他们几乎想也没想就脱口而出：搞计划生育的。
    对农民的这一选择，南江县计生委主任江治秀认为并不奇怪。她说，目前在农村，“不孝有三，无后为大”、“多子多福”等传统生育观念仍根深蒂固。农村特别是山区，生产方式仍比较落后，劳动强度较大，农民觉得劳动力多多益善。作为国家计划生育政策的执行者，计生干部便成为农民发泄不满的对象。
    要改变我国农民几千年来形成的固有生育观念，那不是短时间所能奏效的，而现实又要求我们必须尽快把人口控制下来，这无疑是横亘在计划生育工作者面前的一道大难题。
    　　　　呼唤理解——含泪写成辞职信
    在大巴山区腹地的某县，一位工作多年的计生干部，在上级多次准备提拔他为县计生委主任时，他都婉言推诿了。尽管以他的水平、能力是足以胜任的。
    在一路采访中，记者所遇到的计生干部几乎无一不是在谈论了一番计划生育工作的重要性和紧迫性之后，又表示希望能调离计划生育工作岗位。
    不仅计生干部如此，就连县级领导也没几个愿意分管计划生育工作。为什么会出现“人人皆说重要，个个都想溜边”的现象呢？仅仅是怕群众不理解的辱骂、纠缠甚至殴打吗？
    从一位乡计生专干写给上级的辞职信中，我们也许能发现矛盾的症结。他写道：
    “尽管我一年３６５天辛苦工作，可这又给我带来了什么呢？现在我正处于四面受气的境地。在外面，受群众的气；回到家里又受老婆孩子的气。老婆怨我累得她在外面挨白眼，遭奚落。孩子们也说跟着我背时，我的大儿子快２０岁了，却找不到工作，别说进乡镇企业，就是打零工也轮不到他。为什么？因为他的父亲是搞计划生育工作的。亲戚朋友也看不起我，以前很好的朋友现在也疏远了，说我干啥不行，偏偏干断子绝孙的事。一些领导也看我不顺眼，说我办事太认真，不留情面……”
    “信是含泪写的，我也是含泪看的”，南部县计生委袁主任显得很激动，他说：计生干部深感在人前抬不起头，到外地出差甚至羞于说出自己的身份。我们也并不企求别人对我们大唱赞歌，只是希望能通过自己的辛劳，求得社会起码的尊重，希望自己的工作能得到社会的承认。这样，我们再苦再累心也甘了。
    袁主任的这一席话，道出了广大计生干部们呼唤信任、公正、理解和关心的心声。
    　　　　“独奏”者的失望——四处受阻
    川北某县。
    去年，一位乡村女教师怀上第三胎。开始时，这位教师对计生干部的苦口婆心置若罔闻，后来终于开了口，同意不生，并写下保证书：如生下来，甘受开除公职处分。可事隔不久，即传来令计生干部们沮丧的消息：孩子还是生下来了。
    当气极了的计生干部们准备对那位教师进行严肃处理时，却又遇到了来自各方面的阻力。最后事情一直捅到县上，不得不由县长办公会作出最后裁决。７位正副县长投票表决结果：４∶３，不同意开除公职。
    在采访中，记者听到不少计生干部反映，他们在工作中经常陷入这样的尴尬境地：说服教育，超生户听不进去；处理吧，又常常处理不下去；不处理吧，则将影响一大片。
    更让计生干部失望的是，他们缺乏起码的工作条件和应有的工作环境。
    黔江地区计生委成立时，只有１６００元开办费，结果牌子没处挂，公章没处放，人也没处住。
    旺苍县城关镇，计生部门因５００元活动费落实不了，致使急需开展的工作搁浅。
    “我们现在已欠卫生部门１００多万元手术费，我都快成‘丐帮帮主’了，”广元市计生委主任王文育自嘲道。
    一位地区计生委主任告诉记者，他们那里有的地方，计生部门成了老弱病差干部的“收容队”！
    一个县的计生委主任谈起自己的遭遇就愤愤然：“我多次主动找县上有关领导汇报工作，可每次都被冷冰冰的‘没时间’三个字拒之门外。”
    还有的县，法院只要听说是计划生育方面的案子都不愿受理。
    许多计生干部指出，计划生育工作如同一首交响乐，单靠计生部门一家独奏绝对不行。而现在工作之所以难以开展，关键在于人口意识和人均观念在干部、特别是领导干部头脑中还没生根，很多部门对计划生育工作还抱着“事不关己，高高挂起”的态度。
    他们呼唤：社会各方对计划生育的支持和帮助，多些，再多些！
