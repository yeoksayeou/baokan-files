    The photograph was taken by Li Ping in front of the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall in Guangzhou. It shows a fortune teller conducting his business in public. This scene is quite common in Guangzhou. Fortune tellers, geomancers, and those who practice other forms of superstition often gather in crowded places, attracting a large number of people. Some of them even set up shops, openly engaging in activities that spread superstition and disrupt social order.

    The presence of these fortune tellers and geomancers not only affects the image of the city but also misleads the public, especially the younger generation. It is high time that relevant departments take effective measures to clean up these activities and maintain a healthy and orderly social environment.

    The government should strengthen its supervision and management of public spaces. Law enforcement agencies should crack down on illegal activities and punish those who engage in superstition and fraud. At the same time, education departments should enhance public awareness about scientific knowledge and rational thinking, helping people to distinguish between science and superstition.

    By taking these steps, we can create a cleaner, more orderly, and scientifically advanced city, benefiting the people and promoting social progress.
