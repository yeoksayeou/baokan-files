The CPSU Central Committee held a plenary session in Moscow today, proposing that the forthcoming Congress of People's Deputies elect CPSU Central Committee General Secretary Gorbachev as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

According to TASS, the plenary session discussed issues related to the convening of the Congress of People's Deputies. Gorbachev delivered a report at the meeting. Soviet Premier Ryzhkov, First Deputy Chairman of the State Construction Committee Yeltsin, and 34 other Central Committee members spoke at the session. The plenary session adopted relevant resolutions on the discussed issues. The content of the report and resolutions were not disclosed today.

The first Congress of People's Deputies in Soviet history is scheduled to open in Moscow on May 25. Delegates from all over the country, totaling 2,250, have arrived.

The report also mentioned that a statement by CPSU Central Committee Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Ligachov was read at the plenary session. The Soviet Prosecutor's Office is investigating the issues raised in Ligachov's statement. It is known that Soviet investigator Godlyan had accused Ligachov of bribery during his campaign for the Congress of People's Deputies, which Ligachov has strongly denied. It is estimated that Ligachov's statement is related to this matter.

　　苏共中央全会建议人代大会选举戈氏为最高苏维埃主席
    新华社莫斯科５月２２日电  苏共中央今天在莫斯科举行全会，建议即将召开的苏联人民代表大会选举苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫为苏联最高苏维埃主席。
    据塔斯社报道，这次全会讨论了与举行人民代表大会有关的问题。戈尔巴乔夫在会上作了报告。苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫、国家建委第一副主席叶利钦等３４名中央委员在会上发了言。全会就所讨论的问题通过了相应的决议。此间今天没有公布报告和决议的内容。
    苏联历史上第一次人民代表大会将于本月２５日在莫斯科开幕。来自全国各地的２２５０名代表已陆续报到。
    报道说，在全会上还宣读了苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记利加乔夫的一项声明，苏联检察院正在对利加乔夫声明中提出的问题进行调查。据悉，苏联侦查员戈德良在竞选人民代表活动时曾指控利加乔夫有受贿行为，利加乔夫对此已断然否认。估计利加乔夫的声明与此事有关。
