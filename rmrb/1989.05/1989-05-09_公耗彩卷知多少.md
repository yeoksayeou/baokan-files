Title: How Much Public Funds Are Spent on Color Film?

A friend who works in a cultural center specializing in photography told me: Whenever some unit or organization holds a meeting or an activity, they always call in a photographer to take pictures, snapping away with a "click" here and a "click" there. Moreover, they don't use domestic color film; they insist on buying foreign brands like "Kodak" and "Fuji." Is this "adding flowers to brocade" behavior too far removed from our national conditions?

As the saying goes, "One click, one yuan spent; one roll, thirty-six yuan gone." In a county with hundreds of units, the public funds spent on color film alone in a year must amount to at least two or three hundred rolls. Adding the developing costs, it's sure to exceed ten thousand yuan. If one county is like this, what about a region, a province, or even the entire country in a year?

The central government has repeatedly ordered the reduction of collective consumption and the control of collective purchasing power, but down below, "if the east doesn't shine, the west will." Cameras and lenses, these high-end durable consumer goods, are controlled, but the expenditure on color film and developing fees has surged, with a tendency to compete with each other. The cost of ten rolls of film and their developing fees already far exceeds the price of an ordinary camera. I truly hope that our financial and auditing departments can come up with a solution to stop this trend soon.

　　公耗彩卷知多少
    谙萍
    听一位在文化馆专搞摄影的朋友讲：不少机关单位每当开个什么会或搞个什么活动，总要把摄影师叫去，为他们左一个“卡嚓”，右一个“卡嚓”，而且国产的彩卷不要，买的全是“柯达”、“富士”之类的外国货。这种“锦上添花”的行为，是不是离我国国情相去太远了？
    俗话说：“‘卡嚓’一张，一元花光；‘卡嚓’一卷，三十六元。”一个县，大小机关单位数以百计，一年“卡嚓”掉的公费彩卷，恐怕至少也有二三百卷，加上冲扩的费用，万元关必破无疑了。一个县如此，一个地区、一个省，乃至全国，一年该花掉多少钱呢？
    中央三令五申压缩集团消费，控制社会集团购买力，而下边则“东方不亮西方亮”。相机和镜头等高档耐用消费品控制了，彩卷及冲扩费用却又一轰而起，并大有互相攀比之势。而十个彩卷及其冲扩的费用，已大大超过了一架普通相机的价钱。真希望我们的财政、审计部门早点拿出刹住此风的良方来。
