In early May, the 50-watt satellite ground receiving station built by farmers in Danshui Town, Xixia County, Henan Province, was completed. With this, the county has built a total of 8 satellite ground receiving stations and 16 television relay stations. Now, 70% of the county's population can watch television.

Xixia is a mountainous county where it is difficult to receive and transmit television signals. Since 1979, the county has regarded the development of broadcasting and television in mountainous areas as a fundamental measure to combat poverty and ignorance. The county has mobilized the masses to save money and raise over 10 million yuan to build television facilities.

　　西峡山区７０％农民能看到电视
    本报讯  ５月初，河南省西峡县丹水镇农民集资兴建的５０瓦卫星地面接收站竣工。至此，该县已建成卫星地面接收站８座，电视转播台１６座，全县７０％的人可以看到电视。
    西峡是深山县，电视信号接收难，传递难。１９７９年以来，这个县把办好山区广播电视事业当成治穷治愚的根本措施来抓。发动群众节衣缩食，集资１００多万元用于办电视。
