    World No-Tobacco Day
    Following the designation of April 7, 1988, as the first World No-Tobacco Day, the World Health Organization has designated May 31, 1989, as the second World No-Tobacco Day. This serves as a reminder to people around the world about the dangers of smoking and calls for people to quit smoking.

    The harm caused by smoking has long been a well-known fact in modern society. As early as 1962, the Royal College of Physicians in London published a report stating, "There is fairly reliable evidence to suggest that smoking is the most likely cause of the increasing number of deaths from lung cancer in the world." Scientific research has repeatedly proven that smoking is a major cause of bronchitis, emphysema, lung cancer, heart disease, hypertension, and stroke. Even passive smoking can lead to these health issues. Statistics show that at least 2.5 to 3 million people worldwide die each year from smoking-related diseases. Approximately one-fifth of the world's children are exposed to secondhand smoke, which affects their growth and delays intellectual development.

    Unfortunately, despite the severe harm caused by smoking, the number of smokers worldwide is not only large but also continues to grow. The World Health Organization reports that in developed countries, one-third of the population over 15 years old smokes; in developing countries, half of the men and one-tenth of the women in the same age group smoke. The total number of smokers worldwide is approximately 1.5 billion. Even more regrettably, the number of smokers in the world is increasing at a rate of 2.1% per year, which is even higher than the global population growth rate.

    As people's understanding of the dangers of smoking deepens, the call to quit smoking is growing louder. Many countries are forming strong anti-smoking movements. Following Italy's enactment of the world's first anti-smoking law, nearly 70 countries have now enacted similar laws. Of these, 33 countries are planning to take measures to eliminate smoking by the year 2000, aiming to become smoke-free nations. The global anti-smoking movement is expanding, with 40 million people in the United States, 10 million in the United Kingdom, and 5.5 million in Canada having quit smoking. If people around the world join the fight against smoking, the smoking rate will decrease, and a smoke-free society can be achieved. The key now is to take action.

### 世界无烟日

    世界无烟日
    世界卫生组织继把去年4月7日定为第一个世界无烟日之后，把今年5月31日定为第二个世界无烟日，再一次提醒全世界人民注意吸烟的危害，呼吁人们戒烟。
    吸烟危害健康早已成为现代社会生活的基本常识。早在1962年，英国伦敦皇家医学院发表报告指出，“有相当可靠的证据表明，吸烟是最可能使世界上肺癌致死的人数日益增多的主要原因”。科学反复证明，吸烟是支气管炎、肺气肿、肺癌、心脏病、高血压、中风等疾患的重大诱因之一，即使是被动吸烟，也难逃厄运。统计数据表明，全世界每年至少有250万到300万人因吸烟致病而死亡。全世界约有1／5的儿童淹没在烟雾之中，成长受到影响，智力发育迟缓。
    遗憾的是，尽管吸烟危害极大，但全世界烟民人数不仅基数庞大，而且每天都在增加。世界卫生组织统计，在经济发达国家，15岁以上人口中有1／3的人吸烟；在发展中国家的同样年龄组中，1／2的男性和1／10的女性吸烟。全世界吸烟人数约有15亿之多。更可悲的是，目前世界的吸烟大军每年仍以2.1％的速度增长，这甚至比世界人口的增长率还高。
    随着人们对吸烟危害的认识越来越深刻，反对吸烟的呼声日益高涨；许多国家正在形成强大的戒烟运动。继意大利制定了世界上第一部戒烟法之后，目前已有近70个国家制定了相应的法律，其中有33个国家准备采取措施，争取到2000年消除吸烟现象，成为无烟国家。全世界的戒烟队伍正在不断扩大，美国的戒烟者已达4000万，英国为1000万，加拿大550万。如果全世界人们都起来参加反吸烟斗争，吸烟率就会下降，“无烟社会”就可以实现，现在的关键是行动起来。
