In recent years, research in human genome engineering within the field of genetic engineering has increasingly drawn the attention of some developed countries.

People know that genes are the fundamental components of heredity. Not only do they govern human growth and aging, but they are also closely related to many difficult diseases and hereditary conditions, such as cancer. Biologists have found that human genetic information is located in cells and is composed of 23 pairs of chromosomes. The information units in the chromosomes number more than three billion, but only 2.3% of these have been deciphered by humans. Among all the genetic information in the human body, approximately 50,000 to 100,000 genes control human growth, development, reproduction, lifespan, as well as determining hair color, physical characteristics, and living habits. These genes constitute the human genome. Genome engineering involves replicating the position of each gene in the chromosomes to determine the sequence of genetic codes. In this process, scientists may discover various regular or irregular gene positions and genetic codes, thereby identifying genes with hereditary traits. This will create favorable conditions for the development of biological products and the conquest of various difficult diseases.

The United States was the first country to propose research in human genome engineering. It plans to spend fifteen years and invest three billion dollars to complete this project. The period from 1987 to 1992 is the first phase of this project. The goal of the first phase is to replicate the functional map of human genetic information. After achieving the goals of the first phase, the next phase of research will begin. To accelerate the progress of human genome engineering, the United States appointed Nobel Prize winner and co-discoverer of the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, James Watson, as the director of this project in October 1988. The project is under the leadership of the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy.

Human genome engineering will have a profound impact on the fundamental research of biology. Therefore, Japan, the Soviet Union, and various Western European countries do not want the United States to monopolize this field and have formulated their own "human genome engineering" plans. Soviet scientist Bayev recently stated, "The location and sequencing of human genes are a common wealth of humanity, and the data obtained should not become the private property of a single country or individual enterprises."

Former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro proposed the "New Domain of Human Research Plan" at the 1986 Western Seven Summit. Many Japanese scientists have suggested to the Japanese government that "human genome engineering" should be the core of this plan. According to Japanese newspapers, Japan has begun two medium-scale projects. One is to sequence the order of yeast chromosome 7. The other is to locate and sequence human chromosome 21. Their goal is to sequence one million base pairs by 1990.

The Soviet Union has also listed "human genome engineering" as a key research project. They not only aim to locate and sequence human genes but also plan to sequence the genes of mice, yeast, and fruit flies.

Western European countries such as France, Britain, West Germany, and Italy, which have a relatively high level of fundamental research in biology, have also established specialized institutions for "human genome engineering" or allocated special research funds. They will focus on locating and sequencing the X chromosome. To unify the research work of various European countries and avoid duplication with American research, the European Community has begun a research project called "Predictive Medicine."

Human genome engineering is a massive project that cannot be completed by a single country in a short period. It requires mutual support and cooperation among countries. However, each country, based on its own interests, wants to obtain more research results. Therefore, there is intense competition among countries. For this reason, the "International Cooperation on Human Genome Engineering" conference held in Valencia, Spain, last October, did not reach any substantive cooperation agreement.

　　发达国家竞相研究人体基因组
    曲国斌
    近年来，基因工程中人体基因组工程的研究，正日益引起世界上一些发达国家的高度重视。
    人们知道，基因是遗传的基本成份，不仅人的生长和老化，而且诸如癌症等许多疑难病症和遗传病症都与基因密切相关。生物学家们的研究结果表明，人的遗传基因存在于细胞中，由二十三对染色体组成。染色体中遗传基因的信息单位多达三十亿以上，迄今能够被人类揭开的只有百分之二点三。在人体的全部遗传基因中，大约有五万至十万个遗传基因控制着人的生长、发育、繁殖、寿命，以及决定人的头发颜色、外表特征和生活习性。这些基因就是人的基因组。基因组工程就是复制染色体中每个基因的位置，以确定每个基因的遗传密码的排列顺序。在这一过程中，科学家们将有可能发现各种规则或不规则的基因位置和遗传密码，从而找出带有遗传特性的基因，为研制生物制品和征服各种疑难病症创造出有利条件。
    美国是提出人体基因组工程研究最早的国家，它计划用十五年时间投入三十亿美元的巨款来完成这项工程的研究。一九八七至一九九二年为这项工程研究的第一阶段。第一阶段要复制成人体遗传基因功能的图解。待第一阶段目标达到后，将开始后一阶段的研究。为加速人体基因组工程的进展，美国已于一九八八年十月任命诺贝尔奖获得者、脱氧核糖核酸结构发现者之一沃森为这一工程研究的负责人，并把这一工程归属于美国国立科学财团、美国国立卫生研究院和美国能源部领导。
    人体基因组工程对生物学的基础研究，将会产生极为深远的影响。所以，日本、苏联和西欧各国谁都不想让美国对此进行垄断，并纷纷制定自己的“人体基因组工程”计划。苏联科学家巴叶夫不久前发表讲话指出，“对人体基因的定位和排序是人类共同的财富，所获取的数据不应成为一个国家或个别企业的私有财产”。
    日本前首相中曾根康弘在一九八六年的西方七国首脑会议上，提出了“人体新领域研究计划”。日本许多科学家都向日本政府建议，应将“人体基因组工程”列为这一计划的核心。据日本报纸报道，日本已开始两项中间规模计划。一项是排定酵母菌染色体—七的顺序。另一项是对人体染色体—二十一进行定位和测定顺序计划。他们的目标是到一九九○年排定一百万个碱基。
    苏联也将“人体基因组工程”列为一个重点科研课题。他们不仅想对人体基因进行定位和顺序测定，而且还将测定诸如老鼠、酵母菌及果蝇的基因顺序。
    生物学的基础研究具有相当水平的法国、英国、西德和意大利等西欧国家，也都建立有关“人体基因组工程”的专门机构，或为此拨出专门研究款项。他们将集中力量对Ｘ染色体进行定位和排序。为将西欧各国的研究工作统一起来，避免同美国的研究工作相重复，欧洲共同体已开始一项称为“预言性医学”的研究计划。
    人体基因组工程是一个工作量十分巨大的工程，不是一个国家短期内可以完成的，需要各国相互支持与合作。但是，各国又从自己实际利益出发，总想多得到一些研究成果，所以各国间又进行着激烈的竞争。正因为如此，去年十月在西班牙巴伦西亚召开的“人体基因组工程国际合作讨论会”，未达成任何实质性的合作协议。
