	Teachers Hope for Timely Payment of Salaries
	It has been ten days since April began, and more than 200 teachers and staff in Dashadong Township, Gu'an County, Hebei Province, have yet to receive their salaries. During this busy spring planting season, teachers are anxious and spreading the news among themselves: this month's salary has been forcibly treated as a "voluntary" deposit by the township bank and cannot be withdrawn immediately.

	The township education office and the school district leaders have tried various means to resolve the issue, but to no avail. Many teachers have expressed strong dissatisfaction, and some even suggest resigning. A "bomb" that could affect the education of more than 3,000 students is about to explode!

	Just at this critical moment, on April 10, Deputy Secretary of the Gu'an County Committee, Comrade Shen Xiuge, rushed to the scene upon hearing the news. Without saying much, he immediately ordered the payment of salaries! He not only criticized the township bank's error of forcibly withholding teachers' salaries but also pointed out: such incidents must not happen again in the future.

	On April 12, the broad masses of teachers received their April salaries. Fortunately, our county leaders care about the teachers and personally intervened. If they had not intervened, some teachers' families would have fallen into difficulties. Some teachers might even stop teaching, with unimaginable consequences. Now, although the country is facing difficulties, teachers can understand and are willing to share the country's burdens. However, they hope that higher authorities can pay salaries on time and not adopt the simple method of withholding salaries to solve problems.

　　教师盼准时发工资
    进入四月份已经十天了，河北省固安县大沙垡乡二百多名教职工仍未领到工资。在春耕生产的紧张时刻，教师们人心惶惶，互相奔走相告：本月工资被乡银行强行作为“自由”存款处理，且不能当时领取。
    乡文教办公室领导、学区领导多方做工作，终未有结果。不少教师表示强烈不满，还有的主张干脆辞职，一个即将影响到三千多名学生停课的“炸弹”，即将爆炸！
    就在这紧要关头，四月十日固安县委副书记沈秀阁同志闻讯赶到，二话没说：当即发工资！他不仅批评了乡银行这种强行扣压教师工资的错误，还指出：以后不准再出现类似现象。
    四月十二日，广大教师领到了四月份的工资。幸亏我们县里的领导关心教师，亲自过问，如果他不过问，有的教师家生活将陷入困境。有的教师罢课罢教，后果不堪设想。现在国家有困难，教师也能体谅，也愿意分担国家的困难，但求上级部门能准时发工资，而绝不能采取停发工资的简单办法来解决问题。
