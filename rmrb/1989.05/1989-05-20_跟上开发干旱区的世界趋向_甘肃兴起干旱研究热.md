Research on drought in Gansu's scientific and technological circles is gaining increasing attention. Currently, the province is undertaking over 200 key research projects on the development of arid regions nationwide. Experts describe this as a new wave of "drought research fever."

Most of these key research projects are commissioned by national, provincial, and autonomous regional economic leadership departments and governments at the county and city levels. The content covers various aspects such as the basic theory of drought, resource development, ecological balance, environmental protection, meteorological forecasting and reporting, water conservation, industry and agriculture, population control, regional development strategies, economic policies, natural zoning and small-area planning, sandland transformation, and biological breeding techniques. The scope of researchers' activities covers about half of the country's territory in the entire arid and semi-arid regions, with a focus on more than 10 provinces and autonomous regions in the Northwest, North China, Northeast, and Central South. Seven key projects, including the observation experiment of the interaction between land and air in the Hexi Corridor and the Heihe region, the changes in hydrological conditions of Qinghai Lake, and the water balance in sandy areas, have attracted the attention and praise of foreign experts and scholars.

Experts have analyzed the reasons for the surge in drought research: First, with the rise of agriculture, scientific research investments have tilted towards the development of arid regions, stimulating the enthusiasm of scientific and technological personnel to conduct drought research. Second, scientists have found that with the rapid increase in the world's population, the carrying capacity of humid regions is becoming smaller, while the vast and sparsely populated arid regions have great potential for agricultural production development. The development of arid regions is a global trend. Additionally, arid and semi-arid areas account for about half of the total land area. Coastal agriculture is gradually developing towards three-dimensional and high-efficiency.

　　跟上开发干旱区的世界趋向
    甘肃兴起干旱研究热
    新华社兰州５月２０日电  （记者王昌）对干旱的研究在甘肃省科技界正越来越得到重视。目前这个省承担的全国干旱开发重点研究课题，已经达到２００多项。人们评价这是一股新的“干旱研究热”。
    这些重点研究课题，多数是国家、省、自治区及地、市有关经济领导部门和政府委托进行的。内容涉及干旱基础理论、资源开发、生态平衡、环境保护、气象预测预报、节水、工农业、人口控制、区域开发战略、经济政策、自然区划与小区域规划、沙地改造、用生物技术育种等各个方面。研究人员的活动范围，占国土一半左右的整个干旱半干旱区，工作重点在西北、华北、东北、中南的１０多个省区。河西走廊黑河地区地气相互作用的观测试验、青海湖水文条件的变化、沙地水分平衡等七项重点课题，已受到国外专家、学者的重视和赞赏。
    专家分析了干旱研究热的原因：首先，随着农业的升温，科研投资向干旱区开发倾斜，激发了科技人员进行干旱研究的积极性。其次，科学家们发现，随着世界人口的急剧增加，湿润区的承载力越来越小，而地广人稀的干旱区却存在着发展农业生产的巨大潜力，开发干旱区是世界范围的总趋向。另外，干旱半干旱面积占到国土总面积一半左右。沿海农业逐渐向立体化、高效益发展。
