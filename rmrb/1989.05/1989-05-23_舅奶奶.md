Auntie is the woman who married my uncle before liberation. Back then, it was customary not to meet before marriage. It was only after the wedding that my uncle found out that Auntie was blind. According to my father, my uncle once tested Auntie on their wedding night.

	“What color are black beans?”
	“Black beans are black.”
	“Yellow beans?”
	“Yellow beans are yellow.”
	“String beans?”
	“String beans are stringy.”

My uncle lost all hope at once. But since the marriage had already taken place and the rice was already cooked, my uncle had no choice but to make the best of it. During the Great Leap Forward, due to a bumper harvest, the yield per acre reached tens of thousands of pounds. My uncle was so full that his belly touched his spine, and he died an untimely death. Since then, Auntie has been a five-guarantee household in the production team.

Auntie is now nearly 70 years old. Although she has always refused to admit that she is blind, people do not ignore this fact and always treat her as if she were blind.

This happened a few years ago.

One summer, after a heavy rain, the weather suddenly cleared up, and the farmers all came out to look at the rainbow. Auntie loves to join in the fun, so she slowly made her way to the street. As she was walking, a man behind her said, “Sister, there's a puddle ahead.” Auntie said, “Nonsense, I've already seen it…”

Before the “ed” sound of “seen” could fall, “splash!” Auntie stepped into the puddle by the side of the street. Although people rescued her quickly, she still drank a few mouthfuls of dirty water.

Later, well-meaning people helped her a few times, but she always said they were meddling in her affairs for no reason and that she had already seen it. After that, no one dared to bother her anymore.

From the time I can remember, Auntie has fallen into the sweet potato pit twice, and once she broke a rib. Other minor incidents like bumping into trees during the day, hitting her face against a wall, or falling over small things are too numerous to count.

Auntie also has a hobby. In winter, when it gets dark early, and the village didn't have electricity, she loved to light an oil lamp and did so earlier than anyone else. After dinner, the farmers had nothing to do and couldn't sleep, so the neighbors would go to Auntie's house to enjoy the free light. The first thing people would say when entering her house was, “Hey, Auntie, your lamp is really bright today!”

Auntie would then be pleased and say, “I just added some oil.”

People would chat for a while, and Auntie would enjoy the company. When they got tired, bored, or cold, they would leave, and Auntie would then blow out the lamp, grope her way around, and go to sleep. She once started a fire because of her love for lighting lamps, but fortunately, it didn't cause a big loss.

From the time I started college to when I began working, I rarely visited Auntie. But according to people from my hometown, Auntie is very resilient. Although she has suffered a lot these years, her body is still strong. It's just that in recent years, the village has had electricity, and at night, Auntie has to grope her way to other people's houses to see the light. This has one advantage: she no longer lights lamps, so she hasn't started any more fires. Her temper, however, is still the same as before. I feel a bit sad, I don't know if Auntie is too clever or too foolish!

　　舅奶奶
    梁欐
    舅奶奶是解放前嫁给舅爷爷的。那时候，结婚前不兴见面，待到结了婚，舅爷爷才知道舅奶奶是个瞎子。据父亲说，舅爷爷曾在新婚之夜对舅奶奶进行过考试。
    “你说黑豆是啥子颜色？”
    “黑豆黑黑的。”
    “黄豆？”
    “黄豆黄黄的。”
    “豇豆？”
    “豇豆豇豇的。”
    舅爷爷一下完全失去了希望。但木已成舟，生米煮成了熟饭，舅爷爷也只好委屈求全了。大跃进那阵子，由于生产大丰收，亩产几万斤，舅爷爷撑得肚皮沾住了脊梁骨，死于非命。舅奶奶从那时便成了队上的五保户。
    舅奶奶现在已近７０岁，虽然一直不承认自己看不见，但人们却不肯忽视这个事实，始终当瞎子待她。
    这是前些年的事了。
    夏天，刚下过大雨，天气忽又晴朗，庄稼人都从家里跑出来看彩虹。舅奶奶爱凑个热闹，也一步步挪到街上去。她正走着，身后忽一男人说：“大嫂，前面有水坑。”舅奶奶说：“屁话，早看见了……”
    那“了”字还没落音儿，“?嗵”一声，舅奶奶就一脚踏空，倒在街边的水坑里。尽管人们救得快，她还是喝了几口脏水。
    再往后，好心人帮过她几次，她都说别人是咸吃萝卜淡操心，早看见了。以后，就没谁再敢去碰她的钉子了。
    从我记事的时候起，舅奶奶掉进地瓜窖两次，其中一次摔断了一根肋骨。其他如大白天头撞树，脸碰墙，摔个小小的跟斗等磕磕碰碰的小事就不计其数了。
    舅奶奶还有一个爱好，冬天天黑下来的早，村里没扯电灯的时候，她爱点油灯，并且比谁家都点得早。庄稼人吃罢晚饭没有事，睡不着，邻居们便到舅奶奶屋里去看不花钱的灯明儿。人们进她屋的第一句话便是：“嘿呀，大娘，您的灯今天真亮！”
    舅奶奶便乐一乐：“刚添的油。”
    人们神聊一阵子大天，舅奶奶便从中取个乐儿。聊困了，乏了，冷了，人走净了，舅奶奶便寂寞地吹灭灯，摸摸索索地睡觉了。也曾经因为她好点个灯儿，失过几回火，庆幸没造成大损失。
    从上大学到参加工作这几年，很少去看望舅奶奶了。但据家乡人说，舅奶奶命硬得很，这些年虽遭了不少罪，身子骨却结实着呢。只是这几年乡里扯了电灯，一到晚上，舅奶奶只好摸索到别人家里去看明儿了。这也有一个好处，她不点灯了，便没再失过火。就是那脾气和从前没两样儿。我心里有些发酸，我不知道舅奶奶是聪明过头了，还是糊涂过头了！
