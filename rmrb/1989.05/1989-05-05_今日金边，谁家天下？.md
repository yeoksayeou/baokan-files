In the thatched huts on the southern slopes of Phnom Voar, a group of refugees who had just escaped from Phnom Penh revealed to the Xinhua News Agency reporters that in Phnom Penh, Vietnamese people make up 60% of the entire population. The wealthy are mostly Vietnamese, while the poor are mostly Khmer. Cambodians need Vietnamese approval to leave the city. Who really controls Phnom Penh?

Two groups of people accepted interviews from the reporters. One group consisted of five individuals who escaped from Phnom Penh on March 24, belonging to four different families. Dr. Aisok, the head of the external surgery department at the former Khet Thmey Hospital in Phnom Penh, was the leader of this group of refugees. Aisok said that the residents of Phnom Penh are increasingly feeling like second-class citizens. Various administrative offices, hospitals, and schools in Phnom Penh all have Vietnamese advisors. In bustling commercial areas like the New Market, only state-run stores in Phnom Penh and Vietnamese stores are allowed to operate, and Khmer people are not permitted to do business. If the Vietnamese military authorities like a Cambodian's private residence, they must move out without any conditions. Cambodians do not have the freedom to travel; if they want to go to other provinces or cities, they must first request permission from the Vietnamese advisors and obtain a travel permit. The rich in Phnom Penh are Vietnamese, and the poor are Khmer. Those who pull rickshaws, porters, and laborers are all Khmer. Most of the beggars on the streets are disabled soldiers of the Heng Samrin regime and injured workers who were sent to the border to build fortifications. If they rely solely on the meager compensation from the authorities, they cannot sustain their lives. She said that on the surface, the number of Vietnamese soldiers in Phnom Penh is decreasing, but the number of Vietnamese officials in civilian clothes in various industries is increasing. Every department and enterprise has Vietnamese advisors. In the hospital where he used to work, there were 10 Vietnamese doctors with the rank of colonel, and Khmer people were not allowed to be the chief surgeons. Pola, a former logistics staff member of the Phnom Penh Police Department, said that the residents of Phnom Penh greatly dislike the Vietnamese; they dare not speak out. Every time the Vietnamese hold a "partial withdrawal" ceremony, the authorities force the residents to go out and cheer. Those who refuse will be labeled as "opposing Cambodian-Vietnamese unity" and sent to participate in "political study" and "physical labor," or even be imprisoned.

Pola revealed that the Phnom Penh police often abuse their authority for personal gain. Jin, who has long been involved in drug smuggling, recently told us: "Last year, some Vietnamese soldiers I knew withdrew. At that time, I believed it. However, recently, I found some of them back in some towns. However, they were not in uniform and brought their families. The other day, I suddenly saw a familiar face in a bakery in Phnom Penh. Previously, he was an officer at a Vietnamese military base and had accepted my bribes. He also recognized me and greeted me warmly." Jin said, "I don't understand politics, but I don't believe that the Vietnamese have truly left Phnom Penh and Cambodia."

### 今日金边，谁家天下？

　　今日金边，谁家天下？
    据新华社民柬扁担山５月３日电  （记者杨木、蔡锡梅）在扁担山南麓茅棚里，刚从金边逃出的一群难民向新华社记者组透露，在金边城里，越南人占全部人口６０％。富的都是越南人，穷人多属高棉人。柬埔寨人出城要经越南人批准。金边，究竟是谁的天下？
    接受记者采访的有两批人。一批是今年３月２４日刚从金边逃出来的５个人，分属４个家庭。原金边市盖笃密利医院外科医生艾素基是这批难民的领头人。艾素基说，金边居民越来越体会到当二等公民的滋味。金边当局各行政机关、医院、学校都有越南顾问；在金边的新市场等繁华的商业区，只允许金边“国营商店”与越南人商店经营，不准柬埔寨人做买卖；柬埔寨居民的私房，若被越军当局看中，必须无条件迁出；柬埔寨人没有旅行的自由，若要到外省市去，必须事先向越军顾问请假并领取路条。金边的富人是越南人，穷人是高棉人。拉三轮的、搬运工、苦力都是高棉人。沿街行乞者中大多是残废的韩桑林士兵和到边境修工事的伤病民工。他们如果只靠当局的微薄抚恤金，是无法维持生活的。她说，从表面上看，在金边的越南军人日益减少，但到各行业穿便服的越南官兵却日益增多。各机关企业都有越南顾问。在他工作过的那家医院，就有校级军衔的越南医生１０人，外科主刀医生不许柬埔寨人担任。原金边市警察局后勤人员波拉说，金边居民十分讨厌越南人，他们敢怒不敢言。越南每次搞“部分撤军”仪式时，当局就强迫市民上街欢送。谁拒绝，谁就会落得个“反对柬越团结”的罪名，并被送去参加“政治学习”和“体力劳动”，甚至被关进监狱。
    波拉透露，金边警察经常利用职权搞外快。长期从事药品走私活动的金最近对我们说：“去年，我认识的一些越南军人撤走了。当时，我信以为真。但是，最近我在一些城镇发现，他们中一些人又回来了。不过，他们没穿军装，还带来了家小。前些日子，我在金边突然发现一个面包店老板很面熟。原先，他是越军据点的一名军官，曾受过我的贿赂。他也认出我来，还与我和气地打招呼。”金说：“我不懂政治，不过我不相信，越南人离开金边和柬埔寨是真的。”
