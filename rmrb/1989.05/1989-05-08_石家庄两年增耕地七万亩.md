Shijiazhuang Adds 70,000 Mu of Cultivated Land in Two Years

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang

"To occupy one mu of land, first create two mu of fields." The Shijiazhuang region of Hebei Province strictly controls land management. In the past two years, the region has reclaimed nearly 10,000 mu of cultivated land, while the net increase in cultivated land has been over 70,000 mu.

Since early 1987, the Shijiazhuang region has allocated land development quotas to various departments and units simultaneously with land occupation quotas. Those who fail to complete their tasks will not receive land occupation quotas for the next year.

To ensure that the "one occupation, two developments" plan is implemented, the Shijiazhuang region has adjusted policies for developing wastelands, barren slopes, and abandoned lands. The regulation is: whoever develops the land, benefits from it, and is issued a land use certificate, which remains unchanged for 30 years.

　　石家庄两年增耕地七万亩
    本报石家庄电  “要占１亩地，先造２亩田”。河北省石家庄地区在土地管理上从严掌握，近两年，全区征占耕地近万亩，而耕地面积却净增７万多亩。
    石家庄地区从１９８７年初起，在分配各部门、各单位占地指标的同时，相应分配土地开发指标。完不成任务者，不给下年度占地指标。
    为使“占一开二”的计划落到实处，石家庄地区调整了开发荒滩、荒坡和废弃地政策，规定：谁开发，谁受益，发给土地使用证，并一定３０年不变。
