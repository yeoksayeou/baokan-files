The people of Kenya call their independent country the "land under the sun" and their capital, Nairobi, the "sunshine city." Kenyan friends say, "Without independence, even the sun would be dim."

When we arrived in Nairobi, the Kenyan people were still immersed in the joy of celebrating the 25th anniversary of their independence.

Over the past 25 years, Kenya has forged its own path and achieved remarkable progress in various fields. Especially since 1978, when President Moi took office, he proposed the "Nyayo" philosophy, which emphasizes peace, love, and unity. He has worked to develop the economy and education, improve the lives of the people, and actively promote African unity and cooperation. As a result, Kenya has achieved significant progress. Many Kenyan friends proudly refer to this decade as the "Nyayo" decade.

In this decade, Kenya's gross national product increased by 50%, and per capita income rose from $103 to over $300. Transportation grew by 60%. In agriculture, grain production increased by 500%, not only meeting the needs of the Kenyan people but also providing surplus for export and aid to neighboring countries. In 1987, tourism revenue surpassed coffee exports for the first time, earning the country 183 million pounds.

What impressed us deeply was the significant development of education over the past 10 years. The number of students entering public universities increased by 300%. Various schools have trained a large number of talented individuals for different sectors. The Kenyan government believes that education is the foundation of national prosperity; the rise and fall of a nation greatly depend on the cultural and scientific level of its people. The government has formulated a series of measures to promote education development and has enshrined them in law. In Kenya's efforts to revitalize education, people highly praise "Harambee." It means working together and is a slogan that emerged from Kenya's mass fundraising campaigns. It also represents Kenya's policy of combining government funding with community self-help to raise funds for schools. Over the years, President Moi has tirelessly fundraised for "Harambee" and has personally led by example in donating.

Agriculture is the backbone of the national economy. At the time of independence, the government prioritized agricultural development. After independence, the government implemented a series of measures to gradually solve the land problem for landless farmers and encouraged the development of small-scale farming through loans and technical support. In recent years, the government has emphasized the development of remote and backward agricultural regions, increasing investment accordingly. Due to the effectiveness of these reforms, agriculture has flourished. Currently, small-scale farmers produce 45% of commercial corn, 75% of milk, 70% of coffee, 35% of tea, and 60% of beef. Policies that suit the national conditions enabled Kenya to achieve a bumper agricultural harvest in 1986, with over 400 million tons of surplus grain in 1987.

During our visit to the Central Province, we toured coffee and tea plantations and visited farmers. Standing on the hillside, we saw vast expanses of lush coffee and tea plantations. Our guide, Mr. Peter, pointed to the land and said, "We want to develop diversified agriculture. This is a treasure trove for rice production. China has rich experience in rice production, and we want to learn from you."

Anyone who has been to Kenya cannot help but praise its "green land." We ascended to the top floor of the Kenyatta International Conference Center in Nairobi, and the lush greenery filled our eyes. This city is lush and green everywhere, with flowers blooming amidst the verdant foliage. Kenyan friends are proud of the greenery of their land. The Kenyan flag, flying high, features a large, vibrant green section. Kenya values afforestation. President Moi himself leads by example in planting trees. During our visit to the Baringo region and nurseries, we saw trees planted by the president thriving. By last year, the country had 135,000 hectares of small-scale artificial forests. To protect forests, the country has enacted strict laws, with violators facing imprisonment. The government encourages schools and other institutions at all levels to establish nurseries to provide seedlings to society. Due to the emphasis on afforestation, Kenya, which originally had only 3% forest cover, is now one of the countries in Black Africa with the largest area of artificial forests.

Kenya has received assistance from some countries and international organizations in building roads, so its road transportation is relatively developed. The total length of national roads is 150,600 kilometers. Rural roads are extensive. During our visit to the Baringo region, the hosts specially arranged for us to visit a mountain road built with the aid of the Chinese Road and Bridge Corporation. The hosts repeatedly praised the high-quality road for aiding the region's economic activity and development.

Twenty-five years of practice have proven that Kenya's implementation of a "comprehensive economic" system, prioritizing agricultural development, and effectively utilizing foreign capital are not only practical but also effective.

Our visit to Kenya made us feel that the progress Kenya has made shows that the African people have the ability and means to build their country step by step with their own wisdom. Although there will be many difficulties on the road ahead, the future will be increasingly bright.

### 阳光照耀的二十五年——肯尼亚印象

　　阳光照耀的二十五年   
     ——肯尼亚印象
    本报记者  申明河
    肯尼亚人民把独立的肯尼亚称为“阳光下的土地”，把首都内罗毕称为“阳光城”。肯尼亚朋友说，“没有独立，连太阳也暗淡无光。”
    我们抵达内罗毕时，肯尼亚人民还沉浸在庆祝独立２５周年的余欢之中。
    ２５年来，肯尼亚走自己的路，在各方面取得了可喜的成就。特别是１９７８年莫伊总统执政后，对内提出“和平、友爱、团结”为内容的“尼亚约”哲学，强调团结和稳定，致力发展经济和教育，注意改善人民的生活，对外则积极维护和促进非洲团结与合作，从而取得甚为显著的成就。许多肯尼亚朋友常以自豪的口吻把这十年称为“尼亚约”十年。
    这十年，肯尼亚国民生产总值增长了５０％，人均产值由１０３美元跃增至３００多美元；交通运输增长了６０％；在农业方面，粮食生产增长了５００％，不仅能满足本国人民的需要，而且还有剩余出口和支援邻近国家。１９８７年旅游业首次超过咖啡出口而跃居首位，为国家创汇１．８３亿英镑。
    给人印象深刻的是，１０年来教育事业有了很大的发展。进入公立大学的学生人数增加了３００％。各类学校为各行各业输送了大批有用人才。肯尼亚政府认为，教育是富国之本；民族的兴衰很大程度上决定于国民文化科学水平。政府制定了一系列促进教育发展的措施，并且以法律予以保证。在肯尼亚振兴教育的活动中，人们盛赞“哈兰姆贝”。它是齐心协力的意思，是肯尼亚人民开展群众性募捐运动中产生的口号，也是肯尼亚采取政府拨款和群众自助的两条腿走路方针来集资兴办学校。几年来，莫伊总统为“哈兰姆贝”募捐奔走，自己也带头捐款。
    农业是国民经济的支柱。独立时，政府就把发展农业放在优先地位。独立后，政府采取一系列措施，逐步解决了无地农民的土地问题，并通过发放贷款和提供技术等途径，鼓励小农经济的发展。近年来，政府强调开发偏僻、落后的农业地区，为此而不断增加投资。由于改革对头，农业得到了发展。目前，小农生产的商品玉米占４５％，牛奶占７５％，咖啡占７０％，茶叶占３５％，牛肉占６０％。符合国情的政策使肯尼亚在１９８６年获农业大丰收，１９８７年有４００万吨以上的余粮。
    我们在中部省采访时，参观了咖啡和茶叶种植园，访问了农户。站在山坡上，放眼望去，远近是一望无边的碧绿的咖啡园和茶园。陪同我们的彼得先生指着这块土地说：“我们要发展多种经营，这里是稻谷生产的宝地。中国在生产稻米方面富有经验，我们要向你们学习。”
    但凡到过肯尼亚的人，往往禁不住要赞美它那“绿色的国土”。我们登上内罗毕肯雅塔国际会议中心大厦顶层，满目苍翠奔来眼底。这座城市到处郁郁葱葱，鲜花点缀在万绿丛中。肯尼亚朋友为他们国土的绿色深感自豪。而高高飘扬的肯尼亚三色国旗上就有着大片耀眼的绿色。肯尼亚重视植树造林。莫伊总统本人带头植树。我们参观巴林戈地区和苗圃时，就看到总统亲自种的树木茁壮成长。到去年为止，全国已有１３．５万公顷的小型国有人造林。为保护森林，国家制定了严格的法律，违犯者要判刑。政府鼓励各级学校和其他机构建立小苗圃，以便向社会提供树苗。由于对植树造林的重视，原来森林覆盖率只有３％的肯尼亚，如今，已成为黑非洲拥有人造林面积最多的国家之一。
    肯尼亚在建设公路中得到一些国家和国际组织的援助，因此公路交通较发达。全国公路总长为１５．０６万公里。农村公路四通八达。在我们参观巴林戈地区时，主人特意安排我们参观了由中国路桥公司援建的盘山公路。主人一再称赞这段高质量公路建成有助于该地区经济活跃和发展。
    ２５年的实践证明，肯尼亚实行“综合经济”体制、优先发展农业和善于利用外资的政策不仅是符合实际的，而且是行之有效的。
    在肯尼亚的采访使我们感到，肯尼亚所取得的进步说明，非洲人民有能力也有办法，用自己的智慧一步步地把国家建设好。尽管在前进的道路上还会面对不少困难，但前景将是越来越光明。
