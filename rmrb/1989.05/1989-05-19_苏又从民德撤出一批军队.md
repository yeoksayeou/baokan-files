A train carrying the last batch of 20 T-64 tanks and 65 personnel from the Soviet 175th Tank Regiment departed from Prenzlau in northern East Germany via Poland today at noon. With this, the withdrawal of the 175th Tank Regiment, part of the 25th Tank Division of the Soviet Group of Forces in Germany, has been completed, and the regiment has been officially disbanded as of today.

The heads of the military missions from the United States, Britain, and France, stationed in Potsdam, attended the farewell ceremony today. This is the first time that representatives from the three Western countries have participated in a farewell ceremony for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from East Germany.

According to sources, based on Gorbachev's announcement in December last year at the United Nations, the Soviet Group of Forces in Germany has formulated a timetable for the withdrawal of troops from East Germany over the next two years. So far, more than 1,000 tanks have been withdrawn. By August this year, two tank divisions, two independent regiments, and eight independent battalions will be withdrawn from East Germany as planned. The plan to withdraw two tank divisions, one airborne brigade, three training regiments, and three independent battalions next year will also be completed on schedule.

　　苏又从民德撤出一批军队
    新华社柏林５月１７日电（记者王德峰）装载着苏军第１７５坦克团最后一批２０辆Ｔ—６４型坦克和６５名官兵的专列，今天中午离开民主德国北部的普伦茨劳取道波兰回国。至此，驻德苏军集群第２５坦克师所属第１７５坦克团的撤离行动全部结束，从当日起该团取消建制。
    常驻波茨坦苏军司令部的美、英、法３国军事使团团长出席了今天的欢送仪式。这是西方３国首次派代表参加苏军撤离民主德国的欢送仪式。
    据有关人士介绍，根据戈尔巴乔夫去年１２月在联大宣布的撤军计划，驻德苏军集群制订了今明两年从民主德国撤军的时间表。迄今苏军已撤走１０００多辆坦克。今年８月前将按计划从民德撤走２个坦克师、２个独立团和８个独立营。明年撤出２个坦克师、１个空降旅、３个教练团和３个独立营的撤军计划也将如期完成。
