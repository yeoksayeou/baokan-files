Guangzhou youth today rarely lament, "Day after day, night after night, it's better to have good parents." They advocate achieving personal value through individual effort and despise relying on parental influence or wealth to build a comfortable life.

According to statistics from the Guangzhou Municipal Labor Bureau in 1987, among the 80,000 youth contract workers that year, many had previously held "iron rice bowls" in government agencies and factories. Some university graduates preferred not to work in government agencies but chose to become managers or technicians in private enterprises. Several university graduates assigned to work in a Guangzhou municipal organization have already left their government jobs to find other opportunities. Some section-level officials have left their posts to start their own businesses. A young person with a professional degree, assigned to work in a political work department, felt that the agency was overstaffed and could not utilize his talents. After half a year, he submitted his resignation and became an individual entrepreneur.

According to a survey, many Guangzhou youth consider "not being able to leverage their strengths" as their biggest frustration. The Guangzhou Municipal Communist Youth League's Rural Department recently conducted a survey on "work opportunity selection intentions" among suburban youth. Out of 50 responses, 82% indicated a preference for jobs with good pay but high pressure, where underperformers might be "fired."

Xinhua News Agency reported that emphasizing practicality, leveraging one's strengths, striving hard, and pursuing personal values are distinctive traits of today's Guangzhou youth. This value system has received widespread praise from various sectors of society.

　　讲求实际　发挥特长　    
    广州青年追求自身价值    
    很少有人感叹“日捱夜捱不如有个好爸妈”
    本报讯  广州青年现在很少有人感叹“日捱夜捱不如有个好爸妈”了，他们崇尚通过个人努力来实现自己的人生价值，鄙视依仗父母权势或金钱为自己建立安乐窝。
    据该市劳动局１９８７年的统计，当年的８万青年合同工队伍中，不少原来是在机关工厂中捧着“铁饭碗”的。有些大学毕业生，不愿到机关当干部，宁可到民办企业中去当管理员、技术员。去年分配在广州市一个团体当干部的几位大学生，已先后自找门路离开机关。有的科级干部则弃官从商。一位有专业文凭的青年，被分配在政工部门，他感到这个机关人浮于事，不能发挥自己的特长，半年后递上辞职书，当了个体户。
    据调查，许多广州青年将“不能发挥自己特长”列为最大苦恼。共青团广州市委农村部最近向近郊青年作出“对工作机会选择意向”的调查，在５０份答卷中，占８２％的答卷是：宁可到收入好、但工作紧张、不胜任者会被“炒鱿鱼”的单位去。
    中新社在报道这条消息时认为，讲求实际，发挥自己特长，努力奋斗，追求自身价值观是当今广州青年特征之一。这种价值观受到了社会各界人士的普遍赞赏。
