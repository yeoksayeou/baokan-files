In front of a grain yield statistics chart, County Party Secretary Wang Jianzhang furrowed his brow. Despite the red arrows on the chart showing that Anping's grain production had steadily increased over the past decade, and despite the fact that in 1988, the county's total grain production set a new record with a 20% growth rate, the fate of corn still troubled him.

Anping County is located in the heart of the Hebei Plain, with 500,000 mu of arable land nestled in the high-yield corn region of North China. In the past, farmers traditionally relied on corn for food, and the harvest was always greater in the autumn than in the summer. Corn was once highly valued, which is understandable. In 1983, wheat surpassed corn in both total and per-mu yield, creating a "summer greater than autumn" situation in the county. This was undoubtedly a significant progress for Anping's rural areas, but the unexpected consequence was the farmers' "preference for the new and disregard for the old." Almost all resources—labor, technology, fertilizer, pesticides, water—were devoted to wheat, leaving corn neglected.

In the past five years, Anping's wheat yield per mu has increased by 50%, while corn yield per mu has decreased by one-third.

"Favoring summer over autumn," Wang Jianzhang told the reporter, "this mindset is a major obstacle to grain production development." The leaders of Anping saw hope in this situation: if corn could grow at the same rate as wheat, Anping's current total grain production would increase by 30%. Even if the yield per mu were maintained at the 1982 level, today's total grain production in the county would still increase by 10%.

In early 1988, the county committee and government made a decision: to use corn as a breakthrough to push grain production to a new level.

Calls, propaganda, planning, services... the officials racked their brains. Unexpectedly, the farmers' response was unusually cold. The technology of intercropping and transplanting was simple and effective, requiring no additional material input to increase production by 20%. However, "too troublesome," 90% of the households rejected the temptation to increase production with just these three words.

The fate of corn reflects people's attitudes.

Like most households in Anping, Yang Xiaozheng arranged an self-sufficient cycle for his family and pigs: wheat for humans, corn for pigs. You have to grow some grain, but you don't want to grow too much. "I don't care about the market price of grain," he said, "I don't seek advantage, nor do I suffer a loss." Another farmer, Qi Suozhen, had a similar idea. "I'm not afraid of storing grain," she said, "I'm afraid of selling grain and buying grain." Her family grows a lot of grain and has a surplus, but she doesn't want to sell it. Her son and daughter-in-law both work temporarily in the city, and she is worried that if her son comes back and the grain price goes up, he won't be able to buy any. It's clear that not selling grain now is to avoid buying grain later. She blinked her eyes and said, "In the past, grain was stored for famine; now, grain is stored for the market."

The reporter traveled through Anping, visiting villages and households, and everywhere felt farmers' careful efforts to avoid losses from low grain prices. Many households grow grain, first for "contract purchases," second for "self-sufficiency." As for the part beyond "self-sufficiency," it can be taken or left.

Behind the farmers' preference for summer over autumn is a preference for self-sufficiency and a disregard for commercial grain. In the eyes of the government, the more than 10 million kilograms of contracted grain sold by Anping farmers each year can be considered commercial, but in the eyes of the farmers, this is just a contribution to the country, unrelated to commerce. Coupled with the officials' urging and forced collection, the unpredictable opening and closing of the market, the shortage and high cost of production materials, and the grain price being lower than its value, all this makes the so-called commercial grain in the eyes of the farmers a name without substance.

Anping County's grain market is located in a low-lying area south of the city. Every market day, cars, bags, and people crowd the roads, but the actual transactions are greatly discounted. According to the market management office, last year, only 10 million kilograms of grain were traded here, meaning that for every 100 kilograms of grain produced by Anping farmers, less than 1 kilogram is freely sold on the market.

The leaders are working hard to promote grain production; every farmer the reporter met said, "selling grain is a loss." Reality is more convincing than the officials' speeches at meetings. Taicheng Village, which ranks first in both grain production and sales in the county, is far from being as wealthy as Beiguo Village. The fact is clear to everyone. Beiguo's secret to wealth is to keep grain production at the level of "ensuring contract purchases and self-sufficiency," while putting all its effort into medicinal herb production. Because the income from one mu of medicinal herbs is four times that of one mu of grain.

Nanwang Village's Wang Xiaoji seems to be an exception.

This person was once famous nationwide. More than 30 years ago, he and two other households formed a cooperative that was called "the direction for 500 million peasants" by Mao Zedong. Today, he has once again become the focus of the county. He has no sideline, devoting all his energy to corn, fertilizing, irrigating, and pollinating plant by plant, and then selling all the harvest to the state. "You shouldn't think my consciousness is so high," this old model told the reporter, "I grow corn because there is a good price." He grows only corn seeds, and the county seed company has signed a contract with him to buy all of them at market price, which can give him three times the income of ordinary corn.

The real market signals have a much greater impact on farmers than government slogans. Since last autumn, the grain price in Anping market has suddenly risen by 50% to 100%, and the upward trend has not stopped even after this year's Spring Festival, causing a considerable stir in farmers' minds. The leaders of Anping have also changed their traditional approach, constantly reporting market price changes to farmers and encouraging them to go to the market. The "corn fever" that the government has been trying to stir up for a year has suddenly heated up.

In the past, the seed station would not release corn seeds until after the Qingming Festival, but this spring, farmers lined up outside the station as soon as the Spring Festival was over. Of course, not all varieties are popular. In the past, farmers only cared about varieties with a short growth period and less labor, and a slightly lower yield was not a concern. This year, however, everyone is competing to buy "Corn Queen." Although this "queen" has a long production period and is difficult to manage, the yield is quite high. This means that the intercropping technology for corn, which has been promoted for a year without success, will now be promoted.

Outside the seed station's gate, a farmer is squatting down, carefully picking up a few grains of "Corn Queen" that have fallen to the ground...

The forces guiding farmers' behavior are clearly twofold: administrative and market. "Administrative power can't do what market power can," said County Party Secretary Wang Jianzhang.

　　玉米的命运
    本报记者  凌志军
    　　　　（一）
    在一幅粮食产量统计表前，县委书记王建章眉头紧皱，尽管统计表上的红色箭头显示着安平粮食１０年来一直在稳步增产，尽管１９８８年全县粮食总产以２０％的增长率创下新的纪录，可是，玉米的命运仍在困扰着他。
    安平县处冀中平原腹地，全县５０万亩耕地镶在华北玉米高产区，过去农家一向以玉米为食，庄稼的收获也总是“秋”大于“夏”。昔日玉米受人厚爱是可想而知的。１９８３年，小麦后来居上，总产和亩产均超过玉米，在全县形成“夏”大于“秋”的局面。这自然是安平农村中一个了不起的进步，但是，随之而来的农民的“喜新厌旧”却是始料不及的。精力、技术、化肥、农药、水……几乎全都给了小麦，玉米竟是被冷落了。
    最近５年中，安平小麦亩产突飞猛进地增长了５０％，而玉米亩产却减少１／３。
    “重夏轻秋”，王建章对记者说，“农民的这种心理是发展粮食生产的一大障碍”。安平的领导者正是从这中间看到了希望：假如玉米与小麦同样增长，安平现有的粮食总产将增加３０％，即使把亩产仅仅维持在１９８２年的水平，今天全县粮食总产也可增加一成。
    １９８８年初，县委、县政府定下决策：以玉米为突破口，推动全县粮食再上一个新台阶。
    号召、宣传、规划、服务……干部们费尽心机。不料，农民的反应出奇冷淡。套种栽培的技术简明而有实效，不需增加任何物的投入便可使产量增长两成。可是，“太麻烦”，９０％的农户只凭这３个字就拒绝了增产的诱惑。

    玉米的命运折射着人的心态。
    像安平大多数农户一样，杨小整给自家的人和猪都安排了一个自给自足的循环圈：小麦，人吃；玉米，猪吃。不能不种点粮，也不肯多种粮。“我不管市场粮价高低，”他说，“不占便宜，也不吃亏。”另一个农民嵇素贞的想法与杨家有异曲同工之妙。“我不怕存粮，”她说，“就怕卖粮、买粮。”她家粮食种得多，余粮也多，但她不肯卖。她的儿子、儿媳都在城里干临时工，她担心家里无存粮，万一儿子回来赶上粮价上涨，买不起。很明显，现在不卖粮是为了以后不买粮。她眨着眼睛说：“过去存粮为备荒，现在存粮叫备市。”
    记者在安平走村串户，随处可以感到农民煞费苦心地避免粮价过低给他们带来的损失。不少农户种粮，一为“定购”，二保“自足”，至于“自足”以外的部分，便可有可无了。
    农民重夏轻秋的背后，是重自给自足、轻商品粮的心态。在政府看来，安平农民每年卖出的１０００多万公斤合同定购粮是可以算作商品的，在农民看来，这不过是为国家作了一份贡献，与商品不搭边。再加上干部的催交强收，市场的开关无常，生产资料的短缺与昂贵，粮食价格低于价值，这一切都使所谓商品粮在农民眼里有名无实。
    安平县粮市辟在城南一片洼地中。每逢赶集日，车拉袋扛，人拥路塞，但是，真正的成交却打了很大的折扣。据市场管理所介绍，去年在这里成交的粮食，不过１００万公斤，也就是说，安平农民每生产１００公斤粮食，在市场上自由卖出的不到１公斤。
    领导者们在全力抓粮食生产；而记者见到的每一个农民都说，“卖粮吃亏。”现实，比干部们会上讲的“道道”更有说服力。产粮、售粮均居全县前茅的台城村，却远不如北郭村富有的事实，谁都看在眼里。北郭致富的诀窍是始终把粮食生产维持在“一保定购，二保自足”的水平上，而将其他的劲儿全用到了药材生产上。因为１亩药材的收入比１亩粮食高４倍。
    　　　　（三）
    南王庄村的王小其似乎是一个例外。
    此人曾一度闻名全国。３０多年前，他和另外两户农民组成的合作社，被毛泽东称为“五亿农民的方向”。今天，他再次成为全县瞩目的人。他没有什么副业，只把全部的精力都用在玉米上，施肥、浇水、打药，一株一株地授粉，再把全部的收获交售给国家。“你不要以为我的觉悟有多高。”这个老典型对记者说，“我种玉米是因为有一个好价格。”他种的全是玉米种子，县种子公司与他签订了合同，全部按市价购买，这可以使他得到３倍于普通玉米的收入。
    真正的市场信号对农民的影响远远大于政府的口号。安平市场的粮价自去年秋后忽然涨了５０％至１００％，至今年春节后涨势仍然不止，这在农民的心理上引起一阵不小的骚动。安平的领导者也一改传统的作法，不断向农民通报市场价格变化，并鼓动农民到市场去。政府用了一年时间没能鼓动起来的“玉米热”，居然很快升温了。
    种子站，往年过了清明，玉米种才开始出库，今年春节刚过，农民便在这里排起“长龙”。当然不是所有的品种都旺销。过去，农民只要生长期短，种着省力的品种，产量略低也不在乎。今年，大家却争购“玉米皇后”。虽然这“皇后”生产期长，难伺候，但产量相当高。这意味，推了一年没有推开的玉米套种技术，这回是不推就开了。
    种子站的大门外，一位农民正蹲下身去，小心地把掉在地上的几粒“玉米皇后”一一捡起……
    引导农民行为的力量明显地有两种，一为行政的；一为市场的。“行政力量办不好的事，现在市场的力量办好了。”县委书记王建章说。
