Title: The Market That "Rips Off" Customers Needs to Be Rectified

The market opposite the 332 bus stop at the Beijing Zoo, which locals call the "rip-off market," has had problems for a long time. A few years ago, some people reported these issues to the media, but the relevant departments did not take serious action, allowing this "rip-off market" to continue unchecked.

I know of three incidents. The first time, three farmers from Henan who were in Beijing to sell their calligraphy and paintings bought a watermelon. After eating it, they found out the vendor was charging over 30 yuan. When they tried to argue, five or six young men intervened, and they were so frightened that they paid up. The three farmers told me, "Those people are so ruthless! So cruel! So cunning!"

Another time, a relative of mine who had returned from the United States to visit Beijing passed through the area and bought a piece of melon. After eating it, the vendor demanded 40 yuan. My relative was very dissatisfied and said that the vendor's actions "damaged the feelings of overseas Chinese towards Beijing, towards the motherland, and towards the Chinese nation."

Yet another time, I saw two soldiers being "ripped off" and then attacked. I stepped in to say a few fair words, but a short, stocky man with a small beard punched me from behind.

In this key transportation hub and tourist area, who knows how many people have been "ripped off"? This March, I met a traveler from Jiangsu in Chengde. When he found out I was from Beijing, he flew into a rage and started cursing Beijing people. It turned out he had been extorted 28 yuan at a melon stall near the zoo!

I suggest that the relevant departments should thoroughly rectify this "rip-off market." They should also investigate some of the market management personnel there. I once saw a young management official "resolve" a dispute between a vendor and a customer. After the customer left, he accepted a pack of imported cigarettes from the vendor.

In Beijing, there are still many such illegal vendors. Their behavior damages the reputation of the capital and must be rectified. Otherwise, Beijing will lose its good image!

### 这个“宰”人市场该整顿

　　这个“宰”人市场该整顿
    动物园３３２路公共汽车站对面的“宰”人市场（老百姓都这样叫它），问题存在并非一日。前几年，有些人向新闻单位反映，但有关部门没有认真整顿，致使这个“宰”人市场成了特殊地段。
    我知道有这样３件事。第一次，河南农村来京的３位农民书画家称了１个西瓜，吃完一算帐，商贩索价３０多元。他们刚要讲理，就上来五六个小伙子，他们被吓得只好掏钱。这３位农民书画家痛心地对我说：“这些人真凶啊！真狠啊！真奸啊！”
    再一次，我的亲戚从美国回京探亲路过那里，买了块哈密瓜，吃完后，摊商要价４０元。我的亲戚对此十分不满，说摊商这种做法“破坏了海外华人对北京、对祖国、对中华民族的感情”。
    还有一次，我路过那里，看到两位解放军战士被“宰”后还遭到围攻。我上前讲了几句公道话，竟被一个蓄小胡子的黑胖子从背后打了一拳。
    在这个交通枢纽和重点游览地区，真不知有多少人挨过“宰”。今年３月，我在承德碰到一位江苏旅客。他听说我是北京来的，就火冒三丈地大骂北京人。说来说去，是因为他在动物园某瓜摊上曾被敲诈了２８元！
    我建议：有关部门应该彻底整顿这个“宰”人市场。同时，还应查一查那里的个别市场管理人员。我曾看到一个年轻的管理人员“处理”完一起摊商与顾客的纠纷后，顾客一走，他就接过摊商给的一包进口香烟。
    在北京，类似这样的不法摊商还不少，这些摊商的行为有损首都的声誉，必须加以整顿。否则，北京将失去她美好的形象！
