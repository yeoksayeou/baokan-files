　　百余中外科学家称  合肥同步辐射装置了不起
    据新华社合肥５月１３日电（记者田文喜、宜奉华）正在合肥出席国际同步辐射应用会议的１００多位中外科学家，高度评价合肥国家同步辐射装置建成并出光是一项了不起的成就。
    中国科学院学部委员、合肥同步辐射用户委员会主任、著名物理学家谢希德教授说，这是我国第一台专用同步辐射装置，是在比较困难的条件下做出来的，很不容易。
    曾４次来合肥考察和帮助建造合肥同步辐射装置的美国斯坦福大学同步辐射实验室负责人赫尔曼·维尼克说，这台装置做的很快、很成功。
    在同步辐射技术方面正在迅速起步的巴西、印度、南朝鲜等一些发展中国家的专家、学者，看了合肥同步辐射装置后非常兴奋。他们说，中国的科技成就对他们是一个鼓舞。
