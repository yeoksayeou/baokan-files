Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 8th.

Yugoslavia's Belgrade Military Court today began trying an illegal hostile group that had infiltrated the People's Army.

This group, which calls itself a branch of the "Kosovo Marxist-Leninist" organization, has existed for many years at the center of the Yugoslav Higher Military Academy. Although its members frequently change due to the regulated term of military service, its organizational structure and activities have been sustained. Its program is to establish a "Kosovo Republic" and "Greater Albania," with Albanian soldiers as the core, and to recruit soldiers from other ethnic groups who harbor hostile sentiments towards Yugoslavia. The 10 members on trial attempted to set fire to the significant hall of the Higher Military Academy on August 23rd and 27th of last year (Josip Broz Tito had received his first military science doctorate there). They are accused of committing criminal offenses of terrorist hostile activities. According to Yugoslav criminal law, they face a minimum sentence of 5 years in prison.

　　南法院审判敌对集团    
    指控其犯有恐怖活动罪
    本报贝尔格莱德５月８日电  记者严正报道：据《新闻晚报》消息，南斯拉夫贝尔格莱德军事法院今天开庭审判混迹人民军中的非法敌对小集团。
    这个自称为“科索沃马列主义者”组织分支机构的敌对小集团已在南斯拉夫高等军事学校中心存在多年，虽然由于服兵役的期限有规定，其成员常有变化，但它的组织形式和活动一直被延续下来，其纲领是建立“科索沃共和国”和“大阿尔巴尼亚”，以阿族士兵为骨干，并接收对南斯拉夫怀有敌对情绪的其它族士兵。这次被审判的１０个成员于去年８月２３日和２７日曾两次试图纵火焚烧高等军事学校具有重要意义的大厅（铁托曾在那里接受第一名军事科学博士称号）。他们被指控犯有进行恐怖主义敌对活动的刑事罪，按照南斯拉夫的刑法，至少要判５年徒刑。
