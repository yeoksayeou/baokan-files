Farmers lack fertilizer and eagerly await it, but fertilizer plants are having a hard time. In Shandong, 89 small fertilizer plants have 30 either shut down or operating at half capacity, with 41 running at a loss. The situation at the Laizhou City Fertilizer Plant is a clear example:

Small Fertilizer Plants Struggle to Produce

The Laizhou City Fertilizer Plant in Shandong Province is a small-scale plant with an annual production capacity of 40,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate. In the first quarter of this year, it produced 13,000 tons of fertilizer and made a profit of 3,000 yuan, making it one of the better-performing small fertilizer plants. Recently, relevant departments of the provincial government have been summarizing their experiences in maintaining production to serve agriculture. However, the plant's director and party secretary told us that maintaining production this year has been a struggle; they can't keep going like this much longer.

This year's fertilizer production has faced difficulties in every aspect, from coal, electricity, water, and oil to funds, transportation, and technological upgrades. The two most significant challenges are coal and funds.

First, there is the issue of coal. The plant needs 40,000 tons of coal for raw materials and fuel to meet its annual production needs, but there has been a significant shortage since last year. To address this, relevant departments in the city have opened up channels to find coal sources. The coal shortage has driven up prices, with the cost of a ton of raw coal jumping from 120-130 yuan in the fourth quarter of last year to 260-270 yuan. The price hike has further exacerbated the shortage. Even with a plan and quota, they have to run around coal mines and train stations, doing favors up and down the line. Otherwise, a slight oversight could cause the plan and quota to fall through. Unable to wait for rail transport, they have had to organize long-distance truck transport, regardless of the cost. To ensure normal fertilizer production in the first quarter, on the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month last year, they organized 26 trucks from within and outside the plant to go to Yangquan in Shanxi to get coal, traveling over 1,500 kilometers round trip. They returned just in time for the New Year and headed back to Shanxi immediately after. Truck transport has also been affected by the shortage of subsidized diesel, forcing them to buy at higher prices. To produce fertilizer and support agriculture, the plant has had to overlook economic considerations.

The second major challenge is funding. Compared to last year, coal prices have doubled, but fertilizer prices have remained the same. Additionally, coal mines now require payment one month in advance, making the loan quota insufficient and causing cash flow problems. This has led to a situation where they are "waiting for rice to cook" but have "no money to buy rice." In the first lunar month this year, they managed to secure a batch of coal, but urgently needed funds. The city government held an emergency meeting, allocating 300,000 yuan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank and 200,000 yuan from the Urban Credit Cooperative. They were still short by 300,000 yuan, so they had to mobilize employees to raise funds. Fortunately, the employees understood the situation, and many borrowed money from friends and family. The city's managing company also raised 100,000 yuan to support the fertilizer plant, allowing them to scrape by this time.

However, clearing one hurdle means facing another. Currently, the fertilizer plant has accounts with four financial institutions: the Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank, the Construction Bank, and the Urban Credit Cooperative. All of them are in debt, and by the end of March, there were 2.42 million yuan in overdue loans, with interest doubling and no ability to repay. Additionally, they need to prepay at least 600,000 yuan for coal each month. Besides this, the Laizhou Fertilizer Plant faces several unique local difficulties. For instance, Laizhou City is far from the railway station, with the nearest station in Weifang being over 120 kilometers away. This alone adds 1 million yuan in trucking costs per year. Laizhou has also suffered from severe water shortages for years, and although the fertilizer plant is located in a plain, the groundwater level has dropped to over 120 meters. They have to buy water from afar, with the cost of transporting water to the plant reaching 0.40 yuan per cubic meter. With an annual water usage of 1.5 million cubic meters, just the cost of buying water amounts to 600,000 yuan...

The current difficulties faced by small fertilizer production are not unique to one plant or one location. The causes of these difficulties are not limited to one plant or one location. As a member of small fertilizer enterprises, the leaders of the Laizhou City Fertilizer Plant have shared their grievances, hoping that relevant higher-level departments will understand the serious situation facing small fertilizer production, pay attention to it, and take emergency measures.

　　农民缺化肥，盼化肥，化肥厂的日子却不好过。山东８９家小化肥厂，有３  ０家停产或半停产，４１家亏损。从莱州市化肥厂就可以看出：
    小化肥在挣扎中生产
    邓兆安　温立平　曲怀生
    山东省莱州市化肥厂是一处年产能力为４万吨碳酸氢铵的小化肥厂。今年第一季度，共产化肥１．３万吨，盈利３０００元，属于目前小化肥厂家中的上游企业。最近，省政府有关部门正在总结他们坚持生产为农业服务的经验。但是，接待笔者的厂长、书记却说，今年能够维持生产，全是在拚命挣扎；再往下拚，可实在支撑不住了。
    今年的化肥生产，从煤、电、水、油到资金、运输、技术改造，处处是难关。最突出的有两难。第一是煤炭。全年生产化肥需要原料煤和燃料煤共４万多吨，从去年以来，一直缺口很大。为此，市有关部门开辟渠道寻找货源。煤炭紧张，价格上涨，去年第４季度以来，一吨原煤由一百二三十元，猛涨到二百六七十元。价格上涨又加剧了货源紧张。即使列入计划，搞到指标，也得跑煤矿、跑火车站，上上下下“做工作”。否则稍有疏忽，已经到手的计划、指标就会“流产”落空。铁路运输等不起，只得不顾运费高低，组织汽车长途运输。为了保证第一季度化肥正常生产，去年腊月２４日，他们从厂内外组织了２６部汽车，到山西阳泉拉煤，往返１５００多公里，年三十才返回，刚过年又重返山西。搞汽车运输平价油不足，只得花高价。为了生产化肥，支援农业，化肥厂家什么经济帐也没法算了。
    第二大难关是资金。与去年相比，煤炭价格翻番，化肥价格不变，加之今年煤矿要求提前一个月预付货款，使贷款指标远远不足，流动资金周转不开，造成一方面“等米下锅”，一方面“无钱买米”。今年农历正月，好不容易搞到一批煤炭，急需资金。市政府专门召开紧急会议，从工商银行调剂３０万元，城市信用社调剂２０万元，尚缺３０万元，无可奈何发动职工集资。好在职工顾全大局，不少人求亲告友，借债集资。市主管公司也集资万元支持化肥厂，这才凑齐了这笔款，度过了这道难关。
    但是，过了一道关，还有千道关。眼下，化肥厂在工商行、农行、建行、城市信用社４个金融单位家家开户，家家负债，到３月底，还有２４２万元贷款逾期，利息加倍，无力偿还；而且预付煤炭款每月至少得６０万元。除此，莱州化肥厂还有不少地域性的特殊困难。如莱州市远离火车站，最近的潍坊站距莱州城也１２０多公里，仅此一项，一年就多付汽车运费１００万元；莱州连年严重缺水，化肥厂虽地处平原，地下水位下降到１２０多米，附近不能打井需要远距离花钱买水，一方水送到厂内，成本达０．４０元，一年用水１５０万方，仅买水就得６０万元……
    目前小化肥生产的困难，也决非一厂一地所有，造成这些困难的原因，决非一厂一地所致。作为小化肥企业的一员，莱州市化肥厂的领导者一述苦衷，希望上级有关部门对小化肥生产的严峻形势了解真情，引起重视，采取急救措施。
