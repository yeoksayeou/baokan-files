The first National Club Cup Men's Basketball Tournament is in full swing. Liaoning Team's strength is superior, and Qianwei Team emerges as a dark horse.

Yueyang, May 18th - The reporter Wang Dazhao reports: The first round of the National Club Cup Men's Basketball Tournament concluded its fifth round of group matches tonight at the Yueyang City Gymnasium. Starting tomorrow, Liaoning Team, Shenyang Military Region Team, Qianwei Team, and Guangxi Team will compete for the top four spots.

The Chinese Basketball Association, in order to select participants for the quadrennial Asian Club Cup, has established the National Club Cup since this year. The 12 teams participating in this year's tournament are all teams sponsored by enterprises or jointly built with enterprises. Although many of them are national men's basketball first-tier teams, some basketball powerhouses are affected by the "strategy" of preparing for the Youth Games and the National Games in various places, and the condition and level of the teams are not ideal. As a result, the differences in age, height, skills, and experience among the teams are quite apparent.

Liaoning Team, which has dominated the basketball scene for two years, has a strong lineup and a complete roster. They have consecutively defeated five opponents in a manner reminiscent of the strong preying on the weak, even setting a record of scoring 132 points and a net victory of 75 points in a single game.

Two second-tier teams, Qianwei Team and Guangxi Team, advanced from Group B, which is closely related to their cherished attitude towards training opportunities. The Qianwei Team, with an average height of 1.94 meters, has active defense and has won five consecutive matches. In the third round, when facing the old national player Zhang Bin's Jinnan Military Region Team, the number 8 player Qin Jingshun made eight accurate left-handed long-range shots. In this match, the Qianwei Team made 18 three-point and four-point shots, scoring 69 points, and finally won 123:90.

Chinese Basketball Association Secretary-General Yang Bozhen, while watching the game on the sidelines, told the reporter that in most matches, especially those between younger teams without star players, the intensity is high and the competition is fierce. Experts also believe that no team can stop Liaoning Team from winning the championship. Even in the final match for the championship and runner-up, not losing to Liaoning Team by 30 points would be considered good. However, Yang Bozhen pointed out that including Liaoning Team, the domestic basketball scene generally has weaknesses in defense.

### 首届全国俱乐部杯男子篮球赛激战正酣  辽宁队实力超群　前卫队异军突起

　　首届全国俱乐部杯男子篮球赛激战正酣    
    辽宁队实力超群　前卫队异军突起
    本报岳阳５月１８日电  记者汪大昭报道：第一届全国俱乐部杯男子篮球赛今晚在岳阳市体育馆打完了五轮的分组赛，辽宁队、沈阳军区队、前卫队和广西队将从明天开始争夺前４名。
    中国篮球协会为选拔参加４年一届的亚洲俱乐部杯赛，从今年开始，设立全国俱乐部杯赛。参加今年比赛的１２支球队，都是得到企业资助或与企业共建的队伍。虽然其中多为全国男篮甲级队，但一些篮球劲旅受到各地备战青运会和全运会的“战略”影响，队伍的状况和水平都不甚理想，以致各队间在年龄、身高、技术和经验等方面差距显而易见。
    已两年独霸篮坛的辽宁队实力雄厚，阵容整齐，弱肉强食般地依次打败了５个对手，还创下了一场比赛得１３２分和净胜７５分的纪录。
    两支乙级队前卫队和广西队从Ｂ组出线，与他们珍惜锻炼机会的参赛态度有很大关系。平均身高１米９４的前卫队防守积极，连胜５场，在第三轮迎战老国手张斌统领的济南军区队时，８号秦京春准确的左手远投８次命中。前卫队在这场比赛中的３分球和４分球共有１８次中鹄，得了６９分，最后以１２３∶９０大胜。
    中国篮协秘书长杨伯镛在场边观战时对记者说，多数场次，特别是较为年轻、没有尖子队员的队之间的比赛，强度大，拚得很苦。行家们还认为，没有一个队能阻止辽宁队夺冠之势，即便是冠亚军决赛的那一场，不输给辽宁队３０分就算不错了。不过，杨伯镛指出，包括辽宁队在内，我国篮坛在防守方面普遍存在弱点。
