	Three years ago, Beijing Fourth Pharmaceutical Factory had no inventory of ginseng royal jelly products. By the first quarter of this year, the factory had accumulated 10 million boxes of ginseng royal jelly. Recently, a market report titled "Why Are Tonics Losing Favor?" reported that across the country, tonic medicines worth billions of yuan are "unsellable."

	Last year, there were over 200 factories producing tonic medicines registered with the China Medicinal Materials Company nationwide, whereas three years ago there were only about a dozen. Various types of tonics have now developed to 3,688 kinds. Last year, the annual output value of tonic medicines nationwide reached 1 billion yuan, with a large number of products piled up in storage.

	Tonic medicines not selling well has prompted manufacturers to rack their brains over advertising, elegant packaging, and sales promotion. Some manufacturers even offer pharmacies a 10-20% rebate.

    数亿元滋补药压库
    本报讯  去年第四季度前没有人参蜂王精产品库存的北京第四制药厂，今年一季度积压的人参蜂王精已达１０００万盒。最近一期市场报以《滋补药为何失宠》为题，报道了全国价值数亿元的滋补药产品“卖不出去”的情况。
    去年，全国仅在中国药材公司挂号的生产补药厂就有２００多家，而３年前只有十几个。各类补药已经发展到３６８８种。去年全国滋补药年产值１０亿元，大批产品积压在库。
    滋补药卖不出去，促使厂家在广告宣传、精美包装和推销上绞尽脑汁。有的厂家竟给药店１０—２０％的回扣。
