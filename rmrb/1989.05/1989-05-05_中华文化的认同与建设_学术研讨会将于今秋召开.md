The "Identification and Construction of Chinese Culture" Academic Symposium, organized by the Chinese Culture Friendship Association and the China Culture Press, will be held from October 23 to 27 in Xi'an, a historic and cultural city in China. Experts and scholars from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and the mainland will gather to exchange ideas, express their views, reflect on the past, and promote Chinese culture. They will also visit the ancient sites of Chang'an.

Chinese culture is rich and profound, serving as a unifying force for the Chinese nation and one of the oldest systems in human culture. In the context of today's world culture, it faces the need for a re-evaluation of its value and the need to be reshaped and transformed to adapt to modernization. The position of Chinese culture in world culture, the integration and unification of Chinese culture, the prospects for the development of Chinese culture, the cultural identity of Chinese people living in different regions, as well as the excavation, organization, and construction of Chinese cultural heritage, including specific areas such as Chinese characters, traditional Chinese medicine, folklore, martial arts, and more, are all topics that need to be deeply explored and are within the scope of this symposium.

During the preparatory stage of the symposium, opinions from many experts and scholars at home and abroad were solicited, and universal approval and support were obtained.
