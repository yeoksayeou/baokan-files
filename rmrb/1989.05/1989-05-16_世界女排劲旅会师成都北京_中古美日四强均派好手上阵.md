Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 16th.

The director of the Training and Competition Department II of the State Sports Commission, Wu Shouchang, stated today that the newly adjusted Chinese women's volleyball team is young, and the main lineup is still in the process of forming. He emphasized that the team's discipline should be stricter, and expectations for results should not be too high. He believes that it will be difficult for the Chinese team to win the championship in the upcoming four-nation women's volleyball tournament.

Wu made these remarks at the press conference for the 1989 Haiyan Cup Beijing International Women's Volleyball Four-Nation Tournament held today.

The participating teams from Cuba, the United States, Japan, and China will compete in Chengdu on May 23 and 24. The tournament will then move to Beijing for matches on May 26 and 27. The Cuban women's volleyball team is a world powerhouse and the champion of last year's four-nation tournament. Among the 12 players participating in this tournament, 7 are former national team members, including the famous "Black Tornado" Luis. Notably absent from the Cuban team's roster are the renowned players Capote and Gonzalez, who are both pregnant and have not competed this year.

The head coach of the Japanese women's volleyball team is Naoki Nakano. Out of the 17 players, 6 are former national team members. The American women's volleyball team is known for its tall players, with 8 out of the 12 players being former national team members.

The Chinese women's volleyball team arrived in Chengdu on May 14. It is understood that key player Li Yueling recently underwent surgery for appendicitis and will not be able to compete. Li Yunwu, who stands at 1.78 meters, will replace her as the substitute attacker. The coach believes this will affect the team's strength.

　　世界女排劲旅会师成都北京  中古美日四强均派好手上阵
    新华社北京５月１６日电（记者李贺普）国家体委训练竞赛二司司长吴寿章今天在这里说，调整后的中国女排队伍年轻，主力阵容正在形成之中。对女排姑娘在作风上要求要严一些，在成绩上期望不要过高。他认为，中国队在四国女排赛上拿冠军是困难的。吴寿章是在今天举行的１９８９年海燕电视杯北京国际女排四强赛新闻发布会上讲这番话的。
    参赛的古巴、美国、日本和中国女排将于本月２３、２４日在成都比赛。然后，移师北京，于２６、２７日进行比赛。古巴女排是世界劲旅，也是去年四国女排赛冠军。参加这次比赛的１２名队员中有７名原国家队队员，其中包括“黑旋风”路易斯。在古巴队员的名单中没有著名选手卡波特和冈萨雷斯的名字。据悉，她俩都已有身孕，今年一直没有参加比赛。
    日本女排主教练为宗内则行，１７名队员中有６名原国家队队员。美国女排的特点是身材高大，１２名队员中有８名是原国家队队员。
    中国女排已于１４日赴成都。据了解，主力队员李月明不久前因阑尾炎做了手术，不能参赛。接替她打副攻的将是身高１米７８的李云武。教练认为，这将影响中国队的实力。
