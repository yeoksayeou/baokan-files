Recently concluded in Zhengzhou, the National Commodity Exchange Fair, with a transaction volume of 1.1 billion yuan, saw severe tax evasion. Out of the 330,000 yuan in stamp tax that should have been collected, only 21.7 yuan was actually collected, and no evaders were held accountable.

From April 8 to 10, representatives from 37 provinces and cities across the nation, nearly 20,000 businesspeople, gathered in Zhengzhou. According to the organizing committee, the transaction volume recorded was 1.1 billion yuan, but the actual transaction volume was close to 1.6 billion yuan. According to the "Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax of the People's Republic of China" issued by the State Council, this exchange fair should have collected at least 330,000 yuan in stamp tax.

To organize the collection of this stamp tax, the Zhengzhou Municipal Tax Bureau's direct-affiliated branch made arrangements a week in advance, assigning 10 tax officials to be on-site for collection. However, their efforts yielded only 21.7 yuan in stamp tax, which was not even 1/10 of the propaganda expenses they incurred.

Why was it so difficult to collect the stamp tax? According to the leadership of the Zhengzhou Municipal Tax Bureau's direct-affiliated branch, the primary reason is that taxpayers lack awareness of their legal obligations to pay taxes and intentionally evade or underreport taxes. During the exchange fair, not a single individual or unit voluntarily paid taxes. When tax officials went to collect, they were either evaded with excuses like "I've never heard of stamp tax and haven't prepared for it" or "My superiors haven't instructed me, so I can't decide on my own." Some even concealed contracts or signed and fled immediately.

The penalty provisions in the relevant regulations are ineffective against customers who disperse after transactions.

### 全国货栈商品交易会偷漏税严重  ３３万印花税只收到２１元

　　全国货栈商品交易会偷漏税严重    
    ３３万印花税只收到２１元
    本报郑州５月３日电  记者李而亮报道：不久前在郑州闭幕、成交额达１１亿元的全国货栈商品交易会上，本来至少应征收３３万元的印花税款，仅仅收得２１元７角，而偷漏税者却无一受到追究处理。
    ４月８日至１０日，来自全国各省市的３７个代表团，近２万名客商云集郑州。据承办单位透露，交易会统计上来的商品成交额达１１亿元，实际成交额接近１６亿元。根据国务院颁发的《中华人民共和国印花税暂行条例》，这次交易会至少应缴纳印花税３３万元。
    为组织征收这笔印花税，郑州市税务局直属分局提前一周就作了安排，抽调１０名税务干部坐会专收。然而，他们忙碌一场，收到的印花税款，还不足他们为此付出宣传费用的１／１０。
    征收印花税何以如此困难？据郑州市直属税务分局的领导分析，纳税人依法纳税意识淡薄，有意偷、漏税是直接原因。交易会上，无一人一单位主动纳税，税务人员前去征收，他们或以“不曾听说过印花税，没有准备”为由搪塞，或以“领导未交待，自己不能做主”推托，有的干脆隐瞒合同，或合同一签就溜之大吉。
    有关条例上的罚款规定，对那些成交后各奔东西的客户鞭长莫及。
