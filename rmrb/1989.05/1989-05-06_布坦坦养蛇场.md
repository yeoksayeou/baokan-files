In the suburbs of São Paulo, Brazil, there is a snake farm known as the Butantan Snake Farm, the largest in all of the Americas. This farm houses over 270 different species of snakes, 70 of which are venomous and used to produce antivenom. In addition, it also breeds tens of thousands of poisonous spiders and scorpions, from which antivenoms for spider and scorpion bites are made.

Each snake enclosure in the Butantan Snake Farm holds about 50 snakes. These snakes are fed every 20 to 30 days, with each snake typically consuming 5 mice per meal.

The process of producing antivenom is quite interesting. Venom extracted from the venomous snakes is regularly injected into horses. Each horse receives several types of snake venom per injection. After the injection, the horses' bodies produce antibodies, which are then processed to create the life-saving antivenom.

Horses have a particularly strong resistance to snake venom. However, despite this, about 10% of the horses still succumb to the toxins and die after being injected with multiple types of snake venom each month.

　　布坦坦养蛇场
    在巴西圣保罗市郊，有一个全美洲最大的养蛇场——闻名遐迩的布坦坦养蛇场。这个蛇场共养有２７０多种蛇，其中７０种为毒蛇，用以制成抗毒蛇药。除此之外，它还养有数万只毒蜘蛛和蝎子，用它们的毒素制成抗毒蜘蛛药和抗毒蝎药。
    布坦坦养蛇场每个蛇舍放养５０条蛇，它们每隔２０到３０天饱餐一顿，每条蛇每次一般吞食５只老鼠。
    抗毒蛇药的制作过程颇耐人寻味。先把从毒蛇身上取出的毒液定期注射在马身上，每匹马每次要注射好几种毒蛇液。马在注射毒蛇液之后体内就产生了抗体，这些抗体经过处理后，最终就成了救人性命的抗毒蛇药了。
    马对蛇毒具有特别强的抵抗力，但尽管如此，在经过每月注射多种毒蛇液之后，还是有１０％的马匹顶不住巨毒而死去。
