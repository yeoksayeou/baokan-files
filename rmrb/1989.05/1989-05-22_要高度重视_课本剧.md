The middle school language arts textbooks include many world literary classics. Some are short stories or essays, while others are excerpts from longer works. Some of these are already one-act or multi-act plays, and some have strong dramatic elements that can be adapted into plays. If these texts are "three-dimensionalized" and brought to the stage, making them visually tangible, it would greatly benefit middle school students' language learning.

In the past year or two, several places such as Zhejiang and Fujian have simultaneously turned their attention to language arts textbooks, adapting and performing "textbook plays." Last year, Tianjin also had students perform "textbook plays." The Beijing People's Art Theatre has also planned to produce a complete set of textbook play video tapes. I believe this is a new and noteworthy development in the theater world. Clearly, good things that meet the needs of the people will spread widely without being promoted, and textbook plays will become increasingly popular.

I have watched two textbook plays with middle school audiences. The theater effect was excellent. Even if some adaptations were not ideal, every character and every plot development were familiar to the young audience. They greeted them like old friends on the street. However, they did not take it lightly because theater was still new to them. I asked two young viewers, and they said they had never seen a play before. They were very interested to see characters they knew from their textbooks come to life on stage. Especially in some poignant comedic scenes, such as Fang Jin's madness in "The Scholars," the experience is something that cannot be gained from just reading the text. The youth gained a deeper understanding of the text and were exposed to a new art form, truly a win-win situation.

For theater troupes, adapting and performing textbook plays is also beneficial. The Fujian Provincial Drama Troupe started early and staged two performances, performing over fifty shows in about a month in various schools. The performance I saw by the Zhejiang Provincial Drama Troupe was invited by the education department of the city of Juxi, and a small city wanted to perform four or five dozen shows. A provincial drama troupe, if it performs in five to ten counties or cities in the province each year, with an average of 25-50 shows per location, this would be an exciting figure in terms of attracting new audiences, increasing the practical experience of directors and performers, and generating revenue.

However, producing good textbook plays is not a simple matter. It seems that each play is only twenty or thirty minutes long, the original works are literary classics, the roles are not too many, and the plots are not too complex, so it seems that a bit of tweaking would make it a play. In fact, this is not the case. Whether it is "The Scholars," "The Necklace," "The Emperor's New Clothes," or "The Policeman and the Poet," there are various ways to adapt and perform them. Precisely because they are classics, how to reveal their profound thoughts in a short time, create character images, and develop literary plots into dramatic plots—all require deep skills in writing, directing, and acting. The two performances I saw were not perfect. Moreover, middle school textbooks span six grades, with significant differences between them, and special attention must be paid to the target audience.

Textbook plays and related art forms (such as essay and poetry recitations, skits, etc.) are a systematic project that must be given attention and significant effort. There are still many issues to be discussed and resolved, which I cannot cover one by one here. I believe the most important thing is to first draw the attention of the theater and education circles to textbook plays. I hope that the importance of textbook plays can be included in the current efforts to strengthen education work, and that it can be firmly established and popularized.

### 要高度重视“课本剧”

　　要高度重视“课本剧”
    刘厚生
    中学语文课本中选收了不少世界文学名著。有的是短篇小说或散文，有的是长篇选粹。其中有些本身就是独幕剧或多幕剧的选场，有些很富于戏剧性可以改编为戏。如果把这些课文“立体化”，搬到舞台上演出，使之具有形象的直观性，对于中学生的语文学习，岂不是大有好处？
    近一两年来，浙江、福建等好几个地方的话剧院团都不约而同地把眼光投向了语文课本，编演了“课本剧”。天津市去年也曾由学生组合上演过“课本剧”。北京人民艺术剧院也已经有计划地摄制了一整套课本剧的录像带。我以为这是戏剧战线上值得高度重视的新生事物。很明显，适应群众需要的好东西不用推就能广，课本剧将日益流行起来。
    我曾和中学生观众一起看过两场课本剧。剧场效果好极了。有的剧本改编得即使不够理想，但每一个人物出来，每一个情节进展，少年观众都是熟悉的，他们像在路上遇见好朋友那样热烈招呼。然而他们又决不因为熟悉而轻忽，因为话剧对他们又是生疏的。我曾问过两个小观众，他们说从来没有看过话剧。他们看到在课本上认识的人竟然在舞台上活了起来，大感兴趣。特别是某些令人辛酸的喜剧性场面，比如《范进中举》中范进发疯的表演，其感受是读课文时得不到的。少年们更深地理解了课文，又接触了新的文艺样式，实在是一举数得。
    对于剧团，编演课本剧也是有利无害之事。福建省话剧团搞得比较早，他们排了两台剧目，在约一个月中就在各学校演出了五十多场；我看浙江省话剧团那一场，正巧诸暨市教委负责人来邀请，一个小城市就要演四五十场。一个省剧团，如果每年在本省内跑５到１０个县市，每个地方平均演２５—５０场，这在争取新观众、增加编导演员演出实践以及创收等方面，都将是何等令人兴奋的数字。
    然而搞好课本剧决不是简单的事。看起来，每出戏不过二三十分钟，原著都是文学名著，角色不太多，情节不太复杂，似乎揉揉搓搓即可成戏。其实大谬不然。无论是《范进中举》、《项链》、《皇帝的新衣》或者《警察与赞美诗》……都可以有各种各样的改编方法和演出方法。正因为是名著，如何在很短时间里发掘其思想深意，塑造出性格形象，使文学情节发展为戏剧情节，编、导、表演，都是需要甚深的功力的。我看的两台节目中，就还不能说每一个都编得很完善。况且中学课本跨六个年级，彼此距离很大，还要特别注意观众的针对性。
    课本剧以及与之相关联的某些文艺样式（如散文诗词朗诵、小品等等）是一项必须重视必须投入很大力量的系统工程。还有不少有待讨论和解决的问题，我这里不可能一一述及。我觉得最重要的是首先要引起话剧界和教育界对课本剧的高度关注。我希望能把对课本剧的重视列入当前加强教育工作应办的实事中去，踏踏实实地使其扎根下去，普及开来。
