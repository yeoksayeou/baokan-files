		Increase in Five Types of Cases in Beijing
		Main Issues Include Property Crimes, Transient Crimes, and Cross-Border Crimes

		Reported by Zhang Shuzheng for this newspaper: In recent years, Beijing's public security situation has been severe, with significant increases in five types of cases: property crimes, transient crimes, and cross-border crimes.

		There has been an increase in individuals entering units or residential areas to commit robberies, thefts, and fraud. Last year, cases of this nature, which primarily target property, accounted for 75% of Beijing's major criminal cases, an increase of 50% compared to the previous year.

		Transient crimes are also quite serious. Among the city's 1.31 million transient population, a significant number are transient criminals or individuals who pose a threat to public security. Last year alone, 1,175 individuals from outside the city were caught committing theft on public buses and trains. In recent years, in key bustling areas, 80% of the individuals caught for illegal activities have been from outside the city. Some individuals from other provinces, who are dissatisfied with society, specifically come to Beijing to cause trouble and create incidents. Transient individuals, including those who petition without reason, vagrants, and individuals with mental illnesses, pose a certain threat to Beijing's public security order.

		Cross-border crimes and illegal immigration cases have increased. Last year, 15 individuals from abroad were caught using fake passports, fake credit cards, fake traveler's checks, fake Renminbi, and fake foreign currency to commit crimes, most of whom have backgrounds in organized crime. This reflects the infiltration of foreign organized crime groups and criminal syndicates into mainland China. The capital's airport border inspection station caught 27 cases of illegal immigration involving 80 individuals, an increase of 42.8% compared to the previous year.

		Social vices persist despite repeated bans. Last year, the city caught cases of prostitution, gambling, and the spread of obscene materials, which increased by 17%, 43%, and 37% respectively compared to the previous year. These phenomena, which corrupt social morals and directly induce crimes, continue to occur frequently.

		The danger posed by recidivism among released prisoners and individuals whose re-education through labor has been lifted is severe, and juvenile crimes are prominent. A small number of released prisoners and individuals whose re-education through labor has been lifted, who have not been truly reformed, continue to commit crimes with brutal methods and malicious intent. Last year, 1,066 such criminal individuals were caught, many of whom were responsible for major and important cases.

		To maintain the capital's social order, the public has called for relevant departments to fulfill their duties in severely cracking down on criminal elements.

　　北京五类案件增多    
    存在问题主要是侵犯财产、流窜犯罪、入境犯罪
    本报讯  记者张书政报道：近年，北京治安形势严峻，侵犯财产、流窜犯罪和入境犯罪等５类案件增多。
    潜入到单位或居民区的院、楼、室内抢劫、盗窃、诈骗的作案者增多。去年，以侵犯财产为目的的这类案件，占北京重大刑事犯罪案件的７５％，比前年增加５０％。
    流窜犯罪相当严重。该市目前１３１万流动人口中，混杂着相当数量的流窜犯或危害治安分子。去年，仅在公共电、汽车上抓获的外地扒窃分子就有１１７５名。近年来在重点繁华地区抓获的违法犯罪人员中，外来人口一直占８０％左右。有些外地的对社会不满的人，专程到北京闹事，制造事端。流动人口中的上访无理取闹人员、盲流和精神病患者，对北京治安秩序构成一定威胁。
    入境犯罪和偷引渡案件增加。去年查获使用假护照、假信用卡、假旅行支票、假人民币、假外汇等进行犯罪活动的境外人员１５名，大都有黑社会背景，这是境外黑社会势力和犯罪团伙向我国大陆渗透的反映。首都机场边防检查站去年查获偷引渡案件共２７起８０人次，比前年人数增加４２．８％。
    社会丑恶现象屡禁不止。去年，该市查获卖淫案、赌博案和传播淫秽物品案，分别比前年增加１７％、４３％和３７％。这些败坏社会风气、直接诱发犯罪的丑恶现象，目前仍屡屡发生。
    刑满释放、解除劳教人员重新犯罪危害严重，青少年犯罪突出。少数没有得到真正改造的刑满释放和解除劳教人员，继续作案，手段残忍，性质恶劣。去年共查获这类犯罪分子１０６６人，不少大案、要案都是他们干的。
    为维护首都社会治安，广大群众呼吁，有关部门对违法犯罪分子应切实履行严厉打击的职责。
