A beloved and respected leader has passed away.

Where did he go?

— To Jiangxi's Gongqing City.

On April 28, 1989, Hu Deping and Li Heng, carrying their father's wishes and their family's instructions, came to the banks of Lake Poyang and Mount Fuyang to choose the final resting place for Hu Yaobang.

Before his passing, during a casual conversation at home, Hu Yaobang mentioned his wishes for after death: "When I die, I don't want to be buried at Babaoshan. I hope that the green mountains and clear waters of Gongqing City can be my eternal resting place." The speaker had his heart set on it, and the listener took it to heart. His wife, Li Zhao, carefully remembered these words.

On April 15, Hu Yaobang passed away, and these words became his will. Soon, Li Zhao conveyed his wishes to the people of Gongqing City, who were quite familiar with Hu Yaobang and his family. This is how Hu Yaobang's ashes came to be placed in Gongqing City.

The news spread, and officials and the public from Hu Yaobang's hometown in Hunan and places where he had worked, such as Shaanxi, seemed somewhat disappointed. They requested that part of his ashes be buried in his hometown and the places where he had worked diligently for many years. Li Zhao understood their feelings but, after explaining the situation, she still followed Hu Yaobang's wishes and decided to bury his ashes in Gongqing City.

The news that Hu Yaobang would rest eternally in Gongqing City excited the people of Gongqing City. They knew that without Hu Yaobang's care and encouragement during his lifetime, there might not have been this new reclamation city on Chinese soil, nor the thriving youth work here. Some old reclamation team members heard that Hu Yaobang's family considered the country's economic difficulties and advocated for a simple funeral, and they eagerly offered to donate money for their beloved person. They also hoped that Hu Yaobang could be buried in the best place in Gongqing City. Soon after the memorial service for Hu Yaobang was held in Beijing, the secretary and governor of Jiangxi Province came to Gongqing City and prepared several potential sites for Hu Yaobang's grave.

On April 28, it rained, and under the accompaniment of leaders from the Central Office and the Jiangxi Provincial Committee, Hu Yaobang's son, Hu Deping, and daughter, Li Heng, first came to the center of Gongqing City, a hill originally planned to be a park. The scenery here was beautiful, with lush green trees and verdant grass, and a pearl-like lake shimmering with ripples, truly a pleasant place for rest and relaxation.

In the hearts of the people of Gongqing City, this was the best place for Hu Yaobang to rest! However, without even inspecting the site, Hu Deping and Li Heng rejected this location. Li Heng said, "Father was always afraid of harming the interests of the people during his lifetime, and even after death, he shouldn't compete with the people for land. It's better to keep this place as a park for the people."

The group left the city center and went to several nearby hills. They saw dense, dark green cypress forests everywhere, all carefully greened. Looking at the trees on the mountain, the scene of Hu Yaobang and the first generation of reclamation team members living in thatched huts, lighting bonfires, and clearing land to plant trees seemed to appear before their eyes. Now the trees towered into the sky, and the green shade was like a canopy, as if ready to welcome the soul of the person most deserving of peace. Unexpectedly, several lush hills were not approved by Hu Yaobang's family. They believed: "Building a tomb on a green mountain would inevitably require cutting down some trees. Although Father loved nature and trees, to destroy existing trees for a deceased person, he would feel uneasy in his heart."

People held umbrellas and walked through the muddy red soil, continuing to search for a suitable site within the 42-square-kilometer area of Gongqing City. When they reached a place about two li east-southeast of the city, a 40-meter-high barren mountain appeared in the valley. According to the De'an County Gazetteer, it is called Mount Fuyang. Standing on the mountain top, Lake Poyang stretched endlessly, and Gongqing City was in full view.

"This place is good, let's choose here!" Hu Deping and his sister looked around and almost simultaneously said. Some people thought it was too desolate. However, Hu Yaobang's family insisted, saying, "It's okay, choosing the grave here won't destroy the forest, and it will also help with the greening of this area."

The grave site was decided on this barren hill. Hu Deping and Li Heng, following their father's wishes, announced on the spot their hopes and requirements for building Hu Yaobang's grave: The country's economy is facing difficulties, and the scale of basic construction is being reduced, so there should be no large-scale construction for the father's grave; During his lifetime, the father's burden was already heavy enough, and after death, there should be no memorial halls, museums, or other buildings weighing on him; The father was a liberated person during his lifetime, and he hoped that after death, he would not be confined by a tomb made of marble or reinforced concrete, but only need to bury his ashes deep in the ground, letting him merge with the land that had nurtured him; There is no need to erect a high tombstone on the ground, just a bust, the base does not necessarily need an inscription, but carve the emblems of the Young Pioneers, the Communist Youth League, and the Communist Party, symbolizing his revolutionary life from joining the Children's Corps, the Communist Youth League, to the Communist Party; If considering that someone might come to pay their respects, a memorial pavilion can be built to provide shade and shelter from the rain.

The relevant personnel from the Central Office and the Provincial Committee were deeply moved by these expressions of Hu Yaobang's wishes. If Lake Poyang and Mount Fuyang had consciousness, they would also be deeply touched by the affection of this great man after his death.

### 身后一片情依旧——胡耀邦墓择址记

　　身后一片情依旧   
    ——胡耀邦墓择址记
    本报记者  魏亚南
    一位可亲可敬的领导人去了。
    去向何方？
    ——江西共青城。
    １９８９年４月２８日，胡德平、李恒带着父亲的宿愿和家人的嘱托，来到鄱阳湖畔、敷阳山上，为胡耀邦选择最终的归宿。
    耀邦逝世前，一次偶然的家中聊天，他谈起了自己身后的愿望：“我死了，不想到八宝山去。我希望共青城的青山绿水能成为长眠的地方。”说者有心，听者有意，夫人李昭真真切切地记下了这句话。
    ４月１５日，耀邦逝世，这句话竟然成了他的遗嘱。很快，李昭便把他的这一宿愿转告了对耀邦及其一家相当熟稔的共青人。这便是耀邦骨灰安置共青城的来历。
    消息传出，胡耀邦老家湖南和曾经任职过的陕西等地干部群众似乎有些失落感。他们请求把一部分骨灰也安葬在耀邦家乡及多年辛勤工作过的地方。李昭理解这种心情，但她多方解释后，仍遵照耀邦的心愿，决定骨灰安葬共青城。
    耀邦要到共青城永远安息的消息，使共青人感奋不已。他们清楚地知道，如果没有耀邦生前的关怀和鼓励，中国大地上也许不会有这个新兴的垦殖城，不会有这里朝气勃发的共青事业。一些老垦荒队员听说耀邦家属考虑国家经济困难，主张丧葬从简，纷纷要求为他们所挚爱的人解囊捐款，同时希望能将耀邦安葬在共青城最好的地方。北京举行耀邦追悼大会后不久，江西省委书记、省长就来到共青城，为耀邦墓地预备了几个选址。
    ４月２８日，天公作雨，在中央办公厅、江西省委领导人的陪同下，胡耀邦的大儿子胡德平、女儿李恒首先来到了共青城中心，一处原计划辟为公园的山岗。这里风光秀丽，绿树娉婷、芳草滴翠，一汪珍珠湖波光粼粼，真是个宜人的休憩胜地。
    在共青人心里，耀邦安息在这里再好不过了！然而，德平、李恒不用踏勘，便否定了这个选址。李恒说：“父亲生前最怕侵害群众利益，死后也不能与人民争地。不要因父亲墓地改变共青城的规划，这里还是留给人们作公园更合适。”
    一行人离开城中心，来到周围几座山岗，只见处处黑绿的杉木林郁郁葱葱，都是精心绿化过的。人们望着山上的树木，当年耀邦与第一代垦荒队员住茅棚，点篝火，开荒种树的情景宛若眼前。如今大树参天，绿荫如盖，仿佛正在准备接纳这位最有资格安享宁静的灵魂。不料，几处苍翠的山岗都没被耀邦家人认可，他们认为：“在绿化过的山上修墓，免不了砍掉一部分树木。爸爸虽然钟爱大自然，喜欢树木，但为了一个死去的人破坏已有的树木，他心里会不安的。”
    人们打着雨伞，踏着泥泞的红土地，在方圆４２平方公里的共青城范围内继续选址。走到城东南两华里的地方，山坳中间一座高４０多米的荒山呈现在人们面前，据德安县志记载它叫敷阳山。登上山顶，鄱阳湖一望无际，共青城尽收眼底。
    “这里很好，就选这里吧！”德平与妹妹环顾左右几乎异口同声地说。对于这意外的决定，有人认为太荒凉。耀邦的家人却坚持说，不要紧，墓地选在这里不至于毁林，还会有助于这一带的绿化。
    墓址，定在这荒山岗上。德平、李恒依照父亲生前的意愿，又当场宣布了建造胡耀邦墓地的希望与要求：国家经济困难，正在压缩基本建设规模，不能因父亲墓地大兴土木；在世时，父亲的负担已经够重了，死后不要把灵堂、纪念馆等建筑物压在他身上了；父亲生前是个解放了的人，他希望死后也不要被大理石或钢筋混凝土建造的墓穴缚住，只须将骨灰深埋地下，让他与养育过自己的土地融合到一起；地面不必竖立高大墓碑，塑个半身像，基座不一定要碑文，刻上少先队、共青团和共产党的徽志，象征他从参加儿童团、共青团到共产党的革命一生；如果考虑到有人要来凭吊，可修一遮阴避雨的纪念亭。
    在场的中办和省委有关人员激动地记录了这些反映耀邦意愿的倾述。如果鄱阳湖、敷阳山有知，也会被这位伟人身后的情意所深深打动。
