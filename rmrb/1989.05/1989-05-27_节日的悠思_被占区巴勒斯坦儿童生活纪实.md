In front of me lies a shocking piece of material: in the first year of the Palestinian people's uprising against the occupation, more than half of the Palestinians killed or injured by the occupying forces in the Gaza Strip were minors and children. According to reports, in the first 12 months of the uprising, 11,449 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip were killed or injured by Israeli occupying forces. Among all the casualties, 58% were under the age of 15.

On April 23 of this year, during a mass demonstration in the Daraj region of the Gaza Strip, 33 Palestinians were injured by Israeli soldiers, 24 of whom were minors and children. Among the injured children, one was 4 years old, two were 6 years old, and one was 8 years old.

The above incidents occurred in the Gaza Strip. What about the situation in the West Bank? I also have some material on this: on a Tuesday in November 1988, 5-year-old Dia Hajj Muhammad was shot and killed by Israeli soldiers near his home in Naples. The occupying forces fired three shots at little Dia, hitting him in the abdomen, and he died shortly after.

Israeli soldiers also use plastic bullets against Palestinian children. A publication by a United Nations agency featured a photograph of a Palestinian mother holding a baby boy who was not yet two weeks old. His left eye was wide open, staring forward, while his right eye was just a drooping eyelid. The caption read: "The child's eye was blown out by a plastic bullet." The young mother turned slightly to the camera, her head held high, her expression a mix of strength and a hint of sorrow.

Israeli soldiers also use a "new type" of weapon to harm Palestinian children, which is explosive devices disguised as candy. They throw the "candy" to the children, and if a child picks it up, they will be blown up on the spot or severely injured.

There are always two sides to every story. Oppression inevitably leads to resistance. The occupying authorities' aggressive actions not only provoke resistance from adult Palestinians but also educate children to quickly understand who to love and who to hate. According to a report in the winter 1988 issue of the Palestinian women's magazine _Fangxin_ from the occupied territories, the uprising struggle has left a clear imprint in the hearts of the children, making them more politically mature than children in other places. The uprising has become the most important daily matter for the children. The magazine interviewed some parents and teachers in the occupied territories, and all interviewees agreed that the uprising has quickly turned children into adults. One elementary school teacher said: the uprising has made children forget they are children. Their gaze no longer holds childish innocence but is filled with challenge and pride. Another educator said that the questions children ask after watching TV news show their "adult-like" thinking. For example, six or seven-year-old children might ask if Shamir is "our" prime minister, "Why are only Arabs dying in the demonstrations?" "Why do soldiers have guns while masked youths do not?" ...

The parents interviewed said that the children's favorite game is what they call the "soldiers and masked youths" game. Some children "hold demonstrations" and "throw stones," while others use toy guns to "drive them away." The interview also showed that children prefer watching TV news over cartoons. Their political growth is also evident in that when they hear their parents boycotting Israeli goods, they will ask the shop owner: "Is this box of cookies made in Israel or Palestine?"

Palestinian children are not afraid of death or imprisonment. On May 8 of this year, a foreign newspaper reported the story of a 14-year-old "stone-throwing veteran" in the Rafah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. A girl named Jamala was injured three times in the anti-occupation struggle. She was injured the third time while trying to rescue a boy who was being beaten. The 17-month uprising has turned her into a strong young patriot. She always stands at the front of the line during stone-throwing battles. She said: "We have been waiting for this uprising for a long time." Her neighbor has a 6-year-old girl who was shot in the head by Israeli soldiers with a rubber-coated steel bullet because she ran to tell the stone-throwing youths: "The Israeli soldiers are coming to beat them."

The Palestinian children in the occupied territories are the most unfortunate group of children in the world. Their bravery and political maturity are rare among children in other countries. They are the flowers of the Palestinian nation, representing the hope and future of Palestine.

　　节日的悠思
    ——被占区巴勒斯坦儿童生活纪实
    陈佩明
    在我面前摆着一份令人惊骇的材料：在巴勒斯坦人民发动反占领起义斗争的第一年里，在加沙地带被占领军打死打伤的巴勒斯坦人中，有一半以上是少年和儿童。据公布，加沙地带巴勒斯坦人在起义的头１２个月里，一共被以色列占领军打死打伤１１４４９人。而在所有死伤者中，年龄不满１５岁的人占５８％。
    今年４月２３日，在加沙地带达拉杰地区举行的一次群众示威中，有３３名巴勒斯坦人被以色列士兵打伤，其中２４人是少年和儿童。受伤的儿童中有一个４岁，两个６岁，一个８岁。
    以上是发生在加沙地带的事情。那么在约旦河西岸情况又怎样呢？我手头也有一份材料：１９８８年１１月的一个星期二，５岁的狄亚·哈吉·穆罕默德在那不勒斯附近的家门口被以色列士兵开枪打死。占领军向小狄亚连开３枪，击中腹部，不久身亡。
    以色列士兵还用塑料子弹对付巴勒斯坦儿童。一个联合国机构出版的刊物登载了这样一幅照片：一位巴勒斯坦妈妈怀里抱着一个不足两周岁的小男孩，他的左眼溜滚圆地瞪视着前方，右眼却只是耷拉着的眼皮。照片说明：“这小孩的一只眼睛被塑料子弹打掉了。”年轻的妈妈侧身对着镜头，微微昂起头，坚强中带着几分哀伤的表情。
    以色列士兵还使用一种“新型”武器来伤害巴勒斯坦孩童，这就是伪装成糖果的爆炸装置。他们把“糖果”扔给孩子，若有小孩去捡拾，便会被当场炸死或炸伤。
    事情总有两面。有压迫，就必然有反抗。占领当局的侵略行径不仅激起成年巴勒斯坦人的反抗，也教育孩子迅速懂得爱谁和恨谁。据１９８８年冬季一期被占区巴勒斯坦妇女杂志《芳馨》报道，被占区人民的起义斗争在孩子们心里刻下了清晰的记印，使他们比任何其他地方的孩子在政治上更趋早熟，起义就成了孩子们最为关心的日常事情。这家杂志对被占区一些家长和教师进行了采访，被采访者一致认为，起义使孩子们很快变成了成年人。一位小学教师说：起义使孩子忘了自己是孩子。他们的目光已不再散发稚气，而是充满着挑战和自豪的神情。另一位教育工作者说，孩子们在看电视新闻后问的一些问题表明了他们的“成人化”。举例说，六、七岁的孩子会问沙米尔是不是“我们的”总理？“为什么在示威中死去的都是阿拉伯人？”“为什么士兵有枪而蒙面青年没有枪？”……
    被采访的家长们说，孩子们最喜爱玩的游戏是他们叫做“士兵和蒙面年轻人”的游戏。一些孩子“举行示威”和“扔石块”，另一些孩子则用玩具枪去“驱赶他们”。这次采访还表明，孩子们最爱看的是电视新闻而不是动画片。他们在政治上成长快还表现在，当听到家长在抵制以色列货时，他们会问店铺老板：这盒饼干是以色列制造的，还是巴勒斯坦制造的？
    巴勒斯坦孩子不怕死，不怕坐牢。今年５月８日，一家外国报纸报道了加沙地带拉法难民营里一个１４岁的“扔石头老战士”的故事。一个名叫贾玛拉的小姑娘，在反占领斗争中先后负过３次伤。她是在去营救一个正在遭殴打的男孩时受第三次伤的。１７个月的起义斗争使她变成了坚强的小爱国志士，她在每次扔石块斗争中总是站在队伍的前列。她说：“我们等待这场起义已经很久了。”她邻居有个６岁的女孩，被以色列士兵用包着橡皮的钢弹射伤了头部，因为她跑去告诉扔石块的青年：以色列士兵来打他们了。
    被占区巴勒斯坦儿童是世界上遭遇最不幸的一部分儿童，他们的勇敢和政治上的成熟在世界各国儿童里是不多见的。他们是巴勒斯坦民族的花朵，代表着巴勒斯坦的希望和未来。
