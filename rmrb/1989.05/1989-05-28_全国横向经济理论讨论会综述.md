The National Horizontal Economic Theory Discussion Conference, jointly organized by the Chinese Society for Science and Technology Economics, the Institute of Quantitative and Technological Economics of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Jiangsu Provincial Economic Cooperation Committee, and the Economic and Technological Cooperation Office of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, was held in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu Province, at the end of March. The attendees believed that holding this conference under the current situation of rectification, adjustment, and deepening of reforms is of great significance for improving the theory of horizontal economics, guiding the practice of horizontal economics, and further promoting the coordinated and stable development of the national economy.

The representatives reviewed the development of horizontal economic cooperation over the past decade and unanimously agreed that the rise of horizontal economics is a major event in China's social and economic life. Under the guidance of the policy of "opening up to the outside world and invigorating the economy," the horizontal economic ties, exchanges, and cooperation between regions, departments, enterprises, regions and departments, and domestic and overseas entities have been continuously strengthened. This has broken through the self-contained natural economy and product economy pattern, playing a significant role in vigorously developing socialist planned commodity economy, developing productive forces, establishing and improving the market mechanism, optimizing economic structure, and promoting system reform.

I. On the Meaning of Horizontal Economics

During the discussion, the representatives proposed several views. One opinion holds that in China, horizontal economic ties have always existed in economic activities but were artificially severed by the vertical management system under the single planned economy. The meaning of horizontal economics can be generally expressed as: the rational flow and optimal combination of production factors and asset stocks that were vertically separated under the single planned economy, based on breaking through the segmented and blocked regional barriers.

A second opinion holds that horizontal economics is not a general term for the cooperation and collaboration activities between production entities under any economic form, but is relative to vertical economics. The meaning of horizontal economics is not only about the cooperation and collaboration between enterprises but also about the economic exchanges between regions based on the expansion of local financial and material resources as the state's mandatory planning shrinks. Due to the uneven distribution of resources and the different characteristics of regional economic development, local governments must widely carry out economic and technological cooperation among themselves in organizing regional economic activities. Therefore, this horizontal economics is actually a comprehensive manifestation of regional economic exchanges. The meaning of horizontal economics is a form of economic activity in which a province or region, based on its local advantages, exchanges production factors with the outside world on an equal and mutually beneficial basis to achieve the development of its own economy.

A third opinion holds that horizontal economics, from the perspective of its activities, is hierarchical, and the understanding of horizontal economics should also have broad and narrow distinctions. Enterprise cooperation and collaboration activities exist under the single planned management system, but they are organized according to vertical management methods, thus restricting or hindering the autonomous cooperation and collaboration of enterprises as the main body. At the same time, the highly centralized vertical management system suppresses the initiative of local governments, making regional economic activities with local governments as the main body also restricted. These two forces are released in the reform process, forming the two main contents of the current horizontal economics.

II. On the Relationship Between Developing Horizontal Economics and Rectification, Adjustment, and Deepening of Reforms

Many comrades pointed out that developing horizontal economic cooperation is a transmission mechanism for promoting the modernization of government functions and the marketization of the commodity economy. However, the realization of this reform goal is not possible in one step. Under the national conditions where the degree of marketization is low and government intervention in economic activities is mainly through direct control, the unavoidable question in promoting reform is how to find a transitional way and a transformation mechanism that connects the realistic starting point of reform with the target model, so that the modernization of government functions and the marketization of the commodity economy can approach the reform goal simultaneously. First of all, developing horizontal economics does not exclude government participation and control of economic activities. On the contrary, it emphasizes the correct use of various administrative and economic regulatory measures by the government to start from adjusting market relations and promoting the development of the market system. At the same time, in the transformation of government functions, it emphasizes replacing vertical control and direct control with horizontal services and indirect control; in the allocation of resource factors, it respects market laws and regional comparative advantage principles, while also accepting the macro guidance of national economic development plans and industrial policies. Therefore, developing horizontal economics reflects the intrinsic unity of government regulation and market orientation, reflecting the logical sequence of reform progress.

The development of horizontal economics is conducive to adjusting the economic structure and increasing effective supply, which is a positive factor in the current process of rectification, adjustment, and deepening of reforms. It can overcome the non-optimal combination of production factors on the basis of combining administrative intervention and market regulation, and maintain the stable growth of economic construction through the adjustment and optimization of economic structure that fits the reality. In analyzing the deep-seated causes of the non-optimal combination of production factors, the representatives pointed out that one is the market vacancy, market signal deviation, and lag, which induce investment misplacement; the other is the short-term behavior of the government, regional division, and blockage, leading to the coexistence of resource shortages and stagnation. Therefore, it is especially important to emphasize the development of horizontal economics to break and reorganize this abnormal economic pattern.

III. On the Theory and Policy Research of Horizontal Economics

The representatives believed that the development of horizontal economics is a product of reform, opening up, and invigorating the economy. Horizontal economic practice has promoted the development of cooperative productive forces, thereby promoting the development of the economy and society, and also bringing about changes in people's values. Therefore, it is necessary for the theoretical community to pay attention to and participate in the research of horizontal economic theory and policy, especially to strengthen the research on the laws of horizontal economics based on investigation and research, so that horizontal economic decision-making has a solid theoretical foundation. At the same time, it is necessary to advocate the combination of theory and practice, and overcome the phenomenon of theoretical workers being detached from horizontal economic practice. The current focus of horizontal economic theory work should be to seriously summarize the practical experience of horizontal economic development over the past decade of reform, and analyze and expound the laws of horizontal economic movement with Chinese characteristics.

　　全国横向经济理论讨论会综述
    任晓平　韩洪青
    由中国技术经济研究会、中国社会科学院数量经济与技术经济研究所、江苏省经济协作委员会和浙江省政府经济技术协作办公室联合主办的全国横向经济理论讨论会于３月底在江苏省镇江市召开。与会代表认为，在当前治理、整顿和深化改革的新形势下召开这次会议，对于完善横向经济理论、指导横向经济实践、进一步促进国民经济的协调稳定发展，必将产生积极而又深远的影响。
    代表们回顾了十年来横向经济联合的发展历程，一致认为横向经济的兴起是我国社会经济生活中的一件大事。在“对外开放、对内搞活经济”的方针指引下，我国地区之间、部门之间、企业之间、地区与部门之间、国内与海外之间的横向经济联系、交流与合作的不断加强，冲破了自我封闭的自然经济和产品经济格局，对于大力发展社会主义有计划商品经济、发展社会生产力、建立和完善市场机制、优化经济结构、促进体制改革，发挥了巨大作用。
    一、关于横向经济的含义。
    与会代表在讨论中提出了几种看法：一种意见认为，在我国，横向经济联系也是历史上经济活动中固有的，只不过是在单一计划经济条件下被纵向管理体制人为割断了。关于横向经济的含义大体上可以表述为：把单一计划经济条件下被纵向割裂的生产要素和资产存量，在冲破条块分割、地区封锁的基础上进行合理流动和优化组合的经济活动。
    第二种意见认为，横向经济不是泛指在任何经济形态下生产主体之间的联合与协作活动，而是相对纵向经济而言的。横向经济的含义不仅单指企业间的联合与协作，更要注意到在国家指令性计划缩小、地方财力物力扩大基础上出现的地区之间的经济交往。由于资源分布的不均衡和地方经济发展的不同特点，地方政府在组织地区经济活动中，必然要广泛开展相互间的经济技术合作。因此，这种横向经济实际上就是地区经济交往的综合表现形式。横向经济的含义是，一省或一地区依托本地优势，在平等互利基础上与外部进行生产要素的交换以达到发展自身经济的目的一种经济活动方式。
    第三种意见认为，横向经济从其活动内容上考察是分层次的，对横向经济的理解也应有广义和狭义之分。企业联合与协作活动在单一计划管理条件下是存在的，只不过是依据纵向管理手段来组织，从而使企业为主体的自主联合与协作受到了纵向管理的制约或阻碍。同时，以高度集中为特征的纵向管理体制压抑了地方的积极性，使地方政府为主体的区域经济活动也受到了束缚。这两种力量在改革过程中释放出来，形成了当前横向经济的两个主要内容。
    二、关于发展横向经济与治理整顿、深化改革的关系。
    许多同志提出，发展横向经济联合是推进政府职能现代化和商品经济市场化的传动机制。但是，这一改革目标的实现不可能一步到位。在市场化程度很低、政府对经济活动干预还是以直接调控为主要方式的国情条件下推进改革，不容回避的问题是怎样寻找改革的现实起点与目标模式相联系的过渡方式和转轨机制，使得从政府职能现代化与商品经济市场化这两个方面能够并行不悖地逼近改革目标。首先，发展横向经济并不排斥政府对经济活动的参与和调控。相反，它极为强调政府正确运用各种行政的和经济的调节手段，从调整市场关系出发、促进市场体系的发育。同时，在政府职能的转换方面，它强调以横向服务、间接调控来取代纵向统制、直接调控；在资源要素配置方面，它既尊重市场规律、区域比较利益原则，又接受国民经济发展计划和产业政策的宏观指导。因此，发展横向经济体现了政府调控和市场导向双重职能的内在统一，体现了改革推进的逻辑顺序。
    横向经济的发展有利于调整经济结构、增加有效供给，是当前治理整顿和深化改革过程中的积极因素，它能在行政干预和市场调节相结合的基础上不断克服生产要素的非优化组合，通过切合实际的经济结构的调整与优化来维护经济建设的稳定增长。与会代表在分析生产要素非优化组合的深层原因时指出，一是市场虚置、市场信号的偏差和滞后，诱导了投资错位；二是政府行为短期化、区域割据和条块封锁导致了资源短缺与滞存现象并存。因此，目前应特别强调通过发展横向经济来打破并重组这种畸形发展的经济格局。
    三、关于横向经济理论和政策研究。与会代表认为，横向经济的发展是改革、开放、搞活的产物，横向经济实践促进了协作生产力的发展，进而促进了经济社会的发展，也带来了人们价值观念的变化。因此，需要理论界关心和参与横向经济理论与政策研究，特别是在调查研究基础上加强横向经济规律性研究，使得横向经济决策具有坚实的理论基础。同时，应当提倡理论联系实际，克服理论工作者与横向经济实践脱节现象。当前横向经济理论工作的重点应当是认真总结改革十年来横向经济发展的实践经验，分析阐述具有中国特色的横向经济运动规律。
