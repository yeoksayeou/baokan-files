Only in the wasteland do I truly enjoy the sun, which is vastly different from the sunlight experienced in urban dwellings. The sunlight in the wasteland is pure and healthy. Even at dusk, it is sincerely radiant and magnificent, exuding a dreamy softness and love. Urban sunlight, however, is always tinged with a sense of illness: it seeps through windows and door cracks, falling on the floor and walls, mingling with artificial light and the melancholic expressions of the inhabitants, creating a scene of weariness and emptiness. In the city, sunlight and people, along with their surroundings, are almost completely separated. People either pray to the sun or curse it—sunlight and people are completely estranged, discordant, as if one culture exists within another. In the wasteland, everything—rocks, withered trees, grass, springs—exudes the essence and character of sunlight. This inseparable, indescribable beauty is both intense and subtle, both fundamental and natural. Even the shadows of mountains and boulders make one feel the cool movement and state of the sun. People living in the wasteland always determine their lives based on the sun’s rays and position. More ancient tribes have even more mysterious and heart-stirring reactions to the sun, facing it and revealing their innermost selves, achieving lofty and tragic deeds! Yes, there, the sun and human existence and destiny are one. Or rather, the sun itself is life, father, and lover. On their bodies, pottery, temples, simple furniture, and caves, they are filled with sun-like decorations and moods. Hymns, ballads, and religious rituals praising the sun are also common. In this beautiful and moving mystery, there is so much health and purity!

To describe the sun in the wasteland as "abundant" is far too weak! Naturally, it is abundant and rich, but it is far more than that. To say it is fresh, powerful, and splendid is still not enough. Only a shepherd who has been soaking in the sunlight on the hillsides for years can be more convincing. His wrinkles, dirt, and worn-out sheepskin jacket are all results of the sun’s washing. His loneliness, silence, his outward stupidity but inner warmth, are all deep imprints of the sun. At this moment, I feel my writing is useless; the pen cannot flow with the radiant sunlight of the wasteland. Not only does the text lack such luster and brilliance, but even the most sensitive and creative painters and photographers can only sigh, be intoxicated, forget themselves, and forget to express. The human brain is too small, and the wasteland is boundless; the human heart is mottled and cluttered, while the wasteland is pure and refined. To enjoy the sunlight of the wasteland, one must go deep into the wasteland. But this is impossible; few people are willing to give up comfort and enter the wandering, beauty, and freedom of the wasteland. Even those who are accustomed to the wasteland and deeply love it from the heart will eventually leave it and forget it. Throughout human history, from nomadic to agricultural, and then to industrial and information ages, we have created rich and varied light sources and energy. In various artificial lights, we have long forgotten the essence of light, just as those who are immersed in the colorful stage lights never experience a true sunrise or sunset. From a practical standpoint, they no longer need the dazzling light that bursts from the mountain peaks, oceans, and wastelands. They have more convenient and direct enjoyment. Sunlight to them is like a legend, something they can never touch even in their dreams. But the pain of homesickness permeates everything, forming the deepest tragedy of the human spirit. The complex and subtle relationship between humans and the wasteland is like the complex and subtle relationship between humans and themselves. It can be said that only those who have an intense feeling for sunlight can be called true humans, healthy humans, like Vincent van Gogh’s "Sunflowers," where the feeling for sunlight and the feeling for life are completely unified. One day, people will walk out of the darkness and return to complete sunlight. And this is precisely what Vincent van Gogh, with his passion, dreams, and love, has given us—a shudder. He is immortal. No one has shone with such life and flame in the intense sunlight!

　　荒原上的太阳   
    ——题文森特·凡高的《向日葵》
    只是在荒原，我才享受到真正的阳光，与在城市的居室所感受到的迥然不同。荒原上的阳光是纯洁、健康的，即使在黄昏日落时，也无比的赤诚、辉煌，散发着梦幻的柔和与爱；城市的阳光则总带着病态：透过窗棂或门缝，落在地板上、墙壁上，与人工的灯光，主人忧郁的神情交织在一起，一派的倦庸与空虚！……在城市，阳光与人及其环境几乎是分离开的，人对于太阳，要么是祈求、祷告，要么是诅咒、怨恶——太阳与人彻底隔膜，互不和谐，仿佛一种文化处于另一种文化中；在荒原则完全不同，荒原上的一切：石头、枯树、草、泉水，无不透出阳光的气息和个性，那融合在一起，不可分解的美，实在太浓烈又太散淡，太本质又太自然了！即便是大山的阴影、巨石的阴影，也让人感到凉爽的太阳的运动和状态。生活在荒原上的人，总是根据太阳的光芒、方位来决定自己的生活，更久远一些的部落，对于太阳的反应，则更为神秘和震撼人心，人们面对太阳剖白自己，作出了种种崇高、悲壮的业绩！是的，在那里，太阳与人的生存、命运合而为一，或者说太阳本身就是生命、父亲和爱人了。他们在自己的身体上、陶器制品上、庙宇里以及简陋的家具上、洞穴中，布满了拟日的文饰和情调。颂日的诗歌、谣曲、宗教仪式，则更为屡见不鲜。在这美丽动人的大神秘里，包含了多少健康与纯真！
    用“充足”来描述荒原上的太阳实在太轻了！自然，它是充足和丰富的，但远不止于此，说它新鲜、强大、美奂美仑，都远不及一个长年浸泡在山坡上的牧羊人更具说服力，他的皱纹、污垢，衰老的羊皮背心，无不是阳光浆洗的结果，他的孤独、沉寂，他的外表呆痴而内含热力，都是阳光的深刻烙印。此刻，我感到自己文笔的无用，笔尖是流不出荒原那样光彩夺目的阳光来的；不仅是文字缺乏这样的色泽光芒，最敏感和最具创造力的画家、摄影家，恐怕也只有感叹、沉醉，忘掉自己、忘掉表达……人脑太小而荒原无限；人心斑驳、陈杂，而荒原纯净、精粹。要享受荒原上的阳光，只有亲自到荒原深处去。但这不可能，没有几个人愿意放弃安乐，走进飘泊、美和自由中去。即使那些习惯荒原，从内心深处热爱荒原的人，最终也会离开它，淡忘它。整个人类从游牧到农业，再进入工业、信息时代，创造了丰富多姿的各种光源和能量，在各式各样的人造光里，早已忘记光的本体，正如沉湎舞台五光十色中的人，从来不会体验到一次真正的日出日落一样，从功用上讲，他们已不需要从山尖上、海洋中、荒原里迸发出的夺目光彩了，他们有了更为方便和直接的享受，阳光对于他们真仿佛传说，哪怕在梦中也不会触摸得到的。但怀乡的痛苦，贯彻始终，构成了人类精神最深刻的悲剧。人与荒原之间复杂微妙的关系，正如同人与自身的复杂微妙。完全可以说，只有对阳光有着无比感受的人，才可称之为真正的人，健康的人，像文森特·凡高的《向日葵》那样，对于阳光的感受和对于生活的感受是完全统一在一起的。总有一天，人们会走出黑暗，回到完全的阳光中去。而这，正是文森特·凡高用自己的激情、梦幻和爱恋所给予我们的震颤。他是不朽的，还没有人像他那样在剧烈的阳光中闪耀着生命的情调和光焰！
