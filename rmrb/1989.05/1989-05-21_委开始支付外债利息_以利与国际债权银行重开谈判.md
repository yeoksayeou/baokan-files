Venezuela begins paying foreign debt interest
To facilitate negotiations with international creditor banks

CARACAS, May 20 (Xinhua) — Venezuela recently paid nearly $400 million in overdue foreign debt interest, marking the first time the Perez government has paid such interest since taking office in February.

Since the beginning of this year, Venezuela has suspended payments on the principal of its foreign debt. Shortly after taking office in early February, President Perez announced the suspension of interest payments as well. Financial experts believe that Venezuela's decision to resume paying interest on its foreign debt is motivated by two considerations. First, this move aims to prevent Venezuela's credit rating from being downgraded to "loan delinquency." Second, Venezuela's previous negotiations with international banks on its debt had not made significant progress. With the introduction of the Brady Plan, Venezuela plans to resume negotiations with creditor banks based on this plan. By paying interest before the negotiations begin, Venezuela demonstrates goodwill, which is conducive to a positive negotiating atmosphere.

　　委开始支付外债利息
    以利与国际债权银行重开谈判
    本报加拉加斯电  记者朱满庭报道：委内瑞拉于最近支付了一笔近４亿美元的拖期外债利息，这是佩雷斯政府自２月份执政后第一次支付外债利息。
    从今年年初起委内瑞拉已暂停支付外债本金，２月初，佩雷斯总统就职后又宣布暂停支付利息，金融界人士认为，委内瑞拉开始支付外债利息有两方面的考虑。首先，这样做是为避免委内瑞拉的借贷信用被列入“贷款迟纳”一档中。其次，委内瑞拉与国际银行的债务谈判前一时期没有取得进展，布雷迪计划提出后，委内瑞拉将根据这一计划与债权银行重开谈判，委内瑞拉在谈判开始前支付利息，有利于谈判气氛，是良好意愿的表示。
