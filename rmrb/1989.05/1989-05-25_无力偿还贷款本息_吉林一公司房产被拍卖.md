A property mortgaged by Jilin Building Materials Company was recently auctioned off in Zhuhai, Guangdong, to repay debts owed to the Zhuhai Branch of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC).

In May 1988, Jilin Building Materials Company, based in Zhuhai, borrowed 10 million yuan from the Zhuhai Branch of CITIC to purchase steel, with a repayment period of three months. The company mortgaged a newly constructed four-story building as collateral. Both parties signed a property mortgage loan contract, which was notarized by the Zhuhai Notary Office.

In August 1988, when the loan was due, Jilin Building Materials Company was unable to repay the principal and interest and delayed repayment. During this period, the company was pursued by more than 10 creditors, owing a total of approximately 70 million yuan, and was unable to repay the debts.

In January of this year, the Zhuhai Branch of CITIC reported to the Zhuhai Municipal Judicial Bureau, requesting legal enforcement of the mortgaged property to clear the debts. After legal procedures, on March 28, the Zhuhai Intermediate People's Court, based on the notarization by the Municipal Notary Office allowing enforcement, publicly auctioned off the debtor's 2,681.8 square meters of building area at a starting price of 25 million yuan. The highest bid of 32 million yuan was won by Zhuhai Dazhou Petrochemical Company. The creditor, the Zhuhai Branch of CITIC, was first to receive repayment of the loan principal and interest, as well as overdue penalties totaling 12.2 million yuan.

　　无力偿还贷款本息
    吉林一公司房产被拍卖
    新华社广州５月２５日电  （记者张才龙、通讯员王中标）吉林建材公司抵押的房产，前不久在广东珠海被强制执行拍卖，以偿还中国银行珠海信托咨询公司债务。
    １９８８年５月，设在珠海市的吉林建材公司，向中国银行珠海信托咨询公司贷款１００万元人民币购买钢材，为期３个月，以新建的４层楼房作抵押。双方在珠海市司法局公证处办理了《房产抵押贷款合同》公证书。
    １９８８年８月，吉林建材公司贷款到期后无能力偿还本息，并借故一拖再拖。在此期间，这家公司还先后被１０多家债权人追债，欠款人民币约７００多万元，已无能力偿还所欠债务。
    今年１月，中国银行珠海信托咨询公司向市司法局报告，要求对债务人吉林建材公司抵押的房产依法强制执行，清偿债务。经过法律程序，３月２８日，珠海市中级人民法院根据市公证处《准许强制执行》公证书，将债务人吉林建材公司的２６８１．８平方米建筑面积的楼房，以底价人民币２５０万元公开拍卖，最后以人民币３２０万元的最高价，由珠海市大洲石油化工公司中标。债权人中国银行珠海信托咨询公司优先得到偿还贷款本息及超期罚息人民币１２２万多元。
