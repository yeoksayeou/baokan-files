	Indonesia and Portugal Resume Talks on East Timor

	Our correspondent Liu Kaicheng reported from the United Nations on May 9: Under the chairmanship of UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Indonesian representative Sutresna and Portuguese representative Reino resumed substantive talks on the East Timor issue here today.

	The UN spokesman said the purpose of this round of talks is to discuss the conditions, timing, and other necessary arrangements for the visit of the Portuguese parliamentary delegation to East Timor.

	The island of East Timor, formerly under Portuguese colonial rule, has been a long-standing point of contention between Portugal and Indonesia within the UN. Indonesia maintains that the island has exercised its right to self-determination and decided to merge with Indonesia, but Portugal opposes this stance, and the UN has not agreed.

　　印尼葡萄牙再议东帝汶问题
    本报联合国５月９日电  记者刘开宸报道：在联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔的主持下，印尼代表苏特雷斯纳和葡萄牙代表雷诺今天在这里恢复了关于东帝汶问题的实质性会谈。
    联合国发言人说，此次会谈的目的是讨论葡萄牙议会代表团访问东帝汶的条件、时间及必要安排的其他几个方面。
    东帝汶岛，曾在葡萄牙殖民统治下，是联合国内葡萄牙和印尼多年争论的问题。印尼认为该岛已行使自决权，并决定与印尼合并，但葡萄牙反对此立场，联合国也未同意。
