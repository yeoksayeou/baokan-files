In the history of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev, compared to past Soviet leaders, can be considered a person with new ideas and a new style of work and life.

Gorbachev was born on March 2, 1931, in the village of Privolnoe in the Stavropol Krai (equivalent to a state-level region in the Soviet Union). His grandfather and father were both laboring farmers. In 1941, the Nazi German army launched a large-scale invasion of the Soviet Union, and by the winter of 1942, they had occupied the city of Stavropol. The war brought heavy shadows to the lives of the Soviet people. Gorbachev once had to stop attending elementary school because he had no shoes to wear. His father, who was fighting on the front lines, wrote a letter home instructing his wife to sell some of their belongings to buy shoes for the child so that he could continue his studies. Post-war rural life was still very difficult. When Gorbachev was in middle school, he spent half his time studying and the other half working in the fields. During holidays, he would work as a temporary laborer at the agricultural tractor station or assist on the harvesters. The agricultural machinery at the time was very poor, and there was not even a driver's cabin. In the summer heat, the tractor drivers would sweat profusely, and in the harsh winter, the young Gorbachev would often shiver from the cold. The harsh working environment tempered Gorbachev's tenacious fighting spirit. Due to his outstanding performance, in 1949, at the age of 18, Gorbachev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.

In 1950, Gorbachev was admitted to Moscow University to study law. During his university years, in addition to studying diligently, he also served as the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch of the law department. According to Soviet publications, he had been interested in national affairs since an early age, was good at listening to others' opinions, and had independent views. In 1952, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After graduating from university in the summer of 1955, Gorbachev returned to his hometown of Stavropol to work in the leadership of the Communist Youth League and the Party for 23 years. During this period, he was elected as a representative to the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU. As the first leader of the regional party organization, Gorbachev paid great attention to connecting with the masses. He would walk to the office every morning, chatting with people along the way, understanding the situation, and discussing issues. The Stavropol Krai was an important grain-producing region in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's measures, such as appropriately expanding the farmers' private plots, adjusting the organization of agricultural labor, and promoting advanced agricultural science and technology, led to consecutive bumper harvests and were well-received. This region had a famous spa resort, and Soviet leaders such as Brezhnev, as well as Gorbachev's fellow countrymen Andropov and Suslov, would sometimes come here for vacations. Gorbachev's work achievements and style left a deep impression on these leaders.

In November 1978, Gorbachev was transferred to Moscow to serve as a secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. In 1979, he was elected as an alternate member of the CPSU Politburo, and in October 1980, he was promoted to a full member. At that time, in the highest echelons of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev was the youngest leader.

In the first half of the 1980s, various contradictions in Soviet society were increasingly exacerbated. From November 1982 to March 1985, three major Soviet leaders, Brezhnev, Andropov, and Chernenko, died in succession, and the funeral dirges repeatedly stirred people's thoughts and worries about the fate of the country. On the day after Chernenko's death, an extraordinary plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee was convened, and Gorbachev was elected as the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. On October 1, 1988, Gorbachev also took on the position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

After taking office, Gorbachev immediately began a profound political and economic system reform. In the reform, he believed that the image of a party leader must eliminate characteristics such as "overly bureaucratic, bureaucratism, lordly manner, and seeking fame and fortune," and instead cultivate virtues such as "bravery, initiative, high ideological standards, pure morality, unity with the people, and the ability to defend the spiritual wealth of socialism." Under his leadership, the Soviet Union has taken a series of major steps in the reform process. Soon after becoming the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee in 1985, Gorbachev convened the April Plenary Session of the Central Committee, clearly proposing the need to implement reforms and accelerate socio-economic development. The 27th Congress of the CPSU held in the spring of 1986 determined the strategy for accelerating socio-economic development in the Soviet Union by the end of the century and the policy of implementing fundamental reforms. The January 1987 Plenary Session decided to make democratization the main driving force and the fundamental guarantee for the irreversibility of the reform. The June 1987 Plenary Session also adopted the "Basic Principles for Fundamental Economic Management Reform" and other resolutions, outlining the basic blueprint for the Soviet economic reform. Subsequently, the Soviet Union passed various resolutions and laws and amended the constitution, providing important legal guarantees for the implementation of economic and political reforms. All of this laid the foundation for Gorbachev's reforms in theory and practice. Around this time, Gorbachev also proposed a series of new ideas based on this reform thinking for various aspects of work, including Soviet foreign affairs, and named it the "New Thinking."

To win support for the reforms, Gorbachev frequently met and dialogued with people from all walks of life in society and often visited various places in the Soviet Union, directly going to factories, mines, villages, hospitals, shops, and streets to talk with people from all professions and discuss national affairs together. Gorbachev also actively advocated openness, stressing that "we should tell the truth to the people and not be afraid of our own people"; "without openness, there is no reform, without openness, there is no democracy." Many foreign observers pointed out that this is the area where there have been the most significant changes in Soviet social life in recent years.

Gorbachev also paid attention to his own and his family members' influence in society. His father has passed away, and his mother still lives in the old home in the village of Privolnoe, like other elderly farm members, relying on her pension to live, and she also raises some chickens and a cow to supplement her income. Gorbachev visits his hardworking mother every year. It is said that Gorbachev's daughter Irina and her son-in-law Anatoly are both doctors. Gorbachev occasionally goes to the "Moscow" restaurant for lunch, and when he and Raisa go to the theater, they also sit in the ordinary audience seats.

Gorbachev also timely adjusted the Soviet foreign policy, proposing a series of suggestions on disarmament, resolving regional conflicts, and improving relations with other countries, which attracted international attention. He visited many countries and, through various means, promoted international dialogue and pushed the international situation towards easing. In particular, the Soviet-American Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan according to the Geneva Agreement, and the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally reduce its military by 500,000 all, to some extent, reflected Gorbachev's new thinking.

Of course, the reforms under Gorbachev's leadership still face severe tests. As many foreign media comments have pointed out, the Soviet reform process is encountering "great difficulties," such as unrest in ethnic minority regions, uneven economic development, shortages of consumer goods, and obstruction by conservative forces, all of which need to be addressed. Gorbachev himself also admits that the resistance to reform is great, and the most difficult problem is overcoming the inertia of old thinking. He believes that "reforms cannot retreat and have no way to retreat"; reforms are a long-term process that requires time, patience, perseverance, and continuous exploration. Although there are many difficulties, reform is the driving force for the development of the Soviet Party and state and is in line with the wishes and demands of the Soviet people. Therefore, people hope that the Soviet reforms will succeed.

　　苏联新型的领导人　戈尔巴乔夫
    王崇杰
    在苏联历史上，戈尔巴乔夫同过去苏联领导人相比，可以算得上一位具有新型思想和工作生活方式的人。
    戈尔巴乔夫１９３１年３月２日出生于北高加索斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区（相当于苏联的州一级）的普里沃尔诺耶村，祖父和父亲都是劳动农民。１９４１年纳粹德国军队大举入侵苏联，１９４２年冬天占领了斯塔夫罗波尔市。战乱给苏联人民的生活带来重重阴影，戈尔巴乔夫曾一度由于没有鞋穿不能继续上小学。正在前线作战的戈尔巴乔夫的父亲写信回家，让妻子卖掉家中的东西给孩子买鞋，以使他能上学。战后农村的生活仍非常艰苦，戈尔巴乔夫上中学时，一半时间学习，一半时间下田劳动，每逢假期就到农业拖拉机站当临时工，或在收割机上当助手。当时的农机设备很差，甚至连驾驶室也没有。炎夏时节农机手汗如雨下，而隆冬则寒风凛冽，年轻的戈尔巴乔夫常常被冻得浑身发抖。艰苦的劳动环境锻炼了戈尔巴乔夫坚韧的奋斗精神。由于表现突出，１９４９年戈尔巴乔夫１８岁时就荣获劳动红旗勋章。
    １９５０年戈尔巴乔夫考入莫斯科大学，在法律系深造。大学期间，他除刻苦攻读，并担任法律系的团支部书记。据苏联报刊介绍，他很早就关心国家大事，善于听取别人意见又具有独立见解。１９５２年他加入了苏联共产党。
    １９５５年夏天大学毕业后，戈尔巴乔夫返回故乡斯塔夫罗波尔市从事共青团和党的领导工作长达２３年。其间他先后当选为苏共２２大的代表、苏联最高苏维埃代表和苏共中央委员。作为边疆区党组织的第一把手，戈尔巴乔夫很重视联系群众。他每天清晨总是步行到机关去上班，一路上同人们交谈，了解情况，讨论问题。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区是苏联全国的重要产粮区，戈尔巴乔夫根据具体情况而采取的一些措施，如适当扩大农民的宅旁园地、调整农业劳动组织和推广先进农业科学技术等，使农业接连丰收，得到好评。这个边疆区有全国闻名的矿泉疗养地，苏联领导人勃列日涅夫，以及戈尔巴乔夫的同乡安德罗波夫和苏斯洛夫，也时而前来度假。戈尔巴乔夫的工作成绩和思想作风，在这些领导人中留下深刻的印象。
    １９７８年１１月戈尔巴乔夫被调到莫斯科担任苏共中央书记处书记。１９７９年他又当选苏共中央政治局候补委员，１９８０年１０月升任政治局委员。当时在苏联的最高领导层，戈尔巴乔夫是最年轻的领导成员。
    ８０年代前半期，苏联社会的各种矛盾不断加剧。从１９８２年１１月至１９８５年３月，苏联三位主要领导人勃列日涅夫、安德罗波夫和契尔年科先后病逝，国葬的哀乐一次又一次地引起人们对国家命运的沉思和担忧。在契尔年科逝世第二天即召开的非常苏共中央全会上，戈尔巴乔夫被推选为苏共中央总书记。１９８８年１０月１日戈尔巴乔夫又兼任苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席的职务。
    戈尔巴乔夫上台后，立即着手进行一场深刻的政治和经济的体制改革。在改革中，他认为，作为一个党的领导人的形象，必须铲除“官气十足、官僚主义、老爷作风和沽名钓誉等特征”，而代之以“勇敢、主动、高度的思想性、纯洁的道德、同人民打成一片、善于捍卫社会主义的精神财富等品德”。在他的领导下，苏联在改革的进程中已采取一系列重大步骤。１９８５年戈尔巴乔夫担任苏共中央总书记不久就召开了４月中央全会，明确地提出必须实行改革和加速社会经济发展的指导思想。１９８６年春召开的苏共２７大，确定了苏联到本世纪末的加速社会经济发展战略和实行根本性改革的方针。１９８７年１月全会决定把民主化作为改革的主要动力和改革不可逆转的基本保证。同年６月全会又通过了《根本改革经济管理的基本原则》及其他决议，为苏联经济改革制定了基本蓝图。此后，苏联又通过多种决议和法律，并修改了宪法，为实施经济和政治改革提供了重要的法律保证。所有这一切都为戈尔巴乔夫实行改革从理论和实践上奠定了基础。在此前后，戈尔巴乔夫还依据这种改革的思想，对各方面的工作，包括苏联的外交工作，提出了一系列新的设想，并名之为“新思维”。
    戈尔巴乔夫为了赢得人们对改革的支持，经常同社会各界人士会晤和对话，同时也常到苏联各地访问，直接到工厂、矿区、农村、医院、商店和街头同各行各业的人交谈，共同商讨国家大事。戈尔巴乔夫还积极倡导公开性，强调“应该向人民讲真话，不要害怕自己的人民”；“没有公开性就没有改革，没有公开性就没有民主”。不少外国观察家指出，这是近几年苏联社会生活中变化最大的领域。
    戈尔巴乔夫也很注意自己及家庭成员在社会上的影响。他的父亲已经去世，母亲仍居住在普里沃尔诺耶村的老家，像其他年老的农庄庄员一样靠退休金维持生活，并且自己还饲养一些鸡和一头奶牛来补贴家用。戈尔巴乔夫每年都回家探望勤劳的母亲。据说戈尔巴乔夫的女儿伊莲娜和女婿阿纳托里都是医生。戈尔巴乔夫偶尔还到“莫斯科”餐厅去吃午饭，他同赖莎到剧院看戏时也坐在普通的观众席上。
    戈尔巴乔夫还及时调整了苏联的外交政策，就裁军、解决地区性冲突和改善苏联同其他国家关系提出了一系列建议，在国际上引起注意。他访问了不少国家，通过各种方式开展国际对话，推动国际局势转向缓和。特别是苏美签订的销毁中导条约、根据日内瓦协议苏军全部撤出阿富汗和苏联决定单方面裁军５０万等，都在一定程度上反映了戈尔巴乔夫的新思维。
    当然，戈尔巴乔夫领导下的苏联改革，目前仍面临着严峻的考验。诚如外电许多评论指出的那样，苏联改革进程中正遇到“巨大困难”，诸如少数民族地区的动乱、经济发展不平衡、消费品短缺和保守势力阻挠等问题都有待解决。戈尔巴乔夫自己也承认改革阻力很大，最困难的问题是克服旧思维的惰性。他认为改革“不能后退，也无路可退”；改革是个长期的过程，需要时间、耐心、坚持不懈和不断的探索。尽管困难不少，但改革乃是苏联党和国家发展的动力，是符合苏联人民群众的意愿和要求，因此人们希望，苏联的改革能取得成功。
