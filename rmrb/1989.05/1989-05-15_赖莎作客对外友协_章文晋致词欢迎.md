Raisa Visits the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
	Chapter Wenjin Welcomes Her

	Beijing, May 15th - Today, Raisa Gorbacheva, the wife of CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev, despite her fatigue from the journey, rested briefly upon arriving in Beijing and then proceeded to the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries. There, she attended a tea party hosted by the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the China-Soviet Friendship Association to welcome her.

	Raisa wore a white suit with black fine lines today, her face was rosy, and she appeared full of vigor. After getting off the car in front of the building of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, she shook hands with the Chairman of the China-Soviet Friendship Association, Wu Xiuquan, the Chairman of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, Chapter Wenjin, and the wife of Premier Li Peng, Zhu Lin, who had been waiting there for a long time. She also greeted them in Chinese, saying, "Hello! Thank you!"

	At the tea party, Chairman Chapter Wenjin spoke first, praising Raisa and other Soviet guests for their valuable support for people-to-people friendship work.

	Despite having injured her waist on the plane, Raisa Gorbacheva still stood up from her seat at the tea party to address the attendees who had long been working hard for the cause of Sino-Soviet friendship. At the beginning of her speech, she introduced the more than ten writers, composers, academicians, Sinologists, directors, film actors, and party workers who had come with her to the tea party one by one, and asked them to stand by her side. Raisa attributed the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations to the joint efforts of the leaders and peoples of the two countries. She said that many people, under any circumstances, had defended and maintained our friendship, mutual understanding, and respect, and protected the mutual interests of the peoples of the two countries. She expressed her respect and gratitude for this.

	At the tea party, old friends met again, and hands clasped tightly for a long time. New friends, meeting for the first time, exchanged business cards excitedly and left addresses. Raisa Gorbacheva stood in the middle of the reception room, smiling and taking photos with batches of Chinese friends, signing for them as a keepsake.

	At the tea party, Chairman Chapter Wenjin, on behalf of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and the China-Soviet Friendship Association, presented Raisa with a Chinese jewelry box with a red lacquer finish and a cabinet-like design. Raisa reciprocated with a unique vase made of Ural gemstones and, at the invitation, inscribed a message for the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries.

　　赖莎作客对外友协    
    章文晋致词欢迎
    本报北京五月十五日讯  记者蒋千红报道：今天下午，苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫的夫人赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃不顾旅途的劳累，在到达北京后稍事休息，便来到中国人民对外友协，参加对外友协、中苏友协为欢迎她而举行的茶话会。
    赖莎今天身着白色配以黑色细线条的西装套裙，面色红润，显得朝气勃勃。在对外友协楼前下车后，她同在那里恭候良久的中苏友好协会会长伍修权、中国人民对外友协会长章文晋和李鹏总理的夫人朱琳愉快地握手，并学着用中文说：“你好！”“谢谢！”
    茶话会上，章文晋会长首先致词，他称赞赖莎和其他苏联客人的光临是对民间友好工作的宝贵支持。
    尽管在飞机上不慎扭了腰，在茶话会上，赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃仍然从座位上站起来，向与会的长期为中苏友好事业辛勤工作的各界人士致辞。在讲话开始的时候，她亲切而又熟悉地将同她一起来参加茶话会的十余位作家、作曲家、科学院院士、汉学家、导演、电影演员和党的工作者一一介绍给与会者，并请他们站在自己的身边。赖莎把中苏关系的正常化归结为两国领导人和人民共同努力的结果。她说，许多人在任何情况下保卫并保持了我们的友谊、相互理解与尊重，保护了两国人民的相互利益。在此，她表示敬意与谢意。
    茶话会上，老朋友们再次会面，一双双紧握的手久久不肯松开，新朋友初次相识，兴奋地交换名片，留下地址。赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃站在会客室的中间，含笑与一批批中国朋友合影，为他们签名留念。
    茶话会上，章文晋会长代表对外友协和中苏友协，将一个红漆涂面、仿柜式的中国首饰盒送给赖莎，赖莎回赠了一个用乌拉尔宝石制作的别致花瓶，并应邀为对外友协题词。
