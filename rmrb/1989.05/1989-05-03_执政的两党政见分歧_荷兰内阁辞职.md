On the night of May 2, Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers announced the government's resignation and submitted his resignation to Queen Beatrix the following morning. Thus, the second Lubbers government, formed by the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy, has dissolved.

The downfall of this government was due to disagreements between the two ruling parties over an environmental protection plan. On April 29, the coalition government passed this plan, intending to allocate 7.3 billion guilders over the next five years for environmental protection. To raise part of the funds and reduce environmental pollution, the government planned to increase taxes on motorists. The leader of the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy strongly opposed this plan, arguing that it directly harmed the interests of taxpayers. Prime Minister Lubbers decided to submit the plan to the parliament for debate. During the May 2 parliamentary session, due to the parties' unwillingness to compromise, the prime minister resigned in frustration before the vote of confidence.

This cabinet was formed in July 1986 and had one year left in its term. According to local media estimates, new elections may not be held until this autumn.

　　执政的两党政见分歧    
    荷兰内阁辞职
    本报布鲁塞尔５月３日电  记者魏崴报道：５月２日夜间，荷兰内阁首相吕贝尔斯宣布政府辞职，并在今天上午向贝娅特丽克丝女王提交辞呈。这样，由基督教民主联盟与自由民主人民党联合组成的吕贝尔斯第二届政府遂告解体。
    导致本届政府垮台的，是联合执政的两党在环境保护计划上的分歧。４月２９日联合政府通过了此项计划，准备在今后５年中，拨款７３亿荷盾用于环保。为筹集部分经费和减少环境污染，政府打算提高驾驶汽车者的税收。自由民主人民党领导人坚决反对这项计划，认为它直接损害了纳税人利益。吕贝尔斯首相决定将计划提交议会辩论。在５月２日的议会上，由于两党互不相让，未等信任投票，首相即愤而挂冠。
    本届内阁是在１９８６年７月组成，离任期期满尚有１年时间。据此间新闻界估计，新的选举可能要到今秋才会举行。
