On January 24, the 258th train from Changsha to Zhengzhou in Henan Province slowly pulled into Miluo Railway Station. An elderly man with silver hair, named Tian Ronghua, stepped off the train. Mr. Tian had gone to Taiwan 40 years ago and was now returning to visit his 80-year-old mother. However, on the 258th train, he lost a black suitcase containing gold and silver jewelry, as well as Hong Kong dollars and US dollars, totaling approximately 100,000 yuan. Upon learning of the situation, the staff at Miluo Railway Station immediately organized a search effort along the route from Changsha to Miluo, checking each station for Mr. Tian's lost suitcase. When the suitcase containing the valuable items was returned to Mr. Tian, he was overcome with emotion, his eyes welling up with tears, and he repeatedly expressed his gratitude.

On the morning of January 27 at 9:30, the 116th train from Xi'an to Liuzhou stopped at Miluo Railway Station. At this time, a pregnant woman named Bao Zhiyue from Hubei in the 8th car suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain and was about to give birth. After the train conductor contacted the station, the station's passenger service staff, including Yang Zhihua, quickly brought a stretcher and took the pregnant woman to Miluo City People's Hospital. Yang Zhihua also paid for Bao Zhiyue's registration and handled her hospital admission procedures. At 11:00 AM, the woman gave birth to a healthy baby girl. A few days later, Yang Zhihua personally ensured that Bao Zhiyue and her daughter returned to their hometown by sleeper train. The Bao family was deeply moved and wrote a letter of thanks saying, "Without the care and support of the staff at Miluo Railway Station, the child would not have been born safely, and the mother's life would have been in danger!"

On February 7 (the second day of the Lunar New Year), Wu Guikang and his family of 11 from Xiangyin County were heading to Pingxiang City, Jiangxi Province, to visit relatives. They missed their train at Miluo Railway Station. This group of 11, including elderly and young members, could not stay at the cold station. When Wu Guikang's family was at a loss, Deputy Stationmaster Wang from Miluo Railway Station arrived. He immediately discussed with the ticket sellers to find a solution and chose the best travel plan for them. According to the instructions from the station staff, Wu Guikang's family successfully reunited with their relatives on the same day.

　　汨罗火车站文明待客二三事
    提包失而复得
    １月２４日，由长沙开往河南郑州的２５８次列车徐徐驶进汨罗车站。车上下来一位满头银发的老人，名叫田荣华。田先生４０年前去了台湾，现在是辗转回来探望８０高龄的老母亲的。可是，在２５８次列车上，他丢失了一个黑色提包，内有金银首饰及港币、美元，折合人民币约１０万余元。汨罗火车站的同志得知情况后，立即组织力量，在长沙至汨罗间沿途各站查找田先生丢失的提包。当装有贵重物品的提包重新回到田先生手里的时候，田荣华激动的热泪盈眶，连连道谢。
  列车上的产妇
    １月２７日上午９点半，西安开往柳州的１１６次列车停靠在汨罗车站。这时第８车厢一位名叫鲍志伟的湖北孕妇突然腹痛难忍，即将临产。列车长和车站联系后，车站客运员杨志华等人迅即找来担架，将孕妇送到汨罗市人民医院。杨志华还自己掏钱，替鲍志伟挂号，并为她办理了住院手续。上午１１点，产妇顺利生下一女孩。几天以后，杨志华又亲自关照鲍志伟母女乘卧铺回了老家。鲍志伟全家非常感动，他们写来感谢信说：“要不是汨罗火车站同志的关怀照顾，孩子不可能安全降生，大人的生命也难保啊！”
  最佳乘车方案
    ２月７日（农历大年初二），湘阴县广播局吴桂康一家１１人到江西萍乡市探亲，在汨罗火车站误了乘车时间。这一行１１人，老的老、小的小，天寒地冻在车站滞留显然不行。吴桂康一家正在不知所措之时，汨罗火车站王副站长来了，他立即与售票员商量，为他们想办法，并选择了最佳乘车方案。按照车站的同志为他们指引的改乘车次，线路，吴桂康一家于当天顺利和亲友团聚。
