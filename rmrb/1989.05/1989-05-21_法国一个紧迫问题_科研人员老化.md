The High Council for Scientific Research in France recently released a report indicating that as the entire country's population ages, France's scientific research workforce is also aging rapidly. This situation poses a serious threat to France's technological development. If no timely measures are taken, it will inevitably have dire consequences for France's industry and the entire national economy.

France possesses a robust scientific and technological force and is at the forefront of the world in fields such as nuclear energy, aerospace, and telecommunications. Statistics show that France currently has 310,000 scientific researchers, accounting for 1.29% of the workforce. Looking at the age distribution of researchers, between 1950 and 1970, those under 40 years old accounted for more than 60% of the total, making it the most vibrant period in France's scientific community. In the 1980s, the proportion of researchers in this age group dropped to less than 40%.

Currently, the average age of French researchers is 43 years. The most creative period for researchers is between 25 and 35 years old. It is predicted that if no effective measures are taken in the next 10 years, such as increasing the proportion of young researchers in research institutions and adjusting policies for researchers, the average age of French researchers will reach 45.5 years. Among them, those over 50 years old will increase from the current 22% to 37%.

To address this issue, the French Ministry of Research plans to allocate special funds from the 1989 budget to attract some young scientific talents, aiming to increase the proportion of young researchers entering the research field from the current 3% to 5% annually. To make the age structure of France's research workforce more reasonable, 8% of the workforce needs to be "renewed" each year. However, due to budget constraints, this goal is difficult to achieve in the coming years.

Currently, the French government has not made a decision on how to address the aging of the research workforce. However, to reverse this trend, the High Council for Scientific Research suggests establishing a "restrictive committee" consisting of 3 to 6 technical personnel to conduct an in-depth investigation into the current problems in the scientific community. The goal is to propose innovative solutions. The committee believes that solving the aging problem should not be pursued one-sidedly for youthfulness but should address the fundamental issues facing the scientific community.

　　法国一个紧迫问题——科研人员老化
    常国兵
    法国高等科研委员会最近的一份报告指出，随着整个国家人口老化的加剧，法国科研队伍亦日趋老化，这一状况已对法国科技的发展构成严重威胁，如不及时采取措施，势必“对法国工业乃至整个国家经济带来可怕的后果”。
    法国拥有雄厚的科技力量，在核能、航空和电讯等技术领域居世界领先地位。据统计，法国现有各类科研人员３１万人，占从业人口的１．２９％。从科研人员的年龄状况来看，１９５０—１９７０年期间，年龄在４０岁以下的科研人员占科研人员总数的６０％以上，是法国科技界“最富朝气的年代”。８０年代，上述年龄层次的科研人员的比例已下降到不足４０％。
    目前，法国科研人员平均年龄达４３岁。科研人员最富有创造力的年龄为２５—３５岁。据预测，在未来１０年中，如不采取有效措施，诸如科研机构增加年轻科研人员比例、调整对科研人员的政策等，那么，法国科研人员的平均年龄将高达４５．５岁，其中５０岁以上的科研人员将从目前占科研人员总数的２２％上升至３７％。
    针对上述问题，法国科研部计划从１９８９年预算中拨出专款，以吸收部分年轻的科研人才，使每年进入科研部门的青年科研人员从现在的仅占科研人员总数的３％提高到５％。要使法国科研队伍的年龄构成趋于合理，每年必须有８％的比例来“换血”。然而，由于经费所限，近几年还难以做到。
    目前，法国政府还未就解决科研队伍老化问题做出决定。不过，为了扭转老化局面，法国高等科研委员会建议，成立由３至６名科技人员组成的“限制性委员会”，就科技界目前存在的问题进行深入细致的调查，以期提出有新意的解决方案。该委员会认为，解决老化问题不能片面追求年轻化，而应从根本上解决科技界面临的问题。
