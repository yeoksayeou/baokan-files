The Ministerial Meeting of the Coordination Bureau of the Non-Aligned Movement concluded at 9 PM tonight. The meeting adopted a special declaration on the issue of Namibia and a resolution to accept Venezuela as a member of the Non-Aligned Movement. It also approved the draft political declaration submitted by the Political Committee and the draft economic declaration submitted by the Economic Committee. These two declarations will be submitted for review at the Ninth Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement to be held in Belgrade in September.

The attending foreign ministers expressed great concern over the situation in Southern Africa, particularly in Namibia. They pointed out that South Africa continues to refuse to act in accordance with certain provisions of Resolution 435, especially failing to withdraw its troops back to their bases, which is the main obstacle to the implementation of the plan for Namibia's independence.

Shamuyarira stated that South African troops have killed many members of the South West Africa People's Organization. If South African troops remain in Namibia, refugees will not be able to return. They fear being killed by South African troops.

The meeting conducted extensive discussions on the situation in the Middle East. The attending foreign ministers believed that the Palestinian issue must now be submitted to the Security Council for review to formulate a clear plan.

In discussing the situation in Afghanistan, the foreign ministers noted that after the Soviet troops withdrew on February 15, internal fighting in Afghanistan still occurs from time to time. They expressed disappointment over this. They called on all parties involved in the conflict to seek political solutions rather than military ones, as military solutions are not viable. They will cause serious economic losses, destroy people's lives and property, and devastate the country.

The conference also conducted extensive discussions on major international economic issues such as the world economic situation, negotiations to establish a new international economic order, international development strategies, external debt, and development.

A total of 85 member countries and organizations of the Non-Aligned Movement participated in the meeting. Venezuela, Brazil, Mexico, Mongolia, and the Philippines attended the meeting as observers.

　　不结盟协调局外长会议闭幕
    通过纳米比亚问题特别宣言
    接受委内瑞拉为不结盟成员
    本报哈拉雷５月１９日电  记者李景卫报道：不结盟国家协调局外长会议于今晚９时闭幕。会议通过关于纳米比亚问题特别宣言和一项接受委内瑞拉为不结盟运动成员国的决议，并通过政治委员会提交的政治宣言草案和经济委员会提交的经济宣言草案，这两个宣言草案将提交９月份在贝尔格莱德举行第九次不结盟运动首脑会议审议。
    与会外长们对南部非洲、尤其对纳米比亚的局势非常关注。他们指出，南非继续拒绝按照４３５号决议的某些条款行事，特别是没有把其军队撤回基地，这是目前实施纳米比亚独立计划的主要障碍。
    沙穆亚里拉说，南非部队杀害了许多西南非洲人民组织的战士。如果南非部队继续呆在纳米比亚，难民就无法回归。他们担心被南非部队杀害。
    会议对中东局势进行了广泛的讨论。与会外长们认为，巴勒斯坦问题现在必须提交安理会审议，以便制订出一个明确的方案。
    在讨论到阿富汗局势问题时，外长们指出，苏联军队于今年２月１５日撤走以后，阿富汗国内战斗还不时发生。他们对此感到失望。他们呼吁冲突各方寻求政治解决办法，而不能采用军事解决的手段，军事手段是不可取的。它会造成严重经济损失，摧残人民生命财产，并使国家遭受破坏。
    大会还就世界经济形势、建立国际经济新秩序的谈判问题、国际发展战略、外债和发展等重大国际经济问题进行了广泛的讨论。
    参加会议的不结盟运动成员国和组织共８５个。委内瑞拉、巴西、墨西哥、蒙古、菲律宾等国作为观察员出席了会议。
