A New Cultural Landscape with Multiple Levels: Jingmen City Focuses on Multi-Faceted Cultural Development

    Jingmen City, located on the northern edge of the ancient state of Chu in Hubei Province, has actively promoted cultural development since its establishment in 1983. The city's mass cultural activities have flourished. In the context of reform and opening up, Jingmen City's economy has continued to develop, and its mass cultural work has also seen rapid progress, leading to a new landscape where cultural activities are organized by the state, collectives, and individuals.

    The city has focused on various levels of cultural activities, actively developing multi-faceted cultural construction. Multi-faceted cultural construction is currently the focus of cultural work in rural and urban areas. Based on this, Jingmen City's mass cultural activities primarily revolve around township culture, enterprise culture, and campus culture.

    Jingmen City's rural areas are vast, with 90% of the population living there, making township culture the key to the city's overall cultural work. The main focus of township cultural work is on infrastructure construction. The city allocates funds to gradually build a theater in each township. Additionally, based on the public's interests and hobbies, numerous cultural townships have been formed.

    Enterprise culture is a strength of Jingmen City. The recreational facilities, garden centers, and sports fields built by the Jingmen Refining Plant serve as entertainment venues for employees and also provide convenience for social activities. The provincial employee art and calligraphy exhibition and the city-level sports meet were both held at the refinery.

    Focusing on campus culture, starting with students and children, is a strategic principle of Jingmen City's cultural work. The city's cultural bureau places emphasis on campus cultural work by improving institutions (such as establishing tutoring classes and art kindergartens) to cultivate the next generation of artistic talents.

    In addition, Jingmen City's state-run cultural activities have also developed. In recent years, works created by the city's cultural bureau have included novels that won national excellence awards and flower drum operas that won first-place performances in provincial-level cities. The Jingmen Flower Drum Opera Troupe has performed in rural areas for 13 months over the past two years. In the first half of this year, the troupe's performances attracted over 100,000 audience members.

　　多层次的文化新格局
    荆门市注重多重文化建设
    本报讯  记者毕胜报道：地处古楚国北缘的湖北荆门市，自１９８３年建市以来，积极抓文化建设，群众文化活动蓬勃兴旺。在改革开放的形势下，荆门市经济不断发展的同时，群众文化工作也得到迅速发展，出现了国家、集体、个人办文化的新格局。
    这个市重点抓了不同层次的文化活动，积极发展多重文化建设。多重文化建设是现时农村城镇的文化工作重点。在此基础上，荆门市的群众文化活动以乡镇文化、企业文化和校园文化为主。
    荆门市农村地域广阔，人口占９０％，乡镇文化是整个文化工作的重点。乡镇文化工作主要抓基础设施建设。市里拨经费逐步为每个乡镇修建影剧院，还根据群众的爱好和兴趣，形成了众多的文化乡。
    企业文化是荆门市文化的优势。荆门炼油厂兴建的俱乐部、园林中心、体育场，是企业职工娱乐场所，又为社会提供活动方便。全省职工美术书法获奖作品展和市级运动会都先后在炼油厂举行。
    重视校园文化，从学生抓起，从少儿抓起是荆门市文化工作的战略方针。市文化局将校园文化工作重点放在完善机构（比如办辅导班、艺术幼儿园）上，培养文艺活动的后备军。
    此外，荆门市的国家办文化也得到发展。近年来，市文化局创作人员的作品中有小说获全国优秀奖、花鼓戏获省辖市表演一等奖。荆门市花鼓剧团两年来曾下乡演出１３个月。今年上半年的演出中观众达１０多万人次。
