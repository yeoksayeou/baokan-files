In the impoverished mountains of Xiangxi, a high-tech enterprise has emerged: the Jiannan Machinery Factory in Huaihua City. This factory is the largest base in China for the production of computer magnetic recording device accessories, with its products covering over 50% of the domestic market. Recently, the factory, in collaboration with Huazhong University of Science and Technology, successfully developed the "40 Megabyte Magnetic Disk Servo Code Writing Device," breaking the technological blockade imposed by certain advanced countries and monopolizing the international market.

During the investigation and reporting, the reporter discovered that the factory originally had few advantages: it had only one or two graduates from prestigious universities, limited funding, and relatively outdated equipment. So, how did they manage to succeed through high-tech?

**Daring to Compete**

"Jiannan" was originally an electronics equipment "third-line enterprise" established in 1971 and shut down in 1974. Announcing the shutdown was easy, but what about the 200-plus employees? Thus, they turned to agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishing, struggling to make ends meet through "agriculture supporting industry." In 1975, during the enterprise rectification, a turning point appeared. People who had endured hard times, once they tasted sweetness, often became particularly united and hardworking. In 1976, when the state decided to produce magnetic tape machines, the factory, though ranked sixth among the six participating factories, was determined to succeed. The entire factory worked day and night, and their machine was the first to operate. At that time, the funding method was "watering the seedlings," and the Ministry of Electronics allocated 200,000 yuan to the factory, which produced a sample machine by early 1977. One step ahead, and they took the initiative. Since then, the factory's magnetic tape machines have been used in China's launches of rockets, satellites, and missiles.

**Aiming at the Market**

Some say that in recent years, China's electronics industry has hit a low. Once hailed as the "Electronics City," the Beijing area around Jiuxianqiao, with over 10 research institutes and specialized factories, has seen many technical personnel "reading novels at work." What about Jiannan? To complete large domestic and international orders, they often have to work overtime!

When asked why, factory director Yin Xueren replied, "Products must aim at the domestic and international markets." In fact, Jiannan Factory saw the trend of the rapid development of computers domestically and internationally, aiming at computer peripheral devices, and developing high-tech projects to match them. This is a project that many domestic enterprises dare not venture into, yet the domestic and international markets have a large demand for it.

Now, Jiannan Factory has become one of the world's renowned magnetic head production factories, with its products entering the American, Western European, and Southeast Asian markets in batches. In addition to establishing seven "window enterprises" in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and other places, the factory has also set up sales companies in the United States and Japan.

**Valuing Talent**

The party secretary of Jiannan Factory, Zhou Zhiyin, said, "The main reason our factory can continuously achieve results in the high-tech field is that we have a group of diligent, innovative scientific and technological personnel." We visited many households and found that the living conditions of technical personnel here are generally better than those of other personnel, including the party secretary. It is understood that the bonus amounts are also the same.

Now, the deputy director in charge of production, Wang Dingcai, is an expert invited by Zhou Zhiyin from the 10th Design Institute of the Ministry of Electronics in Beijing in 1977. To persuade Wang Dingcai, Zhou Zhiyin talked with him from afternoon to midnight. Since there were no buses, Zhou Zhiyin walked from Wanliu Road back to Chongwenmen Hotel. The person in charge of the magnetic tape machine circuit trial production, Zuo Daoneng, was hospitalized with viral encephalitis. To save this talent, deputy party secretary Zhu Maoyong led five people to Changsha to take care of him with a car full of food and necessities.

The reporter once asked the chief engineer, Li Yuanming, "Why are your technical personnel so dedicated?"

He smiled and said, "The reason is simple—'a scholar dies for his lord.'"

　　山沟里如何飞出高科技   
    ——湘西建南机器厂的调查
    本报记者  王溪元
    在贫困的湘西山区，居然出现了一个高科技企业，这就是地处怀化市的建南机器厂。这里是我国最大的计算机磁记录设备配套基地，它的产品覆盖国内市场面积达５０％多。最近，该厂与华中理工大学联合研制成功“４０兆磁盘伺服码刻写装置”，打破了个别技术先进国家封锁有关技术、垄断国际市场的局面。
    记者在调查采访中发现，这个厂本来并没有多少优势：名牌大学的毕业生只有一两名，资金并不充足，原有设备也较简陋。那么，他们怎样靠高科技起家的呢？
    　　　　敢于竞争
    “建南”原是搞电子设备的“三线企业”，１９７１年创建，１９７４年下马。宣布下马容易，可是全厂２００多人怎样安置？于是搞起了农、林、牧、副、渔，在“以农养工”中苦度日月，１９７５年在企业整顿中出现转机。经受过苦日子的人们一旦苦尽甜来，往往显得特别团结、肯干。１９７６年国家要搞磁带机，该厂虽然在参战的６个厂中被排在第６位，但是他们憋足了劲头，全厂上下日夜奋战，结果是他们厂的机器最先转动起来。当时的拨款办法是“见苗浇水”，电子工业部将２０万元资金交给了这个厂，他们在１９７７年初就拿出了样机。一步抢先，步步主动。此后我国发射火箭、卫星、导弹时，都使用了该厂的磁带机。
    　　　　瞄准市场
    有人说，这几年我国电子工业走入低谷。曾被誉为“电子城”的北京酒仙桥一带的１０多个研究所和专业厂，其中就有不少技术人员“上班无事看小说”。建南呢？为了完成大批的国内外订货任务，经常要加班加点地干！
    向建南人问原因，厂长尹学仁回答说：“产品要瞄准国内外市场。”事实上，建南厂是看到了国内外计算机大发展的趋势，瞄准计算机外部设备，开发与其配套的高科技项目，这是近期国内许多企业不敢涉足而国内外市场又大量要货的项目。
    现在建南厂已成为世界著名的磁头生产厂家之一，它的产品已成批量地进入美国、西欧、东南亚市场。该厂除在香港、深圳等地办起了７个“窗口企业”之外，还在美国、日本办起了销售公司。
    　　　　重视人才
    建南厂的党委书记邹志钰说：“我们厂之所以能够在高科技领域中不断取得成果，其中一个主要因素就是有一批勤勤恳恳、勇于开拓创新的科技人员。”我们到许多住户走了一下，发现这里的技术人员的居住条件普遍高于包括党委书记在内的其他人员。据了解，奖金数额也是如此。
    现在管生产的副厂长王定才，是邹书记在１９７７年从北京电子工业部第十设计院请来的专家。为了说服王定才，邹书记同他从下午谈到午夜１２点，因为没有公共汽车了，邹书记步行从万寿路回到崇文门旅馆。负责磁带机线路试制的左道能患病毒性脑炎住院，为了抢救这个人才，党委副书记朱茂雍带着５个人用汽车拉着吃的、用的到长沙去护理。
    记者曾问总工程师李元明：“你们厂的技术人员为什么肯拚命？”
    他笑着说：“道理很简单——士为知己者死。”
