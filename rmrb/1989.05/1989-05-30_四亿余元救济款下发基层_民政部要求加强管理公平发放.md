Over 400 million yuan in relief funds for major natural disasters have been allocated to various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions that have suffered severe disasters in the first five months of this year. These funds are used to help disaster victims with medical treatment, food, clothing, and housing. The person in charge of disaster relief at the Ministry of Civil Affairs has called on local governments to work with disaster relief departments to handle the application, use, and management of disaster relief funds, ensuring that the funds reach the truly needy households.

Last year, China experienced a moderately severe disaster year, with approximately one-third of the national population affected by disasters, totaling 230 million people. The affected area of crops was 760 million mu, with 350 million mu of crops destroyed and 73 million mu of farmland with no harvest. Due to the disaster, 100 billion kilograms of grain were lost, 2.58 million houses collapsed, and 8 million houses were damaged. Many regions and populations suffered from a lack of grain. In the first five months of this year, some parts of China have experienced multiple significant disasters, including heavy snow, hail, drought, pestilence, landslides, and earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher.

The distribution of relief funds to many provinces and autonomous regions has brought the care of the Party and the government to the majority of disaster victims. However, some villagers have felt that the distribution was unfair. The Ministry of Civil Affairs has received multiple letters from the grassroots level reporting exaggerated disaster situations, embezzlement of relief funds, or the misappropriation of relief funds for other purposes, which are not in accordance with policy regulations. Statistics show that nearly 5% of the relief funds were misused from 1987 to early 1988. To strengthen the application and management of relief funds allocated to various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the Ministry of Civil Affairs requires local governments to curb the trend of "randomly applying for and spending funds"; disaster relief workers must clarify their responsibilities, act with integrity, and work diligently in disaster-stricken areas to ensure that relief funds are used in severely affected areas and for disaster victims who are truly in need.

It is understood that the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council is drafting the "Provisional Regulations on Disaster Relief Work" in conjunction with the civil affairs department. The management and distribution of disaster relief funds will be included in the regulations.

    四亿余元救济款下发基层
    民政部要求加强管理公平发放
    本报北京5月30日讯  4.5亿元特大自然灾害救济款，今年头5个月已陆续拨往各遭受重灾的省、市、区，用于灾民治病养伤、解决衣食和住房等困难。民政部主管救灾的部门负责人要求各地政府协同救灾部门做好救灾款申报、使用、管理工作，把救灾款用到真正的困难户身上。
    去年，我国为中等偏重灾年，受灾人口约占全国人口的1／3，成灾人口2.3亿多；农作物受灾面积7.6亿亩，成灾面积3.5亿多亩，无收成农田7300 多万亩，因灾减粮100多亿公斤、倒房258万间、损房800多万间，相当部分地区和人口缺粮。今年头5个月，我国局部地区又多次发生较明显的大暴雪、冰雹、旱灾、病虫灾、山体滑坡和6级以上地震。
    救灾款发放给许多省区的大多数灾民，带去了党和政府的关怀，但也有一些乡村农民感到发放不公。民政部多次收到基层来信，反映夸大灾情、冒领救济款或将救济款平摊、挪作它用等不合政策规定的情况。据统计，1987至1988年初，将近5％的救济款被违纪使用。为了加强下拨救济款申报和各省市、区手头现有救济款管理使用工作，民政部要求各地刹住“乱要款乱花款”歪风；救灾工作人员要明确自身职责、廉洁奉公、深入灾区扎实工作，使救灾款切实用在重灾区和确有困难的灾民身上。
    据悉，国务院法制局正会同民政部门起草“救灾工作暂行规定”，救灾基金管理和发放使用将列入规定。（席爱鸣）
