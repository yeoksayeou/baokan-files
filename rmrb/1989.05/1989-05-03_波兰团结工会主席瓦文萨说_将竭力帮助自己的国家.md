　　波兰团结工会主席瓦文萨说    
    将竭力帮助自己的国家
    新华社华沙５月２日电  波兰团结工会主席瓦文萨今天宣布，他将“竭尽全力帮助自己的国家——波兰”，而不是帮助任何团体，其中包括他自己所在的团体。
    他是在同波兰部长会议成员、工会事务部长奥莱克塞在格但斯克举行会见后说这番话的。
    这是团结工会合法化后，政府工会事务部长同团结工会主席举行的首次工作性会晤。
    双方在会见时讨论了国家行政机构同工会的合作问题，也讨论了团结工会同波兰工会全国协议会的合作问题，以及当前波兰劳动者所面临的其他问题。双方表示，今后在解决有关劳动者的问题时，政府将同工会采取伙伴式的联合行动。
    双方对这次会见所取得的成果表示满意。
