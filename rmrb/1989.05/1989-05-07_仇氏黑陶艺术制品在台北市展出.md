	Commemorative Black Pottery Artworks by the Qiu Family on Display in Taipei

	Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: According to relevant departments in Taiwan, the black pottery art exhibition by mainland sculptors Qiu Zhihai and Qiu Shisen opened on May 4 in Taipei. Residents from various sectors in Taipei have been flocking to see the "Black Angels" from the mainland.

	The black pottery artworks, known for being "black as lacquer, shiny as a mirror, thin as paper, and hard as porcelain," were first unearthed in 1928 in Longshan Town, Jinan, Shandong. They are a precursor to Chinese Xia-Shang culture and were gradually replaced by bronze artifacts during the Han Dynasty. Qiu Zhihai, a sculptor from the Jinan Military Region, and his son Qiu Shisen, spent three years excavating and researching, successfully creating and firing 147 varieties of black pottery artifacts. These include replicas of ancient artifacts, imitations of ancient shapes, and newly created modern-themed works. Since mid-April, many Taiwanese newspapers and magazines have published articles introducing Qiu's black pottery art, describing it as embodying the "roots of the nation" and noting that it reflects the shared cultural heritage of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait over thousands of years.

　　仇氏黑陶艺术制品在台北市展出
    新华社济南电  （记者蒋永武）据台湾有关部门电：大陆雕塑家仇志海、仇世森黑陶艺术展览５月４日在台北市开幕。台北市各界群众争相观看来自大陆的“黑色天使”。
    “黑如漆、亮如镜、薄如纸、硬如瓷”的黑陶艺术制品，于１９２８年首次在山东济南龙山镇出土，是我国夏商文化的先导，传至汉代逐渐被青铜器取代。济南军区雕塑创作员仇志海和他的儿子仇世森，经过３年发掘与研究，成功地创作、烧制黑陶工艺品１４７个品种，既有复制的远古时代器具，又有仿制的古代造型，还有新创作的现代题材作品。自４月中旬以来，台湾许多报刊载文介绍仇氏黑陶艺术，称它们体现了“民族之根”，“从中看到了海峡两岸数千年文化同根相连”。
