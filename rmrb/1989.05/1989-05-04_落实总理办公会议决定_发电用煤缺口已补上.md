	Implementation of the Premier's Office Meeting Decision:
	Coal Shortage for Power Generation Has Been Addressed

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on May 2 (reporter Zhao Mingliang), the reporter learned from the Ministry of Energy that to ensure the need for power generation, the State Council's Premier's Office Meeting decided in early March to increase the supply of 1,000 million tons of coal for power generation. Subsequently, relevant departments have done a lot of work, and the supply of this batch of coal has now been basically secured.

	According to the national plan for power generation this year, the coal supply gap for the four major power grids in North China, East China, Northeast China, and Central China is nearly 1,000 million tons. To solve this problem, Premier Li Peng presided over a meeting of the Premier's Office on March 3 and made a decision: from the overproduced coal in various coal mines, 1,000 million tons of coal plan indicators will be added for power generation.

	It is understood that the task of producing an additional 1,000 million tons of coal for power generation is undertaken by the China National Coal Industry Corporation, the Northeast Inner Mongolia Coal Industry Corporation, and the China Local Coal Industry Corporation. According to the reported production increases from various coal mines, the amount has exceeded 1,000 million tons.

　　落实总理办公会议决定    
    发电用煤缺口已补上
    据新华社北京５月２日电（记者赵明亮）记者从能源部获悉，为确保发电的需要，３月上旬国务院总理办公会议决定增供１０００万吨发电用煤。事后有关部门做了大量工作，目前这批货源已基本得到了落实。
    按照国家下达的今年发电量计划的要求，华北、华东、东北、华中四大电网的煤炭供应缺口近１０００万吨。为解决这一个问题，李鹏总理３月３日主持召开总理办公会议作出决定：从各地煤矿的超产煤中，给发电用煤增加１０００万吨计划指标。
    据了解，增产１０００万吨发电用煤的任务由中国统配煤矿总公司、东北内蒙古煤炭工业联合公司和中国地方煤炭工业总公司承担，据各地煤炭上报的增产数量已超过１０００万吨。
