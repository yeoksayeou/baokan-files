In the plant world, there exists a little-known biological oil resource. Plants, through photosynthesis, can also synthesize substances similar to oil. Some, after simple processing, can be refined into gasoline, diesel, and other fuels. Thus, it can be said that oil can also be "planted."

Brazil has a type of rubber tree that can exude 20 to 30 kilograms of latex in half a year. Its chemical composition is similar to oil, and it can be used as diesel without any refining.

In the farms of California, USA, there is a widely distributed weed with tall stems and pointed leaves. It is said that its scent can repel rodents like yellow rats that harm crops, commonly known as "yellow rat grass." This plant can be refined into genuine oil. Each hectare of wild yellow rat grass can produce 1,000 kilograms of oil, while cultivated hybrid yellow rat grass can yield 6,000 kilograms per hectare. According to this ratio, if yellow rat grass is planted on a circular plot of land with a diameter of 19.3 miles, it can produce an average of 500 kilograms of oil per day and night.

Experts from the General Electric Company of the United States and scientists from the California Institute of Technology have cultivated a giant seaweed in the waters near the west coast of the United States. It roots in the seabed rocks and can grow 60 centimeters in one day and night. This seaweed, after processing, can yield a combustible substance similar to diesel. Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Solar Energy Research Institute are expanding the experiment, cultivating this single-celled seaweed in seawater-filled pools to directly refine gasoline and diesel for automobiles. Once this experiment succeeds, it will not only significantly reduce the cost of gasoline but also meet 8% of the entire U.S. fuel demand.

### 石油也可以“种植”

　　石油也可以“种植”
    在植物世界里，存在一个鲜为人知的生物石油资源。植物经光合作用，也可合成类似石油的物质，有的经过简易加工，便可炼制汽油、柴油等。由此可以说，石油也可以“种植”。
    巴西有一种香胶树，半年之内每一棵香胶树可分泌出２０至３０公斤的胶汁，它的化学成分同石油相似，不必经过任何提炼，即可当作柴油使用。
    美国加州农场中有一种分布极广的杂草，其杆高叶尖，据说它的气味可以驱除黄鼠等啮齿类危害农作物的动物，俗称“黄鼠草”，用这种植物可以提炼出正宗石油。每公顷的野生黄鼠草可提炼出１０００公斤的石油，人工培植的杂交黄鼠草，每公顷则可出油６０００公斤。按这种比例推算，直径为１９．３英里的圆形土地上种植黄鼠草，平均每昼夜可产油５００公斤。
    美国通用电气公司的专家与加州工学院的科学家们，在美国西海岸附近的海域中培育一种巨型海藻，它植根于海底岩石，一昼夜可长６０厘米，用这种海藻加工即可收获类似柴油的可燃体。现在，美国能源部与太阳能研究所正在扩大实验，在水池中灌注海水培育这种单细胞的海藻，来直接炼制汽车燃料的汽油与柴油。一旦这项实验获得成功，不但大大降低汽油的成本，而且可以满足整个美国燃料需求量的８％。
