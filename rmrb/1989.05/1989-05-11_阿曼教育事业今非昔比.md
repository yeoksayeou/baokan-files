Oman's education sector has made great strides since Qaboos bin Said took power in 1970. The country has made remarkable progress in various fields, with its education sector particularly noteworthy. UNESCO has praised Oman as a "model for developing countries."

Before Qaboos took power, Oman had only three primary schools for boys nationwide, with a total of 909 students. There were only 30 teachers, all of whom were foreigners. Students studied in makeshift classrooms, tents, or under trees. All textbooks were written by foreigners.

Currently, according to Oman's government plan, the education sector has entered a "revitalization period." King Qaboos has stated, "Education is a right for everyone, young and old, male and female." Over the past 18 years, the government has vigorously promoted primary and secondary education, allocating substantial funds annually for education. Schools do not charge tuition fees, and students receive various allowances and subsidies. Transportation is also provided for students who live far from school, significantly increasing the enrollment rate. In the 1988-1989 academic year, the country had 368 primary schools, 267 middle schools, 66 general high schools, 7 Islamic middle schools attached to mosques, 1 Islamic high school, 3 technical secondary schools, 1 school for the deaf, 1 school for the disabled, and 5 secondary teacher training schools, totaling 719 schools. There were over 300,000 students and more than 10,000 teachers, which is quite impressive compared to the national population of less than 2 million.

While vigorously promoting regular schools, the Omani government also pays attention to literacy work. Literacy centers and adult education centers are scattered throughout the country. In the 1987-1988 academic year, there were 440 literacy classes with over 10,000 participants. In addition to teaching Arabic, some professional and technical training is also provided. Courses for housewives are also offered. The Omani government aims to eradicate illiteracy by the end of the century.

The Omani government places great importance on vocational and technical education, establishing secondary agricultural, commercial, and industrial schools to provide talent for various industrial, agricultural, and commercial sectors. During the third five-year plan (1986-1990), the state will improve the level of various secondary vocational and technical schools. The education publishing department has recently compiled textbooks on agricultural and fisheries knowledge, which some primary and secondary schools have made compulsory. Currently, 80% of the teachers in the Omani education system are foreigners, so the state highly values teacher training. From 1986 to the present, teacher training schools have trained 1,031 people, primarily to meet the needs of middle and primary schools. The state plans to achieve full "Omanization" of primary school teachers within the next 10 years.

In recent years, Oman has sent over 3,000 students abroad. So far, nearly 2,000 have returned after completing their studies.

The Qaboos University, completed in 1986, is Oman's first national university, marking a new era in Oman's education sector. The entire university cost over $300 million, with 1,828 students currently enrolled. The college has all kinds of facilities, and the teaching and research equipment is advanced. The curriculum stipulates that teaching and research must be adapted to Oman's national conditions.

A university official said, "Next year, the first batch of graduates from Qaboos University will go to work in various important positions in the country, contributing to economic development."

　　阿曼教育事业今非昔比
    刘元培
    自卡布斯·本·赛义德１９７０年执政以来，阿曼在各个方面突飞猛进，教育事业尤其引人瞩目，联合国教科文组织称誉阿曼为“发展中国家的典范”。
    卡布斯执政前，阿曼全国只有３所男生小学，在校学生总共９０９人。教师全部也不过３０人，而且都是外国人。学生们在草棚、帐篷或树荫下学习。课本全部由外国人编写。
    目前，按照阿曼政府的计划，教育事业进入“复兴时期”。卡布斯国王说：“受教育是男女老幼所有人的权利。”１８年来，政府大力普及中小学教育，每年拨出大量经费办教育。学校免收学费，发给学生各种津贴、补助，还为离校较远的学生提供交通工具，从而大大提高学生入学率。１９８８—１９８９学年，全国已有小学３６８所，初中２６７所，普通高中６６所，７所附属清真寺的伊斯兰初级中学，１所伊斯兰高级中学，３所中等技术学校，１所聋哑学校，１所残疾人学校，５所中等师范学校，各类学校总共７１９所。在校学生３０多万人，教师１万多人，这些数字与不到２００万的全国人口相比，确实十分可观。
    在大力兴办正规学校的同时，阿曼政府注意扫盲工作。扫盲中心、成人教育中心遍及全国各地。１９８７—１９８８学年，扫盲学习班达４４０个，参加人数１万多。除了教阿拉伯语外，也进行一些专业技术的训练，还为家庭妇女开设了课程。阿曼政府力争到本世纪末全部消灭文盲。
    阿曼政府非常重视专业技术教育，开办了中等农业、商业和工业学校，为各工、农、商部门输送人才。第三个五年计划期间（１９８６—１９９０年），国家将提高各中等专业技术学校的水平。教育出版部门最近还编印了农业和渔业知识的课本，部分中小学已将此列为必修课。目前，阿曼教育部门中，外籍教员占８０％，所以国家高度重视师范教育，从１９８６年到现在的３年中，师范学校共培养了１０３１人，首先满足初中和小学的需要。国家计划在今后１０年内，实现小学教师全部“阿曼化”。
    近几年来，阿曼派出留学生３０００多名。到目前为止，已有近２０００人学成回国。
    １９８６年落成的卡布斯大学，是阿曼第一所国立大学，它标志着阿曼教育事业进入了一个新时期。整个大学投资３亿多美元，在校学生１８２８人。学院各种设施齐全，教学、科研设备先进。教学大纲规定：教学和科研必须与阿曼的国情相适应。
    大学的一位负责人说：“明年，卡布斯大学第一批毕业生将到国家各个重要岗位去工作，为发展经济作出贡献。”
