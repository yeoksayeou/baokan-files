According to a recent survey by relevant national departments on the planting arrangements of 77,000 farming households in 21 provinces producing flue-cured tobacco, this year, China's flue-cured tobacco planting area, which increased by 40% last year, has expanded by another 19.2%. Based on this, it is estimated that the national flue-cured tobacco planting area this year will reach over 23 million mu. Since the 1950s, China's population has increased by approximately onefold, while the sales volume of cigarettes has surged by tenfold. Additionally, a significant portion of farmers do not smoke cigarettes but prefer to smoke tobacco leaves. Over the past 20 years, China's tobacco industry has developed rapidly at an average annual growth rate of 10%, making China the world leader in both tobacco production and consumption. China's vigorous production and consumption of tobacco stand in stark contrast to the global trend of gradually restricting tobacco production and consumption. In pursuit of immediate high profits, China's aggressive development of tobacco production is detrimental to the long-term development of the country and the nation.

Tobacco harms human health and also poses serious threats to agricultural production. This year, at least 11.5 million tons of grain planting area will be displaced.

The author believes that the fundamental reason for the severe overproduction of tobacco is the fiscal responsibility system implemented by the state. The current local fiscal responsibility system and cadre evaluation system have strengthened the utilitarian mindset of local governments. Tobacco is a high-tax, high-profit commodity, and promoting the production of flue-cured tobacco can open up tax sources for local governments and increase local fiscal revenue. Local government leaders, driven by local interests, vigorously encourage or even force farmers to develop flue-cured tobacco production. Some provinces, in order to collect a 38% tobacco leaf tax, disregard natural and economic conditions, use administrative measures to forcibly plant tobacco, and impose additional quotas. Some provinces' flue-cured tobacco planting area this year will increase by more than 30% compared to last year. Some places even adopt harsh measures such as fining 100 yuan for every mu of tobacco not planted, implementing these measures village by village and household by household. Consequently, this year's flue-cured tobacco planting area has increased significantly on top of last year's substantial increase.

The severe overproduction of tobacco has disrupted the rational planting structure and industrial structure, making it extremely inconsistent with the overall development of the national economy.

### 烟草生产过剩之弊

　　烟草生产过剩之弊
    据国家有关部门最近对２１个烤烟生产省的７７０００农户种植安排情况的调查，今年我国烤烟种植面积在去年增长４０％的基础上，又扩种１９．２％。据此推算，今年全国烤烟种植面积将达２３００多万亩。自５０年代至今，我国人口增加约１倍，而卷烟销量猛增１０倍，还有相当一部分农民不抽卷烟，而抽烟叶。近２０年来，我国烟草工业以年均递增１０％的速度迅猛发展，我国已成为烟草生产和消费的双料世界冠军。我国大力生产和消费烟草的状况，与当前世界各国都在逐步限制烟草生产和消费形成了鲜明的对照。我国为了获取眼前的高额利润，大力发展烟草生产，对国家和民族的长远发展有害无益。
    烟草损害人类健康，也给农业生产带来严重危害。今年，至少挤掉１１５０万吨粮食的种植面积。
    笔者认为，烟草生产严重过剩的根本原因是国家实行财政包干造成的。现时的地方财政包干体制和干部考核制度，强化了地方政府的功利主义意识。烟草是高税高利商品，大力生产烤烟能为地方开辟税源，增加地方财政收入。各地政府领导干部从地方利益出发，大力鼓励或强制农民发展烤烟生产。有的省为了征收３８％的烟叶税，不顾自然条件、经济条件的限制，采取行政手段，强行种植，层层加码，有的省今年烤烟种植面积将比去年增长３０％以上。一些地方甚至采取少种一亩烟，罚交税金１００元等强硬措施，逐村逐户落实，因而今年烤烟种植面积在去年大幅度增长的基础上，更大幅度地增长。
    烟草生产严重过剩的状况已经打乱了合理的种植结构和产业结构，与整个国民经济发展极不协调。
