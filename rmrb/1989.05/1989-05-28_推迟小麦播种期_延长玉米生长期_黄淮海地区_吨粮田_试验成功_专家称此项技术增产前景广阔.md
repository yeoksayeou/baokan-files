In the arid, saline, sandy, and thin soil regions of the Yellow-Huai-Hai low-yield areas, how can grain yield be increased? Professor Wang Shu'an of Beijing Agricultural University has unique ideas and uses unconventional methods. He delays the wheat sowing period by 10-15 days, allowing this time to be used by corn to realize its yield potential. As a result, his experimental fields produce 1,000 kilograms of corn and wheat per mu, which some people call the "tonnage field."

Today, more than 20 experts and professors from the Ministry of Agriculture, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, and Hebei Province braved the scorching sun to inspect and accept a number of wheat experimental fields in Wuxian County, Hebei Province. They gave high praise to the "tonnage field," believing that this will open up a new path for high-yield grain production in northern China.

Since 1983, Beijing Agricultural University, the Wuxian County Science and Technology Commission, and the Agricultural Bureau have jointly undertaken the national key scientific research project "High-Yield System Research for Summer and Autumn Grain Double Cropping." They used systems engineering, operations research, and optimization methods to analyze the entire year's climate conditions, production resources, and the upper and lower two crops (wheat and corn) as an integrated production system. They boldly proposed the method of delaying the wheat sowing period and took various measures to solve the series of problems caused by late-sown wheat, ensuring that the wheat yield the following year would not decrease. In 1988, on 140 mu of demonstration fields in Fanchun Township, Wuxian County, they achieved a yield of 400 kilograms per mu for late-sown wheat and 550-600 kilograms per mu for medium-late maturing corn. Experts believe that this technology is not complicated and can be implemented by farmers, with the characteristics of high input, high output, and high efficiency.

Economic calculations show that the "tonnage field" increases net income by 300-350 yuan per mu. According to estimates by agricultural technicians in the Cangzhou region, out of the 3.7 million mu of wheat in Cangzhou, 700,000 mu can be used for "tonnage fields." This year, under the organization of the regional government, 20,000 mu of demonstration fields were planted. In the Yellow-Huai-Hai Plain's 170 million mu of wheat, approximately 60 million mu are suitable for "tonnage field" technology. Currently, the annual grain yield is around 500 kilograms per mu. If the yield per mu is increased to 800 kilograms, 16.5 billion kilograms of grain can be added annually.

　　推迟小麦播种期　延长玉米生长期
    黄淮海地区“吨粮田”试验成功
    专家称此项技术增产前景广阔
    本报沧州５月２８日电  记者蒋建科报道：在旱、碱、沙、薄的黄淮海中低产地区，如何提高粮食产量？北京农业大学教授王树安思维独特，出奇制胜，他推迟小麦播种期１０—１５天，把这些时间让给玉米发挥增产潜力，结果，他的试验田里的玉米、小麦加起来亩产达到１０００公斤，有人称它为“吨粮田”。
    今天中午，来自农业部、中国农科院、北京农大及河北省的２０多位专家、教授头顶烈日，在河北省吴桥县兴致勃勃地查看、验收完一块块小麦试验田后，对“吨粮田”给予较高评价，认为这将为我国北方粮食高产提出一条新的途径。
    从１９８３年开始，北京农大、吴桥县科委、农业局共同承担了“夏秋粮两茬作物高产系统研究”这个国家级科技攻关课题，他们运用系统工程学、运筹学和优选法等理论，把全年的气候条件、生产资源及上、下两茬作物（小麦、玉米）作为整体生产系统进行分析，大胆提出推迟小麦播种期的做法，再采取各种措施，解决晚播麦带来的一系列问题，保证来年小麦产量不降低。１９８８年，在吴桥县范屯乡１４０亩示范田上，获得了晚播麦亩产４００公斤、中晚熟玉米亩产５５０—６００公斤的产量。专家们认为，这项技术并不复杂，农民可以做得到，具有高投入、高产出、高效益的特点。
    经济核算表明，“吨粮田”每亩净增收入３００—３５０元。据沧州地区农技人员估计，沧州３７０万亩小麦中，有７０万亩可以搞“吨粮田”，今年，在行署组织下，共种植２万亩示范田。而在黄淮海平原的１．７亿亩小麦中，有约６０００万亩适合“吨粮田”技术，目前全年粮食产量多停留在每亩５００公斤上下，若按每亩产量增加到８００公斤计，每年就可增加粮食１６５亿公斤。
