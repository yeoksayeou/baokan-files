West German renowned gastroenterologist and director of the Erlangen University Psychiatric Hospital, Professor Demling, believes that the path to health lies in paying attention to diet, exercising appropriately, getting enough sleep, not smoking, and drinking less alcohol.

The 68-year-old Professor Demling is a world-renowned gastroenterologist. He is currently the chairman of the West German Internal Medicine Association and the honorary chairman of the World Gastroenterology Organization. In an interview with the *Sunday Bild* reporter, he shared many insightful views on the path to health. He said that to achieve good health, one must pay attention to the following five aspects.

First, diet. The most important thing is to eat plenty of fresh fruits and fibrous vegetables such as apples, oranges, lettuce, carrots, and sauerkraut. Additionally, one should eat protein-rich foods such as fish, milk, skim milk, and meat. One should consume more plant-based fats, including olive oil. However, lard is not as harmful as commonly believed. One should eat less sweets. Drinking a beverage containing vitamin C, such as orange juice, after meals can have a preventive effect against cancer. Drinking a small amount of alcoholic beverages such as wine, beer, or even a bit of hard liquor can be beneficial for health. Because a small amount of alcohol can strengthen the gastric mucosa, which may help prevent gastric ulcers. However, alcohol consumption should not be excessive, as it can be harmful to the heart, liver, and nervous system.

Second, exercise. One should engage in 30 to 40 minutes of exercise daily until sweating.

Third, smoking is harmful to health. One can start by switching to a pipe or snuff, gradually quitting smoking altogether.

Fourth, sleep. One should ensure at least 6 to 7 hours of sleep daily. A 30-minute nap in the afternoon and a short walk before bedtime can help. Those who have trouble sleeping should avoid tea and coffee after 4 PM, but can drink a small cup of cocoa. Drinking a cup of sweet, warm milk before bed can aid in falling asleep.

Fifth, bowel movements. Ideally, one should have a bowel movement once a day, which is beneficial for maintaining a good mood.

　　注意饮食　适当运动　充分睡眠　无烟少酒
    西德专家谈健康之道
    新华社波恩５月１５日电  西德著名胃肠病专家、埃尔兰根大学精神病医院主任医师德姆林教授认为，健康之道在于注意饮食、适当运动、睡眠充分、不抽烟和少喝酒。
    现年６８岁的德姆林教授是世界知名的胃肠病专家。现任西德内医学协会主席和世界胃肠病组织名誉主席。他在接受《星期日图片报》记者采访时对健康之道表示了许多有见地的看法。他说，要做到身体健康，必须注意好以下５个方面的问题。
    第一、饮食。最重要的要多吃新鲜水果和纤维长的蔬菜如苹果、橙子、生菜、胡萝卜、酸菜。此外，还要多吃蛋白质丰富的食品，如鱼、牛奶、脱脂乳以及肉类。要多吃植物脂肪包括橄榄油。但是吃猪油并不如人们普遍认为的那样有害。要少吃甜食。饭后再喝点含维生素Ｃ的饮料如桔子汁，可起到防癌作用。少量饮用含酒精的饮料如葡萄酒、啤酒甚至有时来点白酒对健康有益。因为少量酒精可以加强胃粘膜，从而可能防止胃溃疡。但饮酒不能过量，否则，有害于心脏、肝脏和神经系统。
    第二、运动。每天进行３０至４０分钟的运动，直至发汗为止。
    第三、抽烟有害于健康，可以从改抽烟斗或吸鼻烟起，慢慢做到完全将烟戒掉。
    第四、睡眠。每天至少要保证６至７小时睡眠。中午小睡３０分钟，晚上临睡前散会儿步，睡眠不好的人，下午４时后不要饮茶和咖啡，但可喝一小杯可可。睡前饮一杯甜甜的热牛奶有利于入眠。
    第五、大便。最好每日一次，这对保持良好情绪很有益。
