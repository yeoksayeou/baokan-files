The People's Daily reports: According to the Los Angeles Times, the U.S. government has decided to scrap the U-2 type high-altitude spy plane, which has been in use for 34 years. The last remaining aircraft of this type will be sent to the Warner-Robins Air Force Base in Georgia for display.

Since 1955, the U-2 spy plane has been frequently used by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency for reconnaissance missions over other countries. In May 1960, the Soviet Union shot down one of these planes for the first time. Subsequently, several more U-2 planes were shot down over China and Cuba.
