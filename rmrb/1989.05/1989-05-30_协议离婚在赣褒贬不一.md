    Recently, in Nanchang City's Lion Tower Restaurant, an unusual banquet was taking place. A couple, having completed their divorce proceedings, gathered here to celebrate their amicable separation.

    People refer to this kind of amicable divorce as "divorce by agreement." It is understood that in two urban districts of Nanchang City, there were 1,145 divorces last year, of which 359 were by agreement, accounting for approximately 31.3% of the total.

    During the process of these agreed divorces, the couples generally showed tolerance and friendliness. Although they all admitted to emotional incompatibility, they rarely used harsh or severe language to criticize each other, and most reflected on their own shortcomings. Many even sincerely wished for their former spouse to find a suitable partner in the future. When dividing property, they generally acted reasonably and there was little quarreling. A young couple, for example, had marital problems due to conflicts with in-laws. The husband, who earned significantly more than the wife, voluntarily offered several thousand yuan in savings to help the wife with her living expenses. He also let her choose the high-end household appliances and furniture, while the wife was also considerate. Both parties expressed that although they would no longer be husband and wife, they could still maintain a friendly relationship.

    The rise of divorce by agreement in Nanchang City has sparked varied opinions from different sectors of society. Some young and middle-aged couples believe that this "amicable separation" method is feasible. Some in the judicial department also pointed out that a friendly divorce by agreement is a step forward compared to a hostile, contentious divorce. However, some in the Women's Federation are concerned that this approach may significantly increase the divorce rate, making their work more challenging. The Civil Affairs Department also believes that divorce is not a lighthearted or joyful matter and will cause psychological trauma to the parties involved and their children.

    协议离婚在赣褒贬不一
    本报讯  前不久，南昌市狮子楼酒家，一次奇特的筵席正在进行。一对离异夫妻在办妥了离婚手续后，来此摆筵庆贺好聚好散。
    人们把这种好聚好散的离婚称为“协议离婚”。据了解，南昌市两个城区去年离婚夫妻有1145对，其中协议离婚359对，约占总数的31.3％。
    这些离异夫妻在协议离婚过程中，大都宽容、友好，尽管都承认感情不合，但一般不以苛刻、严厉的词语指责对方，多从自身方面反思，不少人还由衷地祝愿对方日后找个如意伴侣。在分割财产时，也一般能通情达理，较少争吵不休。一对青年夫妻因翁婿矛盾导致夫妻隔阂加深。男方收入比女方高得多，主动提出将几千元存款给女方安排生活，高档家用电器和家具也任凭女方挑，而女方也能谦让。双方表示，今后虽不是夫妻，但仍可作为朋友来往。
    南昌市协议离婚的兴起，社会各界议论不一。一些中青年夫妇认为这种“好聚好散”的办法是可行的。司法部门一些人也指出，友好的协议离婚较之反目为仇的吵闹离婚，应当说是一个进步。但妇联的同志则担心，这样做离婚率将明显提高，工作难度更大。民政部门也认为，离婚毕竟不是轻松愉快的事，会给当事人及子女带来心灵上的创伤。
