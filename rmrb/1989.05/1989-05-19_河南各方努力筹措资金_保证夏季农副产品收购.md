Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 19th - The reporter learned from the ongoing Henan Provincial Financial Activation Conference that to ensure the summer procurement of grain, oil, and tobacco without issuing IOUs, various departments in Henan, including finance, grain, tobacco, and supply and marketing, are jointly mobilizing resources to secure funds for agricultural product procurement.

Currently, Henan's wheat and rapeseed harvests are expected to be bountiful and will soon be ready for market. According to calculations by the grain and tobacco departments, a total of 2.8 billion yuan will be needed for procurement by the end of July. By tapping into potential resources, speeding up sales, and collecting overdue payments, the grain, tobacco, and supply and marketing departments can raise 2.2 billion yuan for agricultural product procurement. The remaining 600 million yuan will be secured by banks through increasing deposits, recovering loans, and providing temporary loans. The Henan Provincial Government has demanded that all departments complete their fundraising tasks on schedule and must not issue IOUs to farmers again.

    新华社郑州５月１９日电（记者姬世法）记者从正在召开的河南省搞活资金会议上获悉：为保证夏季粮食、油料、烟叶收购不打白条，河南省金融、粮食、烟草、供销各个部门，正共同努力筹措资金，用于农副产品收购。
    目前河南小麦、油菜丰收在望，即将登场。据粮食、烟草部门计算，７月底以前，共需收购资金２８亿元。通过挖掘潜力，加快调销，催收货款等项工作，粮食、烟草、供销部门可以筹措２２亿元资金用于农副产品收购；其余６亿元，由各家银行用增加存款、收回贷款和增加临时贷款解决。河南省人民政府要求，各家筹措资金的任务要如期完成，决不能再给农民打白条了。
