Nicaraguan President Ortega visited West Germany yesterday for a one-day trip, holding talks with West German President Weizsäcker and Chancellor Kohl on issues including the peace process in Central America.

According to reports, during the talks, President Ortega hoped that Western European countries would support the peace process in Central America. Chancellor Kohl stated that the West German government generally supports the deployment of UN observers to monitor the peace process in Central America. If the UN Secretary-General formally proposes this plan, West Germany is prepared to work with countries such as Canada and Spain to play a role.

On the issue of West Germany resuming development aid to Nicaragua, there were differing opinions. The West German government links development aid to Nicaragua's domestic democratization process. Ortega holds a different view on this matter.

　　奥尔特加访问西德
    本报波恩５月１０日电  记者江建国报道：尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加昨天对西德进行了一天访问，先后同西德总统魏茨泽克和总理科尔就中美洲和平等问题进行了会谈。
    据报道，在会谈中，奥尔特加总统希望西欧国家支持中美洲的和平进程。科尔总理说，西德政府原则上赞成由联合国派出观察组对中美洲和平进行监督，如果联合国秘书长正式提出这一计划，西德准备同加拿大、西班牙等国家共同发挥作用。
    在涉及西德重新恢复对尼加拉瓜提供发展援助问题上，双方意见分歧。西德政府把发展援助同尼加拉瓜国内民主化进程相联系。奥尔特加对此持不同看法。
