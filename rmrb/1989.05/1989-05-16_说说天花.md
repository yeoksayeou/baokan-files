Talking About Smallpox

Smallpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the smallpox virus. The source of infection is the patient. Humans have no natural immunity to smallpox. When exposed to a smallpox patient or to items contaminated by the patient's pustules, scabs, or droplets, such as clothing and food, one can become infected. Smallpox has a sudden onset. Within the first 1 to 3 days, symptoms include high fever, body aches, and nausea. Starting from the 4th day, the patient's face, neck, and limbs develop firm skin lesions, which then turn into pustules and form scabs. Approximately 3 weeks later, the scabs fall off, leaving scars on the skin. The mortality rate for severe smallpox is high. After contracting smallpox, individuals develop lifelong immunity, and reinfection is extremely rare.

Smallpox was first recorded in the 5th century AD. By the 16th century, China had widely adopted the variolation method to prevent smallpox, which involved inoculating healthy individuals with the pus from mild smallpox patients to induce immunity. In 1796, British doctor Edward Jenner successfully used cowpox inoculation to prevent smallpox. Cowpox vaccine is made by inoculating healthy calves with cowpox virus and then collecting the pus, which is processed to create the vaccine. Injecting this vaccine into healthy individuals can confer immunity to smallpox. Before liberation, smallpox was widespread across China, posing a significant threat to the health and lives of the people. After the founding of New China, a nationwide vaccination campaign was launched, quickly eradicating smallpox.

In 1977, the last case of smallpox occurred in Africa. In October 1979, the World Health Organization announced the global eradication of smallpox. Currently, only a small amount of smallpox virus is preserved in a few medical research institutions for scientific research. Given this situation, China has removed smallpox vaccination from the routine immunization schedule for children.

Recently, there have been instances in some regions where fake cowpox vaccines made from human skin scabs are being administered to children. This practice is neither scientific nor safe. It is entirely different from China's traditional variolation method. Human skin infections are often caused by bacterial infections, which do not confer immunity to smallpox and have no preventive effect. Fake cowpox vaccines made from infected skin scabs contain a large number of bacteria. After inoculation, children may suffer from bacterial infections, with mild cases resulting in skin infections at the inoculation site, and severe cases leading to sepsis, which can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is hoped that the public will not be deceived by such practices.

　　说说天花
    天花是一种由天花病毒引起的烈性传染病，其传染源是病人。人类对天花没有天然的免疫力，当接触了天花病人，或接触了被病人的疱疹、痂皮、飞沫等污染的衣物、食品后，便可发病。天花起病很急，发病的第１至３天表现为高热、周身疼痛、恶心等；从第４天开始，病人脸面、颈部及四肢出现较为坚实的皮疹，继而化脓、结痂，大约３周左右痂皮脱落，皮肤留下瘢痕。重型天花病死率较高。患天花后可产生终生免疫力，第二次患病者极为罕见。
    天花发现于公元５世纪。我国在１６世纪已广泛采用人痘接种法预防天花，即用轻症天花病人痘浆接种于健康人的鼻孔，使健康人产生免疫力。１７９６年英国医生琴纳（Ｊｅｎｎｅｒ）试用牛痘接种法成功，有效地预防了天花。牛痘是用牛痘苗病毒接种健康牛犊皮肤，然后收集痘液，经过特殊处理后制成。将这种疫苗接种到健康人体上，可以获得对天花的免疫力。解放前，我国各地都有天花流行，对人民的生命健康威胁极大。新中国成立后实行了全民种痘，很快在全国范围内消灭了天花。
    １９７７年，在非洲发生了最后一例天花。１９７９年１０月，世界卫生组织宣布在全球范围内消灭了天花。目前，仅在少数医学科研机构里保留了少量天花病毒供科研用。鉴于这种情况，我国在对儿童的计划免疫中取消了种痘一项。
    现在，少数地区出现用人皮肤脓疮的痂皮制造假牛痘为儿童接种的现象，这既不科学，也极其危险。它与我国传统的人痘接种法截然不同。人皮肤化脓多是细菌感染所致，而细菌感染并不能使人体产生对天花的免疫力，根本没有预防天花的作用。用脓疮痂皮制造的假牛痘中含有大量细菌，接种后可使儿童受到细菌的侵袭，轻者接种处皮肤化脓，重者可发生败血症，危及儿童生命。因此，希望广大群众不要上当受骗。
