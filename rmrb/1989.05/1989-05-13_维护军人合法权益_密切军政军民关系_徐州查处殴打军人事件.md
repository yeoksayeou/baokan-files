The public security authorities of Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, detained two ringleaders, Wang Chaofu and Wang Chaosheng, the Party branch secretary and deputy secretary of Dianzi Village, respectively, on April 7 for disturbing the peace and assaulting soldiers in the camp area.

On the afternoon of March 31, Lieutenant Colonel Li Xuewen and First Lieutenant Li Shaojiang of the Engineering Command Academy were repairing their bicycles at a repair shop outside the camp. Because they stood up for justice, they were beaten and scolded by Wang Chaofu, the Party branch secretary of Dianzi Village in the suburbs of Xuzhou City. Wang Chaofu then called the villagers who were watching to carry Li Xuewen to the village. The deputy secretary of the village Party branch, Wang Chaosheng, punched and kicked Li Xuewen. Subsequently, Wang Chaofu, Wang Chaosheng, and others directed 30 to 40 villagers to climb over the gate and rush into the Engineering Command Academy camp, assaulting officers and soldiers.

The Xuzhou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government promptly handled this incident and required relevant departments to strengthen the education of cadres and the masses on legal and national defense awareness, resolutely safeguarding the legal rights of soldiers.
