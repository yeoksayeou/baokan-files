We visited the Beijing Library. Its collection ranks fifth in the world and first in Asia.

The staff member who received us said: Last year, the library served approximately 1,530,000 readers, more than double the number from 1986 before the new library building was completed. The circulation of documents was 3,370,000 times. The entire library (including branches) has nearly 30 reading rooms; last year, 35,593 people obtained borrowing and reading cards. Due to the large number of readers, some restrictions had to be placed on issuing cards.

From the readers' situation, in recent years, literature and arts were popular, but recently the focus has shifted to public relations, foreign languages, computers, law, psychology, and sports. People's interests are becoming more practical, effective, and tool-oriented.

In the reading rooms, most of the readers are university students and technical personnel, with several hundred people coming each day. Latecomers have to queue up to receive their seat tickets.

We asked a university student who was queuing, "What do you think about the trend of students dropping out of school?" He replied, "It's because of unfair employment practices! In some places, jobs and recruitment do not value knowledge. Even foreign PhDs are unemployed! People thus feel that studying is pointless. However, I think reading is useful. Unfair employment is not the fault of knowledge; you shouldn't punish yourself for society's flaws. Selfishly speaking, not studying is too foolish."

At the book checkout counter, we met a graduate student from Tianjin who had come to look up materials. His surname is Cui, and he is 23 years old, currently pursuing a master's degree in management at Tianjin University. He said, "I have been here for three days, preparing to write a paper on the investment policy of the Three Gorges Project. For those of us studying management, practical experience is especially important. But the school provides few opportunities for students to gain practical experience. Much of the knowledge is outdated, and students have lost interest. After studying for more than a decade, when it comes to applying what we've learned, we still feel like our minds are empty. This problem should be solved by the school, but now we students have to compensate for the deficiencies in education, otherwise, we will just be sacrifices."

A reader named Wan Chunhou had a good chat with us. He graduated from Peking University's Physics Department in 1956, studied in the Soviet Union, and now works at the Energy Research Institute of the State Planning Commission. He said, "Coming to the Beijing Library to read has become a habit for me. Some young people, however, don't think much of it. They ask me, 'How many big books have you published? How many awards have you won? Can you compare with a millionaire?' Their thoughts are understandable. But we, at this age, think, what should we use to measure a nation's attitude towards survival?"

　　北京图书馆见闻
    红彦　刘深　鹿舫
    我们来到北京图书馆。它的藏书量居世界第五，亚洲第一。
    接待我们的同志介绍说：北图去年接待读者约１５３万人次，比１９８６年北图新馆落成前增加１倍多，文献流通量为３３７万册次。全馆（包括分馆）有近３０个阅览室；去年３５５９３人办理了借书证和阅览证。由于读者太多，不得不在办证上作了一些限制。
    从读者情况看，前些年，文学、艺术是热门，最近转到了公共关系、外语、计算机、法律、心理学和体育。人们的兴趣趋于实用、实效和工具性。
    在阅览室看书的，多是大学生和科技人士，每天几百人次。迟到的读者只好排队，等着领取座位牌。
    我们问一个正在排队的大学生：“你对青少年中的厌学、辍学之风怎么看？”他答道：“是不公平的就业闹的！现在有些地方分配工作、招工并不看重知识。洋博士不也有待业的么？！人们于是觉得学也没劲。不过，我觉得读书是有用的，不公平的就业不是知识的过错，不能用社会的弊端惩罚自己，自私点儿说，不读书也太愚蠢了。”
    在图书出纳台，我们见到了一个从天津赶来查资料的研究生。他姓崔，２３岁，正在天津大学管理系攻读硕士学位。他说，“我已经来了三天，准备写一篇研究三峡工程投资政策的论文。我们学管理的，接触实际特别重要。但学校给学生提供的实践机会太少了，许多知识已经陈旧，学生没兴趣。读了十几年书，到用时还是觉得脑子空空。这种问题本应该由学校解决，现在只能靠我们当学生的去弥补教育上的缺陷了，否则就只好做牺牲品。”
    一位名叫万春侯的读者和我们聊得挺好。他１９５６年毕业于北京大学物理系，曾留学苏联，现在国家计委能源研究所工作。他说：“我来北图看书成了一种习惯。有的年轻人却不以为然，他们问我，‘你出版了几大本书，得了几次奖，比得上一个万元户么？’他们的想法可以理解。但我们这种年龄的知识分子却在想，该用什么来衡量一个民族的生存态度呢？”
