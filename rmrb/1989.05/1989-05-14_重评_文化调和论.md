The "Cultural Harmonization Theory" discussed in this article refers to the view during the May Fourth New Culture Movement that advocated for the harmonization or integration of China's traditional culture with Western modern culture.

Within the ranks of the New Culture Movement, there were indeed individuals who advocated for the harmonization or integration of Chinese and Western cultures. However, at that time, the majority of the arguments for "cultural harmonization" were directed against the "extremism" of the New Culture Movement. In fact, one of the main methodological approaches used to oppose the New Culture Movement was to advocate for harmonization. This is a historical case that has already been decided, and this article does not intend to overturn the verdict.

So, why is there a need for "re-evaluation"? The reason is as follows: Previous criticisms of the "Cultural Harmonization Theory" often focused on determining its essence as the preservation of old culture, which is somewhat simplistic. In reality, the "Cultural Harmonization Theory" of that time raised many profound questions regarding cultural relations. The proponents of the New Culture Movement correctly answered some of these questions in their refutations, but they also failed to answer or incorrectly answered some questions. Today, on the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, re-examining the debate over whether cultures can be harmonized will likely be beneficial for our country's cultural construction in handling the relationship between Chinese and Western cultures, as well as old and new cultures.

The New Developments in Cultural Conflicts in the Early Republic

Historical research on the early Republic of China has traditionally focused on politics, highlighting the failures of the revolution, the wars of the warlords, and the nation's plunge into disaster. However, the deeper social changes of that time have not received sufficient attention. In fact, after the Xinhai Revolution, social and cultural changes were both significant and rapid.

Cultural figures of the time were deeply aware of these changes and published various commentaries. In 1916, Du Yaquan, the editor of the Eastern Magazine, published an article under the pen name "Cang Fu," describing the new cultural conflicts of the early Republic. He believed that "today's so-called new things, compared to the past advocates of Western arts and new laws, have indeed progressed; even the so-called old things are not the same as those who viewed Europe and America as barbarians and condemned new learning as heresy." Based on this, he inferred that the trend of China's ideological conflicts would definitely be "towards the new," and the difference between the new and the old was merely a matter of "excess" and "deficiency" within the same direction of progress. The result of ideological conflicts should lead to "the mechanism of harmonious progress." Du Yaquan's view was one of the earliest forms of harmonization theory that emerged during the early stages of the New Culture Movement.

From the late Qing Dynasty to the early Republic, the conflict between Chinese and Western cultures underwent a unique process. From the Opium War to before the Hundred Days' Reform, those who advocated for the introduction of Western learning, whether it was the early Westernization faction or the reformists who gradually formed from the Westernization Movement, all discussed "foreign affairs," "Western affairs," and "Western learning" on the premise of firmly upholding the Chinese "Dao." They advocated for the principle of "Chinese essence, Western application," although their intention was to explain the necessity of "Western application." Therefore, these new factions that did not dare to advocate for "new" indeed had a "harmonization of Chinese and Western" color. At that time, the extreme conservatives, however, regarded all Western affairs and Western learning as "changing China with barbarians," deeply closed-minded and rejecting any possibility of harmonization. After the Hundred Days' Reform, the situation changed. The Qing court was forced to declare "reforms," and a large number of old faction figures gathered under the banner of "Chinese essence, Western application," but they emphasized the necessity of maintaining "Chinese essence." Nevertheless, the old faction had indeed retreated, retreating to the line of acknowledging that "Western learning" could be "applied." Therefore, it can be said that the old faction also began to have a "harmonization of Chinese and Western" color. After the Xinhai Revolution, the situation changed again. Although the revolutionary party still had speeches that sought revolutionary arguments from the teachings of ancient sages, the political platform of "democracy and republic" and the ideas of "liberty, equality, fraternity" had already shown a new culture completely different from the traditional ethics and teachings. It was in this historical context that the New Culture Movement, which was uncompromising and unharmonious, was formed to completely break with old culture. In the new situation, the main force opposing the New Culture Movement was no longer the princes and high officials who were ignorant of the surrounding world or the officials of the Westernization Movement who knew some superficial knowledge of the "West," but a group of intellectuals who were quite familiar with the cultural and scientific conditions of modern foreign countries. Therefore, they generally opposed the "extremism" and "radicalism" of the New Culture Movement with an impartial attitude, raising the banner of "cultural harmonization" to confront the proponents of the New Culture Movement.

It can be seen that the evolution of the conflict between new and old thoughts since the late Qing Dynasty is a very interesting two-way change. From the perspective of the spread of new thoughts, it developed from the "learning from the barbarians to control the barbarians" full of loyalty to the dynasty to the New Culture Movement that carried out a "fundamental cleansing" of old culture; from the perspective of the defenders of old culture, they retreated step by step under the attack of new thoughts, from blindly rejecting foreigners to gradually becoming advocates of compromise and harmonization.

"The Cultural Harmonization Theory" and the "Cultural Replacement Theory" Debate

Before the May Fourth Movement, the advocacy for learning and adopting Western culture generally tried to explain how Western culture conformed to the teachings of Chinese ancient sages, thereby proving that it was not heresy and could be accommodated. Even the more radical revolutionary party members could not escape this mode of thought. Only with the rise of the May Fourth New Culture Movement did China see another mode of thought, which believed that Chinese and Western cultures were incompatible and therefore could not be accommodated within Chinese culture, but only replaced by Western culture.

Chen Duxiu and others vigorously promoted this "Cultural Replacement Theory," whose theoretical contribution was to analyze cultural phenomena in terms of their historical context. The inaugural issue of New Youth clearly pointed out that "Eastern civilization" actually referred to China's traditional old culture, which was not suitable for the needs of the modern era and was a "relic of the past." The "Western civilization" people talked about was the modern civilization produced in Europe, characterized by human rights, the theory of biological evolution, and socialism, which was the product of completely destroying the old system. They firmly believed that "the new and the old cannot coexist, even more so than water and fire, ice and charcoal cannot be mixed," and that "the old must be fundamentally broken before the new can absolutely emerge." Using the concept of social development and historical progress to analyze the nature of culture, it provided the most important theoretical basis for the New Culture Movement, which aimed to thoroughly sweep away the feudal system and feudal ethics, thoroughly reform the national character shaped by feudal culture, and for the birth of the New Culture Movement marked by "democracy" and "science."

Facing the relentless impact of the New Culture Movement, the feudal remnants, apart from cursing, were at a loss. Those who rose to resist the New Culture Movement were the "Cultural Harmonization Theory." The initial arguments of this "Cultural Harmonization Theory" were quite simple: first, they did not acknowledge the difference between Western civilization and Chinese civilization as a matter of degree, thereby denying the necessity of replacement; second, they believed that the two civilizations each had their strengths and weaknesses, with China suffering from anemia and the West from hyperemia; third, they acknowledged that the contact between the two civilizations was inevitable, advocating that China should not be self-sealed, but could only "supplement its shortcomings with the strengths of the other," and that "harmonization and integration were inevitable." This harmonization theory was naturally not impartial, and as the debate deepened, its intention to maintain feudal ethics and social norms became completely exposed. Du Yaquan, one of the main representatives of the early "Cultural Harmonization Theory," explicitly advocated that "the way of the ruler and the loyalty of the subject, the ethics and teachings of the family" were China's "national essence." He said that Western civilization could indeed be "fully introduced," but it must be integrated with China's traditional civilization to "make it conform to our traditional civilization." He further said that if the strengths of China's traditional civilization were developed, "in the future, if we can integrate Western thought to unify the civilization of the world, it will not only save ourselves but also save the whole world." This argument indeed opened the way for Neo-Confucianism.

In essence, this "Cultural Harmonization Theory" was nothing more than a "Chinese essence, Western application" theory under new conditions. Its appearance, however, stimulated the proponents of the New Culture Movement to firmly criticize this harmonization proposal under the banners of democracy and science. However, it must be acknowledged that the "Cultural Harmonization Theory" indeed posed a difficult question for the New Culture Movement, the most important of which was: do Chinese and Western cultures indeed have their respective strengths and weaknesses, and can they be harmonized in a "complementary" manner? The proponents of the New Culture Movement did not scientifically answer this question. They emphasized that the evaluation of culture should change with the times, that Western culture, although not without flaws, should be adopted because it conformed to the needs of the times, and that Chinese culture, although it had its merits, should be abandoned because it did not conform to the needs of the times. Chen Duxiu, Li Dazhao, and Wu Yu, in their criticism of Confucianism, generally followed this logic to prove that Confucius was indeed a "great man of his time," but his thoughts were no longer suitable for modern life. This showed that the proponents of the New Culture Movement were not entirely radical in cultural issues. However, this argument still did not answer the question of whether China's traditional culture was entirely unsuitable for the modern era.

"The New and Old Mixing Theory" and the "New and Old Replacement Theory" Debate

The proponents of the New Culture Movement observed cultural issues with the concept of historical evolution, on the one hand, overcoming the mistake of comparing Eastern and Western cultures statically, and on the other hand, raising a big question of how to explain the development of culture from ancient to modern, from old to new. Especially since the new culture they advocated was an imported new culture, this further complicated the nature of the cultural development issue.

Chen Duxiu, in arguing that new and old cultures could not be harmonized, seemed to have realized the existence of this problem. Therefore, he specially explained that since the late Zhou Dynasty, scholarship could still yield gold from the sand, "but today's Europe, the prosperity of scholarship, far surpasses the past," and "we can directly adopt it," which "saves labor and yields more." This only explained that adopting modern European culture was more straightforward and effective, but the question of how new culture was formed and how it replaced old culture remained unsolved. Some opponents of the New Culture Movement saw this loophole and used the "new and old mixing" theory to challenge the New Culture Movement.

Soon after the May Fourth Movement, Zhang Shizhao successively delivered speeches, arguing that "new and old mixing" was the universal state of all things in the world. He said that the changes of the times could only be a process of "inheritance from generation to generation, uninterrupted," and there was no "completely new period" that had nothing to do with the old times, and no "new literature" that rejected everything old. From "old" to "new," it could only be a process of "transition rather than transcendence," and "today, occupying one part of the new, shedding one part of the old." Based on this, he asserted that any stage of the times could only be in a state of "new and old mixing." "New and old mixing" was "harmonization," so "harmonization is the most refined meaning of social evolution." Zhang Shizhao further argued from the perspective of "new" emerging from "old" the importance of "preserving the old." He said, "To advance, one must first establish a foundation. The old is the foundation. Without the old, there can be no new; without the ability to preserve the old, one cannot welcome the new; the harm of not welcoming the new is only stagnation, but the harm of not preserving the old is almost self-destruction." It must be acknowledged that he indeed grasped the one-sidedness of the proponents of the New Culture Movement, and coupled with Zhang's articles being more dialectical and logical than the general level at the time, its influence was foreseeable. Therefore, supporters of the New Culture Movement rushed to refute this new form of harmonization theory. Thus, the debate between the "new and old mixing theory" and the "new and old replacement theory" became a hot topic on the Chinese cultural forum in 1920.

The most powerful argument against the "new and old mixing theory" was to explain that the state of "new and old coexistence" was precisely a process of continuous evolution where the new squeezed out the old, which showed that the new and old that coexisted as one could not be harmonized, and it was a process of "new and old replacement." Therefore, acknowledging only "new and old mixing" and not acknowledging "new and old conflict" was a denial of progress.

The proponents of the New Culture Movement's criticism of the "new and old mixing theory" was to the point. However, they still left an unsolved methodological problem: if new and old cultures could not be harmonized, then how should old culture be treated in the establishment of new culture? Eliminate it? Reform it? Inherit it? Protect it? Or let it die out on its own?

Cultural Model Selection and Cultural Relationship Analysis

With the deepening of the capitalist crisis in the early 1920s, the focus of China's cultural debate gradually shifted to the path debate, directly answering the question of which path China should take. In other words, in the cultural debate at that time, most people were concerned with the question of which social system and political system China would choose.

This path debate, in terms of methodology, adopted a "model selection" approach. Radicals chose the Soviet socialist model and advocated for the path of the October Revolution; conservatives reconstructed the "Chinese cultural revival" model and advocated for the whole world to follow the "Confucian path"; of course, there were also those who defended the capitalist model and were determined to follow the "Western path."

The pros and cons of the path debate in the early 1920s need to be analyzed in a separate article, but the question here is: if the problem of choosing a path in politics must adopt a "non-this-or-that" approach, then in cultural construction, should this "model selection" approach also be adopted? The proponents of the New Culture Movement adopted this "cultural model selection" approach. As Chen Duxiu said, "Between the new and the old, there is absolutely no room for compromise and coexistence, and we can only choose one."

This way of looking at cultural issues was inseparable from the cultural model in the minds of the proponents of the New Culture Movement. In their view, old culture was China's own traditional culture, while new culture was modern European culture. Therefore, the cultural reform they advocated was not the self-evolution of Chinese culture but a "change" of culture. In this case, the issues of cultural continuity, tradition, inheritance, and so on were naturally excluded from their vision.

Without considering the historical conditions of the time, it is obviously wrong to regard this "cultural replacement theory" as a wrong turn. At that time, the New Culture Movement was able to fearlessly break the shackles of old traditions, which could not be unrelated to this approach. To say that the May Fourth New Culture Movement caused a rupture in Chinese culture is inconsistent with the facts; in fact, the May Fourth New Culture Movement brought about an unprecedented era of cultural development. However, logically speaking, using the "cultural replacement theory" to oppose the "cultural harmonization theory" would inevitably lead to the conclusion that the process of cultural development could be disrupted—that culture could be completely "changed." For this theoretical error, we should not cover up for the pioneers of the New Culture Movement.

Culture is a creation of humanity, but for all cultural creators, the existing culture is the base on which they create and stand, and it cannot be chosen or avoided. Zhang Shizhao's "new and old mixing theory" had many errors, but recognizing that the progress of culture is a process of "inheritance from generation to generation, uninterrupted" is undeniable. If the "new and old harmonization theory" did not correctly recognize the nature and significance of change in the process of cultural development, Chen Duxiu and others, in the process of criticizing the harmonization theory, precisely did not recognize the continuity of cultural development. Today, when we discuss cultural traditions, we often confuse whether traditions should be broken and whether traditions can be discarded, but these are two different things. No matter how radical the anti-tradition stance is, it cannot avoid inheriting some traditions. Of course, this is not to say that we should, like some scholars, re-enshrine Confucius as the "eternal teacher" of "truth in every word." Tradition cannot be completely discarded, but people have a lot to do in terms of utilizing and reforming tradition.

It is completely wrong to reduce the nature of the May Fourth New Culture Movement to "anti-tradition" and criticize it; it is also wrong to reduce the nature of the May Fourth New Culture Movement to "anti-tradition" and praise it. Only by fully inheriting the heritage of human culture can we have the possibility of cultural innovation on this basis. In this sense, it is not anti-tradition, but only by inheriting tradition can we talk about breaking tradition. In cultural construction, it is wrong to generally advocate for anti-tradition, as the destructive nature of the "Ten Years of Cultural Revolution" has shown, and there is no need to discuss it.

People should understand that ancient and modern, old and new cultures are essentially not unrelated different models, but a historical relationship. Because the proponents of the New Culture Movement opposed their own traditional culture with the imported modern culture, they naturally did not feel the need to examine the historical connection from old to new in their own culture. Some scholars say that the May Fourth New Culture Movement emphasized timeliness but neglected national characteristics. This judgment is reasonable. However, it should be said that this "neglect of national characteristics" was both a mistake and a progress in cognition. The proponents of the New Culture Movement began to understand that the history of human cultural evolution had commonality, which allowed them to break free from the narrow national perspective, observe the world with an open mind, and directly compare the timeliness of cultural advancement and backwardness. Therefore, they had the courage to "take" the advanced culture of foreign countries. The progress of modern Chinese culture has always been closely linked to breaking the "barbarian and Chinese" barrier. The question is whether to adopt an analytical attitude to examine the various complex components of Chinese and foreign cultures and their mutual relationships. In the issue of Chinese cultural construction, it is necessary to establish a new concept of "cultural relationship analysis" to correct the absolutism and rigidity of the "cultural model selection" concept. That is, in the relationship between ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign cultures, we should see both the conflicts and the realistic possibilities and rationality of exchanges and fusions. If we remove the meaning of patchwork and compromise that the concept of "harmonization" easily brings, then the "harmonization"—exchange and fusion, taking the strengths and compensating for the weaknesses of different cultures of different times and nations, is indeed the smooth path of human cultural development.

The cultural construction of the present era can only be achieved by opening up various channels to facilitate the smooth exchange and free "collision" of various types of cultures, drawing nourishment from them, discarding the rotten, and stimulating new life. The socialist cultural construction of China can only be realized in the great fusion of ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign cultures. From a global perspective, the phenomenon of cultural diversity will continue to exist for a long time. If we continue to view the problem according to the "model selection" approach, assuming that cultures with different characteristics must be incompatible and can only choose between "the moon in China is rounder than the moon abroad" and "the moon abroad is rounder than the moon in China," it is obvious that we will be against the tide of the times. In the future development of human culture, although various conflicts will still occur from time to time, the scale and speed of cultural exchange and fusion will continue to increase, and human culture will gradually approach the era of "great harmony."

　　重评“文化调和论”
    丁伟志
    本文评论的“文化调和论”，是指五四新文化运动中一种主张调和中国固有文化和西方近代文化的意见。
    新文化的营垒中，也有发表过主张中西文化应当调和或结合的人。不过，当时绝大多数主张“文化调和”的议论，都是针对新文化运动的“过激”而发的，甚至可以说，当时反对新文化运动的一种主要方法论，就是力主调和。这是一桩是非已判然的历史公案，本文无意于作翻案文章。
    那么，何以又要“重评”呢？理由如此：以往对于“文化调和论”的批评，多以判定其实质是维护旧文化为满足，未免失之于浅简。事实上，当年的“文化调和论”在文化关系问题上，提出了不少颇有深度的问题。新文化运动倡导者在反驳调和论时，正确地回答了一部分问题，但是也有一部分问题没有回答，或者回答错了。今天，在７０年后纪念五四，把当年文化能否调和之争的是非重新作一番考察，对于我国文化建设中如何处理中西文化、新旧文化的关系，大概会有所助益。
    民国初年文化冲突的新发展
    史学家关于民国初年的研究，历来多着眼于政治，所以看到的是：革命失败，军阀混战，举国陷于灾难。至于那时候社会深层的变化，则未受到足够的重视。其实，辛亥革命后的几年中，社会和文化变化都是非常显著而急遽的。
    当时的文化人对这种变化深有体会，发表过各种评论。１９１６年《东方杂志》主编杜亚泉以“伧父”笔名发表文章，对民国初年文化冲突的新形势亦颇多描述。他认为，“今日之所谓新者，较之曩时讲求西艺、倡言新法者，固有进步；即所谓旧者，亦非曩时视欧美为夷狄、斥新学为异端者，所可同日语矣。”据此他推论说，中国思想冲突发展的趋势必定是“日趋于新”，新旧之不同不过是“沿同一方向以进”中的“过”与“不及”的差别而已。思想冲突的结果应该引出“调和进步之机括”。杜亚泉的这种看法是新文化运动初起时较早出现的一种调和论。
    从晚清到民初，中国文化思想的冲突，经历了一个很独特的流程。从鸦片战争到戊戌变法之前，凡主张引进西学者，无论是初期的洋务派，还是从洋务运动中逐渐形成的维新派，都是在坚决维护华夏“道统”的前提下来谈“夷务”、办“洋务”、倡“西学”的。他们标榜的都是“中体西用”的建构原则，不过其用心都是在努力阐明“西用”之必需。因此，这些不敢标“新”的新派，确乎具有“调和中西”的色彩。而这时的极端顽固派，却是把一切洋务与西学一概斥之为“用夷变夏”的不规之举，深闭固拒，丝毫不容调和余地。戊戌以后，形势为之一变，清廷也被迫宣告“变法”，大批旧派人物于是便麋集到“中体西用”的大旗下，不过他们强调的乃是维护“中体”之必要了。尽管如此，旧派毕竟是退守了，退到不得不认可“西学”可“用”这条防线上。因此可以说，旧派也开始具有“调和中西”的色彩。辛亥革命之后，形势又为之一变。尽管革命党人还不乏从古圣先贤的遗训里找革命论据的言论，但是“民主共和”的政治纲领，“自由、平等、博爱”的思想，已经把一种和固有纲常名教完全不同的新文化昭示人间。正是在这样的历史背景下，形成了以不妥协不调和的誓与旧文化彻底决裂的新文化运动。在新的形势下，反对新文化运动的主力，已经不是那些对周围世界懵然无知的王公重臣和知道一些“西洋”皮毛的洋务大臣，而是一批相当熟悉近代国外文化与科学状况的知识分子。因此，他们除极少数全盘否定西方文化者外，一般是以不偏不倚的态度反对新文化运动的“过渡”与“偏激”，打起“文化调和”的旗帜与新文化倡导者对垒。
    可见，晚清以来新旧思想冲突的演变是一种十分有趣的双向变化。从新思想的传播一方看，是从那种充满对王朝忠诚的“师夷长技以制夷”，一步步发展成对旧文化实行“根本扫荡”的新文化运动；从旧文化的维护一方看，则是在新思想的进攻下，步步败退，从盲目排外，逐步变成力主折衷的调和论者。
    “文化调和论”与“文化取代论”之争
    五四以前提倡学习和采纳西方文化，论证的方法大致是努力解释西方文化如何符合中国古圣先贤的主张，借以证明它不是异端，可以酌情容纳。连那些激进的革命党人，也难逃此种思维模式。只有五四新文化运动兴起，中国才出现了另一种思维模式，认为中西文化是势不两立的，因此不能把西方文化容纳到中国文化中去，而只能是用西方文化来取代中国文化。
    陈独秀等努力提倡这种“文化取代论”，其理论贡献在于对文化现象进行了时代性的区分。《新青年》创刊号明确指出：“东洋文明”实际上指中国固有的古老文化，它是不适于现时代需要的“古之遗”。人们所说的“西洋文明”，则是产自欧洲的以人权说、生物进化论和社会主义为特征的“近代文明”，正是把旧制度破坏无余的产物。他们坚信，“新旧之不能相容，更甚于水火冰炭之不能相入”，“旧者不根本打破，则新者绝对不能发生”。用社会发展、时代进步的观念分析文化性质，它为彻底扫荡宗法制度、封建礼教，彻底改造在封建文化熏陶下形成的病态的国民性，为以“民主”和“科学”为标志的新文化运动的诞生，提供了最重要的理论依据。
    面对新文化运动的无情冲击，封建遗老遗少们除谩骂而外束手无策了，起来抗击新文化运动的是“文化调和论”。这种“文化调和论”，初期的论点非常简单：一，不承认西洋文明与中国文明的差异是程度的高低，从而否认有取代的必要；二，认为两种文明各有长短，中国患了贫血病，西洋患了充血病；三，承认两种文明的接触无法避免，主张中国不应自封自囿，但是只能“以彼之长补我之短”，“抱合调和，势所必至”。这种调和论，自然不是不偏不倚的，随着论争的深入，它维护封建伦理纲常的意向便完全裸露出来。“文化调和论”早期的主要代表者杜亚泉曾明确主张“君道臣节，纲常名教”才是中国的“国是”。他说，西洋文明固可“尽量输入”，但是必须靠着中国固有文明去“统整”，“使其能合于我固有文明之中”。他并且进一步说，如果发挥中国固有文明之特长，“今后果能融和西洋思想以统整世界之文明，则非特吾人之自身得以救济，全世界救济亦在于此。”这通议论，确实开了新儒学之先河。
    从实质上看，这种“文化调和论”无非是在新条件下的“中体西用”论。它的出现，反而激发了新文化运动倡导者在民主和科学的口号下坚决批判这种调和主张。但是，不能不承认，“文化调和论”确实给新文化运动提出了不易回答的难题，其中最主要的就是：中西文化究竟是不是各有长短，是不是可以进行“取长补短”式的调和？新文化运动倡导者没有能够科学地解答这个问题。他们强调说，对文化的评价要因时而异，西方文化虽不无弊端，但因其符合时代需要，应予吸取，中国文化虽自有长处，但因其不符合时代需要，只能弃绝。陈独秀、李大钊、吴虞等在批判孔学时，大都循此逻辑，证明孔子固为“当时之伟人”，然其思想已不适于现代之生活。这表明新文化倡导者，在文化问题上也并不是一味偏激。不过，这种说法仍旧未能解答中国固有文化，是不是一概不适用于现代的问题。
    “新旧杂揉说”与“新陈代谢说”之争
    新文化运动倡导者用时代进化的观念观察文化问题，一方面克服了把东西文化做静态比较的错误做法，另一方面却又引出了文化由古到今、由旧到新的发展应该如何解释这样一个大问题。特别是所言之新文化，是一种外来的新文化，这就更加增添了文化发展问题的错综复杂的性质。
    陈独秀在论证新旧文化不可调和时，似乎意识到了这个问题的存在，所以他特意解释说，晚周以来的学术，披沙也可以得金，“然今之欧罗巴，学术之隆，达迈往古”，“吾人直径取用”，“诚劳少而益多”。这只是说明采用欧洲近代文化较为简捷速效，至于新文化究竟是怎样形成和怎样取代旧文化的问题，仍旧未能解决。有些反对新文化运动的人看出这种漏洞，便以“新旧杂揉”之说，向新文化运动发起问难。
    “五四”以后不久，章士钊陆续发表演说，论证“新旧杂揉”乃世界万物所处的普遍状态。他说，时代的变化只能是“世世相承，连绵不断”的过程，不存在和旧时代“绝不相谋”的“崭新时期”，不存在“摈斥一切旧者”的“新文学”。从“旧”到“新”只能是个“移行而非超越的”过程，“今日占新面一分，蜕旧面亦只一分”。据此他断言，时代的任何阶段，都只能是处在“乍占乍蜕”的“新旧杂揉”状态中。“新旧杂揉”就是“调和”，所以说“调和者，社会进化至精之义也”。章士钊还进一步从“新”产生于“旧”的角度，论证“保旧”的重要性。他说，“凡欲前进，必先自立根基。旧者根基也。不有旧，决不有新，不善于保旧，决不能迎新；不迎新之弊，止于不进化，不善于保旧之弊，则几于自杀”。应当承认，他确实抓住了新文化运动倡导者的片面性，加之章氏文章的思辨性和逻辑性都超出当时一般水平，它造成的影响是可以想见的。因此，新文化运动的拥护者纷纷起来反驳这种新形态的调和论。于是，“新旧杂揉说”和“新陈代谢说”之争，成为１９２０年中国文化论坛上的一个热点。
    对于“新旧杂揉说”的批驳，最有力的论点是，说明“新旧共存”的状态正是“新的把旧的挤了出去”的不断进化的过程，它恰恰表明“共存一体”的新和旧是不能调和的，它是一个“新陈代谢”的过程。可见，只承认“新旧杂揉”，不承认“新旧冲突”，就是否认新的进步。
    新文化的倡导者对“新旧杂揉说”的批评是切中要害的。不过，他们在方法论上仍然留下了一个未能解决的难题：如果新旧文化根本不能调和，那么在建立新文化时，究竟该怎样对待旧文化呢？消灭它？改造它？继承它？保护它？还是凭它自生自灭？
    文化的模式挑选和文化的关系分析
    随着２０年代前期资本主义危机的加深，中国文化论争的重心逐渐转移到路向之争，即直接回答中国该走哪条路的争论上去。也就是说，在当时的文化论争中，多数人所关注的是中国将选择什么样的社会制度和政治制度的问题。
    这种路向之争，在方法上采用的是一种“模式挑选”。激进者选中了苏联社会主义的模式，力主走十月革命的路；保守者重构“中国文化复兴”的模式，力主全世界都走“孔家的路”；当然也还有百般回护资本主义模式，一心走“西方的路”的人。
    ２０年代前期的路向之争的是非，需要专文分析，这里要探讨的是：如果说政治上选择道路的问题，不得不采取“非此即彼”的办法，那么在文化建设上，是不是也得采取这种模式挑选的办法呢？新文化运动的倡导者采用的正是这种“文化模式挑选”的思路。正如陈独秀所说：“新旧之间，绝无调和两存之余地，吾人只得任取其一。”
    这种看待文化问题的方式，是与新文化运动倡导者心目中的文化模型分不开的。在他们看来，旧文化是中国自己固有的文化，而新文化却是欧洲近代文化，因此所要推行的文化革新，不是中国文化的自我演进，而是“换”一种文化。既然如此，文化的延续性问题、传统问题、继承问题，自然就都被排斥到他们的视野之外了。
    脱离开当时的历史条件，把这种“文化取代论”看成是误入歧途，显然是不对的。在当时，新文化运动所以能够无畏地去突破旧传统的束缚，不能不说与这种思路有关。说五四新文化运动造成了中国文化的断裂，是与事实不符的；事实上五四新文化运动带来的恰恰是一个前所未有的文化大发展的时代。不过从逻辑上说，用“文化取代论”来反对“文化调和论”，就不免推导出一个文化进程可以断裂的论断——文化可以无保留地“改弦更张”。对于这种理论上的失误，我们不应为新文化的先驱者讳。
    文化是人类的创造，但对一切文化创造者来说，既成的文化却是他进行创造、赖以立足的基地，无法选择与躲避的。章士钊的“新旧杂揉说”，固有种种错误，但认识到文化的演进是一个“世世相承，连绵不断”的过程，这是无可非议的。如果说“新旧调和论”没有正确认识文化进程中变革的性质与意义，陈独秀等在批判调和论的过程中，恰恰是没有认清文化发展的延续性质。我们今天在讨论文化传统的时候，常常把传统应否突破和传统能否摆脱混为一谈，其实这是两回事。再激烈的反传统主张，也不能不继承着某种传统。当然，这不是说要像有的学者把孔子重尊为“句句是真理”的“万世师表”那样。传统无法完全摆脱，然而对于传统的利用和改革，人们却是大有可为的。
    把五四新文化运动的性质仅仅归结为“反传统”而加以指责，是完全不对的；把五四新文化运动的性质仅仅归结为“反传统”而加以赞扬，同样也是不对的。只有充分地继承人类文化的遗产，才有可能在这个基础上进行文化的创新。在这个意义上说，不是反传统，而是只有继承传统，才谈得上突破传统。在文化建设上，笼统地标榜反传统，其破坏性之大，已有“文革十年”的历史在案，无须讨论。
    人们应该明白，古今、旧新文化本质上不是互不相干的不同模式，而是一种历史关系。由于新文化运动倡导者是把外来的近代文化拿来和自己的固有文化相对峙，自然就没有感到有必要去考察中国自己的文化存在着何种从旧到新的历史联系。有的学者说，五四新文化运动是重视了时代性，忽视了民族性。这个论断是有道理的。不过应当说，这种“忽视民族性”，既是认识上的一种错误，又是认识上的一种进步。新文化运动倡导者开始懂得人类的文化进化史是具有共同性的，才从狭隘的民族视野中解放出来，放眼观察世界，径直比较文化时代性的先进与落后。从而他们对外国的先进文化，才具有了敢于“拿来”的勇气。中国近代文化的进步，从来是与破“夷夏之防”紧紧联系在一起的。问题在于要不要以分析的态度去考察中外文化的种种复杂成份及其相互关系。在中国文化建设问题上，需要建立一种新型的“文化关系分析”的观念，用以矫正“文化模式挑选”观念所具有的绝对性和僵化性。也就是说，在古今中外的文化关系上，既要看到其间的冲突，又要看到其间交流融汇的现实可能性和合理性。如果去掉“调和”这个概念所容易引起的拼凑和妥协的意味，那么不同时代不同民族文化的“调和”——交流融汇，取长补短，正是人类文化发展的坦途。
    现时代的文化建设，只有靠疏通和开辟各种渠道，使各种不同类型的文化顺畅交流，自由“碰撞”，从中汲取营养，沙汰腐质，激励新生。中国社会主义的文化建设，只能在古今中外文化的大交融中实现。从世界范围看，文化的多元现象仍会长期存在。如果仍旧按照“挑选模式”的思路看问题，以为不同特色的文化间必定水火不容，只能在“中国的月亮比外国的圆”和“外国的月亮比中国的圆”之间进行“非此即彼”的挑选，显然只能和时代潮流背道而驰。人类文化今后的发展过程中，虽然还不时会出现这样那样的冲突，但是文化交流融汇的规模和速度必将与日俱增，人类文化总是要一步步逼近“大同”之期。
