The Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, Zhao Dong'e, stated at the conclusion of the National Personnel Work Conference today that, with the approval of the State Council, the overall requirement for local institutional reform work this year is to combine it with the rectification and adjustment work, and to seriously grasp the control and management of institutional staffing and the preparation for institutional reform.

It is reported that the State Council has approved the specific deployment for local institutional reform work this year as follows:

	— Conduct in-depth investigations and research, and formulate institutional reform plans. Emphasize the transformation of functions, the streamlining of relationships, the adjustment of structures, and the reduction of personnel. Make comprehensive plans for the institutional reform of government departments at the provincial, municipal, and county levels, and organize research and draft the basic ideas and specific plans for the institutional reform of provincial-level and separately planned municipal governments. This work is required to be completed by the end of this year or the beginning of next year.

	— Conduct partial adjustments to local institutions. Local authorities can conduct partial adjustments to local institutions based on their actual situations, but such adjustments must comply with the principles and directions of institutional reform and must not increase the number of institutions and staffing. Avoid new expansions due to partial adjustments, which would create obstacles for future reforms.

	— Strictly control the expansion of institutional staffing and do a good job of "slimming down" the offices. Local authorities must strictly implement the staffing quotas and must not arbitrarily increase the number of personnel, the number of leaders, or the level of cadre appointments. The focus should be on doing a good job of "slimming down" the office personnel.

	— Conduct pilot reforms of local institutions. In cooperation with relevant provinces and cities, the Ministry of Personnel has designated Hebei Province and Harbin City as pilot cities for provincial-level and separately planned municipal institutional reforms. The pilot reforms of medium-sized cities that began in the first two years of the provinces and cities will continue; the pilot reforms of county-level institutions will be conducted in counties such as Zhuozi, Gaocheng, Yuanping, Qiongla, Huaxian, and Huacheng.

The State Council also requires that central departments should actively support the preparation work for local institutional reforms and should not interfere with local institutional settings and personnel staffing through means such as leadership speeches, meeting minutes, or issuing documents.

　　国务院批准地方机构改革部署    
    中央各部门不要以各种方式干预
    据新华社南京５月１３日电（记者费强）人事部部长赵东宛在今天结束的全国人事工作会议上说，经国务院批准，今年地方机构改革工作的总要求是结合治理整顿工作，认真抓好机构编制的控制管理工作和机构改革的准备。
    据介绍，国务院批准的今年地方机构改革工作的具体部署是：
    ——深入调查研究、制订机构改革方案。着重转变职能、理顺关系、调整结构、精简人员，对省、地（市）、县各级政府部门机构改革作全面规划，组织研究和拟订省级和计划单列市机构改革的基本思路和具体方案。这项工作要求在今年年底或明年初完成。
    ——对地方机构进行局部性的调整。各地可根据本地的实际情况对地方机构进行局部性的调整，但这种调整必须符合机构改革的原则和方向，不得扩大机构数量和编制数量，避免因局部调整而造成新的膨胀，为今后的改革设置障碍。
    ——严格控制机构编制膨胀，作好机关“消肿”工作。各地要严格执行编制定员，不得随意扩大人员编制，增加领导人数，提高干部配备级别。要重点做好机关人员的“消肿”工作。
    ——搞好地方机构改革试点。经人事部同有关省、市协商，确定河北省、哈尔滨市为省级和计划单列市机构改革的试点，省、市前两年开始的中等城市机构改革试点继续进行；县级机构改革试点将在卓资、藁城、原平、邛崃、滑县、华容等县进行。
    国务院在批准上述部署时还要求中央各部门应积极支持地方机构改革的准备工作，不要以领导讲话、会议纪要、发文件等方式干预地方的机构设置和人员编制配备。
