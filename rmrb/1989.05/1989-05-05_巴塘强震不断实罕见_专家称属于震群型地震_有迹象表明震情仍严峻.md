	Unprecedented Strong Earthquakes Continue in Batang
	Experts Identify It as a Swarm-Type Earthquake
	Signs Indicate the Earthquake Situation Remains Severe

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 5 (Reporter Tang Hong) - In the span of 18 days, the Batang region of Sichuan Province's Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture experienced four earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher. This rare phenomenon of continuous strong earthquakes has drawn significant public attention. The reporter visited relevant experts from the State Seismological Bureau regarding this matter. The experts believe that the Batang earthquake is a rare swarm-type earthquake in seismic history.

	Four experts who recently returned from the Batang earthquake zone first introduced the situation on the ground to the reporter. From April 16, 5:34 AM, to May 4, 9:31 AM, the Batang region experienced 10,160 earthquakes of magnitude 1 or higher, 2 earthquakes of magnitude 5 to 5.9, and 4 earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher, with two of them reaching 6.7.

	The experts said that the earthquake situation in the Batang region is extremely complex, surpassing our current understanding of earthquake types. After careful and repeated analysis and research, the consensus is that these continuous major earthquakes are of the "swarm-type earthquake" category. Swarm-type earthquakes refer to the combination of multiple relatively large earthquakes. Looking at China's seismic history, mainshock-aftershock type or double-shock type earthquakes are more common. The situation in Batang, where four earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher and two of magnitude 5 or higher occurred in such a short period, is rare both domestically and internationally. The complexity of the situation has made short-term prediction of these major earthquakes very challenging.

	Why did the Batang region experience continuous strong earthquakes? The experts said that while in-depth research on relevant data is ongoing, it is currently difficult to provide a scientific explanation. However, they pointed out that historically, the Batang region and its surroundings have experienced multiple earthquakes of magnitude 6 or higher. The current seismic activity remains abnormal, and there are many macro-anomalies in Sichuan. Various signs indicate that the seismic situation in this region remains severe. Currently, experts are closely monitoring the seismic activity in Batang and its surrounding areas and are conducting ongoing research.

　　巴塘强震不断实罕见
    专家称属于震群型地震
    有迹象表明震情仍严峻
    据新华社北京５月５日电  （记者唐虹）四川省甘孜藏族自治州巴塘地区１８天内连续发生４次６级以上地震，这种罕见的连续强震现象引起了社会关注。记者就此走访了国家地震局有关专家。专家们认为，巴塘这次地震是属于地震史上少有的震群型地震。
    刚从巴塘地震区归来的四位专家，首先向记者介绍了震区现场情况。自今年４月１６日５点３４分至５月４日９点３１分，巴塘地区发生１级以上地震１０１６０次，５至５．９级地震２次，６级以上地震４次，其中有两次是６．７级。
    专家们说，这次巴塘地区的地震，震情非常复杂，超越了我们目前对地震类型的认识。经过周密反复的分析和研究，现在比较一致的看法是：这几次连续大震属于“震群型地震”。所谓震群型地震是指连续多个较大地震的组合。纵观我国地震史，主余震型或双震型地震居多，像这样在同一地区，短短十几天时间内连续发生４次６级以上、２次５级以上地震的情况，国内外都是少见的。震情的复杂，给这几次大震的短临预报造成很大困难。
    巴塘地区为什么连续发生强震？专家们说，由于对有关资料正在进行深入研究，目前尚难作出科学解释。但是，他们指出，历史上巴塘及周围地区曾多次发生６级以上地震，现在这一地震活动仍不正常，四川地区的宏观异常现象也比较多。种种迹象表明，这一地区的地震形势仍然是严峻的。目前，专家们正在对巴塘及外围地区的地震活动进行严密监视，并在不断进行研究。
