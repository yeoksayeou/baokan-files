The "Yitale" classic car, at the age of 96, puffed and strained, its eyes wide open, as it struggled down from the "Roof of the World" at the Red Mountain Pass into Pakistan. Although the Pakistani reception team was already there to greet them, the expedition team faced harsh weather and treacherous mountain roads. Even though it was May, the temperature here was still around -10°C, with occasional blizzards.

Upon entering Pakistan, the Pakistani side added to the caravan's splendor—a brightly decorated, multicolored covered wagon leading the way. The caravan managed to reach the border town of Gilgit, where the sky was overcast with thick clouds and snowflakes were falling. The Pakistani side urgently dispatched people to repair the roads, and the caravan was held up in Gilgit.

However, the invitation to the welcoming ceremony and press conference for the expedition team in the capital, Islamabad, had already been sent out for May 5th. On May 5th, the caravan was still stranded in Gilgit, and the reception had to proceed as scheduled.

On May 8th, the caravan, led by the "Yitale" classic car, rolled into Islamabad in a grand procession, greeted by the cheers of the citizens lining the streets.

On the morning of May 9th, after being repaired and polished, the "Yitale" looked radiant as it slowly drove out of the pavilion and set off on its journey to Lahore. Lahore is a historic city in Pakistan, and the road from Islamabad to Lahore is excellent. The "Yitale" also regained its vigor, speeding along at 90 kilometers per hour, and arrived in Lahore in just 5 hours.

The expedition team departed from Lahore at 6 AM on May 11th, heading towards Multan. The journey was smooth sailing from there, and they reached the western border city of Quetta via Sukkur on the 13th. The team leader, Tanti, expressed confidence in reaching Paris by the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution on June 27th. Now, the caravan has departed from Quetta and is heading towards Iran.

　　“伊塔拉”老爷车在巴基斯坦
    本报记者  任毓骏
    ５月１日，９６岁高龄的“伊塔拉”老爷车喘着粗气，瞪着双眼，艰难地从“世界屋脊”上的红其拉甫山口进入巴基斯坦。虽然巴方接待人员已经迎候在那里，但这支远征队面临的却是恶劣的气候和惊险的山路。虽然时至５月，这里的气温依然在零下１０℃左右，不时有暴风雪袭击。
    一进入巴基斯坦，巴方又给老爷车队增添了风采—由一辆装饰得五颜六色的大篷车引路。车队好不容易开到边城吉尔吉特，这时天空阴云密布，雪花飞扬。巴方紧急派人前往修路，车队受阻于吉尔吉特。
    然而，首都伊斯兰堡为远征队于５月５日举行欢迎会暨记者招待会的请柬已经发出。５月５日，车队依然受困于吉尔吉特，招待会不得不如期召开。
    ５月８日，以“伊塔拉”老爷车为首的车队浩浩荡荡开进伊斯兰堡，受到市民的夹道欢迎。
    ５月９日晨，经过检修和擦拭的“伊塔拉”容光焕发，缓缓驶出彩棚，登上了前往拉哈尔的征途。拉哈尔是巴基斯坦历史名城，从伊斯兰堡到拉哈尔的道路极好。“伊塔拉”也恢复了神风，以每小时９０公里的高速奔驰，只用了５个小时就安抵拉哈尔。
    远征车队于５月１１日晨６时离开拉哈尔驶往木尔坦，此后一路顺风，又经苏库尔于１３日到达巴基斯坦西部边城基达。队长坦蒂表示有信心在６月２７日法国大革命２００周年纪念日之前到达巴黎。现在，车队已从基达出发，正向前往伊朗的途中行进。
