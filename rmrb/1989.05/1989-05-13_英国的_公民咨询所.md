In the UK, almost every community has a "Citizens' Advice Bureau." When citizens encounter issues such as purchasing poor-quality products, dissatisfaction with home repair services, disturbance from neighbors' noise preventing rest, or difficulty filling out various government forms, they can seek help from the "Citizens' Advice Bureau."

The "Citizens' Advice Bureau" in the UK was established during World War II and has been in existence for half a century. Initially, the bureaus, funded by central and local governments, primarily assisted citizens in dealing with various practical difficulties caused by the war, such as power outages, leaks, food shortages, and medication shortages. Today, the free consultation services provided by the bureaus have greatly expanded: they not only guide citizens on how to apply for benefits, how to protect their consumer rights, and how to sue, but also explain citizens' rights and relevant legal provisions to visitors.

Ninety percent of the bureau's staff are unpaid volunteers, the majority of whom are middle-aged and young women. Their political leanings and economic backgrounds vary greatly. Before taking up their roles, they generally undergo rigorous training and are well-versed in various British laws and regulations. More commendably, they never refuse any citizen's request for help, and they handle problems, regardless of their size, with seriousness and attention to detail.

Although the "Citizens' Advice Bureau" is generally praised by the public, it occasionally faces criticism. For instance, in 1983, the Conservative Party government accused the bureau of excessive political interference and threatened to reduce its funding. However, relevant investigations confirmed that the bureau's outstanding work had "won the hearts of the people," leading the government to apologize. Recently, under pressure from an increasing number of homosexual visitors, the bureau advocated for companies to hire homosexuals and criticized some institutions for "discriminating" against homosexual employees. Given the spread of AIDS, which has made homosexuality increasingly unpopular, the public is generally disappointed that the bureau has yielded to the "tyranny" of homosexuals.

### 英国的“公民咨询所”

　　英国的“公民咨询所”
    在英国，几乎每个社区都设有“公民咨询所”。男女公民们在日常生活中如遇到诸如买到劣质产品、上门的修理服务不称心、受到邻居噪声的干扰而无法休息、不会填写政府发下的五花八门表格等“难题”时，便可上“公民咨询所”求助。
    英国的“公民咨询所”诞生于二次大战期间，距今已有半个世纪了。不过，由中央和地方政府资助的“咨询所”在当时仅仅只是帮助公民解决战争带来的种种实际困难，如断电、漏雨、缺粮、少药等。而今天，“咨询所”提供的免费咨询服务已大大扩展：不仅指导公民们如何申请福利、如何保护自己的消费权、如何打官司等，还向来访的公民解释公民权和有关的法律条文。
    “咨询所”的工作人员百分之九十系不拿薪的志愿人员，其中又以中青年妇女居多数。政治倾向、经济背景却大有不同。她们一般在任职前都接受过严格的训练，对英国的种种法令了如指掌。更值得称道的是，他们从不拒绝任何公民的求助，求助的问题也不论大小巨细一律认真予以解释或解决。
    尽管“咨询所”受到公众普遍的赞赏，但不时也会引起非议。如一九八三年保守党政府就责备“咨询所”过分干涉政治，并威胁说将削减对“咨询所”的资助。但有关的调查却证实：“咨询所”因工作杰出而“深得民心”，于是政府不得不作了道歉。但最近，“咨询所”迫于与年俱增的来访的同性恋者的压力，主张企业雇佣同性恋者，并批评有些机构“歧视”同性恋雇员。鉴于艾滋病的泛滥使同性恋越来越令人厌恶，公众对“咨询所”屈服于同性恋者的“淫威”普遍感到失望。
