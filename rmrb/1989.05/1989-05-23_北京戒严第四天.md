Beijing Under Martial Law on the Fourth Day

The bustling public buses on the streets yesterday morning brought smiles to the faces of the capital's residents. On the fourth day since the imposition of martial law, Beijing's social order continued to stabilize, with the vast majority of citizens remaining calm and composed, and life gradually returning to normal.

Starting yesterday, over 100 bus routes in the capital have resumed operation. The subway, which had been suspended for more than three days, also began running again at 10:38 AM. With the help of students and citizens, the city's streets were mostly clear, and workers commuted to and from work as usual. Vehicles transporting coal, liquefied petroleum gas, and meat, eggs, vegetables, and milk were given special attention.

On Tiananmen Square, students who had been camping overnight began cleaning the area at dawn. Amid the national anthem playing loudly, some students saluted the rising national flag. The protesting students announced that they would withdraw the public buses parked on the square (originally used by fasting students) and allow the bus company to resume normal operations.

In the afternoon, tens of thousands of people marched along Chang'an Avenue. Among the marchers, some well-known figures were spotted. As dark clouds gathered and thunderstorms rolled in, citizens rushed to provide various rain gear to the marchers.

After the rain, the temperature on Tiananmen Square dropped sharply, and large quantities of warm clothing and ginger tea were delivered to the students. By 9 PM, 4,000 pieces of clothing donated by a central government agency had been distributed to the students.

According to Central People's Radio and Television, the troops tasked with enforcing martial law were mostly stationed outside the city.

As night fell, many citizens concerned about the situation found it difficult to sleep.

    天安门广场上，沉睡了一夜的请愿学生黎明即起，洒扫周围场地。在高声播放的国歌声中，一些同学向冉冉升起的国旗行注目礼。请愿学生广播，同意撤出停在广场上公共汽车（原来供绝食学生用），由公交公司投入正常营运。
    下午，长安街上出现了数以万计的游行队伍。游行队伍里，有人认出了一些知名人士。在黑云压城、雷电交加的大雨中，市民纷纷给游行队伍送来各式雨具。
    雨后的天安门广场，气温骤降，大批寒衣和姜糖水送到学生手中。某中央机关捐赠的４０００件衣服，不到晚９点已分发到学生手中。
    据中央人民广播电台和电视台报道，执行戒严任务的部队大都停在城外原地。
    入夜，街头仍有许多关切事态发展的市民难以入睡……
