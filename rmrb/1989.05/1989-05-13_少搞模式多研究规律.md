Title: Less Emphasis on Models, More on Studying Laws

At a national conference, I saw a document that recommended enterprise management experiences from various regions to the central authorities. It listed a long series of "models": such as the "guarantee method" of a certain place, the "work method" of another, the "control method" of yet another, the "model method" of another, the "management method" of another, and so on.

I feel that some people seem to have developed a "model mania." What are originally general and specific work experiences and enterprise management methods must be given a new and fresh name, labeled with some kind of "method," and promoted as a "model" for others to follow.

The merits and demerits of these management methods need not be discussed here. The question is, how effective is it to easily elevate specific practices to the level of a "model"? Since conditions vary from place to place, how effective is it to simply copy someone else's model?

Chen Qingtai, the general manager of the Second Automobile Works, once said that implementing layer-by-layer economic contracting within the enterprise did not yield good results, and it was better to implement a layer-by-layer responsibility system. Cui Honglu, the factory director of the Qilu Ethylene Plastics Weaving Factory in Zibo, Shandong, believes that enterprises should choose a comprehensive management method that suits their own situation, and that an enterprise cannot be managed well by relying on a single model.

There are tens of thousands of enterprises nationwide, and these enterprises are vastly different. It is unrealistic to seek a unified national enterprise management model. However, some comrades and supervisory authorities have spent too much effort in seeking and promoting certain models.

The result of this is that enterprise personnel feel that it is like when someone was teaching farmers how to farm a few years ago. For the past few years, higher authorities have been instructing them on how to manage, making enterprises unable to adapt.

In addition, this kind of "summarization" and "promotion" is often an invisible administrative intervention, bringing about consequences for enterprise reforms that are not only ineffective but can also be said to be disruptive.

Research on enterprise management is undoubtedly very necessary. It can be said that research in this area is still quite weak at present. However, this research should first focus on seeking enterprise management laws with Chinese characteristics, so that managers understand the reasons behind them. As for specific methods, they should be flexibly created by each enterprise according to its own situation.

　　少搞模式多研究规律
    谷声
    在一个全国性会议上，我见到一份材料，是向中央推荐各地企业管理经验的，其中列举了一大串“模式”：诸如某某“保证法”、某某“工作法”，某某“控制法”，某某“模特法”、某某“管理法”，等等。
    我觉得一些人似乎染上了一种“模式癖”，本来是一般的具体的工作经验和企业管理方法，一定要冠以一个新鲜的名词儿，封上个什么“法”，并作为一个“模式”，让其他的地方效法。
    这些管理办法其优劣利弊如何，无须在此评论，问题是轻易地把具体的作法上升到“模式”，到底效果怎样。各地情况不同，照搬别人的模式，效果又如何。
    二汽集团总经理陈清泰就曾说，在企业内部搞层层经济承包效果不好，不如搞层层责任制。山东淄博市齐鲁乙烯塑编厂厂长崔洪禄则认为，企业应根据自己情况选择较为适宜的综合管理办法，企业不可能靠某个模式就可以搞好。
    全国有成千成万的企业，这些企业千差万别，企图寻求一种全国统一的经营管理模式，是不现实的。然而我们有些同志和主管机关，却在寻求和推广某种或某些模式上花了过多的功夫。
    这样做的结果，企业界人士感到，就像当年有人在教农民怎样种田似的，这几年上级部门一直在指示他们如何如何管理，使企业无所适从。
    再加上这种“总结”和“推广”又往往是一种无形的行政干预，给企业改革带来的后果不止是无益，而且还可以说是一种干扰。
    企业管理的研究无疑是十分需要的。应该说，现在这方面的研究还相当薄弱。但这种研究首先应该着重寻求具有中国特色的企业管理规律，使管理者知其所以然，至于具体方法，则应靠各个企业根据情况自己去灵活创造。
