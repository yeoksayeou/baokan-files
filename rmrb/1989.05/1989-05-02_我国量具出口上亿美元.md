China's small but precise scales have become a favorite measuring tool in many households abroad due to their affordability and quality. Over the past year, various types of measuring instruments produced in China have been sold to many countries and regions, including Europe, America, Hong Kong, Macau, and Africa, with export transactions exceeding $1.6 billion.

Before 1983, China's production of measuring instruments was quite backward, and the country had to spend a large amount of foreign exchange to purchase some advanced measuring instruments each year. However, in just five years, China's research and production of measuring instruments have made remarkable progress. In fields such as electronic testing, infrared radiation testing, and metrological monitoring, China has reached or is close to reaching the world's advanced level.

　　我国量具出口上亿美元
    本报讯  我国生产的小小天平由于价廉物美已成为国外许多家庭喜爱的计量工具。一年多来，我国的各类计量器具已销往欧美、港澳和非洲等许多国家和地区，出口成交额已超过１．６亿美元。
    １９８３年前，我国的计量器具生产十分落后，国家每年要花大量外汇购买一些先进的计量器具。时隔５年，我国计量器具的科研和生产得到了飞速发展，其中电子测试、红外线辐射测试、计量监测等领域已接近和达到世界先进水平。
