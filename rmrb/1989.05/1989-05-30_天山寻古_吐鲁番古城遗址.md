From Urumqi, heading east, passing through the yellow-green grasslands and the silver-white salt lakes, crossing the famous windy pass of Dabancheng, and driving through the vast and endless Gobi Desert, one enters the fertile and beautiful Turpan Basin.

It is the season for harvesting grapes, and every household's courtyard is filled with grapevines laden with green jade-like grapes. Young Uyghur women, dressed in vibrant clothing, are happily picking the grapes. On the hillsides, one can see many airy rooms made of mud bricks, used for drying grapes.

Around 11 a.m., we arrived at Jiaohe Ancient City. As the car climbed up the high city walls along a path at the bottom of the valley, we were all astonished: all around, there were ruins of earthen walls, standing tall and short, casting shadow like a stone forest under the sun—this was a dead city from before the 14th century! From the remnants, one could still clearly distinguish the main streets, alleys, workshops, residences, and halls within the city. The main halls, courtyards, corridors, passages, and staircases could still be seen. Especially a temple covering an area of 5,000 square meters, which still preserved high walls, a courtyard, a pagoda, and a deep, unfathomable well. Everything that was full of life 600 years ago is still vivid today, but it is now "dead," quietly lying under the sun, with no plants or greenery, not even a blade of grass.

How come all the buildings here are made of mud? We were surprised to discover that the entire city was actually dug from the ground. The alleys were actually dug-out blocks, and the wide streets were actually large trenches. Walking on the main street, the four to five-meter-high walls on both sides revealed layer upon layer of undisturbed original soil. The high halls of the temple were also built with mud bricks, and even the central column-style pagoda inside the temple was made of mud bricks! How could these mud-built structures endure the vicissitudes of several hundred years?

It's hot! Being in this dead city is like being in a steamer. The scorching heat seeps out from the white walls everywhere. In the morning, someone in Urumqi was still wearing a sweater, but now only a wet undershirt could be wrung out. Can't stand it anymore, let's drive! Everyone quickly got into the hot car, but Xiao Jing was late—he had discovered a miracle. In the vast expanse of gravel, there were several underground tombs dug four to five meters deep. On the platform, two mummies were displayed! Except for the bodies being completely dried by the wind, the facial features were still clear and intact, with hair still present. It is said that in the ancient tomb area under the Gobi Desert, there are thousands of such mummies—this is another Turpan mystery.

Around 4:30 p.m., the car drove into the ruins of Gaochang Ancient City, the capital of the ancient Gaochang Uyghur Kingdom, which is much larger than Jiaohe City and therefore more magnificent. The city layout is orderly and strict, with alleys, squares, "Khan's Fortress," and large temples, all in ruins. However, the golden-decorated luxurious halls that the great Tang monk Xuanzang saw when he passed through here and gave a lecture for the enthusiastic King of Gaochang are now gone.

To the north of the city is the legendary Flame Mountain. The exposed red sandstone and the winding gullies make the mountain appear heavy and majestic. It is said that at noon under the direct sunlight, the red mountain body is filled with rolling heat waves, and red smoke billows and swirls, looking like flames burning. Just as the Tang Dynasty border poet Cen Shen described the scene: "Red flames burn the barbarian clouds, and the scorching air fills the sky."

The setting sun cast a golden-red glow over the battlements, ruins, and the distant Flame Mountain. A small stream flowed through the ruined earthen city, heading towards the endless oasis in the basin. Two shepherds were leisurely herding a flock of white, curly-haired sheep. All of this seemed to bring a bit of life back to the dead city. We were always unsure of our feelings: was time frozen? Or was the life of history continuing?

    天山寻古
    ——吐鲁番古城遗址
    廖奔
    由乌鲁木齐向东，经过黄绿色草原上银白色的盐湖，闯过著名风口达坂城，驰过一望无际的茫茫大戈壁，就进入富饶美丽的吐鲁番盆地。
    正是葡萄收获的季节，家家庭院中的葡萄架上都挂满绿色的翡翠。身穿艳丽服装的维族少女在愉快地采摘。山坡上到处看得见一座一座用土坯搭成的、砌花透空的阴室，那是用来晾葡萄干的。
    上午11点钟左右，我们来到交河故城。当汽车沿着谷底一条踏道爬上城堡的高处时，我们都惊呆了：四望到处是土墙的残垣断壁，高矮残阙地耸立着，在阳光下投射出石林般的阴影——这是一座14世纪前的死城！从残迹中还能清晰地辨别出哪是城中的主街道，哪是坊、巷、作坊、民宅，殿宇中还可看出主室、天井、围廊、甬道、台阶，尤其是一座占地5000平米的寺院，还保存了高大的院墙、广场、佛塔和深不可测的土井。一切600多年前充满生机的东西，今天仍然历历在目，只是，它已经“死”了，静静地躺在阳光下，没有植物和绿色，草也不长一根。
    这里的建筑怎么都是泥土构成的呢？我们惊奇地发现，整座城市竟然是从地面挖下去的，坊、巷实际上是挖出的条块，宽阔的街道实际上是挖出的大沟。走在大街上，两侧四五米高的坊墙，显露出一层一层未经扰乱的原生土层痕迹。寺庙高大的殿堂则是土坯垒成的，连寺里中心柱式的佛塔，也是用土坯砌的！这些泥土垒起的建筑，怎么能够阅历几百年的沧桑？
    热！处在死城里，就像在蒸笼中一样。炎炎热气从白花花的土墙里到处渗出来。早上在乌鲁木齐有人还穿了毛衣，这会儿只剩件背心还湿得能拧
  出水。受不住了，快开车吧！大伙儿急忙钻进滚烫的车厢，可小景迟迟才来——他竟然发现了一个奇迹。在大片的戈壁砾石中，掏有一个个四五
  米深的地下墓穴。土台上赫然陈示着两具干尸！除了躯体全部被风干了之外，面部轮廓还清晰整齐，毛发俱存。据说，在古墓区的戈壁底下，睡着几千具这样的干尸——这又是一个吐鲁番之谜。
    下午4点多钟，汽车开进了高昌故城，这是高昌回鹘国的国都，比交河城大得多，因而更加宏伟壮观。城中布局规整严谨，坊巷、广场、“可汗堡”、大寺院，遗迹俱在。只是，当年大唐圣僧玄奘路过此地，为盛情款待的高昌王开坛讲经时，那黄金装饰的豪华大屋顶已经无影无踪了。
    城的北边，就是传说中那神奇的火焰山。裸露的红土砂岩，道道曲折的冲沟，使山体显得滞重雄浑。据说中午在阳光的直射下，红色山体热浪滚滚，红色烟云蒸腾缭绕，望去恰似团团烈焰在燃烧。正如盛唐边塞诗人岑参所描写的景象：“赤焰烧虏云，炎氛蒸塞空。”
    夕阳斜下，将城堞、残垣以及远处的火山都抹上了一层金红。一条小渠从残阙的土城中淙淙地穿过，流向盆地一望无际的绿洲。两个牧童赶着一群白色的卷毛羊，悠闲地归牧。这一切，使死城似乎恢复了一点活力。我们始终弄不准自己
  的感觉：究竟是时间被凝固了
  呢？还是历史生命力在延续？
