Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 2nd.

A personal representative of PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat, Issam Salim, was seriously injured today in an ambush in the southern Lebanese city of Sidon.

Salim is a senior PLO official in Lebanon. Police said he was shot while driving through a street by masked gunmen. Salim was hit in the head. Police said his chances of survival were slim.

No one has yet claimed responsibility for the incident.

Salim is the second of Arafat's senior aides to be targeted in Sidon in the past four days.

On April 29, the official spokesman for the PLO's Fatah movement, Zaid Wehbe, had his residence in Sidon attacked with a rocket. Wehbe himself escaped unharmed.
