To quickly change the backward situation, China's railways need a significant increase in quantity, a substantial improvement in quality, and new technological breakthroughs. Technological progress is an important way for railways to get out of difficulties. Its key tasks are:

1. Develop heavy-haul transportation and significantly increase freight capacity. Actively research and promote the use of high-power electric and diesel locomotives. Develop 60-ton or more large freight cars and 60 kg/m or more heavy rails. Gradually operate 5,000-ton freight trains, and operate 6,000-10,000-ton unit heavy-haul trains on coal transport lines. Operate 7,000-8,000-ton combined trains on busy main lines when necessary. Increase the average train weight from 2,211 tons to 2,900 tons.

2. Significantly increase passenger capacity and study high-speed passenger transportation technology. Develop new types of passenger electric and diesel locomotives, double-decker passenger cars, and new braking systems. Operate high-speed express passenger trains with a maximum speed of 140 km/h on the three main lines. Develop and apply advanced passenger service facilities such as electronic ticketing, passenger guidance, and baggage management.

3. Reform transportation organization.

4. Strengthen soft science research and improve macro-decision making.

　　依靠科技进步
    铁道部科技局高级工程师  赵鸣九
    为了尽快改变落后状况，我国铁路需要数量上的大发展，质量上的大提高，技术上的新突破。科技进步是铁路走出困境的重要途径之一，它的重点任务是：
    一、发展重载运输，大幅度提高货运能力。积极研制、推广使用大功率的电力、内燃机车。发展６０吨以上大型货车及６０公斤以上重型轨道。逐步开行５０００吨货物列车，运煤专线开行６０００—１００００吨单元重载列车，繁忙干线必要时开行７０００—８０００吨组合列车。列车平均牵引重量由２２１１吨提高到２９００吨。
    二、大幅度提高客运能力，研究高速客运技术。研制新型客运电力、内燃机车、双层客车及新型制动系统。在三大干线开行最高时速１４０公里的特快旅客列车。开发应用电子售票、旅客向导、行包管理等先进旅客服务设施。
    三、改革运输组织。
    四、加强软科学研究，提高宏观决策水平。
