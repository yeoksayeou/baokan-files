Farmers Hire a Household Secretary

    The People's Daily reports: In Shangliang Township, Lingtai County, Gansu Province, farmers Yang Zhihui and Yang Zhigang, brothers who run the "Xinxing Woodenware Factory" and the "Soft Padding Factory," publicly hired a household secretary.

    Last September, after the Yang family's advertisement for a household secretary was posted on the streets, within just five days, more than 20 people applied. Among them were high school graduates, village and commune cadres, unemployed youth, and retired cadres. Yang Zhihui and Yang Zhigang conducted various forms of examinations, including written tests, oral interviews, and debates, for the applicants. Finally, they decided to hire Jing Hongru, a retired cadre with many years of experience in secretarial work, to be their household secretary.

    With this capable manager, Yang Zhihui and Yang Zhigang have more time to focus on production and management.
