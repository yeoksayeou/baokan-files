Who wants to know what it feels like for students to be without textbooks? Then, please listen to us talk about the various troubles we've experienced over the past few years due to a lack of textbooks.

Our school's senior year (high three) first semester was short of nearly 21 sets of textbooks, and the junior year (high two) was short of several dozen English textbooks. The freshmen (high one) were even more unfortunate. Last semester, by September 10th, each student only received 3 new books: history, algebra, and physics. It wasn't until October 15th that we received the English, language, and political science textbooks. However, the chemistry textbooks for 4 classes only amounted to 21 books, and geometry textbooks were only issued 50 or so. This semester, more than 10 days after the start of the semester, each student only received one history book. Despite the fact that all 224 students in our grade waited for a month, the belatedly arrived textbooks only amounted to 120 language books and 150 political science books.

Now, let's look at the consequences of our lack of textbooks. Last semester, in the first half of the month, due to the absence of political science books, we only wrote one social investigation essay. After the books arrived, the teacher quickly finished the textbook content, leaving students dizzy and confused, learning in a muddled state. Language arts was also a new edition, and before the books arrived, the teacher blindly taught a few lessons, which were mostly deleted in the new edition, inadvertently increasing the students' burden. The mathematics teacher had no choice but to skip geometry lessons in the first half of the semester. When it was close to the exam, the teacher hurriedly taught one chapter when it became clear that the books would not arrive in time.

We have repeatedly inquired at the bookstore, but the only answer we received was one word: wait.

Due to the delayed issuance of textbooks, our schoolmates are in a predicament where they want to learn but can't, and they want to stop but can't bear to. Three years of time is precious to us. If we continue to wait like this, how much knowledge can we learn!

### 课本——千呼万唤不出来

　　课本——千呼万唤不出来
    谁想知道学生没有课本的滋味？那么，就请听我们说说这几年因缺少课本带来的种种苦恼吧。
    我校高三年级第一学期共缺课本近２１套，高二年级英语课本也差了几十本。高一更倒霉，上学期到９月１０日，每人仅发３本新书：历史、代数、物理。１０月１５日才发了英语、语文、政治课本，而化学教材４个班才发了２１本，几何也只发了５０多本。这学期开学１０多天后每人才发一本历史书。尽管我们全年级２２４人等了一个月，姗姗来迟的只有１２０本语文、１５０本政治。
    请再看我们缺少课本的后果。上学期，在头一个半月内，由于没有政治书，我们只写了一篇社会调查。书到后老师又闪电般地将课本讲完，学生听得晕头转向，学得糊里糊涂。语文也是新编教材，未到书之前，老师盲目地上了几课，而这在新教材中又多被删去，无形中增加了学生的负担。数学老师上半学期不得已不上几何课，到了临考时见书等不到才忙乱地讲了一章。
    我们曾多次向书店询问，但得到的答案只有一个字：等。
    由于课本迟发，我校同学落到了欲学不能、欲罢不忍的境地。３年时光对我们来说是宝贵的，再这样等下去，我们能学到多少知识呢！
