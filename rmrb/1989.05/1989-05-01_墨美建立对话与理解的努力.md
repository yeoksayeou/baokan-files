The joint meeting of the Mexican and U.S. Congresses declared that they would engage in sustained cooperation, dialogue, and understanding between the two countries. On sensitive issues such as immigration and drug trafficking, which have been contentious for a long time, the meeting adopted some of Mexico's views and positions. The joint statement of the two countries' congresses showed broad agreement.

The chairman of the U.S. congressional delegation, DeLauro, quoted the late former Mexican President Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, saying, "Geography makes us neighbors, history makes us friends." However, this phrase is not as famous as another statement made by a former Mexican president who also had the surname Díaz: "Mexico is too far from God and too close to the United States." However, this historical relationship seems to be quietly moving towards more dialogue and understanding in the new situation.

There have always been many points of contention in U.S.-Mexican relations. Currently, the main issues are debt, trade, immigration, and drug trafficking. Of Mexico's total foreign debt of $10.03 billion, 66% is owed to U.S. banks. Over the past six years, Mexico has paid $4 billion in interest, with most of the funds flowing back to the United States. The introduction of the Brady Plan indicates that the United States has begun to realize that debtor countries cannot achieve economic growth without reducing capital outflows and debt principal and interest. They also cannot continue to repay debts, which will only force more debtor countries to join the anti-debt ranks. At the same time, the United States is Mexico's main trading partner. Due to Mexico's return to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, it has lifted more than 80% of import restrictions. However, this unilateral economic opening has hit the wall of U.S. protectionism. For this reason, Mexico has long called for the United States to open its market to Mexico on an equal basis, allowing Mexico to expand exports, create jobs, and solve related immigration problems. Similarly, Mexico has its own difficulties with the drug trafficking issue. In 1988, Mexico spent 440 billion pesos on cracking down on domestic and transnational drug trafficking from South America, with this year's budget reaching 1220 billion pesos. Mexico has always believed that this is caused by the sustained high consumption of drugs in the U.S. market. This time, the U.S. congressional delegation accepted Mexico's views and positions, recognizing that Mexican workers migrating to the U.S. is due to the supply and demand relationship of labor between the two countries and various economic factors. They should respect their human rights and labor rights and promote cooperation between the two governments in solving this problem. The legislators of the two countries also expressed that they should cooperate and make joint efforts in the production, trafficking, and consumption of drugs, and promote the establishment of an intergovernmental committee to control drugs. Such dialogue and understanding are rare in the relations between the two countries. At the same time, as this is the first direct dialogue between the legislative bodies of the two countries, people are optimistic about further understanding between the two countries. However, the problems between Mexico and the United States are historically formed by the accumulation of complex economic, social, and cultural factors, and cannot be solved merely through dialogue. Long-term efforts between the two countries are still needed.

　　墨美建立对话与理解的努力
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥与美国议会联席会议声称要在两国间进行持久的合作、对话与理解，而且在移民、反贩毒等两国争吵已久的敏感问题上采纳了墨西哥的一些观点与立场，两国议会会议在公报中表现出广泛的一致。
    美国议会代表团主席德拉加萨引用墨西哥已故前总统古斯塔沃·迪亚斯的话形容两国关系说：“地缘使我们结邻，历史使我们交友”。但是，这句远不如墨西哥历史上另一位也姓迪亚斯的总统所说的另一句话出名：“墨西哥离上帝太远，离美国太近。”但是，这种历史关系在新形势下，似乎悄悄走向更多的对话与理解了。
    美墨关系一直存在着许多芥蒂。就目前来说，主要是债务、贸易、移民与贩毒问题。墨西哥总共１００３亿美元的外债中，６６％是欠美国银行的。近６年来，墨西哥付出４００亿美元债息，其中大部分资金回流美国。布雷迪计划的提出表明美国开始认识到，债务国不减少资金外流与债务本息，根本就没有经济增长可言，也不可能继续偿债，只会逼迫更多的债务国加入抗债的行列。同时，美国又是墨西哥的主要贸易伙伴。由于墨西哥重返关税及贸易总协定，已经取消了８０％以上的进口限制。但是这一单方面的经济开放却撞在美国的保护主义壁垒上。为此，墨西哥一直呼吁美国对墨西哥对等开放市场，使墨扩大出口，创造就业，解决与此有关的移民问题。同样，墨西哥对贩毒问题也有苦衷。１９８８年，墨西哥用于查禁本国及南美洲过境贩毒的费用达４４万亿比索，今年预算高达１２２万亿比索。墨西哥一直认为这是美国市场对毒品的持续高消费造成的。这次，美国议会代表团接受了墨西哥的观点与立场，认识到墨西哥劳动者向美移民是由于两国对劳动力的供求关系及诸多经济因素引起的，应该尊重他们的人权与劳动权，推动两国政府在解决这一问题上的合作。两国议员还表示，在禁止毒品生产，贩运与消费的各个环节上应进行共同的合作与努力，推动两国政府成立一个控制毒品的政府间委员会。这种对话与理解在两国关系中是少见的。同时，由于是两国立法机构进行的第一次直接对话，使得人们对两国间的进一步理解表示乐观。然而，墨美之间的问题是由于经济、社会、文化等复杂因素的积累历史地形成的，不可能仅仅通过对话就能解决，还有待于两国间的长期努力。
