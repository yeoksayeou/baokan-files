	For the purpose of avoiding social unrest,
	the Philippine government crisis committee decided
	that if Marcos dies, his body will not be allowed to return.

	The New China News Agency reported from Manila on May 22nd:
	The Philippine government crisis committee, at a meeting held today, made a "final resolution" not to allow former President Marcos to return to the country, and if he dies, his body will not be allowed to be transported back to the Philippines.

	Acting Press Secretary Adolfo Ascona said at a press conference held at the presidential palace that, considering the possibility of social unrest, the government still does not agree to Marcos returning to the country.

	According to the U.S. hospital in Hawaii, the 71-year-old Marcos is currently in critical condition. The Philippine right-wing opposition has recently demanded that the government lift the ban on Marcos returning to the country. They believe that a person who is about to die will not pose any "serious threat" to President Corazon Aquino.

　　为避免引发社会动乱
    菲律宾政府危机委员会决定
    如马科斯去世遗体不准运回
    新华社马尼拉５月２２日电  菲律宾政府危机委员会在今天召开的会议上作出一项“最后决议”，不准前总统马科斯回国，如果他去世，也不准把遗体运回菲律宾。
    代理新闻秘书阿道弗·阿斯科那在总统府举行的新闻发布会上说，鉴于考虑到可能出现社会动乱，因此仍不同意马科斯回国。
    据美国夏威夷医院方面说，今年７１岁的马科斯目前生命垂危。菲律宾右翼反对党近来要求政府取消关于不准马科斯回国的禁令。他们认为，一个快要死的人不会给科·阿基诺总统带来任何“严重威胁”。
