The United Nations is concerned about the situation in Namibia and urges South Africa to withdraw troops quickly.

Our reporter Liu Kai Cheng reports from the United Nations on May 4: United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today expressed "serious concern" about the recent situation in Namibia at a consultation meeting of the UN Security Council.

UN spokesman Giuliani said today that de Cuéllar met with South African Ambassador Jeremy Sherrard yesterday afternoon, demanding that South African troops return to their bases as soon as possible. He also requested that the South African colonial authorities take all necessary measures to restrain the behavior of South African police to ensure the smooth implementation of the Namibia peace plan.

Giuliani explained that recently, the tripartite commission of South Africa, Cuba, and Angola, with the United States and the Soviet Union as observers, issued a communiqué in Cape Town requiring South African troops to return to their bases by May 13. De Cuéllar believes that South African troops in Namibia should return to their bases immediately because the Secretary-General is responsible for the deployment of the UN assistance team in Namibia and the organization of free and fair elections. He does not want to delay the peace process in Namibia.

　　联合国关注纳局势    
    敦促南非尽快撤军
    本报联合国５月４日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天在联合国安理会磋商会上对纳米比亚最近形势表示“严重关切”。
    联合国发言人朱利亚尼今天说，德奎利亚尔昨天下午约见南非大使杰里米·希拉尔，要求南非军队尽快回到基地，并要求南非殖民当局采取一切措施约束南非警察的行为，以保证纳米比亚和平计划顺利进行。
    朱利亚尼解释说，最近，美、苏作为观察员出席的南非、古巴和安哥拉三方联合委员会在开普敦发表的公报要求南非军队在５月１３日前回到基地。德奎利亚尔认为，纳米比亚的南非军队现在就应当回到基地去，因为秘书长对联合国援助团在纳米比亚的部署和组织自由和公正的选举负责，不希望拖延纳米比亚和平进程。
