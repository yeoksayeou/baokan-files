Facing danger without fear, striving for victory without slacking off, being open-minded and straightforward, and possessing great wisdom that seems simple. Wisdom shines through a humble demeanor, and sincerity is not without humor. These words can be used to describe our chess master Nie Weiping, can they not?

The outstanding stand out in their own way.

The final match of this year's "Ying Cup" is a contest between the top figures in the world of Go. It is reported that the wife of Cho Hun-hyeon, Jeong Mi-hwa, prayed at Lingyin Temple for her husband's victory. Nie Weiping's supportive wife, Kong Xiangming, prepared an oxygen tank, ready to provide oxygen to Nie at any moment. After one game, Cho Hun-hyeon smoked three packs of cigarettes, while Nie Weiping used oxygen three times. The intensity of the battle is evident. However, facing the stern situation of "either ruling or being ruled," Nie still sat casually at the table playing cards with his friends, showing a calm demeanor that truly commands respect. In the first match, he lost but remained "unperturbed," his calmness leaving a deep impression on the spectators; in the second match, he won and answered the TV reporter's questions with such frankness that it seemed a bit "arrogant." This is the style of old Nie.

Nie Weiping is human, not a god, and cannot win every battle. Failure is always lurking. For him, he is well aware of the dangers of the battlefield and the inevitability of failure. What is admirable is that every time he faces a major battle, he always goes into battle with the belief of victory, fighting with the courage of a general, placing victory and defeat aside, and fusing his chess skills, courage, and confidence into one. This transcendent composure allows his superb chess skills to be fully displayed. This is the essence of old Nie's style.

　　面对胜负说气度
    晨星
    危难不惧，好胜不怠，豁达坦荡，大智若愚。憨态中露出智慧，坦诚中不乏幽默。用这样的话来概括我们的棋圣聂卫平，不知当否？
    佼佼者自有佼佼处。
    本届“应氏杯”决赛，为当今世界围棋顶尖人物的较量。据报道，曹薰铉夫人郑美和在灵隐寺求佛保佑其夫君获胜。聂卫平的贤内助孔祥明则操守氧气瓶，时时准备聂君吸氧。一盘棋下来，曹薰铉吸烟三包，聂卫平吸氧三次。战况激烈可见一斑。然而，对“要么做主，要么称臣”的严峻形势，聂君照旧大大咧咧地坐在桌前和哥儿们打牌，临战不惊的气魄，委实使人佩服。第一局比赛他失利了，却“若无其事”，冷静之状，使观者难忘；第二局比赛他赢了，回答电视台记者的问话时，坦率得使人感到有点“狂”。这就是老聂的风格。
    聂卫平是人非神，不可能百战百胜。失败，随时随地都等着他。对他来说，何尝不知征战的艰险，失败之不可免。令人折服的是他每遇大战，总是抱着必胜的信念披挂上阵，以勇冠三军的气概全力奋战，把胜负置之度外，熔棋艺、胆识、信心于一炉。这种超凡脱俗的气度，使其高超的棋艺得以发挥。这正是老聂风格的真谛。
