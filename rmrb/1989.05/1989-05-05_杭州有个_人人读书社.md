Hangzhou has a "Everyone Reads Book Society"

The rapidly increasing price of books makes it difficult for ordinary people to afford them, and public library facilities in cities and rural areas are scarce, leading people to lament the difficulty of reading.

In August of last year, the Zhejiang Library became the first public library in the country to establish a "Everyone Reads Book Society" open to the public, offering a glimmer of hope to solve the problem of libraries becoming mere "book storage rooms" due to insufficient funds.

The Zhejiang Library, established in 1903, had ten times as many books by 1988 as it did at the beginning of the liberation, but the storage space had only increased by less than one-fold. This forced tens of thousands of books and periodicals to be bundled and stored away, with another 150,000 books "moved" to a vegetable warehouse in the suburbs. The Zhejiang Library, serving over 40 million people in the province, has only issued around 30,000 borrowing cards over the years, with only about 10,000 still in use.

The "Everyone Reads Book Society" of the Zhejiang Library was born out of this difficult reading environment. The society stipulates that every citizen of Hangzhou, regardless of age, can obtain a borrowing card by paying a rental fee of five yuan. "Taken from the readers, used for the readers" is the principle of the society. The book society uses the rental fees from readers to purchase books, magazines, pay rent, and salaries for staff. The self-sustaining book society, to expand its reader base and increase rental income, has established eleven lending and circulation stations in Hangzhou, evenly distributed in the east, south, west, and north of the city, conveniently located in densely populated and easily accessible residential areas, allowing readers to obtain cards and borrow books nearby. The society and circulation stations are open for borrowing from 7:30 AM to 6:00 PM every day, including Sundays. Readers can exchange books in one minute. As long as one person obtains a card, the whole family can use it, and even colleagues and friends can share it. Due to the convenient borrowing procedures and long service hours, the book society issued over 10,000 cards in just half a year, serving over 300,000 readers, exceeding the annual number of readers at the Zhejiang Library. The book society meets the needs of readers at different levels, and this endeavor is thriving.

### 杭州有个“人人读书社”

　　杭州有个“人人读书社”
    日见飞涨的书价令老百姓望而却步，而城乡的公共图书文化设施又是寥若晨星，人们叹息“读书难”。
    去年八月，浙江图书馆在全国公共图书馆中第一个建立起了面向大众的人人读书社，为解决我国图书馆因经费匮乏，而变成“藏书楼”的难题，燃起了一星希望之火。
    建于一九○三年的浙江图书馆到一九八八年藏书已是解放初的十倍，而藏书面积仅增加不到一倍。迫使数以万计的书刊被捆扎打包，束之高阁，还有十五万册书籍被“请”进市郊的某蔬菜仓库。面向全省四千多万大众的浙江图书馆多年来只发出过借书卡三万多张，至今仍在使用的仅万余张。
    浙江图书馆的“人人读书社”是在这种读书难的困境中应运而生的。人人读书社规定，每一位杭州公民，无论长幼，只要交纳五元租金，就可以领取一本借书证。“取之于读者，用之于读者”是办社的方针，读书社用读者租金购置书籍、杂志，支付房租和工作人员工资。自负盈亏的读书社为扩大读者面，增加租金来源，在杭州建立了十一个借阅流通站，遍布市区的东南西北，均衡地散布在人口密集、交通便利的居民点上，使读者可以就近领证就近借阅。书社和流通站每天早七时半到晚六时全天借阅，星期日也不间断。读者可以以书易书，一分钟就能办完借阅手续。只要一人领证，全家可享用，甚至同事朋友也可分享。由于借阅手续简便，服务时间长，读书社开办半年就发证上万个，接待读者三十多万人次，超过浙江图书馆全年的读者量。读书社满足了不同层次的读者需求，这项事业正蒸蒸日上。
