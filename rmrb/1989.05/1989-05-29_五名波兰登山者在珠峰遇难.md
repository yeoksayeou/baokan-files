Five Polish mountaineers recently met with misfortune during an ascent of Mount Everest.

On May 24, Polish athletes E. Hrobak and A. Marciniak successfully reached the summit of Mount Everest via the West Ridge. Three days later, these two athletes, along with four other Polish athletes, were descending back to the approximately 7,200-meter-high Camp Three when they encountered a massive avalanche. Z. A. Heinlich, M. Donsar, M. Gardzielewski, and W. Otręba were killed instantly. The leader of this international mountaineering team, E. Hrobak, succumbed to his severe injuries on May 28. A. Marciniak was also injured and is currently stranded at the 6,000-meter-high Lhose Valley beneath the West Ridge. At present, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs is maintaining direct radio communication with the mountaineering team and is attempting to provide them with all possible assistance.
