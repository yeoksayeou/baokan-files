Greenpeace today issued a warning that the Soviet nuclear submarine, which sank near the Norwegian coast on April 7, may cause serious nuclear pollution in the North Sea, with the contamination period possibly lasting tens of thousands of years.

According to a report drafted by nuclear experts and released by Greenpeace, the nuclear fuel on the Soviet submarine has a radioactivity level of 20 million curies, equivalent to the nuclear waste of 50 civilian nuclear reactors or one-third of the nuclear radiation released during the Chernobyl nuclear accident.

Greenpeace estimates that if the submarine is not salvaged, more serious nuclear pollution will affect marine life and human health for even tens of thousands of years.

Meanwhile, Norwegian officials said that no signs of pollution from the submarine have been detected so far.

    苏沉海核潜艇威胁严重   
    污染期可能将达数万年
    新华社伦敦５月２日电  绿色和平组织今天发出警告说，４月７日在挪威海岸附近沉入海底的苏联核潜艇有可能对北海造成严重核污染，污染期可能将达数万年。
    据绿色和平组织公布的一份由核专家起草的报告说，苏联核潜艇上的核燃料放射性强度高达２０００万居里，相当于５０桶民用核反应堆的核废料，或相当于切尔诺贝利核事故时核放射量的１／３。
    绿色和平组织估计，如果不将核潜艇打捞上来，更严重的核污染将在甚至几万年里影响海洋生物和人类健康。
    另据挪威官方人士说，目前尚未发现核潜艇发生污染现象。
