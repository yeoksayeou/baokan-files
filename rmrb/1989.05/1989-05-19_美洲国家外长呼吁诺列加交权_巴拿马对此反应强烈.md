Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 18th.

The 21st meeting of the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States passed a resolution last night calling on the leader of Panama, Noriega, to transfer power to "democratic institutions."

The resolution stated that the participating foreign ministers entrusted the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago with an emergency mission to promote the implementation of a national reconciliation plan in Panama. This plan will transfer power through democratic mechanisms, fully respecting the independence wishes of the Panamanian people, and do so in the shortest possible time.

The resolution warned the Panamanian government to fully implement this resolution and called on all political forces in Panama to exercise restraint to prevent the situation from worsening.

The ministers also called on countries not to interfere in the internal affairs of others.

Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, May 18th.

The resolution passed by the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States has sparked different reactions in Panama. The ruling party in Panama believes that this resolution interferes with its internal affairs, while the opposition party thinks it reflects the people's aspirations.

The foreign ministers of the Organization of American States held a meeting in Washington on May 17th, passing a resolution calling on the commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega, to transfer power to "democratic institutions," and deciding to send the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guatemala to Panama to mediate.

Daniel Espino, the general secretary of the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party of Panama, stated on May 18th that the resolution passed by the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States reflects that this organization has been interfered with by the United States and is an interference in Panama's internal affairs. He believes that this resolution is "contradictory" because it talks about non-interference on one hand, while on the other hand, it criticizes Noriega.

Panama's foreign minister believes that this resolution does not include any condemnation.

The official newspaper of Panama, "La Republica," published an article stating that the Panamanian people oppose the Organization of American States sending a mission to this country.

The presidential and vice-presidential candidates of the opposition Democratic Alliance in Panama stated in a declaration on May 18th that the foreign ministers of the Organization of American States have clearly condemned the current government and decided to send a mission to Panama. This is what the Panamanian people have been expecting.

The opposition declaration pointed out that it is unimaginable to achieve democratization and transfer of power in Panama before Noriega steps down as commander of the Defense Forces.

According to reports, the Panamanian security authorities issued a statement on the afternoon of May 18th, calling on citizens to be vigilant against the new escalation of U.S. provocations.

　　美洲国家外长呼吁诺列加交权    
    巴拿马对此反应强烈
    新华社华盛顿５月１８日电  美洲国家组织第２１次外长会议昨晚就巴拿马局势通过一项决议，呼吁巴领导人诺列加将权力移交给“民主机构”。
    决议说，参加会议的外长们委托厄瓜多尔、危地马拉、特立尼达和多巴哥的外长执行一项紧急使命，促成一个巴拿马全国调解方案的实现。这一方案将通过民主机制、充分尊重巴拿马人民的独立愿望、在最短的时间内进行权力移交。
    决议告诫巴政府要全面执行此项决议，并呼吁巴拿马各派政治力量采取克制态度，防止事态恶化。
    部长们还呼吁各国不要干涉别国内政。
    新华社巴拿马城５月１８日电　美洲国家组织外长会议所通过的决议在巴拿马各界引起不同反应。巴拿马执政党认为此项决议干涉了巴内政，而反对党却认为这反映了人民的期望。
    美洲国家组织外长１７日在华盛顿举行会议，通过决议呼吁巴国防军司令诺列加将权力移交给“民主机构”，并决定派厄瓜多尔、特立尼达和多巴哥、危地马拉３国外长去巴拿马斡旋。
    巴拿马执政党民主革命党总书记丹尼尔·埃斯皮诺１８日指出，美洲国家组织外长会议通过的决议反映了这个组织受到了美国的干预，也是对巴拿马内政的干涉。他认为这项决议是“矛盾的”，因为它一方面谈到不干涉，而另一方面又指责诺列加。
    巴拿马外长认为，这项决议没有写上关于谴责之类的话。
    巴拿马官方报纸《共和国报》发表文章指出，巴拿马人民不同意美洲国家组织向这个国家派遣使团。
    巴拿马公民反对派民主联盟总统和副总统候选人在１８日的声明中说，美洲国家组织外长明确地谴责了现政府，并决定向巴拿马派遣一个使团。这是巴拿马人民的期待。
    反对派声明指出，在诺列加没有辞去国防军司令之前，在巴拿马实现民主化和移交权力是不可思议的。
    另据报道，巴拿马安全机构１８日下午发表公报，要求公民对美国挑衅的新的升级保持警惕。
