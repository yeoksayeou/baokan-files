The Communist Party of China's Fujian Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission recently informed relevant news organizations about the situation regarding the construction and occupation of the "Secretary's Mansion" by Zhang Wenliang, Secretary of the Zhangzhou Municipal Committee.

Comrade Lin Kaijin, a member of the Provincial Committee and Secretary of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, said that in March of this year, the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission received letters from various parties regarding Zhang Wenliang's occupation of the "Secretary's Mansion" and other related matters. The Provincial Committee leadership issued instructions, requiring the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission to investigate and handle the matter. The Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission conducted a thorough investigation and study, and the issue of the "Secretary's Mansion" has been basically resolved. It is believed that Zhang Wenliang violated the relevant regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council regarding cadre housing, and he was sternly required to correct his mistakes. Three opinions were proposed: first, he must reflect on his mistakes; second, he must move out immediately; third, the housing department will arrange where he will move to, and he should not interfere.
