The severe problem of fake exports of refrigerators

In March of this year, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade released a piece of news that was exciting: in 1988, China exported 907,240 refrigerators. However, at the same time, reporters learned from the customs and the Ministry of Light Industry that the actual number of refrigerators exported last year was only 150,000 units (including 26,000 whole units, with the rest being industrial, household, and civilian use refrigerators). Why is there such a huge discrepancy between these two numbers? What exactly is going on?

Reporters learned from relevant departments that the so-called "export" of 900,000 refrigerators that created foreign exchange earnings was mostly circulating within the country and did not actually leave the customs. This is what insiders refer to as the "fake export" phenomenon.

The specific manifestations of fake exports are twofold:

First, customers with foreign exchange in hand purchase refrigerators from the Overseas Chinese Service Department, Friendship Stores, or seafarers' clubs of foreign shipping companies, using shopping vouchers. These refrigerators are not all original imports; some are produced by domestic manufacturers (such as Qingdao-Liebherr and Wanbao brand refrigerators). This part accounts for a small proportion in fake exports.

The second type is the use of refrigerators as a medium for "speculating" on foreign exchange. During the peak production and sales seasons of spring and autumn, some foreign trade companies flock to refrigerator manufacturers, purchasing refrigerators under the guise of exports at relatively low international market prices. Then, a significant portion of these refrigerators are sold at high prices in inland areas, earning profits in the process. Each refrigerator can earn approximately $200.

This "fake export" trick allows production enterprises to complete their tasks, foreign trade companies to make money, and ultimately, the country suffers the loss.

### 电冰箱假出口情况严重

　　电冰箱假出口情况严重
    今年３月，经贸部传出令人振奋的消息：１９８８年我国电冰箱出口为９０．７２４万台。然而与此同时，记者从海关、轻工业部获悉，去年电冰箱实际出口仅有１５万台（其中整机出口２．６万台，包括工业用、家用、民用冰箱）。这两个数字何以相差如此悬殊？这到底是怎么回事？
    记者从有关部门了解到，所谓“出口”创汇的９０万台冰箱，绝大部分只是在国内流通，并未真正出海关。这就是行家所说的“假出口”现象。
    假出口的具体表现有两种：
    其一是手头有外汇的顾客，到出国人员服务部、友谊商店或外轮公司海员俱乐部挟购物指标购买的冰箱，并非都是原装进口的，其中就有国内厂家生产的冰箱（如琴岛—利勃海尔、万宝等名牌冰箱）。这部分在假出口中所占比例不大。
    另一种是以电冰箱为媒介的“炒”汇现象。每逢春秋产销旺季，一些外贸公司便纷纷来到电冰箱厂家，以出口名义，用较低的国际市场价收购冰箱，然后把相当大一部分以高价在内地售出，从中牟利。一台冰箱约赚２００美元。
    一出“假出口”的把戏，使得生产企业完成了任务，外贸公司赚了钱，最终吃亏的却是国家。
