U.S. President Bush departs for Europe to attend NATO summit, consult with allies on East-West relations

	Washington, May 26 (Xinhua) — U.S. President Bush left Washington this morning on a week-long visit to Europe. This is Bush's first trip to Europe since taking office.

	According to the plan, Bush will attend the NATO summit from May 28 to 30 and make brief visits to Italy, Belgium, West Germany, and Britain. During his visit, Bush will consult with allies on East-West relations and NATO strategy issues to bridge the gap between the U.S. and Europe on short-range nuclear weapons.

	Rome, May 27 (Xinhua) — U.S. President Bush arrived in Rome last night for an official visit to Italy. Today, Bush met with President Cossiga and held talks with Prime Minister De Mita, exchanging views on the NATO summit and other issues.

	Italy is the first stop for Bush's visit to Europe as U.S. President. Upon his arrival in Italy, Bush emphasized that Italy is a "permanent and loyal ally," and that this visit demonstrates the United States' "respect and high evaluation" of Italy.

	Local media believe that Bush's European trip aims not only to change his image of being overly cautious but also to assess the extent of the "Gorbachev effect" within the Atlantic Alliance and to seek a compromise among allies on the issue of short-range nuclear missiles. According to the Evening Post, at the NATO summit in Brussels, Bush may, based on accepting the Soviet Union's positive proposals on reducing conventional weapons, present a systematic plan to promote negotiations to the allies. The message Bush wants to convey to Gorbachev may involve three points: first, unilateral reduction of U.S. troops in Europe (according to U.S. reporters accompanying Bush on his European trip, a 10% reduction, or 34,000 troops); second, including aircraft in limited Vienna talks; third, clearly demanding that the Soviet Union accelerate negotiations and reach an agreement within the next four years.

	President Bush will visit the American Cemetery and Memorial in Nettuno, the landing site of U.S. troops during World War II, to participate in a memorial activity tomorrow.

　　布什出访欧洲
    出席北约首脑会议　同盟国磋商东西方关系
    本报华盛顿５月２６日电  美国总统布什今天上午乘专机离开华盛顿开始为期一周的欧洲之行。这是布什总统就职以来第一次出访欧洲。
    根据计划，布什将于５月２８日至３０日参加北约国家首脑会议，同时对意大利、比利时、西德、英国等国作简短访问。访问期间，布什将同盟国磋商东西方关系和北约战略问题，以弥合美欧之间在短程核武器问题上的分歧。
    本报罗马５月２７日电  　记者罗晋标报道：美国总统布什昨晚抵罗马对意大利进行正式访问。今天布什总统会见了科西加总统，并同德米塔总理进行了会谈，就北约首脑会议等问题交换了意见。
    意大利是布什作为美国总统首访欧洲的第一站。布什抵意后强调意大利是“永远忠实的盟国”，此次访问表明美国对意大利的“尊重和高度评价”。
    此间报刊认为，布什的欧洲之行，不仅要改变其“过分的观望主义形象”，还可以看看大西洋联盟内部“戈尔巴乔夫效应”的程度如何，并力求就短程核导弹问题在盟国中求得妥协。据《晚邮报》报道，在北约布鲁塞尔首脑会议上，布什可能在接受苏联有关裁减常规武器的积极建议的基础上，向盟国提出一项促进谈判的系统计划。布什要传给戈尔巴乔夫的信息可能涉及３点：一是单方面裁减美国驻欧部队（据随布什访欧的美国记者传，要裁减１０％，即３．４万人）；二是把飞机有限地列入维也纳谈判；三是明确要求苏联抓紧时间谈判，在最近４年内达成协议。
    布什总统明天将去第二次世界大战期间美军登陆地奈图诺美军烈士墓参加纪念活动。
