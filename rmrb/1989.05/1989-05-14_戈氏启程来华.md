Gorbachev Departs for China

At the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun of the People's Republic of China, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Gorbachev, along with his wife, departed this morning on a special plane from here to China for a four-day official visit.

Accompanying Gorbachev on his visit are Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, CPSU Central Committee Politburo member responsible for international policy Alexander Yakovlev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Committee Maslyukov, and Minister of Health Chazov, who also departed from Moscow on the same plane.

This is the first time in 30 years that a top Soviet leader has visited China. The leaders of China and the Soviet Union will discuss issues related to the normalization of relations between the two countries as well as international issues of common concern. This high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union will have a positive impact on further improving relations between the two countries and on peace in the Asia-Pacific region and the world.

Those who went to Vnukovo-2 Airport to see them off included Chairman of the Council of Ministers Ryzhkov, CPSU Central Committee Politburo member Medvedev, and First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Lyukyanov, among other Soviet leaders.

Chargé d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the Soviet Union, Zhang Zhen, also went to the airport to see them off.
