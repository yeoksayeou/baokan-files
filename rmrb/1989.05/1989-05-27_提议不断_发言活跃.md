On May 25, as soon as the opening speech by Chairman Orlov of the Election Commission ended, a representative from Riga suddenly took the stage and requested a moment of silence for those who died in the Tbilisi conflict on April 9. In the afternoon, a scene unfolded where representatives from Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other. On the morning of May 26, as soon as Gorbachev announced the agenda, sociologist Zaslavskaya took the stage to speak, expressing her dissatisfaction with the police dispersing the crowd's gathering the previous night. She proposed that during the session of the Congress, the regulations of the Moscow City Government regarding parades and gatherings should be suspended.

Her proposal sparked nearly an hour of debate. In the end, the facts were clarified. Although the motion was not passed, the Moscow City Government still decided that during the People's Congress, the public could hold gatherings and meet with representatives at the Luzhniki field.

During the discussion of candidates for the Supreme Soviet, Lithuanian representatives declared that due to their lack of knowledge about candidates from other constituencies, they would only vote for candidates from their own republic, otherwise, they would refuse to participate in the election. After Gorbachev's repeated mediation, the Lithuanians finally withdrew their ultimatum.

    提议不断　发言活跃
    ２５日，选举委员会主席奥尔洛夫的开幕词刚说完，里加一名代表突然登上主席台，要求为４月９日在第比利斯冲突中遇难的人默哀。下午又出现了阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚代表互相指责的场面。２６日上午会议上，戈尔巴乔夫刚宣布议题，社会学家扎斯拉夫斯卡娅就上台发言，对昨夜民警驱散群众集会表示不满，提议大会期间暂停执行莫斯科市政府关于游行集会的规定。
    她的这一炮引起近一小时的辩论。最后澄清了事实。这项提案虽未被通过，但莫斯科市政府仍决定，在人代会期间，群众可在卢日尼基空地举行集会，会见代表。
    立陶宛代表在讨论最高苏维埃代表候选人时声明，由于对别的选区提名的候选人不了解，只投本共和国候选人的票，否则拒绝参加选举。经戈尔巴乔夫多方斡旋，终于使立陶宛人收回最后通牒。
