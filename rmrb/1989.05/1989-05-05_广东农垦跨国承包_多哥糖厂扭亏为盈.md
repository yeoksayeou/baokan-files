Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation Overseas Contracting Turns Around Togo Sugar Factory

The Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Reclamation Bureau and the Western Guangdong Agricultural Reclamation Bureau have taken on the overseas contracting and management of the sugar factory in the Republic of Togo. In just over a year, they have turned around this factory, which had been operating at a loss since its establishment and was on the brink of closure, achieving a profit. In the 1988-1989 crushing season, the factory produced 5,223 tons of sugar, completing 116% of the contracted plan, a 21.8% increase over the previous season, and generating an additional income of 1.7 million yuan. At the same time, production costs have significantly decreased, and the factory has set new historical highs in cane crushing volume, sugar yield, sugar production, product qualification rate, and output value.

Contracting and managing the Togo sugar factory is China's first overseas lease and contract management pilot project.

　　广东农垦跨国承包    
    多哥糖厂扭亏为盈
    本报讯  广东省农垦总局和粤西农垦局跨国承包经营多哥共和国多哥糖厂，一年多时间，便使这家投产以来年年亏损、濒临“灭火”的糖厂实现扭亏为盈。１９８８—１９８９年度榨季产糖５２２３吨，完成承包计划的１１６％，比上榨季增长２１．８％，增收１７０万元，同时生产成本大幅度下降，榨蔗量、产糖率、蔗糖产量、产品合格率、产值等均创历史最高纪录。
    承包经营多哥糖厂，是我国首次在国外进行租赁承包经营的试点项目。
