Standing Tall: A Chronicle of the Anti-Corruption Efforts of the Price Bureau of Shenhe District, Shenyang

First, let's hear what people say in private.

The Price Bureau of Shenhe District, Shenyang, has over 30 staff members responsible for supervising and managing the prices of more than 10,000 state-owned, collective, and individual businesses and commercial households in the district. They hold partial pricing authority for non-commodity fees and the power to penalize price violations. They are constantly moving between enterprises and the streets, navigating between power and money. Can they truly resist the temptations of eating, taking, obstructing, and demanding?

"Their meals are not covered by our store's meal tickets. We have never managed the Price Bureau's meals," said a price inspector from the Second Department Store of Shenyang. "Calendars are not a big deal. Before the New Year, we wanted to give them a few, but they refused to take them."

In a small collective hardware and electrical supplies store with only 25 square meters of business space, the manager told the reporter, "The Price Bureau staff often come, but they leave as soon as they finish their business. They don't even let us offer them a meal."

Among the interviewees, some might be afraid to offend the Price Bureau. However, from these examples, one can still see some genuine situations.

"People may know" to restrain "I dare not do"

Gifts are often disguised as bribes, and various "hand grenades" (fine wines), "twenty shots" (fine cigarettes), along with money, jewelry, food, clothing, and other items, are mixed together. In recent years, this 30-plus-person team has been "bombarded" with such offerings several hundred times each year.

Last May, the Price Bureau of Shenhe District concentrated its efforts on inspecting taxi fares. In three days, they dealt with 147 individual taxi drivers who were overcharging. Some drivers tried to bribe the inspectors with money and cigarettes to avoid punishment, but none of the 12 inspectors were swayed. One individual taxi driver asked, "We give you things, and there's no record. What are you afraid of?"

What are they afraid of? There is an old Chinese saying, "If you want no one to know, you must not do it yourself." If a way can be found to make "no one knows" become "people may know," it can more effectively ensure that "I dare not do it."

After continuous exploration, the Price Bureau of Shenhe District established a series of comprehensive supervision and evaluation methods for anti-corruption:

Twice a year, they send out letters to the inspected units with specific supervision content, seeking feedback. They regularly hold democratic life evaluation meetings, set up "Anti-Corruption Records," and strictly implement internal supervision. They set up a hotline for reporting, seeking social supervision. Each department, each team, and each individual has a "Work Record Book" to strengthen self-discipline.

The reporter randomly flipped through the "Work Record Book" of a colleague from the Market Department for last year. It clearly records what was done on which day and at what time. Each day is recorded, and a summary is made every week. In black and white, who would want to record a blemish?

Small issues sometimes need to be treated as big ones

In the Price Bureau of Shenhe District, an "Alarm Meeting" is held every month. Whenever a new wave of improper practices sweeps through society, they ring the alarm; if there are no problems within, they still ring the alarm; if there are problems, they ring the alarm even more, exposing the "stinky fish" on the table.

Last autumn, a colleague moved and borrowed a car from an enterprise. After the bureau learned of the situation, a public meeting was held where he made a public apology, and he also went to the enterprise to apologize.

Some people think that such small matters are not a big deal and that this is making a mountain out of a molehill. The overall environment has not completely improved, and the practice of giving and receiving gifts is still prevalent. A few good units cannot do much.

However, in the Price Bureau of Shenhe District, where righteousness has already overwhelmed evil, issues like accepting invitations, receiving calendars, and borrowing cars from inspected units have become "big deals." The leaders say, "If small matters are ignored, it may lead to the spread of corruption. Whether or not anti-corruption is effective cannot be measured by quantity, nor can it be judged by how many regulations are hanging on the wall. The key is whether you strictly follow the regulations."

The organizational life of party members has been strengthened according to the requirements of anti-corruption. Over 20 party members are divided into 5 small groups by department, with a life meeting held every two weeks to set responsibility targets. Every quarter, the masses are invited to evaluate the leading cadre and party members separately, emphasizing the supervision of the masses over party members and subordinates over superiors.

Who to turn to when facing difficulties?

When managing a household, everyone will encounter difficulties. Who to turn to? The leaders say that if the organization does not step in to help, it may lead to the use of power for personal gain.

Those without a place to live, the organization helps to find a house; those with family members who are unemployed, the leaders help to find a job; children having difficulty enrolling in school, the organization still helps to contact schools... In the past two years, the bureau has helped more than 10 cadres solve various practical difficulties in their lives. In the Price Bureau of Shenhe District, it has become a good practice to turn to the organization for help when facing difficulties, rather than privately engaging in personal "small actions."

Some people are concerned that in a society where various improper practices are rampant, the anti-corruption regulations of the Price Bureau are so strict, will it affect the enthusiasm of the cadres?

The fact is the opposite. Integrity and honesty make the people here stand tall, and they all have a sense of self-respect, self-love, and pride. Their work enthusiasm is even higher. Last year, the bureau handled a total of 836 cases of price violations, including 41 cases involving more than 10,000 yuan. The amount of fines and confiscations remitted to the treasury was over 1.65 million yuan. The workload was large, and the completion situation was good, ranking first among the 11 districts and counties in the city.

　　脊梁挺得直直的   
    ——沈阳市沈河区物价局廉政建设纪实
    先听听人们私下怎么说
    沈阳市沈河区物价局有３０多人，担负全区１万多个国营、集体企业和个体工商户的物价监督管理工作，手中握有部分非商品收费定价权和违价处罚权。成天转悠在企业和大街小巷，转悠在权与钱之间，他们真能做到不吃、不拿、不卡、不要吗？
    “不信，你查查商店的客饭单。我们从来没管过区物价局的饭。”沈阳市第二百货商店的物价员对来访的记者说，“按说，挂历不算什么。元旦前想送他们几本，可人家说什么也不要。”
    在一家营业面积只有２５平方米的集体五金交电商店，经理告诉记者：“区物价局的人倒是常来，可他们办完事就走。吃饭的事，连让都没法让。”
    被访者中，有人可能是怕得罪物价局。但从这几个事例，还是可以看出一些真实情况的。
    　　　　“人可知”制约“己莫为”
    名曰送礼，实为行贿，各种“手榴弹”（名酒）、“二十响”（名烟），和金钱、首饰、吃的、穿的、用的混在一起，近几年每年都向这支３０多人的队伍“轰”上几百次。
    去年５月，沈河区物价局集中力量检查出租车收费情况，３天时间查处了１４７个漫天要价的个体出租车主，有的车主企图用甩钱、递烟逃避处罚，１２名检查人员无一为其所动。有的个体车主不解地问：“我们给东西，无帐可查，你们怕什么？”
    怕什么？中国有句老话，叫“要想人不知，除非己莫为”。如果能找到办法使“人不知”成为“人可知”，就可更有效地保证“己莫为”了。
    经过不断摸索，沈河区物价局建立了一系列廉政建设综合监督考核办法：
    一年向被检查单位发送两次标有具体监督内容的《征求意见函》，争取反馈监督。定期召开民主生活评议会，设立《廉政记录簿》，严格内部监督。设立举报电话，争取社会监督。每个科室、每组、每人，都有一册《工作记事》，强化自我约束。
    记者随意翻看了市场科一位同志去年的《工作记事》，哪天，什么时间，干什么了，一目了然。每天一记，每周一小结。白纸黑字，谁愿意记下个污点呢。
    　　　小题有时要大作
    在沈河区物价局，每个月要开一次“警钟会”。社会上每刮一阵新的不正之风，要敲，自己不出问题，也要敲；出了问题，更要敲，抓出“腥鱼”放到桌面上。
    去年秋天，有个同志搬家，向一个企业借汽车。局里了解情况后，开大会让他作公开检查，并到那家企业赔礼道歉。
    有人认为，这类小事不算什么，有些小题大作了。大环境没彻底好转，请客送礼之风还盛，几个单位好，能管什么用。
    可是，在正气已经压倒邪气的沈河区物价局，像吃请、收挂历、借被检查单位车用这类事，已是“大事”了。局领导说：“对一些小事睁一眼闭一眼，就可能导致腐败现象泛滥。看廉政与否，是不能以量来划分的，更不能看你墙上挂着多少制度，主要看你是不是严格按制度去办。”
    党员的组织生活制度按照廉政的要求加强了。２０多名党员，按科室分成５个党小组，每两周一次生活会，制定责任目标。每个季度，请群众分别对领导班子和党员评议一次，强调群众对党员、下级对上级的监督。
    　　　　有了难处找谁解决？
    居家过日子，谁都会遇到难处。找谁解决？局领导说，如果组织不出面帮助，就可能产生利用职权为个人谋私的事。
    没有住处的，组织帮助找房子；家里有人没工作的，领导出面给找工作；子女入学难的，还是组织帮着联系学校……两年里，局里先后帮助１０多名干部解决了各种实际生活困难。在沈河区物价局，已形成有困难找组织，不私下搞个人“小动作”的良好风气。
    有人担心，在社会各种不正之风滥刮的情况下，物价局的廉政制度这么严，会不会影响干部的工作积极性？
    事实正相反。清正廉洁，使得这里的人脊梁挺得直直的，他们都有一种自尊、自爱、自豪之感，工作热情更高了。去年，全局共查处各类价格违法案件８３６起，其中万元以上的案件４１起，罚没款入库金额１６５万多元，工作量之大，完成情况之好，居全市１１个县区之首。
