	Like men addicted to smoking who blow smoke rings, some women and children in Wuhan have taken to chewing imported chewing gum, blowing bubbles with their mouths.

	In some large department stores, chewing gum has become a "mainstay item." A primary school teacher said that in her class of 45 students, at least 70% of them carry chewing gum with them every day.

	It is reported that Wuhan currently has five or six chewing gum production factories, but most of the chewing gum sold in the market are imports from Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, and other places.

　　洋口香糖充斥武汉
    新华社武汉５月１２日电（记者熊金超）就像烟瘾十足的男人吸洋烟吐烟圈圈一样，武汉的一些妇女和儿童都嚼起了进口的口香糖，嘴里吹起了洋泡泡。
    在一些大商店，口香糖已成了“主体货”。一位小学老师说，她们班４５人至少有７０％的学生每天随身带有口香糖。
    据悉，目前武汉已发展起五六家口香糖生产厂，但市场上出售的大多是泰国、南朝鲜、香港等地的舶来品。
