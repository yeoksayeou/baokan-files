In recent years, whenever Sichuan farmers encounter happy or sad events, such as weddings, funerals, or building houses, the hosts must prepare banquets, and guests must give gifts. Moreover, the amount spent is increasing, affecting the normal lives of farmers and restricting their investment in production. According to a survey of 5,500 households in our brigade, last year farmers spent an average of over 20 yuan on cash gifts to relatives and friends, which is equivalent to 45% of their household agricultural investment. If this standard is applied to the entire province, the amount spent by rural households on gifts would reach over 18 billion yuan. We urge relevant departments to take measures, strengthen propaganda and education, and guide farmers to invest their limited funds into production.

    四川农村请客送礼浪费严重
    近几年，四川农民每遇红白喜事、修房造屋等，主人要设宴，客人必送礼，而且所耗金额越来越大，影响了农民的正常生活，制约了农民对生产的投入。据我队对五千五百户农民的抽样调查，去年农民仅赠送亲友的现金支出人均达二十多元，相当于家庭农业投资百分之四十五。按此标准推算，全省农户用于送礼的开支就达十八亿多元。呼吁有关部门采取措施，加强宣传教育工作，引导农民把有限的资金投入到生产中去。
