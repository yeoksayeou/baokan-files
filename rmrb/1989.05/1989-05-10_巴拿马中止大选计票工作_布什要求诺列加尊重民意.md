Panama Halts Election Vote Counting; Bush Demands Noriega Respects Public Will

	According to reports, the city of Panama remains tense today. The National Electoral Commission of Panama announced this morning that it has suspended the vote counting. The date for resuming the vote counting and announcing the election results is unknown. The building of the National Electoral Commission is now surrounded by the military. The residence of the opposition leader is also under police siege. There are rumors that the opposition candidate Endara may be arrested.

	Meanwhile, U.S. President Bush has received a report from a U.S. congressional delegation regarding the Panama elections. He condemned Panama's President Noriega for election fraud and demanded that Noriega respect the election results and step down. He said, "The opposition has clearly and overwhelmingly won." White House spokesman Fitzwater stated that the United States is studying further measures against the Panamanian government, including military and economic actions, as well as suspending the implementation of the Carter-Torrijos Canal Treaties. Former U.S. President Carter, while condemning Noriega for election fraud, called on the international community to exert political and diplomatic pressure on Panama.

	Additionally, many Latin American countries have expressed concern over the tense political situation in Panama following the elections. Venezuela has requested that the Contadora Group countries convene an emergency meeting to discuss the situation in Panama. Diplomats say that if it is proven that the Panamanian government engaged in fraud, it could lead to the revocation of Panama's membership in the Contadora Group.

　　巴拿马中止大选计票工作  布什要求诺列加尊重民意
    本报墨西哥城５月９日电  记者郭伟成报道：据报道，巴拿马城今日继续保持紧张状态。巴拿马全国计票委员会已于今日晨宣布中止计票工作。何日恢复计票及公布选举结果尚不得而知。全国计票委员会大楼已处于军队的包围之中。反对派领导人驻地也被军警包围。有传言说，反对党候选人恩达拉可能会被逮捕。
    另据报道，美国总统布什已接到美国国会视察团关于巴拿马大选的报告。他谴责巴拿马总统诺列加舞弊，要求诺列加尊重大选结果，并自行下野。他说，“反对派已取得明显的、压倒多数的胜利”。白宫发言人菲茨沃特说，美国正研究对付巴拿马当局的进一步措施，包括使用军事和经济手段以及停止履行《卡特—托里霍斯运河新条约》等。美国前总统卡特在指责诺列加舞弊的同时，要求国际社会对巴拿马施加政治和外交压力。
    此外，拉美许多国家也对巴拿马大选后的紧张政治气氛表示忧虑。委内瑞拉已要求孔塔多拉集团国家召开紧急会议，磋商巴拿马局势。外交人士说，如果确实证明巴拿马政府舞弊的话，可能导致取消巴拿马的孔团成员国资格。
