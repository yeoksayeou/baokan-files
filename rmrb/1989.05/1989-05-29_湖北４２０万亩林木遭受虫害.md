New reports from Hubei Province's forestry department indicate that 28 counties (cities) in the province have recently experienced severe pest infestations affecting pine trees and poplar trees, specifically from pine caterpillars and poplar shoot borers. The affected area spans over 4.2 million acres, with 2.28 million acres severely damaged.

In the most affected areas, the pests have devoured entire forests, leaving the trees bare. From a distance, the forests appear as if they have been scorched by fire. The infestation is primarily concentrated in the hilly regions of eastern and northwestern Hubei. Local authorities have mobilized efforts to spray pesticides to control the pests. However, the infestation remains uncontrolled at present.
