This morning, the highest and largest hall in Yonghe Temple, Wanfo Hall, held its opening ceremony.

Wanfo Hall was built in the 15th year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign (1750). In May 1986, the state allocated 200,000 yuan for its restoration, which was completed this May. Inside the hall, a 26-meter-tall statue of Maitreya Buddha, carved from white sandalwood, is enshrined. This giant Buddha is one of the "Three Treasures" of Yonghe Temple. The statue was a gift from the 7th Dalai Lama to Emperor Qianlong.

　　雍和宫万福阁开光
    本报北京５月１２日讯  今早，雍和宫中最高大的庙宇万福阁举行了开光仪式。
    万福阁建于清乾隆１５年（１７５０年）。１９８６年５月，国家拨款２０万元予以重修，于今年５月完工。殿内供奉一尊高达２６米、用白檀香木雕成的迈达拉佛像，是雍和宫“三绝”之一。这座巨佛是七世达赖喇嘛贡送给乾隆皇帝的。（秦淑文）
