The external trade company of Zoucheng City, Shandong Province, has focused on developing the meat chicken industry, collaborating with 35 townships and 170,000 farmers to establish a complete meat chicken specialized production service system. Last year, the city's meat chicken exports accounted for 1/10 of the national total, and this year's first quarter saw exports exceeding 1,300 tons.

The company's meat chicken specialized production system consists of "four links": First, breeding high-quality strains. The company invested 26.5 million yuan to build two high-quality chicken farms, importing breeds and hatching equipment from the United States, Canada, and Australia, achieving an annual production capacity of 12.5 million chicks. Second, feed processing. The company imported two 5-ton pellet feed processing production lines from Thailand and built a 7,000-ton oil pressing workshop and raw material procurement and storage facilities, which are basically in line with meat chicken production. Third, specialized breeding. Various forms such as collective breeding, household contracting, joint household breeding, and professional large-scale breeding have been adopted, establishing 273 meat chicken breeding farms of different sizes, with a total breeding area of over 250,000 square meters. Fourth, cold storage and processing. The company built a chicken slaughtering workshop that meets international health standards, with a daily slaughtering capacity of 35,000 chickens, and built a 3,000-ton cold storage facility. The meat chicken processing and export varieties and specifications have reached 108, basically achieving deep processing.

In the process of establishing the meat chicken specialized production system, the external trade company treated farmers as "customers," actively providing services, and achieving "four to the door," namely, delivering chicks to the door, delivering feed to the door, providing disease prevention and technical guidance to the door, and purchasing mature chickens to the door; "two deferred sales," namely, the company defers the sale of chicks and feed to farmers, and settles accounts after selling the chickens. In addition, the company benefits farmers by ensuring that farmers' actual income per chicken is about 1 yuan in recent years. Since October last year, despite the sharp rise in feed prices and the drop in meat chicken export prices, the company still guarantees farmers a profit of 0.6 yuan per chicken, while the increased costs in processing and marketing are absorbed.

　　外贸组织上万农户　各项服务落到实处   
    诸城建成肉鸡专业生产体系    
    去年出口肉鸡占全国总出口一成　今年首季出口已逾千吨
    本报讯  记者贾建舟、宋学春报道：山东省诸城市外贸公司以发展肉鸡为重点，与３５个乡镇的１７万农户结合，建立起完整的肉食鸡专业化生产服务体系。去年肉鸡出口占全国的１／１０，今年一季度又出口１３００吨。
    这个公司建立的肉鸡专业化生产体系，主要由“四个环节”构成：一是良种繁育。公司投资２６５０多万元，先后建起２处良种鸡场，从美国、加拿大、澳大利亚引进良种和孵化设备，形成年产雏鸡１２５０万只的能力；二是饲料加工。公司从泰国引进２条时产５吨的颗粒饲料加工生产线，并建起与饲料生产相配套的年产７０００吨榨油车间和原料收购、储存设施，基本与肉鸡生产相配套；三是专场饲养。采取集体办场、分户承包、联户办场和专业大户办场等多种形式，共建起大中小不同规模的肉鸡饲养场２７３处，总饲养面积２５万多平方米；四是冷藏加工。公司建起符合国际卫生标准的宰鸡车间，日宰能力达到３．５万只，并配套建起３０００吨的冷库，肉鸡加工出口品种规格达到１０８个，基本实现精深加工。
    在建立肉鸡专业化生产体系过程中，外贸公司把农民当作“上帝”，积极为农民提供服务，做到“四到门”，即雏鸡送到门，饲料运到门，防疫和技术指导到门，成鸡收购到门；“两赊销”，即雏鸡、饲料由公司赊销给农民，售鸡后再统一结算。此外，公司还让利于农，近几年农民每养１只鸡实际收入平均达１元。去年１０月以来，饲料价格猛涨、肉鸡出口价格下跌，公司仍保证农民每只鸡获利０．６元，而大量的涨价因素在加工、运销等环节消化。
