In the past, ordinary people did not know what insurance was, but in recent years, they have gradually come to understand its role. Now, when someone loses a car, they just need to mention it to a colleague and hear words of comfort like, “Our unit has insurance for us!”

So, some people have come to rely too much on insurance. In the Fifth Institute of the Electronics Department, there is a person who has lost his car four times, each time receiving compensation. Some people think that since they have insurance, the insurance company should pay up if the car is lost.

In reality, insurance is not a "blanket cover." Why do some people lose their cars? Investigations have found that some people forget to lock their cars, and some even think that not locking the car is "carefree." This completely goes against the insurance clause that states, "The insured has the responsibility to strengthen the security of the insured property." For such situations, the insurance company has the right to refuse compensation. Insurance is not a "blanket cover." When the stolen car is found, when the insurance company notifies the insured to retrieve the vehicle, most people who have received compensation do not want to return the compensation to retrieve the car. Currently, in the Nanjing Public Security Bureau, there are more than four to five thousand cars waiting to be claimed. A worker from a certain pharmaceutical factory quickly received 90% of the original car price, totaling 268.2 yuan in compensation. In late March, the missing "Fenghuang" was found, but he claimed that he no longer wanted it.

### 保险并非“包险”

　　保险并非“包险”
    过去不知保险为何物的老百姓，近年来逐渐认识到了保险的作用。如今那些丢了车的人只要与同事提上一句，便会听见这样的安慰话：“单位给我们保险啦！”
    于是，有人躺在保险上了。电子部五十五所有一人，一连丢了四次车，每次都拿到赔款。有人认为，既然保了险，丢了车保险公司就得掏钱。
    其实，保险并非“包险”。一些人为什么丢车，调查时了解到，有的忘了锁，有的人甚至认为不锁车“洒脱”。这与保险条款规定的“被保险人有责任加强保险财产的安全防范工作”完全背离。对这种情况保险公司有权拒绝赔偿，保险并不是“包险”。被窃之车找回后，在保险公司通知被保险人领回车辆时，大多数拿过赔款的人，不愿意退出赔款领回车子。目前在南京市公安部门，待认领的车子有四五千辆之多。某制药厂一位工人，很快就拿到原车价百分之九十的赔款二百六十八点二元。三月下旬，失踪的“凤凰”被找回，但他却声称不要了。
