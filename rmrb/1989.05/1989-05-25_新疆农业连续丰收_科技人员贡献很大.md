Scientists from the Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences have played a crucial role in Xinjiang's agricultural success, achieving continuous harvests for 11 years. Currently, these scientists are actively working across the vast farmlands of the Tian Shan mountains, promoting and applying 55 new technological achievements over 560,000 acres of farmland. They are striving to secure the 12th consecutive year of bountiful harvests for Xinjiang.

Over the years, the Xinjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences has focused on serving rural areas through scientific research. From 1978 to 1988, the academy achieved 234 national, provincial, and institutional-level scientific research awards. Over 60% of these projects have been successfully applied to agricultural production.

The continuous agricultural harvests in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are a result of timely and extensive promotion of agricultural and technological achievements. In recent years, Xinjiang's agricultural technology promotion work has seen significant improvements and development. The work has transitioned from small-scale experiments in trial fields and stations to large-scale promotions. The focus of promotion has shifted from the northern region to the more challenging and economically underdeveloped southern region. Since 1985, science and technology development zones have been gradually established, focusing on Kashgar and Hotan in the south, Hami in the east, and Changji in the north. The academy's research achievements, such as the new rice varieties "Xin Dao 1" and "Xin Dao 2," new corn varieties "Xin Yu 1," "Xin Yu 2," and "Xin Yu 3," new spring wheat varieties "Xin Chun 2" and "Xin Chun 3," and new sugar beet variety "Xin Tian 2," have all been widely promoted, yielding significant increases in production.

The Kashgar region, predominantly inhabited by Uygurs, once faced grain shortages. In 1986, under the guidance of local party and government leaders, the Agricultural Science Academy collaborated with Kashgar's agricultural department to demonstrate and promote the "two early" high-yield cultivation techniques for early-maturing wheat and corn. By 1988, the promotion area reached 1 million acres, with yields increasing from 177 kilograms per acre in 1985 to 227 kilograms per acre. This achieved substantial social and economic benefits, effectively resolving the grain shortage issue.

　　新疆农业连续丰收
    科技人员贡献很大
    据新华社乌鲁木齐５月２５日电  （记者瓦哈甫·阿扎买提）为新疆农业连续１１年丰收立下了功劳的新疆农业科学院的科技人员，目前正活跃在天山南北广大农村，在５６０万亩农田上推广应用５５项技术新成果，为新疆夺取第１２个丰收年再作贡献。
    新疆农科院多年来面向农村，坚持科研为生产服务。从１９７８年至１９８８年的１１年当中，全院获国家级、省部级以及本院科研成果奖２３４项，其中６０％以上的项目都已推广应用到农业生产中去。
    新疆维吾尔族自治区农业连续丰收，是农业科技成果得到及时充分推广的结果。新疆的农业科技推广工作近几年来有很大的改进和发展。农业科技工作从试验场、站的小面积试验走向大面积的推广；推广重点从北疆向条件艰苦、经济落后的南疆转移。自１９８５年以来逐步建立了以喀什、和田为主的南疆科技开发区，以哈密为主的东疆开发区和以昌吉为主的北疆开发区。该院的科研成果，如，水稻新稻１号、２号，玉米新玉１号、２号、３号，春麦新春２号、３号，甜菜新甜２号等新品种，都已大面积推广，取得了良好的增产效益。维吾尔族聚居的喀什地区曾一度缺粮。１９８６年，农科院在当地党政领导下，配合喀什地区农业部门示范推广早熟小麦和早熟玉米的“两早”配套高产栽培技术。到１９８８年推广面积达１００万亩，单产由１９８５年的１７７公斤增加到２２７公斤。取得了较大的社会经济效益，摘掉了缺粮帽子。
