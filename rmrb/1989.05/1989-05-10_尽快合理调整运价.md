	To get out of its difficulties, the railway must promptly and reasonably adjust its freight rates, adhering to the following principles:

	First, base the determination of prices on costs. Fully consider the needs of railway safety and production organization, and the impact of price increases on railway transportation costs, to formulate freight rates.

	Second, follow economic laws. According to the economic operation mechanism of "state regulation of the market, market guidance of enterprises," use the economic means of raising railway freight rates to divert transportation within the effective range of water and road transport; for railway transportation that is busy and has tight capacity, implement a surcharge for expanding capacity to raise funds for improving transportation capacity.

	Third, have a strategic vision. Railway transportation is a basic infrastructure of the national economy and should have a certain degree of forward development. Therefore, when adjusting railway freight rates, it is necessary to ensure an appropriate cost-profit rate to have the financial resources for appropriate forward development. In addition, in tax policies, support should also be given to the development of railways.

	Fourth, handle the relationship between decentralization and centralization properly. According to the overall plan of the national price reform, following the principle of managing the prices of a small number of important commodities and services by the state and gradually liberalizing the prices of the vast majority of commodities and services, reform the management of railway freight rates. Major transportation prices such as passenger and freight should be managed by the state, while miscellaneous charges such as vehicle pick-up and delivery fees, vehicle disinfection and washing fees, and cargo receipt fees should be decentralized to the price departments of provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions for management.

　　尽快合理调整运价
    柳州铁路局局长  李蕴
    铁路要走出困境，必须合理调整运价，并遵循下列原则：
    一以成本为确定价格的基础。要充分考虑铁路安全和组织生产的需要，考虑物价上涨对铁路运输成本的影响，制定运价。
    二要遵循经济规律。按照“国家调节市场，市场引导企业”的经济运行机制，用提高铁路运价的经济手段对水运、公路等有效运程内的运输实行分流；对铁路运输繁忙、能力紧张的限制口运输，实行征收扩能费的办法，筹集改善运输能力的资金。
    三要有战略眼光。铁路运输是国民经济的基础设施，应具有一定的超前发展。因此，在调整铁路运价时，要保证适当的成本利润率，使之有适当超前发展的财力。此外，在税收政策上，也要对铁路发展给予扶持。
    四要处理好放权与集权的关系。根据国家物价改革的总体设想，按照少数重要商品和劳务价格由国家管理，绝大多数商品和劳务价格逐步放开的原则，改革铁路运价的管理。客货等主要运输价格由国家管理，而类似取送车费、车辆消毒洗刷费、货签费等杂项收费，应放权到省、市、自治区物价部门管理。
