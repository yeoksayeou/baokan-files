History has shifted, and the seasons have changed multiple times. The Yellow Crane Tower on Snake Hill in Wuchang has been destroyed by fire several times and rebuilt just as many. The most magnificent and grand, with the greatest expenditure, is the one standing today.

In ancient times, the Yellow Crane Tower was a gathering place for literary figures. In May, one would ascend the tower to see the short bamboo flute playing amidst the plum blossoms, with petals falling like snowflakes on lotus flowers; in September, one would lean on the railing to watch the long willows by the pavilions, with boats moored at the fish market on the riverbank. Writers had their own insights, expressing their feelings and aspirations, writing articles of concern, and lamenting the loss of their hometowns, which was quite common.

Today, those who ascend the tower during the peak season are as numerous as ants. However, there are very few who evoke a sense of nostalgia for the past here. People no longer need to trace the whereabouts of the crane from the Han Dynasty or the direction of the clouds from the Tang Dynasty. The tales of chickens, dogs, mulberry trees, and hemp have long been lost in the disco music echoing throughout the tower. Amidst the crowd of tourists, I have also stood several times in this high, imitation ancient building, overlooking the vast Milky Way, looking back and forth, singing and shouting.

A person's visual world is built on two experiences: the line of gravity is vertical, and the horizontal line intersects it at a right angle, forming a cross structure. Wuhan, the hub of nine provinces, is at the intersection of this cross. The Yangtze River flows from west to east for ten thousand miles, and the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway runs from north to south. These two major arteries converge at the Yangtze River Bridge in front of the Yellow Crane Tower, with vehicles and boats traveling in all directions. Walking along the high-level corridor of the Yellow Crane Tower, one can also let their hair fly freely and enjoy the scenery of the four directions.

Leaning on the railing and looking west, one sees a vast expanse. It is the Jianghan Plain where swallows fly and grass grows. This site of the ancient Cloud Dream Marsh still has thousands of lakes of green water. The pastoral songs and fishermen's songs blend into the watercolor fields, and a river flows horizontally. The Yangtze River, surging into Chu, begins to show greatness. Going upstream, upon entering Nanjin Pass, exploring the strange scenery of the Three Gorges for two hundred miles, and then going to Sichuan to get drunk, one can search for gods in the land of abundance before admiring the water conservancy hub of the Gezhouba Dam. The work of gods and ghosts, standing tall like an iron gate on the great river; governing the heavens and the earth, locking the floods of the high gorges. What a beautifully crafted landscape of intelligence. There are also giant hydroelectric generators rotating in the river, allowing you to feel the grandeur of the modernization process. Looking east from the railing, the Yangtze River, which has broken free from the thousand-fathom iron chain in front of Xise Mountain, weaves in and out of the misty rain between Wu and Chu, of course, with the twenty-four seasonal changes. If it is the season when the yellow flowers bloom and the crabs are fat, there will be more small and large boats on the alluvial plain of the Yangtze River Delta than there are fish crossing the river. The economic construction of the past decade is changing the golden dusty capital, the misty rain of the Six Dynasties in the south of the Yangtze River. Jinshan Temple no longer has the monk Fahai, and the distant bell of Hanshan Temple has filtered out the ancient sorrow. The people who buy boats to go away can enjoy the spring in the south of the Yangtze River, like lively fish in the spring river.

Standing on the Yellow Crane Tower and looking north, one's heart fills with a sense of chivalry. On the classical Central Plain, who is sharpening his sword on the left bank of the Yellow River? Who is singing on the cold waters of the Yi River? Since ancient times, Yan and Zhao have had many heroic and sorrowful singers. Their sense of crisis has become a sentiment passed down through generations of the Chinese nation. The chase for power in the Central Plain has caused many to age before their time, and many generations have weakened the national strength. This head of the power deer, absorbing the essence of the Central Plain for thousands of years, has leaped over one historical trap after another, shrouded in mist, and finally leaped onto the Tiananmen Rostrum, transforming into five golden stars, shining brightly in the brilliant star system of human civilization. Now, a new chase for power in the Central Plain has begun. However, what people are chasing is no longer the power deer, but the economic deer. This deer, once again, concentrates the confidence and strength of the entire nation, leaping on the new horizon of the Central Plain.

When I stand on the Yellow Crane Tower and gaze south, in an instant, my heart follows the roaring train, crossing the misty waves of Dongting Lake, passing through the steep mountains of Xiaoxiang, and joyfully rushing to the coconut and banana rains of Guangdong, feeling the great atmosphere of the new century. The south is full of mountains, mountains produce mist, mist produces mystery, and mystery produces wisdom. Wisdom is like the sea outside the southern mountains. In this sea, the Central Plain deer transforms into a leaping whale. In the great tide of the world economy, it is elegant and graceful, swimming with golden scales. The whirlwind cannot stop it. In one spring, it suddenly spits out fourteen pearls, stringing them into a radiant gold necklace on the ancient eastern coast—this is our nation's new pride.

Standing on the Yellow Crane Tower, the view is wide, and the heart is even wider. Opposite the tower, on the side of Turtle Mountain in Hanyang, is the ancient site of the Qin Terrace, where Yu Boya broke his zither to thank his friend. Turtle and Snake face each other, controlling the great river; one zither and one crane, responding to each other across the river. However, what I see before me is no longer the crane from the Han Dynasty. What I play in my heart is also not the zither from the Spring and Autumn period. In today's world, perhaps no one wants to be a celestial being riding a crane through the sky. Either be a hero chasing the deer on the Central Plain, or a brave knight riding a whale on the sea. Of course, there is another attitude towards life, which is to watch the shipwreck from the Yellow Crane Tower. But such people are indeed very few. As for me, although I cannot chase the deer or ride the whale, I am willing to be the friend of the brave, and I am fortunate to do so!

　　登黄鹤楼
    熊召政
    历史播迁，春秋数易。武昌蛇山上的黄鹤楼几次焚毁，又几次重建。耗资之巨，气势恢宏而趋鼎盛的，则是今天的这一座了。
    古时的黄鹤楼是文人骚客聚首之地。五月登楼，望短笛之梅，落瓣于芙蓉雪浪；九月凭栏，看长亭之柳，系舟在米市渔街。弄笔者对此，各有各的感悟，托兴寄情，写忧患文章者有之，叹乡关无觅者，更是不少。
    今天登楼的人，旺季时如蚁聚。然而在这里发思古幽情的，却没有几个人了。人们当然不必追寻汉朝的黄鹤翩然何处，唐代的白云又飘向哪里。鸡犬桑麻的往事，早已失落在满楼喧响的迪斯科舞曲中。夹在旅游的人群中，我也曾好几次置身这高拔的仿古建筑，临观苍茫河汉，回之望之，歌之啸之。
    人的视觉世界建立在两种经验之上：重力线是垂直的，水平线与它直角相交，成十字架结构。九省通衢的武汉，正在这十字架结构的交叉点上。万里长江自西而东，京广铁路自北向南，两条大动脉在黄鹤楼前的长江大桥交汇，车骑舟航，达至东西南北。而漫步黄鹤楼的高层回廊，亦能任乱发飘然，把四面江山，看个痛快。
    倚楼西望，苍茫一片。乃是莺飞草长的江汉平原。这云梦大泽的遗址，尚有碧水千湖。牧歌与渔歌揉成的水彩平畴上，更有一水横来。涌入楚地的长江，开始有了大气魄。溯江而上，在进入南津关，探奇二百里三峡，继而去巴蜀买醉，天府搜神之前，不妨先来欣赏葛洲坝的水利枢纽工程。鬼斧神工，耸大江铁门；经天纬地，锁高峡洪波。好一幅精美绝伦的智能风景画。更有旋转于江心的巨型水轮发电机，让你体会到现代化建设进程的宏伟。凭栏东眺，拍天而去的长江早已挣断了西塞山前的千寻铁锁。轮船穿梭在吴头楚尾，往返穿过迷蒙烟雨，当然也有二十四番花讯。如果在黄花初吐，紫蟹才肥的季节，长江三角洲的冲积平原上，大小游船就多于过江之鲫了。十年改革中的经济建设，正在改变金粉故都，烟雨六朝的江南情状。金山寺没有了法海，寒山寺远度的钟声，已滤净旷古的忧愁。买棹而去的游人，可在江浙的莺花月露中，乐成一尾春江上的活泼泼的游鱼。
    在黄鹤楼上引颈面北，胸中顿生侠气。在古典的中原大地，是谁在黄河的左岸磨剑？又是谁在萧萧的易水上放歌？古来燕赵多慷慨悲歌之士，他们的忧患意识凝为中华民族代代相传的情结。中原逐鹿，多少人逐老了青春，多少代又逐瘦了国脉。这一头政权之鹿，吸纳数千年的中原精气，跃过一个又一个漶漫着雾障的历史陷阱，最后终于纵身一跃而上天安门城楼，化为五颗金星，在人类文明的灿烂星系中闪射异彩。现在，一场新的中原逐鹿战又开始了。不过，人们逐的不再是政权之鹿，而是经济之鹿。这一只鹿，再一次凝聚全民族的信心和力量，跳跃在中原大地崭新的地平线上。
    当我站在黄鹤楼上遥望南方，俄顷中，一颗心已随着呼啸而去的火车，越洞庭烟波，过潇湘峻岭，载欣载奔，去到南粤的椰林蕉雨中，体会新世纪的大氛围。南国多山，山生雾，雾生神秘，神秘而生智慧。智慧则如南国山外的海。在这片海中，中原之鹿更化为拨浪长鲸。在世界经济的大潮中，它仪态万方，锦鳞游泳。飚风回溜，概莫能阻。在一个春天，它忽然一口气吐出十四颗明珠，在古老的东方海岸，串成了一条光芒四射的黄金项链——这是我们民族新的自豪。
    置身黄鹤楼头，眼界宽，心界更宽。与楼相对的汉阳的龟山之侧，是俞伯牙碎琴谢知音的古琴台遗址。龟蛇对峙，控扼大江；一琴一鹤，隔江呼应。然而我眼前翩跹的，不再是那一只汉朝的黄鹤。我心中弹奏的，也绝非春秋时代的那一张古琴。在今天，恐怕没有人愿意当跨鹤巡天的仙人了。要么做中原大地的逐鹿英雄，要么当大海上的骑鲸勇士。当然还有一种人生态度，那就是在这黄鹤楼上看翻船。但这种人毕竟很少很少。至于我，虽不能逐鹿骑鲸，却甘当勇士们的知音，自觉幸甚！
