	The Soviet Union will begin actual reductions in the number of troops and equipment in the Far East in the near future, according to Lieutenant General Lisov of the Soviet General Staff.

	At a roundtable discussion on Sino-Soviet relations and Asian-Pacific security organized by the Soviet News Agency today, Lisov also discussed Gorbachev's recent announcement to reduce 16 warships in the Pacific Fleet. He said these warships include cruisers and missile-carrying submarines.

	He revealed that the number of landing forces in the Soviet Far East is small, mainly for the defense of undefended coastal areas and to assist infantry operations.

	Regarding the reform of the naval structure, he said this means the fleet will reduce its operational area and decrease military exercises.

　　苏远东地区裁军将开始
    新华社莫斯科５月２４日电  苏军总参谋部代表利索夫今天说，苏联在远东地区实际削减军队人数和装备将在近期开始。
    在今天由苏联新闻社组织的有关中苏关系和亚太安全的圆桌讨论会上，利索夫还谈到了戈尔巴乔夫前不久宣布要裁减太平洋舰队１６艘战舰的问题。他说，这些战舰包括巡洋舰和携带导弹的潜艇。
    他透露苏联在远东的登陆部队数量很小，主要是保卫不设防的沿海地带，协助步兵行动。
    谈到海军结构改革时，他说，这意味着舰队将缩小活动区域，并减少军事演习。
