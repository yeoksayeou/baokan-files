The FA Cup semi-final resumed today after a three-week hiatus following the Hillsborough tragedy. This afternoon, Liverpool defeated Nottingham Forest 3-1 to secure their place in the final.

Today's match at Manchester's Old Trafford was lively and bustling. Due to severe traffic congestion, many fans were unable to arrive on time, causing the game to be delayed by 15 minutes. Learning from the lessons of the Hillsborough tragedy, the number of police officers maintaining order significantly increased for this match. The gates of the stadium's barriers were left open, a measure believed to meet the psychological needs of the spectators and enhance their sense of security.

　　英足协杯半决赛重新开赛    
    利物浦队胜诺丁汉森林队
    本报伦敦５月７日电  记者陈特安报道：英国足协杯半决赛在希尔斯堡悲剧发生三周后重新开赛。今天下午利物浦队以３∶１的比分战胜了诺丁汉森林队，进入决赛。
    今天下午，曼彻斯特老特拉福德足球场热闹非凡，由于严重的交通阻塞，许多球迷们未能按时到场，比赛延迟１５分钟举行。鉴于上次希尔斯堡悲剧的教训，这次比赛时，维持秩序的警察明显增多，球场内栅栏的门都敞开着，据认为这符合观众的“心理要求”，增加了他们的安全感。
