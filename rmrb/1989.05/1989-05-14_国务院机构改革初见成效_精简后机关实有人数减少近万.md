Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 14th.

The reporter learned from the closing of the National Personnel Work Conference yesterday that since the implementation of the State Council's institutional reform plan four months ago, initial results have been achieved in four areas.

According to reports, these four areas are:

	—Government agencies have undergone significant changes in their functions. During the institutional reform, the overall allocation of functions in various departments of the State Council has undergone significant adjustments.
	—The long-standing problem of overlapping functions and mutual obstruction among some departments has been resolved. Preliminary statistics show that more than 40 areas of overlapping functions have been resolved.
	—In accordance with the requirements for changing functions, the institutions have been adjusted, and personnel have been streamlined. After the reform, the number of staff in the State Council is still 5,000 fewer than before, and the actual number of people has been reduced by nearly 10,000.
	—Explored the path of institutional reform and functional transformation, laying the foundation for establishing and implementing the civil service system.

A responsible person from the Ministry of Personnel pointed out that due to the limitations of various supporting conditions, this round of State Council institutional reform still has a certain transitional nature; the implementation of the reform plans of various departments still needs to be checked and accepted; the operation of new functions and new institutions is not yet perfect. The State Council's institutional reform needs to be further deepened this year.

　　国务院机构改革初见成效    
    精简后机关实有人数减少近万
    新华社南京５月１４日电（记者费强）记者从昨天闭幕的全国人事工作会议上了解到，国务院机构改革方案实施４个多月以来，已在４个方面取得初步成效。
    据介绍，这４个方面是：
    ——政府机关职能有了明显转变。在机构改革中，国务院各部门在职能的总体配置上做了较大的调整。
    ——一些部门职能交叉、相互扯皮的“老大难”问题得到了解决。据初步统计，目前已有４０多个方面职能交叉的问题得到了解决。
    ——根据转变职能的要求，调整了机构，精简了人员。改革后国务院的人员编制数仍比以前减少５０００人，实有人数减少近万人。
    ——探索了机构改革、转变职能的途径，为建立和推行公务员制度打下了基础。
    人事部负责人指出，由于受各方面配套条件的限制，这次国务院机构改革还带有一定的过渡性；对各部门改革方案的实施情况还要检查、验收；新职能、新机构运转还不完善。国务院机构改革今年还需要进一步深化。
