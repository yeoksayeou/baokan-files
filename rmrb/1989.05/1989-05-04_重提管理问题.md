	Revisiting Management Issues
	Wang Yuan

	How to better leverage the contract responsibility system, the experience of some well-managed enterprises, is to strengthen enterprise management through the contract responsibility system. Not all enterprises pay attention to and do well in this regard. Some enterprises' management issues, instead of being resolved, have become more severe. Currently, to strengthen management, we should focus on studying and solving the following key issues.

	In recent years, the enterprise bonus system has shown clear distortions, with bonuses increasingly taking on a supplementary nature and losing their intended function. This situation must be fundamentally changed. We need to separate the functions of wages and bonuses, implement the principle of high rewards and high penalties, and adopt the veto power system in terms of methods.

	Strengthening enterprise management is key to mobilizing people's enthusiasm. After the decade of turmoil, while we quickly restored the enterprise reward system during several rounds of wage adjustments for employees, this reward system has shown clear distortions in recent years due to various influences. In enterprises (and similarly in various institutions), performance indicators have become increasingly lax, and the number of reward items has increased. Some tasks that should be completed within the basic wage range now require bonuses to be completed. The result is that bonuses are increasingly taking on a supplementary nature, losing their function of rewarding diligence and punishing laziness.

	To change this situation, we must fundamentally improve the current enterprise wage and reward system. First, we need to separate the functions of wages and bonuses, and their recipients and scope should not be confused. Wages are compensation for standard labor in the enterprise, while bonuses are rewards for excess labor. Therefore, employees can only receive full wages when they complete the standard labor quota set by the enterprise for their position and comply with the enterprise's various management regulations; they can only receive bonuses after truly putting in excess labor. Second, we must firmly implement the principle of high rewards and high penalties, adjust the focus of rewards according to the enterprise's production and operation goals, widen the gap between various bonuses, and make the rewards have a clear value orientation. Third, correspondingly, in terms of reward methods, we can learn from the effective quality veto power system in total quality management, and use methods such as deducting corresponding wages and bonuses for uncompleted main performance indicators.

	Optimizing the labor combination involves both the relationship between people and the relationship between people and the machine system. It should start from the empirical investigation of the most basic human-machine or human-human work unit, and select laborers, labor groups, and labor organization methods with corresponding abilities. It is one-sided to simply regard optimizing the labor combination as downsizing.

	In the past two years, the optimization of labor combinations in many enterprises has achieved certain results. In fact, optimizing the labor combination involves both the combination of individuals within a labor group and the relationship between the entire labor group and the enterprise's production technology system. However, in the current enterprise labor combination optimization, too much emphasis has been placed on the combination of individual labor groups, while ignoring the mutual relationship between the entire labor group of the enterprise and the enterprise's production technology system. The optimization of labor combinations should start from the empirical investigation of the most basic human-machine or human-human work unit, and through the study of labor time, labor actions, labor environment, and the operation of the machine system, scientifically determine labor quotas, work standards, and work quality requirements, thereby selecting laborers, labor groups, and labor organization methods with corresponding abilities. Without scientific standards and methods, the optimization of labor combinations can only be carried out at a low level.

	At the same time, optimizing the labor combination is a continuous and improving process, and it is only relatively optimized. In optimizing the labor combination, we should incorporate the employment, allocation, training, motivation, and elimination of employees into the basic work of enterprise management as a continuous process, forming an optimization mechanism and a standardized management system. The view that simplistically regards optimizing the labor combination as downsizing is one-sided.

	In terms of employee education and training, in addition to further improving the existing education and training system, we should re-evaluate and especially emphasize the apprenticeship system. The apprenticeship system has irreplaceable functions that general training does not have and is an important means of improving employees' quality. We should establish a master craftsman qualification examination system, improve the status of master craftsmen, and form a layer of master craftsmen.

	In terms of employee education and training, in addition to further improving the existing education and training system, I believe that we should re-evaluate and especially emphasize the apprenticeship system in enterprises. In the 1950s and 1960s, the apprenticeship system widely practiced in Chinese enterprises played a significant role in improving the skills and professional ethics of new workers. In recent years, due to changes in the employee structure and production technology conditions, as well as the influence of the social environment, the strict work relationship and close emotional bond between masters and apprentices in enterprises in the past have become quite relaxed, and the phenomenon of masters not caring for apprentices and apprentices not respecting masters is quite common.

	The apprenticeship system originated in pre-industrial workshops but has continued to this day. The reason for this is that it has irreplaceable functions that general employee training does not have. In the master-apprentice relationship, in addition to the transmission of practical skills, more importantly, it influences work style, emotions, and ideological consciousness, which is of great significance in maintaining the enterprise's excellent traditions and forming the enterprise's image. The apprenticeship system is an important means for enterprises to improve employees' quality. Therefore, in enterprises, we should establish a master craftsman qualification examination system, formulate relatively strict and comprehensive qualification standards, and give those who obtain master craftsman qualifications higher honors and wage treatment, forming a layer of master craftsmen that people respect and aspire to.

	To implement strict management, we must focus on the basic management work of enterprises, and the most important thing is to establish and improve the various management systems of enterprises.

	In the current management systems of enterprises, there are many irrational and unscientific aspects. Establishing and improving the management systems of enterprises should place great importance on improving their scientific level. This work should be done by each enterprise, but more importantly, it should leverage the role of industry management departments. Industry management departments should organize various professional personnel to focus on a few model enterprises, form a set of basic and scientific management systems and methods, and promote them to other enterprises.

	In enterprises, we should use a strict penalty system to ensure the implementation of various management systems and absolutely should not adopt a lenient attitude towards any violations of labor discipline.

　　重提管理问题
    王元
    如何更好地发挥承包制的作用，一些搞得好的企业的经验，就是通过承包制切实加强企业的管理。对于这一点并不是所有的企业都很注意并且做得好的，有些企业管理落后的问题不但没有解决，反而比过去更趋严重了。当前加强管理，似应着重研究和解决以下一些主要问题。
    　　　　近年来，企业奖金制度出现了明显的扭曲，奖金越来越带有补贴的
    　　性质而失去了应有的作用，这种状况必须根本改变。要把工资和奖金的
    　　职能分开，贯彻高奖高惩的原则，在方法上采取否决权制度。
    加强企业管理，关键在于调动人的积极性。十年动乱之后，我们在几次普调职工工资的同时，迅速地恢复了企业的奖励制度，这对调动职工的积极性产生了重要作用。但在近几年，由于多种原因的影响，这一奖励制度已出现了明显的扭曲。在企业中（也同样包括各事业单位），指标考核越来越松，奖励名目也越设越多，一些在基本工资规定范围内本应完成的工作，现在也要靠奖金才能完成。其结果是，奖金越来越带有补贴的性质，失去了奖勤罚懒的作用。
    要改变这种状况，必须从根本上完善现行的企业工资奖励制度。首先，要把工资和奖金的职能分开，两者的发放对象与范围不应混淆。工资是对企业标准劳动者的报酬，而奖金则是对超额劳动者的报偿。因此，职工只有在完成企业对其岗位规定的标准劳动量，并遵守企业各项管理制度的情况下，才能获得足额的工资；也只有在真正付出超额劳动量之后，才能获得奖金。其次，应坚决贯彻高奖高惩的原则，根据企业生产经营目标的要求，调整奖励的重点，拉开各项奖金的级差，使奖励具有十分明确的价值导向。第三，与此相应，在奖励方法上可借鉴全面质量管理中行之有效的质量否决权制度，对未完成的主要考核指标采取扣发相应工资和相应奖金等方法。
    　　　　优化劳动组合既涉及人与人的关系，也涉及人与机器系统的关系，
    　　应从最基本的人——机或人——人工作单元的实证考察，选择具有相应
    　　能力的劳动者、劳动群体和劳动的组织方式。把优化劳动组合简单地看
    　　作是裁员减人的认识是片面的。
    近两年，在不少企业中实行的优化劳动组合取得了一定的成效。实际上，优化劳动组合既涉及到人与人之间的组合问题，也涉及到人与机器系统之间的关系问题。但在现在的企业优化劳动组合中，则过多地重视了单个劳动群体的组合问题，而忽视了企业全部劳动群体之间、以及他们与整个企业生产技术系统之间的相互关系。优化劳动组合应当从对最基本的人——机或人——人工作单元的实证考察出发，通过对劳动时间、劳动动作、劳动环境以及机器系统运行的研究，科学地确定劳动定额、工作规范和工作的质量要求，从而选择具有相应能力的劳动者、劳动群体和劳动的组织方式。如果缺乏科学的标准和方法，优化劳动组合就只能是低水平地进行。
    同时，优化劳动组合也是一个不断反复和提高的过程，它只有相对的优化。在优化劳动组合中，应把对职工的雇用、调配、培训、激励与淘汰作为一个不断运动的过程纳入到企业管理的基本工作中去，使它形成一种优化机制和规范化的管理制度。那种把优化劳动组合简单地看作是裁员减人的认识是片面的。
    　　　　在职工教育和培训方面，除进一步完善现行的教育和培训制度外，
    　　要重新认识和特别重视师徒制度。师徒制具有一般培训所不可替代的作
    　　用，是提高职工素质的一个重要手段。应建立师傅资格考核制度，提高
    　　师傅地位，形成一个师傅层。
    在职工教育和培训方面，除要进一步完善现行的教育与培训制度以外，我认为，应当重新认识和特别重视企业中的师徒制度。五六十年代，在我国企业中普遍实行的师徒制度，对提高新工人的技能和职业道德曾起过很大的作用。近几年来，由于职工结构和生产技术条件的变化，以及社会环境的影响，企业中过去那种师徒之间十分严格的工作关系和密切的感情联系已相当松懈，师不管徒、徒不尊师的现象比较普遍。
    师徒制最初产生于工业化前的作坊，但一直延续至今。之所以如此，就在于它具有一般职工培训所不可替代的作用。在师傅的传帮带中，除了实际技能的传授之外，更重要的是作风、情感和思想意识的影响，这对保持企业的优良传统和形成企业的风貌有非常重要的意义。师徒制是企业提高职工素质的一个重要手段。因此，在企业中，应建立师傅资格考核制度，制定较严格和全面的资格标准，并给予取得师傅资格的人以较高的名誉和工资待遇，形成一个值得人们尊敬和追求的师傅层。
    　　　　抓好企业的基础管理，健全企业的各项管理制度，提高其科学水平
    　　。这方面的工作，要注意发挥行业管理部门的作用。要严格管理，不能
    　　对违反劳动纪律的行为采取姑息的态度。
    要实行严格的管理，必须抓好企业的基础管理工作，其中最重要的是建立健全企业的各项管理制度。
    在企业现行的管理制度中，存在着许多不合理和不科学的地方。建立健全企业的管理制度，应把提高其科学水平放到十分重要的地位。这方面的工作要靠每一个企业，但更应当发挥行业管理部门的作用。行业管理部门应组织各类专业人员，集中抓住几个典型企业，形成一套基本的和科学的管理制度与方法，并使之推广到其它企业中去。
    在企业中，应当通过严格的惩罚制度来保证各项管理制度的贯彻，绝不能对任何违反劳动纪律的行为采取姑息态度。
