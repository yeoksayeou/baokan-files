New Poetry Should Strike the Heartstrings of the Era
The Capital's Poetry Circle Commemorates the May Fourth Movement

On the eve of the May Fourth Movement, the Poetry Magazine Society held a symposium in the capital to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and the New Poetry Revolution. Attendees discussed the arduous and tortuous development of new poetry, noting that the literary revolution was a signal of the May Fourth Movement's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle, and that new poetry was the vanguard of the literary revolution. This is the glory of poetry, worthy of being carried forward by future generations.

Attendees pointed out that new poetry should focus on the era, be close to reality, and poets should carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, caring about the fate of the nation. Li Ying believes that serious poets with a lofty mission and a sense of moral responsibility should still insist on facing reality and life, not detaching from the era and the people.

Many poets believe that a sense of crisis is a precious tradition of May Fourth new poetry. Zhou Dichan hopes that today's poetry can, as Lu Xun said, stir people's hearts and write about things that people care about. People's hearts have "what is yet to be spoken, and the poet speaks for them, then a pluck of the strings, and the heartstrings immediately respond."

The meeting was chaired by Zhang Zhimin, editor-in-chief of Poetry Magazine. Famous poets and poetry critics such as Zhang Kejia, Ai Qing, Feng Zhi, Tang Dacheng, Bian Zhilin, Zhu Ziqi, Yang Zimin, Lü Yuan, Niu Han, Tu An, Wu Taichang, and Liu Qiuqiu attended the meeting.

　　新诗应握拨时代心弦    
    首都诗界纪念“五·四”
    本报北京５月３日讯  “五·四”前夕，诗刊社举行了首都诗界纪念“五·四”运动和新诗革命七十周年座谈会。与会者畅谈了新诗艰难曲折的发展历程，认为文学革命是“五·四”运动反帝反封建斗争的信号，而新诗又是文学革命的前导，这是诗的光荣，值得后人发扬。
    与会者指出，新诗应关注时代，贴近现实，诗人要发扬“五·四”精神，关心国家命运。李瑛认为，严肃的真正富有崇高使命感和道德责任感的诗人，还是得坚持面向现实，面向人生，不脱离时代和人民。
    许多诗人认为忧患意识是“五·四”新诗的宝贵传统。邹荻帆希望现在的诗也能像鲁迅所说，能激动人心，而且写出人们关心的事情。人们心中“有而未能言，诗人为之语，则握拨一弹，心弦立应”。
    会议由诗刊社主编张志民主持。著名诗人、诗评家臧克家、艾青、冯至、唐达成、卞之琳、朱子奇、杨子敏、绿原、牛汉、屠岸、吴泰昌、刘谌秋等出席了会议。
