A Serious Incident of Cultural Relics Destruction Occurs at Mount Emei
"The Evening Bell of Holy Accumulation" Meets with Misfortune

The People's Daily reports: According to the China Culture Daily, the "Evening Bell of Holy Accumulation" at Mount Emei, which is ranked as one of the "Ten Major Scenic Spots" of Mount Emei, holds significant historical and cultural value as well as aesthetic appeal. Recently, some individuals have blatantly disregarded the national cultural relics protection law, causing severe damage to this cultural relic.

Since last year, the abbot of Baoguosi Temple, Chuanfa, and others have claimed that the location of the temple is shaped like a phoenix, and the "Evening Bell of Holy Accumulation" situated directly opposite the temple gate is suppressing the "phoenix's head," acting as a malevolent influence on the monks. On April 2, without notifying any cultural relics management department, they used cranes and cutting machinery to forcibly dismantle and cut the giant bell from its support structure, transporting it out of the bell pavilion. This resulted in the support structure breaking, the relief sculptures being destroyed, and parts of the inscriptions and dedications on the bell body being worn away. When relevant departments arrived to stop the damage, the perpetrators ignored them. It was not until April 5 that the Emeishan City People's Government ordered a halt to this destructive behavior, preventing the situation from worsening. However, this precious historical relic has been dragged out into the open, exposed to the elements.

Currently, the Cultural Bureau of Sichuan Province, Leshan City, and other relevant departments are closely monitoring and investigating this serious incident of cultural relics destruction.

　　峨眉山发生一起严重破坏文物事件    
    “圣积晚钟”惨遭厄运
    本报讯  据《中国文化报》报道：被列为峨眉山“十大胜景”之首的峨眉山“圣积晚钟”，具有很高的历史文物价值和观赏价值。最近，一些人竟无视国家文物保护法，对这一文物景观大举破坏，造成严重后果。
    去年以来，报国寺住持传法等却以该寺所在地形是一只凤凰，而坐落在山门正对面的“圣积晚钟”压了“凤头”，是僧侣的克星为由，于４月２日未向任何文物管理部门通报，使用起重、切割等机械野蛮施工，将巨钟强行从支架上拆卸、切割并托运出钟亭，造成支架断裂、浮雕被毁，钟身铭文、题记部分磨灭。当有关部门赶来制止时，肇事者仍置若罔闻。直至４月５日，峨眉山市人民政府强令制止这一破坏行径，事态才没有继续扩大。但这一珍贵历史文物已被拖运至野外，任凭风刮雨淋。
    目前，四川省文化厅、乐山市等有关部门正对此严重破坏文物事件密切关注，调查处理。
