The first national men's basketball club cup tournament has concluded. The Liaoning team has risen to the top with a clear advantage of seven consecutive victories, convincingly becoming the first champion of this event. The Qianwei team secured the second place.

Liaoning fans have always been proud of their hometown's achievements in football, but in recent years, the Liaoning men's basketball team has not been inferior to the football team in terms of domestic dominance. Tonight, the first national men's basketball club cup tournament concluded here in Yueyang. The Liaoning team, with a clear advantage of seven consecutive victories, convincingly became the first champion of this event. The Qianwei team secured the second place.

Approximately 5,000 spectators packed the Yueyang Sports Gymnasium, eager to witness the championship match between the Liaoning team and the Qianwei team. However, the Qianwei team, ranked 17th in the national league as a second-tier team, was no match for Liaoning. They tied with Liaoning 10-10 in the first five minutes, but the rest of the game became a mere formality. The Qianwei team struggled with passing and shooting, falling behind by over 30 points within a few minutes, ultimately losing 58-112. Spectators outside joked that a prize should be established for any team that can defeat the Liaoning team in future national competitions.

Another second-tier team, the Guangxi men's basketball team, seized a chance to score four consecutive free throws with just two seconds left in the game. Player number 8, Han Lijun, made all four shots, turning the seemingly inevitable loss for the Shenyang Military Region team into a 103-102 victory for Guangxi, securing the third place.

The reporter learned from the Chinese Basketball Association that the second national men's basketball club cup tournament is scheduled to be held next year after the Asian Games. The top eight teams from the national league's first-tier division will have the qualification to participate.

　　第一届全国男篮俱乐部杯赛结束
    辽宁队平步青云得冠军
    本报岳阳５月２０日电  记者汪大昭报道：辽宁球迷一向最得意自己的同乡在足球场上的成就，其实，这两年辽宁男篮在国内的优势绝不比足球队差。今晚在这里结束的第一届全国俱乐部杯男子篮球赛，辽宁队以七战全胜的明显优势，令人信服地成为此项赛事的第一支冠军队，前卫队获第二名。
    大约５０００名观众把岳阳市体育馆挤得水泻不通，争睹辽宁队与前卫队的争冠之战。但是，排在全国联赛第１７位的乙级队前卫队根本不是对手。他们在前５分钟与辽宁队打成１０平，此后的比赛便成了例行公事。前卫队传球和投篮都很难出手，不出十几分钟就输掉了３０多分，最后以５８∶１１２败下阵来。场外观战的行家们戏言，建议今后全国比赛设立一项奖金，颁给能打败辽宁队的球队。
    另一支乙级队广西男篮在比赛还剩两秒钟结束时喜得四次罚球良机，８号韩荔军弹无虚发，使听天由命的沈阳军区队眼看到手的赢球成了泡影，１０３∶１０２，广西队战胜沈阳军区队，夺走了第三名。
    记者从中国篮协了解到，第二届全国男篮俱乐部杯赛已定于明年亚运会结束后举行，当年全国联赛排在前八名的甲级队有资格参加。
