Banks Should Support Enterprises in Paying Taxes

Reporters recently discovered during an investigation in the three northeastern provinces that, in the current situation where the national finances are extremely tight, some enterprises are using a large amount of tax funds for operations and projects, while local banks turn a blind eye and even support and encourage this behavior.

A "profitable enterprise" has been delaying the payment of product tax, value-added tax, business tax, and other taxes for nearly two years, accumulating a total of over 600 million yuan in unpaid taxes. It is understood that the main reason for this enterprise's tax arrears is that, due to the lack of national macro-control, after the state-approved transformation project was launched, the loan funds could not be guaranteed, so they had to use the taxes that should have been paid to fill the "gap." The local bank also tacitly approved this.

Since the second half of last year, banks have been facing tight operating funds, and some banks have only considered departmental benefits, ignoring overall interests, violating the national principle of "one tax, two loans" for enterprise deductions, deducting loans first and taxes later, or only deducting loans and not taxes, and even helping enterprises delay tax payments. An unnamed municipal tax bureau director told reporters that since last year, the municipal enterprises have owed 320 million yuan in taxes, two-thirds of which are commercial taxes, a historical first. When I submitted a notice to the bank according to national tax collection regulations to deduct taxes and late payment fines from a company, it was rejected three times in a row, and finally, it was thrown out as "waste paper."

Some enterprises do not willingly owe taxes. The manager of a company accused by the tax authorities of owing 50 million yuan in taxes said, "It's not that I don't want to pay taxes, but the bank is unwilling to transfer our company's deposits to pay taxes. We have no choice but to bear the 'black hat' of owing taxes."

Some financial and tax department officials have called for action, stating that the current situation of enterprises owing taxes has exacerbated financial difficulties. Banks should support enterprises in paying taxes, act from the perspective of national overall interests, and no longer give the green light to enterprises for tax arrears.

### 银行应支持企业完税

　　银行应支持企业完税
    记者最近在东北三省采访时发现，在当前国家财政十分吃紧的情况下，一些企业占用大量税款搞经营、上项目，而当地银行却视而不见，甚至纵容支持。
    有个“盈利大户”近两年来月月拖欠产品税、增值税、营业税等税款，到目前已累计欠税６亿多元。据了解，这个企业欠税的主要原因，是由于国家宏观失控，被国家批准的改造项目上马后却保证不了贷款资金，只好“礼尚往来”，用应缴税款堵“缺口”。他们这样做，当地银行也默许了。
    去年下半年以来，银行营运资金紧张，一些银行便只考虑部门效益，不顾及全局利益，违背国家关于对企业扣款实行“一税二贷”的顺序原则，先扣贷，后扣税，或者只扣贷，不扣税，甚至帮助企业拖欠税款。一个不愿吐露姓名的市税务局长告诉记者，去年以来市里企业欠税３．２亿元，其中２／３是工商税，这是历史上从未有过的。当我按国家征管规定向银行递交对一家企业的扣税和罚滞纳金通知书时，连续三次遭到拒绝，最后竟被当作“废纸”扔了出来。
    有的企业欠税并非自愿。一个被税务部门指责为欠税５０００万元的公司经理说：“其实，不是我不想交税，而是银行不愿意把我们企业的存款划作税款上解。我们只好背欠税的‘黑锅’。”
    一些财政、税务部门的同志呼吁，目前企业欠税加剧了财政紧张。银行应当支持企业纳税，从国家全局利益出发，不再为企业欠税开“绿灯”。
