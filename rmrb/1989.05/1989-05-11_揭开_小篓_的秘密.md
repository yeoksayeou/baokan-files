The "little basket," in the Shandong Peninsula, has been a traditional gift-giving tool since ancient times. When visiting relatives or friends or seeking help from others, people always remember the dignity of giving a "little basket" and the benefits it brings back.

However, times have changed. The wealthy people of Ninghai County in Muping no longer use the old willow baskets filled with two pounds of peach pastries and a bottle of old white liquor for polite exchanges. Especially when seeking help, the gifts in the "little basket" have obviously been upgraded: coveted Maotai wine and rare sea cucumbers from the sea are all collected in the "basket." Facing all this, the outstanding Communist Party member and director of the Ninghai Public Security Bureau, Wang Zhenliang, remains vigilant and upright, unyieldingly exposing the secrets of one "little basket" after another.

Wang Zhenliang has been on the path of law enforcement for 24 years, and he has always kept in mind a local saying: "Those who eat from others' mouths have short tongues, and those who take from others' hands have soft hands."

Last May, a teacher from Muping No. 1 Middle School, Yu Qingfu, was over 40 years old and had been separated from his wife and children in the countryside for many years. According to policy regulations, he met the conditions for relocation. Influenced by the social custom of giving gifts to get things done, he prepared in advance the items for the "little basket," asking someone to buy Maotai wine, sea cucumbers, and high-grade dried shrimp, and carefully sent them to Wang Zhenliang's home. After he finished explaining the situation, Director Wang immediately agreed to let him go back and handle the procedures. Teacher Yu was overjoyed, seeming to understand the value of the "little basket" in front of him. As he was about to leave, unexpectedly, Wang Zhenliang returned the "little basket" to his hands and angrily said, "Please take your things back." A few days later, Teacher Yu smoothly completed the procedures and was left with a lingering fear, thinking that the "little basket" was too light in weight, so he bought some more high-end items to put in it, and went with his wife and children to express his thanks. Before they could enter the door, Wang Zhenliang blocked them and, pointing at the heavy "little basket," scolded, "As a people's teacher, you should set an example for others, and yet you also learned to do this?!" Before he could finish speaking, the two doors were firmly closed.

The "order to leave" seemed unfriendly, but Wang Zhenliang has always been so strict in his official duties. Before the Spring Festival this year, the town government distributed two pounds of large shrimp to each leader of various units as a token of appreciation. When the phone call came, he complained into the receiver, "Sorry, I don't want any if there are no bureau officers!" Even in the face of gifts that everyone receives, Wang Zhenliang is clear-cut. In a small town, there is a Chinese-American named Wang Zhendong from Dong Youfang Village. Every time he returns home to visit, the officers go to his home to handle the household registration procedures. Director Wang learned that the old man had skin disease and specially used a local prescription to make medicine to help him, making Mr. Wang very grateful. Last June, when he returned to visit, he specially brought a set of finely made toiletries from the United States for each officer, and sent them to the bureau in a "little basket." Wang Zhenliang repeatedly declined, but the old man insisted on not taking it back. Finally, he patiently said, "Our Chinese police don't do this." And explained many reasons, the old man nodded, raised his thumb, and praised him.

The "little basket" contains the affection and intentions of the people, but it also harbors the motive of tempting people to comply. Wang Zhenliang is most aware of this. It was in January this year when a group of hooligans snatched firecrackers at the New Year's market and were caught by the officers and taken back to the bureau. During the interrogation, Wang Zhenliang discovered that one of the people, Song Wenzheng, had been his neighbor for many years. His parents, knowing Wang Zhenliang's stubborn temperament, carried the "little basket" and went to his home, finding his wife, Yu Zhenzhi. Unexpectedly, they were turned away, and then discussed with Wang Zhenliang, "Uncle, please, don't handle Wenzheng's case, I'll strictly discipline him at home." Wang Zhenliang's face turned stern, and he said angrily, "That won't do, if you had disciplined him earlier, how would this have happened?" The other person heard this and said in disappointment, "Director Wang, please, as long as you don't detain him, we are willing to pay the fine." Wang Zhenliang gave no leeway to those who haggled, and he humorously said, "Although I don't understand business, the law has its own fixed star." According to the "Regulations on Public Security Administration Punishments," Wang Zhenliang made the decision to detain Song Wenzheng. From then on, he offended his formerly close neighbors.

A son of a bureau-level official in the county directly under the county government, influenced by obscene publications, publicly disregarded the law and harassed an innocent woman in broad daylight, and was taken to the bureau by the public security officers. This official, in order to exonerate his son, prepared high-end items such as Maotai, sea cucumbers, and imported cigarettes, put them in a "little basket" as a gift for entering the "palace." Wang Zhenliang saw this and flew into a rage, throwing the "little basket" aside and slamming his fist on the table, "As a state official, you should uphold the law, but you are pleading for the lawbreaker and giving gifts, this is not allowed by party discipline!"

In Ninghai, everyone admires Wang Zhenliang because he has shaped a contemporary "clean official" with his heart and body!

　　揭开“小篓”的秘密
    徐忠
    “小篓”，在胶东半岛是古来时兴的送礼工具，探亲访友或求人办事，人们总忘不了送“小篓”的体面和换回的效益。
    然而，今非昔比。富起来的牟平县宁海人，已不再用当年柳条小篓，装上两斤桃酥、一瓶老白干礼尚往来。特别是求人办事的小篓礼品，出现了显然的升级：令人垂涎的茅台和水中稀有的海参，尽收“篓”底。面对这一切，优秀共产党员、宁海公安分局局长王振良同志，为警清廉，一身正气，无情地揭开一个个“小篓”的秘密。
    王振良打２４年前踏上执法征途，心中就铸下当地人的一句诲人俚语：“吃人家的嘴短，拿人家的手软。”
    去年５月，牟平一中教师于庆福，已经年逾４０，同乡下的妻儿多年分居两地，按政策规定是符合迁居条件的。由于受社会上办事送礼风气的影响，他事先下本钱筹划“小篓”的东西，托人买回茅台酒、海参和高档海米，小心翼翼地送到王振良家里，待他把情况说完后，王局长当即答应让回去办理手续，于老师一听满心欢喜，似乎悟出了眼前那“小篓”的价值。临走时，不料想王振良又将“小篓”还回他的手里，并生气地说：“请你把东西拿回去。”几天之后，于老师将手续顺当地办妥，不禁心有余悸，以为“小篓”的份量太轻，就又买了些高档商品装了进去，同妻儿一起前去道谢，不待他们进门，王振良就迎面拦住，指着那沉甸甸的“小篓”大发脾气：“你作为人民教师要为人师表，咋也学会了搞这一套？！”话音未落，两扇大门就被死死地关住。
    “逐客令”似乎不近人情，王振良为官历来就是这么硬。今年春节前夕，镇政府为慰问各单位领导，分给每人二斤大虾，电话通知时，他对着话筒叫屈：“对不起，没有分局干警的我不要！”就是在人人有份的礼品面前，王振良也泾渭分明。小镇上东油坊村，有位美籍华侨名叫王振东，每次探亲回家，干警都上门为他办理户口申报手续，王局长得知老人患皮肤病，还特意用当地偏方配药，帮助医治，使王先生非常感激。去年６月他探亲归来时，特意给每位干警从美国捎回一套精制的洗漱用具，回家后用“小篓”送到分局，王振良再三推辞，可是老先生高低不想拿回去。最后，他耐心地说：“咱中国警察不兴这个。”并讲了许多道理，老人听了点点头，翘起拇指连声称赞。
    “小篓”，聚结着民间的情和意，也潜伏着诱人就范的动机，王振良最清楚其中底实。那是今年元月，一伙流氓在腊月大集哄抢鞭炮，被干警逮回分局。王局长在审理时发现，这伙人中的宋文正与自己多年相邻，其父母了解王局长的犟脾气，就拐弯抹角地提着“小篓”上门，找到他的老伴于珍枝，不料想吃了“闭门羹”，回头又同王振良商议：“他大叔，不看僧面看佛面，文正那事你抬抬手别处理，我回家一定严加管教。”王局长面孔一板来了气：“那不行，你若早管教哪会闹出事？”对方一听失望地说：“王局长俺求求你，只要不拘留，掏钱认罚，俺也愿意。”对讨价还价者，王振良从不给余地，他幽默地说：“我虽不懂生意经，可法律自有定盘星。”依据《治安处罚条例》，王振良将宋文正作出了拘留决定。从此后，他便得罪了以往情深的老邻居。
    县直机关一位局长的“公子”，受淫秽书刊的影响，光天化日之下无视法律，拦路侮辱一位无辜妇女，被公安干警押进分局。这位局长为了给儿子开脱罪责，便备下茅台、海参和进口香烟等高档东西，装进小篓，作为进“殿”之礼。王振良见状火冒三丈，将“小篓”甩到一边，拍案叫起：“身为国家干部，当该维护法律，可你竟替违法者说情送礼，这是党纪所不允的！”
    在宁海，人们无不佩服王振良，因为他用心身塑造了一个当代“清官”的形象！
