	Resignation Inevitable, Successor Unclear: Bamboo Underwood Cabinet in a Dilemma
	By Yu Qing, People's Daily Correspondent

	Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru announced on April 25 that he would step down after the budget for this year is passed in the House of Councillors on May 27. A month has passed, and the Liberal Democratic Party, which boasts of having a wealth of talent, has yet to select a successor for the party president.

	Takeshita's indication of his intention to resign is genuine. The reason is that the House of Councillors election is approaching, and the LDP wants to change the current situation where its reputation has been severely damaged by the stock scandal, and it is struggling to regain its momentum for the upcoming election. Changing leadership early is undoubtedly more advantageous than prolonging the agony, so Takeshita is unwilling to cling to power, but he cannot resign as he wishes, and can only reluctantly "overstay his term."

	Takeshita's inability to step down and the difficulty in selecting a new leader have sparked widespread discussion. Diplomats point out that with the upcoming G7 summit at the end of the month, the Western summit in July, and the impending U.S.-Japan economic friction, the delay in the handover of the old and new cabinets directly affects the formulation of policies and strategies. The difficulty in producing a new party president and prime minister also damages Japan's international image. Business tycoons express that long-term political instability is detrimental to economic stability and development. Recent devaluation of the yen, stock market fluctuations, and political instability are all influencing factors. The call for the LDP to make an early decision on the successor issue is growing stronger, making the Takeshita cabinet anxious.

	It is not that the LDP lacks talent. After Takeshita indicated his intention to resign, the idea of supporting Ito Masayoshi to succeed him was put on the agenda, but Ito firmly declined. Poor health is one of Ito's reasons, but the fundamental reason is the difference in political views, making it difficult for him to cooperate. Ito's conditions are: first, to promote young people; second, to abolish factions; and third, for all LDP members involved in the stock scandal to resign. Such a major overhaul is naturally unacceptable to the LDP's powerful figures. Ito sees that the powerful figures in the party lack the sincerity to reform, and it is only natural that he firmly declines.

	Although the new party president is temporarily difficult to produce, someone will eventually have to take over. Currently, the candidates being discussed can be divided into two types. One type is the "young" figures represented by the LDP's acting secretary-general. The other type is the "elderly" figures represented by Fukuda Takeo. For the former, there are those within the LDP and the business community who find them "too young," while they tend to favor the "elderly" figures who have no conflicts of interest with various factions within the party.

	Takeshita and Ito met at the Prime Minister's Official Residence today. In addition to reiterating his refusal to take office, Ito suggested that Takeshita take the lead in mediating the new party president. In order to resolve this political situation as soon as possible and to get himself out of the dilemma, Takeshita will change his previous approach of watching others run around and take personal action. Whether this will be successful remains to be seen.

### 退位势在必行　谁来接班难定  竹下内阁进退维谷

　　退位势在必行　谁来接班难定
    竹下内阁进退维谷
    本报记者  于青
    日本首相竹下登上月２５日宣布，本年度预算案５月２７日在参院通过以后，他就交权引退。时过一月，一向自诩“人才济济”的自民党竟还未推选出总裁继任人选。
    竹下示意准备引退并非虚情假意。究其原因是，参院选举日益临近，自民党想通过更新总裁，改变目前这种因股票丑闻威信扫地、一蹶不振的状况，重振旗鼓迎战参院竞选。尽早改头换面无疑比苟延残喘有利，竹下无心恋栈，但又不能如愿引退，只好硬着头皮“超期服役”。
    竹下退不下来，新人换不上去，引起议论纷纷。外交界人士指出，面临月末的经合组织会议，７月的西方国家首脑会谈，山雨欲来的日美经济摩擦，新旧内阁迟迟不能接交，直接影响制定方针对策。新总裁和新首相难产，也有损于日本的国际形象。财界大亨表示，政局长期动荡有碍经济稳定发展。最近日元贬值、股价波动、政局动荡就是影响因素之一。敦促自民党在后任总裁问题上早做决断的呼声愈益强烈，使竹下内阁心急如焚。
    其实，也不能说自民党内没有人才。竹下表示准备辞职后，拥立伊东正义接任就提到日程上来，无奈伊东坚辞不受。健康不佳固然是伊东的理由之一，但根本原因在于政见不同，难以为伍。伊东要求的条件是：一、启用年青人；二、取消派系；三、牵连股票丑闻的自民党议员全部辞职。这种伤筋动骨的大手术，自民党实力人物自然不愿接受。伊东看出党内实权人物没有痛改前非的诚意，理所当然坚辞不受。
    尽管新总裁一时难产，最终还要有人走马上任。眼下议论中的候选人可分为两类。一类是以自民党代理干事长为代表的“少壮型”人物。另一类是以福田赳夫为代表的“长老型”人物。对于前者，自民党内和财界都有人“嫌嫩”，而倾向于与党内各派无利害冲突的“长老型”人物。
    竹下和伊东今天在首相官邸会谈。伊东除再次表示拒绝出山外，建议竹下出面参加新总裁斡旋。为了使这一政局早日得出答案，也为了自己尽快摆脱进退维谷的境地，竹下将一改过去坐视他人奔走的做法，亲自出马，能否马到成功，尚难预料。
