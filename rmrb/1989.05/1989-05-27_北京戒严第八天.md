Beijing has passed its eighth day under martial law in a calm atmosphere. Yesterday, people standing on the streets appeared calm, and the order in the city was maintained. Martial law seems to have become less of a heated topic among the citizens.

The world's attention is focused on Tiananmen Square, where students are still sitting in protest under the scorching sun. The question of whether to continue the sit-in or withdraw and return to school has divided the students. The student command center has repeatedly sought the opinions of representatives from various universities on the square, and it is said that a vote will be held to decide the matter.

According to the Beijing Daily, while batches of out-of-town students are leaving Beijing, more out-of-town students are still pouring into the city. Their living conditions are currently facing significant difficulties. Fewer people are bringing them food compared to previous days.

At night, some major intersections in the city still have scattered groups of people, with discussions about the situation being their main topic.

　　北京戒严第八天
    本报北京５月２８日凌晨讯  北京又在平静的气氛中度过戒严后的第八天。
    昨日伫立街头，只见行人神色安详，市区秩序井然。戒严，似乎不再是市民们最激烈的话题了。
    世人瞩目的天安门广场，静坐请愿的学生在烈日下支撑。是继续静坐还是撤离回校，学生们意见不一。学生的指挥中心已就此问题反复征求广场上各高校代表的意见，据说将付诸投票表决。
    据北京日报昨天报道，在一批批外地学生离京的同时，一队队外地学生还在涌入北京，他们的生活目前遇到很大困难。为学生送饮食的人少于前些天。
    入夜，城区一些主要街口，仍有一些分散的人群，议论时局是他们的主要话题。
