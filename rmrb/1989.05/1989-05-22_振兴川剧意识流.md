		Revitalizing Sichuan Opera
		Wei Minglun

		Sichuan cuisine and Sichuan opera have always been equally famous. Why not revitalize Sichuan cuisine today, instead of focusing on revitalizing Sichuan opera?

		The Cultural Revolution ravaged the minds of the people, making it impossible to change the tastes of the common folk. Food and sex, with appetite taking precedence over desire. Sichuan cuisine is wonderful! Customers flock to every meal, and everyone praises it as delicious. There's no need for anyone to revitalize it.

		Sichuan opera is in danger! Whether it's the honest officials or corrupt officials, law-abiding citizens or lawbreakers, spiritually civilized people or spiritually polluted people of the 1980s, both sides are uniformly indifferent to Sichuan opera—few or none come to buy tickets to watch the shows. Our path is cold but not lonely; there are still several more desolate sibling opera genres in the country to keep us company. The foreign stage is also in decline; television is on the rise, and drama is in the cold palace, which is the latest global trend. Sichuan opera has not opened in Mars, so it must share the cold and heat with the world. Seeing the precious heritage decline at the end of the 20th century, what should we do? Should we let it die out naturally, or should we try to revitalize it? Not revitalizing it is too painful, but revitalizing it is a headache. It's far from as easy and beneficial as establishing a "Sichuan Cuisine Revitalization Leading Group." If you want to be angry, come and revitalize the theater; if you want to be really angry, come and revitalize Sichuan opera...

		The people of Sichuan, both high and low, who are determined to revitalize Sichuan opera, are not afraid of taking on big tasks. They have ignited the coldest stove in the country and are the first to raise the "revitalization" banner on the national stage. Perhaps influenced by the spirit of Zhuge Liang and Liao Hua at the Wuhou Temple, they are willing to take on the task at a time of defeat and carry out their mission in times of danger, attacking as a means of defense, knowing that it is impossible but doing it anyway... After nearly six years of revitalization, they have indeed achieved a series of results, but they have also stirred up a pile of complaints!

		Sichuan people are humorous. After "revitalization," they add an "er" sound, making it sound like "revitalizing decayed Sichuan opera"!

		The speaker is blameless, but the listener should be warned. Let's take the negative complaints and turn them into a positive sense of crisis. Below, there are complaints about decay, and above, we should scratch our heads and ask why? Was it because the initial flag-waving and cannon-firing were too spectacular? They didn't expect that there would be a "dual-track system"—the troupes scattered like birds and beasts! The small logic of revitalizing Sichuan opera is controlled by the big logic of revitalizing China! Whether you understand it or not, you have to execute it, and deepen your understanding while executing and being scolded. Previously, everyone thought that revitalizing Sichuan opera meant expanding and multiplying the troupe, with overly high expectations; now, revitalizing it in a small and precise way naturally leads to great disappointment. To what extent should it be revitalized to be prosperous and not decay? The nature is not clear, the standards are different, and everyone has their own stream of consciousness—

		One stream of consciousness is to flashback to ten years ago, when the model operas ruled the land. Learn from the model troupes, with a large orchestra, iron rice bowls, ten years to polish one play, and the play follows the loudspeaker to resonate in every corner. Everyone knows "The Red Lantern," and every family can sing "The White-Haired Girl." The plain stretches as far as the eye can see, and wherever there are people, there is "Zhao Yonggang"...

		Another stream of consciousness is to flashback to thirty years ago, during the golden age of Sichuan opera. The people of Tianfu, workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and merchants, are familiar with the roles of sheng, dan, jing, mo, and chou. A small city can accommodate two troupes, and a large factory often has several groups of enthusiasts. If you don't like the high-pitched voice, you are not a true Sichuan native; if you don't understand Sichuan opera, you are uncivilized. Even more fortunate is the favor of the Purple Light Pavilion, coming and going frequently, as easy as going to the market on the third, sixth, and ninth days of the month. The most prestigious is the Premier helping us revise the script; the Commander-in-Chief, Foreign Minister, Chief of Staff, Marshals, and Generals surrounding the hometown treasure, injecting nutrients. The importance and necessity of "Red Phoenix Robe, Soso Hill" seem to be close to hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs...

		Another stream of consciousness is to flashback to fifty years ago, when the Yuelai Tea Garden and the Youxin Theater divided Chengdu and Chongqing, and the two never interacted. Closing the door to rule, why bother to perform elsewhere? Good wine needs no bush, and guests only worry about not being able to squeeze into the hall. Upstairs, standing and listening all night just to satisfy the urge to watch a play. How is Confucius? How is Master Tian? The Sichuan opera king, Zhang Er, with a single performance, brings peace. Tang Sanqian, Song Baibai, countless Three Kingdoms. Occasionally, a "downriver" troupe comes to Sichuan to make a living, give them a couple of bowls of soup. The strong dragon cannot fight the local snake, and one old crow guards a sandbank. The Sichuan opera pier, who dares to challenge the dragon head captain...

		In short, if today it is not revitalized to the level of any of the above three streams of consciousness, then it is not prosperous, then it is decayed and ruined!

		Comrade, don't dream. The golden age has flown away, and you can't bring back the golden times!

		I have a stream of consciousness, less flashback, and look forward—today's audience, especially young audiences, are the most difficult "Gods" in history. This generation of little old people, their relationship with the arts has already ended the "one husband, one wife" system. They love novelty, are fickle, one moment they dislike plumpness, the next moment they dislike thinness, pushing away Yu Meiren with one hand and reaching out to foreign women with the other. If they really reach the Élysée Palace, pursue high-level makeup, travel the world of art, and enrich their aesthetic tastes, I think it's a good thing. Don't return home too early, returning home will break your heart. Who knows when the leaves will fall back to the roots, the green-clad person like a flower, still White Snake Lady, Yu Niangzi, Fourth Sister, and the Lotus Fairy are gentle. Ladies, don't wait, dress up in the latest fashion, is the eyebrow depth in fashion? Adaptation is for conquest, lower the tone again, adaptation is for survival. While adapting to God, guide God to adapt to us. As long as we can preserve a seat among the three thousand beauties and twelve golden pins, share a few nights of romance, the revival has begun.

		From this standard, Chengdu, Xindu, Fucheng, Yanzhou... all have pleasant gains; Tiancheng, Guocheng, Yucheng, Fucheng... small cities are not without small springs. Several times on the screen competition, several times in Beijing to win the championship, four plum blossoms, five gold medals, at least the literary script has won great honors on the national stage, the Sichuan army is not weak. Can we say that our Sichuan opera has become a blank sheet of paper? The results are piled up, the sun and moon are bright!

		Stream of consciousness soars—just as revitalization is in sight, an economic crisis triggers a cultural crisis. The higher-ups save financial resources and streamline troupes, while the lower levels unleash a wave of low-level cultural enjoyment!

		This wave has long swept through the West. Rich countries can afford to raise spoiled children without harming the overall situation. How can a poor and backward family support hundreds of millions of young masters and misses? Strange, two years ago, the enthusiasm for play was still offset by ambition, but why is the ambition now being drowned by the enthusiasm for play? Perhaps the young people and college students once paid close attention to national affairs with their pure hearts, but after being disappointed and trampled on, they could not withstand the wind and rain, lacking the toughness of middle-aged people, showing the fragility of young willows. National affairs, let them be, play mahjong. From caring about the world to sinking with the world, playing with the world, indifferent to the world. Everything must be added with the word "play," play philosophy, play religion, play the Buddha's navel, play the softness of Guanyin's chest. Ten steps without fragrant grass? Among the young generation, there are indeed outstanding talents, both in character and learning, who will one day soar like dragons and phoenixes. But there are also those who are too high, too mysterious, who look at art as something that is good if it is not understood, and anything that is understood is not worth looking at. Brothers and sisters pretend to be crazy, infecting younger siblings, a few little ones with a few flaws, a few ignorant, a few bored, and a few shameless! Not loving elegant high taste, but picking up low-grade culture with flashy packaging and straw inside. Commodities are soaring, but cultural quality is plummeting, and appreciation levels are slipping. Dancing and twisting like bed actions, singing with a voice that mimics sexual moans. Singers stepping down from the stage to touch the audience is the necessary path of performance, and the audience rushing onto the stage to bite the singer is the best state of art. The world's drama is richer and more colorful than the stage drama, officials "fall" quickly, children "collapse" quickly, a competition of collapse, you are more corrupt than I am! Eating, drinking, gambling, and fighting, no money to learn to pull razz, go steal, go rob, go kill people, go set fires! At worst, go in and sing prison songs, mix out and become a delayed strong man, mix out and become a hero who smiles on the execution ground, goodbye, twenty years later, come and play again...

		Aiyo, God! No matter how Sichuan opera adapts and reforms, it can't keep up with this trend! Contemporary excellent literature, foreign high art, all temporarily step aside. What is the Sichuan opera troupe? If the door is not cold, that would be strange!

		Those who are determined to revitalize it encounter such a climate, it's really hard. They have to reform the stagnation of Sichuan opera itself with all their might, and they cannot sell smiles and bodies to cater to the corruption of God. How to be modernized? Chew on bitter fruits and slowly digest them.

		Don't blame my stream of consciousness for running away. Just talking about the theater doesn't go deep, the effort is outside the theater. Standing high and observing broadly, revitalizing Sichuan opera is attached to the big background of revitalizing China, and there is no way to transcend the economic and cultural difficulties of society to fly alone. When will drama come out of the low valley? Ask when China will climb to the peak...

　　振兴川剧意识流
    魏明伦
    川菜川剧历来齐名，今朝何不振兴川菜，偏要振兴川剧？
    “文革”洗劫了国人的脑筋，没法改造百姓的胃口。饮食男女，食欲的座次排在性欲前头。川菜美哉！餐餐客源源不断，人们一律说它好吃。用不着谁去振兴。
    川剧危矣！八十年代的清官或贪官，守法户或违法户，精神文明者或精神污染者……很不统一的双方对于川剧则统一冷淡——少来或不来买票看戏。吾道冷而不孤，全国还有若干更为寂寞的弟兄剧种形影相吊。老外的舞台也不景气；电视发高烧，戏剧入冷宫，乃是世界性的最新行情。川剧没在火星上开锣，只得与环球共此凉热。眼看宝贵遗产衰败于２０世纪末叶，怎么办？是任其自生自灭，还是设法去振一振呢？不振太心疼，一振又头痛。远不及成立“振兴川菜领导小组”轻松而实惠。要生气，来振戏；要生大气，来振川剧……
    蜀中上下有志之士居然不怕生大气，烧起天下第一冷灶，率先在全国剧坛打出“振兴”旗号。大约是受了武侯祠内诸葛丞相、廖化先锋的影响，甘愿受任于败军之际，奉命于危难之间，以攻为守，知其不可为而为之……一振将近六个春秋，确实振出一串成果，同时振出一堆牢骚！
    四川人诙谐，只在“振兴”之后加一“儿”韵，念起来就成了“振朽儿川剧”！
    言者无罪，闻者足戒，请从消极的牢骚话里取其积极的忧患感。下面既有整朽之怨，上面应该搔首问个为什么？是否当初扯旗放炮过于轰烈？没料到上面要搞“双轨制”——剧团纷纷鸟兽散！振兴川剧的小道理被振兴中华的大道理管着！理不理解都得执行，于执行和挨骂中加深理解。先前大家以为振兴川剧是把队伍振大振多，期望过高；如今振小振精，自然大失所望。要振到什么地步才算兴而不朽？定性不清，标准不同，各有各的意识流——
    一种流向是闪回十年，当日之域中，样板戏之天下。向样板团学习，大乐队，钢饭碗，十年磨一戏，戏随高音喇叭响彻每个角落，百姓不可一日无此君。人人皆知《红灯记》，家家能唱《沙家浜》。平原一望，哪里有人民哪里就有“赵永刚”……
    另一种流向是闪回三十年，正值川剧黄金时代。天府工农兵学商，熟悉生旦净末丑。一隅小城可容两个剧团，一座大厂常有几批玩友。不爱高腔枉称四川老乡，不懂川剧便是不懂文明。更蒙紫光阁宠幸，常来常往，易如三六九赶场。最神气是国务院总理帮咱们改台词；总司令、外交部长、参谋总长、元帅大将围著家乡宝贝灌输营养品。“红鸾袄、梭梭岗”的重要性和必要性，似乎接近氢弹原子弹……
    再一种流向是闪回五十年，悦来大茶园与又新大戏院分占成渝，老死不相往来之时。闭关称雄，何须走穴？酒好不怕巷子深，来宾只愁挤不进堂厢，上楼厢站着听一夜也要过过戏瘾。康圣人如何？天先生怎样？川剧大王张二爷一腔定太平。唐三千，宋八百，数不完的三列国。偶有“下江”班子入川混饭吃，给它两瓢羹吧。强龙难斗地头蛇，一个老鸹守个滩，巴蜀梨园码头，谁敢与川剧龙头舵爷分庭抗礼……
    总之，今日若不振到以上三种流向之一种水平，则为不兴不旺，则为整垮整朽儿！
    同志哥，别作梦，鼎盛春秋飞旋去，挽啊，挽不回黄金时节！
    我有意识流，少闪回，向前看——当今观众，尤其青年观众是有史以来最难伺候的“上帝”。这一代小小老人家，与文艺的关系已经结束了“一夫一妻制”。喜新厌旧，朝秦暮楚，一会儿嫌环肥，一会儿嫌燕瘦，一手推开虞美人，一手伸向洋婆子。真若直达爱丽舍宫，追求高级粉黛，云游艺术世界，丰富审美情趣，我看是好事。未老莫还乡，还乡须断肠。说不定哪天叶落归根，游子思家，绿衣人似花，还是白娘子、尤二姐、四姑娘、芙蓉花仙温柔。娘们别干等，打扮一番流行色，画眉深浅入时无？适应是为了征服，再降个调，适应是为了生存，在适应上帝的同时，引导上帝来适应我们，只要能在三千佳丽、十二金钗之中保存一席菊部蜀葩，分享几夜风流，便是复兴开始了。
    从这个标准检验：成都、新都、雾都、盐都……都有可喜收获；甜城、果城、雨城、涪城……小城不乏小春。几回荧屏竞技，几度京华夺魁，四朵梅花，五枚金牌，至少剧本文学在全国剧坛大获殊荣，川军不弱。能说咱们川剧朽成白卷先生了吗？成果累累，天日昭昭！
    意识流飞越——正当振兴有望，不料经济危机引起文化危机。上面节约财资，精简剧团，下面爆发超前享乐低级文化思潮！
    此潮早已席卷西方，强国富邦养得起纨袴子弟，无损大局。一穷二白大家庭怎么供得起上亿的少爷小姐？奇怪，两年前玩兴尚被志气抵消，为何这阵子志气将被玩兴淹没？或许小青年、大学生曾以满腔童心关注国家大事，碰一鼻子灰，塞一嘴马粪，经不起风吹雨打，无沧桑中年之坚韧，露陌上柔桑之脆弱。国事管它娘，打打麻将。从忧世济世变为与世沉浮，玩世不恭。对什么都得加上“玩”字，玩哲学，玩宗教，玩大佛脐眼，玩观音酥胸。十步岂无芳草？青春辈中确有才华出众，品学兼优，它日腾蛟起凤之高明后生。但亦有高到玄之又玄者，看文艺以看不懂的为佳品，凡能看懂的不屑一看。哥姐佯狂，传染弟妹，小不点儿几分无瑕、几分无知、几分无聊、痛心是几分无耻！不爱风流高格调，专拣装潢五光十色，内囊一色稻草的低档文化。百货飞涨，唯有文化素质大跌价，欣赏水平大滑坡。跳舞扭摆学床上动作，唱歌腔调仿性交呻吟。歌星扭下台去摸一摸观众是演出必由之路，观众拥上台去啃一啃歌星是文艺最佳境界。世上戏比台上戏丰富多彩，官爷“倒”得快，儿女“垮”得快，倒垮竞赛，你腐败我比你更腐败！吃喝嫖赌加武打，没钱学拉兹，去偷去抢去杀人去放火！大不了进去唱囚歌，混得出来是个迟志强，混不出来，英雄含笑上刑场，拜拜，二十年后又来玩……
    哎哟，上帝！川剧无论怎样适应，怎样改革，也赶不上这个趟啊！当代优秀文学，海外高雅艺术，通通暂时靠边站。川戏班子算老几？门庭若不冷落，那才怪哩！
    有志振兴者碰上这么个气候真够呛，既要千方百计改革川剧本身的僵化，又不能卖笑卖身去迎合上帝的腐化。怎样才算现代化？咀嚼苦果，慢慢消化。
    莫怪我的意识流跑远了，就戏论戏说不深透，功夫在戏外，登高宏观，振兴川剧附属在振兴中华的大背景下，没法子超越社会的经济文化困境而独自拔地飞升。戏剧何时走出低谷？当问中华何时攀登高峰？……
