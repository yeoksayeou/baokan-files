Nepalese Foreign Minister Upaadhyaya said he is confident that the current issues between Nepal and India can be resolved through talks, as long as both sides prioritize the century-long friendship between the two countries.

Upaadhyaya made these remarks at a press conference held in Kathmandu yesterday.

He also said that there is still room for resolving issues between the two countries and that there is no need for a third country to mediate at this point.

He emphasized that Nepal has made many efforts to resolve issues between the two countries and does not want these problems to continue.

He pointed out that Nepal has repeatedly asked India to suggest a time, level, location, and agenda for bilateral talks, but India has consistently ignored these requests.
