Lü Jian to Shao Yanxiang

Yanxiang Brother:

I have read the eleventh issue of "Poetry Magazine." Niu Han's "Two Halves of a Coin" is heart-rending, but it also gives one hope. The poet, with his soul and blood, has touched the depths of life. This is a very powerful poem, worthy of being the lead article.

In the same issue, I was delighted to read Nie Ganran's "Four Seven-Character Quatrains," including one titled "In Response to Lü Jian's Request for a Poem," which was quite unexpected. I remember that in the autumn of 1983, my younger brother, with great difficulty, moved to his new residence in Xicheng. Seeing that there was half a mu of land in front of the house, suitable for planting flowers and trees, and that it was also a separate courtyard, he named his study "Half-Mu Garden," thinking that he had not entirely shed the habits of a literati. Many friends, upon hearing this, sent poems to congratulate him. Some even suggested that it would be a great idea to invite poems from fellow literati and friends, compiling them into a long scroll. This sentiment was conveyed to Master Nie by Shuwo Brother, and soon after, I received a handwritten seven-character quatrain from him.

The heart is warm, writing a poem to present to the Lü family, though it has nothing to do with the topic, and I myself do not understand how to write it, just to fulfill the obligation and present it.

The setting sun over Yan Mountain laments the child,
This sentiment should be known by Lu Xun.
Thousand-year-old fortresses, thousand mountains of snow,
One tree of plum blossoms, one poem.
The moon is full in the courtyard, people sleep early,
The stars of the Big Dipper shine, waking from drunkenness late.
Thinking of calling to ask about your dream,
Dialed three times, forgot the fourth digit.

Nie Ganran's draft
February 14, 1984, Beijing

The phrase "unrelated to the topic, not understanding how to write" is self-deprecating. At that time, Master Nie had moved to the eastern suburb of Jingsong District, and since I had moved west, there was the line "The setting sun over Yan Mountain." Master Nie had been exiled to the Great Northern Wilderness, and I had also been "sent down" to the frontier, hence the line "Thousand-year-old fortresses." The rest is mostly imaginative and comforting words, of course, with a bit of joking.

But the important thing is that we indeed heard the warmth of this old man's heart. At that time, he could only sit stiffly on his bed.

Let's not talk about that. Now, comparing the draft "not yet a draft" with the published version, one can see that Master Nie made significant revisions. Master Nie is indeed a genius of his time, and his scholarly pursuit of rigor is also worthy of our emulation. The published version notes that it was written in "1983," perhaps indicating the time when the poem was first conceived, or was "1984" mistakenly recorded as "1983"? The details of this, I have not yet had the chance to ask Master Nie. However, this draft's first line, "The setting sun over Yan Mountain laments the child," the "child" is clearly a misprint of "laments." Although it is only one character different, it makes the sentence meaningless and cannot be taken lightly. I dare to trouble the editorial department to check it, or to correct it if necessary. What do you think? Please consider it.

The sample book of the old-style poetry collection "Qing Gai Ji" by Nie Ganran and nine others, including myself, arrived yesterday. In the current situation, it is surprisingly well printed. As soon as the formal printed version arrives, I will immediately send it to you for appreciation (I am only a beginner in old-style poetry and only occasionally write it, so it is a matter of asking for your guidance, which is another matter).

Yours sincerely,
Lü Jian
November 25, 1984, Morning

Editor's Note: The official draft of Nie Ganran is as follows:

Presented in response to the request for a poem

The setting sun over Yan Mountain laments the child,
The rivers and mountains are beautiful, but people are foolish.
Thousand-year-old fortresses, thousand mountains of snow,
Eternal plum blossoms, eternal poems.
The moon is full in the courtyard, spring sleep comes early,
The stars of the Big Dipper shine, waking from drunkenness late.
Thinking of calling to ask about your dream,
Just dialed three times, forgot the fourth digit.
("Scattered and Comfortable Poems," revised and annotated edition, according to "Poetry Magazine," temporarily unaware, the "laments" character was mistakenly carried over.)

### 吕剑致邵燕祥  关于聂绀弩的一首诗

第8版(副刊)

　　吕剑致邵燕祥    
    关于聂绀弩的一首诗
    燕祥兄：
    《诗刊》第十一期已经读到。牛汉的《二分硬币》令人心头震颤，但也令人看到了希望。诗人以其心灵和热血，触到了生活的一定的深处。这是一首很有力量的诗，宜乎发头条。
    也就在同一期上，高兴地读到了聂翁的《七律四首》，其中竟有《吕剑索诗》一首，出人意外。忆弟于１９８３年秋好不容易迁来城西新居之初，见房前有地半分，略可栽植花木，且又自成一院，遂命寒斋为《半分园》，自思未脱文人习气。不少朋友闻之，赠诗相贺，有人且谓，何妨遍征“倾盖”同仁及好友之诗，合为一长卷，岂不又一盛事！此情承舒芜兄转告聂翁，不久即蒙其手写七律一首寄示。
    心热做一诗赠吕剑诗家及成与题无涉且自亦不解作谓聊以塞责呈政
    落日燕山吊子之，
    此情当有鲁翁知。
    千年古戍千山雪，
    一树梅花一首诗。
    月满中庭人睡早，
    星辉北斗酒醒迟。
    思传电话询君梦，
    拨了三江忘四支。
    　聂绀弩未是草
    １９８４年２月１４日，北京
    此处所谓“与题无涉、不解作谓”云云，盖自谦也。这时聂翁已移居东郊劲松区，我既西来，乃有“落日燕山”之句。聂翁曾流放北大荒，我亦曾“下放”塞上，乃有“千年古戍”之句。此外则多想象、慰藉之词，当然也有一点开玩笑。
    但重要的是，我们毕竟听到了这位老人的那颗热的心。这时他已经只能依被僵坐于床第之上了。
    这且不说。如今将“未是草”和正式发表稿对照一读，可以看出聂翁又作了不小的改动。聂翁固为一世之奇才，而其治学之求严精神，亦足为吾人之师法。发表稿题下注明作于“１９８３”，或指最初酝酿得诗之时间，或“八四”误记为“八三”？此中消息，弟尚未及向聂翁请教。惟此稿第一句“落日燕山弟子之”，“弟”显系“吊”之误植。虽只一字之差，但陷于句意不通，固不可轻易待之。敢烦编辑部一查，或以更正一下为宜。如何？乞酌。
    聂翁及弟等九人旧体诗合集《倾盖集》样书日昨一到，在目前来说，印制得出人意外的不错。一俟正式印本寄到，当立即寄供一赏（弟于旧诗只是初学，且只是偶而为之，是请兄指教的问题，那是另一回事）。
    　不一。即颂吟安
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　吕剑顿首
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　１９８４年１１月２５日晨
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    编者按：聂绀弩正式稿本如下：
    　　　　呈剑索诗
    落日燕山吊子之，
    河山信美奈人痴。
    千年苦戍千山雪，
    万古梅花万首诗。
    月满中庭春睡早，
    星辉北斗酒醒迟。
    思恁电话询君梦，
    才拨三江忘四支。
    （《散宜生诗》增订、注释本，据《诗刊》收入，一时不察，“吊”字又相沿而误。）
