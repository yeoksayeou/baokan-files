To improve animal breeds and treat human diseases, significant progress has been made in the research of genetic engineering technology, which can alter genetic traits, over the past decade.

Currently, American scientists have conducted numerous gene transplantation experiments in the laboratory. They use a fine needle to inject the genetic material DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) from one animal's genes directly into the nucleus of another animal's fertilized egg cell or early embryo. They then promote its growth in the animal's uterus, and after it is born and grown, it is mated with the same species. The offspring will have the foreign gene and thus possess new genetic traits.

There are approximately 3,000 types of human diseases. If a specific gene in the body can be improved, it is hoped that certain diseases can be cured. So far, gene transplantation technology in the United States has only been conducted on animals such as mice. On January 19 of this year, the U.S. government approved for the first time gene transplantation experiments on patients to study the condition of cancer cells and cancer treatment methods.

In animals, the production of special drugs for treating certain human diseases through gene transplantation engineering has made significant progress in the United States. For example, TPA (tissue plasminogen activator) in human blood can dissolve blood clots. Scientists have used genetic engineering methods to produce this substance, saving several critically ill heart disease patients. However, the current production cost is high and the yield is low. In recent years, American scientists have successfully bred over 1,000 mice by transferring human genes into them, which can produce milk containing TPA. The cost is low and the yield is high. To obtain more TPA, they are further researching the use of human gene transplantation engineering to breed dairy sheep. Currently, they are in the final stage, and it is expected to be successful within this year. British biologist Katherine Gordon recently said that they plan to breed 100 to 200 goats with human genes, and the TPA produced by the goats' milk each year can be used nationwide in the United States. If 300 goats are bred, the production can be used by heart disease patients worldwide.

The development of gene transplantation engineering also has important implications for animal husbandry. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and Michigan State University have successfully conducted experiments by transplanting genes that can prevent viral invasion into cells into chickens. This method breeds chickens that are not affected by avian leukosis virus, and if widely promoted, it can reduce annual losses in the U.S. poultry industry by $50 million to $100 million.

American scientists have also used gene transplantation technology to breed pigs, sheep, and fish. Using gene transplantation technology can make pigs leaner with less fat, sheep with more and better quality wool, and fish grow larger in a short period. They have also bred a cow with foreign genes, and the situation is still under observation.

Dr. Rudd recently said, "Using gene transplantation technology, the characteristics of a certain animal can be changed in a short period, equivalent to its development over millions of years." However, gene transplantation engineering is a new high-tech field with many problems yet to be resolved.

　　美国“基因工程”的新进展
    本报记者  刘开宸
    为了改良动物品种和治疗人类疾病，近１０年来，人们在研究可以改变遗传特性的基因工程技术方面取得了新进展。
    目前，美国科学家已在实验室里进行了大量的基因移植实验。他们是用微细的针，把某一种动物基因中的遗传物质ＤＮＡ（脱氧核糖核酸）直接注射进另一种动物的受精卵细胞核内或早期的胚胎内，然后促其在动物的子宫内成长，出生长大后与同种动物交配，其后代体内就有外来基因，因而具有新的遗传特性。
    人类约有３０００种疾病。如能改良其体内某一特别基因，就可望治愈某种疾病。迄今为止，美国进行基因移植技术只是在老鼠等动物身上进行的。今年１月１９日，美国政府第一次批准可在病人的身上进行基因移植试验，以便对癌细胞情况和治癌办法进行研究。
    在动物身上，通过基因移植工程，生产可以治疗人类某种疑难病特效药的试验，已在美国获得很大进展。如人血中的ＴＰＡ（组织纤维蛋白溶酶），可以溶解血块。科学家曾用基因工程方法制造出这种物质，救活了一些生命垂危的心脏病人。但目前造价昂贵，产量也少。近几年，美国科学家通过把人的基因移入老鼠的办法，育出１０００多只老鼠，能生产含有ＴＰＡ的奶，成本低，产量多。为了获取更多的ＴＰＡ，他们正在进一步研究用人的基因移植工程培育奶羊，目前，已到最后阶段，今年内可望试验成功。英国生物学家凯瑟林·戈登最近说，他们打算培育出１００到２００只具有人的基因的山羊，每年羊奶所产的ＴＰＡ，可供美国全国之用。如育出３００只，其产量则可供全世界心脏病人用。
    基因移植工程发展对饲养业也有重要作用。美国农业部和密执安州立大学合作，把能阻挠病毒侵入细胞的基因移植到鸡体内的试验已经成功。这种方法繁殖的鸡不怕鸟类白血病毒的危害，如能推广，美国养鸡业每年可减少５０００万到１亿美元的损失。
    美国科学家还用基因移植技术繁殖猪、羊、鱼。采用基因移植技术能使猪膘少，瘦肉多，绵羊的毛多且质量好，鱼在短期内长得快而大。他们还培养了一只有外来基因的牛，情况如何，尚在观察中。
    美国科学家鲁德博士最近说：“使用基因移植技术，可使某种动物性质在短时间内的改变，等于它几百万年的发展。”但是，基因移植工程是一项新兴的高科技，有许多难题还有待于研究。
