Xinhua News Agency, Batang, May 1st.

The State Council's condolence delegation, which arrived in Batang, Sichuan on the 28th, has spent the past few days visiting villages, hospitals, schools, government agencies, and enterprises to understand the situation and comfort the affected people.

The delegation visited the severely affected Cha Shu Shan Village, going from house to house to offer comfort. A Tibetan woman, Yixi Zhimu, tears streaming down her face, told the deputy leader of the delegation, Chen Xin, vice-minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, "The earthquake was so severe, and the central government's comrades came to see us so quickly."

In the epicenter village of Xiaoba, the temporary road cleared after the first earthquake was destroyed again by the second strong aftershock. Currently, the area is still filled with smoke and dust. The delegation members, risking their lives, walked for over four hours to offer their comfort. The local Tibetans were deeply moved, with tears in their eyes. They said, "We are one family, Tibetans and Han. We are grateful for the help from our Han brothers."

According to a report from the Sichuan Provincial Seismological Bureau's on-site command center, there is a possibility of another 5-6 magnitude earthquake in the Batang area in the short term. Currently, Batang and the surrounding counties have taken measures to organize the evacuation of people from dangerous buildings and areas.

　　国务院慰问团    
    深入巴塘震区
    新华社巴塘５月１日电  （记者陈燮）２８日抵达四川巴塘震区的国务院慰问团，几天来分头深入到乡村、医院、学校、机关和企事业单位，了解灾情，慰问受灾群众。
    慰问团来到重灾区茶树山村，挨家挨户走访慰问。藏族妇女益西志玛流着热泪对慰问团副团长、国家民委副主任陈欣同志（女）说：“地震还这么厉害，中央的同志就来看我们了。”震中小坝村，第一次地震后，抢通的便道，在第二次强震中又被震塌，目前仍烟尘弥漫。慰问团的同志冒着生命危险，步行４个多小时，前来慰问。藏民们感动得热泪盈眶，藏胞们说，藏汉一家，我们感谢汉族兄弟的帮助。
    根据四川省地震局现场指挥部报告，估计巴塘地区短期内还有可能发生５—６级地震。目前，巴塘及邻近各县已采取措施，组织群众撤离危险建筑和危险区。
