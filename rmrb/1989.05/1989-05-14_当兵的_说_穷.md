	Soldiers Speak of Poverty
	By a Soldier of the People's Liberation Army, Yan Ze Bo

	I have heard people call soldiers "poor soldiers" more than once, and I have also been called that. "Soldiers" are "soldiers," why must the word "poor" be added in front?

	I had a childhood friend who went to school with me and worked together in a construction team. Later, I joined the army, and he started his own construction team. Now, I am still a soldier, but he has become the deputy manager of a construction group company, earning a monthly salary much higher than my annual allowance. To be honest, I was not inferior to him in the past, but now, compared to him and many of my peers in civilian life, I have to admit that I am poor. Economically, there is a wealth gap between us, but in terms of personal dignity, we are still equal. Why do some people insist on calling us "poor soldiers"? Is there a sense of ridicule or mockery in it?

	There was a soldier who was in a romantic relationship with a girl from his hometown. Suddenly, he received a breakup letter from her. It turned out that some people in his hometown did not understand why the girl would choose a "poor soldier" as her husband, saying that marrying a "poor soldier" was not practical. Under the pressure of gossip, the girl wavered.

	The Chinese people have been poor for too long. Moreover, under the impact of the commercial economy, people's thoughts and ideas have changed, and they no longer think that being poor is glorious. Soldiers are poor, not because they are incapable. If placed in the same environment, most of them would not be inferior to their peers. They are willing to endure hardship in the army because they want to fulfill their honorable duty as citizens.

	When the fires in the Great Khingan Mountains were raging, when the waters of the Panlong River were roaring, after the blue light of the earthquake in Yunnan, and in the smoky battlefield of the southern border, "soldiers" were the most respected and beloved people. But as soon as they washed off the dust of battle, the cries of "poor soldiers" resounded again. This is not only because soldiers are "poor," but also reflects the weak national defense consciousness of many people.

	In economic construction, there was once a saying, "No industry, no wealth; no commerce, no vitality." Later, someone added, "No army, no security." As descendants of the Yellow Emperor and the Chinese nation, if no one is willing to serve in the army, what will the consequences be? National prosperity and strength cannot be achieved without an army. Only when "soldiers" are willing to endure hardship (of course, as the nation becomes prosperous and strong, this hardship will change), can more people become wealthy, can our country become strong, and can our nation thrive.

	I remember a famous military theorist once said: "If in a country, those who sacrifice their lives, health, and property to defend their homeland are not as respected as those fat merchants, then the destruction of that country would not be unjustified." Wake up, those with weak national defense consciousness!

### “当兵的”说“穷”

　　“当兵的”说“穷”
    解放军某部战士  严泽波
    我不只一次听人喊“穷当兵的”，我也被人这么喊过。“当兵的”就“当兵的”，为什么一定要在前面加个“穷”呢？
    我有一个童年的伙伴，曾在一起上学，又一起到建筑队做小工。后来我当了兵，他拉起了一支建筑队。现在，我仍是一个兵，他却成了建筑集团公司的副经理，一个月工资比我一年的津贴还要多得多。凭心而论，当初我并不比他差，可现在和他相比，和地方众多同龄人相比，我不得不承认，我穷。在经济上我们有贫富之差，在人格上，我们还是平等的。可为什么有些人一定要叫我们“穷当兵的”呢？其中是否带有侮辱、挖苦之意？
    有位战士，与家乡一位姑娘正在热恋，突然收到女方的绝交信。原来是当地一些人对姑娘找“当兵的”很不理解，说什么找“穷当兵的”做丈夫不实惠。迫于流言蜚语，姑娘动摇了。
    中国人是穷怕了。何况在商品经济大潮冲击下，人们的思想观念已经变化，已不再像以前那样认为穷是光荣的了。“当兵的”穷，不是他们无能。若在同样的环境里，他们之中的大多数不会比同龄人差。他们所以要在部队甘愿受穷，是因为他们要尽一个公民应尽的光荣义务。
    在大兴安岭山火熊熊燃烧的时候，当盘龙江的洪水咆哮作恶的时候，在云南地震的蓝光闪过之后，在南疆弥漫的硝烟中，“当兵的”是最可敬、最可亲的人。可他们刚刚洗去征尘，“穷当兵的”叫喊声又响起来了。这不仅因为当兵的“穷”，也反映出不少人国防意识的淡薄。
    在经济建设中，曾有过“无工不富、无商不活”的说法，后来，有人又加了一句“无兵不安”。作为炎黄子孙、华夏后代，倘若都不愿当兵，后果又将如何？国富民强，不可一日无兵。只有“当兵的”甘愿受穷（当然，随着国富民强，这个穷也是会变的），才能使更多的人致富，使我们的国家富强，使我们的民族兴旺。
    记得一位世界著名军事理论家曾经说过：“假如在一个国家里，那些牺牲生命、健康和财产去保卫祖国的勇士们，还不如那些大腹便便的商贾受到尊重，那么这个国家的灭亡就一定也不冤枉了。”醒醒吧，国防观念淡薄的人们！
