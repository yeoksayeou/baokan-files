Entering the compound of the Suining Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government, one does not see any office buildings; all the offices are in simple, dilapidated flat-rooms. However, compared to 1984, the year before the city was established, the total industrial and agricultural output value of the city has increased by 53%; fiscal revenue has increased by 1.44 times, with an annual contribution of 16 to 17 million yuan to the provincial treasury, and several consecutive years of balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure. The clean and efficient administration of Suining's municipal leaders, who focus on practical work, has been praised by the province and the people.

Suining is a typical agricultural hilly area. When the city was established, although there was a start-up fund, the municipal leaders saw that the city's industry and agriculture were backward, and there were many educational debts, and the urban streets were narrow and crowded. Therefore, they decided not to build office buildings for the municipal Party Committee and Government, or to purchase cars, but to insist on hard work and diligence, and to seriously serve the people with practical actions.

In the few years since the city was established, they have concentrated their limited funds on developing industrial and agricultural production, education, and old city renovation projects. Currently, the offices of the Municipal Party Committee and Government are old and crowded, and the People's Congress, Political Consultative Conference, and public prosecution and law enforcement departments are still working in dormitories. The leaders of the Municipal Party Committee and Government also live in ordinary dormitories. The Municipal Party Committee and Government, and various departments have few cars, which are of low grade and in short supply. The Propaganda Department, Social Sciences Association, Lecture Team, Civilization Office, and Correspondence College share one Laida brand car. In addition, educational investment accounts for 1/3 of the city's total fiscal expenditure each year. Through several years of efforts, this unremarkable city has achieved universal primary education, with the enrollment rate and promotion rate of primary and secondary school students both ranking among the top in the province.

### 办公条件从简　为民办事尚实  遂宁廉洁行政上下称道

　　办公条件从简　为民办事尚实
    遂宁廉洁行政上下称道
    本报成都５月２４日电  记者罗茂城报道：走进四川省遂宁市委、市府大院，看不到办公大楼，所有办公室都是简陋破旧的平房。然而，去年与建市前的１９８４年相比，全市工农业总产值增长５３％；财政收入增长１．４４倍，每年上交省财政一千六七百万元，连续几年财政收支平衡。遂宁市领导廉洁行政办实事的作风，受到省里和人民群众的称赞。
    遂宁是个典型的农业丘陵地区。建市时，虽有一笔开办经费，但市领导看到全市工农业落后，教育欠帐较多，城区街道狭窄拥挤，于是，决定先不修市委、市府的办公楼和购买小汽车，而是坚持艰苦奋斗，认真为老百姓办实事。
    建市几年来，他们把有限的资金集中用于发展工农业生产、教育事业和旧城改造等项目上。目前，市委、市府办公室陈旧拥挤，人大、政协、公检法等部门还在宿舍办公。市委、市府领导也与职工一样住普通宿舍。市委、市府和各部门汽车数量少，档次低，用车紧张。宣传部、社科联、讲师团、文明办和函授院５个单位合用一台拉达牌小车。此外，教育投资每年占市财政总支出的１／３。通过几年的努力，这个并不引人注目的城市普及了初等教育，中小学生上学率和升学率均进入全省前几名行列。
