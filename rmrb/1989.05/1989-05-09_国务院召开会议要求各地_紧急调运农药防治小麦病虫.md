The State Council held a meeting on May 8, convened by State Councilor Chen Junsheng, with leaders from 12 provinces and municipalities and relevant departments of the State Council. The meeting was held to deploy the urgent transportation of pesticides to control wheat diseases and pests, ensuring a bumper summer grain harvest this year.

The meeting required wheat-producing regions to tap into commercial reserves and the production and storage potential of pesticide enterprises, prioritizing the use of these pesticides for urgent wheat disease and pest control. For the current shortage of pesticides reported by several provinces, the State Council's Agricultural Production Materials Coordination Leading Group, in accordance with the meeting's requirements, is working with relevant departments such as agriculture, commerce, and chemical industry to implement specific measures to address the issue province by province.

Chen Junsheng emphasized that pesticide-producing regions must consider the overall situation and comply with the national unified dispatch. The required pesticides must be transported with full effort by the railway and other transportation departments to ensure timely delivery.
