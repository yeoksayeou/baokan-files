A young worker from the Luoyang Railway Water and Electricity Section, Sun Fuyun, was injured in a struggle with criminals and later died due to the Luoyang First People's Hospital's refusal to provide timely treatment without payment, highlighting a severe breach of medical ethics.

At around 1:00 PM on April 20, four criminals were caught stealing on a public bus and attacked a worker. Sun Fuyun, a 20-year-old railway worker, saw the incident and rushed to help, engaging in a struggle with the criminals. He was stabbed five times and fell into a pool of blood. The criminals escaped in the chaos. The bus driver, ticket seller, and several passengers immediately took Sun Fuyun to the nearby Luoyang First People's Hospital for emergency treatment. They explained the situation to the doctors, urging them to save the injured worker. However, the doctors responded coldly and made Sun Fuyun lie on the cement floor of the hallway, demanding 1,000 yuan upfront to process the admission. Unable to produce that much money immediately, they offered their work IDs, military IDs, and watches as collateral, promising to pay later. The doctors replied, "The hospital has its regulations; we have to consider economic benefits. I have no other choice."

The hospital performed some temporary treatments on the injured worker but continued to demand exorbitant fees. The cost for external injury treatment was initially marked at 40 yuan, but a nurse noticed and corrected it to 20 yuan. The X-ray fee, originally priced at 30 yuan, was increased to 60 yuan by the doctor. After repeated pleas, they paid 45 yuan.

By 5:00 PM, the injured worker's condition worsened due to severe bleeding, requiring immediate blood transfusion. The doctors insisted on receiving payment before providing the transfusion. The police officer and the beaten worker rushed to borrow money. After gathering the transfusion fee, they struggled to find someone to collect the payment. Finally, after much delay, a few nurses on duty, who were chatting, reluctantly went to prepare the blood. By the time they returned, it was past 8:00 PM. The injured worker was unable to receive the blood transfusion or oxygen. At 9:20 PM, the brave worker died due to the delay in treatment. An autopsy by the public security authorities confirmed the cause of death as hemorrhagic shock.

The tragic death of railway worker Sun Fuyun sparked outrage among the people of Luoyang, who demanded a serious investigation into this severe breach of medical ethics.

The four criminals who injured Sun Fuyun were all apprehended by the public security authorities on the same day.

　　青工见义勇为遭毒手　医院不顾人命只认钱    
    洛阳一医院如此医德
    本报讯  洛阳铁路水电段青年工人孙富君，在与歹徒搏斗中负伤后，由于洛阳市第一人民医院只顾要钱，不及时抢救，使这位见义勇为的工人不幸失血死亡。
    ４月２０日下午一时许，四个歹徒在５路公共汽车上行窃被察觉，便狠狠围打一个工人，２０岁的铁路工人孙富君见情上前救助，与歹徒展开搏斗，被刺５刀倒在血泊中，歹徒乘乱逃窜。汽车司机、售票员与几个乘客立即把孙富君送到附近的洛阳市第一人民医院抢救。他们向医生介绍了受伤者与歹徒搏斗的情况，恳求抓紧救治。但对方反应冷淡，竟让伤员躺在走廊的水泥地上，要他们拿出１０００元先去办理住院手续。他们一时拿不出这么多钱，就拿出工作证、军人证和手表等物作抵押，表示事后一定如数交钱。但医生说：“医院就是这种规定，要讲经济效益，我也没有办法。”
    医院对伤员草草作了些临时处置，却又漫天乱要钱。外伤处置费用，划价的竟写了４０元，被一位护士发现，才改为２０元。拍片费原来划价３０元，这位医生竟改为６０元，经护送者一再苦求，交了４５元。
    到下午５时，伤员由于大量出血，病情转危，急需输血。医生却要护送者先交钱，再输血。护送伤员的公安局干部与那位被打的工人到处去借钱，输血费凑齐后，却找不到医院里负责收费的人，好不容易交了钱，几个值班护士却在聊天，不去抓紧取血，经一再催促，护士才慢吞吞地走去取了血。此时已是下午８点多钟，伤员已无法输血与吸氧，到９点２０分，这位见义勇为的工人由于未能及时救治，终于死去。经公安部门法医鉴定，为失血性休克死亡。
    铁路工人孙富君的不幸死亡事件，在洛阳市群众中引起了强烈反响，人们纷纷要求严肃处理这起违反医德的严重事件。
    砍伤孙富君的四名歹徒，已在当天被公安部门全部抓获归案。
