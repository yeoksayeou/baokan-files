In the face of the nation's tight monetary policy and the sharp rise in the prices of means of production, the cash income of Chinese farmers in the first quarter of this year still saw a significant increase compared to the same period last year. According to the latest sample survey by the Rural Survey Office of the National Bureau of Statistics, the per capita cash income of Chinese farmers in the first quarter reached 162 yuan (excluding savings and loan cash income, the same below), an increase of 37 yuan compared to the same period last year, a growth of 29.9%. After deducting the factor of price increases, the actual growth was 3.4%.

The survey shows that the increase in the prices of agricultural and livestock products is the main reason for the increase in farmers' cash income. In the first quarter, the per capita income from the sale of agricultural and livestock products was 81.1 yuan, an increase of 21.6 yuan compared to the same period last year, a growth of 36.3%. Of this, the income increased due to price rises accounted for 70.2%. The growth in farmers' cash income from engaging in secondary and tertiary industries in the first quarter was also relatively fast.
