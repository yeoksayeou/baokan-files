Title: Renouncing the "God" Crown

The revival of a commodity economy has seen consumers unknowingly crowned with the title of "God." However, in China, being a "God" requires more than divine qualities. In restaurants, beer poured into glasses has expired and gone bad, poorly made dishes are exorbitantly priced, and after waiting a long time for an egg soup, one finds a fly floating in it. Faced with all this, the "God" shows remarkable patience, neither hurried nor angry, accepting whatever comes. In public bathhouses, the hot water in the pool is scalding, while the water from the showerhead is icy cold. Instead of finding the attendant to resolve the issue, people sit by the pool waiting for the water to cool down, appearing calm and composed.

Some say that the common people's tolerance is still fragile and needs to be strengthened. I, however, feel that their psychological tolerance has become too flexible, to the point of bearing too much that they should not have to endure.

Since "God" is a foreign concept, let's first see how Western consumers act as "Gods." According to Agence France-Presse, a female student in Lyon, France, bought a sandwich with maggots from a small shop. She was dissatisfied with the shopkeeper's response of merely offering to exchange it, so she filed a lawsuit. Soon, the Lyon petty crimes court ruled that the guarantor and the company owning four shops selling such sandwiches be fined 15,000 francs, and the student be compensated 1,000 francs for her losses, with an additional 5,000 francs compensation to the Rhône consumer association.

Being a true "God" in today's China is difficult. The commodity economy is relatively backward, a buyer's market has not yet formed, and legal awareness is generally weak. These objective conditions are far from being met. Therefore, I do not dare to ask you to sue the restaurant that serves fly-infested egg soup, but I do hope you dare to ask the boss for a replacement. I hope to see you demanding a bit of service worthy of the money you earned with your blood and sweat. If this wish is still too extravagant, then our "God" is truly beyond help. Because he has the right to do so, and because such behavior, which is not overly demanding, helps the prosperity of the commodity economy and the progress of the service industry. Otherwise, it is better to renounce the "God" crown.

### 辞“上帝”桂冠

　　辞“上帝”桂冠
    刘东华
    商品经济苏醒了，消费者头上不知何时被安上了一顶“上帝”的桂冠。
    然而在中国当“上帝”必须有超乎上帝的修养。在饭店，倒进杯里的啤酒已过期变质，粗制滥作的饭菜贵得出格，好不容易等来的蛋汤里又漂着只苍蝇，面对这一切，“上帝”表现出惊人的大度，不急、不愠，随遇而安。在公共浴室，浴池里的热水滚烫若沸，喷头中的冷水冰凉刺骨，既不敢下池，又不能淋浴的同胞们不是去找服务员解决问题，而是坐在浴池边上等水降温，神态安闲……
    有人说，普通群众的承受力还很脆弱，有待增强。我却觉得他们的心理承受力已柔韧过度，乃至承受了过多不应承受的东西。
    “上帝”既是舶来品，我们不妨先看看西方的消费者是怎样做“上帝”的。据法新社报道，法国里昂市的一名女中学生在小卖部买了块有蛆的三明治。她对女售货员只是“给换一块”的反应表示不满，于是提出控告。不久，里昂轻罪法庭判决担保人和拥有四家出售这种三明治的小卖部的公司罚款一万五千法郎，并给那位女学生赔偿损失一千法郎，给罗纳河消费者协会赔偿损失五千法郎。
    在今日中国做名副其实的“上帝”很难。商品经济相对落后，买方市场尚未形成，法制观念普遍淡漠等等，客观条件还远不具备。因此，我不敢要求你去控告那家作鸡蛋苍蝇汤的饭店，而只是希望你敢于向老板要求换一碗，希望看到你在用自己的血汗钱时，能得到一点点与之相称的服务。如果我这个愿望仍然过于奢侈的话，那我们的“上帝”就实在无药可治了。因为他本来就有这个权利，更因为这种并不苛求的行为有助于商品经济的繁荣和社会服务业的进步。否则，不如辞掉“上帝”这顶桂冠了事。　　　　　　　　刘东华
