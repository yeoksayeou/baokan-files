In West Germany, if the evergreen soccer fields are the playgrounds for boys during their free time, then for girls, the gymnasium is the most attractive place. Currently, the gymnastics association is the second-largest single-sport federation in the Federal Republic of Germany, with over 3 million members, more than 80% of whom are young girls.

Not long ago, during a visit to West Germany, I interviewed a gymnastics club. The club's activities were held in the gymnasium of a middle school in Essen. It is said that almost every school in West Germany has a gymnasium similar to a small sports hall, and schools without this facility are not allowed to operate.

Interestingly, there were no balance beams, uneven bars, or other competitive gymnastics equipment in the gymnasium. It turns out that most gymnastics clubs mainly focus on artistic gymnastics, with only a small portion practicing competitive gymnastics.

Student Ute is a quiet girl who loves reading. At just 11 years old, she already wears a pair of large glasses. Even such a girl who doesn't like to move around has been attracted to the gymnastics club. She told me that the purpose of joining the club is not to become an athlete but to find that accompanying pleasant music, learning rope exercises, ribbon exercises, ball exercises, hoop exercises, and hand exercises with the teacher is an indescribable artistic enjoyment, and it also helps to fully stretch the body. Ute participates in a regular class with nearly 20 students, meeting once a week for about two hours. Each person pays a monthly fee of 4 Marks.

There are many regular classes in the gymnastics club, of course, and there are also advanced classes. Advanced classes train more frequently, have full-time coaches for guidance, and the students' skills are higher. If they perform well in competitions, they may even be selected for the national team. The students in the regular classes mainly engage in amateur hobbies and fitness, with coaches often being school physical education teachers who each lead several regular classes.

During the visit, what impressed me deeply was the high utilization rate of this gymnasium. Before 4 PM, the gymnasium is used for school physical education classes, and after 4 PM, it is rented out to the gymnastics club. One class follows another, with participants including middle school and elementary school students, as well as young working women. Other ball sports clubs also arrange activities here, using the facility until late in the evening, around 8 or 9 PM.

I learned from the coach that whether it is a large sports stadium that can accommodate tens of thousands of spectators or a simple school gymnasium, it will never be idle and unused. If there is a sports venue or gymnasium, there will be a sports club. It seems that the Germans' emphasis on efficiency in economic development is also applied to their daily mass sports activities.

Sports in West Germany have become an indispensable part of people's lives. Many people join sports activities for fitness and weight loss, but there are also many people who do not participate solely for fitness. Brigitte is one such example. This woman in her thirties lives in the Ruhr region's Mülheim city, teaches school while studying at a university, and enjoys swimming in her free time. The synchronized swimming group she organized initially included only her sister and friend Carla, but it later expanded to 10 people, including Chinese students and young people from Turkey and the Netherlands. They are mostly around 30 years old and got to know each other through exercise or social gatherings. When Brigitte accepted my interview, she said that their self-organized swimming group meets once or twice a week. The important thing is not to master swimming techniques but to gather good friends through group activities, deepen friendships, and keep the body and mind healthy and happy.

　　充满生机的西德大众体育
    本报记者  刘小明
    在西德，如果说四季常青的绿茵场是男孩子们课余游戏的乐园，对女孩子来讲，体操房则是最有吸引力的地方。目前体操协会是仅次于足协的联邦德国第二大单项体协，拥有３００多万会员，８０％以上是女青少年。
    前不久在西德访问期间，我采访了一所体操俱乐部。俱乐部的活动地点就在埃森市一个中学的健身房里。据说西德几乎每所中学都有一座近似小体育馆的健身房，不具备这一条件不准办学。
    奇怪的是健身房里根本没有摆着平衡木、高低杠等竞技体操的器械。原来，大多数体操俱乐部主要开展艺术体操，练竞技体操的只是一小部分。
    学员乌特是个文静的女孩子，喜欢看书，１１岁的小小年纪就架上一副大眼镜，连这样一位不好动的姑娘也被吸引到体操俱乐部来。她告诉我，参加俱乐部的目的并非想成为运动员，而是觉得伴随着悦耳的音乐，跟着老师学习绳操、彩带操、球操、圈操和徒手操，是一种妙不可言的艺术享受，而且使身体得到充分舒展。乌特参加的是一个普通班，有学员近２０人，每周活动一次，约两小时。每人一个月交４马克学费。
    体操俱乐部里有很多普通班，当然还有提高班。提高班训练次数较多，有专职教练指导，学员水平也高，如参加比赛成绩优异，还可能被选入国家队。普通班的学员主要是业余爱好和健身，教练多由学校体育教师兼任，每个教练要带好几个普通班。
    访问中给我印象很深的是这个健身房利用率非常高。下午４点以前健身房归学校体育课用，４点以后就借给体操俱乐部，一个班接着一个班活动，参加者有中小学生和职业女青年，其它球类俱乐部也在这里安排活动，每天一直使用到晚上八九点钟。
    我从教练那里了解到，无论是容纳成千上万观众的大体育馆，还是简易的学校健身房，都决不会闲置起来没人使用。有一处体育场馆或健身房，就会有一个体育俱乐部。看来，德国人在经济发展中讲究效率的特点，也用到了日常的大众体育活动中。
    体育在西德已成为人们生活中不可缺少的一个组成部分。不少人加入体育行列是为健身、减肥，也有很多人并不单纯为了健身，布瑞基特就是这样。这位３０多岁的女青年住在鲁尔地区明海姆市，边教书边读大学，业余爱好游泳。她组织的花样游泳小组起初仅有她妹妹和好友卡拉参加，后扩大到１０人，包括中国留学生及土耳其、荷兰的青年。她们大都３０岁左右，是在锻炼或朋友聚会时彼此相识的。布瑞基特接受我采访时说，她们这个自发的游泳小组每周活动一两次，重要的不是学会游泳技术，而是通过小组活动，好朋友们聚在一起增进感情和友谊，使身心健康愉快。　（附图片）
