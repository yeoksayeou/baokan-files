Title: On "Packaging"

Currently, the packaging of our products is still far from that of economically developed countries. However, the intangible "soft packaging" might be considered an invention. Let me give a few examples: Recently, numerous "companies," "associations," "centers," and "federations" have emerged like mushrooms after rain. Many of these have famous people or authorities as advisors, honorary chairmen, or honorary presidents, with great reputations but little actual involvement. Additionally, the endless flow of documents and the vast expanse of meetings also pay great attention to "decoration." Whenever a document is issued, it must be prefaced with instructions from some leader or approval from some famous person. No matter whose meeting it is, they always try every means to invite a few leaders or famous people to attend, to raise the meeting's status and value. My son passed the college entrance examination this year, and the whole family was overjoyed. However, when the results were announced, a certain university rejected his chosen major—"Industrial and Civil Construction"—and instead enrolled him in the "Resources and Environmental Science" department. It is already difficult for a child to get into college, so who would dare to be picky? But upon closer inquiry, it turned out that the department was originally the Geology Department. I was astonished! Fortunately, fortunately!

### “包装”别议

　　“包装”别议
    时下我们的商品包装还远不及经济发达的国家，可无形的“软包装”恐怕要算作一项发明。不妨举几种：时下如雨后春笋般涌现出来的“公司”、“学会”、“中心”、“协会”之类，总有一些名人、权威被聘为顾问、名誉董事长、名誉会长，名气颇大，视事甚少。还有那连绵不断的文山和一望无际的会海也都颇讲究“装璜”，凡发文件，总要冠之以据某某首长指示、经某某名人同意；不论谁家开会，总要千方百计请几位领导、名人光临，以提高会的规格身价。犬子今年高考得中，全家皆喜。可揭榜时，某学府将其所报专业——“工业与民用建筑”否决了，而改录取在“资源与环境科学”系。孩子能进大学，已属不易，岂敢多挑剔；可一细问，方知该系原是地质系所改。我不禁愕然了。幸哉，幸哉！
