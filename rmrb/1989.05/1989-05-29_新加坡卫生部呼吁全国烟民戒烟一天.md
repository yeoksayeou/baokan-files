Singapore's Ministry of Health today called on all smokers in the country to quit smoking for one day on May 31, the second World No-Tobacco Day.

The Ministry also urged shops to stop selling cigarettes for one day on No-Tobacco Day.

The Singapore government launched a national anti-smoking campaign three years ago, banning smoking in hospitals, fast-food restaurants, government offices, and other public places. The government also strictly regulates the nicotine and tar content in each cigarette, which must not exceed 1.3 milligrams and 15 milligrams, respectively. Additionally, the import tax on cigarettes has been increased.

In the 1989 fiscal year budget, the government further raised the tobacco tax by 10 Singapore dollars (2 Singapore dollars equal 1 US dollar), making the tax on each kilogram of tobacco as high as 85 Singapore dollars.

　　新加坡卫生部呼吁全国烟民戒烟一天
    新华社新加坡５月２８日电  新加坡卫生部今天呼吁全国烟民在５月３１日——世界第２个“无烟日”，戒烟１天。
    卫生部还呼吁商店在“无烟日”当天停售香烟１天。
    新加坡政府在３年前发起了全国控制吸烟运动，严禁在医院、快餐店、政府机关办公室等公共场所吸烟。政府还严格规定，每支卷烟的尼古丁和焦油含量必须在１．３毫克和１５毫克以下，同时提高了香烟的进口税。
    政府在１９８９年度财政预算中，又将烟税提高了１０新元（２新元合１美元），使每公斤烟草的税金高达８５新元。
