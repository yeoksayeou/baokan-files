Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 16th.

The number of fasting students fainting has sharply increased. As of today at 6 PM, 617 fasting students have been sent to the emergency center and 19 hospitals in the city, including Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing Tongren Hospital, and Beijing Friendship Hospital, for emergency treatment. A total of 247 students are still under observation and treatment in the hospitals.

According to the emergency center, on May 13th, some students from universities in the capital began fasting. They immediately dispatched ambulances and medical staff to the square. In recent days, Beijing has had a large temperature difference between day and night. In addition, the fasting students only drink water and are emotionally excited, which has led to a significant loss of energy. Starting from 3 AM on May 15th, there have been students fainting. The 40 medical staff members of the emergency center have been patrolling the square day and night to treat the fasting students. Many doctors and nurses have been persuading the students to drink glucose saline water with tears in their eyes to prevent damage to the brain and other organs.

Among the students receiving intravenous emergency treatment, 6 have more severe conditions. In addition to low blood pressure or blurred consciousness, there is currently no danger to their lives. The emergency center's responsible person said that as time goes on, the condition of the fainting fasting students will be more severe than in the previous few days. To spare no effort and do everything possible to treat the fasting students, at 3 PM today, the heads of 40 major hospitals in the capital gathered at the Beijing Emergency Center to discuss emergency treatment measures for the fasting students.

In the afternoon, the reporter saw on Tiananmen Square that, in addition to the emergency center, there were also doctors and nurses from Beijing Union Medical College Hospital and more than ten other hospitals volunteering to provide services to the students on the square. The medical staff said, "The students cooperate with us very well, and the ambulances can pass through the square and the surrounding roads without any obstacles."

By 5 PM today, the Beijing Emergency Center had sent a total of 5,000 bottles (bags) of glucose saline water to the square. But the center's responsible person said that if the students continue to fast, they will experience serious physical problems such as arrhythmia and brain damage. What is even more worrying is that there are 11 students among the fasting students who refuse to drink water. The medical staff who persuaded them all cried, but they still refused to drink water. The medical staff sincerely hope that some of the fasting students who refuse to drink water will listen to the advice and definitely accept treatment. At the same time, they hope that the relevant leaders of the Party and the government will have a sincere dialogue with the fasting students.

　　绝食学生晕厥人数剧增  北京医疗单位全力抢救
    本报北京５月１６日讯  记者赖仁琼报道：记者从北京市急救中心获悉，截至今天下午６点，天安门广场绝食学生已有６１７人被送至急救中心和市内协和、同仁、友谊等１９家医院抢救。继续留院观察治疗者有２４７人。
    据急救中心负责人透露，５月１３日首都部分高校学生开始绝食，他们便派出救护车和医护人员去广场。近几日北京昼夜温差大，加之绝食学生只饮清水、情绪激动，体力消耗较大。从５月１５日凌晨３点开始有绝食学生晕厥，急救中心的４０名医护人员在广场日夜为绝食学生巡诊，不少医生护士含着眼泪劝导学生喝葡萄糖盐水，以免造成大脑和各脏器的损害。
    在接受输液抢救的学生中，６人病情较重，除血压偏低或意识模糊外，目前尚无生命危险。急救中心负责人说，越往后，绝食学生晕厥者病情会比前几日更重。为了不惜一切、全力以赴救治绝食学生，今天下午３点首都４０家大医院负责人汇集在北京市急救中心研究绝食学生的抢救措施。
    记者下午在天安门广场看到，除急救中心外，还有北京协和等十几家医院自愿参加救护的医生护士在广场为学生服务。医护人员说：“学生与我们配合得非常好，救护车在广场和沿途畅行无阻。”
    到今天下午５点，北京急救中心共送往广场５０００瓶（袋）葡萄糖盐水。但中心负责人说，如果学生继续绝食，将会出现心律失调、脑损害等严重身体障碍。更令人忧虑的是，绝食学生中有１１名坚决绝水，劝说他们的医护人员全都哭了，但他们仍拒绝饮水。医护人员衷心希望部分拒绝饮水的绝食学生听从劝告，一定接受救治。同时希望党和政府有关领导与绝食学生真诚对话。
