I came to the Qilin Mountain Writers' Retreat in Shenzhen to spend a month writing. Xiaohui said that if a month wasn't enough, I could stay a few more days. I came with an outline for a novella and ten thousand blank pages. My wife had a biography planned, also around ten thousand words. The month ended, and my wife had completed 1/3 of her work, while I was close to turning in a blank page.

I kept wanting to go outside for a walk, to wander in the wild all day. Walking is usually an after-meal or post-work activity to relax the mind and body. But this month, walking became my main activity. I had never been so relaxed and indulgent. I regressed to childhood, becoming a carefree, worry-free child. There were no office politics to trouble me, and no household chores to bother me.

I did reflect on whether I was being lazy. Perhaps a bit. But if I was truly lazy, I had reasons to defend myself and blame external factors. Not wanting to write, just wanting to wander, was the result of the allure of this enchanting environment. In Nanjing, the entire winter was spent huddled in a concrete box. Looking out the window, all I saw were gray tree branches, gray pedestrians, and layer upon layer of gray concrete boxes.

When I left Nanjing, it was the harsh winter of "the ninth month's frost, ducks freeze in the river." The flight took less than two hours, and as soon as I got off the plane, the first thing I did was to remove my heavy winter clothes. A light sweater was enough. My body was liberated, and my mind was clear and refreshed, ready to enjoy the sunshine and sea breeze here.

Between the rolling hills by the sea, there were embedded patches of clear blue lakes. Green trees and vibrant red flowers tightly wrapped around the small building of the Writers' Retreat. There were no villages or towns nearby. No tall buildings pressing on my chest, no narrow alleys squeezing me, no noisy market sounds disturbing my heart. Even the nearest neighbor—the Xili Lake Resort with its sauna and racetrack, heavy with wealth and perfume—was three kilometers away.

A peaceful countryside. The orange groves had just harvested the last batch of honey oranges a few days before the Spring Festival. The lychee trees were in bloom, and the pineapple fields were ripe with fruit.

Along the country roads, the hedges of Osmanthus, Gardenia, and Ixora were in full bloom. The subtle yet rich fragrance of Osmanthus, the sweet and sticky scent of Gardenia, blended into the clear air of the countryside. Looking closely, on a single tree, there were buds, blooming flowers, and mature seeds, three generations together. Flowers bloomed, withered, and bloomed again, in an endless cycle, as if the flowering season would never end.

The drunken Azaleas, deep red and light purple, bloomed densely on long branches. The long branches grew wildly, climbing high trees, scaling white walls, and reaching the rooftops. The drunken flowers, in clusters and bunches, crowded and jostled, laughing and playing, blooming throughout the city streets and the countryside courtyards and riversides. No wonder the Azalea is cherished as Shenzhen's city flower.

Today is what day? It is the morning of the Spring Festival.

In the north and south of the Yellow River, along the banks of the Yangtze River, the seasons are distinct, and the times are clear. Plum blossoms, peach blossoms, sea buckthorn, azaleas, roses, Osmanthus, Gardenia, pomegranates, dahlias, chrysanthemums, camellias, and other flowers bloom in succession according to the twenty-four solar terms. Flowers bloom and fall, following the flower calendar. In Qilin Mountain, Shenzhen, before and after the Spring Festival, all these flowers bloom at the same time. Not in a greenhouse, but in the natural environment outdoors. Time and space are displaced, the god of seasons, and the fairies of flowers, after drinking too much of the Writers' Retreat's Spring Festival liquor, are confused and forget the day, disrupting the seasons and the flower calendar.

I have spent several Spring Festivals in the north and south of the Yellow River and along the banks of the Yangtze River. Those purely folk Spring Festivals often had a festive atmosphere, but there was no sign of spring. The natural world during the Spring Festival was still very harsh, with frost and snow on the ground, bare trees, withered flowers, and dead grass, a festival without spring. The Spring Festival at Qilin Mountain by the South China Sea is a perfect harmony of natural spring and human festival.

The Writers' Retreat is 70 kilometers from the Shenzhen city center, in a very secluded location. A new building is under construction, facing the lake and backed by the mountain. The mountain is named Qilin Mountain, and the lake is named Swan Lake. Although no auspicious Qilin has been found on the mountain, swans occasionally visit the lake.

There are no villages or towns around, lacking the traditional festive atmosphere of the Spring Festival, but adding a sense of tranquility and seclusion. Shenzhen is an open city, but here it is still a closed village. Express mail from Nanjing took eleven days, as if it were delivered by a donkey on a postal route from the last century.

Strolling in the hazy and intoxicating landscape, who cares about the speed of the mail, or the blockage of information. Enduring loneliness seems to be an inevitable fate for writers. Being content with a secluded life and indifferent to the allure of fame and fortune, as a moral principle, is easy to say. But how many truly have this mindset and this life essence?

Of course, this place is not a fantasy paradise separated from the world; it is still a world of beauty and ugliness. Television connects the room with the vast world outside. The ice sculptures in the blizzard of Harbin, the dazzling fashion shows in Paris, the plane crash in England, the threat to Salman Rushdie's life, the street carnivals in Brazil, the floods in India. The man-made ball hanging in the sky hundreds of kilometers high transmits the world's customs and scenes to this quiet countryside house in an instant. Just across the river, the Hong Kong television station constantly displays a mundane, noisy, mixed world of good and bad, true and false.

During the Spring Festival, about a dozen literary friends went to the Shenzhen city center, 70 kilometers away, to stroll. In this new city, there are no Liulichang or Guanqian Street to wander, nor the Qinhuai River or City God Temple to row or stroll. There is no traditional market culture to appreciate, but there are the latest technological products for daily use to choose from.

Shopping in a mall is different from visiting an exhibition. The value of goods is practical, consumable, and possessive. The value of artworks is appreciation, permanence, and sharing. The grand and luxurious mall, with the lonely and quiet wallet, forms a scene of stark contrast. Poor writers shopping in a rich mall seem to have entered a hostile foreign land.

On the morning of the first day of the New Year, children who had just set off firecrackers crouched down in the grass to catch grasshoppers and dug out crickets from the stone cracks. Partridges in the lychee groves cooed to each other, one call and one response. The pond full of duckweed was filled with frogs croaking day and night. The eucalyptus branches echoed with the first chirps of cicadas. At night, mosquitoes buzzed in swarms. These were clearly not scenes of the Spring Festival, but the summer countryside.

The literary friends at Qilin Mountain gradually returned to their respective homes. My wife also went back first. In the end, only I was left in the building. The weather was warmer, the flowers more vibrant, and the environment more tranquil. But the feeling of loneliness grew stronger each day. I am not destined to become an immortal, so I boarded the return flight, still a mortal in the mundane world.

### 春节麒麟山

　　春节麒麟山
    艾煊
    到深圳麒麟山创作之家度假，原意是来写作的，时间一个月。晓慧说，若一个月不够，可以再多住几天。拉开架势，带来了一个中篇的设想，十万字的空白稿纸。妻有一部人物传记，也是十万八万字的计划。一个月结束了，数数页码，妻的工程完成了１／３，我则近于交白卷。
    老是想到室外去散步，想整天在野外游荡。散步，本来是饭后或工余，调剂精神调剂体力的消闲消食活动。但这一个月，却把散步提高到了主业的地位。从来没有这么放松过、放纵过。返老还童，变成了贪玩的幼儿，无忧无虑。既无机关里人事纠纷的劳神，也毋须为家务琐事烦心。
    我也曾自省，是不是太懒了？也许有一点。若确实变懒，我也有袒护自己、苛责客观的理由。不想写，只想游，是这里迷人环境诱惑的结果。在南京，整个冬天都蜷缩在水泥做的方匣子里。抬眼望望窗外，灰色的枯树枝，灰色的行人，还有层层叠叠的灰色水泥方匣子。
    在南京上飞机时，正是“四九中心腊，河里冻死鸭”的严酷冬天。航程不足两小时，一下飞机，第一件事是解除棉衣棉裤的管束，一件轻松的毛衣足矣。身体解放，神清气爽，需要好好享受一下这里的阳光和海风。
    海边连绵起伏的山岭间，嵌入一方方碧蓝透明的小湖。翠绿的树，艳红的花，严严地包裹住创作之家的这幢小楼。附近没有村庄，没有市镇。没有压在胸口的高楼，没有挤扁人的狭巷，没有搅扰人心烦意乱的嘈杂市声。就连最靠近的邻居——那个有桑拿浴，有跑马场，富贵气、脂粉气太重的西丽湖度假村，——也在三公里外。
    一片宁静的乡野。柑桔林里，春节前两天刚采完最后一批蜜桔。荔枝林里花正开，菠萝田里果正熟。
    乡间道路两边，作为篱障的米兰、含笑、扶桑，繁花满树。米兰又素淡又浓郁的清香，含笑蜜糖似的腻香，融和在乡野明净的空气中。仔细看看，一树之上，饱孕的花蕾、正开的鲜花、成熟的种子，三代同堂。花，开了谢，谢了开，循还往复，花期似永无尽时。
    醉态的簕杜鹃，深红浅紫，花，一朵靠一朵，密密麻麻地着生在长枝条上。长枝条，狂放地疯长，爬上高树，攀上粉墙，窜上楼顶。醉意朦胧的花，一串串，一团团，一堆堆，拥拥挤挤，笑笑闹闹，开遍了市区的街巷，开遍了乡间的庭院、河旁。难怪簕杜鹃被珍视为深圳的市花。
    今日何日？正春节元旦之晨。
    黄河南北，长江两岸，节令有度，时序分明。迎春、夭桃、海棠、杜鹃、玫瑰、米兰、含笑、石榴、大丽、丹桂、黄菊、山茶，按四时二十四节陆续开放。花开花落，不违花信。在深圳麒麟山，春节前后，这些花全都同时开放。不是在人工的温房里，是在野外的大自然环境中。时空易位，季节之神，百花之仙，多吃了几杯创作之家的春节五粮液，迷迷糊糊，恍恍惚惚，竟忘却今日何日，乱了节令，乱了花信风。
    我在长江两岸、黄河南北，度过了几个春节。那些纯民俗意义的春节，往往有节日的气氛，但尚无春的信息。春节中的自然界，还是极其严酷，霜雪满地，万木萧疏，花灭草枯，有节无春。南海边麒麟山的春节，则是自然界的春和人间节日的完美统一。
    创作之家离深圳市区７０华里，地极幽静。正在建造的一幢新楼，背山面湖。山名麒麟山，湖名天鹅湖。山上虽未发现祥瑞的麒麟，湖中到偶有天鹅光临。
    四周无村无镇，少了点传统春节的热闹气氛，多了点宁静清寂。深圳是开放的城市，这里还是封闭的农村。南京寄来的快递信件，竟走了十一天，似乎是上个世纪驿站毛驴传递的。
    漫步在迷离醉人的天地山川之间，又何忧邮件快慢，更毋须管它信息灵塞。耐得住寂寞，似乎是作家无可逃脱的命运。甘于清寂的生活，淡于名利的诱惑，作为道德信条讲讲，那是极容易的。几人真的有此心态，有此生活本色？
    当然这里决非离世的幻乡仙境，它仍是美丑混杂的俗尘浊世。电视沟通了斗室与万里外广大世界的联系。哈尔滨漫天风雪中的冰雕，巴黎眼花缭乱的时装表演，英格兰的飞机坠毁，拉什迪生命遭受威胁，巴西纵情纵性的街头狂欢，印度的洪水泛滥。悬挂在几百公里高空中的那个人造小球，把同一时间发生的那些世态风情，眨眼间传到了这个冷清的乡野小楼里。仅仅一河之隔的香港电视台，整天向这里展示出一个平庸、喧闹，清浊交混，真假并见的世界。
    春节中，十来位文学友人结伴去７０里外的深圳市区逛街。新兴城市，既没有琉璃厂、观前街可以溜达，也没有秦淮河、城隍庙可以荡桨或漫步。没有传统的市井文化可以游目鉴赏，有的是最新科技成果的日用品任君选购。
    逛商场与逛展览会心态不同。商品的价值，是实用，是消耗，是占有。艺术品的价值，是欣赏，是永存，是共有。金碧辉煌的商场，与冷清寂寞的钱袋，构成了色调对比鲜明的图景。穷作家逛富商场，似乎误入了充满敌意的异国他邦。
    初一的早晨，放过爆仗的孩子，又俯身到草丛中捉蚱蜢，石缝里掏蛐蛐。鹁鸪在荔枝林里咕咕求偶，一声唤，一声应。飘满青萍的池塘里，一群群青蛙昼夜高声鼓噪。桉树枝头响彻知了的初鸣。夜间，蚊子嗡嗡成阵。这些，又分明不是春节，而是初夏乡景。
    麒麟山的文友们，陆陆续续返回各自的故地。妻也先回家了。一幢楼最后只剩了我一个住客。天更暖，花更艳，环境更加宁静。但寂寞感也日重一日。我是无缘成仙的，只好登上归程飞机，仍做浊世俗人。
