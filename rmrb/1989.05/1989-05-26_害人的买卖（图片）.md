These fertilizer bags are being collected and sold openly in the market by some individuals. According to the epidemic prevention station, these bags can only be used to package soil and coal, and have no other uses. However, it is seen that some people buy them to use as "multi-purpose" packaging bags, such as for packaging grain, which is quite harmful. How to prevent fertilizer bags from entering the market, relevant departments should pay attention to this issue.

    害人的买卖
    这些农用化肥包装袋，竟被有心者收来摆在市上公开出卖。据防疫站的人说，此类包装袋仅能用于包装泥土，煤炭，别无其它用途，可是偶见有人买去当“多功能”包装袋，用来装粮食什么的，害人不浅。如何杜绝化肥包装袋流入市场，有关部门应引起重视。
