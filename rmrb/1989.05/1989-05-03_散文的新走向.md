Title: The New Direction of Essay Writing

Over the past ten years, essay writing and miscellaneous writing have made significant progress, particularly miscellaneous writing, which has clearly surpassed the general level of the 1930s. The first national essay and miscellaneous writing awards and research conference held by the China Writers Association is a great encouragement to writers and enthusiasts of this genre.

However, a major contradiction has emerged: due to the unprecedented difficulties in the publishing industry, the opportunities for essays and miscellaneous writings to be published in collections are currently almost zero.

The most fundamental issue is to help essays and miscellaneous writings break out of their narrow confines, expand their influence, and take deeper root among readers, growing more vigorously. The May Fourth Movement has been around for seventy years, and new literature has always revolved around the intellectual class and literature enthusiasts. The readership of Lu Xun's novels is far less than that of Zhang Henshui, which is a clear example. The readership of essays and miscellaneous writings is even smaller than that of novels, which is an undeniable fact. This situation must be broken through.

Is it that the genre of essays and miscellaneous writings is particularly unappealing? It seems that we cannot draw this conclusion. Evidence one: essays have always been the most popular genre in traditional Chinese literature, with a long history. Evidence two: Lu Xun's miscellaneous writings have had a profound and far-reaching influence, and Liang Qichao's essay collection "Yashe Xiaopin" has been widely read in Taiwan for forty years and has been reprinted dozens of times; Long Yutai's critical collection caused a sensation and sparked a whirlwind across the straits. Evidence three: the tradition of newspaper supplements in China, especially the past leisurely small newspapers, and the numerous and varied supplements in Hong Kong newspapers, can almost be said to be a world of essays and miscellaneous writings (including random notes, small essays, etc.), becoming the daily spiritual sustenance for ordinary readers and people from all walks of life.

However, our essay writing has almost become a "study literature" of self-admiration; miscellaneous writings are relatively close to society, but the readership circle is similarly narrow. Writers should be able to endure loneliness, especially in an era that openly calls for the commercialization of literature and the commercialization of writers. But the results of a writer's hard work are often reduced to a lonely monologue, unnoticed and unheard, which is another kind of embarrassing loneliness. Any genuine literary work comes from the depths of the heart, but once it becomes a work, it cannot help but be concerned with external reactions. It is unimaginable that a writer would not write for readers; on the contrary, a writer should not be satisfied with a few literary friends, but should seek a wide readership and broad resonance.

Essays must break free from self-enclosed psychology, walk onto the streets, and share joys and sorrows with the masses, breathing together, and strive to open up a broad channel for the heart.

We must abandon all narrow-minded interests such as self-righteousness, self-indulgence, self-pity, and self-imprisonment, and move towards a world of freedom, vitality, endless change, unrestricted format, and colorful diversity.

We must say goodbye to obscurity, hypocrisy, dullness, and foreign affectations and pretentiousness; we must make our writing have the strongest expressive and attractive power, transparent yet implicit, and able to withstand chewing.

We must have a critical spirit and also be able to nurture the soul, to soothe the mind and delight the senses, because this is a need of life and social progress. We must put down the pretentious attitude of writers with tall hats and wide sleeves, try to avoid flattering low tastes, and beware of self-destruction.

The long-standing concepts of essays and miscellaneous writings have become outdated and should quickly enter the era of reform and updating of concepts!

　　散文的新走向
    柯灵
    十年来，散文和杂文有了长足的进步，尤其是杂文，明显地超越三十年代的一般水平。中国作协首届全国散文、杂文评奖和研讨会的举行，是对这一文体的写作者和爱好者雪中送炭，一种极大的鼓舞。
    但同时出现了一个极大的矛盾：由于出版事业陷入空前的困境，散文和杂文结集出版的机会，目前几等于零。
    最根本的问题，是使散文和杂文走出狭巷，扩大自己的影响，在读者中更深地扎根，更枝荣叶茂地滋长。五四运动七十年了，新文学始终回旋在知识阶层和文学爱好者中间。鲁迅小说的读者远不如张恨水的多，就是明证。散文和杂文比小说的读者更少，是个确定不移的事实。这种局面必须突破。
    是不是散文和杂文这种文体特别不惹人喜欢？看来不能下这个结论。证据之一，散文历来是中国传统中最流行的文体，源远流长。证据之二，鲁迅的杂文影响巨大深远，梁实秋的散文《雅舍小品》，在台湾这一海岛上，四十年来脍炙人口，已重版数十次；龙应台的批评集轰动一时，掀起席卷海内外的龙卷风。证据之三，中国报纸副刊的传统，特别是过去消闲性的小报，香港报纸盈篇累牍、各色各样的副刊，更可以说是清一色的散文和杂文的世界（包括随笔、小品等等），成为一般读者、三教九流的日常精神食粮。
    而我们的散文创作，几乎成了孤芳自赏的“书斋文学”；杂文较为贴近社会，但读者的圈子同样狭小。作家应当耐得住寂寞，特别是在公开呼唤文学商品化、作家商人化的时代。但作家辛苦经营的结果，竟成为咄咄书空的独白，无声无息，却是另一种令人难堪的寂寞。任何纯正的文学作品，都发自个人的深心，但一旦成为作品，却不能不关心外界的反应。不能设想，作家不为读者而写作；恰好相反，作家不应当满足于少数的文字知己，应当追求众多的读者，广泛的共鸣。
    散文必须打破自我封闭的心理，走向十字街头，和广大的读者共忧乐、共休戚、共呼吸，努力开辟一条宽阔的心灵通道。
    必须抛弃一切自恃清高、自我陶醉、自作多情、顾影自怜、作茧自缚的狭隘趣味，走向自由活泼、生气洋溢、千变万化、不拘一格、多姿多彩的天地。
    要向晦涩告别，向虚伪告别，向枯燥无味告别，向洋腔怪调、扭捏作态告别；要使笔墨有最强大的表现力和吸引力，既透明，又含蓄，经得起咀嚼。
    要有批评精神，也要能陶冶心灵，能怡情悦性，因为这是生活的需要，社会进步的需要。把峨冠博带的作家架子放下来，要尽力避免媚悦低级趣味，谨防自趋堕落。
    长期形成的散文、杂文观念老化了，应该迅速进入改造和观念更新的时代！
