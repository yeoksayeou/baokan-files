Sihanouk Arrives in Jakarta for Talks with Hun Sen
Reaffirms Vietnam Must Withdraw from Cambodia Under International Supervision

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 30 (Reporter Li Yongming) Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), stated today in Jakarta that the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime can be dissolved without using the word "dissolution" to seek a solution to end the Cambodian people's more than ten years of suffering.

Prince Sihanouk arrived in Jakarta this afternoon and will hold talks with Hun Sen, the leader of the Phnom Penh regime, on May 2 and 3.

At a press conference held at Jakarta International Airport, Prince Sihanouk said that Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia must be under international supervision.

He said that to reach a solution and achieve independence and peace for Cambodia, he has made concessions on two issues under the premise of unchanged principles: Vietnam does not agree to maintain peacekeeping forces, and he will not discuss this matter in the talks; Vietnam advocates the establishment of an "international supervisory body," while he proposes the establishment of an "international supervisory committee."

Prince Sihanouk said, "The name is not important; what matters is the substance."

Prince Sihanouk said that if Vietnam does not agree to have the United Nations mediate, an international conference can be held in Paris to seek a solution. Even if no agreement can be reached on the issue of maintaining peacekeeping forces, at least an agreement can be reached on the international supervisory body.

Prince Sihanouk said that the three factions of the CGDK recently held a meeting in Bangkok and unanimously agreed to send Son Sann, Prime Minister of the CGDK, to Jakarta to negotiate with Hun Sen.

According to reports, Prince Sihanouk proposed today that after his meeting with Hun Sen in Jakarta, a four-party meeting on Cambodia should be held immediately in Bangkok.

　　西哈努克抵雅加达将同洪森会谈    
    重申越南必须在国际监督下从柬撤军
    据新华社雅加达４月３０日电  （记者李永明）民柬主席西哈努克亲王今天在这里说，由越南扶植起来的金边政权可以在不提“解散”两字的情况下解散，以便为结束柬埔寨人民１０多年的苦难而寻求一项解决方案。
    西哈努克亲王今天下午抵达雅加达，准备５月２日和３日在此间同金边政权领导人洪森举行会谈。
    在雅加达国际机场举行的记者招待会上，西哈努克亲王说，越南从柬埔寨撤军必须要有国际监督。
    他说，为了达成一项解决方案，为了柬埔寨的独立与和平，在原则不变的前提下，他在两个问题上做出了让步，即越南不同意维持和平部队，他将不在会谈中讨论此事；越南主张建立“国际监督机构”，而他提议建立“国际监督委员会”。
    西哈努克亲王说，“名称并不重要，重要的是实质”。
    西哈努克亲王说，如果越南不同意由联合国来调解，可以在巴黎召开一个国际会议来寻求解决方案，即使不能在维持和平部队问题上达成协议，至少也可在国际监督机构方面达成协议。
    西哈努克亲王说，民柬三方最近在曼谷举行会议，一致同意派民柬联合政府总理宋双到雅加达来同洪森谈判。
    据报道，西哈努克亲王今天提出建议，在他同洪森于雅加达会晤后，立即在曼谷举行柬埔寨四方会议。
