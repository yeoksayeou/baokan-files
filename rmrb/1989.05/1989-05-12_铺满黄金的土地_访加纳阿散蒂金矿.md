The Land Covered with Gold
– Visiting the Ashanti Gold Mine in Ghana
People's Daily reporter, Xu Dewen

Some people refer to Ghana as the "land covered with gold," which is of course an exaggeration. But when the reporter concluded his visit to Ghana, he felt that Ghana was indeed a country "filled with gold." No wonder the Portuguese colonizers once called it the "Gold Coast."

In Ghana's 239,000 square kilometers of territory, the gold mining area covers approximately 55,000 square kilometers. According to Ghana's geological research department, Ghana possesses 2 billion ounces of gold reserves (1 ounce = 31.1 grams). If we calculate based on an annual extraction of 2.7 million ounces, it can be mined for 740 years. Ghana's gold mines have many advantages: first, high grade, with an average of 0.5 ounces of gold per ton of ore, while the average for other gold-producing countries is less than 0.25 ounces; second, high purity, with Ghana's gold containing 90-95% pure gold, generally only 80%; third, shallow layers, with most of Ghana's mines being about 600 meters deep, the deepest only around 1,500 meters, while mines in other countries are generally over 1,000 meters deep, with the deepest reaching 4,000 meters; fourth, easy to mine, with Ghana's gold mining using the simple method of crushing ore and gravity separation, without the need for cyanide treatment to decompose micro-gold particles from the ore.

Due to the aforementioned advantages of Ghana's gold resources, they have historically attracted long-term competition from colonizers. In 1897, after Ghana became a British colony, the British established the world-renowned Ashanti Gold Mine Company there.

After Ghana's independence, the government announced in 1962 that it would take over three gold mines and establish the State Gold Mine Company. In 1972, it implemented joint management of the Ashanti Gold Mine Company, with the Ghanaian government holding 55% of the shares and the British side holding 45%. The gold produced belonged to the government, but the company was allowed to retain 45% of its foreign exchange earnings. In 1983, the Ghanaian government proposed a plan to revitalize the gold mines, actively taking measures to attract foreign investment, update equipment, and introduce technology, leading to a new gold production boom in Ghana. From then on, the gold produced in Ghana truly began to benefit the people.

With the assistance of Ghana's Ministry of Information, we visited the Ashanti Gold Mine. Upon arriving at the company, the head of the Public Relations Department warmly received us, and George and a secretary accompanied us on the tour. When we went down into the mine, everyone changed into mining clothes, put on safety helmets and mining lamps, and took the steel cable elevator down for about 5 minutes to reach a depth of approximately 540 meters. We then walked about 300 meters to a junction of the mine shafts. Here, miners were transporting ore. Under the light of the mining lamps, we could see that the surrounding black rocks had spots of shine, and we thought this must be gold. A miner laughed and told us that these shiny rocks did not contain gold. He pointed to the white rock veins in the middle of the roof, about two feet wide, saying that gold was hidden here! Another miner, guessing our thoughts, led us through a narrow shaft opening, climbed up a small wooden ladder, and reached the working face. His gaze swept over the rock layers, and he quickly called out to us, "Look, this is gold!" Following the direction of his finger, we saw small clusters of gold grains shining on the white rock veins. A Ghanaian friend held up a piece of gold ore and told us, "This mine is one of the mines with the highest gold content in the world. One ton of ore can refine one ounce of gold, while ordinary gold ore requires several tons to extract one ounce of gold." His pride was evident.

"The Ashanti Gold Mine Company is the leading enterprise in Ghana, with 12,000 employees. People across the country envy us for being able to work here," George said proudly. But he also frankly told us that a few years ago, due to insufficient funds, outdated equipment, and backward technology, the production situation was not good. After the government implemented the economic recovery plan, the company borrowed 80 million dollars from the government, and the World Bank and Western European banks provided loans of 50 million and 30 million dollars respectively. With this funding, production conditions improved year by year. In 1987, 275,000 ounces of gold were produced, and in 1988, this increased to 305,000 ounces, the highest profit in the company's 90-plus years of operation.

During the tour of the mining area, the reporter saw that new mines had been drilled, abandoned mines had been repaired, open-pit mines had been put into production, and nearby piles of tailings that had been dormant for decades were now being processed with new technology to extract gold grains... The Ashanti Gold Mine indeed showed signs of vigorous life...

Of course, mining underground is still hard work. When we arrived at the mine entrance, a shift of miners happened to be coming up from the mine. But the reporter did not see a single worker looking tired; instead, everyone was full of energy and laughing. George said that the workers here all love their jobs. The reason is simple: first, the wages are high, the benefits are good, and there are various rewards, as well as a comfortable living and entertainment environment; second, the gold mine creates 25% of the country's foreign exchange earnings each year, and the workers have a sense of pride in contributing to the country.

The Ashanti Gold Mine has not let down the workers' enthusiasm. To ensure that they have no worries, the company does all the logistical work, and workers do not need to leave the mine's gates to buy various daily necessities. The gold mine also operates agriculture, livestock, and fisheries, selling chickens, ducks, fish, pork, eggs, etc., to workers at only 50% of the market price. Workers' children can attend the company's primary and secondary schools for free and receive meals, and children attending university can also receive subsidies from the mine. The gold mine is building over 3,000 houses for workers, some of which have already been completed. Row upon row of neat and tidy houses with light red, beige, or sky-blue walls. George said that the company provides housing for workers for free. The allocation principle is that those with ability and skills live in better houses.

The mine also built a cinema, tennis court, football field, youth and senior clubs, restaurants, bars, and other rest and entertainment facilities for workers in a beautiful environment. We watched a football match with the miners on the platform of the club. Every time there was an exciting moment, cheers echoed around us, and we were deeply moved. After the visit, we saw their achievements and understood why the people of the Ashanti Gold Mine were so proud.

　　铺满黄金的土地   
    ——访加纳阿散蒂金矿
    本报记者  徐德文
    有人把加纳称为“铺满黄金的土地”，这种说法当然过于夸张。但当记者结束在加纳的采访时，却又觉得加纳确像一个“遍地金子”的国家。怪不得过去葡萄牙殖民者把它称为“黄金海岸”。
    在加纳２３．９万多平方公里国土上，金矿带的面积约为５．５万平方公里。据加纳地质研究部门宣布：加纳拥有２０亿盎司（１盎司＝３１．１克）黄金储量。如以每年开采２７０万盎司计算，可供开采７４０年。加纳的金矿具有很多优点：一、品位高，平均每吨金矿石含金约０．５盎司，而一般产金国的矿石不到０．２５盎司；二、纯度高，加纳黄金含纯金９０—９５％，一般只含８０％；三、埋层浅，加纳的矿井多数为６００米深，最深的只有１５００米左右，而其它国家的矿井一般为１０００多米，最深的达４０００米；四、容易开采，加纳黄金的开采使用粉碎矿石后加重力分离的简单办法，不需用氰化物处理法从矿石中分解微金粒。
    由于加纳黄金资源的上述优势，历史上曾引起殖民者的长期角逐。１８９７年，加纳沦为英国殖民地后，英国在那里建立了名闻世界的阿散蒂金矿公司。
    加纳独立后，政府于１９６２年宣布接管３个金矿，成立了国家金矿公司。１９７２年，对阿散蒂金矿公司实行合资经营，加纳政府入股５５％，英方占股份４５％，出产的黄金归政府所有，但允许公司将其外汇收入的４５％作为留成。１９８３年，加纳政府提出一项复兴金矿的计划，积极采取吸收外资、更新设备、引进技术等措施，使加纳出现了新的黄金生产高潮。从此，加纳出产的黄金才真正能为人民造福。
    在加纳新闻部协助下，我们采访了阿散蒂金矿。一到公司，公共关系部的负责人热情地接待了我们，并由乔治先生和秘书小姐陪同我们进行参观。下矿井参观时，大家换上矿工服、戴上安全帽和矿灯，乘钢缆吊车运行５分钟后，下到深约５４０米的井下坑道，往里走了约３００米，来到一个坑道交汇处。在这里，矿工们正在运输矿石。借着矿灯的光亮，可以看到周围黑色的岩石上点点闪光，我们满以为这就是黄金。一位矿工笑着告诉我们，这闪光的岩石中并没有黄金。他指着坑顶中间宽约两英尺的一条条白色岩带说，这里才蕴藏有黄金哩！另一位矿工猜到我们的心思，带领我们通过一道狭小的坑口，爬上一把小木梯，登上工作面。他的目光扫过岩层，迅即招呼我们：“看，这就是金子！”随着他的手指所向，我们在一条条白色的岩带上看到，一小簇、一小簇金粒在闪耀金光。一位加纳朋友手捧一块金矿石告诉我们：“这口矿井是世界上含金量最高的矿井之一，１吨矿石可提炼出一盎司黄金，而一般的金矿石得用好几吨才能选出一盎司黄金。”他那自豪之情，溢于言表。
    “阿散蒂金矿公司是加纳全国首屈一指的企业，有１．２万职工，全国人民都非常羡慕我们能在这儿工作。”乔治先生也以自豪的口吻对我们说。但他也坦率地告诉我们，前几年由于资金不足、设备陈旧、技术落后，生产形势不佳。政府实行经济恢复计划后，公司向政府贷款８０００万美元，世界银行和西欧银行也分别提供贷款５０００万和３０００万美元。有了这笔资金，提高了现代化程度，生产形势一年比一年好。１９８７年生产黄金２７．５万盎司，１９８８年增加到３０．５万盎司，是公司成立９０多年来获利最高的。
    在矿区各处参观时，记者看到新井已开钻，废井已修复，露天金矿已投产，不远处堆积如山的沉睡了几十年的废矿石渣，由于采用新技术，从中又提炼出颗颗金沙……阿散蒂金矿确实呈现出勃勃生机……
    在井下采金，当然还是辛苦的。我们到达矿井口时，恰逢一批矿工换班从井下上来。但记者没有看到一个工人无精打采的样子，而是一个个生龙活虎、谈笑甚欢。乔治先生说，这里的工人都热爱自己的工作。原因很简单：一是工资高、福利好、各种奖励多，还有一个舒适良好的生活、娱乐环境；二是金矿每年为国家创造的外汇占全国外汇总收入的２５％，工人都有一种为国家作出贡献的荣誉感。
    阿散蒂金矿确实没有辜负职工的工作热情，为使他们无后顾之忧，公司做好一切后勤工作，职工不出矿区大门就能买到各种生活用品。金矿还自己经营农、牧、渔业，生产出来的鸡、鸭、鱼、猪肉、蛋等，仅以市场价的５０％卖给职工。职工子女可在矿办的中、小学免费上学和供给伙食，上大学的子女也可得到矿上的补助。金矿正在为职工增建３０００多套住房，有的已经落成。一座座浅红、米黄或天蓝色外墙的平房整洁美观。乔治先生说，公司免费为职工提供住房。分配的原则是，有能力、有技术的住好房。
    矿上还为职工在环境优美的地方修建了电影院、网球场、足球场、青、老年俱乐部、餐厅、酒巴等休息、娱乐场所。我们和矿工们一起，在俱乐部的平台上欣赏正在进行的足球赛。每到精采之处，四周欢声回荡，我们也深受感染。结束采访后，我们看到了他们的成就，理解了阿散蒂金矿的人们为什么充满自豪感。　（附图片）
