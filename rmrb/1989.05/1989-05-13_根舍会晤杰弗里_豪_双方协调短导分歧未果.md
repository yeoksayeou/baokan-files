	Hans-Dietrich Genscher Meets Geoffrey Howe
	No Progress Made in Coordinating Short-Range Missile Disputes

	Our reporter Chen Te'an reports from London: Federal Republic of Germany Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher arrived in London yesterday to meet with British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe, aiming to coordinate their positions on the short-range missile issue.

	According to reports, neither side was willing to disclose details of the talks, and "there were no signs of progress in resolving the disputes over short-range missiles." Currently, the UK and the US advocate for the modernization of the Lance short-range missiles deployed in Western Europe, opposing negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles in Europe until the Soviet Union makes necessary concessions on conventional weapons, chemical weapons, and short-range nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, the Federal Republic of Germany believes that there is no immediate need to modernize Western Europe's short-range missiles and urges NATO to accept the Warsaw Pact countries' proposal for early negotiations on the reduction of short-range missiles in Europe.

	It is believed that Howe and Genscher failed to reach a consensus on the short-range missile issue, which is related to their differing interpretations of a section of the NATO ministerial meeting communiqué issued in Reykjavik in June 1987. The communiqué stated that the Western alliance "is willing to link the establishment of a balance of conventional weapons, the global elimination of chemical weapons, and the verifiable reduction of U.S.-Soviet land-based short-range nuclear weapons systems, leading to an equal ceiling for both sides."

	The Bonn side believes that the phrase "linking" in the communiqué means that negotiations between superpowers to reduce short-range missiles should be conducted in parallel with the ongoing negotiations on the reduction of conventional weapons in Europe in Vienna and the prohibition of chemical weapons in Geneva. West Germany emphasizes that negotiations on short-range missiles should "begin as soon as possible."

	London and Washington, however, believe that the word "establishment" means that such negotiations on short-range missiles can only begin after successful negotiations on conventional weapons and chemical weapons.

　　根舍会晤杰弗里·豪
    双方协调短导分歧未果
    本报伦敦５月１２日电  记者陈特安报道：联邦德国外长根舍昨天抵达伦敦会晤英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪，协调彼此在短导问题上的立场。
    据报道，双方会谈后均不愿透露会谈细节，“没有迹象表明在消除短导问题上分歧取得进展”。目前，英、美主张使部署在西欧的长矛式短导现代化，反对在苏联就常规武器、化学武器和短程核武器作出必要的让步之前同苏联谈判在欧洲的短导问题。而联邦德国认为，目前尚无使西欧短导现代化的必要，并呼吁北约尽早接受华约国家就削减欧洲短导问题进行谈判的建议。
    据认为，豪与根舍未能就短导问题取得一致，这与他们对１９８７年６月雷克雅未克北约部长会议公报一段文字的解释不同有关。公报说，西方联盟“愿把常规武器平衡的建立、全球性消除化学武器以及可核查的美苏陆基短程核武器系统的削减联系起来，从而导致双方有一个相同的最高限额”。
    波恩方面认为，这段公报中的“同…联系”意思是说，超级大国之间削减短导的谈判，同目前正在维也纳举行的削减在欧洲的常规军备以及在日内瓦举行的禁止化学武器谈判应该是并行的。西德强调，短导谈判应“及早进行”。
    伦敦和华盛顿则认为，“建立”这个词意味着短导这类谈判仅仅是在常规武器谈判和化学武器谈判取得成功之后才能开始。
