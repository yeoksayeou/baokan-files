Strange Incident: 70,000 Yuan Worth of Goods Lost, Unclaimed for 5 Months

In the southern part of Anhui Province, in Guangde County, a strange incident occurred: three boxes of imported goods were lost on a public road and were found by someone five months ago, but to this day, no one has come to claim them.

These three boxes of imported goods were found by the driver Hu Hai Shou and the mechanic Lu Fu Bing of the Langxi County Transport Company last November. The transport company immediately posted a notice on the main roads to reclaim the goods and later published a notice and news in the "Anhui Transportation News" and "Huadongnan News."

The batch of imported goods includes more than 300 boxes of Japanese-made electronic game program cards and more than 10 boxes of imported carpet samples, with a total value of more than 70,000 yuan.

　　怪事：７万元商品丢失  ５个月无人认领
    新华社合肥５月１３日电  皖南广德县境内发生一桩怪事：三箱进口商品遗失在公路上，被人捡到５个月，至今仍无人认领。
    这三箱进口商品是去年１１月被郎溪县搬运公司驾驶员胡海寿和修理工吕福兵捡到的。这家搬运公司随即在交通要道张贴招领启事，后又在《安徽交通报》、《皖东南报》上刊登了招领启事和消息。
    这批进口商品包括３００多盒日本产电子游戏机程序卡，１０余盒进口地毯标本等，总价值７万多元。
