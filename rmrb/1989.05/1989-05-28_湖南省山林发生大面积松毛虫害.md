Large-scale Pine Caterpillar Infestation in Hunan Province's Forests

Reported by our reporter Dú Ruòyuán from Changsha on May 27: Hunan Province's extensive forests are suffering from a severe pine caterpillar infestation, affecting 12 cities and prefectures. Areas such as Changsha, Shaoyang, and Chengzhou have almost every county experiencing the pest problem.

This year is a major outbreak year for pine caterpillars. According to statistics from Hunan Province's forest pest control experts, the total area affected by the infestation will reach 8 million mu (approximately 533,333 hectares).

The situation is particularly severe in counties and cities like Pingjiang, Ningxiang, and Miluo, where vast pine forests have had their leaves eaten away by the caterpillars, presenting a desolate and yellowed scene. In the suburbs of Xiangtan City, pine caterpillars have invaded several villages' ponds, fields, and roads, and are even crawling into farmers' homes in groups.
