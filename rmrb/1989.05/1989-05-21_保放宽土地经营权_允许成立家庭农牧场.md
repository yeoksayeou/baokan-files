Bulgaria has decided to further relax land management rights, allowing the establishment of family farms and individual farms.

This new measure to advance agricultural reform was proposed in Bulgaria's new "Land Use Law" issued by the government today.

The new land law stipulates that the basic organizational form of agricultural production activities in Bulgaria is the collective farm. Collective farms should be agricultural economic organizations that are fully self-managed and voluntarily participated in by agricultural workers. The agricultural production activities of collective farms or family farms can be realized through any agricultural company, not necessarily the company in their locality.

Bulgarian economic experts pointed out that the new land law specifies the concrete rights and obligations of various forms of land managers. The purpose is to further deepen agricultural reform, solve various fundamental issues related to agricultural production activities on the basis of the principle of corporatization, and according to the special conditions of the agricultural sector, concretely implement the principle of separating ownership and management rights, and diversify agricultural production forms.

　　保放宽土地经营权
    允许成立家庭农牧场
    新华社索非亚５月２０日电  保加利亚决定进一步放宽土地经营权，允许成立家庭农牧场和个人农牧场。
    这一推进农业改革的新措施是保加利亚政府今天颁布的新的《土地使用法》提出的。
    新土地法规定，保加利亚农业生产活动的基本组织形式是集体农业社。集体农业社要办成农业劳动者自觉、自愿参加的完全实行自治管理的农业经济组织。集体农业社或家庭农牧场的农业经营活动可以通过任何一个农业公司来兑现，不一定是其所在地方的公司。
    保经济界人士指出，新的土地法规定各种形式的土地经营者的具体权力和义务，目的在于进一步加深农业改革，在公司化原则的基础上根据农业部门的特殊条件，解决同农业生产活动有关的各种基本问题，具体落实所有权和经营权分离的原则，使农业生产形式多样化。
