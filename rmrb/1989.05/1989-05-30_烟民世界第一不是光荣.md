Since last year, China has also conducted extensive publicity on the hazards of smoking around World No-Tobacco Day. Some production workshops, offices, and wards have implemented relatively strict no-smoking regulations, but the overall situation is not optimistic. China is not only the world's largest producer of cigarettes but also has the highest number of smokers. However, this first place is not a source of pride but a mark of shame. We are a country with an imperfect legal system. The issue of smoking infringing on others' legitimate rights and endangering national property safety has not been formally discussed as a legal issue, although some members of the National People's Congress have raised this problem.

In terms of publicity, we should first comprehensively and substantively discuss the various hazards of tobacco production and smoking. For example, tobacco cultivation occupies arable land that is already scarce, competing with grain, cotton, and oil; tobacco curing consumes a large amount of firewood; tobacco production is profitable, thereby hindering the arrangement of other productions; statistical data and mechanisms of smoking-induced diseases; social conflicts and infringements on others' rights caused by smoking; environmental pollution and frequent fires caused by smoking; the conflict between smoking and modern high-tech production; the economic accounts of smoking and the gains and losses for individuals and the country; the fact and survey data that smoking and juvenile delinquency are synchronized, etc.

Secondly, we should scientifically analyze and judge the psychology and sophistry of smokers, so that they can bravely admit that smoking not only has various hazards but is also an uncivilized behavior.

For films, television, photography exhibitions, and other media, we should seriously clean up and avoid shooting scenes of positive characters smoking, such as public security officers relying on one cigarette after another to think in front of a major case; some writers also have a few cigarette butts for an article, attributing inspiration to the stimulation of nicotine, which is unreasonable.

In terms of social norms and laws, we must first affirm that smoking is a major social harm, so as to gradually promote smoking cessation activities.

We might as well formulate a national smoking cessation plan for the next few years, considering the transformation process of the majority of smokers, as well as giving tobacco farmers, tobacco factories, and tobacco companies time to transform and adjust, which can be set for five or ten years.

We should strictly limit the import and sale of foreign cigarettes and impose heavy penalties on illegal smugglers.

We should strictly regulate which occupations, ages, places, and times are not allowed to smoke, and deal with them accordingly. For example, forests, grasslands, warehouses, cultural relics, hospitals, kindergartens, most laboratories, schools, state organs, battlefields, various means of transportation, canteens, and most factories... absolutely prohibit smoking, and punish violators.

In the presence of non-smokers or those under 20 years old, smoking is also not allowed, otherwise, it should be treated as an infringement of others' rights.

In terms of time, the first year implements the International No-Tobacco Day, the second year implements the No-Tobacco Day (the seventh day of each month), the third year implements the No-Tobacco Week (the week of the No-Tobacco Day), the fourth year implements the No-Tobacco Month... During this period, smokers will be punished.

In addition to occupational smoking cessation, we should establish non-smoking groups and non-smoking areas, but they should not be false, formalistic, or just to appease superiors. Because some occupations (such as doctors, cooks, food and drug producers...) and some industries (such as high-tech industries) need to quit smoking is obvious, but if a certain social environment is not created, the exemplary behavior of those who first advocate smoking cessation often becomes the content of others' attacks and ridicule, and these people also become the only ones in the group. In the end, it is either peaceful coexistence or being assimilated and losing all previous efforts.

In the parties mainly composed of the medical and scientific and technological communities, if they can take the lead in becoming non-smoking groups, it will also be refreshing, showing that their words and deeds are consistent, giving people a sense of reliability.

We should establish a new trend of honoring non-smoking and eliminate the misconception that changing from pipe tobacco to cigarettes and domestic tobacco to foreign tobacco is modernization and fashion.

In short, as Marx said, one practical action is better than a dozen plans. We need to start from legislation, supplemented by publicity and other measures, to gradually and resolutely quit smoking!

### 烟民世界第一不是光荣

    烟民世界第一不是光荣
    北京医科大学公共卫生学院  杜明达  杨芳
    从去年开始，我国也在世界戒烟日前后对吸纸烟的危害作了不少宣传，个别的生产车间、办公室、病房实行了比较严格的禁止吸烟规定，但总的情况叫人并不乐观。中国不但在纸烟生产上，而且在吸烟人数上都是世界第一。但这个第一并非光荣，而是耻辱的标志。我们是个法制不健全的国家，吸烟在侵犯他人正当权利、危害国家财产安全等方面的问题，还不曾做为一个法律问题正式讨论过，虽然部分全国人大代表曾提出过这个问题。
    在宣传上，首先应把生产烟与吸烟的各方面危害全面地、有根有据地加以论述。例如，种烟占用本来为数不多的耕地，与粮棉油争地；烤烟消耗大量木柴；产烟容易得利，从而妨害了对其它生产的安排；吸烟引起疾病的统计性数字及机制；吸烟引起的社会关系矛盾与侵犯他人权利问题；吸烟引起环境污染、大量火灾；吸烟与现代高技术生产的矛盾；吸烟的经济账与个人及国家的得失；吸烟年轻化与犯罪年轻化同步的事实和调查资料等等。
    其次要针对吸烟者的心理及诡辩术作出科学的分析和判断，使其能够勇于承认吸烟不但有多方面危害并且是一种不文明行为。
    对电影、电视、摄影展览等宣传媒介要认真清理，尽量不要拍正面人物的吸烟镜头，如公安干警在要案面前要靠一支接一支的香烟来思索；有些作家也是一篇稿子几个烟头，硬把灵感归因于尼古丁的刺激，实在没有道理。
    在社会规范及法律方面，必须先肯定吸烟是社会一大公害，这样才能产生有步骤地推进戒烟活动。
    我们不妨制定一个几年之内的全国戒烟计划，既照顾到多数吸烟者的转变有一个过程，也使烟农烟厂、烟草公司来得及转轨变型，可以五年或十年为期。
    要严格限制外烟进口及销售，对非法贩卖及走私者要重罚。
    要硬性规定何种职业、何种年龄、何种场合、何种时间不得吸烟，并分别情况处理。例如，林区草原、仓库、古迹附近、医院、幼儿园、多数实验室、学校、国家机关、阵地哨位、各种运输工具中、食堂、大多数工厂……绝对禁止吸烟，对违者进行处罚。
    在有不吸烟人或年不满20岁人在场情况下，亦不得吸烟，否则作侵犯他人权利处治。
    从时间上说，第一年实行国际戒烟日，第二年每月7日为戒烟日、第三年实行戒烟周（戒烟日所属周）、第四年实行戒烟月……在此期间吸烟者均受处罚。
    除行业、职业性戒烟外，要建立无吸烟团体、无吸烟区，但不应是虚假的、形式主义的、应付上级的。因为有些职业（如医生、炊事员、食品及药品生产者……）及有些行业（如高精尖工业）需要戒烟是很明显的，但如果不创造一定社会环境，往往使首先主张戒烟者的模范行为成为他人攻击取笑的内容，而这些人也成了鸡群之鹤。最后不是相安无事便是被同化而前功尽弃。
    在以医学界及科技界为主体的党派中，如果能率先成为无吸烟团体，亦可一新耳目，表现其言行如一，给人以可信赖的感觉。
    要树立以不吸烟为荣的新风气，消除把旱烟改纸烟、中烟改外烟认为是现代化、是时髦的误解。
    总之，如马克思所说，一步实际行动胜过一打纲领，我们需要从立法入手，辅以宣传等措施，逐步戒烟，坚决戒烟！
