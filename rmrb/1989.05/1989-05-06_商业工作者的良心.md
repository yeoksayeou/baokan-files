The newspaper reported that in a time when prices were rising chaotically, the Dianmen Food Market in Beijing took the initiative to benefit customers. Squid, sea cucumbers, and yulan slices, which could be sold by weight without distinction, were instead sorted by size, with smaller ones sold at a price 13% lower than the standard price. There were dozens of such measures to benefit customers. Although the store lost five or six hundred thousand yuan in profits each year due to these measures, it won widespread praise and was awarded the title of one of the top ten stores nationwide for implementing price policies and regulations.

Reading this news, I have many thoughts. "Fair trading, no cheating" is the basic conscience of commerce. But now, some people say: "How much is conscience worth?" Haven't you heard this saying from individual business owners?—I don't care about "repeat customers," I just need to trick them once. With so many floating people, I'm not worried about not having customers.

China has a long tradition of looking down on commerce, and apart from the root cause of underdeveloped commodity economy, it is also related to the "greed" and "cunning" of some merchants in an unregulated market. These people are solely driven by profit, to the point of harming others for gain. They disregard the law and even lose their basic human conscience. In the story of "Say Tang," Cheng Yaojin sells firewood by force, and isn't he persuaded by conscience?

Today, during the transition between old and new systems, phenomena such as monopolizing the market and cheating customers exist not only due to subjective reasons but also due to various objective factors. First, the necessary regulations for developing a commodity economy are not yet perfect; second, many commodities are in a state of severe shortage; third, market management has loopholes and blind spots, and so on. With the development of the commodity economy, it is necessary to continuously strengthen and improve market management. However, as market entities, commercial operators should also strive to maintain their image. Commerce is a window industry for society. Promoting commercial workers to act with conscience and morality not only helps to purify social customs but is also often the successful path for high-level operators. Those model stores that strictly implement price policies and regulations, regardless of the goods, can first win the favor of customers with their reputation. A bustling store, adhering to the principle of low profit and high volume, creates a harmonious atmosphere of mutual trust, which can improve the mood of both sellers and buyers and enhance operational efficiency.

Therefore, the conscience of commercial workers has dual value for both individuals and society.

### 商业工作者的良心

　　商业工作者的良心
    瓯亮
    报载，在乱涨价成风的情况下，北京市地安门副食品商场，却主动让利于顾客。鱿鱼、海参、玉兰片等水发货本可不论大小，均按标准价卖，但他们专门把稍小的拣出，低于标准价百分之十三出售……如此让利措施，有数十项，尽管商店每年因此少赢利五六万元，但赢得了广泛赞誉，荣获全国执行物价政策法规十佳商店称号。
    读此消息，颇多感慨。“公平买卖，童叟无欺”是起码的商业良心。可如今，有人说：“良心值多少钱？”你不曾听到这么一句个体户格言吗？——我就是不要什么“回头客”，坑他一回就行了。这么多流动人口，我还愁没有人到我这儿来？
    中国自古以来有轻商贱商的传统，除了商品经济不发达这个总根源外，恐怕也与在市场秩序不健全的情况下，某些经商者的“贪”、“奸”有关。这些人唯利是图，直至图财害命，别说置国法于不顾，就连起码的人的良知都丧失殆尽。《说唐》里程咬金卖柴扒，强买强卖，不是还被人以良知相劝么？
    而今，在新旧体制交替时期，欺行霸市，坑骗顾客的现象除了主观原因外，从客观上讲，原因也是多方面的。一是发展商品经济必要的法规尚不健全；二是不少商品处于严重供不应求的状态；三是市场管理工作存在着漏洞、死角，等等。随着商品经济的发展，不断加强和完善市场管理，固然是必要的，但作为市场主体的商业经营者，也当努力维护自己的形象。商业是社会的窗口行业，提倡商业工作者讲良心，讲道德，不仅有利于净化社会风气，而且，往往是有水平的经营者的成功之道。那些模范执行物价政策法规的商店，先不论商品如何，商店的芳名首先就能博得顾客青睐。商店门庭若市，坚持薄利多销，一种融洽的彼此信任的气氛，不仅可以使卖者与买者的心境得到改善，而且可以提高经营的效益。
    所以说，商业工作者的良心，对个人、对社会具有双重的价值。
