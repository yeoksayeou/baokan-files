The Arab League Summit is approaching, and Egypt has received a formal invitation.

Our reporter, Lin Jiaoming, reports from Cairo on May 17: Egypt received the invitation to participate in the emergency Arab Summit to be held in Casablanca, Morocco, on May 23, yesterday.

This invitation was formally issued by King Hassan II of Morocco in a telephone call to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak yesterday evening. King Hassan II simultaneously invited Egypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs to attend the Arab foreign ministers' meeting scheduled for May 20 to jointly prepare the agenda for this summit.

According to the Middle East News Agency, after consultations among the heads of Arab League member states, especially after Syria agreed to invite the Egyptian President to attend this summit, the host of the conference, King Hassan II, issued the formal invitation to Egypt.

This is the first time Egypt has attended an Arab Summit since its membership in the Arab League was suspended in 1979.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 15: According to the Middle East News Agency, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said today, "There are no differences between Egypt and Syria or between me and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad."

Mubarak made this statement after Syria announced on May 14 that it would no longer oppose his participation in the Arab Summit to be held in Morocco this month and welcomed Egypt's return to the Arab League.

He said, "We appreciate President Assad's good statement."

On the same day, Egyptian Vice Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Boutros Boutros-Ghali also stated that Syria's change in attitude towards Egypt indicates that Damascus is ready to work with other Arab countries for the common cause of the Arab nation.

　　阿盟首脑会议在即  埃及接到正式邀请
    本报开罗５月１７日电  记者林皎明报道：埃及昨天收到参加本月２３日在摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡召开的阿拉伯紧急首脑会议的正式邀请。
    这一邀请是摩洛哥国王哈桑二世昨天晚间打电话向埃及总统穆巴拉克正式发出的。哈桑二世国王同时邀请埃及外交部长出席２０日召开的阿拉伯国家外长会议，共同筹备本届首脑会议议程。
    据埃及中东通讯社报道，阿拉伯联盟各国元首经过相互联系磋商，特别是在叙利亚同意邀请埃及总统出席本届首脑会议后，会议东道主哈桑二世向埃及发出正式邀请。
    这是埃及自１９７９年被中止阿盟成员资格后第一次出席阿拉伯首脑会议。
    新华社开罗５月１５日电　据中东社报道，埃及总统穆巴拉克今天说，“无论是埃及和叙利亚之间还是我同叙利亚总统阿萨德之间都不存在分歧。”
    穆巴拉克是在叙利亚１４日宣布不再反对他参加本月在摩洛哥举行的阿拉伯首脑会议和欢迎埃及重返阿拉伯联盟后作上述表示的。
    他说：“我们感谢阿萨德总统这个很好的声明。”
    同一天，埃及副总理兼外交部长马吉德也表示，叙利亚改变对埃及的态度，表明大马士革准备同其它阿拉伯国家携手为阿拉伯事业而共同奋斗。
