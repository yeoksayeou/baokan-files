The Autonomous Province of Kosovo in Yugoslavia has issued an order through its Interior Department, based on a decision by the Executive Committee of the Provincial Assembly (the provincial government), to lift martial law starting May 22. This means that residents of Kosovo and those from other parts of Yugoslavia can move freely within the province. However, public demonstrations and protests are still prohibited.

The martial law was imposed on March 27 after Albanian separatists smashed shops, burned cars, damaged public buildings, and attacked security forces and police with weapons and other objects, leading to a serious outbreak of violence. The lifting of martial law indicates that the situation in Kosovo is gradually returning to normal.

Newly appointed Chairman of the Yugoslav Federal Presidency, Dejan Dejanović, emphasized the need to maintain stability and unity in Yugoslavia, while respecting the differences between the republics.

He made these remarks in an interview with the upcoming issue of the West German magazine Der Spiegel.

Dejanović said his primary goal is to support the new government of Ante Marković in implementing its market economy program, and another objective is to integrate Yugoslavia into the European integration process.

Regarding the domestic situation, he stated that he will strive to contribute to the easing of political and ethnic tensions in Yugoslavia. He said he does not expect complete unanimity in Yugoslavia.

He believes that Yugoslavia must seek unity in diversity, and that Yugoslavia can only maintain stability within a system that acknowledges differences. For Yugoslavia, it is important to be economically united.

　　南科索沃撤消戒严
    联邦主席团要求保持稳定和团结
    本报贝尔格莱德５月２１日电  记者严正报道：南斯拉夫科索沃自治省内务部根据省议会执行委员会（即省政府）的决定发布命令，５月２２日开始撤消自治省范围内的戒严，这意味着科索沃以及来自南斯拉夫其它地区的居民即日起可在那里自由行动，但仍禁止在公共场所举行示威和抗议集会。
    上述戒严是在３月２７日阿族分裂主义示威者砸商店、焚烧汽车、破坏公共建筑等社会财富并用武器和其它器物攻击安全机构和警察，挑起流血事件，即科索沃局势最为严重时开始实行的，撤消戒严则表明科索沃的局势越来越趋向正常化。
    新华社贝尔格莱德５月２１日电　新上任的南斯拉夫联邦主席团主席德尔诺夫舍克强调，必须保持南斯拉夫的稳定和团结，但要尊重各共和国之间的差别。
    他是对将于明天出版的西德《明镜》周刊发表谈话时说这番话的。
    德尔诺夫舍克在谈话中说，他的首要目的是支持马尔科维奇新政府实现市场经济纲领，另一个目标是使南斯拉夫参加欧洲一体化进程。
    他在谈到国内局势时指出，他将努力为缓和南斯拉夫的政治和民族紧张关系作出贡献。他说，他并不期待南斯拉夫保持完全一致。
    他认为，南斯拉夫必须在差别中求团结，南斯拉夫只有在承认差别的制度中才能保持稳定。对南斯拉夫来说，重要的是在经济上成为一个整体。
