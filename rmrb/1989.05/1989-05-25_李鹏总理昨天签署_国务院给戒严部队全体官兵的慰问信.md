Premier Li Peng signed today the State Council's letter of greetings to all officers and soldiers of the martial law troops in Beijing. The full text is as follows:

Dear officers and soldiers of the Beijing martial law troops:

To stop the turmoil, restore order in the capital, protect key departments and public property from being damaged, and safeguard the lives and property of the people, you have been ordered to come to Beijing to carry out martial law duties. You have worked hard! The State Council extends to you its cordial greetings and profound respect!

In the course of carrying out your duties, you have stood firm, been clear-cut, and shown a high level of political awareness and good military qualities. In the midst of social disorder, you have gone for days without proper food, sleep, or rest, fearing neither hardship nor fatigue, and maintaining high morale. When faced with obstruction by misinformed masses and assaults by a few lawless elements, you have considered the overall situation, borne insults without retaliating, endured hardships, and strictly observed discipline, fully demonstrating your love and loyalty to the people. You have carried on the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army in working with the masses, actively and patiently explaining and propagating to the people, loving the capital, loving the people of the capital, and loving the young students. With your actual deeds, you have written a new chapter of supporting the government and loving the people under special conditions, making great contributions to the restoration of order in the capital and the stabilization of the situation in Beijing and throughout the country. You have won high praise and acclaim from all sectors of society. Practice has once again proved that you are the sturdy pillars of the People's Republic, the righteous and civilized army loyal to the Party and the people. The Party and the government thank and trust you! The people understand and support you!

Recently, the three general departments of the People's Liberation Army sent a letter of greetings to you, hoping that in carrying out martial law duties, you will study hard, be clear about your responsibilities, and wage a resolute struggle against the plots of a very few people. They hope that you will not fear difficulties, be indomitable, maintain strict discipline, implement policies, carry out duties in a civilized manner, and strengthen unity. These requirements represent the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities throughout the country and also reflect the earnest expectations of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission for you. The Beijing Municipal Government will certainly do a good job of explaining, educating the masses to love the sons and daughters of the people, and take effective measures to provide convenient conditions for you in your work, life, and study, and cooperate with you in carrying out martial law duties. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and with the support of the masses, all comrades in the Beijing martial law troops will surely live up to expectations, overcome all kinds of difficulties, and successfully complete the martial law duties. You will make new contributions to ending the chaotic situation, maintaining stability and unity, and promoting reform and construction.
