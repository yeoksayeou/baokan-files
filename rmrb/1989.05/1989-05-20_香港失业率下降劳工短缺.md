Hong Kong's unemployment rate has further decreased in the first quarter of this year, indicating that the labor shortage situation has not improved. Additionally, a Japanese research institution's survey shows that Hong Kong's average wage level is the highest among developing countries and regions in Asia.

In the first three months of this year, Hong Kong had 35,800 unemployed individuals, a job shortage rate of 0.8%, and 21,300 individuals experiencing job shortages. In the same period last year, these figures were 44,500, 0.9%, and 25,200 respectively.

The latest issue of the Hong Kong Industrial Monthly features a survey conducted by the Japanese Mitsubishi Research Institute in January. According to the survey, among the eight Asian countries and regions surveyed, Hong Kong's average wage level is the highest, ranging from $400 to $450.

Hong Kong newspapers believe that the labor shortage and high wage levels are causing headaches for both local and foreign manufacturers. Besides labor-intensive manufacturing industries shifting to Thailand and mainland China, even higher-tech manufacturing industries are showing a trend of moving to other regions.

　　香港失业率下降劳工短缺
    新华社香港电  港府近日公布的最新数字表明，今年首季度香港失业率进一步下降，显示劳工短缺状况并无改善。另据一日本调研机构调查，香港的平均工资水平已居亚洲发展中国家及地区之首。
    今年前三个月香港的失业人数为３．５８万人，就业不足率为０．８％，就业不足人数为２．１３万人，而去年同期这三项指标则分别为４．４５万人、０．９％和２．５２万人。
    最新一期香港工业月刊刊登的日本三菱研究所今年１月份的调查统计显示，在被调查的八个亚洲国家和地区中，香港的平均工资水平居首位，为４００至４５０美元。
    港报认为，劳工短缺及工资水平高已使香港本地及外来厂商感到头疼，除劳工密集型的制造业转向泰国及中国内地外，较高技术的制造业也有转向其它地区的趋势。
