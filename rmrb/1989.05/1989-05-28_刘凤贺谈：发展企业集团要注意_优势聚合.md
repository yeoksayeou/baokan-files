Edition: 6

In the article "Reflections on Enterprise Groups," Liu Fenghe delves into the issue of township and village enterprises developing into enterprise groups. He believes that in the face of increasingly fierce all-around competition, township and village enterprises must adhere to the principle of mutual benefit and self-reliance, break through the boundaries of departments, regions, industries, and ownership, and take a planned approach to developing into enterprise groups. This will achieve an optimized combination of enterprises and form a group of enterprises centered around key products, thereby ensuring the sustained and healthy development of township and village enterprises. To this end, township and village enterprises should not only focus on collaborating with urban enterprises but also with research institutions, actively participating in development-oriented enterprise groups that integrate scientific research with production.

The author points out that currently, the main collaborations between township and village enterprises and urban enterprises involve small-scale enterprises, with clear strengths and weaknesses. In the future, emphasis should be placed on the collaboration between township and village enterprises with technological and economic strength and large urban enterprises. Particularly, efforts should be made to create conditions and find ways to enter various influential enterprise groups, leveraging the strength of "large ships" to weather storms and continue development. At the same time, when township and village enterprises develop their own famous and high-quality products and become key enterprises in the industry, they should seek out similar advantageous enterprises for "advantage aggregation," making the strong even stronger.

　　刘凤贺谈：
    发展企业集团要注意“优势聚合”
    刘凤贺在《关于企业集团的思考》一文中着重探索了乡镇企业发展企业集团问题。他认为，在日趋激烈的全方位竞争中，乡镇企业要想持续地健康发展，就要本着自主互利的原则，打破部门、地区、行业和所有制的界限，有计划地走上发展企业集团的道路，实现企业的优化组合，形成以优势产品为骨干的企业群体和集团。为此，乡镇企业不仅要重视与城市企业联合，还要重视与科研单位联合，积极参加科研与生产相结合的开发型企业集团。
    作者指出，目前，乡镇企业和城市企业实行联合的，主要是小型企业，强弱分明。今后，还应强调有技术和经济实力的乡镇企业同城市大企业间的联合。特别是要创造条件，设法挤进各种已经产生影响的企业集团，借助“大船”的力量来抗击风浪，继续发展。同时，当乡镇企业形成自己的名优产品，成为行业的骨干企业时，还需要寻找同类优势企业进行“优势聚合”，使强者更强。
