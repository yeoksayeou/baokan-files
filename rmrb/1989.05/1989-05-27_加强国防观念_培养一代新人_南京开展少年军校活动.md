Rows of vibrant young cadets, in unison with the instructor's stern commands, performed a flawless, precise, and swift four-directional turn, marching towards the review stand. This scene was witnessed by the reporter at the "Youth Military School" parade held recently at Fengyou Temple Primary School in Nanjing's Qinhuai District.

The establishment of a "Youth Military School" within a primary school is a pioneering effort in China. The primary goal of this activity is to integrate national defense education with moral and ethical education.

The once-pampered "little emperors," doted on by grandparents, parents, and now ordinary soldiers in the "military school," endure the monotony of standing at attention, at ease, and marching in unison. Despite trembling legs, blurry vision, and sore backs, no one dares to speak out of turn. After visiting the military camp, the primary school students broadened their horizons. Soldiers taught them hands-on how to fold blankets and tidy up their quarters, imparting many valuable skills.

The Youth Military School offers a variety of engaging activities. The "school" includes lectures, military training, demonstration performances, visits, drills, and life experiences. Military instructors are invited to the school for guidance and training, and students are organized to "intern" at military units. The primary school students are most enthusiastic about interacting with soldiers, watching demonstrations of wrestling and combat techniques, and listening to reports from war heroes.

According to a survey, 54% of the students found military training to be grueling, but 100% of the students believed the "military school" was well-run. In the section about their future aspirations, out of 175 students, 128 chose to join the military. Two chose to become individual business owners, and four students who initially wanted to join the military changed their minds after the training.

　　加强国防观念　培养一代新人
    南京开展少年军校活动
    本报讯  一排排朝气勃勃的童子军队伍，随着教员威严的口令，整齐、准确、利索地完成四面转向，走向检阅台。这是笔者日前在南京市秦淮区凤游寺小学举行的“少年军校”阅兵式上看到的一组镜头。
    小学里开展“少年军校”活动，在我国还是第一次。融国防教育、思想品德教育为一体是这次活动的宗旨。
    昔日爷爷奶奶宠，爸爸妈妈疼的“小皇帝”在“军校”里都是普通一兵。单调的立正、稍息、齐步走，腿发抖、眼发直、腰发酸，但谁都不敢乱讲话；参观部队营区后小学员大开眼界，战士们手把手地教他们叠被子、整内务，使他们学会了不少本领。
    少年军校形式多样趣味性浓。“军校”里有讲座、军训、观看示范表演、参观、会操、体验生活等内容，还请部队教员来校辅导训练，组织学员去部队“实习”。小学员们最有兴趣的是与战士们联欢、看战士们擒拿格斗表演及战斗英雄的报告。
    据一个调查表明，５４％的学生认为军训苦，但１００％的学生认为“军校”办得好。在了解学生今后理想这一栏里，１７５名学生中有１２８名选择了参军。有２名选择了当个体户，４名学生军训前想当兵，军训后放弃了这个志愿。
