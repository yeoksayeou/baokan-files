An Uneventful Yet Innovative 100 Days

By Zhang Qixun, Our Correspondent

As of April 30, President Bush has been in office for 100 days. Opinions within the United States on this new president seem to fall into two main categories. Some political commentators criticize, saying that these 100 days have been uneventful, lacking any remarkable achievements or grand visions. Meanwhile, the general public praises him, saying that the president has done well, showcasing his unique style. In two public opinion polls conducted by American newspapers and radio stations in April, 61% and 72% of respondents gave Bush's performance positive ratings, nearly matching or surpassing Reagan's scores in April 1981. Both of these evaluations have their merits. They reflect the unique situation of this administration and the president's style, as well as the state of the country during Bush's first 100 days in office.

Bush began his work in a relatively calm domestic and international environment. Although there are many serious problems at home, none are urgent; abroad, there are no imminent major crises. Bush inherited a stable economy from his predecessor, with a GDP growth rate of around 3%, good industrial production, factory operation rates, and employment levels. Inflation, interest rates, and the stock market have fluctuated but show no signs of crisis. For Bush's administration, there seems to be no urgent need to propose radically different policies as Reagan did. Internationally, the trend towards détente allows the Bush team to review policies at length without rushing. The Economist magazine also notes that the U.S. government is largely shaped by the president's personal style, which plays a significant role. Generally, people see Bush as different from Reagan, valuing practicality over rhetoric, seeking compromise over confrontation, and acting cautiously rather than impulsively. These traits have deeply influenced the work of the current government.

Over the past three months, what has Bush accomplished? This has been a topic of discussion in recent days. The consensus is that he has done a lot, addressing issues of concern such as the fiscal deficit, savings and loan crisis, drugs, homelessness, and regional problems like Central America, the Middle East, and global debt. From these actions, two clear trends emerge: the new government is tackling problems left over from the Reagan era, and it is making necessary adjustments to existing policies.

The situation over the past three months shows that the relationship between the government and Congress has undergone some changes. An American weekly points out that the U.S. is learning to live under a "unified government" mechanism. President Bush faces a reality of "opposition majorities in both houses of Congress," whose power has grown stronger after the 1988 elections, making it impossible for Bush to deal with Congress as Reagan did. On the day he was sworn in as president, Bush proposed the spirit of "bipartisan cooperation" and has adhered to this principle, even when facing the embarrassment of Torricelli's nomination being rejected, he skillfully avoided partisan disputes. Therefore, some comment that many issues that caused fierce debates during the Reagan era, such as aid to Nicaraguan contras, missile, and budget issues, now seem easier to compromise on. Of course, Bush has paid some prices for this, but he has also gained some concessions from Congress. This situation has also sparked some criticism within the political circles, so the "bipartisan cooperation" between the government and Congress will be constantly tested in the future, becoming a new trend in American political life.

The situation over the past three months also indicates that the new government is adopting a more cautious and realistic approach in foreign affairs. The government's tone is not as strongly ideological as Reagan's but more focused on practicality. This is evident in handling issues related to Central America, the Middle East, and the European short-range missile problem, and even more so in foreign policy and strategic issues, especially in policy towards the Soviet Union. Some complain that Bush's foreign policy actions are too slow, but the New York Times believes that taking a cautious approach may be wise. This is because the current issues involve the power balance in the "post-Cold War" era. The U.S. must carefully plan its relations with Europe, Japan, and the Soviet Union, and address the legacy of the Cold War.

Americans like to discuss the new president's first 100 days and use it to gauge the future. However, for this administration, its performance in the initial period may not fully determine its direction for the remaining 1360 days. The first 100 days are indeed important, but the days that follow are even more crucial, especially in solving fundamental domestic issues and foreign policy.

### 平淡无奇又有新意的一百天

　　平淡无奇又有新意的一百天
    本报记者  张启昕
    到４月３０日，布什总统执政已经１００天。美国国内对于这位新总统作何评价，看来大体上有两种意见。一些政治评论家批评说，这１００天平淡无奇，没有惊人的创举，也缺少远大的目标；而一般公众则称赞说，总统干得不错，显示出了自己的特有风格。在４月间，美国报纸和广播系统先后进行的两次民意测验中，对布什的政绩给以好评的人数占６１％和７２％，接近和超过了里根１９８１年４月的得分。美国人的这两种评价都有一定依据，他们从不同角度评论了布什政府执政初期既平淡又有新意的状况，而这种状况正好反映了这届政府所处的特定环境和总统的作风。
    布什是在一种国内外相对平静的环境下开始工作的。国内虽然存在着不少严重问题，但毕竟没有碰到危急的情况；在国外也没有遇到迫在眉睫的重大危机。布什继承前任的遗产，其有利的方面是８０年代后期的美国经济状况相对稳定，国民生产总值保持在３％上下，工业生产、厂矿开工率和就业程度处于良好状态，通货膨胀、利率和股票市场虽有波动，但还没有出现危机的迹象。对布什政府来说，当前似无必要像里根当年那样提出迥然不同的主张。国际上，缓和的趋势也使布什班子能够从容进行长时间的政策回顾，而不匆忙行事。《经济学家》周刊还认为，美国政府很大程度上带有总统的个人色彩，总统的作风起着很大作用。对于布什，一般人认为他同里根不同，注重务实而不尚空谈，寻求和解而不好斗，谨慎从事而不轻率行动是他的一些特点，这就给现政府的工作打下了深刻的印记。
    三个多月来布什的政绩是什么？这是最近一些天来舆论界都在议论的，相同的认识是他作了不少事情，从人们关心的财政赤字、储贷危机到毒品、无家可归问题以及诸如中美洲、中东和世界债务等问题，新政府都已开始行动。从三个月来的行动中，人们看到两个明显的特征，一是新政府正在着手清理里根遗产中遗留下的问题，二是对原来的方针政策也在进行必要的修补和调整。　
    三个多月的情况表明，政府与国会的关系发生了某种变化。美国一家周刊指出，美国正在学习如何在一种“联合政府”的机制下生活。布什总统在国内面对的一个现实是“国会两院的反对派多数”，他们的力量在经过１９８８年大选后不是减弱而是加强了，这就使布什不可能像里根那样对待国会。他在宣誓就任总统那天就提出“两党合作”精神，并坚持了这一条，即使在碰到托尔任命被否决的窘境时也巧妙地避开了党派之争。因此有人评论说，许多在里根时代引起激烈争论的问题，如援助尼加拉瓜反政府力量、导弹和预算问题，现在突然间看起来比较容易妥协了。当然，布什为此付出了一些代价，但也赢得了国会的一些让步。这种状况也引起政界的一些非议，因此，政府和国会之间的“两党合作”，在今后将时时处于考验之中，成为美国政治生活的一个新的动向。
    三个月的情况还表明，新政府在外交方面采取更为谨慎的现实主义。政府的基调不是像里根那样强烈地强调意识形态，而是更注重实际。在处理中美洲、中东问题以及欧洲短导问题是这样，在外交和战略问题特别是对苏政策方面更是这样。有人抱怨说，布什在外交上行动过分迟缓，但《纽约时报》认为，采取谨慎的步调可能是明智的。这是因为现在的问题涉及“冷战后”时代的力量平衡，美国必须仔细规划美欧日关系和美苏关系，处理冷战产生的遗留问题。
    美国人喜欢谈论新总统开头的１００天，并依此来衡量未来。但是，对于这届政府，它的执政初期的表现似乎还不能完全确定它今后１３６０天的动向。开头的１００天固然重要，但１００天后的日子更为重要，特别是在解决国内带根本性的问题和外交政策上更是如此。　　　　　（本报华盛顿４月２８日电）
