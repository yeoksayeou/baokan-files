The majority opinion: the enterprise contract system is a realistic choice and cannot be shaken;
Some people calculate that in 1988, after the nationwide implementation of the enterprise contract system, the state's fiscal revenue decreased;

Is the contract system good or bad? Can it be continued? Recently, the State Commission for Economic System Reform held a national symposium on the enterprise contract responsibility system in Beijing, weighing the pros and cons, and clearly stating the current focus of enterprise reform:

Since the second half of 1987, the enterprise contract responsibility system has been widely implemented nationwide, marking a significant step in China's enterprise reform. In recent times, some individuals have published articles in newspapers, arguing that after the implementation of the enterprise contract system in 1988, the state's fiscal revenue did not increase but rather decreased; some say that the contract system has fueled the expansion of the consumption fund, driving up prices. A Hong Kong newspaper even published an article stating that China's implementation of the enterprise contract system is a failure. These statements that shake and negate the direction of the contract system reform have caused strong reactions in the enterprise sector and have temporarily created confusion.

Is the contract system effective or not? Should it be continued? Given that approximately 17% of enterprises will have their contracts expire this year and about 60% next year, and will enter the next phase of contracting, the evaluation of the contract system will inevitably relate to the question of how to proceed with the next phase of enterprise reform, which is of great concern to all.

The contract system is a realistic choice, contracting is better than not contracting, and the results are obvious

The evaluation of enterprise reform results and the judgment of whether various measures are appropriate should be based on whether they help to activate enterprises and promote the continuous and stable development of productive forces. To implement the central government's policy of rectification and adjustment, stabilize the overall economy, and stabilize enterprises and people's minds, the State Commission for Economic System Reform recently held a national symposium on the enterprise contract responsibility system in Beijing. It was clearly stated that the current focus of enterprise reform is to continue to improve and develop the contract system. The majority of participants believe that in the current stage, China's commodity economy is not developed, and the level of productive forces is relatively low. Enterprises vary greatly, which determines that we cannot simply copy foreign enterprise management models or pursue ideal models designed subjectively. Instead, we should start from the national conditions to choose and determine the enterprise management methods. Practice has proven that the contract system is a realistic choice and is irreplaceable by other enterprise management methods at this stage. The proposal by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to "seriously improve the contract system" is in line with reality, and the contract system cannot be shaken.

In 1988, the work of enterprise contracting was carried out under extremely difficult external conditions. Due to economic overheating, rapid price increases, and shortages of energy, funds, and raw materials, the normal production and operation of enterprises were directly affected. At the same time, the state introduced some new policies and measures, with more factors reducing profits, increasing the burden on enterprises. However, under these difficult conditions, the contracting mechanism played a positive role. According to statistics from various regions and departments, more than 90% of enterprises completed their contracting agreements last year, and the contract system passed a severe test, achieving great success.

So, how was the economic efficiency of enterprises in various places after implementing the contract system last year? According to financial reports, the output value of state-owned industrial enterprises increased by 10.7% compared to the previous year, and sales revenue increased by 22.4%; the total profit and tax revenue was 155.77 billion yuan, an increase of 23 billion yuan, up by 17.4% (tax revenue increased by 20.3%, and profit increased by 14.1%). Among them, 9,024 state-owned large and medium-sized industrial enterprises that implemented the contract system achieved a profit and tax revenue increase of 20.8% compared to the previous year.

Did the state's fiscal revenue decrease? Last year, state-owned industrial enterprises remitted corporate income tax and adjustment tax (i.e., remitted profits) totaling 22.9 billion yuan, a decrease of 11.3%. However, the reduction in remitted profits does not mean that enterprises' contributions to the state have decreased. Because enterprises' contributions to the state include not only remitted profits but also turnover taxes and other fees collected by the state from enterprises. In the past, the state collected money from enterprises through a single channel, but now it collects money through multiple channels. In recent years, the state has added new types of taxes and fees, such as land use tax, education surcharge, vehicle and vessel use tax (this year, stamp duty has also been added), as well as key construction bonds, power construction fund, national treasury bonds, energy and transportation fund (this year, the budget adjustment fund has also been added). The part of the remitted corporate income tax and adjustment tax (i.e., remitted profits) that decreased is actually remitted to the state through the adjustment of turnover tax rates and the increase in new taxes and fees. Enterprises' profits always account for only about 16% of the realized profit and tax, of which 40% is used for production development, increasing fixed assets that still belong to the state, and the rest is used for employees' welfare and rewards. This shows that the vast majority of the profit and tax realized by enterprises are remitted to the state.

Many comrades believe that true contracting according to the principle of "fixed base number and guaranteed remittance" in the "Contract Regulations" will only increase, not decrease, the profits and taxes remitted by enterprises to the state. From the situation in 1988, the effects of contracting in various places were better than those without contracting. As a comrade from Hebei said, without the enterprise management mechanism reform centered on the contract system, the economic benefits of the past two years would not have been as good, and fiscal revenue would not have been able to maintain stable growth.

Enterprise reform cannot be expected to be completed in one step, and the contract system itself has defects

The enterprise contract system, like other reform measures, has a development process and cannot be expected to be completed in one step. The deeper the reform, the greater the difficulties and contradictions encountered.

Currently, the external environment of enterprises is still very severe. The problem of separation of government and enterprise has not been completely solved, and government interference in enterprises is too much, making it difficult for enterprises to achieve independent operation; the market for production factors is not sound, and regional and departmental divisions make it difficult for superior enterprises to expand and inferior enterprises to be eliminated, making it difficult to implement industrial policies and adjust enterprise structures and product structures; there are too many assignments and inspections from various parties, making it difficult for enterprises to bear, and there is a lack of effective measures to correct them; unclear property rights and unassessed assets bring many difficulties to the contracting, leasing, mergers and acquisitions, and horizontal economic cooperation between enterprises, etc. Especially in recent years, prices have risen too fast, and the tight situation of funds, raw materials, energy, and transportation has been prominent.

On the other hand, the contract system itself also has defects. According to the analysis from various places, the main defects are: under the current system, the contract system has a low degree of separation of "two rights," making it difficult to completely avoid improper interference in the production and operation activities of enterprises; the base number contract can only achieve limited profit and loss, making it difficult to achieve complete self-profit and self-loss; the state directly contracts with the operator, making it difficult for the role of the workers as masters to be fully reflected; unclear property rights make it difficult for enterprise behavior to be completely reasonable.

The occurrence of the above problems is due to the defects in the original contract system structure. Therefore, how to work on the reform of the contract system structure in the future, and further improve and develop the contract system, is an important task facing us.

Currently, some people attribute the problems caused by macro-control failures and certain short-term behaviors due to uncoordinated reforms to the promotion of the contract system, and even have the tendency to take back enterprise powers and negate the contract system. This is not only extremely unfair but also puts great pressure and doubts on enterprises.

In March of this year, the State Council approved and forwarded the "Key Points of Economic System Reform in 1989" by the State Commission for Economic System Reform, once again clearly stating that the main content of the reform in 1989 is to further improve and develop the enterprise contract responsibility system. Participants in the symposium unanimously believe that overcoming difficulties requires the contract system, and the more difficult it is, the more we should insist on the contract system, which is the correct choice at present.

Pay attention to studying new situations and new problems in contracting, and continuously improve and develop in the process of rectification and adjustment

Currently, the contract system faces many new situations and new problems, the most prominent of which are three: first, the contradiction between the enterprise's contracting base number and the changing external conditions; second, some enterprises have short-term behaviors to a certain extent, lacking necessary restraint mechanisms; third, the contract system has overcome the phenomenon of egalitarianism in distribution, but new unfair distribution has emerged. We must seriously study and solve these problems.

Regarding the contracting base number. Due to changes in external conditions, such as a significant increase in the price of raw materials, while the price of products is too strictly controlled, enterprises find it difficult to digest; the tightening of credit has made a considerable number of enterprises, especially those with good operating conditions, face a shortage of working capital, bringing difficulties to production organization; the adjustment of product structure will restrict the production of some enterprises, and even prohibit production, directly affecting the completion of enterprises' contracting tasks. Some comrades from Shandong believe that the base number for enterprises to remit profits should generally be stable, advocating that enterprises look inward, strengthen management, save and tap potential, and self-digest to ensure remittance. On this basis, if the price of state-mandated plan products changes or new projects are completed and put into production, which have a significant impact on the base number, the base number should be adjusted in a realistic and differentiated manner according to the provisions of the "Contract Regulations."

Regarding short-term behaviors. This is a long-standing problem that the contract system has tried to solve but has not yet solved. Everyone believes that the causes of enterprises' short-term behaviors are multifaceted, and therefore, solving this problem should also be approached from multiple angles and comprehensively treated. First, policies must be stabilized. Only with stable policies can people's minds be stabilized, and long-term plans can be made. Second, macro-control measures must be strengthened, and rectification and adjustment measures must be implemented. Through rectification and adjustment, a good external environment should be created for enterprises, and a new commodity economic order should be established. Third, enterprises should establish self-restraint mechanisms. Various departments should also use economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and ideological and political work methods to strengthen management and supervision, restrain and guide the behavior of enterprises.

Regarding new unfair distribution. This is a major issue affecting the relationship between enterprise managers and producers, and is also an important reason for some workers' reverse psychology towards the contract system, which must be properly solved. Currently, various places are actively exploring and formulating new measures to address these new problems.

Enterprise personnel strongly appeal that the "Enterprise Law" and the "Contract Regulations" are the achievements of China's enterprise reform over the past few years, the essence of reform practice, and must be resolutely implemented and carried out. The road back is definitely not an option.

　　继续完善发展企业承包
    ○多数人的认识：企业承包制是现实的选择不能动摇；
    ○有人算帐，说１９８８年全国工业企业承包后国家财政收入有所下降；
    ○有人提出，承包制助长了消费基金膨胀，推动了物价上涨……
    ○承包制到底功过如何，能否坚持下去，国家体改委最近在北京召开全国
    企业承包经营责任制座谈会，权衡利弊，明确提出当前企业改革的重点：
    本报记者  刘国胜
    从１９８７年上半年开始，在全国范围内普遍实行的企业承包经营责任制，是我国企业改革的一个重大步骤。最近一个时期，一些人士在报刊上撰文，认为１９８８年全国工业企业实行承包后，不仅国家财政没有多收，反而有所下降；有人说，是承包制助长了消费基金膨胀，推动了物价上涨。一家香港报纸还刊登文章说，中国企业实行承包制是一次失败。这些动摇和否定承包制改革方向的说法，在企业界引起强烈反响，并一度产生混乱。
   承包制究竟行不行，还要不要继续坚持？鉴于今年约有１７％、明年约有６０％的企业承包合同期满，将要转入下一期承包，因而对承包制的评价如何，势必关系到下一步企业改革怎样进行这一众所关注的问题。
            承包制是现实的选择，包比不包要好，效果明显
    衡量企业改革的成果，判断各项措施是否得当，都要看是否有利于搞活企业，促进生产力持续稳定发展。为了落实中央关于治理整顿的方针，稳定经济全局，稳定企业，稳定人心，国家体改委最近在北京召开了全国企业承包经营责任制座谈会，明确提出，当前企业改革的重点是继续完善发展承包制，与会的大多数人认为，现阶段我国商品经济不发达，生产力水平比较低，企业千差万别，这就决定了我们不能简单照搬外国的企业经营模式，也不能追求主观设计的理想模式，而要从国情出发，来选择和确定企业经营方式。实践证明，承包制是现实的选择，在现阶段是其它企业经营方式所不能代替的。党中央和国务院提出要“认真完善承包制”是符合实际的，承包制不能动摇。
    １９８８年，企业的承包工作是在外部条件极为困难的情况下进行的。由于经济过热，价格上涨过猛，能源、资金、原材料紧缺等原因，直接影响了企业的正常生产经营。与此同时，国家又出台了一些新的政策措施，减利因素较多，企业负担加重。但在困难条件下，承包机制发挥了积极作用。据各地区、各部门统计，去年有９０％以上的企业完成了承包合同，承包制经受住了一次严峻的考验，取得了很大成绩。
    那么，去年各地实行承包制后企业的经济效益到底怎样？据财政快报，全国预算内工业企业的产值比上年增长１０．７％，销售收入增长２２．４％；实现利税总额１５５７．７亿元，净增２３０亿元，增长１７．４％（税金增长２０．３％，利润增长１４．１％）。其中实行承包制的９０２４个全民所有制大中型工业企业，实现的利税比上年增长２０．８％。
    国家的财政收入是不是少了？去年预算内工业企业上交所得税和调节税（即上交利润）２２９亿元，下降１１．３％。然而，上交利润的减少，并不表明企业对国家的贡献也减少了。因为企业对国家的贡献既包括上交利润，也包括流转税和其他国家向企业征收的费用。过去国家是一个口子从企业收钱，现在是几个口子收钱。近几年国家增设了新的税、费种类，如土地使用税、教育费附加、车船使用税（今年又增加了印花税）以及重点建设债券、电力建设基金、国库券、能源交通基金（今年又增加了预算调节基金）等。企业上交所得税和调节税（即上交利润）减少的那部分，实际上是通过流转税税率的调整和税的增加，以新的税、费形式上交了国家。企业所得，始终只占实现利税的１６％左右，其中又有４０％用于发展生产，增加的固定资产还是国家的，其余才用于职工的福利和奖励。这说明，企业实现的利税绝大部分都上交国家了。
    许多同志认为，真正按《承包条例》“包死基数、确保上交”原则进行承包的，企业上交国家利润和税金是只会增加不会减少的。从１９８８年的情况看，各地实行承包的都比不实行承包的效果要好。如同河北的同志所说，没有以承包制为主线的企业经营机制改革，近两年的经济效益就不会有现在这样的效果，财政收入也不可能稳定增长。
            企业改革不能期望一步到位，承包制自身也有缺陷
     企业承包制和其他改革措施一样，其发展有一个过程，不能期望一步到位。改革越深入，难度越大，遇到的困难和矛盾也会越多。
    当前企业的外部环境仍很严峻，政企不分的问题没有完全解决，政府对企业的不必要干预过多，企业难以做到自主经营；生产要素市场不健全，以及地区、部门分割，使优势企业难以扩展，落后企业难以淘汰，产业政策的贯彻以及企业结构、产品结构的调整难度很大；各方摊派多、检查多，企业难以承受，又缺乏得力措施加以纠正；产权关系不明、资产未经合理评估，给企业之间的承包、租赁、兼并以及横向经济联合带来不少困难，等等。特别是近年来物价上涨过猛，资金、原材料、能源、运输的紧张状况一直很突出。
    另一方面，承包制自身也还有缺陷，据各地分析，其主要缺陷是：现行体制下承包制“两权”分离度不高，难以完全避免对企业生产经营活动的不正当干预；基数承包只能实现利益上的有限盈亏，很难做到完全自负盈亏；国家直接同经营者承包，职工的主人翁地位难以充分体现；产权关系不明，企业行为很难完全合理。
    出现上述问题，究其根源在于原有承包制结构上存在缺陷，因此，今后如何在承包结构的改造上下功夫，进一步完善和发展承包制，是我们面临的重要课题。
    当前，有的人把宏观失控造成的问题和由于改革不配套产生的某些短期行为，都说成是推行承包制带来的，甚至存有上收企业权力和否定承包的倾向，这不仅是极为不公道的，而且给企业造成很大的压力和疑虑。
    今年３月，国务院批转了国家体改委关于１９８９年经济体制改革要点，再次明确指出，１９８９年改革的主要内容是，进一步完善和发展企业承包经营责任制。参加座谈的同志一致认为，克服困难要靠承包制，越困难越要坚持承包，这是当前的正确选择。
            注意研究承包中的新情况、新问题，在治理整顿中不断完善发展
    目前，承包制遇到的新情况、新问题比较多，最突出的有三个：一是企业的承包基数与多变的外部条件相矛盾；二是部分企业在一定程度上存有短期行为，缺乏必要的约束机制；三是承包制克服了分配上的平均主义现象，又出现新的分配不公。对于这些问题，我们必须认真研究解决。
    关于承包基数。由于外部条件发生变化，如原材料价格大幅度上涨，而产品价格又控制过死，企业难以消化；紧缩信贷，使相当一部分企业特别是经营状况好的企业流动资金紧张，给组织生产带来困难；调整产品结构，将使部分企业生产受到限制，甚至禁止生产，直接影响企业承包任务的完成。山东的一些同志认为，对企业上交利润基数，总的要稳定，提倡企业眼睛向内，通过加强管理、节约挖潜，自行消化，保证上交。在此前提下，国家指令性计划产品价格变动或新项目竣工投产，对承包基数有较大影响的，应根据《承包条例》规定，实事求是、有区别地调整基数。
    关于短期行为。这是一个长期存在、承包制想解决而还未解决的问题。大家认为，造成企业短期行为的原因是多方面的，因而，解决这个问题也应从多方面入手，进行综合治理。一是要稳定政策，政策稳，才能人心稳，才能打长谱。二是要加强宏观调控手段，落实治理、整顿措施。通过治理整顿为企业创造良好的外部环境，建立新的商品经济秩序。三是建立企业的自我约束机制。各部门也应当运用经济的、行政的、法律的、纪律的和思想政治工作的手段，加强管理和监督，约束、引导企业的行为。
    关于新的分配不公。这是影响企业经营者和生产者关系的大问题，也是部分职工对承包产生逆反心理的重要原因，必须妥善解决。目前，各地都在积极探索和制定新措施，着手解决这些新问题。
    企业界人士强烈呼吁，《企业法》和《承包条例》是几年来我国企业改革的成果，是改革实践总结出来的精华，必须坚决贯彻和落实，回头路万万走不得。
