Hundreds of cultural figures in the capital gathered today to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Ou Yang Yuqian's birth at the Central Academy of Drama. President Yang Shangkun sent a congratulatory message.

This "cultural giant," born 100 years ago in Hunan, studied in Japan during his youth. In 1907, during his time in Japan, he joined China's first and earliest drama troupe, the "Spring Willow Society," and participated in the performance of China's first spoken drama, "The Black Slave's Lament." Afterward, he acted as an amateur drama performer for six years and was one of the earliest performers of China's new drama. He acted as a professional performer for 16 years and achieved great success in the art of Peking Opera performance, being renowned alongside Mei Lanfang at the time and known as "Ou in the South, Mei in the North." Ying Ruocheng, the current vice-minister of the Ministry of Culture, was a student of Ou Yang Yuqian. He believes that the development of Chinese drama education, which has attracted worldwide attention, is inseparable from the efforts of this veteran drama educator.

　　首都数百文化界人士聚会    
    纪念欧阳予倩百年诞辰
    本报北京５月９日讯  今天上午，首都数百名文化界人士聚集在中央戏剧学院纪念欧阳予倩诞辰１００周年。国家主席杨尚昆发来贺电。
    这位１００年前出生于湖南的“文化巨人”，青少年时留学日本。他在１９０７年留日期间就参加了我国第一个最早的话剧团体“春柳社”并参加了我国第一个话剧《黑奴吁天录》的演出，此后他当过６年业余话剧演员，是中国新话剧的最早演员之一；他当过１６年的职业演员，在京剧表演艺术上取得了极高的成就，在当时与梅兰芳齐名，有“南欧北梅”之称。现任文化部副部长英若诚曾是欧阳予倩的学生，他认为中国戏剧教育的发展之所以能引起举世瞩目，与这位戏剧老教育家的努力是分不开的。
