Over the past four years, nearly 70% of the world records in men's swimming and track and field have been broken, prompting people to revisit an old question: Will world records continue to be broken indefinitely? What are the ultimate limits of human athletic performance?

An expert from the University of Berkeley, Cavanaugh, said, "A hundred years ago, the world's top sprinters had to work in a hat factory to make a living. Today, most track and field enthusiasts no longer need to engage in heavy physical labor to support themselves. Carl Lewis, after winning four gold medals at the 23rd Olympic Games, immediately received $250,000." Clearly, a developed economy and a good social environment are conducive to athletes pushing human athletic performance to its limits.

Experts believe that advances in science and technology play a crucial role in developing reasonable athletic techniques and improving performance, and they influence the ultimate limits of human athletic performance. In recent years, most world records have been achieved through improved techniques and the continuous improvement of sports equipment and facilities, rather than relying on a few athletic prodigies. After analyzing the film footage of Owens' performance at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, American researcher Ally Ally concluded that if Owens had used a synthetic track, worn modern high-quality running shoes, and used a starting block, his 100-meter time could have been improved by 0.4 seconds from 10.3 seconds, a result that would have been good enough to win a gold medal at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. The best men's marathon time improved by 25 minutes over 75 years, while women achieved the same improvement in just 15 years. Now, half of the women's swimming world records are at a level that would have won gold medals in men's swimming at the Mexico City Olympics. After changing from aluminum poles to fiberglass poles, the pole vault world record improved by nearly 60 centimeters. The impact of technical improvements is particularly evident in the high jump. Due to the technical revolution in the high jump by the gold medalist at the Mexico City Olympics, Fosbury, the world record improved by 10 centimeters, and the Fosbury flop remains the most superior high jump technique to this day.

Scientists have discovered through microscopic and in-depth research that the limits of many athletic events are determined by the laws of physics and biology. The speed of sprinters is influenced by the muscles and muscle cell structure that determine the movement of the limbs. The performance in middle-distance races depends on the effective use of oxygen to ensure the energy needed by the lower limbs. The endurance of long-distance runners depends on whether they can rationally allocate the energy reserves accumulated in the body before the race in the best way. The limits of human athletic performance lie in how much tension the bones and tendons can withstand, how fast the muscles can contract, and how much energy is needed to make the body work most efficiently.

American scientist Larry Mann analyzed the technical movements of several dozen excellent sprinters during their competitions, inputting the data of their arms, legs, and torso into a computer. Based on the calculations, he listed 15 factors that determine sprinting speed, found the "ideal sprinter" model, and deduced that the ultimate limit for men's 100 meters is 9.58 seconds. Larry Mann said that an athlete who can surpass this record will never appear. He said that if Griffith Joyner had not retired, she could have improved her performance by 0.27 seconds from 10.49 seconds with intensive training and further improvement in physical training.

Scientists have analyzed and predicted the ultimate limits for several men's track and field jumping events:

Pole Vault: World record 6.06 meters, theoretical limit 7.82 meters
The manufacturing technology of the pole has become a decisive factor in performance improvement. Fiberglass acts like a catapult, releasing the energy accumulated during the approach and takeoff, sending the athlete into the air. However, some energy is lost due to friction and vibration in the pole. If new materials are developed, the performance can be further improved. However, even the most ideal pole will not be able to improve the current world record by more than 1.80 meters.

Long Jump: World record 8.90 meters, theoretical limit 10.34 meters
The faster the approach, the higher the takeoff, and the longer the hang time, the farther the jump. In reality, this is difficult to achieve. Most long jumpers aim for a quick approach, a takeoff angle of 22 degrees, and a peak height of 1.5 meters above the ground during the jump. Excellent long jumpers need to have outstanding jumping ability and the explosive speed of sprinters. If Carl Lewis did not reduce his approach speed and could take off with the vertical speed of an excellent high jumper, he might exceed Beamon's world record by 1.40 meters.

High Jump: World record 2.43 meters, theoretical limit 2.56 meters
The high jump is a combination of strength coordination and the athlete's height. In the past 50 years, the world record has improved by 17 centimeters due to the increase in the jumper's jumping ability, the adoption of the Fosbury flop technique has improved the record by 10 centimeters, and the increase in the jumper's height has improved the record by 5 centimeters. Tall athletes with strong leg strength can expect to improve the current world record by another 12 centimeters.

　　人类运动能力极限再探
    近４年来，差不多７０％的男子游泳和田径世界纪录被刷新，这使人们老话重提，再次试图弄清这样一个问题：世界新纪录会永远不间断地出现吗？人类运动能力的极限到底在哪里？
    美国别希里瓦大学的专家卡瓦诺夫说：“一百年前，世界上最优秀的短跑运动员为了生计还要终日在帽厂里干活。现在广大田径运动的爱好者已不需要为生活所迫而从事繁重的体力劳动了。卡尔·刘易斯在荣获第２３届奥运会四枚金牌后，一下就得到了２５万美元。”显然，发达的经济和良好的社会环境有利于运动员把人类的运动能力挖掘到最高限度。
    专家们认为，科学技术的进步对形成合理的运动技术和提高运动成绩起着重要作用，并影响到人类运动能力最终极限的产生。这些年来，大部分世界纪录是由于改进技术动作和不断完善运动器材及辅助设施取得的，而不是依靠极少数运动天才。美国科研工作者阿里艾里分析欧文斯１９３６年在柏林奥运会上比赛时的电影资料后，得出这样的结论：如果使用塑胶跑道、穿上现代优质跑鞋和使用起跑器，欧文斯的百米成绩可以在１０秒３的基础上提高０．４秒，这个成绩足可以获得１９６８年墨西哥奥运会的金牌。世界男子马拉松跑的最好成绩提高２５分钟用了整整７５年，而女子只用了１５年。现在女子游泳世界纪录的水平已有一半可以夺取墨西哥奥运会男子游泳的金牌。由铝杆改为玻璃纤维杆后，撑杆跳高的世界纪录提高了近６０厘米。运动技术改进的作用在跳高中的表现尤为明显。由于墨西哥奥运会金牌得主福斯贝里完成了跳高技术的革命，世界纪录已提高了１０厘米，至今背越式仍是最优越的跳高技术。
    科学家们微观和深入研究发现，许多运动项目成绩的极限取决于物理学和生物学的规律。短跑运动员的速度受决定肢体运动速度的肌肉及肌肉细胞结构的影响。中距离赛跑的成绩取决于有效地利用氧气的能力，以保证下肢所需能量。长跑运动员的耐力则要看能否以最佳方式合理分配赛前积蓄在体内的能量储备。人类运动能力的极限在于骨骼和肌腱到底能承受住多大的张力，肌肉最终收缩得有多快，需要多少能量才能使机体最有效地工作。
    美国科学家拉里夫·曼一个图一个图地分析了几十名优秀短跑运动员比赛时的技术动作，把他们手臂、腿和躯干等各部分的技术数据一一输入电脑。依据运算结果，列出了决定短跑速度的１５个因素，找到了“最理想的短跑运动员”模式，就此推断出未来男子百米的极限成绩是９．５８秒。拉里夫·曼说，能超过这个成绩的运动员永远不会出现。他说，如果格里菲斯·乔伊纳没有退役，她只要采用超强度训练法，进一步提高身体训练水平，可能在１０秒４９的基础上再提高０．２７秒。
    科学家对男子田径几个跳跃项目极限成绩作出如下分析和预测：
    撑杆跳高　世界纪录６米０６，理论极限７米８２
    撑杆的制作技术已成为成绩增长的决定性因素。玻璃纤维就像是一个弹射器，可以把运动员从助跑到起跳时积蓄起来的能量一下子弹射到高空。但终究有一部分能量在杆子的摩擦和震荡中消耗掉了。如果研制出新的材料，成绩还会提高。但即使最理想的撑杆也不会再把目前的世界纪录提高１米８０以上。
    跳远　世界纪录８米９０，理论极限１０米３４
    助跑越快，起跳越高，滞空时间越长，就会跳得越远。实际上，这是难以做到的。大部分跳远运动员所追求的是尽快地助跑，起跳角度为２２°，腾空时最高身体重心离地面１．５米。优秀跳远运动员要具有出色的弹跳力和短跑运动员的爆发速度。如果卡尔·刘易斯不降低助跑速度而能以优秀跳高运动员那样的垂直速度起跳，那他可能超过比蒙的世界纪录１米４０以上。
    跳高　世界纪录２米４３，理论极限２米５６
    跳高是力量的协调和运动员身高诸方面的有机结合。最近５０年，世界纪录由于运动员弹跳力的增加，成绩提高了１７厘米，运动员采用了身体重心最靠近横杆的背越式使成绩提高了１０厘米，运动员身高的增加使成绩提高了５厘米。身材高而腿部力量大的运动员，可望把目前的世界纪录再提高１２厘米。
