In recent years, with the development of higher education, especially graduate education, and the rise of socialist commodity economy and the adjustment of industrial structure, the proportion of science graduates from universities entering industrial enterprises for production, technical, and management work has been increasing year by year. This new trend presents new requirements and challenges to higher science education, and has also brought about some new contradictions and problems. Last summer, we at Nanjing University organized a team to investigate the use of science talents in industrial enterprises in Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Yancheng. We collected various opinions, which are quite representative. Other universities and relevant departments of the State Education Commission have also conducted similar investigations. Overall, whether it is the institutions that cultivate science talents, the employing units, or the graduates themselves, there is a lack of sufficient psychological preparation, and there are many vague and one-sided understandings. For example, a leader from a certain city's planning commission said, "Science talents are indeed important to the country, but in our grassroots cities and counties, we neither develop atomic bombs nor satellites. What do we need so many science talents for?" The director of a certain medium-sized factory in Nanjing was even more frank: "I need talents who can be immediately useful and create value. Science graduates, after being assigned, cannot show economic benefits in three to five years, which is not worth it!" A considerable number of employing units keep their distance from science graduates, fearing that they are not as useful as engineering graduates, only talk big, and are unwilling or unable to do practical work; they fear that they will not be content with their jobs and may become "flying pigeons." Many science graduates assigned to factories also feel that they are "both underutilized and mismatched," using their weaknesses rather than their strengths, and are "a makeshift measure out of necessity."

How should we correctly view the new trend of science graduates entering industrial enterprises? How should science graduates correctly understand their own strengths and weaknesses, and thus find new areas to excel? How should industrial enterprises discard traditional concepts and correctly understand the connotation of today's science education, and thus appropriately and scientifically use science talents? How should universities improve science education to adapt to the new changes in society's demand for talents? All these issues urgently need us to seriously and deeply explore and give practical answers.

In the 1950s and 1960s, China had not yet established a degree system, and the scale of graduate education was small. Scientific researchers and university faculty were mainly supplemented by undergraduate graduates. Therefore, for a long period, China's science undergraduates, especially those from key universities, mainly went to research institutions and universities. Although some went to industrial enterprises, the proportion was very small. With the establishment and development of China's degree system, masters and doctors gradually replaced science bachelors as the main "supply source" for university faculty and research teams. The proportion of science bachelors entering non-teaching and non-research departments has correspondingly increased significantly.

Research data from developed countries tells us that with the commercialization, socialization, and modernization of production, science talents will increasingly enter production and technical departments. Their "entry" has greatly promoted the combination of science and technology, shortened the cycle of scientific and technological transformation into productive forces, and significantly improved the modernization level and economic benefits of production. For example, statistics from the 1979-1980 academic year in the United States show that more than half of science talents are distributed in the industrial sector, while in the 1985-1986 academic year in Japan, 59.2% of science bachelors engaged in specialized technical professions. Although China's commodity economy is not yet developed, traditional industries still exist in large numbers, and industrial enterprises cannot absorb science talents in large numbers in the short term like the economically developed countries such as the United States and Japan. However, in order to accelerate China's modernization process, transform and adjust the traditional industrial structure, and develop high-tech industries, the proportion of science talents entering industrial enterprises to engage in applied research, technical work, and production management must gradually increase year by year.

Can science talents adapt to industrial enterprises? Do they have a place to excel? This is the key issue that many employing units and graduates are hesitant about.

A large number of facts show that science talents, especially graduates from key universities, can quickly adapt to production, technical, and management work, and some can even become outstanding business or leadership backbones in industrial enterprises. According to our school's investigation of Jiangsu's four cities last year, among the science graduates assigned to industrial enterprises and other non-teaching and non-research units before and after the Cultural Revolution, 97.6% adapted or basically adapted, and only 2.4% did not adapt.

Compared with other types of professional talents, science talents have the advantages of a solid foundation, a broad knowledge base, and strong scientific thinking and innovation abilities. They are eager to explore the unknown world and are often not satisfied with just knowing the "what" but also seek to know the "why." This is the advantage and strength of science talents. However, compared with engineering graduates, they also have some shortcomings, such as insufficient training in specialized skills and weaker hands-on abilities in certain aspects.

However, actual investigations tell us that the fundamental problem lies in whether science graduates have the correct understanding and sufficient psychological preparation for working in industrial enterprises. If they think that being assigned to a factory is "overqualified" and "mismatched," then it will be difficult for them to settle down and "get into the role." Their original advantages will be lost, and they may even become unwelcome people, ultimately achieving nothing. If they have adequate mental preparation and can face reality, acknowledge their shortcomings, and quickly make up for them, then they will not only be able to quickly "get to work" and adapt to the work environment but also be able to fully play the advantages and strengths of science talents, create new situations, and achieve something.

For example, Zhao Wenjuan, a 1966 graduate of the Chemistry Department of Nanjing University, was assigned to work at the Xuzhou Synthetic Detergent Factory. She used her theoretical knowledge and professional skills to successfully develop new products such as composite formula detergent, winning the National Science and Technology Progress Third Prize, making the factory's economic benefits rank first in the industry nationwide. Zhao Wenjuan is now the deputy chief engineer and was elected as a member of the Seventh National People's Congress. Another example is Zhuang Huorong, the chief engineer of our school's biochemistry factory, a 1965 graduate of the biochemistry department. In late 1978, he went to work at the newly established biochemistry factory. In 10 years of hard work, he continuously introduced advanced foreign technologies, innovated processes and equipment, and successively improved the crude purification technology of urokinase, developed new products such as HMG (pituitary gonadotropin), HCG (pure chorionic gonadotropin), and UTI, turning a small factory with only 18 regular employees into a high-tech, export-oriented enterprise with an annual output value of 24 million yuan and an annual foreign exchange earnings of over 4 million US dollars. Last year, he won the Gold Award for the National First Entrepreneurial Science and Technology Business Award.

Industrial enterprises must boldly absorb and correctly use science talents, and must change the mindset of simply considering "professional matching." They must also change some traditional concepts that confine people's thoughts and obscure their vision. Generally, these traditional concepts include the following:

First, "Science is 'mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology,' it is about basic and theoretical research."

In 1952, when China's higher education institutions began to set up specialties, science indeed mainly referred to the six basic disciplines of mathematics, physics, chemistry, astronomy, geology, and biology. However, after more than 30 years of development, especially the past 10 years of reform, the number of science specialties has expanded from 16 in early 1953 to 14 categories and more than 70 specialties. The connotation of science education has also changed greatly, and in addition to some basic disciplines, some new disciplines with stronger applied and technical characteristics have been established.

Second, "Being assigned to a factory means being immediately useful and creating value."

This statement is not without reason, but if the understanding of "useful" and "creating value" is too narrow, it is difficult to avoid short-sighted behavior. The selection of talents should focus on their ideological qualities (sense of duty, responsibility, professional ethics, etc.), knowledge base, and work abilities, rather than overly emphasizing "professional matching." With the establishment of the competition mechanism and the development of science and technology, product updates, technology introduction and digestion, process reform and innovation, etc., will become increasingly important. What can give enterprises strong vitality and competitiveness, and create greater value for enterprises, will be the talents' innovation, adaptability, and pioneering abilities, rather than a specific professional technology. It is precisely in these aspects that science talents can excel in industrial enterprises.

Third, "Science talents are not as useful as engineering talents."

Engineering graduates have their strengths, but they also have their weaknesses, just as science talents have their "strong points" and "weak points." Industrial enterprises should know how to use people well and make the most of their strengths while avoiding their weaknesses. It is completely necessary to criticize the shortcomings of some science graduates who are light on practice and heavy on theory, have high expectations but low skills, and are prone to unrealistic ambitions. However, ignoring the characteristics of science talents and completely using the standards of engineering graduates or even skilled technical workers to require and evaluate them is obviously inappropriate and unscientific.

On the other hand, the prosperity and development of an enterprise largely depend on the optimization of the workforce and the reasonable structure of talents. Having a "uniform color" and only introducing talents of the same type is definitely harmful to the development of the enterprise. Of course, science talents must be combined with other types of talents, especially engineering and technical talents, in a reasonably structured and united team of talents, in order to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses and achieve mutual benefits.

For higher education institutions, fully recognizing the new trend of science talents working in industrial enterprises will enhance the urgency and initiative of reforming science education.

Undoubtedly, cultivating science talents for basic research and teaching work, and reserving strength to keep up with the development of world high-tech and face the challenges and competitions of the next century, remains an important task for science education, especially for key universities. However, this type of talent should be few but excellent. A large number of science undergraduates should be application-oriented talents for socialist modernization construction.

We must admit that our current science education still has many shortcomings, and our science graduates have their weaknesses. We must face these problems. These shortcomings and weaknesses can mostly be corrected and supplemented through reform. For example, for most application-oriented talents, we should increase the content of applied, technical, and even some engineering-type courses, strengthen the training of basic skills, and give students more opportunities to contact reality and engage in practice, so as to shorten the adaptation period in future industrial enterprises, etc.

In summary, science graduates working in industrial enterprises, combining theory with practice, basics with application, science with technology, is a meaningful and promising endeavor. To adapt to this historical necessity, higher science education should further deepen its reforms. There is still much to be done. Due to space limitations, we will not expand on this discussion here.

　　理科毕业生去工矿企业大有作为
    南京大学校长  曲钦岳
    一
    近年来，随着高等教育特别是研究生教育的发展，随着社会主义商品经济的兴起和产业结构的调整，我国理科本科毕业生进入工矿企业从事生产、技术和管理工作的比重逐年增加。这一新趋势对高等理科教育提出了新的要求和挑战，也产生了一些新的矛盾和问题。去年夏天，我们南京大学组织力量对南京、常州、无锡、盐城四市工矿企业的理科人才使用情况作了专门调查，收集到各种反映意见，颇具代表性。其他高校和国家教委有关部门也作了类似的调查。从总体上看，不管是理科人才培养单位，还是用人单位，或者毕业生自身，对此缺乏足够的心理准备，而且有许多模糊、片面的认识。比如，某市计委一领导干部说：“理科人才对国家来说确实重要，但我们基层市县，一不搞原子弹，二不搞卫星，要那么多理科人才干什么？”南京某中型工厂厂长说得更坦率：“我要的是一来就能顶用、就能创造价值的人才。理科学生分来，三五年内见不了经济效益，划不来！”相当一部分用人单位对理科毕业生“敬而远之”，怕他们不如工科人才管用，只会高谈阔论，不会或者不愿干实际工作；怕他们不安心本职工作，弄不好就成了“飞鸽牌”。而分到工厂去的理科毕业生也有不少人自认是“既屈才又不对口”，是“舍其长而用其短”，是“不得已而为之的权宜之计”。
    如何正确看待理科毕业生去工矿企业的新流向？理科毕业生如何正确认识自身的长短、强弱，从而找到新的用武之地？工矿企业用人单位如何摒弃传统观念，正确理解今日之理科教育的内涵，从而恰当地、科学地使用理科人才？高校又如何改进理科教育以适应社会对人才需求的新的变化？所有这些，亟待我们认真、深入地探讨并作出实事求是的回答。
    二
    在五六十年代，我国尚未建立学位制度，研究生教育的规模甚小，科研人员和高校师资主要靠本科毕业生来补充更新。因而在相当长的一个时期内，我国理科本科毕业生，特别是重点高校的理科毕业生，主要的去向是科研机构与高等学校，分到工矿企业的虽然也有，但比例很小。随着我国学位制度的建立与发展，硕士、博士逐步取代理科学士成为高校师资及科研队伍的主要“补给源”。理科学士进入非教学、科研部门工作的比重则相应有了明显的增加。
    发达国家的研究资料告诉我们，随着生产的商品化、社会化和现代化程度的提高，理科人才将越来越多地进入生产、技术部门。他们的“进入”，有力地促进了科学与技术的结合，缩短了科学技术转化为生产力的周期，大幅度提高了生产的现代化程度和经济效益。比如，美国１９７９—１９８０学年度的统计表明，半数以上的理科人才分布在工业部门，而日本１９８５—１９８６学年度的理科学士有５９．２％从事专门的技术性的职业。尽管我国的商品经济尚不发达，传统产业还大量存在，工矿企业在近期内尚不可能像美国、日本等经济发达国家那样大量吸收理科人才。但是，为了加快我国现代化进程，改造与调整传统产业结构，发展高新技术产业，理科人才进入工矿企业从事应用开发研究、技术工作与生产管理的比重必须逐年有所增加。
    三
    理科人才到工矿企业能否适应？有无用武之地？这是众多的用人单位和毕业生疑虑重重、举棋不定的关键问题。
    大量事实表明，理科人才，特别是重点高校的理科毕业生，是能够较快地适应生产、技术、管理工作的，有的还可以成为工矿企业的优秀业务骨干或领导骨干。根据我校去年对江苏四市的调查，“文革”前后南京大学分到工矿企业和其他非教学、科研单位工作的理科毕业生中，适应与基本适应的占９７．６％，不适应的仅占２．４％。
    同其他科类的专门人才相比，理科人才具有基础扎实、知识面较宽、科学思维和创新能力较强等特点。他们勇于探求未知世界，往往不满足于知其然，还渴求知其所以然。这是理科人才的优势和长处。然而，同工科毕业生相比，他们也有一些不足，比如专门技能的训练不够，在某些方面的动手能力不强等等。
    但是，实际调查告诉我们，根本问题在于理科毕业生对到工矿企业去工作是否有正确的认识和足够的心理准备。如果认为分到工厂是“大材小用”，是“不对口”，那么，就很难安下心来，“进入角色”，原来的优势也会丧失殆尽，甚至变成不受欢迎的人，最终一事无成。如果他们有充分的思想准备，并能面对实际，正视不足，尽快地加以弥补，那么，就不但能够很快“上手”，适应工作环境，而且能够充分发挥理科人才的特长和优势，开创新局面，干出一番事业来。
    比如，南京大学６６届化学系毕业生赵文娟，分配到徐州合成洗涤剂总厂工作，她运用所学的理论与专业知识，研制成功复合配方洗衣粉等新产品，获国家科技进步三等奖，使该厂经济效益在全国同行业中名列前茅，赵文娟现任副总工程师，当选为七届全国人大代表。又如我校生化厂总工程师庄火荣，是生化专业６５届毕业生，１９７８年底到创办不久的生化厂工作。１０年中艰苦创业，“尿里淘金”，不断引进国外先进技术，革新工艺、设备，先后改进了尿激酶粗品提纯技术，开发了ＨＭＧ（垂体促性腺激素）、ＨＣＧ（纯毛膜促性腺激素）和ＵＴＩ等新产品，使一个只有１８名正式职工的小厂，发展为技工贸结合，年产值２４００万元，年创汇４００余万美元的外向型、高技术企业。去年他荣获全国首届科技实业家创业奖金奖。
    四
    工矿企业要大胆吸收、正确使用理科人才，必须改变单纯考虑“专业对口”的思维定势，必须变革某些禁锢人们思想，遮蔽人们视野的传统观念。概括起来，这些传统观念大致有以下几种。
    其一曰：理科就是“数理化天地生”，就是搞基础，搞理论。
    １９５２年我国高等学校开始设置专业时，所谓理科确实主要是指数学、物理学、化学、天文学、地学和生物学这六大基础学科。但是，经过三十多年的发展，特别是近十年的改革，理科专业的数量已由１９５３年初的１６种扩展为１４门类７０余种。理科教育的内涵也有了很大变化，除了一些基础学科外，还建立了一些应用性、技术性较强的新学科。
    其二曰：“分到工厂就要能顶用，能创造价值”。
    这话不无道理，但如果对“顶用”和“创造价值”的理解过于狭窄，就很难避免急功近利的短期行为。对人才的选用，应注重其思想素质（事业心、责任感、职业道德等）、知识基础、工作能力等，而不应过分强调“专业对口”。随着竞争机制的建立与科学技术的发展，产品的更新换代，技术的引进、消化，工艺的改革与创新等，将越来越重要。能赋予企业以强大活力与竞争能力的，能够为企业创造更大价值的，将是人才的创新、应变、开拓能力，而不是某项具体的专门技术。正是在这些方面，理科人才在工矿企业可以大有作为。
    其三曰：“理科人才不如工科人才好使。”
    工科毕业生有其高明之处，但也有其不足之点，正如理科人才有其“强项”与“弱项”一样。工矿企业要知人善任，尽可能用其长而避其短。对部分理科毕业生轻实践而重理论、眼高手低、好高骛远等缺点提出尖锐的批评，是完全必要的。但是，忽视理科人才的特点，完全以工科人才甚至以熟练技术工人的标准来要求他们，衡量他们，显然也是不妥当、不科学的。
    另一方面，企业的兴旺发达，很大程度上取决于职工队伍的优化与人才结构的合理。搞“清一色”，只引进同一类型的人才，对企业的发展肯定是有害无益的。当然，理科人才必须与其他科类特别是工程技术人才相结合，在一个结构合理、团结奋进的人才群体中，方能扬长补短，相得益彰。
    五
    对于高等学校来说，充分认识理科人才去工矿企业工作的新趋势，将会增强改革理科教育的紧迫感与主动性。
    毫无疑问，培养从事基础研究和教学工作的理科人才，为跟踪世界高新技术发展，迎接下一世纪的竞争与挑战而储备力量，仍然是理科教育，特别是重点高校理科教育的重要任务。但是，这种人才要少而精。大量的理科本科毕业生，应当是面向社会主义现代化建设的应用型人才。
    应当承认，我们目前的理科教育还有许多缺陷，我们的理科毕业生有其不足之处。应当正视这些问题。这些缺陷与不足，大都是可以通过改革以纠正、弥补的。比如，对大多数应用型人才，要增加应用型技术型甚至某些工程型课程内容，要加强基本技能的训练，要让学生有更多的机会接触实际，投身实践，以缩短将来在工矿企业的适应期等等。
    总之，理科毕业生到工矿企业去工作，把理论与实践、基础与应用、科学与技术结合起来，是意义深远、大有希望的事业。为顺应这一历史必然，高等理科教育应当如何深化改革，还大有文章可做。限于篇幅，这里就不展开讨论了。
