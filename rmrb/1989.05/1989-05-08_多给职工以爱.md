More Love for the Workers

Zhang Baohua
Director, Hunan Huaihua Railway Bureau

Comrade, you asked about our experience in winning the "Golden Horse Award"? There's a lot to say. It's been sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy. After serving as the bureau director for five years, I've found that the most troublesome yet most lovable thing is our 30,000 workers.

In 1985, my second year as bureau director, the coastal economic special zones were in full swing with reforms, and they were recruiting talent from all over. Our bureau had 4,500 people applying to transfer out. Being a bureau director at that time was no easy task. People came with letters of recommendation, gifts, curses, and even followed me home to plead their cases. It was quite a headache.

Freezing personnel movements wasn't the solution. A forced match doesn't make for a sweet melon. Besides, in an era of reform, can you really "freeze" anything? Several of our technicians left without even taking their personnel files or household registrations. It was also difficult to do ideological work. Once, when I was lecturing the workers on the importance of staying rooted in the mountains, a young man stood up and shouted, "You leaders always talk about loving the mountains and the bureau, but is this place really worth loving?"

His words struck a chord with me. I started thinking about what responsibilities leaders have when workers want to leave.

That autumn, the bureau's Party Secretary, Zhang Zhenxing, spent half a month living at a small station along the line. Once, on the Jiaolu Railway, a worker pulled him to the edge of a small river about 20 meters wide and said, "Across the river is a primary school. Usually, the kids wade across or hop over the stones, but during the spring floods, even adults can't cross. We've accepted our fate of living in the mountains and can endure any hardship, but we just hope the leaders can build a bridge so the kids won't be delayed." These situations were reported to the leadership, and I didn't know what to say. Comrade, if you had a family living here for a lifetime, would you "wholeheartedly ensure safety and strive to improve transportation"?

Frequent visits to the grassroots level made me see and think a lot. I deeply felt that stabilizing the workforce and mobilizing the workers' enthusiasm and creativity starts with leaders showing more love to the workers.

Combining reasoning with solving practical problems. After more than ten years of effort (including the efforts of previous bureau leaders), now, the water and electricity problems along the line have been basically solved, and more than 90% of the stations have televisions and refrigerators. The bureau has a gas station, swimming pool, hospital, school, etc., all fully equipped. The rest rooms for locomotive crew members and the dispatching office are also equipped with 85 air conditioners.

Increasing the enterprise's cohesion isn't just about material conditions. Nowadays, people pay more attention to the spiritual environment. Leaders need to have a human touch. Our bureau has difficulties in finding jobs for girls. Once, to find a local factory to hire a few girls, the bureau's Party Secretary, Zhang Zhenxing, went out in the morning despite being ill and was sent back by an ambulance in the evening.

Another time, a female worker was diagnosed with leukemia and urgently needed a blood transfusion. The bureau's office broadcasted the call, and more than 100 people, including me, went to the hospital.

For the more than 4,500 people who wanted to transfer out, we didn't use a one-size-fits-all approach. For those with genuine difficulties, such as long-term separation from spouses, we not only agreed to their transfers but also helped them. I always think that if the enterprise is well-managed, why worry about not having people? Since 1985, while building the enterprise, we have also adjusted the workforce, with people coming and going. The number of people transferred in is more than 100 people than those transferred out, including 150 college graduates with various technical titles. The "Flying Pigeon" brand left, and the "Forever" brand came in, making the workforce much more stable.

Love is mutual. Leaders should avoid too much special treatment and do more practical things for the workers. Don't be afraid of lacking funds, as long as you put your heart into it, the workers will love the enterprise and put their strength into their work without needing mobilization. In recent years, the bureau's turnover rate has increased by an average of 23.0% per year, and the labor productivity of the entire transportation sector has increased by an average of 21.5% per year. Other major economic and technological indicators are also at the advanced level of similar enterprises on the entire line. The bureau has been awarded the title of National Advanced Enterprise in Ideological and Political Work, a Grade-II National Enterprise, and the "Golden Horse Award." Can a few cadres alone achieve this? The credit goes to the 30,000 workers. Therefore, our main experience in enterprise management is to insist on putting people first and showing more love to the workers.

### 多给职工以爱

　　多给职工以爱
    湖南怀化铁路分局局长  张保华
    同志，您问我们得“金马奖”有什么体会？多呢。酸甜苦辣都有。当了五年分局长，感到最伤脑筋又最可爱的就是我们那三万职工。
    １９８５年，也是我当分局长的第二年。沿海经济特区改革搞得热火朝天，四处招聘人才。分局有４５００多人写报告要求“流动”。那时的局长可不好当，交条子的、送礼的、骂娘的、从办公室跟到家里“磨”的，什么都有。够烦的。
    搞“人事冻结”不是办法。强扭的瓜不甜。何况，改革年代你“冻结”得了吗？我们好几个技术员档案户口全不要，走了。思想教育工作也不好做，一次我给职工讲扎根山区的道理，一个小伙子站起来高声说：“你们当头的整天说要爱山区爱分局，可这儿值得爱吗？”这句话给我震动很大，我琢磨着当领导的对“人心思走”应负什么责任。
    那年秋季，分局党委书记张振兴同志到沿线小站去住了半个月。一次，在焦柳铁路上一个工人把他拉到一条约２０米宽的小河边，说，“河对面是小学校，平时娃儿们扎起裤腿或踩着石头过，可春季发水连大人也过不去。我们这一辈认了钻山沟的命，啥苦都能吃，只求领导给修座桥，别误了娃儿。”这些情况反映到领导班子中，我说不出是啥滋味。同志，摊上您一家在这儿猫一辈子，您会“一心一意保安全，千方百计搞运输”吗？
    常在基层跑，看得多，想得也特多。深切感到，稳定职工队伍，调动好职工的积极性和创造性，首先是领导要多给职工以爱。
    把讲道理和解决实际困难结合起来。经过十来年的努力（包括前任局领导的努力），现在，沿线站区吃水难、用电难的问题基本解决，９０％以上的站区有电视、冰箱。分局有煤气站、游泳池、医院、学校，等等，全部配套。机车乘务员的休息室和调度所还装了８５台空调机。
    增加企业凝聚力也不全靠物质条件。现在人们更看重精神环境。当领导的要有人情味才行。咱们分局女孩就业难。一次，为了找一个地方厂招几个女孩子，分局党委书记张振兴同志早上抱病出去，晚上救护车送回来。
    还有一次，一位女工得白血病急需输血。分局机关的广播一响，包括我在内到医院去了１００多人。
    对那４５００多想调走的人，我们也不是一刀切。像夫妻长期分居等确有实际困难的，不但同意走，还为他帮忙。我总是想，企业办好了，还怕没人来？１９８５年以来，我们一边建设企业，一边调整队伍，有进有出，调进的比调出的还多１００多人，其中包括调进１５０名有各种技术职称的大中专生。走的“飞鸽”牌，进的是“永久”型，队伍稳定多了。
    爱是互相的。当领导的少搞点特殊化，多为职工办几件实事，不怕资金少，只要尽心尽力，不用动员，工人就会爱企业，有劲就会往工作上使。这几年，分局换算周转量年均递增２３．０％，运输全员劳动生产率年均递增２１．５％，其他主要经济技术指标也处于全路同企业先进水平，分局先后被评为全国思想政治工作优秀企业、国家二级企业并得“金马奖”，单靠几个干部行吗？功劳在三万职工。所以说，我们在企业管理中的一条主要体会是，坚持以人为中心，多给职工以爱。
