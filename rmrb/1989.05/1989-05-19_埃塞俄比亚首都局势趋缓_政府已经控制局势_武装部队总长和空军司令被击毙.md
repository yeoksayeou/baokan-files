	Ethiopia's capital city, Addis Ababa, saw a easing of tensions last night after President Mengistu returned from a visit to East Germany.

	Workers and government employees began going to work today, and shops reopened. However, the airport is still awaiting government orders to reopen.

	According to official sources, the coup attempt occurred during a military meeting held just a few hours after Mengistu's departure for East Germany on the afternoon of the 16th. The coup was led by the Chief of the General Staff, Merid Negassi, and the Air Force Commander, Amha Desalegn, both of whom were killed. Some other generals who supported the coup surrendered. Unconfirmed reports suggest that Defense Minister Haile Zigi Habte Mariam was also killed in the fighting to defend the government. The Minister of Industry, Fantaye Belay, was arrested on charges of involvement in the coup plot on the 18th at the Ministry of Defense.

	Belay was found hiding in the sewers of the Ministry of Defense. Before taking on his civilian role, Belay served as the Air Force Commander and held the rank of Major General.

	It is believed that the coup was a result of serious disagreements among the generals over the government's handling of issues in the northern regions of Eritrea and Tigray.

	Meanwhile, Ethiopian diplomatic personnel in Nairobi reported that the government has regained control of the situation.

	However, on the 17th, intense gunfire and artillery exchanges still occurred in Addis Ababa.

	Additionally, reliable sources indicate that the coup forces have occupied at least the northern province of Eritrea's capital, Asmara. They are broadcasting via the radio station there and have received support from another anti-government armed group, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front. They also claimed over the radio that the Mengistu government has been overthrown.

　　埃塞俄比亚首都局势趋缓    
    政府已经控制局势
    武装部队总长和空军司令被击毙
    新华社亚的斯亚贝巴５月１８日电（记者陈进军）埃塞俄比亚总统门格斯图１７日晚上中止对民主德国的访问回国后，埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴的紧张局势开始缓和。
    工人和政府雇员今天开始上班，商店恢复营业。但是机场仍等待政府重新开放的命令。
    据官方的材料，这次政变是在１６日下午门格斯图离开这里前往民主德国仅几小时后召开的一次军事会议上发生的。发动政变的武装部队总参谋长默里德·尼古西和空军司令阿姆哈·德斯塔被打死。一些支持政变其他将军投降。据未经证实的报道，国防部长海尔—齐吉斯·哈普特—马里亚姆也在保卫政府的交战中被打死。工业部长范塔·贝莱因被指控参与了此次政变阴谋１８日在国防部被捕。
    贝莱是藏在国防部的下水道中被发现的。贝莱在担任文职之前为空军司令，授以少将军衔。
    人们认为，这次政变是将军们对政府处理北部厄立特里亚和提格雷地区问题存在严重分歧造成的。
    另据报道，埃塞俄比亚驻内罗毕外交人员说，政府已经控制了局势。
    但１７日，在亚的斯亚贝巴仍发生了激烈的枪炮战。
    此外据可靠消息说，政变部队至少占据了埃北部省份厄立特里亚首府阿斯马拉。他们正通过那里的电台播音，并得到了另一支反政府武装厄立特里亚人民解放阵线的支持。他们还通过电台宣称门格斯图政府已被推翻。
