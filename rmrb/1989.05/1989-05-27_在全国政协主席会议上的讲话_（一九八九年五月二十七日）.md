Speech at the Chairman's Meeting of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(May 27, 1989)
Li Xiannian

I am very pleased to hear the speeches of all the vice-chairpersons. Recently, some members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and other individuals have written to me either jointly or individually, expressing various views and suggestions on the current domestic situation, especially in Beijing. They hope that the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference can play a role in maintaining the stability of the capital and the country. The letters from all of you, regardless of the specific opinions and suggestions, all express deep concern about the current chaotic situation and hope that the situation can be quickly calmed down. Some of you have made fair analyses of the situation and put forward very good suggestions. I attach great importance to these opinions and suggestions and have already conveyed them truthfully to the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

My feelings are the same as yours. I am already 80 years old. As an old soldier who has fought for half his life, as a participant in the great struggle to establish and build a new China, I am deeply loyal to the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Republic, which were won by the sacrifices of countless revolutionary martyrs. I am deeply concerned about the current chaotic situation. I am willing to work together with you to quickly reverse this situation.

The broad masses of young students have put forward demands to oppose "official profiteering," punish corruption, promote democracy, and hope for social progress and national prosperity, etc. Their wishes are good, and many of their demands are reasonable. Our work indeed has mistakes, our ranks indeed have corruption, and our democratic and legal construction indeed needs to be strengthened. The wishes and demands of the students are also the common wishes and demands of the broad masses of Communist Party members, various democratic parties, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life, and they are consistent with the goals of the Party and the government. The wishes and demands they express will play a certain role in helping the Party and the government correct mistakes and eliminate corruption, which is of positive significance. The Party and the people will not overlook this. For this reason, the Party and the government have solemnly announced and repeatedly emphasized that they must strictly distinguish the broad masses of young students from the very few people who deliberately create turmoil. For the students' certain extreme words and deeds, they will not pursue responsibility. Everyone should believe that the Party and the government's attitude is based on a correct assessment of the situation and is sincere. The broad masses of young students support the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party of China, apart from fighting for the interests of the people, has no special interests of its own. Our government is dedicated to serving the people wholeheartedly. We should firmly believe that the Party and the government have the ability and means to definitely take effective measures to solve the various existing problems. However, I think it is inappropriate and unacceptable to take the methods of striking, marching, demonstrating, hunger striking, and sitting in protest. Because these methods are not beneficial to the country, the people, or themselves, and do not help solve the problems, but will be used by a few people to create turmoil, leading to the opposite of the good wishes of the broad masses of young students. The development of the situation has completely proven this.

For a long time, the correct policy of adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping has not been well implemented, resulting in a certain degree of ideological confusion. Recently, a very few people have taken advantage of the good wishes of the broad masses of young students, the ideological confusion of some people, and certain mistakes in the Party and government's decisions and the corruption in our ranks, to plot behind the scenes, create rumors, incite and provoke, and arbitrarily expand the situation. They attempt to achieve their political goal of denying the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system through turmoil. Their activities are completely organized, planned, and premeditated. If their conspiracy succeeds, our country and nation will fall into deep disaster. All patriotic and conscientious citizens, including various democratic parties, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life, as well as the broad masses of young students, do not want to see this tragedy and will absolutely not allow it. The decision and series of measures to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation announced by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and the important speech by Chairman Yang Shangkun, are completely correct, and we should firmly support them. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's execution of the sacred martial law mission to stop the turmoil, maintain social order in the capital, and protect the interests of the people of the capital, including the broad masses of young students, is completely necessary, and we should firmly support it. The officers and soldiers executing the martial law mission, the armed police units maintaining social order in the capital, and the broad public security personnel have made great efforts and important contributions under extremely difficult conditions. We express our warm condolences and heartfelt thanks to them.

The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference has an unshirkable responsibility in this major struggle between right and wrong, in uniting people from all walks of life to assist the Party and the government in stopping the turmoil and maintaining stability and unity. I sincerely hope that all members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will put the overall situation first, understand and support the measures taken by the Party and the government. As for some members who have had different views on certain issues in the previous period and even now, they can exchange views through various means and gradually seek consensus in practice. Even if the understanding is not quite appropriate, it is completely understandable. Because many people do not know the true facts, an important reason for the current complex situation is that some individuals in the leadership of the Communist Party. For decades, the Communist Party has been through thick and thin with various democratic parties and patriotic people from all walks of life. The unity and cooperation between the Communist Party and various democratic parties and patriotic people from all walks of life can withstand any test. I am fully convinced that after they understand the true facts, they will definitely more resolutely support the decisions made by the Party and the government. I hope that all members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and comrades from various democratic parties will, through their own extensive contacts, help people from all walks of life, intellectuals, and the broad masses of young students to see the situation clearly, unite the people of all ethnic groups and all sectors, and jointly do a good job in stopping the turmoil and maintaining social stability. Only by achieving social stability can we ensure that China's socialist modernization construction and reform and opening-up cause proceed healthily along the correct path.

　　在全国政协主席会议上的讲话
    （一九八九年五月二十七日）
    李先念
    听了各位副主席的发言，我非常高兴。最近，有一些全国政协委员和其他人士联名或单独写信给我，就当前国内特别是北京的局势，提出了各种看法和建议，希望全国政协能够在维护首都和全国局势的稳定方面发挥作用。各位的来信，不论具体意见和建议如何，都对当前的混乱局面表示深深的忧虑，都希望事态能够很快平息，有的还对形势作了公正的分析，提出了很好的建议。我对这些意见和建议是十分重视的，并已如实地转达给党中央和国务院。
    我和大家的心情是一样的。我已经８０岁了。作为一个征战半生的老战士，作为一个为创建新中国和建设新中国伟大斗争的参加者，对于无数革命先烈的生命换来的共产党的领导和人民共和国，是无限忠诚的。对于当前的混乱局势，我不能不表示关切。我愿意同大家一道，为迅速扭转这种局面共同努力。
    广大青年学生提出反对“官倒”，惩治腐败，促进民主，希望社会进步、国家富强，等等，愿望是好的，他们的许多要求也是合理的。我们的工作中确实存在失误，我们的队伍中确实有腐败现象，我们的民主和法制建设确实需要加强，学生们的愿望和要求，也是我们广大共产党员、各民主党派、广大知识分子和各界人士的共同愿望和要求，同党和政府的目标是一致的。他们所表达的愿望和要求，对帮助党和政府纠正失误、清除腐败，会起一定的推动作用，这是有积极意义的，党和人民不会看不到这一点。正因为如此，党和政府才郑重宣布并且反复强调，要把广大青年学生同那些蓄意制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来，对学生们的某些过激言行，也一概不予追究。大家应该相信，党和政府的这种态度是基于对情况的正确估计，是真诚的。广大青年学生是拥护社会主义制度、拥护共产党的领导的。中国共产党除了为人民的利益而斗争以外，没有自己特殊的利益，我们的政府是全心全意为人民服务的，我们应该坚信党和政府有能力、有办法也一定会采取有力措施，解决存在的各种问题。但是，现在这种任意采取罢课、游行、示威、绝食、静坐请愿的方式，我认为是不妥当的，也是不赞成的。因为这些方式于国、于民、于他们自己都不利，也无助于问题的解决，而且会被极少数人所利用，造成动乱，走向广大青年学生善良愿望的反面。事态的发展已经完全证明了这一点。
    长期以来，邓小平同志提出的坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的正确方针，没有得到很好的贯彻执行，造成了一定程度的思想混乱。最近，极少数人利用广大青年学生的善良愿望，利用一些人的思想混乱，利用党和政府决策上的某些失误和我们队伍中的一些腐败现象，幕后策划，制造谣言，挑拨煽动，恣意扩大事态，企图通过动乱，达到他们否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度的政治目的。他们的活动完全是有组织、有计划、有预谋的。如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们的国家和民族就会陷入深重的灾难之中。一切爱国的、有良知的公民，包括各民主党派、广大知识分子和各界人士，也包括广大青年学生，都是不愿意看到这种悲剧的，也是绝对不会容许的。李鹏同志代表党中央和国务院宣布的制止动乱、稳定局势的决策和一系列措施，杨尚昆主席的重要讲话，是完全正确的，我们应当坚决拥护。中国人民解放军为制止动乱，维护首都的社会安定，保卫首都人民包括广大青年学生的利益，执行神圣的戒严任务，是完全必要的，我们应当坚决支持。执行戒严任务的全体官兵，维护首都社会秩序的武警部队和广大公安干警，在极端困难的条件下，做出了巨大的努力和重要的贡献，我们对他们表示亲切的慰问和衷心的感谢。
    政协在这场大是大非的政治斗争中，在团结各界人士协助党和政府制止动乱、维护安定团结的工作中，有义不容辞的责任。我真诚地希望各位政协委员，能以大局为重，理解、支持党和政府所采取的措施。至于有些委员在前一个时期以至现在对某些问题有不同的看法，可以通过各种方式交换意见，并在实践中逐步求得一致。即使认识不那么妥当，也是完全可以理解的。因为许多人并不了解事实真相，造成目前这种复杂局面的一个重要原因，是在我们共产党内部领导层的个别人。几十年来，共产党同各民主党派和各界爱国人士，一直是风雨同舟、患难与共的。共产党同各民主党派和各界爱国人士的团结与合作，是经得起任何考验的。我完全相信，在他们了解了事实的真相后，一定会更加坚决地拥护党和政府所作出的决策。我希望各位政协委员、各民主党派的同志能够通过各自广泛的联系，帮助各界人士、广大知识分子和广大青年学生认清形势，团结各族人民群众和各方面人士，共同做好制止动乱，维护社会安定的工作。只有实现了社会稳定，才可以使我国的社会主义现代化建设和改革、开放事业沿着正确的道路健康地向前发展。
