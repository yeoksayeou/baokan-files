After taking several significant steps, the agriculture in Shifang County, Sichuan Province, like many other places, has fallen into a new state of stagnation. Where is the way out?

In the autumn of 1987, the decision-makers of Shifang County, based on the county's actual situation of having a large population and limited land, relatively developed township enterprises, and relatively high per capita income in rural areas, proposed a new idea of trial implementation of the land leasing system, which was quickly put into practice.

"The 7-8 level prime ministers' decision": If it works, do it; if it doesn't, stop it.

From the central government down to the villages, village cadres often jokingly refer to themselves as the "troubled 7-8 level prime ministers" because they are at the focal point of the conflict between national interests and farmers' interests.

When the plan to implement the land leasing system was presented, they almost unanimously decided: if it works, do it; if it doesn't, stop it. The guiding ideology of the county Party committee and the county government is: start from reality and give full autonomy.

Jiang Huaiqi, the Party secretary of Longju Township, convened a village meeting to solicit opinions. Most of the farmers present supported the implementation of the land leasing system. The reason was simple: farmers who work outside do not want to be tied down to the land, while skilled farmers want to farm more land.

Jiang Huaiqi told the reporter: "Since September 1987, our township has implemented the 'two-field system,' allocating 0.3 mu of grain field to each farmer to ensure their basic living needs, and the rest of the land is fully leased. The state's grain procurement, agricultural tax, and collective levies are all borne by the leased land in the form of rent, with the rent per mu of land set between 70 and 100 yuan depending on its quality."

After implementing the land leasing system for a full year, what changes have occurred in Longju Township?

Jiang Huaiqi listed them: "One change is that completing the state's tasks is no longer a problem. In 1987, the entire township owed 80,000 yuan in agricultural tax and levies, and 114,000 kilograms of grain procurement was overdue. It's not that there was no grain or money, but farmers were unwilling to pay. After leasing the land, not only were the old debts cleared, but last year's state tasks were completed quickly and well, and there is no longer a need for cadres to go door-to-door to collect. Because if farmers do not pay the rent on time, they will not be able to lease the land again. Second, farmers' enthusiasm for farming has increased. In the past, some farmers who worked outside left their fields fallow, while skilled farmers wanted to farm more but had no land. Now, farmers' income from farming directly depends on the management effect of the land. Those who work outside naturally do not want to pay rent in vain, so they either farm well or let the land be leased to others. With the output benefits of the land, farmers' enthusiasm has increased. Third, the collective economy has been strengthened, making it easier to serve better. Fourth, the relationship between cadres and the masses has improved..."

For families that do not farm, how is the grain supply solved?

Luoshui Town's Luocheng Village did it this way. This village has 70 enterprises, and 89% of the village's labor force are workers. Many farmers are 'riding a double-headed horse,' both holding land (abandoned or extensively managed) and working. After implementing the lease, the entire village has 67 households that neither farm the grain field nor the leased land. The village adopts a grain price subsidy method for these people, calculating 12.5 kilograms of grain per person per month and subsidizing 60 yuan. Individuals are satisfied, and the collective can also afford it.

The village Party branch secretary, Zhong Rongli, revealed: "Last year, we collected 71,000 yuan in rent, paid the state 45,300 yuan, and the rest of the money was all used to increase agricultural investment. We built an orchard with 230,000 yuan, invested 3,000 laborers in agricultural infrastructure, and invested an average of 14.85 yuan per person. This year, we plan to increase the investment by another 400,000 yuan."

The implementation of the land leasing system is not a "military order." Bajiao Township is an exception. Township head Chen Weilu told the reporter, "The land leasing plan, once it met the farmers, everyone calculated and decided not to do it. Because our township is a mountainous area with more forests and less land, the operational level of large fields is not high, there is no state grain procurement task, and the contradiction is not in the arable land, so there is no need to change."

The county Party secretary, Lü Feng, commented on this township: "They started from reality and from the farmers' wishes, which is completely correct and cannot be forced. Our county has three townships that are not suitable for land leasing, and we all support them."

Farmers feel: the pressure is greater, but the motivation is sufficient.

After implementing the land leasing system, farmers face two choices: if they want to farm, they must farm well; if they want to work outside, they must farm less or not at all. The result is that farmers pay more attention to the management effect of the land in terms of economic benefits, and at the same time, the land gradually concentrates relatively and gradually towards skilled farmers.

Luo Cheng Village's 10th group farmer Liu Yixian's view on the leasing system is: "I am good at farming and have no other skills. In the past two years, I wanted to farm more but couldn't, and I could only manage 2.5 mu of responsibility land all year round. Last year, I farmed 6.5 mu of land, harvested 5,000 kilograms of grain, and the market price was worth 5,000 yuan. After deducting the input costs and paying the rent, I still had a net income of 4,000 yuan. I think this way of doing it is good, and I hope it won't change."

To lease land for farming, some villages with less land and more people have even seen bidding scenes. The reason is that farmers' calculations show: farming is profitable.

In this village's 10th group, Tang Minggang's home, the reporter and he together calculated last year's detailed accounts: his family of six, four working outside, one doing housework (raising livestock and poultry), and one farming. Last year, he leased a total of 4.8 mu of land, harvested 3,360 kilograms of grain in two seasons, and planted 1.8 mu of vegetables. The income from one person farming reached 3,097 yuan, and the input-output benefits were very obvious.

Those farmers who think they are not capable of farming or feel that farming is not as good as working outside have all left the land to work outside. Lingjie Township's Chitang Village, Wang Chaoyun and his wife, with a child, have been working outside for many years, and their responsibility land has been abandoned for a long time. After implementing the lease, he decisively let the land to skilled farmers. Throughout the county, there are 1,389 households like Wang Chaoyun who have made this choice.

The pressure on farmers to farm comes from: if they do not farm well, they will lose the qualification to lease the land.

The motivation for farmers to farm comes from: if they farm well, they will have a high economic income.

After Shifang County implemented the land leasing system for a year, it cannot be said that all the problems in the rural areas have been solved, but it undoubtedly injected a new vitality into the tired agricultural economy.

### 要种田就要种好田——记什邡县试行土地租赁制

　　要种田就要种好田
    ——记什邡县试行土地租赁制
    新华社记者  凌云
    在接连迈出几大步之后，四川省什邡县的农业，也和其他不少地方一样，陷入了新的徘徊。出路在哪里呢？
    １９８７年秋天，什邡县的决策者们，根据本县人多地少、乡镇工业较发达、农村人均收入较高的实际情况，提出了试行土地租赁制的新构想，并很快付诸实施。
  “七八级总理”的决断：灵则干，不灵则休
    从中央数到乡村，乡村干部便戏称自己是“苦恼的七八级总理”，因为他们处于国家利益和农民利益的矛盾焦点上。
    当实行土地租赁制的方案摆在面前时，他们几乎不约而同地打定主意：行之有效就干，不行则罢。而县委和县政府的指导思想是：从实际出发，给以充分的自主权。
    龙居乡党委书记江怀其，召开村民大会征求意见，到会的大多数农民都拥护实行土地租赁，原因很简单：务工的农民不愿被死死地捆在土地上，种田能手则希望多种田。
    江怀其告诉记者：“从１９８７年９月起，我们乡推行‘两田制’，给每位农民划分０．３亩的口粮田，以确保他们的基本生活，其余田全实行租赁。国家定购粮、农业税、集体提留，全以租金的方式由租赁田承担，每亩地的租金按好坏定在７０至１００元之间。”
    实行土地租赁制整整一年后的龙居乡，到底有什么变化呢？
    江怀其数落起来：“一个变化是完成国家任务没问题了。１９８７年，全乡共欠农业税、提留款８万元，欠定购粮１１．４万公斤，不是没粮食没钱，而是农民不愿交。土地租赁后，不仅还清了老账，去年完成国家任务又快又好，再也用不着干部挨家挨户去催了，因为农民若不按时交够租金，就不能再租种田了。二是农民种田积极性高了，过去一些务工农民把田撂荒，种田能手想多种又无田。现在农民种田收入的多少直接取决于土地的经营效果，务工者自然不愿白交租金，要么就种好田，要么就把土地让给别人租种，有了土地的产出效益，农民的积极性就高了。三是集体经济实力增强了，便于更好地服务。四是干群关系改善了……”
    不种田的人家，吃粮怎么解决呢？
    洛水镇的洛城村是这么办的。这个村有７０个企业，务工农民占了全村劳力的８９％，许多农民是“骑着双头马”，既占着地（撂荒或粗放经营），又务工。实行租赁后，全村有６７户既不种口粮田，也不种租赁田，村上对这部人采取口粮补差的办法，按人均每人每月１２．５公斤粮算价补给６０元。个人满意，集体也承受得起。
    村党总支书记钟荣礼亮了个底：“去年我们收租金７．１万元，交国家４．５３万元，其余的钱全用在增加农业投入上。用２．３万元建起一个果园，投入３０００个劳力搞农田基建，还按人头每人平均投入１４．８５元。今年我们打算再增加４万元的投入。”
    实行土地租赁制并非是“军令如山倒”。八角乡就是例外。乡长陈维禄告诉记者，“土地租赁制的方案，一与农民见面，大家一合计，就决定不搞。因为我们乡是山区，林多地少，大田的作业水平不高，没有国家的定购粮任务，矛盾不在耕地上，用不着改。”
    县委书记吕锋对这个乡的看法是：“他们从实际出发，从农民的意愿出发，是完全正确的，决不能蛮干。我们县有３个乡不适宜搞土地租赁，我们都支持。”
  农民的感觉是：压力大了，动力足了
    实行土地租赁后，农民面临着两种选择：要种田，就必须种好田；要务工，就必须少种田或不种田。其结果是促使农民在经济利益上更关心土地的经营效果，同时也使土地相对地、逐渐地向种田能手集中。
    洛城村１０组农民刘义贤对租赁制的看法是：“我这人就会种田，没别的本事。前两年我想多种田不行，终年围着２．５亩责任田能刨出个啥子来？去年我种６．５亩田，收粮食５０００公斤，按市场价算值５０００元，除去投入费用和缴纳租金外，还纯收入４０００元，我就想这个样子搞下去，莫变了。”
    为租种田，一些田少人多的乡村还出现了争投标的情景。原因是农民算帐的结果是：种田划算。
    在这个村１０组唐明刚家里，记者与他一起算了去年的细帐：他家６口人，４人务工，一人做家务（养家畜家禽），一人种田。去年他共租种４．８亩田，小春和大春两季收粮食３３６０公斤，种蔬菜１．８亩，一人种田的收入就达３０９７元，投入产出效益十分明显。
    那些自视无力种田或觉得种田不如务工的农民，便纷纷离土务工。灵杰乡池塘村王朝云夫妇，带着一个小孩常年在外做工，家里的责任田长期撂荒。实行租赁后，他果断地把田让给了种田能手，全县像王朝云这样抉择的有１３８９户。
    农民种田的压力来自：种不好田，就失去了继续租赁土地的资格。
    农民种田的动力来自：种好田，就有高的经济收入。
    什邡县试行土地租赁制一年，不能说农村中存在的问题都解决了，但它无疑给疲惫的农业经济注入了一股新的活力。
