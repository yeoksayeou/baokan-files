With the wheat harvest still a month away, the Yun Cheng region of Shanxi Province has taken steps to prepare for the summer grain procurement.

Yun Cheng is the largest grain-producing region in Shanxi Province, with annual wheat delivery quotas accounting for over 60% of the province's total. As early as when the wheat was just beginning to sprout, leaders at the prefecture and county levels led hundreds of officials into the countryside. They inspected the wheat fields and visited farmers' homes, addressing problems as they arose. For instance, in early May, when wheat aphids appeared, officials delivered pesticides to the farmers, quickly eradicating the pest. Additionally, during the critical irrigation period for wheat, some rural areas experienced unstable power supply. Officials worked with the electricity and related departments to resolve the issue, ensuring timely irrigation for the wheat fields. This way, the relationship between many farmers and officials became closer, and officials' words carried more weight in the countryside. Farmers said that after a bountiful wheat harvest this year, they would feel guilty if they did not deliver to the state. In May, the region announced the reward policy for grain-selling farmers early on, such as rewarding one ton of urea for every 5,000 kilograms of commercial grain delivered to the state, making the policy known to every household.

After completing the above work, the region worked hard to create satisfactory conditions for farmers to deliver their grain. In early May, the region held a meeting of grain department heads at the prefecture and county levels, stipulating that larger townships should have two or more grain procurement points, and smaller townships should have one, solving the problem of difficult grain sales. At the same time, it was required that hot water stations be set up at the procurement points to ensure that farmers could sell their grain promptly without waiting or thirst. The regional committee and the administrative office also required all grain departments to purchase grain inspection instruments, prohibiting the use of hands or eyes to inspect grain to avoid misjudging the quality and grade of the grain. The regional committee and the administrative office dispatched officials to various counties and townships to conduct on-site inspections and ensure implementation.

　　小麦未开镰　措施已落实
    运城提前做好夏粮收购准备
    据新华社太原电  （记者谈风、杨玉良）离小麦开镰收割还有一个月，山西省运城地区已采取措施，做好夏粮收购准备工作。
    运城地区是山西省最大的产粮区，每年小麦交售任务占全省６０％以上。早在今年小麦刚刚拔节的时候，地、县两级领导带领几百名干部就深入农村，一边到麦田察看，一边到农民家里访问，发现问题就解决。如５月初发生的小麦吸浆虫病，干部就把农药送到农民手里，迅速扑灭了病虫害。又如，在小麦正需灌溉浇水时，一些农村供电不正常，干部就找电力等有关部门研究解决，保证了麦田的及时浇灌。这样一来许多农民和干部的感情密切了，干部在农村说话顶事了。农民说今年小麦丰收后要不向国家交售，那可就昧良心了。进入５月份，地区把今年对售粮农民的奖励办法提早公布于众，如向国家交售５０００公斤商品粮奖售一吨尿素等，宣传得家喻户晓。
    以上这些工作做了之后，这个地区又努力为农民交售粮食创造满意的条件。５月初，地区召开了地县粮食部门的负责人会议，规定大的乡镇设两个以上购粮点，小的乡镇设一个购粮点，解决售粮难问题，同时要求在购粮点上都设立开水站，保证农民在交售粮食时随到随收，不累不渴。地委和行署还要求所有粮食部门都必须置办验粮仪器，不许用手用眼验粮，以免看错粮食的好坏等级，地委和行署派出干部到各县各乡镇进行实地检查落实情况。
