Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th.

In recent days, Beijing citizens and students have been visiting hospitals to comfort soldiers who were injured while on their way to Beijing to enforce martial law. Captain Wang Xiaoyi of a certain unit told reporters in his hospital room, "Beijing citizens have feelings for the People's Liberation Army. Our hearts are connected. Many misunderstandings are being cleared up."

These soldiers were admitted to the hospital on May 23rd. On the same day, civilians rushed to the hospital to comfort the soldiers. Since then, groups of officials and civilians have been visiting daily, each group consisting of dozens of people. Simple-minded old Beijing residents and frank-minded young students have had heart-to-heart talks with the soldiers, deepening their understanding. All members of the Communist Youth League branch of the Sixth Team of the Beijing Foreign Trade Needlework Import and Export Company visited the soldiers' bedsides, expressing their desire to learn from the People's Liberation Army and become good youth who love the Party, love socialism, and love the people. A middle-aged official from the State Planning Commission brought gifts and a letter from his mother. The letter said, "In stopping this turmoil, you were injured by a small group of hooligans and some people who did not understand the situation. As an old soldier of the Eighth Route Army, an old Party member, a retired cadre, and a Beijing citizen, I extend my sincere greetings to you. You are proving to the citizens of Beijing with your actions: the People's Liberation Army is the greatest army."

    慰问戒严部队受伤官兵
    新华社北京５月２９日电  连日来，北京市民和青年学生纷纷前往医院，慰问来北京执行戒严任务途中被打伤的官兵。某部上尉军官王肖鹢在他的病房里对记者说：“北京市民对解放军是有感情的，我们和市民的心是相通的，许多误解正在消除。”
    这些官兵５月２３日住进医院后，当天就有群众赶到医院慰问子弟兵。尔后天天都有十几批前来慰问、看望的干部群众。纯朴的老北京人、直爽的青年学生与战士们倾心交谈，加深了理解。北京外贸针织品进出口公司第六团支部的全体团员来到战士们的病床前，表示向解放军学习，做热爱党热爱社会主义祖国热爱人民的好青年。国家计委的一位中年干部代表他的母亲送来了慰问品和一封慰问信。信中说：“在制止这场动乱中，你们被一小撮歹徒和少数不明真象的人打伤，我作为一名八路军老战士、老党员、退休干部、北京市市民，对你们表示亲切地慰问。你们正在用你们的行动向北京市民们证明：人民解放军是最伟大的军队。”
