Title: Why Must We Build Fake Mountains for Beautification?

During my visits to various places, I discovered a peculiar phenomenon: many government agencies, factories, schools, hospitals, and military barracks have fake mountains at their entrances, ostensibly to "beautify the courtyard," but in reality, they are a waste of labor and resources.

In a certain province, the Chemical Industry Bureau has a massive fake mountain in its courtyard, standing at about five or six meters high and covering over a hundred square meters. It is made of "axe-hewn stones" glued together, with a clumsy shape resembling a "patchwork monk's robe." In a certain large enterprise, the originally well-maintained trees and flowers in the factory area were cut down to build a fake mountain, damaging the environment and leading to the removal of the advanced unit title. There are even more innovative examples: in a small courtyard with cement floors and no green trees, several mountain-like structures are piled up next to the factory building, blocking the light from the workshop. Workers complain, saying, "This is money burning!"

Gardening experts believe that in beautifying courtyards, one should primarily use plants for landscaping. If a small amount of natural stones is used as artistic decorations, it will give people a sense of beauty. However, if stones are not used properly, they become nothing more than a pile of rubble.

People's pursuit of beauty increases with economic development and social progress, which is understandable. The problem now is that many units have gone astray in their efforts to beautify courtyards. They are obsessed with piling up mountains and stones, and the trend is becoming more and more bizarre. According to the gardening department, in a city with a population of over a million, more than sixty fake mountains have been built in courtyards in recent years, many of which are poorly shaped and have lost their aesthetic value. If this is the case in a large city, many county and town-level cities are also following this trend...

In mountainous areas with towering peaks, some units go to the trouble of building fake mountains on top of real ones. Some people bluntly say, "The people's basic needs are not yet fully met, but these leaders are not working on real mountains; instead, they are making a fuss over fake ones."

In plain areas where stones are scarce, some units follow the trend, regardless of the cost, and transport stones from hundreds of miles away to build fake mountains. The larger ones use hundreds of cubic meters of stone. According to relevant departments, building a fake mountain costs at least tens of thousands of yuan, and some even cost tens of millions. The expenditure is staggering.

Someone pointed out that in the current situation where funds for various constructions are extremely tight, some units are squandering money like this. Shouldn't they seriously think about it? Why is the fake mountain trend becoming more and more prevalent? In my opinion, the reasons are as follows: some people want to show off and flaunt their wealth; some people have money but don't know how to spend it, resulting in good intentions leading to foolish deeds; some people want to appear cultured and decorate their gates. In short, since they are not spending their own money, they don't mind spending it.

### 美化何必制假山

　　美化何必制假山
    鲁政文
    笔者在各地采访时，发现一个怪现象：不少的机关、工厂、学校、医院、部队营房等单位，迎门见假山，名为“美化庭院”，实则劳民伤财。
    某省的化工厅，当院竖着个高五六米，占地百多平方米的庞然大物——假山。它由“斧劈石”粘接而成，蹩脚的造型，宛如“百衲僧衣”。某个大企业，原来厂区树木花草整齐美观，被评为绿化先进单位。后来砍树造假山，损坏了环境，给摘掉先进单位牌子。更有别出新裁者，院落不大，水泥漫地，不见绿树，却紧靠厂房堆起五六个山头，挡着车间光线。工人不满地说，这是叫钱多烧的！
    园林专家认为，在美化庭院中，应以植物造景为主。如果用少量的自然山石作为艺术小品点缀其间，会给人以美的享受。但是，石头用不好就成了乱石堆。
    人们对美的追求，随着经济的发展，社会的进步，要求越来越高，这无可非议。现在的问题是，不少单位美化庭院走偏了方向。他们醉心于堆山垒石，而且越搞越猎奇。据园林部门介绍，有个上百万人口的城市，近几年乱建庭院假山六十多座，其中不少形状粗劣，失去观赏价值。大城市既然如此，一些地、县城镇也跟着刮起了这股风……
    在峰峦叠嶂的山区，本来抬头就是山，有些单位还多此一举，在真山上摞假山。有人不客气地说，群众温饱问题还没完全解决，这些领导不在真山上下功夫，却在假山上作文章。
    石头奇缺的平原地区，一些单位也赶“时髦”，不惜代价，从百里之外拉石头，营造假山，大的用石竟达数百立方。据有关部门提供的情况，造一座假山少则二三万元，多则十几万、甚至几十万元。耗资之巨，令人咋舌。
    有人指出，在当前各方面建设资金十分紧张的情况下，一些单位竟如此挥霍钱财，难道不应该认真想一想吗！假山风何以越刮越盛？窃以为其原因是：讲排场、摆阔气者有之；有钱不会花，好心办蠢事者有之；附庸风雅、装潢门面者有之。总之，反正不是掏自己的腰包，花钱不心疼。
