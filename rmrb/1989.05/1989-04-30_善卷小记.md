Yixing in Jiangsu Province is renowned as the "World of Caverns," with twenty-four large and small karst caves that have attracted countless scholars and heroes over the past few thousand years. Among these, there is a cave known as the "Cave of Benevolence." It is said that around four to five thousand years ago, during the era of tribal alliances in China, Emperor Yao abdicated the throne to Yu the Great. Yu the Great, in turn, wanted to pass the throne to Shanyuan. Shanyuan, however, did not seek high office and instead chose a life of leisure, leaving the Central Plains and settling in the then-remote mountainous region of Yixing to live in seclusion. This talented poet of the Yu dynasty lived alone in a stone cave, using stones to build a door, and spent his days working from sunrise to sunset, enjoying a carefree old age.

Perhaps this is how the Cave of Benevolence got its name. The authenticity of this story is difficult to verify. What is interesting is that after Shanyuan, during the Tang Dynasty, Li Xian, the Military Governor of Zhao Yi, resided near the Cave of Benevolence at the Bixian Temple to study. One morning, he personally witnessed a white dragon emerging from the water cave of the Cave of Benevolence, breathing in the essence of heaven and earth. This was a significant event. Li Xian immediately wrote a memorial to the emperor, reporting this as an auspicious sign for the emperor, and inscribed a stone with the words "Eternal Miracle."

Li Xian's inscription certainly mythologized the Cave of Benevolence. The Chinese have always revered the dragon as the ultimate symbol of power, but whether it is true or not, no one can say for certain. With Li Xian's testimony, later generations found it difficult to dispute. However, this troubled countless ambitious excavators. In 1933, local dignitary Chu Nanqiang decided to excavate the water cave. He personally supervised the stone workers in their excavation efforts, but the workers, fearing the thousand-year-old dragon, dared not proceed. Coincidentally, at that time, a German circus troupe from Shanghai, the Hakenberg Circus, was performing lion taming and tiger subduing acts. Foreigners were braver than the Chinese, and besides, they had no taboos against dragons. Chu Nanqiang thus placed his hopes on the foreigners. Unfortunately, the foreigners were very shrewd and believed that even if they caught the thousand-year-old dragon, it might not be suitable for performance. Moreover, although they had twenty years of experience in taming animals, capturing a dragon was a first, and if something went wrong, it would not be worth the risk. Therefore, they politely declined.

Chu Nanqiang was determined to find out the truth. He worked day and night, tirelessly, enduring several springs, summers, autumns, and winters, finally excavating the water cave. He then personally took a boat to explore, but of course, he did not see even a trace of the dragon.

At this point, the myth of the white dragon in the water cave could be completely debunked. However, this winding and mysterious water cave, stretching 120 meters long and 4.5 meters wide, with boats sailing through the mountains and oars rowing in the sky, creates an enigmatic atmosphere that remains a mystery in people's hearts. This strange cave world and the words passed down by the sages cannot help but create a mystery. Otherwise, how could so many devout tourists believe in the dragon-like stalactite on the cave walls and compete to collect water? What are they seeking?

If Shanyuan were to see this scene, what would he think? Naturally, it would not be to his liking. Today, it can create countless enchanting illusions, but tomorrow, it might turn everything into nothing. No matter how you write history, the seasons cannot be reconciled.

　　善卷小记
    梅南频
    江苏宜兴是闻名遐迩的“洞天世界”，大大小小二十四个溶洞吸引了上下几千年纵横几万里名人志士驻足。其中有个称作“善卷洞”的，据说四五千年前，我国还处于部落联盟首领禅让时代，唐尧把帝位让给了虞舜，而虞舜却想把帝位让给善卷。善卷其实满可以当仁不让的，却不谋高位，图得清闲，独离中原，到了宜兴山区当时还十分偏僻的地方落脚隐居。这位曾经蛮有才能的虞代诗人，孤居石窟，垒石为门，“日出而作，日暮而辍”，度过了自在的晚年。
    也许，这就成了善卷洞之由来。真假当然无从考证。有意思的是善卷先生之后，唐朝的昭义节度使李?择居善卷洞附近的碧鲜庵读书，某日清晨亲眼目睹有条白龙从善卷洞的水洞里游出，呼吸天地灵气。这非同小可。李?当即即成奏折称报皇帝，此乃天子祥瑞，并勒石题铭“万古灵迹”。
    李?这一题铭当然就神化了善卷洞。中国人从来就是把龙作为至高无上的崇拜物的，真乎假乎谁也无从作答。而这位举足轻重的李?先生有辞作证，后人也就难以作辨了。只是苦了不知多少有志的开掘者。１９３３年，当地名流储南强先生决心打通水洞，他亲自督率石工开凿工程，无奈石工慑于千年潜龙的说法，不敢稍有冒犯。凑巧的是当时上海正有个德国的海京伯马戏团在进行驯狮伏虎表演，外国人的胆子比中国人要大，再说，他们对龙也不犯忌，储先生也就把希望寄托在洋人身上。遗憾的是洋先生十分精明，认为这千年龙捕来未必能演戏，再说驯善虽有二十年经验，可捕龙尚属首次，万一有个三长两短，也化不来，因此，婉言谢绝。
    储先生憋足了这口气，硬是要探个究竟。他夜以继日，不辞劳苦，磨了好几个春夏秋冬，终于打通了水洞。又亲自驾舟探险，结果当然连龙的影子也未见到。
    至此，水洞隐白龙的神话也许完全可以破产。然而这窈窕曲折的水洞，长达一百二十米，宽四米五，船在山中行，桨在天上划的幽奥意境，在人们心中终竟是个谜。这奇异的洞天世界和先贤传下的言辞能不构成奥秘么？不然，那么多虔诚的游客怎会信奉洞壑石壁上那条形似龙脊的乳石，争相接水？图谋什么？
    倘若善卷先生见此情景不知会作何感慨？自然是不尽人意的，今天，它可以造化出众多迷人的幻境，明天，也许会将一切化为乌有。任凭你怎么去编写历史，季节不可调和。
