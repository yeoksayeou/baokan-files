Toward efficiency through management and increasing production through economy, Huainan selects and supports key industries.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hefei on May 19, facing the situation of tight funds, materials, and energy, how should industrial and commercial production be organized? The experience of Anhui Province's Huainan City is: select and support key industries, seek efficiency through management, and increase production through economy.

Huainan City's objective conditions are not good, and the state has not given them any special treatment. As an energy city, coal is still short by more than 400,000 tons, and electricity is short by more than 300 million kilowatt-hours. Facing these difficulties, Huainan City, based on the state's industrial policies and market demand, combined with local realities, adopts the methods of enterprise ranking, management ranking, product queuing, transformation ranking, indicator ranking, and benefit ranking. It conducts a reasonable comparison and comprehensive evaluation of the operating results of major local industrial enterprises in the city for 10 economic and technological indicators, ranks the enterprises according to their scores and management levels, and publishes the rankings every quarter to promote enterprises to strive for progress and excellence. For key projects included in the national and provincial transformation plans, the sequence is determined, and resources are guaranteed from the aspects of funds and manpower. In addition, by calculating the internal potential account, the economic benefit targets that enterprises can achieve are fully listed, and it is required to make every effort to complete them. After implementing classified queuing and selective support, the limited funds flow rationally, and the organization and supply of tense energy and materials tend to be reasonable, thus achieving the goal of "using good steel on the blade" and helping enterprises overcome the current difficulties.

　　向管理要效益　以节约求增产
    淮南择优扶持保重点工业
    据新华社合肥５月１９日电  （记者陈宝善）面对资金、原材料、能源紧缺的形势，怎样组织工交生产？安徽省淮南市提供的经验是：择优扶持保重点，向管理要效益，以节约求增产。
    淮南市的客观条件并不好，国家也未给他们吃“小灶”。身为能源城，煤炭却缺口４０万多吨，电力缺口３亿多度。面对这些困难，淮南市根据国家产业政策和市场需求情况，结合本地实际，采取企业排序，管理排厂，产品排队，改造排项，指标排实，效益排满的办法，对全市主要地方工业企业的经营成果，进行合理的对比综合评估，对１０项经济技术指标考核打分，按得分多少、企业管理水平高低排出企业名次，每季度公布一次，推动企业争先进、争上游；对列入国家和省技改计划的重点项目，排出顺序，从资金、物力上保证重点；另外，通过算内部挖潜帐，把企业能实现的经济效益目标排满，要求尽力完成。实行分类排队择优扶持后，使有限的资金流向，紧张的能源、原材料的组织供应趋于合理，从而做到“好钢用在刀刃上”，使企业渡过目前面临的困难。
