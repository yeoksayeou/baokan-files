Five years ago, Qinghe County was one of the poorest counties in Hebei Province. Today, thanks to a group of wealthy entrepreneurs, nearly 20,000 private enterprises have emerged, transforming it into one of the wealthiest counties in the province.

In the midst of the reform wave, a new administrative unit appeared in the organizational structure of Qinghe County, Hebei Province: the Support Office for Leading Entrepreneurs. This unique office, the only one of its kind among China's more than 2,000 counties, has attracted considerable attention.

The Support Office for Leading Entrepreneurs in Qinghe County was established as the rural reform deepened and the county's household industries flourished. Household industries in Qinghe began in 1984. Within two years, nearly a hundred daring and enterprising young people emerged from the ranks of workers and merchants, becoming millionaires with assets of several hundred thousand or even millions of yuan. In their business activities, they often encountered difficulties they couldn't solve on their own. At the same time, their success drew criticism; some said they had too many employees, others accused them of exploiting workers to get rich. These difficulties and criticisms made the entrepreneurs hesitant, not only hindering their own development but also affecting the thousands of farmers who followed their lead in starting businesses. In this situation, the Qinghe County Party Committee and the county government realized that these entrepreneurs played a leading role in the development of household industries and needed protection and support. After several discussions, they decisively established the Support Office for Leading Entrepreneurs, with the county's Party Committee, People's Congress, and government leaders serving as directors and deputy directors, and heads of relevant departments such as the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau, Tax Bureau, and Public Security Bureau as members. The office used administrative, economic, and legal means to support, assist, protect, and serve the entrepreneurs, promptly helping them solve problems.

Young farmer Xue Junsheng needed certification for his metal hoses. The Support Office for Leading Entrepreneurs handled it for him, enabling him to pass the provincial-level certification. Entrepreneur Zhuang Rongchang wanted to form a joint venture with Xinjiang, and the Support Office provided a guarantee. Wool specialist Xu Changxiu was stopped by a commercial bureau on his way to deliver goods, and they demanded 6,000 yuan in fines before he could proceed. After receiving Xu's urgent call, the Support Office rushed to the scene, arguing according to relevant regulations and policies, and protected Xu's rights, ensuring that his goods worth over 200,000 yuan were delivered on time...

The actions of the Support Office for Leading Entrepreneurs had a strong impact on the broad masses of farmers engaged in business. The entrepreneurs gained confidence. In the past two years, more than 600 households with annual outputs exceeding 400,000 yuan emerged! The development of these entrepreneurs drove the county's household industries. In Qinghe, farmers have a saying: "Each village looks to its own, each household to its own, and those engaged in business look to the entrepreneurs." Farmers view the entrepreneurs as "weather stations" and "barometers" in developing household industries. In Daming Township's Dama Village, Zhang Lidian, a leading entrepreneur in rubber parts processing, was supported by the Support Office for Leading Entrepreneurs and became even more enthusiastic. Soon, Dama Village had one leading household driving the entire village. Within a year, 158 out of 161 households in the village started rubber parts processing, and all became "ten-thousand-yuan households." Now, the county has 9 specialized townships and 142 specialized villages, with 60% of the households engaged in business and becoming wealthy.

Last year, Qinghe County's per capita income reached 641 yuan, making it one of the wealthiest counties in the province.

　　清河有个支持大户办公室
    许金亭
    五年前，清河县还是河北省最贫困的县份之一；如今，这里靠着一批致富大户，带起了近两万个民营企业，一举变成了全省有名的富裕县。
    　　　　　　　
    在改革大潮中，河北省清河县的行政编制系列里，新冒出了一个机构——支持大户办公室。
    这个全国两千多个县绝无仅有的机构，引起了众多人的瞩目。
    清河县的支持大户办公室，是伴随着农村改革的深入和全县家庭工业的蓬勃兴起诞生的。这里的家庭工业起步于１９８４年，两年时间，就有近百名敢闯敢干的青年人，从务工经商的人群中脱颖而出，成了几十万元甚至上百万元的富裕大户。他们在经营活动中，时常遇到一些自己解决不了的困难，同时，他们的冒尖儿，也引起了阵阵非议，有人说他们雇工“超员”，有人指责他们剥削致富，等等。困难加非议，使得大户在致富路上疑虑重重，不仅自身难以继续发展，而且也影响了紧随其后的千家万户务工经商的农民。在这种情况下，清河县委、县政府的领导清醒地意识到，经营大户对全县家庭工业的发展起着带头示范作用，应采取相应的措施对他们进行保护和支持。于是，几经研究，果断地成立了由县委、人大、政府负责人任正副组长，工商局、税务局、公安局等有关部门负责同志为成员的支持大户办公室，运用行政、经济和法律手段，对大户实行“支持、帮助、保护、服务”，及时为他们排忧解难。
    青年农民薛俊生，生产的金属软管需要搞鉴定，支持大户办公室一手为其操办，使其顺利地通过了省级鉴定，农民企业家庄荣昌同新疆搞联营，支持大户办公室为他担保。绒毛专业大户许长修押车送货，途中被一家工商所非法扣留，说是交出６０００元罚款才得放行。支持大户办公室收到许长修的告急电后，昼夜兼程前往，按照有关法规政策，据理力争，使许长修的权益得到保护，价值２００多万元的货及时送到了需方……
    支持大户办公室的行动，在广大务工经商农民中引起了强烈反响，大户们的胆子放开了。两年多来，全县出现了６００多家年产值４０万元以上的大户！大户的发展又带动了全县家庭工业。在清河农民中流传着这样一句口头禅：“村看村，户看户，务工经商看大户。”农民们在发展家庭工业中，把大户们看成“气象台”、“晴雨表”。坝营乡大马屯村橡胶件加工大户张立冬，被列为支持大户办公室的支持对象后，干得更起劲了。很快大马屯村就出现了一家带全村的局面。一年间，全村１６１户中的１５８户搞起了橡胶件加工业，而且个个都成了“万元户”。现在，全县涌现出了９个专业乡，１４２个专业村，有６０％的农户走上了务工经商致富路。
    去年清河县人均收入达到了６４１元，成了全省名列前茅的富裕县。
