The sixth Pan-Pacific Judo Championships are about to commence. The reporter visited the Yuentan Sports Stadium to observe the teams' training sessions. On the stands, I encountered He Guoxiang, the Secretary-General of the Chinese Judo Association, and asked him about the preparations for the championship and the status of the Chinese team.

He Guoxiang first handed me a program book and pointed to the photos inside, saying, "So many international judo officials have come; it's truly a grand event. The president of the International Judo Federation, S. Carolian, has come, as has the president of the Pan-Pacific Judo Organization, Abe Ichiro. The president of the Asian Judo Union, Katsura Yukimitsu, is also here, along with the president of the Oceania Judo Union. The president of the International Judo Federation described this championship as a gathering of top judo athletes from Asia, the Americas, and Oceania, and expressed hope that this event will contribute to the development of judo."

When asked about the preparations for the championship, He Guoxiang said, "The international judo officials and the teams are quite satisfied with the beautiful Yuentan Sports Stadium, believing that the sports equipment is excellent. The only shortcomings mentioned are that the scoreboard is too simple and that the two competition areas are too close, which can cause interference. I think these comments are very constructive and will have a positive impact on our hosting of the judo events at the Asian Games next year." He said, "One of the purposes of this competition is to test the venue, equipment, and organizational work through the championship, so as to gain experience and successfully host the judo events at the Asian Games."

He Guoxiang said, "The referees will also face a strict test. Many international referees have been invited for this competition, and our country has also sent many referees. This is both an examination and an opportunity for mutual learning and improvement."

He Guoxiang believes that this championship not only has a large number of participating teams but also has received support from domestic and overseas business circles. Companies such as the Hong Kong United Science and Technology Research Center, Jet Company, and Shandong Taishan Sports Equipment Factory have all supported the judo competition, which is a rare phenomenon in the past. Previously, it was very difficult to organize judo competitions and it was hard to gain social support. This shows that judo is gaining momentum.

Finally, He Guoxiang briefly introduced the status of our country's participating men's and women's teams. The women's team is stronger than the men's team, and their techniques are also better. The women's team is characterized by daring to fight, having strong self-confidence, and being powerful in higher weight classes and agile in lower weight classes. In several international competitions, the female judo athletes have won gold medals, with Gao Fenglian being particularly outstanding and becoming a star, being named one of the top ten athletes in the country. In comparison, the men's team is somewhat weaker, mainly lacking in self-confidence and strength. Through this competition, it will be beneficial for our country's male and female athletes to broaden their horizons, improve their skills, and foster friendship.

　　柔道运动出现好势头    
    ——我柔协秘书长何国香谈泛太平洋柔道赛
    本报记者  黄振中
    第六届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛即将开幕，记者来到月坛体育馆赛场看各队训练。在看台上遇到了中国柔道协会秘书长何国香，请她谈了大赛的准备情况和中国队的状况。
    何国香先是递过一本秩序册给我看，并指着册内的照片说：来了这么多国际柔道官员，真是一次盛会。国际柔道联合会主席萨·卡洛里安来了，泛太平洋柔道组织主席安部一郎来了，亚洲柔联主席嘉纳行光也来了，还有大洋洲柔联主席。国际柔联主席称这次大赛是亚洲、美洲、大洋洲三大洲柔道高手的盛会，并希望本届比赛为柔道运动的发展做出贡献。
    在回答大赛的准备情况时，何国香说：国际柔道组织的官员和各队对漂亮的月坛体育馆比较满意，认为各种体育器材都不错，感到不足的地方有两处，一是记分牌比较简单；二是两块场地离得过近，容易出现干扰。何国香感到，这些意见都很中肯，对我国明年举办亚运会柔道赛会产生积极的作用。她说，这次比赛的目的之一就是通过大赛考验一下赛场、器材和竞赛组织工作，以便取得经验，把亚运会柔道赛搞好。
    何国香说，裁判也将接受一次严格的考验。这次比赛请来了许多国际裁判，我国自己也派出了不少裁判，这既是一次考试，又是一次互相学习和提高的机会。
    何国香认为，本届大赛不仅参赛的队多，而且得到海内外企业界的支持，香港统一科技研究中心有限公司、捷特公司和山东泰山体育器材厂等都支持柔道比赛，这是过去少见的现象。以前办柔道赛难极了，不容易得到社会的支持，可见柔道运动出现了好势头。
    最后，何国香简单介绍了我国参赛的男女队状况。女队实力高于男队，技术也好。女队的特点是敢拚敢斗，自信心强；大级别力量强，小级别灵活多变。在几次国际大赛中，柔道巾帼都夺得金牌，尤其是高凤莲更为出色，已成为明星，被评为全国十佳运动员。男队相比之下就差一些，主要是自信心不足，力量较差。通过这次比赛，对我国男女选手将会起到开阔眼界，提高技艺，增进友谊的作用。
