In Wuhan, you can return beer bottles after drinking, but in Beijing, it's different. Usually, places selling beer do not accept returned bottles. Therefore, the same beer in Beijing is about 0.20 yuan more expensive than in Wuhan.

It is said that Beijing used to have a bottle return policy, but this changed a couple of years ago. This change shows the "cleverness" of Beijing's beer sellers. Generally, those who drink beer in restaurants do not take the bottles with them. The restaurant thus gets the bottles for free, without having to pay any deposit.

The author offers an equation: Not returning bottles = indirect price increase = picking the customers' pockets.

An agrarian who came to the city went to an individual vendor's stall to buy a watermelon. He asked, "How much per pound?" The vendor replied, "Very cheap, 0.40 yuan, eat first and pay later." After eating the watermelon, when it was time to pay, the seller insisted it was 4 yuan per pound. The agrarian argued, but the seller was unreasonable and even banged the cutting knife on the stall counter. The agrarian felt unlucky and had to pay 4 yuan per pound.

It seems that in the future, when buying things from small stalls, one must be careful not to fall for this kind of "thug pricing."

Who would have thought that losing a button could cause such trouble. To buy a needle, I ran to several stores, but still returned empty-handed. Upon inquiry, the reason for the difficulty in buying needles was quite simple: considering the low profit, new stores and markets do not want to set up a needle and thread counter; because of the low profit margin, stores and markets that used to sell needles no longer do so.

    （一）
    在武汉，喝完啤酒可以退瓶，但北京却不同，卖酒处一般都不接受退瓶。因此，同样的啤酒北京比武汉要贵二角左右。
    据说北京以前也有退瓶的规矩，是近两年才改的。这一改，倒显出了北京卖酒人的“聪明”。因为大凡进饭店喝啤酒的，没几位会把酒瓶揣走。店家由此落了个便宜，既可以得到顾客“退回”的瓶子，又不必付分文退瓶费。
    笔者送他们一道等式：不退酒瓶＝变相涨价＝掏顾客的腰包。

    一个进城的农民到个体户摊前准备买西瓜，问：“多少钱一斤？”答：“非常便宜，四毛，先吃后付钱。”　吃完瓜付钱时，卖者硬说是四元一斤。农民据理力争，对方蛮不讲理，还频频用锋利的切瓜刀敲着摊板。农民自认倒霉，只好按每斤四元付钱。
    看样子，今后到小摊前买东西，得当心别上了这类“流氓价格”的当。

    万万没想到，一粒钮扣掉了也成了不小的麻烦。为了买根针，我一连跑了好几家商店，结果还是失望而归。一打听，买针难的原因十分简单：考虑到赚钱少，新开业的商场、商店不愿设针线柜；因为利率低，曾经经营针的商店、商场也不再销售。
