Some Latin American countries and leaders criticized the Panamanian government's decision to declare the elections "invalid" on May 11.

It is reported that 13 Latin American governments have requested that the Organization of American States (OAS) convene a meeting of foreign ministers on May 15 to analyze the current political situation in Panama. The OAS Permanent Council has agreed to hold a special meeting on May 12.

Venezuelan President Perez emphasized in Caracas on May 11 that declaring Panama's elections "invalid" is tantamount to a "coup d'état."

The Peruvian government stated in a declaration that canceling the election results is a violation of the will of the Panamanian people.

Honduran President Ascona, who was visiting Spain, believed that the Panamanian government should respect the opposition and hand over power to the winner of the elections.

Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Cordovez and Costa Rican Foreign Minister Madrid, who was visiting Ecuador, both expressed in Quito on May 11 that the only way to resolve the political crisis in Panama is to respect the will of the majority of Panamanians. Otherwise, it will pose another threat to peace in Central America.

Cuban Foreign Minister Malmierca, who was visiting Spain, pointed out on May 11 that the Panamanian government's declaration of the election as invalid is the result of "genuine U.S. intervention."

The European Community countries condemned the Panamanian government's decision to declare the May 7 elections invalid on May 11.

A European Community press release distributed by the Spanish Foreign Ministry on May 11 stated that the Panamanian government's declaration of the elections as invalid on May 10 is a trampling of the will of the people. The EC countries condemned the series of abnormal phenomena that occurred during the Panamanian elections and the actions of the military government that endangered the personal safety of opposition leaders.

The statement expressed that the EC countries will not stand idly by regarding the serious situation in Panama.

On May 11, U.S. President Bush (top photo) announced at the White House to the press that he would send 2,000 combat troops to Panama to protect the lives of U.S. personnel in Panama. The bottom photo shows part of the combat troops from the 7th Infantry Division stationed in California, which the U.S. plans to send to Panama.
