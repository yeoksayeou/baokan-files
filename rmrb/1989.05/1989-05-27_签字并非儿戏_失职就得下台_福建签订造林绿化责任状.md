Signing is no joke; negligence means stepping down
Fujian signs afforestation and greening responsibility statements

Our reporter Zhang Mingqing reports from Fuzhou: When signing the "Afforestation and Greening Responsibility Statement," the leaders of various cities and counties in Fujian Province understand the weight of those words: the burden of greening the province over seven years will be shared by them. If they fail to keep their promises, they will receive a "yellow card" warning at the least, and at worst, they will have to hand in their "official hats."

As one of China's key southern forest regions, forestry is a major advantage for Fujian. However, in recent years, forests have been in a state of continuous "deficit," and the destruction of forest resources has made this advantage difficult to sustain. To change this situation, on May 22, at the conclusion of the provincial forestry work conference in Sanming, a pilot area for collective forest reform in southern China, Fujian proposed a plan to eliminate 26 million mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation across the province by 1995, and to break down this task into responsibilities for each county through responsibility statements.

The responsibility statements clearly stipulate that the aforementioned tasks are not affected by changes in party and government leadership or leadership changes. The province will conduct an annual inspection and summary of the implementation of the responsibility statements. Those who complete the tasks well will be commended and rewarded. Those who fail to complete the tasks will be criticized and reported, and unqualified leaders will be removed from their posts. For those who pass the inspection and complete the afforestation tasks on time and meet the standards, a bonus of 100,000 yuan will be issued. For those who complete the tasks ahead of schedule, a bonus of 200,000 yuan will be issued.

### 签字并非儿戏　失职就得下台  福建签订造林绿化责任状

　　签字并非儿戏　失职就得下台
    福建签订造林绿化责任状
    本报福州５月２７日电  记者张铭清报道：在“造林绿化责任状”上签字时，福建省各地市县的领导人明白那几个字的分量：全省７年绿化的重担将由他们分担起来，要是言而无信，轻则“黄牌”警告，重则交出“乌纱帽”。
    作为我国南方重点林区，林业是福建一大优势。但是，近几年，森林连年“赤字”，森业资源破坏已使这一优势难以为继。为了改变这种状况，５月２２日，在我国南方集体林区改革试验区三明市结束的省林业工作会议上，福建提出到１９９５年消灭全省宜林荒山２６００万亩的计划，以责任状的形式，层层分解到各县。
    责任状上明确规定，上述任务不受党政换届和领导人变动的影响。全省每年对责任状执行的情况进行一次检查总结。对完成任务好的，给予表彰和奖励。完成任务不好的，要通报批评，不称职的领导将被免职。对经过验收达到标准、如期完成造林任务的，发给奖金１万元，提前完成任务的发给奖金两万元。
