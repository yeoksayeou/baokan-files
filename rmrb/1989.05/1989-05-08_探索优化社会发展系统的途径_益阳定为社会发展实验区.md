China's social scientists have embarked on a highly complex systems engineering project.

After repeated discussions, experts from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the National Bureau of Statistics have designated Yiyang City in Hunan Province as the first social development experimental zone in the country. The goal is to explore ways to optimize the social development system.

It is understood that over the next ten years, this experimental zone will start by strengthening community-level construction at the grassroots level. It will effectively address social issues, gradually streamline internal government mechanisms, and establish relationships between the government, enterprises, and grassroots communities. The aim is to build systems for social management, social security, education, the environment, and social monitoring.

Yiyang City is a medium-sized city on the banks of Dongting Lake, integrating urban and rural areas. Social scientists believe that Yiyang City is representative of the urbanization process in medium-sized cities. Currently, experts have categorized social issues into economic order, social order, urban construction, social security, lifestyle, and psychological orientation, and have begun the first phase of project trials.

　　探索优化社会发展系统的途径    
    益阳定为社会发展实验区
    本报长沙５月８日电  记者杜若原报道：中国的社会学者已开始建设一项极其复杂的系统工程。
    来自中国社科院、民政部和国家统计局的专家经过反复论证，确定湖南省益阳市为国内第一个社会发展实验区，探索优化社会发展系统的途径。
    据了解，在十年的时间内，这个试验区将从加强基层社区建设入手，有效地治理社会问题，逐步理顺政府内部机制、政府与企业及基层社区的关系，建立社会管理、社会保障、教育、环境和社会检测系统。
    益阳市是洞庭湖畔的中小城市，城乡一体。社会学者们认为，益阳市在中小城市的城市化进程中具有代表性。目前，专家们已将社会问题列出经济秩序、社会秩序、城市建设、社会保障、生活方式、心理导向等类，并着手进行第一阶段的项目试验。
