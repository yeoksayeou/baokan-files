Party Members Paying Dues on Time

On March 19 last year, your newspaper published an article titled "Party Fee Controversy" on the fifth page, revealing that the former deputy director of the Public Security Bureau of Yuncheng, Shanxi, Cui Liuxi, had not paid his party dues for two years and nine months. Now, with the approval of the Yuncheng Municipal Party Committee Organization Department, Cui Liuxi has been expelled from the party. This has caused a strong reaction in Yuncheng.

The Yuncheng Public Security Bureau has 19 party branches and over 190 party members. In the past, due to the lack of organizational life, some party members did not pay their dues for a long time and did not participate in organizational activities; some party members violated laws and discipline. After the publication of "Party Fee Controversy," the Yuncheng Public Security Bureau organized all cadres to examine the Party Constitution, find the root causes, identify gaps, and take measures. They established a party fee registration system. Retired cadre Yang Zhiqiang, who is hospitalized due to illness, repeatedly instructed the bureau leaders when they visited him in the hospital: "After receiving the salary, do not forget to pay the party dues on his behalf." Old party member Li Wencao rides his bicycle from 15 kilometers away to the bureau every time it is time to pay party dues. The Anyi Police Station Party Branch consists of four police stations: Taocun, Sanjiazhuang, Dongjiao, and Anyi, with a total of 10 party members. These police stations have long lines and wide distribution, but each party member pays their dues on time every month. Comrade Liu Hongzheng of the Political Work Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau said: "In the past, collecting party dues required daily phone calls and letters to remind, but they were still not collected on time. Now, without waiting for you to collect, each party branch has already submitted them on time." Comrade Wang Xicheng, the political instructor of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, said: "The newspaper's criticism has greatly promoted our work. If it were not for this, our bureau would not know what state it would be in now."

The newspaper's criticism has promoted the work of this bureau. According to incomplete statistics, in December last year alone, the entire bureau solved 163 cases of various types, cracked down on 29 criminal gangs, and arrested 398 criminals of various types.

专栏：批评以后

　　党员按期交党费
    去年３月１９日，你报第五版刊登了题为《党费风波》的信访调查，披露了山西运城市公安局原副局长崔留喜２年零９个月不交纳党费的问题。现经运城市委组织部批准，给予崔留喜党内除名。这在运城市引起了强烈的反应。
    运城市公安局有１９个党支部、１９０多名党员，过去由于组织生活不健全，有些党员长期不交党费，不参加组织生活；个别党员违法乱纪。《党费风波》见报后，运城市公安局组织全体干警对照党章挖根源、找差距、定措施，建立了党费登记制度。离休老干部杨志强因病住院，局领导人去医院看望他时，老杨反复嘱咐：发了工资不要忘记代他交党费。老党员李文孝每到交党费的日子，便从１５公里外骑车赶到局里。安邑派出所党支部由陶村、三家庄、东郊、安邑４个派出所组成，共１０名党员。这几个派出所战线长，分布广，然而每个党员每月按期交纳党费。市公安局政工办公室刘宏璋同志说：“过去收党费，每天打电话要，写信催，都收不齐。现在不等你收，一到时候，各个党支部早都交来了。”市公安局教导员王喜成同志说：“报纸的批评对我们的工作促进太大了，若不是这样，现在我局还不知道成个啥样子。”
    报纸批评促进了这个局的工作。据不完全统计，仅去年１２月，全局共破获各种案件１６３起，打击犯罪团伙２９个，抓获各种犯罪分子３９８人。
