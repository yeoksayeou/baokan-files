From May 4th to 6th, the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was held in Beijing. Over 3,000 representatives from 47 member countries and regions, including governors, senior officials, financiers, and major international commercial financial institutions, attended the conference. This was a grand international financial gathering held in Beijing.

During the meeting, the ADB governors reviewed the bank's work report for the previous year, assessed the economic situation in their respective countries (regions) as well as in the Asia-Pacific region and the world, and extensively exchanged views on issues such as poverty alleviation, accelerating economic development, and further enhancing the role of the ADB. The meeting was a resounding success and will play a positive role in promoting economic development and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

The Asian Development Bank is the most important international financial institution in the Asia-Pacific region. Its mission is to provide loans and technical assistance to developing member countries and regions in the region, thereby promoting economic development and cooperation in the region. Since its establishment in 1966, the ADB has provided loans to 29 developing member countries, funding a total of 840 projects with a total value of $25 billion. Over the past 20 years, the economies of the ADB's developing members have developed rapidly, with an average annual economic growth rate of 6%, which is inseparable from the support and assistance of the ADB. Many developing members praised the ADB's contributions to "promoting economic development in the region" at the annual meeting.

The economic development of the Asia-Pacific region is remarkable, but there is still a significant gap in economic levels between developed countries and developing countries. Nearly 600 million people in the region still live in extreme poverty. The governor from Pakistan pointed out in his speech that poverty has become the "main obstacle" to development in some countries. Therefore, helping these countries to overcome poverty has become a common call from the ADB's developing members. The governor from India called on the ADB to increase project funding more directly, especially in the areas of healthcare, primary education, and rural development. Governors from countries like Bhutan and Vanuatu called for the ADB to adjust its loan policies to make assistance to small countries more flexible. The ADB governors emphasized that eliminating poverty in the Asia-Pacific region should be the ADB's main task in the future. The consensus reached by developed and developing member countries (regions) on the issue of poverty alleviation at the annual meeting is of positive significance.

The Asia-Pacific countries vary widely in their stages of economic development, scale, resource allocation, achievements, and challenges they face. This diversity objectively provides favorable conditions for dialogue and cooperation among countries in the region through various channels and forms. To meet the growing demand for capital and promote the economic development of the entire Asia-Pacific region, the ADB actively encourages dialogue and cooperation among member countries. President Fujioka hopes to elevate the cooperation among ADB members to a new level. This call was met with enthusiastic responses from the attending governors.

At this annual meeting, a research report on the role of the ADB in the 1990s, prepared by an international group of renowned experts, sparked heated discussions among the representatives. One notable point in this research report is that economic growth is no longer the sole goal of development; only growth accompanied by improvements in social conditions and protection of the natural environment should be encouraged. To this end, the research report suggests that the ADB should shift its loans in the 1990s from the previous focus on agriculture, transportation, energy, and communications to primarily supporting health, education, poverty alleviation, and ecological protection. This view was endorsed by the majority of the developing member countries.

The governor from Taipei, China, Guo Wanrong, led a delegation to Beijing to participate in the 22nd Annual Meeting of the ADB Board of Governors and was welcomed by the government of the People's Republic of China and other ADB member countries. The chairman of this annual meeting, Li Guixian, the governor from the People's Republic of China, and the president of the ADB, Fujioka, were both pleased with the contact between the ADB members on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. Governor Guo expressed at the end of the conference, "This annual meeting was very successful, and the cooperation was excellent."

The world is progressing, the Asia-Pacific region is rising, and the ADB is growing. People look forward to the ADB making greater contributions to the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region in the future. The Asia-Pacific region will welcome a new century with a new face!

　　促合作发展　作更大贡献   
    ——亚行第２２届年会述评
    本报记者  吴迎春  蒋千红
    ５月４日至６日，亚洲开发银行理事会第２２届年会在北京举行。来自４７个成员国家和地区的理事、高级官员、金融家以及主要国际商业金融机构的代表３０００余人出席会议。这是在北京举行的一次规模盛大的国际金融会议。
    会议期间，亚行理事们审议了亚行去年的工作报告，回顾了本国（地区）以及亚太地区和整个世界的经济形势，并就消除贫困、加速经济发展和进一步发挥亚行作用等问题广泛地交换了意见。这是一次圆满的会议，将对促进亚太地区的经济发展和合作起积极的作用。
    亚洲开发银行是亚太地区最重要的国际金融机构。其宗旨是向本地区发展中成员国家和地区提供贷款和技术援助，促进本地区的经济发展与合作。亚行自１９６６年成立以来，在其２０多年间，向２９个发展中成员提供了贷款，建设项目总数达８４０多个，总金额为２５０亿美元。近２０年，亚行发展中成员经济发展迅速。其实际经济增长率年均６％，这与亚行的支持和帮助是分不开的。许多发展中成员在年会上赞扬了亚行在“促进本地区的经济发展”方面作出的贡献。
    亚太地区的经济发展令人瞩目，但发达国家和发展中国家的经济水平仍然有着巨大的差距。本地区至今仍有近６亿人生活在赤贫之中。巴基斯坦理事在发言中指出，贫困已成为一些国家发展的“主要障碍”。因而，帮助它们摆脱贫困已成为亚行发展中成员的普遍呼声。印度理事在发言中要求亚行更直接地增加项目资金，特别是在医疗保健、初等教育和农村发展等方面。不丹、瓦努阿图等国理事要求亚行调整它的贷款政策，使之对小国的援助更为灵活。亚行理事们强调把摆脱亚太地区贫困作为亚行今后的主要任务。年会上，发达成员国和发展中成员国（地区）就消除贫困问题达成共识有着积极的意义。
    亚太国家在经济发展阶段、规模、资源配置及所取得的成就和面临的挑战方面呈广泛的多样性，这在客观上为这一地区国家间多种渠道和多种形式的对话与合作提供了有利条件。为满足日益扩大的资本需求和促进整个亚太地区的经济发展，亚行积极鼓励成员国之间的对话与合作。藤冈行长希望将亚行成员之间的合作提高到一个新的水平。这一呼吁得到了与会理事们的积极响应。
    在本届年会上，由国际知名专家小组就亚行在９０年代作用所作的研究报告在代表中引起了热烈的讨论。这个研究报告的一个引人注目之处是，认为经济增长已不再是发展所追求的唯一目标，只有伴随着社会条件的改善和自然环境的保护的增长才是应当加以鼓励的。为此，该研究报告建议亚行将９０年代的贷款从过去的农业、交通、能源及通讯转向主要用于保健、教育、消除贫困及保护生态环境等领域。这一观点得到大多数发展中国家成员的赞成。
    中国台北理事郭婉容率团来北京参加亚行理事会第２２届年会，受到了中华人民共和国政府和其他亚行成员国的欢迎。本届年会主席、中华人民共和国理事李贵鲜和亚行行长藤冈对于海峡两岸的亚行成员的接触均感到很高兴。郭理事在大会结束时表示，“这次年会开得很顺利，合作得非常好。”
    世界在进步，亚太在崛起，亚行在成长。人们期待着亚行在今后为亚太地区经济的发展作出更大的贡献。亚太将以崭新的面貌迎接一个新世纪的到来！
