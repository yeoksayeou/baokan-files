The procuratorial organs of Shanxi Province have investigated and solved a series of major embezzlement and bribery cases by the end of May 19th, causing a significant impact on society.

Since the fourth quarter of 1988, various levels of procuratorial departments in Shanxi Province have prioritized the fight against embezzlement and bribery as the primary task in combating economic crimes. Based on public reports and exposures, the procuratorial departments have initiated investigations, made arrests, and filed lawsuits in a timely manner, achieving notable results. Wei Qinghai, the cashier and warehouse manager of the Mengxian Branch of the Agricultural Bank of China in Meng County, embezzled over 800,000 yuan by abusing his authority. Jiao Yonggui, a cadre of the Timber Company in Linfen Region, embezzled over 137,000 yuan by abusing his authority. These two major cases were promptly investigated and prosecuted, and the court handed down sentences according to the law. Both Wei Qinghai and Jiao Yonggui were sentenced to life imprisonment.

From January to April this year, the procuratorial departments across the province handled a total of 427 economic crime cases, including 109 major cases, a 73% increase compared to the same period last year. They have lawfully arrested 93 individuals. Through these cases, economic losses amounting to 9.92 million yuan were recovered.
