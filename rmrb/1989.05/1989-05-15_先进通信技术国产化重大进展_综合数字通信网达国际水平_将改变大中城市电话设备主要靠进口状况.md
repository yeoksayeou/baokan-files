Significant Advances in Domestic Production of Advanced Communication Technology
Integrated Digital Communication Network Reaches International Standards
Will Change the Situation Where Major and Medium-Sized Cities Rely Heavily on Imported Telephone Equipment

Significant progress has been made in China's communication science and technology, enabling the construction of an integrated digital communication network (IDN) that meets international standards using domestically developed technology and equipment. Today, experts attending the "Program-Controlled Digital Switching System—Optical Fiber Communication System Joint Trial Project Appraisal Meeting" in Beijing said that the success of this key national scientific and technological project marks a significant step forward in the domestic production of advanced communication equipment.

Program-controlled digital switching systems and optical fiber communication systems are two cutting-edge technologies that countries around the world are racing to develop. The DS-2000 program-controlled digital switching machine and the multi-mode long-wavelength fiber optic three-group communication system, which were approved today, are the first domestically developed equipment in China. These domestically produced devices can form an integrated communication network that realizes various digital transmission services between switching machines. After more than four years of research, operation, and practical network testing, the performance of the equipment has been stable, and the communication quality has met national standards and the recommendations of the International Telecommunication Union. It can be promoted for use in the construction of domestic communication networks, which will change the situation where the development of telephone communications in major and medium-sized cities in China mainly relies on imported equipment.

This project is led by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Scientific Academy, adopting a new contract management method, with 24 units participating in the research and development. It is reported that the research department is currently conducting trials for digital network synchronization and common channel signaling on the network. During the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, further development of the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) will be carried out based on this foundation, further realizing various digital transmission functions between switching machines and users.

　　先进通信技术国产化重大进展    
    综合数字通信网达国际水平    
    将改变大中城市电话设备主要靠进口状况
    新华社北京５月１５日电（实习生姜歆远 记者李玫）我国通信科学技术取得重大进展，已经能够用国内自行研制的技术和装备建设达到世界水平的综合数字通信网（ＩＤＮ）。今天，在北京参加“程控数字交换机—光缆通信系统联合试验工程鉴定会”的专家们说，这项国家科技重点攻关项目的成功，标志着我国先进通信设备的国产化迈出可喜步伐。
    程控数字交换机和光缆通信系统是当代通信技术领域中各国争相开发的两大新兴技术。今天通过鉴定的这项工程采取的ＤＳ—２０００程控数字交换机和多模长波长光纤三次群光通信系统是我国首次研制成功的设备，用这些国产设备组成可以实现交换机之间的各种数字传输业务的综合通信网。经过４年多的研制、运行和实际进网的考验，设备各项性能稳定，通信质量达到了国家标准和国际电联的建议要求，可以在国内通信网的建设中推广使用，这将可改变我国发展大中城市电话通信主要依靠进口设备的状况。
    这项工程由邮电部科学院负责，采取新的合同管理方式，２４个单位参加研制。据透露，目前科研部门正在进行使综合数字网（ＩＤＮ）更加完善的网上数字网同步和公共信道信令试验。“八五”期间，还将在此基础上开发综合业务数字网（ＩＳＤＮ），进一步实现交换机和用户之间的各种数字传输功能。
