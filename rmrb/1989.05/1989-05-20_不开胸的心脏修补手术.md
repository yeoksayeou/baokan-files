    Non-Sternotomy Heart Repair Surgery
    Xinhua News Agency, London, May 17th — (Reporter: Wang Guorui) The United Kingdom has successfully performed a heart repair surgery on an adult without opening the chest.

    Doctors at London's Brook Hospital performed this surgery yesterday on a 66-year-old woman. She had a heart attack in September last year, resulting in a perforation between the left and right ventricles of her heart.

    Using X-ray imaging, the doctors inserted a thin catheter through a small incision in the groin, guiding it into the veins until it reached the heart perforation.

    A umbrella-shaped patch was delivered along the catheter to the perforation site, expanding to a diameter of 17 millimeters. It sealed the hole from both sides of the muscle wall. The surgery, conducted under local anesthesia and mild sedation, lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes. The patient remained fully conscious throughout the procedure, listening to Mozart's symphonies.

　　不开胸的心脏修补手术
    新华社伦敦５月１７日电  （记者王国瑞）英国成功地进行了一例不用开胸修补成人心脏穿孔的手术。
    伦敦布鲁克医院的医生昨天对一名６６岁的妇女做了这种手术。她在去年９月心脏病发作，在左心室和右心室之间的心肌上形成穿孔。
    医生借助爱克斯光图，把一根细小的导管通过腹股沟处的小切口，插进静脉，一直插到心脏穿孔处。
    伞状修补块沿导管送到穿孔处，张开后直径１７毫米。在肌肉壁两侧，一边一个堵住孔洞。手术在局部麻醉和轻度镇静条件下进行了３小时４０分钟。手术中病人完全清醒，听着莫扎特交响乐。
