Cui Jinshan, a farmer from Jingjia Village in Qixia County, Shandong Province, along with his family of five, has worked tirelessly for four years to reclaim 60 mu of riverbank, establishing a small individual garden farm.

West of Jingjia Village is a river, with over 120 mu of barren land along its banks. In the spring of 1985, the village held a bidding process to contract the reclamation of the riverbank. Cui Jinshan, a 66-year-old, bid to reclaim 50 mu in 15 years, agreeing to pay the collective 15,000 yuan. Since then, he has led his wife and two adult children, using nothing but a hoe, a spade, and two small wheelbarrows, to level the gullies and ditches. They transported soil from a nearby small hill to the riverbank, spreading it to a thickness of over 40 centimeters. Out of the 60 mu, 20 mu of the better soil were planted with crops and vegetables, while 40 mu were planted with apples, peaches, and other fruits. Additionally, they dug a 300-meter irrigation canal and a 500-meter drainage ditch.

　　崔金山４年复垦河滩６０亩
    本报讯  山东省栖霞县京甲村农民崔金山一家５口苦干４年，复垦河滩６０亩，建成小型个体园艺场。
    京甲村村西是条河，河边有１２０多亩不毛之地。１９８５年春，村里招标承包复垦河滩，６６岁的崔金山老汉以１５年复垦５０亩、上交集体１５０００元承包下来。从那时起，他带领老伴和正值青年的一儿二女，靠着一镐一镢和两辆小推车，填平了沟沟坎坎，把邻近一座小山丘上的土全搬到河滩上，平铺４０多厘米厚。其中，２０亩土质好的种上庄稼、蔬菜，４０亩栽上苹果、桃子等，还挖了３００米水渠、５００米排涝沟。
