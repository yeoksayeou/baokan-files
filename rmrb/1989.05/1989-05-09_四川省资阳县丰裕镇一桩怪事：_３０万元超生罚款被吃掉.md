A strange incident has occurred in Fengyu Town, Ziyang County, Sichuan Province: 300,000 yuan in over-quota birth fines has been squandered.

According to a report, since 1987, Fengyu Town has used over 300,000 yuan in over-quota birth fines primarily for dining and awarding bonuses.

From April 1987 to September 1988, Fengyu Town collected 346,000 yuan in over-quota birth fines. This money was neither used to purchase specialized equipment for family planning nor for family planning propaganda and education. Instead, it was managed by the town's leaders, who issued unauthorized vouchers for reimbursement. They violated financial regulations, financial discipline, and the stipulations for the use of over-quota birth fines. Some used "white vouchers" for accounting, while others used the fines for dining and entertainment. In September 1988, the Ziyang County Tax Bureau discovered, during a review of invoices and the collection of unpaid taxes, that the town had used over-quota birth fines for dining and entertainment. The amount of non-compliant invoices alone totaled 57,000 yuan.

Additionally, one-third of the 300,000 yuan was used to award bonuses. The town's party committee decided that 15% of the over-quota birth fines would be awarded to villages and the town, which was reduced to 10% in March 1988. Thus, the more over-quota births, the more fines collected, and the more bonuses the officials received. It is understood that Fengyu Town has hundreds of over-quota births each year.

　　四川省资阳县丰裕镇一桩怪事：   
    ３０万元超生罚款被吃掉
    本报讯  四川省资阳县丰裕镇自１９８７年以来，将超生罚款３０多万元大部分用于吃喝、发奖金。
    丰裕镇１９８７年４月到１９８８年９月罚超生款３４．６万多元。这笔款，既没用来购置计划生育专用设施，也没用于计划生育宣传教育，而是由镇负责人“统管”，并乱批条子报帐。他们违反财务制度、财经纪律和超生罚款专用的规定，有的用“白条”作帐，有的用这罚款请吃请喝。去年９月，资阳县税务局在清查发票、查补偷漏税中发现，该镇用超生罚款吃喝的费用收据，光是不合规定的发票金额就有人民币５．７万多元。
    此外，３０多万元的开支有１／３用于发“奖金”。镇党委决定，超生罚款奖给村、镇１５％，１９８８年３月降至１０％。这样超生越多，罚款越多，干部得奖越多。据了解，丰裕镇每年超生数百个孩子。
