In the patriarchal feudal era, it was rare to find a family like that of the Ming Dynasty's Shen Yixiu, which had four female scholars.

Shen Yixiu, whose courtesy name was Wan Jun, was from Wuxi. Her works were fresh and elegant, free from the affectations of the boudoir, and she was known for her collection "Li Chui Ji." She also wrote 100 "Mei Hua Jue Ju" (absolute couplets about plum blossoms), which earned her a reputation among female writers. Under her influence, her three daughters also achieved great success in literature: the eldest, Ye Wanyuan, had "Fang Xue Xuan Yi Gao" (remnant works from the Fragrant Snow Pavilion); the second, Ye Xiaoyuan, was skilled in poetry and prose, and her play "Yuan Yang Meng" (Dream of Mandarin Ducks) was praised by later critics such as Jiang Ruizhao and Zheng Zhenqiu for being "clear and refined, rising above the mundane"; the third, Ye Xiaoluan, was exceptionally talented and eloquent. At the age of four, she could recite "Li Sao" (Encountering Sorrow), and at ten, she could write poetry. It is said that when she was ten, her father gave her the line "Gui Han Qing Lu Shi" (Frost on Osmanthus, Dew on Leaves), and she immediately responded with "Feng Lan Luan Hong Diao" (Maple Leaves Scatter Red), leaving behind "Shu Xiang Ge Yi Ji" (Remnant Works from the Fragrant Pavilion). Unfortunately, this gifted girl passed away at the age of 17. Her elder sister, Ye Wanyuan, also died at the age of 23 from excessive grief over her sister's death. The works of the four women were compiled and published as "Wu Meng Tang Quan Ji" (Complete Works of the Wu Meng Tang).

　　一门母女四文人
    在重男轻女的封建时代，象明末沈宜修这样一门母女４文人的情况，是不多见的。
    沈宜修，字宛君，吴江人。作品清新淡雅，脱去脂粉闺阁习气，著有《鹂吹集》，又有《梅花绝句》百首，在女流中颇负文名。在她的教育影响下，她的３个女儿在文学上也都卓有成就：长女叶纨纨，著有《芳雪轩遗稿》；次女叶小纨，不但工于诗词，而且擅长杂剧，其杂剧《鸳鸯梦》，被后世评论家蒋瑞藻、郑振铎等评为“清警拔俗”；三女叶小鸾更是文思敏捷，出语不凡。她４岁能诵《离骚》，１０岁能诗。相传她１０岁时，父亲出句“桂寒轻露湿”，她立即对道：“枫冷乱红凋”，有《疏香阁遗集》传世。遗憾的是这位才华横溢的少女，只活了１７岁就过早离开人世。姐姐叶纨纨也因哭妹过哀，发病而卒，年仅２３岁。母女４人作品结集合刻为《午梦堂全集》。
