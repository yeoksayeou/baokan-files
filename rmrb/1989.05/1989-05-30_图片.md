A Communist Party member from Shandong Province's Zhangqiu County, Sanjia Village, Ma Shikun, who has become wealthy through labor, donated 58,000 yuan this year to build a kindergarten for his village. This is him playing games with the children. A few years ago, he also invested more than 100,000 yuan to help the village school establish a factory. He said, "Every time I see the children happily going to school, my heart is filled with joy." Photo by Tao Junfeng.

    靠劳动致富的山东省章丘县三涧村农民、共产党员马世昆今年捐款五点八万元，为村里建了一座幼儿园。这是他与孩子们一起做游戏。几年前，他还出资十多万元帮助本村学校建了校办工厂。他说：“每当我看到孩子们高高兴兴去上学，心里就乐滋滋的。”陶峻峰摄
