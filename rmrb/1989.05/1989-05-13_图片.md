Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, adhering to the service tenet of "satisfying customers and fulfilling social responsibilities," is further improving its after-sales service to enhance the store's image. Recently, despite the tight financial situation, the store has specially allocated 100,000 yuan as a fund for exchanges and returns.
