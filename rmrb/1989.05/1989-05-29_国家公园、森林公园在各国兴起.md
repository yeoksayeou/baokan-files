Over the past few decades, as urbanization has progressed and populations have become highly concentrated, pollution and environmental hazards have become increasingly severe. Forests and green spaces have been continually reduced, and more and more people yearn for nature. "Returning to nature" has become a new aspiration for people. National parks and forest parks have developed in this context.

According to incomplete statistics, nearly a hundred countries around the world have established nearly a thousand national parks and forest parks, covering an area of over 220 million hectares, which accounts for 1.74% of the world's total land area.

The United States was the first country to establish national parks. In 1872, it completed the first park, Yellowstone National Park. The park not only has vast forests, shrubs, grasslands, and a large number of wild animals but also features the world-renowned "Old Faithful" geyser and other unique natural landscapes. The scenery is magnificent, attracting hundreds of millions of people from around the world each year to visit and sightsee. Currently, the U.S. government is increasingly emphasizing the construction of forest parks, investing tens of billions of dollars annually to build mountain trails, picnic spots, campsites, and winter sports facilities for visitors.

Japan began expanding the area of its forest parks in 1960. So far, it has designated 15% of its land area as forest parks for people to visit and relax. In 1980, the government designated suburban forest parks as places to improve the moral character, education, cultural arts, and health levels of young people. Nowadays, Japan sees approximately 800 million visits annually, with people of all ages bringing food and tents, flocking to various major forest parks across the country during holidays.

Australia has the most national parks and forest parks in the world, with a total of 243, covering an area of over 15 million hectares. The Royal National Park near Sydney is one of the world's earliest established national parks. The park is well-equipped, and over the years, it has become a popular tourist destination. The Australian government also stipulates that every year, primary and secondary school students must spend 1-2 weeks living in national parks and nature reserves. Through on-site visits, they cultivate a love for and protection of nature.

The construction of national parks and forest parks not only effectively protects forest resources and nature but also promotes the development of forest tourism. Each year, 300 million people in the United States visit parks for camping, hiking, photography, and wildlife viewing.

Currently, developing countries are actively building national parks and forest parks. Thailand currently has 14 forest parks where visitors can observe wild animals foraging at night, offering a unique experience. In Kenya's forest parks, there are tree-top hotels and hot air balloon rides to observe wildlife from the air. The foreign exchange earnings from these activities account for 20% of the country's total foreign exchange income, making it the second-largest source of foreign exchange after agriculture.

　　国家公园、森林公园在各国兴起
    韩惠正
    近几十年来，随着各国城市化的发展和人口的高度集中，污染与公害日益严重，森林、绿地不断减少，越来越多的人向往大自然。“回归大自然”成了人们新的愿望。国家公园、森林公园就是在这种形势下发展起来的。
    据不完全统计，全世界已有近百个国家兴建了近千处国家公园和森林公园，面积２．２亿多公顷，占世界总面积的１．７４％。
    美国是建立国家公园最早的国家。１８７２年建成了第一个公园——黄石国家公园。公园内不仅有大面积的森林、灌木丛、草原和大量的野生动物，还有闻名于世的“老忠诚”间歇泉等独特的自然风貌，景色十分壮观，每年吸引着全世界数百万人前来游览、观光。目前，美国政府越来越重视森林公园的建设，每年拿出的投资达数十亿美元，建造供游人散步的山间小道、野餐点、宿营地和冬季运动场。
    日本从１９６０年开始扩大森林公园的面积，到目前为止，已把占国土面积１５％的林地划为森林公园，供人们游览、休憩。１９８０年，政府又把市郊森林公园作为提高青少年情操、教育、文化艺术和健康水平的场所。现在日本每年约有８亿人次，在节假日扶老携幼，带着食品、帐篷，涌向全国各大森林公园。
    澳大利亚是全世界国家公园、森林公园最多的国家。全国共有２４３处，面积１５００多万公顷。位于悉尼市郊的澳大利亚皇家公园是世界最早建立的国家公园之一。公园内设施齐全，多年来已成为人们旅游的“热点”。澳大利亚政府还规定，每年中小学生都要到国家公园、自然保护区生活１—２个星期。通过实地参观等形式，培养他们热爱和保护大自然的意识。
    国家公园和森林公园的建设，不仅对森林资源和大自然进行了有效的保护，也促进了森林旅游业的发展。美国每年有３亿人次到公园去野营、爬山、摄影和观赏野生动物。
    目前，发展中国家已在积极兴建国家公园、森林公园。泰国现有森林公园１４处，游人可以在夜间观看野生动物觅食等生活情景，别有一番情趣。在肯尼亚的森林公园内设有树顶旅馆和乘大气球在空中观看野生动物的项目。每年由此获得的外汇收入占国家外汇总收入的２０％，成为仅次于农业的第二外汇来源。
