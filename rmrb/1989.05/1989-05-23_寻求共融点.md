The airport in Casablanca was filled with the private jets of Arab heads of state. Elderly Moroccans, dressed in white robes and red hats, repeatedly offered fresh milk and dates to the arriving presidents, kings, and emirs. President Mubarak's arrival in Morocco became a focal point of the news. Libyan leader Gaddafi, who had previously declared he would never meet with the Egyptian president, also stepped off his plane, drawing even more attention.

So far, the situation at this special summit of Arab leaders has become relatively clear. Regarding Egypt's formal return to the Arab League and promoting the easing of relations between Iran and Iraq, Arab countries have either reached a consensus or are likely to do so. The disagreements lie in the two difficult issues of Palestine and Lebanon.

The foreign ministers' meeting, which opened the day before yesterday, is currently synthesizing the three working documents submitted by the PLO, Syria, and Egypt on the Palestinian issue. It is reported that the three have different emphases, but their foundations are the same, such as demanding the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops from occupied territories; calling for the convening of a Middle East conference; supporting the Palestinian people's uprising, etc. Syria's working document still insists on "not excluding military options" and rejects political solutions without preconditions. The PLO proposes organizing an Arab joint delegation to participate in the Middle East conference and does not exclude elections under international supervision. However, attendees predict that the summit will not have difficulty coordinating these points and reaching a "unified stance" based on previous Arab League resolutions.

The Lebanese issue is tricky. The Arab League's recent mediation of the serious bloodshed between the two factions in Lebanon has not been effective. The six-nation committee led by the Kuwaiti foreign minister can only submit a working summary to the summit and cannot propose a solution. The focus is on the position of Syrian troops in Lebanon. According to reports, Jordan has submitted a document advocating that Arab peacekeeping forces replace Syrian troops in Lebanon. However, more people here estimate that even sending Arab observers to monitor the ceasefire in Lebanon is not feasible, and organizing Arab peacekeeping forces to enter Lebanon is even more difficult. Arab media personnel reveal that Egypt's return to the Arab League and Syria's continued presence in Lebanon have a tacit understanding. Moreover, the relationship between Syria and Iraq is also intertwined with the Lebanese crisis, adding to the difficulty of resolution. This dossier on Lebanon can only be left for the leaders to compromise and balance.

People have noticed that on the eve of the summit, Algeria, Syria, Libya, and Tunisia held a small summit, and the leaders of Egypt, Jordan, and Iraq also gathered in Casablanca. The political color of the Arab world is also becoming more intense. The Arab League organization faces the new task of coordinating the relationships between the Maghreb Union, the Arab Cooperation Council, and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

A Moroccan colleague told the reporter, "Arabs argue, but in the last 15 minutes, understanding on the resolution is always possible." "The real difficulty is in implementing the resolution." The reporter admires the keen observation and judgment of Arab colleagues and wishes the Arab countries to achieve solid results in their struggle for common national interests.

　　寻求共融点
    本报记者  林皎明
    卡萨布兰卡机场上停满了阿拉伯各国元首的专机，身穿白袍、头戴红帽的摩洛哥长者一次又一次把鲜奶和椰枣敬献给纷至沓来的总统、国王、埃米尔。穆巴拉克总统飞抵摩洛哥，一时成为新闻焦点。而一贯声称决不与埃及总统见面的利比亚卡扎菲也步下专机，更招来众人的注目。
    到目前为止，本届阿拉伯特别首脑会议的形势已大体明朗。有关埃及正式回归阿盟和促进两伊关系缓解，阿拉伯国家取得一致立场或已成为事实，或则容易实现。分歧在巴勒斯坦和黎巴嫩两个难题上。
    前天开幕的阿盟外长会议正在综合巴解组织、叙利亚和埃及对巴勒斯坦问题提出的３份工作文件。据透露，三者的倾向各有偏重，但基点是共同的，诸如要求以色列军队从被占领土全部撤出；呼吁召开中东和会；支持巴勒斯坦人民起义等。叙利亚的工作文件仍然坚持“不排除军事选择”，拒绝没有先决条件的政治解决。巴解组织提出组织阿拉伯联合代表团参加中东和会。不排除国际监督下的选举。但是，与会有关人士预测，首脑会议不难从中协调，在阿盟以往各次决议基础上达成“统一立场”。
    黎巴嫩问题是棘手的。阿盟前不久调解黎巴嫩两派严重流血冲突实际上没有收效。科威特外长率领的６国委员会只能向首脑会议递交一份工作总结，提不出解决方案。焦点集中于叙利亚军队在黎巴嫩的地位。据消息报道，约旦提出一份文件，主张由阿拉伯维持和平部队取代黎巴嫩的叙利亚部队。而更多的此间人士则估计，阿盟向黎巴嫩派出监督停火的观察员尚不得实施，组织阿拉伯维持和平部队进驻黎巴嫩更加难以实现。阿拉伯新闻界人士透露，埃及回归阿盟与叙利亚军队继续留在黎巴嫩两者之间有默契关系。更何况，叙利亚和伊拉克两国关系也与黎巴嫩危机绞在一起，增加解决难度。黎巴嫩这份卷宗，只能留待首脑们去折衷平衡。
    人们注意到，在首脑会议即将召开前夕，阿尔及利亚、叙利亚、利比亚和突尼斯召开小型首脑会，埃及、约旦和伊拉克３国元首也在卡萨布兰卡聚首。阿拉伯世界的集团政治色彩亦加浓重。阿盟组织面临协调马格里布联盟、阿拉伯合作委员会和海湾合作委员会之间关系的新课题。
    摩洛哥同行对记者说，“阿拉伯人吵归吵，但最后１５分钟在决议上谅解总是可能的。”“真正困难的是执行决议。”记者佩服阿拉伯同行敏锐的观察和判断力，祝愿阿拉伯国家为争取共同民族利益扎扎实实取得成果。
