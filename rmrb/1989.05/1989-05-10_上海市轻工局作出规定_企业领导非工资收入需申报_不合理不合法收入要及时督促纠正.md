Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Light Industry recently issued a document stipulating that the main party and government leaders of affiliated enterprises must timely declare their personal income, excluding salary, to the personnel management department. This practice of extending anti-corruption efforts to enterprises is unprecedented in Shanghai's industrial system.

According to a report by Wenhui News, the bureau has formulated the "Provisional Regulations on the Management of Personal Income of Main Party and Government Leaders in Enterprise Companies (Groups) and Enterprises." The regulations require over 400 affiliated enterprises' factory directors, managers, secretaries, and deputy leaders in charge of work to conscientiously uphold integrity and honesty in the context of reform and opening up, and not to arbitrarily decide their own income. The regulations stipulate that the basic salary, performance salary, and various allowances and subsidies of enterprise party and government leaders must be reported and approved by the superior authorities at different levels. The bonus income of enterprise party and government leaders must be included in the specific bonus distribution plan of the unit, and the plan must be approved through democratic procedures and by the superior authorities. Enterprise party and government leaders are not allowed to receive any remuneration from joint venture units and cooperative units, including bonuses, nominal wages, and consulting service fees.

The regulations of Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Light Industry require enterprise leaders to truthfully declare their personal income, excluding salary, to the personnel management department, and to timely fill out the "Personal Income Declaration Form." If any unreasonable or illegal income is discovered, the superior management department is responsible for supervising and rectifying it. Those who do not rectify will be subject to disciplinary action.

    企业领导非工资收入需申报    
    不合理不合法收入要及时督促纠正
    本报讯  上海市轻工业局日前发文规定，所属企业的党政主要领导要及时向干部管理部门申报个人除工资性收入外的各种收入。这种将廉政建设延伸到企业的做法，在上海市工业系统尚无先例。
    据文汇报报道：该局制订的《关于加强企业性公司（集团）和企业的党政主要领导个人收入管理的暂行规定》，要求４００多家局属企业的厂长、经理、书记以及主持工作的副职，在改革开放的形势下，自觉做到廉洁奉公，不能擅自决定自己的收入。《规定》提出，企业党政主要领导的基本工资、效益工资和各种津贴、补贴，要报上级分级审批；企业党政主要领导的奖金收入，要列入本单位奖金发放具体方案，方案需通过民主程序和上级批准；企业党政主要领导不能到联营单位和协作单位领取任何报酬，包括对方发放的奖金、挂名工资和咨询服务费等。
    上海市轻工业局的《规定》要求企业领导实事求是地向干部管理部门申报个人除工资性收入外的各种收入，及时填写“个人收入申报表”，如发现不合理、不合法的收入，由上级管理部门负责督促纠正，不纠正者，作违纪处理。
