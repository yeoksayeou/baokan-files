On the morning of May 8th, the radio broadcasted news of a righteous individual who, after performing a good deed, was delayed in receiving treatment at the Luo Yang People's Hospital due to the hospital's insistence on payment before treatment, ultimately leading to his death. At that time, the reporter was conducting an interview at the 18th Engineering Bureau of the Southern Railway Department in Tianjin. Coincidentally, a woman who had been severely injured by a car, was unconscious, and had no identification or money, was brought to the hospital and needed urgent brain surgery.

"Treat first, pay later," said the chief physician of the surgery department, Liu Jimin, who immediately signed the approval and began the rapid rescue process...

In this place, everything seemed natural and harmonious. Just last year on New Year's Eve, a large bus encountered a middle-aged man who had been hit by a motorcycle. The culprit fled, leaving the injured man with dilated pupils and bleeding from the mouth and nose, to the point that even the traffic police who arrived thought he might not survive. Without family members present, if the surgery went wrong, the hospital would be held legally responsible, and no one would be responsible for the payment. At this point, the patient had stopped breathing...

In this situation where the injured person's name, workplace, and guarantor were all unknown, the hospital director and the department head decisively sent the patient to the operating table for brain surgery. After two days and nights of continuous rescue, the head was sutured with 82 stitches, and the fractured femur was cleaned and reconnected. Finally, the patient was revived. When the family members were in deep sorrow preparing for the funeral, they saw their loved one recovering and could not help but shed tears of joy, kneeling before the exhausted medical staff...

"This is what we should do. We believe that if a society or a nation only cares about money and cannot save lives, then the spirit of that nation will also degenerate and collapse. For a righteous individual who was delayed in treatment and died, that is a crime!" Li Cunle, deputy secretary of the 18th Engineering Bureau Party Committee, sighed. He jokingly told the reporter:

"We are a bureau that was converted from the military, and many of our ideas haven't caught up with the market economy."

This joke indeed raises a sharp question: Does the development of a market economy conflict with the practice of saving lives?

The reporter learned from the Tianjin Municipal Health Bureau that in 1988, there were over 100 cases in the city's hospitals where patients who were admitted for emergency treatment ended up owing money, with some patients even slipping away quietly at night. Taking the First Central Hospital as an example, such cases accounted for about 2% of the total. This poses a threat to the already tight medical funds of the hospitals. How to strengthen legal regulations and moral education in this regard is also an urgent issue that needs to be addressed. The behavior of forcing hospitals to provide free services is absurd. However, the Tianjin Municipal Health Department believes that it is absolutely not acceptable to change the sacred duty of medical institutions to save lives and promote revolutionary humanitarianism due to the illegal behavior of a few individuals. Since 1987, Tianjin has clearly stipulated the first-responsibility system, where any hospital that accepts emergency patients cannot delay treatment for any reason, and whoever is responsible will be held accountable.

When discussing these issues, Deputy Director Pan of the 18th Engineering Bureau Hospital said: "We should trust the majority of the people. For example, the medical expenses of the worker who was injured in the car accident mentioned earlier, totaling 3,400 yuan, were quickly paid by his family."

A responsible comrade from the bureau party committee said: "Of course, society is complex. Sometimes the hospital and the state also have to bear some losses. But if we only care about money and abandon medical ethics, the loss would be even greater. It can be said that money can be recovered, but medical ethics cannot be compensated."

This hospital also had an incident—

In March of this year, someone from Nanjiao Shuanggang Bai Tangkou came to the hospital to buy winter sleep medicine for their mother. The on-duty internal medicine doctor, Wang Minghui, did not simply prescribe the medicine but found discrepancies between the village doctor's prescription and the patient's symptoms. He then called the department head, Dr. Tian, and together they went to the patient's home to examine her. They discovered that the old woman's "Guillain-Barré syndrome" had been misdiagnosed as a mental illness by the village doctor, and taking winter sleep medicine would be life-threatening. The old woman had come to the hospital to save money for her son's wedding. Dr. Tian took timely measures to treat the old woman at home, and with only one month and over 100 yuan in medical fees, the old woman recovered.

The inner satisfaction that doctors receive is priceless.

　　医德反差录
    本报记者  肖荻
    ５月８日早晨。广播中传出一位见义勇为的志士在洛阳人民医院被强调先交钱才治病的医护人员延误致死的消息，记者正在天津南部铁道部第１８工程局进行采访。恰好，这里的医院来了个被汽车严重撞伤、身份不明、分文未带且昏迷不醒的妇女，需抓紧进行开颅手术。
    “先抢救，后收费。”外科主治大夫柳吉明迅即签署意见，随之展开快节奏的急救……
    在这里，这一切好像是理所当然，相互默契。就在去年除夕之夜，一辆大客车路遇一中年人被摩托撞倒。祸主逃窜不知去向，伤者瞳孔散大、口鼻流血，连交通队来的民警都认为可能没救了。在家属没找到时，如动手术有误，医院要承担法律责任，至于交费更无人负责，这时病人已停止呼吸……就在这种连伤员姓名、单位、担保人均空白的情况下，院长、科主任当机立断将伤员送上手术台开颅，连续抢救两昼夜，仅头部就缝了８２针，并为伤员作了粉碎性大腿骨折的清理和连接，终于使其起死回生。当家属悲痛欲绝准备料理后事时，却见亲人正在恢复，不禁热泪奔涌，向着疲惫的医护人员跪倒……
    “这是我们应当作的。我们认为一个社会、一个民族如果单纯为了钱而不能救死扶伤，那这个民族的精神也就堕落了、瓦解了。对于一位见义勇为的伤者被拖延医治致死，那更是犯罪！”１８工程局党委副书记李存乐同志感慨系之。他不无幽默地向记者开玩笑：
    “我们这个局是军队转过来的，好多观念还没跟上商品经济。”
    这个玩笑确实提出一个尖锐的问题：发展商品经济和实行救死扶伤究竟有无矛盾？
    记者在天津市卫生局了解到这样一个数字：去年全年在全市各医院中因发生急症收院治疗，最后发生欠资扯皮的共达１００多万元，个别病员晚间卷起被褥悄悄溜掉的也有。以第一中心医院而言，全年发生上述欠资行为的达２％左右。这对于本来经费就相当拮据的医疗单位也构成一定的威胁。对此，如何在法制规范和道德教育上加强，也都是亟待解决的课题。那种强使医院“无偿”为我服务的行为是荒谬的。但是尽管如此，天津市卫生部门认为，绝不能因极少数人的不轨行为而改变医疗单位救死扶伤、发扬革命人道主义的神圣天职。从１９８７年天津明确规定了首诊负责制，凡接受急诊的医院不能因故拖延治疗，谁出事要追究责任。
    当谈到这些情况时，１８工程局医院潘副院长说：“应当相信群众的绝大多数。比如前面所谈那位遭车祸职工所用医疗费３４００元，家属很快送来了。”
    局党委一位负责同志说：“当然，社会是复杂的。有时医院、国家也要付出一些损失。但如果因此就认钱不认人，抛弃医德，那损失就更严重。可以说，钱丢了还可补回来，医德丢了难以补偿。”
    这个医院还有过这样一件事——
    今年３月，南郊双港白塘口有人来医院为其母亲买冬眠灵。值班内科医师王明晖没有简单开药了事，在询问病情时发现村医所开药方与来人所谈病情不符，便找来科主任田大夫一起乘车去病家诊视，发现老人所患“格林巴利综合症”被村医误诊为精神病，如服用冬眠灵会发生生命危险。那位老人是为了节省花费给儿子办婚事才不来医院的。老田及时采取措施使其在家中得到治疗，仅用一个月和１００多元诊治费就使老人康复。
    医生们得到的内心满足感，是无价的。
