People's Daily, Rome, May 20th - Italian Prime Minister Giovanni Goria submitted his resignation to President Francesco Cossiga yesterday afternoon. According to tradition, Cossiga accepted the resignation with reservations and asked Goria to continue handling daily government affairs. Cossiga will begin consultations with various political parties next week.

The conflict between the Socialist Party and the Christian Democratic Party is the main cause of this Italian government crisis. The 45th Congress of the Socialist Party, which concluded yesterday, strongly criticized the Goria government for being "slow" in implementing plans and carrying out institutional reforms, stating that the Goria government had "reached its terminal point" and demanding that Goria immediately convene a cabinet meeting for "political clarification." Goria, in his statement after submitting his resignation to Cossiga, said his resignation was a "necessary result of the stance taken by the Socialist Party Congress."

The Goria government was formed on April 13, 1988, and includes the Christian Democratic Party, Socialist Party, Social Democratic Party, Republican Party, and Liberal Party.

　　社会党和天民党矛盾激化
  　意大利总理辞职
  　科西加总统接受德米塔辞呈
    本报罗马５月２０日电  记者罗晋标报道：意大利政府总理德米塔昨天下午向科西加总统提出辞职。按照惯例，科西加总统有保留地接受辞职，请德米塔总理继续主持政府日常工作。科西加总统将于下星期一开始与各政党磋商。
    社会党和天民党之间发生矛盾是导致这次意大利政府危机的主要原因。昨天闭幕的社会党第４５次代表大会强烈批评德米塔政府在执行计划，实行体制改革等方面行动“迟缓”，认为德米塔政府“到终点站了”，要求德米塔总理立即召开内阁会议进行“政治澄清”。德米塔在向科西加总统提出辞呈后发表的声明称其辞职是“社会党代表大会所采取的立场得出的必要结果”。
    德米塔政府于１９８８年４月１３日组成，参加政府的有天民党、社会党、社民党、共和党、自由党。
