Hope in the Stone Nooks

By Zhu Weiqun, People's Daily Reporter

"High mountains for the Miao, water for the Han, and the Gelao live in the stone nooks." History has left the ancient Gelao people with a harsh environment. Pingzheng Gelao Township in Zunyi County, Guizhou, is located in the Dalou Mountain range. The elevation within the township ranges from 800 meters to 1,500 meters.

As we trekked along the mountain path, looking up, we saw a misty rain covering the mountains with stones; looking down from a high point, we discovered a series of winding stone terraces surrounding fish-scale-like plots of land. The largest plots are only half a mu, and the smallest are no bigger than a washbasin. Only around the township government is there a patch of relatively flat paddy fields.

The Gelao people are one of the oldest indigenous groups in Guizhou. Pingzheng Township was established as a Gelao ethnic township as early as 1956. Here, many farmers have surnames like Shan, Gang, Tian, and Sang, reflecting the living habits and agricultural traditions of this ethnic group.

Pingzheng is a poor township, with an average of only 500 jin of grain per person, and 34% of the population still faces food shortages. This harsh reality is due to the high-altitude, isolated geographical environment, as well as the destruction caused by the Cultural Revolution and the backward state of science, technology, and education. Gelao farmers have long remained at a primitive level of farming, planting only one crop of corn a year and neglecting the fields once the seeds are sown. According to local officials, within the same village, the per capita income and grain and tobacco yields per unit area of Gelao farmers are significantly lower than those of Han farmers.

What is encouraging is that reform has brought modern agricultural technology to this remote stone mountain area. Although changes here are relatively slow, they have indeed brought hope to the Gelao people.

Those who first dared to adopt external technologies were those with education or who had experienced the outside world. Xiong Yongfu, a demobilized soldier from Pingxin Village, with the help of the township agricultural technology station, was the first to start raising tobacco seedlings in nutrient trays and planting hybrid corn and hybrid rice. This land, which had never been nourished by modern technology, showed remarkable results once new technologies were applied. Old Xiong's tobacco yield increased by onefold, corn by more than threefold, and rice by 50%. The family had surplus grain and cash income, escaping poverty. Under their leadership and teaching, these technologies have been popularized in all 30-plus households in the village. Previously, half of the households in this village lacked grain, but now fewer than five households are short of grain. Old Xiong has an initial education level, and in the village, he is considered a person of culture. He is very confident and plans to try water rice two-stage seedling cultivation, corn seedling transplantation, and dry land strip rotation multi-cropping this year. If successful, he will promote these technologies to the entire village.

Pang Benguo, the director of the agricultural technology station, said that there are more than 70 such technology demonstration households in the entire township, including more than 20 Gelao households, who have played a significant role in leading the masses out of poverty. Last year, Pingzheng Township held eight training sessions for technical backbones, and in addition, more than 1,300 farmers learned five key technologies through various forms of training.

Pingzheng Township's altitude is suitable for lacquer tree growth. As early as the Tang Dynasty, lacquer was produced here, and farmers have the tradition of planting lacquer trees. In recent years, lacquer tree cultivation training classes and lacquer factories have been established here. The township has also set up a lacquer tree research station, and the number of lacquer trees in the entire township has increased from 140,000 to 560,000.

The popularization of technology is based on people's cultural and educational levels. The Gelao people now feel more acutely the pain of educational backwardness. The enrollment rate in this township is 90%, but poverty forces many children to take on the burden of supporting the family at an early age, leading to a high dropout rate. Less than 60% of primary school students advance to junior high school, and only a few can go on to senior high school. A teacher at Pingzheng Ethnic Middle School told me that there is no high school here, and to attend high school, one must go to Yaxi or Panxian District, dozens of miles away, making it very difficult to persist. The ethnic middle school, with only four junior high school classes, is facing the danger of collapse due to severe shortages of teachers and funds. They appeal that the state should support the education of minority and backward regions as a fundamental measure to help them escape poverty and develop the economy, and should not neglect this work again.

　　石旮旯里的希望
    本报记者  朱维群
    “高山苗，水汉家，仡佬住在石旮旯。”历史给古老的仡佬族留下一个艰苦的生存环境。贵州遵义县平正仡佬乡，地处大娄山脉，一个乡的范围海拔落差竟在８００米到１５００米之间。
    我们跋涉在进山路上，抬头望，蒙蒙细雨下，遍山都是石头；登高俯视，才发现那是一道道弯弯曲曲的石坝，围着鱼鳞般的小块田土。大者不过半亩，小者只有澡盆大小，仅仅在乡政府周围才有一片平整一点的水田。
    仡佬族是贵州历史最悠久的土著之一。平正乡早在１９５６年就建立仡佬民族乡。这里农民姓山、岗、田、桑的多，也反映了这个民族的居住特点和农桑传统。
    平正是个贫困乡，人均占有粮食仅５００多斤，３４％的人尚未解决温饱问题。这个严酷事实的背后，是高寒、闭塞的地理环境，也与“文革”的破坏、科技文教事业落后密切相关。仡佬族农民长期停留在原始的耕作水平上，一年只种一季苞谷，种子下地就不管了。据乡里同志说，在同一村寨里，仡佬族农民的人均收入和粮食、烤烟的单位面积产量都明显低于汉族农民。
    令人欣喜的是，改革把现代农业科技送到了这僻远的石头山区。虽然这里的变化还比较缓慢，但是它确实给仡佬人带来了希望。
    最先大胆接受外来技术的，是那些有文化或在外面世界闯荡过的人。平心村退伍军人熊永福，在乡农科站的帮助下，率先搞起烤烟营养钵育苗，种上杂交玉米、杂交水稻。这片未经科技甘霖滋润过的土地，一旦使用新技术，效果特别好。老熊家的烤烟单产比往年增加一倍，苞谷增加３倍多，水稻增加５０％，全家有了余粮，有了现金收入，摆脱了贫困。在他们带动传授下，这几项技术在全村３０多户中普及开来。过去这个村有一半农户缺粮，现在缺粮的已不到５户。老熊上过初中，在村里就算是文化人了。他很有信心，今年打算试试水稻两段育秧、玉米育苗移栽和旱地分带轮作多熟制等几项技术，成功后，就向全村推广。
    农技站站长潘本国说，像他这样的科技示范户全乡有７０多个，其中仡佬族有２０多户，他们对带领群众脱贫起了很大作用。去年，平正乡搞了８次技术骨干集中培训，此外，还有１３００多农民以各种形式学习了５项重点推广的技术。
    平正乡海拔高度适合漆树生长，远在唐代这里就生产生漆，农民有种植漆树的传统。近几年这里办起漆树栽培训练班，办起漆厂，乡里还办起一所漆树科研站，全乡漆树已从１４万株发展到５６万株。
    科技普及是以人的文化、知识水平为基础的，仡佬族如今更深切感到教育落后的痛楚。这个乡入学率虽达９０％，但贫穷迫使不少孩子过早地分担养家糊口的担子，中途辍学较多，小学升初中的不到６０％，其中能上到高中的不过数人。平正民族中学的老师告诉我，这里没有高中，要上高中必须到几十里外的鸭溪、泮水区去，委实很难坚持。仅有４个初中班的民族中学，由于师资、经费极其困难，也面临垮台的危险。他们呼吁，国家应把支持少数民族落后地区的教育事业，作为帮助他们脱离贫困、发展经济的根本措施之一，千万不能再忽视这项工作了。
