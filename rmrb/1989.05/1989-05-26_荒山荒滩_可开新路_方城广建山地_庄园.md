While many places are seeing rural surplus laborers flocking to cities, farmers in Fangcheng County, Henan Province, are instead marching towards barren mountains and sands with hoes and picks.

According to the Henan Daily, currently, over 100,000 rural surplus laborers in the county are engaged in developing barren mountains and sands. Among them, 600 households and 2,000 people have set up camp on the mountains, planting trees, growing grass, raising livestock, and cultivating land. They have built 600 small mountain estates, developing 160,000 mu of barren mountains and sands.

Today, upon arriving in the mountainous areas of Fangcheng County, one can see these newly built houses by the farmers in the valleys and at the foot of the mountains. Some are tile-roofed, while others are mud-walled thatched cottages; thorny hedges wind around, each forming its own estate. Among them, fruit trees cast green shadows, smoke rises gently, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard from time to time. Locals call these mountain "estates."

These small estates generally require minimal investment, a lot of labor, and yield good returns. Usually, an investment of 300 to 500 yuan is enough to start a mountain estate, and it can show significant results in three to five years. If short-term investments are used to support long-term gains, the estate can show results in the same year it is established. Farmers say, "Building a small mountain estate is like opening a small bank!" Experts estimate that the several hundred small mountain estates in Fangcheng County have an annual output value of over 20 million yuan.

Fangcheng farmers are eager to develop barren mountains and sands because the county has formulated a series of policies to encourage farmers to develop the mountains. These policies include separating mountain ownership from management rights, allowing mountain leasing and cross-regional contracting for periods of 30 to 50 years; whoever develops the mountain benefits from it, and the development results can be inherited or transferred. For farmers developing the mountains, relevant departments provide support in terms of funds, technology, and seedlings. Newly reclaimed land is exempt from agricultural tax, special product tax, and deductions for three years after it starts yielding results.

### 荒山荒滩　可开新路  方城广建山地“庄园”

　　荒山荒滩　可开新路
    方城广建山地“庄园”
    本报讯  当许多地方的农村剩余劳力纷纷向城市涌流的时候，河南省方城县的农民却荷锄肩镐向荒山荒滩进军了。
    据河南日报报道，目前，全县从事开发荒山荒滩的农村剩余劳力在１０万人以上，其中在山上安营扎寨的有６００户、２０００多人，他们或植树造林，或种草养畜，或垦地种粮，共建小山庄６００个，开发荒山荒滩１６万多亩。
    今天，来到方城县山区，山坳里、山脚下，不时可见这些农民新建的房子，有的青堂瓦舍，有的泥墙茅屋；棘篱盘绕，各自成庄。其间林果绿荫掩映，炊烟袅袅，鸡犬之声时闻，当地人称之为山地“庄园”。
    这些小庄园普遍投资少，用劳力多，效益好。一般情况，投资三五百元便可上山办山庄，三五年可大见效。若是搞以短养长，当年上山当年即可见效。农民说，建一个小山庄就等于开一个“小银行”！行家估算，方城县这几百个小山庄，一年的产值在２０００万元以上。
    方城农民踊跃开发荒山荒滩，在于县里制订有一系列鼓励农民上山搞开发的好政策：实行山地所有权与经营权分离，允许山地租赁、跨地区承包，使用期可达３０—５０年；谁开发谁受益，开发成果可以继承转让；对开发山地的农户，有关部门负责提供资金、技术、种苗等方面的扶持；新开荒地见效后３年内，不缴农业税、特产税，也不缴提留。
