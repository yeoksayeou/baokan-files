Foreign Ministry Spokesperson on the Discrepancies in the Consultations Between Chinese and Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Ministers

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 11 - The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that Deputy Foreign Minister Liu Shucai of China and First Deputy Foreign Minister Ding Ruolian of Vietnam held consultations in Beijing from May 8 to 10 on the political settlement of the Cambodian issue, but no substantial progress was made and no agreement was reached.

He said, the Chinese side pointed out that Vietnam's announcement of withdrawing all troops from Cambodia by the end of this September is welcome. We hope the Vietnamese side will take concrete actions and withdraw all armed forces, including all military personnel and equipment, from Cambodia on schedule. The withdrawal of Vietnamese troops should be conducted under effective international supervision, and they should not return under any pretext after withdrawal. The Vietnamese side reiterated that it would withdraw all troops from Cambodia by the end of this September but refused to make a commitment that the Vietnamese military would not return to Cambodia in any form.

He said, regarding the issue of international supervision and international conferences, both sides agreed to establish an effective international supervision mechanism for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the cessation of military aid from foreign countries, the maintenance of peace in Cambodia, and free elections. It is hoped that after the relevant parties reach a consensus on the principles through consultations, an international conference on the Cambodian issue can be convened as soon as possible. The Chinese side believes that the United Nations and the United Nations Secretary-General should play a role in this regard. The Vietnamese side expressed disagreement with this.

He said, the Chinese side emphasized that the serious consequences caused by Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia over the past 10 years must be eliminated, and Vietnam bears an unshirkable responsibility for preventing internal war among the Cambodian factions. The Chinese side believes that establishing a temporary joint government led by Prince Sihanouk, and freezing and reducing the Cambodian forces of the four factions, are effective measures to maintain peace in Cambodia and prevent internal war. The Vietnamese side avoided discussing this.

He said, the Vietnamese side advocated that the Cambodian issue should not hinder the improvement of Sino-Vietnamese relations. The Chinese side expressed that only when the Cambodian issue is fully, fairly, and reasonably resolved, Sino-Vietnamese relations can be normalized. He said: Due to the attitude of the Vietnamese side, the consultations did not achieve positive results, and it was not determined whether further consultations would be held.

　　外交部发言人谈    
    中越副外长磋商分歧所在
    新华社北京５月１１日电  外交部发言人今天说，中国外交部副部长刘述卿同越南外交部第一副部长丁儒廉于５月８日至１０日在北京就政治解决柬埔寨问题进行的磋商没有取得实质性进展，没有达成什么协议。
    他说，中国方面指出，越南方面宣布今年９月底以前从柬埔寨全部撤军是值得欢迎的。希望越南方面见诸行动，如期从柬撤出所有武装力量，包括全部军事人员和军事装备。越南撤军要在有效的国际监督下进行，撤出后不应以任何借口重返。越方重申将于今年９月底以前从柬全部撤军，但拒绝就越南军队将不以任何方式重返柬埔寨做出承诺。
    他说，关于国际监督和国际会议问题，双方同意对越南撤军、外国停止军事援助、维护柬国内和平及自由选举建立有效的国际监督机制，希望在有关各方通过协商达成原则协议后尽快召开一次关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议。中方认为应当发挥联合国和联合国秘书长在这方面的作用。对此越南方面表示不能同意。
    他说，中方强调越南侵柬１０年所造成的严重后果必须消除，对防止柬各派之间发生内战，越南负有不可推卸的责任。中方认为，建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府、对柬埔寨四方军队实行冻结和裁减，是维护柬埔寨和平和防止内战的有效措施。越南方面对此回避讨论。
    他说，越方主张不应让柬埔寨问题阻碍中越两国关系的改善。中方表示，只有柬埔寨问题得到全面公正合理的解决，中越关系才有可能实现正常化。他说：由于越南方面所持的态度，磋商未能取得积极成果，没有确定是否再次进行磋商的问题。
