Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 10th. People's Daily reporters He Ping and Mao Lei report: At today's national conference on secrecy work, Shen Hongying, Director of the State Secrecy Bureau, proposed that efforts should be made to establish a comprehensive set of regulations to implement the "State Secrets Law of the People's Republic of China" within three to five years or even less, thereby creating a viable system of secrecy regulations.

The State Secrets Law came into effect on May 1st of this year.

Shen Hongying pointed out that the main tasks for secrecy work in the coming period are to earnestly implement the State Secrets Law, strengthen legal construction, improve the secrecy mechanism, develop secrecy technology, and gradually make secrecy work legalized, standardized, and scientific.

In analyzing the current situation of secrecy work, Shen Hongying warned that intelligence theft activities during peacetime, just like those during wartime, pose a serious threat to the country's security and interests.

He revealed that in the future, based on the provisions of the State Secrets Law and its implementation measures, the adjustment of secrecy classifications will be treated as a regular task. Through this work, the past phenomena of overly broad secrecy scopes, excessively high secrecy classifications, lack of uniformity, and lifelong secrecy classifications will be corrected.

Luogan, Secretary-General of the State Council, and leaders from relevant departments, as well as representatives from relevant sectors, totaling 360 people, attended the meeting.

　　保密法规体系三五年内配套
    本报北京５月１０日讯  新华社记者何平、本报记者毛磊报道：国家保密局局长沈鸿英在今天召开的全国保密工作会议上提出，要争取在三至五年或更短的时间，把贯彻实施《中华人民共和国保密法》各方面的配套制度搞好，建成一套可行的保密法规体系。
    保密法是今年５月１日开始实施的。
    沈鸿英指出，今后一个时期保密工作的任务是：认真贯彻实施保密法，加强法制建设，完善保密机制，发展保密技术，逐步使保密工作法制化、规范化、科学化。
    在分析当前保密工作形势时，沈鸿英告诫人们，和平时期的情报窃密活动与战争年代一样，对国家的安全和利益构成严重威胁。
    他透露，今后将根据保密法及其实施办法的规定，把密级的调整作为经常性的工作。通过划密工作，纠正过去那种秘密范围过宽、密级偏高和不统一以及密级一定终身的现象。
    国务院秘书长罗干和有关部门领导同志及有关方面３６０多人参加了会议。
