An Encounter of a Paralyzed Patient on a Train

Lan Bu Xu, a member of the Science and Technology Association in my county, was unfortunately paralyzed in a car accident. His lower limbs are paralyzed.

On January 7th of this year, Lan Bu Xu, accompanied by his friend Lan Xin Shu, traveled to Anyang, Henan, to seek medical treatment. On their return, they boarded the Beijing to Changsha No. 1 express train. Since they boarded in the middle of the journey, the train was full, and Lan Xin Shu struggled to find a seat while carrying Lan Bu Xu. They walked through five carriages, asking passengers for help, but no one responded. Most passengers gave them disgusted looks, and a few young people even mocked them with derisive words. Exhausted, Lan Xin Shu had to place Lan Bu Xu, who had just undergone surgery 10 days prior, in the aisle. Lan Bu Xu groaned in pain, but no one offered help. Lan Xin Shu sought assistance from the train crew, and the train conductor immediately issued them a hard sleeper ticket. Since there was only an upper berth available, the conductor asked them to negotiate with other passengers in the hard sleeper carriage to exchange for a lower berth. Lan Xin Shu, carrying Lan Bu Xu, pleaded with each passenger in the narrow aisle of the hard sleeper carriage, almost asking every passenger with a lower berth, but the response was always "No!" Just as they were at a loss, a young female train attendant came along. She proactively asked Lan Xin Shu about their difficulties and then negotiated with each passenger with a lower berth, explaining Lan Bu Xu's condition and their current predicament. After more than 20 minutes of patient persuasion, a middle-aged man in compartment 16 finally agreed to exchange berths. The female train attendant then asked the passengers to help lift Lan Bu Xu to the berth. At this moment, Lan Bu Xu was extremely grateful, but all he could say was, "Thank you, attendant." When he wanted to ask the female train attendant's name, she had already turned and left, leaving only the number "376" on her chest badge deeply imprinted in Lan Bu Xu's mind.

　　一个瘫痪病人在列车上的遭遇
    我县科协兰卜旭同志在一次车祸事故中不幸致残，下肢瘫痪。
    今年１月７日，兰卜旭由亲友兰新树陪同，来到河南安阳市求医。回家时，他们乘的是北京至长沙的１次特快列车。由于是中途上车，车厢内座无虚席，兰新树背着兰卜旭艰难地在各车厢穿行，以寻求一个座位。他们走了５节车厢，向旅客们寻求帮助，但无一人理睬。大多数旅客向他们投去的是讨厌的目光，少数青年还用讥笑的言词加以戏弄。兰新树精疲力尽了，只好将做完手术仅１０天的兰卜旭放在车厢过道上。兰卜旭在痛苦地呻吟着，却无一人伸出同情援助之手。兰新树向列车员求援，列车长当即给他们办了一张硬卧票。因只有上铺，列车长让他们到硬卧车厢与其他旅客商量，调换一个下铺。兰新树又背着兰卜旭在狭窄的硬卧车厢过道中逐个地哀求，几乎求遍了所有下铺乘客，但回答都是“不行！”正在为难之际，来了一位年轻的女列车员，她主动向兰新树询问困难，然后又与下铺乘客逐个商量，讲明兰卜旭的病情以及现在的难处，经过她２０多分钟耐心说服，１６组下铺的一位中年人终于同意调换铺位。这位女列车员又请乘客帮忙把兰卜旭抬到铺位上。此时此刻的兰卜旭感激万分，可口里只会说：“服务员同志，谢谢你”。当他想问女列车员姓名时，她已经转身离去，只有“３７６”这个胸号，深深印在兰卜旭头脑中。
