Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th.

A grand cultural project, the "Comprehensive Works on Confucius Culture," is being meticulously constructed by the editorial department of the "Comprehensive Works on Confucius Culture" at the Shandong Publishing House and is transitioning from a blueprint to reality. The first phase of the project plans to publish 500 books, totaling 400 volumes and 100 million characters, over the course of 10 years.

This is a monumental collection that gathers the treasures of Chinese literature over thousands of years. It primarily consists of books, supplemented by audio-visual materials, handicrafts, and Confucian cuisine. The first batch of 19 books, totaling 42 volumes, was published in July of last year and has been widely welcomed both domestically and internationally. The second batch of books, totaling 38 titles and 35 volumes, is scheduled to be published in September. Some of these books are either being published for the first time or are rare and precious editions, making them particularly valuable.
