According to predictions, by the end of this century, primary energy will require at least 1.47 billion tons of standard coal, of which 700 million tons will need to be produced by small coal mines. Currently, many small coal mines are plagued by poor management and outdated technology, and it is imperative to strengthen management and provide support.

There is much criticism of small coal mines, mainly that they severely damage resources and have frequent accidents. This simplistic negative attitude is unfair.

By ownership, small coal mines can be divided into two main categories: local state-owned coal mines, including those operated by provinces (municipalities, districts), prefectures, counties, and various industries as state-owned enterprises; and township coal mines, including those collectively owned by villages and towns, as well as those operated by individuals or joint-stock partnerships.

Over the years, both types of coal mines have developed rapidly. Currently, there are over 80,000 mines of various types nationwide, with a total geological reserve of 98.5 billion tons, employing approximately 3.4 million people, and producing over 510 million tons annually, which accounts for more than half of the national coal production of 970 million tons. Of this, local state-owned small coal mines produce 190 million tons, and township collective and individual coal mines produce 320 million tons.

The rise of small coal mines has played a crucial role in alleviating the energy crisis, meeting people's living needs, helping farmers escape poverty and become prosperous, and supporting local industrial and agricultural production.

Moreover, the increase in production by small coal mines has been achieved without significant state investment. Currently, building a state-owned large mine requires at least 8 years and an investment of several billion yuan, while a small mine with an annual production of 5-6 million tons can be built and put into operation within a year. Relying on local and individual mining is a cost-effective and quick way to solve energy problems.

Of course, it must be acknowledged that small coal mines have inherent weaknesses, with outdated equipment and poor safety conditions. Many small coal mines are poorly managed, especially township coal mines. In some places, there is no unified planning, and necessary approvals and technical assessments are lacking, leading to blind exploitation and reckless mining. One important reason for this situation is that some comrades have opposed relaxing policies with strengthening management, leading to lax management. It is necessary to strengthen rectification. The Fengfeng Mining District in Hebei's Handan, for example, previously had chaotic small coal mine operations and severe resource disputes. In 1984 and 1985, there were 154 resource disputes involving large and small mines, resulting in economic losses of 30 million yuan. In the past two years, the local government and mining bureau have jointly conducted strict rectification. Now, mining is orderly, management is disciplined, and production is in good order, protecting national resources while developing coal production. Shandong Province has implemented unified management of state-allocated coal mines, local coal mines, and township coal mines, strengthening industry management. These experiences in strengthening the management of small coal mines are worth emulating.

Most of China's small coal mines were hastily established and developed with limited resources, resulting in inherent weaknesses in mine construction. It is urgent to provide necessary support for small coal mines. In particular, many township coal mines are eager for wealth and seek quick profits, mining wherever there is coal. Many exposed coal seams and easily mined coal have been largely exhausted. Now, it is necessary to move towards deeper mining, which is more challenging. Without necessary investment and technological upgrades, these mines will struggle to continue. According to relevant departments, investment in the construction of local state-owned coal mines has been decreasing year by year, leading to a continuous decline in production. The annual production growth of township coal mines in the first two years of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" dropped from over 50 million tons in the last two years of the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" to 21 million tons. This trend should be of concern to relevant departments.

Supporting small coal mines requires not only state funding but also, more importantly, local efforts. Localities should establish coal mine development funds to increase maintenance costs for basic production. The principle of "giving before taking" should be followed. Small coal mines should be guided to accumulate, upgrade, and develop themselves. Currently, some township coal mines do not prioritize accumulation, distributing all earnings immediately, which is a dangerous approach. The deeper the mining, the more necessary it is to invest. If a mine's upgrade funds are limited, it can follow the path of cooperation, upgrading one mine and then another, completing the process in batches and phases. Shanxi Province's Yangcheng County, Gaoping County, Henan's Pingdingshan City, and Yunnan's Shizong County have adopted the method of merging mines and deepening mining, reducing mining points, increasing production, and reducing accidents, achieving significant results.

Selecting a batch of counties with rich coal resources, convenient transportation, self-sufficient coal production, and development potential to build reliable, adjustable, and trustworthy commercial coal production bases is an important measure to guide the healthy development of small coal mines. Currently, this work has attracted the attention of relevant departments in various places, and the first batch of 100 key coal-producing counties is undergoing comprehensive planning and design, with 38 counties already starting exploratory work. After completing this work, small coal mines will transition from primitive and simple production to safe and standardized production, from shallow and scattered mining to deep and concentrated mining, and from single and extensive operations to intensive operations. The first batch of 100 counties can account for about 70% of the long-term planned production increase for local coal mines nationwide. Building key coal-producing areas is a comprehensive and systematic project that involves the entire county's economy and various departments, not something that can be accomplished by a single department. It requires a holistic approach and full effort.

State-owned allocated coal mines have relatively strong capabilities and should provide strong support to lawful small coal mines.

By the end of this century, if the national industrial and agricultural output value grows at an average rate of 6%, primary energy will require at least 1.47 billion tons of standard coal, of which more than half, or 700 million tons, will need to be produced by small coal mines. The task is arduous and must not be underestimated.

    引导小煤矿健康发展
    本报记者  刘燮阳
    现在，社会上对小煤矿责难颇多，一曰破坏资源严重，二曰事故多。这种简单否定的态度是不公正的。
    按所有制分，小煤矿可分为两大部分，一是地方国营煤矿，包括省（市、区）、地、县和各行业办的全民所有制煤矿；二是乡镇煤矿，包括乡村、城镇集资合作办的集体所有制以及个人投资和集资合股办的煤矿。
    这两部分煤矿，这些年来发展很快，目前，全国各地小煤矿有各类矿井８万多处，保有地质储量９８５亿吨，从业人员约３４０万人，年产量５．１亿吨以上，占全国煤炭总产量９．７亿吨的一半以上，其中地方国营小煤矿１．９亿吨，乡镇集体和个体煤矿３．２亿吨。
    小煤矿的兴起，对缓解能源紧张局面，满足人民生活需要，帮助农民脱贫致富，支援各地工农业生产，起着十分重要的作用。
    而且，小煤矿的增产是在没有花国家大量资金的情况下发展起来的。现在，建成一个国营大矿，至少需８年以上时间，投资几亿元；而建成一座年产五六万吨的小型矿，当年建成当年投产。依靠地方和个体办矿是一条投资省，见效快，解决能源困难的好办法。
    当然，也要看到，小煤矿先天不足，设备简陋，安全生产条件不好。许多小煤矿管理混乱，特别是对乡镇煤矿管理不严。一些地方没有统一的规划，缺乏必要的审批手续和技术论证，盲目开采，乱采滥掘。出现这种状况的一个重要原因是，有些同志把放宽政策同加强管理对立起来，放松了必要的管理工作，必须加强整顿。河北邯郸峰峰矿区，过去开办小煤矿比较混乱，乱采滥掘现象严重。１９８４、１９８５年两年间，大小矿井发生资源纠纷１５４起，经济损失３００万元。这两年经过当地政府和矿务局联合起来进行严格整顿。现在，采矿有序，管理有条，生产秩序井然，既保护了国家资源，又发展了煤炭生产。山东省实行统配煤矿、地方煤矿、乡镇煤矿统一归口，加强了行业管理。这些地方加强小煤矿管理的经验，值得各地借鉴。
    我国绝大多数小煤矿是仓促上阵，因陋就简发展起来的，矿井建设先天不足，对小煤矿进行必要的扶持是当务之急。尤其是一些乡镇煤矿求富心切，急功近利，哪里有煤，哪里采，许多露头煤，好采的煤采得差不多了，现在，需要向深部发展，难度就大了，对此，不进行必要的投入，不进行必要的技术改造，这些矿就很难再维持下去了。据有关部门统计，这些年来，对地方国营煤矿基建投资逐年减少，产量连续下降，乡镇煤矿“七五”头两年年产量增长由“六五”后两年的５０００多万吨下降到２１００万吨。这种势头，应当引起有关部门的重视。
    对小煤矿进行扶持，固然需要国家拿出一定的资金，但更主要的是需要依靠地方的力量。各地要建立地方煤矿发展基金，提高维持简单生产费用。如要“取”之，必须先“予”之。要引导小煤矿进行自我积累，自我改造，自我发展。现在，有些乡镇煤矿很不重视积累，赚了钱就分光吃净，这种杀鸡取蛋的办法，是十分危险的。越是往深部开采，越是要进行必要的投入，一个矿改造的资金有限，可以走联合的道路，改造一个，再改造另一个，分批分期完成。山西省阳城县、高平县、河南平顶山市、云南师宗县就是采用合并办矿，延深开采的方法，矿点减少，产量增多，事故下降，收到了明显效果。
    挑选一批煤炭资源丰富，运销方便，产煤自给自余，具有发展前途的县，建设成为靠得住、调得出、信得过的商品煤生产基地，是引导小煤矿健康发展的一项重要措施。目前，这项工作已引起各地有关部门的重视，第一批１００个重点产煤县正在进行总体规划设计，其中３８个县已在探索中开始起步。这项工作完成后，小煤矿将由土法简易生产，转向安全正规生产，由浅部分散开采，转向深部集中开采，由单一粗放经营，转向集约经营，第一批１００个县可以担负全国地方煤矿长期规划增长产量的７０％左右。建设重点产煤是关系到全县经济各行各业，各部门的一项综合的系统工程，不是哪一个部门能单独办到的事，需要有一盘棋的精神，全力抓好。
    国营统配煤矿具有比较雄厚的实力，对那些合法的小煤矿，大力加以支持。
    到本世纪末，全国工农业总产值如按平均增长６％的速度预测，一次能源最少需１４．７亿吨标准煤，其中７亿多吨，也就是一半多的产量要靠小煤矿完成，任务十分艰巨，万万不可轻视。
