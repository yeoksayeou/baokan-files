Capital university students and teachers welcome Zhao Ziyang's speech
Hoping the Party and government will strengthen democratic and legal construction and increase transparency

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Tonight at 7 p.m., Central China Television broadcast Zhao Ziyang's speech to guests attending the Asian Development Bank annual meeting, which sparked widespread reactions in universities in the capital. Our reporter visited several universities, including Peking University and Tsinghua University, and talked to some teachers and students, hearing many sincere opinions.

At around 10 p.m., in the campus of the China University of Political Science and Law, students were listening to Zhao Ziyang's speech on the radio and discussing it. After the speech ended, they applauded. A student from the class of 1986 in the Department of Economic Law said, "Zhao Ziyang's speech is relatively objective and practical. I agree with his eight words: calm, rational, restrained, and orderly. This is indeed what we need now. Solving problems on the track of democracy and the rule of law is the wisest way." Another student added, "We sincerely hope that the Party and government will truly strengthen democratic and legal construction, act according to law, and increase transparency."

When Peking University broadcast Zhao Ziyang's speech, thousands of people gathered to listen. A young teacher of economics told the reporter, "This is a moderate speech, showing the Party and government's sincerity, which will play a positive role in solving current problems." A student who was active in the parade said, "We welcome this attitude of handling problems, but the key is to see how the dialogue will proceed next and what practical problems can be solved."

In the dormitory of China Renmin University, several graduate students chatted with the reporter. They had just returned from the parade and had learned the content of Zhao Ziyang's speech, thinking it was good. One student said, "Leaders and students both need to be rational. Zhao's speech is very rational." A graduate student from the Department of Statistics proposed, "Let us reflect problems through normal channels, but first, we need to ensure that the normal channels are truly unobstructed, otherwise, how can we reflect?"

The reporter saw a calm Tsinghua University tonight. Students who participated in the parade had returned to school, and four teaching buildings were brightly lit. Many students were reviewing their lessons. A student from the class of 1987 in the Department of Automotive Engineering said, "We can accept Zhao Ziyang's speech. Students' patriotic enthusiasm needs to be understood. On April 27, we walked for 17 and a half hours, and it was the first time in my life that I walked so far. Why did we do it? Today, I did not go to the parade. I think the parade is not the fundamental way to solve problems." Some students who had just finished watching a video commemorating May 4th told the reporter, "Stopping classes but not stopping learning actually affects our studies. Now everyone needs to calm down and can study while dialoguing. In short, it is time to return to classes."

At Beijing Normal University, President Wang Ziqun, who had just come out of the student dormitory, told the reporter, "Zhao's speech is relatively comprehensive, affirming the achievements of reform and construction over the past 10 years and pointing out the serious problems that exist, such as corruption. Students' actions reflect the dissatisfaction of a considerable number of people with the phenomenon of corruption. Just now, I went to the students' dormitory to visit the students, and I proposed two hopes to them: first, I hope everyone will watch Zhao's speech carefully tomorrow and think about it; second, I hope students will return to classes as soon as possible."

The reporter learned that some university teachers and students hold reservations about certain contents of Zhao Ziyang's speech.

　　首都高校师生欢迎赵紫阳讲话    
    希望党和政府切实加强民主和法制建设增加透明度
    本报北京５月４日讯  今晚７时，中央电视台播出赵紫阳会见出席亚行年会客人时的讲话，在首都高校引起广泛反响。本报记者前往北大、清华等几所学校，同一些师生交谈，听到他们不少由衷的意见。
    当晚１０时许，中国政法大学校园里，正在广播赵紫阳讲话，同学们边听边议论，讲话播完，响起一片掌声。经济法学系８６级的一位学生说：“赵紫阳讲话比较客观，比较实际，我同意他说的八个字：冷静、理智、克制、秩序。这的确是目前我们必需的。在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题是最明智的办法。”另一位同学补充说：“我们真诚地希望党和政府能切实加强民主和法制建设，依法办事，增加透明度。”
    北京大学在广播赵紫阳讲话时，上千人围在一处听。一位教经济的青年教师对记者说：“这是一个温和的讲话，表明党和政府的诚意，会对解决目前的问题起积极作用。”一位在游行中比较活跃的同学说：“我们欢迎这种处理问题的态度，但关键还要看下一步如何对话，能解决什么实际问题。”
    在中国人民大学学生宿舍学２楼里，几位研究生与记者攀谈起来，他们刚参加游行归来，已得知紫阳讲话内容，认为讲得不错。一位同学说：“领导人和学生都需要理智，紫阳这个讲话就很理智。”计统系一位研究生提出：“让我们用正常渠道反映问题，但首先要保证正常渠道真正畅通，否则我们如何反映？”
    记者今晚看到的清华园是平静的。参加游行的学生已经返校，４个教学楼灯火通明，不少学生正在温习功课。汽车系８７级一位同学说：“赵紫阳的讲话，我们能接受。学生们的爱国热情需要理解。４月２７日那天我们走了１７个半小时，我有生以来还是第一次走这么远的路。我们为了什么？今天游行我没有去，我觉得游行不是解决问题的根本办法。”刚从电教室看完纪念“五四”录像的一些同学对记者说，“罢课不罢学”实际上对学业还是有影响的。现在大家都需要冷静，可以边上课边对话。总之，是复课的时候了。
    在北京师范大学，刚刚从学生宿舍出来的王梓坤校长对记者说：“紫阳的讲话比较全面，既肯定了１０年来改革和建设的成绩，也指出了存在的严重问题，比如贪污腐败现象。学生的行动反映了相当一部分群众对腐败现象的不满。刚才我去学生宿舍看望同学们，我对他们提出两点希望：第一，希望大家明天好好看看紫阳的讲话，好好想想；第二，希望同学们早日复课。”
    记者了解到，也有一些高校师生对赵紫阳讲话的某些内容，持保留态度。
