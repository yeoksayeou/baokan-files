Regarding Issues Related to the Execution of Martial Law Tasks
Martial Law Command Spokesperson Answers Journalists' Questions

The martial law command spokesperson today answered journalists' questions regarding issues related to the execution of martial law tasks.

Q: Currently, some residents in Beijing have doubts about martial law. What is your view on this?

A: Implementing martial law in some areas of Beijing is an unavoidable measure taken due to the chaotic social order in Beijing. Some citizens and young students have doubts about martial law, which is due to a lack of understanding of martial law, as well as the spread of rumors and incitement by a very small number of people with ulterior motives. The People's Liberation Army is an army nurtured by the people and serves the people wholeheartedly. This time, executing martial law tasks is entirely for the benefit of the people, to restore the production, work, life, and teaching order in the capital. Some people say, "Martial law is suppressing the masses," which is a complete misunderstanding. Recently, there have been continuous rumors that the military will "suppress students at Tiananmen Square." Now it is clear that this is completely a rumor.

Q: Maintaining social order has public security police and armed police. Is it appropriate to deploy the military?

A: Article 29 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China states: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Their mission is to consolidate national defense, resist aggression, defend the motherland, defend the peaceful labor of the people, participate in national construction, and strive to serve the people." Article 89 also states: The State Council has the power to "decide on martial law in part of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government." The vast majority of citizens and young students do not want the chaotic situation in Beijing to continue. Some troops entering Beijing to assist in maintaining social order are precisely to ensure the normal life of Beijing citizens. From this, it can be seen that the People's Liberation Army, under orders, executes martial law tasks completely legally and in line with current actual needs.

Q: How is the situation of the troops executing martial law tasks currently?

A: Currently, the troops executing martial law tasks are conducting education on loving the capital, loving the people of the capital, and loving young students, as well as policy and discipline education. Their morale is high, and discipline is strict. The relationship between the martial law troops and Beijing citizens and young students is harmonious. The broad masses of citizens and young students have given the troops great support and help, for which the troops are grateful. The interests and wishes of the martial law troops and the broad masses of Beijing citizens and young students are completely consistent. However, due to some people's lack of understanding or misinformation, as well as the incitement of a very small number of people with ulterior motives, some troops have been obstructed during their advance and even verbally abused and beaten by some people. Some soldiers have been injured by lawbreakers, with some injuries being severe and requiring hospitalization. Even in such circumstances, the martial law troops, for the benefit of the people, have adopted a highly restrained and tolerant attitude. We believe that some citizens and young students who temporarily do not understand or are misinformed will gradually eliminate their misunderstandings and concerns through practice and will work together with the martial law troops to expose the rumor-mongering and sabotage activities of a very small number of people with ulterior motives. We believe that with the active cooperation and support of the broad masses of citizens and young students, the martial law troops will be able to work together with public security police and armed police to complete the martial law tasks and restore the normal order of the capital as soon as possible.

　　就执行戒严任务的有关问题
    戒严部队指挥部发言人答记者问
    新华社北京５月２３日电  戒严部队指挥部发言人今天就执行戒严任务的有关问题回答了记者的提问。
    问：当前北京有些群众对戒严有疑虑，你对此有何看法？
    答：在北京部分地区实行戒严，是根据北京目前社会秩序的混乱状况，迫不得已采取的措施。有些市民、青年学生对戒严产生某些疑虑，是由于对戒严不理解，加上极少数别有用心的人造谣、挑拨引起的。人民解放军是人民养育的军队，是全心全意为人民服务的，这次执行戒严任务，完全是为了保护人民利益，恢复首都生产、工作、生活、教学秩序。有人说“戒严就是镇压群众”，这完全是误解。近来不断有人谣传部队要“镇压天安门广场的大学生”，现在已经很清楚了，这完全是造谣。
    问：维护社会治安有公安干警和武警，动用军队是否合适？
    答：我国《宪法》第２９条规定：“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民。它的任务是巩固国防，抵抗侵略，保卫祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动，参加国家建设事业，努力为人民服务。”第８９条还规定：国务院有权“决定省、自治区、直辖市的范围内部分地区的戒严”。广大市民和青年学生都不愿意看到北京市的混乱状况再继续下去。部分部队进北京市协助维护社会治安，正是为了保障北京市人民的正常生活。由此可见，人民解放军奉命执行戒严任务是完全合法的，也是完全合乎当前实际需要的。
    问：当前，执行戒严任务的部队情况怎么样？
    答：目前，执行戒严任务的部队正在进行热爱首都、热爱首都人民、热爱青年学生的教育和政策纪律教育，情绪饱满，纪律严明。戒严部队官兵同北京市民、青年学生的关系是融洽的。广大市民和青年学生给部队很大的支持和帮助，部队官兵对此是感激的。戒严部队官兵和北京市广大市民、青年学生的利益与愿望是完全一致的。但是，目前由于有些人不理解或不明真相，加上极少数别有用心的人的挑动，使有的部队在开进中受到阻拦，甚至遭到某些人的辱骂和殴打。有些官兵被不法分子打伤，有的伤势较重，被送进医院。即使在这种情况下，戒严部队官兵为了人民的利益，采取极大克制、忍耐的态度。我们相信，一些暂时不理解或不明真相的市民和青年学生通过实践会逐步消除误解、解除顾虑，会同戒严部队官兵一起揭露极少数别有用心的人的造谣、破坏活动。我们相信，在广大市民、青年学生的积极配合、支持下，戒严部队官兵一定能协同公安干警、武警部队完成戒严任务，尽快恢复首都的正常秩序。
