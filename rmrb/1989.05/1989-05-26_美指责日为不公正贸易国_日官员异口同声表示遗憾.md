People's Daily, Tokyo, May 26th. Reporter Yu Qing reports: The United States Trade Representative, Clayton Yeutter, today (May 25th U.S. time) issued a statement. According to Section 301 of the U.S. Trade Act, Japan has been designated as a country engaging in unfair trade practices. The U.S. has decided to investigate Japan in three areas: supercomputers, artificial satellites, and wood products. If no agreement is reached within one or one and a half years, the U.S. will impose retaliatory tariffs on these three imported items, and U.S.-Japan economic relations will once again face tension.

After the news reached Japan, Japanese government officials, including Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru, Foreign Minister Uno Sōsuke, and Minister of International Trade and Industry Mitsuzuka Hiroshi, all expressed regret in their speeches.

Foreign Minister Uno today summoned the U.S. Ambassador to Japan and said he deeply regretted the U.S. decision. Japan's efforts to open its market have not been recognized, and the U.S. also has significant import barriers, which the Japanese people find unfair. The U.S. decision is unilateral and unfair.

Minister of International Trade and Industry Mitsuzuka, when meeting with reporters, said that the U.S. unilateral decision is unfair. Japan does not intend to negotiate bilaterally with the U.S. and has decided to submit the issue to GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) negotiations to resolve it. This is to avoid the escalation of U.S.-Japan trade friction into a state of war.

　　美指责日为不公正贸易国
    日官员异口同声表示遗憾
    本报东京５月２６日电  记者于青报道：美国贸易代表处代表希尔斯今天上午（美国时间２５日下午）发表声明，根据美国综合贸易法案第３０１条，确定日本为不公正贸易国，决定在巨型计算机、人造卫星和木材制品３个项目上，对日本进行调查。如果１年或１年半内达不成妥协，美国将对上述３项进口产品课以报复性关税，日美经济关系再度面临紧张。
    美国的消息传到日本后，日本政府官员首相竹下登、外相宇野宗佑、通产相三塚博等政府官员在讲话中异口同声表示遗憾。
    宇野外相今天在外务省召见美国驻日本大使时说，对美国的决定深表遗憾。日本开放市场的努力没有得到评价，美国方面也有相当多的进口壁垒，对此日本国民感到不公正。美国单方面决定不公平。
    三塚通产相在会见记者时表示，美国单方面决定是不公平的。日本不打算与美国进行两国间谈判，决定提交关贸总协定谈判解决。避免日美贸易摩擦形成战争状态。
