The persistent leaking of water from flush toilets is a significant problem. The water tank in a flush toilet contains a ball valve about the size of a persimmon. If this valve does not seal properly, the toilet will continuously leak water. According to rough estimates, this results in a loss of over 300 million tons of water annually nationwide, equivalent to approximately 30 million yuan. This issue causes headaches for countless households.

Three years ago, veteran mechanical engineer Shen Hong called for a solution to the problem of leaking flush toilets. The State Planning Commission and other departments also issued a document stating that they aim to fundamentally resolve the issue of leaking flush toilets within three to five years.

In 1986, Engineer Lou Zangyuan from the Jiangsu Provincial Machinery Bureau designed a new type of anti-leak ball valve. This valve does not require any changes to the original water tank structure; it only needs to be replaced with a new one at a cost of about 1 yuan, which can fundamentally solve the problem of leaking flush toilets. After more than a hundred users tested the sample, it was found to be the most convenient, economical, and effective solution for addressing the issue of leaking flush toilets. Therefore, this invention was granted a national patent. In 1987, at the patent and technology trade fair held in Shanghai, the anti-leak ball valve attracted great interest. Soon after, the Leyu Rubber and Plastic Products Factory in Zhangjiagang began trial production of the flush toilet anti-leak ball valve. After more than a hundred tests, the anti-leak ball valve was finally successful in September 1988. The product, after being used by more than a thousand households and evaluated by experts, was found to have excellent results, with a 100% sealing rate and technical quality fully meeting the design requirements. Managers from the Shanghai Daxia Bin Hotel and Wukang Hotel personally conducted tests with the anti-leak ball valve, opening and closing it more than a hundred times without any leaks, and immediately replaced all the old ball valves. Units such as the Jiangsu Provincial Machinery Bureau and the Provincial International Trust and Investment Corporation also gave high praise after using the product. In just three to four months, Factory Director Zhu Jianping of the Leyu Rubber and Plastic Products Factory received more than 300 letters of praise and thanks.

However, good things often come with difficulties. After the product entered mass production, it encountered numerous obstacles in sales. Relevant personnel first attempted to sell the product in Nanjing and Shanghai, visiting dozens of plumbing, sanitation, and hardware stores, but found very few willing to distribute it. Some complained that the new ball valve had low profit margins and was not worth selling; others felt that the new ball valve had low brand recognition and would be difficult to sell; still, others hinted that there was no kickback or the kickback was too small, so they were not interested in selling it. Later, a sanitation equipment store in Shanghai agreed to act as an agent, but after purchasing the product in September 1988, by December 6, the new product had still not been put on the shelves. The store said they would wait until the old products in the warehouse were sold out before selling the new product. However, they had tens of thousands of old products in stock, and who knows when they would be sold out!

The factory also attempted to sell the product to some sanitary ware production enterprises and construction units, but the response was similarly cold. A supply clerk from a sanitary ware factory in Nanjing frankly said, "Our factory needs 15,000 ball valves per month, but they are all supplied by cooperative units. They have supported us in the past, and today we cannot abandon them." From September 1988 to the end of December, relevant personnel from this factory visited more than a hundred sanitary ware distribution units and supporting factories, spending nearly 200,000 yuan on sales expenses, but only sold fewer than 10,000 ball valves, while the factory produces more than 40,000 ball valves per month. Currently, the factory has a backlog of products, and funds cannot be turned over, putting the enterprise on the brink of collapse.

China's water resources are insufficient, and there are water shortages everywhere. However, new technologies and products that save water for the country and save money for users are accumulating in large quantities. This situation is truly regrettable.

### 马桶长流水令人头痛  防漏新产品却难推销

    马桶长流水令人头痛
    防漏新产品却难推销
    抽水马桶的水箱里有一个柿子大小的球塞，如球塞堵塞不严，马桶便漏水不止。据有人粗略估算，每年全国因此损失3亿多吨水，约合人民币3000万元。成千上万家用户也为此感到头痛。
    3年前，我国机械老专家沈鸿曾呼吁解决抽水马桶漏水问题。国家计委等部门也曾发文，说争取在三五年内能从根本上解决抽水马桶漏水问题。
    1986年，江苏省机械厅工程师楼樟园设计了一种新型防漏球塞。这种球塞不需要改变原水箱的结构，只需花费1元钱左右，自己动手更换一个，就可以从根本上解决抽水马桶漏水问题。他试制的样品，经上百家用户使用后表明：是解决抽水马桶漏水最为简便、经济、有效的办法。因此，他的这项发明获得了国家的专利。1987年，在上海举行的专利技术交易会上，防漏球塞引起人们的极大兴趣。不久，张家港市乐余橡塑制品厂开始试制抽水马桶防漏球塞。通过上百次试验，防漏球塞终于在1988年9月获得了成功。产品经上千家用户使用和专家鉴定，认为效果颇佳，堵漏率达100％，技术质量完全达到了设计要求。上海达华宾馆、武康旅社等单位的经理，亲自拿防漏球塞作试验，开启100多次，无一漏水，当即全部换上了新球塞。江苏省机械厅、省国际信托投资公司等单位使用后，也称赞不绝。在短短的三四个月里，乐余橡塑制品厂支建平厂长收到的表扬信、感谢信达300多封。
    然而，好事多磨。当产品投入批量生产后，销售上却屡屡受阻。有关人员先是在南京、上海一带推销，走访了几十家水暖、卫生、五金器材商店，结果愿意经销者寥寥无几。有的嫌新型球塞利润薄不愿销；有的嫌新型球塞知名度小，不好销；有的则暗示没有回扣或回扣少了不想销，等等。后来，上海有家卫生器材商店答应代销，但1988年9月进货后，到12月6日厂方派人去看时，新产品仍未上柜。店方说，要等仓库的老产品销完后，才能销售新产品。而他们库存的老产品数以万计，何时才能售完！
    厂里向一些洁具生产企业和施工建筑单位推销，反映同样冷淡。南京一家洁具生产厂的供销员坦率地说：“我们厂每月需要1.5万只球塞，但都是协作单位供给的。人家过去支持过我们，今天我们也不能过河拆桥。”1988年9月至12月底，这家厂有关人员走访了上百家卫生洁具经销单位和配套厂家，花去了近2万元的销售费用，销出的球塞竟不到1万只，而这家厂月生产4万多只。目前，厂里产品积压，资金无法周转，企业濒临绝境。
    我国的水资源不足，到处都在叫缺水。可是，为国家节水，为用户节支的新技术、新产品却大量积压，这种情况实在令人遗憾。
