The epic "Perilous Kunlun," produced by the August First Film Studio over three years and with an investment of over 20 million yuan, has been completed and will premiere on July 1st. The film has also been selected for the first China Film Festival to be held in September this year. This was announced at a press conference held recently by the studio.

The film combines grand scenes with vivid details to recreate the historical events of 1947, when the Communist Party of China, led by Mao Zedong, strategically withdrew from Yan'an to avoid the Nationalist Army's offensive. The film vividly depicts the battles of Qinglianggang, Yangmahe, Panlong, and Shajiadian, showcasing the intelligence and bravery of both sides' highest command. It also highlights the charisma of Communist leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi. The film uniquely portrays the disagreements among the leaders, a rare depiction in previous artistic works.

During the filming of "Perilous Kunlun," Hu Yaobang showed personal concern and support. The film was scripted by Dong Sheng, directed by He Guang, co-directed by Jing Muqian, and photographed by Wei Tao. The roles of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, and Chiang Kai-shek are played by Zhang Keyao, Su Lin, Lu Xi, and Sun Feihu, respectively. Other notable figures in the film include Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Chen Yi, He Long, Chen Gong, and Wang Zhen from the Communist side, and Hu Zongnan, Bai Chongxi, Gu Zutong, and Song Meiling from the Nationalist side. Additionally, the film features Anna Louise Strong and John Leighton Stuart.

　　历史画卷雄伟壮阔　战争凯歌激奋高昂
    巨片《巍巍昆仑》七一公映
    本报北京讯  八一电影制片厂费时三年，耗资二千余万元拍摄的巨片《巍巍昆仑》已经完成，将从７月１日开始与观众见面，并入选将于今年９月举行的首届中国电影节。这是该厂在日前举行的记者招待会上宣布的。
    这部影片以壮阔的场面与生动的细节相结合，再现了１９４７年面对国民党军队的重点进攻，以毛泽东同志为首的中共中央主动撤离延安，率领昆仑纵队转战陕北的史实。影片在重点展示青化砭、羊马河、蟠龙、沙家店战役胜利的同时，表现了国共双方最高统帅部的斗智斗勇，浓墨重彩地描绘了中共领袖人物毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时等的神采。影片对领袖人物中的意见分歧的描写，在以前的文艺作品中是罕见的。
    《巍巍昆仑》在拍摄过程中，曾得到胡耀邦同志的亲切关注。该片由东生编剧，总导演郝光，导演景慕逵，总摄影魏铎。影片中的毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时、蒋介石分别由张克瑶、苏林、路希、孙飞虎饰演。片中出现的我党我军领导人还有刘少奇、朱德、彭德怀、刘伯承、邓小平、陈毅、贺龙、陈赓、王震等，国民党方面有胡宗南、白崇禧、顾祝同、宋美龄等，此外还有安娜·路易斯·斯特朗和司徒雷登。
