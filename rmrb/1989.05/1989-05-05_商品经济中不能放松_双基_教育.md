Some people have suggested that the previous emphasis on ensuring students acquire basic knowledge and skills should be changed to meet the needs of a commodity economy by teaching students knowledge that is "interesting" and directly related to job-seeking and earning a living. This not only involves reforming textbooks but also the understanding of the function of education.

It is undeniable that only by removing outdated, backward, repetitive, and impractical content and adding knowledge that reflects new scientific and technological achievements and is closely linked to reality, can our education become vibrant and adapt to the times. However, this does not mean that the teaching of basic knowledge can be weakened.

At the beginning of this century, under the influence of a commodity economy, the United States experienced a trend of abandoning traditional textbook teaching and encouraging students to participate in more practical activities, following the modernist educational theory of "learning by doing." After that, the United States saw a surge of "progressive" education movements. In "progressive schools," there were not only factories and farms but also stores, post offices, and banks as places for students to learn. Students learned the most practical social knowledge in these "classrooms." Because basic knowledge was completely ignored, the quality of American education declined significantly. The negative impact of pragmatism on American education is profound, and even today, Americans admit: "In science and mathematics, American students are near the bottom in the world."

Since the 1950s, every educational reform movement in the United States has consistently emphasized strengthening basic education. On February 23 of this year, some American scientific organizations announced a massive educational reform plan, which still aims to emphasize improving American students' basic education in science and mathematics.

The United States is a capitalist country with a decentralized education management system. Students enter the labor market directly after graduation, and education is greatly influenced by the commodity economy. However, they have not regarded educational content as merely a barometer of employment needs governed by market laws. Instead, they have planned the reform of textbooks and curricula from the perspective of future international competition and national strategic interests, especially emphasizing the learning of basic knowledge. Our country practices a planned commodity economy and should even less limit education to the level of cultivating livelihood skills, but should have more far-reaching goals.

Unfortunately, in recent years, some articles have one-sidedly criticized basic knowledge and basic skills as being useless, saying that they only serve the purpose of promoting higher education, advocating for vocational education to replace general education. This recognition, which only focuses on short-term effects and immediate interests and lacks a grand vision, easily leads to the conclusion that "double-based" education is useless.

Primary and secondary education, by its nature, is general education. Its task is to lay a foundation in ideology, morality, science, and culture for higher education or vocational education, and to promote the all-round development of students, rather than requiring them to directly serve production and construction. It is even more inappropriate to not lay a solid foundation in science and culture just because students may not go to college in the future. Otherwise, it will change the nature of general education and cause confusion in theory and practice.

It should also be pointed out that recognizing that education is subject to economic laws is correct. However, market value laws are not the only laws that determine the direction of education development. The all-round development of human beings is the ultimate goal of education. The teaching of basic knowledge not only lays a solid foundation for students in terms of knowledge and skills but also has the function of training intellectual thinking, making it easier to learn by analogy in future studies and benefiting them for life.

China's commodity economy is not yet developed, and the labor market is not fully developed. Therefore, some market signals such as "a scalpel is not as good as a razor" are actually temporary and distorted interference and do not reflect the true value law. Education is a long-term undertaking with a long cycle and lag, subject to the inherent laws of education itself. Therefore, the reform of teaching content should reflect the characteristics of the times but should not be influenced by such false interference signals.

### 商品经济中不能放松“双基”教育

　　商品经济中不能放松“双基”教育
    北京师范大学教育系袁小华
    有人提出，过去提倡的使学生获得基础知识和基本技能的作法，应该改为适应商品经济发展的需要，教给学生“感兴趣的”、与求职谋生直接相关的知识。这就不仅仅涉及教材的改革，而且涉及对教育功能的认识问题。
    不可否认，只有剔除那些陈旧、落后、重复和脱离实际的内容，增加反映科技新成果和与实际联系紧密的知识，才能使我国教育焕发活力，适应时代的发展。但这绝不意味着可以削弱基础知识的教学。
    本世纪初，在商品经济影响下，美国曾出现放弃传统的书本教学、让学生多参加实践活动，在“做中学”的现代派教育理论。那以后，美国出现了风起云涌的“进步主义”教育运动。在“进步学校”中，不但有工厂农场，还有商店、邮局、银行作为学生学习的场所，学生就在这些“课堂”里，学习社会最实用的知识。由于完全忽视基础知识的学习，造成了美国教育质量的大幅下降。实用主义给美国教育带来的消极影响十分深远，直至今天，美国人仍承认：“在理科和数学方面，美国学生在世界上排列的位置接近于最底层。”
    自５０年代以来，美国历次教育改革运动始终没有放弃加强基础教育这一宗旨。今年２月２３日，美国一些科学组织宣布的庞大教育改革计划，仍然以强调改革美国学生的理科和数学基础教育为目的。
    美国是实行分权制教育管理的资本主义国家，学生毕业后，直接进入劳动力市场，教育受商品经济的影响不可谓不大，但他们并没有把教育内容看作是只受市场规律支配的就业需要的晴雨表，而是从未来国际竞争、国家战略利益出发，全面规划教材和课程的改革，特别重视基础知识的学习。我国实行的是有计划的商品经济，就更不应该只把教育单纯限制于培养谋生本领这一层次，而应有更为长远的目标。
    遗憾的是，近年来一些文章片面指责基础知识和基本技能派不上用场，说这只是为升学教育服务的，主张以职业教育代替普通教育。这种只注重短期效应和眼前利益，缺乏远大目标的认识，很容易得出“双基”教育无用的结论。
    初、中等教育就其性质而言，是普通教育，任务是为高等教育或职业教育打好思想品德科学文化各方面的基础，使学生身心得到全面的发展，而不应要求其直接为生产建设服务，更不能因为将来学生不一定上大学就不打好科学文化基础。否则，就会改变普通教育的性质，造成理论和实践上的混乱。
    还应指出，认识到教育要受到经济法则制约是正确的。但是，市场价值规律并不是决定教育发展方向的唯一规律，人的全面发展才是教育的最终目标。基础知识的教学，不但能在知识和能力方面给学生打下牢靠的基础，而且具有训练智力思维的作用，使在今后的学习中易于触类旁通，终身受用。
    我国的商品经济还不发达，劳动力市场并未充分发育，因此市场传达的某些信号如“手术刀不如剃头刀”等等，实际是一种暂时的、失真的干扰，并未反映真实的价值规律。而教育是一项长远的事业，周期长、有滞后性，受教育本身内在规律的制约。因而，教学内容的改革既要反映时代的特色，又不能受这种虚假干扰信号的左右。
