People's Daily, Hefei, April 30th - Reporter Zhang Zhen Guo reports: The issues of "poor, late, and excessive" textbooks in Anhui's primary and secondary schools were exposed in a series of reports by People's Daily in March. The Anhui Provincial Government has taken these issues very seriously.

To ensure that textbooks for the upcoming autumn semester are delivered "before classes start," the Anhui Provincial Government has recently implemented five emergency measures: the allocation of paper for textbooks will be mandated by the provincial planning commission, with paper mills guaranteeing timely supply; the financial shortfall for paper will be subsidized by the provincial finance department with 350 million yuan, with an additional 250 million yuan in advance payments, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China will provide a loan of 700 million yuan; the quality of printing will be overseen by the provincial press and publication bureau, ensuring timely delivery of high-quality textbooks; during the textbook ordering and distribution process, no department or unit is allowed to forcefully bundle additional reference books or materials; for the issues of some textbooks not being delivered "before classes start" this spring and printing quality problems, the provincial government office will lead a thorough investigation involving relevant departments.

    安徽抓“课前到书”
    本报合肥４月３０日电  记者张振国报道：安徽中小学教材存在的“差、迟、滥”问题，本报于３月间作了连续披露。安徽省府对此十分重视。
    为确保今秋中小学教材做到“课前到书”，安徽省府最近采取５项紧急措施：课本用纸，由省计委作指令性计划下达，各造纸厂保证及时供应；用纸所缺资金，由省财政补贴３５０万元、垫付２５０万元，省工商银行贷款７００万元；印制质量由省新闻出版局负责，按质按时供应；在课本征订和发行中，任何部门和单位都不准硬性搭配参考书籍和资料；对今春部分课本未能“课前到书”及印制质量等问题，由省府办公厅牵头，组织有关部门认真调查。
