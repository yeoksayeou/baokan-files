Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, May 14th.

	In response to India's trade blockade against Nepal, the Nepalese government today announced a new 22-point policy aimed at achieving self-sufficiency.

	The new policy focuses on accelerating the domestic production of daily necessities and industrial raw materials.

	Given that Nepal previously exported fruits and vegetables to India during the peak season and imported them from India during the off-season, the new policy will encourage private enterprises to establish cold storage facilities to store domestically produced fruits and vegetables.

	The government will simplify import procedures to encourage private entities to import urgently needed raw materials and components from countries other than India. At the same time, the government will promote small-scale industries and agricultural production.

	The new policy stipulates that in the budget for the next fiscal year, starting July 16, the government will prioritize the development of electricity, alternative energy, irrigation, and road construction projects.

	Government agencies will reduce administrative expenses, stop purchasing furniture and cars, halt the construction of office buildings, and cut down on overseas visits and entertainment expenses.

　　对付印度贸易封锁    
    尼颁布自给自足政策
    新华社加德满都五月十四日电  面对印度对尼泊尔实行的贸易封锁，尼泊尔政府今天公布了一项旨在实现自给自足的二十二点新政策。
    新政策重点在于加速国内日用必需品和工业原材料的生产。
    鉴于过去尼泊尔的水果和蔬菜，在旺季往印度出口，而到淡季又从印度进口，新政策将鼓励私营企业建立冷藏库，以储存自产水果和蔬菜。
    政府将简化进口程序，以鼓励私人从印度以外的第三国进口急需的原材料和零部件。同时，政府将鼓励小手工业和小农生产。
    新政策规定，在从七月十六日开始的下一财政年度预算中，政府将优先考虑发展电力、替代能源、水利灌溉、公路建设等项目。
    政府机关将削减行政开支，停止购买家具、汽车，停建办公楼房并将压缩出国访问和招待费用。
