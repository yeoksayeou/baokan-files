This year, China's total fixed asset investment plan is 330 billion yuan, a reduction of 23.74% from last year's actual completion of 432.7 billion yuan. Of this, the reduction in state-owned infrastructure and technical transformation projects is 23.93%. The annual investment assessment indicators and compression tasks for the entire country have been broken down and, at the beginning of last month, were issued as mandatory indicators to various provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and relevant central departments. Now, people are generally concerned about whether these investment plan indicators and compression tasks will be implemented? Will the scale of construction expand again?

Implementing the plan assessment indicators and completing the task of compressing the investment scale are directly related to the smooth implementation of the correct policies for rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening comprehensive reforms. To carry out rectification and rectification, the Party and the state have taken about 20 major measures, among which the key is to resolutely compress the scale of fixed asset investment. If the state's investment plan is not implemented and the compression task is not completed, it will drive up money supply, leading to price increases. This would mean that an important link in rectification and rectification is tending to fail, bringing disappointment to the people. This is not just an economic issue, but also a political issue.

To implement the plan and compress the scale, we must first acknowledge and face the plan. The Wuxi Municipal Government disregards the law, ignores orders, and prohibits violations, disregarding the state plan and arbitrarily approving a large number of new projects. This is extremely harmful to the implementation of the policies of rectification and rectification and deepening reforms. One of the prominent features of developing a socialist commodity economy in our country is that the economy must operate on the track of the state plan at the macro level. Ignoring or even denying the role of the plan, not acknowledging or executing the state plan, is itself a reflection of disordered economic thinking. Since the founding of the country, the severe lessons of multiple macroeconomic controls have all been related to unrestrained investment in various aspects, which has made us suffer a lot.

Compressing the oversized investment scale is the key to rectification and rectification; implementing the state plan investment indicators is the key to compressing the investment scale. Effectively implementing the plan assessment indicators is not only an expression of acknowledging and executing the state plan, but also an effective means of completing the compression task. So far, many regions still have a large number of ongoing projects that are intentionally placed outside the plan, not handled as stopped or slowed down, waiting for the opportunity to resume. This not only affects the completion of the compression task, but also harbors the potential for the scale of construction to expand again. Only by following the industrial policy, based on urgent needs and actual possibilities, can we prioritize and implement the plan indicators, and then treat all projects outside the plan as stopped or slowed down, can we truly compress the investment scale.

Implementing the plan indicators is essentially about drawing a clear line between which projects can be done and which cannot. Of course, implementing the plan indicators is a fairly complex issue. There are issues of understanding, interests, and practical problems, and it is quite an art to handle them. However, as long as we seriously follow the state's policies, laws, and regulations, and act in accordance with the will of the people, each place will be able to create some valuable and effective experiences.

The state plan indicators cannot be exceeded, and the compression task must be completed resolutely. This is the objective requirement of the current economic situation, the urgent requirement of national macro-control, and also the general wish of the broad masses of the people. In the first four months of this year, China's economic situation has been relatively stable, which is the result of the initial effectiveness of various rectification and rectification measures. However, we must also see the many potential problems that lie beneath the surface, and the economic situation remains quite severe. Taking prices as an example, the previous period was controlled by administrative means and fiscal subsidies to curb the upward trend, but if we do not continue to do a good job of "removing the root cause," it will not be sustainable. Therefore, we cannot be complacent because of the current stability and relax our efforts to compress the scale of social demand, especially investment demand.

　　落实投资计划　完成压缩任务
    本报评论员
    今年，我国全社会固定资产投资计划３３００亿元，比去年实际完成４３２７亿元压缩２３．７４％。其中，全民基建和技改压缩２３．９３％。全国全年投资考核指标与压缩任务经过分解，已在上月初曾以指令性指标分别下达给了各省（区、市）和中央有关部门。现在，人们普遍关注这个投资计划指标和压缩任务是否落实？建设规模会不会再度膨胀？
    落实计划考核指标，完成压缩投资规模任务，直接关系到治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革正确方针的顺利贯彻执行。为进行治理、整顿，党和国家采取了２０来项重大措施，其中关键性的便是坚决压缩固定资产投资规模。倘若国家下达的投资计划不落实，压缩规模任务完不成，那就会拉动货币投放，导致物价上涨。这将意味着治理、整顿的一个重要环节趋于失败，给人民带来失望。这不只是经济问题，也是政治问题。
    落实计划，压缩规模，先得承认计划，正视计划。无锡市政府有法不依，有令不行，有禁不止，无视国家计划，擅自批准新开工一大批项目，对贯彻治理整顿、深化改革的方针是极其有害的。在我国发展社会主义商品经济，显著特点之一就是在宏观上经济须在国家计划轨道上运行。无视甚至否定计划的作用，不承认、不执行国家计划，本身就是无秩序经济思想的反映。建国以来发生的多次宏观失控的严重教训，无不与不受约束地多方面任意投资有关，它使我们吃够了苦头。
    压缩过大的投资规模，是治理、整顿的关键；落实国家计划投资指标，则是压缩投资规模的关键。切实落实计划考核指标，既是承认和执行国家计划的表现，又是完成压缩规模任务的有效手段。迄今为止，许多地区仍有一大批在建项目被有意置于计划之外，未作停缓处理，伺机而上。这不仅影响压缩任务的完成，而且潜伏着建设规模再度膨胀的动因。只有按照产业政策，根据紧迫需要和实际可能，分别轻重缓急，落实计划指标，进而将计划“笼”外项目一律作为停缓处理，才能把投资规模真正压下来。
    落实计划指标，实质在于划清哪些项目能干、哪些项目不能干的界限。当然，落实计划指标是个相当复杂的问题。这里既有认识问题、利益问题，又有实际问题，处理起来颇有学问。但是，只要认真遵循国家政策、法令和人民的意愿办事，各地都将能够创造出一些行之有效的宝贵经验来。
    国家计划指标不能突破，压缩规模任务坚决完成。这是当前经济形势的客观需要，国家宏观调控的紧迫要求，也是广大人民的普遍愿望。今年头４个月，我国经济形势比较平稳，这是治理、整顿各项措施开始生效的结果。但是，还需看到潜伏着的不少问题，经济形势仍然相当严峻。以物价为例，前一段是用行政手段和财政补贴办法把增涨势头遏制下来的，如不继续做好“釜底抽薪”工作，那是不能持久的。因此，我们不能因为眼前的平稳而麻痹自己的思想，松懈压缩社会过高需求特别是投资需求规模的工作。
