The criminal investigation officer Li Dingguo from the Public Security Bureau of Xinyang County, Henan Province, the deputy director Zhang Wanyun of the Notary Office of the County Judicial Bureau, and the court bailiff Ma Mingcheng of the County People's Court have recently been arrested by law. The aggrieved masses saw the consequences of law enforcement officials breaking the law and felt a sense of relief.

In January 1987, Li Dingguo was given a demerit for raping a woman. He did not learn from his mistake. In September 1987, when he was investigating a case of stolen wood ear mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms in Tanjiahe Township, he discovered that a suspect had fled overnight. Li Dingguo summoned the suspect's wife, who was eight months pregnant, to a hotel for a private interrogation. He threatened and coaxed her, saying, "Don't worry, I won't arrest your husband, let him go." Then, he proceeded to molest and rape her. Later, Li tried his best to cover up for the criminal, allowing him to escape justice.

Zhang Wanyun, the deputy director of the Notary Office of the Xinyang County Judicial Bureau, used methods such as not registering or reporting cases, tearing up notary records, and not handing over fees to embezzle money. In April and May 1988, he embezzled 3,300 yuan in notary fees from a cotton yarn purchase and sale contract between Shisanli Bridge Agricultural and Commercial Trading Company and a company in Guangdong Province. Knowing that Shisanli Bridge Agricultural and Commercial Trading Company could not fulfill the contract, he issued a document allowing the company to sign a purchase and sale contract for 300 tons of aluminum ingots with the Xingxin Company's Xiamen Branch. He then pocketed another 3,500 yuan in notary fees. In total, he embezzled 6,800 yuan in notary fees.

Ma Mingcheng, a 25-year-old court bailiff from the Enforcement Division of the Xinyang County People's Court, met Guo, a manager of a store in Pingqiao, while performing a seizure and seal-up task in April 1988. He repeatedly asked Guo to sell him items such as refrigerators at a discount, but Guo refused. On August 27, Ma Mingcheng forged a court seizure order and a sale notice, forcibly selling a batch of alcohol from Guo's inventory at a 20% discount from the purchase price. On the evening of September 15, Ma went to Guo's home and demanded that Guo buy him two refrigerators. Guo was forced to purchase two Baiyun-brand refrigerators in Xinyang City for 2,850 yuan each and deliver them to Ma's home. Ma Mingcheng did not pay a single cent, only giving Guo a 3,600 yuan IOU, promising to repay the debt within two years.

　　执法犯法的下场
    河南省信阳县公安局刑警队侦察员李定国、县司法局公证处副主任张万云和县人民法院法警马明成，最近被依法逮捕了。受害的群众看到执法犯法者的如此下场，舒出了冤气。
    李定国在１９８７年１月就因为奸污妇女，受到行政记大过一次的处分。他并没有接受教训，在１９８７年９月，当他接受侦破谭家河乡一件白木耳和香菇被盗案时，发现一名案犯连夜外逃了。李定国传唤了这名案犯已怀孕８个多月的妻子，在旅店中进行单独询问。他又威胁又诱哄地说：“你放心，我不会逮你男人，跑了就算了……”接着，就动手动脚对她进行猥亵、强奸。以后，李便尽力为犯罪分子开脱，任其逍遥法外。
    信阳县司法局公证处的副主任张万云，是在１９８８年的４、５月间，采取受案不登记、不汇报或撕毁公证登记和收费不上交的手段，进行贪污，其中有十三里桥农工商购销公司与广东省某公司签定１３０吨棉纱购销合同的公证费３３００元。当他明知十三里桥农工商购销公司无力履行合同，竟又出据让这个公司与中国新兴公司厦门经营处签定３００吨铝锭的购销合同，又将３５００元公证费装入自己腰包。先后两次，共贪污公证费６８００元。
    年仅２５岁的信阳县人民法院执行庭法警马明成，１９８８年４月在执行扣押、查封任务时，认识了平桥某商场负责人郭某，他就多次向郭要“便宜买”为其扣押的电冰箱等物，被郭拒绝了。８月２７日，马明成竟盗用法院《扣押命令》和《变卖通知书》，强行按进价削减２０％变卖了郭某库存的一批酒。９月１５日晚上，马又跑到郭家，要郭为他买两台电冰箱，郭被迫到信阳市以每台２８５０元购买的两台白云牌电冰箱，运到了马家，马明成分文不付，仅给郭打了一张３６００元的欠款条，说是两年内还清欠款。
