	Between Advantages and Disadvantages
		Wang Qingxian

	Today, China has more than eight thousand joint ventures. You might not expect that the second-best joint venture in China for 1988 is not located on the coast but deep in the interior of Xinjiang. It is the Xinjiang Tian Shan Woolen Textile Company.

	When discussing the advantages and disadvantages of joint ventures in inland areas, the manager of Xinjiang Tian Shan Woolen Textile Company, Lu Changbao, has his own insights:

	Inland areas, especially places like Xinjiang, have poor information flow and inconvenient transportation. This makes the enterprise, from its inception, have a sense of crisis. They have to send dozens of people to monitor the coastal areas and major open cities, studying the changes in sweater colors and styles. Meanwhile, similar enterprises pay little attention to them. By the time their products become popular and even in short supply, others "discover" them, but the market has already been occupied. "It's like in a battle; you're in the shadows, and they're in the open. This is turning a disadvantage into an advantage," he said. "Look, last year, we had eight new styles awarded national prizes; in the national 'Snowy Plains Cup' sweater design competition, we won the first place in the team total score."

	Coastal enterprises often focus on the West. Xinjiang, being deep in the interior, is close to Arab countries. Thus, this textile company, on one hand, utilizes the advantages of the joint venture by sending designers to Hong Kong, Japan, and Paris to learn, and on the other hand, absorbs the serious and relaxed characteristics of Arab countries, forming its unique style. In the international market, it has unique competitiveness.

	Any condition has both advantages and disadvantages. A good business manager knows how to utilize advantages and turn disadvantages into advantages. For this reason, Tian Shan Woolen Textile Company, a joint venture with a registered capital of only eight million dollars in 1980, has now developed to 22 million dollars; the annual foreign exchange earnings have increased from over 2 million dollars at the start of operations to 22 million dollars.

　　优劣之间
    王清宪
    如今，中国有八千余家合资企业。你可能不会想到，一九八八年的全国十佳合资企业的第二名不是在沿海，而是在深深的内陆新疆，它就是新疆天山毛纺织品有限公司。
    谈起地处内陆的合资企业的优势劣势来，新疆天山毛纺织品有限公司经理陆长保颇有一番自己的见解：
    内陆——尤其像新疆这地方，信息不灵、交通不便，使企业一出生，就有一种危机意识。他们不得不派几十个人，盯住沿海及开放的大城市，琢磨羊毛衫色彩的变动，款式的更新，而同类企业，则很少注意到他们。等他们的产品畅销以至供不应求时，别人才“发现”他们，但市场已被他们占领了。“好比打仗，你在暗处，他在明处，这叫劣势变优势”。他说，“这不，去年一年，我们就有八个新款式获了国家奖；在全国‘雪原杯’羊毛衫设计大奖赛中获团体总分第一。”
    沿海的企业往往把目光盯住西方，新疆深居内陆，靠阿拉伯国家近，于是，这个纺织品公司一方面利用合资的优势派设计者到香港、日本、巴黎学习，同时，又吸收阿拉伯国家严肃、宽松的特点，形成了自己独特的款式风格，在国际市场上，有了独特的竞争力。
    任何条件，有优势也有劣势。好的企业经营者在于他善于利用优势，同时转劣势为优势。正因为如此，天山毛纺织品有限公司，这个一九八○年注册资本仅仅八百万美元的合资企业，如今发展到二千二百万美元；年创汇额由开业时的二百多万美元，增加到二千二百万美元。
