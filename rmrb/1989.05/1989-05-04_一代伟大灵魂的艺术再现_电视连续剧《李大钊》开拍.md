The television series "Li Dazhao" begins filming

BEIJING, May 4 (Xinhua) — "Only after understanding a great soul do I realize my own shallowness," said the entire creative team of the Beijing Television Art Center's "Li Dazhao" production group yesterday morning. With reverence, they pointed their cameras at the brilliant image of the great Marxist and one of the main founders of the Communist Party of China, Li Dazhao, beginning the filming of the ten-episode television series "Li Dazhao." The series is scheduled to be released on October 29, the 100th anniversary of Li Dazhao's birth, to meet with a wide audience.

The television series "Li Dazhao," created by Zhou Zhentian and others, intertwines historical and contemporary spaces, using the story of a young female sculptor creating a bronze statue of Li Dazhao and her investigations and interviews about the martyr's revolutionary life as the main plot. It truthfully reflects Li Dazhao's main revolutionary struggles from 1910 to 1927, vividly portraying the martyr's bold and daring, fearless heroism. The series features grand scenes and numerous characters, including historical figures such as Mao Zedong, Lu Xun, Chen Duxiu, Wang Jingwei, Zhang Zuolin, and Wu Peifu. The total investment for the series is planned to be 1 million yuan.

The director of the series is Wang Baohua, who has previously directed the trilogy "Zhou Enlai in Anyuan," "Zhou Enlai in Northeast China," and "Testimony."

Li Dazhao is portrayed by Li Xuejian from the Central Experimental Theater.
