On March 19 and 20, the public security bureau of Wenxi County in our province intercepted two trucks carrying aluminum wire and other materials. It was found that the scrap metal collection station run by Nie Jiqing and his son in Dongzhen Xuyang Village had illegally collected 14 tons of aluminum wire, power cables, electric motors, and other items.

Scrap collection and recycling are beneficial to the country and the people. However, in recent years, some scrap collection and recycling points have become hideouts for criminals to sell and hide stolen goods. Some scrap collectors and processors are directly involved in criminal activities. In February this year, two private aluminum product processing factories in Xinzhou City in our province were found to have 3,000 meters of aluminum wire, most of which came from private collection points. Recently, Yicheng County conducted a surprise inspection of seven collection stalls and found 3,580 meters of illegally collected aluminum wire. On March 15, the public security bureau of Hejin County discovered 4 trucks of materials at the private scrap collection point of Gao Tianhou in Shihui Village, including 3 power compensators, 1,500 meters of power cables, 1,050 meters of aluminum wire, 300 kilograms of copper wire, and 2 transformer cores. The investigation revealed three theft gangs. Surprisingly, some state-owned units have also joined in these illegal activities. In February this year, a theft gang sold 8 stolen transformers to the retail department of the Yanxin Scrap Material Recovery Company.

Relevant departments should strengthen the management of scrap collection points, thoroughly clean up and rectify the existing scrap collection points.

　　尽快整顿废品收购站点
    ３月１９日、２０日，我省闻喜县公安局截获两卡车铝线等物资，从中查出了东镇涑阳村聂吉庆父子开办的废旧金属收购站非法收购的铝线、电缆线、电动机等物品，达１４吨之多。
    废品收购与废品加工，本是利国利民的好事。但是，近几年来，一些废品收购站、加工点已成为犯罪分子销赃、窝赃的据点，有些废品收购和加工人员直接从事犯罪活动。今年２月，我省忻州市在两个个体铝制品加工厂查获铝线３０００多米，这些材料大部分来自个体收购站。我省翼城县最近对７个收购摊点突击检查，查获非法收购的铝线３５８０多米。３月１５日，河津县公安局在史惠村高天厚个体废品收购点查获４卡车物资，其中电力补偿器３台、电缆线１５００米、铝线１０５０米、铜线３００公斤、变压器芯２个。经审查，从中查出３个盗窃团伙。令人吃惊的是，一些国营单位也加入了这一非法活动。今年２月，一个盗窃团伙将偷来的８台变压器卖给了雁新废旧物资回收公司门市部。
    有关部门应加强对废旧物资收购站、点的管理，认真清理和整顿现有的废品收购站、点。
