Fairness Brings Cohesion

— Further Discussion on Building the Enterprise into a Community of Shared Destiny

We have already discussed that to make employees truly care about the enterprise, we must build the enterprise into a "community of shared destiny." We have also said that a community of shared destiny must be based on the common interests of all its members. This raises the question: how can we achieve this "commonality"? Theory and practice tell us that in the distribution of interests among members of the community, fairness is essential. Only fairness can achieve "commonality," only fairness can win people's hearts, and only fairness can motivate the enthusiasm of enterprise employees. So, how can we achieve fairness? In state-owned enterprises, it is to truly implement the principle of distribution according to work.

Distribution according to work is the basic principle of socialist distribution. However, due to the shortcomings of the old system, the imperfections of the new system during the transition period, and the many difficulties in implementing distribution according to work, this principle is still in a distorted state to a large extent today. This makes many employees feel that the distribution is unfair, including income comparisons, which are a direct and indirect reflection of this situation. A survey in Shanghai shows that one of the things that young employees are strongly dissatisfied with is the issue of distribution.

Currently, when people talk about unfair distribution, they often blame income disparities. In fact, egalitarianism and the "iron rice bowl" are also forms of unfairness. From a societal perspective, unreasonable income disparities can have a stimulating effect on people; but within an enterprise, especially a state-owned enterprise, egalitarianism is still the main form of "unfairness."

The process of building a community of shared destiny between the enterprise and employees at the Dezhou Cotton Textile Mill is a process of breaking away from egalitarianism and implementing the principle of distribution according to work. The principle of distribution according to work is not only a motivating force here, arousing people's enthusiasm for production; it is also a means of restraint, suppressing various ideas of gaining without working. Moreover, distribution according to work is the fairest distribution principle at this stage, an extremely important and even fundamental coordinating means. It is the basic principle for ensuring the smooth conduct of competition and coordinating conflicts among workers. Due to the implementation of this principle, each member feels that the enterprise is fair to them, and that working hard here has a future. Unconsciously, this gives the enterprise a strong cohesive force. With a sense of "fairness," the morale of the employees will improve.

Currently, there are sharp conflicts between some enterprise managers and employees. According to reports, a city in the south allowed factory directors and managers to carry electric batons to protect their personal safety. Those managers who carry electric batons may be admirable for their courage and spirit of reform. But this cannot be a regular practice; otherwise, it would be tragic. In such an enterprise, one should examine whether the principle of interest distribution is fair; whether the rules and regulations formulated are fair. If they are basically fair, then whether the managers have communicated this fairness to everyone, so that the majority of employees can understand. We are confident that the vast majority of enterprise employees will reach such a consensus: the key to the reform of the enterprise's distribution system lies in implementing the principle of distribution according to work. With such a consensus, the vast majority of people will unite, and it will be difficult for a small number of people to stir up trouble.

Of course, to fully implement the principle of distribution according to work within the enterprise, certain macro conditions are still needed, and these conditions are not yet fully met. However, we cannot wait for the conditions to be met before doing this work. In fact, there is still a lot of work to be done in this area within each enterprise. The improvement of the "microclimate" within each enterprise also helps to improve the "macroclimate."

### 公平才有凝聚力——再谈把企业建成命运共同体

　　公平才有凝聚力    
    ——再谈把企业建成命运共同体
    辛言
    我们已经说过，要使职工真正关心企业，必须把企业建成“命运共同体”；我们也说过，命运共同体必须建立在“共同体”所有成员利益一致的基础上，这就提出了一个问题：怎样才能做到这个“一致”？理论和实践告诉我们，在共同体成员间利益分配上，必须要公平，公平才可能实现“一致”，公平才可以服人，公平才可能调动企业职工的积极性。那么怎样才能公平呢？在公有制企业里，就是要真正地实行按劳分配原则。
    按劳分配是社会主义制度的基本分配原则。但是，由于旧体制的弊端，由于新旧交替时制度的不完善，也由于实施按劳分配有许多困难，今天这条原则在很大程度上仍处于一种被扭曲的状态，这就使许多职工感到分配的不公平，包括收入上的彼此攀比，也是这种状况的直接和间接的反映。上海市的一份调查表明，当前青年职工感到强烈不满的事情之一就是分配上的问题。
    当前，人们在谈到分配不公的时候，往往集中指责收入上的差距；其实，平均主义“大锅饭”是一种不公平。从全社会看，不合理的收入差距，对人们有刺激作用；但在一个企业里特别是国营企业内部，平均主义仍然是主要的“不公平”的表现形式。
    德州棉纺织厂在建立企业与职工的命运共同体的过程，就是打破平均主义，贯彻按劳分配原则的过程。按劳分配原则，在这里不仅是一种激励力量，唤起了人们的生产积极性；还是一种约束手段，它抑制了种种不劳而获的念头；同时，还要看到，按劳分配，是现阶段一种最公平分配原则，是一种非常重要的乃至基本的协调手段，它是保障竞争顺利进行和协调劳动者之间矛盾的基本原则。由于这种准则的实行，使每个成员感到企业对他是公平的，在这里好好干是有前途的，无形中就使企业具有了强大的凝聚力。有了“公平感”，职工的气就会顺的。
    现在某些企业的经营者同职工矛盾较为尖锐。据报载，南方某城市为了保护厂长经理们的人身安全，允许他们携带电棍。那些携带电棍的厂长经理们，也许改革的勇气和气概是令人钦佩的。但却不可以此作为常规，否则那将是可悲的，在这样的企业，应该检查一下，自己的利益分配原则是否是公平的；制订的规章制度是否是公平的。如果基本上是公平的，那么经营者是否把这种公平原原本本告诉大家，使广大职工都能理解。我们确信，企业绝大多数职工会取这样的共识：企业分配制度的改革，关键在于实行按劳分配原则。有了这样的共识，绝大多数人就会团结起来，极少数人也就难以兴风作浪了。
    当然，在企业里真正全面地贯彻按劳分配原则，还需要一定的宏观条件，现在还不完全具备这个条件。但是，我们不能等条件具备了再作这个工作。实际上，每个企业内部在这方面还是有许多工作可做的。每个企业“小气候”的改善，也有助于“大气候”的改善。
