Fan Yunliu, female, born in 1930, obtained her Ph.D. in biology from Leningrad University in the Soviet Union in 1960. After 1980, she worked as a visiting scholar at the University of Wisconsin and Northwestern University in the United States for two years. She is currently the director of the Biotechnology Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and a research fellow. She has published over 70 academic papers on molecular biology and genetic engineering.

Reporter: Our country's arable land is decreasing year by year, while the population is increasing year by year. If this trend continues, it will lead to food shortages. Apart from alleviating the contradiction between population and land, do you have any good methods to improve agricultural production efficiency?

Fan Yunliu: There are ways. As science and technology gradually replace land and labor, agriculture is shifting from relying solely on resources to relying on science. Technology promotes this transformation and drives the improvement of production efficiency. To solve the future food shortage problem, in addition to continuing to focus on the development of traditional conventional technologies, we should also adopt new technologies to significantly improve production efficiency. Here, the internationally emerging agricultural biotechnology will play a major role in improving agricultural production efficiency.

Reporter: What is agricultural biotechnology engineering? Why should it be given an important position?

Fan Yunliu: Biotechnology is a new technology, belonging to high technology. Agricultural biotechnology is a technological system based on biology, used for the commercial processing and production of agricultural products. It includes recombinant DNA, genetic material transfer, animal embryo manipulation and transfer, plant regeneration, cell culture, monoclonal antibodies, and bioengineering.

Agricultural biotechnology has enormous potential for improving crop production and animal husbandry. In crop production, it enables us to master new methods to cultivate high-yield, high-nutrition crop varieties, enhance crop resistance to diseases, pests, and adverse environments, reduce the use of fertilizers and other expensive pesticides, and minimize the disruption of ecological balance. In animal husbandry, its greatest and most direct potential is in the treatment and prevention of animal diseases, and the accelerated breeding of high-quality food.

Reporter: It seems that both domestic and international communities are paying attention to biotechnology. What is the current situation?

Fan Yunliu: Yes. The enormous potential of biotechnology has attracted global attention. The European Community countries have jointly organized the medium- and long-term "Eureka" plan for biotechnology development. The United States, Japan, Australia, India, Brazil, and other countries have formulated corresponding plans, investing large amounts of funds and substantial research forces to meet this challenge related to human survival and development. Our country has also timely formulated the "863" high-tech development plan, with biotechnology listed as the first development area, and agricultural biotechnology as an important component.

Reporter: So far, what progress and achievements has this science of agricultural biotechnology made? Is its application in agricultural production a distant matter?

Fan Yunliu: Currently, both domestically and internationally, agricultural biotechnology, especially crop biotechnology, has made rapid progress in both basic research and application.

In terms of basic research progress, there are three main aspects: First, in less than 10 years, a large number of genes that determine the useful traits of plants have been separated from the vast genetic background of plants, such as the specific genes that determine the protein content and composition of rice, corn, barley, and soybean seeds have all been separated, providing an important basis for increasing the protein content and improving the nutritional composition of these proteins. Genes related to disease resistance, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation in leguminous plants have also been successively separated. So far, more than a hundred plant genes have been separated, making these operations transition from fantasy to reality. Second, in 1983, scientists first transferred bacterial genes into the single cells of tobacco, and then regenerated complete plants from single cells. Such plants exhibited the traits of bacterial genes. The success of this experiment marked that humans can perform precise genetic operations on plants, making them mutate according to human wishes. So far, exogenous genes can be introduced into many crops such as rice, soybeans, cotton, and corn. In my laboratory, the regeneration of rice single cells into complete plants has been successful, and rice plants with exogenous genes have been obtained. The problem of exogenous gene introduction in wheat has also made breakthrough progress. Third, research has been conducted on how the genetic material that determines crop traits is expressed as traits (such as the process of seed formation, the expression of genetic information of seed storage protein genes, etc.). These studies provide a control basis for precisely controlling the useful traits of crops, increasing effective products, and improving yields.

Reporter: What breakthroughs have been made in practical applications?

Fan Yunliu: In practice, work has begun on aspects such as pest resistance, virus resistance, and herbicide resistance. Some genetic science companies and research institutions in the United States have successively reported genetically engineered plants resistant to pests, viruses, and herbicides. My laboratory recently transferred the genes of the pests that harm rice, the striped stem borer and the yellow stem borer, into rice, which is an important progress. Overseas and domestic units have also carried out extensive research on crop nutritional quality improvement, crop disease resistance, and drought resistance, achieving a number of eye-catching results. Therefore, agricultural biotechnology brings good opportunities for agricultural development, but it is accurate to say that agricultural biotechnology, especially crop improvement biotechnology, will not form an industry until the 21st century.

Reporter: Based on China's specific situation, do you have any suggestions for agricultural biotechnology?

Fan Yunliu: I think, first of all, we must start developing agricultural biotechnology from now on. It is not something that can be achieved overnight, but requires a large amount of basic research, knowledge accumulation, and technology reserves. The current international situation is that commercial competition has led to severe technology secrecy on a global scale. Without our own results and technology preparation, it will be very difficult to compete in the agricultural biotechnology market in the future. The training of agricultural biotechnology talents is also an urgent matter. Without sufficient talented and capable personnel as a backing, it will not work. Secondly, the state should formulate long-term stable development policies. Agricultural biotechnology, as a science, has its own objective laws of development, which need policy guarantees to ensure its healthy and sustained development. We should avoid two tendencies: one is to seek quick results, requiring crop improvement biotechnology to have varieties overnight, while neglecting the accumulation of technology and knowledge; the other is to underestimate the great role and potential of agricultural biotechnology, believing that since varieties cannot be obtained in the near future, high investment in this new technology is not necessary. In addition, we should pay attention to leveraging China's resource advantages, starting from China's national conditions, focusing on agricultural biotechnology research to solve the problem of food and nutrition, learning from foreign experience, but avoiding blindly following. As long as we start working on it now, China's agricultural biotechnology will have a bright future.

    农业困境将制约中国的发展
    现在就要为下个世纪做准备
    瞄准农业生物技术的研究
    本报记者  何黄彪
    范云六，女，1930年生，1960年获苏联列宁格勒大学生物学博士学位，1980年后作为访问学者在美国威斯康星大学及美国西北大学工作两年。现任中国农科院生物技术研究中心主任，研究员。她发表过70多篇关于分子生物学及基因工程的学术论文。
    记者：我国耕地逐年减少，而人口逐年增加，如果这样发展下去，就会带来食物短缺。你认为除了缓解人口与土地的矛盾外，还有什么好的办法提高农业生产效率？
    范云六：办法是有的。随着科学技术逐步取代土地和劳力，农业正在从单纯依靠资源转变为依靠科学。技术促进了这种转变，推动了生产效率的提高。为了解决今后食物短缺，除了继续重视发展传统的常规技术外，还应该采用新的技术大幅度提高生产效率。在这里，国际上蓬勃兴起的农业生物技术，将在提高农业生产效率上起着重大的作用。
    记者：什么叫农业生物技术工程？为什么要放到重要的位置？
    范云六：生物技术是一种新技术，属于高技术。农业生物技术是以生物为基础，用来发展商业性加工和生产农产品的技术体系。它包括重组DNA、遗传物质的转移、动物胚胎操作和转移、植物再生、细胞培养、单克隆抗体、生物加工工程等技术。
    农业生物技术对于改进作物生产、畜牧业都有巨大的潜力。在作物生产方面，它能使我们掌握一些新方法以培育高产、高营养的作物品种，提高作物抗病害、虫害以及抗不良环境的能力，减少肥料和其它昂贵农药用量，减少对环境生态平衡的破坏。在畜牧业方面，它的最大、最直接的潜力是畜病的治疗和病的防治，加速优质食物的培育。
    记者：现在，国内外好像都在注意抓生物技术，其情况如何？
    范云六：是的。生物技术的巨大潜力已引起了世界范围的重视。欧洲共同体国家联合组织了生物技术发展的中长期“尤里卡”计划，美国、日本、澳大利亚、印度、巴西等国家都制定了相应的计划，都投入了大量的资金和雄厚的科研力量，来迎接这场有关人类生存与发展的挑战。我国也及时制订了“863”高技术发展计划，生物技术被列为第一发展的领域，农业生物技术则是其重要的组成部分。
    记者：到目前为止，农业生物技术这门科学本身取得哪些进展和成果？它在农业生产中的应用是不是很遥远的事情？
    范云六：目前国内外农业生物技术，特别是作物生物技术在基础研究和应用方面进展很快。
    在基础研究的进展上主要有三个方面：一是在不到10年时间内，大量的决定植物有用性状的遗传基因从植物大量的基因背景中分离出来，如决定水稻、玉米、大麦、大豆等种子蛋白质含量以及组成的特定基因都已分离出来，为这些蛋白质含量的增加以及蛋白质中的营养成分的改良提供了重要的基础。决定这些作物的某些与抗病有关的基因，决定光合作用的基因、决定豆科作物固氮作用的基因等等，也相继得以分离。到目前为止，已有上百个植物基因得到分离，使这些操作的作用正在从幻想向实际转化。二是1983年科学家第一次把细菌基因转移到烟草的单细胞中，并进而从单细胞再生完整的植株，这样的植株表现了细菌基因的性状。这个实验的成功，标志着人类可以对植物进行遗传物质精细操作，使它按人类的愿望而变异。到目前为止，已经可以把外源基因导入到水稻、大豆、棉花、玉米等许多种作物。在我的研究室里，水稻单细胞成株已经成功，并得到了有外源基因的水稻植株。对小麦的外源导入这个难题也取得了突破性进展。三是对决定作物性状的遗传物质如何表现为性状这个复杂过程进行了研究（如种子形成过程，种子贮存蛋白基因的遗传信息表达等）。这些研究为精细地控制作物有用性状、增加有效产物以及提高产量等提供了控制基础。
    记者：在实际应用方面有何突破？
    范云六：在实践方面，已开始了抗虫害、抗病毒、抗除草剂等方面的工作。美国一些遗传科学公司和研究单位，相继报道了抗虫的基因工程植株、抗病毒的基因工程植株、抗除草剂的基因工程植株。我的研究室，最近把杀水稻的二化螟和三化螟害虫的基因转移到水稻中，这是一个重要的进展。国外及国内的一些单位在作物营养品质改良、作物抗病、抗干旱方面也开展了大量的研究，取得一批令人瞩目的成果。因此，农业生物技术给农业发展带来了很好的机会，但确切地讲，农业生物技术特别是作物改良的生物技术要到21世纪才能形成产业。
    记者：根据我国具体情况，你对农业生物技术有什么建议？
    范云六：我觉得，首先必须从现在起发展农业生物技术。它不是一朝一夕就可得到的成果，而需要大量的基础研究、知识储备和技术储备。目前国际情况是，商业竞争使得在世界范围内技术保密严重，没有自己的成果和技术准备，是很难在将来与国际竞争农业生物技术的市场。农业生物技术人才的培养也是当务之急，没有足够的精明强干的人才作后盾，就不行。其次，国家要制定长期稳定的发展政策。农业生物技术作为一门科学，有它发展的客观规律，需要政策的保证，使得它健康持久地发展。要避免两种倾向，一种是急功近利，要求作物改良的生物技术一朝一夕就要有品种，而忽视技术的储备和知识的积累，另一种是低估农业生物技术的巨大作用和潜力，认为既然不能在近期内得到品种，就不应该高投资搞这项新技术。此外，还要注意发挥我国资源特点，从我国国情出发，着重解决温饱，增加营养的农业生物技术的研究，借鉴国外的经验，但切忌盲从。只要我们扎扎实实从现在抓起，我国农业生物技术就会前途广阔。
