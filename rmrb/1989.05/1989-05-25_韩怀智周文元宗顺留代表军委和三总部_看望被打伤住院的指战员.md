Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th.

Han Huizhi, Zhou Wenyuan, and Zong Shunliu, representing the Central Military Commission and the Three General Departments, visited 29 injured soldiers in the hospital today. These soldiers were injured while performing their duties in the martial law enforcement in parts of the capital.

The injured soldiers were attacked on May 22nd in the afternoon while the troops were being transferred. They were struck with stones and bricks by unidentified individuals. Reporters saw that some soldiers had multiple injuries on their heads and hands, with some still swollen despite treatment.

Han Huizhi, Zhou Wenyuan, and Zong Shunliu told the injured soldiers, "The leaders of the Central Military Commission and the Three General Departments are very concerned about everyone's injuries. They have sent us to visit you. You have shown great political awareness by enduring hardships and difficulties in enforcing martial law. Even when faced with attacks, insults, and injuries, you have shown great restraint and tolerance. Your exemplary actions show that you are not here to suppress the people or deal with young students. Instead, you are here to stop the turmoil, maintain social order in the capital, and protect the lives and property of the capital's people. Your mission is glorious and will surely gain the understanding and support of the capital's people, including young students, as well as the understanding and support of the people across the country."

The injured soldiers expressed their gratitude for the concern of the Military Commission and the General Departments' leaders, and vowed to recover quickly. They also pledged to complete the martial law enforcement tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, with the support of the capital's people and young students.

　　韩怀智周文元宗顺留代表军委和三总部
    看望被打伤住院的指战员
    新华社北京５月２５日电  人民解放军副总参谋长韩怀智、总政治部副主任周文元、总后勤部副部长宗顺留代表中央军委领导同志和三总部机关，今天下午前往解放军３０４医院看望在执行首都部分地区戒严任务中被打伤住院的２９名指战员。
    这批伤员是５月２２日下午在部队转移途中被一些不明身份的人用石块、砖头击伤的。记者在病房里看到，有的战士头部、手部受伤达六七处之多，有的虽经治疗伤部依然红肿。
    韩怀智、周文元、宗顺留对伤员们说，中央军委领导和三总部机关的同志听说大家受伤后，很关心、很惦念，委派我们来看望大家。你们在执行戒严任务中，不怕苦，不畏难，表现了很高的政治觉悟。在遭到围攻、辱骂甚至被打伤的情况下，你们仍然表现了极大的克制和忍让。你们以自己的模范行动表明，你们不是来镇压群众的，也不是来对付青年学生的，而是为了制止动乱、维护首都的社会秩序、保护首都人民生命财产的安全而来的。你们的任务是光荣的，一定会得到包括青年学生在内的首都人民的理解和支持，也一定会得到全国人民的理解和支持。
    伤员们表示，感谢军委、总部首长的关怀，要争取早日痊愈，在首都人民和青年学生的支持下，完成好党中央、国务院、中央军委交给的戒严任务。
