For many Chinese people, sports seem to be something that only athletes do, not something they can participate in themselves.

In Beijing's Temple of the Sun Park, a quiet and clean place, a group of long-distance running enthusiasts gather every Saturday morning. They come from various professions and have spontaneously formed a long-distance running team of over a hundred people. Long-distance running has become their common fitness activity, but its meaning is different for each person.

Not Satisfied Until Becoming a Champion

An amateur long-distance runner has reached the standard of a first-class athlete but is still not satisfied, which requires a lot of sweat. However, Yao Licheng does not doubt his abilities. This worker from the Beijing City Construction Group is slim and agile. During his time in the engineering corps, he developed a deep affection for long-distance running. He has been in the running team for over a decade. In recent years, he has repeatedly attempted to break the 2-hour 22-minute marathon standard for becoming a sports champion.

"Amateur training, no guaranteed time, truly heart has more than strength. But at 36 years old, I should get a champion certificate to show my wife, so these ten-plus years of running won't be in vain."

Competing with the Young

In the running team, 50-year-old Yu Yongjiang competes with the young, willing to improve his performance with them, even if it means enduring more hardship.

He started running in 1983. At that time, he suffered from Ménière's disease and stomach problems. Persistent training made his body stronger than before, and he is very proud of it. In the past two years, the running team was adjusted, and some older members were transferred to the Beijing Long March Senior Citizens' Running Team. Yu Yongjiang did not leave.

"Running with those old men is not interesting. My heart rate is 50 beats per minute, and every training session I run 5 laps around the Temple of the Sun Park, over 10,000 meters, I can keep up with the young men without any problems." This is Yu Yongjiang's ambition.

For this, he trains day after day.

The Joy of Running Itself

Liu Yiming from the Institute of Journalism and Communication of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences is tall and strong. He doesn't look like a runner, and his running form is stiff and awkward. After practicing for seven or eight years, he barely reached the second-class standard, and even his wife doesn't understand what he is after.

"Overcoming physiological obstacles through long-distance running and achieving a sense of success is real and endless."

Liu Yiming enjoys running, never misses a training session, and participates in every competition.

Gaining Abundant Energy

Some middle-aged intellectuals have been worn down by heavy work, leading to premature death. Guan Leiyang does not want such misfortune. He lives in the "Science and Technology City" of Zhongguancun and is an engineer at the Beijing Institute of Aeronautics. His work and life are both going smoothly. Every Saturday, he punctually comes to the Temple of the Sun Park. His goal is to have a strong physique, which cannot be fully achieved by improving the work environment and living conditions. He says, "I admire the three sentences carved on the cliffs of ancient Greece 2,500 years ago: If you want to be strong, run! If you want to be beautiful, run! If you want to be smart, run!"

### 重要的是参与——记北京业余马拉松队

　　重要的是参与   
    ——记北京业余马拉松队
    本报记者  李北大
    在更多的中国人心目中，体育似乎永远是属于运动员而不是自己的事。
    北京的日坛公园，一块静谧整洁的地方，每星期六早晨活跃着一群长跑爱好者。他们从事的行业各异，自发聚成上百人的长跑队。长跑成为他们共同的健身活动，而意义对于每个人又不尽相同。
    不达健将不罢休
    一名业余长跑爱好者，已达到一级运动员标准，还不满足，这可要赔上太多的汗水。但姚立成并不怀疑自己的能力。这位北京城建总公司工人瘦小精悍，在部队当工程兵时就与长跑结下不解之缘，进长跑队一练就是十几年。近几年他几次冲击２小时２２分的马拉松运动健将标准。
    “业余训练，时间没保证，真是心有余而力不足。不过，３６岁的人了，该拿个健将证书让老婆瞧瞧，咱这十几年也算没白跑。”
    和年轻人一起竞争
    在长跑队，５０岁的余永江和年轻人摽上了劲，他愿意和年轻人一起提高成绩，即使要多吃点苦头。
    他１９８３年参加长跑，那时他患美尼尔氏症和胃病。不懈地练跑，身体比以前结实了，他很得意。前两年长跑队调整，一些老同志被淘汰到北京长征老年人长跑队去了。余永江没有走。
    “跟那些老头子在一起跑没意思。我的脉搏每分钟５０次，每次训练绕日坛公园５圈，１万多米，我能不含糊地和小伙子一样跑下来。”这就是余永江的雄心。
    为此，他苦练着，一天又一天。
    长跑本身其乐无穷
    社会科学院新闻所的刘一鸣，又高又壮，看外形不像长跑的料，跑步动作吃力僵硬，练七八年勉强达到２级，连爱人也不明白他到底图个啥。
    “通过长跑，克服生理机能障碍而产生的成功感是实实在在的，乐趣无穷。”
    刘一鸣喜欢跑，训练一次不落，逢比赛便参加。
    换来充沛的精力
    一些中年知识分子被繁重的工作搞垮身体，以致英年早逝。关雷洋可不想有这样的不幸。他住在“科技城”中关村，是北京航空学院工程师，工作、生活都很顺心。每周六他准时来到日坛公园。他的目的是要有一个强健的体魄，这不能全靠改善工作环境和生活条件来解决。他说，“我欣赏两千五百年前古希腊山崖上刻着的三句话：如果你想健壮，跑步吧！如果你想健美，跑步吧！如果你想聪明，跑步吧！”
