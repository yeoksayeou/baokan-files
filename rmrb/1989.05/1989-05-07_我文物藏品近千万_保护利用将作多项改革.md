China (excluding Taiwan Province) has a total of 9,947,692 cultural relics, among which 168,295 are classified as first-grade national treasures.

According to statistics from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, due to the emphasis on the survey, collection, and preservation of cultural relics, the number of national treasures has been increasing year by year, with particularly notable achievements in recent years. In 1988, the number of cultural relics increased by 673,522 items; however, due to theft and poor preservation, the number of first-grade items decreased by 435. Experts attending the National Cultural Relics Work Conference commented that this is one of the most developed periods for China's cultural relics industry, but it is also a period facing the most challenges.

The main problems are as follows: the number of major cases of theft and looting of cultural relics is increasing; there is a lack of awareness of cultural relics protection among the general public, leading to severe human-induced damage; the funds for cultural relics protection are severely insufficient, making it difficult to address theft and damage and repair the damage after the fact.

To address the difficulties facing the cultural relics industry, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, while emphasizing the social benefits of cultural relics, has begun to consider multiple reforms for the utilization of cultural relics. Within the permitted scope, it will improve the methods of using cultural relics to enhance their economic benefits. The cultural relics departments will publish in batches a list of particularly valuable cultural relics known domestically and internationally, allowing only the cultural relics management departments designated by the state to replicate and sell them, achieving "quality over quantity." It will also plan and produce and publish cultural relics audio-visual products and publications in a systematic and graded manner. The State Administration of Cultural Heritage revealed that a "China Cultural Relics Exchange Service Center" has been established, entrusted by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage to manage the cultural relics exchange services, organizing, coordinating, and engaging in various business activities such as overseas exhibitions, cultural relics replication, cultural relics tourism, cultural relics film and television, as well as cultural relics consulting and services.

　　我文物藏品近千万    
    保护利用将作多项改革
    本报北京５月７日讯  记者齐欣报道：我国（不包括台湾省）共有文物藏品９９４７６９２件，其中被称为“国宝”的一级品为１６８２９５件。
    据国家文物局的统计，由于重视文物的普查、收集和保管，国家珍存的文物数目逐年上升，近年来成绩尤为突出。１９８８年文物增加６７３５２２件；但由于失窃和保护不善等原因，同时一级品又减少了４３５件。参加全国文物工作会议的专家们就此评述说，目前可称作中国文物事业最发达的时期之一，但同时也是面临难题最多的时期。
    这些难题主要表现在：盗掘盗窃文物大案猛增；全民缺乏文物保护意识，人为破坏严重；保护文物的资金严重不足，以致于面临盗窃和破坏无力亡“羊”补牢……
    为了改变文物事业面临的困难局面，国家文物局在强调文物的社会效益前提下，已开始设想对文物利用做多项改革。在允许的范围内改善文物的使用方法，以提高文物的经济效益。文物部门将分批公布一批驰名国内外的特别珍贵的文物名单，只允许国家规定的文物主管部门对其进行复制和销售，做到“以少胜多，以精取胜”；还将有计划、分档次、成系列地制作和发行文物音像制品和书刊。国家文物局透露，已成立了一个名为“中国文物交流服务中心”的机构，受国家文物局委托，行使文物对外交流服务的管理职能，组织、协调和从事出国展览、文物复制、文物旅游、文物影视以及文物咨询、服务等各项经营活动。
