Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 17th.

The League of Communists of Yugoslavia's Macedonian branch has elected Milan Panchevski, 54, a representative of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, as the new chairman of the Central Committee. He succeeds Shuvari, who was elected as a member of the Federal Presidency two days ago.

According to the decision made at the 17th Plenum of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which called for the separation of party and government, Shuvari requested to be relieved of his duties as chairman of the Central Committee, member of the Central Committee, and member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Shuvari's term was originally set to expire in mid-June. According to the regulations, the position of the next chairman of the Central Committee should be held by a representative of the Macedonian League of Communists. The Macedonian League of Communists nominated two candidates. As a result, Panchevski won with 17 votes out of 23 members of the Central Committee. He will hold this position until the end of the year when the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's Congress is convened. At that time, another representative from a different republic's League of Communists will take over his position. Panchevski was born in 1935 in the Macedonian city of Debar and joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1957. He has held various leadership positions in the Social Alliance, Parliament, and the League of Communists.

　　南共盟选出新中央主席    
    潘切夫斯基接替舒瓦尔
    新华社贝尔格莱德五月十七日电（记者王森）南斯拉夫马其顿共盟在南共联盟中央主席团的代表、五十四岁的米兰·潘切夫斯基十七日当选为南共盟中央主席团主席。他是接替两天前当选为南联邦主席团委员的舒瓦尔的职务的。
    根据南共联盟第十七中全会作出的党政分离的决定，舒瓦尔要求解除他担任的南共联盟中央主席团主席、中央主席团委员和中央委员的职务。舒瓦尔本应到今年六月中旬才任期届满。按照规定，下任中央主席团主席职务应由马其顿共盟的代表担任。马其顿共盟提出了二名候选人。结果，在二十三名中央主席团委员中，潘切夫斯基以十七票的多数取胜。他将担任这一职务到年底召开南共联盟代表大会时为止。届时将由另一共和国共盟代表接替他的职务。潘切夫斯基一九三五年生于马其顿城市德巴尔，一九五七年加入南共联盟。他曾在社盟、议会和共盟中担任过多项领导职务。
