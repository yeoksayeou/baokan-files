Though astronauts are exploring space today, land remains the foundation of human survival and the primary stage for human activity. However, the "devouring circle" is tightening.

Deserts are advancing like yellow dragons into farmlands and pastures. One-third of the world's land is threatened by desertification, with 90 million acres of land turning into desert each year. The Sahara Desert in Africa is expanding at a rate of 30-50 kilometers per year, with a frontline of moving sand over 3,500 kilometers wide. Surrounding countries lose 500,000 to 1.5 million acres of pasture and farmland annually.

Water erosion severely damages farmlands. The United States loses approximately 3 billion tons of soil each year due to water erosion. In recent years, one-third of the Soviet Union's arable land has been affected by water erosion, with 7 million tons of nitrogen and phosphorus washed away annually.

Wind is a formidable enemy of soil. In Venezuela and Chile, wind erosion affects 60% and 55% of arable land, respectively. Sand from Africa sometimes blows to the British Isles, and loess from China's North China Plain is carried by wind across the Pacific Ocean to the Hawaiian Islands. The United States and the Soviet Union have frequently experienced windstorms that leave vast areas of topsoil bare.

Humans have also joined the ranks of land devourers. In the United States, industrial and urban development consumes about 6 million acres of land each year. In the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, land surface destruction due to underground resource exploitation ranges from 300,000 to 450,000 acres annually. In Italy, agricultural land is swallowed by construction projects at a rate equivalent to the area of Rome, about 700,000 acres per year. Meanwhile, pollutants from human production and life are discharged into the land, altering the composition, structure, and function of the soil, damaging the land's vitality. Deforestation further strips the soil of its protective cover.

These combined factors create a "devouring circle" that threatens human survival.

Currently, the world's arable land totals 21.9 billion acres, accounting for 11% of the land surface and supporting over 5 billion people. However, this devouring war has severely damaged global soil, with over 25 billion tons of arable land soil lost each year, and the rate is accelerating. From the early 19th century to the mid-20th century, the per capita arable land remained stable at 7.5 acres per person. However, in the past 30 years, the growth rate of arable land has significantly slowed, soil loss has become severe, and land resources are increasingly strained. If this devouring war is not controlled, by the end of this century, one-third of the world's arable land will disappear, and per capita arable land will drop to 2.2 acres, leading to disastrous consequences.

On the other hand, due to population growth, the pressure on land is increasing, while soil quality is deteriorating, resulting in severe impacts on social and economic development and living standards. About three-quarters of the world's arid lands have seen a 25% decline in productivity. Africa's per capita grain production is declining annually, leading to famine and mass deaths during droughts. Developed countries are also affected by soil resource loss. The United States loses $60-70 billion annually in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium due to land erosion. A scholar from Moscow stated that the Soviet Union's long-term neglect of soil erosion has led to severe soil damage. Recent statistics from the United Kingdom show that wind and rain erosion threaten more than half of the country's topsoil.

Fortunately, many countries are taking measures in social, economic, and technological aspects, such as afforestation, desert reclamation, and rational fertilization, to address the soil crisis and have begun to see results. The United States, during 1986-1987, enacted laws to convert 240 million acres of severely eroded farmland (11% of the nation's farmland) into pastures and forests, along with other measures, achieving a record reduction of 460 million tons of farmland erosion. Australia invested 700,000 Australian dollars in a soil protection plan. Czechoslovakia implemented policies to limit the use of arable land for economic purposes and prohibited residential construction on good land, reversing the decline in agricultural land. Singapore, with its small land area and severe land shortage, dissolved all loss-making and barren state-owned farms, replacing them with "park-style" small-scale high-tech farms.

Today, more and more countries are calling for action: for human survival and development, we must rely on the support of the earth. Protecting the land is an urgent global task.

　　在宇航员遨游太空的今天，土地仍然是人类生存的基础和活动的主要舞台，  可是——
    “蚕食圈”在紧缩
    张友新
    沙漠犹如黄色的巨龙向农田和牧场进逼，全球１／３的土地面临沙漠化的危险，每年有９０００万亩土地变为沙漠。非洲的撒哈拉沙漠每年以３０—５０公里的速度向外扩张，南部流沙前沿的总宽达３５００公里以上，周围国家每年损失５０万亩—１５０万亩的牧场和耕地。
    水蚀严重毁坏农田。美国每年因此损失的土壤约３０亿吨。近几年，苏联有１／３的耕地遭到水蚀，每年被水冲走的氮和磷达７００万吨。
    风是土壤的劲敌。委内瑞拉和智利受风蚀的土地分别占可耕地总面积的６０％和５５％。非洲的沙土有时被吹到英伦三岛“落户”，中国华北平原的黄土被风卷起，竟横渡太平洋到夏威夷群岛“登陆”。美国、苏联等国曾屡次遭到风暴袭击，过后大片耕层土壤消失殆尽。
    人类也加入了蚕食土地的行列。在美国，工业和城市的发展每年占去的土地约６００多万亩，英国和苏联每年因开采地下资源而破坏的地表都在３０—４５万亩之间，意大利农业用地每年被建设项目吞噬的土地，相当于罗马市区的面积，约７０万亩。同时，人类在生产和生活中产生污染物向土地排放，引起土壤系统的成分、结构和功能的变化，伤了土地的“元气”。滥伐森林又使土壤失去了“保护伞”。
    上述各种因素综合作用，形成了一个当今世界上到处可见的“蚕食圈”，威胁着人类的生存。
    眼下，世界耕地面积为２１９亿亩，占陆地面积的１１％，养育着５０多亿人口。然而，这场蚕食战造成了世界土壤的严重破坏，每年有２５０多亿吨耕地土壤流失，并且这个速度还在加快。从１９世纪初到本世纪５０年代，世界人均占有耕地数保持稳定，即每人平均７．５亩，但是近３０年来耕地面积增长速度明显减缓，土壤流失十分严重，土地资源日趋吃紧。这场蚕食战如得不到控制，本世纪末全世界将有１／３的可耕地消失，人均耕地将降至２．２亩，人类面临灾难性后果。
    另一方面，由于人口膨胀，土地承受的压力在增加，而土质却不断退化，结果是社会经济的发展和生活水平的提高受到严重影响。世界上约有３／４的干旱地的生产力已下降２５％。非洲大陆的人均粮食逐年下降，每逢大旱即出现饥荒，大批人死亡。发达国家也受到土壤资源流失的困扰。美国每年由于土地侵蚀而损失氮、磷、钾的肥分价值高达６０—７０亿美元。莫斯科一位学者说，苏联长期以来对土壤侵蚀采取置若罔闻的态度，致使“土壤遭到严重破坏”。英国最近公布的统计表明，风雨侵蚀已危及全国一半以上的耕地表土。
    可喜的是，目前，不少国家在社会、经济、科技等方面采取对策，如植树造林、改造沙漠、合理施肥等等，以对付土壤危机，开始取得成效。美国在１９８６—１９８７年期间，用法令规定把２．４亿亩严重侵蚀的耕地（占全国耕地的１１％）变为牧场和森林，并付之其他措施，取得了耕地侵蚀减少４．６亿吨的创纪录成绩。澳大利亚耗资７０万澳元实施一项土壤保护计划。捷克斯洛伐克实行以经济手段限制占用耕地、住宅建设一律不能占用好地等政策，已扭转了农用地减少的局面。新加坡国土面积小，土地紧缺的矛盾突出，所以解散了所有亏本、荒地的国营农场，代之以“公园式”小块高技术农田。
    今天，愈来愈多的国家呼吁，人类要生存，要发展，必须依靠大地的支撑，保护土地是一项全球性的紧迫任务。
