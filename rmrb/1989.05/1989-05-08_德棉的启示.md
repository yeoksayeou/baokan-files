The Lessons from the Dezhou Cotton Mill

The Dezhou Cotton Mill has given us an important lesson: to build enterprises into "communities of shared destiny."

The relationship between enterprises and employees, which seems like a straightforward issue, has become increasingly prominent with the deepening of reforms.

In some enterprises, especially state-owned ones, there are widespread issues of low employee productivity and labor efficiency. Moreover, there is a common phenomenon where employees "collaborate" with or "pressure" factory directors to exploit the state, engaging in short-term behaviors that prioritize personal gains over the development of the enterprise.

To address this problem, some economists propose accelerating the reform of enterprise ownership to enhance employees' concern for enterprise assets. Political workers advocate strengthening ideological and political work to rekindle employees' sense of duty and responsibility. Factory directors and managers complain about the difficulty in dealing with incompetent workers, despite the authority granted by the Enterprise Law. Employees, on the other hand, feel that with the implementation of the director responsibility system, democratic management should be strengthened.

These discussions, although differing in perspective, level, and specific views, reveal a common trend when we look at enterprises that have achieved remarkable results in reform. Both theory and practice point to the need to promote the idea of building enterprises into communities of shared destiny for employees.

The concept of a "community of shared destiny" refers to a close relationship between the enterprise and its employees, characterized by shared interests, risks, and honor and disgrace. The enterprise becomes a carrier of everyone's shared destiny.

This community of shared destiny is first built on the basis of material interest consistency between the enterprise and employees, among employees, and between employees and managers. Our socialist system inherently provides the possibility for achieving this consistency. However, under the old system, the two "big iron rice bowls" hindered the transformation of this possibility into reality. Individuals' contributions to the enterprise and the state were not properly linked to their own destinies, breaking the bond of the community of shared destiny. This is the fundamental reason for the lack of cohesion in enterprises and the lack of initiative among employees.

Since the reform, we have started to break the "big iron rice bowls," but another situation has emerged: some people, including some employees and managers, do not seek their interests through improving the enterprise and increasing productivity. Instead, they try every means to exploit the enterprise to expand their consumption funds. This actually undermines the carrier of everyone's shared interests.

The idea of building a community of shared destiny should also be an important guiding ideology for our reforms. Reform is about making the interests of the state, enterprises, and individuals more harmonious, and making the interests of various parts of society more coordinated. We should gradually move towards this goal in our ideological education, systems, policies, and measures.

　　德棉的启示
    辛言
    把企业建成“命运共同体”，这是德州棉纺厂给我们的重要启示。
    企业与职工，究竟是什么关系？这个似乎不成问题的问题，随着改革的深入日益变得突出起来了。
    在一些企业，特别是国营企业，不仅存在着职工生产积极性不高、劳动生产率低的现象，而且较普遍地存在着职工“联合”或“逼迫”厂长一起算计国家，搞只求多拿多分，不管企业发展的短期行为。
    为了解决这个问题，一些经济学家提出要加快企业所有制的改革，以提高职工对企业资产的关切度；政工人员则呼吁要加强思想政治工作，重新唤起职工的事业心和责任感；厂长经理们抱怨现在难以处置不称职的工人——尽管《企业法》赋予了他们这样的权力；职工们则觉得实行厂长经理负责制后，应该加强民主管理……
    这些议论，虽然角度不同、层次不同，具体见解也不尽相同，但如果我们把目光投向那些在改革中取得显著成效的企业，再来研究这个问题，就会发现，理论和实践都趋向一个共同点，那就是应该提倡把企业建成职工的命运共同体。
    所谓“命运共同体”，是指企业与职工之间建立起的一种利益共享、风险共担、荣辱与共的紧密关系，企业成为大家共同命运的载体。
    这种命运共同体首先是建立在企业和职工之间、职工和职工之间、职工和经营者之间物质利益一致性的基础上的。我们的社会主义制度本来提供了实现这种一致的可能性，但在旧体制下两个“大锅饭”，妨碍着把这种可能性变成现实性。个人对企业和国家的贡献，同自己的命运没有正确的联系，命运共同体的纽带被隔断了。这正是企业缺乏凝聚力，职工缺乏积极性的根本原因。
    改革以来，我们着手打破“大锅饭”，但同时也出现了另一种情况：一些人，包括部分职工和经营者，不是从搞好企业、发展企业去求得自己的利益，不是在提高劳动生产率的基础上求得生活的改善，而是想方设法靠挖企业来扩大自己的消费资金。这实际上是在破坏大家共同利益的载体。
    建立命运共同体的思想，其实也应该是我们进行改革的重要指导思想。改革，就是要使国家、企业和个人的利益更加协调，使社会各部分人之间的利益更加协调。我们应该在思想教育、制度、政策和措施上一步一步朝着这个目标前进。
