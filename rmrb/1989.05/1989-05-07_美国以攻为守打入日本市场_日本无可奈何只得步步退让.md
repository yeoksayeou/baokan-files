Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 7th.

In the face of the new, powerful trade offensive from the United States, it appears that Japan will have to make concessions to the U.S. Before and after the visit of Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry, Mitsumoto Hiroshi, to Washington, the U.S. Trade Representative's office took two major actions targeting Japan: On April 28, it released the "1989 Trade Barrier Report"; on May 3, it announced sanctions on 58 Japanese products and services.

In the U.S.-Japan economic and trade relations, the U.S. has adopted an "offensive defense" strategy. It is no longer just passively restricting Japanese goods from entering the U.S., but is actively breaking down various barriers in Japan to allow U.S. products to enter the Japanese domestic market.

Facing the U.S.'s high-pressure policies, the Japanese are inwardly furious, but outwardly they dare not show it. Japan has, in recent years, adopted a conciliatory and compromising attitude towards the U.S.'s economic demands. This time will be no exception. It is said that the Japanese government has already begun studying a compromise plan with the U.S., with three main points: the Japanese government will purchase $1 billion worth of goods from the U.S.; promote private enterprises to expand imports; and relax domestic distribution restrictions to facilitate the sale of foreign products.

It is easy to imagine that, regarding the issue of whether to launch or postpone/cancel sanctions against Japan, there will inevitably be fierce and repeated negotiations between the U.S. and Japan. However, the result will still be Japan making concessions and retreating.

### 美国以攻为守打入日本市场  日本无可奈何只得步步退让

　　美国以攻为守打入日本市场   
    日本无可奈何只得步步退让
    据新华社东京５月７日电  （记者张可喜）在美国的新的强大贸易攻势面前，看来日本还是要向美国作出让步。在日本通产相三塚博访问华盛顿前后，美国贸易代表办公室采取了两项主要是针对日本的行动：４月２８日，发表了“１９８９年度贸易壁垒报告”；５月３日，宣布将对日本的５８种商品和服务进行制裁措施。
    美国在对日经济贸易关系上采取了“以攻为守”的策略。它不再只是被动地限制日本商品进入美国，而是积极地打破日本的各种封锁，让美国产品进入日本国内市场。
    面对美国的高压政策，日本人内心深处愤怒异常，但是表面上不好发作。日本对美国的经济要求，近年来一直采取委曲求全、妥协让步的态度。这次也不会例外。据说，日本政府早已在研究对美妥协方案，其要点有三：日本政府向美国购货１０亿美元；促进民间企业扩大进口；缓和国内流通领域的限制，以利国外产品的销售。
    不难设想，围绕着是发动还是推迟、取消对日制裁措施的问题，日美两国间免不了要进行激烈的、反复的讨价还价，但是结果仍将是日方作出妥协、让步。
