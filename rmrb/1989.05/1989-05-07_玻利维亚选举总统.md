Over 2 million Bolivian voters will cast their ballots tomorrow to elect a new president and legislators. This is the third time this country, which has a history of frequent coups, is holding a general election. Nine political parties have fielded their respective candidates for the presidency, with only three having a realistic chance of winning. One is Hugo Banzer of the Nationalist Democratic Action Party. This retired general came to power through a military coup in 1971 and ruled until 1978. Reports indicate that Banzer's party enjoys the support of large landowners. Another strong contender is Paz Zamora of the Revolutionary Left Movement. Zamora, 50, served as Vice President under Siles Zuazo (1982-1985). The third candidate with a chance is Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada of the ruling Revolutionary Nationalist Movement. He previously served as the Planning Minister in the current government and is a wealthy industrialist.

According to the Bolivian Constitution, if no candidate secures more than half of the votes (an absolute majority) in the presidential election, the two chambers of Congress will convene to decide between the two candidates who received the most votes.

　　玻利维亚选举总统
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯５月６日电  记者李志明报道：２００多万玻利维亚选民明天将投票选举新任总统和议员。这是这个历史上政变频繁的国家第三次举行大选。共有９个政党推出各自的候选人竞选总统，其中只有三位有可能当选。一个是民族主义民主行动党的乌戈·班塞尔，这位退休将军１９７１年发动军事政变上台执政到１９７８年。据报道，班塞尔的党得到大种植园主的支持。另一个有希望的候选人是左派革命运动的帕斯·萨莫拉。萨莫拉今年５０岁，曾任西莱斯总统（１９８２—１９８５）的副总统。第三位是执政党革命民族主义运动的贡萨洛·桑切斯·德洛萨达。他曾任现政府的计划部长，是一位富有的工业家。
    按照玻利维亚宪法，在总统选举中如果没有一个候选人得票超过半数（绝对多数），将由议会两院联席会议在２名得票最多的候选人当中决定。
