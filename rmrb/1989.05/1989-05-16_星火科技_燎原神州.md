The Spark Program, implemented in 1985, has made remarkable strides in just three years. Its footprint now covers over 2,000 counties across 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions on the mainland.

The State Science and Technology Commission recently released statistics showing that by the end of 1988, a total of 17,322 Spark Program projects at the national, provincial, municipal, and county levels had been approved. Of these, 5,106 projects have been completed, generating a new output value of 11.2 billion yuan and creating 3.62 billion yuan in taxes. It is projected that within a few years, once all these projects are completed, the new output value will exceed 40 billion yuan, with an annual tax revenue of 8.4 billion yuan. This is a significant figure.

When the Spark Program was launched, its goal was to establish 500 demonstration enterprises by 1990, develop 100 sets of technologies suitable for rural and township enterprises, and train 1 million young people with knowledge. To everyone's delight, this goal was achieved two years ahead of schedule.

The Spark Program's banner proudly displays four characters: Science and Technology. Its mission is to deliver advanced, applicable technologies to rural areas, township enterprises, and small to medium-sized enterprises, thereby revitalizing local economies.

Initially, township enterprises emerged rapidly, bringing wealth to rural areas. However, they also exposed several issues due to a lack of technology, talent, and planning. People complained about township enterprises competing with large industries for resources, causing environmental pollution, and engaging in corrupt practices. Despite the fact that township enterprises have absorbed tens of millions of surplus rural labor and created much higher output values than agriculture, these issues have not been completely resolved. When the country proposed to rectify economic order, improve the economic environment, and adjust the industrial structure, many township enterprises once again found themselves in a passive situation. However, township enterprises included in the Spark Program presented a different picture. Due to careful project selection, thorough argumentation, full utilization of local resource advantages, and the establishment of market-oriented mechanisms and scientific management systems, Spark enterprises continued to thrive. Preliminary surveys from several provinces indicate that the vast majority of Spark enterprises meet the requirements of the national industrial policy.

In recent years, the Spark Program has developed over 100 sets of technologies suitable for township enterprises, covering industries such as food, machinery, chemicals, textiles, mining, electronics, and hardware. This has enabled some township enterprises to update their equipment, renovate their technologies, and even commercialize high and new technologies.

Relying on the pillar of science and technology, some Spark enterprises have begun to explore the path of industrial clusters and rural commodity production. They have produced well-known products both domestically and internationally, achieving good economic benefits. Examples include the Shangyu Windmill Factory in Zhejiang, the Huangshan Coca-Cola Development Group in Anhui, the Jiangsu Changzhou Chemical Group, the Fujian Mushroom Development Group, and the newly established pastoral cooperative in Qinghai. These innovative groups are indicative of the future development direction of the Spark Program.

Beijing has organized a team of professional and technical personnel, including equipment, process, quality engineers, accountants, and economists, to provide "diagnosis" and "prescriptions" for township enterprises, helping them truly rely on technological progress.

To deliver science and technology to rural areas, a carrier is needed. With a population of 1.1 billion, nearly a quarter are illiterate, and a large portion of these are farmers. Low cultural levels pose a fundamental obstacle to rural reliance on science and technology.

The Spark Program aims to cultivate and discover local talent and attract external talent. Over three years, it has trained 3.97 million technical and managerial personnel at different levels for rural areas. These talents have become the "spark" for rural reliance on technology, family prosperity, and wealth through labor.

More encouragingly, over three years, 470,000 scientific and technological personnel have entered the Spark Program, becoming the backbone force driving the program. Through various means such as paid technology transfer, paid technical services, and managing, leading, and leasing scientific and technological economic entities, Spark technology has been firmly rooted in the rural economy. These core personnel have "incubated" a large number of rural youth and grassroots cadres who have mastered Spark technology. In Hebei Province, 20,000 scientific and technological personnel, along with over 9,000 farmer technicians, have gone to rural areas to engage in technological contracting, establishing 1,765 multi-disciplinary, large-scale contractual organizations. They have formed an extensive network of scientific and technological services, both vertically and horizontally connected, and have promoted 2,590 scientific and technological achievements in 1988 alone.

Revitalizing the rural economy requires a significant amount of funding, which is self-evident. However, where will the funds come from? Relying on state investment? Obviously, this is difficult to achieve. At the beginning of the Spark Program's implementation, the shortage of funds often caused headaches. However, the Spark Program has reformed the method of relying on state investment, fully leveraging technological advantages to gradually attract a large amount of funding. Its high input-output ratio of 1:5 has gained the trust of financial and fiscal departments, securing financial support. Local governments are also vying to attract the Spark Program, with many places listing it as a key component of "scientific and technological development of the province." Statistics show that over three years, the total investment of the Spark Program has reached 8.4 billion yuan, with less than 10% coming from state investment, about 40% from financial and economic departments' loans, and over 50% from self-raised funds by units.

Officials from the World Bank, after multiple inspections of the Spark Program, have expressed their admiration and provided some financial support. The practice of the Spark Program has given us the following understanding: developing the rural economy requires investment (including both financial and technological investment), technological investment can attract financial investment, and make the invested funds achieve higher economic benefits.

　　星火科技　燎原神州
    本报记者  陈祖甲
    从１９８５年实施星火计划到现在，仅仅３年，它已经叫人刮目相看。星火科技的足迹遍布大陆３０个省、市、自治区的２０００多个县。
    国家科委最近公布统计数据，到１９８８年底，各地安排了国家、省、地、县级的星火计划项目１７３２２项，已经完成５１０６项，新增产值１１２亿元，创利税３６．２亿元。预计再过几年，这些项目全部完成，新增产值将超过４００亿元，每年创造利税８４亿元。这是一个不小的数目。
    当星火计划的帷幕拉开的时候，人们看到它的节目表上预告的目标是，到１９９０年，建立５００个星火示范企业，开发１００种适用于农村乡镇企业的成套技术装备，培训１００万知识青年。令人欣喜的是，这个目标已经提前两年完成。
    在星火计划的大旗上写着四个大字：科学技术。它的宗旨是向农村、向乡镇企业、向中小企业输送适用的先进技术，振兴地方经济。
    想当初，乡镇企业异军突起，给农村带来了财富。但同时也暴露了它由于缺乏技术、缺乏人才、缺乏计划引起的弊病。人们抱怨说，乡镇企业与大工业争原料、争能源，造成环境污染，乡镇企业搞不正之风等等。这些意见在乡镇企业消化了几千万农村剩余劳动力，创造出比农业多得多的产值的今天，仍然没有完全消弥。当我们国家提出整顿经济秩序、治理经济环境，调整产业结构的时候，不少乡镇企业又一次陷入被动的局面。列入星火计划的乡镇企业却是另一番景象。由于在立项时慎重选题，认真论证，充分利用当地资源优势，建立以市场为导向的机制和科学的管理制度，星火企业依然蓬勃发展。据几个省的初步调查，绝大多数的星火企业符合国家产业政策的要求。
    这几年，星火计划开发了１００多种适用于乡镇企业的技术装备，涉及食品、机械、化工、轻纺、采矿、电子、五金等众多行业。这使一些乡镇企业的装备得到更新，技术得到改造，有的使高技术、新技术实用化、商品化。
    依靠了科学技术这个支柱，一些星火企业开始探索产业集团和农村商品生产的路子，拿出在国内外打得响的拳头产品，创造了较好的经济效益。浙江上虞风机厂、安徽黄山可乐开发集团、江苏常州化工所为主的企业群体、福建省食用菌开发集团、青海新组建的牧业协会等都是围绕科技长入经济这一中心建立起来的技农贸、技工贸一体化经营的企业群体。其中的福建食用菌开发集团，范围涉及２８个县，干菇产量达到２万吨，产值６．４亿元。这些新颖群体预示着星火计划深入发展的方向。
    北京市还组织一批包括设备、工艺、质量工程师和会计师、经济师在内的专业技术人员，为乡镇企业“号脉”、“开处方”，使乡镇企业真正走上依靠科技进步的轨道。
    向农村输送科学技术需要载体。全国１１亿人口，近１／４是文盲，其中大部分是农民。文化水平低下使农村依靠科学技术遇到根本性的障碍。
    星火计划以培养、发掘当地人才和吸引外来人才为己任。３年中，分不同层次为农村培训了３９７万技术骨干和管理骨干。这些人才成为农村依靠科技，兴家立业，劳动致富的“火种”。
    更可喜的是，３年中有４７万科学技术人员进入星火阵地，成为推动星火计划的中坚力量。他们通过有偿转让成果，技术有偿服务，承办、领办、租赁科技经济实体等多种形式，使星火科技扎实地长入农村经济。这些骨干“孵化”出一大批掌握星火技术的农村知识青年和基层干部。河北省有２万名科技人员，同９０００多名农民技术员一起到农村进行技术承包，组建了１７６５个多学科、大范围的集团性承包组织，结成一个上下联结、纵横交错的科技服务网，仅１９８８年就推广了２５９０项科技成果。
    振兴农村经济需要大量资金的投入，这是不言而喻的。然而，资金从哪里来？靠国家投资吗？显然，这是难以办到的。星火计划实施之初，资金的短缺也常常叫人伤透脑筋。但是，星火计划改革靠国家投资的办法，充分发挥技术优势，逐渐吸引来大量资金。它的高达１∶５的投入产出比，得到金融、财政部门的信赖，取得资金上的支持。各地方政府也竞相争取星火计划，不少地方把星火计划列为“科技兴省”的重要内容。据统计，３年中星火计划的总投资达到８４亿元，其中国家投资不到１０％，另外的约４０％靠财经部门贷款，５０％以上是单位自筹资金。
    世界银行的官员在多次考察星火计划之后，表示赞赏，也给予一定的资金上的支持。星火计划的实践使我们得到了这样的认识：发展农村经济需要投入（包括资金和技术的投入），技术投入能够吸引资金的投入，使投入的资金获得更高的经济效益。
