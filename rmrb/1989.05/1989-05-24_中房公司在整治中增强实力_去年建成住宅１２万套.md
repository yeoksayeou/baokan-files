The largest real estate company in China, the China Real Estate Development Corporation, has strengthened its capabilities through rectification and deepening reform. Building on the 120,000 residential units completed last year, the company has taken new steps forward.

Implementing rectification and adjustment has led to a significant reduction in the overall scale of urban and rural construction, and the development speed and scale of commercial housing have also been affected to some extent. The China Real Estate Development Corporation believes that rectification and adjustment in the real estate industry are beneficial for promoting the elimination of the weak and the strong, and for encouraging enterprises to deepen their reforms.

They have conducted a comprehensive review of the companies under their jurisdiction, classifying and ranking them, and have set improvement deadlines for those with lower quality. For companies that genuinely lack development capabilities and have poor management, the corporation has terminated their affiliation with the headquarters.

At the same time, efforts have been made to improve operational management, perfect the contract system, and focus on planning and design, construction organization, sales operations, and after-sales service to enhance overall efficiency.

Recently, the China Real Estate Development Corporation has made plans and arrangements to establish the China Real Estate Development (Group) Corporation. This move aims to create economies of scale and serve the housing reform and modern urban construction.

　　中房公司在整治中增强实力
    去年建成住宅１２万套
    本报讯  记者于宁报道：我国最大的房地产公司中国房地产开发总公司在治理整顿、深化改革中加强自身建设，不断增强实力，在去年建成１２万套住宅的基础上，又迈出新步。
    实行治理整顿，城乡建设的总体规模有很大压缩，商品房开发的发展速度和规模也受到一定影响。中房公司认为，房地产行业进行治理整顿有利于扶优汰劣，促进企业深化改革。
    他们对各地公司登记复查，分类排队，对少数素质较低的公司限期提高，对个别确实没有开发实力、经营管理差的公司，解除了它们与总公司的隶属关系。
    与此同时，努力改善经营管理，完善承包制，抓好规划设计、施工组织、经营销售和售后服务四个环节，提高了综合效益。
    最近，中房公司又作出规划和部署，组建中国房地产开发（集团）总公司，以形成规模经济，为房改和现代化城市建设服务。
