We have become 'slaves of a dying factory'!"
"Our jobs have been smashed!"

On December 9, 1988, the collectively-owned small factory, Huainan Printing and Dyeing Factory II, merged with the state-owned Huainan Building Materials Machinery Factory. The 130 employees of the Building Materials Machinery Factory were terrified and worried. Some workers submitted transfer applications overnight, while more people adopted a wait-and-see attitude.

By 1988, the Building Materials Machinery Factory had accumulated debts of 23 million yuan and losses of nearly 10 million yuan. The factory had only 4.5 million yuan in fixed assets, making it insolvent. Paying workers' salaries relied entirely on selling off assets.

Zhang Wujin, the director of Printing and Dyeing Factory II, honestly told them: "After the merger, the original employees of both factories will have equal status, unchanged identities, and will receive the same pay for the same work, with distribution based on labor. As long as everyone works hard, I guarantee that everyone's treatment will improve and living conditions will be secured."

Zhang Wujin selected 26 employees from the original Building Materials Machinery Factory to work at the Printing and Dyeing Factory.

"This is splitting us up!" the transferred workers worried.

Zhang Wujin patiently explained: "After the merger, our two factories are one, we are family. Where workers are assigned to work is entirely based on the needs of the work."

However, two female workers caused a commotion and refused to go to work. Zhang Wujin decided: to withhold their monthly wages and labor protection supplies.

"That's too harsh! In state-owned enterprises, we might earn less, but we've never suffered like this!" the two female workers still grumbled.

Zhang Wujin replied bluntly: "This is a collective enterprise! If you want to get paid, you have to work!"

The two female workers had no choice but to go to work. It is worth mentioning that they did not fall behind in their work, and in the month they started, they each received an additional 20 yuan in bonuses.

Soon after, Zhang Wujin established a Casting Sub-factory in the original Building Materials Machinery Factory. Who would be appointed as the sub-factory director? The employees of the original Building Materials Machinery Factory speculated: "We have been merged by others, even if we have talented people, they won't be used." "The large factory will definitely send a director to control the sub-factory!"

The result was surprising: Wang Hao, an engineer from the original Building Materials Machinery Factory, was appointed as the sub-factory director, and Yan Genming, the deputy director of Printing and Dyeing Factory II, was appointed as the deputy sub-factory director.

Zhang Wujin said: "Whoever is skilled and has high technology, goes up! This is called equal competition!"

Not long after, an accident occurred at the Casting Sub-factory: a worker transferred from the original Printing and Dyeing Factory II, due to careless operation, damaged the crane equipment. Zhang Wujin did not protect him just because he was an old employee of the factory, and announced on the spot: suspension of duties for inspection, and a fine of 50 yuan.

The furnace workers of the merged factory had poor working conditions in the past, often getting burned hands and feet, and their clothes often getting burned. There were no labor protection benefits, and the workers complained bitterly. After the merger, Zhang Wujin organized efforts to improve the working environment of the furnace workers, and also promptly provided them with leather gloves, leather shoes, and specially made work clothes.

Soon, Zhang Wujin decided: to reduce the allowances and comprehensive bonuses of the cadres, to reduce the planned residential buildings and small cars of the original Printing and Dyeing Factory II, and to concentrate some funds to 'transfuse oxygen' to the Casting Sub-factory, to set up casting production lines. The entire factory's production quickly became lively.

　　 兼并以后   
     ——记淮南印染二厂厂长张五金
     汪家驷
    “我们成了‘亡厂奴’了！”
    “我们的饭碗被砸了！”
    １９８８年１２月９日集体所有制的百人小厂——淮南印染二厂兼并了国营淮南建材机械厂。建材机械厂１３０名职工惊恐、担忧。有的工人连夜递交了调动报告，更多的人则持观望态度。
    建材机械厂到１９８８年共欠债２３０万元，亏损近１００万元，而工厂仅有固定资产４５万元，已属资不抵债，给工人发工资全靠变卖资产。
    印染二厂厂长张五金坦诚相告：“兼并后，原两厂职工地位平等，身份不变，一律实行同工同酬，按劳分配。只要大家好好工作，我保证大家待遇有提高，生活有保障。”
    张五金从原建材机械厂抽调了２６名职工上印染厂劳动。
    “这不是分化我们吗？”被抽调来的工人忧心忡忡。
    张五金耐心解释：“兼并后，我们两厂合二为一，是一家人了，工人到哪里上岗，完全视工作需要而定。”
    但是，有两名女工吵吵闹闹，不愿上岗。张五金决定：扣发当月工资和劳保用品。
    “太狠了！在国营企业虽说拿钱少，但哪受过这份罪？”两名女工仍不服气。
    张五金回答干脆：“这是集体企业！想拿工资，就要干活！”
    这两名女工只好上岗了。值得一提的是，她俩干活不比别人落后，上岗当月除工资外，还各拿到２０元奖金。
    紧接着，张五金在原建材机械厂成立铸造分厂。选谁当分厂厂长呢？原建材机械厂职工猜测：“我们被人家兼并了，能人再多也不会重用。”“大厂肯定要派厂长来，控制分厂！”
    结果出人意料：原建材机械厂工程师王浩担任分厂厂长，印染二厂副厂长严根明担任分厂副厂长。
    张五金说：“谁业务棒、技术高，谁上！这叫平等竞争！”
    事隔不久，铸造分厂发生了一起责任事故：从原印染二厂调来的一位工人，因操作不慎，损坏了行车设备。张五金并未因他是老厂职工而袒护他，当众宣布：停职检查，罚款５０元。
    被兼并厂的炉前工，过去作业环境差，工人手脚常被烫伤，衣服常被烧烂，又无劳保福利，工人叫苦不迭。兼并后，张五金组织力量改造了炉前工作业环境外，还及时给炉前工配备了皮手套、皮鞋和特制工作服。
    不久，张五金决定：压缩干部津贴和综合奖金，压缩原印染二厂计划中的职工住宅楼和小汽车，集中一部分资金向铸造分厂“输血供氧”，上铸造生产线，全厂生产很快红火起来。
