The major theater and small troupe collaborate on new play
Beijing Opera "King of Huainan" Premieres in Beijing

The Beijing Opera "King of Huainan," which combines the mystical elements of Chinese mythology with the solemn atmosphere of historical events, vividly portrays the tragicomedy of the Western Han Dynasty's efforts to achieve political unification by eliminating the feudal lords Liu An and his Huainan kingdom. The opera premiered at the Beijing People's Theater last night and was warmly received by the audience. The play focuses on the character analysis of ancient Chinese intellectuals represented by Liu An, delving into the complex inner worlds of historical figures such as Liu An, Liu Che, Gongsun Hong, and Shen Qing. The hope is placed on the fictional character Zigu Princess, who, in pursuit of and defense of true human values, resolutely betrays the Han Emperor, who treated her like a sibling, and bravely steps out of her psychological dilemma.

The play is performed by the Huainan City Beijing Opera Troupe of Anhui Province, with the China Beijing Opera Theater providing assistance. Playwright Qi Zhixiang was invited to serve as the main director of the play. It is noted and appreciated that a central-level major theater can assist a local troupe in rehearsing new plays and playing supporting roles, which is rare and has a positive significance for revitalizing and promoting the development of Beijing Opera art.

　　大剧院小剧团联手攻新戏
    京剧《淮南王》在京公演
    本报北京５月２６日讯  “儒道之争，刀兵相向；一人得道，鸡犬升天”，寓空灵的神话传说于凝重的历史氛围，再现西汉王朝为谋求大一统政治而诛灭诸侯王刘安及其所统辖的淮南国的历史悲喜剧《淮南王》，今晚在首都人民剧场首演，受到观众的热烈欢迎。该剧在立意上侧重对以刘安为代表的中国古代知识分子群体人格进行剖析，着重揭示刘安、刘彻、公孙弘、审卿等众多历史人物复杂的内心世界，而将希望寄托于剧中唯一虚构的紫阁公主身上——为了追求和捍卫真正的人的价值，她义无反顾地背叛了待她如亲生兄妹的汉武帝，勇敢地走出了自己的心理怪圈。
    该剧由安徽省淮南市京剧团演出，中国京剧院协助演出。剧作家齐致翔应邀任这个戏的主要编导。人们注意到并赞赏：中央一级的大剧院能协助地方剧团排演新戏并充任配角实属难能可贵，对振兴和推动京剧艺术的发展有积极的意义。
