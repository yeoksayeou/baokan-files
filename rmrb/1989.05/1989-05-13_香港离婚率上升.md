Hong Kong's divorce rate is on the rise. Last year, there were 5,098 divorce cases, more than five times the number of the previous year.

According to a survey by the Hong Kong Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, most divorce cases involve couples aged between 30 and 40.

While the divorce rate is increasing, there is a lack of institutions dedicated to marriage mediation. So far, the only such institution is the Hong Kong Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, established in 1987. The number of people seeking help is also low. The council appeals to society to pay more attention to marriage mediation services, as many couples facing marital breakdown do not know how to handle legal issues.

　　香港离婚率上升
    新华社香港５月１２日电  香港离婚率不断上升，去年发生离婚案５０９８宗，比前年上升５倍以上。
    据香港公教婚姻辅导会调查，香港离婚案以３０至４０岁的夫妇居多。
    香港离婚率上升，但专门协助婚姻调解的机构非常缺乏，至今只有１９８７年成立的香港公教婚姻辅导会，求助的人士也不多。该会呼吁社会应该重视婚姻调解服务，因为不少面临婚姻破裂的夫妇都不知如何处理法律问题。
