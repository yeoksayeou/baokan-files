Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 28th.

China's team stumbled, and the host nation kept its promise. The Indonesian badminton team won the Sudirman Cup.

The Indonesian team fulfilled its vow not to let the first Sudirman Cup fall into someone else's hands. After a grueling 5-hour and 10-minute match, they overcame a two-game deficit to defeat South Korea, securing the world mixed team badminton championship.

South Korea took second place, while China and Denmark tied for third.

Young star Wang Lianxiang became the hero of the night, earning the admiration of the ecstatic local spectators.

Wang Lianxiang took the court third for Indonesia after the men's and women's doubles teams had both lost. Her opponent was the world-renowned player Lee Young-sook. In the first set, Lee used her agile footwork and powerful backcourt smashes to take a 12-10 lead. However, in the second set, Wang, with her solid fundamentals, engaged in a "mushroom" battle with Lee. Exhausted from the previous night's match against China, Lee watched as Wang slowly closed the gap. Leading 10-7, Lee was overtaken by Wang, who won 12-10. In the third set, Wang grew stronger while Lee faltered, ultimately losing 0-15. Indonesia saw a glimmer of hope.

Later, Ro Tienning capitalized on his net play advantage, quickly defeating Chung Han-guk with scores of 15-4 and 15-3.

The decisive fifth match featured Indonesia's Hong Chiong-Min and Verawati against South Korea's Park Joo-bong and Jeong Myung-hee. In the first set, the South Korean pair led 13-12, but the Indonesian players, buoyed by their compatriots' cheers, scored six consecutive points to win. In the second set, the Indonesians continued their momentum, winning 15-3. The 32-year-old veteran Verawati knelt on the court, tears of joy streaming down her face.

South Korea's Park Joo-bong and Kim Won-fu, and Hwang Hye-young and Jeong Soo-young won the first two matches against Indonesia's Hong Chiong-Min and Kwee Hong Choon, and Verawati and Xu Zhanli.

Tomorrow, the sixth World Badminton Championships will commence here.

　　中国队马失前蹄　东道主如愿以偿
    印尼羽毛球队获苏迪曼杯
    新华社雅加达５月２８日电  （记者梁金雄周宗欣）东道主印度尼西亚队“不让首届苏迪曼杯落入他人之手”的诺言今晚在这里得到了应验。
    印尼队在长达５小时１０分钟的较量中，在先失两场的劣势下，连扳３场，击败南朝鲜队，捧走了世界羽毛球混合团体赛冠军杯。
    南朝鲜队名列第二，中国队和丹麦队并列第三。
    为印尼队赢来胜机的小将王莲香，今晚成为欢喜若狂的当地观众所敬佩的英雄。
    王莲香是在印尼队男双和女双先后失利的情况下第三个出场的，她的对手是世界羽坛名将李英淑。首局，李英淑以灵活的步法和大力的后场劈杀以１２∶１０先拿一分。但在第二局比赛中，王莲香以其扎实的基本功，与对手展开“蘑菇”战。李英淑因昨晚与中国队比赛时消耗了大量体力，眼看着王莲香一分分地追上来，在１０∶７领先的局势下，反被对手以１２∶１０取胜。第三局，王莲香越战越勇，而李英淑力不从心，操之过急，结果又吃了个“零蛋”。印尼队从此出现了胜利的曙光。
    尔后，罗天宁在同成汉国的比赛中，充分发挥出网前球好的特长，很快便以１５∶４、１５∶３连胜两局。
    决定胜负的第五场比赛由印尼的洪忠中／维拉华蒂对南朝鲜的朴柱奉／郑明熙。首局比赛，南朝鲜选手曾以１３∶１２领先，但印尼选手在同胞的呐喊助威声中，连得６分获胜。第二局印尼选手势如破竹，以１５∶３获胜。３２岁的老将维拉华蒂激动地跪在球场，流下了热泪。
    南朝鲜的朴柱奉／金文秀和黄惠英／郑素英在头两场比赛中分别战胜了印尼的洪忠中／郭宏源和维拉华蒂／许钻丽。
    明天，第六届世界羽毛球锦标赛将在这里揭幕。
