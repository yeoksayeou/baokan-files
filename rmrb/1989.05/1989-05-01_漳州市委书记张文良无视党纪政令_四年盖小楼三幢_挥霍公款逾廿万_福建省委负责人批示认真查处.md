In Zhangzhou, Fujian Province, many cadres have reported to reporters that Zhang Wenliang, Secretary of the Zhangzhou Municipal Party Committee, has squandered over 200,000 yuan of state funds in four years to build three new houses for himself. At the beginning of this year, he moved into a newly constructed villa-style house, ignoring the central government's call for clean governance. Reporters have sent a report to the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, and Secretary Chen Guangyi has promptly instructed that the matter be thoroughly investigated and handled.

Zhang Wenliang's new residence was built in the latter half of 1988, during a nationwide campaign to cut back on construction investments, using more than 100,000 yuan of state funds. However, its construction was not discussed at a meeting of the Municipal Party Committee's Standing Committee, and even the Mayor and Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, Han Yulin, was unaware of it. This villa was directly supervised by a deputy secretary of the municipal government, who organized the design and construction. After discovering the construction, Han Yulin proposed an immediate halt, but Zhang Wenliang not only did not stop the construction but also raised the construction standards. The original design was for a two-story building with two units, each with nearly 150 square meters of living space, polished concrete floors, tiled kitchens, iron railings, and windows with screens. The exterior had walls surrounding it, and the roof had a terrace, railing, and a storage room. This already exceeded the State Council's regulation that "the living space for department-level cadres should be controlled between 80 and 90 square meters." Zhang Wenliang also violated the central government's regulation that "high-level cadres are strictly prohibited from using their authority to utilize state resources and manpower to build individual residences for themselves," ordering the demolition of the already laid foundation and rebuilding it into a villa-style house with a single entrance and courtyard, locally known as the "Secretary's House." The kitchen and bathroom were also demolished and rebuilt. Even after the State Council issued the order to halt the construction of buildings, Zhang Wenliang did not "enforce the order," but instead visited the construction site several times to urge the construction team to continue working.

Zhang Wenliang's move to the new residence was not due to the old house being uninhabitable. He lived in the former residence of the Regional Party Committee Secretary, which was quiet, spacious, and fully equipped. Before moving, he spent several thousand yuan of public funds for a complete renovation and then installed air conditioning. However, he was still not satisfied and pursued a higher-level villa-style house.

This desire had been expressed by Zhang Wenliang earlier. In the spring of 1985, during his first month in office, he moved from the original Municipal Science and Technology Commission to the residence of a former deputy secretary of the Regional Party Committee. This was a two-unit building, with each unit having four rooms and two halls. However, he only lived there for half a year before instructing the Municipal Office Management Bureau to build a villa-style new house for him. In the autumn of 1985, the Municipal Office Management Bureau spent 400,000 yuan to build a single-entry courtyard house for him, with a building area of 130 square meters. Later, he used the excuse of choosing a new location to build another house. In the latter half of 1986, in the newly selected Xiangjiang New Village, he spent more than 800,000 yuan to build another villa-style house, with two units, each with 140 square meters. He originally planned to live in one unit and the mayor in the other, but the mayor refused to move in, and there were also discussions among the old cadres. He had no choice but to give it to the Chairman of the Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee and the Chairman of the Municipal Political Consultative Conference to live in, and then started planning to build this single-entry courtyard villa-style "Secretary's House" in the Municipal Party Committee compound.

Cadres in Zhangzhou expressed their indignation, saying: "Zhang Wenliang's family of four has moved into a new residence with nearly 150 square meters of space, which is a single-entry courtyard villa-style house, far exceeding the national standards for cadre housing and the living space of previous Zhangzhou Regional Party Committee Secretaries." They criticized, "Zhang Wenliang does not care about the nationwide reduction in construction investments, does not care about Zhangzhou's annual fiscal deficits, and does not care about the long-term housing shortages of nearly 10,000 teachers, cadres, and residents in the city, only seeking personal enjoyment."

### 漳州市委书记张文良无视党纪政令  四年盖小楼三幢　挥霍公款逾廿万  福建省委负责人批示认真查处

　　漳州市委书记张文良无视党纪政令    
    四年盖小楼三幢　挥霍公款逾廿万    
    福建省委负责人批示认真查处
    本报讯  记者张安南、卢继传报道：在福建漳州市，不少干部向记者反映：漳州市委书记张文良，任职４年，挥霍国家２０多万元，先后为自己建造３幢新楼。今年初，他无视中央为政要清廉的要求，搬进了去年岁末为他建成的一幢别墅式小楼。记者就此给中共福建省委写了情况反映，省委书记陈光毅同志迅即批示要认真查处。
    张文良的新居，建于１９８８年下半年全国压缩基建投资之际，动用了国家资金１０万多元。但它的兴建，竟没有拿到市委常委会议一议，连市长兼市委副书记韩玉琳都不知道。这幢小楼是张文良直接指挥市政府一位副秘书长组织设计施工的。韩玉琳发现后，提出立即停建。张文良不仅不停建，还提高建筑标准。原设计为一幢可住２户的２层楼，每户住房面积近１５０平方米，室内水磨地板、瓷砖厨房、铁栏纱窗，室外四周围墙，屋顶还建有凉台、围栏和储藏室。这已经不符合国务院关于“厅局级干部住房标准控制在８０—９０平方米”的规定，张文良又违反中央关于“严禁高级干部利用职权动用国家物资、人力为个人建造单户住宅”的规定，下令挖掉已打好的地基，重新改建成单门独院的别墅式小楼，当地称作“书记楼”。厨房、卫生间也都推倒重建。即使在国务院下达了楼堂馆所停建令之后，张文良也没有“令行禁止”，反而几次到工地，督促施工队施工。
    张文良建迁新居，并非旧宅不堪久留。他住的是原地委书记的楼房，环境幽静，居室宽敞，设备齐全。迁住之前，又花公款几千元进行全面装修，随后又装上空调。但是，他还不满足，追求更高级的别墅式小楼。
    这种欲望，张文良早就有所流露。１９８５年春，他上任第一个月，就从原市科委搬进原地委一位副书记的住房。这是一幢只住２户的楼房，每户４房２厅。可他仅仅住了半年，便授意市机关管理局为他专门兴建别墅式的新楼。１９８５年秋，市机关管理局花费４万元，为他盖了一幢单门独院的小楼，建筑面积为１３０平方米。后来，他又借口另选址盖楼。１９８６年下半年，在他选定的芗江新村，耗资８万多元，建起了一幢别墅式小楼，共两套住房，每套１４０平方米。他原想和市长各住一套，但市长拒绝迁住，同时老干部也有议论。他迫不得已把它转给市人大常委会主任和市政协主席居住，自己又着手筹划在市委大院兴建他新迁居的这幢单门独院别墅式“书记楼”。
    漳州市干部愤愤不平地说：张文良一家仅４口人，搬入的新居，拥有近１５０平方米面积，又是单门独院别墅式的，大大超过了国家规定的干部住房的规格和标准，超过了历任漳州地委书记住房面积。他们批评“张文良不顾全国压缩基建投资，不顾漳州年年财政赤字，不顾全市近万户教师、干部和居民长期缺房之苦，只图个人享受。”
