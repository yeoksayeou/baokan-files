The State Forest Fire Prevention Headquarters issued an urgent telegram on May 24, requiring all regions to continue their efforts and see the spring forest fire prevention work through to the end.

The notice stated that this year's spring prevention work, under the direct leadership of the State Council and local governments at all levels, was well-deployed and tightly managed. Various sectors of society and departments worked together to overcome the adverse weather conditions of high temperatures and drought since the beginning of spring. Significant achievements have been made. Except for a few regions in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Southwest China, the spring prevention period in other provinces and autonomous regions has basically ended. As of now, the number of forest fires and the resulting losses nationwide have significantly decreased compared to the same period last year. However, the progress in different regions is uneven, with some provinces and autonomous regions experiencing an increase compared to last year.

To ensure the spring prevention work is completed thoroughly, the notice put forward three specific requirements: First, the critical period for spring prevention in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Southwest China has not yet passed, and there must be no complacency or relaxation in either thought or action. In the next half month, all levels of command personnel and fire prevention and firefighting forces must remain at their posts, strengthen command and dispatch, timely grasp the work and fire situation, and do a good job in coordination, service, and command. Second, in places where the spring prevention period has ended, a comprehensive summary of the spring prevention work must be conducted promptly, especially focusing on summarizing the measures and methods that have made breakthroughs in prevention work. Through summarizing experiences and lessons, specific measures for improving work should be proposed. Third, all regions must seriously investigate and deal with forest fires that occurred during the spring prevention period. Each fire incident must have a conclusion and accountability, and responsible parties and perpetrators must be seriously dealt with.

　　国家森林防火总指挥部发出紧急通知
    春季森林防火丝毫不得松懈
    本报北京５月２７日讯  国家森林防火总指挥部５月２４日发出紧急电报通知，要求各地再接再厉、善始善终搞好今年春季森林防火工作。
    通知说，今年的春防工作在国务院和地方各级人民政府的直接领导下，部署早，抓得紧，社会各方面各部门通力协作，克服了入春以来气温偏高、少雨干旱的不利气候条件，取得了较好的成绩。除东北、内蒙古和西南少数地区外，其他省、区春防期已基本结束。截至目前统计，全国森林火灾次数和损失比去年同期有较大幅度的下降，但各地发展不够平衡，有的省、区比去年有所增加。
    为了善始善终地搞好今年春防工作，通知提出三项具体要求：一是东北、内蒙古及西南地区的春防紧要时期还没有过去，思想上工作上都不能有丝毫麻痹和松懈。在今后半个多月时间里，各级指挥人员和各方面防火扑火力量，一定要坚守工作岗位，加强值班调度，及时掌握工作和火情动态，做好协调、服务和指挥工作。二是春防期已经结束的地方，要抓紧对春防工作进行全面总结，特别要注意总结预防工作有所突破的措施和办法，通过总结经验教训，提出对改进工作的具体措施。三是各地对今年春防期间发生的森林火灾，要认真查处，每起火灾都要有个结果和交代，对责任者和肇事者作出严肃处理。
