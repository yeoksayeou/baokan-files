More than 700 students from Chung Yuan University held a large-scale march in the Zhongli District yesterday morning. They submitted a protest letter to the Zhongli Police Station regarding the murder of graduate student Lan Zhongyi by a thug. The students demanded that the police apprehend the culprit and eliminate the gambling-related electronic game businesses in the campus area.

Lan Zhongyi was a graduate student in the Chemical Engineering Department at Chung Yuan University. On April 28, he was found with blunt force injuries and lying naked in the bushes near the campus. Despite emergency medical treatment, he died on May 8.

After Lan Zhongyi's death, more than 20 student organizations at Chung Yuan University launched the "University City Purification Action." During yesterday's march, students held up banners reading "Apprehend the Killer," "Police Inaction, Student Dissatisfaction," "Resignations of Officials," and "Electronic Games Out." They protested to the Zhongli Police Chief about certain corrupt police officers protecting electronic game shops and the police's failure to maintain campus security. The protest ended after the relevant authorities promised to "shut down all electronic game shops near the campus within a week."

　　就一研究生遇害事    
    台学生向警方抗议
    新华社香港５月１２日电  据台湾报纸报道，台湾中原大学７００多名学生昨天上午在中坜市区举行大规模游行，并就该校研究生蓝仲诒遭暴徒击毙一事，向中坜市警察局递交抗议书，请求缉凶及扫除校园里赌博性的电动玩具业。
    蓝仲诒是中原大学化工研究所研究生，他在４月２８日被发现遭钝器击伤，赤身躺在校园附近的草丛内，经医院急救无效于５月８日死亡。
    中原大学２０多个学生团体在蓝仲诒去世后发起“大学城净化行动”。在昨天的游行中，学生们高举“缉凶归案”、“警察不管，学生不满”、“主管下台”、“赌博电玩滚蛋”等抗议布条，向中坜市警察局长抗议部分不法警员包庇电动玩具店，对维护校园治安不力等等。在有关主管允诺“一星期内取缔干净校园附近的电动玩具店”之后结束。
