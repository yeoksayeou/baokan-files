Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 20th.

The spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal People's Government today answered questions from reporters regarding the deployment of part of the People's Liberation Army to assist in the implementation of martial law in the capital.

Q: Why is the military being deployed to Beijing?

A: Everyone knows that in recent days, the state of anarchy in Beijing has become increasingly severe. This situation has seriously affected the production, work, study, and daily life of the entire city's population. Various social elements have also flooded into Beijing, and social order is deteriorating. Beijing is the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, as well as many foreign diplomatic missions. The original public security police and armed police forces in Beijing were configured based on normal circumstances. In the current special situation, it is impossible for them to undertake the task of maintaining order in the capital. In accordance with the need to implement the martial law order issued by the State Council for certain areas of Beijing, and with the approval of the Central Military Commission, some troops from outside the city have been deployed into Beijing to assist the public security police and armed police forces in implementing martial law.

Q: What tasks will the troops deployed to Beijing undertake?

A: This issue was already addressed by Comrade Yang Shangkun at the meeting of the Party, government, and military cadres in the capital yesterday. In summary, the tasks of the troops are as follows: First, to maintain order in the capital and ensure that the people of the entire city can carry out production, work, study, and daily life normally. Second, to ensure the normal operation of the central and Beijing municipal Party and government leadership organs. Third, to ensure the safety of important departments and units. Fourth, to protect public property from being infringed upon and to safeguard the personal safety and property of citizens.

Q: Does the entry of the military into Beijing mean that students will be suppressed?

A: In the current situation of severe social disorder, there are many rumors circulating in society, one of which is that "the military entering Beijing is to suppress students." This is entirely groundless. The People's Liberation Army is the army of the people, and they are here to protect the country and the people. Their entry into Beijing is not directed against students, let alone to "suppress students."

Q: Will there be military control over universities?

A: In accordance with the requirements of the martial law order, some troops may perform tasks around schools. This is to assist the public security police and armed police in maintaining normal order around the schools, ensuring that teachers and students can carry out their work and studies normally, and protecting the safety of teachers and students. There is absolutely no task of military control.

　　就调入部分解放军参加执行首都戒严任务
    北京市政府发言人答记者问
    新华社北京５月２０日电  北京市人民政府发言人今天就调入部分人民解放军参加执行首都戒严任务一事，回答了记者提出的问题。
    问：为什么要调军队到北京来？
    答：大家知道，近几天北京市的无政府状态越来越严重。这种状况已经严重影响了全市人民的生产、工作、学习和生活秩序。各种社会闲杂人员也涌入北京，社会治安日趋恶化。北京是党中央、国务院所在地，还有许多外国驻华机构。北京市原有的公安干警和武装警察队伍是根据正常形势的需要配备的。在当前的特殊情况下，由他们担负维护首都秩序的任务已不可能。根据执行国务院发布的北京市部分地区戒严令的需要，经中央军委批准，从外地调一些部队进入北京市，协助北京市的公安干警和武警部队执行戒严任务。
    问：调进北京市的部队担负哪些任务？
    答：关于这个问题，昨天杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上已经讲了。概括来说，部队的任务有四项：第一，维护首都秩序，保障全市人民能够正常地进行生产、工作、学习和生活。第二，保障中央和北京市党政领导机关的正常工作。第三，保障重要部门和单位的安全。第四，保障公共财产不受侵犯和公民个人的生命财产安全。
    问：军队进入北京，是否意味着要镇压学生？
    答：在当前社会秩序严重混乱的情况下，社会上谣言很多，其中之一就是“军队进入北京是镇压学生的”。这是毫无根据的。人民解放军是人民的子弟兵，他们是保卫国家和人民的。他们进入北京，决不是对付学生的，更谈不上“镇压学生”。
    问：对高等学校是否要进行军管？
    答：根据戒严令的要求，有些部队可能会在学校周围执行任务，这是为了协助本市公安干警和武装警察维护学校周围的正常秩序，保证学校师生员工能够进行正常的工作、学习和生活，保护师生员工的生命财产安全，根本没有军管的任务。
