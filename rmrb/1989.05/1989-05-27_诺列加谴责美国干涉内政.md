Panamanian Defense Forces Commander Noriega accused the United States on May 26 of orchestrating and directly intervening in the current crisis in Panama.

Noriega made the remarks at a press conference after the second meeting with a delegation from the Organization of American States (OAS) that came to mediate the crisis.

Noriega said that the Panamanian military had provided the delegation with sufficient evidence of U.S. interference in Panama's internal affairs.

The delegation, consisting of the OAS Secretary-General and foreign ministers from three Latin American countries, arrived in Panama on May 23. According to the resolution of the 21st OAS Council of Foreign Ministers, the delegation is mediating between the Panamanian government and the opposition to seek a democratic and consultative solution to the crisis.

On May 7, Panama held a general election. When the results favored the opposition presidential candidate, the Panamanian government declared the election invalid, sparking strong dissatisfaction among the domestic opposition backed by the United States. The OAS decided to intervene in the mediation. The situation in Panama remains tense.

　　诺列加谴责美国干涉内政
    新华社巴拿马城５月２６日电  巴拿马国防军司令诺列加２６日指出，巴拿马目前的危机完全是美国幕后操纵和直接插手造成的。
    诺列加是在第２次会晤前来调解危机的美洲国家组织代表团后在记者招待会上发表上述谈话的。
    诺列加说，巴拿马军方已向代表团提供了表明美国干涉巴拿马内政的充足证据。
    由美洲国家组织秘书长和拉美３国外长组成的代表团５月２３日抵达巴拿马。根据该组织第２１次外长会议决议，代表团正在巴拿马政府和反对党之间进行斡旋，以寻求用民主协商的方式来解决这场危机。
    ５月７日，巴拿马举行大选。在选举结果有利于反对党总统候选人的情况下，巴拿马政府宣布大选无效，引起得到美国支持的国内反对派的强烈不满。美洲国家组织决定从中调解。目前，巴局势仍较紧张。
