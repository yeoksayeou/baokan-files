**From the column: "Poisonous Remnants"**

Superstition is rampant in our area. On March 29th, our township organized a procession to escort the "spirit medium" Qiu. Over 7,000 people participated, forming lines six to seven people wide that stretched for 2 kilometers. There were over 500 colorful banners and 400 firecracker guns. Twenty palanquins carried the gods, and there were numerous altars. From 5 AM to 10 PM, these people paraded and worshipped for 17 hours, passing through two townships and 32 villages, covering over 50 kilometers. The procession included elderly people, young adults, and even students who skipped school. There were also Communist Youth League members, Party members, and even retired village cadres.

Nowadays, worshipping gods is openly tolerated in every sector. Farmers can halt spring plowing, schools can delay classes, and firecracker factories can provide each worker with a thousand firecrackers.

Even in daily life, there are many people who use superstition to swindle money. In the countryside, there are even more people who make a side income from performing as gods and spirits.

　　拜倒在神灵脚下的大瑶
    我们这里迷信活动越搞越盛。３月２９日，我乡接送邱仙姑的迷信活动，参加的人达７０００多，六七人一排的队伍长达２公里长，彩色大旗５００多面，四眼铳４００多把，香案、神轿２０抬。从清晨５点到晚上１０点，这些人游行祭祀１７小时，经过两个乡３２个村，行程５０多公里。队伍中，有老人，有青年，也有旷课的小学生；有团员，有党员，还有退休的村干部。现在，我们这里祭祀神灵，各行各业都大开“绿灯”。农民可以中止春耕，学校可以推迟上课，花炮厂可以供给每个职工一千红炮。
    平时，我们这里以迷信手段来骗取钱财的人也不少，乡间以装神弄鬼为副业者则更多。
