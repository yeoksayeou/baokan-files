Recently, students from some universities in Beijing have been sitting and fasting in Tiananmen Square, demanding a dialogue with the Party Central Committee and the State Council leaders. Now, the dialogue between the Party Central Committee and the State Council leaders and the students has begun and will continue through multiple levels and channels. The reasonable opinions and demands raised by the broad masses of young students are being studied by the Party and the government, which are taking concrete measures and steps to address them. In late June, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will include several hot issues of public concern in its main agenda, aiming to solve problems through strengthening democracy and the rule of law. All of this requires a stable situation. What is most needed now is calmness, rationality, restraint, and order.

Currently, the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union has begun. This is a significant event that has attracted global attention. The success of the meeting is in the interests of the peoples of both China and the Soviet Union and is also conducive to world peace and stability. We hope that the students will consider the bigger picture and avoid doing anything that may damage the dignity and interests of the state.

Now, due to the prolonged fasting and the cool night temperatures, some students have fallen ill. The Party Central Committee and the State Council leaders are deeply concerned about this and hope that the students will return to their schools as soon as possible. We also hope that school leaders, teachers, and parents will do their part in persuading the students to return to school.

Achieving the Four Modernizations and revitalizing the Chinese nation is our common goal. Let us work together to promote reform and opening up, to carry out rectification, to strengthen anti-corruption efforts, to advance economic and political system reforms, and to strive for the modernization of our country.

　　对聚集在天安门广场高校学生    
    中办国办发表广播讲话    
    希望同学们尽快返回学校
    新华社北京５月１６日凌晨１时电  中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅在５月１５日午夜对聚集在天安门广场同学们的广播讲话，全文如下：
    近日来，北京一些高等学校的同学在天安门广场静坐绝食，要求与党中央、国务院领导同志对话，现在，党中央和国务院领导同志与同学们的对话已经开始，还将多层次、多渠道继续进行。广大青年学生提出的合理意见和要求，党和政府正在研究，采取切实措施和步骤加以解决。６月下旬，全国人大常委会议将把群众关心的若干热点问题列入主要议程，通过加强民主和法制建设解决问题。这些都需要有一个稳定的局面。现在最需要的是冷静、理智、克制、秩序。
    当前，中苏高级会晤已经开始。这是举世瞩目的大事。会晤的成功符合中苏两国人民的利益，也有利于世界的和平和稳定。希望同学们以大局为重，不要做有损于国家尊严和利益的事情。
    现在，由于同学们静坐绝食时间较长，夜间气候较凉，有的同学已出现病情。党中央、国务院领导同志对此十分关切，希望同学们尽快返回学校。我们也希望学校领导、老师、家长做好劝说工作，动员同学们回校。
    实现四化、振兴中华，是我们的共同目标。让我们同心同德搞好改革开放，搞好治理整顿，加强廉政建设，推进经济体制改革和政治体制改革，为加速我国的现代化建设而奋斗。
