World Bank's Chief Representative in China, Dr. Lin Zhongeng, stated: The efficiency of an enterprise primarily depends on competition. With competition, efficiency can be improved. A state-owned enterprise, if it is in a highly competitive environment, can also achieve high efficiency. A private enterprise, if it holds a monopolistic position, its efficiency will be very low. Therefore, enterprise reform is mainly about strengthening competition and fully utilizing the market mechanism, rather than the issue of public ownership versus private ownership. He also believes that the contract responsibility system is at most a transitional measure. In the short term, it can adapt to China's actual situation and also improve the enthusiasm of enterprise managers and workers. However, in the long run, it is not advisable. It is necessary to transition to methods that can fundamentally solve the problem of enterprise behavior, including shareholding, where shareholders can be individuals, collectives, local governments, institutions, etc.

　　林重庚谈：
  　企业效率主要取决于竞争
    世界银行驻中国首席代表林重庚博士说：企业的效率主要取决于竞争，有竞争就可以提高效率，一个公有制企业，如果是在一种激烈竞争的情况下，它也会达到高效率；一个私有企业，如果处于垄断地位，它的效率也会很低。因此企业改革主要是加强竞争和充分利用市场机制，而不是公有制与私有制的问题。他还认为，承包责任制最多只是一个过渡的办法，在短期内可适应中国的实际情况，也能提高企业经理和工人的积极性。但从长远来说是不可取的，应尽快过渡到能够根本解决企业行为问题的方法，包括股份制在内，股份持有者可以是个人、集体、地方政府、机构等。
