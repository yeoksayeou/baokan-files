New Anti-Theft Measures

Opening a door or a safe can be done without a key by using fingerprints. This is a device that utilizes a microcomputer: first, the fingerprints of relevant personnel are input, and when opening, simply press the index finger lightly, and the computer will quickly scan. After the fingerprint is confirmed, the door will automatically open. This device is called a fingerprint scanner (see the above image). It is both convenient and secure. Ordinary locks can be broken, and keys can be duplicated, but fingerprints are difficult to forge. Using fingerprints to open doors also eliminates the trouble of forgetting to bring a key.

In addition to using fingerprints, there are other biological security systems that utilize computers. For example, the eye scanner, which uses a low-intensity infrared beam to pass through the pupil into the eye, and after two seconds, the retinal type is matched with the type stored in the computer, immediately producing the effect of opening. When using a voice detection device, a person's voice pattern will appear on the device. Since this device identifies the physiological characteristics of a person speaking, and not just the voice or pronunciation, even if someone has a severe cold, it will not affect the image.

Currently, there are more than 20 small companies in the United States producing such devices. The buyers are generally the military, nuclear power plants, laboratories, and banks. Some wealthy individuals in Japan have also installed such devices for safety reasons.

Biological security systems are expensive, with each unit costing around $3,000, making them difficult to popularize. A factory in Denver, USA, plans to release a voice-checking device priced at $300 next year. It is expected that in a few years, biological detection devices will appear on bank counters to prevent someone from fraudulently withdrawing deposits.

　　防盗有新招
    开启房门或保险柜，可以不用钥匙而用指纹，这是一种应用了微电脑的装置：事先将有关人员的指纹输入，开启时只要将食指轻轻按下，电脑就会迅速扫描，指纹被确认后，门即自动打开。这种装置叫指纹扫描仪（见上图）。它既简便又安全。一般的门锁能被砸坏，钥匙可以配制，而指纹却难以仿制。用指纹开门也免除了忘记带钥匙的烦恼。
    除采用指纹外，还有其它借助电脑的生物安全系统。如眼扫描仪，它是让一种低强度的红外线穿过瞳孔，射入眼内，两秒钟后视网膜类型即与电脑内事先储存的类型相核对，随即产生开启的效果。使用声音检测仪时，仪器上会出现人的声束数据图。由于这种仪器是辨认人说话时的生理特征，而不仅是声音或发音，所以即便是患重感冒也不会破坏图像。
    现在，美国有２０多家小公司生产这类仪器。买主一般为军队、核电站、实验室和银行。日本一些豪富为安全起见也安装了这种仪器。
    生物安全系统的价格昂贵，每台约３０００美元，难以推广。美国丹佛一家工厂打算在明年推出３００美元一台的声检仪。预计，几年后生物检测仪器将出现在银行的柜台上，以防有人冒领存款。
