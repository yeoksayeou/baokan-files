Over the past ten days, the issue of land-based short-range nuclear weapons has become a focal point of intense debate within NATO countries. On April 27, West German Chancellor Kohl formally proposed in the Bundestag that the United States should expedite negotiations with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles and nuclear artillery. The United States was displeased with West Germany's move and repeatedly reaffirmed its opposition to such negotiations, stating that under conditions where the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces still hold an advantage, short-range missiles cannot be used as bargaining chips. After the debate became public, Britain supported the U.S. position, while more NATO countries endorsed West Germany's stance. The arguments can be summarized as follows: one side believes that negotiations are a "dangerous trap" that will cause NATO to lose its nuclear deterrent, thereby exposing NATO to the threat of the Warsaw Pact's superior conventional forces. The other side argues that negotiations can lead to a reduction in nuclear armaments and achieve greater security.

This debate has deep-rooted causes. In Europe, land-based nuclear weapons, excluding nuclear artillery and others, are mainly short-range nuclear missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometers. Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, which are in a state of confrontation, possess different quantities of such weapons. After the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in December 1987 to eliminate medium-range and short-range missiles, short-range missiles became a prominent issue in European nuclear weapons. The Soviet Union advocated for negotiations to resolve the short-range missile issue, but opinions within NATO were divided. However, due to various factors, NATO's stance at the time was: given the imbalance in conventional forces between East and West, it insisted on its traditional "flexible response" strategy, using nuclear weapons as a deterrent against conventional force attacks, and was unwilling to engage in short-range missile negotiations. At the same time, to maintain the effectiveness of this strategy, it was decided in principle to update existing short-range missiles. However, in recent years, the situation in Europe has undergone new changes, especially when Gorbachev proposed unilateral reductions in conventional forces stationed in Europe last December, followed by suggestions for significant reductions in conventional forces, providing new opportunities for European military détente. Therefore, when the Bush administration took office and the new Secretary of State Baker visited NATO countries, whether NATO should update short-range missiles and whether it should negotiate with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles became the central topics of discussion. The Bush administration, facing the mood in Western Europe, made some adjustments, agreeing to postpone the decision on updating short-range missiles until after the West German elections in 1990, but still insisted that short-range missiles should not be negotiated.

In this debate, West Germany is at the forefront, and there are reasons for this. From the perspective of West German domestic politics, the West German public has always been sensitive to nuclear weapons deployed on West German soil, as the use of such weapons would directly affect West Germany. Therefore, all political parties advocate for negotiations to reduce or even eliminate short-range missiles. West Germany will hold elections at the end of 1990, and the government cannot avoid taking a stand on this issue. However, this debate is not just between the United States and West Germany; many NATO countries are also involved. The reason is that there are differing views within NATO on the current situation in Europe. Some countries believe that Europe has new opportunities for disarmament, and NATO should not miss this opportunity, while some countries, especially the United States, hope to be more cautious, believing that short-range missiles are still a means of balancing military power under conditions where the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces hold an advantage. At the same time, they are concerned that negotiations may lead to pressure to eliminate short-range missiles. However, the U.S. government's stance has drawn criticism in Washington. Some critics believe that the Bush administration is overly cautious and lacks boldness.

From May 29 to 30, the 16 NATO member countries will hold a summit in Brussels. It is generally believed that if this current debate is not resolved, it will not only have adverse effects on NATO's unity but will also impact NATO's future strategy and negotiation policies.

### 围绕短导谈判的争论

　　围绕短导谈判的争论
    本报记者  张启昕
    近十几天来，陆基短程核武器问题成了北约国家内部激烈争论的一个焦点。４月２７日西德总理科尔正式在联邦议会提出，希望美国尽快同苏联进行短程导弹和核火炮的谈判。美国对西德此举十分不悦，一再重申美国反对举行这类谈判，声称在华约常规力量仍占优势的情况下，决不能把短导拿到谈判桌上去作交易。争论公开化后，英国支持美国立场，而更多的北约国家则赞成西德的主张。双方的论点归纳起来大致是：一方认为谈判是个“危险的陷阱”，会使北约失去核威慑，从而使北约暴露在华约常规力量优势的威胁之下，而另一方则认为，谈判能导致降低核军备的水平，谋得更大的安全。
    这场争论有着深刻的原因。欧洲的陆基核武器，除核火炮等外，主要是射程在５００公里以下的短程核导弹，处于对峙状态的北约和华约两大军事集团都掌握有不同数量的这类武器。１９８７年１２月美苏签订消除中程导弹和中短程导弹条约之后，短程导弹就成了欧洲核武器中的突出问题。苏联主张双方举行谈判，解决短导问题，但北约内部则见解不一。然而由于种种因素，当时北约采取的立场是：鉴于东西方常规力量不平衡，坚持其传统的“灵活反应”战略，即把核武器作为抵御常规力量进攻的威慑手段，不同意进行短导谈判，同时为了保持这种战略的有效性，原则确定更新现有的短导。但近年来欧洲形势发生了新的变化，特别是去年１２月戈尔巴乔夫提出单方面裁减驻欧常规力量以及随后提出大幅度裁减常规力量的建议，为欧洲军事缓和提供了新的机会。因此当布什政府执政，新任国务卿贝克走访北约各国时，北约是否更新短导，是否应同苏联进行短导谈判，就成了讨论的中心议题。布什政府面对西欧的情绪，作出了某些调整，同意把对更新短导的事推迟到１９９０年西德大选后再定，但是仍坚持短导不能谈判的立场。
    在这场争论中，西德首当其冲是有原因的。从西德国内来看，西德公众历来对部署在西德领土上的核武器敏感，一旦使用这种武器，将直接影响西德。因此各政党都主张谈判减少乃至取消短导。１９９０年底西德举行大选，政府也不能不在这个问题表明态度。然而这场争论不仅发生在美国和西德之间，许多北约国家也卷入其中，其原因则是北约内部对目前欧洲形势看法不一。一些国家认为，欧洲出现了新的裁军机会，北约不应失去这种时机，而某些国家特别是美国则希望更谨慎一些，认为在华约常规力量仍占优势的情况下，短导仍是平衡军事力量的手段，同时它还担心谈判可能导致要求取消短导的压力。然而，美国政府的这种态度引起华盛顿政界的非议。有的批评者认为，布什政府谨慎有余，胆略不足。
    本月２９日至３０日，北约１６个盟国即将在布鲁塞尔举行首脑会议。此间普遍认为，目前发生的这场争论如不解决，不仅对北约的团结产生不利影响，而且还会影响北约今后的战略和谈判方针。
