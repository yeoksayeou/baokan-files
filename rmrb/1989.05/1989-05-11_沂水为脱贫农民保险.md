Stiyu County, located in the Yimeng Mountain area, has been actively developing rural insurance services to provide economic security for impoverished households. The county's poverty alleviation consolidation rate has reached over 98%.

Stiyu County is one of the national key poverty alleviation counties. In recent years, with the development of the rural economy, most households have escaped poverty. However, the ability of poverty-alleviated households to resist disasters and accidents remains low, and they can easily fall back into poverty if they encounter such incidents. To address this issue, the Stiyu County Insurance Company has successively launched various rural insurance services, including home property insurance, motor vehicle insurance, and agricultural production insurance. Currently, 54,000 households in the county have purchased home property insurance, 1,400 agricultural motor vehicles have purchased motor vehicle insurance, and 30,000 people have purchased personal accident insurance, with a total insured value of 3.5 billion yuan.

　　沂水为脱贫农民保险
    本报讯  记者王锦鹄报道：地处沂蒙山区的沂水县积极发展农村保险事业，为脱贫农户提供经济保障，全县农户脱贫巩固率达９８％以上。
    沂水县是全国重点扶贫县之一，近几年，随着农村经济的发展，大多数农户已脱贫，但脱贫农户抗拒灾害事故的能力仍很低，一旦遇到灾害事故重又陷入困境。为此，沂水县保险公司先后开办家财险、机动车辆险、种植、养殖业险等项农村保险业务，全县有５．４万余户农民投保家庭财产险，１４００多台农用机动车辆投保机动车辆险，３万多人投保人身意外伤害险，财产额３．５亿元。
