Recently, while carrying out combat readiness surveying tasks, we discovered that military survey markers in the Tibet region have been severely damaged. Fifty survey markers in the Cona and Zayü regions have all been deliberately destroyed. Some locals have removed the triangular iron from the markers to sell as scrap metal, while others have dismantled wooden survey markers to use for building houses or as firewood. Some have even toppled the survey markers, and in some cases, the "central marker stones" have not been spared. We appeal to relevant departments to take measures, educate the public, cherish national property, and protect the survey markers.

　　西藏军事测绘标志遭劫难
    最近，我们在执行战备测绘任务时，发现西藏地区军事测绘标志破坏严重。错那、察隅两地区的五十个测绘标志都遭到人为破坏。有的群众拆下标志上的三角铁当作废铁卖钱，拆下木质的测绘标志修房子或引火；有的将测绘标志推倒，甚至连测绘标志的“中心标石”都不放过。呼吁有关部门采取措施，教育群众，爱惜国家财产，保护好测绘标志。
