Jiangsu Requires Elimination of Dangerous School Buildings in Primary and Secondary Schools by the End of the Year
	As a Measure to Evaluate the Performance of Leaders at All Levels

	BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Jiangsu Provincial Government recently issued a notice requiring the elimination of all dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools across the province by the end of the year. The notice stipulates that in areas where the problem of dangerous school buildings has not been resolved, government offices are not allowed to build new office buildings or purchase cars.

	Currently, there are 2,220,000 square meters of dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools in Jiangsu Province. Last year, there were nine incidents of school building collapses resulting in injuries and deaths, affecting 47 primary and secondary school students.

	This year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has allocated 18 million yuan from the provincial budget for the repair of dangerous school buildings and has also allocated a certain amount of timber, steel, and cement. At the same time, it requires cities, counties, and townships to find every possible way to raise funds and increase special funds for the repair of dangerous school buildings. Local governments are required to allocate no less than 20% of the funds from halted construction projects of office buildings and other non-essential buildings to the expansion of primary and secondary school buildings.

	The provincial government requires all levels of government to include the elimination of dangerous school buildings in primary and secondary schools as one of the year's work goals and as a measure to evaluate the performance of leaders. For incidents of school building collapses that result in injuries due to ineffective measures, the main responsible leaders will be held accountable.

　　江苏要求年内消除中小学危房    
    以此作为考核各级领导干部内容
    本报南京５月５日电  记者龚永泉报道：江苏省政府日前发出通知，要求年内全省实现中小学无危房，规定在中小学危房问题没有解决的地方，党政机关一律不得兴建楼堂馆所，不得购买小汽车。
    江苏省中小学校舍目前还有危房２２２万平方米。去年全省发生校舍倒塌伤亡事故９起，伤亡中小学生４７人。
    今年，江苏省政府将省财政安排的中小学危房专项款增加到１８００万元，并增拨一定数量的木材、钢材和水泥。同时，要求各市、县、乡也要千方百计地挤出资金，增加危房修建专项经费。各地清理停建的楼堂馆所工程资金，按不低于２０％的比例，专项用于扩建中小学校舍。
    省政府要求各级政府把消除中小学危房列入今年的工作目标，作为考核领导干部工作实绩的内容；对由于措施不力而造成校舍倒塌的伤害事故，要追究主要领导者的责任。
