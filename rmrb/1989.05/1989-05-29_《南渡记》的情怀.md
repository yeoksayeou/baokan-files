It has been a long time since we last saw the pen of Zōng Pú. This year, finally, a new work of hers, "Southward Crossing," quietly lies before us, and it feels somewhat lonely. One can see that she has been deeply troubled by this book. She has sought diligently, perhaps finding only a subtle and understated depth, making one think that such writing is rare these days.

Compared to the sharp and intense, this subtlety is a different style. It is easy to read but difficult to critique. Sometimes one might think that there must be something worth savoring.

I want to make this clearer: the subtlety of "Southward Crossing" mainly lies in its reflection on history. It seems to want to use the threads of thought to brush away the dust of time, returning to those "yellowed" days of the past. More than fifty years have passed since the gunshots at the Lugou Bridge echoed, and the trajectory of modern Chinese history has obviously undergone profound changes. The vicissitudes of life are also imaginable, even the silent flowers and birds seem to weep with the times, saddened by parting. However, those who were in the midst of the turmoil at that time were not yet able to estimate how their future destinies would unfold. People loved their homes, but the weeds had already invaded the steps, and the intention to leave lingered, that scene perhaps already hinted at the broad sense of "home" (cultural, spiritual) that would be lost for a long time? Just as more than fifty years have passed, suddenly looking back, there is much to reminisce about deeply.

In memory, we go back, and at the same time, memory moves forward. Between the past and the present, between home and the distant land, between trials and choices, the main body of life and literature encounters and deals with a kind of relationship. How to deal with it becomes the basic motive for the development of the novel's narrative. Therefore, although "Southward Crossing" does not depict epic-like, dramatic historical events or situations, its scope is not grand, it can reveal the "big" within the "small," gaining subtlety from the patient polishing of a single heart's history, and gaining spirit from a calm narrative. Even if it is a faint trace of blood, it is not something that can be easily wiped away. Reading it, one can feel that it has quietly brewed a sentiment, a taste born from personal experience, when it has discarded the charm of thick ink and heavy colors. Compared to novels that discuss events directly, "Southward Crossing" takes the path of "indicating things and categorizing emotions." As for its "indicating things," regarding such a war, perhaps no work has written about it more narrowly and less "exciting." There are no clashes of sword and gun, no scenes that can shock and move the heart, but one can feel a kind of ordinary people's worry about rise and fall, a sense of bewilderment about grasping fate, equally heart-rending. Its understanding of events and situations is vaguely blurred in the pure hearts of the children, in the inch of affection of kind parents and friends: beautiful days are shattered, warm homes are lost, quiet desks are overturned... Even the originally roaring Beijing has swallowed the pain of humiliation and fallen. This is a kind of formless cruelty, a deeper sorrow. The reason why historical events resurface from memory is that they are connected to and referenced by the journey of the heart that is still worth revisiting today, linked to the undying historical sentiment. Thus, there will be associations, reflections, and thoughts about "categorizing emotions," growing like spring grass outside the story, which may be a sense of vicissitudes beyond the narrative itself—about human nature, about the fate of several generations of intellectuals, about moving from the present to the future... The limitations of "Southward Crossing" in objective description are obvious, just as that segment of history and its understanding embody incompleteness.

Southward, southward, from then on, drifting like a water plant, broken geese and remnants of snow. The ancients have lamented: "The sky is long, the earth is far, with no place to return, lonely and without a path." "Waking up from a drunken sleep, the dream of return is far away." It is a sentiment that transcends the ages, a longing for pain. "Southward Crossing" may have become a typical image in Chinese literary tradition. "No return," "parting sorrow," have gradually evolved from literary themes to cultural metaphors. Similarly, the "farewell" in the novel, although it manifests in different forms, deep or shallow, clear or obscure, in different characters, it ultimately touches on the "dream shattered" in life and psychology. "Farewell" as a cultural ritual in life, its significance may lie in arousing people's awareness of "loss," "searching," and "returning," a belief permeated with sentiment. Although beautiful life is shattered, dreams are no longer gentle and romantic, a ceaseless homesickness will follow them to the ends of the earth, they will inevitably be swept into the historical tide, consciously or unconsciously making their own choices. "What is said about abandoning books, spilling ink, leaving the music room, breaking the jade zither. Tears of pearls flow! Why lament the flickering fireflies?" I think, "Southward Crossing" sings of a certain state of life, spiritual veins, with a tragic sentiment, not limited to the inner chambers, love between men and women. It can be said that in the narrative that seeks authenticity, "farewell" is given new content for recognition and understanding.

Literature these days does not often talk about "typification." This is good because it does not need to artificially create types. This is not to say that literature no longer has the meaning of typification. Typification is not a deliberately crafted model. It seems that Wén Tiānxiáng had such a poem: "The sage is already far away, the typification is in the past, the windy eaves spread the book, the ancient path shines on the face." What is meant by typification, I think, can also be understood as a kind of value life that emerges from specific time and space and yet permeates the world, permeated with the sentiment of life and culture. Therefore, when talking about the character images in "Southward Crossing," individually, none of them are qualified as typifications, but looking at the overall character relationships, looking at that kind of life state, situation, can one not see the subtle and ask about the secrets of human emotions and history? Although the various characters in the "Lǚ family" often appear very thin, lacking the power of action, only leaving some mottled side profiles.

Those who should leave and can leave, have left; those who remain, in the ancient and weeping Beijing, either die with dignity or cowardly survive. People might feel that this novel lacks dramatic effects, lacks comprehensive expressive power, lacks refinement; perhaps they will also feel that life is often like this, which precisely reflects a kind of unconscious state of people's grasp of themselves and history. About the theme of "historical understanding" that many literary works have touched upon, we have the same confusion. Understanding will change in re-experience, but who can say that history can be explained clearly once and for all!

What is our fate? In the wind and rain of history, how do we choose the direction of life, the reconstruction of value life? Such questions were once thought to be solved. In fact, they are often not ideal, even quite tragic. "Southward Crossing" perhaps still poses its own questions—it is the unspoken undertone of hesitation. Regarding these fundamental questions, literature is like life itself, its limited answers, the significance lies in the openness and incompleteness of the answers.

As the first part of the long novel "Wild Gourd Vines," "Southward Crossing" has aroused thoughts and expectations. Whether it is a prelude or a sequence, the road is long, and the meaning is endless. Zōng Pú, strive on! It is rare to have a lonely lamp, a white-haired sentiment. Even if it is a leaf in the wind, it can speak of the news of spring and autumn; a drop of water, the river does not let go. In the end, the more one savors history in a simple and subtle way, the more one speaks of profound meanings. This should be a rare realm.

### 《南渡记》的情怀

　　《南渡记》的情怀
    吴方
    很久不见宗璞的笔墨了。今年终于有她的一部新作温静地摆在面前，且有些寂寞。看得出她被这部《南渡记》熬磨得苦。苦心寻觅，觅处也许只是淡淡的蕴藉，叫人想到，现在这样作小说的不多了。
    与剑拔弩张、浓盐赤酱相比，蕴藉是另一种风度，读起来不难，评它又不易。有时会想，该是有什么可咀嚼的滋味罢。
    我想说明朗一点，《南渡记》之蕴藉，大要在对历史的回味。它好像要借思绪的摸索，拂开岁月之尘，回到往昔那些“发黄”的日子中去。有五十多年了，自卢沟桥那一记枪声呼啸，中国现代历史的轨迹显然有深刻的变动，世事之变迁也是可以想见的，连无言的花鸟也仿佛感时溅泪，恨别惊心。然而当时处在惊变中的人们，尚不足以估计日后的命运会有怎样的转折与归宿。人们爱自己的家园，然而家园的荒草已经侵阶，去意徊徨，那种情景是否已寓示广义的“家园”（文化的、精神的）将会有长久的失落？恰已是五十多年过去，蓦然回首，总有可堪感怀深味者。
    在记忆中回去，同时，记忆走向现在。在过去与现在之间，在家园与天涯、考验与选择之间，生活及文学的主体遭逢并且处理着一种关系。怎样处理，便作成小说叙述发展的基本动机。因此，虽然《南渡记》并没有表现史诗般的、戏剧性的事件史、局势史生活，它的格局不够大，却能于“小”中见其“大”，得蕴藉于对一叶心史的耐心琢磨，得灵气于淡然的叙述中。即或是一抹淡淡的血痕，该不是能轻易擦却的。读它，能觉到它在舍去浓墨重彩的魅力时，悄悄酝酿了一份情怀，一种发自自身体验的况味。比起就事论事的小说来，《南渡记》走的是“指事类情”的路子。就它的“指事”而言，关于这样一场战争，可能没有一部作品比它写得更有限更不“够劲儿”了。没有刀光剑影的冲突，没有可以让人惊心触目的，但能觉到有一种普通人对兴亡的忧患，对命运把握的迷茫感，同样铭心镂骨。它对事件、局势的理解，只是无可如何地漫漶在孩子们纯净的心怀里，在善良父母亲朋的寸草情怀里：美好的日子破碎了，温馨的家园失落了，平静的书桌倾倒了……连原本该怒吼的北平也咽下羞辱的痛苦，陷落了。这是一种无形的残酷，一种更深重的悲哀。历史事象之所以从记忆中重新泛起，乃是因为它联系着参照着至今仍值得人们去返顾的心路历程，结系着未泯的历史情怀。于是，将会有“类情”的联想、体味、思考，从故事之外如春草般萋萋地生长起来，那可能是超生了叙事本身的沧桑之感——关于人性、关于几代知识分子的命运，关于从现在走向未来……《南渡记》客观描写上的有限是明显的，正如那一段历史及其理解体现着未完成性一样。
    南渡，南渡，从此飘萍如寄，断鸿残雪。前人曾咏叹过的：“天长地远无归处，寂寞无行路。”“酒醒熏破春睡，梦远不成归。”原是古今相通的一样情怀，一样眷恋着的痛苦。“南渡”或许已成为中国文学传统中的典型意象了。“无归”、“离恨”，也渐渐由文学的母题积淀为文化的隐喻。同样，小说中的“离别”，虽然在不同人物身上表现着或深或浅或明或暗的不同形态，却终归会涉及到生活与心理上的“梦断”。“离别”作为一种人生中的文化仪式，其意义也许正在于唤起人对“失去”、“寻找”、“皈依”的意识，一种被情怀所浸透着的信念。尽管美好的生活破碎了，梦不再轻柔风流，一缕不绝的乡愁将跟了人到天涯去，他们总要被卷入历史潮流，自觉不自觉地作出自己的选择。“说什么抛了文书，洒了香墨，别了琴馆，碎了玉筝。珠泪倾！又何叹点点流萤？”我想，《南渡记》对某种人生状态、精神意脉的吟咏，虽然自有一番悲剧性的情怀，还不止于闺阁幽怀，儿女情长。可以说，在力求本色的叙述中赋予“离别”以认识理解的新内容。
    这些年的文学不大讲“典型化”了。这样好在不必再去造做典型。这倒也不是说文学不再具有典型性的意味。典型本不是刻意塑造出来的样板。好像文天祥还有过这样的诗句：“哲人日已远，典型在夙昔，风檐展书读，古道照颜色”。所谓典型，我想，不妨也可理解为，从具体时空中生发出来而又能弥漫于天地之间的一种价值生活，渗透着生命，文化的情怀。因此说到《南渡记》的人物形象，分别地看，没有一个够格的典型，但是总体地去看人物关系，去看那样一种生活状态、情境，又何尝不能见微知著，叩问一番人情和历史的隐秘消息。尽管那个“吕家”大家庭中的诸种人物常常显得很单薄，缺少行动的力量，只留下一些斑驳的侧影。
    该走的能走的，走了；留下的，在哭泣的古老的北平，或者死节或者怯懦偷生。人们也许会觉得这部小说太缺少戏剧性效果，缺乏概括的表现力，缺乏提炼；也许又会觉得生活本来就往往如此，这恰恰反映了人对自己对历史把握的一种不自觉状态。关于“历史理解”这一许多文学作品抚触的主题，我们原有着一样的困惑。理解会在重新体验中变化，但谁能说历史能够被一劳永逸地解释清楚！
    我们的命运究竟是怎么一回事？在历史的风风雨雨之中，我们怎样去选择生命定向、价值生活的重建？这样的问题曾经被认为是已经解决了的。事实上往往并不理想，甚至十分可悲。《南渡记》也许仍在提出自己的设问——该是低徊中的弦外之音。就这些基本问题而言，文学正如生活本身，它的有限的回答，其意义正在于回答的开放与未完成性。
    作为长篇小说《野葫芦引》的第一部，《南渡记》引起了思索的期待。自因还是序幕，路延长，意犹不尽，宗璞勉之！难得寂寞青灯，白首情怀。纵然风中一叶，可说春秋消息；涓滴之水，江河不舍。说回来，对历史的回味越朴素入微，也越是言近旨远，这该是难得的境界。
