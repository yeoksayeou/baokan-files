	200,000 Shanghai youth are actively participating in community service activities throughout the city's streets and alleys, providing over a hundred types of voluntary services during their spare time.

	Setting up service points in bustling areas during holidays is one of the main ways Shanghai youth provide voluntary services. On the busy Nanjing Road, service activities are held on the 20th of every month. On this day, 4,200 young employees from shops along the street set up stalls on the sidewalk before the shops open for business. People who have become accustomed to seeking help on this day refer to it as "Leifeng's Birthday."

	Since 1982, Zhuo Zhonglei, a housing management employee from the Longmen Road Housing Management Office in Shanghai, has set up a stall every morning from 6:30 to 8:00 to provide free information on housing adjustments and housing policy consultations for the public. He also provides tools for bicycle repairs. Over the past six years, more than 90,000 people have used his free air pump.

	The youth also volunteer to serve elderly individuals living alone. The daily lives and medical needs of more than 20,000 elderly individuals in the city are taken care of by young volunteers.

    据新华社上海４月３０日电  （记者李健、陆国元）２０万上海青年活跃在上海的大街小巷，开展“为您服务”活动，利用业余时间为社会提供上百种义务服务。
    节假日在闹市区设点，是上海青年提供义务服务的主要方式之一。在繁华的南京路上，服务活动则固定在每月２０日。每到这一天，街道两旁商店的４２００名青年营业员赶在商店开门营业之前，搬出桌椅在路边设摊。已习惯于在这一天前来寻求帮助的人们，称这天是“雷锋的生日”。
    上海市龙门路房管所房管员邹众磊自１９８２年起，每天清晨６时半至８时，设摊义务为群众提供调房信息和房屋政策咨询，同时为群众提供自行车修理工具。６年来在他这里免费使用打气筒的达９万多人次。
    青年们还义务为孤寡老人服务，全市两万多名孤寡老人的日常生活和求药就医问题，都有青年包护。
    据新华社上海４月３０日电（记者刘军）数以万计的大学生昨天踊跃参加了上海市首届大学生校园文化节。由全市５１所高校联合举办的这届文化节，旨在检阅近年来高校校园的文化建设，展示当代大学生朝气蓬勃的精神风貌和纪念“五四”运动７０周年。
    参加这届校园文化节的人数是历次类似活动最多的一次，全市５１所高校都组队参加了声乐比赛，参加辩论比赛的也有３２个队。参加大合唱、歌舞比赛的人数最多，有上万名学生和教师。
    共青团上海市委、上海市学联、上海市高教局还联合举办了比赛项目，有大合唱、大辩论、诗歌朗诵等。并将举行校园文化建设的学术讨论。
