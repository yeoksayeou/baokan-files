Title: Space Junk Needs to Be Cleaned Up Urgently

Space should be a clean environment, but it has now become a chaotic place filled with debris. Among the space junk, there are tens of thousands of metal and plastic fragments of various sizes, as well as about 7,000 larger objects. Even a fragment the size of a coin, traveling at a speed of 17,000 miles per hour in orbit, can cause serious damage to a spacecraft, even destroying it.

Last summer, at an international space scientists conference held in the UK, it was asserted that if these fragments continue to accumulate at the current rate, the situation will become unbearable within 10 years. It is urgent to further understand the current situation of the junk accumulating in space. The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration has asked the industry to develop a radar by 1991 that can track targets as small as a few centimeters in low Earth orbit. This is equivalent to tracking a coin at an altitude of several hundred kilometers.

However, what is needed is not just tracking. The rapid accumulation of these fragments has already increased the cost of space travel. The "Hubble" space telescope, scheduled to be launched this year, may have operating costs in its first two years that are three times the estimated figure proposed by its designers 10 years ago. New satellites are equipped with protective shields, increasing costs and reducing effective payload. For example, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration has added an additional protective shield weighing 12,000 pounds to protect the manned section of its planned space station.

Countries currently using Earth orbits must take action now to reduce the waste they produce. Rockets and spacecraft should be designed with the aim of reducing debris. It is possible to recover artificial satellites. If anti-satellite tests are conducted, they can be done at relatively low altitudes to ensure that the resulting debris quickly re-enters the atmosphere.

Countries should also cooperate in finding ways to remove existing junk, including an increasing number of failed artificial satellites, some of which are equipped with nuclear reactors. Currently, most of these artificial satellites are placed in higher Earth orbits. In the next 20 years, the near-Earth orbit will be used more frequently, and these discarded objects will become dangerous obstacles.

### 太空垃圾亟待清理

　　太空垃圾亟待清理
    太空应当是一个纯净的环境，但是现在却成为堆满废物的混乱局面。在太空废弃物中有数以万计大小不等的金属块、塑料块和油漆碎屑，以及约有７０００个较大的物体。即使是一块硬币那么大的碎片在轨道以每小时１７０００英里的速度运行，也会给一个航天器造成严重损害，甚至会毁掉它。
    去年夏天，在英国召开的一次国际太空科学家会议断言，假如这种碎片照目前的速度聚积下去，那么不出１０年这种情况就会变得令人无法忍受了。需要马上进一步了解现在云集太空的垃圾的情况。美国国家航空和航天局已要求工业界在１９９１年以前研制出一种雷达，能跟踪近地轨道上的大小只有几公分的目标。这就等于要在几百公里高处跟踪一枚硬币。
    然而，所需要的不仅仅是跟踪。这些碎片迅速积聚，已经给宇宙航行增加了费用。今年将要发射的“哈勃”天文望远镜在头两年的运行费用很可能相当于它的设计者们在１０年前提出的估计数字的３倍。在新的人造卫星上增加了防护罩，从而增加了费用，减少了有效载荷。例如，美国国家航空和航天局为保护其计划发射的太空站住人的部分而增加了重达１２０００磅的额外防护罩。
    正在使用地球轨道的国家必须现在就采取行动减少它们制造的废弃物。火箭和航天器在设计时应考虑到减少碎片的问题。可以使人造卫星能够回收。如果进行反卫星试验，可以在相当低的空间进行，以使其产生的碎片很快重新进入大气层。
    各国还应该在寻求清除现有垃圾的方法方面合作，其中包括数量不断增加的失效人造卫星，有的还装有核反应堆。而目前这些人造卫星大部分都被搁置在更高的地球轨道上。今后的２０年太空近地轨道运用更加频繁，这些废弃物将成为危险的妨害因素。
