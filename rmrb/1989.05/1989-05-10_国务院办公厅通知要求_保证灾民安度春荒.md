The State Council Office today issued the "Notice on Arranging the Living Conditions of Disaster-Affected Populations," requiring all levels of government and relevant departments to strengthen disaster relief work and ensure that disaster-affected populations can survive the spring hunger period.

The notice points out that since last year, China has frequently experienced natural disasters, which have brought many difficulties to the production and living conditions of disaster-affected populations. Currently, it is the period when crops are not yet mature, and the work of arranging living conditions for disaster-affected populations has reached a critical moment. The State Council requires all levels of government and relevant departments to do the following:

1. Ensure that relief grain and funds are promptly delivered to disaster victims. All levels of government must immediately organize cadres to go deep into disaster areas, divide responsibilities by region, and ensure that each person is responsible for checking and arranging the implementation situation in each village and household. Any problems discovered must be resolved immediately; if they cannot be resolved, they must be promptly reported to higher authorities, leaving no gaps. Those who neglect their duties in disaster relief work must be seriously dealt with; those who embezzle, misappropriate, deduct, or privately distribute relief grain and funds must be severely punished according to law.

2. Relief grain and funds must be focused on key areas. The scope of relief must be strictly controlled, with a focus on disaster areas with greater difficulties and severely affected households. Issues such as average distribution and favoritism must be strictly prohibited.

3. Continue to focus on grain transportation work. In receiving areas, transportation fees and price subsidies must be ensured; relief grain must be promptly delivered to villages. In sending areas, the overall situation must be considered, and grain must be organized and shipped according to the plan, without any reason affecting the implementation of the transportation plan.

4. Actively organize disaster victims for self-reliant production and mutual aid. Disaster-affected governments at all levels must reasonably deploy labor, while ensuring spring plowing and strengthening field management of summer crops, to carry out some off-farm but local industrial and sideline productions as much as possible, expanding income sources and increasing self-reliance capabilities. Non-disaster areas should support disaster areas, cities should support rural disaster areas, and mutual aid activities among the people, neighbors, and friends should be organized to help disaster victims survive the hunger period.

　　国务院办公厅通知要求    
    保证灾民安度春荒
    新华社北京５月１０日电  国务院办公厅今天发出《关于做好灾区群众生活安排的通知》，要求各级政府和有关部门加强救灾工作，保证灾区群众安度春荒。
    通知指出，去年以来，我国自然灾害频繁，给灾区群众的生产和生活带来了不少困难。目前，正处于青黄不接的时期，灾区群众生活的安排工作已进入关键时刻。国务院要求各级政府和有关部门做好以下几项工作：
    一、要把救灾粮、款迅速落实到灾民手中。各级政府要立即组织干部深入灾区，分片包干，责任到人，逐村逐户地检查安排落实情况，发现问题，立即解决，不能解决的要及时向上反映，不留漏洞。对在救灾工作中玩忽职守者要严肃处理；对贪污、挪用、克扣、私分救灾粮、款者，要依法严加惩处。
    二、救灾粮、款要保证重点。要严格控制救济面，重点保证困难大的灾区和重灾户。对平均发放、优亲厚友等问题要严加制止。
    三、要继续抓好粮食调运工作。调入地区，一定要落实调粮运费和差价补贴；要把救灾粮及时运到乡村。调出地区要顾全大局，切实按计划组织好粮食发运，不得以任何理由影响调运计划的实施。
    四、要积极组织灾民生产自救，互助互济。灾区各级政府要合理部署劳力，在搞好春耕生产、加强夏收作物田间管理的同时，尽量开展一些离土不离乡的工副业生产，扩大收入来源，增加自救能力。要把非灾区支援灾区，城市支援农村灾区，以及群众间、邻里间、亲友间的互助互济活动组织好，帮助灾民安全度荒。
