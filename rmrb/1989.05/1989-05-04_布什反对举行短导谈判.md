Bush Opposes Short-Range Missile Talks

President Bush today reiterated his opposition to holding short-range missile talks with the Soviet Union. During his meeting with visiting Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland, he stated that due to the Soviet Union's advantage in conventional forces, holding short-range missile talks would be a mistake. However, Brundtland told reporters that Norway supports U.S.-Soviet short-range missile talks.

In recent days, the Bush administration's stance against short-range missile talks has been criticized within the United States. Senator Sam Nunn, Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, believes that short-range missile talks can be conducted in conjunction with the reduction of conventional forces without completely eliminating short-range missiles. Former Reagan administration arms control advisor Paul Nitze criticized, saying that refusing short-range missile talks would isolate the United States within NATO. He believes that as long as the talks aim to reduce short-range missiles rather than completely eliminate them, the United States should agree to West Germany's proposal to hold such talks.

　　布什反对举行短导谈判
    本报华盛顿５月３日电  布什总统今天再次重申他反对同苏联举行短导谈判。他在与来访的挪威首相布伦特兰夫人会谈时说，由于苏联在常规力量上占有优势，举行短导谈判将是错误的，但布伦特兰夫人对记者说。挪威赞成美苏进行短导谈判。
    近日，布什政府反对短导谈判的立场在美国国内受到批评。参院军事委员会主席纳恩认为，在不全部消除短导的条件下，短导谈判可以同削减常规力量联系起来进行。前里根政府裁军顾问尼采批评说，拒绝短导谈判将使美国在北约内处于孤立地位。他认为，只要谈判是为了削减短导，而不是完全消除短导，美国就应该同意西德提出的举行谈判的主张。
