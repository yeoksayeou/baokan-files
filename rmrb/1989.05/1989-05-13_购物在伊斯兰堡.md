Shopping in Islamabad
Rényùjùn

After being accustomed to the attitudes of some salespeople in Beijing, the author has enjoyed the dignity and joy of shopping in Islamabad for a year.

Stimulating the Customer's Desire to Shop

The shopkeepers and vendors in Islamabad have a knack for attracting and stimulating customers' desire to shop. As soon as a customer enters, the staff greet them with a smile and a warm welcome, which is the bare minimum of courtesy. Skilled staff can quickly anticipate the customer's needs, often placing the desired items on the counter before the customer even speaks. They then provide a detailed introduction, followed by an expectant look, waiting for the customer's instructions. In such a situation, it feels almost impolite not to buy something. After the customer pays, the cashier's "thank you" is not just a formality; it makes you feel that they genuinely appreciate your patronage.

In fabric stores, shoe stores, and jewelry shops, there are usually seats in front of the counter. Customers can sit there, leisurely selecting and trying on items, while the staff patiently introduce the colors, styles, and prices. Once, a few Chinese customers entered a jewelry store in Islamabad. The shop owner greeted them with a broad smile, inviting them to sit on the sofas, and praised the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples. Immediately, young assistants brought each Chinese customer a cup of steaming hot coffee. While they sipped their coffee, the shop owner began discussing business, saying, "We are happy to serve our Chinese friends and meet all your needs." As a result, each of the Chinese customers bought at least one piece of jewelry. A Chinese journalist humorously remarked that he dared not easily enter stores in both Beijing and Islamabad. In Beijing, it's because he fears encountering a cold-faced salesperson and leaving with a belly full of anger; in Islamabad, it's because he fears the enthusiastic shop owner will empty his wallet.

Shopkeepers Think Ahead of Customers

In Islamabad, all you need to bring when shopping is your wallet; you don't need to carry a basket or a bag. Once, the author bought eggs, milk, bread, sugar, and several other items in a grocery store. The shopkeeper had already packaged everything neatly. Just as the author was wondering how to carry it all, a young assistant cheerfully picked up most of the items and carried them to the car. Later, it was discovered that whenever you buy a lot of items or heavy things, the store assistants will always help you carry them to the car, and they do not accept tips. If you buy large appliances or furniture, the shopkeepers have delivery trucks ready, and the assistants will carry the items to where you want them placed.

Although Islamabad does not have television shopping, telephone shopping is quite convenient. If you need to exchange soda, just make a phone call, and the delivery car will arrive immediately to exchange the bottles. If you need curtains, the fabric store owner will send someone with samples for you to choose from as soon as they receive your call. They will measure the size, confirm the style, and deliver the finished curtains. The furniture store owners are even more proactive in business. A Chinese company in Islamabad had already rented an office but was not satisfied with the furniture in the store. Just as they were at a loss, the shop owner offered a solution: the store would provide them with a set of furniture for immediate use, while simultaneously custom-making a set of furniture to their satisfaction. This two-in-one approach secured the 10,000-plus rupee deal for the store.

Competition and Professionalism Go Hand in Hand

Islamabad does not have large department stores like Beijing's Department Store, but rather many small, specialized shops, most of which are owner-operated. In these markets, similar shops are usually located together, making it convenient for customers to compare and choose, and naturally intensifying the competition among the shops. In addition to competing in product sources and varieties, the prices are basically the same. Therefore, customers often choose based on which shop has the better service attitude. Shop owners go out of their way to attract customers, and from the owner to the assistants, they all have a smile and sweet words.

Pakistan is a Muslim country, and the teachings of the Quran say that work is a gift from Allah, and it must be done well, not poorly. Doing one's job well is fulfilling Allah's will. Such teachings naturally have a guiding effect on the believers. Pakistan's unemployment problem is still quite serious, and it is not easy for a young person to become an apprentice in a shop. The shop owner and the apprentice have strict contracts, and reliable guarantors are required. If the shop owner finds that the apprentice has misbehaved, they can dismiss them immediately. Therefore, whether in shops or workshops, the apprentices are all well-behaved and obedient.

Private ownership, fierce competition, and professional education from religious teachings to social norms make Pakistan's service industry attitude enthusiastic, meticulous, and considerate.

### 购物在伊斯兰堡

　　购物在伊斯兰堡
    任毓骏
    看惯北京一些售货员的脸色后，一年来，笔者在伊斯兰堡一直享受着购物者的尊严和快乐。
    吸引顾客的购物欲
    伊斯兰堡的大小店主、摊主很有一套吸引、刺激顾客购物欲的办法。顾客一进门，伙计笑脸相迎，连声问好，这是起码的礼遇。善于察颜观色的伙计马上随顾客的目光行动，几乎在你开口的同时，就能把你所要的东西拿到柜台上，紧接着是一连串的介绍。然后，伙计以期待的眼光等你的吩咐。在这种情况下，不买人家的东西真有点不好意思。顾客付款后，收款员的那一声“谢谢”绝不是敷衍了事，而是让你感到他是真诚地感谢你赏了他的光。
    在布店、鞋店、首饰店里，柜台前一般都设有一排座位。顾客可以坐在柜台前，随意挑选、试戴，伙计则不厌其烦地为你介绍花色、款式、价格。有一次，几位中国顾客进入伊斯兰堡一家首饰店，店主满脸堆笑地让他们坐在沙发椅上，还称赞了一番兄弟的中国人民和巴基斯坦的人民的友谊。紧接着，小伙计为每个中国客人端上一杯热腾腾的咖啡。就在喝咖啡中，店主已开始谈生意，“愿意为中国朋友效劳，满足各位的要求”。结果，这几位中国顾客每人起码买了一件首饰。一位中国记者幽默地说，他在北京和伊斯兰堡都不敢轻易进商店。在北京，是怕遇上冷面郎君，装一肚子气；在伊斯兰堡，是怕热情的店主掏空自己的腰包。
    店主比顾客想得周到
    在伊斯兰堡，买东西只要带钱包就行，用不着提篮或背兜。有一次笔者在一个食品店里买了鸡蛋、牛奶、面包、糖等好几种东西，店主都已一包包装好。我正发愁不好拿的时候，一位小伙计已笑盈盈地为我提起大部分东西，一直把我送上汽车。以后才发现，只要你买的东西较多或较重，总有店伙计送你上车，而且不收小费。如果你买较大的电器或家具，店主都备有送货车，随车的伙计还会把东西扛到你要安置的地方。
    伊斯兰堡虽然没有电视购物，但电话购物也相当快捷方便。你要换汽水，一个电话打去，汽车随即而来，搬汽水，送空瓶，都由伙计动手。你要做窗帘，布店老板接到电话后，马上会派人拿来布料任你挑选，帮你量好尺寸，定好款式，做好后还派人送来帮你挂上。家具店的老板更会兜生意。一家中国驻伊斯兰堡的公司已租好房子准备办公，但对家具店里现货不满意。正在为难时，店主献上妙策：店里无偿供给他们一套家具以备办公所急需，同时抓紧时间为他们定做一套满意的家具。这两全齐美的办法使这笔１万多卢比的生意没有落到竞争者手中。
    竞争与敬业并重
    伊斯兰堡并没有北京百货大楼那样的巨型商场，多是专营性中小商店，绝大多数是店主自营。在这些市场里，同行的商店基本排列在一处，这样方便了顾客对比之后选购，当然也加剧了各个商店之间的竞争。店主们除在货源、花色品种方面竞争外，标价基本是一致的。这样，顾客买哪个商店的东西，多取决于谁家的服务态度更好。所以店主想方设法招徕顾客，从店主到小伙计都练出一副笑脸和甜嘴皮。
    巴基斯坦是穆斯林国家，古兰经教义说，工作是阿拉赐给的，只能做好，不能做坏，做好自己的一份工作，就是完成了阿拉的旨意。这样的教规对教徒当然有教诫作用。巴基斯坦的失业问题仍相当严重，对一个年轻人来说，能在商店当学徒很不容易。店主和店员订有条件严格的合同，还要求有靠得住的保证人。店主如发现学徒有不规行为，说辞退就辞退。所以，无论在商店或是作坊，学徒们一个个规规矩矩，很是听话。
    私营、激烈的竞争和从教义到社会的敬业教育，使巴基斯坦服务业态度热情、仔细、周到。
