The Soviet Union is scheduled to convene its first Congress of People's Deputies on May 25. The Congress will elect the Supreme Soviet and a new Soviet government.

The 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, held in June 1988, adopted the resolution "On the Democratization of Soviet Society and the Reform of the Political System." The resolution outlined a blueprint for a fundamental reform of the state's political system, deciding to establish a new supreme authority—the Congress of People's Deputies—to replace the current Supreme Soviet. The Supreme Soviet, elected from among the deputies of the Congress, will be a permanent body that performs legislative, executive, and supervisory functions. Through this system reform, a socialist rule-of-law state will be established, allowing various social strata and the broad masses of the people to truly participate in politics and governance.

The Congress of People's Deputies consists of 2,250 people's deputies elected democratically. Of these, 750 deputies are elected from regions in proportion to the population, with one deputy for every 257,300 voters; 750 deputies are elected from national regions according to the following quotas: 32 deputies from each union republic, 11 deputies from each autonomous republic, 5 deputies from each autonomous oblast, and 1 deputy from each autonomous okrug. The remaining 750 deputies are elected from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the Komsomol, trade unions, women's federations, various creative unions, and other national social organizations. This is the first time in the Soviet Union that representatives directly elected by mass social organizations will participate in the highest state authority, aiming to better reflect and represent the interests and wishes of various strata of Soviet society, making the highest state authority more representative.

The Supreme Soviet has a Presidium. It consists of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the First Deputy Chairman, the Chairmen of the Supreme Soviets of 15 union republics, and the Chairmen of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet. The functions of the Presidium include: preparing for the sessions of the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet; performing a series of functions as the "collective head of state": conferring honors, conferring military ranks, appointing and recalling Soviet diplomatic representatives, accepting the credentials of foreign ambassadors, and granting amnesties. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet is elected by the Congress of People's Deputies through a secret ballot from among the deputies, with a term of five years, and may not serve more than two consecutive terms. The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet is accountable to the Congress of People's Deputies and the Supreme Soviet, and is responsible for solving key issues in the country's domestic affairs, foreign affairs, and defense. At the same time, he leads the Defense Council, proposes candidates for the First Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and the head of the government, with powers greater than the current Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.

　　苏联人民代表大会
    苏联定于５月２５日召开第一届苏联人民代表大会，大会将选举苏联最高苏维埃和新的苏联政府。
    １９８８年６月召开的苏共第１９次代表大会通过了《关于苏联社会民主化和政治体制改革》的决议。决议提出了一个对国家的政治体制进行根本改革的蓝图，决定成立新的最高权力机构——苏联人民代表大会，取代现在的苏联最高苏维埃。苏联人民代表大会从代表中选出的苏联最高苏维埃，将是人民代表大会的常设机构，它履行立法、执行和监督职能。通过这一体制改革，建立社会主义法制国家，让社会各阶层和广大人民群众真正参政议政。
    苏联人民代表大会由经民主选举出来的２２５０名人民代表组成。其中，７５０名代表是按人口比例从地区中选出的，每２５７３００名选民中产生一名代表；７５０名代表从民族地区按下述定额选出：每个加盟共和国选出３２名代表，每个自治共和国选出１１名代表，每个自治州选出５名代表，每个自治专区选出１名代表；其余７５０名代表由苏联共产党、共青团、工会、妇联、各创作协会及其他全国性社会团体中选出。由群众性社会团体直接选出本团体的代表参加国家最高权力机构，在苏联尚属首次，其目的是更好地反映和代表苏联各阶层的利益和愿望，使国家最高权力机构更具有代表性。
    苏联最高苏维埃设最高苏维埃主席团。它由苏联最高苏维埃主席、第一副主席、１５个加盟共和国最高苏维埃主席、苏最高苏维埃两院的主席等人组成。主席团的权力职能是：负责筹备人民代表大会会议和最高苏维埃会议；履行“国家集体元首”的一系列职能：授勋、授军衔、任命和召回苏联外交代表，接受外国大使的国书，实行大赦。最高苏维埃主席由苏联人民代表大会通过无记名投票从人民代表中选出，每届任期５年，连任不得超过两届。苏联最高苏维埃主席对苏联人民代表大会和苏联最高苏维埃负责，他负责解决国家的内政、外交、国防等方面的关键问题，同时领导国防委员会、提出苏联最高苏维埃第一副主席、政府首脑人选等，其职权大于现在的最高苏维埃主席团主席。
