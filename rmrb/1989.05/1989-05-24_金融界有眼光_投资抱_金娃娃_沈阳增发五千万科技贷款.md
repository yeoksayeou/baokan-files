The financial sector has vision and invests in "golden children." Shenyang increases scientific and technological loans by 50 million yuan.

BEIJING, May 24 — At a recent dialogue meeting between Shenyang's scientific and technological sector and the financial sector, representatives from the People's Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank, Agricultural Bank, Bank of Communications, Cooperative Bank, and the Shenyang branch of the Bank of China unanimously stated that investing in scientific and technological development projects is like investing money in "golden children." In the current situation of tight fiscal conditions, they have decided to increase this year's scientific and technological loans by 25% compared to last year. This will add another 50 million yuan in scientific and technological loans for the city.

Shenyang has traditionally focused on expanding production capacity through external means, with only 1% of annual construction investment going towards technological advancements and new product development for enterprises. Due to a lack of funds, many scientific and technological achievements with great development potential have not been able to be transformed into products, and 70% of the city's scientific and technological achievements have flowed to other regions. To increase the momentum of economic development and improve the efficiency of fund use, the Shenyang Municipal Science and Technology Commission organized a direct dialogue between the leaders of six banks and 18 scientific research institutes to enhance understanding and cooperation between the scientific and technological sector and the financial sector. The Shenyang Foundry Research Institute's development of special steel-making coke, which exceeds Japanese counterparts in six technical indicators, has attracted foreign orders for 3,000 tons, each priced at $160. However, due to a lack of funds, the institute has been unable to put this technology into production. The representative from the Shenyang branch of the Bank of China immediately stated that after verification, priority loans can be provided for this technological development.

According to statistics from the 30 projects presented at the dialogue meeting to the financial sector, these projects can generate 4.19 billion yuan in output value, 1 billion yuan in taxes and profits, and over 20 million US dollars in foreign exchange within one year of production, with an input-output ratio of 1:8. The representatives from the People's Bank of China Shenyang branch and the other five banks stated: Investing money in such "golden children" is worthwhile.

　　金融界有眼光　投资抱“金娃娃”
    沈阳增发五千万科技贷款
    本报沈阳５月２４日电  在最近结束的沈阳市科技界与金融界对话会上，人民银行、工商银行、农业银行、交通银行、合作银行、中国银行沈阳分行的负责人一致表示，投资科技开发项目，等于把钱投到“金娃娃”身上。在目前财政紧张的情况下，他们决定今年的科技贷款比去年再增加２５％。这样，全市又增加科技贷款５０００万元。
    沈阳市以往注重通过外延扩大企业的再生产能力，用于企业技术进步和开发新产品的投资只占每年建设投资总额的１％。由于缺少资金，许多很有开发前景的科技成果难以转化为产品，全市有７０％的科技成果流往外地。为了增加经济发展的后劲，提高资金使用效益，沈阳市科委组织全市６家银行的负责人与１８个科研院所的领导直接对话，增进科技界与金融界的理解和联系。沈阳铸造研究所研制的特种炼钢焦炭，６项技术指标都超过日本同类产品水平，外商一次就要定货３０００吨，每吨出价１６０美元，但由于缺少资金，该所无力把这项技术投入生产。中国银行沈阳分行的负责人当场表示经过论证后，可向该项技术开发优先贷款。
    仅据在对话会上提供给金融界的３０个项目统计，投产后一年内，可创产值４．１９亿元，利税１亿元，创外汇２０００多万美元，投入产出比为１∶８。中国人民银行沈阳分行等６家银行的负责人表示：把钱投在这样的“金娃娃”身上，值得。
