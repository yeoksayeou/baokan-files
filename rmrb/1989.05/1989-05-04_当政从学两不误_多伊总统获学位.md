Liberian President Samuel Doe graduated from the University of Liberia on May 3, earning a Bachelor of Arts degree.

The university's president, Yekeson, said at the graduation ceremony for 389 students that Doe and four other government officials had completed the required courses for a Bachelor of Arts degree after a three-and-a-half-year program designed for them.

The 39-year-old Liberian leader said at the graduation ceremony that his graduation was the result of his determination to continue his higher education. Over the past three years, he handled official duties in the presidential office in the morning and studied at the university from 4 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

Doe, who was a junior high school graduate before enlisting in the military in 1969, attended two years of high school night classes in 1980. He said, "I feel that with better education, I will be able to contribute more to this country." Reports from the region say Doe is the first African leader to pursue education while in office.

    多伊总统获学位
    新华社蒙罗维亚５月３日电  利比里亚总统塞缪尔·多伊３日从利比里亚大学毕业，获文学学士学位。
    利比里亚大学校长耶凯松今天在这里为３８９位毕业生举行的毕业典礼上说，多伊总统和其他４名政府官员经过校方为他们设置的３年半课程的学习，已经完成了文学学士应选修的课程。
    这位３９岁的利比里亚领导人在毕业典礼上说，他的毕业是他决心继续接受高等教育的结果。在过去的３年多里，他上午在总统府办公室处理公务，下午４点到晚７点半到大学学习。
    多伊在１９６９年入伍之前，是一位初中毕业生。１９８０年参加过两年高中夜校学习。他说，“我感到由于接受了更好的教育，将能为这个国家作出更大的贡献。”此间报道说，多伊是当政时期从学的第一位非洲国家领导人。
