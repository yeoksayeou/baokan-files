According to incomplete statistics, the Beijing Municipal Post Office has handled 2.388 million pieces of mail to and from Taiwan in the past three years. For some letters with incorrect addresses, old addresses, or even just the recipient's nickname, postal workers have gone to great lengths to ensure delivery, expressing their deep affection for compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. To date, not a single letter has been returned undelivered.

Since the Taiwan authorities allowed residents to visit mainland China, millions of letters have flown back and forth between the two sides, with the volume increasing rapidly. In Beijing alone, the number of letters exchanged between the two sides was 349,000 in 1986, 400,000 in 1987, 579,000 in 1988, and over 1.06 million in the first four months of this year. Postal workers in Beijing have spared no effort to deliver letters from Taiwan residents seeking their relatives. For some undeliverable letters, eight sub-bureaus have attempted delivery. Delivery personnel have used their spare time and rest days to walk the streets, visiting police stations, public security bureaus, and neighborhood elders, checking archives and relocation records, and helping thousands of Beijing residents who went to Taiwan find their relatives who had been separated for over 40 years. Some have already reunited with their families.

For many letters that could not be delivered despite multiple attempts, the Beijing Municipal Post Office has published notices in newspapers, listing the registration numbers of the undeliverable letters and placing them at the service counter of the Beijing International Post Office at Jianguomen. Recipients can go there to claim their letters once they see the notice.

　　北京受理台湾邮件
    三年超过两百万件
    本报北京５月２３日讯  记者赖仁琼报道：据不完全统计，北京市邮政局３年来共处理对台邮件２３８．８万余件。对一些地址书写错误或老门牌、甚至只写着收信人乳名的千奇百怪的“死信”，广大邮政职工千方百计投递，满腔深情为海峡两岸同胞搭“桥”，至今为止，尚未退回一封“死信”。
    台湾当局允许百姓赴大陆探亲以来，数百万封家书飞往大陆，且数量急剧上升。仅北京台湾两地来往信件，１９８６年为３４．９万件，１９８７年为４０万件，１９８８年为５７．９万件，今年１—４月多达１０６万余件。北京市邮政局广大职工竭尽全力投递台胞寻亲信，有的“死信”在８个支局试投。投递员利用业余时间和工休日走街串巷，遍访派出所、公安局和街坊老人，查档案、搬迁登记簿等，使数千名北京去台人员找到了失散４０余年的亲人，有的已与家人团聚。
    有不少经投递员多方投递仍未投出的“死信”，北京市邮政局便在报上刊登寻亲信，将“死信”登记编号后放置在北京建国门国际邮局服务台，收信人一俟见报，便可去此处认领。
