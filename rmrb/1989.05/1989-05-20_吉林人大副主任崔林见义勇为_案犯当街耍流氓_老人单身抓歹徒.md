The story of Cui Lin, Vice Chairman of the Jilin Provincial People's Congress, bravely acting to uphold justice and capturing a hooligan, has recently spread throughout the provincial capital of Changchun.

At around 3 PM on May 9th, after returning home to give a key to a guest, Cui Lin walked back to the offices of the Jilin Provincial People's Congress. Near the "Fourth Precinct" small market, he saw a young man in broad daylight grabbing a passing female youth, forcibly embracing and kissing her. The victim struggled free, and the hooligan grabbed another. Several dozen passersby all avoided the scene, and no one dared to intervene. Cui Lin stepped forward, and when he was about ten meters away from the hooligan, he shouted, "What do you think you're doing, you scoundrel?" At that moment, the fourth victim, a girl of about fifteen or sixteen, took the opportunity to break free. Facing the tall hooligan, who was about 1.75 meters tall, this small-statured, over sixty-year-old comrade did not hesitate. He stepped forward and grabbed the hooligan's arm, calling on the female victim to help capture the hooligan. The female youth turned and ran away. The hooligan suddenly threw off Cui Lin and fled. Cui Lin chased after him, shouting, "Catch the scoundrel! Catch the hooligan!" After chasing for over 200 meters, no one on the street helped. The hooligan fled into the inpatient department of the Chaoyang District Hospital. Cui Lin called out to two young men in front of the hospital (one was a student from Jilin University, and the other was the child of a teacher from the same school) to help, asking them to quickly report to the public security substation. He himself searched the inpatient department and finally captured the hooligan, handing him over to the plainclothes police who had arrived, and together they took the hooligan to the Yihe Road Substation.

Cui Lin is of Korean ethnicity and often goes "incognito" to investigate. He always likes to intervene when he sees injustice. From Cui Lin's home to the office, it takes 20 minutes to walk. Although the office had arranged a car for him, he did not use it. His secretary was not with him that afternoon due to other matters.

The Yihe Road Substation immediately interrogated and gathered evidence from the hooligan. The man claimed to be from Harbin, named Liu Cheng, 19 years old. Relevant authorities are expediting the handling of this case.

　　吉林人大副主任崔林见义勇为
    案犯当街耍流氓　老人单身抓歹徒
    本报长春电  ６２岁的吉林省人大常委会副主任崔林见义勇为、擒获流氓分子的事迹，近日在省城长春市传开。
    ５月９日下午３时左右，崔林在回家给客人送钥匙后，徒步返回省人大常委会机关，走到“四分局”附近小市场时，看到一个男青年在光天化日之下抓住过路的女青年，强行拥抱接吻，被抓者挣脱后，歹徒便再抓一个，几十个行路人纷纷躲避，无人敢管。崔林迎上前去，与流氓分子相距十余米时一声断喝：“你这坏蛋想干什么？”这时，第四个受害者、十五六岁的女孩乘机挣脱。面对身高１．７５米左右的歹徒，这位身材矮小、年逾六旬的老同志毫不犹豫，上前一把抓住歹徒的胳膊，并招呼受害女青年一同抓歹徒。女青年扭头跑掉。歹徒猛然甩开崔林便逃。崔林一边追，一边呼喊：“抓坏蛋啊！抓流氓啊！”追出２００多米，沿街竟无人帮忙。歹徒逃进朝阳区医院住院部。崔林招呼医院门前的两位男青年（一名是吉林大学学生，一名是该校老师的孩子）帮助，要他们迅即报告公安派出所，他自己到住院部搜寻，终于将歹徒抓获，与闻讯赶到的便衣警察一道，将歹徒扭送到义和路派出所。
    崔林是朝鲜族人，时常“微服私访”，路见不平总爱管管。从崔林家到机关要走２０分钟，本来机关已给他安排了小车，他没坐；他的秘书当天下午因事也没在身边。
    义和路派出所当即对流氓分子进行了审讯取证，该人自称是哈尔滨人，叫刘成，１９岁。有关机关正抓紧审理此案。
