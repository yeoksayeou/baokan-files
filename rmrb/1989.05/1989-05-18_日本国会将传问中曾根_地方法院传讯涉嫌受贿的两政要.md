Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 18th.

Today in the afternoon, Japan's opposition parties and the Liberal Democratic Party held negotiations. The Liberal Democratic Party was forced to agree to the opposition parties' demand to have the parliament question former Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro. Negotiations will continue tomorrow to determine the specific schedule.

Since the beginning of this parliamentary session, the opposition parties have consistently demanded that the parliament question Nakasone regarding his involvement in the Recruit stock scandal. After the Liberal Democratic Party refused, the opposition parties boycotted the House of Representatives' deliberations, causing the House to reach a stalemate. The Liberal Democratic Party then passed the annual budget on its own. As the parliamentary session is about to end, to restore normal deliberations and break the stalemate, the Liberal Democratic Party was forced to agree to have the parliament question Nakasone.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 17th.

The Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office today summoned two political figures suspected of accepting bribes.

They are Liberal Democratic Party member of the House of Representatives Fujio Masayuki and former member of the House of Representatives from the Clean Government Party Ikeda Katsuya. Fujio Masayuki previously served as the Chief Cabinet Secretary in Nakasone's cabinet. Ikeda Katsuya previously served as a member of the House of Representatives Budget Committee.

According to the released materials, while serving as the Chief Cabinet Secretary, Fujio Masayuki allegedly used his position to maintain a favorable employment agreement for Recruit Company, arranging for the company's former chairman, Ezoe Koji, to serve as a special member of the government's Tax System Research Council, in exchange for Ezoe Koji's 60 million yen in private political donations and 12,000 shares of unlisted stock.

Ikeda Katsuya is suspected of making statements favorable to Recruit Company, in exchange for 500 shares of unlisted stock and 14 million yen in private political donations from the company.

    自本届国会举行以来，在野党一直要求国会传问中曾根，就他涉嫌利库路特股票丑闻的问题作出解释。遭到自民党拒绝后，在野党拒绝出席众院审议活动，使众院会议陷入僵局，自民党单独表决，通过了本年度预算。本届国会会期将尽，为恢复正常审议活动，打开僵局，自民党被迫同意国会传问中曾根。
