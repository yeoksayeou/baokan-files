Title: Fortune-Telling, Divination, and Palm Reading Are Common on the Streets of Xi'an

Recently, there has been a proliferation of fortune-tellers, divination practitioners, and palm readers on the streets of Xi'an. On both sides of the Xi'an Post and Telecommunications Building, there are stalls set up for computer fortune-telling, charging one to two yuan per session. In a corner of the Eight Immortals Temple, a young man with long hair eloquently interprets divination sticks for seekers, charging at least six jiao per session.

In reality, these fortune-tellers use the propagation of fatalism and idealism to deceive people and make money, while those seeking divination are essentially paying for lies. This phenomenon is contrary to the development of modern society. It is hoped that relevant departments in the local area will take action according to regulations and policies to rectify this situation.

### 西安街头算命抽签看相多

　　西安街头算命抽签看相多
    最近，在西安市街头摆摊算命、抽签、看相的很多。市邮电大楼两侧的商亭外，设有电脑算命，算命一次要付一到二元钱。八仙庵殿堂一角，一个留长发的男青年口若悬河地为求签人破译释签，一次最少收六角钱。
    其实，算命者是通过宣扬宿命论、唯心论来骗钱，求签者是拿钱买谎言。这种现象，有悖于现代社会的发展，希望当地有关部门根据法规、政策加以整顿。
