On the evening of March 17th, around 7:30 PM, my father was riding his bicycle near the Dadu Hotel on Beijing's Chegongzhuang Street when he was hit by a motor vehicle and fell to the ground, losing consciousness. The driver fled the scene. A kind-hearted passerby called over four traffic police officers. Seeing that my father was seriously injured, they immediately transported him to the Xuanwu Hospital for emergency treatment, while also trying to notify his family and staying with him in the hospital overnight. When we arrived at the hospital upon hearing the news, these four police officers gave us a detailed account of the situation before leaving. We repeatedly asked them to leave their names and unit, but they replied, “This is what we should do.” Eventually, they reluctantly told us that they were from the Xizhimen Outer Traffic Squad, with their squad leader surnamed Qi, and instructed us to take good care of the patient.

Thanks to the rescue efforts of the medical staff at Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, my father has now recovered and been discharged.

Our entire family sincerely thanks these four kind-hearted traffic police officers, the medical staff who saved lives and helped the injured, and the kind-hearted passerby. At the same time, we condemn the heartless driver who caused the accident. Beijing City, China Construction Technology Development Center, Li Qing

    交通事故后幸遇热心人
    3月17日晚7时半左右，我父亲骑车行至北京车公庄大街大都饭店附近时，被一辆机动车撞倒在地，神智不清。司机肇事后逃之夭夭。一位好心的过路人叫来4位交通民警。他们见我父亲伤势很重，立即用车将我父亲护送到宣武医院抢救，一面设法通知家属，并在医院守护了一夜。当我们闻讯赶到医院，这4位交通警向我们详细介绍了情况后便要离去。我们再三请他们留下姓名和单位，但回答是：“这是我们应当做的。”后来，在推托不了的情况下，只告诉他们是西直门外交通中队的，队长姓齐，嘱咐我们好好照料病人。
    经过北京宣武医院医护人员抢救，我父亲现已康复出院了。
    我们全家衷心感谢这4位热心助人的交通民警、救死扶伤的医护人员和好心的过路人，同时谴责那个不讲良心的肇事司机。北京市中国建筑技术发展中心  李青
