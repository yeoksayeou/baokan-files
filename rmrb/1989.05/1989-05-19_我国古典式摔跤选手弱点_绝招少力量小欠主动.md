Title: Weaknesses of Chinese Greco-Roman Wrestlers: Few Tricks, Low Strength, Lack of Initiative

After participating in previous international Greco-Roman wrestling competitions, many coaches have pointed out the issue of our athletes' monotonous techniques. This year, during the Swedish Vasteras Invitational and the Bulgarian Petrov Invitational, the Chinese team revealed weaknesses such as the lack of personal signature moves and the inability to adapt to the high-level demands of real-world competition.

In reality, only a few athletes in the Chinese team can be said to have specialized techniques. For example, Hu Rìzhā has a signature move of inserting and flipping, which is effective against both strong and weak opponents. However, most athletes lack specialized techniques in high-level competitions and do not have fixed signature moves. They often "adapt as they go," grabbing whatever they can. The root cause is that during regular training, they have not developed one or two signature moves based on their individual strengths, relying instead on general techniques during competitions.

During matches, our athletes' absolute strength is clearly inferior to their opponents. Due to the use of small weights and high repetitions in strength training, it is not conducive to significantly increasing absolute strength and enhancing competitive power during confrontations.

Observations show that our athletes are not accustomed to aggressive, offensive tactics during competitions. In the processes of grabbing, holding, and hugging, they often do not dare to push forward and frequently retreat, breaking contact. This not only gives the opponent opportunities to execute moves but also easily results in being penalized for passivity. In both international invitational tournaments, whether our team members were scoring or losing points, the first passive warning was always given to the Chinese athletes. The reason for this situation is that training lacks in-depth research on holding positions and does not treat it as a technique to be practiced. Even if there is practice, the athletes' goals are unclear.

### 我国古典式摔跤选手弱点  绝招少力量小欠主动

　　我国古典式摔跤选手弱点    
    绝招少力量小欠主动
    在以往参加国际古典式摔跤比赛后，许多教练员都提到我国运动员技术单调的问题。今年，中国队在瑞典韦斯特罗斯邀请赛和保加利亚佩特罗夫邀请赛上，暴露出没有形成个人绝招动作、不能适应这种世界高水平的实战需要的弱点。
    实际上，中国队只有少数运动员可以称得上有特长技术，像呼日查有个惯用的插掀动作，无论强手还是弱手，多少都要吃他这一招。而其他多数运动员在高水平的竞争中根本谈不上有特长技术，恰恰是没有固定的绝招技术。他们往往“随机应变”，抓住什么是什么。根本原因在于平时训练中没能根据个人特点练就一两个绝招，比赛中仅靠一般化的技术。
    比赛中，我国运动员的绝对力量明显低于对手。由于平时力量训练采用小重量、多次数的方法，不利于大幅度提高绝对力量，在对抗中增加实力。
    据观察，我国运动员在比赛中往往不习惯对攻型的抢夺，在抢夺、把持和搂抱过程中，不敢顶上，常常后退，脱离接触。这样一方面容易给对手使用动作的机会，同时容易被判罚消极。两次国际邀请赛中，无论在我方队员得分还是失分的情况下，第一次消极警告总是判给中国选手。造成这种情况的原因是训练中对把位研究不透，没有将其作为一种技术来练，即便有练习，运动员目的性也不明确。
