Premier Li Peng said today that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is not directed against any third country. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will not only have a positive impact on the Asia-Pacific region but will also influence the process of world peace and global stability.

Li Peng made these remarks this afternoon after his talks with Soviet leader Gorbachev, when he was interviewed by Soviet journalists accompanying Gorbachev on his visit to China and by Soviet journalists stationed in Beijing.

A Soviet journalist asked Li Peng, "What changes will occur in the relations between the Soviet Union, the United States, and China after the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations?"

Li Peng replied, "The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is not directed against any third country. China and the United States have relatively good relations. Moreover, the development of this relationship has been relatively stable. Of course, it is not that Sino-American relations have no problems at all. American officials have repeatedly expressed their welcome for the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. The United States is so large, and the entire Western world has so many people, that it is not possible to say that everyone is pleased with the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations. However, the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is in line with the global trend of détente. Everyone who wishes for peace, development, and peace and development in the world should welcome this."

Another Soviet journalist asked Li Peng to comment on his evaluation of the talks with Gorbachev and his impressions of meeting with the Soviet leader. Li Peng said, "I think the talks were very good and were conducted in a friendly and candid atmosphere. We discussed issues related to international relations and bilateral relations. On these issues, we have many similar or close views. There are also some differing views, but this is very natural. The most valuable thing is to exchange these differing views, which increases mutual understanding."

Li Peng said that he has a good impression of the new Soviet leadership. He said, "I think they are candid and willing to develop friendly relations with China. I feel that they are very knowledgeable about world affairs and, compared to previous Soviet leaders, are more frank and flexible." When discussing the prospects for the development of Sino-Soviet relations after the high-level meeting, Li Peng said, "After the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union, Sino-Soviet relations will enter a new stage. Deng Xiaoping summed up this meeting in eight words: 'End the past, open the future.' The relationship between China and the Soviet Union has been normalized. In the future, relations in various fields will be further developed. Li Peng emphasized that this relationship is different from the alliance relationship between China and the Soviet Union in the 1950s. Because this alliance relationship is not in the interests of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, nor is it in line with the current global trend. Sino-Soviet relations will develop into friendly and neighborly relations. He said, 'We will handle relations between China and the Soviet Union according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.'"

A journalist asked, "Did the talks with Gorbachev touch upon the issue of reducing military confrontation along the Sino-Soviet border?" Li Peng said, "The talks did touch upon this issue. I am very pleased to learn that the Soviet Union has announced the withdrawal of three-quarters of its troops from Mongolia. The Soviet side also expressed its intention to withdraw all troops from Mongolia, but it still needs to consult with the Mongolian side. China appreciates this. He said, 'We also discussed the issue of reducing military confrontation between the two sides. Although there are still many details to be discussed, both sides have expressed their intention to take a positive attitude towards this issue.'"

A journalist asked, "What significance will the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations have for the Asia-Pacific region, especially for the normalization of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region?" Li Peng said, "The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will not only have a positive impact on the Asia-Pacific region but will also influence the process of world peace and global stability. Li Peng said, 'Both sides have agreed that after the entire talks are concluded, we will issue a joint statement on the results of the talks. The journalists will be able to obtain very accurate information about the achievements of the talks from the statement. The journalists can evaluate the impact of this meeting based on the statement.'"

　　李鹏接受苏联记者采访时说    
    中苏关系正常化有世界意义
    新华社北京５月１６日电（记者辛怀时）国务院总理今天在这里说，中苏关系正常化不是针对任何第三国的。中苏关系正常化的意义不仅仅是对亚太地区产生积极影响，并将会对世界和平的进程、对世界的稳定都会产生影响。
    李鹏是今天下午在同苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫会谈后，接受随同戈尔巴乔夫来访的苏联记者和苏联常驻北京记者的采访时说这番话的。
    一位苏联记者问李鹏：“苏联、美国、中国之间的关系在中苏关系正常化以后将会出现一些什么变化？”
    李鹏回答说，中苏关系正常化不是针对任何第三国的。中国和美国有着比较好的关系。而且这个关系的发展是比较稳定的。当然也不是说中美两国关系没有任何问题。美国官方人士一再表示他们欢迎中苏关系正常化。美国这么大，西方整个世界这么多人，不能说完全没有人不欢喜中苏关系正常化。但是中苏关系正常化符合世界缓和的潮流。一切愿意和平、愿意发展、愿意世界取得和平与发展的人应该对此表示欢迎。
    一位苏联记者请李鹏谈谈他对同戈尔巴乔夫会谈的评价以及同苏联领导人的会见的印象。李鹏说，他认为这个会谈很好，是在友好的、坦诚的气氛中进行的。他说，“我们谈的题目是国际关系问题和双边关系问题。我们在这些问题上有许多相同或近似的观点。也还存在一些不一致的观点，但这也是很自然的。最可贵的是把这些不同的观点都交换出来，增进了相互之间的了解。”
    李鹏说，他对苏联新领导人的印象很好。他说，“我认为他们是坦诚的，是愿意发展中苏友好关系的。我感觉他们对世界事务是很了解的，和以前的苏联领导人比较起来更加坦率、更加灵活。”在谈到高级会晤后中苏关系的发展前景时，李鹏说，中苏高级会晤后，中苏关系将进入一个新的阶段。他说，邓小平同志用８个字概括这次会晤：结束过去、开辟未来。中国和苏联的关系已经正常化了。今后在各个领域的关系将得到进一步的发展。李鹏强调指出，这种关系和５０年代中苏的结盟关系不同。因为这种结盟关系既不符合中苏人民的利益，也不符合当今世界的潮流。中苏关系会发展成为友好的睦邻关系。他说，“我们将按照和平共处五项原则来处理中苏之间的关系。”
    苏联记者问“在和戈尔巴乔夫的会谈中是否涉及到了在中苏边境减少军队对峙水平的问题？”李鹏说，会谈涉及到了这个问题。他说，他很高兴地得知，苏联已宣布从蒙古撤军３／４。苏方在会谈中也表示了要从蒙古全部撤军的意向，但它还要和蒙古方面商谈。中国对此表示赞赏。他说，“我们同时也谈了减少双方军事对峙的问题。虽然这个问题还有许多细节问题需要讨论，但双方都表示了这个意向，要采取积极态度对待这个问题。”
    一记者问：“苏中关系正常化对亚太地区，特别是对亚太地区局势的健康化将具有什么意义？”李鹏说，中苏关系正常化的意义不仅仅是对亚太地区产生积极影响，并将会对世界和平的进程、对世界的稳定都会产生影响。李鹏说，“双方已经商定，我们整个会谈结束以后，要把会谈结果发表一个联合公报。各位记者将会从公报里面就整个会谈取得了一些什么成果得到非常准确的信息。各位记者可以根据公报来评价这次会谈将产生一些什么影响。”
