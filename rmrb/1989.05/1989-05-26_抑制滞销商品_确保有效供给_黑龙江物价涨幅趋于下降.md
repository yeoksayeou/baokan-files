		Curbing Oversupply of Unsold Goods to Ensure Effective Supply: Black Dragon River Province's Price Increases Showing a Downward Trend

	Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 26th - (Reporter: Gu Wanming) Black Dragon River Province has, since this year, adopted a policy of economic restructuring to ensure effective supply, leading to a month-by-month decrease in price increases.

	Black Dragon River Province has, since the beginning of this year, focused on 383 types of goods that are closely related to people's lives, adjusting the economic structure. For relevant industries, from electricity, raw materials, funds, and other aspects, they have been given strong support. This has led the economic restructuring to develop in the direction of curbing the oversupply of unsold goods and increasing the production of marketable goods, stabilizing and reducing the trend of price increases.

	In the first four months of this year, the province's light industry output value increased by 15.5% compared to the same period last year, and heavy industry output value increased by 4.1%. The growth of light industry output value far exceeds that of heavy industry, and the market supply of goods is sufficient. In the first four months of this year, the province saw a trend of month-by-month decrease in price increases. The price increase in April was 2.5 percentage points lower than in March and 5.6 percentage points lower than in January. The price of agricultural production materials in April was 8.8 percentage points lower than in January. The province's price increase in the first four months was lower than the national average.
