	With five key indicators, the significant achievements of China's high-temperature superconductivity research over nearly two years have been evaluated. Currently, China's superconductivity research remains at the forefront of the world.

	In the most critical aspect of increasing the critical current density of superconducting materials, the critical current density of China's yttrium-based superconducting materials has reached 6,000 amperes per square centimeter.

	In the application of superconducting thin films, which is crucial for practical use, the critical current density of domestic yttrium-based superconducting thin films has reached 10 million amperes per square centimeter. The process repeatability and film stability are both quite good.

	In weak magnetic measurements, the sensitivity of domestically developed radio frequency superconducting quantum interference devices in measuring magnetic fields has reached 0.000000002 gauss, successfully detecting the subtle changes in human muscle currents that are extremely difficult to measure.

	Notably, China has recently discovered bismuth-lead-antimony-strontium-calcium-copper-oxide superconductors with zero-resistance temperatures of 132 K (-141 degrees Celsius) and 164 K (-109 degrees Celsius), setting a new world record for superconducting critical temperatures.

	In addition, in the structural and mechanistic research of high critical temperature superconductors, China has made significant progress in the superconducting properties, single-phase single-crystal preparation, crystal structure, microstructural, transport properties, and magnetic flux pinning of superconducting materials, deepening the understanding of these areas.

	The State Science and Technology Commission believes that to achieve substantial progress in the practical application of superconductivity research, the tasks ahead are still arduous. The state will further concentrate on targets, organize forces, and strengthen breakthrough efforts. It will deepen basic research and academic guidance, optimize technical routes, and accelerate research progress. Some projects have already been agreed upon and implemented. Attention should also be paid to exploring research with near-term application prospects, focusing on superconductivity applications in microwave technology and microelectronics. There should be a focus on supporting the application development research of low-temperature superconductivity in the liquid nitrogen temperature range, aiming to achieve breakthroughs in this temperature range with practical significance. At the same time, active international exchanges and cooperation should be carried out, proactively seeking to establish cooperative relationships with some countries.

　　以五项指标评估两年攻关成效    
    我超导研究居世界前列   
    国家将优化技术路线加快研究步伐
    新华社北京５月９日电  （记者卓培荣）记者从国家科委了解到，我国组织高温超导攻关将近两年来，超导研究工作已经取得显著成效。从五个主要指标看，目前我国的超导研究水平仍然处于世界前列。
    在目前最关键的提高超导材料临界电流密度方面，我国钇系超导体材料的临界电流密度已达到每平方厘米６０００安培。
    在应用方面至关重要的超导薄膜研究上，国内的钇系超导薄膜临界电流密度达到每平方厘米１００万安培，工艺重复性和膜的稳定性都相当好。
    在弱磁测量上，国内研制的射频超导量子干涉器件测量磁场的灵敏度达到亿分之二高斯，已经测量到极难测到的人体肌肉电流的变化值。
    特别是，我国最近发现了零电阻温度为１３２Ｋ（－１４１摄氏度）和１６４Ｋ（－１０９摄氏度）的铋铅锑锶钙铜氧超导体，创造了超导临界温度世界记录。
    同时，在高临界温度超导体的结构和机理研究方面，我国在超导材料的超导电性、单相单晶制备、晶体结构、显微组织、输运性质和磁通钉扎等方面研究都做出了很有意义的工作，认识层次深化了。
    国家科委认为，为了在超导研究的实际应用方面取得实质性的进展，今后面临的任务仍很艰巨。国家将进一步集中目标，组织力量，强化攻关。将深入开展基础研究和学术引导工作，优化技术路线，加快研究步伐，目前已商定和落实了一些课题。还要注意开拓近期有应用前景的研究工作，抓紧在微波技术和微电子学中的超导应用研究。要有重点地支持低温超导液氮温区的应用开发研究，争取在这一温区有现实意义的研究上取得突破。同时，要积极主动地开展国际交流与合作，主动争取与一些国家建立合作关系。
