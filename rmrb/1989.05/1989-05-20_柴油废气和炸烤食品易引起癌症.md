Diesel exhaust and fried food can cause cancer

Xinhua News Agency, Helsinki, May 17th - American and Japanese environmental experts announced at an international conference on carcinogens in Finland that diesel exhaust and high-temperature cooked foods can cause cancer.

American scholar Stephen Nesnow's experiments showed that the carcinogenic effects of diesel exhaust are equivalent to those of coal tar. People who are forced to inhale diesel exhaust in their work will see a significant increase in lung cancer cases.

Japanese scholar Takashi Sugimura discovered a new type of heterocyclic compound in fried foods, which has carcinogenic mutagens. Since the concentration of mutagens increases dramatically with temperature, high temperatures should be avoided when frying or grilling food.

According to materials released by the conference, 80% of cancers are caused by environmental factors. Currently, more than half of the chemicals used commercially worldwide are confirmed or suspected to cause cancer.

　　柴油废气和炸烤食品易引起癌症
    新华社赫尔辛基５月１７日电  美国和日本的环境学专家在芬兰举行的致癌物国际讨论会上宣布，柴油废气和炸烤等高温食品会引起癌变。
    美国学者谢费恩·内斯诺的实验证明，柴油废气的致癌作用与煤焦油相等，因工作不得不吸入柴油废气的人中将会出现大批肺癌病人。
    日本学者杉村高志从烤炸食品中发现了一种新的杂环型物质，其中的诱变剂具有致癌作用。由于诱变剂含量随温度升高而急剧增加，所以在炸、烤食品时应忌用高温。
    据大会公布的有关材料，８０％的癌症是因环境因素引起的。目前世界上用于商业的化学制品中一半以上肯定或可能引起癌变。
