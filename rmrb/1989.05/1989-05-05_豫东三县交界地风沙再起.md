Now, the villagers in the border area of Minquan, Suixian, and Ningling counties in Henan are swallowing the bitter fruit they have created themselves. Due to their destruction of the windbreak and sand-fixing forests in this area, wind and sand have once again ravaged the region over the past two years. Sand dunes that were previously controlled are now spreading in all directions, affecting some farmland. The residents of more than ten villages in the border area of the above three counties are severely affected.

According to investigations, before 1984, the forestry departments of the three counties organized the masses to plant 4,000 mu of windbreak and sand-fixing forests. Now, more than 70% of the trees have been illegally logged. Among them, the forest belt in Yan Zhuang Forest Farm in Bopai Township, Minquan County, has been the most severely damaged, with 95% of the trees destroyed. Previously, this area was shaded by dense trees. Now, large areas of forests have disappeared.

The reason for the misfortune of the windbreak forests is as follows: someone planted them but no one managed them; the forestry contract method was not appropriate, the purpose was unclear, and the contractors cut down the trees at will; illegal logging was rampant, and most villagers in the border area believed that the trees would eventually be stolen by outsiders, so they might as well cut them down early; the trend of rural housing construction is on the rise, leading to a sharp increase in the amount of timber cut.

It is suggested that the relevant departments of the three counties take immediate measures to rescue the windbreak and sand-fixing forests that are on the brink of extinction.

　　豫东三县交界地风沙再起
    现在，河南民权、睢县、宁陵３县交界地区的村民们正在吞咽自己酿成的“苦果”。
    由于他们破坏了这里的防风固沙林，近两年来风沙再度肆虐这一地区。原先已得到控制的沙丘正向四处扩延，并殃及到部分农田，居住在以上３县交界地区的十几个村庄的群众深受其害。
    据调查，１９８４年前，３县林业部门曾组织群众种了４０００亩防风固沙林，现在已有７０％以上的林木被盗伐。其中，民权县伯党乡阎庄林场林带遭破坏最为严重，林木被毁达９５％。以前这里是林荫蔽日，满目葱茏。如今，大片林木荡然无存。
    防风林带惨遭厄运的原因是：有人栽无人管，林业承包方法欠妥，目的不明，承包者随意砍伐；盗伐严重，交界地区多数村民认为，树迟早让外人偷去，不如自己早点砍掉；农村建房风日盛，使林木采伐量剧增。
    建议３县有关部门尽快采取措施，挽救濒临绝境的防风固沙林。
