The Mudanjiang Municipal Tax Bureau in Heilongjiang Province has strengthened the management of scattered taxes by extending their reach and controlling tax sources. This has yielded significant results. By the end of the first quarter of this year, a total of 165.2 million yuan in scattered taxes had been collected, an increase of 50% compared to the same period last year.

To strengthen the management of scattered taxes and plug loopholes, the city has broken away from the past practice of having a single sub-bureau manage all scattered taxes. In urban areas, tax management has been extended to street offices, and in rural areas, to villages. This has expanded the coverage. Currently, 19 street offices in the city have established tax offices with the participation of local organizations such as street committees and residents' committees. They have formulated tax cooperation systems and reward systems for public reporting of tax sources.

After extending the tax management reach, three benefits have been achieved: first, many professional households have been brought under public supervision, making management easier; second, it has compensated for the lack of management personnel, and some hidden tax evaders have been uncovered; third, it has widened the monitoring network and information network. In the Xian'an District, a co-taxation officer from the Xianfeng Street Office discovered that a hair salon, which had reported closure, reopened without declaring it. The information was immediately fed back to the tax office. The tax office conducted a follow-up inspection and recovered 540 yuan in taxes.

They have also established a railway tax office to address the issue of tax evasion through procurement channels. The number of dedicated staff has increased from 1 to 11, effectively plugging loopholes in wholesale and procurement.

　　延伸触角　控制税源    
    牡丹江强化零散税征管
    本报讯  黑龙江省牡丹江市税务局从延伸征管触角、加强税源控制等方面入手，加强对零散税收的征管工作，收到显著效果。截至今年一季度末，共实现零散税收１６５．２万元，比去年同期提高５０％。
    为了加强零散税收的征管工作，堵塞漏洞，该市打破了过去由一个分局统管零散税收的局面，在城市把税收征管触角延伸到街道办事处，农村延伸到村屯，从而扩大覆盖面。目前，市区已在１９个办事处建立由街道和居民委等地方组织参加的税务所，制订了协税制度和群众举报税源有奖制度。
    税收征管触角延伸后，一是把众多专业户一举推入群众的监护视线里，便于管理；二是弥补了征管力量不足，一些隐蔽的漏户先后被清了出来；三是拓宽了监控网络和信息网络。西安区先锋办事处一协税员发现有一报停的烫发店在未申报的情况下重新开张，便立即将信息反馈给税务所。税务所跟踪检查，查补税款５４０元。
    他们针对以往进货渠道漏税多的情况，成立了铁路税务所，专管员由１人增加到１１人，基本上堵住了批发、进货中的漏洞。
