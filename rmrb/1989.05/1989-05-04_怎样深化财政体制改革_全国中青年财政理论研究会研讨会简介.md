In mid-April, the National Mid-Young Financial Theory Research Association held an expanded meeting of permanent members in Beijing. Participants fully affirmed the achievements made during the rectification and adjustment period, but also noted that current problems remain severe, especially structural contradictions, irrational use of funds, declining economic efficiency, and the lack of clear signs of price stabilization. This makes the fiscal situation even more grim. Participants believe that currently, it is particularly important to strengthen the coordination and unity of various rectification measures and policies, and to prevent conflicting directives.

Delegates pointed out that fiscal policy is an important means of national economic regulation, and it should prioritize ensuring economic and social stability. (1) Further improve the enterprise contract responsibility system, and promptly introduce tax and profit sharing, reform pre-tax loan repayments, streamline enterprise management mechanisms, and address the current issues of managing and reforming through contracts. (2) Reform the fiscal contract system. On the basis of rationalizing price mechanisms and clarifying the powers and financial responsibilities of governments at all levels, implement a tax-sharing system to stabilize the distribution relationship between the central and local governments. Gradually increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue in the process of economic and political system reform. (3) Based on China's national conditions, improve the existing tax system, reform budget compilation and management, and enhance the fiscal macro-control function. (4) Accelerate the process of fiscal legislation, legalize financial and tax inspections, and incorporate fiscal supervision into daily economic life.

　　怎样深化财政体制改革    
    ——全国中青年财政理论研究会研讨会简介
    本报讯四月中旬，全国中青年财政理论研究会在北京召开在京常务干事扩大会议。大家充分肯定了治理整顿业已取得的成绩，但也认为，目前的问题仍很严重，特别是结构性矛盾突出，资金运用不合理，经济效益下降以及市场物价上涨势头回落不明显等，这使财政面临的形势更为严峻。大家认为，当前要特别强化各种治理手段和政策间协调统一，杜绝政出多门。
    与会同志指出，财政是国家调控经济的重要手段，财政政策要把保证经济与社会的稳定放在第一位。（１）进一步完善企业承包制，尽快择时推出税利分流、改革税前还贷，理顺企业经营机制，解决目前以包代管、以包代改的问题。（２）改革财政包干体制，要在理顺价格机制、明确各级政府事权与财权的基础上，实行分税制，稳定中央和地方的分配关系；在经济和政治体制改革中，逐步提高财政收入占国民收入的比重，提高中央财政收入占国家财政收入的比重。（３）从我国国情出发，完善现行税制，改革预算的编制与管理，增强财政的宏观调控功能。（４）加快财政立法的进程，把财务、税收大检查法制化，将财政监督寓于日常经济生活之中。
