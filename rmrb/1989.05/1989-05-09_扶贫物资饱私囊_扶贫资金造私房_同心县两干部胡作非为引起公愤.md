In the region known as "the poorest in China," Western Ningxia, a recent scandal has emerged: Tongxin County's Rural Construction Office Director, Ma Zongguo, and Deputy Director, Ma Yingdi, have blatantly misused state funds allocated for poverty alleviation to build private homes and sell relief supplies for personal gain. As a result, several poverty alleviation projects in the county have been halted, and the poverty alleviation plan has not been implemented.

This incident has sparked public outrage among officials and residents in the Western Ningxia region. It is reported that the investigation into this case has encountered resistance from certain quarters. Ma Yingdi and others have been actively seeking support, instructing twenty-one people to provide false testimony (including five at the section chief level), and fabricating lists of people who received relief supplies, with some individuals signing for three or four people.

According to reports, in June 1988, Ma Zongguo and Ma Yingdi took advantage of the construction of auxiliary facilities for the county's agricultural technology training center to build two rows of eight brick-and-wood houses in the county seat, with a total construction cost of 45,551 yuan. After the houses were completed, the two divided the four houses in the back row into two, built a partition wall in the middle, and constructed two brick-and-wood kitchens (totaling 80 square meters) in the courtyard. Each built an eight-square-meter flower bed, dug a cement water well, and constructed a 40-meter red brick wall, installing iron gates separately, turning public housing into private residences.

The State Council's "Three Westerns Office" allocated a batch of timber and steel for relocation and economic development. Last year, 860 cubic meters of timber were allocated to Tongxin County, of which 320 cubic meters were diverted or sold at high prices by Ma Zongguo and Ma Yingdi. Subsequently, Tongxin County requested an additional 150 cubic meters of timber for 2,190 impoverished households to build houses, which was also embezzled by them.

　　扶贫物资饱私囊
    扶贫资金造私房
    同心县两干部胡作非为引起公愤
    新华社银川五月九日电  （宁夏日报记者马和亮、新华社记者师海波）在被称为“中国贫困之冠”的宁夏西海固地区，近来揭发出一件怪事：同心县负责扶贫工作的农村建设办公室主任马宗国、副主任马英迪，公然动用国务院拨发的“三西”扶贫专款营造私房，倒卖扶贫物资牟取暴利，致使这个县的一些扶贫项目无法实施，扶贫计划无法落实。
    这件事在西海固地区干部群众中引起公愤。据悉，此案的查处工作遇到来自一些方面的阻力。马英迪等人则四出活动，先后授意二十一人为他们出具伪证（其中科级干部五人），并编造了多人领取扶贫物资的花名册，有的一人竟冒充三四个人签名。
    据介绍，一九八八年六月，马宗国、马英迪借建造县农业技术培训中心附属设施之机，在县城建造两排共八间砖木结构瓦房，总造价为四万五千五百五十一元。房子建成后，二人将后排四间一分为二，中间砌上隔墙，在院子里各盖起砖木结构伙房两间（共八十平方米）。各砌八平方米花坛一座，打水泥水窖一眼，并砌起红砖围墙四十米，分别安装了铁门，使公房变成了私人住宅。
    国务院“三西办”为扶持搬迁和经济开发，专项下达了一批木材、钢材。去年下拨给同心县八百六十立方米木材，其中三百二十立方米被马宗国、马英迪批作他用或高价倒卖。之后，同心县以二千一百九十户贫困农民急需木材盖房为由请求上级增拨的一百五十立方米木材，也被他们侵吞。
