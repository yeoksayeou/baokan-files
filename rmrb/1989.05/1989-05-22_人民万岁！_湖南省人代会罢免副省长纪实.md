At around 5 PM on May 15, the Hunan Provincial Military Region Hall was filled with delegates of the second session of the seventh Hunan Provincial People's Congress. They were there to vote on a motion to dismiss Vice Governor Yang Huichuan, proposed by 177 delegates.

The delegates walked up to the ballot boxes one by one, solemnly exercising the sacred power granted to them by the constitution. The session had opened on May 5. On the afternoon of the 12th, in response to some delegates' requests, Vice Governor Yang Huichuan and officials from the Provincial Bureau of Industry and Commerce, the Provincial Audit Bureau, and the Provincial Foreign Economic Commission were questioned by the delegates. The delegates posed sharp questions about the issue of cleaning up and rectifying companies and inquired about the relevant situation regarding the cleanup of the Hunan International Economic Development Company. As the vice governor in charge of financial and foreign economic work, Yang Huichuan could only stammer and often seemed to know nothing about the delegates' questions. The delegates also sharply criticized him for the incident during the Canton Fair last spring, where the Hunan Huaxiang Company hosted a banquet at the Dongfang Hotel in Guangzhou, attended by Yang, his daughter, son-in-law, and others, costing 4,437.1 yuan. They also criticized him for his lack of significant results in cleaning up companies as the leader of the provincial company cleanup and rectification leading group.

Representatives from five cities and prefectures, including Changsha and Xiangtan, submitted a motion to the presidium to dismiss him from his post as vice governor. According to the relevant provisions of the Organic Law of the People's Congress, the presidium submitted the dismissal motion to the congress for a vote. At 5:40 PM, the presiding chairman of the presidium announced the voting results: 506 votes in favor of dismissal, 162 votes against, and 98 abstentions. The number of votes in favor exceeded half of the total number of delegates, and the dismissal motion was passed. The entire venue erupted in thunderous applause.

One delegate proudly said, "We are no longer rubber stamps, no longer just shaking hands, raising hands to vote, and clapping to pass resolutions." Many delegates could not help but shout:

"Long live the people!"

    长沙、湘潭等５个地、市代表团的１７７名代表向大会主席团提案要求罢免他的副省长职务。根据人大组织法有关规定，大会主席团将罢免案提交大会表决。５点４０，大会主席团执行主席宣布投票结果：赞成罢免的５０６票，反对罢免的１６２票，弃权9８票。赞成票超过全体代表的半数，通过了这一罢免案。顿时，整个会场爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。
    一位代表自豪地说，我们再也不是橡皮图章，再也不是见面握手，表决举手，通过拍手的“三手”代表了。许多代表情不自禁地高呼：
