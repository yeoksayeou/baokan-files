Fujian Province's Mingxi County has implemented a comprehensive service model involving the grain, supply, and agricultural bank departments to break the vicious cycle in agricultural supply. Since early March, over 440 officials and staff from these three departments have been dispatched to villages. They have been working to fulfill various tasks, including issuing pre-purchase deposits, distributing grain purchase reward tickets for fertilizers and diesel, and supplying fertilizers on-site, all in a coordinated "one-stop" service. This approach has effectively realized the "three-linked" policy.

This "one-stop" service has broken the vicious cycle and initiated a virtuous one. The grain department issues pre-purchase deposits and transfer vouchers, while the financial department recycles funds and issues loans.

By April 10th, 90% of Mingxi County's households had received pre-purchase deposits totaling over 1.25 million yuan. They had purchased 6,817 tons of fertilizer and 294 tons of diesel. The Agricultural Bank had recycled over 1.95 million yuan in funds, ensuring that all pre-purchase deposit and production material loan funds were fully recycled.

### 粮食金融等部门一齐下乡服务  明溪农资供应跳出“怪圈”

　　粮食金融等部门一齐下乡服务    
    明溪农资供应跳出“怪圈”
    本报福州５月１日电  记者张铭清报道：银根收紧，粮食部门缺乏货款难以兑现预购定金，只好给农民“打白条”；农民没钱购化肥，影响春耕生产；农资部门化肥压库，缺乏资金进货；化肥厂供货后收不回资金，生产难以为继——这样一个恶性循环，怎么打破？
    福建省明溪县从３月上旬开始组织粮食、供销、农行三个部门的４４０多名干部职工，深入到村，根据各乡镇合同定购任务，实行就地发放预购定金，就地发放定购粮食奖售化肥票和柴油票，就地开单供应化肥的“一条龙”配套综合服务，落实“三挂钩”政策。
    “一条龙”打破了恶性循环的怪圈，出现了良性循环。粮食部门发放预购定金开好转账支票，金融部门一边回笼资金，一边发放贷款。
    到４月１０日，明溪县９０％的农户拿到了预购定金１２５万多元，购买了化肥６８１７吨，柴油２９４吨，农行回笼货币１９５万多元，基本上做到了发放预购定金和生产资料的贷款资金全部回笼。
