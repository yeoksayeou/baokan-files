Recently, in many places in our area, young parents have been paying private doctors to give their infants "cowpox" vaccinations. These private doctors use the pus from people with sores to make their own vaccines, charging 5 yuan per vaccination. According to incomplete statistics, over 80% of infants who received the vaccination experienced adverse reactions, with mild cases showing redness, swelling, and pus at the injection site, and severe cases showing ulceration, fever, and loss of appetite. In our township's Ni Li Dian Village, a six-month-old infant developed a high fever three days after receiving the vaccination, with the injection site becoming infected with pus. Only after treatment at the health clinic did the infant's condition improve.

We suggest that relevant departments strengthen the promotion of health and epidemic prevention knowledge and take action against those private doctors who violate medical and health regulations, only seeking profit and harming children.

　　私人医生用疮痂自制假疫苗　婴幼儿接种“牛痘”花钱受罪
    最近一段时间，我们这里许多地方的年轻父母花钱找私人医生给小宝宝接种“牛痘”。这些私人医生用长疮病人的疮痂自制疫苗，种一个痘收费５元。据不完全统计，８０％以上的婴幼儿接种后有不良反应，轻者伤口红肿化脓，重者伤口溃烂，并伴有发烧、食欲不振等症状。我乡廿里店村一名半岁婴儿接种３天后连续高烧，伤口化脓，经卫生院治疗后才转危为安。
    建议有关部门加强卫生防疫知识的宣传，对那些违反医疗卫生法规，只为赚钱、祸及儿童的不法私人医生加以处理。
