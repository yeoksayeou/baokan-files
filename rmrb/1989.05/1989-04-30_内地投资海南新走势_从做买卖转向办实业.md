People's Daily, Hainan, April 30th. Reporter Luo Zisu reports: The shift from trading to industrial development is a new trend in mainland investment in Hainan. This year, out of the 231 mainland-invested enterprises approved and registered at the provincial level, 125 are engaged in industrial development, accounting for 54.1% of the total approved, with each investment amounting to over 10 million yuan.

In just one year, the basic infrastructure of Hainan, including energy, transportation, and communications, has significantly improved. Local regulations and implementation details for preferential policies have been successively issued, boosting the confidence of investors. Compared to last year, the number of mainland enterprises investing in Hainan has increased, with a notable rise in those focusing on industrial development. These industries are primarily concentrated in processing and manufacturing, as well as repair industries, which have small raw material transportation volumes but high product values, aiming to expand their market reach. The Hainan Provincial Overseas Economic and Trade Corporation and the Guangxi Hechi Smelting Plant have jointly registered an investment of 11 million yuan to build the Haihe United Smelting Plant in the old city industrial zone of Chengmai County. The first phase of the project is planned to produce 2,000 tons of antimony ingots annually, all of which will be exported.

    从做买卖转向办实业
    本报海口４月３０日电  记者罗自苏报道：从经营贸易转向兴办实业，这是内地在海南投资新走势。今年经省一级批准注册的２３１家内联企业中，兴办实业的为１２５家，占审批总数的５４．１％，投资额均在１００万元以上。
    一年奠基，海南的能源、交通、通讯等基础设施大为改善，落实优惠政策的地方法规和实施细则陆续出台，这使来海南投资者信心大增。与去年相比，今年来投资的内地企业见涨，兴实业的增加。这些实业主要集中于原料运输量小而产值可观的加工工业和制造、修理工业，旨在将产品向外拓展。由海南省海外经济贸易总公司和广西河池冶炼厂注册１１０万元在澄迈县老城工业区兴建的海河联合冶炼厂，首期工程准备年产２０００吨锑锭，产品全部外销。
