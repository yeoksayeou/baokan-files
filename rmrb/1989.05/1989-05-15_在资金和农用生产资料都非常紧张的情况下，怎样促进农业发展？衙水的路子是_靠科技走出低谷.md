A few years ago, agricultural production in our Hengshui region of Hebei seemed to have entered a "vicious cycle," stagnating year after year. Since 1985, we have relied on science and technology, adjusted the planting structure, and vigorously promoted material and scientific inputs to improve comparative benefits. With the help of science and technology, we have emerged from the agricultural development doldrums. In 1988, compared to 1987, the region saw four increases: grain production reached 1.495 billion kilograms, an increase of 350 million kilograms, setting a historical high; cotton production reached 118 million kilograms, a 13% increase; per capita income of farmers increased by 75 yuan; and the input-output ratio per mu increased from 1:17 to 1:28.

The 8.8 million mu of farmland in Hengshui region relies on 80% of production materials from outside the region each year, with an uncertain supply, and grain and cotton yields are not high. Especially when limited fertilizers, water, oil, and electricity are used evenly, the result is that good land is not "fed enough," while poor land is "fed" with little effect. Since 1985, we have adjusted the planting structure, using one-third of the good land to grow grain to increase yield and maintain total production; using medium to high-quality land to grow cotton and other economic crops; and using one-third of the saline, sandy, and barren land to plant forests, fruits, and grasses, engaging in development-oriented agricultural production. This layout emphasizes key areas, concentrating agricultural production materials on nearly 6 million mu of grain and cotton, while the remaining 3 million mu are planted with suitable crops, self-regulating and conserving soil fertility. Over the past three years, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu for grain and cotton production has increased by an average of about 5% per year. At the same time, we implemented preferential policies such as prioritizing electricity, oil supply, and well drilling for good land, achieving significant results. Last year, the grain planting area decreased by 40,000 mu compared to the previous year, but the yield per mu reached over 400 kilograms, an increase of over 200 kilograms compared to 1985. The more than 100,000 mu of saline-alkali land, once considered a heavy burden, has gradually become an asset. Since 1986, the region has successively planted over 700,000 mu of alfalfa and other grasses to improve saline-alkali land, developing animal husbandry. Each year, over 4 million rabbits and sheep are raised, and together with forage and green manure, an additional 70 million yuan is earned annually. The income per mu has increased from a few yuan to over 100 yuan. Planting grasses and raising livestock not only improve the saline-alkali soil, solving the problem of competing for fertilizer and water with grain and cotton crops, but also provide over 30 million yuan for developing grain production, such as drilling wells, repairing wells, and building anti-seepage pipelines.

After solving the problem of insufficient agricultural production materials, the next challenge was the price increases of the three major materials: fertilizer, diesel, and pesticides. Agricultural production input-output ratio decreased, and we had no power to control the price increases. The only solution was to focus on science and technology. In 1987, the region organized over 2,000 scientific and technical personnel and rural investigation teams to conduct a comprehensive survey and analysis of soil composition and farmers' input situations. It was found that the organic matter content in the soil had generally decreased, nitrogen fertilizer usage was high, phosphorus fertilizer usage was low, and there was waste in irrigation and pesticide spraying. This indicated that over the past few years, we had taken a detour in agricultural inputs, wasting a lot of money. By guiding farmers to make scientific inputs, we could absorb the price increase factors. The measures taken were: first, increase the use of organic fertilizer. The region allocated 150,000 tons of subsidized fertilizer, rewarding counties with more organic fertilizer. Last year, the region accumulated 236 million cubic meters of coarse fertilizer, an increase of over 30 million cubic meters compared to the previous year. Second, promote formula fertilization on a large scale. In 1988, formula fertilization was applied to 6.5 million mu, accounting for 76% of the planting area of the three major crops. The amount of fertilizer used decreased by 10% compared to previous years, and the nitrogen-phosphorus ratio increased significantly, with an average increase of 13 kilograms per mu. Third, guide farmers in scientific farming and comprehensive pest control. In 1988, the region replaced over 5 million mu of wheat and corn with high-quality varieties, actively promoting model cultivation. Last year, the region implemented biological control on 895,000 mu, saving 900,000 yuan in pesticide costs alone. According to the agricultural department, in 1988, the input per mu in cash terms decreased by 5% compared to 1987, and the comparative benefit increased by 10%.

    在资金和农用生产资料都非常紧张的情况下，怎样促进农业发展？衙水的路子是——
　　靠科技走出低谷
    平义杰    
    前几年，我们河北衡水地区的农业生产，仿佛进入了一个“怪圈”，连年徘徊不前。１９８５年以来，我们依靠科学技术，调整种植结构，狠抓物质投入和科学投入，提高比较效益，借助科技之梯，走出了农业发展的低谷。１９８８年与１９８７年相比，全区出现了４个增长：粮食总产达１４．９５亿公斤，增产３．５亿多公斤，创历史最高水平；棉花总产１．１８亿公斤，增产１３％；农民人均收入增加７５元；亩投入产出比由１∶１７上升到１∶２８。
    衡水地区８８０万亩农田，每年所用的生产资料８０％来自外地，供应无保障，粮棉产量不高。特别是把有限的肥、水、油、电平均使用，结果是好地“吃不饱”，赖地“吃”了增产效果不明显，从１９８５年开始，我们调整了种植业结构，用１／３的好地种粮，提高单产保总产；中等偏上的地种棉花为主的经济作物；１／３的碱、沙荒地种植林、果、草，搞开发性农业生产。这样布局，突出重点，将农业生产资料集中用在近６００万亩的粮棉上，其余的３００万亩种植适宜生长的作物，自我调节，涵养地力。３年来粮棉生产亩施化肥量平均每年递增５％左右。与此同时实施对好地先上电、多供油、优先打井等倾斜政策，取得了明显的效益。去年全区粮食种植面积比上年减少４万亩。亩产达到了４００多公斤，比１９８５年增长２００多公斤。过去被视为沉重包袱的１００多万亩盐碱地也逐渐变成了财富。自１９８６年以来，全区陆续种植以苜蓿为主的抗碱改良土地的牧草７０多万亩，发展畜牧业，每年兔羊出栏４００多万只，加上饲草绿肥，每年可增收７０００多万元，亩收入由原来的几元、十几元上升到１００多元。种草养畜不仅改良了盐碱地土壤，解决了与粮棉作物争肥争水的问题，而且还为发展粮食生产提供了打机井、修机井、修防渗管道资金３０００多万元。
    解决了农业生产资料少的困难后，随之而来的就是化肥、柴油、农药三大类物资的涨价风，农业生产投入产出下降，要控制涨价，我们无能为力，唯一办法是从科学技术上打主意。１９８７年，全区组织２０００多名科技人员和农村调查队对土壤成份和农民的投入情况进行了普查和分析，发现土壤中有机质含量普遍减少，氮肥使用量多，磷肥用量少，浇水和农药喷洒上存在浪费现象。这说明，几年来我们在农业投入上走了弯路，花了不少冤枉钱。正确引导农民进行科学投入，就能把涨价因素消化掉。采取的措施是：首先，增施有机肥，地区拿出１５００吨平价化肥，对积有机肥多的县给予奖励。去年全区共积粗肥２３６０万立方米，比上年增加了３００多万立方米。其次，大面积推广配方施肥。１９８８年配方施肥６５０万亩，占三大作物种植面积的７６％，化肥施用量比往年减少了１０％，氮磷比例有较大幅度提高，平均亩增产１３％。再次，指导农民科学种田和综合防治病虫害。１９８８年全区更换优良品种，积极推广了５００多万亩的小麦、玉米模式化栽培。去年全区搞了８９．５万亩的生物防治，仅此一项就节约农药费９０万元。据农业部门测算，１９８８年亩投入折合现金比１９８７年减少５％，比较效益提高了１０％。 　　　　　　　　（作者为河北省衡水地委书记）
