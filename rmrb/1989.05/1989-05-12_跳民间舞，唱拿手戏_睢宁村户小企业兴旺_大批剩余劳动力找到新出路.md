The People's Daily reports: Village, community, and household enterprises in various townships of Suining County, Jiangsu Province, are flourishing. So far this year, more than 110,000 workers in the county are employed in "non-polluting," electricity-free factories, with 65,000 of them working in "family factories," an increase of more than 20,000 compared to the same period last year.

According to the New China Daily: Suining County's township enterprises are relatively weak, and a large number of surplus laborers urgently need to find new opportunities. The county committee and government considered that industrial development is constrained by funding and energy, while the county's abundant natural resources have not been fully utilized, and there is still much room for development in traditional sideline industries. Therefore, they took measures to encourage farmers to gather idle funds and focus on developing village and community small enterprises and household industries, "dancing folk dances and performing signature plays."

The county and township governments assigned a responsible person to help farmers come up with ideas and solutions, invite experts to provide guidance, organize production, and manage sales. Guiping Town is famous for its reed grass, and each village weaves reed bags, reed shoes, reed mats, and reed grass fans. Guanshan, Lanshan, and Zhangwei Townships use local materials to mine stones. Wangji, Yaoji, and Zhuji Townships process willow weaving crafts, with the main production base in the townships, and each household is a processing workshop. In Pan Village, Suicheng Township, the wool sweater factory uses manual machinery and is basically not constrained by electricity. Wool sweaters are popular in the market, and this factory added 40 more looms at the end of last year, arranging for an additional 80 surplus laborers.

　　“跳民间舞，唱拿手戏”   
    睢宁村户小企业兴旺    
    大批剩余劳动力找到新出路
    本报讯  江苏省睢宁县各乡镇的村、组、户办企业蓬勃兴起，今年以来，全县有１１万多名劳力在“不冒烟”、不用电的工厂做工，其中“家庭工厂”的从业人数达６．５万人，比去年同期增加２万多人。
    据新华日报报道：睢宁县乡镇企业比较薄弱，大批剩余劳力急需寻求出路。县委、县政府考虑到兴办工业受资金、能源制约，而本县丰富的自然资源尚未充分利用，传统的工副业还有很多发展余地，便采取措施鼓励农民筹集闲散资金，重点发展村组小企业和户办工业，“跳民间舞，唱拿手戏”。
    县、乡政府分工一名负责人帮助农民出主意、想办法，请能人出台，组织生产、销售。古邳镇盛产蒲草，各村就编蒲包，织蒲鞋，打蒲苫，编蒲草工艺扇。官山、岚山、张圩等乡就地取材，开山采石。王集、姚集、朱集３个乡加工柳编工艺品，龙头设在乡里，家家都是加工场。睢城乡潘庄村的羊毛衫厂，用的是手工机械，基本不受电的制约，市场上羊毛衫走俏，这个厂去年底又增加４０台织机，多安排了８０名剩余劳力。
