Title: A School Building Has Been Under Construction for Five Years

A school building in Lengshuitian Village, Yongxing Township of our county started construction in 1984. The building, with a total area of 306 square meters, has been under construction ever since and is yet to be completed. The wooden doors and windows that were originally installed have begun to rot after five years of exposure to the sun and rain. The timber used for construction is either rotting or infested with termites. The half-built red brick walls are covered with moss inside and out.

Over the past five years, some school-age children in the village have managed to transfer to other schools through connections; some have dropped out and stayed at home; a few who are eager to study but lack connections to study elsewhere have no choice but to cram into a dirty, narrow, and dimly lit rented room to study. If this situation continues, it will be difficult not only to achieve universal secondary education but even to achieve universal primary education.

　　一栋小学校舍五年未完工
    我县永兴乡冷水田村于１９８４年动工修建一栋３０６平方米的小学校舍，建建停停至今未竣工。原先已安装好的木制门窗，经过５年日晒雨淋，已经开始朽烂；建房用的木料朽的朽、“飞”的“飞”，已砌好的半截红砖墙壁里里外外长满青苔。
    ５年来，全村学龄儿童有的通过关系转到别的学校就读；有的辍学呆在家里；个别愿意学习，但又没有关系到外地求学的学生，只好挤在一间又脏、又窄、又暗的民房里学习。如此下去，别说普及中学教育，就是普及小学教育也难。
