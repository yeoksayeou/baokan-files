The Ministry of Supervision and the Ministry of Materials recently investigated and penalized the Huaiyin City Metal Materials Company in Jiangsu Province and the Weifang City Chemical and Light Industry Company in Shandong Province for illegally trading important production materials.

The Non-Ferrous Metals Department of the Huaiyin City Metal Materials Company colluded with the Huaiyin County Construction Materials Company and the metal materials companies of Suyang, Hongze, and Guannan counties on April 22 and 23 of last year to illegally trade 10.499 tons of planned electrolytic copper. The five companies collectively gained illegal income of 31,734.07 yuan. From August 5 to 28, the same department again colluded with two metal materials companies to falsify records and "sell" 24.8 tons of electrolytic copper at a price of 17,800 yuan per ton, resulting in a collective increase in sales revenue of 441,440 yuan for the companies involved.

The Weifang City Chemical and Light Industry Company in Shandong Province also engaged in illegal trading of important production materials. The Chemical Department of the company colluded with other material management units within the company to illegally trade 40.6 tons of non-planned caustic soda and 50 tons of low-pressure polyethylene, as well as 48 tons of caustic soda through fictitious transactions, gaining illegal income of 205,684 yuan.

The Ministry of Supervision, in conjunction with the Ministry of Materials, recently ordered the relevant units to make the following decisions: Administrator Pei Chengdong of the Huaiyin City Metal Materials Company was given a major demerit; Department Head Wang Guomin was removed from his administrative position; Deputy Department Head Shen Deyi was given a warning and dismissed from his administrative position. Administrator Wang Shihe and Department Head Sun Pingzhou of the Weifang City Chemical and Light Industry Company were ordered to write self-criticisms and were subject to a circular criticism.
