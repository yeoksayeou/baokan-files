The European Men's Gymnastics Championship has concluded. Soviet athletes won four gold medals.

	BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) - According to foreign wire reports, Soviet veteran Mogilny won two gold medals in the pommel horse and vault events at the European Men's Gymnastics Championship held in Stockholm yesterday.

	The 24-year-old Mogilny is the 1985 World Championships champion in the parallel bars and pommel horse. However, his performance in recent international competitions has been lackluster. In the all-around competition held the day before yesterday, he lost to his 19-year-old teammate Korchinsky and finished second. But in yesterday's final, he won the pommel horse and vault events with scores of 9.837 and 9.793, respectively.

	Mogilny also won a bronze medal in the parallel bars. The gold medal in the parallel bars was won by Bulgaria's K. Khristozov with a score of 9.837. Korchinsky topped the floor exercise with a score of 9.750, securing the fourth gold medal for the Soviet team in this competition. East Germany's Berendt and Wecker won the gold medals in the rings and horizontal bar events, respectively, with scores of 9.850 and 9.862.

    莫吉里尼还获得双杠的铜牌。双杠金牌被保加利亚的卡·赫里斯托佐夫夺走，成绩是９．８３７分。科罗钦斯科在自由体操比赛中以９．７５０分居首位，为苏联队在本届比赛中夺得第4枚金牌。民主德国的贝伦特和韦克尔分别取得了吊环和单杠的冠军，成绩分别是９．８５０分和９．８６２分。
