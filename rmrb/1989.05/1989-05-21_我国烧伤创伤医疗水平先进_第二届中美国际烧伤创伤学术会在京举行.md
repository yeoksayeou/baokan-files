Out of the 246 papers presented at this conference, 176 were from China, accounting for 70%. Whether in terms of the number of papers or their quality, China has already taken a leading position in the international field of clinical treatment and basic research of burns.

This conference will comprehensively summarize the new developments in the field of burn and trauma studies internationally since the first Sino-American International Burn and Trauma Academic Conference in 1985. The conference will focus on discussing the importance of establishing burn and trauma centers and creating a medical system for graded treatment; establishing a burn and trauma index for more scientific emergency treatment and anti-shock therapy; the pathogenesis and pathological changes of inhalation injuries; enhancing the body's immune function while combating infection; the causes of multiple organ failure after burns and trauma, nutritional support, and wound management; the storage and development of skin substitutes; the development of reconstructive surgery to better restore function; and new technologies and methods for the clinical treatment of vascular injuries, closed chest and abdominal injuries, and shock injuries.

China has formally established the burn specialty for over 30 years. The cure rate for burn patients in major burn centers or burn research institutes has reached 96%, and the cure rate for large-area deep burns is stable at 80%-85%. In addition, China's research on respiratory tract burns, phosphorus burns, burn immunity, epithelial cell culture, and skin storage has reached an advanced international level in both breadth and depth.
