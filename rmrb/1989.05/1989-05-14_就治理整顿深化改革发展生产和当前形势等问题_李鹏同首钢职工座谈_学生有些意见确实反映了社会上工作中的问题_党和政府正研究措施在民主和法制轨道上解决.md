Premier Li Peng held a discussion with workers and leaders of the Capital Steel Company on May 13th, focusing on economic management, deepening reform, developing production, and the current situation.

From January to April this year, the workers of Capital Steel, with a strong sense of responsibility, have been working hard to overcome various unfavorable factors such as price increases and shortages of energy and transportation. As a result, the company's economic benefits have continued to improve steadily. Compared to the same period last year, steel production increased by 9.2%, and profits increased by 24%. The company's leaders said that based on the current momentum, the company can still achieve a 20% increase in profits this year. Li Peng expressed satisfaction with Capital Steel's achievements in reform and production management. He fully affirmed the workers' enthusiasm and dedication to their jobs, saying that Capital Steel's rapid development in recent years is a result of the reform and opening-up policy, as well as the company's effective leadership and the workers' high quality.

During the discussion, the workers of Capital Steel provided valuable insights on how to manage the economy, deepen reform, and revitalize large enterprises, as well as how to stabilize prices and combat corruption. Li Peng thanked the workers for their valuable suggestions and emphasized the importance of working together to improve economic management and deepen reform. He explained that the current economic adjustments are temporary, comparing it to taking a breath after running fast, with the goal of overcoming current economic difficulties and achieving better reform and opening-up. He stressed the need for a peaceful international environment and a stable political situation domestically to successfully carry out the Four Modernizations. Economic development and social stability are closely linked to the efforts of the broad masses of workers, who are the main force in both production and maintaining stability.

When discussing the workers' views on students taking to the streets, Li Peng said that the government welcomes criticism and suggestions from workers, students, and the general public. He acknowledged that some of the students' criticisms, such as those regarding economic chaos, bureaucratism in party and government organs, and certain corrupt practices, reflect real problems in society and our work. The Party and the government are studying a series of effective measures to address these issues through democratic and legal channels. While continuing to deepen economic reforms, we will also push forward political reforms.

Participants in the discussion included Zhang Jianmin, a member of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and deputy mayor of Beijing, Wu Yi, deputy mayor of Beijing, Yan Chengzong, director of the Beijing Municipal Economic Commission, and Wang Rulin, deputy minister of the Ministry of Metallurgy.

    新华社北京５月１４日电　国务院总理李鹏５月１３日上午来到首都钢铁公司，同这个公司的炼钢工、轧钢工等生产第一线的工人和领导干部，就治理整顿、深化改革、发展生产和当前形势等问题座谈对话。
    今年１至４月份，首钢的职工以高度的主人翁责任感千方百计挖掘生产潜力，克服了涨价和能源、交通紧张带来的许多不利因素，使企业经济效益继续稳步提高。和去年同期相比，钢产量增长９．２％，实现利润增长２４％。这个公司的领导干部说，从现在的势头看，今年仍可以实现利润递增２０％的目标。李鹏对首钢坚持改革和加强生产经营取得的成果表示满意。他对首钢工人以饱满的情绪，坚守岗位，努力搞好生产予以充分肯定。他说，首钢这几年发展很快，这是实行改革开放的结果，同时也说明首钢领导得力，职工团结，工人素质好。
    首钢的工人在座谈中就如何整顿治理、深化改革、搞活大企业，以及稳定物价、反对腐败等问题，提出了中肯的意见。李鹏说：感谢大家提出了许多好的意见。我们要共同努力，搞好治理整顿和深化改革。当前的压缩是暂时的，就像跑得很快，要喘一口气，目的是为了克服当前经济中存在的困难，更好地改革、开放。我们要顺利地进行四个现代化建设，在国际上需要一个和平的环境，在国内需要一个安定团结的政治局面。经济发展、社会稳定都和广大职工的努力分不开。广大工人是发展生产的主力军，也是维护安定团结的主力军。
    在听取首钢工人对学生上街游行的看法时，李鹏说，政府欢迎工人、学生和广大群众提出批评和建议。学生们的有些意见，如对经济生活中的混乱现象，党政机关中的官僚主义和某些腐败现象的意见，确实反映了社会上和我们工作中存在的问题。党和政府正在研究一系列有力的措施，通过民主和法制的轨道来解决这些问题。我们将在继续深化经济体制改革的同时进一步推进政治体制改革。
    参加这次座谈对话的有中共北京市委常委、北京市副市长张健民，北京市副市长吴仪，北京市经委主任阎承宗，冶金部副部长王汝林等。
