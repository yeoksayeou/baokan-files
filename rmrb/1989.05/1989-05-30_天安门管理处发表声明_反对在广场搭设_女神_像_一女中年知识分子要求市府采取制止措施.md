The Tiananmen Management Office today issued a statement regarding the erection of the "Goddess" statue on Tiananmen Square by some individuals.

The statement said, Tiananmen Square is an important venue for our country's political gatherings and welcoming ceremonies. It is a square for all the people of the nation and a place of utmost solemnity and dignity. Now, some individuals have erected a so-called "Goddess" statue on Tiananmen Square, which is extremely disrespectful and violates the Beijing Municipal Government's notice issued on November 1, 1981. One of the important responsibilities of the Tiananmen Management Office is to protect Tiananmen Square. Therefore, we firmly oppose such actions by some individuals. We believe that the people of the entire nation will also firmly oppose this. We request that these individuals immediately stop such activities.

The statement pointed out that the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes is where the portrait of revolutionary forerunner Dr. Sun Yat-sen is displayed during major national holidays. For a so-called "Goddess" statue to appear in this place is a desecration and insult to our country's dignity and national image.

According to information from the Beijing Municipal Government's Letter and Visit Office, from last night to today, some individuals, without authorization, erected a so-called "Goddess" statue on the solemn Tiananmen Square. A female middle-aged intellectual from a certain design institute under a state organ went to the municipal government, demanding that immediate measures be taken to stop this.

In her written opinion, she stated, Tiananmen is the symbol of New China, forged with the blood of heroes and martyrs. Only the monument to heroes and martyrs can represent the will of the people who have fought for freedom and democracy. Those who claim to want democracy, have you sought the opinions of the people of the entire nation and the entire city? Those who claim to want freedom, are you not imposing your will on others? Please respect this fact: this is China, not the United States. Even in the United States, it is not allowed to build statues at will in front of the Capitol. I strongly demand that the municipal government take corresponding measures to stop this lawless act of trampling on public opinion. In the lowest sense, their actions are also illegal constructions. On Children's Day, many children will come to Tiananmen to visit the Monument to the People's Heroes. To prevent children's minds from being influenced negatively, I strongly demand that relevant municipal departments resolve this issue as soon as possible.

    天安门管理处发表声明
    反对在广场搭设“女神”像
    一女中年知识分子要求市府采取制止措施
    新华社北京5月30日电  北京市天安门管理处今天就有些人在天安门广场搭设“女神”像一事发表声明。
    声明说，天安门广场是我国举行政治性集会和迎宾活动的重要场所，是全国人民的广场，是非常庄严肃穆的地方。现在有人把什么“女神”像搭设在天安门广场，是极不严肃的，也是违反北京市人民政府1981年11月1日通告的。我们天安门管理处的重要职责之一，就是保护好天安门广场，所以，我们坚决反对一些人这样做，我们相信，全国人民也是会坚决反对的，请一些人立即停止这种活动。
    声明指出，人民英雄纪念碑北侧是我国每年重大节日时矗立革命先驱孙中山先生巨幅画像的地方，在这个地方冒出一个什么“女神”像，这是对我们国家尊严和民族形象的一种污辱和践踏。
    新华社北京5月30日电  据北京市人民政府信访办消息：从昨天晚上到今天，一些人未经批准在庄严肃穆的天安门广场搭设什么“女神”像。国家机关某委设计院的一位女中年知识分子前往市政府，要求尽快采取制止措施。
    她在留下的书面意见中说，天安门是新中国的象征，是英雄先烈用鲜血浇铸的，只有英雄先烈的纪念碑才能体现为自由民主奋斗的人民的意志。口口声声要民主的人，你们这种做法征求过全国、全市人民的意见吗？口口声声要自由的人，你们不是把自己的意志强加于别人吗？请尊重这一事实：这是中国，不是美国，就是美国也不允许在国会大厦前随意修建塑像的。我强烈要求市政府采取相应的措施制止这一无法无天的强奸民意的行径。我认为他们的做法从最低的角度说，也是属于非法建筑，“六一”儿童节时众多的儿童即将来天安门瞻仰英雄纪念碑，为了不让儿童的心灵受到不健康的影响，我强烈要求市有关部门尽快解决这一问题。
