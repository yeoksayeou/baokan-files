The urban and rural areas of Lingshan County in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have strengthened the management of land, educating the people to treasure every inch of land. In the past two years, the county has saved 3,520 mu of land for construction, including 1,800 mu of arable land, which accounts for about 78% of the land use quota allocated by higher authorities.

After the state promulgated the Land Law in 1986, the county stipulated that regardless of whether it is an organization, collective, or individual, anyone who builds a house must first apply to the land management department for land use. After approval and measurement, only if it meets the national land use standards can construction begin. Those who occupy land and build houses without approval will be ordered to demolish and fined.

　　灵山城乡惜土如金
    据新华社南宁５月２５日电  （记者刘星泽）广西壮族自治区灵山县切实加强对土地的管理，教育城乡人民珍惜每一寸土地，近两年全县城乡节约建房用地３５２０多亩，其中耕地１８００多亩，约占上级下达的用地指标的７８％。
    １９８６年国家公布土地法以后，这个县规定，不管单位、集体或个人，谁建房屋，首先必须向土地管理部门申请用地，经过批准和丈量，符合国家规定用地标准的，才准动工兴建；不经过批准就乱占土地建房的都要令其拆毁和罚款处理。
