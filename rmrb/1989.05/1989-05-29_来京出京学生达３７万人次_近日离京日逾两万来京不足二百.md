	Over 370,000 students have entered and exited Beijing. In recent days, more than 20,000 students have left Beijing, while fewer than 200 have entered. This information was provided by a responsible official at Beijing Station.

	The official said that since the imposition of martial law in Beijing, the number of students leaving the city has been increasing. The highest number of students leaving in a single day was 30,000. Over the past three days, more than 90,000 students have left Beijing. In contrast, the number of students entering Beijing has significantly decreased. Yesterday, only 200 students entered the city, and today it is estimated that fewer than 100 will arrive.

	Beijing Railway Station has taken active measures to ensure the smooth return of students to their schools. They have established a leading group for the transportation of out-of-town students and organized more than 1,000 officials, police officers, and soldiers to maintain order. Even when the passenger flow is at its peak, 70% of the seats are reserved for students, ensuring they have tickets. Additionally, six temporary trains have been added.

	Among a group of students preparing to buy tickets to return to school, they frankly told the reporter that they were already very tired. The air in Tiananmen Square was not good, and staying in Beijing for too long would bring many inconveniences to the people of Beijing. Over the past few days, everything they ate and used was provided by the people of Beijing.

	A student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology said, "We still hope that the government will sincerely dialogue with us so that we young people will not be desperate. I am leaving Beijing with a heart full of tears and sweat. I will tell my classmates about the real situation in Beijing."

	At the entrance to the station, there were still students from Beijing giving speeches, with about 300 people listening.

	An Anhui student who had come to Beijing for the third time said that they hoped the upcoming National People's Congress Standing Committee meeting would solve some substantive issues.

	Unlike the previous days, students coming to Beijing from other provinces did not have banners or organized leaders.

　　来京出京学生达３７万人次
    近日离京日逾两万来京不足二百
    本报北京５月２９日讯  截至昨日，外地学生进出京已达３７万人次。现在，来京学生大量减少，离京返校学生日逾两万。这是北京站有关负责人提供的情况。这位负责人介绍，北京戒严后离京返校学生呈上升趋势。最多的一天走３万人次。这３天离京学生就达９万。近日进京学生锐减，昨天只有２００人，今天估计不到１００人。
    北京火车站为学生顺利返校采取了积极措施。他们专门成立了外地学生运行领导小组，组织了千余名机关干部、民警、解放军战士维持秩序；在客流量暴满的情况下，每天为学生空出７０％客坐票，保证学生使用，增开了６列临时客车。
    记者来到一群准备买票返校的学生中间，他们坦率地告诉记者，他们已经太劳累了，天安门广场空气不好，而且久留北京会给北京人民带来许多困难，这几天吃用都是北京市民供给的。
    华中理工大学一位同学说：“我们仍然希望政府真诚和我们对话，这样我们青年人才不至于绝望。我是带着满身泪水和汗水离京的。我会向同学讲述北京的真实情况。”
    在进站的地方，仍然有北京市的学生在演讲，大约有３００人左右在听演讲。
    一位第三次来北京的安徽学生说，他们希望即将召开的人大常委会能解决一些实质性问题。
    与前几天不同的是，外地来京的学生没有旗帜、没有组织队伍的领队。
