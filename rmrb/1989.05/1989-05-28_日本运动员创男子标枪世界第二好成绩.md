Japanese athlete achieves second-best men's javelin throw in history

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on May 28, foreign news agencies reported that on May 27, Japanese javelin athlete Kazuyoshi Mikuni threw 87.60 meters at the Bruce Jenner Track and Field Meet in San Jose, USA, achieving the second-best men's javelin throw in history. This result is only 6 centimeters short of the world record of 87.66 meters set by Jan Zelezny of Czechoslovakia in 1987.

Kazuyoshi Mikuni is 27 years old this year. He graduated from Kyoto University of Industry and is currently employed in the sales department of a Japanese sports goods company. During his fourth attempt, a gust of wind blew from behind him, which helped him achieve the second-best men's javelin throw in history of 87.60 meters.

　　日本运动员创男子标枪世界第二好成绩
    据新华社北京５月２８日电  据外电报道，日本标枪运动员沟口和洋２７日在美国圣何塞举行的布鲁斯·詹纳田径大奖赛上，投出了８７米６０的历史上第二个男子标枪最好成绩。这一成绩比捷克斯洛伐克运动员扬·泽莱兹尼１９８７年创造的这个项目世界纪录仅差６厘米。
    沟口和洋今年２７岁，毕业于日本京都产业大学，目前在一家日本体育商品公司的销售部门任职。沟口和洋在第四次试投时正巧从他后面刮来了一阵风，这阵风在一定程度上帮他创造了８７米６０的世界第二好成绩。
