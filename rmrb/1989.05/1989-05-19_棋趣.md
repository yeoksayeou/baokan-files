Every year during the cherry blossom festival, the residents of Kyoto, Japan's "thousand-year-old capital," hold a unique live chess event. The playing area is divided into 64 squares to form a "chessboard," with women in kimonos and men in samurai costumes either sitting or standing on the board to act as chess pieces. The players sit on high stools and give loud commands, directing the "chess pieces" to advance and retreat, creating a lively and interesting scene.

Choosing a Partner Through Chess
In the small town of Hitzacker in the former East Germany, people of all ages enjoy playing international chess. On New Year's Day, young men eagerly visit the homes of young women and challenge the women's fathers to a game. Each match consists of only one game. If the young man wins, the door to love is opened. If he loses, he must wait until his chess skills improve before trying again.

Alcohol Chess
In Colombia, there is a unique chess game called "Menaque Alcohol Chess." It uses 37 small bottles (each containing different types of alcohol) as chess pieces. One piece is placed in the center of the board as the immovable central piece, while each player has 18 pieces. Instead of capturing the opponent's pieces, the game uses a strategy of forcing the opponent's pieces into a corner. If a player's pieces are forced into a position with no way out, that player loses. According to the rules, the winner must drink three small bottles of alcohol for each game won, the more games won, the more alcohol consumed. The loser can only watch as others enjoy the alcohol.

The Smallest Chess Set
A French jeweler created what is considered the world's smallest international chess set. The chessboard is only 1/4 square inch, and the chess pieces are surprisingly small. The "king" is only 8/100 of an inch tall, and the "pawn" is even smaller, at 4/100 of an inch. Players must use a magnifying glass to play the game.

Underwater Chess
Florida is located in the southern United States. To escape the torment of the summer heat, some chess enthusiasts moved their matches to the bottom of a 2-meter-deep swimming pool. The chessboard and pieces are specially made.

During the match, the players take a breath and dive underwater to make a move, then surface to breathe and think about their next move. Sometimes, due to the intense competition, they have to take several breaths to make a single move.

　　棋趣
    志明
    活棋对弈每年樱花节，日本“千年古都”——京都居民都要举行独具一格的活棋对弈活动。人们将场地划为６４个格子作“棋盘”，穿和服的妇女和穿武士服的男子或坐或站在棋盘上充当棋子。棋手坐在高凳上，大声发出号令，指挥“棋子”们进退搏杀，情景甚为有趣。
    以棋择偶　在民主德国的希乔贝克小镇上，男女老幼都喜爱下国际象棋。每逢新年这一天，小伙子们兴致勃勃地走进姑娘家，与姑娘的父亲对弈，每次只下一盘。若小伙子获胜，爱情大门便打开了。如果输了，那就等棋艺有了长进再来。
    酒棋　哥伦比亚有一种很有趣味的棋，叫“梅纳克酒棋”。它用３７只小瓶（内装不同的酒）作棋子，除一只棋子放在棋盘的中央，作为不能移动的中心棋外，双方各有１８个棋子。下棋时不吃掉对方的棋子，而采取逼退的招法。如果一方的棋子被逼得无路可走，那他就输了。按规定，胜者每胜一盘须喝完三小瓶酒，胜得越多喝得越多。败者只好眼睁睁地看着别人喝美酒了。
    体积最小的棋　法国一珠宝商制作了一副堪称世界上最小的国际象棋。它的棋盘只有１／４平方英寸，棋子小得令人吃惊，“王”的高度只有８％英寸，“兵”更小，只有４％英寸，对弈者只有借助放大镜才能下棋。
    水下对弈　佛罗里达州位于美国南部。为了逃避盛夏高温的折磨，一些酷爱国际象棋的人把比赛移到２米深的游泳池底，棋盘和棋子都是特制的。
    比赛时，对弈者先吸口气潜入水中，走一步棋再浮出水面换气，边换气边思考下步棋怎么走。有时，因比赛竞争激烈，要换好几口气才能走一着。
