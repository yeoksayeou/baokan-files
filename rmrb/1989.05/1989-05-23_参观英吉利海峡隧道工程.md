In the spring days, I had the honor of leading a delegation of tunnel and underground engineering technology experts to France to inspect the Channel Tunnel project. Accompanying us was Engineer Jules, an expert who has worked for many years at the world's largest tunnel research institution, the Lyon International Tunnel Research Center. He informed us that the Channel Tunnel project was first proposed in 1753 by the Frenchman Nicolas Desmaret, who suggested building an underwater passage. In 1834, Martino Favier proposed using the submerged box method to construct the tunnel. In 1855, Tom Dagmar realistically proposed using a metal submerged box method to build the tunnel, which was supported by Napoleon III, but was vetoed by the British side. There have been more than a dozen proposals in history that have not been realized. It was not until February 1986 that France and Britain formally signed an agreement to build the Channel Tunnel, and preparations began.

At the French starting point of the Channel Tunnel project, which is the construction site we are visiting, we were immediately attracted by the 10-meter-diameter tunnel emblem standing at the entrance of the construction site. The host showed us a film about the Channel Tunnel project, and we viewed the tunnel model and various pictures and data. Afterwards, we changed into work clothes and inspected the large-scale tunnel construction shaft with a diameter of 51 meters and a depth of 54 meters, as well as the horizontal tunnel excavation operations. The Channel Tunnel project is indeed one of the largest engineering projects of this century. It runs from Sangatte in France to Folkestone in the UK, with a total length of 50.5 kilometers and a depth of 100 meters underwater. It consists of two main tunnels with a cross-section diameter of 7.6 meters and one safety tunnel with a cross-section diameter of 4.8 meters. After completion, a car can depart every three minutes, with an annual cargo volume of 3.6 million tons. The total construction cost is 60 billion francs, jointly built by France and Britain. Construction began in September 1988, using fully mechanized and advanced construction methods without waste discharge. The entire project involves excavating approximately 10 million cubic meters of stone, all of which is crushed and flushed away with water. The plan is to complete the excavation by July 1991 and to complete and hand over the project by May 1993.

Reflecting on this project, what I felt most deeply was how to realize the macro-management function of the government. For example, this project, with an investment of 60 billion francs, is entirely funded by stocks and loans from 209 banks, and is constructed by the European Tunnel Group. After completion, they will manage and collect fees, and it is estimated that they will recover the investment and profits within 10 to 15 years, after which they will hand over management to the state. The French government is only responsible for signing an agreement with the British government to approve the construction of the tunnel, and the government does not interfere in other matters. Therefore, it fully reflects the macro-management function of the government. Currently, our country is deepening economic system reforms, and we can also learn from the experience of the Channel Tunnel project to undertake some engineering projects.

### 参观英吉利海峡隧道工程

　　参观英吉利海峡隧道工程
    邹宪荣
    在春天的日子里，我有幸率领一个隧道及地下工程技术考察团赴法考察英吉利海峡隧道工程。陪同我们的是儒列工程师，在世界最大的隧道研究机构——里昂国际隧道研究中心工作多年的专家。他告诉我们，英吉利海峡工程，早在１７５３年法国人尼古拉·戴斯马尼提出建设海底通道的意见，１８３４年马蒂诺·法菲尔建议用人工沉箱法建设隧道，１８５５年汤姆·待伽蒙又现实地提出用金属沉箱法建造隧道，并得到拿破仑三世的赞同，但被英方否决，历史上曾有十几次建议都未实现，直到１９８６年２月法英两国正式签订了建设英吉利海峡隧道计划协议，才开始进行各项准备工作。
    在英吉利海峡隧道工程法国负责施工的起点，也就是我们要参观的施工现场。我们一下车，就被工地门口矗立的直径约１０米的隧道图徽而吸引，主人为我们放映了海峡隧道工程电影，观看了隧道模型和各种图片资料，之后，我们换上了工作服，参观了直径为５１米、深为５４米的大型隧道施工竖井和隧道水平方向掘进施工操作等。英吉利海峡隧道工程不愧是本世纪世界上最大的工程之一，它从法国的桑加特到英国的佛里斯得尼，全长５０．５公里，深为水下１００米，由两条断面直径为７．６米的主隧道和一条断面直径为４．８米的安全隧道所组成。建成后，每３分钟可开出一辆汽车，年运货量３６０万吨。总造价６００亿法郎，由法英两国共同建造。１９８８年９月正式开工，全部采用机械化和无渣排放的先进施工方法，整个工程挖石方约１０００万立方米，均以破碎后用水冲泄排放施工。计划１９９１年７月挖通，１９９３年５月竣工交付使用。
    联系这项工程，使我感受最深的，是如何实现政府职能宏观管理的问题。例如，这项工程投资６００亿法郎，全部由股票和２０９家银行贷款解决，并由欧洲隧道集团公司承建。建成后由它们管理、收费，大约１０至１５年全部收回投资和利润，然后再移交国家管理。而法国政府只负责与英国政府签订同意建设隧道协议，其余诸事政府一概不管，因此，完全体现出政府宏观管理的职能。当前我国正在深化经济体制改革，我们也可借鉴英吉利海峡隧道工程的经验，举办一些工程事业。
