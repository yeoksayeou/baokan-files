Breaking Through the Difficulties to Develop Dryland Agriculture

Reporter: Hě Huángbiāo

Xìn Nǎiqián, male, born in 1936. Deputy Director of the Science and Technology Management Department and Deputy Researcher at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. He has recently led and authored works such as "Water Conditions and Air Conditioning Technology in Dryland Agriculture" and "Accelerating the Modernization of Chinese Agriculture," and has published dozens of papers on agricultural topics.

Reporter: The current agricultural situation is severe, with grain supplies becoming tight. To break through these difficulties and advance to a new level, a new scientific approach is needed.

Xìn Nǎiqián: Turning to the map of China's agricultural regions, he pointed to the areas along the Kunlun Mountains, Qinling Mountains, and north of the Huai River, saying: I have been thinking about this problem. In addition to continuing to focus on agriculture in the eastern regions, we should also turn our attention to the vast dry and semi-arid regions and vigorously develop dryland agriculture. If we can develop agriculture in these dry and semi-arid regions, China's agriculture can break through the difficulties and achieve new development.

Reporter: Why is developing dryland agriculture given such an important position?

Xìn Nǎiqián: First of all, China's dryland agricultural area is vast, and the potential for increased production is also significant. The 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in China's dry and semi-arid regions, with 741 counties, have 570 million mu of cultivated land, accounting for approximately 38% of the country's total cultivated land. The current grain yield per mu is relatively low, averaging only 200 to 300 jin. Secondly, China is a country with a monsoon climate, with significant seasonal variations and uneven regional distribution of rainfall, and the threat of drought is long-term. Thirdly, based on domestic and international experience, if natural rainfall can be fully utilized to develop dryland agriculture, the potential for increased production is substantial. For example, in the dry and semi-arid regions of the central and western United States, the development of dry farming has established a base for commercial agricultural and livestock production, with wheat production accounting for 63.7% of the national total and beef production accounting for 50%. In the dry regions of Central Asia in the Soviet Union, cotton production has risen to the top in the world. In the dry and semi-arid regions of southern Australia, the implementation of a grain and forage rotation system has resulted in grain production accounting for 96% of the total in Australia. In countries like India, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, which are mostly dry and semi-arid regions, they have transformed from grain-deficient countries to self-sufficient or surplus countries. In China, there are also many successful examples of high yields in dry and semi-arid regions. For example, in Heyang County, Shaanxi Province, located in the northern part of the Wei River, 500,000 mu of wheat has an average yield of over 400 jin per mu, achieving 0.5 kilograms of grain production per millimeter of rainfall, reaching an advanced level. This shows that there is still considerable potential for increased production in the vast dry and semi-arid regions of China.

Reporter: In recent years, scientists from various countries have warned about the problem of global warming due to the greenhouse effect, and droughts may become more prominent.

Xìn Nǎiqián: Yes, in 1988, drought swept across North America, causing a 30% reduction in grain production in the United States and a 23% reduction in Canada. According to experts in global meteorology, by the mid-21st century, the global temperature will increase by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees, and water and drought disasters, especially droughts, will become even more prominent.

Reporter: What are the strategies for developing agriculture in China's dry and semi-arid regions?

Xìn Nǎiqián: This question needs to be addressed in two ways. One situation is the development of irrigated agriculture in arid regions. These regions are mainly distributed in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu, the Qaidam Basin of Qinghai, most of Xinjiang, and parts of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia. The annual rainfall in these regions is less than 250 millimeters, so without irrigation, there can be no agriculture. The development of agriculture in these regions mainly relies on mountain snowmelt and groundwater. On one hand, water resources are extremely scarce and insufficient, and on the other hand, the utilization of water is very irrational and wasteful. Therefore, how to effectively utilize limited water resources is an important issue for the development of agriculture in these regions and the construction of high-standard, high-yield, and stable production. Based on domestic and international experience, the main ways to improve water resource utilization efficiency are as follows: First, improve the water channels and prevent seepage; second, promote water-saving irrigation technologies, such as surface drip irrigation, and in suitable conditions, develop sprinkler and drip irrigation. Third, focus on irrigation during the critical periods of crops, that is, irrigate according to the critical water requirements of various crops.

The other situation is the development of dry farming in arid regions. This region is more widely distributed, mainly including the northern part of North China, the western part of Northwest China, and the western part of Northeast China. In addition to having some irrigation conditions, it mainly relies on natural rainfall to develop dry farming. In this regard, China has rich traditional experience, and in recent years, new experience has been gained through exploration, that is, first, improve agricultural production conditions through agricultural infrastructure construction, enhance disaster resistance, and second, conduct rational crop layout, third, select drought-resistant crops and varieties, fourth, expand fertilizer sources, improve soil fertility, and improve fertilizer utilization, fifth, practice fine farming, water conservation, and improve water resource utilization. In short, it is necessary to integrate the above measures into a technical system suitable for dry farming.

It is also worth noting that in recent years, various places have combined traditional farming techniques with modern science and technology, promoting stubble mulching, minimum tillage, and no-tillage technologies in arid regions, achieving good results, which is worth paying attention to.

Reporter: You mentioned earlier that a rational layout should be conducted and drought-resistant crops and varieties should be selected. Are there any problems in these aspects?

Xìn Nǎiqián: From an overall perspective, the crop layout in this region and the selection of drought-resistant crop varieties are relatively good, and most of them are based on local resource conditions and production characteristics to conduct rational crop layout and select drought-resistant crops.

However, in recent years, with the improvement of farmers' living standards, many people want to eat fine grains, and the planting area of wheat has been continuously expanding, while the planting area of some drought-resistant crops, such as millet, proso millet, sorghum, legumes, and tubers, has been shrinking. This cannot be ignored. Because the water requirement of wheat crops is much higher than that of drought-resistant crops such as millet and proso millet. Generally, the water requirement for producing 1 gram of dry matter is 300 grams for millet and proso millet, 320 grams for sorghum, and 540 grams for wheat. It can be seen that millet, proso millet, and sorghum are more drought-resistant and more suitable for planting in this region. In addition, in terms of yield, millet, proso millet, legumes, and tubers have relatively stable yields under drought conditions, while wheat has low and unstable yields, with significant fluctuations. Moreover, in terms of nutritional value, millet, proso millet, and legumes have higher protein, amino acids, and vitamins than wheat. Therefore, it is not appropriate to blindly expand the wheat planting area and reduce the planting area of drought-resistant crops in arid regions.

Reporter: In people's habits, millet and proso millet are often considered "coarse grains" and are not favored. What do you think should be done?

Xìn Nǎiqián: It doesn't have to be that way. For example, many people in cities want to change their diet and eat some coarse grains. On one hand, it solves the problem of monotonous diet and unreasonable dietary structure; on the other hand, these crops have high nutritional value. From the development abroad, I have visited some countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. They attach great importance to the development of drought-resistant crops in arid regions, especially for millet, proso millet, and legumes.

Now, in the Middle East, countries like Syria, Jordan, and Egypt have developed legumes as a major source of protein for urban and rural residents. Especially their deep-processed food products have good palatability and high nutritional value, not only are they popular, but they have also become export products for earning foreign exchange.

Reporter: Based on China's specific situation, do you have any other ideas for developing dryland agriculture?

Xìn Nǎiqián: To truly develop China's dryland agriculture, in addition to relying on policies and material input, more importantly, it relies on the progress of science and technology.

Since the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the state has included dryland agriculture in the national key research and development projects. It is suggested that during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," key research should be conducted on water conservation and soil conservation cultivation systems, planting systems and rotation systems, fertilization and soil improvement systems, and water-saving irrigation technologies, striving for new progress and breakthroughs, and providing more scientific and technological achievements for the development of dryland agriculture.

　　冲出困境发展旱地农业
    本报记者  何黄彪
    信乃诠，男，１９３６年生。中国农科院科研管理部副主任、副研究员。他近年主持并撰写过《旱地农业水份状况与空调技术》、《加速我国农业现代化》等著作，还发表过数十篇有关农业方面的论文。
    记者：当前农业形势严峻，粮食趋于紧张。如何使农业冲出困境，登上新的台阶，需要一种新的科学思路。
    信乃诠：转身打开中国农业区划图，指着沿昆仑山脉、秦岭、淮河以北的地区说：我一直在思考着这个问题，除了继续重视东部地区的农业之外，还要把目光投向广大干旱、半干旱地区，大力发展旱地农业。如果能把干旱、半干旱地区的农业搞上去，我国农业就可以冲出困境，得到一个新的发展。
    记者：为什么把发展旱地农业放到这么重要的位置？
    信乃诠：首先，我国的旱地农业面积大，增产潜力也大。我国干旱、半干旱地区的１６个省、市、自治区，７４１个县，现有耕地５．７亿亩，约占全国耕地面积３８％。目前的粮食单产水平比较低，平均亩产只有２００～３００多斤。其次，我国是一个季风气候的国家，降水季节变率大，地区分布很不均匀，干旱的威胁是长期的。再次，从国内外的经验来看，如果能够充分利用自然降水来发展旱地农业，增产潜力是很大的。像美国中西部干旱、半干旱地区，由于发展旱作农业，现已建成农牧业商品生产基地，小麦总产量占到全国的６３．７％，牛肉产量占到５０％；像苏联中亚干旱地区的开发，棉花总产跃居世界首位；像澳大利亚南部干旱、半干旱地区，推行粮草轮作制，谷物产量占到全澳９６％。像印度、埃及、沙特阿拉伯，大部分是干旱、半干旱地区，它们已由缺粮国变成基本自给或自给有余的国家。我国的干旱和半干旱地区取得高产的成功典型也不少见。比如陕西境内位于渭北的合阳县，５０万亩小麦平均亩产超过４００斤，实现了１个毫米的降水生产粮食０．５公斤，达到先进水平。由此可见，在我国广大干旱、半干旱地区，增产潜力还相当大。
    记者：近年来，各国科学家都在警告由于温室效应地球气候变暖的问题，干旱恐怕会越来越突出。
    信乃诠：是的，像１９８８年，干旱席卷北美，使美国谷类作物减产３０％。加拿大减产２３％。又据世界气象学专家预测，到下个世纪中叶，全球气温将增加１．５至４．５度，水旱灾害、特别是干旱就更为突出。
    记者：我国干旱、半干旱地区的农业发展有何对策？
    信乃诠：这个问题要分两种情况来说。一种情况就是旱区的灌溉农业。这个干旱地区主要分布甘肃的河西走廊，青海的柴达木盆地，新疆的大部分地区，以及宁夏、内蒙部分地区。它年降水量都少于２５０毫米，可以说没有灌溉就没有农业。该地区农业的发展，主要靠高山雪水和地下水。一方面水资源十分短缺不足，另一方面水的利用很不合理，浪费又十分严重。因此，如何有效地利用有限的水资源，是发展该地区农业，建设高标准高产、稳产的一个重要问题。从国内外经验来看，提高水资源的利用率主要途径有这么几条：一是搞好渠道补砌防渗；二是推广节水灌溉技术，比如地面小溪灌溉，在条件适宜的地方发展喷灌和滴灌。三是抓好作物关键期的灌水，即根据各种作物需水的临界期进行灌水。
    另一种情况就是发展旱区的旱作农业。这个地区分布更广。主要包括华北、西北和东北西部地区。除了有一部分灌溉条件之外，主要是依靠自然降水来发展旱作农业。这方面我国有过丰富的传统经验，近几年来，经过探索又取得了新的经验，那就是一要搞好农田基本建设，改善农业生产条件，提高抗灾能力；二要进行作物合理布局；三要选用耐旱作物和抗旱品种；四要广辟肥源，培肥地力，提高肥料的利用率；五要精耕细作，蓄水保墒，提高水资源的利用率等等。总之，就是要把以上措施组装配套成适应旱作农业技术体系。
    还要指出的是，近几年各地又把传统耕作技术与现代科学技术相结合，在旱区推行残茬覆盖、少耕免耕技术等，取得了很好的效果，值得重视。
    记者：你刚才说，要进行合理布局，选用耐旱作物和品种，难道在这些方面存在什么问题？
    信乃诠：从总的情况来看，这个地区的作物布局和在耐旱作物品种选用上是比较好的，大都能从本地的资源条件、生产特点出发进行作物合理布局和选择耐旱作物。
    但是近些年来，随着农民生活水平的提高，不少人想吃细粮，小麦种植面积不断扩大，而一些耐旱作物，如谷子、糜子、高粱、杂豆、薯类等的种植面积在缩小。这不能不引起注意。因为小麦作物需水量比谷子、糜子等耐旱作物要大得多，大体上每生产１克干物质的需水量，谷、糜只要３００克，高粱３２０克，而小麦则需要５４０克。可见谷子、糜子、高粱耐旱，更适于这个地区的种植。再有，从产量看，谷、糜、豆类、薯类作物在干旱条件下产量比较稳定，而小麦则产量低而不稳，波动比较大。此外，从营养价值看，谷子、糜子、豆类的蛋白质、氨基酸、维生素都比小麦高。因此，在干旱地区盲目扩大小麦面积，压缩耐旱作物面积是不适宜的。
    记者：在人们的习惯中，都把谷、糜这些旱作物当作“粗粮”，不太喜欢吃，您认为该怎么办？
    信乃诠：也不一定是这样。像城市里的许多人都想换换口味吃一些杂粮。一方面解决食物单一，膳食结构不合理；另一方面，这些作物营养价值也高啊。从国外的发展来看，我曾访问过中东和东南亚的一些国家。他们在干旱地区发展耐旱作物，对于谷、糜、豆类是十分重视的。
    现在，在中东的叙利亚、约旦、埃及，发展豆类已成了城乡居民获取蛋白的主要来源之一。特别是他们深加工的一些食品，适口性好，营养价值很高，不仅大家都爱吃，还成了外销创汇食品。
    记者：根据我国的具体情况，你对发展旱地农业还有一些什么设想？
    信乃诠：要真正把我国旱地农业发展起来，除了靠政策、靠物质投入之外，更多的要依靠科学技术的进步。
    从“七五”开始，国家已经把旱地农业列入了国家重大攻关项目。建议在“八五”期间，重点开展保水保土耕作制度、种植制度和轮作体系、施肥培肥制度、节水灌溉技术等研究，争取有新的进展和突破，为旱地农业的发展提供更多的科技成果。
