A memorial hall dedicated to Li Qingzhao has recently been unveiled in Qingzhou, Shandong, her "second hometown."

The newly completed Li Qingzhao Memorial Hall is located by Yangxi Lake and consists of parts such as the Ci Corridor, the Return Hall, the Jin Shi Studio, the Yi'an Room, and the Renjie Pavilion, covering an area of over 3,000 square meters. Inside the Return Hall, there is a sculpture of Li Qingzhao and her husband Zhao Mingcheng playing the zither and singing together, carved from white marble. The courtyard is planted with banana trees and chrysanthemums, while the lake is filled with lotus flowers and duckweed, all of which reflect the elegant scenes often described in Li Qingzhao's poems, such as "rain beating the banana leaves" and "mistakenly entering the deep lotus bay."

Li Qingzhao was originally from Zhangqiu County, Shandong. In the first year of the Daguang era (1107), she moved to Qingzhou with her husband and lived there for 14 years. She named her residence in Qingzhou "Yi'an Room" and referred to herself as "Yi'an Resident."

Li Qingzhao was a famous female poet during the Southern Song Dynasty.

　　李清照纪念馆在山东青州落成
    新华社济南５月１８日电（记者刘关权、张百新）一座李清照的纪念馆，日前在李清照的“第二故乡”——山东青州市揭幕。
    新落成的李清照纪念馆坐落在阳溪湖畔，由词廊、归来堂、金石斋、易安室、人杰亭等部分组成，占地３０００余平方米。归来堂内有用汉白玉雕刻的李清照和丈夫赵明诚在一起抚琴唱和的塑像。庭院栽植了芭蕉、菊花，湖内种植了荷花、浮萍，以体现李清照词中经常描述的“雨打芭蕉”、“误入藕湾深处”等幽雅意境。
    李清照原籍山东章丘县，大观元年（１１０７年），她随夫到青州生活了１４个春秋。她把青州的居室叫作“易安室”，并自称“易安居士”。
