Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 6th.

Tornadoes and heavy rain have struck several states in the southern United States over the past two days, resulting in at least 17 deaths.

On May 5th, tornadoes first hit North Carolina and South Carolina. Church steeples were snapped, large trees were uprooted, and cars were overturned. Nine people lost their lives in the storms.

Reports also indicate that Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana were similarly affected by tornadoes, with at least eight deaths, many of which were due to drowning.

The strong winds toppled 89 high-voltage power line towers, each standing 20 meters tall, causing power outages for 255,000 households in South Carolina, Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama.

The situation in Louisiana was particularly severe. The tornadoes brought heavy rain and hailstones as large as tennis balls. In some areas of the state, rainfall reached 30 centimeters in a single day.

Power outages were also most severe in Louisiana, with 50,000 households affected. The state's power company has been working on repairs, and so far, electricity has been restored to 12,000 households.
