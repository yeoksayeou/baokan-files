	Communicating with University Students' Hearts
	— President Chen Minheng of East China University of Chemical Technology Discusses "How Colleges Should Conduct Situation Education"

	By Xiaoguan Gen, Reporter for this Paper

	Grumbling reflects a lack of success and adaptation; both teachers and students need to be educated to adapt to the market economy

	Reporter: President Chen, I heard that you plan to conduct a theoretical training session for teachers this semester on "Understanding Socialism and Adapting to the Market Economy" to deepen the situation education. This is quite novel. Could you briefly discuss it?

	Chen Minheng: The theoretical training began on March 25. The first session is mainly for teachers from the Basic Education Department, with each session lasting two months. Courses such as "Theory and Practice of China's Economic Reform," "The Thirteenth Party Congress Line and Socialist Reform," and lectures on economics, ideology, and psychology will be offered. The plan is to train all teachers over four years. Starting next semester, the original four political courses will be changed to "History and National Conditions," "Analysis of Western Society," "Socialist Reform," and "Marxism and Philosophical Methodology."

	Teachers are the permanent residents of the school. To optimize the educational environment, we must first optimize the teaching staff. Universities are open and "unprotected" places. If teachers cannot understand and answer students' questions, such as when students ask for "realizing self-worth," and we only emphasize "dedication," the two do not align and cannot be combined. Therefore, to deepen situation education, we must train teachers.

	Question: You have often said that nine out of ten Chinese people have a problem: they do not understand socialism and do not adapt to the market economy, their mental state is unbalanced, and they have many complaints and grievances. One of the goals of situation education, and even the entire school education, is to address this issue, helping everyone to correctly understand socialism and cultivate a mindset that adapts to the market economy. Is my understanding correct?

	Answer: Yes, that's correct. I believe that university education is fundamentally an ideal education, educating students to strive for their ideals after graduation. However, the current problem is a lack of confidence in the country's development prospects and a focus on negative trends and corruption. Situation education aims to understand socialism from the perspective of historical development, recognizing that returning to the past rigid socialism is hopeless, and pursuing capitalism is also not feasible. Only by insisting on reform and taking the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, developing the market economy is inevitable. Most of us do not adapt to the market economy; we have formed a mindset of obedience to distribution and waiting for arrangements under the long-term planned economy; we are not proactive, and we are unwilling to take risks, but our expectations are high. If these expectations are not met, we blame others. Take students, for example; they are very dissatisfied with graduation assignments because they lack the freedom to choose their careers. After implementing "mutual selection," they say there are no good "parents" and cannot find good jobs, and they have many complaints, even to the point of disliking studying. In fact, not having good "parents" should motivate them to study harder and rely on their own abilities to find good jobs. This is a positive attitude. Teachers also have this situation; they are dissatisfied with the assigned work, but lack the courage to choose for themselves.

	I believe that grumbling is a sign of failure. The environment exists objectively, and merely complaining and blaming cannot adapt to or change the environment. Now the environment is much freer than before; how much have we utilized it? If our mindset is correct and we can adapt to the market economy, we will feel that there are many things we can do.

	Situation education should address students' ideological confusion and stimulate their rational thinking

	Question: You have mobilized cadres to "immerse" themselves among students for heart-to-heart talks, dialogues, and discussions, collecting over 300 questions. Can you analyze them?

	Answer: The questions students raised are many of the issues society is concerned about, and they ask more clearly, such as "Will we live in an era of severe inflation?" "What does the phenomenon of official profiteering signify?" "What are the essential differences between the fairness and efficiency of socialism and capitalism?" "Is China's reform a combination of the shortcomings of socialism and the advantages of capitalism?" and so on. These questions have obvious political implications and a deep cultural and psychological background. From the questions raised, it is clear that university students' mindset is not adapted to the market economy. However, their desire to find answers and correct their mindset is more urgent than that of ordinary people. Because they are all young people, their lives are just beginning. If they do not have a good psychological quality before entering society, they will suffer greatly in the future.

	Question: From this perspective, university students are very willing to accept situation education, but university students are intellectually active and like to think deeply, and they have many ideological confusions. If, like in the past, we use a top-down approach to indoctrinate them with simple answers, the effect may not be significant, and it may even cause resentment.

	Answer: When designing situation education, we considered this situation and made efforts to explore new content and forms. Our responsibility is not to provide students with answers; to be honest, we cannot explain these questions clearly. We can only provide them with materials for reflection and help them make correct choices. We organized an economic and cultural series of lectures themed "Confusion, Reflection, Choice." The economic series of lectures focused on the hotspots and doubts in the reform situation that students are most concerned about, helping everyone to eliminate ideological confusion. Some lectures were very popular. The cultural series of lectures covered five topics: "New Liberalism," "Socialist Equality," "Social Choice and Personal Choice," "The Realm of Self," and "Life, Confusion, and Pursuit." This series of lectures aims to provide students with theoretical knowledge and a framework for thinking about the reform situation and making correct choices. Students' reactions to the cultural series of lectures were: to understand the reform, rational reflection is needed, not just high talk upon seeing phenomena.

	Abandoning indoctrination, using systematic lectures and discussions to help students establish a sense of responsibility and not easily shift blame to others

	Question: As far as I know, you have made quite adequate preparations for these two series of lectures, and the cultural series of lectures has already published five books. However, is this approach still a form of indoctrination?

	Answer: The so-called indoctrination refers to only presenting one viewpoint, theory, or proposition and requiring everyone to accept it without choice. Our approach is not indoctrination. Because our series of lectures emphasize systematicness, that is, to conduct longitudinal historical analysis and horizontal comparison, in addition to introducing Marxism, we also introduce various schools of thought, allowing everyone to choose. In addition to lectures, there are various student self-education and equal discussion activities. Some students have read many books and are eloquent, but their understanding is one-sided. We organize them to participate in the "Social Perception Discussion Class" to discuss how to evaluate the reform situation and other issues in an objective manner. There are also some students who have many ideas but are not good at expressing themselves. We invite various experts and social celebrities to conduct a "Socialism Reform and Our Choices" social life consultation once a month. We adopt an individual consultation method to allow them to fully express their doubts and views.

	These approaches make students feel a sense of participation and pride and will not feel that it is "external indoctrination."

	Recently, some students have objections to the school's regulation that students who do not pass the four-level English test will not be issued a graduation certificate or degree certificate, and they wrote a satirical poem to me: "If you don't pass the four-level, no 'certificate' will be given, the student has no fault, the school has the fault." I wrote an open letter in response, asking everyone to discuss and analyze "whose fault is it?" Because this matter reflects a mindset. No matter what happens, one does not take responsibility but always blames others, blames the school, and blames the country. This is an abnormal mindset that has been cultivated over a long period. Now, cadres, teachers, and students are all discussing it. The Academic Affairs Office discovered and publicly corrected an error related to the English exam issue five years ago during the discussion. Students' views have also changed, and they wrote another satirical poem: "If you don't pass the four-level, the school has no fault, no certificate is given, the school has the fault."

	Systematic lectures combined with discussions of actual school problems will not make students feel that they are being indoctrinated from a high position, and the effect may be better.

	Question: Nowadays, everyone is conducting situation education, but the effects are different. The reasons are multifaceted. Some people believe that this is related to the good or bad work of a unit and the good or bad style of leadership. If the work is sloppy and the style is not upright, the masses will not look at you favorably, and even if the principles you speak are correct, everyone will not listen. This is called to enter the ears and brain, and you must first enter the eyes. Is this reasoning reasonable?

	Answer: This reasoning is reasonable. Many of the masses' views on the situation are actually caused by our mistakes in work and improper practices. You have many problems yourself, and educating the masses lacks persuasiveness. The good work of a unit can also inspire the masses' confidence in the future. We filmed and broadcasted a video reflecting the school's reform process and achievements, "Walking Out of the Valley." After everyone watched it, there was a saying: "If the East China University of Chemical Technology can walk out of the valley, our country also has hope to walk out of the valley." On the other hand, situation education also prompts us to do a good job, deepen the reform. The focus of this semester is to "rectify work order and optimize the educational environment."

　　与大学生沟通心灵    
    ——华东化工学院院长陈敏恒谈“高校如何开展形势教育”
    本报记者  萧关根
    　　　　牢骚反映了不成功不适应，师生都有必要接受适应商品经济的教育
    记者：陈院长，听说你们要在这个学期对教师进行“理解社会主义、适应商品经济”的文化心理的理论集训，以便把形势教育引向深入。这倒是件新鲜事，你能简单谈谈吗？
    陈敏恒：理论集训在３月２５日正式开始。第一期主要是基础教育部的教师，每期集训两个月，要开设《我国经济体制改革的理论与实践》、《十三大路线与社会主义改革》等课程，还要办经济、思想、心理等讲座。打算在４年中把教师集训一遍。从下学期起，准备把原来的四门政治课改为《历史与国情》、《西方社会分析》、《社会主义的改革》、《马克思主义与哲学方法论》。
    教师是学校的长住户口。优化育人环境首先要优化教师队伍。大学是开放的又是“不设防”的场所。教师对学生提出的问题无法理解和回答，如学生提出要“实现自我价值”，而我们的教师只是强调“奉献”。两者对不上号，也结合不起来。因此，形势教育要深入，就必须训练教师。
    问：你曾多次说过，中国人十之八九有一种病，就是不理解社会主义，不适应商品经济，心态不平衡，牢骚多，怨言多。形势教育以至整个学校教育的目的之一，就是要治这种病。使大家正确理解社会主义，培养适应商品经济的心态。不知我这样理解对不对？
    答：是这样。我认为，大学教育从根本上说是一种理想教育，是教育学生毕业以后为实现自己的理想而奋斗。但是，现在的问题是对国家的发展前途信心不足，对不正之风、腐败现象看得很重。形势教育，就想从历史的发展来理解社会主义，认识到再回到过去那种僵化的社会主义是没有希望的，搞资本主义也不行。只有坚持改革，走中国特色的社会主义道路，发展商品经济是不可避免的。我们多数人不适应商品经济，他们在长期的计划经济下形成了一种服从分配，等待安排的心理状态；不是去主动进取，更不愿冒风险，但期望又很高，达不到期望就怨天尤人。就以学生来说，对于毕业分配很不满，因为没有选择职业的自由；试行“双向选择”以后，又说没有好爸爸，找不到好工作，牢骚很多，以致厌学。其实，没有好爸爸应该更努力学习，凭自己的真本事来求得好工作。这才是积极的态度。教师也有这种情况，给他安排工作不满意，要他自己选择又缺少勇气。
    我认为牢骚是不成功的表现。环境是客观存在，一味地埋怨指责并不能适应和改变环境。现在的环境比过去自由度大多了，我们到底利用了多少？心态端正了，能适应商品经济了，就会感到有许多事情可做。
    　　　　形势教育应针对学生的思想困惑，启发他们的理性思索
    问：你们曾动员干部“沉”到学生中谈心、对话、座谈，共收集了３００多个问题。能否分析一下？
    答：学生提出的问题很多是全社会关心的问题，他们提得更明确，如“我们会生活在恶性的通货膨胀时代吗？”“官倒现象说明了什么？”“社会主义与资本主义的公平和效率有什么本质区别？”“中国改革是不是社会主义的缺点加资本主义的优点？”等等。这些问题有很明显的政治性，也有比较深刻的文化心理背景。从所提问题看出大学生的心态是不适应商品经济。但是他们希望求得答案和端正心态的要求比一般人要迫切得多。因为他们都是青年人，生活道路刚刚开始。如果在踏上社会前没有比较好的心理素质，今后会十分苦恼的。
    问：从这一点上说，大学生是很愿意接受形势教育的，但是，大学生思想活跃，又喜欢思索，思想上的困惑很多。如果像过去那样采用居高临下灌输的办法，给他们一个简单的答案，恐怕收效不大，还会引起反感。
    答：在设计形势教育时，我们想到了这种情况，努力在教育内容和形式上有新的探索。我们的责任不是为学生提供答案，老实说，这些问题我们是无法讲清楚的，只能为他们提供思索的材料，帮助他们自己作出正确的选择。我们举办了以“困惑、思索、选择”为主题的经济、文化系列讲座。经济系列讲座是针对学生最关心的改革形势中的热点和疑点，帮助大家消除思想上的困惑，有的讲座很受欢迎。文化系列讲座讲了５个问题：“新自由论”、“社会主义平等”、“社会选择与个人选择”，“自我的境界”、“人生、困惑与追求”。这个系列讲座是想为学生提供思索改革形势，作出正确选择的理论知识和思维框架。学生听了文化系列讲座的反应是：要理解改革，就需要理性思索，而不是看到现象就发高论。
    　　　　摒弃灌输法，以系统讲座和讨论帮助学生树立责任感，不轻易诿过
    　　于人
    问：据我所知，对于这两个系列讲座，你们是作了比较充分准备的，文化系列讲座已出了５本书。但是，这种做法是不是仍属于灌输？
    答：所谓灌输，是指只讲一种观点、理论或主张，要大家别无选择地接受。我们的做法不是灌输。因为我们的系列讲座强调系统性，就是要作纵向的历史的分析，又作横向的比较，除了讲马克思主义外，还要介绍各种思想流派，让大家选择。此外，除了讲座，还有各种学生自我教育、平等探讨的活动。有些学生读过一些书，能言善辩，但认识比较片面。我们组织他们参加“社会认知研讨班”，实事求是地讨论如何评价改革形势等问题。还有一些学生有许多想法但又不善言辩，我们聘请各种专家、社会名流每月进行一次“社会主义改革与我们的选择”的社会人生咨询。采取个别答疑的方式让他们尽情地诉说心中的疑问，表达自己的看法。
    这些做法使学生有一种参与感、自豪感，不会感到是“外在灌输”。
    最近，部分学生对学校规定四级英语统考不合格者不给毕业证书和学位证书的做法有意见，给我写了一首打油诗：“四级不过，‘证书’不给，学生无过，学校有过。”我就此写了一封公开信，请大家讨论分析“谁之过？”因为，这件事反映了一种心态。无论什么事情，自己不承担责任，总是责怪别人，责怪学校，责怪国家。这是长期养成的一种不正常的心态。现在机关干部、教师和学生都在讨论，教务长办公室在讨论中发现并公开纠正了５年前有关英语考试问题的一个失误。学生的看法也有了变化，他们又写了一首打油诗：“四级不过，学校无过，证书不给，学校有过。”
    系统讲座结合讨论学校中的实际问题，就不会使学生感到是居高临下的“灌输”，也许效果会好一点。
    问：现在都在搞形势教育，但效果不一样。原因是多方面的。有种意见认为，这与一个单位工作的好坏和领导作风的好坏有很大关系。工作马马虎虎，作风又不正，群众对你看不顺眼，你讲的道理即使是正确的，大家也听不进去。这就叫要入耳入脑，还得先入眼。这种讲法有道理吗？
    答：这种讲法有道理。群众中对形势的不少看法，实际上是由于我们工作上的失误和不正之风引起。你自己有许多问题，对群众进行教育缺少说服力。本单位工作有成绩也能鼓舞群众对前途的信心。我们拍摄、播放了反映学校改革进程和成果的录像《走出低谷》，大家看了以后有个说法：“化工学院能走出低谷，我们国家也有希望走出低谷。”从另一方面讲，形势教育也促使我们搞好工作，深化改革，我们这个学期的重点是“整顿工作秩序，优化育人环境。”
