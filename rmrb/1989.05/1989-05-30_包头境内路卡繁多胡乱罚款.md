In mid-March, after completing all the necessary procedures, we drove two trucks to Chifeng City to deliver goods. Along the way, we suffered numerous fines. During this delivery trip, we were fined over thirty times, totaling more than 1,500 yuan.

Our cargo trucks were approved by the traffic management, epidemic prevention, and industrial and commercial tax departments at the banner and league levels. However, some traffic police arbitrarily imposed fines on us. In Kunduolun District, Baotou City, we were fined almost every time we passed a traffic police checkpoint. When we told the police, "We have already paid a fine up ahead," some officers would say, "He is he, and I am I; each manages his own." We had no choice but to pay. Otherwise, some officers would say our attitude was bad and double the fine. These fines were issued without receipts or any formal procedures!

    包头境内路卡繁多胡乱罚款
    三月中旬，我们办妥了各种手续后，开着两辆汽车往赤峰市送货，沿途吃尽了被罚款的苦头。在这次送货途中，我们共被罚款三十多次，罚款总额达一千五百多元。
    我们的货车送货是经旗、盟两级交通管理、卫生防疫、工商税务等部门同意的。但是，有些交通民警随意让我们交纳罚款。在包头市昆独仑区，我们几乎每过一个交通警岗，就挨罚一次。我们对民警说：“我们在前面已经交过罚款了。”有的民警却说：“他是他，我是我，各管各的。”我们只好掏钱。否则，有的民警就会说你态度不好，加倍罚款。这些罚款不开收据，也没有任何手续！
