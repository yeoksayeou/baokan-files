On the night of May 9, the northeastern U.S. city of Boston experienced a false alarm. A man with a gun flew a small plane at low altitude, harassing the city, and repeatedly fired a rifle at the ground for three hours, causing great panic among the citizens. The plane flew over several busy areas and even passed under a 40-meter-high bridge. No citizens were injured, but several buildings were damaged by gunfire.

According to the police, the man piloting the plane was Henry, aged 42. That evening at 9:30 PM, he killed his wife and fled, driving a stolen car to an airport 50 kilometers away from Boston. He then boarded a small private plane parked at the airport, flew towards New Hampshire, and later returned, circling over Boston. Commercial flights were disrupted, and the airport was unable to take off or land for an entire hour. Henry was eventually forced to land when his plane's fuel was almost exhausted and was arrested by the police. On the morning of the 10th, he was charged with murder and theft.

　　亨利驾机骚扰  波城一场虚惊
    ５月９日夜间，美国东北部名城波士顿经受一场虚惊。一名带枪的男子驾着小型飞机低空飞行，骚扰市区，不断用步枪向地面射击，前后达三个小时，市民大为惊恐。飞机多次掠过闹区，并从一座高４０米的大桥下穿过。市民无一伤亡，几座大楼遭枪击受损。
    据警方称，驾机男子名亨利，４２岁，当晚９时３０分杀妻逃走，驾驶偷来的小汽车到达离波士顿５０公里的机场，登上一架停在机场的小型私人飞机，飞向新罕布什尔州，后又折回，在波士顿附近盘旋。航班客机被阻，整整一个小时机场不能起降。亨利最后在飞机汽油所剩无几时被迫降落，被警察抓获。１０日上午，他被控犯有杀人、偷盗罪。
