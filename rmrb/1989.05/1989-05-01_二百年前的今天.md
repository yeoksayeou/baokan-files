Today, the history of 200 years ago is being reenacted in New York.

It was noon, the sun was high, and the spring sunshine was bright. A horse-drawn carriage from afar suddenly stopped in front of the "Federal Hall Memorial" building in New York. A tall, silver-haired figure dressed in a deep brown suit stepped out of the carriage. He was the founding father of the United States, George Washington. Of course, historical figures cannot be resurrected; he was played by an actor who closely resembled Washington. Washington, full of vigor, entered the Federal Hall and was warmly welcomed by the 26 representatives (actors) of the original 13 states of America. He took the oath of office as the first president of the United States and delivered an inaugural address. The square was filled with the sound of 50 cannons firing, creating an unprecedented spectacle.

Then, people returned from 200 years ago to the present. In New York, a grand parade was held. They started from the "Federal Hall Memorial" building on Wall Street, passed through many avenues, and arrived at Washington Square.

This was the main activity to celebrate the 200th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration as the first president of the United States. The event was organized by the New York City Government, which was proud to have been the capital at that time. They allocated $3.5 million for the celebration and invested a large amount of manpower. Various sectors of American society also attached great importance to it. President Bush and many members of Congress specially traveled from the current capital, Washington, D.C., to attend the ceremony.

The reporter was invited to participate in this grand event and felt honored to witness the scene from 200 years ago. At the same time, with a curious mind, the reporter asked American friends: Why is the current celebration so grand? A friend said that this is to conduct patriotic education for the younger generation of Americans, because many young Americans today do not know much about or pay much attention to the history of the founding of the United States. Washington led the American people in a bloody struggle to overthrow British colonial rule and formally declare the establishment of the United States of America.

Yesterday, James Flexner, the author of "The Life of Washington," wrote in The New York Times that Washington was a national hero who created an indelible legacy by establishing the United States of America and preventing the states from splitting.

The 41st President of the United States, Bush, gave a brief speech at today's ceremony, praising Washington's foresight, composure, and integrity in establishing an effective government, setting an example for future American presidents. He called for bipartisan cooperation in governing the country and urged the American people to uphold the spirit of service and traditional values. He said, "The measure of success is not the quantity of our possessions, nor our position or occupation, but the good deeds we do for others."

　　二百年前的今天
    本报记者  刘开宸
    今天，２００年前的历史在纽约重现。
    正是中午，白日当空，春光明媚，从远道而来的一辆马车突然在纽约的“联邦纪念堂”大楼前停下，从马车内走出一位满头银发、身着深咖啡色礼服的魁梧人物，他就是美国的开国元勋乔治·华盛顿。历史人物当然不能复活，他是由酷似华盛顿的一位演员扮演的。华盛顿神采奕奕，步入联邦大厅，受到当时美国１３州的２６位代表（扮演者）的热烈欢迎，宣誓就任美国第一任总统，并发表就职演说，广场上５０响礼炮齐鸣，盛况空前。
    接着，人们又从２００年前回到了现实，在纽约举行了盛大的游行。他们从“联邦纪念堂”大楼前的华尔街出发，穿过许多大道，到达华盛顿广场。
    这是庆祝华盛顿就任美国第一任总统２００周年的主要活动。主办单位是纽约市政府。他们以纽约是当时的首都而自豪，为这次庆祝拨经费３５０万美元，并投入大量人力。美国各界也颇为重视，布什总统和国会的许多议员特地从现在的首都华盛顿赶来参加庆典。
    记者应邀参加了这次盛典，为能亲睹２００年前盛况而感到荣幸，同时怀着好奇的心理向美国朋友们探问：目前的庆祝典礼，何必如此隆重？一位朋友说，这是为了对美国年轻一代进行爱国主义教育，因为现在许多美国年轻人对美国建国历史不很了解，也不很重视。华盛顿当时领导美国人，经过艰苦流血的斗争，才推翻了英国殖民地统治，正式宣布建立美利坚合众国。
    《华盛顿传》一书的作者詹姆斯·弗莱克斯纳昨天在《纽约时报》撰文指出，华盛顿是民族英雄，为创建美利坚合众国、阻止各州分裂建立了不朽的功勋。
    美国第４１任总统布什在今天的庆典上，发表了简短讲话，赞扬华盛顿的远见、镇静和正直，建立了有效能的政府，为美国后来的总统们树立了榜样。他呼吁两党合作治理国家，号召美国人民发扬服务精神和传统价值观念。他说，“衡量成功的标准不是我们财产的数量，也不是我们的地位或职业，而是我们为他人所做的好事”。
