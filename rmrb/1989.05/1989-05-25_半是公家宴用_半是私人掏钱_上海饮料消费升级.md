Although many people on the streets of Shanghai are still dressed in spring clothes, the "summer" of beverages has already arrived. The daily sales of beverages at Shanghai's largest food store have reached nearly 20,000 yuan. The Tai Chang Food Company, known as the "beverage king of Nanjing Road," had its beverage sales in early spring this year reach the level of last year's summer.

A recent authoritative report from the city's commercial department predicts that this year, the average Shanghai resident will consume over 21 kilograms of beverages, an increase of nearly 20% from last year. Currently, there are over 200 regular enterprises producing beverages in Shanghai, and more than 300 varieties from various regions are competing in this large market.

A trend towards diversified and branded beverages is clearly emerging. Once-popular generic and low-quality beverages are being phased out, and homemade syrups, orange juices, and crystal powders that many families used to enjoy have become outdated. The sales of branded beverages like "Pepsi-Cola," "Sprite," and "Fanta" are on the rise.

Industry insiders note that the steady increase in purchasing power and modern consumption concepts have led Shanghai residents to gradually change their single-beverage habit of drinking plain tea. The opening of hotels, the rise of various restaurants and dance halls, and the widespread use of home refrigerators have all created broad opportunities for beverage consumption. The annual "preventive summer heat" beverage distribution and various public-funded purchases have also stimulated people's desire to consume modern-tasting beverages. According to a survey by relevant departments, about half of the current high-end beverage purchasers in Shanghai are for official banquets, and the other half is for personal consumption. A store manager explained that for the same "Coca-Cola," those who buy cans are mostly for official use, while individuals buying large plastic bottles are more common.

Shanghai residents have mixed opinions on the current phenomenon of "half public, half private" in beverage consumption. Some say that beverages are also a normal part of social interactions between enterprises and units, and as long as they comply with financial regulations, there is no need for additional constraints. Many citizens believe that the large-scale public-funded beverage consumption has a negative "demonstration effect," pushing Shanghai's beverage consumption to mature too quickly. Some "insiders" can even move boxes of public-funded beverages into their own refrigerators, harming the state and the public. High-end beverages that cost several yuan per bottle or can are hardly affordable for ordinary consumers on a daily basis.

### 半是公家宴用　半是私人掏钱  上海饮料消费升级

　　半是公家宴用　半是私人掏钱
    上海饮料消费升级
    新华社上海５月２５日电  （记者汪洪洋）眼下，虽然上海街头许多人还身着春装，但饮料的“夏天”却已来临。上海最大的食品一店饮料日销量已近２万元。号称“南京路上饮料大王”的泰昌食品公司，在今年早春２月，饮料销售额就已等于往年炎夏水平。
    市商业部门一份权威性预测报告日前说，今年１２００万上海人平均每人饮用的饮料将突破２１公斤，比去年提高近２０％。现在，仅上海就有２００多家正规企业生产饮料，来自各地的３００多个花色品种的饮料正在这个大市场展开激烈竞争。
    一个追求饮料多样化、名牌化的新趋势已明显出现。一度招摇过市的杂牌、劣质饮料已在淘汰之列，往年多数人家自行调制享用过的糖浆、桔汁、晶粉等饮料也已落伍，“百事可乐”、“雪碧”、“芬达”等名牌饮料的销量日见其高。
    注视这一热潮的商业界人士指出，稳步上升的购买力和时新的消费观念，使上海人逐渐改变了清茶一杯的单一饮料习惯。宾馆的开放，各类餐厅、舞厅的兴起，家用电冰箱的普及，也造成广泛的饮料消费机会；而一年一度的“防暑”饮料发放和各种公款购买，更刺激了人们对各类现代口味饮料的消费欲望。有关部门调查表明，目前上海各类高档饮料的购买者中，大约一半属公家宴用，一半是私人消费。一位商店经理介绍说：同一种“可口可乐”，买易拉罐的多是公家，自己掏钱都买大塑料瓶包装的。
    上海人对目前饮料消费中“公一半，私一半”的现象评论不一。有人说：饮料也是企业单位之间社交往来的正常消费，只要符合财务制度，就可顺其自然，不必强加约束。比较多的市民认为，大量的公款饮料消费，起了不良的“示范效应”，催促上海人饮料水平过快“早熟”。一些“有门道的人”还能把公费饮料一箱箱搬进自家的冰箱，坑了国家，亏了大家，动辄几元钱一瓶一罐的高级饮料，一般消费者谁能日常受用？
