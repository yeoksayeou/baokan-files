The trend of gift-giving has become a significant social burden in recent years. Particularly during festive seasons, the variety of gifts and their increasing costs have become a heavy burden for residents. The "social etiquette expenses" of residents have surpassed the growth rate of their actual income, making it an unbearable social burden for many.

Currently, the "social etiquette expenses" of urban residents have seen a substantial increase. In 1983, the per capita expenditure on "social etiquette" in our province's urban areas was 15 yuan. By 1988, this had risen to 57 yuan. During the Spring Festival, we surveyed 15 households in Changchun City, and found that 12 of them had expenditures on "social etiquette," averaging 144 yuan per household.

Faced with the numerous occasions for gift-giving, most residents secretly lament the burden but still follow the trend. Whether it's red envelope money, kneeling money, New Year's greetings money, or pocket money, they all give without hesitation. Taking the red envelope money during the Spring Festival as an example: among the surveyed residents, the minimum amount given was 20 yuan, while the maximum ranged from 200 yuan, 300 yuan, to even over 1,000 yuan. Due to the prevalence of this gift-giving culture, even young children who have just begun to understand the world have learned to demand "gifts." This shows that the people genuinely wish to curb the trend of social etiquette and gift-giving.

    送礼之风已经成为社会负担
    近年来，请客送礼之风愈演愈烈，特别是逢年过节期间，名目繁多，价码陡涨。居民的
  “人情费”支出超过实际收入的增长幅度，已成为人们不堪忍受的一种社会负担。
    现在，城镇居民的“人情费”支出大幅度上升，一九八三年，我省城镇居民人均支出
  “人情费”为十五元；到一九八八年增加到五十七元。我们在春节期间抽查了长春市十五户居民家庭，有“人情费”支出的达十二户，平均每户支出一百四十四元。
    面对名目繁多的请客送礼，大多数居民都暗中叫苦不迭，但行动上还得随风就俗。什么压岁钱、磕头钱、拜年钱、压兜钱等，照拿不误。仅以春节期间压岁钱为例：在抽查的居民中，少者给二十元，多者给二百元、三百元以至上千元不等。由于礼风盛行，使刚刚懂事的孩子也学会了要“礼”。由此可见，不搞人情风、送礼风，已成为民众意愿。
