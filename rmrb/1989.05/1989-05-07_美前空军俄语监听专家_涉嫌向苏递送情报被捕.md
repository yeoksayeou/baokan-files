Federal Bureau of Investigation sources revealed that a former U.S. Air Force Russian language monitoring expert was arrested for passing top-secret intelligence to the Soviets.

The 34-year-old Wolf was arrested on the afternoon of the 5th in a hotel near Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.

The FBI claimed that although Wolf had not come into contact with anyone from the Soviet Union, he had handed over intelligence to an individual disguised as a Soviet agent by FBI personnel.

Wolf joined the Air Force in 1974 but was discharged in 1981 due to financial issues. Before his arrest, he was a used car salesman.

The FBI believes that Wolf did this for money and to seek revenge against the U.S. government.

This incident occurred just before Secretary of State Baker's visit to Moscow. The Soviet side has not yet responded.

　　美前空军俄语监听专家    
    涉嫌向苏递送情报被捕
    新华社华盛顿５月６日电  联邦调查局人士透露，美国一名前空军俄语监听专家因向苏联人递送绝密情报而被捕。
    今年３４岁的沃尔夫是于５日下午在达拉斯—福特沃斯国际机场附近的一家旅馆里被捕的。
    联邦调查局方面声称，尽管沃尔夫没有同任何来自苏联的人接触过，但他却把情报交给了一名由联邦调查局人员装扮的苏联特工人员。
    沃尔夫于１９７４年加入空军，但因经济问题于１９８１年被开除除名。他在被逮捕前是一名旧车推销商。
    联邦调查局认为，沃尔夫之所以这么干一是为了金钱，二是企图对美国政府进行报复。
    这一事件恰好发生在贝克国务卿即将访问莫斯科之前。苏联方面尚未作出任何反应。
