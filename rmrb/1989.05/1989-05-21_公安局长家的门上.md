A column by Hu Keming

Pan Zhaoqiang, the director of the Public Security Bureau in Taixing County, Jiangsu, is a national outstanding public security director and a first-class merit awardee. He earned that certificate with gold embossing, symbolizing the highest honor of Chinese police, not only through his outstanding case-solving abilities, but also through the integrity of a Communist Party member.

Old Pan lives in the town of Jiangyan, on South Street 174. Before entering the house, a notice in black ink on white paper catches the eye: "No public matters discussed at home, gifts and favors are unwelcome. Please forgive the host."

Though this old man is usually amiable and smiling, he always brings small gifts for his loved ones and grandchildren after a long trip to express his affection. However, as soon as someone brings up "business," he immediately changes his demeanor. Pan Zhaoqiang's parents passed away early, and he and his two siblings relied on each other. He especially dotes on his younger sister, who is about to retire. Once, his younger sister, at someone's request, spoke to her brother for the first time, asking him to help with a rural-to-urban household registration. To her surprise, her brother sternly rebuked her: "Mind your own business, don't meddle in these affairs!" The sudden change in attitude made his sister's eyes well up with tears.

For the first time in 30 years, Pan Zhaoqiang got angry with his sister, who had never spoken harshly to him before. He felt a bit regretful when they met again and talked at length: "Things that cannot be done, I will not do, you know my temper. Even if it is a matter that can be handled according to policy, once you open your mouth, it becomes difficult to handle. Think about it: matters that should be handled according to policy are right and proper. But if personal interventions are involved, it easily gives the other party a wrong impression. This is tantamount to trivializing a serious policy matter. Don't you think so?" His words convinced his sister.

The notice on the door couldn't stop the hurried footsteps of visitors. People still came in the mornings, evenings, and holidays, choosing times when Old Pan was out on business, using various tactics to visit and discuss matters. One morning, a visitor brought expensive gifts to the door. After a few pleasantries, he left the gifts and hurriedly left, startling Pan Zhaoqiang's wife, who quickly stopped him, saying, "Take your things and go, you know Old Pan's temper, don't make him angry." "Oh, it's not for him, I'm giving it to the children." The visitor cleverly evaded. The sound of polite refusals woke up Pan Zhaoqiang, who had just fallen asleep after being on duty all night. He stuck his head out from the quilt and shouted, "Why are you bothering with him? Throw him out!" "Just talk nicely, why offend the visitor?" Every time Old Pan offended those persistent visitors, his wife would scold him a few words. Old Pan said, "I can't help it, seeing these people makes me sick." What can be done? This is Pan Zhaoqiang's nature. Sometimes, when his two sons' friends come to play, he also calls his son aside: "Are they looking for you? Or are they trying to find me through you? If they are looking for me, you better stay away."

These actions often made his family feel embarrassed. But his family members, children, and relatives all understood him, respected him, and supported him, helping him polish that blue shield to keep it shining.

### 公安局长家的门上

　　公安局长家的门上
    胡克明
    江苏泰县公安局长潘兆祥是全国优秀公安局长、一等功臣。他取得那本烫金的标志着中国警察最高荣誉的证书，不只凭卓绝的破案才能，还凭一个共产党员的一身正气。
    老潘家住县城姜堰镇南大街１７４号。未入家门，一张白纸黑字的“打招呼”便跃入眼帘：“家里不谈公事，请吃送礼讨厌。请原谅本户主人。”
    别看这老头平时和蔼可亲，一脸笑容，一趟远差回来总要给至爱亲朋、孙男孙女送上点小礼物，以表心意。可只要一和他提起“事”，他就马上翻脸。潘兆祥父母早亡，兄妹三人相依为命，感情很深。他尤其疼爱如今快退休的小妹妹。有一次，小妹妹受人之托，头一次向哥哥开口，请他抬抬手，帮人家解决一个农转非户口。想不到，哥哥厉声训斥：“你给我少多事，这些事不要你问！”突如其来的翻脸，委屈得妹妹眼泪汪汪。
    对３０年来从没有高言过一声的妹妹第一次发了火，潘兆祥也有点后悔，兄妹再会时，他和她谈了好久：“不能办的事，我坚决不办，你是了解我脾气的。就是按政策能办的事，你开了口，反而不好办了。你想想：符合政策该办的事，办了，是应该的。但这里面若掺杂了你们说情的因素后，就容易给对方产生一种错觉。这等于把严肃的政策性庸俗化了。你说是不是？……”一席话说得妹妹心悦诚服。
    “打招呼”虽贴在门上，但也挡不住门客们的匆匆脚步，仍然有人利用早上晚上和假日，选择老潘出差的机会，采取形形色色的手段上门套近乎，谈事情。一天早上，拎着贵重礼品的客人上了门。寒暄几句后，丢下东西就走，慌得潘兆祥的老伴忙拖住他，说：“你把东西拿走，老潘的脾气你知道，不要弄得红了脸。”“哎，又不是给他的，我是送给孩子的。”客人巧妙地周旋。谦让声惊醒了值班至天亮刚睡着的潘兆祥，他在被窝里探起身子吼道：“跟他罗嗦什么，把他轰出去！”“好好说么，何必得罪上门的客人呢？”每次老潘冲撞了那些死皮赖脸的门客后，老伴都免不了说他几句。老潘说：“我忍不住，见到这些人，我恶心。”有什么办法呢，这就是潘兆祥的本性。有时他两个儿子的朋友找上门来玩，他也把儿子叫到一边：“是找你的？还是想通过你找我的？要是找我的，你给我趁早回远些。”
    这些举动经常弄得家人很难堪。但家属子女和亲朋好友都理解他，尊重他，也支持他，和他一道擦拭那枚蓝色盾牌，让它保持应有的光泽。
