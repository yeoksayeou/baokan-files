The Soviet Union has made efforts to rescue over 300 Soviet prisoners of war held in Afghanistan. So far, 25 have been released, and the Soviet side continues to work on rescuing the remaining prisoners.

This information was disclosed in a written statement released by the Soviet Embassy in Pakistan.

The statement said that the Soviet side has repeatedly requested assistance in finding and releasing the prisoners of war during talks with Pakistan, Iran, and other Muslim countries. The Soviet Union has also appealed to the leaders of Western countries, including the U.S. President, the Chancellor of West Germany, the British Prime Minister, and the Canadian Prime Minister, asking for their help in rescuing these prisoners of war. The Soviet Union has made similar requests to United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and PLO leader Yasser Arafat, among other international figures.

The statement also mentioned that the Soviet Union has negotiated with the Afghan Mujahideen through various channels regarding the release of prisoners of war. However, due to the Mujahideen's intention to use the prisoners as political leverage, the Soviet efforts have not been successful.

　　苏设法营救侵阿战俘
    本报伊斯兰堡５月１２日电  记者任毓骏报道：经过多方努力，迄今为止侵阿苏军３００多名战俘中有２５人获释，苏方仍为营救战俘而继续努力。
    上述信息是苏联驻巴基斯坦使馆在此间散发的一份书面声明中披露的。
    这份声明说，苏联方面曾在和巴基斯坦、伊朗以及其他穆斯林国家的会谈中多次提出要求协助寻找并释放战俘。苏联还向美国总统、西德总理、英国首相和加拿大总理等西方国家领导人发出呼吁，请求他们帮助营救这些战俘。苏联还向联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔、巴解组织领导人阿拉法特等国际知名人士发出同样的请求。
    声明还说，苏联也曾通过种种渠道和阿富汗游击队方面谈判释放战俘问题。但是，由于游击队方面想把战俘作为政治筹码，苏联的努力未产生效果。
