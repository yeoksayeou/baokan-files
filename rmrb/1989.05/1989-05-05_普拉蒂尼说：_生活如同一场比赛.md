The "football magician" Platini has been a prominent figure in the football world for many years, becoming an idol for fans in France and around the world. In 649 professional football matches, he scored 353 goals, leaving a deep impression on people's minds. On May 17, 1987, he announced his retirement, resolutely stepping away from the intense competition of the football field and entering a new phase of life. He once said, "Life is like a game," and he wants to "try new things as much as possible" and "find the best balance between his family and his personal endeavors."

Platini's life is rich and varied. He manages his time according to his own wishes. In addition to focusing on his family and the education of his children, he has also ventured into the media, operates a sports equipment company, invests in multiple enterprises, and engages in social welfare activities, all while participating in new "games" on several fronts.

He has "always wanted to understand the world behind the camera" and is particularly interested in television and broadcasting. He collaborated with a television station to interview world-renowned figures. Based on a contract signed with a television station, in November of the previous year, Platini went to Zurich to provide commentary for a football match. In late January of the following year, during the intense battle between the Liverpool and Arsenal teams, Platini's vivid commentary greatly satisfied the audience. At the final whistle, fans cheered not only for the winners but also called out Platini's name, expressing their admiration.

In Platini's own words, he is also a "businessman." With his years of savings, he operates the Saint-Cyprien, "Grand Stade," and "Platini 10" sportswear joint ventures. Sportswear bearing his name has already appeared on the market. He personally visits major European cities to expand the market and plans to promote his brand across Europe.

The "Platini Foundation" was established in early 1987. It is a public welfare organization that openly declares war on drug abuse and helps young drug addicts return to society. Over the past two years, Platini has used his influence to provide education and over a hundred types of vocational training, helping more than 200 young people who have quit drugs return to enterprises and become producers. The foundation's advertisements, records, videotapes, and films have received positive feedback from society. Platini once said he is "not Zorro," but he is willing to help some young people overcome drug addiction both materially and spiritually. Platini's noble actions can be seen as another "beautiful goal" he scored in the game of life.

Just 18 months after retiring from football, Platini returned to the fiery football field in November of the following year to serve as the head coach of the French national team. People say that Platini took on this role in a time of crisis and will play the role of a "savior." However, in his own view, "football, like the earth, is round, and without Platini, French football will continue to spin." He asks people not to treat him as the "umbrella" of the French football team. Given the current state of the French team, it is very difficult to qualify for the World Cup. Many friends advised him not to take on this task, but Platini replied: "I know there is only risk." But "I love my country," and "I cannot refuse when France needs my help." Platini bravely accepted the task and immediately began recruiting and training a new team, assembling it in just over ten days.

In the World Cup qualifiers, France was grouped with Scotland, Yugoslavia, Norway, and Cyprus in Group 5. The initial results were quite disappointing. The French team won 1-0 against Norway, drew with Cyprus, and lost to Scotland and Yugoslavia. On April 29, at the Prince's Park Stadium in Paris, France played Yugoslavia again. This was essentially France's last chance. Unfortunately, France could not score a single goal against the "impenetrable wall." The match ended in a 0-0 draw. With 4 points, France ranked third in the group and missed out on the opportunity to advance to the finals in Italy next year.

"I don't think this is Platini's failure," a team member said heavily to reporters after the match. "This is our failure." Platini called on French fans to "care about the future of the French team." The French team will need a few years to catch up. Platini has already proposed reforms for the training of young players. The current issue is whether Platini will continue after his contract expires at the end of this year. He has indicated that this depends not only on the results of the French team's matches but also on whether the players can achieve results in the future.

Starting now, the French team must begin preparations for the 1992 European Cup and the 1994 World Cup. Regardless of his choice, Platini's future life will remain a tense "game."

### 普拉蒂尼说： 生活如同一场比赛

　　普拉蒂尼说：    
    生活如同一场比赛
    本报记者  张启华
    “足球魔术师”普拉蒂尼南征北战、风云足坛多年，成为法国和世界各国球迷的偶像。他在６４９场职业足球比赛中踢进的３５３个球，在人们的头脑中还留有深刻的印象。１９８７年５月１７日，他宣布挂鞋，毅然从进退攻守、激烈争夺的足球比赛场退出，投入了新的生活。他曾说过，“生活就如同一场比赛”，他要“尽可能让自己有新的尝试”，“在自己的家庭和个人要展开的事业之间找到最好的平衡点”。
    普拉蒂尼的生活是丰富多采的，他依照自己的意愿支配时间，他除了关注自己的家庭，子女的教育外，还涉足舆论界，经营体育用品公司，投股多家企业，从事社会福利活动，同时在几个战场上进行新的“比赛”。
    他“一直想了解摄影机背后的世界”，并热衷于他“最感兴趣”的电视广播。他要求同电视一台合作，专访世界名人。根据和电视四台签订的合同，前年１１月，普拉蒂尼到苏黎世为足球赛现场解说。去年１月底，英国利物浦队和阿森纳队激烈争夺战，加上普拉蒂尼绘声绘色地解说，使观众得到极大的满足。终场时，球迷们既为胜利者欢呼，也欢叫普拉蒂尼的名字，以示崇拜之意。
    用普拉蒂尼自己的话来说，他还是一个“商人”。他以多年的积蓄，经营圣—基普里昂、“大体育场”、“普拉蒂尼１０号公司”体育服装联合企业。以他的名字为商标的运动服已在市场上出现。他还亲自走访欧洲大城市，开拓市场，拟将他的商标推向欧洲。
    “普拉蒂尼基金会”是１９８７年初成立的。它是一个公开向吸毒现象宣战，挽救吸毒青少年重返社会的福利机构。两年来，普拉蒂尼运用他的影响，通过教育和上百种职业训练，已有２００多名戒毒的青年重新回到企业，成为一名生产者。基金会制作的广告、唱片、录相带、电影等宣传品受到社会上的好评。普拉蒂尼曾说他“不是佐罗”，但他愿意从物质上和精神上帮助一些青年摆脱毒疵。普拉蒂尼这一高尚的行动，可以看作是他在生活的比赛中“又踢进一个漂亮的球”。
    普拉蒂尼退出足球队之后不过１８个月，于去年１１月又回到烽火连天的足球场担当法国国家队的总教练。人们说，普拉蒂尼受命于危难之时，将充当“救命者”的角色。但在他本人看来，“足球又同地球，也是圆的，没有我普拉蒂尼，法国的足球照样会转动。”他要求人们不要把他当成“法国足球队的保护伞”。鉴于法国队的现状，要打进世界杯赛大门十分困难。许多朋友都劝他不要接受这项任务，普拉蒂尼回答：我知道“除了风险，别无他有”。但“我热爱自己的国家”，“我不能让人说，法国需要你帮忙的时候，你却拒绝”。普拉蒂尼勇敢地接受了任务，并宣布辞去新闻活动，当即招兵买马，点将阅兵，只用了十多天时间，就组建新队上场。
    在世界杯外围赛中，法国队同苏格兰、南斯拉夫、挪威和塞浦路斯分在第五组。前几场结果令人十分失望。法国队赢挪威队一个球，与塞浦路斯踢平，而与苏格兰、南斯拉夫的较量都失利了。４月２９日，在巴黎王子球场，法国队再战南斯拉夫队。这对法国队来说可以说是最后一次机会了。不料，法国队在“密不透风的墙前”，一个球也踢不进。这场球以０∶０战平。法国队积４分，位居小组第三名，终于失去了进军意大利参加明年世界杯决赛的资格。
    “我不认为这是普拉蒂尼的失败，坦率地说，这是我们队员的失败。”赛后一位队员沉重地对记者说道。普拉蒂尼呼吁法国观众都来“关心法国队的未来”。法国队需要用几年的时间才能追赶上来。普拉蒂尼已发表了对青少年队员的训练进行改革的建议。现在的问题是，普拉蒂尼执掌兵符的合同于今年年底期满。普拉蒂尼还能继续干下去吗！他曾经表示，这不仅取决于法国队比赛的结果，更取决于队员们今后是否可能作出成绩来。
    从现在开始，法国队必须着手准备１９９２年的欧洲杯和１９９４年的世界杯赛。不管他做何种选择，普拉蒂尼未来的生活依然是一场紧张的“比赛”。
