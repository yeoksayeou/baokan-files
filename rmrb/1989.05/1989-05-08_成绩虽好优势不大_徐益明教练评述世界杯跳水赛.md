After the sixth World Cup Diving Championship concluded on May 7 in Indianapolis, USA, Xu Yiming, the head coach of the Chinese diving team, was interviewed by a reporter from our newspaper and gave his evaluation of the Chinese diving team's performance.

Coach Xu said that in all nine events, the Chinese team won seven gold medals. This is first and foremost due to the athletes' good performance and their strong fighting spirit. Before the competition, I estimated that we could win four or five gold medals, mainly considering that our preparations were not sufficient this time. After the Seoul Olympics, many athletes gained weight; some athletes like Xiong Ni, Tan Liangde, and Zhang Yuping had not fully recovered from their injuries. From the competition results, each gold medal was won after intense competition. For example, in today's men's 3-meter springboard final, Tan Liangde only secured the victory with a score of over 80 in his last dive. Additionally, the competition between the Soviet Union's Lashko and Gao Min in the women's 3-meter springboard was also very close. He said that this time, Xu Yanmei performed well in the women's platform preliminary round, but her performance in the final was not ideal, causing her to miss the gold medal. The reason is that she had too little preparation time before entering the competition. This coach, who is quite clear-headed, also said: "In this competition, our team was in a situation where we had to catch up in many events, which is very beneficial for improving the athletes' mental toughness; many team members have been competing from morning to evening until 8 PM for several days, which is a great test of their physical condition. This is a good opportunity to train the team."

"Compared to foreign strong teams, we also have many gaps," he said. "The reserve strength of the United States and the Soviet Union is much stronger than ours. According to the American team's head coach, the United States has more than 10,000 people training, while our total number is still less than 1,000, and we have fewer good prospects. Solving the problem of insufficient reserve strength is our urgent task. From a technical perspective, many foreign athletes have good twisting actions, and their takeoff power and height are also worth learning from. Additionally, their physical condition is also better than ours." Xu Yiming expressed that he would learn from the strengths of others to make up for our weaknesses through this competition.

When talking about future plans, Xu Yiming said that to prepare for major international competitions such as the 1990 Beijing Asian Games, the Chinese diving team will continue to leverage the effective "collective advantage" in training. He explained that before the last Olympics, through two training sessions in 1985, talents like Xu Yanmei, Chen Xiaodan, and Xiong Ni were discovered. Then, a national team coach led a few first-line elite athletes to form a training small group. This approach, on the one hand, can directly implement the head coach's intentions in training, and on the other hand, coaches and athletes can get to know each other well in daily life, which is convenient for coaches to provide timely and correct guidance during competitions. It also effectively utilizes limited financial and material resources. The Seoul Olympics proved that this experience was successful. In addition to the first line, Xu Yiming also considered establishing second-line and third-line training groups and using this method as an important part of diving training reform. Coach Xu finally added that good talents are all cultivated by coaches from various provinces and cities through hard work, and without their efforts, there would be no achievements for the national team today.

　　成绩虽好优势不大   
    ——徐益明教练评述世界杯跳水赛
    本报记者  仓立德
    第六届世界杯跳水赛５月７日在美国印第安纳波利斯落下帷幕后，中国队徐益明总教练接受了本报记者采访，并对中国跳水队的表现作了评价。
    徐总教练说，在全部９个项目的比赛中，中国队夺得７块金牌，这首先应归功于运动员发挥好，拚劲足。赛前我估计可拿四五块，主要是考虑到此次出师我们准备不够充分。汉城奥运会后，不少运动员长胖了；有些运动员如熊倪、谭良德、张玉萍等伤病未愈。从比赛结果看，每块金牌都是经过激烈竞争后夺来的。如今天男子３米跳板决赛，谭良德直到最后一跳拿下８０多分才击败对手，另外苏联选手拉什科同高敏在女子３米跳板中的角逐也难解难分。他说，这次许艳梅在女子跳台预赛中跳得好，但决赛发挥不理想，失去金牌，原因是上场前准备时间太短。这位头脑颇为清醒的教练还说：“这次比赛我方在不少项目中是在先落后的情况下追上去的，这对提高选手的心理素质很有益；不少队员几天来上午、下午直到晚上８点连续比赛，这对他们的体质是很大的考验。这是一次锻炼队伍的好机会。”
    “和外国强手相比，我们的差距也不少。”他说，“美国、苏联的跳水后备力量比我们强得多。据美国队总教练讲，美国有１万多人参加训练，而我们总数还不到１０００人，而且好苗子少。解决后备力量不足的问题是我们的当务之急。从技术方面看，不少外国选手转体动作好，起跳的弹力及高度也值得我们学习。另外，他们的体质也比我们强。”徐益明表示，要通过这次比赛做到“以人之长，补己之短”。
    在谈到今后打算时，徐益明表示，为迎接明年北京亚运会等重大国际比赛，中国跳水队将在训练中继续发挥行之有效的“集体优势”。他解释说，上次奥运会前，通过１９８５年的两次集训发现了许艳梅、陈晓丹、熊倪等好苗子，然后由国家队一个教练带几个一线尖子队员组成训练小集体。这样做一来在训练中可直接贯彻总教练的意图，二来平时教练和队员相互熟悉，赛时便于教练给予及时、正确指导，同时也可有效利用有限的财力、物力。汉城奥运会证明这个经验是成功的。除一线外，徐益明还考虑成立二线、三线训练小组，并把这种方法作为跳水训练改革的重要内容。徐总教练最后补充说，好苗子都是各省市教练们辛勤培育出来的，没有他们的艰苦努力便没有国家队今天的成绩。
