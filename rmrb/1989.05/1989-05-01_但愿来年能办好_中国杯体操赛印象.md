The days leading up to May 1st in Beijing, the audience at the Capital Gymnasium was sparse, in stark contrast to the bustling crowds on the streets. The Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships and the China Cup (Samsung) International Gymnastics Competition, held consecutively, had a total audience attendance of less than six sessions. Although China's gymnastics level is already among the world's best, it has also produced star athletes who are very attractive to the audience. However, after the failure at the Olympics last year, the old stars have retired, and people are not yet familiar with the young athletes, doubting their strength and level, so the interest is much less.

The reporter had a conversation with an authority in the gymnastics world at the sidelines. An "old gymnast" said, "The level is so low, if there were more spectators, they would start booing." If the Asian Youth Championships were just a competition among teenagers, it is understandable that the level is not high. However, the China Cup Competition is one of the world's eight major invitational gymnastics events and should not be turned into a low-level performance.

At the Seoul Olympics, the men's all-around medals were all won by Soviet athletes, who have not yet appeared on the international stage this year. East Germany's Tippelt, who won fourth place, was invited to participate in the China Cup Competition and naturally attracted the most attention. However, this person appeared on stage with a tired look, fell from the parallel bars after just the second event, and his all-around score only ranked fifth. Bulgaria's Penev, who once posed a threat to the Chinese team at the Olympics, had a single-item score of only 9.35. Japan's mainstay Yoshiyuki Konishi, who defeated the Chinese team at the Olympics, ranked only 17th in the all-around. The Soviet team sent two pure amateurs. The women's competition was even worse, with a significant gap in levels, the scoreboard often showing scores of 7.XX, 6.XX, and even 5.XX, with the competition level and technical standards not even comparable to domestic gymnastics competitions. There was not a single project or team that did not have a fall, and even the Chinese athletes who won the all-around gold and silver medals all had serious mistakes. Watching such a competition, applause usually only came from the athletes who did not participate, as they had to cheer for their teammates.

China's head coach Gao Jian told the reporter that without an atmosphere, athletes cannot perform to their best. This atmosphere needs to be created by the organizers, the audience, and the athletes together. The young athletes of the Chinese team who participated in the competition have mostly undergone long-term systematic training. Li Jing and Yang Bo have mastered the advanced moves of double backflip with a half twist on the parallel bars and a backflip with a half twist on the balance beam, respectively. Moreover, they will have to bear the heavy responsibility in future major international competitions. Therefore, the China Cup Competition is a good opportunity for them to practice. Unfortunately, their level was also discounted, which is partly due to lack of experience and partly due to lack of competition.

China's gymnastics foundation is still good, and although there is a potential for a major decline, it is not yet at a critical stage that is difficult to overcome. It is necessary to use international competitions to gain experience and accumulate experience, and it also makes the gymnastics world and those who care about gymnastics feel a greater sense of urgency. The China Cup Competition will be included in the series of World Cup qualifying events, and it is not easy to obtain this qualification. Which world power does not want to take advantage of the host country? In short, we should work together to organize the event well, improve the competition quality, and let others know that this China Cup is not easily won.

### 但愿来年能办好——中国杯体操赛印象

　　但愿来年能办好   
    ——中国杯体操赛印象
    本报记者  汪大昭
    “五一”前夕的北京，首都体育馆里的观众稀稀落落，同街头人山人海的情景形成强烈的反差。先后举行的亚洲青年体操锦标赛和中国杯（三星）国际体操赛，六场观众人次总和也填不满看台。本来，中国体操水平已居世界前列，也涌现过对观众很有吸引力的明星选手。但是，去年奥运会上砸锅之后，老将隐退，人们对年轻选手尚不熟悉，信不过他们的实力和水平，兴趣也就差得多了。
    记者在场边同体操界权威人士交谈，一位“老体操”说：“水平这么低，观众多了，还不得嘘起来？”如果说亚青赛都是些半大孩子的较量，水平不高本在意料之中，那么中国杯赛号称世界体操八大邀请赛之一，绝不应该弄成低档次的表演。
    汉城奥运会男子个人全能奖牌均为苏联选手所获，他们今年尚未在国际体坛露过面。民主德国的梯佩尔特拿了第四，这次应邀参加中国杯赛，自然最受人注目。但此人登场后一副倦态，刚做到第二项就从双杠上摔下来，全能积分只排到第五位。奥运会上一度对中国队有所威胁的保加利亚选手彼涅夫，单项最高得分不过９．３５。在奥运会上战胜中国队的日本主将小西裕之全能仅列第１７名。苏联队派来的竟是两个纯属业余水平的小孩。女子比赛情况更糟，水平相差悬殊，计分牌经常显示出７点几、６点几，甚至５点几的低分，竞争程度和技术水准还不如国内体操比赛。没有一个项目，也没有一个队不出现跌落在地的，连包揽全能金、银牌的中国选手也个个都有严重失误。观看这样的比赛，掌声通常只来自那些不上场的运动员，他们毕竟得为队友加加油啊。
    中国队总教练高健对记者说，没有气氛，运动员也发挥不出水平。这个气氛，要主办者、观众和运动员共同创造。中国队上场的年轻选手大多经过长期系统的训练，李敬和杨波分别掌握了双杠两次希里夸尔转体接空翻两周挂臂和平衡木拉拉提空翻３６０°倒插虎等尖端动作，而且，未来的世界大赛非要靠他们担负重任不可。因此，中国杯赛是很好的练兵机会。可惜，他们的水平也打了折扣，其中固然有经验不足的一面，也与不够较劲有关。
    中国体操基础尚可，大滑坡的危险虽然潜在，总还不致一下子就呈现难以克服的危机。利用国际比赛增长见识，积累经验，十分必要，同时，也使体操界和关心体操的人们紧迫感来得更实在。中国杯赛将被列入世界杯外围赛的系列之中，争来这个资格相当不易。世界劲旅哪个不想占有东道主之便呢？总之，应当协力办好赛事，提高比赛质量，让人家知道这座中国杯不是轻而易举就能拿到的。
