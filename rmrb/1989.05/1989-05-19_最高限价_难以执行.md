Title: The Maximum Price Cap is Difficult to Enforce

The State Pricing Bureau, the Ministry of Materials, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation jointly issued a notice starting from April 15 this year, implementing a nationwide unified maximum price cap for non-planned black and nonferrous metals. "Regardless of whether the contracts were signed before or after the price cap, the prices must not exceed the maximum price cap."

However, more than a month has passed, and reporters from several dozen large enterprises and trading units in the Northeast region learned that not a single contract signed before the price cap has been executed at the maximum price. Even contracts signed after the price cap still have many instances where the prices exceed the maximum price cap. Due to the difficulty in enforcing the maximum price cap, the originally scheduled nationwide steel procurement conference on May 20 this year has been indefinitely postponed.

At the largest heavy machinery factory in Asia, the deputy director of the supply department, Liu Xinghan, casually took out a "Supply and Demand Goods Contract." This is a contract signed on May 2 with the supplier, the Northwest Branch of the China Materials Recycling and Utilization Corporation, to purchase 1,300 tons of pig iron at a price of 700 yuan per ton, exceeding the maximum price cap by 120 yuan. The contract clearly states: "The buyer must remit the payment within 20 days after the supplier notifies the remittance; otherwise, the contract will be voided." Liu Xinghan smiled bitterly and said, "Look at this tone, so arrogant! But what can we do? 'Too many monks and too little porridge,' if you don't want it at this price, someone else will, and if you wait too long, the price will go up even more!"

It is reported that the aluminum ingots needed by this factory have a maximum price cap of 13,000 yuan per ton, but the current price has risen to 17,000 yuan. The two types of thin steel plates needed have a maximum price cap of 3,120 yuan and 3,552 yuan per ton, respectively, and the current prices have also risen to over 4,900 yuan. Since this year, just the excess amount paid for purchasing raw materials such as pig iron, aluminum ingots, and steel plates has caused this factory to spend over 10 million yuan more.

The deputy chief economist Chen Buzheng and the supply department director Gao Ping of the Qiqihar Second Machine Tool Factory told reporters that their factory recently purchased a batch of carbon steel with a maximum price cap of 1,635 yuan per ton, but the actual purchase price was 1,700 yuan per ton. Copper has a maximum price cap of 16,060 yuan per ton, but the actual purchase price was 20,000 yuan per ton. Their factory needs 7,500 tons of steel, 12,000 tons of pig iron, 200 tons of copper, and 350 tons of aluminum per year. "If the price cap cannot be enforced, the enterprise will be unable to bear the burden!"

Many local material trading departments have publicly posted price lists exceeding the maximum price cap on the walls. In some places where prices are strictly controlled, the market only has the names and prices of restricted products, but no actual goods. Some production enterprises that are waiting for "rice" to cook only have to go to great lengths to buy raw materials at high prices and keep it a secret for the sellers; otherwise, they will have no "rice" to cook in the future.

It is understood that the main reasons why the "maximum price cap" cannot be enforced are: first, the limited price products are severely in short supply; second, related products such as coal, electricity, water, gas, transportation, coke, and ore have not been price-capped and continue to rise, making it difficult for enterprises producing limited price products to absorb the costs, forcing them to raise prices to offset the increases; third, speculators are still active. Some economic workers have stated that if comprehensive measures are not taken, the "maximum price cap" will only be a piece of paper.

### “最高限价”难以执行

　　“最高限价”难以执行
    新华社记者  新彦  高欣  金虎
    国家物价局、物资部、冶金工业部、中国有色金属工业总公司联合发出通知，从今年４月１５日起对计划外黑色、有色金属执行全国统一最高限价，“不论限价前还是限价后签订的合同，价格均不得超过最高限价”。
    然而，一个多月过去了，记者从东北地区的数１０家大企业和经销单位了解到，不但限价前签订的合同没有一个执行最高限价，就是限价后签订的合同，也仍然有许多价格超过最高限价。由于最高限价难以执行，原定每年５月２０日举行的全国钢材订货会议，今年被无限期地延迟了。
    在亚洲最大的第一重型机器厂，供应处副处长刘兴汉随手拿出一份《供需货物合同书》。这是５月２日与供货单位中国物资再生利用总公司西北分公司签订的购买１３００吨生铁的合同，每吨价格７００元，超出最高限价１２０元。合同书上还赫然注明：“需方必须在供方通知汇款后２０日内将款汇足“否则合同作废”。刘兴汉苦笑着说：“瞧这口气，多横！可有什么办法呢，‘僧多粥少’，要不要就这个价，你不要自有人要，要晚了还得涨哩！”
    据介绍，这家工厂所需要的铝锭，最高限价每吨为１３０００元，现已涨到１７０００元；所需要的两种薄钢板，最高限价每吨分别为３１２０元和３５５２元，目前也都已涨到４９００元以上。今年以来，仅购买生铁、铝锭、钢板等原材料超过最高限价的部分，就使这家工厂多支出１０００多万元。
    齐齐哈尔第二机床厂的副总经济师陈步争和供应科长高平告诉记者，他们厂刚刚买进的一批碳钢，最高限价每吨为１６３５元，实际进价１７００元；铜每吨最高限价为１６０６０元，实际进价为２００００元。他们厂全年需要钢材７５００吨、生铁１２０００吨、铜２００吨、铝３５０吨，“如果限价限不住，企业将不堪重负！”
    许多地方的物资经销部门，把超过最高限价的价目张榜公布在墙上。在一些物价管得紧的地方，市场上光有被限制产品的名称和价目，却没有货。一些等“米”下锅的生产企业，只好千方百计地去花高价买原材料，还得替卖主保密，否则他们以后就无“米”下锅。
    据了解，“最高限价”限不住的主要原因，一是限价产品严重短缺；二是与限价产品有关的煤、电、水、汽、运、焦炭、矿石等没有限价，继续看涨，生产限价产品的企业难以消化，只好以涨消涨；三是倒爷仍在作祟。一些经济工作者断言，如不采取综合措施，“最高限价”只能是一纸空文。
