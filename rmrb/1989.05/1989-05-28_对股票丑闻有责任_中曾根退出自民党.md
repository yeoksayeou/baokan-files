People's Daily, Tokyo, May 28th.

Former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro today announced his resignation from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). He cited his responsibility for the Recruit stock scandal that occurred during his tenure.

Nakasone's decision to take responsibility is linked to the selection of the new LDP president. Recently, there has been growing demand within the LDP for those implicated in the stock scandal to take responsibility before the new president is chosen. The preliminary candidate for the new president, Uno Sōsuke, belongs to Nakasone's faction within the LDP. Nakasone realized that without taking some form of responsibility, public outrage would not be appeased, and the selection of the new president might be hindered.

After Nakasone's announcement, some within the party felt that Nakasone had chosen the lightest form of atonement. The opposition parties, however, believed Nakasone's actions were insufficient and demanded that the House of Councillors continue to question him.

This afternoon, when asked if he had similar plans, Prime Minister Takeshita responded that he was currently busy mediating the selection of the new president and had not considered the matter.

　　对股票丑闻有责任
    中曾根退出自民党
    本报东京５月２８日电  记者于青报道：日本前首相中曾根康弘今天宣布退出自民党。理由是，在他执政期间发生了利库路特股票丑闻，他对此负有责任。
    中曾根做出承担责任的表示，是与自民党新总裁人选相联系的。近来，自民党内要求牵连股票丑闻的人物，在新总裁就任之前做出承担责任的表示的呼声日益强烈。昨天初步确定的新总裁人选宇野宗佑，属于自民党中曾根派。中曾根意识到，自己若无所表示，难平民愤，新总裁选定也可能受阻。
    中曾根宣布退党后，党内有人认为，中曾根选择的是最轻的一种反省方式。在野党认为，中曾根的表示并不充分，要求参院继续传问中曾根。
    今天下午，竹下首相被记者问到，是否也有与中曾根同样的打算时，竹下说，现在正忙于斡旋新总裁，还没有考虑这个问题。
