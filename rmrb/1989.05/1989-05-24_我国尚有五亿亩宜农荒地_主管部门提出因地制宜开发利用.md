	China still has 500 million mu of cultivable wasteland. The relevant authorities have proposed developing and utilizing it according to local conditions.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, May 24th – The State Land Administration Bureau, based on the status of land resources, proposes that in the coming years, several million mu of farmland can be developed annually nationwide to supplement the farmland occupied by construction. As long as all localities strictly implement the policy of saving farmland and insist on linking land occupation with land development, the total area of farmland nationwide can be stabilized within two to three years, and the area of cultivated land can be basically stabilized.

	The data provided by the bureau indicates that China still has 500 million mu of large tracts of cultivable wasteland, from which more than 100 million mu of farmland can be reclaimed; there are more than 30 million mu of land damaged by industrial and mining construction, a considerable portion of which can be developed into farmland or other agricultural land. In addition, there are nearly 100 million mu of scattered and idle wasteland available for development and utilization nationwide.

	It is understood that due to the continuous reduction of cultivated land and the increasing population, various levels of government have realized that the reduction of cultivated land not only shakes the foundation of agriculture but also becomes an obstacle to the development of the national economy.

	Based on past experiences and lessons, the State Land Administration Bureau warns that in the future land development work, the following points should be noted:

	1. While "increasing the source" (developing new farmland), "saving the flow" (saving farmland) should not be neglected;

	2. Adhere to the principle of suitability and avoid a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Local governments should, based on the status of land resources to be developed and the amount of land occupied by construction in different regions, formulate land development and utilization plans under the premise of not damaging the ecological balance;

	3. Organize and plan the development in a systematic manner. Local governments should take the lead in this work and implement a division of responsibilities among relevant departments;

	4. Encourage multi-departmental and multi-form participation in development. Many places have adopted the contracting method, stipulating that any unit or individual with development capabilities can participate in bidding and contracting. This method has mobilized the enthusiasm of developers and should be continued;

	5. Adhere to the principle that land-requiring units bear the development responsibility. Land management departments should give consideration to units that undertake development tasks when they acquire land;

	6. Pay attention to the combination of developing scattered and idle wasteland with large-scale reclamation;

	7. Pay attention to the utilization of land after development, and strictly prohibit the phenomena of not utilizing land after development or developing and then abandoning it.

### 我国尚有五亿亩宜农荒地  主管部门提出因地制宜开发利用

　　我国尚有五亿亩宜农荒地
    主管部门提出因地制宜开发利用
    新华社北京５月２４日电  国家土地管理局根据土地资源状况提出，今后若干年内全国每年可以开发出几百万亩农用地，以补充被建设占用的农用地，而且只要各地严格执行节约耕地制度并坚持建设占用土地与开发土地紧密挂钩，在两三年内全国农用地面积就有可能稳定下来，进而实现耕地面积基本稳定。
    这个局提供的资料说，我国尚有５亿亩大片宜农荒地，可开垦出１亿多亩的耕地；有３０００多万亩工矿生产建设破坏的土地，其中相当一部分可开发成耕地或其他农用地。此外，全国还有近１亿亩的零星闲散荒地可供开发利用。
    据了解，由于耕地连年下降，人口逐年增加，各级政府已意识到耕地减少不仅动摇了农业基础，而且成为国民经济发展的障碍。
    根据以往的经验教训，国家土地管理局告诫，各地在今后的土地开发工作中需注意以下几点：
    一是在“开源”（开发新耕地）的同时，决不放松“节流”（节约耕地）；
    二是坚持因地制宜，不搞“一刀切”。各级政府应当根据不同地区待开发土地资源状况和建设占用耕地多少，在保证不破坏生态平衡的前提下，编制土地开发利用计划；
    三是要有组织有计划地进行开发。对此项工作各级政府应统一领导，实行各有关部门分工负责制；
    四是提倡多部门参与、多形式的开发。许多地方已采取承包方式，规定凡有开发能力的单位和个人均可参与投标承包，这种办法调动了开发者的积极性，应当坚持；
    五是坚持征地单位承担开发义务的原则，土地管理部门对承担开发任务的单位，在征地时予以照顾；
    六是注意零星闲散荒地开发与大面积开荒相结合；
    七是要注意开发后土地的利用，严格制止开发后不利用或边开边荒的现象。
