Qian Qichen, the Foreign Minister, stated today that China holds a "positive attitude" towards Australian Prime Minister Robert Hawke's proposal to convene an inter-governmental ministerial-level meeting in the Asia-Pacific region.

He pointed out that only sovereign states' governments can send government ministers to attend this meeting, which aims to enhance economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.

Qian Qichen made these remarks during a meeting with Richard Woolcott, the special envoy of the Australian Prime Minister.

Woolcott arrived in Beijing yesterday to brief the Chinese government on the purpose of the meeting proposed by Hawke and the consultations Australia has had with Japan, ASEAN countries, and others. The meeting is tentatively scheduled to be held in Australia in November of this year.

Qian Qichen told Woolcott that China has always held a positive attitude towards any proposals and suggestions that are conducive to strengthening economic cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region, as long as they are practical. China appreciates Australia's efforts over the years to strengthen economic cooperation in the region.

Qian Qichen emphasized that the convening of the meeting should be based on the actual situation in the region and should be coordinated with existing regional economic cooperation organizations, allowing them to play their due roles.

He said that to ensure the success of the meeting, relevant parties need to further consult on issues such as the purpose and scope of the participating countries. He stated: "If the relevant parties can reach a consensus through consultation, China will have no problem participating in the meeting."

At Woolcott's request, Qian Qichen also briefed him on the recent high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union.

　　钱其琛会见澳大利亚总理特使
    新华社北京５月１９日电（记者周慈朴）钱其琛外长今天在这里说，中国对澳大利亚总理罗伯特·霍克建议召开亚太地区政府间部长级会议持“积极态度”。
    他指出，只有主权国家的政府才能派政府部长出席这一旨在加强亚太地区经济合作的会议。
    钱其琛是在会见澳大利亚总理特使理查德·伍尔科特时说这番话的。
    伍尔科特昨天抵达北京，向中国政府通报霍克总理建议召开的会议的目的以及澳大利亚跟日本、东盟国家等磋商的情况。会议初步定于今年１１月在澳大利亚召开。
    钱其琛对伍尔科特说，对于一切有利于加强亚太地区经济合作的主张和建议，凡是切实可行的，中国一贯持积极态度。中国赞赏澳大利亚多年来为了加强本地区经济合作所作的努力。
    钱其琛指出，召开会议必须从本地区的实际情况出发，跟现有的区域性经济合作机构协调好，让它们发挥应起的作用。
    他说，为了使会议取得成功，有关方面需要就会议的目的、参加国的范围等问题进一步磋商。他说：“如果有关各方能够达到协商一致的意见，中国参加会议是没有问题的”。
    应伍尔科特的要求，钱其琛还介绍了不久前举行的中苏高级会晤的情况。
