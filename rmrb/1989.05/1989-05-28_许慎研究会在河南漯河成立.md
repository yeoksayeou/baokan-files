The first academic society in China dedicated to the study of Xushen, the Xushen Research Society, was recently established in Luoyang, Henan Province, the hometown of Xushen. This society is composed of over 60 experts and scholars from 21 colleges and universities, as well as various research institutions across the country. Xushen was a renowned scholar of ancient texts and a philologist during the Han Dynasty. His magnum opus, "Shuowen Jiezi," is the first systematic work in Chinese history that analyzes the shapes of characters and explores their origins. This book has had a profound influence on subsequent generations, and scholars have achieved rich results in the study of Xushen. Today, many foreign Sinologists consider the study of "Shuowen Jiezi" a key to understanding Chinese culture, and Xushen studies have become a global academic discipline.

　　许慎研究会在河南漯河成立
    本报讯  我国第一个专门研究许学的群众性学术团体——许慎研究会，最近在许慎故里河南省漯河市宣告成立。这个研究会由全国２１所高、中等院校和一些研究机构的６０多位专家、学者组成。许慎是我国汉代著名的古文经学家和文字学家，所著《说文解字》一书是我国历史上第一部系统地分析字形和考究字源的专著，对后世影响极大，历代学者在许学研究中取得了丰厚的成果。现在，国外不少汉学家都把研究《说文解字》作为学习中国文化的管龠，许学已经成为一门世界性的学问。
