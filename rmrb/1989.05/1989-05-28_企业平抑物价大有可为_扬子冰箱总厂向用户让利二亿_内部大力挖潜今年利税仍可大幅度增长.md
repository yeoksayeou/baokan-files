	Recently elevated to the status of a national large-scale enterprise, the Yangzi Refrigerator Factory has taken a crucial step in stabilizing market prices. It has decided to reduce the price of each refrigerator by 25%, amounting to a total benefit of over 200 million yuan for consumers this year.

	The Yangzi refrigerator features a large freezing compartment, innovative and elegant design, low energy consumption, and two patented auxiliary functions: "external cold beverage retrieval" and "sealed hanging compartment." With its superior quality, the refrigerator quickly became a popular item upon its market release in the second half of last year and swiftly gained a foothold in the international market. Last year, the factory achieved a production value of 1.87 billion yuan, tax revenue of 62.5 million yuan, and a per capita labor productivity of 110,000 yuan. These three indicators ranked first in the national machinery industry. The production line imported from Italy, which is at the advanced level of the 1980s, currently has an annual production capacity of 500,000 units and has been approved by the State Council as an export base enterprise.

	The significant price reduction by the Yangzi Refrigerator Factory is based on optimized design and strengthened management, aiming to reduce consumption and increase production volume. This year, the factory plans to produce 300,000 units, a threefold increase from last year. The factory's general manager and national outstanding entrepreneur, Xuan Zhongguang, told reporters: "An enterprise cannot survive without profits. Although this price reduction amounts to over 200 million yuan, internal potential has been fully tapped, and with thin profits and high sales volume, this year's tax revenue can still see a significant increase compared to last year, with foreign exchange earnings reaching over 10 million US dollars." Before the price reduction was implemented, the factory further optimized the design of the refrigerators, reducing costs and enhancing stability and reliability. The power consumption of a 200-liter refrigerator has been reduced to approximately 0.8 degrees per day, reaching the highest level among domestic similar products. To ensure quality, the factory strictly inspects raw materials and components from the outset. Key parts, personnel, equipment, instruments, production conditions, and manufacturing processes all have quality control points, and each refrigerator has its own file. At the same time, they have strengthened after-sales service, strictly implementing the "three guarantees" policy. They have now established 187 service points, with maintenance centers in each province, thereby increasing consumer trust in Yangzi refrigerators.

	After the significant price reduction, the factory maintains its spirit by appropriately addressing the unsold inventory of commercial departments through flexible methods. They also sign contracts with sales departments, publicly disclosing factory prices to the public, preventing "speculators" from profiting in the circulation sector, and ensuring genuine benefits for the people.

　　企业平抑物价大有可为
    扬子冰箱总厂向用户让利二亿
    内部大力挖潜今年利税仍可大幅度增长
    本报讯  最近升为国家大型企业的扬子冰箱总厂，为平抑市场物价走出关键的一步，日前决定将每台冰箱售价下降２５％，今年给消费者总让利可达２亿多元。
    扬子冰箱冷冻室容量大，款式新颖高雅，耗电少，更有“外取冷饮，密封挂盒”两个专利为辅助功能，质量好，去年下半年一投放市场便成为抢手货，并迅速在国际市场打开销路。去年这个厂产值１．８７亿元，利税６２５０万元，人均劳动生产率１１万元，三项指标均居全国机械行业之首。从意大利引进的具有８０年代先进水平的生产线，目前已形成年产５０万台的能力，被国务院批准为出口基地企业。
    扬子冰箱总厂的巨额让利，是以优化设计、强化管理为前提，以降低消耗、增大批量为后盾的。今年计划生产３０万台，比去年增加３倍。该厂总经理、全国优秀企业家宣中光对记者说：企业不赚钱是要垮台的。这次尽管让利二亿多元，但内部挖潜工作做得好，薄利多销，今年税利仍可比去年有较大幅度增长，创汇可达１０００多万美元。在这次让利出台之前，这个厂对冰箱进一步优化设计，成本有所下降，性能更加稳定可靠，２００升冰箱耗电量下降至每天０．８度左右，达到国内同类产品的最高水平。为确保质量，他们从原材料、零部件开始就严格检测，对关键部位从人员、设备、仪器到生产条件、制作工艺，都有质量控制点，每台冰箱都建有档案。与此同时，他们加强售后服务，严格执行“三包”政策，现在已建立了１８７个服务网点，各省都有维修中心，从而使用户对扬子冰箱增加了信任感。
    扬子冰箱大幅度的降价后，工厂发扬风格，对于商业部门尚未售出的货，用变通办法给予妥善解决。他们还同销售部门签订合同，向群众公开出厂价格，防止“倒爷”在流通领域渔利，保证做到真正让利于民。
