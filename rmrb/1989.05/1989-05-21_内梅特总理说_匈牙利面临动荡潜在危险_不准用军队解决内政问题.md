Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 20th.

Hungarian Prime Minister Nemeth stated on May 19th that Hungary faces potential risks of turmoil, particularly around the June 16th reburial of Nagy and the October 23rd anniversary of the Hungarian events.

Nemeth made these remarks at a meeting with senior leaders of the Hungarian People's Army on May 19th. His speech was published by local media on May 20th.

Nemeth said, "I believe that no political force should be allowed to use the military to solve internal political issues." He continued, "One of the most detestable features of the Stalinist model is the arbitrary use of armed forces to suppress one's own people. We must resolutely break with this past practice. The consequences of such actions are that, to this day, there remains a latent fear and suspicion of the armed forces among the public and in people's minds."

During Hungary's transition to political pluralism, many people are concerned about the military interfering with and obstructing the political process. Observers here believe that Nemeth's remarks are directed at addressing these concerns.

　　内梅特总理说
    匈牙利面临动荡潜在危险
    不准用军队解决内政问题
    新华社布达佩斯５月２０日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党政治局委员、政府总理内梅特１９日指出，在今年６月１６日重新安葬纳吉和１０月２３日匈牙利事件周年之际，匈牙利面临着发生动荡局面的潜在危险。
    内梅特是在１９日匈牙利人民军高级将领会议上说这番话的。此间新闻媒介２０日发表了他的讲话。
    内梅特说，“我认为，应该不准许任何政治力量利用军队来解决内政问题”，“斯大林模式的一个最可恨的特点就是肆意动用武装力量整治本国人民。我们应该最坚决地同过去的这种做法决裂。过去的做法造成的后果是，至今在公众当中和在人们心理上还存在着一种潜流，那就是对武装力量惧怕和怀疑。”
    在匈牙利实行政治多元化的过程中，社会上许多人担心军队干预和阻挠政治进程的发展。此间观察家认为，内梅特的讲话就是针对这种顾虑而言的。
