In Singapore, smoking is only allowed in designated smoking areas. If caught smoking outside these areas, individuals face a fine of 500 Singapore dollars (approximately 900 Chinese yuan) for the first offense, with the fine doubling for subsequent offenses. Smoking areas are typically large, enclosed spaces resembling auditoriums, filled with seating and ashtrays. Entry is through a small door, with windows that cannot be opened. The ceiling is equipped with a chimney, and the air inside is thick with smoke, making it quite unpleasant. Smoking at home is also prohibited. If neighbors see or smell cigarette smoke, they can report it, leading to a fine of 500 Singapore dollars for the first offense and 1,000 for the second.

In Singapore, fines for smoking are not collected on the spot. Instead, the offender's identification number is recorded and entered into a computer system. The individual must then pay the fine at a designated location within 24 hours; failure to do so results in the fine doubling. If the fine remains unpaid after three days, a court summons is issued, and the penalty can escalate significantly.

　　吸烟执法在新加坡
    在新加坡抽烟，必须到吸烟区去抽，否则，一次罚款５００元（相当人民币９００多元），第二次加倍。吸烟区是一座像礼堂样的房子，里面摆满了坐椅和烟缸。一个小门进去，四周的玻璃窗不能打开，屋顶安了一个烟囱，里面烟雾腾腾，简直是活受罪。你若在家里抽也不行。邻居看见或闻到烟味，一个电话打出去，管委会立刻来人，也是一次罚款５００，第二次１０００。
    新加坡的吸烟罚款，罚时并不是当面交钱，而是记下你的身份证号码，输入电脑，要你自己到罚款处交钱，２４小时内不交，加倍；第三天不交，法院便传讯，那就不知会罚多少了！
