Title: The Forgotten Monument

I stumbled upon that monument by chance.

One afternoon in Chongqing, I was wandering in the People's Park. Though not large, the park is lush with trees, and everywhere people are practicing martial arts, playing chess, gambling, or "holding court." I was about to leave the park through the highest exit when I glanced back and saw a stone tablet peeking out from a grove of trees. I have a habit of admiring tablets, so I immediately turned back and headed towards the tablet.

The tablet's design is not particularly beautiful, nor is it elaborately decorated. It is made of concrete and is clearly quite new. People coming and going pass by it without stopping to admire it, and hardly anyone even glances at it.

The weathered inscription on the tablet tells me that although its appearance is unremarkable, it is different from other tablets and has significant commemorative value.

Most of the inscription has been damaged, even the characters at the top have not escaped harm. This is clearly not natural wear and tear, but deliberate destruction. An elderly man with a pure Sichuan accent told me that it was smashed during the Red Guard era. They intended to push the entire tablet over, but after struggling for a long time, they failed, so they brought a ladder and smashed every character on the tablet from top to bottom!

Fortunately, most of the inscription can still be discerned. I read it character by character, like a student learning to read, and found out that the tablet was erected in 1947, initiated by the then Chongqing Municipal Council, Chamber of Commerce, General Federation of Trade Unions, Bankers' Association, Women's Association, and Educational Association. The front of the tablet is inscribed with the thirteen large regular script characters "Chongqing City Firefighters Martyrs Memorial Tablet," and below it, on the horizontal stone, is the inscription, which reads: "(Chongqing) is densely populated, and whether day or night, in heat or cold, once a fire alarm is raised, it is feared that it will spread like wildfire.

"After the July 7th Incident, the Japanese invaders rampaged, bombing frequently, and the entire city suffered 96 air raids, resulting in 296 fire scenes. At that time, the firefighters, with their spirit of service, bravely risked their lives, day and night, to rescue people, and either were killed by bombs or injured and died in collapsed buildings. A total of 81 firefighters died, just like the soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield! Their merits are great, and they are inscribed on this stone to be remembered forever."

On the right side of the tablet base, under the title "List of Names of Martyrs Who Died in the War of Resistance," the names of 81 people are inscribed.

From ancient times to the present, no one with a normal mind is not afraid of fires, and people have always admired those who bravely fight fires. The inscription on the "Firefighters Martyrs Memorial Tablet" makes it clear that these 81 firefighters, in any era and any country, should be considered heroes and martyrs. The tablet is a monument to the martyrs who saved people from fire.

It is understandable that such a tablet was destroyed during the Cultural Revolution, but what is puzzling is that after 23 years since the "Four Olds" campaign and more than ten years since the Gang of Four fell, and after many years of implementing policies, I believe that the Chongqing City Firefighters Martyrs Memorial Tablet, which was smashed, is a challenge by evil to justice. It should now be restored to its original appearance and a new inscription added to remind future generations of history.

That afternoon, I lingered by the tablet for a long time, seeing batch after batch of people pass by the tablet indifferently; when I copied the inscription and took photos, I even attracted some curious glances...

### 冷落的纪念碑

　　冷落的纪念碑
    王化君
    我是偶然看到那座纪念碑的。
    在重庆，一天下午，我徜徉在市人民公园。公园虽不大，但树木甚茂，到处都是练功、下棋、打牌和“摆龙门阵”的人们。我正想从最高处的出口离开人民公园时，回首往下一望，发现在一片树丛中，露出一块石碑来。我有观碑的嗜好，立即折下，向石碑所在方向走去。
    碑的造型说不上美，亦无多少雕饰，是混凝土结构，年代肯定很晚。来来往往的人们，从它近旁经过时，不仅无人驻足观赏，连较注意地看它一眼的人都很少。
    斑驳难辨的碑文告诉我，此碑貌虽不扬，却与众碑不同，很有纪念意义。
    碑文几乎都被毁坏过，连最高处的字也未能幸免于难。这显然不是自然损坏，而是有人存心所为。一位川音纯正的老者告诉我，那是闹红卫兵时砸的。本想把整座碑推倒，但折腾了半天未能如愿，便找来梯子，把纪念碑上上下下的字全都砸了一通！
    幸好，大部分碑文仍能辨出。我如小学生认字般地一字一字地辨下去，知道此碑建于一九四七年，由当时的重庆市参议会、商会、总工会、银行公会、妇女会、教育会等发起建造。碑身正面刻的是“建重庆市消防人员殉职纪念碑”十三个盈尺楷体大字，其下横石上刻着碑记，其中曰：（重庆）“人烟稠密，无论昼夜寒暑，一遇火警，辄患燎原。
    “七七事变后，□□□（□号为无法辨认之字）倭寇肆虐，轰炸频仍，全市计遭空袭九十六次，火场达二百九十六处。当时消防人员本服务精神，奋不顾身，不□宵旰，竭力抢救，或被弹炸死，或塌房伤亡，罹难长员计八十一员，与前方抗战□士壮烈牺牲者无或稍殊！其功甚伟，勒诸于石，以志不朽。”
    碑座右侧面“抗战殉职人员姓名列左”的标题后，刻着八十一人的名字。
    古往今来，凡神经正常之人没有不怕火灾的，对勇于救火之人，人们历来都是敬佩不已的。“消防人员殉职纪念碑”碑文说得再清楚不过了，八十一位消防人员，在任何时期，任何国家都应是英雄和烈士，纪念碑就是一座救民于火的烈士的纪念碑。
    对这样的一座纪念碑，在文革时期受毁，其原因不言自明，可令人不解的是，破“四旧”已过去二十三个年头了，“四人帮”垮台也已十多年了，落实政策也搞了许多年，窃以为重庆市消防人员殉职纪念碑的被砸，是邪恶向公理的挑战，如今也应恢复其原貌，并附重修碑记，以证后人永记历史。
    那天下午，我在纪念碑前盘桓良久，看到一批批人漠然从纪念碑旁走过；我抄录碑文和拍照时，还引来一些像是看怪事的眼光……
