Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 17th.

The Polish Parliament held a meeting on May 17th to review and pass the law on relations between church and state, the law on guaranteeing freedom of belief, and the law on social security for clergy.

The vast majority of Polish residents are religious. Various churches, particularly the Catholic Church, have significant influence in Polish society.

Barcikowski, a member of the Polish United Workers' Party's Political Bureau, spoke at the parliamentary meeting. He summarized the characteristics of the three decrees as follows: First, adherence to the principles of "freedom of belief" and "separation of church and state," with the government fully guaranteeing the freedom and rights of churches as stipulated by the constitution, but not allowing churches to directly participate in political movements or struggles under the guise of "religious freedom"; second, emphasizing that consultation and dialogue are the most basic methods for resolving conflicts between the government and the church; third, expanding the rights of the church, such as the church's right to publish newspapers and establish publishing houses, theaters, film studios, and even the right to establish news agencies, radio stations, and television stations.

The deputies expressed their agreement during the review of the three draft laws, believing that it is "appropriate" to fix religious policies and church-state relations in legal form. This is beneficial for social supervision and national stability.

The representatives of the Polish Catholic Church expressed their joy at the parliament's passage of the three laws and assured that the church would abide by these laws and serve Polish society.

　　波兰议会通过政教关系法    
    主张政教分离保障信仰自由
    新华社华沙５月１７日电（记者汤德乔）波兰议会１７日举行会议，审议并通过了政教关系法、保障信仰自由法和神职人员社会保障法。
    波兰绝大多数居民信奉宗教。各种教会特别是天主教会在波兰社会上拥有颇大的影响。
    波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员巴尔齐科夫斯基在议会会议上发言。他把３个法令的特点归纳为：第一，坚持“信仰自由”和“政教分离”原则，政府充分保障教会享有宪法规定的自由和权利，但不允许教会在“宗教自由”的幌子下直接参与政治运动或政治斗争；第二，强调协商、对话是解决政府和教会矛盾的最基本方法；第三，扩大教会的权利，例如教会有权办报纸和出版社、开设戏院、创办电影制片厂，甚至有权建立通讯社、电台和电视台。
    议员们在审议这３个法令草案时都表示赞同，认为用法律形式把宗教政策和政教关系固定下来是“可取的”，它有利于社会的监督和国家的稳定。
    波兰天主教教会代表对议会通过上述３项法律表示高兴，并保证教会将遵守这些法律，为波兰社会服务。
