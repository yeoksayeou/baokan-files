The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China submitted a report to the Party Central Committee today on the situation of studying and discussing the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun.

The report said that in recent days, the standing committee members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and all staff of the commission repeatedly listened to, watched, and studied the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, government, and military cadres' meeting. They also held meetings at the bureau level and for all Party members and cadres to convey Li Ximing's introduction on the situation of the Beijing student movement. Everyone agreed that the speeches by the central leaders were very important. The decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council will play a significant role in unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the nation, stopping the turmoil, restoring normal order in the capital, and maintaining the political situation of national stability and unity. Everyone expressed their agreement and support.

Everyone said: The speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun represent the wishes of the entire Party and the nation; the central decision to impose martial law in some parts of the capital reflects the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people. The turmoil created by a small number of people exploiting the patriotic enthusiasm of young students must be stopped. Otherwise, there will be no peace in the country, the people will suffer, reform and construction will be difficult, and a China with a bright future and hope will become a China without a future and hope.

To thoroughly implement the spirit of the Beijing Party, government, and military cadres' meeting, the standing committee members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection further required the discipline inspection cadres to:

(1) Continue to deeply study the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, unify thoughts, unify understanding, understand the situation, firm up confidence, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, and contribute to stopping the turmoil and maintaining the overall situation of stability and unity.

(2) All Party members and cadres should prioritize the overall situation, believe in the Party's leadership, and firmly act according to the spirit of the central decisions. Do not listen to rumors, do not spread small talk, do not do anything harmful to stability and unity, and maintain consistency in actions with the central authorities.

(3) Strictly observe organizational discipline, abide by Party and state laws, not only refrain from participating in parades and support activities but also actively do a good job in educating family members, children, and surrounding masses to jointly maintain the overall situation of stability and unity and uphold the authority of the Party and the government.

(4) Stay at their posts, do their jobs well, and continue to handle cases of Party members' violations of discipline, contributing to the seriousness of Party discipline and the punishment of corrupt behavior.

    新华社北京５月２６日电  今天，中共中央纪委就学习讨论李鹏、杨尚昆同志讲话的情况向党中央写了一份汇报材料。
    中央纪委的汇报说，连日来，中央纪委常委和机关全体职工反复收听、收看和学习讨论李鹏、杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话，并先后召开机关司局级干部大会和全体党员干部大会，传达李锡铭同志在首都党政军干部大会上关于北京市学潮的发生和发展情况的介绍。大家认为，中央领导同志的讲话非常重要，党中央、国务院作出的决策，对于统一全党、全国人民的思想，制止动乱，恢复首都的正常秩序，维护全国安定团结的政治局面将起重大作用，大家表示赞同和拥护。
    大家表示：李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的讲话代表了全党、全国人民的心愿；中央关于在首都部分地区实行戒严的决策，体现了广大人民群众的根本利益。极少数人利用青年学生的爱国热情制造的动乱，必须予以制止。否则，国无宁日，人民遭殃，改革和建设难以进行，一个很有前途和希望的中国就会变成一个没有前途没有希望的中国。
    为了认真贯彻首都党政军干部大会精神，中央纪委常委进一步要求纪检干部：
    （一）继续深入学习李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的讲话，统一思想，统一认识，认清形势，坚定信心，紧密团结在党中央周围，为制止动乱、维护安定团结大局作出贡献。

    （三）严格组织纪律，遵守党纪国法，不仅自己不参与游行和声援活动，而且积极做好家属子女和周围群众的工作，为共同维护安定团结大局、维护党和政府的权威而努力。
    （四）坚守岗位，做好本职工作，继续抓好党员违纪案件的查处工作，为严肃党纪，惩治腐败行为，作出新的贡献。
