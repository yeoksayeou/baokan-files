	△Recently, Professor Wang Shaohua, an archaeologist from the Nanjing Museum, conducted an on-site appraisal of the ancient relics at Wulonggang in Guoyun County, Jiangsu Province, and confirmed that the locally known "Star Stone," "Star Observation Stone," and "Sun and Moon Stone" are star observation stones from the Shang Dynasty, dating back over 3,000 years.

		The star observation stones at Wulonggang are spread across 200 large and small, orderly circular depressions. The largest has a diameter of 22 centimeters and a depth of 6 centimeters, while the smallest has a diameter of 3 centimeters and a depth of 2 centimeters. This discovery has significant academic value for the study of ancient astronomy, meteorology, folklore, and agricultural production in China's coastal regions.
