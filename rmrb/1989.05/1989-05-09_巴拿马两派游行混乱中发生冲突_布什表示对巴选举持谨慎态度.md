Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, May 8th.

The two main factions in Panama's elections both claimed victory, leading to clashes.

According to a live report from Mexico's television station, the presidential candidate of the opposition Democratic Alliance, Guillermo Endara, announced that his alliance had won over 70% of the votes in the May 7th election. Endara's supporters held a large demonstration this afternoon, but were stopped by military police and clashed with the official-supported National Liberation Alliance. In the chaos, shots were fired, injuring several people. The military police arrested more than a dozen individuals.

So far, the official results of the vote count have not been released. In the "San Miguelito" district, where a quarter of Panama City's population resides, there was a reported incident of ballot boxes being seized. This district has 200,000 residents, making up one-fourth of the capital's population.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 8th.

President Bush held a meeting at the White House today with senior government officials to discuss the still-undetermined results of the Panama election and potential outcomes, with specific actions to be decided after receiving a report from the U.S. observer delegation on May 9th.

Several observers who had just returned from Panama (Congress members) unanimously agreed that General Noriega had engaged in "fraud" in the election.

According to an analysis by the three major U.S. television networks, if Noriega "steals" the election results, the Bush administration faces several possible choices: direct use of force, abrogation of the 1979 U.S.-Panama Treaty on the Panama Canal, strengthening economic sanctions, and sending more troops to the U.S. military base in the Panama Canal Zone. They also estimated that the U.S. government might choose the latter option. However, President Bush told a CBS reporter at the White House today that he would adopt a "cautious" attitude.

	5月8日，巴拿马首都大约2万名支持公民反对派民主联盟的选民举行示威，抗议政府支持民族解放联盟宣布在大选中获胜。在5月7日巴拿马大选投票结束不久，官方和反对派都宣布各自的候选人获胜。

　　巴拿马两派游行混乱中发生冲突   
    布什表示对巴选举持谨慎态度
    本报墨西哥城５月８日电  记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马大选中主要两派均称自己在选举中获胜，并发生了冲突。
    据墨西哥电视台从现场报道，巴拿马反对派公民反对派民主联盟总统候选人恩达拉宣布，该联盟在７日大选中获得７０％以上的选票。恩达拉的支持者今天下午在进行盛大示威游行时，被军警阻拦，并与官方支持的民族解放联盟发生冲突。混乱中有人使用武器射击，打伤数人。军警逮捕了十余人。
    据报道，迄今为止，官方没有公布任何关于选票计数的结果。在巴拿马城居民最集中的“圣米格里托”选区发生了选票被劫的事件。该选区有２０万居民，占首都巴拿马城人口的１／４。
    本报华盛顿５月８日电　记者张亮报道：布什总统今天在白宫召集政府有关高级官员会议，就尚未揭晓的巴拿马选举及可能出现的结局商讨对策，其具体举动尚待９日听取美国观察员代表团汇报之后作出决定。
    几位刚刚从巴拿马返回的观察员（国会议员）一致认为，诺列加将军在选举中搞“欺骗”。
    另据美国三大电视网分析，如果诺列加“偷窃”选举结果，摆在布什政府面前的几种可能选择是：直接使用武力、废除美巴１９７９年签署的《巴拿马运河条约》、加强经济制裁和向美驻巴拿马运河区军事基地增派军队。它们还估计，美国政府可能选择最后一种方案。不过，布什总统今天向哥伦比亚广播公司驻白宫记者表示，他将采取“谨慎”态度。
