Over the past few decades, numerous art museums have emerged in Western countries. However, the Louvre, situated on the banks of the Seine River in Paris (the national art museum of France), has retained its authoritative position in the world due to its rich history and extensive collections.

As a palace building, the Louvre itself holds high artistic value and historical significance. Tracing its origins, it was initially a castle built in 1190 (the first year of the Shaoxi era during China's Southern Song Dynasty) by the king to store gold, jewels, and artistic treasures. In the 14th century, it became the royal palace of Charles V, who also collected books and artifacts, establishing a substantial royal collection. In the early 16th century, Francis I demolished the old palace and rebuilt a more magnificent new palace in the style of the Italian Renaissance of the same period. He also acquired many masterpieces from Italian artists, enriching the existing collection. Subsequently, until the mid-17th century, under the supervision of several kings and the meticulous work of several art masters, the architecture and collections of the Louvre became even more perfect.

The transformation of the Louvre from a royal palace to a museum was significantly driven by Louis XIV (reigned 1643–1715) and his chief minister, Colbert. Through various means, they greatly expanded the collection. For example, in 1671, they acquired a large number of sketches by famous painters from the banker Jabach, which formed the basis for the "Department of Drawings" in the museum. Colbert also established the Royal Academy of Art with the chief court painter Le Brun, and exhibited portraits of the king, queen, ministers, and court life in the palace. Although the purpose was to propagate royal power, it also set the trend for modern art exhibitions. In 1792, the monarchy was overthrown, and the Louvre was transferred to the French Republic. The following year, most of the treasures in the palace were publicly displayed, thus becoming a modern museum. Subsequently, Napoleon's conquests brought many artistic treasures to the Louvre, which were stored there. After his fall, most of these treasures were returned to their original owners, but the "Winged Victory of Samothrace" and the Venus de Milo from the island of Milos were retained, along with Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece "Mona Lisa," which had been acquired in the 16th century, becoming rare treasures in the Louvre's collection.

Influenced by the spirit of modern science, the Louvre has undergone continuous construction and reform, eventually becoming a model art museum. A large number of precious artworks are arranged by historical period from ancient to modern times. This can also be seen in the series of programs "The Louvre" recently broadcasted by China Central Television. According to Western concepts, a museum is a scholarly institution. The Louvre Museum was the first to establish this system. It has a richly stocked library and many research departments composed of experts. To popularize art knowledge and cultivate specialists in art history among the general public, the museum also holds lectures given by experts. In 1928, Fu Lei was studying at the University of Paris and simultaneously attending lectures on Western art history at the Louvre. After returning to China, he focused on translating Western literary classics, achieving remarkable results, but also translated Diderot's famous work "The Philosophy of Art" and authored "Twenty Lectures on World Art Masterpieces." In these two books and many fragments seen in "Family Letters of Fu Lei," one can see his rich knowledge and deep insights into Western art, the foundation of which was laid during his lectures at the Louvre.

The Louvre has set a model for museums around the world. However, as time progresses, it faces many new problems. For example, although the palace is spacious, the available space is still limited, making it difficult to display the numerous masterpieces stored in the warehouse and those emerging on the art scene. Additionally, it must adapt to modern life and incorporate some modern elements. Thus, six years ago, a construction plan was proposed: to open a large underground museum in front of the palace, covered by a glass pyramid above ground, both to bring natural light into the underground building and to add a modern touch to the ancient palace on the surface. This plan, after much controversy, was finally acknowledged as the only feasible option, and construction began, with the entrance completed last year (1988). It is said that after the "underground museum" is fully completed in 1993, in addition to displaying works, it will also house parking lots, bookstores, retail shops, dining halls, and a lecture hall with 400 seats. It is also said that due to this expansion, the Louvre will continue to hold the title of "the world's largest art museum," with an annual visitor count reaching 6 million...

Looking at our country, the Forbidden City is a gem of Eastern palace architecture, and the art and cultural relics collected within are extremely rich and precious. However, as a museum, when will it catch up with the world's advanced standards? The underground museum in front of the Louvre, topped with a "glass pyramid," was designed by the world-renowned architect I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American. We hope that conditions will be created soon for him to contribute to his homeland. There is great hope!

　　闲话卢浮宫
    吴甲丰
    近数十年来，西方各国涌现出大量的艺术博物馆。但坐落在巴黎赛纳河畔的卢浮宫（法国的国家艺术博物馆），由于历史悠久、收藏丰富，仍然没有失掉它在全世界的权威地位。
    作为宫殿建筑，卢浮宫本身就有很高的艺术价值和历史意义。追本溯源，它最初是１１９０年（我国南宋绍熙元年）建立的一座城堡，当时的国王用以收藏金珠宝贝和艺术珍品。１４世纪，它成为查理五世的王宫，同时广搜图书文物，建立起颇具规模的王室收藏。１６世纪初期，佛朗索瓦一世将旧宫拆毁，仿照同时期意大利文艺复兴的风格，在原址另建更加宏伟的新宫。他又搜罗不少意大利艺术大师的杰作，使原有的收藏更加丰富。随后至１７世纪中叶，在好几个国王的主持下，经过好几个艺术大师的匠心经营，使卢浮宫的建筑和收藏更臻完美。
    将卢浮宫从王宫发展为博物馆，起了推动作用的还数路易十四（在位１６４３—１７１５）及其辅政大臣科尔伯特。他们通过各种手段，大大扩充了收藏，例如，１６７１年他们获得了银行家雅巴什所藏大量名画家素描手迹，现在馆中“素描作品部”，就是以这个收藏为基础而建立的。科尔伯特又与当时首席宫廷画家勒·布朗建立王家艺术学院，又在宫中展出描绘国王、后妃、大臣肖像以及宫廷生活的作品，尽管目的是宣扬王权，却也开了近代艺术展览会的风气。１７９２年帝制被推翻，卢浮宫收归法兰西共和国，次年将宫中收藏的大部分珍品公开展出，从此成为一个近代意义的博物馆（ｍｕｓｅｕｍ）。接着拿破仑出征各国，将掠夺来的艺术珍品都贮存于卢浮宫，他下台后，大部分归还原主，但“尼克胜利女神”和米罗岛的维纳斯这两座希腊雕像却得以保留下来，连同１６世纪就已获得的芬奇名作《莫娜丽莎》，成为卢浮宫收藏中的稀世之珍。
    受了近现代科学精神的洗礼，卢浮宫经过不断建设和革新，终于成为一个堪称典范的艺术博物馆。大量珍贵的艺术作品，从古到今按历史时期编排，在最近中央电视台播放的系列片《卢浮宫》中，也可以看到这一情况。依据西方概念，博物馆是一个学术机构，卢浮宫博物馆率先建立了这个体制。它拥有收藏丰富的图书馆，也设置许多由专家组成的研究部门。为了向广大群众普及艺术知识和培养艺术史的专门人才，馆中也设立讲座，由专家主讲。１９２８年，傅雷正留学法国，在巴黎大学文科学习，同时也在卢浮宫听讲西方艺术史。他归国后注力于西方文学名著的翻译工作，成绩卓著，但也翻译了丹纳的名著《艺术哲学》，著作了《世界美术名作二十讲》。在这两册书和见于《傅雷家书》中的许多片断中，都可以看出他对于西方艺术有丰富的知识和深刻的见解，而这方面的基础就是在卢浮宫听课时奠定的。
    卢浮宫为全世界后起的博物馆树立了一个典范。但时代不断前进，它也面临许多新的问题，例如，宫殿尽管宽广，可资利用的空间却毕竟有限，积压在库房中的和艺坛上不断涌现的佳作，很难在展厅中占一席位。另外也得适应现代生活而搞一点现代化。于是，六年前出现了一个建设方案：在宫殿前面的场地上开辟大面积的“地下博物馆”，上面覆盖一个露于地面的“玻璃金字塔”，既用以给地下建筑输送天光，也给地面上的古老宫殿添几分现代的神采。这个计划提出后，受到了法国许多文化权威的强烈反对，但几经争议，大家终于承认它是唯一可以采用的方案，于是开始建造，并且于去年（１９８８年）建成了入口处。据说，这个“地下博物馆”于１９９３年全部竣工后，除了陈列作品外，还用以设置停车间、售书亭、零售店、食堂，外加一个拥有４００个座位的讲堂。又据说，由于这种扩建，卢浮宫更将保持“世界上最大艺术博物馆”的荣誉，每年观众将达６００万人次……
    返观我国，故宫堪称东方宫殿建筑中的瑰宝，而其中收藏的艺术文物也十分丰富、极其珍贵。但作为一座博物院，不知何时能赶上世界先进水平？卢浮宫前那个以“玻璃金字塔”盖顶的地下博物馆，设计者为世界闻名的华裔建筑师贝聿铭先生，盼望我们早日创造条件让他能插手为祖国效劳。有厚望焉！
