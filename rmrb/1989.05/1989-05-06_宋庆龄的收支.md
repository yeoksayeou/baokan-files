Comrade Song Qingling's monthly salary was over five hundred yuan, but she spent almost all of it each month.

The bodyguards of Dr. Sun Yat-sen were still alive, and there were three of them in their seventies and eighties. For many years, Song Qingling sent them twenty to thirty yuan each month without fail, helping them to live out their later years in happiness.

Song Qingling had fifty to sixty staff members around her, and in her mind, she kept another set of accounts: whoever had family difficulties, many children, or elderly relatives who were sick or had suffered disasters, she would always provide some assistance, sending money to these comrades' families.

There was a security secretary who had been paralyzed for over ten years, with two daughters by his side, and their life was quite tight. Song Qingling started sending them money every month when the two girls were four or five years old, almost covering all their expenses for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.

During festivals and holidays, Song Qingling's expenses were even greater. She would invite all the staff members and their children to come over, eat together, play games, and watch movies.

Every Sunday, Song Qingling would spend her own money to improve the lives of a few single staff members. She generously bought them good food, making them feel happy and enjoy their holidays.

These fixed expenses were a significant amount, and combined with Song Qingling's own living expenses, there was almost nothing left each month.

　　宋庆龄的收支
    宋庆龄同志每月工资五百多元，而每月开支花得几乎所剩无几。
    孙中山先生生前的卫士，那时家中还有三人活在世上，都已经是七八十岁的老人了。多年来，宋庆龄每月不误，分别寄给他们二三十元生活补贴费，帮助他们幸福地度过晚年。
    宋庆龄身边有五六十位工作人员，在她的心目中另有一本帐目：谁的家庭困难，子女多，老人患病或遭灾遭难，她总是不时地给予一些照顾，寄钱给这些同志的家里。
    有位警卫秘书，瘫痪了十多年，身边有两个女儿，生活比较紧张。宋庆龄从这两个孩子四五岁起，就每月寄给他们一笔钱，几乎担负起了她俩衣食住行的全部开销。
    逢年过节，宋庆龄的开销更大。她总是把所有工作人员和他们的孩子全部请来，一块吃饭、做游戏、看电影。
    每个星期天，宋庆龄总是要自己掏钱给几位单身的工作人员改善生活。她慷慨大方地买来好吃的东西，使他们心情舒畅，假日愉快。
    这些固定的开支是笔不小的数目，加上宋庆龄自己的生活费用，每月就所剩无几了。
