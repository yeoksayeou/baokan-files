Also discussing the revision of "And Quiet Flows the Don"

    In the article "Recalling the Translation and Revision of 'And Quiet Flows the Don'" (hereinafter referred to as "Recalling"), Jia Gang recounts Sholokhov's several major revisions of "And Quiet Flows the Don." This leads to the discussion of the relationship between the 1953 edition of the book and the "Stalin phenomenon," and concludes: "In order to cater to Stalin and his official critics, to please Stalin, the author reluctantly made extensive revisions to the initial edition." As far as I know, this does not accord with the facts.

    The Moscow "Writers" Publishing House published "How 'And Quiet Flows the Don' Was Created" (hereinafter referred to as "Creation") in 1980. The author is Professor B. Gura. The book reveals many important events that occurred during the creation of this world-renowned work; it first published many important materials that had been sealed for many years, such as the contents of Gorky's letter to Fadeyev in 1931 regarding the publication of the third part of "And Quiet Flows the Don," as well as the entire revision process of the book over more than half a century of publication. It is a very important work in the study of "And Quiet Flows the Don." The relevant contents are briefly introduced as follows.

    "And Quiet Flows the Don" was completed in 1940. By the 1980s, there had been 27 standalone editions and 32 versions. Each edition had differences. Some were due to the editor; some were changes made by the author. The editions with significant content changes were the 1946 edition by the Moscow "Pravda" Publishing House and the 1953 edition by the Moscow State Publishing House. The latter was the most extensive revision after the manuscript was completed. However, it was not the work of the author alone. Hundreds of deletions and revisions throughout the book, including the content mentioned in "Recalling" that is suspected of being sycophantic, were mostly made by the responsible editor K. Potapov. It must be pointed out that the author basically held a negative attitude towards the editor's revisions. According to "Creation," Sholokhov had several sharp conflicts with Potapov at that time, but the editor ultimately won. For this, Potapov published a postscript with the book, in which there were some subtle criticisms of the author's "ideological limitations." The statement in "Recalling" that the "1953 edition is completely a product of the Stalin phenomenon" is correct, but the author should not bear the main or all the responsibility. "Creation" records Sholokhov's extreme dissatisfaction at that time. In his correspondence, he emphasized: "It should be said that although Potapov had good intentions for the novel, as an editor... he was not qualified. He lacks artistic taste. From each of his revisions, you can see that he is a very mediocre person, and unfortunately, that is the case! I made a mistake in choosing the editor and regret it." It can be seen that he was also very painful.

    Between 1956 and 1960, the Soviet State Publishing House and the "Young Guard" Publishing House simultaneously published the first "Sholokhov Selected Works." It was at this time that Sholokhov personally restored most of the changes made in the 1953 edition, with the target again being Potapov's "masterpieces." From 1962 to the present, the content of the six selected works editions and all other standalone editions, including the 1964 edition by the "News" Publishing House and the 1980 selected works edition by the "Pravda" Publishing House mentioned in "Recalling," has hardly been changed again. Therefore, the best definitive edition of "And Quiet Flows the Don" should be its initial selected works edition.

    Sholokhov's attitude towards Stalin indeed had elements of flattery, which no one can deny. This was the result of the abnormal political life of the state at that time. But the author's artistic pursuit had a completely different manifestation. This is also acknowledged by scholars at home and abroad. His lifelong struggle was to insist on the historical truth reflected in his works and the artistic truth achieved by this expression.

　　也谈《静静的顿河》的修改
    刘铁
    贾刚同志《〈静静的顿河〉校译忆往》（以下简称《忆往》）一文中叙述了肖洛霍夫对《静静的顿河》的几次重大修改。由此提到该书１９５３年本同“斯大林现象”的关系，并得出结论：“作家为了迎合斯大林及御用评论家的批评，取悦斯大林，违心地对初版进行了大规模的修改”。据我所知，这与史实不符。
    莫斯科“作家”出版社１９８０年出版了《〈静静的顿河〉是怎样创作的》（以下简称《创作》）一书，作者是Ｂ·古拉教授。该书披露了围绕这部世界名著问世过程发生的许多重要事件；首次发表了许多曾被封锁多年的重要资料，诸如高尔基１９３１年为出版《静静的顿河》第三部致法捷耶夫的信中另外一些内容，以及该书在半个多世纪漫长出版过程中的全部修改经过。它是《静静的顿河》研究史上很重要的一部著作。现将其中有关内容简介如下。
    《静静的顿河》在１９４０年结束创作后，至８０年代，仅单行本就出版了２７种３２版之多。其内容可说次次都有出入。有的系编辑所为；有的是作家所改。内容改动较大的是１９４６年的莫斯科《真理报》出版社本和１９５３年的莫斯科国家出版社本。后者是小说完稿后改动最大的一次。但又非出自作者一人之手。全书数百处删改，包括《忆往》所举有谄媚之嫌的内容，绝大部分为责任编辑Ｋ·波塔波夫所为。必须指出，作者对编辑的这种修改基本是持否定态度的。据《创作》介绍，肖洛霍夫当时同波塔波夫发生过多次尖锐冲突，但胜者最终是编辑。为此，波塔波夫随该书发表了一篇后记，其中不乏对作者“思想局限”的微辞。《忆往》所说“１９５３年版完全是斯大林现象的产物”，一点没错，但不该让作家承担主要或全部责任。《创作》记录了肖洛霍夫当时对此的极其不满。他在与人通信时强调：“应该说，尽管波塔波夫出于对长篇的好心，但他作为编辑……是不够格的。他没有艺术口味。从他的每次改动中，您都能看出这是个十分平庸的人，不幸就在于此！在选择编辑上我犯了错误，也为此而后悔。”可见他也是十分痛苦的。
    １９５６—１９６０年间，苏联国家出版社和“青年近卫军”出版社同时首次出版《肖洛霍夫选集》。正是在这时，肖洛霍夫亲自恢复了１９５３年版中绝大部分改动，其对象又以波塔波夫的“杰作”居多。从１９６２年至今的六种选集本及所有其他单行本，包括《忆往》提到的１９６４年《消息报》出版社本、１９８０年《真理报》出版社选集本，内容几乎都未再做改动。因此，《静静的顿河》的最佳定本应当是其最初选集本。
    肖洛霍夫本人对斯大林的态度确有曲意奉迎之处，这是谁都不可否认的。这是那个时代国家政治生活非正常化的结果。但作者在其艺术的追求上有着迥然不同于此的表现。这也是苏联国内外学者首肯的。他的毕生奋斗，就在于坚持其作品所反映的历史真实与这种表现所达到的艺术真实。
