After the People's Daily published the article "Students, Eventually Returning to the Motherland's Embrace" on March 1, some readers inquired: How many people have returned to Shanghai after completing their studies? What is their situation and feelings after returning to a less affluent motherland? With these questions in mind, the reporters began a new search...

The "outbound wave" that has not receded for years has caused many units to frequently lack talent: A certain orchestra in Shanghai has 50 people who have gone abroad, almost half of the orchestra has left, and some research institutes have too many people going abroad, so some important projects have to be cut; among the nearly 30% of public foreign language teachers in more than 50 universities in the city who have gone abroad or are about to go abroad, the workload of those left behind has doubled...

The density of talent in our country is originally low. It is known that Japan has 2,000 professional personnel per 10,000 people, Poland 1,500, Yugoslavia 1,200, and Shanghai only 500. Nationwide, this ratio is even lower.

A dilemma in life thus stands before the students abroad: The motherland is currently not as economically developed as developed countries. Should one stay abroad for a long time or return to the motherland early to work with the people to build a prosperous China?

They are choosing carefully. A graduate student pondered: "Doing the same experiment, one can earn at least $7,000 a year in the United States, while in China, the annual income is at most 2,000 yuan. Should one 'return' or 'stay'?"

"Returning early is not as good as returning late, and returning late is not as good as not returning at all." Some also say.

In terms of material conditions, the republic that has just turned 40 this year and nurtures 1/5 of the world's population naturally cannot compare with rich countries that have been on the road for a hundred or two hundred years. However, the hearts of the students are indeed filled with a green shade of patriotism.

Lin Huaxin, who self-financed his studies in the United States and obtained a Ph.D., has been teaching in the United States. His wife, Liu Jinjuan, is six months pregnant. The couple has a stable income in the United States, a car, and a spacious and beautiful house in the scenic area. However, in June last year, the two flew to Shanghai and picked up the teaching baton at East China Normal University and Shanghai Jiaotong University, respectively. They said: "Although the United States is rich, it is someone else's; although the motherland is a bit poor, it is still ours. We have the responsibility to return and build it in our later years." Some friends said Liu Jinjuan should give birth in the United States and then return to China. Lin Huaxin explained with a smile: "We do not want to be Americans, nor do we want our children to be Americans!"

At the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, there is still a story of a person who was expelled but insisted on returning to the country. His name is Ding Dafu, a 49-year-old associate researcher. In June 1985, he was sent to Belgium for self-financed studies in developmental biology, and then transferred to Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. When he went to the Federal Republic of Germany "to borrow foreign money to complete a project," he received a "dismissal notice" from the institute. He cried in pain. Family members and friends advised him to "just not return to the country," but he said, "No, I will return to the country as soon as I complete the project." As for the dismissal, he said: "I do not believe this is the country's policy!" In fact, the institute dismissed him to free up the personnel quota. In the spring of 1988, Ding Dafu returned to the Biochemistry Institute three months overdue. As soon as he entered the office, the director rushed up to embrace him tightly...

Boat after boat returns to the peaceful harbor. So far, more than 10,000 people have returned to Shanghai after completing their studies. "No matter what, Chinese people cannot forget their roots!" Liu Fan, a Ph.D. from Shanghai Jiaotong University who returned from Japan, said. These words are also the voice from the hearts of many students.

Despite the efforts of various levels of government and departments to create some conditions for returning students, the problems of insufficient scientific research funds, backward experimental equipment, and relatively poor working and living environments due to limited economic strength still pose difficulties for some returning students. The relevant departments of Shanghai Municipality once surveyed more than 300 returning scholars, and nearly half of them filled in "poor scientific research conditions" in the column "the problem you find most troublesome."

Hong Guofan, a researcher who first created the non-random determination method of deoxyribonucleic acid in the world, took on a national key project after returning to the country, but the sodium chloride, sucrose, and isotopes used in his experiments were often out of stock, and some experiments had to be suspended.

Two associate researchers in a certain unit achieved scientific research results that filled the gap in China abroad, but after returning to the country, due to the lack of scientific research funds, they had to work as assistants in other project groups.

An engineer from a certain institute returned from the United States, but due to the lack of housing resources in the institute, his family of three lived in a 10-square-meter room for four years.

Facing unavoidable difficulties, it is understandable that students have sighs, complaints, and even grievances. "The motherland has changed a lot in these years, but there are indeed many problems." A couple who returned from the United States said frankly: "Fortunately, we estimated the difficulties we might encounter after returning to the country while we were abroad, otherwise, we would really not be able to bear it!"

There are difficulties, but it is not hopeless. Two years ago, Wu Guoguang, who returned from the United States, was a master at overcoming difficulties. This associate researcher, as soon as he stepped into the Shanghai Blood Transfusion Research Institute after returning to the country, faced the first difficulty of lacking a laboratory. He was anxious and quickly wrote a report to the State Science and Technology Commission, but the answer was "no money." He was not willing to give up and turned to the Municipal Health Bureau for help, but there was still no money. He was still not willing to give up and visited the Municipal Science and Technology Personnel Bureau, and after much persuasion, he finally obtained 10,000 yuan. It was not enough, so he thought of ways to let the Ministry of Health support another 10,000 yuan. Later, he also borrowed some instruments and equipment from the brother's room. Now he finally has a laboratory, and the national key project he and his colleagues are undertaking has also started.

The limited conditions of the motherland made Wu Guoguang spend a full year and eight months to build the laboratory. His experience verified a sentence that Professor Lee Tsung-Dao often said when seeing off Chinese students: "Do not be afraid of difficulties after returning. Working conditions mainly rely on your own efforts! You will succeed!"

Yang Shengli and Wu Ruping of the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, were also once in the predicament of "not even having a refrigerator to store biochemical reagents" after returning to the country in 1982. "Later, we understood that the main reason was that the institute had no money," the two recalled: "So we no longer complained, but instead focused on finding ways for ourselves, applying for scientific research funds from relevant national departments on the one hand, and borrowing some equipment to carry out work on the other." By the spring of 1988, they not only built the laboratory but also successfully developed the penicillin acylase gene engineering bacterium, increasing the penicillin yield by about 15 times compared to the original industrial strain, and the main indicators are at the international leading level. As the first intermediate test of a gene engineering project in China, this achievement was listed as one of the top ten achievements of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1988.

The country has difficulties, and everyone shares the burden. Year after year, the returning students, relying on their sincerity and understanding of the motherland, carry on the heavy burden. According to a sample survey, among the 7,000 scientific research personnel who returned to Shanghai, the majority have already achieved results. Among the 208 teachers who returned to study abroad from Shanghai Jiaotong University, 107 have been appointed as associate professors due to their outstanding achievements.

"Leave students should have some special policies"

On November 27 last year, a letter from a returning student was sent to the desk of Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji.

In the letter, 35-year-old Xiao Jian wrote that he was admitted to the MBA training class jointly organized by the State Economic Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce in May 1985, and was evaluated as an "outstanding graduate student" by the School of Management of the State University of New York upon graduation. However, more than a year after returning to the country, his unit had not yet assigned him a specific job. "I am already close to middle age, and if I drag on any longer, it will be detrimental to both the country and myself, so I have the idea of moving to Hainan, Shenzhen, or even going abroad again." The end of the letter also attached a poem with sorrow: "Han Xin fled to Chu, and Wu Zixu crossed the Shaoguan Pass. The rise and fall of history, I do not care about the heavens!"

After reading the letter, Mayor Zhu immediately instructed a vice mayor and the director of the Municipal Personnel Bureau to solve the problem. He also added a sentence: "There should be some special policies for leave students."

In some developed countries, the role of technological progress in economic growth has reached 70%, far exceeding the role of increased labor and capital investment. Therefore, people who master scientific and technological and managerial skills have become treasures; therefore, some countries have successively amended immigration laws to attract professional talents from developing countries. Countries with a large number of talent losses such as India, the Philippines, and Egypt, Pakistan, etc., have also formulated countermeasures to call back overseas students.

Facing a pair of expectant eyes and the increasingly fierce international talent competition, the responsible person of the State Education Commission said: The policy towards leave students, we should have a strategic vision, stand higher, and look further!

The State Education Commission has specially held a meeting to implement the relevant instructions of the central government and made new arrangements for the placement of leave students, requiring local governments to "take effective measures to arrange the work of leave students who return to the country."

In the spring of April, warm news also came from the Shanghai Municipal Personnel Bureau: The bureau has held four large-scale seminars to listen to the opinions and suggestions of leave students and relevant personnel cadres, further improve the work level; a series of "special policies" are being formulated in an urgent manner, including guaranteeing the work and living arrangements of leave students, allowing talent flow, etc. The Shanghai Leave Students Service Center is also being set up in a hurry. Once it is established, the "center" will collect and timely release talent demand information to the outside world and provide guidance and services for leave students to choose jobs...

This is just the beginning. But this is indeed the information of spring, the information of hope!

### 有赤诚也有期待——上海留学人员回国以后

　　有赤诚也有期待   
    ——上海留学人员回国以后
    新华社记者  邬鸣飞  刘军
  　《人民日报》３月１日发表《学子，终将扑向母亲怀抱》的报道后，有些读者询问：上海目前已有多少人学成归来？他们回到不富裕的祖国后境遇如何，感觉又怎样？带着这些疑团，记者开始了新的寻觅……
    ２０００元人民币与７０００美元之间的选择
    数年不退的“出国潮”，使许多单位人才频频告缺：
    上海某乐团有５０多人出国，几乎走掉了半个团，有些研究所出国人员过多，一些重要课题只得砍掉；全市５０多所高校的公共外语课教师出国或即将出国的近３０％，留下者工作量倍增……
    我国人才密度本来就低。据悉，日本每万人拥有专业人员２０００人，波兰１５００人，南斯拉夫１２００人，而上海只有５００人。在全国，这个比例更低。
    一道人生的难题，由此横亘在身居异域的学子面前：祖国目前经济上远不及发达国家，是在国外长期呆下去，还是早日回国，与人民同舟共济，建设中华？
    他们在审慎地选择。一位研究生思量着：“同样做实验，在美国每年至少可以拿７０００美元，在国内年收入充其量是２０００元。是‘回’还是‘留’？”
    “早回国不如迟回国，迟回国不如不回国。”也有的这样说。
    单论物质条件，养育着世界１／５的人口、今年刚满４０岁的共和国，自然比不过走了一二百年路程的富国。然而莘莘学子的心里，毕竟有一片爱国的绿荫。
    自费留美获得博士学位的林华新已在美国任教，妻子刘锦娟已有６个月身孕。小俩口在美有稳定收入，有小汽车，坐落在游览区的住宅也宽敞、漂亮。然而去年６月，两人却一道飞抵上海，分别到华东师范大学和上海交大拿起了教鞭。他们说：“美国虽然富裕，但那是人家的；祖国虽然穷一些，但她毕竟是我们自己的。我们后半辈子有责任回来建设她。”有些朋友说刘锦娟应在美国生下孩子再回国，林华新则笑着解释：“我们不愿当美国人，也不愿让孩子当美国人啊！”
    在中国科学院上海生化研究所，还流传着一个被除名者执意回国的故事。他叫丁达夫，４９岁的副研究员。１９８５年６月，他自费公派到比利时进修发育生物学，尔后又辗转加拿大、美国和英国，当他前往联邦德国“想借助外国的钱再完成一个课题”时，接到了所里发的“除名通知书”。他伤心得哭了。家人和好友劝他“干脆不要回国了”，“不，我一完成课题就回国。”至于除名，他说：“我不相信这是祖国的大政策！”其实所里对他“除名”，也是为了腾出人员编制。１９８８年春天，丁达夫在逾期三个月后返回生化所，一进办公室，所长就迎上去与他紧紧拥抱……
    一艘艘小船回到宁静的港湾。到目前为止，上海已有１万余人学成归来。“中国人，怎么也忘不了自己的根！”留日归国的上海交通大学博士刘凡说。这话，也是众多学子内心深处的声音。
    是埋怨还是埋头
    尽管各级政府和部门为留学回国人员创造了一些条件，但经济实力不强带来的科研经费不足、实验设备落后、工作和生活环境较差等问题，确实还难为着一些归来的儿女。上海市有关部门曾对３００余名归国学者进行调查，在“你最感头痛的问题”一栏中，近一半人填了“科研条件差”。
    在世界上首创脱氧核糖核酸非随机测定方法的研究员洪国藩，回国后承担了一项国家重点攻关课题，但他实验用的氯化钠、蔗糖和同位素时常缺货，有些实验只得中断。
    某单位有两位副研究员在国外取得填补我国空白的科研成果，回国后由于缺乏科研经费，只好到其它课题组当助手。
    某所一位工程师留美归来后，由于所里实在没有房源，全家３口人在１０平方米的小屋里呆了４年。
    面对不容回避的困难，学子们有叹息、埋怨甚至牢骚是很可理解的。“祖国这些年变化很大，但问题确实也不少。”一对留美回来的夫妇坦诚地说：“好在我们在国外就估计到了回国后可能遇到的困难，否则真有点受不了啦！”
    有困难，但也并非束手无策。两年前留美回国的吴国光，就是埋头克服困难的能手。这位副研究员归来一踏进上海市输血研究所，头号难题是缺少实验室。他急了，赶紧写报告给国家科委，得到的回答是“没有钱”。他不甘心，转而求援于市卫生局，也没有钱。他仍然不死心，又走访市科技干部局，好说歹说，总算批给１万元。不够，他又想方设法让卫生部支持了１万元。后来又向兄弟室组借了一些仪器设备。如今他终于有了实验室，他和同伴承担的一项国家攻关项目也上马了。
    祖国条件有限，使吴国光耗费了整整１年零８个月才建成实验室。他的这段经历，应验了李政道教授送别中国留学生时常说的一句话：“回去后不要怕困难。工作条件，主要靠自己争取！你们会成功的！”
    中科院上海药物所的杨胜利、吴汝平，１９８２年回国后也一度陷入“连贮藏生化试剂的冰箱也没有”的苦恼。“后来理解了，主要是所里没有钱”，两人回忆道：“于是我们再也不埋怨了，而是立足于自己想办法，一边向国家有关部门申请科研经费，一边借用一些设备开展工作。”到１９８８年春天，他们不仅建起了实验室，而且成功地研制出青霉素酰化酶基因工程菌，使青霉素产量比原来工业生产菌株提高１５倍左右，主要指标居国际领先地位。作为我国第一个完成中试的基因工程项目，这项成果被列为中科院１９８８年十大成果之一。
    国家有困难，大家来分担。一年又一年，归来的儿女靠着对祖国的赤诚和理解负重长跑。据抽样调查，上海回来的７０００名出国科研人员中，大多数已经出了成果。上海交通大学留学回国的２０８名教师，已有１０７名因成果显著被聘任为正、副教授。
    “对留学生要有点特殊政策”
    去年１１月２７日，一位留学回国人员的来信送到上海市长朱熔基的案头。
    ３５岁的肖剑在信中诉说，他１９８５年５月考入国家经委与美国商务部合办的ＭＢＡ培训班，毕业时被纽约州立大学管理学院评为“出色的研究生”，然而回国一年多，本单位还未分配他具体工作。“我已近中年，再拖下去于国于己都不利，因而萌发了流动去海南、深圳甚至再次出国的念头。”信的末端还悲伤地附诗一首：“韩信楚奔汉，子胥过韶关，兴衰千古事，我意不问天！”
    朱市长阅信后，当即批请一位副市长和市人事局长解决此事。后面还特意加上一句：“对留学生要有点特殊政策。”
    在一些发达国家，技术进步在经济增长中所起的作用已高达７０％，远远超过劳力与资本投入增加所起的作用。于是，掌握科学技术与管理技能的人才成了宝贝；于是一些国家相继修改移民法规吸引发展中国家的专业人才。人才流失颇多的印度、菲律宾以及埃及、巴基斯坦等国也纷纷制订对策，以召回海外学子。
    面对一双双期待的目光和日趋激烈的国际人才大竞争，国家教委负责人说：对待留学人员政策，我们要有战略眼光，站得高一点，看得远一点！
    国家教委已专门开会贯彻中央有关指示，就留学人员回国安置问题作出了新的部署，要求各地“采取有力的措施安排好回国留学人员的工作”。
    暮春４月，从上海市人事局也传出暖融融的信息：局里已四次召开大型座谈会，听取留学回国人员和有关人事干部的意见和建议，进一步提高工作水平；一系列“特殊政策”在紧锣密鼓地制订之中，其中包括保证留学回国人员的工作和生活安排、允许人才流动等内容。上海市留学生服务中心也在抓紧筹建，一旦挂牌，“中心”将搜集并及时向海外发布人才需求信息，为留学回国人员选择工作提供指导和服务……
    这仅仅是个开端。但这毕竟是春天里的信息，是给人希望的信息！
