The All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) held a meeting of its standing committee in Beijing on the morning of May 29. The meeting seriously studied and discussed the speeches given by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the meeting of Party, government, and military cadres in the capital. The attendees unanimously agreed that in this serious political struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the future of the country, we must maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee in our thoughts and actions. We must firmly support the correct decisions and work arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and make our due contributions to quickly stopping the turmoil and maintaining national stability and unity. Comrade Chen Mu Hua presided over the meeting and made a speech.

The meeting emphasized: Firmly stopping the turmoil, maintaining the Party's leadership, maintaining the socialist system, and maintaining national stability and unity are the overriding tasks at present. They are major issues concerning the fundamental and long-term interests of the broad masses of the people and the broad masses of women. Cadres of women's federations at all levels and women of all nationalities and all walks of life must recognize the current grave situation, take a firm stand, and clearly oppose the plots of a very small number of people. They must support the Party and the government's correct decisions and resolute measures to stabilize the situation with practical actions.

The meeting earnestly hoped that all female workers, peasants, cadres, intellectuals, military personnel, students, and the people across the country would stay at their posts and continue production. It hoped that all parents and mothers would educate their children and relatives to recognize the situation, consider the overall interests, and observe discipline. It hoped that the broad masses of women would resolutely not believe in rumors, not participate in marches and petitions, stop going out to watch and support activities, and hoped that female students would cherish their precious study time and quickly return to school to resume classes. They should contribute to the quick restoration of normal production, work, teaching, and living order in the capital and across the country.

The meeting believed that the officers and soldiers of the troops who came to Beijing to carry out martial law tasks had written a new chapter of supporting the government and loving the people under special conditions with their practical actions. They had made great contributions to restoring the order of the capital and stabilizing the situation in Beijing and even across the country. They were indeed the strong pillars of the People's Republic. The meeting expressed high respect and warm regards to them. The meeting sincerely thanked the public security police, armed police, PLA soldiers, medical workers, and workers on all fronts who had been guarding their posts day and night to maintain the normal order of the capital and across the country, ensure the people's lives and health, and made great contributions. It hoped that women's federations at all levels and the broad masses of women would actively support them in carrying out their tasks and assist them in doing their work. Together, they would make new contributions to ending the chaotic situation, maintaining stability and unity, promoting reform and construction, and safeguarding national dignity.

The meeting unanimously supported and endorsed the State Council's emergency notice on "Firmly Stopping Students from Rushing into Trains and Forcibly Entering Beijing." It called on students from other places not to come to Beijing and other major and medium-sized cities to support activities. It called on young students who were still stranded in Tiananmen Square and other places to leave the square quickly for their own health and studies and return to school to resume classes.

The meeting firmly supported and endorsed the correct arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council leadership to persist in protecting the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students, conduct extensive dialogues through multiple levels, channels, and forms, listen to the opinions of the masses, and genuinely improve the work of the Party and the government. In this regard, women's federations at all levels should assist the Party and the government in opening up dialogue channels, actively reflecting the criticisms, opinions, suggestions, and demands of the broad masses for promoting democracy, improving the legal system, practicing clean government, and promoting reform and construction, and fully playing the role of bridges and ties between the Party and the government and the broad masses.

Comrade Kang Keqing, honorary chairperson of the ACWF, expressed her firm support for the speeches of Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun and fully agreed with Comrade Chen Mu Hua's presiding over the meeting of the standing committee in Beijing to study and discuss the correct decisions of the Central Committee. She also agreed with the opinions discussed at the meeting of the standing committee in Beijing.

Nineteen standing committee members in Beijing attended the meeting. Comrades Ma Yinu'er, Yang Yanjin, Xing Zhikang, and Wang Shouchu, who were out of town, called to express their complete agreement after learning about the opinions discussed at the meeting of the standing committee in Beijing.

The State Council's Office of Advisors recently sent a letter to Premier Li Peng and the State Council, proposing four suggestions for stabilizing the situation and achieving long-term stability. The full text is as follows:

To Premier Li Peng and the State Council:

In recent days, we advisors of the State Council (except those who are sick or away) have studied the speeches given by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the meeting of Party, government, and military cadres in the capital on May 19. We believe that in the past month, a very small number of people have been plotting politically and creating turmoil. Their goal is to negate the leadership of the Communist Party of China and negate the socialist system. At this critical moment concerning the fate of the country, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have made the correct and timely decision to firmly stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation, and to implement martial law in some areas of the capital. We firmly support this. We are mostly members of democratic parties and non-partisan individuals, and many of us are elderly people in our seventies and eighties. We have experienced both the old and new societies and deeply understand that without the Communist Party of China, there would be no New China; only socialism can save China. The current stable and united situation is hard-won, and without social stability, nothing can be achieved. We firmly support the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and we will maintain the overall stability and unity with the people across the country.

To stabilize the situation and achieve long-term stability, we propose the following suggestions:

1. We suggest that the Communist Party of China and the people's government mobilize people from all walks of life to do a good job of guiding the students, helping them recognize the political plots of a very small number of people, and understand the importance of stability and unity. They should understand that their reasonable demands are consistent with the Party and the government's stance, and these problems need time to solve. We advise them to consider the overall situation and end marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, and strikes as soon as possible, and return to school to resume classes. We also hope that the Party and the government will strictly distinguish between the broad masses of patriotic students and the very small number of people who create turmoil. The reasonable demands raised by the broad masses of young students, such as eradicating corruption, punishing officials who engage in illegal activities, promoting democracy and the rule of law, should be given attention; their patriotic enthusiasm should be affirmed and protected; their excessive words and deeds during the student movement should be treated with tolerance, and no one should be held accountable. Those who incite and create turmoil should be firmly exposed.

2. We suggest that after the situation stabilizes, the Party and the government continue to conduct dialogues with people from all sides, including students, seriously listen to their opinions and suggestions, improve the work of the Party and the government, and further improve the rectification and deepen the reform.

3. We hope that the Party and the government will take resolute and effective measures to speed up the construction of clean government, punish corrupt officials, eliminate various corrupt phenomena, accelerate the construction of democracy and the rule of law, and establish a relatively complete socialist democratic system and legal system, so that the country can quickly move towards the path of democracy and the rule of law.

4. Under the guidance of the line of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, we should strengthen and improve Marxist ideological education and ideological and political work, implement the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and unite the people of all nationalities across the country more closely to strive for the great goal of modernization and the revitalization of China!

    全国妇联名誉主席康克清同志表示坚决拥护李鹏、杨尚昆同志的讲话，完全赞成陈慕华同志主持召开在京常委会议学习讨论中央正确决策，并同意在京常委会讨论的上述意见。
    出席会议的在京常委19人。在外地的常委玛依努尔、杨衍银、邢至康、王守初等同志得知在京常委开会讨论的意见后，都打电话来表示完全同意。
    新华社北京5月30日电国务院参事室日前致函李鹏总理并国务院，为稳定局势和长治久安，提出四点建议。全文如下：李鹏总理并国务院：
    连日来，我们国务院参事（除因病和外出者外）学习了李鹏同志、杨尚昆同志5月19日在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话。大家认为，一个多月来，极少数人搞政治阴谋，制造动乱，他们的目的，就是要否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。在这关系到国家前途命运的关键时刻，中共中央、国务院作出了坚决制止动乱、稳定局势的决策，在首都部分地区实施戒严，这是完全正确的，非常及时的。我们表示坚决拥护。我们这些人大都是民主党派和无党派人士，多是七八十岁的老人，经历过新旧两种社会，深知没有中国共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义才能救中国；现在的安定团结局面来之不易，没有社会的安定，什么也搞不成。我们坚决拥护中国共产党的领导，坚决拥护社会主义制度，并且同全国人民一道维护安定团结的大局。
    为了稳定局势和长治久安，我们提出如下建议：
      （一）建议中国共产党和人民政府广泛动员社会各界人士，做好学生的工作，使他们认清极少数人的政治阴谋，认清安定团结的重要性。使他们懂得，他们的合理要求，同党和政府的主张是一致的，这些问题的解决需要一定的时间。劝说他们顾全大局，尽快结束游行示威、静坐请愿、罢课等活动，回校复课。我们也希望党和政府一定要把广大爱国学生与极少数极少数制造动乱的人严格加以区分。广大青年学生提出的铲除腐败、惩治官倒、促进民主和法制等要求是合理的，应当给予重视；对于他们的爱国热情应当加以肯定和保护；对于他们在学潮中的过激言行，采取宽容态度，一概不予追究。对于极少数煽动和制造动乱的人，应予以坚决揭露。
      （二）建议在局势稳定后，党和政府继续同各方面人士，包括学生在内进行对话，认真听取他们的意见和建议，改进党和政府的工作，进一步搞好治理整顿和深化改革。
      （三）希望党和政府一定要采取坚决有力的措施，加快廉政建设，惩治贪官污吏，消除各种腐败现象，加速民主和法制建设，建立一套比较完备的社会主义民主制度和法律制度，使国家尽快走向民主和法制的道路。
      （四）在党的十三大路线指引下，大力加强和改进马克思主义的思想教育和思想政治工作，把坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化落实到实处，把全国各族人民更加紧密地团结起来，为实现四化、振兴中华这个伟大目标而共同奋斗！
                                    国务院全体参事
                                      1989年5月29日
