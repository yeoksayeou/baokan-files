The New Year had just begun, and I was invited to participate in the "East Asian Calligraphy and Society Symposium," staying in Hawaii for seven days, leaving behind beautiful and profound impressions.

According to local customs, the host placed a lei around my neck. During a break, an elderly woman bowed deeply to me, offering me a drink and a plate of snacks. When I was walking in the corridor, another elderly woman got out of a small car to give me a green ballpoint pen as a souvenir... American friends welcome Eastern guests with flowers, drinks, and friendship.

To understand the dialectical relationship between material civilization and spiritual civilization, Hawaii provides us with a good example. Hawaii not only has fresh air and beautiful scenery, but even the hearts of the people seem to be purified. The University of Hawaii campus is a beautiful garden. Just take the surroundings of the Lincoln Building where I stayed, behind the building is a Japanese-style courtyard designed by the famous architect I.M. Pei, with small bridges, flowing water, winding paths, fragrant flowers, birdsong, and lush grass, making one intoxicated. In the morning and evening, strolling through the campus, teachers and students, whether they know each other or not, greet each other warmly with "Hello!", "Good morning!", "Good evening!" The quality and cultural refinement of the people are evident here. The ancient Chinese politician Guan Zhong had a famous saying: "When the granaries are full, people know etiquette; when clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and shame," which is verified here.

Nevertheless, I do not feel that everything abroad is good, that "the moon abroad is rounder than in China." On the contrary, when I write and present my works to overseas Chinese, I often like to inscribe "The moon is brightest in one's hometown," to evoke the homesickness of overseas travelers. Big countries have big difficulties, small countries have small difficulties, and American society has its own deep-seated diseases and flaws. But overall, the potential of the American nation is profound, the people are striving forward, full of vitality, and the society is developing healthily.

The Hawaiian Islands are isolated from the American mainland, originally a barren and desolate place, now built into a coveted island. It has formed a blood-like connection with the mainland, together constituting a beautiful landscape. Its development history has some lessons for us in building Hainan and coastal regions today.

In Hawaii, there is a striking phenomenon: whether on the plane, in the shopping mall, on the streets, or in the parks... Japanese people can be seen everywhere. The Japanese possess astonishing wealth, and in many countries and regions, they have a formidable presence. It is said that the elderly come here to buy land and villas for retirement; young people come in groups to travel. The yen not only impacts the American market but also the American territory. Years ago, Japan bombed Pearl Harbor, and now it is expanding its economic and living space with the yen.

I also saw some Taiwanese businessmen and tourists. They are all very concerned about the situation on the mainland. In their conversations, they hope that the motherland will be reunified soon. A Taiwanese from Nanjing said: "Don't let it be like this, giving foreigners a laugh." His words express the feelings of the descendants of the Yellow Emperor. He said he would soon return to Nanjing to visit relatives. At the time of writing, he might be strolling under the city walls of Nanjing. The willows by the Xuanwu Lake have just sprouted new leaves, swaying in the wind, welcoming the returning traveler. Some people also want to invest in the country, and I, as a non-official, frequently nodded in welcome.

The prosperity and charm of Hawaii can be said to have been infused with the blood and sweat of our overseas Chinese. This year marks the 200th anniversary of Chinese people residing in Hawaii, and various sectors in Hawaii will celebrate it grandly. Before my departure, I specially wrote a six-character horizontal scroll "Cherish the Source, Uphold the Way," beautifully framed, and entrusted it to a famous overseas Chinese scholar to convey my congratulations. In a Chinese restaurant on Maui Island, I met two middle-aged chefs who had recently been recruited from Beijing and Sichuan. After exchanging greetings, I quickly wrote: "Cook with all your heart, achieve results, bring glory to the motherland, and pride to the Chinese nation!"

Sun Yat-sen once encouraged the people to "catch up and surpass." When will this saying truly be realized?

　　夏威夷情思
    陈玉龙
    新春伊始，受邀参加“东亚书法与社会研讨会”，在夏威夷逗留了七天，留下了美好和深刻的印象。
    按当地风俗，主人给我颈上戴上了花环。休息时一位老妪向我深深一鞠躬，端给我一杯饮料，递给我一盘点心。当我在走廊外散步时，另一位老妪则从小卧车里走出来赠送我一支绿色的圆珠笔，作为纪念……美国朋友就是这样，用鲜花、用饮料、用友谊欢迎东方来客。
    要想了解物质文明和精神文明的辩证关系，夏威夷给我们提供了良好的范例。夏威夷不但空气清新，景色宜人，甚至连人们的心灵也似乎得到净化。夏威夷大学校园就是一座美丽的大花园。就拿我所下榻的林肯楼的四周环境来说，楼后面有著名建筑大师贝聿铭精心设计的富于东方情调的日本式小庭院，小桥流水，曲径通幽，花香鸟语，芳草如茵，让人陶醉。晨昏之际，闲步校园，教师、学生识与不识见了面都亲切地互相道声“您好！”、“早安！”、“晚安！”人们的素质和文化教养于此可见一斑。中国古代大政治家管仲有句名言：“仓廪实而知礼节，衣食足而知荣辱”，在这里得到了印证。
    尽管如此，我并不觉得外国一切都好，“外国的月亮比中国的圆”。相反，我在书写作品赠送华裔同胞时，惯喜题赠“月是故乡明”，以此来牵动海外游子的故国之思。大有大难，小有小难，美国社会自有它的痼疾和弊端。但从整体来看，美国国家的潜力是深厚的，人民是向上进取，充满活力的，社会是在健康发展的。
    夏威夷群岛孤悬美洲大陆之外，原是荒凉不毛之地，如今已建成一座世人艳羡的宝岛。它和本土已经结成血肉般的联系，共同构成锦绣河山。它的开发史对我们今天建设海南和沿海地区不无借鉴之处。
    在夏威夷有一个引人注目的现象，无论是在飞机上，还是在商场里、街道上、公园内……到处都可看到日本人。日本人拥有惊人的财富，在好多国家和地区，有咄咄逼人之势。听说，老年人在这里购置地皮、别墅，养老送终；年青人成群结队来此旅游。日元不仅冲击了美国市场，而且也冲击了美国领土。当年日本用炸弹轰击珍珠港，而今用日元开拓其经济范围和生活领地。
    我还看到一些台湾商人和旅游者。他们都很关心大陆情况。言谈之间，希望祖国早日统一。一位南京出生的台胞说：“不要老是这样子，给外国人看笑话。”他的话吐诉出炎黄子孙的心声。他表示不久就将回南京探亲。笔者执笔时，他可能正在石头城下流连徘徊。想那玄武湖畔的垂柳，刚吐新丝，迎风摇曳，在迎接游子归来吧。有的人还想回国投资，我这非官方人士也频频点头表示欢迎。
    夏威夷的繁华风流，可以说注进了我海外侨胞的多少血和汗。今年是华人旅居夏威夷二百周年纪念，夏威夷各界将大事庆祝。我出发前特地写了“怀其源　振其道”六字横幅，装裱精美，委托华裔著名学者代为转送以示庆贺。我在毛伊岛的一家中餐馆里遇到新近从北京和四川应聘前往掌勺的两位中年厨师。在互相问好后，我挥毫疾书：“精心烹调，做出成绩，为祖国争光，为中华民族争气！”
    孙中山先生曾勉励国人“迎头赶上”，此言何时能真正实现呢？
