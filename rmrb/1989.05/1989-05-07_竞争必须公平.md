Title: Competition Must Be Fair

Competition in China has indeed had a tumultuous history.

Was Chen Duxiu the first to advocate for this idea? Those interested can look into it. In 1915, he wrote a lengthy article in the first issue of *Youth Magazine* promoting the concept. At the time, although he was already a hero of the Xinhai Revolution, he was not arrogant. He titled his article "A Message to Youth." The blood in his words was as fiery as that of a young man: "The survival and evolution of all things depend on the presence and strength of their resistance. The strong prevail over the weak, and this is an inescapable truth."

Unfortunately, this principle later faced much criticism, leading to a long period where Chinese people, upon hearing the word "competition," would immediately envision a scene of "survival of the fittest" and "mutual deception." The root of this aversion, aside from "leftist" ideology, was naturally the "fear of scarcity but not inequality" mindset of the agrarian class. Fortunately, people eventually woke up: in the global competition and development trend, continuing to be "scarce" in this way would mean that even a low level of stability could not be maintained.

Thus, a wave of competition swept across China. Contracting, leasing, mergers, bidding, hiring, and differential elections... the vitality of society gradually became more vibrant.

As competition unfolded, a problem that had long been avoided finally entered our field of vision in a forthright manner: in commodity production, competition, in its essence, is an activity where participants strive to achieve their own interests. Whether it is competition for job opportunities or for success, ultimately, it is competition for interests. For the individuals involved, this inevitably brings emotional and interest conflicts, but the driving force of this interest mechanism is indispensable for the development of the country and the nation.

Of course, the involvement and generalization of interests, in the absence of effective rule constraints, can also lead to various problems. Currently, the public is particularly resentful of two phenomena: one is the use of improper authority to intervene in commodity exchange and competition, seeking excessive profits; the other is the use of counterfeit fraud, tax evasion, and other illegal means to harm the public and amass ill-gotten wealth.

This is not the spirit of a commodity economy; on the contrary, it is a sign of a highly underdeveloped commodity economy. A commodity economy has its own laws and must have order. The most important principle is fair competition. Additionally, it includes keeping contracts, maintaining credibility, and being responsible to consumers, among other things. In places where the commodity economy is relatively developed, these laws and orders have been widely accepted and have become important components of the rule of law. Here, perhaps the establishment of competition rules and the formation of mechanisms still need a process. In this initial stage, "off-track" behaviors are particularly crude and conspicuous. To fundamentally reverse this chaos, we must make great efforts to establish a new order for the commodity economy. What is particularly emphasized at the moment is the aforementioned first principle—promoting fair competition.

Fair competition, first of all, requires equal opportunities. Equal opportunities are established after breaking away from the "equal outcome" mentality of the iron rice bowl. It requires that everyone is equal before the law, rules, and institutions, and that everyone has the right to participate in competition and to protect their own interests. Currently, on one hand, some people in power disregard the constraints of laws or rules and do things that are off-track, and the public dares not question them; on the other hand, some people who want to do things allowed by laws and rules often face prohibitions, making competitors full of ambition but unable to participate. For example, in the economic sphere, some "competitors" with "connections" can easily obtain "economic benefits" through an abnormal channel—a note or a phone call, or even without these, and squeeze out their opponents. This is a common occurrence. In the political sphere, the practice of narrowing the selection circle for officials and excluding the majority of officials and the public is also inconsistent with the principle of fair competition. Such competition is like a 100-meter race where some people crouch at the starting line, while others stand leisurely just one meter away from the finish line. No matter how hard one tries, one can only look at the back of others and sigh. This unequal opportunity situation should be gradually corrected.

The second requirement for fair competition is to follow market principles and implement the survival of the fittest. Currently, the strong often do not win, and the weak are not eliminated, which greatly hinders the enthusiasm for competition. For example, although we have published the *Bankruptcy Law*, many enterprises that are not policy-induced losses but operational losses are still living on subsidies. This money naturally falls on the heads of advanced enterprises. Again, a large number of counterfeit and inferior products often enter the production and sales channels through improper power channels, damaging the reputation of high-quality products and the rights of consumers. Furthermore, some mediocre individuals occupy important positions, no matter how you assess, review, or compete, they remain unscathed, causing a situation in some places and units where "the talented are buried in the ranks" and it is heartbreaking, and so on. The reason for these phenomena is, on one hand, due to the imperfect market mechanism, and the old system still plays a role in protecting the backward to some extent; on the other hand, it is also related to the serious corruption within the party and society. The methods to solve these problems are to deepen the reform, rectify and regulate, accelerate the transformation process of the old and new systems; at the same time, strengthen the construction of the legal system and order, strive to have laws to follow, and plug the loopholes in the legal basis; in addition, improve the supervision mechanism, strengthen the work of public reporting, and further play the role of public opinion criticism. By persistently working in this way, we will definitely be able to rectify the problems in competition, make fair competition the mainstream in society, and thus more quickly promote the modernization of our country.

　　竞争必须公平
    马立诚
    竞争，在中国的命运着实有些坎坷。
    陈独秀算不算最早倡此说的？有兴趣的同志不妨一考。他１９１５年在《青年杂志》开张第一本上曾撰大文鼓吹。其时，他虽已是参加辛亥革命的功臣，却不倨傲，题目就叫《敬告青年》。文中热血更是不让弱冠：“万物之生存进化与否，悉以抵抗力之有无强弱为标准，优胜劣败，理无可逃。”
    不料这公理后来却很遭了些批判，致使很长时期内国人一听竞争，眼前就是一幅“弱肉强食、尔虞我诈”的惨象。这反感的根源，除了“左”的思想，自然是“不患寡而患不均”的农家意识。好在后来终于猛醒：在全球竞争、发展的热潮中，这样“寡”下去，是连低水平的安稳也保不住的。
    于是神州兴起竞争之风。承包、租赁、兼并、招标、考聘、差额选举……社会的活力日渐激扬起来。
    随着竞争的展开，一个过去长期回避的问题终于堂堂正正进入我们的视野：在商品生产中，竞争就其本质来说，是参与者为实现各自利益展开的活动。无论是竞争就业的机会，还是竞争成功的机会，归根到底都是利益的竞争。这对于当事人，虽然不可避免地会带来感情上、利益上的冲击，但这个利益机制的推动作用，对于国家和民族的发展却是必不可少的。
    当然，利益的卷入和泛化，在缺乏有效的规则制约的情况下，也会出现种种弊端。就当前情况而论，群众较为痛恨的是这样两种现象：一是以不正当的权力介入商品交换和竞争，牟取暴利；二是以假冒欺骗、偷税抗税等种种非法手段坑害群众，大发不义之财。
    这并不是商品经济的精神，恰恰相反，倒是商品经济极不发达的表征。商品经济是有自己的法则，也是要有秩序的。首要的一条，就是要公平竞争。其次，还包括要守合同、讲信誉，对消费者负责等等。凡是商品经济比较发达的地方，这些法则和秩序都已为众所认同，并且成为法治的重要内容。我们这里，恐怕竞争规则的建立和机制的形成还需要有一个过程。在这个初始阶段中，“越轨”行为是格外粗野刺目的。要想从根本上扭转这种混乱，只有下大力气建立商品经济新秩序。当前特别要强调的，就是上面所说的头条——开展公平竞争。
    所谓公平竞争，一是要机会均等。机会均等是在打破了“结果平等”的大锅饭意识之后建立起来的新公平观。它要求在法律、规则、制度面前人人平等，任何人都有参与竞争的权利，也都有保护自己利益的权利。现在一方面有些掌权的人不顾法律或规则的约束，干了越轨的事情，群众敢怒而不敢问；另方面，有些人想去做法律和规则允许做的事，往往遭到禁止，致使竞争者空怀壮志无由涉足。譬如在经济领域中，一些有“背景”的“竞争者”，凭着非正常渠道的一张条子或一个电话，甚至连条子电话都不用就能不费吹灰之力获取“经济效益”，挤垮对手，就是屡见不鲜的例子。在政治领域中，把干部选拔的竞争圈子划得小而又小、排斥广大干部和群众的做法，同样不符合公平竞争的原则。这样的竞争，像是百米赛跑中，有些人弓着腰伏在起跑线上，而另一些人却悠闲地站在离终点只有一米的地方。这是无论怎样努力拚搏，也只能望人家的项背而叹的。这种机会不均等的状况应该逐步纠正。
    公平竞争的第二个要求，是要按市场原则，实行优胜劣汰。现在是优的往往胜不了而劣的淘汰不掉，这就极大地妨害了竞争的积极性。比如，我们虽然公布了《破产法》，但相当一批非政策性亏损而是经营亏损的企业还在靠补贴过日子，这笔钱自然要摊到先进企业头上。再如，大批假冒劣质产品往往通过非正当的权力渠道大摇大摆进入生产销售渠道，使优质产品的信誉和消费者的权益受到打击。又如，某些平庸之辈窃居要职，任凭你考核、审查、竞争，他却安然无恙，造成了一些地方和单位“英俊沉于下僚”的令人痛心的状况，等等。之所以产生这些现象，一方面是由于市场机制不健全，旧体制在某种程度上仍在起着保护落后的作用；另一方面也和党内及社会上腐败现象严重有关。解决这些问题的方法，要靠深化改革、治理整顿，加速新旧体制的转型过程；同时，也要加强法制建设、秩序建设，尽量做到有法可依，堵塞法律依据上的漏洞；除此之外，还要完善监督机制，加强群众举报工作，进一步发挥舆论批评的功能。这样坚定不移地努力下去，一定可以整治竞争中的弊端，使公平竞争在社会上成为主导潮流，从而更快地推动我国的现代化建设。
