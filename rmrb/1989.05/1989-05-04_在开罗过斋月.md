This year, the first day of Ramadan in Egypt was April 7th. I had the opportunity to observe Ramadan in Cairo on official business. Every time the sun sets and is about to disappear below the horizon, the bustling city of Cairo suddenly becomes quiet. Occasionally, a car might speed by.

In homes and restaurants, Muslims who have been thirsty and hungry all day quietly gather around the dining table, silently listening to the recitation of the Quran on television and radio. The table is set with drinks and a variety of foods for breaking the fast. On the television screen, a cannon appears, and with a boom, the sound of breaking the fast is heard. People greet each other with "Praise be to God" and "God is great," and then they start eating their iftar meal.

The drinks on the iftar table are not the usual sodas, orange juice, or sparkling water. Instead, they are specially prepared beverages to cool down and quench thirst. The most common ones are "Amelardin," a dark yellow drink made from apricots, which is sour and sweet. There is also "Karkade," similar to our hibiscus tea, which, in addition to being sour and sweet, has the function of cooling down and lowering blood pressure.

According to the Islamic calendar, this year is the 1409th year, and Ramadan is the ninth month, known as "Ramadan." The first day of the first year of the Islamic calendar is July 16, 622 AD, the day when the founder of Islam, Muhammad, led his followers from Mecca to Medina. The Arabic calendar is based on the moon's orbit around the Earth as one month, and twelve orbits as one year. There are no leap years or leap months. Therefore, an Islamic year is about ten days shorter than a Gregorian year. Using the Gregorian calendar to calculate Ramadan, it moves forward by about ten days each year. The formula for calculating the Islamic year using the Gregorian year is:

		(Gregorian year) - 622
	Islamic year = (Gregorian year) - 622 + ────────
		32

This year's Islamic year calculation: 1989 - 622
		1989 - 622
		+ ──────── = 1409
		32

Commercial activities during Ramadan are concentrated in the night markets. Government-run large department stores operate from 8:30 PM to 11:00 PM. Private shops stay open all night. The traditional "Khan el-Khalili" market in Cairo is brightly lit and bustling, attracting many foreign tourists. It can be said that coming to Cairo without visiting "Khan el-Khalili" is a great regret. Here, you can find unique Egyptian trades. Foreign tourists buy Egyptian gold jewelry, silverware, copperware, and local products with ancient Egyptian flavors. Cafes, nightclubs, and clubs are places where ordinary people go. Sometimes the whole family goes out, and sometimes friends gather together, smoking water pipes, enjoying the pleasures of life.

The television programs during Ramadan are rich and varied. This year, the long serial drama "One Thousand and One Nights" was broadcast. The television station also held a prize-guessing contest, with prizes including free overseas travel, televisions, and refrigerators. The guessing contest brought knowledge and joy to countless households.

During Ramadan, each mosque has colorful tents set up outside, and every night, a respected Islamic elder lectures on the teachings of the Quran. The audience is vast. Through a friend's introduction, I attended a lecture on the essence of fasting. The main points were that fasting includes not only abstaining from food, drink, and sexual desires during the day but also physical and spiritual fasting. Physical fasting includes: hand fasting, not stealing from others or harming them; foot fasting, not running errands for bad people or doing bad deeds; tongue fasting, not cursing or lying; ear fasting, not listening to falsehoods or gossip. Spiritual fasting is purifying the mind, not plotting evil, harming others for personal gain, and not envying the talented.

The effect of fasting is to make one kind-hearted and noble-minded, and it is also the duty of every devout Muslim.

### 在开罗过斋月

　　在开罗过斋月
    刘书美
    今年埃及斋月的第一天是四月七日，我有幸因公在开罗过斋月。每当夕阳西斜快要没入地平线的时候，喧嚣了一天的开罗，大街小巷立即寂静无声，偶尔有一辆汽车疾驰而过。
    在家庭、餐馆，口燥唇干，饥肠辘辘了一天的穆斯林们静静地围坐在餐桌旁，默默地听着电视机和收音机里播出悠扬的古兰经诵读声，桌上摆着开斋的饮料和丰富食品。电视机屏幕上出现了一尊礼炮，轰的一声开斋的炮声响了，人们互道“赞美真主”和“真主至大”，端起饮料开始吃开斋饭。
    开斋饭桌上的饮料不是人们日常喝的可乐、桔子汁和汽水等，而是特制的消暑解渴的专门饮料。最普通的有“阿麦尔丁”，这是一种用杏脯制成的暗黄色饮料，酸甜可口。还有一种叫“卡尔卡迪”，相当于我国的玫瑰茄，除酸甜外还有去暑降血压功能。
    按伊斯兰历法今年是第１４０９年，斋月叫“拉马旦月”即伊历九月。伊历纪元元年元旦是公元６２２年７月１６日，是伊斯兰教创始人穆罕默德率信徒从麦加出走麦地那的日子。阿拉伯历法是以月亮绕地球一周为一个月，绕行十二周为一年。没有闰年和闰月。因此，伊历一年比公历一年大约少十天，用公历计算斋月每年都要向前推十天左右，用公历年计算伊历年有一个公式：
                          （公历年）－６２２伊历年＝（公历年）－６２２＋────────
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　３２今年伊历年算法：１９８９－６２２
    　　　　　１９８９－６２２
    　　　　＋─────────＝１４０９年
    　　　　　　　　３２
    斋月的商业活动集中在夜市，公家的国营大百货商店都是晚８∶３０—１１∶００营业。私营商店通宵达旦开业。开罗传统的“哈奈哈利利”市场的夜市灯火辉煌，热闹欢腾，吸引着许许多多外国游客，可以说，来到开罗不去“哈奈哈利利”逛逛真是一大遗憾。这里集中了埃及人与众不同的买卖行当。外国游客们在这里购买埃及的金首饰、银器、铜器和带有古埃及风情的土特产。咖啡馆、夜总会、俱乐部是普通百姓光顾的场所。有的是全家出动，有的亲朋好友聚在一起，吸着“僖吸”水烟袋，享受着人间乐趣。
    斋月的电视节目丰富多彩，今年播出长篇电视连续剧《一千零一夜》。电视台还专门举办有奖猜谜活动，中奖者的奖品有免费出国旅游、彩电、冰箱等。猜谜活动给千家万户带来了知识的光明，生活的乐趣。
    斋月里每个清真寺外面都搭起了色彩鲜艳的布棚，每晚有一位德高望重的伊斯兰长老讲古兰经教义，听讲者如云。经朋友介绍我去听了一次关于封斋真谛的讲座。大意是把斋除白天不吃、不喝、克制性欲外，还包括肢体斋戒和心灵斋戒。肢体斋戒有：手封斋，不偷别人东西、不打人伤人；脚封斋，不为坏人奔走办坏事；舌封斋，不骂人，不说谎；耳封斋，不听妄语和别人背后议论。心灵封斋是净化心灵，不图谋不轨，损人利己，不忌贤妒能。
    把斋的效果是使人心地善良，情操高尚，也是每一位虔诚伊斯兰教徒的义务。
