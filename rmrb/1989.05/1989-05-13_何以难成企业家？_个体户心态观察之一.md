History often plays tricks on people. When the key of reform opens the box of commodity economy, the personal economic motive awakens the earliest, and those who first gain "economic freedom" are the "three teachings and nine flows" who have always lived at the bottom of society.

For many years, their humble status made them never dream of making a fortune. Looking at those stacks of dazzling banknotes, they are indeed a bit at a loss.

Last autumn and winter, the craze for billiards swept through the streets and alleys of Beijing. It was at the billiards table that I met Xia A. In 1983, after Xia A was released from prison, he successively sold candy apples, cigarettes, and fruits. Two years ago, he opened a restaurant and handed it over to a relative from his hometown to manage, while he himself became a "gentleman," riding a motorcycle with his girlfriend, playing billiards, and dining out during the day; at night, he would gamble all night long.

Currently, many individual householders in Beijing have also started to follow Xia A's example, entrusting their business to others to manage while they themselves become non-laboring beneficiaries.

At noon, at the dining table, I asked Xia A, "Aren't you afraid they will scheme behind your back?"

"With them, I implemented a contract responsibility system, paying me 30,000 yuan each year. If they fail to meet the quota, I will rent it out to someone else." Taking advantage of the alcohol, he confided in us. "You ask me why I don't accumulate wealth. To be honest, I have 100,000 yuan in bank deposits alone. I have enough money, so why bother? What's the point of making money? Isn't it for eating well, dressing well, and having fun?"

"Making money is for eating, drinking, and playing. If you don't spend money, you'll regret it when you die." This has become a common saying among some individual householders. Shanghai conducted a survey in 1986 on the spending habits of individual householders, and the order was: purchasing high-end consumer goods, squandering, donating to social welfare, and expanding reproduction, which was at the bottom.

It seems that they still lack the strong urge to accumulate and increase capital.

Of course, there are also some individual operators who, from the bottom of their hearts, look down on short-sighted beneficiaries like Xia A and regard becoming an entrepreneur who has an impact on society as their ideal.

Four years ago, Xia B and his father, Lao B, set up a clothing stall together. After making money, Lao B began to focus on buying things for the home. Last year, during the buying spree, Lao B bought whatever he saw, filling the small home so that there was no place to stand.

However, Xia B, who graduated from high school, had other ideas. He thought it better to let money generate more money than to let it appreciate. He borrowed tens of thousands of yuan from friends, planning to add his family's capital to start a clothing company, and then asked Lao B for permission.

The usually kind Lao B, however, reacted differently. He slammed the table and shouted at Xia B, "You wasteful child! Life is just getting better, and you want to cause trouble!"

Someone said that individual householders make risky money. Xia B said, "We do individual business not because we are braver than others. Given the situation at that time, doing individual business is better than staying at home unemployed or doing odd jobs. To be honest, we make policy money, not risky money."

Recently, we conducted a survey of ten individual vendors at the Water Silicone Market: "If you had a secure 'iron rice bowl' at the beginning, what choice would you have made?" Several of them answered, "We would not have taken the risk of quitting our jobs!"

Because they were not the active choosers of risk and competition at the beginning, but were forced to go into business by the pressure of survival. So, after they made money, the traditional consciousness of "settling down and living a stable life" and avoiding risks and competition reoccupied their minds.

Old C, who sells fruits, told us, "I have never thought about expanding investments; I just want to make a living. To be honest, we all know that we are benefiting from the policy. With my little water and business skills, going to be an entrepreneur is like forcing a duck to climb a tree."

The lack of education and the influence of their early growth environment make it difficult for today's individual householders to break free from the limitations of petty traders. Although they have become independent commodity operators, certain traditional consciousness and habits of petty citizens are unconsciously controlling their actions.

Old D is a workshop owner who prints T-shirts. Initially, the whole family worked together, but after making tens of thousands of yuan, disagreements arose in the family. Old D's opinion was to use all the money to expand production, but his elder sister wanted to distribute the money immediately to buy a piano for her daughter, and his younger brother wanted to buy a motorcycle. His wife was always comparing wealth with a few nearby individual householders, and his fifteen-year-old daughter spent over 300 yuan on a dress.

The idea of increasing investment in Old D's mind only flashed once and never appeared again. Without the urge and desire to expand reproduction, it is impossible to accumulate funds in every possible way, increase investment, and seek rolling development with a rolling snowball spirit.

An economist commented on the current individual householders: "They become petty traders very easily, but due to various limitations from themselves and their surroundings, they find it difficult to develop into entrepreneurs."

### 何以难成企业家？——个体户心态观察之一

　　何以难成企业家？   
    ——个体户心态观察之一
    张锦力　李琦
    历史常常和人们开玩笑，当改革的钥匙打开商品经济的魔盒，个人经济动机最早得到觉醒，最先获得“经济自由”的人们，竟是一直生活在社会“底层”的“三教九流”。
    多年来，卑微的地位，使他们做梦也没想到会发大财。望着那一叠叠眩目的钞票，他们的确有点不知所措了。
    去年秋冬，台球热席卷北京的大街小巷，我和小Ａ就是在台球桌边认识的。一九八三年小Ａ刑满释放后，先后卖过糖葫芦、香烟和水果。前年，他开了一家饭馆，交给乡下来的一位亲戚掌管，他自己却当起“老太爷”，白天，骑上摩托带着女友兜风，打台球，下馆子；晚上则成宿成宿地狂赌。
    目前，北京有许多个体户，也开始像小Ａ一样，把买卖托给别人管理，自己当起不劳而获的食利者。
    中午，在饭桌上，我问小Ａ：“你就不怕他们背后算计你？”
    “我跟他们实行了承包责任制，每年上交我三万元钱，完不成定额，我就租给别人。”趁着酒兴他向我们交了底。“你问我为啥不积累，跟你说句实话，我现在光银行存款就有十万元，钱早够花了，还劳那个神干吗？赚钱为个啥？还不是为了吃好、穿好、玩好。”
    “赚钱就是为了吃喝玩乐，有钱不花，死了后悔。”这已成为一些个体户中的口头禅。上海市一九八六年曾对个体户的金钱投向作过统计，其顺序是购置高档消费品，挥霍乱用，捐赠社会福利，扩大再生产排在最后。
    看来，他们还没有积累资本，增殖资本的强烈冲动。
    当然，也有一些个体经营者，打心眼里就瞧不起小Ａ那样目光短浅的食利者，把做一个对社会有影响的企业家，当成自己的理想。
    四年前，小Ｂ和他父亲老Ｂ一起摆起了一个服装摊。赚了钱，老Ｂ便开始一心一意地往家里置东西。去年抢购风中，老Ｂ见什么买什么，把个小家塞得连落脚的地方都没有。
    而高中毕业的小Ｂ却另有主张，他觉得与其让钱保值，不如让钱生钱。他从朋友那里借贷十几万块钱，打算加上自家的底子准备开办一家服装公司，便向老Ｂ请示。
    一向和蔼的老Ｂ却一反常态。他拍着桌子对小Ｂ吼道：“你这败家子！日子才刚好一点儿，就要折腾！”
    有人说，个体户发的是风险财。小Ｂ却说：“我们干个体并不是因为我们比别人敢冒险，按当时情况，干个体总比在家待业、打杂强。说实在的，我们发的不是风险财，而是政策财。”
    最近，我们对水硅市场十个个体商贩做了这样的调查：“假如你们当初有个保险的‘铁饭碗’，你们会作出怎样的选择呢？”其中有几个回答：“我们不会冒险辞职！”
    因为当初他们就不是风险和竞争的主动选择者，而是受生存逼迫下海。所以当他们发了财之后，“安居乐业，过平稳的小日子”，逃避冒险和竞争的传统意识重新占据他们的心头。
    卖水果的老Ｃ告诉我们：“我从来没有想过什么扩大投资，只是为了混口饭吃。说实在的，咱自个心里也清楚，咱是沾政策光，就咱这点水水，这点经营本事，去当企业家，那不是赶鸭子上架吗？”
    没有文化和当初成长环境的影响，使现今的个体户很难挣脱小商贩的局限。尽管他们已经成为独立的商品经营者，但小市民中的某些传统意识和习惯正在不自觉地支配着他们的行动。
    老Ｄ是个印背心的作坊主。起初，全家合着劲地干，可是挣了几万块钱，家里就产生了分歧。老Ｄ的意见，赚的钱全部用来扩大生产规模，可大妹妹想的是马上分钱，好给女儿买架钢琴，小弟弟则想添置一辆摩托车。老婆整日和附近几家干个体的比阔，十五岁的女儿买一件连衣裙就花掉三百多元。
    增加投资的念头在老Ｄ的脑子也只闪了一下，就再也没有出现。缺少扩大再生产的冲动和欲望，就不可能千方百计积累资金，增加投入，以滚雪球的精神，去求得滚动式的发展。
    有位经济学家这样评价目前的个体户：“他们成为小商贩很容易，但受着自身和周围环境的多种局限，使他们难以发展成为企业家。”
