In the final two events of the 6th World Cup Diving Championships, the swimming stadium of Indiana University in the United States echoed with resounding cheers. These cheers came from over 30 Chinese students studying in the Midwest of the United States. "We came here to cheer for our country's diving team," said Zhū Chū and Sòng Xīnbó, a married couple who are both doctoral students in chemistry at Indiana University.

During the closing ceremony, as the five-star red flag rose again and again to the stirring melody of "March of the Volunteers," Zheng Lián, a doctoral student in physics from Tsinghua University, couldn't help but sing along with the music. Inspired by him, many other students also joined in the singing.

The Chinese athletes did not let down the deep affection of the students studying abroad. When answering a question from an American reporter, Xiong Ní said that the cheers from the Chinese students studying abroad had greatly encouraged him.

　　为祖国健儿呐喊
    第６届世界杯跳水赛的最后２项决赛中，美国印第安纳大学游泳馆内响起了雄壮的呐喊声。这阵阵喊声发自３０多位正在美国中西部留学的中国男女青年。“我们是为祖国跳水队呐喊而来的，”印第安纳大学总校化学博士生诸初和宋新蓓夫妇说。在闭幕式上，当五星红旗在雄壮的《义勇军进行曲》中一次又一次升起时，来自清华大学的物理博士生郑廉不禁随着乐曲放声高歌。在他的带动下，许多留学生也唱了起来。
    中国运动员没有辜负留学生们的一片深情。熊倪在回答美国记者提问时说，中国留学生的呐喊，对他鼓舞很大。
