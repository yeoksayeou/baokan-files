The upgrade and renovation of 11 civil airports in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang have been completed after three years of key construction during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan." A network of modernized airports has basically taken shape across Northeast China.

In China's civil aviation system, the Northeast region has fully leveraged the enthusiasm of both the central and local governments, raising a total of 530 million yuan. New airports have been built in Shenyang (Taoxian), Chaoyang, Yanji, and Mudanjiang, while existing airports in Dalian, Changchun, Qiqihar, Dandong, and Heihe have been expanded. Additionally, technical renovations have been carried out at the airports in Harbin and Jiamusi.
