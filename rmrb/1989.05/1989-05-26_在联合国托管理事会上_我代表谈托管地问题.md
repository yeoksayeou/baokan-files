	China's Representative Discusses Trusteeship Issues

	United Nations, May 25 (People's Daily) -- Correspondent Liu Kai Chen reports: China's Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Yu Mengjia, today expressed at the UN Trusteeship Council meeting that the Chinese delegation will follow the UN Charter to contribute to the completion of the tasks of the international trusteeship system.

	This is the first time China has participated in a Trusteeship Council meeting since it resumed its seat in the United Nations in 1971. Yu Mengjia pointed out in his speech that, according to the provisions of the UN Charter, the main tasks of the international trusteeship system are to promote international peace and security, advance the progress of the residents of the trust territories in political, economic, social, and educational fields, and gradually move towards self-government and independence.

	Yu Mengjia finally hoped that the administering authorities would seriously consider the opinions of the residents of the trust territories, fully fulfill their obligations to the trust territories before the termination of the trusteeship agreements, meet the wishes of the people of the trust territories, and create the necessary conditions for them to achieve self-determination and independent development.

　　在联合国托管理事会上
    我代表谈托管地问题
    本报联合国５月２５日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国副代表俞孟嘉大使今天在联合国托管理事会会议上表示，中国代表团将遵照联合国宪章为完成国际托管制度的任务而作出贡献。
    这是中国自１９７１年恢复在联合国席位后首次参加托管理事会会议。俞孟嘉在发言中指出，按照联合国宪章规定，国际托管制度的主要任务是，促进国际和平与安全，推动托管领土居民在政治、经济、社会和教育等领域的进步，并逐步向自治和独立发展。
    俞孟嘉最后希望托管当局认真考虑托管领土居民的意见，在结束托管协议前，完全履行对托管领土所需承担的义务，满足托管地人民的愿望，为他们实现自决和独立发展创造必要的条件。
