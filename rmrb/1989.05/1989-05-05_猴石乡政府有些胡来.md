Title: The Government of Hou Shi Township is Acting Arbitrarily

Since last autumn, the township government has ordered farmers to dig pits in fertile fields to plant 7,000 mu of hawthorns, apples, and pears. Assuming a yield of 400 kilograms of grain per mu, our township will produce 2.8 million kilograms less grain each year. Farmers have many complaints about this, but anyone who does not follow the township government's regulations will be fined. Farmers have no choice but to reluctantly dig the pits for the trees.

This spring, the township government again forced farmers to plant tobacco. Since farmers have no experience in planting tobacco and the land is not suitable for it, farmers are confused. However, the township government has held meetings multiple times to "mobilize" the farmers, claiming to respect the farmers' autonomy, but in reality, any household that does not plant tobacco will be fined 200 yuan. Some farmers who do not pay the fine have the amount deducted from their grain sales earnings by the township.

The township government spent over 200,000 yuan to purchase large buses and small cars, with most of the purchase cost borne by the farmers. In 1988, my village alone had a per capita burden of 70 yuan. Last autumn, after the township government bought the large bus, they held a grand banquet to celebrate, inviting leaders from the county's direct-affiliated departments, leaders from more than 20 townships and towns in the county, and the secretaries and chairpersons of the 12 village committees in our township, along with their spouses. They also gave gifts of cloth to relevant personnel. This is truly arbitrary behavior.

### 猴石乡政府有些胡来

　　猴石乡政府有些胡来
    去年秋季以来，我乡政府让农民在良田里挖坑栽山楂和苹果、梨７０００多亩。按亩产粮４００公斤计算，我乡每年将少产粮２８０万公斤。对此，农民意见纷纷，但谁不执行乡政府的规定，就得被罚款。农民只好违心地挖树坑。
    今年春天，乡政府又强迫农民种烟，由于农民根本没有种烟的经验，加上土地不适合种，因此农民想不通。但乡政府五次三番开会“动员”，名义上尊重农民自主权，实际上谁家不种烟，就罚款２００元钱。有的农民不交罚款，乡里从农民的卖粮款中扣除。
    乡政府花２０多万元购买大客车和小汽车，买车款大部分由农民负担，我村在１９８８年人均负担７０元。去年秋天，乡政府将大客车买回来以后，就大摆宴席以示庆贺，邀请了县直属部门领导人、全县２０多个乡、镇领导同志和我乡１２个村支部书记、村委会主任及其夫人；还向有关人员赠送了衣料。这岂不是有些胡来。
