Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 8th.

Today in the afternoon, officials from the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council responded to four students who submitted a "petition" requesting dialogue. They announced that leaders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council will engage in broad dialogue with workers, peasants, intellectuals, students, teachers, and non-Party personnel.

On May 6th, these four students submitted a petition signed by 24 universities in Beijing to the Communist Party of China Central Committee, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and the State Council. Today in the afternoon, they went to the reception room of the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council to listen to the response.

According to reports, the students' petition on May 6th requested "a sincere and constructive public dialogue on the current student patriotic democratic movement, deepening political and economic system reforms, and promoting the development of democracy and the rule of law."

Officials from the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council stated that in recent periods, leaders from the State Council and Beijing Municipality have already engaged in dialogue with some students. Some ministers have also visited schools, student dormitories, or offices, or invited students to their department offices for dialogue. The effect of these dialogues has been relatively good. In the future, they will continue to engage in multi-level and multi-channel dialogues with college students.

The official said that to better engage in dialogue with students, they will continue to request various schools and the Beijing Municipal Students' Union to collect students' requests for dialogue and opinions on how to improve the dialogue.

The official from the National People's Congress Standing Committee Information Office, on behalf of the leadership, stated that the leaders of the National People's Congress Standing Committee welcome dialogue with students and relevant personnel.
