The Shenyang Smelting Plant has turned its predicament into an opportunity, transforming despair into hope. During the rectification period, the plant has built itself into an externally-oriented enterprise, resolving the "three-source" (energy, finance, and mineral) crisis. From January to April, its profits and taxes increased by 23.37% compared to the same period last year.

This year, the Shenyang Smelting Plant faced three major difficulties: severe shortage of funds, lack of raw materials, and tight energy supply. General Manager Huang Yongjing and his team saw these as both challenges and opportunities. They decided to leverage foreign capital and resources to engage in processing trade, exporting products back to foreign markets, and transforming the enterprise from an "inward-looking" to an "outward-looking" model, using others' "legs" to make their own "rope."

Based on extensive investigations, the Shenyang Smelting Plant developed a three-tiered strategy to build an externally-oriented enterprise:

1. Borrowing money to buy ore. With the guarantee of the Shenyang municipal government, the plant borrowed over $10 million and signed processing trade agreements with the United States, Canada, and Mexico, ensuring a stable supply of raw materials for the next five years.

2. Establishing mines abroad. Australia has rich copper and lead resources. The Shenyang Smelting Plant, in collaboration with relevant foreign investors, established the Pacific Mining Development Company to jointly develop mines, fundamentally solving the problems of insufficient funds and ore supply.

3. Building smelting plants abroad. To achieve better economic benefits, the plant also signed agreements with Australia and New Zealand to build a nickel smelting plant in New Zealand. This leverages local abundant resources, exports technology and labor services, and earns more foreign exchange for the country.

In the process of transforming from an "inward-looking" to an "outward-looking" enterprise, the Shenyang Smelting Plant has undergone several positive changes. Equipment and technology have been updated, product quality has significantly improved, and export delivery times have been advanced.

　　借钱购买矿石　出国办矿办厂    
    治理整顿中另辟蹊径  沈阳冶炼厂外向发展
    本报讯  记者段心强报道：把困境当成机遇，使绝望变为希望——沈阳冶炼厂在“整治”中建成外向型企业，使“三源（能、财、矿）”危机得到解决。１至４月，利税比去年同期增加２３．３７％。
    今年，沈阳冶炼厂遇到三大困难：资金奇缺；原料无源；能源紧张。厂长黄永敬和助手认为，这是困境，也是机遇。趁机到国外利用人家的资金和资源，搞来料加工，把产品返销到国外，把企业由“内向型”建成“外向型”，借人家的“腿”搓自己的“绳”。
    沈阳冶炼厂在广泛调查的基础上，分３个层次建设外向型企业：一、借钱买矿石。由沈阳市政府担保，借款１０００多万美元，与美国、加拿大、墨西哥签订了来料加工的协议，５年之内的原料供给有了保证。二、在国外办矿。澳大利亚有铜矿、铅矿资源，沈阳冶炼厂和有关外商建立太平洋有限矿业开发公司，联合办矿，从根本上解决了资金和矿石不足的问题。三、在国外建冶炼厂。为了取得更好的经济效益，他们还和澳大利亚、新西兰签定了协议，在新西兰建一个镍冶炼厂，利用当地的丰富资源，输出技术和劳务，为国家赢得更多的外汇。
    在由“内向型”改为“外向型”的过程中，沈阳冶炼厂发生一系列可喜变化。设备和工艺得到更新，产品质量显著提高，出口交货时间也提前了。
