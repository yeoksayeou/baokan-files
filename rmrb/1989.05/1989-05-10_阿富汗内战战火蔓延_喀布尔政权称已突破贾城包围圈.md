Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, May 10th.

The civil war in Afghanistan has intensified, with fierce fighting in Jalalabad since the start of the Eid al-Fitr holiday on May 7th. With strong artillery and air support, the government forces launched a counterattack.

The Kabul regime's spokesman announced on the 9th that after two months of intense fighting, the government forces have broken through the Mujahideen's siege of Jalalabad from the north and east lines.

The Mujahideen acknowledged the government forces' counterattack but claimed to have repelled it and inflicted heavy casualties on the government forces, with over 150 government soldiers killed and 27 militiamen surrendering to the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen also shot down a Kabul military aircraft using Stinger missiles and ambushed a government supply convoy on the Kabul-Jalalabad highway, killing, wounding, and capturing over 40 government soldiers, and destroying two tanks and two military vehicles.

In the Hosta battlefield, the Mujahideen and government forces have been engaged in intense fighting for several days. North of Hosta City, the Mujahideen inflicted heavy losses on the government's 59th Division.

In the Kabul battlefield, both sides are engaged in direct confrontations over control of the Salang Highway. The government forces have deployed aircraft to bomb Mujahideen positions and continue to launch "Scud" missiles at Mujahideen strongholds.

In Kandahar, the government forces have conducted multiple airstrikes against the Mujahideen. The Mujahideen have frequently launched rocket attacks on Kandahar Airport in an attempt to blockade the airport.

　　阿富汗内战战火蔓延    
    喀布尔政权称已突破贾城包围圈
    本报伊斯兰堡５月１０日电  记者任毓骏报道：５月７日开斋节以来，贾拉拉巴德战火异常激烈。在强大的炮火和空中力量支援下，政府军守军发动了反击。
    喀布尔政权发言人９日称，经过两个月激战，政府军已从北线和东线突破游击队对贾拉拉巴德的包围。
    游击队方面承认政府军曾发起反攻，并声称击退了这次反攻并重创政府军，有１５０多名政府军被打死，２７名民兵向游击队投诚。游击队使用毒刺导弹打下喀布尔军１架飞机，在喀布尔—贾拉拉巴德公路上伏击了政府军的运输队，打死打伤和俘虏政府军４０余人，击毁坦克、军车各２辆。
    在霍斯特战场，连日来游击队和政府军激战不止。在霍斯特城北，游击队重创了政府军守军第５９旅。
    在喀布尔战场，双方正面冲突仍是争夺萨朗公路的控制权。政府军出动飞机轰炸游击队据点，继续向游击队阵地发射地对地“飞毛腿”式导弹。
    在坎大哈，政府军向游击队方面多次发起空中轰炸。游击队也频频向坎大哈机场发射火箭，力图封锁这个机场。
