The miner Hu Changshu from the Shizi Mountain Copper Mine of Anhui Copper Company has completed 15 years and 5 months of work in just 7 years. Currently, he is about to complete the production tasks for the year 2001.

This 53-year-old Communist Party member is known as "the man who walks ahead of time." The mine sets the annual task for deep hole drilling workers at 1,000 meters, but Hu Changshu has completed over 18,000 meters of deep hole drilling from July 1982 to April of this year, averaging more than one and a half times the annual production task. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation have respectively awarded him the national "May 1st Labor Medal" and the title of "Pioneer of Mining."

　　矿工胡长树提前跨世纪
    新华社合肥电  （通讯员刘其鹿、记者王礼贶）安徽铜陵有色金属公司狮子山铜矿打眼工胡长树，７年干了１５年零５个月的活。目前他即将完成２００１年的生产任务。
    这位５３岁的共产党员被誉为“走在时间前面的人”。铜矿规定打眼工一年的深孔进尺任务是１０００米，而胡长树自１９８２年７月到今年４月，已完成深孔进尺１．８万多米，平均每年超额完成生产任务一倍半以上。全国总工会和中国有色金属工业总公司分别授予他全国“五一”劳动奖章和“开矿功臣”称号。
