Recently, scientists from China and France discovered a unique scenic area about twenty kilometers east of the city of Luodian County in Guizhou Province. The experts from both countries have dubbed it the "Eastern Cave Museum."

This unique scenic area features three interconnected cave tunnels underground, stretching approximately five kilometers. Within these tunnels, there are magnificent caverns adorned with stalactites and stalagmites, as well as deep, clear underground lakes. Two streams of clear water converge to form an underground river, with a flow rate of thirty to forty cubic meters per second. The surface of the scenic area is covered with lush, green mountains, offering a breathtaking view. French experts believe that this scenic area can rival the Vaucluse Springs in southern France.

　　贵州发现奇特景区
    本报贵阳电  最近，中法两国科学家在贵州省罗甸县城东二十多公里处发现一奇特风景区，两国专家称之为“东方洞穴博物馆”。
    这一奇特风景区，地下有三个虹吸管状的洞穴相连，长约五公里。其间有瑰丽多姿的钟乳石洞厅，幽深清澈的地下湖泊。两股清泉涌出汇成暗河，流量每秒三十至四十米。风景区地面山峦叠翠，风光秀丽，令人神往。法国专家认为，此风景区可与法国南部的伏克留兹泉相媲美。
