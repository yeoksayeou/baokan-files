Universities Admit Recommended Students: Jilin Implements Four Opens

The plan for Jilin Province to admit recommended students to ordinary universities this year has been issued to various regions. To prevent interference from improper practices, the plan does not leave any flexible quotas, and no university or middle school is allowed to admit or recommend students outside the plan.

This year, the province has decided to implement "four opens" for admitting recommended students: the conditions, quotas, and list of recommended students will be made public within the school; the results of admitting recommended students will be made public to society to facilitate public supervision.

To prevent violations in the recommendation process, Jilin Province has made specific regulations for handling violations: students, their parents, and their agents are not allowed to give notes, make requests, or offer gifts to the personnel in charge of recommendations, engaging in nepotism. Those who violate this will have their recommended student status and admission eligibility revoked. If the parents or agents are in-service personnel, they will be given an administrative demotion or higher. Middle schools are not allowed to fabricate information. If they recommend students who do not meet the conditions, they will be given a demotion or even dismissed from public office, depending on the severity of the error. University admissions personnel and provincial admissions office staff, if they have violated the recommendation regulations, will also be held accountable and given administrative penalties.

　　高校招收保送生
    吉林实行四公开
    新华社长春５月２９日电  （记者陈美凤）吉林省今年普通高校招收保送生的计划已下达到各地区。为了防止不正之风的干扰，计划不留机动指标，任何高校和中学不准在计划外招收和保送学生。
    今年招收保送生，省内决定实行“四公开”：即在校内公开保送生条件、保送生指标和保送生名单；向社会公开录取保送结果，以便于群众监督。
    为了防止保送工作出现违纪行为，吉林省对违纪处理作了具体规定：学生、家长及其代理人，不得向负责保送的工作人员递条子，打招呼，送财物，营私舞弊。违反者，取消保送生资格和入学资格。家长及代理人是在职人员的，要给予行政记大过以上的处分。中学不准弄虚作假，如保送不符合条件的考生，要视错误情节，给予记大过直至开除公职处分。高校招生人员和省招生机构工作人员，如有违反保送规定的行为，也要追究有关人员的责任，给予行政处分。
