The PLO Executive Committee issued a statement today in Tunis, declaring that the election plan approved by the Israeli cabinet is merely a farce aimed at deceiving international opinion and strengthening Israel's occupation of Arab territories.

The statement said that the plan proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Shamir is flawed because it does not include the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the occupied territories. It is merely a plan intended for Jordan's ears, ignoring the fact that the PLO is the representative of the Palestinian people.

The statement also criticized the plan for disregarding the Palestinians' right to establish an independent homeland.

The statement emphasized that the PLO's representation of the Palestinian people and its legitimacy in establishing an independent Palestinian state cannot be ignored.

The Israeli cabinet on May 14 approved Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip with 20 votes in favor and 6 against.

　　巴解组织执委会声明  拒绝沙米尔选举计划
    新华社突尼斯５月１５日电  巴勒斯坦解放组织执行委员会今天在这里发表声明认为，以色列内阁通过的选举计划只不过是一场欺骗世界舆论和加强以色列对阿拉伯领土占领的闹剧。
    声明说，以色列总理沙米尔提出的这项计划是有缺陷的，因为这项计划不包括以色列撤离被占领土。这仅仅是说给约旦听的一项计划，无视巴解组织是巴勒斯坦人民的代表。
    声明还抨击这项计划还置之不理巴勒斯坦人建立独立家园的权利。
    声明强调，巴解组织代表巴勒斯坦人民和建立巴勒斯坦独立国的合法性不容忽视。
    以色列内阁１４日以２０票赞成，６票反对通过了沙米尔提出的在被占领的约旦河西岸和加沙地带举行选举的建议。
