Title: Breaking the Mold

While reading the newspaper, I came across a report that a relatively young scholar from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had been promoted to a senior professional title in an exceptional manner. A major newspaper covered this news extensively, almost as if it were a significant event, which left me somewhat puzzled. Every time I see the term "exceptional," I can't help but wonder, what exactly is being "broken" here?

From the report, it seems there are two main points. The first is the issue of academic qualifications. The report mentioned that the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had "exceptionally promoted a young scholar who had not completed higher education and had achieved success through self-study to a senior professional title, which is unprecedented." In an era where the slogans of respecting knowledge and respecting talent are louder than ever, it is understandable to emphasize academic qualifications when evaluating professional titles. However, this is not entirely the case. I think, the first professor or the first researcher in the world, if not self-proclaimed, must have been given the title by someone without a title. Later, with the invention of strict degree systems and professional title evaluation systems, everything must be done according to the rules. Those without academic qualifications cannot "enter the hall" or "enter the room," and even after entering the room, they must climb step by step. This way, it is inevitable that some truly talented individuals will be excluded and will not receive the professional titles they deserve. Fortunately, this scholar has his translated works of tens of thousands of words, and fortunately, there are a group of well-known scholars with keen eyes who can recognize talent and do not adhere to a single standard. With both subjective and objective conditions met, the promotion was successfully completed. However, upon closer examination, according to the principle of seeking truth from facts, giving a professional title based on one's level is a natural and reasonable thing to do. What is there to "break"?

The second point is the issue of age. The person who was exceptionally promoted is 39 years old this year, approaching the age of 40. Without discussing the situation in foreign countries, among the older generation of intellectuals in our country, there are many who became professors in their early 30s. Theoretically, the new society should be better than the old society. However, Hu Shi and Qian Zhongshu both became professors at the age of 28. In comparison, this lucky individual is still only an associate professor, which is not considered young. However, given the current state of our country's initial stage of development, the debt is indeed too great. In the past, labeling someone as a rightist had a quota, implementing family planning had a quota, and now evaluating senior professional titles also has a quota. Therefore, compared to his peers or even older generations, he is indeed much luckier. For example, in the reportage "National Mourning," it is mentioned that Xia Qun from the Agricultural University, a disciple and assistant of the entomology expert Zhou Mingzhang, was the principal and participant of a national agricultural science and technology key project. He had trained many doctoral and master's students, but when he died of a heart attack at the age of 53, he was still just an "old lecturer." Forty-eight faculty members of the Agricultural University signed a petition to the school leadership, demanding a re-evaluation of his associate researcher title, but this request was like a stone sinking into the sea, with no response.

Age in our country is also a rather peculiar reference number. Sometimes it appreciates, sometimes it depreciates. When promoting cadres with an emphasis on youth, if one exceeds a certain "critical line," even if one is in good health and has both virtue and talent, one will still be screened out. However, when evaluating senior professional titles, if one has not endured to the point of blurred vision, gray hair, and shaking teeth, it is very difficult to obtain this "honor." A female colleague in a certain unit who was evaluated as a professor-level title was hired for less than two years when a retirement notice was placed in front of her, making her feel sad and tearful. The reason was that she had reached the retirement age of 55 and had to suffer the pain of being "cut off." Of course, after being "cut off," she can still be "re-hired" and continue to contribute. But the "effective period" of this senior professional title is too short! And those in official positions are different. In the same unit as the above situation, a female colleague holding a deputy bureau-level administrative position can have her retirement age extended. If she has any titles such as a member of the National People's Congress or a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the retirement age can be extended even further. This shows the importance placed on official positions over professional titles!

In summary, I personally think that the "exceptional" promotion of this person who is called "exceptional" is not really exceptional. But breaking the mold is better than not breaking it, and the more breaks there are, the longer the usage period, the better it is for both the individual and the country. This is just a small consolation.

　　破格辨
    惠风
    读报偶闻社科院一位较年轻的学者被破格晋升高级职称的消息。某大报是以较大的篇幅作为一大喜讯来报道，不免有点困惑。每每看到“破格”二字就想问，究竟“破”在哪里呢？
    试从报道中分析，大概有两条。其一是学历问题。报道中说社科院“破格晋升没有完成高等学历、自学成才的年轻学者，取得高级职称，这还是没有前例的”。在尊重知识、尊重人才的口号喊得比以往任何时候都响亮的现在，在评定职称时，注重学历，固无可厚非，但又不尽然。窃思，世界上第一位教授、第一位研究员，如果不是自封的，便是没有职称的人授予的，以后发明了严格的学位制、职称评定制，就得照章办事了。没有学历的不得“登堂、入室”，入室之后还要一级一级往上爬，这样就难免将一些具有真才实学的人拒之于门外，得不到应有的职称，幸而这位学者有他的数万字译著在，又幸而有一批知名度高的学者慧眼识英雄，能够做到“不拘一格降人才”，主客观条件具备，才得以顺利过关。但细一琢磨，按照实事求是的原则，够什么水平，就给什么职称，是顺理成章，应有之义，何“破”之有？
    其二，年龄问题。被破格提拔者，今年三十有九，年近不惑。且不论外国异邦的情况，我国老一代知识分子中，３０岁刚出头就当教授的，大有人在，按说新社会优越于旧社会，可是胡适、钱钟书都在２８岁便当上了教授，两相比较，该幸运儿还只是副教授这一档，也算不得年轻了。然而，按照我国初级阶段的现状，欠账实在太多，以前划右派有百分比，实行计划生育有百分比，现在评定高级职称当然也有百分比。因此，他比起同龄人或更年长的一辈人来，毕竟要幸运得多了。随举一例，报告文学《国殇》中提到的农大谢以铨，乃昆虫学专家周明牂的得意门生和助手，是国家农业科技攻关项目的主持人和参加者，曾培养出不少博士、硕士研究生，可是当他５３岁猝死于心脏病时，仍是个“老讲师”。农大４８名教职人员为死者鸣不平，联名上书学校领导，要求重新审议他的副研究员的职称，但这一请愿如石沉大海，杳无音信。
    年龄，在我国也是一个颇为奇妙的参照系数。忽而升值，忽而贬值。在提拔干部强调年轻化时，如超越某一“临界线”，即使体魄健壮，德才兼备，也不得不被筛选在外。可是，在评定高级职称时，若非熬到视茫茫、发苍苍，齿髓动摇的地步，又很难获得这一“殊荣”。某单位一个被评上教授级职称的女同志，受聘不到两年，一张退休表便摆到了她的面前，不禁使她黯然神伤，潸然泪下，原因是踩上了“５５”退休年龄线，不得不挨“一刀切”之苦。当然“切”下来之后，还可以被“返聘”，还可以发挥余热。但这个高级职称的“正式有效期”未免过于短促了！而当官的又当别论，与上述情况同一单位的担任司局级行政职务的女同志，则离退休年龄可放宽，如有什么人大、政协委员头衔的，还可再放宽，重官轻仕，可见一斑！
    总之，窃以为这位被称为破格者的“破格”实在算不得什么。但破总比不破好，破得越多，使用期越长，于己于国都越有利，这也只不过是聊堪自慰而已。
