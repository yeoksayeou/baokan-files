Among the "Fifth Generation" directors who emerged simultaneously but are less renowned, one is Wu Ziniu. He is diligent, serious, and meticulous. Over the past few years, he has directed seven films. He is not lacking in individuality and talent. While his peers were enthusiastic about "intentional aesthetics," making films like "Yellow Earth" and "Red Sorghum" that caught the world's attention, he took a different path, focusing on realism blended with expressionism, emphasizing movement, and pursuing depth and intensity. Recently, his film "Evening Bell" won the "Silver Bear" award at the Berlin Film Festival, which can be seen as a small consolation for his "loneliness."

"Heroes of Joy" and "Yin and Yang World" are companion pieces and can be viewed as a single film. The film is adapted from the late writer and diplomat Si Ma Wensen's novel "Wind and Rain in Tongjiang." The screenwriter is Si Ma Wensen's daughter, Si Ma Xiaojia, who is also Wu Ziniu's wife. "Wind and Rain in Tongjiang" was published in the early 1960s, but in that era of "class struggle as the key link," it did not receive the recognition it deserved. The author was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution.

What is commendable is the creativity of the director and screenwriter. Wu Ziniu said: "After reading the literary script, I faced the suffering of my predecessors with a heavy heart. Due to the half-century gap, I also view the disasters our nation has experienced with a philosophical attitude."

Based on this understanding, the director and screenwriter infused the film with a great sense of reality, humanity, and life consciousness. The theme of "Heroes of Joy" may lie here. Although almost everything that happens is tragic, under specific conditions, they struggle and fight. As individuals, their lives have all shone with light and warmth, making them "heroes" who pursue joy. Because they have sincerely loved, hated, and lived, they have not lived in vain in this world of suffering.

Here, the film has effectively changed the traditional perspective. Historical themes, known for their "revolutionary utilitarianism," have been surpassed by a new aesthetic consciousness. Layers of life and characters that were previously limited by ideology have finally been presented with rare realism and richness. The Communist Party member Cai Laoliu in the film is first and foremost presented as a human figure. His death is not in a direct confrontation with the enemy but due to his father's vile desires and bad habits. The conflict between Shangshangmu and Xiaxiaomu is not just a class struggle but a concentration of historical, clan, ethical, and real-life interests and conflicts. There is no individual protagonist; the "main character" is given back to the people, and reality is given back to "history."

At the same time, we see that Wu Ziniu has paid attention to the weaknesses of the "Fifth Generation" in ignoring storylines and character development. The plot of "Heroes of Joy" is very complex and intricate. It revolves around the clan fights between Shangshangmu and Xiaxiaomu, and the Wu and Xu clans, weaving together the conflicts and struggles of the three factions of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The fates of more than a dozen main characters are intertwined yet distinct. There are political struggles, clan fights, love, intrigue, violence, and death. The plot development has both "necessity" and mysterious, unpredictable chance. Many critics have called it a "masterpiece" and a "path to creating great works," which is quite reasonable.

　　吴子牛与《欢乐英雄》
    彭加瑾
    在“第五代”导演中，同时崛起，而声名不那么显赫的人中，有一个就是吴子牛。他勤奋、严肃、认真，几年来拍了七部影片。他不乏个性与才华，在同伴们热衷于“意向美学”，以《黄土地》、《红高粱》令世人瞩目之际，他却独辟蹊径，走着纪实性融汇表现性、强化运动感、追求深度与力度的道路。不久前，他的《晚钟》获西柏林电影节“银熊奖”，也算是对他的“寂寞”给予的一点报偿。
    《欢乐英雄》、《阴阳界》为上下姐妹篇，可当作一部影片来看。影片是根据已故作家、外交家司马文森的长篇小说《风雨桐江》改编的。编剧是司马文森之女司马小加，也是吴子牛的爱人。《风雨桐江》发表于六十年代初期，在那“以阶级斗争为纲”的年代里，没有得到应有的评价；作者在“文革”中被迫害至死。
    可贵的是编导的创造性。吴子牛说：“读了文学剧本以后，我以一种沉痛的心情面对父辈的苦难。由于有半个多世纪的间隔距离，我也以一种达观的态度看待我们民族经历过的灾难。”
    基于这种认识，编导赋予影片以巨大的真实感、人性意识和生命意识。《欢乐英雄》的命题，涵义也许就在这里。尽管这里发生的几乎全是悲剧，但在特定的条件下，他们拚搏、奋斗，作为个体的生命，都曾焕发出光与热，都是追求欢乐的“英雄”。因为他们真诚地爱过，恨过，生活过，并没有在苦难的人间白活一场。
    在这里，影片事实上已经变换了传统的视角。以“革命功利主义”见称的历史题材，为一种新的审美意识所超越。以往由于思想局限而未能得到表现的人物与生活层面，终于以少有的真实性与丰富性表现出来。影片中的共产党员蔡老六，首先是作为一个人的形象出现在我们跟前的。他的死不在敌我的正面交锋，而是因为父亲卑劣的欲念与恶习。上上木与下下木的冲突，也不仅仅是阶级斗争，而是凝聚了历史、宗族、伦理、现实利益的矛盾与冲突。这里没有个体的主人公，展示的也不是过多提纯过滤的历史。它把“主角”还给了人民；把真实还给了“历史”。
    同时，我们也看到：吴子牛注意到了“第五代”忽视故事与人物形象刻画的弱点。《欢乐英雄》的故事十分复杂曲折。它以上上木、下下木，吴、许宗族械斗为主线，集结了国共两党、吴许两族三派的矛盾冲突；十几位主要人物的命运相互纠结而又大异其趣。其中有政治斗争、宗族械斗、爱情、阴谋、暴力、死亡，情节的发展既有着“必然性”，又有着神秘莫测的偶然性。不少评论家称之为“大手笔”，“出大作品的路子”，是有道理的。
