The restoration project of the former residence of renowned writer Shen Congwen has recently been completed in his hometown of Fenghuang County in western Hunan.

The residence is located in the town of Tuojiang, surrounded by mountains and rivers. It is a traditional courtyard-style wooden structure with green tiles and brown lacquer, simple yet elegant. Before the restoration, the residence had been neglected for many years, with broken doors and windows and uneven floors. Early last year, Fenghuang County sent representatives to Beijing to discuss the restoration of Shen's former residence with him. Despite being bedridden due to illness, Shen Congwen firmly opposed the idea, saying, "The hometown is still very poor, and we should not waste the country's money!" In May of last year, Shen passed away. The Fenghuang County People's Government immediately allocated more than 200,000 yuan for the restoration of Shen's former residence.

It is reported that after the restoration, Shen Congwen's former residence will be converted into the Shen Congwen Memorial Hall.

　　沈从文故居在凤凰县修复
    本报讯  著名作家沈从文故居修复工程最近在他的故乡湘西凤凰县城全部竣工。
    故居坐落在山环水绕的沱江镇，是四合院式的木质结构，青瓦棕漆，简节明快，典雅大方。修复前，故居已多年失修，门窗破烂不堪，地面坑洼不平。去年初，凤凰县曾派人赴北京与沈先生商谈其故居修复事宜，正处病中卧床不起的沈从文先生却坚决不同意，他说：“家乡还很穷，不要乱花国家的钱！”去年５月，沈先生不幸病逝，凤凰县人民政府立即拨出专款２万余元着手修复沈老故居。
    据悉，修复后沈从文故居将改为沈从文纪念馆。
