	For Young Writers to Become Scholars, Opportunities Are Created
	The Opening Ceremony of the Graduate Class at Lu Xun Literary Institute

A group of young writers who are well-known in the literary circles, such as Mo Yan, Liu Yiran, Xiao Yinan, Ye Wenfu, and Yan Songqing, will begin their two-year study. Today, Lu Xun Literary Institute held an opening ceremony for these literary elites.

This class of graduate students in arts and literature, and literary creation is jointly organized by the Graduate School of Beijing Normal University, the Chinese Writers Association, and Lu Xun Literary Institute, with a total of 51 students enrolled.

At today's opening ceremony, literary critic Chen Huangmei hoped that young writers would dare to explore and innovate, creating new paths for Chinese literature. He believed that socialist literature should take on the responsibility of cultivating a new generation, and should regard improving the overall scientific, cultural, and moral standards of society as its mission. To fulfill this mission, young writers should carry forward the spirit of Lu Xun's "pragmatic approach," enriching their theoretical arsenal.

The purpose of holding this graduate class for young writers is to open up avenues and create conditions for young writers to become scholars.

　　为青年作家学者化创造条件    
    鲁迅文学院研究生班开学
    新华社北京５月８日电  （实习生朱国圣）一批在文坛上知名度较高的青年作家如莫言、刘毅然、肖亦农、叶文福、严歌苓等，将开始为期两年的学习生活。今天，鲁迅文学院为这批文坛骄子举行了开学典礼。
    这届文艺学、文学创作研究生班由北京师范大学研究生院、中国作家协会和鲁迅文学院共同举办，共招生５１人。
    在今天的开学典礼上，文艺评论家陈荒煤希望青年作家们勇于探索和创新，开创中国文学的新道路。他认为，社会主义文学应该担负起培养新一代人的责任，应该把提高整个社会的科学文化素质和道德水准作为职责。为着这一使命，青年作家应该发扬鲁迅的“拿来主义”精神，充实自己的思想理论仓库。
    举办这届青年作家研究生班，其目的是为青年作家学者化开辟途径和创造条件。
