Self-criticism is one of the distinctive features that sets the Communist Party of China apart from other political parties. I would like to share some thoughts on this topic.

First, it is important to note that self-criticism has no negative connotations; rather, it is an active, progressive, and realistic approach. Self-criticism is not merely self-condemnation. It is a genuine, dialectical materialist self-awareness that must be based on an objective assessment of reality. To achieve this, one must examine and analyze the right and wrong, merits and demerits, as well as the experiences and lessons learned from one's actual life. Based on this, one should conduct a self-summary, analyze both subjective and objective factors, and then propose plans and measures for improvement. Serious self-criticism should aim to closely integrate cognition and practice, demonstrating self-improvement and advancement through concrete actions. In this way, self-awareness develops into self-practice, followed by further practice and self-criticism, creating a continuous cycle of progress.

Currently, emphasizing the improvement and strengthening of ideological and political work, and clarifying the role and significance of self-criticism in this process, is of great importance. Conducting ideological and political work involves two aspects: the organizers and implementers of the work, and the objects of the work. Both are indispensable for self-criticism. The effectiveness of ideological and political work depends on whether the recipients, the objects of the work, have resolved their ideological issues and have been motivated to act consciously, actively, and practically. Therefore, ideological and political work should be focused on the recipients' self-awareness, self-criticism, and self-improvement. For the organizers and implementers of ideological and political work, they too must cultivate the habit of self-criticism. In fact, the process of conducting ideological education is also a process of resolving one's own ideological issues and improving one's ideological and political level. Educators must first be educated. Only by leading in the practice of self-criticism can one thoroughly abandon formalism and dogmatism, and change the bad image of being an educator who stands above the masses. Without self-criticism, there can be no genuine example-setting. In summary, adhering to and promoting self-criticism is a crucial guiding principle for improving and strengthening ideological and political work.

Emphasizing self-criticism does not mean underestimating external criticism, nor does it mean the old practice of introspection in isolation. Self-criticism cannot do without the impetus of external criticism. To conduct serious self-criticism, one must open up channels for communication, humbly listen to, and widely solicit various opinions to warn, correct, and improve oneself. In this sense, self-criticism can be seen as a deepened form of external criticism. Although they are different, they are not entirely separate. Similarly, self-criticism can also drive and guide external criticism. When leaders courageously acknowledge and correct their own shortcomings and mistakes, they often gain the sincere trust and active, candid criticism of the masses. On the contrary, covering up mistakes inevitably leads to negative consequences. In comparison, true scientific self-awareness, improvement, and advancement ultimately rely on self-criticism. External factors must act through internal factors. Further analysis shows that the self is not limited to the individual. A small collective can also be considered a self, and a large collective, such as a region or a country, can also be viewed as a self. Recently, the Central Committee of the Party has emphasized the establishment and implementation of supervision systems, and in terms of multi-party cooperation, it has required strengthening supervision over the Communist Party. Supervision is a form of external criticism, but as previously discussed, only by effectively combining extensive external supervision with serious self-criticism can the intended goals be better achieved.

### 重说自我批评

　　重说自我批评
    孙起孟
    自我批评是中国共产党区别于其他政党的显著标志之一。我想就此谈点看法。
    首先要指出的是，自我批评没有任何消极的意味，而是一种积极的、前进的、实事求是的优良作风。自我批评决不等于单纯的自我谴责，它是如实的、辩证唯物主义的自我认识，必须坚持一切从实际出发，才能达到这样的自我认识。为此，必须对自己实际生活中的是与非、功与过以及有关的经验与教训进行检查分析。在此基础上进行自我总结，分析主客观原因，进而提出改进的方案与措施。认真的自我批评要致力于把认识和实践紧密地结合起来，以切实行动表现出自我的改善与提高。这样，从自我认识发展为自我实践，然后再实践、再自我批评，如此循环往复，不断前进。
    现在强调思想政治工作的改进与加强、明确自我批评在此过程中的地位与作用十分重要。开展思想政治工作有两头，一头是思想政治工作的组织者与施行者，一头是思想政治工作的对象。开展自我批评，两头都不可或缺。思想政治工作是否真有效益，要看受教育者即思想政治工作的对象是否解决了思想问题，是否调动了自觉性、积极性和实践精神。为此，应该把思想政治工作落实到对象的自我认识、自我批评和自我改善、提高上来。对于思想政治工作的组织者和施行者来说，也要发扬自我批评的作风。实际上，进行思想教育的过程也是教育者自己解决思想问题、提高思想政治水平的过程。教育者一定要先受教育。只有他们率先发扬自我批评的作风，才有可能彻底抛弃形式主义、教条主义那一套，改变以教育者自居、高踞于群众之上的恶劣形象。离开了自我批评，就谈不到为群众所欢迎的言传身教。总之，坚持和发扬自我批评，是改进与加强思想政治工作至关重要的一项指导方针。
    强调自我批评，绝不意味着低估外部的批评，更不是过去所谓的闭门思过。自我批评离不开外部批评的推动。实行认真的自我批评，一定要广开言路，虚心听取和广泛征集各种意见，用以警戒自己，改正自己，提高自己。在这一点上，自我批评可以说就是深化了的外部批评。二者不同，但又非截然可分。同样，自我批评也能对外部批评起着推动、引导作用。领导者勇于公开和纠正自己的缺点和失误，伴随而来的往往是群众真诚的信任和坦率的积极的批评。反之，文过饰非必然导致恶果。就两者对比而言，真正科学的自我认识、改善、提高，毕竟要靠自我批评。外因总要通过内因起作用。进一步分析，自我也不限于个人。小集体也可理解为自我，大集体如一个地区、一个国家也可视为自我。近期以来，党中央强调建立和执行监督制度，在多党合作方面，要求加强对共产党的监督。监督是一种来自外部的批评形式，而从前述逻辑来看，只有把广泛的外部监督和认真的自我批评很好地结合起来，才能更好地实现预期的目的。
