Mayors of ten cities gathered in Nanjing recently to discuss vegetable supply, emphasizing the need to protect production to ensure consumption. A reporter from Market News, Cuixiuzhi, reported: Not long ago, the Fifth National Conference on Vegetable System Reform Experience Exchange was held in Nanjing. Mayors from ten major cities inspected various aspects of Nanjing's vegetable production, supply, and sales, and exchanged experiences on how to solve the problem of urban residents struggling to obtain vegetables.

The mayors praised Nanjing's vegetable supply, unanimously acknowledging that the Nanjing municipal government has invested significant effort in managing "vegetable gardens." Meanwhile, they reflected on their own "vegetable gardens." Zhang Ruichang, a responsible official from Shenyang, squeezed into a crowd of people carrying vegetable baskets, inquiring in detail about the prices and origins of various vegetables such as green beans, tomatoes, and cucumbers. He said, "Nanjing's summer vegetable varieties are also common in Shenyang, and a significant portion is transported from the south. He believed that vegetable operators should gradually establish a concept of large-scale vegetable market circulation, utilizing regional price differences to organize transportation and meet market demands.

The balance between vegetable production and sales is challenging. In the Shanghai and Nanjing regions, the production in half a year can differ by five to six times in a disaster year. Bo Dongjian, a responsible official from Wuhan, said: "Having too few vegetables is not good, and it's difficult to have just the right amount. Our experience is that having more is better than having less." He introduced that Wuhan's vegetables will continue to focus on liberalizing management, protecting production to ensure consumption.

The mayors believed that vegetable work should be done by protecting production to ensure consumption and stabilizing production to stabilize consumption. Lu Jianguo, a responsible official from Xi'an, said: "Nanjing has invested so much effort in a year to improve the infrastructure of vegetable bases, which is a promotion for us. Xi'an has also invested a lot in combining science and technology with agricultural production, with an investment of 450 million yuan last year." She expressed that Xi'an will continue to promote administrative leadership, scientific guidance, and market induction, striving to improve pre- and post-production services.

Huang Weining, a responsible official from Guangzhou, had a deep impression from this trip. He believed that after Guangzhou liberalized vegetable prices, residents have adapted to market fluctuations. Locally, there is a high demand for small vegetable varieties. Marketable vegetables like bitter gourds priced at over two yuan per pound are popular, while cabbages priced at four jiao per kilogram are not. Guangzhou, based on its own characteristics, ensures vegetable planting area, allows farmers to decide what to plant, and regulates vegetable varieties entering the market.

Li Yingjun, a responsible official from Nanjing, listened to the praise from his peers, recalling the winter and spring vegetable disasters when the public complained. Last year, he focused on managing "vegetable gardens," turning abandoned vegetable fields back into productive land, repairing damaged water facilities, and covering some greenhouses with plastic film, thereby possessing a certain disaster-resistance capability. After ten years of reform, Nanjing's vegetable management system has finally established a preliminary framework.

Zhao Mingxiao, a responsible official from Harbin, spoke loudly to his peers, "Harbin's summer climate is suitable. Next year, I welcome everyone to come and see the vegetable market. Let's have a competition to improve vegetable supply."

### 十城市市长在宁纵谈蔬菜供应  强调通过保护生产来保护消费

　　十城市市长在宁纵谈蔬菜供应
    强调通过保护生产来保护消费
    本报讯  市场报记者崔秀芝报道：不久前，在南京举行的第五届全国１０城市蔬菜体制改革经验交流会上，来自１０大城市的市长们，考察了南京市蔬菜产供销的各个环节，并互相交流经验，探讨怎样解决城市居民吃菜难的问题。
    市长们对南京的蔬菜供应表示赞许，一致认为南京市政府抓“菜园子”花了力气。同时，对照各自的“菜园子”有感而发。沈阳市负责人张瑞昌挤到拎着菜篮子的人群中，详细询问四季豆、蕃茄、黄瓜等品种的价格和产地后说，南京的夏菜品种，沈阳也有不少，相当一部分是从南方运过去的，他认为，蔬菜经营者应逐步建立蔬菜市场大流通观念，利用地区差价组织调运，满足市场需求。
    蔬菜产销平衡难度较大，沪宁一带半年和灾年的产量要相差五六倍。武汉市负责人董绍简说：菜少了不好，不多不少很难办到，我们的体会是，还是多一点比少一点好。他介绍说，武汉蔬菜还将继续以放开经营为主，通过保护生产来保护消费。
    市长们认为，蔬菜工作要通过保护生产来保护消费，通过稳定生产来稳定消费。西安市负责人卢剑国说：南京在一年内花了这么大的力气，抓蔬菜基地的基础设施建设，对我们是个促进。西安市在科技与农业生产结合方面也花了大劲，去年投入４５０万元。她表示，西安市将继续推行行政领导，科技引导，市场诱导的做法，努力搞好产前产后服务工作。
    广州市负责人黄伟宁此行很有感受。他认为，广州的蔬菜价格放开后，居民随行就市已适应了。当地对蔬菜小品种需求量较大，市场上两元多１斤的毛瓜好销，每公斤４角钱的包菜却无人问津。广州根据自己特点，种菜面积保证，种什么菜由农民决定，蔬菜品种上市也由市场调节。
    南京市负责人李英俊听着同行的赞美声，想着前冬去春蔬菜受灾，群众骂娘的情景，心中像打翻了五味瓶。去年，他闷着头抓“菜园子”，抛荒的菜地种上了菜，破坏了的水利设施修复了，部分大棚盖上了塑料薄膜，具备了一定的抗灾能力。南京蔬菜管理体制经过１０年改革，终于搭起了初步框架。
    哈尔滨市负责人赵明孝声音宏亮地对同行们说，哈尔滨之夏气候适宜，明年欢迎各位前去看菜市。搞好蔬菜供应，让我们来个竞赛。
