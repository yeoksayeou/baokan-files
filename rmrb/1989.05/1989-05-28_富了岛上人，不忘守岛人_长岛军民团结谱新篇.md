The military and civilians of Changdao County in Shandong Province have adapted to the characteristics of the new era to carry out support for the government and love for the military, and support and care for military families. Through the close unity between the military and civilians, they have promoted social stability and driven the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization on the island.

Under the reform and opening-up policy, Changdao County's economy has developed rapidly. The people say: "Enrich the islanders, do not forget the island defenders." To better help the troops solve their difficulties, the people of Zhongcun Village in Dangjiao Town established a mass organization—the Support the Military Fund. Village-run enterprises, economic cooperatives, and individuals who have become wealthy first donated generously. The fund used these donations to build recreation rooms for the troops and to help soldiers whose families have temporarily encountered special difficulties.

The soldiers stationed on the island proposed: "The people are our parents, the island is our hometown." They requested approval from their superiors to provide idle barracks, communication equipment, and mechanical boats to the local area for urgent use. They also opened 21 military wharves and actively participated in the construction of 36 local medium and small-sized projects.

　　“富了岛上人，不忘守岛人”
    长岛军民团结谱新篇
    据新华社济南５月２８日电  （记者宋熙文、王志耘）山东省长岛县军民适应新时期特点开展拥政爱民、拥军优属工作，以军民之间的亲密团结，促进社会的安定，推动海岛社会主义物质文明和精神文明建设。
    在改革开放的形势下，长岛县经济发展很快。群众说：“富了岛上人，不忘守岛人”。为了更好地帮助部队解决困难，砣矶镇中村成立了一个群众性组织——拥军基金会，村办企业、经济联合体和先富起来的个人踊跃捐款。基金会把这些捐款用来为部队建娱乐室，帮助家中临时发生特殊困难的战士。
    驻岛部队指战员提出：“群众是父母，海岛是故乡”。他们报请上级批准，将部队闲置的营房、通讯设备和机械船只提供给地方急用，并开放２１座军用码头，积极参加地方３６项中小型工程建设。
