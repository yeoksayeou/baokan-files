    Developing Rural Commercial Housing
    Changjing Becomes a Pilot Township

    According to a report from our newspaper, Jiangsu Province's Jiangyin City's Changjing Township has recently become a national pilot township for the demonstration of rural commercial housing development. The first batch of aesthetically pleasing, practical, single-family homes with vibrant colors has been sold out; the second batch of more modern-style homes is soon to be handed over; and the blueprints for the third batch of homes have been drawn, with construction about to begin.

    It is understood that the price of these commercial homes ranges from 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per unit, with a usable area of around 100 square meters, offering good value for money. This approach is beneficial for the planning of new rural areas and for saving arable land.

　　开发农村商品房
    长泾成为试点乡
    本报讯  江苏省江阴市长泾最近成为全国农村示范商品房开发试点乡。首批造型美观实用、独门独户、色彩美丽的住宅，已被抢售一空；第二批式样更新型的住宅即将交付使用；第三批住宅已绘出蓝图，动工在即。
    据了解，这些商品房每套价格在３万至４万元之间，使用面积在１００平方米左右，价廉物美。这样做，有利于新农村的规划，节省耕地。
