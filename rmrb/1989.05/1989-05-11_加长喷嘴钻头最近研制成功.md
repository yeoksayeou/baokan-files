The extended nozzle drill bit was recently developed successfully by the China University of Petroleum and the scientific and technical personnel of the Shengli Oilfield. The experts have evaluated that it has reached or partially exceeded international advanced levels and has been granted a utility model patent by the State Patent Office. The birth of this achievement also solves an important theoretical problem in the field of petroleum drilling technology that has not been resolved for many years regarding the priority of hydraulic parameters.

After more than three years of field experiments in oilfields such as Shengli, Zhongyuan, and Jiangsu, the use of this drill bit has increased the mechanical drilling speed by 15-30% and the footage by 25-50%.

　　加长喷嘴钻头最近研制成功
    本报讯  由石油大学和胜利油田科技人员研制成功加长喷嘴钻头，最近经专家鉴定，达到或部分超过国际先进水平，并获国家专利局实用新型专利权。这一成果的诞生，也解决了石油钻井技术优先水力参数多年未解决的一个重要理论问题。
    经胜利、中原、江苏等油田三年多的现场实验，使用这种钻头，机械钻速提高１５—３０％，进尺提高２５—５０％。　（归长根、樊晨）
