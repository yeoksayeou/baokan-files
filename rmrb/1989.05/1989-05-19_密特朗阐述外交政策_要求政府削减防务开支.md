Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 19th.

French President Mitterrand held a press conference at the Élysée Palace yesterday, outlining France's three main proposals for achieving the goal of maintaining peace. These are: first, France advocates accelerating disarmament and easing tensions; second, maintaining a balance among all parties, not just a simple numerical balance, but conducting dialogue between partners or opposing sides; third, resolving regional conflicts on the basis of respecting the rights of the people, the integrity, and sovereignty of nations.

This was Mitterrand's first press conference since taking office as president. In discussing defense policy, Mitterrand proposed that France should reduce its defense spending, calling for a decrease of 45 billion francs in defense expenditures between 1990 and 1993.

According to reports, President Mitterrand will visit Canada and the United States today. His diplomatic schedule for the latter part of this month includes attending the summit of French-speaking African heads of state in Senegal, participating in the human rights conference of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Paris, and attending the NATO summit in Brussels. Starting in June, Mitterrand will successively visit Tunisia, Poland, and Spain. Therefore, this press conference has attracted considerable interest.

　　密特朗阐述外交政策    
    要求政府削减防务开支
    本报巴黎５月１９日电  记者张启华报道：法国总统密特朗昨天在爱丽舍宫举行的记者招待会上阐述了法国实现维护和平目标的三项主张。即：一、法国主张加快裁军，缓和紧张局势；二、保持各方均衡，不是简单的数量上的平衡，而是要在伙伴或对立双方进行对话；三、在尊重人民的权利、国家的完整和主权基础上解决地区之间的冲突。
    这是密特朗蝉任总统后首次举行的记者招待会。密特朗在阐述防务政策时提出，法国应削减防务开支，要求在１９９０至１９９３年之间减少４５０亿法郎的国防费用。
    据报道，密特朗总统今天出访加拿大、美国。他的本月下旬的外交日程是，赴塞内加尔出席非洲法语国家首脑会谈，在巴黎参加欧安会人权会议，到布鲁塞尔参加北约首脑会议。从６月开始，密特朗将先后出访突尼斯、波兰、西班牙。因此，这次记者招待会引起较大的兴趣。
