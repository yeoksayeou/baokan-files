A certain internal combustion engine factory was reported to have been eager to get rich, neglecting internal management while focusing on external relations. They spent money vertically to curry favor and horizontally to build relationships. Despite the significant expenses, their products were of poor quality, leading users to cut ties, and their business declined.

Another factory producing similar products started later but focused on management, upgrading, deepening reforms, and improving operations. Their products, known for high quality and low prices, were favored by users. Both local and external users flocked to establish long-term supply relationships.

These two pieces of news are thought-provoking. Running a business and pursuing prosperity and development is a common goal. However, the methods to achieve this are crucial.

Currently, some factories, facing fierce market competition, focus on deception, bribery, and other unethical practices. They may use false advertising or give kickbacks and gifts to build relationships. These methods might seem effective in the short term but cannot sustain long-term success. Developing a commodity economy requires strategic planning, but the fundamental principle is to ensure the product is genuine and of high quality. Otherwise, mixing inferior products with superior ones will eventually be exposed, leading to misfortune and even collapse.

On the surface, market competition seems chaotic. However, it follows an inevitable internal logic. According to the rules of market competition, strengthening internal capabilities is the key to a company's prosperity and development. Unlike those who resort to shortcuts, some factory managers remain calm in the face of competition. They do not follow trends or get swayed by them. Instead, they adopt a pragmatic approach, deepening reforms, improving management mechanisms, conducting technical upgrades and training, adjusting product structures, and strengthening market forecasting. This way, they gain the upper hand in market competition.

The Chinese people have always valued the spirit of self-reliance and perseverance. In today's commodity economy, entrepreneurs must uphold this spirit. Because, just like in military battles, relying on tricks cannot match genuine skills. This is undeniable!

### 兴旺发达靠内功

　　兴旺发达靠内功
    牛宝贵
    报载，某地一内燃机厂“致富”心切，轻“内政”，重“外交”，纵向解囊进贡，大铺“通天路”；横向慷慨摆阔，巧搭“关系桥”，尽管破费不少，却因产品质量不行，用户“断交”，经营每况愈下。
    又据报载，一个生产同类产品的厂家，虽起步较晚，但由于一步一个脚印地抓管理，上等级，深化改革，改善经营，产品以质优价廉受到用户青睐。省内外用户纷纷登门，建立长期的供货关系。
    两则消息，发人深思。办企业，搞经营，兴旺发达之欲，人皆有之；然而，兴旺发达之法，却很有讲究。
    时下，有的厂家面对激烈的市场竞争，专在吹、拉、挤、靠、贿上作文章。或做假广告，或利用回扣送礼“联络感情”，这些办法倒是省劲，却不能得计于长久。发展商品经济，讲求经营策略是完全应该的。但有个基调，那就是货真价实。不然的话，掺杂造假，以劣充优，自以为得计，但是一旦被拆穿了“西洋景”，十有八九会背时、倒霉，甚至一蹶不振。
    表面看，市场竞争无规则。其实，它也有着不可抗拒的内在规律。根据市场竞争的规律，增强内功，才是企业兴旺发达的治本之计。与种种投机取巧的做法相反，一些生产厂家的经营者，临竞争而不乱。他们既不“刮风”，也不为“风”所动，而是以“不计一时一日之短长，不图一褒一奖之功名”的求实精神，深化改革，完善经营机制；开展技术改造、技术培训；调整产品结构、加强市场预测等方面下功夫，从而取得市场竞争的主动权。
    炎黄子孙自古崇尚自强不息的精神。在发展商品经济的今天，企业家尤有弘扬这种精神之必要。因为，市场竞争同军事战场上的较量一样，耍“花棒”终究比不得“真功夫”。这是笃定无疑的！
