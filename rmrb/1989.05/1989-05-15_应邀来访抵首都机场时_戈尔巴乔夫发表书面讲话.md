	Xinhua News Agency

	The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev, arrived in Beijing this noon and delivered a written speech at the Capital Airport. The full text of the speech is as follows:

	Dear Comrades!

	First of all, I would like to convey on behalf of the Soviet people the warmest greetings and best wishes to the friendly Chinese people. I wish the people of Beijing all the best and a happy life.

	We have come to China in spring, a season of nature's awakening and renewal. People all over the world associate renewal and hope with spring.

	This is in harmony with our feelings. We hope that our meetings and talks with the Chinese leaders will have epoch-making significance for the development of Soviet-Chinese relations, for the further development of these relations based on the principles of recognized state-to-state intercourse and good-neighborliness.

	We believe that the development of Soviet-Chinese relations truly reflects the fundamental interests of both sides and is in accord with the positive changes taking place in the world.

	We have always followed with great interest the reforms underway in China. But nothing can compare to coming to this country in person, to have direct contact with its leaders and people.

	This is my first visit to China. I hope to personally learn about this great country, which has made a tremendous contribution to human civilization and has an ancient cultural heritage, and to learn about the achievements of its people in the forty years of socialist development.

　　应邀来访抵首都机场时    
    戈尔巴乔夫发表书面讲话
    本报讯  苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫今天中午抵达北京后，在首都机场发表了书面讲话。讲话全文如下：尊敬的同志们！
    首先我想代表苏联各族人民向友好的中国人民转达亲切的问候和最良好的祝愿。祝北京人民万事如意，生活幸福。
    我们是在春天来到中国的。这是个大自然苏醒，万象更新的美好时节。世界各国人民都把更新和希望寄托于春天。
    这与我们的心情是一致的。我们希望我们同中国领导人要进行的会晤和谈判将对苏中关系，对建立在公认的国家间交往和睦邻的原则基础上的这种关系的进一步发展具有划时代的意义。
    我们认为，这种苏中关系的发展如实地反映了双方的根本利益，并与世界上出现的积极变化和谐相称。
    我们在苏联一直怀着极大的兴趣密切地注视着正在中国进行的改革。但是什么也比不上亲自到这个国家去看一看，同它的领导人和老百姓进行直接接触。
    我是第一次来中国，希望能够亲自了解一下这个对人类文明的发展作出了巨大贡献和具有古老文化特色的伟大国家，并了解它的人民在四十年来的社会主义发展中所取得的成绩。
