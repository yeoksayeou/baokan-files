After receiving Liu Gen Sheng's letter, the reporter visited the State Taxation Administration and relevant departments of the People's Bank of China regarding bank and tax policies. The following is a report of the situation:

1. The regulation that individual business households cannot open bank accounts has been changed. In the second half of 1988, the People's Bank of China clearly stipulated that individual industrial and commercial households can open bank accounts with their business licenses.

2. According to relevant regulations, income tax is withheld and paid by the supplying units. Banks do not have the obligation to withhold taxes. However, if the tax authorities find that a taxpayer has evaded or underreported taxes and refuses to make up the payments, they can notify the bank to forcibly transfer the funds.

3. Banks implement "free deposit and withdrawal." There is no limit on the amount of money that can be withdrawn with a check. However, due to the tightening of monetary policy by the state since the second half of last year, some local banks have insufficient cash on hand and have temporarily implemented certain flexible measures. It is believed that with the improvement of the economic situation, the situation of restricting the amount of money that can be withdrawn in some places will change or will soon change.

Storing temporarily unused cash in the bank not only supports national construction but also alleviates the concerns of individual business households. Paying various taxes in accordance with the law is a duty that every social organization and citizen should fulfill. It is hoped that all sectors, including individual business households, will understand this. Of course, if there are places or individual business outlets that have practices in violation of regulations, it is also hoped that they will be corrected in a timely manner.

    ——银行、税务局的答复
    接刘根胜来信后，记者就有关银行、税务政策走访了国家税务局、中国人民银行有关部门，现将情况报告如下：
    一、个体户不得在银行开立帐户的规定已经改变，１９８８年下半年，中国人民银行已明确规定，个体工商业户凭营业执照即可到银行开立帐户。
    二、按有关规定，所得税由供货等“源泉单位”扣交，银行没有代扣义务；但如果税务机关查实某纳税人确有偷、漏税行为，拒不补交，可通知银行强行划拨。
    三、银行实行“存取自由”。凭支票到银行取款，是没有数量限制的。但由于去年下半年以来国家抽紧银根，一些地方的银行现钞不足，临时制定了某些变通措施。相信随着经济形势的好转，个别地方限制取款数量的情况已经改变或就会改变。
    将暂时不用的现金存入银行，不仅支援了国家建设，也免除了个体户后顾之忧。按章交纳各种税收，是每个社会团体，公民应尽的义务。希望各界，包括个体户理解这一点。当然，一些地方或个别营业所如确有违反规定的做法，也希望及时纠正。
