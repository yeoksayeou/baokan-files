	Economic Overheating Requires Self-Restraint
	Kaifeng Tightly Controls Self-Funded Construction
	Four Consecutive Years Without Exceeding National Plan

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 9th — (Reporter Ji Shifa) Kaifeng City's planning, banking, and construction sectors have worked together to strictly control self-funded construction projects. From 1985 to 1988, the city successfully kept the scale of self-funded construction within the national plan, setting a good example in curbing economic overheating.

	During these four years, the provincial government allocated 33 million yuan for Kaifeng's self-funded construction projects. To strengthen the management of self-funded construction investments and uphold the seriousness of national plans, Kaifeng's Planning Commission, Construction Bank, and Urban Construction Bureau hold a joint meeting every month to review the execution of plans and strictly adhere to regulations.

	They began by strictly managing the planning process, insisting on proper procedures for project approvals. All new, expanded, renovated, restored, and relocated projects must submit a plan task book. Projects within the approval authority of the municipal Planning Commission must undergo investigation and research, comply with relevant national regulations, and have proof of sufficient funds from the Construction Bank and approval from the finance department before they can be approved. Otherwise, construction is not permitted.

	The management of self-funded construction funds follows the principle of "deposit first, approval second, use third, and use after six months of deposit." In recent years, all self-funded construction funds in Kaifeng have been deposited into the municipal Construction Bank, with a deposit rate of 100%. This is unique in Henan Province and rare nationwide.

　　经济过热须自我抑制    
    开封自筹基建卡得紧    
    连续四年未突破国家计划
    据新华社郑州５月９日电  （记者姬世法）开封市计划、银行、施工三方通力协作，严格把关，在１９８５年到１９８８年的４年中，自筹基建规模始终控制在国家下达的计划内，在抑制经济过热中带了好头。
    这４年里，省里下达给开封市的自筹基建投资规模为３３００万元。为了加强对自筹基建投资的管理，维护国家计划的严肃性，开封市计委、建行和城建局三方每月召开一次联席会议，检查计划执行情况，严格按章办事。
    他们先从严格计划管理做起，坚持基建申请审批程序。一切新建、扩建、改建、恢复和迁建项目，必须编报计划任务书，在市计委审批权限以内的，经过调查研究，符合国家有关规定，持有建行开具的资金足额存入证明和财政已经审查过的，方给以审批，否则一律不得施工。
    自筹基建资金管理按照“先存后批，先批后用，存足半年再用”的原则办事。近几年来，开封市所有自筹基建资金全部交存市建设银行，交存率达１００％，这在河南省独一无二，在全国也不多见。
