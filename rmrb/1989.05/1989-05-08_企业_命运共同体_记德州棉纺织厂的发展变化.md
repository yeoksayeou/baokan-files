Enterprise – Community of Destiny – A Record of the Development and Changes of Dezhou Cotton Textile Mill

Material interests are the most fundamental relationship between the enterprise and its employees.

When employees understand that discipline is for maintaining a shared destiny, discipline becomes truly ironclad.

Enterprise – Community of Destiny – A Record of the Development and Changes of Dezhou Cotton Textile Mill

By Mo Xinyuan, People’s Daily Reporter

A textile worker returning from a night shift saw a few trucks from out of town parked by the road, asking for directions to Dezhou Cotton Mill. When she learned that these trucks were delivering urgently needed chemical fiber raw materials to her factory, she immediately turned back, leading the drivers to the factory gate on her bicycle, despite being seven or eight miles away and already tired from a day's work. The drivers were deeply moved, saying, "We've been to many places, but we've never seen workers who care so much about their own enterprise!"

This incident happened in December 1988, but the worker has not been found to this day. The factory party secretary, Yu Xiangyang, explained, "We eventually gave up the search because such workers are too numerous in our factory..."

Indeed, when employees tie their own destiny to the enterprise, such incidents become quite common.

So, how was this "community of destiny" at Dezhou Cotton Mill formed?

A fair distribution of material interests is the solid bond that ties employees and the enterprise into a community of destiny.

"One hundred guns (for hunting), two hundred nets (for fishing), and three hundred wild carpenters," this catchy phrase vividly depicts the chaotic situation at Dezhou Cotton Mill five years ago. This state-owned cotton textile mill, established in 1958, was a notorious example of a "cancer-stricken" enterprise in Shandong Province. The new factory director, Wang Genyuan, and the party secretary, Yu Xiangyang, received as their welcome gift hundreds of transfer requests.

Where was the root of the problem? Wang Genyuan and Yu Xiangyang, both university graduates who had come to the factory in 1970, understood a fundamental truth after years of trials and tribulations:

If we acknowledge that material needs are a person's most basic demand of society, then we must acknowledge that material interests are the most fundamental relationship between the enterprise and its employees. Only when employees truly regard the enterprise as the carrier of their own interests can this rusty machine start running normally.

The question is, how can each employee's material interests be linked to the enterprise to unleash everyone's enthusiasm? The answer is to handle it according to the principle of "fairness," and the most fair principle we can implement is distribution according to work.

Distribution according to work—hasn't this been said for years? Yes, the key is not in shouting but in truly implementing it. Therefore, upon taking office, they announced the first reform plan to the entire workforce: piecework wages for frontline workers, with no upper limit and no guarantee of a minimum; reduce the number of workers in the third line and implement a position-based wage system, linking income to actual performance.

Even now, that reform was quite bold. It made the frontline workers, who did the heaviest work and contributed the most, earn more than the second and third-line workers for the first time, gradually widening the gap. The long-suppressed enthusiasm for work burst forth. After the reform in 1985, the mill achieved a profit of 15.28 million yuan, surpassing the total of the previous three years and immediately shedding its label of backwardness.

"Want to earn money? Go to Dezhou Cotton Mill," thus the saying went in Dezhou City. Last year, the average income of Dezhou Cotton Mill workers was 2,300 yuan, indeed not low. However, if you had seen the working conditions of Dezhou Cotton Mill workers, you would feel that this money was not easily earned.

Piecework wages stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm, but then they encountered the problem of the total wage amount not being able to be exceeded. What to do? Wang Genyuan took two steps: the first was to implement a policy of reducing the number of workers in the workshops and teams without reducing wages, encouraging them to reduce the number of workers themselves. The surplus workers were either reassigned or used to start self-sustaining tertiary industries; the second step was to gradually expand production scale, increasing work without increasing the number of workers. Currently, Dezhou Cotton Mill's spindles and looms have increased from 50,000 spindles and 1,908 looms before the reform to nearly 100,000 spindles and 2,216 looms. According to the second-class standard set by the ministry, Dezhou Cotton Mill is allocated 7,000-plus workers, but the actual number of workers is over 5,000. This means that Dezhou Cotton Mill is now 5 people doing the work of 7, which of course also means that 5 people are earning the wages of 7.

It is precisely by seriously implementing the principle of distribution according to work that the needs of the enterprise's development and the employees' desire to increase their income are harmonized on the basis of improving labor productivity. Currently, the labor efficiency of spinning and weaving at Dezhou Cotton Mill has increased by 36.8% and 49.3% respectively compared to before the reform. The long-lagging Dezhou Cotton Mill now has multiple economic indicators such as profit per hundred yuan of output value, profit per sales revenue, and profit per capita, which have been at the forefront of large and medium-sized cotton textile enterprises nationwide for three consecutive years.

Employees see hope in the enterprise's revitalization and are willing to commit for life, thus fundamentally avoiding short-term behavior.

The fixed assets of Dezhou Cotton Mill have increased from 23.93 million yuan in 1985 to the current 35.34 million yuan.

Strict management and iron discipline are necessary guarantees for maintaining the community of destiny.

Have you heard the story of "taking a plane to take a bath"?

Once, a few young men from the machine repair workshop went to the boiler room to take a bath during work hours, resulting in a deduction of their monthly bonus and a reduction of their wages for three months. Someone joked with them, "This bath cost a lot, enough to fly to Guangzhou and back."

The strict management of Dezhou Cotton Mill is famous far and wide. In Dezhou Cotton Mill, going out during work hours, whether for official or personal business, regardless of whether one is a cadre or a worker, must be approved by the supervising leader, issued a pass, and verified by the gate guard before being allowed to leave. Over the years, the passes have changed from paper to plastic to metal.

Dezhou Cotton Mill has over 200 kinds of regulations and 700-plus clauses, of which over 100 are related to workers' work and behavioral norms. One regulation states that smoking is strictly prohibited in any part of the factory area (including production and office areas), with the first offense resulting in a demotion, the second offense resulting in a warning, and the third offense resulting in dismissal. For a heavy smoker, this restraint is almost at the limit of physiological endurance.

Since this regulation was announced, 5 people have been punished. But no one was resentful. Neither was there any sympathy.

Why do the workers of Dezhou Cotton Mill have such strong endurance?

An old worker said, "None of us want to go back to the loose and slack days of the past."

A cadre with a heavy smoking habit said, "30% of textile factory fires are caused by smoking. We can't let one person's carelessness destroy the hard work and hopes of thousands of people."

Yes, when workers understand that discipline is for maintaining a shared destiny, that discipline truly becomes ironclad.

Enterprise spirit and enterprise pride are the spiritual pillars of this enterprise community of destiny.

In recent years, the appearance of Dezhou Cotton Mill has changed greatly. 23 residential buildings have been built. The factory hospital has added advanced medical equipment. Primary and secondary school students have moved into spacious and bright teaching buildings. The trade union has set up an amateur performance team and a military band that are not inferior to professional organizations.

The factory has also built a closed-circuit television system, and every evening, workers eagerly sit at home watching television news about their own affairs...

At the same time, Dezhou Cotton Mill and its representatives, Wang Genyuan and Yu Xiangyang, have received many honorable titles from the province and even the nation.

All of this is welfare, entertainment, and cultural activities, but they all, in different ways, propagate the enterprise spirit and enhance the cohesion of the enterprise.

"I am from Dezhou Cotton Mill!" When the workers of Dezhou Cotton Mill talk about their factory, they are always full of pride.

In Dezhou Cotton Mill, you won't hear discussions about the positions of masters and servants. A worker said, "A family living together can't have everyone making decisions. The key is for the head of the household to be smart and capable, and to act fairly." In fact, many major distribution plans, behavioral norms, and reward and punishment regulations of Dezhou Cotton Mill have been fully discussed by all the workers. Once institutionalized, they are equally applicable to the director and the workers, with no exceptions. Fair institutions and strict enforcement of institutions blur the differences in status between leaders and workers, emphasizing only the differences in division of labor.

I asked Wang Genyuan, "What are the standards for establishing a community of destiny?" He smiled and said, "This is a soft thing, it can't have hard indicators, and it certainly can't be self-proclaimed." He thought for a moment and added, "There are standards, that is, when the enterprise encounters difficulties, can the workers actively share the burdens and solve the problems?"

His standard has already been verified. In the past year, due to shortages of energy and raw materials, Dezhou Cotton Mill has encountered unprecedented difficulties. The entire workforce, with a strong sense of responsibility, actively shared the difficulties. In the first two months of this year, Dezhou Cotton Mill achieved a profit of over 150 million yuan, which is rare in the national textile industry where many enterprises are experiencing reduced production and losses.

    企业——命运共同体
    ——记德州棉纺织厂的发展变化
    本报记者　莫新元
    纺织女工下夜班骑车回家，忽见几辆外地来的卡车停在道旁打听去德州棉纺厂的路。当她得知这些车是给自己的工厂送急需的化纤原料时，就不顾一天的劳累，不顾已经走出七八里路，立即返回，骑着自行车给司机带路，一直把车队领到厂门口，才悄然离去。司机们深受感动，说，走了这么多地方，没见过这样关心自己企业的工人！
    这件事发生在１９８８年１２月，可是至今也没找到这位女工。厂党委书记于向阳这样解释：“我们后来放弃了寻找的努力，因为这样的职工在我们这里太多了……”
    是的，当职工们把自己的命运同企业紧紧联结在一起的时候，这样的事情的确变得很平常了。
    那么，德棉这个“命运共同体”是怎样形成的呢？
    　　　　公平的物质利益分配关系，是职工与企业结成命运共同体的坚实纽
    　　带。
    “一百条枪（打猎），二百张网（捕鱼），还有三百野木匠”，这句顺口溜形象地描绘了五年前德棉厂的混乱状况。这个始建于１９５８年的国营棉纺织厂，是山东省有名的“患了癌症”的典型，新任厂长王根源和书记于向阳得到的见面礼，就是几百份请调报告。
    病根在哪里？王根源、于向阳这两位同是１９７０年来厂的大学毕业生，通过十几年的风风雨雨，他们深深懂得这样一个道理：
    如果我们承认物质需求是一个人对社会的最基本的需求，就应该承认，物质利益是维系企业与职工的最基本的关系。职工真正把企业当成自身利益的载体时，这架生锈的机器才可能正常地运转起来。
    问题是每个职工的物质利益怎样同企业发生联系，才能使大家的积极性发挥出来？那就是必须根据一个“公平”的原则来处理，而目前我们所能实行的最公平的原则就是按劳分配。
    按劳分配，这不是多少年来一直说的吗？是的，关键不在于喊，而在于真正落实。所以，他们上任后，向全厂职工宣布的第一份改革方案就是：一线工人实行计件工资，上不封顶，下不保底；压缩三线编制，实行岗位结构工资，收入与工作实绩挂钩。
    即使现在看，那次改革也是很大胆的。它使干活儿最重、贡献最大的一线工人在收入上第一次超过了二、三线工人，并逐步拉开了距离，干多干少，干好干坏不一样了。压抑多年的劳动热情迸发出来了。改革后的１９８５年，实现利润１５２８万元，超过前三年的总和，一举摘掉了落后帽子。
    “要挣钱，上德棉”，于是在德州市，流传着这样的口头语。去年德棉厂职工人均收入２３００元，确实不低。可是，如果你亲眼见了德棉厂职工的劳动情景，你会觉得，这钱挣得不容易。
    计件工资刺激了工人的生产热情，这时，碰上了工资总额不能突破的问题。怎么办？王根源采取了两个步骤：第一步是在车间班组实行减人不减资，促使其自行减少用工，富余出来的人员或另行安置，或兴办自食其力的第三产业；第二步是逐步扩大生产规模，增活儿不增人。目前德棉厂的纱锭和织机分别由改革前的５万锭和１９０８台发展到近１０万锭和２２１６台。按部颁二档标准德棉厂核定用工为７０００多人，而德棉厂实际用工为５０００多人。这就是说，德棉厂现在是５个人干着７个人的活儿，这当然也意味着，５个人挣着７个人的钱。
    正是认真贯彻按劳分配原则，把企业发展的需要同职工增加收入的愿望，在提高劳动生产率的基础上相吻合了。德棉厂目前纺纱和织布的劳动效率，分别比改革前提高了３６．８％和４９．３％。长期落后的德棉厂，如今的百元产值利税率、销售收入利税率、人均创利润率等多项经济指标，已连续３年居全国大中型棉纺织企业的前列。
    职工从企业的振兴中看到了希望，并愿意以终身相许，这就从根本上避免了短期行为。
    德棉的固定资产也由１９８５年的２３９３万元增加到目前的３５３４万元。
    　　　　严格管理和铁的纪律是维系命运共同体的必要保证。
    你听说过“坐飞机洗澡”的故事吗？
    有一回，几个机修车间的小伙子上班时到锅炉房洗澡，结果受到了扣除当月奖金和下浮３个月工资的处罚。有人向他们打趣地说：“这个澡钱可没少花，坐飞机来回到广州去洗都够了。”
    德棉厂管理之严，远近闻名。在德棉厂，上班时外出，不论公事私事，不管干部工人，必须经主管领导批准，发给出门证，门岗验证后方可放行。几年来，出门证由纸的，换成了塑料的、金属的。
    德棉厂的各种规章制度多达２００多种，７００多条，其中有关职工的工作、行为准则就有１００多条。有一条规定，厂区任何部位（包括生产区和办公区）严禁吸烟，违者第一次降一级工资，第二次留用察看，第三次除名。对一个烟瘾大的人来说，这条约束几乎到了生理承受的极限。
    自此条例公布以来，有５人受罚。但没有不服气的。也没有表同情的。
    为什么德棉厂的职工有这么强的承受力？
    一位老工人说：“我们谁也不愿意回到过去松松垮垮的年月里去。”
    一位烟瘾挺大的机关干部说：“纺织厂的火灾，３０％是由吸烟引起的。不能由于一个人的不慎，使几千人的心血和希望毁于一旦。”
    是的，当职工们明白，纪律是为了维护共同命运的时候，那纪律就真成铁的了。
    　　　　企业精神、企业自豪感，是企业这个命运共同体的精神支柱。
    这几年，德棉厂的面貌发生了很大的变化。２３座宿舍楼拔地而起。厂医院添置了先进的医疗设备。中小学生搬进了宽敞明亮的教学楼。工会办起了装备不亚于专业团体的职工业余演出队、军乐队。
    厂里还建起了闭路电视系统，职工们每天晚上兴致勃勃地坐在家里收看报道自己事情的电视新闻……
    与此同时，德棉厂和作为德棉人的代表的王根源、于向阳等，获得了全省及至全国的许多光荣称号。
    这一切，是福利，是娱乐，是文化活动，但它们都在通过不同的方式，宣扬着企业精神，增强着企业的凝聚力。
    “我是德棉的！”当德棉厂的职工谈起他们的工厂时，总是充满了自豪感。
    在德棉厂，听不到诸如主人、公仆地位的争论。一位工人就这样说：“一家人过日子，不能谁都说了算，关键要当家人精明能干，办事公道。”事实上，德棉厂的许多重大的分配方案、行为守则、奖惩条例，都经过了全厂职工的充分讨论。而一旦制度化，对厂长工人一律平等，谁也不能例外。公平的制度和制度的严明，淡化了领导和工人身份上的差别，强调的只是分工的不同。
    我问王根源：“命运共同体的建立，有没有什么标准？”他笑着说：“这是个软家伙，不可能有硬指标，更不能自封。”他沉思片刻，补充道：“标准还是有的，就是看当企业遇到困难时，职工能不能主动地替企业分忧解难。”
    他说的标准已经得到了验证。去年以来，由于能源、原材料紧缺，德棉厂遇到了前所未有的困难。全厂职工以高度的责任感，主动分担困难。今年１、２月份，德棉厂实现利润１５０多万元，这在全国纺织行业出现大面积减产和亏损的情况下，是不多见的。
