The early marriage phenomenon in Shandong Province is showing a significant increasing trend. According to statistics from relevant departments, as of now, the province has at least 500,000 people who have married before reaching the legal marriage age.

Illegal early marriages mostly occur in rural areas. The proportion of illegal early marriages among the same age group (males aged 15-21, females aged 15-19) is 5.06%. The phenomenon of illegal early marriages is most severe among rural males. According to a survey, among males aged 21, 30% have married early, meaning that out of every three young men, one has married illegally.

Even more alarming, some rural areas have seen the re-emergence of outdated customs such as "child betrothals" and "child marriages," which had previously disappeared. According to a sample survey by the Women's Federation in Laoling City, Shandong Province, out of 3,107 children aged 8-14, 642 have been betrothed, accounting for 20.7%; out of 3,840 young people aged 15-22, 1,152 have been betrothed, accounting for 30%. In one village in Wujia Township, the second-grade class of the primary school has 40 students, of whom 31 have been betrothed, accounting for 77.5% of the total number of students in the class. Additionally, the trend of marrying without a marriage certificate before reaching the legal marriage age is also spreading.

The result of early marriages often leads to early childbearing. In 1987, 46,000 children were born due to illegal early marriages, accounting for 2.5% of the total population born in the province.

    山东早婚现象呈递增趋势
    农村男青年非法早婚者占三分之一
    本报讯  山东省早婚现象呈现出显著的递增趋势。据有关部门统计，截至目前，全省未到法定婚龄的已婚人口至少已有50万人。
    非法早婚的现象大都发生在农村。其非法早婚人口占同年龄组（男15—21岁、女15—19岁）人口的5.06％。非法早婚现象以农村男性人口最严重。据调查，在21岁的男性人口中，早婚者占30％，就是说，每3个男性青年中，就有一个非法早婚。
    更有甚者，有的农村已绝迹多年的“娃娃亲”、“童子婚”等陈规陋习又重新出现。据山东省乐陵市妇联抽样调查，3107名8—14岁少年中已订“娃娃亲”的有642人，占20.7％；3840名15—22岁的青少年中，已订亲的有1152人，占30％。该市五集乡有一个村的小学二年级有40名学生，订亲的就有31名，占全班学生总数的77.5％。另外，不到法定婚龄，不领结婚证就结婚的现象也有蔓延的趋势。
    早婚的结果往往造成早育。1987年由于非法早婚而生育的孩子就有4.6万人，占全省出生总人口的2.5％。
