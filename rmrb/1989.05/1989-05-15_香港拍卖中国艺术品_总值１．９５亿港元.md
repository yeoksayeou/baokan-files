One of the world's largest art auction houses, Sotheby's, will hold an auction in Hong Kong from May 12th to 18th, featuring Chinese porcelain, handicrafts, modern Chinese paintings, jade jewelry, and jade carvings with a total value of 1.95 billion Hong Kong dollars.

The auction, organized by Sotheby's (Hong Kong) Limited, includes over 100 pieces of Ming and Qing Dynasty porcelain acquired by the British Railways Pension Fund between 1974 and 1980, with an estimated sale value of 55 million Hong Kong dollars. Additionally, there are 365 important pieces of Chinese porcelain and handicrafts, as well as 185 modern Chinese paintings.

Several rare porcelain pieces are particularly noteworthy. One is a rare Song Dynasty official kiln celadon item, which is extremely rare and difficult to value; another is a Ming Yongle blue and white dragon-patterned vase, considered a first-class collectible worldwide, with an estimated value of 70 to 90 million Hong Kong dollars.

Among the paintings up for auction, 44 are works by renowned artists such as Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi.

Sotheby's was established in 1744 and has nearly 70 offices worldwide.
