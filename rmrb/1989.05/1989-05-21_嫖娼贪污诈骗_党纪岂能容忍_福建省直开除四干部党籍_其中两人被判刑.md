Prostitution, Embezzlement, Fraud: Party Discipline Cannot Tolerate Such Behavior

Fujian Province Expels Four Officials from the Party
Two of Them Sentenced to Prison

FUZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) — The Fujian Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission recently expelled four officials from the Party for various violations. Two of them were also sentenced to prison terms.

The officials involved are:

1. Zhang Jing, Deputy Director of the Foreign Economic and Trade Commission's Foreign Investment Management Office, who was found to have engaged in prostitution multiple times.
2. Huang Songfan, Director of the Office of the Fujian Provincial Defense Science and Technology Industry Supply and Marketing Co., who embezzled 5,258 yuan of public funds.
3. Li Zhengyang, a Physical Education Researcher at the Provincial Public Security School, who extorted and defrauded a total of 627,000 yuan.
4. Hua Rong, an official at the Provincial Government Affairs Management Bureau, who profited from illegal car sales totaling 19,100 yuan.

Huang Songfan and Li Zhengyang were sentenced to 2 years and 8 years in prison, respectively.

Zhang Jing, aged 35, engaged in prostitution on nine occasions between May and October 1987.

Huang Songfan, who joined the Party in 1960, embezzled public funds during two relocation projects in 1985 by creating false charges such as "management fees," "procedure fees," and "compensation for property prices."

Li Zhengyang, a teacher, used the pretext of helping others obtain exit permits to commit fraud in 12 incidents between August 1982 and December 1986. He defrauded 27 individuals, totaling 627,000 yuan in Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou.

Hua Rong, aged 34, was involved in car trading before transferring to the Fujian Provincial Government Affairs Management Bureau in 1986. In early 1985, he introduced eight DAF minivans from the Dongfang Trade and Industry Company to the Yong'an City Investment Enterprise Office in Fuzhou, charging 4,000 yuan per vehicle for handling fees. Hua Rong received 9,000 yuan. Later, due to issues with the car's quality, the Dongfang Trade and Industry Company refunded 24,000 yuan to the Yong'an side. After deducting 900 yuan he gave to others, Hua Rong's illegal gains amounted to 19,100 yuan.

　　嫖娼贪污诈骗　党纪岂能容忍
    福建省直开除四干部党籍
    其中两人被判刑
    本报福州５月２１日电  记者张铭清报道：嫖宿暗娼的福建省外经贸委外资管理处副处长张晶、贪污公款５２５８元的福建省国防科技工业供销公司办公室主任黄松藩、勒索诈骗达６２万多元的省人民警察学校军体教研室教员李政扬、倒卖汽车牟利１．９万多元的省府机关事务管理局干部花荣，最近分别被开除党籍。黄松藩、李政扬分别被判处２年、８年有期徒刑。中共福建省纪委近日为此发了通报。
    ３５岁的张晶从１９８７年５月至１０月间，先后９次嫖宿暗娼。１９６０年入党的黄松藩在１９８５年两次负责办理拆迁工作中，巧立名目，以抽“管理费”、“手续费”、“产价赔偿费”等借口多报拆迁费贪污公款私分。从１９８２年８月到１９８６年１２月，身为教员的李政扬以帮助别人办出境手续为名，先后在福州、厦门、泉州等地诈骗作案１２起，骗取人民币６２．７万多元。被骗者达２７人之多。今年３４岁的花荣，１９８６年转业到福建省政府机关事务管理局前，便参与买卖汽车。１９８５年初，他介绍东方工贸联合公司８部大发牌小旅行车卖给永安市投资企业驻榕办，每部收取手续费４０００元。花荣分得９０００元。后因汽车质量等问题，东方工贸公司退给永安方面２．４万元款。扣除他分给他人９００元，花荣实际非法所得１９１００元。
