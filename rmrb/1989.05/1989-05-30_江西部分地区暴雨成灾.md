From May 26th to the morning of the 29th, heavy rain fell in the Shangrao region, Jiujiang, Nanchang, and Jingdezhen cities, as well as the northern parts of Yichun and Fuzhou in Jiangxi Province. In some areas, torrential rain occurred.

The Shangrao region was particularly hard hit. Between 8 AM on the 27th and 8 AM on the 28th, the 24-hour rainfall in Yugan, Wannian, and Shangrao counties (cities) exceeded 100 millimeters. The heavy rain caused the Xinjiang River, one of the five major rivers in Jiangxi Province, to exceed its warning level in the Shangrao city section, leading to flooding in areas such as the railway station and a middle school. The large reservoirs within the region exceeded their restricted water levels by 0.94 meters and have now begun to release water.
