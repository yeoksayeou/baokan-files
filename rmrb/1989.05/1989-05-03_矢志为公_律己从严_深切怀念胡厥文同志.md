Resolute in Public Service, Strict in Self-Discipline — Deeply Missing Comrade Hu Jiewen
Sun Qimeng

On the night of April 16, the news of Comrade Hu Jiewen's passing was conveyed over the phone. I immediately rushed to Beijing Hospital. Standing by the bedside of the late Comrade Hu, gazing at his peaceful, sleeping-like appearance, I could hardly believe that this patriot who had struggled for nearly a century for the destiny of the nation, who had dedicated 70 years to the revitalization of the national economy, and who had led the China Democratic National Construction Association in collaboration with the Communist Party of China and the people of the entire nation through 40 years of storms and struggles, would bid us farewell! In that moment, his lifelong dedication, diligence, and unwavering commitment to the country and the people surged through my mind.

A Distinguished Representative of the Patriotic Industrial and Commercial Circles

Comrade Hu was born at the turn of the last century. At that time, China was beset by external imperialist aggression and plunder, and internal feudal oppression and exploitation, leaving the nation in turmoil and the people on the brink of despair. Many patriots, amidst this hardship, sought various paths to national prosperity and strength. Comrade Hu, along with many contemporaries, recognized the fundamental truth that poverty and backwardness lead to subjugation, and chose the path of "industrial salvation." What was remarkable was that he did not confine himself to the ideal of "industrial salvation," but always linked his fate with the future of the nation, adapting to the times, and advancing with the tide of history, steadfastly practicing his patriotic, nation-saving, and nation-building aspirations. Thus, he became a pioneer and leader of China's industrial and commercial circles.

At the age of 26, Comrade Hu established the Xinmin Machinery Factory, marking the beginning of his career as an industrialist. He always linked personal development with national prosperity and the welfare of the people. His motto was that if foreigners could make it, Xinmin Factory could too. He was passionate about absorbing advanced technology and developing new products. His products, known for their superior quality and affordability, were well-received by users. In a few years, his enterprise grew from one to five, gaining widespread acclaim. Comrade Hu was not content with personal success; to promote the common development of the machinery industry, he actively advocated for the establishment of industry associations to strengthen connections and mutual cooperation. In 1927, the Shanghai Machinery Industry Association was founded, and he was unanimously elected as the chairman. He served in this role for a total of ten consecutive years. In his poem "Competition Festival of the Machinery Industry Association," he expressed his ideals and aspirations:

"The prosperity of the nation rests on industry,
Only through diligence and wisdom can we achieve greatness.
In competition, our hearts are set on strengthening the race,
In winning, we have no intention of personal glory.
In pursuit of excellence, the journey is endless,
The furnace and hammer forge the winds of peace."

After the "September 18th Incident" in 1931, national contradictions became increasingly sharp. Comrade Hu felt that in times of national crisis, how could one remain indifferent to business? Thus, he united his peers and actively participated in the resistance efforts. During the Battle of Shanghai, he mobilized and organized dozens of enterprises to relocate machinery to the southern part of Shanghai, establishing temporary workshops to produce hand grenades, artillery shells, landmines, and naval mines to support the frontline troops. For dozens of days, he worked tirelessly, day and night, without time to shave or cut his hair, until his beard grew long, earning him the nickname "Huzi" (Bearded Hu). He decided to keep his beard as a reminder of the national crisis and vowed to shave it only after the victory of the resistance. In 1937, with the start of the full-scale war of resistance, he followed the needs of the resistance, disregarding personal sacrifice, and actively participated in the relocation of over a hundred privately-owned factories from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Nanjing to the interior. He led the way in relocating all his enterprises to the interior. During the relocation, facing countless hardships, Comrade Hu's Changcheng Brick and Tile Factory and Xinmin Xiang Factory were nearly destroyed. However, he disregarded personal losses, focusing instead on the needs of the nation and people, dedicating himself to relocating 146 factories, 14,800 tons of materials, and over 2,500 technical personnel and workers to the rear. Under his and other patriotic entrepreneurs' efforts, these human and material resources became the backbone of the national industry in the rear during the war of resistance, playing a crucial role in military and civilian production and supply. Undoubtedly, this is a glorious chapter in the history of China's patriotic industrial and commercial circles and a shining page in China's war of resistance.

In the later stages of the war of resistance and after the victory, the Chinese people faced a critical juncture in the struggle between democratic forces and authoritarian rule. Comrade Hu valued the future of the nation over personal gains and losses, resolutely joining the democratic movement. He and Huang Yanpei initiated the establishment of the China Democratic National Construction Association, uniting patriotic industrial and commercial figures and connected intellectuals, collaborating with the Communist Party of China to fight for a peaceful, democratic, unified, and prosperous new China.

After liberation, Comrade Hu, with great enthusiasm, threw himself into the construction of New China. He enthusiastically organized his peers in the industrial and commercial circles to study the policies of the Party and the government, writing articles and giving speeches to promote the Common Program, encouraging his peers to be patriotic, law-abiding, and actively develop production. He actively contributed to national construction, proposing a case related to industrial standardization at the first session of the second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which received attention from the government. Subsequent decades of practice proved that the implementation of standardization was of great significance to China's industrialization and modernization. In 1952, as the deputy leader of the Chinese People's Delegation to North Korea, he personally visited the front lines of the Korean War to visit the brave volunteer soldiers. What he saw and heard deeply moved him. Upon his return, he told others that in the midst of the gunfire, he truly understood the essence of internationalism and patriotism, deeply feeling the strength of the people, the selflessness of the working class, and the realization that without the leadership of the Communist Party, our nation would not have been able to break free from imperialist oppression and achieve true independence. Soon after his return, the Communist Party of China proposed the general line for the transitional period. At this time, Comrade Hu, facing the test of socialist transformation, was fearless and welcomed it with enthusiasm. He firmly believed that the socialist path guided by the Party was the right path. He collaborated with the government, taking the lead in implementing public-private joint management in his own enterprises and conducting extensive propaganda and education among his peers in the industrial and commercial circles, sharing his understanding and insights on socialist transformation, and helping everyone actively participate in this national and personal beneficial cause. Comrade Hu had always been highly respected in the industrial and commercial circles, and his actions had a significant demonstrative effect.

Reviewing Comrade Hu's life, one can clearly see that the path he took represented the inevitable development trend of the patriotic thoughts of the Chinese national bourgeoisie, that is, from industrial salvation to socialist salvation. Patriotism is not the same as socialism, but in the specific conditions of our country, patriotism is the path to socialism. Those who have different views on socialism, as long as they are patriotic, are good friends and can advance together. This is an important enlightenment left to us by Comrade Hu's life journey.

A Model in Implementing the Line of the Communist Party of China

In the latter half of his life, Comrade Hu collaborated with the Communist Party of China for a long time, forging a deep bond of shared hardships. He loved the Party, and after assuming leadership positions in the China Democratic National Construction Association and national leadership, he even more seriously implemented the Party's line, principles, and policies, making outstanding contributions to the progress and development of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the country.

Speaking of Comrade Hu's initial recognition of the Communist Party of China, it was purely coincidental. In 1932, Comrade Hu and a group of industrial and educational figures, at the invitation of General Yang Huicheng, the then governor of Shaanxi Province, went to the Northwest for a survey and to plan the development of the Northwest. The survey team was protected by General Yang's troops along the way. The locals, seeing the soldiers, habitually hid. Once, the survey team found a few villagers, and Comrade Hu took out the food he had brought, eating and chatting with them. During the conversation, the villagers insisted that Comrade Hu and his party were the Red Army, otherwise they would not be so good to the locals. Comrade Hu was greatly surprised. He then realized that the Communist Party, which was propagandized by the Nationalists as "communal property and communal wives" and "murderous demons," was actually so beloved by the people. A few years later, he met his old friend Fan Changjiang. Fan, as a reporter for the Daguangbao, had just returned from a visit to Yan'an. He also introduced to Comrade Hu the integrity and cleanliness of the Communist Party, the well-being of the people in the liberated areas, and the high morale of the anti-Japanese resistance. Comrade Hu could not help but admire them. At this time, his factory manager, Zheng Han-tao, expressed his desire to go to the liberated areas. Comrade Hu fully supported him and, upon his departure, presented him with a poem expressing his admiration for the Communist Party:

"The world is in chaos, but the Northwest is bright with hope.
In the Southeast, there is Zheng Han-tao, whose inner strength is as bright as his outer appearance.
My heart yearns for it, and I am not afraid of danger and hardship.
Brave is the vow to endure hardship for the country, forgetting one's family.
Resolute, do not fall, sowing melons to reap melons."

In 1945, in Chongqing, he had the opportunity to meet Zhou Enlai, Dong Biwu, Wang Ruofei, and Deng Yingchao, leaders of the Communist Party of China, and listened to their analysis of the situation in China and the world, and their explanation of the Party's national construction principles and policies, forging a friendship with them. He particularly admired Comrade Mao Zedong's courage in risking his life to go to Chongqing to negotiate with Chiang Kai-shek and his high sense of responsibility to the people and the nation. Once, he directly asked Chairman Mao: The war of resistance has ended, now we need to build a peaceful nation, why does the Communist Party still need to maintain its own army? Chairman Mao explained to him the logic that without the people's army, the rights of the people could not be guaranteed. He said that Chairman Mao's words greatly opened his mind and left a particularly deep impression. The open-mindedness, modesty, and pragmatic spirit of the Communist Party members made him further believe that the Communist Party was truly for the people and loyal to the nation; the Communist Party's insistence on peaceful and democratic national construction principles fully expressed his inner wishes.

After this, in the decades of contact and cooperation with the Communist Party of China, countless facts made him increasingly firm in his belief in following the Communist Party.

Regarding the acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party, according to Comrade Hu's own account, he also went through a process of understanding. A few years ago, Comrade Hu told me a long story. He said, I am a stubborn person, no one should think they can pressure me with authority, I don't buy that, so my acceptance of the leadership of the Communist Party is not arbitrary, it can be said that it is the conclusion I drew from my own experiences over the decades. I was born in the year of the Horse, and for half my life, I have suffered from internal strife and external aggression, and from the fragmentation and disunity of the nation. The bitter experience taught me that as long as there is internal strife, external aggression will inevitably come. After countless hardships, relying on the correct leadership of the Communist Party, a unified, independent, and proud socialist New China was established. In the early days of liberation, my understanding of the leadership of the Communist Party was somewhat simplistic, thinking that "whatever the Party says, I will do," and I didn't need to think too much. I also thought that the Party was always right, and every Party member was brilliant and infallible. Later, I gradually saw that the Communist Party was not always right and made mistakes, and Party members, being numerous, could not be generalized. Although the proportion of bad or turned bad members was very small, they did exist. This situation caused me inner conflicts and sometimes even pain and anxiety. After much thought, I thought I understood. I realized that the Communist Party is also a party, and the Communist Party is also made up of people, all living in reality, doing things that previous generations had not done. If they made no mistakes and had no bad Party members, that would be strange, that would be an illusion. Comrade Zhou Enlai is the most respected and admired Communist Party member I have ever met. I can say that I admire him to the core. Once, in a conversation with him, I mentioned the above problem. Completely to my surprise, he talked about the mistakes he had made in his career, and he also told me that he came from a scholar-official family, received feudal and capitalist education, and was once influenced by foreign ideas, thinking that everything new was good. It was only through long-term revolutionary struggles, through correcting mistakes and transforming thoughts, that he gradually changed. Comrade Zhou Enlai's words not only did not make me doubt the leadership of the Communist Party or waver, but instead made my understanding and belief more solid and firm. In summary, there are a few points. First, from Old China to New China, the Chinese people have relied on the leadership of the Communist Party to stand up. Building New China without the leadership of the Communist Party would definitely not be successful. Second, it is impossible for the Communist Party to make no mistakes, the key is how it deals with mistakes, whether it recognizes them seriously and corrects them seriously. Third, the words and deeds of Comrade Zhou Enlai and his kind reflect the essence of the Communist Party. With the insistence on dealing with mistakes in a realistic manner, my confidence in the Communist Party can only be strengthened and not weakened. Comrade Hu also said that to seriously deal with the mistakes made, it mainly depends on the Communist Party itself, but as someone who has gone through hardships with the Party for a long time, we also have the responsibility to help as much as we can, to speak out without reservation, and to truly achieve mutual trust and shared honor and disgrace. Comrade Hu said this and did it.

For example, in December 1981, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China convened the National United Front Work Conference. Comrade Hu and Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce Hu Ziqian discussed and believed that this conference was significant and could not be silent just because it was an internal Party conference. After discussion, the two "Hu" elders jointly wrote a letter to General Secretary Hu Yaobang and Premier Zhao Ziyang. The letter mainly raised four issues and opinions. First, it proposed the requirement to "strengthen the re-education of united front theory and policy, eliminate the influence of 'leftist' poison, and improve the effectiveness of united front work." Second, it pointed out that "respecting and listening to the opinions of representatives from all sides must be institutionalized and regularized, otherwise it often turns into a brief flash or formalism." Third, it believed that "the Central Committee and the State Council's determination and will to implement policies are evident to all; however, the broad masses' concerns about policy implementation are not without factual basis." Therefore, Comrade Hu and others proposed the "democratization of policy implementation work," believing that "fully utilizing and organizing the forces of democratic parties and people's organizations (naturally, the power of people's representatives and political consultants would be even greater) to work together with the Party and government leadership departments and personnel would be more effective than relying solely on the leaders' hard work in issuing instructions." Fourth, it demanded to solve the problems that democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce urgently need but can easily solve in terms of working conditions, and for this purpose, briefly proposed three suggestions. Comrade Hu's letter attracted the high attention of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In his speech at the closing of the National United Front Work Conference, General Secretary Hu Yaobang highly praised the opinions of Comrade Hu and others, saying that the conference "elicited a good opinion from the two elders, Hu Jiewen and Hu Ziqian." In his speech, he affirmed the four issues and specific suggestions raised by the two "Hu" elders multiple times.

Strict Self-Discipline and Keeping Pace with the Times

Comrade Hu was a highly respected elder in the China Democratic National Construction Association, but he never relaxed his efforts to improve and elevate his thoughts, always emphasizing moral cultivation, strictly demanding of himself, and keeping pace with the times, leaving us with many good virtues to learn from and remember.

Comrade Hu was a person who clearly distinguished right from wrong. He genuinely admired and cherished the leaders and warriors who selflessly dedicated themselves to the liberation of the Chinese people and the cause of socialism. In his poetry collection, there are laments for the deceased, songs of praise for the volunteer soldiers, and praises for the working people, but there are no flattering works for the ruling villains. After the passing of Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Hu wept for the loss of his first and best friend, composing three poems to express his grief. In the poems, there are lines such as "I am not the one to die, the talented ones perish first. I regret not being able to take his place, and I am deeply saddened for the nation." He sent the poems to the funeral office, and the staff wept after reading them. After the passing of Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Hu grew his beard again to show his determination to fulfill their wish to realize the Four Modernizations. For the "Gang of Four," who abused power and brought disaster to the nation, he held great contempt. During the height of the "Gang of Four's" power, he privately referred to Zhang Chunqiao as "Siao Deyi" from the play "The White-Haired Girl." Those who worked with him were both worried for him and admired his hatred of evil.

Those who had worked with Comrade Hu were all moved by his integrity and frugality, never putting personal interests above public benefit. In 1965, Comrade Hu was transferred to Beijing to lead the China Democratic National Construction Association, and later assumed national leadership positions. For a long time, he had no children by his side. The organization, considering his advanced age, repeatedly urged him to bring a child to Beijing, and he reluctantly agreed. After much thought, he proposed to bring the couple Hu Shiquan, who had only one child. He believed that children from large families would add to the organization's difficulties in arranging work; his living conditions were relatively good, and having another grandchild by his side might give the children a bad influence of "privileged upbringing," which was worth noting. Comrade Hu's home was simply furnished with old items. Relevant department officials repeatedly proposed to change them, but he always said, "It's fine, it's fine. Don't waste it." Comrade Hu had very strict requirements for his children. He said, I only support my children until they graduate from university, after graduation, they rely on themselves. He never spoke for his children's personal favors, believing that indulging children was tantamount to ruining them. Someone said, if our cadres were all as clean and public-spirited as Comrade Hu, the Four Modernizations would not be a worry.

Comrade Hu was good at recognizing talent. He often emphasized that the task of a leader was mainly to use people and administer. While handling affairs is important, using people appropriately is the primary responsibility of a leader, and one should not just handle affairs without managing people. If one abuses power to appoint personal followers, then one is not fit to be a leader. He served in leadership positions in the China Democratic National Construction Association for a long time, but never appointed a personal follower. He often told everyone that the art of using people is to insist on the standard of both virtue and talent, and first of all, one must look at virtue. He said that virtue mainly means distinguishing between public and private interests. Those who are dedicated to the public good can be used even if their abilities are somewhat lacking. Those whose public spirit is not strong, or even have private interests over public interests, even if they have talent, should not be heavily relied upon. Facing the serious problem of aging in the leadership teams inside and outside the China Democratic National Construction Association, Comrade Hu strongly advocated for the youthification of the cadre team. He said many times that in the issue of new and old replacement, old comrades should take the initiative with a public spirit and sincerely yield to the young. Only in this way can the young come up. He practiced what he preached and set an example. At the third session of the Fifth National People's Congress, Comrade Nie Rongzhen and a group of old comrades in the Party resigned from their vice-chairmanships. Comrade Hu believed that at 86 years old, his hearing was not good, and it was better to resign to make way for the young than to stay in position and affect work. He wrote a letter to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress requesting to resign. Considering the impact on all sides, the National People's Congress did not accept his resignation. His wish was realized at the seventh session of the National People's Congress last year. Comrade Hu also voluntarily resigned from the chairmanship of the China Democratic National Construction Association in 1987 and actively recommended new people, creating a good political influence inside and outside the association.

Comrade Hu was an optimist. This was not only related to his open-minded personality but also because he had a life philosophy of not believing in fate or destiny. Comrade Hu's life was full of ups and downs, but he never gave up. He believed that success depends on effort, and if one falls, one should get up and keep walking. During the Cultural Revolution, many people were pessimistic and discouraged. At that time, Comrade Hu was also affected, but he was very confident. He said, the Nationalists killed so many Communists, and the Communists did not collapse. Now, the Communists will not collapse either, and the country will definitely move forward. Comrade Hu was full of confidence in the future of the motherland. He said on many occasions that he wanted to live to 106 years old to personally see the new face of the motherland in 2001! Unfortunately, his last wish was not fulfilled. However, Comrade Hu's spirit will not die and will be with us, inspiring us to march towards the 21st century.

　　矢志为公　律己从严   
    ——深切怀念胡厥文同志
    孙起孟
    ４月１６日深夜，电话里传来胡厥文同志逝世的噩耗，我立即赶赴北京医院。站在厥老的卧榻前，凝望他安详如睡的模样，我竟不能相信，这位为国家民族的命运前途奋斗了近一个世纪、为振兴民族经济拚搏了７０年、领导中国民主建国会同中国共产党和全国人民风雨同舟战斗４０余年的爱国老人，会与我们长辞！一时间，他毕生惟勤惟敏，不怠不妄，为国为民的风范和业绩，都涌上心头。
    　　　　爱国工商界的杰出代表
    厥老出生于上个世纪末。那时的中国外受帝国主义列强的侵略和掠夺，内受封建主义的腐朽统治和盘剥，国家风雨飘摇，人民濒于绝境。许多志士仁人，在这种苦难中，多方寻求富国强民之路。厥老和不少同时代的人，认识到贫穷落后就要挨打这个基本事实，选择了“实业救国”的道路。难能可贵的是，他没有把自己禁锢在“实业救国”的理想里，而始终把自己的命运同国家民族的前途联系在一起，审时度势，顺应时代的潮流，不断前进，脚踏实地实践自己爱国、救国、建国的抱负。因而，他成为我国民族工商界的先进分子和带头人。
    ２６岁那年，厥老创办新民机器厂，开始了实业家的生涯。他办企业始终把个人的发展同富国利民联系在一起。他的口号是外国能造的，新民厂也能造。他热心于吸收先进技术，研制仿造新产品。他的产品以质量上乘、价格低廉而受到用户的欢迎。不上几年，他的企业从一个发展到五个，名噪一时。厥老没有满足于个人的成功，为了带动机器业同业的共同发展，他积极主张建立同业组织，以加强联系，互助合作。１９２７年，上海机器业同业工会成立，大家一致推举他作主任委员。后来连选连任长达十年之久。他在《机器同业公会竞赛会题句》一诗中，这样抒发了自己的理想与抱负：“国家盛歇基于工，惟勤惟敏我所崇。竞技有心在强族，夺标无意自私雄。精求益进程何限，炉锤锻出太平风。”
    １９３１年“９·１８”事变后，民族矛盾日益尖锐。厥老感到，国难当头，焉能安业？于是，他团结同业，积极投入救亡工作。淞沪抗战中，他动员、组织起几十家企业拆迁机器到沪南建立临时工场，赶制手榴弹、炮弹、地雷、水雷，支援前线守军。几十天里，他日夜奔忙，无暇理发剃须，竟至须髯盈颊，大家尊称他“胡子”。他索性蓄须以记国难，并且表示，要待抗战胜利了才剃。１９３７年，全面抗战开始后，他服从抗战需要，不顾个人牺牲，积极参与发起、组织江浙沪宁百余家民营工厂内迁的壮举。并带头把自己的所有企业迁往内地。内迁途上，千难万险，厥老的长城砖瓦厂和新民湘厂在迁移中损失殆尽。但他置私人利害于不顾，心里装的是国家民族的需要，全力扑在怎样把包括机械、造船、纺织、炼钢、化工等行业１４６家工厂、１．４８万吨物资和２５００多名技术人员和工人迁到后方上。在他和不少爱国企业家的共同努力下，这些人力、物力资源，成为抗战时期后方民族工业的中坚力量，在军需民用的生产供应方面，发挥了重要作用。毫无疑问，这是中国爱国工商界的光荣，也是我国抗战史上的光辉一页。
    抗战后期以至胜利结束后，我国人民又面临人民民主力量同专制独裁势力进行决战的严峻关头。厥老看重的也是国家的前途而不是个人的得失安危，毅然投身民主运动洪流。他和黄炎培等人发起组织中国民主建国会，团结爱国工商业家和有联系的知识分子，配合中国共产党，为建立和平、民主、统一、富强的新中国而斗争。
    解放以后，厥老怀着极其兴奋的心情投入新中国的建设。他热情地组织工商界同仁学习党和政府的方针、政策，写文章、作报告，宣传《共同纲领》，鼓励同业爱国守法、积极发展生产。他积极为国家建设出谋划策，在政协一届二次会议上，他提出有关工业标准化的提案，受到政府的重视。以后几十年的实践证明，实行标准化对于我国的工业化和现代化是具有重要影响的。１９５２年，他作为祖国人民赴朝慰问团总团副团长，亲赴朝鲜前线，看望英勇战斗的志愿军，所见所闻，使他受到极大的震动。回国后，他曾对人说，在炮火纷飞中，我才体会到国际主义和爱国主义的真谛，深感人民力量的强大，深感工人阶级的大公无私，深感没有共产党的领导，我们国家就不可能摆脱帝国主义的压迫，获得真正的独立。他回国后不久，中国共产党提出了过渡时期总路线，此时的厥老，面对社会主义改造的考验，已毫无惧怕，而是热忱欢迎了。他坚信，党所指引的社会主义道路，是康庄大道。他配合政府，率先在自己的企业实行公私合营，并且在工商界同仁中，作了大量的宣传、教育工作，介绍自己对于社会主义改造的体会、认识，帮助大家主动参加这桩利国利己的事业。厥老在工商界中向来威信很高，他的言行在工商界中起了很大的示范作用。
    回顾厥老一生，可以清楚地看到，他所走过的道路，代表了中国民族资产阶级爱国主义思想的必然发展趋势，这就是从实业救国向着社会主义救国升华。爱国主义不等于社会主义，可是，在我国的具体条件下，爱国主义又是走向社会主义的甬道。对于社会主义有这样那样不同看法的人，只要爱国，就是好朋友，就可以携手前进。这是厥老的生活道路留给我们的一点极为重要的启迪。
    　　　　执行中国共产党路线的模范
    厥老在他的后半生，同中国共产党长期合作，结下了患难与共的战友关系。他热爱党，在他担任民建领导职务和国家领导职务以后，更加认真地执行党的路线、方针、政策，为民建和国家的进步与发展，作出了卓越的贡献。
    说到厥老开始认识中国共产党，却是完全出于偶然。１９３２年，厥老和一批实业界、教育界人士应当时的陕西省主席杨虎城将军的邀请到西北考察，谋划西北的开发。考察团一路有杨将军的部队保护。老百姓见到军队习惯地东躲西藏。一次，考察团找到几个老乡，厥老便拿出所带食品，与他们边吃边聊。交谈之间，老乡坚称厥老一行人是红军，不然不会对老百姓这样好。厥老大为吃惊。始知被国民党宣传为“共产共妻”、“杀人魔头”的共产党，原来这样受百姓拥戴。几年后，他遇老友范长江。范作为大公报记者，刚刚到延安采访归来。他也向厥老介绍共产党的清正廉洁、解放区人民的安居乐业和高昂的抗日情绪。厥老不禁心向往之。这时，他的长城砖瓦厂工务主任郑汉涛表示想去解放区，他十分支持，临走赠诗一首，表达了他对共产党的敬佩心情：
    “世事乱如麻，西北生彩霞。
    东南有郑子，内实而外华。
    心焉向往之，不惮险且赊。
    壮哉誓茹苦，为国以忘家。
    志哉勿自堕，种瓜以得瓜。”
    １９４５年，他在重庆，有机会见到周恩来，董必武、王若飞、邓颖超等中共领导人，听他们分析中国和世界的形势，讲解党的建国方针和政策，同他们结下友情。他特别钦佩毛泽东同志不顾个人安危赴重庆与蒋介石谈判的胆略和对人民对国家的高度负责精神。有一次，他当面向毛主席直问：抗战已结束，现在要和平建国，共产党为什么还要保持自己的军队？毛主席向他讲了没有人民的军队，就不能保障人民的权利的道理。他说，毛主席这段话大大地使他开了心窍，留下了特别深刻的印象。共产党人的坦荡胸怀、平易谦和和实事求是的精神，使他进一步相信，共产党确是一心为人民的，忠于国家的；共产党所坚持的和平民主的建国主张，正好表达了他的内心意愿。
    这以后，在长达几十年同中共的接触与合作中，无数事实使他愈来愈加坚定了跟着共产党走的信念。
    关于接受共产党的领导，据厥老自述，在认识上也经历了一个发展过程。几年前，厥老对我说了很长一番话。他说，我这个人，秉性倔强，谁都不要想靠权势压我，我不吃这一套，所以我接受共产党的领导，不是平白无故的，可以说是我自己总结几十年亲身经历得出的结论。我生于甲午，半辈子吃尽了内乱外侮的苦头，吃尽了国家四分五裂、一盘散沙的苦头。惨痛的经验告诉我，只要有内乱，外侮就迟早要来。经过千辛万苦，依靠共产党的正确的领导，才建立统一的、独立的、叫人扬眉吐气的社会主义新中国。解放初期，我对共产党的领导，在理解上确有些简单化，以为“党怎么说，我就怎么做”，自己不需要动多大脑筋。我还以为，党总是正确的，党员个个高明，不犯错误。后来慢慢看到共产党并非一贯正确，也犯错误，党员人数众多，更不可一概而论，不好的或者由好变坏的虽占比重很小，但是确然有。这种情况在我心上引起矛盾，有时甚至感到痛苦不安。经过左思右想，我自以为想通了。我认识到，共产党也是个党，共产党也是人，都生存在现实社会里，干的是前人没有干过的事，如果一点错误不犯，一个不好的党员都没有，那倒是怪事，那倒是假象。周恩来总理是我所接触中最为我敬重钦佩的一个共产党员。对他，我可以说是钦佩得五体投地。有一次和他交谈中说到了上述的问题。完全出乎我的意外，他谈了他经历中犯过的这样那样的错误，他还告诉我，他出身于士大夫家庭，受过封建教育和资本主义教育，也曾沾上洋气，以为凡是新的都好，是在长期革命斗争中经过改正错误、改造思想的努力才逐渐转变过来的。周总理的谈话不仅没有使我对共产党的领导产生怀疑，发生动摇，反而使我的理解和信念更加扎实、更加坚定了。归结起来，是这么几点。一、从旧中国到新中国，中国人民是依靠共产党的领导才翻了身的，建设新中国，没有共产党的领导一定搞不好、搞不成。二、共产党一点错误都不犯不可能，要求它少犯、不重犯，关键在于它对待错误怎么样，是否认真认识，是否认真改正。三、周总理这样一类党员的言和行反映了共产党的本质，有了坚持实事求是地对待错误这一条，我对共产党的信心只有加强而不会减弱。厥老还说，认真对待所犯错误，主要当然靠共产党自己，但作为与党长期共过患难的我们，也有尽力帮助的责任，要知无不言，言无不尽，真正做到肝胆相照，荣辱与共。胡厥老是这么说的，也是这么做的。
    比如，１９８１年１２月，中共中央召开全国统战工作会议。胡厥老和全国工商联主席胡子昂等负责同志商量，认为这次会议意义重要，不能因为是中共党内会议不提意见。经过讨论，两位“胡老”联名致函胡耀邦总书记和赵紫阳总理。信中主要提出四个问题和意见。一是提出“加强统战理论、政策的再教育，确定肃清‘左’的流毒和影响，发挥和提高统战工作效益”的要求。二是指出“尊重和听取各方面代表人士的意见，必须做到经常化、制度化，否则往往流于一曝十寒或形式主义。三、认为“党中央和国务院对于落实政策的决心和毅力，是有目共睹的；然而，广大群众对于政策贯彻落实的担心，也并非没有事实的根据。”由此厥老等提出“落实政策工作的民主化问题”，认为“充分发挥和运用民主党派、人民团体的力量（把人民代表、政协委员的力量组织起来，自然更大）配合党政领导部门和人员共同努力，比请单靠领导同志的辛辛苦苦地批示，可能收效较宏。”四是要求解决民主党派、工商联在工作条件方面不难办到而又比较迫切的问题，并为此扼要地提出三点建议。厥老写的信，引起了中共中央的高度重视。胡耀邦总书记在全国统战工作会议结束时的讲话中一上来就对厥老等同志的信给予很高的评价，说道会议“引出了胡厥文、胡子昂两老的一篇好意见”。他在讲话时曾不止一次地肯定两位“胡老”提出的四个问题和具体建议。
    　　　　严以律己　与时俱进
    厥老在民建会内是德高望重的前辈，但他对自己的思想的改进和提高从不放松，而且一贯注重道德情操的修养，严格地要求自己，与时俱进，以磊落光明的一生，为我们留下了许多值得学习和纪念的好品德。
    厥老是一位是非爱憎分明的人。他由衷地敬佩和爱戴为中国人民解放事业和社会主义事业无私奉献的领袖和战士。他的诗集中，有对先贤的哀悼、有对志愿军战士的讴歌、有对劳动人民的颂赞，却看不到对当道奸佞的任何阿谀之作。周恩来同志逝世后，厥老为一生第一知己的逝世而痛哭，他吟诗三首以寄托哀思，诗中有“庸才我不死，俊杰尔先亡。恨不以身代，凄然为国伤”之句。他派人将诗送到治丧办公室，工作人员读毕为之泪落。周恩来、毛泽东先后逝世后，厥老重又蓄须，以示继承他们实现四个现代化遗愿的决心。对于仗势弄权、祸国殃民的“四人帮”，他十分鄙视。在“四人帮”气焰猖獗的时候，他就私下斥张春桥为“沙家浜”里的“刁德一”。在他身边工作的同志，既为他捏一把汗，又钦佩他的疾恶如仇。
    同厥老共过事的人，都为他廉洁俭朴、从不以私利而犯公益所感动。厥老１９６５年调到北京主持民建中央领导工作，以后又担任了国家领导人。很长时间里身边没有子女。组织上考虑他年事已高，再三劝他调一个子女来北京，他才勉强同意。他考虑许久，提出调只有一个孩子的胡世荃夫妇来。他认为人口多的子女，会给组织上增添安排工作的困难；自己这里生活条件比较好，多一个孙辈在身边，会不会使孩子们多受一些“养尊处优”的不良影响，值得注意。厥老家里陈设简单陈旧，有关部门的同志多次提出要给他换换，他都说：“蛮好，蛮好。不要浪费了。”厥老对子女要求极为严格。他说，我只供养子女大学毕业，毕业以后就一切靠自己。他从来没有为子女说过什么人情，他认为溺爱子女，无异于毁掉子女。有人讲，如果我们的干部都像厥老一样廉洁奉公，四化大业就不犯愁了。
    厥老知人善任。他多次强调领导者的任务不外用人与行政。处事固然重要，用人是否得当更是领导者的首要职责，切不可只管事而不管人。如果用人上弄权安插私人，那就根本不配当领导者。他在民建担任领导职务的时间很长，但从未任用过一个私人。他还常对大家说，用人之道，要坚持德、才兼顾的标准，而且首先要看德。他又说，所谓德，主要的是公私要分明。一心为公的人，能力差一点也可以用。公心不强，甚至私心盛于公心的人，即使有才，也重用不得。针对民建会内外领导班子老化的严重情况，厥老很强调干部队伍的年轻化。他不止一次说过，在新老交替的问题上，老同志要出以公心采取主动，诚心让贤。这样才益于使年轻人上来。他说到做到，以身作则。五届人大三次会议上，聂荣臻等一批党内老同志辞去了副委员长职务。厥老认为，自己已８６岁，听觉也不好了，与其在位而影响工作，不如辞去以让贤路。他给人大常委会写信请辞。考虑对各方面的影响，人大没有接受。他的这一愿望在去年的第七届人大会议上实现了。厥老还于１９８７年主动辞去了民建中央主席的职务，并积极推荐新人，在会内外产生了很好的政治影响。
    厥老是个乐天派。这不仅同他的性格豁达有关，更因为他具有不信天、不由命的人生观。厥老一生几经坎坷，但从不气馁。他认为谋事在人，跌倒了，爬起来再走就是了。在“文化大革命”期间，很多人悲观沮丧。那时，厥老也受到冲击，然而他却很有信心。他说，国民党当年杀了那么多共产党人，共产党也没有垮。现在，共产党也垮不了，国家总会前进的。厥老对祖国的前途是充满信心的。他在许多场合都讲过，我要活到１０６岁，亲眼看到２００１年祖国的新面貌！遗憾的是，他最后的这个愿望没有能够实现。但是，厥老的精神不死，并将与我们同在，鼓舞我们向着２１世纪迈进。
