King Hassan II of Morocco welcomes visiting heads of state at the airport. As he approaches the VIP lounge, he always holds a cup of fresh milk, inviting the guests to taste it. The heads of state usually take a sip of the milk and then pick a date from the tray to eat. Some eat while walking, while others hold a date in their hand.

Using fresh milk and dates to welcome foreign guests is a traditional custom in Morocco. It is said that the Prophet Muhammad had a habit of drinking a cup of fresh milk and eating seven dates for breakfast every day.

    摩国王用鲜奶和椰枣迎接元首
    哈桑二世国王在机场迎接各国元首的到来。当他走到机场贵宾室门前时，总是手端一杯鲜奶，请国宾品尝。各国元首们一般都得喝上一口奶，同时顺手从盘中拿一个椰枣吃，有的元首边走边吃，有的还拿着一个椰枣在手中。
    用鲜奶和椰枣迎国宾已是摩洛哥的传统风俗。据介绍，伊斯兰教始祖穆罕默德有一个习惯，他每天进早餐，要喝一杯鲜奶，吃７个椰枣。
