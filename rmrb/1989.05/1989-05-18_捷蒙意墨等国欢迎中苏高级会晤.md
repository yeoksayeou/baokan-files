Czechoslovakia, Mongolia, Italy, and Mexico Welcome High-Level Sino-Soviet Meeting

Yaksh: High-Level Sino-Soviet Meeting Has Far-Reaching Significance

BEIJING, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Czechoslovakian Communist Party General Secretary Yaksh said that Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Gorbachev's visit to China and his talks with Chinese leaders "is an event of far-reaching significance."

Yaksh made these remarks at a luncheon hosted by Romanian leader Ceausescu on May 17. Ceausescu arrived in Prague for a one-day working and friendly visit.

Yaksh also said that the normalization of relations between the two countries and the two parties is the result of this meeting. Czechoslovakia believes that these results will strengthen world peace and security.

Mongolia: Normalization of Sino-Soviet Relations Beneficial to Mongolian Security

ULAN BATOR, May 17 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian public opinion highly evaluates the high-level Sino-Soviet meeting.

The May 17 issue of the "Youth Truth" newspaper commented that the normalization of relations between the two great historical friends has great significance for Mongolia. The entry of Sino-Soviet relations into a new period is a major political event of exemplary and far-reaching significance for the overall health of the Asia-Pacific region.

The May 15 issue of Mongolian Television commented that the better the relations between the two great neighboring countries, the more secure and sustainable Mongolia's security and existence will be.

Italy: Ending a Thirty-Year Split

ROME, May 17 (People's Daily) -- Our correspondent Luo Jinbiao reports: Italian newspapers have prominently featured and extensively covered news about the Sino-Soviet summit, positively evaluating the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.

The "Evening Post" article said that Sino-Soviet reconciliation has been achieved, and Gorbachev and Deng Xiaoping formally announced the complete normalization of relations between the two countries and the two parties, ending the 30-year split of the Communist Party. The handshake between Deng Xiaoping and Gorbachev not only signifies a diplomatic rapprochement between the two largest countries on Earth but also delves into ideological issues. The two leaders of world communism have established the principle that Marxist-Leninist doctrine is no longer an unchanging dogma but must adapt to the times and circumstances.

The "Republic" article called it a historic embrace. For Gorbachev, Deng Xiaoping represents a double significance: an old communist warrior and the first reformer of communism. The past is buried, and from today onwards, relations between China and the Soviet Union, and between the two parties, are normalized.

Mexico: Marking the End of the Century with Peace

MEXICO CITY, May 17 (People's Daily) -- Our correspondent Guo Weicheng reports: Mexican public opinion has widely followed the Sino-Soviet meeting. The influential "Excelsior" newspaper today published an article by its columnist Julius from Beijing in the "World Affairs" column, saying that China's insistence on independence between the two superpowers has become a stabilizing factor in the world.

The article said: "The Sino-Soviet meeting has historical and far-reaching significance because it not only ends the 30-year confrontation and tension between the two socialist powers but also has an undeniable weight in the process of global détente, thus marking the end of the century with a sign of peace. The Sino-Soviet meeting is not like the meetings between the two superpowers that usually discuss global issues. More precisely, it is to achieve the normalization of relations between the two countries and to discuss certain regional issues in which they are respectively involved, particularly the Cambodian issue. Therefore, the Sino-Soviet talks can only be pragmatic and realistic."

The article pointed out: "The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will establish an important link in the triangular relationship between the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, which has been lacking so far. This objectively benefits the stability of the world."

　　捷蒙意墨等国欢迎中苏高级会晤
    雅克什：中苏高级会晤有深远意义
    新华社布拉格５月１７日电　捷共中央总书记雅克什说，苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫对中国的访问和他同中国领导人的会谈“是具有深远意义的事件”。
    雅克什是１７日在罗马尼亚领导人齐奥塞斯库举行的午宴上讲这番话的。齐奥塞斯库１７日抵达布拉格进行为期一天的工作友好访问。
    雅克什还说，苏中两国和两党关系正常化是这次会谈的成果，捷克斯洛伐克相信这些成果将加强世界和平与安全。
    蒙古：中苏关系正常有利蒙古安全
    新华社乌兰巴托５月１７日电　蒙古舆论高度评价中苏高级会晤。
    《青年真理报》１７日发表评论说，我们两个历史悠久的伟大朋友的关系正常化，对蒙古来说具有重大意义。苏中关系进入新时期是使亚太地区气氛全面健康化的具有榜样性和意义深远的重大政治事件。
    蒙古电视台１５日发表评论认为，两个伟大邻国的关系越好，蒙古的安全和生存就越能得到保障。
    意大利：结束了三十年的分裂状态
    本报罗马５月１７日电　记者罗晋标报道：意大利各报均以显著位置和大块篇幅刊登有关中苏首脑会晤的消息，积极评价中苏关系正常化。
    《晚邮报》文章说，中苏之间实现了历史性和解，戈尔巴乔夫和邓小平昨天正式宣告了中苏两国和两党之间关系完全正常化，这次会见结束了共产党３０年的分裂。邓小平和戈尔巴乔夫之间的握手不仅意味着地球上两个最大国家之间外交上的重新接近，而且深入到了意识形态问题。世界共产主义的两位领袖确立了这样一条原则：马列主义学说不再是一成不变的教条，而要适应时间和形势的变化。
    《共和国报》文章称这是历史性的拥抱。对戈尔巴乔夫来说，邓小平代表着双重意义：共产主义老战士和共产主义的第一个改革者。过去被埋葬了，从今天起，中苏不仅两国、而且两党之间的关系都正常化了。
    墨西哥：给本世纪末打上和平标志
    本报墨西哥城５月１７日电　记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥舆论广泛关注中苏会晤。墨西哥有影响的《至上报》今天在头版《世界时事》专栏发表该报专栏作家朱利奥斯发自北京的文章说，中国在两个超级大国间坚持独立，成为世界的稳定因素。
    文章说：“中苏会晤具有历史深远意义，因为不仅结束了两个社会主义强国之间长达３０年的对立与紧张状态，也在世界缓和进程中有着不可否认的份量，从而给本世纪末打上一个和平的标志。”“中苏会晤不像两个超级大国之间的会晤惯于讨论全球性问题。确切地说，是为了实现两国关系正常化并讨论它们分别卷入的某些地区问题，尤其是柬埔寨问题。因此，中苏之间的会谈只能是务实的及现实主义的。”
    文章指出：“中苏关系正常化将在美苏中三角关系中建立起一个重要的，至今仍然短缺的环节，这客观上有利于世界的稳定。”
