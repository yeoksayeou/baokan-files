In two worlds

—Reflections on Tibetan Culture

People's Daily reporter Lú Xiǎofēi

If you had the chance, like me, to travel across more than a million square kilometers of Tibetan land, you would have the opportunity to experience why, above the natural world that humans depend on for survival, there exists a world of gods. To me, it is a spiritual world that is both ethereal and real.

I had always assumed that those who enter the Buddhist world live quite comfortably in that realm of self-cultivation. In fact, many of the monks I have met do live this way. They often choose secluded, elegant places to live and cultivate themselves, unlike us ordinary people who endlessly create troubles for ourselves. I have had such experiences: in the morning, lying down at the foot of Mount Gang Rinpoche to watch the illusory reflections on the surface of Lake Manasarovar; at night, lying on the grasslands of Changtang to watch the arc of light from the Himalayas on the sky. At such times, I would feel a strange sense of detachment from the worldly. When I had to return to the city (Lhasa is no exception), the mundane constraints of this world would once again bind me, making me long for that mysterious world even more.

Perhaps I am naive.

It was not until September 27, 1987, that I realized the monks I respected were constantly holding rallies on Barkhor Square, shouting surprising political slogans, and staging such a political farce on the international stage. Only then did I understand. Tibetan Buddhism, as I had known it, differs fundamentally from the Buddhism I had known, namely the historical tradition of the fusion of politics and religion. This makes them unwilling to stay in the quiet world of the gods but also want to be involved in worldly affairs. Later, I met several monks who, because they failed to control both the human and divine worlds, were in great pain. Not to mention some monks who, in their attempt to control both the human and divine worlds, were quite self-righteous, many believers were also willing to do so.

Some people had thought that after 1959, when the history of several hundred years of the fusion of politics and religion in Tibet ended, humans and gods would each find their place. It was not until the recent unrest in Lhasa that people were reminded: in the hearts of many, the human and divine worlds are still intertwined.

I have thought about this for a long time: why does the Chinese nation have a unique cohesion? As a member of the Chinese nation, the Tibetan nationality also shows great national cohesion! In my years of pursuit on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, I discovered the charm of Tibetan culture. Tibetan culture, from the ancient Bon religion to the modern Gelugpa, can almost be said to be a continuous development, or "inheritance and development." It is this one-element culture that has united the local Tibetans and the Tibetan people in Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan, and has made them brothers with the Han culture, which is also a one-element culture.

Perhaps based on this thinking, when I traveled in various places in Tibet, I naturally merged myself into the atmosphere of Tibetan culture and felt at ease. I know a Beijing businessman who lives on Barkhor Street. He has been living here since 1947, married a Tibetan woman, and has become a genuine Lhasa resident. His descendants also regard themselves as true Tibetans.

I sat quietly in his home, drinking tea, but my mind was thinking, perhaps a hundred years later, no matter how much modern civilization is introduced here, this unique cultural atmosphere will not disappear. At that time, if people recall that their ancestors had created unrest in Lhasa for some inexplicable reasons, they will surely laugh.

There is a logical answer to this. That is, the form and solidity of this culture depend on the natural geography of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Some scholars in the world use the natural environment to explain the nature of a civilization, the social form, and the character of people. The author has also unconsciously joined this school of thought. However, in the case of Tibet, the natural environment here is not only an important condition for determining whether material wealth is abundant but also an important factor in determining people's aesthetic consciousness and ethical concepts. People are so close to nature that it is no wonder that scenes of the unity of heaven and man are often seen.

It is also because of this that, with material scarcity and surplus time, people have more energy to invest in religion and related architecture, painting, sculpture, and performing arts. I have patiently watched several Tibetan operas and listened to temple music. To be honest, I don't understand much. The experts in the capital say that it is absolutely modern. I myself am amazed by the high-pitched singing of Tibetan opera and the unaccompanied chorus of monks (chanting scriptures). Thinking carefully, all Tibetan arts are something beyond reality. When I saw the Potala Palace like a giant ship moored in the Lhasa Valley at an altitude of 3,700 meters, I could not help but marvel. At that time, I always wanted to tell my dear Tibetan brothers, do not easily deny yourself, and do not seek help from the mysterious world of saints. It is this vast land that nurtures the magical power of Tibetan culture. In this regard, all the concerns in the world that Tibetan culture will be "destroyed" due to China's modernization process are either unnecessary or have ulterior motives.

### 在两个世界之间——关于藏文化的遐想

　　在两个世界之间   
    ——关于藏文化的遐想
    本报记者  卢小飞
    假如你能像我一样，有机会在西藏一百多万平方公里的土地上游历，你也就有机会体味到，在人类赖以生存的自然之上，为什么会有一个神的世界。对我来说，它是一个缥缈而实在的精神世界。
    我一直以为进入佛门的人，在那个独善其身的世界里生活得相当自在。事实上，我见过的许多出家人确是如此。他们往往都选择那些幽雅的所在深居养性，绝不像我们这些凡夫俗子无穷尽地自寻烦恼。我也有过那种经历：清晨，伏在冈底斯山下看玛旁雍错湖面上泛起幻影；夜晚，枕在偏吉草原上看喜马拉雅雪墙在天幕上映出弧光。此时，便会生出摆脱世俗的那种奇妙感受。当我不得不回到都市（拉萨也不例外）的时候，凡胎俗骨无从摆脱的一切尘世的束缚再度缠身，于是便更加向往那个神秘的世界。
    也许我是幼稚的。
    直到１９８７年９月２７日以后，我所尊敬的僧侣们不断在八廓街广场飞行集会，高呼一些令人惊讶的政治口号，并将这样一出政治闹剧搬上了国际舞台，我这才顿悟。原来藏传佛教与我曾经认识的那个佛教有一个本质的不同，即政教合一的历史传统。这使他们不甘居于那个静寂的诸神世界，还要过问人间烟火。我后来相继接触过一些僧侣，他们由于希图主宰两个世界不成而痛苦异常。不要说一些出家人对主宰人、神两界自以为是，相当一些教民也甘愿于此。
    有人曾以为，自１９５９年结束了西藏几百年政教合一的历史之后，人、神各得其所。直到最近，拉萨动乱的现实才提醒了人们：在许多人心中，人与神的世界还交织在一起。
    我想过很久，中华民族为什么具有独特的凝聚力？作为中华民族一员的藏民族也同样表现了巨大的民族凝聚力！在青藏高原的多年追寻中，我发现了藏文化的魅力。藏文化从原始的苯教到近代黄教，几乎可以说是一脉相承，或叫“继承发展”。正是这种一元文化使西藏本土乃至青海、四川、甘肃、云南在内的大蕃民族凝聚起来，并同同样是一元文化的汉文化成为亲兄弟。
    大概基于此种思考，我在西藏各地旅行的时候，自然而然地将自己融合在藏文化的氛围里，感觉自如。我认识一位住在八廓街的北京商人，他从１９４７年开始就定居在这里，娶了藏女为妻，他本人也演变为一个地道的拉萨人。他的后代们也都以真正的西藏人自居。
    我在他家里默默地喝着茶，心里却在想，也许百年之后，无论这里引进了多少现代文明，这种独特的文化氛围也不会悄然散去。到那时，人们如果回忆起他们的祖先曾经因为一些莫名其妙的原因在拉萨不断制造骚乱，他们一定哑然失笑。
    这里有一个合乎逻辑的答案。即这种文化的形态及其牢固程度有赖于青藏高原的自然地理。世界上有一些学者用自然环境来说明某种文明的性质和社会形态以及人的性格，笔者也下意识地加入了这一学派。不过，就西藏来说，这里的自然环境不仅是决定物质财富是否丰富的重要条件，也是决定人的美学意识和伦理观念的重要因素。人离自然如此之近，难怪会不断见到天人合一的场景。
    也正由于此，物质匮乏而时间过剩，使人们有更多的精力去投入宗教及其有关的建筑、绘画、雕塑及歌舞等艺术之中。我曾经耐心地看过几出藏戏，听过寺庙音乐。老实说，我不大懂。京城的行家们称那绝对是现代派的东西，我自己也为藏戏高腔和僧侣们的无伴奏合唱（诵经）叫绝。细细想来，所有西藏艺术都是一种超乎现实的东西。当我看到布达拉宫像一艘巨轮停泊在海拔３７００米的拉萨河谷中时不得不叹为观止。这时候，我总想对我亲爱的藏族兄弟说，千万不要轻易地否定自己，更不要求诸冥冥世界的圣人。正是这块雄浑的土地，蕴孕出藏文化的神奇伟力。以此而论，世界上所有关于藏文化会因中国现代化进程而“被消灭”的担心都是多余的或者是别有用心的。
