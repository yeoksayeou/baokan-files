Italian club Napoli won the UEFA Cup last night after drawing 3-3 with Stuttgart in Stuttgart, West Germany. The first leg of the final, played 14 days earlier, saw Napoli defeat Stuttgart 2-1. World football star Diego Maradona played a crucial role in all three of Napoli's goals.

Napoli opened the scoring in the 19th minute. Allemão and Careca split the Stuttgart defense, and Maradona sent a long pass. Allemão received the ball and scored from close range, leaving the goalkeeper with no chance to save it. Just eight minutes later, Stuttgart's Jürgen Klinsmann equalized with a header from a corner kick by Sigurðsson, making the score 1-1. In the 40th minute, Maradona took a corner kick. The ball was cleared but landed in the air to the right of the goal, right in front of Maradona. He quickly moved forward and headed the ball to the left side of the goal, where Ferrara was positioned. Ferrara seized the opportunity and scored, making it 2-1 for Napoli. Napoli's third goal also came from Maradona's assist. In the 62nd minute of the second half, Maradona passed the ball to Careca, who was unmarked in front of the goal. Careca didn't hesitate and scored, making it 3-1. The most dramatic moment came in the 68th minute when Stuttgart's Giovanni De Napoli scored an own goal, turning the ball into his own net. Just before the final whistle, Stuttgart's Jürgen Klinsmann scored with a header, making the final score 3-3.

　　那不勒斯队获欧洲足球联盟杯    
    世界明星马拉多纳又有上乘表演
    本报波恩５月１８日电  记者江建国报道：意大利那不勒斯队昨晚在西德斯图加特同斯图加特队踢成３平。由于１４天前在决赛第一场中那不勒斯队以２∶１战胜斯图加特队，因此，那不勒斯队夺走了欧洲足球联盟杯。世界足球明星马拉多纳在３个球中都建立特殊功勋。
    那不勒斯队在开球第１９分钟首开对方大门。当时那队的阿勒马奥和卡雷卡在对方球门两侧分兵把口，马拉多纳一记长传，阿勒马奥接球后在距球门很近处射门，守门员已无机会扑球。仅仅８分钟后，斯图加特队西古尔文森发角球，克林斯曼反应迅速，从球门左侧一个头球打进对方大门，双方打成１∶１。踢到４０分钟时，马拉多纳得机会发角球，球被对方踢出后，恰恰飞到大门右侧半空，正在马拉多纳眼前，马拉多纳迅即抢前一步，只见他头一歪，把球传给大门左侧的费拉拉，费拉拉抓住战机一脚起射成功。那不勒斯队第３次得分仍然依靠了马拉多纳。在下半时６２分钟时，对方大门空虚，马拉多纳把球横传给卡雷卡，卡雷卡一丝一毫也没犹豫，起脚中的。场上比分形成３∶１。最富戏剧性的一幕是比赛进行到６８分钟时，斯图加特队高第诺射门，球落到那不勒斯队德那波里脚下，他一转身，竟把球带进了自家大门，为他人作了一件“嫁衣裳”。比赛结束哨音吹响前一刻，斯图加特队施多勒尔向下顶了一个头球进网，双方终以３∶３踢平。
