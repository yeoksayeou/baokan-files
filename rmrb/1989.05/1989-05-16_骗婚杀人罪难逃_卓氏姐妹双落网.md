The criminals Coq Rongzhen and Coq Rongqun, who committed fraudulent marriage, robbery, and murder in Liao Cheng City, Shandong Province on April 20, were recently captured in Guizhou.

On April 13, Coq Rongzhen, who resides in Guiyang City, and her cousin Coq Rongqun, who resides in Duyun City, conspired to go to Shandong to commit fraud. On April 18, under the planning of their accomplice Feng Lulin and his nephew Feng, they brought Coq Rongqun to the home of farmer Jin Xuewen in Liao Cheng. Coq Rongzhen proposed to sell Coq Rongqun to Jin Xuewen for 2,000 yuan as a "wife," and they set off firecrackers that night to "celebrate the marriage."

The next day, after the Coq sisters had obtained the money, Coq Rongqun attempted to escape but failed due to Jin Xuewen's tight security. Coq Rongqun then decided to kill Jin. That night, while Jin was asleep, she struck him on the head with an iron bar, killing him instantly, and then fled the scene.

On April 25, the Hebin Police Station of the Nanming District Public Security Bureau in Guiyang City received a notice from the Liao Cheng City Public Security Bureau to capture the criminals. They immediately dispatched police officers to assist in the capture, and that night, they apprehended Coq Rongzhen. The next day, with the assistance of the Duyun City Public Security Bureau, they captured Coq Rongqun, who was preparing to flee.
