Thousands of French workers marched in Paris today to demand that President Mitterrand intervene to reinstate 10 employees fired by Renault Automobile Company.

The marchers gathered in front of the Élysée Palace, where a 10-person delegation was allowed to enter the presidential residence to submit a petition signed by 160,000 people. A representative of the French General Confederation of Labor, which organized the demonstration, told the press that the petition "asks the President of the Republic to fulfill his duties as head of state and ensure that these 10 fired workers regain their jobs."
