	For the Peace of the People
	—Recalling Beijing Xiaopai Fang Hutong Security Chief Liu Yingchun
	Zhang Mingwang

	Few residents of the Xiaopai Fang area in Beijing's Chaoyangmen District do not recognize Liu Yingchun.

	Liu Yingchun is 78 years old this year. Since the day he retired in 1972, his left arm has worn a red armband: "Security Patrol."

	Liu Yingchun is an old man who does not know how to enjoy life. His six children are in various prestigious positions: three are in the military, one works in the procuratorate, one in foreign trade, and another is a design engineer at the Tianjin Automobile Manufacturing Plant. From the day he retired, he has not enjoyed his good fortune, instead patrolling the streets and alleys every day. Since 1977, he has been consecutively named an advanced security individual at the district and municipal levels 10 times, and a model party member 8 times.

	Old man Liu Yingchun does not just patrol every day; he also takes care of the five-guarantee households and helps educate young people. The five-guarantee elderly in this area say that when they fall ill, calling a doctor or buying meals, almost everything is taken care of by Liu Yingchun. In educating young people, Liu Yingchun is even more dedicated. When he first retired, there were 56 delinquent youth within his jurisdiction. In the summer evenings, Liu Yingchun would bring a small stool, find the delinquent youth, and talk to them for three or four hours at a time. Through long-term efforts, only one of the 56 delinquent youth reoffended.

	Someone jokingly asked old man Liu Yingchun, "What are you after?" He said, "I just want Xiaopai Fang to be safe."

	Because Liu Yingchun works diligently, some factories, schools, and military units have invited him to guard their gates, with considerable remuneration, but he has declined them all. He said, "I have never thought about making money. I like my current job."

　　为了人们的安宁    
    ——记北京小牌坊胡同治保主任刘英春
    张明旺
    住在北京朝阳门小牌坊地区的居民，不认识刘英春老人的寥寥无几。
    刘英春今年７８岁了，自１９７２年退休那天起，左臂就多了一个红色袖章：“治安值班”。
    刘英春是个不会享福的老人。他的６个孩子，３个在部队，１个在检察院，１个在外贸部门工作，另一个是天津汽车制造厂设计工程师。他从退休那天起有福不享，天天巡逻在大街小巷。１９７７年以来，他连续１０次被评为区、市级治安先进个人，８次评为区、市级模范党员。
    刘英春老人不光天天巡逻，还照顾五保户，帮助教育青少年。这个地区的五保老人反映，他们生病了，请医生、买饭，几乎全都被刘英春包了。教育青少年，刘英春更是尽心尽力。老人刚退休那阵子，管界内有５６名违法犯罪青少年。夏天的晚上，刘英春带上小方凳，把违法青少年找来谈心，一谈就是三四个小时。经过长期努力，５６名违法青少年中仅有一名重新犯罪。
    有人开玩笑问刘英春老人：“您图个啥？”他说：“只图牌坊地区的安全。”
    由于刘英春工作认真，一些工厂、学校、部队请他看门护院，还有可观的报酬，他一一谢绝了。他说：“我没想过赚钱，我喜欢现在的工作。”
