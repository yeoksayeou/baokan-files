As the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement approached, we were pleased to see that the intellectual community across the country was paying an unusual amount of attention to re-examining the May Fourth New Culture Movement. The themes revealed by the May Fourth Movement—tradition and change—remain the central issues that Chinese people are striving to address as they move towards a modern society. Now, the Shanxi People's Publishing House has published "Five-Four and Modern China – New Perspectives on Five-Four," a collection of essays by Chinese intellectuals who have comprehensively reviewed and reflected on the May Fourth Movement in honor of its 70th anniversary.

In recent years, during the "cultural fever," the "New Confucians" have gained prominence, and their arguments such as the "May Fourth Rupture Theory" and "Modernization is not the same as Westernization" have become hot topics in the current May Fourth discussions. In this collection, Bao Zunxin's "An Unfinished Metamorphosis – Reflections on 'May Fourth'" and Gao Likang's "May Fourth Enlightenment and Chinese Culture" provide scholarly rebuttals to these arguments. Bao Zunxin emphasizes that "traditional culture, as a whole, is a spiritual force that is inversely related to modernization and cannot meet the requirements of modernization"; "opposing tradition is a necessary logic for modernization and social change." Therefore, opposing tradition is not equivalent to cultural nihilism, and the achievements of the May Fourth Movement lie in its criticism of tradition and its transcendence of Confucius and Mencius. Gao Likang also opposes the view that the May Fourth Movement was a comprehensive or thorough cultural criticism movement against tradition. Through an analysis of the worldview of May Fourth intellectuals, his conclusion is that the May Fourth enlightenment scholars were far from being the steadfast anti-traditionalists depicted in some historical works. Their hesitation and confusion on the fundamental issue of tradition versus modernization indicate their separation from tradition in form but unity in spirit. The dualistic tendency in the worldview of the May Fourth intellectual elite further reflects the deep influence of tradition.

Indeed, the May Fourth Movement is an unfinished metamorphosis. Then, why did the New Culture Movement and the Enlightenment Movement fail to complete their historical missions? In recent years, there have been roughly two evaluations of this point: either salvation overshadowed enlightenment, or enlightenment itself was fragile and immature. This collection of "New Perspectives on Five-Four" takes the theme of examining the limitations of the May Fourth Movement, but it does not dwell on these views. Instead, it delves deeply into aspects that have not yet been noticed by people. In Jiang Yihua's essay "On the Conflict and Interaction Between the Peasant Movement and the Enlightenment Movement in Modern China," he discusses the previously overlooked relationship between the peasant movement and the enlightenment movement. From the perspective of reviewing Chinese revolutionary history, he believes that the enlightenment movement (or the entire modernization and modernization movement) and the peasant movement that have run through Chinese history are "different in direction, goals, forms, and methods of movement," that is, two historical currents of different natures. Regarding the reasons for the failure of the May Fourth enlightenment, Zhang Jingru's explanation in "Errors in Haste – On the Flaws of the May Fourth Spirit" is: the hasty behavior and the attitude of seizing the moment, although it created the grandeur of the May Fourth Movement, also led to errors in haste. The lesson of the May Fourth Movement seems to remind people, "be steady, there are only benefits and no drawbacks." It is also worth mentioning that in Xie Xuanjun's "Seventy Years of Anti-Traditionalism – A Basic Line of Modern Chinese History," not only does he summarize the past seventy years of the May Fourth Movement as seventy years of the ups and downs of anti-traditionalism, but he also systematically analyzes the consequences of this. In his view, anti-traditionalism has not achieved its original goal: to quickly lead China onto the path of modernization. On the contrary, in some aspects, by destroying the basic pillars of China's social and cultural structure and failing to produce effective and suitable substitutes to fill the vacuum, Chinese society has fallen into a state of endless internal turmoil due to the lack of norms and the collapse of frameworks. Xie Xuanjun also boldly predicts: if the mainstream of China's modernization process so far has been "absorbing Western culture," then in the future, it should be "digesting Western culture." "Anti-traditionalism and neo-nationalism will gradually merge in the historical process."

The essence of the May Fourth New Culture Movement is democracy and science. To discuss the May Fourth Movement while avoiding democracy and science is almost impossible. In this collection, Huang Keshan's "A Brief Discussion on the Cultural Orientation of 'May Fourth'" and Huang Zhizheng's "The Dual Trajectory of the May Fourth Scientific Trend" delve into a deep analysis of democracy and science. The former believes that using "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science" as symbols of the May Fourth Movement seems insufficient. Instead, one should seek the deeper intentions of the May Fourth youth in the content of democracy and science advocated by the May Fourth intellectual elite. Perhaps summarizing the new cultural foundation of the mainstream intellectuals of the May Fourth Movement as "freedom as the essence, democracy and science as the means" can better grasp their cultural value system that takes the individual as the ultimate value orientation. The latter points out that in the May Fourth scientific and democratic trends, the modern science developed in the West began to be fully recognized by the Chinese. This recognition is manifested in the transplantation of scientific ontology into China and the affirmation of science as an independent new cultural form. However, under the influence of the social transformation requirements at that time and the traditional consciousness that had not been broken in the depths of the intellectuals' minds, science was also guided towards a theory and method of social revolution. This had a significant impact on the subsequent development of science in China. This is the dual trajectory experienced by the May Fourth scientific trend: one is the scientism formed during the May Fourth period; the other is the traditional Chinese academic thought that emphasizes society and life, making science only obtain the status of practical technology and only having utilitarian significance.

At present, as our country is undergoing profound changes, re-examining and evaluating the cultural value of the May Fourth Movement is obviously not just an academic issue in the study, but a highly contemporary theoretical topic. The publication of this collection will be beneficial for those who care about our country's modernization and the development of national culture to further explore and reflect.

　　《五四与现代中国——五四新论》读后
    马学新
    当五四运动７０周年的时候，我们高兴地看到，全国知识界以一种异乎寻常的关注来重新审视五四新文化运动。五四揭示的主题——传统与变革，迄今仍是迈向现代社会的中国人苦心求索的时代主题。现在山西人民出版社出版的这本《五四与现代中国——五四新论》，汇集了中国知识界为纪念五四７０周年而对五四所作的全面审视与思考。
    在最近几年“文化热”中，“新儒家”不胫而走，他们提出的“五四断裂说”、“现代化不等于西化”等论断，也成为目前五四讨论中争论的“热点”。在这本文集中，包遵信的《未完成的涅槃——对“五四”的反思》和高力克的《五四启蒙与中国文化》就对这些论断作了学理上的辩难。包遵信强调了“传统文化在总体上和现代化是一逆向的精神力量，无法适应现代化的要求”；“反传统是现代化与社会变革的必然逻辑”，因此反传统不仅不能等同于民族文化虚无主义，而且五四的成就正在于对传统的批判，对孔孟的超越。高力克也反对把五四称之为一场全盘性或彻底性反传统的文化批判运动。通过对五四知识分子世界观的透视，他的结论是：五四启蒙学者远不是某些历史著作所描绘的那种坚定不移的反传统主义者，他们在传统与现代化这一根本问题上所表现出的犹疑、徨惑，恰恰表明他们与传统的形离神合；五四知识精英世界观的二元论倾向更是折射出传统的深刻影响。
    确实，五四是未完成的涅槃。那么，新文化运动，启蒙运动为什么没有完成它们所负的历史使命呢？对于这一点，近些年大致有两种评价，或以为救亡压倒了启蒙，或以为启蒙自身脆弱而不成熟。这本《五四新论》以审视五四的局限为主题，但它没有纠缠于这些见解，而是从人们尚未加以注意的方面进行了深入的开掘。姜义华在《论农民运动与启蒙运动在现代中国的拮抗与对流》一文中，论述了以往人们忽略的农民运动与启蒙运动的关系。他从对中国革命历史回顾的角度，认为穿行在中国历史上的启蒙运动（或整个近代化现代化运动）和农民运动是“不同运动方向、运动目标、运动形式、运动方法”，也即不同运动性质的两种历史潮流。对于五四启蒙失败的原因，张静如在《忙中出错——论五四精神之弊》中的解释是：行为的匆忙，只争朝夕的态度，虽然造就了五四的轰轰烈烈，却也出错于忙中。五四的教训似乎对人叮嘱“稳一点，只有好处没有坏处”。还须提及的是，在谢选骏的《反传统主义的七十年——中国现代史的一个基本线索》中，不仅把五四迄今为止的七十年归结于反传统主义跌宕起伏的七十年，并对由此造成的后果进行了系统的分析。在他看来，反传统主义并没有达到它的原初目标：使中国迅速走上现代化的道路。相反在某些方面，由于摧毁了中国社会与文化结构的基本支柱，又一直未能产生有效而合适的替代品以补充其真空状态。这样，中国社会便因缺乏准则、框架解体而陷入内乱不已的境地。谢选骏还大胆地预测：如果说五四迄今中国现代化进程的主流是“吸收西方文化”，而今以后则应是“消化西方文化”，“反传统主义与新国粹主义将在历史进程中日益合一”。
    五四新文化运动的要义是民主与科学。讨论五四而欲回避民主与科学，可以说是不可能的。在这本文集中，黄克剑的《“五四”文化价值取向论略》和黄知正的《五四科学思潮的双重轨迹》，专就民主与科学进行了深入分析，前者以为把“德先生”和“赛先生”作为五四的象征符号似嫌不足，还应当从五四知识精英倡导的民主与科学的内容里去寻求五四新青年更深刻的用心，——或许把五四运动中主流知识分子的新文化底蕴概括为“以自由为体，以民主科学为用”，更能把握其以个人为本位、以自由为终极价值取向的文化价值系统。后者则指出，在五四科学和民主的思潮中，西方发展起来的近代科学开始得到中国人充分的认同，这种认同表现为科学本体的移植入中国和对科学作为一种独立的新型文化形态的肯定。但在中国当时的社会变革要求和知识分子心理深处并未打破的传统意识作用下，科学又被导向为一种社会革命的理论和方法，这对以后科学在中国的发展产生了很大的影响。这就是五四科学思潮所经历的双重轨迹；一是五四时期形成的科学主义；一是中国学术思想重社会人生的传统，使科学仍只获得实用技术的地位，只具有功利的意义。
    目前正当我国正在进行深刻变革的历史时刻，重新认识和评估五四的文化价值，显然不单纯是书斋里的学术问题，而是一个极富有时代感的理论课题。这个文集的出版，对于关心我国现代化和发展民族文化的人们进一步探索和反思将有所裨益。
