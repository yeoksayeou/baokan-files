The National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee today issued a statement regarding the U.S. House of Representatives' passage of a resolution on the so-called Tibet issue. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On May 16, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution on the so-called Tibet issue, grossly distorting the facts of the March riots in Lhasa and subsequent developments, slandering and attacking China for human rights violations in Tibet, and demanding that the U.S. administration intervene in China's Tibet affairs. This is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs by the U.S. House of Representatives, despite China's serious representations and protests, following the Senate's passage of a similar resolution on March 16. We strongly condemn this and protest to the U.S. House of Representatives.

The true nature of the events that took place in Lhasa in March has been fully exposed. The facts clearly show that this was not a matter of religion, ethnicity, or human rights, but a riot deliberately instigated by a handful of separatist elements aiming to split Tibet from China. The Chinese government's necessary measures to maintain national unity and ethnic solidarity, to uphold social order and the dignity of the law, and to safeguard the personal and property security of the Tibetan people, especially the residents of Lhasa, are within the sovereign rights of a state and fully in line with the interests and wishes of all ethnic groups in China, including the broad masses of the Tibetan people. We reiterate that the Tibet Autonomous Region is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China. Tibet's affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreign government, organization, legislature, or individual has the right to interfere. Any attempt to split Tibet from China will be resolutely opposed and condemned by the entire Chinese people, including the Tibetan people.

The U.S. House of Representatives' resolution slanders China for human rights violations in Tibet, which lacks even the most basic seriousness. It is well known that it was only 30 years ago that democratic reforms were implemented in Tibet, freeing the broad masses of Tibetan people from the inhumane shackles of serfdom and granting them unprecedented democratic freedoms and basic rights. With the flourishing development of Tibet's economy and cultural undertakings, and the further strengthening of socialist democracy and legal systems, the Tibetan people's rights and freedoms have become increasingly full and broad. Those separatist elements abroad who talk about human rights in Tibet are attempting to create unrest and, with the help of foreign forces, to split Tibet from China and restore the dark days of serfdom. Their activities not only seriously undermine Tibet's social stability, directly disrupting the Tibetan people's economic, cultural, and religious lives, but also fundamentally threaten the various basic rights that the broad masses of Tibetan people have only recently gained. Some members of the U.S. Congress claim to be concerned about "Tibetan human rights," yet they collude with these separatist elements. What are their true intentions?

Regarding negotiations with the Dalai Lama, the Chinese government's position is consistent and clear. As long as the Dalai Lama gives up his activities aimed at "independence" or quasi-independence, is willing to maintain national unity and promote ethnic solidarity, and contribute to the development of Tibet, we are willing to negotiate with him. Negotiations are a matter between the central government of China and the Dalai Lama, and we do not allow any foreign interference. We firmly oppose any attempt to internationalize the Tibet issue.

Developing Sino-U.S. relations is in the common interests and wishes of the peoples of both countries. The U.S. Congress's repeated interference in China's internal affairs under the pretext of the Tibet issue has seriously hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people and can only harm Sino-U.S. relations. We demand that the U.S. Congress, in the interests of maintaining friendly Sino-U.S. relations, stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

　　美国会众院就所谓西藏问题通过一项决议    
    人大外事委员会发表声明    
    抗议美国会又一次粗暴干涉我内政
    新华社北京５月１９日电  全国人大外事委员会今天就美国国会众议院就所谓西藏问题通过决议发表声明，全文如下：
    ５月１６日，美国国会众议院就所谓西藏问题通过一项决议，肆意歪曲３月份拉萨骚乱事件以及此后事态发展的真相，污蔑攻击中国在西藏侵犯人权，并要求美国行政当局插手中国西藏事务。这是美国国会不顾中国方面的严正交涉和抗议，继参议院今年３月１６日就所谓西藏问题通过决议后，又一次粗暴干涉我国内政的行为。我们对此表示强烈愤慨，并向美国国会众议院提出抗议。
    今年３月拉萨所发生的事件的真相，早已大白于天下。确凿事实表明，这不是什么宗教、民族和人权问题，而是少数分裂主义分子蓄意制造的骚乱，妄图把西藏从中国分裂出去的一场暴乱。中国政府采取必要措施，维护国家统一和民族团结，维护社会秩序和法律尊严，保障西藏人民特别是拉萨居民的人身、财产安全，是一个国家主权范围的事，完全符合全国各族人民包括西藏广大人民的利益和愿望。我们重申，西藏自治区是中华人民共和国不可分割的一部分，西藏的事务纯属中国内政，任何外国政府、组织、议会、个人都无权干涉；任何企图把西藏从中国分裂出去的活动，都将遭到包括西藏人民在内的全中国人民的坚决反对和谴责。
    美国国会众议院决议中污蔑中国在西藏侵犯人权，实在缺乏起码的严肃态度。众所周知，正是由于３０年前在西藏实行了民主改革，广大西藏人民才摆脱了惨无人道的农奴制枷锁，享受到前所未有的广泛民主、自由和各项基本权利。随着西藏经济建设和文化事业的蓬勃发展，随着社会主义民主和法制的进一步健全，西藏人民的各项权利和民主自由也越来越充分、越广泛。那些在国外侈谈人权的分裂主义分子企图通过制造骚乱和借助外国势力，把西藏从中国分裂出去，恢复黑暗的农奴制度。他们的活动，不仅严重危害了西藏的社会安定，直接破坏了西藏人民的经济、文化和宗教生活，而且还从根本上威胁着广大西藏人民好不容易才获得的各种基本权利。美国国会某些人口口声声说关心“西藏人权”，却和这少数分裂主义分子沆瀣一气，究竟是出于什么用心！
    关于同达赖喇嘛谈判问题，中国政府的态度是一贯的、明确的。只要达赖喇嘛放弃搞“独立”或变相独立的活动，愿意维护祖国统一和增进民族团结，为建设西藏作出贡献，我们就愿同他谈判。谈判是中国中央政府与达赖之间的事，不允许任何外国人插手。我们坚决反对把西藏问题国际化的任何活动。
    发展中美关系符合我们两国人民的共同利益和愿望。美国国会一再借西藏问题干涉中国内政，严重伤害了中国人民的民族感情，只能给中美关系带来损害。我们要求美国国会以维护中美友好关系这一大局为重，停止干涉中国内政的行动。
