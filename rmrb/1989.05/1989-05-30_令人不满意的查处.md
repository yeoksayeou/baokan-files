Dissatisfactory Investigation

On September 24, 1988, the fifth edition of this newspaper published a letter from a reader titled "There's a Trick to Reporting Lost Medicinal Materials," which exposed that on August 17, 1988, the Hunan Leiyang Pharmaceutical Company purchased a batch of fake thick bark and paid 17,000 yuan in cash without verifying the inventory. The letter also mentioned that this company had several instances of unreasonable reporting of lost medicinal materials. However, to this day, this newspaper has not received the handling decision from the Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company regarding this matter. Employees of the company have repeatedly written to this newspaper, reporting that relevant departments have not seriously investigated these issues. The reporter conducted an investigation into this matter.

On October 4, 1988, the Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company formed an investigation team. The investigation confirmed that the situation reported in the letter was true. The leadership of the Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company proposed handling opinions for the fake thick bark incident at a staff representative meeting: suggesting a fine of 50 yuan for the company's deputy manager Zhou Jin'an, who agreed to purchase this batch of thick bark; administrative warnings and a fine of 50 yuan for the company's deputy manager He Xiaofu, who agreed to purchase this batch of thick bark; administrative warnings and a fine of 100 yuan for the warehouse manager Liang Songlin; and a dismissal with a one-year probation period and a fine of 200 yuan for the direct responsible person Xie Zhengwen.

However, the staff representative meeting of the Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company did not agree with this handling opinion, and the employees had many discussions. They believed that this incident of purchasing fake thick bark not only caused economic losses to the company but also violated the drug management law. Returning the fake drugs to the supplier created a very bad influence in society. Therefore, it cannot be handled lightly. It should also be pointed out that the company had originally decided to stop purchasing thick bark to prevent fake drugs from entering the warehouse. However, the two deputy managers of the company still agreed to purchase this batch of thick bark. This deliberate act must be severely punished.

Purchasing fake thick bark only exposed one aspect of the chaotic management of this company. Some leaders of the Leiyang City Pharmaceutical Company could make a phone call or write a note to have relevant personnel purchase medicinal materials. In May 1988, the leaders of this company arbitrarily increased the purchase price of summer-withered grass. Within a few days, the entire company purchased a large amount of high-moisture summer-withered grass, causing it to accumulate and spoil, resulting in a loss of more than 100,000 yuan to the state. Surprisingly, this company, which deals with the purchase of traditional Chinese medicines almost every day, still only has 2 quality inspection personnel. Therefore, the company's purchase of unusable chicken-blood vine and fake caterpillar fungus had to be reported as losses, and so on. Due to the negligent management of the company's leaders, the company's first retail department experienced a theft incident.

During the investigation period, many employees of this company also reported to the reporter about the company leaders building private houses. This batch of company leaders took office in March 1987. Now, among the 5 managers and deputy managers of the company, 2 have already built houses, and the other 3 leaders are also hurriedly building houses. The public said that they have been in office for only two years, and each has built a house costing 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Some careful employees also calculated the family income of these leaders: among these leaders, the highest family income is only 300 to 400 yuan per month. They still have to support several people's lives. There are some people in the company who earn more than them, and many people have incomes equivalent to theirs, but these comrades not only do not think about building houses but also dare not even think about it. Some company leaders' building materials for their houses are even piled up with the materials for building the company's warehouse, and the construction is done by the same construction team. Some employees predicted that the warehouse would not be built, but their houses would be built.

The company's employees demand that the relevant higher-level departments seriously investigate the issues of the leaders of the Leiyang Pharmaceutical Company.

    令人不满意的查处
    本报记者  董纪新
    1988年9月24日，本报第五版刊登了《报损药材有名堂》的读者来信，披露了湖南耒阳医药公司1988年8月17日购进一批假厚朴，没等验收入库就支付现金1.7万多元的问题。来信还反映，这家公司还几次不合理的报损药材。但时至今日，本报一直未收到耒阳市医药公司对此事的处理决定，而公司的职工却多次向本报写信，反映有关部门没有严肃查处这些问题。记者就此事作了调查。
    1988年10月4日，耒阳市医药公司就组成了调查小组。经查，证实群众来信反映的情况属实。耒阳市医药公司领导人在职代会上提出了对假厚朴事件的处理意见：建议给予同意收购这批厚朴的公司副经理周金安罚款50元的处分；给予同意收购这批厚朴的公司副经理何孝福行政警告处分、罚款50元；给予公司仓库主任梁松林行政警告处分，罚款100元；给予直接责任者谢正文开除留用一年的处分并罚款200元。
    然而，耒阳市医药公司职代会不同意这一处理意见，广大职工也议论纷纷。他们认为，这次收购假厚朴事件，不仅给公司造成经济损失，还违背了药品管理法，将应该销毁的假药还给货主，在社会上造成了很坏的影响。因此，不能草草处理了事。还须指出的是，公司为防止假药入库，原先已经决定停收厚朴。可是，公司的两位副经理还是同意收购这批厚朴。这种明知故犯的做法，必须严加惩处。
    收购假厚朴，只是暴露了这家公司管理混乱的一个侧面。耒阳市医药公司某些领导人只要打个电话或是批张条子，就让有关人员收购药材。1988年5月，这家公司领导人擅自提高收购夏枯草的价格，仅几天内全公司收购了大批高水份的夏枯草，造成夏枯草积压、变质，使国家损失10多万元。令人惊异的是，这个几乎天天要同收购中草药打交道的公司，到现在只有2名质量检验员。因此，公司收购的不能药用的鸡血藤和假冬虫夏草都只好报损，等等。由于公司领导人疏于管理，造成公司第一门市部发生被盗事件。
    在调查期间，这家公司许多职工还向记者反映了公司领导人建私房的问题。这批公司领导人是1987年3月上任的。现在公司5位正副经理中，有2位已经建起了楼房，其他3位领导人也都在加紧建房。群众说，他们上任才两年，每人就营建了一幢楼房，造价达二三万元。一些细心的职工还为这些领导人的家庭收入算了一笔帐：在这几位领导人中，全家收入最高的，每月也不过三四百元。他们都还要负担几个人的生活。公司里有一些人比他们收入多，有不少人与他们的收入相当，可这些同志不要说建房，就是连想也不敢想。一些公司领导人建房时，他们的建房材料竟和建公司仓库的材料堆放在一起，施工又是同一个施工队。有的职工预言，仓库未建起来，他们的楼房就起来了。
    公司职工要求上级有关部门认真清查耒阳医药公司领导人的问题。
