In just three days (May 14), Argentina will hold its general election. In recent days, large-scale rallies and marches have been taking place from the capital to the interior. The various political parties participating in the election are launching Argentina's first power transition between two democratically elected governments in 38 years. For Argentines under the age of 56, this is an unprecedented experience. People are eagerly awaiting the vote with a mix of excitement and anxiety.

There are 12 political parties or coalitions fielding presidential candidates nationwide, but everyone knows the new president will emerge from the traditional two major parties—the ruling Radical Civic Union (Radical Party) and the Justice Party (which, along with several smaller parties, forms the People's Justice Front). The Radical Party's candidate is Governor of Córdoba Province, Angelos, while the Justice Party's candidate is Governor of La Rioja Province, Menem. If the focus of the election six years ago was on the transition from military rule to constitutional governance, with an emphasis on democracy, freedom, and human rights, this time the competition centers on the economy. Each party is promoting its economic platform, claiming that only its plan can help Argentina overcome its long-standing economic difficulties.

Since the debt crisis erupted in the early 1980s, Argentina, like other heavily indebted countries, has been undergoing economic adjustments to curb domestic consumption and sacrifice domestic growth in order to secure favorable repayment terms and resolve balance of payments issues. However, after several rounds of adjustments, the international balance of payments situation has not improved, while domestic funding shortages, production declines, and high inflation have become increasingly severe. What is the way out? The Justice Party and the Radical Party each have their own prescriptions. The Justice Party advocates a "production revolution," replacing a culture of speculation with a culture of production, and aims to stimulate domestic production by significantly increasing wages. It proposes that the income of the salaried class should account for more than 30% of the total national income, focusing on small and medium-sized enterprises, and using a legally binding social contract to coordinate the interests of various social strata. Regarding the external debt issue, the party believes that accepting adjustment plans dictated by creditor banks will only lead to recession and social instability. It advocates reaching an agreement with creditor banks to defer interest payments for a period, giving the country a chance to achieve growth, but clearly opposes the idea of defaulting on debt payments. The Radical Party's economic platform focuses on: fully implementing privatization, with the state withdrawing from direct production and service sectors; central bank independence, without overdrafts from the national treasury; implementing a single floating exchange rate, removing import restrictions, and orienting domestic production towards the international market; easing conditions for attracting foreign investment; improving income levels based on production development; and negotiating debt relief, but not stopping interest payments.

The current Radical Party government has a liberal bent, but its economic performance has been poor, putting the Radical Party candidate at a disadvantage. Although the Justice Party's proposals are not new, they align with the public's desire for change, making them more appealing to voters. Argentina uses an indirect election system, where the first round of voting is for electors, who then vote for the president. If a party secures more than half of the electoral votes in the first round, the second round becomes a formality. Most political analysts believe that the Justice Party will lead in the first round, but whether it can secure more than half of the votes is uncertain. If it cannot, the Radical Party may still defeat the Justice Party by forming alliances with other parties in the electoral college.

### 经济政策将决定选举胜负——写在阿根廷大选前夕

　　经济政策将决定选举胜负   
    ——写在阿根廷大选前夕
    本报记者  李志明
    再过三天（１４日），阿根廷就要举行大选了。连日来，从首都到内地，大规模的群众集会、游行不断。参加竞选的各政党正在发起阿根廷３８年来第一次在两届民选政府之间进行的政权交替。这对于５６岁以下的阿根廷人来说，还是生平头一遭。人们怀着新鲜而又焦躁的心情等待着投票。
    全国一共有１２个政党或政党联盟提出总统候选人参加竞选，然而人们都知道新总统将在传统的两大党——执政的激进公民联盟（激进党）和正义党（与几个小党组成人民正义阵线）中间产生。激进党的候选人是科尔多瓦省长安赫罗斯，正义党候选人是拉里奥哈省长梅内姆。如果说６年前的大选是从军人政府向宪制过渡，人们较多关心的是民主、自由、人权，那么这一次竞争的焦点是经济，各党都宣传只有自己的经济纲领才能使阿根廷摆脱延续多年的经济困境。
    ８０年代初，债务危机爆发以来，阿根廷同其他重债国一样，一直在进行经济调整，以抑制国内消费、牺牲国内增长来争取优惠的还债条件，解决国际收支的问题。然而几经调整的结果是国际收支状况不见好转，国内资金短缺、生产衰退、高通货膨胀却越来越严重。出路何在？正义党和激进党分别拿出了自己的处方。正义党提出一个“生产革命”的口号，即以生产文化取代投机文化，通过大幅度提高工资来刺激国内生产，主张工薪阶层的收入要占社会总收入的３０％以上，注重中小企业，通过一项有法律效力的社会契约来协调社会各阶层利益。关于外债问题，认为接受债权银行授意的调整方案只能导致衰退和社会不稳，主张同债权银行达成在一段时间内推迟付息的协议，以便国家有喘息机会来取得增长，但明确反对倒账（拒还债务本息）的主张。激进党的经济纲领重点是：彻底推行私有化，国家退出直接生产和服务的领域；中央银行独立，不向国家财政透支；实行单一浮动汇率，取消进口限制，国内生产要面向国际市场；放宽吸收外国投资条件；在生产发展的基础上提高收入水平；谈判减轻债务，但不停止付息。
    本届激进党政府带有自由派色彩，但在经济领域政绩不佳，使得激进党候选人处于不利地位。而正义党的主张虽然不是新东西，但符合人心思变心理，对选民来说似乎更有吸引力。阿根廷实行间接选举，第一轮投票是选选举人，然后由选举人投票选总统。如果第一轮中某党所得选举人票超过半数，那么第二轮就成为形式。多数政治分析家认为，正义党在第一轮中能够领先，但能否超过半数，还很难说，如果不能超过半数，激进党也可能联合其他党在选举人团中战胜正义党。
