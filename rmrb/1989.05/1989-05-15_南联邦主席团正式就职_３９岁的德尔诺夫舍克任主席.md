The new collective head of state of Yugoslavia, the Federal Presidency, officially took office today at a joint session of the two houses of the parliament.

The new members of the Presidency are Janez Drnovšek (Republic of Slovenia), Borisav Jović (Republic of Serbia), Dragutin Zelenović (Autonomous Province of Vojvodina), Stipe Šuvar (Republic of Croatia), Riza Sapundžiu (Autonomous Province of Kosovo), and Nenad Bućin (Republic of Montenegro). They were all elected either directly by voters or through secret ballots by representatives of the republics and autonomous provinces after multiple candidates were determined from the bottom up. The candidates from the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not secure the majority of votes from their respective republics' representatives, so the chairmen of the presidencies of these two republics will temporarily participate in the work of the Federal Presidency until new members are elected.

The new Presidency has a term of five years, and they officially took office after taking a solemn oath.

The average age of the six new members of this Presidency is 55 years, which is 11 years younger than the previous Presidency. The youngest, J. Drnovšek, is only 39 years old.

According to the predetermined rotation sequence, the Presidency elected Drnovšek as its chairman.

Local opinion believes that the new Presidency is starting its work in a more difficult situation than five years ago, and the tasks they face are by no means easy. The younger and more professional composition of its members has brought some hope to the people.

　　南联邦主席团正式就职    
    ３９岁的德尔诺夫舍克任主席
    本报贝尔格莱德５月１５日电  记者严正报道：南斯拉夫新的集体国家元首即联邦主席团今天在议会两院联席会议上宣布组成。
    新主席团成员是亚奈兹·德尔诺夫舍克（斯洛文尼亚共和国）、博里萨夫·约维奇（塞尔维亚共和国）、德拉古廷·泽莱诺维奇（伏伊伏丁那自治省）、斯蒂佩·舒瓦尔（克罗地亚共和国）、里扎·萨蓬季尤（科索沃自治省）、奈纳德·布钦（黑山共和国），他们都是通过自下而上方式确定多名候选人后由选民直接选举或经共和国、自治省议会代表无记名投票选举产生的。马其顿共和国和波黑共和国的候选人未能获得本共和国议会代表多数票通过，因此暂时由这两个共和国主席团主席参加联邦主席团工作，直到新的成员选出为止。
    新主席团任期５年，他们在庄严宣誓后正式就职。
    本届主席团的６名新成员平均年龄５５岁，比上届主席团年轻１１岁多。最年轻的亚·德尔诺夫舍克仅３９岁。
    按既定的轮换次序，本届主席团从其成员中选出德尔诺夫舍克为主席团主席。
    此间舆论认为新主席团是在国家处于比５年前更为困难的状况下开始工作的，他们面临的任务绝不轻松。其成员的年轻化和专业化给人们带来了某种希望。
