Title: Diverse Opinions

In the past, when the Soviet Union convened the Supreme Soviet, it would take only three to five minutes to pass the agenda and working procedures. Today, it took two hours, with 10 votes, and 25 speakers, including nuclear physicist Sakharov and Moscow People's Front member Stankevich, who each spoke twice. Some called for a moment of silence for those who died in the Tbilisi tragedy on April 9, some volunteered to be the chairman of the Supreme Soviet, and some believed that Gorbachev presiding over the first day of the meeting was illegal. Gorbachev suggested a vote "to avoid the accusation of usurping power." There were also those who opposed selecting more than 500 people from over 2,000 representatives to form the Supreme Soviet, believing this created a two-tier system among the representatives.

The opening ceremony of the first People's Congress reflected, to some extent, the current diversity of opinions in Soviet society.

    意见多元
    过去苏联开最高苏维埃代表大会，只用三五分钟即可通过议程和工作规程。今天用了两小时，表决１０次才通过这两个程序，发言达２５人次，其中核物理学家萨哈罗夫和莫斯科人民阵线成员斯坦克维奇两次登台。有人要大会为４月９日第比利斯惨案中殉难的人默哀，有人毛遂自荐当最高苏维埃主席，有人认为戈尔巴乔夫主持第一天会议不合法，戈尔巴乔夫建议表决，“以免以为我篡权”。还有人反对在２０００多名人民代表中选出５００多人组成的最高苏维埃，认为这样把代表分成两等。
    首届人代会的开幕式从一个侧面反映了当前苏联社会的意见多元化。
