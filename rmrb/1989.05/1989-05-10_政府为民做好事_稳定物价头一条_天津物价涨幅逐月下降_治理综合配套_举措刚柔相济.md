Tianjin's Price Increases Decreasing Monthly
Comprehensive and Coordinated Measures: Actions are Firm and Flexible

Tianjin, May 10th - Reporter Xiao Di reports: Tianjin City has adopted a combination of firm and flexible strategies to manage prices. After two consecutive years of keeping the overall price increase rate lower than the national average, the city's retail price increase index for January to April this year has decreased month by month compared to the same period last year, placing Tianjin in the 34th position out of 35 large and medium-sized cities surveyed by the National Bureau of Statistics in the first quarter.

The Tianjin municipal government has prioritized stabilizing prices as the top task in its effort to do 20 good things for urban and rural residents. In maintaining relatively stable prices, the government has implemented both strict measures and flexible approaches. The key measures include:

- Implementing comprehensive and coordinated methods to stabilize the prices of "food." According to statistics, among the 45 main food items, compared to neighboring Beijing, 12 items are higher, 3 items are the same, and 30 items are lower, accounting for 64%. The municipal government has clearly stipulated that the prices of grain and oil for urban residents' rationed supplies will remain unchanged. The prices of rationed meat, eggs, and sugar will be stabilized at the level of last July.

- Concentrating price approval authority to a certain extent, and being extremely cautious about implementing price increases. Prices and service charges for items under municipal management will not be raised without the approval of the municipal government; for important varieties among liberalized consumer goods, a strict price increase reporting system will be implemented; for goods entering the city from other regions, prices will be reasonably set according to national and local regulations on regional differences, purchase-sale differences, and wholesale-retail differences.

- Striving to rectify prices in the circulation links. For important commodities that have been liberalized, corresponding measures will be taken to manage their prices, and necessary and appropriate guidance and management will be provided for the market-adjusted portion.

For commodities whose raw material prices have increased but for which it is not appropriate to raise prices, Tianjin City adopts a flexible approach where enterprises contribute a bit, commerce lets a bit, and the finance department supplements a bit. According to statistics, over the past year, more than 220,000 people have participated in price inspections, uncovering 277 major cases of violations involving more than 10,000 yuan each, and implementing economic sanctions totaling 17.625 million yuan.

　　政府为民做好事　稳定物价头一条     
    天津物价涨幅逐月下降    
    治理综合配套　举措刚柔相济
    本报天津５月１０日电  记者肖荻报道：天津市采取刚柔相济的对策驾驭物价，继连续两年物价总上涨率低于全国平均上升幅度后，今年１至４月零售物价上升指数比去年同期逐月下降，居国家统计局一季度统计的３５个大中城市中的第３４位。
    天津市政府把稳定物价列为为城乡人民办２０件好事的头等大事，在保持物价相对稳定方面，有硬措施，也有软措施。主要是：
    ——采取综合配套办法，把“吃”的价格稳住。据统计，在４５种主要食品价格中，与邻近的北京相比，除１２种超出、３种持平外，有３０种低于北京，占６４％。市政府明确规定：城镇居民定量供应的粮、油销售价一律不动。定量供应的肉、蛋、糖一律稳定在去年７月水平上。
    ——适当集中提价审批权，对涨价措施出台慎之又慎。市管商品价格和服务收费，未经市政府批准，一律不得提价；对已放开的消费品中重要品种，严格提价申报制度；对外埠进市商品按照国家和本市规定的地区差率、进销差率、批零差率合理制定价格。
    ——大力整顿流通环节价格。对放开的较重要商品的价格采取配套措施进行管理，对市场调节部分也进行必要的适度指导和管理。
    对原材料价格上涨又不宜提价的商品，天津市采取企业挖一点、商业让一点、财政补一点的弹性办法。据统计，过去一年来共发动２２万多人参与物价检查，查出万元以上重大违纪案件２７７件，实施经济制裁１７６２．５万元。
