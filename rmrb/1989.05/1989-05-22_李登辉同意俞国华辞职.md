Taipei, May 22 (Xinhua) -- Lee Teng-hui has formally approved the resignation of "Premier" Yu Kuo-hua. The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee will approve the nomination of Lee Huan to succeed Yu as "Premier" on May 24. Lee Teng-hui will then seek approval from the "Legislative Yuan" by the end of this month. The new and old "Premiers" are scheduled to exchange duties on June 1.

According to reports, Lee Teng-hui met with Yu Kuo-hua on the morning of May 20, and the two had a lengthy discussion. Lee Teng-hui once again expressed his hope that Yu Kuo-hua would not resign. However, since Yu Kuo-hua was firm in his decision to resign, Lee Teng-hui "reluctantly agreed."

The Kuomintang will convene its 13th Central Committee Plenary Session starting June 3, during which the "Premier" will present a report on administrative work as a party member. At that time, this report will be presented by the new "Premier."
