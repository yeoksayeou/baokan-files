Safety in Transportation is also Efficiency

The safety of railway transportation is achieved in a very complex environment, influenced by various factors such as weather, terrain, personnel, and the overall environment. Therefore, to ensure safe and smooth transportation, it is not only necessary for various departments within the railway system to coordinate their actions but also for relevant units along the railway line to work closely together. Our railway bureau has successfully implemented the joint construction of a safe and reliable line on the Shijiazhuang to Dezhou line, resulting in significant improvements in transportation production and public security along the line.

The Shijiazhuang to Dezhou line is 176 kilometers long, serving as a crucial route connecting North China to East China and a vital channel for transporting coal from Shanxi. Starting in 1986, we first organized ten relevant units along this railway line, including the Hengshui Engineering Section, Hengshui Traffic Section, and Shijiazhuang Locomotive Section, to form a joint body aimed at eliminating safety hazards within the railway system. Simultaneously, we established contact with four cities, eight counties, and over 300 villages along the line, as well as factories, mines, and schools within a 5-kilometer radius, to jointly build a safe and reliable railway line with local authorities.

　　安全运输也是效益
    石家庄铁路分局局长  曹钟雄
    铁路的安全运输是在一个非常复杂的环境中完成的，它受到天、地、人、环境各方面的影响，所以要想运输安全畅通，不仅要路内各部门的协调动作，还应该有铁路沿线各有关单位的密切配合。我们铁路分局曾经在石（家庄）德（州）线通过路内、路外共建安全放心线，使这条线路的运输生产和沿线治安秩序等方面都发生了显著变化。
    石德线全长１７６公里，是华北通向华东的要道，也是晋煤外运的重要通道。从１９８６年开始，我们首先把这条铁路线上的衡水工务段、衡水车务段、石家庄机务段等十家有关单位组成联合体，从铁路内部消除安全生产的隐患。同时，把与石德线有关的四市八县３００多个村庄，以及沿线５里内的厂矿、学校取得联系，实行铁路和地方共建安全放心线。
