The sport of fencing was introduced to Japan from France during the Meiji period. Currently, nearly 30,000 people in Japan enjoy and participate in fencing. Yamamoto Kōji, who once served as the head coach of Japan's Olympic fencing team, said: "The combative spirit is a latent instinct in humans, and fencing can bring out this instinct. Regardless of skill level, anyone can participate in a competition after practicing for a day or two and experience the unique thrill of fencing."

In the fencing classroom at the Tokyo Sports College, there are three evening classes per week. The attendees include both veteran athletes and beginners. Some people feel that their stomachs have grown larger recently and want to participate in a sport to lose weight, and they have chosen fencing. Many women lack confidence in their physical strength, but they find in practice that physical strength differences seem to play a minor role in fencing competitions.

　　日本击剑热
    击剑运动是明治时期由法国传入日本的。目前，日本喜欢和从事击剑运动的有近三万人。曾担任日本参加奥运会击剑比赛的国家队主教练山本耕司说：“好斗的精神是人的一种潜在本能，击剑可以将这种本能激发出来。不管水平高低，任何人只要练习一两天，就可以参加比赛，体验到击剑独特的惊险。”在东京体育专科学校开设的击剑教室里，每周有三日晚间上击剑课。听课的有老运动员，也有初学者。有人感到最近肚子大起来，想参加某项体育运动减减肥，也选中了击剑。很多女性对自己的体力没有自信心，但她们在实践中发现，击剑比赛中双方的体力差别似乎并不起多大作用。　　　　　　　　张敏先
