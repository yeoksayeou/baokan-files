According to a report by the Southern Daily, the Guangdong Provincial Government recently approved and forwarded the Provincial Labor Bureau's "Opinions on Rectifying the Order of the Labor Market and Strengthening Labor Management." The document requires various localities to rationally arrange and utilize the labor force to enhance social security and overall management.

In recent years, a considerable number of laborers from other provinces and rural areas within Guangdong have been engaged in temporary labor in the province's secondary and tertiary industries, playing an active role in promoting and developing the provincial economy. However, this has also added new pressures to Guangdong's grain supply, social security, family planning, and employment, among other areas. Therefore, the Provincial Labor Bureau, in its "Opinions," requires all levels of government and relevant departments to, in conjunction with the cleanup and reduction of fixed asset scales and the rectification of economic order, seriously withdraw laborers from other provinces and rural areas. The current focus of the withdrawal is on migrant workers from other provinces and construction workers. Employing units should do a good job of ideological work and assist in solving the repatriation travel expenses for the withdrawn workers. For those withdrawn to rural areas within the province, local governments should address their actual problems such as arable land and rations.

At the same time, various levels of government should strengthen labor management work. The recruitment of migrant workers should be based on the local grain production and market supply capacity, comprehensively considered, and arranged in a planned manner according to the principles of prioritizing urban areas over rural areas, local areas over external areas, and within the province over outside the province. Strict control should be exercised, and no unit should recruit migrant workers from other provinces who have flowed into Guangdong indiscriminately.

　　广东整顿劳务市场
    切实加强劳动管理
    本报讯  据南方日报报道：广东省政府近日批转了省劳动局《关于整顿劳务市场秩序，加强劳动管理的意见》，要求各地合理安排使用劳动力，以加强社会治安和各方面的综合治理。
    近年来，有相当数量的外省和省内农村劳动力在省第二三产业中从事临时性劳务，对促进和发展全省经济起了积极的作用。但是，它也给广东省粮食供应、社会治安、计划生育、劳动就业等方面增加了新的压力。为此，省劳动局在《意见》中要求各级政府、各部门结合清理、压缩固定资产规模和整顿经济秩序，认真清退来自外省和农村的劳动力。目前，清退的重点是外省民工及建筑民工。对清退的民工，用人单位应做好思想工作，协助解决遣返路费。清退回本省农村的民工，当地政府要为其解决好耕地、口粮等实际问题。
    与此同时，各级政府还要加强劳动管理工作，招用民工应根据当地粮食生产、市场供应等方面的承受能力，综合考虑，按照先城镇后农村，先本地后外地，先省内后省外的原则，严格控制，统筹安排。任何单位都不得就地招收盲目流入广东的外省劳动力。
