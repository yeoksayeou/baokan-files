Title: A Different Kind of Taste

A recent newspaper published a photo reporting that China's first dwarf bar opened in Fuzhou. Six dwarfs were active there, making the bar, which has over 120 seats, full every night.

Dwarfs are people with short stature due to various reasons. When passersby see dwarfs, they often look at them with sympathy. Unexpectedly, a bar owner in Fuzhou came up with a novel idea, gathering a few unfortunate individuals to act as waiters. The owner did not hire dwarfs because they are more agile than ordinary people, nor because their appearance is pleasing to the eye, but rather treated them as "exhibits" to attract customers and fill his own pockets. I believe this method of making money is not commendable.

I support appropriately arranging for dwarfs to do some work within their capabilities, with the goal of enabling them to be self-reliant, regain their confidence, and become useful members of society. If they are treated as objects of ridicule, it is not a blessing but an insult to them.

Dressed in fashionable attire, male and female customers enjoy the wine served by the dwarfs. What must be going through their minds? If these unfortunate and pitiful dwarfs were their own siblings, could they still laugh and drink heartily, gaining satisfaction from their perverse psychology? Those who humiliate others will ultimately humiliate themselves. Using physically deformed individuals as objects of amusement and ridicule is not only a desecration of social civilization but also reflects the low moral character of those who enjoy the spectacle. This phenomenon fully exposes the current problems in certain service industries. If these issues are not addressed, "service" will inevitably hit a dead end.

Whether as a customer or an owner, one must consider the social impact and uphold the principles of being a good person!

　　别有一番滋味
    劳福紫
    某报最近刊登一幅新闻照片，报道我国第一家侏儒酒吧在福州开业。６名侏儒活跃其间，使得１２０多个座位的酒吧夜夜客满。
    侏儒是不同原因形成的身材矮小的人。路人见侏儒，多是投以同情的目光。没想到福州一家酒吧老板却别出新裁，搜罗几个不幸者充当招待。老板并非因为侏儒较常人手脚灵活，也不是因其形象令人赏心悦目，而是把他们当作“展品”，用以招徕顾客，充实自己的钱袋。这种“生财”术我以为是不可取的。
    我赞成适当安排侏儒做一些力所能及的事，出发点是使他们自食其力，唤起自信心，做一个对社会有益的人。如果把他们当作供人取笑的活物，不是“造福”于他们，而是侮辱他们。
    穿着入时的男男女女顾客，品尝侏儒捧上的美酒时，心里是什么滋味呢？如果这些不幸、可怜的侏儒是自己的弟妹，自己能够谈笑自若、开怀畅饮、获得变态心理的满足么？辱人者终自辱。以生理畸形者作为逗乐、取笑的对象，不仅是对社会文明的亵渎，也反映了欣赏者自身人格的低下。这种现象充分反映了目前某些服务行业的弊病。不除此弊，“服务”势必走向死胡同。
    做顾客也好，当老板也好，都要顾及社会效果，讲点做人之道！
