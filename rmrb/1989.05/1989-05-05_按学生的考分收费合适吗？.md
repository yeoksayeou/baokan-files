During the Spring Festival, I visited a friend at the first high school in Danyang County, Henan Province. It happened to be the time when students were returning for winter vacation review sessions. As soon as I entered the school gate, I heard an announcement over the loudspeaker: "Returning students, please hurry to pay your tuition fees and register. Those who have not completed the payment and registration procedures will not be allowed to attend classes."

The tuition fees for 286 reviewing students varied from person to person, with the lowest being 82 yuan and the highest being 490 yuan. Several students told me: "The tuition fees for reviewing students are calculated based on their exam scores. Those who score 530 or above pay 20 yuan, and for every point below that, an additional 2.50 yuan is charged." "Last semester, the highest amount paid was 560 yuan. Including meals and pocket money, some students spend over 1,000 yuan a year. How can they afford to study like this!"

　　按学生的考分收费合适吗？
    春节期间，我到我省舞阳县第一高级中学访友，恰逢寒假复习生到校。一进校门我就听高音喇叭喊道：“返校的同学请抓紧时间按公布的学费交款注册，未办理交款注册手续者不得上课。”
    ２８６名复习生的学费因人而异，少的８２元，多的４９０元。几个同学告诉我：“复习生的学费是按考分计算的，期末考试成绩满５３０分的交２０元，每低1分多交2．50元”。“上学期最多的交560元，加上吃饭、零花，有的学生１年要花费１０００多元，这学哪上得起呀！”
