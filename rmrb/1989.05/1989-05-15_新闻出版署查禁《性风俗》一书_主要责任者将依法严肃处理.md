The State Administration of Press and Publication has decided to immediately stop the sale, recall, and destroy the book "Sexual Customs," and to deal with the book's editors and publishers according to the law.

The book "Sexual Customs," recently published by Shanghai Culture Publishing House, has been strongly condemned by Muslim groups in some parts of China due to its content that defames Islam.

A responsible person from the State Administration of Press and Publication recently pointed out that "Sexual Customs" is a bad book. It rudely insults Islam and seriously hurts the religious feelings of Muslims, violating relevant laws.

This person said that to seriously handle this matter, the press and publication management departments have decided to immediately stop the sale of "Sexual Customs," and to destroy its printed copies and printing plates. It is known that 95,240 copies that had not yet been shipped were destroyed on May 9, and those that have already been distributed are being recalled and destroyed. The soft copy version of the book has been destroyed under the supervision of the Shanxi Provincial Islamic Association Preparatory Committee, the Shanxi Provincial Public Security Bureau, and other units.

The State Administration of Press and Publication has also decided to order Shanghai Culture Publishing House to suspend operations for rectification, to impose economic penalties on the units that published and distributed the book; to order the main responsible persons of the book to stop working for self-reflection, and to have relevant departments deal with them seriously according to the law and relevant regulations.

This person said that the State Administration of Press and Publication has established a special task force led by Director Du Daozheng to handle all matters related to this book.

According to news from Shanghai, Shanghai Culture Publishing House has already suspended operations for rectification. On May 8, the Shanghai Municipal Press and Publication Bureau sent a representative to Beijing to apologize to the China Islamic Association for this matter.
