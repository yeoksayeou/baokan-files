In the majestic Qianling Mausoleum, there still stands a stele without inscriptions dedicated to Empress Wu Zetian. During her lifetime, Wu Zetian's power and influence were unparalleled. She once had a celestial pivot cast outside the Duomen Gate to record her achievements, but why, after her death, did she only erect a stele without any inscriptions? This has become a mystery for the ages. Thus, various interpretations have emerged, including the views that her deeds were either immensely virtuous or extremely wicked, that she had self-awareness, or that it was difficult to find an appropriate title for her.

On March 20, the *Lanzhou Evening News* published an article by Wei Mingkong, suggesting that the "stele without inscriptions" is a term of praise for those who are lofty and pure, which was a fashion in the Tang Dynasty. According to the *Northern Dreams Miscellany*, Tang Dynasty scholars and officials admired purity and integrity. For example, Zhao Chong, who was known for his upright character and did not write many articles, was called the "stele without inscriptions." As the Minister of Rites, Zhao Chong gained the respect of contemporary scholars for his purity and integrity. The famous Tang Dynasty poet and literary critic, Siku Ti, emphasized in his *Poetry Criticism* that "not a single word is written, yet all the elegance is captured," which became the highest pursuit for literary works in the Tang Dynasty and beyond.

In fact, this was not just a fashion of the Tang Dynasty. As early as the Spring and Autumn period, it was considered a virtue. Confucius's principle of "transmitting but not creating" was highly praised by scholars throughout history, and some even regarded it as the perfect embodiment of a scholar's personal cultivation.

From this, it can be seen that in the Tang Dynasty, people admired purity and integrity, and the title of "stele without inscriptions" was highly regarded by the world. Therefore, Wu Zetian used this to describe herself. This is the solution to the mystery of Wu Zetian's stele without inscriptions.

### 武则天“无字碑”之谜

　　武则天“无字碑”之谜
    在气势磅礴的乾陵，至今还立着一块武则天的“无字碑”。武则天在世时凶焰绝人，她曾在端门外铸造天枢，以记述自己的功业，而她死后为什么只树碑而不立传呢？这成了千古之谜。于是解谜者众说纷纭，出现了功德无量说、罪大恶极说、自知之明说、难以称呼说等等。
    《兰州晚报》３月２０日刊登魏明孔文章认为，“无字碑”是对清高者的美誉，这是唐代的一种风尚。据《北梦琐言》称，唐代士大夫崇尚清介，如赵崇“标质堂堂，不为文章，号曰‘无字碑’”。身为礼部尚书的赵崇，因“无字碑”之称成为当时士人推崇的清高者。唐代著名诗人、诗评家司空图在《诗品》中强调“不著一字，尽得风流”，成了唐代及其以后文学作品所追求的最高境界。
    实际上，这不仅仅是唐代人的风尚，远在春秋时期，这就被看作是一种美德。孔子的“述而不作”，受到历代士人的高度评价，甚至有人将此看成知识分子人格修养的完美象征。
    由上可知，在唐代人们崇尚清介，世人重“无字碑”之号，故武则天借此自喻。这就是武则天立“无字碑”的谜底所在。
