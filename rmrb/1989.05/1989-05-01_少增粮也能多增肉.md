For a considerable period, China's per capita grain consumption will not see significant increases, but the consumption of meat will rapidly rise. Based on the past four years of grain production stagnation and continuous growth in livestock farming, Zhang Gensheng proposes that it is possible to achieve more meat production with less grain.

Over the next few decades, even if China's total grain production reaches 500 billion kilograms by the end of the century, the per capita grain consumption will still be around 390 kilograms, the same as in 1984. While this amount is sufficient for direct consumption, the issue is that by then, national income levels will have increased significantly, leading to a substantial rise in food demand and a shift in consumption patterns, particularly an increase in the consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products. In 1988, the national per capita consumption of various meats and aquatic products was 30 kilograms, excluding exports and other uses, the actual consumption was about 20 kilograms. It is estimated that by the year 2000, the national per capita consumption of various meats and aquatic products will roughly double to about 40 kilograms (this is a conservative estimate). Including exports and other uses, the per capita consumption will be around 60 kilograms.

With per capita grain consumption remaining at around 400 kilograms, but meat consumption doubling, can this be achieved? If the old methods are still used, where producing one kilogram of meat requires three to four kilograms of grain, then for every additional 20 kilograms of meat consumed per person, an additional 60 to 80 kilograms of grain will be needed. Even if some direct consumption is replaced, per capita grain consumption would still need to reach 450 kilograms or more. Although it is possible to import some grain, it will still be very challenging. Since 1985, China's grain production has stagnated for four consecutive years, while livestock farming has continued to grow. Compared to 1984, in 1988, China's per capita grain consumption decreased from 390 kilograms to over 360 kilograms (actual consumption has increased), but the total meat production increased by 37.4% (including a 42% increase in pork, beef, and mutton), and aquatic products increased by 68%. This fact fully proves that the aforementioned contradiction can be resolved. There are also some countries abroad with similar grain levels to ours, but they can consume more meat. Therefore, I believe that it is possible to achieve a significant increase in meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products under the condition of not significantly increasing grain consumption, and the key lies in innovating China's livestock farming production.

From the situation in various places, to achieve "less grain, more meat," the following points have been mainly focused on, and these areas need to be further developed in the future.

First, develop the feed industry and improve feed efficiency. Currently, the country has a feed production capacity of over 400 million tons, with nearly 300 million tons produced last year, which has played an important role in the development of the breeding industry. However, high-quality compound feed still only accounts for about 50% of the total production. If the quality is improved in the future, the breeding benefits will be even better. China currently uses about 100 billion kilograms of grain and cake directly to feed livestock. If some additives are added and processed into compound feed, the benefits will be greatly increased. The current problem is the severe shortage of additives such as methionine, which urgently needs to be addressed. In addition, China has a large amount of various straw, husks, fur, bones, and aquatic plants, which, after processing, ensiling, and ammoniation, can be fed to livestock to obtain a large amount of meat, eggs, and milk. The country also has 400 million mu of grasslands, and if the construction is strengthened, there is also great potential.

Second, adjust the livestock structure. After four years of effort, the current proportion of pork in the total meat production in the country has decreased from 85% to 82%, while the production of grass-eating sheep, cattle, and rabbits has increased year by year, and the production of chickens, ducks, and geese, which consume less and grow faster, has increased even more. However, the current proportion of poultry meat in the country is still less than 10%, while in Guangdong it is nearly 25%, and in Taiwan it has reached 30%. In the future, the production of chickens, ducks, geese, cattle, sheep, and rabbits should be further promoted. Of course, pig farming should not be relaxed, especially the development of lean-type pigs should be actively promoted to improve quality, but in the total meat production, the proportion of pork should be gradually reduced to below 80% to save a large amount of feed grain (1 kilogram of pork requires 4 kilograms of grain to exchange, while 1 kilogram of chicken meat only requires 2 kilograms of grain to exchange, and the protein content of chicken meat is more than twice that of pork).

Actively develop aquatic product production, especially freshwater and marine aquaculture, which is a crucial measure with low grain input, high returns, and quick results. In the past four years, China's total aquatic product production has increased by nearly 70%, with artificial breeding increasing by 115%. Producing 1 kilogram of freshwater fish generally only requires 1 kilogram of feed. Currently, the country has 90 million mu of freshwater areas, with half of them either unused or with very low yields. If they are fully utilized and the yield per unit area is increased, there is great potential. Aquatic products are also high-quality, high-protein foods that are beneficial for improving people's nutritional levels.

Third, develop appropriate scale operations and implement scientific livestock, poultry, and fish farming. This will improve feed efficiency, commercial rate, and economic benefits. With the continuous expansion of market demand, relying on individual households to raise pigs and chickens is far from enough. Therefore, in urban suburbs and areas with convenient transportation, various forms of scale operations have gradually emerged. The suburbs of Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, and the cities and counties of Shandong's Zhu Cheng and Guangdong's Ba'an have gradually formed a series of production, supply, and sales operations. These trends are in line with the development laws of the commodity economy. As long as stable development is maintained, it will be beneficial to enrich and improve market supply.

In the next ten years, if various places can focus on these measures and work hard, it will be possible to achieve the goal of "less grain, more meat," and it will be possible to double the consumption of meat under the constraint of per capita grain consumption of around 400 kilograms.

　　少增粮也能多增肉
    在相当长一个时期内，我国人均粮食占有量不会有多大增加，但人们的肉食消费水平却要迅速提高。张根生根据我国近四年粮食生产徘徊，畜牧业却持续增长的实践，提出：少增粮也能多增肉
    张根生
    由于人口的增长，到本世纪末，我国粮食总产量即使登上５０００亿公斤的新台阶，人均粮食占有量也仍只有１９８４年的水平，３９０多公斤。当然，作为口粮是完全够吃了，问题是到那时，国民收入水平有了成倍的提高，食品消费需求将大为增加，消费结构也将发生较大变化，主要是肉蛋奶消费要有较多的增加。１９８８年，全国人均占有各种肉类和水产品３０公斤，除去出口和其他消耗外，人均消费约２０公斤。预计到２０００年，全国人均消费各种肉类和水产品将大体上比现在增加一倍，达到４０公斤（这还是保守的估计）。包括出口和其它消耗，人均占有约６０公斤。
    人均粮食仍是４００来公斤，肉食却要增长１倍，能实现吗？如果还用老办法，生产每公斤肉消耗三四公斤粮食，则每人多吃２０公斤肉，就要多消耗６０—８０公斤粮食。即便替代一部分直接消费，人均消费粮食也要达到４５０公斤以上。虽然可以进口一部分粮食，但无论如何是很困难的。１９８５年以来，我国粮食生产连续四年徘徊，而同期畜牧业却连年增长。与１９８４年相比，１９８８年我国的人均占有粮食由３９０公斤降为３６０多公斤，（实际消费量有所增长）但肉类总产量却增加了３７．４％（其中猪牛羊肉增长４２％），水产品增加了６８％。这一事实，充分证明了上述矛盾是可以解决的。在国外也有些国家，和我们差不多的粮食水平，而可以吃到较多的肉食。因此，我认为在粮食消费不大量增加的条件下，实现肉、鱼和蛋、奶的成倍增长是有可能的，出路就在于革新我国的畜牧业生产。
    从各地情况看，实现“少增粮多增肉”，主要是抓了以下几点，而今后发展也需在这几点上继续下功夫。
    一是发展饲料工业，提高饲料报酬率。现在全国已有４０００多万吨配、混饲料生产能力，去年生产近３０００万吨，这对饲养业的发展起了重要作用。但现在高质量的配合饲料还只占总产量的５０％左右，如果今后提高质量，饲养效益会更好。我国现在每年大约有１０００多亿公斤粮食、饼粕直接喂了牲畜，如能增加一些添加剂，加工成配合饲料，效益就会大增。现在的问题是蛋氨酸等添加剂严重不足，急需加快发展。此外，我国还有极为大量的各种秸秆、籽壳、毛骨和水生植物等，经过加工、青贮、氨化，喂养牲畜，可以换取大量肉、蛋、奶。全国还有４０亿亩草原，如能加强建设，也有极大的潜力。
    二是调整畜牧结构。经过四年努力，现在全国猪肉占肉类总量的比例，已由８５％降到８２％，而食草的羊、牛、兔连年发展，消耗低、生长快的鸡、鸭、鹅发展更快。但现在全国禽肉还占不到１０％，而广东已近２５％，台湾达到了３０％。今后应继续大力发展鸡、鸭、鹅、牛、羊、兔等的生产。当然，对养猪也不能放松，特别应积极发展瘦肉型猪，提高质量，但在肉类总量中应逐步使猪肉占的比例降到８０％以下，以节省大量饲料粮（１公斤猪肉要４公斤粮食换，１公斤鸡肉只要２公斤粮食换，而且蛋白质含量鸡肉比猪肉高一倍以上）。
    积极发展水产品生产，特别是淡、海水养殖业，这是投粮少、收益大、见效快的重要措施。近４年来，我国水产品总产量增长近７０％，其中人工养殖的增长了１１５％。产１公斤淡水鱼一般只要一公斤饲料，现在全国有淡水水面９０００万亩，仍有一半未被利用或产量很低，如加以充分利用和提高单产，则是大有可为的。水产品又是优质高蛋白食品，对提高人们的营养水平很有好处。
    三是发展适度规模经营，实行科学养畜、养禽、养鱼。既提高饲料报酬，又提高商品率和经济效益。随着市场需求的日益扩大，只靠一家一户养猪、养鸡已远远不够了。因此，在城市郊区和交通方便的地方便逐步发展起了各种形式的规模经营。北京、上海、济南等郊区和山东诸城、广东宝安等市县还逐步形成了产、供、销系列化经营。这些趋势是符合商品经济发展规律的，只要坚持稳步发展，是有利于丰富、改善市场供应的。
    在今后十年中，各地如能抓住这几项措施，扎扎实实地做下去，就可以实现少增粮多增肉，就可以在人均占有４００来公斤粮食的限制下，实现人均消费肉食翻一番。
