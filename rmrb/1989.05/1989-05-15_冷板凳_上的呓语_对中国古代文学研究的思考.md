The Delirium on the "Cold Bench"
— Reflections on the Study of Chinese Ancient Literature
Cui Haizheng

I do not intend to easily dismiss the achievements of the study of Chinese ancient literature in recent years, but if we examine the overall situation, any blind optimism seems extremely discordant. Insightful scholars have already issued warnings: the study of ancient literature has entered a "frozen period," urging people to be prepared to sit on the "cold bench" for a long time. This sad sigh is not without reason.

Reform, opening up, and the impact of the commodity economy have caused the entire cultural and academic system of the contemporary era to undergo continuous new splits and new combinations. As a part of contemporary culture, the study of ancient literature has always been in a state of extreme maladaptation and abnormal passivity in this new cultural environment. Currently, the gloomy clouds of a downturn are increasingly thick over the sky of the ancient literature research community.

Personnel. The older generation of researchers, either due to old age and declining health, or due to their inability to accept new challenges, have quietly "retired" in batches. They have mostly already achieved fame and success, and their current mindset can be reflected in the phrase, "It is up to the times to decide whether to use or discard, to advance or retreat; it is up to me to decide whether to act or retire; it is fine to sit idly by and watch from the sidelines." This can serve as a realistic portrayal of their current mindset. Young researchers have courage but generally lack sufficient knowledge and theoretical cultivation, making them seem immature. Except for a few lucky individuals who have emerged, most do not have the opportunity to take the lead. As for the middle-aged scholars who serve as the backbone, due to special historical reasons, their academic cultivation and research consciousness have obvious gaps with the generations above and below. Additionally, the practical burdens of both material and spiritual aspects make it difficult for them to advance lightly. Therefore, the research team is disorganized, and the centrifugal force is quite strong, which is more pronounced compared to other research fields. The most serious issue is that some have changed their field or have changed it in a disguised manner, while others are in a state of helpless confusion and inaction.

Ideas. The traditional mindset still tightly binds the researchers of ancient literature, and habitual thinking makes them reluctant to easily part with the bases they have trained for so long. In the eyes of some, annotations and textual research (which are not unnecessary) are the true scholarly pursuits that can be passed down through the ages, and sociological methods (which are still effective) are the Marxist critiques that are in line with national conditions. A few years ago, when certain ideas and methods entered the country and showed vitality in other research fields, some ancient literature researchers viewed them as heresies and kept them out of the door. Later, they criticized papers that showed a bit of new ideas as "patchwork" that forcefully applies Western theories to Chinese ancient literature. Even now, some people still believe that the study of ancient literature only needs to rebuild the lost experience materials, and even consider macro-level discussions as worthless generalizations. This stubbornness has caused the study of ancient literature to miss opportunities and become sluggish and directionless in the new era's academic tide.

Publication. Difficulty in publishing and difficulty in getting works published are also ghosts that haunt the study of ancient literature. There are very few specialized journals, and even the remaining "old brand" _Literary Heritage_ frequently suspends publication due to funding issues. The number of ancient literature research papers published in university journals and provincial social science association publications has decreased, and due to certain practical reasons (such as job evaluations), they generally do not accept external submissions. Publishers rarely accept ancient literature research monographs, and those that have been accepted are either delayed indefinitely or returned. Impoverished researchers cannot afford the expensive publication fees, making self-publishing almost impossible. This seems to be no fault of the publishing houses, as market information, reader feedback, and economic benefits ruthlessly exclude these works from the competitive ranks. This harsh reality, which does not require theoretical speculation, leaves ancient literature researchers at a loss.

Achievements. Perhaps related to the above issues, the ancient literature research monographs published in recent years are not satisfactory. Except for a few journals that have published some high-level academic papers, many articles published in newspapers and magazines lack new ideas, and there is a significant proportion of rehashed and fragmented articles. Rigid analysis and stiff reasoning, although already criticized, still appear under the banners of "new interpretations" and "new theories." It is no secret that those hastily compiled articles for job evaluations or "relationship" articles will not inspire readers. Smart publishing houses are reprinting past classics or reference works, and specialized works with a sense of the times are hard to find, even if one searches "thousands of times" in the bookstores. This situation has intensified the "crisis awareness" of ancient literature researchers.

Indeed, the above predicaments are not unique to the study of ancient literature. Even fields like contemporary and modern literature and literary theory, which were once very active, are said to show signs of decline. Indeed, the old ways are no longer suitable, and the new ways are either unknown or should be unknown. The target is unclear. After the frenzy of experimentation, people generally feel confused. Perhaps the current cultural environment and cultural mindset are the root of all problems, but this article cannot elaborate on this. As for the study of ancient literature discussed here, it has always been difficult to advance and is now seemingly even "colder." Some have proposed various suggestions, made various plans and predictions. I think people should be more practical, because between beautiful theories and complex realities, there is often a middle ground. Blindly entering this "blank" area often causes more trouble. With this in mind, I offer my humble opinions.

First, popular books on ancient literature have always been "hot items" on the cultural stage, and this fact has long provided a message: the "loss" in research lies in the contradiction between it and the actual needs of the recipients. Since stories about ancient writers and ancient literature are still popular among the general public (or television viewers), this indicates that ancient literature still has a strong cohesive force in society. The question is how to connect research with needs. I think changing the writing style can serve as an intermediate link. We might as well write academic papers that are more beautiful, interesting, and accessible, with a variety of styles, forming a "creative writing-style research" style. This is not only because writing research papers is also a form of creation and should bring joy to readers, but also because, in the new cultural environment, the renewal of ancient literature research consciousness and the improvement of research level require the participation of the entire society. To open up the path for the further development of ancient literature research.

Second, some weighty ancient literature research papers are inevitably accompanied by new ideas and new methods, and are the results of the author's comprehensive, three-dimensional, and cross-disciplinary research. Some are not even written by professional researchers. This fact also gives us an inspiration: for the current high-level research, the innovation of research consciousness is crucial. Undoubtedly, the research results of other humanities and even natural sciences should also be absorbed by the study of ancient literature. However, I think that the research results of some disciplines, such as linguistics, should be paid more attention. Because no matter how many definitions people give to "literature," the fact that literary works are written in language is indisputable. In this sense, it is the closest to literature. In the West, borrowing the research results of linguistics has led to the birth and influence of new academic schools and critical methods such as semantic criticism and structuralism, which have all performed brilliantly. In a sense, Chinese literature is actually Han language literature, and Han language and characters have a great uniqueness compared to the languages and characters of Western countries. If researchers can closely focus on the characteristics of Han language and characters in building the great edifice of Chinese ancient literature, perhaps a new path can be opened.

Third, researchers of ancient literature should seek points of contact with contemporary life, so that their research can harmonize with contemporary cultural consciousness. Although obtaining economic benefits has become the "hot spot" that people in today's society pursue, people's psychological needs are indeed multifaceted. People still need to find beauty, comfort, and consolation in ancient literature, and to find lessons from success and failure. Therefore, the study of ancient literature and the commodity society are not without bridges that can be built. There is no need to "shun profit," and the commodification of academic achievements will not make ancestors lose face or disgrace the teacher's door. Moreover, researchers of ancient literature should dare to discard pedantry, dare to speak out, and make full use of their unique research objects to enter contemporary society. They should let academic papers have the breath of real life, try to break down the psychological barriers between ancient and modern times, and between ancient and contemporary literature, so that people can rediscover and perfect themselves in the distant journey of the soul. Additionally, academic papers should strive to be concise, essence-filled, and information-rich.

### “冷板凳”上的呓语——对中国古代文学研究的思考

　　“冷板凳”上的呓语    
    ——对中国古代文学研究的思考
    崔海正
    我无意轻而易举地一笔勾销近年来中国古代文学研究的某些实绩，然而，如果从总体上审视其研究现状，任何盲目的乐观都显得极不和谐。有见识的学者已经发出警告：古代文学研究进入了“冰冻期”，告诫人们要有长期坐“冷板凳”的准备，这种悲伤的叹息不无缘由。
    改革、开放与商品经济的冲击使当代整个文化学术系统不断发生新的裂变与新的组合，作为当代文化组成部分的古代文学研究，在这一新的文化环境中始终处于极不适应和异常被动的地位。目前，不景气的阴云愈益浓重地弥漫在古代文学研究界的上空。
    队伍。老一代研究者或因年迈体衰力不从心，或因无法接受新的挑战分期分批地悄悄“退役”。他们大多已功成名就，“用舍由时，行藏在我，袖手何妨闲处看”，不妨作为其现实心态的写照。青年研究者勇气有余，但一般说来，因其知识储备及理论修养似嫌不足而显得幼稚。除个别幸运者崭露头角外，多数人并没有捷足先登的机遇。作为中流砥柱的中年学者，由于特殊的历史原因，其学术素养和研究意识与上下两代人都有明显的断层，加之物质的与精神的实际负担，使他们难以轻装上阵。因此，研究队伍序列不整，离心力又相当顽强，这一点较之其他研究领域更为突出。尤其严重的是，有人已经改行或者变相改行，有的人则在无可奈何的困惑中无所作为。
    观念。固有的传统仍然紧紧地捆绑着古代文学研究者，习惯性思路使他们不肯轻易告别训练已久的基地。在有些人看来，笺注、考据之类（并非不需要）才是足以传世的真正学问，社会学方法（依然行之有效）才是符合国情的马克思主义批评。几年前，当某些观念与方法越入国境并在其他研究领域表现出活力的时候，有些古代文学研究者则将其视为异端而拒之门外，此后又以种种理由责难稍露新意的论文是掇拾洋人唾余硬套中国古代文学的“拼盘”。直至现在，仍然有人认为古代文学研究只须重建已经失去的经验材料，甚至连宏观性探讨也看作不值一文的泛泛空论。这种偏执使古代文学研究坐失良机，在新时期的学术浪潮中萎靡不振，无所适从。
    出版。发表难、出版难也是困扰古代文学研究的一个幽灵。专门性刊物极少，就连《文学遗产》这个仅存的“老字号”也不断因经费问题“敬告作者”。大专院校学报和省社科联刊物发表的古代文学研究论文数量减少，而且，由于某种现实原因（如评职称）自我封闭，一般不发外来稿件。出版社很少接受古代文学研究论著，已经接受的或者无限期拖延，或者退稿。清贫的研究者交不起昂贵的出版费用，自费出版谈何容易。这似乎不能埋怨出版机构，市场信息、读者反馈信息、经济效益无情地把这些论著逐出竞争的行列。这个无须进行理论思辨的严峻现实，使古代文学研究者一筹莫展。
    成果。也许与上述种种有内在联系，近几年发表的古代文学研究论著不尽人意。除少数刊物发表了部分有较高学术水平的论文外，见诸于报刊的不少文章无甚新意，改头换面的照抄式与零敲碎打式文章占有不小的比例。僵硬的推敲与呆板的分析虽已成为众矢之的，但打着“新解”、“新论”旗号的某些论说却依然是“陈年老醋”。不用讳言，至于那些因评职称而胡乱杂凑的应付文字或“关系”文章，更不会让读者提起精神。聪明的出版机构正在重印已往的名著或资料性著作，具有时代气息的专门著述，即使“众里寻它千百度”也不易在柜窗里见到。这种状况加重了古代文学研究者的“忧患意识”。
    诚然，上述困境并非仅限于古代文学研究，即如曾经非常热闹的现当代文学及文艺理论等研究领域，据称也露出萧条的端倪。的确，旧的一套不适时了，新的是什么或应当是什么，目标究竟在哪里，经过狂热的实验之后，人们普遍感到迷惘。也许现时的文化环境及文化心态是一切症结之所在，对此，本文无法作过多的阐述。至于这里所议及的古代文学研究，它一直举步维艰、而现在似乎更“冷”。有人为此提出过种种建议，作过种种设想和预测。我以为，人们应当实际一些，因为美妙的理论和纷纭的现实之间往往有一片中间地带，盲目踏入这片“空白”，常常更令人烦恼。有感于此，略陈陋见。
    第一，古代文学通俗读物一直是文化广场上的“热门货”，这个事实早已给人们提供了一个信息：研究的“失落”在于它和接受者的实际需要存在着矛盾。既然有关古代作家及古代文学中的故事依然为广大读者（或影视观众）所喜闻乐见，这从一个侧面说明古代文学在社会人群中仍有很强的聚合力，问题是如何把研究与需要沟通起来。我以为，文风的转变可作为一个中间环节。我们不妨把学术文章写得美一点，有趣一点，通俗一点，品种样式繁杂一点，形成一种“文艺创作式研究”的文风。这不但因为写研究论文也是创作，应该给读者以愉悦，而且因为，在新时期的文化环境中，整个古代文学研究意识的更新与研究水平的提高需要全社会参与。为古代文学研究的进一步开华打开通路。
    第二，某些有份量的古代文学研究论文必然伴随着新的观念与新的方法，是作者进行综合的、立体的、交叉式研究的结晶，有的并不是专业研究者写出的。这个事实也给我们一个启发：对目前较高层次的研究，研究意识的革新是至关重要的。毫无疑问，其他人文科学甚至自然科学的某些研究成果也应该为古代文学研究所吸取，但是，我认为有的学科比如语言学的研究成果似更应引起关注。因为不管人们给“文学”下了多少种定义，但文学作品是用语言写成的这一点却无异议。在这个意义上。它最贴近文学。在西方，借鉴语言学的研究成果导致和影响了语义学派批评、结构主义等新的学术流派与批评方法的诞生，它们都曾经作过出色的表演。从某种意义上说，中国文学其实就是汉语言文学，而汉语言文字较之西方各国的语言文字有着绝大的独异性。研究者如能紧紧盯住汉语言文字构筑中国古代文学大厦的特色所在，或许能开启一条新的思路。
    第三，古代文学研究者应寻求与当代生活的接触点，使其研究能够与当代文化意识相契合。虽然获取经济效益成为现时社会人们追逐的“热点”，但人的心理需求毕竟是多方面的，人们仍然需要从古代文学中寻找美，寻找慰藉和寄托，寻找成功与失败的借鉴。因而，古代文学研究与商品社会并非没有可以架通的桥梁。不必“谈利色变”，学术成果商品化不会使祖宗丢脸、师门受辱。再者，古代文学研究者应勇于摒除迂腐气，敢于说话，尽可能利用自己的特殊研究对象涉足当代社会，于学术文章中闻到现实生活气息，设法打通人们心理上的古今界限，打通古代文学与现当代文学的界限，使人们能在心灵的远游中重新认识并完善自己。另外，学术文章要力争写得简约、精萃而信息量大。
