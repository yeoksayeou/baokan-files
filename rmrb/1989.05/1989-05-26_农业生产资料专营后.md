The state's policy of specializing in the distribution of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films has played a positive role in reducing the burden on farmers and promoting agricultural production. However, it has also given rise to several urgent problems that need to be addressed:

- Inconsistent policies. According to statistics, there are nearly 20 collective and individual businesses in our county that are currently or preparing to sell specialized materials, and their prices are all higher than those of the supply and marketing departments. For this reason, the county supply and marketing department has repeatedly inquired with the industrial and commercial and price departments, but due to the lack of relevant implementation guidelines from higher-level business departments, these departments are unable or unwilling to solve this problem.

- Ambiguous clauses in the specialization policy. For example, industrial production fertilizers are not clearly specified, leading some departments to use the excuse of factory raw materials to stockpile large amounts of fertilizer. A certain company in our county has already stockpiled over 30 tons of fertilizer.

- Inability to enforce specialized prices. Due to the large gaps in the allocation quotas for some specialized materials, relevant departments in our county must still purchase them themselves. For example, phosphate fertilizer, which our county needs 180,000 tons per year, has an allocation quota of only 10,000 tons, with the rest having to be purchased from various sources by our county. This way, the transportation and loading costs add up, making the price of phosphate fertilizer "high in, high out," but the price department does not allow it. Therefore, stabilizing prices does not guarantee supply, and ensuring supply does not stabilize prices.

### 农业生产资料专营后……

　　农业生产资料专营后……
    国家实行化肥、农药、农用薄膜专营政策，对于减轻农民负担，发展农业生产起到了良好的作用，但同时也产生了一些亟待解决的新问题：
    ——政策不配套。据统计，目前我县有近２０家集体和个体户正在或准备经销专营物资，且价格都高于供销部门的价格。为此，县供销部门多次向工商、物价部门询问，可是由于工商、物价部门没有上级业务部门的有关实施细则，无法或不愿解决这一问题。
    ——专营的个别条款含糊不清。如对于工业生产用化肥没有说明，造成个别部门以工厂作原料为借口，大量储备化肥。我县某公司现已储备化肥３０多吨。
    ——专营价格无法执行。由于部分专营物资品种分配指标缺口太大，我县有关部门还必须自己采购。如磷肥，我县年需要量１．８万吨，而供应指标只有０．１万吨，其余的全靠我县四处采购。这样，运输、装卸等费用一加，磷肥价格就得“高进高出”，而物价部门不允许。因此，稳定了物价保不了供应，保了供应稳定不了物价。
