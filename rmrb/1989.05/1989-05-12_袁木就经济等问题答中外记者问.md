Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, answered questions from domestic and foreign journalists on China's current economic situation and other issues this morning.

At a press conference held by the Chinese Journalists Association, Yuan Mu first briefed the journalists on the development of China's national economy in the first four months of this year.

On Foreign Trade Exports, Fixed Asset Investment, and Currency Issuance

In response to a journalist's question about the figures for fixed asset investment, foreign trade exports, and currency issuance during the implementation of the tightening policy, Yuan Mu said that according to China's customs statistics, the foreign trade export volume from January to March this year was 9.7 billion US dollars, an increase of 9.4% over the same period last year, with the growth rate dropping by fifteen to sixteen percentage points compared to the same period last year. Fixed asset investment, after being controlled and reduced, has decreased. The total investment in fixed assets for the whole people from January to April this year was 3.04 billion yuan, a decrease of 3.6% compared to the same period last year, but it has not yet met the planned requirements. In addition, the economic benefits are not ideal. The comparable product costs of state-owned industrial enterprises within the national budget have increased by 15% compared to the same period last year due to price factors and backward management work. On the other hand, the profit and tax realized for every 100 yuan of sales revenue has decreased by 11% compared to the same period last year.

Yuan Mu said that regarding the currency issuance situation, the total currency circulation in the country at the end of last year was 210 billion yuan, an increase of more than 60 billion yuan compared to the end of 1987. Since this year, although some new currency has been issued, it is currently in a net withdrawal situation, and the amount of currency withdrawn is more than that of the same period last year.

Yuan Mu said that from the overall economic development situation in the first four months of this year, China's industrial production has not experienced a general decline. However, in some places, some departments, and certain state-owned enterprises, there are phenomena of production decline, which have complex causes, including shortages of funds, rising prices of raw materials, and some enterprises' internal management work not keeping up.

In response to a question about the retail price index for this year, Zhang Zhongji, director of the Comprehensive Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics, interjected to say that the average price index for the first four months of this year increased by 27% compared to the same period last year, with the increase rate gradually decreasing month by month. According to statistics, out of 35 large and medium-sized cities nationwide, 18 cities saw a decrease in the price index in April compared to March.

Addressing Social Distribution Inequality

When a journalist mentioned the tax evasion incident involving singer Mao Aimin, Yuan Mu said that after the incident of Mao Aimin's "underground" performances and tax evasion was exposed, she voluntarily paid the taxes owed after the relevant departments did some work. We welcome this. We also hope that others with similar behavior will pay the taxes they owe.

He pointed out that this incident also reflects that our tax system is not yet perfect, and tax work has not kept up. Therefore, through deepening reforms, alleviating the social distribution inequality that is widely concerned about is a task we must urgently address. To alleviate this contradiction, first, we must resolutely crack down on illegal behaviors, shut down various illegal business activities in accordance with the law, and further rectify the circulation order and clean up and rectify companies; second, we must further improve the tax system and strengthen tax collection and management, especially the collection and management of personal income adjustment taxes. All those who meet the tax collection standards must pay taxes according to the regulations, and eliminate tax evasion. Third, in the long run, we need to further develop socialist commodity economy and provide equal competition opportunities for people, so as to fundamentally solve the problem of social distribution inequality.

Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization Without Launching a Campaign

A journalist asked: In your previous dialogue with students, you mentioned that the opposition to bourgeois liberalization was "not thorough." Does this mean that someone will be held responsible for this lack of thoroughness? Does this mean that preparations are being made for another campaign against bourgeois liberalization?

Yuan Mu replied: In my personal understanding, opposing bourgeois liberalization and adhering to the four cardinal principles are the same concept, or one can say they are the same meaning. In the important documents of our party and government, this has been explained many times. The core issue of bourgeois liberalization is: denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China and denying the socialist system. Bourgeois liberalization as a social trend, our struggle with it will long exist in our society.

He also said: In my previous dialogue, I did not say that the opposition to bourgeois liberalization was "not thorough," but only said that there was once a phenomenon of being "not resolute." "Not thorough" and "not resolute" are two different concepts. In my speech, there was not even a hint of wanting to launch a campaign against bourgeois liberalization. I personally believe that solving problems in the ideological realm can only be done through hard, patient work to strengthen and improve our ideological and political work, and cannot be solved by launching campaigns.

Believing that the majority of students will act from the perspective of maintaining overall stability

A journalist asked: It is said that students plan to hold a parade and demonstration during Soviet leader Gorbachev's visit to China and demand a dialogue with him. What is the government's response to this?

Yuan Mu replied: Regarding the recent student parades, demonstrations, and strikes, as the spokesman for the State Council, I have already expressed my views in dialogues with students and press conferences. The leaders of our party and government have also expressed their views on this issue through various occasions. I believe that the students will act more rationally and calmly, follow the order, adopt a restrained attitude, and solve the problem step by step through dialogue in a reasonable manner and within the democratic and legal framework. I also believe that the vast majority of students will act from the perspective of maintaining national political stability and social stability, and will maintain our country's international image.

　　袁木就经济等问题答中外记者问
    新华社北京５月１２日电  国务院发言人袁木今天上午就我国当前经济形势等问题回答了中外记者的提问。
    在中国记协举行的记者招待会上，袁木首先向记者们通报了我国今年１至４月国民经济的发展情况。
    关于外贸出口、基建投资和货币发行情况
    在回答记者提出的在实行紧缩政策过程中，基建投资、外贸出口、货币发行量等数字时，袁木说，根据我国海关的统计，今年１至３月的外贸出口额为９７亿美元，比去年同期增长９．４％，增长幅度比去年同期下降了十五六个百分点。固定资产投资，经过控制和压缩有所下降，今年１至４月份全民固定资产投资总金额是３０４亿元，比去年同期下降３．６％，但还没有实现计划的要求。此外，经济效益方面也不够理想，国家预算内国营工业企业的可比的产品成本，由于物价的因素，加上管理工作的落后，比去年同期上升１５％。另一方面，每１００元销售收入所实现的利税，比去年同期下降了１１％。
    袁木说，关于货币发行情况，去年末全国货币流通量为２１００亿元，比１９８７年末多６００多亿。今年以来，虽然又新投放了一些货币，但目前还是处于净回笼的状况，并且回笼货币多于去年同期。
    袁木说，从今年１至４月份的整个经济发展情况来说，我们国家的工业生产没有在全局上出现滑坡现象。但是，在一些地方、一些部门、某些国营企业生产滑坡的现象是存在的，这里有资金短缺的原因，有原材料涨价的因素，也有某些企业内部经营管理工作跟不上的原因，情况是比较复杂的。
    在回答今年物价零售指数是多少时，国家统计局国民经济综合统计司司长章钟基插话说，今年１至４月的平均物价指数比去年同期上涨２７％，上涨幅度逐月有所下降。据统计，在全国３５个大中城市中，有１８个城市的物价指数４月比３月是下降的。
    解决社会分配不公靠三条
    当记者提到歌星毛阿敏偷、漏税一事时，袁木说，毛阿敏女士“走穴”演出偷漏税一事披露后，经有关部门做工作，她已主动补交了税款。对此我们表示欢迎。我们也希望其他有这方面行为的人补交应交的税款。
    他指出，这件事也反映出我们的税制还不健全，税务工作还没有跟上。因此，通过深化改革，缓解社会上普遍关注的社会分配不公的问题，是我们抓紧要做的一项工作。为了缓解这一矛盾，第一，首先必须坚决打击那些违法行为，依法取缔各种违法经营活动，坚决地进一步整顿流通秩序，清理整顿公司；第二，要进一步健全税制，加强税收的征管工作，特别是个人收入调节税的征管工作。一切达到收税标准的都要照章纳税，杜绝偷漏税现象。第三，从长远来看，需要进一步发展社会主义商品经济，为人们提供平等的竞争机会，这样才能从根本上解决社会分配不公的问题。
    反对资产阶级自由化不要搞运动
    有记者问：您上次在同学生对话时曾说，反对资产阶级自由化“不彻底”，这是否意味着谁将对这种不彻底承担责任？是否意味着准备再开展一次反对资产阶级自由化的运动？
    袁木回答：据我个人理解，反对资产阶级自由化和坚持四项基本原则是同一个概念，也可以说是同一个意思。在我们的党和政府的重要文件中曾多次对此作过解释，所谓资产阶级自由化，核心问题就是：否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。资产阶级自由化作为一种社会思潮，我们同它的矛盾、斗争，将在我国社会长期存在。
    他还说：我在上次的对话中并没有说过反对资产阶级自由化“不彻底”的意思，只是说过反对资产阶级自由化一度出现过“不坚决”的现象，“不彻底”和“不坚决”是两个概念。在我的谈话中，没有任何一点要搞反对资产阶级自由化运动的意思。我个人认为，解决这种思想领域的问题，只能靠艰苦、耐心地加强和改进我们的思想政治工作，而不能靠搞运动的办法来解决。
    相信广大同学会从维护稳定的大局出发
    有记者问：听说学生们要在苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫访华时游行示威，并要求同他对话，请问政府对此有何反映？
    袁木回答：关于最近学生的游行、示威、罢课，作为国务院发言人，我已经在和学生的对话以及记者招待会上谈了我的观点。我们党和政府的领导人也通过各种不同的场合对这一问题表明了看法。我相信，同学们会按照赵紫阳总书记提出的，更加理智，更加冷静，遵守秩序，采取克制的态度，通过对话的办法，依照合理的途径，在民主和法制的轨道上，使问题逐步得到解决。我还相信，绝大多数同学是会从维护国家政治稳定、社会稳定这个大局出发的，是会维护我们国家的国际形象的。
