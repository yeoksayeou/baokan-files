The renowned British scholar Joseph Needham, after conducting extensive research on the history of Chinese science and technology, concluded that East Asian civilization is a "bamboo civilization."

The history of cultivating and utilizing bamboo in China is long and rich. As early as the primitive era of humanity, the "Pangeng" song already sang, "Break the bamboo, continue the bamboo, fly the soil, chase the meat." This proves that more than seven thousand years ago, our ancestors used bamboo for writing, clothing, and entertainment. The "Book of Songs" also states: "Upper layer of bamboo mat, lower layer of bamboo mat, then it is comfortable to sleep." During the Song Dynasty, Su Shi said, "The food is bamboo shoots, the shelter is bamboo tiles, the carrier is a bamboo raft, the fuel is bamboo firewood, the clothing is bamboo skin, the writing is bamboo paper, the footwear is bamboo shoes. It can truly be said that one cannot do without this gentleman for a single day." This shows that bamboo has deeply penetrated into the lives of the Chinese people, playing a significant role in various aspects and profoundly influencing Chinese characters, science and technology, literature and art, and daily life. As early as five or six thousand years ago, during the Yangshao culture, symbols on pottery and later oracle bone inscriptions already included the pictographic character for "bamboo" and related characters. The earliest Chinese characters appeared on pottery symbols, followed by oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions. From the Warring States period to the Wei and Jin dynasties, over a span of about eight hundred years, characters were either carved or written on bamboo slips, thereby solidifying the Chinese square script characters with pictographic features and forming the unique Chinese calligraphy art. Bamboo holds a very important position in the development of Chinese science and technology. During the Shang and Zhou dynasties, China already used bamboo drills. In the water conservancy project of Dujiangyan in Sichuan, built over two thousand years ago, bamboo was extensively used. The world's oldest water pipes were made of bamboo, known as "jǐng" at that time. In Sichuan, where bamboo is abundant, by the Han Dynasty, bamboo cables were already used to drill wells. Due to the tensile strength of bamboo cables reaching four thousand kilograms per square inch, similar to steel cables, deep wells reaching four thousand eight hundred feet were drilled as early as the Han Dynasty. This technology of drilling with bamboo cables was not introduced to Europe until the nineteenth century. In 1859, Americans used this method to drill the first oil well in Pennsylvania. With the invention of gunpowder, during the Southern Song Dynasty, the first fire lance appeared, which used bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder. During the Yuan Dynasty, someone used four large bamboo tubes filled with gunpowder tied to the legs of a chair, utilizing the recoil force of the gunpowder to lift the person sitting on the chair into the air. This can be considered the earliest "manned rocket." During the Ming Dynasty, a two-stage rocket made of bamboo tubes, called "Fire Dragon Emerging from Water," already existed.

Bamboo is ubiquitous in the daily lives of the Chinese people, closely related to clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Due to its firm, tough, flexible, straight, pressure-resistant, tensile-resistant, and anti-corrosive properties, bamboo is an ideal building material. In the southern regions where bamboo is abundant, many ethnic minorities build their houses with bamboo. Even today, the Dai people still live in bamboo houses, and their furniture such as tables, chairs, beds, chests, baskets, and trays are mostly made of bamboo. Chinese people have been using bamboo chopsticks for at least three thousand years, and they remain the primary eating utensil for the vast majority of the Chinese people. Bamboo's uses in transportation are even more extensive, as it can be used to build ships, carriages, and bridges. Additionally, during the Jin Dynasty, Dai Kai wrote "Bamboo Records," using four-character rhyming verses to record the characteristics of over seventy types of bamboo. At that time, the invention of paper made from bamboo had already been made. Bamboo shoots are rich in nutrition, delicious, and were considered a delicacy even before the Tang Dynasty. Bamboo can also be used to make wine, as evidenced by the ancient poem by Xie Lingyun: "Three cups of bamboo leaf wine, one melody of the phoenix." Chinese music has a close relationship with bamboo. Anciently, music was referred to as "silk and bamboo," with the saying "silk is not as good as bamboo." Because bamboo dominated musical instruments, during the Tang Dynasty, performers of musical instruments were called "bamboo people." Bamboo is also an important subject in Chinese painting, calligraphy, and poetry. From the "Book of Songs" onwards, poems about bamboo have been outstanding in every dynasty. Painting bamboo became mature during the Tang Dynasty. In the Qing Dynasty, Zheng Banqiao achieved the pinnacle of bamboo painting.

"Before emerging from the soil, it already has nodes; when it reaches the clouds, it remains humble." Bamboo represents the character and integrity of the Chinese people. The Chinese have a special affection for bamboo, and Chinese culture is deeply imprinted with the mark of bamboo.

    漫谈“竹文化”
    姜斌
    著名英国学者李约瑟在深入研究中国科技史后认为，东亚文明乃是“竹子文明”。
    我国养竹、用竹的历史悠久，早在人类蒙昧时期，《弹歌》就曾高唱“断竹、续竹、飞土、逐肉”。证明七千多年前，我国先民们便将竹用之于书写、衣著和娱乐。《诗经·小雅·斯干》亦云：“上莞下簟，乃安斯寝。”宋代苏轼曾云：“食者竹笋，庇者竹瓦，载者竹筏，炊者竹薪，衣者竹皮，书者竹纸，履者竹鞋，真可谓不可一日无此君也。”可见，竹进入中华民族的生活中，在各方面发挥了巨大的作用，深刻地影响了中国的文字、科技、文艺、日常生活。早在五六千年前仰韶文化的陶器上的符号和其后的甲骨文中，已有象形的“竹”字及和竹有关的字。而中国的文字最早见于陶器上的象形符号，其后为甲骨文、金文。从战国到魏、晋，约八百年间皆在竹简上刻字或写字，从而使中国的以象形表意为特征的方块汉字固定下来，并形成了中国独特的书法艺术。竹在中国的科技发展中占有十分重要的地位。殷周时代，我国已使用竹钻。在两千多年前的四川都江堰水利工程中已大量使用竹子。世界上最古老的自来水管便是用竹制作的，当时称为“笕”。在盛产竹的四川，最晚在汉代已利用竹制成竹缆绳用于打井。由于竹缆的抗拉强度达每平方寸四千公斤，与钢缆的抗拉强度相似，故早在汉代便打出了深度达四千八百尺的盐井。这种用竹缆打井的技术，十九世纪才传入欧洲。一八五九年，美国人用这种方法在宾夕法尼亚钻出第一口石油井。随着火药的发明，在南宋已出现用竹管内装火药的突火枪，元代有人用四支大竹筒内装火药绑在椅子的四条腿上，利用火药喷射的反作用力，使坐在椅子上的人升空。这可以说是最早的“载人火箭”。明代已出现一种用竹筒制作的二级火箭，名叫
  “火龙出水”。
    竹在中国人的日常生活中更比比皆是，与衣食住行有密切的关系。由于竹具有坚、韧、柔、直、抗压、抗拉、抗腐等多方面的特性，是很理想的建筑材料。在南方产竹的地方，许多少数民族的住房皆用竹制。至今傣族人民还住这种竹楼，其家具如桌、椅、床、箱、笼、筐等皆多为竹制。中国人至少在三千年前已使用竹筷，至今仍是我国广大人民的主要餐具。竹在交通上的用途更大，可以用于造船、造车、造桥。此外，晋代戴凯之所撰《竹谱》，以四字韵文，记载了七十余种竹的性状，当时就发明了用竹造纸。竹笋有丰富营养，味鲜可口，早在唐以前就视为食中珍品。竹还可制酒，古代有竹酒，如庚信诗云：“三杯竹叶酒，一曲鹍鸡鸣。”中国的音乐与竹的关系也十分密切。古称音乐为“丝竹”，有“丝不如竹”之说。由于竹在乐器中占了统治地位，故唐代称乐器演奏者为“竹人”。竹更是中国绘画、书法和诗文的重要题材。从《诗经》开始，咏竹的诗文历代皆有佳作。文人画竹，唐代已趋成熟。清代的郑板桥，集古今画竹之大成。
    “未出土时便有节，及凌云处尚虚心。”竹，代表了中华民族的品格和情操。中国人对竹有特殊的感情，中国文化深深浸透了竹的印痕。
