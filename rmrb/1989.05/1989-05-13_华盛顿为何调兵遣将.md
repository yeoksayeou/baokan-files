**News Analysis**

After several days of deliberation and consultation, President Bush recently announced the United States' "seven steps" to address the "Panama crisis." The most notable action is the deployment of nearly 2,000 additional troops to the U.S. military base in Panama, with the statement that "further steps are not ruled out." Some have referred to this as limited "gunboat diplomacy."

With already 10,800 troops stationed in Panama, why is the United States continuing to deploy more forces? On the surface, the direct cause is the serious violence that occurred after the Panamanian elections, with the alleged harassment of American citizens by Noriega's military. Bush claimed that the U.S. is sending more troops to "protect the lives of Americans." In reality, Washington's motives go far beyond this.

In recent days, the White House has closely monitored the developments in Panama. During the May 7 Panamanian elections, Bush specifically sent an observer delegation. He not only convened several staff meetings, consulted with leaders from both parties in Congress, and received reports from observers, but also maintained telephone contact with many Latin American governments. Bush repeatedly criticized Noriega, the "dictator," for first attempting to "steal" the election from the opposition through various "deception and intimidation" tactics, and then declaring the election "invalid" and resorting to violence. Originally, the Bush administration had high hopes for this Panamanian election, expecting the opposition to win and thereby force Noriega to step down. To this end, the White House had approved a secret operation plan, providing the Panamanian opposition with $1 million in campaign funds. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned, and the Noriega regime declared the election "invalid." It was against this backdrop that President Bush consulted with leaders from both parties in Congress and decided to send more troops to Panama, further pressuring Noriega.

In fact, Bush's "seven steps" are a continuation of the Reagan administration's policy towards Panama. For some time, the United States has viewed Noriega as an "eye sore" that must be removed. The U.S. first accused Noriega of involvement in international drug trafficking and then took various measures, including economic sanctions and military threats, to force Noriega to step down. Subsequently, the U.S. adopted a "soft" approach, engaging in negotiations with the Noriega regime. However, the Reagan administration's "carrot and stick" policy did not work.

The new Bush administration also intends to force Noriega to step down, fundamentally to safeguard U.S. political and strategic interests in the Panama Canal Zone and the entire Latin American region. For the United States, Panama holds a particularly important strategic position, with the Southern Command located within the Canal Zone. According to the new "Panama Canal Treaty" reached in 1977, Panama will fully regain sovereignty over its canal by December 31, 1999, and U.S. troops will completely withdraw. It is said that the United States hopes to retain the Southern Command and military bases after the year 2000, but this has been opposed and rejected by the powerful figure Noriega. The media points out that this is the crux of why the United States wants Noriega to "step down."

Currently, the situation in Panama remains tense and complex. How Noriega will respond to U.S. actions and what the U.S. will do next are undoubtedly of concern to the international community.

From the reactions of most Latin American countries, they condemn the Noriega regime for declaring the election "invalid," but at the same time, they warn the United States not to intervene militarily.

　　华盛顿为何调兵遣将
    本报记者  张亮
    经过几天的反复思虑和磋商，布什总统日前宣布了美国对付“巴拿马危机”的“七项步骤”。其中最引人注目的行动是向美国驻扎在巴拿马的军事基地增兵近二千人，并声称“不排除进一步采取步骤。”此间有人称之为有限的“炮舰外交”。
    在巴拿马已有一万零八百名驻军的美国为何要继续调兵遣将？从表面上看，直接起因是巴拿马大选之后发生严重暴力，所谓美国公民“受到诺列加军队的骚扰”。布什声称，美国增派部队是为了“保护美国人的生命安全”。其实，华盛顿此举的动机远非如此。
    连日来，白宫昼夜密切注视着巴拿马局势的事态发展。巴拿马五月七日大选时，布什特意派遣一个观察员代表团。他不仅多次召集幕僚会议，与国会两党领导人磋商和听取观察员的汇报，而且还与许多拉美国家政府保持电话联系。布什还一再指责诺列加这位“独裁者”先是企图以种种“欺骗和恫吓”手段从反对派那里“偷窃”选举，而后又宣布选举“无效”并诉诸暴力。本来，布什政府对巴拿马这次大选寄一定希望，期望反对派获胜，从而达到让诺列加下台的目的。为此，白宫曾批准一项秘密行动计划，向巴拿马反对派提供了一千万美元的竞选费用。不料，事不如愿，诺列加政权宣布选举“无效”。正是在这种背景下，布什总统与国会两党领导人磋商，决定向巴拿马增兵，进一步向诺列加施加压力。
    其实，布什的“七项步骤”是里根政府对巴拿马政策的继续。一个时期以来，美国就把诺列加视为非拔掉不可的“眼中钉”。美国先是指控诺列加参与国际贩毒，而后又接连采取了诸如经济制裁和军事威胁等多种手段，以迫使诺列加下台。随后美国又采用“软”的一手，即与诺列加政权举行谈判。但是，里根政府的这种“软硬兼施”的两手政策均未奏效。
    布什新政府同样立意要逼迫诺列加下台，从根本上说是出于维护美国在巴拿马运河区乃至整个拉美地区的政治和战略利益。对美国来说，巴拿马具有十分重要的战略地位，南方司令部就设在运河区内。根据美巴一九七七年达成的新的“巴拿马运河条约”，到一九九九年十二月三十一日巴拿马将全部收回其运河主权，美国驻军也将全部撤离。据说，美国希望在二○○○年以后能够继续保留南方司令部及军事基地，但遭到实权人物诺列加的反对和拒绝。舆论指出，这正是美国要诺列加“必须下台”的症结所在。
    目前，巴拿马局势依然严峻、复杂。诺列加对美国的行动将作出何种反应，美国下一步将怎么走，无疑为国际社会所关切。
    从多数拉美国家的反应来看，它们虽指责诺列加政权宣布选举“无效”，但同时也告诫美国不要进行军事干涉。
