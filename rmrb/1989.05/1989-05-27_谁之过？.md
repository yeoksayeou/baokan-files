Jonathan Campbell died on his first birthday in a state of coma, his death was gruesome. Photos taken by the Chicago coroner showed that parts of Jonathan's ears had been torn from his skull, and his mangled body was covered in bruises and wounds. The autopsy revealed that the child had starved to death and was severely dehydrated. The perpetrator who abused Jonathan to death was his mother's live-in boyfriend, Haberny. For this, the court prosecuted and sentenced him to 65 years in prison.

Three years after Jonathan's death, a second trial regarding this case was about to begin. This time, the defendant was social worker Diana Henton. She had never scolded Jonathan nor laid a hand on him. Instead, when the poor child was on his deathbed, she cried for several hours. Initially, after the Child Protection Department received a report of Jonathan being abused, Diana was assigned as his guardian to supervise the family with a history of child abuse. Now, a jury in Chicago is accusing Diana of failing to protect Jonathan from being abused by his family.

As child abuse cases continue to surface, social workers in the United States are facing more and more accusations.

People believe that what should be on trial is not the child welfare workers, but the increasingly ineffective child protection system. Cohen from the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse said that the system is on the verge of collapse. According to Tom from the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services, each guardian should ideally handle about 25 cases, but now they have to deal with 35 to 50 cases. In urban slums, the workload per person can reach over 70 cases.

Moreover, social workers face heavy burdens and unspoken difficulties when dealing with child abuse cases. In 1987, in Chicago, two social workers were accused of "coercion." The reason was that a child under their supervision died from abuse. Therefore, most social workers say that their job is like walking a tightrope. On one hand, they must respect people's "privacy rights"; on the other hand, they have an inescapable legal responsibility for suspected child abuse cases. This situation has made many people unwilling to engage in this work. The Dallas Child Protection Agency alone had 45% of its social workers quit last year.

Lack of funding also makes the child protection system increasingly ineffective. From 1980 to 1987, child abuse cases increased by 65%, but the federal and state governments only increased the funding for child protection by 3%.

Diana's accusation has made many people feel indignant. Now she faces the prospect of imprisonment. People's hearts are filled with a big question mark: Whose fault is it?

　　谁之过？
    乔纳森·坎贝尔满周岁那天就夭折了。死前陷入昏迷，死状凄惨。芝加哥验尸官的照片显示，乔纳森的两只耳朵有一部分被撕离头盖骨，支离破碎的身躯由于多处瘀血，伤痕累累。尸体解剖结果表明，孩子生前挨饿，极度脱水。将乔纳森虐待致死的凶手是他母亲的同居男友哈伯尼。为此，法院起诉，判他入狱６５年。
    乔纳森离开人世３年后，针对此案的第二场审讯即将开始。这次的被告是社会福利工作者黛安娜·亨顿。她从没有责骂过乔纳森，也没有对他动过拳头。相反，在这个可怜的孩子奄奄一息之际，她伤心地哭了好几个小时。当初，在儿童保护部门接到乔纳森受虐待的举报后，黛安娜被指定为他的监护人，负责监督这个有虐待儿童行为的家庭。现在，芝加哥的一个陪审团对黛安娜起诉的罪状是未能保护好乔纳森，使他免遭家人虐待。
    随着虐待事件的频频发生，美国儿童监护人受到的指控越来越多。
    对此，人们认为，现在要起诉审判的不是儿童福利工作者，而应该是日益显得无能的儿童保护制度。全国防止虐待儿童委员会的科恩说，这个制度正面临崩溃。据伊利诺斯州儿童和家庭服务局的托姆说，每个监护人负责２５起案件较合适，现在却要承担３５至５０起之多。在城市贫民区，人均工作量则高达７０多起。
    此外，社会福利工作者在处理受虐待儿童的问题上，不但负担重，而且有着难言的苦衷。１９８７年，在芝加哥，两名社会福利工作者被指控犯下了“胁从罪”。原因是一名由他们负责监护的儿童死于虐待。因此，多数社会福利工作者说，他们的工作如走钢丝。一方面得注意别人的“隐私权”；另方面他们对有嫌疑的儿童虐待案又负有不可推诿的法律责任。这种情况使许多人不愿意从事这项工作。达拉斯儿童保护机构，仅去年一年，就有４５％的社会福利工作者辞职。
    经费拮据也使儿童保护制度日益显得无能。从１９８０年到１９８７年，虐待儿童案件上升了６５％，而联邦政府和州政府拨给保护儿童的费用只增加了３％。
    黛安娜的被控使许多人感到愤愤不平。现在她面临入狱之灾。对此，人们心中出现了一个大问号：这是谁的过错？
