Title: Why Did a Domestic Airmail Letter Take Thirteen Days?

On April 11, I received a letter from a French friend who was visiting China. She had sent it from Suzhou on March 29 via airmail. In the letter, she mentioned that she would be returning to her country on April 9 and hoped to meet me in Beijing between April 7 and 9. Due to the fact that this letter took 13 days to reach me, I missed the appointment and let down my friend. The letter was just one page long, with a 1.2 yuan stamp, and the postal mark from the Suzhou post office was dated March 29, 11:00 AM, but there was no postal mark from the Beijing post office.

This delayed letter put me in an awkward and difficult position. I would like to ask the postal service: why did this airmail letter take 13 days?

### 国内一封航空信　为何走了十三天

　　国内一封航空信　为何走了十三天
    ４月１１日，我收到一位来华访问的法国友人３月２９日从苏州给我寄来的一封航空信，信中说她４月９日回国，她希望４月７日至９日在北京能见到我。由于这封航空信走了１３天才递到我手，使我误了约会日期，失信于友人。这封信只有一页纸，贴了１．２元的邮票，信封上苏州邮局的邮戳是３月２９日１１时，却没有北京邮局的邮戳。
    这封迟到的信，使我处于尴尬难辩的地位。请问邮局，这封航空信为何走了１３天？
