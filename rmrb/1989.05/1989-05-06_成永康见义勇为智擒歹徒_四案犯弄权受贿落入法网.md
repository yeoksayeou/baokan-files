Beijing City Construction General Company worker Chen Yongkang actively provided clues, helping the Beitaipingzhuang Police Station solve a robbery case.

On the afternoon of February 24, a female cashier from a certain unit withdrew cash from the Bank of China's Beitaipingzhuang branch. When she was cycling near the Beijing City Construction General Company office, she was robbed by a young man. Upon hearing the commotion, Chen Yongkang immediately joined the crowd in pursuing the criminal, but unfortunately, they failed to catch him.

When Chen Yongkang returned, he noticed that the criminal's bicycle was still parked in the original spot. He promptly reported this clue to the relevant authorities. The police station quickly apprehended the criminal, who was attempting to flee, based on the bicycle's license plate number. (Yi Ming, Rong Hui)

In the period from August 1986 to January 1988, four officials from the Transportation Bureau of Nanchang County, Hubei Province—Director Zhu Dacai, Deputy Director Yang Zongrong, accountant Li Minghua, and custodian Ding Yunghao—abused their positions to embezzle funds allocated for road construction and accepted bribes totaling over 40,000 yuan from contractors involved in bridge construction on public roads. The illicit funds have been fully recovered, and the four criminals have been lawfully arrested. (Huang Guangyu)
