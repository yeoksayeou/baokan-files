U.S. Secretary of State Baker reported on his trip to the Soviet Union to NATO on the 12th at a press conference held at NATO headquarters. He pointed out that on the eve of the NATO summit, the Soviet Union announced that it would unilaterally withdraw 500 tactical nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe, with the sole purpose of influencing Western public opinion.

When discussing the differences with West Germany, Baker said that in his personal view, even if the NATO summit at the end of this month does not reach a consensus on the issue of short-range missiles, "it is not a big deal," but if we let things go and allow a certain policy to drag the alliance's security into danger, "that would be disastrous." He believes that "the overall security and unity of the alliance are crucial."

Baker held the press conference after briefing his NATO counterparts on the "detailed situation" of his talks with Soviet leaders and after having a separate meeting with West German Foreign Minister Genscher. It is reported that he tried to persuade Genscher to align with the U.S. position on short-range missiles but was unsuccessful. He said that Bush had completed his review of foreign policy and not only hoped but was eager to resume comprehensive talks with the Soviet Union.

The NATO Council of Ministers, which convened yesterday, issued a statement after hearing Baker's report on his Moscow trip. The statement emphasized that Gorbachev's new proposal is "a welcome, positive, but still unimportant step."

　　贝克向北约通报苏联之行    
    美希望与苏全面会谈
    本报布鲁塞尔５月１３日电  记者魏崴报道：美国国务卿贝克１２日在北约总部举行的记者招待会上指出，在北约首脑会议前夕，苏联宣布要单方面从东欧撤走５００枚战术核弹头，目的仅仅是为了影响西方的公众舆论。
    谈到与西德的分歧时，贝克说，就他个人看来，本月底的北约首脑会议即便在短导问题上达不成一致，“也不是什么了不起的事情”，但倘若我们放手不管，任凭某一政策将联盟的安全拖入危险境地，“这才是灾难性的”。他认为，“联盟的总体安全和团结一致，是至关重要的。”
    贝克是在向他的北约盟国同行介绍了他和苏联领导人会谈的“详细情况”，又单独和西德外交部长根舍会谈之后举行记者招待会的。据此间新闻界透露，他试图在短导上说服根舍应向美国的观点靠拢，但未获成功。他说，布什已结束了对外交政策的审议，不但希望而且急于恢复同苏联的全面会谈。
    昨日举行的北约外长理事会在听取了贝克莫斯科之行的介绍之后，发表了一项公报。公报强调，戈尔巴乔夫的新建议是“一个值得欢迎的，积极的，但依然是不重要的步骤”。
