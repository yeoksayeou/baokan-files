In recent years, the trend in global educational reform has shown that many countries have come to realize through practice that raising the salaries and benefits of primary and secondary school teachers is a crucial factor in stabilizing and strengthening the teaching workforce, thereby laying the foundation for the success of educational reform.

In recent years, many countries have recognized during the process of educational reform that the issue of teacher compensation is a key factor in the success or failure of educational reform. The instability of the teaching workforce, teachers leaving the profession, and the severe decline in educational quality are all related to the low compensation of teachers. Improving and raising teacher compensation has become one of the major tasks of global educational reform.

Currently, many countries share a common trend in improving the compensation of primary and secondary school teachers: they generally tend to implement a high-salary system for primary and secondary school teachers, making their salaries more attractive than those of other professions with similar qualifications. The goal is to make the teaching profession more competitive and attract more outstanding talents to join the teaching workforce.

Japan, as early as the 1970s, had intense debates among various factions regarding the issue of raising primary and secondary school teachers' salaries during its educational reform discussions. In 1974, the proposal "Law on Securing Educational Personnel" was finally passed by the Diet, thereby ensuring the continuous influx of outstanding talents into the primary and secondary school teaching workforce. Starting from January 1974, Japanese primary and secondary school teachers' salaries increased by an average of 9%, and in January 1975, they increased by another 7%. In 1976, they increased by 10% again. Through the implementation of the "Three-Year Salary Increase Plan for Teachers," Japanese primary and secondary school teachers' average salaries exceeded those of general civil servants by 16%. At the same time, the Japanese government also stipulated that primary and secondary school teachers' salaries would increase with their accumulated experience and length of service, thereby encouraging teachers to engage in this profession for the long term. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the requirements for primary and secondary school teachers are very high, and their compensation is correspondingly more attractive than that of other professions in society. The theoretical basis for determining teachers' salaries in the Federal Republic of Germany is that "teachers' salaries should not only guarantee a reasonable living standard for teachers and their families but also provide superior conditions for teachers to improve their own qualities through training and participation in cultural activities." The average monthly salary of workers in the Federal Republic of Germany is 2,500 Marks, while a primary school teacher earns 2,700 to 3,100 Marks per month, and a secondary school teacher earns 3,500 Marks per month.

It is worth mentioning that some countries with originally low primary and secondary school teachers' salaries have significantly increased their salaries. The United States is a country with relatively low primary and secondary school teachers' salaries. Before 1983, the starting salary for American primary and secondary school teachers was the lowest among those with the same level of education, being 30% lower than that of accountants. Due to the extremely low salaries of primary and secondary school teachers, a crisis arose among American teachers. Faced with this situation, the legislatures of various states in the United States have successively formulated proposals to raise the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers. The most notable is the "Teacher Salary Advancement Plan" passed by the Tennessee State Legislature, which divides primary and secondary school teachers into four levels based on their teaching quality, allowing them to be promoted to the next level every 3 to 5 years, with an annual salary increase of 1,000 to 3,000 dollars. The average starting salary for teachers has risen from 13,000 dollars before the reform to 20,000 dollars, higher than the salaries of local officials.

Before the 1980s, the salaries of Soviet primary and secondary school teachers were relatively low compared to those of other professions. In 1984, the Central Committee of the CPSU clearly stated in the "Basic Guidelines for the Reform of General and Vocational Schools" that "the government will allocate approximately 12 billion rubles from the state budget for educational undertakings, of which 3.6 billion rubles will be used to improve and raise the salaries of primary and secondary school teachers." Thus, starting from September 1, 1984, the salaries of Soviet primary and secondary school teachers increased by 25% to 30%, and the increased salaries of primary and secondary school teachers were higher than the salary levels of workers in all other industries nationwide.

Many countries have also taken various measures to improve the social status of primary and secondary school teachers, providing them with special treatment and care that other professions do not enjoy.

In recent years, the United States has established the "Excellent Teacher Award," with 20 states currently implementing an annual bonus system for outstanding teachers. Selected outstanding teachers can receive 3,000 to 5,000 dollars in bonuses, thereby encouraging talented teachers to continue working in education. American teachers also enjoy superior welfare benefits such as retirement pensions, life insurance, and medical care. Japanese primary and secondary school teachers also enjoy various allowances and long-term and short-term welfare benefits.

Some countries also particularly emphasize the political treatment of primary and secondary school teachers.

North Korea formally issues decrees to confer titles such as "People's Teacher," "Meritorious Teacher," and "Labor Hero" to those who have made outstanding achievements in teaching. The Soviet government also established various medals and awards, such as the "People's Education of the USSR" medal, the "Makarenko" medal, the "Krupskaya" award, and the All-Union State Prize, to be awarded to primary and secondary school teachers who have made significant achievements in education, thereby promoting the formation of a societal atmosphere of respecting teachers.

　　教改成功关键：改善教师待遇
    余逸群
    近年来，世界教育改革的发展趋势表明：许多国家在实践中深切认识到提高中小学教师工资和待遇，是保证稳定和加强中小学教师队伍的重大关键，从而为教改取得成功奠定基础。
    　　　　　　　
    近些年来，许多国家在教育改革过程中深刻认识到，师资待遇问题是教育改革成败的一个关键。师资队伍的不稳定、教师改从它业，致使教育质量严重下降，都与教师待遇过低有关。
  改善和提高教师待遇，业已成为世界性教育改革的重大任务之一。
    当今，许多国家在改善中小学教师待遇方面有个共同趋势，就是普遍趋向于对中小学教师实行高薪制，使中小学教师的工资优厚于其它行业的同等条件者，目的在于使教师职业更具竞争力，以吸引更多的优秀人才进入教师队伍。
    日本早在７０年代初进行的教育改革讨论中，曾就提高中小学教师工资问题在各派之间展开争论。１９７４年，提高中小学教师待遇的提案《确保教育人才法》终于由国会通过，从而保障了中小学师资队伍不断充实优秀人才。
    从１９７４年１月起，日本中小学教师工资平均增加９％，１９７５年１月又增加７％，１９７６年再增长１０％。这样，经过“教师三年增薪计划”的实施，日本中小学教师平均工资超出一般公务员的１６％。同时，日本政府还规定中小学教师的工资随着本身经验的积累和工作年限的累加而增加，这就鼓励教师长期从事这一职业。在联邦德国，对中小学教师的工作要求甚高，他们的待遇也较社会上其它行业的人员相应地优厚。联邦德国制定教师工资理论的依据是“教师工资除保证教师本人及家属的合理生活水平外，还要为教师通过培训和参加文化活动来提高自身素质提供优越的条件。”联邦德国工人平均每月工资为２５００马克，而一名小学教师每月工资为２７００至３１００马克，中学教师月薪是３５００马克。
    需要提及的是，一些原本中小学教师工资待遇较低的国家也在大幅度地提高中小学教师的工资。美国是中小学教师工资偏低的国家。１９８３年之前，美国中小学教师工资起点在同等学历职工中最低，如比会计低３０％。由于中小学教师工资过低，引起美国教师的危机。面对这种状况，美国各州的议会纷纷制定提高中小学教师工资的议案，最引人瞩目的是田纳西州议会通过的最有代表性的《教师晋薪计划议案》，把中小学教师分为四个等级，根据其教育质量，３至５年可晋升一级，年薪可增加１０００至３０００美元不等。教师平均起点工资已从教改前的１３０００美元上升到２万美元，高于地方官员的工资。
    ８０年代以前，苏联中小学教师工资同其它行业人员相比，差距虽不像美国那么显著，但也是较低的。１９８４年，苏共中央在《关于普通学校和职业学校改革的基本方针》中明确指出：“政府将从国家预算中拨出约１２０亿卢布用于教育事业，其中３６亿卢布用于改善和提高中小学教师的工资。”这样，从１９８４年９月１日起，苏联中小学教师工资提高幅度为２５％至３０％，增加后的中小学教师工资，高于全国各行业职工的工资水准。
  很多国家为了提高中小学教师的社会地位，给予教师职业以种种其
      它行业所不及的优待与特殊照顾。
    美国近年来设立了“优秀教师奖金”，目前已有２０个州实行了对优秀教师的年奖金制度，评选出来的优秀教师可荣获３０００至５０００美元的奖金，以此鼓励有才能的教师继续从事教育工作。美国的教师还享有退休金、人寿保险、医疗保健等优越的福利待遇。日本中小学教师也享有多种津贴和长期短期的福利待遇。
  一些国家还尤为重视中小学教师的政治待遇。
    朝鲜对从事教师工作成绩卓越者，国家正式颁布政令，授予“人民教师”、“功勋教师”和“劳动英雄”等称号。苏联政府也设置了各种奖章和奖金，像“苏联人民教育”奖章、“马卡连柯”奖章、“克鲁普斯卡娅”奖金和全苏国家奖金等，以授予教育工作效果显著的中小学教师，从而推动全社会形成尊师重教的风尚。
