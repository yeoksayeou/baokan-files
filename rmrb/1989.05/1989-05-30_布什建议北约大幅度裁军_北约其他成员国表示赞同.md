	Bush Proposes Significant NATO Troop Reductions
	Other NATO Members Express Agreement

	On May 29, U.S. President Bush, at the NATO summit, put forth his first major proposal since taking office, one that he claims will "change the military map of Europe." His allies applauded enthusiastically.

	The proposal consists of three main points:

	1. NATO is prepared to reduce the number of helicopters and fighter jets by 15% from current levels. The same reduction is proposed for similar Warsaw Pact military equipment.
	2. The United States will cut 20% of its troops stationed in Europe, amounting to the withdrawal of 60,000 soldiers. The Soviet Union should also reduce its troops in other Warsaw Pact countries, so that the number of troops in both Eastern and Western Europe does not exceed 275,000. This means the Soviet Union would need to reduce its troops by 325,000.
	3. Accelerate the negotiations on conventional forces in Vienna, aiming to reach an agreement within the next six months to a year. The agreement should be implemented in 1992-1993, rather than by 1997 as proposed by Gorbachev.

	According to news from here, the leaders of other NATO member countries unanimously agreed with Bush's proposal. Recently, West German Chancellor Kohl, who has been in a heated dispute with the U.S. over the short-range missile issue, described the proposal as "outstanding" and said it "laid the foundation for new successes for the NATO organization" and "once again significantly affirmed the leadership of the United States." However, France, and possibly Britain, have reservations about reducing fighter jets.

	NATO officials believe that Bush's "wise move" has three purposes. First, it reaffirms the leadership of the United States in NATO and restores its authority within the alliance. Second, it aims to ease deep-seated disagreements within the alliance over the modernization and negotiations of short-range missiles, putting an end to the short-range missile dispute for the time being. Third, it takes the initiative to change the passive situation in recent years, where the West has only been able to defend against Gorbachev's peace offensive in East-West arms reduction talks.

    布什建议北约大幅度裁军
    北约其他成员国表示赞同
    本报布鲁塞尔5月30日电  记者魏崴报道：29日，美国总统布什在北约首脑会议上，抛出自他执政以来第一个重大的、“将要改变欧洲军事地图”的“大胆建议”，他的盟友们为之拍手叫好。
    建议主要分为3点：1、北约准备把直升机和战斗机数量，从现有水平上减去15％，建议华约的同类军备也压缩到同等水平；2、美国削减20％的驻欧美军，即相当于撤走6万军队。苏联亦应减少在其它华约国家的驻军，使东欧和西欧的军队，都不超过275000人，就是说，苏联得裁去325000人才行；3、加快在维也纳举行的常规力量的会谈，使它在今后6个月或一年时间内，达成协议。协议应在1992—1993年付诸实施，而不是戈尔巴乔夫建议的要到1997年再说。
    据此间新闻透露，北约其它成员国领导人对布什的建议，一致表示赞同。近来在短导问题上与美国争吵不休的西德总理科尔，认为这一建议是“卓越非凡”，为北约组织取得新的成功“打下了基础”，“再一次显著地证实美国的领导地位”。但法国，可能还有英国，对裁减战斗机，有保留意见。
    北约人士认为，布什这一“英明之举”含有三个目的。首先，是再次肯定美国在北约中的领导地位，恢复它在同盟内的权威。其次，是意图缓和同盟内部在短导现代化及其谈判上的深刻分歧，使短导之争暂告一段落。第三，是主动出击，改变近些年来，在东西方裁军谈判中，西方对戈尔巴乔夫的和平攻势只有招架之力的被动局面。
