We guarantee that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, we will actively do the following five things:

First, we will organize Party members, cadres, and staff in state organs and affiliated units to study the speeches by Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun. We will fully understand the importance of stopping the turmoil, stabilizing the situation, and restoring normal social order. Currently, the most important thing is to unify our understanding of the situation. The key is for Party organizations to do their work. We will guide everyone to gradually align their thoughts with the spirit of Comrade Li Peng's speech, clearly oppose the turmoil, consider the bigger picture, and stabilize the situation.

Second, we require all Party members in the central state organs to adhere to the four cardinal principles, believe in the Party's leadership, not to believe in various rumors and gossip, and consciously resist and oppose all actions that deny the Party and the socialist system.

Third, we require all Party members in the central state organs to strictly follow the martial law issued by the State Council and the Beijing Municipal Government, actively support and assist the troops and public security personnel executing the martial law to maintain order in Beijing, not to participate in parades, and not to do anything that is not conducive to stabilizing the situation. We will set an example by following the law and order, and maintain social order with our actions.

Fourth, we require all Party members in the central state organs to be loyal to their duties, guard their posts, follow labor discipline, maintain normal work order in the organs, and actively work hard to do their jobs well, ensuring that all business work is not affected.

Fifth, we require all levels of Party organizations in the central state organs to fully play their role as strongholds, and all Party members to fully play their role as vanguards. In stabilizing the situation, stabilizing emotions, and restoring normal order, we will assist various levels of administrative leaders in doing ideological work, ensuring the implementation of the spirit of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

Central State Organs Work Committee

Some provincial and autonomous region Party Committees and governments have sent telegrams to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressing their firm support for the speeches by Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Leadership Meeting. They have also expressed their firm support for the central government's and the State Council's decisions to restore order in Beijing.

Jiangsu Province: The Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee has unanimously and firmly supported the important speech by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the important speech by Comrade Yang Shangkun, and the decisive and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to quickly stop the turmoil. On the morning of May 20, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting with the heads of provincial organs and colleges in Nanjing. Comrade Han Peixin, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee, required all levels of Party organizations to consciously align with the Party Central Committee in the current severe situation, clearly understand the nature of this struggle, clearly oppose the turmoil, maintain a stable and united political environment, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and construction. He required all Party members to strictly follow discipline and guard their posts. He called for taking decisive and effective measures to maintain normal production, work, study, and living order. He stressed that actions denying the Party's leadership, the socialist system, and attacking the Party and state leaders must be firmly opposed. Comrade Han Peixin required all departments and units to continue to focus on rectification and reform, improve work style, promote clean governance, eliminate corruption, and do a better job in all areas.

Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region: On the morning of May 20, the Ningxia Regional Party Committee held a meeting of the Standing Committee. The heads of the Regional People's Congress, Government, Political Consultative Conference, Discipline Inspection Commission, and relevant departments attended. All attendees unanimously supported Comrade Li Peng's speech and the series of effective measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil. They expressed their determination to firmly align with the Party Central Committee politically, maintain their beliefs, and contribute to maintaining and ensuring the country's stability and unity, reform and opening up, and the smooth progress of socialist modernization.

The Standing Committee meeting analyzed the situation in the region, noting that while the region was initially relatively stable, the turmoil spread quickly, especially after May 17, making the situation severe. The central government's decisive measures have provided a clear direction for stabilizing the situation in Ningxia, and everyone has gained more confidence.

Based on the discussion at the Standing Committee meeting, the Regional Party Committee and the People's Government issued a notice on seriously studying and implementing Comrade Li Peng's important speech. The key points are:

1. All levels of Party Committees, People's Governments, and departments and units should organize Party members, cadres, the masses, and students to seriously study and discuss Comrade Li Peng's important speech at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Leadership Meeting, unify their thoughts, and firmly respond to the Party Central Committee's call to clearly oppose the turmoil, maintain stability and unity in the region and the country, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization.

2. All levels of Party organizations should play a leading and stronghold role in stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation, leveraging our political advantages, uniting the masses, and conducting thorough ideological and political work. Educate all Party members to strictly follow Party discipline and firmly align with the Party Central Committee politically.

3. All levels of Party and government officials must strictly follow discipline and guard their posts. Workers in all industrial and commercial enterprises and public institutions must follow labor discipline and maintain normal production order. All sectors and the masses must do their jobs well at their posts, ensuring production.

4. All levels and types of schools must maintain normal teaching order, especially colleges and universities, which must strengthen ideological and political work, guide education, and quickly restore normal teaching order. Great importance should be attached to strengthening and improving school logistics work, and efforts should be made to run the cafeterias well, so that students can focus on their studies.

5. Conduct dialogues at multiple levels, through multiple channels, and in multiple forms. The Regional Party Committee, Government, and relevant departments should conduct dialogues with students and people from all walks of life based on preparation. For students' reasonable and correct opinions and demands, as long as they can be done and should be done, they should be actively addressed. If they cannot be done, explanations should be given to the students.

6. All levels of Party Committees and Governments should attach great importance to ethnic work, seriously implement the Party's ethnic and religious policies, respect the customs and habits of ethnic minorities, respect the national and religious feelings of ethnic minorities, and further enhance the unity of the Han and ethnic minorities.

7. All levels of political and legal departments and public security personnel and armed police should guard their posts, fulfill their duties, and strive to maintain social and traffic order, protecting normal production, life, and work order.

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: On the morning of May 20, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee held a meeting of the direct organs of the region. Comrade Wang Qun, on behalf of the Regional Party Committee Standing Committee and the People's Government, spoke.

Comrade Wang Qun said that the speeches by Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun, especially Comrade Li Peng's speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, reflect the central government's correct decisions, the wishes of all Party members and the people of the country, and are of decisive importance in stopping the current turmoil and maintaining a stable and united political environment. The Regional Party Committee Standing Committee, the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army in Inner Mongolia, and the armed police firmly support Comrade Li Peng's important speech and the central government's correct decisions and resolute measures.

The Regional Party Committee and the People's Government are determined to unite and lead all Party members in the region, all ethnic cadres and the masses, to clearly oppose the turmoil and stop the turmoil.

The Regional Party Committee and the People's Government require:

All Party members and cadres of all ethnic groups, workers, farmers and herdsmen, intellectuals, soldiers, and armed police in the region must seriously study the notice from the CPC Central Committee and Comrade Li Peng's important speech, through serious discussion, fully understand the nature and severity of the current turmoil, fully understand the importance and far-reaching significance of the central government's decisions. They must work together, maintain their confidence, and contribute to stopping the turmoil and maintaining stability at their posts. All levels of Party organizations must unite the masses of all ethnic groups, conduct thorough and detailed ideological and political work, and truly play a leading and stronghold role in stabilizing the overall situation. For any problems that have occurred or may occur, they must be handled democratically and legally.

In stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the overall situation, Party members must pass the test, strictly follow the Party Constitution, implement Party rules and regulations, fulfill their duties as Party members, and fully play their role as vanguards. All actions and words harmful to the Party's image and the people's interests, and all actions and words not conducive to stability, are not allowed by Party discipline.

In stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation, all cadres and the masses, people of all ethnic groups and sectors, and comrades in all sectors must guard their posts, follow political, factory, and school discipline, maintain normal work, production, and study order, and absolutely not engage in any activities that harm stability and unity.

All students must prioritize the overall situation and the fundamental interests of the country and the people, immediately stop parades, sit-ins, and other actions. Those who have stopped classes must unconditionally resume classes. Students' legitimate demands and reasonable opinions must be expressed and reflected through democratic and legal normal channels. Immediately remove "democracy walls" and "freedom walls," and strictly prohibit the repetition of the Cultural Revolution.

In stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation, we must distinguish between the vast majority of young students and the few who intentionally create turmoil. We must protect the patriotic enthusiasm and good intentions of the vast majority of young students and not pursue their excessive actions. We will continue to conduct dialogues at multiple levels and through multiple channels with them. For students' reasonable demands, we will give clear answers. Some reasonable criticisms and suggestions, such as eliminating corruption, punishing "official profiteering," overcoming bureaucratism, etc., will be seriously considered by the Party and the government to improve our work.

Jilin Province: On May 20, the Party and government organs in Jilin Province and Changchun City, and the broad Party members and cadres, seriously studied Comrade Li Peng's speech. Everyone expressed their firm support for Comrade Li Peng's speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, and the central government's and the State Council's resolute measures. They vowed to take action, clearly oppose the turmoil, and with their actions of following discipline, guarding their posts, and doing a good job in production and work, contribute to restoring normal order and stabilizing the situation.

The broad Party members and cadres in the provincial direct organs, during the discussion, believed that stabilizing the situation is the current overall situation. We must firmly maintain this overall situation. If we do not stop this turbulent situation, our country's reform and construction will not be able to proceed.

Anhui Province: On May 20, the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Political Consultative Conference studied and discussed Comrade Li Peng's important speech at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Leadership Meeting. They unanimously agreed that at this critical moment, the central government's decisive measures to stop the turmoil are very necessary and timely. Everyone expressed their firm support and resolute implementation, and vowed to use Comrade Li Peng's speech to unify thoughts and understandings. The Provincial Party Committee proposed the following opinions for implementation:

1. Require all levels of Party Committee leadership classes to hold emergency meetings, study Comrade Li Peng's speech, unify thoughts, understand the nature of this struggle, and firmly align politically with the Party Central Committee.

2. Take various measures to stabilize the overall situation. From now on, require all places and units, especially colleges and universities, to do everything possible to do ideological work, educate students not to parade or sit-in, not to connect and go to Beijing to support, and to resume classes unconditionally as soon as possible.

3. Strictly prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation to engage in arson, looting, and other criminal activities. If such problems occur, public security organs must take decisive measures to arrest criminals on the spot, and severely and swiftly crack down on and publicly expose them according to law.

4. Require all levels of organs, all enterprises and public institutions, and the broad cadres and workers to guard their posts, fulfill their duties, maintain normal work order, study order, production order, and living order.

5. Require news and publicity departments to strictly follow propaganda discipline, timely and correctly propagate the spirit of the central government's instructions, and ensure that all propaganda is conducive to maintaining and stabilizing the overall situation.

We require all levels of Party Committee leaders and the broad Party members, at this critical moment, to be clear-cut, truly align with the Party Central Committee in thought and politics, maintain their beliefs, and with their actions, stop the turmoil and maintain the overall situation of stability and unity.

Tibet Autonomous Region: The people of all ethnic groups in Tibet believe that the important speech by Premier Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council is very timely, and they firmly support it. The Regional Party Committee and Government, in light of Tibet's actual situation, have put forward the following requirements for the broad Party members, cadres, and workers:

1. Definitely follow the principles, firmly implement Premier Li Peng's important speech, and maintain normal work and living order.

2. With actual actions, maintain the Party's leadership, maintain the socialist system, maintain national unity and ethnic unity, and complete the tasks of "two hands" proposed by the Regional Party Committee.

3. For their children, continue to do persuasion and education work, explain the situation, and not participate in gatherings, parades, and onlookers.

4. Require all teaching and administrative staff to continue to do ideological work for the students and quickly restore normal teaching order.

Heilongjiang Province: The main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Government, the Provincial People's Congress, and the Provincial Political Consultative Conference collectively and seriously studied and discussed Comrade Li Peng's important speech on behalf of the CPC Central Committee. Everyone unanimously agreed that in recent days, the situation in Beijing has affected many cities across the country. The main cities in our province have also seen large-scale parades, petitions, and sit-ins. Some colleges and universities have stopped classes and meals, seriously affecting normal production order, work order, traffic order, and living order. These situations show that, as Comrade Li Peng pointed out in his speech: our country's reform and opening up and the four modernizations, the future and destiny of the People's Republic, are facing serious threats. According to the decision of the CPC Central Committee, the Party Central Committee and the State Council require us to urgently mobilize, clearly oppose the turmoil, restore social normal order, maintain stability and unity, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization. This decisive decision is correct, and we fully support it. We must firmly implement the Party Central Committee's decision, according to the spirit of Comrade Li Peng's important speech, continue to do a good job in maintaining the stable and united political situation in our province.

Based on full discussion and improved understanding, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government held a meeting of the heads of provincial direct departments, colleges and universities, and large enterprises in Harbin this afternoon. Comrade Sun Weiben, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, spoke on the opinions of implementing the decision of the CPC Central Committee Standing Committee. At the same time, a notice was sent to all cities, regions, and provincial direct departments on seriously studying Comrade Li Peng's important speech. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government require:

1. All levels of Party Committees and Governments must immediately organize Party members, cadres, and people from all walks of life to seriously study the speeches by Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun. All levels of Party and government leaders must take the lead in studying well. At the same time, educate and guide the broad Party members, cadres, and people from all walks of life to correctly analyze the current situation, unify their thoughts with the spirit of Comrade Li Peng's important speech, and make everyone consciously and clearly oppose the turmoil from thought to action.

2. Take effective measures to ensure the stability of the political situation in our province. All levels and types of schools must maintain normal teaching order. Those who have stopped classes must unconditionally resume classes, and actively dissuade all parade activities based on the principle of being responsible to society and the people. All large and small posters on the streets must be immediately removed. All industrial and commercial enterprises and public institutions must follow labor discipline and maintain normal production order. All public security personnel and armed police must further maintain traffic order, social order, strengthen social security, and firmly crack down on all illegal and criminal activities. State organ workers must guard their posts, fulfill their duties, maintain normal work order. Party members must strictly follow Party discipline, not only not participate in any activities that harm stability and unity but also play a leading and exemplary role in uniting the masses and stabilizing the situation.

3. Pay attention to policy implementation and continue to do a good job in ideological and political work as before. The current situation in our province is basically stable, but we must not be complacent. The future work is arduous, and we need to do patient and painstaking ideological work to stabilize the political situation. Solving ideological problems must prevent simplification and adopt methods of guidance and persuasion. We must continue to protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad young students, distinguish them from the few who intentionally create turmoil, and not pursue their excessive actions. Not only that, the Party and the government's dialogues with the broad students and people from all walks of life, including those who have participated in parades, demonstrations, class strikes, and hunger strikes, will continue to be conducted actively and broadly through multiple levels, channels, and forms, to fully listen to opinions from all sides. For students' and people's reasonable demands, we will give clear answers. For their reasonable criticisms and suggestions, such as punishing "official profiteering," eliminating corruption, overcoming bureaucratism, stabilizing prices, and improving public security, we will seriously listen to and adopt them, and improve the Party and government's work with actual steps.

4. Under the premise of ensuring social stability, we must focus on production in agriculture and industry and other work. Currently, our province's economic life has many urgent problems to be solved. The drought in rural areas is serious, and industrial enterprises have many difficulties. All levels of Party Committees, Governments, and their departments must, based on a high sense of responsibility to the Party and the people, strengthen their leadership over their regions and units, and seriously grasp various reform and construction work. Currently, the key is to further rectify and reform, resolutely implement the measures of the "383 Project" to stabilize prices in our province, ensure an effective increase in supply, and stabilize the market. We must organize Party and government organs and relevant departments to go deep into the front line of agricultural production, strengthen guidance and service, and work with the broad grassroots cadres and the masses to do a good job in drought resistance and seedling protection, laying the foundation for a bumper harvest this year. We must strengthen the command and dispatch of industrial production, ease the tense situation of funds, electricity, energy, raw materials, and transportation, and strive to improve labor productivity and economic benefits.

    在充分讨论、提高认识的基础上，省委、省政府于今日下午召开了省直各部门、在哈尔滨的大专院校和大企业领导干部会议。孙维本同志代表省委、省政府讲了贯彻中央政治局常委会决定的意见。同时，向各市、地和省直各部门发出了《关于认真学习李鹏同志重要讲话的通知》。省委、省政府要求：
    一、各级党委、政府要立即组织党员、干部和社会各界群众认真学习李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的讲话。各级党政领导干部要带头学好。同时，教育引导广大党员干部和各界群众清醒、正确地分析当前形势，把思想统一到李鹏同志重要讲话的精神上来，使大家从思想到行动都自觉地、旗帜鲜明地反对动乱。
    二、采取有效措施，确保我省政治局面的稳定。各级各类学校都应坚持正常的教学秩序，凡罢课的应无条件地复课，并本着向社会和人民负责的原则，积极劝阻一切游行活动。对街头上张贴的大小字报要立即予以清除。所有工商企业和事业单位都要遵守劳动纪律，维护正常的生产秩序。全体公安干警和武装警察要进一步努力维护交通秩序、社会秩序，强化社会治安，坚决打击各种违法犯罪活动。国家机关工作人员必须坚守岗位，忠于职守，维护正常工作秩序。共产党员必须严格遵守党的纪律，不仅不参与任何损害安定团结的活动，而且要在团结群众、稳定局势中发挥先锋模范作用。
    三、要注意掌握政策，一如既往地做好思想政治工作。我省形势目前已基本稳定，但不能麻痹松懈，今后的工作是艰巨的，要稳定政治局面还需要做艰苦耐心的思想工作。解决思想认识上的问题要防止简单化，采取疏导和说服的办法。仍然要坚持保护广大青年学生的爱国热情，把他们同制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来，对他们在学潮中的过激言行不予追究。不但如此，党和政府同广大学生和各界人士之间的对话，包括同参加过游行、示威、罢课、绝食的学生之间的对话，还将通过多种层次、多种渠道、多种形式广泛积极地进行，以充分听取各方面的意见。对学生和各界群众提出的合理要求，要给以明确的答复，对他们提出的合理批评和建议，如惩治官倒、消除腐败、克服官僚主义、稳定物价、搞好治安等，要认真听取和采纳，以实际步骤改进党和政府的工作。
    四、在确保社会稳定的前提下，要集中精力抓好工农业生产和其它各项工作。当前，我省经济生活中存在着许多亟待解决的难题。农村旱情严重，工业企业困难很多。各级党委、政府和所属部门要本着对党和人民高度负责的精神，切实加强对所属地区和单位的领导，认真抓好各项改革和建设工作。当前突出的是要进一步搞好治理整顿，坚决落实稳定我省物价的“３８３工程”的各项措施，确保有效供给的增加和市场的稳定。要组织党政机关和有关部门干部深入农业生产第一线，加强指导和服务，与广大基层干部群众一起搞好抗旱保苗，为夺取今年农业丰收打下基础。要加强工业生产的指挥调度，缓解资金、电力、能源、原材料和运输的紧张状况，努力提高劳动生产率和经济效益。
