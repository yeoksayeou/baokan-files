	People's Daily, compiled from reports by our correspondents in various locations: Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guangzhou, and Fuzhou, some university students held parades on May 4th to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement.

	Carrying forward the spirit of May Fourth and promoting reform and opening up is the main theme of this student parade. The slogans in the parade queues in various places mainly include: Support the Communist Party, oppose corruption and official profiteering, build the country on science, freedom of the press, rebuild the national spirit, revive the greatness, patriotism is not a crime, and long live democracy.

	Students generally demand equal dialogue with government officials. Students in Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Wuhan also submitted petitions to local governments. In Shaanxi, Deputy Governor Sun Daren met with student representatives and accepted the petition. The relevant departments of the provincial government expressed that they would dialogue with students within a week. Students who paraded on May 4th did not clash with the police maintaining order, but due to the large number of onlookers, traffic was congested in some places.

　　津沪等地高校    
    部分学生游行
    本报综合消息  据本报驻各地记者报道：天津、上海、武汉、杭州、西安、兰州、广州和福州等城市的部分高校学生４日举行了纪念五四运动７０周年的游行活动。
    弘扬五四精神，推进改革开放，是这次学生游行活动的主旋律。各地游行队伍中的口号主要有：拥护共产党，反对腐败、打倒官倒，科学立国、新闻自由，再造民魂、重振雄风，爱国无罪、民主万岁等。
    游行学生普遍提出要与政府官员平等对话。西安、兰州、武汉等地的游行学生还向当地政府递交了请愿书。在陕西，副省长孙达人接见了学生代表，并接下了请愿书，省府有关方面表示一周内要与学生对话。４日游行的学生与维持秩序的警方没有发生冲突，但由于围观群众较多，有的地方一度交通堵塞。
