**Reflections on Welfare - A Conversation with Liu Ruizhong of the National Institute of Economic System Reform**

**People's Daily Reporter: Dong Huangliang**

**A Low-Income Welfare State**

"Currently, China has become a low-income welfare state," Liu Ruizhong, a young scholar at the National Institute of Economic System Reform, stated bluntly during the reporter's visit. He believes that the generalization of welfare has narrowed the scope for urban reforms, making the reforms more arduous.

Things that are taken for granted are often overlooked or not deeply understood. Welfare is one such example. Beyond humanitarian considerations for relief, government-subsidized low-priced food, water, and electricity, various units providing employees with a plethora of goods—from poultry to meat, fish, and more—there is also free medical care and housing. All of these are forms of welfare. Liu Ruizhong said: "Compared to India and other low-income countries, China's per capita income is only slightly higher, but the proportion of public consumption to the national income is much higher; compared to middle and upper-middle-income developing countries, China's per capita income is several hundred to over a thousand dollars lower, but the proportion of public consumption to the national income is 4.1% higher. International comparisons show that China, despite its low per capita income, has a significantly higher level of social welfare compared to other developing countries."

**Historical Causes of the Current Welfare Situation**

Discussing the process that led to China's current welfare situation, Liu Ruizhong pointed out that since the early days of liberation, China's centralized planned economy, in order to accumulate financial and material resources and achieve rapid industrialization, implemented low wages while providing limited welfare goods to ensure basic living needs. People saw this as a manifestation of socialist superiority. In recent years, after the state began levying bonus taxes, welfare, as a non-taxable distribution channel, rapidly expanded—welfare goods were provided at excessive levels and beyond the intended scope. In 1985, the total wage income of urban workers in China was 175.885 billion yuan, while the total value of various non-wage material consumption was 158.639 billion yuan. In other words, welfare had risen to approximately 90% of wage income and was continuing to increase rapidly, becoming the "biggest chunk" of "grey income" in society.

**Welfare Generalization Reduces Reform Space**

Whether it is "welfareization" or the "generalization of welfare," it is mainly "welfare" in the cities, "welfare" among urban employed populations and other residents. Reviewing and reflecting on the decade of reform, we observe a phenomenon: the lower the level of welfare in a region (such as rural areas), the faster and more effective the reform; conversely, the higher the level of welfare in a region (such as cities, especially large cities), the more constrained the reform, making progress slower. Of course, the factors influencing the pace of urban reform are complex, but the welfare situation is also an important factor. Liu Ruizhong analyzed it as follows:

- The fluctuation of social welfare seems like a "one-way street," it can only move forward and is difficult to retreat, known as the "welfare rigidity." Under the restriction of this "one-way street," in the initial stage of reform, it was only possible to adopt a dual-track system, maintaining the supply of original and expanded welfare products through the planned system, and only the surplus part could circulate as commodities in the market. This undoubtedly narrows the operating space for the new system.

- Production, supply, and sales form a complete chain. The low price (or free) at which welfare products are distributed inevitably requires raw material supply, production energy, and other costs to be maintained at low prices. This increases the difficulty of rationalizing the price system. If prices are not rationalized, many enterprises will still suffer "policy-related losses," making it difficult to implement the Bankruptcy Law and also affecting fair competition among enterprises.

- The disparity in welfare among various units, sometimes even significantly, will inevitably strengthen barriers to labor mobility and hinder the reform of the labor system. In recent years, the "household registration price" and "work certificate price" that have appeared in the labor market are actually backed by welfare benefits, making many employees who want to transfer positions hesitate due to the high cost.

- The distribution of welfare is generally in the form of goods or price subsidies for goods, with obvious characteristics of the "iron rice bowl." For the recipients, welfare is a kind of entitlement income, difficult to link with labor, and does not have an incentive effect. Not only that, the generalization of welfare also fosters an incorrect "debt" concept among employees, as if the distribution of welfare is the unit repaying a "debt"; if they do not receive it, they believe the unit and the government are "in debt," otherwise, they will "complain."

Welfare generalization not only directly affects the market-oriented direction of reform but also, social welfare expenditures increase significantly every year. Just the price subsidies from 1978 to 1986 increased by 2.74 times, driving fiscal deficits and inflation. This will inevitably make the reform environment tighter and narrower.

**A New Welfare Concept Should Be Established**

"People have noticed the drawbacks of excessive welfareization. However, 'guaranteeing life from cradle to grave' has always been seen as the most brilliant embodiment of socialist superiority. It seems that this issue should be fully understood," the reporter said.

"That's right," Liu Ruizhong said, "The socialist welfare system guarantees the basic living and normal working needs of employees, indeed having its superior aspects. However, everything has its limits. Providing each laborer with a 'bowl of porridge' is acceptable, but if the quantity and quality of the 'porridge' are blindly expanded, not only will the state and units eventually be unable to bear the burden, but it will also often cause disputes among employees."

Therefore, he advocates that welfare funds should still adhere to the principle of fairness, distributed according to the standard of guaranteeing basic living and normal working needs. Insist on "snow in winter," do not "add flowers to brocade." Currently, various improperly expanded welfare benefits should be cleaned up and abolished. "Only by breaking free from the heavy shackles of welfare can the deepening of reform have greater space."

　　对福利的思考
    ——与国家体改所刘瑞中一席谈
    本报记者  董焕亮
    低收入的福利国家
    “目前，中国已成为一个低收入的福利国家。”记者到国家经济体制改革研究所采访时，青年学者刘瑞中开宗明义地讲。他认为，福利的泛化使城市改革的余地变得狭小，加重了改革的艰巨性。
    习以为常的事物，一般人往往视而不见，或见得不深。福利，即其一。且不说基于人道主义考虑的救济性福利，政府补贴的低价供给的食品、水电，各单位向职工发放的名目繁多的实物——鸡鸭鱼肉“应有尽有”，还有公费医疗、住房，不都是福利么？刘瑞中说：“与印度及其他低收入国家相比，我国人均收入仅略高于它们，但公共消费占国民生产总值的比例要高得多；与中下等和中上等收入的发展中国家相比，我国人均收入分别低几百美元，逾千美元，但公共消费占国民生产总值的比例却要高４．１％。国际比较证明，我国在人均收入低的情况下，社会福利化程度明显高于发展中国家的一般水平。”
    形成的历史原因
    谈到我国福利现状形成的过程，刘瑞中指出，从解放初期开始，我国的集中型计划经济为了积聚财力、物力，谋求高速度实现工业化，在普遍实行低工资的同时，有限度地发放福利品，以保证人民的基本生活需要。人们把它视为社会主义优越性的体现。近些年，在国家征收奖金税以后，作为一条不纳税的分配渠道，福利像漫溢之水，迅速泛化——福利品超水平，超范围地发放。１９８５年，我国城镇职工各种工资性收入总额为１７５８．８５亿元，而各类非工资性实物消费总额共达１５８6．３９亿元，也就是说，福利，已涨到约相当于工资性收入９０％的水平，而且涨势强劲，已构成社会上“灰色收入”的“大头”。
    福利泛化使改革余地变小
    无论是“福利化”，还是“福利的泛化”，主要地都是“化”在城市里，“化”在城市就业人口和其他居民中。回顾和反思十年改革历程，我们观察到一个现象：福利水平越低的地区（如农村），改革推进快且成效显著；相反，福利水平越高的地区（如城市，尤其是大城市），改革受到严重束缚因而推进较慢。当然，影响城市改革进程的因素是复杂的，但福利状况如何，也是个重要原因。刘瑞中作了如下分析：
    ——社会福利的变动似一条“单行道”，只可向前，很难后退，即所谓“福利刚性”。受到这条“单行道”的刚性限制，在改革起步阶段，便只能采取双轨制的办法，通过计划体制维持原有的和扩大的福利产品的供给，超额的增量部分才能作为商品在市场流通。这无疑缩小了新体制运行空间。——产、供、销形成完整的链条，福利产品发放的低价（或无价），势必要求原料供应、生产能源等等都维持低价水平。从而增加了理顺价格体系的难度。价格理不顺，很多企业“政策性亏损”依旧，《破产法》便很难实行，也影响企业之间开展公平竞争。
    ——各单位之间福利参差不齐，甚至相差悬殊，必然强化劳动力流动壁垒，阻滞劳动制度的改革。近年来，在劳务市场上出现的要价颇高的“户口价格”和“工作证价格”，实际上有福利待遇作为背景，它使很多想要调动的职工望“价”却步。
    ——福利的发放，一般采取实物或实物的价格补贴形式，带有明显的“大锅饭”性质。对于享有者来说，福利是一种权利性收入，很难与劳动相联系，起不到激励作用。非但如此，福利泛化还使职工滋生一种不正确的“债权”观念，仿佛发放福利是单位补还“欠帐”；若得不到，则认定是单位和政府“欠帐”，否则便“骂娘”。
    福利泛化，不仅直接影响了改革的市场取向，而且，社会福利费用每年都有大幅度增长，仅价格补贴在１９７８年到１９８６年间就增长了２．７４倍，推动了财政赤字和通货膨胀。这势必使改革的环境趋紧趋狭。
    应树立新的福利观
    “过分的福利化带来的弊病，其实人们也有所觉察。可‘生老病死有保障’，又一直被看作社会主义优越性最有光彩的写照。看来，对于这个问题应当有全面的认识。”记者说。
    “是这样的。”刘瑞中说，“社会主义福利制度保障了职工基本生活和正常工作的需要，确具有其优越性的一面。但是，凡事皆需有度。供给每个劳动者一杯‘羹’是可以的，如若盲目地扩大‘羹’的数量和质量，不仅终致国家负担不起，单位负担不起，职工之间也往往会引起纷争。”
    因此，他主张福利经费还是应遵循公平的原则，按照保障基本生活和正常工作需要的标准发放。坚持“雪中送炭”，不搞“锦上添花”。当前，应通过清理整顿，取消擅自扩大的各种巧立名目的福利待遇。“挣脱了福利的重重羁绊，改革的深化才能有较大的空间。”
