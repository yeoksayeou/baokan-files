    Ineffective Cleanup and Acceptance of Banquets Lead to Removal of Hunan Vice-Governor Yang Huichuan

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Changsha, May 15 — Because of his ineffective handling of the cleanup of companies and acceptance of banquets, Yang Huichuan was removed from his position as Vice-Governor of Hunan Province during the seventh session of the second meeting of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, which concluded today.

    During the opening of the second session of the seventh Hunan Provincial People's Congress on May 5, many delegates criticized the Hunan Provincial Government and its relevant departments for their ineffective handling of the cleanup of companies and the punishment of officials involved in corruption. Additionally, 31 delegates submitted an inquiry to the provincial government and relevant departments regarding certain issues with the Hunan International Economic Development Company. Vice-Governor Yang Huichuan, who is also the head of the Hunan Provincial Company Cleanup and Rectification Leading Group, along with relevant department heads, held a discussion and provided a verbal response to the issues raised by the delegates and the 31 delegates' inquiry. Many delegates were dissatisfied with Yang Huichuan's speech and verbal response. After the inquiry session, 177 delegates from the Changsha City and Shaoyang City delegations proposed a motion to remove Yang Huichuan from his position as Vice-Governor, citing his ineffective handling of the company cleanup, his ineffective handling of issues with the Hunan International Economic Development Company, and his acceptance of a banquet from a Hunan company during the Canton Fair in Guangzhou last year, where he and a family member dined with 15 people, costing over 4,000 yuan (Yang reimbursed 1,000 yuan after receiving a complaint from the Provincial People's Congress). The vote resulted in 506 out of the 766 delegates present voting in favor of the removal, exceeding half of the 870 delegates of the Provincial People's Congress.

    After the removal motion passed, some delegates joyfully remarked, "The rubber stamp image of the People's Congress is starting to change!"

　　清理整顿公司不力接受宴请    
    湖南副省长杨汇泉被省人代会罢免
    本报长沙５月１５日电  记者吴兴华报道：因清理整顿公司不力和接受宴请等问题，在今天结束的湖南省第七届人代会第二次会议上，杨汇泉被罢免湖南省人民政府副省长职务。
    在５月５日开幕的湖南省七届人大二次会议上，许多人大代表就湖南清理整顿公司和惩治官倒不力等问题向省政府及其有关部门提出了严厉的批评，同时还有３１名代表就湖南国际经济开发公司的一些问题向省政府及有关部门提出了质询案。副省长、省清理整顿公司领导小组组长杨汇泉以及政府有关部门负责人就代表们提出的问题和３１名代表提出的质询案进行了一次座谈和一次口头答复。相当多的代表对杨汇泉的谈话和口头答复很不满意。质询会后，长沙市、邵阳市等地、市代表团的１７７名代表以杨汇泉清理整顿公司不力、处理湖南国际经济开发公司的问题不力、去年在广州参加春季商品交易会期间，他和他的一名亲属接受湖南某公司宴请，１５个人一顿吃掉４０００多元（杨在接到省人大转给的群众反映后，曾补交１０００元宴席费）等理由，提出了罢免杨汇泉副省长职务的提案。表决结果，参加会议的７６６名代表赞成罢免的有５０６票，超过省人代会８７０名代表的半数。
    罢免案通过后，有的代表高兴地说：“人代会的橡皮图章形象开始改变了！”
