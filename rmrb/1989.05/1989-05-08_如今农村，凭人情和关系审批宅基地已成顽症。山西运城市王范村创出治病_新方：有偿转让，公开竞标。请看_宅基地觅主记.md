On April 25th, the threshing ground in Wangfan Village, Yuncheng City, Shanxi Province, was bustling like a market. A large banner read: "Wangfan Village Residential Land Paid Transfer Bidding Meeting," attracting hundreds of villagers. After a representative from the Land Management Bureau announced the document regarding the village's residential land, the villagers surged towards another location.

This was an abandoned old brick kiln site, overgrown with weeds and uneven. However, white chalk lines had already divided the area into residential plots. The village had determined a "base price" for each plot based on its quality and marked them with numbers and boundary stones. Everything was ready, and each plot of residential land was seeking its owner.

"Plot 39, area 3.67 mu, base price 610 yuan. Tickets—" As soon as the village committee deputy director, Fan Yubiao, finished announcing, a whistle blew, and six bidders came forward to receive their tickets. The reporter took a look and saw that they were receiving "Residential Land Bidding Intention Cards."

"The highest bid for the first round is 680 yuan!" Fan Yubiao announced the result of the first round of bidding. The bidders received their tickets again. I hurriedly asked, "Why bid again?" Old Fan said, "If there are no objections from the bidders after one round, there is no need to bid again. If there is another bidder who wants to bid, they can bid again, but no more than three times. Because all the bidders have been strictly vetted and have the qualifications to receive the residential land, under the same conditions, the one with the highest bid will be given priority..."

"Liu Ming, 980 yuan, successful bid!" As Old Fan said this, he struck the drum with a stick, "Boom!" sealing the deal. At this moment, a young man with glasses pushed his way into the crowd and leaned over the drum, signing the "Residential Land Use Certificate" on the spot. The on-site staff also filled out the "Residential Land Construction Permit" and "Land Use Certificate." After Liu Ming signed, he hurriedly turned and left. I asked Old Fan, "What's going on?" He said, "Whoever wins the bid goes back to get the money and pays on the spot. Once the money is paid, the certificate is issued."

"The next plot, 38..." The bidding continued. At this time, the village committee director, Fan Diantang, walked over and told the reporter, "This year, our village has planned 60 plots of residential land, all of which will be allocated using this method. In the past few years, our village had more than 80 households filing lawsuits over residential land disputes, some even appealing to the central government. Since this method was implemented, there have been no more lawsuits." Just as he was speaking, an old farmer interjected, "This method is good. Whoever wins the bid gets it, no more need to kowtow and beg for favors!"

　　如今农村，凭人情和关系审批宅基地已成顽症。山西运城市王范村创出治病新方：有偿转让，公开竞标。请看——    
    宅基地觅主记
    毛志远
    ４月２５日中午，山西运城市王范村打麦场上热闹得像赶集。一条大横幅：王范村宅基地有偿转让竞投会，吸引来数百村民。当土地管理局一位同志宣布了关于该村宅基地的批文后，村民们便向另一个地方涌动。
    这是一块废弃旧砖窑地，杂草丛生，凸凹不平。但一道道白灰线已将此地分割成宅基地。村里根据地势优劣确定了“底价”，并逐一编号，打下界石。万事俱备，一块块宅基地寻觅着各自的主人。
    “３９号院，面积３分６厘７，底价６１０元。发票——”村委会副主任樊宇彪刚宣布完，随着“叽——”一声哨响，６户竞投者相继前来领票。记者凑过去一看，领的是“宅基地竞投意向卡”。
    “第一次竞投最高价６８０元！”樊宇彪宣布第一次竞投结果，竞投者再次领了票。我忙问：“为什么还要投？”老樊说：“如果一次，竞投者没意见就不投了，假如还有一个竞投者还要投就再投，但最多不超过３次。因为参投者都是经严格审查具有给宅基地的资格，在同等条件下优先给投标高的……”
    “刘明，９８０元中标！”老樊说着，抡起鼓棒“咚”一声，一锤定音。这时，只见一位戴眼镜的小伙子挤进人群，扒在圆鼓上，当场在“宅基地使用证”上签了字。在场的工作人员也动手填写“宅基地施工许可证”、“土地使用证”。刘明签字后，急忙转身走了。我问老樊“怎么回事？”他说：“谁中了标马上回去拿钱，当场兑现，钱拿来就发证。”
    “下一块，３８号院……”竞投继续下去。这时，村委会主任樊点堂走过来告诉记者：“今年我村共规划６０块宅基地，一律实行这种办法。前些年，我村因宅基地纠纷有８０多户告状，有的还告到中央，这个办法一实行就没人告了。”正说着，一位老农插话说：“这法子好，谁投中是谁的，再不用磕头说好话啦！”
