Rationalizing Freight Rates to Escape the Dilemma

Gong Shuqing, Director of Hohhot Railway Bureau

Railway investment is insufficient, and it is impossible to alleviate this situation immediately given the country's financial difficulties. Even if funds were available, due to the long construction cycles of railways, it would not be possible to see immediate effects. Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to take decisive and effective measures to rationalize freight rates to escape the current dilemma. This can be approached from two aspects:

First, the most pressing issue in railway passenger transport is the severe overcapacity of passengers, leading to difficulties in purchasing tickets and boarding, chaotic station and train order, and some sections have reached a disastrous level. Therefore, it is urgent to take measures to reduce the number of passengers. I believe that first, passenger ticket prices should be raised as soon as possible, the earlier the better, the earlier the more proactive. By using economic means to control part of the passenger flow, and supplemented by strict administrative measures to control national conferences and domestic group tours, the passenger flow can be effectively controlled, giving the railways a chance to breathe; it also helps to reduce the floating population in cities and stabilize social order.

Second, the current difficulty in freight transport is mainly reflected in the insufficient capacity of trunk railways, especially in remote railway bureaus. Therefore, with the process of rectifying and improving the national economy, at an appropriate time, freight rates should be adjusted to ease the freight transport difficulties, and increase railway investments. Freight rates can be adjusted incrementally, gradually reaching the target. By 1990, the price per ton-kilometer can be increased by 3 to 5 fen, and during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, it can be increased by about 2 fen per year. In this way, over six years, the total revenue from freight rates can increase by more than 500 billion yuan. This is of great significance for railway construction. After deducting the increase in prices, there can still be a considerable amount of funds invested in new line construction and repayment of debts, laying a good foundation for railway transport to escape the valley and adapt to the development of the national economy.

　　理顺运价　走出困境
    呼和浩特铁路局局长  宫树清
    铁路投资不足，在国家财政困难的情况下不可能马上得到缓解。退一步讲，就是有了钱，由于铁路建设周期长，也不可能立即见效。因此，我认为必须采取果断而有力的措施，理顺运价关系，才能摆脱当前困境。可以从两方面入手：
    第一，目前铁路客运上的突出难点是旅客严重地超出了运输能力，带来买票难、乘车难，站车秩序混乱，个别区段已到了灾难性的程度。因此采取措施将乘车人数降下来是当务之急。我认为首先客运票价应尽早提价，越早越好，越早越主动。通过经济手段控制部分客流量，再辅以坚决的行政手段严格控制全国性会议、国内团体旅游。这样可使客流量切实得到控制，使铁路得到喘息的机会；还有助于减少城市流动人口，稳定社会治安秩序。
    第二，当前货运难突出表现在干线铁路运能不足，特别是边远铁路局尤为突出。因此，应随着国民经济整顿治理的过程，在适当时机调整货运价格，以缓解货运困难局面，并增加铁路的投入，货运价格可以采用微调起步，逐步到位的办法。一九九○年每吨公里提价三至五厘，“八五”期间每年增加二厘左右。这样，六年时间，运价总收入可增加五百多亿元。这对于铁路建设有着重大意义，除去物价上涨支出外，还可以有较多的资金投入新线建设，归还欠账，为铁路运输走出峡谷，适应国民经济的发展打下良好基础。
