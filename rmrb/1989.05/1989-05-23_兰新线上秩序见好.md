After your newspaper published the letter from a reader titled "Thieves Run Rampant on the Lanxin Line, Passengers Harmed with No One to Manage" on the sixth page on March 29, the leadership of our bureau instructed the public security and passenger transport departments to take effective measures to rectify the 243 train. Before your newspaper published this letter, our bureau had also heard some public feedback.

In late February of this year, our bureau designated the 501 and 502 trains from Lanzhou to Yumen, the 243 and 244 trains from Lanzhou to Xinjiang Urumqi, and the 601 and 602 trains from Qinghai Xining to Tianshui as key targets for rectification. Based on strengthening management and strictly controlling four checkpoints (the car door checkpoint, ticket check checkpoint, boarding checkpoint, and cleaning checkpoint), our bureau publicly arrested a group of criminals who seriously disrupted the railway public order.

Currently, the public order on these trains has improved.

　　兰新线上秩序见好
    你报３月２９日第六版刊登《兰新线上盗贼横行，旅客受害竟无人管》的读者来信后，我局领导人批示公安、客运等部门采取有力措施，对２４３次列车进行整顿。你报发表这封来信前，我局也听到过一些群众反映。
    今年２月下旬，我局将兰州至玉门的５０１、５０２次，兰州至新疆乌鲁木齐的２４３、２４４次和青海西宁至天水的６０１、６０２次列车作为重点整顿对象。我局在加强管理，严把４关（即车门关、验票关、上车关、清理关）的基础上，公开逮捕了一批严重扰乱铁路治安秩序的犯罪分子。
    目前，这几次列车的治安秩序已见好转。
