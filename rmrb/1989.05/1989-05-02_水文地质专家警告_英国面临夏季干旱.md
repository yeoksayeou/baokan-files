	Hydrologists have warned that Britain is facing a summer drought more severe than the 1976 drought. The drought will seriously affect the supply of public water and cause water bodies to dry up, leading to the death of aquatic plants and animals.

	The British magazine *New Scientist* reported that this warning was issued by researchers from the British Hydrological Society and the Geological Survey, based on the unprecedented drought conditions experienced in Britain and most of Europe from last November to this January.

	During these three months, the average rainfall in England and Wales was 130-135 millimeters, the lowest since 1879 and the driest months on record for England. Terry Marsh of the Geological Survey in Wallingford and his colleagues believe that the drought was caused by a high-pressure system that lingered over continental Europe.

	Marsh said that the drought of last winter and this spring has caused the water levels in some rivers in Hampshire and Sussex to drop lower than before the severe summer drought of 1976. If the summer climate remains dry, it will result in a drought worse than 1976. The current water demand, which is 17% higher than then, will make the consequences of the drought even more severe. Drought will not only directly affect human life but will also seriously damage the natural environment of fish and other aquatic plants and animals.

### 水文地质专家警告  英国面临夏季干旱

    英国面临夏季干旱
    新华社北京４月３０日电  英国水文地质专家们警告说，英国正面临比１９７６年旱灾更严重的夏季干旱，干旱将严重影响公用水的供给和导致水域干涸，水生动植物死亡。
    英国《新科学家》杂志报道说，这一警告是英国水文学研究所和地质调查局的研究人员，依据去年１１月至今年１月间英国和欧洲大部分地区遭受前所未有的干旱情况提出的。
    在去冬今春的这３个月中，英格兰和威尔士的总降雨量平均为１３０—１３５毫米，这是自１８７９年以来最低的降雨量，也是英格兰有史以来最干旱的月份。沃灵福德地质调查局的特里·马什和他的同事们认为，干旱是由滞留在欧洲大陆上空的高气压造成的。
    马什说，去冬今春的干旱使汉普郡和萨塞克斯的一些河流水位比１９７６年严重夏季旱灾前期的还低。如果今年夏季气候连续干旱，这将会造成比１９７６年更大的干旱，而目前的需水量比当时增多了１７％的事实将使干旱的后果更为严重。干旱不仅直接影响人类的生活，而且还会对鱼类及其他水生动植物的自然环境造成严重破坏。
