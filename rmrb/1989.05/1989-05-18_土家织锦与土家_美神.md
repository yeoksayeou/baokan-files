In February of this year, U.S. President Bush and his wife visited China. Premier Li Peng and his wife presented them with two Flying Pigeon bicycles and two lesser-known Tujia embroidered pouches from Xiangxi, Hunan. The Tujia people living in Longshan, Jishou in Hunan, and Laifeng in Hubei were all thrilled by this gesture.

In early spring, we saw the colorful Tujia weaving in Xiangxi and met the "Tujia Beauty Goddess," the elderly woman Ye Yucui.

Tujia weaving, known as "Xilan Kapu" in the Tujia language, means "flowered bed cover." It is a traditional Tujia folk handicraft, with all weaving processes done by hand. It has nearly 200 traditional patterns, said to be unparalleled in the world.

The patterns on Tujia weaving mainly depict animals, common household items, ethnic customs, historical events, and some are inspired by plants. There are also patterns influenced by Han culture. Locals say that birds and beasts, cats and dogs, all come to life under the skilled hands of the weaving girls. The flowers on the weaving can captivate butterflies and confuse bees. The weaving that reflects the Tujia people's daily life exudes the aroma of their glutinous rice cakes, fried tofu, and corn liquor, filled with the warmth and intimacy of human life.

Walking into the Longshan Nationality Weaving Factory and the Jishou Arts and Crafts Research Institute, the ancient and pure atmosphere of the looms and weaving girls, and the beauty of the woven products, all leave a deep impression.

A piece titled "Wedding Procession" vividly depicts the bride, groom, sedan chair, officials, guests, flag bearers, drummers, musicians, horsemen, and carriers of the bride's dowry, capturing the essence of a Tujia wedding procession.

A series of reverse-interlaced, parallel, symmetrical triangular patterns in black, white, and brown colors—what are they? They are "Swallow Flowers." There are no swallows, no beaks, no wings in the pattern. At first glance, it seems like nothing, but upon closer inspection, you can almost hear the murmuring of pairs of swallows and see rows of swallows flying towards the distant blue sky.

Similarly, a piece titled "Nine Plum Blossoms" is composed of red, green, purple, and yellow diamond shapes. Up close, it doesn't make sense, but from a distance, it looks like a grove of plum blossoms, making you feel as if you are standing amidst a sea of flowers, singing a song of "Standing tall with a thousand blooms, fragrance drifting to the clouds outside."

Tujia weaving emphasizes expression and creation, seeking the harmony of emotions rather than mere resemblance. Its colors are vibrant and strong, with clear contrasts, symmetrical lines, and a sense of beauty that brings joy to the heart.

Seeing the vibrant Tujia weaving, one naturally thinks of the weavers. In Longshan County, Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, there is a legend of a "beauty that breaks the heart":

Long ago, there was a beautiful, intelligent, and skilled Tujia girl named Xilan. She wove the colors of the sky and the patterns of the earth. She heard from the elders that there was a very beautiful white fruit flower on the back mountain, blooming at dawn and wilting by mid-morning. Xilan decided to weave the white fruit flower to present to the world. So, she went to the white fruit tree under the moonlight every night. On a night with a full moon, the white fruit tree bloomed beautifully. Xilan was overjoyed, but she never imagined that her jealous sister-in-law would tell her drunken brother that Xilan was doing shameful things at night. Her brother, in a fit of rage, killed her with an axe under the white fruit tree. The beautiful white flowers on the tree instantly wilted and fell. Later generations, to commemorate this girl who sacrificed her life for Tujia weaving, named it "Xilan Kapu."

With the image of Xilan in mind, we met Ye Yucui, a national master of arts and crafts, honorary president of the Hunan Artists Association, and an 81-year-old woman with a similar experience.

Ye Yucui was born into a poor Tujia family in Yejia Village, Miaoshi Township, Longshan County. At the age of nine, she learned weaving, and for over 70 years, despite life's hardships, she devoted herself to Tujia weaving. As a young woman, Ye Yucui once went to the mountains with her husband to chop firewood. She saw a tree full of vibrant and fragrant thorn flowers, with bees and butterflies fluttering around. She was enchanted, looking and smelling again and again, until her husband had chopped a full load of firewood. Only then did she wake from her reverie. Soon after, the "thorn flower" pattern was added to Tujia weaving.

During the Cultural Revolution, Tujia weaving was labeled as a "four olds" and was destroyed. Ye Yucui was ordered to leave her loom and undergo supervision and labor. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Ye Yucui, though already in her twilight years, enthusiastically took on batches of apprentices to pass on her skills.

As early as 1957, Ye Yucui collaborated with the craftsman Li Chang'e to create the Tujia weaving wall hanging "Developing the Mountains," which was exhibited at the London International Expo, bringing the unknown Tujia weaving to the nation and the world for the first time. She has woven over 120 traditional Tujia weaving pieces, some of which are preserved in the Ministry of Light Industry, Nanjing Weaving Center, and other units. Some have been exhibited in Japan, the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and other countries, bringing honor to the motherland.

In Jishou, we met two women completely different from Xilan and Yucui. One is Peng Zhongping, the 47-year-old deputy director of the Hua'yan County Nationality Arts and Crafts Factory (Tujia), and the other is Shi Ying, the 29-year-old director of the Jishou Nationality Arts and Crafts Factory (Miao). From their attire and demeanor, you can tell they are "modern" directors who have stepped out of the Tujia village. Indeed, besides weaving and designing Tujia weaving themselves, they have traveled to Beijing, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other major cities, aiming to sell the weaving to the five continents.

Now, in addition to traditional styles, Tujia weaving has added over 100 new styles, including wall hangings, woven bags, letter holders, travel bags, bedspreads, dresses, and neckties. Tujia weaving is shining with a unique luster.

### 土家织锦与土家“美神”

　　土家织锦与土家“美神”
    本报记者  尹品端
    今年二月，美国总统布什夫妇来华访问，李鹏总理夫妇送给他们两辆中国飞鸽牌自行车，还送了两个鲜为人知的湖南湘西土家族织锦香袋。在湖南龙山、吉首，湖北来凤等地居住的土家族人无不因此而神采飞扬。
    早春二月，我们在湘西见到了多彩的土家织锦，看到了被称为“土家美神”的叶玉翠老人。
    土家织锦，土家语叫“西兰卡普”。“西兰”是被面，“卡普”是花。连起来讲即“被面花”。西兰卡普是传统的土家族民间工艺品，全部编织工序都是手工操作。它有传统图案近二百种，据说这是举世无双的。
    土家织锦的图案主要有表现动物、常见的家庭用具、民族民间风俗、民族政治历史的，也有源于植物的，还有接受汉文化影响的……当地人说，飞禽走兽，小猫小狗，在织锦姑娘的巧手之下，皆栩栩如生；织锦上的花可留住蝴蝶，迷惑蜜蜂；反映土家人衣食住行的织锦，散发着土家人的糯米糍粑、油炸豆腐和苞谷烧酒的芬香，充满了人间烟火气息和亲切温馨之感。
    走进龙山民族织锦厂和吉首工艺美术研究所，一台台腰机、一个个织女，给人以古朴、纯真的感觉，一幅幅锦品给人以美的享受。
    一幅《迎亲锦》，把新娘、新郎、花轿、督官、送客、打旗帜的、举牌子的、打镏子的、吹唢呐的、骑马的、牵马的、抬嫁奁的……一一活脱脱地跃然锦上，浓缩了一幅土家人接亲的风俗长卷。
    一组一组反向交错平行、对称，由黑、白、赭等几种颜色组合的三角形是什么？那是《燕子花》。织锦图案上没有燕子，没有喙的头，没有羽翼，粗一看，什么也不像，仔细端详，不但觉得有燕子，而且仿佛听到了成双成对的燕子在喃喃絮语，看到了成排成行的燕子飞向高远的蓝天……
    同样，一幅由红、绿、紫、黄等菱形方块组成的《九朵梅》织锦，近看，不解其意，远望，则是梅林一片，让你如置身花团锦簇之中，高歌一曲“昂首怒放花万朵，香飘云天外”，才能尽情尽意。
    土家织锦重表现、重创造，追求情的合理而不只是形的酷肖，它的色调跳跃、强烈，对比鲜明，线条对称，让人在欣赏和使用它的同时，产生美的联感，唤发心灵的愉悦。
    看到绚丽多彩的土家织锦，自然要想到织锦人。在湘西土家族苗族自治州的龙山县，有个“美得叫人心痛”的传说：
    很久很久以前，有个美丽聪明、心灵手巧的土家族姑娘，名字叫西兰。她把天上的彩虹云霞，地上的兽禽百花都织遍了。她听老人说，后山有一种非常非常美丽的白果花，“寅时开，卯时谢”，人们很难见到它。西兰姑娘决心把白果花织出来献给人间。于是，她天天在夜深人静时，独自一人悄悄到后山白果树下去等候白果开花。在一个月亮又明又圆的夜晚，白果树果然开出了美丽的花朵。西兰姑娘欢喜若狂，如痴如醉……但她做梦也没想到，嫉妒的嫂嫂在醉酒的哥哥面前说西兰半夜三更到后山去做丑事，哥哥一斧把妹妹杀死在白果树下，满树洁白如玉的美丽花朵，一下子枯萎了、凋谢了。后人为了纪念这位为土家织锦献出了生命的姑娘，把土家织锦取名为“西兰卡普”。
    带着传说中西兰姑娘的形象，我们见到了与西兰姑娘有类似经历的、全国工艺美术大师、湖南美协名誉会长、八十一岁的叶玉翠老人。
    叶玉翠出生在龙山县苗市乡叶家寨一个贫苦土家人家里。九岁学织锦，七十多年来，不顾生活的坎坷，矢志不渝地把全身心倾注在土家织锦上。少妇时的叶玉翠，一次随丈夫上山砍柴，看见一树开得蓬蓬勃勃的刺花，色彩鲜艳，芳香袭人，蜜蜂、彩蝶在花边飞舞。她陶醉了，看了又看，闻了又闻，直到丈夫砍好满满一担柴来，她才如梦初醒。不久后，土家织锦中增添“刺花”品种。
    “文革”中，土家织锦作为“四旧”被扫荡，叶玉翠被勒令离开织机去接受监督劳动。党的十一届三中全会以后，叶玉翠已进入暮年，但她不顾自己年老体衰，热情地成批收徒传艺。
    早在一九五七年，叶玉翠与工艺美术家李昌鄂先生合作创作了《开发山区》土家织锦壁挂，被送到英国伦敦国际博览会上展出，把默默无闻的土家织锦第一次推向了全国、推向了世界。她织出的一百二十多种土家传统织锦作品，有的珍藏在轻工业部、南京织锦中心等单位，有的被介绍到日本、美国、加拿大、英国、菲律宾等国展出，为祖国争得了荣誉。
    在吉首，我们见到了与西兰、玉翠完全不同类型的两个女性。一个是四十七岁的花垣县民族工艺美术厂的彭种苹副厂长（土家族），一个是二十九岁的吉首民族工艺厂的石英厂长（苗族）。从她们的穿着打扮、言谈举止上，你一眼就可断定她们是走出了土家寨门的“洋”厂长。果然，她们除了自己编织、自己设计土家织锦之外，还踏遍了北京、南京、广州、西安等大中城市，要把织锦运销到五洲四海……
    如今，土家织锦除了传统的款式外，又增加了壁挂、织锦袋、信插、旅游包、床罩、衣裙、西服领带等上百种新款式，土家织锦，正在放射出奇光异彩。
