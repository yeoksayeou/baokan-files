Please Help Us Seek Justice

We three are farmers from a mountainous area. Last year on December 23, we shipped 15 packages of black wood ear mushrooms, totaling over 230 kilograms, from the Baoji Jianhe Railway Station in Shaanxi to Xining in Qinghai. This batch of black wood ear mushrooms was worth 8,673.50 yuan. When we went to Xining to pick up the goods, we found that seven packages had been reduced to half, and another five packages had been replaced with mountain wood ear mushrooms, resulting in a loss of over 4,000 yuan. We went to the Baoji Jianhe Railway Station, and they agreed to compensate for the missing amount but refused to address the issue of the replaced packages. Due to their delay in compensation, we had to sue at the Baoji Railway Transport Court, but because the time had exceeded three months, we did not receive any resolution.

Our money was all borrowed, and people are chasing us daily to repay it. What can we use to repay them? We hope that the Ministry of Railways will look into this matter, dispatch someone to investigate and resolve it. We would be extremely grateful.

　　请为我们做主
    我们三人是山区农民。去年十二月二十三日，我们从陕西宝鸡市建河火车站发运黑木耳十五包二百三十多公斤到青海西宁。这批黑木耳合人民币八千六百七十三点五元。当我们到西宁提货时，发现其中七包成了半包，另五包被换成山木耳，共损失四千多元。我们找到建河火车站，他们答应缺少的给赔偿，但被换掉的不管。由于他们迟迟不赔偿，我们只好起诉到宝鸡市铁路运输法庭，但因时间已超过三个月而得不到处理。
    我们的钱都是借贷来的，人家天天追着要钱，我们拿什么还呢？希望铁道部过问一下这件事，派人调查解决这件事，我们感激不尽。
