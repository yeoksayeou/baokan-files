Our unit has an airport in Jiaozhou City for flight training. In recent years, local farmers often enter the airport to graze their livestock. Sheep herds roam under the wings of the aircraft, and animal waste is scattered on the runway. During the rainy season, cattle and sheep bring mud into the runway, affecting the normal flight training of the unit. Despite repeated warnings from the security soldiers, the locals do not listen and continue to graze as before. The airport has turned into a pasture.

Can the relevant local authorities assist the unit in changing the current situation of the airport?

　　机场？牧场？
    我部队在胶州市有个飞行训练用的机场。近年来，驻地附近的农民经常进入机场放牧，羊群穿行于机翼之下，畜粪散落在跑道上。一到雨季，牛羊将泥土带入跑道，影响部队正常的飞行训练。尽管警卫战士屡屡劝阻，但群众不听，放牧如故。机场变成了牧场。
    地方有关部门能否协助部队改变机场现状？
