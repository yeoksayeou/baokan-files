Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev Says
	Bilateral Relations Are the Primary Agenda for Sino-Soviet High-Level Talks

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5 (Reporter Zhu Chengjun) Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev said on May 5 that the Soviet Union believes that the primary agenda for the upcoming high-level talks in Beijing will be bilateral relations.

	In response to questions from reporters at a press conference, he expressed that the two countries have not held high-level talks in nearly 30 years, accumulating many issues. Obviously, the normalization of relations between the two countries will be the most important topic of the talks. Since Gorbachev will meet with many Chinese leaders, including CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, it is expected that party-level contacts will be restored.

	He also pointed out that since both the Soviet Union and China are permanent members of the UN Security Council, this high-level meeting will also discuss some important global issues.

	In response to questions about the new type of relations between China and the Soviet Union, Rogachev believed that there are many common points between the Soviet Union's new political thinking and China's new international political order, and the goals proposed are also the same. Moreover, the Soviet Union pays attention to China's economic and political system reforms, and China is also concerned about the Soviet Union's reforms.

　　苏联副外长罗高寿说    
    双边关系是中苏高级会晤首要议题
    新华社莫斯科５月５日电  （记者竺承军）苏联副外长罗高寿５日说，苏联认为，即将在北京举行的中苏高级会晤首要议题是双边关系问题。
    他在记者招待会上答记者提问时表示，苏中两国近３０年没有举行高级会晤，积累了不少问题，显然，两国关系正常化将是会谈的最主要题目。由于戈尔巴乔夫将会见中国好些领导人，包括中共中央总书记赵紫阳，可望党的接触将得到恢复。
    他还指出，由于苏联和中国都是联合国安理会常任理事国，因此，这次高级会晤还将讨论一些全球性的重要问题。
    在回答有关中苏两国新型关系的问题时罗高寿认为，在苏联的政治新思维和中国的国际政治新秩序思想中有许多共同点，所提出的目标也是相同的。此外，苏联关注中国的经济和政治体制改革，同样中国也在关心苏联的改革。
