Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 15th.

The Israeli cabinet yesterday, after nearly 7 hours of intense debate, passed a plan for elections in the occupied Palestinian territories with a vote of 20 in favor and 6 against.

This plan consists of 20 clauses. The main points are: to hold "free elections" for Palestinians in the occupied territories; for the Israeli government to negotiate with the elected Palestinian representatives and begin implementing a 5-year period of Palestinian autonomy; to start negotiations on the "permanent solution" to the Palestinian issue no later than the third year of the autonomy transition period; to invite Egypt and Jordan to participate in the first stage of negotiations for the "temporary agreement" and the second stage for the "permanent solution"; to avoid violence, threats, and terrorist activities in the occupied territories during the 5-year election and negotiation transition period; and to allow all parties to present their claims in the second stage of negotiations, ultimately reaching a solution acceptable to all parties.

The plan states that "Israel opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state in the Gaza Strip and the region between Israel and Jordan"; "Israel does not negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization"; and "unless it aligns with the basic policies of the Israeli government," the status of the occupied territories will not change.

Local sources noted that this plan avoids sensitive issues such as whether the elections will have international supervision and whether Palestinian residents in East Jerusalem have the right to vote. The plan does not clearly specify whether Israeli troops will withdraw from the occupied territories before the elections begin.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 15th.

Abu Sharif, the press advisor to PLO Executive Committee Chairman Yasser Arafat, responded to Israel's "election plan" on May 14th in Tunis.

Sharif said that Palestinians "will not agree" to any elections that are not linked to the final political resolution of the Palestinian issue. Elections must lead to the end of Israeli occupation and the realization of Palestinian national self-determination.

Sharif pointed out that Israel's plan "deliberately leaves important details ambiguous." "If the final outcome of the plan is only Palestinian autonomy, the Palestinian people will firmly reject it."

According to a report from the Al-Ahram newspaper, Dennis Ross, a senior U.S. government official currently visiting the Middle East, urged the Israeli cabinet to pass this "election plan" and to influence the Israeli cabinet on issues such as the participation of East Jerusalem Palestinian residents in the elections and international supervision of the elections. Ross stated that this plan should be "part of the final solution to the Palestinian issue."

Another report stated that during a recent meeting between the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union and the United States, the Middle East issue was one of the important topics. The Soviet side felt "optimistic" about Israel's plan, believing it showed "some progress," but had not yet decided its final official stance.

　　以通过被占领土选举计划  巴解对有限自治表示异议
    本报开罗５月１５日电  记者林皎明报道：以色列内阁昨天经过近７小时的激烈争辩，以２０票赞成、６票反对的表决结果，通过一项关于在被占领土巴勒斯坦人举行选举的计划。
    这一计划包括２０项条款。主要内容是：在被占领土举行巴勒斯坦人“自由选举”；以色列政府与选出的巴勒斯坦人代表进行谈判，并开始实施为期５年的巴勒斯坦自治；至迟在自治过渡期的第３年，以色列政府与巴勒斯坦选出代表开始进行关于巴勒斯坦问题“永久解决”的谈判；邀请埃及、约旦两国参加“暂时协议”的第一阶段谈判和“永久解决”的第二阶段谈判；在为期５年的选举、谈判过渡期内，被占领土要“避免暴力、威胁和恐怖行动”；在第二阶段谈判中，各方“都有权提出主张”，最后达成各方都能接受的解决办法。
    计划写明，“以色列反对在加沙地带和以色列与约旦两国边境之间地区建立巴勒斯坦国”；“以色列不同巴勒斯坦解放组织举行谈判”；“除非符合以色列政府的基本政策”，被占领土的“地位”不发生变动。
    此间人士注意到，这份计划回避选举是否有国际监督、东耶路撒冷巴勒斯坦居民是否有权投票等敏感问题。方案没有明确规定以色列军队是否在选举开始前撤出被占领土。
    本报开罗５月１５日电　记者林皎明报道：巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特的新闻顾问阿布·谢里夫１４日在突尼斯对以色列“选举计划”作出反应。
    谢里夫说，巴勒斯坦人“不会同意”举行任何不与最终政治解决巴勒斯坦问题挂钩的选举。选举必须导致结束以色列占领、实现巴勒斯坦民族自决权。
    谢里夫指出，以色列的这一计划“故意在重要细节方面含糊不清”。“如果计划的最终结局只是巴勒斯坦自治，巴勒斯坦人民将断然拒绝。”
    据《金字塔报》消息透露，正在中东穿梭访问的美国政府高级官员丹尼斯·罗斯催促以色列内阁通过此份“选举计划”，并在东耶路撒冷巴勒斯坦居民参选、国际监督选举等问题上对以色列内阁施加影响。卢斯表示，这份计划应是“巴勒斯坦问题最终解决的一部分”。
    另据报道，在苏美两国外长不久前举行的会谈中，中东问题是重要议题之一。苏联方面对以色列这份计划“感到乐观”，认为它表示出“某种进展”，但尚未决定其最终正式立场。
