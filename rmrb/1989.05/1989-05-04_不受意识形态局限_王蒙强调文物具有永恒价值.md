    Unconstrained by Ideological Limitations
    Wang Meng Emphasizes the Eternal Value of Cultural Relics

    New China News Agency, Beijing, May 3 - (Reporter Li Guangru) Minister of Culture Wang Meng emphasized at the national cultural relics work conference held today that cultural relics possess absolute and eternal value, capable of transcending the limitations of time, space, and ideology. Without understanding this, it is impossible to correctly protect and leverage the advantages of cultural relics.

    China is a country rich in cultural relics, long admired by the world. Currently, there are 500 key cultural relics protection sites nationwide, 62 historical and cultural cities, and over 4,000 provincial-level key cultural relics protection sites. The Great Wall, the Forbidden City, the Mogao Caves, the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor, and the Peking Man Site have been listed as "World Cultural Heritage" by UNESCO.

    Cultural relics are the material remains of human natural and social activities. How to fully utilize their functions and roles? Wang Meng believes that the key lies in addressing the issue of recognition. He said that regardless of whether cultural relics are initially categorized as spiritual or material, advanced or backward, revolutionary or reactionary, they are all carriers of historical culture and should become objects of study, playing multiple roles. Evaluating the past decade of cultural relics work, Zhang Deqin, Director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, summarized it in eight characters: "Mixed blessings and woes, joys and sorrows intertwined." The successful restoration of numerous ancient buildings, fruitful archaeological excavations, and the rapid increase in the number of museums mark significant strides in China's cultural relics industry. However, the growing influence of the "money is everything" mentality has led to crimes such as grave robbery, theft of museum collections, and smuggling of cultural relics, prompting some cultural institutions to seek quick gains. They use exhibition halls for dances, set up canteens, and even rent out exhibition spaces for markets.

    In response to the challenges facing cultural relics work, Wang Meng reiterated in his speech: fundamentally, cultural relics are not commodities or "money trees." He reminded everyone that the current exploration of the negative aspects of Chinese culture has begun to extend to cultural relics. Some people say that the Great Wall is a tragic monument in history. Wang Meng believes that evaluations can differ and can continue to be debated, but the true face and value of the Great Wall are absolute. He also pointed out the need to properly handle the relationship between cultural relics protection and religious activities.

### 不受意识形态局限  王蒙强调文物具有永恒价值

　　不受意识形态局限    
    王蒙强调文物具有永恒价值
    新华社北京５月３日电  （记者李光茹）文化部部长王蒙在今天召开的全国文物工作会议上强调，文物具有绝对的、永恒的价值，可以超越时间、空间和意识形态的局限，不了解这一点，就不可能正确地保护和发挥文物的优势。
    中国是一个文物大国，历来为世人所倾倒。目前全国有重点文物保护单位５００处，历史文化名城６２座，省级重点文物保护单位４０００多处。长城、故宫、敦煌石窟、秦始皇陵、北京猿人遗址，被联合国教科文组织列为“世界文化遗产”。
    文物，是人类自然和社会活动的实物遗存，如何充分发挥其功能和作用，王蒙认为必须解决认识问题。他说，无论最初人们把文物分成是精神的还是物质的，先进的还是落后的，革命的还是反动的，它们都是历史文化的载体，都应成为研究对象，发挥多方面的作用。评价这１０年的文物工作，国家文物局局长张德勤概括为８个字：“利弊共存、喜忧交织”。大批古建筑修缮成功，考古发掘丰收，博物馆数量激增等，标志着我国文物事业迈出了新步伐。然而“金钱万能”思想的滋长，诱发了挖坟盗墓、盗窃馆藏及文物走私等犯罪活动，促使某些文博单位急功近利，利用展室办舞会，设食堂，甚至出租展厅办商场。
    针对文物工作面临的困难和冲击，王蒙在讲话中重申：从根本意义上说，文物不是商品，也不是“摇钱树”。他提醒大家注意，目前对中国文化消极面的探讨已开始延伸到文物方面。有人说长城在历史上是一座悲剧纪念碑，王蒙认为，评价尽可以不同，也尽可以争议下去，但长城的本来面貌与价值却是绝对的。他还指出，要处理好文物保护与宗教活动之间的关系。
