State Chairman Yang Shangkun held a grand banquet in the Great Hall of the People this evening to warmly welcome the President of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Sayyid Ali Khamenei, who is on an official friendly visit to China.

Chairman Yang Shangkun spoke first at the banquet, highly praising the friendly relations that already exist between China and Iran. He commended Iran's independent foreign policy since the establishment of the Islamic Republic, which does not align with any major power bloc.

Chairman Yang said, "At present, Iran and Iraq are negotiating under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General to implement Security Council Resolution 598. We sincerely hope that both countries will adopt a more flexible attitude, engage in mutual concessions and friendly consultations, fully implement this resolution, and promptly, comprehensively, fairly, and reasonably resolve all disputes between them, achieving lasting peace and good-neighborly friendly relations."

When discussing the international situation, Chairman Yang said, "To promote the continued development of international relations in a direction of easing tensions, the Chinese government advocates establishing a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Countries with different social systems, ideologies, and levels of development should coexist in friendship, and all international disputes should be resolved through peaceful negotiations rather than resorting to force or threatening with force. Chairman Yang pointed out that with the easing of the international situation, countries are paying more attention to development issues. Economic and technological exchanges between countries are becoming increasingly close. While actively promoting South-South cooperation, the Chinese government supports promoting South-North cooperation through dialogue, advocates establishing a new international economic order based on equality and mutual benefit, and benefits the common prosperity of all countries."

President Khamenei, in his speech, first expressed his heartfelt thanks to the Chinese leadership and people for their warm welcome and sincere hospitality.

President Khamenei said, "Iran sincerely hopes for world stability and security, as well as peace, joy, and happiness for all the people of the world. Therefore, Iran has accepted UN Resolution 598, taking a significant step towards establishing lasting peace and security in this region of the world. We believe that all foreign troops must withdraw from the Persian Gulf. We believe that the way to restore full security in the Persian Gulf is through sincere cooperation among the countries of the region. We welcome this cooperation."

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Seypidin Azizi, State Councilor Li Guixian, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the banquet.

This morning, State Chairman Yang Shangkun hosted a ceremony at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People to warmly welcome President Khamenei and his delegation.

In another development, Premier Li Peng met with Iranian President Khamenei this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

Premier Li Peng warmly welcomed President Khamenei's visit, saying, "I am very pleased that President Khamenei has traveled a long distance to visit China. I hope that through this visit by the President, relations between China and Iran will be developed and strengthened."

During the meeting, both sides frankly exchanged views on developing friendly cooperative relations between China and Iran and other issues of common interest.
