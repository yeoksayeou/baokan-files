Since March, the exploration and development work of the gas field in our province within the jurisdiction of Kai Jiang County has been repeatedly obstructed. On March 8, farmers from seven villages in Yong Xing Township set up roadblocks with stones and bricks on the public road, preventing the 6031 drilling team from moving. On March 12, four vehicles from the mud station were stopped by a township head leading a crowd when passing through Qi Long Township. They demanded 54,000 yuan for road maintenance and a 60,000 yuan interest-free loan before allowing the vehicles to proceed. On March 15, the operation team was intercepted by a group of farmers from Qi Long Township while en route, with 22 vehicles and 60 operators stranded. The condition for release was that, in addition to fulfilling the compensation contract, an additional 60 tons of fertilizer had to be provided.

By the time we wrote this letter, more than 40 vehicles involved in the relocation of drilling rigs and gas well operations had been intercepted by villagers from Yong Xing and Qi Long Townships. The intercepting villagers also physically assaulted officials and workers who went to reason with them, resulting in five injuries. Additionally, the villagers destroyed three diesel engines, stole one water pump, causing a loss of over 30,000 yuan.

The Sha Guan Ping gas field located within the jurisdiction of Kai Jiang County is a key development area in eastern Sichuan. The relevant departments plan to achieve a production capacity of 200 million cubic meters of natural gas this year to alleviate the shortage of gas for chemical fertilizer production in Sichuan. Due to the unreasonable demands of some townships and villages in Kai Jiang County not being met, the township leaders have caused obstacles in the land expropriation issue, even organizing villagers to block roads and intercept people, leading to work stoppages and production halts. This will make it impossible to implement the gas field development plan.

We hope that the relevant departments in Kai Jiang County will take action to address this issue.

### 四川气田勘探开发工作受阻

　　四川气田勘探开发工作受阻
    ３月以来，我省气田勘探开发工作在开江县境内频频受阻。３月８日，永兴乡七村农民用条石、砖块在公路上设置路障，不许６０３１钻井队转移。３月１２日，泥浆站４辆车路过骑龙乡时，一名乡长率众扣住车辆，声言不拿出５．４万元养路费用和６万元无息贷款就别想将车开走。３月１５日，作业队在行进途中，遭到骑龙乡一群农民无理阻截，２２辆车和６０名操作人员被困。放行的条件是，在履行赔产合同以外，还得额外追加６０吨化肥。
    到我们写这封信时，担负钻机搬迁和气井作业的各型车辆，先后已有４０多辆被永兴、骑龙两乡村民拦截，拦车的村民并对前去讲理的干部、工人大打出手，致使５人受伤。另外，村民们还毁坏３台柴油机、盗走１台打水泵，损失３万多元。
    位于开江县境内的沙罐坪气田是川东重点开发区。有关部门拟在今年达到开采２亿立方米天然气的生产能力，以缓解四川化肥生产用气不足的问题。由于开江县一些乡村提出的无理要求未能满足，乡村领导人便在土地征用问题上作梗，甚至公然组织村民拦车截人，导致停工停产，这将使气田的开发方案无法实施。
    希望开江县有关部门出面管管这件事。
