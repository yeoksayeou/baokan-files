    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa (Reporter Āncuo) The "Four Tantras Series of Illustrated Complete Works" in Tibetan and Chinese, and Tibetan and English, co-compiled by the Tibet Autonomous Region Tibetan Medical Hospital and the Ministry of Health's Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, recently passed a scientific and technological appraisal in Lhasa and will be published and distributed.

    The classic work of Tibetan medicine, the "Four Tantras" (Tibetan pronunciation: "Jushi"), was written by the "Medical Saint" of the Tubo Kingdom, Yuthog Yonten Gonpo, and completed in the 8th century. The standardized "Four Tantras" is divided into four parts: the "General Tantra," the "Explanatory Tantra," the "Instructions Tantra," and the "Supplementary Tantra." The entire book takes the form of a dialogue between the Medicine Buddha and his five manifestations, covering the entire field of Tibetan medicine and pharmacology. The existing complete set of "Four Tantras Series of Illustrated Complete Works" includes seventy-nine main illustrations, with an additional portrait of famous doctors through the ages, making it the eighty-first illustration.

    The "Four Tantras Series of Illustrated Complete Works" systematically introduces medical and health science theories and practical techniques in the form of continuous color illustrations. It is not only unique in the history of Chinese medicine and pharmacology but also rare in the history of world medicine and pharmacology. It is a product of the combination of medical content and artistic expression.
