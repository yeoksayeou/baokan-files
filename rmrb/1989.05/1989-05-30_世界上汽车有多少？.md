Since the first car was invented in the last century, the number of cars in the world has increased rapidly. Today, the automobile industry has become one of the three pillars of the global economy. According to statistics from 170 countries and regions compiled by the British Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, by 1986, the world had over 500 million cars. On average, there is one car for every 10 people globally. However, the distribution is highly uneven, with developed countries owning significantly more cars than developing countries. Approximately 80% of the world's cars are concentrated in Europe and North America.

The country with the most cars is the United States, which currently has 170 million vehicles. On average, there are two cars for every three people, and almost every family owns 1-2 cars, with some families even having one car per person. The roads in the United States are filled with endless streams of cars, truly living up to the title of the "Kingdom of Cars." Outside of the United States, Japan has the most cars, with around 50 million vehicles, averaging two people per car. West Germany has over 30 million cars, also averaging two people per car.

Currently, the global annual car production has surpassed 40 million units. In 1988, it reached approximately 46.5 million vehicles, an increase of about 1.1% from the previous year. Japan has the highest production, reaching over 12.7 million vehicles, a 3.7% increase from the previous year. This includes 8.29 million passenger cars, 57,000 luxury cars, and 4.44 million trucks. Domestic sales were around 6.5 million vehicles, and exports were about 6.1 million vehicles. The United States produced approximately 11 million cars in the previous year. Since 1984, the United States has been surpassed by Japan and now ranks second. West Germany produced 4.34 million vehicles, a slight decrease from the previous year, ranking third. France produced 3.2 million vehicles, a 4.9% increase from the previous year, ranking fourth. Additionally, countries like the Soviet Union, Italy, Belgium, Canada, and the United Kingdom produced over 1 million vehicles each, while South Korea and Brazil were close to 1 million vehicles.

China's annual car production was less than 10,000 vehicles in 1957, 40,000 vehicles in 1965, 150,000 vehicles in 1978, 222,000 vehicles in 1980, 472,000 vehicles in 1987, and 646,700 vehicles in 1988. This is more than four times the production of 1978, making China one of the world's major car-producing countries.

While having more cars is beneficial, it also brings problems such as traffic accidents. Statistics show that since the invention of cars, 25 million people have died in car accidents worldwide, with approximately 500,000 deaths and over 10 million injuries each year. The direct economic loss is around $400-500 million. In the United States, there are about 20 million traffic accidents each year, resulting in over 50,000 deaths and more than 1 million injuries. The country with the highest traffic accident rate is South Korea, known as the "Country of Traffic Accidents." The country with the lowest traffic accident rate is Sweden, with only a few hundred deaths each year, known as the "Country of Traffic Safety."

    世界上汽车有多少？
    自上个世纪第一辆汽车问世以来，世界上的汽车增加得很快。到现在，汽车工业已成为世界上三大经济支柱之一。据英国汽车制造与销售协会根据170个国家和地区的统计，1986年，全球已拥有5亿多辆汽车，按全世界人口平均，每10人一辆。但是不同的地区和国家占有很不平衡，发达国家占有量比发展中国家明显高得多，大约80％的汽车集中在欧洲和北美。
    世界上拥有汽车最多的国家是美国，目前拥有1.7亿辆，平均每3个人有2辆，每个家庭几乎都有1—2辆，有的甚至一人一辆。美国所有公路上都是连绵不断的汽车长龙，确实不愧为“汽车王国”。除美国之外，拥有汽车最多的是日本，大约5000多万辆，全国平均2人一辆。联邦德国拥有3000多万辆，也是平均2人一辆。
    目前全世界汽车年总产量已突破4000万大关，1988年达到4650万辆左右，比上一年增长大约1.1％。产量最多的是日本，达到1270多万辆，比上年增长3.7％。其中小轿车829万辆，大轿车5.7万辆，卡车444万辆；国内销量约650万辆，国外销售约610万辆。美国去年生产汽车约1100万辆。自1984年以来，美国已被后来居上的日本超过，居第二位。联邦德国产434万辆，比上年略有减产，居第三位。法国产320万辆，比上年增长4.9％，居第四位。此外，苏联、意大利、比利时、加拿大、英国等国都超过100万辆，南朝鲜、巴西接近百万辆。
    我国汽车年产量，1957年不足万辆，1965年4万辆，1978年15万辆，1980年22.2万辆，1987年47.2万辆，1988年64.67万辆，相当1978年的4倍多，已跃居世界生产大国之列。
    汽车多了是好事，但也带来了烦恼的车祸。据统计，自有汽车以来，全球死于汽车车祸的有2500万人，每年大约死亡50万人，伤1000多万人，直接经济损失四五亿美元。美国每年发生大小车祸2000万次，死亡5万余人，伤百万余人。世界上交通事故率最高的是南朝鲜，被称为“交通事故之国”；交通事故率最少的是瑞典，每年死亡仅几百人，被称为“交通安全之国”。（余洋）
