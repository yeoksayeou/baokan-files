Henan Rapeseed Achieves Large-Scale Bumper Harvest

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 28 (Reporter Zhang Yulin) This year, Henan's 3.96 million acres of rapeseed have achieved a bumper harvest, with an estimated total production of 400 million kilograms.

Last year, due to frost damage, rapeseed in this province suffered large-scale reductions or complete failures, which dampened farmers' enthusiasm for planting. As a result, the planting area this year has decreased. However, in concentrated production areas such as Nanyang, Xinyang, and Zhumadian, due to relatively abundant rainfall and lighter disasters, coupled with careful management, the growth has been good throughout. From the actual harvesting situation, the yield per acre is over 100 kilograms.
