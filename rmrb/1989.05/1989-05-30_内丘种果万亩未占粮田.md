    Inner County Plants 10,000 Mu of Fruit Trees Without Occupying Arable Land

    Our reporter learned that Hebei Province's Neiqu County has guided farmers to plant fruit trees on barren mountains, beaches, and slopes. This year, the entire county planted 10,000 mu of fruit trees without occupying a single mu of arable land.

    The county committee and county government have formulated regulations that fruit orchards must not encroach on arable land. They have also used preferential policies to actively guide farmers to develop barren mountains, beaches, and slopes, promoting the growth of orchards.
