    Relying on policy, science, and hard work to become wealthy, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Hulunbuir League's New Barag Left Banner, Galabul Sumu's Galabul Village, has seen its elderly herdsman, Sili Te'erdi, sell 1,535 head of livestock to the state over six years. At 56 years old, Sili Te'erdi began contracting and managing livestock in 1983. Over the years, through meticulous care and scientific management, his livestock business has developed rapidly. Now, he has 2,100 head of large and small livestock, becoming a major livestock owner in Hulunbuir League. The image shows Sili Te'erdi's flock of sheep.  Photographed by Tóng Jǐngwén.
