Khomeini's successor, Montazeri, announced his resignation in March. The question of who will take over the leadership is both urgent and crucial.

By September 24 this year, Khomeini will be 87 years old. His health is also not good. The issue of succession must be resolved as soon as possible. In Iran's unique political system, the leader's position is supreme, and his opinions are not subject to discussion or defiance. Therefore, who will occupy this seat is a matter of great significance.

According to Iran's current constitution, the leader must be a Muslim guide or model, and must also possess political acumen. The vast majority of Iranian Muslims choose a highly respected grand ayatollah as their model. For grand ayatollahs, the more followers they have, the higher their status in the religious community and the greater their influence. Currently, the highest-ranking grand ayatollahs in Iran, apart from Khomeini, number six. Montazeri has just stepped down, and the other five are either elderly and infirm or have no intention of entering politics, making them unlikely candidates for future leadership.

To address this issue, Khomeini agreed to amend the constitution and established a 25-member committee to discuss the amendments. Of these, 20 were appointed by Khomeini, and the other 5 are members of parliament elected by the assembly. Among the 25 members, 22 are clerics. Khomeini set the scope for amending the constitution. The first item is the clause regarding the leader, requiring them to submit a plan by the end of June and to put it to a public vote in July along with the presidential election.

For nearly 20 days, this group has been meeting daily, and the attention of various political factions and forces has been focused on this issue. Since the issue is not yet clear, other activities, policies, guidelines, and plans cannot be determined.

The debate is intense. Opinions can be roughly divided into three categories: The first opinion is to lower the religious requirements for the leader, not necessarily a Muslim guide, but a general cleric would suffice, or although not a de facto guide, possessing the qualifications of a guide would be acceptable. If this opinion is adopted, it may mean that the theocratic system will be somewhat weakened. As for the candidates, three names are being discussed in society: Speaker Rafsanjani, current President Khamenei, and former Prime Minister Karubi. These three individuals are all members of the moderate or pragmatic faction. The second opinion is collective leadership, establishing a committee of 3 to 5 people, as stipulated in the current constitution, but few people hold this view. The third opinion is to completely abolish the position of the leader.

Recently, Iran's _Jomhuri Eslami_ newspaper also raised a new question: what if the so-called Council of Experts, composed of clerics, finds a candidate suitable for future leadership but later discovers that they are not qualified, as in the case of Montazeri? Montazeri's problem arose while Khomeini was still alive, and it was resolved according to Khomeini's decision. The essence of this discussion is whether the leader should be subject to some form of constraint.

It is predicted that all these issues will become clear in July and August. It can be anticipated that there will definitely be some changes, but they will all be within the scope of clerical rule.

### 霍梅尼年高体衰谁来接班

　　霍梅尼年高体衰谁来接班
    新华社记者  许博渊
    霍梅尼的接班人蒙塔泽里３月份宣布辞职。谁来接领袖的班，这个问题既紧迫又事关重大。
    到今年９月２４日，霍梅尼就８７岁了。身体也并不健康。接班人问题必须尽快解决。在伊朗独特的政治体制中，领袖的地位是至高无上的，他的任何意见，都具有不容讨论、不可违抗的性质。因此，谁来坐这把交椅，自然非同小可。
    根据伊朗现行宪法，领袖必须是穆斯林的导师或者叫楷模，同时要具备政治才干。绝大多数伊朗穆斯林都选择一位德高望重的大毛拉作自己的楷模。对于大毛拉来说，弟子越多，在宗教界的地位就越高，发言权也就越大。目前，伊朗宗教级别最高的大阿亚图拉，除霍梅尼之外，还有６人，蒙塔泽里刚刚下台，其他５人，或者年迈体衰，或者无意从政，都不可能成为未来的领袖。
    为了解决这个问题，霍梅尼同意修改宪法，并成立了一个２５人的班子讨论修改宪法。其中２０人是霍梅尼任命的，另５人是议会选出的议员。２５人中，２２人是毛拉。霍梅尼规定了修改宪法的范围。第一条就是关于领袖的条款，要求他们在６月底以前拿出方案，在７月份和总统选举一起，交付公民投票通过。
    近２０天来，这个小组天天开会，各种政治派别和势力的注意力都集中到这个问题上来了，由于这个问题尚不明确，其它一切活动、政策、方针、计划都不可能确定。
    争论是激烈的。意见大致有３种：第一种，降低领袖的宗教条件，不必是穆斯林导师，一般毛拉即可，或者虽然不是事实上的导师，但具备导师的资格就可以。如果这种意见得到采纳，可能意味着政教合一的体制在一定程度上将有所削弱。至于人选，社会上议论到的有３人，一个是议长拉夫桑贾尼，一个是现任总统哈梅内伊，还有一个是曾当过总理的卡尼，这３个人都是温和派或务实派的成员。第二种意见是集体领导，成立３至５人的委员会，像现行宪法所规定的那样，但持这种观点的人为数不多。第三种意见是根本取消领袖这一级。
    最近，伊朗《消息报》还提出了一个新的问题，由毛拉组成的所谓专家委员会在选择未来领袖的时候认为是合格的，但后来发现不合格，如同蒙塔泽里那样，该怎么办？蒙塔泽里的问题是在霍梅尼在世的时候发生的，根据霍梅尼的决定就解决了。这种议论的实质是，领袖是否应当受到某种制约。
    人们预测，所有这些，将在７、８月份初见分晓。现在可以预料，变化肯定会有一些，但都是在毛拉专政的范围内变通。
