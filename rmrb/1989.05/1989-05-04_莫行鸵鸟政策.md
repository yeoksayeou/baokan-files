Title: Do Not Practice the Ostrich Policy

Last month, the Chairman of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, Delagassa, claimed at a joint meeting of the Mexican and U.S. Congresses that "the United States does not have trade protectionism," rejecting Mexico's request for trade liberalization.

This prominent U.S. congressman actually publicly denied a well-known objective fact, which is truly surprising. People have not forgotten that on August 23 last year, President Reagan formally signed the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act, which has a strong flavor of trade protectionism. This act requires the president to impose retaliatory measures on foreign "unfair trade," to increase anti-dumping and countervailing duties, to take punitive actions against countries that violate U.S. intellectual property rights, and to increase subsidies for agricultural exports, among other things. This act has caused strong dissatisfaction among Japan, Western Europe, and other major Western countries. This act also prevents developing countries from enjoying the non-reciprocal trade benefits they deserve, making them victims of U.S. trade protectionism. This is the fact, how can one say that U.S. trade protectionism "does not exist"?

As for the Latin American countries neighboring the United States, they are also deeply affected by U.S. trade protectionism. Under the pressure of strong protectionist demands from the U.S. Congress, the U.S. government has adopted strict import restriction measures, making it difficult for some important products from Latin American countries, such as textiles, steel, ethanol, sugar, and fresh flowers, to enter the U.S. market, causing losses to Latin American countries.

Currently, one of the demands of developing countries to improve the international economic environment is to ask developed countries to reduce trade protectionism and open their markets to developing countries. As a U.S. congressman, it would be better to do something beneficial to reduce trade protectionism, rather than practicing the ostrich policy of ignoring facts.

### 莫行鸵鸟政策

　　莫行鸵鸟政策
    上月底，美国众议院农业委员会主席德拉加萨在墨美议会联席会议上声称，“美国不存在贸易保护主义”，拒绝了墨西哥关于贸易开放的要求。
    这位堂堂的美国众议员居然当众否认人所共知的客观事实，委实令人惊讶。人们并没有忘记，去年８月２３日里根总统正式签署了带有浓厚贸易保护主义色彩的综合贸易法案。这项法案要求总统对外国所谓“不公平贸易”施加报复，增设反倾销税和反补贴税，对违反美国知识产权的国家采取制裁行动，增加农产品出口补贴，等等。这项法案引起了日本、西欧主要西方国家的强烈不满。这项法案还使发展中国家不能享受应有的非互惠贸易利益，成为美国贸易保护主义的牺牲品。这就是事实，怎么能说美国贸易保护主义“不存在”呢！
    再从与美国为邻的拉美国家来说，它们也深受美国贸易保护主义之苦。美国政府在国会强烈的保护主义主张的压力下，采取严格的限制进口的措施，使拉美国家一些重要产品，如纺织品、钢材、乙醇、糖和鲜花等很难进入美国市场，给拉美国家带来损失。
    当前，发展中国家要求改善国际经济环境的内容之一，就是要求发达国家减少贸易保护主义，向发展中国家开放市场。身为美国议员，还是为减少贸易保护主义做一点有益的事为好，莫行无视事实的鸵鸟政策。
