In the thirty-plus years since India gained independence in 1947, the Indian market for small cars has been largely dominated by two foreign brands: "Ambassador" and "Premier." Today, the roads of India are increasingly filled with the small, agile "Fengshen" brand cars, produced through a joint venture between India and Japan.

"Fengshen" is the Chinese translation of the Hindi word "Maruti," which is the avatar of the monkey king Hanuman in the famous epic "Ramayana." It moves swiftly, like a gust of wind. In October 1982, the Maruti Udyog Limited of India and Suzuki Motor Corporation of Japan signed a memorandum of understanding to jointly produce cars. In December 1983, the first "Fengshen" car rolled off the assembly line. Due to its small size, convenience, and practicality, the production and sales of "Fengshen" cars have developed rapidly. According to statistics, in 1987, the total sales of cars and jeeps in India were 150,000 units, of which Maruti alone sold 90,000 units, accounting for 60% of the market. In 1988, Maruti's sales volume exceeded 100,000 units.

India is an oil-importing country, so fuel efficiency is the primary goal of "Fengshen." Currently, the fuel consumption of "Fengshen" cars is 4.5 liters per 100 kilometers.

Since the production of "Fengshen" cars, while ensuring quality, both parties have made arduous efforts to achieve technology transfer and local production of automobile parts. The main approach of Maruti and Suzuki is to jointly invest in funds and technology to help and support the development of parts production enterprises, promoting their technological upgrades and ensuring standardized production quality. Currently, 70% of "Fengshen" car parts are supplied by external cooperative enterprises. In the fourth year of "Fengshen" production, except for the carburetor, transmission, and gearshift, 85% of the parts production has been localized.

Under the influence of "Fengshen," the Indian automobile industry has seen a trend of introducing foreign technology and joint ventures with foreign companies. Now, the "Ambassador" brand has four new models with imported foreign technology, and the "Premier" brand has three. In the past decade, the total sales of cars in India have increased sixfold. Maruti Udyog Limited is not satisfied with the achievements it has made. It plans to launch a mid-sized car in the second half of next year. At the same time, Maruti has formulated a plan to promote exports, aiming to enter the international market and increase foreign exchange earnings.

　　“风神”与印度汽车工业
    赵小树
    在一九四七年独立后的三十多年间，印度的小轿车市场基本上被“大使”和“总理”两个牌子的外国汽车所垄断。今天，在印度马路上跑的更多的则是印度与日本合资生产的小巧玲珑的“风神”牌小轿车。
    “风神”是印地文“马鲁蒂”的意译，是著名的《罗摩衍那》史诗中猴王哈努曼的化身。它行动迅速，犹如疾风。一九八二年十月，印度马鲁蒂汽车公司与日本铃木公司签订合资生产的谅解备忘录，一九八三年十二月第一辆“风神”牌小轿车正式出厂。由于“风神”小型轻便、经济实用，生产和销售都发展迅速。据统计，一九八七年全印轿车和吉普车的总销售量为十五万辆，仅马鲁蒂一家就销售了九万辆，占市场的百分之六十。一九八八年，马鲁蒂公司销售量突破十万辆大关。
    印度是石油进口国，因此，节油是“风神”的第一目标。目前，“风神”牌汽车耗油量为百公里四点五升。
    “风神”汽车投产后，在保证质量的前提下，为实现技术转让和汽车零部件的当地生产，“风神”轿车的合作双方作了艰苦的努力。马鲁蒂公司和铃木公司的主要办法是通过共同投资从资金和技术两方面来帮助和扶持零部件生产企业，促进它们技术上的更新换代和保证质量的标准化生产。目前，“风神”汽车零部件的百分之七十是由公司外的协作企业提供的。“风神”投产后的第四年，除汽化器、变速箱和排挡外，百分之八十五的零部件生产已实现当地化。
    在“风神”的带动下，印度汽车工业出现了引进外国技术和与国外合资生产的潮流。现在，“大使”牌有四种引进外国技术的新车型，“总理”牌有三种。全印的汽车销量最近十年来增加了六倍。马鲁蒂汽车公司并没有满足已取得的成绩，它准备于明年下半年推出中型小轿车。同时，马鲁蒂公司还制定了促进出口的计划，以打入国际市场，增加外汇收入。
