In a weightlifting competition featuring 10 world-class athletes, Chinese athlete He Zhuoqiang secured the first place.

The event, held on May 4th at the Yoyogi Second Gymnasium in Tokyo, deviated from the usual format. The 10 athletes competed together regardless of their weight classes. Their rankings were determined by the percentage of their total lifts relative to the world record for their respective weight classes. The higher the percentage, the better the ranking.
