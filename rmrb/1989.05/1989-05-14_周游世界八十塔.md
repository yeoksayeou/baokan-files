Last night, on the 100th birthday of the Eiffel Tower, Paris Television Channel 2 invited television stations and artists from more than ten countries to perform a song and dance show, introducing the magnificent views of 80 famous towers around the world, creating a grand and spectacular scene.

As night fell, the "Iron Lady" Eiffel Tower, adorned with golden lights and incandescent bulbs forming the characters "100 years," stood out against the night sky of Paris, illuminated by countless lights. The stage of the Palais de Chaillot in front of the tower was brightly lit, with melodious songs filling the air. The sculptures and countless fountains with white water jets, along with the colorful fireworks, all reflected around the tower, making it even more charming and graceful. People watched on their small screens the diverse appearances of 80 famous towers around the world. The Leaning Tower of Pisa, built in the 12th century, the 553-meter-high CN Tower in Toronto, the square ancient tower of Morocco, the renowned Tower of London, the colorful church towers of Moscow, as well as the temples and pagodas of China and Japan, all brought fresh and novel sights. Singers from Italy, West Germany, Japan, and other countries performed on or in front of their respective country's towers, singing and dancing joyfully. The Soviet Union's duo ballet and the Jackson Five's live rock 'n' roll performance were warmly received by the audience.

When the host and the French singer Michèle who had visited China greeted Beijing Television with "你好" (nǐ hǎo) in Chinese, the screen showed the majestic Great Wall and various ancient Chinese towers. The broadcaster introduced that China has thousands of ancient towers. For Westerners, they might consider the ancient beacon towers on the Great Wall as the "elders" of modern towers. At the foot of the beacon tower, a Chinese child actor who had won a world gold award performed a thrilling act, balancing tower-shaped cups on his hands, feet, mouth, and forehead while lying on his stomach, leaving the audience breathless with admiration.

To highlight the friendly relationship between the Eiffel Tower and its sister towers, the host invited some performers to bid farewell to the audience in multiple languages at the end of the show. When Michèle, who was about to visit China again, greeted China with "你好" in Chinese, we in Paris also felt very warm. At that moment, countless searchlights crisscrossed and flashed around the tower, and colorful fireworks bloomed in the dark night sky. The show ended with joyful music.

　　“周游世界八十塔”
    本报记者  张启华
    昨晚，在埃菲尔铁塔百岁寿诞的日子里，巴黎电视二台邀请世界十多个国家的电视台、艺术家联演歌舞节目，介绍世界８０座名塔盛景，气势磅礴、蔚为壮观。
    入夜，用金色灯光和白炽灯组成“百年”大字的“铁娘子”——埃菲尔铁塔突出于巴黎万家灯火的夜空之中。铁塔前的夏乐宫舞台灯火辉煌、歌声悠扬。广场上的雕塑、无数喷泉的白色水柱、五彩缤纷的礼花，映衬于铁塔周围，使她变得更加娇艳妩媚。人们从小小的荧屏上看到了世界８０座名塔的千姿百态。建于公元１２世纪的比萨斜塔、高达５５３米的多伦多电视塔、摩洛哥方形古塔、闻名于世的伦敦塔、莫斯科教堂彩塔、以及中国、日本的庙堂寺塔，令人耳目一新。意大利、西德、日本等国的歌星，在自己国家的塔上、塔前载歌载舞，放声歌唱。苏联人表演的双人芭蕾舞、美国杰克逊三兄弟的现场摇滚乐演唱受到了观众热烈欢迎。
    当节目主持人和曾访问过中国的法国女歌唱家米海依用中文“你好”与北京电视台呼唤联系时，荧屏上出现了巍峨的万里长城和一座座中国古塔。广播员介绍说，中国有数千座古塔。对于西方人来说，他们可能把古老的万里长城上的烽火台看成现代塔的“老前辈”。在烽火台脚下，一位得过世界金奖的中国小演员，用腹着地，手、脚、口、额各托顶着一撂撂塔型酒杯，这一紧张、惊险的表演，令人赞不绝口。
    为了体现埃菲尔铁塔和她的姊妹塔们的友好情谊，晚会结束时，节目主持者特意让部分演员用多种语言向观众谢幕。当即将再次访华的米海依又一次用准确的中文“你好”向中国致意时，身在巴黎的我们也感到十分亲切。此时无数只探照灯在铁塔周围交织闪射，五颜六色的礼花在冥冥夜空中竞放，晚会在欢快的音乐声中结束。
