Nearly 100,000 private motor vehicles are congesting the streets of the capital, Beijing. The city's roads, already operating at full capacity, are experiencing frequent accidents. Currently, various types of private vehicles are increasing at an average rate of over 920 vehicles per month.

As of the end of February this year, Beijing's private cars, including large buses, large trucks, small trucks, small sedans, small travel cars, and jeeps, have reached 14,789 vehicles. Including motorcycles and other motorized vehicles, the total number of private motor vehicles in the city is 90,147. In 1988, the city had 430,000 motor vehicles, a permanent and floating population of 11,310,000, and 7,300,000 bicycles. The planned road density in the urban area is only 1.1 kilometers per square kilometer, and the per capita road area is only 4.5 square meters. The enormous size of the city and the limited road density and per capita road area can hardly accommodate the continued large-scale purchase of various private motor vehicles.

Relevant authorities have called for attention: If private motor vehicles are allowed to continue to develop unchecked, the traffic congestion in the city will be difficult to alleviate, pedestrian safety will be even more at risk, and the development of public transportation will also be affected.

According to a survey by the Beijing Evening News, those who buy private cars are mostly individual transportation operators, well-known figures from the arts and sports sectors, individuals with wealthy relatives abroad, newly wealthy individual business owners, and those with limited funds but hoping to make big money by buying cars. Currently, there are few restrictions on purchasing and using private cars. It is said that some people simultaneously own two small sedans.

　　月增九百辆　总数近十万    
    北京私人机动车失控
    本报讯  近１０万辆私人机动车辆拥挤在首都北京的大街小巷。超负荷运行的市区道路，事故屡有发生。而从目前的情况看，各类私车仍在以平均每月９２０余辆的惊人数字增加。
    截至今年２月底止，北京市包括大客、大货、小货、小卧车、小旅行车和吉普车在内的私人汽车便达１４７８９辆，加上摩托车和手拖等机动车等，全市私人机动车总数则为９０１４７辆。１９８８年全市有４３万辆机动车，常住和流动人口共１１３１万人，自行车７３０万辆，而规划市区道路密度每平方公里仅有１．１公里，人均道路面积只有４．５平方米。城市规模之巨与规划道路密度、人均道路面积之小已很难容纳各种私人机动车的继续大量购进。
    有关人士呼吁：倘听任私人机动车继续无控制地发展，市区交通紧张状况将无法缓解，行人安全将更无保障，公共交通的发展也将受影响。
    据《北京晚报》的一项调查，购私车的多为个体运输经营者、文艺、体育界等各界知名人士、海外有富裕亲戚者、发迹的个体户以及手头资金不多、期望买车捞大钱的“凑钱户”。目前，购私车用私车限制极少，据说有人手头竟同时拥有两台小卧车。
