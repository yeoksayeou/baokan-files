In recent years, the supply and demand imbalance of color televisions in China has been very prominent, with chaotic sales channels and severe speculation. To address this, the State Council decided to implement a monopoly sales policy for color TVs starting from February 1, 1989. This measure has protected the interests of the state and consumers. However, it has also brought about some new problems.

First, the capital occupied by enterprises has increased. For example, last year, the Baoding Hardware Store in Hebei sold 12,000 units of various color TVs, with an average purchase price of 2,000 yuan per unit, totaling 24 million yuan in occupied capital. After the implementation of the monopoly sales policy, the average purchase price per color TV increased to 2,500 yuan. If the sales volume remains the same as last year, it will increase the occupied capital by 6 million yuan.

Second, the sales units have incurred operational losses, affecting their enthusiasm for business. Last year, the Baoding Hardware Store made a profit of 34.60 yuan per color TV sold. After the implementation of the monopoly sales policy, although the average purchase price increased to 2,500 yuan (including an average factory price of 1,700 yuan, a special consumption tax, and a fund for the development of domestic production totaling 800 yuan), the sales units can only calculate the gross profit based on the average factory price, while the costs have to be paid based on the average purchase price, relatively increasing the operating costs. Therefore, now each color TV sold results in a loss of 9.39 yuan. As a result, this store did not sell a single color TV in the first quarter of this year.

Third, after the implementation of the monopoly sales policy, each color TV is subject to an additional special consumption tax and a fund for the development of domestic production based on the factory price. These funds are paid by the sales units when purchasing the color TVs, while consumers pay when buying the color TVs. During this time gap, the funds are actually advanced by bank loans, violating the state's financial policies.

If the above three problems are not resolved in a timely manner, it may lead to a decline in the production and sales of color TVs.

### 彩电专营后出现的新问题

　　彩电专营后出现的新问题
    近年来，彩色电视机在国内的供需矛盾十分突出，经营渠道混乱，倒买倒卖严重。为此，国务院从今年２月１日起决定对彩电实行专营。这个措施，维护了国家和消费者的利益。但也随之出现了一些新问题。
    一、企业资金占用增大。例如，去年河北保定五金站经销各种彩电１．２万台，每台平均进价２０００元，共占用资金２４００万元。实行彩电专营后，每台彩电的平均进价提到２５００元，若仍按去年经销数计算，将增加资金占用６００万元。
    二、经销单位出现经营性亏损，影响经营的积极性。去年保定五金站经销１台彩电的利润是３４．６０元，实行彩电专营后，虽然每台平均进价提至２５００元（其中平均出厂价１７００元，特别消费税和国产化发展基金８００元），但经销单位只能在平均出厂价的基础上计算毛利，而费用则要在平均进价上支付，相对加大了经营成本。因此，现在每经销１台彩电，要亏损９．３９元。所以这个站今年第一季度没有经销１台彩电。
    三、彩电专营后，每台彩电在出厂价基础上，加收特别消费税和国产化发展基金，这些款经销单位在购进彩电时先交了，而消费者在购买彩电时才交。在这个时间差里，实际是由银行贷款垫付，违反了国家金融政策。
    以上三个问题如不及时解决，有可能造成彩电生产和销售的滑坡。
