The communication facilities on the Han River, including the maritime telephone lines and navigation lights, are crucial for ensuring the safety of vessels. However, recently, the maritime telephone lines and navigation lights along the Han River from Hankou to Xiangfan in our province have been repeatedly damaged by lawbreakers, resulting in significant losses.

The communication lines along the Zhongxiang section of the Han River have been stolen five times, with 4,000 meters of copper-aluminum wire stolen by lawbreakers. The Shaoyang section has been stolen ten times, with 3,500 meters of copper-aluminum wire ending up in a scrap yard. The navigation lights on the Han River have also been repeatedly stolen. Recently, a fleet of ships passing through the Duobao area of Tianmen City lost their way due to the theft of navigation lights, leading to an accident. Because the telephone lines were also damaged, the fleet was unable to call for help and had to watch helplessly as ships and cargo worth tens of millions of yuan sank into the river.

Currently, the flood season on the Han River is approaching, and if this trend of "stealing wires and extinguishing lights" is not stopped in time, the consequences will be dire.

　　汉水河道上航标通讯设施屡遭破坏
    航运电话专线和航标灯，是保证船只安全的重要设施。然而在近期，我省汉口至襄樊汉水沿线电话专线和河道的航标灯，屡遭不法分子的破坏，造成了重大损失。
    汉水沿线的钟祥段通讯线路已连续５次被盗，４０００米的铜铝线被不法分子窃走；沙洋线段连续１０次被盗，３５００米铜铝线早进了废品站。汉水河道的航标灯也屡遭盗窃。前不久，一船队行至天门市多宝一带，由于航标灯被盗，迷失航向，造成了事故。又因电话线路被人破坏，船队无法呼救，眼睁睁看着价值数十万元的船与货沉入了江底。
    目前，汉水汛期即将来临，而河道的这股“盗线灭灯风”如不及时制止，后果将不堪设想。
