Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, May 16th.

The "1989 World Population Situation Report" released by the United Nations Population Fund today states that the world's population has reached 5.2 billion this year. By the end of the century, it will increase to 6.25 billion, and by 2025, it will reach 8.5 billion. In 100 years, it will double to 10 billion.

The report states that from now until the end of the century, the world's population will increase by more than 90 million people each year, of which 94% will be in developing countries.

The report suggests that to lower the birth rate, countries should vigorously promote family planning. By the end of the century, 58% of women worldwide should participate in family planning, and by 2025, this should reach 71%, which is the current level in industrialized countries.

The report warns that if family planning is not effectively implemented and the above targets are not met, by the 22nd century, the world's population could swell to 14 billion.

The report calls on governments to pay attention to women's health, education, and equal rights to participate in social and economic life, and proposes several goals to be achieved globally by the end of the century.

　　联合国人口基金预报    
    本世纪末世界人口达６２．５亿
    本报联合国５月１６日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国人口活动基金今天发表的“１９８９年世界人口情况报告”指出，今年世界人口达５２亿，到本世纪末将增加到６２．５亿，到２０２５年将达８５亿，１００年后将倍增到１００亿。
    报告说，从现在到本世纪末，世界人口每年增加９０００多万人，其中９４％属于发展中国家。
    报告提出，为了降低人口出生率，各国应大力推行计划生育。到本世纪末，全世界参加计划生育的妇女需达５８％，到２０２５年需达７１％，即目前工业化国家的水平。
    报告警告说，如果计划生育执行不力，达不到上述指标，到２１世纪末，世界人口可能膨胀到１４０亿人口。
    报告要求各国政府关心妇女的健康、教育以及参加社会和经济生活的平等权利，并提出到本世纪末全球应达到的几项目标。
