Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, May 12th.

"One small step, but a good one." This was the evaluation made by U.S. Secretary of State Baker on May 11th, en route from Moscow to Brussels, regarding the Soviet Union's latest proposal to unilaterally reduce short-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

Baker reported to the North Atlantic Council this morning on the results of his talks with Soviet leaders in Moscow.

Today, the news media here quickly reported on Gorbachev's latest proposal, noting that its release at this time could have a dual effect. Not only does it "attractively demonstrate the Soviet Union's goodwill," but it also adds fuel to the fire in the internal crisis within NATO. Currently, NATO member countries are in a heated debate over whether to negotiate with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles and when to do so. The new proposal will make those advocating for NATO to engage in short-range missile talks with the Warsaw Pact more resolute in their stance.

　　贝克评戈尔巴乔夫建议
  　一小步，却是好的一步
    本报布鲁塞尔５月１２日电  记者魏崴报道：“一小步，但却是好的一步。”这是美国国务卿贝克１１日晚由莫斯科飞往布鲁塞尔途中，对苏联单方面削减欧洲短程核武器的最新建议作出的评价。
    贝克于今天上午，向北约理事会通报了他在莫斯科与苏联领导人会谈的情况。
    今天这里的新闻媒介，对戈尔巴乔夫的这一最新建议迅速予以报道，认为它此时出台，可收一箭双雕之效，不但“引人注目地表明苏联的善良愿望”，同时在北约内部危机上，火上添油。眼下，北约诸成员国正在为在短导上该不该与苏联谈判，何时谈判问题吵得不可开交。新建议将会使主张北约应和华约举行短导谈判者，态度更加坚决。
