In 1988, Soviet research institutions began implementing the economic accounting system, taking new measures to promote the integration of science and technology with production, and exploring new ways to accelerate the application of scientific and technological achievements. Currently, the reform of the Soviet scientific and technological system is advancing with firm steps.

Implementation of the Economic Accounting System in Research Institutions

The central task of the Soviet scientific and technological community in 1988 was to implement the decision of the June Plenum of the CPSU Central Committee, transitioning research institutions to a full economic accounting system. Over the past year, more than 1,500 research units in 23 ministries have adopted the new system. The research units of the Academy of Sciences and universities have not yet implemented the new system, but the method of allocating funds has changed from allocating operational funds to institutions to allocating funds based on projects, while also allowing for the undertaking of some "contract research projects."

The State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR completed an important task in 1988: determining the strategic development of Soviet science and technology for the next 20 years and drafting the "Comprehensive Outline for the Technological Progress of the USSR." In addition, it developed some supporting measures for the implementation of the new system by research institutions, such as drafting regulations for technology transfer contracts, methods for the allocation of wage funds for research units of the Academy of Sciences and universities, and methods for the allocation of funds for research and development work.

Practice over the past year has shown that the new system is beneficial for integrating scientific research with the national economy and promoting enterprises' concern for technological progress. However, due to the basic unchanged organizational structure of the scientific and technological system and the continued use of "state orders" by various departments, it is not possible to establish a competitive system, which hinders the formation of a technological innovation mechanism. Nevertheless, with the implementation of the new system, the issue of determining the price of scientific and technological achievements has become a central topic in the scientific and technological community. The transformation of departmental research institutions has sparked strong reactions from some scientists in the Academy of Sciences system, who propose that science should also take the path of "true economic accounting" and implement a contract system.

Currently, the State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR is considering a more daring strategy: introducing the lease-contract system into the scientific and technological management system, and some even advocate using the new economic means of "taxation-leasing" to manage science and technology.

Measures to Integrate Science and Technology with Production

Encouraging the development of private research institutions. In the process of exploring the commodification of scientific and technological achievements, a prominent development trend is the rise and rapid development of private scientific and technological companies such as the "Soviet Youth Science and Technology Creation Center." According to incomplete statistics, 35 "centers" were established in Moscow in 1988, with a total of more than 270 nationwide, employing over 30,000 people, and the total contract amount has exceeded 300 million rubles. These "centers" are established by young scientific and technological personnel, do not require state investment, operate independently, and are self-sufficient. They are involved in both development and organizing scientists, engineers, and technicians in society to complete research projects on a contractual basis. The "centers" have received support from the State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR since their inception, and a special "All-Union Coordination Committee for Youth Science and Technology Creation" has been established. In 1988, coordination committees were established in various republics, states, cities, and districts, and the activities of hundreds of "centers" nationwide have formed a unified system known as the "Youth Science and Technology Creation Center Network." The Chairman of the State Committee for Science and Technology, Tolstykh, believes that the "centers" are organically integrated into economic reform, filling the gaps between various departments, and are beneficial for more comprehensively meeting the needs of the national economy for science and technology. General Secretary Gorbachev of the CPSU encourages the Youth Science and Technology Creation Center to "go on the international stage."

Establishment of national cross-departmental technological development companies. In 1988, the Soviet Union established several high-level cross-departmental technological companies, such as the "Power Machinery," "Engineering Chemistry," and "Electrical Instruments" companies. All enterprises participating in the above companies are detached from their subordinate ministries and supervising departments. The purpose of the companies is to develop new technologies and processes as quickly as possible and promote their application in the national economy.

Establishment of a science and technology bank. In 1988, the first financial organization aimed at accelerating the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into productive forces, the "Innovation Joint-Stock Bank," was established in Leningrad. It has 14 enterprises, research institutions, social organizations, and universities as shareholders. Recently, the Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the USSR also became a shareholder. The bank's main direction for near-term loans is the development of building materials, household appliances, and consumer goods production. Subsequently, similar banks were established in Moscow, Kiev, Kuibyshev, and other cities, providing financial guarantees for the promotion and application of scientific and technological achievements.

This year, the reform of the scientific and technological funding system will be fully implemented, with all departmental research institutions fully implementing the new system of economic accounting and self-raised funds. The State Committee for Science and Technology of the USSR will strengthen its coordinating role in the selection of priority directions for technological progress, further improve the economic management system for technological progress, and promote the transition of research institutions to a fully economic accounting income allocation model (i.e., basic wages and bonuses fluctuate with the enterprise's income situation).

　　苏联科技体制改革的新进展
    黄寿增
    １９８８年苏联科研机构开始实施经济核算制，采取了促进科技与生产相结合的新措施，在加速科技成果的应用方面也进行了新的探索。目前，苏联的科研体制改革正以坚定的步伐前进。
    科研机构实施经济核算制度
    １９８８年苏联科技界的中心任务是落实苏共中央六月全会的有关决议，实施科研机构向完全的经济核算过渡。一年来已有２３个部的１５００多个科研单位实行新制度。科学院和高校科研单位尚未实行新制度，但拨款方法已由以往给单位拨事业费，改为根据课题拨款，同时允许承担部分“合同科研项目”。
    苏联国家科委１９８８年完成了一项重要任务：确定了今后２０年苏联科技发展战略，编制了《苏联科技进步综合纲要》，除此之外，为科研单位实施新制度研究制定了一些配套措施，如制定了科技产品转让合同条例、科学院和高校科研单位工资基金构成办法、科研和研制开发工作拨款方法等。
    一年来的实践表明，新制度有利于科研工作同国民经济相结合，促进了企业关心科技进步。但由于科技系统组织结构基本未动，加上各部门依然通过“国家订货”，因而无法建立竞争体制，阻碍着技术创新机制的形成。尽管如此，随着新制度的实施，如何确定科技成果的价格问题正日益成为科技界的中心议题。部门科研单位的转向引起科学院系统的一部分科学家的强烈反响，他们提出科学也要走“真正经济核算”的道路，实行承包制。
    目前，苏联国家科委正在考虑更大胆的战略：将租赁承包制引入科技管理体制，甚至有人主张采用“纳税—租赁”的新经济手段管理科技。
    科技与生产相结合的措施
    鼓励发展民办科研机构。在探索科技成果商品化的过程中，一个比较突出的发展趋势是：苏联“青年科技创造中心”等民办科技公司开始兴起，发展迅速。据不完全统计，１９８８年，莫斯科已成立３５家“中心”，全国已达２７０多家，工作人员超过３万，合同总额已突破３亿卢布。这些“中心”由青年科技人员创办，不需国家投资，独立核算，自负盈亏，既从事开发，又组织社会上科学家、工程技术人员在合同基础上完成科研课题。“中心”一出现就得到苏联国家科委的支持，专门成立了“全苏青年科技创造协调委员会”。１９８８年，在各加盟共和国、州、市、区都相继成立了地方协调委员会，全国数百家“中心”的活动已形成一个统一系统，称作“青年科技创造中心网”。国家科委主席托尔斯特赫认为，“中心有机地长入经济改革，填补了各部门结合部的空白，有利于更全面满足国民经济对科技的需求”。苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫鼓励青年科技创造中心“走向国际舞台”。
    组建国家跨部门科技开发公司。１９８８年苏联成立了一些高层次的跨部门科技公司，如“动力机械”、“工程化学”、“电器仪表”公司。凡参加上述公司的企业都与其隶属的部和主管部门脱钩。公司的宗旨是以最快的速度开发新工艺、新技术并在国民经济中推广应用。
    成立科技银行。１９８８年在列宁格勒成立了一家旨在加速科技成果转化为生产力的金融组织——“创新股份银行”，这是苏联历史上第一家科技银行。有１４家企业、科研单位、社会团体、高校入股。不久前，苏联对外经济银行也参股。银行近期贷款的主要方向是发展建材、家用电器、消费品生产。此后，在莫斯科、基辅、古比雪夫等城市也先后成立了这类银行，为科技成果的推广应用提供资金保证。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    今年，科技拨款制度改革将全面铺开，各部门科研单位全部实施完全的经济核算、自筹资金新制度。苏联国家科委将加强科技进步优先方向选择中的协调作用，进一步完善科技进步的经济管理体制，促进科研单位向完全的经济核算的收入定额分配模式（即基本工资和奖金一样，随企业的收入情况浮动）过渡。
