Afghan Civil War Flares Up Again; Talks Between Two Rebel Factions Fail

After nearly 10 days of relative calm on the battlefield of Jalalabad, Afghan rebel forces launched attacks from four directions on the city. The rebels also decided to concentrate their forces to attack the western city of Kandahar.

According to reports, the rebels have once again cut off the road between Jalalabad and Kabul and deployed their newly formed armored units to attack the city. This unit, consisting of 25 tanks and dozens of armored personnel carriers, is led by Muhammad Khan and is tasked with the main assault on the city. Other rebel forces also launched attacks from four directions on Jalalabad.

Meanwhile, the government forces in Kabul have launched several counterattacks, engaging in close combat with the rebels, but failed to break out, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. In recent days, the Kabul government forces have fired more than 40 "Scud" missiles at rebel positions, causing unknown damage.

It is also reported that the military consultation meeting of the rebel forces has made a decision to concentrate forces to attack the western city of Kandahar in the coming days. The military consultation meeting of the seven-party alliance will supervise this joint military operation, and the rebels will first concentrate their forces to attack Kandahar Airport. It is said that the rebel positions are only 1 kilometer away from the airport. Currently, civilians can still freely enter and exit Kandahar, but the rebels have issued a notice that once the war starts, civilians will be prohibited from entering the city. In addition, the rebels also decided to launch an attack on Herat.

Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, May 29th.

The seven-party alliance and the eight-party alliance of Afghan rebel forces held talks in Pakistan from May 19th to 27th. The two sides did not reach an agreement on the allocation of seats in the interim government of Afghanistan. However, both sides agreed to establish a six-person committee to determine the date for the next round of talks.

The four-person delegation of the eight-party alliance, based in Iran, was led by its leader A. Khalili, while the delegation of the seven-party alliance, based in Pakistan, was led by Burhanuddin Rabbani.

According to informed sources, the eight-party alliance demanded 25% of the 28 seats in the interim government, while the seven-party alliance refused.

    游击队两派会谈未果
    本报伊斯兰堡５月２９日电  记者任毓骏报道：综合当地报纸及外电今天消息，在贾拉拉巴德战场相对平静近１０天之后，阿富汗游击队从４个方面重新对贾城发起进攻，游击队还决定集中兵力攻打西部城市坎大哈。
    据报道，游击队已再次切断贾拉拉巴德通往喀布尔的公路，并出动自己新组建的装甲部队向贾城进攻。这支部队由２５辆坦克和数１０辆装甲运兵车组成，由穆罕默德·汗率领，担任这场围城战的主攻任务。其他游击队也从４个方面向贾城发起进攻。
    与此同时，喀布尔政权守军也发起数次反攻，和游击队短兵相接，但未实现突围，双方伤亡情况都很严重。连日来，喀布尔政府军已向游击队工事发射了４０多枚“飞毛腿”导弹，造成的破坏不明。
    另据报道，游击队方面的军事协商会议已作出决定，近日将集中兵力进攻西部城市坎大哈，七党联盟军事协商会议将监督这次联合军事行动，游击队将首先集中兵力攻打坎大哈机场。据称，游击队的工事距机场仅１公里。目前，平民仍可自由出入坎大哈，游击队已发出通知，战争一打响，将禁止平民进入这座城市。此外，游击队还决定对赫尔曼德也发起进攻。
    新华社伊斯兰堡５月２９日电  阿富汗游击队７党联盟和８党联盟于５月１９日至２７日在巴基斯坦举行了会谈。双方在阿富汗临时政府的席位分配问题上未取得一致。但是，双方决定成立一个６人委员会来确定下轮会谈的日期。
