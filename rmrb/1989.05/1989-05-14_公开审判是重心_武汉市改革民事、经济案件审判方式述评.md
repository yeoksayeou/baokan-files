For many years, courts across the country have been plagued by the accumulation of civil and economic cases. To address this issue, starting from last June, the Wuhan Intermediate People's Court decided to conduct a trial reform pilot in Jianghan District, Dongxihu District, and Wuchang County courts, focusing on the principle of public trials. Some initial experiences have been gained.

According to China's Civil Procedure Law, the principle of "whoever asserts, must prove" applies in civil litigation, meaning that whoever brings a civil lawsuit must bear the burden of proof. However, in the past, district and county courts in Wuhan, after accepting civil and economic cases, would spend a great deal of manpower and resources on investigation and evidence collection. From a complaint to a case file, all investigative and evidentiary work was undertaken by the courts, leading to an abnormal situation where "the court investigates, the lawyer reviews the case file, the plaintiff talks, and the judicial staff runs around." Statistics show that civil cases accepted by district and county courts in Wuhan used to take an average of about three months to conclude. Since judicial personnel focused only on pre-trial investigations, court hearings often became mere formalities, going through the motions.

To change this situation, the three pilot units, including the Jianghan District Court in Wuhan, made public trials and court investigations the main venues for collecting and verifying evidence. The presiding judge would inquire about each relevant fact of the case one by one during the court investigation. After asking one question to one party, they would immediately ask the other party. The parties or their legal representatives would present evidence supporting their claims as the questioning proceeded, immediately cross-examining and verifying. After clarifying one issue, they would move on to the next. Generally, under the scrutiny of the public and mutual cross-examination, it is quite difficult for the parties to lie or be deceitful. Through a serious and thorough court investigation, most of the evidence proving the case can be collected. What remains for the court to investigate and collect are only those pieces of evidence that the parties are not convenient to provide, as well as the verification of contradictions in the evidence presented by both parties. This not only significantly reduces the workload but also allows for a more accurate determination of the facts of the case, improving the quality of case handling. Currently, the average time to conclude civil cases in Jianghan District has been shortened from the original 97.3 days to 39.7 days; economic dispute cases have been shortened from the previous 53.7 days to 31.4 days.

In the past, there was a prevalent view among judicial personnel in Wuhan that civil trial work was essentially doing public relations, and the process of trying civil cases was the process of doing public relations. As a result, too much emphasis was placed on mediation before the trial. Even when the parties were unwilling to mediate, they were forced to do so. If the first mediation failed, a second attempt would be made, affecting the efficiency of case handling. In the reform, the three pilot units, including the Jianghan District Court in Wuhan, integrated mediation into the court proceedings, scheduling the first mediation after the court debate. The court fully respects the opinions of the parties. If the parties are unwilling to mediate, they are not coerced.

The pilot units in Wuhan, including the Jianghan District Court, have realized through the trial reform process that by seriously implementing the public trial system, using court investigations, cross-examinations, and debates to present the truth of the facts, the different aspects of the contradictions, and the rights and wrongs of both parties to the participants in the lawsuit and the audience, and explaining the reasons for applying which law during the trial, the transparency of case handling is increased. This not only prevents individual judicial personnel from making preconceived judgments or being biased, but also blocks loopholes for individual judicial personnel to act corruptly, promoting the clean governance of the people's courts.

It can be seen that the reform of trial methods by the pilot units, including the Jianghan District Court in Wuhan, has indeed grasped the focus of court reform. By the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the Supreme People's Court introduced their experiences to the court system across the country in various ways. If all levels of people's courts across the country can reform their trial methods like the pilot units, including the Jianghan District Court in Wuhan, and implement public trials, not only can the long-standing accumulation of civil and economic cases be changed, but it will also help to foster a "clean and upright" atmosphere.

　　公开审判是重心   
    ——武汉市改革民事、经济案件审判方式述评
    本报记者  王礼明
    多年来，全国不少法院长期为积压民事案件和经济案件所苦恼。为了解决这个问题，从去年６月开始，武汉市中级人民法院决定在江汉区、东西湖区、武昌县法院等单位，进行以贯彻公开审判原则为中心环节的改革审判方式试点，并初步取得了一些经验。
    按照我国民事诉讼法的规定，民事诉讼谁主张谁举证，即谁提出民事诉讼要求，谁负举证责任。但是，过去武汉市区县法院在受理民事和经济案件后，却要花大量人力、经费去调查取证。从一张起诉状到一本案卷，一切调查取证工作都由法院承担，出现“法院调查，律师阅卷，当事人动嘴，法院干部跑腿”的不正常现象。据统计，武汉市区、县法院受理的民事案件，过去平均要用三个月左右时间才能结案。由于审判人员只重视开庭前调查，所以，只有审判人员认为调查清楚了，证据取全了，才开庭审理。这时候，开庭往往变成摆样子，走过场。
    为了改变这种状况，武汉市江汉区法院等三个试点单位，把公开审理、法庭调查作为收集、核实证据的主要场所。法庭调查由审判长就与案件有关的事实情节，一项一项地询问调查，问完一方当事人一个问题，随即询问对方当事人。双方当事人或其诉讼代理人用来证明自己主张的有关证据，也随着询问及时出示，当即质疑对证。调查清楚一个问题，再询问调查下一个问题。一般来说，在众目睽睽、互相质证的情况下，当事人要说谎耍赖是比较困难的。通过严肃认真的法庭调查，大部分能够证明案件的证据都可以收集到。剩下来需要法院调查收集的，就只是那些当事人不便提供的证据，以及调查核实双方当事人举证的矛盾。这样不仅大大减轻了工作量，而且可以比较准确地查明案件事实，提高办案质量。目前江汉区民事案件平均结案时间，已由原来的９７．３天缩短为３９．７天；经济纠纷案件由过去的５３．７天缩短为３１．４天。
    过去，在武汉市审判人员中流行一种看法，认为民事审判工作就是做群众工作，审判民事案件的过程就是做群众工作的过程，因而过分强调开庭前的调解。当事人不愿调解的也硬要调解，一次调解不成，再搞第二次，影响了办案效率。武汉市江汉区法院等三个试点单位在改革中，把调解贯穿于庭审之中，第一次调解安排在法庭辩论结束后进行。法庭充分尊重当事人的意见。当事人不愿调解的，不强人所难。
    武汉市江汉区法院等单位从改革审判方式试点过程中体会到，认真实行公开审判制度，通过法庭调查、质证和辩论，把事实的真相、矛盾的不同侧面、双方当事人的是非责任，都展现在诉讼参与人和旁听群众面前，把适用哪一条法律的理由，也当庭向诉讼参与人和旁听群众介绍，增加办案透明度，既可以防止个别审判人员先定框框、先入为主的错误，也可以堵塞个别审判人员徇私枉法的漏洞，推进了人民法院的廉政建设。
    可以看出，武汉市江汉区法院等试点单位改革审判方式的做法，确实抓住了法院改革的重心。去年底和今年初，最高人民法院以不同方式向全国法院系统介绍过它们的经验。如果全国各级人民法院都能像武汉市江汉区法院等试点单位那样，认真改革审判方式，实行公开审判，不仅长期积压民事案件和经济案件的状况可以改变，而且也有助于“清正廉明”风气的形成。
