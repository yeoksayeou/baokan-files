	“White House Scholars”

	Q: According to reports, the recently appointed U.S. Deputy Secretary of Transportation, Chinese-American woman Zhao Xiaolan, entered the political arena through the “White House Scholars” program. Could you please introduce the background of the “White House Scholars” program?

	A: In October 1964, U.S. President Johnson announced at the White House the establishment of the “White House Scholars” program to cultivate young talents in national management. The purpose of this program is to provide young Americans who have achieved success, have talent, and have a high degree of ambition with direct experience and knowledge in managing the state and leading society. This allows them to have the opportunity to participate directly in government work, expand their horizons, enrich their experience, and enhance their leadership abilities and sense of responsibility. Implementing this program also helps to improve the composition and style of government officials. When these “White House Scholars” return to their original positions, they can promote understanding and communication between the government and other sectors.

	The selection of “White House Scholars” is strict and competitive. According to the regulations, including federal government employees, any U.S. citizen between the ages of 23 and 36 with a certain amount of work experience and a university degree can apply. The main criteria for evaluation include the applicant's performance in school and at their workplace, leadership abilities, and dedication to their career. The “White House Scholars” program lasts for one year, and the selection period is from February to May each year. Initially, 33 candidates are selected and recommended by 11 regional selection committees across the country, followed by interviews and reviews by the “White House Scholars Program Presidential Commission.” Ultimately, 13 to 20 scholars are selected from several thousand applicants. The selected “White House Scholars” take a one-year leave from their original units, during which their salaries are paid by the federal government.

	“White House Scholars” generally work as assistants in various government departments and the offices of the President and Vice President. In addition to handling daily work, they attend two high-level seminars per week to stay informed about domestic and international situations and government policies. After the one-year period, the vast majority of “White House Scholars” return to their original positions, while only a few remain in the federal government to continue working for a period.

　　“白宫学者”
    问：据报载，最近出任美国交通部副部长的美籍华裔女士赵小兰，是经由“白宫学者”而步入政坛的，请介绍一下“白宫学者”的由来。
    答：一九六四年十月，美国总统约翰逊在白宫宣布，为培养管理国家方面的青年人才，设立一项“白宫学者计划”。该计划的目的是向白宫以外的那些有成就、有天才、有高度进取心的美国青年，提供管理国家领导社会的直接经验和知识，让他们有机会直接参加政府工作，以扩大视野，丰富阅历，增强他们的领导能力和责任感。实施这一计划也有助于改善政府官员的成份与作风，当这些“白宫学者”回到原工作岗位后，又可以促进与政府间的理解及沟通。
    “白宫学者”的选拔严格、竞争激烈。按规定，包括联邦政府雇员在内，凡是有一定工作经历、有大学文凭的二十三岁至三十六岁美国公民都可申请。考察内容主要有：申请人在学校及工作岗位的成绩，领导才能，对事业的献身精神等。“白宫学者”每期一年，每年的选拔时间为二月至五月。先由全国十一个地区选拔委员会初选、推荐三十三名候选人，再由“白宫学者计划总统委员会”面试和复查，最终从几千名申请人中产生十三至二十名。入选的“白宫学者”向原单位请假一年，在此期间，工资改由联邦政府发给。
    “白宫学者”一般在政府各部及总统和副总统办公室做助手工作，除直接处理日常工作外，每周要参加两次高级报告会，及时了解国内外形势和政府政策。一年期满后，绝大多数“白宫学者”回原单位，只有少数人留在联邦政府继续工作一段时间。    （文云）
