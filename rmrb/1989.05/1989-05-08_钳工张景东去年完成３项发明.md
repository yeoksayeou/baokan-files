Worker Zhang Jingdong of the Benxi Steel Company's Continuous Rolling Mill completed three inventions last year. Among them, the car anti-theft fuel tank has been granted a national invention patent, and the sight with protective cover and suction cutting torch have been accepted by the National Patent Office.

Zhang Jingdong is an ordinary fitter. He designed and invented the car anti-theft fuel tank. No matter what size of rubber hose is used, oil cannot be siphoned from the fuel filler neck or the fuel gauge sensor and other oil outlet valve parts. Tools such as wrenches, pipe wrenches, and screwdrivers cannot remove the fuel gauge sensor and oil outlet valve or the drain plug to release the oil. No matter how the vehicle is tilted, oil cannot flow out from the fuel filler neck.
