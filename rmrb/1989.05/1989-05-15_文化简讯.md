Recently, a regular printing worker, Yu Chengsong, successfully experimented with "counterprinting." He created paintings on a glass plate using oil paints, watercolors, ink, gouache, acrylic, soot, oil paint, and dyes. After covering the plate with xuan paper and applying various techniques, images emerged on the paper that are neither traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, gouache paintings, nor ordinary woodblock prints. These "counterprints" depict worlds rich in atmosphere and emotion.

A newly excavated and restored work, "The Diagram of the Mysteries of Cultivating the Mind and Body on Mount Wudang," has been discovered at the Daoist holy site of Mount Wudang. This diagram is a sister piece to "The Complete Diagram of Cultivating the Mind and Body on Mount Wudang." It holds significant importance for the systematization, theorization, and scientific study of Wudang and Chinese internal martial arts. The diagram is composed of characters, illustrations, and lines, with dynamic lines and refined cutting techniques. Although it has some damaged areas, it has been restored to its original state by experts.

    △普通印刷工人于成松最近试验“对印版画”获成功。他在一块玻璃板上，用油彩、水彩、墨汁、水粉、丙烯、墨烟、油漆、染料等“涂凑”成一幅幅图画，覆盖上宣纸并施以各种技法，于是，宣纸上出现了一种非国画、非油画、亦非水粉画、又非一般木刻版画的“对印版画”，表现了一个个有境有情的世界。
