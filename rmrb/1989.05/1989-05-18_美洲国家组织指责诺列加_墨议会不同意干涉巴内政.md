The Organization of American States' foreign ministers' meeting tonight passed a draft resolution, accusing General Noriega of bearing responsibility for the crisis in Panama.

According to a report from Mexico City Television, the 32 member countries of the Organization of American States held a meeting in Washington today to discuss the situation in Panama. White House spokesman Fitzwater called for the Organization of American States to collectively condemn Noriega. The foreign ministers' meeting engaged in heated debate and had a brief recess. In the evening, after resuming the meeting, a draft resolution was passed with 20 votes in favor, accusing General Noriega of bearing responsibility for the problems that arose during the May 7th elections. It was also decided to send the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago, and Guatemala to Panama to mediate, and to submit a report on resolving the Panama crisis by June 5th.

In Mexico City, the Mexican Congress today debated the situation in Panama and passed a resolution opposing interference in Panama's internal affairs. The resolution stated that the Organization of American States should not become the final arbiter of Panama's elections. The resolution also considered the Mexican Foreign Ministry's May 14th statement on the situation in Panama, which accused General Noriega, to be an act of interference in Panama's internal affairs.
