	In Memory of Our Commander: General Xiao Jingguang

	People's Liberation Army Navy

	Comrade Xiao Jingguang was a loyal Communist who had been tested by the Party, an outstanding revolutionary and military leader of the proletariat, an excellent leader of the state and the military, a distinguished military commander of our army, and a beloved commander of the People's Liberation Army Navy. He dedicated his entire life to the construction of the Navy over the course of 30 years. The history of the People's Navy, from small to large and from weak to strong, is closely tied to the name of Xiao Jingguang. His passing is a significant loss for our Party and our military. The entire Navy mourns this highly respected commander with profound sorrow and remembers with deep affection the outstanding contributions he made to the construction of the People's Navy.

	Valuable Spirit of Hard Work and Pioneering

	In October 1949, just half a month after the five-star red flag of the People's Republic was raised over Tiananmen Square, Comrade Xiao Jingguang, then serving as the commander and political commissar of the 12th Army Group, was participating in the command of the Hengbao Campaign. As soon as the campaign ended, Chairman Mao telegraphed him to establish the Navy leadership organization and take on the role of Navy commander. Chairman Mao gave three reasons: first, he was an old comrade who could bring revolutionary traditions to the Navy; second, building the Navy required learning from the Soviet Union, and he had studied in the Soviet Union and understood Russian; third, the task of building the Navy was heavy, and it required one or two people with rich combat experience to lead. On January 12, 1950, Chairman Mao issued an order from the People's Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People's Government, officially appointing Comrade Xiao Jingguang as the commander of the People's Liberation Army Navy.

	At that time, the Navy forces in the East China and Central South regions had just been established, and the entire Navy construction work was complex and multifaceted. Under the leadership of Comrade Xiao Jingguang, the first Navy construction conference was held, and specific implementation policies and a three-year plan for Navy construction were formulated. Based on his investigations and research, he clearly proposed that Navy construction must "drive in three stakes," namely, the political and ideological stake, the organizational stake, and the technical stake, emphasizing that the political and ideological stake was particularly important. Without this stake, it would be impossible to work under a unified will, and the Party's military construction line, principles, and tasks would not be correctly implemented. Organizational construction and technical construction would also lack guarantees. At the same time, he and other Navy leaders, based on the historical conditions and practical experience of the East China Military Region Navy, studied and determined the organizational principle of "under the absolute leadership of the Communist Party, with workers and peasants as the backbone, with the People's Liberation Army as the foundation, absorbing a large number of revolutionary young intellectuals and scientific and technical personnel, and striving to unite and reform the original Navy personnel to jointly build the people's Navy." Implementing this organizational principle was of great significance in adhering to the Party's leadership and giving full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of various types of personnel. At that time, there were sometimes conflicts between comrades from the army who were of worker and peasant origin and the original Navy personnel. Comrade Xiao Jingguang regarded unity as the lifeblood of the Navy and insisted on "uniting the five lakes and four seas." He repeatedly urged everyone to unite and strive together to build a powerful Navy. At the meeting of officers above the regiment level when the Qingdao Base was established, he spoke earnestly: "If there are problems with unity, who is responsible? I think the superiors should be responsible to the subordinates, the Party members should be responsible to the masses, the military should be responsible to the local authorities, and the old should be responsible to the new. We should make self-criticisms."

	Comrade Xiao Jingguang also paid great attention to inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions and style of our army. He proposed to take the inheritance and carrying forward of the glorious traditions of our army and the establishment of good style of the People's Navy as a fundamental task. The fine traditions and style of the People's Navy, such as "loving the ocean, conquering the ocean," "living on the sea, visiting the shore," "facing the ship and the ocean," and "unity and mutual assistance, sharing the same boat," are all inseparable from Comrade Xiao Jingguang's vigorous promotion and cultivation.

	The Navy is a knowledge-intensive and technically complex branch of the military. Building the People's Navy requires a cadre team that understands technology. To this end, he proposed that "managing the military must emphasize managing the school," and regarded running good schools as a fundamental long-term plan for the Navy. During the three years of the Navy's establishment, several Navy academies, such as the Dalian Naval Academy, Fast Boat School, Submarine School, Naval Aviation School, and Naval Artillery School, were established, and in a few years, tens of thousands of various technical cadres and professional soldiers were trained and assigned to various combat positions in the ship units. Comrade Xiao Jingguang also requested Premier Zhou Enlai's approval to transfer a batch of engineers, professors, and technical personnel from the national industrial departments and from universities such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, Jiaotong University, and Hunan University to the Navy. At the same time, dozens of senior cadres were sent to study at Soviet Navy academies. These measures gradually solved the problem of personnel needed for Navy construction.

	Spirit of Diligence and Practical Work

	Due to the weak economic foundation of old China and the backward shipbuilding industry, the construction of Navy weapons and equipment encountered great difficulties. In 1954, Comrade Xiao Jingguang clearly proposed the development steps for Navy weapons and equipment: the first step was to strive for foreign aid for complete sets of materials, equipment, and technology, and to assemble and manufacture them domestically to establish a certain foundation for shipbuilding; the second step was to digest and absorb foreign technology, carry out imitation, and gradually achieve self-sufficiency of materials and equipment domestically; the third step was to rely on domestic resources, design independently, use domestic materials and equipment, and complete the research and development of the first generation of Navy weapons and equipment. These three steps were in line with the policy of "independence and self-reliance as the mainstay, and seeking foreign aid as a supplement." Although various interferences and setbacks were encountered in the implementation process, the Navy's equipment construction was basically developed according to the above three steps and achieved significant progress.

	How to improve Navy equipment, seek new Navy technology, and catch up with advanced countries in the world was a problem that Comrade Xiao Jingguang often thought about and studied. Through overseas inspections and serious study, he and other Navy leaders reported to the Military Commission and timely proposed not to build old-style ships again, to develop new technologies, and to research and develop advanced weapons and equipment. The opinions of Comrade Xiao Jingguang and others played an important role in guiding the later equipment construction of the Navy. The Navy's research institutions were gradually established, and the research team was expanding day by day. Comrade Xiao Jingguang paid great attention to the construction of the Navy's research team. He often emphasized two viewpoints: first, the development of new technologies should be based on domestic resources; second, the development of Navy equipment must be preceded by scientific research. With the approval of the Military Commission, seven research institutes were established one after another. Later, Comrade Xiao Jingguang proposed to establish the Ship Research Institute, and the Party Central Committee and the Military Commission approved his proposal. This played an active role in promoting the continuous updating and development of Navy weapons and equipment.

	Comrade Xiao Jingguang also attached great importance to the training and combat of the Navy. The first high-level cadre battle training of the Navy was held under his leadership. In November 1955, the Navy participated in a large-scale exercise organized by the General Staff Department of the Military Commission in the Liaodong Peninsula, with more than 60 ships and 7,500 people participating, and Comrade Xiao Jingguang was the overall commander of the Navy. After the artillery bombardment of Jinmen began in 1958, he rushed to the front line to inspect the artillery positions, ship assembly points, and visit the wounded and sick soldiers. He also gave a lecture on Chairman Mao's military thoughts to officers above the regiment level, which greatly encouraged the frontline officers and soldiers.

	In August 1957, Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou held a meeting in Qingdao. Comrade Xiao Jingguang reported the situation of the Navy to the Chairman and invited the Chairman to see the Navy. The Chairman was very happy. On the day of the inspection, Chairman Mao, due to a cold, entrusted Premier Zhou to inspect. After the inspection, the Premier praised and encouraged the Navy. After that, Comrade Xiao Jingguang continuously went deep into the troops to investigate the training situation and summarized six links to grasp the training: the Party committee leadership, the chief in charge; the organizational leadership of the training department on training; the establishment of the business director's work system; the planned cultivation of ship commanders; the retention of a certain proportion of professional sergeants; the correct proportion of old soldiers demobilizing and new soldiers boarding ships. After implementing this, it effectively promoted the regularization of Navy training.

	Strong Proletarian Party Spirit

	In the course of struggling for the Navy cause, Comrade Xiao Jingguang encountered various difficulties and setbacks, and experienced many hardships. But with his firm communist faith and indomitable fighting spirit, he insisted on truth, sought truth from facts, considered the overall situation, and strictly observed discipline, showing the lofty proletarian party spirit of a communist.

	In 1964, he braved pressure, removed interference, and led the broad cadres and soldiers of the Navy to actively learn and promote the Guo Xingfu teaching method, striving to improve the military technology level of the troops. He firmly opposed Li Zuopeng's policy of excluding dissidents and appointing cronies and insisted on the policy of appointing the talented. After the Cultural Revolution began, he did not yield to the persecution and harassment of the Lin Biao and Li Zuopeng clique and continued to fight. In 1969, at the Party's Ninth Central Committee's First Plenary Session, he resolutely did not vote for the main members of the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques. Under extremely difficult conditions, he still cared about the construction of the Navy. When he learned that the research and development of nuclear submarines encountered difficulties, he, despite his own difficult situation, ran around and coordinated in various ways to avoid the interruption of this work. In 1972, he consecutively presided over seven professional working conferences of the Navy, striving to revitalize and develop the Navy cause. Comrade Xiao Jingguang despised Jiang Qing's investigation of his non-vote at the Ninth Central Committee's First Plenary Session and despised the tyranny of the "Gang of Four." In September and October 1976, he twice met with Comrade Ye Jianying and made important suggestions for the smashing of the "Gang of Four." Despite being in an adverse situation, he still treated his work with a high sense of revolutionary cause and responsibility, without calculating personal gains and losses. He repeatedly went deep into the grassroots to investigate and study and submitted several suggestions on Navy combat, equipment construction, and other items to the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. In August 1977, based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instruction that "the military should raise education and training to a strategic position," he proposed important opinions from seven aspects, including the strategic tasks and combat guidance thoughts of the Navy. He firmly supported the various lines, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and made unremitting efforts for the modernization construction of the Navy. Comrade Xiao Jingguang dedicated his life to the revolutionary cause and the Navy cause. His life was a revolutionary life, a life of struggle for communism.

	In his later years, Comrade Xiao Jingguang often wrote with a brush, "The autumn wind is strong once a year, not like spring, but better than spring, the vast sky and river are covered with frost." These are the words on the scroll given to Comrade Xiao Jingguang by Comrade Mao Zedong. He saw the development and growth of the Navy and saw that the Navy cause had successors, and he felt extremely gratified. Comrade Xiao Jingguang worked in the Navy for 30 years and made indelible contributions to the construction and development of the Navy. The Navy officers and soldiers will never forget our first commander, General Xiao Jingguang, and will inherit his will and strive unremittingly to build a powerful Navy with modern combat capabilities!

　　悼念我们的司令员——肖劲光大将
    中国人民解放军海军
    肖劲光同志是我党久经考验的忠诚的共产主义战士，杰出的无产阶级革命家、军事家，国家和军队的优秀领导人，我军卓越的军事指挥员，中国人民解放军海军敬爱的司令员。他在海军工作了整整３０年，为海军建设献出了毕生的精力。人民海军从小到大、从弱到强发展的历史，都与肖劲光的名字联系在一起。他的逝世，是我党我军的重大损失。海军全体官兵怀着极其沉痛的心情，深切悼念这位德高望重的司令员，并以十分怀念的心情，追忆他为人民海军建设所建立的卓著功勋。
    可贵的艰苦创业精神
    １９４９年１０月，人民共和国的五星红旗在天安门广场刚升起半个月，当时担任第十二兵团司令员兼政治委员的肖劲光同志正在参加指挥衡宝战役。战役刚刚结束，毛泽东主席即电令召见他，要他组建海军领导机构，出任海军司令。毛主席当时讲了三点理由：一是他是个老同志，能把革命传统带到海军；二是建设海军要向苏联学习，他曾在苏联学习过，懂俄语；三是海军建设任务很重，搞海军要有一、两个有丰富实战经验的人去领头。１９５０年１月１２日毛主席签发中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会命令，正式任命肖劲光同志为中国人民解放军海军司令员。
    当时，华东、中南地区的海军部队刚刚组建，整个海军建设工作千头万绪。在肖劲光同志的主持下召开了海军首届建军会议，制订了海军建设的具体实施方针和三年规划。他在调查研究的基础上，明确地提出了海军建设必须“打好三个桩子”，即政治思想桩子、组织桩子、技术桩子，并强调特别重要的是政治思想桩子。这个桩子如果不巩固，就不可能在统一的意志下进行工作，党的建军路线、方针和任务，也就不可能正确的执行，组织建设、技术建设也就没有保证。同时，他还和海军其他领导同志一起，根据当时的历史条件和华东军区海军的实践经验，研究确定了“在共产党的绝对领导之下，以工农为骨干，以解放军为基础，吸收大量革命的青年知识分子和科学技术人员，争取团结和改造原海军人员，共同建设人民的海军”的组织原则。贯彻这一组织原则，对坚持党的领导，发挥各类人员的革命积极性有着重要意义。当时，从陆军调来的工农出身的同志与原海军人员之间有时产生一些矛盾。肖劲光同志把团结当成海军的生命，坚持搞“五湖四海”，多次要求大家团结一致，共同为建设强大的海军而奋斗。他在青岛基地成立时的师以上干部会议上语重心长地说：“团结出了问题，谁负责？我看上级要对下级负责，党员要向群众负责，军队要向地方负责，老的要向新的负责，要作自我批评。”
    肖劲光同志还十分重视继承和发扬我军的优良传统和作风，他提出要把继承和发扬我军光荣传统，树立人民海军的良好作风，作为一项根本任务。人民海军部队在长期的斗争实践中形成的具有海军特色的优良作风，如“热爱海洋、征服海洋”，“海上为家、岸上作客”，“面向舰艇、面向海洋”，“团结友爱、同舟共济”等等都是与肖劲光同志的大力倡导和培养分不开的。
    海军是一个知识密集、技术复杂的军种。建设人民海军需要一支懂技术的干部队伍。为此，他提出“治军必须重视治校”，把办好学校作为海军长远建设的根本大计。海军在创建阶段的３年中，就先后开办了大连海校、快艇学校、潜艇学校、海军航空学校、海军炮兵学校等多所海军军校，几年内先后培养了数万名各类技术干部和专业兵，分配到舰艇部队各个战斗岗位。肖劲光同志还请示周恩来总理同意，从国家工业部门和清华大学、北京大学、交通大学、湖南大学等高等院校，调来了海军一批工程师、教授和技术人员。同时，派出几十名高级干部到苏联海军院校学习。这一项项措施，逐步解决了海军建设急需的人材。
    发奋求实的工作作风
    由于旧中国经济基础薄弱，造船工业落后，海军的武器装备建设遇到了极大的困难。１９５４年，肖劲光同志明确提出了海军武器装备的发展步骤：第一步，争取国外援助成套材料、设备和技术，在国内装配制造，建立造船的一定基础；第二步，消化、吸收国外技术，进行仿制，逐步做到材料、设备国内自给；第三步，立足国内，自行设计，使用国产材料、设备，完成海军第一代武器装备的研制。这三个步骤贯串“独立自主、自力更生为主，争取外援为辅”的方针。后来尽管在实施过程中遇到过种种干扰和挫折，但海军的装备建设基本上是按照上述三个步骤发展起来的，并取得了重大进展。
    如何改进海军装备，谋求海军新技术，赶上世界先进国家，这是肖劲光同志经常思考研究的问题。他通过出国考察和认真研究，与海军其他领导同志一起向军委报告，及时提出不宜再造老式舰艇，要发展新技术，研制尖端武器装备的建议。肖劲光等同志的这些意见对后来海军的装备建设起了重要的指导作用，海军的科研机构逐步建立起来，科研队伍也日益扩大。肖司令员对海军科研队伍建设很重视。他经常强调两个观点：一是新技术发展要立足国内；二是海军装备发展必须科研先行。经军委同意，先后成立了７个研究所。后来，肖劲光又提出要成立舰艇研究院，党中央和军委批准了他的建议。这在促进海军武器装备的不断更新和发展中起了积极作用。
    肖司令员对海军的训练和作战也十分重视。海军第一次高级干部战役集训就是他主持的。１９５５年１１月，海军部队参加了军委总参在辽东半岛组织的一次大规模演习，海军有６０多艘舰艇，７５００多人参加，肖司令员是海军方面总指挥。１９５８年炮击金门战斗打响后，他就赶到前线，视察炮阵地、舰艇集结地，看望伤病员，还给团以上干部讲毛主席的军事思想，对前线官兵鼓舞很大。
    １９５７年８月，毛主席、周总理在青岛开会，肖司令员向主席汇报海军情况，请主席看看海军，主席很高兴。检阅那天，毛主席由于患感冒委托周总理去检阅。总理检阅后表扬和鼓励了海军。此后，肖劲光同志连续深入部队调查训练情况，总结出抓好训练的６个环节，即党委领导，首长分工；健全训练部门对训练的组织领导；健全业务长的工作制度；有计划地培养舰艇长；保留一定比例的专业军士；老兵复员新兵上舰要有正确比例。照此实施后，有力地促进了海军正规化训练。
    坚强的无产阶级党性
    肖劲光同志在为海军事业奋斗的过程中，遇到了种种艰难险阻，历经坎坷。但他以坚定的共产主义信念和百折不挠的斗争精神，坚持真理，实事求是，顾全大局，严守纪律，表现了共产党人崇高的无产阶级党性。
    １９６４年，他顶着压力，排除干扰，领导海军广大指战员积极学习推广郭兴福教学方法，努力提高部队的军事技术水平。他坚决反对李作鹏排除异己、任人唯亲的干部政策，坚持任人唯贤的干部政策。“文化大革命”开始以后，他不屈从于林彪、李作鹏一伙的打击迫害，继续坚持斗争。１９６９年，在党的九届一中全会选举中央政治局委员时，他断然不投林彪、江青两个反革命集团的主要成员的票。他在极其困难的条件下，仍关心着海军的建设。当他得知核潜艇的研制工作遇到困难时，便不顾自己的艰难处境，四处奔走，多方协调，避免了该项工作的中断。１９７２年，他连续主持召开了海军七个专业工作会议，努力振兴和发展海军事业。肖劲光同志蔑视江青对他九届一中全会不投票的追究，蔑视“四人帮”的淫威。１９７６年９、１０月间，他两次找叶剑英同志，对粉碎“四人帮”提出重要的建议。他身居逆境，仍以高度的革命事业心和责任感对待工作，毫不计较个人得失。他不断深入基层调查研究，数次向党中央、中央军委递交关于海军作战、装备建设等项建议。１９７７年８月，他根据邓小平同志“军队要把教育训练提高到战略地位”的指示，从海军的战略任务、作战指导思想等七个方面，提出了重要意见。他坚决拥护党的十一届三中全会以来的各项路线、方针、政策，为海军的现代化建设作了不懈的努力。肖劲光同志把毕生的精力献给了革命事业，献给了海军事业，他的一生，是革命的一生，为共产主义事业奋斗的一生。
    肖劲光同志晚年常挥毫书写“一年一度秋风劲，不似春光，胜似春光，寥廓江天万里霜。”这是毛泽东同志送给肖劲光同志条幅上的词。他看到海军的发展壮大，看到海军事业后继有人，感到无比欣慰。肖劲光同志在海军工作了３０个春秋，为海军建设和发展作出了不可磨灭的贡献。海军指战员永远不会忘记我们的首任司令员——肖劲光大将，并将继承他的遗志，为建立一支强大的具有现代战斗能力的海军而不懈奋斗！
