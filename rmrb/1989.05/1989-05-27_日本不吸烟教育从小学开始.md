Japan has officially incorporated anti-smoking education into its primary school curriculum. This new regulation is a response to the realization that starting anti-smoking education in middle school is too late.

The Ministry of Education has issued a special guidebook for this purpose, outlining educational content and requirements for different grades. The goal is to help children understand air pollution and the importance of personal health, recognizing that smoking not only harms the individual but also pollutes the surrounding air and affects others. The aim is to cultivate in children a correct understanding and judgment of smoking, encouraging them to make a conscious decision to never smoke.

In teaching children about the dangers of smoking, the guidebook advocates for visual and hands-on methods. For example, in the fourth grade, students can observe experiments where earthworms die in tobacco solution. In the fifth grade, they can view images showing changes in human capillaries and skin temperature after smoking.

The guidebook also suggests that education should be integrated with classroom activities and natural science lessons, and that it should involve cooperation from families and society. It also advises against children adopting incorrect attitudes towards adults who smoke, such as criticizing their parents for smoking.

　　日本不吸烟教育从小学开始
    日本已正式把防止学生吸烟纳入小学教育内容。这是针对禁烟教育从初中阶段开始为时已晚而作的新规定。
    文部省（即教育部）为此专门颁发了辅导教育手册，按小学不同年级提出了教育内容和要求：从使儿童认识空气污染、关心人身健康入手，认识吸烟不仅有害自己，而且污染周围空气，影响他人，培养儿童对吸烟建立起正确的认识和判断能力，决心自觉地一辈子不吸烟。
    在指导儿童认识烟害时采取直观的做法，如在四年级进行实验观察蚯蚓在烟草溶液里怎样死去；在五年级展示吸烟后人体毛细血管血液循环和皮肤温度变化的图片等。
    手册还提出，指导教育要和班级活动以及自然科学教学结合，并且取得家庭和社会的配合。还要防止儿童对现在吸烟的成年人采取不正确的做法，如不要把自己家长的吸烟行为看做坏事加以指责等等。
