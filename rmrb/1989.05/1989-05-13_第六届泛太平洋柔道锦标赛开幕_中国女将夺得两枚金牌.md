The sixth Pan-Pacific Judo Championships opened today in the newly constructed Yuetan Gymnasium.

Chinese champion Gao Fenglian struck first, winning the gold medal in the women's 72kg+ category. Later, Chinese athlete Zhang Di also secured the gold medal in the 66kg category. However, out of the eight finals held today, the Japanese team won six gold medals, including all four men's titles, truly living up to their reputation as the "Judo Kingdom."

The gold medals won by the Japanese team are as follows: Men's 95kg+ category, Kimino Jun; 95kg category, Haga Yoshio; 86kg category, Sonoda Masaki; 78kg category, Takabayashi Yoshiyuki; Women's 72kg category, Tanabe Yoko; 61kg category, Kobayashi Takako.

Today's matches were highly competitive, drawing enthusiastic applause from the audience. Gao Fenglian defeated her teammate Zhang Ying with a one-point advantage, pinning Zhang down completely. The matches in the women's 61kg and men's 95kg categories were particularly intense, with both pairs of athletes struggling for victory. After five minutes of intense competition, neither pair had scored a point, forcing the referee to decide the winner by raising the flag.

Deputy Director of the Competition Committee Shi Jiyu commented: The Japanese team has a significant advantage in both strength and technique, especially in the men's categories, where other teams find it difficult to compete. China's female athletes performed exceptionally well, maintaining a psychological edge and normal technical performance. Previously, their fixed techniques were weak, but this time they have shown significant improvement.

　　第六届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛开幕    
    中国女将夺得两枚金牌
    本报北京５月１３日讯  记者黄振中报道：第六届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛今天在新建的月坛体育馆隆重开幕。
    中国名将高凤莲先声报捷，夺得女子７２公斤以上级金牌，继后中国姑娘张迪又夺得６６公斤级金牌。然而今天进行的８项决赛，日本队共夺得６枚金牌，其中男子４项冠军全为其所获，果然是柔道王国。
    日本队夺得的金牌是：男子９５公斤以上级金野润、９５公斤级羽贺善夫、８６公斤级园田雅明、７８公斤级高波善行；女子两枚金牌是７２公斤级田边阳子、６１公斤级小林贵子。
    今天比赛十分精采，激起观众阵阵掌声。高凤莲以一本的优势战胜队友张颖，她全身压抱住张颖，使其动弹不得。女子６１公斤和男子９５公斤级更为激烈，两对选手争夺难分难解，打满５分钟仍互不得分，最后裁判只好举旗判定胜负。
    竞赛委员会副主任史吉玉评述说：日本队无论是力量和技术都占很大的优势，尤其是男子，别的队几乎难以撼动。中国的女选手表现出色，心理上占上风，技术发挥正常。以前固技较差，这一次也发生很大变化，有进步。
