On the way to Jingdezhen, many people mentioned going to the night market. After checking into the hotel, our local friends also said that to understand the Porcelain Capital, one should go to the night market.

The night market is set up next to the plaza, at the southern end of Lian She Nan Road. Here, both sides of the street are lined with small shops selling daily-use porcelain, decorative porcelain, and industrial porcelain. On the street, one side has clothing stalls, and the other side has porcelain stalls. After dusk, the clothing stalls retreat, and countless small porcelain stalls emerge from both sides. This is a true porcelain street, without any newly decorated luxurious stores, without dazzling lights, and without popular songs playing to attract customers. There are only various porcelain items made from kaolin. There are complete sets of tableware, stationery, tea sets, coffee sets, and more. There are also individual items like bowls, plates, cups, saucers, and spoons. There are traditional porcelain types like blue and white, celadon, famille rose, and colored glazes, as well as art porcelain like thin-bodied and sculpted pieces. The most common are tableware. Another notable and attractive item is the various styles of Eastern Venus figures—dripping water Guanyin, child-bestowing Guanyin, lotus-sitting Guanyin, blue and white Doucai Guanyin, and so on.

Because I visited frequently, I got to know an elderly man in his sixties who sat at the southern end. He told me that the stalls here include individual proprietors, township-run, and state-owned ceramic enterprises, as well as porcelain shops from other streets. Most of them are small traders. Buying from these stalls might not be the cheapest, but the goods are genuine and reasonably priced, so buyers can rest assured. I asked him what to be cautious about, and he just smiled without answering. Gradually, I figured it out. Some young people dressed in a Hong Kong style, carrying a dripping water Guanyin or an antique vase, would weave through the crowd, asking, “Want to buy?” A 14-inch dripping water Guanyin usually costs 14 yuan, but they would sell it for 9 to 10 yuan and could even negotiate the price. Out-of-towners would pick and choose for a long time, only to find out back at the hotel, with others pointing it out, that they had bought a repaired defective item. The old man said that most people are honest and law-abiding, but there are a few who sell cheaply.

One evening, the old man's son brought him dinner, which included fish and meat, quite good. The old man praised the current policies as being in line with the people's wishes, with a lively market and hope for the common people. His son worked as a kiln worker in a small collective, and he did some porcelain business to help his son buy a color TV, refrigerator, and washing machine, allowing his son to get married.

I asked him how much he could earn in a month, and he avoided the question. At that moment, in front of his stall, his son, who was helping him, got into an argument with two customers. The old man walked over and said to the two customers, “This is the price, no more discounts. This is the lowest wholesale price in the city.” I gradually understood that the old man not only sold retail but also did wholesale business, dealing with many factories. The two customers walked around the night market and eventually returned to the old man's stall, willing to buy his goods.

I wanted to buy ten small red flower vegetable bowls to match my home's tableware. He frankly said that the items on the stall were leftovers, and asked me to come back the next day. The next evening, he pointed to the ten vegetable bowls that were already neatly packed, saying that he had picked them out for me, all good, asking if I trusted him.

More and more people came to stroll the night market. Suddenly, at one stall, I found the 150-piece green and white porcelain bowls with trays that I had been looking for but hadn't found, priced at 20 yuan for a pair. In a store, a smaller 100-piece porcelain bowl set was priced at 35 yuan for a pair. I haggled to 16 yuan, and the stall owner waved his hand: 18 yuan, sold.

I hesitated for a moment, as the already heavy luggage would be increased by a pair of bulky and hard-to-carry porcelain bowls. I didn't know when a young woman squatted beside me, telling me that these flower bowls were cheap and good, and she even helped me pick them out. I finally made up my mind. After choosing, she asked, “Do you want it wrapped? It's easier to carry if wrapped, and it won't matter if it gets bumped.”

Jingdezhen has a unique profession: people waiting on the street to wrap porcelain for customers. I followed her through half the street to a young man under a tree. After giving him some instructions, she went back to the crowd to attract more business.

The young man squatted and sat, wrapping tea sets under the light from a nearby shop, his hands and feet very nimble. After the woman left, he wrapped my two porcelain bowls with newspaper, placing them in two trays, with a thick layer of straw at the bottom. He laid the bowls horizontally on the straw ropes, rolling and twisting the straw ropes to tightly bind the large, bulky, and fragile items.

We chatted, and I learned that he was a worker at the power plant in the town, and the woman who attracted customers was his wife. His wife patrolled the stalls, and as soon as a deal was made, she enthusiastically went forward, while he waited under the tree. He said that their incomes were not high, they had a child, and various expenses were quite high. “The main thing is that I am studying at night school, and the cost of books is quite high. I can only earn some money on nights when I don't have classes. I can make about ten yuan a night, which is not bad.” Saying this, he used the rope to reinforce the overall binding of the porcelain bowls, took out scissors, and carefully cut off the irregular straw sticking out.

### 瓷都夜市

　　瓷都夜市
    涂吉安
    在去景德镇市的途中，许多人就说要上夜市。在宾馆下榻时，接待我们的当地朋友也说，要了解瓷都，应该上夜市去看看。
    夜市设在广场旁边，莲社南路的南端。这里，街道两边全是出售日用瓷、陈设瓷与工业用瓷的挤挤挨挨的小店铺，街面上一边是服装摊，一边是摆卖瓷器的地摊。黄昏过后，服装摊撤退了，两边拥出无数的卖瓷器的小地摊。这是一条真正的瓷器街，没有装修一新的豪华店面，没有明光耀眼的灯火，没有为招徕顾客而播放的流行歌曲，只有以高岭土为原料烧制的各种瓷器。既有餐具、文具、茶具、咖啡具等成套瓷器，又有可供配套的各种碗、盘、杯、碟、调羹等单件瓷。既有青花、玲珑、粉彩、颜色釉等传统瓷，又有薄胎，雕塑等工艺瓷。最多的是餐具。还一个多且吸引人的是各种造型、各种风格的东方维纳斯——滴水站鳌观音，送子观音，坐莲观音，青花斗彩观音，等等。
    因为来得勤，我结识了坐守南端的一个６０多岁的老人。他告诉我，在这里摆摊设点的，有个体、乡办、国营的陶瓷企业，也有其他街道的瓷器店，更多的还是小商小贩。购买这些摊店的瓷器，也许价格不是最便宜的，但货真价也廉，买主尽可放心。我问他，什么才需当心，他说你自己看吧，竟含笑不答。慢慢地，我看出来了。有些青年，港式打扮，手托一尊滴水观音或仿古花瓶，像游鱼般钻来钻去，逢人便问：“买啵？”１４英寸滴水观音出厂价一般要１４元，他只要九到十元，还可以让价。外地人挑拣了半天，拿回旅舍经别人指点才发现，花钱买了一个修补过的残次品。老人说，做贱的只是少数，绝大多数都是正正经经奉公守法的生意人。
    有天傍晚，老人的儿子给他送来晚饭，有鱼有肉很不错的。老人极力称赞现今的政策符合民心，市场活跃，老百姓有盼头。儿子在小集体当窑工，他做点瓷器生意，帮助儿子添制了彩电冰箱洗衣机，让儿子成了亲。
    我问他一个月能赚多少，他“王顾左右而言他”。这时，前头地摊上，帮他守摊的儿子与两个顾客发生争吵。老人走过去，对那两个顾客说：“就这个价，不能再压了，这是全市最低的批发价。”我渐渐明白了老人不仅零售，还兼批发，与许多厂家有业务联系。那两个顾客到夜市各处走了走，最后还是回到老人身边，愿意进他的货。
    我想买十个小红花菜碗，与家里的餐具配套。他坦率地说摊子上是挑剩的货，要我明天再来。第二天晚上，他指着已经包扎妥贴的十个菜碗，说是他帮我挑选的，个个都好，问我信不信。
    逛夜市的人越聚越多。突然在一个地摊上，发现我想买却一直没有买到的１５０件带托盘的青花瓷钵，一对只要２０元。在商店，比这小得多的１００件瓷钵，一对标价３５元。我还价１６元，摊主手一挥：１８元，卖给你。
    我一时有些犹豫，在本来就很沉重的行李中，将增加一对笨重且不好带的瓷钵。不知什么时候，一个年轻女子蹲在我身边，告诉我这种花钵价廉物美，且主动帮我挑选。我终于下定决心。选妥后，她问：“要捆扎么？捆好了带走方便，磕磕碰碰都不要紧。”
    景德镇有种全国少有的“专业户”：在街市等着专为顾客购买的瓷器进行包装。我跟她穿过半条街，走到一颗树下的男青年跟前。交待了几句以后，她又到顾客中招揽生意去了。
    男青年半蹲半坐，就着店铺里射来的灯光包扎茶具，手脚十分麻利。女青年走后，他将我的两只瓷钵用报纸隔开，垒放在两个托盘上，以一卷厚实的稻草垫在底部，将瓷钵横倒在稻草搓成的粗绳上，不断地滚动，不断地搓草绳，让稻草绳密密实实地捆绑住那对又大又笨并且易碎的家伙。
    我们聊天，知道他是镇上发电厂工人，那个招揽生意的女人是他的妻子。妻子在摊档上巡视，一见成交，立即热情地迎向前去，他则在树下“守株待兔”。他说，他们俩人收入都不高，有一个小孩，各项费用又蛮贵的。“主要的是，我在读夜校，书籍费，要花不少的钱，只好利用没有课的晚上挣一点。一个晚上也能弄十多块钱，还可以吧？”说着，用绳子从整体上加固捆好了的瓷钵，拿出剪子把斜伸在外的不规矩的稻草轻轻剪掉。
