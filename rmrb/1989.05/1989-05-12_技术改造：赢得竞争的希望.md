Facing the challenge of the 1992 European unified market and numerous powerful competitors, the chairman of the Fiat Group, Agnelli, responded: the hope for winning the competition lies in technological renovation. The Fiat Automobile Company's Cassino Automobile Factory is a microcosm of Fiat's technological renovation. Recently, the author was invited to interview the new equipment at this factory after its renovation.

Moving Towards Automated Flexible Systems

The Cassino Automobile Factory is located in the suburbs of Cassino, between Rome and Naples. It was completed and put into operation in 1972. The factory originally produced some mid-to-low-end small cars, with a daily production of 1,200 vehicles and 5,800 employees. This level was not low, but to cope with the increasingly fierce competition, Fiat Automobile Company invested 190 billion lire (approximately $1.5 billion) to thoroughly renovate the factory. The number of employees increased to 7,000, and the production capacity was raised to 1,800 vehicles per day. At the beginning of last year, the Fiat's latest series product, the "Tipo" small car, was launched. The technological renovation has taken a significant step towards an automated flexible production system at the Cassino factory.

More Robots Than People

Accompanying the tour, Engineer Milioni introduced that the Cassino factory extensively adopted information technology. Its information management system is divided into three levels: the factory's central management system, the management centers of various workshops, and robots, single machines, and machine groups. This information management system coordinates various complex automated equipment: 109 electronic computers of different sizes, over 500 image displays and program controllers, 439 various robots, 61 laser machines, 49 observation systems, and 570 automatic vehicles. The entire factory's production, logistics, and management have achieved a high degree of automation.

In the stamping workshop, large steel plates coming out of the "stamping center" are already shaped parts of the "Tipo" car's exterior. In the plastic processing workshop, a unique automated equipment in the world molds plastic into the large rear cover of the "Tipo" car. In the welding workshop, the shaped car body parts are grouped and welded, then assembled into the entire car body. A car body has 2,954 welding points, all welded by robots. This workshop alone has 186 electric welding robots, 47 operating robots, 7 sealing robots, two "robot islands"—the first laser welding machines in the automotive industry, 2 laser inspection machines, and 4 automatic inspection robots. In the final assembly workshop, various mechanical parts are automatically assembled in groups, checked automatically, and then transported in an orderly manner by numerous automatic vehicles to their respective positions. Various robots accurately and error-free install various grouped components inside and outside the car body like individual parts. It is said that this is the most modern automobile assembly workshop in the world. The overall impression is that in these workshops, the "working" robots far outnumber the humans.

Advantages of Automation

According to Engineer Milioni, the Cassino Automobile Factory achieved full automation through equipment updates. Its advantages are: first, unprecedented automation ensures high product quality, which is the fundamental guarantee for winning the competition. Second, it has great flexibility. The automated equipment here can produce various models and modified products according to market and customer-specific requirements on the same equipment. These devices can be slightly modified or adjusted to switch production, thus coping with the ever-changing market demand. Third, high automation has changed the factory's production organization. Traditional assembly lines and production lines have almost disappeared, replaced by group assembly, which is a significant innovation, greatly improving working conditions and eliminating heavy manual operations. Fourth, the automation here has not led to unemployment but instead has provided new job opportunities.

The technological renovation of Fiat's Cassino Automobile Factory is a success. The Italian Prime Minister De Mita personally attended the inauguration ceremony of the new equipment and delivered a speech, praising the Cassino Automobile Factory as "a symbol of Italy's future-oriented production and innovation."

### 技术改造：赢得竞争的希望

　　技术改造：赢得竞争的希望
    本报记者  罗晋标
    面临１９９２年欧洲统一大市场的挑战，面对许多强大的竞争对手，意大利菲亚特集团董事长阿涅利的回答是：赢得竞争的希望在于技术改造。菲亚特汽车公司卡西诺汽车厂是该公司技术改造的一个缩影。最近作者应邀采访了该厂改造后的新设备。
    向自动化整体柔性系统迈进
    卡西诺汽车厂位于罗马和那不勒斯之间的卡西诺市郊，１９７２年建成投产。该厂原来生产一些中低档小轿车，日产１２００辆，职工５８００人。这个水平并不低，但为了对付日益激烈的竞争，菲亚特汽车公司耗资１．９万亿里拉（约合１５亿美元），对该厂进行了彻底的技术改造。职工增至７０００人，生产能力提高到日产１８００辆。去年初推出了菲亚特最新系列产品“蒂波”型小轿车。技术改造使卡西诺厂向自动化的整体柔性生产系统迈出了重要的一步。
    机器人比真人多
    陪同参观的米里奥尼工程师介绍说，卡西诺厂大量采用了信息技术，其信息管理系统分为三级：全厂的中央管理系统，各车间的管理中心，机器人、单机和机组。这个信息管理系统协调着各种复杂的自动化设备：１０９台不同规模的电子计算机，５００多台图像显示器和程序控制器，４３９台各式机器人，６１台激光机，４９个观测系统，５７０辆自动车，整个厂的生产、后勤、管理均实现了高度的自动化。
    在模压车间里，大块钢板从“冲压机中心”出来的便是成形的“蒂波”车外壳的各部分。在塑料加工车间里，据说是世界独一无二的一套自动化设备把塑料模压成“蒂波”车大后盖。在焊接车间里，成形的车壳各部分分组焊接，接着组成整个车壳，一个车壳共有２９５４个焊接点，全部由机器人焊接，仅这个车间就有１８６台电焊机器人，４７台操作机器人，７台密封机器人，两个“机器人岛”——汽车工业中首创的激光焊接机，２台激光检查机和４台自动检查机器人。在总装车间里，各机械部件分组自动装配，经自动检查后被许多自动车有秩序地分别运送到位，各种机器人准确无误地把各种分组部件像单个零件一样安装在车壳内外，据介绍，这是世界最现代化的汽车装配车间。总的印象是，在这些车间里，“上班”的机器人比真人多得多。
    自动化的优势
    据米里奥尼工程师介绍，卡西诺汽车厂通过设备更新实现全部自动化，其优势，一是前所未有的自动化使产品保持高质量，这是赢得竞争的根本保证。二是极大的灵活性，这里的自动化设备可以按照市场和顾客的具体要求，在同一设备上生产出各种型号和改型的产品，这些设备稍加改变或调整即可转产，以此对付千变万化的市场需求。三是高度的自动化改变了工厂的生产组织，传统的装配线和生产线几乎没有了，代之以分组装配，这是具有重要意义的一项革新，大大改善了劳动条件，消灭了笨重的人工工序。四是这里的自动化并没有带来工人失业，相反却提供了新的就业岗位。
    菲亚特卡西诺汽车厂的技术改造是成功的，意大利总理德米塔亲自出席了该厂新设备落成典礼并发表讲话，称卡西诺汽车厂是“意大利着眼未来的生产与革新的标志”。
