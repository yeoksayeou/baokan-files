The Organization of American States (OAS) delegation ended its four-day visit to Panama on May 27th, but failed to find a solution to the political crisis between the Panamanian government and the opposition.

The delegation, consisting of the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the Secretary-General of the OAS, arrived in Panama City on May 23rd in accordance with the OAS resolution of May 17th. The delegation held talks with Panama's Acting President Solís Palma, military commander Noriega, and the leaders of the ruling and opposition parties, as well as Panama's Archbishop Gregorio. These talks were conducted in secret and under strict security measures.

Ecuador's Foreign Minister Córdova stated at a press conference in Panama City on May 27th that the various parties in Panama have not yet reached any agreement on political reconciliation. However, he denied that the OAS delegation's mediation efforts had "failed." Guatemala's Foreign Minister Palencia believed that Panama's problems could not be resolved in a few days. The delegation will submit a report on their visit to Panama for discussion at the upcoming OAS Foreign Ministers' Meeting on June 6th. He added that if necessary, the delegation would return to Panama for further mediation.

Additionally, military commander Noriega stated on May 27th that the current crisis in Panama was entirely orchestrated and directly intervened by the United States.

He reiterated that the military would not engage in dialogue with the opposition.

However, the opposition leaders insisted on negotiating with the military and demanded that Noriega resign and recognize the opposition as the winners of the May 7th Panamanian elections.

　　美洲国家组织代表团结束访巴
    未找到解决巴拿马问题的方案
    新华社巴拿马城５月２７日电  （记者胡泰然）美洲国家组织代表团２７日结束了对巴拿马的４天访问，但未能找到使巴拿马政府同反对派和解的方案。
    由厄瓜多尔、危地马拉和特立尼达—多巴哥３国外长，以及美洲国家组织秘书长组成的这个代表团是根据美洲国家组织５月１７日的决议于２３日抵达巴拿马城的。代表团分别同巴拿马代总统索利斯·帕尔马、国防军司令诺列加、执政党和反对党的主要领导人以及巴拿马大主教格雷戈里奥就巴拿马政府宣布５月７日大选无效后造成的政治危机进行了会谈。这些会谈都是在秘密的和严格保安措施下进行的。
    厄瓜多尔外长科多韦斯２７日在巴拿马城举行的记者招待会上指出，巴拿马各方至今尚未就政治和解达成任何协议。但他否认美洲国家组织代表团的调解工作已经“失败”。危地马拉外长帕伦西亚认为，巴拿马的问题不可能在几天内得到解决，代表团将就这次巴拿马之行提出报告，供将于６月６日举行的美洲国家组织外长会议讨论。他还说，如有必要，代表团将再次到巴拿马进行调解。
    此外，国防军司令诺列加２７日指出，巴拿马目前的危机完全是美国幕后操纵和直接插手造成的。
    他重申，军方决不同反对派进行对话。
    但是，反对派领导人则坚持要同军方会谈，并要求诺列加辞职和宣布反对派是５月７日巴拿马大选的获胜者。
