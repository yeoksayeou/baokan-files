	At a time when all parts of the country are earnestly cleaning up ongoing projects and striving to reduce the scale of fixed asset investments, the Wuxi Municipal People's Government in Jiangsu Province blatantly ignored repeated directives and explicit regulations from the State Council, unilaterally approving a large number of new construction projects. Recently, with the approval of the State Council, the General Office of the State Council issued a special circular, severely criticizing Wuxi's errors.

	The circular revealed that from October last year to January this year, the Wuxi Municipal Government successively approved 92 new construction projects, with a total construction area of 330,000 square meters and an investment of approximately 200 million yuan. The "Market for Production Materials," with a construction area of 23,000 square meters and an investment of 45 million yuan, is clearly a project for the construction of office buildings. The municipal government falsified records, excluding land acquisition, demolition, and equipment investment from the investment budget to keep the total investment at around 28 million yuan, thereby avoiding the need to submit a project proposal and commencement report, as well as an audit by the audit department, in violation of the "Temporary Regulations on the Management of Office Building Construction."

	The Youth Activity Center, the Radio and Television Building, and the main building of the Municipal Power and Communications Building in Wuxi are also office building projects. Last October, during the cleanup, the completion rate for these projects did not exceed 50%, and they should have been suspended. However, the municipal government still allowed construction to continue.

	The circular stated that the actions of the Wuxi Municipal Government are seriously erroneous.

	To uphold discipline and law enforcement, the State Council decided: to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government to handle the main responsible persons of the Wuxi Municipal Government in accordance with relevant State Council documents; the Wuxi Municipal Government must conduct a thorough self-examination and take serious action against relevant personnel, and all related projects must immediately stop construction. The Jiangsu Provincial Government is also required to report the handling results to the State Council.

　　有法不依　有令不行　有禁不止    
    无锡擅自批准新上大批项目    
    国务院责成江苏省府严肃处理
    本报北京５月１５日讯  记者鲁牧报道：正当全国各地认真清理在建项目、努力压缩固定资产投资规模之际，江苏省无锡市人民政府竟然无视国务院三令五申和一系列明文规定，擅自批准新开工一大批建设项目。经国务院批准，最近国务院办公厅专门发出通报，对无锡市的错误进行了严厉批评。
    《通报》披露，在去年１０月至今年１月期间，无锡市政府先后批准新开工项目９２个，总建筑面积３３万平方米，总投资２亿元左右。建筑面积为２．３万平方米、投资４５００万元的“市生产资料综合市场”，实属楼堂馆所项目。市政府弄虚作假，将征地拆迁和设备投资甩在投资概算之外，以使总投资定在２８００多万元，从而不按规定报批项目建议书和开工报告以及审计部门审计，严重违反了《楼堂馆所建设管理暂行条例》。
    无锡市青年活动中心、市广播电视大楼、市交电大楼主楼等工程，也都属楼堂馆所项目。去年１０月清理时，完成工作量都未超过５０％，理应停缓建。但市政府却仍准予继续建设。
    《通报》说，无锡市政府的作法，错误是十分严重的。
    为严肃法纪政纪，国务院决定：责成江苏省人民政府按国务院有关文件规定，对无锡市政府主要负责人进行严肃处理；无锡市政府要做出深刻检查，并对有关人员进行严肃处理，有关项目要立即停止建设。还要求江苏省政府将处理结果上报国务院。
