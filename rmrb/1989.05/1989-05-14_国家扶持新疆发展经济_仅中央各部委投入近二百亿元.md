The state has invested more than 500 million yuan to support the construction of the South Xinjiang Zepu Petrochemical Plant in Xinjiang, which has been completed and started trial production after three years of intensive construction. This is one of the major key projects in the state's support for Xinjiang's economic development.

For a long time, in order to develop the economic construction of the border minority areas, the state has provided substantial assistance and support to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in terms of funds, materials, and talent and technology. According to statistics, so far, the cumulative fixed asset investment by various central ministries and commissions in Xinjiang has reached nearly 2 billion yuan.

In view of the weak economic foundation of Xinjiang, the state has, over the years, successively built some people-benefiting projects and infrastructure projects in the ethnic concentration areas of Xinjiang. The Kashgar Second Power Station on the edge of the Taklamakan Desert has been included in the central key subsidy projects, and the Tashkurgan Power Station on the Pamir Plateau has also been included in the central special subsidy projects. Recently, the development and construction of the northern part of the Tarim Basin oil and gas field has been launched, and the state has specially established an exploration and development command center here. The 140,000-ton ethylene project in Xinjiang Dushanzi, jointly invested by central departments and Xinjiang local authorities with 2.4 billion yuan, is also being actively prepared.

Currently, the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway West Section - Northern Xinjiang Railway, jointly built by the central and local governments, has laid tracks to Wusu last year and is now continuing to extend forward. It is expected to connect with the Soviet Union's railway in 1990. The 240-kilometer section that has been opened to traffic is now operating temporary passenger and freight services. The state has invested 540 million yuan to build the Xinjiang cotton and sugar production base, which has completed the annual construction plan in excess last year.

　　国家扶持新疆发展经济    
    仅中央各部委投入近二百亿元
    新华社乌鲁木齐５月１４日电  国家投资５亿多元扶持新疆建设的南疆泽普石油化工厂，经过三年的紧张施工，最近正式建成并全面试产。这是国家支援新疆发展经济建设的主要重点工程之一。
    长期以来，为了发展边疆少数民族地区的经济建设，国家从资金上、物资上、人才技术上给了新疆维吾尔自治区大力帮助和扶持，据统计，目前，仅中央各部委在新疆的固定资产投资已累计近２００亿元。
    针对新疆经济基础薄弱的实际，多年来，国家在新疆民族聚集区陆续兴建了一些为民造福项目和基础建设项目。塔克拉玛干大沙漠边缘的喀什二级电站被列入中央重点补助项目，帕米尔高原上的塔什库尔干电站也列入中央专项补助。最近，规模巨大的塔里木盆地北部地区油气田的开发建设已拉开序幕，国家在这里专门成立了勘探开发指挥部。由中央部门和新疆地方联合投资２４亿元的新疆独山子１４万吨乙烯工程也正在积极筹建。
    现在，中央和地方合资建设的兰新铁路西段——北疆铁路，去年已铺轨到乌苏，现又继续向前延伸，预计１９９０年可与苏联铁路接轨，目前已通车的２４０多公里路段开展了临时客货营运业务。国家投资５．４亿元建设的新疆棉花、糖料生产基地，去年超额完成年度建设计划。
