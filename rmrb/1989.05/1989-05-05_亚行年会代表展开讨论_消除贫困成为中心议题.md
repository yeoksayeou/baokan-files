	Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting Representatives Discuss Poverty Eradication as Central Issue

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 5th (Reporter Chen Ming) How to help the Asia-Pacific region eliminate poverty, protect the ecological environment of this region, and how the Asian Development Bank can play its role were the central topics discussed by representatives attending the Asian Development Bank's 22nd Annual Meeting today.

	Senior officials and financiers from 47 countries and regions expressed their views in the main venue of the meeting—the Great Wall Hotel, sharing their perspectives on the global economy, particularly the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region.

	Many representatives pointed out in their speeches that although the economic growth rate of the Asia-Pacific region is remarkable, there is still a significant imbalance in the level of economic development between developed countries and developing countries. Nearly 600 million people in the Asia-Pacific region still live in extreme poverty.

	Indonesian representative Samarin noted that this number has already surpassed the entire population of Africa. "The Asian Development Bank should make further efforts to improve the living standards of these people." The Chinese deputy representative, Qiu Qing, called on the Asian Development Bank to set the goal of eliminating poverty, adjust its loan policies, and use concessional loans for regions with concentrated poor populations.

	Some representatives from developed countries also expressed their support for the above views. British representative Christopher Patton said, "We should help the countries receiving aid to formulate plans to get rid of poverty, and at the same time, provide more investment."

	The leader of the Japanese delegation stated that Japan provided $66 million in special funds to the Asian Development Bank last year and will provide nearly $30 million in technical assistance funds this year.

	Some representatives from developing countries at the meeting called on the Asian Development Bank to actively consider increasing aid and loans for environmental protection projects in various countries, assisting member countries in taking effective protective measures, and organically combining the prevention of environmental degradation with economic development.

　　亚行年会代表展开讨论    
    消除贫困成为中心议题
    据新华社北京５月５日电  （记者陈铭）如何帮助亚太地区摆脱贫困、保护这个地区的生态环境以及亚行如何发挥自己的作用是出席亚洲开发银行理事会年会的代表们今天讨论的中心议题。
    来自４７个国家和地区的高级官员和金融家们在亚行第２２届年会的主会场——长城饭店各抒己见，阐述了对世界经济、尤其是亚太地区经济发展的看法。
    许多代表在发言中指出，尽管亚太地区的经济增长率令人瞩目，但发达国家和发展中国家之间的经济发展水平仍然存在着极大不平衡状况。亚太地区还有近６亿人口生活在赤贫之中。
    印度尼西亚理事萨马林认为，这个数字已经超过了整个非洲的人口。“亚行应进一步作出努力，提高这些人的生活水平。”亚行中国副理事邱晴则呼吁亚行以消除贫困为目标，调整贷款政策，将优惠贷款用于贫困人口集中的地区。
    一些发达国家的代表也表示赞同上述观点。英国理事克里斯托弗·帕顿说：“我们应当帮助那些得到援助的国家制定摆脱贫困的计划，同时还应提供更多的投资。”
    日本代表团团长表示，日本去年已经向亚行提供了６６００万美元的专项基金，今年还将提供近３０００万美元的技术援助专款。
    一些发展中国家的代表在会上要求亚行积极考虑增加对各国环境保护项目的援助和贷款，协助各成员国采取行之有效的保护措施，把防止自然环境恶化与经济发展有机地结合起来。
