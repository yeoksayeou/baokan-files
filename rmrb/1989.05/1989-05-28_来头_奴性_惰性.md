	The Power of Connections, Servility, and Laziness
	Yu Liang

	From the newspapers, one often sees such incidents: some "project items" clearly lack scientific basis; "official profiteers" blatantly break the law and discipline, but some people either have no choice because of their "connections" or immediately comply when they see "connections," fearing that the "connections" will blame them for disrespect.

	How do "connections" have such power? I believe there are two main reasons. On one hand, there is a lack of checks and balances on the power held by "connections," making it easy for them to abuse their power. On the other hand, some law enforcement and administrative personnel, when they see that the "connections" are too powerful to defy, bow their heads and let things pass, abandoning their duties. Such people essentially acknowledge that power is above the law.

	The harmful effects of the "power above the law" phenomenon caused by "connections" are not only in creating many servile individuals who follow "connections," but also in making many people lazy. By simply paying attention to the news and radio broadcasts, one can easily discover that some officials in various agencies and departments do not follow the law or enforce it strictly, and when faced with issues, they handle them superficially and irresponsibly, developing a lazy attitude of not doing their jobs unless there are "connections." For example, incidents such as looting forests, robbing trains, bullying the market, trafficking people, and illegal construction often drag on for a long time without being handled by the "relevant departments" according to the law. Only when there are instructions from "leaders" from departments such as the central, provincial, or county levels, do these indifferent officials start to take action. This kind of neglect of duty and reliance on "connections" to push things forward is indeed a dereliction of duty and must not be allowed to continue. Otherwise, if the mayor does not personally oversee the construction of public toilets, incidents like citizens having nowhere to relieve themselves will never end. If this continues, the law will become lawless. Many departments will fall into a semi-paralyzed state.

	Law enforcement must be strict, and officials must be responsible. This is the foundation of governance. Breaking the servility and laziness that follow "connections" is a task for the current political system reform.

### “来头”·奴性·惰性

　　“来头”　奴性　惰性
    玉良
    从报纸上经常可以看到这样的事：有些“条子工程”一眼就可以看出缺乏科学根据；“官倒”明明违法乱纪，但有的人或者因其“来头”大而无可奈何，或者一看有“来头”便赶紧照办，唯恐“来头”责其不敬。
    “来头”何以有如此威风？我看，主要有两方面原因。一方面，对“来头”握有的权力缺乏制约机制，他们在客观上很容易滥用权力；另一方面，有些执法、办事人员，一看“来头”大到难以违抗的程度，遂低头弯腰放行，放弃职守，这种人实际上承认权大于法。
    “来头”产生的权大于法效应，其危害不仅在于造出许多唯“来头”是从的奴性，而且使许多人产生惰性。只要注意看报听广播，就不难发现，一些机关、部门的执事者“有法不依”、“执法不严”，遇事敷衍塞责，养成了公事若无“来头”就不办、有了“来头”才认真的惰性。比如，哄抢山林、抢劫列车、欺行霸市、拐卖人口、违章建房之类事件，往往旷日持久得不到“有关部门”依法处理，而一旦有了“来”自诸如中央、省、县等部门“头头”的批示，这些麻木不仁的执事者才忙了起来。这种不尽职守、只靠“来头”推动的惰性，实在是一种失职行为，万万不可任凭其发展。否则，市长若不亲自抓公共厕所建设，市民无处大小便之类的事情便会没完没了地出现。长此以往，法将不法。许多部门就会处于半瘫痪状态。
    执法要严明，执事要负责，当是为政之本。而破除唯“来头”是从的奴性与惰性，则是当前政治体制改革的一项任务。
