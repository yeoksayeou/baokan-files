Li Jingyuan was born on September 19, 1909, in a peasant family in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province. In his youth, he embraced progressive ideas. In 1926, while studying at the Provincial Third Normal School, he actively participated in the student movement. In the spring of 1927, he joined the Communist Youth League. He had attended the Farmers' Association Representatives' Congress held in Nanchang.

After the August 1st Nanchang Uprising, he actively mobilized peasants to assist the uprising troops with transportation. When the uprising troops marched south, he joined the force and served as a propagandist in the Political Department of the 25th Division of the Fourth Army. In September of that year, after the Battle of Sanheba in Dapu, Guangdong, he stayed in the Dapu, Fengshun, and Meixian areas to do local work. He successively served as the secretary of the Huangjinkou District Committee of the Communist Youth League and the secretary of the East River Special Committee. Under extremely difficult conditions, he persisted in the struggle, demonstrating the firm will of a revolutionary. In the summer of 1930, he was dispatched by the East River Special Committee to deliver a message to the Central Soviet Area's Red Fourth Army Front Committee.

After 1933, he served as the political department head of the Fourth Division of the Red Third Army Corps and the political commissar of the First and Third Supplementary Divisions. During his work in the Central Soviet Area, Li Jingyuan was subjected to incorrect criticism and unfair treatment, but he endured hardships and worked actively, leading the troops in brave battles against the "encirclement and suppression."

In October 1934, Li Jingyuan participated in the famous Long March. Initially, he served as the director of the Confiscation Committee of the Central Directly Affiliated Column. After the Zunyi Conference in January 1935, he served as the director of the Political Department of the Central Directly Affiliated Column. After the Red First Front Army and the Red Fourth Front Army merged, he served as the political assistant of the Ninth Division of the Red Fourth Front Army. In the autumn of 1936, he was transferred to the Fourth Division of the Red Second Front Army to serve as the political commissar. During the Long March, Li Jingyuan worked in the First, Fourth, and Second Front Armies. He crossed the grasslands twice, endured hardships, and always maintained the unity and solidarity of the Party, supporting the correct leadership of the new Central Committee represented by Comrade Mao Zedong.

After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, Li Jingyuan served as the deputy commander and political commissar of the 358th Brigade of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army. In the autumn of 1938, the Central Committee dispatched him to lead a guerrilla unit north to Suifu, where he, together with the Mongol and Han cavalry guerrilla units, conducted guerrilla warfare in the Daqing Mountains. He served as the commander and political commissar of the unit, leading the troops in arduous and relentless struggles against the Japanese puppet forces, establishing a great reputation for the creation of the Daqing Mountains Anti-Japanese Base Area. In 1940, he was transferred back to the 358th Brigade to serve as the political commissar. In the spring of 1941, he went to the Central Party School in Yan'an for study. In the autumn of 1942, he was transferred to the Jin-Sui Border Region Joint Defense Command to serve as the secretary. In the winter of the same year, he served as the political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, training and dispatching a large number of military and political cadres for our army. Li Jingyuan made significant contributions to the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression.

After the surrender of the Japanese aggressors, Li Jingyuan served as the secretary of the Jin-Sui Branch of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the political commissar of the military region, leading the land reform movement in the Jin-Sui region. After 1948, he also served as the political commissar of the 20th Army Group. He participated in the command of the Sui-Pa battles, making important contributions to the defense of the Jin-Sui Base Area.

In the winter of 1949, Li Jingyuan served as the political commissar of the Southwestern Entry and Advance Column, participating in the leadership of the campaign to march into Southwest China. In early 1950, he served as the first secretary of the Sichuan West Area Party Committee, the political commissar of the military region, and the director of the administrative office. In the autumn of 1952, he served as the first secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, the first political commissar of the provincial military region, the chairman of the provincial government, the third vice-secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the Central Committee, and the deputy political commissar of the Southwest Military Region. During this period, Li Jingyuan led the Sichuan military and people in eliminating bandits, suppressing counter-revolutionaries, carrying out land reform, restoring the economy, and developing agricultural and industrial production, greatly promoting the development of the province's revolutionary and construction undertakings. After 1960, Li Jingyuan served as the first secretary of the Southwest Bureau of the Communist Party of China and the first political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region. He devoted his heart and soul to the various construction undertakings in Southwest China, working hard and achieving great successes.

During the "Cultural Revolution," Li Jingyuan was brutally persecuted by the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques. Despite severe physical and mental damage, he continued to fight against the Lin Biao and Jiang Qing counter-revolutionary cliques, demonstrating the firm convictions of a Communist.

Li Jingyuan was a member of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, a vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Third, Fourth, and Fifth National People's Congresses.

Li Jingyuan had long served in important leadership positions in the Party, state, and military. He had rich experience in Party building, political power building, and military building, and had a strong Party spirit and high organizational discipline. He maintained close ties with the masses, conducted in-depth investigations and research, worked diligently and conscientiously, and served the people wholeheartedly. He was upright, open-minded, and did not hide his political views. He bravely took responsibility for mistakes in his work. He was upright, principled, and considerate of the overall situation. He was honest and self-disciplined, did not seek privileges, did not pursue personal gain, and maintained the fine style and noble character of a Communist. After retiring from the front line, despite his advanced age and weak health, he studied diligently, went deep into practice, and conducted investigations and research. His life was a brilliant one, a fighting one, and a life of hard struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people and the cause of socialist construction.

Comrade Li Jingyuan will be forever remembered!
