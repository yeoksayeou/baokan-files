Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 27th.

A news photograph published on May 22nd in the first edition of the People's Daily has sparked widespread rumors. The photograph shows a vehicle resembling a tank, which has been falsely claimed to be a vehicle for storing poison gas, allegedly used to suppress students.

Today, a certain unit of the Air Force wrote to the Martial Law Command Headquarters, requesting a public refutation to clarify the truth.

The vehicle in the photograph, which resembles a tank, does not belong to the units executing martial law. It is actually a transport vehicle belonging to a certain unit of the Air Force, used for carrying anti-aircraft weapons. It is definitely not a gas vehicle. On May 15th, the unit received orders from higher authorities to dispatch five vehicles to a factory to pick up anti-aircraft weapons that had been repaired according to plan. On the 19th, while returning to their base, they encountered the same obstacles as the martial law units, which was purely coincidental. After multiple explanations to the public and clarifications of the situation, the vehicles returned to their base via a detour on the evening of the 20th.

A responsible official from the Martial Law Command Headquarters stated that the military units entering certain areas of Beijing to execute martial law are aimed at quickly stopping the turmoil, maintaining social order in the capital, and protecting the interests of the people. They are not here to suppress young students and would never carry poison gas. The official believes that the general public will not easily believe these rumors.

　　一幅新闻照片引起社会传言
    空军某部公开辟谣以正视听
    新华社北京５月２７日电  戒严指挥部消息：５月２２日，《人民日报》第一版登载了一幅新闻照片后，社会上纷纷传言，照片上一台形似罐子的车辆是储存瓦斯毒气的，是用来镇压学生的。
    今天，空军某部写信给戒严部队指挥部，要求公开辟谣，以正视听。
    照片画面上形似罐子的车辆，不属于执行戒严任务的部队，而是属于空军某部的装载防空武器的运输车，根本不是什么瓦斯车。５月１５日，空军某部接到上级通知，派出五辆车前往工厂接收按计划维修完毕的防空武器。１９日返回驻地途中，与戒严部队同时受阻，这纯属一种偶然的巧合。后经部队多次向群众解释，说明情况，于２０日晚绕道返回部队驻地。
    戒严部队指挥部负责同志说，部队到北京部分地区执行戒严任务，是为了迅速制止动乱，维护首都社会秩序，保护人民群众的利益，绝不是来镇压青年学生的，根本不可能携带瓦斯毒气，相信广大群众是不会轻信这些谣言的。
