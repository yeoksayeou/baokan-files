In recent days, people from all walks of life have been deeply concerned about the health and safety of the students who are on a hunger strike at Tiananmen Square. The parents and teachers of these students are particularly anxious. Today, a reporter visited several parents and teachers of the striking students to hear their views.

The father of Huang Jin, an 88th class finance student from Beijing Institute of Economics who has been on a hunger strike for five days, is Huang Jianxin, an engineer from Beijing Thermal Power Plant. He told the reporter, "My child has a weak constitution. My wife and I are very worried. These days, neither of us has been able to sleep at night. I hope the top leaders of the central government will come out and talk to the students as soon as possible. Today, millions of people at Tiananmen Square are supporting the striking students, which shows that the students' actions are patriotic. If the recent speeches by several central leaders have affirmed the patriotic enthusiasm of the students, why can't they agree to their reasonable demands?"

As we talked, Huang Jin's mother was already in tears beside us. She said with tears in her eyes, "A child is the flesh of his mother. How can a mother not be heartbroken? In the past two days, my husband and I have gone to the square every day, hoping to see our child, but we couldn't get in. Every time I hear the radio broadcast that more students have fainted, I think our Jin is among them. I'm about to go crazy!"

The father of Cao Yi, an 88th class finance student from Beijing Institute of Economics who is on a hunger strike, is Cao Hengzhen, a cadre of the same institute. When I entered his home, his parents had already gone to the square to visit him, leaving only his uncle, retired worker Wu Zhaoxiu. He told the reporter, "I just came back from out of town yesterday. When I heard that Xiao Yi went to the square to go on a hunger strike, my head spun. Xiao Yi's hunger strike has made his father and mother so heartbroken that they can't eat or sleep these days. I hope Xiao Yi and the others can come back home quickly, go back to school, and not ruin their health. I also hope the central leaders will agree to the children's demands and save the children."

"I think the students' actions are legitimate and patriotic. The demands of the striking students are reasonable and should be fully satisfied by the central government," said Zhu Renpu, a teacher from the Central Academy of Arts and Design.

He said, "At first, I didn't quite understand the students' movement this time. I thought they were not rational. But after going to Tiananmen Square a few times, their slogans and order really moved me. They are not only rational but also restrained. Their spirit of concern and responsibility for the future and fate of the country is worth learning from us old generation. I sincerely hope that the top leaders of the central government will come out and talk to the students immediately."

A reporter met a woman from Henan who had rushed to Tiananmen Square. Her son is a student at Peking University. She told the reporter that her son had fainted twice. She has only one child. She grabbed the reporter's hand and said, "I will definitely do a good job with my child. At the same time, I hope you can help me convey our wishes to the central government. We, the parents of the striking students, beg the central government to save our children!"

　　绝食学生家长和老师倾吐心愿    
    学生赤心爱国要求合理  希望中央领导尽快满足
    本报北京５月１７日讯  记者张锦力报道：近日来，社会各界对天安门广场上绝食同学的健康和生命安全非常担心，绝食学生的家长和老师们更是心急如焚。今天，记者走访了几位绝食学生的家长和老师，倾听了他们的意见。
    已经绝食５天的北京经济学院８８届财会专业黄进同学的父亲黄建新，是北京热电厂工程师，他对记者说：“我的孩子体质很差，我和孩子的母亲非常担心，这几天，我们俩几乎夜夜不能合眼。我希望中央主要负责人赶快出来和学生们对话。今天，天安门广场百万群众声援绝食学生，这说明，学生们的行动是爱国的。最近中央几位领导的讲话既然肯定了广大学生的爱国热情，为什么就不能答应他们的合理要求呢？”
    在我们交谈之际，黄进的母亲在一旁已经泣不成声，她含着热泪说：“孩子是母亲身上的肉，作母亲的怎能不心疼？这两天，我和孩子他爸天天去广场，想看一眼我们的孩子，可是挤不进去。每听到电视台广播又有多少学生晕倒，我就觉得小进就在里面，我都快急疯了！”
    北京经济学院财会系８８届绝食的曹毅的父亲曹恒珍是经济学院的干部，当我走进他家时，他父母已去广场探望他去了，只有他的舅舅退修老工人武兆修在家。他对记者说：我昨天刚从外地来，一听说小毅去广场绝食，我头“嗡”地一下。小毅绝食，他爸爸、妈妈这几天也心疼得吃不下饭睡不着觉。我希望小毅他们能赶快回家，赶快上学，别弄坏自己的身体，也希望中央领导答应孩子们的要求，救救孩子。
    “我觉得学生们的行动是正当的，是爱国的，绝食学生们的要求也是合理的，应该说中央是完全能够而且应该给予满足的。”中央工艺美院设计中心的朱仁普老师表明了这一看法。
    他说：“开始，我也对学生这次运动不太理解，觉得他们不理智，可是几次到天安门广场上去看后，他们的口号，他们的秩序，实在令人感动。他们不仅是理智的，而且是克制的，他们为国家前途、命运担心和负责的精神值得我们老一辈学习。我真诚地希望中央主要领导人马上出来与同学对话。”
    记者在天安门广场碰到一位从河南赶来的妇女，她的儿子是北京大学的学生，她告诉记者，她的儿子已经晕倒两次，她就一个孩子。她抓住我的手说：我一定好好做孩子工作，同时希望您能帮我向中央转达一下我们的心愿，我们这些绝食学生的家长，求求中央救救我们的孩子吧！
