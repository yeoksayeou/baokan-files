The unified market of 1992 will connect Western Europe into one, and France, located in a strategic position, has been seen by many entrepreneurs within and outside the European Community as a prime location. Apart from investing heavily in various industries in France, they are also vying to purchase everything they need there, including land, real estate, farms, forests, castles, antiques, and jewelry. According to the latest statistics, foreign direct investment in France has increased from 19 billion francs in 1986 to 32 billion francs last year. Why is foreign capital so fond of France? Apart from France's advantageous geographical location and natural conditions, it may also be because the French economy, after steady adjustments, has regained vitality and entered its best development period. In 1988, France's economic growth rate reached 3.5%, and this year it will continue to maintain this growth momentum. Last year, the employment rate increased by 1.4%. The annual inflation rate is approximately 2.7%, one of the lowest in the world.

However, the large influx of foreign capital, especially the buying spree, has caused concern among the French. Because the relentless foreign capital has brought new worries to France.

In recent years, some foreign companies and businessmen have been more eager to rush to the French countryside, buying land and farms everywhere, because the land prices there are relatively cheap. It is said that the cost of buying ten hectares of land in the Netherlands can buy sixty hectares of land in France. Thus, many "adventurers" have bought dairy farms, horse farms, forest hunting grounds, biological agricultural experimental sites, vineyards, ancient castles, and country villas in France, and then some have turned them into entertainment or tourist spots. This way, the amount of land sold in the French countryside is increasing day by day. In just a few years, nearly 20,000 hectares of land have changed hands. The French are worried that if this "green invasion" continues, it will lead to the decline of French agriculture.

The construction of the Channel Tunnel, connecting the British Isles with the European mainland, has made the French increasingly worried. In the past few months, more than 200 country villas in Normandy and Brittany have fallen into the hands of the British.

The capital Paris is even more of a "treasure trove" for people. It is said that the "heritage" bought by foreigners each year is equivalent to 10% of the entire annual commercial sales of Paris. Unlike the French countryside, the real estate and land prices in Paris are exorbitantly high. For example, the selling price of three buildings on Avenue Albert-Marcel is as high as 70,000 francs per square meter. Despite this, the rich from the United States, Japan, and other countries are still flocking to buy. In 1987, a Japanese consortium bought 70,000 square meters of office buildings in a certain area of Paris for 2.8 billion francs in one go. With the acceleration of the buying activities, in the past three years, Japan has increased its industry in France by 27 times. In this way, foreign tycoons have taken root in Paris, and 20% of the offices there have become their real estate.

In this buying frenzy, foreign merchants, of course, will not miss out on France's cultural relics and treasures. It is said that in 1987, the Japanese alone bought about 3 billion francs worth of paintings and antiques.

It is worth mentioning that the Japanese are buying in the "Golden Triangle," namely the 1st, 8th, and 16th districts of Paris. Due to the large number of Japanese tourists to Paris, some Japanese businessmen tried to establish a "base" for Japanese people to enjoy near Paris. They bought almost all the golf courses near Paris to satisfy the wishes of ordinary Japanese people that are difficult to realize in their homeland. In addition, they bought a large number of two-star small hotels, while preserving their exteriors, they renovated the interiors according to Japanese standards, and then rented them out at high prices in secret, making a fortune. This way, they can avoid building permits and thus avoid taxes. The clever tactics of the Japanese step by step advancing towards the center of Paris indeed make the French people frightened.

In fact, this buying spree is aimed at 1992. This makes the French even more worried, fearing being "colonized." The French Ministry of Industry said that the French economy is more fragile compared to other industrialized countries. After the establishment of the unified market in 1992, "French enterprises will face serious difficulties because they lack sufficient competitiveness, and their tax burden is particularly heavy."

It seems that the key is to formulate a more perfect foreign development strategy and enhance the competitiveness of enterprises. Otherwise, even if all efforts are made to defend the franc, it may not be able to win in the increasingly fierce competition in the future.

### 外资购买风冲击法国

　　外资购买风冲击法国
    顾玉清
    一九九二年的统一大市场将把西欧连成一片，地处“要塞”的法国，已被欧共体内外的许多企业家视为立足的宝地。他们除了在法国各行各业大量投资外，还在那里争相购买自己所需要的一切，其中包括土地、房产、农场、森林、城堡、古董和珠宝等。据最新统计，外国人在法国的直接投资已从一九八六年的一百九十亿法郎增至去年的三百二十亿法郎。外资为何对法国如此青睐？除了法国得天独厚的地理位置和自然条件外，也许还因法国经济经过稳步调整已恢复活力，进入了最好的发展时期。一九八八年法国经济增长率达到百分之三点五，今年将继续保持增长势头。去年的就业率增长了百分之一点四。年通货膨胀率约为百分之二点七，属于世界上最低之列。
    然而，外资大量进入法国，特别是掀起购买风潮，不能不令法国人忧心忡忡。因为咄咄逼人的外资已给法国带来不少新的忧患。
    近年来，一些外国公司和商人更乐于涌向法国农村，到处寻购土地和农场，因为那里的地价相对便宜。据说在荷兰仅能买十公顷土地的费用，在法国可以买到六十公顷土地。于是乎，不少“探险者”在法兰西买下了奶牛场、养马场、森林猎场、生物农业试验地、葡萄园、古堡庄园以及乡间别墅等，然后有的再把它们改造成为娱乐或旅游场所。这样，法国农村被卖的土地不断增加，短短的几年中，已有近二万公顷土地易主。法国人担心，这种“绿色的入侵”发展下去，会导致法国农业的衰落。
    英吉利海底隧道的修建，将英伦三岛与欧洲大陆相连，使法国人越来越感到担心。在以往几个月里诺曼底和布列塔尼已有二百多座乡间别墅落入英国人之手。
    首都巴黎更是人们垂涎的“宝山”。据说，每年被外国人买去的“遗产”相当于整个巴黎全年商业销售额的百分之十。与法国农村截然不同的是，巴黎的房产、地价贵得出奇。如阿尔贝里克·马夏尔大街的三座大厦，每平方米售价高达七万法郎。尽管如此，美国、日本等国的巨富们仍然趋之若鹜。一九八七年，日本一个财团一次就以二百八十亿法郎买下巴黎某地区七万平方米的办公大楼。随着购买活动的加速，最近三年，日本已使它在法国的产业增加了二十七倍。就这样，外国大亨们在巴黎扎了根，那里百分之二十的办公室已成为他们的不动产。
    在这股购买的狂潮中，外商们当然不会放过法国的文物珍宝。据说，一九八七年，仅日本人就购买了约三十亿法郎的字画和古董。
    值得一提的是，日本人在“金三角”，即巴黎的一区、八区和十六区的购买行动。由于日本人到巴黎旅游的人大量增加，一些日商试图在巴黎附近建立一个供日本人游乐的“根据地”。他们买下了巴黎附近几乎所有的高尔夫球场，以满足一般日本人在本土难以实现的愿望。另外，他们大量购买两星级小旅馆，在保留其外表的情况下，按照日本标准拆修内部，然后私下高价出租，大发横财。这样做可免领建房许可证，也就无需纳税了。日本人步步向巴黎中心进逼的这些精明作法，确实使法国人望而生畏。
    事实上，这次购买风是冲着一九九二年刮起来的。这就更令法国人担忧，生怕被“殖民化”。法国工业部说法国经济比起其他工业化国家来显得脆弱，一九九二年建立统一大市场后，“法国企业将会遇到严重困难，因为它缺乏足够的竞争力，而且它的税收负担又特别重”。
    看来，关键在于制定一项较为完善的对外发展战略，增强企业的竞争能力。否则，即使组织一切法郎上“前线”，也未必能在未来日趋激烈的较量中取胜。
