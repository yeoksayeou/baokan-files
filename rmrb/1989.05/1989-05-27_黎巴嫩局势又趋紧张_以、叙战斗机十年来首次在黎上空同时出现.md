Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 26th.

As Arab leaders in Casablanca strive to find a solution to the Lebanese crisis, the war-torn situation in Lebanon has once again become tense.

Israeli and Syrian fighter jets appeared in Lebanese skies for the first time in a decade. At the same time, Syrian and Lebanese Christian militias exchanged fire across the Green Line in Beirut, with no reports of casualties so far.

According to reports from Israel, Syria is deploying a tank brigade and a helicopter-borne assault unit to reinforce its 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon. The reports indicate that the Israeli cabinet discussed Syria's military movements and ordered the military to closely monitor Syrian actions.

Israeli F-16 reconnaissance aircraft conducted surveillance over southern Lebanon and some refugee camps on the morning of the 26th. Syrian aircraft also flew over Beirut and the bases of the Christian militias on the same morning. In the previous few days, Syrian aircraft had flown over northern Lebanon three times.
