The Guangzhou Maritime Court recently issued an order to detain the British-registered Panamanian ship "Kuli" in Haikou Port for carrying spoiled flour.

Local newspapers reported that in mid-April, the "Kuli" ship arrived in Haikou Port carrying nearly 6,000 tons of flour. After inspection by the Haikou Health and Quarantine Station, it was found that a significant portion of the flour had damaged packaging, was moldy, and clumped together, making it unfit for consumption. The three purchasing companies, Hong Kong Hua Lian (Hainan) Technology Development Company, Hainan Zhongdao Group Grain and Oil Food Trade Company, and Wenchang County Zhenwen Trading Company, filed a lawsuit with the Guangzhou Maritime Court, demanding compensation from the shipowner and a deposit of $1.7 million. The case is still under trial.

    英一货轮在海口港被扣
    据新华社海口５月１８日电  广州海事法院最近发下船舶扣押令，将承运变质面粉的英国巴拿马籍“库里”货轮扣押在海口港。
    此间报纸报道说，４月中旬，“库里”轮运载近６０００吨面粉抵达海口港。经海口卫生防疫站检验，发现这批面粉有相当部分包装破损，面粉发霉结块，不能食用。香港华联（海南）技术开发公司、海南中岛集团粮油食品工贸公司、文昌县振文贸易公司等三家购货单位向广州海事法院上诉，要求船方赔偿，承受担保金１７０万美元。此案正在继续审理中。
