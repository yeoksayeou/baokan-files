Beijing Daily Editorial Department:

We are middle-aged intellectuals and Communist Party members working in Beijing. We are deeply concerned about the current situation in the city and wish to express our views to the people of Beijing through the city's official newspaper.

Over the past month, some university students in the capital, driven by their love for the country and desire for democracy, have been sitting in protest and petitioning at Tiananmen Square. Some have even resorted to extreme measures such as hunger strikes. We must honestly say that we do not approve of these methods. However, as a generation that has experienced the trials of the Cultural Revolution, we can understand the feelings of our younger siblings. Now, this student movement has lasted for over 30 days, and its continuation is worrying.

How did the situation deteriorate to this point? Future time and practice will provide the correct answers. For now, the overriding concern is to stabilize the situation and prevent further deterioration from the perspective of the highest interests of the Party, the state, and the people of the nation. We need to calm down and return to solving problems within the framework of the law and democracy.

The urgent issue that needs to be addressed is the chaos that has already occurred and is spreading from Beijing to the rest of the country. This chaos seriously disrupts social production and life order, causing concern and anxiety among all good-hearted people. History, both domestic and foreign, has taught us that chaos under anarchy will inevitably lead to a full-scale turmoil. The disastrous consequences of such turmoil will not be limited to the Party and the government; the first victims will be the broad masses of the people, including the young students.

We, who have come out of the hell of the Cultural Revolution, still have a painful and clear memory of how, during those ten years of turmoil, from the Chairman of the Republic to the common people, everyone lost their basic human rights; the national economy was on the brink of collapse; people's lives did not improve for a long time; the Party had no peace, the country had no peace, and the heavens had no peace. In that turmoil, instigated by a handful of scheming and conspiratorial opportunists, how many excellent young people, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao," met a tragic and yet confused end, sacrificing their precious lives in vain! How many generations were wasted in those ten wasted years!

We appeal to our fellow citizens, who lost family members, wasted their youth, and suffered greatly in the bloodshed and turmoil of the past ten years, to take on historical and social responsibility; to advise their children and relatives to stay calm and rational, and not to let history repeat its tragedy!

We must calmly recognize that establishing and perfecting socialist legal systems is a historical process; the development of democracy must proceed in tandem with the establishment of legal systems. Democracy without legal systems can only lead to an anarchic state. Similarly, the development of democracy must be compatible with economic development. It is naive to expect that a healthy democracy and legal system can be achieved overnight in our country, which, though full of hope, is currently poor, backward, and educationally underdeveloped.

All compatriots who truly care about the future of the country and the nation should, with a high sense of responsibility towards history and the people, assess the situation and engage in persistent struggle; rather than using irresponsible impulsiveness and inflammatory rhetoric to promote an unhealthy democratic utopian sentiment, and participating in activities that can only lead to turmoil. We must prudently recognize that building a prosperous and strong China may take a hundred years, but destroying a promising China can be done in a day!

Young friends, compatriots, think carefully!

### 七名中年知识分子的信

　　七名中年知识分子的信北京日报编辑部：
    我们是在京工作的中年知识分子、共产党员，对本市当前形势十分不安，想通过市委机关报向全市人民谈谈我们的看法。
    一个月来，首都部分大学生怀着爱国家、求民主的初衷，在天安门静坐、请愿，甚至一度采取了激烈的绝食手段。对此种方式，坦率地说，我们是不赞成的。然而，作为一代历经“文化大革命”磨难的老大学生，我们可以理解弟弟妹妹的心情。现在，这场学潮已持续了３０多天，拖下去令人担忧。
    事态是如何恶化到今天这种地步的？今后的时间和实践会得出正确的结论；眼下压倒一切的大局是从党和国家及全国人民的最高利益出发，稳定局面，控制事态的进一步恶化；冷静下来，回到法制和民主的轨道上解决问题。
    刻不容缓需要解决的现状是：这场已经出现的混乱，正在从北京向全国蔓延。它严重地干扰了社会生产和生活秩序，引起了一切善良人们的不安和焦虑。中外历史沉痛地告诉我们：无政府状态下的混乱，必将导致一场全面的动乱。而动乱带来的灾难性恶果，就绝不仅限于党和政府承受，首当其冲的直接受害者是广大的人民群众，包括青年学生。
    我们这些从“文革”炼狱中走出来的一代中年人，都还痛苦而清晰地记忆着：在那无法无天的十年动乱中，从共和国主席到“平民百姓”都毫无例外地丧失了基本人权；国民经济濒临崩溃；人民生活长期得不到改善；党无宁日，国无宁日，天无宁日。而就在那场被一小撮别有用心的野心家、阴谋家煽动起来的无政府主义动乱中，有多少优秀的青年呼喊着“毛主席万岁”的口号，悲壮、然而又糊涂地无谓献出了自己宝贵的生命；又有几代人被白白耽误了十载宝贵的年华！
    我们呼吁：在十年浩劫的血雨腥风中失去亲人、耽误青春、受尽苦难的同胞们，拿出历史责任心和社会责任感；告诫自己的子弟和亲人，保持冷静和理智，不要使历史的悲剧重演！
    必须冷静地看到：建立和健全社会主义法制，只能是一个历史的过程；民主的发展必须与法制的健全同步进行；没有法制的民主只能导致无政府主义的状态。同样，民主的发展，又必须与经济的发展相适应。不能天真地幻想：健全的民主和法制，在我们这个虽大有希望，然而目前仍处在贫穷、落后、教育尚不发达的国家，会一个早上实现。
    一切真正关心国家、民族前途的同胞，都应以对历史、对人民高度负责的态度，审时度势，进行坚韧的战斗；而不要用不负责任的冲动和过激的词藻去渲染一种不健康的民主乌托邦情绪，参与那些最后只能导致动乱的活动。必须审慎地看到：建设一个繁荣富强的中国一百年也许不多，而毁掉一个大有希望的中国一天就足够了！
    青年朋友们、同胞们，三思啊！
