An ancient cypress tree
It seems to have a pair of gloves. At noon, when people are resting, it puts on the gloves to catch the shadows, birds, clouds, and the wind that passes by.
It also has a pocket.
It wraps the moon with white clouds, then puts it in its pocket, when people and chicks are resting at night.

A white rhododendron tree

One
(It blooms with snow-white flowers.)
On a desolate winter day, the hills are adorned with snow, covering the thatched village houses, the fences of the private plots, and the withered grass growing on rocks, village paths, and small trails. Later, the snow melts, and the snow water seeps into the soil of the hill where it stands...
It drinks the snow water preserved deep within the hill every day: pure and white poetry.

Two
(It blooms with snow-white flowers,
Do you know—),
It watches the still clouds in the sky and the moving clouds; sometimes it also watches the mist flowing between the mountains;
It often asks the sun questions; lets the sun answer its doubts;
It also listens to the sounds coming from the village stream;
Its heart is filled with various emotions flowing in natural scenery and its own naive understanding and doubts about nature. It blooms with snow-white flowers.

(Note) In the 1970s, my family and I lived in this small mountain village with only three households. I used to tell this story, which I wrote myself, to my children.

　　杉坊村
    郭风
    一棵古柏
    它好像有一双手套。在中午人们休息的时候，把手套套在双手上，去捉日影、鸟、云和吹过的风。
    它还有一个口袋。
    它用白云把月亮包了一下，然后放在口袋里，在夜间人们休息的时候，在雏鸟睡眠时。
    　　　　一棵白杜鹃树
    　　　　一
    （它开放雪白的鲜花。）
    荒凉的冬日，由雪来装饰丘岗，盖着茅草的村舍，自留地的篱笆，长在岩石、村路和小径上的衰草；后来雪融化了，雪水注入它站立的丘岗的泥土中去……
    它天天饮下丘岗深层里保存的雪水：纯洁和白色的诗情。
    　　　　二
    （它开放雪白的鲜花，
    你们知道么——），
    它观看空中不动的云，和流动的云；有时也观看山间流动的雾；
    时常向太阳询问；让太阳回答它的疑问；
    它也听村中溪水传来的声音；
    它的心中有种种在自然景象中流动的情意以及它自己对于自然的天真的理解和疑惑。它开放雪白的鲜花。
    （注）７０年代，我举家旅居于这座只有３户的小山村。这首散文诗，我当时曾作为一个自编的故事，说给儿女听。
