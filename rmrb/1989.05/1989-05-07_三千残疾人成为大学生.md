Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 7th.

	Three thousand five hundred disabled students are currently enrolled in Chinese universities, and this year, over eight hundred disabled college students will graduate and be assigned jobs.

	It is reported that in 1985, relevant state departments issued a regulation: as long as a candidate can take care of themselves and meets the admission score, they cannot be rejected from a suitable major due to their disability. Over the past four years, in addition to regular universities enrolling disabled college students, there are also two universities nationwide that have specially established departments for the disabled.

　　三千残疾人成为大学生
    新华社北京五月七日电  （实习生杨兴国）中国残疾人联合会新近提供的数据表明，我国目前高校在册残疾大学生达三千五百多名，今年有八百多名残疾大学生即将毕业分配。
    据介绍，一九八五年，国家有关部门作出规定：凡生活能够自理，达到录取分数线的，不能因考生残疾而不录取适宜的专业。四年来，除普通高校招收残疾人大学生外，全国还有两所大学专门设置了残疾人系（部）。
