A simple, practical, and cost-effective method for treating paper mill wastewater has recently undergone a successful pilot-scale test in Chengdu and received positive feedback from relevant experts.

Paper mill wastewater is one of the major sources of pollution in China. Currently, there are approximately 9,000 paper mills nationwide, discharging about 3.9 billion tons of wastewater annually, which accounts for 1/6 of the total industrial wastewater discharged in the country. The new physical-chemical coagulation process, jointly developed by the Sichuan Provincial Materials Exchange Information Center's Applied Technology Research Institute and the Sichuan Deyang Water Treatment Engineering Company, requires less capital investment, occupies less land, and has lower operating costs.

　　治理造纸废水有新法
    本报成都５月１０日电  记者罗茂城报道：一种简便、实用、成本较低的治理造纸废水的物理化学凝聚法日前在成都通过中试鉴定，获得有关专家的好评。
    造纸废水是我国主要污染源之一。全国目前约有造纸企业９０００个，年排放废水约３９亿吨，占全国工业废水排放总量的１／６。由四川省物资交易信息中心应用技术研究所和四川德阳水处理工程公司共同研制的物理化学凝聚法新工艺，基建投资省、占地少、运行费用低。
