    Beijing Smashes the So-Called "Flying Tiger Squad" Motorcycle Gang
    11 Ringleaders Detained for Investigation

    According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Beijing on May 30, a motorcycle gang known as the "Flying Tiger Squad" that had been disrupting the normal social order of the capital has been dismantled. Eleven ringleaders have been detained by the public security authorities for investigation.

    It is understood that this motorcycle gang began appearing on the streets of Beijing on May 15. The gang, flying banners such as "Iron Horse Guard" and "Flying Tiger Squad," would ride in groups ranging from dozens to several hundred, recklessly speeding through the streets and disrupting the social order of the capital.

    Preliminary investigations by the public security authorities reveal that these individuals were shouting slogans to incite the public and distributing leaflets, spreading rumors of "the military suppressing students" to mislead the people. This motorcycle gang would speed through the streets, causing motor vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians to scatter in panic. On May 22, they shouted slogans such as "to the fake government" and rushed into the south entrance of Justice Road, stopping on the street in front of the municipal government building and shouting wildly. These individuals often emerged at night, loudly shouting "Citizens, don't sleep, wake up," causing great fear among the people.

    They also stormed factories and intercepted military vehicles. On May 20, over a hundred motorcycles rode to the eastern gate of the Capital Steel Works, inciting the workers to go on strike, even entering the factory (and were detained). Whenever they heard about military vehicles from the martial law troops, they would immediately rush over. In Fengtai's Liuqiao and Daxing County's Huangcun, they surrounded military vehicles and threw stones and bottles at the PLA soldiers. In Daxing County, they attacked the public security authorities, smashing the traffic police office. They stormed gas stations, openly stealing oil or forcibly refueling.

    Preliminary investigations show that the key instigators in the motorcycle gang mainly consist of three types of people: first, individuals released from prison or re-education through labor; second, hoodlums; third, idle individuals and self-employed workers. Most of these people have expressed that they will no longer engage in such activities.

    北京摧垮号称“飞虎队”的摩托车队
    11名带头闹事分子被拘留审查
    据新华社北京5月30日电  据北京市公安局负责人介绍：一支扰乱首都正常社会秩序的号称“飞虎队”的“摩托车队”组织已被摧垮，其中11名带头闹事者已被公安机关拘留审查。
    据了解，这支“摩托车队”是从5月15日开始在北京街头出现的。这个车队打着“铁骑卫队”、“飞虎队”等旗子，少则几十辆，多则三四百辆，成群结队地横冲直撞，扰乱了首都的社会秩序。
    经公安机关初步审查，这些人四处呼喊煽动人心的口号，并散发传单，造谣“军队镇压学生”以蛊惑人心。这支
  “摩托车队”在大街上超速行驶，机动车、自行车和行人无不惊慌躲避。5月22日他们叫嚣“到伪政府去”，闯入正义路南口，停在市政府门前的马路上狂喊乱叫。这些人往往在深夜窜出，大声地叫嚷“市民们别睡了，快起来呀”，使群众深受惊吓之苦。
    他们还冲击工厂，拦截军车。5月20日，百余辆摩托车开到首钢东大门附近，煽动首钢工人罢工，甚至冲入厂内
  （被扣留）。他们一听哪里有戒严部队的军车，马上就分拨赶去。在丰台六里桥、大兴县黄村，他们围着军车，朝解放军战士扔石头和汽水瓶。在大兴县，他们围攻公安机关，砸交通队办公室。他们冲闯汽车加油站，公然抢油或强行加油。
    从初步审查情况看，摩托车队中起哄捣乱的骨干分子主要有三种人：一是刑满释放、解除劳教的人员；二是流里流气的痞子；三是闲散人员和个体从业者。这伙人中的大部分人已表示不再干这类活动了。
