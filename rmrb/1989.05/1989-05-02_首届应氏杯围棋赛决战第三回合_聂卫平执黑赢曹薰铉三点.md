The first Yingshi Cup Go tournament third-round match was held today in Seoul. Cho Hun-hyun, a 9-dan player, lost again to Nie Weiping, making the overall score 1-2. Cho will face Nie in the fourth round under the double pressure of playing with black and having to make up an 8-point deficit.

The match today consisted of 263 moves and ended at 5:20 PM. Nie used 2 hours and 41 minutes, while Cho used the full 3 hours and an additional 20 minutes under the time pressure. The remaining matches' schedule is yet to be determined, but the location is likely to be Taipei or Singapore.

Nie's black pieces ultimately defeated Cho's white pieces by three points. As the players themselves put it, today's match was a "hard-fought game." The black and white pieces appeared stable, but each side was filled with internal strength, constantly restraining the opponent while fiercely competing for territory. It can be said that both players had started the endgame by the 20th move, and even after more than 100 moves, near the end, both still had chances to win. After the match, Nie said he felt "very tired," and Cho said, "It was a very tough game."

After the black "star-small target" and white "two-star" opening, Nie Weiping hung low on both of Cho's corners, fighting for real estate. Both sides followed the standard sequence, each gaining something. By white's 26th move, Cho inserted a stone into the black's territory, and the two colors came into contact, starting the first and only battle. After 30 minutes of deep thought, Cho decided to start a fight with moves 32 and 34. However, this fight did not escalate further, and soon Nie resolved the fight, making the path to victory long again.

At 1:00 PM, the game resumed from white's 46th move, still difficult to distinguish between the two sides. By black's 141st move, Nie split a block of white stones that had not yet been alive and used the attack on this block of stones to establish his own powerful external influence. Some high-level spectators thought that Nie Weiping had a slight advantage and had a chance to win. However, turning the advantage into a win was extremely difficult. Only after black took the 171st long move and dropped a small white space at the 185th "point" did the victory become certain. A high-level player thought that if Cho Hun-hyun had seen this move, the victory and defeat might have changed at the last moment.

Cho Hun-hyun had said before coming to Ningbo that this match was a crucial game, and whoever won would likely win the cup. Today, despite his strong momentum, even smashing a jade chess piece (on the 56th move), he still could not defeat Nie Weiping.

### 首届应氏杯围棋赛决战第三回合  聂卫平执黑赢曹薰铉三点

　　首届应氏杯围棋赛决战第三回合    
    聂卫平执黑赢曹薰铉三点
    本报宁波５月２日电  记者温子建报道：汉城的曹薰铉九段今天在与聂卫平进行应氏杯围棋赛第三回合的决战中再度告负，使总比分成为１∶２。他将在执黑贴还８点和背水一战的双重压力下进行第４个回合的较量。
    今天这盘棋共弈了２６３手，下午５点２０分结束，聂卫平用时２小时４１分，曹薰铉在用光３小时规定时间后又在读秒声中下了２０分钟的棋。至此，聂曹二人的决战暂告一段落，后面的比赛时间尚未确定，地点则很可能放到台北或者新加坡。
    聂卫平的黑棋最后胜曹薰铉的白棋３点。按照棋手们的话来说，今天两人下了一盘“功夫棋”，黑白子形势看似平稳，实际上却各自蕴含内力，在制约对手的同时锱铢必较地争夺地盘。可以说，双方刚刚弈至２０几手棋时就已经开始收官子，而在一百多手、临近结束时仍各有取胜的机会。比赛结束后，聂九段觉得“非常累”，曹九段说“下得很艰苦”。
    黑棋的“星·小目”、白棋“二连星”开局后，聂卫平连续低挂对方两角，争抢实地，双方依定式演变，各有所得。到了白２６手，曹拈子点入黑势力范围，两色棋子接触，展开首次也是唯一的一次战斗。曹九段经过３０多分钟的长考后，于３２、３４手做劫毅然挑起纷争。但是这个劫争并未进一步激烈下去，不久聂九段消弥了劫争，胜负道路再次漫长起来。
    下午一点，从白４６手开始续弈，依然难分优劣。到１４１手黑分断了一块未活白棋，并借攻击这块棋建立了自己强大的外势时，一些观战高手认为聂卫平已经略略占优，取胜有望。不过把优势转为胜势是极为困难的，直到黑抢到１７１位的长出，并在１８５“点”掉白棋一块小空后，才彻底确立了胜势。一位高段棋手认为，如果这时曹薰铉看到这一着法，胜负则极有可能在最后一刻互易。
    曹薰铉到宁波后曾表示，这盘棋是关键的比赛，谁获胜将很可能最后捧杯，今天他尽管气势很足，甚至拍碎了一枚玉石棋子（第５６手），仍然未能战胜聂卫平。
