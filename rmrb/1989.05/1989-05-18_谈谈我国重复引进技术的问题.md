Recently, various news media have reported that the nationwide "canned drink import craze" is spreading further; magnetic tape and disk production lines are being imported en masse; and there is also severe over-importation of washing machine, refrigerator, and suit production lines beyond domestic market demand. These signs indicate that China's technology imports and equipment purchases have become somewhat out of control at the macro level, and low-efficiency duplicated imports need to be stopped urgently.

To limit duplicated imports, we must use efficiency as the standard, differentiate between situations, and handle them accordingly. Based on the current situation, the focus of limiting duplicated imports should be on duplicated equipment imports (especially large-scale equipment and production lines with high foreign exchange usage) and regional duplicated imports. However, for some software duplicated imports and some competitive duplicated imports, specific analyses should be conducted to determine strategies.

Currently, the speed of global scientific and technological development is accelerating, and the technology update cycle is shortening. To adapt to this trend, objectively, China needs to maintain a reasonable continuity in technology imports, gradually introduce higher-level technologies on the basis of digesting and absorbing previously imported technologies, and adopt a "step-by-step" import method. Domestic and international practices have shown that continuous software duplicated imports of this technological update type not only help enterprises quickly master contemporary advanced technologies worldwide and timely transform them into productive forces but also save a large amount of research and development costs, ultimately achieving relatively ideal micro and macro benefits. Therefore, for technological update-type software duplicated imports, we should start from the perspective of benefits and provide reasonable guidance and support.

Equipment imports are capital-intensive, and if duplicated imports occur, the losses will undoubtedly be significant. Therefore, equipment duplicated imports should be avoided as much as possible. For technologies and equipment that have already been imported and realized domestically, re-importation is strictly prohibited; for key equipment that is urgently needed in production but cannot be developed domestically for the time being, imports should be moderate, and relevant departments and enterprises should be promptly issued with mandatory domesticization deployment and indicators, and imports should not be endless.

From a national perspective, regional duplicated imports have significant blind spots and are not conducive to the rational layout of the national economy and the effective macro allocation of resources, and efforts should be made to limit them. For technology imports in various regions, the state should make overall planning from a macro perspective, based on the technical demand status, economic geography, and existing technical digestion and absorption capabilities of each region, and achieve the best layout according to the requirements of scale economy. Whether it is a long-term or short-term technology import project, it should be reasonably guided and adjusted according to changes in quantity. Currently, it is particularly important to comprehensively use tax, credit, regulations, and administrative approval measures to limit long-term projects while also limiting the short-term behavior of various regions focusing solely on certain short-term projects in the consumer sector.

Enterprises in the same market may sequentially import the same type of technology to gain a competitive advantage, and compete to digest, absorb, and improve the imported technology. Reasonably guiding and controlling this type of competitive duplicated import will help enterprises engage in healthy competition, overcome technological monopolies, and promote technological progress. For competitive duplicated imports of projects where the foreign party restricts free transfer in the technology import contract and market demand far exceeds supply, they should generally be allowed. However, for competitive duplicated imports that do not meet the national economic layout and scale economy requirements, they should be limited.

The state has already formulated and implemented some policies and regulations to stop unreasonable duplicated imports. However, why do they keep happening? The main reasons are:

(1) After the central and local governments implemented the "separate budget" system, it mobilized the enthusiasm of local governments to revitalize the economy, but it also exacerbated local protectionism. Some local governments, departments, and enterprises only care about short-term and local benefits, expanding investments in temporarily high-profit projects, and generally, the short-term benefits of converting imported technologies and equipment into productive forces are high, thus triggering this type of technology and equipment duplicated imports, especially the duplicated imports of high-profit consumer goods production lines.

(2) Under the conditions of distorted prices and an imperfect market mechanism, we cannot fully leverage the role of economic levers to effectively guide technology imports and equipment purchase investments to key sectors and industries of the national economy. Instead, under the distorted price incentives, funds have flowed into generally processed industries and consumer goods industries with excessively high profits.

(3) The information management link is weak. Some regions, departments, and enterprises, to protect their local interests, mutually block import information. Macroscopically, there is a lack of strong guidance and coordination, and the information management methods are relatively backward. The published relevant import information is incomplete, untimely, and even erroneous.

(4) There are loopholes in macro control. For example, in the past, major technology equipment imports were subject to "unified approval and centralized management," but imports through joint ventures were excluded. As a result, duplicated imports in this field have not been properly restricted.

In addition, in some departments and regions organizing technology import projects below the central approval limit, there has been a lack of attention to specialization and serialization, and the relationship between imports and central plans, departmental plans, and regional plans has not been properly handled, resulting in a certain degree of blindness.

Given the current shortage of foreign exchange in China, to truly achieve the goal of using good steel on the blade and improving the macro comprehensive benefits of technology import investments, we must work hard and focus on strictly limiting duplicated imports. To this end, the following aspects of work should be done:

- Optimize the approval system, changing the current single quota control by the state to dual control of quota and scale. That is, technology import projects above the quota continue to be approved by the central government; projects below the quota, based on the specific situation of each region, are uniformly planned by the central government to determine the import scale of each department and region, which shall not be exceeded. On this basis, each department and region approves projects below the quota.

- Improve macro control. The key to limiting duplicated imports is whether the relevant control departments have new measures. Simply reusing the old method of strengthening macro control by concentrating power is obviously not feasible. In addition to plugging loopholes in the approval system, the more important thing is to fully leverage the role of economic levers such as taxes, credit, and prices, and through improving economic regulations, effectively limit duplicated imports.

- Change the single short-term economic benefit assessment index of the state on the technology imports of departments, regions, and enterprises to multiple assessment indices such as short-term economic benefits, long-term economic benefits, equipment utilization rate, and fund occupation rate, to force departments, regions, and enterprises to truly focus on long-term economic benefits.

- Improve the technology import information management system. The state should establish a unified technology import information database management system, conduct necessary information censuses and registrations of existing technology imports, and on this basis, establish a technology import registration system and timely release relevant information to society.

　　谈谈我国重复引进技术的问题
    杨爱群
    最近一个时期以来，各种新闻媒介相继披露：全国性的“易拉罐引进热”有进一步蔓延之势；磁带磁盘生产线引进一哄而起；还有洗衣机、电冰箱、西服生产线引进已严重超出国内市场所求……种种迹象表明，我国的技术引进和设备进口已发生一定程度的宏观失控，低效益的重复引进亟待制止。
    限制重复引进，一定要以效益为标准，分清情况，区别对待。根据当前的实际情况，限制重复引进的重点应放在设备重复进口（尤其是用汇量大的大型成套设备和成套生产线的重复进口）和地区重复引进上。而对某些软件的重复引进和某些竞争型重复引进，则要具体分析，确定对策。
    当前，世界科技发展速度日益加快，科技更新周期日益缩短。为了适应这一发展趋势，客观上要求我国在技术引进中，保持合理的连续性，在消化、吸收原有引进技术的基础上，再采取“阶梯式”的引进方式，循序渐进地引进更高层次的技术。国内外的实践表明，属于这种技术更新型的连续性的软技术重复引进，不仅有利于企业迅速掌握世界当代先进技术，及时转化为生产力，而且可以节省大量研究开发费用，最终取得较为理想的微观效益和宏观效益。因此，对于技术更新型的软件重复引进，要从效益的角度出发，给予合理的引导和支持。
    设备进口耗资大，如发生重复进口的话，无疑损失也大。因此，要尽量避免设备重复进口。凡是国内已经进口并实现了国产化的技术设备，决不允许再进口；凡是国内目前一时尚研制不出而生产上又急需的关键设备，进口也要适度，而且还要对有关部门和企业及时地下达国产化的硬性部署和指标，切不可无休止地进口。
    从全国来讲，地区重复引进带有很大的盲目性，不利于全国经济的合理布局和资源的有效宏观配置，要努力限制。对于各地的技术引进，国家应从宏观上做好统筹安排，根据各地的技术需求状况、经济地理条件、现有技术消化吸收能力，按照规模经济的要求，实现最佳布局。无论是技术引进的长线项目还是短线项目，都应根据量的变化，适时合理引导和调整投资。当前，尤其要综合运用税收、信贷、法规和行政审批手段，在限制长线项目的同时，也要限制各地一味上消费领域的某些短线项目的短期行为。
    处于同一市场上的同类企业，为了取得市场竞争的有利地位，有时会相继引进同类技术，并竞相消化、吸收和改进引进技术。这种竞争型的重复引进，对其加以合理的引导和控制，将有利于企业之间开展良性竞争，克服技术垄断行为，推动企业技术进步。对于技术引进合同中外方规定不许自由转让的，以及市场需求远远大于供给的项目的竞争型重复引进，原则上应该允许。但是，对于不符合全国经济布局和规模经济要求的竞争型重复引进，则应限制。
    制止不合理的重复引进，国家已经制定并实施了一些政策和规定。但为什么屡禁不止呢？究其原因，主要是：（一）中央、地方财政实行“分灶吃饭”后，调动了地方振兴经济的积极性，但也助长了地方本位主义抬头。一些地方、部门和企业只顾眼前效益和局部效益，纷纷扩大一时高盈利项目的投资，而靠引进技术、进口设备转化生产力，一般眼前效益都较高，因而引发了这一类技术和设备的重复引进，尤其是盈利很高的消费品生产线的重复引进。
    （二）在价格扭曲、市场机制不健全的条件下，我们难以充分发挥经济杠杆的作用，有效引导技术引进和设备进口投资流向国民经济发展的关键部门和行业，相反，在扭曲的价格诱导下，资金大量涌入盈利过高的一般加工工业和消费品工业。
    （三）信息管理环节薄弱。一些地区、部门和企业为了维护自身局部利益，互相封锁引进信息，对此，宏观上缺乏有力的指导和协调，信息管理手段也较为落后，公布的有关引进信息不全面、不及时，乃至有误。
    （四）宏观控制有空可钻。比如，过去对一些重大技术设备的引进实行“统一审批，归口管理”，但把合资方式的引进排除在外。结果这一领域的重复引进未能得到必要的限制。
    另外，在一些部门和地区组织的中央审批限额以下的技术引进项目中，没有注重专业化、系列化，没有处理好引进与中央计划、部门计划和地区计划的关系，存在着一定的盲目性。
    在我国目前外汇较为短缺的情况下，为了切实做到好钢用在刀刃上，提高技术引进投资的宏观综合效益，必须下大功夫，有重点地严格限制重复引进。为此，要做好以下几方面的工作：
    ——优化审批制度，把现行的国家单一额度控制改为额度、规模双重控制。即限额以上的技术引进项目继续由中央审批；限额以下的项目，根据各地的具体情况，由中央统一规划，确定各部门，各地区的引进规模，不许突破，在此前提下，各部门、各地区审批限额以下的项目。
    ——改进宏观调控。限制重复引进，关键在于有关调控部门有无新招。一提加强宏观调控，就片面地重操收权的老办法显然是不行的。除了堵塞审批制度上的漏洞之外，更主要的恐怕还是要充分发挥税收、信贷、价格等经济杠杆的作用，以及通过健全经济法规，来有效限制重复引进。
    ——把国家对部门、地区和企业技术引进的单一近期经济效益考核指标，改变为近期经济效益、远期经济效益、技术设备利用率和资金占用率等多种考核指标，以迫使部门、地区和企业切实注重远期经济效益。
    ——完善技术引进信息管理系统。国家应建立一个统一的技术引进信息数据管理系统，对现有技术引进进行必要的信息普查和登记，在此基础上建立技术引进登记制度，及时向社会发布有关信息。
