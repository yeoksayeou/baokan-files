**Big Waves in the Sea**

A strange incident occurred in Jiaoling County, Guangdong Province. A young man from Fufu Village, known as "Liao Guangun," stole two coffins from his neighbor's home just before the Spring Festival. He sold them and made 400 yuan. Shortly after the Spring Festival, he was arrested by the police.

The number of people transitioning from rural to urban status ("农转非") in China has exceeded 40 million over the past nine years, averaging 4.7 million people per year. It is reported that the state spends 4.8 billion yuan annually on this issue, creating a significant burden. Due to the lack of coordinated policy, this worrying trend continues to grow.

The famous Xunyang Tower, known from the novel "Water Margin" for its association with Song Jiang's exile to Jiangzhou (now Jiujiang) and his drunken poem, has been rebuilt on the banks of the Xunyang River in Jiangxi Province. This new tourist attraction is a major addition to the area's scenery. The original Xunyang Tower was built during the Tang Dynasty, over 1,200 years ago. The newly reconstructed tower covers a total area of 1,800 square meters and is modeled after Song Dynasty architecture, presenting a grand and majestic appearance.

　　蕉岭有奇事　廖光棍窃棺下狱    
    九江添新景　浔阳楼重展雄姿
    ●广东省蕉岭县富足村青年廖某，人称“廖光棍”。今年春节前夕，他趁邻居忙于购置年货之机，盗走邻居备置的两副棺木，卖掉后得赃款４００元。春节刚过，廖某就被警方捉拿归案。

    ●９年来，我国“农转非”人口已超过４０００万，平均每年４７０万人。据悉，国家为此每年支出４８亿元，成为一大负担。由于政出多门，目前这一令人忧虑的势头仍有增无减。

    ●因《水浒》记载宋江发配江州（今九江）醉酒题反诗而蜚声海内外的浔阳楼，今又在江西省浔阳江边重展雄姿，成为一处旅游新景点。浔阳楼始建于唐代，距今１２００多年。新修复的浔阳楼总建筑面积１８００平方米，系仿宋建筑，气势雄伟壮观。
