Wan Li, during his visit to Canada, attended a banquet hosted by the Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia.

NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) — Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said tonight that he believes exchanges between China and the Canadian province of British Columbia will continue to develop in various fields.

Wan Li made the remarks at a banquet hosted by Lieutenant Governor David Lam in his honor. He praised British Columbia's policy of embracing various cultures and promoting ethnic harmony as "very wise," saying it "benefits from absorbing the essence of different cultures."

Wan Li expressed confidence that during Lam's term, exchanges between China and the province will definitely continue to develop in various fields.

British Columbia is the gateway for Canada to the Asia-Pacific region. As early as the late 18th century, merchant ships were already traveling between China and the province. In recent years, trade, economic and technological cooperation, and cultural exchanges between China and the province have been increasingly developing. According to Canadian customs statistics, the bilateral trade volume between the province and China in 1988 exceeded 400 million Canadian dollars (approximately 320 million US dollars).

Wan Li arrived in Victoria, the capital of British Columbia, this afternoon. The city has been a sister city with Suzhou, China, since 1980.

NEW DELHI, May 15 (Xinhua) — Wan Li arrived in Regina this afternoon to visit Saskatchewan, Canada's largest wheat-producing base.

Since the 1960s, China has become an important market for Saskatchewan's wheat and potash exports. In 1988, the bilateral trade volume between China and the province reached 1.1289 billion Canadian dollars (approximately 948 million US dollars), accounting for about one-third of the total trade volume between China and Canada. The province plays an important role in Sino-Canadian economic relations.

In his brief speech at the provincial legislature this afternoon, Wan Li emphasized that friendly cooperation between Saskatchewan and China "has superior conditions and great potential."
