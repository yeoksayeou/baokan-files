Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 23rd. (Reporter: Jiǎo Mǎo Shēng) The weather is getting hotter, but the number of licensed ice cream stalls in the ancient city of Xi'an is only around 500, which is just 10% of last year's figure. Many unlicensed vendors have taken to the streets, pushing carts and setting up stalls, becoming targets for city management officials to shut down and drive away.

Xi'an's six urban and suburban districts used to have around 4,000 to 5,000 ice cream stalls during the summer, mostly concentrated on main streets and bustling areas, with brisk business and convenience for the public. This year, relevant departments in the city emphasized tidying up the urban environment, stipulating that main roads and bustling areas are not allowed to have stalls, and other streets setting up sporadic stalls must also be strictly controlled, with the principle of not opening new stalls. This has led to an influx of unlicensed ice cream vendors onto the streets.

The significant reduction in licensed stalls and the widespread presence of unlicensed vendors have caused concern among officials from the Industrial and Commercial Administration, Taxation, and other departments. They believe that tidying up the urban environment is undoubtedly correct, but it is also necessary to convenience the public. It is not realistic to completely ban individual stalls from occupying the streets. Bustling streets have high demand and do not allow stalls, persuading them to obtain licenses and set up in back alleys is also difficult. It is understood that Xi'an has already seen a situation where, on the one hand, people cannot buy soda, and on the other hand, branded soda is accumulating. Therefore, relevant officials believe that it is necessary to plan appropriately to set up some stalls in various alleys and main roads' pedestrian areas, allowing individual vendors to operate legally with licenses, to convenience the public.

　　西安市冷饮摊控制过严
    据新华社西安５月２３日电  （记者姜卯生）天气很快热起来了，可古城西安的有证冷饮摊点才有５００来户，仅相当于去年同期的１０％。不少无证经营者趁机走上街头，推车摆摊，成为市管人员取缔和驱赶的对象。
    西安市城郊６个区，往年夏季冷饮摊点约四五千个，大都集中在主要大街和繁华地区，生意红火，方便群众。今年市有关部门强调整顿市容，规定主干道和繁华地区一律不许摆摊设点，其余所有街道设置零星摊位也要严格控制，原则上不再开设新点。这样，造成了无证冷饮商贩纷纷走上街头。
    有证摊点的大量减少和无证商贩的普遍存在，使工商、税务等部门的同志感到忧虑。他们认为，整顿市容卫生无疑是对的，但也要方便群众，完全不准个体摊点占道经营是不现实的。繁华街面人多需求量大不让摆摊，劝他们办照到背街小巷又不干，也是困难的。据了解，西安市已出现，一方面人们买不到汽水，而另一方面名牌汽水积压的不正常状况。因此，有关人士认为，应当有规划地在各个街巷和主要干道的行人处适当设一些点，让个体商贩持照合法经营，以方便群众。
