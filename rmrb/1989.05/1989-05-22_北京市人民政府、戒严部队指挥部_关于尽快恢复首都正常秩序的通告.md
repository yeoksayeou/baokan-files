Beijing Municipal Government and Martial Law Command on Quickly Restoring Order in the Capital

Currently, the production and living order in the capital is in a state of considerable chaos. Many places are experiencing traffic disruptions, public transportation has not yet resumed, and some units are finding it difficult to carry out production and work. Schools have not returned to normal teaching, the sanitation situation in the city is worrying, and a small number of unidentified individuals are taking advantage of the situation to create disturbances and disrupt social order. They are stopping and looting vehicles, assaulting soldiers, illegally setting up checkpoints, searching pedestrians, and checking IDs. There is also a group of motorcyclists who are recklessly driving on the streets, seriously endangering the personal safety of citizens. These incidents have caused great unease and concern among the people of the capital, who urgently hope to restore normal order. Therefore, the Beijing Municipal Government and the Martial Law Command issue the following notice on related matters:

1. There are many rumors circulating in society, which are intentionally created by a small number of people with ulterior motives to confuse people and exacerbate conflicts. This is unacceptable. The broad masses of the people should distinguish right from wrong and be vigilant against deception.

2. Recently, the number of people from outside Beijing entering the city has significantly increased, making it difficult to solve problems related to food and accommodation, and adding considerable difficulties to the restoration of normal order in the capital. These individuals are urged to leave Beijing as soon as possible and return to their original units. All relevant parties should actively do their part.

3. Employees of all government agencies, organizations, factories, schools, shops, and enterprises should stay at their posts, maintain production, and do their work. All schools should resume normal teaching.

4. Troops assigned to enforce martial law in parts of Beijing should fulfill their duties. All relevant parties and the people should actively cooperate and provide support.

5. Traffic police should stay at their posts and perform their duties. Other individuals should not set up checkpoints and disrupt traffic control. Currently, some people are stopping vehicles, conducting forced inspections, and setting up obstacles, which must be stopped immediately.

    关于尽快恢复首都正常秩序的通告
    新华社北京５月２２日电  北京市人民政府、戒严部队指挥部关于尽快恢复首都正常秩序的通告
    目前，首都生产、生活秩序处于相当严重的混乱状态。许多地方交通受阻，公共交通尚未恢复，一些单位的生产、工作难以进行，学校的教学没有转入正常，市区环境卫生状况令人担忧，极少数不明身份的人乘机制造事端，扰乱社会治安。他们拦阻、抢劫车辆，扭打军人，非法设立哨卡、对行人搜身，检查身份证。更有一伙摩托车队，在街道上横冲直撞，严重地危及了市民的人身安全。这些，已经引起首都广大人民群众极大的不安和忧虑，迫切希望尽快恢复正常秩序。为此，北京市人民政府、戒严部队指挥部就有关事项通告如下：
    一、现在社会上有不少谣言，是极少数别有用心的人故意制造的，企图搅乱人心，激化矛盾。这是不能允许的。广大人民群众要明辨是非，谨防上当。
    二、最近涌入北京市的外地人员明显增多，不仅吃住问题难以解决，而且给首都恢复正常秩序增加了很大困难。希望这些人员尽快离开北京，返回原单位。各有关方面要积极做好工作。
    三、各机关、团体、工厂、学校、商店和企事业单位的工作人员，要坚守岗位，坚持生产，做好工作。所有学校都应坚持正常教学。
    四、奉命执行北京市部分地区戒严任务的部队，要认真履行自己的职责。各有关方面和人民群众要积极配合，尽力支援。
    五、交通警察应坚守岗位，尽职尽责。其他人员不得擅自设岗设卡，扰乱交通指挥。当前有些人拦阻车辆，强行检查，设置障碍，必须立即停止。
