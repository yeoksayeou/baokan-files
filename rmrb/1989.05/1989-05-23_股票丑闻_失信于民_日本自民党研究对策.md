The Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of Japan today established a committee headed by Deputy Secretary-General Mizuno to study and formulate ways for the party to take responsibility and alleviate the political distrust caused by the stock scandal. Prime Minister Takeshita stated this afternoon at the Prime Minister's Official Residence that he will naturally comply with the party's proposed solution.

The LDP's reputation has been severely damaged by the stock scandal. This morning, the Minister of Justice stated that, apart from the two lawmakers who were indicted yesterday, it would be difficult to pursue criminal charges against the other 11 lawmakers involved in the case. The LDP breathed a sigh of relief, but at the same time, they realize that without some form of apology from influential figures within the party who are involved in the case, public outrage will not be appeased. Therefore, a special committee was established to study how party members involved in the case should ultimately bear political and moral responsibility. The discussed specific methods include "suspension of party leadership positions" and "resignation from parliament" in two categories of varying severity. Currently, the party tends to favor the lighter "suspension of party leadership positions" approach.

　　股票丑闻　失信于民
    日本自民党研究对策
    本报东京５月２３日电  记者于青报道：日本自民党今天成立以水野代理总务会长为首的委员会，研究制订该党承担责任的解决方式，以缓和因股票丑闻招致政治失信于民的现状。竹下首相今天下午在首相官邸向记者表示，理所当然地服从党制订的解决方式。
    自民党因股票丑闻信誉扫地。今天上午法务大臣表示，除昨天起诉的两名议员外，对其他１１名牵连利案的议员难以追究刑事责任。对此自民党如释重负，但同时深知，党内牵连利案的实力人物如不以某种形式表示谢罪，难平民愤。故成立专门委员会，研究牵连利案党内议员如何承担政治和道义责任的最终解决方式。议论中的具体方式包括“停止党内领导职务”和“辞去议员”等轻重不同的两类。目前党内倾向于避重就轻的前一种方式。
