Recently, the Ministry of Water Resources held a national rural hydropower work conference, formulated a plan to accelerate the development of rural small and medium-sized hydropower, and implemented measures.

Our country's rural hydropower resources are very rich, with 142 million kilowatts of small and medium-sized hydropower resources available for development. Since the reform and opening up, rural power construction has developed rapidly. By the end of last year, there were 819 counties in the country that mainly rely on local small and medium-sized hydropower for electricity, covering one-third of the country's administrative areas, 560 million square kilometers, and 300 million people and 300 million acres of farmland.

However, the lack of electricity in rural areas across the country is still very serious, and the power supply level is very low. There are at least 29 counties without electricity, and nearly one-quarter of the population has not yet used electricity. To quickly alleviate this situation, the national hydropower work conference recently held by the Ministry of Water Resources summarized and exchanged experiences, believing that in the near future, the national power grid cannot solve the power supply problem for vast rural areas, especially remote mountainous areas. These areas, however, have abundant hydropower resources. It is both necessary and possible to vigorously develop this type of renewable energy that does not require fuel or transportation, has low investment, and shows quick results. According to the plan, in the next three years, the country will increase its installed capacity by 700,000 kilowatts annually. After completing the construction of 100 pilot counties for electrification, 200 more pilot counties will be built during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, and by the end of the century, a total of 600 primary electrification counties will be built.

### 加速发展农村中小水电  水利部召开会议落实措施

　　加速发展农村中小水电
    水利部召开会议落实措施
    本报讯  记者萧俊熙报道：最近，水利部召开了全国农村水电工作会议，制订了加速发展农村中小水电的规划，落实了措施。
    我国农村水力资源十分丰富，可供开发的中小水电资源有１．４２亿千瓦，改革开放以来，农村电力建设发展迅速，截至去年底统计，全国主要靠地方中小水电供电的县有８１９个，覆盖了全国１／３的行政区域、５６０万平方公里和３亿人口、３亿亩耕地。
    但是，全国广大农村缺电仍十分严重，供电水平很低，至少还有２９个无电县，近１／４的人口没用上电。为尽快缓解这种状况，最近水利部召开的全国水电工作会议，总结交流经验，认为近期内国家大电网不可能解决广大农村特别是边远山区的用电问题，而这些地区又多有丰富的水电资源，大力发展这一不需燃料、运输，投资省见效快的再生能源，既需要又有可能。按照规划，近三年内全国每年增加７０万千瓦装机容量，继完成１００个电气化试点县建设后，“八五”期间再建２００个试点县，到本世纪末共建成６００个初级电气化县。
