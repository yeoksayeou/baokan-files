A Japanese Liberal Democratic Party member, Shikei Aiko, announced today that she is leaving the Liberal Democratic Party to form a new party.

Shikei Aiko, originally named Anzai Aiko, is a nationally renowned female singer. She is 72 years old this year and was elected to the House of Councillors in 1971.

At a press conference, she announced her reasons for leaving the Liberal Democratic Party: her supporters want her to engage in political activities with a spirit of reform. It is believed that this is a response to the widespread public distrust of politics due to the involvement of most Liberal Democratic Party leaders in the notorious "Recruit Company bribery case."

She will establish a new party called "The Sun Party" and participate in the House of Councillors election scheduled for July and August this year.

It is believed that this is the first instance of a member leaving the Liberal Democratic Party due to the "Recruit Company bribery case."

　　日本一自民党议员
    脱党后另立新党
    新华社东京５月１９日电  一名叫志村爱子的自民党议员今天宣布脱离自民党，另立新党。
    志村爱子原名安西爱子，是一位全国著名的女歌手，今年已经７２岁，１９７１年当选为参议院议员。
    她在记者招待会上宣布脱离自民党的理由是，她的支持者要她以改革的精神进行政治活动。据认为这是对目前自民党多数领导人涉嫌臭名远扬的“利库路特公司行贿案”，导致民众对政治的不信任而作出的反应。
    她将成立一个名为“太阳之会”的新党，参加预定在今年７、８月间举行的参议院选举。
    据认为，这是第一个因为“利库路特公司行贿案”而脱离自民党的议员。
