The Four-Nation Women's Volleyball Invitational Tournament concluded in Chengdu tonight. Despite the enthusiastic support of tens of thousands of fans, the Chinese women's volleyball team lost 0-3 to the Cuban team. The scores for the three sets were 14-16, 2-15, and 8-15. The Cuban team won the championship of the tournament held in Chengdu, while the Chinese team secured the second place.

Local experts believe that the Chinese team lacked powerful attacks and their coordination was poor. The team's past strengths of quick and high-speed combinations were absent.

Both teams fielded their strongest lineups for tonight's match. The Chinese team included players such as No. 1 Lai Yawen, No. 2 Li Guojun, No. 7 Su Huijuan, and No. 12 Wu Dan. The Cuban team featured players like No. 3 Luis, No. 4 Ysaguerdo, No. 8 Bel, and No. 15 Cavajal.

In the first set, the Chinese team led 14-11, but failed to capitalize on the opportunity, ultimately losing the set 16-14. In the second and third sets, the Chinese team's formation was chaotic, struggling to organize effective attacks and lacking in powerful spikes. In contrast, the Cuban team grew stronger as the match progressed, particularly Luis, whose multi-directional spikes were unstoppable. It is widely believed that the Cuban team's strength was significantly superior to that of the Chinese team.

This afternoon, the Japanese team defeated the American team 3-0, securing third place in the tournament, while the American team finished fourth.

Luis of the Cuban team stood out in this tournament, winning the Best Athlete and Best Spiker awards.

Tomorrow, the women's volleyball teams from China, Japan, Cuba, and the United States will depart for Beijing.

　　四国女排邀请赛在成都战罢
    中国女排０∶３负于古巴队
    新华社成都５月２４日电  （记者徐波、李贺普）今晚，虽有成千上万的球迷为中国女排摇旗呐喊，无奈古巴队攻势如潮，中国姑娘终于以０∶３败下阵来。三局的比分为１４∶１６、２∶１５和８∶１５。古巴队获得在成都举行的四国女排国际邀请赛冠军，中国队获得亚军。
    这里的行家们认为，中国队缺少强攻，配合欠佳，过去高快结合的特点没有了。
    今晚的比赛双方都排出了最强阵容。中国队上场的队员是１号赖亚文、２号李国君、７号苏惠娟、１２号巫丹等；古巴队有３号路易斯、４号依斯格尔多、８号贝尔和１５号卡瓦哈尔等。
    第一局比赛中国女排曾以１４∶１１领先，但是没能把握住胜利的机会，反被古巴队以１６∶１４拿下第一局。第二、第三局，中国队阵脚大乱，很难组织起有效的进攻，强攻也乏力。相反，古巴队越战越勇，尤其是路易斯的多线路重扣，势不可当。人们认为，古巴队的实力高出中国队一大截。
    今天下午，日本队以３∶０战胜美国队，日本队获得这次比赛的第三名，美国队获得第四名。
    古巴队的路易斯在这次比赛中表现突出，获得了最佳运动员奖和最佳扣球手奖。
    明天，中、日、古、美四国女排将离开这里前往北京。
