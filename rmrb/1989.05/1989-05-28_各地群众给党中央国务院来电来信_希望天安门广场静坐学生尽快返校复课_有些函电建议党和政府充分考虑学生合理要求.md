Citizens from various places have sent letters and calls to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressing concern for the students still sitting in at Tiananmen Square and urging them to return to school and resume classes as soon as possible. Some of the letters and calls suggest that the Party and the government should fully consider the students' reasonable demands.

According to the Central Office and the State Council Office's Letters and Visits Bureau, in recent days, citizens from various places have been deeply concerned about the students still sitting in at Tiananmen Square. They have continuously sent letters and calls to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, requesting to convey to these students the message to withdraw from Tiananmen Square and return to school as soon as possible. A citizen from Haidian District, Beijing, wrote in a letter that citizens and students alike should be rational. Everything has its process. Order must be restored as soon as possible. Only when the government can function normally can existing problems be solved. The person in charge of the Five Metals and Building Materials Sales Department in Datong District, Daqing City, Heilongjiang Province, called to appeal: Dear students, the Party and the government have given clear answers to the issues you raised. Now what is needed is rationality and restraint, solving problems within the framework of democracy and the rule of law. We hope students will immediately stop the sit-in, return to school, and prove their patriotism with their actions. Forty-four middle school students from Meicheng Middle School, Anhua County, Hunan Province, called to say that they highly praise the patriotic spirit of their elder brothers and sisters, but they do not support the protests and sit-ins that are detrimental to the country, the people, and themselves. The Party Branch of the Jiangjin Oilxi Comprehensive Factory in Sichuan Province called to say that students should love the country and consider the overall situation and should not continue the sit-in.

Some letters and calls suggest that the Party and the government should fully consider the students' reasonable demands and provide convenience for them to withdraw from Tiananmen Square. Some students sitting in at Tiananmen Square have also expressed similar opinions. The Central Office and the State Council Office's Letters and Visits Bureau have conveyed these opinions to the central leaders. The central leaders instructed the Central Office and the State Council Office's Letters and Visits Bureau to once again tell the students: The Party Central Committee and the State Council fully affirm the students' patriotic enthusiasm, will not pursue responsibility for some students who have made excessive statements and actions, and will provide convenience for students to withdraw from the square. They will continue to have extensive and multi-level dialogues with students and other people from all walks of life. Now the weather is hot, and the sanitary conditions on the square are poor. If an epidemic occurs, the consequences will be unimaginable. We hope that all students will cherish their health, return to school and resume classes as soon as possible, and actively work to restore normal order in the capital and various places.

　　各地群众给党中央国务院来电来信
    希望天安门广场静坐学生尽快返校复课
    有些函电建议党和政府充分考虑学生合理要求
    新华社北京５月２８日讯  中央办公厅、国务院办公厅信访局消息：近几天来，各地群众对仍在天安门广场静坐的学生甚为关切，不断给党中央、国务院来电来信，要求转告这些学生尽快撤离天安门广场，回校复课。北京市海淀区一位市民来信说，市民、学生，大家都要理智，什么事情都有个过程。要尽快恢复秩序，只有政府能正常工作，才能解决存在的问题。黑龙江省大庆市大同区五金建材经销处负责人来电呼吁：亲爱的同学们，你们提出的问题党和政府已明确的答复了，现在需要的是理智、克制，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。希望同学们立即停止静坐，返校复课，用自己的行动证明自己的爱国之心。湖南省安化县梅城中学４４位中学生来电说，我们高度赞扬大哥大姐们的爱国精神，但不赞成于国于民于己不利的游行、静坐。四川江津油溪综合厂党支部来电说，学生既要爱国，就要顾全大局，不能继续静坐了。
    有些来信来电建议党和政府充分考虑学生的合理要求，并为他们撤离天安门广场提供方便。有的在天安门广场静坐的学生也反映了同样的意见。中办国办信访局已将这些意见转达中央领导同志。中央领导同志嘱中办国办信访局再次告诉广大学生：党中央、国务院充分肯定了学生的爱国热情，对一些有过激言行的同学不追究责任，为学生撤离广场提供方便，继续广泛地以多种层次、多种渠道与学生以及其他各界人士座谈对话。现在天气炎热，广场卫生条件很差，一旦发生疫情，后果不堪设想。希望广大学生爱惜身体，尽快返校复课，为恢复首都和各地正常秩序而积极努力。
