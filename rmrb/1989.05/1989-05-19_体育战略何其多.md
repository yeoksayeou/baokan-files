Title: There Are So Many Sports Strategies

Developing competitive sports should logically focus on the quadrennial Olympic Games. The State Sports Commission has clearly outlined the "Olympic Strategy" plan. However, local sports commissions have their own calculations, focusing on the gains and losses at the National Games, and manipulating the "National Games Strategy."

This is understandable. When evaluating a province's sports achievements, the emphasis is not on how many talents have been sent to the national team or how many Olympic medals have been won, but rather on the results of the National Games. In the sixth National Games held two years ago, Guizhou, which had not won a gold medal in five previous games, achieved a breakthrough on the gold medal table. The director of the provincial sports commission was promoted, while several provinces with poor results saw their sports commission directors demoted.

The problem doesn't stop there. If the Asian Games next year are not successful, it will inevitably affect the next Olympic Games. Thus, the "Asian Games Strategy" has become an urgent matter. Many local sports authorities, after sending athletes to the national team, seem to have nothing else to contribute. As soon as summer arrives, the second National Youth Games will commence, which is akin to another exam. As a result, the "Youth Games Strategy" overshadows the "Asian Games Strategy."

The City Games, established last autumn, provided a stage for cities with conditions, while those without were criticized. Since provincial team athletes cannot participate in the City Games, cities had to start from scratch, creating another "City Games Strategy."

Alas, there are so many "strategies"! Who knows what other tricks there might be? The sports community has been advocating "train at home, unite against the outside world" for many years, but this chess game can never be coordinated. The reasons are many. However, small matters should yield to big matters. Multiple strategies are equivalent to no strategy. Without resolving the internal friction caused by multiple strategies, achieving the highest level of competitive sports in the "Olympic Strategy" will be difficult.

### 体育战略何其多

　　体育战略何其多
    汪大昭
    发展竞技体育，照理应把着眼点放在四年一度的奥运会上。国家体委也明确提出了“奥运战略”的规划。然而，各地体委另有一把算盘，围绕着全运会的得失，拨弄“全运战略”的算珠。
    这也难怪，衡量一个省体育成就，不看重向国家队输送了多少人才，拿了几块奥运会奖牌，倒是全运会上的成绩变得更重要。前年的第六届全运会上，五届不开张的贵州实现了金牌榜上零的突破，省体委主任得到晋升，战绩不佳的好几个省，体委主任则下了台。
    问题还不止于此。明年的亚运会打不好，势必影响下届奥运会。于是，“亚运战略”便成了当务之急。而许多地方体育主管部门将国手上送之后，似乎没有什么其它贡献可做，夏天一过，第二届全国青运会就要开战，无异于又一场考试。结果，“青运战略”压倒了“亚运战略”。
    去年秋天创办的城运会，有条件的城市找到了舞台，没条件的挨了敲打，省队选手既然不能参加城运会，城市就得另起炉灶，又弄出个“城运战略”。
    呜呼，“战略”何其多！不知还有什么花样？体育界喊了多少年“国内练兵，一致对外”，这一盘棋总也调度不起来，原因固然很多。可是，小道理应服从大道理，多战略就等于无战略。不解决多战略造成的内耗，要实现竞技体育最高层次的“奥运战略”，怕是不容易。
