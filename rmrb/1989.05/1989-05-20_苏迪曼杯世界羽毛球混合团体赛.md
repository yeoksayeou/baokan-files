On May 29, 1987, the International Badminton Federation (IBF) Council announced in Beijing that starting from 1989, a World Badminton Mixed Team Championship would be established. This championship would be held in the same location as the biennial World Badminton Championships, with the winner receiving the "Sudirman Cup."

The "Sudirman Cup" is named in honor of Dick Sudirman, the founder of the Indonesian Badminton Association and former vice-president of the IBF.

Sudirman (1922-1986) is considered the "father of Indonesian badminton." In 1948, he won the Indonesian singles championship. In 1952, he founded the Indonesian Badminton Association and served as its chairman for 22 years. In 1975, he was elected as the vice-president of the IBF. As a proactive advocate, he played a major role in merging the original International Badminton Federation and the World Badminton Federation into the IBF in 1981.

In recognition of Sudirman's contributions to the world of badminton and the request from the Indonesian Badminton Association, the IBF decided to name the World Badminton Mixed Team Championship trophy the "Sudirman Cup."

The purpose of establishing this event is to provide more opportunities for the 76 member associations of the IBF to participate in world competitions and to offer more training opportunities.

The mixed team competition is conducted in a tiered format, with each match consisting of men's and women's singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, totaling five games. The competition uses a best-of-five format.

To make the competition more intense, the mixed team competition also adopts a promotion and relegation system. Teams finishing last in each tier are relegated to the lower tier, while teams finishing first in the lower tier are promoted to the upper tier.

The first competition featured 30 teams. The IBF divided the teams into seven levels based on their performance and results in international competitions.

China, Indonesia, South Korea, Denmark, England, and Sweden were listed as A-level teams. The Sudirman Cup will be awarded to the team that wins the A-level competition.

　　苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛
    １９８７年５月２９日，国际羽联理事会曾在北京宣布：从１９８９年起设立世界羽毛球混合团体赛，并和两年一度的世界羽毛球锦标赛同地先后举行，冠军杯称为“苏迪曼杯”。
    “苏迪曼杯”是为了纪念印度尼西亚羽毛球协会创始人、前国际羽联副主席迪克·苏迪曼而命名的。
    苏迪曼（１９２２年—１９８６年）被认为是印尼“羽毛球之父”。１９４８年，他曾获得印尼单打冠军。他１９５２年创建了印尼羽协，并任协会主席长达２２年。１９７５年，他当选为国际羽联副主席。作为积极倡议者，他为促使原国际羽联和世界羽联在１９８１年合并为国际羽联，起了主要作用。
    国际羽联根据苏迪曼对世界羽毛球运动做出的贡献和印尼羽协的请求，决定将世界羽毛球混合团体赛冠军杯定名为“苏迪曼杯”。
    该赛事的设立，目的是为了让国际羽联７６个会员有更多机会参加世界比赛，提供锻炼机会。
    混合团体赛以分级的办法进行，规定比赛双方进行男女单打、双打和混合双打共５盘比赛，采用５战３胜制。
    为使比赛争夺更加激烈，混合团体赛还采取升降级制，即获每一级最后一名的队降至下一级，获下一级第一名的队晋升上一级。
    首届比赛共有３０个代表队参赛，国际羽联根据各队水平和在国际大赛中的战绩，共分７个级别。
    中国、印尼、南朝鲜、丹麦、英格兰和瑞典队被列为Ａ级队。苏迪曼杯将由获Ａ级比赛冠军的队获得。
