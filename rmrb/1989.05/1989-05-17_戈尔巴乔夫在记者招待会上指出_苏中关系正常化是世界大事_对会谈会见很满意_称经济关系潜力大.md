Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 17th.

Gorbachev, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, said that the high-level meeting between the Soviet Union and China and the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will have a positive impact on the overall world situation. This was stated by Gorbachev at a press conference in Beijing in response to questions from reporters.

Gorbachev said that over the past few days, he has had active and substantial talks with Chinese leaders, visited the cityscape and historical sites of Beijing, and met with Beijing citizens. We are very satisfied with the talks and meetings. This round of talks is a major event in the history of Sino-Soviet relations, and from a global perspective, it is also a significant event. The high-level meeting between the Soviet Union and China marks the beginning of a new stage in Sino-Soviet relations. He said that the Soviet Union respects and understands China's independent and autonomous policy on the international stage, and China treats the Soviet Union's foreign principles with the same attitude. The two countries have reached a mutual understanding on many issues. In their views on the world situation, there are also common points. Here, he referred to Deng Xiaoping's idea of establishing a new international political order, which is similar to the Soviet Union's new thinking. On the Cambodian issue, both sides have a better understanding of each other's positions. He said that one of the conditions for solving the Cambodian issue is that all parties concerned should participate in the political resolution process. We also had an in-depth discussion on the work plan to resolve the Sino-Soviet border issue and decided to hand over the most important issues to the ministerial-level talks between the two countries. Gorbachev pointed out that there is still great potential in Sino-Soviet economic relations. He and Premier Li Peng both advocate building economic cooperation between the two countries on a long-term basis. The two sides also exchanged views on domestic issues and frankly reported the difficulties encountered in the reform process. He said that this visit to China was short, and most of the time was spent in talks, but there was also an opportunity to learn about the ancient and unique culture of this great country and to feel the vibrant rhythm of social life.

When talking about the relationship between the two parties in China and the Soviet Union, Gorbachev said that this relationship should be based on mutual respect and equal cooperation, respecting each other's views and experiences, and not interfering in each other's internal affairs. This is the experience we have gained after much suffering.

When asked about his views on Beijing students taking to the streets to protest, he said that he had received many friendly letters from students welcoming his visit, believing that my visit has elevated the relationship between the two countries to a new level. They praised the efforts of the Soviet people on the path of reform, including efforts in openness and democratization. I agree with their position. I know that the Chinese leadership is in dialogue with youth and various sectors of society, and we welcome this. I wish China to find an appropriate solution and successfully move towards a path of fully realizing the potential of socialism.

When a Soviet reporter asked Gorbachev to share his impressions of his visit to China with Soviet television viewers from Beijing, he said that in China, I saw the same situation as in the Soviet Union, that is, Sino-Soviet friendship has taken root in the hearts of the Chinese people, and therefore the friendship between the two countries will continue to develop.

When asked about the sequence of political and economic reforms in the Soviet Union and China, Gorbachev said that he could not agree with this view because the Soviet Union first solved the urgent economic problems. When we solved these problems, we found that the problems were much deeper than we had expected. Without political reform, it would be impossible to solve economic problems, so we began political reform.

When asked how to ensure the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union after the abolition of censorship on literary and news works, Gorbachev said that newspapers are subject to control, but this is the control of the people. A draft of the press law is currently being prepared, and discussions will be held after the new power structure is formed.

　　戈尔巴乔夫在记者招待会上指出    
    苏中关系正常化是世界大事    
    对会谈会见很满意　称经济关系潜力大
    本报北京５月１７日讯  记者周象光报道：苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫说，苏中高级会晤和苏中关系实现正常化，将对整个世界形势产生积极的影响。这是戈尔巴乔夫主席在北京举行的记者招待会上回答记者提问时说的。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，我几天来同中国领导人进行了积极而充分的会谈，参观了北京市容和名胜古迹，并且会见了北京市民。我们对会谈和会见都很满意。这次会谈是中苏关系史上的重大事件，从全世界的大局看，也是一件大事。苏中高级会晤标志着苏中关系进入一个新的阶段。他说，苏联尊重和理解中国在国际舞台上奉行的独立自主的方针，中国也以同样的态度对待苏联的对外原则。两国在许多问题上取得了相互理解。在对世界局势的看法上，也有共同点，这里指的是，邓小平关于建立国际政治新秩序的思想，同苏联的新思维是相似的。在柬埔寨问题上，双方更好地了解了彼此的立场，他说，解决柬埔寨问题的条件之一，就是有关各方都应参加政治解决的进程。我们还深入地讨论了解决苏中边界问题的工作计划，并决定把最重要的问题交由两国部长级会议进行讨论。戈尔巴乔夫指出，苏中经济关系尚有较大的潜力，他和李鹏总理都主张，把两国的经济合作建立在长期的基础上。双方还就各自国内的问题交换了意见，坦率地通报了改革中遇到的困难。他说，此次访华，时间短暂，而且大部时间进行会谈，但也有机会了解了这个伟大国家古老而独特的文化，感受到了社会生活中充满活力的节奏。
    在谈到中苏两党的关系时，戈尔巴乔夫说，这种关系应当是建立在相互尊重基础上的平等合作，尊重彼此的观点和经验，互不干涉内部事务。这是我们饱经痛苦后得来的经验。
    有记者问戈尔巴乔夫，对北京学生上街游行持何看法？他说，他收到了学生给他的好多封很友好的信，对我的来访表示欢迎，并认为我的来访把我们两国的关系提高到了一个新的水平。他们称赞苏联人民在改革道路上所做的事情，包括在公开性和民主化方面所做的努力。我赞同他们的立场。我知道中国领导正在同青年和社会各阶层对话，我们对此表示欢迎。我祝愿中国找到适当的解决办法，顺利地走上更充分发挥社会主义潜力的道路。
    当苏联记者要求戈尔巴乔夫从北京对苏联电视观众谈谈访华观感时，他说，我在中国看到了与在苏联相同的情况，这就是，苏中友谊已在中国人民心中扎下了根，因此两国友谊将得到继续发展。
    有记者说，苏联是先进行政治改革，而中国则先进行经济改革，请他对这种次序安排作出评价。戈尔巴乔夫说，他不能同意这种说法，因为苏联首先解决的是迫切的经济问题。当我们解决这些问题时发现，问题比我们预想的要深刻得多，不改革政治，就不可能解决经济问题，因此我们着手政治改革。
    有记者问，在苏联取消了对文艺作品和新闻作品的检查制度后，如何保证苏联共产党的核心作用？戈尔巴乔夫说，报刊是受检查的，受控制的，但这是人民的控制。现在正在制订新闻法草案，在新的权力机构形成以后，将要开展讨论。
