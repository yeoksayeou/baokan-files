Hangzhou Automobile Engine Factory Donates Engine to Aid in Education

	The People's Daily reports that the Hangzhou Automobile Engine Factory of China Heavy Duty Truck Group recently donated a China·Steyr engine valued at 60,000 yuan to Xi'an Jiaotong University. This donation aims to enhance the teaching and scientific research capabilities of the university's internal combustion engine research room.

	Xi'an Jiaotong University's internal combustion engine research room is the first such specialized department established in China. It is responsible for over thirty scientific research projects commissioned by the state and various enterprises. However, the experimental equipment used for teaching and research is primarily from the 1940s and 1950s. For many years, due to financial constraints, it has been difficult to update this equipment. Upon learning of this situation, the Hangzhou Automobile Engine Factory promptly decided to donate the first China·Steyr engine produced using imported technology to Xi'an Jiaotong University.

　　杭汽厂赠发动机帮助办学
    本报讯  中国重型汽车集团杭州汽车发动机厂最近把一台价值六万元的中国·斯太尔发动机赠送给西安交通大学，以帮助这所学校的内燃机教研室提高教学、科研实验手段。
    西安交大内燃机教研室，是我国创办的第一个内燃机专业，承担着国家和企事业单位委托的三十多项科研课题。但教学、科研用实验装备大都是四、五十年代的产品。多年来，由于经费紧张始终难以更新。杭州汽车发动机厂得知这一情况，立即作出将该厂引进国外技术生产的第一台中国·斯太尔发动机赠送给西安交大的决定。
