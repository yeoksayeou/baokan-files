	The newspaper "New Nepal" reports that due to India's economic sanctions against Nepal, the normal life of the Nepalese people has been affected, and the country's economy is facing severe difficulties.

	Since the trade and transit agreements between the two countries expired on March 23, India has stopped or restricted the supply of essential goods to Nepal, closed 13 out of 15 border customs stations, and obstructed most of Nepal's trade with third countries.

	The newspaper said that due to the interruption of supplies of raw materials and equipment, many development projects in Nepal have been forced to halt.

	The newspaper quoted Finance Minister Pradhan as saying that the total loss caused by this crisis is difficult to calculate at present, but the direct economic loss this year is estimated to be 2 billion rupees (approximately $77 million). The planned increase in the country's GDP this year was 5%, but now it seems it can only increase by 1.6%.

	The report said that due to the shortage of petroleum products, people have had to use wood as a substitute. As a result, some forest protection measures taken in recent years have been in vain.

	The editorial called on the Nepalese people to continue to fully support the government's efforts to overcome the current crisis.

    印制裁导致尼严重经济困难
    新华社加德满都５月８日电  《新兴尼泊尔报》今天发表社论说，由于印度对尼泊尔实行经济制裁，尼泊尔不但人民的正常生活受到影响，而且国家经济也遇到严重困难。
    自从３月２３日两国的贸易和过境条约期满后，印度停止或限制对尼的必需品供应，关闭了１５个边境海关站中的１３个，导致尼泊尔与第三国的大部分贸易往来受阻。
    报纸说，由于原料及设备等的供应中断，尼泊尔许多发展项目被迫下马。
    报纸援引财政大臣普拉丹的话说，这次危机所带来的整个损失一时难以计算，但今年直接经济损失估计达２０亿卢比（约合７７００万美元）。今年国内生产总值计划增加５％，而现在看来只能增加１．６％。
    报道说，由于石油产品供应短缺，人们不得不以木材代之。结果，近年来所采取的一些保护森林措施，又前功尽弃。
    社论呼吁尼泊尔人民继续全力支持政府的努力，克服当前的危机。
