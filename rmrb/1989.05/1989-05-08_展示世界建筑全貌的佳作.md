The Architecture column

Architecture history is essentially the history of cultural life. The accumulation of architectural knowledge encompasses the historical development and changes in various aspects such as production, daily life, religion, culture, politics, and social interactions. Therefore, architecture history is closely related to everyone. To learn from the experiences of global architectural development and to choose the direction for Chinese architecture, there is an urgent need for a book that provides a comprehensive overview of world architecture. However, due to historical and social reasons, it is currently difficult to compile such a book domestically. The book "World Architecture History" by the British author Patrick Nuttgens (translated by Gu Mengchao and Zhang Baiping, published by Anhui Science and Technology Press) has been introduced, which may temporarily fill this gap.

The original author, Sir Patrick Nuttgens, is a member of the Royal Institute of British Architects and a renowned architect and architectural theorist. Since 1970, he has served as the principal of the University of Leeds and has also been the writer and host of the "Architecture and Education" special program on the British Broadcasting Corporation. His "World Architecture History" is widely regarded as an essential textbook for introductory education in architecture schools and an ideal reference book for non-professionals interested in studying architectural art. The author does not merely list and describe historical facts but seeks to explore the breadth of historical context, the depth of philosophical insights, and the liveliness of literary expression. Reading it provides theoretical enlightenment and artistic enjoyment.

As Chinese readers, when we come across the author's comparison of Chinese architecture within a global context, the insights are particularly profound. Nuttgens points out in his comparison: "Relatively speaking, it is easier to find a thread that connects the nearly 3,500 years of Chinese social history because China, in its isolation from the outside world, accelerated the maturity of Chinese culture. Later, it only adopted technologies that suited its national temperament, resulting in many fields remaining relatively static until this century." In the same chapter, the author also notes: "By the 19th century, China's stubborn adherence to using wood had threatened tropical forests, leading to the loss of many landscapes and exposed land. This was not because the Chinese were not skilled in using bricks. As early as the 3rd century BC, China had begun using brick arches and domes in tombs..."

Reading these passages, and seeing that large areas of China still use wood as the primary building material, leading to deforestation, extensive construction, and even the use of reinforced concrete structures mimicking ancient wooden structures, just as ancient China used the most advanced technologies (brick arches and domes) to build tombs and mausoleums... how can one not reflect deeply? History has always been an impartial judge. Those who do not face historical experiences and re-examine historical conclusions will only continue to be punished.

The publication of this book in China may spark controversy and thus invigorate academic discussions. Based on his personal in-depth field investigations and years of dedicated research, the author presents many unique insights worth further exploration by the academic and cultural communities.

　　展示世界建筑全貌的佳作
    木南
    建筑历史实际上是生活文化史，建筑知识积累的历史，包括生产、生活、宗教、文化、政治、社交等各方面活动发展变化的历史，因此建筑历史与每个人都有着密切的关系。为汲取世界建筑发展方面的经验，选择中国建筑的去向，迫切需要一本给人以世界建筑全貌的书，但由于历史和社会的原因，国内一时尚难编好。英国人帕瑞克·纽金斯著的《世界建筑艺术史》（顾孟潮、张百平译，安徽科技出版社出版）被介绍过来，或许可以应急填补这个空白。
    原著者帕瑞克·纽金斯勋爵，为英国皇家建筑学会会员，是世界知名的建筑师和建筑理论家。自１９７０年以来他担任利兹工艺大学校长，兼任英国广播电台“建筑与教育”专题节目作家和主持人。他的《世界建筑艺术史》被公认为是一本能满足建筑院校入门教育的必备教材，对于非专业而有兴趣研究建筑艺术的读者也是理想参考书。作者不满足于历史事实的罗列和描述，而追求历史背景的广度、哲学的深度和文学的生动性。读它使人得到理论思维上的启迪和艺术上的享受。
    作为中国读者，当我们读到作者把中国建筑放到世界范围内进行纵横比较的段落时，对我们的启发尤为深刻。纽金斯在这种对比后指出：“相对而言，想找到把中国近３５００年的社会历史串起来的线索是比较容易的，因为中国在与外界隔绝的情况下，促成了中国文化的早熟，而且后来只是选择那些适合自己民族气质的技术加以发展，以至于到本世纪尚有许多领域处于相对静止的状态。”作者在同一章又指出：“到１９世纪中国沿用木材的顽固习惯已经威胁到热带密林，致使许多景观丧失，土地裸露，而这样做并非是由于中国人不善于运用砖。公元前３世纪中国就已开始在陵墓上运用砖拱和穹顶……”读到这些，看到目前中国广大区域仍然是以木材为主要建筑材料，滥伐森林、大兴土木，甚至采用钢筋混凝土结构时还要作成仿古代木结构的形式，也像古代中国那样把当时最先进的技术（砖拱和穹顶），用来造坟墓、陵寝建筑……作为一个中国人怎么能不痛定思痛呢？历史从来是公正无私的法官，谁不正视历史经验，重新审视历史的结论，只能继续受到惩罚。
    该书在我国出版可能会引起争议从而活跃学术气氛。作者根据亲身深入现场实地考察，潜心研究多年的积累，提出不少独特见解，值得学术界、文化界进一步探讨。
