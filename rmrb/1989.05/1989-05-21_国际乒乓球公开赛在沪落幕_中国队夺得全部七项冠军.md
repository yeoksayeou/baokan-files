The Chinese International Table Tennis Open Championships concluded tonight in Shanghai. Following their victories in the men's and women's team events, Chinese athletes secured five additional titles in individual competitions.

The evening's finals saw the men's singles match between China's Chen Zhibin and South Korea's An Jae-hyeong, while the remaining four finals featured Chinese athletes competing against each other. The tournament's level was not particularly high due to the absence of key players from Sweden's men's team and South Korea's women's team.

The results of the five finals were as follows: In the mixed doubles, Chen Longcan and Chen Jing defeated Ma Wen'ge and Deng Yaping with a score of 2-1; in the men's singles, Chen Zhibin of China defeated An Jae-hyeong of South Korea with a score of 3-0, with the set scores being 21-19, 21-18, and 21-14; in the women's doubles, Chen Jing and Deng Yaping defeated Ding Yaping and Li Jun with a score of 2-0; in the men's doubles, Yu Shenping and Ma Wen'ge defeated Chen Longcan and Wei Qingguang with a score of 2-0; in the women's singles, Chen Jing lost to Deng Yaping with a score of 0-3.

    新华社上海５月２１日电  （记者谭军、黄平）中国国际乒乓球公开锦标赛今晚在这里结束。中国选手继获得男女团体冠军后，又获得５个单项冠军。
    今晚进行的单项决赛，除男子单打由中国的陈志斌和南朝鲜的安宰亨对阵外，其余４项决赛都在中国选手之间进行。这次公开赛因瑞典男队和南朝鲜女队主力没有参加，水平不是很高。
