Xinhua News Agency, Casablanca, May 26th.

The Arab League Special Summit concluded today in Casablanca, expressing "complete support" for the Palestinian people's ongoing uprising against Israeli occupation.

The final declaration reaffirmed the principles of the 1982 Fez Summit peace plan, celebrated the establishment of the State of Palestine, and declared the Arab nation's determination to mobilize all its potential to support the State of Palestine.

The declaration supported the convening of an international peace conference on the Middle East, attended by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and all parties involved in the conflict, including the PLO. The aim is to achieve a just, comprehensive, and lasting resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and other relevant resolutions.

The Arab leaders present fully supported the Palestinian position: advocating for elections to be held under international supervision in the occupied territories after Israel's withdrawal. These elections are part of the overall peace process aimed at ending Israeli occupation and achieving Palestinian self-determination.

Regarding the Lebanese issue, the declaration called for the implementation of UN Resolutions 425, 508, and 509, demanding Israel's immediate withdrawal from southern Lebanon.

The declaration opposed any attempts to divide Lebanon and supported the Lebanese people's reconciliation and unity.

The summit decided to establish a committee comprising King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, and President Chadli of Algeria to engage with various Lebanese factions to seek a resolution to the Lebanese problem. This committee will work to create a conducive atmosphere for the Lebanese Parliament to convene and discuss political reforms, and to hold presidential elections and form a national unity government within six months.

The declaration supported the cessation of hostilities between Iran and Iraq, and hoped that both countries would continue their efforts to consolidate peace, achieve stability, and ensure security.

The Arab leaders also emphasized the need for the Arab nation to overcome differences, strengthen unity, and face the challenges ahead.

　　阿盟特别首脑会议闭幕
    通过解决中东问题最后声明
    新华社卡萨布兰卡５月２６日电  阿拉伯特别首脑会议今天在这里闭幕，会议表示“完全支持”巴勒斯坦人民继续进行反对以色列占领的起义斗争。
    会议通过的最后声明重申了１９８２年非斯首脑会议的和平计划原则，欢呼巴勒斯坦国的成立，并表示阿拉伯民族有决心发掘全部潜力支持巴勒斯坦国。
    声明支持召开由联合国５个常任理事国和包括巴解组织在内的冲突有关各方参加的中东和平国际会议，以便在联合国安理会２４２号和３３８号决议和其它有关决议基础上使阿以冲突获得公正、全面和持久的解决。
    与会的阿拉伯领导人表示完全支持巴勒斯坦人的立场：即主张在以色列撤出被占领土以后并在国际监督下在被占领土举行选举。这种选举只是最终结束以色列占领和实现巴勒斯坦自决权的整个和平进程的一部分。
    声明在谈到黎巴嫩问题时说，会议要求执行联合国４２５号、５０８号和５０９号决议，使以色列立即撤出黎巴嫩南部。
    声明反对任何分裂黎巴嫩的企图，支持黎巴嫩人民的和解与团结。
    会议决定成立一个由摩洛哥国王哈桑二世、沙特国王法赫德和阿尔及利亚总统沙德利组成的委员会，同黎巴嫩各派进行接触，以寻求黎巴嫩问题的解决。这个委员会将努力创造一种良好的气氛，使黎巴嫩议会得以召集会议讨论政治改革问题，并在六个月之内举行总统选举和成立全国和解政府。
    声明支持伊朗和伊拉克之间实现停火，并希望两国为巩固和平、实现安定与稳定继续努力。
    阿拉伯领导人还强调，阿拉伯民族必须消除分歧，增强团结，以便迎接阿拉伯民族面临的挑战。
