On the morning of April 8, Mexico's top drug lord, Gallardo, had just woken up in his residence in Guadalajara, feeling a slight pain in his stomach, which he instinctively sensed as an omen. After getting out of bed, he pulled open the curtains, wearing his pajamas, and slowly walked down the stairs from the upstairs bedroom. Suddenly, several armed military police broke in through the back door and immediately pinned him to the ground. Faced with the sudden attack, Gallardo was so frightened that his whole body trembled. First, he begged the military police to kill him on the spot to end his life. After being refused, he declared that he was willing to pay $500 million for his freedom. But all this was in vain. The demon king was finally captured and taken to the capital, Mexico City, to await trial.

Gallardo's capture is a major victory for Mexico in its war on drugs, not only shocking the entire country but also influencing the United States and other Latin American countries. U.S. Secretary of State Baker praised, saying, "The Mexican government has shown political courage in this action," and "it has great significance for the anti-drug struggle."

Gallardo has been involved in drug trafficking since 1971 and has been wanted by Mexico and the United States for 18 years. It is said that among Gallardo's accomplices are several high-ranking police officers and prosecutors. These people, who are responsible for leading the anti-drug struggle, have colluded with drug lords, providing them with information and shelter. Among them are the heads of federal highway police in the capital and two northern states bordering the United States. Needless to say, drugs can flow freely. There are also federal prosecutors and heads of judicial police at the state level, who sell confidential information about the federal government's anti-drug deployments and action plans to drug traffickers.

According to Mexican media reports, in countries like Bolivia, Peru, and Colombia, drug trafficking organizations have their own terrorist armed forces. At the same time, they bribe and collude with politicians, judges, and police chiefs with large sums of money, influencing government policies and actions, becoming parallel power centers and "states within a state." The drug trafficking organizations in Colombia even boasted that as long as the government recognizes their legal existence, they can pay off all the government's foreign debts.

According to statistics, about 15% of the transactions in the U.S. drug market, amounting to more than $200 billion, are controlled by drug trafficking organizations in Latin American countries. Marijuana and heroin come partly from Mexico, while cocaine mainly comes from Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, which are major producers of coca. Because Mexico shares thousands of kilometers of border with the United States, it naturally becomes a bridge for drugs entering the United States. The United States has repeatedly blamed the Mexican government for this. Mexico, in turn, protests, arguing that the increasing demand for drugs within the United States attracts drug trafficking organizations to smuggle drugs from South America to North America, using Mexico as a "corridor." Mexico suffers greatly from this, spending huge sums of money and mobilizing large numbers of people and resources to capture and intercept drugs each year.

The U.S. government always insists on anti-drug cooperation as a condition when negotiating bilateral relations with Mexico and other Latin American countries.

Public opinion has repeatedly called for long-term effective international cooperation, tackling the drug problem from both supply and demand sides, and cracking down on various links such as drug cultivation, processing, illegal transactions, and consumption. However, "it takes more than a day to freeze three feet of ice." Drug abuse and trafficking have become a deeply rooted social problem in these countries. Therefore, the anti-drug struggle will inevitably continue for a long time.

　　毒枭落网　斗争未了
    本报记者  郭伟成
    ４月８日早晨，墨西哥的头号毒枭加利亚多在瓜达拉哈拉的寓所刚醒来，觉得肚子有点隐隐作痛，本能地预感到这是不祥之兆。起床后，他拉开窗帘，穿着睡衣从楼上卧室慢步下楼。突然，几个武装军警从后门破门而入，立即把他按倒在地。面临突如其来的袭击，加利亚多吓得全身发抖，先是请求军警把他当场杀了，以了结他的一生。遭拒绝后，他又宣称愿出５００万美元来换取他的自由。但这一切都落空了，魔王终于被捉拿归案，押解到首都墨西哥城，听候法庭审讯。
    加利亚多的落网是墨西哥在扫毒战中的一大胜利，不仅震惊了墨西哥全国，而且还影响了美国及其它拉美国家。美国国务卿贝克称赞说，墨西哥政府在这一行动中“显示出了政治勇气”，“对反毒斗争具有极大的意义”。
    加利亚多从１９７１年就开始贩毒，长期来为墨西哥和美国等所通缉，但始终逍遥法外达１８年之久。据说，加利亚多的同案犯中有一批高级警官与检察官。这些人肩负领导反毒斗争的重任，却与毒枭同流合污，为其通风报信，提供庇护。其中有首都以及北方与美国接壤的两个州的联邦公路警察头目，毋用说，毒品自然就畅行无阻了，还有州一级的联邦检察官、司法警察头子，向毒贩子出卖联邦当局反毒的部署、行动方案等绝密情报。
    据墨西哥报刊揭露，在玻利维亚、秘鲁、哥伦比亚等国，贩毒集团拥有自己的恐怖主义武装，同时，又以重金收买、勾结政客、法官、军警头目，影响政府制订有关政策与采取行动，成为与政府平行的权力中心和“国中之国”。哥伦比亚的贩毒集团甚至扬言，只要政府承认其合法存在，可以为政府偿清所有外债。
    据统计，美国毒品市场上约１５％的交易额，相当于２００多亿美元是由拉美国家的贩毒集团控制的。大麻叶和海洛因部分来自墨西哥，可卡因则主要来自秘鲁、玻利维亚、哥伦比亚等盛产古柯的地方。由于墨西哥与美国之间有着数千公里的边界，因此它自然成了毒品进入美国的桥梁。美国亦因此屡屡责怪墨西哥政府。墨西哥则大呼冤枉，认为美国国内对毒品需求日甚，吸引了贩毒集团把毒品从南美洲偷运到北美洲，把墨西哥当作“走廊”，墨西哥深受其害，每年耗费巨资，动用大量人力物力缉拿、堵截毒品。
    美国政府每次与墨西哥等拉美国家谈判双边关系问题时，总要把禁毒作为一条件，要求予以合作。
    舆论一再呼吁进行长期有效的国际合作，从供求两个方面着手抓住毒品种植、加工、非法交易和消费等各个环节，予以查禁。但是，“冰冻三尺，非一日之寒”，吸毒和贩毒已成了这些国家的一个根深蒂固的社会问题。因此，反毒斗争必定会长期进行下去。
