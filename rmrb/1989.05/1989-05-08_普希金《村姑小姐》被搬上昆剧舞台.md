Pushkin's "The Little House in Kolomna" Adapted for the Kunqu Stage

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 8th - (Reporter Zhao Wei) The famous Russian poet Pushkin's prose work "The Little House in Kolomna" has recently been adapted for the Chinese Kunqu stage.

On the Kunqu stage, Pushkin's noblewoman Lisa becomes the Chinese young lady Fan Ling, and the wealthy young man Aleksey becomes the rich young master Gao Huan.

The main plot of the Kunqu opera "The Little House in Kolomna" is as follows: The young master Gao, returning from the capital, encounters the young lady Fan disguised as a village girl in a birch forest, and they fall in love at first sight. The Gao and Fan families, each proud of their own status, can only allow the lovers to meet in secret. A chance event brings the two families together, and after a series of dramatic trials, the lovers finally unite in a hundred-year marriage.

Adapting Pushkin's prose into the ancient Chinese dramatic form of Kunqu is a bold attempt by Guo Qihong, deputy director of the Northern Kunqu Opera Theater. He believes that Kunqu is particularly suitable for expressing the poet's artistic vision.

　　普希金《村姑小姐》被搬上昆剧舞台
    新华社北京五月八日电  （记者赵玮）俄罗斯伟大诗人普希金的散文作品《村姑小姐》，近日被搬上中国的昆剧舞台。
    在昆剧舞台上，普希金笔下的贵族小姐丽莎变成了中国的大家闺秀樊铃，富家子弟阿历克赛成为阔家少爷高涣。
    昆剧《村姑小姐》的主要剧情是：从京城返乡的高家少爷在桦树林里与扮作村姑的樊家小姐相遇，一见钟情。高、樊两家互相傲视，使得他们只能暗中约会。偶然的事件使两家老人握手言和，一对恋人在爱情又经过一番戏剧性磨砺后，终结百年之好。
    将普希金的散文改编成中国古老的剧种昆剧，是北方昆曲剧院副院长郭启宏的一个大胆尝试，他认为昆曲最适于表达诗人的意境。
