Because of a malfunction in the liquid hydrogen circulation pump inside one of the main engines, the "Atlantis" space shuttle was forced to abort its launch 31 seconds before liftoff. Officials from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) stated that the earliest possible time for the next launch attempt would be between 2:07 PM and 2:50 PM on May 1.

The "Atlantis" was originally scheduled to launch at 2:24 PM today from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its primary mission was to send the "Magellan" spacecraft, valued at $380 million, into space to explore the surface of Venus. Due to the pump malfunction, which could not be resolved in time, the optimal 23-minute launch window was missed. Prior to this, technicians had resolved a minor computer glitch.

It is understood that the malfunctioning pump is located in the number one main engine at the rear of the shuttle. The circulation pumps (there are three in total) are responsible for using liquid hydrogen to cool the fuel lines of the three main engines, maintaining a suitable combustion temperature. Technicians will repair the problematic component over the next two days.

### 因主发动机故障  “亚特兰蒂斯”号停飞

　　因主发动机故障    
   “亚特兰蒂斯”号停飞
    本报华盛顿４月２８日电  记者仓立德报道：由于一个主发动机内的液态氢循环泵发生故障，“亚特兰蒂斯”号航天飞机在升空前３１秒钟时被迫停飞。美国航空航天局官员说，下次发射最早也得在５月１日下午２点零７分至２点５０分之间恢复。
    “亚特兰蒂斯”号原定于今天下午２时２４分后在佛罗里达州肯尼迪航天中心发射升空，主要任务是将价值３．８亿美元、用于勘探金星表面的“麦哲伦”号宇宙飞船送入太空。由于循环泵故障不能及时排除，显然错过２３分钟的最佳发射时间。此前技术人员曾排除了一个计算机小故障。
    据悉，发生故障的循环泵位于航天飞机后部的一号主发动机。循环泵（共３个）的作用是用液态氢来冷却３个主发动机的燃料管道，以保持一定的发火温度。技术人员将于明后两天检修有问题的零部件。
