		Archaeological experts have recently determined that the astronomy chart discovered nine years ago in the late Tang Dynasty tomb of the Water-Qiu family in Lin'an County, Zhejiang Province, is the earliest complete star map found in China to date. It predates the world-renowned earliest complete star map, the Suzhou Star Chart, by over 300 years.

		Water-Qiu was the mother of King Qian Liu of the Wuyue Kingdom. Her tomb was discovered in July 1980. On the ceiling of the rear chamber of the tomb, a complete map of the 28 lunar mansions and the Big Dipper is painted on the lime layer. The chart includes 185 stars, with 168 stars representing the 28 lunar mansions and the Big Dipper, and 17 stars representing 8 additional constellations. The stars are square-shaped, ranging from 1 to 2 centimeters in width, and are made of gold foil. Stars within the same constellation are connected by red lines. The stars on the ceiling are divided into three concentric elliptical lines. In the center-south of the ceiling, there is a painted lotus flower with multiple layers of petals. The stars are arranged in an elliptical pattern around the lotus flower, following the three lines. To the southeast of the stars, there is a painted red sun with a diameter of 12.5 centimeters.

    新华社杭州５月２４日电  （记者何玲玲）考古专家最近经鉴定认为，９年前在浙江临安县晚唐水邱氏墓中发现的天文图，是我国迄今发现的最早的完整星像图，它比世界公认的最早的完整天文图——苏州石刻星图，还要早３００多年。
    水邱氏是吴越国王钱镠之母，她的墓穴于１９８０年７月被发现。在墓的后室顶部石灰层表面，绘有一幅完整的２８宿和北斗的天文图，共有星星１８５颗，其中２８宿和北斗１６８颗，附属星座８座１７颗。星呈方形，宽１至２厘米，用金箔贴成，同一星座的星星都用红线相联。墓顶星图之间，分出三重椭圆线圈。墓顶中心偏南处有一朵彩绘重瓣莲花，星星以莲花为中心，顺着三条线圈作椭圆形分布。在星的东南方，还有一轮直径１２．５厘米的彩绘红日。
