Syrian forces and their Lebanese Muslim militia allies exchanged artillery fire with Christian government troops outside Beirut last night. Today, they launched a heavy assault on the northern coastal area of Beirut, putting the three-day ceasefire in jeopardy of collapse.

A source from Lebanon's security department said the escalation of the war threatens the plan of the Arab League to send peacekeeping forces to Lebanon.

According to reports, the latest outbreak of fighting was triggered by disagreements between the Muslim and Christian combatants over a key clause in the ceasefire agreement: lifting the blockade on all ports, roads, and airports.

    贝鲁特城外重开炮战
    新华社贝鲁特５月１日电  叙利亚军队及其支持的黎巴嫩穆斯林民兵在贝鲁特城外同基督教政府军相互炮击一夜后，今天又向贝鲁特北部沿海发动猛攻，致使持续了３天的停火处于崩溃的危险之中。
    黎巴嫩保安部门一位人士说，战争的升级威胁到了阿拉伯联盟向黎巴嫩派遣维持和平部队的计划。
    据报道，最新爆发的炮战是由于穆斯林和基督教交战双方在停火协议的关键条款：解除对所有港口、道路和机场的封锁，存在分歧而引起的。
