Some students in the capital's universities continued their hunger strike at Tiananmen Square yesterday, entering the third day. It is understood that over a thousand students have participated in the hunger strike at Tiananmen Square, with many onlookers gathered around. About a hundred people fainted on the square. These individuals were immediately given medical assistance.

Leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and relevant departments, as well as leaders from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the municipal government, and relevant departments, have shown great concern over the students' hunger strike. On the morning of May 15, Li Tieying, Yan Mingfu, and leaders from relevant departments held a dialogue with some students at the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Hall. During the dialogue, leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and relevant departments repeatedly urged the students not to engage in the hunger strike, but their efforts were unsuccessful.

Over the past three days, leaders and teachers from some universities have gone to Tiananmen Square to persuade the students to cherish their health and return to school. There have also been people continuously going to the square to support the students.

Yesterday afternoon, intellectuals from the capital marched to Tiananmen Square to express their support for the university students who were on hunger strike.

Yan Jiaqi, Bao Zunxin, Ke Yunlu, Wang Luzhang, and others led the march, carrying a banner with the words "Chinese Intellectuals." The march included professors, lecturers, researchers from over 60 units such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Peking University, and Tsinghua University, as well as doctors, masters, and staff, totaling approximately tens of thousands of people. They held banners with slogans such as "Support the Students, Promote Reform" and "Fair Evaluation," and chanted slogans like "Students Love the Country, I Love the Students" as they marched.

Around 4 PM, the march entered Tiananmen Square, and by around 7 PM, the support group gradually dispersed. Additionally, a "rescue team" composed of medical staff from the Peking Union Medical College also arrived at the square.
