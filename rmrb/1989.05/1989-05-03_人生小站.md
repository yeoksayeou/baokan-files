Title: A Moment in Life

In a countryside station bathed in moonlight,
Two trains pass each other, side by side.
The tracks separate them forever.
The whistle blows,
The driver salutes a stranger in the same profession.
They know: such an encounter
Happens only once.

In a spring afternoon,
You and I walk towards each other.
The gentle breeze plays with your hair, as if it were clouds.
The willow catkins seem to fall just for you.
Just as I am about to say, "Hello,"
I see a pair of downcast eyes, a heart that is closed.
A voice becomes the track of my heart,
It can only follow, without crossing over:
Since meeting means parting,
The best way is not to speak.
Let time wash away our feelings, making them more blurred.
We only leave behind our shared sun.

　　人生小站
    北京医科大学  贾丹
    在一个洒满月光的乡间小站
    两列火车相对开来，交臂而过
    铁轨隔开了永恒的距离
    汽笛响起
    司机在向陌生的同行致意
    他们知道：这样的相逢
    只有一次
    在一个春的午后
    迎面走着你和我
    柔风抚弄着你的发，以为是云
    柳絮也像是为它而飘落
    刚要问声“你好”
    却看见一双低垂的目，一颗关闭的心
    一个声音喊成了我心的轨道
    它只能遵守，无法跨越：
    既然相逢意味着分别
    最好的办法是不要开口
    把感受交给时光漂洗得更朦胧
    只留下我们共同的太阳
