Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th.

The State Council and the Central Military Commission recently approved new methods for the Navy and Air Force to recruit aviation cadets starting this year.

Currently, the Navy and Air Force are conducting recruitment work for new aviation cadets in relevant provinces and cities.

The new method for recruiting aviation cadets is to include this work in the national unified enrollment plan for ordinary higher education institutions. Each year, the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Public Security, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army will jointly deploy the work, with the Navy and Air Force organizing and implementing it separately, and local units responsible for recruiting aviation cadets providing assistance.

According to relevant officials, in the past, the Navy and Air Force recruited aviation cadets through the military and local governments. The reform of the recruitment process began in 1987 with pilot projects. The State Council and the Central Military Commission affirmed the experience gained from these pilot projects.

　　招收飞行学员有新法
  　今年起纳入普通高校招生计划
    新华社北京５月１３日电（通讯员孙国强、记者蔡善武）国务院、中央军委最近批准海军、空军从今年起按新办法招收飞行学员。
    目前，海军、空军招收新飞行学员的工作已在有关省、市展开。
    招收飞行学员的新办法是：将这项工作纳入国家普通高等学校统一招生计划，每年由国家教委、公安部、解放军总政治部统一部署，由海、空军分别组织实施，地方承担招收飞行学员任务的单位予以协助。
    据有关方面负责人介绍，我国海、空军过去招收飞行学员均由人武部门和地方政府负责。改革招飞的工作从１９８７年开始试点。国务院、中央军委肯定了试点的经验。
