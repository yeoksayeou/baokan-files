Title: Bush's Economic Policies Face a Test

President Bush recently spoke at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce annual meeting. The core of his speech was to reduce the federal government's fiscal deficit domestically, encourage business investment, and reform the savings and loan system; internationally, he proposed the "Brady Plan" to ease the international debt crisis and seek an "open and fair" international trade system. How these principles will be specifically implemented is undoubtedly a focus of attention both domestically and internationally.

Reducing the federal government's fiscal deficit is the "top priority" economic issue for the Bush administration. First, because the high and persistent fiscal deficit is increasingly becoming the most harmful unstable factor in the U.S. economy; second, because Congress has legislated that the budget deficit must be reduced annually over the next five years until it is completely eliminated by 1993. Against this backdrop, the Bush administration reached an agreement with Congress in April to reduce the 1990 fiscal deficit to below the statutory $100 billion level. The methods are essentially twofold: increasing revenue and cutting expenditures. The economic community here generally praises the Bush administration's decisive action, but some express varying degrees of doubt about its feasibility, as the envisioned deficit level is based on optimistic economic estimates.

Another point emphasized by Bush is encouraging business investment. The specific plans are as follows: first, proposing to reduce the capital gains tax from the current 30% to 15%; second, agreeing to increase the minimum wage, but insisting that it can only increase to $4.25 per hour over three years. In Bush's view, if the minimum wage increases too much, it will inevitably increase the cost of labor for businesses, leading to layoffs or passing on the increased costs to consumers, ultimately resulting in increased pressure on inflation and hindering economic development; third, reiterating "no new taxes." However, Congress's stance on the first two proposals is at odds with Bush's. Most Democratic lawmakers strongly oppose reducing the capital gains tax, arguing that this only benefits the rich. As for the minimum wage, Democrats advocate increasing it to $4.65 per hour. It seems that both sides will need to negotiate on these two issues to reach a compromise. On the issue of "no new taxes," Bush, like Reagan when he first took office, is unyielding. Bush believes that low tax rates can create conditions for continued economic growth, and as long as the economy develops, government revenue will naturally increase. However, it is noteworthy that some supply-side economists who previously strongly opposed tax increases recently urged Bush to accept "increasing gasoline taxes" in exchange for Congress agreeing to reduce the capital gains tax. Facing Congress's resistance and conservative lobbying, it remains to be seen whether Bush can maintain his stance on "no new taxes."

In terms of external economic relations, the Bush administration proposed the so-called "Brady Plan" in March, aimed at easing the international debt crisis. Although this plan has been welcomed by creditor countries and debtor countries, creditor banks have yet to take concrete actions. It now appears that the "Brady Plan," like the "Baker Plan" when it was first introduced, is still "all talk and no action."

As for foreign trade, Bush stated that the United States will strive to maintain an "open and fair" global trade system, on the one hand, working to dismantle foreign trade barriers, and on the other hand, continuing to keep the U.S. domestic market open. A recent signal is that the U.S. Trade Representative warned Japan on April 28 that if Japan does not open its telecommunications market, the United States will retaliate. The same day, this representative also issued a report listing unfair trade barriers set up by Japan, the European Community, Canada, and Brazil, among others, and stated that if these countries and regions do not agree to remove the barriers by 1994, the United States will decide on retaliatory actions against them by the end of this month. These signs indicate that, given the difficult situation of U.S. trade balance this year, the Bush administration may take a hardline stance against "unfair trade" by other countries.

In summary, the characteristics of Bush's economic policies are pragmatic, with less theoretical color, which is clearly different from Reagan's "Economic Recovery Plan" and "Reaganomics" proposed in 1981. The main goal of Bush's economic policies is to take measures to continue the economic growth that has lasted for 77 months. However, some recently released economic indicators show that the momentum of the U.S. economy is weakening, and the pressure of inflation has not eased. To achieve both low inflation and avoid recession, Bush's economic policies are obviously facing a severe test.

### 布什经济政策面临考验

　　布什经济政策面临考验
    本报记者  张亮
    布什总统日前在美国商会年会上发表讲话，其核心内容是，对内削减联邦政府的财政赤字，鼓励企业投资和整顿储贷系统；对外提出减缓国际债务危机的“布雷迪计划”以及寻求“开放与公平”的国际贸易体系。这些原则性的大政方针将如何具体付诸实施，无疑为国内外所瞩目。
    削减联邦政府的财政赤字是布什政府“最优先考虑”的经济问题。一是因为居高难下的财政赤字越来越成为美国经济中危害最大的不稳定因素；二是由于国会立法规定今后５年内必须逐年削减预算赤字，直至１９９３年全部消灭。在此背景下，布什政府已于４月间同国会达成协议，将１９９０年度的预算赤字减至低于法定１０００亿美元的水平。其办法不外乎两种，即开源与节流。此间经济界对布什政府的这一果断行动普遍表示赞赏，但也有人对其可行性表示不同程度的怀疑，因为设想的赤字水平是基于对经济的乐观估计。
    布什强调的另外一点是鼓励企业投资。其具体方案是：第一，提议将资本收益税从现行的３０％减至１５％；第二，同意增加最低工资，但坚持３年内最高只能增到每小时４．２５美元。在布什看来，如果最低工资增长过多，势必使企业劳动成本提高，从而导致企业解雇工人或将成本提高部分转嫁给消费者，最终结果只能是加大对通货膨胀的压力和阻碍经济发展；第三，再次重申“不征新税”。但是，国会对前两项方案的立场与布什相悖。多数民主党议员强烈反对削减资本收益税，认为这只对富人有利。至于最低工资，民主党人主张增至每小时４．６５美元。看来，双方在这两个问题上要达成妥协，还需一番讨价还价。在“不征新税”问题上，布什与里根刚上台时一样毫不松口。布什认为，低税率可以为经济继续增长创造条件，只要经济发展了，政府的税入就会自然随之增加。但是，引人注目的是，一些过去坚决反对增税的供应学派经济学家最近当面敦促布什接受“增加汽油税”，以换取国会同意削减资本收益税。面对国会的阻力和保守派的游说，布什“不征新税”的立场能否坚持到底看来还是个问号。
    在对外经济关系方面，布什政府在３月间已提出一项旨在减缓国际债务危机的所谓“布雷迪计划”。这项计划虽受到债权国政府和债务国的欢迎，但债权银行至今迟迟不见实际行动。现在看来，“布雷迪计划”同“贝克计划”当年出台之时一样，依旧是“雷声大、雨点小”。
    至于对外贸易，布什表示美国将致力于维护一种“开放和公平”的世界贸易体系，一方面努力拆除国外的贸易壁垒，另一方面继续保持美国国内市场的开放。最近的一个信号是，美国贸易代表４月２８日已警告日本，如果日本不开放其通讯市场，美国将予以报复。这位代表同日还发表一份报告，列举了日本、欧共体、加拿大和巴西等一些国家和地区设置的不公平贸易壁垒，并声称，如果这些国家和地区不答应在１９９４年之前消除壁垒，美国将在本月底决定对其采取报复行动。这些迹象表明，在今年美国贸易收支状况难以明显改观的情况下，布什政府可能将对别国的“不公平贸易”采取强硬行动。
    综上所述，布什经济政策的特点是注重实际，理论色彩少，这与里根１９８１年上台时提出“经济复兴计划”和“里根经济学”有明显的不同。布什经济政策的主要目标是如何采取措施使已经持续了７７个月的经济增长继续下去。然而，官方最近公布的一些经济指标显示，美国经济的增长势头正在减弱，而通货膨胀的压力并未减轻。要做到既保持低通货膨胀又避免衰退，对布什的经济政策来说显然是一个严峻的考验。
