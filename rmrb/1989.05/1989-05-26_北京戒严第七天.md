Beijing Under Martial Law for the Seventh Day

Yesterday, the atmosphere in Beijing was calm. There were no protest marches on the streets. Under the scorching heat, with temperatures reaching up to 36°C, many students on Tiananmen Square moved to the shade of the trees in front of the Great Hall of the People and the Museum of Chinese History. The more than 100 large buses that had been providing shelter for the fasting students earlier had all but disappeared by the afternoon, with only one remaining on the square, the rest having returned to regular service.

At Beijing Railway Station, large numbers of students from outside the city were lining up to return home, with fewer new arrivals. A station official said they had prepared special trains or carriages to help disperse the students returning to their respective provinces.

Reports from some universities indicated that many students, exhausted from days of petitioning, had returned to their campuses. Some even returned to school in the early morning and returned to the square in the evening.

Tourism officials reported a significant drop in the number of tourist groups and visiting relatives from Taiwan in recent days. Some hotel managers complained about the slow business.

The martial law troops stationed outside the city began receiving visiting delegations from various levels of government. Some soldiers also held gatherings with local residents. According to a report by a Xinhua News Agency correspondent, the martial law troops stationed in Daxing County were gradually gaining the understanding of the local people. An officer said they wanted to present a disciplined and dignified military image to the people of the capital.

    本报北京５月２７日凌晨讯  昨日北京全城气氛平静。
    街上没有出现游行队伍。在最高达３６℃的酷热气温下，天安门广场上的许多学生纷纷转移到人民大会堂和历史博物馆前的树荫里。前些时候提供给绝食学生避雨的一百多辆大客车，到下午只剩一辆停在广场，其余全部开走投入运营。
    北京火车站前，大量外地进京学生排队等待返回，新来的学生已经不多了。车站一位负责人说，他们已准备了一些专列或车厢，供疏散返回各地的学生们使用。
    来自部分大学的消息表明，不少连日请愿疲惫不堪的学生已返回学校，其中也有人清晨回校，傍晚重返广场。
    旅游部门人士称，近日来京旅游团组和探亲台胞人数锐减，一些旅游饭店经理抱怨生意清淡。
    尚在城外整休待命的戒严部队，开始接待各级政府组织的慰问队伍。有些官兵还与当地居民联欢。据新华社记者在一篇报道中反映，驻在大兴县的戒严部队正逐步为群众理解，一位军官说，他们想以严整的军容军姿出现在首都人民面前。
