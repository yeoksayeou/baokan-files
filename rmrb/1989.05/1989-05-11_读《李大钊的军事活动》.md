	Reading "Li Dazhao's Military Activities"
	Fu Ligun

	People know that armed struggle is the main theme of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. However, previous propaganda and research on the history of our party's armed struggle have mainly focused on the 22 years after 1927. As for the party's early military work, it has long been overlooked. In fact, soon after the party was founded, some famous communists had already begun extensive and in-depth work on the military front. The military activities carried out by Comrade Li Dazhao and the party's Northern Bureau he led are a notable part of this. Due to certain subjective reasons in the past, the history of the party's early military work has been virtually absent from our propaganda and research. Posterity knows only of Li Dazhao's great achievements in other areas, with little knowledge of his position and contributions in the development of our party's armed struggle. Xiaoyu Sheng's new book "Li Dazhao's Military Activities" (published by the Military Science Press) introduces Li Dazhao's achievements in military activities. This will undoubtedly play a role in promoting the research on the history of the party's early military work.

	As a systematic introduction to Li Dazhao's military activities, the book uses rich historical materials to comprehensively and vividly describe how Comrade Li Dazhao explored and propagated Marxist-Leninist military theory, initiated the party's military work in the northern region, created and developed revolutionary armed forces under the party's control or influence, assisted Feng Yuxiang and Guo Songling in their revolutionary tendencies, supported the Northern Expeditionary Army's operations in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, promoted Feng Yuxiang's return to the country to respond to the Northern Expedition, guided the reorganization of the National Army, established a united front against the Fengtian clique in the north, supported the Northern Expeditionary Army's advance into Central China, and the historical impact and influence of these activities. At the same time, using Li Dazhao's military activities as the main thread and the political landscape of China in the 1920s before the failure of the Great Revolution as the background, the book also introduces a series of major events at that time and the important military activities of many important members of our party in the early days.

　　读《李大钊的军事活动》
    傅立群
    人们知道，武装斗争是中国新民主主义革命的主旋律。可是，以往有关我党武装斗争史的宣传与研究，主要限于一九二七年以后的二十二年。至于党的早期军事工作，则长期湮闻于世。其实，建党之后不久，一些著名共产党人便已开始在军事战线进行大量深入的工作。李大钊同志及其领导的党的北方区委当年所从事的军事活动，就是其中卓有成效的一个部分。只是由于过去某些主观原因，党的早期军事工作史况在我们的宣传研究中基本上属于一个空白；对李大钊烈士，后人只晓得他在其它方面的丰功伟业，甚少知道他在我党武装斗争发展史上的地位与贡献。肖裕声同志的新著《李大钊的军事活动》（军事科学出版社出版）一书，介绍了李大钊在军事活动方面的业绩。这对拓展党的早期军事工作史研究无疑会起到推动作用。
    该书作为一部系统介绍李大钊军事活动的专著，它以丰富的史料，对大钊烈士当年探讨和宣传马列军事理论，开辟党在北方地区的军事工作、创建和发展由我党掌握或影响的革命武装，帮助冯玉祥、郭松龄等倾向革命，策应北伐军在两湖和江西的作战，促成冯玉祥回国响应北伐，指导整顿国民军，建立北方反奉军事统一战线，策应北伐军挥戈中原，以及这些活动所产生的历史作用与影响等，做了全面而翔实的叙述。同时，以李大钊的军事活动为经，以大革命失败前中国二十年代政治舞台风云为纬，对当时国内一系列重大事件及我党早期一大批重要成员在当时的许多重要军事活动，也做了介绍。
