The invited guests believed that as long as measures are appropriate, the problem can be properly solved.

PENG ZHEN, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, invited non-Communist Party vice chairmen of the National People's Congress Standing Committee for a talk on May 26 in the afternoon and delivered an important speech (the full text will be published separately).

Peng Zhen pointed out in his speech that the motive of this student parade is good, pure, kind, and constructive. The purpose is to overcome the shortcomings and mistakes in the work, to make the state's affairs and socialist cause better, which is consistent with our requirements. However, the methods and means they adopted are not quite appropriate. They are not familiar with or not very familiar with the law. They lack political experience and are not vigilant enough against the evil intentions of a very few conspirators and bad guys who take advantage of the situation to create turmoil. We old comrades have the responsibility to help them and remind them. He stressed that we must take facts as the basis and the Constitution and laws as the criterion to unify our thinking. Peng Zhen elaborated on the relevant constitutional and legal provisions.

The seven vice chairmen who attended the talk were: Zhu Lianfan, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Fei Xiaotong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Sun Qimeng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Lei Jieqiong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League for Self-Improvement and Progress; Zhou Guocheng, Honorary Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Yan Jizi, Honorary Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League for Self-Improvement and Progress; and Rong Yiren, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. In their speeches, they expressed deep concern about the current situation and agreed with Peng Zhen's proposal to unify thinking on the basis of facts and the Constitution and laws. They said that the democratic parties have long cooperated with the Communist Party of China, weathering storms together. Today, Peng Zhen invited us to talk and briefed us on the relevant important situation, which further embodies the Communist Party's relationship of mutual trust with the democratic parties and embodies the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party.

Everyone believes that based on decades of personal experience, without the leadership of the Communist Party, China's affairs cannot be well managed. The democratic parties share weal and woe with the Communist Party. When the Communist Party encounters difficulties, it is also our difficulty. When the Communist Party is good, the country has a future. No one wants to see a hopeful China turn into a hopeless, chaotic China, which is not good for anyone. At this critical moment, our country must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of China. All democratic parties should further strengthen cooperation with the Communist Party and must work together with the Communist Party to stabilize the situation and solve problems in the track of democracy and the rule of law.

Some comrades also put forward some hopes and suggestions: it is necessary to fully affirm and resolutely protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of students. Their reasonable demands on many major issues are consistent with the goals that the Communist Party and the people's government are striving to achieve, and should be seriously dealt with; it is necessary to distinguish between a very few people and the vast majority, mobilize all positive factors, and unite the majority; it is necessary to do a good job in all aspects and restore social order as soon as possible.

They sincerely hope that students will return to school and resume classes as soon as possible; they hope to further strengthen the construction of socialist democratic politics, increase transparency, and seriously improve the work of the party and the government, and timely handle various problems. Everyone expressed their belief in the Communist Party and their insistence on socialism. As long as the measures are appropriate, the current problems can definitely be properly solved.

Peng Zhen said in conclusion that several old comrades all spoke, and everyone put forward many good opinions, all for the sake of doing things well. I will say three more sentences: First, the "facts as the basis, laws as the criterion" I mentioned this time is used to unify thinking. Second, we must adhere to the rule of law and not engage in personal rule. No one can have privileges that exceed the Constitution and laws. I hope everyone will use the Constitution and laws to regulate their actions, and the problems raised by the masses should be solved through the track of democracy and the rule of law, in a pragmatic and calm manner. Third, we should cherish the students. I hope everyone will think of more ways and do more work to make the students and the masses of all sides unite around the party and the government, stop the turmoil, restore order, improve work, overcome difficulties, and do a good job in the country's affairs.

CPC Central Political Bureau member Ding Guan'gen, and Central Secretariat member and head of the United Front Work Department Yan Mingfu attended the talk.

　　受中共中央委托
    彭真邀请党外副委员长座谈
    发表重要讲话阐述有关宪法和法律规定
    被邀人士认为只要措施得当问题定能得到妥善解决
    新华社北京５月２９日电　彭真同志受中共中央委托，于５月２６日下午邀请全国人大常委会副委员长中的民主党派、工商联负责人座谈。彭真同志在座谈会上作了重要讲话（全文另发）。
    彭真同志在讲话中指出，这次学生游行的动机是好的、纯洁的、善良的、建设性的，目的是为了克服工作中的缺点失误，把国家的事情、社会主义事业办得更好，这同我们的要求是一致的。但是，他们所采取的手段、方式不大妥当。他们对法律不熟悉或不很熟悉。他们缺乏政治经验，对极少数极少数阴谋家、坏人，乘机制造动乱的险恶用心警惕不够。我们这些老同志有责任帮助他们，提醒他们。他强调，必须以事实为根据，以宪法和法律为准绳来统一思想。彭真同志就有关的宪法和法律规定作了阐述。
    参加座谈会的７位副委员长是：民革中央主席朱学范、民盟中央主席费孝通、民建中央主席孙起孟、民进中央主席雷洁琼、农工党中央名誉主席周谷城、九三学社中央名誉主席严济慈、全国工商联主席荣毅仁。他们在发言中对当前的局势深表忧虑，赞同彭真同志提出的以事实为依据，以宪法和法律为准绳来统一思想。他们说，民主党派同中国共产党长期合作，风雨同舟，今天彭真同志邀请我们座谈通报了有关重要情况，进一步体现了共产党同民主党派肝胆相照的关系，体现了共产党领导的多党合作制度。
    大家认为，根据几十年来的切身体会，没有共产党的领导，中国的事情就办不好。民主党派同共产党荣辱与共，共产党遇到困难，也就是我们的困难，共产党好了，国家就有前途。大家都不愿意看到一个有希望的中国变成没有希望、乱糟糟的中国，这样对谁都没有好处。在当前的重要时刻，我们国家必须坚持中国共产党的领导，各民主党派要进一步加强同共产党的合作，一定要同舟共济，和共产党站在一起做工作，稳定局势，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。
    有些同志还提出了一些希望和建议：必须充分肯定并且坚决保护广大学生的爱国热情，他们对许多重大问题提出的合理要求，同共产党和人民政府努力实现的目标是一致的，要认真对待；要把极少数极少数人和绝大多数人区别开来，调动一切积极因素，团结大多数；要做好各方面的工作，尽快恢复社会的正常秩序。
    他们殷切希望学生尽快返校复课；希望进一步加强社会主义民主政治建设，增加透明度，认真改进党和政府的工作，及时处理好各方面的问题。大家表示要相信共产党，要坚持社会主义，只要措施得当，当前的问题一定能够得到妥善解决。
    彭真同志最后说，几位老同志都讲了话，大家提了很多很好的意见，都是为了把事情办好。我再讲三句话：一是，我这次讲的“以事实为根据，以法律为准绳”，是用来统一思想的。二是，一定要坚持法制，不能搞人治，任何人都不能有超越宪法和法律的特权，希望每个人都用宪法和法律来规范自己的行动，群众提出的问题都要通过民主和法制的轨道，实事求是、平心静气地商议解决。三是，要爱护学生，希望大家再想些办法，做些工作，使学生和各方面的群众一道，团结在党和政府的周围，制止动乱，恢复秩序，改进工作，克服困难，把国家的事情办好。
    中共中央政治局候补委员丁关根，中央书记处书记、中央统战部部长阎明复参加了座谈。
