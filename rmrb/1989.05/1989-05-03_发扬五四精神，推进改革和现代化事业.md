Our country's reform and socialist modernization construction are at a crucial juncture, and we are also celebrating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. At this moment, our hearts are stirred, and our thoughts are numerous.

Reflecting on the achievements of the May Fourth pioneers in their relentless struggle to save China, and revisiting the rich thoughts of the May Fourth Movement that promoted China's social progress, we draw spiritual strength from them. This strength is crucial for us to firm up our resolve for reform, overcome difficulties and obstacles, and mobilize all ethnic groups in the country to work together to advance the modernization cause.

The May Fourth Movement, which erupted 70 years ago, was not an accident. On one hand, the oppression of imperialism, the darkness of society, and the corruption of the Beiyang warlord government had reached an unbearable level, and the country was facing the danger of extinction. Therefore, people from all walks of life in China unanimously demanded an end to this miserable fate. On the other hand, the enlightenment of modern civilization had already made the progressive intellectuals in China reflect deeply and awaken. Everyone deeply felt that without change, there would be no way to achieve self-improvement and self-strengthening. Thus, this patriotic democratic movement inevitably erupted. Under the influence of the May Fourth Movement and the victory of the October Revolution, the Communist Party of China was born two years later. The modern patriotic democratic movement opened a new chapter. In Chinese history, there has never been a time when the people's thoughts were so self-aware and united, and no force could shake the Chinese people's firm resolve to save and transform China. As Mao Zedong said in "On New Democracy": "The outstanding historical significance of the May Fourth Movement lies in its having brought about a new situation in which the Chinese people, for the first time in history, were able to take a stand against imperialism and feudalism in a thorough and uncompromising manner." It can be said that the May Fourth Movement opened the way for the modernization movement and, for the first time in modern China, fully demonstrated the Chinese people's strong desire and firm belief in national liberation, social progress, and the advancement of modernization.

The past is gone. Seventy years later, China is both a country that has achieved complete independence and embarked on the socialist path, and a country facing more extensive, deeper, and more arduous tasks of social transformation. How can we completely rid ourselves of poverty and backwardness, build a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist country, and make the Chinese nation rejuvenate and quickly join the ranks of modern nations? This is the new chapter that history requires us to write. Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "For China to develop, it must adhere to opening up to the outside world and reforming internally. Reform includes the reform of the political system in the superstructure." Undoubtedly, the modernization movement that began 70 years ago provides us with rich experience and enlightenment.

A clear and fervent patriotism has always been the spiritual force that inspires and guides us to forge ahead. The May Fourth pioneers not only inherited the patriotic tradition of the Chinese nation formed over thousands of years but also elevated this patriotism to a new height. They no longer indulged in the self-admiration of "ancient civilization" but opened their eyes to face reality and sought survival and development through change. Compared to 70 years ago, the times have changed, and the political, economic, and social conditions have also changed. If, 70 years ago, this patriotism was manifested in the struggle to save the nation and destroy an old world to save China; today, it is concentrated in the arduous struggle to adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, and achieve the Four Modernizations, revitalize China, and build a new China. Our country is still far from being free from poverty and backwardness and is facing new challenges. If we cannot seize the opportunity, reform, and strive to catch up, China will find it difficult to stand firm in the future. At this critical juncture, the reform needs the great support of the spiritual power of patriotism. Without the understanding and support of the people, reform cannot succeed. Therefore, we must explain to the people the situation our country is facing, especially the difficulties it encounters, so that everyone, while sharing the fruits of reform, also shares the difficulties of the country. The rectification and rectification we are currently carrying out to promote and deepen reform is necessary. We will not retreat, nor can we retreat. As long as we reach a national consensus on such issues, we can unite and work together, and firmly advance along the path of reform and opening up, gradually moving towards modernization.

May Fourth was also an unprecedented new cultural movement. The banner of science and democracy raised by this new cultural movement is a powerful weapon for us to advance reform and the modernization cause. In history, any social transformation movement is always preceded by a revolution in thought, and the May Fourth Movement is no exception. After painful reflections on China's history and reality, the May Fourth pioneers drew the conclusion that if the "Confucian shop" was not overthrown and the shackles of old culture were not broken, not only could the trend of China's decline not be reversed, but the tragic historical fate could never be changed. It was on this basis that the progressive intellectuals who were ahead of the times spontaneously gathered under the two banners of science and democracy. It can be said that without the enlightenment of the new ideas of science and democracy, there would not have been the later spread and development of Marxism in China, and the victory of decisive significance. This precious historical experience still has practical significance today.

Upholding the banner of science helps us better adhere to the thought line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts. In a socialist country, how to achieve modernization is a brand-new topic. Historical experience tells us that starting from the book and from concepts can only lead to dogmatism and rigidity. Only by emancipating the mind, combining theory with practice, innovating, and observing and solving problems with a scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, can we promote China's progress and development. The current problem is not that there is too much scientific spirit, but that the scientific spirit has not been greatly promoted. There are still people who are used to binding themselves with old rules and regulations, who cannot tolerate or understand new things, new experiences, and new methods that have been proven correct by practice. There are also people who, regardless of China's actual situation, always want to copy this or that foreign model. These do not conform to the spirit of science and are obstacles to reform and progress. Therefore, we must continue to adhere to the thought line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts proposed by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, vigorously advocate the spirit of science, free ourselves from various superstitions and dogmas, and work hard to open up a path of socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics.

Promoting democracy, advancing democratic politics, and actively and prudently advancing political system reform are important components of the modernization cause. Building democratic politics is not just about talking, but about doing practical work. Over the past decade of reform, the Party and the government have done a lot of work to promote democratic politics: gradually improving the system of people's congresses to better reflect the people's participation in politics and management of state affairs; opening up multiple channels for broad democratic consultation and dialogue; using various forms of social supervision to strengthen anti-corruption efforts; and making progress in legal construction aimed at ensuring democracy, etc. Of course, we cannot be satisfied with this. We still need to continue to do solid work and make steady progress. Political system reform is a very complex task that requires consideration of various conditions and factors, the most important of which is to have a stable political environment. Without this prerequisite, nothing can be done well.

The May Fourth Movement was a great youth movement. The spirit of change and self-sacrifice shown by Chinese youth in this patriotic democratic movement was awe-inspiring and moving, and it was a brilliant page. Whether it was the May Fourth Movement or the subsequent Chinese revolution and construction, it proved a truth: youth is the generation most eager to accept new things. At the critical moment of social change, with the correct guidance of thought, youth always stands at the forefront and becomes a real vanguard. The youth of the 1980s, under the leadership of the Party, are still playing such a role. Therefore, we should encourage youth to care about national affairs and actively participate in various reform undertakings. Of course, youth also has its shortcomings, such as lack of experience, not considering problems comprehensively, and sometimes not being calm enough, but as long as we guide them correctly and explain the reasons, youth can understand the great cause and consider the overall situation. We should understand, protect, and mobilize their enthusiasm, while also strictly demanding and encouraging them to inherit and develop the fine traditions of their predecessors. This is the true love for youth and is an attitude of seeking truth from facts.

May Fourth is the youth's festival. At this time, we especially miss Comrade Hu Yaobang, who made great contributions to the youth movement in our country. Young people should learn from his noble character, closely unite around the Party, have ideals, observe discipline, study diligently, work hard, strive for progress, and work hard. With their wisdom and work achievements, they will create brilliant achievements that are worthy of their predecessors, the people, and the times.

### 发扬五四精神，推进改革和现代化事业

　　发扬五四精神，推进改革和现代化事业
    我国的改革和社会主义现代化建设事业正进入一个关键性时刻，又迎来了五四运动７０周年纪念日。此时，我们心潮起伏，思绪万千。
    缅怀五四先驱者们为拯救中国前仆后继、英勇奋斗的业绩，重温五四推动中国社会进步的丰富思想，从中汲取精神力量，并使之发扬光大，对于我们坚定改革的信念，克服前进中的困难和阻力，动员全国各族人民为推进现代化事业而同心同德地艰苦奋斗，有着十分重要的意义。
    ７０年前爆发的五四运动不是偶然的。一方面，帝国主义的侵略，社会的黑暗和北洋军阀政府的腐败已经到了忍无可忍的地步，国家面临着亡国灭种的危险，因此中国社会各阶层的人们一致要求结束这种悲惨的命运。另一方面，近代文明裹挟着思想的启蒙，已经使中国进步知识界有了痛切的反省和觉悟。大家深切地感到，非变革不能图自新图自强。于是这场爱国民主运动不可避免地爆发了。在五四的孕育下，在十月革命胜利的鼓舞下，两年后中国共产党诞生了。近代中国的爱国民主运动掀开了新的一页。在中国历史上，还没有哪个时代的人民群众能够达到这样的思想自觉和一致，没有任何力量可以摇撼中国人民拯救中国、改造中国的坚定决心。正如毛泽东在《新民主主义论》所说的那样：“五四运动的杰出的历史意义，在于它带着为辛亥革命还不曾有的姿态，这就是彻底地不妥协地反帝国主义和彻底地不妥协地反封建主义。”可以这样说，五四运动开现代化运动先河，在近代中国第一次充分显示了中国人民要求民族解放，社会进步，要求推进现代化的强烈渴望和坚定信念。
    往事已矣。７０年后的今天，中国既是一个实现了国家完全独立、走上了社会主义道路的中国，又是一个面临更为广泛、更为深刻、更为艰巨的社会变革任务的中国。怎样才能彻底摆脱贫困和落后，建设一个富强、民主、文明的社会主义国家，使中华民族焕发青春，尽快步入现代国家的行列，这是历史要求我们谱写的新篇章。邓小平同志指出：“中国要得到发展，必须坚持对外开放、对内改革。改革，包括上层建筑领域的政治体制的改革。”毫无疑问，７０年前开始的现代化运动，给我们提供了丰富的经验和启示。
    清醒而炽烈的爱国主义永远是激励和引导我们奋发前进的精神力量。五四先驱者们不仅继承了中华民族千百年来形成的爱国传统，而且把这种爱国主义精神提升到一个新的高度。他们不再沉湎于“古老文明”的自我欣赏之中，而是睁开双眼，面对现实，以变革求生存求发展。与７０年前相比，现在时代不同了，政治、经济、社会条件也不同了，如果说，这种爱国主义精神在７０年前表现在为救亡图存，打碎一个旧世界，拯救中国而斗争；在今天则集中体现在坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的总方针，为实现四化，振兴中华，建设一个新中国而进行的艰苦奋斗之中。我们的国家远未摆脱贫困和落后，又面临着新的挑战。如果不能把握机会，改革自强，急起直追，中国就很难在未来时代站稳脚跟。在这样的关口，改革需要爱国主义精神力量的巨大支持。没有人民的理解和支持改革是不能取得成功的。所以要把我们国家所面临的处境尤其是所遇到的困难向人民讲清楚，使每一个人在分享改革成果的同时，也要分担国家的困难。我们目前为推进和深化改革所进行的治理整顿是必要的。我们不会走回头路，也不能走回头路。只要我们在这样一些问题上达到全民共识，就能够上下一心，群策群力，坚定不移地沿着改革开放的道路走下去，逐步向现代化迈进。
    五四又是一场前所未有的新文化运动，这场新文化运动所高举的科学和民主的旗帜，是我们推进改革和现代化事业强有力的武器。历史上任何一次社会变革运动总是以思想革命为其先导，五四运动也是这样。五四先驱者们对中国的历史和现实作了痛苦的思考后，得出了这样的结论：如果不打倒孔家店，不冲破旧文化的束缚，非但不能扭转中国日趋没落的颓势，而且永远不能改变悲惨的历史命运。正是在这种认识的基础上，得风气之先的进步知识分子不约而同地汇聚到科学和民主这两面大旗下来。可以说，如果没有科学和民主新思想的启蒙，也就不会有后来的马克思主义在中国的传播和发展，并取得具有决定性意义的胜利。这条宝贵的历史经验至今仍具有现实意义。
    高举科学旗帜有助于我们更好地坚持解放思想、实事求是的思想路线。在社会主义国家，如何实现现代化是一个崭新的课题。历史经验告诉我们，从本本出发，从概念出发，只能导致教条和僵化。只有解放思想，理论联系实际，开拓创新，以实事求是的科学态度观察问题，解决问题，才能推动中国的进步和发展。现在的问题不是科学精神太多了，而是科学精神尚未大大发扬。仍有人习惯用旧的条条框框束缚自己的手脚，看不惯或不理解已被实践证明是正确的新事物、新经验、新办法。也有人不顾中国的实际情况，总想照搬这样那样的外国模式。这些都不符合科学的精神，是改革前进的障碍。因此，继续坚持党的十一届三中全会提出的解放思想，实事求是的思想路线，大力提倡科学精神，从形形色色的迷信和教条中解放出来，脚踏实地，艰苦奋斗，才可能走出一条有中国特色的社会主义现代化道路来。
    发扬民主，推进民主政治，积极慎重地推进政治体制改革，是现代化事业的一个重要组成部分。建设民主政治，不能光说空话，而是要多做脚踏实地的工作。改革１０年来，党和政府为推进民主政治做了大量工作：逐步完善了人民代表大会制度，使之更好地体现人民参政议政、管理国家大事的职能；开辟多种渠道，广泛进行民主协商对话；运用多种形式实行社会监督，加强廉政建设；旨在保障民主的法制建设有了进展，等等。当然，我们不能以此为满足。我们还要继续做扎扎实实的工作，稳步前进。政治体制改革是一项十分复杂的工作，要考虑到各种条件和因素，其中最重要的因素就是要有一个稳定的政治环境。没有这个前提条件，什么事情都办不好。
    五四是一场伟大的青年运动。我国青年在这场爱国民主运动中表现出来的变革意识和义无反顾的牺牲精神，惊天地、泣鬼神，是光彩夺目的一页。无论五四运动还是其后的中国革命和建设事业，都证明了一个真理：青年是最容易接受新鲜事物的一代。在社会变革的历史关头，有了正确思想的指导，青年总是站在前列，成为名副其实的生力军。８０年代的青年在党的领导下，仍然发挥着这样的作用。因此，要鼓励青年关心国家大事，积极参与各项改革事业。当然青年也是有不足的，比如经验不足，考虑问题不甚全面，有时不够冷静等，但只要我们正确引导，讲清楚道理，青年们是能够明大义，顾大局的。对青年要理解，要保护和调动他们的积极性，同时也要严格要求，鼓励他们继承和发展前辈的优良传统。这是真正的爱护青年，也是实事求是的态度。
    五四是青年的节日。在这个时候，我们格外怀念曾为我国青年运动作出巨大贡献的耀邦同志。青年们要学习他的高尚品格，紧密地团结在党的周围，有理想，守纪律，勤奋学习，辛勤劳动，奋发进取，艰苦奋斗，以自己的聪明才智和工作实绩，创造出无愧于前辈、无愧于人民和时代的光辉业绩。
