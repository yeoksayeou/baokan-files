Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 5th.

President Bush and West German Chancellor Kohl discussed their disagreements over short-range nuclear missiles over the phone today.

White House spokesman Fitzwater told reporters that Bush remains firm in his position, opposing negotiations with the Soviet Union on the reduction of short-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Bush advocates modernizing these missiles.

Fitzwater said that this phone conversation was initiated by Kohl because he "wants to confirm that he understands President Bush's position." Kohl supports negotiations with the Soviet Union to reduce short-range nuclear missiles.

Meanwhile, U.S. State Department spokesman Tatwiler said that Washington has proposed a solution to the short-range missile dispute to Bonn. She pointed out that although the proposal contains no new content, the Bush administration is willing to discuss ways to resolve the differences within NATO over the short-range missile issue.

As the NATO summit in Brussels is approaching, both Bush and Kohl hope to find a compromise solution to the short-range missile issue.

　　布什与科尔电话讨论短导分歧   
    双方希望找到折中解决办法
    新华社华盛顿５月５日电  美国总统布什和联邦德国总理科尔今天通过电话讨论了他们在短程核导弹问题上的分歧。
    白宫发言人菲茨沃特对记者说，布什仍然坚持他的立场，即不同意就削减欧洲短程核导弹同苏联谈判。布什主张使这种导弹现代化。
    菲茨沃特说，这次电话会谈是由科尔主动提出的，因为科尔“想肯定他是理解了布什总统的立场”。科尔支持同苏联谈判削减短程核导弹。
    与此同时，美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒说，华盛顿已就解决短导分歧向波恩提出一份建议。她指出，虽然建议中不包含任何新内容，但布什政府乐意讨论消除北约内部在短导问题上的分歧的办法。
    由于北约组织在布鲁塞尔召开的首脑会议临近，布什和科尔都希望就短导问题找到一个折中的解决办法。
