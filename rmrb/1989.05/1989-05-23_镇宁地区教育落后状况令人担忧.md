In early March, some members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference visited our county to investigate the state of ethnic minority education. They expressed deep concern over the educational conditions in these regions.

Firstly, there is a severe shortage of teachers, and their quality is low. For example, in the Buyi ethnic area of Liu Ma Mountain in our county, there are 66 primary schools with 211 teachers, averaging one teacher for every 294 students.

Secondly, the teaching staff is unstable. In 1982, 21 teachers were assigned to Liu Ma from normal schools, but all have since left. In 1984, 34 teachers were assigned, but only 2 remain. In 1985, 25 teachers were assigned, and only 1 remains. In 1986 and 1987, a total of 47 teachers were assigned, and 13 have already left Liu Ma. With such an unstable teaching staff, how can ethnic minority education develop?

Thirdly, the conditions for running schools are poor. In most primary and secondary schools in remote ethnic minority areas, the school buildings are dilapidated, with many dangerous structures, and there are not enough desks and chairs. Many schools have students bring their own desks and chairs, and some schools do not even have blackboards. Teaching materials and equipment are in short supply, and there are almost no sports and cultural facilities.

Fourthly, the school layout is unreasonable. In most remote ethnic minority areas, primary schools are run at the township level for grades one to three, and students must go to the district government's location for higher grades. All students commute, and the time spent traveling back and forth is much longer than the time spent in school. Parents spend money, and students suffer, but they do not gain much knowledge. This is a major reason for student dropout rates.

Fifthly, the enrollment rate for girls in remote ethnic minority areas is low. According to statistics from Liu Ma District, the number of female students in primary schools accounts for only about 20% of the school-age female population.

To change the backward state of education in remote ethnic minority areas, relevant departments should formulate special policies as soon as possible.

### 镇宁地区教育落后状况令人担忧

　　镇宁地区教育落后状况令人担忧
    ３月上旬，一些全国政协委员来我县考察民族教育情况，他们对少数民族地区的教育状况颇为担忧。
    一是师资严重不足，素质偏低。如我县布依族聚居的六马山区有小学６６所，现有教师２１１人，平均每个教师教２９４个学生。
    二是教师队伍不稳定。１９８２年从师范院校分到六马区的２１名教师，已全部调走了；１９８４年分去的３４名教师只剩下２人；１９８５年分去的２５名教师，剩了１人；１９８６年和１９８７年共分去４７名教师，现有１３人离开了六马区。教师队伍不稳定，民族教育如何能发展呢？
    三是办学条件差。边远少数民族地区大部分中小学的校舍破烂，危房甚多，缺桌少凳，不少学校的桌凳是学生自带的，有的学校连黑板也没有。教材教具更是奇缺，文体器材几乎没有。
    四是学校布局不合理。绝大多数边远少数民族地区、乡一级办初小一至三年级，上高小要到区政府所在地。学生全是走读，路上往返的时间大大超过在校读书的时间。家长花钱，学生辛苦，学不到知识。这是造成学生流失的重要原因。
    五是边远少数民族地区女孩子入学率低。据六马区统计，全区小学在校女生仅占适龄女生的２０％左右。
    要改变边远少数民族地区教育落后的状况，有关部门要及早制定特殊政策。
