The wind is gentle, and the flowers are in full bloom. Today, music and dance opened the curtain on the Ministry of Culture's Peking Opera Exchange Performance in Shenyang. The opening ceremony was lively and innovative, with no stage for the host, leaders seated in the audience, and the speaker standing in front of the microphone. The entire ceremony lasted about 20 minutes.

Eighteen Peking Opera troupes and drama schools from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang participated in this exchange performance, presenting 20 plays. Among them, nearly half are modern dramas, along with newly written historical plays and traditional programs that have been widely circulated in the history of Peking Opera.

Amidst the music and dance, people recall the development of Peking Opera. It originated from the folk, developed from the folk, and is close to social life and the people. Its content and form have continuously developed and matured with the progress of history. Therefore, this local opera with a relatively short history has developed into a major influential opera genre. The development of Peking Opera provides an experience: drama must develop by being close to the people and social life, and must progress with the times.

Relevant experts pointed out: this is the first grand gathering in the more than 100-year history of Peking Opera. Many famous drama experts came to observe the performances and exchange academic insights, aiming to produce a batch of new plays and new actors, achieving the goals of cultivating talent, producing plays, and generating benefits.
