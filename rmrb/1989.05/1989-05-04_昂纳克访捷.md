East German leader Honecker made a one-day working visit to Czechoslovakia yesterday.

Honecker arrived in Prague yesterday morning and held talks with the General Secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Jakes. Both sides highly praised the friendly cooperative relations between the two parties and the two countries, noting that the traditional high-level relationship between the two parties, ideological consensus, and respect for the multifaceted interests of the peoples of both countries are the foundations of their cooperation.

Jakes pointed out that the Czechoslovak Communist Party needs to learn from the experiences of the Soviet Union and other countries in its reforms, but Czechoslovakia insists on using these experiences based on its own democratic traditions and special conditions.

Honecker said that East Germany insists on increasing the attractiveness of socialism through economic achievements under the conditions of the scientific and technological revolution, and remains steadfast in pursuing this goal despite complex conditions.

Both sides agreed that the living standards of the peoples of the two countries are similar, and the development of their national economies has reached a certain level. There is broad scope for further development of cooperation between the two countries.
