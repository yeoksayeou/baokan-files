To address the challenges in beekeeping, the secretion rules of larch trees have been mastered. According to a report from our Beijing correspondent, He Huangbiao, larch honey is renowned for its superior taste and quality, making it one of China's primary export honey varieties. However, due to the influence of climate and other external conditions, the entire process of larch tree growth, development, flowering, and nectar secretion has not been fully understood. This has led to significant fluctuations in larch honey production, with abundant harvests in good years and virtually no yield in poor years. This unpredictability has posed considerable difficulties for beekeepers who need to relocate their hives.

To solve this practical problem, researchers from the Institute of Apiculture at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Agricultural Meteorological Station have conducted in-depth observations and studies in the Changbai Mountain forest area during the spring, summer, and autumn seasons. By analyzing the complex influences of external conditions on the various physiological processes of larch trees, they applied mathematical comprehensive evaluation methods and influence function curve simulation methods to simulate and calculate the annual larch tree yield. They established a forecasting model, which, after two years of practical application, has proven to be highly effective.

　　为养蜂业攻破难题
    椴树泌蜜规律被掌握
    本报北京５月２０日讯  记者何黄彪报道：椴树蜜味香质优，是我国主要的出口蜜种。但是，由于受气候等外界条件的影响，椴树生长、发育、开花、泌蜜的全过程一直未被认识，使椴蜜产量很不稳定，丰年，蜜多得无处存放；歉年，甚至滴蜜无收，给养蜂人员的转地养蜂造成了极大困难。
    为了解决这一实际问题，中国农科院养蜂所和农业气象室的科技人员每年春、夏、秋深入长白山林区，对椴树生长的全过程进行观察研究。在分析外界条件对椴树各生理进程复杂影响的基础上，应用数学综合评判法及影响函数曲线模拟法对历年椴树产量进行模拟计算，建立了预报模式，经过两年实践运用，效果很好。
