Title: The Difficulties of Publishing Academic Works

Authors are frustrated: Why is the publishing industry so "elitist"?

This is a true story: A scholar in his late seventies wrote a valuable academic work. After much effort, he found a publisher willing to print it, but the national pre-order quantity was only 300 copies. The publisher then demanded that the author sell the books himself to reach 3,000 copies, otherwise, it would not be printed. This scholar, who had never done business before, had to go to bookstores begging for orders, but the quantity still did not reach 1,000 copies. In the end, he had to use all his savings to order 2,000 copies. The books were printed, but how could a small room accommodate 2,000 books? It was truly a case of losing money and suffering.

Professor Qin Jie Liu, an entomology expert from Fudan University, wrote to Vice Chairman Zhou Gu Cheng of the National People's Congress Standing Committee: "The scientific publishing industry faces a worrying issue: scientific publications, especially high-level scientific and technological books, are being rejected in large numbers by scientific publishing units. This not only affects the development of scientific endeavors but also relates to the foundation of industrialization and may affect future generations." He requested that "National People's Congress representatives, when conducting inspections, include this issue as one of the topics and propose a correct solution during the National People's Congress meetings."

Publishers are also in a difficult situation, forced by profit demands to publish academic works at a loss.

According to a report from the Shanghai Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, Shanghai Science and Technology Press recently published 267 academic works, incurring losses of around 8 million yuan. Among them, "Encyclopedia of Chinese Medicine" edited by Qian Xin Zhong lost 2 million yuan, and "Comprehensive Chinese Medicine" with 16 volumes lost 400,000 yuan. The publisher, unable to bear the huge losses, has delayed the publication of more than 60 academic works.

People's Publishing House published 72 academic works in 1988, of which 51 were at a loss, totaling over 2 million yuan in losses. Currently, 30 academic works that have been printed can only be printed in quantities of one or two thousand copies each.

It is unfair to blame publishers for not wanting to publish books that lose money.

Academic works, despite having a narrow readership, should have potential for distribution. In such a large country, there are countless libraries and research institutions nationwide. For most books, achieving pre-orders of three to five thousand copies should not be difficult. There are indeed cases where a book, due to low pre-order quantities from bookstores, could not be published. The publisher then re-initiated pre-orders, or the author personally promoted the book, resulting in a significant increase in orders, quickly obtaining the "birth certificate." This is related to the obstruction of distribution channels. However, the other side of the problem is that books, as commodities entering the market, cannot be taken for granted. Some readers may need the book but may not necessarily buy it. Higher education institutions' libraries are the main buyers of academic works, but in recent years, their purchasing power has been declining. Firstly, there is a shortage of book purchasing funds. For example, Heilongjiang University's library received 5.4 million yuan for book purchases in 1986, reduced to 4.2 million yuan in 1987, and only 3.1 million yuan in 1988. On the other hand, book prices have increased significantly, rising by one to two times compared to 1984. It is said that Wuhan University's library purchased around 100,000 books annually before 1984, but only 50,000 books in 1987. If the funds remain the same, in 1989, it may not even be able to purchase 30,000 books. Meanwhile, the number of books published in 1984 was only around 40,000, but by 1988, it had increased to over 65,000, including a corresponding increase in the number of academic works published. Naturally, the purchase quantity for each book has decreased. Some people might say that books are not like vegetables, and bookstores should stock some. This makes sense. However, stocking books requires capital. According to the current interest rates for bookstore loans, a book priced at one yuan, if stored in a bookstore for a year, the discount earned would not even cover the interest. Moreover, the working capital of publishers and bookstores is also tight. There is a shocking figure: by the end of 1988, the national Xinhua Bookstores had inventory worth 2 billion yuan, including many valuable academic works.

Promotions rely on monographs, leading to a surge in authors, and publishers are overwhelmed.

Due to the implementation of professional title appointments, writing books has become a trend, which is a good thing. However, it has also brought about the issue of publishing capacity. Moreover, some books, objectively speaking, are of low quality and do not necessarily need to be published. Since having a monograph is a necessary condition for evaluating and appointing senior professional titles, books are written and then rushed to be published, putting immense pressure on publishers.

Publishers have adopted two "tricks" in response:

First, for books with too few pre-orders, they require authors to be responsible for selling or purchasing a portion to reach the printing quantity. Many academic monographs have specific reader groups, making it difficult to sell them in bookstores, while authors are often more familiar with them. Moreover, authors writing books should also be concerned about whether they can be sold. In today's socialist market economy, this does not seem reasonable. However, as a precondition for accepting publication, it is indeed too demanding.

Second, for books with significant losses, publishers require authors to raise funds to assist, and this is also a condition for accepting publication. Authors are very angry about this. For them, this is indeed more troublesome than writing a book. This method seems "unpopular."

One solution: Change the publishing tax policy to ease the profit constraint.

Firstly, publishers should pay attention to the publication of academic works and, through improving management, enhance their ability to offset losses with profits, making the greatest effort to publish more academic works.

Secondly, in tax policy, give publishers special preferential treatment. Currently, most publishers in China have to pay a considerable amount of income tax, plus the energy and transportation key construction fund, with an actual burden of around 45%. In contrast, most countries in the world adopt preferential policies for the taxation of publications. For example, countries like the United Kingdom, Portugal, Japan, Morocco, Brazil, and Colombia all implement a zero-tax policy. It is said that the governments of the United Kingdom and Japan have attempted to change the zero-tax policy for publications but were strongly opposed by public opinion. The Soviet Union provides necessary economic subsidies for some scientific and technological monographs and children's books that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood, not only in taxation but also in necessary economic subsidies. European Community member countries have an average book tax rate of 8%, with the lowest being Italy at only 2%.

In discussing China's publishing industry economic policy, many people are interested in implementing differential tax rates. Theoretically, implementing this economic policy can suppress publishers from publishing mediocre books and support the publication of excellent academic works. However, in reality, since academic works generally do not make a profit, there is no tax rate to speak of. Currently, the best-selling books that publishers rely on for survival will be listed under high tax rates, reducing publishers' ability to offset losses with profits, ultimately making it even more difficult to publish academic works.

Another solution: Rely on social assistance, especially needing large enterprises to support the publishing industry and help overcome difficulties.

Establishing an academic publication fund is currently a hot topic. Shandong Science and Technology Press established the "Taishan Science and Technology Publishing Fund," which received widespread praise from society. Subsequently, Chongqing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, and other provinces and cities also established various forms of academic publication funds. The fund sources are mainly from the profits of publishers, which is actually using the fund to subsidize the publication of academic works, changing from implicit subsidies to explicit ones. The key is that under the supervision of the fund management committee, limited funds are used to subsidize academic works with academic value and urgent need for publication. However, since the fund sources are from publishers, the funds for subsidizing academic works have not actually increased. Therefore, to alleviate the difficulty of publishing academic works, the state should allocate funds to establish a publication fund, which should be raised from various sectors of society, relying on social assistance.

Social assistance does not necessarily have to be in the form of a fund. Currently, some large enterprises are sharing the country's difficulties, assisting in education and sports, and of course, can also assist in publishing. According to the People's Health Publishing House, there are currently 87 valuable medical academic monographs that should be published as soon as possible, estimated to lose over 3 million yuan, and due to economic difficulties, it is temporarily difficult to arrange for publication. Among them are Huang Jia Si's "Auxiliary Circulation," Wang Yi Fei's "Reproductive Medicine," and Tao Zheng De's "Theory and Practice of Otolaryngology." The author humbly suggests that well-known enterprises like the Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory could sponsor the publication of a few medical academic monographs? Whoever sponsors the publication of academic works should have their contributions acknowledged in a prominent position in the book, recognizing their contributions to society. It is heard that Shougang is carrying out corporate culture activities, and the Metallurgical Publishing House currently has over 50 valuable academic works that cannot be published due to significant losses. Can both parties cooperate to make these academic works see the light of day as soon as possible? (Attached image)

### 学术著作出版难面面观

　　学术著作出版难面面观
    石峰
    作者们在愤愤然：出版界为什么如此“势利”？
    这是一个真实的故事：一位年近古稀的学者，写成了一本很有价值的学术著作，好不容易找到一家出版社惠允出版，但全国征订数只有３００册。于是出版社要求作者自己去书店兜售，凑足３０００册，否则不能付印。这位从来没有做过生意的书生不得不到书店沿门求情，订数仍不足１０００册。无奈只得拿出全部私蓄订了２０００册。书是出了，可是小小一间居室如何堆得下２０００册书？真是倒贴本钱活受罪。
    复旦大学昆虫学专家忻介六教授在给全国人大常委会副委员长周谷城的信中说：“科学出版事业出现一件很使人担忧的事，就是由于科学出版物，特别是较高层次的科技书籍，科学出版单位均大批退稿，这不仅会影响科学事业的发展，也关系到工业化的基础，可能关系到子孙后代的事。”他请求“人大代表赴各地考察之时，把这个问题作为考察题目之一，在人大开会时提出一个正确的解决办法。”
    　　　　出版社也苦不堪言，他们在利润的勒索下，赔进血本出版学术著作
    据上海市新闻出版局的报告：上海科技出版社近年出版２６７种学术著作，亏本达８００万元左右。其中由钱信忠主编的《中国医学百科全书》亏本２００万元，《中国医学大成》共１６卷，亏本４０万元，出版社因承担不了过于庞大的亏本，现仍有６０余种学术著作不得不推迟出版。
    人民出版社１９８８年出版学术著作７２种，其中５１种亏本，共亏本２０余万元。目前已投印的学术著作有３０余种，都只能印一二千册。
    指责出版社赔钱的书就不愿出，仍欠公允。
    　　　　征订工作困难重重，研究单位买不起，新华书店存不起，真是无可
    　　奈何
    学术著作尽管读者面窄，应该说发行工作还是有潜力的。我们这么大国家，全国那么多图书馆、科研单位，除少数书以外，征订到三五千册应该不算难。确有这样的事实，一本书因书店征订数少，难以出版，出版社就自己重新征订，或作者亲自去推销，结果订数成倍增加，很快领到了“出生证”。这与发行渠道不畅有关系。但问题的另一面是，书作为一种商品进入市场，是不能想当然的。有的读者需要这本书，但不一定买这本书。高等学校图书馆是订购学术著作的主要对象，但近几年来，购书能力逐年下降。首先是购书经费紧缺。黑龙江大学图书馆，１９８６年拨给购书经费５４万元，１９８７年减为４２万元，１９８８年只拨给３１万元。另一方面书刊定价大幅度提高，与１９８４年相比，提高了一至两倍。据说，武汉大学图书馆１９８４年以前，每年购书１０万册左右，１９８７年只能购５万册，如果还是那点钱，１９８９年可能还购不到３万册。同时图书的出版量１９８４年只有４万余种，１９８８年已增加到６．５万余种，其中学术著作的出版量也相应增加，每一种书的购买量自然下降。有的同志会说，书非青菜萝卜，书店应适当储备一点。这话不无道理。不过储备书得占用资金。根据目前书店贷款利率，一本一元钱的书，在书店存放一年，所得折扣还不够付利息。何况目前出版社、书店的流动资金也是捉襟见肘。有个惊人的数字，１９８８年底，全国新华书店库存达２０亿元，其中有不少是有价值的学术著作。
    　　　　评职称靠专著，于是著作家蜂起，出版社被压弯了腰
    由于实行了专业职务聘任，著书立说蔚然成风，这自然是好事，但也带来了出版承受能力问题。而且有的书平心而论，质量并不高，似无必要出版，由于有没有著作是评聘高级专业职务的必不可少的条件，因此书写出来以后都急于出版，给出版社造成很大压力。
    对此，出版社采取了两个“绝招”。
    一是对征订数太少的书，要求作者负责推销或包销一部分，以达到起印数。很多学术专著都有特定的读者对象，在书店发行比较困难，而作者往往比较熟悉。况且作者写了书，能不能销得出去全然不管，在发展社会主义商品经济的今天，也不见得合理。但作为是否接受出版的前提条件，也确实太苛求了。
    二是对亏损较多的书，要求作者筹款资助，并且也作为接受出版的一个条件，对此作者十分恼怒。这对他们来说，确实比写本书更伤脑筋，此法似“不得人心”。
    　　　　出路之一：改变出版的税收政策，松一松利润这个紧箍咒
    首先出版社要重视学术著作的出版，要通过改善经营管理，增强以盈补亏的能力，尽最大努力多出学术著作。
    其次在税收政策上给出版社以特别优惠。目前我国大部分出版社要交纳数量可观的所得税，加上能源交通重点建设基金，实际负担达４５％左右。而世界上大部分国家对出版物的税收都采取优惠的政策，如英国、葡萄牙、日本、摩洛哥、巴西、哥伦比亚等，都实行零税政策。据说英国、日本政府都曾试图改变出版物零税政策，结果遭到公众舆论的强烈反对。苏联对一些有利于国计民生的科技、学术专著和儿童读物，不但在税收上照顾，而且还给予必要的经济补贴。欧洲共同体成员国对图书征税率平均为８％，最低的如意大利只征收２％。
    在讨论我国出版业的经济政策中，不少人对实行差别税率颇感兴趣。从理论上讲，实行这一经济政策可以抑制出版社出版平庸的书，支持优秀学术著作的出版。但实际上由于学术著作一般没有盈利，因此也无税率可言。目前出版社赖以生存的畅销书，有一大部分将被列入高税率，使出版社以盈补亏的能力降低，结果反而导致学术著作出版更难。
    　　　　出路之二：依靠社会资助，特别需要大企业向出版界援手相助，帮
    　　度难关
    设立学术著作出版基金时下是个热门话题。山东科技出版社设立“泰山科技出版基金”，受到社会舆论的普遍赞誉。继而重庆、上海、浙江等省市也设立了不同形式的学术著作出版基金。基金来源多为从出版社利润中切出一块，这实际上是用基金的形式补贴学术著作出版，即由过去的暗补改为明补。重要的是，这种补贴在基金使用委员会的监督下，把有限的钱补贴到有学术价值、迫切需要出版的著作上。但是由于基金来源是出版社，羊毛出在羊身上，实际上学术著作的补贴资金并没有增加，因此要缓解学术著作出版难，国家要拨款设立出版基金，应该向社会各方筹集出版基金，依靠社会的资助。
    社会资助，并不一定非搞基金不可。现在一些大型企业为国家分担困难，资助办教育，办体育，当然也可以资助办出版。据人民卫生出版社反映，目前具有出版价值并宜尽早出版的医学学术专著有８７种，估计将亏本３００余万元，由于经济困难暂时难以安排出版。其中有黄家驷的《辅助循环》，王一飞的《生殖医学》，陶正德的《耳鼻咽喉科理论与实践》。笔者冒昧地提议，像北京制药厂这样著名的企业，能不能出资出几本医学方面的学术专著呢？谁资助出版了学术著作，应在书的显要位置为其“树碑立传”，承认其对社会的贡献。听说首钢正在开展企业文化活动，而冶金出版社目前就有５０余种较有价值的学术著作因亏本太多而无力出版。双方能否搞个协作，使这批学术著作早日问世呢？（附图片）
