The Netherlands' arable land covers only 2.01 million hectares, and its agricultural labor force consists of just 290,000 people. However, in 1987, its total agricultural exports amounted to approximately $25 billion, making it the second-largest agricultural exporter after the United States. In the previous year, cheese exports reached 400,000 tons, ranking first in the world. Other agricultural products such as butter, condensed milk, eggs, and potatoes also hold prominent positions in the international market. As for flower exports, which account for 60% of the global market, the Netherlands is unrivaled.

This miraculous achievement was primarily made possible by what? On April 25, this reporter interviewed Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers and asked him to share the secrets of the Netherlands' agricultural development. The Prime Minister smiled and replied, "We have a model that suits us."

The basic unit of agricultural production in the Netherlands is the family farm. Currently, there are over 130,000 farms nationwide, with each household averaging 15 hectares of land and 41 cows, making the scale relatively small. Farmers are independent economic entities but also collaborate in certain areas, engaging in cooperative farming. Initially, this cooperation involved credit, which gradually expanded to include the production, transportation, storage, processing, and sales of agricultural products, as well as the supply of agricultural materials and technical services. There are over 2,000 such cooperatives nationwide, covering various regions. On average, each of the 130,000 farmers participates in 3 to 4 cooperatives with different functions. These primary cooperatives are further organized into 25 central cooperatives based on their functions.

Farmers join cooperatives through various means such as purchasing shares or signing contracts with the cooperatives. The obligations and rights of members vary from one cooperative to another, with no uniform standards. However, all cooperatives share a common goal: to serve their members without pursuing profits. Primary cooperatives retain full autonomy over central cooperatives. The responsibility of the central cooperatives is to coordinate policies, exchange experiences, influence the government, and protect the interests of the primary level.

Another crucial measure in the Netherlands' agricultural development is the integration of research and training.

The Netherlands' agricultural research, which aims to improve production efficiency and product quality, is highly developed and divided into three categories: basic research, applied research, and practical research. Basic research is primarily conducted by the Agricultural University of Wageningen and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Utrecht. Applied research is overseen by 25 research institutes under the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, focusing on how to apply basic research findings to practical problems faced by current and future farms. Practical research is carried out by experimental stations or experimental farms, mainly to promote new findings. The relationship between these three types of institutions is formalized through contracts, enabling rapid information exchange and forming a comprehensive research network that includes soil improvement, seed cultivation, agricultural product processing, environmental protection, and pest control.

The Dutch Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries is responsible for training farmers, allocating half of its budget annually to agricultural education, research, and technology promotion. Primary, secondary, and tertiary professional training schools are scattered across the country, with over 60,000 students enrolled, accounting for one-fifth of the agricultural workforce. In addition to formulating agricultural policies, the Ministry's central task is to "invest in human capital." A comprehensive and systematic education system provides a solid foundation of talent and knowledge for the stable development of agriculture.

Prime Minister Lubbers stated that the cooperation between cooperatives, research and training, as well as the close collaboration with relevant government departments, enable farmers to continuously develop production using the best methods, the most advanced scientific and technological means, and the most economical management. This is our model and the reason for our agricultural success.

　　荷兰的农业成就与农业模式
    本报记者  魏崴
    荷兰的耕地面积仅为２０１万公顷，农业劳动人口只有２９万。然而，１９８７年，它的农产品出口总额约为２５０亿美元，是仅次于美国的第二大农业出口国。去年，奶酪出口达４０万吨，居世界第一。其它农产品如黄油、炼乳、鸡蛋、马铃薯的出口也在国际市场上地位显赫，名列前茅。至于囊括了６０％世界花卉市场的花卉出口，更使其它国家望尘莫及。
    这奇迹般的成就，主要是靠什么创造出来的？４月２５日，本报记者在采访荷兰首相吕贝尔斯时，请他谈谈荷兰发展农业的奥妙。首相笑而答曰：“我们有一个适合我们自己的模式”。
    荷兰农业生产的基本单位是家庭农场。目前，全国农场总数１３万多，平均每户拥有土地１５公顷，奶牛４１头，规模都不甚大。农民是独立的经济单元，但又在某些方面联合起来，合作经营。开始是进行信贷合作，以后逐渐推广到农产品的生产、运输、储藏、加工、销售、农业物资的供应以及信贷、技术服务等领域。各类合作社共２０００余家，遍布全国各地。１３万多户农民平均每户参加３至４个职能不同的合作社。这些基层合作社又分门别类，在全国组成２５个中央合作社。
    农民参加合作社，是通过认股或与合作社签订合同等不同形式，社员所承担的义务和享受的权利也因社而异，无统一规格。但是，各类合作社有一共同点：替社员服务，不以赢利为目的。各基层合作社对中央合作社保留充分的自主权。中央合作社的责任是协调政策，交流经验，影响政府，维护基层利益。
    荷兰发展农业的另一个重要措施是科研、培训配套。
    以提高生产率及产品质量为宗旨的荷兰农业科研，相当发达，分基础研究、应用研究和实际研究三类。基础研究由瓦格宁根的农业大学和乌得勒之兽医学院为主，应用研究由属于农业渔业部的２５个研究所负责，任务是如何把基础研究成果用于实践，解决当前与今后农场面临的问题。实际研究由实验站或实验农场进行，主要是推广新成果。这三类机构之间的关系，以合同形式制度化，相互迅速交流信息，形成一个土壤改良、种子培育、农产品加工、环境保护、病虫害防治等专业设置齐备的科研网络。
    荷兰政府农渔部负责对农民进行技术培训，每年用于农业教育、科研及技术推广的费用，占该部预算的一半。初级、中级和高级专业培训学校遍及全国各地区，在校学生６万多，相当于农业就业人口的１／５。除制定农业政策外，农渔部的中心任务就是“对人力资本的投资”。充分、系统的教育体制为农业稳定发展提供了扎实的人才和知识基础。
    吕贝尔斯首相说，合作社、科研培训以及与政府有关部门之间的密切合作，使农民可以不断以最优良的方法、最先进的科学技术、最经济的管理发展生产，这就是我们的模式，我们的农业成功的原因。
