Strengthen Parliamentary Ties, Promote People's Friendship, Develop State Relations
Wan Li Arrives in Vancouver to Begin North American Tour

New China News Agency, Vancouver, May 12 (Reporter Xu Linxing) – The Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Wan Li, arrived in Vancouver, a city on the west coast of Canada, this afternoon, beginning an important 21-day visit to Canada and the United States.

The coastal city of Vancouver, nestled between mountains and water, is lush with greenery and valleys, making it a delightful place to be.

When Wan Li's special plane landed in this garden-like city, he was warmly welcomed by the Deputy Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons, Champagne, Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Wenpo, Chinese Consul General in Vancouver Duan Jin, and representatives of the local Chinese community.

Accompanying Wan Li on his North American tour are his wife Bian Tao, Vice Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Cao Zhi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhu Qizhen, and Vice Chairman of the Law Committee of the National People's Congress Gu Ming.

Vancouver is the first stop on Wan Li's visit to Canada. He will also visit Victoria, Regina, Ottawa, and Toronto. After completing his cross-Canada tour, the 73-year-old Chinese leader will fly to the United States on May 22 for his visit.

Wan Li's North American tour is the first visit by a Chairman of the National People's Congress to Canada and the United States since the founding of New China 40 years ago. A Chinese official accompanying the visit told a reporter that the main mission of Chairman Wan Li's visit is to strengthen ties between parliaments, promote friendship between the peoples, and advance the development of state relations through contact with Canadian and American leaders.
