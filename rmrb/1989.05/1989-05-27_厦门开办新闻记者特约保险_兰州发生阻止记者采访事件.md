Xiamen Insurance Company has started offering special personal accident insurance for journalists and news workers from May. This is the first time such insurance has been provided on the Chinese mainland.

The policy states that if journalists and news workers suffer intentional harm from others while performing their duties, resulting in death or permanent loss of all labor capacity for themselves or their dependents, the insurance company will compensate for losses beyond the scope of the "Personal Accident Insurance Clauses." This includes damage to personal property caused by malicious retaliation, excluding items like cash, tickets, and other items of indeterminate value.

On April 1, the People's Court of Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, publicly tried the case of Liu Jitao for intentional injury. Two reporters from the Gansu Province "Legal System Guide" newspaper, holding letters of introduction from their newspaper, entered the courtroom for coverage (the court did not issue listening or press passes to the audience). When the court was in session, the reporters took out their notebooks to record, but were stopped by a judge from the collegial panel. The reporters immediately showed their identification and informed the judge that they had contacted a responsible person from the criminal court in advance, but were still prohibited from taking notes in court. Thus, a lawful court trial coverage was obstructed.

　　厦门开办新闻记者特约保险
    兰州发生阻止记者采访事件
    ●厦门保险公司５月起开办新闻记者及从事新闻工作的人员人身意外伤害特约保险。开办这种保险业务，在中国大陆尚属首次。
    条款中说，新闻记者和从事新闻工作的人员在履行工作职责过程中，遭受他人所施加的故意伤害，致使自己或连带被保险人死亡或永久丧失全部劳动能力，除金银、票证等以及无法鉴定价值的财产外，因恶意报复行为造成个人财产损失，保险公司将按在《人身意外伤害保险条款》承担保险责任外，再予以赔偿。

    ●４月１日，兰州市城关区人民法院公开审理刘继涛故意伤害一案，甘肃省《法制导报》两名记者持报社介绍信前往联系后进入法庭采访（法院未给旁听者发旁听证或采访证）。开庭时，记者拿出采访本正拟记录，却遭到合议庭一审判员阻止。记者当即出示身份证明并告之事前已与刑事审判庭一位负责人联系过，但仍被禁止当庭作记录。一次合法的法庭审判采访，就这样被阻止。
