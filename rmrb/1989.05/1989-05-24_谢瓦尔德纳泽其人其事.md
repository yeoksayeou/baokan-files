Several years ago, when Eduard Shevardnadze, who had been unknown to the public, suddenly replaced Gromyko, who had served as the Soviet Foreign Minister for over twenty years, the outside world only knew that Shevardnadze had previously served as the First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Soon, his active figure frequently appeared on the international diplomatic stage.

Who exactly is Eduard Shevardnadze?

The "Eagle" of Georgia

Eduard Shevardnadze, now 61, was born in a village in the southwestern part of Georgia called Mamati. His father was a history teacher, and his name comes from the Georgian word for "falcon." In his youth, he worked in the local Communist Youth League. In 1965, he was promoted to the position of Minister of Internal Affairs of Georgia. In 1972, because of his relentless opposition to corrupt activities, he clashed with the then First Secretary, Mtskhvetadze, and faced the threat of being dismissed. He then took evidence of the First Secretary's involvement in black-market dealings to Moscow. Within 24 hours, Moscow appointed him to replace Mtskhvetadze.

There is a well-known anecdote about him. After taking office, at the end of his first cadre meeting, he had the attendees raise their left hands for a minute to inspect the expensive imported watches on their wrists. The First Secretary, who wore a domestically produced "Slav" watch, then ordered those officials to "donate" their watches to the state. In the following two years, he led a severe anti-corruption campaign and reportedly narrowly escaped assassination twice. Even before Gorbachev proposed reforms, he promoted family farming in rural areas and factory autonomy in cities in Georgia, and advocated for material rewards for workers.

In 1978, students in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, held a demonstration protesting a new constitution that did not recognize Georgian as an official language. Shevardnadze personally addressed the students, promising to consider their demands, and led them out of the demonstration square with a megaphone. Another time, during a football match in Tbilisi, a disturbance occurred, and he rushed onto the field alone, calming the angry spectators and maintaining order. Recently, he canceled his visits to East and West Germany, flew to Tbilisi on behalf of the central government, and quelled a national conflict.

The "Architect" of New Diplomacy

American Soviet expert Legvold once said, "Shevardnadze, like Gorbachev, has creative ideas and is not just a tool."

He values every minute. During the 15-minute drive from his residence to the Foreign Ministry building, he already knows the day's international news through phone calls. As soon as he arrives at his seventh-floor office, he immediately handles diplomatic telegrams. The conference room is equipped with closed-circuit television, broadcasting American news programs at any time.

To implement Gorbachev's new diplomatic strategy, he performed a "major surgery" on the Foreign Ministry. Within a year and a half, he replaced nine out of twelve deputy ministers, three-quarters of the ambassadors, and two-thirds of the consuls, and established new departments to handle disarmament and human rights issues.

Shevardnadze encourages debate. He often invites people with different opinions to challenge the foreign policy. In the three monthly informal consultations attended by 29 people, senior diplomats of the Foreign Ministry and invited experts often discuss for four to five hours.

At the negotiating table, this silver-haired and smiling foreign minister is more flexible than his predecessor, willing to make concessions on minor issues to focus on key disagreements; but on matters of principle, he is unwavering. In Afghanistan, he forced the unhappy President Najibullah to accept the decision of the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops. During the negotiations on the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, he quickly agreed to the principle of on-site inspections, much to the surprise of his American counterparts.

Some Westerners believe that Shevardnadze is reasonable and humorous. Once, during a visit to the American capital, a man suddenly rushed to his car. American security personnel immediately rushed up and pushed him aside. Seeing this, Shevardnadze got out of the car and went over to inquire. The man said that his elderly father in the Soviet Union was seriously ill, and he urgently wanted to return to see him one last time but had been delayed in obtaining a visa. Shevardnadze immediately approved his request, and the man, grateful, left satisfied.

In the short four years that Shevardnadze has been foreign minister, the Soviet Union has taken a series of major diplomatic actions that have attracted worldwide attention. People comment that if Gorbachev is the designer of the Soviet Union's new diplomatic thinking, then Shevardnadze is the architect who built this new diplomatic edifice.

　　谢瓦尔德纳泽其人其事
    仓立德
    几年前，当任苏联外长达二十余年的葛罗米柯突然由名不见经传的谢瓦尔德纳泽取代时，外界除了知道谢氏曾任格鲁吉亚共和国党的第一书记外，其他一无所知。不久，国际外交舞台上便经常出现了他的活跃身影。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽究竟是个什么样的人？
    格鲁吉亚之“鹰”　现年六十一岁的谢瓦尔德纳泽出生于格鲁吉亚西南部马马提一个村庄。他的父亲是位历史教员，他的名字源于格鲁吉亚语“猎鹰”。他年轻时在当地共青团工作，一九六五年升任格鲁吉亚内务部长。一九七二年，由于他无情地反对腐化活动，与当时的第一书记姆察瓦泽发生冲突，遇到解职威胁。于是他带上这位第一书记深陷黑市交易的证据前往莫斯科，结果二十四小时内莫斯科便让他接替了姆察瓦泽的职务。
    当地流传着他的一则轶事。谢氏上任后在第一次干部大会结束时，让与会者举左手表决一分钟，他走了一圈看那些腕上的昂贵进口表，随后，这位带着苏联自产“斯拉夫”牌表的第一书记下令让那些官员将表“捐赠”给国家。此后两年，他领导了严厉的反腐化斗争，据说曾两次险遭暗害。早在戈尔巴乔夫提出改革之前，他便在格鲁吉亚促进农村的家庭式作业和城镇的工厂自主权，并提倡给工人以物质奖励。
    一九七八年，格鲁吉亚首都第比利斯发生学生示威，抗议当时通过的一部新宪法不承认格鲁吉亚语为官方语言。谢瓦尔德纳泽出来当面向学生讲话，答应考虑他们的要求，并手执扩音器将学生带出示威的广场。另一次，第比利斯举行足球赛时，发生球场风波，他只身跑到球场上，让狂怒的观众冷静下来保持秩序。不久前他取消了对民主德国和联邦德国的访问，代表中央飞往第比利斯平息了一场民族冲突。
    外交新厦的“建筑师”　美国的苏联问题专家列格沃德曾说，“谢瓦尔德纳泽像戈尔巴乔夫一样具有创造性思想，而不单纯是他的工具”。
    他珍惜每一分钟。在他早上乘车从住所赶往外交部大楼的十五分钟的路程上，他已通过电话了解了当天的国际大事，一上七楼办公室便立即处理外交文电。会议室摆着闭路电视，随时播送美国新闻节目。
    为了贯彻戈尔巴乔夫的外交新战略，他对外交部动了“大手术”，在一年多时间里便撤换了十二位副外长中的九位，四分之三的驻外大使和三分之二的总领事，并成立了处理裁军和人权问题的新部门。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽鼓励争论。他经常召集具有不同意见的人对外交政策提出“挑战性观点”。在每月三次的由二十九人出席的非正式磋商中，外交部资深外交官和应邀赴会的专家们常常讨论四五个小时。
    在谈判桌上，这位满头银丝而笑容可掬的外长比其前任显得更灵活，愿意在次要问题上做出让步，以便集中在关键性分歧上；但对原则性问题却坚定不移。在阿富汗，他迫使不高兴的纳吉布拉总统接受苏军全部撤离的决定。在谈判中导时，他迅速同意了现场核查原则，颇令美国对手感到意外。
    一些西方人士认为，谢瓦尔德纳泽办事通情达理，言谈幽默。一次谢氏在美国首都访问，车队行进中，一位男子突然扑至他的座车前。美国保安人员立即冲上去扭住他，将他推至一边。谢氏见状却走出车外，上前询问。那人诉说在苏联的老父病重，他急于赶回去见上最后一面，却迟迟得不到签证。谢氏当即批准他的请求，那人称谢不迭，满意而去。
    在谢氏担任外长的短短四年里，苏联采取了一系列举世瞩目的重大外交行动。人们评论说，如果戈尔巴乔夫是苏联外交“新思维”的设计师，那么谢瓦尔德纳泽便是构筑这所外交新厦的建筑师。
