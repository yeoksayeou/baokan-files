In recent years, the standards for social-organized sports competitions have been getting higher and higher. The accommodations, rewards, and gifts have been becoming more and more elaborate. The standards for hospitality keep getting higher, as if there is a competition to see who can be the most luxurious, the most extravagant, and the most impressive.

This trend, although it has not yet become widespread, is quite strong and cannot be ignored.

Social-organized sports can supplement the lack of funds for state-organized sports competitions, enrich the lives of the masses in sports, and are beneficial for sports exchanges, promotion, and the improvement of sports levels. However, if we do not start from reality and organize competitions in a thrifty manner, even good things can become difficult to sustain. First, the expenses are getting higher and higher, making organizers hesitate to take on the responsibility. Second, it is easy to foster a "comparison" mentality among athletes and coaches, where they will only put in effort if they feel it is "worth it," and will just go through the motions if they don't. Third, extravagant practices will inevitably draw criticism from the masses, creating a negative impact on social-organized sports. Fourth, the imbalance between competition conditions and competition levels—where the former improves but the latter declines...

There are many other negative impacts that this trend can bring. Good things need everyone to care for, love, support, and promote their development. This naturally includes timely reminders and corrections of any negative trends that arise in the development of good things. These words are said with the intention of improvement and should not be considered redundant.

　　比什么？
    晨星
    近年来，社会办体育比赛规格越来越高。食宿、奖金、礼品之类越来越讲究，招待的标准一家要胜过一家，似乎在展开一场比豪华、比阔绰、比气派的竞赛。
    这种苗头，虽说目下还未成燎原之势，但风头颇硬，不可忽视。
    社会办体育，既可弥补国家办体育比赛经费之不足，又可丰富群众体育生活，更有利于体育交流、普及和体育水平的提高。可如果不从实际出发，勤俭办赛，好事也会办不下去的。其一，支出越来越大，主办者望而却步，不敢承担；其二，极易在运动员、教练员中间形成一种“攀比”心态，“够意思”就卖力参加，“不够意思”就应付了事；其三，铺张之风必然引起群众的意见。给社会办体育造成不良影响；其四，比赛条件和比赛水平的失衡，前者提高了，后者反而下降了……还可以说出许多这种苗头带来的不好影响。
    好事情需要大家共同关心、爱护、扶持，促其发展，其中自然包括及时提醒和克服“好事情”发展中不好的苗头。这些话说出来意在改进，不算多余吧。
