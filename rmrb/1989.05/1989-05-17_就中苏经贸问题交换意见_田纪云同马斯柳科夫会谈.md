Vice Premier Tian Jiyun held a working meeting with First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Maslyukov at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse on the morning of May 17. Both sides exchanged views on economic cooperation and trade exchanges.

Tian Jiyun said that the historic progress in restoring normal relations between the two countries and the two parties has created very good conditions for further development of economic and trade cooperation between the two countries. Chairman Maslyukov also said that the two sides should discuss the issue of economic and trade cooperation well.

Both sides discussed cooperation in the fields of energy, transportation, metallurgy, light industry, and labor services. Both sides agreed that experts from the two countries should first study how to carry out cooperation in this area and exchange specific views.

Both sides believe that border trade between China and the Soviet Union has developed rapidly in recent years and, in general, should continue to encourage the development of such trade. However, both sides also believe that certain chaotic phenomena that have emerged in border trade should be rectified.

Both sides agreed that the Sino-Soviet Economic and Trade Science and Technology Committee will hold its fourth meeting in Moscow in July this year. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun will lead a delegation to attend the meeting as the chairman of the committee from the Chinese side.
