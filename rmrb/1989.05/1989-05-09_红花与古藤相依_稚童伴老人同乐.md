In a spacious and quiet courtyard, elderly people over seventy years old live alongside children full of youthful innocence. The elderly feel that "life is made more joyful with children around," while the children feel more warmth with the elderly by their side. This unique combination has been described by some as "red flowers and ancient wisteria depending on each other, naturally delightful."

This is the scene that reporters witnessed at the Happiness Home in Longkou Town, Longkou City, Shandong Province. There, 8 elderly individuals who are alone in the world live with 162 "little innocents." The age difference is stark, with the oldest being 89 years old and the youngest just 5 years old.

This is a kingdom filled with love. Whenever the children sing, dance, or play games, the elderly will automatically bring chairs to sit by and watch, either stroking their beards with a smile or clapping and praising. Whenever the children sweetly call out "grandma" or "grandpa," the elderly are even more overjoyed, with some opening their arms to tightly hug the children, like a picture of "hundreds of grandchildren surrounding their ancestor."

Children and the elderly have been living together for over four years. The predecessor of this Happiness Home was originally an elderly care home for the lonely and elderly, with no "little innocents" involved. Li Hongfa, a responsible person in Longkou Town, introduced that the government built the elderly care home in June 1984 and soon considered the construction of a kindergarten. The welfare of the elderly should not only be material but must also include spiritual comfort and supplementation. Thus, in the winter of the same year, the kindergarten and the elderly care home were merged together.

In this Happiness Home, seesaws, merry-go-rounds, small basketball courts, and various board games coexist, allowing the elderly and children to each find their own joy.

The Happiness Home has three rows of flat-roofed buildings. The front row is for the elderly, the back row is for the kindergarten classrooms, and in between are administrative offices, ensuring that each side does not interfere with the other. When the elderly get tired of watching the children play, they can return to their own rooms, close the door, and it is very quiet.

The 83-year-old Ms. Sun Huifang does not originally live in Longkou Town. She has never married and has a solitary personality. In her old age, her childlike heart bloomed again. She heard that Longkou Town had established a Happiness Home with children and insisted on coming here to spend her remaining years.

　　红花与古藤相依     
    稚童伴老人同乐
    本报讯  在一个宽敞清静的院落里，生活着年逾古稀的老人和一腔童真的娃娃。老人为有孩子相伴感到“生活平添几分欢乐”，孩子为有老人相随体味到更多的温暖。对这种奇特的组合，有人形容为“红花与古藤相依，天然成趣”。
    这是记者在山东省龙口市龙口镇幸福院见到的情景。里面住着８位孤寡老人和１６２名“小天真”。年龄的反差极为强烈，最大的８９岁，最小的才满５周岁。
    这里是充满爱的“王国”。每当娃娃们唱歌、跳舞、做游戏时，老人们总要自动搬把椅子坐在一旁作观众，或捻须含笑，或拍手称赞。每当孩子们甜甜地喊奶奶、叫爷爷时，老人们更是乐不可支，有的张开双臂把孩子紧紧搂在怀里，宛如一幅“百孙拥祖图”。
    孩子和老人同堂生活已经４年有余。这个幸福院的前身本是收留孤寡老人的敬老院，尚无“小天真”插足其间。龙口镇负责人李洪发介绍说，政府于１９８４年６月建起敬老院不久就考虑到幼儿园的建设。对老人的福利不应仅仅是物质方面的，必须兼有精神上的调剂与补充。于是，同年冬天幼儿园和敬老院便合建在一起了。
    在幸福院这个天地里，翘翘板、转动车、小小篮球场与各种棋类并存，老人和孩子可以各投所好，各得其所。
    幸福院共有三排平房，前排是老人住处，后排是幼儿教室，中间隔着一排办公用房，彼此互不干扰。老人看孩子玩耍看累了，回到自己房间，关上门，挺安静。
    ８３岁的老太太孙惠芳本不住在龙口镇，一辈子没有结婚，性情孤僻，到老来童心复萌。她听说龙口镇办了个有孩子的幸福院，执意要来这里安度晚年。
