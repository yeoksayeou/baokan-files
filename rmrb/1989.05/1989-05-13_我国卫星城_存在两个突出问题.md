Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences sociologist Zhong Rongkui, deputy researcher, said that after concentrating on a year-long investigation of some large cities' satellite cities, two prominent problems were discovered: First, satellite cities have not formed a system to repel large cities' populations. For example, Beijing's largest satellite city, Tongzhou, has only seen a 4.2% increase in population from the urban area over 15 years; Tianjin's seven satellite cities have only 2.5% of the urban population from the city; Shanghai's seven satellite cities have 160,000 workers from the urban area, but only 40,000 have settled down, accounting for about 0.6% of the urban population. It is clear that the construction of satellite cities has not achieved the goal of dispersing the population of large cities. Second, economic benefits are extremely low. Taking Shanghai as an example, enterprises relocated from the urban area to the seven satellite cities create less than half the value per 100 yuan of fixed assets compared to urban enterprises. This is because workers are not committed to their jobs, shifts are not fully utilized, equipment utilization rates are low; commuting costs are high, such as in Songjiang, where various municipal factories spend 50 million yuan annually on renting cars; the burden of living facilities construction is heavy, and a large number of collective dormitories need to be built for "dual-residence" workers. Excluding Wusong, the six satellite cities have built a total of 440,000 square meters of housing for municipal enterprises. Therefore, some workers say that building such satellite cities is labor-intensive and wasteful. Additionally, there are a series of social issues such as environmental pollution and cultural life that need to be urgently addressed.

　　我国卫星城    
    存在两个突出问题
    上海社科院社会学研究所钟荣魁副研究员说，集中了一年多的时间对一些大城市的卫星城进行了调查，发现目前存在两个突出的问题：一是没有形成对大城市的反磁力体系。如北京最大卫星城通县镇，１５年里所增人口只有４．２％来自市区；天津７个卫星城，来自城市人口占市区总人口的２．５％，上海７个卫星城有１６万职工来自市区，而安家的仅４万人，约占市区人口的０．６％。可见，卫星城建设并未实现疏散大城市人口的目的。二是经济效益极为低下。以上海为例，由市区迁往７个卫星城的企业，每百元固定资产创造的价值不及市区企业的１／２。因为工人不安心工作，班次开不足，设备利用率低；上下班的交通费用大，如松江镇各市属厂每年的租车费高达５００万元；生活设施建设负担重，其中要为“两栖”职工盖大量集体宿舍，除吴淞外的６个卫星城市属企业，共建造住房面积４４万平方米。因此，有职工说搞这种卫星城劳民伤财。此外，还有环境污染、文化生活等一系列的社会问题亟待解决。
