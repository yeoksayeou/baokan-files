Over the past year, Britain has taken various measures to fully implement the government's science and technology policy, leading to profound changes in the scientific community.

"Nations that do not value intellectuals will perish": British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher pointed out, "All successful nations place the popularization of science and knowledge in a very high priority," "The effective use of knowledge is crucial to a nation's prosperity," "Nations that do not value intellectuals are bound to perish." Therefore, the British government has made science a compulsory subject for all school-age children. Since last July, Thatcher has personally chaired meetings of the Science and Technology Advisory Committee, involving the entire cabinet in the formulation of science and technology policies, truly bringing science and technology to the highest level for consideration. At the same time, organizational adjustments have been made, establishing a unified Science and Technology Advisory Committee, chaired by the Prime Minister, with the chairman of Rolls-Royce overseeing daily affairs.

Prioritizing research with commercial potential: The British government emphasizes the use of potential commercial value as the main criterion for selecting priority development areas, concentrating resources on strategic research fields, i.e., areas that may have commercial returns within five to ten years, and establishing a series of new interdisciplinary research centers.

For this purpose, the British government adjusted research projects last year. On one hand, the government resisted domestic and international pressures, firmly withdrawing from or reducing projects with little commercial value or no commercial significance in the foreseeable future. For example, it significantly reduced investments in the European Space Agency, reorganized the National Space Center to focus on research with commercial prospects and industrial needs, such as remote sensing satellites. Nuclear fusion and fast breeder reactors, on the other hand, were left to richer countries to handle, with the option to import when successful. On the other hand, the government firmly implemented the policy that research close to the market should be undertaken by the industry. The most typical example is the government's decision to let the industry develop the £1 billion Alvey Plan.

Promoting industrial investment: To enhance competitiveness, the government has taken a series of measures to encourage the industry to increase investment in research and development: eliminating government funding for research and development close to the market, leaving it to the industry to bear the cost; providing government support for important research and development projects with commercial prospects; government sharing of risk investments; providing information; and requiring private companies to disclose their research and development expenditures annually.

Emphasizing environmental science research: Prime Minister Thatcher said, "A healthy economy and a healthy environment are interdependent. The protection and improvement of the global ecological environment are prerequisites for economic stability and prosperity. Maintaining ecological balance is the greatest challenge of the end of this century." In 1989, the British government will significantly increase its investment in environmental research. Of the £306 million new funds allocated by the Department of Education this year, a significant portion will be used for environmental science research. The government believes that in the future, when evaluating and selecting research projects, in addition to economic potential, ecological feasibility should also be considered.

Strengthening international cooperation: Britain has shown a clear shift in its attitude towards European cooperation this year. In the past five years, the ratio of Britain's investment in the European Information Cooperation Program to its domestic Alvey Plan was 2:3, with a focus on the Alvey Plan. In 1988, Britain changed its approach, prioritizing participation in the European Information Cooperation Program, while implementing a smaller information technology plan domestically as a supplement. The investment ratio for the two programs is now 3:2.

### 英国科技政策战略性转变

　　英国科技政策战略性转变
    许幼禹　徐绍颖
    近一年来，英国采取各种措施，全面贯彻政府的科技政策，使科技界开始发生深刻的变化。
    “不重视知识分子国家要走向灭亡”：英国首相撒切尔夫人指出，“所有成功的国家都把科学和知识的普及放在非常优先的地位”，“知识及其有效的使用对国家的繁荣是至关重要的”，“不重视知识分子的国家必然走向灭亡”。因此，英国政府已把科学列为所有学龄儿童的必修课程。去年七月以来，撒切尔夫人还定期亲自主持科技顾问委员会的会议，使整个内阁介入科技政策的制定，真正将科学技术带进最高层次加以考虑。同时进行机构调整，成立了统一的科技顾问委员会，由首相亲自主持，由罗尔·罗伊斯公司的董事长负责日常事务。
    以潜在商业价值为主要标准：英国政府强调，以研究的潜在商业价值作为选择优先发展领域的主要标准，把资源相对集中于战略性的研究领域，即五至十年内可能有商业回收的领域，建立了一系列新的跨学科的研究中心。
    为此，英国政府去年对研究项目进行了调整。一方面，政府顶住了国内外的压力，坚决退出或削减掉一些商业价值不大或在相当长时间内没有商业意义的项目，例如大大削减了对欧洲航天局的投资，改组了国家空间中心，使之集中研究有商业前景的、符合工业界需要的项目，如遥感卫星等。而核聚变、快速增殖反应堆等研究，让更为富裕的国家去做，等研究成功后，需要时可以引进。另一方面，坚决执行靠近市场的研究应由工业界来承担的政策，最典型的例子是，政府让工业界来开发经费为十亿镑的阿尔维计划。
    促进工业界投资：为了提高竞争能力，政府采取了一系列措施来促进工业界对研究开发增加投资：取消对“靠近市场”的研究开发的资助，让工业界来承担；对一些有商业前景的重要研究开发项目，政府给以资助；政府分担风险投资；提供信息；要求私营公司每年公布其研究开发的费用等。
    重视环境科学研究：首相撒切尔夫人说，“健康发展的经济同健康的环境是相互依存的，全球生态环境的保护和改善是经济稳定和繁荣发展的前提，保护生态环境平衡是本世纪末的最大挑战”。一九八九年英国政府对环境问题的研究投资将大大增加。在今年教科部新增加的三点零六亿英镑的经费中将有较大比例用于环境科学研究。政府认为：今后在衡量和选择研究项目时，除了在经济上有预示的潜力外，还要考虑在生态上也是可行的。
    加强国际合作：英国今年在对待欧洲合作的态度上有了明显的转变。前五年，英国对欧洲信息合作计划的投资和对本国阿尔维计划的投资的比例是二比三，即重点放在阿尔维计划上。一九八八年，英国改为以参加欧洲信息合作计划为主，在国内则开展一个小的信息技术计划作为补充，对两者的投资比例为三比二。
