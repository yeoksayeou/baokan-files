People's Daily reports: Correspondent Aixiao reports: The World Health Organization has designated May 31st as the second "World No-Smoking Day," with the theme "Women and Tobacco." The National Hygiene and Health Commission, in response to this initiative, has issued a special notice calling on all smokers in China to voluntarily stop smoking for one day on May 31st, using this as a starting point to achieve successful smoking cessation. It also calls on sales units and stalls to stop selling tobacco products for one day.

According to a survey, the smoking rate among women in China is 7%, which, although lower than in some industrialized countries, has been rising rapidly in recent years. The National Hygiene and Health Commission calls on Chinese women not only to refrain from smoking themselves but also to leverage their influence within the family to persuade other members not to smoke. In the future, further measures will be taken to prohibit smoking.

　　５月３１日——    
    世界第二个无烟日    
    爱卫会号召吸烟者争取戒烟成功
    本报讯  记者艾笑报道：世界卫生组织决定今年５月３１日为第二个“世界无烟日”，主题是“妇女与烟草”。全国爱卫会为积极响应这一倡导，日前发出专门通知号召全国吸烟者在５月３１日自愿停止吸烟一天，并以此为开端，争取戒烟成功；号召销售单位和摊点停售烟草制品一天。
    据调查，我国妇女吸烟率为７％，虽较某些工业国低，但这个比率近年来正在高速上升。全国爱卫会号召中国妇女不仅自己不要吸烟，而且要发挥其在家庭中的作用，劝说其他成员也不要吸烟；今后将进一步采取措施禁止吸烟。
