Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 27th.

The atmosphere in the Capital Gymnasium tonight was electric, with roaring cheers from the audience reaching a crescendo that rivaled the excitement of the 1981 World Ice Hockey (Group C) Championships. It was with the support of these thousands of spectators that the Chinese women's volleyball team ultimately defeated the world powerhouse, Cuba, with a score of 3-1, securing the championship title of the Sea Swallow Cup International Women's Volleyball Semifinals.

The four teams—China, Cuba, the United States, and Japan—who had arrived in Beijing from Chengdu on the 25th, resumed their competition in the Capital Gymnasium on the 26th. Cuba's women's volleyball team defeated the United States 3-0, while China's team won a hard-fought five-set match against Japan.

In the afternoon of the 27th, the U.S. women's volleyball team defeated Japan, securing third place in the competition.

Tonight's final match between China and Cuba was widely anticipated as a one-sided affair. However, the actual progression of the game surpassed everyone's expectations. The Cuban team, which had not lost a single set in their official matches in China, faced fierce resistance from China after winning the first set. The enthusiastic support from the audience further bolstered the Chinese team's performance. Players like Wu Dan and Li Yunwu's quick attacks and back-spikes, as well as Xu Xin and Li Guojun's powerful spikes from the number four position, repeatedly broke through Cuba's high block.

China's women's volleyball team, fueled by this momentum, secured three consecutive sets (15-8, 15-6, 15-10), turning the game around and emerging victorious.

The individual awards for this competition were as follows: Best Coach - Hu Jin (China); Best Player - Xu Xin (China); Best Spiker - Louise (Cuba); Best Setter - Naka Kumi (Japan); Best Blocker - Kim Odin (USA).

　　观众呐喊助我国女排威风
    战胜古巴队获四强赛冠军
    本报北京５月２７日讯  记者吴骅、陈昭报道：今晚的首都体育馆内人声鼎沸、气氛热烈，一浪高过一浪的助威声、呐喊声只有１９８１年世界冰球（Ｃ组）锦标赛的情景能与之媲美。正是在这数千观众的支持下，中国女排终以３∶１击败了世界劲旅古巴队，从而捧走了海燕电视杯国际女排四强赛的冠军杯。
    ２５日从成都转道来京的中国、古巴、美国、日本四支女排，２６日又在北京首都体育馆拉开了争夺的战幕。古巴女排以３∶０战胜了美国队，中国队苦战５局险胜日本队。
    ２７日下午，美国女排战胜了日本队后，获得了本次比赛的第三名。
    今晚的决赛，中古两队的交战普遍被人们认为是一边倒的局面，然而比赛的进展却超出了人们的预料。此次来华在正式比赛中未失一局的古巴队，在先胜一局后，即遭到了中国队的顽强抵抗，观众的有力声援也使中国女排发挥得愈加出色，巫丹、李云武的快攻和背溜、许新和李国君的四号位强攻也屡屡突破古巴队的高拦网。
    中国女排一鼓作气，连夺３局（１５∶８、１５∶６、１５∶１０），反败为胜。
    获得本次比赛单项奖的是：最佳教练员胡进（中国）；最佳运动员许新（中国）；最佳扣球手路易丝（古巴）；最佳二传手中田久美（日本）；最佳拦网手金·奥登（美国）。
