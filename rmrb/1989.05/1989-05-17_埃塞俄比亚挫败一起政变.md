Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, May 16th

Ethiopia's Council of State announced tonight that it had thwarted a military coup attempt today.

A statement from the Council of State, released by the Ethiopian News Agency, said that some senior military officers attempted to overthrow the government and establish a military regime.

The statement said that the coup attempt was also aimed at satisfying some generals' desire for political power and pushing the country into an even more difficult situation, creating a favorable atmosphere for domestic and foreign enemies.

The coup attempt occurred a few hours after Ethiopian President Mengistu Haile Mariam left for a visit to East Germany this afternoon.

This afternoon, gunshots were heard in the capital, Addis Ababa, and helicopters circled overhead. All roads leading to the Ministry of Defense were blocked. Tanks and armored personnel carriers loaded with soldiers were deployed at key locations in the capital. The airport has been closed by soldiers.

　　埃塞俄比亚挫败一起政变
    新华社亚的斯亚贝巴５月１６日电（记者陈进军）埃塞俄比亚国务委员会今晚宣布，今天挫败了一起军事政变阴谋。
    埃塞俄比亚通讯社播发的国务委员会一份声明说，一些高级军官企图推翻政府，建立一个军政权。
    声明说，这次政变阴谋也是为了满足一些将军们对政治权力的渴望，同时把这个国家推到更加困难的境地，造成一个有利于国内外敌人的气氛。
    这次政变是在埃塞俄比亚总统门格斯图今天下午离开这里前往民主德国访问后数小时内发生的。
    今天下午，埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴响起了枪声，直升机在上空盘旋。通往国防部的所有道路被封锁。坦克和满载士兵的装甲运兵车部署在首都的重要部位。机场已被士兵关闭。
