The Hunsuan County Traffic Bureau in Shanxi Province has 368 forged personal seals, with 65 different surnames. These were illegally made to misappropriate state funds.

It is reported that from 1984 to 1987, the state allocated a total of 5.81 million yuan in project funds to this bureau to help the local people escape poverty and achieve prosperity.

According to materials provided by the Yanan Region Audit Bureau, the leaders of the Hunsuan County Traffic Bureau used forged documents, private seals, false reports, and fake accounts to embezzle and misappropriate state project funds totaling 480,000 yuan over four years.

From 1985 to 1987, this bureau built 58 residential rooms, with a total investment of 208,000 yuan, far exceeding the investment approved by the county planning commission. These excess funds were misappropriated from project funds totaling 140,000 yuan, as well as from transportation management station fees, annual management fees, profits, and the profits from the returned youth market. After the completion of the residential buildings, four leaders of this bureau occupied 12 of the rooms.

It is reported that this case is currently under investigation and handling.

　　浑源交通局一丑闻    
    刻制假私章支公款
    据新华社太原５月７日电  （记者池茂花）山西省浑源县交通局有３６８枚假私人图章，编造了６５个姓氏。这是他们为了挪用乱支国家专项款非法刻制的。
    据悉，国家为了使山区人民尽早脱贫致富，从１９８４年到１９８７年，共拨给这个局５８１万元工程款。
    据雁北地区审计局提供的材料：浑源县交通局的领导为了挪用专款修建安乐窝，采用制假单、私刻假图章、做假表、造假帐等弄虚作假手段，４年来共挪用乱支国家工程款等共４８万余元。
    这个局从１９８５年到１９８７年，建家属房５８间，总投资２０．８万多元，远远超过县计委批准的投资。这些超支费用除挪用工程专款１４万余元之外，还挪用运输管理站收费、历年管理费留成和利润分成以及知青门市部利润等。家属宿舍建成后，这个局４位领导占用１２间。
    据悉，此案目前正在调查处理中。
