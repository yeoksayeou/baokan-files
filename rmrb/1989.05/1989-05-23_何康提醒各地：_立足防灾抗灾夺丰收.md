	He Kang reminds all regions: Prepare for disasters and strive for a bountiful harvest

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 23rd — Minister of Agriculture He Kang recently called on all regions to pay attention. He said that various natural disasters are likely to occur in the latter half of this year, and preparations should be made in advance to focus on disaster prevention and mitigation to achieve a bountiful harvest.

	He Kang made these remarks on the 22nd at the national "three summer" fieldwork meeting. He introduced that the main disasters affecting agricultural production in the latter half of this year are floods, droughts, typhoons, and low-temperature frost damage. According to relevant departments' forecasts, from May to August, there may be floods in parts of the Huaihe River basin and southern China; some areas in northeastern China and the Sichuan Basin may experience drought due to insufficient rainfall; it is estimated that 8 to 10 tropical storms and typhoons will make landfall in China in the latter half of the year, which is more than in previous years; the temperature in Northeast China from June to August will be lower than the average, which is not conducive to crop growth, and some areas may experience low-temperature frost damage.

	Based on the above forecasts, regions such as southern North China, western Northeast China, most of Northwest China, eastern Southwest China, and northern South China must be prepared for long-term drought resistance.

	He Kang said that according to the pest and disease forecast, the main pests and diseases of grain and cotton in this autumn will occur more frequently. In particular, rice sheath blight, rice leafhoppers, rice stem borers, corn borers, second-generation cotton bollworms, locusts, cotton red spiders, cotton leafworms, cotton red spiders, and cotton stink bugs will occur more frequently. Among them, the area affected by rice sheath blight and rice leafhoppers may exceed 200 million mu; the area affected by the first and second generations of rice stem borers will reach 100 million mu.

	He Kang said that to minimize the damage, the agricultural sector should strengthen the forecasting and reporting of various disasters, give full play to the initiative of plant protection companies, plant hospitals, plant protection professional teams, and professional households, actively communicate agricultural supply channels, and do a good job of combining plant protection technology and pesticide supply. He Kang also called on relevant departments to strengthen the management and quality inspection of the pesticide market, prevent fake and substandard pesticides from entering the market, and resolutely protect the interests of farmers.

　　何康提醒各地：
    立足防灾抗灾夺丰收
    据新华社武汉５月２３日电  （记者焦然、施勇峰）农业部部长何康日前提请各地注意，今年下半年各种自然灾害将偏重发生，要及早做好准备，立足防灾抗灾夺丰收。
    何康是２２日在全国“三夏”现场工作会议上讲这番话的。他介绍说，今年下半年影响农业生产的主要灾害是涝、旱、台风和低温冻害。据有关部门预报，５—８月我国淮河流域、华南南部的部分地区可能发生洪涝灾害：华南东北部和四川盆地的一些地区因降水偏少、可能出现旱象；下半年预计登陆我国的热带风暴和台风有８—１０个，较往年偏多；东北地区６—８月温度将较常年偏低，不利于农作物生长，其中部分地区还可能出现低温冷害。
    根据上述预测，华北南部、东北西部、西北大部以及西南东部和华南北部地区，必须树立长期抗旱的思想准备。
    何康说，据病虫预报测报部门预计，今年秋季粮食、棉花主要病虫害将偏重发生。特别是水稻纹枯病、稻飞虱、水稻二化螟、三化螟、玉米螟、二代粘虫、蝗虫、棉红蜘蛛、棉蛉虫、棉红蛉虫和棉盲蝽象等将偏重发生。其中水稻纹枯病、稻虱发生面积可能超过２亿亩次；早稻一、二代化螟发生面积将达１亿亩次。
    何康说，为尽量减少危害，农业部门要加强对各种灾害的预测预报工作，充分发挥植保公司、植物医院、植保专业队和专业户的积极性，积极沟通农资供应渠道，做好植保技术和农药供应相结合的配套服务。何康还吁请有关部门加强农药市场管理和质量检测，防止伪劣农药流入市场，坚决保护农民利益。
