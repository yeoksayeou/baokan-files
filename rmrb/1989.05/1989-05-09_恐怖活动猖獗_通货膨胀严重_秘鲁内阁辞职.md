Terrorism rampant, inflation severe

The Peruvian cabinet, led by Prime Minister Villanueve, submitted its resignation to President Garcia yesterday. President Garcia has accepted the resignation and authorized First Vice President Sanchez to form a new cabinet.

According to Peruvian political analysts, the resignation of the Villanueve cabinet is related to the recent assassinations of two congressmen.

On the other hand, the economic situation in Peru continues to deteriorate. Inflation over the past 12 months has accumulated to 4,329%. This is likely another factor contributing to the cabinet's resignation.

Peru's president interrupted his visit to Brazil and returned home yesterday.

　　恐怖活动猖獗　通货膨胀严重    
    秘鲁内阁辞职
    本报加拉加斯５月９日电  记者朱满庭报道：以比利亚努埃瓦总理为首的秘鲁内阁昨天向加西亚总统提出辞职，加西亚总统已接受了这一辞职，并授权第一副总统桑切斯组织新内阁。
    据秘鲁政治分析家分析，比利亚努埃瓦内阁辞职与前些天两名众议员被暗杀有关。
    另一方面，秘鲁经济形势继续恶化。近１２个月的通货膨胀已累积高达４３２９％。这大概也是促成内阁辞职的另一个因素。
