The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act is a U.S. law that requires auditors to pay special attention to a company's bribery activities. Bribery activities exist to varying degrees in different countries. The English word "bribery" means giving money or providing services to someone to get them to do something beneficial for a company. Under normal circumstances, this should not be done.

In some countries, such behavior is considered a normal "business practice." In the United States, such behavior is illegal. In 1977, the U.S. federal government enacted the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which stipulates that any U.S. company (including its joint ventures and agents) bribing foreign government officials is an illegal act. Companies found guilty of bribery can be fined up to $1 million, while individuals can be fined $10,000 and sentenced to five years in prison.

When investigating payments made to foreigners, U.S. authorities discovered that some companies, in order to conceal improper business dealings, falsified accounting records that did not reflect the true intentions of these transactions. Therefore, the act includes provisions on accounting records and internal controls: a company's books, records, and accounts must accurately, fully, fairly, and reasonably reflect the company's business and assets. The act also clearly stipulates that companies must establish and maintain a sound internal control system. If bribery occurs, the accounting records must reflect and expose it. Through the internal control system, it is possible to avoid and correct the occurrence of bribery and other immoral behaviors.

　　美国《国外贿赂行为法案》
    《国外贿赂行为法案》是美国法律中要求审计人员对企业的贿赂行为予以特别注意的法案。企业的贿赂行为在世界各国不同程度地存在着。英语ｂｒｉｂｅｒｙ的意思即是，给某人金钱或提供服务，以便让他去做对某一公司有利的事情。正常情况下这种事是不应该做的。
    在某些国家，这种行为被认为是一种正常的“经营惯例”。在美国，这种行为是违法的。１９７７年美国联邦政府制定（《国外贿赂行为法案》）规定，任何美国公司（包括与其合营者和代理商）对外国政府官员行贿是非法行为。对行贿的公司处以交纳１００万美元的罚金，而个人则处以１万美元的罚金和５年的监禁。
    美国当局在调查支付外国付款时，发现有些公司为了隐瞒不正当的业务，伪造会计记录，不反映这些业务的真正意图。因此法案在会计记录和内部控制方面做了规定：公司的账簿、记录和账户必须正确、详细、公正、合理地反映公司的业务和财产；法案还明确公司内部要建立健全内部控制的规定，要求公司必须设计和保持充分的会计内部控制系统，一旦出现贿赂行为，会计记录必须予以反映和揭露。通过内部控制系统可以避免和纠正贿赂等不道德行为的产生。
