Focus on the "Vegetable Basket" but Do Not Forget Pollution Prevention – Over 3 Million Mu of Pollution-Free Vegetables

Reporter Jiang Jianke reports from Beijing: While focusing on the "vegetable basket" project, do not forget to develop "pollution-free vegetables" – this is the appeal made by Senior Agricultural Technician Yi Qi of the Ministry of Agriculture during a recent interview.

From the end of 1983 to the present, the six main varieties of "pollution-free vegetables" in China, such as cabbage, tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers, kale, and beans, have developed to over 3 million mu. However, due to issues with the management system for vegetables, pesticide management, and pest control technology, incidents of vegetable poisoning and contamination frequently occur, directly threatening people's health.

Yi Qi said that the key to developing "pollution-free vegetables" is to strengthen various technical measures, cultivate a technical team, and eliminate the pollution of vegetables by "three wastes" and heavy metals. It is also necessary to limit the use of wastewater for irrigation.

　　抓“菜篮子”勿忘防污染
  　无公害蔬菜逾３００万亩
    本报北京５月２６日讯  记者蒋建科报道：抓菜篮子工程请不要忘记发展“无公害蔬菜”——农业部高级农艺师易齐日前接受采访时发出这样的呼吁。
    从１９８３年底至今，全国的“无公害蔬菜”，如大白菜、西红柿、黄瓜、青椒、甘蓝、菜豆６种主要品种已发展到３００多万亩。然而，由于蔬菜经营体制、农药经营体制及病虫害防治技术等方面的原因，各地蔬菜中毒和污染事件屡有发生，直接威胁着人们的健康。
    易齐说，发展“无公害蔬菜”的关键是要加强各种技术措施，培养一支技术队伍，同时要清除“三废”和重金属等对蔬菜的污染，限制用废水浇菜。
