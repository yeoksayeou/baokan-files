Title: How Japan Develops Its Education System

Japan's approach to developing its education system is characterized by a strong emphasis on education, substantial investment, and a well-structured teacher corps. These elements have contributed to the country's educational achievements. Recently, the author had the opportunity to interview Suzuki Isao, the former Director-General of the Agency for Cultural Affairs and the current Director of the National Institute for Educational Research.

		Emphasizing Education Becomes a Social Norm

Suzuki pointed out that the Japanese Constitution stipulates three fundamental obligations for citizens: receiving education, working, and paying taxes. Parents who prevent their children from receiving education are committing a legal offense. Since the implementation of compulsory education, there has not been a single case of parents violating this law.

In Japan, the most beautiful buildings in rural areas are schools, not administrative offices. Even in the densely populated city of Tokyo, schools have spacious playgrounds.

Japan's universal education has reached a high level. Since the end of World War II, the enrollment rates for primary and secondary school-aged children have been above 99%.

The development of education requires the collective effort of all people to recognize the importance of education. Japan's serious attention to education began with the Meiji Restoration. The idea of valuing education has gradually taken root in people's minds. Despite experiencing turbulent times, people's recognition of the importance of education has not changed. Valuing education has become a fundamental concept in Japan, and the entire nation's emphasis on education is a prerequisite for the smooth development of the education sector.

		Education is an Expensive Endeavor

The prerequisite is only the foundation for developing education, but the fundamental guarantee lies in systematic policies and effective measures.

It is no secret that education is an expensive endeavor. The economic benefits of educational investment are not immediately apparent. The relationship between education and money primarily involves two issues: whether to invest more in education and how to ensure and expand the financial resources for education.

Japan's peak period of significant investment in education after the war was not in the 1960s when the economy was highly developed, but in the early 1950s when the economy was still underdeveloped and had just overcome inflation. From 1950 to 1952, the total expenditure on public education (excluding private schools) increased by 29.2%, 34.2%, and 26.8% respectively compared to the previous year. In 1947, Japan was in the midst of post-war inflation, and the compulsory education system was extended from six to nine years starting that year. The Constitution stipulates that compulsory education is free. Under the conditions of Japan's limited financial resources at the time, the ability to significantly increase investment in education required great courage and determination.

Japan's public education investment is not solely dependent on the national budget but is shared by the national, prefectural, and municipal governments. The principle is to raise funds for educational expenditures from the national, prefectural, and municipal tax revenues. The majority of public education expenditures are borne by local finances. The primary source of funds for local education is taxation.

To reduce the burden on national and local finances for educational funds, the state actively encourages and supports private schools. In Japan, 28% of high schools and 75% of universities and junior colleges are private. The state also provides some subsidies to private schools, but the burden is still lighter compared to fully state-funded education, thus indirectly expanding the financial resources for education.

		Education and Teachers

Suzuki continued, "To improve education, a corps of teachers with relatively high qualifications and a commitment to the education sector is needed."

Teachers in national and public schools are civil servants. Civil servants in Japanese society enjoy the trust of the people, have stable incomes, and hold relatively high social status.

To become a teacher, one must pass a rigorous national examination. Teachers must first obtain a teaching license. This ensures the quality of teachers. In Japan, teachers with a university degree or higher account for 90.8% in primary schools, 97% in secondary schools, and 92.8% in high schools.

The relatively high income of teachers in national and public schools is also a crucial factor in maintaining a stable teaching corps. University graduates who become teachers earn an average monthly salary of 190,000 yen in their first year, which is higher than the starting salary of new employees in first-tier companies. In addition, there are allowances for dependents, housing, and commuting. In a society that values men over women, the equal pay for male and female teachers in national and public schools is very attractive to young women. The proportion of female teachers in various types of schools averages 41.1% (1985 statistics). In 1974, Japan enacted a special measure to secure teacher talent, providing preferential treatment for teacher salaries and legally guaranteeing relatively high incomes for teachers.

That evening, coincidentally, NHK television broadcasted a special program on world education.

Education reform has become a global trend. The Japanese education sector is most concerned with how to learn from European and American experiences to enhance imagination and emphasize individuality. Considering China's 220 million illiterate and semi-illiterate population and the average education level of 5 years, what lessons can we learn from the educational practices of other countries?

　　日本怎样发展教育事业    
     ——访日本国立研究所所长铃木勋
    本报记者  于青
    “中国幅员辽阔，人口众多，经济和教育发展水平各地区之间有差别。正像为治理通货膨胀，要采取产业倾斜政策一样，为了提高民族素质，改变教育落后状况，对教育也要适时采取倾斜政策，重点发展，这样才能满足国家对优质人才的需求。”这是曾任职日本文化厅长官、现任国立教育研究所所长铃木勋先生说的一段话。记者最近采访了他。
    　　　　重视教育蔚然成风
    铃木先生说，日本宪法规定，日本人有三大义务：接受教育、劳动、纳税。家长阻止子女接受教育，就是违法行为。从实行义务教育制度以来，还没有发生过一起这种违法案例。
    在日本，乡村中最漂亮的建筑物是学校，而不是行政机关。即使在寸金之地的东京，学校也有宽阔的操场。
    日本的普及教育已经达到很高程度。战后以来，日本小学中学的适龄儿童和少年的入学率都在９９％以上。
    发展教育首先要人们齐心，使所有的人都从心里认识到教育的重要性，日本认真重视教育是从明治维新开始的。重视教育的思想不断深入人心。尽管经历了动乱的年代，但人们对教育重要性的认识没有变化。重视教育在日本已经蔚然成风，成为人们的基本观念。全体国民重视教育是教育事业顺利发展的前提条件。
    　　　　教育是个费钱的事业
    前提条件只是为发展教育奠定良好的基础，但发展教育的根本保证在于系统的政策和有力的措施。
    毋庸讳言，教育是个费钱的事业。教育投资的经济效益短期内不能见效。教育和钱的关系，主要涉及两个问题：一个是肯不肯把较多的钱投在教育上，另一个是怎样保证和扩大教育投资的财源。
    日本战后大力增加对教育投资的高峰期，并不是在经济取得高度发展的６０年代以后，而是在刚刚摆脱通货膨胀的困扰，经济还不发达的５０年代初期。从１９５０年到１９５２年的三年中，公共教育（除私立学校外）的经费总额分别比前一年增加２９．２％、３４．２％、２６．８％。１９４７年，日本正处在战后通货膨胀之中，义务教育制度从这一年开始，由６年延长到９年。宪法规定义务教育免费。在当时日本财力不充足的情况下，能大幅度增加对教育的投资，需要极大的勇气和决心。
    日本的公共教育事业投资，并不是全部依赖国家预算。而由国家、都道府县、市町村分担。原则上是从国家、都道府县、市町村的税金等岁入中，筹措用于教育事业的经费。公共教育经费支出中，大部分由地方财政负担。地方办教育的财源主要是靠税收。
    为减少国家和地方财政对教育经费的负担，国家积极鼓励和扶持私立学校。日本２８％的高中，７５％的大学和短期大学是私立的。国家对私立学校也给予一定补助，但毕竟比全由国家包下来负担要轻，无形中扩大了教育经费的财源。
    　　　　教育和教师
    铃木先生接着说，搞好教育，需要有一支素质较高，安心教育事业的教师队伍。
    国立公立学校的教师属于公务员。公务员在日本社会受到人们的信赖，收入稳定，有较高的社会地位。
    想成为教师，要通过严格的国家考试。教师首先要考取许可证。这样可以保证教师的素质。日本具有大学以上学历的教师，在小学占９０．８％，中学占９７％，高中占９２．８％。
    国立公立学校的教师有较高的收入，也是教师队伍稳定的重要因素。大学毕业成为教师，第一年度平均月工资１９万日元，高于新入第一流企业职员的工资。除此之外，还有抚养补助、住宅补助、通勤补助等。在重男轻女的日本社会，国立公立学校教师的工资男女平等，这对女青年很有吸引力。女教师在各种学校所占比例，平均为４１．１％（１９８５年统计）。１９７４年，日本制定了确保教师人才的特别措施法，对教师工资采取优待措施，从法律上保证教师有较高的收入。
    采访当天晚上，恰逢ＮＨＫ电视频道播出世界教育专题特别节目。
    教育改革成为当今世界潮流。日本教育界谈论最多的是，如何借鉴欧美的经验，提高人的想象力，注重个性。想到中国２．２亿文盲、半文盲，人平均教育程度５年的现实，我们能从外国发展教育的作法中得到哪些启示呢？
