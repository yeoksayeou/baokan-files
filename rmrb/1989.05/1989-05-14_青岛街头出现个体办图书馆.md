Several privately-run libraries have sprung up on the streets of Qingdao, attracting a large number of readers.

These libraries, with various names such as bookstores or reading societies, are mostly run by individual young people. They use their own funds to rent small houses in areas with a high concentration of residents and purchase a batch of books for readers to borrow. The operating methods of these libraries are diverse; some require a fee for a borrowing card, while others charge by the day. The prices are quite reasonable. The Sanlian Reading Society located on Yan'an Road, for example, charges eight yuan for a borrowing card that is valid for a year.

　　青岛街头出现个体办图书馆
    新华社青岛五月十四日电（记者刘海民）十几家由个体办的图书馆，活跃在青岛市的街头巷尾，吸引了大批读者。
    这些名称不一的书屋或读书社，大都是些个体青年办的，他们用自筹的资金，在居民比较集中的地方租赁了一些临街的小屋，并购买了一批图书供读者借阅。这些图书馆的经营方式多样，有的是交款办借书证，有的是按天数收钱，其价格都比较公道。坐落在延安路上的三联读书社，交八元钱办个借书证可以用一年。
