A construction project for an "art gallery" in a certain city in Hubei Province, which had been announced as halted, was secretly resumed in March this year. It was caught and completely halted by the audit department during a tracking audit.

Tracking audits are an important measure taken by Hubei Province's audit departments to participate in rectification and compression of construction scales. Just after the "thunder" of rectification and compression of construction projects, some construction units, harboring hopes of luck, began to repeat the old trick of "stopping in name but continuing in secret." The Hubei Provincial Audit Bureau promptly captured this information and immediately deployed tracking audits across the province. From the decision to halt or slow down construction to the completion of all follow-up work, all halted or slowed construction projects were placed under strict audit supervision.

Since last October, the province has conducted tracking audits on 473 halted or slowed construction projects, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of announced halted or slowed projects. During the audits, it was found that 52 projects had not truly stopped, and strong measures were taken to order 38 projects to cease construction.

The Hubei Provincial Audit Bureau requires audit personnel to go deep into the construction sites, conduct on-site inspections, supervise the withdrawal of construction teams, clean up the sites, settle debts, and return unarrived materials and equipment, truly making the projects "dismount." After the swimming pool project in Xianning Region was announced as halted, audit personnel went to the site and found exposed steel bars in concrete pillars and poorly managed construction materials. They suggested that the construction unit pour concrete over the exposed steel bars and build a wall to protect the construction materials, reducing losses.

According to the audit department, out of the 473 projects under tracking audit, 14 projects have not yet stopped. They are reporting the situation to government leaders on one hand; on the other hand, they are working with the construction units to urge them to stop work as soon as possible.

### 杜绝停缓建项目再上  湖北省实行跟踪审计

    杜绝停缓建项目再上
    湖北省实行跟踪审计
    本报武汉5月30日电  湖北省某市一个被宣布停建的“艺术厅”工程，今年3月刚刚偷偷恢复重建，就被审计机关在跟踪审计中“捉住”，彻底停工了。
    跟踪审计，是湖北省审计机关参与治理整顿、监督基建规模压缩的重要手段。治理整顿、压缩基建的“雷声”刚刚响过，一些心存侥幸的建设单位，又开始重演“明停暗建”的故伎。湖北省审计局及时捕捉到这个信息，立即在全省部署跟踪审计，从决定停缓建之日起，到整个善后工作完毕，把所有停缓建项目置于严密的审计监督之中。
    从去年10月至今，全省先后对473个停缓建项目实施了跟踪审计，占宣布停缓建项目总数60％以上。审计中，发现其中52个尚未真正停下来，采取强有力措施责令38个项目停止施工。
    湖北省审计局要求审计人员深入施工现场，实地查勘，监督施工队伍撤离、清理现场，清偿债权债务，清退尚未到货的器材设备等，真正使工程“下马”。咸宁地区游泳池工程宣布停建以后，审计人员深入现场，发现混凝土柱钢筋外露，基建物资保管不善，建议建设单位将外露钢筋浇注混凝土，建围墙保护基建物资，减少损失。
    据审计部门反映，跟踪审计的473个项目中，目前仍有14个项目没有停下来，他们一方面将情况向政府领导汇报；一方面正在做建设单位工作，促其尽快停工。（龚达发  纪实）
