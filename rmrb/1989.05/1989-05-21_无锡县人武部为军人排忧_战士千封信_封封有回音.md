Wuxi County Military Affairs Department Eases Soldiers' Worries: Every Letter from Soldiers Receives a Response

From January of last year to March of this year, the military affairs department of Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, received 1,689 letters from the troops, each of which received a response and every issue was addressed.

Wuxi County Military Affairs Department has been awarded the title of "National Advanced Unit for Military Enlistment Work" by the Ministry of National Defense. They treat the handling of soldiers' letters as a major task in supporting the construction of the troops and assisting the troops in doing a good job of soldiers' ideological work. On October 31 last year, soldier Lu Licheng from a certain unit in Cangzhou, Hebei, wrote a letter to express the difficulty his family was having in securing a foundation for building a house. After receiving the letter, Lin Yulong, the head of the county military affairs department, immediately went to Houzhuang Township, where Lu's family resides. He coordinated with the township military affairs department, the village construction office, and relevant village cadres to discuss and inspect the site on the spot, and decided on the foundation right away. The next day, construction of Lu's new house began.

To handle soldiers' letters well, various levels of military affairs departments in Wuxi County have established family files for soldiers, keeping track of changes in soldiers' family members, economic situations, marriages, and other matters, and doing their best to help soldiers' families with their worries and difficulties. When the military dependents Ma Zixiang in Chaqiao Town wanted to set up a stall to do business, the head of the town's military affairs department took the initiative to help him obtain a business license. When Ma Zixiang's son, who was serving in the army, wrote a letter asking the military affairs department for help, his parents' stall had already started operating.

　　无锡县人武部为军人排忧
    战士千封信　封封有回音
    本报讯  江苏省无锡县人武部门从去年１月到今年３月止，先后收到部队来信１６８９封，封封有回音、件件有着落。
    无锡县人武部曾被国防部授予“全国征兵工作先进单位”称号，他们把处理好战士来信作为支持部队建设，协助部队做好战士思想工作的一件大事来抓。去年１０月３１日，驻河北沧州某部战士陆利成来信反映家中建房需要落实地基困难，县人武部长林雨龙接信后，立即前往小陆家所在的后宅乡，会同乡人武部、村镇建设办公室和有关村干部协商并实地勘察，当场拍板定下地基。第二天，小陆家的新楼就破土动工了。
    无锡县各级人武部门为了处理好战士的来信，普遍建立了战士家庭档案，及时掌握战士家庭人员、经济、婚姻等变化情况，尽力为战士家庭排忧解难。查桥镇军属马子香家想设摊做买卖，镇人武部部长得知后，主动为他家办妥了营业执照。当马子香在部队服役的儿子写信请人武部帮助时，父母办的摊点已开张营业了。
