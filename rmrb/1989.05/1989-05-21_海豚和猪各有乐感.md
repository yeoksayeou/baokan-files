Dolphins not only can focus on enjoying music, they even have their own unique musical preferences, much like music enthusiasts. This conclusion was reached by American scientist Dāi Ēn·Wǎkèniè'ěr after years of observation and research on dolphins in a specialized laboratory. It turns out that dolphins prefer classical music, especially the works of Bach. When they hear Bach's melodious and rich compositions, dolphins become gentle and affectionate, showing a very friendly attitude towards humans. However, when they hear rock music, dolphins become agitated and anxious.

Experiments have shown that not only dolphins raised in aquariums exhibit this characteristic, but dolphins living in natural environments do as well.

Interestingly, pigs have musical preferences that are completely opposite to those of dolphins. Pigs love rock music but dislike classical music. When they hear the works of Beethoven and Bach, pigs become impatient and roll around in discomfort.

　　海豚和猪各有乐感
    海豚不仅能专心欣赏音乐，甚至还像音乐迷一样，对音乐有其独特的爱好。这一结论是美国科学家戴恩·瓦赫涅尔在专门的实验室里经过对海豚的多年观察研究得出的。原来，海豚更喜欢的是古典音乐，尤其喜爱巴赫的作品，一听到巴赫悠扬浑厚的乐曲，海豚就会变得温顺可爱，含情脉脉，对人表现出十分友好的态度；而当听到摇滚乐时，海豚则心情烦躁，惶恐不安。
    实验证明，不仅海豚馆中饲养的海豚具有这一特点，在自然环境中生长的海豚也同样如此。
    有趣的是，动物当中猪对音乐的喜好则与海豚完全相反。猪只喜爱摇滚乐曲，非常讨厌古典音乐，一听到贝多芬和巴赫的作品，猪便不耐烦地滚动起来。
