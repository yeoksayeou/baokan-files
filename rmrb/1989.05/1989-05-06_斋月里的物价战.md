During the time of Eid al-Fitr, residents of Karachi were particularly excited. People dressed up to attend "Eid prayers," celebrating the completion of their fasting on one hand, and on the other, celebrating the success in curbing a price hike during this year's Ramadan due to the united efforts of consumers.

Due to severe floods in the "granary of the nation," Punjab Province, last year, which led to a significant reduction in grain production, and the recent drought in Sindh Province this spring, coupled with continuous inflation and the devaluation of the rupee, basic consumer goods in Karachi, which are usually cheaper than in other major cities, saw a sharp increase in prices since the beginning of Ramadan. Particularly, essential items like flour and rice saw price hikes of nearly 50%. Pakistan, known as the "fruit basket of Asia," usually has a variety of fruits and vegetables at affordable prices. However, at the beginning of Ramadan, prices of bananas, oranges, melons, onions, tomatoes, and cucumbers rose one after another, exceeding the tolerance level of consumers. A consumer lamented, "It seems we can only afford water now." Some neighborhoods saw organized consumer protests against the price hikes.

Karachi has two major political parties: the People's Party and the "Muhajir Qaumi Movement." Seeing an opportunity to win over voters, the Muhajir Qaumi Movement called on consumers to unite and resist high prices by boycotting shops that raised prices and set up dozens of "non-profit" sales points to sell basic food and daily necessities. In a short time, a large number of citizens flocked to these poorly equipped but affordable temporary stores, while other shops were deserted. The People's Party was not to be outdone. In addition to adopting similar measures, it also leveraged its position as the ruling party to influence the local government to impose price controls and penalize speculators who hoarded goods and drove up prices. As a result, other shops were forced to lower or restore their original prices. According to a survey by the largest English-language newspaper in Pakistan, *Dawn*, by late April and early May, the retail prices of flour, rice, milk, and bread had returned to their pre-Ramadan levels. Seasonal vegetables and fruits like watermelons, muskmelons, tomatoes, and onions had seen price drops of 100% to 400%, and other price increases had been largely controlled. Since consumers united to show their strength, few shop owners dared to raise prices arbitrarily, and those who did or refused to lower prices continued to face consumer boycotts and neglect.

　　斋月里的物价战
    本报记者  任毓骏
    在开斋节之际，卡拉奇的居民们显得格外兴奋，人们打扮一新，参加“会礼”，一方面庆祝斋功完成，另一方面则是庆祝在今年的斋月里，由于广大消费者团结一致，成功地抑制了一次物价上涨。
    由于去年“大粮仓”旁遮普省发生严重水灾造成粮食减产，今春信德省又出现旱情，再加之连续不断的通货膨胀，卢比贬值，今年进入斋月以来，物价一向比其他大城市便宜的卡拉奇却出现了基本消费品物价急剧上涨趋势，特别是一些人民必需品与往日相比贵得出奇。曾一度出现面粉供应紧张现象，大米价格上升近５０％。一向有“亚洲水果篮”美称的巴基斯坦本来水果、蔬菜种类繁多，价格便宜。但在斋月初期，香蕉、桔子、瓜类、洋葱、西红柿、黄瓜等的价格相继上涨，超过了人们能忍受的程度，一位消费者悲哀地说：“看来，除水以外，我们什么也买不起了。”有些街区出现了消费者有组织的示威游行，抗议物价上涨。
    卡拉奇有两个主要党派组织，一个是人民党，一个是“移民运动”。移民运动看到争取选民的好机会来了，于是号召广大消费者团结一致，抵制高物价，不去带头哄抬物价的商店购物，并组织了数十个“非赢利”售物处，销售基本食品和生活必需品。一时间，广大市民纷纷涌向这些设备较差但是物价低廉的临时商店，其他商店则门可罗雀。人民党也不甘示弱，除和“移民运动”一样采取同样的措施外，还利用自己是执政党的优势，影响当地政府出面限价，制裁哄抬物价的囤积居奇的奸商。如此一来，其他商店被迫降价或恢复原价。据巴基斯坦发行量最大的英文报纸《黎明报》调查统计，到４月底５月初，面粉、大米、牛奶、面包的零售价格已基本恢复到斋月前的价格，节令蔬菜、水果如西瓜、甜瓜、西红柿、洋葱等已分别降价１００％—４００％，其他有上涨趋势的物价也基本得到控制。自从广大消费者团结起来显示自己的力量后，很少有店主敢擅自提价，有所提价的或不愿降价的店主继续受到消费者的抵制和冷落。
