	Seriousness, Enthusiasm, and Practicality
	— A Record of Zhang Tongsheng, Director of Jinan Railway Bureau
	Yu Lu

	Some say he lacks enthusiasm and is hard to approach; some even suggest that he should smile at the job representative meeting...

	The face of Zhang Tongsheng, Director of Jinan Railway Bureau, is more stern than warm. When listening to reports, he wants to hear the truth. No matter who it is, if there is any exaggeration, he will shut it down with one sentence; when handling problems, he is decisive and clear, straightforward and frank.

	In July of last year, a newly built connecting line in the Xuzhou hub suddenly collapsed, causing the Xuzhou station to become paralyzed. Zhang Tongsheng, who had just returned from a business trip to Tai'an in the afternoon, immediately took a car to Xuzhou.

	At 23:00, he held a meeting in Xuzhou to listen to reports; at 3:00 in the morning, he went to the marshalling yard to study the relief plan; at 7:30 the next morning, he went to the sub-bureau to discuss measures for restoring the line; in the afternoon, he went to the site to command, continuing until late at night. During this time, he kept wiping his swollen eyes with a handkerchief.

	The secretary couldn't hold on any longer and dozed off in the car. The 56-year-old Zhang Tongsheng, with a hoarse voice, made a speech to the participants: "Railways are a large interconnected machine, link by link. One person's hard work brings joy to thousands of families, one person's negligence..."

	Someone reported, "The crane has a problem, the oil pipe has an issue."

	"Where are the people from the mechanical department?!" he asked. Then he explained that during a rush, some sacrifices have to be made. In fact, he had not slept for two days and two nights. The work originally planned for 5 days was completed by dawn on the third day.

	Zhang Tongsheng appears stern and deep on the outside, but his heart is like a burning flame. During the Cultural Revolution, he was once kicked by a colleague at the base level. Later, when this comrade saw him, he felt very embarrassed. Zhang Tongsheng did not mind; he greeted him warmly and chatted about family matters, saying: "This is the result of that disaster, not the responsibility of any one person." Once, he was presiding over an office meeting when the party secretary whispered a few words to him. His hand holding the manuscript shook slightly, then immediately returned to normal, continuing the meeting. A few days later, when someone asked about his mother's condition, it was known that his mother had passed away during that meeting. He only used the work break to handle the funeral simply. This is not because he is unfilial. Usually, no matter how busy or tired he is at work, as long as he is at home, he will feed his mother and wipe her body. He often remembers his mother's hard work in his childhood, washing clothes for others to support the family and send him to school.

	Zhang Tongsheng handles problems decisively, but he does not act arbitrarily. The Jinan West Station marshalling yard is busy with transportation, with a high density of trains, making it easy to cause accidents. In the spring of 1986, someone suggested to him the use of a new device called "speed limiter." During the discussion, some leaders and business personnel in the bureau expressed objections. He did not rush to make a decision but carefully understood the performance of this device. Once, during an on-site office meeting in Jinan, someone raised this issue again, and it was decided to first allocate 300,000 yuan for a trial. A few months later, he went to Jinan for an on-site inspection, and indeed, it was as good as its name! He called all the heads of the bureau, and 2.1 million yuan was finally approved, equipping 32 tracks of the marshalling yard with "new weapons." Not only did the number of marshalling accidents significantly decrease, but the marshalling efficiency also increased by 14%.

	Zhang Tongsheng is a director who is both stern and warm, serious and enthusiastic, ordinary and down-to-earth. He relies on his diligent and practical efforts to make his work stand out.

　　严肃·热情·实干
    ——记济南铁路局局长张同生
    于路
    有人说他缺乏热情，难以接近；甚至有人建议他在职代会上要面带笑容……
    济南铁路局局长张同生的脸上冷峻多于热情。听汇报要听实的，不管是谁，只要说的有水份，他一句话就顶回去；处理问题果断，态度鲜明，痛痛快快。
    去年７月，新建的徐州枢纽有条联络线突然塌陷，徐州站顿时陷入瘫痪。下午刚从泰安出差归来的张同生，当即乘车赶赴徐州。
    ２３点在徐州开会听取汇报；凌晨３点到编组场研究疏解方案；次日７点半到分局研究恢复线路措施；下午到现场指挥，持续到深夜。此间，他不停地用手帕擦着红肿的眼睛。
    秘书熬不住了，钻到汽车里打盹。５６岁的张同生沙哑着嗓子向参战者作动员：“铁路是个大联动机，环环相扣。一人辛苦万家欢乐，一人疏忽……”
    有人汇报：“吊车机有毛病，输油管出现问题。”
    “机务段的人哪里去了？！”他问。接着又解释突击时，就得作点牺牲。其实，他已两天两夜未合眼了。原计５天的活，第三天黎明就开通。
    张同生外表严肃深沉，内心却是火一样的情肠。“文革”中，他在基层曾被单位的一个同志踹了两脚，后来这个伙计见了他，很不好意思。他，不介意，见了面主动打招呼，拉家常，说：这是那场灾难带来的，又不是哪一个人的责任。一次他正主持机关大会，党委书记悄悄对他嘀咕了几句，他持稿件的手抖动了一下，马上又恢复平静，继续开会。几天后有人问及他母亲的病情，才知道他母亲就是在那次开会时过世的，他只用工作间隙，简单处理了后事。这并非他不孝。平时工作再忙再累，只要在家，就要给母亲喂饭擦身。他常念起小时母亲给人家洗衣养家糊口，供他上学的艰辛。
    张同生处理问题果断，并不独断专行。济南西站编组站运输繁忙，列车密度大，极易诱发事故。１９８６年春，有人向他建议使用一种叫“减速顶”的新设备。酝酿时，局里部分领导和业务人员表示异议。他没有急于拍板，详细了解这种设备的性能。一次在济南现场办公，有人又提出这个问题，讨论决定先拿出３０万元试点。几个月后，他到济南现场考察，果然名副其实！他把路局的头头脑脑都召了去，２１０万元终于顺利地批了下去，３２股道的调车场，３０股上了“新武器”，不仅调车事故大大下降，而且调车效率提高了１４％。
    张同生，一个无情又有情，严肃又热忱，平平常常，实实在在的局长，靠着脚踏实地的勤奋，把工作搞得有声有色。
