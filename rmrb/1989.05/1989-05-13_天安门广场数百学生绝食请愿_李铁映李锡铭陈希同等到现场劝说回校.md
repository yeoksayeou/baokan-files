Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 14th.

On the afternoon of May 13th, hundreds of students from universities in the capital staged a hunger strike petition at Tiananmen Square.

The students' "Hunger Strike Declaration" stated that the hunger strike was to protest the government's indifferent attitude towards the Beijing students' class boycott and to protest the government's delay in dialogue with the Beijing universities' dialogue delegation.

It is understood that leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and relevant departments will continue to hold talks with some students and people from various circles in Beijing on May 15th. Responsible officials from the Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Office of the State Council, and the Letters and Visits Office have informed the Beijing university students who submitted the "Petition" on May 6th of this information on the morning of May 13th.

On the evening of May 13th, Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, invited some students and teachers for a talk. The hunger-striking students raised their demands during the talk. Yan Mingfu frankly expressed his views and said that he would report the students' demands to the Central Committee.

At 2:30 AM on May 14th, Li Tieying, Li Ximing, Chen Xitong, An Chengxin, Li Qiyang, Wang Jiatao, and Zhang Jianmin came to Tiananmen Square to persuade the students to return to school.

At the time of publication, the hunger-striking students were still sitting in the square.

    新华社北京５月１４日凌晨２时４０分电  １３日下午，首都高校数百名学生到天安门广场进行绝食请愿。
    绝食的学生宣读的一份“绝食宣言”说，这次绝食是为了抗议政府对北京学生罢课采取的冷淡态度，抗议政府拖延与北京高校对话代表团的对话。
    据悉，中共中央、国务院和有关部门负责人将于５月１５日继续同北京高校部分学生及各界人士座谈对话。中共中央办公厅国务院办公厅信访局负责人已于１３日上午将这一信息通知了５月６日送交“请愿书”的北京高校学生。
    １３日晚，中共中央书记处书记阎明复邀请部分学生、教师座谈。绝食的学生在座谈中提出了要求。阎明复坦诚地表述了自己的看法，并表示将把学生的要求如实向中央报告。
    １４日凌晨２时半，李铁映、李锡铭、陈希同、安成信、李其炎、汪家镠、张健民等同志到天安门广场劝说学生回校。
    到发稿时，绝食的学生仍在广场静坐。
