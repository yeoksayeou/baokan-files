When I was young, my grandmother told me she had dreamed of going to Beijing five times, but she never made it there in her lifetime, and instead went to heaven. Since then, Beijing has always been like a dream to me, and I often wonder when I will get to visit. He said this with a hearty laugh, scratching his head in a manner even more humorous than his own cartoon creations. This was his honest truth. Five years ago, he was just a farmer's son from a remote village in Sichuan. Now, this same farmer's son has not only fulfilled his grandmother's dream but also had his cartoon work "Waiting" selected for the prestigious China Art Museum, becoming a somewhat famous "warrior cartoonist." His name is Mother Jiankang.

In late 1985, Mother was assigned to a certain artillery regiment of the Beijing Military Region. When he first picked up his pencil, someone jokingly said, "With your laid-back attitude, you think you can draw? Keep dreaming." But Mother had his own plans. He thought, "Once you set your path, just keep pushing forward, and even dreams aren't far away." He lived in the barracks, loved the barracks life, and stored every vivid scene of barracks life in his memory and on his sketches.

However, achieving success in the career he had set his mind on was not easy. Without any cartoon references, he borrowed from everywhere and bought from bookstores. His painting skills were not strong, affecting his cartoon techniques, so he practiced sketching. In the summer, his drawings would often be dotted with sweat; in the winter, his hands would freeze, and he would rub them to warm up. In the barracks, he would often lie on his bed to draw, sometimes falling asleep while drawing.

Mother's cartoon works are filled with the rich atmosphere of military life. The characters in his cartoons often make viewers say, "This is a soldier."

This 23-year-old soldier, with his tenacious will and unyielding spirit, has achieved remarkable results. Over the past two years, he has published more than 100 cartoon works in newspapers such as the *People's Daily*, *Satire and Humor*, *Liberation Army Daily*, *Worker's Daily*, *China Youth Daily*, and *China Art Newspaper*. Now, he has gained some fame in the cartoon world and the military, receiving much praise.

　　“战士漫画家”母健康
     石津安　崔连玉
    “小时候外婆曾对我说过，她做过五次去北京的梦，可外婆活到终年也未去过北京，却上了天堂。从那以后，北京就像梦样总是缠着我，啥时能到北京玩一趟。”说到这，他憨厚地挠挠头，那神态比他创作出的漫画作品还要幽默。这是他的大实话。五年前，他曾是四川省较偏僻村庄的一位农家子弟，如今也正是这位农家子弟，他不仅实现了外婆的梦，而且去年他创作的漫画作品《等》一跃跨进了中国美术馆的大雅之堂，成了小有名气的“战士漫画家”，他叫母健康。
    小母一九八五年底被分配到北京军区某炮兵旅，当他刚刚拿起画笔时，有人善意地笑道：就你这个蔫劲还想去作画，做你的美梦吧。蔫人自有蔫主意。小母想，认准路只管闷头闯下去，就是梦也并非遥远。他生活在连队里，热爱连队的生活，把连队那些富有生活色彩的每个场景都储入他的记忆，留在他的笔下。
    然而，要想在自己认准的事业上干出一番成绩来，也决不是件易事。没有漫画方面的资料，他就四处借，到书店购买。绘画的功底不厚，影响了漫画创作的技巧，他就练习写生。夏天，常常是画纸上滴上了汗水；冬天，手冻得麻木了他就搓一搓。在连队，他总是趴在床边上作画，有时画着画进入梦乡。
    小母的漫画作品充满了军营生活的浓厚气息，漫画中战士的人物造型，往往使观画者这样说：这是军队的一员。
    这位二十三岁的战士，以顽强的毅力和不断进取的精神取得了丰硕成果。两年来，他陆续在《人民日报》、《讽刺与幽默》、《解放军报》、《工人日报》、《中国青年报》、《中国美术报》等报上发表了一百多幅漫画作品。如今在漫画界和军队中已有些名气，颇得称誉。
