Three years ago, China's traditional Chinese medicine market faced three major issues: a shortage of supply, poor quality, and a lack of sustainable solutions. How is the situation today? Overall, the supply has increased, and the variety of products has become more reasonable.

In 1983, the average consumption of traditional Chinese medicine per person in China was 0.5 kilograms. By 1988, this had increased to 0.75 kilograms. The national sales of patented traditional Chinese medicines reached 850 million yuan, doubling the figure from 1985.

In the past three years, the pharmaceutical industry has adjusted the structure of long-term and short-term products, changing the imbalance between production and sales. The supply of scarce medicines has increased, and the number of medicines in short supply nationwide has decreased from 120 in 1985 to around 80. Among these, there are more than 20 types of rare animal and plant medicines that are difficult to solve in the short term, as well as some imported medicines from the south. The formulation rate is over 90%. At the same time, the export of patented traditional Chinese medicines has expanded to more than 120 countries and regions. However, new situations and problems have emerged: "hundred industries" are involved in the market, leading to chaotic management.

Traditional Chinese medicine is a special commodity for treating diseases, and it is highly specialized. Since the implementation of free purchasing and selling, "hundred industries" have emerged. According to incomplete statistics, more than 20 systems in the country are involved in the trade of traditional Chinese medicine. According to the "Pharmaceutical Administration Law" issued by the state, whether the unit, collective, or individual, they must obtain approval and three certificates ("three certificates" refer to the qualification certificate issued by the medical and health department, the permit issued by the health department, and the business license issued by the industrial and commercial administration department) to engage in legal business. However, some people use business licenses for other commodities to engage in the trade of traditional Chinese medicine. Many people engage in wholesale, retail, and resale without any certificates. Even in the famous Hebei Anxian medicine market, there are more than 2,000 intermediaries without complete certificates. Among them, there are farmers, urban residents, as well as employees and retired workers. They buy and sell, making profits in between, and many have become "overnight millionaires." Some medicine dealers already have assets worth 500,000 yuan.

The emergence of these situations has seriously disrupted the normal operation of the traditional Chinese medicine market. Some varieties are in short supply, and multiple parties raise prices and compete for purchases, repeatedly reselling and hoarding, artificially exacerbating the shortage, causing prices to skyrocket. Take the commonly used white peony as an example. The purchase price last year was 2.5 yuan per kilogram, but after several resales and price increases by medicine dealers, it reached 13 yuan when it reached the patient, an increase of more than four times. The purchase price of cornelian cherries two years ago was 12 yuan per kilogram. After medicine dealers competed for purchases and resales, the highest retail price last year reached 300 yuan. The prices of medicines such as cowherb, angelica, and astragalus have also increased several times compared to two years ago.

The loss of control in the management of the traditional Chinese medicine market and the increase in unlicensed medicine dealers have made large and small medicine markets across the country active venues for the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard medicines. The Xian Kangfu Road medicine market, which operates more than 300 varieties of medicines, found nearly 40 varieties of counterfeit and substandard medicines in one day; a market in Shandong's Juye Chengcheng found 26 varieties of counterfeit and substandard medicines, accounting for 1/5 of the total market volume; a spot check of 104 varieties of medicines in Chengdu's Hehuachi Market found that 85 were fake.

The weakening of management has also led to the blind establishment of patented traditional Chinese medicine factories in various places. After a rectification in 1982, there were more than 430 patented traditional Chinese medicine enterprises nationwide. By 1987, there were already more than a thousand nationwide, with mutual imitation and repeated production. According to statistics, the number of medicines with the same name but different formulas or different names but the same formula accounts for about 1/3 of the total. As a result, small factories squeeze out large ones, and many traditional, high-quality, and therapeutic medicines cannot guarantee the production of raw materials.

Macro-control failures and short-term behavior of enterprises have led to many places engaging in predatory mining and hunting, and the destruction of traditional Chinese medicine resources is becoming increasingly serious. Relevant experts analyze that in one or two years, there will be more than a hundred varieties of medicines in short supply. The "three woods" (duzhong, thick-bark eucommia, and phellodendron) built with a large amount of state funds have had large areas of seedlings cut and peeled in the past one or two years, with some areas completely deforested. Nearly half of the "three woods" medicines that have been purchased are immature seedlings. In Guizhou Province, 11 medicinal plant bases with more than 100,000 plants have been completely destroyed in the buying frenzy. In Gansu's Minqin County, the wild licorice area was 700,000 mu in the 1960s, but now only 50,000 mu remain. Due to the excessive mining of licorice, large areas of grasslands in Ningxia have become desertified; the protection of medicines such as musk, bear, pangolin, snakes, bupleurum, and berberine has also been greatly impacted. Although many places have begun to take protective measures, the expected results have not been achieved. If strong measures are not taken to stop this situation quickly, China's traditional Chinese medicine market will experience significant fluctuations.

　　管一管中药材市场
    本报记者  万贵生
    三年前，我国中药材市场存在三大问题：一是货源紧缺，二是质量欠佳，三是后继乏术。今天情况如何呢？总的来说，货源增多，品种结构趋于合理。
    １９８３年，我国人均耗用中药材０．５公斤，１９８８年上升到０．７５公斤，全国中成药销售额达８５亿元，比１９８５年翻一番。
    近３年，药材部门调整了长短线品种结构，使产销失调的局面得以改变，紧缺药材产量增加，全国供应紧缺药材已由１９８５年的１２０种下降到８０种左右，其中包括短期内难以解决的２０多种资源稀少的动植物药材和部分进口南药，成方率达９０％以上。同时，中成药的出口已扩大到１２０多个国家和地区。然而又出现了新情况和新问题：“百业”经营，市场管理混乱。
    中药材是治病救人的特殊商品，专业性很强。自从实行自由购销后，出现“百业”经营。据不完全统计，全国有２０多个系统经营中药。按照国家颁布的《药品管理法》规定，药材经营者无论单位、集体和个人，都要经过审批和领取“三证”（医药主管部门发合格证，卫生部门发许可证，工商行政管理部门发营业执照）才算合法经营。可是，现在有的凭经营其他商品的营业执照做药材生意，有许多坐地批发、摆摊零售、来回贩运的，甚至连营业执照也没有。著名的河北安国药市上就有２０００多名证照不全的中间掮客。他们中有农民、城镇居民，也有在职人员和退休职工，买空卖空，从中牟利，不少人成了“暴发户”，有的药贩已拥有５０万元家当。
    这些情况的出现，严重干扰了药材市场的正常经营。某些品种紧缺，多方抬价抢购，轮番倒手，囤积居奇，人为地加剧了紧缺程度，使售价暴涨。以常用的白芍来说，去年收购价每公斤２．５元，可是经过药贩几次倒手、加价，到病人手里竟成了１３元，增加４倍多。山萸肉两年前的收购价每公斤１２元，经过药贩争购、倒卖，去年最高零售价达到３００元。牛藤、当归、黄芪等药材的价格都比两年前涨了好几倍。
    药材市场管理失控，无证药贩的大量增加，使全国大小药市成了制售伪劣药材的活跃的场地。西安康复路药材市场，共经营３００多种药材，一天就查出近４０种伪劣药材；山东菏泽鄄城药市一个集市就发现２６种伪劣药材，占全集上市量的１／５；成都荷花池市场抽查１０４种药材，有８５种是假的。
    管理上的削弱，还造成各地中成药厂盲目上马。１９８２年经过整顿后，全国剩下４３０多家中成药企业，到１９８７年，全国已有上千家，互相仿制，重复生产。据统计，全国同名异方或一方多名的药品，约占总数的１／３，结果是小厂挤大厂，很多传统、优质、治疗性药品的生产原料无法保证。
    宏观失控，企业短期行为，引发了许多地方掠夺性的采挖和捕猎，中草药资源破坏越来越严重。有关人士分析，一二年后将会有上百种药材严重短缺。国家花了大量资金建起来的杜仲、厚朴、黄柏等“三木”，近一二年大片幼苗被砍剥，有的剃了光头。在已收购的“三木”药材中，竟有近半数是未成熟的幼株。贵州省１０万株以上的中药材林场１１个，在抢购风中９个已荡然无存。甘肃民勤县６０年代野生甘草面积为７０多万亩，现在仅存５万亩。由于对甘草的过量采挖，宁夏的草原大面积沙化；麝、熊、穿山甲、蛇类、柴胡、黄苓等药材资源的保护工作也受到很大冲击。虽然不少地方开始采取保护措施，但未能达到预期效果。如不尽快采取强有力的办法加以制止，我国药材市场将会发生较大波动。
