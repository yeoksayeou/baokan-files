Zhao Ziyang Meets Gorbachev, Says Sino-Soviet Party Relations to be Based on Four Principles; Socialism Faces Serious Challenges, Reform is the Only Way Forward

Today at 5:40 PM, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and General Secretary Gorbachev held a friendly meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Zhao Ziyang introduced the relationship between the two parties, particularly the issues related to socialist reform.

Zhao Ziyang told Gorbachev, "Through the joint efforts of both China and the Soviet Union, this morning's high-level meeting between you and Comrade Deng Xiaoping was successfully realized. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee in 1978, Deng Xiaoping has been recognized both domestically and internationally as the leader of our party. During the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party last year, according to Deng Xiaoping's own wishes, he stepped down from his positions in the Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the Politburo. However, all party members believe that, for the sake of the party's cause, our party still needs Deng Xiaoping, his wisdom and experience, which are crucial to our party. Therefore, the First Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee solemnly decided that in the most important matters, Deng Xiaoping should still be in charge. Since the Thirteenth Congress, whenever we handle the most significant issues, we always report to Deng Xiaoping and seek his advice; Deng Xiaoping also always fully supports our work and the decisions made by our collective. This high-level meeting also signifies the natural restoration of relations between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The normalization of Sino-Soviet party relations is in the interests of the peoples of both countries and also in the interests of world peace. We are pleased about this."

Zhao Ziyang said, "I hope that in the future, the relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will develop smoothly on the basis of the following four principles: first, independence and self-reliance; second, complete equality; third, mutual respect; fourth, non-interference in internal affairs. These are also the principles that our party follows in dealing with relations with other communist parties. Our party believes that only by establishing relations between parties on the basis of these four principles can we have a mature, normal, and stable relationship. This is our summary of historical experience."

Zhao Ziyang emphasized the issue of socialist reform to Gorbachev.

He said, "The socialist movements in various countries are indeed at a critical juncture, facing many issues that require deep thought and resolution. Often, people (especially young people) raise such questions: does the socialist system have any superiority? I believe that the reason for such questions lies in two main aspects: on the one hand, some comrades do not fully understand a basic historical fact, that is, countries that established socialist systems through revolution were not the most developed countries at the time. Old China was a very underdeveloped country. Our starting point was much lower than that of developed countries like Western Europe and North America. Ignoring the basic fact that economic and cultural development is at different stages, one cannot draw correct conclusions. This is one aspect. On the other hand, how to build socialism, no one has experience, and we have indeed made mistakes in adhering to outdated practices. This is not a flaw in the socialist system itself, but a problem with our subjective guidance. After World War II, many major capitalist countries have been constantly adjusting their systems and policies to adapt to the use of new scientific and technological needs and, to some extent, to mitigate internal class contradictions; but we have been sticking to the original model, and this model was precisely formed under the special historical conditions of foreign armed intervention, encirclement, and war in the Soviet Union at that time. Since the problem has two aspects, our work should also have two aspects: on the one hand, we must do a good job of ideological education for the masses; on the other hand, we must reform the existing system and policies. Fundamentally, only through reform can the broad masses truly feel the superiority of socialism. Without reform, there is no way out. Socialism is facing serious challenges, and the only way to meet these challenges is through reform. We must, through reform, fully demonstrate the inherent superiority of the socialist system. This is the historical mission of contemporary Marxists."

He said, "The situations in various countries are different, and reforms cannot be forced to be the same. China's economic system reform has been underway for ten years. Problems that are relatively easy to solve have been addressed to varying degrees, and the results are good. Now, the most difficult problem is how to make the law of value function under the condition of public ownership. Without a market, one cannot talk about the law of value; if the prices of most commodities are not liberalized, the law of value cannot function; but in the case of commodity shortages, it is difficult to control the extent of price increases; and the shortage economy is precisely the inevitable result of the old system—this is a big contradiction. It seems that resolving this contradiction in a short period is very difficult, and we must be prepared for a long-term struggle and do each item of reform work more thoroughly. Now, we are rectifying the economic environment and order, reducing the scale of basic construction, adjusting industrial and enterprise structures, and improving and strengthening macro-control. We plan to achieve a better match between total supply and total demand through these efforts, creating more favorable conditions for further deepening the reform."

Zhao Ziyang said, "Political system reform should be roughly synchronized with economic system reform, neither too early nor too late. Without political system reform, economic system reform cannot proceed. In 1986, following Comrade Deng Xiaoping's suggestion, we conducted a relatively systematic study of political system reform, designing a plan. The Seventh Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee and the Thirteenth Congress adopted the guidelines and basic content of political system reform. The Thirteenth Congress believed that the key to China's political system reform is first and foremost the separation of party and government. We do not advocate the Western-style multi-party system, nor do we advocate the establishment of new political parties. The leadership role of our party among the Chinese people is historically formed. In China, without the leadership of the Communist Party, one cannot talk about upholding the socialist system, nor can one talk about the success of socialist reform. Like the economic system reform, China's political system reform must proceed from its own national conditions. China now has nine parties, one Communist Party, and eight democratic parties. The relationship between the nine parties is not the relationship between the ruling party and the opposition party in the West, but one of mutual cooperation, consultation, and supervision, with the Communist Party playing a leading role in this multi-party cooperation system. Some people ask, will one-party leadership affect democracy? Can effective supervision be conducted on the negative, unhealthy, and even some corrupt phenomena within the party and state organs? I believe this is not an insoluble problem. Our party has already led the people to formulate a constitution that conforms to socialist principles and has democratic substance. The key lies in two points: one is that the party must seriously adhere to the principle of 'the party must act within the scope of the constitution and laws' as stipulated in the party constitution, and the other is to actively formulate and strictly implement various relevant substantive laws and procedural laws. With these two points, I believe that Chinese citizens can enjoy true and practical democracy and freedom under the condition of one-party leadership. Of course, this is not a matter of one day or one night, and we must first start with solving problems that have already matured, and persistently do a large amount of solid work. I believe that China's political system reform will proceed steadily and actively on the track of democracy and the rule of law, thereby more fully mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of tens of millions of people, making our reform and construction truly the cause of the broad masses."

Zhao Ziyang also said, "Reform involves many important and complex theoretical and ideological issues. Therefore, the important thing is to proceed from the basic principles of Marxism, and with the changing situation, constantly develop theory and update ideas."

Gorbachev expressed great satisfaction with the meeting with Zhao Ziyang. He said, "A major event is taking place in our bilateral relations. This morning, I had a rich and satisfying meeting with Comrade Deng Xiaoping. We talked very well, and we are both satisfied." Gorbachev also said, "Both the Soviet Union and China are carrying out reforms. This reform is of great significance to both countries and to the world. The Soviet people are very concerned about China's reform, and the Soviet people highly appreciate the achievements made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Of course, reform is not easy, and one cannot expect to succeed in reform by just sleeping through it." Gorbachev also introduced to Zhao Ziyang the necessity of reform in the Soviet Union and the progress of reform and construction.

During the meeting, Gorbachev also suggested that in the future, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of China can exchange at different levels. Zhao Ziyang agreed with this. General Secretary Gorbachev invited General Secretary Zhao Ziyang to visit the Soviet Union. Zhao Ziyang gladly accepted the invitation.

After the meeting, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang hosted a banquet for General Secretary Gorbachev and his entourage at the Yangyuan Hall.

Politburo Standing Committee members Qiao Shi and Hu Qili, Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, and Department of International Liaison Director Zhu Liang, and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen attended the meeting and the banquet as hosts.

　　赵紫阳会见戈尔巴乔夫时说    
    中苏两党关系将以四项原则为基础    
    社会主义面临严重挑战不改革没有出路
    本报北京５月１６日讯  今天下午５点４０分，赵紫阳总书记和戈尔巴乔夫总书记在钓鱼台国宾馆进行了友好的会见。赵紫阳就两党关系，特别是就社会主义改革中的一些问题作了介绍。
    赵紫阳同志对戈尔巴乔夫同志说，经过中苏双方的共同努力，今天上午实现了你同邓小平同志的高级会晤。从１９７８年党的十一届三中全会以来，邓小平同志一直是国内外公认的我们党的领袖。在前年召开的党的第十三次全国代表大会上，根据邓小平同志本人的意愿，他从中央委员会和政治局常委的岗位上退下来了。但是，全党同志都认为，从党的事业出发，我们党仍然需要邓小平同志，需要他的智慧和经验，这对我们党是至关重要的。因此，十三届一中全会郑重作出决定：在最重要的问题上，仍然需要邓小平同志掌舵。十三大以来，我们在处理最重大的问题时，总是向邓小平同志通报，向他请教；邓小平同志也总是全力支持我们的工作，支持我们集体作出的决策。这次高级会晤，也就意味着中苏两党关系的自然恢复。中苏两党关系正常化，符合两国人民的利益，也符合世界和平的利益，我们为此感到高兴。
    赵紫阳说，我希望，今后中苏两党的关系将在以下四项原则的基础上顺利地发展，这就是：一、独立自主；二、完全平等；三、相互尊重；四、互不干涉内部事务。这也是我们党处理同其他国家共产党关系所遵循的原则。我们党认为，只有把党与党之间的关系建立在这四项原则基础之上，才能是成熟、正常和平稳的关系。这是我们对历史经验的总结。
    赵紫阳向戈尔巴乔夫着重谈了社会主义改革的问题。
    他说，各国的社会主义运动现在确实到了一个关键性的时期，面临着许多值得深思和需要解决的问题。常常有人（特别是青年人）提出这样的疑问：社会主义制度到底有没有优越性？我认为，所以会产生这样的疑问，主要有两方面的原因：一方面，有些同志不大了解这样一个基本的历史事实，就是通过革命建立了社会主义制度的国家当初都不是最发达的国家，旧中国就是一个很不发达的国家。我们的起点比西欧、北美等发达国家低得多。忽视经济文化处于不同发展阶段这个基本事实，就不能得出正确的结论。这是一方面。另一方面，怎样搞社会主义，大家都没有经验，同时，我们也确有墨守成规的错误。这不是社会主义制度本身的弊病，而是我们自己主观指导上的毛病。第二次世界大战以后，许多主要的资本主义国家都在不断地千方百计地调整自己的体制和政策，使之适应于采用新的科学技术的需要，并在一定程度上缓和了他们内部的社会阶级矛盾；但我们却在固守原来的模式，而这种模式又恰恰是当年苏联处于外国武装干涉、包围和战争那种特殊历史条件下形成的特殊模式。问题既然有两个方面，我们的工作也就应该有两个方面：一方面，切实做好对群众的思想教育工作；另一方面，必须对原有的体制和政策进行改革。从根本上说，只有通过改革，才能使广大群众切身体会到社会主义的优越性。不改革肯定是没有出路的。社会主义正面临着严重挑战，迎接挑战只有靠改革。我们必须通过改革，使社会主义制度充分显示它固有的优越性。这是当代马克思主义者的历史使命。
    他说，各国情况不同，改革也不可能强求一律。中国的经济体制改革已经进行了十年。比较容易解决的问题，几乎都已经在不同程度上展开，效果是好的。现在最困难的是如何在公有制条件下发挥价值规律的作用。没有市场，就谈不上价值规律；大部分商品的价格不放开，价值规律也无法起作用；但在商品短缺的情况下放开价格，涨价的幅度就很难控制；而短缺经济又恰恰是旧体制的必然结果——这是一个很大的矛盾。看来，在短时间内解决这个矛盾是很困难的，要准备打持久战，而且要把各项改革工作越做越细。现在，我们正在治理经济环境和整顿经济秩序，压缩基本建设规模，调整产业结构和企业结构，改善和加强宏观控制。我们打算通过这些工作，使总供给与总需求能够较好地衔接起来，为进一步深化改革创造较为有利的条件。
    赵紫阳说，政治体制改革应该同经济体制改革大体同步，超前不行，滞后也不行。不搞政治体制改革，经济体制改革也搞不下去。１９８６年，根据邓小平同志的提议，我们较为系统地研究了政治体制改革问题，设计了一个方案。十二届七中全会和十三大通过了政治体制改革的方针和基本内容。十三大认为，我国政治体制改革的关键首先是党政分开。我们不主张搞西方那种多党制，也不主张成立新的政党。我们党在中国人民中的领导作用，是历史形成的。在中国，没有共产党的领导，就谈不上坚持社会主义制度，也谈不上社会主义改革的成功。同经济体制改革一样，中国的政治体制改革也必须从自己的国情出发。中国现在有九个党，一个共产党，八个民主党派。九个党之间的关系，不是西方那种执政党和反对党的关系，而是互相合作、协商和监督的关系，而共产党则在这种多党合作制中起领导作用。有人问，一党领导会不会影响民主？能不能对党和国家机关内部的消极的、不健康的、以至某些腐败现象进行有效的监督？我认为，这决不是不可解决的问题。我们党已经领导人民制定了一部符合社会主义原则并且具有民主实质的宪法。关键是两条：一条是党要认真坚持党章所规定的“党必须在宪法和法律范围内活动”的原则，一条是积极制定并严格实施各种有关的实体法和程序法。有了这两条，我相信，我国公民就可以在一党领导的条件下享有真正的切实的民主和自由。当然这也不是一朝一夕之功，必须首先从解决业已成熟的问题开始，坚持不懈地做大量的扎扎实实的工作。我相信，中国的政治体制改革，将在民主和法制的轨道上，稳健而又积极地推进，从而更加充分地调动千百万群众的积极性和创造性，使我们的改革和建设真正成为广大群众切身的事业。
    赵紫阳还说，改革牵涉到许多重要而又复杂的理论问题和观念问题。因此，重要的问题是必须从马克思主义的基本原理出发，随着形势的变化，不断地发展理论，更新观念。
    戈尔巴乔夫对同赵紫阳的会见，表示非常高兴。他说，我们两国关系中正在发生一件重大的事情。今天上午，我和邓小平同志进行了内容丰富的会晤。谈得很好，我们都很满意。戈尔巴乔夫还说，苏中两国都在进行改革。这种改革对我们两国和全世界都具有重大意义。苏联人民很关心中国的改革，苏联人民高度评价中国人民在中国共产党领导之下取得的成就。当然，改革是不容易的，不能期望睡一觉醒来改革就成功了。戈尔巴乔夫还向赵紫阳介绍了苏联进行改革的必要性和改革、建设的进展情况。
    在会见中，戈尔巴乔夫还建议，今后，苏中两党可以在不同的级别上进行交流。赵紫阳对此表示赞同。戈尔巴乔夫总书记邀请赵紫阳总书记访问苏联。赵紫阳愉快地接受了邀请。
    会见结束后，赵紫阳总书记在养源斋设宴招待戈尔巴乔夫总书记及其一行。
