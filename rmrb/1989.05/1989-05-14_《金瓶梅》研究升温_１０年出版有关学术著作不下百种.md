Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 14th.

The study of "Jin Ping Mei," a renowned Ming Dynasty work often referred to as the "greatest strange book in the world," has become a subject of intense scholarly interest among mainland researchers.

This monumental work has been in circulation for over 400 years, yet it has been both praised and criticized by successive rulers, scholars, and the common people. For a long time, it was widely considered an "obscene book." Despite its tumultuous history and numerous attempts at suppression and destruction, it has continued to circulate in various editions.

In recent decades, mainland authorities have strictly controlled this book, making it difficult for scholars of "Jin Ping Mei" studies to obtain complete copies, leading to widespread complaints. In the 1980s, abridged and facsimile editions were permitted for publication, and in 1988, the state granted special permission for the Shandong Qi Lu Publishing House to print the complete Chongzhen edition. Mainland scholars rejoiced at this development. Even before the complete edition was published, more than 20,000 people had traveled long distances or sent requests to purchase it.

Some scholars affirm that "Jin Ping Mei" is a great work of realistic fiction, with immense intrinsic value and artistic achievement. Some even claim that "without 'Jin Ping Mei,' there would be no 'Dream of the Red Chamber.'" Others believe that the book exposes human vices, instilling fear and promoting moral education, and thus should be affirmed. However, there are also those who view "Jin Ping Mei" as a source of obscenity, arguing that its circulation does more harm than good.

Currently, the publication of academic works on "Jin Ping Mei" has become a hot commodity in mainland publishing. In the past decade, over 100 related research works have been published across various regions, with the Shandong Qi Lu Publishing House alone releasing more than 10 titles.

It is reported that renowned mainland scholars of "Jin Ping Mei" will arrive in Xuzhou next month to discuss the intricacies of the work with approximately 40 international "Jin Ping Mei" experts.

　　《金瓶梅》研究升温    
    １０年出版有关学术著作不下百种
    据中新社济南电（记者顾方东）被称为“天下第一奇书”的明代著作《金瓶梅》成为越来越多的大陆学者专门探讨的对象。
    这部巨著问世迄今已逾４００年，但历代统治者、文人学士以及平民百姓对其毁誉不一，并且在相当长的时间里被多数人谓之“淫书”。尽管《金瓶梅》命运多舛，几遭禁毁，但它仍以多种版本不断流传。
    近几十年来，中国有关部门对这部书的管制较为严格，研究“金学”的学者苦于找不到全本，怨声载道。进入８０年代后，删节本、影印本随之获准印制，１９８８年国家特准山东齐鲁书社铅印出版崇祯全本。大陆学者为之欢呼。全本印本尚未出版，不远千里登门或发函求购者已逾两万。
    一部分学者肯定《金瓶梅》是一部伟大的现实主义写实小说，认为其内在价值与艺术成就是不可多得的。有人甚至断言“没有《金瓶梅》，则无《红楼梦》。”另有一部分学者认为该书多揭露人之恶劣行为，使人看了生畏惧心，具有劝善惩恶之教化作用，应肯定之。还有一些人认为《金》是“淫秽之源”，流行于世，弊多利少。
    目前出版《金瓶梅》学术著作也成为大陆出版界的抢手生意。近１０年里各地已出版的有关研究著作不下百种，仅山东齐鲁书社就有１０余种问世。
    据悉，大陆《金瓶梅》知名学者将于下月抵临徐州，与国外约４０位“金学”专家再度探讨《金瓶梅》的奥妙。
