	Bookstores Should Participate in Night Markets

	Currently, many places have opened night markets, offering a wide variety of food and clothing, which are very popular. However, it is rare to see bookstores operating in the evening. Some bookstores have complained in newspapers that people rush to buy goods but not books, urging readers not to forget to buy books. However, bookstores should also consider the convenience of readers and provide more services.

	It is hoped that bookstores, where possible, will implement evening operations. This will benefit both readers and bookstores.

### 书店应上夜市

　　书店应上夜市
    现在很多地方都开办了夜市，吃的、穿的，应有尽有，非常红火，但很少见到书店晚间营业。有的书店曾在报刊上抱怨人们抢购商品而不抢购图书，呼吁读者不要忘了买书。然而，作为书店也应为读者着想，多提供一些方便。
    希望书店在可能的情况下，实行晚间营业，这对读者和书店都有好处。
