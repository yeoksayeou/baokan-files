Recently, reporters in the Northeast region found that, in addition to various levies, "sponsorships," and donations, some large enterprises are now burdened with another item: "delegated meetings." This trend has made enterprises unbearably heavy.

At the Qiqihar Vehicle Factory, last year alone, higher-level party and government agencies and their affiliated institutions held about a dozen meetings at the factory. The subsidies for these "delegated meetings" amounted to 200,000 yuan. So far this year, three meetings have been held here, including the Heilongjiang Provincial Construction System Spiritual Civilization Award Conference, the Heilongjiang Provincial United Front Department Directors' Meeting, and the Heilongjiang Provincial Enterprise Annual Meeting. Currently, discussions are underway for the Fifth Provincial Conference on Ideological and Political Work and the City's Best News Selection Conference.

It is understood that this trend of "delegated meetings" has emerged because some departments, after being required by the state to reduce meeting expenses, have shifted the financial burden to enterprises, making enterprises responsible for providing food, accommodation, and transportation expenses.

Some overwhelmed factory directors have told reporters that they dare not speak out against the higher authorities delegating meetings, fearing to offend the "gods." They appeal to the higher authorities not to "streamline" meetings to enterprises and to quickly curb this trend.

### 别把会“精简”到企业

    别把会“精简”到企业
    记者最近在东北地区采访发现，一些大企业在名目繁多的摊派、“赞助”、捐资之外，如今又添了一项新负担——“下放会议”。这种歪风已使企业不堪重负。
    在齐齐哈尔车辆厂，上级党、政机关及其事业单位去年一年“下放”到厂里开的会议就有十几个，用于“下放会议”的补贴就达20万元。今年以来，全省基建系统精神文明表彰会、全省统战部长会、全省企业报年会等3个会议刚在这里开完，现又有全省第五届思想政治工作年会、全市好新闻评选会等会议正在进行商议。
    据了解，这种“下放会议”的歪风所以出现，主要是因为一些部门在国家要求压缩会议经费后，又把会议经费转嫁到企业头上，由企业提供食宿和交通经费。
    一些不堪重负的厂长向记者反映，上面下放会议，企业敢怒不敢言，唯恐得罪“菩萨”。他们呼吁上级主管部门不要再把会议“精简”到企业来，尽快刹住这股歪风。  新华社记者  新彦、高欣、金虎
