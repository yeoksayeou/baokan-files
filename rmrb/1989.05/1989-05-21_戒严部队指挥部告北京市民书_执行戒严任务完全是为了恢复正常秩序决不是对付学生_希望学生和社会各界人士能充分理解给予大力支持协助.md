Martial Law Command Headquarters Addresses Beijing Citizens

The implementation of martial law tasks is solely for the restoration of normal order and is not directed against students. We hope that students and people from all walks of life can fully understand and provide strong support and assistance.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 21st—The Martial Law Command Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army of China issued a notice to the citizens of Beijing today. The full text is as follows:

On May 20, 1989, at 10:00 AM, the People's Liberation Army, in accordance with the martial law order issued by the State Council and the Beijing Municipal Government, dispatched troops to certain areas of Beijing to assist the city's public security personnel and the People's Armed Police in implementing martial law. To ensure that the martial law troops can fulfill their duties, the following matters are hereby announced to the citizens of the capital:

1. The People's Liberation Army is the people's army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Serving the people wholeheartedly is our army's sole purpose. According to the Constitution, defending the motherland and safeguarding the people's peaceful labor is our army's sacred duty. The troops' implementation of martial law is solely for maintaining the capital's public security and restoring normal order. It is not directed against patriotic students.

2. During the implementation of martial law, the troops encountered some obstruction. The troops, considering the overall situation, adopted the most restrained attitude, and the broad masses of the people also provided cooperation from various aspects. Currently, the order in the capital is still in a state of great chaos, with traffic disrupted, shortages of certain commodities, and the possibility of further deterioration in the public security situation. The people are deeply anxious and worried. The martial law troops must resolutely execute the government's orders. We have the responsibility to take various effective measures to reverse this situation. For the extremely few individuals engaging in acts of violence, looting, arson, and robbery, we will, in accordance with the law and the wishes of the people of the capital, including patriotic students, take decisive measures to deal with them. We hope that the broad patriotic students and people from all walks of life can fully understand and provide strong support and assistance.

3. The broad masses of the people's demands for punishing "official profiteering," opposing corruption, and promoting socialist democracy and legal system construction are firmly supported by the People's Liberation Army. Our implementation of martial law and restoration of the capital's normal order is precisely to create a social environment for realizing these demands. We believe that the Party and the government will represent the people's will and take effective measures to solve various real problems on the track of democracy and the legal system.

4. The troops implementing martial law will strictly abide by all disciplines and, within the troops, carry out education on "loving the capital, loving the people of the capital, loving the young students," and uphold the glorious tradition of the army's support for the government and love for the people. We oppose any words and deeds that harm the fish-water relationship between the military and the people, and with practical actions, safeguard the fundamental interests of the country and the people.

We believe that the citizens of the capital and the young students will, with a high sense of patriotism and social responsibility, consider the overall situation, further adopt rational and restrained attitudes, support the troops in completing the martial law tasks, and restore the capital's normal order as soon as possible.

    执行戒严任务完全是为了恢复正常秩序决不是对付学生
    希望学生和社会各界人士能充分理解给予大力支持协助
    新华社北京５月２１日电  中国人民解放军戒严部队指挥部今天发布告北京市市民书，全文如下：
    １９８９年５月２０日１０时，中国人民解放军遵照国务院戒严令和北京市人民政府令，派部队到北京部分地区协助北京市的公安干警和武警部队执行戒严任务。为使戒严部队能够顺利履行职责，现就有关问题向首都人民通告如下：
    一、中国人民解放军是中国共产党领导下的人民军队，是人民的子弟兵。全心全意为人民服务，是我军的唯一宗旨。根据宪法履行保卫祖国、保卫人民和平劳动的光荣任务，是我军的神圣义务。部队执行戒严任务，完全是为了维护首都治安，恢复正常秩序。决不是对付爱国学生的。
    二、戒严部队在执行任务过程中，受到一些阻拦。部队从大局出发，采取了最大限度的克制态度，广大人民群众也从各方面给予了配合。目前，首都的秩序仍然处于十分混乱的状态，交通中断，某些商品供应短缺，治安形势有可能进一步恶化，人民群众深感不安和忧虑。戒严部队必须坚决执行政府的法令，我们有责任采取各种有效措施扭转这种局面。对于极少数搞打、砸、抢、烧的犯罪分子，我们将根据法律，按照首都人民包括爱国学生的意愿，采取坚决措施予以处置。希望广大爱国学生和社会各界人士能够充分理解，并给予大力支持和协助。
    三、广大人民群众关于惩治“官倒”，反对腐败，推进社会主义民主和法制建设的要求，人民解放军给予坚决的支持。我们执行戒严任务，恢复首都的正常秩序，正是为了创造实现这些要求的社会环境。我们相信党和政府会代表人民的意志，采取有力措施，在民主和法制的轨道上解决各种现实问题。
    四、执行戒严任务的部队，将严格遵守各项纪律，并在部队中开展“热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生”的教育，发扬我军拥政爱民的光荣传统，反对任何有损军民之间鱼水感情的言行，以实际行动维护国家和人民的根本利益。
    我们相信，首都人民和青年学生，一定能够以高度的爱国热情和社会责任感，顾全大局，进一步采取理智和克制的态度，支持部队完成戒严任务，尽快恢复首都的正常秩序。
