Since the beginning of spring, oil prices have been unexpectedly high during the off-season, continuing to rise. Currently, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil in New York is around $20 per barrel. In mid-April, the price of medium-quality West Texas crude oil in the United States reached $22.60 per barrel, and the price of Brent crude oil in the UK was $21.05, the highest since 1986. The trend of oil prices becoming more stable and firm has surprised many oil experts, making the already unpredictable global oil market even more mysterious.

In fact, the oil price situation is so unexpected for a reason.

Due to the strengthening of the global economy and the long-term low oil prices, oil consumption has increased compared to the past. According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, global oil consumption increased by approximately 100 million barrels, or 2%, compared to the same period last year. Among them, oil consumption in the Pacific region increased by 3%, and in European countries by 2.5%. Taking the United States, the world's largest energy-consuming country, as an example, in January of this year, the daily production of crude oil in the United States decreased by 3.4% compared to the same period last year, dropping to 7.9 million barrels, while imports increased by 20.6%, reaching 8.2 million barrels, the first time in nearly a decade that imports exceeded domestic crude oil production.

The OPEC countries have executed the agreement better than expected. In March of this year, OPEC's daily crude oil production was 19.6 million barrels, a decrease of 3.2 million barrels from the original 22.8 million barrels. Even the two countries, Iran and Iraq, which had long been at odds over production quotas, have been relatively compliant with their respective quotas since the beginning of this year. This undoubtedly boosts confidence in the oil market. At the same time, some non-OPEC oil-producing countries have made efforts to support OPEC in stabilizing oil prices, announcing a 5% reduction in daily crude oil exports starting April 1. The Soviet Union also decided for the first time to reduce its crude oil exports to cooperate with OPEC's actions.

In addition, some unexpected events have had a certain impact. Explosions occurred in the oil fields of the North Sea in the UK and Norway, leading to reduced production. Recently, an oil spill accident in Alaska, USA, forced the Valdez oil port to temporarily close, reducing the daily supply of crude oil to the US market. These events have had a pushing effect on oil price increases at specific times.

Rising oil prices are undoubtedly good news for both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries. However, firm prices often tempt some OPEC member countries to disregard production quotas and compete to produce more for profit, introducing instability into the oil market. The recent small decline in oil prices illustrates this point. Preventing this situation is a new test for OPEC's policies.

From the first quarter of this year, although OPEC's oil production has decreased, it is still far above the regulated maximum daily production limit of 18.5 million barrels. It is reported that the United Arab Emirates produces 1.4 million barrels per day, exceeding its quota of 988,000 barrels per day; Kuwait produces 1.35 million barrels of oil per day, also exceeding its quota of 1.037 million barrels per day; other Gulf countries also have overproduction issues. These excess production volumes have been absorbed by the current strong oil market, but with the arrival of summer, oil demand will relatively decrease. If OPEC member countries continue to overproduce, it is possible that oil prices will fall further.

For buyers, the rapid rise in oil prices has affected the profits of refineries. It is said that some European oil companies have slowed down the import of crude oil, turning to import refined products instead.

Within OPEC, there are clear differences among member countries regarding the level at which the current oil prices should be stabilized. Venezuela and Iraq advocate further production cuts to stabilize or continue to raise oil prices. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, on the other hand, prioritize expanding market share over production cuts to maintain prices, aiming to increase production to push oil prices down to $15-18 per barrel. At the end of April, Saudi King Fahd issued a statement supporting OPEC's increase in oil production limits. It is also reported that the ministerial-level meeting scheduled for June 5 will discuss raising the original regulated daily production of 18.5 million barrels by 1-1.5 million barrels.

However, the problem lies in how to allocate the quotas among the 13 member countries if OPEC decides to increase production. If OPEC countries cannot reach a consensus and coordinate production, but instead compete to produce more, it will inevitably trigger a chain reaction within and outside OPEC, causing chaos in the oil market again.

In summary, these are all unstable factors affecting the trend of oil prices, with OPEC's oil price policy playing a decisive role. Therefore, the direction of OPEC's policy at the ministerial-level meeting in Vienna in early June will be closely watched.

### 油价攀升中的隐忧——写在欧佩克部长级会议前夕

    油价攀升中的隐忧
    ——写在欧佩克部长级会议前夕
    顾玉清
    入春以来，石油价格淡季不淡，持续攀升。目前，纽约市场西得克萨斯原油为每桶20美元左右。4月中旬，美国西得克萨斯中质原油每桶售价曾达22.60美元，英国布伦特原油为21.05美元，创1986年以来的最高价格。油价从波动趋于坚挺的走势，出乎许多石油专家的意料，使本来就变幻莫测的世界石油市场更具神秘感。
    事实上，油价形势如此出人意料也是事出有因的。
    由于世界经济活力有所增强以及长期的低油价刺激，石油消费量比过去增加。据统计，今年一季度，世界石油消费量比去年同期增加约100万桶，即增加2％。其中太平洋地区国家增长3％，欧洲国家增长2.5％。以世界上最大的能源消费国美国为例，今年1月份，美国原油日产量比去年同期下降了3.4％，减少到790万桶，而进口量却增加20.6％，高达820万桶，近10年来首次超过国内原油产量。
    欧佩克国家执行协议的情况比预想的要好。今年3月份欧佩克日产原油1960万桶，比原来的2280万桶回落320万桶。就连曾因产量配额问题长期争执不下的两伊，今年以来都较自觉地遵守了各自的配额。这无疑使石油市场信心增强。同时，一些非欧佩克产油国为支持欧佩克稳定油价所作的努力，纷纷宣布从4月1日起将每天原油出口量削减5％。苏联也首次决定减少原油出口，以配合欧佩克的行动。
    此外，一些突发性事件也有一定的影响。英国和挪威北海油田接连发生爆炸事故，造成减产。前不久，美国阿拉斯加州因油轮漏油事故，瓦尔迪兹油港被迫暂时关闭，使每日输往美国市场的原油减少。这些在特定的时间内都对油价上扬起着推波助澜的作用。
    油价攀升，无论对欧佩克还是非欧佩克产油国固然是一件好事。但是，坚挺的价格又往往最能诱使一些欧佩克成员国置分配限额于不顾，竞相私自超产获利，给石油市场带来不稳定的因素。目前油价出现小幅度回落就可说明这一点。能否防止这种局面的出现，正是欧佩克政策面临的新考验。
    从今年一季度看，欧佩克石油产量虽然有所减少，但却远远超过了规定的日产1850万桶最高限额。据透露，阿联酋每天产量高达140万桶，超过了其日产98.8万桶的限额；科威特日产石油达135万桶，也超过了它103.7万桶的限额；其他某些海湾国家也存在超产现象。这些超产部分虽被目前旺盛的石油市场吸收了，但随着夏天的来临，石油需求相对减弱，若欧佩克成员国继续大量超产，导致油价进一步下跌是有可能的。
    就买方而言，由于油价迅速上涨，炼油厂的利润受到了冲击。据说一些欧洲石油公司已放慢了进口原油的速度，转而进口精炼产品。
    在欧佩克内部，对把目前油价稳定在什么样的水平上，各成员国间存在着明显的分歧。委内瑞拉和伊拉克等国主张进一步限产，促使油价稳定或继续上涨。沙特和科威特等国则把扩大市场份额看得比限产保价重要，想以增加产量的手段，将油价下压到每桶15—18美元。4月底沙特国王法赫德发表声明表示支持欧佩克提高石油产量上限。另据报道，拟在6月5日召开的部长级会议上，欧佩克准备讨论将原来规定的1850万桶日产量提高100—150万桶。
    但是问题在于，欧佩克一旦决定提高产量，那么，在13个成员国间如何分摊配额，可能会出现难题。倘若欧佩克国家间不能取得共识，协调生产，而是大开阀门比着干，势必引起欧佩克内外的连锁反应，再次造成石油市场混乱。
    综上所述，可以说都是些影响油价走势的不稳定因素，其中起决定作用的仍是欧佩克的油价政策。因此，在6月初的维也纳部长级会议上，欧佩克的政策动向如何发展将引人关注。
