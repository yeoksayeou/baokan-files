More than 40,000 outstanding nurses competed in an intense two-month contest, and today, 50 of them were awarded the title of "National Nursing Technical Expert" at the award ceremony for the "National Nursing Technical Expert Competition." Tian Wenyan (20 years old) from Beijing Red Cross Chaoyang Hospital, Yan Meifeng (21 years old) from Beijing Xuanwu Hospital, Fan Lifeng (26 years old) from the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, Dai Weijia (31 years old) from the Peace Branch of Shenyang Railway Bureau Central Hospital, and Li Yonghong (24 years old) from Pingliang Regional Hospital in Gansu Province were among the five first-place winners who each received a prize of 2,000 yuan.

Renowned nursing expert and professor from Peking Union Medical College, Yuan Zhanwen, commented on the competition, stating that it will play a significant role in revitalizing China's declining nursing industry. For a long time, the nursing profession in China has not received fair treatment from society, leading to a continuous decline in overall quality. It is understood that China currently has approximately 730,000 nursing personnel, accounting for 19.9% of the 3.6 million medical and technical personnel nationwide. According to standard requirements, the ratio of doctors to nurses should be 1:2. However, our current situation is the exact opposite.

In other news, 100 outstanding "angels in white" from the PLA were honored with the title of "Model Nurses of the PLA" on May 10. This honor was jointly bestowed by the General Political Department and the General Logistics Department of the PLA.

The 100 "Model Nurses of the PLA" are mostly from the front lines of clinical nursing, including veterans with over 30 years of service and new stars who have emerged in recent years. Among them are 4 male nurses.

　　五十护理技术能手得奖  百名全军模范护士获誉
    本报北京５月１０日讯  记者艾笑报道：４万多护理战线的佼佼者，历经两个多月激动人心的角逐后，有５０位在今天的“全国护理技术能手大奖赛”发奖会上获得这项殊荣。来自北京红十字朝阳医院的田文燕（２０岁）、北京宣武医院的阎美凤（２１岁）、解放军总医院的范丽凤（２６岁）、沈阳铁路局中心医院和平分院的戴维佳（３１岁）、甘肃省平凉地区医院的李永红（２４岁）等５位一等奖获得者，还高兴地领到每人２０００元的奖金。
    著名护理专家、北京协和医大教授袁展文等评价这次大奖赛时认为：它对重振我国正在衰落下去的护理事业有推动作用。长期以来，由于护士这一职业在我国得不到社会上公正对待，整体素质每况愈下。据了解，我国现有护理人员约７３万，在全国３６０万医技人员中占１９．９％。按正规要求，医生与护士人数的配比应是１比２。而我们目前的状况正好颠倒。
