The trend of dog ownership is spreading rapidly in Shanghai. "Keeping a dog for companionship" has become a fashionable hobby for some people.

On the streets, stylish women walk their curly-haired dogs with pride; at the alleyways, children play happily with big dogs; in fashion boutiques, shop owners hold small dogs while doing business... Some people even treat their dogs like children or friends, hugging and kissing them, and even sharing meals and living spaces with them.

In China, it is generally prohibited for units and individuals to keep dogs in urban areas. Shanghai has issued the "Dog Management Regulations." However, in recent years, the number of people illegally keeping dogs has been increasing. According to incomplete statistics from public security and other departments, Shanghai currently has about 100,000 dogs in urban and rural areas, with less than half having "permit certificates." Among these, the urban area has about 10,000 dogs, with only 680 having "permit certificates."

With the popularity of dog ownership, illegal "dog markets" have also emerged.

Shanghai has a high population density and housing is cramped. Residents keeping dogs can lead to environmental pollution and neighborhood disputes. Dog-related injuries are not uncommon, with over 2,000 incidents reported in 1988. In January of this year, an elderly woman was bitten by a large yellow dog while walking on Zhoujiawei Road. In February, an 80-year-old man felt something pressing on his shoulder while walking and fainted upon seeing a large wolfdog. A dog kept for 7 years, while accompanying its owner downstairs to see off guests, ran to a nearby elementary school and bit two children.

Dog-related harm has become a significant public nuisance in Shanghai. People fear dogs, but dog owners defend their actions with various excuses. One owner said, "There are no children at home, keeping a dog for company." Another owner said, "Buying a 'Transformers' toy for a child costs dozens of yuan, but buying a dog is both economical and fun." Children also say, "The TV shows 'Carl,' why can't we keep a 'Carl'?"

People are concerned that the trend of dog ownership could lead to the spread of rabies. Dogs that have not received immunization shots, if carrying the rabies virus, can transmit the disease when they bite people. This is more frightening than the spread of hepatitis A. A Shanghai Health Bureau official told the reporter that rabies is a human and animal infectious disease with no effective treatment. Since 1957, Shanghai has not had an outbreak of rabies. However, if the trend of dog ownership continues, it will be difficult to prevent rabies. Medical professionals urge: curb this trend of dog ownership.

### 上海养狗成风  人们担心比甲肝更可怕的狂犬病流行

　　上海养狗成风    
    人们担心比甲肝更可怕的狂犬病流行
    据新华社讯（记者马雪松）养狗风正在上海蔓延。“养条狗白相相”成为一些人的时髦爱好。
    马路上，打扮入时的女郎牵着卷毛狗，走得那么神气；弄堂口，几个孩子同大狗玩得那么开心；时装小店里，老板娘怀抱小狗作生意……更有些人，把狗当成子女或好友，拥抱亲吻，甚至“同吃同住”。
    我国的都市本来是禁止一般单位和个人养狗的。上海市就曾发布过《犬类管理办法》。可是，近年私自养狗的人越来越多。据公安等部门不完全统计，上海市城乡目前约有１０万多条狗，有“准养证”的不到一半。其中市区约有１万条狗，有“准养证”的仅６８０条。
    随着养狗风盛行，非法“狗市”也出现了。
    上海市人口密集，住房拥挤。居民养狗，会造成环境污染、邻里纠纷。养狗伤人的事时有发生，１９８８年竟达２０００多起。今年１月，一老妇途经周家嘴路被一条大黄狗咬伤，２月，一位八旬老人行走时感到忽然有东西压住肩头，回头一看，是一条大狼狗，老人顿时昏倒在地。一条养了７年的狗，随主人下楼送客，竟跑到邻近小学咬伤了两个孩子。
    狗害已成为上海社会一大公害。群众怕狗，但是狗的主人都以种种理由进行辩护。有个主人说：“家里没小孩，养条狗解解闷。”还有个主人说：“给孩子买个‘变形金刚’要几十元，买条狗又省钱又好玩。”小孩子也说：“电视里放《卡尔》，为什么不许我们养‘卡尔’？”
    人们担心，养狗风会带来狂犬病。没有经过免疫注射的狗，如果体内有狂犬病毒，咬人后就会传播。这比“甲肝”流行更可怕。上海卫生局一位干部对记者说，狂犬病是一种人畜共患的急性传染病，至今没有特效的治疗方法。上海市自１９５７年以来，没有流行过狂犬病。但如养狗成风，狂犬病就恐难于杜绝了。医务人员呼吁：煞煞这股养狗风。
