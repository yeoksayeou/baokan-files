The Kailuan Coal Mine, the largest coal production base in China closest to Beijing, has seen its 130,000-plus employees maintain normal attendance and firmly guard their production posts since entering May. The 10 coal mines, which operate in three shifts daily, are continuously carrying out production labor competitions focused on safety, production, increased coal output, and high-quality coal. Building on the 110,000-plus tons of coal overproduced in the first four months, the overall production situation in May 1-22 continued to improve. Especially since May 14, the daily coal production across the entire mine has exceeded the planned target. From May 18-22 alone, the actual production exceeded the planned increase by 175,000 tons.

They are determined to increase production by 70 million tons this year and strive to overproduce by 100 million tons.
