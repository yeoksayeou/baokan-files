The "social issues" reportage literature that emerged after 1985 had already passed its golden age by 1985. The practice of casually introducing all kinds of social issues into reportage literature may not be able to continue. The approach of literary and popularizing existing social science research findings is also questionable. What readers expect is probably the unique discoveries of reportage literature writers themselves. The long reportage literature "Dragon Year: 1988: Horizontal, Vertical, Left, and Right Strokes" published in the third issue of "Reportage Literature" this year may provide some inspiration for reflection on social issues reportage literature.

"Dragon Year" does not follow the old path of social issues reportage literature creation, arranging various materials and statistical data in the work, but creates an atmosphere, allowing people to feel the impact of the Dragon Year on contemporary Chinese people in this atmosphere, thus conveying the various sentiments of the nation during the transition period between old and new societies. The overall tone of the work is solemn. The writer does not rely on disastrous accidents to set the tone for the Dragon Year but, through the experiences of some people living in the Dragon Year, expresses the immense psychological pressure that the Dragon Year has brought to the Chinese people. The development of history often presents many coincidental coincidences. People can understand these coincidences as accidental or as inevitable, of course, this process is inevitably tinged with superstition or has a sense of destiny. The writer seems to use this to strengthen the chaotic situation that appeared in China during the Dragon Year and has conducted a relatively in-depth reflection on the relationship between this chaos and change.

The author of "Dragon Year" is a meticulous person. He writes all the major issues that occurred during the Dragon Year in the form of a chronicle in his work. Careless readers might think he wants to describe each of these chronicles one by one, but the writer does not do so. He delves into the individuals involved in each major event, and through their narratives, continuously conveys the mystery and unpredictability of the Dragon Year to the readers. In the first month of the Dragon Year, the writer first takes the readers into the terrifying year of the Dragon through the 1-18 air crash of the Southwest Airlines Company. Next, the writer narrates the feelings of the elderly professor couple Luo Dagang in the Dragon Year, as well as a story of a conflict between a father and son that eventually turns into a new conflict, to tell people about the psychological changes of the new and old generations during a period of drastic social change. Then, the writer, from the changes in marriage, the changes in farmers, the experiences of individual business owners, the mindset of gamblers, the choices of forest-destroying thugs, the rebellion of the intellectual elite, and the preaching of modern superstition, fully reveals the sentiments of various figures in various social strata during the Dragon Year.

From Longjiang's "Dragon Year," I thought of the reportage literature "Black Speech" by Jia Lusheng (see the first issue of "Reportage Literature" this year). Although these two works have many differences, they have a common point in their creative intentions, that is, both use people's random comments, complaints, legends, superstition stories, black speech, and other trivial matters in daily life to reflect the spiritual state of the entire nation. This kind of reportage literature that takes reflecting national sentiment as its main theme may be a new trend in reportage literature creation. Traditional reportage literature emphasizes character portrayal, while social issues reportage literature, after abandoning characters, focuses on events. Now, some reportage literature writers simply neglect both, arbitrarily choose events that occur in life, and combine these events to reflect people's sentiments and changes in social psychology. This kind of work that highlights the overall state of the nation may be called sentiment reportage literature, thus entering the realm of reportage literature themes.

　　国民心态的记录
    ——读报告文学《龙年》
    谢泳
    １９８５年以后出现的“社会问题”报告文学到１９８５年已经渡过了它的黄金时代。那种轻率地将一切社会问题引入报告文学的做法恐怕未必能再持续下去了。将已有的社会科学研究成果做文学化、通俗化的表现也颇令人怀疑，读者所期望的恐怕还是报告文学作家本人的独特发现。发表在今年第三期《报告文学》上的长篇报告文学《龙年·１９８８·横竖撇捺》，在对社会问题报告文学的反思上可能会给人一些启发。
    《龙年》没有沿袭社会问题报告文学创作的老路，将各种材料和统计数字在作品中排列组合，而是创造一种氛围，让人们在这种氛围中感受到龙年对于当代中国人的影响，从而传达出新旧社会转型期国民的各种心态。整个作品的基调是凝重的，作家没有靠灾难性的事故来烘托龙年的气氛，而是通过一些人物在龙年生活的一种体验来表现龙年对中国人心理上造成的巨大压力。历史的发展常常会出现许多偶然的巧合，对于这种巧合，人们可以理解为一种偶然，也可以理解成一种必然，当然这期中难免渗入迷信的色彩或者具有宿命的味道。作家似乎正是借此来强化整个龙年中国出现的混乱状况，并对这种混乱与变革的关系进行了较为深入的思考。
    《龙年》的作者是一个细心的人，他把整个龙年发生的重大问题都以大事记的形式写在自己的作品中，粗心的读者还以为他要就这些大事记逐一进行描述，但作家却没有那样做，他把笔深入到每一件大事中的当事人身上，在当事人的叙述过程中，不断地将龙年的神秘性和不可知性传达给读者。作家在龙年的第一个月中，首先通过西南航空公司的一·一八空难事故，将读者带入了龙年这个令人充满恐怖的年度中。接下来，作家叙述了“从一而衷”的老教授罗大冈夫妇在龙年的感受，以及一个父辈曾经发生冲突，而冲突最后转化成新的冲突的故事，借此来告诉人们在社会发生剧烈变革时期新老两代人的心理变化。接下来，作家从婚姻的变化、农民的变化、个体户的经历、赌博者的心态、砍伐森林暴徒的选择，知识分子精英阶层的叛逆以及现代迷信者的布道等几个侧面充分揭示了龙年中社会各个阶层中各种人物的心态。
    由长江的《龙年》我想到了前不久读到的贾鲁生的报告文学《黑话》（见今年第１期《报告文学》）。这两篇作品尽管有很多不同，但在创作意图上却有相通的一点，即都在通过对人们随意发出的议论、牢骚、传说、迷信故事、黑话等日常生活中的小事来反映整个国民的精神状态。这种以反映国民心态为主旨的报告文学可能是报告文学创作中的新动向。传统的报告文学强调刻画人物，而社会问题报告文学在抛弃了人物之后看重事件，现在有些报告文学作家索性将二者都偏废了，随意选择生活中发生的事件，并将这些事件组合起来反映人们的心态和社会心理的变化。这种突出整个国民状态的作品或许称为心态报告文学，从而加入报告文学的题材领域。
