The Beijing Buddhist Music Troupe, at the invitation of the Singapore Buddhist Society, will depart for Singapore today to perform Zhihua Temple's traditional music.

Zhihua Temple's traditional music has a history of over 500 years. The surviving melodies such as "Zhongtang Qu" and "Liaojiao" are derived from Tang Dynasty lyric tunes and Yuan Dynasty northern and southern opera tunes. The performance style is influenced by Buddhism, characterized by a "quiet, distant, empty, and subtle" quality. The sheng is the main instrument, while the dizi and sheng can add ornamental notes, and the yunluo adds rhythmic embellishments. Each instrument complements the others while showcasing its unique strengths.

During this visit, the 26th and 27th generation inheritors of Zhihua Temple's music, including monks Zengyuan, Qinghai, Benxing, Mingsheng, and Fuguo, will demonstrate their skills, allowing audiences in a foreign land to appreciate the elegant and refined essence of Chinese Buddhist ancient music.

　　北京佛教音乐团访问新加坡
    本报北京５月１２日讯  应新加坡居士林邀请，北京佛教音乐团今天赴星岛献艺，演出智化寺京音乐。
    智化寺京音乐有５００多年的传统，目前流传下来的曲牌《中堂曲》、《料峭》等，源于唐代词牌和元代南北曲曲牌，在演奏风格上受佛教影响，具有“静、远、虚、淡”的特殊气质。管子是主奏器，笛子和笙可以加花指，云锣在节奏上加花点，各种乐器相互照应又各显其长。
    该团此次访新期间，智化寺第２６代和第２７代音乐传人增远、清海、本兴、明声、福广等艺僧将展绝技，让异国听众领略中国佛教古乐的淡雅高风。
