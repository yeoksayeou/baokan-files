Despite the martial law in the city, Beijing's art enthusiasts did not want to miss this excellent performance. Last night and tonight, the Red Torch Theater from the Soviet Union performed the play "The Crimson Island" at the Capital Theater. The venue was packed, and the atmosphere was lively. The applause lasted for several minutes after the show ended. After the performance, people, carrying the afterglow of art, rode bicycles or took night buses home safely.

Bulgakov's play "The Crimson Island" was banned in the Soviet Union for over half a century and was only recently allowed to be performed during the reforms. The play tells the story of a theater in the Soviet Union planning to stage a new play about native people's rebellion. However, the theater manager does not have the authority to decide, and the person with real power has to approve it. That person, however, is going on vacation. After many twists and turns, the play was not banned but had to be modified according to that person's instructions. The story on stage is about a foreign country, but the Chinese audience seemed familiar with it. Despite simultaneous interpretation, the shared thoughts and artistic resonance evoked laughter and applause. The Soviet actors' deep skills and exquisite performances also captivated the Chinese audience. Russian theater emphasizes serious themes, with diverse performance techniques, and is particularly known for its Gogol-style satirical comedies. This tradition is inherited and given a modern touch in this play.

As pioneers of the Soviet drama industry visiting China, the New Siberian Red Torch Theater is known as the "Far Eastern Moscow Gorky Drama Theater" and has many Soviet People's Artists. They will also perform "The House of the Nobleman" in Beijing. The theater's visit to China was at the invitation of the Central Experimental Drama Theater, marking a new step in the theater's reform.

　　苏联话剧团首次访华
    演出讽刺文化禁令的戏大受欢迎
    《火红的孤岛》引起中国观众共鸣
    本报５月２８日讯  记者袁晞报道：尽管城市戒严，北京的文艺爱好者仍不愿错过上乘的演出，昨晚和今晚苏联红色火炬剧院在首都剧场演出话剧《火红的孤岛》，场内座无虚席，气氛热烈，剧终掌声长达数分钟。散场后人们带着艺术的余韵，骑自行车或乘夜班电汽车平安地回家。
    布尔加科夫的剧作《火红的孤岛》在苏联禁演半个多世纪，近年在改革中开禁。剧中写苏联某剧院拟上演一出土著人造反的新戏，可剧院经理却无权决定，只能由那个掌实权的人拍板，而那个人又要去休假。几经周折，戏终未被禁，但不得不遵照那个人的旨意修改了结尾。台上是异国的故事，台下的中国观众似曾相识，尽管是同声传译，思想和艺术的共鸣引起阵阵笑声和掌声。苏联演员深厚的功力和精湛的表演也让中国观众倾倒。俄罗斯戏剧注重严肃主题，表现手法多样，尤以果戈里式的讽刺喜剧见长的传统在这出戏中得到承继并赋予了现代意味。
    作为苏联话剧界访华的先行者，新西伯利亚红色火炬剧院有“远东的莫斯科高尔基话剧院”的美称，有众多苏联人民演员。他们还将在京上演《贵族之家》。剧院此次来华是应中央实验话剧院之邀，这种民间的艺术交流是中央实验话剧院体制改革的新步骤。
