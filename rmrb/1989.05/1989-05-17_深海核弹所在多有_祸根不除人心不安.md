Twenty-four years ago, news emerged that the U.S. Navy had lost a hydrogen bomb off the coast of Japan. This revelation, recently published in the media, has drawn global attention. According to the Greenpeace organization, the hydrogen bomb had a yield of one hundred megatons of TNT and fell from an A-4 fighter jet into the ocean, plunging to a depth of 3,600 meters from an aircraft carrier.

Currently, at least 48 nuclear bombs and 11 nuclear reactors are scattered on the ocean floor worldwide, with most of them being of Soviet origin. On April 7 of this year, a Soviet submarine sank off the coast of Norway, carrying two nuclear reactors. On October 6, 1986, a Soviet Yankee-class submarine sank off the coast of Bermuda, carrying 16 ballistic missiles, each equipped with two warheads, and powered by nuclear reactors.

U.S. military officials have explained that nuclear warheads must undergo a series of complex processes before they can be armed and detonated, thus posing no immediate danger of explosion. Even so, the fact that humanity lives under the shadow of accumulated nuclear weapons has caused widespread and profound concern.

　　深海核弹所在多有  祸根不除人心不安
    二十四年前美国海军在日本沿海遗失一枚氢弹的消息最近披露于报端，引起了世界公众的关注。据绿色和平组织揭露，这枚氢弹当量为一百万吨ＴＮＴ，是随一架Ａ４战斗机一起从航空母舰上跌入三千六百米深的海底。
    目前，全世界海底起码散落有四十八枚核弹和十一个核反应装置，其中多数为苏联所遗。今年四月七日，一苏联潜艇沉没于挪威沿海，上有两个核反应装置。一九八六年十月六日，一苏联杨基级潜艇沉于百慕大沿海，上有十六枚弹道导弹，每个导弹上又各有二枚弹头，动力也是核反应装置。
    美国军方人士解释说，核弹头必须经一系列的复杂过程才能装上引信爆炸，故海底核弹均无爆炸危险。即使如此，人类生活于核弹堆积之上的状况仍引起普遍而深切的担忧。
