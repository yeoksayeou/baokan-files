Young friends, students, comrades!

The 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement is a great day for Chinese youth and a great day for the entire Chinese nation. As the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China is approaching, and as the 10th anniversary of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which opened a new era of socialist modernization and comprehensive reform in our country, is also approaching, at a time when the people of the entire nation, especially the youth, need to unite more closely, work together, overcome difficulties, maintain social stability, and promote construction and reform, we gather here to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and further carry forward the spirit of May Fourth. This has great significance.

The May Fourth Movement was first and foremost a great patriotic movement against imperialism and feudalism. The most universal and profound reason that attracted a large number of young people and people from all walks of life to participate in this movement was their deep concern for the fate of the nation and their ardent longing for a truly independent, free, prosperous, and strong new China. The May Fourth Movement was also a great new cultural movement, a great movement of enlightenment and liberation of thought. Under the banner of democracy and science, the young people of that time began to look at themselves, China, and the world with new eyes. A part of the most awakened young intellectuals, through the exploration and comparison of various social and political doctrines and salvation plans, through the observation and contemplation of world trends, finally chose the truth of Marxism. In 1921, the Communist Party of China was established. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people and youth of China waged a long, arduous, and unyielding struggle of new democratic revolution. The process of this people's revolution was a process of integrating Marxism with Chinese revolutionary practice, and it was also a process of continuously carrying forward the patriotic, democratic, and scientific spirit of May Fourth.

The victory of the people's revolution opened a new chapter in Chinese history. From the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution, in a hundred years, our central task was to destroy—destroy the old system that obstructed China's progress. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the central task shifted to construction—building a socialist new China. From destruction to construction, this is an extremely profound transformation of the historical mission of the Chinese people. We did not fully and effectively realize this transformation in the past. The ten-year turmoil of the Cultural Revolution was a complete deviation from the historical requirements. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the Party and the people of the whole country have summed up the historical experience and lessons, and embarked on the correct path of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, firmly shifting the focus of work to socialist modernization construction, and proposing the tasks of reforming the economic and political systems. In this way, we have entered a new era of socialist modernization construction and comprehensive reform.

When we commemorate the May Fourth Movement today, we should adapt to the requirements of the new era, that is, the requirements of construction, inherit and carry forward the patriotic, democratic, and scientific spirit of May Fourth, give them new content, and reach new heights.

When we talk about patriotism today, it means to build China well, achieve the Four Modernizations, and revitalize China. It means to take the development of productive forces as the center and pillar, through reforms in various aspects such as the economic system, political system, scientific and educational system, and so on, to prosper the socialist planned commodity economy, build socialist democratic politics, and develop scientific culture—that is, socialist spiritual civilization guided by Marxism. We say that with the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people have stood up, which means that politically, they are no longer subject to the domination of imperialism and the rule of the reactionary classes, and the people themselves are masters of the country. Now we still have to say that the task of the Chinese people standing up is not yet completed. Only after several generations of hard struggle and the realization of the goal of socialist modernization, can China truly stand up in terms of economy, culture, science and technology, and social development, and in the comprehensive national strength competition in the world. Only in this struggle process, can the superiority of socialism be gradually and fully demonstrated on Chinese soil. We must carry forward the spirit of patriotism, make it a powerful cohesive force, inspire the self-sacrificing spirit of hundreds of millions of young people, and inspire the self-sacrificing spirit of workers, peasants, technicians, teachers, students, reporters, doctors, scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, state officials, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army from all walks of life, and strive to build a powerful, democratic, and civilized great socialist modernized country.

When we talk about democracy and science today, we must also closely revolve around and serve the goal of construction. The great cause of socialist modernization in our country is necessarily a great cause of transforming the whole society and improving the quality of the whole nation. We want to change the backward state. We want to get rid of poverty. We want to overcome ignorance. We want to gradually eliminate all kinds of undemocratic and unscientific thoughts and habits in social life and people's consciousness, step by step. We want to promote democratic spirit and build democratic institutions in all aspects of social life and all work of reform and construction in a country with a population of 1.1 billion, and promote scientific spirit, and handle everything according to the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts, and gradually promote the great development of the cause of education and science. Without democracy, without science, there is no socialism, and there is no socialist modernization. In the process of socialist modernization construction and comprehensive reform, learning democracy, promoting democracy, learning science, and respecting science are extremely important tasks facing the Communist Party of China, and are also extremely important tasks facing the people and youth of the whole country.

Comrades! Our magnificent and arduous tasks of modernization construction and reform can only be carried out smoothly in a stable rather than a turbulent social and political environment. In the ten years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the correct policies and guidelines of the Party have been able to be implemented, and reform and construction have been able to achieve the results that everyone has personally felt, the most important reason is that social stability has been maintained. This is the result of the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. Workers, peasants, intellectuals, young students, ethnic minorities, parties, and people from all walks of life across the country have all contributed to stability and have all benefited from stability. It is not easy to form a consensus on this issue that concerns the overall situation and work together! Sometimes we do not feel the preciousness of stability when we are in stability, but if we lose stability, we will regret it deeply! What we want to do will not be done at all; even the achievements we have already made will be destroyed in an instant. If stability is destroyed, what will we get? Will we get the progress of democracy and science? Will we get the fruits of reform and construction? Will we get the revitalization of the motherland? None of these! Only turmoil will be obtained. Have we not had enough days of turmoil? From 1840 to this year, 150 years, we have only struggled for about 20 years of peace. The remaining more than 120 years, 110 years were messed up by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and more than 10 years were messed up by Lin Biao, the "Gang of Four," and our own subjective mistakes, causing people to be in a state of panic. What we all feel happy about now is that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we have indeed had 10 good years. If turmoil occurs again, if large-scale social conflicts and anarchy occur, causing people to be in a state of panic, causing social order, production order, study order, and work order to be in chaos, causing people to be in chaos, causing the country to be in a state of no peace, a China with great hope and prospects will become a China with no prospects and in a state of turmoil. If such a situation occurs, the construction, reform, democracy, and science that the people of the whole country, including the broad masses of young students, hope for, will all be out of the question. Not only that, but those anti-democratic and anti-scientific things, ignorant and even barbaric things, will spread and prevail. The whole Party, the people of the whole country, and the youth of the whole country must clearly oppose turmoil and resolutely safeguard the hard-won stable and united political situation. Stability is not about not wanting democracy, but about making our democracy take an orderly and legalized path. While we are building a new order of socialist commodity economy, we must also build a new order of socialist democratic politics. This is a new order of democratic politics established on the basis of the Four Cardinal Principles, which is undoubtedly necessary for modernization construction and reform, and is also necessary for maintaining the stability of the social and political environment. Stability, gradual progress, rationality, order, and legal system are the requirements of construction and reform, and are also the requirements of democracy and science. If we think and work according to such requirements, our cause will be successful.

Our magnificent and arduous tasks of modernization construction and reform can only be steadily advanced under the correct and strong leadership of the Communist Party of China. Our Party is a Party that adheres to and creatively develops Marxism, a Party that adheres to reform and opening up, a Party that respects knowledge and talent, a Party that relies on the people and the youth. In the 68 years since its founding, our Party has made great historical contributions to the Chinese people while also making various mistakes. However, history has proven and will continue to prove that our Party is a Party full of self-criticism and vitality. The broad masses, including the broad masses of students, hope to promote democratic politics, punish corruption and bribery, develop education and science, and this is also the advocacy of our Party. The heart of the Communist Party of China is connected with the hearts of the people and the youth. Let us all communicate with each other, understand each other, and do a better job in the atmosphere of stability, unity, and pulling together in the same boat! We must, while transforming the objective world, also transform our subjective world. In the process of construction and reform, our society and our entire nation are undergoing profound transformations. Our Party is also undergoing profound transformations, and the purpose of this transformation is, of course, not to change the nature and inherent advantages of our Party, but to enable our Party to better shoulder the heavy responsibility of leading the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, construction, reform, democracy, and science in China will become illusions. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, there would be no victory of the Chinese revolution, no socialist China of today, no socialist modernization of China, and no future and hope for China. To talk about the law of development of Chinese history since May Fourth, this is the most important law. Understanding and respecting this law, our cause will be successful.

Comrades! The pioneers of the May Fourth Movement repeatedly expressed such a belief: the creation of a young China relies on the awakening of the youth. Their trust and expectations for the youth, their far-sighted vision and optimism, are equally important when we observe Chinese youth and the fate of China today. On the occasion of commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, the Party and the people place their hopes on the youth. Comrade Deng Xiaoping attaches great importance to and cares for the youth, and has high expectations for the important role of contemporary youth in reform and construction, saying: "The growth of the younger generation is precisely where our cause will definitely prosper and develop." In the 10 years since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, modernization construction and reform have been the main melody of the times, always calling on the younger generation to follow the Party in the great cause of history.

Youth should establish a pioneering and enterprising spirit in construction. Without exploration, there is no creation, and without creation, construction and reform cannot be promoted. Young people want to give full play to their potential and realize their self-worth, and this enthusiasm should be protected, so that young people can sail in the vast ocean of modernization, temper themselves, and improve themselves. Young people love to think and are brave in seeking various new knowledge, and this is precisely their precious quality. Without thinking, how can we move forward? Without various new knowledge, we cannot enrich ourselves and make comparisons. In the process of thinking, it is inevitable to have biases and confusion. However, as long as there is a spirit of patriotism, linking one's own responsibility with the fate of the country, as long as there is a spirit of democracy, linking one's own role with the strength of the collective, as long as there is a spirit of science, linking beautiful ideals with realistic conditions, then one will definitely be able to overcome one's own weaknesses and shortcomings through one's own thinking and exploration, experience the true interests and demands of the people, experience the call and trend of the times, experience the historical connection between one's own efforts and the efforts of the predecessors, and experience one's own lofty mission for the future of the country. In this way, young people will definitely be able to understand more deeply the historical necessity of adhering to the socialist road, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and understand more deeply the historical necessity of adhering to the general policy and general line of reform and opening up, and recognize one's own path from the overall situation of the country.

Youth should establish a down-to-earth and hardworking spirit in construction. To build such a populous and economically and culturally backward country into a modernized socialist country is a long-term, extremely arduous, and complex great cause, which requires the persistent efforts of the entire nation for several generations. History has destined that your generation of youth can only be a generation that works hard and toils for the socialist modernization of China. There is no shortcut to reform and construction, and every step forward cannot be separated from the labor and struggle of the people, especially the youth. We need persistent, down-to-earth, long-term struggle. Recognize the historical mission, be sober, rational, resolute, calm, seek truth from facts, and work hard. These are the most precious and most needed qualities of contemporary Chinese youth.

The Communist Youth League, as the mass organization of advanced youth in our country, has played an irreplaceable and great role in the development of the youth movement in the past 70 years and in the practice of comprehensively opening up a new situation in youth work in the 10 years of reform and opening up. In the new historical period, our Party should pay more attention to, care for, and support the work of the Communist Youth League. The Communist Youth League should also live up to the Party's expectations, unite with the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation and other youth organizations, maintain close, lively, and lively contact with the broad masses of youth, better play the role of the Party's assistant and reserve force, the bridge and bond between the Party and government and the youth, the social representative of youth interests and demands, and truly build the Communist Youth League into a great school for guiding youth to learn communism in practice.

From now on, in 11 more years, we will enter the 21st century. The future belongs to the youth. The youth of the turn of the century shoulder a glorious and arduous mission. The Party places its hopes on you, and the people place their hopes on you! Young people of the whole country, fellow countrymen, let us unite as one, work hard, overcome all difficulties, and strive together for the revitalization of China!

　　在建设和改革的新时代进一步发扬五四精神    
    ——在首都青年纪念五四运动七十周年大会上的讲话
    赵紫阳
    （一九八九年五月三日）
    青年朋友们，同学们，同志们！
    五四运动７０周年，是中国青年的伟大节日，也是整个中华民族的伟大节日。在中华人民共和国建立４０周年快要到来的今天，在中国共产党十一届三中全会开辟我国社会主义现代化建设和全面改革新时代已达１０年的今天，在全国人民、全国青年需要更加紧密地团结起来，同心同德，克服困难，维护社会安定，推进建设和改革的今天，我们来纪念五四运动７０周年，进一步发扬五四精神，具有重大的意义。
    五四运动首先是一次伟大的反帝反封建的爱国运动。吸引广大青年和各界人民投入这次运动的最普遍最深刻的原因，是他们对国家危亡和民族命运的强烈关切，对建立一个真正独立、自由、繁荣、富强的新中国的热情向往。五四运动又是一次伟大的新文化运动，伟大的思想启蒙和思想解放运动。在民主和科学的旗帜下，那时的广大青年开始用新的眼光看自己，看中国，看世界。一部分最有觉悟的青年知识分子，通过对各种社会政治学说和救亡方案的探索和比较，通过对世界潮流的观察和思考，终于选择了马克思主义的真理。在１９２１年，建立了中国共产党。中国人民和中国青年在中国共产党领导下，进行了长时期的艰苦卓绝的新民主主义革命斗争。这个人民大革命的进程，是马克思主义与中国革命实践相结合的进程，也是五四的爱国、民主和科学精神不断发扬的进程。
    人民革命的胜利，揭开了中国历史的新篇章。从旧民主主义革命到新民主主义革命，１００年的时间，我们的中心任务是破坏——破坏阻碍中国前进的旧制度。中华人民共和国建立以后，中心的任务转到了建设——建设社会主义的新中国。从破坏到建设，这是中国人民历史使命的极其深刻的转变。我们过去没有能够充分自觉地有效地实现这个转变，“文化大革命”十年动乱，更是一场完全违背历史要求的大破坏。十一届三中全会以来，总结了历史的经验教训，全党全国人民走上了建设有中国特色的社会主义的正确道路，坚定不移地把工作重心转到社会主义现代化建设上来，并且围绕建设，提出了经济体制和政治体制改革的任务。这样，我们进入了一个社会主义现代化建设和全面改革的新时代。
    我们现在纪念五四运动，就应当适应新时代的要求即建设的要求，继承和发扬五四的爱国、民主和科学精神，使它们具有新的内容，达到新的高度。
    我们今天讲爱国，就是要把中国建设好，实现四化，振兴中华。就是要以发展生产力为中心和支柱，通过经济体制、政治体制、科学教育体制等各方面的改革，繁荣社会主义的有计划的商品经济，建设社会主义民主政治，发展科学的文化——即以马克思主义为指导的社会主义精神文明。我们说，由于中华人民共和国的建立，中国人民站起来了，这是指在政治上不再受帝国主义的支配和反动阶级的统治，人民自己当家作主了。现在我们还要说，中国人民站起来这个任务并没有最后完成。只有经过几代人的艰苦奋斗，实现了社会主义现代化的目标，中国才能在经济、文化、科学技术和社会发展上，在综合国力的世界较量中，完全站起来。也只有在这样的奋斗过程中，社会主义优越性才能在中国大地上逐步地充分显示出来。我们一定要发扬爱国主义精神，使它形成强大的凝聚力，鼓舞起亿万青年的献身精神，鼓舞起广大工人、农民、技术人员、教师、学生、记者、医生、科学家、文艺家、企业家、国家公务人员和人民解放军官兵等各行各业劳动者的献身精神，为建设一个富强的、民主的、文明的伟大社会主义现代化国家而奋斗。
    我们今天讲民主和科学，也同样要紧紧围绕并服务于建设的目标。我国社会主义现代化建设的伟大工程，必然是整个社会改造和整个民族素质提高的伟大工程。我们要改变落后状态。要摆脱贫穷。要克服愚昧。要把社会生活和人民意识中种种不民主不科学的思想和习惯，一步一步地加以消除。要在十一亿人口的大国里，在社会生活的各个方面和改革建设的一切工作中，发扬民主精神，建设民主制度，发扬科学精神，按照一切从实际出发的科学态度办事，并使教育事业和科学事业逐步地得到极大的发展。没有民主，没有科学，就没有社会主义，就没有社会主义现代化。在社会主义现代化建设和全面改革的进程中，学习民主，发扬民主，学习科学，尊重科学，是摆在我们中国共产党面前的极其重要的任务，也是摆在全国人民和全国青年面前的极其重要的任务。
    同志们！我们宏伟艰巨的现代化建设和改革的任务，只有在稳定的而不是动乱的社会政治环境中，才能顺利地进行。十一届三中全会以来的十年，党的正确方针政策之所以能够贯彻实施，改革和建设之所以能够取得大家都切身感受到的成效，最重要的一条是保持了社会的稳定。这是全国人民共同努力维护的结果。全国的工人，农民，知识分子，青年学生，各民族，各党派，各界人士，都为稳定出了力，也都从稳定受了益。在稳定这个事关全局的问题上形成共识，同心协力，不容易呵！身在稳定之中，有时不大觉得稳定之可贵，但是，如果一旦失去稳定，就会痛悔莫及！我们渴望办成的事，就一件也办不成；连已经取得的成就，也会毁于一旦。如果把稳定破坏了，能得到什么呢？能得到民主和科学的进步吗？能得到改革和建设的果实吗？能得到祖国的振兴吗？都不能！只能得到动乱。动乱的日子难道我们过得还少吗？从１８４０年到今年１５０年间，我们只争取到２０几年安稳日子。其余１２０多年，１１０年被帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义搞得乱七八糟，还有１０多年被林彪、“四人帮”和我们自己的主观指导失误闹得人心惶惶。如今大家共同感到欣慰的是，十一届三中全会以来我们确确实实过了１０年好日子。如果再发生动乱，发生大规模的社会冲突和无政府状态，乱了人心，乱了社会秩序、生产秩序、学习秩序、工作秩序，乱了人民自己，闹得国无宁日，一个很有希望很有前途的中国，就会变为一个动乱不安的没有前途的中国。如果出现那种局面，全国人民包括广大青年学生希望的建设、改革、民主、科学，就一概都谈不上。不仅如此，那些反民主反科学的东西，愚昧甚至野蛮的东西，就会泛滥和横行。全党、全国人民、全国青年都要旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，坚决维护得来不易的安定团结的政治局面。稳定不是不要民主，而是要使我们的民主走上一条有秩序的法制化的正道。我们在建设社会主义商品经济新秩序的同时，也要建设社会主义民主政治的新秩序。这是一种建立在四项基本原则基础上的民主政治新秩序，无疑是现代化建设和改革所必需的，也是维护社会政治环境的稳定所必需的。稳定，渐进，理智，秩序，法制，这是建设和改革的要求，也是民主和科学的要求。按照这样的要求去想问题，做工作，我们的事业就能取得胜利。
    我们宏伟艰巨的现代化建设和改革的任务，只有在中国共产党的正确和坚强的领导下，才能扎扎实实地推进。我们的党，是坚持并且创造性地发展马克思主义的党，是坚持改革、坚持开放的党，是尊重知识、尊重人才的党，是依靠人民、依靠青年的党。６８年来，我们党在为中国人民作出历史性的伟大贡献的同时，也犯过大大小小各种错误。但是，历史已经证明并将继续证明，我们党是富有自我批评精神的生机蓬勃的党。广大群众包括广大学生希望推进民主政治，要求惩处贪污腐败，发展教育和科学，这也正是我们党的主张。中国共产党之心，是同人民之心、青年之心连在一起的。让我们大家互相沟通，互相理解，在安定团结、同舟共济的气氛中把今后的工作做得更好吧！我们必须在改造客观世界的同时改造自己的主观世界。在建设和改革的进程中，我们的社会，我们整个民族，正在经历深刻的改造。我们党也正在经历深刻的改造，这种改造的目的，当然不是要改掉我们党的性质和固有的优势，而是要使我们党能够更好地担负起领导建设有中国特色的社会主义现代化的重任。中国的建设、改革、民主、科学，离开中国共产党的领导，就会成为泡影。没有中国共产党的领导，就没有中国革命的胜利，就没有中国社会主义的今天，就没有中国的社会主义现代化，也就没有中国的前途和希望。要讲五四以来中国历史发展的规律，这就是最重要的一条规律。懂得并且尊重这条规律，我们的事业就能胜利。
    同志们！当年五四运动的先驱者们，反复地表达了这样的信念：青春中华之创造，全靠青年之觉醒。他们对于青年的信任与期望，他们的这种远大眼光和乐观主义，在我们今天观察中国青年和中国命运的时候，同样是极其重要的。在纪念五四运动７０周年的时候，回顾过去，展望未来，党和人民把希望寄托在青年身上。邓小平同志十分关心和爱护青年一代，对当代青年在改革和建设中的重大作用寄予殷切的厚望，他说：“青年一代的成长，正是我们事业必定要兴旺发达的希望所在。”党的十一届三中全会以来的１０年中，现代化建设和改革作为时代的主旋律，始终召唤着青年一代跟随党在伟大的历史事业中前进。
    青年要在建设中树立开拓进取的探索精神。没有探索就没有创造，没有创造就不能推进建设和改革。青年人要求发挥自己的潜能，实现自我的价值，这种积极性应当受到保护，使青年能够在现代化事业的大海洋中乘风破浪，锻炼自己，提高自己。青年人爱思索，勇于探寻各种新知，这正是他们的可贵之处。没有思索，怎么能够前进呢？没有各种新知，就不能丰富自己，并进行比较。在思索过程中，难免有偏颇和迷惘。但是，只要有爱国精神，把自己的责任同国家的命运联系起来，只要有民主精神，把个人的作用同集体的力量联系起来，只要有科学精神，把美好的理想同现实的条件联系起来，那就一定能够通过自己的思考和探索，克服自己的弱点和不足，体验到人民的真正利益和要求，体验到时代的呼唤和潮流，体验到自己的努力同前辈努力的历史联系，体验到自己对国家未来负有的崇高使命。这样，青年就一定能够越来越深刻地理解坚持社会主义道路、坚持人民民主专政、坚持中国共产党的领导、坚持马列主义毛泽东思想的历史必然性，越来越深刻地理解坚持改革开放总方针总政策的历史必然性，从整个国家的前途中认清自己的道路。
    青年要在建设中树立脚踏实地的艰苦奋斗精神。把我们这样一个人口众多、经济文化落后的大国建设成为现代化的社会主义国家，是长期的、极为艰难复杂的伟大事业，需要我们全民族几代人进行持久的努力。历史注定了你们这一代青年，只能是为中国的社会主义现代化艰苦创业、埋头苦干的一代。改革和建设没有捷径可走，每前进一步，都离不开人民尤其是青年的劳动和奋斗。我们需要的是坚韧不拔、扎扎实实的长期奋斗。认清历史的使命，清醒，理智，坚毅，沉着，实事求是，艰苦奋斗，这是当代中国青年最可贵最需要的品质。
    共青团作为我国先进青年的群众组织，在近７０年青年运动的发展过程中，在改革开放十年全面开创青年工作新局面的实践中，发挥了不可替代的巨大作用。在新的历史时期，我们党要更加重视、关心和支持共青团的工作，共青团也要不辜负党的希望，联合青联和学联等青年团体，同最广大的青年群众保持密切的、生动活泼的联系，更好地发挥党的助手和后备军的作用，党和政府同青年群众之间的桥梁和纽带作用，青年利益和要求的社会代表作用，把共青团真正建设成为引导青年在实践中学习共产主义的大学校。
    从现在起，再过１１年，我们就要跨入２１世纪了。未来是属于青年的。处于世纪之交的青年一代肩负着光荣而艰巨的使命。党寄希望于你们，人民寄希望于你们！全国青年们，全国同胞们，让我们同心同德，艰苦奋斗，排除万难，为中华的振兴而共同奋斗！
