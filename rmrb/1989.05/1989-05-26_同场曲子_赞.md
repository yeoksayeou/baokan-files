	Praise for "Same Stage Songs"
	Xú Chéngběi

	In Kunqu opera, there is often a type of "same stage song" where the main actor and the extras sing together. When singing, they not only use the same amount of breath, but also exchange with each other, truly forming a "unified ensemble" on stage. Beijing opera rarely has such a situation, even when performing "Kunqu-style" pieces. When has one seen a general singing "Dian Jiangun" on stage, with the soldiers also singing in unison? On the contrary, it is often seen that the general cannot hit the high notes and "cuts corners."

	In the autumn of 1986, Yu Zhenfei led the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Troupe to visit Beijing. That time, many talented performers came, and Shanghai Kunqu's "seven pillars and ten beams" almost all came. With so many "stars" in the advertisements, it naturally increased the appeal; however, it inevitably created conflicts in the specific order and importance of the performances. I am friends with some of these "pillars and beams," and I heard some grumbling behind the scenes. If this were in the Beijing opera world, someone would have already left the stage in protest. Regarding this, Yu Zhenfei once told me: "This is a bad habit you learned from Beijing opera! In the past, our Kunqu performances had actors taking turns as the main role, and the order of the performances didn't matter. Many performances had 'same stage songs,' where supporting actors (who were main actors in other performances) and main actors (who were supporting actors in other performances) sang together, resulting in mutual understanding and harmony. The quality of the performance and the unity of the actors both improved. Now, these 'pillars and beams' almost never come. It's hard to say who was the first 'pillar or beam' who refused to be an extra, but when it was their turn to be the main actor, no one came to support them. Now, when you hear 'same stage songs' in the performances, they are loose and lackluster, far from the atmosphere of the past. It's all because of your Beijing opera 'stars'..."

	Hearing the tone of "your Beijing opera, your Beijing opera," it really feels a bit funny. However, after a few years of reflection, the logic in the old man's words has become increasingly clear. Currently, the "stars" and "non-stars" in Beijing opera are not just having trouble singing together; it has developed to the point where they often refuse to perform on the same stage. After implementing contracting or optimizing combinations, "stars" no longer want to lead a large troupe of seventy or eighty people, "The burden is too heavy, and it's hard to move forward!" At the same time, they found that taking a few to seven or eight people on tour to make money is convenient, light, and profitable. It's not scary to do it once or twice, but it's scary to do it over a long period. The "non-stars" see this—"Hey! They don't value us! Alright, you wait and see!" The opportunity finally comes. When the "star" makes enough money to reach the "middleweight" level, they suddenly realize that if they don't perform regularly, the audience will forget about them. Thus, they urgently ask the manager to notify all the "non-stars"—on such and such a day, at such and such a place, we will start rehearsing. However, the response is: "Please find someone else, we won't serve you anymore..."

	It's still better to have "same stage songs," even if we can't directly copy the old forms. I just hope that the "stars" and "non-stars" can sit down and talk, and even more, I hope that merchants and non-merchants, officials and non-officials can all gather together, calmly discuss, and think of some solutions.

　　“同场曲子”赞
    徐城北
    昆剧中常有一种“同场曲子”，由主要演员与龙套同声歌唱，歌唱时不仅一样地用气力，而且相互间有交流，全台真正形成“一棵菜”。京剧极少有这种情形，即使是唱“昆的”的时候。几曾见过大将登台唱“点绛唇”之际，兵丁也同声齐唱的情景？相反，倒是常见大将由于高音唱不上去而“偷工减料”。
    １９８６年秋，俞振飞老人率领上海昆剧团访问北京，那一次群贤毕至，上昆的“七梁十柱”几乎全来了。“角儿”一多，在广告中相互摩肩擦踵，固然可以增加号召力；然而却难免在具体戏码的前后、主次上面产生矛盾。我与一些“梁柱”是朋友，听见了一些背后的嘀咕。这要换成京剧界，早有人撂台甩手了。对此，俞振飞老人曾向笔者谈及：“这都是从你们京戏那儿学来的坏毛病！过去我们昆曲，演员轮流当主角，戏码先后无所谓。许多戏里都有‘同场曲子’，配角（在其他戏里是主角）与主角（在其他戏里是配角）要合力齐唱，结果彼此心体通泰，戏的质量和演员团结都上去了。如今，这‘同场曲子’虽然还有，但被称作‘梁’或‘柱’的几乎都不肯来了。也说不清是哪一位‘梁柱’最先不肯当别人的龙套，等到他自己当主演时，也没人来傍他了。如今再听戏中的‘同场曲子’，松松垮垮，早不是当年气氛，都是让你们京戏的‘角儿’给闹的……”
    听这“你们京戏”、“你们京戏”的口气，真觉着有点好笑。不过几年寻思下来，老人话中的道理却越发清楚明露了。目前京戏的“角儿”与“非角儿”，已经不是难于合力唱曲的问题，而是发展到常常不肯同台演出的地步。实行了承包或优化组合，“角儿”便不肯再带那七八十人的大团，“包袱沉，迈不开腿呀！”同时却又发现，带三五人至七八人走穴抄肥，简便轻捷，实惠可爱。不怕一回两次，就怕久而久之，那“非角儿”们一看——“嗬！不把我们放在眼里！好，你等着！”时机终于来到，等“角儿”抄肥达到“中量级”，忽然觉得再不进行常规演出，戏迷就会遗忘自己，于是急忙让“管事的”通知各位“非角”——×日×时，在×地点响锣排戏。然而回答却是：“您另请高明吧，咱爷们儿不伺候了……”
    还是“同场曲子”好，尽管不能照搬昔日和别处的形式。只希望“角儿”与“非角儿”能坐下一谈，更愿商与非商、官与非官都坐拢来，心平气和地想些办法。
