Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 9th.

Part of the capital's journalists today went to their organization, the All-China Journalists Association, to submit a joint letter requesting a dialogue. The association's leaders accepted the letter and promised to forward it, expressing their full support to ensure the success of this dialogue.

The joint letter requesting dialogue states: "We believe it is necessary to seek proper channels to discuss recent events in China's news industry with the central party leadership responsible for propaganda work."

One of the journalists who submitted the joint letter told reporters present that through calm and rational communication, they hope to push China's news reforms to a new level. This journalist also announced that the 1,013 signatories of the joint letter come from over 30 news organizations in the capital.

Another journalist who participated in submitting the joint letter added that the signatures were made purely as individual actions and do not represent their respective organizations.

Nearly a thousand students from universities in the capital gathered in front of the All-China Journalists Association, supporting the journalists who submitted the joint letter. They chanted slogans such as "Speak for the people, it's a big deal; Unite and revitalize China." Afterwards, some of the students also went to the gates of the People's Daily to shout slogans.
