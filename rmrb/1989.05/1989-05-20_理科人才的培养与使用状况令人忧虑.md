Title: The Cultivation and Utilization of Scientific Talent is Concerning

The process of enrolling graduate students in Beijing in 1989 has concluded, and in Beijing, the number of applicants this year is significantly lower than last year. Peking University saw a 33% drop in applicants compared to last year, while Renmin University experienced a 40% decrease. Beijing Normal University, Beijing Medical University, and other institutions saw even more pronounced declines. Overall, the trend is one of enthusiasm for the humanities and a cooling towards the sciences, with the particularly puzzling phenomenon of excellent science students choosing to pursue "human sciences" for further education.

The reasons behind this unusual situation are undoubtedly related to the economic boom affecting campuses and issues within the personnel system. Additionally, there is an important issue that cannot be overlooked: society's recognition of scientific talent.

Currently, many enterprise leaders lack an understanding of the characteristics and roles of scientific talent, believing that graduates with science degrees can only become teachers. A graduate with a degree in applied mathematics once went to a talent exchange center hoping to find suitable employment, only to leave disappointed. A graduate from the Physics Department of Jilin University was assigned to a petroleum exploration unit, but the personnel department found it difficult to place them. Upon discovering the graduate's interest in music, they were assigned to teach music at an affiliated primary school. Due to the lack of business knowledge among those in charge of personnel work or society's lack of understanding of the cultivation of scientific talent, such incidents frequently occur.

In the past two years, China has made some reforms in the personnel system and the allocation channels of universities, but the issue of how scientific talent can play a role in society has not been resolved. The contract responsibility system has improved the economic benefits of enterprises, but it has also led to "short-term behavior." Some enterprise managers focus their research and development goals solely on economic benefits within their term, and research institutes, due to the implementation of the "three guarantees and one suspension" policy, have closed their personnel doors, causing many science students to change their attitudes. Graduates with science degrees are no longer willing to engage in basic research, and many students prefer to work in private enterprises with higher incomes.

Many insightful individuals have expressed concern about this situation.

### 理科人才的培养与使用状况令人忧虑

　　理科人才的培养与使用状况令人忧虑
    １９８９年北京市研究生的报考工作已告结束，就北京地区而言：报名人数比去年相差甚远。北京大学今年报名人数比去年下降３３％，人民大学下降比例为４０％，北京师范大学、北京医科大学等院校下降趋势更为厉害。从整个报考情况来看：出现的是一种文科热、理科冷的现象，尤其令人不解的是，学业甚佳的理科生却选择了“人文科学”深造。
    造成这一反常现象的原因，无疑与经济热冲击校园和人事体制问题有关，还有一个不容忽视的问题就是社会对理科人才的认识问题。
    现在许多企业的负责人对理科人才的特点和所起的作用缺乏认识，认为学理科的毕业生只能去教书。一位学应用数学的毕业生曾去某人才交流中心希望找到合适的工作，结果扫兴而归。吉林大学物理系一毕业生分配到某石油勘探单位，人事部门负责人感到不好安排，后发现其对音乐感兴趣，便分配到附属小学教音乐。由于主管人事工作的同志不懂业务，或社会对理科人才的培养缺乏了解，使得以上事例时有发生。
    近二年来，我国在人事制度、高校的分配渠道方面作了一些改革，但社会对理科人才发挥作用问题仍没有得到解决。承包制提高了企业的经济效益，同时也出现了“短期行为”。一些企业经营者把研究与开发的目标只盯在任期内的经济效益上，科研所由于实行“三保一挂”而将人事大门紧闭，致使许多理科学生的心态发生变化，学理科的毕业生已不愿再搞基础研究，反而许多学生愿意到收入高的民办企业。
    对此，许多有识之士表示忧虑。
