A new type of drama, "Urban Cowboy," a series of reportage plays, began its run in the capital at the end of April, attracting audiences and drawing attention from various sectors of society. The play has already been performed 10 times, and audiences are reluctant to see it end.

Based on the reportage literature "Money, the Mad Beast" and "The New Tycoons of Qianmen," this drama leverages the advantages of reportage literature in its closeness to the times and direct confrontation with life. It adds fresh characters to the gallery of dramatic arts based on true stories with solid evidence. The play reveals the lost and twisted souls of some people in the face of the temptation of money in the tide of a commodity economy, which is shocking to behold. The play is scripted by Ling Shen and Liu Gang, and directed by Wen Xingyu.

"Urban Cowboy" is the inaugural production of the Central Experimental Theater after it publicly recruited a director and implemented institutional reforms, embodying the theater's "experimental" spirit and maintaining its artistic style of staying closely connected to reality.
