Today, people increasingly talk about the "Pacific Era" and the shift of the global economic center to the Pacific region. Whether or not the Pacific Era will arrive, it at least indicates that people generally recognize the significant role of the Pacific region's economy in the development of the global economy. For the countries in the Pacific region, how to promote economic cooperation in this region is a crucial issue.

The Necessity and Feasibility of Economic Cooperation in the Pacific Region

Post-war global economic development shows that countries' economies are increasingly moving towards internationalization and integration. Strengthening international economic cooperation can adjust economic relations among countries, help them achieve coordination in competition, promote the flow of resources, technology, capital, and labor within the region, achieve economic complementarity, optimize the combination of production factors, and improve economic efficiency. It also helps to rationally adjust industrial structures, carry out more conscious and effective international division of labor, and fully utilize each country's production potential.

The Pacific region, in the trend of economic internationalization, inevitably has to take the path of economic cooperation. Apart from conforming to this fundamental trend, economic cooperation in the Pacific region is also driven by many favorable conditions. First, the economies of the countries in this region have traditional historical connections, providing a good foundation for regional cooperation. Second, this region is full of economic vitality. Post-war Japan's rise, the high-speed development of the "Four Asian Tigers," the industrialization of the second-generation newly industrialized countries such as ASEAN, the revitalization of China's economy under reform and opening-up, and the economic growth momentum shown by the United States since the early 1980s all demonstrate this. Therefore, since the 1960s, the economic growth rate in the Pacific region has been higher than in other regions, making it the most dynamic region in the world. Third, abundant production factor resources and economic diversity. The Pacific region has significant advantages and potential in resources, markets, capital, and technology. It possesses more than 70% of the world's coal reserves, 45% of oil and natural gas, more than 60% of tin, and a large portion of tungsten, lead, nickel, and other non-ferrous metals, as well as natural rubber. Here, there are economically developed countries like the United States that hold a large amount of advanced technology, and Japan, the world's largest creditor nation with a large amount of surplus capital. There is also China, a country with abundant human resources and a vast potential market for investment and commodities. The differences and complementarities in economic development levels, economic structures, and economic characteristics among countries provide a broad prospect for economic cooperation in this region. Fourth, close economic ties among Pacific countries. In the Asia-Pacific region, Japan's approximately 60% of trade and foreign investment are concentrated. The U.S. trade volume with the Asia-Pacific region surpassed that with Western Europe in 1980 and is now 25% higher. The growth rate of U.S. investment in the Asia-Pacific region is also higher than its overall foreign investment growth rate. Now, Pacific countries are increasingly aware of their common interests and the importance of regional economic cooperation. Following the establishment of ASEAN, Japan proposed the concept of Pacific cooperation and the East Asian economic circle, leading to the formation of the Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Area and the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area. Subsequently, organizations such as the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference were established. All these indicate that economic cooperation in the Pacific region is continuously developing.

Obstacles Facing Economic Cooperation in the Pacific Region

Although economic cooperation in the Pacific region has made some progress, it also faces various obstacles in further cooperation. The main issues in this regard include the following. First, the Pacific region is an area where various east-west and north-south relations intersect, concentrating various contradictions. Political disagreements and oppositions limit the development of cooperation. Differences in social systems, languages, cultures, and religious beliefs all have varying degrees of adverse effects on regional cooperation. Second, there are significant disparities in the economic development levels of various countries, making cooperation more difficult. The economic development levels in this region can be roughly divided into four tiers: developed countries such as the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Japan; newly industrialized regions such as the "Four Asian Tigers" and Mexico; second-generation newly industrialized countries such as ASEAN and China; and other developing countries and regions that are still economically backward. This increases the difficulty of cooperation. First, there is the issue of unequal benefits in cooperation. Relatively backward countries have weak international competitiveness and fear that economic cooperation will lead to their national economy being controlled by developed countries and their domestic industries being damaged in competition with foreign entities. Next, the gap in economic development levels also means that the market development levels in various countries are different, making it difficult for goods and capital to flow smoothly in this region, thus limiting the expansion and deepening of cooperation. Furthermore, when various countries formulate policies and measures based on their different economic problems, it is difficult to coordinate in areas such as trade, investment, and exchange rates. Third, many countries in the Pacific region are export-oriented economies; some developing countries have similar economic conditions, and their economic structures lack complementarity, making competition and economic friction in this region serious. The current vertical division of labor between developed countries, especially Japan, and developing countries also restricts the further expansion of bilateral trade. Fourth, developed countries' economic policies towards developing countries, such as the U.S. cancellation of preferential treatment for the "Four Asian Tigers" and other trade protectionist policies. It should be noted that only when the economies of developing countries become active and continuously develop will they have the ability to expand and strengthen economic cooperation with developed countries. This requires developed countries in the Pacific region to make adjustments in their economic policies towards developing countries that are conducive to cooperation.

Prospects for Economic Cooperation in the Pacific Region

From the above economic conditions in the Pacific region, I believe it is unlikely to establish an economic integration group like the European Community, nor is it advisable to pursue common political goals. Countries will mainly cooperate in the economic field. The basic characteristics of cooperation will be loose integration. Specifically, it means: First, for the entire region, a more realistic form of cooperation is to establish a consultative dialogue organization, coordinate policies, and carry out cooperation in areas such as material, technology exchange, and resource development. Second, countries will not lose their independence in conducting external economic relations just by participating in such organizations. In other words, it is an open type of cooperation, not exclusive, and does not exclude countries from developing trade relations with countries outside the region. Third, due to the difficulty in establishing a regional economic group, countries in the region will further develop cooperative relations mainly on a bilateral basis, gradually expanding the scope of cooperation. Fourth, open-type cooperative relations are conducive to countries choosing various forms and fields to broadly establish and develop connections with the outside world. Therefore, in the future, various forms, levels, fields, and scopes of flexible, diverse, and complex cooperation relationships will appear in this region.

Of course, some countries in the Pacific region with close economic ties and smaller development gaps may establish sub-regional economic integration groups after making relatively large concessions to each other. I believe that as long as countries adhere to the principles of "mutual respect, strengthened exchanges, equality and mutual benefit, and common development," they will surely create a new situation for economic cooperation in the Pacific region.

　　太平洋地区经济合作展望
    吴大琨
    今天，人们越来越多地谈论“太平洋时代”，谈论世界经济重心向太平洋地区的转移。不管太平洋时代是否出现，它至少说明，人们普遍认识到太平洋地区经济对整个世界经济的发展具有重要意义。而对于太平洋地区各国来说，如何开展、推进这一地区的经济合作是一个十分重要的课题。
    　　　　太平洋地区经济合作的必要性与可能性
    战后世界经济的发展表明，各国经济不断朝着国际化、一体化的方向迈进。加强国际经济合作，既可以调整各国间的经济关系，使它们在竞争中求得协调，促进区域内资源、技术、资金、劳力的流动，实行经济互补，实现生产要素的优化组合，提高经济效率，也有助于合理调整产业结构，进行更自觉、有效的国际分工，充分发挥各国的生产潜力。
    太平洋地区在经济国际化趋势中也不可避免地要走上经济合作的道路。除了服从于这个基本趋势以外，太平洋地区的经济合作还受到许多有利条件的推动。第一，这一地区国家的经济有着传统的历史上的联系，为地区合作提供了良好土壤。第二，这一地区充满着经济活力。战后日本的崛起、亚洲“四小”的高速发展、东盟等第二代新兴国家的工业化、在改革与开放的推动下中国经济的振兴以及美国８０年代初以来所表现出的经济增长势头，都表明了这一点。因而，６０年代以来，太平洋地区的经济增长一直高于其他地区，成为世界上最富有活力的地区。第三，丰富的生产要素资源和经济的多样性。太平洋地区在资源、市场、资金、技术等方面都拥有巨大优势和潜力。它拥有世界７０％以上的煤储量、４５％的石油和天然气、６０％以上的锡和大部分钨、铅、镍等有色金属及生胶。这里既有掌握着大量先进技术的经济发达国家美国和拥有大量过剩资金的世界最大的债权国日本，也有中国这样拥有丰富人力资源、巨大的潜在投资和商品市场的国家。各国间经济发展水平、经济结构和经济特征上的差异与互补性为这一地区的经济合作展示了广阔的发展前景。第四，太平洋国家间密切的经济联系。在亚太地区，集中着日本大约６０％的贸易与对外投资。美国与亚太地区的贸易额１９８０年即开始超过西欧，目前已比同西欧的贸易高出１／４。美国对亚太地区投资的增长也高于其对外投资总的增长速度。现在，太平洋国家越来越认识到彼此间的共同利益和开展地区经济合作的重要性。继东盟成立之后，日本提出了环太平洋合作、东亚经济圈等构想，出现了澳新自由贸易区和美加自由贸易区，又先后成立了太平洋经济合作会议等一些组织。所有这些表明，太平洋地区的经济合作正在不断发展。
    　　　　太平洋地区经济合作面临的障碍
    虽然太平洋地区的经济合作取得了一些可喜的进展，但是在今后的进一步合作中也面临各种障碍。这方面的问题主要有以下几点。第一，太平洋是东西南北各种关系相互交错的区域，集中了各种矛盾，政治上的分歧和对立限制着合作的开展。社会制度、语言文化、宗教信仰的差异都不同程度地给地区合作带来不利影响。第二，各国经济发展水平参差不齐，很不平衡。这一地区的经济发展水平大致分为四个层次，即：美、加、澳、日等发达国家，亚洲“四小”、墨西哥等新兴工业区域，东盟等第二代新兴工业国家和中国，其他经济上还相当落后的发展中国家和地区。这增加了合作的难度。首先就是合作中利益不平等的问题。相对落后的国家国际竞争力弱，担心经济合作会使国民经济受发达国家控制以及民族工业在同外界的竞争中遭受打击。其次，经济发展水平的差距还意味着各国市场发育程度不一，商品与资金在这一地区的流动难以顺利进行，从而限制合作的扩大与深化。再次，各国根据各自不同的经济问题制订对策措施时，在贸易、投资、汇率等对外政策方面难以协调。第三，太平洋地区许多国家同属出口导向型经济；一些发展中国家经济条件相似，经济结构缺乏互补性，使这一地区的竞争与经济摩擦问题严重。发达国家特别是日本同发展中国家目前的垂直分工又限制了双方贸易的进一步扩大。第四，发达国家对发展中国家经济政策方面的问题，比如美国取消亚洲“四小”的特惠待遇等贸易保护主义政策。应该看到，只有发展中国家的经济活跃起来、不断发展，才有能力扩大和加强同发达国家的经济合作。这就要求太平洋地区的发达国家在对于发展中国家的经济政策上作出有利于合作的调整。
    　　　　太平洋地区经济合作的前景
    从上述太平洋地区的经济条件看，笔者认为，不太可能建立像欧洲共同体那样的经济一体化集团，也不宜追求共同政治目标。各国将主要在经济领域进行合作。合作的基本特征将是松散性结合。具体说就是：第一，就整个地区来说，比较现实的合作形式是建立协商对话组织，进行政策协调，在物资、技术交流和资源开发等局部领域开展合作。第二，各国并不因参加这类组织丧失自己自主开展对外经济联系的独立性。也就是说，它是一种开放型合作，不是排它的，包括不排斥各国同区域外国家发展经贸关系。第三，由于难于建立区域性经济集团，地区内各国进一步发展合作关系将主要在双边基础上进行，逐渐扩大合作范围。第四，开放型合作关系有利于各国选择各种形式和领域，广泛建立、发展同外界的联系。因此，今后出现在这一地区的将是各种不同形式、不同层次、不同领域、不同范围的灵活、多样、错综的合作关系。
    当然，太平洋地区一些经济关系密切、发展水平差距较小的国家，在相互作出较大让步后，也有可能建立次区域级经济一体化集团。我认为，如果各国本着“互相尊重、加强交流、平等互利、共同发展”的原则，一定能够开创太平洋地区经济合作的新局面。
