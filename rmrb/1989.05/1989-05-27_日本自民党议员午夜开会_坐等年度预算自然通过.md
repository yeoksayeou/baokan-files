The People's Daily, Tokyo, May 28th - Correspondent Yu Qing reports: The 27th was the last day of this session of the Diet. The budget bill, which was forced through the House of Representatives and not fully debated in the House of Councillors, can pass naturally on this day. Last night after 10 PM, Liberal Democratic Party members began arriving at the Diet, waiting for the budget bill to pass naturally at midnight on the 28th, and then to vote separately in the House of Representatives to extend the Diet by 25 days. Chief Cabinet Secretary Noboru Takeshita stated that outgoing Prime Minister Takeshita, who has already announced his resignation, will continue to govern until a new prime minister takes office.

After the Diet spent three and a half months passing the budget bill, the focus of the political situation shifted to selecting a new president of the Liberal Democratic Party. Yesterday, Prime Minister Takeshita and Secretary-General Shinzo Abe held talks, and Foreign Minister Sohei Uno was proposed as a candidate. If the negotiations go smoothly, the new president will be determined next week, and the Takeshita Cabinet will resign en masse in early June.

    国会历时３个半月通过预算案后，政局焦点转向选定自民党新总裁。昨天，竹下首相和安倍干事长会谈结果，外相宇野宗佑被提为候选人。如斡旋顺利，下周确定新总裁人选，竹下内阁将于６月初总辞职。
