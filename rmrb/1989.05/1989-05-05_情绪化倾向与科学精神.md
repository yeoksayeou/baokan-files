	The May Fourth Movement, which took place seventy years ago, was a movement that championed science and democracy. Today, as we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement during our reform and opening-up process and the construction of socialist modernization, we must not only inherit the democratic tradition of the May Fourth Movement but also promote its scientific spirit.

	For a period of time, when discussing science, people often only understand it as scientific technology. Undoubtedly, vigorously developing scientific technology is crucial for our march towards modernization. Scientific and technological achievements reflect human beings' ability to understand and transform the natural world and society. Modern scientific technology is the most active and decisive factor in new productive forces and is also a powerful driving force for the development of a modern commodity economy. In the context of the burgeoning new technological revolution worldwide, developing scientific technology and accelerating scientific and technological progress will fundamentally determine the process of China's modernization construction and is the hope for achieving economic and national rejuvenation. In the past, we lacked a clear understanding of this issue and long neglected science and technology and education. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, our understanding has not only become increasingly profound, but we have also formulated a series of correct policies and measures to address this issue. Now, we need to continue to take strong measures to truly place science and technology and education in the primary position of the economic and social development strategy.

	However, if science is understood only as scientific technology, it is too narrow. Science is a system of knowledge about nature, society, and thought, and it is the truth that reveals the necessary laws of the development of things. Therefore, science is not just scientific technology; more importantly, it is a worldview, a methodology, an attitude, and a spirit for us to understand and transform the world. It is in this sense that the pioneers of the May Fourth Movement surpassed their predecessors, raising the Chinese understanding of science from the level of artifacts to the level of culture.

	The scientific spirit, in summary, is the spirit of seeking truth from facts. In the history of the Chinese revolution and construction, we have relied on the scientific spirit to overcome many difficulties and setbacks. The two most historically significant turning points occurred in the 1930s and after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. During the 1930s, after a period of arduous and tortuous struggle, the Chinese revolution finally turned away from the tendency of dogmatizing Marxism that repeatedly occurred in the early days of the Party, successfully combining Marxist general principles with Chinese specific realities, and putting the Chinese revolution on the correct track. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we comprehensively corrected the leftist errors of the Cultural Revolution and its preceding period, liberated ourselves from the long-standing shackles of personality cult and dogmatism, and began the profound reform process by adopting the scientific attitude required by Marxism to treat Marxism itself. We started to find the path to building socialism with Chinese characteristics. These two great turning points fully embody the Chinese Communists' pursuit of truth and the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts.

	Currently, in our reform and construction, we encounter many problems and difficulties, and there are many opinions and strong emotions from the masses. Some people summarize this as a "tendency towards emotionalism" in society. We should also study this tendency with a scientific spirit.

	Mass emotions are an important social signal. They often reflect the wishes, demands, cognitions, and attitudes of the masses. Scientific understanding of mass emotions is a fundamental requirement of the Party's mass line and is an important basis for formulating and verifying the decisions of the Party and the government. Of course, "emotionalism" is still irrational and requires concrete analysis and proper guidance. People have opinions about the shortcomings in social life, especially strong dissatisfaction with inflation, unfair distribution, and corruption in society and within the Party, which is reasonable. However, when viewing the difficulties and problems in the reform process, one should scientifically analyze and rationally think. If one attributes it to the reform itself, merely complains, and criticizes that this or that is not right, or even thinks that the reform has gone wrong or failed, it will not help to overcome difficulties and solve problems. "Anger can produce poets, but anger cannot produce science." One should have less emotional impulse and more rational thinking, and create a social atmosphere of adhering to the scientific spirit.

	It is worth noting that irrational emotionalism not only exists among the masses but also among leading cadres. It should be said that the problem of economic overheating is mainly related to some leading cadres ignoring the laws of economic development, lacking a scientific spirit, and being impatient. Some comrades, in order to quickly change the appearance of the region or department they lead and to show their achievements during their term, blindly expand the scale of construction, one-sidedly pursue output, quantity, and growth rate, seek quick success and instant benefits, and are impatient for quick results. Therefore, they cause the expansion of investment scale and the rapid growth of consumption funds, exacerbating inflation. The Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee proposed the policy of rectification and deepening reform, which is correct. However, some comrades do not actively implement this policy but are afraid of losing out, complain, and observe. They do not truly suppress and cut non-productive construction and the part of social purchasing power used for extravagance and waste, but only pretend to suppress and cut. They do not stop the projects that should be stopped, or they stop them in name only. Obviously, this emotion is far from a scientific attitude.

	Comprehensive reform and modernization construction require the passion of a poet, but more importantly, they require a scientific spirit.

### 情绪化倾向与科学精神

　　情绪化倾向与科学精神
    韦典华
    七十年前，爆发了以科学与民主为旗帜的五四运动。今天，我们在改革开放、建设社会主义现代化的进程中纪念“五四”七十周年，不但要继承“五四”的民主传统，而且要弘扬“五四”的科学精神。
    一个时期以来，谈到科学，人们往往只把它理解为科学技术。毫无疑问，大力发展科学技术，对于我们向现代化进军至关重要。科学技术成果反映了人类对自然界和社会的认识能力和改造能力，现代科学技术是新生产力中最活跃的、决定性的因素，也是发展现代商品经济的强大推动力。在世界新技术革命蓬勃兴起的形势下，发展科学技术，加速科技进步，将在根本上决定我国现代化建设的进程，是实现经济振兴、民族振兴的希望所在。对于这个问题，过去我们缺乏清醒认识，长期轻视科技和教育。十一届三中全会以来，我们的认识不但越来越深刻，而且为解决这个问题制定出一系列正确的方针政策。现在需要我们继续采取强有力措施，真正把科技和教育放在经济社会发展战略的首要位置。
    但是，如果仅仅把科学理解为科学技术，那就太狭隘了。科学是关于自然、社会和思维的知识体系，是揭示事物发展必然规律的真知灼见。因此，科学决不只是科学技术；更主要的，它是一种世界观、一种方法论，是我们认识世界、改造世界的一种态度、一种精神。正是在这一点上，五四的先驱者们超越了他们的前辈，把中国人对科学的认识从器物的层面提高到文化的层面。
    科学精神，概括地说，就是实事求是的精神。在中国革命和建设历史上，我们靠科学精神战胜过许多困难和挫折，最具有历史转折意义的有两次。一次发生在本世纪三十年代，中国革命经历了一段艰难曲折之后，终于扭转了党的幼年时期一再出现的把马克思主义教条化的倾向，成功地将马克思主义普遍原理同中国具体实际相结合，使中国革命走上正确的轨道。另一次发生在十一届三中全会以后，我们全面纠正“文化大革命”及其以前的左倾错误，从长期盛行的个人迷信和教条主义精神枷锁中解放出来，用马克思主义要求的科学态度来对待马克思主义本身，开始了意义深远的改革进程，开始找到建设有中国的特色社会主义道路。这两次伟大转折，集中体现了中国共产党人追求真理，实事求是的科学精神。
    当前，我们在改革和建设中碰到很多问题，遇到很多困难，群众意见很多，情绪很大，有人概括为社会上有一种“情绪化倾向”。对这种倾向，也要用科学精神去研究。
    群众情绪是一种很重要的社会信号。它往往反映群众的愿望、要求、认识与态度，科学体察群众情绪是党的群众路线的根本要求，是制定和检验党和政府决策的重要依据。当然，“情绪化倾向”毕竟是非理性的，要具体分析，善加引导。人们对社会生活中存在的弊端有意见，特别是对通货膨胀、分配不公和社会上、党内腐败现象表示强烈不满，是合理的。但是，在看待改革进程中的困难和问题时，应当科学分析和理性思考，如果把它归之于改革本身，单纯发牢骚，指责改革这也不是，那也不是，甚至认为改革改糟了，改革失败了，就无助于克服困难，解决问题。“愤怒可以出诗人，愤怒不能出科学”。应当少一点感情的冲动，多一点理性的思考，在全社会造成坚持科学精神的风气。
    值得注意的是，非理性情绪化倾向不仅群众中有，领导干部中也有。应该说，出现经济过热的问题，主要是与某些领导干部忽视经济发展规律，缺乏科学精神，急躁情绪分不开的。有些同志为尽快改变他所领导的地区或部门的面貌，为显示自己在任期间的政绩，盲目扩大建设规模，片面追求产值产量和增长速度，急功近利，急于求成，因此造成投资规模膨胀，消费基金增长过快，加剧了通货膨胀。十三届三中全会提出治理整顿和深化改革的方针，是正确的。可是有些同志不是积极贯彻这个方针，而是生怕吃亏，埋怨、观望，对非生产性建设和重复建设，对社会集团购买力中用于铺张浪费的部分，不是真压，真砍，而是假压、假砍。该停的项目不停，或者明停暗不停。显然，这种情绪与科学态度相距甚远。
    全面改革和现代化建设，需要诗人般的激情，更需要科学精神。
