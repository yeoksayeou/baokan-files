Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 27th. The 18th Chairman's Meeting of the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was held this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. The meeting unanimously expressed its support for the correct decisions and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation. It also expressed its support for the speeches made by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party and Government Cadres' Meeting.

The meeting hoped that the members of the CPPCC and the comrades of various democratic parties would, through their extensive contacts, help people from all walks of life, the broad masses of intellectuals, and young students to understand the situation, unite the people of all ethnic groups, and jointly do a good job in stopping the turmoil and maintaining social stability.

Chairman Li Xiannian of the CPPCC attended the meeting and delivered an important speech.

The meeting conveyed and studied the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on opposing turmoil and maintaining social stability.

The meeting was presided over by Vice Chairman Wang Renzhong. Vice Chairmen Ma Wenrui, Qu Wu, Fang Yi, Sun Xiaocun, Sima Yimaiti, Cheng Siyuan, Hou Jingeru, Yan Mingfu, Qian Zhengying, and Qian Xuesen spoke at the meeting.

They believed that over the past few decades, the CPPCC, various democratic parties, and people from all walks of life have always stood together with the Communist Party through thick and thin. The CPPCC should support the measures taken by the Party and the government in the current major political struggle, and do a good job in stopping the turmoil and maintaining stability and unity.

They proposed that the broad masses of young students have expressed their opposition to official profiteering, the punishment of corruption, the promotion of democracy, and the hope for social progress and national prosperity. Their wishes are good, and their demands are reasonable, which are consistent with the goals of the Party and the government. They hoped that the broad masses of students would consider the overall situation, return to school as soon as possible, and strive to learn well, so as to undertake the heavy responsibility of history. They believed that the Party and the government would definitely seriously listen to the opinions of the broad masses of students and the people, take effective measures, and overcome the existing problems, so as to ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and reform and opening up.

They pointed out that the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army executing the martial law, the armed police maintaining the social order of the capital, and the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, medical personnel, and cadres who are on duty have made great efforts and important contributions under difficult conditions. In this struggle, the working class has performed well and is indeed the main force of the Four Modernizations. The broad masses of peasants, intellectuals, and people from all walks of life have also performed well. We express our sincere condolences and heartfelt thanks to them.

Chairman Li Xiannian said in his concluding remarks that for a long time, the correct policy of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping has not been well implemented, resulting in a certain degree of ideological confusion. Recently, a very small number of people have plotted behind the scenes, fabricated rumors, incited and provoked, and arbitrarily expanded the situation, attempting to achieve their political goal of denying the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system through turmoil. If their plot succeeds, our country and nation will fall into deep disaster. All patriotic and conscientious citizens, including various democratic parties, the broad masses of intellectuals, and people from all walks of life, as well as the broad masses of young students, do not want to see this tragedy and will absolutely not allow it.

Li Xiannian sincerely hoped that all members of the CPPCC could put the overall situation first, understand and support the measures taken by the Party and the government. He said that the important reason for the current complex situation is that some people in the leadership of the Communist Party do not understand the facts. He was fully convinced that after they understood the facts, they would definitely more resolutely support the decisions made by the Party and the government.

After Chairman Li Xiannian's speech, the attendees applauded warmly and unanimously expressed their support.

Also attending the meeting were the vice-secretaries of the CPPCC and the responsible cadres of the CPPCC office.

In the afternoon of May 27th, the 18th Chairman's Meeting of the 7th National Committee of the CPPCC was held in Zhongnanhai, Beijing. The meeting unanimously supported the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil.

　　全国政协昨天举行主席会议
    一致拥护党中央国务院决策
    李先念出席会议并作重要讲话
    新华社北京５月２７日电  政协第七届全国委员会第十八次主席会议今天下午在中南海举行。会议一致表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院为制止动乱、稳定局势作出的正确决策和采取的果断措施，坚决拥护李鹏、杨尚昆同志在中央和北京市党政军干部大会上的讲话。
    会议希望政协委员、各民主党派同志通过各自广泛的联系，帮助各界人士、广大知识分子和青年学生认清形势，团结各族人民群众，共同做好制止动乱、维护社会安定的工作。
    全国政协主席李先念出席了会议并作了重要讲话。
    会议传达并学习了党中央、国务院关于反对动乱、维护社会安定的指示精神。
    会议由王任重副主席主持，马文瑞、屈武、方毅、孙晓村、司马义·艾买提、程思远、侯镜如、阎明复、钱正英、钱学森副主席先后在会上发了言。
    他们认为，几十年来，人民政协、各民主党派和各界人士同共产党一直风雨同舟、患难与共。人民政协在当前这场大是大非的政治斗争中，要支持党和政府所采取的措施，做好制止动乱、维护安定团结的工作。
    他们提出，广大青年学生提出反对官倒，惩治腐败，促进民主，希望社会进步、国家富强等等，愿望是好的，要求是合理的，同党和政府的目标是一致的。他们希望广大学生顾全大局，尽快回学校复课，努力学好本领，以承担起历史的重任。他们表示相信，党和政府一定会认真听取广大学生和群众的意见，采取有力措施，克服存在的问题，以保证社会主义建设和改革、开放的顺利进行。
    他们指出，执行戒严任务的人民解放军官兵，维护首都社会秩序的武警部队和广大公安干警，坚守工作岗位的广大工人、农民、知识分子、医务人员、机关干部，在困难的条件下，做出了巨大努力和重要贡献。在这场斗争中，工人阶级表现很好，不愧是四化建设的生力军，广大农民、知识分子和各界人士表现也很好，我们对他们表示亲切的慰问和衷心的感谢。
    李先念主席最后讲话说，长期以来，邓小平同志提出的坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的正确方针没有得到很好的贯彻执行，造成了一定程度的思想混乱。最近，极少数人幕后策划，制造谣言，挑拨煽动，恣意扩大事态，企图通过动乱，达到他们否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度的政治目的。如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们的国家和民族就会陷入深重的灾难之中。一切爱国的、有良知的公民，包括各民主党派、广大知识分子和各界人士，也包括广大青年学生，都是不愿意看到这种悲剧的，也是绝对不会容许的。
    李先念真诚地希望各位政协委员能以大局为重，理解、支持党和政府所采取的措施。他说，许多人不了解事实真相，造成目前这种复杂局面的一个重要原因，是在我们共产党内部领导层的个别人。我完全相信，在他们了解了事实真相后，是一定会更加坚决地拥护党和政府所作出的决策的。
    李先念主席讲话后，与会同志热烈鼓掌，一致表示拥护。
    出席今天会议的还有全国政协的副秘书长和政协机关的负责干部。
