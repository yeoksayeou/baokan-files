Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 23rd.

Recently, the long-distance bus station in Jinan, our province, has been in a state of disorder.

The waiting room is dirty and chaotic. Garbage and spit stains are scattered across the floor; individual vendors weave through the crowd, shouting their sales pitches incessantly; passengers do not queue in order according to their ticket numbers, causing severe overcrowding.

There are no fixed drop-off points. This bus station has at least two drop-off points, but there is no pattern to where incoming buses stop, and no one can provide a clear answer when asked. This leaves people picking up friends and family unsure of where to wait.

There is chaos in ticket pricing. On February 3rd, my wife and I boarded a bus from the Jinan long-distance bus station. Due to the station's chaotic order, although we bought tickets that were not for an extra service, we were forced to board an extra service bus. The station then demanded an additional 5 yuan from each passenger for taking the extra service bus.

I hope the relevant departments will seriously address the management issues at the Jinan long-distance bus station, so that the world-renowned Spring City can leave a good impression on every visitor.

### 济南长途汽车站秩序不佳

　　济南长途汽车站秩序不佳
    最近，我省济南长途汽车站秩序混乱。
    候车室脏乱。地板上的垃圾、痰迹随处可见；个体小贩在乘客中间挤来挤去，叫卖声不绝于耳；乘客不按车票序号排队上车，拥挤不堪。
    无固定下车点。这个汽车站至少有两个下车点，进站汽车到底在哪里停，根本没有规律，而且问谁谁也说不清。弄得接亲友的人不知在哪里等人。
    乱提票价。２月３日，我与妻子从济南长途汽车站上车。由于车站秩序十分混乱，我们买的虽不是加班车车票，但却不得不上了加班车。而站方则以乘的是加班车为理由，要每位上车的旅客再交５元车费。
    希望有关部门认真抓一抓济南长途汽车站的管理工作，使举世闻名的泉城能在每一位光临的客人心中留下美好的印象。
