The city of Yingtan in Jiangxi Province, which is part of the third batch of national housing reform pilot cities, released its housing reform plan in September of last year. Citizens found the prices reasonable and eagerly purchased homes.

The city adopted a preferential method for the sale price of housing, making it affordable for the public. New homes are sold at a preferential price of 155.74 yuan per square meter of building area, calculated based on various factors, making workers feel that buying a home is more cost-effective than renting. For workers purchasing old homes before the housing reform, the price is calculated with a discount based on the structure, quality, completion time of the house, and the standard price of new homes. The initial payment is 30%, and the remaining balance is paid in 10 installments, with the unit charging a 2.4% monthly interest. Units with conditions can subsidize the interest or not charge any.

After the release of Yingtan's housing reform plan, citizens began to do the math: purchasing a home with a building area of 80 square meters only requires 12,459 yuan, with an initial payment of 30%, amounting to 3,737 yuan, equivalent to the price of a large color TV; a general reinforced concrete structure home can last at least 60 years. If the home is purchased, it is equivalent to not paying 40 years of rent, and the home ownership belongs to the buyer; even if the home maintenance fees and loan interest are added, the total expenditure is only about 53% of the rent that would have been paid over 60 years.

Starting from January 1 of this year, more than 2,000 people in the city have applied to purchase homes, and 478 households have completed the procedures. The state can recover 4.67 million yuan in housing funds.

　　价格定得合理
    鹰潭市民踊跃购买住房
    本报南昌５月２５日电  列为全国第３批房改试点城市的江西省鹰潭市，去年９月推出房改方案，市民感到价格合理，购房踊跃。
    该市对出售住房的价格采取群众力所能及的优惠办法。新房出售按照各种因素折算的结果，实行每平方米建筑面积售价为１５５．７４元的优惠价，使职工感到买房比租房划得来。对于职工买房改前的旧住宅，按照房屋结构、质量、竣工时间和新住宅标准价等参照系，给以一个折扣再计算价格，首次付款３０％，余额采取分１０期付款的方式，单位收取２．４％的月息，有条件的单位可以贴息或不收利息。
    鹰潭市的房改方案公布之后，市民纷纷算开了帐：买１套建筑面积８０平方米的住房，只需１２４５９元，先付３０％，才３７３７元，相等于１台大彩电的钱；而一般混凝土结构住房至少可住６０年，如果买下住房，等于少交４０年左右的房租，而且住房产权归己；即使加上房屋维修费和贷款利息，全部花费也只占６０年应交房租的５３％左右。
    从今年１月１日开始，全市申请买房的已有２０００多人，已办好手续的有４７８户，国家可回收建房资金４６７万元。
