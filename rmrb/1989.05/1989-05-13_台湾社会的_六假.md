On April 22nd, the Taiwanese newspaper "United Daily News" published an article by Zhao Ning titled "Possessing Six Fakes," which enumerated the six prevalent forms of deceit in Taiwanese society:

1. Fake Medicine: "The promotion of tonic medicines is rampant, causing panic among men, women, and children. The label of 'Sick Man of East Asia' still lingers, and the island has once again become a market for medicines. Medicine is the means to treat illness and sustain life. If medicine can be fake, then what can't be fake? When can't it be fake? Where can't it be fake? This is truly terrifying. I believe that fake medicine is a significant indicator of the deterioration of human nature."

2. Fake Laughter: "When the boss tells a joke, not laughing might mean losing your job. With full breath, mouths wide open, 'hahahahahaha.' Social interactions have become tools for power struggles. Thus, smiling upon seeing someone, but stabbing them in the back, becomes a natural occurrence. Life turns into a stage, with joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness all being acted out. The tragedy of the mundane world lies in this."

3. Fake Love: "My family's education is top-notch, Dad loves playing poker, Mom loves playing mahjong, and my sister teaches me to dance the cha-cha. Teaching children only about consumer entertainment and not about productive skills is a result of adults seeking enjoyment."

4. Fake Wealth: "Economic growth is unparalleled, with fish to eat and cars to drive. What is most appropriate now? Playing mahjong, visiting a wife, and getting a massage. A culture that only knows how to eat, drink, and play is a barren wasteland, a poor rich person."

5. Fake Righteousness: "People make friends based on wealth, and if wealth is scarce, friendships are shallow. Just look at the wine during banquets, the first toasts are always for the wealthy. If fame and fortune are the thermometers of social indifference, then in today's Taipei, money has become the unit of 'righteousness.' Morality is less important than the law, the law is less important than relationships, and relationships are less important than New Taiwan dollars. Thus, people forget righteousness for profit and align with money."

6. Fake Words: "A kind word warms three winters, harsh words chill even in summer. When dealing with people, one must speak sweetly, and flattery costs nothing. Neighbors are like strangers, snakes and rats are everywhere. To preserve oneself, everyone speaks differently to different people, seeing a person and speaking like a person, seeing a ghost and speaking like a ghost. Human communication is pitifully reduced to empty pleasantries and meaningless verbal symbols. Every soul is an island, wanting to build a bridge, but all one sees are fortresses. Words are left unsaid, and hearts are not fully revealed."

The article argues that if a society openly engages in deceit, it signifies a decline in social morality, gradually leading to decay and corruption.

### 台湾社会的“六假”

　　台湾社会的“六假”
    ４月２２日台湾《联合报》上赵宁《身怀六假》的文章列数了台湾社会的六假：
    一、假药：“补药宣传大猖狂，男女老少皆惊慌，东亚病夫名犹在，宝岛又成药市场。”药乃治病之方、蓄命之舟，药犹可假，那何事不可假？何时不可假？何处不可假？实在可怕。我觉得假药是人性趋恶的重大指标。
    二、假笑：“老板讲个小笑话，不笑恐怕饭碗砸，中气运足嘴张大，哈哈哈哈哈哈哈。”交际成了争权夺利的工具，那么一见你就笑，背后捅把刀，就是天经地义之事，人生变成了舞台，喜、怒、哀、乐，都在演戏，红尘之悲，以此为最。
    三、假爱：“我家家教顶瓜瓜，爸爸喜欢打梭哈，妈妈爱把麻将搓，姊姊教我篷恰恰。”只教孩子消费性娱乐，不教孩子生产性本领，是大人贪图享受的后遗症。
    四、假阔：“经济成长世无匹，食有鱼兮出有车，尔今何事最相宜，麻将午妻马杀鸡。”一个只懂得吃喝玩乐的文化沙漠，是贫乏阔佬，有钱的穷人。
    五、假义：“世人结交虚黄金，黄金不多交不深，不信但看宴中酒，杯杯先敬有钱人。”如果功名利禄是世态炎凉的温度计，那么在今日台北，金钱早已是“义”的计值单位。道义不如法律，法律不如交情，交情不如新台币，于是见利忘义，向钱看齐。
    六、假话：“好话一句三冬暖，恶言一句六月寒，待人接物嘴要甜，拍马屁又不花钱。”比邻若天涯，蛇鼠四处爬，为了明哲保身，大家都见人说人话，见鬼说鬼话，人际沟通可怜只剩下客套，和没有意义的口述符号，每一个灵魂都是孤岛，想要搭桥，只见四处都是碉堡，也只有话到嘴边留半句，不敢全抛一片心。
    文章认为，一个社会，如果大家公然作假，那就意味着世风日下，开始逐渐地凋零腐化。
