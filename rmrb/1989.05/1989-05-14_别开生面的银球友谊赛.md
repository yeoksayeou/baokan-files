A Unique Ping-Pong Friendship Match

The crew of the mining vessel Minhai from the Qingdao Ocean Shipping Company recently set sail to the Soviet Union. At the invitation of the Novorossiysk Seamen's Club, they held a unique friendship match with the local ping-pong team. The Minhai team's first players to take the court were deckhand Liu Fuxin, cook Qu Zhanglin, and Captain Meng Qingrong. Liu Fuxin is skilled in looping shots and is one of the key players of the company's ping-pong team; Captain Meng is still in top form and personally led the team to compete; Qu Zhanglin is also a good ping-pong player on the Minhai.

After a while, second deckhand Wang Deren, mechanic Luo Guoqing, sailor Wang Xunlin, and political commissar Yu Xihe also took turns to compete with the opposing team. The most eye-catching match was between the 57-year-old political commissar Yu Xihe and an 8-year-old opponent. Yu Xihe was seen pushing and blocking the ball, while the young player used both forehand and backhand to loop the ball effortlessly. The old and the young fought a close match, with the audience cheering and clapping, creating a lively atmosphere on the court.

The opposing club's ping-pong team is the best representative team in Novorossiysk. Although the Minhai team members gave their best, they were still defeated by the opponents. This joyful and intense friendship match left a good impression on the local spectators, enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two sides.

　　别开生面的银球友谊赛
    青岛远洋运输公司矿海轮最近出航苏联期间，应诺沃罗西斯克市海员俱乐部的邀请，同当地乒乓球代表队进行了一场别开生面的友谊比赛。矿海轮队首先出场的是四车刘夫新、三厨曲章林，船长孟庆荣。刘夫新擅长弧圈球，是公司乒乓球队的主力队员之一；孟船长老当益壮，亲自带队参赛；曲章林也是矿海轮较好的乒乓球选手。
    过了一会儿，二车王德仁、机工罗国清、水手王训林、政委于锡和等也都轮番上场同对方展开较量。最引人注目的要数５７岁的政委于锡和同对方一个８岁小队员之间的比赛，只见于政委左推右挡，小选手正反手拉弧圈球，应付自如。这一老一小，打得难分难解，观众为他们鼓掌加油，场上气氛非常活跃。
    对方这个俱乐部乒乓球队，是诺沃罗西斯克市的最佳代表队。虽然矿海轮的队员尽了自己的最大努力，但还是不敌对手。这场欢快而又激烈的友谊比赛给当地观众留下了很好的印象，增进了双方的了解和感情。
