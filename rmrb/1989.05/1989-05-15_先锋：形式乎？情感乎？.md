Avant-garde or the new wave in art is a fashionable and sensitive topic, but the current discussions on the avant-garde are quite classical. These discussions show that some critics of the avant-garde basically use the "emotional approach" to analyze the avant-garde. They always try to find a unified emotion (let's call it "avant-garde emotion") among a series of avant-garde works that appear to be vastly different on the surface but are essentially the same. They seem to firmly believe that the avant-garde is all about "writing for emotion," and thus the interpretation of the works lies in excavating, analyzing, and grasping these emotions from the text, and then linking these emotions with their background (such as the modern and postmodern society, and various situations that humans face) for interpretation. Therefore, many critics tend to view the avant-garde as a small group of individuals within modern society who are at odds with the mainstream thoughts and emotions but are closely connected within their own group. For example, some critics claim that "...Mo Yan, Han Shaogong, and Su Tong, with their different styles and methods, have embodied the emotional power of avant-garde novels..." Obviously, he has set an emotional standard for avant-garde novels in his statement. Regarding the unique qualities of avant-garde artists in terms of temperament and talent, the descriptions of some critics indicate that they are not based on the actual emotions of individual avant-garde artists but are predetermined with a certain avant-garde personality and avant-garde emotion—“Avant-garde artists are unique individuals who emerge from the depths of their personal selves and merge into the souls of a few elite members of humanity. They are definitely at odds with today's reality; they are spiritual vagabonds...”—and then they are deduced, derived, and their characteristics are marked.

However, this "emotional approach" brings difficulties to specific criticism and evaluation, that is, when evaluating works, one has to link them to the author and use the author's life attitude to verify the posture in the text. Haven't we often heard various accusations about "pseudo-modernists"? These accusations ultimately boil down to "affectation" and "artifice," that is, this criticism is based on whether the author possesses modern emotions or is just putting on a show and being artificial. If the author's true emotions do not match what is expressed, then it is a pseudo-text. But—here's the problem—once we leave the text, how can critics determine the author's true emotions and use them as a reference for the text? Can we just determine whether an artist possesses avant-garde emotions based on the ratio of high-protein, high-fat, and carbohydrates in their stomach or based on the level of industrial and material civilization they enjoy? Or should we use the emotions expressed in the works of Western modernists and avant-garde artists as a standard to compare Chinese writers?

However, the most crucial point is not here. The key is whether the artist's life emotions correspond to a certain form of expression? Is there a stable and unchanging bridge between the variability of emotions and the relative stability of forms? So-called avant-garde novels are generally recognized by their formal characteristics, the uniqueness, innovativeness, and anti-traditional nature of their narrative language and expression methods. From Kafka, Joyce, Proust to Faulkner, Borges, Robbe-Grillet, Sarraute, Marquez, and a series of early avant-garde artists to contemporary avant-garde artists, what attracts attention is first and foremost the unique appearance shown by the forms of their works (the form of a work is the sum of all specific methods, language styles, and plot structures). Naturally, every form has emotions as its foundation; emotions give birth to forms! But this is only one aspect. The mystery and difficulty of literature and art lie in the fact that forms and artists' emotions do not correspond to each other. The factors that determine an artist's sense of form are quite numerous, and the various arrangements and combinations of these factors will present an infinitely complex appearance. Critics can explore and understand artists' emotions based on forms, but they can never determine the appearance of an artist's works based on a certain emotion of the artist. Otherwise, the mysteries of "inspiration," "genius," etc., would have been solved long ago. Moreover, the avant-garde nature of the avant-garde lies precisely in the innovation and unpredictability of forms. Therefore, the avant-garde is better described as a group of artists with a keen sense of form and the ability to master forms, rather than a group of artists who deeply harbor anti-traditional emotions. Their advantage over general artists—artists who follow traditional paths—lies not in the uniqueness, individuality, and anti-mainstream nature of their emotions, but in the innovativeness, uniqueness, exclusivity, and anti-traditional nature of their artistic expression forms. The genius of avant-garde masters lies in their ability to express forms in life perceptions. With their touch, even the most ordinary materials will take on a lively and vigorous appearance.

This does not exclude the role of emotions as the soil for artistic creation. However, whether it is avant-garde artists or traditional artists, whether it is artists or non-artists, strictly speaking, everyone's emotions are unique, individual, and irreplicable, just as there are no two identical raindrops in nature. It's just that people may not be aware of this, or even if they are aware, they may not be able to obtain a form of expression. Generally, people are used to identifying their emotions with traditional, popular, or already publicly recognized and named mass emotions, and this identification is completed through the identification of forms. All inexpressible emotions can be integrated and classified into expressible ones through various forms. An artist who has received artistic training and education and has a certain level of artistic accomplishment will not find it difficult to master a series of formal means. Due to the traditional inheritance relationship of this form, the emotions that the artist is immersed in and the emotions that the reader receives from it are easily assimilated by tradition. Therefore, such artists are often mistakenly considered to lack individuality, richness, and strength in emotions, but in reality, they lack the creativity and regenerative power of forms, a capability that is only manifested in a few artistic pioneers. Therefore, if there are any pseudo-avant-garde or pseudo-modernist movements, they are pseudo in terms of plagiarism and patchwork of forms. Only traditional art, art that is popular with the masses, allows patchwork, imitation, inheritance, and apprenticeship, because tradition is rooted and rests in imitation and inheritance. Avant-garde art, however, does not allow such practices, just as the avant-garde cannot march in the ranks or at the tail of the ranks; they should lead the way. The avant-garde is not easily accepted by the masses not because they are obstructed by the individuality and small-group nature of their emotions, but because they use shocking methods in personal emotional communication, breaking the rules of communication: their attitude and methods make ordinary readers feel abrupt. Many disputes in interpersonal communication also arise from this, as the inability to accept the other party's attitude causes the communication that could have taken place to be interrupted. Attitude is a form of expression.

Every era has its own avant-garde, and the artistic avant-garde in every era does not coincide with the avant-garde of ideas, thoughts, and emotions. The "Roots-Seeking" school can be avant-garde, and the modernist school can also be avant-garde. The key lies in the unprecedented nature of artistic forms!

　　先锋：形式乎？情感乎？
    蒋原伦
    ●先锋派与其说是一小批深怀反传统情绪的艺术家，不如说是具有形式感受力和驾取力的人物。
    ●先锋派之所以难以为大众接受，不是他们缺乏情感的个人性和小团体性，而是他们在个人情感交流时运用了惊世骇俗的手段，打破了常规。
    ●每个时代的文学都有自己的先锋，关键在于艺术形式的前无古人。
    先锋派或日新潮艺术是一个时髦而敏感的话题，但是，目前有关先锋派的议论却相当古典，这些议论表明，某些先锋的批评者们基本是以“情感说”来解析先锋派的。因为他们总是企图在一系列先锋作品中寻找出表面彼此迥异、实质各方统一的情感来（姑且名之为“先锋情感”），他们似乎深信，先锋派全是“为情造文”因此作品的破译全在于从文本中挖掘、解析和把握这些情感，并且把这种情感同产生它们的背景（如现代化和后现代化的社会、人类所处的种种境遇）联系起来加以阐释。由此，不少论者都倾向于把先锋派看成是现代社会中一小群与大众思想感情格格不入而在其内部又息息相通的人物，比如有的论者断言“……莫言、残雪、史铁生以各自不同的风格和不同的方式体现了新潮小说的情绪力……”很显然，他已在表述中设定了作为新潮小说标志的情感。关于先锋派艺术家在情趣和秉赋上的卓异之处，他们情绪和气质的某些特征及他们与芸芸众生相抗衡时所保卫的那一份个人情感小天地，有的论者的描述表明，他并不是根据先锋艺术家们个别的真实的情感加以归纳而来，而是先验地设定一种先锋人格和先锋情感——“先锋们是从个人深处走出又融入人类少数精英分子灵魂的独特者，他们和今日的现实肯定格格不入，他们是一些精神上的游离分子……”，——然后再予以演绎、衍化、标明其特征的。
    然而，这种“情感说”给具体的批评和评价带来了难点，即在评品作品时不得不联系到作者，以作者的生活态度来验证其文本中的姿态。我们不是常常能听到有关“伪现代派”的种种指责吗？这些指责最终落到“矫情”、“造作”等情形上，亦即这种批评是从作者是否具有现代情感还是仅仅是装腔作势、矫揉造作来立论的，如果作者的真实情感与所表现出来的不符，那就是伪文本。可是——问题来了，一旦离开了文本，批评家又如何来断定作家的真实情感是什么，并以此来与文本相参照？难道我们仅仅能根据艺术家胃里高蛋白高脂肪与碳水化合物的比例或者根据他们所享受的工业文明物质文明的程度来判定其是否具备先锋情感？再或者以西方现代派先锋派在其作品中表现出来的情绪为尺度来比照中国的作家？
    然而问题的顶顶关键之处还不在这里，关键在于艺术家的生活情感是不是与某种表现形式相对应？情绪的易变性和形式的相对固定性之间是否有一座稳固的、不易变迁的桥梁？所谓先锋小说，一般是从形式特征、叙事语言表现手法的独特性、开创性和反传统性上来加以确认的。从卡夫卡、乔伊斯、普鲁斯特到福克纳、博尔赫斯、罗伯—戈利叶、萨洛特、马尔克斯等等一系列早年的先锋到当代的先锋，其引人瞩目之处首先是他们的作品形式所显示出来的独特风貌（作品形式是所有的具体手法、语言方式和情节结构的总和）。自然，任何一种形式背后都有情感作基础，情感孕育形式！但只是一个方面，文学和艺术的神秘性和难解性就在于形式和艺术家的情感不构成对应关系，决定艺术家形式感的因素相当多，这些因素的诸种排列和组合会呈现出无限复杂的面貌。批评家可以依据形式来探索和认识艺术家的情感，但是绝不可能从某一艺术家的某种情感出发来断定他们的作品会显露何等的容貌。否则有关“灵感”、“天才”等等之谜早就不成其为问题。更何况先锋派的先锋性恰恰就在于形式的首创和难以预料上，所以先锋派与其说是一小批深怀反传统情绪的艺术家，不如说是具有形式感受力和形式驾驭能力的人物，他们比起一般艺术家——走传统路子的艺术家来，优长之处不在于情感的独特性、个人性和排大众性，而在于艺术表现形式的开创性、独异性、排他性和反传统性。先锋大师们的天赋在于生活感悟中的形式表现力，随手可得的材料一经他们点拨，便有了充溢生气和活力的模样儿。
    这里不排除艺术创造中情感作为形式的土壤的作用。但是，无论是先锋艺术家还是传统艺术家，无论是艺术家还是非艺术家，严格地说，每个人的情感都是独特的，个别的和不可重复的，就如自然界没有两滴相同的水珠。只是人们未必意识到这一点或即便意识到也未必能获得某种表现性形式。一般人习惯于把自己的情感认同于传统的、流行的或已被公开确认的和已被命名的大众情感，而这种认同是通过形式的认同来完成的。所有的不可名状的情感都可通过各类形式加以整合、归类成为可以名状的。一个接受过艺术训练教育、有一定艺术素养的艺术家是不难掌握一系列形式手段的，由于这种形式同传统的继承关系，艺术家浸润在其中的情感和读者从中接受到的情感都很容易被传统同化。因此，这类艺术家往往被误认为是情感缺乏个性、丰富性和力度的，实质上他们缺乏的恰恰是形式的创造力和再生力，这种能力只有在少数艺术先锋身上才体现出来。所以，如果有什么伪先锋派、伪现代派存在，那是伪在形式的抄袭和拼凑上。只有传统的艺术，大众喜闻乐见的艺术才允许拼凑、模仿、因袭和师承，因为传统就是在因袭和继承中落脚喘息的。而先锋艺术是不允许如此的，正如先锋不能行进在队列中和队列之尾那般，他们应当昂首于前列。先锋派之所以不能为大众轻易接受，不是因为受阻于他们情感的个人性和小团体性，而是他们在个人情感交流时运用了惊世骇俗的手段，打破了交流的常规：他们的这种态度这种方式使一般读者感到突兀。人际交往中的许许多多争执也正是源于此，由于不能接受对方的态度而使本可以进行的交流中断。态度就是形式的一种。
    每个时代有每个时代的先锋，每个时代中艺术的先锋与观念、思想、情感的先锋并不合二而一。寻根派可以是先锋派，现代派也可以是先锋派。关键在艺术形式的前无古人！
