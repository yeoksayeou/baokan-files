About 50 kilometers from Chengdu lies Huilong Village in Huilong Township, Jianyang County, known far and wide as the "Dwarf Village." In this village of around 30 households, there are more than 10 individuals with heights of around 90 centimeters. Additionally, at least 15 young people have legs that cannot support their body weight, completely losing their ability to work.

During an on-site interview, the reporter observed five adult men, each about 90 centimeters tall, struggling to climb onto chairs that are normally used for sitting. During the conversation, it was found that their intelligence was normal, and they spoke fluently, unlike villagers from remote areas who appear shy and awkward when meeting strangers. It turns out that they had received many visitors from outside the village.

According to the village head, in the past, no one in the village had this disease. Starting in 1958, some people began experiencing bone pain, and later it was discovered that some children were not growing taller. Preventive health and medical institutions at the provincial, municipal, and county levels had all sent personnel, and they had tested the water, soil, grain, and hair here, but no toxic substances or deficiencies in elements were found. The mystery of the "Dwarf Village" remains unsolved.

　　回龙村矮人之谜待解
    本报讯  距成都５０公里的简阳县回龙乡回龙村，是远近闻名的“矮子村”。这村３０来户人家中，身高９０厘米左右的矮人就有１０多个，另外至少还有１５位青年双腿支撑不住身体的重量，完全丧失了劳动能力。
    笔者实地采访时发现，５名身高９０厘米的成年男子，正吃力地爬上平常人坐的凳子。交谈中发现，他们智力正常，谈吐自如，不像闭塞地方的村民见了生人木讷呆板的样子，原来他们多次接待过来自外地的参观者。
    据村长介绍，过去村里没有人得这种病，自１９５８年以后，有人开始骨头疼，后来又发现有的孩子不长个了。省、地、县防疫机构和卫生部门都派人来过，也化验了这里的水、土、粮食、头发等，没听说含有什么毒素或缺乏什么元素，“矮子村”之谜至今未能揭开。
