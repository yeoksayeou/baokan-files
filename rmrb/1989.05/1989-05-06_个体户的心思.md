In Changde City, Hunan Province, an individual household operator said, "I plan to rent out my shop to someone else and put the money in the bank to earn interest." He calculated that if he deposits 50,000 yuan in the bank, he can earn over 6,000 yuan in interest in a year, which is much more relaxing than setting up a stall or standing behind a counter; if he participates in value-preserving savings, he can earn even more interest.

Last year, during the period when the public rushed to withdraw money and buy goods, many individual industrial and commercial households made a fortune. Now, things are different. There are more competitors, raw material prices have increased, and money comes in more slowly. They have new plans. An individual printing factory owner in the city also plans to close his business, sell his equipment, and then deposit 100,000 yuan in the bank, earning interest while observing the market trends.

"Thinking of changing your line of business?" someone asked.

"This business or that business, profit is key. When the time is right, any business will do," they replied.

　　个体户的心思
    湖南省常德市有位个体户说：“我准备把门面租给别人，把钱存在银行吃利息。”他算了一笔帐说，把５万元存入银行，一年可得息６０００多元，比出摊站柜台轻松多了；如参加保值储蓄，得利还多一倍。
    去年群众提款抢购时，许多个体工商户发了一笔财。如今不同昔日。竞争对手多，原材料涨价，来钱慢了，他们自有新盘算。该市的一位个体印刷厂主也准备歇业，打算出卖设备，然后拿出１０万元存入银行，边吃利息，边观察行情。
    “想改个行档？”有人问。
    “这行那行，利大为上。时运一到，干哪行都一样。”他们回答。
