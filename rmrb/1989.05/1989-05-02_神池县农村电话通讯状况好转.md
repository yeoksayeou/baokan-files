After your newspaper published the letter from a reader titled "Poor and Insufficient Telephone Service in Shenqi, Making Information Transmission in Rural Areas Difficult" on January 28, our county immediately took the following measures:

1. Funds allocated annually for telephone maintenance in each township and town must not be misappropriated.
2. Each township and town, as well as the county postal and telecommunications bureau, must immediately rectify and properly assign county, township, and village line workers. Ensuring the smooth operation of rural telephones should be one of the standards for evaluating the work of township and town leaders.
3. The role of public supervision and media oversight should be leveraged. If telephone lines malfunction and the issue cannot be resolved promptly, appropriate actions should be taken against the line workers and the relevant township and town leaders.

Following the meeting, the county postal and telecommunications department and each township organized personnel to take action. After one and a half months of repairs, more than 95% of the villages in the county have telephone service.

　　神池县农村电话通讯状况好转
    你报１月２８日刊登《神池电话差又少，乡村传递信息难》的读者来信后，我县立即制定了以下措施：
    一、每年拨给各乡镇维修电话的资金不得挪用。
    二、各乡镇及县邮电局立即整顿和配备好县、乡、村线务员，把确保农村电话畅通作为考核乡镇领导工作的标准之一。
    三、发挥群众和舆论的监督作用，如电话线路发生故障不能及时解决，要对线务员和所属乡镇领导人酌情处理。
    会后，县邮电部门和各乡镇组织人员分头行动，经过一个半月的修复，全县９５％以上的村庄通了电话。
