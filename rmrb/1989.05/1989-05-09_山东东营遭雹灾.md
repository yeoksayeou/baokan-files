Dongying in Shandong Hit by Hailstorm

    Shandong Province's Dongying City was struck by a severe hailstorm. Twenty-four high-voltage power lines and 440 oil wells in the Shengli Oilfield were shut down, and 700,000 mu (approximately 46,700 hectares) of crops were severely damaged.

    From 13:24 to 15:44 on May 8, Dongying City experienced a massive hailstorm. Over the course of 2 hours and 20 minutes, the average depth of hail in the affected areas reached 12 centimeters, with the largest hailstones measuring 22 centimeters in diameter. The hailstorm caused significant losses to the region's industrial and agricultural production. Following the disaster, leaders from Dongying City and the Shengli Oilfield held an emergency meeting to take measures and organize workers and the public to carry out production and self-rescue efforts, aiming to minimize the losses caused by the hailstorm.
