Since the beginning of spring, a drought not seen in over 40 years has engulfed Bangladesh, with no signs of abating. In addition, tornadoes, storms, and heatwaves have frequently struck this disaster-prone country.

Bangladesh's climate is characterized by either floods or droughts. This year, the spring season brought an unprecedented drought, with only 125 millimeters of rain from February to the present, which is less than a quarter of the normal rainfall. The central agricultural region of Bangladesh has seen cracked earth, withered crops, and dried-up irrigation canals. Many areas are facing severe water shortages for both humans and livestock. Official estimates suggest that this year's wheat and rice yields may be halved, with fruits and vegetables even more severely affected.

Due to the prolonged drought, the hot season has arrived earlier than usual. While temperatures in the southern part of Pakistan, which is at the same latitude as Bangladesh, are around 35°C, Bangladesh has already reached 43°C. In the past week, over 40 people have died directly from the heatwave. Due to a lack of fresh drinking water, many people have contracted infectious diarrhea, with over 1,100 deaths already reported, including 70 on Thursday alone. Doctors estimate that over 25,000 people are currently infected, primarily due to consuming unclean water and spoiled food. Hospitals in Dhaka and other regions are overwhelmed, with many patients lying under trees or in makeshift tents awaiting treatment. Due to the persistent heatwave, the government has ordered schools in the northern high-temperature regions to close and advised people to avoid outdoor activities during midday. Government departments and factories have also shortened working hours.

Tornadoes and storms are also major disasters in Bangladesh. In the over 10 years since independence, there have been 35 recorded tornadoes, resulting in thousands of deaths, tens of thousands of injuries, and over 500,000 people left homeless. Last November's storm alone caused over a thousand deaths. On the night of April 26th, a tornado devastated over 50 villages, with 20 villages almost completely destroyed. Over 1,100 people died, countless were injured, and tens of thousands were left homeless. Just as the victims were beginning to recover, a storm hit the northwestern region of Bangladesh on May 13th. The wind speed reached 100 kilometers per hour, and nearly 200 millimeters of rain fell in just two hours. Two people died in the rain, over 5,000 houses were destroyed, and tens of thousands were left homeless.

In recent years, the government and people of Bangladesh have been fighting against natural disasters, with support from the international community. However, due to geographical, climatic, and historical reasons, the task of resisting natural disasters remains extremely arduous for the people of Bangladesh.

### 干旱　热浪　龙卷风　暴风雨  孟加拉国天灾频仍

　　干旱　热浪　龙卷风　暴风雨    
    孟加拉国天灾频仍
    本报记者  任毓骏
    开春以来，４０余年未见的旱灾笼罩着孟加拉国大地，至今未见缓解，而其间又有龙卷风、暴风雨和热浪不时袭击这个多灾多难的国家。
    孟加拉国的气候特点是非涝即旱，今年开春就遇到了数十年不见的大旱，从２月份至今仅降雨１２５毫米，不及正常雨量的１／４。孟加拉国中部产粮区土地龟裂，禾苗枯死，灌溉渠道断流，许多地区人和牲畜的饮水都发生严重困难。据官方估计，今年的小麦和稻米的产量很可能减产一半，而水果和蔬菜的受灾情况更为严重。
    由于持续不断的旱灾，导致今年热季的提前到来。和孟加拉国同纬度的巴基斯坦南部的温度在３５℃左右时，孟加拉国已热到４３℃。上周来，已有４０多人直接死于热浪。由于缺乏新鲜饮水，许多人患了传染性腹泻症，目前已有１１００多人死于此症，仅上星期四一天就死亡７０多人。医生估计，目前染上这种病的人数已超过２．５万人，主要原因是饮用不卫生的水和食用腐败食品。目前达卡以及其他地区的医院已经人满为患，许多人躺在树荫下或临时搭起的遮阳帐篷中等待治疗。由于热浪持续不退，政府已下令北部高温地区的学校停课，劝告人们不要在中午到户外行走，政府部门和厂矿企业都已缩短上班时间。
    龙卷风和暴风雨也是孟加拉国的一大灾难。自独立１０多年来，据统计已有３５场龙卷风袭击了孟加拉国，造成数千人死亡，数万人受伤，５０多万人无家可归。去年１１月的一场风灾造成千余人死亡，今年４月２６日晚间的一场龙卷风使５０多个村庄受灾，其中２０个村庄几乎被夷为平地，房屋全部被毁，死于这场灾难的有１１００余人，伤者无数，数十万人无家可归。就在这场灾难尚未让灾民们得到喘息之际，５月１３日一场暴风雨又袭击了孟加拉国西北部地区。当时风速高达每小时１００公里，两小时之内降雨近２００毫米，雨中有２人死亡，被毁的房屋达５０００多所，数万人无家可归。
    近年来，孟加拉国政府和人民一直在和自然灾害作斗争，同时得到国际社会多方援助。但由于地理、气候和历史原因，孟加拉国人民和天灾抗争的任务还极其艰巨。（本报伊斯兰堡５月１５日电）
