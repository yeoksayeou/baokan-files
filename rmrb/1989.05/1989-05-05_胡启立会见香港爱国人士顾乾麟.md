Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 5th. (Reporter Huang Riyao) Today, Hu Qili, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with Guo Qianlin, the founder of the Shuiping Scholarship and consultant to the board of directors of Jardine Matheson Hong Kong Limited.

Hu Qili highly praised Guo Qianlin's dedication to education and public welfare. He said, "Mr. Guo has followed his father's will to establish the Shuiping Scholarship, overcoming numerous difficulties over half a century, and has cultivated a large number of talents for China's construction."

The 80-year-old Mr. Guo Qianlin came to Beijing from Hong Kong to participate in the 50th anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Shuiping Scholarship. In 1939, he followed his father's teachings of "taking from society and using for society" and established the Shuiping Scholarship in Shanghai. From 1939 to 1949, more than 1,100 students received this scholarship and have since become important leaders, experts, professors, and engineers. In 1986, after moving to Hong Kong, Mr. Guo continued the Shuiping Scholarship in Shanghai, Beijing, and Huzhou, with 800 outstanding students having received the scholarship to date.

Due to Mr. Guo Qianlin's establishment of the Shuiping Scholarship in seven middle schools in Beijing, contributing to the development of the city's education, the Beijing Municipal Government recently appointed him as Beijing's first "Education Advisor."

　　胡启立会见香港爱国人士顾乾麟
    据新华社北京５月５日电  （记者黄日尧）中共中央政治局常委胡启立今天下午在北京会见了叔蘋奖学金创立者、香港怡和有限公司董事局顾问顾乾麟先生。
    胡启立在会见时高度赞扬了顾乾麟先生热心教育、热心公益事业的精神。他说，“顾先生继承先父顾叔蘋老先生的遗志建立奖学金，半个世纪风风雨雨，克服了重重困难，为中国的建设事业培养了大批人才。”
    ８０高龄的顾乾麟先生是从香港专程到北京参加叔蘋奖学金建立５０周年庆祝活动的。１９３９年他遵循先父“取诸社会，用诸社会”的遗训，在上海创办了叔蘋奖学金。１９３９年至１９４９年期间受到此项奖学金资助的１１００多名学生，现已成为重要的领导干部和专家、教授、工程师等。１９８６年，已移居香港的顾先生在上海、北京、湖州三市续办叔蘋奖学金，至今已有８００名品学兼优的学生获得了这项奖学金。
    由于顾乾麟先生在北京市７所中学设立了叔蘋奖学金，为首都教育事业的发展作出了贡献，北京市人民政府日前已聘请他为北京市第一位“教育顾问”。
