The Anhui Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology recently excavated a group of primitive tombs at the Neolithic site of Lingjiatan in Hanshan County, revealing a batch of rare pottery, jade, and stone artifacts. The newly discovered fifteen pit tombs are oriented north-south, with vertical pit graves. Approximately seven hundred artifacts, including pottery, stone tools, jade, agate, and quartz, were unearthed. The pottery is mostly tempered with sand, with thin bodies and low firing temperatures, diverse types, and unique shapes, primarily used for daily life. Some pottery items, such as the tripod-shaped pot with three flat feet, the tall-handled round-mouthed pot with a high neck, the high-rimmed perforated waist basin, and the chicken-shaped pot, were discovered for the first time in the country. Thermoluminescence dating indicates that these artifacts are approximately five thousand years old. The unearthed jade carvings, including jade human figures, jade turtles, jade original Bagua diagrams, jade tigers, jade buttons, and jade spoons, are also first-time discoveries in the country.

The three winning works, "White Dew," "Dream of Heaven," and "Moonrise in the Forest," along with ninety-seven outstanding works, will be exhibited in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Taipei starting from May 6. The "Contemporary Chinese Ink Painting Newcomer Award" competition is jointly organized by the Hong Kong Chinese Cultural Promotion Centre, Beijing Fine Arts Magazine, and Taipei Lion Art Monthly.

A novel titled "Wind and Rain: The Life of a Merchant," written by an individual entrepreneur about the life of individual entrepreneurs, has recently been published by Changjiang Literature and Art Publishing House. The author, Ren Chang, whose original name is Wang Renchang, is an ordinary individual entrepreneur on Hancheng Street in Wuhan.

A 50-centimeter-tall stone statue of Confucius, crafted by the Qufu Stone Carving Art Factory, will be sent to Japan in early May to spread Confucian teachings and build a bridge of friendship between China and Japan. This statue of Confucius is meticulously carved from high-quality white marble. It depicts Confucius with a cap and a wide sash, holding a ceremonial tablet, appearing lifelike.
