The Huabei Cement Factory in Huabei City transports coal from mines such as Baishan and Qianling, incurring over 10 different types of fees. If the factory uses its own trucks to transport coal, the Baishan Joint Transportation Station charges a transportation service fee of 0.6 yuan per ton of coal. Additionally, the Baishan Joint Transportation Station charges a transportation management fee of 0.4 yuan per ton of coal. The farmers of Sanli Well in Baishan Town charge a flatbed fee of 0.1 yuan per ton of coal for pushing the coal onto flatbeds. Sanli Well also charges a road management fee of 0.2 yuan per ton of coal for the vehicles transporting the coal. Local farmers charge a fee of 2 yuan per vehicle for supposedly guarding the coal trucks. The road maintenance fee is collected by the Qianling Joint Transportation Station, amounting to 0.4 yuan per ton of coal. The comprehensive public security management fee is jointly collected by the Qianling Joint Transportation Station and the local traffic department, charging 0.1 yuan per ton of coal. The Qianling Mine Labor Service Company's Marketing Department charges a weighing fee of 0.12 yuan per ton of coal. Although both the Huabei Cement Factory and the Qianling Mine in Baishan Town are under the jurisdiction of Huabei City, the City Coal Management Office still charges a transit fee of 5 yuan per ton of coal for off-plan coal transportation. Additionally, relevant departments also charge coal management fees and coal transportation handling fees.

A deputy director of the Huabei Cement Factory angrily remarked, "Our factory is less than 20 kilometers away from the Baishan coal mine, but due to the various fees mentioned above, the factory's annual production cost increases by over 330,000 yuan. These fee-collecting units all have the authority, and the enterprise cannot afford to provoke them."

　　淮北水泥厂副厂长感叹    
    惹不起的乱收费
    淮北市水泥厂到白善、前岭等煤矿运煤，要付１０多种费用：用本厂的车运煤，白善联运站每吨煤要收取联运服务费０．６元。同时，白善联运站每吨煤还要收取运输管理费０．４元。白善镇三里井的农民以推平车上煤为名，每吨煤收平车费０．１元。三里井还向运煤车辆收公路管理费，每吨煤收０．２元。当地农民以帮助看管车辆为名，向每辆运煤车收费２元。修路费由前岭联运站收，每吨煤收０．４元。综合治安管理费由前岭联运站和当地交通部门联合收取，每吨煤收费０．１元。前岭矿劳动服务公司运销科收取过磅费，每吨煤收０．１２元。淮北市水泥厂与白善镇前岭矿同属淮北市管辖，但市煤炭管理办公室还是要对计划外煤炭运输收过境费，每吨煤收取５元。此外，有关部门还要收取煤管费和运煤手续费。
    淮北市水泥厂一位副厂长气愤地说：“我厂离白善煤矿不足２０公里，由于上述各种费用开支，使厂里每年生产成本增加３３万多元。这些收费单位都有权，企业惹不起。”
