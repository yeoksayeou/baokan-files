The five flavors—spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, and salty—each have unique effects on human health. They nourish the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys respectively, and together they nourish the blood and vital energy.

Spicy: It can eliminate symptoms such as stagnation of qi and blood in the body. However, spicy food has a strong stimulating effect. If consumed in excess, it can cause excessive lung qi, rectal burning, and other symptoms. Therefore, those with hemorrhoids, other anal diseases, stomach and duodenal ulcers, constipation, urethritis, and pharyngitis should avoid eating too much spicy food.

Sour: Consuming sour food can enhance liver function and prevent certain liver diseases. However, eating too much sour food can disrupt digestion. Those with excessive stomach acid, arthritis, and poor kidney function should avoid eating too much sour food.

Bitter: It has the effects of clearing heat and promoting urination. However, those with spleen deficiency or constipation should eat less bitter food, as it can cause nausea, vomiting, and other ailments.

Sweet: Eating sweet food regularly can nourish the qi and blood, relieve muscle tension, and has a detoxifying effect. However, consuming too much sweet food can lead to increased blood sugar and cholesterol levels, making the body weak and overweight. Therefore, overweight individuals should generally eat less sweet food, and diabetics should avoid it altogether.

Salty: It is an essential component of blood and sweat in the body. Consuming it can soften acidic lumps in the body. However, eating too much salt can increase the burden on the heart and kidneys and worsen symptoms of hypertension.

　　五味的功过
    辣、酸、苦、甜、咸等五种味道对人体的健康具有独特的作用：分别补养心、肝、脾、肺、肾五脏，综合而补养血气。
    辣　可消除体内气滞、血滞等症。但辣味有较强的刺激性，如食过量，会使肺气过盛、肛门灼热。所以患痔疮等肛门疾病及胃、十二指溃疡、便秘、尿道炎、咽喉炎等症者，不宜多食。
    酸　食之可增强肝脏的功能，防止某些肝脏疾病。但食酸过多，会引起消化功能紊乱。尤其是胃酸过多的人，患关节炎及肾功能差者切勿多吃酸。
    苦　有除燥热和利尿等作用，但脾虚或大便秘结的人应少吃，多吃会引起恶心、呕吐，或发生其它疾患。
    甜　常吃能补气血，解除肌肉紧张，还有解毒作用。但甜食过多，会导致血糖升高、血液中胆固醇增加，使身体虚胖。因此肥胖者一般应少吃甜，糖尿病患者更不能食。
    咸　它是人体血汗中不可缺少的成份，食它能软化体内酸性的肿块。但食量过分，会加重心、肾机能的负担，加重高血压等症状。
