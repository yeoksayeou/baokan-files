It is well known that frequent changes in government have been a prominent feature of Italian politics since the war. From the first post-war republic government in 1947 to the present, there have been 47 governments (a total of 49 governments since the war), with an average lifespan of 314 days for each government.

To date, only the first Craxi government lasted 1058 days and the Moro government lasted 833 days, both exceeding two years. The shortest-lived government was the last Fanfani government, which lasted only two days, and the fifth Andreotti government lasted only 9 days. Additionally, 14 governments lasted over one year.

Among the 47 governments, 14 different forms of coalition have been adopted.

The average duration of government crises to date has been 32 days per crisis. The longest government crisis lasted 126 days, and the shortest lasted 7 days.

The current Demita government, which has resigned, was formed after a 34-day crisis and lasted for 402 days.

    在４７届政府中，采取了１４种不同的联合形式。
    至今的政府危机时间平均为每次３２天。最长的政府危机１２６天，最短的政府危机７天。
    现在辞职的德米塔政府是在３４天危机后组成的，寿命为４０２天。
