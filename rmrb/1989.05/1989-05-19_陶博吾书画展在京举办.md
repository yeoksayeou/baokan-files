The calligraphy and painting exhibition of the renowned calligrapher, painter, poet, and scholar Tao Bowa, who is 90 years old, opened on the morning of May 16 at the China Art Museum.

Mr. Tao, whose given name is Wen, and whose pen name is Baihu Scatterer, hails from Pengze, Jiangxi. From 1925 to 1930, he studied at the Nanjing Art Academy and the Shanghai Changming Art Academy, learning from masters such as Huang Binhong, Pan Tianshou, Wang Yiting, and Cao Zhaocao. He was deeply influenced by Mr. Wu Changshuo, particularly his calligraphy, especially the Stone Drums, and once compiled the remaining characters of the Stone Drums into 98 couplets. Mr. Tao is a man of profound learning, with deep insights into poetry, calligraphy, painting, and philology. This exhibition features 129 works, including 59 calligraphic pieces and 69 paintings. Calligraphers unanimously agree that Mr. Tao's works are profound and vast, robust and ancient, with intricate forms and rich inner content. Moreover, he is a man of high moral character, indifferent to fame and wealth, clear in his likes and dislikes, broad-minded, and upright.

Mr. Tao's calligraphy and paintings will also be exhibited in Japan and Taiwan by invitation.

　　陶博吾书画展在京举办
    本报讯  记者高新庆报道：著名书法家、国画家、诗人、学者，９０高龄的陶博吾先生书画展，５月１６日上午在中国美术馆开幕。
    陶先生名文，号白湖散人，江西彭泽人。先生１９２５年至１９３０年先后入南京美专、上海昌明艺专学习，师从黄宾虹、潘天寿、王一亭、曹拙巢等，受吴昌硕先生影响很深，喜吴翁书法，特别是石鼓文，曾将石鼓文遗留残字集成楹联９８幅。陶老学识渊博，诗、书、画及文字学造诣精深。这次书画展共展出作品１２９幅，其中书作５９幅，画作６９幅，书法家们一致认为陶老作品沉雄博大、苍劲古朴，外形奇巧而内涵丰富，且人品高洁，淡泊名利，爱憎分明，虚怀大度，刚正不阿。
    陶先生书画，还将应邀赴日本、台湾展出。
