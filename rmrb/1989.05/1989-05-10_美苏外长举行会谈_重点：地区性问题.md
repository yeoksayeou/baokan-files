U.S. and Soviet Foreign Ministers Hold Talks

Focus: Regional Issues

MOSCOW, May 10 (Xinhua) — U.S. Secretary of State Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze held their first round of talks here today, focusing on regional issues.

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Grjasimov revealed at a news conference that the two sides had exchanged views on U.S. Defense Secretary Cheney's remarks about Soviet reforms and U.S. President Bush's visit to Poland and Hungary. The U.S. side said Cheney was expressing personal views. Grjasimov sarcastically remarked that Cheney needs money, and without emphasizing the Soviet threat, it would be impossible to increase U.S. military spending.

Grjasimov said that Gorbachev's visit to Britain and his upcoming visits to the Federal Republic of Germany and France, as well as Bush's upcoming visits to Poland and Hungary, are all conducive to the construction of the "European House." He believed that a divided Europe was a "great mistake" made by past leaders.

The Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said that in today's first round of talks, at the initiative of the U.S. side, the focus was on regional conflicts. The Soviet Union believes that the U.S. stance on Central America has new content, abandoning the attempt to overthrow the current government of Nicaragua, which is conducive to a political solution. Baker and Shevardnadze also exchanged views on the Afghan issue. Baker emphasized that the Afghan resistance forces do not recognize the Najibullah regime. Grjasimov said that there are differences between the Soviet Union and the United States on the issue of forming a joint government.

It is understood that the much-anticipated high-level Soviet-U.S. meeting and the resumption of strategic arms reduction talks were not discussed today. Grjasimov said that the Soviet side has been ready to resume strategic arms reduction talks for a long time.

Soviet leader Gorbachev will meet with Baker tomorrow.

　　美苏外长举行会谈    
    重点：地区性问题
    新华社莫斯科５月１０日电（记者唐修哲）美国国务卿贝克和苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在这里举行了首轮会谈，着重就地区问题交换了意见。
    苏联外交部发言人格拉西莫夫在新闻发布会上还披露，苏美双方曾就美国国防部长切尼关于苏联改革的言论和美国总统布什访问波兰和匈牙利一事交换了意见。美方认为切尼表达的是个人意见。格拉西莫夫挖苦地说，切尼需要钱，如果不强调苏联威胁，就不可能增加美国的军费。
    格拉西莫夫说，戈尔巴乔夫访问英国和即将对联邦德国和法国的访问，以及布什即将对波兰和匈牙利的访问都有利于建设“欧洲大厦”。他认为，分裂的欧洲是过去的领导人犯下的一个“巨大错误”。
    苏联外交部发言人说，在今天的首轮会谈中，根据美方的倡议着重讨论了地区冲突。苏联认为，美国的中美洲立场有新的内容，抛弃了推翻尼加拉瓜现政权的企图，这有利于转向政治解决。贝克和谢瓦尔德纳泽还就阿富汗问题交换了意见。贝克强调，阿富汗抵抗力量不承认纳吉布拉政权。格拉西莫夫说，苏美在成立联合政府问题上存在着分歧。
    据悉，人们关心的苏美高级会晤和恢复削减战略武器谈判的问题，今天双方未曾讨论。格拉西莫夫说，苏方早就准备恢复削减战略武器的谈判。
    苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫明天将会见贝克。
