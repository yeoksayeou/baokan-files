	Representing the Standing Committee of the Politburo,
	Zhao Ziyang Issues Written Statement
	Affirms Broad Student Patriotic Enthusiasm, Will Not "Settle Scores Later"
	Hopes Students Take Care of Health, Stop Hunger Strike, and Quickly Recover

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 17 — Zhao Ziyang, on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Politburo members Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, and Yao Yilin, issued a written statement (May 17, 1989, early morning)
	Students:

	Now, I represent the Standing Committee of the Politburo members Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Hu Qili, and Yao Yilin to say a few words to you students.

	Students' demands for democracy and the rule of law, opposition to corruption, and promotion of reform are very precious patriotic enthusiasm. The Party Central Committee and the State Council affirm this. At the same time, we hope that students can remain calm, rational, restrained, and orderly, consider the overall situation, and maintain a stable and united atmosphere.

	Please rest assured, the Party and the government will absolutely not "settle scores later."

	I also want to tell students that the Central Committee attaches great importance to the reasonable opinions and demands raised by everyone. We will further study the opinions and demands of students and various sectors of society, and propose and take practical measures to strengthen the construction of democracy and the rule of law, oppose corruption, promote clean governance, and increase transparency.

	Students, the responsibility of building modernization and revitalizing China ultimately falls on the shoulders of the younger generation. You still have a long time to contribute to the country and the nation. The Central Committee hopes that students will take care of their health, stop the hunger strike, and quickly recover. This way, the Central Committee will be at ease, and your parents, teachers, and the broad masses will also be at ease. After students return, comrades from the Central Committee and the State Council will continue to listen to students' opinions, and multi-level and multi-channel dialogues with various parties will continue to be carried out in depth.

	I once again appeal to students, stop the hunger strike. I wish students a quick recovery of health.

    新华社北京５月１７日电　赵紫阳同志代表中央政治局常委发表书面谈话
    （一九八九年五月十七日凌晨）同学们：
    现在，我代表中央政治局常委李鹏、乔石、胡启立、姚依林同志，向同学们讲几句话。
    同学们要求民主和法制、反对腐败、推进改革的爱国热情是非常可贵的，党中央和国务院是肯定的，同时也希望同学们能够保持冷静、理智、克制、秩序，顾全大局，维护安定团结的局面。
    请同学们放心，党和政府绝不会“秋后算帐”。
    我还要告诉同学们，中央对大家提出的合理意见和要求非常重视。我们将进一步研究同学们和社会各界的意见和要求，提出和采取加强民主和法制建设，反对腐败，推进廉政建设，增加透明度等实际措施。
    同学们，建设四化，振兴中华的担子最终要落在青年一代身上。你们为国家和民族做贡献的时间还很长。中央希望同学们保重身体，停止绝食，尽快恢复健康。这样，中央就放心了，你们的父母、教师和广大群众也就放心了。同学们回去以后，中央和国务院的同志还会继续听取同学们的意见，同各方面多层次多渠道的座谈对话都将深入进行下去。
    我再次呼吁同学们，停止绝食。祝愿同学们尽快恢复健康。
