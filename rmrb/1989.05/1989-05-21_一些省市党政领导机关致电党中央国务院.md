Some provincial and municipal party and government leaders have sent telegrams to the Party Central Committee and the State Council. The Xinhua News Agency reported on May 21 from Beijing that the party and government leaders of Shanghai, Shaanxi, Hunan, Hebei, Henan, and Fujian have studied the speeches given by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They have also sent telegrams to the Party Central Committee and the State Council expressing their firm support for the measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to quickly restore order in the capital.

The telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee to the Party Central Committee:

The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee's standing committee members watched the live broadcast of the Central Committee's conference for party, government, and military cadres with great enthusiasm. They listened to the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. The standing committee members unanimously expressed their firm support for the report and opinions presented by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Political Bureau Standing Committee. The standing committee immediately convened a meeting with the main party and government leaders of key universities, as well as the heads of the public security and health departments, to deploy relevant work. Subsequently, Comrades Jiang Zemin, Zhu Rongji, and other party and government leaders went to the site of the student sit-in and hunger strike to persuade them to stop the hunger strike and accept treatment.

The Municipal Party Committee is determined to unite even more closely around the Party Central Committee. It calls on all Communist Party members and the people of Shanghai to resolutely implement the decisions of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee, and strive to maintain social stability and economic stability. It also calls for upholding the four cardinal principles and continuing with reform and opening up!

The telegram from the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government to the Party Central Committee and the State Council:

This morning at 8:30, we urgently convened an expanded meeting of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee to review the videotape of the Central Committee and State Council's conference for the capital's party, government, and military cadres held last night. We conducted a serious study and discussion. The attendees unanimously expressed their firm support for the wise decision made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil, and their firm support for the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun.

The situation in the Xi'an area shows that the turmoil that has occurred nationwide in recent periods is, in essence, a denial of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. It is a serious political struggle. If allowed to develop, it could allow a few people's plots to succeed, turning a hopeful China into a chaotic and hopeless China. This is something that the entire Party and the people of the nation cannot allow. The decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council represent the fundamental interests of the people of the nation and will certainly receive the support and approval of the broad masses.

The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have made arrangements and deployments to study and implement the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. All party members and the broad masses of the people are determined, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, to unite as one, take immediate action, resolutely oppose the turmoil, stop the turmoil, guard their posts, work hard, stabilize the situation in Shaanxi, and push forward the reform and construction of our province. We will make our own contributions to achieving complete victory in this struggle.

The telegram from the Hunan Provincial Party Committee to the Party Central Committee:

After the Central Television broadcast of Comrade Li Peng's important speech on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference early in the morning of May 20, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee immediately organized a study and discussion among the standing committee members who were in the province. Everyone unanimously expressed their firm support for Comrade Li Peng's important speech, Comrade Yang Shangkun's speech, and the major decisions and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee. Everyone believes that the current turmoil must not be allowed to develop further, and this serious situation must not be allowed to continue. Comrade Li Peng's important speech and the measures taken by the Central Committee are timely and important, serving as powerful weapons to resolve the current turmoil. All levels of party committees, governments, and the broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the province must resolutely and unshakably implement and execute them.

In recent days, large-scale demonstrations and parades have occurred in places like Changsha in our province, affecting the normal operation of some agencies and parts of enterprises and public institutions, bringing many difficulties and problems to economic work and social security, and causing serious confusion among the people. To maintain stability in Hunan, we have taken some measures. (1) Strengthen leadership, actively do good work, and stabilize the situation. All levels of leadership teams must withstand the test and remain unshakably consistent with the Party Central Committee. At the same time, we must actively do good work to stabilize the situation in our regions, units, and departments. We must continue to stabilize schools, factories, agencies, and rural areas. Through painstaking and meticulous work, we must do everything possible to ease various social contradictions. (2) All levels of leadership teams should divide their work and form two teams to effectively handle the work of stabilizing the social situation and economic production. The Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have established two teams, one to handle the work of stabilizing the social situation and the other to handle production command. We require the stabilization of industrial production and the increase of effective supply. We must especially focus on current agricultural production to ensure a good harvest this year. Universities must do good work, requiring students not to engage in parade activities, and the principals must mobilize students to return to class. At the same time, we must do the ideological work of students on hunger strike and urge them to stop the hunger strike and return to school immediately. (3) Ensure the normal operation of urban service departments. The supply of electricity, water, gas, and public transportation in the city must be normal. All localities must properly arrange the market to ensure the supply of grain, oil, and other food and daily necessities for the people, doing everything possible to meet the normal needs of urban residents. (4) Effectively maintain social order and traffic order. Require the public security departments to strengthen control over the social surface, prevent the occurrence of serious incidents, and take decisive measures against those who engage in looting, arson, and other criminal activities, punishing them according to law.

The telegram from the Hebei Provincial Party Committee:

On the morning of May 20, the responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Military Region, and other departments held a joint meeting to seriously study and discuss the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They also conveyed the situation in Beijing as introduced by Comrade Li Ximing. Comrade Yong Congzhi, the Provincial Party Committee Secretary, presided over the meeting.

The attendees unanimously expressed their firm support for the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun and the various decisions and measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to quickly stop the turmoil in the capital. Everyone believes that the current turmoil has already had a detrimental impact on our politics, economy, and foreign relations. If the situation is not quickly reversed, it will have unimaginable consequences. At this critical moment, when the fate and future of the Party and the country are at stake, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have taken decisive measures and called on the entire Party, the military, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country to mobilize urgently to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation. This is extremely timely and correct. It fully proves that our Party is strong, has combat effectiveness, and is resolute in representing and safeguarding the interests of the state and the people. Everyone expressed that they would definitely implement the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, immediately mobilize the broad masses of party members and the people of the province to take urgent action, and quickly join the struggle to stop the turmoil. They will strive to stabilize the situation, consolidate the political situation of stability and unity, and ensure the smooth progress of construction and reform.

To effectively implement the Central Committee's instructions in Hebei, the meeting decided:

(1) Immediately organize party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at all levels, to concentrate time and energy to seriously study the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, especially Comrade Li Peng, to understand the situation, unify thinking, raise awareness, strengthen confidence, and actively join the struggle to stop the turmoil. In terms of ideology and politics, we must firmly maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee and consciously safeguard the leadership authority of the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

(2) All levels of party and government leaders must quickly take effective measures to more broadly and deeply do good work in stabilizing the situation. All localities, departments, and units, especially universities, must make specific arrangements according to the Central Committee's instructions and establish a strict responsibility system to ensure that all work is implemented item by item. We must fully recognize the arduousness and long-term nature of unifying thinking and stabilizing the situation, and do the work thoroughly and meticulously. We must not be complacent just because the Central Committee has taken decisive measures and think that the work that should be done well can be neglected. We must further do a good job of extensive dialogues with students, workers, cadres, and people from all walks of life, conduct education and guidance, lead everyone to maintain the overall situation, guard their posts, observe discipline, and do a good job in the construction and reform of various tasks. This is the best and most practical action to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation.

(3) According to the established policies and guidelines of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, we must further focus on doing a good job in rectification and regulation, improving democracy and the legal system, rectifying corruption, and investigating and punishing officials who have fallen. We must strive to do better than before to provide the necessary guarantees and conditions for fundamentally stabilizing people's thoughts and social order.

(4) Quickly and in a layered manner, implement the Central Committee's instructions. This afternoon, the Provincial Party Committee will convene a meeting of responsible cadres from various democratic parties, non-partisan individuals, and mass organizations. Tomorrow morning, a meeting of provincial-level department heads will be convened to first unify understanding and make arrangements at the leadership level of provincial-level agencies and various social organizations. At the same time, the party organizations of various grassroots units must organize the study of party members and cadres and the broad masses. All localities, cities, and counties must quickly do a good job in organizing study and discussion, formulating measures, and other aspects of work.

The meeting believes that to truly stop this turmoil, a large amount of painstaking and meticulous work needs to be done. Therefore, it is required that all levels of leading cadres must be full of confidence and fully estimate the arduousness of the work. No matter what the situation is, they must always maintain a vigorous revolutionary spirit and work enthusiasm, do the work tightly, and strive for results to ensure the implementation of the Central Committee's instructions in Hebei.

The telegram from the Henan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government to the Party Central Committee and the State Council:

On the night of May 19, after watching the important speech by Comrade Li Peng at the capital's party, government, and military cadres conference broadcast by the Central Television, we immediately organized the main responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Military Region to seriously study and discuss. Everyone unanimously believes that the important speech and requirements made by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council are major measures to quickly stop the spreading turmoil and maintain the stability of the capital and the country. They are wise decisions to defend the four cardinal principles and the achievements of ten years of reform, fully reflecting the wishes of the entire Party, the military, and the people of the nation. Comrades unanimously expressed their firm support for the wise decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, their unshakable consistency with the Party Central Committee in politics, and their clear stance in stopping the turmoil. They will make contributions to maintaining the political situation of stability and unity.

On the morning of May 20, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government issued a notice to all localities in the province, requiring all levels of party organizations, governments, and all Communist Party members, state agency workers, public security police, and armed police, all industrial and commercial enterprises and public institutions, all levels and types of schools, and all the people of the province to seriously study and resolutely implement Comrade Li Peng's important speech. They must fully recognize the seriousness of this turmoil and the essence of the struggle, take immediate action, and make their due contributions to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation in their respective positions.

To implement the spirit of Comrade Li Peng's important speech, the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of responsible comrades from various provincial-level units on the morning of May 20. Comrade Yang Xiezong, based on the situation in Henan over the past few days, put forward four requirements for the provincial-level agencies: (1) Starting today, all units must organize all personnel to seriously study and discuss Comrade Li Peng's important speech, unifying everyone's thinking and understanding with the spirit of the speech. (2) All party members, cadres, and workers in each unit must guard their posts, fulfill their duties, work hard, ensure the completion of production and various tasks, and maintain the situation of stability and unity with practical actions. (3) All Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and workers in the provincial-level agencies must strictly observe party discipline, government discipline, league discipline, and legal discipline, and do not participate in, support, or cheer on parades and demonstrations. They must not spread or believe in rumors. Not only must they lead by example, but they must also persuade their relatives, children, and friends to do the same. (4) In view of the current complex situation, the leading comrades of each unit must not be complacent and must continue to be vigilant, prevent and resolutely stop the turmoil, and do a good job in the safety prevention of key departments and leadership agencies.

In the afternoon of May 20, the Provincial Party Committee invited responsible comrades from various democratic parties in the province and non-party individuals to study Comrade Li Peng's important speech. Everyone expressed their firm support for the Party Central Committee's decisions and united as one to contribute to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation.

The above situation is only preliminary. After further study and implementation in all localities in the province, a separate report will be made.

The telegram from the Fujian Provincial Party Committee to the Central Committee:

After the broadcast of the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the capital's party, government, and military cadres conference, Comrade Chen Guangyi, the Provincial Party Committee Secretary, immediately presided over a meeting of responsible comrades from relevant provincial-level departments. Comrade Jia Qinglin, the Provincial Party Committee Deputy Secretary, reported on the recent situation of the student movement in the province and arranged for various localities and departments to quickly organize the study and implementation of the speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. Subsequently, a meeting of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee was convened, with responsible comrades from the Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission attending. The meeting focused on the study and discussion of the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. At the same time, it conveyed the report by Comrade Li Ximing on the situation of the student movement in Beijing, listened to and watched the order issued by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the State Council regarding the imposition of martial law in some areas of Beijing, and the first, second, and third orders of the Beijing Municipal Government.

Everyone believes that the speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun are very important and timely. They correctly analyze the current situation, emphasize the seriousness of this struggle, and put forward specific opinions on resolutely stopping the turmoil and quickly restoring order. They have important guiding significance for maintaining stability and unity and ensuring the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction. The attendees unanimously expressed their firm support for the wise and decisive decisions made by the Political Bureau Standing Committee and their high consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideology and politics.

Comrades recognize that the turmoil currently being created by a few people is, in essence, a denial of the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. In recent days, various localities in our province have also seen large-scale student movements supporting the Beijing student movement, with tens of thousands of students from dozens of colleges and universities participating in class boycotts and parades. Although the vast majority of students have good intentions, expressing their patriotic enthusiasm for promoting democracy and rectifying corruption, some reactionary slogans and banners and serious disruptions to traffic order have appeared. The above-mentioned situations indicate that a serious political struggle is facing the entire Party and the people of the nation. If this turmoil is not quickly stopped and allowed to spread, the great achievements of ten years of reform will be lost, and a China with great hope and prospects will face unimaginable consequences.

Comrades also pointed out that the measures taken by the Central Committee for the current situation are both decisive and appropriate. On the one hand, they clearly oppose the turmoil and expose the political plots of a few people. On the other hand, they insist on protecting the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students and strictly distinguish them from the few people who create the turmoil. Correctly grasping this leadership art and work policy will help us quickly stop the turmoil, properly handle various contradictions, and stabilize the current situation.

Many comrades pointed out that the occurrence and development of this incident, to a certain extent, show that our ideological and political work indeed has weak links, fully demonstrating the correctness of Comrade Xiaoping's repeated emphasis on the "two-handed" policy. We must, while promoting reform and various constructions, not relax our work in the ideological and political fields, accelerate the construction of democracy and the legal system, and steadily and actively promote political system reform.

Based on the study and discussion, comrades proposed the following opinions for implementation:

(1) Quickly unify the thoughts of the broad masses of cadres, the masses, and young students with the spirit of the Central Committee. All levels of party committees and governments must quickly organize the broad masses of cadres, the masses, young students, and public security police to seriously study the speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the capital's party, government, and military cadres conference, study the order of the State Council regarding the imposition of martial law in some areas of Beijing, and re-study the editorial of the People's Daily on April 26. They must fully recognize the great significance of resolutely stopping social turmoil, overcome various vague thoughts, and maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideology and politics. They must clearly oppose the turmoil and resolutely maintain the political situation of stability and unity.

(2) Take effective measures to resolutely stop the turmoil. After the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun were issued, today there were no students parading on the streets in our province, but some students' thoughts and emotions have not been resolved. We must pay close attention to social trends and take decisive measures. Students must immediately stop all parade activities; those who have stopped classes must immediately and unconditionally return to class, and schools must strictly enforce school rules and regulations. Various sectors of society must not engage in any "support" activities. No one is allowed to engage in any form of linking up. Those who create rumors, incite trouble, engage in looting, arson, and obstruct traffic must be resolutely punished according to law. Public security and armed police troops must maintain vigilance, deploy forces, and take further safety precautions for party and government leadership agencies, key departments, and traffic arteries. They must strictly prohibit the forcible interception and boarding of trains and vehicles, strictly prohibit the blocking and storming of stations, docks, roads, bridges, and airports, and ensure the normal order of production, work, and life.

(3) Do good ideological and political work to further stabilize people's minds. All levels and departments must, based on the serious problems and erroneous views exposed in this student movement, conduct targeted education and guidance. Especially in colleges and universities, they must combine the elimination of some students' dissatisfaction with patience and meticulous ideological work. Agencies, enterprises, and neighborhoods must also conduct positive education based on their respective situations to eliminate the impact of the student movement. All levels of leadership must continue to actively dialogue with students and people from all walks of life through various channels, seriously study and adopt their reasonable opinions and suggestions, and resolutely punish corrupt officials to eliminate various corrupt phenomena.

(4) Insist on "two-handed" work and strive to do a good job in production. All levels and departments must insist on one hand stabilizing society and the other hand promoting industrial and agricultural production, continuing with reform and opening up, and continuing to vigorously develop export-oriented economies. They must resolutely complete the economic tasks for the first half of the year. The broad masses of cadres and the people must guard their posts, fulfill their duties, maintain the normal order of work, and promote the cause of socialist construction.

    陕西省委、省政府，已经对学习贯彻党中央、国务院的决策，作出了安排部署。全省党员和广大人民，决心在党中央、国务院的领导下，和衷共济，团结一致，立即行动起来，坚决反对动乱，制止动乱，坚守岗位，努力工作，稳定陕西形势，把我省改革和建设推向前进，为夺取这场斗争的全胜做出自己的贡献。

        福建省委的电报中央：
    李鹏、杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话播放后，今天上午，省委书记陈光毅同志立即主持召集省直有关部门负责人会议，由省委副书记贾庆林同志通报了近日来省内学潮的情况，安排通知各地、各部门迅速组织认真学习贯彻李鹏、杨尚昆同志的讲话。随后召开了省委常委会议，省顾委、省人大、省政府、省政协、省纪委负责同志列席，会议着重学习讨论了李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话。同时传达了李锡铭同志关于北京学潮情况的通报，收听收看了李鹏同志签发的国务院关于北京部分地区的戒严令以及北京市政府的一、二、三号通令。
    大家认为，李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的讲话非常重要、非常及时。它实事求是地正确分析了当前局势，强调了这场斗争的严重性，提出了坚决制止动乱、迅速恢复秩序的具体意见，对维护安定团结，保证改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行，具有重要的指导意义。与会同志一致表示，坚决拥护中央政治局常委会作出的英明、果断的决策，坚决与党中央保持思想上政治上的高度一致。
    同志们认识到，当前极少数人蓄意制造的这场动乱，其实质是否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。近日来，我省各地也出现了有几十所大中专学校、数万名学生参加的声援北京学潮的罢课、游行活动。虽然绝大多数同学的主观愿望是善良的，表达了促进民主、整治腐败的爱国热情，但出现了一些反动标语口号和破坏交通秩序等严重情况。上述这些表明，摆在全党和全国人民面前的是一场严肃的政治斗争。对这场动乱如不迅速加以制止，任其蔓延，十年改革的巨大成果就会丧失殆尽，一个很有希望很有前途的中国，就会出现不堪设想的后果。
    大家还谈到，中央对当前局势采取的措施，既坚决果断，又适度得当。一方面旗帜鲜明地制止动乱，揭露极少数人的政治阴谋，一方面坚持保护广大青年学生的爱国热情，把他们同制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来。正确地掌握这种领导艺术和工作方针，有助于我们迅速制止动乱，妥善处理各类矛盾，稳定当前局势。
    许多同志指出，这次事态的发生发展，从一个方面说明了我们的思想政治工作确实存在着薄弱环节，充分表明小平同志反复强调的“两手抓”方针的正确。我们必须在推进改革和各项建设的同时，毫不放松思想政治领域的工作，加快民主、法制建设，稳妥、积极地推进政治体制改革。
    在学习讨论的基础上，大家提出了以下几点贯彻意见：
    一、尽快用中央的精神统一广大干部、群众和青年学生的思想。各级党委、政府要迅速组织广大干部、群众，青年学生和公安干警，认真学习李鹏、杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话，学习国务院关于在北京市部分地区实行戒严的命令，重新学习《人民日报》4月26日社论，充分认识坚决制止社会动乱的重大意义，克服各种模糊思想，在思想上政治上与党中央保持高度的一致，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，坚决维护安定团结的政治局面。
    二、采取有力措施，坚决制止动乱。李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话发表后，今天我省没有学生上街游行，但有一部分学生思想对立情绪尚未解决。我们必须密切注意社会动向，并采取果断措施，学生必须立即停止一切游行活动；凡停课的，必须立即无条件地复课，学校要严格校纪校规。社会各界不要再搞任何的“声援”活动。任何人不准以各种形式搞串联。对那些制造谣言、蛊惑人心、煽动闹事，搞打、砸、抢、烧，阻断交通的极少数人，要坚决依法惩处。公安和武警指战员要保持警惕、部署警力，对党政首脑机关、要害部门和交通要道，要进一步采取安全防范措施。严禁强行拦截和登乘列车、汽车，严禁堵塞、冲击车站、码头、公路、桥梁和机场，确保正常的生产、工作和生活秩序。
    三、做好思想政治工作，进一步稳定人心。各级、各部门要针对这次学潮中暴露出来的一些严重问题和错误观点，有的放矢地进行疏导、教育。特别是大中专学校要结合消除某些学生的不满情绪，做好耐心、细致的思想工作。机关、企业和街道也要根据各自情况，进行正面教育，消除学潮的影响。各级领导要继续通过各种渠道，主动地与学生和各界人士对话，认真研究和采纳他们的合理意见和建议，切实解决实质性的问题，进一步惩治官倒，消除各种腐败现象。
    四、坚持“两手抓”，努力搞好生产。各级、各部门要坚持一手抓社会的稳定，一手抓工农业生产，坚持改革开放，继续大力发展外向型经济，坚决完成上半年各项经济任务。广大干部、群众要坚守岗位，忠于职守，维护正常的工作秩序，把社会主义各项建设事业推向前进。
