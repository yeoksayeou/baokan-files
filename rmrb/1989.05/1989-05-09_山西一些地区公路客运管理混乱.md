Recently, I visited relatives in the Lvliang region of Shanxi and personally experienced the inconvenience caused to passengers by the chaotic management of public road passenger transport.

Vehicle scheduling is chaotic. On the morning of February 19, I got off the train at the Jiexiu Railway Station and 10 minutes later arrived at the Jiexiu Bus Station. I first checked the schedule posted inside the station: "Jiexiu to Linxian: 6:10 AM departure." However, it was not until 6:30 AM that the staff came to work. When buying a ticket, the ticket seller said, "There is no bus to Linxian." When asked why, the response was, "It has been suspended for two years." With no other option, I had to change my plan and go to Lishi County to transfer. Unexpectedly, a journey that should have taken half a day ended up taking a whole day. On February 24 and 25, I sent a friend from Sanjiao Town in Linxian to Jiexiu, but on both days, I did not see the scheduled bus pass through on time. On March 1, my friend and I took a bus from Sanjiao Town to Taiyuan. We boarded the bus at 6:20 AM, but it was driven in the opposite direction towards Linxian County. It was not until 8:20 AM that we returned to Sanjiao Town, wasting 2 hours and covering an additional 30 kilometers round trip. Originally, we could have arrived in Taiyuan by noon, but we did not arrive until 5 PM.

Ticket prices are chaotic. The fare from Fenyang to Lishi is 3 yuan, but the ticket I bought was for 4.5 yuan. When asked the ticket seller about the additional charge, he replied, "An additional 50% empty car fee of 1.5 yuan." When asked why the additional fee was charged, the response was, "This is a regulation of the Fenyang Automobile Transport Company." From Lishi to Sanjiao Town, the bus fare is 1.2 yuan, but several buses I waited for charged 3 yuan. Later, I found a bus that charged 2.5 yuan. Seeing that it was getting late, I had no choice but to board, otherwise, I would not have arrived by nightfall.

Vehicle maintenance is poor. On March 1, we finally managed to board a bus from Linxian to Taiyuan. However, when the bus reached the outskirts of Taiyuan, near Maopu Village in Qingxu County, it broke down. The driver got off and tapped the vehicle a few times, saying, "The car is broken and cannot go any further. You all get off and take the city bus into the city!" With no other choice, the passengers had to spend an additional 0.8 yuan to take the city bus into the city. Fortunately, the long-distance bus broke down at the outskirts of Taiyuan, where there were city buses available. If it had broken down in the middle of the journey, not at the outskirts of Taiyuan, I would not have been able to reach Taiyuan that day.

### 山西一些地区公路客运管理混乱

　　山西一些地区公路客运管理混乱
    最近，我到山西吕梁地区看望亲友，亲身体会到公路客运管理工作混乱给旅客带来许多不便。
    车辆调度乱。２月１９日晨５点，我从山西介休火车站下车，１０分钟后赶到介休汽车站，先看站内张贴的车次时刻表：“介休——临县：６点１０分开车”，但等到６点半才有工作人员上班，买票时售票员却说：“到临县没车。”问其原由，回答是：“停开两年了。”无法，我只好改去离石县再换车。谁料到，半天的路程竟走了一整天。２月２４日和２５日，我在临县三交镇送友人去介休，两天均未见到班车按时通过。３月１日，我同朋友从三交镇乘汽车到太原，６点２０分上车后却被拉向相反方向的临县县城，８点２０分才返回三交镇，浪费了２小时，往返又多坐了３０多公里，本来中午１２点可到太原，结果下午５点才到。
    车票价格乱。从汾阳到离石，票价３元，但旅客买的票却是４．５元，问随车售票员，答道：“加收５０％空车费１．５元。”
    旅客问为什么要加收空车费？回答说这是汾阳汽车运输公司规定的。从离石到三交镇，汽车票价１．２元，我等了几辆车都要３元，后来等到一辆车要２．５元，眼看天色不早，只好上车，否则天黑也到不了。
    车辆养护差。３月１日，我们好不容易坐上汽车从临县向太原出发，可是当车行至太原市郊清徐县姚村附近时却发生了故障，司机下车敲打了几下说：“车坏了，走不成了，你们下去坐市内公共汽车吧！”。无奈，旅客们只好再花０．８元车费改坐市内公共汽车进城。万幸的是，长途汽车到太原市郊才坏，还有市内公共汽车可坐，如果坏在半路，而不是太原市郊，我当天就无法赶到太原了。
