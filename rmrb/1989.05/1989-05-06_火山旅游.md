Volcanic tourism

The Lonquimay volcano in Chile, which began erupting last Christmas, is still active and has become a major attraction. The newly formed crater, named "Christmas," is about 500 meters in diameter and 400 meters deep. Smoke columns rising from the crater reach heights of 500 to 800 meters. The glowing lava flows slowly out, filling the air with the smell of sulfur, and the ground trembles slightly with a rumbling sound. All of this is undoubtedly very appealing to city dwellers. Every weekend, hundreds of people come to the western slope of Lonquimay to watch the volcanic eruption.

To prevent accidents, the Chilean military has set up a security perimeter around the volcano and designated observation points. A shop selling drinks and food there is doing brisk business. Most residents of the town of Malalcahuello, just 8 kilometers from the crater, have moved away because volcanic ash severely affects their farming and grazing. Scientists predict that the Lonquimay volcano will not go extinct in the short term, but it will not develop into a catastrophic eruption. The volcano's eruption in 1887 lasted for two years.

　　火山旅游
    去年圣诞节开始喷发的智利隆基玛依火山仍在活动，成为一大奇观。这次新生的火山口被命名为“圣诞”，直径约５００米，深４００米，从火山口升起的烟柱高５００—８００米。那闪着红光的熔岩缓缓流出，空气中弥漫着硫磺气味，大地在不停地轻微震动并发出隆隆的响声……这一切对生活在城市的人来说无疑有很大的吸引力。每到周末，总有数百人来隆基玛依的西部山坡，观赏火山喷发景象。
    为了防止发生事故，智利军队在火山附近布置了警戒线，确定了观测点。那里一间出售饮料和食品的商店生意十分兴隆。离火山口仅８公里远的马拉尔卡乌埃略镇大部分居民已经搬走，因为火山灰严重影响他们播种和放牧。科学家们预计，隆基玛依火山短期内不会熄灭，但也不会发展为灾难性的喷发。这座火山１８８７年的喷发曾延续了两年时间。
