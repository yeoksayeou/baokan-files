Recently, there has been much discussion about the foreign-brand beverages like Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta that are actively present in the market. Some people say that using the country's limited foreign exchange to introduce the production of such beverages is not putting the money to good use. Others believe that the market impact of joint-venture foreign beverages suppresses the development of domestic industrial products.

Du Xinyang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Shanghai Shenmei Beverage Food Co., Ltd., a joint venture between Shanghai and Coca-Cola Company, believes that through cooperation, we have introduced both capital and technology, which is beneficial to the country. The appearance of Coca-Cola, Sprite, and Fanta has filled some gaps in domestic beverages and improved the quality of domestic beverages.

Domestically produced Coca-Cola meets the consumption needs of foreign tourists visiting China. Previously, Shanghai had to spend over $10 million annually to import Coca-Cola for major hotels. Now, domestic products have replaced imports. Last year, Shanghai Pujian Beverage Factory, after deducting foreign exchange for imported packaging materials, sugar, and concentrate, created a net foreign exchange income of over $5 million.

Will domestically produced Coca-Cola series products pose a threat to other domestic beverage products? According to industry insiders, in recent years, Coca-Cola Company has established 11 joint ventures or product introduction projects in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Nanning. Some produce Coca-Cola, while others produce Sprite and Fanta. Du Xinyang said that products like Sprite and Fanta may exert some pressure on state-owned enterprise products, but they will also have a promoting effect and will not pose a threat. Currently, Shanghai Shenmei Company produces 20,000 tons of Sprite and Fanta annually, while this year's total beverage production in Shanghai is approximately 250,000 tons. Therefore, it will not suppress the development of domestic industrial products.

Facing the aggressive approach of joint-venture enterprises, Li Jianuo, Deputy Director of Shanghai Gas Water Factory, the largest beverage production enterprise in Shanghai, and colleagues from the market information department said that Shanghai's Zhengguang and Fresh Orange Water have won national silver awards, and the quality of other beverages is also excellent. They are fully capable of competing with joint-venture enterprise products. We are not afraid of the quality of joint-venture enterprise products; what we are concerned about is that we are competing under unequal conditions: First, the pricing of state-owned products is subject to various constraints and cannot be easily adjusted upwards, while joint-venture enterprise products have higher pricing and more flexible sales methods, making stores more willing to sell their products. Second, due to certain restrictions, transportation difficulties have become the main problem in after-sales service. Now, the products of Shanghai Gas Water Factory can hardly be found on major commercial streets such as Nanjing Road, Huaihai Road, and Sichuan Road in Shanghai, but can only be seen in oil and sauce stores, small alleys, and third-industry counters in factories. The market share has dropped from 62.8% in 1985 to 30.6% last year. It seems that in the process of introducing and absorbing, we still need to pay attention to creating an equal competitive environment for domestic enterprises.

### 面对“洋饮料”的冲击……

　　面对“洋饮料”的冲击……
    近来，人们对于活跃在市场上的可口可乐、雪碧、芬达等外国牌子、中国制造的饮料议论颇多。有人说，把国家有限的外汇用于引进生产这种饮料，是没有把钱用在刀刃上；也有人认为，合资生产的洋饮料冲击市场，抑制了民族工业产品的发展。
    上海与可口可乐公司合作经营的上海申美饮料食品有限公司管委会主席杜鑫翔认为，通过合作我们引进了资金、引进了技术，对国家是有利的。可口可乐、雪碧、芬达的出现，填补了国内饮料中的一些缺门，提高了国内饮料的档次。
    我国生产的可口可乐满足了来华的外国游客的消费需要。过去，上海市每年需花１０００多万美元进口各大宾馆所需的可口可乐，现在国产货替代了进口货。上海浦江饮料厂去年扣除包装材料、糖、浓缩液的进口外汇，当年净创汇５００多万美元。
    我国生产的可口可乐系列产品对于我国的其他饮料产品会不会有威胁呢？据内行人士介绍，近几年来，可口可乐公司先后在北京、上海、广州、厦门、南宁等国内城市搞了１１个合资或产品引进项目。有的生产可口可乐，有的生产雪碧、芬达。杜鑫翔说，雪碧、芬达之类的产品可能对国营企业的产品有些压力，有些促进，但不会构成威胁。目前，上海申美公司一年生产雪碧、芬达２万吨，而今年该市的饮料产量约２５万吨，所以不会抑制民族工业产品的发展。
    面对合资企业咄咄逼人的攻势，上海市最大的饮料生产企业上海汽水厂的副厂长李建国与市场信息科的一些同志说，上海的正广和鲜桔水曾获国家银质奖，其他一些饮料质量也属上乘，完全有能力与合资企业的产品竞争。我们并不害怕合资企业产品的质量，我们担心的是我们处在不平等的条件下竞争：第一，国营产品的价格受到多种制约，难以向上浮动，而合资企业的产品由于定价较高，销售手段又灵活，商店愿意销售他们的产品；第二，由于某些限制，运输难成了售后服务的主要难题。现在，上海汽水厂的产品在上海南京路、淮海路、四川路等主要商业街已经难以觅到了，而只能在油酱店、小弄堂、工厂的第三产业柜台上亮相，市场占有率从１９８５年的６２．８％下降到去年的３０．６％。看来，我们在引进、吸收的过程中，还须注意为国内企业创造一个平等的竞争环境。
