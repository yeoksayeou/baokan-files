The Nomura Research Institute recently released its outlook for the world economy in the 1990s, predicting that the global economic growth rate will be approximately 3.3%. It also anticipates that trade friction between Japan and Europe will intensify.

According to the institute's estimates, Japan's economic growth rate in the 1990s will be around 3.9%, while both the United States and the European Community will see a growth rate of 2.7%. Newly industrialized countries and regions in Asia are expected to achieve growth rates exceeding 7%.

The institute believes that in the 1990s, Japan's increased overseas direct investment will lead to a decrease in exports. Additionally, with the rise in imports of non-commodity products, Japan's trade surplus will drop from $95 billion in 1988 to below $37.5 billion. However, Japan's trade surplus with Europe will become more pronounced. With the establishment of the European single market in 1992, protectionism and regionalism will intensify, exacerbating trade friction between Japan and Europe.

In contrast, by 1995, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan is expected to decrease from approximately $50 billion in 1988 to $18 billion, potentially easing trade friction between the two countries.

Furthermore, it is projected that by 1995, the U.S. net foreign debt will reach $1.3 trillion, accounting for 17% of its GDP for that year. Conversely, Japan's net foreign assets will amount to $720 billion.

　　野村研究所展望９０年代世界经济
    日本野村综合研究所在最近发表的９０年代世界经济展望中说，到９０年代，世界经济实际增长率约为３．３％，日欧贸易摩擦将加剧。
    据估计，在９０年代，日本经济实际增长率将为３．９％，美国和欧洲共同体均为２．７％，而亚洲新兴工业国家和地区将达到７％以上。
    这家研究所认为，在９０年代，日本由于海外直接投资的增加，出口将减少，再加上非原材料产品的进口增加，贸易盈余将从１９８８年度的９５０亿美元降至３７５亿美元以下。但是，日本对欧洲的出超将变得突出，同时，随着１９９２年西欧统一市场的建立，贸易保护主义和地区主义倾向将会加剧，从而导致日欧贸易摩擦愈演愈烈。
    与此相反，到１９９５年，美国对日贸易赤字额将从１９８８年的约５００亿美元减少到１８０亿美元，届时日美贸易摩擦将趋缓解。
    另据推测，到１９９５年，美国的对外纯债务额将增至１．３万亿美元，为同年国民生产总值的１７％。相反，日本的对外纯债权额将达到７２００亿美元。
