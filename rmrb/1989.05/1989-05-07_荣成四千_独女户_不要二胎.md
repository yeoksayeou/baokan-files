The traditional notion of "the more children, the more blessings" in Rongcheng City, Shandong Province, is gradually being replaced by the scientific concept of "quality over quantity" in childbearing. As the local economy improves, farmers no longer rely on having many children to support them in old age. Across the entire city, 4,358 rural households have voluntarily given up their second-child birth permits, choosing to remain "single-daughter households."

In recent years, Rongcheng's rural economy and social welfare have seen significant development. Last year, the city's total rural economic income reached 180 million yuan, with an average per capita income of 905 yuan. Nearly 100 well-equipped elderly care homes have been established at the township and village levels. Many wealthy villages have even implemented retirement systems, providing retired farmers with monthly pensions.

　　荣成四千“独女户”不要二胎
    本报讯  “多子多福”的传统生育观在山东省荣成市已逐渐被“优生优育”的科学观所取代，富裕了的农民不再企望“养儿防老”，全市农村有４３５８户自愿退掉二胎生育指标，甘当“独女户”。
    近几年，荣成市农村经济和社会福利事业有了长足发展。去年，全市农村经济总收入达到１８亿元，农民人均分配９０５元；已建起设施配套的乡、村敬老院近百家，不少富裕村还实行了退休制，农民退休后可以按月领取一份退休金。
