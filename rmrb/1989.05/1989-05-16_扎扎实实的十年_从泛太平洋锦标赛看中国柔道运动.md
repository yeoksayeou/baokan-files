The sixth Pan-Pacific Judo Championships, hosted by our country, received praise from the International Judo Federation and the participating teams. The chairman of the International Judo Federation, Carlos, said, "China is hosting such a large international judo competition for the first time, and it can be said that the work in all aspects is satisfactory." The significant progress of Chinese athletes, especially the rapid growth of female athletes, has attracted widespread attention.

A Decade of Achievements

The history of judo in China is only ten years old, making it the youngest among many competitive sports. Additionally, due to the lack of familiarity among spectators, it has received less support from various aspects. Under these circumstances, our coaches and athletes did not complain about their difficulties but worked diligently and solidly. Previously, the only Chinese female judokas that left a deep impression were Gao Fenglian and Li Zhongyun. Now, a large number of outstanding athletes such as Zhang Di, Chang Fengxia, and Zhuang Xiaoyan have emerged. In the finals, several projects were contested between Chinese female athletes, showcasing their strength. The leader of the Chinese Taipei team, Wu Dechun, said, "New Zealand took 30 years to win a gold medal in a world-class competition, but you achieved such great results in just 10 years, which is truly remarkable."

Walking Our Own Path

During an interview with Guo Zhonggang, the secretary-general of the organizing committee for the sixth Pan-Pacific Judo Championships, the reporter asked why the Chinese team could achieve such good results in a short period.

He summarized three points: first, learning while absorbing; second, innovating techniques and updating training methods; third, absorbing the strengths of Chinese-style wrestling and daring to create our own style. In essence, it is about walking our own path. When developing a new project, if one only imitates others, one can only be passively beaten. To defeat the master, one must use new moves, and these new moves are the result of absorption and innovation.

More Support Needed

Judo in China has a short development history and is still young, lacking experience. The phenomenon of "women strong, men weak" is more pronounced in this sport.

In this competition, Chinese men did not taste the sweetness of victory, and it was even difficult for them to reach the finals. To change this situation, more support is needed from all sides. Although judo is now practiced in more than 20 provinces and cities nationwide, there is a universal shortage of funds. Additionally, the source of athletes is limited, making it difficult to select good talents. Both men's and women's judo have entered the Olympic family. We should use our best resources to train good seeds in judo, enhancing our country's strength in winning judo gold medals in the Olympics.

　　扎扎实实的十年   
    ——从泛太平洋锦标赛看中国柔道运动
    本报记者  黄振中
    由我国举办的第六届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛，受到国际柔联和各参赛队的称赞。国际柔联主席卡洛里安说：“中国第一次承办这样大型的国际柔道赛，应该说各方面工作令人满意。”中国选手的长足进步，尤其是女运动员的快速成长更引起大家的关注。
    十年的结晶
    中国开展柔道运动的历史仅有十年，比起其它许多竞技项目，它是小弟弟。另外，由于观众对其不熟悉，它得到各方面的支持比较少。在这种情况下，我国教练员、运动员等，不是怨天尤人，而是在困难情况下扎扎实实地干。以前中国女将给人印象深的只有高凤莲和李忠云，现在又涌现出张迪、常凤霞、庄晓严等一大批名将。决赛中，有几个项目是在中国女将之间进行，可见实力之强。中国台北队领队吴德纯说：“新西兰用了３０年时间才在世界级比赛中取得一枚金牌，你们只花了１０年时间就取得如此大的成绩，确实不易。”
    走自己的路
    记者访问本届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛组委会秘书长郭仲恭时，问到中国队为何能在短期内取得好成绩。
    他概括地讲了三点：一是边学习边吸收；二是革新技术，更新训练方法；三是吸收中国式摔跤等长处，敢于创造自己的打法。集中起来就是走自己的路。开展一个新项目，如果是光模仿别人，只能是被动挨打。学生要能打赢先生，只有用新招，而这种新招又是吸收和创新的结晶。
    还要各方多支持
    柔道运动在我国发展历史短，毕竟还年轻，缺乏经验。“阴盛阳衰”的现象在这个项目上显得更为明显。
    中国男子汉们在本届大赛中未尝到冠军滋味，连进决赛都很困难。要改变这种状况，还需要各方多支持。现在全国虽有２０多个省市开展柔道运动，但普遍都感到经费不足，此外队员的来源少，很难选到好材。柔道男女项目都进入奥林匹克大家庭，我们应该把好钢用在刀刃上，主动输送身体素质和心理素质好的苗子学柔道，增强我国在奥运会上夺取柔道项目金牌的实力。
