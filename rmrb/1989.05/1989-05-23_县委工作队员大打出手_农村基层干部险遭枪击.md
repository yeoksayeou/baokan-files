On December 17, 1988, the Meitan County Committee dispatched a work team consisting of Xie Shangda, Wang Zhixue, Luo Dejun, and Zhou Qian to our township. Xie Shangda declared, "I came down to deal with the local tyrants." On December 19, our township's Party Committee Secretary was out on work and borrowed the work team's jeep. Zhou Qian was very displeased. The township's women's affairs director, Hu Xuehui, explained, "Secretary Huang is using the car for work!" Zhou Qian immediately cursed and slapped Hu Xuehui several times, then accused the township cadres of insulting him. Hu Xuehui reported the incident to the township's deputy Party Committee Secretary. Twenty minutes later, Zhou Qian, Xie Shangda, Luo Dejun, and Wang Zhixue stormed into the township Party Committee office, shouting, "Hu, we're taking you with us to the countryside today!" Deputy Director Zhu hurriedly tried to mediate, "Hu Xuehui can't leave, I'll take you." Wang Zhixue punched Hu Xuehui on the head twice, Zhou Qian kicked Hu Xuehui's feet, and Luo Dejun drew his gun and fired at Hu Xuehui. A township cadre quickly raised Luo Dejun's wrist, and the bullet hit the wall above Hu Xuehui's head. Upon investigation, they had no gun permit.

After the incident, Xie, Luo, Wang, and Zhou fled the scene in the chaos and returned to the county. The township cadres reported the incident to the relevant departments of the district and county, demanding the handling of the involved individuals, but there has been no response so far.

　　县委工作队员大打出手
    农村基层干部险遭枪击
    １９８８年１２月１７日，湄潭县委抽调谢尚达、王志学、罗德君和周谦等人组成的工作队到我乡。谢尚达声称“下乡专门打霸王”。１２月１９日，我乡党委书记外出工作，借用工作队的吉普车，周谦很不满意。乡妇女主任胡学会解释说，“黄书记用车是为了工作！”周谦当即破口大骂，随手打了胡学会几个耳光，并反说乡干部侮辱他。胡学会向乡党委副书记反映了此事。２０分钟后，周谦、谢尚达、罗德君、王志学气势汹汹地冲进乡党委办公室吼叫道：“姓胡的，老子们今天要你带路下乡！”朱乡长慌忙劝解：“胡学会无法脱身，我带你们去。”王志学对着胡学会的头上狠击两拳，周谦朝着胡学会的脚乱踢，罗德君拔出手枪，朝胡学会开枪。一乡干部眼明手快，把罗德君的手腕向上一抬，子弹射入胡学会头部上方的墙壁。经查，他们没有持枪证。
    事情发生后，谢、罗、王、周４人趁混乱急忙逃离现场，跑回县里。乡干部向区、县有关领导部门写报告要求查处有关人员，但迟迟未见查处。
