Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th.

Is the space industry profitable or not? The answer from the head of the Soviet Union's General Machine Building Department, Doguzhiyev, is "profitable."

He used the "Energy-Buran" space shuttle system as an example to illustrate his point. The construction of the space shuttle system took 13 years and cost 14 billion rubles. However, by utilizing this system and the technological innovations developed during its construction, 4 to 5 billion rubles can be earned annually.

	Spacecraft and Mixing Machines

The "Energy" rocket has over 20,000 welded joints. The automatic welding method developed by researchers ensures absolute sealing of these joints. This technology can be applied in the petroleum, chemical, nuclear power industries, as well as in dairy and sugar factories. The silver-free welding rods used on spacecraft are used for welding refrigerator compressors, saving 2 tons of silver for every million refrigerators produced.

The high-precision casting and sealing technology used in the "Buran" space shuttle can be applied to the production of mixing machine parts and moldings for picture tubes.

	Engines and Meat Grinders

High-strength stainless steel was developed during the manufacture of the "Energy" rocket engines. Using this steel for meat grinder blades can significantly improve the quality of meat products and save over 10 million foreign exchange rubles that would otherwise be spent on importing blades.

The refractory glass fibers developed during the construction of the "Buran" space shuttle can be used to manufacture subway cars, greatly enhancing the safety of subway systems. The composite materials developed for spacecraft can replace stainless steel in the production of food packaging boxes, generating 17,000 rubles in economic benefits for every ton of composite material used.

Ceramic components used on spacecraft, when applied to water faucets, can save 20 to 30 cubic meters of water per faucet annually. Nationwide, this can amount to a total water savings of 6 to 8 billion rubles.

	Launching and Maintaining Space Equipment

The "Energy-Buran" space shuttle system can launch heavy space equipment, such as an 18-ton communication platform (the current "Horizon" communication satellite is only 2.5 tons). A satellite relay network composed of 4 such platforms can solve the problem of 480,000 long-distance telephone lines.

It can also launch components for space factories that produce ultra-pure materials, and repair optical and radio observation satellites in space, extending their service life from 2 to 3 years to 5 to 7 years.

Launching space equipment with this system has another advantage: if a problem is discovered with the equipment, it can be brought back to Earth. This is economically very advantageous because manufacturing a piece of space equipment costs billions of rubles and requires the labor of hundreds of enterprises over 5 to 7 years.

In the event of a malfunction in an orbital station or a manned spacecraft, the space shuttle system can serve as a rescue vessel, saving astronauts.

### 搞宇航事业“赚”还是“赔”——苏联答曰“赚”

    搞宇航事业“赚”还是“赔”——
    苏联答曰“赚”
    新华社莫斯科5月29日电  搞宇航是“赚”还是“赔”？苏联通用机器制造部长多古日耶夫的回答是“赚”。
    这位部长以“能源—暴风雪”号航天飞机系统为例，说明了自己的观点。航天飞机系统的制造用了13年时间，耗资140亿卢布。而利用这个系统及该系统制造过程中的科技发明成果，一年即可得到40至50亿卢布。
          航天机与和面机
    “能源”号火箭有2万多个管道焊接口，研究人员研究出的自动焊接法能保证接口绝对密封。这一工艺可用于石油化工、核动力工业及牛奶厂和制糖厂。航天机上用的不含银焊条用于冰箱压缩机的焊接，每百万台冰箱即可节省2吨白银。
    “暴风雪”号航天飞机采用的高精度密封浇铸法，可用来制造和面机零件和显像管冲模。
          发动机与绞肉机
    制造“能源”号火箭的发动机时发明了高强度不锈钢，用它作绞肉机刀片，可大大改善肉品质量，节省进口刀片所需的1000多万外汇卢布。
    用制造“暴风雪”号航天飞机时研制成的耐火玻璃纤维制作地铁车厢，能大大提高地铁的安全程度。制造航天机时造出的复合材料，可代替不锈钢制造食品包装箱，一吨复合材料能带来1.7万卢布的经济效益。
    用在航天机上使用的陶瓷配件装备水龙头，一年一个自来水龙头能节水20至30立方米，全国加起来节水总值可达6亿—8亿卢布。
        发射和维修宇宙装置
    “能源—暴风雪”号航天飞机系统可以发射大重量宇宙装置，如18吨重的通信平台（现有的“地平线”号通信卫星只有2.5吨重）。4个这样的平台组成的卫星转播网，能解决48万对长途话路。
    它还可以发射制造超纯度材料的宇宙工厂构件，维修处在空间轨道上的光电和无线电观察卫星，使这些卫星的使用寿命从2至3年延长为5至7年。
    用这一系统发射宇宙装置还有一个优点，即临时发现宇宙装置有毛病，可把它重新带回地面。这在经济上是极为合算的，因为制造一个宇宙装置需耗资数亿卢布，还要花去数百家企业5—7年的劳动。
    轨道站或者运送人员的宇宙交通船发生故障时，航天飞机系统可以充当救生船，拯救宇航员。
