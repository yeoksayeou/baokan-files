After your newspaper published the letter to the editor titled "Mixing Raw Coal with Gangue Harms Both the Country and the People" on January 18 on the fifth page, our township's Party committee and government organized a team including the public security bureau to go to Wu Zhuang Village. We dismantled the gangue-crushing machine and fined the responsible parties.
