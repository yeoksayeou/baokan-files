A New Chapter in Sino-North Korean Friendship

— Warm Congratulations on the Successful Visit of Comrade Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary, to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea

Comrade Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the invitation of Comrade Kim Il Sung, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, has completed his official friendly visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, a close neighbor, and returned to Beijing yesterday. This visit further strengthened the friendly relations between the two parties, the two countries, and the peoples of the two countries. We warmly congratulate Comrade Zhao Ziyang on the complete success of his visit.

This is Comrade Zhao Ziyang's first overseas visit since assuming the position of General Secretary. He was warmly and enthusiastically welcomed everywhere by the Workers' Party of Korea, the government, and the people, fully demonstrating the fraternal and close relations between the two parties, the two countries, and the peoples of the two countries.

The leaders of the two parties and the two countries frequently visit each other like relatives, exchange views, and deepen friendships. This is a fine tradition initiated by Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and Comrade Kim Il Sung. In recent years, through frequent mutual visits and cordial talks, the leaders of the two parties and the two countries have further carried forward this tradition, promoting the great friendship between China and North Korea to continuously develop. In the face of the changing international situation, the leaders of the two parties and the two countries need to meet more frequently, deepen understanding and mutual understanding. During this visit, Comrade Zhao Ziyang and Comrade Kim Il Sung held two talks in a friendly and cordial atmosphere. They exchanged information on their respective domestic situations and exchanged views on bilateral relations, the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and major international issues of common concern, reaching broad consensus. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's visit has made an important contribution to pushing Sino-North Korean friendship to a new stage and to easing the situation on the Korean Peninsula and maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

The hardworking, brave, and wise people of North Korea, under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and Comrade Kim Il Sung, have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of independence and self-reliance, and through arduous struggles, have turned North Korea, which was once poor and backward, into a prosperous socialist country. Now, they are deeply carrying out the three revolutions of ideology, technology, and culture, striving to complete the third seven-year plan ahead of schedule and accelerate socialist construction. During this visit, Comrade Zhao Ziyang once again saw the tremendous changes in North Korea's socialist construction, which left a deeper impression compared to his visit seven years ago. The new achievements of the North Korean people have made all Chinese comrades both admire and be inspired.

Unifying the artificially divided motherland is the common national aspiration of all the Korean people. The Workers' Party of Korea and the government have made unremitting efforts for this over the years. Since last year, in order to ease the situation on the Korean Peninsula and create favorable conditions and atmosphere for the peaceful reunification of Korea, they have put forward a package of peace plans and various reasonable initiatives. During this visit, Comrade Zhao Ziyang reiterated that the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government have always unswervingly supported the just cause of the Korean people in striving for self-determination and peaceful reunification. We have always believed that the issue of peaceful reunification of Korea should be resolved through consultations among the Korean people without external interference. The United States should withdraw all its troops and military facilities from South Korea and stop joint military exercises that could exacerbate tensions in the region. We are confident that through efforts, the 3,000-li beautiful mountains and rivers will eventually end the division, and the 60 million Korean people will definitely achieve national reunification.

The two parties, the two countries, and the peoples of the two countries have forged a great friendship in their common struggle against imperialism. Today, in their respective socialist constructions, they support, rely on, and understand each other. History has proven that Sino-North Korean friendship can withstand tests. The Chinese people cherish this friendship and will, as always, strive to pass it on from generation to generation, making it shine forever.

　　中朝友谊新篇章   
    ——热烈祝贺赵紫阳总书记访问朝鲜圆满成功
    中共中央总书记赵紫阳同志，应朝鲜劳动党总书记金日成同志的邀请，对亲密邻邦朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行的正式友好访问已经结束，昨天回到北京。这次访问，进一步增强了中朝两党、两国和两国人民的友好情谊。我们热烈祝贺赵紫阳总书记的访问圆满成功。
    这是赵紫阳同志担任总书记后的首次出访，到处受到朝鲜劳动党、政府和人民盛大隆重而热烈的欢迎，充分显示了中朝两党、两国和两国人民兄弟般的亲密关系。
    中朝两党、两国领导人像走亲戚一样常来常往，交换意见，增进友谊，这是由毛泽东同志、周恩来同志和金日成同志所开创的良好传统。近年来，我们两党、两国领导人通过频繁互访，亲切交谈，进一步发扬了这个传统，推动着伟大的中朝友谊不断向前发展。在当前国际形势不断变化的情况下，我们两党、两国领导人更需要经常见面，加深了解和理解。在这次访问中，赵紫阳同志同金日成同志通过两次会谈，在亲切友好的气氛中，相互通报了各自国内的情况，并就双边关系、朝鲜半岛局势和共同关心的重大国际问题交换意见，取得了广泛一致的看法。赵紫阳同志的这次访问，为把中朝友谊推向新的阶段，为缓和朝鲜半岛的局势、维护亚洲乃至世界的和平作出了重要贡献。
    勤劳、勇敢、智慧的朝鲜人民，在朝鲜劳动党和金日成同志的领导下，发扬独立自主、自力更生的革命精神，经过艰苦奋斗，把曾经是贫穷落后的朝鲜建设成繁荣昌盛的社会主义国家。现在，又在深入开展思想、技术、文化三大革命，为提前完成第三个七年计划，加速社会主义建设而努力奋斗。赵紫阳同志在这次访问中，再次看到朝鲜社会主义建设事业日新月异的巨大变化，同７年前访朝时相比，印象更加深刻。朝鲜人民所取得的新成就，使所有的中国同志既感到钦佩，又受到鼓舞。
    统一被人为分裂的祖国，是全体朝鲜人民共同的民族愿望。朝鲜劳动党和政府多年来为此作出了不懈的努力。去年以来，为了缓和朝鲜半岛局势，创造有利于朝鲜和平统一的气氛和条件，又提出一揽子和平方案以及各项合理倡议。在这次访问中，赵紫阳同志重申，中国共产党和中国政府始终不渝地支持朝鲜人民争取自主和平统一的正义事业。我们历来认为，朝鲜的和平统一问题，应该在没有外来干涉的情况下，由朝鲜人民自己协商解决。美国应该从南朝鲜撤走其全部驻军和军事设施，应该停止有可能加剧该地区紧张局势的联合军事演习。我们坚信，经过努力，三千里锦绣江山终将结束分裂局面，六千万朝鲜人民一定会实现民族团圆。
    中朝两党、两国和两国人民在共同反对帝国主义的斗争中用鲜血凝成了伟大的友谊，今天在各自的社会主义建设中又互相支持、互相信赖和互相理解。历史证明，中朝友谊是经受得起考验的。中国人民十分珍惜这种友谊，将一如既往，努力使之世代相传，永发光辉。
