Ethnic Conflict and Industrial Strike: Tension Escalates in Nagorno-Karabakh

According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 9th: The situation in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic has recently become tense again. Authorities have announced an extension of the curfew in the capital Stepanakert and other areas.

In September of last year, clashes occurred between Armenian Christians and Azerbaijani Muslims in Stepanakert. On the 21st of that month, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR declared a curfew in the city and surrounding areas. Since the beginning of this year, the situation in these places has been relatively calm.

Recently, conflicts between the two ethnic groups have resurfaced. They have been throwing stones at each other's vehicles, making it difficult for some workers to go to work. Strikes have occurred in some factories and enterprises. The majority of Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have once again raised the demand to separate the region from Azerbaijani jurisdiction.

It is believed that the fundamental cause of the strikes is the Armenians' dissatisfaction with the faster development of economic and social facilities in Azerbaijani villages within the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Additionally, the refugee problem has become increasingly acute.

Currently, the number of refugees in Stepanakert has reached 20% of the total population.

　　民族冲突　企业罢工   
    苏纳卡州局势趋紧
    据新华社莫斯科５月９日电  苏联阿塞拜疆加盟共和国的纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫自治州最近形势又趋紧张，当局宣布对该州首府斯捷潘纳克特等地延长宵禁时间。
    去年９月，信仰基督教的亚美尼亚人和信仰伊斯兰教的阿塞拜疆人在斯捷潘纳克特发生械斗。当月２１日，苏共中央和苏联最高苏维埃主席团宣布对该市等地实行宵禁。从今年年初起这些地方局势相对平静。
    最近，亚阿两族又出现冲突，互相用石块袭击对方汽车，一些职工因此无法上班。在一些工厂企业发生了罢工。纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫的大部分亚美尼亚族人重又提出使该州脱离阿塞拜疆管辖的要求。
    据认为，罢工的基本原因是亚美尼亚人对纳—卡州境内阿塞拜疆人居住的农村经济和社会设施发展比他们快不满。此外，难民问题也日益尖锐。
    目前在斯捷潘纳克特难民人数已达居民总数的２０％。
