The Ministry of Civil Affairs conducted an evaluation of departmental documents, marking the first such activity in a national government agency. Nineteen outstanding documents were awarded.

This initiative is a significant measure to enhance the quality of documents within the Ministry of Civil Affairs. During the evaluation process, strict standards were applied, with 50 initially selected documents scored and reviewed individually. The winning documents all scored above 90 points. Experts, scholars, and committee members from relevant fields gave high praise. Professor Chen Chuancai, Deputy Director of the Language Department at Renmin University of China, stated that the winning documents from the Ministry of Civil Affairs will be used as model texts to guide students in their writing. He also noted that while the winning documents are not perfect, there are still some grammatical, textual, and punctuation issues that need improvement. Minister of Civil Affairs Cui Naiwu urged departmental leaders and all staff to strengthen their learning, meticulously refine their writing, and carefully craft each document to elevate the overall quality of departmental documents.

    开展这一活动，是提高民政部公文质量的一项重要措施。评比过程中，实行严格把关，对５０篇初选公文按标准打分并逐篇评议。这次评选出来的获奖公文，得分都在９０分以上。有关方面的专家、学者、评委们都给予了较高的评价。中国人民大学语言系副主任陈传才教授表示要将民政部的获奖公文作为范文教材，指导学生写作。他同时指出，获奖公文并不是尽善尽美，个别语法、文字、标点等方面还存在着个别不规范的地方。民政部部长崔乃夫要求机关领导和全体工作人员加强学习，精雕细刻，字斟句酌，认真写好每一篇公文，以促进机关公文质量的提高。　　　　　　　（赵宝玉）
