In the sparkling waters of the southwestern Indian Ocean, there is a tiny island nation of just 1,865 square kilometers and a population of approximately 1.05 million—Mauritius.

During our visit, we learned that due to the thriving export processing industry, Mauritius' economy has seen a "miracle," earning it the reputation of being the "economic tiger of the Indian Ocean."

Historically, Mauritius has heavily relied on sugarcane cultivation and sugar exports, resulting in a single economic structure. Although it is the largest sugar producer and exporter in Africa, it has faced numerous challenges. When Mauritius gained independence in 1968, it implemented an import substitution development strategy. Due to the small domestic market, limited natural resources, and insufficient development funds, the growth of import substitution industries was inevitably constrained. The Mauritian government, seizing the opportunity, made timely adjustments and adopted an export-oriented development strategy. In December 1970, it enacted the "Export Processing Zone Law," beginning the establishment of small, labor-intensive processing industries aimed at exports.

After 18 years of ups and downs, the export processing industry has grown from small to large and from weak to strong, achieving remarkable results and replacing the sugar industry as the country's primary economic pillar. In 18 years, the number of export processing enterprises increased from 10 to 600; employment rose from 644 to 91,800; export value surged from 3.9 million rupees to 8.5 billion rupees, accounting for 60.1% of the country's total export value, up from 1%. Since 1985, its export value and employment have both surpassed the sugar industry, marking a "turning point in Mauritius' economic history." Currently, the export processing zone is dominated by the garment industry, with other sectors including watch assembly, toy production, jewelry processing, and plastic products. Notably, Mauritius has become the world's third-largest exporter of woolen products, a significant achievement for a country that does not produce wool.

The prosperity of the export processing zone has profoundly changed Mauritius' economic landscape. This is evident in:

- The significant strengthening of national economic power. Over 18 years, the average annual growth rate of GDP has been around 6.5%, far outpacing other African countries; per capita GDP has nearly tripled, reaching an estimated $1,700 in 1988, ranking second in sub-Saharan Africa.
- Fundamental changes in the economic and export structures. In the composition of GDP, agriculture decreased from 25.8% in 1971 to 10.6% in 1988, while industry increased from 16.5% to 22.2%. Industry has far surpassed agriculture and now dominates the national economy. In the export composition, the share of sugar exports in the total export value dropped from over 90% at the time of independence to 30.8% in 1988, completely breaking away from the long-term dependence on sugar exports.
- Breakthroughs in the tourism industry. Over 18 years, the number of tourists and tourism revenue increased from 27,600 and 30 million rupees to 230,000 and 2.5 billion rupees, respectively. In terms of tourist numbers, Mauritius ranks third in sub-Saharan Africa.
- The resolution of the long-standing unemployment problem. The prosperity of the export processing zone has created a significant number of job opportunities, essentially achieving full employment.

The above facts clearly show that the revitalization of the export processing zone has not only changed Mauritius' fragile single economic structure but also injected vitality and dynamism into the entire economy, promoting economic and social development and progress.

The rapid rise of the export processing zone is not a random economic phenomenon but the result of the long-term interplay of various favorable factors. These factors mainly include:

- Political and social stability. Mauritius is a multi-party state, and since independence, there have been no coups, with power transitions occurring through elections. This stable political and social environment is highly attractive to foreign investors.
- The international environment has provided conditions for the rise of the export processing zone. As a member of the Lomé Convention, Mauritius' export processing zone products can enter the EEC market duty-free and without quotas, thus securing one of the most basic conditions for developing an export-oriented economy—guaranteed export markets.
- Economic development policies and strategies are in line with national realities. In terms of economic development policies, all Mauritian governments have advocated for a "mixed economy," clearly stating that private enterprises will not be nationalized and taking various measures to actively promote the development of private capital. Nearly half of the capital in the export processing zone comes from local entrepreneurs.
- Special preferential policies for foreign investment. For export processing zone enterprises, the government exempts taxes on the import of machinery, equipment, and spare parts; exempts taxes on the import of raw materials and semi-finished products and license taxes; symbolically levies a 15% corporate tax; exempts dividend income tax for the first 10 years; allows the free remittance of enterprise capital (including capital appreciation), profits, and dividends; allows the transfer of shares; provides water and electricity at cost price; offers low-cost enterprise housing and land rent, and reduces the registration tax by 50%; and provides preferential treatment in loan interest rates, insurance services, and customs inspections. These policies have greatly stimulated the desire and enthusiasm of overseas investors, playing a decisive role in the prosperity of the export processing zone.
- Mauritius itself possesses superior conditions for developing the export processing zone. First, Mauritius is located at a strategic crossroads between Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, with relatively developed economic and social infrastructure such as transportation, water and electricity supply, postal and telecommunications services, and financial services. Second, it has a sufficient, low-cost, and high-quality labor force that can meet the needs of the export processing zone for various employees.

　　毛里求斯出口加工业创奇迹
    刘郧生
    在碧波粼粼的印度洋西南部，有一个面积只有１８６５平方公里，人口约１０５万的袖珍岛国——毛里求斯。
    我们在访问中了解到，由于出口加工业蓬勃发展，毛里求斯经济出现了“奇迹”，因而被人们誉为“印度洋上的一只经济猛虎”。
    由于历史原因，毛里求斯过去严重依赖甘蔗种植和蔗糖出口，形成单一的经济结构，虽然是非洲最大的蔗糖生产国和出口国，但遇到不少困难。毛里求斯１９６８年独立时，曾实施进口替代发展战略。由于国内市场容量小、国家自然资源贫乏和发展资金不足，进口替代工业的发展势必受到种种限制。毛里求斯政府审时度势，适时进行调整，推行出口导向发展战略，并于１９７０年１２月颁行《出口加工区法》，开始兴办以出口为目标的小型劳动密集型加工业。
    经过１８年的风风雨雨，出口加工业从小到大，由弱变强，取得了令人瞩目的成就，并取代糖业，成为国民经济的第一支柱。１８年间，出口加工企业从１０家发展到６００家；就业人数由６４４人增至９．１８万人；出口值从３９０万卢比猛增到８５亿卢比，占国家出口总值的比重由１％升至６０．１％；自１９８５年起，其出口值和就业人数开始双超糖业，被称为“毛里求斯经济史上的转折点”。目前，出口加工区以服装加工业为主，其他还有钟表装配、玩具生产、首饰加工、塑料制品等行业。特别值得称道的是，毛里求斯已跃居为世界第三大毛织品出口国。这对一个不产羊毛的国家来说，不能不说是一大奇迹。
    出口加工区的繁荣深刻改变了毛里求斯的经济面貌。突出表现在：
    ——国家经济实力明显增强。１８年来，国内生产总值年平均增长约６．５％，远高于其他非洲国家；人均国内生产总值翻了近三番，１９８８年估计达１７００美元，在黑非洲列第二位。
    ——经济结构和出口结构发生了根本性变化。在国内生产总值构成中，农业由１９７１年的２５．８％降到１９８８年的１０．６％，同期工业则由１６．５％升至２２．２％。工业已远远超过农业，占据国民经济的主导地位。在出口构成中，蔗糖出口值占国家出口总值的份额从独立初期的９０％以上降到１９８８年的３０．８％，已完全摆脱长期依赖蔗糖出口历史状况。
    ——旅游业取得突破性进展。１８年间，游客和旅游业收入分别由２．７６万人和０．３亿卢比上升到２３万人和２５亿卢比。就游客人数而言，毛里求斯在黑非洲国家中名列第三。
    ——长期困扰政府的失业问题得到解决。出口加工区的兴盛为失业大军创造了数量可观的就业机会，从而基本实现了劳动力“全员就业”。
    上述事实清楚表明，出口加工区的振兴不仅改变了毛里求斯脆弱的单一经济结构，而且也给整个经济注入了活力和生机，促进了经济和社会的发展与进步。
    出口加工区的迅速崛起不是偶发的经济现象，而是诸多有利因素长期交织作用的结果。这些因素主要是：
    ——政治和社会一直保持基本稳定。毛里求斯是多党制国家，独立以来没有发生过政变，政权更迭是通过各党竞选的方式实现的。这种稳定的政治和社会环境，对外国投资者具有极大的吸引力。
    ——国际环境为出口加工区的兴起创造了条件。毛里求斯作为《洛美公约》成员国，其出口加工区产品可免征关税和无配额限制地进入欧共体市场，从而获得了发展外向型经济的最基本条件之一——出口保证市场。
    ——经济发展政策和战略符合本国实际。在经济发展政策上毛里求斯历届政府都主张“混合经济制”，明确宣布对私人企业不实行国有化，并采取各种措施，积极促进私人资本的发展。出口加工区近一半的资本来自本国企业家。
    ——对外资采取了特殊的优惠政策。对出口加工区企业，政府免征机械、设备和零配件进口税；免征生产原材料和半成品进口税与执照税；象征性地征收１５％的公司税；头１０年免征红利所得税；企业资本（含资本增值额）、利润和红利可自由汇出，股票可转让；水电按成本价供应；企业用房用地租金低廉，并少征５０％的注册税；在贷款利率、保险服务、海关检验等方面亦对外资企业实行优惠。这些政策大大激发了海外投资者的欲望和热情，对出口加工区的兴旺起到了决定性作用。
    ——毛里求斯本身拥有发展出口加工区的优越条件。首先，毛里求斯地处欧、亚、非和大洋洲之间的战略要冲，且交通运输、水电供应、邮电通讯、金融服务等经济和社会基础设施比较发达。其次，有一支充足、价廉、素质高的劳动力队伍，能够满足出口加工区对各类雇员的需要。
