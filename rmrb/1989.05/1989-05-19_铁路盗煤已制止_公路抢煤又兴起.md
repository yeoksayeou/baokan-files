The theft of coal from railways has been stopped, but robbery on highways is on the rise.

In Anhui's Huainan Mining Bureau, there are five enterprise-operated dedicated railway lines totaling 180 kilometers in length. By the end of last year, due to the nationwide energy shortage and rising coal prices, some lawless elements brazenly gathered in broad daylight to loot coal from trains. The railway public security department mobilized dozens of officers, along with relevant personnel from local township governments, public security stations, and public order maintenance teams, to investigate households and collaborate in recovering the stolen coal, totaling over 350 tons. Subsequently, relevant departments severely punished some of these lawless elements. In the first quarter of this year, the mine area's railways have been running smoothly without any obstacles, and train operations have been safe, with no theft incidents occurring.

It is worth noting that currently, near the mines of Zhangzhuang, Luling, Yangzhuang, and Daihe, some individuals take advantage of the uneven road surfaces and slow-moving vehicles to shovel and hook coal from coal-carrying trucks using shovels and hooks. On March 15th, I personally witnessed piles of coal on both sides of the highway 18 kilometers north of the mine. Nearly a hundred villagers with carts and iron tools were standing by the roadside, waiting for coal trucks. As a coal-carrying truck approached, they swarmed over it. The driver dared not stop, and the cargo owner lamented in distress.

### 铁路盗煤已制止  公路抢煤又兴起

　　铁路盗煤已制止  公路抢煤又兴起
    在安徽淮北矿务局有５条１８０公里长的企业自营专用铁路线。去年底，由于全国能源紧张，煤价上涨，一些不法分子在光天化日之下聚众哄抢列车上的煤炭。铁路公安部门调集数十名干警，与当地乡镇政府、公安派出所、治保队的有关人员深入农户调查，协同查究，追回煤炭３５０多吨。随后，有关部门严肃处理了一些不法分子。今年第一季度，矿区铁路畅通无阻，列车运行安全，没有发生一起偷盗案件。
    值得注意的是，目前张庄、芦岭、杨庄、岱河等矿附近的公路上，一些人趁路面凸凹不平，汽车行驶缓慢，用铁铲、矿扒钩从运煤的汽车上铲扒煤炭。３月１５日，我亲眼看见在煤矿北面１８公里的公路两旁，堆满了一堆又一堆的煤。近百名村民拉着板车，手持铁铣、扒钩站在公路两旁，等待运煤车辆。一辆运煤卡车开来，他们蜂拥而上。司机不敢停车、货主叫苦不迭。
