Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, May 29th.

A few days ago in the evening, a bottle of "Mountain Hawthorn Honey" wine, just taken out of the refrigerator, suddenly exploded in the home of retired worker Li from Dalian Port, damaging a nearby clock.

Coincidentally, according to a report by the *Dalian Evening News*, in less than three months, more than ten bottles of the same brand of "Mountain Hawthorn Honey" fruit wine have exploded in the homes of Dalian Port workers, with some people sustaining injuries to their hands.

Staff from the Dalian City Product Quality Supervision and Inspection Institute revealed the secret behind the fruit wine turning into "bombs": Before and after the Spring Festival, 190 cases of ordinary bottled "Mountain Hawthorn Honey" fruit wine produced by the Longquan Wine Company in the Dalian Economic and Technological Development Zone had incomplete sterilization. During the storage period, fermentation and spoilage occurred, producing carbon dioxide that exceeded the pressure the glass bottles could withstand, leading to explosions. Recently, Longquan Wine Company has sent personnel to recall the fruit wine with quality issues.

　　果酒成“炸弹”
    据新华社大连５月２９日电  不久前的一天晚上，大连港退休工人李某家有一瓶刚从冰箱中取出的“山枣蜜”酒突然爆炸，将旁边座钟崩坏。
    无独有偶。据《大连晚报》报道，在不到３个月的时间里，大连港职工的家中已有１０余瓶同牌号的“山枣蜜”果酒爆炸，有的人手被崩坏。
    大连市产品质量监督检验所的工作人员揭开了果酒变成“炸弹”的秘密：春节前后，大连开发区龙泉酿酒有限公司生产的１９０箱普通瓶装“山枣蜜”果酒，由于杀菌不彻底，在贮存期内就已发酵变质，产生的二氧化碳含量超过了玻璃瓶所能承受的压力而引起爆炸。日前，龙泉酿酒有限公司已派出人员，追回质量有问题的果酒。
