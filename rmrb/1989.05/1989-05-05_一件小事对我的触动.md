As an old police officer, I have handled many cases, but a recent small incident has deeply touched me, and I have been thinking about it a lot.

On the afternoon of March 16, at around 6 PM, I was riding my motorcycle from the Zhuxian Public Security Bureau into the jurisdiction of Dongchengfang Township in Zhuxian City when a young man, who looked like a farmer, suddenly ran into the middle of the road and stopped me, saying, "Police officer, please help me, I am from Gu'an County..."

Before he could finish, he started to cry.

"What are you doing? Speak properly," I was surprised by his sudden action and immediately stopped the motorcycle. "This morning, I came to Dongchengfang sandpit to buy sand. We agreed on 4 yuan per car, but they insisted on 27 yuan per car. I didn't have that much money, so I said, 'I don't want the sand anymore,' but they wouldn't let me leave and kept my car until now."

As I listened, I thought: How should I handle this matter? Seeing that I didn't speak for a long time, he took out a handful of money from his pocket, both hands holding it up to me.

Seeing this, I felt as if I had been slapped in the face, my face flushed with shame, and I quickly pushed his hand back. I took him to the Dongchengfang sandpit to deal with the matter. After the matter was resolved and we parted ways, he kept saying words of gratitude, but I didn't hear a single word clearly.

I am thinking: The police are the protectors of the people, and the people are the source of the police's livelihood. By rights, when the people encounter difficulties, seeking help from the police is only natural, and it is the duty of the police to help the people solve their problems. But this incident reveals what? I don't know when the once-close relationship between the police and the people has become so distant. Perhaps it is the current social trend of "no money, no justice" that has affected the image of the police in the eyes of the people. Perhaps it is the various corrupt practices that have hurt the people's hearts. I am in deep, painful thought...

### 一件小事对我的触动

　　一件小事对我的触动
    做为一名老民警，我经办过不少案子，但最近经历的一件小事给我很大触动，我为此想了很多。
    ３月１６日下午６时，我从涿州市公安局骑摩托车进入涿州市东城坊乡地界时，一个农民模样的青年突然冲到路当中，将我拦住说：“民警同志，求求您，我是固安县城关的……”话没说完，他就哭了起来。
    “你这是干什么，有话好好讲。”我对他突然拦车感到很吃惊，立即停下车。“早上我来到东城坊沙场拉沙子，说好４元一车，可他们硬要２７元一车。我没有这么多钱，就说：‘不要沙子了’，但他们硬是不让我走，把我的车一直扣到现在。”
    我边听边思考：该如何处理这件事呢？那青年见我半天没说话，从口袋里掏出一把钱，双手捧着送到我的面前。
    面对此情此景，我好像被人重重地打了一记耳光，脸上发烧，急忙把他的手推了回去，带着他去东城坊沙场处理那件事。处理结束后分手时，他不迭地说了许多感恩的话，可我一句也没听清。
    我在想：警察是人民的保护神，人民是警察的衣食父母。按理说，群众遇到为难的事，找警察是天经地义的，警察为人民排忧解难也是义不容辞的职责。但这件事说明了什么？不知从何时起，往日鱼水的警民关系变得如此疏远，也许是时下流行的那种有理没钱办不成事的社会流弊影响了警察在人民群众心目中的形象，也许是时下种种腐败现象刺伤了人民的心，我陷入了深深的、痛苦的思索中…… 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　河北涿州市公安局　孔祥民
