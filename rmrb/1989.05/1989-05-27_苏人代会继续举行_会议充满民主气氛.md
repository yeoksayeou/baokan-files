The First Congress of People's Deputies Continues with a Democratic Atmosphere

	New China News Agency, Moscow, May 26 (Reporter Shen Faliang) The first Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union continued today in the Grand Kremlin Palace. Gorbachev, who was elected as the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet yesterday, presided over this morning's meeting.

	The main agenda for this meeting was to elect the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The representatives spent 2 hours and 20 minutes in heated discussions on the election method for the Union Council, one of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet. The most debated issue was whether the representatives of the Supreme Soviet should be fully or partially detached from their original duties. Many speakers pointed out that many heads of local party and government organizations have been included in the list of 271 candidates for the Union Council. Once elected as representatives of the Supreme Soviet, they would need to spend 8 months a year in Moscow, leaving them with no time to handle local affairs. Despite this, the meeting chairman still used the voting machine to pass the decision that the representatives of the Supreme Soviet should be fully detached from their original duties.

	The meeting was filled with a democratic atmosphere from beginning to end. During the 3-hour debate this morning, 54 people spoke, and the chairman of the meeting also publicly read more than 10 notes submitted by the representatives to the presidium.

　　苏人代会继续举行
    会议充满民主气氛
    新华社莫斯科５月２６日电  （记者沈法良）首届苏联人民代表大会今天在克里姆林宫大会堂继续举行。昨天当选为最高苏维埃主席的戈尔巴乔夫主持了今天上午的会议。
    这次会议的主要议程是选举苏联最高苏维埃。代表们用了２小时２０分钟，对最高苏维埃两院之一——联盟院的选举办法进行了热烈的讨论。争论最多的一个问题是：最高苏维埃代表是完全脱产还是部分脱产？许多发言者指出，不少地方党政机构的第一把手已被列入联盟院２７１名代表候选人的名单，一旦当选为最高苏维埃代表，一年当中要有８个月在莫斯科工作，这些人根本无暇处理地方上的问题。尽管如此，会议主持人还是动用表决机器，通过了最高苏维埃代表完全脱产的决定。
    会议自始至终充满民主气氛，在今天上午历时３个多小时的辩论中，发言者多达５４人，此外，大会主席还当众宣读了代表们递交主席团的１０多张条子。
