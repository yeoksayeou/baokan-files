	“Sigh, these days soldiers don’t know what’s gotten into them, always boasting about how rich their families are.” A certain artillery platoon’s Commander Lei told the author, of their 70-odd soldiers, nearly 50 claimed their families were millionaires, but in reality, there were probably no more than 10 genuine millionaires. A certain regiment’s political department conducted a survey of 200 soldiers, finding that 46% claimed their family’s annual income exceeded 10,000 yuan. After investigation, 80% of these claims were found to be false.

	Just “chatting” might be fine, but the problem is that these self-proclaimed “millionaires” insist on comparing and competing with each other.

	Near a certain regiment’s camp, there is a small restaurant. During holidays, the restaurant’s business is particularly brisk, with customers being exclusively soldiers. Soldiers only receive a few dozen yuan in allowances per month, so this spending doesn’t add up. “They get money from their families,” said Commander Zhao of a certain regiment’s political department to the author. They had statistics showing that during the Spring Festival alone, 430 remittance slips were received, totaling over 20,000 yuan. Soldiers who couldn’t get money from their families would come up with other ways to get it.

	“Poor but boastful,” “poor but generous,” these soldiers who pretend to be wealthy, why do they do it?

	“If you say you’re poor, people will look down on you,” soldier Li Xiaode bluntly stated. A certain platoon’s sergeant told the author, because his family was not wealthy, some soldiers often made fun of him and gave him the nickname “stingy.”

	If soldiers are afraid to admit they are poor for fear of being looked down upon, this fosters the phenomenon of boasting about wealth. However, some platoon leaders’ behavior of “disliking the poor and favoring the rich” undoubtedly adds fuel to the fire. Several soldiers told the author that their platoon leaders usually prefer to associate with soldiers from wealthier families. When opportunities arise, such as learning to drive or joining the party, these soldiers are always given priority.

	Is the “boasting” behind it joy or sorrow?

	Some officers and soldiers believe that boasting about wealth encourages unnecessary waste, fosters soldiers’ vanity, and promotes unhealthy trends within the military, doing more harm than good and should be stopped. Others are indifferent: “Let them boast, what’s the big deal!”

	The author believes that the military should conduct education on the tradition of hard work and thrift, and coordinate with soldiers’ families to prevent soldiers from competing with each other in spending. At the same time, eliminate the phenomenon of leaders favoring the rich and discriminating against the poor.

### 战士夸富现象透视

　　战士夸富现象透视
    “唉，现在的兵不知是咋的了，动不动就吹嘘自己家里怎么怎么富。”某炮连雷连长一脸疑惑地告诉笔者，他们连７０多个兵，自称自己家里是万元户的就有近５０个，而真正的万元户估计超不过１０个。某团政治处曾对２００名战士进行过一次统计，自报家庭年收入超过万元的占４６％，经调查摸底，８０％是“谎报军情”。
    仅仅“侃一侃”倒也罢了，问题在于这些并不实际的“万元户”，却偏要互相攀比。
    某部营区附近有个小饭馆，一到节假日，饭馆的生意格外兴隆，顾客是清一色当兵的。战士一月就那么十几二十来元的津贴，这样花钱不禁让人要问：“钱从哪里来？”
    “向家里要。”某团政治处赵主任告诉笔者，他们曾作过统计，仅今年春节期间就收到４３０份汇款单，计人民币２万多元。有些从家里实在要不出钱的战士，便想歪点子弄钱。
    “穷”侃，“穷”大方，这些硬充好汉的战士，到底为什么？
    “要说穷，就被人瞧不起呗。”战士李小德直言不讳。某连有位中士委屈地告诉笔者，因为他家不富裕，一些战士便经常拿他开玩笑，还给他取了个“老抠”的外号。
    如果说战士之间怕说穷被人瞧不起，滋生了夸富现象，那么，个别连队干部“嫌贫爱富”行为，无疑起着火上加油的作用。几位战士向笔者反映，他们连的干部平常就爱和家庭比较富的战士接近。遇到学司机、入党等机会，这些战士总是受到优先照顾。
    “侃”的背后是喜是忧？
    有些官兵认为，夸富助长了不应有的浪费风，助长了战士的虚荣心，助长了部队的不正之风，有百害而无一利，应该予以制止。也有人对此不以为然：“侃”就让他“侃”去，管那么多干啥！
    笔者认为，应该在部队进行艰苦奋斗的传统教育，并与战士家庭联系，杜绝战士在花钱上互相攀比。同时消除干部中存在的嫌贫爱富现象。
