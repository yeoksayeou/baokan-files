Finland is a country with a population of less than 5 million and an area of just over 330,000 square kilometers in Northern Europe. Since officially joining the International Olympic Committee in 1908, Finland has participated in almost all Summer and Winter Olympic Games, winning a total of 386 medals, including 129 gold medals. This makes Finland a veteran member of the Olympic family with a glorious record.

The secret to Finland's success in sports lies in the country's strong promotion and the personal involvement of its presidents. Of the nine presidents who have held office since 1981, seven are athletes by profession. The current president, Koivisto, has been fond of volleyball since childhood and still participates in national senior competitions despite being over sixty. His predecessor, Kekkonen, won the national high jump championship with a height of 1.85 meters and led the team to participate in multiple Olympic Games. Other presidents also have notable achievements, with some winning the national shooting championship multiple times.

Finland has half of its year covered in ice and snow. The people take advantage of this unique natural environment to frequently engage in activities such as skiing, ice hockey, and ice fishing. In the last Winter Olympics, Finnish athletes won 13 medals, including 4 golds. Currently, more than 20 Finns are playing for professional ice hockey teams in the United States and Canada.

In the past three years, Finland has been actively promoting the "Health Passport" campaign. Participants obtain passport cards from post offices. Holders must have 25 stamps on their cards to prove they have personally participated in various sports activities. This qualifies them for the "Around the World" lottery drawing. Now, more than 300 counties and over 50 community organizations across the country are participating in this activity.

　　芬兰体育欣欣向荣
    芬兰是一个人口不足５００万、面积仅有３３万多平方公里的北欧国家。自１９０８年正式加入国际奥委会后，芬兰几乎参加了所有的夏季和冬季奥运会，共获奖牌３８６枚，其中金牌有１２９个，算得上奥林匹克大家庭中一个战绩辉煌的老资格成员。
    芬兰体育成功的奥秘，首先是国家大力倡导，历届总统身体力行。就拿１９８１年来先后任职的９位总统来说，其中７位是运动员出身。现任总统科伊维斯托自幼喜好排球，年过花甲仍坚持参加全国老年组比赛。他的前任克考农曾以１．８５米的成绩勇夺全国跳高冠军，并多次率队参加奥运会。其他几位总统也不乏卓著战功，有的多次荣获全国射击冠军。
    芬兰每年有一半时间是冰天雪地。人们利用这得天独厚的自然地理条件，经常举行滑雪、冰球和冰上钓鱼等活动。上届冬奥会上，芬兰健儿就获１３枚奖牌，其中４枚为金质。目前为美国和加拿大职业冰球队效力的芬兰人就达２０多名。
    最近三年，芬兰一直在开展“健康护照”活动。参加者从邮局领取护照卡片。持照者须在卡片上加盖２５颗印章，证明亲自参加了有关各项体育运动。由此即可获“周游世界”彩票的抽奖资格。现在，全国有３００多个县和５０多个群众组织参加了这项活动。
