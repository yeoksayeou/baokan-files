Jiangsu Begins Development of Lvsi Port

    A port that has been dormant for thousands of years—Jiangsu Province's Lvsi Port—is showing broad prospects for development in the context of the coastal economic development strategy.

    Known as the "Pearl of the Yellow Sea," Lvsi Port is located on the Yellow Sea coast in the northwestern part of Qidong County. It is an important fishing base and one of the four major fishing grounds in China. Marine aquaculture has developed rapidly in recent years. Just in the shrimp industry alone, over 300 tons are exported annually. In terms of seafood processing, the port area already has 43 refrigerated warehouses, with a daily freezing capacity of 505 tons, and a seafood preservation rate of 98%. So far, several countries and regions have established business ties with Lvsi.

    According to the Xinhua Daily, recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Government approved the establishment of a docking point for small Taiwanese vessels at Lvsi Port, and has allocated funds to build the province's first reception center for Taiwanese fishermen. At the same time, a small-scale trade warehouse for cross-strait trade has been established.

    Lvsi Port has deep and wide waters, stable dynamic channels, minimal siltation, and natural windbreaks, with excellent conditions for river-sea transport. It is one of the few natural deep-water ports in China that can accommodate vessels of over 50,000 tons, as confirmed by experts. The Nanjing Water Science Institute conducted a feasibility study on the port construction conditions, which passed the review at the end of last year. The superior conditions for port construction and development at Lvsi have also attracted the attention of foreign experts and businessmen. Experts believe that building a deep-water port at Lvsi will create a north-south complementary situation with Lianyungang Port, which is necessary for revitalizing the economy of northern Jiangsu. The South Yellow Sea basin has oil reserves of over 200 million tons, and Lvsi Port is ideally located near the South Yellow Sea basin, making it an ideal base for oil development. Developing Lvsi Port can also avoid the constraints of the Longjiang sandbar on the entry and exit of large vessels into the Yangtze River, providing conditions for Shanghai Port to divert traffic, and forming a comprehensive and rationally laid-out Eastern Great Port Group with Shanghai Port and Ningbo Port in Zhejiang.

　　江苏着手开发吕四港    
    可与上海港北仑港形成布局合理的大港群体
    本报讯  沉睡千年的天然良港——江苏省吕四港，在沿海地区经济发展战略中展示出广阔的开发前景。
    素有“黄海明珠”美称的吕四港，位于启东县西北部的黄海岸边，是我国重要的渔业基地、全国四大渔场之一。海水养殖近几年也迅速发展，仅对虾一项，每年出口３００吨以上。在渔品加工方面，港区已有大小冷库４３座，日速冻能力５０５吨，水产品保鲜率已达９８％。到目前为止，已有几个国家和地区与吕四发生业务联系。
    据新华日报报道，不久前，江苏省政府批准在吕四港建立台湾小型船舶停泊点，已拨款正在建设全省第一家台湾渔民接待站，同时还建立了对台小额贸易货栈。
    吕四港水域深而宽广，水道动态稳定，微冲不淤，并有天然的挡风屏障，江河海联运条件十分优越，是被专家们确定的我国沿海少有的可建５万吨以上深水泊位的天然良港。南京水科院进行了建港条件可行性研究，去年底通过论证。吕四优越的建港条件及开发利用，也引起了国外专家和客商的关注。专家们认为：兴建吕四深水大港，将与连云港形成南北呼应的局面，是振兴苏北经济的需要；南黄海盆地石油储量在２亿吨以上，吕四港紧靠南黄海盆地，是最理想的石油开发基地，开发吕四港，同时可以避开长江拦门沙对大型海轮进出长江的制约，为上海港分流提供了条件，可与上海港、浙江北仑港形成一个功能齐全、布局合理的东方大港群体。
