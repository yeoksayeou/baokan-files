The New Secretary

In late 1985, 33-year-old Luo Guoxing was transferred to become the Secretary of the Guang'an County Committee in Sichuan Province.

The burden on his shoulders was heavy! The Guang'an in front of Luo Guoxing had an average income of 196 yuan per person, and households with an income of 200 yuan or less accounted for 72.5% of the total. Many families had not yet solved the problem of basic sustenance. It was a truly impoverished county.

"New Secretary!" The common people of Guang'an were discussing and hoping...

The "Pressure Cooker" Retiree Center

"The new secretary is very young, only 33 years old!" The old cadres in the county committee retiree center started discussing. There were expressions of envy, anticipation, sighs, and silence, all kinds of emotions.

County Committee Advisor Xie Shiqing was one of those who remained silent. This old county magistrate from the 1950s knew Guang'an County inside out, and there was hardly a corner he was unfamiliar with. What he never expected was that the new county committee secretary visited him on the very first day of his arrival. During their conversation, they talked about the economy, education, and talent.

Guang'an County has 180 retired cadres. Most of them were removed from their leadership positions during the 1983 institutional reforms. If you ask about the county's situation, they could all describe it in intricate detail; if you ask about their energy, many of them were still in good physical condition and could handle tough work for a couple of years. However, the mood of most of them was not high, and apart from gossiping behind the backs of the frontline cadres, they were reluctant to interact with them, as if they were harboring a lot of resentment.

Before Luo Guoxing arrived in Guang'an, he had heard that Guang'an had a retiree center known as the "pressure cooker," which was quite troublesome. With a hundred or so people, this was a valuable resource. "Pressure" couldn't it be transformed into the "energy" to drive Guang'an forward? Luo Guoxing and the county committee members were looking for the root of the problem: insufficient respect and utilization of cadres who had not yet reached retirement age. The old cadres wanted to see Guang'an prosper, but the situation in Guang'an was stagnant, how could they not be frustrated?

At the standing committee meeting, Luo Guoxing earnestly said: "The old cadres have contributed half their lives; they are the meritorious people of Guang'an. We should be sincere in our feelings, diligent in our work, and solve problems that can be solved with policies as a priority."

Hengsheng Town is located in the most remote mountainous area of Guang'an. After retiring from his position at the town grain station, the cadre Zhao Wanchang stayed at home, never expecting any leader to visit him to inquire about his well-being. But Luo Guoxing insisted on visiting. Old Zhao had an injured leg and had difficulty walking, so Luo Guoxing and the town leaders helped him solve his living difficulties together.

The old cadres' activity room had been under construction for two or three years but was still incomplete. A hundred or so people had nowhere to go, and complaints were abundant. Luo Guoxing conducted on-site inspections with relevant comrades, and the activity room quickly broke ground...

New and Old Hearts United to Prosper Guang'an

One thing after another. Especially Luo Guoxing's plan to revitalize Guang'an with energy and transportation as the main focus, everything was solid.

"This young man is here to do business; Guang'an has hope!"

"In the past, I didn't dare to do it while in power; later, I wanted to do it but didn't have the chance. Now I can't complain anymore. Ask Luo Guoxing for something to do, even if I can't do much, being a consultant is also a way to contribute."

"The 'pressure cooker' is not a good nickname; we should give ourselves a new name. Use actions to turn this retiree center into a 'senate.'"

The old cadres were excited and passionate, talking enthusiastically. They studied Luo Guoxing's plan item by item.

The Liangtan Hydropower Station is a major project. Luo Guoxing and the standing committee members were troubled by the lack of a commander who was both knowledgeable and had management experience. The "senate" stepped in and recommended County Government Advisor Ouyu Rong. He was an "old hydropower expert" and still in good health. After careful consideration, the county committee and county government also agreed that he was the most suitable candidate. Being able to contribute to Guang'an's hydropower construction was also the happiest thing for Ouyu Rong. He took on the role of the party secretary of the Liangtan Power Station Engineering Command Department, spending three consecutive Spring Festivals in the construction site. Ouyu Rong and his colleagues in the engineering command department submitted a beautiful "report card." The power station was completed half a year ahead of schedule, saving 700,000 yuan and generating an additional 100,000 yuan in revenue.

While the "generals" were fighting left and right, the "strategists" in the "senate" were not to be outdone.

The county's market management was chaotic. Old cadres Huang Zhengkun and Jie Song, among others, conducted multiple on-site investigations and submitted more than ten suggestions to the county committee and county government for strengthening market management. The county government, following their advice, conducted a comprehensive rectification of the market, and the market's appearance was transformed.

The county's match factory was poorly managed. Old cadre Chen Zhijiang led a group of old comrades to stay in the factory for two months, submitting a detailed investigation report to the factory and the county industrial bureau, providing a reliable basis for the rectification of the match factory.

"Luo Guoxing is worthy of the 'senate,' and we must be worthy of him." Xie Shiqing told us a moving story when he talked about the role of old cadres: In 1987, based on public reports, the county committee dealt with several cadres who had used their positions for personal gain. This touched the nerves of some leaders in the municipal committee. They asked Luo Guoxing to show some leniency, but Luo Guoxing still firmly dealt with the issue. When the public applauded, Luo Guoxing was facing pressure from above. The "senate" knew and 84 old cadres at home jointly wrote a letter to Luo Guoxing: "You are on the right path, for the future of Guang'an. If there is a lawsuit, we will accompany you to the ends of the earth without fear."

Guang'an is becoming prosperous. Last year, the county's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 467 million yuan, and the per capita income in rural areas was 322 yuan.

Of course, the unity of new and old cadres is not the only reason for Guang'an's progress. But here, it is indeed permeated with the blood and sweat of the old cadres.

　　罗国兴和他的“参议院”
    本报记者  吴学林  龚金星
    “新来的书记”
    １９８５年底，３３岁的罗国兴调任四川省广安县委书记。
    肩上的担子重啊！罗国兴面前的广安，人均收入１９６元，全县收入２００元以下的农户占总户数的７２．５％，有不少人家连温饱问题还未解决。一个地地道道的贫困县。
    “新来的书记！”广安的平头百姓议论着、巴望着……
    “气压锅炉”退休院
    “新来的书记，很年轻呐，才３３岁！”县委退休院里的老干部议论开了，羡慕、期待、唉声叹气，默不作声，各种表情应有尽有。
    县委顾问谢世清是默不作声的一个。这位５０年代的老县长，满肚子广安县情，可以说没有哪个角落不熟悉。最使他想不到的是，新来的县委书记到任的头一天就登门拜访他。交谈中，他们谈经济，话科教，议人才。
    广安县离退休干部有１８０多人。他们中，多数是１９８３年机构改革时从领导岗位上退下来的。要说县情，他们谁都能道出几个曲里拐弯来；要说精力，不少人身体还真棒，就是摸爬滚打也能挺两年。然而，他们中多数人的情绪并不高，对于一线的干部除了背后说三道四外，还真不愿打交道，好像心中窝着一肚子火。
    罗国兴还未到广安，就听说广安有个老干部集中的退休院，有“气压锅炉”之称，难弄得很。百八十号人，这是一笔难得的财富。“气”，难道就不能转化为推动广安的“能”吗？罗国兴和县委常委寻找着问题的症结：对未到退休年龄的老同志尊重不够，发挥作用不够。老同志一心想看到广安的振兴，而广安的局面总是徘徊，怎能没有“气”？
    常委会上，罗国兴恳切地说：“老同志贡献了大半辈子，是广安的有功之臣。对老同志，我们应该感情上不掺假，工作上不怠慢，政策上允许又能解决的问题，就要优先解决。”
    恒升镇，地处广安最偏远的山区。南下干部赵万昌从镇粮站岗位上退下来后，猫在家里，从来就不曾想过会有哪位领导上门问个冷暖。可罗国兴硬是来了。老赵的腿有伤，行走不便，罗国兴和镇领导一起帮他解决了衣食起居的困难。
    老干部活动室，修了两三年，还不见半截墙，百八十号人没个出处，意见天大。罗国兴与有关同志现场办公，活动室很快就破土动工了……
    新老同心兴广安
    一件件实事。特别是罗国兴的那套以发展能源交通为主体的振兴广安规划，项项实在。
    “这小伙子是来干事业的，广安有希望！”
    “过去在位时，没敢干；后来想干，没机会。如今可不能再抱怨了。找罗国兴要点事干，别的不行，当个参谋也算尽了一片心。”
    “‘气压锅炉’不是个好外号，还是给自己正名吧。用行动把这退休院变成‘参议院’。”
    老同志们七嘴八舌，兴奋、激昂。说干就干。他们把罗国兴送来的规划，逐项研究。
    凉滩水电站，是一项大工程。罗国兴和常委们正为找不到一位既懂行又有管理经验的指挥者而苦恼。“参议院”参议了，推荐县政府顾问欧儒荣。他是位“老水电”，身体还结实得很。县委、县政府经仔细权衡，也认为他是最合适的人选。能为广安的水电建设贡献余热，对欧儒荣来说，也是最幸福的事。他挑起了凉滩电站工程指挥部党委书记的担子，一钻进工地，一连三个春节工棚里过。欧儒荣和工程指挥部的伙伴们交了一份漂亮的“答卷”。电站提前半年竣工，节资７０多万元，提前发电增收１００多万元。
    当“将才”们左冲右突干得欢时，“参议院”里的“谋士”们也不示弱。
    县城市场管理混乱。黄正坤、解松等几位老同志，多次深入实地调查，给县委、县政府提出了加强市场管理的十多项建议。县政府按照他们的意见，对市场进行了综合治理，市场面貌焕然一新。
    县火柴厂管理混乱。老同志陈志江带着一帮老伙伴，在厂里蹲了两个月，向该厂和县工业局送报了一份详细的调查报告，为火柴厂的整顿提供了可靠的依据。
    “罗国兴对得起‘参议院’，我们也要对得起他。”谢世清讲老同志作用时给我们讲了一件感人肺腑的事：１９８７年，根据群众举报，县委处理了几位利用职权谋取私利的干部。这下触动了地委某些部门的头头。他们让罗国兴抬抬手，但罗国兴还是坚决处理了。当群众拍手称快时，罗国兴却承受着来自上边的压力，“参议院”知道后，在家的８４名老同志联名写信给罗国兴：“你走的路是对的，是为了广安的前途，如果要打官司，我们陪你走遍天涯海角也不怕。”
    广安在富。去年，全县工农业总产值达４．６７亿，农村人均收入３２２元。
    当然，新老干部同心同德，不是广安前进的唯一原因。但这里确实浸透着老同志的心血和汗水。
