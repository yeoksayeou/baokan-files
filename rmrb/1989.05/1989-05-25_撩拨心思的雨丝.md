In the face of these eager faces, what should one say?

In the midst of the "ten billion people, nine billion merchants" wave, these people still have the heart to come to the foot of Huangshan to study "literature." While admiring them, there is also some confusion. Not to mention whether they have written any immortal works, these "elite" of the railway system, including secretaries, teachers, drivers, telephone operators, and personnel officers, as well as propaganda cadres, work hard for eight hours a day, and then write under the lamp at night. Like those who have become obsessed with Buddhism, they torment themselves. If they had just a bit of this hardworking spirit for officialdom or speculation in the circulation sector, they would have long been some kind of director or a millionaire, a ten-millionaire... Looking at them, so poor, why bother? Coming to the foot of Huangshan, writing during the day and revising at night, tormenting themselves. And that early rain, falling day and night without stopping, making one irritable.

In the face of these eager faces, what should one say? The highest realm of literature is without technique. Like Buddhism, the most brilliant person cannot master it completely, and ordinary people can also become enlightened...

The annoying plum rain keeps falling. These poor ordinary people, under the tyranny of the rain, improve their spiritual lives by chatting. When chatting, they are the opposite of their gentle and modest selves when writing, deeply detesting those who speculate on material goods; they gnash their teeth at those who suddenly become spiritual tycoons. Their spit could almost drown those "monsters"! They chat about creation, and come up with astonishing images—a mediocre female editor, who offers her most precious thing to the powerful, quickly rises to become a director, an editorial committee member, a deputy editor-in-chief, and a council member. After being wrapped in gold and silver and covered with jewels, she completely changes from her former mediocrity and the simplicity of a country girl, waving her hand at people and opening her mouth to scold people. She is like a "steel woman"...

The image of the "steel woman" was immediately annotated with "black talk": livestock (promotion)—livestock (promotion)—livestock. Then someone added with Buddhist language: sins from a past life.

It's late at night, and the rain is still pattering. Thinking about climbing Huangshan tomorrow, the more one tries to fall asleep, the more one's mind races. Perhaps it's too quiet, the pattering of the rain seems to turn into the enthusiastic chatting. The six-character annotation, plus the "sins from a past life," is something to savor. How can there be such people in the world? This image far surpasses the imagination of a writer...

The more one tries to fall asleep, the less one wants to. The imagination keeps surging with the sound of the rain in the heart and mind. Tomorrow, we will take the cable car up the mountain. Before coming, my wife repeatedly warned: "Don't take the cable car, what if the cable breaks..." What if? What if the cable car on Huangshan really breaks like the cable car on the Alps in the TV screen, what should one do? Terrible, too terrible. Should one write a will first? Fear what? Ridiculous, a "baggage-free" person with no gold, silver, or spiritual and physical burdens, comes and goes without any attachments.

What if those "livestock" encounter that "what if" on the cable car? Would they regret losing their most precious thing for their past life's sins? Or would they be proud of their current glory? Ha, in the face of "what if," such people's hearts must be the most uncomfortable! What kind of feeling? One can only ask the author tomorrow. Perhaps that person is writing a brilliant novel about "her" under the lamp. What will be the ending of the novel? Ah! Quickly sleep, why worry about others' business?!

The raindrops that stir the mind, please stop!

　　撩拨心思的雨丝
    刘贵贤
    面对这一张张期待的脸，说些什么呢？
    在“十亿人民九亿商”的“大潮”中，这些人还有心思跑到这黄山脚下念“文学经”，钦佩之余，有几分迷惑。且不说他们写出了什么传世之作，这些铁路的“精英”，有秘书，教师，司机，电话员，还有人事干部，宣传干事。平日里，班上八个小时辛辛苦苦，班后又在灯下伏案笔耕。就像迷上佛门的弟子，走火入魔。如果，如果把这种辛苦的精神匀出一点点，或钻营官场，或投机于流通领域，早该是什么长或是万元户、十万元户了……看一个个穷兮兮的，何苦哩，来到这黄山脚下，白天写，晚上改，自己折磨自己。偏偏那早到的霉雨，整天整夜的下个不停，叫人心烦。
    面对这一张张渴望的脸，讲些什么呢？文学的最高境界，是无技巧。就像佛学，绝顶聪明的人，不能把它学尽，凡夫俗子，也能成佛……
    令人心烦的梅雨，不停的下。穷兮兮的凡夫俗子在雨的淫威下，自我改善精神生活——侃大山。侃起来，一反写稿时的温良恭俭让，对物质上的官倒，深恶痛绝；对精神上的暴发户，咬牙切齿。唾沫星子恨不能把那些“怪物”淹死！侃的是创作，侃出了令人咂舌的形象——一个平平庸庸的女编辑，向权贵献出了最宝贵的，不日青云直上，又是主任，又是编委，又是副编审，又是理事。金银裹身、珠宝罩顶后，一反往日的平庸和更往日的村姑的朴实，挥手?人，张口训人。俨然一个“钢女人”……“钢女人”的形象一问世，马上有人以“黑话”注释：牲畜（升处）——畜牲（处升）——牲口。随之又有人以佛语补充：前世造孽。
    夜深了，雨还是淅淅沥沥的下。想着明天要登黄山，越是强迫入睡脑子越是轰轰作响。兴许是太静了，那淅淅沥沥的雨声，仿佛变成那热烈兴奋的侃声。六个字的注释，加上那“前世造孽”，令人回味无穷。世上怎么还有这样的人呢？这形象远远超过了作家的想象……
    越想入睡，越不想睡。那想象越是随着雨声在心底波动，在脑际奔腾。明天上山要乘缆车，临来前，妻一再嘱：千万别坐缆车，万一索道断了……万一？万一黄山上的缆车真的像电视屏幕上出现的阿尔卑斯山索道崩断的惨景，该怎么办？可怕，太可怕了。要不要先写份遗嘱。怕什么，笑话，无金无银无灵与肉的“包袱”，赤条条来去无牵挂的俗子，最不怕那万一。
    万一，万一那样的“牲口”们乘缆车遇上那万一，该是什么心情呢？为前世造孽、失去最宝贵的而懊悔？还是为现世的赫赫威风而自豪？呵，在万一面前，那样的人的心里该最不是滋味儿！什么滋味儿，只好等明天问那位作者。兴许，那位在挑灯夜战，把“她”写成一篇精彩的小说哩。小说的结局是什么样子呢？唉！快快睡吧，替别人操的哪门子心？！
    撩拨心思的雨丝，快快停住吧！
