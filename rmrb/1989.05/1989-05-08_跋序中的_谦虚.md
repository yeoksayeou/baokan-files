Title: Humility in Epilogues

The phrase "Books are the ladder of human progress" by Maxim Gorky has been deeply ingrained in my memory since my high school days. Browsing in bookstores has long been one of my pleasures. Now, with open-shelf bookstores, I can leisurely select books each month with my book and newspaper allowance, flipping through them with delight. Sometimes, on a whim, I can't help but start reading right there by the shelf. After a while, the alert shop assistant discovers this "free-reader," of course, the "free-reader" is not as lucky as the "free-eater" or "free-taker," the outcome is quite embarrassing and humiliating.

As the saying goes, "Everyone has their own tricks," since open-shelf selection doesn't allow for a quick glance or flipping through pages, I focus on reading the preface, epilogue, and table of contents, using these three parts to judge my purchase. Over time, I've developed an affection for epilogues, especially the almost uniform humility model authors use in the preface or epilogue, which has left a deep impression on me. I've copied down two examples to share with readers.

"The book, due to the rushed selection time and lack of experience, although I have done my best, still feels there are many shortcomings, omissions, and errors that are inevitable. Please criticize and correct."

"Due to our limited level and resources, the book's views and statements must have many contradictions. I hope readers will criticize and correct."

Every time I read this part, my thoughts wander. Who says we "scholars disparage each other"? So many experts and scholars are so humble!

However, my simple mind wonders, why, if the book authors "feel there are many shortcomings and even errors," don't they revise it to correct the shortcomings and errors before publishing? Since they know "the book's views and statements must have many contradictions," why don't they correct them instead of perpetuating the errors? Someone might blame me for not understanding the humility in front of the phrases "due to rushed time" and "limited level." But stubborn me is still confused. Since "time is rushed," why not publish later when there is more time? Since the "level is limited," why insist on publishing a book with "many contradictions" that misleads people? I naively think, could it be that the author is short on money and needs the manuscript fee, or is eager for fame to quickly get a job title? However, I also feel conflicted. Authors are like teachers, worthy of being called "engineers of the human soul," and are certainly not gold worshippers who would mislead others for a few dollars. Besides, the publisher wouldn't easily let a book with errors out, unless the author bribes them, which is another matter. So, I think, perhaps the authors' humility is just a posture and not necessarily that they truly believe there are many "omissions" and "contradictions."

However, while flipping through epilogues, I sometimes come across a few authors who are not humble, saying, "I believe this book is the most worth reading compared to other similar books"; "Although this book cannot be called elegant and beautiful, I believe it is free from the flaws of verbosity and awkwardness and the defects of obscurity and ambiguity" ... too arrogant! However, "checking the background," fortunately, these authors are basically foreigners, with an occasional Chinese. From this, it seems that our Chinese nation's spirit of humility is much stronger than that of foreigners.

But for some reason, I, who have always admired humility, gradually became anxious as I read more authors' humility in epilogues, nervously fearing the authors' "contradictions" and "errors" in the book. With my not yet mature analytical and reasoning abilities, I fear I might take the errors in the book as truths and mistakes as correct; I am even more afraid of passing on errors, harming myself and others. In my fear, I actually started to like those books by authors who are "not humble" in their epilogues. Because at least there is one point, I can eliminate these spiritual anxieties.

Of course, humility is an indispensable virtue, "humility is the foundation of virtue." However, I feel that the authors' humility in epilogues may be misplaced, a bit too humble and insincere. Therefore, I suggest that if the book indeed has errors as the author says, it is better to correct them before publishing; if it is just to promote our national spirit of humility, it is better to choose a different time and place.

### 跋序中的“谦虚”

　　跋序中的“谦虚”
    潘淑生
    “书是人类进步的阶梯”这句高尔基名言，在中学时代于我就刻骨铭心了。在书店里寻觅，早已成了我的享受。现在有开架书店，每月怀揣数十元书报费，到书架上悠悠然地挑选，乐滋滋地翻阅。有时心血来潮，情不自禁地低头在书架旁看了起来。时间一长，机警的店员发现了我这个“白看”先生，当然“白看”先生不如“白吃”“白拿”先生那样幸运，结局是够尴尬和寒碜的。
    俗话说，王八、虾子各有绝招，既然开架选书，不让走马观花，逐页翻阅，我便重点浏览序言、后记、目录，据此三处权衡选购。久而久之，笔者对跋序有了感情，尤其是作者在前言或后记中几乎千篇一律的谦虚模式，印象颇深，笔者摘抄二则以飨读者。
    “……本书由于选编时间仓促，外加经验不足，虽尽力而为，仍觉有许多不足之处，疏漏乃至错误在所难免，请读者批评指正。”
    “……由于我们水平和资料有限，本书的观点、提法定有很多悖谬之处，企望读者批评指正。”
    每当笔者翻阅此处时，浮想联翩。谁说我们“文人相轻”呀，这么多专家、学者不都是这么谦虚吗！
    然而，我这笨拙的脑瓜，转念寻思，暗自发问，既然书作者们“仍觉有许多不足乃至错误之处”，为什么不修改一番，把不足乃至错误之处纠正过来，非要著作带“病”出版不可呢？既然知晓“本书的观点、提法定有很多悖谬之处”，为什么不拨正过来仍要以讹传讹呢？可能有人责怪笔者未看清“谦虚”之言前的定语“由于时间仓促，水平有限”之故。但执拗的笔者，还是迷惑不解，既然“时间仓促”，为什么不晚一点出版，等时间充裕呢？既然“水平有限”，为什么非要出版这本“定有悖谬”之书，误人子弟不可呢？笔者幼稚地暗自思忖，莫非作者缺钱花了急于拿点稿酬，或是急于成名，好快点评职称？然而笔者又自感矛盾，作者们如同教师一般，堪称“人类灵魂的工程师”，绝非拜金主义者，为了几个钱而贻误他人。再者，出版社也不会轻易让藏有谬误之书出笼吧，除非作者行贿，则另当别论。所以，笔者又虑，作者们之所以这般谦虚，或许也只是一种姿态，未必真认为有多少“疏漏”、“悖谬”。
    不过笔者在翻阅跋序中，有时也偶尔发现几个不谦虚的作者，竟说“本书我自信与其他同类书相比，是一本最值得一看的书”；“本书虽然谈不上什么华章丽句，但自信尚无冗长拗口之弊和朦胧晦涩之嫌”……也太狂妄了！不过，“查查来头”，值得庆幸的是这些作者基本上是外国人，偶尔也有个把炎黄子孙。由此看来，我们中华民族的谦虚精神要比外国人强多了。
    可是，不知怎的，我这个一贯赞赏谦虚的人，随着看多了跋序中作者的谦虚劲，渐渐有些诚惶诚恐了，神经质地害怕起作者书中“悖谬之处，错误之处”，凭笔者分析思辨能力尚不成熟的脑瓜，别把书中谬误当真理，错误为正确；更恐怕自己以讹传讹，害己又害人。惊恐之余，反过来，倒喜欢起那些在跋序中“不谦虚”作者的书。因为起码有一点，我可以消除这些精神恐慌之苦。
    当然，谦虚是不可缺少的品德，“虚己者进德之基”。不过笔者感到跋序中作者的谦虚是否放错了位置，未免有点过谦、虚伪了。为此，笔者认为，如果书中确实存在着如作者所言的错误之处，建议还是斧正后再出版为上策；倘若只是想发扬我们民族的谦虚美德，还是换个时机和地点为好。
