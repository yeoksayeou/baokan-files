This year, wheat pests and diseases are severe, and it is predicted that autumn grain and cotton pests and diseases will also be more prevalent. Additionally, pesticide supply is tight, making pest control difficult and the task heavy. The State Council places great importance on pest control work. For this reason, the National Plant Protection Station of the Ministry of Agriculture has set up three hotline telephones, requiring local authorities to quickly, timely, and accurately report the occurrence of pests and diseases and the supply and demand of pesticides in their areas. This will facilitate the State Council's unified allocation of pesticides to support pest control work.

The reporting of rice should focus on the rice green leafhopper, rice stem borer, rice leaf roller, rice blast, rice sheath blight, and rice tungro virus. The reporting of corn should focus on the corn borer, migratory locusts, and armyworms. The reporting of cotton should focus on the red spider mite, cotton bollworm, cotton aphid, cotton bollworm, and cotton fleahopper.

Reporting will begin at the end of May. The telephone numbers are: Beijing 595146, 5003584, 5003579.
