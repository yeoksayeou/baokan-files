In response to various incidents of retaliation against informants that have occurred in different regions, Zhang Siquan, Vice Prosecutor-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, has demanded that procuratorial organs at all levels thoroughly investigate and take effective measures to protect citizens' legitimate rights to report wrongdoings.

Zhang Siquan said in an interview today that since the establishment of reporting centers by procuratorial organs at all levels nationwide, some of those reported have not only refused to confess their crimes but have also resorted to various means to retaliate against the informants.

The Supreme People's Procuratorate's reporting center has provided materials indicating that, according to incomplete statistics from 15 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, including Henan, Zhejiang, Liaoning, and Beijing, there have been 64 such incidents, with 82 informants subjected to retaliation. Among them, 2 were killed, 3 were illegally detained, 13 were injured, and 64 were either suspended from work, had their salaries withheld, were dismissed from their jobs, demoted, expelled from the Party, or placed on probation within the Party.

Zhang Siquan introduced that procuratorial organs at all levels have paid great attention to incidents of retaliation against informants and have taken decisive action to investigate and prosecute them once discovered. Of the 64 cases currently under investigation, 12 have been found to constitute crimes and have been handled according to law, including one case resulting in a death sentence; 34 cases that do not constitute crimes have been referred to relevant departments for handling; and 18 cases are still under investigation.

He pointed out that currently, there are still some difficulties and obstacles in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving retaliation against informants. The most prominent issue is that, after investigations confirm that retaliation has occurred but no crime has been constituted, the procuratorial organs' suggestions for handling the case are not implemented by the relevant departments, or the handling is delayed. Some even protect the reported individuals. In Henan Province, there have been 18 such cases, accounting for 81.8% of all retaliation cases in the province. Therefore, Zhang Siquan hopes that relevant departments will seriously handle such cases and protect the legal rights of informants.

　　报复举报人案件屡有发生    
    高检负责人要求有关部门坚决查办
    据新华社北京５月１１日电（记者周立宪、实习生杨兴国）针对各地发生的一些打击报复举报人事件，最高人民检察院副检察长张思卿要求各级检察机关认真查处，采取有力措施，保护公民举报的正当权利。
    张思卿今天在接受记者采访时指出，全国各级检察机关设立举报中心以来，一些被举报者不但没有坦白自首，反而采取各种手段，打击报复举报人。
    高检举报中心对此提供材料，据河南、浙江、辽宁、北京等１５个省、自治区、直辖市的不完全统计，已发生６４起此类事件，８２名举报人受到打击报复。其中被杀害的２人，非法拘禁的３人，受伤的１３人，被停止工作、停发工资、开除公职、撤职、开除党籍和留党察看的６４人。
    张思卿介绍说，各级检察机关对打击报复举报人事件十分重视，一经发现，坚决查办。已掌握的６４起案件，对１２起构成犯罪的进行了依法处理，其中判处死刑１人；对没有构成犯罪的３４起，检察机关已转请有关部门处理；还有１８起正在调查中。
    他指出，当前查处打击报复举报人案件还存在一些困难和阻力，突出的是，经调查确属打击报复而又未构成犯罪的，检察机关提出处理意见后，有关部门查处不力，或迟迟不作处理。有的甚至庇护被举报者，河南省就发生１８起这类案件，占全省打击报复案件的８１．８％。为此，张思卿希望有关部门认真处理这类案件，保护举报人的合法权益。
