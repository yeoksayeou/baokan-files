    Fish oil is an effective food for preventing cardiovascular diseases, according to Professor Ernst of the Hannover Medical School in West Germany. He believes that consuming the correct dosage of Omega-3 fatty acids can effectively prevent cardiovascular diseases.

    In a recent research report, Professor Ernst pointed out that the incidence of myocardial infarction among Eskimos is significantly lower than among Europeans. This is because Eskimos consume an average of 14 grams of non-saturated Omega-3 fatty acids from their diet daily. Extensive surveys, animal experiments, and the first batch of clinical trials have also confirmed this view.

    Ernst suggests adopting a diet that replaces a series of saturated fatty acids with non-saturated fatty acids to prevent arteriosclerosis. Such a diet should contain approximately 1 gram of fish oil daily. Eating fish three times a week can provide the necessary amount of fish oil. However, he believes that consuming cod liver oil is not appropriate.

　　鱼油可预防心血管病
    新华社波恩５月１８日电  西德汉诺威医科学院恩斯特教授认为，鱼油是防止心血管疾病的有效食物，按正确剂量服用奥米伽—３脂肪酸，可以有效地预防心血管疾病。
    恩斯特教授最近在一份研究报告里指出，爱斯基摩人中患心肌梗塞者明显少于欧洲人，因为爱斯基摩人平均每天从食物中吸取非饱和奥米伽—３脂肪酸１４克。大量调查和动物试验以及第一批临床试验也证实了这种看法。
    恩斯特建议采用以非饱和脂肪酸代替一系列饱和脂肪酸的饮食，来预防动脉硬化症，这种饮食每天大约含有１克鱼油。每星期吃３次鱼就可以获得必需的鱼油。但他认为吃鱼肝油是不合适的。
