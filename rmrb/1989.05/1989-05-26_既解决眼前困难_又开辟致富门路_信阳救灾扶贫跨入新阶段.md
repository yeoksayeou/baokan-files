The disaster relief and poverty alleviation work in the impoverished areas of XinYang, Henan Province, has entered a new stage of regional economic development from the previous phase of scattered relief. The old disaster-stricken areas have seen economic development and stable living conditions, with 85.2% of impoverished households having escaped poverty.

Located in the Dabie Mountains, XinYang has historically been plagued by frequent natural disasters, and in recent years, it has suffered severe droughts. To fundamentally solve the problem of people's subsistence, local governments and civil affairs departments have changed the traditional method of pure relief. They have concentrated disaster relief funds and materials to support the people in developing productive activities. They have tailored their approach to local conditions, leveraging local resources and technological capabilities. In the Dabie Mountains, they have developed tea, fruit, silkworms, and livestock. In the plains, they have developed grain, waterfowl, and agricultural by-product processing, gradually forming different regional economic advantages and achieving significant economic and social benefits. Taking the waterfowl breeding industry as an example, it has now developed to 6.2 million birds, establishing 8 down processing plants and a number of feed mills, roast duck factories, and preserved egg processing plants. The development of this industry has fully utilized the vast water areas and surplus labor resources in the region, providing a path to poverty alleviation and prosperity for the masses. Currently, XinYang's impoverished areas have initially formed several pillar industries, including grain, hemp, waterfowl, tea, forestry, and weaving.

　　既解决眼前困难　又开辟致富门路
    信阳救灾扶贫跨入新阶段
    据新华社郑州５月２５日电  （记者刘云莱）河南省信阳贫困地区救灾扶贫工作，已从单纯的分散救济转向区域性经济开发的新阶段。多年的老灾区出现了经济不断发展、群众生活安定的繁荣景象，已有８５．２％的贫困户脱贫。
    位于大别山区的信阳地区历史上自然灾害频繁，近几年连续遭受严重旱灾。为从根本上解决群众的温饱问题，当地政府和民政部门改变单纯救济的传统办法，集中救灾扶贫款项和物资，扶持群众搞开发性生产，他们因地制宜，根据当地资源优势、技术条件，在大别山区发展茶果、蚕桑、养畜，在平原地区发展粮食、水禽和农副产品加工，逐步形成不同的区域性经济优势，取得显著的经济效益和社会效益。以水禽养殖业为例，现已发展到６２０万只，办起了８个羽绒加工厂和一批饲料厂、板鸭厂、松花蛋加工厂。这项产业的开发，使当地广阔水面和剩余劳力资源得到充分利用，使大批群众有了脱贫致富的门路。目前，信阳贫困地区已初步形成粮食、麻类、水禽、茶叶、林果、编织等几大支柱产业。
