The Liao-Shen Campaign Memorial Hall has been completed.

Jinzhou, this blood-soaked land, saw the erection of the Liao-Shen Campaign Memorial Monument soon after liberation. The memorial hall is located to the north of the monument, both aligned along the same central axis. The monument stands at the highest point, while the hall is situated at the base of the axis. Between them lies a tree-lined area, each occupying different terrain, one elevated and the other lowered, creating a harmonious contrast. Renowned architect Dai Nianci oversaw the design, with meticulous attention to layout, shape, and structure. The use of points, lines, surfaces, angles, and volumes is exceptionally refined, resulting in a style that is grand, solemn, and unadorned. It retains a distinct national character while embodying a strong sense of contemporary spirit.

Architecture is often praised for its "frozen music" beauty. If this architectural ensemble is seen as a symphony with three distinct movements, then the third movement—the memorial hall—is a powerful sonata. Exiting the memorial park and descending the stone steps, following the tree-lined path northward, is like the slow introduction of a musical piece. Entering the south gate of the memorial hall, the first thing that catches the eye is a Chinese-style archway, reminiscent of the triumphal arches used in the West to commemorate victories. The archway features seven large, gold-embossed characters written by Marshal Ye Jianying, reading "Liao-Shen Campaign Memorial Hall," serving as the title of the musical piece. Passing through the main gate, one enters the introductory hall, akin to the exposition section of the piece. Directly ahead is a granite-carved relief sculpture titled "River and Mountain," flanked by two decorative walls adorned with ten intricately carved medals. The ceiling is designed with 187 transparent skylights, fitted with blue filters, so that when the sun shines, the hall is bathed in a blue sky-like canopy.

Moving from the introductory hall to the right, one enters a uniquely structured exhibition hall. The corridors and exhibition rooms, like various musical techniques, form the development section of the piece.

The climax of the piece is the unique panoramic painting hall in the country. Ascending the spiral staircase and circling clockwise, one can appreciate the 120-meter-long, 15-meter-high panoramic oil painting of the Jinzhou Battle. It employs painting, sculpture, real objects, and landscape restoration to recreate the vast battlefield scene, bringing back the mountains, trees, ruins, and trenches of Jinzhou as they were during the war. The hall houses tens of thousands of artifacts. Here, one can find handwritten manuscripts by Zhu De, a telescope belonging to Luo Ronghuan, and a vest worn by Chen Yun; as well as relics of Liang Shiying, the red flag of the Jinzhou Spearhead Company that climbed the city walls, and water buckets used by support groups; and the names of nearly 300 martyrs including Zhu Rui, Mai Xin, Ma Yunfei, and Teng Dexin. The memorial hall is like a vast ocean, where heroes and passersby, meritorious deeds and crimes, greatness and ordinariness, are all justly represented in this "frozen symphony."

　　凝固的交响乐
    白雪生
    辽沈战役纪念馆落成了。
    锦州，这片血染的土地，解放初就矗立起了辽沈战役纪念碑。纪念馆坐落在纪念碑北侧，同处一条中轴线上。碑耸立制高点中心，馆卧于中轴线底部，中间隔着一条林荫地带，各抱地势，一俯一仰，呼应成趣。著名设计师戴念慈主持设计，布局、造型、结构颇具匠心，点、线、面、角、体极为讲究，风格雄浑、庄重、朴素，既保持了鲜明的民族特色，又具有强烈的时代精神。
    建筑艺术素有“凝固的音乐”之美称。如果说，这组建筑是由一园、一碑、一馆构成的交响曲三个段落分明的乐章，那末，第三乐章——纪念馆，就是气势磅礴的奏鸣曲。出陵园，下石阶，循林荫小路北行，犹如乐曲的慢速引子。进纪念馆南门，率先映入眼帘的是一座中国风格的牌楼，类似西方用以纪念胜利的凯旋门。眉额上嵌有叶剑英元帅题写的“辽沈战役纪念馆”七个鎏金大字，相当于乐曲标题。穿过正门，则是序厅，近乎曲中呈示部。迎面一幅花岗岩雕刻的浮雕《江山图》，两面各有一堵装饰墙，饰以十枚精雕细刻的勋章。墙顶呈雉堞状，象征人民军队似钢铁长城。天棚设有１８７个通透的采光斗，配以蓝色滤色片，旭日临照，大厅俨然笼罩在蔚蓝色的天幕之下。
    自序厅移步右行，至格局迥异的展厅。一道道回廊，一间间展厅，仿佛各种手法调转而成的乐曲展开部分。
    最后是乐曲的高潮——国内独有的全景画馆，沿螺旋式楼梯逶迤而上，顺时针方向绕行一周，就可以领略到周长１２０米、高１５米的巨幅油画——锦州攻坚战全景。它运用绘画、雕塑、实物、地貌复原等多种表现手段，再现了激战的宏观场面，使锦州的山川草木、断壁残垣、营垒战壕一如当年。馆藏文物数以万计。这里有朱德的手稿，罗荣桓的望远镜，陈云的背心；也有梁士英的遗物，锦州尖刀连登城红旗，支前群众的水桶；有朱瑞、麦新、马云飞、滕德新等近３００名烈士名录……纪念馆有如襟怀大度的海洋，英雄与过客、功勋与罪恶，伟大与平凡，在这“凝固的交响乐”中得到公正的表现。
