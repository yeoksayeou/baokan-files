	Greetings to Children on the Holiday
	New Type of Food Products Launched in the Capital's Market

	According to a report by Market News, a batch of new children's food products developed by the Beijing Children's Food Company, featuring multiple flavors, high nutrition, innovative designs, and premium packaging, will be launched in the capital's market before the June 1st Children's Day.

	Recently, they have developed more than ten kinds of food products, including fruit jam cookies and sesame paste cookies, which are both nutritious and cater to children's diverse taste preferences. Among them, the children's fruit juice series of nutrition rolls produced by Taoranting Food Factory have broken away from the traditional large and coarse image, offering different flavors such as hawthorn, Chinese bayberry, peach, and pear. With the assistance of the Pediatric Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, the Beijing Children's Food Factory has also developed "intelligence-enhancing cookies" that are beneficial for children's brain development. The plum juice beverage produced by Xinyuanzi Food Factory and the small-packaged plastic cup red fruit juice produced by Beijing Jinkao Factory will also make their debut to meet the broad masses of children. In addition, the supply of some famous and high-quality products has also increased.
