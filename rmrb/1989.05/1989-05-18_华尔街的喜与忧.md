Title: Joy and Worry on Wall Street

Recently, the U.S. dollar exchange rate and New York stock prices have been rising steadily, bringing new life to the narrow and gloomy Wall Street. On May 17th, the dollar's exchange rate against the Japanese yen and the West German mark reached 1:139.28 (Tokyo foreign exchange market) and 1:1.9710, respectively, up approximately 11% and 9.1% from the beginning of the year. On the same day, the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 2,462.43 points, up 723.69 points from the close on "Black Monday" in 1987. However, for the U.S. economy, this strong upward trend on Wall Street is not all good news; it is a mix of joy and worry.

The U.S. dollar exchange rate and New York stock market trends have traditionally been seen as a "barometer" of the U.S. economy. However, in recent years, this pattern has changed somewhat. While there is still a connection between them, it does not seem as close as it used to be, and sometimes they can even be out of sync. If we say that the recent stock buying frenzy on Wall Street has any connection to the economic situation, it is that the official economic indicators mostly show that the U.S. economic growth rate is slowing down, and the rate of inflation is not as severe as initially estimated. Investors, based on this, predict that the U.S. economy will continue to grow slowly and will not experience a recession in the near future, which is what they hope for, the so-called "soft landing." In the eyes of investors, economic "cooling" can reduce pressure on inflation, so the Federal Reserve will at least not tighten monetary policy in the near future, and may even lower interest rates. It is this general prediction by investors that has driven the stock market into a "bull market." Meanwhile, the high interest rates in the U.S. are the main factor supporting the high dollar exchange rate. Even if U.S. interest rates fall, they will still be much higher than those of other major Western countries. Coupled with the general prediction that there will be no economic recession in the near future, investors have rushed to buy dollars, driving up the dollar exchange rate.

A bullish stock market, to some extent, indicates that investors are confident in the near-term trend of the U.S. economy. This helps to avoid the adverse impact of stock market volatility on the economy. However, if stock prices rise too sharply, a "self-correction" like the "Black Monday" of October 1987 could occur, and the U.S. economy might not be able to withstand it. Therefore, the rise must be moderate.

The recent appreciation of the dollar has clearly exceeded the target range desired by the U.S. and other major Western countries. Although central banks in the West have taken intervention measures, the results have been limited. The high dollar exchange rate has its advantages and disadvantages. It helps to attract foreign investment, reduce import costs, and thus ease pressure on inflation. However, it also means that the prices of U.S. export products will rise accordingly, hindering their competitiveness in the international market, and thus frustrating the U.S.'s efforts to reduce its trade deficit through dollar devaluation.

As for the future direction of Wall Street, a relatively common view among economists here is that to stop the dollar's upward trend, major Western countries must take two major actions: first, to take bigger steps to directly intervene in the market; second, to coordinate on interest rates, i.e., the U.S. lowers interest rates, while Japan and Western Europe raise them. However, these economists also point out that fundamentally, the dollar exchange rate and stock prices are influenced by economic operations and human factors. At the slightest hint of trouble, they will fluctuate within a certain range.

　　华尔街的喜与忧
    本报记者  张亮
    近日来，美元汇价和纽约股票价格节节攀升，狭窄而阴暗的华尔街又现生机。１７日美元对日元、西德马克的汇价分别升至１∶１３９．２８（东京外汇市场）、１∶１．９７１０，比今年初上升大约１１％、９．１％。同日，道·琼斯３０种工业股票平均价格指数已升至２４６２．４３点，比１９８７年“黑色星期一”收盘时高７２３．６９点。然而，对美国经济来说，华尔街的这股强劲涨风并非全是好事，而是“亦喜亦忧”。
    美元汇价和纽约股市行情过去一向被视为美国经济的“晴雨表”。但近年来这一常规有所变化，它们之间虽有联系，但似乎不像以往那样紧密，甚至有时会出现脱节现象。如果说最近华尔街出现的股票争购风与经济现状有什么关联的话，那就是官方公布的多数经济指标表明美国经济的增长速度正在放慢，通货膨胀的上升幅度也不像人们原先估计的那样严重。投资者们据此估计，美国经济将继续慢速增长，不会在近期内发生衰退，也就是他们希望的所谓“软着陆”。在投资者看来，经济“降温”可以减轻对通货膨胀的压力，因而联邦储备委员会至少在近期内不会进一步紧缩银根，甚至有可能降低利率。正是投资者们的这种普遍预测，促使股票市场出现了“牛市”。而美国的高利率则是支撑美元高汇价的主要因素，即使美国的利率有所下降，仍大大高于其它西方主要国家，加之普遍预测近期不会发生经济衰退等因素，投资者们便纷纷争购美元，结果抬高了美元汇价。
    股市行情看好，在一定程度上表明投资者对近期美国经济发展趋势抱有信心。这有助于避免股市剧烈动荡对经济产生的不利影响。但另一方面，如果股票价格涨得太猛，某个时候再来个像１９８７年１０月发生的“黑色星期一”那样的“自我矫正”，美国经济恐怕是难以承受的，因此上升幅度只能适可而止。
    最近美元升值的幅度显然高于美国及其它西方主要国家所希望的目标范围。西方各中央银行虽采取了干预行动，但收效不大。美元高汇价有利有弊，它虽有助于吸引外国投资、减少进口费用进而减轻对通货膨胀的压力，但它也意味着美国出口产品价格的相应提高，有碍在国际市场上的竞争能力，从而使美国指望以美元贬值来削减其外贸赤字的努力遭受挫折。
    至于华尔街今后的动向，此间经济界较为普遍的一种看法是，如要阻止美元上升势头，西方主要国家必须采取两大行动，一是直接干预市场的步子要大；二是在利率问题上协调行动，即美国降低利率，日本和西欧提高利率。但是这些经济学家也指出，从根本上来说，美元汇价与股票价格受经济运转情况和人为因素所左右，一有风吹草动，它们就会在一定范围内起伏波动。
