To accept public supervision, ensure the cleanliness of cadres, and increase the transparency of bonus distribution, Anshan Steel recently decided to publicly disclose the monthly bonus distribution plan for leading cadres.

In enterprises, how much bonus the factory director receives and how much the leading cadres receive are often hot topics among the workers. Previously, due to the lack of a transparent distribution method, the distribution of cadres' bonuses had an air of mystery, which was not conducive to strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

For this reason, Anshan Steel Company stipulates that henceforth all bonuses paid in cash (excluding manuscript fees) must be recorded into the workers' wage credit cards. The bonus distribution plan, once approved, will be sent to the handling office along with the wage credit cards of the recipients. Those who violate the above regulations will not only have their bonuses approved for the unit stopped but will also be held accountable for the relevant personnel.

　　接受监督　保证廉洁
  　鞍钢公开干部奖金分配
    新华社沈阳５月１９日电（通讯员王大为、王忠奇）为了接受群众监督，保证干部廉洁，增加奖金分配透明度，最近鞍钢决定公开领导干部每月奖金分配方案。
    在企业中，厂长拿多少奖金，领导干部拿多少奖金，往往是职工们的热门话题。以往由于没有比较透明的分配形式，干部的奖金分配带上了一些神秘性，不利于密切干群关系。
    为此鞍钢公司规定今后所有由现金支付的奖金（稿酬除外），一律记入职工工资信用卡，奖金分配方案经批准后，连同受奖者的工资信用卡一并送交代办所。违反上述规定者除了停止对该单位审批奖金外，还要追究有关人员的责任。
