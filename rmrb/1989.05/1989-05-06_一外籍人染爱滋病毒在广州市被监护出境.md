A foreigner infected with the HIV virus was escorted out of Guangzhou today under the supervision of relevant authorities. This is the third case of an HIV patient in Guangzhou.

The 23-year-old male HIV carrier arrived in Guangzhou in January this year to study at a local overseas Chinese supplementary school. After blood tests and re-examinations by the Guangdong Institute of Epidemiology and the Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, he was confirmed to be infected with the HIV virus.

Currently, the Guangdong Provincial Health and Epidemic Prevention Department is conducting HIV antibody monitoring on the close sexual contacts identified by the patient.

Experts urge relevant personnel to maintain personal hygiene and self-respect when interacting with foreigners.
