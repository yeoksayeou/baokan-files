Title: Who is "Wasting Time" in Gymnastics Competitions?

A five-and-a-half-hour international gymnastics competition left the audience restless. They complained that the judges were scoring too slowly, and they were getting tired of waiting. Take the fourth Asian Youth Gymnastics Championships and the China Cup International Gymnastics Competition, for example; the main reason for the prolonged duration was the judges.

This year is the first year of implementing the new 1989-1992 International Gymnastics Federation scoring rules. Most judges have not yet obtained the new qualification certificates from the International Gymnastics Federation, and some are still unfamiliar with the new rules. Even if just one judge in a panel is not familiar with the new rules, it can slow down the entire competition. For instance, during the competition, invalid scores often appear, and the head judge has to convene the judges to discuss and adjust the scores. The domestic computer scoring system cannot handle score adjustments easily and requires re-entering all the data, which is slower than manual calculation.

During the judges' discussions, language barriers also arise. A panel might include judges who speak Japanese, Arabic, English, German, and Chinese, and the temporary translators might not understand gymnastics terminology. This creates quite a scene. The audience says, "All we see is the judges having a meeting!"

Additionally, the athletes' technical levels vary. Those with high skills start with a score of 10 and have few major errors, so scoring is quick. However, for athletes with lower skills, insufficient difficulty, and poor routines, the judges have to deduct points for various issues, making the scoring process slower. During the China Cup competition, Italian athlete Paolo Bartolini performed a flying maneuver on the horizontal bar, hit his face on the bar, fell off, and required medical attention. The competition was interrupted for about five minutes. The coach seemed unaware of the rules and wanted the athlete to continue, but the head judge of the horizontal bar did not decisively enforce the rules. It was only after the competition director intervened and firmly enforced the rule that a competition interrupted for more than 30 seconds cannot continue that the dispute was resolved. By then, the other events had already finished, and everyone was waiting for this one item, thus prolonging the time.

### 是谁在体操比赛中“磨洋工”？

　　是谁在体操比赛中“磨洋工”？
    一场国际体操比赛五个半钟头，观众坐不住了，他们说裁判员打分太慢，都等烦了。就拿第四届亚洲青年体操锦标赛和中国杯国际体操赛来说吧，拖长时间主要是裁判问题。
    今年是执行１９８９—１９９２国际体操新评分规则第一年，大部分裁判员尚未得到国际体联新的合格证书，有些人对新规则还不熟悉。一个裁判组哪怕有一个裁判员不熟悉新规则也要拖全场的后腿。譬如比赛中经常出现无效分，裁判长就要召集裁判员协商改分。国产电脑算分装置尚不能做到随便改分，必须全部重新输入，还不如手算快。
    裁判员协商时又碰到语言障碍，一个组可能有日语、阿拉伯语、英语、德语、汉语，临时找的翻译又不太懂体操。这下可热闹了。观众说，净看裁判员开会啦！
    其次，运动员技术水平高，都从１０分起评，没什么大失误，评分就快。运动员水平低，难度不够，编排不合要求，一套动作又停、又掉，这可考了裁判啦，东扣西扣，算分就慢了。中国杯赛上，意大利的鲍尔赛拉做单杠飞行，脸碰在杠上，掉下来又临时找医生，中断大约五分钟后，教练好像不懂规则，还要运动员继续做，单杠裁判长又未果断按规则执行。直到竞赛负责人出面，坚决执行中断超过３０秒不能再继续比赛的规则，才算解决这场争执。这时，其它项目早已结束，只等这一项，时间就这样被拖长了。
