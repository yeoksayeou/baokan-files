A movie theater located in the bustling area of Shanghai converted its 600-seat Peace Hall into a dance hall, reducing the number of seats by two-thirds, but increased its income by tenfold. Due to its unauthorized change in business direction, relevant departments stopped supplying it with films. This incident became a hot topic in Shanghai's media, with some newspapers even launching discussions on the matter.

In fact, movie theaters showing movies is a given, and there's no need for discussion. The reason it became a hot topic is related to the sharp decline in movie audiences and the losses incurred by movie theaters in recent years.

The number of movie viewers nationwide was less than 20 billion in 1988, with the total number of screenings that year being less than 30 million. This marked a simultaneous low point. Since October of last year, there has been a trend of nationwide audiences decreasing by 1 billion viewers per month. However, the number of movie theaters has not decreased, thus placing a heavy economic burden on them. In order to survive, they had to open up various business ventures.

Taking Shanghai as an example, out of more than 50 professional movie theaters in the city, 49 have engaged in sideline businesses. In 1987 and 1988, the income from these sideline businesses accounted for more than half of the total income, with bonuses reaching 50%. In contrast, the bonus rate for screenings was only 18%, and the actual bonus income for employees rose from around 300 yuan per year to around 1,000 yuan. Faced with these changes, everyone is pondering: What exactly is a movie theater for?

Looking at the global situation, the decline in audiences and the closure of movie theaters have become a trend. France produces 140 films annually, but the number of viewers dropped from 2 billion in 1982 to 1.2 billion last year, setting a post-war low. In the past three years, hundreds of movie theaters have been forced to close, and another 1/5 are on the brink of closure. It seems that the golden age of cinema is just a beautiful wish.

So, is the film industry becoming a "sunset industry"? Not necessarily. For example, in the United States, the number of viewers dropped to a historic low of 7.8 billion in 1977, but by 1987, it had risen to 12 billion. The key lies in the charm of the films themselves.

The film industry is a subordinate industry. When film production is not thriving, it also suffers. To make movie theaters focus solely on screenings and not engage in commercial activities or other ventures, there must be films that can attract audiences and maintain a certain level of attendance. Unfortunately, domestically produced films release around 150 films annually, but only about 1/4 of them have high box office returns. Under these circumstances, can movie theaters survive and develop by only showing films? For the sake of the future of movie theaters, it is not a bad temporary measure to use sideline businesses to support screenings. Our movie theaters should gradually be transformed into entertainment centers with fewer seats, better facilities, and multiple functions.

### 电影院是干什么的？

　　电影院是干什么的？
    李光一
    位于上海闹市区的一家电影院，把拥有６００余座位的和平厅改为舞厅，座位减少２／３，收入却增加了１０倍。因其擅自改变经营方向，有关部门停止向它供应影片。这件事成了上海传播媒介的一个“热门话题”，有些报纸还为此展开了讨论。
    其实，电影院放电影乃天经地义，无须讨论。它之所以成为“热门话题”，与近年来电影观众锐减，影院亏损有关。
    全国电影观众人数，１９８８年不到２００亿人次，全年放映场次不到３０００万场，同时进入低谷。而从去年１０月起出现了全国观众每月下降１亿人次的趋势。但电影院并没有因此减少，于是背上沉重的经济压力。为了生存，便不得不大开经营之门。
    以上海为例，全市５０余家专业影院，已有４９家搞副业，１９８７、１９８８两年副业收入占总收入的一半以上，奖金的提取可达５０％，而放映的奖金提取率只有１８％，职工的实际奖金收入已从每年３００元左右上升为千元左右。面对这种变化，大家都在思考：电影院到底是干什么的？
    从世界范围看，观众锐减，影院关闭，已成为一种趋势。法国每年摄制１４０部影片，观众人次却从１９８２年的２亿人次降到去年的１．２亿人次，创战后最低纪录。近３年，数百家影院被迫关闭，另１／５的影院濒临倒闭。要想再现电影的黄金时代，看来只是一种美好的愿望。
    那么，放映业是否已成为一种“夕阳行业”了呢？那也未必。比如美国，１９７７年的观众人次曾降到７．８亿的历史低点，而１９８７年又上升到１２亿人次，关键在于影片自身的魅力。
    放映业是一个从属性的行业，当电影创作不太景气时，它也不景气。要让影院只从事放映业，不从商或其它，必须要有能吸引观众、保持相当上座率的“硬档片”。令人遗憾的是，国产影片每年出品１５０部左右，但卖座率高的片子只有１／４左右。在这种情况下，影院只放电影，能够生存、发展吗？为了电影院前途着想，以副养映倒不失为权宜之计。我们的影院应当逐步改造为座位少、设施好、功能多的娱乐中心。
