Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 28th.

A patch of primeval forest within the Xishuangbanna Tropical Botanical Garden has become a "sanctuary" for rare and endangered tropical plants. Over the past year, 42 species of nationally protected plants have been relocated here for conservation.

This forest covers approximately 700 mu (about 46.7 hectares) and is situated on a peninsula surrounded by the Lancang River. To prevent intrusion by humans and animals, iron wire fences have been installed around the perimeter.

Xishangbanna is home to over a hundred wild relatives and closely related species of cultivated plants, earning it the reputation of a "gene bank" for plant genetic resources. It is a treasure trove for studying plant evolution and genetic engineering.

　　西双版纳救珍稀植物
    新华社昆明５月２８日电  （记者罗苹）中国科学院西双版纳热带植物园内的一片原始森林，已成为热带珍贵濒危植物的“避难所”。去年以来，４２种国家重点保护植物已被迁入这里保护。
    这片森林约７００亩，坐落在罗梭江环绕成的葫芦半岛上。为防人畜侵害，四周已安装铁丝网围栏。
    西双版纳拥有上百种栽培植物的野生类型及近缘种，被誉为植物种质资源库，是研究植物进化以及基因工程的宝地。
