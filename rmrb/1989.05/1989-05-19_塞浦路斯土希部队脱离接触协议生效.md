The disengagement agreement between the Greek Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish Cypriot forces in Cyprus, proposed by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, came into effect this morning.

A statement issued by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus said that both sides have withdrawn from 12 positions in three areas in the old town center of Nicosia. The statement expressed satisfaction with the actions taken by both sides.

The agreement was originally scheduled to take effect last month. However, due to disagreements over the personnel who would sign the agreement, its implementation was postponed until today.
