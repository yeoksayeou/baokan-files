Qijiang County in Sichuan Province has implemented a set of reforms in personnel management based on the principles of "public, equal, competitive, and selective." This has led to the formation of a preliminary scientific management mechanism.

Since 1988, Qijiang County has adopted a public selection process for some department-level leaders. The selection process is transparent, with clear procedures, evaluation criteria, and ranking. The principle of equal competition is upheld, breaking down barriers of industry, profession, and seniority to provide equal opportunities for all talents. For instance, the county's Economic Commission, during its organizational restructuring, publicly recruited four positions for the director and deputy directors.

The selection of township officials also follows the principle of transparency. In the Shihu District, the initial step was to publicly announce the number of positions, candidates, qualifications, and procedures. Out of 65 applicants, 12 were selected through interviews and professional knowledge tests. These candidates conducted field investigations, wrote policy plans, and gave public speeches and defenses. After rigorous screening, four individuals were selected. The selected candidates undergo a six-month probation period. If they perform well, they are recommended to the township people's congress for election as township administrative leaders. Currently, the county has selected 12 township-level leaders.

In recruiting contract-based township officials, Qijiang County has improved the previous emphasis on cultural examinations by focusing more on practical work abilities. First, based on the cultural examination results, preliminary candidates are selected and recommended by the county personnel bureau to various districts (townships) for practical work ability assessments. The candidates conduct village surveys and present their reports in a defense session attended by evaluation committees and community representatives, answering questions on the spot. Their organizational and coordination skills are also assessed. For example, the district committee assigns current key tasks or other work, and the candidates organize a community meeting to convey and implement these tasks. Those who pass the ability assessment are then ranked based on a composite score of cultural examination, ability assessment, and public trust. Last year, 60 individuals were selected through this method.

    綦江探索人事制度改革
    一批优秀者走上县乡领导岗位
    本报讯  四川省綦江县按照“公开、平等、竞争、择优”的原则，在干部的人事管理上进行配套改革，初步形成科学管理的良性循环机制。
    綦江县从１９８８年起对部分局级领导干部实行公开选拔。一是选拔程序公开、办法公开，考核公开，评审名次公开。二是坚持平等竞争，打破行业、职业和资历界限，为各类人才提供均等的选拔机会。县计经委在进行机构改革时，面向社会公开选拔主任、副主任４人。
    乡镇干部选拔也实行了公开的原则。在石壕区试点，一开始即把选聘名额、对象、条件、程序等向全县公开，接下来在６５名应聘者中通过面试初审、专业知识测试，确定１２人，让他们进行实地调查，撰写施政方案和公开演讲答辩，经过严格筛选，最后择优选聘了４位同志。被聘用者实行半年的试用期制，试用合格，拟作乡行政领导的，再提经乡人代会选举产生。目前，全县已选聘区乡级领导干部１２人。
    在招聘乡（镇）合同制干部中，綦江县改进前几年偏重文化考试的办法，加强实际工作能力的考核。首先，根据文化考试确定预选对象，再由县人事局把预选对象推荐给各区（镇），进行实际工作能力的考核。让预选对象下村调查，然后在考评小组和群众代表参加的答辩会上，宣读调查报告，并即席回答评委和群众代表就调查报告提出的问题。还要考察组织协调能力。比如，通过区委布置当前的中心工作或其它方面的工作，让应选者到村、社（在考评者的带领下）实地组织一次群众大会，传达贯彻落实。能力考核合格者，再以文化考试、能力考核和群众信任３项成绩的综合分，按高分到低分的原则，顺次录取。去年，通过这样的办法，共择优录用了６０人。
