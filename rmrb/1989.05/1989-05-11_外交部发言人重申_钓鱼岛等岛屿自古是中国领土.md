The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today reiterated that the Diaoyu Islands and other islands have been Chinese territory since ancient times. This is the consistent stance of the Chinese government. Of course, we are aware that the Japanese side also has its own claims. For this reason, China and Japan have agreed to set this issue aside for the time being and discuss it later.

The spokesperson made these remarks in response to a reporter's question. A reporter asked: According to reports in Japanese newspapers, Foreign Minister Uno has stated to Soviet leader Gorbachev that the Diaoyu Islands do not exist as a pending issue and have already been settled. What is the Chinese government's comment on this?

The spokesperson also said: "As far as I know, Foreign Minister Uno recently passed through Beijing and reported his visit to the Soviet Union to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, but he did not mention this matter at all."

　　外交部发言人重申    
    钓鱼岛等岛屿自古是中国领土
    新华社北京５月１１日电  外交部发言人今天重申，钓鱼岛等岛屿自古以来就是中国领土，这是中国政府的一贯立场。当然，我们知道日本方面也有自己的主张，正因为如此，中日双方同意把这个问题挂起来，以后再说。
    这位发言人是在回答记者提问时说这番话的。有记者问：据日本报纸报道，宇野外相曾向苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫表示，钓鱼岛不存在搁置的事实，已经进行了处理。对此，中国政府有何评论？
    发言人还说：“据我所知，宇野外相日前途经北京向钱其琛外长通报访苏情况时，只字未提此事。”
