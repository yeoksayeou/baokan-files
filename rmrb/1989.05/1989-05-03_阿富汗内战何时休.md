As some analysts had previously estimated, after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, the country fell into a civil war, and it is still uncertain when it will end.

No Hope for Reconciliation, Fighting Resumes. After the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan on February 15, people had hoped that after years of war, the various political factions in Afghanistan could establish a broadly based coalition government without external interference, to achieve domestic peace. However, the facts proved the prophets right once again.

On February 23, the Afghan resistance forces held a consultative conference and elected a provisional government led by the "Seven-Party Alliance." The members of the provisional government did not include the "Eight-Party Alliance" within the resistance forces, nor did they include the "upright Muslims" proposed by the "Seven-Party Alliance" within the current government, nor did they include Najibullah's People's Democratic Party. Therefore, the birth of this provisional government did not ease the internal contradictions within the resistance forces, nor could it resolve the sharp confrontation with the Kabul government. In early March, the provisional government held its first cabinet meeting in Afghanistan, proposing that "overthrowing the Najibullah regime by force is the primary task of the Mujahideen government." It chose the third-largest city in Afghanistan, Jalalabad, as the first target of attack, deploying about 40,000 troops for a strong assault. The government forces put up a fierce resistance. After more than two months of intense fighting, both sides suffered heavy casualties, and the outcome is still unclear.

Soviet and American Intervention, Escalating Civil War. The conflict within Afghanistan is a civil war caused by the deep-seated enmity and inability to reach a compromise between the opposing sides; while the two superpowers, the Soviet Union and the United States, continue to supply weapons to the factions they support, which is like adding fuel to the fire of this civil war. Before the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the Soviet Union provided a large number of advanced weapons and equipment, including MiG-27 fighter jets, Su-25 attack aircraft, SS-1 "Scud" tactical missiles, and BM-27 rockets, to strengthen the Afghan government's defensive and counterattack capabilities. After the withdrawal, the Soviet Union continued to provide military, economic, and diplomatic support to the Najibullah regime. The United States originally estimated that the Kabul regime would collapse immediately after the Soviet troops withdrew, but now realizes that this is "too naive and optimistic," and has decided to continue supporting the resistance forces until "the regime sponsored by Moscow is overthrown." It can be foreseen that as long as the opposing sides in Afghanistan continue to take a hardline stance, the two countries will not stop their interference activities. The Afghan civil war cannot be fought without a source of weapons, and even if it starts, it will be difficult to sustain for a long time. The attitudes of the United States and the Soviet Union obviously have a decisive influence on the Afghan civil war.

Balanced Forces, Indecisive Victory. Currently, the Najibullah regime is estimated to have 120,000 troops, while the resistance forces, under the leadership of the "Seven-Party Alliance," have about 150,000 guerrillas who can participate in long-term combat; under the "Eight-Party Alliance," there are also tens of thousands of fighters. Overall, both sides have roughly equal forces. In terms of weapons and equipment, the government forces are well-equipped and have air superiority, while the resistance forces are slightly inferior; in terms of morale, the resistance forces are determined to win and have high fighting spirit, while the government forces, especially the armed members of the People's Democratic Party, realize that only by fighting to the death can they avoid the fate of annihilation, and thus fight desperately. Furthermore, the resistance forces are skilled in guerrilla warfare, but are somewhat inadequate in fighting regular battles and assaults; while the government forces have received years of regular training, most of the officers have studied in the Soviet Union, and given that they are currently on the defensive in the present battle, holding out for a year and a half does not seem impossible.

Serious Situation, International Concern. The Afghan people, who have suffered from 10 years of war, universally detest war and yearn for a peaceful environment to rebuild their homes. The 5 million refugees who have fled to foreign countries are even more eager to return to their homeland with dignity. The deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan not only brings suffering to the Afghan people but also threatens the peace and stability of South Asia.

Currently, international public opinion is closely monitoring the developments in Afghanistan, hoping that the opposing sides in Afghanistan will prioritize national and ethnic interests, set aside past grievances, and work together to establish a broadly based coalition government with the participation of various political forces, turning weapons into plowshares and jointly working towards national reconstruction. At the same time, it is hoped that the Soviet Union and the United States will strictly adhere to the agreements signed at the Geneva Conference and refrain from interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs in any way or for any reason.

Additionally, people hope that the United Nations and relevant countries such as Palestine, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and others will continue to mediate between the various factions in Afghanistan, and mobilize the international community to restrain further Soviet and American interference in Afghanistan, forcing them not to do anything detrimental to Afghanistan's domestic peace and stability.

### 阿富汗内战何时休

　　阿富汗内战何时休
    李泽民
    正如一些分析家原先估计的那样，苏联军队从阿富汗全部撤走后，阿富汗陷入了一场内战，何时能够结束，尚难逆料。
    和解无望　战事再起。今年２月１５日苏军从阿富汗全部撤走后，人们曾经希望，在经历了多年的战争之后，阿富汗各派政治力量能够在没有外来干涉的情况下，早日建立一个具有广泛基础的联合政府，以实现国内的和平。但是，事实还是不幸给预言家们说中了。
    ２月２３日，阿抵抗力量协商会议选举成立了以“七党联盟”为主的临时政府。临时政府的成员既没有包括抵抗力量中的“八党联盟”，也没有“七党联盟”提出的现政权中的“正直的穆斯林”，更没有纳吉布拉的人民民主党。因此，这个临时政府的诞生既未能缓和抵抗力量的内部矛盾，更无法解决同喀布尔政府的尖锐对立。３月上旬，临时政府在阿境内举行了第１次内阁会议，提出“用武力推翻纳吉布拉政权是圣战者政府的首要任务”。它选择了阿第３大城市贾拉拉巴德作为第一个攻击目标，投入了４万左右的兵力进行强攻。政府军顽强抵抗。激战两个多月来，双方伤亡惨重，迄今还未见分晓。
    苏美插手　内战升级　阿富汗国内的冲突是敌对双方互不相容，积怨太深，未能达成妥协而导致的一场内战；而苏美两个超级大国出于自身的利益，继续向各自支持的一方输送武器，则无异是给这场内战火上加油。苏联在撤军前夕，向阿突击提供了一大批米格—２７战斗机、逆火式轰炸机、ＳＳ—１“飞毛腿”战术导弹和ＢＭ—２７火箭等先进的武器装备，以加强阿政府军的防守与反击能力。撤军之后，苏继续在军事上、经济上、外交上大力支持纳吉布拉政权。美国原来估计苏军撤走后，喀布尔政权将会顷刻垮台，现在认识到这是“过于盲目乐观”，从而决定继续支持抵抗力量，直到“莫斯科扶植的政权被推翻为止”。可以预见，只要阿对立双方继续采取强硬立场，苏美两家就不会停止其干涉活动。阿富汗的内战没有武器来源是打不起来的，打起来了也难以长期坚持，美苏两国的态度对阿内战显然有着举足轻重的影响。
    势均力敌　胜负难分　目前纳吉布拉政权估计有１２万人的兵力，抵抗力量方面，在“七党联盟”领导下能常年参加战斗的游击队约有１５万之多；在“八党联盟”麾下，还有数万战士。总的看来，双方兵力大体相当。在武器装备上，政府军装备精良，且占有空中优势，抵抗力量略逊一筹；从士气上看，抵抗力量志在必得，斗志旺盛，而政府军，尤其是武装起来的人民民主党党员，意识到只有拚死顶住，才能免遭覆灭的厄运，因而也就舍命抵抗。再则，抵抗力量擅长的是打游击战，打正规的阵地战、攻坚战就有点力不从心了；而政府军毕竟大多受过多年的正规训练，大部分军官都在苏联学习过，加之在目前的战斗中处于守方，坚持一年半载看来不是不可能的。
    局势严峻　各方关注　饱尝１０年战争苦难的阿富汗人民普遍地厌恶战争，在和平环境下重建家园是他们的迫切愿望，逃往异国他乡的５００万难民更是渴望能早日体面地重返家园。阿局势的恶化，不仅使阿富汗人民遭殃，它还危及南亚地区的和平与稳定。
    目前，国际舆论普遍关注阿富汗形势的发展，希望阿富汗敌对双方能以国家民族利益为重，捐弃前嫌，互谅互让，早日建立有广泛基础的、有各种政治力量参加的联合政府，化干戈为玉帛，共同致力于国家的重建工作。同时希望苏美两国必须严格遵守日内瓦会议签署的协定，不得以任何理由和方式干涉阿富汗的内部事务。
    另外，人们还希望联合国及有关国家如巴勒斯坦、伊朗、沙特阿拉伯等国能在阿各派力量之间继续进行斡旋，并广泛动员国际社会的力量，制约苏美对阿的进一步干涉，迫使他们不做对阿富汗国内和平和局势稳定不利的事情。
