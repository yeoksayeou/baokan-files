The steel industry is a major pillar of the U.S. economy. In the 1980s, the U.S. steel industry experienced its most severe downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s. From 1982 to 1986, over 400 steel plants closed, and more than 200,000 steel workers lost their jobs, accumulating losses of $12 billion. However, after several years of arduous efforts, the U.S. steel industry has finally emerged from the "crawling era" and is showing signs of growth once again.

According to a report by the U.S. magazine *Time*, the total profit of the U.S. steel industry last year is estimated to have reached $2 billion, and there is still hope to achieve this target this year. The largest steel company in the U.S., U.S. Steel Corporation, recently announced that last year the company made a profit of over $500 million from steel production, whereas in 1987, it only made $125 million. The U.S. steel industry's emergence from its difficulties and revival of vitality is hard-won:

Firstly, in order to revitalize, steel companies have invested heavily in updating equipment, improving efficiency, and reducing production costs. The main reason for the downturn in previous years was outdated equipment, backward technology, high production costs, and a lack of competitiveness in the international market. Since 1982, U.S. steel companies have invested $9 billion in factory renovations. At the same time, new materials such as plastics and ceramics have replaced many steel products, such as car bodies. Therefore, companies are striving to develop new products and fully utilize the advantages of steel. For example, U.S. Steel has developed lighter and more corrosion-resistant steel, further improving the continuous casting process, allowing molten steel to be directly produced into finished products.

Additionally, improving labor-management relations and working together to save the company. For instance, some factories have implemented worker ownership, allowing workers to become shareholders, encouraging them to sacrifice immediate interests, agree to wage and benefit cuts, and pool resources for production development. Some companies have negotiated with unions to implement measures that both sides can accept to save costs and achieve factory modernization.

The U.S. steel industry has also called on the government to restrict steel imports. Due to the higher cost and price of domestically produced steel, foreign steel products have increasingly captured the U.S. domestic market since the early 1980s, posing a direct threat to the U.S. steel industry. For this reason, in 1984, the Reagan administration reached a "voluntary restriction agreement" with 29 countries to limit steel imports. New U.S. President Bush also pledged during his election campaign to extend the aforementioned agreement, which expires next year.

Furthermore, the economies of Western developed countries, including the U.S., are showing signs of improvement. The continuous appreciation of the yen and the stable currencies of Western European countries, coupled with the weakening dollar, have also created favorable conditions and environments for the recovery and revitalization of the U.S. steel industry.

Currently, the upward trend in the U.S. steel industry remains strong. According to reports, the global economic situation looks promising this year, and the demand for steel in both the international and U.S. domestic markets will not decrease, indicating a good year for the U.S. steel industry. Additionally, due to the low exchange rate of the dollar and the tightening supply of steel in the international market, U.S. steel companies are paying more attention to the international market than before and are trying to increase steel exports. U.S. Steel announced that it will export over 10 million tons of steel this year. Therefore, some experts believe that although the U.S. steel industry will not return to the "boom era" of the 1960s or 1970s, its upward trend will not be a "flash in the pan."

　　美国钢铁业重现活力
    王如君
    钢铁工业是美国经济的一大支柱，进入８０年代，美国钢铁工业出现了自３０年代大萧条以来最为严重的不景气。１９８２年至１９８６年，共有４００多家钢铁工厂倒闭，２０多万钢铁工人失业，累计亏损１２０亿美元。但是，经过几年的艰难努力，美国钢铁工业终于走出了“爬行时代”，重新出现增长势头。
    据美国《时代》周刊报道，去年美国钢铁工业利润总收入估计达２０亿美元，今年仍有希望达到这个目标。美国最大的钢铁企业美国钢铁公司最近宣布，去年该公司生产钢铁赢利５亿多美元，而１９８７年却只有１．２５亿美元。美国钢铁工业走出困境、重现活力是来之不易的：
    首先，各家钢铁企业为了振兴，不惜花费巨资更新设备，提高效率，降低生产成本。前几年之所以不景气，主要是设备陈旧，技术落后，生产成本高，在国际市场上缺乏竞争力。自１９８２年以来，美国各钢铁企业在改造工厂方面的投资高达９０亿美元。同时，塑料、陶瓷等新材料，取代了许多钢材制品，如汽车车身。因此，各企业竭力研制新产品，充分发挥钢材的优势。如美国钢铁公司研制更轻和防腐性更高的钢材，进一步改进连续铸造程序，使钢水能直接生产出制成品。
    另外，改善劳资关系，双方合力拯救企业。如有的厂推行职工所有制，让职工入股，成为股东，劝说工人牺牲眼前利益，同意削减工资和福利，以便集资发展生产。有的企业同工会协商，制定出双方能接受的措施以节约开支，用以实现工厂现代化。
    美国钢铁工业界还呼吁政府，限制进口钢材。由于美国国产钢成本较高，价格较贵，８０年代初以来，外国钢产品占领的美国国内市场日益扩大，对美国钢铁工业形成直接威胁。为此，１９８４年，里根政府同２９个国家达成了“自愿限制协议”，限制钢的进口额。美国新总统布什在竞选中也曾允诺，将延长明年到期的上述协议。
    此外，西方发达国家以及美国自身经济呈现好转，加上日元不断升值、西欧国家币值坚挺，而美元疲软，这也为美国钢铁工业复苏和振兴创造了良好条件和环境。
    目前，美国钢铁工业上升势头仍然强劲。据报道，今年世界经济形势看好，国际市场和美国国内市场对钢的需求不会减少，美国钢铁工业将呈好年景。同时，由于美元汇价低，国际市场钢材供应趋紧，美国各钢铁公司对国际市场比以前更加重视，设法增加钢材出口量。美国钢铁公司宣布，它今年将出口钢材１００多万吨。因此，有专家认为，尽管美国钢铁工业不会回复到６０或７０年代的“繁荣时代”，但其回升势头也不会是“昙花一现”。
