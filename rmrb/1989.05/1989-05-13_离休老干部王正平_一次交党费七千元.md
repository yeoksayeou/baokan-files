Retired cadre Wang Zhengping from the New Xiang Military Sub-district in Henan Province recently donated 7,575.6 yuan, which he had saved over time, as party dues to the party organization, expressing his sincere devotion to the party.

Wang Zhengping joined the revolution in 1937 and formerly served as the deputy commander of the Yuxi Military Sub-district in Yunnan. He has always maintained a frugal and hardworking spirit, saving every extra penny and depositing it into the bank. To this day, his home does not have a single piece of high-end furniture. He is very thrifty with himself and his family.
