The tulips of the Netherlands, the windmills standing tall, and the quaint wooden clogs have long been famous. However, in this maritime country of Western Europe, there shines a star of Eastern civilization – the Sinology Institute of Leiden University.

Leiden University, with a history of over 400 years, is a renowned institution of higher learning in Europe and the Netherlands. It has produced great masters like the painter Rembrandt, Nobel laureates, and the physicist Van der Waals, among many other famous scholars and scientific elites. In the study of China, Leiden University is also a pioneer among many European institutions. As early as 1851, Leiden University established a Chinese language program. With the continuous development of Oriental studies, the Sinology Institute was founded in 1930. The famous Orientalist professor Doorenbosch (Chinese name Dai Wendata) served as the first director. The current director, Professor J.J.L. Duyvendak, is also a renowned scholar in Western Sinology. The Sinology Institute has now become one of the most important centers for Chinese studies in Western Europe. The current institute mainly consists of the Department of Chinese Language and Culture, the Chinese Library, and the Contemporary Chinese Literature and Documentation Center.

In recent years, Chinese has become a popular major at Leiden University, with the number of applicants each year exceeding the enrollment quota. The institute now has 400 students. According to the cultural exchange agreement between China and the Netherlands, the Sinology Institute sends more than ten students to various universities in China each year to study Chinese language and culture.

Students of the Sinology Institute are also very active in the university. This is largely due to the institute's student association. For this reason, I specially visited the chairman of the student association, Dirk van der Kooij.

Since he took over as chairman a year ago, the number of members in the student association has increased from the original 60 to over 130. When talking about the activities of the student association, he listed them one by one: "Last October, we organized a trip for students to Brussels, Belgium, to visit the 'Heaven and Earth' exhibition of 5,000 years of Chinese ancient inventions held by China. A month ago, we organized a trip to Paris to exchange and learn with the Sinology Institute there. We also often hold discussions on Chinese issues. Sometimes before the discussions, we even cook Chinese food together," he joked, "This way, both our spirits and bodies are enriched." Saying this, he casually picked up a copy of the student association's bimonthly magazine, *The Hanzi Report*. I flipped through it, and it contained the serialized translation of *The Old Monk's Collection of Trifles – Miscellaneous Warnings*, diaries of students studying in China, translations of famous Dutch essays into Chinese, and finally, the notice for the "Chinese Night" event in May.

When talking about the "Chinese Night," Dirk van der Kooij became particularly excited. This student association has fixed the previously held "Chinese Night" as an annual event. During the evening, students perform wonderful Chinese-language performances, and many overseas Chinese from various parts of the Netherlands come to join the fun, making it very lively. This time, they also plan to invite Prince Willem-Alexander, who is studying at the History Department of Leiden University, to participate.

　　一颗东方文明之星
    ——记荷兰莱顿大学汉学院及其学生会
    陈贽
    荷兰的郁金香、群立的风车，有趣的大木鞋，早已名闻遐迩。然而，在这个西欧临海之国中，还闪烁着一颗东方文明之星——荷兰莱顿大学汉学院。
    已有４００多年历史的莱顿大学是欧洲和荷兰的著名学府。这里曾产生过绘画大师伦勃朗、诺贝尔奖金获得者、物理学家范德瓦尔斯等一大批知名学者和科学精英。对于中国的研究，莱顿大学也堪称是欧洲众多学府中的先锋。早在１８５１年，莱顿大学便开设了中文专业。后随着东方学研究的不断发展，１９３０年，成立了汉学院。著名的东方学教授道闻达克（中文名戴文达）担任首任院长。现任院长许理和教授也是当代西方汉学研究的著名学者。汉学院如今已成为西欧中国研究最重要的中心之一。现在的汉学院主要由中国语言文化系，中文图书馆和当代中文文献资料中心组成。
    近年来，中文已成了莱顿大学的热门专业，每年报考的学生都超过招生名额。全院现已有４００名学生。根据中荷两国文化交流协定，汉学院每年都要派十多名学生前往中国各大学学习中国语言文化。
    汉学院的学生在大学里也显得异常活跃。这很大程度上归功于汉学院的学生会。为此，我专门走访了学生会主席德克阳。
    自从他一年前担任学生会主席以来，学生会成员由原来的６０多人增加到１３０多人。谈起学生会的活动，他如数家珍：“去年１０月我们组织同学去比利时的布鲁塞尔参观了那里由中国举办的‘天地之间’——五千年中国古代发明大型展览会。一个月前我们又组织去了巴黎，到那里的汉学院进行交流学习。我们还常常举办有关中国问题的讨论会。讨论前大家有时还一起做顿中国饭哩，”他开玩笑说，“这样精神和物质都得到了充实。”说着，他又随手拿起一份刚印出的学生会双月刊《汉字报》。我信手翻来，里面有《老僧拾陋辑——警世杂篇》的英文翻译连载，有正在中国学习的汉学院学生的日记选登，有荷兰著名散文的中文翻译。最后是５月份举办“中国之夜”的通知。
    谈到“中国之夜”，德克阳显得格外兴奋。这届学生会把以前举办过的“中国之夜”固定为每年一次。晚会上由学生表演精采的中文节目，荷兰各地的许多华侨也赶来助兴，热闹非常。这次他们还准备邀请在莱顿大学历史系就读的荷兰王子威廉·亚历山大参加。
