The second match of the fifth China-Japan Go Championship was held today at the Japanese Go Association. Yang Shihai, a 3rd dan player, lost to Yonda Yuichi, a 9th dan player, in the middle of the game.

Yonda Yuichi is the only player from the Kansai Go Association participating in the competition and is known as the "Kansai Universe Flow." Yonda, playing black, took the initiative to deploy a double star formation, aiming to showcase his strengths. Yang Shihai responded with a star and a point outside. Starting from the 5th move, both players engaged in a fierce battle in the lower-left corner. By the 50th move, black had secured the lower-left corner, while white took the opportunity to develop external influence, making the situation favorable. In the middle of the game, Yang Shihai made a mistake on the right side, allowing black to gain the upper hand. Subsequently, white struggled to break free from the disadvantage, but black responded accurately, maintaining the advantage. By the 139th move, white conceded defeat in the middle of the game. The match lasted less than 5 hours.

After two matches, both the Chinese and Japanese teams have won one game each. The third and fourth matches will be held on June 17th and 19th in Hangzhou, China. Zhang Wende, a 20-year-old Chinese player, will face Yonda Yuichi.

    杨士海中盘负于苑田勇一
    本报东京５月１８日电  记者于青报道：今天在日本棋院进行的第五届中日围棋擂台赛第二场比赛中，杨士海三段中盘负于苑田勇一九段。
    苑田勇一是日方参赛的唯一来自关西棋院的棋手，有“关西宇宙流”之称。苑田执黑先行，意在发挥擅长的棋风，布下二连星。杨士海应以星·目外。从第５手开始，双方就在左下角展开了短兵相接的角逐。直至５０余手，黑棋占据左下角，白棋乘机发展外势，棋形看好。棋入中盘后，杨士海右侧着法有误，被黑棋占得便宜。赢得主动。此后，白棋为摆脱劣势，多方努力，但黑棋应对无误，始终未能改变形势。下至１３９手，白棋投子中盘认负。对局用时不到５个小时。
    经过两场比赛，中日双方各胜一盘。第三、四场比赛定于６月１７日、１９日在中国杭州举行。届时由中国２０岁的年轻棋手张文东出战苑田勇一。
