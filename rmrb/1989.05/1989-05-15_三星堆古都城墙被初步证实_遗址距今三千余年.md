The ancient city wall of Sanxingdui has been initially confirmed. The site is over three thousand years old.

According to the latest news from the excavation site of the Sanxingdui site in Sichuan, some experts' conjecture four years ago that the "earth ridges" around the Sanxingdui site might be the city walls of the ancient Shu capital has been initially confirmed.

According to Chen De'an, the director of the Sanxingdui Site Workstation of the Sichuan Provincial Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology, since the excavation of the earth ridges began last October and is still ongoing, the main wall, the protective slope, and the moat of the city wall have been identified. The base of the city wall is 40 to 50 meters wide, with a trapezoidal cross-section, composed of artificially rammed solid soil. The boundary between the main wall and the protective slope is clear, and traces of rows of earth bricks are found on the upper part. The protective slope unearthed inverted V-shaped rammed layers, and the rammed surfaces have clear and dense impressions of striped objects.

The existing city wall of the Sanxingdui site is discontinuous, with a total length of over 2,600 meters, averaging 3 to 5 meters above the ground, and reaching 6 meters at the highest point. It is mainly distributed in the eastern, western, and southern parts of the central area of the site, with the Yazi River serving as a natural barrier on the northern side, thus forming a complete defensive structure.

Some indications suggest that the moat of the ancient city wall may also have been an ancient canal connecting the two tributaries of the Tuojiang River upstream—Yazi River and Mazhu River—serving both flood control and transportation purposes. Chen De'an believes that this method of fully utilizing geographical conditions, alternating earth walls and waterways, and meeting multiple needs such as defense, drainage, and transportation to build a city barrier, demonstrates the outstanding wisdom of the ancient Shu people.

According to preliminary research, the city wall was built during the early Shang Dynasty or even earlier. The area of the city is approximately 3 to 4 square kilometers, comparable to the famous Erligang Shang City in Zhengzhou.

　　三星堆古都城墙被初步证实    
    遗址距今三千余年
    新华社成都电（记者冯先受、陈燮）据来自四川三星堆遗址发掘现场的最新消息表明，一些专家四年前提出的三星堆遗址周围的“土埂”可能是古蜀都城城墙的推测，已经得到初步证实。
    据四川省文物考古研究所三星堆遗址工作站站长陈德安透露，在从去年１０月开始，迄今仍在进行的土埂发掘中，已探明城墙的主墙、护城坡和护城河壕沟。城墙基础宽４０至５０米，横剖面呈梯形，由人工夯击坚实的泥土组成。主城墙与护城坡分界明显，上部发现左右成排的土坯痕迹。护城坡出土倒人字形斜夯层，夯面上条状物拍打印迹清晰可见，而且相当密集。
    三星堆遗址现存的城墙呈不连续状，总长２６００余米，平均高出地面三至五米，最高处达六米。主要分布在遗址中心区的东边、西边和南边的马牧河湾道间，北边则以鸭子河为自然屏障，从而构成一个完整的防御工程。
    一些迹象表明，古城墙的护城河壕沟，还可能是连接沱江上游两条支流—鸭子河和马牧河之间的古运河，兼具防洪和交通运输作用。陈德安认为，这种充分利用地理条件，以土墙与水道相间，兼顾防御、排涝、运输多方面需要，构筑都城屏障的方法，显示了古蜀人杰出的智慧。
    据初步考证，城墙的修筑年代相当于商代早期或更早一点时间。城区面积约三至四平方公里，与著名的郑州二里岗商城相当。
