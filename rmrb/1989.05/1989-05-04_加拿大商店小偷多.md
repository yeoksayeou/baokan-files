Canada has a significant problem with shoplifting, according to a survey released today by the Canadian Retailers Council. The survey reveals that every day, goods worth 2 million Canadian dollars are stolen from stores by both customers and employees. This is an embarrassing issue for a country known for its social stability and high level of civilization.

The survey indicates that the value of stolen goods as a percentage of total retail sales has decreased from 1.36% in 1985 to 1.28% in 1988. However, due to the overall increase in retail sales, the actual amount stolen has risen from 1 million Canadian dollars per day in 1985 to 2 million Canadian dollars per day in 1988.

　　加拿大商店小偷多
    本报渥太华５月３日电  记者郭文福报道：根据加拿大零售商理事会今天发表的一项调查，加拿大每天有价值２００万加元的商品被顾客中的扒手和商店职工中的小偷窃走。这对社会秩序安定、人们文明程度较高的加拿大不能不说是一件很难堪的事情。
    根据这项调查，商店东西被窃的数额自１９８５年占总零售额的１．３６％下降至１９８８年的１．２８％。尽管如此，由于总零售额的增长，被窃的数额仍由１９８５年的每天１００万加元，增至１９８８年的２００万加元。
