A Lone Swan Circling
— Impressions of Poet Zhang Hongxi

Zhang Hongxi is a romantic, and thus he wrote “Shoes are torn, hat is torn,” and thus because of “Shoes are torn, hat is torn,” he won half of the 10-year Golden Melody Award for lyricists in mainland China.

Chinese characters are a kind of feeling. “Hongxi,” a lone swan circling over the borderlands, his name makes one feel sad, and it is a pity that his life is also like this. Li Bai said, “People say autumn emotions are sad, I say autumn emotions are joyful.” Li Bai is an immortal, his talent is too high, ordinary people cannot reach it. Du Fu said, “The falling leaves deeply know the sorrow of Song Yu.” It seems that Hongxi is a disciple of Old Du, feeling the times and events. Because of his melancholy, he created more than a hundred famous film and television song lyrics. He wrote the theme song for the movie “Sunrise”: “Life is like a dream, you and I meet in a dream. When the dream ends and the heart breaks, the face of a person and the blossoming peach are gone without a trace.” This brought to life Chen Bailu’s soul. Cao Yu listened and could not help but clap his hands and sigh, repeatedly saying he did not expect that in the south, a thousand miles away, there would be such a contemporary soulmate. In the competition with first-class poets and lyricists across the country, with lyrics like “Where to find spring, where to find autumn, seek spring flowers and autumn moon in dreams,” “Everywhere is frost, everywhere is snow, snow and frost oppress the plum and it withers,” “With a roar to the sky I protest, blood and tears in the family’s spring and autumn,” he shook Ba Jin’s heart, and thus became the theme song lyricist for the TV series “Family, Spring, Autumn.”

At over forty years old, Zhang Hongxi himself belongs to a melancholy generation. When writing the theme song for the TV series “Yan Fengying,” when he wrote “The yellow plum blossoms are sweet and the hometown’s accent is sweet, in heaven and on earth you are still singing with deep emotion,” he could not help but shed tears, and large teardrops wet the poem paper.

Zhang Hongxi initially gained fame through poetry, but his name became known to ordinary people only after he wrote the theme song for the TV series “Ji Gong” “Shoes are torn, hat is torn” more than twenty years after he became a poet. Zhang Hongxi’s life has been full of hardships. He comes and goes alone, with a frail body, known for his “bitter recitation” on the song stage, writing poems and songs to make a living and support his elderly mother. Zhang Hongxi grew up in the alleys of Shanghai, wandering among the common people. He felt that Ji Gong, who was also a common person, embodied a spirit of upholding justice and promoting good while suppressing evil. One rainy night, Zhang Hongxi saw an old woman standing by the river, about to jump in. He shouted from afar and rushed over to save her, then sent her home, but he himself was soaked by the heavy rain and fell ill for many days. He considered this a matter of course.

The melancholy Zhang Hongxi became Zhang Hongxi not only because of his innate melancholy character but also because of his innate sincere poetic heart. His poems and lyrics are like flowing water, clear and simple, yet also implied and beautiful. I remember that year, when invited to Nanjing to observe the filming of the TV series “Yan Fengying,” when reading the theme song “The Wind of the Countryside,” and hearing that the lyrics were written by a poet from Shanghai, several colleagues unanimously guessed that the poet was Zhang Hongxi.

　　孤鸿盘桓
    ——诗人张鸿西印象
    陈鹏举
    张鸿西是个情种，于是写出了“鞋儿破、帽儿破”，又于是因了“鞋儿破、帽儿破”，摘取了１０年金曲中国大陆１／２４的词作者的桂冠。
    中国的文字是一种感觉。“鸿西”，孤鸿盘桓于塞上，其名教人凄然，可叹他的人亦如此。李白说，“人言秋兴悲，我言秋兴逸”。李白是谪仙，天份太高，凡人难以攀援。杜甫说，“摇落深知宋玉悲”。看来鸿西是老杜的弟子，忧时感事。因其凄郁，创作出了上百部脍炙人口的影视歌词。他为电影《日出》写出了这样的主题歌：“人生好似一场梦，你我相逢在梦中。待到梦残心碎时，人面桃花去无踪”。活化出陈白露的心灵。曹禺听后，不禁抚掌而叹，连说想不到南国千里，会有这么个异代知音。鸿西在与全国一流诗人词家的角逐中，以“何处觅春，何处觅秋，春花秋月梦中求”，“到处是霜，到处是雪，雪压霜欺梅也瘦。”“冲天一声我控诉，血泪家春秋”这样的词章，震撼了巴老的心，从而一举成为电视剧《家·春·秋》的主题歌词。年逾四十的张鸿西，他本身便属于凄郁的一代，他在为电视剧《严凤英》撰写主题歌词，当写到“黄梅好听乡音甜，天上人间你还在深情地唱”时，不由潸然泪下，大颗泪珠溅湿了诗笺。
    张鸿西初已诗成名，可他的名字，飞入寻常百姓家，应该说是在他作为诗人２０余年之后，是在他写出了电视剧《济公》的主题歌“鞋儿破、帽儿破”之后。张鸿西生活坎坷，他来去萧条一病躯，以“苦吟”闻名于歌台舞榭，以写诗，写歌维持生计，侍奉老母。张鸿西生长于上海的市井陋巷之间，浪迹于引车卖浆之流，他对济公的情感，仿佛是一个忘年的朋友。他以为与他同为平民的济公，所体现出的是匡扶正义，扬善抑恶的襟怀。一天雨夜，张鸿西在滂沱大雨中，看见一位老妪在江边呆立，旋而欲跃入江中，他远远地振臂狂呼，扑上前去，救下了老妪，并送她回到家中，他自己却被大雨淋个浑身透湿，且卧病多日。他于此以为天经地义。
    凄郁的张鸿西，之所以成为张鸿西，除了他天赋的凄郁性格，还有他天赋的虔诚诗心。他的诗词有如水流畅的文字，其明白如话，而又含蓄凄丽。记得那年应邀去南京观摩电视剧《严凤英》的拍摄，当读到主题歌《山野的风》，又听说歌词出自上海诗人之手时，几位同仁异口同声猜出那诗人就是张鸿西。
