	Wind, rain, and hail have repeatedly struck Guizhou. The provincial Party committee and government have been carefully arranging the lives of the disaster-affected people while leading the masses to stand up and fight against the disaster, engaging in self-rescue production.

	This spring and summer, 61 out of the province's 87 counties (cities, districts) have been hit by strong winds, heavy rain, and hail, affecting 1,809,000 mu (approximately 120,600 hectares) of farmland. Spring crops have been completely destroyed on 459,000 mu (approximately 30,600 hectares).

	After the disaster, despite financial difficulties, the province allocated 52.6 million yuan in relief funds. This money has been used to purchase 77.33 million kilograms of relief grain, which has been distributed to severely affected households. Additionally, 40 million yuan has been added to agricultural production investments, and 2,500 tons of fertilizer for disaster relief have been allocated.

	The entire province is making great efforts to fight against the disaster. Agricultural production has shown good momentum. The area planted with autumn grain crops has increased by more than 320,000 mu (approximately 21,300 hectares) compared to last year. Additionally, 630,000 mu (approximately 42,000 hectares) of various spring potatoes and more than 1 million mu (approximately 66,600 hectares) of vegetables and fruits have been planted.
