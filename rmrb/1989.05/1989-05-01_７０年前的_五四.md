70 years have passed, but the scenes of the May Fourth Movement are still vivid in my mind.

On May Fourth, I was still with my second brother, Bing Jie, who had just undergone an ear surgery, at the German Hospital. The next day, my classmate from the Co-And Women's University, Che Mei Di, rushed over. She said, "Xiao Xie, you should go back quickly! Yesterday, students in Beijing, to stop the Beiyang warlord government from signing the treaty to sell Qingdao, gathered for a parade, distributed leaflets, and shouted slogans. Finally, they rushed to the traitor Zhang Zongxiang's residence, burned down the Zhao family's building, and many students were arrested! In a few days, they will be questioned, and you, as the 'Student Union' secretary, are supposed to go to listen and write a report. Hurry back!"

She spoke with great excitement and enthusiasm. The next day, I took my brother, who was still recovering from surgery, back home and returned to school.

Co-And Women's University was a missionary school. Its education for students was to "listen to the gospel with all your heart" and "study diligently with all your heart," never paying attention to politics. However, the unprecedented and powerful patriotic movement finally broke through this barrier. We also stopped classes, participated in parades, and propaganda. We also went in groups of three or five, holding "exemption boxes," in the cold wind in front of the old Tiananmen Gate, stopping passersby, asking them to donate a few copper coins to help us comfort the arrested students. We went in large groups to listen to the trial of the arrested students in the Beijing court. I also wrote an article titled "Trial Record" and sent it to the *Morning Post* for publication. From then on, I began to write articles in vernacular Chinese against feudalism and imperialism, and also started writing novels, all describing social problems at that time.

Because of writing, I missed many practical courses in the sciences, such as anatomy. I originally wanted to study medicine and entered the pre-medical science department of Co-And Women's University. Now I can only give up science and turn to literature. Was this a "wrong path"? I am still not sure to this day!

　　７０年前的“五四”
    冰心
    ７０年过去了，“五四”运动的画面在我的心版上却十分真切。
    “五四”那天，我还陪着刚动过耳后手术的二弟为杰，住在德国医院。第二天我的协和女子大学的同学车美地就匆匆忙忙地跑来了，说，“小谢，你快回去吧！昨天北京的学生为了阻止北洋军阀政府签订出卖青岛的条约，聚众游行，在街上散发传单，高呼口号，最后涌到卖国贼章宗祥的住处，火烧了赵家楼，有许多学生被捕了！过几天就要审问，你这个‘学生会’的文书，是要去旁听写报告的，快回去吧！”她说得又兴奋又激昂，第二天就带着病后的二弟回家，又回到学校去了。
    协和女大是个教会学校，对于学生的教育是：“专心听道”、“安心读书”，从来不关心政治的。但是这次空前的声势浩大的爱国运动的力量，终于把这道防堤冲破了，我们也罢了课，参加游行，参加宣传，还三三两两地抱着“扑满”，在大风中黯旧的天安门前拦住过往的行人，请求大家捐几个铜子儿，帮助我们慰问那些被捕的学生。我们大队大队地去参加旁听北京法庭对于被捕学生的审问，我还写了一篇《听审记》送到《晨报》发表，从此我便开始用白话文写反封建、反帝国主义的文章，又写开了小说，都是描写当时社会问题的。
    因为写作，我耽误了许多理科的实习功课，如解剖学之类。我本来想学医，入的是协和女大的理预科，现在只好弃理从文，这是否“误入歧途”呢？我至今也弄不清楚！
