	Indiscriminate Slaughter of Draft Cattle Affects Production

	In March, I visited Jiangzhou Township in Jiujiang County and saw some farmers preparing the land for cultivation. I asked an elderly farmer why he wasn't using oxen to plow. The farmer sighed and said, "The oxen, all sold!" Some farmers mistook me for a cattle dealer and told me, "If you want to buy oxen, go to the market." One farmer informed me, "Most of the draft cattle in this township have been slaughtered by cattle dealers and sold to Nanjing." Another farmer said, "In the past, cotton fields needed to be plowed two or three times a year. Now, some families' land hasn't been plowed for years."

	Why did they sell the draft cattle? The village cadres told me: First, after the contract responsibility system, the land was divided into plots, making it difficult for oxen to be useful; second, after the draft cattle were allocated to households, several families shared one ox, often causing disputes over its use and feeding. Families with little land and many laborers found it unprofitable to raise oxen, and hiring someone to take care of the oxen cost five or six hundred yuan a year; third, opening up land for cultivation encroached on the grazing areas for draft cattle; fourth, some households, when they needed an ox, would borrow one from relatives or friends, so they simply sold their own; fifth, originally, to sell or slaughter draft cattle, one needed permission from the township, village, and veterinary stations, but now no one enforces this.

	Currently, in a situation where agricultural mechanization is not yet advanced, draft cattle remain an indispensable resource for agricultural production. What measures will the relevant departments take to stop the indiscriminate slaughter of draft cattle?

　　滥杀耕牛影响生产
    ３月间，我在九江县江洲乡看见一些农民挖地备耕。我问一位正在挖地的老农为何不用牛耕？老农叹了口气说：“牛，全卖了！”有的农民以为我是牛贩子，便对我说：“要买牛，到菜市场去。”一位农民告诉我：“这个乡的大部分耕牛被牛贩子宰了卖到南京。”另一位农民说：“以往，棉地每年要翻耕两三遍，现在有的人家的地，几年都不翻耕了。”
    为什么要把耕牛卖掉呢？村干部告诉我：一是承包以后，土地已条块分割，耕牛难有用武之地；二是耕牛分到户后，几家人共用一头牛，经常为牛的使用和喂养闹矛盾，土地少劳力多的，认为养牛不合算，请人放牛，一年要花五六百元；三是开荒扩种蚕食了耕牛放养场地；四是有的农户到了用牛时，便“劳驾”亲友的牛，于是干脆把牛卖掉；五是原来耕牛要卖要杀，需得到乡、村、兽医站等部门的许可，现在没人管了。
    目前，在农业机械化还不发达的情况下，耕牛仍是不可缺少的农业生产资料。有关部门采取什么办法制止滥杀耕牛呢？
