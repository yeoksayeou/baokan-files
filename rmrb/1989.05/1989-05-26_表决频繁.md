Title: Frequent Voting

During the two-hour opening ceremony, whether it was the presidium, the voting committee, the credentials committee members, the agenda, the conference rules, or whether major motions should be voted on by name, or whether Gorbachev's chairing of the conference was in accordance with the regulations... almost everything was put to a vote by a show of hands, totaling 10 times. Initially, Gorbachev counted the number of hands raised, but later it was changed to the voting committee counting by sections. Some procedures had 379 votes against, while others had only 431 votes in favor, taking 5 minutes to count.

In the past, the Soviet Union rarely had anyone vote against motions during conferences. It was a grand sight, but the 6,000-seat Grand Kremlin Palace lacked even basic voting equipment, let alone computers.

    表决频繁
    在两小时的开幕式上，不论是主席团、计票组、资格审查委员会成员，还是议程、大会规程，或是重大议案是否应记名表决、戈尔巴乔夫主持大会是否符合规定……几乎事事举手表决，先后共１０次。起先由戈尔巴乔夫清点举手人数，后改为由计票组分片点数。有的程序反对票达３７９人，有的只４３１人赞成，用了５分钟才数清。
    苏联过去开大会极少有人在表决时投反对票。蔚为壮观，座席６０００的克里姆林宫大会堂缺乏起码的计票设备，更不必说计算机了。
