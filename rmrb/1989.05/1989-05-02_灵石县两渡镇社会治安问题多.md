There are numerous social security issues in Liangdu Town, Lingshi County, Shanxi Province. A group of lawless individuals frequently block roads and commit robberies, causing significant harm to local residents. Once, a worker from the Tieshin Coal Mine, carrying 400 yuan, was robbed of all his money while shopping. On the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, four workers from the Tieshin Coal Mine were robbed of a quilt when they went to Liangdu Town to buy cotton batting.

This group of individuals often enters passenger trains and public places, openly picking pockets, assaulting people, and stealing items, severely disrupting social order.

　　灵石县两渡镇社会治安问题多
    我省灵石县两渡镇有一伙不法分子拦路抢劫，当地居民深受其害。一次，铁新煤矿一工人身带四百元钱上街买东西，被这伙人洗劫一空。农历正月初七，铁新煤矿四个职工去两渡镇买棉絮，又被这伙人抢走一床。
    这伙人还经常出入旅客列车及公共场所，明目张胆掏腰包、打人、抢东西，严重地扰乱了社会治安。
