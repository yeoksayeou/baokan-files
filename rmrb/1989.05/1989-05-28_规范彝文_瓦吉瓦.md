About forty men sat in the classroom of the Zhukernu Agricultural Technical School for Farmers, facing a blackboard filled with Yi script. They listened and took notes, very seriously. The teacher, Makala, told me that these students were mostly newly literate farmers. This was what I saw and heard on my first day in Zhaojue County, Sichuan Province, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture.

Shaguluo from Ergu Township is a female student at this agricultural technical school. She is 40 years old and two years ago, after becoming literate, she led and guided 61 women to become literate. Shaguluo said that the success of literacy efforts was all thanks to the promotion and use of the "Yi Script Standardization Scheme." I asked her, "Is the Yi script standardization good?" She replied, "Wajiwa! Wajiwa!" meaning: "Very good."

The Yi script has been in use since at least the Eastern Han Dynasty, but the "Yi Script Standardization Scheme" was only promulgated by the State Council in 1980. Over the intervening two thousand years, the development of the Yi script has experienced many twists and turns. First, the mountains blocked communication, and slave owners ruled, causing the Yi dialects in the Liangshan region to be diverse and chaotic. Different regions and different clans had different language norms, severely hindering communication among Yi people, and also causing the Yi script to deviate from its development path. After liberation, the Yi script's journey was also difficult. First, Yi script education was abolished in primary and secondary schools, and Mandarin was fully promoted; later, a new scheme was promoted to replace the Yi script with a phonetic script, causing the Yi script to nearly disappear. Only with the "Yi Script Standardization Scheme" did the Yi script achieve true unification and enter a period of prosperity and development.

The standardization of the Yi script began with only 5.3% of the total Yi population in Liangshan able to read Yi script. Promoting the use of the new Yi script scheme among 94.7% of illiterates was fraught with difficulties. The decision-makers in the prefecture did not retreat in the face of difficulties. They recognized that to develop the national economy, they must improve the overall cultural level of the nation. To tackle illiteracy, the prefecture established a Commission for Workers and Peasants Education, with Yi Autonomous Prefecture Party Secretary Luo Kaiwen as the director, and set up an office in the prefecture's Education Bureau. The work steps were also clear: the first step was to eliminate illiteracy, with night schools as the main body; the second step was to consolidate and improve, with agricultural technical schools as the main body.

The most difficult part of eliminating illiteracy was the lack of funds and teachers. When the illiteracy elimination work was fully launched in 1980, there was no money, so they used warehouse courtyards as classrooms, and paper boards, wooden cabinets, and mud walls as blackboards, using pine torches as lights for classes; there were no teachers, so they selected more than 7,000 young people, first teaching them the Yi script, making them teachers and cadres for Yi script illiteracy elimination work. At the same time, the prefecture's Education Bureau organized forces to compile the "Yi Script Standardization Character Table," "Yi Script New Character Table," "Yi Script Primer," "Picture Recognition," and other charts and textbooks.

Night schools became the favorite place for farmers who had worked all day. By the end of 1987, among the 1.4 million Yi people in Liangshan Prefecture, 440,000 could read Yi script, accounting for 31.4%. Last year, out of the 10 Yi-populated counties in the prefecture, 7 had become nationally recognized illiteracy-free counties.

Previously, farmers in Liangshan did not believe in chemical fertilizers; they mixed phosphate fertilizer with mud to plaster walls; the plastic film distributed to them was all used to cover chicken coops and dog houses. After the first batch of illiterate people entered the agricultural technical school, they took the lead in using advanced production technologies such as plastic film coverage, increasing corn yields from the original 90-plus kilograms per mu to 300-plus kilograms per mu. Now, plastic film is spread across the mountains and plains of Liangshan. Puge County Party Secretary Ashilaoguai sighed, "This is the power unleashed by our people learning culture."

Even more gratifying is that eliminating illiteracy has also brought about a change in ideas. In Xide County, I met three girls dressed in bright Yi costumes. They were holding "Primer" and were on their way to night school. I chatted with them, "Why go to night school?" They said, "We don't want to be Ayiazhi." "Ayiazhi" is a lesson in the "Primer"; it tells the tragic fate of the Yi girl Ayiazhi under the system of arranged marriages. Now, many girls in Xide no longer listen to "parental orders and matchmaker's words," daring to pursue their own love and happiness.

Literacy education in Liangshan has created a group of Yi script readers, and Yi script news and publishing have written a brilliant page in the history of Liangshan's cultural development.

In the prefectural capital of Xichang, there is the "Liangshan Daily" (Yi script version) and "Liangshan Literature" (Yi script version). The "Liangshan Daily" (Yi script version) with a circulation of more than 10,000 copies is the most welcomed and loved reading material by the masses.

Sichuan Nationalities Publishing House has published and distributed a batch of Yi script books, such as excellent Yi folk literature works like "Amoni Zha" (Mother's Daughter), which are welcomed by readers and become hot sellers in Xinhua Bookstores.

The 120-plus volumes of ancient Yi script classics collected in Yanyuan County are a brilliant gem of Yi culture. Last year, 110-plus volumes have been translated and published using standardized Yi script.

In addition, this county also published 250,000 copies of Yi epic and genealogy, which are deeply loved by readers.

"On one hand, we are spending a lot of effort and money to eliminate illiteracy; on the other hand, we are worried about the 20,000 new illiterates added each year," said Shama Uhe of the Prefecture Commission for Workers and Peasants Education, his voice bitter. The school enrollment rate for school-age children in Liangshan Prefecture last year was 70%, while in some high-altitude and remote ethnic minority areas, the school enrollment rate for children was only 39%, and the school enrollment rate for girls was less than 20%. Apart from ideological reasons, it is also due to the lack of educational funds and poor school conditions.

### 规范彝文“瓦吉瓦”

　　规范彝文“瓦吉瓦”
    本报记者  龚金星
    四十几位汉子，坐在竹核区农民技术学校教室里，面对写满彝文的黑板，或听或记，煞是认真。任课老师马卡拉日告诉我，这些学员大都是新近脱盲的农民。这是记者到四川省凉山彝族自治州昭觉县第一天的所见所闻。
    来自尔古乡的沙古布洛，是这所农民技术学校的女学员，４０岁，两年前脱盲后，带领并辅导６１名妇女先后脱盲。沙古布洛说，脱盲的事，全靠推广使用《彝文规范方案》。我问她：“彝文规范好吗？”她回答：“瓦吉瓦！瓦吉瓦！”意思是：好得很。
    彝文至迟在东汉时就开始使用，但《彝文规范方案》是１９８０年才由国务院颁布的。其间，悠悠二千多年，彝文的发展经历了许多坎坷辛酸。首先是大山阻隔，奴隶主割据，使得凉山地区的彝语方言繁杂，造字混乱，不同地域，不同家支，有着不同的语言规范，严重阻碍彝族同胞之间的交流，也使得彝文自身步入发展的歧途。解放后，彝文的经历也是艰难的，先是在中小学教育中取消了彝文教学，全面推行汉语；以后是推行一种新的方案，以一种拼音文字取而代之，彝文因此几近消亡。只是有了《彝文规范方案》，彝文才得到了真正统一，并进入一个繁荣发展时期。
    规范彝文起始，凉山州能识彝文的只有彝族总人口的５．３％，要在９４．７％的文盲中推广使用彝文新方案，困难重重。州里的决策者们没有因难而退。他们认准要发展民族经济，就必须提高整个民族的文化素质。为抓扫盲，州里成立起了工农教育委员会，彝族州委副书记罗开文任主任，在州教育局设办公室。工作步骤也清晰了：第一步扫盲脱盲，以夜校为主体；第二步稳固提高，以开办农民技术学校为主体。
    扫盲最难的是缺资金和师资。１９８０年扫盲工作全面展开时，没资金，他们便以仓库院坝作教室，纸板、木柜、土墙作黑板，用松明代灯上课；没师资，他们便挑选７０００多名青年，先教他们学会彝文，使之成为彝文扫盲工作的教师和骨干。同时，州教育局还组织力量编写了《彝文规范字表》、《彝文生字表》、《彝文识字课本》、《看图识字》等图表和课本。
    夜校，成了劳作一天的农民最喜爱的去处。１９８７年底，凉山州１４０万彝族人口中，识彝文的已达４４万人，占３１．４％。去年，全州１０个彝族聚居县，已有７个成为国家验收通过的无文盲县。
    先前，凉山的农民不相信化肥，拿了磷肥，和在泥里刷土墙；分配给他们的地膜，全部用来盖鸡圈狗屋。第一批脱盲的人进了农民技术学校后，带头使用地膜覆盖等先进生产技术，使玉米产量从原来的每亩９０多公斤提高到每亩３００多公斤。如今地膜已遍布凉山的山梁和平坝。普格县委书记阿什老轨感慨地说：“这就是我们群众学文化所焕发出来的力量。”
    更可喜的是扫盲脱盲还带来观念上的更新。在喜德县，我遇上三位着鲜艳彝族服装的姑娘，她们拿着《识字课本》，正赶往夜校。我和她们搭话：“为什么上夜校？”她们说：“不愿做阿依阿芝。”《阿依阿芝》是《识字课本》中的一课；写的是彝族少女阿依阿芝在买卖婚姻制度下的悲惨命运。如今，喜德的许多姑娘再也不听信“父母之命，媒妁之言”，敢于追求自己的爱情和幸福了。
    扫盲教育，在凉山造就了一批彝文读者，彝文新闻出版事业从此在凉山文化发展史上写了辉煌的一页。
    在州府西昌市，有了《凉山日报》（彝文版）、《凉山文艺》（彝文版）。发行一万多份的《凉山日报》（彝文版），是群众最欢迎最喜爱的读物。
    四川民族出版社出版发行一批彝文版本的书籍，如《阿莫尼惹》（妈妈的女儿）等优秀彝族民间文学作品，受到读者的欢迎，成为新华书店的抢手货。
    盐源县收集的１２０多册古彝文经书，堪称彝族文化的灿烂明珠。年前已用规范彝文翻译出版了１１０多册。
    此外，这个县还出版２５万册彝族史诗及谱系，深受读者喜爱。
    “一方面是花大力气、大本钱扫盲；一方面又为每年新增的２万文盲大军忧虑。”州工农教育委员会的沙马乌合说起这些时，语调苦涩。凉山州去年适龄儿童入学率为７０％，而一些高寒偏远民族地区儿童入学率只有３９％，女儿童入学率不到２０％。这除了观念上的原因外，就是教育经费紧缺，办学条件差。
