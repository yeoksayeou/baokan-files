	Pravda on Gorbachev's Visit to China: Normalization of Sino-Soviet Relations is the Main Achievement
	The two countries will develop relations on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence

	Today, the Soviet Union's Pravda published a commentary on the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet summit, stating that the normalization of relations between the two countries is the main achievement of Gorbachev's visit to China.

	The commentary pointed out that this is an extraordinary event, for which both sides have shown wisdom, a sense of responsibility, and a persistent spirit in overcoming negative prejudices.

	Pravda believes that the Sino-Soviet summit has brought the relations between the two countries into a new stage, that is, to develop relations between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

	Izvestia also published a commentary on the evening of May 20, pointing out that the joint statement between the Soviet Union and China on the obligations undertaken by the two countries to promote the fundamental improvement of the international situation is an important contribution to the consolidation of peace and security. To achieve this goal, the Soviet side supports the establishment of a new political way of thinking in international relations, while the Chinese side believes that a new international political order should be established on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

　　《真理报》评戈尔巴乔夫访华
    苏中关系正常化是主要成果
    两国将在和平共处五项原则基础上发展关系
    新华社莫斯科５月２１日电  苏联《真理报》今天就中苏首脑会晤结束发表社论说，两国关系正常化是戈尔巴乔夫访华的主要成果。
    社论指出，这是一个不寻常的事件，为此双方表现出了智慧、责任心以及克服消极成见的坚持不懈的精神。
    《真理报》认为，中苏首脑会晤使两国关系进入了一个崭新阶段，即在互相尊重主权和领土完整、不互相攻击、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处原则基础上发展两国关系。
    《消息报》５月２０日晚也发表社论指出，苏中联合声明中所提到的两国为促进国际局势根本健康化而承担的义务，是对巩固和平与安全的重要贡献。为达到这一目的，苏联方面赞成在国际关系中确立新的政治思维，而中国方面认为，应在和平共处五项原则基础上建立国际政治新秩序。
