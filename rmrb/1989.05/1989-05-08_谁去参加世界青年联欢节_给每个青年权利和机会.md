April in Prague is lush with greenery and fragrant with blossoms. One morning, a long line of young people formed in front of a newsstand, eager to buy the day's editions of the *Youth Front* and *Successor*. Curiosity drew me closer to find out what was happening. It turned out that the day's papers were to publish part of the list of representatives who would be going to Pyongyang in July to attend the World Youth Festival.

"Why are young people so interested in the representatives for this year's festival?" To find the answer, I recently interviewed Žek, a responsible official from the secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Youth Union of Czechoslovakia.

Through Žek, I learned that this year, the Central Committee of the Socialist Youth Union of Czechoslovakia changed its previous practice of appointing all representatives from above. Instead, it adopted a system of open competition and selection of the best candidates for part of the representatives. The main conditions for competition are: being a citizen of Czechoslovakia; proficiency in a foreign language; and donating to the fund for the festival. Regardless of gender, occupation, or religious belief, anyone who meets these conditions can participate in the competition. However, the amount of money donated does not determine who gets the representative position. The funds donated by individuals must be obtained through their own or collective beneficial social activities after the competition conditions are announced. For example, workers can donate the income from their overtime work or from undertaking certain projects, while students can donate the income from participating in special labor or collecting waste materials.

Žek said that since the start of this activity, many young people have enthusiastically signed up. The festival organizing committee received a total of 1,870 individual and collective applications. After screening by the committee and verification by local relevant departments, 120 outstanding individuals will be selected from these applicants.

Žek evaluated this approach, saying it "can give every young person rights and opportunities" and "fully embodies the spirit of reform and democracy."

### 谁去参加世界青年联欢节——“给每个青年权利和机会”

　　谁去参加世界青年联欢节——
    “给每个青年权利和机会”
    新华社记者  李玉珍
    四月的布拉格，万木葱茏，繁花飘香。一天大清早，街头报亭前，购买当天《青年阵线报》和《接班人报》的年轻人排成长阵，似乎要争读什么重要新闻。好奇心使我走上前去问个究竟。原来这天的报纸要公布今年７月前往平壤参加世界青年联欢节的部分代表名单。
    “为什么青年人对参加本届联欢节的代表如此感兴趣？”为了找到答案，不久前我专访了捷社会主义青年联盟中央主席秘书处负责人热克同志。
    记者经热克同志介绍了解到，捷社青盟中央今年改变了以往全部代表由上级指派的作法，对部分代表人选实行公开竞争、择优录取。竞争的主要条件是：必须是捷克斯洛伐克公民；掌握一门外语；为本届联欢节捐献基金者。不论其性别、职业和宗教信仰，具备上述条件者都可参加竞争。但并不是谁出钱多谁就可以取得代表资格。个人所捐资金必须是在竞争条件公布后，通过自己或集体进行的有益社会活动得到的收入。例如，工人可将自己加班劳动资金、承包某项工程收入，学生可将参加专项劳动或收集废旧物资得到的收入献给基金会。
    热克说，这项活动开始以来，广大青年踊跃报名。联欢节筹委会共收到个人和集体申请报告１８７０份。经筹委会筛选和地方有关部门的检查核实后，将从中选拔出１２０名优胜者。
    热克在评价这种作法时认为，它“可以给每个青年以权利和机会”，“充分体现了改革与民主精神”。
