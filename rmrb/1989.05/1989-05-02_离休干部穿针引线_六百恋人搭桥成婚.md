Retired Cadres Act as Matchmakers
Six Hundred Couples Wed with Their Help

The People's Daily reports: In Baoding City, Hebei Province, a retired cadre has been acting as a matchmaker for several years, helping hundreds of people find love, and has become a local legend.

The matchmaker, Zheng Lihua, is a retired cadre from the Baoding City Environmental Protection Bureau and currently serves as the director of the Baoding City Retired Cadres Volunteer Marriage Introduction Office.

He and more than 20 partners established the marriage introduction office in October 1986. Over the past two years, more than 2,300 people have registered to find a partner, and 614 people have gotten married through their help.

Zheng Lihua has personally helped 204 people find love, and there are currently 145 couples in a romantic relationship.

Once, a doorman from a hotel asked Zheng Lihua to introduce a partner for him. Zheng Lihua remembered that two months earlier, a retired woman from a recycling company had also asked for his help. "They are a perfect match," he thought, deciding to help.

Zheng Lihua introduced the two, and they both agreed to give it a try. Half a month passed with no news. He went to find the doorman and asked, "How is the retired woman?" The doorman smiled and replied, "She's great, she really knows how to take care of people!" He then whispered, "That night, we drank at her place, and it started raining. She said, 'You don't have to leave...'" Zheng Lihua patted the doorman's shoulder and laughed, "You're hopeless, go register your marriage quickly!"

　　离休干部穿针引线    
    六百恋人搭桥成婚
    本报讯  河北保定市一位红娘几年来为数百人牵红线、搭鹊桥，已在当地传为佳话。
    红娘郑力华，是保定市环保局离休干部，现任保定市老干部义务婚姻介绍所所长。
    他和２０多名伙伴，于１９８６年１０月建立了婚姻介绍所。两年多来，先后有２３００多人登记求偶，有６１４人经搭桥成婚。
    由郑力华穿针引线而喜结良缘的共有２０４人，正在热恋中的还有１４５对。
    一次，有个招待所看门老工人请郑力华介绍一个老伴。郑力华想起前两个月有个回收公司退休的老大娘也曾求过他，“两人是天配的一对”，他这样暗想，决定帮忙。
    郑力华介绍俩人见了一面，都说可以试试看，半月过去无音信。他去找看门老汉询问：“那老大娘怎么样？”老汉笑答：“不错，可知道疼人了！”又悄悄地说：“那天晚上在她家喝酒，正赶上下雨，她说你甭走了……”郑力华拍着老汉的肩膀笑着说：“老没出息，快登记去吧！”
