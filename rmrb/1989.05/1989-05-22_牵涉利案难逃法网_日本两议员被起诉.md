The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office Special Investigation Department, which is investigating the Recruit scandal, today indicted former Cabinet Secretary-General and Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) House of Representatives member Fukuwa Takayuki and Clean Government Party House of Representatives member Ikeda Katsuya on charges of accepting bribes in exchange for services. This is the first time politicians involved in the Recruit scandal have been brought to justice.

The investigation results show that during the Nakasone administration, the two lawmakers, at the request of Recruit Company, actively lobbied to maintain employment agreements favorable to the company. As a reward, the two lawmakers received a large number of unlisted Recruit Company stocks and political donations, constituting the more serious crime of accepting bribes in exchange for services.

Ikeda has already announced his withdrawal from the Clean Government Party, and Fukuwa today announced his withdrawal from the LDP.

It remains to be seen how far the investigation will go.

　　牵涉利案难逃法网
    日本两议员被起诉
    本报东京５月２２日电  记者于青报道：今天下午，追查利库路特案件的东京地方检察厅特别搜查部，以受托受贿罪，对前内阁官房长官、众院自民党议员藤波孝生和众院公明党议员池田克也进行了不拘捕起诉。这是追查利案以来，牵涉利案的政治家首次落入法网。
    特搜部调查结果证明，在中曾根内阁期间，两位议员受利库路特公司委托，为维护有利于利库路特公司的就职协定多方斡旋，四处游说。作为谢礼，两位议员得到利库路特公司大量未公开上市股票和政治捐款，构成比单纯受贿罪严重的受托受贿罪。
    池田已表示退出公明党，藤波今天提出退出自民党。
    追查能深入到什么程度，颇令人关注。
