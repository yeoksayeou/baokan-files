At the end of 1984, the Chinese Culture Academy was established, and subsequently, numerous privately-run social science research institutes sprouted up in the capital like mushrooms after rain. Some said this was a "collective dive" by Chinese intellectuals to meet the challenge of a market economy; others said it was a "green revolution" in social sciences outside the traditional system; and still, others said it was simply a "Nora-style departure" by the individuals involved. Opinions varied, but the evaluation seemed unimportant. In fact, from its first cry to each subsequent stumble and every bit of growth, it should be seen as a stirring wave in the torrent of China's reform...

**A Difficult Choice—From the "Temple" to the Folk**

Thousands of years of Chinese intellectual history show that, apart from official scholarship, there has been no other form of scholarship that has endured.

Under the traditional product economy model, social science research, apart from the "guaranteed survival" inertia and the deductive exegetical thinking pattern, intellectuals' independent views are difficult to play a role.

Once private social science research institutes attempt to break out of this "mistake," their founders are almost all those who have escaped the "unit"—a symbol of all the constraints of the old system—

Zhang Zonghou: A mid-career legal scholar and former director of the Commentary Department of the Legal Daily. In his stable job, he could not shake off the role of writing "obedient articles," nor could he quell the conflict between "independent academic research" and "thinking as directed." Thus, he resigned from his post and came out to establish the Legal Research Institute of the Capital Iron and Steel Research and Development Company.

Cao Siyuan: Known as "Cao Bankruptcy," he is famous for advocating "bankruptcy law." At the height of his fame, he left the highest think tank in China—the State Economic System Reform Commission. As a scholar, he could not accept the administrative constraints of "you are in what unit, you can only do what kind of thing, say what kind of words."

The 21st Century Academy: It germinated from a cultural salon and then became the editorial board of the "Towards the Future" series. When members walked out of official publishing houses to take a new path of knowledge socialization by creating, editing, and publishing books themselves, no one wanted to leave this academic group that broke free from the constraints of the "unit" system, crossed regions, and crossed disciplines, thus forming the youngest "folk institute" today.

Of course, no one could easily leave the temptations of the "unit's" house and position to become an unprotected protruding beam—this requires great enlightenment; no one could guarantee that by leaving the "unit," they would get what they expected—this requires great righteousness and courage.

Deng Zhenglai: One of the few freelancers in Beijing, a "cultural individual entrepreneur." He has been in trouble several times. With the smallest administrative office in the world, he started the Beijing Social and Cultural Research Institute, but to maintain its survival, from the director to all part-time staff, for a considerable period, they had to dedicate all the royalties from their work for the institute.

From being dependent on the "temple" to being independent in society, the sacrifice of personal interests is sometimes also a choice for the scholars of the "folk institute."

**Cooperation and Contradiction—Entrepreneurs and Scholars Shake Hands**

In a certain month of 1988, Cao Siyuan walked into the office of Wan Runnan, the president of the Four Communications Development Company.

Wan: "I have read your book and heard your speech, I like your ideas... If Mr. Cao is willing to come to Four Communications, we welcome you wholeheartedly!"

Cao: "Mr. Wan, I do not want to become a researcher for a particular company. I want to establish an independent research institute outside the enterprise."

Wan: "Please draft a plan for the establishment, let me see it, okay?"

A few days later, Wan Runnan met with Cao Siyuan for the second time. He immediately decided: to support Cao Siyuan in establishing the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute.

History should remember this scene—entrepreneurs and intellectuals shake hands tightly.

For a society to run healthily, it generally cannot do without a group of intellectuals who are outside the administrative management system, have independent views, and a critical spirit. The existence of these intellectuals, in addition to political tolerance, must also guarantee their economic status. Fortunately, in the initial stage of our commodity economy, there are far-sighted entrepreneurs like Wan Runnan and Zhou Guanwu.

However, we do not want to cheer for this scene; it is just one way for the "folk institute" to survive. Although this cooperation is not a "peach garden oath," but a contractual relationship in a commodity economy society; enterprises need decision-making think tanks and cultural representatives, while intellectuals need new spaces and "first driving forces," but one side is a material producer, and the other side is a spiritual producer. The differences in value goals, operational methods, and management procedures between the two mean that contradictions are inevitable.

Li Yongfeng, deputy director of the Cultural Research Institute of the Capital Iron and Steel Research and Development Company, told us: The approval system here and the principle of serving the enterprise often conflict with the institute's long-term macro-research projects, and the solution is sometimes still the "rule of man" as in the old system.

Therefore, we hope that more capable intellectuals will go into business, so that more "folk institutes" can become truly independent economic entities.

Therefore, we also look forward to the prosperity of China's commodity economy, so that academic research can rely on diverse social groups and move towards a broader "folk."

**Lawyers Call for—Thought Freedom**

Urgently Needed Legal "Qualification Recognition"

A phenomenon worth pondering: Among the founders of the "folk institutes," quite a few are legal scholars. Why? Is it that they urgently feel that thought freedom and its expression must have legal "qualification recognition" and be protected by law? But so far, China does not have a "Society Law," and the birth of the "folk institutes" has added a batch of "spiritual wanderers." No wonder these scholars are distressed that the survival of the "folk institutes" sometimes still relies on brotherhood!

A scholar pointed out: We left the embrace of the old system's "mother," not to find another "mother-in-law." The exploration of academic theories cannot rely solely on policy "preferential treatment," but must be placed under legal protection.

In March 1989, on the eve of what he sensed would be another choice, Zhang Zonghou told the reporter, "Whether this fledgling of the 'folk institute' can grow into a soaring eagle depends on four factors: the confirmation of the scholar's personal independent personality, a relaxed academic environment, a strong economic backbone, and the free flow of talent. And these all depend on..."

The gesture of a legal researcher, we naturally understand what it points to, because we are also calling for "this."

**Echoing Far and Wide, Meaning Deep**

—Reflections After the Rise of Folk Institutes

In the eye-catching "National Citizens' Political Psychology Survey" activity, we found the most active figures were the "folk institutes." Keen perception, solid investigation, this marks a new light of academic rationality.

When the tide of "Modernization Research," which is neither "within the line" nor "within the block," spans multiple disciplines and spans the long river of history, in the spring of 1988, the first national "Chinese Modernization Theory Seminar" sponsored by a folk organization was held in the Beijing Jingfeng Hotel, echoing far and wide. This marks a new academic backbone force.

As soon as Cao Siyuan's Four Communications Research Institute was established, it began to advocate constitutional research, and some colleagues initially thought this was a surprising "public relations" trick, with a slight sense of disdain. Later, as the advocacy continued, people gradually felt that this was indeed an important research topic. This marks a new academic value orientation.

In today's basic research that is absolutely unprofitable, Deng Zhenglai's "folk institute" is "competing" to organize nearly a hundred experts to translate and publish the "Oxford Legal Dictionary" (praised as a milestone in the development of Chinese law), "Black's Law Dictionary," and "International Social Science Encyclopedia" and other giant reference books. This marks a new academic pioneering spirit.

Li Shengping, director of the Beijing Society and Science and Technology Development Research Institute, told us: In just two years, the institute has completed 19 projects closely related to reform, and at the same time, translated or compiled 6 sets of series books, with 128 already published. This marks a new academic prosperity scene.

The "folk institutes" bring us everything new.

The "folk institutes" bring us deep thoughts.

We are thinking about one of the problems: The decision-making of contemporary Chinese reform is still largely dependent on the think tanks within the official system, and the "folk institutes" do not have an "orthodox" status, and a large amount of thought and academic achievements from the folk are lost outside the decision-making agencies. A country, if it lacks a diverse, especially independent social thinking from the folk, its decision-making democracy and scientific nature are easily reduced to empty talk. The prosperity of academia needs to mobilize all positive factors, including the intellectual factors of the folk, otherwise, we will find it difficult to dispel the "loneliness" under prosperity...

    已非寂寞开无主
    ——首都民办社会科学研究所采访札记
    黄传芳  张德华
    1984年底，中国文化书院成立了，此后，一个个民办社会科学研究所似雨后春笋，纷纷在首都破土而出。有人说，这是中国知识分子迎接商品经济挑战的“集体下海”；有人说，这是社会科学在传统体制外的“绿色革命”；也有人说这纯粹是那些当事人的“娜拉式出走”。仁者见仁，智者见智，评价似乎并不重要，实际上，从它的第一声啼哭，到日后的每一步踉跄和每一分成长，都应视作中国改革洪流中令人激越的一束浪花……艰难的选择——从“庙堂”走向民间
    数千年中国思想史表明：除了官学，未有能流传深远者。
    传统产品经济模式下的社科研究，除了“旱涝保收”的生存惰性和演绎注经的思维定势，知识分子之独立见解很难发挥作用。
    一旦民办社科研究所试图走出这一“误区”，它的创始人几乎都是那个象征着旧体制全部束缚的恼人的“单位”叛逃者——
    张宗厚：中青年法学研究者、原法制日报评论部主任。在安稳的工作中，他无法摆脱做“遵命文章”的角色，无法平息“独立的学术研究”与“按指令思考”的冲突，于是他抛官弃职，走出来创办了首钢研究与开发公司法制研究所。
    曹思源：人称“曹破产”，以首倡“破产法”而闻名。他竟然在自己最红的时刻，离开了中国最高智囊机构——国家经济体制改革委员会。作为学者，他难以接受“你在什么单位，就只能做什么样的事、讲什么样的话”的行政约束。
    21世纪学院：萌动于一个文化沙龙，继之为《走向未来》丛书编委会。当成员们在官方的出版社外，走出由专家学者自己创作、编辑、出书的知识社会化新路时，谁也不愿离开这个冲破“单位”体制束缚、跨地域、跨学科的学术群落，遂组成目前这个最年轻的“民间所”。
    当然，谁也不是轻易就能离开“单位”的房子、位子等诱惑，去做一根毫无遮拦的出头椽子——这得有大彻大悟；谁也不能保证走出“单位”，得到的就是期望得到的——这得有大义大勇。
    邓正来：北京少数几个自由职业者之一、“文化个体户”。他曾几度陷于困境。凭着那世界上最小的事务机构，他办起北京社会文化研究所，但为了维持它的生存，从他这个所长到全部兼职人员，在相当一段时间内必须奉献出自己为这个所工作的所有稿酬。
    从依附于“庙堂”，到独立于社会，个人利益的牺牲有时也是“民间所”学人们的一种选择。
  协作与矛盾——企业家与学者握手
    1988年某月，曹思源走进四通发展公司总裁万润南的办公室。
    万：“我读过你的书，也听过你的演说，喜欢你的思想……如果曹先生愿意到四通来，我们由衷欢迎！”
    曹：“万总，我并不想成为某一家的研究人员，我想自己创办一个独立于企业的研究所。”
    万：“你拟一个筹建计划，让我看一下，好吗？”
    几天后，万润南与曹思源第二次会面。他当场拍板：资助曹思源创办四通社会发展研究所。
    历史应当记住这一场面——企业家与知识分子紧紧握手。
    一个社会要想健康运行，大抵离不开一批置身于行政管理体制之外、具有独立见解和批判精神的知识分子。而这些知识分子的存在，除了政治的宽容，还必须保障其经济地位。值得庆幸的是：在我们商品经济的初级阶段，就出现像万润南、周冠五这样富有远见的企业家。
    但是，我们不想为这一场面喝彩，它不过是“民间研究所”的一种生存方式。尽管这种联合不是“桃园结义”，而是商品经济社会里的契约关系；企业需要决策智囊和文化代表，而知识分子需要新的存在空间和“第一推动力”，然则毕竟一方是物质生产者，另一方是精神生产者，两者在价值目标、操作方式及管理程序上的差别，意味着矛盾的必然。
    首钢研究与开发公司文化研究所副所长李勇锋告诉我们：这里的报批制度和为企业服务的宗旨常常与该所的长期性宏观研究项目相抵牾，解决的办法有时还是一如旧体制下的“人治”。
    因此，我们热望的是更多有能力的知识分子去办实业，让更多的“民间所”成为真正独立的经济实体。
    也因此，我们期待中国的商品经济更加繁荣，让学术研究依靠多元的社会集团，走向更广阔的
  “民间”。
    法学家呼唤——思想自由
    亟需法律的“资格认定”
    一个值得思索的现象：在“民间所”创办人中相当一些是从事法学研究的学者，为什么？莫非他们迫切感到思想自由及其表达必须有法律的“资格认定”并受到法律保护？可是至今中国还没有一部《社团法》，“民间所”的诞生活像增加了一批精神的“流浪者”。无怪乎这些学者痛心于“民间所”的生存有时还得仰仗哥儿们义气！
    一位学者指出：我们离开旧体制的“慈母”怀抱，并不是想再找一个“婆婆”，学术理论的探索不能仅靠政策的“优惠”，而必须纳入法律保护之下。
    1989年3月，张宗厚在预感到要做又一次选择的前夕对记者说，“民间所”这只雏鸟能否发育成为一只搏击长空的雄鹰，将取决于四个因素：学者个人独立人格的确认，宽松的学术环境，强大的经济实力后盾和人才的自由流动。而这些又统统取决于这个……
    一位法学研究者的手势，我们当然明白是指什么，因为我们也同样在呼唤“这个”。
      声播遐迩，意味深长
    ——民间所崛起后的思索
    在令人瞩目的“全国公民政治心理调查”活动中，我们发现最活跃的身影是“民间所”。敏锐的触觉，踏实的调查，这标志着一种新的学术理性之光。
    当“现代化研究”这样一个既非“条”内，又非“块”中，横跨诸多学科、纵贯历史长河的课题热潮汹涌时，1988年春，北京京丰宾馆内举行了第一次由民间团体主办的全国性“中国现代化理论研讨会”，声播遐迩。这标志着一种新的学术中坚力量。
    曹思源的四通研究所刚成立，就整日价喊宪法研究，有同仁一开始以为这是故作惊人的“公关术”，不免有相轻之意，后来喊得久了，人们方愈来愈感到这的确是个很重要的研究课题。这标志着一种新的学术价值取向。
    在搞基础性研究绝对赔本的今天，邓正来的“民间所”却“较劲”地组织近百位专家翻译出版《牛津法律大辞典》（该书被誉为中国法学发展的里程碑）、《布莱克法律辞典》、《国际社会科学全书》等巨型工具书。这标志着一种新的学术开拓精神。
    北京社会与科技发展研究所所长李盛平告诉我们：短短两年时间内，该所已完成19项与改革密切相关的课题，同时翻译或编著6套丛书，目前已出版128本。这标志着一种新的学术繁荣景色。
    “民间所”带给我们的一切是崭新的。
    “民间所”带给我们的思索是深沉的。
    我们在想其中的一个问题：当代中国改革的决策很大程度上还是单独依赖于官方体系内的智囊机构，而“民间所”没有“正统”地位，来自民间的大量的思想学术成就在决策机构之外流失了。一个国家，如果缺少一个多元的尤其是来自民间的独立的社会思考，其决策的民主化、科学化很容易变成虚应故事。学术的繁荣，需要把一切积极因素，包括民间的智力因素都调动起来，否则，我们便难以排遣那繁荣下的“寂寞”……
