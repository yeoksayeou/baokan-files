Title: How Can a Contractor Dismiss Employees at Will?

Since 1988, we have discovered two instances where contractors abused their power and arbitrarily dismissed employees. This is a noteworthy issue in the context of enterprise contract management.

In July 1988, five employees of the Business Department of the Foreign Trade Company under the Longchang County Foreign Trade Bureau filed a complaint. The contractor, Mr. Xiang, violated the contract terms by dismissing them for failing to meet the deadline for raising 2,000 yuan per person. He then arranged for his relatives and friends to take their places. Based on the contract terms and the requests of all employees, we terminated Mr. Xiang's contract and reinstated the five employees, thereby protecting their legal rights.

The Longchang County Times New Trade Store was contracted to Mr. Liao for operation starting from October 30, 1987. The contract stipulated that the six employees of this store would continue to receive the same economic, political benefits, and rewards during the contract period. However, the contractor dismissed all six original employees, turning a collectively-owned store into a privately-owned one.

We believe that implementing enterprise contract management should balance the interests of the enterprise, the contractor, and the employees. It should motivate both the contractor and the employees, accelerate enterprise development, and improve and enhance the living standards of the employees. Relevant departments should pay attention to protecting the legal rights of employees from being infringed upon when promoting the contract responsibility system.

### 承包人怎能擅自解雇职工？

　　承包人怎能擅自解雇职工？
    １９８８年以来，我们先后发现两起承包人滥用权力，擅自解雇职工的行为，这是在企业承包经营中一个值得注意的问题。
    １９８８年７月，隆昌县外贸站下属的对外经济贸易公司营业部５名职工申诉，承包人向某违反承包合同规定，以未能限期达到人均集资２０００元为由，解雇了他们，并全部安排了自己的亲友。我们根据承包合同规定和全体职工的请求，解除了向某的承包合同，恢复了５名职工的工作，保护了他们的合法权益。
    隆昌县时新贸易商店于１９８７年１０月３０日由廖某承包经营。承包合同规定：这个商店的６名职工，在承包期间享受以往同等经济、政治待遇和奖励规定。但承包人却陆续解雇了原有６名职工，使集体所有制的商店变成了承包个人所有。
    我们认为，实行企业承包经营，必须兼顾企业、经营承包人和职工的利益，调动承包人和职工的积极性，在加快企业发展的同时，改善和提高职工的生活。有关部门在推行承包经营责任制时，要注意保护职工的合法权益不受侵犯。
