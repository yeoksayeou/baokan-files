Arab League Summit Holds Secret Meeting
Summit Postponed Due to Heated Debates

The ongoing Arab League special summit, hosted by Morocco's King Hassan II, proposed a secret meeting this afternoon attended only by Arab state leaders.

Sources close to the summit said that the leaders engaged in heated discussions over the Palestinian issue.

Palestine and Syria submitted differing documents on the Palestinian issue for the summit's consideration. The Palestinian document advocates for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict through negotiations and seeks the Arab League summit's support for the resolutions and political stances adopted at the Palestinian National Council meeting held in Algiers last November. In contrast, Syria's document does not rule out the possibility of a military solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict.

Reports indicate that Egypt has prepared a compromise plan based on the documents from Palestine and Syria, which will also be submitted to the summit for discussion.

Arab League Summit Postponed

The Arab state leaders attending the Arab League special summit decided to postpone the summit's scheduled conclusion today until the 25th.

Officials from the host country, Morocco, stated that the heated debates over issues such as Palestine and Lebanon have made it difficult to reach a consensus, potentially necessitating a 24-hour postponement of the closing session.

Arab leaders held a secret meeting on the 23rd to discuss the Lebanese issue but made no progress.

Lebanon did not send representatives to this summit, marking the first time in the Arab League's history that Lebanon has not participated in an Arab League summit.

Additionally, Tunisian President Ben Ali and Djiboutian President Hassan Gouled left the summit before its conclusion this afternoon.

　　阿盟首脑举行秘密会议
    因争论激烈推迟闭幕
    新华社卡萨布兰卡５月２４日电  正在召开的阿拉伯特别首脑会议东道主摩洛哥国王哈桑二世提议，今天下午举行只由阿拉伯国家元首参加的秘密会议。
    据接近会议的人士说，首脑会议就巴勒斯坦问题进行了激烈的讨论。
    巴勒斯坦和叙利亚向会议提交了看法不尽相同的关于巴勒斯坦问题的文件，供会议讨论。
    巴勒斯坦的文件主张通过谈判解决阿、以冲突，并且要寻求阿拉伯首脑会议对去年１１月在阿尔及尔举行的巴勒斯坦全国委员会会议上通过的决议和政治立场的支持。而叙利亚提交的文件没有排除采取军事选择解决阿、以冲突。
    据报道，埃及同时在巴勒斯坦和叙利亚的文件的基础上准备了一个妥协性的方案，也将提交给首脑会议讨论。
    新华社卡萨布兰卡５月２４日电　出席阿拉伯特别首脑会议的阿拉伯国家领导人决定把原定今天结束的会议推迟于２５日闭幕。
    据会议东道国摩洛哥的官员说，由于首脑会议上巴勒斯坦、黎巴嫩等问题引起激烈的争论，难解难分，可能迫使会议推迟闭幕。闭幕会议可能推迟２４小时举行。
    阿拉伯领导人２３日举行秘密会议讨论黎巴嫩问题，但未获任何进展。
    黎巴嫩未派代表出席这次首脑会议。黎巴嫩不参加阿拉伯首脑会议，在阿盟历史上还是第一次。
    另外，突尼斯总统本·阿里和吉布提总统哈桑·古莱德在首脑会议未结束前已于今天下午离开这里。
