Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 8th. Reporter Mao Lei reported: Supreme People's Court President Zhan Jianxin today at the National High Court Presidents' Conference reminded people that the current national social security situation is quite severe, and in some aspects, it is becoming even more severe.

Zhan Jianxin demanded that all levels of people's courts strictly crack down on criminal activities that seriously endanger social security according to law, and resolutely suppress the arrogance of serious criminal elements.

The reporter learned from the Supreme Court that in the first quarter of this year, all levels of people's courts across the country accepted 81,500 first-instance criminal cases, an increase of 14.75% compared to the same period last year. Among these, major theft cases increased by 78.70%, robbery cases by 59.98%, and intentional homicide cases by 13.05%. The above situation has already attracted widespread attention and strong reactions from all sectors of society. During the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the issue of social security became a hot topic of discussion among the representatives, and everyone generally felt worried about the social security situation.

Local people's courts, based on the social security situation in their respective regions, closely cooperated with relevant departments to launch a series of special campaigns and conduct concentrated strikes, achieving results. Statistics show that in the first quarter, not only did the number of first-instance criminal cases accepted increase, but the number of criminals sentenced to death and other heavy sentences by the people's courts also increased significantly. In the first quarter, a total of 94,800 criminals were sentenced to legal effect, an increase of 14.34% compared to the same period last year. Among these, the number of criminals sentenced to death, death with a two-year reprieve, and life imprisonment increased by 16.94%, and those sentenced to more than 10 years of imprisonment increased by 9.80%. Those sentenced to between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment increased by 24.08%, reflecting the people's courts' spirit of resolute crackdown and heavy sentencing of serious criminal elements.

In analyzing the types of major criminal cases that seriously endanger social security at present, Zhan Jianxin believed that there are mainly the following five types:

	• Major theft, robbery, and intentional homicide cases continue to occur, and especially in major theft and robbery crimes, criminals often act in groups, and some clearly have the characteristics of organized crime.
	• In some places, criminal activities along the railways are rampant. Some criminals gang up to rob passengers on trains, even assaulting police officers, and placing explosives along the railways, causing passengers to feel unsafe.
	• The crime of trafficking women and children is becoming increasingly serious, and the criminal methods are more cunning and cruel.
	• Gambling, prostitution, and drug trafficking and other social evils continue to spread, and there have been new developments in the first quarter of this year.
	• The harm caused by itinerant crimes is increasing. In many places, the major criminals involved in serious crimes are a significant proportion of itinerant criminals.

　　最高人民法院院长任建新指出     
    全国治安形势值得忧虑   
    要求各级法院依法办案把犯罪分子嚣张气焰坚决打下去
    本报北京５月８日讯  记者毛磊报道：最高人民法院院长任建新今天在全国高级法院院长座谈会上提醒人们，当前全国社会治安形势相当严峻，有些方面甚至愈来愈严峻。
    任建新要求各级人民法院依法严厉打击严重危害社会治安的犯罪活动，把严重刑事犯罪分子的嚣张气焰坚决打下去。
    记者从最高法院了解到，今年第一季度，全国各级人民法院共受理一审刑事案件８．１５万件，比去年同期上升１４．７５％，其中重大盗窃案上升７８．７０％，抢劫案上升５９．９８％，故意杀人案上升１３．０５％。上述情况已引起社会各方面的广泛关注和强烈反映。在今年七届全国人大二次会议期间，社会治安问题成为代表们讨论的热点之一，大家普遍为社会治安状况感到忧虑。
    各地人民法院根据本地区的社会治安情况，与有关部门密切配合，开展了一系列专项斗争，进行集中打击，取得了成效。统计数字表明，第一季度不仅一审刑事案件收案上升，而且人民法院依法判处死刑和其他重刑的人犯也相应有较大幅度上升。第一季度判决发生法律效力的人犯共９．４８万人，比去年同期增加１４．３４％，其中判处死刑、死缓、无期徒刑三大刑的上升１６．９４％，判处１０年以上有期徒刑的上升９．８０％，判处５年以上１０年以下有期徒刑的上升２４．０８％，体现了人民法院对严重刑事犯罪分子坚决打击、从重判处的精神。
    在分析现在严重危害社会治安的突出重大刑事犯罪案件类型时，任建新认为主要有以下５种：
    ——重大盗窃、抢劫和故意杀人案件不断发生，特别是重大盗窃和抢劫犯罪分子，往往结伙共同犯罪，有的明显带有黑社会的性质。
    ——一些地方铁路沿线犯罪活动十分猖獗，一些犯罪分子成帮结伙地在列车上洗劫旅客，甚至殴打民警，在铁路沿线安置爆炸物，致使旅客缺乏安全感。
    ——拐卖妇女、儿童的犯罪活动日趋严重，犯罪手段更为狡猾、残忍。
    ——聚众赌博，卖淫嫖娼，贩卖毒品等社会丑恶现象继续蔓延，今年第1季度又有新的发展。
    ——流窜犯罪活动危害越来越大，不少地方发生的恶性犯罪，抓获的重大案犯，流窜犯罪分子占了很大比例。
