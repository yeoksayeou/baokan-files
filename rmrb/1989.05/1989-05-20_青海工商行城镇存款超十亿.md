The urban deposits of the Qinghai Industrial and Commercial Bank have exceeded ten billion yuan. According to a report from our reporter Zha Zhenpu in Xining on May 20, the Qinghai Industrial and Commercial Bank, which had only 1.5 billion yuan in deposits in 1978, had a deposit balance of 10.34 billion yuan in urban areas by early May. This amount accounts for two-thirds of the total deposits in urban and rural areas across the province. Compared to ten years ago, the deposit balance has tripled, providing strong support for Qinghai's economic construction.

The bank's 3,000 employees have been continuously expanding their business in Xining, Haidong, Haixi, and various prefectures, cities, and counties. The number of deposit accounts has reached 2.51 million, an increase of 1.7 million accounts since 1983.
