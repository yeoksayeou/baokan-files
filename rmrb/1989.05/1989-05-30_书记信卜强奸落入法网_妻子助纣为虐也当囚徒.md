The People's Daily reports: On April 30, the People's Court of Xingyi City, Guizhou Province, sentenced Chen Laifu, the Party Secretary of Xiuqian Township, to 10 years in prison for the crime of rape. His wife, Li Xianfen, who was also involved in the crime, was sentenced to 6 years in prison.

Chen Laifu, 43 years old, has an education level of junior high school. He has previously worked as a teacher and deputy township head. His wife, Li Xianfen, 44 years old, is illiterate and works as a farmer at home. On February 19, Li Xianfen consulted a fortune teller about her "eight characters." The fortune teller fabricated a story: "Your husband, from a private school teacher to deputy township head and then to Party Secretary, has had a successful career because in a previous life, a young girl saved him. This girl lives near your home and is now an adult, about to get married. Before she gets married, your husband must..."

Li Xianfen believed this and told Chen Laifu about it. On February 20, Chen Laifu and his wife carefully planned and hurriedly returned to their home in Qiganglin, Qixia. On February 21, Li Xianfen went to a neighboring household to help make tofu. In the evening, she tricked a young girl from the same village into her home under the pretext of asking someone to knit a sweater sleeve. To avoid suspicion, Li led the girl into the house through the back door and said, "I don't know where the sweater is. It's late, and it's not convenient for you to go home alone, so you can sleep with my mother-in-law. I have a headache, and you can take care of my mother-in-law. We'll finish the sweater sleeve tomorrow." The naive girl, unaware of the plot, slept with Li. In the dead of night, Chen Laifu, who was in charge of political and legal affairs as the Party Secretary, with the assistance of his wife, raped the girl twice. The next day, the girl's relatives reported the crime to the police. What awaited Chen Laifu was not a successful career but imprisonment.

    书记信卜强奸落入法网
    妻子助纣为虐也当囚徒
    本报讯  4月30日，贵州省兴义市人民法院以强奸罪判处该市下午屯区区委书记陈来福有期徒刑10年，判处陈来福之妻、同案犯李显芬有期徒刑6年。
    陈来福43岁，初中文化，当过教师、副区长。其妻李显芬44岁，文盲，在家务农。2月19日，陈来福之妻李显芬找算命先生算“八字”，算命先生胡诌说：“你男人从民办教师到副区长、区委书记，官运亨通，是因为前世有一个姑娘救了他，这姑娘离你家不远，现在这姑娘已长大成人，马上就要结婚了。在她结婚以前你男人一定要和她……”李显芬听后深信不疑，回去后便将此事告诉了陈来福。2月20日，陈来福夫妇经过精心策划，急急忙忙从下午屯赶回七舍青岗林的家中。21日，其妻李显芬到同村一户农家帮助磨豆腐，晚上她以请人为其织毛衣袖口为由，将同村一名姑娘骗至家中。为了避人耳目，李带姑娘从后门绕进家中，找个借口说：“毛衣不知放到哪里去了，天已晚，你一个人回家不方便就和娘娘睡吧，我的头有点痛，你也好照顾一下娘娘，毛衣口明天再接。”天真的姑娘哪知其中奥秘，就和李睡下了。深夜，身为兼管政法的区委书记陈来福竟在妻子的协助下，两次强奸了这位姑娘。第二天，姑娘的亲属知道后，向警方揭露了陈来福夫妇的罪行。等待陈来福的，当然不是官运亨通，而是锒铛入狱。
