Every day at noon, the doorbell of Alfred Sampar's home in the German Democratic Republic's city of Halle rings. A woman delivers a hot meal to him. Sampar, a retired worker in Halle, has long suffered from heart disease and recently lost his wife, leaving him without anyone to cook for him. The woman delivering the food is Mrs. Heppa, sent by the "People's Family" organization. Since Mrs. Sampar's passing, this organization has been taking care of the elderly man's daily life.

Halle's population has aged significantly, with those over 60 making up one-sixth of the city's total population. In the German Democratic Republic, it is customary for adult children to live separately from their parents. Except for a few who move into nursing homes, most elderly people live alone. How to care for the elderly has become a concern for everyone in Halle.

"People's Family" is a grassroots organization in the city dedicated to serving the elderly. It has 700 official service personnel, divided into small groups by region, each serving over 1,000 households. Their services include buying food and supplies, managing heating facilities, combing the elderly's hair, trimming their nails, and watering the plants in their yards. The services provided by "People's Family" are mostly paid labor with little compensation, and some are even voluntary. However, participants believe this is a noble and honorable cause, and they all dedicate great enthusiasm to it.

Elke Wesse has been serving the elderly for a full 10 years. For the past three years, she has been taking care of the Bronow couple, both in their eighties. Every Friday, she visits the elderly couple, cleans their house thoroughly, checks all the indoor facilities, and then chats with them to understand their daily routines. In the evenings, she often spends time visiting other elderly people, playing cards, and enjoying a pleasant night together.

She treats these elderly people as her own family. She has also encouraged her three sons to serve the elderly.

"People's Family" keeps detailed records of the elderly they serve, noting their family situation, health status, and relationships with relatives, to better arrange various services.

"People's Family" also mobilizes broader social forces to participate in this meaningful work, such as recruiting high school students and factory workers to serve the elderly in their spare time. This not only adds vitality to the elderly but also cultivates the virtue of respecting and caring for the elderly among the youth.

Currently, "People's Family" has spread throughout the country, with 2 million service personnel, becoming the confidants of retired elderly people.

　　“人民一家”服务热情又周到，被誉为
    退休老人的知音
    每天中午１２时正，阿尔福雷得·山姆帕尔家的门铃就响了，一位妇女给他送来了热饭菜。山姆帕尔，是民主德国哈雷市的一位退休职工，长期患心脏病，不久前又失去了老伴，无人为他做饭。送饭的妇女叫贺帕夫人，是“人民一家”派来的，自从山姆帕尔夫人去世后，这个组织就开始照顾这位老人的生活。
    哈雷市人口早已老龄化，６０岁以上的老人占全市人口总数的１／６。而在民主德国，成年子女与父母分居已成习俗。除了少数老人进敬老院，多数老人都独自生活。如何照顾老人的生活，成了哈雷市人人关心的问题。
    “人民一家”是该市照顾老人生活的群众组织，有７００名正式服务员，按地区分成小组，分别到１０００多个家庭登门服务。服务项目有代购食物用品、管理取暖设施、为老人梳头、剪指甲、给院子里的花草浇水等。“人民一家”的服务是出力多报酬少的有偿劳动，也有部分是无偿劳动。但参加者都认为这是一项崇高而光荣的事业，个个付予极大的热情。
    艾利克·韦塞为老人服务已整整１０年了。３年来，她照顾年过八旬的布罗诺夫妇。每星期五，她来到老人家，把屋子打扫得干干净净，检查室内各种设施，然后，跟老人聊天，了解他们的起居情况。晚上，她常抽出时间去一些老人家串门，打打牌，一起度过愉快的夜晚。
    她把这些老人当作自己的亲人。她还动员自己的３个儿子为老人服务。
    “人民一家”把接受服务的老人的情况做成卡片，记下他们的家庭、健康状况，亲友关系等，以便安排好各项服务。
    “人民一家”还广泛动员社会力量参加这项有意义的工作，如吸收学校高年级的学生和工厂企业的职工利用课余或工余时间为老人服务。既为老年人增添了活力，也培养了青年尊敬和关心老人的美德。
    目前，“人民一家”已遍及全国，有２００万名服务员，成了退休老人的知音。
