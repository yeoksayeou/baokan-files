A lawsuit involving a major Chinese company and a ministry under the State Council was heard today by the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court. The plaintiff is China International Trust and Investment Corporation's Industrial and Commercial Bank; the defendants are State-owned Factory 749 and the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics.

It is understood that this is the first time a ministry-level unit has appeared in court as a defendant since the founding of the People's Republic. This economic contract case, involving $2.2 million, touches on issues related to the state's foreign exchange management system and state institutional reform, attracting attention from relevant parties.

The plaintiff, China International Trust and Investment Corporation's Industrial and Commercial Bank, alleges that the bank purchased integrated circuit frame production equipment from the United States and other places, costing $2.2 million, and leased it to Factory 749 for use. The guarantor was the China Electronics Components Industry Corporation, formerly under the Ministry of Electronics Industry. However, Factory 749 did not pay the rent to China International Trust and Investment Corporation's Industrial and Commercial Bank as required. The plaintiff demands that the defendants pay the rent and bear all litigation costs.

Over 200 people attended the court investigation this morning.
