Athletes Caught Using Banned Substances

	•	Soviet Union: Speed skater Lyudmila Velikova was banned for fifteen months after failing a drug test at the European Speed Skating Championships in Berlin this January.

	•	Greece: Officials from the Greek Ministry of Sports admitted that seven members of the Greek national junior cycling team tested positive for synthetic anabolic steroids. Deputy Minister of Sports Giorgos Kassimetzis stated that these banned substances were clearly provided by the team's coach, Nikos Agelakis, to athletes who were only eighteen years old.

	•	United States: Female sprinter Diane Williams recently admitted to using synthetic anabolic steroids before the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. Her current coach, Pat Connelly, said that Williams made this public to alleviate her guilt and to expose the "cover-ups" in the drug testing during the 1984 Olympic trials.

　　偷服禁药现丑
    △苏联  速滑运动员柳德米拉·弗利莫诺娃因今年一月在柏林举行的欧洲速滑锦标赛上未能通过药物检查，被判罚停赛十五个月。
    △希腊　体育部官员承认，七名希腊国家少年自行车队运动员因服用合成类固醇，兴奋剂检查结果呈阳性。希腊体育部次长乔格斯·卡西梅蒂斯说，这些禁用药物很明显是由教练尼科斯·阿吉拉基斯提供给这些年仅十八岁的选手的。
    △美国　女子短跑选手黛安娜·威廉斯日前承认，她在一九八四年洛杉矶奥运会前服用了合成类固醇。她如今的教练帕特·康诺利说，威廉斯将此公布于众是为逃避良心谴责，同时为了揭发一九八四年奥运会选拔赛药检中的“遮丑做法”。
