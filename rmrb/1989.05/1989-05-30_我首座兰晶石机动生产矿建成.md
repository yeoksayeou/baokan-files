	China's first mobile production mine for andalusite has been completed in Xingtai County, Hebei Province, filling a gap in the domestic production of andalusite.

	Andalusite is an anhydrous aluminosilicate mineral and a high-grade refractory material. It is reported that currently, there are only four andalusite mobile production mines in the world. The Xingtai Andalusite Mine is the fourth, following three in the United States.

	The Xingtai Andalusite Mine consists of 10 ore bodies, with a total proven reserve of 22 million tons. According to the Metallurgical Ministry's Building Research Institute, the products have reached the ministry's standards. The completion and operation of the Xingtai Andalusite Mine have solved the shortage of andalusite raw materials in the metallurgical and chemical industries.

    我首座兰晶石机动生产矿建成
    本报讯  河北省邢台县日前建成我国第一座兰晶石机动生产矿，填补了国内兰晶石机动生产的空白。
    兰晶石属无水铝硅酸盐矿物，是一种稀有非金属高级耐火材料。据悉，目前世界上只有4座兰晶石机动生产矿。邢台县兰晶石矿是继美国3家兰晶石矿之后的第4家。
    邢台县兰晶石矿由10个矿体组成，现已探明总储量为220万吨。经冶金部建筑研究总院鉴定，产品已达到部颁标准。邢台县兰晶石矿的建成投产，解决了冶金、化工工业生产中兰晶石原料紧缺的状况。
