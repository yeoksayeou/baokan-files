Shanghai's branded product manufacturers have strengthened their self-protection awareness and jointly established an organization to protect trademark rights.

On May 12, the Shanghai Jingan District's famous and high-quality product enterprises announced the establishment of the Trademark Rights Protection Liaison Network. Prior to this, Xuhui District also established a Trademark Protection Association.

In recent years, there have been frequent illegal acts of counterfeiting Shanghai's famous trademarks and selling substandard products in various local markets. For example, the "414" trademark of Shanghai's Cuizhong Towel Factory has been counterfeited by more than 20 local small factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The production of counterfeit branded towels is three times that of Cuizhong Towel Factory.

After the establishment of the Trademark Rights Protection Association and Liaison Network, enterprises regularly study trademark laws and regulations, and exchange and discuss self-protection measures for trademarks. The Guangshengyuan Food Factory has submitted 116 trademark registration applications domestically and has been approved for 85 registrations. After obtaining trademark exclusive rights, they have lodged complaints with relevant departments regarding 20 cases of trademark infringement involving the "Da Bai Tu" brand. The Jingan District Trademark Rights Protection Liaison Network has also established a reward system for reporting trademark infringements.

    成立保护商标权益组织
    据新华社上海５月２９日电  （实习生孟宇峰）上海一批名牌产品生产企业增强自我保护意识，联合成立保护商标权益组织。
    ５月１２日，上海市静安区名优产品企业保护商标权益联络网宣布成立。在此前，徐汇区也成立了保护商标联谊会。
    近年来，各地市场上经常出现冒用上海名牌商标兜售伪劣产品的违法行为。仅上海萃众毛巾厂的“４１４”商标，就被江浙两省２０多家地方小厂假冒，假名牌毛巾产量竟三倍于萃众毛巾厂。
    保护商标权益联谊会和联络网成立后，各企业定期学习商标法规，交流探讨商标自我保护的措施。冠生园食品厂已先后在国内提出商标注册申请１１６件，获准注册８５件。取得商标专用权后，他们已就２０起仿冒“大白兔”商标的违法事件向有关部门提出了控告。静安区保护商标权益联络网还建立了冒用商标举报奖励制度。
