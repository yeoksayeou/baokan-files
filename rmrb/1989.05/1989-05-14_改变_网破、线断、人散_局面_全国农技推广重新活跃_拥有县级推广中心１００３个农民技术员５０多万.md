	The situation of "broken network, disconnected lines, scattered people" in the agricultural technology extension system in some parts of China has been improved since 1984. A multi-tiered, multi-channel agricultural technology extension network that connects top to bottom, left to right, and integrates specialized and mass efforts is developing.

	The agricultural technology extension system is an important component of relying on science and technology to develop agricultural production. In the past few years, due to various reasons, this system was weakened in some places, affecting agricultural production. In the past two years, various levels of government and agricultural departments have learned from past experiences and made joint efforts to further develop it. According to statistics at the end of 1988, there are now 1,003 county-level agricultural technology extension centers nationwide that can integrate multiple specialties and promote the comprehensive application of multiple technologies in production. At the same time, various places have taken the work of township and town agricultural technology stations as an important task for "science and technology to revitalize agriculture." In the past two years, more than 6,000 new township and town agricultural technology stations have been established nationwide, bringing the total to more than 38,000. Sixty percent of agricultural townships have agricultural technology stations. Hunan Province has reversed the trend of reducing the number of township and town agricultural technology stations in the past few years, and currently 82% of townships have agricultural technology stations. In addition, village technology service organizations and the ranks of farmer technology personnel have also developed significantly. According to statistics, about 40% of village committees nationwide have established more than 360,000 agricultural technology service organizations, with more than 500,000 farmer technology personnel. There are also 4 million science and technology demonstration households, with an average of one science and technology demonstration household for every 50 households. With the development of commodity production, more than 90,000 professional technical research associations have emerged in China's vast rural areas, striving to provide full-service support to farmers before, during, and after production. These various forms and levels of agricultural technology extension service organizations have formed an unprecedentedly active agricultural technology extension network in China's vast rural areas, connecting top to bottom, left to right, integrating specialized and mass efforts, and providing multiple channels.

　　改变“网破、线断、人散”局面    
    全国农技推广重新活跃    
    拥有县级推广中心１００３个农民技术员５０多万
    本报讯  记者王友恭从农业部获悉：１９８４年以来，我国一些地方农技推广系统一度出现的“网破、线断、人散”的局面已经改观。一个上下相连、左右相通、专群结合、多层次、多形式、多渠道的农业技术推广网络正在发展。
    农业技术推广系统是依靠科学技术发展农业生产的一个重要组成部分。前几年一些地方由于种种原因这一系统被削弱，使农业生产受到影响。近两年各级政府和农业部门在吸取以往经验教训后，经过共同努力使之得到进一步发展。据１９８８年底的统计，全国已有能把多种专业结合起来，促使多项技术综合应用于生产的县农技推广中心１００３个。与此同时，各地都把乡、镇农技站的工作作为“科技兴农”的一项重要工作来抓。近两年来全国新增乡、镇农技站６０００多个，总数已达３８０００多个，６０％的农业乡有了农技站。湖南省扭转了前几年乡镇农技站减少的趋势，目前８２％的乡镇都有了农技站。此外，村技术服务组织和农民技术员队伍也有了很大发展。据统计，现在全国已有４０％左右的村民委员会建立了农技服务组织３６万多个，拥有农民技术员５０多万人。还有科技示范户４００多万户，平均５０户中就有一个科技示范户。随着商品生产的发展，我国广大农村中还涌现出９万多个努力为农民产前、产中、产后进行全程服务的专业技术研究会。这些不同形式，不同层次的农技推广服务组织在我国广大农村中形成了一个空前活跃的上下相连、左右相通、专群结合，多渠道的农技推广网络。
