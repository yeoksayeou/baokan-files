Nepal's Foreign Minister Upaadhyaya issued a statement on April 28, expressing the hope that India would treat Nepal fairly on the basis of sovereign equality, independence, and territorial integrity.

Upaadhyaya made this statement at a seminar on Nepal-India relations organized by the Nepal Peace and Development Center.

Regarding the current trade blockade imposed by India on Nepal, Upaadhyaya said, "Such a situation has never occurred between the two countries before. India's current actions towards Nepal are not friendly."

He emphasized that as a landlocked country, Nepal's right to free transit to the sea is clearly stipulated in international law.

When discussing the assistance India has provided to Nepal in the past, Upaadhyaya said, "Nepal has not asked India for anything it does not want to give. Nepal has also cooperated with India."

He reiterated that Nepal is ready to discuss and negotiate with India at any time and in any place regarding the comprehensive relations between the two countries, including the peace and friendship treaty, as well as trade and transit issues.

He hopes that such discussions and negotiations will help strengthen friendship and mutual respect for complete sovereignty, territorial integrity, and independence.

　　尼泊尔外交大臣发表声明    
    希望印度公平待尼
    新华社加德满都４月２９日电  尼泊尔外交大臣乌帕德亚亚４月２８日声明，尼泊尔希望印度在主权平等、独立和领土完整的基础上与其公平相待。
    乌帕德亚亚是在尼泊尔和平与发展中心举办的一次尼印关系研讨会上发表这一声明的。
    针对目前印度对尼泊尔实行的贸易封锁问题，乌帕德亚亚说：“过去两国间从未出现过这种局面，印度目前对尼泊尔的作法不是一种友好行为。”
    他强调说，作为一个内陆国，尼泊尔通向海洋的自由过境权是国际法明文规定的。
    在谈到印度曾给尼泊尔提供了大量援助时，乌帕德亚亚说，尼泊尔没要求印度给它所不愿给的东西，尼泊尔同样也给印度提供了合作。
    他重申，尼泊尔随时准备在任何时候、任何地方同印度就两国的全面关系，包括两国和平友好条约及贸易和过境问题举行讨论和谈判。
    他希望这种讨论和谈判应该有助于加强友谊和相互尊重完全的主权、领土完整和独立。
