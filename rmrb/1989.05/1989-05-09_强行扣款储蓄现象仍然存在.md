Title: The Phenomenon of Forced Savings Deductions Persists

The phenomenon of forced savings deductions still exists. Our factory has a total of 687 employees. Starting this January, the bank issues 8,000 yuan in prize-saving coupons to our factory each month. If the enterprise does not accept them, the bank will not disburse the employees' wages. To maintain a good relationship with the bank, our factory has no choice but to accept the savings coupons and distribute them among the employees. This has caused significant dissatisfaction among the workers, especially among the office staff. Young office workers who have just gotten married have limited wages. Each month, 40 yuan is deducted for enterprise risk guarantee funds, including 10 yuan deducted by the bank for fixed-term savings and an additional 20 yuan for prize savings. As a result, they have very little left, making it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. We hope that the bank will stop conducting such activities.

　　强行扣款储蓄现象仍然存在
    我厂共有职工６８７人。今年１月开始，银行每月发给我厂有奖储蓄券８０００元。如果企业不要，银行就不发放职工工资。为搞好与银行的关系，我厂只好接受储蓄券，并将它分摊给职工。这件事工人反映很大，尤其我厂机关工作人员反映更为强烈。坐机关的小青年大多刚刚结婚，工资不多，但每月要扣除企业风险抵押金４０元，其中包括银行扣去的定期储蓄１０元，再加上每月有奖储蓄２０元，就所剩无几了，如何维持生计？希望银行不要再搞这样的活动了。
