The illicit detention of citizens in Liling City, Hunan Province, which was reported on the second page of this newspaper on February 27, has been resolved. Recently, the Liling City People's Court made a judgment according to law. The former director of the Liling City Public Security Bureau, Yi Dacheng, was found guilty of the crime of illegal detention and was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. The former deputy director of the Liling City Public Security Bureau, Cheng Chuming, was also found guilty of the crime of illegal detention and was sentenced to one year in prison. The Liling City Public Security Bureau, along with Yi Dacheng and Cheng Chuming, were ordered to compensate the 30 villagers from Xiaodong Village, including Huang Yongfu, for a total of 380,000 yuan in damages.

The Liling City People's Court held a trial for this case from March 31 to April 3. During the court investigation, the municipal prosecutor's office discovered that the former director, Yi Dacheng, was the main culprit in this case. The prosecutor's office made a decision on April 26 to withdraw the previous decision to exempt Yi Dacheng from prosecution and instead prosecuted him for the crime of illegal detention.
