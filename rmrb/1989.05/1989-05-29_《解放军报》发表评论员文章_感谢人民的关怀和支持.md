Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 28th.

The People's Liberation Army Daily published a commentary on May 29th titled "Thanking the People for Their Care and Support." The full text of the article is as follows:

In recent days, many organizations, institutions, enterprises, schools, residents, and students in the capital have successively visited the troops responsible for maintaining martial law to offer their support. Many units and individuals from across the country have also sent letters, telegrams, and gifts of support. This fully expresses the government and the people's deep affection for the martial law troops and reflects the broad masses' understanding and support for the troops' execution of martial law tasks. It vividly proves that the decision by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to implement martial law in certain areas of Beijing is completely correct and has received the support of the broad masses.

People yearn for stability and peace. The support activities by people from all walks of life not only reflect their deep feelings for the soldiers but, more importantly, express the urgent desire of the people across the country to quickly quell the unrest and maintain national stability. Having suffered deeply from the "Ten Years of Turmoil," the people of China have a personal understanding of the pain caused by unrest, and no one wants to see such chaotic situations reoccur. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China has achieved tremendous success in its reforms and construction, but it has also encountered many difficulties on the road to progress. In this situation, it is even more necessary for the people across the country to unite and work together, and to have a stable environment. Otherwise, reforms and construction cannot be carried out, and the country's strength and the improvement of people's lives cannot be achieved. In many heartfelt letters and telegrams of support, the people's desire for stability is fully reflected. This is the will of the Party, the will of the people, and the will of the army.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers in the troops responsible for maintaining martial law deeply understand that the support and assistance of the people are the source of strength for the people's army. In the process of executing martial law tasks, each unit has turned the slogan "Love the capital, love the people of the capital, love the students" into conscious actions, considering the overall situation, and demonstrating loyalty and love for the people. The broad masses of officers and soldiers strictly adhere to the three major disciplines and eight points for attention, not taking even a needle or thread from the people. Each unit has carried forward the spirit of Lei Feng, extensively carrying out activities to do good deeds for the people. The facts once again prove that loving the people and serving the people will gain the people's understanding, trust, and support. The people's army's mission of wholeheartedly serving the people has an unparalleled vitality and appeal. No matter when or where, as long as this mission is put into practice, the army will gain the people's heartfelt love, which will be transformed into a great force to overcome difficulties and achieve victory.

Currently, the tasks shouldered by the martial law troops are still very arduous. We must further study the spirit of the instructions from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, carry forward the glorious traditions of the people's army, maintain close ties with the masses, strictly abide by all disciplines and government laws, and resolutely complete the martial law tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, answering the care and support of the people of the capital and the country with actual actions!

    感谢人民的关怀和支持
    新华社北京５月２８日电  《解放军报》５月２９日发表评论员文章《感谢人民的关怀和支持》。文章全文如下：
    连日来，首都许多机关、团体、企业、院校、居民和学生陆续到担负戒严任务的部队进行慰问，全国各地也有不少单位和群众写来慰问信、发来慰问电、寄来慰问品，这充分表达了政府和人民对戒严部队的厚爱，反映了广大群众对部队执行戒严任务的理解和支持。它生动地证明，党中央、国务院关于在北京市部分地区实行戒严的决策是完全正确的，受到了广大群众的拥护。
    人心思定，人心思安。各界人士的慰问活动，不仅反映了对子弟兵的深厚感情，更主要的是表达了全国人民要求尽快平息动乱，保持全国稳定的迫切愿望。因为深受“十年动乱”之苦的我国人民，对动乱有切肤之痛，谁都不愿再看到那种混乱局面出现。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国的改革和建设取得了巨大成就，同时，在前进的道路上也遇到了许多困难。在这种情况下，更需要全国人民的同心同德，需要有个稳定的环境。否则，改革和建设就无法进行，国家的富强、人民生活的提高都无从谈起。在许多充满真挚感情的慰问信、慰问电中，都充分反映了人民群众这种求安定的心情。这是党心所向，民心所向，军心所向。
    我军担负戒严任务部队的广大官兵深深懂得，人民群众的拥戴和支援，是人民军队的力量源泉。在执行戒严任务的过程中，各部队把“热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生”的口号化作自觉行动，顾全大局，表现了对人民的忠诚和热爱。广大官兵严守三大纪律八项注意，不拿群众一针一线。各部队发扬雷锋精神，广泛开展为群众做好事活动。事实再一次证明，爱人民，为人民，就能得到人民的理解、信任和支持。人民军队全心全意为人民服务的宗旨，具有无比的生命力和感召力，无论何时何地，只要坚持把这个宗旨付诸实践，军队就会获得人民群众的衷心爱戴，从而转化为克服困难、夺取胜利的巨大力量。
    目前，戒严部队肩负的任务还十分艰巨。我们一定要进一步学好党中央、国务院和中央军委的指示精神，发扬人民军队的光荣传统，密切联系群众，严格遵守各项纪律和政府的法令，坚决完成党中央、国务院赋予的戒严任务，以实际行动回答首都和全国人民的关怀和支持！
