Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, May 18th.

On May 17th, an Italian member of the European Commission publicly challenged the Commission's plan to gradually lift the quota restrictions on Japanese car imports over a four-year period. This incident highlights the significant disagreements within the European Community's executive leadership regarding the implementation of trade protectionist measures.

The European Commission's Vice President, Bangemann, who is responsible for the construction of the 1992 Single Market, proposed to gradually eliminate the quota restrictions on Japanese car imports imposed by some member states over a four-year transition period. This proposal was supported by the Vice President for External Trade, Andriessen, and the Vice President for Competition and Finance, Leo Brittan, and was scheduled to be officially announced at the beginning of this month. However, on May 10th, the Commission announced that the proposal would be postponed until early June for submission to the governments of the member states.

Yesterday, the Italian member stated in an interview with an Italian newspaper that if the aforementioned proposal were to be implemented, "it would put European industry in danger in the long run." He specifically declared that, given the difficulties European enterprises face in entering the Japanese market, it would be unwise to abandon restrictions on Japanese goods.

Currently, countries within the European Community that impose import restrictions on Japanese cars include France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom. France has explicitly stated that the Commission's proposal is "unacceptable."

Recently, Western European public opinion has analyzed that the European Commission faces a difficult task in handling trade relations with Japan. It must balance the interests of member states, avoiding "excessive haste" in market liberalization, while also encouraging Japanese investment in Western Europe. The Commission is struggling to find a way to both restrict and open the market, causing it considerable headaches.

　　是否采取贸易保护措施  欧共体领导层分歧严重
    本报布鲁塞尔５月１８日电  记者魏崴报道：１７日，欧共体委员会的意大利委员向委员会准备取消从日本进口小汽车实行配额的打算，公开发难，反映出在欧共体执行机构的领导层中，对要不要采取一些贸易保护主义措施，存在着严重分歧。
    负责１９９２年大市场建设的委员会副主席班格曼打算经过４年的过渡，逐步取消欧共体部分成员国对进口日本小汽车的配额限制。他的建议得到负责对外贸易副主席安德里森以及主管竞争与财政的副主席列奥·布立顿的支持，准备于本月初正式出台。５月１０日，委员会却宣布，此项建议将推迟至６月初再提交给各成员国政府。
    昨天，意大利委员在对意大利一家报纸的谈话中指出，如果照上述建议办理的话，“长此以往，将使欧洲工业陷入危险”。他特别声明，鉴于西欧企业打入日本市场困难重重，要求西欧国家放弃对日本货的限制是不明智的。
    目前，在欧共体国家中，对日本小汽车实行进口限制的，有法国、意大利、西班牙和英国等。法国已明确表示，委员会的建议“是不可接受的”。
    西欧舆论界最近分析说，欧共体委员会在处理与日本的经贸关系上，颇为棘手，既要照顾到成员国的利益，不能在开放市场方面表现得“过于急促”，又得鼓励日本在西欧的投资势头。又要限制，又要开放，欧共体委员会正在为能自圆其说在伤脑筋。
