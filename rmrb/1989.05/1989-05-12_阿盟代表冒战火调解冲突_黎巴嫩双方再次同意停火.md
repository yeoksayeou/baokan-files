Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 12th. Beirut: Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Ibrahim Ibrahim braved the sounds of artillery fire on May 11th, riding in an armored vehicle to the Lebanese presidential palace. In the basement, he met with Lebanese interim transitional government Prime Minister General Aoun to mediate between the two factions in Lebanon.

Ibrahim and three other Arab League officials, who had just met with Muslim leader Hussein, went to discuss with Aoun. As they stepped out of the car to enter the presidential palace, a bomb exploded nearby.

The Arab League officials arrived in Beirut late on the 10th after talks in Damascus with Syrian leaders. Their mission was to consult with relevant parties on the deployment of Arab League observation forces to monitor the ceasefire in Lebanon.

Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 11th. Arab League Deputy Secretary-General Ibrahim Ibrahim announced in Beirut on the 11th that the warring factions in Lebanon have agreed to a ceasefire at 11:30 AM Greenwich Mean Time on the 11th.

Ibrahim said after meeting with Lebanese Christian interim military government leader General Aoun that both Aoun and Muslim acting Prime Minister Hussein had accepted the Arab League's call for a ceasefire.

This ceasefire is the fifth since Christian government forces and Muslim militias clashed on March 8th this year. In this conflict, which has lasted for more than two months, 357 people have been killed and 1,385 injured.

The warring factions in Lebanon had briefly ceased fire on April 28th, but the ceasefire did not hold, and artillery battles continued to occur.

    新华社北京５月１２日电  贝鲁特消息：阿拉伯联盟副秘书长易卜拉希米１１日在隆隆的炮声中乘坐一辆防弹车前往黎巴嫩总统府，在地下室中拜会了黎巴嫩临时过渡政府总理奥恩，调解黎两教派之间的冲突。
    易卜拉希米和其他三名阿盟调解黎巴嫩停火的官员，是在与穆斯林领导人胡斯会晤后前去同奥恩会谈的。当他们一行刚一下车准备进入总统府时，一枚炸弹在附近爆炸。
    易卜拉希米等阿盟官员是在大马士革同叙利亚领导人会谈后，于１０日晚些时候到达贝鲁特的。他们此行的使命是，就在黎部署阿盟观察部队监督停火问题同有关各方进行磋商。
    据新华社贝鲁特５月１１日电　阿拉伯联盟副秘书长易卜拉希米１１日在贝鲁特向新闻界宣布，黎巴嫩交战双方已经同意１１日格林威治时间１１时３０分实行停火。
    易卜拉希米在会见黎巴嫩基督教临时军政府首脑奥恩将军后说，奥恩和穆斯林代总理胡斯都接受了阿盟的停火呼吁。
    这次停火是基督教政府军同穆斯林武装自今年３月８日交火以来的第５次停火。在这场持续两个多月的冲突中共已有３５７人丧生，１３８５人受伤。
    黎交战双方曾于４月２８日实行短暂停火，停火未能维持，双方炮战仍然一再发生。
