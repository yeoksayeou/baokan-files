The "simpleton" Bian Yukuang is the director of the Jilin Province Tonghua Magic and Acrobatics Troupe and an international magic master.

Box office revenue is usually split 70-30, but he reverses it to 30-70, giving the theater the larger share. Every time he negotiates performance fees with a theater, he always says, "Whatever you give is fine, as long as it's enough for the troupe to use." Thus, people in Shanghai call him "the simpleton."

When "the simpleton" was nine years old, he apprenticed to a street performer who did magic tricks while fleeing famine. In the spring of 1981, he sold everything he had to start the "Jilin Province Tonghua Magic and Acrobatics Troupe," with a capital of 6,000 yuan. A truck carried all the members and costumes. Eight years later, "the simpleton" had expanded to a considerable size, with performance equipment worth 180,000 yuan, and the troupe's performances required three large trucks.

"The simpleton" is truly simple. Foreign colleagues are very interested in his art and come to film him. He honestly reveals all his magic secrets, without holding anything back.

"Just practice new ones!" he always says.

For eleven months of the year, he is on stage, but he still goes everywhere to learn from masters. Over a few years, the troupe created and rehearsed four new programs. In Shanghai, where it is traditionally difficult for performers to establish themselves, "the simpleton's" acrobatics troupe has performed five times, each time with a 90-show contract, and every show was a sellout. By the end of last year, they finally bought a house and settled down.

Mastery comes from hard practice. Last summer, Shanghai was unbearably hot. The magician from under Mount Changbai set up two electric fans in front of his bed and practiced until late at night, starting again at dawn. During performances, the second half of the show always featured his magic act as the finale. Despite his size, he moves gracefully on stage. Most magicians dislike having the audience behind or to the sides during a performance, but "the simpleton" is the opposite. When performing "colorful hand tricks," he pulls you close to watch. The audience can't figure out the trick, and he laughs heartily.

Despite asking for little money each time, over eight years, "the simpleton" has accumulated a substantial amount. He is also very generous. From the end of 1986 to now, he has donated 200,000 yuan for a charity performance for disabled people in Dazheng County, Hebei Province; performed 16 shows in Tonghua and donated 1.6 million yuan to support the "Changbai Mountain Theater"; donated 1 million yuan to the Huaiyuan Lantern Opera Troupe in Anhui, and gave them sound equipment worth 2.4 million yuan and 1,500 yuan worth of practice clothes; performed in Siping, Liaoning, and donated 1.6 million yuan to support cultural affairs... Many places where "the simpleton's" acrobatics troupe has performed have benefited from his generosity.

　　“憨大”办团
    唐斯复
    “憨大”边玉宽，吉林省通化市魔术杂技团团长，国际魔术大师。
    票房收入一般是七三分成，他却倒挂三七，让剧场得大头。每次和剧场洽谈演出费，开口总是“给多少都成，够剧团花就行。”于是，上海人管他叫“憨大”。
    “憨大”九岁时，在逃荒途中拜“变戏法”的江湖艺人为师。１９８１年春，他砸锅卖铁自办“吉林省通化市魔术杂技团”，资金６０００元，一卡车装下全体成员和服装道具。八年过后，“憨大”发展到不小的规模，演出用品达１８万元，剧团演出需用三大卡车。
    “憨大”也真憨得可以，国外有同行对他的艺术很关注，专程来为他摄像。他实实在在地把他的魔术秘密让人摄了去，毫无保留。
    “再练新的呗！”末了总是这么说。
    一年中十一个月的时间是在舞台上，但仍然到处拜师学艺。几年里，他们团创作排练了四台新节目，在历来演戏最难站住脚的上海码头，“憨大”杂技团五出五进，每次合同９０场，场场爆满。去年年底终于买下房子，安营扎寨了。
    绝活是苦练而成的。去年夏天上海燠热难忍，来自长白山下的魔术师在床前支起两架电扇，天天练至深夜，天亮又接着练。演出时，后半场都由他的魔术节目“压轴”。别看那么胖，在舞台上却挥洒自如。魔术演员大都忌惮表演时观众在身后或两旁观看，“憨大”则相反，演“彩手活”时，偏拉你到跟前看。围观的琢磨不出“门子”，他便乐得哈哈大笑。
    别看“憨大”每次要钱不多，八年来却积攒起颇为可观的家底，出手也很大方。１９８６年底至今，为河北省大城县残疾人义演捐款２万元；回通化义演１６场赞助“长白山剧场”１．６万元；为安徽淮远花鼓灯剧团捐款１万元，赠送价值２．４万元的音响设备和１５００元的练功服；到辽宁四平演出赞助文化事业１．６万元……不少“憨大”杂技团去过的地方得到了他的好处。
