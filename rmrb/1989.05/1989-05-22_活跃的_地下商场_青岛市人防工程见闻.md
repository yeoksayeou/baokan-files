The vibrant "underground shopping mall" - a visit to Qingdao's civil defense engineering

In mid-April, the Longshan Underground Commercial Street in Qingdao was completed and opened for business. This, the largest underground comprehensive commercial service center in the country, was transformed from a civil defense project and opened to the public as a new tourist attraction, adding to the beauty of this lovely city.

Upon entering the commercial street's entrance and walking through a 50-meter-long tunnel, one's vision suddenly opens up: the entire street is brightly lit, with a variety of goods on display, and customers bustling about. Wang Zhengcang, Director of Qingdao's Civil Defense Office, told the reporter: "The street is 720 meters long, 9 to 12 meters wide, and 5 to 8 meters high. In 1981, Qingdao decided to develop and utilize the civil defense project, and the entire project was completed by the end of last year. Inside, there are more than 500 stalls. Additionally, there is a 360-square-meter dance hall, a hotel with 350 beds for accommodating domestic and foreign guests, and a restaurant that can serve 400 people at the same time, with a total area of 25,000 square meters."

Qingdao has 620,000 square meters of civil defense projects. Before 1978, the state invested more than 500 million yuan annually for maintenance, which was like carrying a heavy burden. With the development of economic construction, civil defense construction began to shift from "emergency preparedness" to a combination of peace and war, integrating with urban construction. So far, Qingdao has utilized 130,000 square meters, developing 132 projects, and achieving good results.

Economic benefits. By the end of 1988, the cumulative output value and business revenue were 232 million yuan, with a net profit of 24.35 million yuan. In 1989, the civil defense output value and business revenue are planned to reach 40 million yuan, with a net income of 3.5 million yuan.

Social benefits. It has arranged employment for 1,140 people. The stone chips dug from the caves were used to fill in 9 large gullies, creating 210,000 square meters of land. Of course, someone might ask: What if there is a war? Wang Zhengcang said: "All open points can be immediately closed." He is ambitious, wanting to turn Qingdao's underground into another vibrant "world."

　　活跃的“地下商场”
    ——青岛市人防工程见闻
    本报记者  宋学春
    ４月中旬，青岛市龙山地下商业街落成开业，这个全国目前最大的地下综合商业服务中心是利用人防工程改造的，作为新旅游点对外开放，使这座美丽的城市锦上添花。
    跨入商业街大门，穿过５０米左右的地道，眼前豁然开朗：整条街灯火辉煌，商品琳琅满目，顾客熙熙攘攘。青岛市人防办主任王正仓对记者说：“街长７２０米，宽９至１２米，高５至８米。１９８１年青岛市决定开发利用人防工程，全部工程于去年底结束。里边设摊位５００多个。此外，还有３６０平方米的舞厅，可接待中外来客的３５０个床位的宾馆，可容纳４００人同时就餐的餐厅等，总面积２５０００平方米。
    青岛市有６２万平方米的人防工程，１９７８年前，国家每年投入５００余万元来维修，等于背了一个大包袱。随着经济建设的发展，人防建设开始从“应急战备”转到平战结合，与城市建设相结合上来。至今，青岛已利用１３万平方米，发展项目１３２个，收到好的效果。
    经济效益。截至１９８８年底，累计产值和营业额２．３２亿元，纯利润２４３５万元。１９８９年，人防计划产值和营业额可达４０００万元，纯收入３５０万元。
    社会效益。安排社会就业人员１１４０人。用洞内打出的石渣填平９条大沟，造地２１万平方米。当然，也有人问：如果遇到战事怎么办？王正仓说：“可立即关闭所有开放点。”他雄心勃勃，要把青岛地下变成另一个充满活力的“大世界”。
