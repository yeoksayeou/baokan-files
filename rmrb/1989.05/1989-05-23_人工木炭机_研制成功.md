Artificial Charcoal Machine Successfully Developed

	The People's Daily reports: Deputy Engineer Tang Hua Rong of the Xi'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Works, Ministry of Railways, has successfully developed China's first "artificial charcoal machine" after nearly two years of painstaking research. The machine passed the preliminary review for a utility model patent by the State Patent Office in late April this year.

	The "artificial charcoal machine" primarily uses waste materials such as sawdust, peanut shells, rice husks, and sugarcane bagasse. Through electromagnetic induction and microwave heating technology, these materials undergo carbonization processing, producing artificial charcoal in less than a minute.

　　“人工木炭机”研制成功
    本报讯  铁道部西安车辆工厂助理工程师唐华荣经过近两年的刻苦钻研，研制成我国第一台“人工木炭机”，并于今年４月下旬通过国家专利局实用新型专利初审。
    “人工木炭机”主要利用锯沫、花生壳、稻壳、甘蔗渣等废旧材料，通过电磁感应和微波加热技术进行碳化处理，前后不到一分钟即可生产出人造木炭。
