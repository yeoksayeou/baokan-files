The third National Environmental Protection Conference concluded today in Beijing. Premier Li Peng, in his speech at the conference, pointed out that we are facing a severe situation of spreading environmental pollution and deteriorating ecological conditions. If we do not pay sufficient attention to controlling pollution and protecting the ecology, and if we do not make great efforts, then the achievements we have made in economic development over the years may be offset by the worsening environmental pollution.

Leaders such as Yao Yilin, Li Tieying, Rui Xingwen, Huang Hua, Xi Zhongxun, Wang Bingqian, Song Jian, and Zhou Jiaxua attended the closing ceremony.

Vice Premier Song Jian presided over the conference and delivered the closing speech.

Song Jian said that although we have done a lot of work for environmental protection in the past, the environmental situation we face is still severe. The general public demands that the government take more effective measures to control pollution.

Song Jian also mentioned that during the conference, students from Jiangsu Road Primary School in Qingdao wrote a letter to Premier Li Peng about environmental protection issues and presented two paintings to the conference. One painting is titled "We Want a Blue Sky," and the other is titled "We Love the Blue Earth."

He emphasized: "Our land belongs not only to us but also to the children. They have every right to demand that we do our job well. Let us all work together to do a better job in environmental protection for the people and for the children."

More than 300 representatives from various regions and departments attended the conference. All members of the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission and many renowned environmental scientists attended the closing ceremony.

The third National Environmental Protection Conference was convened on April 28.

　　第三次全国环保会议闭幕    
    环境污染在蔓延生态状况恶化 
    政府将以更有效措施坚决治理
    本报北京５月１日讯  记者谢联辉报道：第三次全国环境保护会议今天在京闭幕。国务院总理李鹏在会上讲话指出，我们面临环境污染蔓延和生态环境恶化的形势是严峻的，如果我们不在控制污染、保护生态方面给予足够的重视，不付出极大的努力，那么，我们多年来在发展经济上取得的成果，很可能被日益恶化的环境污染所抵消（李鹏讲话全文另发）。
    姚依林、李铁映、芮杏文、黄华、习仲勋、王丙乾、宋健、邹家华等领导同志出席了闭幕式。
    国务委员宋健主持这次会议并致闭幕词。
    宋健说，过去我们为环境保护做了许多工作，但是我们面临的环境形势仍然是严峻的。广大群众要求政府采取更为有效的措施治理污染。
    宋健还说，在会议期间，青岛市江苏路小学的同学们就环境保护问题给李鹏总理写了信，并向会议献来了两幅孩子们自己画的画，一幅叫“我们要蓝天”，一幅叫“我们爱蓝色的地球”。
    他强调：“我们的土地不仅是属于我们的，更是属于孩子们的，他们完全有理由对我们的工作提出要求。让我们大家共同努力，为人民、为孩子们把环保工作做得更好。”
    参加这次会议的有来自各地区、各部门的代表３００多人，国务院环境保护委员会全体委员以及许多著名环境科学家参加了今天的闭幕式。
    第三次全国环保会议是４月２８日召开的。
