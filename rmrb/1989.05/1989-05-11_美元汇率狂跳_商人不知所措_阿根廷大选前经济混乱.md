The bustling streets of Buenos Aires, particularly San Martín Street, are filled with banks and currency exchange offices. In recent days, this area has been crowded with people, causing traffic jams. People push and shove, closely watching the dollar exchange rates displayed on the screens. Due to the drastic fluctuations in the dollar exchange rate, standing in line for a few hours can yield more profit than working for several days. In less than a month, the dollar-to-peso exchange rate has doubled, fluctuating wildly, sometimes by more than 20% within a single day. This is a result of panic buying, which in turn provides opportunities for dollar speculation.

Argentina's economy is highly dollarized, with prices typically linked to the dollar exchange rate. The wild fluctuations in the dollar rate have left merchants bewildered, unsure whether they are making a profit or a loss. Price tags change multiple times a day, but stores often do not display prices, negotiating with customers as they arrive. All stores refuse credit cards, and some have even closed their doors, fearing they might incur losses with each sale. To attract pesos back into the market, commercial banks have repeatedly raised deposit interest rates, with large deposits earning an unbelievable 150% per month. Cash flow is tight, raw material supplies are scarce, and with prices changing unpredictably, many factories have reduced production or halted operations altogether. Essential goods like medicine are already beginning to run short.

Argentina's current economic chaos is primarily due to the inability of the current government to resolve the economic crisis during its term. With elections approaching, people have lost confidence in the government's ability to control the economy and are uncertain about the future government. The current government took office under the triple pressure of a massive foreign debt, high inflation, and economic recession. Over the past five years, although debt repayment deadlines have been extended through renegotiation, the total debt has increased from $40 billion to nearly $60 billion due to borrowing to pay interest. The central bank's foreign exchange reserves stand at a mere $680 million, and actual payments on foreign debt interest have ceased, leading international banks to refuse new loans to Argentina. Argentina's international balance of payments has returned to the dire straits of a few years ago. Controlling inflation has been a key focus of the government's economic policy, with various measures yielding only temporary results. Last month, the retail price index rose by 33.4%, and the wholesale price index hit a record high of 58%. This includes external factors that Argentina cannot resolve on its own, such as foreign debt, as well as internal issues. The government, constrained by various interests, has hesitated in cutting public spending, reducing the fiscal deficit, restructuring state institutions, and improving the economic efficiency of state-owned enterprises, resulting in inconsistent measures. Due to continuous austerity policies, economic growth has been minimal except in 1984. As the government's term nears its end, people, driven by instinctive self-preservation, rush to buy dollars, further disrupting the national economy.

However, it should be noted that certain powerful economic groups, taking advantage of the current government's weak position, are deliberately creating panic to pressure the government into making policy adjustments in their favor. This also reveals who truly controls the nation's economic lifelines. As for ordinary citizens, even those engaging in small-scale dollar speculation are merely struggling in the economic turmoil. Although the government has announced some emergency measures, they come too late, and the situation is unlikely to change fundamentally before the political landscape clarifies.

### 美元汇率狂跳　商人不知所措  阿根廷大选前经济混乱

　　美元汇率狂跳　商人不知所措    
    阿根廷大选前经济混乱
    本报记者  李志明
    布宜诺斯艾利斯闹市区的圣马丁街是银行和外币兑换所集中的地方。连日来，这里整日千头攒动，交通阻塞。人们摩肩擦背挤进挤出，紧盯着荧光屏上显示的美元比价。由于美元汇率波动剧烈，在兑换所前站几个钟头，买进卖出，一倒手赚的钱就比干几天活还多。不到一个月的时间里，美元对阿币的比价翻了一番，忽上忽下，一天中上下浮动幅度常超过２０％。这是抢购风引起的，又为炒卖美元的投机活动提供了机会。
    阿根廷经济高度美元化，物价通常与美元汇率挂钩，美元比率疯狂跳动，使商人不知所措，卖的货不知是赔是赚，一天几次更换标价牌也赶不上美元的变化，于是大部分商店商品均不标价，顾客上门时现谈。所有商店一律拒收信用卡，有些店干脆关门，因为可能越卖越亏。为了笼住涌向美元市场的阿币，商业银行存款利率一再上调，大额存款月息达到令人难以置信的１５０％。资金周转不灵，原材料供应困难，加上价格前景变幻莫测，不少厂家减少了生产或停产观望，市场上医药等商品已开始短缺。
    阿根廷经济目前呈现这种混乱现象，主要是因为本届政府执政期间国家未能摆脱经济危机，大选临近，人们对政府控制经济的能力失去信心，对未来政府又难以预测。本届政府是在巨额外债、高通货膨胀和经济衰退三重重压下开始执政的。５年多来，虽然经过重新谈判，大部债务还本期限推迟，但是为还利息所借外债，使外债总额从４００亿美元增加到近６００亿美元。中央银行外汇储备只有６．８亿美元，实际已停止支付外债利息，国际银行因而拒绝再借给阿根廷新的贷款。阿根廷的国际收支状况又回复到几年前捉襟见肘的情形。克服通货膨胀一直是政府的经济政策重点，几年来采取过各种措施，只取得部分暂时效果。上个月，零售物价指数上涨３３．４％，批发价涨幅为创纪录的５８％。这里面有外债这样的阿根廷本身无力解决的外在因素，也有主观原因。政府迫于各方牵制，在压缩公共开支、减少财政赤字，改组国家机构，提高国营企业经济效益方面，犹豫不决，措施缺乏连贯性。由于连续实行紧缩政策，除１９８４年外，这几年经济增长微乎其微。政府更迭前夕，人们出于本能的自我保护反应，抢购美元，造成国家经济更加混乱。
    但是也应该指出，某些拥有巨大经济实力的权势集团，利用当前政府地位软弱，乘机兴风作浪，有意制造恐慌情绪，要挟政府做出有利于他们的政策调整。从这里也可看出，国家经济命脉究竟为谁掌握。至于普通市民即使做些炒卖美元的小投机，也不过是在经济混乱的漩涡中挣扎而已。政府虽然宣布了一些应急措施，但为时已晚，在政治形势明朗之前，目前局面难以有根本改变。
