Green Peafowl Discovered in Central Yunnan

    Recently, groups of green peafowl have been repeatedly discovered in the ChuXiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture in central Yunnan.

    The peafowl is a nationally protected wild animal. According to records, it is only distributed in the southern Yunnan regions of Dehong, Lincang, and Xishuangbanna. In 1986, during a comprehensive survey of wild resources in the Zijing Mountain Nature Reserve, ChuXiong Prefecture's science and technology personnel discovered traces of peafowl. To date, there are still eight peafowl in the reserve. At the beginning of this year, the prefecture's Environmental Protection Commission organized experts to conduct a survey of the prefecture's wild animal resources and discovered groups of peafowl in the counties and cities of Shuangbo, ChuXiong, Yaoan, and LuFeng, totaling approximately a hundred pairs.
