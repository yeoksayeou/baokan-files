	Starting with "Gentlemen Scholars"

	Qián Zhōngshū declined the praise of being a dragon, which became a famous anecdote in the literary world. Bā Jīn repeatedly stated that he was not a literary figure, but rather that "the pain of the majority and my own pain made me pick up my pen and write without stopping." Great masters of a generation often refuse to consider themselves as "representative figures of the contemporary era" or "those who enjoy a certain reputation at home and abroad." As a form of personal cultivation, this is indeed admirable. In fact, it is not only the great figures of China who are like this. Did not Newton also call himself "a child playing on the seashore"?

	As a group, the intellectual community abroad rarely shows such humility as Chinese scholars. Western sociologists have a lot of discussions on so-called "knowledge elites" and do not hesitate to say that "elite culture" is the crown of national wisdom and leads the masses. In China, it is different. Qin Shi Huang used officials as teachers, the Stone Canal Pavilion Conference and the White Tiger Pavilion Conference in the Han Dynasty were presided over by the emperor to decide academic disputes, the Sui and Tang dynasties established the imperial examination system to weave scholars into the power network, and the Ming and Qing dynasties repeatedly launched "literary inquisitions," step by step establishing the control of royal power over culture. Scholars, like warriors, became familiar with the rules of obedience, one by one becoming heartless gentlemen, who dared not claim to be "elites"?

	The Communist Party successfully led a salvation war with peasants as the main force, and many intellectuals flocked to Yan'an. The indomitable spirit of the peasant brothers made them excited and ashamed. After the war, the tasks of industrialization and modernization were placed before us, and intellectuals, as representatives of modern productive forces, should naturally become the vanguard of the entire nation. However, in a fairly long historical period, we still emphasized the "reformation" and "re-education" of intellectuals. Coupled with political movements frequently interfering with culture, many intellectuals developed a sense of inferiority. They had extensive and profound knowledge but lacked critical and creative thinking, had a sense of mission but lacked the courage to stand alone. A heavy sense of mediocrity shrouded the intellectual community. When they heard the word "elite," many first-class scholars were anxious like lone geese, and some even yearned to hide in the vast sea of people with humility as their "cloak." This is an escape from the responsibility of being the first in the world.

	Comrade Deng Xiaoping proposed a new approach for contemporary China in the reform era, which is that science and technology are the primary productive forces, and we should boldly rely on intellectuals. This is a Marxist observation of the historical trend. Therefore, intellectuals in this period of initial commercial economy and cultural low tide need to draw on the ancient saying of "having no permanent property but having a constant heart" to contribute a long-term vision for national progress and civilizational advancement; leaders also need to respect their cultural individuality, including some temporarily misunderstood transcendent views. After all, cherishing "knowledge elites" is cherishing the future of the nation!

### 从“谦谦士子”说起

　　从“谦谦士子”说起
    祝华新
    钱钟书先生辞谢龙喻，传为文坛佳话。巴金先生则一再声明自己不是文学家，只是“大多数人的痛苦和我自己的痛苦使我拿起笔不停地写下去”。一代宗师往往绝不肯以“当代有代表性的”、“在海内外享有一定声誉的”人物自居。作为一种个人修养，这自然是令人敬佩的。其实不独中国的巨擘如此，牛顿不也自称“一个海边拾贝壳的顽童”吗？
    作为一个群体，国外的知识界却很少像中国的士子们这般谦虚。西方社会学家对所谓“知识精英”有大量的论述，并不讳言“精英文化”乃民族智慧之冠并引领大众文化。在中国则不然，秦始皇以吏为师，两汉石渠阁会议和白虎观会议由皇帝出面裁定学术论争，隋唐开科举把读书人织入权力网中，明清迭兴“文字狱”，一步步确立了王权对文化的统制。书生也像武人一样熟悉了令行禁止的规则，一个个成了心如槁木的谦谦君子，谁还敢僭称“精英”？
    共产党成功地领导了一场以农民为主体的救亡战争，知识分子纷纷投奔延安，农民兄弟的坚韧不拔使他们感奋不已又自愧弗如。战火平息以后，工业化、现代化的任务摆在我们面前，知识分子作为现代生产力的代表理应成为整个民族的先导。可是，在相当长的历史时期内，我们仍然强调对知识分子“改造”和“再教育”，加上政治运动屡屡粗暴干预文化，使不少知识分子养成一种自卑感，知识博大精深却少有批判性和创造力的思想，有使命感而无特立独行的勇气。浓重的平庸意识笼罩着知识界，闻说“精英”就惶惶乎如离群孤雁的一流学者不在少数，有人甚至憧憬以卑微为“隐身衣”而匿于茫茫人海。这是在逃避为天下先的责任。
    小平同志为改革中的当代中国提出了一个全新的思路，这就是科学技术是第一生产力，放胆依靠知识分子。这是对历史走向的一种马克思主义观察。因此，知识分子在目前这段商品经济初兴的文化低谷中需要汲取“无恒产而有恒心”的古训，为民族进步和文明演进贡献一种长远的眼光；领导者也要尊重他们的文化个性，包括某些暂时不被理解的超越见解。要知道，珍惜“知识精英”，正是珍惜民族的未来呵！
