Significant Archaeological Discovery in Han Chang'an: Over 30,000 Pieces of Western Han Dynasty Bone Tags Unearthed

    The People's Daily, May 4th – Over 30,000 pieces of bone tags, which record information about Western Han Dynasty weapon production and items used by the imperial court and palace, were recently unearthed from the ruins of an official building within the Weiyang Palace in Chang'an, Xi'an. This is a major archaeological discovery of Han Dynasty materials in this century, following the discovery of the Han Dynasty bamboo slips from Juyan and the silk manuscripts from Mawangdui.

    The official building ruins are located 880 meters northwest of the front hall of the Weiyang Palace in the northern suburbs of Xi'an. The unearthed bone tags are made primarily from animal bones, mainly cow bones. Each bone tag is inscribed with one to four lines of text, mainly detailing the names, specifications, dates, and the names of officials and craftsmen from various workshops and regions.

    These bone tags, found in the imperial palace's official building, are central-level archival materials and are authoritative. The total number of characters on these bone tags is approximately 100,000, making them the most numerous and extensive among similar inscribed artifacts. The bone tags cover a long period, almost the entire Western Han Dynasty, which is rare among the unearthed bamboo slips, documents, and classics.

    The content recorded on the bone tags includes many details that are not mentioned or only briefly mentioned in historical texts such as the "Book of Han." For example, information about the distribution and production levels of various handicraft industries, the economic organizational structures and financial revenues of the central government and the imperial household, and so on. This fills in the gaps in historical records and has significant academic value for studying the Western Han Dynasty economy.

　　汉长安重要考古发现    
    三万多片西汉骨签出土
    本报５月４日讯  记载着西汉兵器生产及朝廷、宫室用物等方面内容的三万多片骨片——骨签，最近在西安汉长安城未央宫内的官署遗址出土。这是本世纪内继居延汉简、马王堆帛书出土后，汉代考古资料的又一重大发现。
    官署遗址位于西安市北郊未央宫内的前殿西北８８０米处，出土的骨签均以动物骨头（主要是牛骨头）制作。每片骨签上刻有一至四行字，内容主要为上交物品名称、规格、纪年、各地工宫及所属官吏和工匠的姓名等。
    这批在皇宫官署发现的骨签属中央级文字档案材料，具有权威性。骨签上总计字数达十万字左右，是同类带文字的文物中数量、字数最多的。骨签记载的时间很长，几乎包括整个西汉王朝，这在已出土的简牍、文书、典籍中是罕见的。
    骨签记载的内容许多是《汉书》等史籍没有提到或讲得很简单的。比如有关手工业各行业的分布及生产水平，中央与地方、中央政府与皇室在经济机构设置、财政收入等方面的资料等，从而弥补了史料的不足，对今天研究西汉经济有重要的学术价值。
