Wang Meng Urges Strengthening Management of Cultural Exchanges

New China News Agency, Beijing — (Reporter Yang Guoqiang) Minister of Culture Wang Meng, at the recent opening of the National Cultural Foreign Affairs Work Conference, called for strengthening the unified management of cultural exchanges, formulating regulations, and ensuring the smooth development of cultural exchange work.

Wang Meng, in his speech, affirmed the achievements made by various departments and regions in recent years in activating cultural exchanges. However, he also pointed out some prominent problems. He said that the main issues are that some departments and regions, without approval or reporting for approval, have arbitrarily signed contracts with foreign institutions and performance companies, sending art troupes abroad for visits or receiving foreign performing arts troupes and individuals for visits. Wang Meng said: These actions have brought disorder to the work, and as the coordinating department, the Ministry of Culture must resolutely perform its duties, and various departments and regions must also assume their respective leadership responsibilities.

He expressed the hope to expedite the legislative work on cultural exchanges. He said that cultural legislation is a major trend in China's cultural management work. We must gradually formulate rules and regulations to ensure that future work has guidelines to follow and legal basis.

　　王蒙呼吁    
    对外文化交流应加强管理
    新华社北京电  （记者杨国强）文化部部长王蒙在最近开幕的全国文化外事工作会议上呼吁：加强对外文化交流的归口管理，制定法规，保证对外文化交流事业的顺利发展。
    王蒙在讲话中肯定了近几年来各部门、各地方在活跃对外文化交流方面所取得的成绩，但同时也指出了一些突出问题。他说，这主要是有些部门和地方未经审批、报批，擅自与外国机构和演出商签订合同，派艺术团出国访问或接待外国艺术表演团和个人来访。王蒙说：这些都给工作带来混乱，作为归口部门的文化部要坚决履行自己的职权，而且各部门、各地方也要承担起自己应有的领导责任。
    他表示希望抓紧文化交流的立法工作。他说，文化立法是我国文化管理工作的大趋势。要逐步制定规章制度，使今后的工作有章可循，有法可依。
