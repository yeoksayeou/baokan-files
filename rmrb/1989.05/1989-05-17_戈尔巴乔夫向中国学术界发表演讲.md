Gorbachev Addresses the Chinese Academic Community

Three decades after the last summit meeting between the Soviet Union and China, we are meeting with you just as our highest-level talks have concluded. Yesterday, I and my colleagues who are present here held discussions with Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Zhao Ziyang, and Comrade Li Peng. The day before, I had a conversation with Comrade Yang Shangkun. We engaged in an in-depth discussion on the fundamental issues and future prospects of Soviet-Chinese relations, and exchanged views on international political issues.

Of course, we still need to think comprehensively about the various ideas and viewpoints raised during the talks. However, we can already express our satisfaction with the results of the talks.

First of all, both sides agree that friendly, equal, and mutually beneficial neighborly cooperation is in the long-term interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China. The agreements we have reached provide a solid political foundation for developing such relations based on the principles of international law.

The history of Russo-Chinese and later Soviet-Chinese relations has left us with a significant but not entirely similar legacy. I advocate that there should be no "blank spots" in the history of our relations, and that all events, including the most complex ones, should be evaluated fairly.

However, if we consider our relations from a broader historical perspective, it is undeniable that the positive factors far outweigh those of mistrust and conflict. The economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries, the exchange of outstanding and unique civilizations between the two peoples, have brought benefits to both sides.

In the hearts of millions of people on both sides of the Soviet-Chinese border, sincere mutual interest and deep mutual sympathy have never been extinguished.

Of course, what is particularly significant is the two great revolutions of this century that have blood ties—namely, the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Chinese Revolution of 1949. The example of the unity of the working class and the laboring masses in building a new life will never fade from history or from the memories of the living generation.

We have the right to regard the highest-level Soviet-Chinese meeting as an important milestone. A long period of mutual estrangement has passed. We will jointly create our future. So, what philosophical and political lessons have we learned from the past?

I believe, first of all, that we have learned that destroying and deteriorating relations between countries is much easier than establishing, consolidating, and enriching them. Due to a few decisions that did not consider the interests of partners, attempts to impose one's own views on others, push mutual hostility to a political height, and develop ideological disputes and differences into state confrontations, a wall of suspicion and mistrust was erected between two formerly friendly countries.

It is clear how important it is to cherish good relations between countries, strengthen this great national and international asset, and pass it on from generation to generation.

I believe that neither the leadership of our two countries nor our citizens want to repeat those mistakes that are later difficult to correct. Most importantly, we hope that the youth of the Soviet Union and China will learn from this lesson, because the future of the relations between the two countries depends on them.

I believe we should all consider what can be done to ensure that the normal, friendly relations between the two peoples are passed down from generation to generation. This is what the youth will continue and successfully complete the social renewal of the socialist society advocated by the old warriors.

Secondly, we have learned that we must show understanding towards each other's political and practical differences. Naturally, the Soviet Union and China have their own positions and attitudes towards various issues and phenomena. This should not be seen as an obstacle to cooperation. Efforts should be made to find mutually acceptable solutions, while respecting each other's views and positions. This is the only reasonable attitude. Our two countries have come to this significant meeting today precisely because we have each traveled our own part of this path.

At the same time, I think that Soviet-Chinese relations are not isolated but are an inseparable part of the complex international relations. This relationship can only naturally fit into the international system and conform to its positive changes today to become a truly solid and fruitful relationship between the two countries.

Our talks with the Chinese leadership from the beginning have been permeated with the idea that the improvement of Soviet-Chinese relations is not directed against any other country, nor does it require China or the Soviet Union to "abandon" their connections with third countries—socialist countries or capitalist countries, developed countries or developing countries, Western countries or Eastern countries.

In addition, normal Soviet-Chinese relations are in the interest of the entire world community and are consistent with the main trends of the world's development today.

Now I will talk about how we see the prospects for developing relations.

The further deepening of mutual understanding and trust will enable our two countries to concentrate their efforts on peaceful creative labor, increasing material and spiritual resources, and solving their own problems under conditions of lasting and stable peace.

In recent years, both sides have taken steps to reduce military confrontation in the border regions. It is known that after 1985, we reduced our troops in the Far East region and unilaterally undertook not to strengthen land-based and air-based nuclear weapons. According to the Soviet-American agreement, 436 medium and short-range missiles will be destroyed in the eastern part of the Soviet Union. The Soviet military group deployed in this region will be reduced by 200,000 people in 1989-1990, including 120,000 in the Far East region. I can announce that the army will reduce 12 divisions, the air force will disband 11 regiments, and the Pacific Fleet will reduce 16 warships.

In May of this year, we began to reduce our troops in Mongolia: 3 divisions, including 2 tank divisions and the entire air group, will be withdrawn in 1989-1990.

The reorganization of the Soviet troops deployed in the border regions with China has begun, making them fully consistent with the principle of a reasonable and sufficient level of defense. We are ready to further efforts, in consultation with China, to withdraw troops and weapons from the border regions, except for the general forces left by the border guards.

To demilitarize the Soviet-Chinese border and turn it into a line of peaceful friendship—this is a good goal that we can achieve through joint efforts.

A broad field of mutually beneficial cooperation is opening up in the main areas of human activity—namely, the economic sphere. Although the trade volume between the two countries has increased in recent years, both the trade volume and the rate of trade growth are far from the existing possibilities.

In the process of integration, against the background of the rapid expansion of international labor division and cooperation, less than 2 billion rubles of Soviet-Chinese trade exchange seems too little. Moreover, the discussion is about two countries with enormous potential. They have the longest border in the world, which means they have extremely favorable conditions for cooperation.

The potential for economic cooperation is much higher than the current level of cooperation. Of course, even if both sides are very eager to use these possibilities, they cannot achieve them immediately. It is necessary to determine the promising areas, solve the complex problem of pricing, and help enterprises find suitable partners. In addition, it is necessary to have time to train personnel and accumulate experience, because many years were lost in the years when economic relations were actually compressed.

Although we do not set unrealistic tasks, we believe that we can ensure that Soviet-Chinese trade will have a real increase in the near future, which is in the interests of both countries. This is especially true in the following traditional areas: the exchange of raw materials and industrial products, the promotion of energy projects, and the most modern areas of research and use of advanced technologies.

As for the forms of cooperation, with the expansion of trade, efforts can also be made to establish direct links between enterprises, design bureaus, and scientific research institutes, and to establish joint ventures and production units, including those with the participation of third countries.

When we prepared for our visit to Beijing, our experts considered one of the effective areas of Soviet-Chinese cooperation to be the laying of pipelines for the transportation of "liquid coal." Incidentally, this business is one of the areas of attention for the development of modern energy.

There is great potential in the joint development of a new "Silk Road" from China to Europe, the Beijing-Urumqi-Almaty-Moscow railway line. An important section of this road will be completed in the near future.

Long-term cooperation between the Far East, Siberia, and the various regions of the Soviet Union with the northeastern provinces of China, the Kazakh Republic, the Central Asian Republics of the Soviet Union with the northwestern provinces and autonomous regions of China will play an important role in the development of business ties between the two countries.

We view the expansion and deepening of Soviet-Chinese economic and trade ties from the perspective of the increasingly emerging process of Asian economic integration. Currently, in our country, we are paying attention to and analyzing the experience of China's policy of opening up to the outside world, and considering the establishment of economic zones, including a series of border areas adjacent to China.

In this hall, there are many famous Chinese scholars, cultural figures, and representatives of the Soviet scientific and artistic community who have come with us. I would like to say now, when the Soviet Union and China seem to be getting to know each other again, that the mission of our two countries—to promote mutual understanding between peoples—is particularly important at present.

Mutual contacts and joint research by Soviet and Chinese scholars bring benefits to both sides. Not long ago, the Soviet Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Sciences signed an agreement on the main directions of cooperation. I am convinced that scientists, through joint efforts, will increase their contribution to the acceleration of socio-economic development in the two countries.

In the cultural sphere, we have an invaluable treasure of spiritual exchange, which is primarily the tradition of literary and artistic exchanges.

In our country, the famous Chinese writer Lu Xun wrote: "I feel that there is some connection between China and Russia, and their cultures and histories have many similarities." We cherish the efforts of modern Chinese artists and translators who have made Russian and Soviet literary works a treasure for Chinese readers.

In the Soviet Union, there is a special interest in the unique ancient culture of China. Chinese art exhibitions are increasingly frequent in Moscow's various museums and the Hermitage in Leningrad. Traditional Chinese medicine is also very popular. The "Chinese Literature Series" published in the Soviet Union, 40 volumes, has been enthusiastically received by Soviet readers.

Contacts between social figures, culture, art, and science, and the broad exchange of people, all make our relations more substantial, and equally importantly, more open and democratic.

Currently, there is also the possibility of mutually beneficial cooperation in the exchange of experience in economic, social, and socio-political reforms.

China's economic reforms, which began earlier than the Soviet Union, are of great interest to the Soviet Union. In a vast country that has been in a state of self-seclusion and semi-colonial backwardness for many centuries, the courage of the party and the people to undertake a deep reform of the social mechanism to modernize is admirable.

We are familiar with the significant achievements you have made on this path and the difficulties you have encountered. Comrades, we sincerely and friendly wish you to continue steadfastly towards your main goal, to turn the People's Republic of China into a developed, modern socialist country.

Generally speaking, it is not necessary to judge a country's situation and capabilities solely by the average production and consumption per capita and how they compare with the world's advanced countries. It is important to see in which direction the country is developing and to continuously pave the way for this development.

As for the difficulties, it is natural that in the complex matter of establishing a new social system. We understand this very well from our own experience.

Our economic, scientific, and technological potential, as well as our social achievements, are well known. However, the speed and quality of our development began to decline in the 1970s. Analysis shows that, although negatively affected, the essence of the matter is not just in minor flaws and mistakes.

The main root of the problem lies in the shortcomings of the command-bureaucratic system that formed in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Only by dismantling this system and fully restoring the effectiveness of Lenin's ideas and socialist principles can the country get out of the deadlock and prevent the impending crisis. The planning of revolutionary reforms was thus born.

Based on the knowledge and experience accumulated over the four years since the April Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee in 1985, I am now talking about this. However, the recognition of these facts themselves did not come all at once. The party and the people, step by step, like climbing a staircase, approached their "moment of truth."

We had set the task of starting with the consolidation of the most basic discipline, namely, the consolidation of labor, production, and financial discipline. But it quickly became clear that by taking these measures alone, many goals could not be achieved. Only by eliminating the phenomenon of workers being alienated from property, only by their sense of ownership in their own factories and enterprises, collective farms and state farms, institutes and research institutes, can the cause be truly advanced.

Life itself led to the conclusion that a thorough reform of the entire economic system was necessary, to turn enterprises to full economic accounting, self-financing, self-reliance, to create conditions for the development of cooperative sectors, and to widely use the lever of commodity-money relations.

In the reform of the economic management system, a particularly important role was played by the aspect of the reasonable proportion between the functions of central departments and local authorities. We have set the course to decisively increase the economic autonomy of the union republics, expand the economic capabilities of local Soviets, and at the same time strengthen their responsibility for meeting the needs of the population. Of course, this does not mean weakening the coordinating and regulatory functions of the central authorities. Without this, no modern state can develop smoothly.

The problem of eliminating egalitarianism and implementing the socialist principle of distribution according to work is also urgent. High-quality and high-productivity labor, highly skilled, professional work should receive appropriate remuneration. At the same time, we believe that it is necessary to strengthen the protection of Soviet citizens by society, to guarantee each worker a minimum standard of living.

After we passed a series of legal documents on the transition to a new management system, it quickly became clear that economic system reform could not be implemented without radical political system reform measures.

If the working people can influence the management decisions and participate in the elections of leaders at all levels, if we can organically combine socialism with democracy, then the workers can truly feel that they are the common owners of national wealth. This is one of the most important conclusions of the 19th Party Congress of the CPSU, which was held last summer. Less than a year later, we held democratic elections for the first time in decades.

Comrades, you probably know that next week in Moscow, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR will be convened, which will form a new government, determine the main directions of the internal and external policy of the Soviet state, and in fact, infuse new vitality into the entire state mechanism.

The next stage of political system reform will solve another equally important task of harmonizing inter-ethnic relations. The widely supported formula for the development of the Soviet federal system is a powerful center and powerful union republics.

In fully developing the democratization of our political system, our starting point is that the responsibility of all members of society for the healthy development of society and its socio-political stability should be increased. Without guaranteeing this, the normal process of reform is unimaginable. Therefore, we attach great importance to strengthening the rule of law, social order, and creating other conditions necessary for the establishment of a socialist rule-of-law state.

All these reforms, if they were to proceed smoothly and comfortably, would be contrary to the facts.

Let us look at the dialectics of this process. The social mechanism that is being formed should ensure the consideration of the interests of all strata of society, that is, the interests of the working class, peasants, intellectuals, union republics and autonomous republics, and various national minorities. However, these mechanisms have not yet fully formed and have not yet fully functioned. At the same time, in the conditions of openness and pluralism, the unresolved problems that have accumulated over the decades have been exposed. People's expectations often outpace the speed of reform.

We do not dramatize the situation and fully understand the legitimate desire of the working people to see the results of the reform as soon as possible. We are doing our utmost to accelerate the reform of various aspects of state and social life. However, it is also necessary to consider that the process of social development, like the process of natural development, has a natural time extension. No matter how much we want, it takes three or four years of the most intense work, and it cannot be done in one year.

It is well known that the attempt to rush the historical torrent forward will cost a high price. However, in politics, economics, and other aspects, it is also not possible to let things take their course. When the machine is adjusted, it will run normally by itself. However, to start this machine, a lot of effort is needed.

In short, a comprehensive reform strategy is needed. In this case, the role of the party has a particularly important significance.

The CPSU has initiated reforms, dared to resolutely and uncompromisingly expose the distortions of socialism that have formed in the past. The party has developed and presented to society the concept of fundamental reforms of the economic and political system. Now the party has become the only cohesive force that can ensure the successful completion of our socialist reforms.

While reforming itself, the party, on the basis of Leninist principles, improves its relations with the state, more fully plays its role as the political vanguard of society.

Before concluding my remarks on the situation in our country, I would like to emphasize that the entire concept of reform is based on loyalty to the socialist choice made by the people in October 1917.

It is well known that the West is very interested in our reforms, in the similar reforms in China and other socialist countries. They are debating the question: to what extent have these processes developed socialism? To what extent have they deviated from socialism? Some openly hope that the expansion of economic accounting relations and the market, openness, and democracy will lead to the creation of some hybrid social system, even to the restoration of capitalism.

Such estimates are based on the erroneous view that economic levers and democracy are absolutely the essential attributes of capitalism. In fact, these are just ways of regulating social relations that humanity has developed over its long history and can be used under different social systems. Of course, it is also necessary to consider the characteristics of each social system.

We are convinced that socialism can and will achieve an organic combination of economic and political democracy, social guarantees for people, and human freedom. This is the goal of all our work to renew society.

Next, I would like to touch on another fundamental issue related to reform.

We view this process as our own, Soviet, and do not want to impose it on any other country in the slightest. Even imposing a model, and moreover, not a perfect one, on others, or copying a model, has been the cause of many frictions in the development of world socialism in the past.

We have firmly grasped this lesson. We establish relations with all other socialist countries on the basis of fully respecting the independence and the autonomous right to choose the path and methods of social development.

Our party also proceeds from the above principles when developing relations with the Communist and Workers' Parties. We have agreed with the Chinese comrades to develop the ties between the CPSU and the CPC on the basis of complete equality.

Currently, a series of socialist countries have processes similar to ours, both in content and sometimes in form. This once again proves that it is necessary to more actively exchange experiences and learn from each other, on the one hand, creatively absorbing the best from the world socialist practice, and on the other hand, avoiding repeating mistakes.

The reforms of the Soviet Union, China, and many other socialist countries have broken the erroneous concept of socialism as a monolithic, unchanging system and have proven that socialism has the ability to develop and improve itself.

The twentieth century has shown how difficult it is to realize the human ideal of a beautiful future. Our current concept of building a new society differs from the concept of the nineteenth century when socialism began to transition from utopia to science, and more complex tasks are presented before us.

However, we are now rich with invaluable practical experience. While abandoning illusions, shedding dogmas and distortions, today's, that is, the end-of-the-century socialism is undergoing a comprehensive renewal. To enrich a progressive social system with all the achievements of human civilization in economics, culture, science, technology, politics, and law—this is both a noble and inspiring goal!

Honorable comrades!

The process of renewing socialism is taking place against the background of a worldwide, historically significant transformation. For the first time in human history, humanity has encountered the problem of survival.

The right to survival itself has acquired a new meaning and has become a problem that needs to be solved globally. One cannot escape the nuclear storm in one's own country. One cannot ensure clean air in one's own country, prevent the spread of AIDS, or protect oneself from the danger of terrorism.

From this obviously determined fact, one can naturally derive a general formula: in today's interdependent world, narrow-minded national isolationist development is no longer possible. The survival of humanity and the progress of civilization created by it can only be the result of the joint efforts of the peoples of all countries.

But the question is: how to combine this important trend in the development of modern society—the establishment of national self-awareness of the peoples of all countries and the absolute right to freely choose their own path—with this?

The world is becoming more integrated, metaphorically speaking, it is "shrinking," while at the same time, it is becoming more diverse, as if it is "expanding." One of the real contradictions of our time lies in this. This contradiction cannot be ignored. Attempts to eliminate this contradiction by force and impose this or that social system on the peoples of various countries, or to prescribe the actions of a certain gathering of great powers, are extremely dangerous. No, the Gordian knot of the present age cannot be cut with one stroke; it must be carefully untied.

In the current diverse world, there is only one way to solve real contradictions, which is to solve them on the basis of a balance of interests and equal partnership cooperation. It seems that politicians and diplomats have never solved such a complex task. Because the interests of more than 150 countries are at stake, and moreover, the interests of countries at different stages of development according to the "global clock" of history.

However, as we see it, there is no other way. Only the unity of truly independent countries can strive for the real stability of interdependence needed by the world today.

I think this is particularly evident in the vast Asia-Pacific region, where different social systems and eras "converge," where ancient civilizations and the breakthroughs of the 21st-century technology are close to each other.

In Asia, there are many sources of military tension that can flare up at any time. At the same time, it is precisely here that Zhou Enlai and Nehru formulated the "Panchsheela"—the five principles of peaceful coexistence. The traditional concept of non-violence in India and the ancient Chinese concept of "ren" philosophy are in harmony with the current world's search and worries.

If this continent, where the majority of the world's population lives and where different forces intersect, plays a certain role of a "crucible" due to its geography and history, then these words probably will not be too exaggerated. The process of this "crucible" to a large extent predetermines the fate of all mankind.

Can we view these processes from the perspective that different systems, ideologies, and civilizations will definitely not be compatible and will definitely fight against each other? I think such an attitude is fatal.

We are convinced that there is a real possibility and necessity to find common ground among diverse interests and positions. For this, first of all, it is necessary to overcome any attempts at hegemony and pressure, and exclude any actions of interference in internal affairs.

Can one country act as the guarantor of strategic, socio-economic, and political security in the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean regions? Obviously, no. Only the collective efforts of all the countries in these regions can guarantee true security and stability.

In my speeches in Vladivostok and Krasnoyarsk, I called on everyone to work together to find ways to reform the relations between the countries of the Asia-Pacific region, to prevent this region from becoming a dangerous battlefield of military confrontation, and to invite everyone to think together about how to solve regional conflicts, stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons, limit naval activities, reduce armed forces, and take confidence-building measures.

The solution of common tasks largely depends on bilateral relations between countries, this is not in doubt. From this point of view, we attach great importance to the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and all countries in the Asia-Pacific region.

The normalization of Soviet-Chinese relations is undoubtedly the most significant event in recent times.

In recent years, we have continued to strengthen our traditional cooperation with India. The Soviet-Indian declaration on a nuclear-free, non-violent peace signed by me and Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi has received a wide response from the international political community and various sectors of society.

We continue to deepen mutual understanding with other countries in this region that have already established good relations with us. With countries that have only had formal, diplomatic contacts with us, we are beginning a more active dialogue. We have taken steps towards countries where there has been a lack of mutual understanding.

This primarily concerns relations with Japan. We have great respect for this country and want to establish comprehensive relations with it. Of course, there are still some problems in this regard. Soviet-Japanese cooperation can bring a lot to both countries and become an important positive factor for peace and development in Asia. Recently, some conditions for this have been accumulated, but to realize these conditions, both sides still need to do a lot of work.

It is well known that what changes have taken place in Soviet-American relations. It is not necessary to prove that this is in the interest of the entire international community and opens up further possibilities for solving problems in Asia and the Pacific region. I agreed with US President Bush to act in the spirit of continuity, to consolidate the constructive results already achieved. The recent talks in Moscow reaffirmed this desire of both sides. We advocate that the positive trend of moving from confrontation to cooperation can find its way, gradually stabilize, and take the dominant position.

In our policy towards Asia, an important place is occupied by assisting in the elimination of the hotbeds of conflict and tension that exist in Asia.

Since the Soviet Union withdrew its troops from Afghanistan, three months have passed. However, the situation in this country is becoming increasingly alarming.

We believe that the time has come for the international community to take a more active stance on this threat to the fire-like conflict that endangers all surrounding regions. Different attitudes can be taken towards the current authorities in Afghanistan, but it is clear that the issue of who wins and who loses among the opposing factions within Afghanistan should be left for them to decide. It is the Afghan people who have the right to decide what kind of country Afghanistan should be.

For ten years, the situation around Cambodia has been one of the sore points on the Asian continent, and now it is a matter of joy that there is "light at the end of the tunnel."

Of course, it is unreasonable to talk about things without reason. To solve the Cambodian problem, a lot of political and diplomatic efforts are still needed. However, the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops by September this year will create a new situation here, which will create actual conditions for the final resolution of this long-overdue conflict.

We have discussed these issues with the Cambodian and Vietnamese comrades, and yesterday we also discussed them with the leaders of your country. The impression is that the solution to the Cambodian problem is gradually taking shape, and its possible stages are beginning to become clearer.

As for the most important principles that can and should be the basis for solving this problem, this is still the only fair principle of national self-determination. Only the Cambodian people themselves can find the formula for the future and reconciliation of their country and political system.

For the Soviet Union, it is ready to participate in relevant international guarantee measures and respect any choice of the Cambodian people, it advocates the policy of independence, neutrality, and non-alignment.

I would like to reiterate our unwavering support for the efforts of the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the peaceful and democratic unification of Korea. Obviously, to achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate the tension on the peninsula and withdraw American troops, whose presence here has long been unreasonable.

There is no established negotiating structure in the Asia-Pacific region, nor is there a mechanism for regular multilateral consultations. So, is the time ripe for all interested countries, with the support and assistance of the United Nations, to jointly promote what can be called the "whole Asia process"?

This idea has not yet received a universally positive response. Some countries believe that the time for implementing this idea has not yet come, and that good conditions must be prepared first, and that the potential sources of conflict here must be eliminated first. But we believe that it will be much easier to complete this task, which is very important for Asia and the world, through joint efforts.

By the way, the prospects for solving the Cambodian problem are not an example of this! It is precisely because almost all the countries in the Asia-Pacific region, and not just these countries, have made efforts to participate in the solution, that there is a possibility of a solution.

This is also natural. Asia is not isolated from other continents, and its connections include an increasingly wide range—from economic exchanges to cultural penetration.

Due to the geographical position of the Soviet Union, we have a particularly close relationship with Eurasia. The "bridge" connecting the two continents of culture, so to speak, both crosses our vast land and crosses our spiritual life.

Currently, the Pacific Ocean to the east is not separating Asia from America like an obstacle, but rather playing a mediating role. Therefore, the security of Asia is a component of universal, global security.

Along with the issue of peace, the issue of development is particularly acute in Asia and Africa. Regions of hunger, poverty, illiteracy, and infectious diseases are concentrated on these two continents. It is known that the tragic roots of millions of people lie in colonialism and neo-colonialism, as well as in the huge gap between developed and developing countries. Despite many efforts made in the past, this gap continues to widen under the influence of the "noose" of huge external debts that are strangling the debtor countries.

It should be emphasized that there is a gap not only in per capita national income, that is, in the relationship between wealth and poverty. More worrying is the huge gap in technological levels, which in essence deprives backward countries of the opportunity to catch up with advanced countries, thus seemingly preserving the division between prosperous and poor countries forever.

We believe that the entire world public opinion, every person, must understand that such a situation cannot continue indefinitely. In essence, it is equivalent to a nuclear or ecological threat and can cause an explosion.

What attitude can be taken towards this most acute problem? We believe that it is necessary to start by rejecting extreme methods. It is unrealistic to hope for the redistribution of wealth and the establishment of some international egalitarianism. The plans of wealthy countries to hide in fortresses or to drive away poor countries with small favors are equally unfounded. Once a disaster occurs, it will inevitably involve all of humanity.

The only fair and reasonable solution is to seek it on the path of strengthening common assistance for development. For the solution of the most striking social problems, voluntary international joint efforts are possible and necessary. This is on the basis of respecting independence and the right to national self-determination.

We fully support the comprehensive opinions proposed by the Non-Aligned Movement for this. Recently, many political currents have also proposed beneficial initiatives in this direction.

Of course, for us, loyal members of the international proletarian solidarity, participating in this noble cause is a matter of faith and duty.

In our view, among the initiatives for active development, the initiative worth noting is the establishment of a world advanced technology repository based on a very simple principle. This is that all countries, companies, organizations, and individuals can voluntarily deposit funds in this repository. At the same time, they all have the opportunity to use this knowledge and experience treasure free of charge or at a very low cost for development purposes.

This proposal is not something completely new. There are already many various funds in the world that work on the same principle. What is said here is to turn this business into a global one.

It seems that this proposal is in line with the new international political system. We had a rich discussion with the Chinese leadership on this issue.

Honorable comrades!

When considering the complex problems facing the modern world, one can conclude: the progress of civilization and its breakthrough to new heights have never had such great possibilities. At the same time, the retreat of humanity and even the threat to its very existence have never been so serious.

Under these circumstances, all countries and governments, parties, and social movements must take great responsibility for their decisions and actions. We must use this historic opportunity for the benefit of the present and future generations.

I express the hope and belief that in the struggle for the future, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China will actively cooperate. Our two countries will make appropriate contributions to the problems that the world community should solve.

We wish the friendly Chinese people prosperity and strength, and wish every family happiness and all the best.

　　戈尔巴乔夫向中国学术界发表演讲
    新华社北京５月１７日电苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天在人民大会堂对中国学术界发表的演讲如下：
    三十年来首次举行的苏中最高级会晤刚一结束我们就与你们会见。
    昨天一天，我与这里在坐的我的同事们同邓小平同志、赵紫阳同志和李鹏同志举行了会谈。前一天还与杨尚昆同志进行了谈话。我们深入讨论了苏联和中国关系的原则问题和发展前景，并就国际政治问题交换了意见。
    当然我们还需要全面思考会谈中提出的各种设想和观点。不过现在就可以表示，我们对会谈的结果很满意。
    首先双方都同意两国睦邻、平等、互利合作符合苏中两国人民的长远利益。我们之间达成的协议为我们根据国际法原则发展这种关系打下了深厚的政治基础。
    俄中和后来的苏中关系史给我们留下了很大的却不尽相同的遗产。我主张，关系史上不要留下“空白点”，主张对所有的，其中包括最复杂的事件作出公正的评价。
    但是，如果从历史的大的尺度去处理我们的关系，那么，勿庸置疑，积极的因素大大地超过不信任和冲突造成的因素。两国的经济文化交流，创造了杰出和各具特色的文明的两国人民之间的往来给双方都带来了很多好处。
    在苏中边界两侧的千百万人的心中，真诚的相互兴趣，深切的相互同情从未熄灭。
    当然，具有特别意义的还是本世纪具有血缘关系的两大革命——这就是俄国１９１７年的革命和中国１９４９年的革命。走上建设新生活道路的工人阶级，劳动群众的团结一致的高尚例子不管在史册上，还是在活着的一代人的记忆中将永不消失。
    我们有权把苏中最高级会晤看成是一个重要的界限。一个很长的相互疏远的时期已经过去。我们将要共同缔造我们的未来。那么，过去的教训在哲学和政治上使我们学到了什么呢？
    我觉得，第一，懂得了破坏、恶化国与国之间的关系比建立、巩固和充实这种关系要简单得多。由于两三个不考虑伙伴利益的错误决定，企图把自己的观点强加给对方，把互相欺负推向政治的高度，使意识形态上的争论和分歧发展成国家对立，结果在两个曾经友好的国家之间就会筑起一道猜疑和不信任之墙。
    可见，珍惜国与国之间的良好关系，加强这个巨大的民族和国际财产，使之一代代传下去是何等的重要。
    我相信，不管是我们两国的领导，还是我们的公民都不希望再犯那些后来难以纠正的错误。最重要的是，希望苏联和中国的青年要吸取这个教训，因为两国关系的未来取决于他们。
    我觉得我们大家应该考虑一下，为了两国人民正常、友好关系代代相传能够干什么。这就是青年将要继续并顺利完成老战士们所倡导的社会主义社会更新。
    第二，懂得了必须对彼此在政治和行动上的不一致表现谅解。很自然，苏联和中国对各种问题和现象都有自己的立场和态度。不应把这点看成是合作的绊脚石。努力寻找互相可以接受的解决办法，同时相互尊重对方的观点和立场，这是唯一合理的态度。我们的两国恰恰如此走到今日的意义重大的会晤，我们两国各自走过了这个路程的自己的一段。
    同时我想，苏中关系并不是孤立存在的，这是错综复杂的国际关系的一个不可分割的部分。这个关系，只有自然地适合国际体系，符合它今天发生的积极变化，才能够成为两国间真正坚固和富有成效的关系。
    我们和中国领导同志的会谈从一开始就贯穿了这样一个思想，即苏中关系的改善不针对任何其他国家，既不要求中国，也不要求苏联“放弃”自己与第三国，——社会主义国家或资本主义国家，发达国家或发展中国家，西方国家或东方国家，——所形成的联系。
    除此以外，正常的苏中关系符合于全世界社会的利益，与当今世界发展的主要势头相称。
    现在我将说一说，我们如何看待发展关系的前景。
    相互谅解和信任的进一步加深，就使我们两国能够把精力集中在和平创作劳动、增多物质和精神资源，在持久和稳定的和平条件之下解决自己的问题。
    最近几年来，双方都采取了步骤以便在苏中边境地区降低军势对立的水平。据知，１９８５年之后，我们裁减了自己在远东地区的军队，单方面地承担了不增强陆基的和空基的核工具的义务。
    根据苏美协议将在苏联东部要销毁４３６枚中短程导弹。１９８９年到１９９０年部署在这地区的苏军集群将要裁减２０万人，其中在远东区的１２万人。我可以通告，陆军要裁减１２个师，空军要解散１１个团，太平洋舰队要削减１６只军舰。
    今年５月份，我们开始进行历次地裁减在蒙古的驻军：１９８９到１９９０年将撤出３个师的全体部队，其中包括两个坦克师，以及全部的空军集群。
    部署在苏中边境地区的苏军改编已开始了，使之完全符合于防御的合理足够水平的原则。我们准备进一步地努力，在与中国协商好的基础上从边境地区撤出除边防所留的一般兵力之外的军队和武器。
    使苏中边界非军事化，把它变成为和平友好的界线——这就是我们经共同努力可以达到的良好目标。
    互利合作的广阔天地正展现在人们活动的主要领域里——即经济领域。我们两国间的贸易额近几年来虽然有了一定的增加，但是，不仅贸易额，而且贸易增长速度远离现有的可能性。
    在一体化的过程中，在不断加强国际劳动分工和协作联系迅速扩大的背景下，还不到２０亿卢布的苏中贸易交流看起来是太少了。况且所谈的还是两个具有巨大潜力的国家。它们有世界上最漫长的边界，也就是说，有极为良好的合作条件。
    经济协作的潜力比现有的合作水平高得多。当然，即使双方都很希望利用这些可能性，但是他们也无法一下子就能实现。必须确定有前途的领域，解决复杂的定价的问题和帮助企业寻找合适伙伴。此外，还必须有时间培训人才，积累经验，因为在经济关系实际压缩的那些年内失掉了好多时间。
    虽然不提出不现实的任务，但是我们认为，我们能够保证在最近的将来苏中贸易将有实际的增长，这是符合两国利益的。尤其是在以下的传统领域加强关系，如原料和工业产品交换，促进兴建能源项目以及研制和使用先进技术的最为现代化的领域。
    至于说到合作的形式，那么，随着贸易的扩大，还可以努力争取在企业、设计局、科学研究所之间建立起直接联系，建立包括第三国参加的合营公司和生产单位。
    当我们准备对北京的访问之时，我国专家认为，苏中合作很有效的领域之一是铺设运输“液体煤炭”的管道。顺便说一句，这项事业是引起关注的发展现代动力的大有可为的领域之一。
    大有前途的是两国共同开发从中国到欧洲的新“丝绸之路”，由北京经乌鲁木齐、阿拉木图直至莫斯科的铁路干线。这条道路的重要的一段近年内即将竣工。
    苏联远东、西伯利亚各州各地与中国东北各省进行长期合作，哈萨克共和国、苏联中亚共和国与中国西北各省、各自治区将会在两国业务联系发展方面发挥重要的潜力。
    我们从越来越出现的全亚洲经济一体化进程的角度看待苏中经贸联系的扩大和加深。现在在我国关注并分析中国经济对外开放政策的经验，并考虑建立经济特区的问题，包括一系列与中国邻近的边境区。
    在这个大厅出席有很多有名的中国学者、文化界人士以及跟我们一起来的苏联科学界和文艺界知识分子的代表。我愿意现在，当苏联和中国好像再相互认识的时候，我们两国的使命——即促进人民之间了解，当前是十分重要的。
    苏联和中国学者的相互接触和共同研究都对双方带来很多好处。不久以前苏联科学院和中国科学院签订了关于合作主要方向的协定。我确信，科学家经协作努力，会增加他们对加速两国社会经济发展的贡献。
    在文化方面我们拥有一个精神往来的无价之宝的财富，这首先是文学艺术方面的交流的传统。
    在我国很有名望的中国作家鲁迅先生写到：我“觉得，在中国和俄国之间存在着某种的联系，他们的文化和历史有相当共同之处。”我们珍惜现代中国文艺家和翻译家的努力，他们把俄国和苏联文艺作品作为中国读者的财富。
    在苏联对中国独特的古老的文化兴趣特别大，在莫斯科的各种博物馆和列宁格勒爱米达日举办的中国文艺展览越来越经常。传统的中医也是很受欢迎的。在苏联出版的“中国文学丛书”，４０册受到了苏联读者的热烈欢迎。
    社会人士、文化、艺术、科学界人士的接触，人间广阔的往来，都使我们的关系更加充实，而且，同样重要的是，更加公开民主的关系。
    目前在经济、社会、社会政治改革交流经验方面也有互利合作的可能性。
    中国比苏联早点开始的经济改革，苏联很关心贵国改革。在一个具有好多世纪的自封和半殖民地落后状态的庞大国家里，着手深入改革社会机制来进行现代化的那种政党和人民的勇气是令人尊重的。
    你们在这条道路上取得的重大成就以及所碰到的困难，我们都熟悉。同志们，我们真诚的、友好的祝愿你们坚定不移地朝着自己的主要目标前进，把中华人民共和国变成为一个发达的现代化社会主义国家。
    一般地说来，不必只看按人口的平均产量和消费量、与世界先进国家的比例如何而就去判断一个国家的情况和能力。应该看这个国家朝着什么方向发展，为这种发展不断铺平道路，才是至关重要的。
    至于困难来说，在建立一个新的社会制度的那么复杂的大事中，这很自然。我们按自己的经验来看非常理解这一点。
    我们经济、科技潜力，其社会方面的成绩众所周知。但是，我们的发展速度和质量到了７０年代就开始下降。据分析表明，虽然受到消极影响，事情的本质所在不仅仅在于小的毛病和错误。
    主要祸根就在于我国２０年代末３０年代初形成了命令官僚主义体制的短处。只有拆除这个体制，完全使列宁思想和社会主义原则重新发挥效力，才可以使国家走出僵局，制止临头的危机。革命性改革的策划就这样产生了。
    我凭借着苏共中央１９８５年４月全会之后的四年以来所积累的知识和经验，而现在就讲这个了。但是，对这些实事的认识本身也没有一下子就认识好了。党和人民一步一步地，像登上楼梯一样，而走向自己的“认识真理的时刻”。
    我们曾经提出了任务，从巩固最起码的纪律，即巩固劳动、生产、财政纪律的任务开始。但是，很快就发现了，只要采取这些措施，就达不到很多目标。只有消除工作者脱节财产的现象，只有他们在自己的工厂和企业、在集体农场和国营农庄、在学院和科学研制局发扬主人翁精神，才可以把事业真正地推向前进。
    生活本身使人得出结论，要在全部的经济体制上进行彻底改革，使企业转到完全经济核算、自筹资金、自负盈亏，为合作部门的发展创造条件，必须广泛使用商品货币杠杆的作用。
    在改革经济管理体制上，起到特别作用的是中央部门和地方机关职能之间的合理比例的方面。我们制定了方针、要坚决地提高加盟共和国的经济自主权，扩大地方苏维埃的经济能力，同时加强他们为满足居民需求所负起的责任。理所当然，所指的并不是要削弱中央机构的协调和调整职能。没有这一点，任何的现代国家就无法顺利的发展。
    消除平均主义，贯彻执行按劳分配的社会主义原则这个问题也亟待解决。质量和生产率高的劳动，高内行程度的、职业技巧性强的工作应收到应有的报酬。与此同时，我们认为应该加强社会对苏联人的保护，给每个劳动者保证最起码的生活收入水平。
    在我们通过了关于转到新的经营制度的一系列法律文件不久以后，很清楚地就体会到了，经济体制改革如果得不到在政治体制的彻底改革措施的保障，那也就无法运行起来。
    如果劳动人民能够对管理的决议予以影响，并且参加各级领导的选举，如果我们能够把社会主义与民主有机地结合起来的话，那么，劳动者才可以真正地感觉到他们自己是国民财富的共同主人，这就是苏联共产党去年夏季举行的第１９届代表会议作出的一个最重要的结论。不到一年之后，我们进行了数十年来首次实行的民主选举。
    同志们，您们大概知道，过一个星期以后在莫斯科将要举行苏联全国人民代表大会，它将组成新任的最高苏维埃和政府，确定苏维埃国家对内对外政策的主要方向，事实上，使我们整个国家机制吸收新的活力。
    政治体制改革下一阶段要解决另外同等重要的任务是民族间关系的和谐化。普遍受人们支持的苏联联邦制发展的公式是权力大的中央和权力大的加盟共和国。
    在充分发挥我们政治制度的民主化的时候，我们的出发点是社会的全体成员为社会的健康发展、及其社会政治安定的责任应该提高。不保证这一点，改革的正常的过程是不可想象的。正因为如此，我们非常重视加强法制、社会秩序、创造为建立社会主义法制国家而所需要的其他各种条件。
    所有这些改革，如果说是平坦地舒舒服服进行的话，那我就违背事实真相了。
    让我们看一看这个过程的辩证法吧。正在形成下来的社会机制要保证考虑全体社会各个阶层的利益，就是工人阶级、农民、知识分子、加盟共和国和自治共和国以及各种少数民族的利益。但是，这些机制尚未全部形成，还没有发挥其充分的功能。与此同时，在有了公开性、多元制的情况下数十年以来曾经积累下来的悬而未决的问题却暴露出来了。人们的期望常常快于改革的速度。
    我们不把情况戏剧化，很了解劳动人民希望早日看到改革的合法愿望。我们全力以赴加速国家与社会生活各个方面的改革。但是也应该考虑到，社会发展进程，就像大自然发展进程一样，具有时间的自然延伸性。不管我们怎样愿意，需要三四年的最紧张做的工作，一年是做不完的。
    众所周知，催赶历史奔腾前进的企图要付出多大的代价。但是在政治、经济等方面也不可以放任自流。当机器调整好了，它就能自动正常地运转。然而，为了开动这个机器，必须下很大功夫。
    总之，需要有一个全面斟酌的改革战略。在这种情况下，党的作用具有特殊重要的意义。
    苏联共产党倡导了改革，敢于坚决地、毫不妥协地揭露过去形成的社会主义的变形现象。党制定了并向社会提出进行经济和政治体制根本改革的构思。现在党已经成了保证能顺利完成我国社会主义改革唯一的聚合力量。
    在对自己进行自身改革同时，党在列宁主义原则的基础上改善与国家的关系，更充分地发挥自己作为社会的政治先锋队的作用。
    在结束对我国情况介绍之前，我想强调指出，整个改革的构思是以忠于人民在１９１７年１０月所做的社会主义抉择为基础的。
    众所周知，西方对我们的改革，对中国和其他社会主义国家的类似改革都很感兴趣。他们正在辩论一个问题：这些进程在什么程度上发展了社会主义？在什么程度上背离社会主义？有人公开希望，推广经济核算关系和市场，公开性与民主将导致某种混合社会制度的产生，甚至导致资本主义的复辟。
    这样的估计立足于一个错误观点，似乎经济杠杆与民主绝对是资本主义的本质属性。其实，这不过是人类在自己的发展悠久的历史上制定的调整社会关系的方式，在不同社会制度的条件下都可以使用。当然，也应该考虑到各个社会制度的特点。
    我们确信，社会主义能够实现，并将一定实现经济与政治民主的有机结合，人的社会保证和人的自由。这就是我们更新社会的全部工作的目标。
    下面我想谈到另一个同改革相关的原则性问题。
    我们把这一进程看做是自己国家的，苏联的，一丝一毫地不愿意把它强加于任何他国。就是把一个模式，再说，并不是完美无缺的模式强加于他人，或者照搬模式，过去是世界社会主义发展的许多摩擦的原因。
    我们牢牢地掌握了这个教训。我们是在完全尊重独立和选择社会发展的方式与方法的自主权利的基础上，建立同一切其他社会主义国家的关系。
    我党发展同共产党和工人党的关系时，也是从上述原则出发的。我们和中国同志们商定，在这样完全平等的基础上发展苏联共产党与中国共产党的联系。
    目前，一系列社会主义国家有从内容上，而且有时从形式上同我们改革近似的进程。这再次证明，应更加积极地交流经验，互相学习，一方面，创造性地吸取世界社会主义实践中最好的东西，而另一方面，避免重犯错误。
    苏联的改革，中国的改革，许多其他社会主义国家的改造破除了关于社会主义是一种千篇一律的，一成不变的制度的错误概念，证明，社会主义有向前发展，自我完善的能力。
    二十世纪令人亲眼看到，人类关于美好的未来的理想是多么难以实现的。我们现在关于建立新式社会的概念与十九世纪当社会主义刚刚开始从空想转变为科学之时的概念不同，在我们面前显现得更为复杂的任务。
    但是，目前我们富有了实践的宝贵无价的经验。在放弃幻想，在摆脱教条和变形同时，今日的，即本世纪末的社会主义经历着全面更新的过程。借用人类文明在经济、文化、科学、技术、政治和法律方面取得的所有成果来丰富性质先进的社会制度——这就是又光明正大又令人鼓舞的目标！
    尊敬的同志们！
    社会主义的更新过程是在全世界规模的，具有历史意义的变革的背景下进行的。自古以来认为是永生不死的人类首次碰到了生存问题。
    生存权利本身具有了新的涵义，成为了亟需全球解决的问题。在本国境内躲避不开核战的台风。在本国境内也不能确保空气纯洁，不能防止艾滋病的传染，也不会使自身免遭恐怖主义的危害。
    从这种很明显确定的事实很自然地可以得出一个总的公式，即：在当今相互依赖的世界上狭隘民族孤立的发展再也行不通了。人类的生存和由其创造的文明的进步，只能是各国人民共同创造的成果。
    但问题是：如何把现代社会发展的另一个重要倾向——确立各国人民的民族自觉，以及自由选择本国道路的绝对权利的倾向与此相结合呢？
    世界正在一体化，用形象的话说，正在“缩小”，同时，也越来越变得更多样化，好像正在“扩大”。我们时代的一个现实的矛盾之一就在于此。这个矛盾无法忽视。试图用武力消除这个矛盾而把这种或那种社会制度强加给各国人民，或向他们指定由大国某种集会制定的行动做法是极为危险的。不，当今时代的死结子一刀切不行，应当把它谨慎地解开。
    在当前的多样化的世界上只有唯一办法解决现实矛盾，这就是靠利益均衡，在平等伙伴合作的基础上加以解决。看来，政治家和外交家历来都还没有解决这样错综复杂的任务了。因为所谈的是１５０多个国家的利益，再说，根据历史的“全球钟表”处在不同的发展阶段的那些国家的利益。
    但是，据我们所想那样，没有别的道路可走。只有真正独立国家的一致才可以争取当今世界所需的确实稳定的相互依赖体系。
    我觉得，这点在庞大的亚太地区特别突出，各种社会制度和时代的“汇合”的地方就在这里，古老的文明与向２１世纪的技术突破口所邻近的地方也在这里。
    在亚洲有不少随时都可以煽起火来的军事紧张局势的策源地。与此同时，周恩来与尼赫鲁曾经制定“潘查希拉”——即和平共处五项原则的地方恰恰在这里。印度传统的无暴力概念和古老中国的“仁”哲学概念的相结合是与当今世界的寻求和忧虑相适应。
    如果说，这种的地球多数人口所住的、和不同力量所交叉的大陆由于地理和历史本身而就扮演着某种的“熔炉”角色，那么，这些话大概不会太夸张了。该“熔炉”的进程在很大程度就预定全球人类的命运。
    是不是可以从不同的制度、意识形态、文明一定不会相合、一定要相互斗争的角度而去看待这些进程吗？我想，这样的态度是致命的态度。
    我们确信，为找到多种利益与立场的共同之处存在着现实可能性和必要性。为此，首先必须克服霸权主义和施加压力的任何尝试，排斥干涉内政的任何行动。
    某一个国家能否做为亚洲太平洋和印度洋地区的战略、社会经济、政治安全的“保证国”？显然，不能。只有这些地区所有国家进行集体努力，才可以保证真正的安全和稳定。
    我在符拉迪沃斯托克和克拉斯诺亚尔斯克的发言中号召了大家齐心协力，寻找对亚太地区国家之间关系进行改革的途径，以免把该地区变成危险的军事对抗的战场，从而邀请了大家共同思考，如何解决地区冲突，停止核武器扩散，限制海军活动，裁减武装部队，制定信任措施。
    解决共同任务在很大程度上取决于国家双边关系，这点是不必说了。从这个角度来讲，我们十分重视苏联同亚太地区所有国家发展友好关系。
    苏中关系正常化毫无疑问是最近最重大的事件。
    最近几年来，我们继续加强与印度的传统合作，我和拉·甘地总理签署的苏印关于无核、无暴力的和平的宣言引起了国际政治界，社会各界人士的广泛反应。
    我们继续加深与过去已建立良好关系的地处这个地区的其他国家的互相谅解。同过去只有形式的、外交接触的那些国家，我们着手进行更加积极的对话。我们朝着过去互相谅解短缺的那些国家迈出了步骤。
    这首先涉及到对日关系。我们十分尊重这个国家，想同它建立全面的关系。当然，这方面还存在其他一些问题。苏日合作可以给两国带来许多东西，并成为亚洲和平与发展的重要积极因素。最近，为此积累了一些条件，但要实现这些条件，双方还需要做不少工作。
    众所周知，苏美关系中发生了什么样的变化。无须证明，这符合整个国际社会的利益，为促进亚洲和太平洋地区问题的解决也开辟了进一步的可能性。我同美国总统布什商定本着具有连续性的精神行事，巩固已经取得的建设性成果。不久前在莫斯科的会谈重申了双方的这种意愿。我们主张：由对抗转向合作的积极趋势能够为自己开辟道路，逐步稳定下来并占主导地位。
    在我国对亚洲的政策中，占很大地位的是协助消除在亚洲存在的冲突和紧张局势的温床。
    苏联从阿富汗撤出了军队以来已经３个月了。但是这个国家的事态发展越来越趋于令人不安的状况。
    我们认为，国际社会要对这个威胁到周围的一切地区的火灾性的冲突采取更为积极的立场的时候已到了。对阿富汗现有的当局当然能采取不同的态度，但是，令人很清楚的是，阿富汗国内相对抗的各方之间谁胜谁输的问题要留给他们自己去解决。阿富汗将应该是什么样的国家，只有阿富汗人民才有权决定。
    十年之久的围绕柬埔寨的情况一直是亚洲大陆上的痛点之一，现在“隧道里才有了光亮”是令人可喜的事。
    当然，冒讲事情无理由。要解决柬埔寨问题还需作出政治和外交方面的很大的努力。但是，今年９月份越南撤完军队将使这里有了质的新情况，将给最终解决这个早需解决的冲突创造实际条件。
    我们同柬埔寨和越南同志们曾讨论过这些问题，昨天同贵国的领导同志们也讨论过一次。在形成着印象，柬埔寨问题的解决逐渐实际地形成起来，它可能的阶段已开始显得更为明确。
    对于可以而且也应该作为这一问题解决基础的最重要的原则来讲，这还是唯一公正的民族自决权的原则。只有柬埔寨人自己才能找到该国的将来和解和政治制度的公式。
    对于苏联来讲，它准备参加有关国际保障措施，并尊重柬埔寨人民的任何抉择，它争取独立、中立和不结盟的方针。
    我想重申我们对朝鲜人民民主主义共和国为和平民主统一朝鲜而作出的努力的坚定不移的支持。显然，要达到这个目标，就需要消除该半岛上的紧张局势，并撤出美国军队，其在这里的存在早就是毫无道理。
    亚太地区还没有业已形成的谈判结构，也没有经常多边磋商的机制。所以发生问题，为所有感兴趣的国家在联合国的支持和协助下，经共同努力推动可叫它为全亚过程的那种事情，时间是否已到了吗？
    这个思想还没有得到普遍的积极响应。有的国家认为，实现这个思想的时候还没有到，必须准备良好条件，首先应该根除这里潜在的冲突策源地。但我们想，就是经过共同努力完成这个对亚洲和全世界非常重要的任务容易多了。
    顺便地讲，解决柬埔寨问题的前景不是说明这个问题！正是在很大程度上因为几乎所有亚太地区国家，并且不仅是这些国家，尽力参加解决，才有解决的可能性。
    这也很自然。亚洲并不与其他大陆隔绝，其联系包括日益广泛的范围——从经济交换到文化相互渗透。
    由于苏联的地理位置，我们同欧亚接触有特别大的关系。连接两个大陆文化的“桥梁”，可以说，既横穿我国的辽阔土地，又横穿我国的精神生活。
    目前东边的太平洋不是把亚洲与美洲像障碍物一样分开，而是相反，起中间环节的作用。因此，亚洲的安全是普遍，地球性安全的组成部分。
    与和平问题同时，发展问题在亚非比任何地方尖锐。饥饿、贫穷、文盲、流行性传染病的广阔地区集中在这两个大陆上。众所周知，千百万人悲剧的根源在于殖民主义与新殖民主义，也在于发达国家与发展中国家之间的极大鸿沟。尽管从前进行了很多努力，这一鸿沟在勒死债务国的巨额外债的“绞索”的影响下继续扩大。
    应该强调的是，不仅在人均国民收入，换句话说，富裕与贫穷关系方面有着鸿沟。更令人担忧的技术水平相差悬殊，实质上向落后国家剥夺赶上先进国家的机会，从而似乎永远保存兴旺国家与贫困国家之分。
    我们认为，必须使全部世界舆论，每一个人都理解，这种状况不能没完没了存在下去。从实质来讲，它等于核子或生态威胁，能引起爆炸。
    对这一最尖锐问题的态度可以如何？我们认为，要从开始拒绝极端办法。对于再分配财富，确立某种国际平均主义抱有希望是不现实的。富裕国家关于躲在堡垒里或用小恩小惠把贫穷国家打发走的打算同样也是毫无根据的。一旦要发生灾难，必定涉及到全体人类。
    唯一公正合理的解决是要在加强共同的协助发展的道路上去寻求。为了解决引人注目的社会上的问题，自愿的国际性的共同努力是可能的和必要的。是在尊重独立和民族自决权的基础上的。
    我们完全支持不结盟国家运动为此所提出的意见综合。最近许多政治潮流在这一方向也提出了有益的倡议。
    当然，对我们忠实于人民国际主义团结的共产党员来讲，参加这个光明正大事业是信念和义务的问题。
    依我们看，在主动发展的倡议中，值得注意的倡议是设立一个基于很简单的原则上的世界先进技术存库。这就是所有国家、公司、组织和个别人，都可以对此存库自愿地缴纳存款。同时它们都有可能免费或以很小的代价采用这个知识和经验宝库，为了发展目的。
    这个建议并不是什么完全新的东西。世界上已经有许多从同样原则进行工作的各种基金。这里所说的是把这个事业转为全地球性的。
    看起来好像，这个建议相适应于新的国际政治制度。我们同中国领导人就此问题进行了内容丰富的会谈。
    尊敬的同志们！
    在思考现代世界面临的复杂问题时，可以作出结论：文明的进步和其向新高峰的突破从来未有过这样大的可能性。与此同时，人类的倒退和甚至于本身的存在的威胁也是从来未有过那么严重的。
    在这种情况之下，所有国家和政府、政党和社会运动必须对自己的决议和行动持着极大的责任。我们应当为了当代和后一代人的利益利用具有历史性的机会。
    我表示希望和相信，在这个争取未来的斗争中，苏联和中华人民共和国将会积极的合作。我们两国对世界共同体应解决的问题，作出适当的贡献。
    我们祝友好的中国人民繁荣富强，祝每个家庭享受幸福，万事如意。
