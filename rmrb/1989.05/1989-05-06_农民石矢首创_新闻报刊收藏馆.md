Farmer Shi Shi Pioneers the Establishment of a Newspaper and Periodical Collection Hall

A farmer from Timeshi Township, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, Shi Shi, recently established the first private newspaper and periodical collection hall in the country.

The 37-year-old Shi Shi has an elementary school education. In recent years, he has devoted himself to the collection and research of newspapers and periodicals. By the end of last year, he had collected over 8,500 types of newspapers and periodicals from across the country, in addition to a batch of news-related books and materials. In November 1986, the News Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department sent a letter to encourage Shi Shi's efforts in collecting newspapers.
