Late April, the foreign ministers of Iran and Iraq, through the mediation of United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, resumed negotiations on the implementation of Security Council Resolution 598. This is the latest round of talks since the three rounds of post-war negotiations between the two countries stalled last year. Due to significant disagreements on several key issues, this round of talks has not yet made any breakthroughs. Pérez de Cuéllar urged both sides to reach a compromise, and both Iran and Iraq expressed their willingness to continue the negotiations.

On July 20, 1987, the United Nations Security Council, in response to the seven-year-long Iran-Iraq War, adopted the binding Resolution 598. Since then, the war situation and the Gulf situation have undergone dramatic changes. Iraq successively recaptured lost territories and then launched a full-scale offensive, pushing the battlefield deep into Iranian territory by several dozen kilometers, breaking the long-standing stalemate on the Iran-Iraq front. Meanwhile, the U.S. and the Soviet Union implemented escort plans in the Gulf, and warships from other Western countries also entered the Gulf, leading to unprecedented tensions between the U.S. and Iran. On August 20 of last year, Iran and Iraq almost simultaneously announced a ceasefire along the entire front. Subsequently, at the urging and mediation of Pérez de Cuéllar, the two countries held three rounds of foreign minister-level talks to explore ways to implement Resolution 598.

The developments in the final stages of the Iran-Iraq War directly influenced the post-war negotiation positions of Iran and Iraq. In the past few rounds of talks, the main issues of contention between the two sides have been:

**Withdrawal of Troops and Border Issues** After the adoption of Resolution 598, Iran demanded an investigation into the responsibility for the war, clarifying that Iraq was the aggressor, before implementing other provisions of the resolution. Iraq, on the other hand, demanded an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire and withdrawal of troops, and the sequential implementation of all provisions of Resolution 598. Given the actual outcome after the ceasefire, Iran demanded that Iraq withdraw its troops first and accused Iraq of occupying over 2,000 square kilometers of Iranian territory. Iraq proposed that the Iran-Iraq border be redrawn and emphasized that it had already fully withdrawn its troops.

**Dispute over Sovereignty of the Shatt al-Arab** The 105-kilometer stretch of the Shatt al-Arab downstream was originally the southern border between Iran and Iraq. According to the 1975 Algiers Agreement signed by Iran and Iraq, the southern border between the two countries was demarcated along the main navigation channel of the Shatt al-Arab. Iraq pointed out that Saddam Hussein had announced the abrogation of the Algiers Agreement simultaneously with the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq War. Therefore, the border in the Shatt al-Arab section should be on the Iranian side, and Iraq would regain full sovereignty over the Shatt al-Arab, but Iranian ships would also enjoy the right to navigate freely on the river. Iran emphasized that the Algiers Agreement remains valid and that Iraq has no right to unilaterally tear up the agreement. In the negotiations, Iraq also proposed that since Iran had already used its ports in the Gulf for imports and exports, sharing the benefits of the ceasefire, but Iraq's only waterway to the Gulf, the Shatt al-Arab, was blocked by sunken ships and could not be used, it demanded the dredging of the river. Iran considered that dredging the river was not included in Resolution 598 and accused Iraq of raising irrelevant issues.

**Determining War Responsibility** How to determine the responsibility for the Iran-Iraq War and which international authority should investigate and arbitrate this matter is one of the most contentious issues in the Iran-Iraq talks. Iran believes that the Iraq Air Force's attack on Iran on September 22, 1980, sparked the war. Iraq, however, believes that Iran's shelling of Iraqi border towns on September 4 of the same year marked the beginning of the war. Both sides expressed their willingness to accept international investigation and arbitration, but they have differing views on the choice of the international arbitration body. Iraq advocates for the existing International Court of Justice to undertake this task. Iran, however, demands the establishment of a high-level, authoritative body to oversee this work.

**Exchange of Prisoners of War** Iraq proposed that more than 20,000 Iraqi prisoners of war in Iran have not been registered. Iran denied this and emphasized that the precondition for the exchange of prisoners of war is Iraq's withdrawal of troops first.

The success or failure of the Iran-Iraq peace talks will directly affect the future relations between the two countries and the smooth implementation of their post-war reconstruction plans. Currently, the people of Iran and Iraq, as well as the Gulf countries, are eager to ensure peace and stability in the Gulf region to jointly strengthen cooperation and economic development. It is encouraging that both Iran and Iraq have repeatedly expressed their desire for peace and agreed to establish a joint military committee to verify the withdrawal of troops. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the momentum of Middle East peace talks, and the persistent mediation efforts of the international community and the Gulf Cooperation Council have also had a positive impact on the Iran-Iraq peace talks and the easing of the Gulf situation. However, the religious conflicts, ethnic disputes, and border disputes between Iran and Iraq have been long-standing and cannot be easily resolved in short-term talks. People hope that the two Muslim brother countries, which have endured the ravages of war, will, after reflecting on their experiences, recognize that peace talks are the necessary path to resolving disputes and will strive to eliminate differences and gradually normalize relations between the two countries.

### 两伊和谈的分歧及前景

　　两伊和谈的分歧及前景
    朱梦魁
    ４月下旬，伊朗和伊拉克两国的外长通过联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔的中介，重新就实施安理会５９８号决议举行谈判。这是自去年两伊之间的３轮战后谈判陷于僵局后所进行的又一轮谈判。由于两伊在一些主要问题上存在严重分歧，这次谈判仍未取得突破性进展。德奎利亚尔呼吁两伊达成妥协，两伊也表示将继续进行谈判。
    １９８７年７月２０日，联合国安理会针对持续７年之久的两伊战争，通过了带强制性的５９８号决议。此后，两伊战局和海湾局势发生急剧变化。伊拉克接连收复失地，进而全线出击将战场推进到伊朗境内纵深几十公里，打破了两伊战场长期僵持的局面。与此同时，美苏在海湾执行护航计划，其他一些西方国家的舰只也驶进海湾，美伊关系空前紧张。去年８月２０日，两伊几乎同时宣布实行全线停火。随后，经过德奎利亚尔的敦促和斡旋，两伊举行了３轮外长级谈判，探求执行５９８号决议的办法。
    两伊战争最后阶段的发展，直接影响到两伊战后的谈判立场。在过去的几轮谈判中，两伊争执不下的主要问题有：
    撤军与边界问题　５９８号决议通过后，伊朗要求首先调查战争责任，明确伊拉克是侵略者，然后再实施决议中的其他各项。伊拉克则要求立即全面停火撤军，并按顺序全面执行５９８号决议。鉴于两伊实际停火后的结局，伊朗要求伊拉克首先撤军，并指控伊拉克侵占了２０００多平方公里的伊朗领土。伊拉克提出，两伊边界必须重新划分，并强调已经全部撤军。
    阿拉伯河的主权归属争议　阿拉伯河下游的１０５公里原是两伊南部边界。根据１９７５年两伊在阿尔及尔签订的协议，两伊南部边界以阿拉伯河主航道中心线划分。伊拉克指出，萨达姆总统在两伊战争爆发的同时已宣布废除阿尔及尔协议，因此阿拉伯河地段的边界应在伊朗一侧，伊拉克将全部收回阿拉伯河主权，但伊朗船只也可享有在该河自由航行的权利。伊朗强调阿尔及尔协议依然有效，伊拉克无权单方面撕毁协议。伊拉克在谈判中又提出，由于伊朗已经利用其在海湾的港口进出口物资，分享了停火带来的好处，但伊拉克唯一能进入海湾的水上出口通道阿拉伯河因沉船堵塞而未能利用，要求疏浚河道。伊朗认为，疏浚河道不包括在５９８号决议之内，指责伊拉克节外生枝。
    关于确定战争责任　如何确定两伊战争的责任和由哪一个国际权威机构就此进行调查与仲裁，是两伊谈判中争议最烈的难点之一。伊朗认为，１９８０年９月２２日伊拉克空军袭击伊朗挑起了战争。伊拉克则认为，同年９月４日伊朗炮击伊拉克边境城镇是战争的开端。双方都表示愿意接受国际社会的调查和仲裁，但对于国际仲裁机构的选择存在分歧。伊拉克主张由现有的国际法院来承担这一任务。伊朗则要求建立一个高级的权威性机构来主持这项工作。
    关于交换战俘问题　伊拉克提出，有２万多名在伊朗的伊拉克战俘没有注册登记。伊朗对此表示否认，并强调交换战俘的前提是伊拉克首先撤军。
    两伊和谈的成败，直接关系到今后两伊的关系和两国战后重建计划的顺利进行。当前两伊人民和海湾国家渴望确保海湾地区的和平稳定，以共同致力加强合作与发展经济。可喜的是，两伊双方曾多次表达和平的愿望，并同意建立联合军事委员会，核查撤军事宜。另一方面，苏联从阿富汗撤军，中东和谈势头的发展，以及国际社会与海湾合作委员会坚持不懈的调解，也对两伊和谈和海湾局势的缓和产生积极影响。但两伊间的宗教矛盾、民族纠纷和边境争端由来已久，难以在短期的谈判中泯灭恩仇。人们希望，两个历尽战争劫波的穆斯林兄弟国家在痛定思痛之后，能够认识到和平谈判是解决争端的必由之路，从而努力消除分歧，逐步实现两国关系的正常化。
