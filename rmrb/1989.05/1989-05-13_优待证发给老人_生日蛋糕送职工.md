The "High-Age Retired Workers Special Privileges Card" was issued on April 24. It is estimated that 50,000 people in the city will receive the "Special Privileges Card," enjoying the following privileges: free entry into urban parks, half-price tickets for theaters and cultural sites, purchasing the lowest-priced tickets for buses and trams, priority registration and medical treatment at healthcare facilities, priority purchasing of goods, bathing, haircuts, photography, grain, and cigarettes.

On the morning of May 4, Beijing Railway Station Post Office employees Hou Yi and Cheng Jie each received a birthday cake sent by their leaders. Since March 1, 25 employees of the bureau have received birthday cakes, and 4 employees have received birthday greetings telegrams sent by their leaders. This is a new measure taken by the bureau's leaders, full of human touch.

　　优待证发给老人  生日蛋糕送职工
    ●目前在沈阳市，胸前佩有“优待证”的老年人在公共场所处处受特殊照顾。该市“高龄退休职工优待证”于４月２４日诞生。预计全市获得“优待证”的有５万人，可以享受以下几方面的优待：在市内免费入公园，在影剧院和文物点可买半价票，乘电汽车按最低票价购票，在医疗单位看病优先挂号、就诊，优先购买商品、洗澡、理发、照像、买粮、买烟。　　　　　　　　　　　（仲迅）
    ●５月４日上午，北京站邮局职工侯义、程洁分别收到了该局领导送来的生日大蛋糕。从３月１日以来，该局已有２５位职工吃到了生日蛋糕，有４位职工收到了领导拍去的生日礼仪电报。这是该局领导新近采取的一项充满人情味的措施。
