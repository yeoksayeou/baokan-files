The city of Xingtai in Hebei Province is also known as the "Bull City." In this "Bull City," I met a diligent and humble "old yellow cow" – farmer entrepreneur Liu Yuhua.

Over fifty years old, how did Liu Yuhua transform from an ordinary farmer into a farmer entrepreneur? What methods did he use to manage the Xingtai Lihua Industrial Company, which owns more than a dozen commercial enterprises, in an orderly manner?

Everyone knows that "Manager Liu often sleeps only two or three hours a night, always immersed in books such as 'Political Economy,' 'History of Social Development,' 'Calculus,' 'Agricultural Technology,' and 'Biology.'" However, few people know that he has read two cubic meters of domestic and foreign materials related to the printing industry in just half a year. In 1985, the idea of establishing a modern color printing factory matured in Liu Yuhua's mind.

"Manager Liu doesn't smoke, doesn't drink, and is simply addicted to books." Several young deputy managers of the printing factory spoke of their manager with admiration. Liu Yuhua regards reading books and newspapers as his "first need," and it is from absorbing knowledge and obtaining information that he began his virtuous cycle in business. It was from the newspapers that he decided to open a plastic factory; it was from obtaining information about the "Beijing Ice Cream" refrigeration technology that he decided to open the Dongfeng Refrigeration Factory; and it was from books that he understood the necessity of establishing a modern printing factory, leading to the birth of the Xingtai Color Printing Factory.

Laser phototypesetting and offset printing equipment are ahead of their time for the Xingtai Lihua Industrial Company's subsidiary, the color printing factory. Since 1987, when the factory officially began printing tasks, Liu Yuhua invited computer experts from Peking University and technicians from the Changchun New Hua Printing Factory to strengthen the technical training of the workers.

Liu Yuhua is well aware that having advanced equipment is not enough; there must also be people with the corresponding skills to manage it. To strengthen commodity awareness and management, Liu Yuhua established a buying and selling relationship between different workstations, using economic measures to strictly control quality. Recently, he further introduced a cost management method, which expresses the company's production and sales costs in monetary terms, enabling effective and scientific management.

Understanding his entrepreneurial journey, I finally understood why he never stops reading – knowledge is too important to him.

　　读书的“牛”
    ——记邢台市农民企业家刘玉合
    袁践
    河北省邢台市又被称作“牛城”。在“牛城”里我见到了一位勤勤恳恳、朴朴素素的“老黄牛”——农民企业家刘玉合。
    年过半百的刘玉合凭什么从一个普通农民，发展成为一个农民企业家？用什么把拥有十几个工商企业的邢台丽华实业公司管理得井井有条？
    人们都了解“刘经理经常晚上只睡两三个小时的觉，总是泡在《政治经济学》、《社会发展史》、《微积分》、《农业技术》、《生物学》等书籍”，却还不知他半年内翻阅了以两立方米计的国内外有关印刷业的书籍资料。１９８５年，一个建立现代化彩色印刷厂的设想在刘玉合心中酝酿成熟。
    “刘经理不抽烟，不喝酒，唯有嗜书如命。”印刷厂几位年轻的副厂长提起他们的刘经理，不禁流露出钦佩之情。刘玉合把读书看报作为“第一需要”，而且也是从吸取知识、掌握信息开始了他的事业上的良性循环。正是从报纸上得到信息，他才决定开办塑料厂；也是他得到“北冰洋”制冷技术的信息，才决定开办了东风制冷厂；更是从书本中了解到建立现代化印刷厂的必要性，邢台彩印厂才应运而生。
    激光照排胶印设备，对邢台市丽华实业公司下属的彩印厂来说是超前的。自１９８７年正式接印刷任务以来，刘玉合从北大请来计算机专家，又从长春新华印刷厂聘请技工来加强职工的技术培训。
    刘玉合深知，有了先进的设备，还要有相应水平的人去管理。为强化商品意识，加强管理，刘玉合在各个工段之间确立买卖关系，用经济手段严把质量关，近日又进一步推出成本管理办法，即以货币形式表现企业生产和销售产品的全部费用，进行有效的科学管理。
    了解他创业的过程，我才理解他读书不辍，在于知识对他太重要了。
