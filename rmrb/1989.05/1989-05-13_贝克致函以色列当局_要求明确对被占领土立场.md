Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 11th.

According to reports from Jerusalem, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker recently wrote a letter to the Israeli authorities, requesting further clarification on several issues related to elections in the occupied territories.

The issues include: allowing Palestinians from East Jerusalem to participate in the elections; international supervision; the relationship between negotiations for a temporary solution in the occupied territories and negotiations for a final solution.

Baker also reiterated that the United States is committed to its peace vision for the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

On the 9th, Israeli Foreign Minister Arens responded by saying that after the Israeli cabinet's discussion, a more detailed draft of the election plan would be submitted to the United States.

However, an Israeli official stated that due to existing disagreements, it is impossible for the Israeli authorities to reach a complete consensus on the election issue.

　　贝克致函以色列当局
  　要求明确对被占领土立场
    新华社开罗５月１１日电  据来自耶路撒冷的消息，美国国务卿詹姆斯·贝克最近在一封信中要求以色列当局对有关被占领土选举的一些问题进一步表明立场。
    据报道，这些问题包括：让来自东耶路撒冷的巴勒斯坦人参加选举；国际监督；被占领土的临时解决办法谈判和最终解决办法谈判之间的关系。
    贝克还重申，美国对以色列占领的约旦河西岸和加沙地带的和平构想承担义务。
    以色列外长阿伦斯９日作出反应说，以色列内阁经过讨论后，将把一份更详细的选举计划草案交给美国。
    但是，以色列官方人士说，由于存在分歧，以色列当局内部不可能就选举问题达成完全一致意见。
