	Market inspections have revealed that counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment is rampant in major cities across China. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision has urged local authorities to crack down on these issues.

	According to market inspection reports, counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment is currently flooding the market. A responsible official from the State Bureau of Technical Supervision has warned consumers to be cautious when purchasing such items to avoid losses.

	The State Bureau of Technical Supervision, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics jointly conducted inspections of low-voltage electrical equipment in major cities across the country starting from the second half of last year. According to reports from 18 provinces and municipalities, out of 1,825 inspected units, a total of 1.758 million counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment items were found, valued at over 30 million yuan.

	The inspections revealed that many substandard low-voltage electrical equipment items were produced by cutting corners and using inferior materials. For example, silver contacts in AC contactors were replaced with copper, and the blades in knife switches were made of copper-plated iron instead of brass. Some vendors even collected discarded low-voltage electrical equipment, repainted them, and resold them. Many of these substandard products were made by factories without production licenses, and some had no factory name or address, while others imitated the trademarks of well-known brands.

	The investigation showed that the most complaints were about low-voltage electrical equipment produced in the Wenzhou region of Zhejiang Province. Many places reported that Wenzhou's products had caused irreparable economic losses.

	According to the analysis, the main reasons for the current market situation are as follows: First, some local leaders, out of consideration for local interests, do not seriously address the issue of substandard product manufacturers, fearing that it might affect "economic benefits." Second, some producers of counterfeit and substandard low-voltage electrical equipment use high rebates to push their products, allowing them to flood the market.

	An official from the State Bureau of Technical Supervision said that China's low-voltage electrical equipment production has adopted a production permit system. Products from factories with production permits are relatively reliable. He hopes that local authorities and relevant departments will work closely together to severely crack down on the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard products, protecting consumers' interests.

### 大中城市市场检查表明  假冒劣质低压电器泛滥成灾  国家技术监督局呼吁各地严厉打击

　　大中城市市场检查表明    
    假冒劣质低压电器泛滥成灾    
    国家技术监督局呼吁各地严厉打击
    新华社北京５月１０日电（记者姜在忠）据市场检查情况，目前我国市场上假冒劣质低压电器泛滥成灾。国家技术监督局有关负责人为此提醒用户要谨慎选购，以免造成损失。
    国家技术监督局、国家工商行政管理局、机械电子工业部从去年下半年开始，对全国主要大、中城市市场上的低压电器联合进行了检查。据目前收到的１８个省市的上报材料，抽查的１８２５个单位中，共查出假冒劣质低压电器１７５．８万台（件），价值３０００多万元。
    检查中发现，很多的劣质低压电器是由于偷工减料、以次充好造成的。如交流接触器的银触头竟用铜代替，闸刀开关的触刀用镀铜的铁板代替紫铜板等。还有一些经营者将到处收购来的废弃低压电器刷上一层新漆后上市兜售。这些劣质低压电器生产厂家，大都没有生产许可证，有的低压电器既无厂名又无厂址，有的则仿冒名牌厂家的商标。
    调查情况表明，各地对浙江温州地区生产的低压电器反映最为强烈，很多地方称温州地区生产的低压电器给他们造成了无法挽回的经济损失。
    据分析，造成目前市场上假冒劣质低压电器泛滥的原因大致有二：一是一些领导出于地方利益的考虑，不认真治理劣质产品生产厂家，生怕因此影响“经济效益”。二是一些假冒劣质低压电器生产者用高回扣的手段推销产品，使其得以在市场上倾销。
    国家技术监督局的负责人说，我国的低压电器生产已采取了生产许可证制度，获得生产许可证的厂家，其产品是比较可靠的。他希望各地、各有关部门密切配合，严厉打击那些假冒、劣质产品生产、销售者，维护消费者利益。
