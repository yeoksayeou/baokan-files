Rural single men of marriageable age face difficulties in finding spouses. Experts believe the main solution is to alleviate poverty.

	The People's Daily reports: Experts recently called for attention to the issue of rural single men of marriageable age facing difficulties in finding spouses, which is more pronounced than the problem faced by high-education single women of marriageable age. The associated social issues should be of concern to the entire society.

	The 1% sample data from the 1982 national census showed that there were 8,834,000 unmarried men aged 28-49 in rural areas, accounting for 78.4% of the total unmarried population in the same age group nationwide. In 1987, using the same census method, the number of unmarried rural men aged 28-49 was 7,447,000, accounting for 65.5% of the total unmarried population in the same age group nationwide.

	There are four main reasons for the difficulty rural single men of marriageable age face in finding spouses. First, poverty and the economic dependence of women lead many rural women to move to urban areas through marriage. Rural women often marry out more than they marry in. Second, the "family background" stigma still affects rural men, while women with the same background do not face the same marriage difficulties. Third, although rural women generally have lower educational levels than men, they often prefer to marry men with higher educational levels. Fourth, in some more isolated areas, free choice in marriage is still considered immoral, and there are few social venues for men and women to interact, leading to arranged marriages. The core of matchmaking is the evaluation of family wealth. The poorer the family, the more likely the man will remain single.

	The surplus of rural single men of marriageable age brings about several social problems. First, incidents of exchanging brides, swapping brides, and human trafficking are on the rise. Second, the surplus of men leads to less selective choices in marriage, sometimes resulting in men marrying women with mental disabilities, leading to a second generation of inferior offspring. Third, the closed and monotonous rural life causes long-term single men to experience psychological changes, becoming either numb and dull, lazy and depressed, or reckless, leading to increased incidents of theft, assault, and robbery, exacerbating the severe situation of social order.

	Undoubtedly, the root solution to the difficulty rural single men of marriageable age face in finding spouses lies in alleviating poverty. Additionally, cross-county marriage introduction agencies should be established, and the Marriage Law and family planning policies should be seriously promoted and implemented, ensuring a balanced male-to-female ratio, and conducting long-term population regulation.

### 农村大龄未婚男性结婚难  专家认为主要出路是治穷

　　农村大龄未婚男性结婚难
    专家认为主要出路是治穷
    本报讯  有关专家日前呼吁，农村大龄未婚男性比高学历的大龄女性结婚难的问题更为突出，由此引发的一系列社会问题应当引起全社会关注。
    １９８２年的全国人口普查１％抽样资料统计表明，农村２８—４９岁的未婚男性有８８３．４万人，占全国同龄范围未婚人口的７８．４％；１９８７年，同样的普查方式得出的数字说明，仍有７４４．７万２８—４９岁的农村大龄男性未婚，占全国同龄范围未婚总人口的６５．５％。
    造成农村大龄男性结婚难的原因有四个方面：其一，生活贫困和女子经济不能独立，使大量农村女子以婚姻为媒介流向城镇。农村女青年嫁出多，嫁入少。其二，“家庭出身论”的枷锁仍然套在农村男性的头上，而同样的出身，女子则免遭嫁人难的厄运。其三，农村女性自身文化水平虽然普遍低于男性，但在择偶时，她们多愿找文化程度高的男性。其四，自由恋爱在一些较为闭塞的地区仍被视为不道德的行为，乡村又缺乏交际场所，男女只能包办成婚。而媒妁之言的核心是看家境的穷富。家愈穷，愈易成光棍。
    农村大龄未婚男子“过剩”状态带来了许多社会问题。主要有：第一，转亲、换亲以及拐卖人口的事件愈演愈烈。第二，男多女少，使男子择偶不加选择，甚至娶痴呆疯傻女性为妻，从而导致第二代劣生。第三，封闭、单调的农村生活使长期单身生活的男性心理发生变异，或麻木迟钝，或懒散忧郁，或破罐破摔，奸偷打抢时有所闻，加剧了社会治安的严峻形势。
    无疑，根治“穷”症是解决农村大龄男性成婚难的出路所在。同时也应成立跨县区的婚姻介绍所，认真宣传贯彻《婚姻法》和计划生育政策，注意确保男女比例平衡等方法，持久地进行人口调节。
