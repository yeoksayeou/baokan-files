The lacquer wall painting "Today's Grand Canal," the longest of its kind in China, is currently on display at the China Art Museum in Beijing. This 150-meter-long painting is composed of 63 independent lacquer panels, depicting the fusion of ancient and modern civilizations along the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. Each panel stands alone as an individual piece, showcasing the unique features of the canal's banks; together, they form a cohesive whole, capturing the grandeur of the great river. The painting was organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Culture and produced by the Yangzhou Institute of Arts and Crafts.
