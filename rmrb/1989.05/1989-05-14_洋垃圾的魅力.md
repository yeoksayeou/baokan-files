It is said that in the garbage dumps of the United States, there are many discarded but still usable items such as old televisions, refrigerators, and outdated furniture. It has been reported that several major cities intend to import 720,000 tons of household waste from the United States. A feasibility report indicates that the components of the "foreign garbage" provided by the United States are not much different from our "domestic garbage." Perhaps, the main difference is that "foreign garbage" contains things like AIDS viruses, which are "special products" from abroad. So, why does "foreign garbage" still have such a great appeal to some of our compatriots? Is it because "foreign garbage" does not take up space and does not pollute the environment? Is it because our own garbage is too little, and our ability to process and handle garbage is too strong, far surpassing that of the United States? No, the real reason is that they are eyeing the "dowry" of the "foreign garbage"—the United States will subsidize $15 per ton of garbage for processing fees.

$15 per ton, 720,000 tons equals $10.8 million, which is indeed tempting. No wonder some people are eager to ask the municipal leaders to "make a quick decision"!

In reality, it is not necessarily "beneficial to the country and the people." Instead, it is a case of seeking immediate gains and "getting a small advantage but suffering a big loss"! The "small advantage" he gets, but the "big loss" will only be borne by the country. You blame him for "wanting money but not a homeland"? The money is spent today, but the homeland will not be destroyed in a day. Moreover, the homeland does not belong to any individual.

In the United States, "paying to dump garbage" has become an institution. The state, helpless, has to accept garbage dumped by individuals after paying. Unable to digest it, and unwilling to pollute the "homeland," they have no choice but to transfer it, taking money to find garbage dumps overseas. Truly admirable is the vision of Americans! Truly admirable is the courage of our compatriots in digesting garbage!

### 洋垃圾的魅力

　　洋垃圾的魅力
    曾闻，美国垃圾堆里多有废置不用的彩电、冰箱、陈旧家具等“宝贝”。得知几个大城市意欲从美国进口生活垃圾七十二万吨。可行性报告表明，美国提供的“洋垃圾”所含成份与我国的“土垃圾”并无多大差别。或许，“洋垃圾”里有而“土垃圾”里没有的，主要还是艾滋病病毒之类的“洋特产品”吧！那么，“洋垃圾”为什么对某些同胞还有如此之大的吸引力？莫非“洋垃圾”可以不占地方，不污染环境？莫非我们自己的垃圾太少，而消化、处理垃圾的能力又太强，远在美国之上？都不是，说到底，他们是看中了“洋垃圾”的“陪嫁”——美国将为每吨垃圾补贴的十五美元处理费。
    一吨十五美元，七十二万吨就是一千零八十万，确实够诱人的。难怪有些人心痒难耐，要求市领导“从速决策”呢！
    其实，“利国利民”则未必。而是急功近利，“沾小便宜吃大亏”！“小便宜”他是沾了，“吃大亏”的却只能是国家。你责备他“要钱不要家园”？钱是今天要花的，家园却不可能一日尽毁。何况，家园并不属于哪个人呢。
    在美国，“付钱丢垃圾”已形成制度。国家无奈，不得已而接受私人付款后丢出的垃圾。消化不掉，又不忍污染“家园”，只好转嫁，携资到海外寻找垃圾场。真佩服美国人的眼力！真佩服我同胞消化垃圾的魄力！　　　　刘东华
