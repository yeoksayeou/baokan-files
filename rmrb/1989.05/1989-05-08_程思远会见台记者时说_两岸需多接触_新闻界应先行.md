Program Si Yuan, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, met with journalists from Taiwan's *Economic Daily* today morning in the Great Hall of the People. He expressed his hope that Taiwan and the mainland could strengthen economic exchanges to promote the prosperity of the economies on both sides of the Taiwan Strait and in the Asia-Pacific region.

Program Si Yuan welcomed the interest of Taiwanese businesspeople in investing in the mainland. He said that the mainland attaches great importance to investments by Taiwanese businesspeople and that Taiwanese investments would receive preferential treatment.

The journalists from Taiwan's *Economic Daily*, Yu Mei Yue, Xu Yun Teng, and Zhang Yi Gong, came to Beijing to cover the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank. This is the first time that *Economic Daily* has sent journalists to the mainland for a report.

Program Si Yuan briefly introduced the mainland's policies regarding Taiwanese investments and answered their questions.

Program Si Yuan once served as the secretary to Li Zong Ren, the acting president of the Republic of China. In July 1965, he returned to the mainland with Li Zong Ren from the United States.

When discussing the Taipei delegation attending the ADB meeting, Program Si Yuan said that Ms. Guo Wan Rong performed well and was very impressive.

He said that the reunification of the two sides should follow the "one country, two systems" path, and the mainland firmly opposes any actions that would lead to long-term separation of the two sides. He said that the mainland and Taiwan have been separated for 40 years, and more contact and exchanges are needed to promote mutual understanding. He said that the media on both sides should take the lead in this regard. He hopes that Taiwanese journalists can frequently come to the mainland for reporting and more contact is beneficial.

When discussing the recent student movements on the mainland, Program Si Yuan said that various problems can only be solved through the construction of legal and democratic systems.
