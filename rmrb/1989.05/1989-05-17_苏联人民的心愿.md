The Wishes of the Soviet People

Since the beginning of this year, China Radio International has received thousands of letters from Soviet listeners. The writers include Soviet friends who worked in China in the 1950s, as well as ordinary students, teachers, engineers, experts, and scholars. Below are excerpts from some of these letters for the readers' enjoyment.

Excited for the High-Level Meeting Between China and the Soviet Union

Soviet listener O. Leonovich said, "The high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union is 'excellent.' I hope that the day when the top Chinese leaders visit the Soviet Union will come soon." Viktor Pavlovich Pukhin from Tashkent said, "The meeting of the top leaders makes me believe that 1989 will be an auspicious year for both our countries." Renowned scholar Professor Zaritsky said that the normalization of relations between the two countries is "a necessary result of human reason and logical thinking."

Wishing China's Reforms Success

Zayets from Kazakhstan said, "China has been reforming for 10 years, and we are delighted by all the achievements you have made and are inspired. We believe that the Chinese people, relying on their hard work and firm beliefs, will definitely overcome all difficulties." Zalubin from Simferopol said, "To better understand the changes in the People's Republic of China, I am seriously studying the articles by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the documents of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China published in our country." Nikolai Popovich, who worked in China in the 1950s, said, "My wife and I were in China during the ninth year of China's economic reform. China is like a giant dragon that has awakened from a long hibernation and started to dance. The Chinese people have achieved great successes in economic development, especially in agriculture, science and technology, and improving people's living standards. Of course, there are still many problems and difficulties. I believe that the Chinese communists will definitely overcome the difficulties and achieve greater victories."

"We Really Hope to Go to China"

A university teacher from Almaty wrote, "My grandmother spent her youth in China, and she and my parents told me many stories about China. I am looking forward to the day when I can go to China for a tour." A university student from Moscow wrote, "The masterpiece of Eastern art is the Great Wall of China. There is a saying among our people that if you haven't been to the Great Wall, you haven't been to China. We believe that with the changes in our country and the development of Sino-Soviet friendship, the wish to go to China will definitely be realized." Lasevichina, a female university student from Blagoveshchensk, which is across the river from Heilongjiang Province's Heihe City, said, "I really like the 'Learn Chinese' program on your radio. Learning Chinese will be useful for visiting China in the future."

　　苏联人民的心愿
    今年以来，中国国际广播电台收到数千封苏联听众来信。写信人除５０年代曾在我国工作过的苏联朋友，更多的是普通的学生、教师、工程技术人员、专家和学者。现将部分信件摘译如下，以飨读者。
    为中苏高级会晤而高兴
    苏联听众奥·列昂利维奇说，中苏两国高级会晤“好极了”，“我希望，中国最高领导人访问苏联的日子将为期不远了。”塔什干的维克托·巴甫洛维奇·普金来夫说：“最高级领导人的会晤使我深信，１９８９年对于我们两国来说将是吉祥的一年。”著名学者扎里茨基教授说，两国关系正常化是“人的理智和逻辑思考的一种必然结果”。
    祝愿中国改革取得成功
    哈萨克的扎耶茨说：“中国进行改革已有１０个年头，我们为你们取得的所有成就感到欣喜，并受到鼓舞。我们相信，中国人民依靠自己的勤劳和坚定的信念一定能够克服遇到的所有困难。”辛菲罗波尔市的扎鲁宾来信说：“为了更好地了解中华人民共和国发生的变化，我正认真研读我国出版的邓小平同志的文章和中共１３大文件。”５０年代曾在中国工作过的尼·波波维奇说：“我和妻子在中国旅游的时候，正是中国进行经济体制改革的第９个年头。中国像是一条巨龙，经过长时期的冬眠，觉醒了，舞动起来。中国人民在经济发展中特别是在农业、科技以及提高人民生活方面取得了巨大成就。当然，现在还存在不少问题和困难。我相信，中国共产党人一定能克服困难，走向更大的胜利。”
    “我们非常希望去中国”
    阿拉木图的一位大学教师来信说：“我祖母青年时代是在中国度过的，她和父母亲给我讲了许多中国的故事，我盼望着去中国旅游的日子早一天到来。”莫斯科的一位大学生在信中说：“东方艺术的杰作是中国的万里长城。我们民间流传着一句话，没有去过长城就等于没有去过中国。我们相信，随着我国发生的变革以及苏中友好关系的发展，到中国去的愿望一定能实现。”与黑龙江省黑河市隔江相望的布拉戈维申斯克的女大学生拉谢美金娜说：“我非常喜欢收听你们广播中的‘学汉语’节目，学会中国话，将来好到中国参观访问。”
