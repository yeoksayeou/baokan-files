	Gunshots on the Train
	Li Guomin

	On the night of February 27 this year, the head of the South Jiang County People's Court in Sichuan, Zheng Kaicheng, was returning home from Chengdu by train. Around one in the morning, many passengers were already dozing off.

	At this moment, a criminal stood up and began searching the passengers for money. Several passengers watched as the criminal searched them, trembling with fear, only hoping to protect themselves and not daring to make a sound. When the criminal reached Zheng Kaicheng, he reached out to grab the wallet of the passenger sitting opposite him. Zheng, who was already furious, shouted, "What are you doing?" The criminal glanced at this 50-something-year-old, thin man and suddenly turned to grab him. Before the criminal could react, Zheng pulled out a gun from his clothing and shouted, "Hand over what you've taken immediately, or don't blame me for being rude!" The criminal lunged forward to grab the gun. In an instant, Zheng fired a shot at the criminal's shoulder. The gunshot woke up all the passengers on the train. The cunning criminal took the opportunity to bite back, shouting, "Catch the armed fugitive!" The other criminals also swarmed in. Zheng immediately jumped onto the seat, holding the gun with both hands, and shouted, "I am a court officer, please lie down!" He then handed his gun permit to the conductor who had come to maintain order. When the conductor shouted, "He is the head of the court!" the criminals were so frightened that they fled through the window. The injured criminal was caught by the conductor and the stolen items were confiscated on the spot.

　　列车上的枪声
    李国民
    今年２月２７日夜，四川南江县人民法院院长郑开清从成都乘坐火车返家。深夜一点左右，不少旅客已昏昏欲睡。
    这时一名歹徒站起来开始搜旅客的钱。有几名旅客看着歹徒搜身，吓得直打哆嗦，只求保自身，不敢吭声。当歹徒来到郑开清身旁，伸手摸他对面旅客腰包时，早已怒不可遏的老郑厉声喝道：“你们干什么？”歹徒瞟了一眼这位５０来岁的瘦个子，猛地转手向他伸来。说时迟，那时快，老郑从衣内掏出手枪，大声喝道：“赶快把你扒的东西交出来，否则别怪我不客气！”歹徒猛扑过来夺枪。老郑对着歹徒的肩膀“砰”地开了一枪，枪声惊醒了全车的旅客。狡猾的歹徒趁机反咬一口，高喊：“抓带枪的逃犯！”其他歹徒也蜂拥而至。老郑立即跳上座位，双手端着手枪，大声吼道：“我是法院干警，请旅客趴下。”接着将持枪证递给前来维持秩序的乘警。当乘警大声喊出“他是法院院长”时，歹徒们吓得夺窗而逃，那个被击伤的歹徒被乘警抓了起来，并当场交出了赃物。
