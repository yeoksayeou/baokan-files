Qiao Hong, with her round face, bright eyes, and cheerful demeanor, was born with a cheerful disposition. Her first participation in the World Table Tennis Championships saw her unexpectedly become both the singles and doubles world champion. At just 21 years old, she also invented a little-known serve, which is even more astonishing.

Last autumn, in the Foshan Gymnasium, Qiao Hong was competing against Hebei's national team player Fan Jianxin for the women's singles final in the National Games. In the fifth set, Fan fought more fiercely, but Qiao suddenly felt her wrist stiffen. Seeing that she was about to lose, she had a sudden inspiration and boldly served a "baseball." Fan was startled, missed the return, and Qiao served it again, and Fan missed again! Qiao seized the opportunity and narrowly secured her place in the final...

"Without this serve, perhaps I wouldn't have made it into the national team," she reminisced two nights ago, sitting cross-legged on the small bed in her dormitory. Seeing the writer's bewilderment, she smiled and said, "At that time, Chen Jing and Hu Xiaoxuan had already made it into the national team. My provincial team coach, Feng Mengya, encouraged me: 'If you want to enter the national team, you must have outstanding results. Otherwise, how can the national team recruit three people from Hubei at once?' I won the singles runner-up in the National Games, and I finally made it into the national team."

Last month, in the women's singles final of the 40th World Table Tennis Championships, she won the first two sets but was tied 2-2 by Lee Bun-Hee. Before the fourth set, Coach Zhang Qiu asked her if she dared to serve the "baseball." She shook her head, thinking it was better to play it safe in the decisive match. However, Lee Bun-Hee, who had just eliminated Olympic champion Chen Jing, played more accurately and her momentum grew stronger. The time had come for desperate measures. She steeled herself, twisted her wrist, and suddenly served the "baseball." Lee Bun-Hee was taken aback, returned the ball high, and Qiao smashed it down! This scene repeated several times, and Lee Bun-Hee lost her composure...

"How is this serve executed? How was it developed?"

She blinked her eyes and smiled but said nothing. The writer pressed on, and she finally whispered:

"Three years ago, when I was in the Hubei team, after one training session, I saw Liang Hong'an (a male player who uses a direct grip with reverse rubber for fast attacks) serving with the back of his racket. I thought it was fun and tried it too. While playing around, I suddenly realized some tricks, and according to the characteristics of the horizontal grip, I kept improving it, and its power gradually increased."

"This serve's action is not very standard, and maybe someone thinks it's just messing around. I don't care what others say, I just keep practicing it in secret and use it at critical moments. I think an athlete, in addition to pursuing all-around skills, must also dare to practice and use unconventional new tricks."

### 乔红和她的“野球”

　　乔红和她的“野球”
    圆脸，善眼，爱笑，乔红生就一副喜性相。头一次参加世乒赛，她一举成为单、双打世界冠军，已让人意外；２１岁的她，还独创了一种鲜为人知的发球，或许更令人瞠目。
    前年秋，佛山体育馆，她与河北籍国手樊建欣争夺全运会女单决赛权之战打到第５局，樊愈战愈勇，她却突然手腕发硬。眼瞅着要输，她灵机一动，壮着胆发了个“野球”。樊一惊，吃了，再发，又吃了！她乘虚而入险获决赛权……
    “没这个发球，或许我进不了国家队。”前两天晚上，她盘腿坐在宿舍的小床上感慨。见笔者茫然，她笑道：“当时陈静、胡小新已进了国家队，省队的冯梦雅教练给我鼓劲：‘你要想进入国家队，必须有更突出的成绩，不然国家队怎么好从湖北队一下招三个人？’全运会拿了单打亚军，我总算进了国家队。”
    上个月，第４０届世乒赛女单决赛，她先赢两局，被李粉姬扳回一局。第４局上场前，曾传强教练问她敢不敢发那个“野球”？她摇头，心想决战关头还是稳点好。谁知，刚刚淘汰了奥运会冠军陈静的李粉姬越打越准，气势愈发旺盛。万不得已的时候到了，她心一横，手腕一拧，突然将“野球”发出。李粉姬吓一跳，回球偏高，被她一扳扣死！如此镜头反复数次，李粉姬方寸大乱……
    “这个球怎么发？怎么练出来的？”
    她扑闪着眼睛，笑而不语。笔者刨根问底不止，她才轻声道：
    “３年前在湖北队，有一次训练结束，见梁红安（男，直拍反胶快攻手）正手用拍子的背面发球，我觉得挺好玩，也学着发。玩着玩着，我突然悟出点门道，按照横握拍的特点不断改进，威力渐渐大了起来。”
    “发这个球的动作不那么正规，也许有人觉得是瞎胡闹吧。我不管人家怎么说，一直闷头练，关键时刻才冷丁用一下。我觉得，一个运动员除了要追求技术全面，还必须敢练，敢用不合常规的新招。”
