The Brazilian Santos Football Club will visit China in August this year, playing seven matches against several strong Chinese teams in cities such as Beijing and Tianjin.

Chinese Football Association Deputy Secretary-General Yang Xiuwu announced that this is the second visit by a Brazilian professional football club to China since the Madureira team's visit in 1964. The Santos team is renowned for having nurtured the world's greatest footballer, Pelé. Currently, the team features famous players such as Socrates and Júnior, who will all come to perform. For the Chinese football community, which is currently exploring the development of professional football, this visit is a valuable opportunity to learn about the management of professional teams and the consciousness and ethical standards of professional players in a football-developed country.
