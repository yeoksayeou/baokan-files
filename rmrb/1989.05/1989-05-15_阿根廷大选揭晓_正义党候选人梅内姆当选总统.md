The Justice Party-led People's Unity and Justice Front (an electoral alliance led by the Justice Party) won the election held yesterday. Carlos Menem and Eduardo Duhalde have effectively been elected as the next President and Vice President of the Argentine Republic.

According to the official vote count, in the 70% of the votes that have been tallied, the People's Unity and Justice Front received 47.9% of the votes, while the ruling Radical Civic Union received 33%. The Argentine Constitution stipulates that the presidential election is an indirect election. The first round of voting selects 600 electors, and the candidate who receives more than half of the electoral votes is elected. Based on the current voting trend of the People's Unity and Justice Front, they can secure more than 300 electoral votes. Therefore, Menem has effectively been elected as President.

The incumbent President Alfonsín and the Radical Party candidate have both sent congratulatory messages to Menem.

The current government will hand over power to the new government on December 10th. Menem stated that the party does not consider the issue of requesting an early transfer of power.

　　阿根廷大选揭晓    
    正义党候选人梅内姆当选总统
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯５月１５日电  记者李志明报道：以正义党为主的人民团结正义阵线（以正义党为主体的选举联盟）在昨天举行的大选中获胜，卡罗斯·梅内姆和爱德华多·杜阿尔特已实际当选为下任阿根廷共和国总统、副总统。
    根据官方公布的计票结果，在已经统计的７０％的选票中，人民团结正义阵线的票占４７．９％，执政党激进公民联盟的票占３３％。阿根廷宪法规定，总统选举为间接选举。第一轮投票选举６００名选举人，得选举人票过半数者当选。按照人民团结正义阵线目前得票趋势，可以稳得３００张以上选举人票，因此，梅内姆实际上已经当选总统。
    现任总统阿方辛和激进党候选人已经分别致电梅内姆向他表示祝贺。
    本届政府将于１２月１０日向新政府交接政权。梅内姆表示，政党不考虑要求提前交权的问题。
