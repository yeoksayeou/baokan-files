	Symposium on Hu Feng's Literary Thought Held in Wuhan
	Scholars point out that the lessons from Hu Feng's tragedy lie in the necessity for academic freedom in the scholarly realm and the elimination of cultural despotism

	Wuhan, May 24 (Reporter Gong Dafa) — History has played a trick: what was once a "poisonous weed" for criticism — Hu Feng's literary thought — has now become a precious cultural heritage for experts and scholars to discuss and study. From May 15 to 19, a group of scholars gathered in Hu Feng's hometown, Hubei, to hold the first national symposium on Hu Feng's literary thought.

	Critics praised Hu Feng as an outstanding literary critic and theorist with creativity, unique personality, and his own theoretical system in contemporary Chinese literature. He was also a righteous poet. In the mid-1950s, Hu Feng was imprisoned for 25 years for criticizing literary practices since the founding of the country and submitting a "300,000-character letter." He inherited the patriotic poet Qu Yuan's noble character and scholarly integrity of "receiving a mission without changing" and "even if dying nine times, still not regretting." With the pain of "Lament for the Departed," he finally endured 25 years of imprisonment. Facing political storms, academic attacks, and physical torture, he insisted on his correct academic views and did not yield, remaining "independent and unyielding." He completely abandoned the general scholar's adherence to the saying "transmit but do not create" and dared to create his own theory, never repeating or interpreting the leader's theory, leaving a valuable cultural heritage for future generations. Therefore, the participants called him a faithful inheritor of Lu Xun's spirit.

	Reflecting on the historical fate of Hu Feng's literary thought, scholars deeply felt the extreme importance of academic freedom and the elimination of cultural despotism in the scholarly realm.

	The symposium was initiated by the Chinese Writers' Association and Hu Feng's hometown, Shiqian County, Hubei. Participants included old writers who were once supported and influenced by Hu Feng, as well as a large number of young and middle-aged scholars who have made significant contributions to the study of Hu Feng's literary thought.

　　胡风文艺思想讨论会在武汉召开
    学者们指出，胡风悲剧值得吸取的教训在于，学术领域必须实行学术自由，根除文化专制主义
    本报武汉电  记者龚达发报道：历史开了一个“玩笑”——以前一直是供批判的“毒草”——胡风文艺思想，现在成了一份珍贵的文化遗产，供专家学者讨论研究。５月１５日至１９日，一批学者聚首胡风故乡——湖北，召开全国首次胡风文艺思想学术讨论会。
    评论家们称胡风是我国当代文学事业中一位具有创造性、独特个性并有自己理论体系的杰出文学批评家、理论家，一位正直的诗人。５０年代中期，胡风因对建国以来文艺实践提出批评，上“三十万言书”而蒙受牢狱之灾达２５年之久。他承继了同乡爱国诗人屈原“受命不迁”、“虽九死其犹未悔”的崇高人格和学术品格，带着“离骚”式的痛苦，终于从长达２５年的冤狱中挺了过来。面对政治上的惊涛骇浪、学术上的围攻讨伐、肉体的摧残迫害，他坚持自己正确的学术观点，没有屈服，“独立不迁”。他完全抛弃了一般文人遵循的“述而不作”的圣人之言，敢于创造自己的理论，决不复述、诠释领袖的理论，为后人留下一份宝贵的文化遗产。因此，与会者称他是鲁迅精神忠实的继承者。
    回首胡风文艺思想历史命运，学者们深感学术领域必须实行学术自由，根除文化专制主义的极端重要性。
    会议由中国作协、胡风故乡——湖北蕲春县等单位发起，与会者有当年受胡风扶持、熏陶的老作家，也有大批对胡风文艺思想研究卓有建树的中青年学者。
