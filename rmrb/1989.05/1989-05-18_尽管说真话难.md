Despite the difficulty of speaking the truth...

Many revolutionary forerunners and teachers have already left this world forever, but their spirits and demeanor remain in my memory. Those who are still alive are also in their twilight years, and the days we share with them will not be many. I miss them, so I have left some fragmentary records about them. Of course, there is still much more I want to write...

In the old society, the people had no freedom of speech and could only express their protests through silence. When the people stood up, the five hundred million masses at that time were overjoyed and poured out their heartfelt sentiments. However, for a long time, only one tone was allowed, with no differences in high, medium, or low pitches; it was a "standard tone" where one sings and a hundred echo. Who would have thought that speaking the truth would be so difficult? Sometimes, one must pay the price of spiritual and physical pain, even life itself. An old friend I have known for fifty years said that I have been forced to remain silent for twenty-two years, but the time should actually be pushed back two more years. Twelve years ago, the "Cultural Revolution," which was dyed with revolutionary colors but was actually feudal tyranny, finally ended, and the land welcomed a glimmer of dawn. After ten years of turmoil, such a riddled mess was left behind. Those lingering shadows of the past are not something that can disappear in an instant; sometimes they flicker and dance, still performing a demonic dance.

The 18th-century French Revolution Declaration, though it has been 200 years, still looks as fresh as new. Seventy years ago, the "May Fourth Movement" called for "Mr. Democracy" and "Mr. Science," and their voices still ring in our ears, yet they have come so late. Marxism spread in China, and it has also been decades. But for this great country of China, to take a step forward is so difficult! Must our generation of writers still have to retread the path that Lu Xun walked? This is a great mockery of history and is heartbreaking. However, I firmly believe that those things that should not have happened can often be avoided in the process of reform. People having different views or differences in understanding on some issues is a normal social phenomenon. Fortunately, the severe winter has passed, and the bright spring light has descended upon the world. Our impoverished home, to be honest, can no longer afford major mistakes. We can no longer pay the exorbitant "tuition" of a "Great Leap Forward" and an unprecedented "Great Revolution." Let us speak the truth to the people, and let the people speak the truth! Speaking the truth is the basic premise of freedom of speech.

May heaven bless China!

　　尽管说真话难……
    舒湮
    许多革命前辈和师友已经永远离开人间了，但他们的精神和风采永远留在我的记忆之中，其存者亦都步入耄耋之年，和我们共同生活的日子不会太多了。我怀念他们，因而留下了有关他们的片断记载。当然，我要写的还有很多，很多……
    旧社会，人民没有说话的自由，只能以沉默表示抗议。到了人民站起来了，当时的五亿群众欢欣鼓舞，倾诉着肺腑衷肠。然而在很长一个时间内，只允许有一个调门，没有高、中、低音的差别，是一唱百诺的“标准音”。想不到说真话这样难，有时必须付出精神和肉体上的痛苦甚至生命的代价。一位相交五十年的故人，说我已经被迫缄默了二十二年，其实时间还应更推前两年。十二年前，涂上革命色彩的封建专横的“文革”终于结束了，大地迎来了一线曙光。经过十年动乱之后留下这样一个千疮百孔的摊子，那些逝而不去的时代阴影，不是转瞬间得以消失的，有时鬼影幢幢忽隐忽现，犹作天魔狂舞。
    １８世纪法兰西大革命宣言，虽历２００年而墨渖如新。７０年前“五四”召唤的“德先生”与“赛先生”，声犹在耳，却又何其姗姗来迟。马克思主义传播中土，也时逾数十载。可是，我们这个老大的中国，要想迈出一步，又何其艰难呵！我们这一代的作者，难道还须沿着鲁迅走过的道路重复才行？这真是对历史极大的讽嘲，也是令人痛心的。但是，我深信那些本不该发生的事，在改革的进程中往往是可以避免的。人们对一些问题怀有不同的看法或认识上的差别，是正常的社会现象。所幸严寒的冬日已经过去，明媚的春光已降临人间。我们这个贫窭之家，说实在的，再也经不起大失误了，再也付不起一次“大跃进”和一次史无前例的“大革命”已经付出过的如此昂贵的“学费”了。对人民说真话，让人民说真话吧！说真话是言论自由的起码前提。
    天佑中华！
