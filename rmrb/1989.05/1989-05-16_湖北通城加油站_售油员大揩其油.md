On the afternoon of March 16, we were driving five vehicles from Liuzhou, Guangxi, back to Lianyungang. When we stopped at the Tongcheng County Petroleum Company fuel station in Hubei to refuel, we encountered an unpleasant incident.

That day, the female fuel attendant on duty heard that we wanted to buy 500 kilograms of gasoline. She immediately demanded a carton of Huayuan brand cigarettes. She also said that the cost of the cigarettes could be included in the fuel purchase invoice. We said many nice things, and finally, she agreed to let us buy 490 kilograms of gasoline with the payment for 500 kilograms. When we went to the oil depot with the pickup order to refuel, we were again deducted 15 kilograms of gasoline, totaling 46.70 yuan taken from us without reason.

　　湖北通城加油站　售油员大揩其油
    ３月１６日下午，我们一行驾驶着５辆车从广西柳州返回连云港，途经湖北通城县石油公司加油站加油时，碰到一件令人不快的事。
    那天，当班的女售油员听说我们要买５００公斤汽油，立即提出给她一条画苑牌香烟。她还说，烟钱可以记入购油的发票。我们说了许多好话，最后她同意我们用５００公斤汽油款买４９０公斤汽油。我们拿着提货单去油库加油时，又被截去１５公斤汽油，前后无故被他们多拿走４６．７０元。
