The round face of the sun, seemingly wet with dew, emerges from behind the dark blue mountains; the winding body of a valley, like an evergreen vine, appears from the milky white mist; a sparkling stream steps forth from the narrow base of the cliff; a lush meadow spreads out from the rugged rocky shore. On the other side of the valley, wisps of smoke drift like a dream; on this side of the water valley, paths appear like a maze...

The dazzling glow of the clouds, the fluffy clouds, the lush trees, the green grass, and the clusters of flowers burning like flames weave together into a kaleidoscope of colors; the tender bird songs, the scattered cattle and sheep, the drifting hats, the moving figures, and the crystal-like dew that sparkles endlessly paint a vibrant spring world.

The earth is warm and fermenting.
The fragrance of flowers is intoxicatingly rich.

Looking up, the boundless blue sky is filled with the pure and carefree spirit of a lyric poem; looking down, the tranquil valley is crystal clear, presenting the refined and exquisite beauty of a lacquer painting.

It seems that with every glance, one can absorb the life force of nature; it seems that with every glance, one can gain the vigorous energy of the soul!

Thus, I involuntarily walked into the spring sunshine of the valley; thus, I couldn't help but sing the heart-warming and delightful songs...

	Public Park: Evening Sketches

The setting sun almost dozes off in the lazy clouds, and the hazy sky, unwilling to fade, paints a soft red glow.
The serene mountains float in the distance; the gentle leaves hang over the lake, in the most beautiful posture, listening to the whispers of the lake waves like cream, feeling the breath of the silk-like waves, silently admiring the curves of the lake water like a crystal plate...

A sentiment from ancient times, accompanied by popular music, blends into the evening twilight with a faint fragrance.
The long corridor, the small pavilion, the people who have forgotten to return, are still lost in thought, still seeking something, allowing the elusive thoughts to tremble with secret joys, waiting for the dazzling starlight to announce the night's stories.

What is lost at the bottom of the deep lake? Perhaps only one person knows.
But those standing in the evening glow do not know how beautiful they are!

    山谷春晴（外一章）
    朱谷忠
    从暗蓝色的山岭后探露出圆脸的，是那一轮看似水淋淋的红日；从乳白色的雾气里蜿蜒出腰身的，是那一道宛若常青藤的山谷；从狭窄的崖底下款步而来的，是那一条闪亮的泉流；从险峻的石滩上铺展过来的，是那一片润泽的草地。山谷那边，梦幻似的飘着一缕缕炊烟；水谷这边，迷津般的现出一条条小径……
    焕灿的霞光，蓬松的云岚，丰盈的树木，青翠的草丛，以及火焰般燃烧的成簇成团的花朵，交织成一个色彩纷呈的万花筒；娇嫩的鸟啼，散落的牛羊，飘移的斗笠，蠕动的人影，以及水晶般闪亮的漫无际涯的莹露，勾画出一个生机盎然的春世界。
    地气，暖得发酵。
    花香，浓得心醉。
    向上一望，无际的碧空日光熠熠，充满了抒情诗般的天真洒脱；向下一望，渊静的山谷澄鲜无比，呈现着磨漆画般的圆熟精湛。
    仿佛，多看一眼，就能吮吸到大自然生命的气息；仿佛，多看一眼，就能获致那灵魂中旺盛的精力！
    就这样，我身不由己地走进了山谷的春晴；就这样，我情不自禁地唱起了那爽心惬意的歌谣……
      公园：黄昏漫笔
    斜阳几乎在慵悃的云中睡着了，朦胧的空中，不肯消逝的烟霞，渲染着柔美的晕红。
    静穆的山峦，在远方浮动着；柔静的树叶垂向湖面，以最美的姿势，聆听着奶酪般湖波的絮语，感受着丝绸般轻浪的呼吸，默视着冰盘般湖水的曲线……
    一种溢自远古的意绪，伴随着流行乐曲，揉进了飘着淡香的暮色。
    长廊，小亭，忘归的人，还在默默地出神，还在缘木以求着什么，一任飘缈的思绪，颤动秘密的惊喜，等待眩目的星光，预告夜的故事。
    是什么失落在沉沉的湖底呢？也许只有一个人知道。
    可伫立在黄昏里的人，却不知道自己也多么美丽！
