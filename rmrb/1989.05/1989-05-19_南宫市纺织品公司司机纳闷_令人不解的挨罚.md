Our city is adjacent to Ji County, and we often drive through Ji County's Zhoucun Town to reach Hengshui. On March 28, as we passed through this area, a traffic police officer said, "If you're driving a car from Nan Gong Textile Company, you'd better bring more money, because you're going to get fined." Sure enough, the next day, one of our drivers was fined without any reason. The traffic police officer said, "As long as you're driving a car from the Textile Company, I'll find a reason to fine you." This year, we have driven to Hengshui multiple times, and almost every time we pass through Zhoucun Town, we get fined. On March 29, we found a list on the door of the traffic police inspection room in Zhoucun Town, and our company was listed as a key unit for vehicle impoundment.

If we are fined for violating traffic rules, we would accept it. However, being fined just for the name of our company is something we cannot understand.

　　南宫市纺织品公司司机纳闷    
    令人不解的挨罚
    我市与冀县相邻，我们途经冀县周村镇到衡水出车的机会较多。３月２８日，我们驾车路过此地，一交通民警说：“南宫纺织品公司的车路过此地，需多带些钱来，准备挨罚。”果然，第二天我们中的一位司机又无缘无故被罚了款。这位交通民警说：“只要你们开纺织品公司的车，我就找个毛病罚你们。”今年以来，我们多次出车衡水，每次经过周村镇几乎都挨罚。３月２９日，我们在周村镇交通民警检查室门窗上发现，我公司被列为重点扣车单位。
    如果违章行车被罚款，我们服气。可是，见“名”就罚，实在令我们不能理解。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　河北南宫市纺织品公司司机
