On May 19, after 402 days in office, Italian Prime Minister De Mita submitted his resignation, leading to a crisis in the 47th government of the Italian Republic. The primary reason for this was the conflict between the two major parties in the coalition government—the Christian Democrats and the Socialist Party.

The De Mita government, formed in April of last year, was a coalition of the Christian Democrats, Socialist Party, Social Democrats, Republican Party, and Liberal Party, based on a common platform. The two main goals of this platform were to control and gradually reduce the national debt and to implement political system reforms. In today's Italy, any government aiming to achieve even a basic level of authority and stability must address these two major issues. The impending arrival of the European Single Market in 1992 has made these issues even more urgent. However, the participating parties in the De Mita government, particularly the Socialist Party and the Christian Democrats, had differing opinions and sharp conflicts, making the government's crisis inevitable.

The past year was considered another "golden year" for the Italian economy, but it was also a year in which the opportunity to control the fiscal deficit was lost. Although the De Mita government had taken four consecutive measures to increase revenue and cut spending, the results were minimal, and the absolute amount of the fiscal deficit continued to rise: 113.47 trillion lire in 1987, 124.449 trillion lire in 1988, and an estimated 134.4 trillion lire in 1989. The proportion of the fiscal deficit in the gross domestic product has remained at a high level of 11.5% for the past three years. The national debt has accumulated to 907.842 trillion lire in 1987, 1037 trillion lire in 1988, and an estimated 1174.9 trillion lire in 1989. The inflation rate has risen from 5% in recent months to nearly 7%. Faced with this situation, the Socialist Party intended to distance itself from the Christian Democrats, and the De Mita government had twice been on the brink of crisis due to tax reduction measures and medical fee issues.

In terms of political system reform, the De Mita government achieved some important results, such as abolishing secret voting in parliament, adjusting the prime minister's office, beginning criminal law reform, and establishing new government universities and research departments. However, the overall political system reform is considered to have entered a "deadlock": the reform of local government agencies has been delayed in the House of Representatives and has made slow progress; the reform of the bicameral system has encountered difficulties in the Senate; and in terms of electoral reform, there are differing opinions, with the Socialist Party's proposal for direct election of the head of state and the implementation of a presidential system receiving little support. Friction between the Christian Democrats and the Socialist Party frequently occurs. The Christian Democrats, along with the Italian Communist Party, participate in certain local governments, particularly the recent government of Palermo, the capital of Sicily, which excludes the Socialist Party. The Socialist Party was extremely upset by this and had caused the De Mita government to be on the brink of crisis once again.

From May 13 to 19, the 45th National Congress of the Socialist Party held in Milan strongly criticized the De Mita government. Socialist Party leaders stated that there is actually a chronic political crisis eroding the coalition government, and the parliamentary majority needs to conduct a political review. "This political phase has ended, and it is necessary to start clarifying the situation afterward." On May 19, during his closing speech at the congress, Craxi explicitly stated that Socialist Party ministers should "urge the convening of a cabinet meeting to clarify the necessary political and procedural issues," which was tantamount to announcing the crisis of the De Mita government. However, Craxi accused De Mita of saying during the Socialist and Republican Party congresses that he no longer knew who his allies were, which created a crisis among the majority in parliament. That afternoon, after a brief cabinet meeting, De Mita submitted his resignation to President Cossiga.

President Cossiga has begun the first round of consultations with former presidents, the presidents of the two houses, and the leaders of various political parties. So far, all parties have expressed the hope to quickly resolve the government crisis and avoid the possibility of early elections. The future remains uncertain.

　　意大利总理为何辞职
    本报记者  罗晋标
    ５月１９日，执政４０２天的意大利政府总理德米塔提出辞职，意大利共和国第４７届政府发生危机，究其原因，主要是联合政府中的两大党——天民党和社会党之间发生矛盾的结果。
    去年４月组成的德米塔政府是天民党、社会党、社民党、共和党和自由党在共同纲领基础上组成的联合政府。这个共同纲领的两个首要目标是：控制并逐步减少国债，实行政治体制改革。在今天的意大利，任何一届政府如要获得起码的权威和稳定，绝不能回避这两大难题，而１９９２年欧洲统一大市场的日益临近，又使之变得更为紧迫。然而参加德米塔政府的各党、特别是社会党和天民党之间意见分歧，矛盾尖锐，致使德米塔政府的危机势不可免。
    过去的一年，被认为是意大利经济的又一个“黄金年”，但又是在控制财政赤字方面“失去良机的一年”。德米塔政府虽然曾连续采取４次增收节支的经济措施，但效果甚微，财政赤字的绝对数仍在继续上升：１９８７年为１１３．４７万亿里拉，１９８８年增至１２４．４４９万亿里拉，１９８９年预计要达到１３４．４万亿里拉；财政赤字在国内生产总值中的比例３年来一直钉死在１１．５％的高水平上。国债累计，１９８７年为９０７．８４２万亿里拉，１９８８年增至１０３７万亿里拉，１９８９年估计要达到１１７４．９万亿里拉。通膨率近几个月从５％上升到接近７％。面对如此情况，社会党有与天民党“拉开距离”之意，德米塔政府曾因减税措施和医疗收费问题而先后两次濒于危机。
    在政治体制改革方面，德米塔政府取得了某些重要成果，例如取消议会秘密投票，调整总理府机构，开始进行刑法改革，新建政府的大学和科研部。但是整个政治体制改革被认为走进了“死轨”：关于地方政府机关的改革在众议院被拖拉而进展缓慢；关于两院制的改革在参院遇到困难；在选举改革方面，意见分歧，社会党提出的直接选举国家元首、实行总统制的建议，和者居少数。天民党和社会党之间的摩擦经常发生。天民党与意共一起参加某些地方政府、特别是前不久西西里首府巴勒摩市政府有天民党和意共参加而把社会党排斥在外，社会党对此极为恼火，曾使德米塔政府又一次濒临危机。
    于５月１３日至１９日在米兰召开的社会党第４５届全国代表大会强烈批评德米塔政府。社会党领导人声称，实际上有个慢性政治危机在侵蚀联合政府，议会多数有必要进行一次政治检查”，“这个政治阶段已经完结了，此后应当开始澄清”。５月１９日，克拉克西在代表大会上作总结发言时明确提出要社会党人部长“敦促召开内阁会议，以进行必要的政治和程序上的澄清”，这就等于宣告了德米塔政府的危机。但克拉克西指控德米塔总理在社会党和共和党代表大会期间说他不再知道谁是其盟友，这就造成了议会多数人的危机。当天下午，德米塔总理在召开了简短的内阁会议后便向科西加总统提出了辞职。
    科西加总统今天已开始进行与前总统、两院议长、各政党领导人的第一轮磋商。至此各党均表示希望尽速解决政府危机，并不希望出现提前大选的局面。前景如何，尚难预料。
