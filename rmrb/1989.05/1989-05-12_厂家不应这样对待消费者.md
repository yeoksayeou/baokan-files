Manufacturers Should Not Treat Consumers This Way

In September 1987, I purchased a ladies' watch from a store in Shaoyang City, produced by the Shanghai Diamond Watch Factory. After using it for less than two days, the watch stopped working. Within the warranty period, I took it to the store's repair department for repairs no less than 10 times, but it was never fixed properly. The repair technicians and sales staff advised me to send the watch to the manufacturer for repair. To be cautious, in September 1988, I wrote a letter to the factory seeking their advice on how to handle the issue, but there was no response for over three months. In early January of this year, I wrote another letter to the manufacturer and had the store where I purchased the watch stamp it to confirm that the watch I bought indeed had quality issues. I sent the watch along with the letter to the Shanghai Diamond Watch Factory. In mid-March, I received the watch back from the manufacturer, but upon testing, it was still not working. Subsequently, I wrote a letter to the factory director criticizing their irresponsibility towards consumers, but they did not respond.

### 厂家不应这样对待消费者

　　厂家不应这样对待消费者
    我于１９８７年９月从邵阳市某商店买回一只上海钻石手表厂生产的女式手表，使用不到２天就停摆了。在保修期内，我去商店修理部修理不下１０次，可总也修不好。修理师傅和营业员要我把表寄到生产厂家修理。为慎重起见，１９８８年９月，我写信与厂里联系，征求他们的处理意见，可３个多月杳无音讯。今年元月初我又给厂家写信，并到出售商店盖章证明所购手表确属质量问题，把表与信一齐寄往上海钻石手表厂。３月中旬收到了厂家寄回的手表，可一试验，仍然是只“死表”。接着，我给厂长写去一信，批评他们对消费者不负责任，他们也不予理睬。
