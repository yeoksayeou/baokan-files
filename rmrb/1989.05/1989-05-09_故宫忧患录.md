The Perils of the Forbidden City

By Fu Dinggen, Reporter

Last October, Zhao Zhanfeng, a security officer at the Palace Museum, reported to our newspaper about several urgent issues in the museum's fire prevention, anti-theft measures, and cultural relic protection. Based on his report, we conducted an investigation into these problems.

Fire Hazards: Continuous Incidents

The Palace Museum, originally known as the Forbidden City, was the imperial palace of the Ming and Qing dynasties. It is the largest and most complete group of ancient buildings in China. The museum covers an area of 720,000 square meters, with over 90 courtyards and more than 8,700 rooms, totaling 150,000 square meters of building space. The northern part of the palace, known as the Inner Court, has a very dense layout of buildings, with houses closely packed together. Many of the main halls in the southern part, known as the Outer Court, are built on high platforms or city walls. These wooden structures, if they catch fire, would be difficult to extinguish.

In recent years, the Palace Museum has faced numerous fire hazards. Paper incinerators have caught fire; electric bells have burned red; wires have burned out; luxurious carpets in the palace have been scorched by lighting; electrical panels in the palace halls have sparked and burned multiple times, and so on. Before the Spring Festival this year, the director of the Palace Museum's office allowed a television station to film inside without proper authorization. In the Yanmen Gate, in 1985, the Cultural Relics Store stored 1,800 flammable material baskets, which increased to nearly 14,000 by March of this year. Most seriously, on the night of August 24, 1987, the Jingyang Palace was struck by lightning and caught fire, burning 80 square meters of the roof, causing the southern eaves to collapse and the southwest corner to fall, resulting in significant damage.

The Jingyang Palace fire exposed many issues in the Palace Museum's fire safety. For example, the museum lacks fire alarm systems and modern firefighting equipment.

Fire Protection Engineering: Delayed Indefinitely

The central government and the State Council have always attached great importance to the safety of the Palace Museum. During an inspection of the Palace Museum, a central leader pointed out that fire prevention must be given top priority. As early as June 1986, the State Council approved a special fund of 20.08 million yuan for the implementation of the "Palace Museum Fire Protection Facilities Plan" (this plan was completed in 1983 by the Ministry of Public Security, which organized renowned fire protection experts from across the country to conduct extensive research). In the instructions, the State Council leaders clearly stated: "The fire protection project for the Palace Museum cannot be delayed any further. Starting this year, construction must be expedited to prevent any problems."

The First Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security, commissioned by the Palace Museum, spent nearly a year and invested 10 million yuan to extensively consult with experts from various fields. Based on the principles and requirements of the "Palace Museum Fire Protection Facilities Plan," they formulated a comprehensive plan for phased implementation in the Palace Museum in April 1988. Experts believe that this plan has made significant progress in proposing specific requirements and implementation methods for various safety systems in the Palace Museum, especially in fully implementing the "Palace Museum Fire Protection Facilities Plan." It has also gained the approval of ancient architecture experts and fire supervision departments.

The Palace Museum did not organize a review of this comprehensive plan and did not submit it for approval. Instead, they commissioned another design unit to create a "Palace Museum Fire Protection Water Supply Network System Design Plan."

This design plan was not approved at the review meeting held in November 1988, attended by relevant higher-level and fire supervision department experts. The Beijing Municipal Fire Bureau's document (Beijing Fire Bureau Review No. 432, 1988) pointed out: "The fire protection water supply system of the Palace Museum is part of the overall fire protection system and is closely related to fire alarm, fire control, and other systems. Discussing only the layout of the pump room and outdoor pipeline of the fire protection water supply system without a comprehensive design does not meet the requirements of system design." "The fire protection water supply plan discussed this time is incomplete. Compared to the water supply fire protection system approved by the State Council in the 'Palace Museum Fire Protection Facilities Plan,' it falls far short and cannot meet the fire protection needs of the Palace Museum."

It is understood that during the six-year process of implementing the "Palace Museum Fire Protection Facilities Plan," there have been differing opinions between some engineering personnel of the Palace Museum and experts from the public security fire supervision and research design departments regarding guiding ideology and technical routes. Experts believe that disagreements should be resolved and a unified understanding should be reached to expedite the implementation of the Palace Museum's fire protection project. Given that the project has not yet started and the substantial special funds have been idle for a long time, experts urge that a leading group for the Palace Museum's safety project be established as soon as possible to change the current situation of delay and to get the Palace Museum's fire protection project out of its current dilemma.

Negligent Prevention: Frequent Thefts

The Palace Museum houses nearly 1 million cultural relics, accounting for 1/7 of the national collection. In recent years, many criminals have coveted the treasures in the Palace Museum, and evil hands have reached into the exhibition halls. The following are just a few examples:

August 10, 1985: Wang Qunyi, a 19-year-old man, carried tools to steal the golden tree on the "Group of Immortals Blessing Tower" made of ivory in the Art Gallery of the Ages. He was caught before he could act.

June 24, 1987: Han Jilin, a 22-year-old man, hid in the Xianxing Hall of the Treasure Hall after closing time, attempting to steal gold seals and gold books. He was caught.

July 7, 1988: Xiang Desheng, a 20-year-old man, hid in a dark corner of the Treasure Hall during the cleaning process, intending to steal golden swords and precious daggers. He was caught.

In 1988, the Palace Museum experienced several more theft incidents.

These criminals coveted national treasures and dared to test the law, of course, they could not escape the severe punishment of the law. However, subsequent analysis found that these criminals had all taken advantage of the Palace Museum's large area and many secluded places, hiding first and then waiting for the opportunity to act after closing. Even several criminals consecutively hid in the same place. The Beijing Municipal Procuratorate Branch, after reviewing the theft cases of Han Jilin and Xiang Desheng, believed that the frequent theft incidents in the Palace Museum were closely related to the fact that relevant staff did not clean the area thoroughly. On July 27, 1987, the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate Branch sent a letter to the Palace Museum, pointing out that the Palace Museum's "technical facilities for prevention are not yet complete and advanced, lack concealment, and after the alarm, the on-duty personnel cannot arrive at the scene in time, which is easy to miss the opportunity and is not conducive to timely capture of criminals and reduction of losses."

In October 1987, a joint investigation team from the Ministry of Public Security and the Ministry of Culture, after a comprehensive inspection, found that the Palace Museum had 164 large and small hidden dangers.

A public security safety technology expert believed that the frequent thefts in the Palace Museum were mainly due to the fact that the Palace Museum had not yet established a complete set of safety technology facilities for prevention, there were loopholes in management, security forces were weak, and prevention was neglected, giving criminals opportunities. This expert pointed out that prevention and management must be effectively combined.

Cultural Relics Damage: Shocking

In recent years, the number of visitors to the Palace Museum has increased by 10% each year. In 1987, it reached 12 million, and in 1988, it continued to increase (starting this year, the Palace Museum has taken restrictive opening measures). The large number of visitors has brought serious damage to the Palace Museum. However, what is the situation in the areas that have not been opened to the public?

For many years, a large number of precious cultural relics have been stored in warehouses without safety guarantees or ventilation facilities, neither can they play a social role, nor can they be protected from mold and moisture. Some unopened courtyards are almost neglected, with dust everywhere, cobwebs in the courtyard, rats roaming freely, and some cultural relics and paintings losing their value.

The damage to cultural relics by some Palace Museum staff is also shocking. On September 11, 1988, a custodian from the Palace Museum's Open Management Department entered the Yongshou Palace courtyard. At that time, the Exhibition Department was setting up the "Exhibition of the Last Emperor's Life in the Palace," and he saw the "Joyful Sedan" (a second-class historical relic, the only one of its kind) used by the empress during her wedding in the exhibition hall. He stepped over the sedan pole, entered the sedan, and smashed the glass with the "Joy" character on the seat. On October 8, 1988, two new employees from the Open Management Department left their posts without permission, climbed onto the throne in the Hall of Supreme Harmony, took photos, and knocked off the wooden carvings on the south side of the throne platform. The carvings fell to the ground and broke into 7 pieces.

For the above two incidents, the Palace Museum only fined the involved parties three months' salary.

Additionally, the exquisite dragon stone pillars in the Imperial Garden were broken; precious ancient paintings were torn; ceramic treasures were smashed; the four large bronze vats in front of the Hall of Supreme Harmony were covered in scratches; many courtyard doors had severe nail loss (it is said that the latter two were caused by visitors).

During the filming of some movies and television shows, cultural relics were also frequently damaged. The Palace Museum's national treasure, a 16.57-meter-long stone carving filled with auspicious clouds and dragons, was damaged in multiple places when a television station was filming, and a large iron block rolled over it.

At the same time, increasingly severe weathering and air pollution are also causing serious natural damage to the Palace Museum. The 3,428-meter-long city wall of the Palace Museum has many places severely weathered, and in August 1988, 64 meters of the wall collapsed. Many of the carvings on the stones have become blurred, the patterns on the landscapes have cracked and peeled off, the dragon heads have turned into "radish heads," and some have even become unrecognizable. Cultural relic protection experts have warned that if advanced technology is not used for protection, 100 years from now, many ancient buildings and precious cultural relics in the Palace Museum will lose their value.

The Palace Museum is a national treasure. The main task entrusted to the Palace Museum by the state is to protect, manage, and utilize the Palace Museum well, with protection being the top priority. Some problems exist for complex reasons. For example, the problem of "destructive opening" is currently being addressed with effective measures; the problem of natural weathering is a topic of research both domestically and internationally and is currently unsolvable. However, other problems can be solved through strengthening the management mechanism, which is precisely what people expect from the Palace Museum.

　　故宫忧患录
    本报记者  傅钉根
    去年１０月，故宫博物院保卫人员赵占峰来本报反映，故宫博物院在防火、防盗和文物保护等方面都存在一些亟需解决的问题。记者根据他反映的情况，对这些问题进行了调查。
    　　　　火险隐患　接连出现
    故宫，原名紫禁城，是明清两朝的皇宫，也是我国现存最大、最完整的古建筑群。故宫所辖７２万平方米面积内，有９０多个宫院，现存房屋８７００多间，建筑面积达１５万平方米。北区内廷的建筑布局十分密集，屋宇林立，毗连成片；南区外朝的许多主殿建于高阶台基或城楼上。这些木质结构的古建筑，一旦着火，施救困难。
    近几年来，故宫火险隐患接连出现。废纸炉引燃着火；房檐下的电铃烧红；电线烧焦；宫内华贵的地毯被照明灯烤糊；宫殿内电闸几次喷火烧坏，等等。今年春节前，故宫博物院办公室主任不经申报批准，擅自让某电视台进行室内用电拍电视片。在午门燕翅楼，１９８５年文物总店存放着用易燃物制作的文物筐１８００多个，到今年３月，又增加到近１．４万个。尤为严重的是，１９８７年８月２４日夜，景阳宫遭雷击起火，烧毁屋顶面积８０多平方米，南侧屋檐中部烧焦塌陷，西南角塌落，造成重大损失。
    景阳宫火灾，暴露了故宫消防安全中的许多问题。如故宫没有火灾报警装置和现代化的救火手段，等等。
    　　　　消防工程　一拖再拖
    中央和国务院一直高度重视故宫的安全问题。中央领导同志在视察故宫时指出，必须把防火安全问题放在首要位置。早在１９８６年６月，国务院就批准拨出２００８万元专款用于实施《故宫消防设施规划》（这个规划１９８３年由公安部组织全国著名消防专家，经过大量调研工作制订完成）。国务院领导同志在批示中明确指出：“故宫的消防工程不能再拖，从今年起，抓紧施工，以防发生问题。”
    公安部第一研究所受故宫博物院委托，历时近一年，投资１０万元，广泛听取各方面专家的意见，依据《故宫消防设施规划》的原则要求，于１９８８年４月制订了在故宫分期实施的总体方案。有关专家认为，这个方案对故宫各个安全技术系统都提出了具体的要求和实施办法，尤其是在使《故宫消防设施规划》全面实施方面，取得了难能可贵的进展。同时，还得到了古建筑专家和消防监督部门的赞同。
    故宫博物院对这个总体方案没有组织论证，没有送审。他们按照自己的想法，委托另一家设计单位，搞出一个《故宫消防供水管网系统设计方案》。
    这个设计方案在１９８８年１１月召开的有关上级和消防监督部门专家参加的审查会上未被通过。北京市消防局消基审发字（１９８８）４３２号函指出：“故宫的消防给水系统是整个消防系统的一部分，同火灾报警、消防控制等系统密切相关。在总体设计未作出的情况下，只讨论消防给水系统的泵房和室外管网的布置，不符合系统设计的要求。”“本次讨论的消防给水方案是不完整的。它同已经国务院批准的《故宫消防设施规划》中的供水消防系统相比较距离甚远。不能满足故宫消防安全的需要。”
    据了解，在落实《故宫消防设施规划》长达６年的过程中，故宫少数工程负责人与公安消防监督和研究设计部门的专家在指导思想和技术路线方面持不同意见。有关专家认为，应当解决分歧，统一认识，抓紧落实故宫消防工程。鉴于工程迄今不能动工，巨额专款长期闲置，有关专家呼吁，必须尽快成立故宫安全工程领导小组，改变目前的拖延状况，使故宫消防工程摆脱进退维谷的局面。
    　　　　疏于防范　盗情频繁
    故宫收藏文物近１００万件，占全国馆藏文物的１／７。近几年来，许多不法之徒觊觎着故宫里的珍宝，一双双罪恶的黑手伸进了殿堂展柜。以下只是其中几个镜头：
    １９８５年８月１０日：王群益，男，１９岁，携带作案工具，准备盗取历代艺术馆内的象牙雕“群仙祝寿塔”上的金树，未及动手被抓获。
    １９８７年６月２４日：韩吉林，男，２２岁，待闭馆后，潜入珍宝馆养性殿内，企图盗窃金印、金册，被抓获。
    １９８８年７月７日：向德强，男，２０岁，清场时藏在珍宝馆一暗角处，欲盗金剑宝刀，被抓获。
    １９８８年，故宫又发生几起盗情。
    这些犯罪分子觊觎国家珍宝，胆敢以身试法，当然逃脱不了法律的严厉制裁。但事后分析发现，这些犯罪分子在作案前均是利用故宫面积大，偏僻地点多，先潜伏下来，待闭馆后再伺机作案的。甚至几个犯罪分子先后在同一个地点潜伏藏身。北京市人民检察院分院在审理韩吉林、向德强两起盗窃案后认为，故宫屡屡发生偷盗事件，这与有关工作人员清场不干净有密切关系。１９８７年７月２７日，北京市人民检察院分院致函故宫博物院，指出故宫博物院“用于防范的技术设施尚不够完备和先进，隐蔽性不强，报警后值班人员也不能及时赶到现场，易贻误战机，不利于及时抓获罪犯，减少损失”。
    １９８７年１０月，公安部、文化部联合调查组经过全面检查，竟发现故宫各类大小隐患多达１６４处。
    公安部一位安全技术专家认为，故宫盗情频繁，主要是故宫至今没有建立起一套完善的用于防范的安全技术设施，管理工作中存在漏洞，保卫力量薄弱，疏于防范，给犯罪分子以可乘之机。这位专家指出，必须把防范和管理有效地结合起来。
    　　　　文物损坏触目惊心
    近几年来，到故宫游览的人数每年以１０％的速度递增。１９８７年达到１２００万人次，１９８８年更是有增无减（今年开始，故宫采取了限制性开放的措施）。大量的游人给故宫带来了严重的破坏。然而，故宫开放面积只有３３万平方米，没有开放的地方，情况又如何呢？
    多年来，大批珍贵文物放在无安全保障、无防潮通风设施的库房里，既不能发挥社会价值，又长年受到霉潮腐蚀。有的没开放的宫院，几乎无人过问，里面尘埃遍地，蛛网满院，老鼠畅行无阻，一些文物、字画失去价值。
    故宫少数工作人员损坏文物的情况，也是触目惊心的。１９８８年９月１１日，故宫博物院开放管理部一位保管员来到永寿宫院内。当时，陈列部正在布置“末代皇帝在宫内生活展览”，他看到展室内摆放着皇后结婚时用的“喜轿”（二级历史文物，唯此一乘），便跨过轿杆，进入轿内，将轿座上的“喜”字玻璃压碎。１９８８年１０月８日，开放管理部两位新来职工擅离岗位，登上太和殿宝座，照像玩耍，碰掉宝座平台南侧的木雕望柱头。木雕掉在地上摔成７块。
    对以上两例，故宫博物院仅罚扣当事人３个月奖金。
    另外，御花园里精致的雕龙石柱被撞断；贵重古画遭撕裂；陶瓷珍品被打碎；太和殿前四大铜缸残环遍痕；不少宫院的大门钉丢失严重（据说后二者是游人所为）。
    在一些电影、电视摄制组拍片过程中，也屡屡发生损坏文物的情况。故宫特大国宝，１６．５７米长的布满祥云飞龙的巨大石雕，就是一家电视台在拍摄过程中，一个大铁墩滚落，从上碾过，这件国宝遭到多处损坏。
    同时，日益严重的风化和大气污染等因素，也使故宫遭到严重自然毁损。周长３４２８米的故宫城墙，许多地方风化严重，１９８８年８月，城墙坍塌６４米。不少雕石上的花纹变得模糊不清，景观的图案开裂剥落，龙头变成“萝卜头”，甚至面目全非。文物保护专家们警告说，如不采取先进技术进行保护，１００年后，故宫许多古建筑和珍贵文物将失去价值。
    故宫，国之瑰宝。国家交给故宫博物院的主要任务是要把故宫保护好、管理好、利用好，而保护是第一位的。有些问题的存在，原因比较复杂。像“破坏性开放”造成的问题，现正在采取有力措施，谋求解决；自然风化问题，是国内外正在研究的课题，目前尚解决不了。不过，另外有些问题，通过强化管理机制是能够得以解决的，这正是人们对故宫博物院的要求。
