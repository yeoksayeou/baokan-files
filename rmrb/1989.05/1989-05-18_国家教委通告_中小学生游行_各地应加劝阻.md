Middle and Primary School Students Parading: Local Authorities Should Deter Them

People's Daily, Beijing, May 18th

Yesterday, middle and primary school students were seen in the parading crowds in Beijing and other cities. This will make it more difficult to maintain public order in the cities and will not benefit the students. To protect the healthy growth, safety, and physical health of children and adolescents, the State Education Commission requires local education administrative departments and middle and primary school staff and teachers to take a highly responsible attitude towards the country and the students. They should stay at their posts, maintain normal teaching order, and deter a small number of students from going out to parade. The commission also requests that parents cooperate with the schools in this effort.

    中小学生游行  各地应加劝阻
    本报北京５月１８日讯  国家教育委员会通告
    昨天以来，在北京等城市的游行队伍中，出现了一些中小学生。这容易给维护城市的公共秩序带来更多的困难，对中小学生也没有什么好处。为保护儿童少年的健康成长、安全和身体健康，国家教委要求各地教育行政部门和中小学校的干部教师，要以对国家对学生高度负责的精神，坚守岗位，坚持正常的教学秩序，对少数学生上街游行要加以劝阻，并请学生家长配合学校做好工作。
