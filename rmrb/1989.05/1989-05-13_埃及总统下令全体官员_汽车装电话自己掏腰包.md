Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 13th.

Whoever wants to install a telephone in their car must pay for it themselves. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak issued an order yesterday to remove all telephones from the official cars of senior government officials, aiming to curb extravagant and corrupt practices.

This presidential decree applies to all officials. From the Prime Minister and cabinet members down to the general managers of state-owned enterprises, none are allowed to use public funds to install telephones in their cars, thereby saving the government a significant amount of money.
