The State Council today issued an emergency notice to firmly halt students from various places from forcing their way to Beijing by train.

The notice states that since May 16, students from some cities and regions have stormed train stations and forced their way onto trains to Beijing. Some have even lain on the tracks to block trains, severely disrupting the normal operation of railway transportation. This has not only caused significant losses to the national economy but also, with large numbers of out-of-town students flooding into Beijing, it is not conducive to stabilizing the situation in the capital and stopping the turmoil. It is also not conducive to the early resumption of classes in institutions of higher learning. Currently, most of the students in Tiananmen Square are from out of town. After arriving in Beijing, they face difficulties in eating and living. In addition, the sanitary conditions in Tiananmen Square have been poor and the environment is bad in recent days, making it possible at any time for large-scale infectious diseases to break out, which is extremely detrimental to the health of the students who have come to Beijing. To quickly stop this abnormal situation and maintain the normal order of transportation, the notice requires:

1. The main responsible comrades of local people's governments and public security departments (bureaus) and railway bureaus must personally go to the scene, organize forces, and take effective measures to firmly dissuade students from forcing their way to Beijing by train. The heads of colleges and universities, as well as the Communist Youth League and student union organizations, must do a good job of working with students on campus and persuade them not to come to Beijing.

2. All railway staff must stay at their posts, strictly enforce ticket checking and verification procedures, and insist on ticketed entry and boarding. In large and medium-sized cities with many institutions of higher learning, public security organs and armed police forces should dispatch appropriate police forces to assist in maintaining order at the stations.

3. For those who board trains without tickets, storm train stations, intercept trains, or lie on the tracks to block the way, if persuasion fails, immediate coercive measures must be taken. The ringleaders and key figures must be dealt with according to law as soon as possible, and the incidents must be reported publicly in a timely manner to clarify the situation.

4. All public security police, armed police personnel, and railway staff participating in this work must strictly act according to law.

The notice requires that all levels of people's governments and public security departments (bureaus) and railway bureaus immediately take measures to seriously implement and execute this.

　　国务院发出紧急通知
    制止各地学生强行乘车进京
    新华社北京５月２５日电  国务院今天发出关于坚决制止各地学生冲击铁路、强行乘车进京的紧急通知。
    通知说，５月１６日以来，一些城市和地区的学生冲击车站、强行乘车进京，有的甚至卧轨拦车，严重干扰了铁路运输的正常进行，不仅给国民经济造成了重大损失，而且大批外地学生涌进北京，不利于首都制止动乱和局势的稳定，也不利于各高等院校尽快复课。现在，在天安门广场的学生多数是外地来京的，他们来京后吃、住都很困难，再加上近日天安门广场卫生条件很差、环境恶劣，随时有可能爆发大规模的流行性疾病，对来京同学身体健康极为不利。为了尽快制止这种不正常状况，维护交通运输的正常秩序，通知要求：
    一、各地人民政府及公安厅（局）、铁路局的主要负责同志，要亲自到现场，组织力量，采取切实有力的措施，坚决劝阻强行乘车来京的学生。各大专院校负责人以及共青团和学生会组织要认真做好在校学生的工作，劝说他们不要来京。
    二、全体铁路干部、职工要坚守岗位，严格执行检票、验票制度，坚持凭票进站，凭票乘车，不准无票人员上车。高等院校较多的大中城市，公安机关和武警部队要派出适当警力，进站协助维持秩序。
    三、对无票强行乘车、冲击车站、拦截列车、卧轨断道等违法行为，在劝阻无效时，要迅速采取强制措施，对为首骨干分子要尽快依法处理，并及时予以公开报道，以正视听。
    四、凡参加这项工作的公安干警、武警指战员和铁路干部职工，都要严格依法办事。
    通知要求各级人民政府及各公安厅（局）、铁路局要立即采取措施，认真贯彻执行。
