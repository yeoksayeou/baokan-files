In 1988, the "wind of social obligations" swept away 10 billion yuan from the residents of cities across Shandong Province! Data provided by the Shandong Provincial Urban Socio-Economic Survey Team indicates that last year, Shandong urban residents spent an average of 40.85 yuan on social obligations. Calculating for the province's 25 million urban residents, the total expenditure amounted to 10.2 billion yuan. Faced with the increasingly strong "wind of social obligations," people have expressed their lament with the words, "How much sorrow can one bear? The burden of social obligations weighs heavy as an ox."

Currently, the customs of hosting banquets and giving gifts are becoming increasingly varied and numerous. In the past, friends and relatives would only express their good wishes during weddings, funerals, and other significant life events. Now, new occasions for giving gifts can be listed in a long series: job transfers, promotions, joining the Party or the Youth League, entering school, changing jobs, opening a business, moving to a new home, celebrating the birth of a child, and a daughter's birthday, among others. Additionally, some people, in order to achieve certain goals, do not hesitate to spend large sums of money to build relationships, find connections, and smooth the way.

As the occasions for giving gifts increase, the standards for gifts also rise. In the past, contributing to a wedding with 10 or 8 yuan was considered generous. Now, without two "big notes" (100 yuan bills), one cannot present a gift with dignity.

Hosting banquets and giving gifts have increased the economic burden on families. Statistics show that in Shandong Province, about 6% of urban residents have an average annual income of only 629.19 yuan, which is barely enough to cover basic living expenses. However, even these impoverished households spent an average of 27.86 yuan on gifts last year.

　　问君能有几多愁　人情负担重如牛    
    山东城市居民去年送礼金额高达十个亿
    本报讯  １９８８年山东全省城市居民被“人情风”刮去了１０个亿！由山东省城市社会经济调查队提供的资料表明，去年山东城市居民用于人情方面的开支人均４０．８５元，按全省２５００万城市居民计算，总支出为１０．２亿元。面对愈刮愈烈的“人情风”，人们发出了“问君能有几多愁，人情负担重如牛”的感叹。
    眼下，请客送礼的名堂五花八门，越来越多。过去亲友之间仅在遇到婚丧嫁娶时表示一下“意思”，现在新增项目可以列出一大串：工作调动，职务变更，入党入团，升学转干，开市大吉，乔迁之喜，喜添贵子，娇女生日等等。还有一些人为了办成某种事情，不惜以重金拉关系，找门子，打通关节。
    随着送礼名目的增多，送礼的标准也越来越高。过去凑结婚的份子，１０元８元已经很大方了，现在没有两张“大团结”是拿不出手的。
    请客送礼加重了居民家庭的经济负担。据统计，山东省城市居民中６％左右的人家人均年生活费仅有６２９．１９元，但就是这些连基本生活都难以保证的贫困户，去年人均赠送支出也达２７．８６元。
