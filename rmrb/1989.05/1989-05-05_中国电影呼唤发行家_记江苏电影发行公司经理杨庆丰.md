Before "The Evening Bell" won the Silver Bear Award at the West Berlin Film Festival, only one copy had been distributed domestically. The sole purchaser of this copy piqued my interest. I thought, he certainly didn't have the foresight to predict the film's success, nor did he expect it to be a box office hit. Why did he dare to act alone?

Thus, I specially visited Yang Qingfeng, the manager of Jiangsu Provincial Film Distribution and Exhibition Company. He is quite young, everyone calls him Little Yang. He has an honest and kind appearance, making one wonder if he has enough courage to lead the over 20,000-person distribution and exhibition team across the province. My concerns later turned into respect, as it turns out Jiangsu has such a bold, business-savvy, and exemplary film distributor.

"Ordering distinctive exploratory films is our company's consistent policy. 'Horse Thief' sold only 7 copies nationwide, 'The Great Parade' only 6, but we bought both. Of course, we incurred losses. 'The Great Parade' earned only 600 yuan in provincial distribution revenue. It doesn't matter; I never expected to make a profit."

Yang Qingfeng believes that films face audiences with different cultural levels, aesthetic tastes, and consumption psychology. As the sole operator of the film market, the film distribution company should at least have a diversified business perspective and a long-term business vision. The film market is like a department store; the shelves should have all kinds of goods for you to choose from. You can't refuse to buy copies or screen films just because most audiences don't understand or like them, depriving a minority of viewers of their right to watch.

We often habitually add the phrase "broad masses of" before "audience." In the past, this indicated a political stance; today, it also includes actual economic interests. Thus, slogans like "the audience is God" and "the audience is our breadwinner" are shouted loudly. In reality, respecting quantity and box office revenue does not necessarily mean truly respecting the audience. If you constantly pander and indulge, it somewhat deceives the audience. Yang Qingfeng said, "We are not trying every means to take money from the audience's pockets, but rather trying every means to provide various types of films to meet the audience's diverse needs."

Distributing films, of course, should make money, but the key is how to make money? Yang Qingfeng said, any businessman cannot make a profit on every deal; there must be gains and losses. Only making profits and no losses is a short-term business behavior. Film distribution cannot focus solely on one film at a time; it needs a long-term vision. For example, martial arts and thriller films make money. If your cinema keeps screening them, you will inevitably exclude viewers with higher cultural tastes. In the long run, they won't even pay attention to what films you are showing. Those who like martial arts and thriller films will gradually become bored. This ruins the tastes of both groups of viewers, and you end up damaging your own brand. Even from a purely business perspective, this is unwise, let alone the fact that films are a spiritual product with unavoidable social benefits and the responsibility to raise the audience's aesthetic standards.

That year, "Beach" and "Yellow Earth" were released one after the other, sparking heated debates in the film industry, while ordinary viewers felt they couldn't see much difference. With the support of the provincial television station, the Jiangsu Provincial Company invited several famous professors and film critics to discuss the films on television, with both praise and criticism, each expressing their opinions, interspersed with clips from the films. The next day, long lines formed outside cinemas in various cities across the province, and the cinemas were packed for several days. These two films made a lot of money, very beautifully and comfortably.

He also took risks. During the trial screening of "Hibiscus Town," the atmosphere was tense. After discussing with several experienced colleagues in the company, Yang Qingfeng stood firm against enormous pressure, exercising his business autonomy for the first time, ordering seven copies right away. He also bought back copies from neighboring provinces that had been returned, totaling sixteen copies. This money, however, was earned with a heavy heart, fearing a sudden stop-screening notice. When Xie Jin, Liu Xiaqing, and Jiang Wen went on stage to receive awards, where was Yang Qingfeng? He didn't receive a single word of praise.

However, Yang Qingfeng is optimistic. He took office in 1985, and in 1986, the distribution revenue reached 5016 million yuan, making it the national champion. In the following three years, the revenue increased significantly each year, maintaining the national champion position year after year.

　　中国电影呼唤发行家   
    ——记江苏电影发行公司经理杨庆丰
    张弦
    《晚钟》获西柏林电影节银熊奖之前，国内拷贝只发行了一个。这唯一拷贝的买主引起我莫大的兴趣。我想，他绝无预料此片必将获奖的先见之明，也一定知道此片上映绝不卖座。为什么他敢于一意孤行呢？
    于是，我专程走访了江苏省电影发行放映公司经理杨庆丰。他很年轻，都喊他小杨，一副老实敦厚模样，使人担心他是否有足够的魄力领导遍布全省的两万多人的发行放映队伍。我的担心后来转为敬意，原来江苏有这样一位有胆识、善经营、堪称电影发行家的人物。
    “订购有特色的探索影片，是我们公司的一贯主张。《盗马贼》全国只卖了７个拷贝，《大阅兵》只卖了６个，我们都买了。当然，都赔了钱。《大阅兵》全省发行收入只有６００元。这没什么，我根本没指望赚钱。”
    杨庆丰认为，电影面对的是不同文化层次、不同审美趣味和不同消费心理的观众。电影发行公司作为电影市场的独家经营者，起码应该具有多样化的经营观点和长远的经营眼光。电影市场好比百货公司，货柜上应当什么货都有，任你挑选。不能因为多数观众看不懂、不爱看，就不买拷贝，不上映，剥夺了少数观众的看片权。
    我们往往习惯地在观众前面加上“广大的”这个定语。过去，这表明一种政治态度；而今又包含着实际的经济利益。于是“观众是上帝”、“观众是我们衣食父母”之类的口号便喊得震天价响。其实，对数量的尊重，对票房的尊重，未必是真正尊重观众。如果一味迎合、迁就，反而多少有点愚弄的意味。杨庆丰说：“我们不是千方百计去掏观众口袋里的钱，而是千方百计提供各种类型的影片，满足观众多样化的需求。”
    发行影片当然要赚钱，但重要的是钱怎么赚？杨庆丰说，任何商人都不能每笔生意都赚，总得有赚有赔。光赚不赔，是经营上的短期行为。影片发行不能只盯着一时一片，要有长远眼光。比如武打片、惊险片赚钱，你电影院一个劲儿放映，势必将文化层次较高的观众拒之门外，久而久之，他们就根本不注意你放什么影片了。而那些喜欢看武打、惊险片的观众也渐渐会厌倦起来。这就败坏了两方面观众的胃口，自己把自己的牌子砸了。即使从单纯经营的角度来看也是不明智的，更何况电影是一种精神的产品，有其不可忽视的社会效益和提高观众审美水准的责任呢？
    那年《海滩》、《黄土地》相继出台，影坛争论激烈，而普通观众却反映看不出什么名堂来。江苏省公司在省电视台的支持下，请了几位知名教授、影评家，在电视屏幕上展开评议，有贬有褒，各抒己见，并穿插以影片的画面。第二天，全省各城市影院门前都排起了长龙，连日爆满。这两笔钱赚得很光采，很舒心。
    他也有担风险的时候。《芙蓉镇》试映时风声正紧，杨庆丰与公司内几位有经验的老同志一起商量后，顶住巨大压力，发挥了一次经营自主权，第一次就订下了七个拷贝，又转买下邻省退掉的拷贝，先后共买了十六个。这笔钱，他却赚得心中忐忑，只怕突然来个停映通知。当谢晋、刘晓庆、姜文登台领奖的时候，杨庆丰呢？没有得到半个字的夸赞。
    然而杨庆丰是乐观的。他１９８５年上任，１９８６年发行收入就以５０１６万，跃为全国之冠。此后一连三年，年年大幅度增长，年年保持全国冠军。
