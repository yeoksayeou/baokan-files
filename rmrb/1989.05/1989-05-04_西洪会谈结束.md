	West-Hun Talks Conclude

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Jakarta on May 3 (reporter Li Yongming), the two-day talks on the Cambodian issue, held by Prince Sihanouk, Chairman of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, Khmer People's National Liberation Front Prime Minister Son Sann, and Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime, concluded this afternoon. Both sides reached a consensus on two issues: (1) Both sides agreed that the United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar and Indonesian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Jakarta Informal Meeting on the Cambodian Issue Ali Alatas will decide on the holding of an international conference on the Cambodian issue and the establishment of an "International Supervisory Body." (2) Both sides agreed that on the "internal factors" related to the Cambodian issue, both sides hold different views.

	The so-called "internal factors" include the establishment of a four-party interim joint government to prepare for and organize national elections, etc.
