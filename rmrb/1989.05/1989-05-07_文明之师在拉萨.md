In the midst of blossoming peach trees, green willows, and blooming flowers, the reporters arrived in the ancient city of Lhasa on the plateau. They saw monks and nuns walking the streets, turning prayer wheels, and the various temples and religious activity sites filled with incense smoke and fluttering prayer flags. Pilgrims came and went in an endless stream. Government offices, schools, and shops were operating normally. The farmers' market was bustling with vendors' cries, and all kinds of fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat were available. The once-troubled Barkhor Street was crowded with tourists, laughter, and joy, making it a lively scene.

Among this bustling scene, a large horizontal banner on the street caught the reporters' attention. It read in bold letters, "Love Lhasa, Love the Tibetan People." This banner was hung by the soldiers of a certain "Model Unit for Mass Work" who were carrying out martial law duties in the city.

The "Model Unit for Mass Work" and its sister units are the same troops that fought in the liberation of Tibet and the suppression of rebellions, earning them a reputation for their benevolence and civilization. For decades, the Tibetan people have called them the "Righteous and Civilized Troops."

In concrete terms, the various martial law units have faithfully protected the lives and property of the people. On April 3rd at noon, a 17-year-old girl named Zhou, who was upset because she did not get into college or join the army, ran to the Lhasa River to take her own life. The platoon leader Zhang Huayu, who was on duty at the Monument Square, discovered her and rushed to the river with soldiers Zhang Tianxiang and Wang Shiyou. They saw the girl, with her eyes tightly closed, walking towards the turbulent river. Zhang, the platoon leader, rushed into the water and pulled the girl back to the shore. Later, the girl's mother, with tears in her eyes, bowed to Zhang Huayu in gratitude.

On the evening of April 11th, just after eleven o'clock, a coffee shop in the commercial department of the Tibet Autonomous Region Development Bureau's Mining Company caught fire, and thick smoke billowed out. The platoon leader Luo Yang of a certain unit, who was on duty nearby, left some soldiers to continue their duties and sent the deputy squad leader Huang Changsheng to report the fire to the fire department. He then rushed back to the unit to organize troops to put out the fire. Luo, the platoon leader, disregarding the flames, quickly removed the door panels and opened the fire extinguishing path. The soldiers either splashed water or used brooms and tree branches to beat out the fire. The fire department arrived in time, and together they extinguished the blaze.

Located at the foot of the Potala Palace, the Labor People's Cultural Palace in Lhasa is a popular spot for locals and tourists to visit and take photos. Unfortunately, two artificial lakes of nearly a thousand square meters each have not been cleaned for over a decade. The lakes were filled with debris and silt, and the shores were piled with garbage, dampening the enthusiasm of visitors.

After the leadership of the "Model Unit for Mass Work" discovered this problem, the political commissar Xu Jintai led the soldiers to the lakeside to "beautify" the artificial lakes. The officers and soldiers broke the ice and dug out the silt, removing over sixty tons of garbage, making the two lakes clear as mirrors and restoring the reflection of the Potala Palace. The soldiers of the second battalion, who were on duty in the Barkhor Street area, would get up before dawn every morning to clean the Jokhang Temple Square and Barkhor Street thoroughly before the Tibetan people set up their stalls and shops.

As for picking up lost items and returning them to their owners, refusing bribes, escorting Tibetan women home at night, helping lost children find their way home, and assisting shops damaged by rioters to resume business, these are common occurrences in the martial law units.

When it comes to martial law, reporters had a sense of mystery before entering Tibet. However, upon arriving in Lhasa, they could not feel any difference from other cities.

At a checkpoint, we saw a woman dressed in Tibetan clothing riding a bicycle approaching. She stopped in front of the on-duty soldier and waved at him. The soldier smiled and nodded at her, and she then rode away, humming a popular song. At an entrance to the martial law area in a certain western pass, the reporter saw a large truck approaching. The on-duty soldier raised a red flag, and the truck stopped. The soldier stood at attention and saluted, then smiled and said, "Sorry, please show your ID!" After checking the ID, the soldier waved a green flag and said, "Please proceed!"

The soldiers are the guardians of the people and the "nemesis" of lawbreakers. A few individuals who attempted to smuggle weapons and other lawbreakers were unable to slip past the vigilant on-duty soldiers.

### 文明之师在拉萨

　　文明之师在拉萨
    本报记者  罗同松  中央人民广播电台记者  岳林才
    　　　　（一）
    在桃红柳绿、鲜花竞开的大好春光里，记者来到高原古城拉萨。只见朝圣转经的僧尼漫步街头，各寺庙以及宗教活动点香烟缭绕、经幡飞扬，朝佛群众络绎不绝；机关、学校一切正常，商店顾客盈门，农贸市场上叫卖声不断，各种鲜菜、瓜果和肉类食品应有尽有，曾发生过骚乱的八廓街上，游人摩肩接踵，欢声笑语，热闹非凡。
    在这一派繁荣景象中，当街一条大横幅吸引了记者，上书“热爱拉萨，热爱藏胞”八个醒目大字。这是在市内执行戒严任务的某部“群众工作模范团”的官兵们悬挂的。
    “群众工作模范团”和它的兄弟部队，都是当年进军西藏和在平叛作战中立下汗马功劳，并具有爱民优良传统的部队。几十年来，藏胞一直称他们为“仁义之师、文明之师”。
    　　　　（二）
    “热爱拉萨，热爱藏胞”，具体体现在各戒严部队忠实地保护人民的生命财产安全上。四月三日中午，一个十七岁的小周姑娘因升学和参军未能如愿，一气之下，便跑到拉萨河寻短见。正在纪念碑路口执勤的连长张华玉发现后，带着战士张天祥、王世友飞步跑到河边，只见紧闭双眼的姑娘正向浪花翻滚的河心走去。张连长冲到水中，将姑娘拖回岸上。事后，姑娘的母亲眼含热泪向张连长作揖致谢。
    四月十一日晚十一点刚过，西藏自治区开发局矿业公司商业门市部的咖啡店不慎失火，浓烟滚滚。正在附近哨位执勤的某部排长罗阳发，一面留下士兵继续执勤，一面派副班长黄长生向消防队报警，自己跑回连队组织兵力前去救火。罗排长不顾火焰烧身，抢先卸去门板，打开灭火通路，战士们有的泼水，有的用扫把、树枝扑打。消防队及时赶来，共同扑灭了大火。
    　　　　（三）
    地处布达拉宫脚下的拉萨市劳动人民文化宫，是市民们游玩和外地游客摄影留念的好去处。可惜两个近千平方米的人工湖自建成十多年来未曾清理，湖中尽是杂物、淤泥，岸上垃圾成堆，使人游兴大减。
    “群众工作模范团”的领导发现这个问题后，团政委许金太带领官兵们来到湖边给人工湖“美容”。干部战士破寒冰、挖淤泥，共清除垃圾六十多吨，使两个人工湖水清如镜，重现了布达拉宫的倒影。在八廓街一带执勤的二营官兵，每天早晨天不亮就起床，赶在藏族同胞摆摊设点经商之前，将大昭寺广场和八廓街打扫得干干净净。
    至于拾金不昧、拒收贿赂，夜送下班藏族妇女、帮助迷路儿童找家，以及帮助被骚乱分子砸坏的商店恢复营业之类的事情，在戒严部队更是比比皆是。
    　　　　（四）
    说到戒严，记者在进藏之前总有一种神秘感。到了拉萨，却怎么也感觉不出与别的城市有什么不同。
    在一个路口的哨位上，我们见一位穿着藏族服装的妇女乘自行车驶来，到哨位前自动停下车，向执勤战士招了招手，执勤战士微笑着向她点了点头，她便跨上车，哼着流行歌曲走了。在进入戒严区的西部某要道口，记者见到一辆大卡车驶来，执勤战士举起了红旗，卡车便停下了。执勤战士“叭——”地立正敬礼，然后笑容可掬地说道：“对不起，请出示证件！”查验完证件后，执勤战士将绿旗一挥：“请通过！”
    战士是人民的卫士，也是不法之徒的“克星”。有极少数图谋不轨的私带武器者和其他一些不法分子，却没能从警惕的执勤战士手中溜掉。
