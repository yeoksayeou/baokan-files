The crystal art piece "Suzhou Lantern Boat" newly displayed in front of the Folk Customs Hall of the Suzhou Folk Customs Museum vividly showcases the traditional scene of touring Suzhou by lantern boat. The piece, with its ingenious design and lively shapes, has received widespread praise from both domestic and international tourists.

The artwork is 200 centimeters long, 50 centimeters wide, and 60 centimeters high, and it sparkles brilliantly. The interior of the boat is exquisitely decorated with nearly a hundred colorful lanterns. When lit at dusk, they shine brightly in various colors, creating a dazzling spectacle. Inside the boat and on the deck, there are 50 clay figurines, some singing and dancing, some sightseeing, some enjoying "boat cuisine," and others reciting poetry or painting, all lifelike and full of charm.

The tradition of touring Suzhou by lantern boat was particularly popular during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty. According to historical records, "Every year in mid-April, lantern frames are set up, known as 'trying the lanterns.' Passing through the Wood Azalea Market is called 'dropping the lanterns.' During this time, the ancient city of Suzhou, with its crisscrossing waterways, is adorned with decorated boats and lanterns, and tourists enjoy the scenery from the boats, taking in the beautiful views along the way. The works of Qing Dynasty scholar Gu Lu, such as 'Tong Bridge Leaning Oar Records' and 'Qing Jia Records,' quote ancient texts: 'Water entertainment in Wu is prosperous, and the most beautiful is the lantern boat,' 'The boat cabin is filled with treasures, and the windows are adorned with light silk,' 'The lantern boat enters the night with all lanterns lit, five-colored glass lights on the upper layer. The firelight reflects on people's faces, and even in the cool night, they wear thin Wu silk.'"

The creator of "Suzhou Lantern Boat," Cai Shude, is a retired official from Changshu City. This time, at the invitation of the Suzhou Folk Customs Museum, he reviewed a large amount of ancient books and local historical materials and created the piece using more than 200 pieces of colored glass. The clay figurines inside were specially made by Suzhou artisan Shen Renqian.

Currently, Suzhou City has restored the lantern boat tour as a unique tourist attraction. When night falls, the tour boats with colorful lanterns slowly move along the ancient Grand Canal. Tourists lean over the railings to enjoy the scenery, with moonlight and lantern light reflecting off the rippling water. The elegantly shaped ancient bridges stretch like rainbows across the two banks; the newly built Pan Gate ancient city gate stands majestically, connected to the winding city walls; laughter and chatter occasionally drift from the riverside houses. This scene is truly enchanting.

　　灯船游姑苏
    江宗荣
    新陈列在苏州民俗博物馆节俗厅前的晶体艺术品《苏州灯船》，以精巧的构思、生动的造型，展现了富有传统特色的灯船游览姑苏情景，受到中外旅游者的广泛好评。
    这件艺术品长２００厘米，宽５０厘米，高６０厘米，晶莹剔透，耀人眼目。船内装饰精美，悬设彩灯近百盏，“入暮”燃点，光耀四射，争奇竞巧，纷纶五色；船头、舱内，有５０个泥塑人像，或在歌舞弹唱，或在浏览观赏，或在品尝“船菜”，或在吟诗作画，栩栩如生，神态各异，情趣盎然。
    灯船游姑苏，以清代道光年间最为盛行。据古籍记载：“每岁四月中旬始搭灯架，名曰‘试灯’。过木樨市，谓之‘落灯’。”在这段时间里，河道纵横交织的古城苏州，画船张灯结彩，游人泛舟观光，沿途美景尽收眼底。清顾禄的《桐桥倚棹录》和《清嘉录》有引古人云：“水嬉吴下盛，绝丽推灯船”、“舫斋促坐列珍珠，入窗四拓轻褣纱”、“灯船入夜尽张灯，五色玻璃列上层。赢得火光人面映，夜凉犹著薄吴绫”。
    《苏州灯船》的作者蔡树德，是常熟市退休干部。这次，他应苏州民俗博物馆的约请，在参阅了大量古籍和地方史料后，用大小２００多块五彩玻璃制作而成。其中的泥塑人像，则由苏州艺人沈人倩专门制作。
    目前，苏州市已恢复了灯船游姑苏的特色旅游项目。每当夜幕降临，游艇彩灯闪耀，沿古运河徐徐前行。游人凭栏观赏，月光与灯光相映成辉，照在波光粼粼的河面上；造型典雅的古桥，犹如彩虹般横跨于两岸；新修建的盘门古城楼雄伟壮丽，连着蜿蜒曲折的城墙；阵阵欢声笑语，不时从沿河人家传出。此情此景，令人神往。
