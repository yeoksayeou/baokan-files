The South Korean magazine *New East Asia* published an article titled “Traffic Hell” Seoul in its third issue. The following is a summary:

The traffic problems in Seoul, often referred to as “war” and “plague,” are worsening. Seoul currently has 800,000 cars, and traffic experts predict that this number will increase to 3 million within the next ten years. These cars would be enough to cover all of Seoul’s roads.

Seoul has the highest traffic accident rate in the world. If the current trend continues, by the year 2000, each household will have one traffic accident victim per year.

In the past five years, the number of cars has increased by 1.5 times, but the number of roads has only increased by 2.32 percent. In 1988, the average speed of cars in the city dropped from 40 kilometers per hour in 1980 to 20 kilometers per hour. It is estimated that by 1996, the average speed may drop to 7 kilometers per hour, making it faster to walk than to drive.

Compared to the rapid increase in the number of cars, the increase in road capacity is too slow, only 0.2 to 0.4 percent. The road area in Seoul is 17.29 percent of the residential area, which is much lower compared to Washington’s 43 percent, New York’s 35 percent, and Tokyo’s 24.4 percent. Increasing the road area by 1 percent requires an investment of approximately 60 billion won. It will be difficult to increase the road area in the future.

When the hourly capacity of a lane exceeds 1,800 vehicles, it causes chaos and cannot operate smoothly. However, from a traffic survey conducted from 7:30 AM to 9:30 AM in 1986 at 21 locations in the city and 15 bridges over the Han River, the hourly capacity of the Namsan No. 1 Tunnel was 2,036 vehicles, the Sam-il Overpass was 1,993 vehicles, and the Donghu Bridge was 1,958 vehicles, all exceeding the saturation point.

There are 380 bus routes in the city, with about 10,000 buses carrying 50 percent of the mobile population. The remaining 50 percent is carried by approximately 50,000 taxis, 500,000 private cars, and four subway lines, each carrying about one-third.

The occupancy rate of buses reaches 150 percent, with passengers crammed together like sardines. Passengers rush to board the buses, and drivers, fearing delays, stop at unauthorized stops, causing chaos and frequent fights between drivers and passengers or among passengers.

The situation in the subway is even worse. The occupancy rate of subway passengers reaches 280 percent, with one car carrying 3,500 people per day, setting a world record. People joke that it’s not a “subway” but a “hellway.”

Due to the overcrowding in buses and subways, the number of taxis is increasing. Currently, the passenger volume of taxis is almost equal to that of the subway. Although taxi fares are higher than those of buses and subways, for short distances, a few people sharing a taxi is almost the same cost as a bus.

Another serious problem that arises with the increase in cars is the parking issue. When driving in the city, it is common to circle around looking for a parking spot.

Traffic expert Dr. Mun Dong-ju said, “From the current situation, the only way to solve the traffic problems is to have people who drive private cars switch to the subway.”

“Our Seoul” is now in dire need of rescue. She may be critically ill, and even the best doctors and remedies may be of no use. If treatment is attempted, it may cause more pain. However, Seoul is awaiting fundamental “traffic reform.”

### “交通地狱”汉城

　　“交通地狱”汉城
    南朝鲜《新东亚》杂志第三期刊登了一篇题为《“交通地狱”汉城》文章，摘要如下：
    被人们称为“战争”和“瘟疫”的汉城交通问题正在日益恶化。汉城现在有八十万辆汽车，交通问题专家预测今后十年之内将增加到三百万辆，这些汽车把所有的汉城路面覆盖起来还绰绰有余。
    汉城的交通事故率是世界最高的，如果以目前的趋势发展下去，到二○○○年，每户每年将有一名交通事故死伤者。
    最近五年间，汽车增加了一点五倍，但道路只增加了百分之二点三二。一九八八年市区汽车平均走行速度由一九八零年每小时的四十公里减少到了每小时二十公里。预计一九九六年可能降到每小时七公里。这样，坐车就不如步行了。
    与汽车增加速度相比，道路率增加太缓慢，只增加百分之零点二到百分之零点四。汉城市的道路面积为居住面积的百分之十七点二九，同华盛顿占百分之四十三、纽约占百分之三十五、东京占百分之二十四点四相比差得很多。道路率每增加百分之一，需要投资约六千亿元。今后将难以增加道路率。
    车道上的每小时容量超过一千八百辆就会引起混乱而不能运行。但从一九八六年的上班时间（从七点三十分到九点三十分）对市区二十一个地点和十五座汉江桥进行交通调查的情况来看，南山一号隧道的小时容量为二千零三十六辆，三一高架桥为一千九百九十三辆，东湖大桥为一千九百五十八辆，都超过了饱和点。
    市区有三百八十条公共汽车路线，约有一万辆公共汽车运送百分之五十的流动人口。其余百分之五十由约五万辆出租汽车、约五十万辆小轿车和四条地铁大约各运送三分之一。
    公共汽车的乘坐率达百分之一百五十，像沙丁鱼那样挤在一起。乘客争上汽车，司机又怕误时间而越站停车，这就造成了混乱，使司机同乘客或乘客同乘客经常打架。
    地铁的情况比公共汽车更糟。地铁乘客率竟达到百分之二百八十，一节车厢一天要运送三千五百多人次，创了世界冠军纪录。人们说不知道是“地铁”还是“地狱”。
    由于公共汽车和地铁拥挤，出租汽车日益增加。现在出租汽车的客运量几乎等于地铁客运量了。出租汽车的运费要比公共汽车和地铁贵，但在短距离几个人合乘就和公共汽车费差不多。
    随着汽车的增加出现的另一个严重问题是停车场问题。在市区开汽车时，因为找不到停车的地方而在街上转几圈是常事。
    交通专家文东周博士说：“从现在的情况来看，解决交通困难的唯一办法是让乘坐小轿车的人改乘地铁。”
    “我们的汉城”现在等待抢救。她也许病入膏肓，名医和妙方也无济于事了。如果动手医治，也可能使她更加痛苦。但是，汉城等待着根本的“交通改革”。
