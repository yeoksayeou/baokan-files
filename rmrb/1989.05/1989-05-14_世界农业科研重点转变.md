The current differences in agricultural production levels among various countries around the world are largely due to disparities in agricultural technology. Strengthening agricultural research is the foundation and an effective means for developing agricultural productivity.

The Application of Science and Technology

Since the mid-19th century, the application of agricultural technology worldwide has primarily focused on crop breeding, plant protection, chemical fertilizers, livestock breeding, feeding, disease prevention, and mechanization. Now, biotechnology research is also advancing, including cell and tissue culture, protoplast fusion, enhanced photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, growth regulators, and genetic engineering. These developments will further drive agricultural and pastoral industries to new heights.

Developed countries have been able to rapidly achieve modernized agriculture based on science. For example, Japan, with its limited land and abundant labor, has adopted an intensive farming approach based on crop variety improvement and chemical fertilizers. In contrast, North America, with its abundant land resources and limited labor, has adopted a farming method with lower land productivity but higher labor productivity, quickly achieving agricultural mechanization. After implementing agricultural technological innovations, they have continuously and broadly increased productivity, raised farmers' incomes, lowered agricultural product prices, and improved consumers' living standards.

Developing countries have mastered and utilized many of the basic research and application technologies from developed countries, rapidly transitioning from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture. The agricultural technological revolution in developed countries took about 200 years, while some developing countries have achieved major transformations in just a few decades. For instance, South Korea introduced production technologies from Japan in the 1930s and quickly established a modern rice production sector. India and other Asian countries have undergone a green revolution in about 20 years, rapidly developing rice and wheat production.

Facing New Challenges

In North America and Western Europe, the adoption of new technologies has led to ecological degradation, soil degradation, and environmental pollution. In developing countries, due to rapid population growth, uncontrolled land reclamation has exacerbated soil degradation. These issues have forced people to consider shifting the focus of agricultural technological research. Most developed countries are transitioning from increasing production to food safety and environmental protection. For developing countries, increasing agricultural output and productivity remains a top research priority. Additionally, they need to address issues related to food processing, storage, and comprehensive utilization.

Changes in Research Priorities

In crop cultivation: Previous research focused on exporting agricultural and pastoral products, increasing productivity, grass cultivation, irrigation, fertilizers, pesticides, and large-scale production. Current research priorities include developing high-yield, disease-resistant varieties, adopting cultivation techniques suitable for dry farming and conserving inputs, improving soil structure and fertility, intercropping, integrated pest management, and multiple cropping systems.

In animal husbandry: Previous research focused on cattle, large-scale operations, and capital-intensive production. Current priorities include small ruminants and other small livestock breeds; improving dryland pastures, sheep, goats, and their disease prevention; improving livestock feed, hybrid breeding, embryo transplantation, disease diagnosis and vaccines, growth hormones, and animal nutrition research.

In fisheries: Previous research focused on increasing production in coastal fisheries, developing fishing vessels and gear. Current priorities include coastal and inland fisheries, aquaculture (especially integrated fish farming), resource enhancement, improving catch efficiency, reducing post-harvest losses, improving monitoring of fish stocks, improving the marine environment, and using new energy sources.

In forestry: Emphasis is on researching the productivity of timber, cultivating fast-growing, multi-purpose timber crops in adverse environments, strengthening research on eucalyptus species, implementing agroforestry systems (a farming system that combines traditional agriculture with the cultivation of multi-purpose timber crops), trees beneficial for environmental improvement, and managing forest reserves.

Increasing Research Investment

Past experiences have shown that the return on investment in agricultural technological research is high, with many countries achieving annual returns exceeding 50%, and some reaching 100%. According to the International Agricultural Research Consultative Group's analysis of the production benefits of some research projects in Latin America, the annual return is at least 20-40%, and the social benefits return rate in developing countries is generally higher than in developed countries.

In the 1960s and 1970s, developing countries saw significant increases in agricultural research investment. For example, Latin America increased by 5.8 times, Asia by 6.9 times, and Africa by 3.6 times. Developed countries, with a strong agricultural research foundation, saw slower increases in investment. For instance, Canada and the United States saw their research funds increase by only 1.9 times and 2.4 times, respectively, during the same period. However, the proportion of agricultural research funds to total agricultural output remains higher in developed countries than in developing countries, with North America at 3% and Africa, Asia, and Latin America all below 1%. According to a survey report by the International Agricultural Research Consultative Group, in 1985, for every million hectares of cultivated land, 20 developing countries had fewer than 50 researchers, and 9 countries had fewer than 25 researchers. In contrast, Western European countries had 206 researchers and $15.7 million in research funds. Two technologically advanced developing countries, India and Brazil, had 14 researchers and $730,000 in research funds per million hectares of cultivated land in India, and 41 researchers and $2.44 million in research funds in Brazil. The research capabilities and conditions in developing countries also lag behind those in developed countries. Therefore, they must continue to improve agricultural research facilities and highly value the cultivation of agricultural technological talent.

　　世界农业科研重点转变
    朱丕荣
    当今，世界上不同国家农业生产水平的高低，很大程度上取决于农业科技水平的差异。加强农业科研是发展农业生产力的基础和有效的手段。
    科学技术的应用
    从１９世纪中期开始，世界农业科技的应用主要是在作物育种、植物保护、化学肥料、牲畜育种、饲养和疫病防治以及机械化等方面。现在生物技术研究又有发展，如细胞和组织培养、原生质体融合、增强光合作用，以及固氮、生长调节剂和遗传工程等，这将进一步推动农牧业向新的水平发展。
    发达国家能够较快地实现以科学为基础的现代化农业。例如日本，它的土地少，劳力多，所以采用了以作物品种改良和化肥为基础的集约化经营方式；而北美，由于土地资源丰富、劳动力少，则采用土地生产率较低而劳动生产率较高的经营方式，迅速实现了农业机械化。它们实行农业技术革新后，广泛持续地提高了生产率，农民收入增加，农产品价格相对降低，提高了消费者的生活水平。
    发展中国家掌握和利用了发达国家的多数基本研究和应用技术，使传统农业迅速向现代化农业转变。发达国家的农业技术革命经历了２００年左右的时间，而一些发展中国家仅用了几十年的时间便实现了主要转变。如南朝鲜在３０年代从日本引进了生产技术，迅速建立了一个现代化的水稻生产部门。印度和其他一些亚洲国家，在一二十年内进行了绿色革命，使水稻和小麦生产获得了迅速发展。
    面临的新挑战
    在北美和西欧一些发达国家，由于采用新技术，造成了生态恶化、土壤退化和环境污染等问题。发展中国家由于受人口增长快的压力，而乱垦土地，使地力衰退加重。这些情况迫使人们不得不考虑转变农业科技研究的工作重点。大多数发达国家正从增加生产转向食品安全和环境保护方面。发展中国家从整体来说，提高农业产量和生产率仍是一个最重要的科研重点，此外，它们还须解决食品加工、贮藏和综合利用等方面的问题。
    科研重点的变化
    种植业方面：过去的研究偏重于出口农牧业产品，以及提高生产率、草作栽培、灌溉、化肥、农药和大规模生产，等等。现在的研究重点是培育抵抗力强的高产品种、采用适应于旱作条件和节省投入物的栽培技术、改良土壤结构和提高地力、间作、病虫害综合防治、多熟制等。
    畜牧业方面：过去偏重于研究牛、大规模经营、资本集约生产等。现在的重点是小反雏动物和其他小畜禽品种；改良旱地牧草、绵羊、山羊以及它们的疾病防治问题；改善牲畜饲料，杂交育种、胚胎移植、疫病诊断和疫苗、生长激素和家畜营养等的研究。
    渔业方面：过去着重研究近海渔业，增加产量，发展渔船和渔具。现在的研究重点是沿海渔业和内陆渔业、水产养殖（特别是综合养鱼）、资源增殖，提高捕捞效率，降低捕捞后损失，改进对鱼群资源的监测，改善海洋环境，使用新的能源动力等。
    林业方面：重视研究提高林木生产率、培育不良环境条件下迅速生长的、有多种效益的林木作物，加强对桉属树种的研究，实行农林兼作制（使传统农业与培育多用途林木作物联系而彼此相互补充的耕作制度），有利于环境改善的树木，森林保护区的管理等。
    增加科研投资
    过去经验表明，农业科技研究的投资回收率很高，有许多国家年回收率超过５０％，有的达１００％。据国际农业研究磋商小组对拉丁美洲一些科研项目的生产效益分析，年回收率至少为２０—４０％，而且发展中国家的社会效益回收率一般比发达国家的要高。
    发展中国家对农业科研投资在６０年代和７０年代有很大发展。如拉丁美洲增加５．８倍，亚洲增加６．９倍，非洲增加３．６倍。发达国家由于农业科研基础好，投资增加不如过去。如加拿大和美国在同一时期的研究经费只增长１．９倍和２．４倍。但是，农业科研经费占农业总产值的比例，发达国家仍高于发展中国家，如北美为３％，而非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲均不到１％。另据国际农业研究磋商小组的调查报告说，１９８５年，按每百万公顷的耕地拥有的科研人员统计，有２０个发展中国家不到５０名，９个国家不到２５名，而西欧国家则有２０６名，研究经费１５７０万美元。两个科技较先进的发展中国家印度和巴西，前者每百万公顷耕地有１４名科研人员和７３万美元研究经费，后者有４１名科研人员和２４４万美元研究经费。发展中国家的科研手段和条件也比不上发达国家。因此，它们必须继续完备农业科研的设施，并高度重视培养农业科技人才。
