Two research institutions in Beijing have successfully applied tissue culture technology to cabbage hybridization and seed production. Using this new technology, a single cabbage stem can propagate into 100,000 plants in just five months, achieving a 100% hybrid seed rate. It is reported that this breeding technology, when applied to other crops, can significantly shorten the breeding time for hybrid varieties and improve the purity of hybrid seeds.

This research achievement was jointly completed by the Institute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, and the Plant Tissue Culture Technology Experimental Laboratory of Haidian District, Beijing.

　　生物技术用于大白菜杂交成功
    本报讯  北京两家科研单位将生物组织培养技术用于大白菜杂交制种新近获得成功。运用这一新技术，一株大白菜不定芽在５个月内能繁殖成１０万株，种子杂交率能达到１００％。据介绍，此种育种技术推广于其他作物，同样能大大缩短杂交种的选育时间，提高杂交种纯度。
    这项科研成果由中国农科院蔬菜花卉研究所与北京市海淀区植物组织培养技术实验室协作完成。
