Recently, the world's largest aircraft leasing company, GPA Group, headquartered in Ireland, announced that it will order three hundred and eight of the latest aircraft from Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Airbus Industrie, totaling $16.8 billion. This is the largest transaction in aviation history.

The history of the GPA Group is not long; it was established in 1975. With the expansion of the aircraft leasing market, the company has developed rapidly. Now, it leases 172 aircraft to 64 airlines in 32 countries. In just 13 years, it has captured 40% of the aircraft leasing market, becoming the world's largest aircraft leasing company. Apart from the GPA Group, other major aircraft leasing companies in the world include the International Lease Finance Corporation of the United States and the Ansett Group of Australia. These three companies control 90% of the world's aircraft leasing market.

By the end of 1987, there were 7,445 civilian aircraft in the world, of which 13% were available for leasing. From 1991 to 1995, 20% of the aircraft scheduled for production worldwide were ordered by leasing companies.

The rapid expansion of the aircraft leasing industry is due to the fact that many medium and small airlines find it difficult to purchase expensive passenger planes. Additionally, the trend towards aviation liberalization in Europe and other regions has also promoted the expansion of the aircraft leasing industry. Due to the relaxation of air traffic control, many companies hope to enter the aviation industry but do not want to invest large amounts of capital at the outset. Therefore, they prefer to lease aircraft. The GPA Company charges 1% of the purchase price of the leased aircraft as the rental fee for each aircraft. For example, the monthly rental for a Boeing 737 passenger plane is $250,000.

　　迅速发展的飞机租赁公司
    最近，总部设在爱尔兰的世界最大的飞机租赁公司ＧＰＡ集团宣布，该公司将向美国波音公司、麦道公司、欧洲空中汽车工业公司订购三百零八架最新型的飞机，总额达一百六十八亿美元。这是世界航空史上最大的一笔交易。
    ＧＰＡ集团的历史不长，它成立于一九七五年。随着飞机租赁市场的扩大，该公司日益发展。现在，它向三十二个国家的六十四家航空公司出租一百七十二架飞机。在十三年的时间里，它在飞机租赁市场所占的份额已达百分之四十，成为世界最大的飞机租赁公司。除ＧＰＡ集团外，世界上大的飞机租赁公司还有美国的国际租赁基金公司、澳大利亚的安瑟特集团。这三家公司占世界飞机租赁市场的百分之九十。
    到一九八七年末，世界共有民航机七千四百四十五架，其中供租赁的占百分之十三。从一九九一年至一九九五年的五年当中，世界预定制造的飞机的百分之二十是由租赁公司订购的。
    飞机租赁业的急速扩大，是因为许多中小航空公司很难购买昂贵的客机。此外，欧洲等地的航空自由化趋势也促进了飞机租赁业的扩大。由于空中管制放宽，许多企业希望加入航空业，但又不想在起步时投入大量的资金，因而它们宁可租赁飞机。ＧＰＡ公司每架飞机的租金是所租飞机购买价格的百分之一，如一架波音７３７客机，一个月的租金就是二十五万美元。　　　　　　　　　　刘迪
