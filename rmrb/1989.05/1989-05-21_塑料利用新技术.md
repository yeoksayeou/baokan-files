Currently, the United States generates 10.5 million tons of plastic waste annually, with only 100,000 tons being recycled. Discarded hard plastic containers account for 30% of the total volume of garbage nationwide. To address the "plastic disaster," several companies are accelerating the development of new technologies for recycling plastics. Experts predict that by the mid-1990s, 75% of plastic waste can be transformed into valuable resources.

The first challenge in recycling plastic waste is sorting and collection. Currently, the New England Container Recycling Company in Massachusetts is constructing the first automated sorting facility in the United States for plastics, glass, aluminum cans, and ferrous metals. This $4 million investment is expected to be completed soon and will be able to process 160 tons of these four types of waste daily. The process involves placing the waste on a conveyor belt, where magnets first separate the ferrous metals. Vibration causes glass items to roll off, while electrodes on both sides of the conveyor belt emit a positive charge to repel aluminum cans. Finally, only plastics remain. These plastics are then compressed, crushed, or turned into granules and sent to specialized factories for further processing.

Wilmington Company is currently the largest plastic recycling enterprise in the United States. Its factories can melt, filter, and spin the polyethylene compounds from recycled plastic soda bottles into thin fibers, which are then used to make carpets, pillows, or other soft materials. High-density polyethylene milk bottles can be recycled into raw materials for making toys, flower pots, or other containers. Wilmington Company is also developing a new process to separate polyethylene and polypropylene from mixed plastic waste, allowing for further utilization of various components.

　　塑料利用新技术
    目前美国每年的塑料垃圾达１０５０万吨，回收利用的仅为１０万吨，废弃的硬塑料容器在全国垃圾堆放体积中占３０％。为对付“塑料灾祸”，一些公司正加紧开发塑料再生利用新技术。专家预计，到９０年代中期，可使７５％的塑料垃圾变废为宝。
    回收利用塑料废物的第一个困难是分类与收集。目前马萨诸塞州新英格兰容器再循环公司正在建造全美首座自动分拣塑料、玻璃、铅罐及铁金属的工厂。这座投资４００万美元的工厂近期完工后，每日可处理１６０吨上述４种垃圾，其程序是：将垃圾堆放在传送带上，由磁铁先将铁金属吸出；通过震荡使玻璃制品滚下来；传送带两边的电极向铝罐放射正电极，再由一个带正电的电场将铝罐排斥出来；最后只剩塑料。塑料经压实、粉碎或变成颗粒状后，运送到专门工厂加工。
    威尔曼公司是目前全美最大的塑料再循环企业，它的工厂可将回收的塑料汽水瓶中的聚乙烯化合物融化、过滤，抽成薄薄的纤维，用来制成地毯、枕头或其他柔软物。还可将高密度聚乙烯牛奶瓶还原成制作玩具、花盆或其他容器的原料。威尔曼公司正在开发的另一种新工艺是，将混合塑料废物中的聚乙烯和聚丙烯分离出来，这样各种成分可得到进一步利用。  　　（仓立德）
