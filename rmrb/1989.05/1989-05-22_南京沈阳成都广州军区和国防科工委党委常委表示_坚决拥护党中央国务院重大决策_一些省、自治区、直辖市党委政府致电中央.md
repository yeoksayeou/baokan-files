The Party Committee of the Shenyang Military Region, during their study of the speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, stated that the situation in Beijing is of great concern to the entire nation and has attracted worldwide attention. The decision by the Central Committee to implement martial law is timely and correct, meeting the needs of the situation. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have tasked the military with the responsibility of executing martial law to maintain the normal order of the capital, which is a constitutional duty and fundamentally serves the interests of the people. They pledged to firmly obey the commands of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, and to work diligently to ensure the Central Committee's trust.

The Party Committee of the Chengdu Military Region, during their discussion and study, formulated specific opinions for implementation. The committee members believed that the Central Committee's decision to implement martial law in Beijing is timely, wise, and necessary. They stated that at this critical moment, when the fate of the Party and the nation is at stake, the Party Central Committee has tasked the military with playing its due role, and they will firmly align with the Party Central Committee, clearly opposing the turmoil.

The Guangzhou Military Region today convened a meeting of military region cadres, calling on all troops in the region to mobilize, unite, and contribute to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation.

All levels of leading cadres must stay at their posts, strengthen the management of their units and troops, and not disappoint the Central Committee's expectations for the military.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 22nd.

Some provincial, autonomous region, and municipal Party committees and governments have sent telegrams to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressing their firm support for the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They also expressed their firm support for the measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stabilize the situation in the capital.

Tianjin Municipality:

The broad Party members, cadres, workers, and staff in Tianjin have listened to and watched Li Peng's speech at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They unanimously believe that Li Peng's speech fully expresses the wishes of hundreds of millions of people. Everyone expressed their firm support for the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, and their firm support for the Party Central Committee and the State Council's major decisions to quell the turmoil.

2. The speech both affirms the patriotic enthusiasm of the students and analyzes the serious consequences of the turmoil; it reflects the Party and government's care for the broad masses of young students, clearly pointing out the nature of this struggle, and clearly distinguishing between two different types of contradictions.

4. They believe that the military's entry into Beijing is the correct move, beneficial to the social stability of the capital. In the past period, the broad cadres and workers have been very concerned about the situation in Beijing, fearing that chaos in the capital would spread nationwide. The Central Committee's decision to send the military into the capital has reassured everyone. Many Party members and cadres said that as long as the military does not cause chaos, the country will not be chaotic. Some workers said that they were afraid of chaos in the capital, and the military's entry into Beijing has made them feel much more at ease.

5. Various levels of Party organizations feel that after listening to Li Peng's speech, they have a clear direction, and their work will be more justified. Various levels of Party organizations have convened emergency meetings, actively carrying out work according to the Central Committee's requirements, requiring Communist Party members to maintain a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee, playing a political advantage, stabilizing the emotions of the workers, firmly guarding their work and production posts, organizing production and market supply.

They will closely unite around the Party Central Committee and the State Council, firmly implement the unified arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and strive to do a good job in Jiangxi, contributing to the stability of the national situation.

2. Seriously study the Central Committee's instructions, unifying the thoughts of various levels of leaders and the broad masses of cadres and people with the spirit of the Central Committee. All levels of Party organizations must quickly organize the broad masses of cadres and people to seriously study and deeply understand the spirit of the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, raise awareness, and unify thoughts. Especially various levels of leading cadres must take the lead in studying well, maintaining a clear mind, clearly understanding their responsibilities, and striving to do a good job. Educate all Communist Party members to strictly abide by Party discipline, not only not participate in any activities that harm stability and unity but also play a vanguard and model role in uniting the masses and stopping the turmoil. They must confidently and targetedly do a good job in ideological education and guidance.

3. Firmly protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students, and not pursue those who had excessive words and deeds during the student movement. At the same time, continue to hold multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form discussions, fully listen to the opinions of all sides. For the reasonable demands of the masses, including young students, give clear answers. For their reasonable criticisms and suggestions, listen to and adopt them seriously, and truly improve the work of various levels of Party committees and governments.

4. Seriously implement the policies of rectification and deepening reform, and firmly grasp various work.

At the same time, adhere to the strict governance of the Party, further strengthen Party building, focus on the work of maintaining the cleanliness of Party and government organs, and strive to eliminate various corrupt phenomena. All levels of Party and government leading organs and leading cadres must, according to the requirements of "clean, efficient, and practical," carry forward the tradition of hard struggle, overcome bureaucratism, improve work style, and better serve the grassroots and the masses.

5. Firmly uphold the Constitution, uphold socialist democracy and legal system.

Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region:

On the evening of May 19, the Standing Committee of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee stayed up all night to listen to and study Li Peng's important speech on behalf of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. On the evenings of May 20 and the afternoon of May 21, they seriously discussed and exchanged views. Everyone firmly supported Li Peng's speech and the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's decisive and firm measures against the turmoil. They unanimously believed that if the CPC Central Committee and the State Council did not timely stop this turmoil, which aims to negate the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system and has spread to Urumqi and many other cities across the country, there would be no peace for the country or the people. The achievements of China's reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations would be lost, and the fate and future of the Party and the state would be unthinkable.

The CPC Central Committee and the State Council's firm determination and measures to stop the turmoil represent the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups across the country. We will firmly implement them, unswervingly adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, clearly oppose the turmoil, and maintain high political unity with the Party Central Committee.

On May 19, some rioters in Urumqi, Xinjiang, under the pretext of protesting against the already seriously dealt with book "Sexual Customs," incited some unsuspecting masses to attack the organs of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress, the Advisory Committee, and the Discipline Inspection Commission, creating a rare and extremely serious incident of smashing, looting, and rioting in the history of our region, creating a turmoil. Currently, we are concentrating our efforts to deal with this incident. We will definitely follow the correct policy of the Central Committee to stop the turmoil, follow the spirit of Li Peng's speech, correctly handle this turmoil that threatens the stability and unity of Xinjiang, and ensure the stability of Xinjiang. Please rest assured, Central Committee and State Council.

For things that can and should be solved, they must be truly handled. Leading organs must welcome and value dialogues with various levels.

4. The broad public security police and armed police soldiers must guard their posts, strive to maintain traffic order and social order, strengthen public security management, and resolutely combat various criminal activities. They must also do a good job in preparing for various sudden events.

5. Propaganda and public opinion departments must strengthen guidance and guidance work, do more positive propaganda, and clearly oppose the turmoil. Propaganda and reporting must be conducive to stability and unity, correctly explain the policy boundaries proposed in Li Peng's speech, and distinguish between the broad masses of young students and the few people who incite turmoil. For the broad masses of young students, do not simply criticize and blame, do not settle accounts later, and through study and propaganda, make them raise their awareness and remove their ideological concerns.
