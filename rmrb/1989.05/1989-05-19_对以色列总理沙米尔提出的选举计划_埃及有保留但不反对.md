Egyptian President Mubarak said today that Egypt has some reservations about Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.

Mubarak made the remarks at a banquet hosted for the visiting Emir of Bahrain, Isa bin Sulman Al Khalifa, after which he told the Middle East News Agency: "We are studying this issue. We have some reservations, but we do not oppose this proposal."

Kuwaiti newspapers quoted him as saying that he was concerned that Shamir's election proposal might be a tactic to delay the resolution of the Middle East issue.

After concluding a three-day official visit to Egypt, Bahrain and Egypt issued a joint statement indicating continued support for the 17-month-long struggle of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip against Israel.

The statement held that convening an international peace conference on the Middle East, hosted by the United Nations and attended by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and all relevant parties, including the PLO, is the path to achieving a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the Middle East that the world can accept.

　　对以色列总理沙米尔提出的选举计划    
    埃及有保留但不反对
    新华社开罗５月１８日电  埃及总统穆巴拉克今天说，埃及对以色列总理沙米尔提出在被占领的约旦河西岸和加沙地带举行选举的建议持一些保留意见。
    穆巴拉克在设宴招待来访的巴林埃米尔（国家元首）伊萨·本·苏莱曼·哈利法后对中东社说：“我们正在研究这个问题。我们虽持一些保留意见，但并不反对这个建议。”
    科威特报援引他的话说，他担心沙米尔的选举建议会成为一种旨在拖延解决中东问题的诡计。
    巴林埃米尔在结束３天对埃及的正式访问后双方发表一项联合公报指出，继续支持在约旦河西岸和加沙地带进行的长达１７个月的巴勒斯坦人民的反以斗争。
    公报认为，召开在联合国主持下，由联合国安理会５个常任理事国和包括巴解组织在内的所有有关各方参加的中东和平国际会议是为全世界可以接受的实现中东公正、全面和持久和平的途径。
