Openness—Effective Check and Balance

Zhang Lizhou

The "two open, one supervision" system currently being implemented in some regions has been fully endorsed by central leaders, who describe it as "a good approach to promoting anti-corruption construction." What makes it good? It lies in the combination of government transparency with democratic supervision, using openness to ensure supervision, using openness to achieve supervision, and forming an effective check on power. The premise of this approach is openness, its essence is openness, and its power mainly comes from openness.

Under the conditions where the commodity economy is becoming more active, and during the transition between old and new systems, new systems, orders, and norms need to be established and perfected. It is inevitable that some officials in party and government agencies and enterprises will engage in corrupt behavior. Solving this problem cannot rely on mass movements or moral constraints alone, but rather on deepening reforms, relying on public supervision, and promoting democracy and the rule of law. The core issue of corrupt behavior is the abuse of power, dereliction of duty, favoritism, and the exchange of power for money. Various forms of corruption within the party and society have spread because the power-checking mechanism is weak, and a supervision system including party, administrative, legal, public, and public opinion supervision has not been established. Therefore, the fundamental solution is to "check power with power," granting specialized agencies and the public the means and power to check the abuse of power, especially to establish extensive, regular, and effective public supervision.

Relying on public supervision requires the implementation of open governance, making administrative, market, and enterprise behaviors public. Openness ensures the public's right to know—what has been done, what has not been done, why certain things have not been done, and why certain things have been done. Openness increases the transparency of work, making it impossible to act without following norms, to neglect efficiency, to intentionally obstruct, to treat people differently, or to use power for personal gain without hesitation. Openness turns decisions made by a few into decisions actively participated in by the public, gathering collective wisdom and diverse opinions. Right and wrong will be judged by public consensus, difficulties can be overcome with help and understanding, and subjective errors will be reduced. Although openness cannot completely eliminate corrupt behaviors such as abuse of power and favoritism, these behaviors are more likely to be exposed and resisted under public scrutiny. It can be said that openness is supervision, and openness itself contains an invisible checking force. "Not afraid of internal reports, but afraid of being exposed in the media" is a common mindset among those with bad records. They are not afraid of reporters or publications, but of openness, the public, exposure, and embarrassment. The greatest advantage of public opinion supervision lies in its openness and public nature. The influence and radiation of the two combined on society, psychology, morality, and public opinion should not be underestimated.

Promoting openness is not for the sake of openness itself, but for the sake of checking power. Therefore, anything that benefits anti-corruption efforts, involves public interests, attracts widespread attention, or requires public supervision should be made public as much as possible. In summary, it is "two open": open governance procedures and open governance results. This is the requirement for effective checks. Because judging whether a behavior is clean or corrupt has objective standards, mainly whether it conforms to national policies and behavioral norms. Implementing "two open" means publishing the policies, regulations, procedures, deadlines, and applicable and non-applicable conditions for handling a matter, etc.; and publishing the specific process and results of handling the matter. The public will be familiar with the governance norms and can clearly see whether the governance personnel are acting according to the rules, and whether administrative, market, and enterprise behaviors conform to the norms. If it is not done this way, opening governance procedures without opening governance results makes it impossible for the public to verify behavioral norms with governance results; or opening governance results without opening governance procedures makes it impossible for the public to judge the right and wrong of the matter. Moreover, it should be noted that public supervision is not a one-time completion, but a repeated process. Opening governance procedures allows the public to comment on whether the governance norms are reasonable and fair, which is one supervision. Opening governance results allows the public to comment on whether the governance norms are strictly followed, which is another supervision. If the governance results do not fully conform to the norms, public criticism and corrections by the governance department followed by re-publication can be supervised again.

Thus, through the above "open—supervise—re-open—re-supervise" process repeated many times, a democratic supervision mechanism with public participation is formed, and effective checks are ultimately realized.

Of course, using the mechanism of combining openness with supervision to check power is conditional. The power of the public is immense, and the power of public supervision is enormous. However, these are only potential. Only by guaranteeing and supporting public supervision through institutional and even legislative means, and by legally and impartially investigating and handling corrupt behaviors exposed by the public, can the potential of public supervision be fully realized. Therefore, it is accurate to say that public supervision guaranteed by institutions and laws can become an effective checking force.

　　公开——有效的制衡
    张黎洲
    正在一些地区推行的“两公开一监督”，中央领导同志给予充分肯定，称之为“促进廉政制建设的好路子”。它好在哪里？就好在把政务公开与民主监督结合起来，用公开来保证监督，用公开来实现监督，形成了对权力的有效制衡。这个办法的前提是公开，要旨是公开，威力也主要来自公开。
    在商品经济开始趋于活跃的条件下，在新旧体制交替变换的过程中，新的体制、秩序、规范有待确立和完善，党政机关和企事业单位某些工作人员中出现不廉洁行为，是难以避免的。解决这个问题，不能靠群众运动，也不能光靠道德约束，而要靠深入改革，靠群众监督，靠民主与法治。不廉洁行为的核心问题，是弄权渎职，徇私舞弊，以权谋私，权钱交易。党内和社会上种种腐败现象得以滋生蔓延，则是由于权力制衡机制不力，没有建立起包括党内的、行政的、法律的、群众的、舆论的监督体系。因此，治本的办法是“以权力制衡权力”，赋予专门机构和人民群众制衡滥用职权行为的手段和权力，尤其要建立广泛的、经常的、有效的群众监督。
    依靠群众监督，就得实行办事公开，把行政行为、市场行为、企业行为公诸于众。公开，保障了群众的知情权，什么事办了，什么事没办，该办的事为什么没办，不该办的事为什么办了，让群众心中有数；公开，提高了工作的透明度，不按规范办事不行，不讲办事效率不行，有意刁难、看人行事也不行，想利用职权干见不得人的事更不能不有所顾忌；公开，变少数人的决策为群众积极参与的决策，群策群力，七嘴八舌，是非曲直自有公论，碰到困难可以取得帮助谅解，主观随意性造成的失误也会减少；公开，虽然不能完全杜绝弄权渎职、徇私枉法的腐败现象，但它们在众目睽睽之下，比较容易败露，也比较容易受到抵制。可以说，公开就是监督，公开本身就包含了无形的制衡力量。“不怕通报，就怕登报”是有劣迹者的共同心态。他们并不是怕记者，也不是怕报刊，而是怕公开，怕群众，怕曝光，怕亮丑。舆论监督最大的优势，就在于它的公开性和群众性，两者融合而产生的对社会、心理、道德、舆论的影响力和辐射力决不可小看。
    讲公开，不是为公开而公开，而是为制衡而公开，因而凡是有利于廉政建设的事情，凡是涉及群众利益的事情，凡是引起普遍关注的事情，凡是需要群众监督的事情，都要尽量公开。概括起来就是“两公开”：公开办事制度，公开办事结果，这是有效制衡提出的要求。因为判断某个行为是廉洁还是不廉洁，有其客观的标准，主要就是看它是否符合国家政策的规定，是否合乎行为规范。实行“两公开”，既公布办某件事的政策、规章、程序、期限以及适用和不适用条件，等等；又公布事情办理的具体过程和具体结果，群众对办事规范了如指掌，对办事人员是否照章办事，行政行为、市场行为、企业行为是否合乎规范也可以看得一清二楚。如果不是这样，公开办事制度而不公开办事结果，群众无法以办事结果来验证行为规范；或者公开办事结果而不公开办事制度，群众则无从判断事情的是非曲直，这都不可能真正实行群众监督。而且还要看到，群众监督不是一次性完成的，而是一个反复不断的过程。公开办事制度，群众对办事规范是否合理公道可以评说，这是一次监督。公开办事结果，群众对办事规范是否切实执行又可以评说，这是又一次监督。办事结果如若不尽合乎规范，群众批评和办事部门改正之后再次公布，还可以再次接受监督。
    这样，经过上述这种“公开——监督——再公开——再监督”多次反复的过程，形成一种群众性的民主监督的制衡机制，有效制衡才得以最终实现。
    当然，通过公开与监督相结合的机制来制衡权力，是有条件的。群众的力量是无穷的，群众监督的威力是巨大的，但是，这些都只是潜在的。只有用制度以至立法的形式来保证和支持群众监督，对群众揭露的不廉洁行为依法秉公查处，群众监督的潜在作用才能充分发挥出来。所以准确地说，有制度和法律保证的群众监督，才能成为有效的制衡力量。
