A beverage with excellent anti-aging effects—"874" syrup from prickly ash—has been successfully developed by a team of young and middle-aged teachers from the Guizhou Agricultural College, including Wu Li, Shen Yang, and Tan Aijuan. The product recently passed provincial-level appraisal in Guiyang.

Prickly ash, also known as "send spring back," is a precious wild fruit unique to Guizhou with abundant resources. "874" syrup from prickly ash contains active substances such as superoxide dismutase, which have anti-cancer and anti-aging effects. Clinical observations involving 239 middle-aged and elderly individuals from Shanghai, Chengdu, and Guizhou showed that after consumption, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in human red blood cells significantly increased, while the content of lipid peroxides (LPO) in human plasma decreased, indicating a positive effect on delaying aging.
