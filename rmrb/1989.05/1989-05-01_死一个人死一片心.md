In a black community on the outskirts of Miami, on the evening of March 20 around 10 PM, two gunmen dressed in camouflage military uniforms casually walked into Lee Lawrence's grocery store and fired thirty shots at Lawrence, then calmly left the scene. Nothing was stolen from the store. The police believe this was the work of professional hitmen and is related to drug trafficking.

In Miami, where drug trafficking is rampant, people have become accustomed to murder cases. However, Lawrence's death shook the entire community and the media.

Lawrence was a 51-year-old black man who had lived in the area for forty years. Two years ago, a feature article about him in the *Miami Herald* brought him to prominence.

Miami is a haven for drug traffickers. Lawrence lived in a thriving black community drug market. This store owner was deeply opposed to the spread of drugs. For over five years, he drove drug dealers out of his grocery store's parking lot, assisted the police in cracking down on drug markets, and went to middle schools to educate students about the dangers of drugs. People called him a model in the fight against drugs.

Since then, Lawrence became a thorn in the side of drug traffickers. In the past two years, he had received numerous threatening phone calls. However, Lawrence did not back down in the face of death threats, but had to be on high alert. He requested police protection. Logically, such a rare anti-drug activist should receive special protection from the police, but the police department refused on the grounds of insufficient manpower.

Drug traffickers had attempted to harm him three times but failed. Lawrence's small store was riddled with bullet holes. People said this was evidence of Lawrence's struggle against drug dealers.

On the evening of March 20 around 10 PM, the drug traffickers finally achieved their long-planned goal. Lawrence lay in a pool of blood, and police cars surrounded the grocery store. Lawrence's wife, Sarah, pointing to Lawrence's body, told the police, "He was a brave man, and now he's dead. Now there are so many police here, but where were you when it happened?"

From the 1987 *Miami Herald* interview, it is clear that the police were aware that someone was planning to harm Lawrence, but why did they not provide protection? Some people believe that if Lawrence were white, he might have received better protection. The police did not want to provide protection, intending to limit the uncontrollable drug epidemic to the black community. The police, of course, denied this. However, the death of Lawrence, who fought alone, proves what? The neighbors drew the lesson: fighting drug dealers alone is so dangerous!

*The New York Times* published an editorial on this, saying that the police did not issue a license for the murder, but they did nothing to prevent the tragedy. This newspaper raised a question: When the police need ordinary citizens to help fight drug dealers, where will they find a second Lawrence? Drug traffickers not only killed one person; they have killed the will of people to fight against drug dealers.

Lawrence's death, from one aspect, explains why it is difficult to control the spread of drugs in American society.

　　死一个人死一片心
    迈阿密郊区的一个黑人社区。今年三月二十日晚十时许，两名身穿保护色陆军制服的枪手大摇大摆地走进李·劳伦斯的杂货店，向劳伦斯连射三十发子弹，随即不慌不忙地离开现场。店内分文未少。警察当局认为，这是职业杀手所为，与毒品有关。
    在毒品交易泛滥的迈阿密，人们对凶杀事件习以为常。但是，劳伦斯被害，却震动了整个社区和舆论界。
    劳伦斯是位五十一岁的黑人，在当地生活了四十年。两年前，《迈阿密论坛报》登了一篇关于他的专访使他出了名。
    迈阿密是贩毒分子的窝。劳伦斯居住的正是一个毒品市场兴旺的黑人社区。这位店主对毒品的泛滥深恶痛绝。五年多来，他把贩毒分子从杂货店的停车场上撵走，协助警察扫荡毒品市场，到中学去宣传毒品的害处……人们称他是反毒品的楷模。
    从此，劳伦斯成了贩毒分子的眼中钉。近两年来，他多次接到恐吓电话。但是，劳伦斯面对死亡的威胁并不让步，但又不得不严加提防。他请求警察提供保护。照理，像这样一名难得的反毒人士警察应提供特殊保护，可是警察局却以人手不足而拒绝。
    贩毒分子曾三次对他下毒手而未遂。劳伦斯的小店墙上弹痕累累。人们说，这是劳伦斯同贩毒者斗争的见证。
    三月二十日晚上十时许，贩毒分子终于达到了蓄谋已久的目的。劳伦斯躺在血泊中，杂货店周围布满了警车。劳伦斯的妻子莎拉指着劳伦斯的尸体对警察说：“这是个勇敢的人，他死了。现在这里挤满了警察，可是出事的时候，你们又在哪里？”
    从一九八七年《迈阿密论坛报》的那篇采访记看，警察早就知道有人要对劳伦斯下毒手，但是为什么不提供保护呢？有人认为，如果劳伦斯是白人，也许可以得到较好的保护，警察不想提供保护，是要把难于控制的毒品瘟疫局限于黑人社区，警方当然矢口否认。但是孤军作战的劳伦斯之死又说明了什么呢？邻居们得出的教训是：同毒品贩子孤军作战是多么危险！
    《纽约时报》就此发表一篇社论说，警察并未发给凶犯杀人许可证，但是他们也没有为制止悲剧发生做任何事情。这家报纸提出了一个问题：当警察需要普通公民帮助对付贩毒分子时，他们到哪里去找第二个劳伦斯呢？贩毒分子不只是杀了一个人，他们已扼杀了人们同贩毒分子作斗争的意愿。
    劳伦斯之死从一个侧面说明了美国社会的毒品泛滥为什么难于控制。
