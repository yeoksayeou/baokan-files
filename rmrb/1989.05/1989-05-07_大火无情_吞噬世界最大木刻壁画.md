A merciless fire devoured the world's largest woodcut mural.

On May 5, a fire at the "San Lazaro" Legislative Assembly Building in Mexico not only destroyed this magnificent building but also burned down the world's largest woodcut mural, "The History of the Mexican Constitution." The author, Adolfo Mexiac, lamented that this loss was like losing a beloved child.

Hanging in the main hall of the Legislative Assembly Building, this giant woodcut mural has a central section that is 35 meters long and 6 meters high. Including the head and tail sections, the total area is 350 square meters. The entire mural is carved from carefully selected and pest-resistant Mexican rosewood (formerly translated as cedar). The magnificent scroll depicts the history of the Mexican Revolution, which began in 1917, and the birth and evolution of the constitution. Adolfo Mexiac said that with the help of 12 people, he worked continuously for 18 months to complete this masterpiece. This is not only his personal effort and dedication but also the enthusiasm of countless people for building a new Legislative Assembly Building. Although he can recreate a more perfect work, the loss of this "History of the Mexican Constitution" is undoubtedly a part of his life.

　　大火无情    
    吞噬世界最大木刻壁画
    五月五日，墨西哥“圣·拉萨罗”立法议会大厦一场火灾不仅毁坏了这座雄伟的大厦，而且烧毁了目前世界上最大的木刻壁画《墨西哥宪法历史》。作者阿道夫·梅夏克不胜惋惜地说，这使他感到痛失爱子一般。
    悬挂在议会大厦前厅上方的这幅巨型木刻壁画，中心部分长达三十五米，高六米，加上头尾两部分总面积达三百五十平方米，全部用精选并经过防蛀处理的墨西哥桃花心木（前译雪松木）刻成。壮丽的画卷描绘了一九一七年开始的墨西哥革命及宪法诞生、演变的历史。阿道夫·梅夏克说，他在十二人的协助下，连续工作十八个月才完成了这幅巨作。这不仅是他个人的心血与努力，也倾注了无数人对建设新立法大厦的热情。虽然他还可以重新创作一幅比这更完美的作品，但是，失去的这一幅《墨西哥宪法历史》无疑是他生命的一部分。
