	According to a report by the *China Science Daily*, recently, Pan Jixing, a research fellow in the history of natural sciences at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, presented conclusive evidence confirming that paper existed in China during the Western Han Dynasty. This pushes back the history of paper-making in China by at least two centuries.

	The 18th volume of the *Book of the Later Han* records Cai Lun's invention of papermaking, which is widely accepted. However, in 1957, paper was unearthed in Shaanxi's Maqiao, in 1973, paper was unearthed in Gansu's Jinguang, and in 1978, paper was unearthed in Shaanxi's Zhongyan. All of these papers were found in Western Han tombs or sites. At the end of 1987, Pan Jixing sent samples of these four types of paper fibers to the Kyoto Institute of Production and Development Science, the Kochi Paper Industry Testing Center, and the Tokyo Akashi Optical Technology Corporation for identification. All confirmed that the samples were plant fiber paper, with the Maqiao paper being the most primitive.

	In September 1986, a paper map was unearthed from a Western Han tomb in Fangmatan, Tianshui City, Gansu Province, providing further strong evidence for the above findings.

　　西汉有纸获确凿证据  造纸历史上推二百年
    本报讯  据《中国科学报》报道，中国科学院自然科学史研究员潘吉星最近展示确凿证据，证实早在西汉时中国就有了纸，中国造纸的历史起码要向前推进两个世纪。
    《后汉书》第１８卷记载的蔡伦造纸术，为世人所公认。但是，１９５７年陕西出土的灞桥纸，１９７３年甘肃出土的金关纸，１９７８年陕西出土的中颜纸，均出土于西汉古墓或遗址。１９８７年底，潘吉星将上述四种纸纤维样品分别请日本京都生产开发科学研究所、高知纸业试验场、东京明石光学技术株式会社中心鉴定，均确定被检样品为植物纤维纸，其中灞桥纸较原始。
    １９８６年９月，在甘肃省天水市放马滩西汉墓出土了一张纸地图，又为上述观点提供了有力证据。
