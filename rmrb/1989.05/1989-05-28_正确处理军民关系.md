	Properly Handling Military-Civilian Relations
	Sun Chuanwen

	The oil depot of a certain air force unit under the Guangzhou Military Region is an important military facility. In the past, when the unit's leadership encountered issues that might affect the depot's safety, they often analyzed the situation from a class struggle perspective, suspecting enemy sabotage. This approach did not reduce the safety risks and sometimes even affected military-civilian unity.

	Of course, protecting military facilities requires a high degree of vigilance, and the awareness of potential threats should not be neglected. However, years of practice have shown that the factors frequently affecting the depot's safety are not enemy sabotage but rather conflicts of interest between the military and civilians that have not been well-coordinated. To effectively protect the depot's safety, the unit's leadership updated their mindset and learned to use legal means to handle issues.

	In November 1987, several villagers near the depot chose a piece of land outside the depot's wall for building houses. The depot's leadership explained to them the reasons why they should not build houses near the depot and asked them to relocate. They not only refused but a young man even threatened, "If you don't let us build houses, I think you're asking for trouble!" The depot's leadership did not view this young man as an "enemy" but instead invited officials from the township government and the local police station to assist in persuading and resolving the issue. After persuasion failed, the police station, based on the relevant regulations of the "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security," ordered the young man to demolish the house and its foundation within a specified time and imposed a fine. The other several households of farmers also relocated after being persuaded. The villagers felt that the military leadership and the local government did not arbitrarily label or punish those who endangered the depot's safety but instead explained the reasons and handled the matter according to the law, making the punishment acceptable.

	The county committee and county government also convened meetings with officials from the public security bureau, land management bureau, and township and village cadres to decide on dividing the military's managed area into a military restricted area, military management area, and military safety area, stipulating that no one is allowed to occupy military land. If there are violations, legal actions will be taken. They hold two symposiums and one joint inspection each year, regularly conduct national defense education for the villagers, and ensure that military and civilian cooperation in protecting the depot's safety is implemented. Once, a villager named Xiao Jiang was working in the fields and smelled gasoline on the side of the road. After carefully searching and not finding any oily items, he immediately rushed to the depot to report the incident. Yang, the deputy county magistrate, upon hearing this, led public security personnel and militia department officials to inspect the oil pipeline with the depot's soldiers. Finally, they discovered a small hole in a welded joint of the pipeline and promptly eliminated the potential accident in its infancy.

	This important oil depot, under the joint efforts of the military and civilians, has been safe and accident-free for 16 years since its construction. It has been consecutively awarded the honorable title of an advanced unit by the Guangzhou Military Region Air Force, the Air Force, and the General Staff Department.

　　正确处理军民关系
    孙传文
    广州军区空军某油库，是重要的军事设施。过去，守库部队领导碰到可能影响油库安全的事情时，往往用阶级斗争观点进行分析，朝敌人破坏方面想。这样做，并没有减少不安全因素，有时还影响了军民团结。
    当然，保护军事设施，是要有高度警惕性的，敌情观念也不能没有。但多年的实践证明，经常出现的影响油库安全的因素，不是敌人的破坏，而是军民之间存在的某些利益上的矛盾，没有得到很好协调造成的。为了有效地保护油库安全，守库部队领导更新观念，学会运用法律手段来处理问题。
    １９８７年１１月，油库驻地几家村民把油库围墙外的一块地选作建房宅基。油库领导向他们说明不应在油库附近建房的道理，让他们拆迁。他们不但不听，有个男青年还威胁说：“你们不让我们建房，我看是活得不耐烦了！”油库领导没有把这个青年人看成是“敌人”，而是请乡政府和派出所的同志来协助劝解和处理。派出所在劝解无效后根据《治安管理处罚条例》的有关规定，对这个青年作了限期拆除房屋宅基和罚款的处理。其他几户农民经过做工作，也都拆迁了。村民们认为，部队领导和地方政府对妨害油库安全的行为，不乱扣帽子，乱打棍子，既说明道理，又依法办事，挨罚也服气。
    县委和县政府还召集公安局、土地管理局、乡村干部商量决定，把军队管理地界划分为军事禁区、军事管理区和军事安全区，规定任何人不得侵占军队土地。如有违反，依法处理。每年召开两次座谈会，进行一次联合大检查，经常对农民进行国防教育，使军民共管油库安全落到实处。一次，村民小蒋下田干活，嗅到路旁有汽油味。经过仔细查找，没有发现沾油物品，便立即跑去油库报告。县政府的阳副县长得知此情后，也带领公安人员和人武部同志，协同油库官兵巡查油管线。最后查出一个管线焊接处有一微孔，及时把事故消除在萌芽状态。
    这个重要油库在军民通力合作下，建库１６年安全无事故。先后被广州军区空军、空军和三总部授予先进单位的光荣称号。
