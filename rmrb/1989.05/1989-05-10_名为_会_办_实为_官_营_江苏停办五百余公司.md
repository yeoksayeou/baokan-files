Jiangsu Halts Over 500 Companies

People's Daily reports: Since April last year, Jiangsu Province has intensified its efforts in building a clean government. The discipline inspection, supervision, procuratorate, and audit departments have each performed their duties and strengthened cooperation and coordination. They have made great efforts to clean up companies with party and government officials holding concurrent positions, investigated a number of "official profiteering" cases, and ensured that the building of a clean government is effective.

This province has focused on the issue of party and government agencies running companies since May last year. By the end of October, 1,977 companies with ties to party and government agencies had been identified. These companies are different from those previously established. They are not run in the name of party and government agencies but are operated under various names such as associations, brokerage firms, academic societies, research centers, foundations, veteran cadres' friendship associations, and fishing clubs. Some of these companies deal in high-end consumer goods like color televisions and refrigerators, while others have no fixed capital and operate as "briefcase companies" engaging in illegal business activities and reselling goods, seriously hindering the circulation of goods, driving up prices, and damaging the party's image.

To curb this trend, relevant departments in Jiangsu Province took joint action. After a serious investigation, they ordered the closure of 536 companies and conducted a thorough investigation of another 284 companies. Approximately two-thirds of the 1,157 companies must completely sever ties with party and government agencies before they can be allowed to reopen. To prevent these companies from "disassociating in name but not in reality," the financial departments have exercised their supervisory functions, leaving no loopholes for these companies to evade financial fees and management fees. According to statistics, 2,017 party and government officials were involved in these companies, and 1,970 of them have now resigned from their concurrent positions.

　　名为“会”办　实为“官”营    
    江苏停办五百余公司
    本报讯  江苏省自去年４月下旬开始抓廉政建设后，纪检、监察、检察、审计等部门各司其职，加强相互协作和配合，下大力气清理有党政机关干部兼职的公司，查处一批“官倒”案件，使廉政建设落到实处。
    这个省去年５月以来重点抓了党政机关办公司问题，１０月底即清理出与党政机关有联系的公司１９７７个。这些公司和以往所办的公司不同，不是以党政机关名义举办的，而是以协会、经纪会、学会、研究中心、基金会、老干部联谊会、钓鱼协会等字号改换名目开办，有的经营彩电、冰箱等高档消费品，有的手头根本没有固定资金，仅靠“皮包公司”搞非法经营、转手倒卖，严重阻碍了商品流通，抬高了物价，败坏了党风。
    为刹住这股歪风，江苏省有关部门共同行动，经严肃清查后，责令停办了５３６个公司，另对２８４个公司重点清查。约占２／３的１１５７个公司要与党政机关全部脱钩后才允许重办。为防止这些公司“明脱暗不脱”，财务部门行使监督职能，使这些公司在收财务费、管理费上无空隙可钻。据统计，这个省参与公司兼职的党政干部共２０１７人，现已有１９７０人辞去一头职务。（王健根　席爱鸣）
