The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided to convene its eighth session, and the news has drawn widespread attention and enthusiastic welcome from people of all walks of life.

Reporters from this newspaper conducted interviews in some schools, factories, and government agencies in the capital. Many interviewees believe that the agenda for the next session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which includes listening to reports on the cleanup and rectification of companies, listening to reports on student demonstrations and strikes, reviewing the State Council's proposal to examine the draft "Law of the People's Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions, and Demonstrations," and listening to reports on the drafting of the Press Law, are all hot issues of concern to the general public at present. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress proposed to address these hot issues through legal procedures and directly include them in the agenda of the state power organ, which is excellent and reflects the public's sentiments and will. Many interviewees told the reporter that convening the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress around June 20 and announcing the agenda 40 days in advance is also excellent. This gives the members of the Standing Committee ample time to conduct investigations and research and to listen to the opinions of the general public and legal experts.

A young teacher from Beijing Normal University said, "These agendas collectively reflect some of the most important and reasonable demands raised by young students in recent days and truly bring the resolution of these issues into the track of democracy and the rule of law. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress responded so quickly and timely, which shows that the Party's heart and the people's heart are closely linked with the hearts of the broad masses of young students. This will be a pioneering move and a major event in our country's political life."

In the campus of Peking University, a student told the reporter, "The Standing Committee's decision to formally include students' demands in the agenda of the highest state power organ meets our expectations. I fully support it. It reflects the sincerity of the Party and state leaders in solving the problems we are generally concerned about. In the past, I and my classmates did not pay much attention to the activities of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. This time, after hearing the broadcast, we were very pleased. My classmates said, 'Now the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress really looks like a power organ. Its prestige in our minds has greatly increased.' A worker told the reporter, 'I sympathize with the reasonable demands of the students. I also hope that some problems can be truly and practically solved. Now that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is going to review and discuss these issues, I hope that young students can maintain calmness and restraint and create a good environment and harmonious atmosphere for the smooth resolution of these issues. I think we should calmly and rationally deal with those major issues related to the destiny and future of the country. This is the most important thing at present."

    把解决问题纳入民主和法制的正确轨道     
    希望学生冷静克制为会议创造良好环境
    本报北京５月１２日讯　人大常委会委员长会议决定召开第八次常委会议的消息发布后，引起各界人士的普遍关注和热烈欢迎。
    本报记者在首都的一些学校、工厂和机关进行了采访。许多被采访者认为，下次人大常委会的议题，包括听取关于清理整顿公司情况的汇报、听取关于学生游行示威和罢课问题的汇报、审议国务院关于提请审议《中华人民共和国集会游行示威法（草案）》的议案和听取关于新闻法起草情况的汇报，这都是当前广大群众最关心的热点问题。人大常委会委员长会议建议把这些热点问题通过法律程序，直接列为国家权力机构的议程，太好了，反映了人心、民意。许多被采访者向记者表示，６月２０日左右召开人大常委会议，现在提前４０天就提出议程，也太好了，这使人大常委委员有充分的时间进行调查研究，听取广大群众和法学专家的意见。
    一位北京师范大学的青年教师说，这些议程集中反映了近日来青年学生提出的一些最重要的合理要求，并将这些问题的解决真正纳入了民主和法制的轨道。人大常委会委员长会议如此迅速和及时地作出了反应，说明党心、民心是和广大青年学生之心紧紧联在一起的，这将是我国政治生活中的一个创举，一件大事。
    在北大校园，一位学生告诉记者，委员长会议把学生的要求正式确定为国家最高权力机关常设机构的议程，符合我们的愿望，我非常拥护。它反映了党和国家高层领导解决我们普遍关心的问题的诚意。过去我和周围的同学对人大常委会的活动不太注意，这次听到广播后十分惊喜。同学们说，这下子人大常委会真像个权力机关了。它在我们心目中的威信一下子提高了。一位工人对记者说，学生的合理要求我是同情的。我也希望能够真正扎扎实实地解决一些问题。现在既然人大常委会要审议和讨论这些问题，我非常希望青年学生能够保持冷静和克制，为顺利解决这些问题创造良好的环境和和谐的气氛。我认为，我们都要冷静地、理智地对待那些关系国家命运前途的重大问题。这是当前最重要的。
