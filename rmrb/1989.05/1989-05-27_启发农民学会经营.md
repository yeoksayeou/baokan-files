Before the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, farmers were simply producers who worked for wages. After the system was put in place, every household became a production and management unit, and farmers took on dual roles as producers and managers. However, due to deeply ingrained production concepts and living habits formed over many years, farmers found it difficult to shed their identity as mere producers. Even after years of land contracting, their management awareness remained weak. This to some extent affected the improvement of agricultural economic benefits and is the fundamental reason for the stagnation in agriculture. Therefore, to help agriculture quickly break out of this stagnation, township and village cadres who work directly with farmers must use practical economics to help farmers strengthen their management awareness. Over the past two years, we have conducted some explorations in this area and achieved initial results. Some farmers have undergone changes in three aspects.

First, changing from not calculating costs and working blindly to emphasizing efficiency and working with calculations.

In 1987, I surveyed more than 10 farmers about the cost of grain production, and most of them could not say how much it cost to produce 1 kilogram of grain. Not calculating costs for farming is quite common. For example, when the price of fertilizer skyrocketed, farmers complained about the high cost but used more, while abandoning free farm manure. Traditional methods of making fertilizer, such as pressing green manure and fermenting yellow manure, have almost disappeared in all 23 villages and towns in the county. In the use of other production materials, few people analyze the input and output. It is precisely this blind production behavior that leads to the disproportionate growth of input and output. Aiming at the weakness of farmers' thin cost awareness, we tried to introduce the cost accounting system into some households, making the material input play the best role. Fengjiabaita is a village with weak sideline industries, and there is no external material input in agriculture. Last year, due to the introduction of the economic accounting system, it created a high efficiency of 150 yuan input and 2000 yuan output in the face of a significant price increase in production materials. Their method is to calculate every step. First, calculate on the land: the village's 100 mu of melon and vegetable fields produce three crops a year, cutting spring bok choy to plant watermelon, pulling watermelon vines to plant cabbage, making full use of the land and improving the output rate. Second, calculate the input: fertilizers are expensive, buy less and apply precisely, with farm manure as the mainstay. The whole set of skills, such as dismantling kang bricks, making pen manure, pressing green manure, and fermenting yellow manure, are all used. The plastic film covering the early spring vegetables is used with great care, and a batch of film can be used for 3 years. Some households plant cucumbers to save the investment of building frames and create a method of planting cucumbers under the corn seedlings. Third, calculate the sales: either travel long distances to sell in other places, or store them for off-season sales, all of which can sell at a good price. In grain production, it is also repeatedly calculated. Last year, the cost of each kilogram of grain was less than 2 jiao. The villagers happily said: it is not that farming does not pay off, but that we did not know how to calculate before!

Second, changing from being led by the market to taking the initiative when the market moves.

In the past few years, phenomena such as the devaluation of cabbage and watermelon have occurred in Sanhe. Some farmers in my town who suffered losses in the devaluation wave did not know the root cause and mistakenly thought: "bad luck." In fact, it is because they are not familiar with market economics.

Objectively speaking, farmers now are not completely without market awareness, but most of them have little market knowledge. A certain agricultural product has a good price this year, and the next year it will rise in a rush; the next year, when the price drops due to an increase in supply, it will disperse in a rush the following year. This passive way of being led by the market in management can only keep the benefits at a low level of stagnation. Aiming at this situation, we repeatedly explained the changing laws of market supply and demand to farmers, guiding them to learn to predict the market and adapt to changes. Some farmers in the vegetable specialty village of Luzhuangzi, through market prediction, planted vegetables with short production cycles according to the market trend, and planted vegetables with long production cycles against the market trend, both achieving good results. In grain production, sorghum has always been difficult to sell at a good price due to its poor taste, and people do not like to eat it. Therefore, in recent years, fewer and fewer people have planted sorghum. However, last year, some farmers in Dabaozhuang and Xiaobozhuang expanded the sorghum planting area. They believed that although people do not like to eat sorghum, people's lives cannot do without sorghum by-products—kaoliang stalks and sorghum seedlings for tying brooms. This year, these two things indeed had a good market, and one mu of sorghum could earn about 400 yuan, exceeding the income of wheat, and the cost was half that of wheat. Now, every step is taken by looking at the market, which has become a standardized behavior for some farmers.

Third, changing from only farming their own contracted land to continuously developing land outside their contracted land.

The development of commodity production in rural areas has a broad prospect, but the vision of most farmers is limited to the few mu of land they have contracted, and they do not see the natural resources outside their contracted land. When the potential of the contracted land is fully exploited to a certain extent, there is no new resource to supplement it, and agriculture will inevitably stagnate. Taking my town as an example, before 1987, there were more than 1,500 mu of water surface, more than 4,000 mu of sandy wasteland, and long-term dormant embankments. The utilization rate of the land in front of and behind the farmers' houses was also very low. We promoted the idea of large-scale agriculture, talking about the long-term benefits of developing resources for the benefit of future generations and the short-term benefits of using abandoned resources for large-scale management. The young farmer Liu Fa from Zhangjiabaita Village used the money he planned to buy a color TV and refrigerator to develop resources and build a farm, earning a pure income of 170,000 yuan in one year. Li Renpu, a 70-year-old man from Dabaozhuang, had always been "waiting for the rabbit by the tree" in his contracted land. Last year, he developed 5 mu of barren riverbank land and earned 2,500 yuan. Last year, 300 farmers in the entire town developed land outside their contracted land, making 40% of the wasteland and abandoned pits usable, and the agricultural output value increased by 27.5% compared to the previous year.

Breaking through the stagnation in agriculture requires a significant increase in investment. However, if the core issue of agriculture (farmers' quality) is ignored, high investment does not necessarily mean high output. On this issue, it is better to adhere to the two-point theory: the state does everything possible to increase investment, and farmers do everything possible to improve their quality. The combined efforts of both will generate new and powerful momentum.

专栏：怎样突破徘徊？——农业发展问题讨论

　　启发农民学会经营
    李连才
    在土地实行承包责任制之前，农民是出工挣分的单纯生产者。实行承包责任制后，千家万户都成为生产、经营单位，农民具有了生产、经营的双重身份。但是，由于多年形成的生产观念、生活习惯根深蒂固，农民很难去掉单纯生产者的胎迹。承包土地多年，经营意识仍然不强。这在一定程度上影响了农业经济效益的提高，这也正是农业出现徘徊的基础因素。因此，要使农业尽快走出徘徊，作为与农民直接打交道的乡镇干部，必须用土坷垃里的经济学帮助农民强化经营意识。近两年，我们在这方面进行了一些探索。取得初步成效，部分农民发生了三个方面的变化。
    一、变不计成本懵着干为讲究效益算着干。
    １９８７年，我向１０多个农民调查粮食成本，多数人说不出每生产１公斤粮食究竟花多少钱。种地不算帐，这是比较普遍的。比如，在化肥价格暴涨的情况下，农民嘴里嚷贵，手里多撒，而把不用花分文的农家肥弃之田外。压绿肥、沤黄肥等传统造肥法在全镇２３个村街中几乎绝迹。在其它各项生产资料的使用上也很少有人做投入与产出的分析。正是这种懵着干的生产行为，导致投入与产出的增长不成正比。针对农民成本观念淡薄的弱点，我们试着把成本核算制度引入部分农户，使物质的投入发挥了最佳效益。冯家白塔是个工副业薄弱的村，农业上没有外部物质力量输入。去年，由于引入了经济核算制度，在生产资料大幅度涨价的情况下，竟创造出１５０元的投入、２０００元产出的高效益。他们的做法就是步步算。一在土地上算：全村的１００亩瓜菜地一年收三茬，割了春菠菜栽西瓜，西瓜拉秧种白菜，使土地得到充分利用，提高了产出率。二在投入上算：化肥贵，少买精施，种地以农家肥为主。拆炕坯、造圈肥、压绿肥、沤黄肥等全套武艺都拿出来。早春菜覆盖的薄膜使用时格外小心，一批膜可用３年。有的户种黄瓜为节省搭架的投资，创造出玉米秧底下栽黄瓜的妙法。三在销售上算：或长途跋涉异地销售，或储藏起来反季销售，都能卖上好价钱。在粮食生产上也是反复计算。去年每公斤粮成本不足２角钱。村民们高兴地说：不是种地不上算，而是过去不会算！
    二、变被市场牵着鼻子走为市场欲动我先行。前几年，在三河境内曾连续出现大白菜贬值、西瓜贬值等现象。我镇一些在贬值浪潮中吃了亏的农民不知道病根在哪里，错误地认为：“运气不好”。实际是因为不熟悉市场学。
    客观地说，现在的农民并不是一点市场观念没有，但大多数市场知识很少。某种农产品今年价好，明年就一轰而起；明年东西多了价跌下来，后年又一轰而散。这种被动地让市场牵着鼻子走的经营方式，其效益只能在低水平上徘徊。针对这种状况，我们给农民反复讲市场供求关系的变化规律，引导农民学习预测市场，以变应变。蔬菜专业村芦庄子部分农民通过预测市场，对生产周期短的菜顺行情种植，对生产周期长的反行情种植，均取得较好的成效。在粮食生产上，高粱由于口感差，人们不爱吃，一直卖不上好价钱。因此，近几年种高梁的越来越少。去年大堡庄，小薄各庄的部分农民却扩大高梁种植面积。他们认为，人们虽然不爱吃高梁，但人们的生活却离不开高梁的副产品——秫秸和捆笤帚用的高梁苗。今年果然这两种东西行情很好，一亩高梁可收入４００元左右，超过了小麦的收入，成本比小麦低一半。现在，每迈一步先看市场，这已成为部分农民的规范行为。
    三、变只种自家责任田为不断开发田外田。农村发展商品生产具有广阔的天地，可是大部分农民的眼光仅局限在承包的几亩地里，看不见责任田以外的自然资源，当责任田的潜力挖掘到一定程度的时候，又没有新的资源补充，农业必然出现徘徊。拿我镇来说，１９８７年以前有１５００多亩面积的水面，４０００多亩沙荒地和堤坎长期沉睡，农户房前屋后的零地利用率也很低。我们就宣传大农业思想，讲开发资源造福子孙的长远利益和利用废弃资源搞规模经营的近期效益。张家白塔村的青年农民刘发用准备买彩电冰箱的钱开发资源建农场，一年纯收入达１．７万元。大堡庄７０多岁的李仁普老汉，过去一直在责任田里“守株待兔”。去年他开发５亩荒河滩地收入２５００元。去年全镇有３００名农民开发田外田，使４０％的荒地、废坑得到利用，农业产值比上年增长２７．５％。
    突破农业徘徊，增加投入是非常必要的。但是如果忽视了农业核心的基础问题（农民素质），高投入未必有高产出。在这个问题上还是坚持两点论为好，国家千方百计增加投入，农民千方百计提高素质，上下形成合力就能产生新的强大动力。
