Japan's imports of drinking water last year increased by 2.6 times compared to the previous year. It is estimated that this year's imports will further increase significantly. Antarctic ice blocks and Alaskan glacial water, packaged in plastic bags, are sold as "high-end products" and are very popular.

In the past, Japanese people believed that "Japan's tap water is the sweetest in the world" and that "water should be free," so the sales of mineral water were always low. Recently, Japan has seen a trend towards high-end products. Young people believe that "adding chlorinated tap water will ruin the taste of wine" and that "French sparkling mineral water should be used instead of aperitifs," so the import of drinking water began to increase from last year.

The increase in the import of mineral water is particularly rapid. In 1987, it increased by three times compared to the previous year, reaching 3.547 million liters, and last year it increased by 2.6 times, reaching 9.91 million liters. This year, it is expected to increase further.

Major Japanese beverage companies are joining the trend of importing foreign "famous water" and "famous ice." Kirin Beer Company began importing mineral water from U.S. national parks in late March, and Nippon Suisan Kaisha is promoting Antarctic ice blocks and New Zealand glacial water. A sake brewery in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, saw a significant increase in orders simply because it used Alaskan glacial water. According to statistics from the Japan Mineral Water Association, previously, 85% of imported mineral water was supplied to restaurants, but now more than half is for household consumption.

　　日大量进口名水名冰
    迪文
    去年，日本饮用水的进口量比前年增加二点六倍，据估计，今年的进口量将进一步大幅度增加。南极冰块、阿拉斯加冰川的水也被用塑料袋装好出售，被视为“高级商品”，销路甚好。
    过去，日本人认为“日本的自来水在世界上最甜”，“水免费是理所当然的”，因而饮用矿泉水的销量一直很低。最近，日本兴起高级商品热，年轻人认为，“加入带氯气味道的自来水会破坏洋酒味道”，“应该用法国炭酸矿泉水代替饭前酒”，因而从前年开始，饮用水的进口开始增加。
    饮用矿泉水的进口量增加尤为迅速。一九八七年比上一年增加三倍，为三百五十四点七万升，去年则增加二点六倍，达到九百九十一万升，今年将进一步增加。
    日本各大饮料公司纷纷加入这一进口外国“名水”“名冰”的行列。麒麟啤酒公司三月下旬开始输入美国国立公园的矿泉水，日本水产公司则在推销南极的冰块和新西兰冰川的水。日本千叶县一家酿酒厂仅仅因为使用了阿拉斯加的冰川的水，就使订货大幅度增加。据日本矿泉水协会的统计，以前进口的矿泉水的百分之八十五是供应饮食店，而现在一半以上是供家庭消费。
