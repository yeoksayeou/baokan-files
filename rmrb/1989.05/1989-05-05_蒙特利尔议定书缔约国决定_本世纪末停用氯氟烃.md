The Montreal Protocol signatories decided to phase out the production and use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000. The conference of the signatories of the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer concluded this afternoon in Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The conference unanimously adopted the "Helsinki Declaration," which stipulates that the production and use of CFCs and related substances will be halted by the year 2000.

The Chinese delegation proposed at the conference that this meeting should decide to establish an international fund to accelerate the research and development of alternative technologies and substances for CFCs, and to ensure that developing countries can economically obtain suitable alternative substances and technologies.
