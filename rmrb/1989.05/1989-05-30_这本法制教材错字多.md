Title: The Law Education Textbook Has Many Errors
Author: Zhaoyu Xiang
Date: 1989-05-30
Edition: 6

Recently, our unit purchased 65 copies of the textbook "Essential Reading for Cadres on Deepening Legal Education," co-compiled by the Beijing Municipal Committee for Propaganda and the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Justice. While studying, we found that the book has an excessive number of typographical errors. For example, in the section on enterprise law:

* In Article 1, "增强" (strengthen) is printed as "增加" (increase).
* In Article 41, "做好" (do well) is printed as "接好" (connect well).
* In Article 49, "建议" (suggestion) is printed as "建改" (build change).
* In Article 56, "逐步" (gradually) is printed as "遂奇" (strange).
* In Article 59, "未经" (not through) is printed as "末经" (end through).
* In Article 63, "共和国刑法" (Criminal Law of the People's Republic) is printed as "供和国刑法" (supply and country criminal law).

Additionally, the use of punctuation is not standardized. Other legal and regulatory textbooks also have numerous errors. For example:

* On page 10, "充分" (fully) is printed as "究分" (seek division).
* "法制" (legal system) is printed as "法度" (law and degree).
* On page 33, "钢琴" (piano) is printed as "铜琴" (copper piano).
* On page 36, "电熨斗" (electric iron) is printed as "电熨心" (electric iron heart).
* On page 38, "公寓" (apartment) is printed as "公寅" (public yin).
* On page 87, "抵缴" (offset payment) is printed as "低缴" (low payment).
* On page 104, "携带" (carry) is printed as "摅带" (expose carry).
* On page 109, "十年徒刑" (ten-year imprisonment) is printed as "十大徒刑" (ten major imprisonment).

In addition to poor typesetting and proofreading quality, the printing quality is also poor. Some characters and punctuation marks are completely illegible, and some characters are not printed at all.

The editing and proofreading quality of this textbook is truly unacceptable. One wonders where the sense of responsibility of the editors has gone.

### 这本法制教材错字多

    这本法制教材错字多
    最近，我们单位购买了65本由北京市委宣传部和司法局合编的《深化法制教育干部必读》教材。学习中，我们发现这本书的错字实在太多。以书中刊登的企业法为例：第1条“增强”印成了“增加”，第41条“做好”印成了“接好”，第49条“建议”印成了“建改”，第56条“逐步”印成了“遂奇”，第59条“未经”印成了“末经”，第63条“共和国刑法”印成了“供和国刑法”等等，标点符号的使用，有的也不规范。
    其它15篇法律、法规教材错字也随处可见，如第10页上将“充分”印成“究分”，“法制”印成“法度”，33页上将“钢琴”印成“铜琴”，36页上将“电熨斗”印成“电熨心”，38页上将“公寓”印成“公寅”，87页上将“抵缴”印成“低缴”，104页上将“携带”印成“摅带”，109页上将“十年徒刑”印成“十大徒刑”。
    除排版、校对质量不佳外，印刷质量也很差，有的字和标点符号根本看不清，有的字没有印上。
    这本教材，编、校质量这样差，实在令人难以容忍。真不知编书人的责任心哪里去了。
