Students from several universities in the capital visited the reception room of the Central Office and State Council Office Information Office this noon to inquire about the response to their "petition" submitted yesterday. Two officials from the Central Office and State Council Office Information Office received these students.

The information office official said that the "petition" submitted by the students through the information office has been promptly forwarded to the Party Central Committee and the State Council according to the information office's working procedures.

The students expressed their gratitude for this.

The official from the Central Office and State Council Office Information Office said that regarding some of the issues raised by students in the "petition," the State Council spokesperson, Yuan Mu, gave very clear opinions this morning when answering questions from Chinese and foreign reporters. The Party Central Committee and the State Council are genuinely welcoming the students' request for dialogue. In fact, relevant departments have been actively engaging in dialogue with the students and will continue to do so with a sincere attitude. However, if dialogue on one side sets a series of preconditions, then such dialogue does not conform to the principle of mutual trust, and such dialogue may not be conducive to solving problems. This official hopes that the students will seriously consider this issue to strengthen unity.

It is also learned that today at noon, the officials from the National People's Congress Standing Committee Office Information Office have been waiting for the three students who submitted the "petition" to them yesterday, but these students did not come.

　　中办国办信访局答复    
    首都学生“请愿书”已送达
    新华社北京５月３日电  首都高校的几名学生今天中午来到中共中央办公厅国务院办公厅信访局接待室，询问对他们昨天递交的“请愿书”的回答。中办国办信访局的两名负责人接待了这几名学生。
    信访局负责人说，学生们通过信访部门递交的“请愿书”，他们已经按照信访部门的工作程序及时转交了党中央和国务院。
    对此，学生们表示感谢。
    中办国办信访局负责人说，对于一些学生在“请愿书”中提出的问题，国务院发言人袁木今天上午在答中外记者问时已发表了很明确的意见。学生们要求对话，党中央、国务院是抱真诚欢迎态度的。事实上，有关部门早已在和学生积极对话，并将继续以真诚的态度和广大同学对话。但是，如果对话的某一方面提出一系列先决条件，那么这种对话是不符合相互信任的原则的，这样的对话恐怕也不利于解决问题。这位负责人希望同学们认真地思考一下这个问题，以利于增强团结。
    另悉，今天中午全国人大常委会办公厅信访局的负责同志一直在等候昨天向他们递交“请愿书”的三位学生，但这几位学生没有到来。
