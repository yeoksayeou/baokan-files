That year, after graduating from high school, I returned to my hometown to work in agriculture. My heart felt empty. The educated youth, Wu Jun, was a very kind person and we got along well. One day, while cutting the early rice, I suddenly heard Wu Jun exclaim "Ouch!" at the same time, there was a flapping sound. It turned out that a wounded gray pigeon was nesting on the edge of the dike. Wu Jun was startled, and his left hand was cut by the sickle. I raised the sickle to chop off the head of this "culprit," but Wu Jun snatched the pigeon and carefully removed the bandage from its injured leg. He found a small piece of cloth tied to its leg with the words "Ning 68" barely visible. Wu Jun was overjoyed: "It's a carrier pigeon from Nanjing, and it's from my hometown too." He took the gray pigeon home, calling it "Lingli," and carefully cleaned its wound and applied medicine. A few days later, "Lingli" recovered, but it circled the tree in front of the educated youth's house three times and did not want to leave. Wu Jun stroked the pigeon and said, "Do you want to stay here with me?" "Lingli" looked at the newly built educated youth's house with its blue eyes, suddenly flew into the house, and refused to come out.

From then on, we had another friend.

The long days passed one by one. "Lingli" became more and more playful. One day, the two of us and the pigeon played together. Wu Jun asked, "'Lingli,' do you miss home?" "Lingli" looked at Wu Jun and cooed three times. Wu Jun said, "It says it misses its mother." He then asked, "'Lingli,' when can we go back to Nanjing?" After a moment of silence, "Lingli" cooed softly three more times. Wu Jun smiled, "Soon!"

The days passed heavily and bitterly. Our shoulders were rubbed raw and then healed again; the calluses on our hands had long proven our "great potential." In the morning, to sleep for half a cigarette's time, we didn't brush our teeth for an entire busy season. The hoe handle propped up in the field, making the sun lean crookedly. Wu Jun also developed a liking for "the cup's contents," often drinking alone until he was drunk, and gradually became indifferent to "Lingli."

One winter evening, the early north wind blew away the sun, and the whole alley was cold and desolate. In the darkness, I vaguely heard "Lingli" calling, pitifully. I put on a broken coat and walked over. A dim lamp flickered with loneliness. Wu Jun sat alone at the table, his eyes red. I asked what was wrong, and he pushed a letter from home towards me. It turned out he had asked his family for a few yuan to buy some salt, but his old mother sent a letter with nothing written on it, only wrapping two fen coins inside… My heart also ached. The darkness outside grew thicker, and the north wind grew stronger. "Lingli" cooed, close yet distant. A shiver startled me, and Wu Jun suddenly said, "Let's have a drink tonight, my dish, your wine, what do you say?" "Your dish?" "Don't ask, just go find the wine!" I searched half the village in confusion and finally found two bottles of homemade liquor. As soon as I stepped over the threshold, I was stunned! The house was filled with the cooing of pigeons, warm, sad, surprised, and thoughtful, all rushing towards me, then wrapping around me, pushing me. Finally, they suddenly disappeared, leaving no trace, only the empty, desolate educated youth's house in the darkness...

I buried "Lingli's" remains in the cold north wind in front of the educated youth's house. Wu Jun leaned drunkenly against the crooked educated youth's tree. From the thick darkness, looking at this twisted "person," I clenched my fists and reached towards the night sky...

　　鸽宴
    陈振学
    那年我高中毕业回乡务农，心里空落落的，知青吴君，人极温厚，与我颇为投合。一日割早稻，忽听前面的吴君“哎哟”一声，同时有扑腾声，原来田埂边孵着一只受伤的灰鸽。吴君一惊，左手被锯镰拉了条血口子。我举着锯镰要把这一“肇事”者的头“下”了，吴君抢过鸽子，小心地揭开它的伤腿，发现它腿上拴个小布条，上面模糊着“宁６８”字样。吴君高兴极了：“是只信鸽，从南京飞来的，还是我的老乡呢。”他把灰鸽带回家，唤它“伶俐”，极细心地为它洗尽伤口，涂上药水。几天后“伶俐”伤愈，却在知青屋前绕树三匝，不肯离去。吴君抚鸽低语：“你愿意和我一起在这里插队吗？”“伶俐”的蓝眼睛定定地看看新盖的知青屋，突然扑腾进屋里，再不肯出来。
    从此我们又多了一位朋友。
    长长的日子一天天过去，“伶俐”越来越逗人。一日，两人一鸽嬉戏。吴兄问：“‘伶俐’，你想不想家？”“伶俐”看看吴兄，咕咕咕连叫三声。吴兄说：“它说好想妈妈。”又问：“‘伶俐’，我们什么时候能回南京？”静场些许，“伶俐”低低地又咕三声。吴兄咧咧嘴，“快啦！”
    日脚一页一页翻着沉重和辛酸。我们的肩磨破了，又长出了新肉；手上的老茧，早就证明了“大有作为”。早上为了多睡半支烟功夫，一个忙季没刷过一回牙，锄头杆撑在地里，把个太阳撑得歪歪斜斜。吴君还爱上了“杯中物”，时时一个人灌得酩酊大醉，对“伶俐”则日见淡薄。
    冬天的一个晚上，小北风早早地吹跑了太阳，满巷子的肃杀、寒冷。黑暗中我隐隐听到“伶俐”的叫唤，凄切切的。我披件破大衣走过去，一灯如豆，摇曳着寂寞。吴君眼圈红红的独坐桌前。问何故，他把一封家信推过来。原来他跟家里要几块钱买点咸盐，老母亲来信，白纸不着一字，仅包了二分硬币……我心里也酸楚楚的。窗外黑暗愈浓，北风愈紧，“伶俐”咕了一声，极近又极远。一个哆嗦惊起，吴君突然说：“我们今晚来干一杯，我的菜，你的酒，如何？”“你的菜？”“你甭问，快去找酒！”疑疑惑惑找了半边村子，终于寻来两瓶土烧。一踏进门槛，我惊呆了！那满屋子咕咕咕的鸽鸣，热烈的、哀伤的、惊喜的、忧思的，一齐向我扑过来，然后裹缠着我，推搡着我。终于倏然而去，无踪无迹，只留下充满黑暗的、空空荡荡的知青屋……
    摸着硬硬的北风把“伶俐”的骨骸埋在知青屋前，吴君醉倚在斜歪的知青树上。从浓厚的黑暗中看着这扭歪的“人”字，我握紧双拳伸向夜空……
