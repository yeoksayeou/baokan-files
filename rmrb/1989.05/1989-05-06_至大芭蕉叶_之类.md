Title: On the Matter of "The Biggest Leaf is the Banana Leaf"

Chinese people generally pay great attention to the details of their children's words and actions.

Of course, the most important thing is that speech should be appropriate to one's status. In the northern part of Guangxi, in Beihai, there is a story called "The Biggest Leaf is the Banana Leaf." In ancient times, a certain official's household had a somewhat foolish servant who was good at work. The only thing that annoyed the master was that the servant was naturally honest and would correct the master's words immediately, regardless of the situation. One day, the master was welcoming a guest and told the servant in advance to keep quiet and act like a mute. After the guest arrived, during the conversation, they started discussing which leaf is the biggest. They argued back and forth, always stuck on lotus leaves and taro leaves. The servant could no longer bear it and shouted, "The biggest leaf is the banana leaf!"

The servant spoke the truth but lost his job.

Chinese proverbs are particularly numerous, and many "unworthy traditions" have also formed stubborn formats, often becoming popular once they are established.

In fact, many great achievements throughout history have been accomplished by people who dare to speak the truth. However, to this day, people still do not like those who say "The biggest leaf is the banana leaf." Speaking beyond one's status is often associated with "arrogance," while speaking within one's status is synonymous with "humility," and humility is the first virtue of the descendants of Yan and Huang.

Those who dislike "The biggest leaf is the banana leaf" are mostly officials or leaders. The reason is twofold: one is the old idea of seniority, and the other is the lack of democratic spirit.

The dispute over the size of the banana leaf is, after all, just a matter of common sense, whether or not it is said does not affect the national economy and people's livelihood. If this attitude is taken towards national affairs, it would be quite inappropriate.

### “至大芭蕉叶”之类

　　“至大芭蕉叶”之类
    郭宗阳
    中国人对子女，一言一行，大都注重细节的完美。
    当然，头等紧要的是，说话需符合身份。广西北海一带有个故事叫“至大芭蕉叶”。古时某官绅家，有一位傻乎乎的仆人干活还好。唯一使主人着恼的，是仆人天性耿直，不分场合，只要主人说得不对路，便马上插嘴纠正。一天主人欢迎贵宾，预先让他闭嘴装哑巴。客人到后，畅叙中，“侃”起什么叶子最大来了。争来争去，总在荷叶芋叶上打转。那仆人听得实在难忍，便大声道：“至大莫如芭蕉叶！”
    仆人说出了真理但丢了饭碗。
    中国人的古训特别多，许多并不“优良的传统”也形成了顽固的格式，往往一成格式便受世俗推崇。
    其实古往今来许多伟业雄绩多是由敢说实话的人做成的，但至今人们依然不喜有人说“至大芭蕉叶”。说话超越身份则与“狂妄”为伍，符合身份则与“谦虚”同义，而谦虚是炎黄子孙的第一美德。
    讨厌“至大芭蕉叶”者，大多是什么官什么长的。究其原因，一是有论资排辈的旧意识，二是缺乏民主作风。
    芭蕉叶大小之争议，毕竟只是常识问题，说不说都无碍国计民生，若对待国家大事也持这种态度，那就十分不妥了。
