Facing Challenges, Seeking Transformation
— The Current State and Prospects of Labor Union Movements in Europe and America
Chen Bolin

After experiencing more than a century of development, labor union movements in Europe and America are currently facing very severe challenges. An increasing number of unions have realized that, under modern economic and social conditions, traditional industrial actions are not only ineffective but also easily provoke widespread social dissatisfaction, leading to isolation. They believe that union struggles must be based on reality to protect workers' current rights and interests, while also actively participating in decision-making from the enterprise to the national level to improve working conditions. Reversing the trend of declining membership and developing new members has become the top priority for unions.

Over the past century, labor union movements in various European and American countries have undergone a long journey and have finally developed into an important political and social force. However, they are now facing very severe challenges. Whether unions will continue to decline or seek new paths through transformation has attracted attention.

Two Sharp Swords

In recent years, the economies of various European and American countries have shifted from sustained stagflation to low-speed development, with the economic growth rate for the year being slightly higher than 3.5%. Except for a few countries like the UK, the US, West Germany, and Switzerland, where unemployment rates have slightly decreased, other countries have seen high and persistent unemployment. In 1988, the unemployment rates in the Netherlands and Spain exceeded 15% and 20%, respectively. Unemployment hangs like a sword over the heads of workers in various countries.

At the same time, new technologies are rapidly developing, new materials and new energy sources are being widely adopted, and new industries are rapidly emerging. Traditional industries like steel and textiles are relatively declining, and robots and automation are increasingly replacing manual labor. Under these circumstances, the industrial structure has undergone significant changes, and a large number of workers have been eliminated. Coupled with some countries adopting economic austerity policies, the unemployment problem has become even more acute, leading to a significant reduction in union membership. Between 1985 and 1986, the union membership rate in the UK dropped from 48% to 45%, in France from 21.6% to 17%, in West Germany from 35% to 32.3%, and in Spain from 10% to 5%. In the US, the rate dropped from 34% in 1955 to 16.8% in 1988, with a continuing downward trend. This is another sharp sword piercing the hearts of union organizations in various countries, causing union leaders to be deeply concerned.

Due to the severe confrontation between management and the government on one side and unions on the other, the social conditions for the survival and activities of unions are deteriorating. In years of economic difficulty, unions are forced to choose between keeping their jobs and lowering wages, constantly retreating in the face of management, and workers often face suppression when they rise up to fight. In 1981, Reagan ordered the dismissal of more than 10,000 air traffic controllers who went on strike demanding wage increases, and disbanded their union. In 1985, the Thatcher government suppressed the British coal miners' strike. These two incidents are relatively prominent examples. Additionally, some unions themselves have problems such as bureaucratism and corruption, leading to a deteriorating image of unions and a general decline in members' trust. Many countries have seen discussions about "the demise of unions" and "moving towards a society without unions," causing serious concern and unease among union leaders in various countries.

Hope Lies Ahead

Currently, an increasing number of unions have realized that, under modern economic and social conditions, traditional industrial actions (such as slowdowns, strikes, and other picketing actions) are not only ineffective but also easily provoke widespread social dissatisfaction, leading to isolation. Moreover, workers' living and working conditions, welfare benefits, and democratic rights are all constrained and influenced by national policies, laws, and enterprise management goals and policies. Unions can only effectively protect the rights of their members by directly participating in decision-making at all levels.

Now, unions in many European and American countries not only participate in the management of workshops and factories and in the decision-making of companies and enterprises but also attempt to participate in the formulation of national and regional economic and social strategic policies and overall plans. This is to play a role in consulting, negotiating, coordinating, and supervising economic and social development. The American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO) has long suggested that the government, labor, and management should cooperate to establish a "National Industrial Revitalization Committee" to jointly formulate policies for rebuilding American industry and revitalizing the American economy. The German Trade Union Federation has reached an agreement with the government to promote worker participation in decision-making across all member states of the European Community. Recently, a conference attended by government, union, and social democratic party leaders from the European Community and the European Free Trade Association countries clearly stated that achieving a united European economy requires the participation of workers and their organizations.

Currently, unions in various countries are gradually strengthening their research on the economy and society of their own countries and regions. Union struggles start from reality to protect workers' current rights and interests, shifting from demanding wage increases to focusing on job security and reducing working hours. They also actively participate in decision-making from the central to the enterprise level, from improving working conditions to demanding nuclear disarmament and environmental protection. Facing the rapid development of the technological revolution, unions demand participation in the entire process of adopting and promoting new technologies to mitigate and eliminate the negative impact of new technologies on workers. In addition to urging and assisting the government and employers to provide vocational training, unions themselves also vigorously organize technical training classes to provide conditions for unemployed workers and those preparing to change careers to learn new technologies, facilitating future employment. The functions of unions in various European and American countries are undergoing a profound transformation, and this transformation is where the hope for unions lies.

The Urgent Task

Reversing the trend of declining membership and developing new members has become the top priority for unions in various European and American countries. The International Federation of Free Trade Unions has raised this issue to the level of determining the future of unions. The AFL-CIO has established a "Work Expansion Committee" and equipped it with a powerful think tank composed of professors and experts from renowned institutions such as Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The committee emphasizes the need to adopt diversified working methods to meet the different needs and wishes of various members. Unions in the UK, France, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and Finland all pay great attention to the work of retired workers, viewing them as an important force. As for the numerous female workers, young workers, service industry workers, as well as technical, administrative, and managerial personnel, they are all active targets for unions in various countries. The Italian Labor Federation even advocates for the establishment of "citizen unions" to include everyone.

To attract workers, unions in various countries pay attention to providing more services to members, such as establishing banks, cooperatives, insurance businesses, holiday villages, recreational centers, nurseries, nursing homes, vocational training schools, and more. The slogan of the European Trade Union Confederation is that unions must find new methods and means to attract more workers.

Facing severe challenges, the labor union movements in Europe and America can only overcome difficulties and continue to progress by insisting on transformation, adapting to the tide of the times, and better serving workers.

　　面临挑战　寻求变革    
    ——欧美工会运动现状和前景
    陈伯霖
    内容提要经历了一个多世纪历程的欧美工会运动，目前正面临着十分严峻的挑战。越来越多的工会认识到，在现代经济社会条件下，传统的产业行动不但难以奏效，反而容易招致社会的普遍不满，使自己陷于孤立。他们认为工会斗争既要从实际出发，维护工人的当前权益，又要积极参与从企业到国家的决策，争取改善劳动条件。而扭转会员率下降的趋势、发展新会员已成为工会的头等大事。
    百余年来，欧美各国工会运动经过漫长的历程，终于发展成为一支重要的政治和社会力量，但是，目前都面临十分严峻的挑战。工会继续衰落，还是从变革中寻求新的出路，已引起人们的关注。
    　　　　两把利剑
    几年来，欧美各国经济由持续滞胀，走向低速发展，去年经济年平均增长率略高于３．５％。除英、美、西德、瑞士等少数国家失业率有所下降外，其他国家都居高不下。１９８８年荷兰和西班牙失业率分别超过１５％和２０％。失业像一把利剑悬在各国工人的头上。
    同时，新科技不断发展，新材料和新能源被广泛采用，新兴工业迅速崛起，钢铁、纺织等传统工业相对衰落，机器人和自动化日益取代体力劳动。在此情况下，产业结构发生巨大变化，大批工人被淘汰；再加上一些国家采取经济紧缩政策，失业问题更加尖锐，工会会员大幅度减少。１９８５—１９８６年，英国工会会员率从４８％降到４５％，法国从２１．６％降到１７％，西德从３５％降到３２．３％，西班牙从１０％降到５％。美国由１９５５年的３４％，下降到１９８８年的１６．８％，还有进一步下降的趋势。这是插在各国工会组织的又一把利剑，对此工会领导人忧心忡忡。
    由于资方和政府与工会严重对立，工会生存和活动的社会条件不断恶化。在经济困难的年头，工会被迫在保住职业和压低工资之间作出抉择，向资方节节退让，工人一旦起来斗争往往遭到镇压。１９８１年，里根下令解雇１万多名因要求增加工资而举行罢工的机场塔台指挥人员，并且解散了他们的工会。１９８５年，撒切尔政府平息英国煤矿工人大罢工。这两起事件是较为突出的例子。此外，有的工会本身也存在着一些弊病，如官僚作风、贪污受贿等，工会的形象日益不佳，会员群众对工会的信任普遍下降。许多国家相继出现“工会消亡”、“向没有工会的社会迈进”等论调，引起各国工会领导人的严重关切和不安。
    　　　　希望所在
    目前，越来越多的工会认识到，在现代经济社会条件下，传统的产业行动（怠工、罢工和其他纠察行动）不但难以奏效，反而容易招致社会的普遍不满，使自己陷于孤立。何况，工人的生活和工作条件、福利待遇和民主权利等等都是受国家有关政策法令及企业经营目标和管理方针制约和影响的，工会只有直接参与各级的决策，方能有成效地维护会员的权益。
    现在，许多欧美国家工会不仅已参与车间、工厂一级的管理及公司企业的决策，而且还试图参与国家和地区经济社会战略方针和总体规划的制订，以便在经济和社会发展中起咨询、磋商、协调和监督的作用。美国劳联—产联早就建议：政府、劳、资三方合作，成立“全国工业重振委员会”，共同制订重建美国工业、振兴美国经济的方针。西德工联与政府达成协议，要把工人参决制推向欧洲共同体所有国家。前不久，欧共体和自由贸易区国家政府、工会和社会党等政党主要领导人参加的关于欧洲工人运动作用的国际会议明确表示，实现联合的欧洲经济利益必须通过职工及其组织的参与。
    目前，各国工会都逐渐加强对本国和本地区经济和社会的调查研究。工会斗争既从实际出发维护工人的当前权益，由要求增加工资，转为重点保障就业，争取缩短工时，又积极参与从中央到企业的决策、从争取改善劳动条件，到要求核裁军和保护生态环境。面对科技革命的迅速发展，工会要求参与新技术采用和推广的全部过程，以减轻和消除新技术对工人的消极影响。工会除了督促并协助政府和雇主办好职业技术培训外，自己也大力举办技术训练班，为失业工人和准备改行的工人提供学习新技术的条件，以利将来就业。欧美各国工会的职能正在经历着一场深刻的变革，而变革正是工会希望之所在。
    　　　　当务之急
    扭转会员率下降趋势，发展新会员已成为欧美各国工会当前的头等大事。国际自由工联把这个问题提高到决定工会未来命运的高度来认识。美国劳联—产联专门成立了一个“开展工作委员会”，并且配备有一个由哈佛大学、麻省理工学院等著名院校的教授、专家等组成的强有力的智囊团。该会强调，必须采用多样化的工作方法，去满足各类会员的不同需要和愿望。英、法、葡、西、比、芬等国工会都十分重视退休工人的工作，把他们视为一支重要的力量。至于为数众多的女工、青工、服务业工人，以及科技、行政、管理人员更是各国工会积极争取的对象。意大利劳盟甚至主张成立“市民工会”，把所有的人都纳入工会。
    为了吸引工人，各国工会都注意向会员提供更多的服务，如创办银行、合作社、保险业务、度假村、康乐中心、托儿所、养老院、职业培训学校等等。欧洲工联的口号是，工会必须寻找新的方法和手段，使工会对更多的工人产生吸引力。
    面临严峻挑战的欧美工会运动，只有坚持变革，顺应时代潮流，更好地为工人服务，才能克服重重困难，继续前进。
