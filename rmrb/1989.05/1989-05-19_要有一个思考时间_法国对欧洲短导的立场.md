There Needs to Be a Time for Reflection
— France's Stance on European Short-Range Missiles

By Zhang Qihua, Our Correspondent

The dispute over European short-range missiles has been ongoing, and what is France's stance on this issue? On May 18, President Mitterrand, in response to a reporter's question, made a comprehensive and open statement.

Mitterrand said that the dispute over short-range missiles is a disagreement between the United States, Britain, and West Germany. France is not a member of NATO's military integration, and it does not want to "get involved" in this debate but only wants to express its own views. From now until 1992, there is enough time for reflection. France advocates first discussing the reduction of conventional weapons in Europe and then making a decision on short-range missiles based on the results. However, President Mitterrand asserted, "The time to declare the cancellation of the third zero option for U.S.-Soviet short-range missiles in Europe is still far away." This statement clarifies France's position.

French public opinion believes that France has long maintained "silence" on this issue, unwilling to publicly intervene, because on the one hand, France believes that Britain's advocacy for the modernization of short-range missiles "is not without reason," and on the other hand, it also disagrees with West Germany's use of easing the overall process as a bargaining chip. However, as the debate within NATO deepens, especially with the Soviet Union launching a new disarmament offensive, unilaterally withdrawing 500 tactical missiles deployed in Eastern Europe, and warning of possible partial cancellation of the intermediate-range missile treaty in retaliation for NATO's plans to modernize short-range missiles, and even threatening to include France and Britain's short-range missiles in the negotiations. In this situation, France has reached the time to clarify its position.

Regarding President Mitterrand's statement at yesterday's press conference, one view in Paris is that "France has stood on the side of West Germany." *Libération* wrote that Mitterrand's proposal to delay the decision for three years is "adding water to the West German millstone," which objectively helps to ease the tension within NATO and may gain the approval of other countries. France's proposal to link it with the reduction of conventional weapons also considers the concerns of many people on this issue.

Fundamentally, France's stance is consistent with its long-standing policy of "nuclear deterrence strategy." France itself is working to update its short-range missiles, and it has no interest in the "third zero option." Even Chirac, who criticizes Mitterrand's "wait-and-see" attitude towards the modernization of European short-range missiles, cannot object to this. Last night, Chirac said on television that France's security and Europe's security are inseparable, and nuclear weapons have been and will continue to be a guarantee of peace in Europe.

On May 20, Mitterrand will visit the United States, and the agenda will surely include the issue of short-range missiles. Whether the United States is willing to show flexibility in the schedule for updating short-range missiles will directly affect the progress of this debate.

### “要有一个思考时间”——法国对欧洲短导的立场

　　“要有一个思考时间”   
    ——法国对欧洲短导的立场
    本报记者  张启华
    欧洲短导之争日久，法国对此持何态度？５月１８日，密特朗总统在回答记者提问时，全面、公开地作出了表态。
    密特朗说，短导之争是美国、英国、西德之间的分歧，法国不是北约军事一体化成员，它不想“搅到”这场辩论中去，而只想发表自己的看法。从现在至１９９２年，人们有足够时间思考。法国主张先讨论欧洲常规武器的裁减，然后再视结果就短导作出决定。不过，密特朗总统断言，“宣告取消美苏在欧洲短导的第三个零点方案的时刻远远没有到来。”这一表态，表明了法国的立场。
    法国舆论认为，法国长期来对此表示“沉默”，不愿公开介入，是因为一方面法国认为英国力主短导现代化“并非没有理由”，另一方面也对西德“以缓和总进程作为抵押”有异议。但是，随着北约内部辩论的深入，特别是苏联掀起新的裁军攻势，单方面撤除部署在东欧的５００战术导弹，并警告可能用部分取消中导条约来报复北约对短导现代化的计划，还扬言要把法、英的短导列入谈判范围。在这种情况下，法国到了澄清立场的时候了。
    对于密特朗总统昨天在记者会上的表态，巴黎舆论的一种看法是，“法国站到了西德一边”。《解放报》写道，密特朗关于推迟３年再作决定，是在“西德的磨石上加水”，客观上有助于缓冲北约内部的紧张气氛，因而可能取得其它国家的赞许。法国提出的与常规武器裁减的“挂钩”建议，也照顾了许多人对这个问题的关切。
    从根本上看，法国的这一立场，同它一贯奉行的“核威慑战略”是一致的。法国自己在努力更新它的短程导弹，它对“第三个零点方案”并无兴趣。就连批评密特朗对欧洲短导现代化采取“等待”态度的希拉克对此也无法提出异议。昨晚，希拉克在电视上说，法国的安全与欧洲的安全是不可分的，核武器在过去、现在都是欧洲和平的保障。
    ５月２０日，密特朗访美，议题之中必有短导问题。美国是否愿意在更新短导问题的日程上表现出灵活性，将直接影响这场辩论的进程。
