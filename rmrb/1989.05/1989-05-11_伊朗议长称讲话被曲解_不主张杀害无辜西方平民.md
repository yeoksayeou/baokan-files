Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, May 10th.

Iranian Parliament Speaker Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani today stated that he did not advocate for Palestinians to kill innocent Western civilians.

In an interview with Tehran Radio, Rafsanjani said, "I do not advocate for others to do such things." He explained that the original meaning of his speech a few days ago had been misinterpreted.

According to reports, on May 5th, Rafsanjani called for Palestinians to kill Americans, British, French, and to blow up their factories and hijack their planes in retaliation for Israel's killing of Palestinians. His remarks sparked strong reactions in the Western world.

Regarding the aforementioned reports, Rafsanjani said that the Western countries' quoting of his supposed statements were not his exact words. At the same time, he again condemned Western countries, saying that their support for Israel in killing Palestinians was state terrorism.

Rafsanjani said that Israel's atrocities would ultimately provoke Palestinian retaliation.

　　伊朗议长称讲话被曲解  不主张杀害无辜西方平民
    新华社德黑兰５月１０日电  伊朗议会议长拉夫桑贾尼今天表示，他并没有主张巴勒斯坦人去杀害无辜的西方平民。
    在接受德黑兰电台采访时，拉夫桑贾尼说：“我并不主张别人做这种事。”他说，他的前几天的一次讲话的原义被曲解了。
    据报道，拉夫桑贾尼５月５日在德黑兰大学的一次祈祷会上号召巴勒斯坦人杀死美国人、英国人、法国人和炸毁他们工厂、劫持他们飞机，作为对以色列杀害巴勒斯坦人的报复。他的这一讲话引起了西方世界的强烈反响。
    对于上述这些报道，拉夫桑贾尼说，西方国家转引所谓他说过的那些话并不是他的原话。同时，他再次谴责西方国家说，它们支持以色列杀害巴勒斯坦人是搞国家恐怖主义。
    拉夫桑贾尼说，以色列的暴行将最终引起巴勒斯坦人的报复。
