Title: Yu Guangyuan on: Philosophy is not the same as the study of cleverness

Yu Guangyuan wrote in the second issue of this year's "Method" magazine that there is a view that philosophy is the study of cleverness, making people clever. It can also be said that philosophy is the study of cleverness. I think this view has some truth to it, but it is not entirely accurate. Because philosophy and the study of cleverness each have their own scope, they are ultimately different concepts. For example, in terms of the scope of philosophy, it includes very important components such as the exploration of the essence of the universe (ontology). Discussing these issues deeply and clearly can certainly have a positive effect on making a person more clever. However, it cannot be said that discussions about whether time and space are finite or infinite fall within the scope of studying cleverness or the purpose of making people clever. In terms of the scope of the study of cleverness, for example, it includes exploring how to act cleverly in various types of work and life. This research, although within the scope of methodology, examines problems in specific objects and does not belong to philosophy. Based on the above, the relationship between philosophy and the study of cleverness can be seen as intersecting disciplines, but the intersection here is not between two disciplines of equal status.

　　于光远谈：
    哲学不等于聪明学
    于光远在今年第二期《方法》杂志上撰文说：有一种说法，哲学就是研究聪明、使人聪明的学问。也可以说，哲学就是聪明学。我认为这个说法有对的地方，但又不尽然。因为哲学和聪明学各有自己的外延，它们终究是不同的概念。就哲学的外延来说，比方说，它包括像探讨宇宙的本体（即本体论）这样一个非常重要的组成部分。把这方面问题讨论得深刻，讨论得比较清楚，对于一个人变得更聪明些，当然可以起到积极的作用。但是总不能说关于时间空间有限性还是无限性的讨论属于研究聪明，或目的是为了使人聪明的范围。就聪明学的外延来说，比方说，它包括像探讨在各种类型工作和生活中如何聪明地行事的问题。这种研究虽然属于方法论的范围，但这种研究所考察的是具体对象中的问题，不属于哲学。根据上面所说，哲学与聪明学的关系可以视作互相交叉的学科，不过在这里的交叉不是地位平等的两门学科的交叉。
