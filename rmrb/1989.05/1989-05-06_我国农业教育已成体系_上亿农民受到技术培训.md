Over the past 10 years, China has gradually established a system of agricultural education for cadres at all levels and a system of technical education for farmers.

According to materials provided at the National Conference on Agricultural Adult Education, which opened today, the country has trained more than 20,000 county and bureau-level party and government leaders responsible for agriculture, as well as more than 1 million leaders and managers at the township (district, county bureau) level in the agricultural system. Additionally, 140 million farmers, grassroots cadres in rural areas, and township enterprise workers have received various technical trainings. More than half of the villages in the country have established agricultural technical education venues, and radio, television, and other forms of distance education have reached every household in rural areas.

However, Minister of Agriculture He Kang pointed out that the development of agricultural adult education in China is still very uneven. He said, "The 'Four Modernizations' must first modernize people. If the quality of farmers does not improve, agricultural modernization cannot be achieved." Currently, grain production has stagnated for four consecutive years, and agricultural development lacks momentum. To solve this problem, in addition to the central government formulating corresponding policies and increasing necessary investments, it is necessary to quickly improve the quality of agricultural cadres, technical personnel, farmers, and workers, and implement "Science and Technology for Agricultural Development."

　　我国农业教育已成体系    
    上亿农民受到技术培训
    本报北京５月６日讯  记者蒋建科报道：１０年来，我国逐步建成了各级农业干部教育体系和农民技术教育体系。
    据今天开幕的全国农业成人教育工作会议提供的资料，全国已培训县处级主管农业的党政领导干部和农业系统的领导干部２万余名；各省、区、市还培训了乡镇（科、县局）级领导管理干部１００余万名；另有１．４亿农民、农村基层干部、乡镇企业职工接受了各种技术培训。全国半数以上的村设立了农民技术教育场所，广播、电视等远距离教育已延伸到农村的千家万户。
    但是，农业部长何康指出，我国农业成人教育的发展还很不平衡。他说，“四化”要先“化”人，农民素质不提高，就无法实现农业现代化。当前，粮食产量连续４年徘徊不前，农业发展后劲不足，解决这个问题的出路，除中央要制定相应的政策，增加必要的投入外，必须尽快提高农业干部、科技人员、农民、职工的素质，实行“科技兴农”。
