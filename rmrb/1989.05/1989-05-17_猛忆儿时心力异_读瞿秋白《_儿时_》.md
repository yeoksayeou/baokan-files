In the early 1930s, Qu Qiubai in Shanghai became close friends with Lu Xun, treating each other as brothers. During their joint struggle, they collaborated on 14 essays. Most of these essays were written by Qu Qiubai in Lu Xun's style, slightly revised by Lu Xun, and published under Lu Xun's name. Lu Xun also included 13 of these essays in his own collection of essays. However, one essay, "Childhood," although published under Lu Xun's pen name on December 15, 1933, in the *Shanghai Morning Post's Free Talk*, was not included in Lu Xun's essay collection. The tone of this article is also quite unique, differing significantly from other essays of the same period. This has attracted the attention and discussion of scholars.

"Childhood" is a deeply emotional, beautifully written, and thought-provoking short essay. The author begins with the lines from Gong Ding'an's poem: "Suddenly remembering childhood, the heart's strength is different; a single lamp's red light leads to the boundless past." Obviously, this essay expresses the author's reflections on life. Qu Qiubai is open-hearted and has a strong sense of self-reflection. His reflections on life are naturally sincere. He says: "Life is only once, and it is precious to everyone. However, if one's life is merged into the collective, if one works for the world every day, then one is always growing, although aging, illness, and death are inevitable, one's work—the work of the masses—is eternal. One will experience 'eternal youth.' But those who live 'life as a dream,' taking much from the world but giving little back, will one day feel the weariness of death." This is the self-description of a communist warrior. Therefore, Yang Zhihua says: "In the article 'Childhood' written at that time, Qu Qiubai profoundly explains: in these extraordinary three years, why he could continue as before, still with such astonishing 'great energy,' like 'eternal youth,' dedicating himself to the party's cause?" Why did Qu Qiubai write about "childhood"? There must be other reasons and thoughts. He says: "When one cannot move forward, one wants to retreat a few steps, to restore the path already traveled." Thus, he "remembers" and "prays" for the "ignorant" "childhood." With a conflicting and self-reproaching heart, he sighs: "Terrible, this 'stopping' of life." This was Qu Qiubai's true voice at that time. Later, in *Extra Words*, he also talked about his painful state of mind during this period and exaggeratedly said that his "political life had actually ended." This needs to be understood from his environment at the time. After being forced to leave his central leadership position, he braved hardships and illness to engage in revolutionary cultural work. However, the temporary Central Political Bureau, controlled by Wang Ming's "Left" line, seized on his article signed "Di Kang" in the *Struggle* magazine, once again persecuting him. On September 22, 1933, they issued the *Central Decision on the Errors of Comrade Di Kang (Qu Qiubai)*, calling on the entire party to wage "the most ruthless struggle" against him. "Childhood" was written six days later (September 28). At this time, Qu Qiubai was physically and mentally exhausted. He had doubts about the central policy at the time, but even the right to think and speak was taken away, leaving only the "right" to reflect. He thought that if he could not do anything more for the world, then the "sadness of aging and incompetence" would "weigh heavily on his heart like lead." Under such circumstances, he felt the "stopping" of life, the "decline" after "middle age," and thus wanted to "ask for 'ignorance' to return, to give me the joy of seeking knowledge." This is a wounded soul calling for the will to live in adversity.

This article is written with a self-reflective attitude, a gentle tone, and a mix of indignation and melancholy. The rich content, deep emotions, and profound thoughts in the article make one feel the authenticity of the soul and the beauty of the character. Since the thoughts and emotions, as well as the writing style of the article, are all Qu Qiubai's, it is understandable that Lu Xun did not include it in his own essay collection.

　　猛忆儿时心力异    
    ——读瞿秋白《“儿时”》
    冒炘
    ３０年代初期，瞿秋白在上海与鲁迅结为知己，视如同怀。他们在并肩战斗过程中还合作了１４篇杂文。这些杂文大都由瞿秋白仿照鲁迅笔调写的，经过鲁迅稍改，并以鲁迅笔名发表。鲁迅还将其中１３篇编进自己的杂文集中。唯有一篇《“儿时”》，虽是用鲁迅笔名子明于１９３３年１２月１５日《申报·自由谈》发表，但鲁迅没有收进自己的杂文集，而文章基调也很特殊，与同时期其它杂文迥异。因而引起了学者们的注意与议论。
    《“儿时”》是一篇感情真挚、文采优美而又具有较高思想价值的抒情小品。作者在文前引了“狂胪文献耗中年”的龚定庵诗句“猛忆儿时心力异，一灯红接混茫前”。显然，此文抒发的是人生的感慨。秋白襟怀坦白，富有自我解剖精神，他的人生感慨自然是真诚的。他说：“生命只有一次，对于谁都是宝贵的。但是，假使他的生命溶化在大众的里面，假使他天天在为这世界干些什么，那末，他总在生长，虽然衰老病死仍旧是逃避不了，然而他的事业——大众的事业是不死的。他会领略到‘永久的青年’。而‘浮生如梦’的人，从这世界里拿去的很多，而给这世界的却很少，——他总有一天会觉得疲乏的死亡。”这是一个共产主义战士的自述。所以，杨之华说：“秋白在当时写的《“儿时”》这篇文章意味深长地说明了：在这不寻常的三年中，他为什么能够一如既往，依然以如此惊人的‘伟大的精力’，像‘永久的青年’似的献身于党的事业？”秋白为什么要作“儿时”？一定还另有所感，另有所思。他说：“不能够前进的时候，就愿意退后几步，替自己恢复已经走过的前途。”于是，他“想念”和“祷告”“无知”的“儿时”。他怀着矛盾而又自责的心情叹息着：“可怕呵，这生命的‘停止’。”这是瞿秋白当时真实的心声。后来，在《多余的话》中，他也谈到在这个时期的痛苦心境，并过头地说他的“政治生命其实早已结束了”。这要从他那时的环境来理解。他在被迫离开中央领导岗位以后，不避艰险抱病从事革命文化工作，而王明“左”倾路线控制的临时中央政治局却抓住他在《斗争》杂志发表的署名“狄康”的文章，再一次摧残他，１９３３年９月２２日作出了《中央关于狄康（瞿秋白）同志错误的决定》，号召全党对他进行“最无情的斗争”。《“儿时”》就是在六天之后（９月２８日）写的。此时秋白身心交瘁，他对中央当时的政策有怀疑，但连思考和发言的权利都被剥夺了，只剩下检讨的“权利”。他想，如果不能给这世界再干些什么，那么“衰老和无能的悲哀”，将会“像铅一样地沉重，压在他的心头”。在这样的环境下面，他感到生命的“停止”，“中年”以后的“衰退”，因而要“请求‘无知’回来，给我求知的快乐。”这是一颗创伤的心灵在厄运中，对生命意志的呼唤。
    这篇文章是以自剖的态度，委婉的笔调，带点愤慨的而又惆怅的情绪写的。文中丰厚的内涵，醇郁的情味，深沉的思索，令人感到灵魂的真实和情操的优美。由于文章的思想感情与文字风格是瞿秋白所有，故而鲁迅没有收进自己的杂文集，便是可以理解的事情了。
