Jiangsu Institute of Technology's mechanical manufacturing department's heat treatment major student, Xú Yīng, a freshman of 1985, recently told a reporter, "There is too much to learn, and time is really not enough." According to Xú Yīng, this is the common feeling among students participating in the "two-period system" trial.

The so-called "two-period system" divides undergraduate education into three stages: the first stage, students spend two and a half years studying basic courses and technical foundation courses; the second stage, through mutual selection between students and employing units, students are pre-assigned to factories for one year of internship. During this period, the factory determines the student's future professional direction based on actual needs and the student's wishes and talents; the third stage, students return to school for another year of professional courses, and then conduct a half-year graduation design combined with the factory's production technology problems. Students who pass the graduation requirements will then go to work at that factory. The students under the "two-period system" have a four-year school system, but the actual study time is five years.

Jiangsu Institute of Technology has been conducting the "two-period system" trial in the mechanical manufacturing department's heat treatment major and casting major since 1987. Currently, the 1985 class students have returned from their factory internships, and the 1986 class students are currently interning in factories.

Both students and enterprises have positive feedback on this experiment. Some people say that this reform can better solve the problem of studying something that is not useful. In the past, students studied for four years in school, and the major they learned might be in short supply when they entered school but became a surplus major when they graduated, and some had to change careers. After implementing the "two-period system," the students' majors are determined according to the actual needs of the employing units, so that their majors match the job requirements, and learning is applied to practice. In this school's first batch of students participating in the trial, 2/3 changed the major they had determined when they entered school.

This year, in addition to continuing the "two-period system" in some surplus majors, Jiangsu Institute of Technology also plans to implement the recruitment of new students by major categories across the entire school, that is, to merge the school's 29 majors into 11 major categories. After new students are enrolled, they will not be immediately assigned to majors, but will be arranged to study basic courses and technical foundation courses by major categories. After two years, the professional direction will be determined according to social needs.

### 江苏工学院试行“两期制”  学一段干一段　厂校联合育人

　　江苏工学院试行“两期制”    
    学一段干一段　厂校联合育人
    据新华社南京５月７日电  （记者牟维旭）江苏工学院机械制造系热处理专业８５级女学生徐缨，最近在接受记者采访时说：“要学的东西太多了，时间真不够用。”据徐缨介绍，这是参加“两期制”试点的大学生们的普遍感觉。
    所谓“两期制”，就是把大学本科教育分成３个阶段：第一阶段，学生用２年半时间学习基础课和技术基础课；第二阶段，通过学生与用人单位“双向选择”，将学生预分到工厂实习一年，这个期间由工厂根据实际需要和学生本人的意愿及特长，确定其今后的专业方向；第三阶段，学生回校再学习一年专业课，然后结合工厂生产技术问题进行为期半年的毕业设计。学生成绩合格获准毕业后，即到那个厂子工作。实行“两期制”的学生学制为４年，但实际学习时间５年。
    江苏工学院从１９８７年起已连续两年在机械制造系热处理专业和铸造专业进行“两期制”试点。目前，８５级学生已从工厂实习回来，８６级学生正在工厂实习。
    对于这一试验，学生和企业都反映很好。一些人说，这一改革，可以较好地解决学非所用的问题。过去学生在校学习４年，所学专业很可能入学时是短线毕业时却变成了长线，有的不得不改行。实行“两期制”后，学生的专业都是按照用人单位的实际需要确定的，毕业后专业对口，学以致用。这个学校第一批参加试点的学生中，２／３改变了入学时确定的专业。
    今年，江苏工学院除继续在一些长线专业试行“两期制”外，还准备在全校推行按专业大类招收新生，即把学校２９个专业归并为１１大类。新生入学后不马上分专业，而是按专业大类安排基础课和技术基础课，２年后再根据社会需要确定专业方向。
