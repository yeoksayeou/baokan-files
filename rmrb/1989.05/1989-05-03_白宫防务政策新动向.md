Title: New Trends in White House Defense Policy

The Bush administration recently announced a "mixed deployment plan" centered around the MX multiple-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile and the mobile Midget missile. At a time when Bush is tightening military spending, the significant effort to update and expand land-based strategic nuclear weapons has made the White House's defense policy noteworthy.

The purpose of the "mixed deployment plan" is to deploy MX multiple-warhead missiles on orbital vehicles and to add Midget single-warhead missiles mounted on trucks, allowing the U.S.'s strategic nuclear weapons to largely evade the first strike of Soviet intercontinental nuclear missiles, thereby preserving sufficient nuclear retaliatory capability. This concept aligns with the traditional nuclear deterrence theory in U.S. nuclear strategy. At the same time, President Bush has reduced funding for Reagan's favored "Star Wars" Strategic Defense Initiative. As the Washington Post commented: Bush's plan shifts U.S. nuclear strategy from Reagan's emphasis on strategic defense back to the track of nuclear deterrence.

For 13 years, Congress and the Pentagon have been at odds over how to develop offensive nuclear weapons. The newly appointed President Bush, while insisting on the redeployment of MX multiple-warhead missiles, has adopted Congress's demand to deploy mobile Midget single-warhead missiles, thus reconciling and compromising between the two differing opinions. This is certainly aimed at coordinating future relations between the White House and Congress. Currently, Secretary of State Baker will discuss the resumption of the U.S.-Soviet strategic nuclear weapons limitation talks, which were suspended last November, during his visit to the Soviet Union this month. President Bush particularly hopes that the Democratic-majority Senate and House of Representatives will vote in favor of the White House's decision at that time. In the long term, President Bush obviously hopes to gain Congress's support on major domestic and foreign policy decisions by making this concession to Congress.

However, maintaining the "mixed deployment plan" comes at a cost. President Bush has decided to scale back the strategic defense plan and delay the production of B-2 stealth bombers, and is prepared to make cuts in conventional weapons and combat personnel. This "robbing Peter to pay Paul" approach indicates that the development of U.S. military power cannot escape the constraints of a massive fiscal deficit.

The current focus of public attention is whether the significant development of land-based long-range missiles will trigger a new round of the arms race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Although the "mixed deployment plan" matches the scale of the deployment planned during Reagan's term in terms of the number of warheads, the number of launch vehicles has broken through. More importantly, these mobile missiles will greatly enhance the U.S.'s deterrent capability. The U.S. has been trying to prevent the Soviet Union from deploying its SS-24 multiple-warhead mobile missiles because the U.S. considers these missiles to be "particularly threatening." So, if the "mixed deployment plan" can be implemented, how can the U.S. stop the SS-24 from coming into existence?

### 白宫防务政策新动向

　　白宫防务政策新动向
    景宪法
    布什政府最近公布了以ＭＸ多弹头洲际导弹和侏儒式机动导弹为主体的“混合部署方案”。布什总统在紧缩军费开支之时，花大气力更新并扩充陆基战略核武器，使白宫的防务政策出现了引人注目的动向。
    “混合部署方案”的目的，是通过部署运行在轨道车上的ＭＸ多弹头导弹和增设安放在卡车上的侏儒式单弹头导弹，使美国的战略核武器能够基本上躲过苏联洲际核导弹的第一次打击，从而保存足够的核报复能力。这种设想同美国核战略中传统的核威慑理论基本吻合。与此同时，布什总统削减了里根推崇的“星球大战”即战略防御计划的经费。正如《华盛顿邮报》评论指出：布什的方案使美国的核战略理论从里根重视的战略防御设想，“重新回到核威慑的轨道上”。
    在如何发展进攻性核武器的问题上，国会和五角大楼已争吵了１３年之久。新近走马上任的布什总统能够在坚持重新部署ＭＸ多弹头导弹的同时，采纳国会要求部署侏儒式单弹头机动导弹的主张，对两种不同意见作了调和与妥协，这当然是着眼于为今后协调白宫和国会之间的关系。从眼前来看，贝克国务卿将在本月访苏时磋商恢复去年１１月休会的美苏限制战略核武器谈判，布什总统尤其希望民主党人占多数的国会参众两院届时能对白宫的决策投赞成票。从长远来看，布什总统显然希望通过这次向国会作出让步，赢得国会今后在内政、外交等重大决策问题上鼎力相助。
    但是，维系这个“混合部署方案”必须付出代价。布什总统已决定压缩战略防务计划的规模和推迟生产Ｂ２隐形轰炸机，并且准备在常规武器和战斗人员方面作出裁减。这种“拆东墙、补西墙”的作法，表明美国发展军事力量不能不受到巨额财政赤字的掣肘。
    目前为舆论关注的问题，是这种陆基远程导弹的长足发展，是否会诱发美苏之间新的一轮武器竞赛。“混合部署方案”虽在核弹头的数量上和里根任期中准备发展的规模旗鼓相当，但就运载工具而言，其数量则有所突破。更为重要的是，这些机动导弹将大大提高美国的威慑能力。美国一直在设法阻止苏联部署它的ＳＳ—２４多弹头机动导弹，因为美国认为这种导弹“特别具有威胁性”。那么，既然“混合部署方案”可以诞生，美国又如何阻挡得住ＳＳ—２４的问世呢？
