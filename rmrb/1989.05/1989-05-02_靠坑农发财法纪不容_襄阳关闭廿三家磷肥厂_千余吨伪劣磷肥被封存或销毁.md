Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 2nd - To protect the economic interests of farmers, the Shanyang County People's Government, based on public reports, investigated and handled over 120 cases of counterfeit fertilizers and pesticides that harmed farmers. They also ordered the closure of 23 substandard phosphate fertilizer production plants, sealing up 220 tons of inferior phosphate fertilizer and destroying over 800 tons of fake phosphate fertilizer.

Since last year, with the widening gap in the supply of production materials, some lawless elements have taken advantage of the situation to illegally produce and sell fake and substandard fertilizers. In just three months from May to July last year, the number of small phosphate fertilizer production plants in Shanyang County increased by more than 20. These newly emerged plants include township enterprises, village-run enterprises, and even unlicensed individual operators. Most of them produce shoddy goods, passing off inferior products as superior ones, and falsely labeling their products as those of other factories or imported fertilizers. As a result, the market was flooded with fake and substandard phosphate fertilizers, causing farmers to suffer.

The county's industrial and commercial administrative department, based on public reports, conducted a thorough investigation of all 27 small phosphate fertilizer plants in the county and found that 11 of them were involved in counterfeiting. They also sampled and tested the products of 19 small phosphate fertilizer plants and found that all the products were substandard. One individual-operated small phosphate fertilizer plant produced a type of phosphate fertilizer with a water content as high as 16% and a phosphorus content of only 2.5%, which is only about 1/5 of the phosphorus content of the county's phosphate fertilizer plant's international grade 4 product. However, the selling price of each ton of this product was as high as 170 yuan, which is 9 yuan more than the retail price of 161 yuan for the county's phosphate fertilizer plant.

Shanyang County People's Government has also assigned dedicated personnel to various production material markets and production material retail stores across the county to strictly control the entry of fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural production materials. They have also established a reporting system in rural areas to prevent the resurgence of fake and substandard agricultural production materials.

　　靠坑农发财法纪不容    
    襄阳关闭廿三家磷肥厂    
    千余吨伪劣磷肥被封存或销毁
    新华社武汉５月２日电  （记者熊金超）为保护农民的经济利益，湖北襄阳县人民政府根据群众举报，经查实先后查处了经营假化肥、假农药等坑害农民的案件１２０余起，并勒令关闭了２３家不合格磷肥生产厂家，封存劣质磷肥２２０吨，销毁假磷肥８００余吨。
    去年以来，随着生产资料市场缺口的加大，一些不法分子乘机而入，大肆非法生产和经营伪劣化肥。仅去年５月至７月短短３个月，襄阳县小磷肥生产厂家就猛增了２０多家。这些乘机暴发起来的厂家有的是乡镇企业，有的是村办企业，还有的是些无照经营的个体户。他们多数粗制滥造，以次充好，并假冒其他厂家的产品及进口磷肥，一时间伪劣磷肥充斥市场，农民叫苦不迭。
    这个县工商行政管理部门根据群众的举报，对全县２７家小磷肥厂进行了重点清查，发现有１１家有假冒行为。他们还对其中１９家小磷肥厂的产品进行抽样化验，发现全部产品均不合格。一家个体小磷肥厂生产的普钙磷肥水分含量高达１６％，含磷量却仅有２．５％，只相当于县磷肥厂生产的国际４级品产品含磷量的１／５左右，而其产品的每吨售价却高达１７０元，比县磷厂的１６１元零售价还高出９元。
    襄阳县人民政府还在全县各生产资料市场及生产资料门市部配备了专管员，严格把住化肥、农药等农用生产资料的入库关，并在农村普遍建立了举报制度，以防止伪劣农用生产资料卷土重来。
