The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Executive Committee issued a statement on May 12, saying it would make every effort to persuade the U.S. government to agree to the State of Palestine joining the World Health Organization and other United Nations agencies.

The statement said that the State of Palestine's membership in these organizations would promote support for the Palestinian cause among people worldwide in various fields and foster peace sentiments among the Palestinian people.

The statement said that the U.S. action of refusing to allow the State of Palestine to join these organizations is harmful to dialogue between the U.S. and Palestine.

The State of Palestine has recently applied to join the United Nations agencies, including the World Health Organization, UNESCO, and the Food and Agriculture Organization. So far, it has observer status in these organizations.

The United States has threatened to withdraw its funding from the World Health Organization if it formally admits the State of Palestine as a member.

The World Health Organization has decided to postpone for one year the discussion on the State of Palestine's application to join the organization.

　　巴全委会就加入世界卫生组织发表声明
  　指责美立场对美巴对话有害
    新华社开罗５月１２日电  据埃及中东通讯社报道，巴勒斯坦全国委员会１２日发表声明说，它将尽最大努力劝说美国政府同意巴勒斯坦国加入世界卫生组织和联合国其他机构。
    声明说，巴勒斯坦国加入这些组织将促进世界人民在各个领域对巴勒斯坦事业的支持，促进巴勒斯坦人民中间的和平倾向。
    声明说，美国拒绝巴勒斯坦国加入这些组织的行动，对美、巴两国之间的对话是有害的。
    巴勒斯坦国最近申请加入的联合国机构有世界卫生组织、联合国教科文组织和联合国粮农组织。迄今为止，它在这些组织中享有观察员的资格。
    美国威胁说，如果世界卫生组织正式接纳巴勒斯坦国为其成员国，美国就将撤回对该组织的资助。
    世界卫生组织已作出决定，推迟一年讨论巴勒斯坦国要求加入该组织的申请。
