Under the jurisdiction of Pingzheng Township in Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, there are six administrative villages, five of which have names containing the character "heart." They are: Zhongxin Village, Gongxin Village, Hexin Village, Hongxin Village, and Pingxin Village. Therefore, the local people of various ethnic groups affectionately refer to Pingzheng Township as "Connected Hearts Village." When I asked about the origin and meaning of the character "heart," the township Party Committee Secretary, Wang Yongzhong, smiled and said, "Pingzheng Township is composed of multiple ethnic groups, including Han, Gelao, Miao, and Yi. The character 'heart' symbolizes purity, embodies cohesion, expresses intimacy, and is filled with emotion, signifying the unity of all ethnic groups."

After hearing this, I set out to visit this warm and bright "heart" room...

This is an old story, but it is still talked about as if it were new.

In the spring of 1962, Li Tingchu, a Gelao ethnic community member from Hongxin Village in the township, was about to formally marry Mou Guangshu, a Han ethnic girl from Huanmeng Township's Shen Village. To make the incoming bride satisfied and comfortable, the Li family had decorated their residence grandly a few days earlier. The groom, Li Tingchu, was overjoyed.

They met at a market fair. In that era, when inter-ethnic love was taboo, it was even more unacceptable for different ethnic groups to have mutual affection. Therefore, they hid the fact of their different ethnic backgrounds from their parents.

As dusk approached, the bride's procession appeared on the back mountain. The bride was adorned with a headscarf and colorful ribbons, and firecrackers were set off along the way, creating a lively atmosphere. There were many people to see the bride, snatch candy, and cause mischief in the bridal chamber. At the banquet, naturally, someone added to the festivity with a toast: "To the union of our Han and Gelao families, let's drink to that!" No one could have foreseen that this auspicious toast would lead to an inauspicious incident. The next day, the bride's family found out that the groom was a Gelao, and like committing some grave sin, they shouted to have their daughter forcibly taken back home, and sued Li Tingchu to the Fengxiang District Court for "kidnapping a woman." The court quickly accepted the case. Li Tingchu, after failing to reach a settlement in court, reluctantly divorced...

When I found the person who had handled the case at that time, Tian Jinhai, and asked him about the subsequent developments, he joyfully told me, "Rest assured, the couple is living quite comfortably now. Although they are both over fifty, they are still as harmonious as ever. Their eldest son, Li Yuan, works at the Zunyi Aluminum Plant. Not long ago, they met me and kept saying, 'Commissioner Tian, thank you. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't have been able to form a family, and our child wouldn't have a job.'"

"How did they reconcile?" I asked.

"After the divorce, the woman never remarried, and the man never took another wife, as if they had agreed beforehand. Two years later, the woman pretended to be ill at home, refusing to eat or drink. Her mother panicked. I quickly found the village head, Cai Fengpei, and invited the man to the woman's home. To everyone's surprise, the woman's illness suddenly disappeared. Later, with our repeated guidance, the woman's parents also came around, and the reconciliation became natural!" Old Tian said, seeming quite pleased.

According to preliminary statistics, in 1988, Pingzheng Township had over 30 inter-ethnic marriages between Han and Gelao.

In the summer of 1986, during the rice transplanting season, a drought struck, and the ground cracked.

On this day, Tian Jian (Gelao ethnic) and Fu Yinghua (Han ethnic) from the Dafen Village Group in Gongxin Village were both trying to irrigate their rice fields. Water was precious during a drought, and the water Tian Jian had worked hard to obtain was filtered out after passing through Fu Yinghua's field. In desperation, they exchanged heated words, and soon fists were flying, pushing and shoving each other into the mud, fighting in a heap. Fu Yinghua was injured and hospitalized. Afterward, Tian Jian regretted his actions and, without waiting for the district and township work teams to come down, went to the hospital to take care of Fu Yinghua, taking on all the hospital and medical expenses, totaling over a thousand yuan.

As the saying goes, "No fight, no friendship." Now they are the best partners in the village: sharing the feeding of oxen and helping each other out without asking for payment.

When I visited Tian Jian in Gongxin Village, he spoke with a guilty expression, "It was all my fault. I have a quick temper and hit Fu Yinghua so badly. I've felt bad about it ever since. I said that if I ever do something wrong again, I'll be heartless and rotten."

The people of Gongxin Village are all so straightforward.

If the people of "Connected Hearts Village" generally get along well, it is inseparable from the unity of the township and village cadres. Take the township for example; there are 19 township cadres, 9 of whom are Gelao, 8 are Han, and 2 are Miao. In 1988, during the county's performance evaluation, Pingzheng Township was awarded the "Civilized Unit" banner. Even more commendable is that the township cadres maintain close ties with the masses, caring for their cold and heat. When an elderly man surnamed Shan from Hexin Village passed away, due to a lack of a coffin and funeral clothes, he could not be buried. Township head Quan Xingming (Han ethnic) learned of this and promptly sent several hundred yuan and 16 meters of cloth, solving the Shan family's funeral needs. The Gelao ethnic people in Hexin Village would tell anyone, "The Han cadres here are the best. They think of things we haven't even thought of."

Of course, the people of "Connected Hearts Village" are not always so harmonious. They have worries about life (40% of the township are impoverished households), fears of interfering with inter-ethnic marriages (inter-ethnic marriages face illegal interference), and disappointments with the "Autonomy Law" (financial burdens are too heavy). As we were about to leave, they hoped we could take their wishes with us.

### “连心村”话情

　　“连心村”话情
    本报记者  郭嘉
    贵州省遵义县的平正仡佬族乡下属６个行政村，其中５个村名带有“心”字。它们是：中心村、共心村、合心村、红心村和平心村。所以当地各族群众亲昵地称平正乡为“连心村”。当我问起“心”的来由和含义时，乡党委书记王永中笑盈盈地说：“平正乡是由汉、仡佬、苗、彝等多民族组成的乡，‘心’象征纯洁、体现凝聚、表达亲密、饱含情感，寓意各民族团结一心。”
    听了一席话，我慕名向这片温馨而透亮的“心”房深处走去……
    　　　　（一）
    这是一桩往事，但仍被传为新事。
    １９６２年春季的一天，该乡红心村的仡佬族社员李庭初就要正式和花梦乡沈村的汉族姑娘牟光淑结婚了。为了让即将过门的新媳妇满意、舒适，李家几天前就把居室布置得堂堂皇皇。新郎李庭初更是喜不自胜。
    他俩是在一次赶集场上相识的。自由恋爱在那个犯“忌”的年代里，最容不得“异族”间的两厢情愿了。所以，他俩把不同民族的情况都瞒过各自的父母。
    黄昏临近，新娘家的队伍在后山出现了，新娘包头扎彩，鞭炮一路燃放，煞是热闹。瞧新娘的、抢喜糖的、闹洞房的人着实不少。喜宴上，自然有人祝词添兴：“为我们汉仡两家亲上加亲干杯！”谁也不会料到，这句吉利的祝词竟然引发出不吉利的事端来。第二天，女方家得知女婿原是仡佬族，像犯了什么大忌似的嚷着把女儿强行绑到家里，并上诉枫香区法庭控告李庭初“拐骗妇女”。法庭很快受理此案。李庭初在法庭调解无效的情况下，违心地离了婚……
    当我找到当年负责审理此案的田金海，请他谈谈此案下文的时候，他满心喜悦地告诉我：“放心好了，两口子现在生活得挺自在，虽都已年过半百，但仍和睦如初。大儿子李元在遵义铝厂工作。前不久，两口子遇见我，一个劲地说：‘田科长，感谢你呀，不是你，我们既成不了家，孩子也不会工作’。”“他们后来是如何复婚的呢？”我问。“离婚之后，女的一直不外嫁，男的也一直不外讨，似乎事先商定好了的。两年后，女的在家装病，米不进，水不沾，他母亲慌了。我赶紧找到村长蔡丰培，把男的邀到女方家中，谁知女的病顿时好了。后来在我们多次开导下，女方父母也想通了，复婚也就很自然的罗！”老田说着，似乎很得意。
    据初步统计，１９８８年平正乡汉仡通婚的有３０多对。
    　　　　（二）
    １９８６年夏日，正当水稻返青季节，天旱一场，地皮龟裂。
    这天，共心村大房村民组的田健（仡佬族）与傅应华（汉族）正设法给各自稻田车水灌苗，旱天水是最宝贵的，田健费力弄来的水经过傅应华的过水田一筛滤，就耗没了。人急了免不了骂娘，当即两人动起了肝火，拳脚相加，推搡到泥里厮打成一团。傅应华被打伤住院。事后，田健后悔不迭，不等区、乡工作组下来，就主动去医院照料傅应华，将上千元的住院费、医药费全揽过来。
    俗话说：“不打不成交”，如今他们是村里最好的一对搭档：耕牛伙喂、相互帮工不计酬。
    在共心村，我走访田健的时候，他面带愧色地说：“都怪我不好，我这人火气旺，把傅应华打成那样，我心里一直很难受。我说过了，从此以后，若再做对不起人的事，就黑心烂肺。”
    共心村里的人都是这样的质朴。
    　　　　（三）
    如果说连“心”村里的人，共事一向比较齐心和顺心的话，那么这都与乡、村干部的团结分不开。就拿乡里来说，１９名乡干部，仡佬族占９人，汉族有８人，苗族２人。１９８８年全县开展政绩评比，平正乡拿了个“文明班子”锦旗。更值得称赞的是，乡干部密切联系群众，对群众嘘寒问暖。合心村过世了一位姓山的仡佬族老人，因缺棺木和寿衣，无法入殓下葬，乡长况兴明（汉族）得知此事，主动送去几百元钱和１６尺布，及时解决了山家丧事之需。合心村里的仡佬族群众逢人便说：“这里的汉族干部最好，我们未想到的事，他们早替我们想到了。”
    当然，连“心”村里的人并非事事处处都那样顺心。他们当中还有为生活无着而心虑的（全乡贫困户达４０％），也有为棒打鸳鸯而心悸的（异族通婚遭到非法干涉），更有为“自治法”难以见效而心寒的（财政上负担过重）。在我们就要离开此地的时候，他们希望我们能够带上他们的心愿。
