In the midst of rectification and deepening reforms, the people of China welcome the International Labour Day. Looking at the overall trends in the economic, political, and cultural domains, reform remains the main theme of China. The working class and the labouring people must understand the situation, boost their confidence, and contribute their strength to the reforms.

Reform is a profound and extensive revolution taking place in this ancient country of China, with great significance and arduous tasks. There is no ready-made path to follow; we must advance by summarizing experiences. We need both the courage to forge ahead and the caution to tread carefully, as well as the tenacity to navigate around obstacles. The difficulties we currently face in the reforms are severe. Although we need two to three years to rectify the economic environment and order, this does not mean a halt to the reforms but will instead promote their deepening. We must take the difficulties in the reforms seriously, but there is no reason for pessimism. The reformer Wang Anshi of the Song Dynasty had a poem: "Fear not the floating clouds that obscure the view, for you stand at the highest point." We, the working class, must ascend to the "highest point" and see through the "floating clouds" to discern the direction of the reforms.

The working class is the leading class in our country. Through long-term revolution and construction, it has formed excellent traditions, notably a strong sense of responsibility as masters of the state and the nation. This spirit of mastery is particularly needed in the reforms.

In the past decade, the Chinese working class has demonstrated the spirit of mastery, making tremendous contributions to the reforms, opening up, developing the economy, and building a socialist modernized country. With the development of production, the living standards of the working class have improved to a certain extent. However, due to our country's weak foundation, it is currently not possible to use greater efforts to improve the people's living standards. Additionally, some measures in the reform of the distribution system have not been timely, causing the living standards of the working class to lag behind those who have become wealthy first in the circulation sector. It can be said that the working class has made great contributions to society but has not demanded much in return. This high level of consciousness is admirable. During the rectification, the state will gradually improve the distribution system, implement and perfect the system of linking wage totals with economic benefits in enterprises, so that workers' wages can increase on the basis of improving labour productivity and economic benefits. At the same time, it will strengthen the collection of personal income adjustment taxes to regulate excessive income disparities and alleviate the contradictions of unfair social distribution. For this, the working class also needs to further demonstrate the spirit of mastery, providing more effective supplies to society through practical actions to complete the arduous tasks of rectification and deepening reforms.

In the new situation and tasks, the working class must maintain the tradition of unity and hard work. The working class must closely unite with the peasants and all labourers, providing more and better agricultural products for the peasant brothers. Within the working class, intellectual workers and manual workers must strengthen mutual understanding and communication, emphasizing unity. They must also emphasize the unity of factory directors, enterprise managers, technicians, and workers. After implementing the factory director responsibility system, the construction of material civilization and spiritual civilization is fully the responsibility of the factory director, which is necessary for the interests of the enterprise and represents the interests of the workers. However, politically, the factory director and the workers are completely equal, with only differences in positions, not in status. The factory director must respect and trust the workers; the workers must understand and obey the factory director. Unity is strength, and reform requires unity.

Reform, opening up, and construction all require a stable political and social environment. All the people of the nation should jointly maintain the overall situation of stability and unity. The working class and the broad masses of labourers have played a very important role in maintaining social stability and promoting the cause of reform and construction. We believe that they will, together with all the people of the nation, adhere to the four cardinal principles and the general policy of reform and opening up, to consolidate and develop the situation of stability and unity, and make greater contributions to the modernization of Chinese socialism.

This year is the first year of implementing the policy of rectification and deepening reforms. This year also marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Let us, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, unite more closely, better demonstrate the spirit of mastery in rectification and deepening reforms, work hard, and welcome the glorious anniversary of the 40th founding of the nation with practical actions to advance reform and construction.

### 在改革中进一步发扬主人翁精神——庆祝五一国际劳动节

　　在改革中进一步发扬主人翁精神   
    ——庆祝五一国际劳动节
    在治理整顿、深化改革中，我国人民迎来了五一国际劳动节。综观经济、政治、文化等各个领域的大趋势，改革仍然是中国的主旋律。工人阶级和劳动人民要认清形势，增强信心，在改革中贡献自己的力量。
    改革是在中国这个古老的国度发生的一场极其广泛、深刻的革命，意义伟大，任务艰巨。改革没有现成的道路可走，要在不断总结经验中前进，既要有高歌猛进的气魄，也要有如履薄冰的谨慎，还要有善于绕过险滩迂回前进的韧劲。当前我们在改革中遇到的困难，是严峻的。尽管我们需要用两三年的时间去治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序，但是，这并不意味着改革的停顿，而是将促进改革的深化。对改革中的困难要重视，悲观没有理由。宋代的改革家王安石有一句诗：“不畏浮云遮望眼，只缘身在最高层。”我们工人阶级要登上“最高层”，透过“浮云”，认清改革的方向。
    工人阶级是我国的领导阶级，在长期的革命和建设中形成了优良的传统，其中突出的一点就是对国家对民族有强烈的主人翁责任感。在改革中，特别需要发扬这种主人翁精神。
    过去１０年，我国工人阶级发扬主人翁的精神，为改革、开放，发展经济，建设社会主义现代化国家，做出了巨大的贡献。随着生产的发展，工人阶级的生活水平有了一定程度的改善。但是，由于我们国家底子薄，现在还不可能用更大力量来改善群众的生活，也由于分配制度改进中的一些措施没有及时跟上，工人阶级的生活水平比之有些在流通领域里先富起来的人，相对说来差距拉大了。可以说，工人阶级对社会的贡献极大，而从社会索取的不多。这种很高的觉悟，是令人钦佩的。在治理整顿中，国家将逐步改进分配制度，在企业中推行和完善工资总额同经济效益挂钩的制度，使职工工资在提高劳动生产率和经济效益的基础上得到增长，同时将进一步加强个人收入调节税的征收工作，以调节收入差距的过分悬殊，缓解社会分配不公的矛盾。为此，也需要工人阶级进一步发扬主人翁的精神，用为社会提供更多有效供给的实际行动，来完成治理整顿，深化改革的艰巨任务。
    在新的形势和任务面前，工人阶级还要保持团结一致艰苦奋斗的传统。工人阶级要同农民及一切劳动者紧密团结，要为农民兄弟提供更多更好的农用产品。在工人阶级内部，脑力劳动者和体力劳动者之间要加强互相间的理解和沟通，强调团结，还要强调厂长、企业管理人员、技术人员和工人的团结。在实行厂长负责制以后，物质文明建设和精神文明建设由厂长负全责，这是必要的，既是为了企业的利益，也代表了工人的利益。但是，在政治上，厂长和工人完全平等，只有岗位的不同，没有贵贱的区别。厂长要尊重工人，信任工人；工人要理解厂长，服从厂长。团结就是力量，改革必须团结。
    改革、开放和建设都需要有一个稳定的政治和社会环境，全国人民都应当共同维护安定团结的大局。工人阶级和广大劳动者在维护社会稳定，推进改革和建设事业中起了十分重要的作用。我们相信，他们一定能够同全国人民一起，坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的总方针，为巩固和发展安定团结的局面，为我国社会主义现代化建设作出更大的贡献。
    今年是贯彻治理整顿、深化改革方针的第一年。今年又是建国四十周年。让我们在党中央的领导下，更加紧密地团结起来，在治理整顿、深化改革中更好地发扬主人翁的精神，艰苦奋斗，以推进改革和建设的实际行动迎接建国四十周年的光辉节日。
