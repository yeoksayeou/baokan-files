	By the shores of Dàmíng Lake, how many lotus pods
	How many willows swaying in the gentle breeze
	By the shores of Dàmíng Lake, how many green peaks
	How many white clouds reflected in the water
	Mountains surround and waters encircle, how many famous sights
	How many sweet springs nourish the soul
	Green mountains and clear waters, how many scholars
	How many poems and essays have been passed down through the ages
	With gentle winds and sunny days, how many elderly couples
	How many lovers stroll along the winding paths
	With clear winds and bright moons, how many couples
	How many children play and laugh among the flowers
	In Shùn Gēng Farm, how many fine wines
	How many guests are intoxicated with joy
	In the stadium, how many gold medals
	How many spectators are captivated by the songs
	Days are short, emotions are long, how many lingering moments
	How many blessings are bestowed upon the City of Springs

　　泉城行
    彭俐
    大明湖畔多少莲蓬
    多少垂柳摇借微风
    大明湖畔多少青峰
    多少白云倒映水中　
    山环水绕多少名胜
    多少甘泉浸润心灵
    山青水秀多少名士
    多少诗文历代传咏
    风和日丽多少妪翁
    多少情侣徜徉曲径
    风清月白多少伉俪
    多少孩儿嬉语花丛　
    舜耕山庄多少玉酿
    多少来宾醉意朦胧
    体育馆里多少金星
    多少观众沉醉歌声
    日短情长多少流连
    多少祝福献给泉城
