Tax Evasion, Tax Fraud, Tax Underpayment, and Tax Arrears

Q: On March 7, officials from the Ministry of Public Security and the State Taxation Administration issued a statement calling for severe punishment of violent tax evasion. What constitutes tax evasion? How does it differ from tax underpayment, tax arrears, and tax fraud?

A: Tax evasion refers to the behavior of taxpayers who refuse to comply with tax regulations and fulfill their tax obligations. Examples include refusing to pay taxes as stipulated by tax laws; refusing to complete tax declarations and provide tax-related documents according to legal procedures; refusing to accept tax inspections by tax authorities; and inciting riots, threatening tax authorities, and assaulting tax officials. Those who instigate or harbor such illegal activities are also considered tax evaders.

The key differences between tax evasion and tax underpayment, tax arrears, and tax fraud are as follows: Tax underpayment refers to the behavior of taxpayers who unintentionally fail to pay or underpay taxes. This can occur due to a lack of understanding or familiarity with tax laws and financial regulations, or due to carelessness, such as using incorrect tax rates, failing to report taxable items, underreporting taxable quantities, sales amounts, and business profits. Tax arrears refer to the behavior of taxpayers who, due to unforeseen circumstances, fail to pay or underpay taxes by the deadline set by tax authorities. This can occur due to significant operational difficulties or natural disasters that prevent timely tax payments. Tax fraud, on the other hand, refers to the behavior of taxpayers who use deception and concealment to evade taxes. This includes forging, altering, or destroying account books, vouchers, or accounting records; underreporting or concealing taxable items, sales revenue, and business profits; inflating costs, misallocating expenses, and reducing profit amounts; transferring assets, income, and profits to avoid paying taxes; and instructing, encouraging, or urging others to engage in such illegal activities.

Q: What penalties do those who commit tax underpayment, tax arrears, tax fraud, and tax evasion face?

A: According to Chinese law, for tax underpayment, tax authorities will order the taxpayer to pay the unpaid taxes within a specified period. If the taxes are not paid by the deadline, a late fee of 0.5% per day will be charged on the unpaid taxes from the date of underpayment. For tax arrears, tax authorities will order the taxpayer to pay the overdue taxes within a specified period, and a late fee of 0.5% per day will be charged on the overdue taxes from the date of arrears. For tax fraud, tax authorities will order the taxpayer to pay the evaded taxes within a specified period and impose a fine of up to five times the evaded taxes. Directly responsible individuals and those who instruct, encourage, or urge tax fraud will face a fine of up to 1,000 yuan. For tax evasion, tax authorities will order the taxpayer to pay the evaded taxes and impose a fine of up to five times the evaded taxes. Depending on the taxpayer's specific situation, an additional fine of up to 50,000 yuan may be imposed. Directly responsible individuals and those who instigate, harbor, or support tax evasion will face a fine of up to 1,000 yuan. According to the Chinese Criminal Law, those who violate tax regulations and commit serious tax fraud or tax evasion will, in addition to paying the taxes and potential fines, face imprisonment of up to three years or criminal detention for directly responsible individuals.

　　抗税、偷税与漏税、欠税
    问：三月七日，公安部、国家税务局负责人发表谈话，要求对暴力抗税行为严加惩处。请问：何为抗税？它与漏税、欠税、偷税有何不同？
    答：抗税，是指纳税人拒绝遵照税收法规履行纳税义务的行为。如，拒不执行税法规定缴纳税款；拒不按照法定手续办理纳税申报和提供纳税资料；拒绝接受税务机关依法进行纳税检查；聚众闹事、威胁税务机关和殴打税务人员等。唆使、包庇上述违法行为的也属抗税行为。
    抗税与漏税、欠税、偷税的不同之处在于：漏税，是指纳税人并非故意未缴或者少缴税款的行为。如由于不了解、不熟悉税法规定和财务制度，或因工作粗心大意，错用税率，漏报应税项目，少计应税数量、销售金额和经营利润等。欠税，是指纳税人因故超过税务机关核定的纳税期限，未缴或少缴税款的行为。如由于生产经营遇到重大困难或遭受自然灾害等客观原因而无法按时纳税。偷税，则是指纳税人使用欺骗、隐瞒等手段逃避纳税的行为。如采取伪造、涂改、销毁帐册、票据或记帐凭证；少报、隐瞒应税项目、销售收入和经营利润；虚增成本、乱摊费用、缩小利润数额；转移资产、收入和利润的帐户，逃避应纳税款等，以及指使、授意和怂恿进行上述违法行为的，都属于偷税行为。
    问：漏税、欠税、偷税、抗税者将受到什么处罚？
    答：根据我国法律，对漏税者，税务机关应当令其限期照章补缴所漏税款；逾期未缴的，从漏税之日起，按日加收所漏税款千分之五的滞纳金。对欠税者，税务机关除令其限期照章补缴所欠税款外，从滞纳之日起，还要按日加收所欠税款千分之五的滞纳金。对偷税者，税务机关除令其限期照章补缴所偷税款外，并处以所偷税款五倍以下的罚款；对直接责任人和指使授意、怂恿偷税行为者，可处以一千元以下罚款。对抗税者，税务机关除令其照章补缴税款和处以所抗税款五倍以下的罚款外，并可以根据纳税人的具体情况，加罚五万元以下的罚款；对直接责任人和唆使、包庇、支持抗税行为者，可处一千元以下的罚款。我国《刑法》规定，对违反税收法规，偷税、抗税情节严重的，除按照税收法规补税并且可以罚款外，对直接责任人员，处以三年以下有期徒刑或拘役。
