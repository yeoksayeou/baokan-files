Some areas in Beijing lack designated sites for toilet construction, and as of now, there are still 213 manually cleaned and dug-out household toilets in the urban area, which are maintained by workers nearing retirement. Due to the difficulty in recruiting toilet cleaners, excrement cannot be promptly cleared, and people's representatives and the public have repeatedly submitted proposals and letters, strongly demanding a change in this situation.

Beijing currently has over 57,000 public toilets. Among these, over 50,000 are within units, over 1,000 are at tourist spots, 18 are designated for foreign guests, and over 6,800 are managed by the sanitation department. Most of these 6,800 toilets were hastily built in the 1950s and 1960s with low construction standards and poor sanitary conditions, lacking partitions and washbasins. To improve this situation, Beijing Municipality began implementing the "three-point" measures (where the government contributes a portion, the district contributes a portion, and the beneficiary unit contributes a portion) in 1984, investing 17 million yuan to build and renovate toilets. However, with this renovation capacity, it would take 40 to 50 years to renovate all the old toilets in the city.

Building new public toilets faces challenges in site selection, fundraising, and working with nearby residents. Some projects do not consider the public's interests and often change public toilets into other uses based on a leader's decision. Statistics show that currently, nearly 20 toilets have been demolished due to road widening, construction of shops, restaurants, and other facilities. Among these, only three have been restored.

Beijing faces difficulties in recruiting public toilet management personnel, and there is a shortage of tools and supplies, making it hard to meet hygiene standards.

In Dongcheng District, there is a group of nannies from Anhui and Sichuan. After buying groceries and completing household chores for their employers in the morning, they secretly come out to clean public toilets. They do not reveal their addresses to the sanitation department, fearing they might be fired if their employers find out. Usually, they cannot be found, but when it's time to collect their wages, these nannies appear at the sanitation bureau.

To address the sanitation department's funding shortage and improve public toilet hygiene standards, Beijing Municipality implemented a fee collection system in 25 toilets across the city in May 1987. According to incomplete statistics, Beijing Railway Station collects an average of 300 to 400 yuan per day. However, some toilets are less busy, collecting only a few yuan per day, not enough to cover the wages of the fee collectors.

Some people believe that implementing fees for some toilets in Beijing has made them cleaner, but there are still issues, such as increased management personnel and costs. Can we start from enhancing citizens' awareness of public hygiene, strengthening the self-improvement of management personnel, and seeking society's understanding and support to fundamentally solve the predicament of public toilets?

### 北京公厕一瞥

　　北京公厕一瞥
    纪民
    北京个别地区无建厕地址，至今城区仍有二百一十三座人工背、掏粪的户厕，仅由一些即将退休的工人担负，由于招收背粪工人非常难，粪便不能及时清理，人大代表和群众多次写提案和来信，强烈要求改变这种现状。
    北京现有公厕五万七千多座，其中单位内部厕所五万多座，旅游点公厕一千多座，供外宾使用的十八座，由环卫部门管理的六千八百多座。这六千八百多座公厕大部分是五六十年代因陋就简修建起来的，建筑标准低，卫生条件差，又没有坑位隔断板和洗手盆等。为改变这种现状，北京市从一九八四年开始采取“三点”措施（即政府补一点、区里拿一点、受益单位凑一点）共投资一千七百万元，用于新建、翻建厕所。然而按照这样的翻建能力，要想翻建全市旧厕所，得花四五十年时间。
    新建公厕选址难、筹集资金难，做公厕附近住户的工作更难。一些工程不考虑群众利益，往往是某些领导人一句话，公厕就被改为它用。据统计，目前仅扩路、修建商店、饭店和其它设施就毁拆公厕近二十座。其中只恢复三座。
    北京招收公厕管理人员难，加之工具、药品等明显不足，卫生标准很难达到。
    东城区有一批来自安徽、四川的保姆，她们早上上街为雇主买完菜和做完一些家务后，便偷偷出来打扫公厕卫生。她们不告诉环卫部门的住址，怕雇主知道后被辞掉。平时无法找到她们，到领工资时，这些保姆便会出现在环卫局。
    为解决环卫部门经费不足问题，提高公厕卫生标准，北京市于一九八七年五月，在全市二十五座厕所中实行收费。据不完全统计，实行收费后，北京站平均每天收三百至四百元。但也有不景气的，有些厕所每天才收几元钱，还不够收费人员的工资。
    有人认为，北京对一些厕所实行收费，使这些厕所确实干净了，但还存在着一些问题，如管理人员增加、管理费用增加等。能否从增强公民遵守公共卫生的自觉性及加强管理人员的自身建设、争取社会的理解和支持上着手，从根本上解决公厕的窘境呢？
