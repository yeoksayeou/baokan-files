	Would Rather Not Be a Minister Than Not Run for Representative
	Yeltsin Resigns

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 23 - The Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet, at Yeltsin's request, dismissed him from his post as First Deputy Chairman of the USSR State Construction Committee on May 23. This is because he was elected as a People's Deputy of the USSR in the March elections this year.

	The election law of the USSR stipulates that ministers of various departments cannot simultaneously be People's Deputies of the USSR. During the election campaign for People's Deputies, Yeltsin had stated that he would rather not be a minister than not run for People's Deputy. Since Yeltsin was a ministerial-level First Deputy Chairman of the State Construction Committee, he submitted the aforementioned request for dismissal to the Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet.

	Yeltsin was appointed as First Deputy Chairman of the State Construction Committee in November 1987, after being removed from his position as First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee.

　　宁愿不当部长　也要竞选代表
    叶利钦辞职
    新华社莫斯科５月２３日电  苏联最高苏维埃主席团应叶利钦本人的请求，２３日解除了他的苏联国家建设委员会第一副主席职务，因为他在今年３月的选举中已当选为苏联人民代表。
    苏联人民代表选举法规定，苏联各部部长不能同时成为苏联人民代表。在竞选人民代表的活动中，叶利钦曾表示，他宁愿不当部长，也要竞选人民代表。由于叶利钦是部长级的国家建委第一副主席，所以他向苏联最高苏维埃主席团提出了上述免职请求。
    叶利钦是１９８７年１１月被解除莫斯科市委第一书记后，就任国家建委第一副主席的。
