The Latin American "Group of Eight" finance ministers' meeting, held here, concluded after three days of internal discussions yesterday. It is reported that the main topic of this meeting was the Latin American debt issue. The finance ministers drafted a document proposing a negotiation plan for reducing external debt and lowering interest rates, to be referenced during new debt negotiations by the member countries. This document will be submitted to the respective governments for review and will be officially released in the near future.

Regarding the "Brady Plan" proposed by the United States to alleviate the burden on debt-ridden countries, some of the finance ministers attending the meeting pointed out that Latin American countries encountered double obstacles when studying and proposing relevant suggestions. One obstacle is the legislative issues in the financial systems of certain industrialized countries. For example, the United States has strict legal restrictions on debtors' ability to transfer loans provided to reduce debt, which will make many banks unwilling to implement the debt relief plan. On the other hand, the International Monetary Fund requires debt-ridden countries to implement continuous economic austerity policies. However, given that the majority of governments in the "Group of Eight" will undergo changes in the coming years, maintaining continuous financial policies will also face difficulties. Some finance ministers attending the meeting expressed that Latin American countries have a "wait and see" attitude towards the "Brady Plan."

　　拉美八国财长会议结束    
    提出减外债降利息方案
    本报巴西利亚４月３０日电  记者兰才基报道：在这里举行的拉美“八国集团”财政部长会议，经过３天内部讨论后已于昨天结束。据透露，这次会议主要是讨论拉美债务问题，财长们拟定了一份文件，提出了关于减轻外债和降低利息的谈判方案，供各集团国家举行新的债务谈判时参考。这项文件将交付各国政府审核后于近期内正式公布。
    对于美国提出的减轻债务国负担的“布雷迪计划”，参加会议的一些财长指出，拉美国家在研讨和提出有关建议时遇到了双重的障碍，一是某些工业国家在财经制度上的立法问题，如美国在法律上严格限制债权者为缩小债务所提供的贷款转账，这将造成许多银行不愿意执行减轻债务的方案；另一方面，国际货币基金组织要求债务国执行连续性的经济紧缩政策，但鉴于“八国集团”中的多数国家政府近年内都将换届，因此要保持连续性的财经政策也会遇到困难。与会的一些财长表示，拉美国家对“布雷迪计划”抱“等着瞧”的态度。
