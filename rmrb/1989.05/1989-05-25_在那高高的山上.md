	On the High Mountains
	Niu Yajie

	Dabie Mountain is beautiful. At the peaks of towering mountains, within the depths of valleys and dense forests, and inside the clear mountain streams, there seems to be a mysterious spiritual essence.

	Not long ago, following the winding, narrow mountain road, I took a car to Luoshan's Zhutang Town. The mountains are high and the sky is low, the forests are green and the clouds are white. The bamboo, the pines, and the tea plantations, high and low, hanging, rolling, and spreading, all in a uniform green, seem to have dyed the air green. A breeze of fresh scent wafts through the nostrils, making the lungs feel cool. Coming from the noisy and polluted city to this place, it feels like entering a fairyland, so wonderful and refreshing.

	The simple tea plantations, plain as the mountains; the simple mountain people, sincere as the mountains. Upon arrival, all worries are dissolved by this green spiritual essence.

	There is no deceit or cunning here. Selling wood, selling firewood, selling tea, everything is settled with one strike, without the habit of haggling. If the deal doesn't go through, friendship remains. Guests are guests when they come, and guests when they leave. Sit down and chat, and you become family. After three sentences, you see each other's hearts. Discussing the past and present without reservations. The elderly talk about the time when Liu and Deng's army marched thousands of miles into Dabie Mountain, speaking with great pride. They witnessed with their own eyes how the weary soldiers, upon entering the lush Dabie Mountain, became like fish in water, like tigers in the mountains, each one spirited and vibrant. They appeared and disappeared like ghosts, and the Nationalist Army's foreign guns, foreign cannons, and foreign uniforms, once they entered the mountains, became panicked and disoriented, fighting only to be defeated. See how divine Dabie Mountain is?

	The land is blessed with talented people. In Xin County and Hong'an, two mountains produce three generals, and one county produces hundreds of generals. The stories make one's mouth water with admiration.

	Now, what about the present? The mountain people rely on their strength, using a pickaxe and a piece of land to cultivate tea, far from being as rich as quickly as those in the cities and plains. But their spirits are rich. There is no complaint, no resentment, only the confidence and hardworking spirit filled with that spiritual essence. An old farmer said well: "In the past, the people of Dabie Mountain used gun barrels; now we need science to become rich. We are a step late in mastering scientific knowledge, so we are a step late in becoming rich! If we can learn to win battles, we can also learn this scientific thing!"

	He is not just talking. The old man pointed to the small school in the town and said: "Go and see, our mountain school's teaching is still among the best in the entire region!"

	I walked into the simple small school. More than 20 teachers all gathered in one large classroom to work, with desks arranged as crowded as students' desks. The enthusiastic and hospitable principal and teachers welcomed us into the office and began to chat warmly. It turns out that 4/5 of the teachers here are privately funded, each earning 18.2 yuan per month. In today's world of rising prices, what can this little money do? The 32-year-old vice-principal Li Wenhai has a family debt of over 2,000 yuan, his wife is chronically ill, and the family is in dire straits, but he buries himself in teaching work every day. The head of the language teaching research group and the class teacher of the graduating class, Zhang Daokuan, is also 32 years old, sharp and capable. His family owes more than 1,000 yuan in debt.

	He said: "To ease the economic tension at home, I took some time to read newspapers and learn some animal husbandry techniques, wanting to buy a small pig to raise. I visited several relatives, but couldn't borrow any money, and in the end, I only bought 3 chickens." These privately funded teachers are all young. The colorful ways of making money in society often attract them, but none of them have changed careers.

	"Why do you love the educational cause so much?" I asked.

	After a long silence, it seemed difficult to answer accurately right away.

	The principal said: "These young people compete with each other every day. Our school's academic performance is among the best in the entire region. Everyone is afraid of falling behind, always focusing on teaching research, who has time to think about other things?"

	The principal's words are indeed reasonable. They are indeed all thinking about teaching, talking about teaching. A special atmosphere makes them conscientiously volunteer for education. This seems to be another spiritual essence, unique to the old revolutionary base area, permeating the depths of people's hearts.

	Look, these young teachers, when talking about the difficulties of life, seem to have a hint of worry; but in an instant, they are replaced by the firm and vigorous spirit of the mountains. The school is full of vitality.

	Dabie Mountain, beautiful mountain! On the high mountains, there is fresh air, lush forests; and more importantly, there are the praiseworthy spiritually rich mountain people, and that mysterious spiritual essence flowing between the mountains and rivers!

### 在那高高的山上

　　在那高高的山上
    牛雅杰
    大别山是美丽的。崇山峻岭之巅，深谷幽林之中，清涓山溪之内，似乎有一种神秘的灵气。
    前不久，顺着飘带一般盘山的窄狭公路，我乘车来到罗山的朱堂小镇。山高天低，林绿云白。那翠竹，那松杉，那高高低低如挂、如卷、如铺的茶园，一律的青绿，简直把空气都染绿了。一阵阵清香扑鼻而来，肺腑都感到清凉凉的。从嘈杂污染的城市来到这里，简直像入了仙境一般美妙舒心。
    一个个简陋的小茶场，朴素如山；一个个纯朴的山民，坦诚如山。一到这里，一切烦恼都被这绿色灵气溶化了。
    这里没有虚伪和狡诈。卖木、卖柴，卖茶，都是一锤定音，没有讨价还价的习惯。买卖不成仁义在。来是客，走还是客。坐下畅叙，就是一家人。话说三句见心肝，谈古论今无顾忌。老年人说起当年刘邓大军，千里挺进大别山，讲得真神气。他们亲眼所见，一队队疲惫不堪的战士，一进入这绿森森的大别山中，便如鱼得水，如虎得山，个个精神振奋。神出鬼没，国民党军队洋枪洋炮洋军装，一进山，就惊慌失措，丧魂落魄地光打败仗，你看这大别山神不神？
    地灵人杰。在新县，在红安，两架山头出三个将军，一个县出上百个将军的故事，听着叫人啧嘴钦羡。
    说到现在呢？山里人凭气力一镢头一块地挖山种茶，远没有城市和平原富裕得快。但他们的精神很富裕。没有牢骚，没有怨气，有的是被那股灵气充溢着的自信与实干劲头。一位老山农说得好：“过去大别山人拿枪杆子，打仗在行；现在要靠科学才能变富。咱科学知识掌握得晚一步，就晚一步富起来呗！能学会打胜仗，还能学不了科学这玩艺儿？”他这不是说空话，老汉指着镇上的小学校说：“去到那里看看，咱这山区小学，教学还在全地区数头码呢！”
    我走进简陋的小学校。２０多位老师，全集中在一个大教室里办公，办公桌摆得像学生的课桌一样拥挤。热情好客的校长和老师们，把我们迎进办公室，亲热家常地交谈起来。原来，这里４／５的教师都属民办，每月工资１８元２角。在物价不断上涨的今天，这一点钱够干什么用呢？３２岁的教导主任李文海，家庭欠下２０００多元外债，妻常年患病，家境窘困异常，他却一天到晚埋头于教学工作。语文教研组长、毕业班班主任张道宽，也是３２岁，精明能干。他家欠外债１０００多元。
    他说：“为了缓和一下家庭的经济紧张状况，我抽出一点时间看报纸，学点饲养技术，想买头小猪养，跑了几家亲戚，没借到钱，最后只买３只鸡。”这些民办教师都很年青，社会上五光十色的赚钱买卖也常常招引他们，但他们一个也没有改行。
    “你们为什么如此热爱教育事业呢？”我问。
    沉默良久，好像很难一下子准确的答出来。
    校长说：“这些年轻人，一天到晚的比着干。我们学校的学习成绩，在全地区居上等。谁都怕落后，整天一个心眼钻研教学，别的事谁还来得及想呢？”
    校长的话确有道理。他们确实都在想着教学，谈着教学。一种特殊的气氛使他们本分地自愿为教育献身。这似乎也是一股灵气，是老革命根据地特有的，浸渍在人们心灵深处的一股灵气。
    你看，这些年青教师，谈起生活的困难来，好像也有一丝忧患；但霎时，就被那大山一样坚毅蓬勃的精神所代替了。学校里充满着生机。
    大别山，美丽的山！在那高高的山上，有清新的空气，有茂盛的林木；更有那值得称颂的精神富有的山里人，和那股浩荡于山水之间的神秘的灵气！
