The Fourth Ice Age Glacier Relic Exhibition Hall, located on the north side of Fahai Temple in Beijing's Western Hills, has recently been completed.

The establishment of the Fourth Ice Age Glacier Relic Exhibition Hall is the first of its kind in the country. It plays a crucial role in the study of the geological, topographical, and ecological environments of North China's region dating back 2.5 million years.

The Fourth Ice Age glacial striations were first discovered by the renowned Chinese geologist Li Siguang in 1957.

The two-story exhibition hall, with a building area of 750 square meters, features seven exhibition rooms. It is constructed next to the site where Li Siguang first discovered the Fourth Ice Age glacial striations. The exterior of the exhibition hall is silver-white, with varying heights and slopes, symbolizing the crystal-clear, flowing, and striated nature of glaciers. It adds a new scenic spot to the picturesque Xishan Forest Park.

Currently, the exhibition hall is being arranged, and it is scheduled to open to the public in October this year.

　　第四纪冰川遗迹陈列馆在京落成
    新华社北京５月２６日电  （通讯员何平、管道亮）坐落在北京西山法海寺北侧的中国第四纪冰川遗迹陈列馆近日落成。
    建立第四纪冰川遗迹陈列馆在国内尚属首家，它对于研究我国华北地区２５０万年以前的地质、地貌、生态环境有着重要的作用。
    第四纪冰川擦痕遗迹，是我国著名地质学家李四光在１９５７年首次发现的。
    这座结构为两层的陈列馆，建筑面积７５０平方米，内设７个展室，建在当年李四光发现的第四纪冰川擦痕遗迹的旁边。陈列馆外观呈银白色，高低、斜坡错落有致，象征着冰川的晶莹、漂漓、擦痕，为风景秀丽的京西森林公园添上了新景。
    目前，这个陈列馆正在布置，它将于今年１０月正式开放。
