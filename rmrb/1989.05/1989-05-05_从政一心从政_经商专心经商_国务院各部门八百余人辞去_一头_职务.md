In the process of cleaning up and rectifying companies, 843 officials from 60 departments under the State Council, who held concurrent positions in companies (enterprises), have voluntarily resigned from their "dual roles" according to the relevant regulations of the Central Committee and the State Council. Those who focus on politics will concentrate on politics, and those who engage in business will focus on business.

It is understood that among the 109 departments under the State Council, 1024 in-service and retired officials hold concurrent positions in companies, including 444 in-service officials and 580 retired officials. In terms of rank, there are 108 officials at the ministerial level, 332 at the bureau level, 375 at the section level, and 209 at the general level.

As of now, there are still 181 officials whose concurrent positions need further study and resolution. Most of them involve issues related to the coordination with other relevant policies. These officials are mainly concentrated in the science and technology, education, cultural arts, and news publishing systems. Due to the reform of the system, the operation of enterprises by institutions, and the self-raised funds for scientific research and institutional operations, these units are mostly "one institution, two signs." For the concurrent positions of officials in the aforementioned science and technology units, relevant departments are studying the issue seriously and will, based on the actual needs of the system reform, clarify and resolve it as soon as possible.

　　从政一心从政　经商专心经商    
    国务院各部门八百余人辞去“一头”职务
    新华社北京５月４日电  （记者曹永安、陈芸）在清理整顿公司中，国务院６０个部门中的８４３名在公司（企业）中兼任职务的干部，现已按中央、国务院有关规定，主动辞去“一头”职务，从政的一心从政，经商的专心经商。
    据了解，在国务院所属的１０９个部门中，有６０个部门的１０２４名在职和离退休干部在公司兼职，其中在职干部４４４名，离退休干部５８０名。从职务上划分，部级干部１０８人，司局级干部３３２人，处级干部３７５人，一般干部２０９人。
    截至目前，还有１８１名干部兼职问题需继续研究解决。他们中绝大多数涉及到同其它已有的有关政策衔接的问题，主要集中在科技、教育、文化艺术和新闻出版等系统的公司中。这些单位由于体制改革，事业单位企业化经营，科研、事业经费自筹等原因，大都是“一套机构，两块牌子”。对上述科技等单位干部的兼职问题，有关部门正在认真研究，将从体制改革的实际需要出发，尽快予以明确解决。
