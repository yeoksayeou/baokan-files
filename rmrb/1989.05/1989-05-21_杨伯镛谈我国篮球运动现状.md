Some of China's strong sports have seen declines, but how is basketball faring? Yang Bozhong, Secretary-General of the Chinese Basketball Association, believes that the description of a crisis in basketball is not overstated. The reasons are threefold:

Firstly, many local sports authorities, under pressure from the "gold medal strategy," have distanced themselves from the three major ball sports. Even in provinces and cities with traditionally high basketball standards, the choice has been made between nurturing a team to win one gold medal or cultivating a single "Otto" to win six gold medals, with the latter being preferred.

Secondly, the training methods and measures of top basketball teams are outdated, lacking innovation.

Thirdly, the cultural and practical training levels of first-line coaches are insufficient, leading to lower standards.

Yang Bozhong used the first National Men's Basketball Club Cup as an example to analyze the situation. He said that teams like Liaoning, which maintain their own style and have stable performance, are in the minority. Most teams are in poor condition, with low training quality. This former star forward from the 1960s Chinese basketball scene particularly feels that there is an urgent need to reassess basketball tactics. After the International Basketball Federation implemented the three-point rule, the Chinese basketball community has made some changes in local issues and forms, with some improvement in outside shooting, but the qualitative changes in the attack-defense structure caused by the three-point shot have not been adequately studied.

Yang Bozhong cited a foreign basketball expert's comment, stating that Chinese basketball teams lack comprehensive offensive capabilities. They often rely on attacking zone defenses and tight press defenses, failing to fully utilize the 30 seconds of attack time with varied tactics. Therefore, when facing Chinese players, as long as they can hold out for 10 seconds, the Chinese team will resort to unstructured "free-style" attacks. Additionally, Chinese basketball players do not emphasize the offensive nature of defense. Centers rarely adjust their defensive positions, standing like posts waiting for the ball, which is too passive. Tall players also do not participate in fast breaks.

When discussing plans to reverse the current situation, Yang Bozhong told the reporter that Chinese basketball has a broad foundation, with public enthusiasm even higher than that of the Sports Commission. There is no shortage of talent; the key issue is training. The Chinese Basketball Association has organized training classes for tall athletes and small players with special skills, and invited experts from the International Basketball Federation to train the main coaches of our national teams. By the end of this year, a national basketball training conference will be held, emphasizing a defensive training philosophy, improving the offensive capabilities of centers, and cultivating more sharpshooters.

In recent years, the Chinese men's basketball team has seen its dominance in Asia waver, while the women's team has not performed well in the World Championships and Olympics. In the Asian Men's Basketball Championship to be held in Beijing in September, teams from South Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Chinese Taipei, Kuwait, and Iraq will not make it easy for the Chinese team to defend its title. Next year, the Chinese women's team will participate in the Asian Championships in Singapore, the Asian Games in Beijing, and the World Championships in Kuala Lumpur. Can the Chinese team maintain its previous rankings in these important events? Yang Bozhong believes that the Chinese women's team can be among the world's best, and the men's team can enter the top eight in the world. The key is to work hard and train rigorously, so the national team can live up to the expectations of the entire basketball community.

### 杨伯镛谈我国篮球运动现状

　　杨伯镛谈我国篮球运动现状
    本报记者  汪大昭
    我国一些优势项目相继出现滑坡，篮球情况如何？中国篮协秘书长杨伯镛认为，篮球运动现状危机的说法并不过分。原因有三：
    其一，不少地方体育主管部门迫于“金牌战略”的压力，对三大球感情疏远。包括一些篮球水平一直比较高的省市，在是培养一支球队去争1块金牌还是培养一名“奥托”独得６块金牌之间，选择了后一条路。
    其二，优秀篮球队的训练手段、方法和措施陈旧，缺少新东西。
    其三，一线队伍的教练受文化素质和训练实践所限，水平不高。
    杨伯镛以第一届全国男篮俱乐部杯赛为例分析说，像辽宁队这样坚持自己的风格、水平稳定的队伍只是少数。多数球队不景气，训练质量不高。这位６０年代中国篮坛的著名前锋特别感到，现在急需重新认识篮球运动攻防战术结构。国际篮联实行远投３分制后，我国篮球界在局部问题和形式上有些变化，外线进攻得分有些提高，但３分球对篮球攻防结构引起的质的变化却缺少研究。
    杨伯镛援引一位外国篮球专家的评论说，中国的篮球队综合进攻能力不行，往往只有攻联防和攻紧逼两招，不会充分利用３０秒的时间连续变化进攻战术，所以，对付中国选手只要能顶住１０秒钟，他们就会变成没有章法的“自由”式进攻了。此外，中国篮球运动员不注重防守的攻击性，中锋的防守位置很少调整，只会立桩一样地等球，太消极，高大队员也不参加快攻。
    谈到扭转上述局面的构想，杨伯镛告诉记者，我国篮球运动有广泛的基础，群众的热情比体委还高，不乏人才，关键问题是训练。中国篮协已组织了高大身材运动员和有特殊技能的小个队员的训练班，并请国际篮联派专家帮助培训我国甲级队的主教练。今年底还将召开全国篮球训练工作会议，强调以防守为主的训练思想，提高中锋的强攻能力，培养更多的神投手。
    近年来，中国男篮在亚洲的优势有所动摇，女篮在世界锦标赛和奥运会上名次不够理想。今年９月在北京举行的亚洲男篮锦标赛上，南朝鲜、日本、菲律宾、中国台北、科威特、伊拉克等队，都不会让中国队轻易卫冕。明年，中国女篮则要在新加坡、北京和吉隆坡连续参加亚洲锦标赛、亚运会和世界锦标赛。中国队在这些重要赛事中能否保住以往的名次？杨伯镛一直认为，中国女篮在世界上名列前茅，男篮打进世界前８名，都是有可能的。唯有苦字当头，从严训练，国家队才能不负全国篮球界希望。
