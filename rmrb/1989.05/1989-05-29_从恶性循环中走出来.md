Title: Breaking the Vicious Cycle

In the midst of political and economic reforms, some cultural industries have fallen into dire straits:

Publishing houses are losing money due to rising printing costs, so they raise book prices to break even. The higher the prices, the fewer people buy, leading to unsold books and further losses for the publishers and bookstores...

Theater troupes lack scripts to attract audiences and have poor economic conditions. Actors and actresses go on tour, the more they leave, the fewer performances they can stage, and the fewer performances, the more they leave...

Film studios lack the funds to ensure high artistic standards, resulting in poorly made films. The worse the films, the fewer people watch them, leading to greater economic losses...

For a period, many cultural industries fell into this vicious cycle, spiraling downward.

The Central Experimental Theater is a case in point. For a considerable time, this theater, filled with top talent, suffered from leadership, economic, and artistic issues. Actors and actresses frequently went on tour, earning more in a single performance than a month's salary. The theater struggled to stage plays, lacking both people and good scripts, leading to worsening economic conditions. The theater was like a scattered pile of gold, lacking both artistic and economic cohesion.

Declining subscriptions and sales, poor economic returns are the state of the entire publishing industry. Academic books saw a particularly sharp decline in sales. The People's Publishing House is a typical example. In 1987, they published 72 academic books, 89% of which were at a loss, totaling 387,000 yuan. In 1988, 100% of their books were at a loss, totaling 400,000 yuan. Zhonghua Book Company, which specializes in classical literature, fell 250,000 yuan short of the state's profit target in 1988.

The economic "straightjacket" is also tightening around film studios. Due to rising costs of raw materials and other expenses, the average cost of a domestic feature film has reached over 800,000 yuan. The China Film Corporation's purchase price per copy this year is 10,500 yuan, yet it is common to see only a few or even just one copy being distributed.

The severe survival situation has pushed some cultural units onto the path of reform.

From the second half of last year to the first few months of this year, many units have achieved varying degrees of success through different methods, gradually struggling out of the vicious cycle. Relevant state departments are attempting to explore reasonable cultural policies to help cultural industries break free from this vicious cycle.

The Central Experimental Theater and the Oriental Song and Dance Troupe publicly recruited directors at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. The directors then arranged new leadership teams and formulated reform plans, beginning to regroup. The Central Experimental Theater premiered its reform-era opening play "Urban Cowboy" in May, which was well-received by audiences and has been running continuously. At the same time, it is also partnering with enterprises to seek economic support for the development of artistic endeavors. The relatively well-off Beijing People's Art Theater is also dissatisfied with the status quo, using economic levers in the arts. Relying on art and economics, it maintains the theater's survival and development. Since the second half of last year, the Beijing People's Art Theater has implemented a structural wage system, with clear rewards and punishments, motivating actors and staff, and promoting artistic improvement.

After the State Press and Publication Administration allowed publishers to produce 1% to 3% of related topics last year, some publishers saw economic improvements. The People's Publishing House published "The Biography of Jiang Qing" in the second half of last year, selling 300,000 to 400,000 copies, making up for some losses. This publishing house established a comprehensive editing department, seeking various topics. The publisher believes that "best-selling does not necessarily mean good books" and will strive for high-quality, best-selling topics in the future.

Some film studios have seen the emergence of independent producers, a higher form of contracting, although there have been many twists and turns, it has indeed injected new life into the film studios. Xie Jin established a film company within the Shanghai Film Studio, managing both economics and large-scale films. In his words, "What's wrong with having high-quality, high-income films, and a dual system?"

To adapt to the needs of cultural system reform, the Ministry of Culture's "three definitions" plan has been issued, and policies are being formulated to bring performers from underground to above ground, organically combining regular performances with touring performances, both to activate the cultural market and to ensure the performance of excellent plays. At the same time, the Ministry of Culture and the State Taxation Administration are working on collecting personal adjustment taxes, economically controlling illegal income, and making actors' income more reasonable.

The State Press and Publication Administration plans to implement differential taxation on publications, classifying publications into different levels, levying less tax on books with academic value and representing national cultural standards, and more tax on books that are not very valuable but very popular.

Shanxi Province has decided to support the Western Film Studio from multiple angles; Jilin Province established the Changbai Mountain Academic Foundation at the end of last year, specifically supporting the publication of academic works; the China Film Corporation decided last year to support artistic exploration films, buying them first and screening them for free...

The healthy development of cultural industries awaits the success of political and economic system reforms. However, the success of reforms is not something that can be achieved overnight or in a single step. Old fortresses need to be dismantled brick by brick, and new buildings need to be constructed brick by brick. Cultural industries need the unremitting efforts of both insiders and outsiders.

　　从恶性循环中走出来
    本报记者  袁晞
    在政治经济变革的大潮中，一些文化事业陷入了窘境：
    出版社因印刷工价上涨而赔本，为保本提高书价，书价越高越没人买，书积压后降价，出版社和书店越赔越多……
    剧团拿不出吸引观众的本子，经济条件又差，演职员走穴，人越跑越演不成戏，越没戏人越跑……
    电影厂没钱保证较高的艺术追求，以致粗制滥造的片子出笼，片子越差越没人看，经济亏损愈严重……
    一段时间里，不少文化事业落入了这种恶性循环中，在漩涡中沉落。
    中央实验话剧院就是一例。相当一段时期以来，这个满是尖子人才的剧院，由于领导、经济、艺术等种种原因，演职员纷纷走穴，在外边跑码头，一场演出的收入超过一月工资。院里要排戏谁也请不回，没人当然没好戏，经济状况每况愈下。剧院似一盘散金，形不成艺术和经济两股凝聚力。
    征订萎缩、发行下降，经济效益差是整个出版业的状况。学术性强的图书发行量下降尤为显著。人民出版社是个典型，这家出版社１９８７年出学术书７２种，８９％赔本，亏损３８．７万元；１９８８年１００％赔本，亏损４０万元。经营“国粹”的中华书局１９８８年离国家要求的利润指标差２５万元。
    经济的“紧箍咒”同样套在电影厂头上，由于原材料和其他费用的上涨，国产故事片平均成本已达８０多万元，中影公司每个拷贝的收购单价今年是１０５００元，而发行几个甚至一个拷贝的情况屡见不鲜。
    能否生存的严峻局面把一些文化单位逼上了改革之途。
    从去年下半年到今年前几个月，许多单位以不同的方式，取得了不同程度的成效，一步一步地从恶性循环中挣扎出来。国家有关部门正在尝试探索合理的文化政策，帮助文化事业冲出恶性循环的怪圈。
    中央实验话剧院、东方歌舞团去年底今年初都公开招聘了团长，团长又安排了各级新班子，制定出改革方案，开始重整旗鼓。中央实验话剧院５月推出了改革后的开门戏《都市牛仔》，受到观众欢迎，连演不衰，同时也在同企业挂钩，谋求发展艺术事业的经济支持。境况较好的北京人艺也不满于现状，把经济杠杆用于艺术事业，靠艺术和经济维持剧团的生存和发展。去年下半年起人艺实行了结构工资制，奖罚分明，调动了演职员的积极性，促进了艺术水平的提高。
    在新闻出版署去年允许出版社出１％—３％相关相近的选题后，一些出版社经济上有了转机。人民出版社去年下半年出了《江青外传》，卖了三四十万册，补了不少亏损。这家出版社建了综合编辑室，寻求多种选题，出版社负责人认为“畅销未必是好书”，今后要谋求质量高又畅销的选题。
    一些电影厂出现了独立制片人，这是较高程度的承包制，虽然其中有不少波折，但毕竟给电影厂注入了生机。谢晋在上影厂内建了影业公司，一手抓经济、一手抓巨片，用他的话说，“能拍高质量高收入的片子，一厂两制有什么不好？”
    为适应文化体制改革的需要，文化部“三定”方案已经出台，正在制定政策，把穴头从地下请到地上，使剧团的正常演出和走穴演出有机地结合起来，既要活跃文化市场，又要保证优秀剧目的上演。同时，文化部和国家税务局正在搞征收个人调节税的工作，从经济卡住非法收入，使演员的收入趋于合理。
    新闻出版署准备搞出版差别税，把出版物分等级，对有学术价值、代表国家文化水平的书少收税，对价值不大但很畅销的书多征税。
    陕西省决定从多方面扶持西影厂；吉林省去年底建立了长白山学术基金会，专项扶持学术著作出版；中影公司去年决定扶持艺术探索片，先出钱买下，免费上映……
    文化事业的健康发展有待于政治和经济体制改革的成功，然而，改革的成功不是朝夕可待，一蹴可就的，旧堡垒要一砖一石地拆，新大厦也需一砖一石地建，文化事业需要圈内圈外的人作出不懈的努力。
