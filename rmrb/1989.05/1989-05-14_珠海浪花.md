The performances by foreign artists participating in the China Shenzhen Zhuhai International Art Festival in Zhuhai have left a deep impression on the local audience. Their love for China and their dedication to the arts are equally moving.

Famous Italian Neapolitan singer Bruno Venturini said upon arriving in Zhuhai, "I feel as if I've returned to my hometown; Zhuhai is as beautiful as I imagined." The opening ceremony had only scheduled him to sing four or five songs, which he found unsatisfactory, saying, "That's like not even starting to sing!" After patient explanations from the staff, he reluctantly complied. On the first day of the Italian art troupe's performance in Zhuhai, he sang more than ten songs, finally fulfilling his wish.

According to the arrangements of the Art Festival Organizing Committee, only a few members of the 30-person American music and dance troupe came to Zhuhai for the opening ceremony performance. Upon setting foot in Zhuhai, they were overjoyed, repeatedly saying, "We will definitely introduce our friends to come to China, to Zhuhai."

The most eye-catching performance in the Zhuhai opening ceremony was the Eastern dance performed by the Turkish folk art troupe Hatice Cibele Can. However, this artist burst into tears because of a 20-second early curtain call due to staff negligence. Despite the audience's thunderous applause, she still felt regretful, believing her performance was unsuccessful. Later, when she took the stage again, she performed even more brilliantly.

French artist Betelran is an Argentine who resides in France. When he returned to his country, he held an Argentine passport without a Hong Kong visa, making it impossible for him to pass through Hong Kong. The Art Festival reception team immediately contacted the border inspection station, customs, and the Hong Kong travel agency. Upon hearing it was an artist for the festival, all parties simplified the procedures, and the problem was resolved smoothly.

　　珠海浪花
    王界敏　雷静波
    在珠海，参加中国深圳珠海国际艺术节的外国艺术家的精湛表演，给珠海观众留下了深刻的印象；他们对中国的热爱和对艺术事业的执著，同样令人动容。
    著名的意大利拿波里歌曲演唱家布鲁诺·文图里尼一到珠海就说，“我仿佛回到了故乡”；“珠海和我想象的一样，非常美”。开幕式上只安排他唱四、五首歌曲，他很不以为然，说：“那等于声音还没有发出来哩！”经工作人员耐心解释，才勉强服从安排。第一天，意大利艺术团在珠海正式演出，他一连唱了１０多首歌，终于如愿以偿。
    根据艺术节总组委会安排，美国音乐舞蹈艺术团中的３０人，仅有少数几个来珠海参加开幕式演出。踏上珠海土地，他们喜出望外，连声说，“回去后一定向朋友介绍，到中国，珠海不可不看。”
    珠海区开幕式演出的节目中，最引人注目的莫过于土耳其民间艺术团哈特杰·茜贝尔·詹演出的东方舞了。然而，这位艺术家因为工作人员的疏忽落幕早了２０秒而失声痛哭。观众掌声雷动，她仍深感遗憾，觉得表演没有成功。尔后再次登台，她发挥得更加淋漓尽致。
    法国艺术团演员贝泰兰先生是阿根廷人，在法国定居；他启程回国时，持的是阿根廷护照，没有香港签证，不能途经香港。艺术节接待组立即与边防检查站、海关、香港中旅社联系，各方面一听是艺术节的演员，一切手续从简，难题迎刃而解。
