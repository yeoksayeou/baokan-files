The biography of Prince Gong Yixin, authored by Dong Shouyi, has been published by Liaoning People's Publishing House. Yixin was the sixth son of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty. He was both a member of the most reactionary and conservative social group of his time—the imperial family—and a pioneer of the new era. He was also someone who strived to prop up and rescue the Qing Dynasty, while simultaneously undermining and destroying its foundations. This book provides a factual and objective evaluation of Yixin's life.
