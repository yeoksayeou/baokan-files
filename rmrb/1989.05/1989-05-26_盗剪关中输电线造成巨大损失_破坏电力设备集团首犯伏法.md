Theft of Power Lines in Guanzhong Causes Massive Losses
The Leader of the Group Destroying Power Facilities is Executed

XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XI'AN, MAY 26 - The Intermediate People's Court of Xianyang City in Shaanxi Province recently held a public trial in Jinyang County, sentencing the ringleaders of the "crime of destroying power facilities," Wang Jiawen and Zhang Jingzhong, to death.

Wang Jiawen and Zhang Jingzhong are both farmers from Anhui Province's Hui County. In March 1987, after drifting from Anhui to the Guanzhong region of Shaanxi, they conspired with farmers from Anhui, including Wang Lihong, Zhu Guoyin, Mu Jinmin, Wang Lijun, and Wang Lifeng, as well as Yang Jincai from Henan Province's Dancheng County and Niu Yunlong from the suburbs of Xi'an City, forming a criminal gang specializing in stealing aluminum power lines. From May 15 to September 11 of that year, they stole a total of 66,285 meters of bare aluminum power lines from 40 villages in five counties and districts in Guanzhong, valued at over 23,000 yuan. They then sold these lines as scrap, earning 5,545.7 yuan in illicit funds.

According to statistics, the destruction of over 66 kilometers of power lines by this criminal gang not only caused widespread power outages in many villages and towns but also resulted in the shutdown of 135 agricultural and industrial water wells. Nearly 10,000 mu of farmland could not be irrigated in time during a drought, causing severe economic losses to the affected regions' agricultural production and township enterprises.

　　盗剪关中输电线造成巨大损失
    破坏电力设备集团首犯伏法
    本报西安５月２６日电  记者景险峰报道：陕西省咸阳市中级人民法院日前在泾阳县召开公判大会，判处“破坏电力设备罪”的集团案首犯王家文、张敬中死刑。
    王家文、张敬中均系安徽省毫县农民。１９８７年３月，两犯从安徽流窜到陕西关中地区后，先后勾结来自安徽的农民王立宏、朱国印、穆金民、王立军、王立功，河南郸城县农民杨进才，以及西安市郊区农民牛云龙等９人，结伙组成专门盗剪输电铝导线的犯罪集团。从当年５月１５日至９月１１日，先后在关中５个县、区的４０个村庄，利用玉米等高秆作物掩护，共盗剪裸铝电线６６２８５米，价值达２．３万余元。将这些铝线作废品变卖，获赃款５５４５．７元。
    据统计，上述６６公里多的输电铝线被这个犯罪集团盗剪破坏后，不仅致使大片村镇断电，而且造成１３５眼农业和工业用水机井停机，近万亩粮田在受旱关头得不到及时灌溉，给受害地区的农业生产和乡镇企业带来严重经济损失。
