China's archaeological work in the past decade has achieved remarkable results. A series of important field excavations and in-depth theoretical studies have opened up new domains for exploring China's ancient civilization.

Archaeologists attending the seventh annual meeting of the Chinese Archaeological Society, which opened on May 15 in Changsha, believe that China's archaeological achievements in the past decade can be compared with the discoveries at the Zhoukoudian site and the excavations at Yinxu in the 1920s and 1930s. The expansion of excavation areas and the deepening of theoretical research have proven that China's archaeological work has made significant progress, and the overall level of the discipline has been greatly improved.

Over the past ten years, archaeological field excavations have gone beyond the traditional Central Plains region. In areas such as the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Northeast China, where knowledge was previously limited, a series of major archaeological discoveries have been made.

Among the important archaeological achievements listed by experts are the discovery in the early 1980s of the Red Mountain Culture altar, temple, and stone pile tombs in western Liaoning; the discovery in recent years of the Liangzhu Culture site in Yuyao, Zhejiang, dating back approximately 4,000 years; and the discovery in Sichuan's Guanghan of the Sanxingdui sacrificial pits of the early Shu people, dating back approximately 3,000 years. Authorities also believe that the dozens of Paleolithic cultural sites recently unearthed in western and northern Hunan, as well as the Pengtoushan site in Lixian, dating back 8,000 to 9,000 years, on the northwestern shore of Dongting Lake, have breakthrough significance for exploring the origins of primitive agriculture in southern China.

　　中国考古工作过去十年成就令人瞩目
    新华社长沙电（实习生王楠）中国考古工作在过去十年间取得的成就令人瞩目，一系列重要的田野发掘和深入的理论研究为探索中国悠久的古代文明开辟了崭新的领域。
    出席５月１５日在这里开幕的中国考古学会第七次年会的考古学家们认为，中国过去十年间的考古成果可与二三十年代周口店遗址的发现和殷墟的发掘相媲美。考古发掘地域的拓宽和理论研究的深入，都证明中国考古工作已经向前迈进了一大步，整个学科的发展水平已有较大提高。
    十年来，考古工作的田野发掘已经超出了传统的中原地区，在以往知之甚少的长江中下游和东北地区已取得了一系列重大考古发现。
    专家们列举的重要考古成就包括８０年代初在辽宁西部发现的红山文化祭坛、神庙、积石塚等遗迹；近两三年出土于长江下游、距今约四千年的浙江余姚反山的良渚文化遗迹；以及长江上游、距今约三千年的四川广汉三星堆的早期蜀人祭祀坑。权威人士还认为，湖南省西部和北部近期出土的几十处旧石器时代的文化遗存，洞庭湖西北岸发掘的距今八九千年的澧县彭头山遗址，对于探索中国南方型原始农业的起源有突破性意义。
