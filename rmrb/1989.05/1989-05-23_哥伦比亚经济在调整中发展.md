Since the 1980s, Latin American countries have generally fallen into the predicament of being unable to repay their massive debts. However, Colombia, which did not over-borrow in the 1970s, is currently the only country in Latin America that can repay its foreign debt principal and interest. Since the 1970s, the Colombian government has implemented stable economic policies, and in the 1980s, it carried out economic adjustments and achieved significant results, thereby preventing a potential international balance of payments crisis. In 1986, the GDP grew by 5.1%, in 1987 by 5.5%, and in 1988 it still reached 4.2%. At the same time, the domestic unemployment rate dropped from the previous 15% to around 10%. Colombia is the country in Latin America with the highest continuous production growth and the most stable situation over three years.

Over the past 20 years, whether in formulating economic development plans or in the process of economic adjustment, Colombia has been cautious and gradual. The government has always adhered to the policy of mobilizing domestic funds and increasing exports to promote sustained economic development, and has combined emergency adjustments with structural adjustments. The main measures are:

1. Adjusting the industrial structure, transforming a single economy into a diversified economy. Colombia was originally a country that produced and exported only coffee. To overcome the vulnerability of a single coffee economy and change the backward appearance of the country, Colombia has promoted diversified operations in agriculture and actively developed the production of export commodities.

In industry, efforts have been made to develop manufacturing, and measures such as restricting imports and tariff protection have been used to promote the development of manufacturing. To promote the export of manufactured goods, the government implements policies to support private capital, and the state provides large amounts of loans to the export industry through financial institutions to promote the development of the export sector. Currently, Colombia's industry has taken shape, and 90% of domestic consumer goods are produced domestically.

2. Actively developing export trade to promote economic development. To promote the export of non-traditional products, the government uses export credit, export subsidies, and implements a slight devaluation of the domestic currency to vigorously develop export trade and promote industrial and economic development.

After several years of adjustment, in 1985, oil production recovered to self-sufficiency and there was some surplus for export. Due to the rapid increase in exports of oil, coal, nickel, and non-traditional products, a trade surplus of $1.79 billion was achieved in 1986, and in 1987, a trade surplus of $1.05 billion was realized.

3. Opening up sources of funds, actively raising funds for economic development. Colombia has consistently implemented a fiscal policy of mainly developing domestic funds and supplementing with foreign investment. To solve the difficulties of investment and reduce dependence on foreign loans, in 1972, a "savings and loan system" was established to calculate at fixed prices, encouraging private savings deposits. In 1974, the government implemented tax reforms, widely adjusted income taxes, appropriately increased sales taxes, and allowed banks and financial companies to offer preferential interest rates to encourage savings and increase loans to the economic sector.

In the early 1980s, due to the large-scale implementation of the "National Unification Development Plan," the average annual growth rate of public expenditure was 10%, and a large amount of investment increased the government's fiscal deficit. In 1982, the deficit accounted for 7.2% of GDP. Faced with this difficult situation, the government took a series of measures, such as strengthening the management of the financial system, reforming taxation, tightening public spending, strengthening budget supervision, adjusting foreign investment policies, and actively introducing foreign investment.

4. Implementing stable policies and strictly controlling inflation. In the late 1970s, Colombia's coffee export income surged, and domestic currency supply increased. To avoid hyperinflation, the government implemented a stabilization plan, decided to strictly control the exchange rate, forced the public sector to tighten currency, and implemented a pre-saving import system. To recover currency and promote industrial development, the late 1970s also implemented a free import policy.

In the early 1980s, the government took controlling inflation as the basis for domestic stability. The main measures included reducing the government's fiscal deficit, implementing price management, implementing strict foreign exchange management, and controlling the money supply. From 1982 to 1986, Colombia's annual inflation rate averaged 20.36%, and in 1987 and 1988, it dropped to 24.07% and 27.7%, respectively.

　　哥伦比亚经济在调整中发展
    徐宝华
    ８０年代以来，拉美国家普遍陷入无力偿还巨额债务的困境。而哥伦比亚由于７０年代没有过度借债，目前是拉美地区唯一能偿还外债本息的国家。７０年代以来，哥伦比亚政府就实行稳定的经济政策，到了８０年代，又进行经济调整并取得显著成效，因而防止了可能发生的国际收支危机。１９８６年国内生产总值增长５．１％，１９８７年为５．５％，１９８８年仍达４．２％。与此同时，国内失业率由前几年的１５％下降到１０％左右。哥伦比亚是拉美地区连续３年生产增长较高、局势相对稳定的国家。
    在过去的２０年，无论在制订经济发展计划方面，还是在经济调整过程中，哥伦比亚都是谨慎从事、循序渐进。政府始终坚持动员国内资金和增加出口来促进经济持续发展的方针，并把应急调整和结构性调整结合起来。主要措施有：
    １、调整产业结构，变单一经济为多种经济。哥伦比亚原是个咖啡单一生产和出口国。为克服咖啡单一经济的脆弱性，改变国家的落后面貌，哥伦比亚在农业方面，提倡多种经营，积极发展出口商品生产。
    工业方面，大力发展制造业，并以限制进口和关税保护等措施，促进制造业的发展。为推动制成品出口，政府实行扶持私人资本的政策，国家通过金融机构向出口工业提供大量贷款，促进出口部门的发展。目前，哥伦比亚工业已初具规模，国内消费品９０％是国内生产的。
    ２、积极发展出口贸易，推动经济发展。为促进非传统产品出口，政府通过出口信贷，出口补贴，实行本国货币微小贬值，大力发展出口贸易，推动工业和经济发展。
    经过几年的调整，１９８５年石油生产恢复自给并有部分可以出口。由于石油、煤炭、镍矿和非传统产品出口迅速增加，１９８６年对外贸易出现１７．９亿美元的顺差，１９８７年外贸结算又实现１０．５亿美元的顺差。
    ３、广开财源，积极为经济发展筹集资金。哥伦比亚坚持实行开拓国内资金为主、吸收外资为辅的财政方针。为解决投资的困难，减少对外国贷款的依赖，１９７２年建立以不变价格计算的“储蓄和贷款制度”，鼓励私人储蓄存款。１９７４年，政府又实行税收改革，广泛调整所得税，适当提高销售税，允许银行和金融公司以优惠利息鼓励储蓄以增加对经济部门的贷款。
    ８０年代初，由于大规模实施“全国一体化发展计划”，公共支出年平均增长率为１０％，大量投资加重了政府财政赤字。１９８２年，赤字占国内生产总值的７．２％。面对这种困难情景，政府采取了一系列措施，如加强对金融系统的管理，改革税收，紧缩公共开支，加强预算的监督，调整外资政策，积极引进外国投资等。
    ４、实行稳定政策，严格控制通货膨胀。７０年代后期，哥伦比亚咖啡出口收入激增，国内货币供应增加。为避免发生恶性通货膨胀，政府实行稳定计划，决定对汇率严加控制，强迫公共部门紧缩通货，并实行进口预先储蓄制。为回收货币和促进工业发展，７０年代末又实行进口自由政策。
    ８０年代初政府把控制通胀作为国内稳定的基础，主要措施有：降低政府的财政赤字，实行价格管理，实行严格的外汇管理，控制货币供应量等。１９８２—１９８６年哥伦比亚的年通货膨胀率平均为２０．３６％，１９８７年和１９８８年分别降至２４．０７％和２７．７％。
