　　五月三十一日为世界无烟日
    新华社联合国５月２３日电  今年５月３１日是全世界第二个无烟日。世界卫生组织总干事中岛宏博士今天呼吁全世界的吸烟者在那一天不要抽烟，以便逐步使全世界真正成为一个无烟社会。
    中岛宏博士说，宣布世界无烟日仅仅是为争取在无烟社会中健康地生活所采取的行动之一。他呼吁世界各国的各级政府一起努力，共同反对吸烟。
    世界卫生组织曾把去年４月７日定为世界第一个无烟日，目的在于唤醒人们，减少因吸烟而引起的疾病。
    据世界卫生组织公布的数字，每年死于因抽烟引起的疾病的人达２５０万，平均每１３秒钟就有一人死亡。
    该组织还指出，自５０年代以来，工业化国家中，因吸烟而导致的肺癌发病率已增长了２００％。
