Recently, I went to the countryside and had conversations with some farmers. I learned that they are very satisfied with the recent emphasis by the Party Central Committee and the National People's Congress on strengthening the foundational role of agriculture in the national economy. How can this be achieved? Based on their personal experiences, they have put forward some hopes. Summarized, these are:

— They hope that the "top" will not change the reform and opening-up policies that enrich the people, stabilize rural policies, and continuously deepen reforms, so that farmers can see increasing benefits year by year.

— They hope that the "bottom" will not change various forms of the household contract responsibility system, respect farmers' autonomy, and ensure that contract agreements are credible, with rewards and punishments implemented. They advocate for a two-way contract system to enrich, perfect, and develop the household contract responsibility system.

— They hope to strengthen socialized services. They want to organize comprehensive production chains and collaborate with farmers through mutual assistance and paid support, changing the deteriorating production conditions that individual households cannot improve.

— They hope that scientific and technological personnel and research achievements will continue to go to the countryside and households, helping farmers to achieve prosperity through science and technology. They also hope for reforms in the education system to cultivate more scientific and technological talents who do not leave their hometowns. They also want to see more dramas and films that reflect farmers' production and life.

— They hope to protect farmers' legal rights. They want to resolutely investigate and punish those who engage in "official profiteering" and those who produce and sell substandard and counterfeit agricultural products. They want to increase the supply of high-quality and affordable fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic films, and other essential production materials. They want to genuinely address the difficulties farmers face in investing in agriculture.

— They hope to further prohibit unreasonable levies, stop the practices of arbitrary fundraising, excessive levies, and price hikes of production materials, and reduce the burden on farmers.

— They hope to severely crack down on criminal elements, maintain social order, and ensure that facilities such as water, electricity, and machinery are not damaged.

— The government should seriously consider the prices of grain, oil, and fertilizers to make farming profitable for farmers.

— In propaganda, it is not appropriate to use the income, living conditions, and consumption of a few individuals to judge the rural situation, especially the agricultural production situation.

　　一些农民想些什么？
    最近，我下乡和一些农民交谈，得知他们对最近党中央和全国人大提出的切实加强农业在国民经济中的基础地位很满意。如何加强呢？他们从切身的体会中提出一些希望。归纳起来有：
    ——希望“上头”改革开放的富民政策不要变，稳定农村政策，不断深化改革，使农民逐年增加实惠。
    ——希望“下头”各种形式的联产承包责任制不要变，尊重农民自主权。承包合同要取信于民，奖惩兑现，推行双向承包，使家庭联产承包责任制得以充实、完善、发展。
    ——希望加强社会化服务。组织一条龙生产，和农民开展协作互助，有偿支援，改变一家一户无力改变而又日趋恶化的生产条件。
    ——希望科技人员、科研成果继续下乡进户，帮助农民科技致富；教育制度上作一些改革，多培养一些离土不离乡的科技人才；增加一些反映农民生产和生活的戏剧、电影。
    ——维护农民的合法权益。坚决查处坑国害民的“官倒”和生产、销售劣质假冒农用商品的奸商，增加质优价廉的化肥、农药、地膜等紧俏生产资料的有效供给。切切实实地解决农民“投入难”。
    ——希望进一步禁止不合理摊派，刹住乱集资、乱提留和生产资料乱涨价的歪风，减轻农民负担。
    ——严厉打击刑事犯罪分子，维护社会秩序，保证农民的水利、电力、机械等设施不被破坏。
    ——政府应认真统筹考虑粮价、油价、化肥价，使农民种粮有利可图。
    ——宣传上不宜用少数人的收入、生活、消费来判断农村形势，特别是农业生产形势。
