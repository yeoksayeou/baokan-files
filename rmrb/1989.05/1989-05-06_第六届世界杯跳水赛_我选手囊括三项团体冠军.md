The Sixth World Cup Diving Championships concluded after three days of intense competition. Tonight, the results for all team events were announced. China's 10-member diving team made history by winning the gold medals in the men's, women's, and mixed team events.

The United States team, with 12 members, secured the silver medals in the team events. The Soviet Union's 8-member team took the bronze in the men's and mixed team events and finished fourth in the women's team event. Canada's 9-member team won the bronze in the women's team event. East Germany, considered one of the world's top four diving powers, did not participate in this competition.

In the fifth World Cup held two years ago, the Chinese team won the women's team gold medal and took silver in the men's and mixed team events, with the latter two gold medals going to the Americans.

Two years have passed, and the U.S. team, weakened by the retirement of diving legend Greg Louganis, has seen a significant decline in strength. The Soviet team's new and old players do not seem to have improved, while China's new and veteran stars are at the peak of their technical prowess. Therefore, China's victory over the U.S. team seems inevitable.

Some American diving coaches noted that China's strength lies in areas where the U.S. team is weak—Chinese athletes generally perform consistently in competitions with few mistakes.

　　第六届世界杯跳水赛    
    我选手囊括三项团体冠军
    据新华社印第安纳波利斯５月５日电  （记者陆文岳）第六届世界杯跳水赛经过３天紧张角逐，今晚决出团体项目的全部名次。中国跳水队的１０名参赛队员第一次包揽了男、女团体和混合团体三项冠军。
    美国队１２名队员则囊括了团体亚军，苏联队８名队员获得了男团和混合团体季军以及女团第４名，加拿大队９名队员取得了女团季军。被认为是世界四强之一的民主德国队这次没有参赛。
    在两年前举行的第五届世界杯赛上，中国队只获女团冠军及男团和混合团体的亚军，后两项冠军均为美国人所得。
    两年过去，美国队由于跳水王子洛加尼斯的退役而显得实力大减，苏联队新老队员的水平似乎未见长进，而中国队新老名将的技术水平则处于高峰阶段。因此，中国队大败美国队，似乎势在必然。
    美国一些跳水教练说，中国队的优点正是美国队的弱点——中国选手在比赛时一般都能发挥正常水平，失误少。
