Nepal, located in the "Roof of the World," has made developing its tourism industry a key strategy for economic growth and eliminating foreign exchange deficits in its seventh five-year plan (1985-1990). This plan is gradually yielding results.

Nepal is a landlocked, closed-off country. For a long time, its small-scale agriculture has severely hindered industrial and agricultural production. Currently, the per capita annual income is around $150, making it one of the poorest countries in the world according to the United Nations. The Nepalese government, in light of its actual situation, has decided to vigorously develop the tourism industry to drive national economic development, aiming to generate $100 million in foreign exchange this year.

Nepal, known as the "Land of Mountains," has ideal conditions for developing tourism. Out of the world's top ten peaks, eight are located within Nepal or on the Nepal-China and Nepal-India borders. Additionally, there are over 50 peaks above 7,600 meters and 240 peaks above 6,100 meters. In the global mountaineering craze, enthusiasts regard Nepal as an excellent place to showcase their skills. The Sherpa people of Nepal are also the world's best mountain guides and assistants, and many climbers of Mount Everest rely on their help.

Nepal is also known as the "Land of Temples." The capital, Kathmandu, is rich in history and is often called an "open-air museum." Over generations, skilled craftsmen have built temples, stupas, shrines, halls, and monasteries with unique characteristics. Kathmandu can be said to be composed of temples, with over 250 temples in a city area of just 7 square kilometers. "A stupa every three steps, a temple every five steps" is not an exaggeration. Among them, many are masterpieces of Buddhist and Hindu architecture. The world's largest semi-circular solid Buddha stupa and the Hindu temple of Pashupatinath are majestic and unique, fully showcasing the superb skills of Nepal's craftsmen.

Nepal is also a true "Land of Festivals," with people saying it has "a festival every three days and a celebration every five days." According to statistics, there are over 100 festivals throughout the year, with more than half being religious festivals. There are also many festivals related to agriculture, birds, animals, people, and landscapes. Whenever a major festival approaches, government offices and schools close, residents dress in colorful ethnic clothing, sing and dance, and celebrate all night. Festival markets are very lively, with many mountain people bringing local specialties to the cities for barter trade.

The towering mountains and magnificent temple architecture, along with the colorful festivals, frequently attract tourists from around the world. In recent years, the royal government has opened six national parks and three wildlife reserves, all with specially trained guides leading visitors to climb mountains, traverse forests, or observe wildlife, ensuring a memorable experience.

The Nepalese government has also focused on developing the aviation industry. Kathmandu Airport has become an international airport, and the Royal Nepal Airlines has built over 50 ordinary airports and helipads in various tourist areas. In particular, the government's "Everest Sky Tour" route, where tourists can pay $70 to board a small aircraft to enjoy the snowscapes of the Himalayas and overlook the "world's highest peak," is very popular. The tourism department has also built many roads, cycling paths, and hiking trails to meet the needs of various travelers. The government also allows foreign tourists to drive their own private planes and cars to visit Nepal.

The Nepalese government has borrowed money from the World Bank to build high-end hotels and encourages private enterprises to build hotels with national characteristics. Currently, Nepal has various types of hotels ranging from $4 to $500 per night. Local people also rent out their wooden and thatched houses to foreign tourists. The government and various levels of the tourism department pay special attention to improving the quality and hygiene standards of traditional ethnic foods. Currently, the number of foreigners bringing their own food to Nepal for tourism is gradually decreasing.

Tourism has become an industry of national importance in Nepal. In the 1960s, there were only about 5,000 tourists visiting Nepal each year, but now the number has reached 250,000. Tourism-generated foreign exchange accounts for half of the country's foreign exchange earnings, and the tourism industry has driven economic development.

　　尼泊尔以旅游促经济发展
    本报记者  任毓骏
    位于“世界屋脊”的尼泊尔王国在其第七个五年计划（１９８５—１９９０）中，把发展旅游业作为促进经济发展、消灭外汇赤字的主要手段，这一计划正在逐步取得成果。
    尼泊尔是个封闭的内陆国家，长期以来，由于小农经济，工农业生产受到严重阻碍。目前人均年收入只有１５０美元左右，被联合国列为世界最贫穷的国家之一。尼泊尔政府针对本国实际情况，决定大力发展旅游业，来带动国民经济发展，今年的指标是创汇１亿美元。
    被誉为“名山之国”的尼泊尔，发展旅游业具有得天独厚的条件。世界十大高峰中，有８座都在尼泊尔境内或中尼、尼锡边界上。此外，还有海拔７６００米以上的雪峰５０多座，６１００米以上的雪峰２４０多座，在世界登山热潮中，登山爱好者都把尼泊尔视为一显身手的好地方。而尼泊尔的舍尔巴人又是世界最佳登山导游和助手，许多攀登珠穆朗玛峰的健儿都少不了他们的协助。
    尼泊尔也称作“庙宇之国”。首都加德满都历史悠久，人称“露天博物馆”。历代能工巧匠在这儿建筑了各具特色的庙宇、佛塔、神龛、殿堂和寺院。加德满都可说是以寺庙组成，市区面积不过７平方公里，竟有庙宇２５０多座。“三步一塔，五步一庙”，一点也不过分。其中，许多是佛教和印度教建筑的精品。那世界最大的半月形实体大佛塔、印度教寺大自在天庙，气势雄伟、造型独特，充分体现了尼泊尔能工巧匠的高超技艺。
    尼泊尔还是名副其实的“节日之国”，人们称它“三日一节，五日一庆”。据统计，全年共有１００多个节日，一半以上属宗教节日，还有许多与农事、鸟兽、人物、山河等有关的节日。每逢重大节日来临，政府机关、学校放假，居民身着色彩艳丽的民族服装，载歌载舞，通宵达旦。节日市场非常热闹，许多山民带上土特产到城镇进行以物易物交易。
    崇山峻岭高入云端，庙宇建筑气魄雄伟。各种节日色彩斑斓，频频吸引着来自世界各地的游客。尤其近年来，王国政府新开辟了６个国家公园，３个野生动物保护区，都有经过专门训练的导游带领的人或爬山，或穿越丛林，或观赏野生动物，让游客尽兴而归。
    尼泊尔政府还集中力量发展航空事业，加德满都机场已成为国际机场，皇家航空公司在各旅游区建设了５０多个普通机场和直升机场。特别是政府开辟的“珠穆朗玛空中旅游路线”，每人交７０美元即可乘坐小型专机欣赏喜马拉雅山雪景，俯瞰“世界第一高峰”雄姿，倍受欢迎。旅游部门还修建了许多汽车、自行车、步行者的旅游线，以满足各类旅行者的要求。政府还特许外国旅游者自己驾驶私人飞机，汽车来尼泊尔游览。
    尼泊尔政府向世界银行贷款修建高级饭店，并鼓励私人企业兴建具有民族风格的各种旅馆，现在，尼泊尔有每天收４美元到５００美元的各种类型旅馆，山民们还出租自己的原木屋和茅草屋供全家的外国游人使用。政府和各级旅游部门特别注意提高传统民族食品的质量和卫生标准。目前，带食品来尼泊尔游览的外国人已逐渐减少。
    旅游业成了尼泊尔举国重视的产业。６０年代，每年到尼泊尔的旅游者只有５０００人左右，如今已达到２５万人。旅游创造的外汇占国家外汇收入的一半，旅游业推动了经济的发展。
