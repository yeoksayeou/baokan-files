Eight heads of state from southern and central African countries held a meeting in Luanda today to discuss achieving peace in Angola. The meeting expressed support for the Angolan government's peace plan and encouraged Angola to strive for reconciliation, creating an atmosphere of peace essential for national development and the happiness of the people.

The presidents of Angola, Dos Santos, Congo, Sassou, Gabon, Bongo, Mozambique, Chissano, Sao Tome and Principe, Da Costa, Zaire, Mobutu, Zambia, Kaunda, and Zimbabwe, Mugabe attended the meeting.

Dos Santos spoke at the meeting, expressing Angola's willingness to seek a path to just, lasting, and comprehensive peace for the country and the region. He hoped that this meeting would achieve results in peace and stability, good-neighborly relations, peaceful coexistence, and cooperation.

The final communiqué issued after the meeting noted that the participating countries had observed Angola's measures to peacefully resolve domestic issues and expressed their willingness to coordinate efforts to end interference in Angola's internal affairs and ensure the security and stability of its borders.

The eight heads of state also expressed serious concern over the situation in northern Namibia in the communiqué and called on the United Nations Secretary-General to take necessary measures to promptly implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 435. The communiqué also demanded that South Africa take concrete steps to end apartheid, stop destabilizing neighboring countries, and fully cooperate in the implementation of Resolution 435.

In March of this year, the Angolan president proposed a peace plan that included South Africa and the United States stopping interference in Angola's internal affairs, maintaining a one-party system, and implementing amnesty. The UNITA, however, has so far rejected this plan and insisted on direct negotiations with the government.

    新华社罗安达５月１６日电（记者赵晓钟）８个南部和中部非洲国家的首脑今天在罗安达举行关于实现安哥拉国内和平的会议。会议表示支持安哥拉政府的和平计划，并鼓励安哥拉努力寻求和解，建立国家发展和人民幸福所必不可少的和平气氛。

    多斯桑托斯在会议上发表讲话，表示安哥拉愿意寻求实现国家和地区公正、持久和彻底和平的途径。他希望这次会议在实现和平稳定、睦邻关系、和平共处与合作方面取得成绩。
    会议结束后发表的最后公报指出，与会各国注意到安哥拉已采取和平解决国内问题的措施，并表示将在结束对安哥拉内部事务的干涉和保障安哥拉边界安全与稳定方面协调各国所作的努力。
    ８国首脑还在公报中对纳米比亚北部局势表示严重关切，并呼吁联合国秘书长采取必要措施，尽快实施联合国安理会４３５号决议。公报还要求南非采取结束种族隔离、停止破坏邻国稳定的具体措施，并在实施４３５号决议方面进行全面合作。
