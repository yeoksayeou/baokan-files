Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, May 28th

Anxiety and doubt shrouded the atmosphere of Western European public opinion on the eve of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit. There are concerns that this meeting might set a precedent for failure.

On May 28, the British Broadcasting Corporation used phrases like "Chaos and division grip NATO on the eve of the summit" to comment on the meeting. Such predictions may be exaggerated, but they do reflect the current situation NATO is facing. On May 29, the heads of state from member countries will gather in Brussels to discuss the future of NATO. After more than a year of intense preparations, the meeting's groundwork is largely in place. The agenda has been basically determined, but there are serious disagreements on some major issues related to Western European security.

This meeting is being held amid a global trend towards détente. U.S.-Soviet relations have improved, East-West relations have eased, and the Soviet Union has made significant adjustments to its domestic and foreign policies, particularly in the area of arms control, where it has frequently launched initiatives and proposed new arms control measures. In response, Western countries, due to their differing geographical and strategic interests, have reacted differently and have yet to come up with new strategies to meet these challenges. Therefore, coordinating policies has become an urgent task for NATO.

According to reports, the meeting aims to coordinate views on East-West relations, determine and reassess NATO's role in the new situation, and respond to Soviet challenges. It is expected that the meeting will issue a political statement outlining NATO's stance and strategy on major global issues. In addition, senior NATO officials, after extensive consultations, have drafted an overall plan on arms control and arms limitation to be discussed and approved by the leaders. This plan is expected to be submitted for discussion and approval by the leaders.

From the discussions before the meeting, it is clear that there are still disagreements among the countries on security issues, particularly on the issue of short-range missiles. First, regarding the negotiation on reducing short-range missiles with the Warsaw Pact, West Germany and some Western European countries believe that this negotiation should be conducted simultaneously with the conventional weapons talks. However, the United States insists that negotiations on short-range missiles should only begin after substantial progress has been made in conventional weapons talks and an agreement has been reached and implemented. Second, the United States demands that NATO countries make a commitment to support the U.S. short-range missile modernization plan, while West Germany believes that the modernization of short-range missiles is purely a U.S. matter and that NATO should not play a role in this regard. Third, the United States insists that NATO should take a clear stance from the outset, namely, that any short-range missile talks should not lead to the complete withdrawal of land-based short-range missiles in Europe. The United States has long been concerned that such talks could lead to the complete elimination of short-range missiles, resulting in a third zero option, which would render NATO's nuclear deterrence strategy ineffective. West Germany, on the other hand, advocates that only "under current circumstances" can the complete withdrawal of short-range missiles be ruled out. The implication is that the future of short-range missiles will depend on the situation.

The disagreements within NATO on the issue of short-range missiles are not only due to differences in internal and external policies but also to geopolitical factors. The fundamental cause of these disagreements is the significant changes in the European and global situation, which have led to changes in the positions of Europe and the United States and the growing divergence of interests between European and American countries.

It is noteworthy that in dealing with the issue of the balance of power between East and West, the United States advocates using short-range missile modernization to eliminate Soviet advantages, while West Germany and some Western European countries advocate adapting to the trend of détente and eliminating advantages on the Warsaw Pact side through negotiations.

From the discussions in Western media, it is clear that some of the disagreements within NATO are difficult to resolve in the short term. This summit is likely to pass some general, principled documents while temporarily setting aside the disagreements to maintain the surface unity of NATO.

### 北约首脑面临艰难抉择

　　北约首脑面临艰难抉择
    新华社记者  杨元华
    北大西洋公约组织首脑会议前夕，西欧舆论笼罩着不安和怀疑的气氛，担心这次会议开创一个失败的先例。
    英国电视台２８日用“首脑会议前夕，北约陷于混乱和分裂”这样的词句来评论这次会议。这样的推断也许言过其实，不过多少反映了北约面临的处境。　　２９日，成员国首脑将聚集布鲁塞尔，商讨北约大计。经过一年多的紧张筹备，会议的准备工作已大体就绪。会议议题已基本确定，但在有关西欧安全的一些重大问题上，出现了严重分歧。
    这次会议是在世界局势趋向缓和的情况下举行的。美苏关系改善，东西方关系缓和，苏联对内外政策作了重大调整，特别是在裁军问题上频频发动攻势，提出裁军新建议。对此，西方各国由于地缘和利益不同而反应不一，一时尚拿不出新招来应付挑战。因此，协调政策就成了北约当务之急。
    据报道，会议的目标是要协调对东西方关系的看法，确定和重新审议北约在新形势下的任务，并对苏联的挑战作出反应。预计，会议将发表一项政治声明，就当前世界重大问题表明北约的立场和战略。此外，北约高级官员经过多方磋商，起草了准备提交首脑们讨论通过的关于裁军和军备控制的总体方案。
    从会前各方讨论的情况来看，在安全问题上，特别是关于短导问题上各国还存在分歧。首先，关于就削减短导同华约举行谈判问题，西德和一些西欧国家认为，这一谈判应与常规武器谈判同时进行，但美国坚持应当在常规武器谈判取得实质进展，并达成协议和开始执行后举行短导谈判。第二，美国要求北约各国在短导问题上作出支持美国执行短导现代化计划的承诺，而西德认为短导现代化完全是美国的事，北约不应当在这方面发挥作用。第三，美国要求北约一开始就要表明立场，即任何短导谈判最后不能导致全部撤除在欧洲的陆基短导。美国一直担心举行这样的谈判会造成彻底销毁短导，出现第三个零点方案，使北约的核威慑战略失效。而西德主张只有“在目前情况下”才可以排除全部撤除短导。言下之意，关于今后的短导前途，将视情况而定。
    北约内部关于短导问题的争论固然有内外政策分歧的原因，也有地缘政治的原因，而欧洲和世界局势发生重大变化所导致的欧美地位的变化及欧美国家切身利益的日渐离异，是争论产生的根本原因。
    人们注意到，在对待东西方力量均衡问题上，美国主张以短导现代化来消除苏联的优势，而西德和一些西欧国家主张顺应缓和潮流，通过谈判来消除华约方面的优势。
    综观西方报刊言论可见，北约内部上述的一些分歧一时难以克服。这次首脑会议很可能通过一些带原则性的笼统文件，而把分歧暂时束之高阁，以维持北约表面上的团结。
