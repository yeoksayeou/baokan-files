Vice Premier Tian Jiyun today delivered a written speech at the National Water Conservancy Conference, emphasizing that during the period of rectification and improvement, we must vigorously strengthen water conservancy construction, deepen water conservancy reforms, and especially do a good job in flood control and drought relief this year to ensure the safety of major rivers during the flood season. This is of great significance for achieving a bumper harvest in agriculture this year, ensuring social stability, and stabilizing the overall situation.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun pointed out that water conservancy is a fundamental industry for social development and the lifeline of agriculture. The State Council has listed the treatment of major rivers, water resource development and conservation, soil and water conservation, and agricultural water conservancy projects as key basic construction industries to be supported. It has adjusted the industrial structure to place water conservancy on an equal footing with agriculture and energy, implementing a policy of preferential investment. While increasing state investment in agriculture, including water conservancy, the state requires local governments at all levels to overcome difficulties and resolutely increase investment in water conservancy. He said that the lessons of recent years' water and drought disasters have been profound enough. We cannot wait for nature to punish us more severely.

Vice Premier Tian stressed that to do a good job in water conservancy construction, we must deepen reforms, focus on improving the water conservancy mechanism, reform the old system and old ideas of "eating from the big pot" and "drinking from the big pot," strengthen management, emphasize economic benefits, and perfect and develop the experiences and achievements of water conservancy reforms in recent years, such as implementing multi-channel and multi-level investment in water conservancy, implementing the labor accumulation system, and rolling use of investment, etc.

Vice Premier Tian specially emphasized that currently, the flood season has arrived. All localities must implement the system of responsibility by the chief, insist on doing both flood control and drought relief, overcome any complacency and false sense of security, and strictly implement the principle of "safety first, prevention first, prevention over rescue," ensuring that everything is done well to guarantee the bumper harvest in agriculture and the safety of people's lives and property. The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters has made arrangements for this, and the water conservancy departments must take the lead in implementing them.

This conference was held in Beijing from May 17 to 21.

　　田纪云在水利工作会议上书面讲话
    加强水利建设防患未然
    确保大江大河安全度汛
    本报北京５月２１日讯  记者肖俊熙报道：田纪云副总理今天在全国水利工作会议上发表书面讲话强调，在治理整顿中，要大力加强水利建设，深化水利改革，特别是搞好今年的防汛抗旱，确保大江大河安全度汛，这对夺取今年农业丰收，保障社会安定，稳定大局，具有十分重大的意义。
    田纪云副总理指出，水利是社会发展安全的基础事业，是农业的命脉，国务院已经把大江大河的治理、水资源开发及节水、水土保持和农田水利工程列入重点支持的基本建设产业，从调整产业结构上，把水利提到同农业、能源同等重要的位置，实行投资倾斜政策。国家在增加包括水利在内的农业投入的同时，要求各级地方政府克服困难，下决心增加水利投入。他说，这几年水旱灾害的教训已经够深刻了，我们不能坐等大自然更严厉的惩罚。
    田副总理强调，搞好水利建设必须深化改革，在完善水利机制上下功夫，改革“吃大锅饭”、“喝大锅水”等旧体制的弊端和旧观念，加强经营管理，讲究经济效益，完善和发展近几年水利改革已经取得的经验和成果，如实行多渠道多层次投资办水利，实行劳动积累工制和投资有偿滚动使用，等等。
    田副总理特别强调，当前，汛期已经来临，各地要实行首长负责制，坚持防汛抗旱两手抓，克服任何侥幸麻痹思想，切实执行“安全第一，预防为主，防重于抢”的方针，只能搞好，以确保农业丰收和国家人民生命财产安全。对此，国家防总已作了部署，水利部门要带头落实。
    这次会议是５月１７日至２１日在北京举行的。
