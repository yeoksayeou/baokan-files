The second World No-Tobacco Day is approaching on May 31, and French public opinion has begun to promote the dangers of smoking, warning smokers, especially young people, that they have "no right to destroy their health." They should also not make the air into a "polluted pit" and cause "substantial harm" to non-smokers with "secondhand smoke." In the trend of advocating a healthy atmosphere and respecting the rights of others, polite smokers who want to smoke also have to consider the faces of those around them and find an appropriate place.

Regarding the harm of smoking, statistical departments and experts have provided some shocking figures: The world's smokers consume 510 billion cigarettes every year. About 250,000 people die annually from smoking-related diseases worldwide, with one death occurring every 13 seconds.

In France, 100 billion cigarettes are consumed annually. Meanwhile, the incidence of lung cancer has increased by 40%, and the state has to spend 10 to 40 billion francs annually to treat diseases caused by smoking. Cigarettes are the "executioners" of 53,000 deaths in France each year. Smoking increases the risk of laryngeal cancer by 10 times and lung cancer by 30 times. 95% of lung cancer patients are caused by cigarettes, which are also the culprits behind oral, laryngeal, and esophageal cancers. Most of the smoke is composed of toxic molecules, some of which inhibit the natural defensive capabilities of the lungs. Pregnant women who smoke increase the risk of respiratory and lung diseases in their fetuses. Birth control pills combined with cigarettes often cause myocardial infarction. At the end of last year's first European anti-smoking policy conference, Dr. Du Liyue, the head of the French Respiratory Disease Prevention Committee, even claimed that the harm of tobacco is greater than that of AIDS. His basis is that France has 50,000 to 70,000 deaths from lung cancer each year, while only 1,000 people die from AIDS. In the next 20 years, the killing power of cigarettes will be even greater than that of AIDS. People pay more attention to AIDS because it has received widespread publicity.

France's anti-smoking campaign has been ongoing for many years, and last year it was designated as "1988: A Year Towards a Smoke-Free World." Extensive publicity in newspapers, television, and advertisements, frequent appeals from health departments, personal testimonies from smokers who have quit, and strong administrative measures have all contributed to the effectiveness of the anti-smoking campaign. People have a certain understanding of the harm of smoking, and the number of smokers, especially young smokers, has decreased. In 1977, this group accounted for 47% of the population, but last year it decreased to 37%. The average number of cigarettes smoked per person decreased from 6.3 last year to 6.2 this year, and the per capita cigarette sales decreased from 2.416 kilograms in 1985 to 2.303 kilograms last year. Many public places have implemented smoking bans, and some restaurants have become smoke-free. The state has raised tobacco prices several times, and each price increase has resulted in a noticeable decrease in the number of smokers. Currently, French public opinion believes that the anti-smoking campaign has been effective, but there are still concerns. The number of old smokers has not decreased, and education for young people needs to be further deepened.

French public opinion believes that nicotine is a major enemy of people, and eliminating the harm of nicotine is a long-term social issue. As long as propaganda is seriously and persistently carried out and various measures are taken, individuals have the willpower to quit smoking, and greater achievements can be completely achieved.

### “我们没有权利自毁健康！”——法国的戒烟宣传

　　“我们没有权利自毁健康！”
    ——法国的戒烟宣传
    魏玉琴
    第二个世界无烟日５月３１日在即，法国舆论已开始宣传吸烟危害，告诫吸烟者特别是青少年“没有权利自毁健康”，也不要因自己使空气变成“大染缸”，用“二手烟”给不吸烟人造成“实质性伤害”。在崇尚健康风气和要求尊重他人权利的趋势下，懂礼貌的瘾君子要想吞烟吐雾也不能不看看周围人的脸色和找个合适的地方。
    关于吸烟的危害，统计部门和专家提供了一些惊人的数字：全世界的吸烟人每年抽掉５１０００亿根烟。世界每年约有２５０万人死于与吸烟有关的疾病，每１３秒钟就有１人死亡。
    在法国每年消耗１千亿支烟，与此同时，肺癌发病率增加了４０％，国家每年不得不以１００亿至４００亿法郎的巨资来治疗吸烟引起的疾病。香烟是法国每年５．３万人死亡的“刽子手”。吸烟使得喉癌机会增加１０倍，使得肺癌机会增加３０倍。９５％的肺癌病患是由香烟引起的，香烟也是造成口腔癌、喉癌、食道癌的祸首。烟雾中绝大部分为有毒分子，某些分子会抑制肺部的天然防卫能力。怀孕妇女吸烟致胎儿易患呼吸道和肺部疾病，避孕药加上香烟常会引起心肌梗塞。在去年底举行的首届欧洲反烟政策会议上，法国防治呼吸器官疾病委员会主任杜利厄医生甚至断言：烟毒的危害更甚于艾滋病。他的根据是，法国每年死于肺癌者有５至７万人，而死于艾滋病者仅１千余人，在未来２０年内，香烟的杀伤力更甚于艾滋病，人们重视艾滋病因它得到了广泛的宣传。
    法国反吸烟宣传已有多年，去年还被确定为“１９８８：朝向无烟世界迈进的一年。”报章、电视、广告的广泛宣传，卫生部门的不时呼吁，瘾君子戒烟后的现身说法，有力的行政措施等使戒烟宣传收到一些效果。人们对烟害有了一定认识，吸烟者特别是“小烟囱”有减少。１９７７年这部分人占人口的４７％，去年减至３７％。人均吸烟量从去年的６．３支减为今年的６．２支，香烟销量１９８５年人均２．４１６克减为去年的２．３０３克。不少公共场所已实行禁烟，有的饭店已成禁烟饭店，国家已几次提高烟草价格，每提一次价，吸烟人都明显减少些。当前，法国舆论认为，戒烟宣传有成效，但也仍有隐忧，老烟枪不见减少，对青少年教育还要更深入进行。
    法国舆论认为尼古丁是人们的大敌，戒除尼古丁的毒害是一个长期的社会问题，只要认真坚持宣传，采取多种措施，个人有恒心戒烟，取得更大的成效是完全可能的。
