In the vast rural areas of the Democratic Republic of Germany, when people talk about "rural nurses," they think of strong, experienced women carrying medical bags, riding bicycles from one village to another. Whether it's sunny or rainy, or windy or snowy, they always appear on time at the farmers' homes, dedicating their efforts to the health of the farmers. These "rural nurses" are deeply respected and loved by the farmers.

Anita Bauritz is 35 years old and is also called a "rural nurse," but she works in the city. Her outstanding work and her attentive care for patients and the elderly have also earned her the respect and love of the people in her district.

Three years ago, Anita accepted an assignment from the hospital to work as a visiting nurse in the hospital's district. She felt very honored by this job, believing it would allow her to fully utilize her medical knowledge and her spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people. She is responsible for four streets, and her service targets are mostly elderly people, with almost all patients being twice her age. From the first day she received her assignment, she rode her bicycle around these four streets to take care of the patients, sometimes even sacrificing her own vacation to serve them.

Her service work actually goes beyond the duties of a nurse. Every time she visits a patient, she follows the routine of checking their blood pressure and asking about their condition. She also cares about whether the elderly people's refrigerators are working properly, if the gas stoves are leaking, and if someone is helping them clean the house, etc. Then, she records all these in her notebook. If she finds any problems, she helps to solve them immediately.

During her rounds, she pays special attention to the elderly's complaints. Sometimes, when the elderly's children and grandchildren haven't visited for a long time, she comforts them with kind words. She also often reads letters sent by their families to the elderly. In her district, there is a 93-year-old couple who have been living together for over 40 years, and their life is quite lonely. A year ago, Anita discovered their living conditions and almost every morning she would come to see them and prepare breakfast. The elderly people, not without exaggeration, said, "Her coffee is even better than that of some high-class cafes." Indeed, her visits bring joy and hope to the lives of these two elderly people.

Anita's three years of hard work have earned her the praise of the patients, especially the elderly, in her district. One day, 84-year-old Mrs. Kremelitz personally picked a bouquet of fresh flowers and stood at the door waiting for her arrival to express her gratitude to this white-clad warrior. Such actions by Mrs. Kremelitz are by no means isolated incidents in Anita's daily life.

　　一位城市里的“乡村护士”
    在民主德国的广大农村，谈起“乡村护士”，人们就联想起健壮的、有丰富医疗经验的妇女，背着医药箱，骑着自行车，从一个村庄奔到另一个村庄。不管天晴下雨或刮风下雪，她们总及时出现在农民家里，一心一意为农民的健康贡献自己的力量。这些“乡村护士”深受农民的尊敬和爱戴。
    阿尼塔·鲍莉茨，今年３５岁，也被称为“乡村护士”，不过她却在城里工作。她出色的工作和对病人和老人的百般体贴，也深受她管区内人民的尊敬和爱戴。
    ３年前，阿尼塔接受了医院分配，到医院的管区内当一名巡回护士。她对这项工作感到十分光荣，认为这样她可以充分发挥医学知识和全心全意为人民服务的精神。她负责的地段有四条街，她的服务对象多数是老年人，几乎所有病人的年龄都比她大一倍。从接受任务的第一天起，她就骑上自行车在这四条街上巡回照顾病人，有时甚至牺牲自己的休假为他们服务。
    她的服务工作范围实际已超出了一个护士的职责。每到一个病人家里，她按惯例量量血压，问一下病情外，还关心老人们屋子里的电冰箱是否完好？煤气灶漏气了没有？是否有人来帮她（他）们打扫屋子等等。然后，她都一一记在本子上，如发现问题，她就及时帮助解决。
    在巡回护理的过程中，她特别注意老人的倾诉，有时老人的儿孙们很久没有来看望了，她总用体贴的话语加以宽慰。她还经常为老人读亲人们寄来的信件。在管区内，有一对９３岁的老妪，两人相依为命已４０多年了，生活十分孤单。一年前，阿尼塔发现她们的生活状况后，几乎每天早晨都要来看看她们，为她们准备早餐。老人们不无夸张地说，“她煮的咖啡比一些高级咖啡厅的还好得多”。的确，她的到来给这两位老人的生活增添了快乐和希望。
    阿尼塔３年的辛勤劳动，博得了管区内病人特别是老人的称赞。一天，８４岁的克梅莉茨夫人亲自扎了一束鲜花，站在门口等着她的到来，以表示对这位白衣战士的感激之情。像克梅莉茨夫人的举动在阿尼塔的日常生活中决不是极个别的。
