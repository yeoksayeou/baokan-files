	The Xinjiang Television Station has just completed broadcasting the television series "Dream of the Red Chamber" dubbed and voiced in Uyghur, and has now started airing the television series "Journey to the West" in Kazakh. Even in the most remote towns, ethnic minority residents who do not understand a word of Mandarin can now watch domestic and foreign films dubbed in their native languages in movie theaters.

	The six-part television series "Liu Mingchuan, the First Governor of Taiwan," has been jointly produced by the Hefei Municipal Bureau of Culture, Huangshan Audio-Visual Publishing House, and Dalian Hongda Film and Television Center, and will be released domestically and internationally in early May. Liu Mingchuan was a patriotic general during the Guangxu era of the Qing Dynasty. In 1885, the Qing court announced the establishment of Taiwan Province, with Liu Mingchuan as the first governor. This television series reflects Liu Mingchuan's achievements in defending Taiwan against French aggression, developing and building Taiwan, and his unfortunate fate of being demoted and forced to return home, leaving his ambitions unfulfilled.

	The exhibition of works by the late famous Japanese ink painter Fujihara Ryozan opened at the Beijing Rongbao Gallery on the morning of May 2. Fujihara Ryozan was a student of the great master Qi Baishi. In 1938, at the age of 18, he came to Beijing and diligently studied under Qi Baishi. After returning to Japan in 1947, Fujihara integrated the styles and techniques of Qi Baishi, Japanese painting, and other Chinese painting schools, achieving breakthroughs and innovations, and forming a unique ink painting style characterized by "thickness."

	On the evening of April 30, the Zigong Lantern Festival, at the invitation of Wuhan City, opened the curtain on the large-scale cultural exchange lantern festival between Wuhan and Zigong in the picturesque Hanshui Middle Mountain Park. The exhibition is scheduled to last for 40 days.

    Δ新疆电视台刚刚播完用维吾尔语译制并配音的电视连续剧《红楼梦》，又开播了一部哈萨克语电视连续剧《西游记》。而在最偏僻的乡镇，一点汉语都听不懂的少数民族居民，现在也能在电影院里观赏到用本民族语言配音的中外影片。
    Δ六集电视连续剧《台湾首任巡抚刘铭传》，已由合肥市文化局、黄山音像出版社和大连宏大影视中心联合拍摄完毕，五月初将向国内外发行。刘铭传是清代光绪年间的爱国名将。一八八五年，清廷宣布台湾建省，刘铭传首任巡抚。这个电视剧反映了刘铭传抗法保台、开发建设台湾的功绩和他被清廷革职处分、被迫还乡、壮志未酬的遭遇。
