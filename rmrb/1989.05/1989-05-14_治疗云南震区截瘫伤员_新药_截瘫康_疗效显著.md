Every major earthquake around the world sends external injury-induced paraplegic patients to hospitals, and how to relieve their pain and help them recover has been a medical challenge. Recently, a team of medical workers from Jinzhou, Liaoning Province, known as the "Jie Tian Kang" research group, achieved remarkable results in their medical practice in the earthquake-stricken area of Lancang, Yunnan Province.

In March of this year, at the request of the State Civil Affairs Department and the Jinzhou City (a sister city of Kunming) Civil Affairs Bureau, a medical team consisting of three doctors from the Jinzhou Rehabilitation Hospital—Wang Jiyuan, Yang Fayu, and Tong Baochun—arrived at the Lancang County Hospital. They treated three paralyzed patients from the Lahu ethnic group who had become paraplegic due to spinal fractures caused by the earthquake. The doctors administered the traditional Chinese medicine pill "Jie Tian Kang" to the patients without using any auxiliary drugs. After three courses of treatment, by May 4th, two female patients (65-year-old Li Namo and 48-year-old Li Nahong) had regained sensation in their bowels and bladder, could sit up for extended periods, and were able to walk slowly with the aid of objects.

According to Dr. Wang Jiyuan, the drug is particularly effective for patients under 50 years old who have been paralyzed for less than a year. No toxic side effects have been found in clinical practice.

    新药“截瘫康”疗效显著
    本报昆明５月１４日电  记者钱江报道：世界上的每一次大地震都向医院送进了外伤性截瘫病人，如何使他们解除病痛，走向康复，成了医学难题。最近，由辽宁锦州市医务工作者组成的“截瘫康”研制组通过在云南澜沧地震灾区的医疗实践，取得显著疗效。
    今年３月，受国家民政部和锦州市（昆明的姐妹城市）民政局的委托，由锦州康复医院王纪元、杨发育、佟宝纯３位医生组成的医疗组来到澜沧县医院，治疗在大地震中因腰椎骨折造成下肢瘫痪的３位拉祜族截瘫病人。他们给病人服用中药丸“截瘫康”，不再使用辅助药物，经３个疗程的治疗，至５月４日，两名女病人（６５岁的李娜莫和４８岁的李娜荣）已恢复了两便感觉，能自行起坐较长时间，并能够扶物缓行片刻。
    据王纪元医生介绍，该药对５０岁以下，瘫痪一年以内的患者疗效尤其显著，在临床实践中未发现有毒副作用。
