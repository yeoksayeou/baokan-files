    Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met this afternoon in Zhongnanhai with a delegation from the Bulgarian Communist Party led by Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary M. Balyov. Zhao said that China's 10 years of reform have achieved considerable success, but there are still many problems, some of which are quite complex. Some problems have been solved, while others require further discussion.

    Zhao Ziyang said that the main issue in the economy is the appearance of significant inflation. This is due to both reform and development. The development aspect is that the scale has been too large, leading to a mismatch between demand and supply. The overall situation for the first four months of this year is good, with some results achieved, although this does not mean all problems have been resolved. If no other major issues arise, there will be a noticeable effect in controlling inflation this year. Once inflation is somewhat curbed, the reform will continue according to the original plan.

    Zhao Ziyang said that another issue in the reform is the relationship between economic system reform and political system reform. Without political system reform, the difficulties encountered in economic system reform will be hard to overcome. Of course, for a developing country like China, the pace of political system reform must be steady. The core of political system reform is the construction of democracy and the legal system.

    Comrade Balyov expressed admiration for the achievements of China's reform and construction.

    Department Head of the International Liaison Department, Zhu Liang, was present during the meeting.

　　赵紫阳会见保加利亚客人时指出    
    政治体制改革步子要稳
  　中心是民主和法制建设    
    没有政治体制改革，经济改革中的困难很难克服
    本报北京５月１０日讯  记者孙毅报道：中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天下午在中南海会见了由政治局委员、中央书记米·巴列夫率领的保加利亚共产党访华代表团时说，中国１０年改革已经取得了不少成绩，但是现在面临的问题不少，有些问题还是比较复杂的。有些问题我们已经找到了解决的办法，有些问题还要进一步探讨。
    赵紫阳说，经济方面的情况主要是出现了明显的通货膨胀。这既有改革方面的原因，也有发展方面的原因。发展方面的原因是摊子铺得太大，出现了需求和供应方面的不协调。今年１—４月份总的情况是好的，收到了成效，当然这不是说问题完全解决了。如果不发生其他特别问题，今年在治理通货膨胀方面会收到比较明显的效果。通货膨胀稍加遏制后，改革就会继续按原来的计划进行。
    赵紫阳说，改革的另一个问题是经济体制改革和政治体制改革的关系问题。如果没有政治体制改革，经济体制改革遇到的困难很难克服。当然，像中国这样一个发展中的大国，政治体制改革的步子要稳妥。所谓政治体制改革，中心是民主和法制建设。
    巴列夫同志对我国改革建设取得的成就表示赞赏。
