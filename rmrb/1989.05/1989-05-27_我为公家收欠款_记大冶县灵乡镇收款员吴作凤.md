Comrade, our Lingxiang Town enterprises are thriving like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, ranking first in the county for five consecutive years. The town praised me for my contributions, saying that I have collected overdue debts totaling 490,000 yuan for the public over five years. I am over 50 years old, and my hearing is a bit impaired. Receiving the honor and award makes me feel unworthy.

In 1983, during the wheat harvest season, the leadership assigned me to the enterprise office to collect overdue accounts. The town had just been established after the dissolution of the commune, and the finances were in a mess. I was responsible for collecting debts for all 16 enterprises in the town, dealing with both collective entities and individuals, and I was constantly on the move, busy all year round.

Six years ago, the Electrical Appliance Factory had 5,000 yuan borrowed by a neighboring machinery factory. The person in charge of the machinery factory later transferred to the county seat, and the new factory director wanted to evade responsibility: “A new official does not settle old cases.” I went to the county and found the person in charge. With evidence and witnesses, the factory director reluctantly returned the money. Just for the Electrical Appliance Factory, I collected over 30,000 yuan in cash over the years.

My brother-in-law's family owed the Enterprise Office 170 yuan. I went to their doorstep to collect the debt. My sister was furious: “The unit doesn’t ask, but you do! Others don’t press, but you do!” I replied, “Owing money without repaying is being a scoundrel. If I don’t collect, who will?” “Alright, alright, I’ll pay the remaining tens of yuan.” “You still owe 20 yuan in interest.” I insisted on waiting until my sister borrowed the money before leaving.

A local shop owner who had gone bankrupt owed the town-run Iron Mine 2,400 yuan. I wore out the doorstep but couldn’t collect the money. The shop owner said, “I’m not afraid of the debt collector, but I’m afraid of being penniless!” I was not afraid. Last September, I noticed 30 boxes of nails stacked in the shop, calculated that it was worth the debt amount, and quickly rented a car to take them away to settle the debt.

Collecting debts from city dwellers is different. I always go to their offices, present my introduction letter, and show the receipt. The office is busy with people coming and going. When they know there is a debt collector, they are afraid of losing face and quickly reach into their pockets.

To be honest, my son who is an official doesn’t want me to collect debts anymore, but I think differently. Although I am neither a party member nor an official, every time I have to argue with him: “There are so many overdue debts for the public. Should we just let them go? I am a person from Lingxiang Town, and I should do something for the town. If one person is afraid of hardship and two people are afraid of fatigue, who will collect the debts for the public?”

　　“我为公家收欠款”
    ——记大冶县灵乡镇收款员吴作凤
    程长
    同志唉，我们灵乡镇企业像连天竹子节节高，５年都在全县金榜前，镇里夸我立了功，说我５年多为公家收回内外欠款４９万元，我年纪５０多，耳朵有点背，受功领奖真有愧。
    １９８３年麦收时节，领导调我到企业办公室，交代我催收陈年帐。镇里刚撤公社建新摊，财务像乱麻，我为全镇１６家企业催收欠款，找集体、找个人，一年四季东跑西颠忙不赢。
    ６年前，电器厂被邻乡机械厂借走５０００元，机械厂经手人后来调县城，接任的厂长想抵赖：“新官不断旧案。”我上县找到了经手人。人证物证在，厂长乖乖还了钱。单为电器厂，我几年收还现金３万多。
    妹夫家欠企办１７０元，我上门收帐，妹妹气鼓鼓：“单位不讨你来讨，别人不催你要催！”我应嘴：“欠钱不还是痞子。我不讨帐哪个讨？”“罢罢罢，下欠的几十元都给你！”“还差２０元利息钱。”我硬等妹妹借齐才挪脚。
    本地一家七腾八倒的店主破了产，一直拖欠镇办铁矿２４００元。磨光了门坎就是收不到钱。店主说：“不怕你收帐的阎王，只怕我欠帐的精光！”我不怕，去年９月一天，我瞄准店堂里码着３０箱铁钉子，划算正值欠款数，赶紧租车一回拉走抵了债。
    找城里人收债又不同。我一律摸到办公室，拿出介绍信，亮出白纸条。办公室人来人往多，人家晓得有位讨帐客，面子上的人都怕败面子，哪个不赶紧摸袋子？
    不瞒你同志说，我那当干部的儿子好歹不要我再收帐，可我想的跟他不一样。莫看我一不是党员二不是官，每次还要跟他犟一犟：“公家那多外欠款，未必白白让它浪荡？我是灵乡镇上的人，总要为镇上做点事。一个嫌苦，两个怕累，该哪个去讨还公家的钱？！”
