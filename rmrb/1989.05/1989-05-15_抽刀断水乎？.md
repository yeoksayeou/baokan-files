Title: Can One Draw a Sword to Cut Water?

President Bush, under the pretext of "protecting American citizens and interests," ordered on May 11 the deployment of an additional 2,000 U.S. troops to Panama. The White House's abrupt action not only risks escalating tensions and potentially sparking a conflict between the U.S. and Panama, but also further destabilizes the political situation in Central America.

The White House's justification for this military move is that Noriega, the leader of Panama, interfered in the recent elections. Even if this were true, it does not justify the invasion of another country. It is clear to anyone with eyes that this is merely an excuse.

The United States has a history of using force in its "backyard" in Latin America, which has never been popular. After the Grenada incident, Latin American countries, especially those in Central America, have been wary of Uncle Sam's hegemony. If the White House recklessly attacks a small country like Panama, it will only deepen the rift between the United States and Latin American countries.

The White House's saber-rattling this time is aimed at controlling the strategically important Panama Canal. According to the Carter-Torrijos Treaty, a Panama-appointed administrator will take over the canal next January. Washington wants to remove the current Panamanian government, which it does not recognize, to ensure the canal operates according to its wishes. However, as the saying goes, "Can one draw a sword to cut water?" The waves stirred up by American military threats may end up destroying someone else's levees.

### 抽刀断水乎？

　　抽刀断水乎？
    布什总统以“保护美国公民和利益”为名，于本月１１日下令向巴拿马增派２０００名美国军队。白宫的这一断然举动，不仅有使剑拔弩张的美巴关系一触即发的危险，而且导致了中美洲政局更加动荡。
    白宫这次兴师问罪之由，乃巴拿马的诺列加最近在大选时从中舞弊。即使这点能成立，也不能成为派兵侵入别国的理由，明眼人看出这不过是欲加之罪何患无辞而已。
    美国在“拉美后院”诉诸武力，历来不得人心。格林纳达事件发生后，拉美国家特别是中美洲诸国，一直对山姆大叔的强权政治心有余悸。白宫如果贸然对巴拿马这样的弹丸小国动武，必然加深美国同拉美国家之间的矛盾。
    白宫这次鸿门舞剑，目的在于控制位于战略要冲的巴拿马运河。根据当年的卡特-托里霍斯条约，巴方指派的运河行政长官将于明年１月走马上任，华盛顿不趁早除掉自己拒绝承认的巴拿马现政府，便无法确保巴拿马运河按照美国的意愿运行。但是，抽刀断水水更流，美国武力威胁，激起的汹涌波涛究竟会冲毁谁家的堤坝，这可是很难说得准的。
