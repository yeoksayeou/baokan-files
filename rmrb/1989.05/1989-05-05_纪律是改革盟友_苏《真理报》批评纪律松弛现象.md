Discipline is an Ally of Reform
The Soviet "Truth" Newspaper Criticizes the Phenomenon of Loose Discipline

New China News Agency, Moscow, May 4 - The Soviet party newspaper today believes that mere talk, shirking work, and strikes will only cause serious economic losses and are detrimental to reform.

In the editorial "Discipline is an Ally of Reform," it is emphasized that loose labor discipline is one of the main reasons for the negative phenomena that have emerged during the reform. Soviets should rely on strengthening discipline and increasing labor productivity to improve the national economy and raise living standards.

The editorial states that some people only see that foreign production is good, but they do not see that foreign workers do not handle personal matters while on the job and do not drink alcohol. Currently, the Soviet market supply is poor, and there is a serious shortage of goods, which needs to be changed through the joint efforts of all regions and the hard work of every laborer.

The editorial calls on the people to correctly use democratic rights and work hard to support the reform. The editorial is written in response to the current phenomenon of "overheated political life" in Soviet society. Currently, there are people in the Soviet Union who are keen on forming unofficial organizations, holding rallies and marches, talking idly, and criticizing the leadership. Since this year, there have been strikes in places like Moscow, Ukraine, and Turkmenistan.

　　纪律是改革盟友    
    苏《真理报》批评纪律松弛现象
    新华社莫斯科５月４日电  苏联党报今天认为，空发议论、出工不出力和罢工都只会给经济造成严重损失，不利于改革。
    《真理报》在《纪律是改革的盟友》的社论中强调，劳动纪律松弛是改革中出现不良现象的主要原因之一。苏联人应靠增强纪律、提高劳动生产率来改善国民经济和提高生活水平。
    社论说，有人只看到外国生产搞得好，却看不到外国工人上班时不办私事，不酗酒。苏联目前市场供应差，缺货现象严重，要通过各地共同努力和每个劳动者辛勤工作来改变。
    社论呼吁人民正确使用民主权利，努力工作支持改革。社论是针对苏联社会当前存在“政治生活过热”现象而写的。苏联现在有人热衷于成立非正式组织、举行集会游行、空发议论和批评领导机构。今年以来，莫斯科、乌克兰、土库曼等地都陆续有人罢工。
