	The strange equation in Zhoukou:
	2.5 chickens = 1 egg
	Lǐ Tóngliáng

	Chicks priced at one jiao each are hardly selling, and one egg can be exchanged for two and a half chicks. This was the bizarre situation in the market of Zhoukou region in Henan Province in early May.

	This region's more than 600 chicken hatcheries and specialized households are all in the red this year, with debts ranging from a few thousand to over ten thousand yuan.

	According to officials from the regional animal husbandry bureau, the number of chicken hatcheries and specialized households in the region this year did not increase compared to last year, and the hatching volume remained at around 20 million chicks. By the end of May last year, chicks were still in high demand, selling for about five jiao each. This year, however, the price has plummeted.

	"Strange as it may seem, it's not really strange," said an official from the animal husbandry bureau. Livestock farming is dependent on crop farming, especially chicken farming, which relies mainly on grain as feed. Therefore, the price of chicks is an indicator of grain production. In recent years, farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain has waned, and grain production has stagnated. Last year, the region's grain production decreased by 1.8 billion kilograms. Even human food is insufficient, let alone feed for chickens.

	The second reason is the decrease in farmers' cash income. Last year, selling grain, cotton, and oil did not yield much cash, and urban construction projects were scaled back, cutting off a significant income source for those who went to the city to work in construction. In Xincheng County's Xinqiao Township, Wangzhuang Village, several households did not buy a single chick this year. When asked why, they said, "We can barely afford salt by tightening our belts and selling grain. Where would we get the money to buy chickens and feed?"

	The third reason is inadequate disease prevention. The region's annual chick survival rate is only about 50%. By July and August, chicken plague spreads, and many villages' chicks are nearly wiped out. Farmers angrily say, "The higher-ups don't help us solve the problem of preventing and treating chicken plague. Even if we can afford to buy chicks, we can't afford to keep them alive!" The disease prevention department also has its own difficulties. They say, "The two jiao per mu of animal and poultry disease prevention fees were cut because it was said to increase the burden on farmers. The little bit of disease prevention funds allocated from the budget each year is not even enough for personnel expenses. Moreover, it is now mid-May, and the chick disease prevention period has passed. The money still hasn't been allocated. With no money in hand, how can we buy vaccines for disease prevention of chicks?"

### 周口的怪等式——２．５只小鸡＝１个鸡蛋

　　周口的怪等式——
    ２．５只小鸡＝１个鸡蛋
    李同良
    雏鸡每只一角钱也很少有人问津，１个鸡蛋可换两只半雏鸡。这是５月上旬在河南省周口地区市场上出现的怪现象。
    这个地区的６００多个孵化小鸡的场和专业户今年个个赔款负债，少者三千五千，多者逾万元！
    据地区畜牧局的同志介绍，今年全区孵化小鸡的场和专业户较去年并未增加，孵化数量也基本保持在２０００万只左右，往年到５月底雏鸡还是抢手货，每只能卖５角左右。今年却跌惨了。
    “说怪也不怪。”畜牧局的同志说，养殖业依附于种植业，特别是养鸡，主要饲料是粮食。所以，小鸡价格是粮食生产的晴雨表。近几年，农民种粮积极性下降，粮食产量徘徊不前。去年全地区粮食减产１．８亿公斤，人的口粮尚且不足，喂鸡的饲料就更紧了。
    第二个原因是农民现金收入降低。去年卖粮、棉、油基本上没领到现钱，城里压缩基建，进城搞建筑挣钱也断了门路。项城县新桥乡王庄村有十几户人家今年一只雏鸡也没买，问他们为什么，他们说，我们吃盐还得靠紧腰带卖口粮，哪有钱买鸡买饲料？
    第三个原因是防疫跟不上。全区每年小鸡成活率仅占５０％，一到７、８月份，鸡瘟流行，好多村的小鸡基本要死光。农民气愤地说：“上边不帮助俺解决防治鸡瘟问题，俺买得起也死不起！”对这个问题，畜牧防疫部门也有自己的苦衷，他们说：每亩地收两角钱的畜禽防疫费，说是加重农民负担被砍掉了，全区每年从财政拨那一丁点防疫费，连人头费也不够。而且现在已到５月中旬，雏鸡防疫期已过，钱至今还没拨下来。手里没一分钱，用什么买疫苗给小鸡搞防疫？
