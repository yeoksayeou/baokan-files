Central government agencies' broad mass of cadres express determination to implement central important decisions

In recent days, the broad mass of cadres in central government agencies have studied the important speeches given by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party and Government Leaders' Meeting on May 19. They have expressed their firm support and determination to implement the important decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

Leaders and heads of departments in the Supreme People's Court have studied the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun and have promptly notified high people's courts across the country. They emphasized that all levels of people's courts must repeatedly and seriously study, deeply understand, unify thoughts, unify recognition, and unify actions, maintaining a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee. They must firmly implement and execute the decisions of the Central Committee. The Supreme People's Procuratorate has issued a notice to all levels of people's procuratorates across the country, requiring all levels of procuratorates and all procuratorial personnel to unshakably implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They must act swiftly, closely coordinate with public security and other relevant departments, and work wholeheartedly to stop the turmoil, use legal weapons to strengthen social order, and resolutely crack down on all illegal and criminal activities. Public security personnel have expressed their firm support for the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. They will guard their posts, implement the martial law order of the State Council, and clearly oppose the turmoil, maintaining the capital's public order and traffic order. The broad mass of cadres and workers in the State Security Department have expressed their determination to guard their posts and perform their duties in this struggle concerning the fate of the Party, the future of the country, and the interests of the people. They will make new contributions to safeguarding national security and maintaining stability and unity.

A small number of people with ulterior motives have attempted to exploit students' patriotic enthusiasm and the current difficulties and problems of our Party and state. They have incited the masses, stirred up trouble, and attempted to achieve their political goals of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and negating the socialist system under the conditions of turmoil. This is something they will never be able to achieve through normal democratic and legal channels. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, among other departments, have promptly listened to the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun regarding stopping the turmoil, stabilizing the situation, and restoring social order. They firmly support the important decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and require all cadres and workers to guard their posts and perform their duties, ensuring the smooth conduct of diplomatic and foreign economic and trade work.

To seriously implement the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, stop the turmoil, and quickly restore normal social order in the capital and across the country, the State Education Commission has dispatched cadres from the commission and bureaus to some colleges and universities and primary and secondary schools to conduct guidance work. They have ensured the smooth conduct of graduate assignments and new student enrollments. The Ministry of Health has made arrangements to promptly provide the State Council and various sectors of society with information about the possible spread of various infectious diseases in the capital and the comprehensive preventive measures taken. The State Planning Commission has further strengthened its leadership and coordination of the work to clean up the scale of fixed assets and the current production, striving to ensure the normal conduct of work and production. The Ministry of Energy has issued an emergency directive requiring all energy enterprises and institutions to ensure safe and reliable power supply. They must take effective measures to prevent anyone from using any excuse to storm coal mines, power plants, and oil fields. They require energy frontline workers, cadres, and intellectuals to guard their posts, perform their duties, and maintain normal work and production order. The Ministry of Metallurgy issued a notice on May 21 to key steel enterprises, requiring metallurgy frontline workers to guard their posts and work hard to maintain the good momentum of steel production since April. The Ministry of Railways requires all railway workers to fulfill their duties, overcome all difficulties, ensure the smooth flow of the railway arteries, and strive to maintain the normal transportation order of the railways. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has issued an emergency notice to postal and telecommunications departments across the country, requiring postal and telecommunications departments to ensure communication is smooth under any circumstances. The Civil Aviation Administration of China has issued an emergency notice to its subordinate regional management bureaus, provincial (autonomous region, municipality) bureaus, airlines, airports, and factories, requiring them to ensure the smooth conduct of civil aviation transportation production and work order, and ensure the safety and normal operation of flights. The Ministry of Textile Industry requires departmental staff and textile enterprise workers to guard their work posts, focus on textile production, overcome difficulties, and ensure market supply. The Ministry of Agriculture requires agricultural frontline cadres and workers to guard their posts, work actively, and make more contributions to achieving a bumper harvest this year. The Ministry of Commerce actively assists the Beijing Municipal People's Government in organizing and transporting grain and daily necessities for the capital's military and civilians.

The broad mass of cadres and workers in the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the General Office of the State Council have, over the past few days, worked hard to ensure the normal conduct of state affairs, ensuring smooth communication between the State Council and various departments and provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. The State Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Aerospace Industry, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Forestry, the Ministry of Communications, the State Sports Commission, the National Audit Office, and the State Economic Reform Commission, among other departments, have also organized serious study sessions. They have expressed their support for the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun and the important decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They have also proposed specific measures for implementation in conjunction with their respective departments' work.
