Guangdong Provincial People's Congress Criticizes Provincial Government for Inadequate Reduction of Fixed Asset Investment Projects
Urges Immediate Measures and Follow-Up Report

GUANGZHOU, May 7 — The progress of Guangdong's efforts to clean up and reduce fixed asset investment projects has been criticized by the provincial People's Congress. The provincial government recently reported on the situation to the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, but many committee members expressed dissatisfaction.

The provincial government's report stated that Guangdong has made significant progress in cleaning up and reducing fixed asset investment projects, but the report explicitly excluded Guangzhou and Shenzhen. Committee members were unhappy with this omission, stating that excluding these two cities does not reflect the full picture of Guangdong. For example, in 1988, Guangzhou and Shenzhen accounted for over 40% of the province's total fixed asset investments, making them a significant part of the overall investment. Although these cities have separate plans, the provincial government has a responsibility to supervise and inspect them and cannot simply ignore them.

The provincial government's report mentioned that self-financed construction projects and foreign-funded ongoing projects have largely been included in the plan. However, many members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress believed that ongoing projects have various types, and those that should be reduced must be firmly reduced, while those that should be maintained must still be maintained. The report did not provide a specific analysis of the projects that have been included in the plan, making it unclear whether they were all reasonably included and whether they all comply with the central government's decisions, thus failing to address the issue.

The committee members were particularly dissatisfied with the report's generalizations and lack of specific examples. Some committee members questioned whether the Agricultural and Forestry Building had been included in the plan and why a project designated for delayed construction had obtained a "day and night construction permit." The committee members also discussed the fact that in the first quarter of this year, the scale of fixed asset investments in state-owned enterprises in the province increased by more than 30% compared to the same period last year, while the national average decreased by 3.3%. This indicates that the current situation in Guangdong remains severe, and it is not appropriate to be complacent.

The members of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress demanded that the provincial government provide a supplementary report for review and urged the provincial government to make a firm decision, take effective economic and administrative measures in the near future, and reduce the scale of fixed asset investments in some regions that are still too large.

　　广东省人大批评省府压缩基建不力
    敦促近期采取有力措施再作专题汇报
    本报广州５月７日电  记者梁兆明报道：广东清理、压缩固定资产投资项目工作近况如何？日前，省政府向省人大常委会作了专题汇报，许多委员听了表示不够满意。
    广东省政府的汇报说，广东当前清理、压缩固定资产投资项目的工作取得了较大进展，但汇报者却一再说明不包括广州、深圳两市。委员们对此不满地说，不包括广州、深圳，又怎能反映广东全貌！以去年为例，广州、深圳的固定资产投资，占全省总数的４０％以上，是个大头。两市虽然计划单列，但省里有责任督促检查，不能放任不管。
    省政府在汇报中谈到，自筹基建和外资结转在建项目，大部分入了笼。省人大常委会许多委员则认为，在建项目有各种类型，该压的要坚决压，该保的还是要保，而汇报中对进笼子的项目不作具体分析，看不出是否都进得合理，又是否都符合中央的决定，因而不能说明问题。
    委员们更为不满的是汇报中概括多，典型事例少，一些委员责问农林大厦究竟有没有入笼，为什么确定缓建的这个项目却取得“日夜施工证”！委员们还谈到今年第一季度，全省的全民所有制固定资产投资规模比去年同期增长３０％多，而全国则下降３．３％，可见当前广东的形势仍然是严峻的，怎么能盲目乐观呢？
    省人大常委会委员们要求省政府作补充汇报，以便审议，并敦促省政府必须下定决心，拿出近期的有力的经济和行政措施，把某些地区仍然过大的固定资产投资规模压下来。
