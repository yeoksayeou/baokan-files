	△ The recently published "Eight Masters of Beijing Flavor Novels" by Cultural Arts Publishing House was first released at the Xinhua Bookstore in Wangfujing, with buyers lining up in long queues. Currently, there is an abundance of lowbrow publications, and pure literary works are often overlooked. The fact that so many readers are willing to spend over six yuan to purchase this book has moved and surprised the authors and critics who were present for the signing. This book features the works of eight renowned authors, including Lao She and Wang Zengqi, and depicts the customs and scenery of Beijing, the ancient capital.

	△ The Dutch guitar jazz band, humorously dubbed the "Seven Clumsy Gentlemen," performed for the capital's audience on the evening of May 1st at the Zhongshan Park Concert Hall. They played guitar pieces such as "Shawn's Nightmare," "Hey, My Bicycle," and "Annoying Fellow."

	△ The first authoritative large-scale documentary album about Mazu, titled "Mazu," was published by Fujian Education Publishing House on the eve of Mazu's 1030th birthday, which is celebrated as the "Goddess of Peace." The album is being distributed both domestically and internationally.

	△ The Chinese Modern Culture Association was recently established in Beijing. Over a hundred renowned experts, scholars, and cultural figures from across the country attended the meeting. The association appointed Zhou Guocheng and Xian Yan as honorary advisors.
