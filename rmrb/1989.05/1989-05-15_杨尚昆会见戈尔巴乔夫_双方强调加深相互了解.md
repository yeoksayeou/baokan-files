President Yang Shangkun today, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, extended a warm welcome to the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev, for his visit to China as the first Soviet leader in thirty years. He said, "We are very pleased that you and other distinguished Soviet comrades have come to Beijing for a visit."

The meeting between the high-level leaders of China and the Soviet Union was held this afternoon at the Great Hall of the People.

President Yang said, "Time flies. It has been a long time since our high-level leaders met, and there has been no opportunity for bilateral talks. The Chinese and Soviet peoples have deep friendships. Chairman Gorbachev's visit to China is of great significance. Not only do the peoples of China and the Soviet Union attach importance to it, but the international community also does. We need to understand each other, and you also want to understand us. He emphasized that Chairman Gorbachev's visit to China is the result of efforts by both sides."

Chairman Gorbachev thanked President Yang Shangkun for inviting him to visit China. He said, "The Soviet Union and the entire world are now in a very profound stage of change. At this very important stage, both China and the Soviet Union have shown wisdom and foresight and made contributions to improving relations. You just said that time flies, and that is indeed the case. Therefore, we cannot afford to waste any more time. On behalf of the Soviet leadership, I express regret for what happened in the past. To some extent, we are also responsible for what happened in that period. Now it is finally over, which is great. He expressed the hope that the Soviet Union and China should understand, respect, and trust each other.

President Yang briefed Gorbachev on China's reform and opening-up. He went on to say, "Whether it is economic reform or political reform, every country has its own specific circumstances. Without reform, China's development has no hope, and the old path cannot be followed. On the one hand, reform is needed, and on the other hand, there is no ready-made model for reform. Sometimes mistakes are inevitable in decision-making and problem-solving. Many things need to be experimented with and discussed, and there is no blueprint that everyone can follow.

President Yang also said that there is great potential for us to exchange views on reform. We are very interested in the Soviet Union's reform and hope that the Soviet Union's reform will succeed. Gorbachev also expressed great interest in what China is doing.

Gorbachev invited President Yang to visit the Soviet Union, and President Yang accepted the invitation with pleasure.

Finally, President Yang expressed his belief that Chairman Gorbachev's visit would certainly be a complete success.

Those present at the meeting included Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, Vice Premiers of the State Council Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian, as well as Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and other Soviet officials accompanying Gorbachev's visit.

　　杨尚昆会见戈尔巴乔夫    
    双方强调加深相互了解
    本报北京５月１５日讯  记者周象光、温宪报道：国家主席杨尚昆今天代表中国政府和人民对苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫在三十年后作为第一位苏联最高领导人来华访问表示热烈欢迎，他说：“你同其他尊贵的苏联同志来到北京访问，我们非常高兴。”
    中苏两国高级领导人的会见是今天下午在人民大会堂举行的。
    杨主席说，时间过得真快，我们两国高级领导人很长时间没有会面了，也没有可能进行双边会谈。中苏人民间有着深厚的友谊。戈尔巴乔夫主席访华有很重要的意义，不仅中苏两国人民重视，国际社会也很重视。我们非常需要了解你们，你们也同样愿意了解我们。他强调，戈尔巴乔夫主席访华是双方努力的结果。
    戈尔巴乔夫主席对杨尚昆主席邀请他访华表示感谢。他说，苏联及整个世界都正处于很深刻的变革阶段。在这个很重要的阶段中，中国和苏联都表现了英明和远见，在改善关系中都做出了贡献。你刚才说时间过得很快，实在是这样。所以我们不能再浪费时间。我代表苏联领导对过去发生的事情表示遗憾。在某种程度上说，对那一阶段的事我们也有责任。现在终于结束了，太好了。他表示希望中苏间要相互了解，相互尊重，相互信任。
    杨主席向戈尔巴乔夫介绍了中国改革、开放的情况。他接着说，不论是经济改革，还是政治改革，每个国家都有自己的具体情况。不改革，中国的发展就没有希望，老路是走不下去的。一方面要改革，另一方面，改革也没有现成的模式，有时免不了会出现一些决策上和处理问题上的失误。很多事要试验，要探讨，没有一个大家都能照搬的蓝图。
    杨尚昆还说，在改革方面，我们交换意见的可能性很大。我们对苏联改革很感兴趣，并希望苏联改革成功。戈尔巴乔夫也表示苏联对中国进行的事非常感兴趣。　　
    戈尔巴乔夫邀请杨主席访问苏联，杨主席欣然接受邀请。
    最后，杨主席表示相信戈尔巴乔夫主席的访问定能获得圆满成功。
    参加会见的还有全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲，国务院副总理田纪云、吴学谦以及随同戈尔巴乔夫来访的苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽等。
