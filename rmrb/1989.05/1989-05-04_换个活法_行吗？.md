Whether in modern cities or remote villages, whether in academic circles or among workers and farmers, or even among individual business owners, young people often say, "Let's change our way of living!"

"Changing our way of living" seems to be about changing our lifestyle, but in reality, it reflects a shift in our values. Some people feel disrespected for lacking academic credentials, so they pursue degrees; others feel stifled by being ordered around, believing their talents are wasted, so they seek "positions of power"; some feel their salaries are too low, so they quit their jobs to start businesses; others feel they can't learn advanced knowledge domestically and miss opportunities for fame and fortune, so they strive to go abroad; some simply give up all efforts and choose to "drift" through life.

However, regardless of how one "changes their way of living," most people often find themselves unsatisfied afterward. Those who pursue degrees often regret spending precious years of their lives on a mere piece of paper; those who seek "positions of power" find themselves with a bit of authority but living like "rats in a windbox," feeling even more constrained than before, and their supposed talents seem to dwindle after several rounds of competition and struggle; those who become wealthy through business often fear being labeled as "rich but heartless"; those who wander the streets of foreign lands often suffer from homesickness and struggle to integrate into the local culture. Those who choose to "drift" through life often feel envious or sigh in regret when they see others achieving remarkable success.

So, is there no truly satisfying way of living, whether one changes or not? Not necessarily. The key is to understand what you value most in life and then boldly pursue it, without complaining or feeling sorry for yourself just because you've faced hardships or seen others succeed easily. Once you understand yourself, you'll know what you truly want to do and can calmly and persistently work towards your goals.

Understanding what you value most in life is indeed not easy. However, this is precisely what every young person should strive to do first. You can live without self-awareness for a few years or even a decade, but you cannot live your entire life without it. Otherwise, whether you change your way of living or not, or how you observe and imitate others' ways of living, you will always feel that life is meaningless.

### “换个活法”行吗？

　　“换个活法”行吗？
    陕西省南郑县中医院  刘岩松
    无论是在现代化的都市，还是在偏远的乡村；不管是知识圈中，还是做工务农的，甚至个体经商者，青年人口中常会吐出一句：“换个活法！”
    “换个活法”，表面是生活方式的转换，实际上却是人生价值观念的变更。有人感到没有学历的标签被人瞧不起，便去奔文凭；有人受人指挥心里不顺畅，认为埋没自己的聪明才智，便去奔“官位”；有人是感到薪水太少，辞掉公职去经商；有的则是感到国内学不到什么高超的知识，难得一鸣惊人、缺少名利双获的机会，便去努力出国；有的放弃一切努力，干脆一日日“混”下去。
    然而，无论是怎样地“换法活”，绝大多数在“换”了之后又往往觉得不甚满足。奔文凭者，每每感到自己好几年珍贵时光被一张轻薄的纸片“抢”走而扼腕；奔到“官位”的，则为自己有了小权却做了“风箱里的老鼠”，活得更不比往日顺畅，而所谓的聪明才智，不知为何在几经交锋、拚搏之后不够用了；经商发财的，又常常害怕自己被人看成“为富不仁”；已经徜徉于异邦街头的呢，往往又为思乡之情所苦，常感难入异国文化圈中。凡此“混”人生的，则在耳闻目睹别人取得了惊人的人生业绩时，又忍不住咋舌，或忍不住心底慨叹一番。
    如此说来，是不是“换”与不“换”，都没有一个真正的好“活法”呢？其实不然。关键在于你应弄明白自己此生最看重什么，然后大胆地去追求，而不因自己受了磨难或看到他人轻取成功而自怨自艾，牢骚太盛。弄明白了自己，便清楚自己干什么才合心意，便能既心情安定、又锲而不舍地去做自己想做和该做的事。
    人弄明白自己最看重什么，确实并非易事。然而，这又恰是每一个青年第一要去做的事。可以没有自我把握地生活几年甚至十几年，但不能没有自我把握地生活一辈子。否则，无论换不换“活法”，或者怎样地看着别人的“活法”而换来换去，也总是会感到活得没味儿！
