Reading is my habit, so naturally, the library has become my friend. In recent years, I have felt that this "friend" is increasingly unable to meet my needs, often I seek help but it cannot respond.

Currently, our country's libraries are not only too few in number. Many government agencies, factories, and mines lack reading rooms, and workers cannot borrow books. Even some schools do not have books to lend! It is even harder to find a library in the vast rural areas, and organized book lending is out of the question. However, in such a situation, some libraries with rich collections do not open to the public. It is understood that some libraries with tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of books have very few borrowers, and some books, due to being undisturbed for years, are infested with bookworms and the pages have turned yellow. It is truly a waste to store books without managing them, or to manage them without lending them out!

Today, enlightened individuals are calling for the urgent improvement of the national quality! And the improvement of national quality relies on the improvement of cultural attainments. I believe that developing the library cause is beneficial for improving the national quality.

### 图书馆事业急待开发

　　图书馆事业急待开发
    读书是我的习惯，图书馆自然就成了我的朋友。近年来，我感到这位“朋友”已越来越力不从心了，往往我有求而它不能应。
    目前，我国的图书馆不但数目太少。一些机关、厂矿没有阅览室，职工借不到书，连有的学校也无书可借！广大农村更难找到图书馆，有组织的借阅书刊更谈不上。然而，就在这样的情况下，有些有丰富藏书的图书馆，却不对社会开放。据了解，有些藏书几万册、几十万册的图书馆，借阅者寥寥无几，有些书籍因常年不动，以致蛀虫满页、书籍发黄。对图书藏而不管，或管而不“放”，实在可惜！
    当今，有识之士纷纷呼吁全民素质亟待提高！而素质的提高有赖于文化修养的提高。我认为发展图书馆事业，对提高全民素质是有益的。
