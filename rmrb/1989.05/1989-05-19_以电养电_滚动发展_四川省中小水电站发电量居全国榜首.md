    Self-Sustaining Electricity Development: Sichuan Province's Small and Medium-Sized Hydropower Stations Lead the Nation in Power Generation

    According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on May 19th, "Whoever builds the power, benefits from it." Sichuan Province implements a policy of self-sustaining electricity development and rolling progress, mobilizing local enthusiasm for power generation. Small hydropower stations have developed rapidly. Currently, the total installed capacity of small and medium-sized hydropower stations built by local authorities in the province has reached 1.53 million kilowatts, with an annual power generation of 6.138 billion kilowatt-hours, ranking first in the nation.

    Sichuan Province is rich in water resources, with a total of 1,160 rivers, large and small. There are countless small tributaries and gullies, with an annual runoff of 450.8 billion cubic meters, equivalent to the water volume of nine Yellow Rivers, providing a natural advantage for hydropower development. In recent years, Sichuan Province has implemented a policy of "multiple entities building power, large, medium, and small together, self-built, self-managed, self-used." It stipulates that the profits from local power stations are entirely retained by the local authorities for the development of new power stations. This "snowball" method of power generation has led to a significant increase in the number of hydropower stations built by various regions in the province each year, with 29.1 million yuan used for self-sustaining electricity development.

    Today, local hydropower has become an indispensable part of Sichuan Province's power industry, and it has also strongly promoted local economic development. All counties, 95% of townships, 83% of villages, and 69% of households in the province have access to electricity.

　　以电养电　滚动发展    
    四川省中小水电站发电量居全国榜首
    据新华社成都５月１９日电（记者李正杰、凌云）“谁办电，谁受益”。四川省推行以电养电、滚动发展的政策，调动起地方办电的积极性，小水电得到迅速发展。目前，全省地方兴建的中小型水电站装机容量达到１５３万千瓦，年发电６１．３８亿度，跃居全国之首。
    四川省水能资源极为丰富，大小河流共有１１６０条之多，小支流和沟渠更是不计其数，年径流量达４５０８亿立方米，相当于９条黄河的水量，具有发展水电得天独厚的优势。为了充分发挥这一自然优势，近几年来，四川省实行了“多家办电，大中小并举，自建、自管、自用”的办电方针，规定地方办电站获得的利润，全部留给地方用于发展新电站。这种“滚雪球”的办电方式，促使全省各地办的水电站大幅度增加，每年用于以电养电的资金达到２９１０万元。
    如今，地方水电已成为四川省电力事业中不可替代的组成部分，它也有力地促进了地方经济的发展。
    全省所有的县、９５％的乡、８３％的村、６９％的农户用上了电。
