Title: The Sad State of Public Cultural Facilities

Among the calls to reduce construction investment, many grand buildings have been halted. However, when it comes to theaters, which are public cultural facilities in cities, many are also being stopped or delayed, which is puzzling.

Public cultural facilities in our country's urban construction have always been quite backward. In the past few decades, the situation has improved, but at the same time, there has been a distorted development: the construction of cinemas and theaters open to the public lags far behind that of "internal" auditoriums. In Beijing and other major cities, many large government agencies and military compounds have auditoriums that are well-equipped but too large and impractical. Some of these have been opened to the public in recent years, but they can only be used for lectures and film screenings and cannot meet the diverse cultural needs of society. It is certainly correct to propose that we should not build so many high-standard internal auditoriums in the future, but if we apply the same approach to public theaters and cinemas, it is worth considering. This is because our country currently has too few cinemas and theaters. Taking Beijing as an example, most performing arts troupes do not have their own performance venues. Without a theater, to perform, they have to frequently move, changing locations constantly, which not only wastes resources but also does not help in attracting a stable audience or enriching the repertoire through regular rotations to improve quality.

As far as I know, in many culturally developed countries, important cities have representative theaters that symbolize the civilization of that country and city. The world-renowned La Scala opera house in Milan, Italy, need not be mentioned. Others, such as the Paris Opera, the Royal Opera House in London, the Vienna State Opera, the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, and the recently built Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Center in New York, were not all built after these countries became rich. Often, they were built during times of hardship. After World War II, many European cities were destroyed by war, and theaters became ruins. Despite being in the initial stages of recovery, these countries' economies were very difficult, but they did not forget to provide theaters for the audience to appreciate art. West Germany had about 50 large and small opera houses before the war, and after reconstruction, the number doubled. Japan, which had long been criticized by the international arts community for lacking suitable opera and ballet theaters, has also caught up in recent years. The Tokyo Cultural Center, which includes a theater, concert hall, and exhibition hall, will be completed this year. In our country, some theaters have not only not increased but have decreased in recent years, forming a stark contrast with the luxurious hotels that have sprung up like mushrooms after rain.

Building theaters does not require luxury. The exterior and interior decoration of the Metropolitan Opera House in the United States are far inferior to those of some high-end hotels in Beijing. The famous Broadway theaters in New York City and the many medium and small-sized theaters scattered throughout American cities and towns are mostly old buildings. However, their interior lighting, ventilation, and lighting facilities for performances and audiences are far more advanced than ours.

I believe that one of the major mistakes in our country's urban construction over the years is the neglect of cultural facilities, investing limited funds in too many internal auditoriums, and recently building many luxurious hotels. In contrast, public cultural facilities are shabby and incomplete. It can be said that the current dilemma in theater construction is not primarily due to the country's financial resources, but rather due to poor planning, not focusing on the essentials.

### 公共文化设施的悲哀

　　公共文化设施的悲哀
    刘诗嵘
    在压缩基建投资声中，楼堂馆所纷纷落马。可是，作为城市公共文化设施的剧场，不少也要停建、缓建，这就令人费解了。
    我国城市建设中公共文化设施一向十分落后，近几十年情况有所改善，但同时又有了畸形的发展：向公众开放的影、剧院的建设远远落后于“内部”礼堂。北京和各大城市的许多大机关和军队大院多有设备较好然大而无当的礼堂，有些近年来虽已向社会开放，但只能听报告、放电影，无法适应社会多方面的文化需求。提出今后不要再修建那么多高标准的内部礼堂当然正确，但如果对公共剧场、影院等也“一刀切”，那就值得考虑了。因为我国现有影剧院太少。以北京为例，大多数表演艺术团体都没有自己的演出场地。没有剧场，要演出就只得常常搬迁，打一枪换一个地方，不仅劳民伤财，也不利于争取稳定的观众和通过定期的轮换演出以丰富上演剧目，提高质量。
    就我所知，世界上许多文化发达国家的重要城市，都有其代表性剧院，成为这个国家这个城市文明的象征。举世闻名的意大利米兰斯卡拉歌剧院自不待言，其他如巴黎大歌剧院、伦敦皇家歌剧院、维也纳国家歌剧院、莫斯科大剧院和后起的纽约林肯文化中心大都会歌剧院等，它们的兴建并不都是在这些国家富得流油之后，而往往是在艰苦创业之时。第二次世界大战后，欧洲许多城市毁于战火，剧院也成了废墟。尽管处在恢复初期，这些国家的经济都很困难，但他们都不忘给观众以艺术欣赏的剧场。联邦德国战前约有５０座大、小不等的歌剧院，经过重建，数量翻了一番。日本过去一直因为没有适用的歌剧、舞剧剧院而受到世界文艺界人士的鄙薄，近年也急起直追。东京文化中心—包括剧场、音乐厅、展览厅，今年即将落成。我们近年来有些地方的剧场不但没有增加反而减少，同雨后春笋般拔地而起的豪华饭店形成鲜明的对照。
    修建剧院何须豪华，美国大都会歌剧院的外观和内部装修远比不上北京的某些高级饭店。著名的百老汇大街众多的音乐剧院和遍布美国城乡的许多中、小型剧院，也大都是旧建筑。可是内部的采光、通风、照明等为演出和观众服务的设施都比我们先进得多。
    我认为，我国多年来城市建设上的重大失误之一，就是忽略了文化设施，而将有限的投资投向了过多的内部礼堂，近年来又大建豪华饭店。对比之下，公共文化设施简陋而不配套。可以说，当前剧院建设的困境，首先不是由于国家的财力，而在于考虑不周，钢没往刀刃上使。
