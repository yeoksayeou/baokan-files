Many people say that Zhang Shuxing, the director of the Finance Bureau of Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, is too rigid. If he were more flexible and generous with his approvals, people would line up to offer gifts and invitations. However, he adheres to principles like two cold iron rails, never bending, and no one can take even a single brick or tile from him.

Last February, an old cadre from the county's Construction Bureau went around to higher authorities, smoothed things out, and secured 10,000 yuan for building a private house. With the transfer notice and the leader's approval document in hand, he came to Finance Bureau Director Zhang Shuxing to handle the specific transfer procedures. However, Zhang Shuxing gave him a firm refusal! "This money cannot be transferred." The old comrade's face immediately darkened, and he anxiously said, "The money is allocated from above, you just handle it, it's not your responsibility." Zhang Shuxing said, "My responsibility is to uphold the state's financial system, how can I not be responsible?!"

Does Zhang Shuxing want to take my head, extort me, and make me show some gratitude? The old cadre thought, and had his son bring good cigarettes and fine wine to Zhang Shuxing's home. However, he wasn't even allowed in the door. The old cadre thought the gift was too small, so he personally went to plead, "Director Zhang, can we do it this way? You transfer the money, and we split it, each getting half!" Zhang Shuxing smiled and said, "If I wanted to make this kind of money, I would have done it long ago, but I would have also gone to prison long ago. You don't need to run around anymore, it's no use." From then on, the old cadre gave up. In recent years, Zhang Shuxing has encountered many such situations, but he has blocked them all. Just last year, there were more than ten people who curried favor with superiors to get public funds to build private houses, amounting to 260,000 yuan. These funds, when they reached the county, were naturally all "blocked" by Old Zhang.

In Zhang Shuxing's view, individuals taking advantage of the state is not allowed, and collective misuse of public funds is also not allowed. In early 1987, the county's biogas office, under the pretext of production funds, brought a report approved by county leaders to Zhang Shuxing, asking him to allocate 40,000 yuan. Zhang Shuxing looked at the report and said, "The county is not large, I haven't heard of any biogas projects, and the annual plan does not include your production items. If it is a temporary addition, it needs to be verified." The next day, he carefully investigated and found that the production project did not exist. The leaders of the biogas office had to tell the truth: they had agreed with the county leaders to use the production name to get the money, but in fact, they wanted to buy a car. Zhang Shuxing said, "This violates financial discipline, the money cannot be allocated, and I will explain it to the leaders." The other party thought they needed to treat Old Zhang to a meal, and that night, they prepared a lavish banquet. Zhang Shuxing declined due to illness, saying, "As long as it complies with the regulations, the money will be allocated without a banquet. You are also dragging the county leaders into this, isn't that adding to the mistake?" Later, despite their efforts, they still did not get the 40,000 yuan. In the past two years, Zhang Shuxing's pen, which adheres to principles, has blocked more than ten units from misappropriating special funds to buy cars and other controlled commodities, amounting to 530,000 yuan.

Zhang Shuxing corrects others by first correcting himself. A few years ago, his wife, according to policy, transferred from agriculture to non-agriculture and entered the city. His wife, who had worked in the fields for half her life, couldn't sit still at home and wanted to find a job. Many people were willing to help. A director said, "My subordinate service company is short of a custodian, come to me." Zhang Shuxing shook his head and said, "She doesn't know many characters, she can't go and pretend to be something she's not." A friend in charge of an enterprise said, "The quota and job type don't need you to manage, everything will be arranged by me." Zhang Shuxing still didn't speak, thinking that his wife was old and didn't meet the recruitment conditions, and he couldn't violate the principles.

Cadres and the masses praised, "Zhang Shuxing is indeed our clean financial official!"

　　财政“清官”   
    ——记项城县财政局长张树兴廉政二三事
    赵明
    许多人都说河南省项城县财政局长张树兴太古板，只要他手头松点，心眼活点，批款大方点，请客送礼的就会排队。可他坚持原则就像两条生冷的铁轨，一点也不走形，谁也休想从他手里多拿社会主义一砖一瓦。
    去年２月，县城建局一位老干部到上边四处游说，打通了“上关节”，从地区要回一万元建私房。他拿着上边的拨款通知和领导的批文，来找财政局长张树兴办理具体“划拨”手续。谁知张树兴给他个“顶门炮”！“这款不能拨。”这位老同志脸色立刻由晴转阴，焦急地说：“款是上边拨下来的，你只经经手，又没你的责任。”张树兴说：“我的责任是坚持国家财政制度，怎能没有我的责任？！”
    张树兴是不是想拿我的大头，敲我的竹杠，要我去表示表示？那位老干部想到这里，让儿子带上好烟名酒送到张树兴家，谁知屋门也没让进。这位老干部认为是送礼太少，便亲自登门相许：“张局长，我那笔建房款这样行不行，你拨了，咱俩一分为二，各得一半！”张树兴笑着说：“我要是想发这财早就发了，可我也早就进监狱啦。你就不要再跑啦，跑也没用。”从此，这位老干部便死了心。这几年，张树兴碰到的这种情况多啦，可都一一被他挡住。仅去年，就有十几个人讨好上级，要来公款建私房，金额达到２６万元。这些款来到县里，都理所当然地被老张一一“卡”住。
    在张树兴这里，个人占国家的便宜不行，集体乱花公款也不行。１９８７年初，县沼气办公室以生产用款为由，拿着县领导批复的报告要张树兴拨款４万元。张树兴看了报告说：“一个县不大，没听说什么沼气工程，年度计划并没列你们的生产项目，如是临时增加的要核实一下。”第二天，他认真走访调查，发现那个生产项目根本不存在。沼气办公室领导只好实话实说，他们已与县领导说好，以生产名义要钱，实际上要买辆小车。张树兴说：“这样做违犯财政纪律，款不能拨，领导那里我去解释。”对方以为需要请老张一场，当晚摆好一桌丰盛的酒席。张树兴推病没去，他说：“只要符合规定，不摆酒席照样拨款，你们这样做也把县领导也牵进去，不是错上加错吗？”后来，对方尽管又做了不少“努力”，但还是没有把四万元钱要到手。近两年，张树兴这支坚持原则的笔，挡住挪用专项款买小车和其它控购商品的单位十几家，金额达５３万元。
    张树兴正人先正己。前几年，他妻子按照政策农转非，进了城。干了半辈子庄稼活的老伴在家坐不住，想找个活干，许多人又愿意帮这个忙。有一位局长说：“我下边的服务公司正缺个保管员，来我这吧。”张树兴摇摇头说：“她识字不多，不能去滥竽充数”。一位在企业负责的朋友说：“指标和工种都不用你管，一切由我安排吧。”张树兴还是不开口，他认为老伴年龄大，不够招工条件，不能违犯原则。
    干部群众称赞道：“张树兴真是咱们的财政清官啊！”
