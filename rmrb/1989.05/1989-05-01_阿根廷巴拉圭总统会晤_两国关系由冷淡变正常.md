Argentine and Paraguayan Presidents Meet
Two Countries' Relations Move from Cool to Normal

BUENOS AIRES, April 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Raúl Alfonsín and Paraguayan President Andrés Rodríguez held a meeting on April 26 in a border city between the two countries and issued a joint statement. This was the first time in 12 years that the heads of state of these two neighboring countries had met, marking a shift from long-term cool relations to normalcy.

The joint statement expressed the two presidents' desire to strengthen political and economic relations between the two countries and announced the establishment of a bilateral commission for political consultation and integration composed of officials from both sides. The statement said that the democratization process in Latin America is a decisive driving force for the rapid establishment of new and effective forms of cooperation and unity in the region. President Alfonsín also expressed his belief that the general election to be held in Paraguay on May 1 will lay the foundation for the establishment of a democratic system.

Argentina and Paraguay are neighboring countries. In the past, due to political reasons, relations between the two countries were cool. During the rule of former President General Stroessner, Paraguay's political situation in the region was quite isolated. In January of this year, General Rodríguez staged a military coup, ending Stroessner's nearly 40-year rule. The new government decided to hold elections on May 1. General Rodríguez, as the candidate of the ruling party, is participating in the election.

The meeting between Alfonsín and Rodríguez is seen as an affirmation of Paraguay's democratization process. With this as an opportunity, Paraguay will gradually emerge from its politically isolated state.

　　阿根廷巴拉圭总统会晤    
    两国关系由冷淡变正常
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯电  记者李志明报道：阿根廷总统阿方辛和巴拉圭总统罗德里格斯４月２６日在两国边境城市举行会晤，并发表联合声明。这是这两个邻国的元首１２年来第一次举行会晤，标志着两国关系由长期冷淡走向正常。
    两国总统的联合声明表达了两位总统密切两国政治、经济关系的愿望，宣布将设立一个双方官员组成的政治协商和一体化委员会。声明说，拉美民主化进程对迅速建立本地区合作与联合的新的有效的形式是一个决定性的推动力。阿方辛总统并表示，相信５月１日巴拉圭即将举行的大选必将为确立民主体制奠定基础。
    阿根廷和巴拉圭是近邻，过去由于政治原因两国关系冷淡。前总统斯特罗斯纳将军执政期间，巴拉圭在本地区政治处境十分孤立。今年１月，罗德里格斯将军发动军事政变结束了斯特罗斯纳长达近４０年的统治。新政府决定于５月１日举行大选。罗德里格斯将军作为执政党的候选人参加竞选。
    阿方辛与罗德里格斯的会晤被认为是对巴拉圭民主化进程的肯定，以此为契机，巴拉圭将逐步走出政治孤立的状态。
