Ruili, a border city, is located in the southwestern corner of Yunnan Province, facing Myanmar across the river. This place was once part of the ancient Silk Road in southwestern China, but for a long time, the banks of the Ruili River were desolate.

Reform and opening-up have brought prosperity to Ruili. In just a few years, the border port has opened, attracting overseas compatriots, foreign businessmen, and various merchants, making trade very active. If you ask which industry in Ruili has developed the most? Counting on your fingers, telecommunications would surely be at the top.

The reporter learned from the Yunnan Provincial Post and Telecommunications Bureau that in Yunnan, Ruili, with a population of nearly 80,000, is the county with the most increased demand for telecommunications in recent years. In 1988, the number of telegrams sent and received was 212,000, an increase of 4.2 times compared to 1984, before the port opened. International telegrams increased by 135 times. The volume of long-distance telephone calls reached 291,000, an increase of 2.4 times compared to 1984. The number of international calls connected was 2,075, an increase of 72 times compared to 1984. International calls here have already reached 13 countries and regions in Southeast Asia, Western Europe, North America, and Oceania.

It goes without saying that economic prosperity has promoted the development of the telecommunications industry. In 1988, Ruili's telecommunications business income reached 963,000 yuan, accounting for 68% of the local post office's business income. Despite this, the growth in telecommunications business still cannot meet the needs of economic development. Fortunately, the people of Ruili have already realized the significance of the telecommunications industry to economic development. The number of telephone lines here has increased from 14 in 1984 to 25, and Chinese code machines have been added. Two long-distance semi-automatic dialing lines from Ruili to Kunming have been opened. Currently, a comprehensive telecommunications building covering 2,700 square meters is under construction. By this time next year, Ruili and its sister city, Tengchong, will be able to use programmed control telephones, directly dialing across the country.

    瑞丽电信四通八达
    本报昆明5月30日电  记者钱江报道：边城瑞丽坐落在云南省西南角，与缅甸隔江相望。这里曾是中国西南的丝绸古道，但在很长一段时间里，瑞丽江边冷落过。
    改革开放为瑞丽带来了经济的繁荣。短短几年间，边境口岸开放了，境外边民、海外侨胞和各路客商云集，贸易十分活跃。若问瑞丽各业发展谁家显著？屈指一数，准有电信业。
    记者从云南省邮电局得悉，在云南，近8万人口的瑞丽是近年来电信需要量增加最多的县。1988年往来电报21.2万份，比口岸开放前的1984年增长4.2倍，国际电报则增加了135倍。长途电话交换量达29.1万张，比1984年增长2.4倍，接通的国际电话为2075张，比1984年增长72倍。这里的国际电话已经通达东南亚、西欧、北美、大洋洲等13个国家和地区。
    不用说，是经济繁荣促进了电信业的发展。1988年，瑞丽的电信业务收入达96.3万，占当地邮局业务收入的68％。尽管这样，电信业务增长量还是不能满足经济发展的需要。好在瑞丽人已经意识到电信业对经济发展的意义，这里的电话线路已从1984年的14条增至25条，还增加了中文译码机，开通了瑞丽至昆明的长途半自动拨号线路2条。眼下，一座占地2700平方米的电信综合楼正在兴建。到明年此时，瑞丽，还有它的姐妹城市畹町，就能用上程控电话，直拨全国各地了。
