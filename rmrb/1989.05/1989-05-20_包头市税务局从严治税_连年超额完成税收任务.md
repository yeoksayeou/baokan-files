Baotou City Tax Bureau Strictly Enforces Taxation and Exceeds Annual Tax Collection Targets

A businessman from Shanxi who tried to bribe a tax collector with 50 yuan was turned down. The businessman remarked, "You people in Baotou are really strict." The Baotou City Tax Bureau has consecutively completed the national tax collection targets for three years. From January to April this year, the bureau collected 27,952.5 million yuan in taxes, an increase of 40.87% compared to the same period last year.

The Baotou City Tax Bureau has strict requirements for its tax personnel and promptly addresses any disciplinary issues. Early this year, two tax collectors were dismissed for accepting bribes of 800 yuan and misappropriating tax funds of 1,000 yuan. A former deputy director of the Third Tax Bureau was sentenced for accepting bribes of 5,000 yuan by using his position to help someone purchase aluminum ingots.

At the same time, the Baotou City Tax Bureau has established and improved a comprehensive tax collection system, strengthened mutual oversight, and blocked channels for personal gain. Each tax collection bureau has set up personnel supervision departments and tax inspection teams, and each tax office has appointed part-time supervisors, forming a supervision network. They have also made tax laws, collection, penalties, exemptions, and discipline public, increasing the transparency of tax work. The municipal bureau and each tax collection bureau have set up hotlines and suggestion boxes for reporting, distributed letters seeking opinions, regularly visited taxpayers, and appointed over 300 integrity supervisors among the taxpayers.

　　包头市税务局从严治税
    连年超额完成税收任务
    新华社呼和浩特五月十九日电  （通讯员钱咏虹）一名山西来的拉粉条个体户塞给协税员五十元钱被拒绝了。这位个体户说：你们包头真严。包头市税务局已连续三年超额完成国家下达的税收任务。今年一至四月，完成税收二万七千九百五十二点五万元，比去年同期增长百分之四十点八七。
    包头市税务局对税务人员要求极严，发现违纪问题及时处理。今年初，两名协税员因受贿八百元和挪用税款一千元被开除；原三分局一名副局长利用工作之便帮助他人购买铝锭，从中受贿五千元，被依法判刑。
    与此同时，包头市税务局建立健全了一整套税收制度，加强了相互制约，堵塞了谋私渠道。各征管局都设立了人事监察股、税务稽查队，各税务所都配备了兼职监察员，形成了监督网络。他们还把税法、征管、处罚、减免、纪律公开，增强了税收工作的透明度。市局及各征管局都设立了举报电话、举报箱，散发征求意见的公开信，定期走访纳税人员，并在纳税人员中聘请了三百多名廉政监督员。
