Imported cosmetics have gradually taken over the shelves in various local department stores. Recently, a relevant official from the Ministry of Light Industry stated: Foreign products have impacted domestic famous and high-quality cosmetics, as well as the national industry, leading to the shutdown of several perfume factories.

According to a report by the *Market News* today: In several large department stores in Beijing, cosmetics from France, the United States, Britain, Thailand, Malaysia, and other countries are everywhere, truly dazzling. There are series from French brands like Avon and Shiseido, American No. 1 series, Japanese hair care products, British Summer's Eve lotion, Malaysian Yong Fang high-end cosmetics, as well as soaps and perfumes from the U.S., France, and Japan, with over a hundred varieties.

At the cosmetics counter in the Lufu Department Store, the reporter noticed that the Zirolan cosmetics counter was quiet, while the foreign cosmetics counter was bustling. It is understood that there are over 60 kinds of French perfumes alone here, with shockingly high prices. A bottle of Yves Saint Laurent perfume costs 132 yuan, a bottle of Dior perfume costs 167 yuan, and there are even some over 200 yuan, with each bottle containing only a few dozen milliliters, much more expensive than domestic perfumes.

An insider told the reporter that most of these foreign products come from the foreign trade departments in Guangdong and Fujian, and some are smuggled goods. Imported cosmetics not only dominate the Beijing market but have also flooded the markets in Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Harbin, and many other major cities. Recently, the Ministry of Light Industry held a meeting in Hangzhou to issue permits for skincare cosmetics, where 653 cosmetics manufacturers unanimously called for "Save Domestic Products." They angrily said that domestic cosmetics must undergo multiple strict inspections before they can be produced, while imported cosmetics can be placed on the shelves without any procedures, which is an irresponsible attitude towards consumers.

　　香水香皂美容霜　何须也用舶来品    
    进口化妆品充斥市场    
    六百多化妆品厂家呼吁“救救国货”
    本报讯  进口化妆品已逐渐挤占各地商店的化妆品柜台。日前，轻工业部有关负责人说：洋货冲击了国产名优化妆品，也冲击了民族工业，一批香精厂已被迫停产。
    据《市场报》今天报道：在北京几家大百货商店，来自法、美、英、泰国、马来西亚等国的化妆品处处可见，真可谓琳琅满目。有法国的爱琪美、诗丽姬系列，美国一号系列，日本发王牌洗发护发液，英国的夏士莲润肤露，马来西亚永芳高级美容霜，还有美、法、日的香皂、香水，品种不下百种。
    在隆福大厦化妆品专柜，记者看到紫罗兰化妆品柜台生意清淡，洋化妆品柜台却生意兴隆。据了解，这里仅法国香水就有６０多种，价格贵得惊人。一瓶伊丽顿香水１３２元，狄玛华香水１６７元，还有２００元以上的，一瓶只几十毫升，比国产香水贵好多倍。
    知情人告诉记者，这些洋货多半来自广东、福建的外贸部门，也有走私货。进口化妆品不但充斥北京市场，也已充斥上海、天津、南京、杭州、广州、沈阳、哈尔滨等许多大城市的市场。不久前，轻工业部在杭州举行护肤类化妆品发放许可证会议，到会的６５３个化妆品厂家一致发出“救救国货”的呼声。他们气愤地说，国产化妆品要经过多次严格检测才能投产，而进口化妆品不需任何手续就可上柜台，这是对消费者不负责任的态度。
