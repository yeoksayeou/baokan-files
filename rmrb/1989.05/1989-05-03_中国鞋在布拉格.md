Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 3rd.

A store specializing in Chinese shoes opened in Prague today, marking the first store in Czechoslovakia dedicated to selling Chinese goods.

Czechoslovakia is renowned worldwide for its shoe production, with over a hundred shoe stores in the capital city of Prague alone. The Chinese shoe store stands out with its unique styles and varieties.

At the opening ceremony, Novotný, the deputy general manager of the Prague Shoe Company, stated that the establishment of this store aims to centralize the sale of various types of shoes imported from China, further enhancing the friendship and trade between the two nations.

The Chinese shoe store is located near the historic Old Town Square on Kozí Street. The store's sign, featuring the words "Chinese Shoe Store" in gold and a friendly panda image, is particularly eye-catching. In the approximately 30-square-meter store window, a variety of Chinese shoes are displayed, including elegant and comfortable slippers, children's shoes with colorful prints, lightweight sports shoes, travel shoes, and stylish leather shoes.

Novotný pointed out the children's shoes and sports shoes to the reporter, noting that these types of shoes are popular due to their soft soles and high-quality craftsmanship. Chinese leather shoes are also well-received, but the quality of some shoes needs improvement.

Even as the opening ceremony for the Chinese shoe store was taking place, many customers were already waiting outside, eager to make purchases.

Czechoslovakia produces over 120 million pairs of various types of shoes annually, with half of them exported. In recent years, to meet the domestic consumers' demand for a variety of shoe styles and colors, the country has been increasing its import quantities. Last year, it imported over 7.6 million pairs from China alone, and this year, the number is expected to increase further.

　　中国鞋在布拉格
    新华社布拉格５月３日电  （记者刘天白）布拉格市一家专售中国鞋的商店今天在这里开张，这是捷克斯洛伐克全国第一家专门经营中国商品的商店。
    捷克斯洛伐克是驰名世界的皮鞋生产大国，在首都布拉格有鞋店上百家，中国鞋店以它的品种和式样独树一帜。
    布拉格皮鞋公司副总经理诺沃提尼在开张仪式上讲话说，开设这家商店是为了集中出售从中国进口的各类鞋子，进一步增进两国人民的友谊和贸易。
    中国鞋店座落在历史悠久的老城广场近处的科泽大街上。“中国鞋店”四个金色的大字和形态憨厚的熊猫图像格外引人注目。在约有３０平米商店的橱窗中，陈列着各式各样的中国鞋：雅致舒适的拖鞋、印着彩图的童鞋、轻便的运动鞋、旅游鞋和款式新颖的皮鞋。
    诺沃提尼指着童鞋和运动鞋告诉记者，这类鞋鞋底柔软，加工精良，深受欢迎，中国的皮鞋也颇受青睐，但一些鞋的质量有待提高。
    在中国鞋店举行开业仪式之时，就有不少顾客等在店外希望购买。
    捷克斯洛伐克每年生产各类鞋１．２亿余双，其中一半出口。近年来，为了满足国内消费者对鞋类花色品种的需求，不断增加进口数量。去年仅从中国就进口７６０多万双，今年可望进一步增加。
