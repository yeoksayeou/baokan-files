	The Soul of a Bird
		Liang Shangquan

	Do not fear me, I am the soul of a bird.
	I traversed the vast ocean, coming to Qinghai Lake, coming to Bird Island.
	I unfortunately died in this strange land.
	Yet I can still befriend birds, associate with birds, and write about birds.
	I can still investigate the lives of birds, their habits, and their secrets.
	I can still observe birds' love, their incubation, and their nurturing of their young.
	I can still listen to birds' calls, their songs, and their choruses.
	I can still rest with birds, sleep with birds, and dream with birds.
	All my life I have been dealing with birds, feeling as if I have grown a beak, wings, and feathers.
	Do not think I am truly dead; my soul has soared with the birds into the blue sky, ascending to the heavens. I should be one of the easiest to see God's children.
	If someone comes to my grave, do not lament my misfortune, do not sigh over my loneliness, do not pity my solitude, do not!
	Just when counting the flock of birds, consider me as one of them, a bean goose, a black-necked crane, a gull, a swan, or any bird, and that will be enough consolation.
	I am fortunate to be buried in the kingdom of birds!

　　鸟魂
    梁上泉
    不要惧怕我，我是鸟之魂。
    我远涉重洋，来到青海湖，来到鸟岛。
    我不幸死在这陌生的异域。
    可我仍然能以鸟为友，以鸟为伍，以鸟为书。
    仍然能探究鸟的生活，鸟的习性，鸟的秘密。
    仍然能观察鸟的恋情，鸟的孵蛋，鸟的育儿。
    仍然能谤听鸟的呼唤，鸟的飞鸣，鸟的合唱。
    仍然能随鸟而栖，伴鸟而眠，同鸟而梦。
    我一生都在和鸟类打交道，感到自己也长上了嘴喙，长上了翅膀，长上了羽毛。
    不要以为我真的死了，我的灵魂已随鸟儿高翔碧空，升上天界。我应该是最容易见到上帝的子民。
    如果有谁到我墓前，不要衰掉我的不幸，不要悲叹我的孤独，不要怜悯我的寂寞，不要！
    只要在查数鸟群时，把我当作它们中的一只，一只斑头雁，一只黑颈鹤，一只鱼鸥，一只天鹅，或任何一只鸟儿就足以自慰了。
    我有幸埋在这鸟的王国！
