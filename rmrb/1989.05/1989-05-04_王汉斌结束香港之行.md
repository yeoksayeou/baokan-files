Wang Hanbin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, concluded his two-week visit to Hong Kong today. He departed by train this morning to return to the mainland.

Wang Hanbin and his delegation came to Hong Kong specifically to solicit opinions from various sectors of Hong Kong on the draft of the "Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China."

Wang Hanbin issued a written statement at the Kowloon Train Station, saying, "During this consultation, many opinions were raised regarding the political system, which is a good phenomenon. There are still differing views on the political system, and we hope that through discussion, we can gather wisdom, coordinate opinions, and find a solution that is conducive to the gradual development of a democratic political system and to the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong. In the future, there will be two more delegations from the mainland coming to Hong Kong to further solicit opinions. We hope that through everyone's joint efforts, we can find a better solution."

During this visit, Wang Hanbin and his delegation participated in more than 30 seminars and met with over 860 people from various sectors.

Wang Hanbin pointed out that many good opinions were raised regarding the draft of the Basic Law, reflecting that some parts of the draft need to be revised or supplemented. Some opinions are very insightful and need to be carefully studied by the drafting committee to improve the draft.
