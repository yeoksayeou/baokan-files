The Central Office Party Committee's Letter of Condolence to Martial Law Troops. The full text is as follows:

Dear Martial Law Troops Officers and Soldiers:

You have worked hard!

For the peace of the capital, for the long-term stability and prosperity of the Republic, you have been entrusted with the important task of martial law in parts of Beijing. In this serious political struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the state, you have stood firm, held high the banner, loved the people of the capital, loved the young students, and loved every blade of grass and tree in the capital. Your righteous actions have greatly boosted the morale of the people of the capital and deterred a very small number of people with ulterior motives. You are truly the people's army, truly the iron wall of the Republic.

The righteous army cannot be insulted. Over the past ten days, to complete the sacred martial law mission entrusted by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, you have endured sun and rain, wind and hardship, and even had to bear the insults, beatings, and slander from a very small number of people with ulterior motives. But you have always maintained high morale and shown a high level of political awareness. With your actions, you have won the trust and support of the people of the capital. We firmly believe that all conscious citizens of the Republic will understand and support you, and your martial law mission will definitely be successfully completed.

We, the Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and staff of the Central Office, will take you as our example, firmly support the correct decisions and effective measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil, seriously study the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun on May 19th, strictly observe discipline, be loyal to our duties, and work diligently for the Party Central Committee. Let us, in different positions, strive for one goal—to stop the turmoil and maintain a stable and united situation.

Central Office Party Committee

    正义之师不可侮。十多天来，你们为了完成党中央、国务院和中央军委交给的神圣的戒严任务，日晒雨淋，风餐露宿，甚至还要忍受一些不明真相的人的谩骂、殴打和极少数别有用心的人的造谣中伤。但你们始终保持了高昂的士气，表现出了很高的政治觉悟。你们以自己的实际行动赢得了首都人民的信赖和支持。我们坚信，一切有觉悟的共和国的公民，都会理解、支持你们，你们担负的戒严任务也一定会胜利完成。
    我们中央办公厅的共产党员、共青团员和工作人员，决心以你们为榜样，坚决拥护党中央、国务院为制止动乱所采取的正确决策和得力措施，认真学习李鹏、杨尚昆同志5月19日的重要讲话，严守纪律，忠于职守，兢兢业业地为党中央服好务。让我们在不同的岗位上，为了一个目标——制止动乱，维护安定团结局面而奋斗。
