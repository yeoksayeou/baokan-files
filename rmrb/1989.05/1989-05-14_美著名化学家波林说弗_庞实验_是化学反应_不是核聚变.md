Yesterday, the British journal *Nature* published a letter from the renowned American chemist Linus Pauling. In the letter, Pauling stated that the results obtained by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons in their electrolysis experiments are due to chemical reactions, not nuclear fusion.

The 88-year-old Pauling won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1953. He explained that during the electrolysis of heavy water using a palladium cathode, deuterated palladium is produced. This unstable compound begins to decompose, releasing a large amount of heat.

Since Fleischmann and Pons announced on March 23 that they had achieved nuclear fusion in an electrolytic cell, physicists and chemists have been divided in their debates over cold fusion. The American Chemical Society has highly praised cold fusion, while the American Physical Society has almost unanimously taken a negative stance. On April 8, at a special meeting of the Electrochemical Society in Los Angeles, Fleischmann and Pons admitted that there might be errors in their experiments. However, Fleischmann still insists that nuclear fusion occurred in their experiments.

### 美著名化学家波林说弗—庞实验　是化学反应　不是核聚变

　　美著名化学家波林说弗—庞实验
  　是化学反应　不是核聚变
    新华社伦敦５月１２日电（记者王国瑞）昨天这里出版的《自然》杂志发表了美国著名化学家莱纳斯·波林的一封信，他在信中说，马丁·弗莱希曼和斯坦利·庞斯在电解实验中获得的结果，是化学反应，不是核聚变。
    现年８８岁的波林曾于１９５３年获诺贝尔化学奖。他解释说，在用钯做阴极对重水的电解过程中，产生氘化钯。这种不稳定的化合物开始分解，释放出大量的热。
    自从弗莱希曼和庞斯３月２３日宣布在电解电池中获得核聚变后，物理学家和化学家在关于冷核聚变的辩论中阵线分明。美国化学学会高度评价冷核聚变，而美国物理学会则几乎一致持否定态度。弗莱希曼和庞斯４月８日在洛杉矶举行的电化学学会特别会议上承认，他们的实验可能有错误。但是弗莱希曼仍坚持认为，在他们的实验中发生了核聚变。
