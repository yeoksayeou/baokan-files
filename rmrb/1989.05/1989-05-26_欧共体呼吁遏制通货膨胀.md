The European Community Commission today issued a warning about the further rise in the inflation rate within the Community.

In a statement, the Commission's Vice-President for Economic and Financial Affairs, Henning Christophersen, urged member states of the Community to take firm action to prevent a temporary acceleration of inflation from leading to a more severe inflationary trend in the future.

According to official statistics, in the 12 months up to March this year, the Community's inflation rate, calculated on an annual basis, rose from 3.2% to 5%. Preliminary statistics indicate that in April this year, the Community's annual inflation rate further increased to 5.4%.

The Community Commission believes that the main reasons for the acceleration of inflation are the rise in the price of imported goods due to the appreciation of the dollar over the past two months. Additionally, certain member states raising indirect taxes and increasing wages have also contributed to the acceleration of inflation.

Christophersen urged governments of the member states to implement a tight monetary policy, control wage growth, and reduce public expenditure and fiscal deficits. He warned that if inflation worsens, it will seriously hinder the current economic growth trend.

　　欧共体呼吁遏制通货膨胀
    新华社布鲁塞尔５月２５日电  欧洲共同体委员会今天就共同体通货膨胀率进一步上升发出警告。
    委员会负责经济和财政事务的副主席亨宁·克里斯托弗森在一项声明中呼吁共同体各成员国采取坚定的行动，以防通货膨胀暂时性加速导致未来通货膨胀加剧。
    据官方统计，在截至今年３月份为止的过去１２个月中，共同体的通货膨胀按年率计算由３．２％上升到５％。初步统计显示，今年４月份，共同体的通货膨胀年率已进一步上升到５．４％。
    共同体委员会认为，通货膨胀加速的主要原因是，在过去两个月中，由于美元汇率上升，共同体进口产品价格上扬。此外，某些成员国提高间接税和增加工资等因素也对通货膨胀加速起了一定的影响。
    克里斯托弗森敦促各成员国政府实行紧缩的货币政策，同时节制工资增长，压缩公共开支和财政赤字。他警告说，如果通货膨胀加剧，这将严重阻碍目前的经济增长进程。
