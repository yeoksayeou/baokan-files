Cadres Ride Bicycles to the Countryside to Listen to the People's Voices
Laizhou City Launches a Dialogue with 10,000 Households

How are the policies of the Party and the government being implemented in rural areas? What are the aspirations and demands of the peasant masses? To get a clear picture, Laizhou City in Shandong Province recently organized over 1,000 cadres from city and township offices to ride bicycles, carrying their luggage, to visit 100 villages and 10,000 households. They listened broadly to the voices of the peasant masses and worked diligently to help solve practical problems.

The leaders of Laizhou City believe that to understand the people's sentiments, one must first change the style of work of the cadres and truly get close to the peasants in thought and emotion. To this end, they clearly stipulated: when going to the countryside for investigations, one must not ride in small cars, stay in guesthouses, or accept banquets. Although the city's Party Secretary, Wang Xuegang, suffers from severe lumbar disc herniation, he, like other cadres, rode a bicycle. In more than 10 days, he braved wind and rain, covering over 200 kilometers, visiting 6 townships and 11 villages. In the fields, alleys, and on kangs (traditional heated beds), he visited over 100 households, talking and dialoguing with the peasants. When many peasants reported to him problems of malpractices in the supply of production materials and some Party and government departments using their power to extort and "pluck the feathers of passing geese," Wang Xuegang deeply felt that if we do not quickly improve the construction of clean government, we may become the opposite of the masses.

Based on the opinions of the peasants, this city first investigated the clean government situation of 10 units that have direct contact with thousands of households in the countryside, such as the supply and marketing cooperatives, industrial and commercial administration bureaus, tax bureaus, banks and credit cooperatives, grain management bureaus, agricultural power stations, and courts. Through questionnaires, they let the people make fair evaluations, and then used vertical and horizontal feedback methods to make the evaluation results public. At the same time, they promptly and seriously dealt with the problems found during the investigation.

　　干部骑车下乡　倾听群众呼声
    莱州市开展万户对话
    据新华社济南５月２８日电  （通讯员邓兆安）党和政府在农村中的各项方针政策落实得怎样？农民群众有些什么愿望和要求？为摸清这个底数，山东省莱州市最近组织１千多名市乡机关干部，骑着自行车，带着行李，深入到１００个村庄、１万户农民家中，广泛倾听农民群众的呼声，扎扎实实帮助解决实际问题。
    莱州市的领导认为，要体察民情，首先要转变干部作风，真正从思想感情上与农民贴近。为此，他们明确提出：下乡搞调查不准坐小汽车，不准住招待所，不准吃请。市委书记王学刚虽然有严重的腰椎间盘脱出病，同其他干部一样，骑着自行车，在１０多天的时间里，顶风冒雨行程２００多公里，跑了６个乡镇１１个村庄，在田间、小巷和炕头上，走访了１００多个农户，与农民谈心、对话。当不少农民向他反映生产资料供应中的不正之风问题，和一些党政部门利用手中的权力敲诈勒索、“雁过拔毛”的事，王学刚深有感触地说，如果再不尽快搞好廉政建设，我们就可能成为群众的对立面。
    根据农民的意见，这个市首先对与农村千家万户联系直接、打交道多的各乡镇供销社、工商所、税务所、银行和信用社、粮管所和农电站、法庭等１０个单位的廉政情况，通过调查问卷的形式，让群众公正评价，然后采取纵向和横向反馈的方法，将评价结果公诸于众，同时对调查中发现的问题及时予以严肃查处。
