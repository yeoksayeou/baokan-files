In Sichuan, the emergence of long-term trading contracts in three cities and one county has brought a glimmer of hope for the healthy development of the pig industry. People are looking forward to it—building a new production and operation order.

In 1988, Sichuan Province's pig outturn reached 56.93 million heads, an 11% increase over the previous year. This not only brought joy to people but also brought headaches.

Last January, Sichuan implemented an "open operation" policy for the pig industry across the province. Over the next 15 months, this industry experienced an unprecedented backlog and dumping wave.

Meat storage facilities were full to capacity. Yet, tens of thousands of producers continued to bring their pigs to the procurement points. Despite the commercial departments and individual merchants repeatedly lowering the procurement prices and even refusing to accept pigs, the situation remained unchanged. Some procurement points received as many pigs in a day as they would normally receive in three or four months. Many producers began to sell their pigs and dismantle their pens, and the pig industry showed signs of decline.

To reverse the situation, the competent authorities took various measures to protect the interests of producers while appealing through the media for assistance from relevant central departments and other provinces and cities. Various levels of government also made great efforts to explain to producers and ask for their understanding. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Railways urgently organized transportation to help export pork from Sichuan...

During this period, producers were resentful, operators were burdened with various insults and huge financial losses, and the government was burdened with high subsidies...

What caused all this?

On the surface, the direct cause was the nationwide grain reduction last year, including Sichuan. The reduction in grain led to a sharp increase in feed prices, significantly reducing the producers' income.

However, delving deeper, the turmoil exposed two long-standing issues.

Issue one: A lone army cannot advance deeply.

Sichuan has traditional, technological, and climatic advantages in developing the pig industry. However, it also has some fatal weaknesses, such as the relatively difficult "Sichuan Road" and the long-standing "human-pig competition for grain" conflict.

In terms of transportation, in the past, the commercial volume of various industrial and agricultural products in this province was not as large as it is today, and transportation was relatively relaxed. But now, with the development of various industries, the commercial volume is increasing, and everyone is competing for transportation. However, transportation can only meet half of the demand, meaning half of the goods cannot be transported out, thus causing conflicts.

In terms of feed, Sichuan's grain production can only meet its own needs. Suddenly increasing the production of so many pigs makes the feed source a problem. Last year, the nationwide grain reduction led to an even tighter feed supply.

Issue two: The traditional operation system is detached from the changing reality.

Traditionally, Sichuan's pig outturn is mainly concentrated in July and November, forming two peak seasons. Correspondingly, a set of operating and social service systems adapted to this has been established. However, reality has changed today. The commercial production of pigs has reached an unprecedented scale, and the commercial rate of pigs is continuously increasing. The sudden increase in commercial volume concentrated in the two peak seasons cannot be sustained by the existing operating system. Even if it could be sustained, consumers could not consume so much in a concentrated period.

The backlog that occurred in February this year is a reaction to this problem. Nationwide, there was a backlog at the same time. What is even more pressing is that the small peak season for pig sales is about to arrive.

Last summer, during the pig backlog and dumping wave in Sichuan, an event occurred that might be important for solving the problem.

This was the emergence of forward trading contracts.

At that time, to stop the large-scale dumping behavior of producers, the leaders of the governments of Leshan City, Chongqing City, Deyang City, and Hejiang County in Sichuan, along with the operators of the commercial food departments, thought: Are the producers not worried that the soaring feed prices will increase their production costs and affect their income? Fortunately, there are still hundreds of millions of kilograms of corn in the granaries, so they can be provided to them at a preferential price (lower than the market price). The condition is to borrow and return the grain; delay the pig outturn date. The commercial food departments then guarantee that the pig procurement price in the future will not be lower than the current market price (or the government's minimum protection price), and will float upwards with market price changes, not downward; provide services from disease prevention, feed to breeding technology, etc.

For this, the producers and operators formally signed a contract.

The effect of this measure was obvious. The large-scale dumping wave quickly subsided, and the producers began to repair their pens and add young pigs.

This approach attracted the attention of Sichuan's decision-makers and economic circles. Although the purpose of this forward contract is to stop the dumping behavior of producers and there are areas that need improvement, it gives Sichuan, which has been plagued by pig problems for a long time, an important enlightenment: If the boundaries between the off-peak and peak seasons are blurred, the sudden concentrated pressure is diverted, and balanced production is achieved, can it not meet the market's requirements and alleviate various contradictions in the peak season, reduce backlog and dumping losses?

Sichuan's pig forward trading contract is a futures contract in the futures market, but it has not yet seen the buying and selling of contracts, so it cannot be considered a futures transaction or futures market. However, it already has some advantages: First, both producers and operators can participate in price setting. In the past, it was more the operators who set the prices, and producers had little say. Now, only when both parties agree will a contract be signed and a transaction be made. Second, farmers can decide on the scale of production at their leisure according to the contract, without worrying about future price fluctuations, solving the contradiction between "small production and large market." Third, it can make the overall price of pigs more stable, avoiding various "competition wars," and avoiding unexpected losses for producers due to market changes. Fourth, the commercial food departments can order pigs from producers at any month of the year to meet the changes in market supply and demand.

Because the forward trading contract helps to solve the various contradictions in the pig industry, the commercial food departments in Sichuan and some producers with a scale of 10-300 pigs have expanded the number of such transactions, signing forward trading contracts for 1 million pigs for periods of three to four months.

In terms of development significance, the Sichuan pig industry, which has achieved continuous growth for 12 years, is about to overcome a historically significant winter. Starting from the forward pig trading contract, will the Sichuan pig industry establish a production and operation order suitable for modern commodity economy? Will it achieve long-term development? The reality will give the answer.

### 建立新的生产经营秩序

　　在四川，三市一县远期交易合同的出现，给生猪生产经营的健康发展带来了一线光明，人们期待着，通过它——   
    建立新的生产经营秩序
    新华社记者  王毅
    １９８８年，四川省的生猪出栏数达到５６９３万头，比上年增长１１％，这不光给人们带来喜悦，也带来了苦恼。
    去年１月，四川在全省范围内对生猪业采取“开放经营”政策。１５个月来，这个产业遇上了从没有过的积压和抛售风潮。
    各地肉库全部暴满。然而，成千上万的生产者仍抬着生猪不断涌向各个收购站。尽管商业部门和个体商人对收购价一压再压，甚至拒收，但无济于事。有的收购点一天涌来的肉猪就相当于正常情况下三四个月的交售量。一些生产者纷纷卖猪毁圈，养猪业出现“滑坡”征兆。
    为挽回颓局，主管部门一面采取保护生产者利益的各种措施，一面通过新闻媒介呼吁中央有关部委和其它省市伸出援助之手；各级政府还艰难地向生产者作出各种解释，请求他们对政府谅解。同时，商业部、铁道部紧急组织运力帮助猪肉出川……
    这期间，生产者情绪愤懑，经营者背负各种骂名和巨额资金积压的损失，政府也背着高额补贴金的包袱……
    究竟是什么造成这一切的呢？
    表面看来，直接起因是去年包括四川在内的全国性的粮食减产。减产引起饲料价格暴涨，生产者的收益大幅度下降。
    但是，再往深究，风波暴露了长期存在的两个问题。
    问题之一：孤军很难深入。
    四川发展生猪业有传统、技术、气候等方面得天独厚的有利条件。但是，它也有不少致命的弱点，如：相对而言的“蜀道难”和潜伏多年的“人猪争粮”矛盾。
    从运力上看，过去，这个省的各种工、农产品的商品量没有今天这样大，运力显得相对宽松。但如今各行各业发展后提供的商品越来越多，都在争夺运力，而运力只能满足一半的需要，也就是说还有一半货物运不出去，因而矛盾爆发。
    从饲料上看，四川生产的粮食只能自保，猛然增产这么多数量的生猪，饲料来源就成了问题。去年，全国粮食减产，导致本来已紧张的饲料更紧。
    问题之二：传统的经营系统与变化了的现实脱节。
    习惯上，四川生猪出栏时间主要集中在７月和１１月，因而在这段时间内形成了两个旺季。与之相对，也就出现了一套适应它的经营和社会服务体系。而今天，现实已发生变化。生猪的商品生产达到空前的规模，生猪商品率不断提高，突然增加的商品量集中于两个旺季出现，过去建立的那一套经营系统根本承受不了。即使承受了，消费者在集中的时间内也消费不了那么多。
    今年２月出现的积压，正是这一问题的反应。全国同时在这个时间出现了胀库。不让你喘口气的是，交售生猪的小旺季紧接着就要来到。
    去年夏末，四川生猪积压和抛售风潮中出现的一件事，可能对解决问题具有重要意义。
    这就是远期交易合同的出现。
    当时，为阻止生产者大规模的抛售行为，四川省乐山市、重庆市、德阳市、合江县政府领导和商业食品部门的经营者们想到：生产者不是担心飞涨的饲料会使他们养猪的成本上升，影响收入吗？正好粮仓中还有数亿公斤的玉米，就以优惠的价格（低于市场价）提供给他们。条件是，借粮还粮；推迟生猪的出栏日期。而商业食品部门则保证以后收购生猪时价格不低于现在的市场价（或政府规定的最低保护价）水平，并在今后市场价格发生变化时，随行上浮，不得下压；提供从防疫、饲料到饲养技术等方面的服务。
    为此，生产者和经营者双方正式签订了合同。
    这项措施的效果是明显的。大规模的抛售风潮很快平息，生产者又开始修圈盖舍，添增幼猪。
    这一作法引起了四川决策层和经济界人士的注意。虽然，这个远期合同的目的在于阻止生产者的抛售行为，并且有需要完善的地方，但给受生猪问题困扰已久的四川一个重要的启示：如果把淡旺季的界限模糊，分流骤然而集中的压力，做到均衡生产，不是既能适应市场的要求，又可以缓解旺季中的各种矛盾，减少积压和抛售损失吗！
    四川生猪的远期交易合同就是期货市场中的期货，只是还没有出现对合同的买卖，不能认为已形成期货交易或期货市场。但是，已具备了这样一些好处：一、生产者与经营者都可参与价格的制定。而过去更多的是经营者一方制定，生产者很少有发言权。现在只有双方认可，才会签订合同，进行交易。二、农民生产者根据合同，从容决定生产规模，不必为将来的价格涨落而担心，解决了“小生产与大市场”的矛盾。三、可使整个生猪的价格趋于平稳，避免各种“争夺大战”，避免生产者因市场行情变化而遭受意外损失。四、商业食品部门能够在全年的任何一个月里订购生产者提供的生猪，满足市场供需的变化。
    由于远期交易合同有助于解决生猪业中现存的各种矛盾，四川商业食品部门与一些生产规模在１０—３００头猪的生产者，扩大了这一形式的交易数量，签订了为期三四个月不等的１００万头生猪的远期交易合同。
    从发展的意义讲，曾取得连续１２年增长的四川生猪业，正在越过它历史上一个具有全新意义的冬天。从远期生猪交易合同出发，四川生猪业会不会建立起一套适应现代商品经济的生产、经营秩序呢？会不会获得长期的发展？现实将会作出回答。
