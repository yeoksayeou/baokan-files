Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 12th.

Yuan Mu, the spokesperson for the State Council, held a press conference this morning to brief domestic and foreign journalists on China's national economic development in the first four months of the year.

Yuan Mu said that since the beginning of this year, various regions and departments have continued to implement the policies of rectification and reform, and the economic situation is gradually improving.

According to Yuan Mu:

- Spring plowing work has been well-organized, and the growth of summer grain crops is promising. As long as there are no severe natural disasters and timely measures are taken to combat drought, floods, and pests, the total summer grain output is expected to exceed the historical high of 186.5 billion jin in 1986.

- The high speed of industrial production has slowed down, and there are no signs of economic recession or stagflation. Industrial production in the first four months grew by 11.3% compared to the same period last year, which is lower than the 16.9% growth rate of the same period last year.

- The financial situation has shown initial signs of easing. By April 30, the national net withdrawal of currency amounted to 6.5 billion yuan; the balance of urban and rural residents' savings deposits reached 421.1 billion yuan, an increase of 40.9 billion yuan, or 10.8%, from the beginning of the year, and an increase of 84.7 billion yuan, or 25.2%, compared to the same period last year.

- Progress has been made in utilizing foreign capital. In the first four months, the total amount of foreign capital utilized nationwide reached $4.529 billion, an increase of 44.2% compared to the same period last year.

- The upward trend in prices has eased. The price index in January was 5.3% higher than in December last year, 1.5% higher in February than in January, 0.9% higher in March than in February, and basically stable in April compared to March. Market commodity sales are relatively stable, and the phenomenon of panic buying of certain commodities in late February in some regions has basically subsided.

Yuan Mu pointed out that the current situation remains severe, mainly manifested in the following areas: the contradiction between total social demand and total supply is still very prominent, the scale of fixed asset investment has not been sufficiently compressed, consumption demand is still growing too fast, wages and other personal cash expenditures have increased by 27.7% compared to the same period last year, higher than the 21% growth rate of the same period last year; although the growth rate of industrial production has slowed down, structural contradictions have not been alleviated; economic benefits are not ideal, the comparable product cost of state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget has increased by 15.8%, and the profit and tax realized per 100 yuan of sales revenue has decreased by 11% compared to the same period last year; the price increase rate is still high compared to the same period last year, and issues such as disorderly circulation have not been fundamentally resolved.

　　袁木向中外记者介绍头四个月经济发展情况    
    经济形势趋向好转    
    工业速度回落金融形势缓和利用外资加快    
    供需矛盾突出压缩投资不够经济效益不好
    据新华社北京５月１２日电　国务院发言人袁木今天上午召开记者招待会，向中外记者通报今年１—４月我国国民经济的发展情况。
    袁木说，今年以来，各地区、各部门继续贯彻执行治理整顿和深化改革的方针，经济形势正逐步向好的方向转变。
    据袁木介绍：
    ——今年春耕工作抓得较紧，夏季粮食作物长势较好。只要不出现严重的自然灾害，并抓紧做好抗旱、防汛和防治病虫害等后期管理工作，夏粮总产量可望突破１９８６年１８６５亿斤的历史最高纪录。
    ——过高的工业生产速度回落，同时也还没有出现生产衰退、经济滞胀的现象。１—４月工业生产比去年同期增长１１．３％，低于去年同期增长１６．９％的幅度。
    ——金融形势出现了初步缓和的迹象。到４月３０日，全国净回笼货币６５亿元；城乡居民储蓄存款余额达到４２１１亿元，比今年初增加４０９亿元，增长１０．８％，比去年同期增加８４７亿元、增长２５．２％。
    ——在利用外资方面取得新的进展。１—４月全国利用外资协议总额达到４５．２９亿美元，比去年同期增长４４．２％。
    ——物价涨势减弱。今年１月物价指数比去年１２月上涨５．３％，２月比１月上涨１．５％，３月比２月上涨０．９％，４月与３月基本持平。市场商品销售较为平稳，２月下旬少数地区出现的少数商品抢购现象基本平息。
    袁木指出，当前的形势仍相当严峻，主要表现在：社会总需求与总供给的矛盾仍然十分突出，固定资产投资规模的压缩还很不够，消费需求仍增长过快，工资和个人其他现金支出比去年同期增长２７．７％，高于去年同期增长２１％的幅度；工业生产增长速度虽然下降，但结构性矛盾仍未缓解；经济效益不理想，预算内国营工业企业可比产品成本上升１５．８％，每百元销售收入实现利税比去年同期下降１１％；物价上涨幅度与去年同期相比仍居高不下，流通秩序混乱等问题还没有得到根本缓解。
