There have been numerous agricultural and pastoral product wars, numbering over 20: the silk cocoon war, the wool war, the hemp war, the shrimp war, and so on. Now, in addition to agricultural products, there is also an interest rate war. The intensity of the battle and the fervor of the conflict are in no way inferior to other wars, and there is even a trend of surpassing them.

This incident originated from a certain city's "Patriotic Savings Month" in March of this year. The Industrial and Commercial Bank, the Agricultural Bank, and the Construction Bank all competed to attract savings deposits with enticing interest rates. The annual interest rates rose in succession: 15%, 17%, 22%, 23%, 25%. By mid-month, the rates soared even higher, reaching as high as 60%, leaving people astonished and speechless. For a time, depositors were driven back and forth by the interest rate lever, withdrawing and depositing, depositing and withdrawing. The savings offices were bustling with activity, and everyone was extremely busy. Finally, the municipal government and the People's Bank had to intervene and announce several measures to bring the war to a halt.

According to experts' calculations, the city's manipulation of interest rates caused the state a direct economic loss of 10 million yuan.

If the agricultural and pastoral product wars involve broad areas and complex factors such as production and circulation, central versus local, regional versus regional, and departmental versus departmental interests, as well as policy and measure coordination issues during reform, then the causes of the interest rate war are much simpler. It is that the various specialized banks, in their pursuit of increased savings deposits, disregarded financial order and discipline, as well as economic benefits, and engaged in a fierce "internal war" at all costs. The large-scale transfer of deposits does not significantly increase the amount of social savings, but it does cause considerable harm. This is something that bankers should reflect on.

Prices cannot be arbitrarily inflated, and neither can interest rates. The occurrence of the interest rate war during the rectification and control period clearly indicates the urgency and difficulty of the rectification tasks.

　　咋舌之余
    杨泓
    有人算过，农牧产品大战大概有不下２０多个：蚕茧大战、羊毛大战、苎麻大战、对虾大战……如今农产品之外又添了利率大战。战鼓之紧，战火之旺，比起其他大战毫不逊色，而且大有后来居上之势。
    事出于某市的今年３月“爱国储蓄月”。工商银行、农业银行、建设银行竞相以诱人的利率来吸收储蓄存款，年利率轮番看涨：１５％，１７％，２２％，２３％，２５％。到了中旬，更是扶摇直上，竟有高达６０％者，令人瞠目咋舌。一时间，存户被利率这根杠杆赶来赶去，提款、存款，存款、提款，储蓄所里人头攒动，忙得不可开交。最后不得不由市政府、人民银行等出面制止，宣布几条措施，一场大战才告平息。
    据专家测算，该市哄抬利率给国家造成的直接经济损失可达１０００万元。
    如果说，农牧产品这大战、那大战涉面广，因素复杂，如生产与流通，中央与地方，地区与地区，部门与部门的利害关系，改革中政策、措施之配套问题等等，那么，利率大战的原因就简单得多，那就是各专业银行之间只顾追求储蓄存款增加，不顾金融秩序和纪律及经济效益，不惜血本而大打“内战”。存款大搬家，并不能增加多少社会储蓄量，造成的祸害却不少。这，很值得银行界人士反思。
    物价不能任意哄抬，利率也不能任意哄抬。在整顿、治理之际发生利率大战的怪事，正好说明整治任务的紧迫性和艰巨性。
