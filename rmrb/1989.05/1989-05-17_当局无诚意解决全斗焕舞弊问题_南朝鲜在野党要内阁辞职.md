The authorities lack sincerity in addressing the corruption issues from Chun Doo-hwan's presidency, and South Korean opposition parties demand the resignation of the cabinet.

Pyeongyang, May 17 (Xinhua) — Seoul: South Korean opposition parties, noting that the current administration led by President Roh Tae-woo has shown no sincerity in resolving the corruption issues from the Fifth Republic era under Chun Doo-hwan, have called for the resignation of the entire cabinet led by Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jun.

Kim Young-sam, the chairman of the opposition Republican Party, stated that his party had previously opposed the demand for cabinet resignation from other opposition parties. However, given the current administration's lack of sincerity in addressing the corruption issues of the Fifth Republic, his party will now join forces with other opposition parties to demand the resignation of the entire cabinet.

The Democratic Party, led by Kim Dae-jung, also expressed its demand for the current administration to swiftly resolve the corruption issues of the Fifth Republic and for Chun Doo-hwan and Choi Gyu-ha to testify. During a recent meeting, they also discussed the demand for the resignation of the entire cabinet.

Kim Young-sam's Democratic Party stated that if the ruling administration does not address the corruption issues of the Fifth Republic, his party will not participate in the scheduled meeting of the four-party leadership next week.

This demand for cabinet resignation was first proposed by Kim Dae-jung on May 6. The reason given was that the recent political instability in South Korea has disrupted the investigation into the corruption cases of the Fifth Republic. Kim Dae-jung's call has received support from other opposition parties.

　　当局无诚意解决全斗焕舞弊问题    
    南朝鲜在野党要内阁辞职
    新华社平壤５月１７日电  汉城消息：南朝鲜在野党鉴于卢泰愚现内阁对解决前总统全斗焕执政时期的舞弊问题没有诚意，要求以国务总理姜英勋为首的现内阁总辞职。
    在野的共和党总裁金镌必说，他的党原来反对别的在野党要求内阁总辞职的议案，但现在执政当局对解决第五共和国舞弊问题等没有诚意，他的党将与别的在野党采取共同行动，要求现内阁总辞职。
    金大中领导的平民党也表示，要求当局尽快解决第五共和国舞弊问题、要求全斗焕、崔圭夏作证问题，并在日前召开的常务会议上也讨论了要求现内阁总辞职的问题。
    金泳三的民主党表示，如果执政当局不解决第五共和国的舞弊问题，他的党将不参加原订于下星期举行的朝野４党领导干部会议。
    在野党这次要求内阁总辞职是金大中于５月６日首先提出来的。理由是南朝鲜政局近来动荡不稳，致使清算第五共和国舞弊案的工作中断。金大中的这一号召得到了其它在野党的响应。
