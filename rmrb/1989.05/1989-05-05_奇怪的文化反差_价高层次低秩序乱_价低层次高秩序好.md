A strange cultural contrast has emerged in Shanghai's dance halls and music cafes: higher prices do not necessarily attract individuals with higher cultural standards, while lower prices seem to draw those with better manners. This phenomenon is worth pondering.

Shanghai currently has 232 dance halls and 25 music cafes, with ticket prices varying significantly. The highest ticket price for a dance hall is 35 yuan per person, while the lowest is 0.6 yuan. Music cafes range from 1.5 yuan to 12 yuan.

Interestingly, the price of tickets does not correlate with the cultural level of the patrons. Those who frequent high-end dance halls and music cafes, costing over 10 yuan, are mostly individual business owners with relatively lower cultural standards. Conversely, those who visit lower-end venues tend to be intellectuals.

In a dance hall in Luwan District, where the ticket price is 2 yuan, the majority of the dancers are middle-aged and elderly intellectuals, including teachers, scientists, medical professionals, and more. Their dance moves are standard, elegant, and beautiful. The dance floor is clean, with no loud noises, and smokers go to the designated smoking area outside. However, in some dance halls charging around 30 yuan per ticket, the order is not as good, and the quality of some performers is questionable. They often use strange tunes to cater to certain audiences, leading to whistles and jeers from the crowd. In March of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Affairs Administration conducted a basic music theory test for over 1,600 singers, and only 16.5% passed.

### 奇怪的文化反差  价高层次低秩序乱  价低层次高秩序好

　　奇怪的文化反差    
    价高层次低秩序乱    
    价低层次高秩序好
    新华社上海电  （记者赵兰英）价高迎来的并不是文化素质高的人，而光顾价低的倒是修养较高者，这是时下出现在上海舞厅和音乐茶座的一种奇怪的反差现象。
    上海现有舞厅２３２家，音乐茶座２５家，各家的票价很悬殊；舞厅高的每位３５元，低的６角。音乐茶座是１．５元至１２元不等。
    值得深思的是，票价高低与顾客文化层次并不成正比。出入１０元以上的中高档舞厅、音乐茶座的，绝大多数是个体户，他们的文化素质较差。而光顾低档舞厅、音乐茶座的倒是知识分子居多。
    记者在票价２元的卢湾区科技馆舞厅里看到，来这里翩翩起舞的绝大多数是中老年知识界人士，其中有教师、科技人员、医护工作者等等。他们的舞姿标准、规范、优美。舞池整洁，没有嘈杂声，抽烟的则到门外的吸烟室。而在一些收费３０元左右的舞厅，场内秩序并不好，一些歌手的素质也不那么好，常以怪腔怪调迎合某些听众，致使场内嘘喊声四起。今年３月，上海市社会文化管理处对１６００余名歌手进行了基本乐理考核，结果只有１６．５％的人及格。
