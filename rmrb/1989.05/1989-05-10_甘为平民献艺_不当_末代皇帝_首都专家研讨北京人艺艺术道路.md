Recently, the Drama Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Arts and the Beijing People's Art Theatre jointly held a "Theoretical Symposium on the Artistic Path of Beijing People's Art Theatre." More than 40 experts, scholars, artists, and graduate students from Beijing attended the meeting. The conference started with a discussion on the achievements and potential issues of the Beijing People's Art Theatre, leading to debates on artistic spirit, style, national characteristics, cultural affiliation, and crisis awareness.

At the beginning of the meeting, some scholars pointed out that, contrary to the trend of aristocratization in the arts in recent years, the Beijing People's Art Theatre has a distinct spirit of serving the common people. This is the fundamental reason why the Beijing People's Art Theatre has a wide audience. Theatre is not just for a few high-level intellectuals; it should first and foremost be a popular art for the broad masses of the people. The Beijing People's Art Theatre is good at adjusting itself according to the social consciousness and aesthetic tastes of the broad audience. The popular spirit of the Beijing People's Art Theatre is specifically reflected in the vulgarization of the thematic content, the colloquialization of the artistic vocabulary, and the entertainment effect of aesthetics. However, the Beijing People's Art Theatre's creations differ from vulgar culture. Artists have created a refined popular drama with a serious attitude, neither pandering to the vulgar nor to the elite, achieving a state of both elegance and popular appeal.

The national character and the gentle, refined Eastern classical style of the Beijing People's Art Theatre aroused strong interest among some attendees. After reviewing the 40-year growth process of the Beijing People's Art Theatre, they pointed out that in the early 1950s, the Beijing People's Art Theatre started based on the Stanislavski system. However, due to the Beijing People's Art Theatre's emphasis on practical art and attention to specific Chinese conditions, it has now broken through the Stanislavski system and established a distinctive Chinese dramatic school. In theory, it proposed the "mental image" theory of performing arts, and in creation, it emphasizes the beauty of the artistic conception and folk customs. Some scholars further pointed out that the Beijing People's Art Theatre is a cultural theatre, embodying the grand, profound, and solemn cultural character of the Central Plains, which shakes the heart. However, it also presents the deep-layered spirit of agricultural civilization. How to transform from agricultural culture to urban culture is a serious task facing the Beijing People's Art Theatre and the national art community.

Some attendees believe that the main achievement of the Beijing People's Art Theatre lies not in the exploration of ideological themes (in this aspect, it is still some distance from the level reached by the intellectual and literary communities) but in the exquisite performing arts. They advocate individualized performing methods and have cultivated a group of the most outstanding actors on the Chinese drama stage. Some artists strongly appealed, "Do not erase the creative individuality of actors, do not treat actors like putty to mold, do not trample on actors, and do not desecrate the stage." Placing performing arts in a core position is a precious tradition of our national drama.

From this, the attendees frankly expressed their concerns about the future of the Beijing People's Art Theatre. The past glory of the Beijing People's Art Theatre may lead to reminiscence and satisfaction, causing self-enclosure and a lack of crisis awareness and urgency. The Beijing People's Art Theatre not only needs to be able to perform old Beijing but also to perform new Beijing, representing new social life and social consciousness. In this regard, the Beijing People's Art Theatre has fallen behind some drama troupes. The Beijing People's Art Theatre team also faces the task of changing personnel. The new generation of actors not only needs to fully absorb the artistic nutrients accumulated by the older generation of artists but also needs to open up new paths to represent contemporary life. In both aspects, the Beijing People's Art Theatre has not yet shown satisfactory performance. Facing the crisis, the artists of the Beijing People's Art Theatre expressed that they will not be the "last emperor" and will definitely make the Beijing People's Art Theatre play a further role in the construction of Chinese drama art.

At the same time, some scholars pointed out that the path of the Beijing People's Art Theatre is not the only model for developing drama. Because excellent troupes like the Beijing People's Art Theatre still rely on state subsidies. Those troupes that need to make a living by performing cannot sustain themselves by copying the Beijing People's Art Theatre model. However, the successful artistic experience of the Beijing People's Art Theatre is not without reference significance for them.

　　甘为平民献艺　不当“末代皇帝”    
    首都专家研讨北京人艺艺术道路
    本报讯  不久前，中国艺术研究院话剧研究所和北京人民艺术剧院联合召开了“北京人艺艺术道路理论研讨会”，在京的专家、学者、艺术家、研究生４０多人出席了会议。会议从人艺的成就和隐患入手，引发了关于艺术精神、风格、民族性、文化归属以及危机意识等问题的讨论。
    会议一开始，一些学者就指出，与近年来文艺界某种贵族化倾向相反，北京人艺具有鲜明的平民精神，这是人艺之所以拥有广大观众的根本原因。话剧，不是只为少数高层知识分子服务的，她首先应该是面向广大人民群众的平民艺术。人艺善于根据广大观众的社会意识和审美趣味作自我调整。人艺的平民精神具体表现在题材内容的市俗化、艺术语汇的通俗化和审美效应的娱乐性上。但人艺的创作又区别于那些庸俗文化，艺术家们以严肃的态度创造了一种精致的通俗戏剧，既不媚俗，也不媚雅，达到了雅俗共赏的境界。
    人艺的民族性格和温淳敦厚的东方古典风格引起了一些与会学者强烈的兴趣。他们在回顾人艺４０年成长历程后指出，５０年代初人艺是在斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基体系基础上起步的，但是由于人艺崇尚以实求艺的精神，注重中国具体国情，因而到目前，已经突破了斯坦尼体系，建立起富有中国气派的戏剧学派。它在理论上提出了表演艺术“心象”说，在创作上注重意境美、民俗美。有的学者进一步指出，北京人艺是文化型剧院，她体现了豪迈、浑厚、凝重的中原文化品格，震撼人心。然而她又呈现了深层的农业文明精神，如何从农业文化向城市文化转化正是北京人艺和全国艺术界同行面临的严峻课题。
    一些与会者认为北京人艺的艺术成就主要不在于思想主题的开掘（在这方面离开思想界、文学界达到的高度尚有距离），而在于精湛的表演艺术。倡导个性化的表演方法，培养了一大批中国话剧舞台上最优秀的演员。有的艺术家强烈呼吁，不要抹煞演员的创作个性、不要把演员当橡皮泥捏，不要蹂躏演员，不要亵渎舞台。把表演艺术放在核心的位置上，正是我们民族戏剧的宝贵传统。
    由此，到会者们直陈了他们对人艺前景的忧虑，人艺过去的辉煌容易导致回味和满足，造成自我封闭，缺乏危机感和紧迫感。北京人艺不仅要能演老北京，更要能演新北京，表现新的社会生活和社会意识。在这方面，人艺已落后于某些戏剧团体。人艺的队伍还面临着换人换血的任务，新一代的演员不仅要充分汲取老一辈艺术家积累起来的艺术养分，还需要开拓新的路子去表现当代生活，而在这两方面人艺都尚未有令人满意的表现。面对危机，人艺的艺术家表示，不当“末代皇帝”，一定要使人艺在中国话剧艺术的建设中进一步发挥作用。
    同时，也有学者指出，人艺的道路并不是发展戏剧的唯一模式。因为像人艺这样的优秀剧团依然要依靠国家的补贴。那些要靠演戏谋生的剧团照搬人艺模式是难以为继的。但是人艺艺术上的成功经验对他们并不失借鉴意义。
