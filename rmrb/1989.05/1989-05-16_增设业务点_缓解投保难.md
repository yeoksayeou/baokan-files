Since 1979, when Beijing resumed insurance services, some progress has been made. However, the current situation still falls short of the actual insurance needs of the city. Over the past decade, only 1/8 of the total population in the city has taken out personal insurance, only 2/5 of motor vehicles have insurance coverage, and only 50% of households have property insurance. Less than 1/5 of central enterprises in Beijing have insurance coverage.

The slow development of the insurance industry in Beijing is due not only to a lack of understanding among the public but also to the scarcity of specialized institutions for handling insurance business. To date, the insurance sub-companies in the Dongcheng, Xicheng, Xuanwu, and Chongwen districts still do not have their own office space, and the municipal insurance company's office space is rented. With the deepening of the reform, especially in recent years, the expansion of insurance coverage to include old-age insurance for township enterprise employees, reserve insurance for only-child families, old-age insurance for parents of only-child families in rural areas, child safety insurance, and student safety insurance, as well as agricultural and foreign-related insurance, has further broadened the scope of insurance coverage. In light of this situation, relevant officials suggest that the municipal government's relevant departments should coordinate and plan to quickly establish a batch of service points directly serving the insurance business to alleviate the difficulties users face in obtaining insurance coverage.

　　增设业务点　缓解投保难
    北京市自１９７９年恢复保险业务以来，虽取得了一些成绩，但仍与北京需投保的实际情况相差甚远。１０年来，已办理的人身保险只占全市总人口的１／８，机动车辆参加保险的只有２／５，家庭财产保险仅占５０％。中央在京企业参加保险的还不到１／５。
    北京保险业发展不快，除人们对它缺乏必要认识外，办理保险业务的专门机构少也是个重要原因。到目前为止，东城、西城、宣武、崇文四城区的保险分公司至今尚无办公用房，市保险公司的办公用房也是租来的。随着改革的不断深化，特别是近年来增辟的乡镇企业人员养老保险金，独生子女备用保险金，农村独生子女的父母养老保险金，幼儿平安保险和中小学生平安保险，以及农业保险和涉外保险等，进一步拓宽了保险覆盖面。面对这种状况，有关人士建议市政府有关部门统筹规划，尽快落实一批直接服务于保险业务的网点，缓解用户投保难。
