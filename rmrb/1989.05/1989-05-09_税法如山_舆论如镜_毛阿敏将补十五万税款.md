The law is like a mountain, public opinion is like a mirror. Singer Mao Aimin, who once moved television viewers with her song "Where do you come from, my friend," has now become a news figure due to tax evasion. On the morning of May 6, Mao Aimin reported to the Nanjing tax authorities her total income of over 270,000 yuan from external performances since 1987. Based on this, she should pay back over 150,000 yuan in evaded taxes.

Starting on March 15, the Nanjing tax authorities dispatched two investigation teams to Urumqi, Hangzhou, Harbin, Mudanjiang, Shenzhen, Haikou, and 11 other cities to investigate Mao Aimin's tax evasion during her "gig" performances. In early April, news outlets exposed the fact of Mao Aimin's tax evasion. For this reason, the Nanjing Military Region and the Frontline Song and Dance Troupe leadership sent personnel to bring Mao Aimin back to Nanjing from Beijing on April 21, urging her to report to the tax authorities for tax payment. Mao Aimin went to the tax authorities four times to truthfully report her income from "gig" performances since 1987, ultimately signing and acknowledging that she should pay back over 150,000 yuan in evaded taxes. The relevant tax authorities in Nanjing believe that Mao Aimin's reported tax payment amount exceeded the information they had investigated and obtained, and that Mao Aimin's attitude towards tax payment is positive.

It is understood that the evaded taxes Mao Aimin should pay back will be paid in full by the 20th of this month. Mao Aimin said in an interview with reporters today: "In the future, I will definitely pay taxes on time. If something comes up and I can't come, I will also entrust someone else to pay the taxes."

　　税法如山　舆论如镜    
    毛阿敏将补十五万税款
    本报南京五月九日电  新华社记者揭衍珍、本报记者孙健报道：曾以一曲“你从哪里来，我的朋友”打动电视观众，而今因漏税成为新闻人物的歌星毛阿敏，于五月六日上午向南京市税务部门申报了一九八七年以来她外出演出的总收入二十七万多元，按此计算应补交偷漏税款十五万余元。
    今年三月十五日开始，南京市税务部门派出南北两个调查组，分赴乌鲁木齐、杭州、哈尔滨、牡丹江、深圳、海口等十六个城市，调查毛阿敏“走穴”偷漏税情况。四月初，新闻单位又披露了毛阿敏偷漏税的事实。为此，南京军区和前线歌舞团领导派员于四月二十一日把毛阿敏从北京接回南京，督促毛阿敏向税务机关申报纳税。毛阿敏曾四次到税务机关如实申报了自己自一九八七年以来“走穴”演出的收入情况，最终签字认可补交偷漏税款为十五万余元，南京市有关税务部门认为，毛阿敏申报纳税数额超过了他们调查掌握的情况，毛阿敏对纳税的态度是积极的。
    据了解，毛阿敏应补交的偷漏税款将于本月二十日前交齐入库。毛阿敏今天接受记者采访时说：“今后一定按时交纳税款。如果有事来不了，我也会委托他人把税交上。”
