The city of Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province has initiated the "Mutual Assurance Between Soldiers and Civilians" activity to strengthen military-civilian and military-political relations. Recently, it was awarded the title of "Double Support City" by the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government and the Provincial Military Region.

Xuzhou, with its 11 counties and districts, has 60,000 households of beneficiaries. The entire city mobilized 82,000 militia members and young people to sign "Mutual Assurance" agreements with 28,000 Xuzhou natives serving in the military. Additionally, 284 counties, districts, and sub-district offices signed "Mutual Responsibility" agreements with 896 military units at the regiment, battalion, and company levels. Currently, the entire city has established over 30,000 organizations in urban and rural areas to serve the military and their families, with 700,000 officials and civilians directly participating in supporting the military and caring for military families. The principle is to help any family in need and to address any concerns promptly.

To improve the housing conditions of military families, since 1985, various counties and suburban areas have prioritized providing land for 6,000 military families, subsidizing 290,000 yuan for house construction, and voluntarily building over 11,000 rooms for impoverished military families. The city has also provided free subscriptions to nearly 10,000 science and technology publications for rural military families, prioritizing the placement of over 23,000 impoverished military families in township enterprises and various economic entities, enabling nearly 5,000 military families to escape poverty.

The municipal party committee and government have successively assigned 820 teachers to form a cultural remedial lecture team, offering remedial classes for military officers; they have consecutively held undergraduate classes for the military for four years, with 240 military officers receiving undergraduate diplomas; they have organized over 40 technical training and guidance classes for the military, with 28,000 soldiers receiving dual-use talent certificates.

The military supports the people, and the people support the military. The troops stationed in Xuzhou consider Xuzhou their second hometown, having supported nearly 70 key construction projects and public welfare projects in the local area.

    本报南京５月２６日电  记者龚永泉报道：江苏省徐州市开展“兵民双放心”活动，密切军民军政关系，前不久被江苏省人民政府和省军区授予“双拥城”称号。
    徐州所属１１个县区的优抚对象达６万户。全市发动８．２万名民兵、青年同２．８万多名徐州籍战士签定了“双放心”协议书；２８４个县区、办事处与部队８９６个团、营、连签订了军地“双负责”协议书。现在，全市城乡建起了３万多个为军队和军属服务的活动组织，７０多万干部群众直接参与拥军优属，做到哪家有难帮哪家，何时有忧何时排。为改善军属的住房条件，１９８５年以来，各县和郊区为６０００多户军属优先解决了宅基地，补助建房费２９万元，为贫困军属义务修建房屋１．１万多间。全市免费为农村军属订阅近万份科技报刊，优先安排２．３万多贫困军属参加乡村企业和各种经济实体，使近５０００户军属脱贫。
    市委、市政府先后抽调８２０多名教师组成文化补习讲师团，为部队干部举办文化补习班；连续４年为部队开办大专班，使２４０名军队干部领取了大专文凭；为部队举办４０多种技术培训班、辅导班，使２．８万多战士领取了军地两用人才合格证。
    民拥军，军爱民。驻徐部队把徐州当作自己的第二故乡，先后支援当地重点工程建设及公益事业工程近７０项。
