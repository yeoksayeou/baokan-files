    Anecdotes of Famous People Quitting Smoking
    The Qianlong Emperor quit smoking: The Qianlong Emperor enjoyed smoking very much. Later, he developed a cough and sought treatment from the imperial physician. The physician said, "Your Majesty's cough is due to smoking damaging your lungs. To cure the cough, you must first quit smoking." The Qianlong Emperor heeded the physician's advice and quit smoking, and his cough was cured.

    Marx quit smoking: Marx once had a severe smoking habit, often working while smoking. He once said, "The royalties from 'Das Kapital' are not enough to pay for the cigars needed during writing." Smoking caused him to develop bronchitis, so the doctor forbade him from smoking. Thus, he decided to quit smoking.

    Lenin quit smoking: Lenin started smoking at the age of seventeen. His mother, being a doctor's daughter, naturally knew the harm of smoking. She had advised her son to quit smoking several times. Once, she told him, "After your father passed away, the pension I receive is very little. If you don't smoke, the family's finances will be better." Hearing his mother's words, Lenin said, "Forgive me, Mother, I never thought of that. Alright, starting today, I will quit smoking." He then took out the half-pack of cigarettes from his pocket and placed it on the table, asking his mother to burn it. From then on, he never smoked again.

    Li Dazhao quit smoking: Li Dazhao started smoking heavily in his twenties due to working day and night. Later, he realized that smoking was harmful to his health and decided to quit.

    Marshal Chen Yi quit smoking: Marshal Chen was a heavy smoker. In 1954, when he had an attack of bronchitis, the doctor seriously advised him not to smoke. He immediately agreed to quit smoking and even persuaded his driver to quit as well. As a result, both of them successfully quit smoking.

    Zhao Ziyang quit smoking: In the past, he had a heavy smoking habit, but he quit smoking immediately when he decided to. Once, during an overseas visit, he told his accompanying personnel, "Many people relapse when quitting smoking, but I succeeded in one go." During the most critical period after quitting smoking, whenever he felt the urge to smoke, he would just smell a cigarette under his nose. According to his recollection, on the third day after quitting smoking, someone bought him a box of famous brand cigarettes. He hesitated, thinking of finishing the box before quitting, but ultimately, he overcame his desire with determination and gave the box of cigarettes to someone else.

    Reagan quit smoking: In the past, Reagan also smoked a pipe. Starting in 1985, Reagan decided to quit smoking. Last year, he signed a bill requiring cigarette packs to carry more warnings about the dangers of smoking. The United States is striving to create a "smoke-free" society by the year 2000.

    马克思戒烟：马克思一度烟瘾很大，常常一边工作一边吸烟，他曾说过，《资本论》的稿费不够偿付写作时需要的雪茄烟钱。吸烟使他得了气管炎，因此医生禁止他吸烟。这样，他就下决心把烟戒了。
    列宁戒烟：列宁在十七岁时就开始吸烟了，他的母亲是医生的女儿，当然懂得吸烟有害。她曾几次劝儿子戒烟。有一次母亲对他说：“你父亲去世后，我领到的养老金很少，你若不抽烟的话，家庭经济要好些。”听了母亲的话，列宁说：“请原谅，妈妈，这个我从没想过，好吧，从今天起我就戒烟。”说着，从衣袋里掏出吸剩的半包烟放在桌上，请妈妈将它烧毁。自此以后，他再也没有抽过一口烟。

    赵紫阳戒烟：过去他烟瘾不小，但说戒就戒了。一次出国访问时，他曾对陪同人员说：“许多人戒烟都有反复，但我是一举成功的。”在停止吸烟后那一段最关键的时间里，每当烟瘾袭来，他便拿支香烟在鼻子下嗅一嗅，如此而已。据他回忆：在他戒烟后的第三天，有人帮他买来一条名牌香烟，他有点犹豫，想抽完这条烟再戒，但最终还是凭着毅力战胜了欲望，一咬牙将那条香烟送给了别人。
