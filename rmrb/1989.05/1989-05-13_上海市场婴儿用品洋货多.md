A young father told the reporter, “My son, except for water, air, and fruit, everything he eats, uses, and wears is imported.” He spoke with pride.

Imported baby products are rapidly entering thousands of households in Shanghai. Many young parents take pride in their children using as many imported goods as possible.

Currently, the Shanghai market is flooded with imported baby products, covering everything from food to clothing, toys, and more. Prices range from nearly 100 yuan for a set of infant clothing to 30 foreign exchange coupons (20 coupons) for a pack of disposable diapers. From a 200 yuan set of baby shampoo, bath products, and skincare items to a bottle of talcum powder costing over ten yuan, these imported goods cover everything from head to toe. There are nearly 20 different brands of formula from France, the United States, Switzerland, Hong Kong, and other places alone.

It is understood that almost all infants and young children have used imported goods to some extent. These foreign products are often priced ten times higher than domestic ones. For example, a can of formula costs around 20 yuan and only lasts for 12 feedings. Most young parents, with monthly salaries of over 100 yuan, reluctantly spend the money. Some do so because they cannot find or have difficulty finding similar domestic products; others do not trust domestic products. However, many parents use imported goods to show off and flaunt their wealth.

　　上海市场婴儿用品洋货多
    有一位年轻爸爸告诉记者：“我儿子除了水、空气和水果，吃的用的穿的都是进口的。”言谈之际，颇为得意。
    婴儿用品进口货正以极其迅猛的势头向上海成千上万的家庭推进，许多年轻的爸爸妈妈都以自己的孩子能多用上进口货为荣。
    时下上海市场上进口的婴儿用品多得不可胜数，吃穿用玩都有，从近百元一套的小时装，到３０多元外汇券２０张的一次性尿布，从两百元一套的婴儿洗发水、洗澡用品、护肤品到十多元一瓶的爽身粉，几乎从里到外、从头到脚无不包容。仅奶粉就有法国、美国、瑞士、香港等地出产的近２０种。
    据了解，现在的婴幼儿或多或少大多都用过进口货。这些洋货价格往往高于国产货十倍以上，如一罐奶粉２０元左右，仅够吃１２次。大多数每月工资１００多元的年轻父母忍痛解囊，有的是因为没有或很难找同类的国产货；有的则是对国产货信不过，但不少父母却以孩子用洋货出风头摆阔气。
