The first national grassland science academic conference, jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, was recently held in Beijing. Over 50 experts urged that China's grasslands are severely degraded, with low productivity and minimal investment, and this issue should be given high priority.

China's grassland area is 600 million mu (approximately 40 million hectares), accounting for 40% of the country's total land area. This is one of the important natural resources. However, statistics show that the area of degraded grasslands nationwide has reached 130 million mu, about one-third of the utilizable grassland area. Currently, the degraded area is expanding at a rate of 10 million mu per year. Some grasslands have completely turned into deserts, while others have become entirely saline. Grassland degradation has led to the proliferation of rodent and insect pests, with rodent-infested grassland areas reaching 130 million mu. Grassland degradation has resulted in a decrease in livestock, directly affecting the development of the pastoral economy and posing a threat to the ecological environment.

Why has such severe degradation occurred? Experts believe that while there are factors such as climate, the main reason is the emphasis on utilization over construction. Over the past 40 years, the total national investment in grassland construction has been only 460 million yuan, averaging just 3 fen (0.03 yuan) per mu of grassland per year. Therefore, experts call on all levels of government to appropriately increase investment in grasslands, so that the vast grassland resources can be rationally developed and utilized.

　　专家在全国草地科学会议上呼吁    
    草地严重退化应高度重视
    本报北京５月１９日讯  记者何黄彪报道：由中国科学院与中国农科院共同组织的首次全国草地科学学术讨论会，日前在这里召开。５０多位专家呼吁：我国草地正在大面积退化，产出效益很低，投资很小，应引起高度重视。
    我国草地面积达６０亿亩，占国土总面积的４０％，这是自然资源中的重要资源之一。但据统计，现在，全国退化草场面积已达１３亿亩，约占可利用草场面积的１／３，目前还以每年１０００万亩的速度扩大。少数草场全部沙化，有的则全部碱化。草地退化又引起鼠虫害猖獗，草原鼠害面积达１．３亿亩。草地退化导致牲畜的下降，直接影响我国牧区经济的发展，也危及生态环境。
    为什么会造成如此严重的退化？专家们认为有气候等原因，但主要原因是重利用轻建设。４０年来，国家对草原建设总投资仅４６亿元，平均每年每亩草地仅３分钱。因此，专家们呼吁各级政府适当强化对草地的投资，使辽阔的草地资源得到合理开发和利用。
