The 1989 National Track Cycling Championship opened today at the Changping Race Track in the suburbs of Beijing. This competition serves as a warm-up event for the 11th Asian Games, with 14 teams from provinces such as Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, and Sichuan participating. The Soviet Union cycling team, which arrived in Beijing yesterday, also joined the competition. In the men's 200-meter individual sprint, the top five positions were all taken by Soviet athletes, while Wang Jun of the Beijing team secured the 6th place. In the women's 3000-meter individual pursuit, a surprising result emerged as Zhao Yi from Hebei team set a new national record with a time of 3 minutes 58.53 seconds (hand-timed), breaking the previous record of 4 minutes 1.81 seconds held by Shanghai's Lü Yuer for many years.
