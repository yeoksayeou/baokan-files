	When Will the Practice of Stealing Wood to Make Coffins End?

	In Yijiahe, Daluhuping Village, Sanxiaoqiao Township, Yongxiu County, Jiangxi Province, there are only 18 households. Almost every household employs outsiders to steal timber from state-owned forests to make and sell coffins. On April 4, the Yunshan Forestry Police Station conducted a raid on 14 households in this village and seized 16 complete coffins made from stolen fir wood (see right image), 2,200 unfinished coffin blanks (see upper image), totaling 150 cubic meters of timber.

	It appears that the management of state-owned forests is lax, and rural funeral customs have not been reformed, providing opportunities for those who steal wood to make coffins. How will the relevant local authorities handle this situation in the future?

    盗木制棺何时了！
    江西永修县三溪桥乡易家河大湖坪村，只有18户人家，家家户户常雇有外来民工盗伐国有林的树木，加工成棺材出售。4月4日，这里的云山林业派出所在对这个村的14户人家进行一次清查，竟查获他们用盗伐来的杉木加工制作的成品棺材16合（见右图），棺材坯料2200根（见上图），折合木材150立方米。
    看来，国有林的管理部门疏于管理，农村殡葬习俗不改革，给那些盗木制棺人以可乘之机。面对这种情况，当地有关部门今后怎么办？
