The U.S. Senate, after a heated debate, approved today by a 52-47 vote a U.S.-Japan agreement to jointly produce the F-SX fighter jet.

The U.S.-Japan agreement to jointly develop and produce the F-SX fighter jet was signed late last year by the Reagan administration and the Japanese government. This agreement has been criticized by opposing senators who fear that Japan might use the advanced U.S. technology in producing this aircraft to develop its own civilian aviation industry, thereby competing with the U.S. in the civilian aircraft market. However, those in favor of the agreement believe that the U.S. will benefit from this cooperation.

Today's Senate vote to approve the agreement is seen as a failure of the critics' attempt to veto the agreement.

According to the agreement, the U.S. will undertake 40% of the engineering work in the development stage, and the Bush administration has guaranteed that it will not transfer advanced technology to Japan.

It is expected that the House of Representatives will also approve this agreement.

　　美参议院激烈辩论后    
    批准美日生产战斗机协议
    新华社华盛顿５月１６日电  美国参议院在经过激烈辩论后，今天以５２票对４７票批准了美、日联合生产ＦＳＸ战斗机的协议。
    美日联合研制、生产ＦＳＸ战斗机协议是去年底由里根政府同日本政府签订的。这一协议一直遭到持反对态度的议员们的批评，他们担心日本可能会利用生产这种飞机的美国先进技术去发展它自己的民航工业，从而争夺美国的民航飞机市场。但是那些赞成这一协议的议员认为，美国将会从这一合作中得到好处。
    参议院今天投票批准这一协议被认为是批评者们试图否决这一协议的努力遭到了失败。
    根据这一协议，美国将在研制阶段承包４０％的工程，布什政府并保证不会把先进的技术转给日本。
    预计，众议院将肯定会批准这一协议。
