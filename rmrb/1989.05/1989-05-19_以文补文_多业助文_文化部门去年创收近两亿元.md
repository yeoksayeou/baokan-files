Currently, most cultural institutions in China are beginning to change their reliance on purely administrative subsidies for survival. The practice of using cultural activities to support cultural endeavors is flourishing. According to statistics from the end of 1988, 60% of China's cultural institutions have engaged in various forms of cultural support activities. There are 58,000 people involved, with a total business revenue of 740 million yuan, and a net income of 184 million yuan, which is equivalent to 16.3% of the state's cultural funding for that year.

The main forms of cultural support activities are as follows: First, providing paid services. Second, establishing cultural entities and cultural economic entities, combining culture with commerce, culture with enterprises, and culture with economics. Third, forming horizontal alliances to build cultural economic alliances between different regions, departments, and industries. Fourth, integrating cultural and economic trade activities, promoting the integration of culture and economics, and diversifying businesses to support culture. Fifth, seeking ways to combine culture and technology at a deeper and higher level, so that culture can directly serve economic construction.

　　以文补文　多业助文    
    文化部门去年创收近两亿元
    本报５月１９日讯  目前，我国大部分文化事业单位开始改变单纯靠行政拨款维持生存的半饥半饱状态，以文补文活动方兴未艾。据１９８８年年底统计，我国６０％的文化事业单位开展了多种形式的以文补文活动，从业人员达５．８万人，营业总额７．４亿元，补文纯收入１．８４亿元，相当于当年国拨文化经费的１６．３％。
    以文补文活动的主要形式有五。一是有偿服务。二是建设文化实体和文化经济实体，文商结合、文企结合、文经结合。三是横向联合，建立不同地区、不同部门、不同行业间的文化经济联合体。四是实行文化和经济贸易活动相联合，开展文经合流、多业助文活动。五是在深层次和高层次上谋求文化与科技“联姻”的途径，使文化直接为经济建设服务。　　　　　　（李得友）
