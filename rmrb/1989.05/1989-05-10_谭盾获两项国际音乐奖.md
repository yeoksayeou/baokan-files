Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 10th.

Tan Dun, a Chinese composer currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Columbia University in the United States, has recently won two composition awards.

The Bartók International Composition Competition, named after the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, delayed its results by two months this year due to the large number of participants. Tan Dun's "Nǚ" and the American composer Dodek B. Berev's "Illusion" both emerged as winners, sharing the first prize. The jury, based in Boston, described Tan Dun's work as "a highly individualistic modernist piece," noting that "his music, in addition to its profound philosophical depth, also stands out in its control of timbre, rhythm, and dynamics."

The New York State government awarded Tan Dun the composition prize, which is specifically commissioned for outstanding composers, because his large-scale opera "Nine Songs" is scheduled to premiere on May 12th in New York.

Tan Dun is the first mainland Chinese composer to receive this award.

　　谭盾获两项国际音乐奖
    新华社北京５月１０日电（记者邵建武）正在美国哥伦比亚大学攻读博士学位的我国作曲家谭盾最近连获两项作曲奖。
    以匈牙利作曲家名字命名的巴托克国际作曲比赛，今年因为参赛作曲家太多，比赛结果推迟了两个月才宣布。谭盾的《道极》和美国作曲家多德·伯雷夫的《幻象》终于脱颖而出，同获第一名。设在波士顿的评委会称谭盾的这一作品是“一部极具个性的现代主义作品”，“他的音乐除了深刻的哲理内涵外，音色、节奏和力度的控制也与众不同”。
    纽约州政府所以把专为委托杰出作曲家专题创作而设立的作曲奖颁发给谭盾，是因为他创作的大型歌舞剧《九歌》将于５月１２日在纽约公演。
    谭盾是获得这项奖的第一位中国大陆作曲家。
