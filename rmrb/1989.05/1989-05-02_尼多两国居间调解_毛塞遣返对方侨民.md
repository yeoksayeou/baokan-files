Nigeria and Togo have formed a joint delegation to mediate between Senegal and Mauritania in their conflict.

A joint delegation led by Nigerian Armed Forces Ruling Council member General Uga left here on April 30 for Dakar, the capital of Senegal. The delegation includes the Foreign Minister of Togo and the Nigerian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

Newsworthy sources say that after recent violent incidents of looting shops owned by immigrants from the other country in Senegal and Mauritania, both countries are now transporting their respective immigrants by air and land.

According to reports, Senegal, Mauritania, Algeria, Morocco, France, and Spain have all dispatched civilian and military aircraft to participate in the transportation of Senegalese and Mauritanian immigrants. Additionally, dozens of military trucks and buses have been mobilized.

It is estimated that since April 26, 11,000 Mauritanian immigrants have returned to their country, most of whom are women, children, and the elderly. However, approximately 15,000 Mauritanian men are still being protected by the military in the Dakar International Exhibition Hall.

On May 1, a group of Mauritanian immigrants waited in the suburbs of Dakar, the capital of Senegal, to be airlifted back to their country. According to reports, at least 55 Mauritanian immigrants were killed in the racial conflicts that occurred in Dakar last week.
