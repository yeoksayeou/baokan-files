	French overseas territory New Caledonia is experiencing political turmoil as the chairman of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front, Jean-Marie Tjibaou, was assassinated today on the island of Ouvéa. The front's general secretary, Yeiwéné Yeiwéné, also died in the attack.

	Tjibaou and Yeiwéné were killed while participating in a memorial event on Ouvéa Island for 15 Kanak people who died in clashes with French military police last year. It is believed that the assassination was carried out by members of an extreme left-wing faction within the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front.

	At 53 years old, Tjibaou had previously represented the Kanak people in negotiations with the opposing anti-independence faction and the French government in Paris, resulting in a compromise agreement on the future of the island.

	Following the assassination, French President Mitterrand sent a message of condolence to the families of the victims. Prime Minister Michel Rocard reiterated that the French government will continue to work towards achieving the reconciliation of New Caledonia that Tjibaou had sought. Rocard also announced that the Minister of Overseas Departments and Territories would be sent to New Caledonia to attend the funerals of the two leaders.

	New Caledonia is one of France's overseas territories in the South Pacific. The island's residents are divided into two major factions over whether to remain part of France or achieve independence, leading to frequent conflicts. The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front has consistently advocated for the island's independence.

    新华社巴黎５月５日电  努美阿消息：法国海外领地新喀里多尼亚的卡纳克社会主义民族解放阵线主席让—马里·蒂巴奥今天在新喀岛的乌韦阿岛遭到暗杀，同时遇难的还有该阵线总书记叶文纳。
    蒂巴奥和叶文纳是在参加乌韦阿岛群众悼念去年在同法国军警发生冲突中死亡的１５名卡纳克人的活动时被暗杀的。据认为，这次暗杀活动是由卡纳克社会主义民族阵线内部的极左翼组织成员干的。
    蒂巴奥今年５３岁，他曾在去年代表卡纳克人同反对独立的对立派以及法国政府在巴黎进行谈判，并达成一项关于该岛前途的妥协协议。
    暗杀事件发生后，法国总统密特朗致电慰问受害者家属。总理罗卡尔重申，法国政府将继续为完成蒂巴奥实现新喀岛和解的事业作出努力。罗卡尔还宣布将派遣海外省和海外领地部长前往新喀岛出席两位领导人的葬礼。
    新喀岛是法国在南太平洋的海外领地之一。该岛居民在新喀岛是继续留在法国还是实现独立的问题上分为两大派，并多次发生冲突。卡纳克社会主义民族阵线一贯主张该岛独立。
