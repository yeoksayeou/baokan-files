Accept Criticism and Resolutely Stop Bad Practices

Zhengyang County Cracks Down on Grain and Oil Adulteration

BEIJING — On March 31, the second page of the People's Daily published a letter to the editor titled "Grain and Oil Adulteration is Rampant in Zhengyang County." The county's Party committee and government leaders took this matter very seriously and convened a joint meeting of the county's Party committee and government to strengthen the supervision of grain and oil procurement.

They acknowledged that grain and oil adulteration does occur in Zhengyang. The problem is particularly severe among individual vendors, supply and marketing cooperatives, and grain departments involved in the procurement and sale of negotiated-price peanuts, rapeseeds, and sesame. A spot check of peanuts sent by the county's grain bureau to the grain and oil processing plant from local grain depots revealed an average impurity content of 20.6%.

While conducting widespread education among the peasantry on legitimate wealth accumulation, the county's Party committee secretary and deputy county governor, along with relevant departments, have developed a series of measures to prevent grain and oil adulteration.

　　接受批评　狠刹歪风
    正阳县制止粮油掺假
    本报讯  ３月３１日，《人民日报》二版刊登了河南《正阳县粮油掺假成风》的读者来信。该县县委、县政府主要领导对此十分重视，召开了县委、县政府联席会议，加强粮油收购工作。
    他们认为，粮油掺假在正阳确有此事，个体户、供销社、粮食部门收购销售的议价花生、菜籽、芝麻掺假尤其严重。抽查县粮食局粮油加工厂从基层粮所调来的花生化验，平均含杂２０．６％。
    在对全县农民群众普遍进行正当致富教育的同时，由县委常委、县政府常务副县长牵头，有关部门研究出杜绝粮油掺杂兑假的一系列措施。
