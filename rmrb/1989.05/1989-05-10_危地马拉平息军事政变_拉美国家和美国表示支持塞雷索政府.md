The Guatemalan government quashed a military coup organized by a right-wing group of officers this morning.

According to a report from Mexico City's television station, out of the 13 officers involved in the coup, 11 have been arrested. Four of these officers had participated in the failed coup attempt last May 11. Guatemalan Defense Minister Alejandro Gramajo declared that the military continues to support the country's democratic process. Guatemalan President Cerezo spoke to Mexico's Channel 2 this evening, stating that the situation is now under control. The coup was primarily due to internal disagreements within the military. No casualties were reported during the suppression of the coup. Cerezo also mentioned that after experiencing two failed coup attempts, Guatemala's democratic process has become more solidified. The Cerezo government is the first civilian government in Guatemala in nearly 30 years.

Mexican President Salinas called Cerezo today to condemn the right-wing military coup.

According to reports, the U.S. State Department spokesperson also stated that the United States welcomes the Guatemalan military's thwarting of the attempt to overthrow the Cerezo government.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on May 10, various Latin American countries and leaders issued statements and speeches on May 9, condemning the military coup that occurred in Guatemala that morning and supporting President Cerezo of Guatemala in his efforts to defend democracy.

The governments of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and Mexico urged the Organization of American States in Washington to support the Guatemalan government led by President Cerezo.

Colombian President Barco sent a message to President Cerezo, expressing that Colombia is "ready to continue cooperating with Guatemala to maintain democracy and peace in Central America."
