	Scholars from China and abroad have called for
	Strengthening Protection of Historic Cities
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 18 — (Reporter Wang Zhaolin) A group of experts and scholars in urban planning, architecture, cultural relics, and archaeology have urged that during the process of modernization, greater attention should be paid to the protection of cultural relics, ancient sites, and the surrounding environment in historic cities to preserve the unique character of these historic cities.

	Experts and scholars from the United States, Britain, Italy, and the Federal Republic of Germany, along with their Chinese counterparts, held an international academic conference in Beijing from May 12 to 16 on the theme of "Historic Cities and Modernization."

	Some experts and scholars pointed out that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of historical and cultural heritage. In addition to announcing three batches of key national cultural relics protection units, in recent years, two batches totaling 62 historic and cultural cities have been announced, shifting from the protection of individual relics to the protection of entire areas. Measures have also been taken to protect the surrounding environment and scenery of cultural relics and ancient sites, and to comprehensively protect the appearance of historic and cultural cities. Beijing, Xi'an, and other places have formulated regulations to control the height of new buildings in old city areas and to harmonize them with the style and color of ancient buildings. These efforts have been praised by people both in China and abroad. However, many cities have taken few strategic measures and major construction and renovation projects to maintain the ancient city's appearance.

	Experts and scholars from China and abroad exchanged views on the planning and strategies for protecting ancient buildings and sites and maintaining the original appearance of historic cities such as Beijing, Xi'an, Luoyang, Nanjing, Suzhou, Paris, Rome, Venice, Philadelphia, and Bath.

	Many foreign experts have raised objections to the trend of Chinese cities competing to build monotonous high-rise buildings, arguing that high-rise buildings do not equate to urban modernization. They suggested that instead of copying outdated Western practices, China should inherit and explore its own excellent architectural heritage. Experts also highly praised Nanjing's recent efforts to revitalize its ancient city culture, reconstructing the Fuzimiao cultural commercial street. They believe that this project successfully combines the restoration of the ancient city's appearance with the acceleration of old city renovation, recreating a social atmosphere with the charm of Eastern classical social culture.

　　中外学者呼吁
    加强对历史名城的保护
    新华社北京５月１８日电  （记者王兆麟）一批城市规划、建筑、文物、考古等方面的专家、学者呼吁在进行现代化建设的时候，加强对历史名城的文物、古迹及周围环境的保护，以保持历史名城的独特风貌。
    来自美、英、意、联邦德国的专家、学者和中国的同行一起，从１２日至１６日在北京举行了以“历史名城与现代化建设”为主题的国际学术讨论会。
    一些专家、学者指出，中国政府十分重视历史文化遗产的保护，除陆续公布了３批全国重点文物保护单位外，近几年又公布了两批共６２座历史文化名城的名单，使文物古迹由单体保护发展为成片成区的保护，并采取措施保护文物古迹的周围环境景观和对历史文化名城风貌的全面保护。北京、西安等地还制定法规，控制旧城区新建筑的高度，并使之与古建筑的风格、色彩相谐调。这些都受到中外人士的好评。但是，许多城市在保持古城风貌方面采取的战略措施和重大建设、改造项目还比较少。
    中外专家、学者在会上交流了北京、西安、洛阳、南京、苏州和巴黎、罗马、威尼斯、费城、巴斯等历史名城对保护古建、遗址和保持固有风貌的规划和对策。
    许多外国专家对中国城市竞相建造单调乏味的高层建筑提出异议，认为高层建筑不等于城市现代化，不要照搬西方已过时的东西，应该继承和发掘本民族的优良建筑遗产。专家们还对南京近几年利用古城文化遗产推陈出新，重建夫子庙文化商业街给予很高评价，认为它把复兴古城风貌与加速旧城改造很好地结合起来，再现了具有东方古典社会文化魅力的社会氛围。
