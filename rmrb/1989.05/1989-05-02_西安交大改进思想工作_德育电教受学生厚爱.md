The spacious classroom was packed, with people standing in the aisles, at the door, and even on the window sills. Some were even craning their necks to watch from below the television screen... This was the scene that a reporter witnessed in the moral education electronic classroom at Xi'an Jiaotong University.

The university began conducting moral education through electronic means for students in 1984. The school established a moral education electronic teaching leadership group and a moral education electronic teaching team, and built a dedicated classroom that can accommodate 1,000 people. Over the past five years, they have produced 58 moral education television programs, recorded and broadcast over 1,000 moral education television programs, held 545 screenings, and had 270,000 students view them.

Moral education through electronic teaching adopts two methods: organized broadcasts for students and utilizing extracurricular activities, weekends, and holidays to broadcast special programs. There are broadcasts five times a week. The content covers eight aspects: patriotism, communism, worldview, behavioral ethics, enrollment, graduation, and job assignment. Not only has it been praised by ideological educators and experts, but it has also been well-received by college students.

　　西安交大改进思想工作    
    德育电教受学生厚爱
    本报讯  宽敞的教室里座无虚席，过道里、门口前、窗台上也站满了人，连电视屏幕下也有人歪着脖子在仰看……这是记者在西安交通大学德育电教室看到的动人场面。
    这个学校从１９８４年开始对学生进行德育电化教育。学校成立了德育电教领导小组和德育电教组，建设了可容１０００人收看的德育电教专用教室。５年来，共拍摄德育电视片５８部，转录播出德育电视片１０００余部，放映５４５场，学生观看人数达２７万多人次。
    德育电教采取有组织地向学生播放和利用课外活动时间和周末、节假日播出专题节目两种方式，每周播放５次。内容有爱国主义、共产主义、人生观、行为道德、入学、毕业分配等８个方面，不仅受到思想教育工作者和专家的好评，而且受到大学生们的厚爱。
