	Hero in Distress: Report Touches Hearts
	Hunan Daily Establishes Award for Acts of Bravery

	Reported by our newspaper: The first fund in Hunan Province dedicated to rewarding acts of bravery—the Hunan Daily Liu Zuofa Bravery Award Fund—was officially established on April 29. This is one of the impacts of a report by Hunan Daily about a fire-fighting hero in distress.

	On April 12, Hunan Daily published an article titled "Fire-fighting Hero Liu Zuofa in Distress," which reported an unusual phenomenon: Liu Zuofa, a worker at the Changde 71 Mechanical Factory, had bravely rushed into danger four times to extinguish fires, saving two lives and a large amount of property. His deeds were praised by all, but after the fourth fire, in which he was seriously injured, his situation became pitiful: when he was admitted to the hospital, due to the doctor's negligence and a temporary lack of funds, he was tormented for over two hours before receiving treatment; by early April, the medical expenses of over 7,000 yuan were still uncertain to be reimbursed; his family in the countryside, due to his injury and hospitalization, was deeply in debt. His family members blamed him for doing a foolish thing, and others also sighed that doing good deeds was difficult.

	This report touched the hearts of many. That day, Provincial Party Secretary Xiong Qingquan, after reading it, immediately instructed the Provincial Civil Affairs Department to coordinate with relevant parties to quickly help Liu Zuofa solve his difficulties. The next day, he met with the reporter to give a talk, pointing out that this was a social problem. He suggested that Hunan Daily open a special column to discuss the "Liu Zuofa phenomenon" to conduct a round of ideological and moral education for the public, creating a social environment where heroes emerge in droves.

	Liu Zuofa's factory and people from all over the province also enthusiastically extended helping hands, donating money to him. In just over half a month, more than 10,000 yuan was donated, helping him initially get out of his predicament.

	Hunan Daily, seizing the opportunity, decided to establish the "Bravery Award Fund" in the newspaper.

　　勇士陷入困境　报道动人心弦
    湖南日报设见义勇为奖
    本报讯  湖南省第一个专为见义勇为者设立的基金组织——湖南日报刘作发见义勇为奖励基金会，４月２９日宣告成立。这是湖南日报一篇关于救火勇士陷入困境的报道所引起的效应之一。
    ４月１２日，湖南日报以《救火勇士刘作发陷入困境》为题，报道了一个“怪现象”：常德七一机械厂炉前工刘作发，先后４次奋不顾身为乡亲们扑救火灾，救了两条生命和大批财物，其事迹人人皆夸，但第４次救火受了重伤之后，其遭遇却显得可怜：入医院时，由于医生不负责任和一时少了钱，被折腾了两个多小时才得到治疗；到４月初，已花费的７０００多元医疗费还不知能否报销；他那安在农村的家，因他负伤住院而债台高筑。家里人怨他做了傻事，旁人也叹息做好人难。
    这篇报道牵动了许多人的心。当天，省委书记熊清泉看后，随即要省民政厅协同有关方面，尽快帮助刘作发解决困难。第二天，他又约见记者发表谈话，指出这是一个社会问题。他建议在湖南日报辟专栏讨论“刘作发现象”，以此对公众进行一次思想、道德教育，创造勇士纷出的社会环境。
    刘作发所在工厂及全省各地的群众也热情伸出援助之手，纷纷向他捐款，半个多月就捐赠了１万多元，使他初步走出了困境。
    湖南日报因势利导，作出在该报建立“见义勇为奖励基金会”的决定。
