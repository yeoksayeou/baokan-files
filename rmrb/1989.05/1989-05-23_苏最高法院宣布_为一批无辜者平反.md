The Soviet Supreme Court held a plenary session on May 22 and announced the rehabilitation of more than 50 people who were unjustly repressed during the 1930s and 1940s and in the early 1950s.

According to TASS, these individuals were wrongly accused of committing crimes that were particularly harmful to the state, receiving the longest possible prison sentences, and some were even executed. Viktor Sandler, a former member of the Comintern's liaison department, was repressed as a member of the Trotskyist anti-Soviet espionage and terrorist organization. The session found him innocent and restored his reputation.

Another innocent person, Viktor Suvorin, was convicted on fabricated charges, accused of participating in the "Trotsky-Zinoviev counter-revolutionary group," plotting and assassinating Kirov, and preparing a series of other terrorist acts against party and government leaders. The session also rehabilitated him.

　　苏最高法院宣布
    为一批无辜者平反
    新华社莫斯科５月２２日电  苏联最高法院２２日举行全体会议，宣布为３０—４０年代和５０年代初遭到无理镇压的５０多人平反昭雪。
    据塔斯社报道，这些人均被错误地认定犯有对国家特别有害的罪行，被判期限最长的徒刑，有些人则遭枪决。前共产国际执委会联络部工作人员维克托·灿德尔被当作托洛茨基反苏间谍恐怖组织的成员而遭镇压。会议认为他无罪，宣布为他恢复名誉。
    另一无辜者维克托·苏沃林当年是根据捏造的罪名被判刑的，指责他参加“托洛茨基—季诺维也夫反革命集团，策划并暗杀基洛夫，还准备对党政领导人采取一系列其他的恐怖行动”。会议也为他平了反。
