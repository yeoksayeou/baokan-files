Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 8th.

Japan's Mitsubishi Group is leveraging the opportunity to develop Japan's next-generation support fighter jet to significantly enhance its military software development capabilities, aiming to compete with major U.S. military software companies in the future.

According to a report by the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* today, due to restrictions imposed by the U.S. during negotiations on the joint development of the next-generation support fighter jet for Japan's Self-Defense Forces, Japan has decided to independently develop military software.

The Mitsubishi Group, which will receive government orders, places great importance on this type of research and development. It has decided to first involve its Mitsubishi Space Software Company in the research of the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI, or "Star Wars"), to acquire and accumulate specialized technologies. Simultaneously, it will expand the technical staff of the company to engage in the development of control weapon systems for Japan's next-generation support fighter jet.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries has already joined the research on the defense strategy for the Western Pacific region within the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative. Although this research is led by U.S. military software companies, the Japanese side is also quite active. One of its goals is to absorb advanced U.S. specialized technologies to serve Japan's military needs.

　　吸收美国技术为本国军事服务    
    日本三菱加强开发军用软件
    新华社东京５月８日电  日本三菱集团借研制日本下期支援战斗机的机会，大力加强开发军用软件的技术力量，争取将来能同美国的庞大军用软件公司平起平坐。
    据《日本经济新闻》今天报道，由于在日美关于联合研制日本自卫队下期支援战斗机的谈判中，美国方面表示要大幅度地限制向日本提供技术，日本决定独自开发军用软件。
    将接受政府订货的三菱集团对这类研究开发极为重视，决定首先让其三菱航天软件公司参加美国的战略防卫设想（星球大战）研究，取得和积累专门技术，同时扩充该公司的技术人员队伍，以便投入研制开发日本下期支援战斗机的控制武器装置的工作。
    三菱重工业公司业已加入关于美国战略防卫设想中西太平洋地区防卫设想的研究。这项研究虽以美国军用软件公司为主，但日本方面也相当积极，其目的之一是吸收美国先进的专门技术，以便为本国军事服务。
