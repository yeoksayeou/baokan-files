Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 30th

The second National Youth Games football qualifiers in Zhengzhou have seen repeated incidents of players chasing and attacking referees.

On the 28th, after the Jilin team lost 0-1 to the Henan team, Jilin players surrounded and attacked the referee. On the afternoon of the 30th, there was another incident where players from the Shaanxi and Shandong teams chased and attacked the referee on the field.

On the afternoon of the 30th, the matches between Guangdong and Shaanxi, and Shandong and Henan, were intense as both pairs of teams were fighting for a spot in the next round. The referee frequently showed yellow cards, but this did not completely stop the players from committing fouls such as tripping and pushing.

The Jilin, Shaanxi, and Shandong teams all lost 0-1 due to the referee's decision that their players had committed fouls in the penalty area, resulting in the opposing team scoring a penalty kick. After the three matches ended, several players from the Jilin, Shaanxi, and Shandong teams shouted "The referee is unfair" and rushed onto the field, holding their football boots, and chased after the referee.

　　青运会足球预赛赛风不正   
    运动员竟然追打裁判
    本报郑州４月３０日电  第二届全国青少年运动会足球预赛郑州赛区的比赛接连出现队员追打裁判事件。
    ２８日，吉林队０∶１负于河南队后，吉林队员围攻裁判。３０日下午又发生陕西队、山东队场上围攻追打裁判事件。
    ３０日下午，广东队和陕西队、山东队和河南队争出线权的角逐，火药味十足。裁判不时举起手中的黄牌，也未完全能禁止住场上队员踢绊、推拉的粗野动作。
    吉林、陕西、山东３个队都是由于裁判判其队员在禁区内犯规，被对方罚点球而以０∶１失利的。三场比赛结束后，吉林、陕西、山东三个队数名队员高喊“裁判不公”而冲入场内，手拿足球鞋，追打裁判。
