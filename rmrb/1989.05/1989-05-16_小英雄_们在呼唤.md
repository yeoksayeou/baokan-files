The little heroes are calling
By Yuan Jianda, People's Daily Reporter

The 14-year-old Northeastern boy Zhao Jinbao sat upright on the stage, his hands caressing the honor certificate with gold lettering, and in front of his eyes, the heart-pounding scene seemed to reappear.

It was May 1987 when the Great Khingan Mountains experienced a forest fire that shocked the world. At that time, Zhao Jinbao had already helped his sick mother out of the burning house. Suddenly, he remembered that his neighbor, Grandpa Xie, and the Li family were still in the fire zone. He then turned around and bravely rushed to rescue others. Grandpa Xie and the Li family were saved, but Jinbao was severely burned. His beloved mother was also taken by the fire.

Zhao Jinbao never imagined that while he was desperately rescuing others, some adults, who were 20 or 30 years older than him, brought fire trucks to protect their own homes, while others abandoned the crowd and fled for their lives. The noble qualities of a young man contrasted sharply with the despicable behavior of a few adults.

Little girl He Xiangjiao was a student at Jindong Primary School in Xunyang County, Shaanxi Province. On June 5, 1987, her hometown was hit by a flash flood, and more than 30 children were stranded on a sandbar in the middle of the river. He Xiangjiao, a 15-year-old girl who had already crossed the river to safety, knew that going into the river was dangerous. But to save her classmates, she bravely went into the water and headed towards the sandbar. Xiangjiao rescued three classmates, but she herself was swept away by the surging current while trying to save the fourth classmate, sacrificing her precious life.

He Xiangjiao was a hero to the children, and at the same time, she was a mirror for many adults. When a person falls into the water, or when someone is being harassed by a criminal, often hundreds or thousands of onlookers stand by and do nothing, indifferent and numb. If He Xiangjiao were to appear before them, would these people feel ashamed and embarrassed?

Compared to the many little heroes who have done righteous deeds and saved others at the cost of their own lives, the story of Cai Jianhua, a female student from Yifeng County, Jiangxi Province, seems ordinary and simple. For four years, she took care of an elderly person who lived alone, helping the old person with cooking, medical care, and sharing her thoughts. She never told her teachers about her good deeds. She thought, "I only took care of one old person. How embarrassing it would be if everyone knew!"

It is worth mentioning that Cai Jianhua's parents are also kind-hearted people. They supported their daughter's actions, and whenever there was something good to eat at home, they always encouraged their daughter to take it to the old person.

Cai Jianhua's behavior makes one think of the moral and spiritual qualities that are lacking in many people today. On public buses, some fashionable young women refuse to give up their seats for women carrying children; on the streets, a fallen blind person not only receives no help but is also surrounded by onlookers. To be honest, society does not expect everyone to have noble virtues, but at least there should be some public morality and basic human decency.

Recently, 18 young children were named "Little Heroes of China" by a Chinese women's organization. The touching stories of these "little heroes" enlighten millions of adults and call for the emergence of many "big heroes." As the famous educator Ye Zhishan said in an article, "After reading the stories of the little heroes, I feel both ashamed and frightened: their actions are things I cannot do; their qualities are things I cannot achieve. It is clear that I cannot do it or achieve it, and I can only sincerely learn from the little heroes."

May our country have more heroes—"little heroes" and "big heroes"!

### “小英雄”们在呼唤

　　“小英雄”们在呼唤
    本报记者  袁建达
    １４岁的东北少年赵金宝端坐在主席台上，双手抚摸着烫金的荣誉证书，眼前仿佛又出现了那惊心动魄的一幕。
    那是１９８７年５月，大兴安岭发生了那场震惊世界的森林火灾。当时，赵金宝已经扶着患病的妈妈离开了着火的房屋，突然，他想起邻居谢爷爷和李婶母子还在火区，于是毅然转身，奋不顾身地去抢救他人。谢爷爷和李婶母子得救了，金宝却被大火烧成了重伤。他亲爱的妈妈也被火魔夺去了生命。
    赵金宝怎么也想不到，就在他奋力抢救别人的同时，那些比他大二三十岁的成年人，有的调来消防车保护自己的小窝，有的丢下群众抱头逃命。一位少年的崇高品质与少数成年人的卑劣行径形成了鲜明的反差。
    小姑娘何香姣是陕西省旬阳县金洞乡中心小学学生。１９８７年６月５日，她的家乡山洪爆发，三十多名孩子被围困在河中心的沙洲上。已经过河到了安全地带的１５岁女孩子何香姣，明知下河危险，但为了救同学，还是勇敢地下水走向沙洲。香姣救出了三位同学，而她自己，却在救第四位同学时被汹涌的激流卷走，献出了宝贵的生命。
    何香姣是孩子们的英雄，同时，她也是许许多多大人的一面镜子。当一个人落水，或一个人受到歹徒凌辱时，往往有成百上千的围观者袖手旁观、麻木不仁，如果何香姣出现在他们的面前，不知这些人会不会脸红心跳、羞愧难当？
    与众多的见义勇为、舍己救人的小英雄相比，江西省宜丰县女学生蔡建华的事迹显得平凡而朴素。她四年如一日照料一位孤身老人，帮助老人做饭、看病，跟老人说心里话。她做的好事从没告诉给老师。她想：“我仅仅照顾了一位老人，让大家知道了多不好意思！”值得一提的是，蔡建华的父母也是乐于助人的好人，他们支持女儿的行动，家里有什么好吃的，总是鼓励女儿给老人送去。
    蔡建华的行为，不由得使人联想到目前在很多人身上缺乏的那种道德、那种精神。在公共汽车上，某些时髦女郎死活也不肯把座位让给抱孩子的妇女；在马路上，摔倒的盲人不仅没有人扶，反而有人围着看热闹……说实话，社会并不奢求每个人都有高尚的品德，但至少要有一点公德，一点起码的为人之道。
    １８名少年儿童日前被中国的妇女组织命名为“中国小英雄”。“小英雄”的动人事迹启迪着千百万成年人，呼唤着“大英雄”的大量涌现。正如著名教育家叶至善在一篇文章中所说：“看了小英雄的材料，我又惭愧又惶恐：他们的行动，都是我做不到的；他们的品格，都是我达不到的。做不到达不到是明摆着的，我只有真心实意向小英雄们学习。”
    愿我国涌现出更多的英雄——“小英雄”和“大英雄”！
