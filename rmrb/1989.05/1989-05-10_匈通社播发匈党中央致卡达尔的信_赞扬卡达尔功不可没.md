Hungarian News Agency, Budapest, May 9th.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee sent a letter to János Kádár stating that due to his "serious illness," he had to be relieved of his duties as party chairman and central committee member.

The decision to relieve Kádár of his party duties was made at the party's Central Committee plenary session held on May 8.

The Central Committee's letter, broadcast by the Hungarian News Agency this evening, praised Kádár for his "fight as a communist for social perfection, national prosperity, and socialism, which has earned him respect and admiration from the people." It stated that "domestic and international public opinion considers him a politician with indelible merits," and that "people will not forget Hungary in the 1960s and 1970s." However, the letter also mentioned that over the past 15 years, despite objective difficulties, "some wrong decisions have exacerbated the difficulties, and the Hungarian people and the Hungarian party must face the consequences."

Currently, Hungary is evaluating its history over the past 40-plus years, with more than 30 of those years under Kádár's leadership.

On the same day the Hungarian Party Central Committee held its plenary session, at a meeting of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, someone publicly proposed that Kádár should be held responsible for the arrest and execution of the leading figures of the 1956 events, including Nagy.

　　匈通社播发匈党中央致卡达尔的信    
    赞扬卡达尔功不可没
    新华社布达佩斯５月９日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党中央致信卡达尔·亚诺什说，由于他“病情严重”，不得不免除他的党主席和中央委员的职务。
    关于免除卡达尔党内职务的决定是匈党８日举行的中央全会上作出的。
    匈通社今晚播发的党中央信件赞扬卡达尔“作为一个战斗的共产党人，为社会完善、祖国繁荣、社会主义而进行的斗争，赢得了人们的尊敬和赞扬”，说“国内外舆论都认为您是一位具有不可磨灭功绩的政治家”，“人们也不会忘记６０年代和７０年代的匈牙利”。但信同时也谈到，在过去的１５年中尽管有客观困难，但“一些错误决定也加重了困难的程度，匈人民和匈党必须正视其后果。”
    目前，匈牙利正在对过去４０多年的历史进行评价，而其中有３０多年是在卡达尔领导之下。
    就在匈党中央举行全会同日，在匈牙利科学院全体会议上，有人公开提出卡达尔应对逮捕和处决１９５６年事件的头面人物纳吉负责。
