A female accountant from Guizhou embezzles a large sum of money and flees abroad, only to be extradited back to China

	The People's Daily reports: Deng Anwei, a female accountant from the Agricultural Bank of China's Sandu Branch in Baiyun District, Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, colluded with an individual transporter, Song Shunwen, to embezzle over 140,000 yuan from the bank and fled abroad. After being extradited back to China, the case was investigated by the procuratorial authorities and concluded. Recently, the Baiyun District Procuratorate filed a public prosecution with the Guiyang Intermediate People's Court.

	In March 1986, Song Shunwen, an individual transporter from Baiyun District, was introduced to Deng Anwei and opened a bank account in the name of "Shunwen Service Department" at the Sandu Branch. Soon after, Song applied for a loan of 20,000 yuan from the branch, claiming to use it for modifying his vehicle. Subsequently, Deng and Song became close, and their illicit relationship began. In November 1986, Deng and Song conspired to embezzle over 140,000 yuan from the branch in seven separate instances using forged and fraudulent means. Shortly after, their affair was exposed, and they hastily purchased a car and fled the country with the embezzled funds. In August 1987, Deng and Song were captured by the Burmese government's immigration authorities after fleeing to Burma. Through negotiations with the Burmese authorities, Deng and Song were extradited back to China in October 1988.

　　贵州一女会计贪污巨款    
    潜逃出境又被引渡回国
    本报讯  贵州省贵阳市白云区农业银行沙文营业所女会计邓安薇，勾结个体运输户宋顺文，贪污农行巨款１４万余元，逃往国外。被引渡回国后，经检察部门侦查终结，于日前由白云区检察院向贵阳市中级人民法院提起公诉。
    １９８６年３月，白云区个体运输户宋顺文经别人介绍认识了邓安薇，便以“顺文服务部”名义通过邓在沙文营业所开设了银行帐户，随即又以其汽车改型为由，向该营业所贷款２万元。此后邓、宋二人来往密切，并勾搭成奸。１９８６年１１月，邓、宋二人密谋策划，采取假冒欺骗手法分七次将该营业所的１４万余元资金贪污。不久，邓、宋奸情暴露，便匆匆购买一辆汽车，携巨款偷渡出国。１９８７年８月，邓、宋二犯逃到缅甸境内，被缅甸政府移民局抓获。经我国有关部门与缅方交涉，于１９８８年１０月将邓、宋引渡回国。
