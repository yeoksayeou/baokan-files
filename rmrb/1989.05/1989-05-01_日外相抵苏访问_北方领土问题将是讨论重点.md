Japanese Foreign Minister arrives for visit
North Territory issue to be main discussion point

	NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Uno arrived here today for an official visit. He will discuss Japan-Soviet relations, the situation and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region with Soviet leaders.

	Bilateral relations, especially the North Territory issue, will be a key point in the talks. Last December, when Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze visited Japan, the two countries decided to establish a standing body at the deputy foreign minister level to study the signing of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty. This body has already held two meetings on the main obstacle to the signing of the treaty—the issue of the four northern islands. Both sides held firm to their positions, and the talks made no progress. Recently, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Rogachev reiterated that the islands of Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan, and Habomai have "belonged to Russia since ancient times"; the Japanese side emphasized that the 1855 Japan-Russia treaty stipulates that these four islands belong to Japan.

	Local Japanese sources believe that the Soviet Union's stance on the issue of the four northern islands is harder than before, and Foreign Minister Uno is visiting at a time when Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita has decided to resign, so the foreign minister's visit is unlikely to achieve any results. The main purpose is to maintain dialogue and continue to exchange views.

	After visiting Moscow, Foreign Minister Uno will go to Mongolia and China for visits.

　　日外相抵苏访问    
    北方领土问题将是讨论重点
    新华社莫斯科４月３０日电（记者王宪举）日本外相宇野今天抵达这里进行正式访问。他将与苏联领导人讨论日苏关系、亚太地区形势与合作等问题。
    双边关系，特别是北方领土问题将是双方会谈的重点之一。去年１２月苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽访问日本时，两国决定成立一个副外长级的常设机构研讨签订苏日和平条约问题。该机构已经就签署和约的主要障碍——北方四岛问题举行了二次会谈。双方各执己见，会谈没有取得进展。日前，苏联副外长罗高寿重申，齿舞、色丹、国后、择捉四岛“自古以来”就是俄国领土；日本方面则强调，１８５５年日俄条约规定，这四岛属于日本。
    此间日本人士认为，苏联在北方四岛问题上的立场比前些时候强硬，宇野外相又是在日本首相竹下登决定辞职的背景下来访的，因此外相的这次访问不会取得什么成果，主要目的是保持对话，继续交换意见。
    宇野外相在访问莫斯科后，将去蒙古和中国访问。
