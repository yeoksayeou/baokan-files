News Summary

From May 2nd to 3rd, Prince Norodom Sihanouk held a two-day meeting with Hun Sen, the prime minister of the Vietnamese-backed Phnom Penh regime, in Jakarta. This was the fourth round of talks between the two sides. The previous three rounds failed to make any progress due to Hun Sen's refusal to accept Prince Sihanouk's proposals. Last November, Prince Sihanouk stated in Paris that if Hun Sen rejected his peace proposals, he would no longer meet with Hun Sen. This round of talks was arranged after Hun Sen claimed he would make certain "concessions." However, Hun Sen's performance in the talks was disappointing.

Firstly, Hun Sen still refused to accept the proposal that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be supervised by the United Nations, instead emphasizing the issue of foreign aid cessation after the withdrawal. Hun Sen repeated the words of Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach, saying, "Unless the United Nations leaves the Cambodian seat vacant and corrects past erroneous resolutions, we cannot consider the supervisory role of the United Nations."

Prince Sihanouk insisted that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be conducted under effective international supervision. He said that if Vietnam did not agree to United Nations supervision, an international conference could be held in Paris to resolve the issue of the international supervisory body. Due to Prince Sihanouk's persistent insistence, Hun Sen reluctantly agreed but insisted on expanding the "international supervisory body" designated by Vietnam and requiring Prince Sihanouk to agree that after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, the various Cambodian factions would not accept foreign aid.

Secondly, Hun Sen continued to refuse to dissolve the Phnom Penh regime. Before the talks, Hun Sen announced changes to the national name, national anthem, national flag, and constitution, attempting to replace the dissolution of the Phnom Penh regime with these changes. He threatened, "If during the talks, Sihanouk brings up the issue of dissolving the Phnom Penh regime before elections, I will not discuss it." However, Prince Sihanouk did not abandon his principled stance. He sent Prime Minister Son Sann to talk with Hun Sen. Son Sann pointed out in the talks, "The aforementioned series of 'changes' by the Phnom Penh regime were all unilateral decisions and did not obtain the agreement of the four parties." "Especially the constitution of the Phnom Penh regime, whether amended or not, is what the foreign army imposed on the Cambodian people. It cannot reflect the will of the people." Son Sann demanded the dissolution of the Phnom Penh regime and the establishment of a four-party coalition government, but this was rejected by Hun Sen.

To prevent his puppet regime from being dissolved, Hun Sen suggested in the talks that Prince Sihanouk return to Cambodia to assume a leadership role. Prince Sihanouk said that unless the Vietnamese troops completely withdraw from Cambodian territory under effective international supervision, and a temporary coalition government including the "Khmer Rouge" is established, making Cambodia a multi-party state, he would not accept it. Hun Sen also proposed organizing a general election by the so-called "Supreme Council," which was also rejected by Prince Sihanouk.

A spokesman for the Sihanouk side said that Hun Sen's so-called "concessions" were merely traps aimed at preserving the Phnom Penh puppet regime.

Thirdly, Hun Sen still insisted on excluding the "Khmer Rouge." He used the prevention of the "Khmer Rouge" from regaining power as an excuse to refuse the dissolution of the Phnom Penh regime. He claimed that dissolving the Phnom Penh regime would lead to domestic chaos, civil war, and create conditions for the "Khmer Rouge" to regain power. In the talks, he particularly emphasized the exclusion of the military force of the "Khmer Rouge," refused to consider the "Khmer Rouge" participating in politics, and advocated for a future government organized by two or three factions, or only considering a small number of "Khmer Rouge" participating in politics. Hun Sen's stance, of course, would not be accepted by Sihanouk.

In addition, Hun Sen still refused Prince Sihanouk's proposal to reduce the military forces of all factions to 10,000. In the talks, he insisted on maintaining the original military strength of each side, with each faction's military forces remaining in their originally occupied areas until the election, and then the new government would organize a new army. Observers here believe that the Phnom Penh regime's refusal to disarm is aimed at preserving its strength, unwilling to give up the territory seized by the Vietnamese army, and attempting to gain advantages in the election.

Hun Sen's aforementioned performance led to the conclusion that Vietnam and its puppet regime have not changed their fundamental stance and still lack sincerity in politically resolving the Cambodian issue.

　　洪森表现仍令人失望
    本报记者  刘爱成
    ５月２日至３日，西哈努克亲王与越南扶植的金边政权总理洪森在雅加达举行了两天会谈。这是双方进行的第四轮会谈。前三轮都因洪森拒绝接受西哈努克亲王的建议而没有取得任何进展。西哈努克亲王去年１１月在巴黎曾表示，如果洪森拒绝他的和平建议，他将不再会见洪森。这次会谈是在洪森声称他将作某些“让步”的情况下才促成的。然而，洪森在会谈中的表现却令人失望。
    首先，洪森依然拒绝越南撤军必须由联合国监督的主张，而过于强调越南撤军后外国停援问题。洪森重复越南外长阮基石的话说，“除非联合国使柬埔寨席位空缺并改正过去的错误决议，我们才可以考虑联合国的监督作用。”
    西哈努克亲王仍然坚持越南撤军必须在有效的国际监督下进行。他说，如果越南不同意由联合国监督，可以在巴黎召开一次国际会议解决国际监督机构问题。由于西哈努克的一再坚持，洪森勉强同意，但坚持在越南指定的那个“国际监督机构”基础上扩大，并要西哈努克同意在越南全部撤军后柬各派不得接受外国援助。
    其次，洪森继续拒绝解散金边政权。洪森在会谈前就宣布改变国名、国歌、国旗以及修改宪法，企图以此来代替解散金边政权。他威胁说，“如果会谈中，西哈努克再次提出大选前解散金边政权之事，我就不谈了。”然而，西哈努克亲王并没有因此而放弃自己的原则立场。他派宋双总理与洪森会谈。宋双在会谈中指出，“金边政权上述的一系列‘改变’均属单方面决定，没有得到四方同意”。“尤其是金边政权的宪法，无论修改与否都是那支外国军队强加给柬人民的。它不能反映人民的愿望。”宋双要求解散金边政权，建立四方联合政府，但遭到洪森的拒绝。
    为了使其伪政权不致解散，洪森在会谈中建议西哈努克回到柬埔寨担任国家领导人。西哈努克亲王说，除非在有效的国际监督下越南军队从柬领土上全部撤走，建立一个包括“红色高棉”在内的四方临时联合政府，使柬埔寨成为一个多党制的国家，否则他是不会接受的。洪森还提出由所谓的“最高委员会”来组织普选，也遭到西哈努克亲王的拒绝。
    西哈努克方面一位发言人说，洪森的这些所谓“让步”只不过是些圈套，目的在于保住金边伪政权。
    第三，洪森仍然坚持排斥“红色高棉”。他把防止“红色高棉”重新掌权作为拒绝解散金边政权的一个借口。声称如解散金边政权就会引起国内混乱，发生内战，会给“红色高棉”重新掌权创造条件。他在会谈中特别强调排除“红色高棉”的军事力量，拒绝考虑“红色高棉”参政，主张由两三派组织未来政府，或者只考虑“红色高棉”一小部人参政。洪森这种主张当然不会被西哈努克所接受。
    此外，洪森仍然拒绝西哈努克亲王提出的将各派军队裁减到一万人的主张。他在会谈中坚持保持各方原有军事力量，大选前各派军队仍守留在原来的所占地区，待大选后由新政府组建新军队。此间观察家们认为，金边政权拒绝裁军，目的是想保存实力，不愿放弃越军为它打下的地盘，以及企图在大选中得到好处。
    洪森的上述表现，使人们得出这样的结论：越南及其傀儡政权基本立场没变，对政治解决柬问题仍然缺少诚意。
