The blossoming of peach trees and the greening of willows bring the croaking of frogs. Food enthusiasts once again think of the tempting "field chicken"—frogs. Frog legs, rich in nutrition and delicious in taste, have become a popular dish at banquets and family tables. The more people eat, the more they catch, and the trend of catching frogs is becoming more prevalent.

Everyone knows that frogs are beneficial insects. Overhunting will inevitably lead to an increase in pests and diseases in the fields, resulting in reduced grain yields. Therefore, relevant departments have taken various measures to ban the indiscriminate catching of frogs, and the media has also closely cooperated, but with little effect. The number of frogs sold in agricultural markets is increasing, and there are more frog legs on dining tables. The reason is simple: economic benefits and people's appetites are playing a leading role.

I believe that instead of expending great efforts to "ban," it would be better to promote breeding. Rural areas already have numerous specialized breeding households. Why not foster a group of specialized frog breeders? The science and technology departments can provide technical guidance, and the commercial departments can handle the purchasing, thus meeting the needs of citizens, increasing farmers' income, and releasing some frogs into the fields to promote agricultural production.

Large-scale breeding of frogs can also be exported to earn foreign exchange. Currently, the global market for frog legs is expanding, with some Asian countries exporting tens of thousands of tons of frog legs annually. This simple, convenient, and multi-beneficial endeavor, why not do it?

　　吃蛙和养蛙
    唐志新
    桃红柳绿，蛙声阵阵。
    食客们又想起了诱人的“田鸡”——青蛙。青蛙腿因其营养丰富，味道鲜美，已成为大小宴会乃至家庭餐桌上的一道好菜。多吃就要多捕，捕捉青蛙之风也日甚一日。
    青蛙是尽人皆知的益虫，狂捕滥捉，必然导致农田里病虫害增多，粮食减产。于是，有关部门采取多种措施，禁止滥捕青蛙，舆论机关也密切配合，但收效甚微。农贸市场上出卖青蛙的越来越多，餐桌上的青蛙腿有增无减。原因也很简单：经济效益和人们的食欲在起着主导作用。
    我认为，与其花大力气“禁止”，不如花大力气提倡饲养。农村已有了名目繁多的饲养专业户，何不再扶植一批饲养青蛙专业户呢？科技部门给予技术指导，商业部门负责收购，既满足市民需要，又增加农民收入，还可以把部分青蛙放入农田，促进农业生产。
    大量养殖青蛙，还可以出口赚取外汇。目前世界上青蛙腿市场越来越大，亚洲一些国家每年有上万吨青蛙腿出口。这种简便易行、一举数得的好事，我们何乐而不为？
