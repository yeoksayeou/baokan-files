Title: Remove the Trash from Books

I am a high school student. Books are our lifeblood; we yearn to gain nourishment from extracurricular reading. However, our reality is far worse than we imagined. Faced with the vast array of extracurricular books around us, we dare not take a single step beyond the boundaries. This is not because we are narrow-minded, nor is it due to interference from teachers or parents. It is because of those books—those large quantities of books infected with spiritual viruses and worthless junk books—that leave us with no choice.

Today, I take this opportunity to appeal to the relevant authorities and all enlightened individuals: let us stand up and remove the trash from our books. I also beseech those so-called "writers" who sit at home all day with nothing to do, whose fingers itch to write, to quickly put down their pen of sin and refrain from defiling the sacred Chinese language.

People generally do not oppose the prohibition of pornographic books, but I want to shout out today: pay attention to restricting those batches of worthless books!

In our class, many extracurricular books appear every day, but true pornographic books are very few. As high school students, we generally have the ability to discern and a sense of honor and shame. However, worthless books make up a significant portion. I randomly picked up two books, and after reading them, I felt cheated. The content was mostly about girls choosing husbands, sows giving birth to piglets, how many moles Zhang Ming has on his body, and how many hairs Li Ming has on his head. After reading a book, my mind was empty, and I had no idea what I had read. Didn't Mr. Ye Shengtao say long ago: "A book without genuine human experience, without noble thoughts, emotions, and will as its essence, can be called nonsense without exaggeration." But in our case...

I often hear that the prosperity and strength of a country are closely related to the quality of its citizens, and books are the main tool for improving the quality of citizens. But has no one weighed the quality of our publications? In this era of knowledge explosion, we need to obtain the most valuable information in the shortest time. Otherwise, we will forever be citizens of a third-world country.

On behalf of young people, I appeal to society: ban the publication of all harmful, useless, or low-value books. If a book does not have at least 80% of its content that is positively useful to society, it should not be published.

Esteemed predecessors and sages who write books: forgive my extreme words, and forgive us for not understanding the hardships of your work! For the sake of our country and humanity, for the sake of the sacred name of "book," for the sake of the phrase "reading is beneficial" being truly meaningful, and for the sake of your good name being remembered by future generations, wake up and see the reality before you. Hold your pen and treat life seriously!

　　请清除书中的垃圾
    湖北省云梦县第二中学  刘烛蚕
    我是一个高中生。书是我们的生命，我们渴望从课外书中索取营养。可是，我们的实况比想象的惨多了。面对身边浩如烟海的课外书，我们不敢越雷池半步。这不是我们固步自封，也没有老师家长的干涉。而是那书、那大批带有精神病毒的黄书和根本无价值的废书让我们无从选择。
    今天，借贵报的一角，我要向有关部门的同志和所有有见识的人们呼吁，起来清除书中的垃圾。并求求那些坐在家中成天没事干，手指头发痒的“文学家”，尽早扔掉手中罪恶的笔，请不要再玷污神圣的中华文字。
    禁止黄书的出版，人们一般是不会反对的，可我今天还要向大家叫喊：注意限制那些成批的废书！
    在我们班上，每天出现的课外书籍很多，真正属于黄色的是极少数。作为高中生，一般都有一定的分辨力和荣辱感。但废书却占了很大比重。我随便拈来两本，读后大呼上当，内容大都是姑娘选郎君，母猪下小仔，张明星身上有几颗痣，李明星头上有多少根头发之类。一本读完，我脑中空空，不知所云。叶圣陶先生不是早就说过：“书中没有真切的人生经验，没有高尚的思想情感、意志作为骨子。说它是一派胡言也不过份。”可在我们这里呢？……
    我常听说，一个国家的兴盛强大是同国民素质的高低密切相联的，书则是提高国民素质的主要工具。然而，就没有人权衡一下我国的书刊质量问题吗？知识爆炸时代，要求我们在最短的时间里获得最多最有价值的东西。否则，我们永远是第三世界国家的公民。
    我代表我们年轻人向社会呼吁：禁出一切有毒、无用或价值不高的书刊。每一本书没有８０％的内容对社会有积极的适用的价值，就不要出版。
    著书立说的前辈先哲们：原谅我的言辞偏激，原谅我们不能理解您们工作的艰辛吧！为了祖国和人类，为了书这一神圣的名称，为了“开卷有益”这个词名符其实，还为了您们的芳名遗香后世，清醒地看待眼前的一切，拿着手中的笔，严肃地对待人生吧！
