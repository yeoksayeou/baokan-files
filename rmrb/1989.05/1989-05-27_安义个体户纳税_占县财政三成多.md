Individual households in Anyi County contribute a significant portion of the county's fiscal revenue through taxation.

According to a report from the *Nanchang Evening News*, a considerable part of the fiscal revenue in Jiangxi Province's Anyi County comes from the taxes paid by individual households.

In recent years, the practice of combining industrial and commercial operations has become a crucial method for the development of individual and private enterprises in the county. The emergence of new individual and private enterprises has adjusted the economic structure of the entire county, making it the first instance in Jiangxi Province and a rare occurrence nationwide. Statistics show that in 1988, the taxes paid by individual households accounted for 46% of the county's total tax revenue, and individual household tax contributions made up 35% of the county's total fiscal revenue.
