China's largest audio-visual product publishing institution, the China Record Corporation, will, in accordance with international practice, award the "Gold Record" to outstanding singers, performers, and opera artists.

The "Gold Record" awarding activity originated in the United States. In 1942, RCA Records awarded the first "Gold Record" to the trumpet player Glenn Miller, in recognition of his record "Chattanooga Choo Choo" selling over one million copies. Later, this method of expanding influence was adopted by many countries' record companies.

Using the "Gold Record" method to honor outstanding artists is a first in the history of China's record development. Selecting the best from the numerous artistic categories and artists over the past 40 years is indeed a meticulous and complex task. Led by Liu Senmin, the general manager of the China Record Corporation, the committee has repeatedly discussed and determined the following selection criteria: The "Gold Record" will be awarded to performers or groups from different periods and artistic categories who have achieved high artistic accomplishments, are representative, have significant social influence, have high-quality production, and have large sales of records and tapes. In contrast, overseas "Gold Record" awards are usually based solely on sales volume.

According to relevant sources, this "Gold Record" award will recognize 87 records, of which 80 will be awarded to performers, and 7 will be given as special creation awards to lyricists and composers. The list of winners includes opera masters Mei Lanfang and Yu Zhenfei, and other winners will be announced at the award ceremony to be held in Beijing in June.

It is also known that the "Gold Record" will be awarded every two years in the future.

### 以艺术成就高　社会影响大为标准  我国将评选金唱片奖

　　以艺术成就高　社会影响大为标准
    我国将评选金唱片奖
    新华社北京电  （记者李光茹）我国最大的音像制品出版机构——中国唱片总公司将按照国际惯例，对一些卓有成就的歌唱家、演奏家、戏曲表演艺术家颁发“金唱片奖”。
    颁发“金唱片奖”的活动，起始于美国。１９４２年美国ＲＣＡ唱片公司将第一张“金唱片”授予小号演奏家格兰·密勒，以奖酬他灌录的唱片《查他奴加，啾、啾》的销量超过１００万张。以后，这种扩大影响的重要手段相继被许多国家的唱片公司所采用。
    采用“金唱片”方式表彰杰出的艺术家，在新中国唱片发展史上还属首次。要从４０年间众多的艺术门类和艺术家里优中选优，实在是件细致、复杂的工作。以中唱总公司总经理刘森民领衔的评委会反复研讨，确定了这样的评选原则：“金唱片”将授予不同时期、不同艺术门类中艺术成就高、有代表性、社会影响大、制作质量好、唱片和音带发行量大的表演者或团体。而海外的“金唱片奖”通常以发行量为唯一标准。
    据有关人士披露：这次“金唱片奖”共评出８７张，其中８０张授予表演者，７张作为创作特别奖奖给词、曲作者。获奖名单上有梅兰芳、俞振飞戏曲大师，其他获奖者只有到６月在北京举行的颁奖大会上才能知晓。
    另悉：“金唱片奖”今后将每两年评选一次。
