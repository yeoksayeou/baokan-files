The People's Daily published an article titled "Why Change the Old Face?" by Zheng Kaige on February 21, 1989, on page eight. The article criticized the construction of Famen Temple in Fufeng County, Shaanxi, and also implicated the restoration of the Great Wall, labeling it as "the result of a desire for grandeur and novelty," "stupid acts of destructive restoration," and "clearly deceitful." Such arguments are indeed hard to listen to and difficult to understand.

Firstly, what policy should we adopt towards cultural relics? Should we protect them or let them naturally disappear? I believe we should adopt a policy of active protection and development. By active protection, I mean taking effective measures to prevent cultural relics from being eroded or damaged by wind and rain, so that their artistic images can be preserved for posterity. By development, I mean conducting necessary repairs to better utilize their historical, artistic, and scientific value, to promote the ancient civilization of our motherland, and to educate people in patriotism. For example, the Terracotta Army was just a pile of rubble when it was first discovered in 1975. After more than a decade of protection, development, and restoration, it has now become a magnificent site, showcasing a world wonder. Zheng's article praises the ancient city of Loulan, which has turned into a sand dune in the desert. But what if, after several more years, the ancient city of Loulan is completely buried by the desert or eroded by wind and rain? At that time, what shape and charm would this ancient civilization's relic have? What would attract people to it? Therefore, the protection and restoration of cultural relics are not "stupid acts" or "deceitful." They are a great undertaking to promote the ancient civilization of our motherland, to inspire future generations, and to educate our descendants.

Secondly, we should guide our approach to cultural relics with new ideas. Nowadays, we live in a society developing a commodity economy, and tourism is booming worldwide. We should guide our approach with a commodity mindset, actively developing and utilizing the great cultural heritage of the Chinese nation to promote tourism. We should invest some effort in restoration, organization, and necessary facility construction. This not only benefits cultural exchange but also plays a very important role in economic development. To label this as "destructive" is somewhat inappropriate.

Thirdly, after the collapse of the pagoda at Famen Temple, four Buddha finger relics and a large number of gold and silver artifacts, silk, etc., were unearthed from the underground palace. These are rare in the world and provide valuable material evidence for our research on Tang Dynasty history, culture, and religion. They have attracted the attention of many people in the domestic and international religious and archaeological communities. We have restored the pagoda and underground palace, built a museum, and some commercial service facilities, providing basic amenities for visitors from all over the country. What is wrong with that? I do not understand what Zheng is worried about.

As for the restoration of ancient cultural relics, it should be planned and led, ensuring both the original appearance and durability. This is a basic requirement that everyone understands. The construction of the Famen Temple tourist area is under the leadership of provincial, municipal, and county authorities, based on full discussions by professional technical departments, and funded by the state, collectives, and the public. The restored Famen Temple pagoda uses a reinforced concrete structure, with the exterior adorned with brick and stone reliefs, completely preserving the original appearance and architectural style, and is durable. Currently, the construction of Famen Temple has taken shape, with a 47-meter-high pagoda standing tall. The museum's treasure hall displays exquisite gold and silver artifacts, and visitors come in droves. The ancient pagoda is enhanced and beautified, and visitors are delighted and reluctant to leave. How wonderful it is!

　　理应让古迹增色添辉
    豆宗林
    《人民日报》１９８９年２月２１日第八版发表了郑凯歌的《旧貌何须换新颜》的短文，对陕西扶风县法门寺的建设，进行了一番非议，并把长城的修复工程也拉扯上，冠以“贪大求新的思想作怪”，“‘破坏性修复’的蠢事”，“实有欺世之嫌”。这种论调，实在使人听之逆耳，思之费解。
    首先，我们对待文物古迹应采取什么方针？是保护还是任其自然消逝？我认为应当采取积极保护和开发利用的方针。所谓积极保护，就是要采取有力措施，使文物古迹免受风雨侵蚀或破坏，使它的艺术形象永存世间；所谓开发利用，就是要进行必要的修复，以更好地利用它的历史、艺术和科学价值，弘扬祖国古代文明，对人们进行爱国主义教育。如秦兵马俑在１９７５年时，还只是刚刚发现发掘的一片瓦碴滩，经十多年的保护开发和修复建设，才有今天雄伟的规模，给人们展现了世界奇迹的丰姿。郑文对沙漠中化为土丘的楼兰古城甚表赞慰，那么，再过若干年之后，楼兰古城连土丘也被沙漠湮没了或风雨侵蚀消逝了，那时，这古代文明的遗迹还有什么形象和魅力呢？还有什么吸引人之处呢？所以，对文物古迹的保护和修复，绝不是什么“作怪”和“欺世”，是弘扬祖国古代文明，激励后人，教育子孙的伟大工程。
    其次，对待文物古迹，要以新的思想观念为指导。现在是发展商品经济的社会，世界各国的旅游事业在蓬勃发展。我们应当以商品观念为指导，积极开发利用中华民族伟大的古代文化遗产来发展旅游业，花一些力气进行修复、整理和必要的设施建设。这不仅有利于扩大文化交流，而且对发展经济有很重要的作用。把这斥之为“破坏性”，未免有些出言有失。
    再次，法门寺宝塔倒塌后，在地宫出土了四枚佛指舍利和大批金银器、丝绸等，举世罕见。它对我们研究唐代历史、文化和宗教都提供了珍贵的实物资料，引起了国内外宗教界和考古界许多人士的关注。我们对宝塔和地宫进行了修复，建设了博物馆和一些商业服务设施，对各地游人提供一些起码的参观和吃住方便，这有什么不好呢？不知郑文之“忧”究竟为何？
    至于修复古代文物古迹，要有计划有领导地进行，在技术上既要确保原貌，又要坚固耐久。这是大家都清楚的基本要求。法门寺旅游区的建设正是在省、市、县领导之下，在专业技术部门充分论证的基础上，由国家、集体和群众集资兴建的。修复的法门寺宝塔的塔体采用钢筋混凝土结构，外表砌以砖石浮雕等，完全保持了原有的形象和建筑风格，且坚固耐久。目前，法门寺的建设已初具规模，高４７米的宝塔巍然耸立，博物馆内珍宝阁展出的金银器等精美绝伦，游人络绎不绝。真是古塔增色添辉，游人心旷神怡，留连忘返，何不快哉！
