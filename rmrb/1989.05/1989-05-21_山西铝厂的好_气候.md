During a visit to the Shanxi Aluminum Plant, we heard about several instances where the plant's leaders strictly disciplined themselves and led by example in rectifying work styles:

The Factory Director Lives in a Two-and-a-Half Room Apartment

The Shanxi Aluminum Plant is a large factory with ten thousand employees, equivalent to a "bureau-level" unit. According to regulations, factory-level leaders are entitled to live in spacious apartments. However, the plant's leaders and the Party Committee members all live in two-and-a-half room apartments, the same standard as engineers.

Em Yin originally worked as a deputy director at the Zhengzhou Aluminum Plant, living in a three-room apartment. Two years ago, he was transferred to the Shanxi Aluminum Plant as the director. His family of four now lives in a two-and-a-half room apartment. His wife, who is from Shanghai, said to him, "Following you, we keep moving to more remote places, and the apartments keep getting smaller." Em Yin replied, "You haven't seen that there are still over 400 households in the factory without apartments. Having two-and-a-half rooms is already quite good."

The factory has many young workers and newlyweds. Based on this situation, most of the newly built apartments are one-room or two-room units. The allocation of apartments prioritizes helping the masses in need, rather than adding luxury to the leaders' lives. A section chief in a secondary unit was demoted for falsely reporting his years of service and using a forged official seal to secure an apartment. The director of the Property Management Department was transferred for allocating an apartment to someone who was not eligible.

The Deputy Director's Daughter Stands Outside the Gate

The factory has a vocational school that primarily enrolls children of the factory's employees. After three years of study, they become skilled workers. Competition to get into the school is fierce. The daughter of Deputy Director Wu Jinxiang failed the entrance exam twice, missing by just a few points. The son of the chief of the Dispatching Office, Yang Xizhen, also failed to get in due to insufficient scores. They are both influential figures in the factory, and with just a word, their children might have been able to get in. However, they did not use their influence. The factory director and secretary also did not intervene, saying: "If we open this 'back door,' it will disrupt the rules, and no one will be able to control the situation."

Natural reduction in workforce and recruitment is another test. Their method is to publicly post the list and invite public supervision. This year, 20 new workers were recruited. After the first posting, the public pointed out that 5 did not meet the criteria. After verification, 5 new candidates were selected. After the second posting, it was found that some still did not meet the criteria, and they were replaced again. The list was posted three times until all candidates met the criteria before the final decision was made.

Leaders Do Not Eat When They Go Down to the Work Sites

The aluminum plant has a rule: factory leaders going to sub-factories or construction sites for inspections are not allowed to be entertained or fed. They say: it is acceptable to entertain guests from higher authorities or neighboring units appropriately, but entertaining within the unit, eating and drinking, and giving gifts is too vulgar.

The factory has a construction company. In February, they invited the factory leaders to "listen to a report" at the company. Director Em Yin agreed to go. As he walked out of the office building, he noticed several cars parked outside and about twenty section chiefs and directors also invited to "listen to the report." He sensed that something might be amiss. Upon arriving at the construction company, he saw cigarettes, sunflower seeds, and fruits laid out, ready for the meal. Em Yin said, "Listening to a report is just that, listening to a report. Since the items are prepared, let's give them to the workers who are about to start the trial run!" It was the same construction company that, to facilitate future dealings with the factory, sent blankets to relevant department heads. After the Party Committee discovered this, they confiscated the blankets, sent them to the guesthouse, and publicly criticized the incident.

The leaders in this factory also do not visit the grassroots level or the homes of the people during festivals and holidays.

When discussing the above incidents, the leaders of the Shanxi Aluminum Plant believe that there are many problems in the current party and social atmosphere. Although we do not have the ability to rectify the entire party and society, we can certainly create a good "microclimate." A good "microclimate" will also have a positive influence on the overall "macroclimate."

　　山西铝厂的好“气候”
    李德民　刘东华
    在山西铝厂采访，听到厂领导严于律己，带头端正风气的二三事：
    厂长住房两间半
    山西铝厂是个万人大厂，属“司局级”。按规定厂级领导可以住较宽敞的房子，可是，厂领导和党委的领导同志都只住两间半房，和工程师同样的标准。
    尹协澄原来在郑州铝厂当副厂长，住三间房，前年调到山西铝厂当厂长，一家４口，只住两间半。他爱人是上海人，对老尹说：“跟着你越走越偏僻，房子越住越小。”老尹说：“你没看全厂还有４００多缺房户，有两间半就不错了。”
    这个厂青工多，新婚夫妇多，根据这个“厂情”，建起的房子大多是一间的，两间的，分房注意先给群众“雪中送炭”，不忙给领导“锦上添花”。有位二级单位的办公室主任在分房中虚报工龄，私盖公章，被查出后，撤职。房产科长因为给不该分房的分了房，调离。
    副厂长女儿门外站
    厂里有所技工学校，主要招收本厂子女，上学三年，就是技工。为使子女上技校，竞争激烈。副厂长吴金湘的女儿连考两年，因为差几分，进不了校门。总调度室主任杨希震的儿子也因考分不够进不了校门。他们都是厂里的“实权人物”，只要张张口，孩子也许能够进去的。可是，他们没张这个口。厂长、书记也不帮忙，他们说：如果这个“后门”一开，乱了规矩，谁也管不住了。
    自然减员后招工也是一个考验。他们的办法是张榜公布，请群众监督。今年招工２０人，张榜之后，群众反映有５人不符合条件，查证核实后重新换上５人，张榜之后又发现有不符合条件的，再换。张榜三次，直到全部合格后才定下来。
    领导下去不吃饭
    铝厂有个规矩：厂领导下分厂或施工单位检查工作，不准招待，不吃饭。他们说：上头和左邻右舍来人，适当招待是可以的，但本单位请吃请喝，送这送那，就太庸俗了。
    厂里有个建设公司，今年２月请厂领导到公司“听汇报”，厂长尹协澄同意去听。一走出公办楼，发现停了几部汽车，还有一二十位处长、主任也应邀去“听汇报”，感到这里面可能有问题。一到建设公司，发现摆着香烟、瓜子、水果，就等上酒菜了。老尹说：“听汇报就是听汇报，不要这样办事。东西既然准备了，就送给准备试车的工人吃吧！”还是这个建设公司，为了今后到厂里办事方便，给有关部门的领导送上６条毛毯。厂党委发现这件事后，予以没收，毛毯送到招待所，还公开进行批评。
    这个厂里的领导逢年过节也不到基层和群众家吃饭。
    在谈到以上几件事时，山西铝厂的领导同志认为，现在党风和社会风气中问题不少，我们虽然没有能力端正全党全社会的风气，但完全可以创造出良好的“小气候”，“小气候”对整个“大气候”也会有好的影响。
