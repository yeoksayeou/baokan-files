Central Television Station reporters' on-site interview records:

According to the Central Television Station's evening news on May 22:

▲ A woman pushing a bicycle on the street told the reporter, "As citizens of the capital, we can manage ourselves and maintain order by ourselves."

▲ A man said, "In the past, if cars bumped into each other on the street, people would argue. Now, people understand each other and just wave and move on."

▲ A man in his fifties said, "I am here on business from another province. Since the martial law was announced, I have observed that the traffic order on the streets is good. Although there are many people and vehicles, the order is very good because students are helping the police maintain order."

▲ The reporter asked a salesperson, "Is the supply of daily necessities still smooth?"

▲ The salesperson replied, "Yes, it's quite smooth, and there is no panic buying."

Central Television Station, May 22 news: Last night, rumors spread on the streets of Beijing that the military would suppress the students. Tens of thousands of citizens poured onto the streets and into the square. This rumor is related to the martial law announced on May 20. For this reason, early this morning, our reporter interviewed soldiers from a certain unit who came to Beijing to enforce martial law.

Reporter: What is your opinion on the statements made by Marshal Nie and Marshal Xu, which clarified some facts about Tiananmen Square?

Certain Unit Colonel A: We have not seen the news about Marshal Nie and Marshal Xu's statements.

Reporter: Can you tell us where your troops are now and why they have not entered Tiananmen Square?

Colonel A: Our troops are in Shijingshan and have not entered Tiananmen Square. We were blocked by the citizens and could not advance. The higher-ups ordered us to stay put.

Reporter: If there is a conflict between the troops and the students, will you avoid conflict with the students as Marshal Nie and Marshal Xu said?

Colonel A: Absolutely. And we are doing that now. After we arrived, we saw that the university students were quite rational, just as we thought, avoiding conflicts. We have been maintaining social order according to the Military Commission's requirements. But the citizens do not understand us, especially yesterday morning when many people said some unfriendly words. We have instructed the troops to ignore these and try to avoid conflicts. In this regard, the university students have also helped us a lot. So far, our troops have not had a single conflict with the university students and citizens.

Our soldiers have been on the vehicles all day yesterday, under the sun, without food, but they have strictly followed the discipline. Today, the higher-ups ordered us to withdraw, but due to various reasons, we have not withdrawn. Our soldiers did not bring blankets or raincoats, and now they are all lying on the ground. Just now, I looked around and felt very sorry for them. I told our officers that after four o'clock, the weather will be cooler and more humid, so we should wake the soldiers up, let them sit for a while, and then return to the vehicles.

Colonel B: After we arrived here, today, the Capital Steel Company solved our food and water problems. They sent us bread, steamed buns, porridge, and pickled vegetables.

Reporter: Is there still a possibility that the troops will enter the city?

Colonel A: Just now, I went to the front and saw that there are still many citizens blocking the way. In this situation, we are also in a difficult position. The higher-ups ordered us to withdraw, but we have not been able to withdraw.

Reporter: When you received the order, did it explain the situation in Beijing?

Colonel A: At that time, we were told to come to Beijing to maintain order and security.

Reporter: What was said during the pre-battle mobilization to the combatants?

Colonel A: It was very clear. We said that according to the higher-ups' requirements, we came to Beijing to maintain order. We should love the capital Beijing, love the people of Beijing, and love the university students. We have educated the troops. I think our soldiers have performed very well. We can't eat, drink, or sleep, but it's okay, we just can't stand the atmosphere. Our soldiers have not violated discipline.

　　中央电视台记者现场采访录
    据中央电视台五月二十二日晚间新闻：
    ▲街头一位推自行车的妇女对记者说，作为首都公民，我们能够自己管理自己，自己完全能够维持好秩序。
    ▲一位男子说，过去街上车碰着车就要吵架，现在能互相理解，招招手就走了。
    ▲一位五十来岁的男子说，我是外地出差来京的，从打戒严令发布之前，据我观察，街头交通秩序是好的，虽然人多，走车也多，但秩序非常好，因为有学生在帮助警察维持秩序。
    ▲记者问一位售货员：“现在副食品供应还畅通吧？”
    ▲售货员：“对，挺畅通的，而且也没有什么抢购的。”
    中央电视台五月二十二日消息：昨天晚上，北京街头流传着部队要镇压学生的说法，几十万市民涌向街头，涌向广场。这种谣传与五月二十日发布的戒严令有关。为此，今天凌晨本台记者采访了前来北京执行戒严任务的某部官兵。
    记者：聂帅和徐帅的讲话，澄清了天安门广场上的一些事实，您能不能对此发表一下看法。
    某部上校甲：聂帅和徐帅讲话的新闻我们没有看到。
    记者：那您能不能说一说您的部队现在在什么地方，为什么没有进入天安门广场呢？
    上校甲：我们的部队是在石景山，没有进到天安门广场。我们受到了人民群众的阻拦，没有办法前进。上级让我们原地待命。
    记者：如果发生部队与学生的冲突，你们会不会像徐帅和聂帅说的那样，避免和学生发生冲突？
    上校甲：完全可以，并且我们现在也正是这样做的。我们来到之后，看到大学生比较理智，和我们想的一样避免发生冲突。我们来到以后，也是按照军委的要求维护社会秩序。但人民群众不了解我们，尤其是昨天上午很多人说了一些不友好的话。我们教育部队对于这些不要理睬，尽量避免发生冲突。在这一方面，大学生也协助我们做了许多工作。到目前为止，我们的部队没有与大学生和人民群众发生一次冲突。
    我们的战士昨天一天在车上，太阳晒，吃不上饭，但是他们都严守纪律。今天（上级）让我们撤回去，但是由于种种原因没有撤回。我们的战士没有带被子，雨布也没有，现在都躺在地下。刚才我看了看，也非常心疼。我告诉我们的干部，四点之后，天气凉了，也很潮，要把战士叫醒，起来坐一坐，再回到车上。
    上校乙：我们到了这里之后，今天首钢为我们解决了食物和饮水问题，他们送来了面包、馒头、稀粥和咸菜。
    记者：现在部队进城的可能性还有吗？
    上校甲：刚才我上前边看了一看，阻挡的人民群众还比较多。处于这样的情况，我们也非常难办。上级让我们往后撤，但是撤也没能撤出去。
    记者：您接到命令的时候，说明了北京市是什么情况吗？
    上校甲：当时，对我们说是到北京来执勤，维护首都治安。
    记者：战前动员，对指战员们讲了些什么？
    上校甲：讲得很清楚，我们说按照上级的要求，来到北京执勤，应该热爱首都北京，热爱北京市人民，热爱大学生，我们对部队进行了教育。我认为我们的战士表现得是很好的。我们吃不上饭，喝不上水，睡不了觉都没事，只是受不了这个气。我们的战士没有违反纪律的。
