Reporter Yu Qing reports from Tokyo: In the opening match of the fifth China-Japan Go tournament, 18-year-old Chinese Go player Yang Shihai, a 3-dan, defeated the Japanese team's first player, Yoshida Kiyoshi, a 7-dan, by half a point. As Nie Weiping put it, the strength comparison between the two players was 1.5 to 8.5 in favor of Yoshida. The result of the match, as described by the chief editor of the Japanese Go Association's "Go Way" magazine, was unexpected and shocking.

The match took place on the seventh floor of the Japanese Go Association. The game began at 10 AM, with Yang Shihai playing black and making an error by playing a small target and a carefree corner. Yoshida employed the "cosmic style" and set up a three-star formation. In the early stages, Yang Shihai fought for territory, while Yoshida focused on creating a good shape. By midday, Yoshida was leading, which was the consensus among the spectators. However, Yang Shihai remained calm and tenacious, steadily narrowing the gap. By noon, Yang Shihai had used 50 minutes less than Yoshida.

In the afternoon, the game became increasingly complex, making it difficult to predict the outcome. The Japanese side did not expect Yoshida, who had defeated six Chinese players in a row the previous year, to face such fierce resistance from an unknown 3-dan player. Entering the endgame, Yang Shihai made a series of brilliant moves, and the situation quickly turned in his favor. The analysis room, which included Nie Weiping, Lin Haifeng, Ohashi Hideyuki, and Ishida Yoshio, calculated that Yang Shihai might win by one or half a point. The two players continued to fight until 6:40 PM, lasting a total of 7.5 hours. Before the final count, Yoshida asked the referee who won. The referee announced that black (Yang Shihai) was leading by half a point, leaving Yoshida surprised.

At yesterday's opening ceremony, Yoshida had asked Zhang Xuan, "Where did Yang Shihai come from?" To this, Hao Keqiang had some thoughts: "It seems that this time, the strategy was correct, and the young players have the power to make an impact. We can't always rely on the central team; we should also use the local teams." Yang Shihai is not a national player; he was transferred from the Zhejiang team to participate in this competition. Yang was the champion of last year's Go Newcomer Cup and recently defeated the 9-dan player Qian Yuping.

The second match will be held on the 18th, where Yang Shihai will face the 37-year-old 9-dan player Sonoda Yuichi, who is twice his age.

　　第五届中日围棋擂台赛初战爆冷门    
    杨士海三段胜依田纪基七段
    本报东京５月１６日电  记者于青报道：中国１８岁的年轻棋手杨士海三段今天以半目之差战胜日方先锋依田纪基七段。用聂卫平的话说，双方实力对比，杨士海处于１．５∶８．５的劣势。对局结果，用日本棋院《棋道》杂志总编辑的话说，实出意外，深感震惊。
    对局在日本棋院七楼进行。上午１０点开局，杨士海执黑先走错小目和无忧角，依田施展“宇宙流”布下三连星。序盘杨士海拚抢实地，依田着意走出好模样。进入中盘，依田棋势领先，是观棋者的一致看法。但杨士海沉着冷静，步步咬紧。下至中午，杨士海所用时间比依田少５０分钟。
    下午开局，双方越走越细，胜负难以判断。日方没想到去年连胜中方６员大将的依田，会受到一位三段的无名小将如此顽强的抵抗。进入官子阶段，杨士海连施妙手，形势急转直下。对局研究室的聂卫平、林海峰、大竹英雄和石田芳夫细算结果，杨士海可能胜一目或半目。双方一直杀到傍晚６点４０分，共耗时７个半小时。数子结果发表之前，依田问裁判谁胜谁负。裁判宣布黑棋领先半目，依田感到意外。
    昨天的开幕式上，依田还问过张璇，杨士海是从哪里来的。对此郝克强也有一番感慨：看来此番用兵得当，年轻棋手有冲击力。不能老用中央部队，也应启用地方部队。杨士海并非国手，是为参加这次比赛，从浙江队调来的。杨是去年围棋新秀杯的冠军，不久前战胜过钱宇平九段。
    第二场对局于１８日进行，杨士海将迎战比自己年龄大一倍的３７岁九段棋手苑田勇一。
