The title of the novel "The Unit" immediately evokes complex associations. For us, the unit is not just a workplace, not just an office building and colleagues we see every day. The unit dominates every aspect of our existence. The novel begins with a dispute over the distribution of pears in the office, clearly indicating that the significance of the unit has permeated the minutiae of daily life. As the novel suggests, accommodation is a gift from the unit, the level of transportation to work depends on one's rank in the unit, whether a child can secure milk, or whether one can eat roasted chicken once a month, all these are indirectly linked to how well one is doing in the unit. Thus, the unit occupies most of our interests and energy. Joining the party, promotions, relationships with colleagues extend into our leisure time and are closely intertwined with our daily lives, forming an organic whole.

The various directors, section chiefs, and clerks are the visible aspects of the unit's reality. Besides these, the unit also has an intangible but real entity. One cannot see this entity in any office, but it controls everything like a spirit, intervening in all decisions with an invisible hand. This hidden power is so great that no one's wishes can be directly realized. Many things seem like pranks: two section chiefs are at a stalemate over the position of deputy director, but the vacancy is unexpectedly filled by Old Zhang; Old He in the section works hard to become a full deputy director, but the result of the movement is inexplicably another deputy director, Old He; Xiaolin curries favor with everyone for a house, and after many twists and turns, he gets it for completely different reasons. Such involuntary manipulations and unexpected outcomes often make one feel as if a temperamental, unpredictable character is controlling the unit. Because this entity is inaccessible and elusive, the sense of uncertainty and unpredictability is even stronger.

In contrast to the abstract but living "unit," the people within the unit are becoming more like puppets and symbols. Xiaolin's experience is a case in point: the unit is a place that eliminates individuality, even though these individualities do not affect their primary jobs. Old Qiao's hobby is rummaging through other people's drawers, indicating that personal privacy has no right to exist. Under the subtle influence of the unit's atmosphere, various unnecessary interests gradually wither away. People devote all their energy to guessing each other's intentions, scheming, studying the leader's expressions, and deciphering the subtle meanings in "communication" and "greetings." It can be said that the process of becoming adept in the unit is largely a process of de-individualization—this is also true for leaders. After Old Zhang is promoted to deputy director, how to greet people and how loudly to close the car door still follow certain rules. Personal eccentricities often annoy people, and "pride" is a label without content but always applicable. For these unremarkable, bland, and vulgar characters, unique names are meaningless. They prefer to be called common nicknames like "Old Zhang," "Xiaolin," "Old Bear," "Xiaopeng." These nicknames themselves imply the elimination of individuality, a certain subtle and appropriate familiarity—this is the standard interpersonal relationship in the unit.

The narrative language of "The Unit" is monotonous, dull, and verbose. This linguistic style matches the dull days in the unit. This novel does not show off cleverness in language, which precisely demonstrates the author's cleverness. However, in my opinion, the ambiguous relationship between Old Zhang and Old Qiao is somewhat superfluous. The cause and effect of the event seem false. Although the novel adds some interest and twists, I would rather it remained rigid to the end—this is more akin to people's years of monotonous experience in the unit.

　　简谈刘震云的《单位》
    钱宏
    《单位》——小说的标题即已引起人们的复杂联想。对于我们说来，单位不仅意味着工作场处，不仅意味着一幢办公楼和一些每日相见的同事。单位主宰了我们生存的方方面面。小说始于一场办公室的分梨纠纷，很显明单位的意义已经抵达日常现实种种琐微的角落。如同小说所提示的，寓所乃是单位的赐予，上班交通工具的等级取决于在单位的官衔，孩子能否订得起牛奶、一个月能否吃一次烧鸡，无不曲折联系到在单位混得如何。于是，单位占有了人们绝大部分的兴趣与精力，入党、提升、同事关系延展到人们的业余时间，并且同人们的衣食住行密切纠结为有机整体。
    林林总总的局长、处长至科员，这是单位现实可见的一面；除此之外，单位还有一个无形无影但又的确存在的实体。人们不可能在某一间办公室里窥见这个实体，但它却精魂般无所不在地控制了一切，以一只看不见的手有力地干预各项决策。这种隐蔽的力量如此之大，以至于所有人的意愿都不可能直线地变成现实。说起来许多事情都像恶作剧似的：两个处长为副局长的位置僵持不下，而这个空缺却意外地被老张填了上去；处里的老何费尽心机想从副处长转正，而运动的结果却莫名其妙地推出了另一个副处长老何；小林为了房子巴巴结结地讨好所有的人，几经曲折之后，如愿以偿竟然完全由于另一些原因。这种不由自主的摆布和阴错阳差的结局常常令人感到，仿佛一个脾气乖戾、喜怒无常的性格幕后操纵了这个单位。由于这个实体的不可接近，难以捉摸、祸福莫测之感更为强烈了。
    与抽象的、但又是活的“单位”相反，单位里的每个人正在趋于木偶化与符号化。小林的经历是一个现身说法：单位是一个驱除个性的地方，尽管这些个性并不影响本职工作。老乔的嗜好是翻检他人的抽屉，这表明个人隐私没有存在的权利。在单位气氛的潜移默化之下，种种多余的兴趣渐渐枯萎，人们全力以赴地互相揣摸，勾心斗角，研究领导脸色，咀嚼“通气”、“打招呼”里面的微言大义。可以说，在单位里磨练到熨贴自如的过程，很大程度上亦即非性格化的过程——这对领导干部也不例外。老张荣升副局长之后，怎样问候、车门碰得多响仍须遵循一定之规。个人标新立异往往招人生厌，“骄傲”是一个没有内容但却随时适用的标签。对于这些缺少光辉、平板猥琐的人物，独特的姓名甚至没有意义。他们更愿意得到像“老张”、“小林”、“老熊”、“小彭”这些通用代号，这些称呼本身就意味着消除个别，意味着全名与昵称之间某种含蓄适度的套近乎——这正是单位人事的标准关系。
    《单位》的叙述语言单调，乏味，啰嗦。这种语感吻合了单位沉闷的日子。这篇小说不在语言上卖弄聪明，这恰恰显示了作者的聪明。但是在我看来，老张与老乔暧昧不清这一段情节有些多余。事件的起因与后果都显出了虚假。虽然小说多出了点趣味，多出了点波澜，但我倒宁愿呆板到底——这更近似人们在单位里多少年如一日的经验。
