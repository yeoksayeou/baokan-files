The enlightenment function of the May Fourth New Literature includes two meanings: one is to use literature as a means to undertake the enlightenment work in the New Culture Movement, which can be called enlightenment literature; the other is to construct a new aesthetic spirit, which can be called the enlightenment of literature.

The May Fourth New Culture Movement was an enlightenment movement, which has been confirmed by a large amount of documentary evidence. As one wing and part of the New Culture Movement, the vernacular literature movement, which was the initial form of Chinese New Literature, inevitably had an enlightenment color. The enlightenment I am referring to here includes two meanings: the first meaning is that New Literature uses the reform of literary forms to meet the needs of enlightenment, using vernacular language to popularize new ideas, using literature as a means to undertake the enlightenment work in the New Culture Movement; the second meaning is that the process of New Literature's literary revolution is also the process of changing aesthetic concepts, using vernacular literature to construct a new aesthetic spirit. It breaks away from the outdated concept of "literature as a vehicle for moral teachings" in traditional literature, linking literature with self-awareness and individual self-awareness, and redefining in a modern sense what literature is. These two meanings of enlightenment, I call them enlightenment literature and the enlightenment of literature.

Enlightenment literature focuses on enlightenment, with literature existing as a means of enlightenment. This literary concept can be traced back to the political reform movement of the late Qing Dynasty. When bourgeois reformers carried out bourgeois enlightenment for the Chinese people burdened with two thousand years of feudal tradition, they naturally thought of the power of literature. Since the late Qing Dynasty, bourgeois politicians have used popular novels to propagate revolution and used popular songs to admonish the people, making enlightenment literature play a significant role in the bourgeois revolution, which is commendable. The May Fourth Movement, as an enlightenment movement in modern Chinese history, inherited the Xinhai Revolution and initiated the New Democratic Revolution, standing between two political revolutionary high tides. Its enlightenment tasks were quite complex. Generally speaking, the theme of enlightenment is also the theme of the times. Under the observation of the era's theme with multiple variations, the content of enlightenment also showed a multiplicity of phenomena, including enlightenment against imperialism and for national salvation, as well as enlightenment for democracy and science. There was also Marxist enlightenment, as well as humanist and individual liberation enlightenment. The vibrant new ideas stirred the May Fourth generation of intellectuals, and they first felt the power of these ideas from the era.

The enlightenment of literature focuses on literature, referring to the enlightenment in the ontological sense of literature. When New Literature replaced classical Chinese with vernacular language to express and vent the emotions of modern people, New Literature not only brought new ideas to people but also brought a completely different aesthetic experience from classical literature. This is a spiritual activity connected with the aesthetic feelings of 20th-century people. For example, writers rejected the principle of "literature as a vehicle for moral teachings" in traditional literature, using literary creation to express their own emotions and the naked likes and dislikes of individuals; writers used literary language to delve into the deep layers of human psychology, depicting the desires and pursuits that people cannot express under the suppression of social rational norms, depicting people's subconscious, dreams, and various abnormal mental phenomena; writers established Western-style literary forms using vernacular language, such as short stories, long novels different from chapter-based novels, as well as prose poetry, drama, and new poetry... These literary creations first refreshed the readers' outdated experiences in form and then in aesthetic content. This literary enlightenment began with a non-utilitarian pure aesthetic consciousness, which can be traced back to Wang Guowei's introduction of Kantian aesthetics. In Wang Guowei's view, philosophy and aesthetics cannot serve political and social utilitarian purposes. He introduced Kant's theory of "beauty itself as a purpose," believing that "not valuing the value of literature itself, but only seeing it as a means of political education" is indeed a desecration of literature.

These two enlightenments of New Literature have significant differences in nature, purpose, and tasks. However, they are not completely separate. They are two aspects of New Literature itself.

These two enlightenments of New Literature have significant differences in nature, purpose, and tasks. Enlightenment literature is a carrier of new ideas, and its intention is to serve the enlightenment of new culture, so it undertakes a non-literary task: such as turning the theme of the times into the creative theme, educating the masses, awakening the masses, taking certain phenomena in society as the purpose of creation to express, and finding answers to social problems through artistic images, etc. These are mostly topics in the fields of thought, philosophy, or other social sciences, which should be completed through education and other social science research. However, when everything is in ruins and the masses are still in a state of slumber, writers take on this mission without hesitation, making unique contributions to the enlightenment movement of new culture. The enlightenment of literature, on the other hand, appears in front of people in the form of new literary forms. Its intention is to build the aesthetic forms and aesthetic spirit of the 20th century, awakening readers' sensitivity to beauty and rediscovery, thereby improving and renewing the nation's aesthetic quality. If a person loses sensitivity to beauty, it is difficult to say that life still has vitality. Similarly, if a nation's aesthetic spirit is in a state of universal numbness, the nation's vitality will also wither. The enlightenment of literature is to enrich the enlightenment significance of new culture from this perspective.

However, these two enlightenments are not completely separate. In fact, they are not only two aspects of the new culture enlightenment movement but also two aspects of New Literature itself. Enlightenment literature does have a distinction between excellence and mediocrity. Excellent works, with the help of immortal artistic images, shout out to society to awaken people to recognize their own situation and the truth of society in the shock. Its value lies in the power of thought, the depth of insight, and the concern for life, but all these factors can only be completed through perfect artistic forms and rich artistic passion. Literature is an aesthetic process. It cannot be separated from thought content, but as a form of expressing thought content, literary works are completed through a language art that has been transformed into an aesthetic form. Literature is a language art, which distinguishes it from other art forms such as painting, music, dance, and sculpture; literature is a language art that has been transformed into an aesthetic form, which distinguishes it from philosophy, history, theory, and other prose forms composed of language and text. The deep thoughts, historical connotations, and social realism of literary works may become a criterion for judging the height of literary works' achievements, but they are not the basic components of literature as literature; New Literature first starts with a literary revolution, bringing a brand-new aesthetic experience with vernacular language. This is obviously not just to cater to the needs of enlightenment, but more importantly, it awakens literary self-awareness and aesthetic self-awareness, making literature fundamentally break away from the traditional limitation of "literature as a vehicle for moral teachings."

The May Fourth New Literature warriors Chen Duxiu and Lu Xun both held a dual literary perspective. The dual enlightenment activities that began in the 1920s did not completely change until the 1930s.

In "The Literary Revolution," Chen Duxiu proposed the "Three Great Principles," each of which is defined with lengthy modifiers, often making people feel bored. In fact, these modifiers can well explain Chen Duxiu's literary views. The "national literature" he mentioned should be understood as the nature of New Literature, but the modifiers he used are "simple" and "lyrical," which are characteristics of the literary form, not enlightenment; the "realistic literature" he mentioned should be understood as the creative method of New Literature, but it is different from the later definition of "realism." He used the modifiers "fresh" and "sincere," which are also characteristics of the literary form. Only the "social literature" item, with the modifiers "clear" and "popular," has the meaning of enlightenment. In another place, when he criticized the opposite of "social literature," "mountain and forest literature," he pointed out: "obscure and difficult, pretending to be famous works, of no benefit to the majority of the group," which also contains the meaning of enlightenment. Therefore, the first two items of the "Three Great Principles" refer to the "enlightenment of literature"; only the last item refers to "enlightenment literature." Chen Duxiu was the initiator of the New Culture Movement and the vanguard and guide of this enlightenment movement. How could he not know the logic of using literature as an enlightenment tool? However, when initiating the literary revolution, he had another consideration. Hu Shi proposed the "Eight No's," one of which is "must speak of substance," Hu Shi's explanation of "substance" is thought and emotion, "thought is like the brain of literature, emotion is like the soul of literature." But Chen Duxiu disagreed, he wrote to Hu Shi expressing his doubts: "In my opinion, to save the flaws of Chinese literature being verbose and empty, only the sixth item 'do not make meaningless moans' is enough. If you insist on 'speaking of substance,' its flaws will be no different from the saying 'literature as a vehicle for moral teachings.' Using literature as a means or tool, it must be attached to something else to exist. I think the works of literature, with the function of applied literature, are different. Its aesthetic value and skill, the value of literature and art existing independently, can it be easily erased? Is there no room for research?" This thought is obviously different from the enlightenment literary views of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, but it is in tune with Wang Guowei. Therefore, Chen Duxiu advocated realism, which is different from later people. He explained the "realism" school as "its focus is only on describing natural phenomena, with no sense of beauty, good, evil, right, and wrong, and no intention of punishment or exhortation in mind. The natural phenomena they describe are both principle and substance, beyond natural phenomena, there is no principle and substance." This obviously denies that literature has a social educational function independent of aesthetics. The so-called "both principle and substance" is that only through artistic description can people understand the meaning of thought from the aesthetic form. He opposed realism and idealism, advocating realism because it "describes society as it is, does not allow any other intentions, and falls into the trap of reason." In his view, idealism has a bit of the taste of "literature as a vehicle for moral teachings."

Another warrior of New Literature, Lu Xun, seemed to hold this dual literary perspective at that time. In "The Opinion on the Dissemination of Fine Arts," Lu Xun had an interesting discussion on fine arts, saying: "The essence of fine arts is indeed to spread true beauty to entertain people's emotions, which is better than its practical use, and is an unintended result," which is clearly from the aesthetic point of view to determine the task of "the enlightenment of literature," but he also considered that there is a need in society to make fine arts practical, and this need "is quite in line with the public opinion of the Chinese people today," so "he briefly discusses it." This tone is originally somewhat forced, from his discussion on the practicality of fine arts, one is "fine arts can show culture, and all fine arts can be used to prove the thinking of a time and a race, so it is also a manifestation of the national spirit. If the spirit changes, fine arts will follow it to change"; the other is "fine arts can assist moral fine arts, although it does not fully coincide with morality, but its power can deepen people's emotions and elevate people's aspirations, it can also assist morality for governance." These two points are aimed at improving national cultural quality and aesthetic taste, and also consider its practicality, that is, the task of "enlightenment literature." But even so, Lu Xun still adopted a very cautious attitude, he tried to start from the special function of fine arts (deepening people's emotions) to argue, and did not regard it as a simple tool of thought.

In Lu Xun's creative practice, this literary concept is also very prominent. Shouldering the mission of a pioneer, Lu Xun's novels in the early May Fourth period have a clear enlightenment color, but Lu Xun's best works have never given up the pursuit of aesthetic forms and have never been separated from vivid and rich artistic passion. Take "Diary of a Madman" for example. If its meaning is only to shout out "rituals eat people," then with a novel form that has neither a complete story nor a distinct character image, it is easy to become just a product of an idea. However, when we read this novel now, the first feeling we get is from the language form of this novel, its chaotic narrative form, its seemingly mad but not mad monologue-style argument, its melancholic and meaningful symbol of the moon, its excitement, loneliness, and even fear that seep through the lines and spaces, and even its aphorisms, descriptions, and sighs, give us an overall artistic feeling. In this artistic atmosphere, people are forced to reflect on the original sin of humanity and the hypocrisy of rituals. "The depth of expression and the special format" are the two indispensable factors for the success of this novel. The former is thought, and the latter is aesthetic, which is also a model of the high integration of "enlightenment literature" and "the enlightenment of literature." To talk about "Wild Grass," "Wild Grass" writes about dreams, writes about good stories, writes about the date tree in the autumn night, all of which are written beautifully, and it is difficult to say that it is aimed at a specific thing in real life. The feeling it gives to people is expressed through beautiful forms. If Chinese New Literature has the tradition of "the enlightenment of literature," then it should start from "Wild Grass."

The examples of some people and some works in the early New Literature mentioned here are not intended to establish any orthodox position for "the enlightenment of literature." The reason for such a discussion is only to restore some of the original appearance of the literary concepts in the early New Literature. "Enlightenment literature" and "the enlightenment of literature" were initially in a co-existing situation. This situation did not completely change in the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s, the three major literary societies had three tendencies in literary concepts: the theorists of the Literary Research Society replaced the "Three Great Principles" of the "New Youth" era with the concept of "literature for life," making the situation of two enlightenments equally important tilt towards "enlightenment literature," but this literary theory did not bring much influence to creative practice; after the rise of the Creation Society and others, they advocated "art for art's sake," which was to correct the bias of "for life" in theory and continue the tradition of "New Youth" against "literature as a vehicle for moral teachings," but similarly, this advocacy did not seem to bring actual results to creation; it was the Language Society, represented by the Zhou brothers, that inherited the path of "New Youth," treating thought enlightenment and literary enlightenment as a dual perspective. The Language Society writers, on the one hand, engaged in social battles with combative small essays, advocating civilized criticism, and directly fighting with the warlord government and its lackeys; on the other hand, they created literary works with beautiful forms, producing Lu Xun's prose poetry and other works, carrying out the enlightenment of literature. This dual enlightenment activity did not appear until the 1930s.

　　启蒙的文学与文学的启蒙   
    ——新文学初期的两种文学启蒙观
    陈思和
    五四新文学的启蒙作用应包含两种意义：一种是以文学为手段，承
    　　担起新文化运动中的思想启蒙工作，可称之为启蒙的文学；一种是建构
    　　新的审美精神，可称之为文学的启蒙。
    五四新文化运动是一场思想启蒙运动，这已为大量的文献材料所证实。作为新文化一翼和组成部分的白话文运动，也就是中国新文学的最初形式，它不能不带有启蒙色彩。我这里所说的启蒙应该包含两种意义：第一种意义是新文学用文体的变革来适应启蒙的需要，用白话通俗地传播新思想，以文学为手段，承担起新文化运动中的思想启蒙工作；第二种意义是新文学的文体革命过程也即是审美观念的变革过程，用白话文建构起一种新的审美精神，它摆脱了传统文学中“文以载道”的陈腐观念，使文学与人的自觉、个性的自觉联系起来，在现代意义上重新界定何为文学。这两种意义的启蒙，我把它们称作为启蒙的文学与文学的启蒙。
    启蒙的文学，重点在启蒙，文学是作为启蒙的手段而存在的。这种文学观念可以追溯到晚清政治维新运动，当资产阶级维新人士向载负着二千年封建传统的中国国民进行资产阶级思想启蒙时，他们自然而然地想到了文学的力量。晚清以降，资产阶级政治家利用通俗小说来宣传革命，利用通俗歌谣来警世谕民，使启蒙的文学在资产阶级革命中发挥出巨大的作用，其功不可没。五四作为中国现代史上的一场思想启蒙运动，它上承辛亥革命，下启新民主主义革命，处于两场政治革命高潮间的一个夹谷，其承担的思想启蒙任务是相当复杂的。通常来说，启蒙的主题也是时代的主题，在多重变奏的时代主题观照下，启蒙的内容也出现了多重性的现象，有反帝救亡的启蒙，也有民主与科学的启蒙。有马克思主义的启蒙，也有人道主义、个性解放的启蒙。生机勃勃的新思想激动着五四一代的知识分子，他们从时代中首先感受到的是这种思想的力量。
    文学的启蒙，重点在于文学，它指的是文学本体意义上的启蒙。当新文学由白话代替文言，以现代口语来表达和抒发现代人的情感，新文学就不仅给人带来了新思想，同时也带来了完全不同于古典文学的审美经验。这是与二十世纪现代人的审美情感相联系的精神活动。譬如，作家们否定了传统文学中“代圣贤立言”的文以载道原则，以文学创作来抒发自我情感，表现赤裸裸的个人所爱所憎；作家们以文学语言切入到人的深层心理结构，刻画人在社会理性准则压抑下无法表达的渴望和追求，刻画人的潜意识、梦、以及各种变态的精神现象；作家们用白话创立了西方意义上的文学样式，诸如短篇小说、不同于章回体的中长篇小说，还有散文诗、话剧、新诗……这些文学创作首先在形式上，其次在审美内涵上刷新了读者的陈旧经验。这种文学启蒙最初是以非功利的纯美意识为开端的，可以追溯到王国维对康德美学的介绍。在王国维看来，哲学与美学是无法为政治、社会功利服务的，他介绍康德关于“美本身是目的”的理论，认为“不重文学自己之价值，而唯视为政治教育的手段”，那实在是对文学的一种亵渎。
    　　　　两种新文学的启蒙在性质、宗旨、任务上都有很大的差别。但二者
    　　又不是截然分开的。它们是新文学本身的两个侧面。
    这两种新文学的启蒙在性质、宗旨、任务上都有很大的差别。启蒙的文学是传播新思想的载体，它的旨意在于为新文化的思想启蒙服务，因此它所承担的是一种非文学的任务：诸如把时代的主题演化成创作的思想主题，教育民众，唤醒民众，把社会上出现的某种现象作为创作的目的加以表现，通过艺术形象为社会问题寻找答案等等，这多半是思想领域、哲学领域，或者是其他社会科学方面的题目，本该通过教育以及其他一些社会科学研究来完成的。但在百废待兴，民众尚且处于昏睡之中时，文学家义不容辞地担任起这一使命，为新文化的思想启蒙运动作出了它独有的贡献。而文学的启蒙，则是以新文体的面目出现在人们面前，它的旨意在于建设起二十世纪的美感形式与审美精神，启发读者对美的敏感与重新发现，进而提高和更新民族的审美素质。一个人如果失去了对美的敏感，很难说生命还有什么活力，同样，一个民族的审美精神处于普遍的麻木状态下，民族的生命力也会因此而枯萎。文学的启蒙正是从这一角度来充实新文化的启蒙意义。
    但这两种启蒙又不是截然分开的。事实上，它们不但是新文化启蒙运动的两个侧面，也是新文学本身的两个侧面。启蒙的文学确有优秀与不优秀的分界，优秀的作品借助于不朽的艺术形象，向社会发出振聋发聩的呐喊，帮助人们在震动中认清自身的处境与社会的真相。它的价值虽是在思想的力量、见识的深刻以及对人生的关注，但所有这些因素都只能是通过完美的艺术形式和饱满的艺术激情来完成的。文学是一种审美的过程，它固然离不开思想内容，但作为一种思想内容的表现形式，文学作品是依靠一种转换成审美形态的语言艺术来完成的。文学是一种语言艺术，这使它有别于绘画、音乐、舞蹈、雕塑等其他艺术类种；文学又是一种转化成审美形态的语言艺术，这使它有别于哲学、历史、理论等其他用语言文字构成的散文类种。文学作品的深刻思想、历史内涵以及社会现实性，也许可以成为文学作品成就高低的一种判断标准，但不是文学之为文学的基本构成；新文学首先从文体革命着手，以白话带来崭新的审美经验，这显然不仅仅是为了照顾到启蒙的需要，更重要的，它唤起了文学的自觉、审美的自觉，使文学从根本上摆脱传统的“文以载道”的局限。
    　　　　五四新文学的战将陈独秀、鲁迅都是持二元文学观的。始于二十年
    　　代的这种二元的启蒙活动，到三十年代才出现分化。
    陈独秀在《文学革命论》中提出“三大主义”，每一项主义都以冗长的修饰词界定，这往往使人感到厌烦。其实这些修饰词是相当能说明陈独秀的文学观的。他所说的“国民文学”，应作新文学的性质来理解，但他使用的修饰词是“平易的抒情的”，都是指文体的特征，而不是思想启蒙；他所说的“写实文学”，应作新文学的创作方法理解，但这与后来认定的“现实主义”的定义也不同，他用的修饰词是“新鲜的立诚的”，同样是指文体的特征。唯“社会文学”一项，冠之“明了的通俗的”，才带有启蒙的含义。在另一处，他批评“社会文学”的对立面“山林文学”时指出：“深晦艰涩，自以为名山著述，于其群之大多数无所裨益”，也含有启蒙的意思。因此“三大主义”的前两项，指的是“文学的启蒙”；唯后一项，才是指“启蒙的文学”。陈独秀是新文化的倡导者，是这场思想启蒙运动的急先锋和指导者，他何尝不知以文学作启蒙工具的道理？但在发起文学革命时，他却有着另外一种考虑。胡适提出“八不主义”，有一条为“须言之有物”，胡适对“物”的解释是思想与感情，“思想犹如文学之头脑，感情犹如文学之灵魂。”而陈独秀不以为然，他致信胡适表示了质疑：“鄙意欲救国文浮夸空泛之弊，只第六项‘不作无病之呻吟’一语足矣。若专求‘言之在物’，其流弊将毋同于‘文以载道’之说。以文学为手段为器械，必附他物以生存。窃以为文学之作品，与应用文学作用不同。其美感与伎俩，所谓文学美术自身独立存在之价值，是否可以轻轻抹杀，岂无研究之余地？”这一思想显然与康梁的启蒙主义文学观相异，倒与王国维同调。由此，陈独秀提倡写实主义并不同于后人，他解释“写实主义”流派是“其目光惟在写实自然现象，绝无美丑，善恶，邪正，惩劝之念存于胸中，彼所描写之自然现象，即道即物，去自然现象外，无道无物”。这明显地否认了文学具有独立于审美以外的社会教育功能，所谓“即道即物”，也就是唯通过艺术描写，才能使人从美感形式中领悟到思想的意义。他把写实主义与理想主义相对立，提倡写实主义是因为它“如实描写社会，不许别有寄托，自堕理障”。而理想主义在他看来，多少有一点“文以载道”的味道。
    新文学的另一员战将鲁迅当时似乎也抱这种二元的文学观点。鲁迅在《儗播布美术意见书》中有一段对美术的论述颇有意思，他说：“美术诚谛，固在发扬真美，以娱人情，比其见利致用，乃不期之成果”，分明是从美学意义上来确定“文学的启蒙”的任务，但他又考虑到社会上确有将美术致用的需要，而这种需要又“颇合于今日国人之公意”，故“从而略述之”。这口气原本有些勉强，从他对美术致用性所论及的内容看，其一是“美术可以表见文化，凡有美术，皆足以征表一时及一族之思维，故亦那国魂之现象，若精神递变，美术辄从之以转移”；其二是“美术可以辅翼道德美术之目的，虽与道德不尽符，然其力足以渊邃人之性情，崇高人之好尚，亦可辅道德以为治”。这二条均是以提高民族文化素质与审美情趣着眼的，也兼顾到它的致用性，即“启蒙的文学”的任务。但即便如此，鲁迅仍然是采用了极为小心的态度，他努力从美术的特殊功能（渊邃人之性情）出发来立论，仍没有把它作为一种简单的思想工具。
    在鲁迅的创作实践中，这种文学观念也表现得异常鲜明。奉了先驱者的使命，鲁迅在五四初期的小说具有鲜明的启蒙色彩，但鲁迅最优秀的作品从来没有放弃过在美感形式上的探求和从来没有脱离过生动饱满的艺术激情。就说《狂人日记》，如果它的意义仅仅在于喊出“礼教吃人”的话，那么以既无完整的故事，又无鲜明的人物形象的小说形式看，它很容易成为只是一种理念的产物。然而现在我们阅读这部小说时，获得的感受则首先来自这部小说的语言形式，它的杂乱无章的叙事形态，它的似狂非狂的独白式议论，它的关于月亮的凄凉而充满意味的象征，它从字缝行间中透出激愤，寂寞，甚而悸怖的心境，甚至是它的警句，它的描写，它的叹息，给人一种整体性的艺术感受，在这种艺术氛围中逼使人对人类本体的罪恶感和礼教的虚伪性作出忏悔与反思。“表现的深切和格式的特别”，是这部小说之所以成功的两个不可或缺的因素。前者是思想的，后来是审美的，也正是“启蒙的文学”与“文学的启蒙”高度结合的典范。再说《野草》，《野草》写梦，写好的故事，写秋夜的枣树，都写得很美，很难说它针对现实生活中的某样具体事物，它给人的感受是通过美的形式表现出来的。如果中国新文学有“文学的启蒙”的传统，那么，它应该是从《野草》开始的。
    这里所举例新文学初期的一些人和一些作品，并非是想为“文学的启蒙”立什么正统地位。之所以这么论述，只是想还原出新文学初期文学观念的一些本来面目。“启蒙的文学”与“文学的启蒙”最初是处于并存的局面。这种状况到２０—３０年代尚未完全改变。２０年代，三大文学社团在文学观念上出现了三种趋向：文学研究会的理论家用“为人生的文学”观念来取代《新青年》时代的“三大主义”，使两种启蒙并重的局面朝“启蒙的文学”倾斜，但这种文学理论并未对创作实践带来多大的影响；创造社等异军突起后，提倡“为艺术而艺术”，在理论上是纠“为人生”之偏，继续《新青年》反“文以载道”的传统，但同样，这种主张也未见得给创作带来实际的后果；倒是以周氏兄弟为代表的语丝社，继承《新青年》的道路，将思想启蒙与文学启蒙作二元观，语丝社作家一边以战斗的小品文投入社会，提倡文明批评，与军阀政府及其帮闲展开直接的肉搏战；一边却以优美的形式创作文艺作品，出现了鲁迅的散文诗等，开展文学的启蒙活动。这种二元的启蒙活动，到３０年代才出现分化。
