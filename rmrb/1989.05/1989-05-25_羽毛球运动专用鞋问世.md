A type of comfortable, soft, highly elastic, and wear-resistant badminton-specific shoes has recently been successfully developed by the Chongqing Li Hua Rubber Shoe Research Institute.

This badminton shoe uses board-toe technology, strengthening the bond between the shoe upper and the sole, as well as the sole itself. The sole design features a large area of interlocking herringbone patterns, enhancing grip and facilitating movement. The forefoot and heel have two suction-cup-like circular patterns, allowing athletes to turn quickly and slide smoothly.
