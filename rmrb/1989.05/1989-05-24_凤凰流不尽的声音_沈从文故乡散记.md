It is raining outside the window. The rain is not heavy, and the sound of it falling on the leaves is very soft. I sit by the window, listening carefully to the sounds outside. When I came here, Mr. Huang Yongyu enticingly told me that in the evenings in Phoenix, you can hear the calls of ducks in the woods, and the sound of wooden clogs on the green stone slabs, making a clacking noise. I listen carefully, but all I hear is the sound of the rain. It is early April, not yet the season for the ducks to call, he regretfully told me.

This bedroom faces Nanhua Mountain. If it were daytime, you could vaguely make out the location of Wenchang Pavilion Primary School, where Shen Congwen attended. In 1982, Shen Congwen made his last trip back to his hometown, staying in this very bedroom at Mr. Huang Yongyu's house. It was May, the time when azaleas bloom, and perhaps also when the ducks call. If it were raining then, would Shen Congwen, who had been away from his hometown for so long, sit by the window, listening to the rain and the calls of the ducks?

He would. An old man returning to his hometown would find everything familiar from his childhood dear. Phoenix is such a small town, with such clear water, such green trees, and such lively little birds. Shen Congwen had long ago left his hometown, but their sounds were still in his heart. He once said that his childhood experiences cultivated his ability to discern sounds: the sound of bats, the sigh of a yellow cow as the butcher's knife pierces its throat, the hiss of a large yellow snake hidden in the soil of a field, the faint sound of fish breaking the water's surface in the dark... Although he left his hometown early, these sounds often triggered various dreams in him, causing him to lose sleep and enter a literary world. He said these dreams, "both took me back to that 'past' emptiness and also took me to a fantastical universe." I can hardly imagine how Shen Congwen could have created such a rich literary world without the water and sounds of his hometown.

Shen Congwen's love for the sounds of his hometown, that touching sentiment, I have directly experienced. Listening to the rain, I recall that scene and ponder what it is that keeps an old man who has experienced so much still pure and peaceful like water, retaining the simplicity of Xiangxi. It was in 1984, also in the spring, when I visited Shen Congwen, who was half-paralyzed. Knowing he loved music, I specially brought him a tape of Italian folk songs. He listened intently. We talked about Xiangxi, and Mrs. Shen especially mentioned that in 1982, when they returned to their hometown, they had watched folk artists perform the "Nuotang" opera. As soon as the words "Nuotang" were mentioned, I noticed Shen Congwen grinning, tears flowing, and laughing heartily. I was surprised by his childlike innocence. He then told me, "When I was a child, I played with my friends, sang songs, and watched operas. Now, as soon as I hear the folk songs and operas of my hometown, I get excited. Immediately, I think of the scenes from my childhood, and the tears just fall out." Shen Congwen, who was ill, spoke unclearly and quickly, but the thick Xiangxi accent, filled with sincerity, was just like his works, with a simple style and simple emotions.

In Phoenix, I saw the Nuotang opera that moved Shen Congwen. The melody of the Nuotang opera is not complex, similar to a refined folk tune, but it has a sad and somewhat mournful tone, far from the passionate and lively Huagu opera. Perhaps it is this sadness and the hometown dialect that deeply moved Shen Congwen. This troupe is called the Lanquan Troupe. People told me that in 1980, it was this troupe that sent a recording of the Nuotang opera "Returning a Vow" to Shen Congwen's home in Beijing. When it was played, Shen Congwen was also in tears, and he exclaimed, "Hometown dialect! It's been decades since I last heard the Nuotang opera. This is the real hometown dialect!" It was this visit that prompted Shen Congwen's last trip back to his hometown.

The Nuotang opera was the second performance I saw in Phoenix City. The first performance was not as impressive as the Lanquan Troupe, but the audience below was unforgettable. They were a group of tourists from Sweden, over thirty people, led by the sinologist Nils Borje. Nils Borje is a fan of Shen Congwen's works and had just published a collection of Shen Congwen's essays. He told me that these Swedish men, women, and children had all read Shen Congwen's "Border Town" and were "Shen Congwen fans." Their interest was not in the scenery of Zhangjiajie in Xiangxi, but in "walking the paths Shen Congwen walked." This was Nils Borje's second time leading a group here, and the number of people was greater. They visited Shen Congwen's former residence and other places in Phoenix, then went to the small town of Chadong, where "Border Town" is set, and Baojing and Wangcun, where Shen Congwen once served in the army... They were dusty and tired, but their enthusiasm and curiosity far outweighed their fatigue. Sitting with them, I seemed to truly feel the charm of Shen Congwen's voice for the first time; he connected people's hearts with his literature.

While watching the Nuotang opera, I thought that those Swedish "Shen Congwen fans" should really sit in the old theater and listen to the hometown dialect that Shen Congwen loved the most; while listening to the rain, I thought they should come to Phoenix when the spring rain falls and the ducks call, just like me, to listen to the sounds that Shen Congwen was once familiar with. Huang Yongyu said it was Shen Congwen who made the world know Phoenix. In fact, Shen Congwen does not belong to Phoenix alone; he belongs to China, he belongs to the world. People will forever hear the endless beautiful sounds from his works, these sounds come from his hometown, from his heart.

　　凤凰流不尽的声音
    ——沈从文故乡散记
    李辉
    窗外下着春雨。雨不大，落在树叶上的声音很轻。我坐在窗前，注意听着外面的声音。来到这里，黄永玉先生就很诱人地说过，在湘西凤凰家中，每到夜间，可以听到林中杜鹃的啼叫，木屐走在青石板上，嘎嘎发响。我注意听着，除了雨声，还是雨声。这是四月初，还不是杜鹃啼叫的时节，他遗憾地告诉我。
    这间卧室，面对着南华山，如果是白天，可以依稀辨认出沈从文的母校文昌阁小学的位置。１９８２年，沈从文最后一次回故乡，就住在黄先生家的这间卧室里，那是在五月，与黄永玉、黄苗子诸先生同行。五月，是杜鹃花盛开的时候，大概也是杜鹃欢叫的时候。如果也下着雨，久别故乡的沈从文，会不会痴痴地坐在窗前，听着雨声，听杜鹃声？
    他会的。一位老人重返故乡时，对童年熟悉的一切都会感到亲切。凤凰这样一个小城，这样清的水，这样绿的树，这样活泼的小鸟，沈从文早已在心里留下了它们的声音。他说过，童年的生活培养了他辨别声音的能力：蝙蝠的声音，一只黄牛当屠户把刀刺进它喉中时叹息的声音，藏在田塍土穴中大黄喉蛇的鸣声，黑暗中鱼在水面拨刺的微声……尽管早早离开了故乡，可它们常常诱发沈从文做出各式各样的梦，这些梦使他失眠，又使他进入一个文学的世界。他说这些梦，“既把我带回到那个‘过去’的空虚里去，也把我带往空幻的宇宙里去”。我难以想象，如果没有故乡的水，故乡的声音，沈从文怎么会创造出那样丰富的文学天地。
    沈从文对故乡声音的偏爱，那份动人的情感，我曾直接感受过。听着雨声，我回忆那个场面，寻思一个历尽沧桑的老人，究竟是什么使他永远保持着湘西的淳朴，水一般的纯净和平和。那是在１９８４年，也是春天，我去看望半身不遂的沈从文，知他爱听音乐，特地带去一盘意大利民歌磁带。他认真地听着。我们谈到了湘西，沈夫人特别提到１９８２年他们回故乡时，曾经观看过民间艺人演唱的“傩堂”戏。刚说到“傩堂”两个字，我便发现沈从文咧开嘴，眼泪流出，开心地大笑起来。我奇怪他这份顽童一样的天真。他随后告诉我：“我小时候和伙伴们玩，一起唱歌，看戏。现在一听到家乡民歌，家乡的戏，就激动。马上就想到了小时候的情景，眼泪不知怎么就掉出来了。”病中的沈从文说话并不清晰，也很快，但浓浓的湘西口音，含着真诚，和他的作品一样，风格是朴实的，情感是朴实的。
    在凤凰，我看到了令沈从文感动的傩堂戏。傩堂戏的曲调并不复杂，类似民间小调的再加工，但听到有一种感伤的情调，甚或带点悲凉，远不像花鼓戏那样炽热、活泼。大概就是这种感伤和乡音才使沈从文深深感动的。这个剧团叫兰泉剧团，人们告诉我，１９８０年，就是这个剧团将演唱的傩堂戏《还愿》的录音带送到北京的沈从文家中。播放时，沈从文同样是泪水满面，还大声说：“乡音！几十年没听到唱傩堂了，这是真正的乡音啊！”正是这一次促成了沈从文的最后一次故乡行。
    傩堂戏是我在凤凰城看的第二次演出。第一场演出并不像兰泉剧团这样给人深刻印象，但台下的一批观众却令人难忘。那是些来自瑞典的游客，三十多人，由汉学家倪尔思（Ｎｉｌｓ）领队。倪尔思是一位沈从文作品的喜爱者，他刚刚翻译出版了沈从文的散文集。他告诉我，这些瑞典的男女老少，都读过沈从文的《边城》，是“沈从文迷”。他们意趣不在湘西张家界的风光，而在“走沈从文走过的路”。这是倪尔思第二次组团前来，人数也更多。他们在凤凰参观沈从文故居等处，然后去《边城》所写的小镇茶洞、沈从文当年当兵住过的保靖、王村……他们风尘仆仆，但热诚、好奇远胜过疲劳，和他们坐在一起，我似乎第一次真正感受到沈从文的声音的魅力，他以文学沟通着人类的心灵。
    看傩堂戏时，我想，那些瑞典“沈从文迷”，真该坐在旧戏台前，听听沈从文最喜爱的乡音；听雨声时，我又想，他们该趁春雨落、杜鹃啼血的时候再来凤凰，像我一样听听沈从文曾经熟悉的声音。黄永玉说是沈从文让世界了解凤凰。其实，沈从文不仅仅属于凤凰，他属于中国，属于世界。人们会永远从他的作品中听到流不尽的美妙的声音，这声音源自故乡，源自他的心中。
