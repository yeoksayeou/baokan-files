Picasso's self-portrait "I, Picasso," painted when the artist was 20 years old, was sold for $47.85 million at Sotheby's auction house in New York yesterday. This makes it the second most expensive painting ever sold at an auction. The most expensive painting is Vincent van Gogh's "The Irises," which sold for $53.9 million in November 1987.

Picasso's self-portrait measures 29 inches in length and 24 inches in width. In this painting, the young artist Picasso is depicted sitting upright, wearing a loose yet well-fitting white shirt and an elegant orange-yellow scarf. The background is a deep blue color.
