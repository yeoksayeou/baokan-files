Restoring the Reputation and Position of Vocational Education

According to the diary of the late educator Huang Yanpei, in mid-September 1949, at the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference, Zhu De, Li Lisan, Ma Yinchu, Huang Yanpei, and others proposed that the education chapter of the Common Program should include a clause emphasizing the development of vocational education. Some participants opposed this, citing three reasons: (1) Vocational education is a product of capitalist countries; (2) The Soviet Union does not have vocational education; (3) Secondary and higher education already include vocational education. The debate resulted in Zhu De's proposal being rejected, and "technical education" was included in the Common Program instead. Since then, the concept of "vocational education" has been excluded from China's educational documents and practices. It was not until 1963, when Premier Zhou Enlai instructed to develop vocational education and the Ministry of Labor held a symposium on urban vocational education in Beijing, that the topic was raised again. However, at that time, the understanding of vocational education was incomplete, limited to primary vocational education, and due to the social and political situation, it did not have a significant impact.

Forty years later, re-examining that debate, it is clear that the three arguments against vocational education are all invalid. Not only is it wrong to view vocational education as a capitalist product, but the understanding of Soviet education was also inaccurate. This viewpoint has hindered the long-term development of vocational education in China and led to the complete shutdown of agricultural and vocational high schools during the Cultural Revolution, as well as the severe damage to secondary vocational schools and technical schools. This historical lesson should be seriously summarized.

It is well known that "vocational" and "technical" are two different categories. "Vocational" is formed through social division of labor, while "technical" refers to a system of specialized means and methods. Therefore, the connotations of "vocational education" and "technical education" are also different. In various levels and types of education, technical education content is included, but technical education cannot replace basic education, vocational education, or higher education. The 18th General Conference of UNESCO in 1974 proposed the use of the term "technical and vocational education," clearly distinguishing between the two.

Due to the substitution of technical education for vocational education, serious consequences have been brought to China's educational cause, as mentioned above. To rectify the situation, the 1982 Constitution of China stipulated the development of vocational education, which is entirely correct.

Subsequently, in the official documents of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, "vocational and technical education" replaced "vocational education," but the basis and reasons are unclear. However, the social consequence is that people still cannot form a correct understanding of vocational education, leading to its neglect and even the mistaken belief that technical education is superior to vocational education. A school that trains vocational education teachers originally planned to name itself ×× Vocational Normal College but feared it would be looked down upon and students would not enroll, so it was eventually named ×× Vocational and Technical Normal College. This created an extremely abnormal social psychology. Therefore, whether to use vocational and technical education to replace vocational education is not just a matter of terminology but a major issue concerning whether vocational education in China can truly develop smoothly in the future.

The basic meaning of "vocational education" is: education aimed at obtaining a certain social vocational qualification. "Vocational qualification" is a comprehensive vocational ability, including ideology and morality, vocational ethics, vocational knowledge, skills, techniques, and skills; including practical experience and vocational qualities necessary for engaging in a certain vocation. The concept of vocational education can more fully reflect the characteristics of this type of education. Vocational education includes vocational moral education, vocational technical education, and vocational guidance education, among others. Therefore, in terms of the relationship between part and whole, vocational technical education cannot replace vocational education. Using vocational technical education to replace vocational education lacks theoretical basis, and practical experience has proven it to be harmful to the development of vocational education.

Therefore, we suggest that state documents should scientifically classify and distinguish between vocational education and technical education. As a concept parallel to higher education and basic education, it should be called "vocational education." This way:

(1) It aligns with the provisions of the Constitution and thoroughly corrects the wrong views from the sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Preparatory Committee of the New Political Consultative Conference in 1949.

(2) The concepts in government documents should be scientific and standardized to clarify public understanding.

(3) It helps to reverse the tendency to belittle vocational education, assists in the formation of correct vocational consciousness, vocational concepts, and vocational ethics among vocational workers, and overcomes the non-vocational hierarchical consciousness in society, such as the pursuit of officialdom through education and the emphasis on promotion rates.

　　为职业教育正名定位
    中华职业教育社  王艮仲  饶博生
    据已故教育家黄炎培日记所载：１９４９年９月中旬在新政协筹备会常务会第六次会议上，朱德、李立三、马寅初、黄炎培等人提出，在《共同纲领》教育章内应列入重视发展职业教育的条款。会上一部分人反对，理由有三点：（一）职业教育是资本主义国家的产物；（二）苏联无职业教育；（三）中等、高等教育已将职业教育包括在内。争论结果朱德等人的意见被否定，而把“技术教育”写入共同纲领。从此“职业教育”概念在我国教育文件和实施中被摈弃。直至１９６３年周恩来总理指示要发展职业教育，劳动部在北京召开城市职业教育座谈会，才再次提出。但当时对职业教育的理解很不全面，仅指初级职业教育，而且由于当时的社会政治状况，实际上并未产生更大的影响。
    四十年后的今天重新检讨那次争论，很明显反对职业教育的三条理由均不能成立。不要说把职业教育视为资本主义的东西是错误的，就是对苏联的教育认识也不准确。这种观点使我国职业教育长期发展迟缓，并导致十年动乱中农业中学、职业中学全部下马，中专、技校破坏殆尽，普通中学恶性发展。这个历史教训，应该认真加以总结。
    众所周知，“职业”和“技术”是两个不同范畴的事物。“职业”是社会分工形成的，而“技术”则指一种专门的手段和方法的体系。所以“职业教育”和“技术教育”其内涵也是不同的。在各级各类教育中都包括有技术教育的内容，但不能以技术教育代替基础教育、职业教育或高等教育。１９７４年联合国教科文组织第十八届大会通过的《关于技术和职业教育的建议》中提出建议使用“技术和职业教育”名词，也是明确地把两者区别开来的。
    由于用技术教育代替了职业教育，给我国教育事业带来严重的后果，已如上述。为了拨乱反正，１９８２年我国宪法规定要发展职业教育是完全正确的。
    此后，在我国党和政府的正式文件中又以“职业技术教育”代替“职业教育”，其依据和原因不明。但造成的社会后果是使人们对职业教育仍然不能建立起正确的认识，轻视职业教育，甚至错误的认为技术教育要比职业教育高一等。某培养职教师资的院校原想定校名为××职业师范学院，但怕被看不起，学生不来上，最后决定称××职业技术师范学院。形成一种极不正常的社会心理。所以，能否用职业技术教育代替职业教育，就不是什么名词概念之争，而是关系到我国职业教育今后能否真正顺利发展的重大问题。
    “职业教育”的基本含义是：针对取得某种社会职业资格的教育。“职业资格”是一种综合的职业能力，包括思想品德、职业道德，职业的知识、能力、技术、技能和技巧；包括从事某种职业所必需的实践经验、职业素质等等。职业教育这个概念能更完整地反映这一类型教育的特质。在职业教育中既包括职业道德教育，也包括职业技术教育，还应包括职业指导方面的教育等等。所以就部分与整体的关系而言，不能以职业技术教育代替职业教育。用职业技术教育代替职业教育从理论上缺乏根据，实践经验证明对发展职业教育也是有害的。
    因此，我们建议国家文件应按科学分类把职业教育和技术教育区别开来。做为与高等教育、基础教育等并列的概念，应称“职业教育”。这样：
    （一）与宪法的规定一致，并彻底地对１９４９年政协筹备会常务会第六次会上那场争论中的错误意见给以纠正。
    （二）政府文件中的概念应该科学和规范化，以正视听。
    （三）扭转轻视职业教育的思想，有助于从职从业人员正确的职业意识、职业观念和职业道德的形成。克服读书做官，追求升学率，社会意识中的非职业的等级观念等。
