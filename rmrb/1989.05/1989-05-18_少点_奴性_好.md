Title: Less "Slave Mentality" is Better

One day, I went to a certain department to handle some official business. I saw a friend who had just finished talking for a few minutes. Suddenly, an unfamiliar old man came in, requesting to solve some problem. He kept offering cigarettes, pleading earnestly for a long time. My friend, who was in charge of the "seal of approval," kept saying, "It's not possible. It's difficult."

The old man left after a while, and the "head" of that department brought in a middle-aged man, saying, "Just handle it for him." My friend then repeatedly said, "Okay, okay," and even courteously offered cigarettes to the old man...

I didn't want to criticize my friend. Scenes like this are not uncommon in real life. The problem lies in the "slave mentality": what should be done within one's duty, some people always need the "boss's" nod; what should be done naturally, some people like to look at the "background" and the "person"; what should be treated equally, some people prefer to differentiate levels and treat people with a "third eye." As for personal dignity and conscience, they are all tied to the feet of power, which is indeed a form of "self-slavery"!

Those with a slave mentality are born with a flattering bone: they bow and scrape to the "boss," act arrogantly towards common people; they detest others using power for personal gain, but when they have a bit of power, they do as they please; when asking for favors, they are not ashamed to bow and kneel, but when others ask them for favors, they raise their tails high; things that should be spoken out frankly, they instead shed tears and suppress themselves. Such behavior of currying favor is, whether driven by the "environment" or self-consciousness, contrary to our society's professional ethics! The saying "social customs are hard to correct" can it be unrelated to the spread of this "slave mentality"?

Opposing the "slave mentality" does not mean completely rejecting respect for superiors. Necessary and appropriate civilized etiquette should also be present. Shedding the "flattering bone" does not mean coldly rejecting human emotions; necessary and proper interpersonal relationships are indispensable for everyone. But if one is too "that way," once exposed, one is worthless! Being self-respecting without being arrogant, being self-respecting without being conceited, being upright, are traditional virtues of the Chinese nation. In my opinion, it is not wrong for young people to learn some ways of dealing with the world, but it is regrettable and sad to be infected with a slave mentality. It is better to be a person with less slave mentality!

### 少点“奴性”好

　　少点“奴性”好
    江西省宜春地区乡镇企业局  赵必福
    一天，我到某部门办公务，见到一位朋友刚谈几句，只见一位陌生老俵进来，要求解决什么问题。他一支接一支敬香烟，苦苦哀求了好一阵。我那位掌管“印权”的朋友，总是那句话：“不行呵。难办啦。”
    老俵出去不一会儿，该部门的“首脑”将一中年人领进来，说了句“给他办一下吧。”我这位老兄又连声“好的、好的”，还客客气气地给老俵递起烟来……
    我不想对这位朋友说三道四。诸如此类的镜头，现实生活中实不少见。问题所在，恐怕与奴性有关：本是职责内的事，有人却总离不开“上司”的眼色；本来顺理成章的事，有人喜欢看“来头”，看“对象”；本该一视同仁的，有人偏爱划等级“三只眼”待人。至于人格和良知，统统被这些系在权力脚下，实在是一种“自我奴役！”
    奴者生就一身媚骨：对“公司”点头哈腰，对平民装腔作势；对别人以权谋私深恶痛绝，自己有点芝麻权却为所欲为；求人时不耻鞠躬下跪，人求之则尾巴高高翘起；明明理当直言的，反而含泪委屈自己。如此趋炎附势，无论是“环境”所迫或是自我意识的，都与我们社会的职业道德相悖！所谓“世风难正”，能与这种“奴性媚骨”的传染无关？
    反对“奴性”，并非一概排斥尊上。必要而适度的文明礼义，也应有之。蜕弃“媚骨”，亦非冷绝人情，必要而正当的人际关系，谁也少不了。但为人太“那个”了，一旦被看破，一文不值！自尊而不自大，自重而不自负，正直为人，乃中华民族的传统美德。依我看，年轻人学点处世之道未尝不可，染上奴性媚骨堪叹自悲。做人，还是少点奴性好！
