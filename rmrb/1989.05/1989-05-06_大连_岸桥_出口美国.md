Dalian's "Shore Bridge" Exported to the United States

Our reporter informs that China's heavy machinery products have successfully entered the U.S. market for the first time. The shore-based container gantry crane (referred to as "shore bridge") manufactured by the Dalian Crane and Hoisting Machinery Factory for Charleston Port in South Carolina, USA, was recently loaded onto a ship at Dalian Port and set sail.

This "shore bridge" stands over 90 meters tall, has a forward-reaching arm of 44 meters, a span of 16 meters, and weighs over 700 tons, representing the advanced level of contemporary world technology. It was produced by the factory after winning a bid in an international tender held in May 1988, defeating 10 strong competitors from the United States, Japan, Finland, West Germany, and other countries.

　　大连“岸桥”出口美国
    本报讯  我国重型机械产品首次打进美国市场。大连起重机器厂为美国南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿港制造的岸边集装箱桥式起重机（简称“岸桥”），最近在大连港装船启运。
    这种“岸桥”，每台高９０余米，前伸臂长４４米，跨距１６米，重达７００余吨，具有当代世界先进水平。它是该厂在１９８８年５月的一次国际招标中，战胜美国、日本、芬兰、联邦德国等１０家世界强手而夺标的。
