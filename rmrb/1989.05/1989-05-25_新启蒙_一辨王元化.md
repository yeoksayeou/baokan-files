Title: On the "New Enlightenment"

Edition: 6

The "New Enlightenment" series has been published since October 1988, and although only four issues have been released in half a year, it has already attracted considerable attention. This series was launched in the context of a difficult publishing environment, where entertainment and consumer-oriented popular literature is rapidly displacing serious reading materials. The aim is to invigorate the academic atmosphere, advance theoretical research, and improve cultural quality. The series is not purely academic or evaluative but rather aims to explore, from a cultural perspective, theoretical issues of contemporary relevance that concern everyone. This editorial policy is stated in the "Afterword" of the first issue of the series, with the additional remark: "The life of theory lies in courage and sincerity."

The series is titled "New Enlightenment." Interestingly, no one has ever found anything wrong with the term "New Confucianism," but the moment "New Enlightenment" is mentioned, some people become highly sensitive, even questioning what we intend to do by proposing "New Enlightenment." Our small series, just a budding sprout, has received attention and support from many well-wishers, making us both grateful and humble. On the other hand, it has also raised some suspicions: What do you intend to do?

In fact, our goal is exactly what the series title suggests—New Enlightenment, or a new enlightenment movement. The enlightenment movement is essentially a movement for the liberation of thought. Democracy, science, the rule of law, humanism, reform, openness, and modernization—all these are linked to enlightenment. Is there anything to fear in that? China's reforms are now at a critical juncture. We firmly oppose the view that reforms have gone wrong and that we should retreat. The problems encountered in the reforms are not surprising; there is no straight path to reform. Problems arising from the reforms can only be solved through further reforms. The forces driving reform must be protected, and any attempt to reverse the reforms under any pretext is wrong. Reform is comprehensive: political reform, economic reform, and reform of ideas. Reform of ideas means updating ideas, liberating thought, and cultural enlightenment. Although our strength is limited, we will do our best to contribute in this area. In fact, the term "New Enlightenment" is not new. Before and during the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, some progressive theorists had already proposed it. At that time, many progressive publications discussed the issue of enlightenment. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Zhou Yang said that the Third Plenum was a second enlightenment movement following the May Fourth Movement. Calling the enlightenment movement after the Third Plenum the New Enlightenment simply means that the current enlightenment is not just a continuation of the May Fourth enlightenment but a deepening of it. The May Fourth enlightenment movement basically followed the 18th-century Western enlightenment thought. For example, at that time, _New Tide_ was an influential magazine similar to _New Youth_. According to the recollections of those involved, the magazine was named _New Tide_ to signify enlightenment, but the English translation used on the magazine mistakenly rendered Renaissance (文艺复兴) as Enlightenment (启蒙). Today, using the term New Enlightenment means not stopping at the level of 18th-century Western enlightenment thought. The two have a relationship of inheritance and commonality, such as opposing feudalism and affirming the value of the individual. However, today's enlightenment cannot, like the 18th-century enlightenment thinkers, regard "thinking reason" as the measure of all things. Today's enlightenment movement is based on the Third Plenum's proposal that practice is the criterion for truth, opposing personality cults, criticizing ultra-leftist trends, and opposing the "two whatevers." This is the main reason for calling this enlightenment movement "New Enlightenment" to distinguish it from the May Fourth enlightenment thought.

The view that completely excludes the spread of Marxism from the May Fourth New Culture Movement is naturally wrong. However, it should also be recognized that Marxism can only develop and grow under the condition of implementing the Hundred Flowers policy. The concept of "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" directly inherits the spirit of academic democracy and free discussion of the May Fourth era. If it is called "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending," it cannot be like the May Fourth era, which opposed the idea of establishing Confucianism as the sole authority. Hundred Schools of Thought means academic pluralism. In the past, "Hundred Schools of Thought Contending" was interpreted as having only the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, ultimately reducing it to one school, resulting in a situation where all horses are blind and causing Marxism itself to stagnate and become rigid. When we talk about the spread of Marxism in China, these valuable experiences that should be learned from are not to be avoided. Regarding issues such as human nature, subjectivity, humanism, self-awareness, and others closely related to the May Fourth enlightenment thought, how to re-examine and re-evaluate them from a Marxist perspective, rather than simply denying them, still has significant real-world implications today. In the years following the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the theoretical community has boldly expounded on the principle in the _Communist Manifesto_ that "the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all," and no longer regards the free development of the individual as individualism; it acknowledges the scientific interpretation in _Capital_ of "human general nature" and "human nature that changes in different historical periods," and no longer denies the existence of human nature; it cites Marx's views on German classical philosophers in proposing "self-awareness" and showing anti-feudal spirit, as well as what was said in _The German Ideology_: "The duty, mission, and task of any person is to fully develop all their abilities." Marx even said in his early works: "There should be no deity alongside human self-awareness." These issues have only just begun to be touched upon today and require further in-depth exploration. These are issues that were not addressed during the May Fourth era, were long ignored and misinterpreted afterward. But these issues are closely related to our reforms and opening up, and the realization of modernization. Without the elevation of human thought, thought liberation and renewal, it is impossible to complete the construction of socialist modernization. Thought cannot solve all problems, but if we reverse the argument and say that as long as the economy is developed, thought and consciousness will change accordingly, this view is also wrong. In the past, reformers or advocates of the Self-Strengthening Movement believed that changing China's backward appearance lay in "the tools can change, but the principles cannot," "Chinese learning as the essence, Western learning as the application," thus opposing the renewal of thought, precisely indicating that the Chinese mode of thinking (in the traditional sense) is not to solve everything with thought. For this reason, I believe that the New Enlightenment as a movement for the liberation of thought is important.

    “新启蒙”一辨
    王元化
    《新启蒙》论丛自1988年10月问世以来，虽仅出版四期，历时半载，却也颇引起各方面的注意。这一论丛是在目前出版界处境困难，娱乐性、消费性的通俗读物迅速挤走严肃读物的背景下创办的，打算为活跃学术空气，推进理论研究，提高文化质量做些工作。丛刊不是时评性的，也不是纯学术性的，而是从文化角度的高层次来探讨人人关心的具有现实意义的理论问题。这一办刊宗旨写在第一本《论丛》的《编后》中，并且加上了这样一层意思：“理论的生命在于勇敢和真诚”。
    论丛取名为“新启蒙”。奇怪的是，提“新儒学”从来没有人觉得有什么不对，可是一提“新启蒙”有人就十分敏感，竟说现在提出“新启蒙”不知是要干什么。我们这个小小的丛刊诞生不久，只是一棵刚出土的幼芽，受到了不少热心的朋友的重视和支持，这使我们既感激又惭愧。另一方面也引起了有些人的疑虑：你们要干什么？
    其实我们的宗旨就是论丛的名字——新启蒙，或者说是新的启蒙运动。启蒙运动也就是思想解放运动。民主、科学、法制、人道、改革、开放、现代化，这些都是和启蒙相联系的，难道有什么可怕吗？中国的改革现在面临一个关键的时刻，我们坚决反对那种埋怨改革搞坏了、想走回头路的观点。改革中遇到的这样那样的问题是不奇怪的，笔直的改革道路是没有的，改革中出现的问题只能在进一步改革中解决。改革的力量应当受到保护，以任何借口掀起改革回潮都是错误的。改革是全方位的：政治改革、经济改革，还有观念改革。观念改革就是观念更新，就是思想解放，就是文化启蒙。我们的力量尽管薄弱，但也要尽全力从这一方面作出贡献。其实，“新启蒙”的提法也并不新，早在抗日战争爆发前后，一些进步理论工作者就提出过了。当时不少进步书刊都就启蒙问题发表过意见。十一届三中全会以后，周扬就说过三中全会是继“五四”之后的再一次思想解放运动。把三中全会后的思想解放运动称为新启蒙，无非是说现在的思想启蒙不仅仅是继承五四的启蒙运动，而是更深化了。“五四”启蒙运动基本上是沿袭了18世纪西方的启蒙思想。例如当时的《新潮》是一份与《新青年》一样有影响的刊物。据当事人后来回忆，这份刊物定名《新潮》是取启蒙之义，但在刊物上所用的英文译名，却把R enaissance（文艺复兴）当作Enlightenment（启蒙）了。今天用新启蒙的意思，在于不再停留在18世纪西方启蒙思想的水平。两者有继承关系，也有共同性的方面，比如反对封建主义和肯定人的价值，等等。但是，今天的启蒙不能像18世纪启蒙思想家那样，把“思维着的悟性”当作衡量一切的尺度。今天的思想解放运动是建立在十一届三中全会所提出的实践是检验真理的标准、反对个人迷信、批判极“左”思潮、反对两个“凡是”的基础上的。这是把这次思想解放运动称作“新启蒙”，以区别于五四启蒙思想的主要原因。
    把马克思主义的传播完全排除在五四新文化运动之外的观点自然是不对的。但是，同时也应该认识到马克思主义只有在贯彻双百方针的条件下，才能发展壮大。百家争鸣这一提法直接继承了五四学术民主和自由讨论的精神。既然称为百家争鸣就不能像五四时代所反对的定儒家于一尊那样。百家也就是学术的多元化。过去曾经把百家争鸣解释为只有资产阶级和无产阶级两家，最后则归结为一家，结果不仅造成了万马齐暗的局面，也造成了马克思主义自身的停滞和僵化。我们谈到马克思主义在中国的传播，这些值得记取的经验是不容回避的。关于人性、主体性、人道主义、自我意识等等这些和五四启蒙思潮有着密切关联的问题，怎样用马克思主义观点进行再认识、再估价，而不是简单化地否定，恐怕直到今天仍具有重大现实意义。十一届三中全会以后这些年，理论界才理直气壮地阐述了《共产党宣言》中的“每个人的自由发展是一切人的自由发展的条件”这一原则，而不再把个人的自由发展作为个人主义；才承认《资本论》中关于“人的一般本性”和“在各个不同历史时期变化了的人性”的科学阐释，而不再否定人性的存在；才援引了马克思关于德国古典哲学家在提出“自我意识”中所显示的反封建精神，以及《德意志意识形态》中说的“任何人的职责、使命、任务就是全面地发展自己的一切能力”。马克思在早期甚至这样说：“不应该有任何神灵同人的自我意识并列。”这方面的问题今天刚刚开始接触，还有待进一步深入探讨，这是五四时没有涉及、五四后长期漠视、曲解的。但这些问题和我们的改革开放、实现现代化是密切相关的。没有人的提高，思想解放和更新，是不能完成社会主义现代化建设的。思想自然不可能解决一切问题，但如果反过来认为只要经济发达了，思想意识也就随着发生变化，这种看法也是不对的。过去洋务运动者或维新运动者认为改变中国的落后面貌在于“器可变，道不可变”、“中学为体，西学为用”，从而反对在思想上更新，正是说明中国思维模式（就传统意义上来说）并不是用思想去解决一切问题。正因为如此，我认为，作为思想解放运动的新启蒙是重要的。
