On May 7th, at the Shizuoka International Athletics Meet held in Hamamatsu, Japan, 22-year-old Chinese high jump athlete Jin Ling made a powerful leap, clearing the 1.97-meter bar and breaking the Asian women's high jump record of 1.96 meters. This result would have placed her 13th in the world rankings for the previous year.

Jin Ling was born in Dalian, Liaoning. At the age of 8, she entered an amateur sports school and initially trained in basketball and softball, but was dropped from both teams due to her lack of physical strength. In 1980, Chen Weiqian, a coach from the Beijing Sports University, went to Dalian for recruitment and discovered Jin Ling among the many applicants. Noticing her tall stature and long legs, Chen Weiqian saw her potential as a high jumper. To address Jin Ling's weakness in physical strength, Chen Weiqian employed various training methods to improve her overall physical condition. Jin Ling worked closely with her coach, training in running, jumping, and throwing to develop a balanced and coordinated physique.

In 1985, Jin Ling won the championship with a jump of 1.82 meters in the Sino-Japanese Youth Competition. At the same time, she was admitted to Beijing Sports University with excellent results and began receiving formal high jump training. Within a year, she achieved a height of 1.89 meters, ranking fourth in the national competition.

In early September 1988, at the Tianjin International Athletics Meet, she cleared 1.93 meters, defeating all competitors. At the Seoul Olympics, Jin Ling faced numerous strong opponents but performed normally, clearing a height of 1.90 meters. Standing at 1.83 meters tall, Jin Ling is not satisfied with her current achievements. Facing the upcoming Asian Athletics Championships and the 1990 11th Asian Games, she aims to reach even greater heights.

　　亚洲女飞人——金玲
    ５月７日，在日本滨松市举行的静冈国际田径赛上，中国２２岁的跳高选手金玲奋力一跳，跃过１．９７米的横竿，刷新了１．９６米的亚洲女子跳高纪录，这一成绩可排在去年世界第１３位。
    金玲出生在辽宁大连，８岁进业余体校，先后练过篮球、垒球，都因体力差而被除名。１９８０年，北京体院竞技体校的陈维勤教练去大连招生，从众多的考生中发现了身高腿长的金玲，认为这是个不可多得的跳高苗子。陈教练针对金玲体力差的弱点，采用多种训练方法，不断提高金玲的身体素质。金玲也同教练密切配合，跑、跳、投都练，全面协调发展。
    １９８５年，金玲在中日青年对抗赛上，以１．８２米获得冠军。同时，以优异的成绩考入北京体院，接受正规的跳高专项训练。一年的时间，她就以１．８９米名列全国第四位。
    １９８８年９月初在天津国际田径赛上，她以１．９３米力挫群芳。在汉城奥运会上，金玲面对众多名将，发挥正常，跳过１．９０米的高度。身高１．８３米的金玲并不满足，面对今年的亚洲田径锦标赛和１９９０年第１１届亚运会，她还要向更高的目标冲击。
