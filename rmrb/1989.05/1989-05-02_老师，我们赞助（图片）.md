		We, the students, would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our teachers for their unwavering dedication and hard work. In recognition of their contributions, we have decided to sponsor a special illustration by our talented artist, Zhong Zhenlin. This illustration is a symbol of our respect and appreciation for our teachers, who have guided us through our academic journeys with patience and wisdom.

		We hope that this small gesture will bring a smile to our teachers' faces and remind them of the impact they have on our lives. We are grateful for their efforts in shaping our minds and hearts, and we look forward to continuing to learn from them in the future.

		Thank you, teachers, for your dedication and inspiration. We are proud to sponsor this illustration in your honor.
