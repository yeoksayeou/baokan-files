Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 24th.

In the past two years of promoting the "smile service" in Guangzhou, which store has the best smiles? People often say that Southern Mansion has a "permanent smile." Customers feel that their smiles are sincere and warm.

However, in many places in China, smile service often fades quickly. How does Southern Mansion maintain its smiles? What is the secret?

Recently, the reporter visited the 71-year-old Southern Mansion. The secretary of the store, Wu Xihui, humorously said, "You ask about smiles, but I want to talk to you about complaints. The smiles at Southern Mansion come from complaints." Saying this, the secretary led us to a corner of the staff cafeteria, where a simple coffee room is set up for the staff. They give each staff member 8 yuan worth of coffee tickets for free every month. Salespeople can come here to rest for 15 minutes each day, and everyone can drink coffee and vent their complaints. Personal issues, family matters, store affairs, and even national issues can all be discussed freely here. Especially when giving feedback to the leaders, even if they bang the table and curse, the leaders listen attentively.

The deputy manager of Southern Mansion, Zheng Jianzhong, also introduced, "People are not made of wood. In real life, employees have many difficulties and grievances, such as housing, children's daycare, salaries, etc. Leaders listen to the complaints here, understand the situation, and then solve problems based on reality. Once the grievances are addressed, how can the smiles towards customers not last? As the saying goes, 'Preventing words is like preventing a river, blocking is not the solution.' Interestingly, now our coffee room has fewer complaints and more constructive suggestions."

Southern Mansion insists on respecting, understanding, and caring for people, which has enhanced cohesion. This is the spirit of the entire staff: "harmony, unity, creativity, and efficiency."

　　理解与关心带来创造与效率
    南方大厦治店有新招
    新华社广州５月２４日电  （记者安芸）在羊城近两年开展的微笑服务中，谁家笑得最好？人们称南方大厦是“永恒的微笑”。顾客感到他们笑得真诚、亲切。
    然而，在我国很多地方，微笑服务往往如昙花一现，南方大厦的微笑何以长久，其秘诀何在？
    前不久，记者走访了有７１年店龄的南方大厦。这家大型商店的书记伍锡辉风趣地说：“你问微笑，我却要同你谈牢骚，南方大厦的微笑来自牢骚。”说着，书记把我们带到职工食堂一角，这里是为职工设置的简易咖啡室，他们每月给职工免费发８元的咖啡票，售货员每天可来此小憩１５分钟，请大家喝着咖啡发牢骚。心事、家事、大厦的事，乃至国事，都可在此畅所欲言。特别是对单位领导提意见，拍了桌子骂了娘，领导也洗耳恭听。
    南方大厦经理助理郑建中还介绍说：“人非木头，现实生活中职工有很多困难和委屈，比如：住房、孩子入托、工资等等。领导在这里听了牢骚，体察到民情，然后从实际出发解决问题，顺了气，大家对顾客的微笑能不长久么？俗话说，防口如防川，堵是不行的。有意思的是，现在我们咖啡室里牢骚越来越少，建设性意见却越来越多。”
    南方大厦坚持尊重、理解、关心人，增强了凝聚力，这就是全体职工“和谐、统一、创造、效率”的企业精神。
