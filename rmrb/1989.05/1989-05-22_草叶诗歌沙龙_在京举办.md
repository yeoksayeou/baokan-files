The first "Grass Leaf Poetry Salon" was recently held at the People's Literature Publishing House, where participants discussed current issues in poetry creation.

Taiwanese poet Yang Ping introduced the situation of the poetry scene in Taiwan, comparing its prosperity to that of the Jian'an literature. He also recited his own poems. Tu An believed that since the "April Fifth" movement, mainland poetry has seen significant development, with a momentum even greater than the period following the May Fourth Movement. He also pointed out that some poetic language is overly verbose and lacks conciseness. Niu Han said that over the years, what influenced him the most was not books or any particular poet, but the temperament he developed in his childhood and youth. He warned that a poet must never forget the fundamental nature of humanity. Liu Zhanqiu felt that the state of poetry is good, with many magazines seeing a decline in subscriptions while *Poetry Magazine* remains above 100,000, making it the world's top poetry magazine in terms of circulation. Yang Kuanghan said that writing poetry is a product of the free state of life, a free expression of life, but in reality, this has not been achieved. He also said that only by caring for the fundamental destiny of humanity can one write good poetry. Mo Wenzheng said that some young people's works are full of impact and surprising, but the critical work has not kept up, and it is necessary to promote the appreciation of poetry. Other speakers included Liu Qian and Mi Si.

　　“草叶诗歌沙龙”在京举办
    本报讯  首届“草叶诗歌沙龙”最近在人民文学出版社举办，参加者就当前诗歌创作问题展开清谈。
    台湾诗人杨平介绍了台湾诗坛情况，认为其繁荣情形可与建安文学相比，他还朗诵了自己的诗作；屠岸认为，大陆的新诗“四五”运动以来有很大的发展，其势头比“五四”之后的时期更为深广，他还指出，有的诗语言过于芜杂拖沓、不精炼；牛汉说，几十年来影响自己最大的不是书也不是哪位诗人，而是童年、少年时形成的气质，他告诫一个诗人千万不能忘记人性的根本；刘湛秋觉得诗的情况很好，许多刊物订数下降而《诗刊》仍在十万份以上，为世界诗刊印数第一；杨匡汉说，写诗是生命的生理的自由状态下的产物，应是生命的自由流露，但实际上并未达到，他还说，只有从人类根本命运的终局关怀上才能写出好诗；莫文征说，有的年轻人的作品富有冲击力，令人吃惊，但评论工作却未能跟上，应提倡诗歌的鉴赏；发言的还有刘虔、米思及等。
