Column: Suggestions and Demands

The increasing number of contract disputes in township enterprises should be taken seriously. In recent years, some places have seen a rising trend in economic contract disputes among township enterprises. Our county recently inspected 943 enterprises and 11,300 economic contracts, finding 2,700 contract disputes, with 90% involving township enterprises. The amount of overdue receivables reached 70 million yuan, seriously hindering the development of township enterprises.

The causes of economic contract disputes in township enterprises are as follows: First, some township enterprises' legal representatives and supply and marketing personnel lack legal knowledge and do not adhere to the law, thus they cannot properly use legal means in economic contract dealings. Second, some township enterprises sign economic contracts hastily and carelessly. Some have incomplete subjects, illegal content, unclear responsibilities, vague clauses, and incomplete procedures. Third, some township enterprises do not pay attention to contract management, have no designated person in charge, have chaotic systems, and do not properly manage blank contract papers with official seals, leading to the widespread misuse of blank contracts. Fourth, some lawless elements take advantage of township enterprises' insufficient tasks, material shortages, technological backwardness, and chaotic management systems, pretending to be "experts" and deceiving many township enterprises, causing significant losses. Fifth, contract management agencies are weak, with insufficient personnel and low quality, making it difficult to carry out regular supervision and management work.

It is suggested that relevant departments seriously address the legal education of township enterprises, genuinely improve the legal awareness of township enterprises' legal representatives and supply and marketing personnel. Banks, taxation, and auditing departments should work closely together, strengthen the supervision and inspection of economic contracts in township enterprises, promptly handle illegal contracts, and protect the legal rights of enterprises.

### 乡镇企业合同纠纷增多应引起重视

　　乡镇企业合同纠纷增多应引起重视
    近几年来，一些地方的乡镇企业经济合同纠纷呈上升趋势。我县最近检查了９４３家企业的１１３００份经济合同，发现有合同纠纷的２７００起，其中乡镇企业合同纠纷占９０％，应收未收回款达７０００万元，严重地妨碍了乡镇企业的发展。
    造成乡镇企业经济合同纠纷的原因是：一、一些乡镇企业的法定代表人和供销业务人员不懂法、不守法，因而在经济合同交往中，不能正确运用法律手段。二、一些乡镇企业在签订经济合同中，草率马虎，有的主体不完整，有的内容不合法，有的责任不明确，有的条款不具体，有的手续不完备等。三、一部分乡镇企业不重视合同管理，无专人负责，制度混乱，盖有公章的空白合同纸无人保管，造成空白合同纸满天飞。四、少数不法分子趁乡镇企业任务不足，原材料紧缺，技术落后，管理制度混乱之机，打着“能人”的幌子到处招摇撞骗，使不少乡镇企业上当受骗，遭受损失。五、合同管理机关力量薄弱，人员的数量和素质还不适应繁重的管理任务，难以开展经常性的监督管理工作。
    建议有关部门认真抓好乡镇企业的普法教育，切实提高乡镇企业法定代表人和供销业务人员的法制观念；银行、税务、审计等部门要密切配合，加强对乡镇企业经济合同的监督检查，发现违法合同应及时查处，维护企业的合法权益。
