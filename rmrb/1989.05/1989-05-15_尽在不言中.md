When the roar of the airplane engine suddenly changed and the wheels rapidly rolled on the runway of the capital airport, I abruptly awoke from my daze, realizing my own existence. The dream-like three-month medical tour was over, and stepping off the airplane stairs was like returning from space to earth. The warm breeze carried the faint scent of jasmine, making one want to take deep breaths. The soft morning sun bathed the distant mountains, green trees, and lawns in a hazy glow, casting an ethereal hue over everything. The buildings in the distance, bathed in the glow of the rainbow, seemed like a mirage...

This was a serene, delicate beauty, charming yet elegant, mysterious yet full of life, in stark contrast to the rugged mountains and raging rivers of the medical team's base.

Boarding the civil aviation bus, weaving through the bustling city, my mind still flashed back to the scene of yesterday's farewell: the hazy mountains, the dense forest with hidden thatched huts, and the crowd rushing along the winding mountain path to see us off. The sky was drizzling with silent rain, and the mountain people, wearing bamboo hats, stood in groups on the slope, gazing at the car that was taking us away like pilgrims. The mountain people were simple and honest, with no elaborate farewell words. As the car started, what caught my eye was the countless arms waving vigorously and the pairs of expectant eyes. What moved my heart was the suppressed sobs from the crowd. My landlady, at that moment, with lightning speed, threw a heavy package of mountain goods into my arms again. Her twin daughters danced and gestured to me, signaling that I must accept it. Their bright eyes sparkled with childish passion, and they chased after the car in the dust for a long time...

At that moment, my eyes welled up, and my long-dormant heart was stirred. A deep sadness and guilt gripped me. In three months of living together, I had only used the convenience of staying with them to treat their family's minor illnesses a few times and tried acupuncture on their twin daughters who were born deaf-mute, with little effect, but they treated me like a god. Among the medical team members, almost everyone had a touching story. These people living in the deep mountains, each with a crystal-clear heart! My vague consciousness suddenly became clear, making me deeply feel the sacred duty of a medical worker.

Suppressing the surge of thoughts, I stepped into the long-missed home. I saw the bright room and familiar things. No one rushed to me, no one tightly held my delicate hand, and no one gave me affectionate caresses. Chinese people are good at being reserved and hiding their true feelings. My daughter, perhaps influenced by Confucius, hid in the corner, smiling at me with her mouth closed. My usually taciturn mother, hearing that I hadn't had breakfast, hurried into the kitchen and, in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, cooked a fragrant bowl of noodle soup. I was familiar with the process of making the soup, but its exquisite feature was that it combined the colors of the rainbow: yellow egg flowers, green melon slices, red tomatoes, black seaweed, white fine noodles, then drizzled with a few drops of sesame oil, sprinkled with a pinch of MSG, mixed well, and served in a blue-flowered fine porcelain bowl. Holding it in my hand, it was a mouth-watering delicacy, and the silent love was all in the steaming bowl.

Before the soup was finished, I had already told half the story of the mute family. My daughter seemed to be deeply moved, her arms around my neck loosened, and her eyes filled with tears, begging me to bring the two mute girls to treat their illness. Childhood, perhaps childhood is the purest, truest, and most flawless in the world!

I held my daughter in my arms, gently stroking her soft hair. I wanted to tell her that reality is full of hardships, and we have many impoverished areas that need support and transformation; I also wanted to tell her that there are still many blank spots in medicine and diseases that need to be conquered by humanity; both you and I lost our father to the hateful cancer; I wanted to tell her more about the meaning of life and the importance of knowledge... There was so much I wanted to say, but I didn't say anything. My daughter is still young, and she wouldn't understand profound truths, so I'll leave it for later.

However, the endless thoughts kept knocking on my heart, so I could only turn the pent-up feelings in my heart into round, elegant Chinese characters. This is the only remedy that can bring me peace.

　　尽在不言中
    鹿素兰
    当飞机的发动机轰鸣突然变调，轮子快速地在首都机场的跑道上滑行时，我蓦地从怔忡中惊醒，意识到自己的存在。梦一般的三个月巡回医疗的任务结束了，步下飞机的舷梯犹如从太空返回人间。拂面而来的是温煦的暖风挟裹着缕缕米兰的幽香，使人忍不住要贪婪地深吸。熹微的朝阳洒在极目可见的远山、绿树、草坪上，给万物罩上一层扑朔迷离的色彩，正前方虹光辉映下的一片楼群云蒸霞蔚，恍如海市蜃楼……
    这是一种恬静、细腻的美，俏丽中泛着俊逸，迷蒙中透出生机，和医疗队驻地的崇山峻岭，危涯湍流形成鲜明的对照。
    登上民航班车，穿梭于车水马龙的闹市，脑际闪现的依旧是昨日告别时的画面：迷蒙的群山，茂密丛林中若隐若现的茅舍，踏着逶迤山路匆匆赶来送行的人流。天，飘着无声的细雨，戴着斗笠的山民们三五成群站在斜坡，朝圣般地看接我们走的汽车。山民们是淳朴的，没有更多的饶有韵味儿的告别语，车开的一瞬映入眼帘的是无数只用力挥动的臂膀和一双双期待的目光，撼人心灵的是人群里飘出的压抑住的呜咽。我的房东大嫂就在那一瞬以迅雷之速再次将那包沉甸甸的山货掷入我的怀中，她的一对孪生女儿手舞足蹈地向我打着“必须收下”的哑语，明亮的眼眸里闪烁着童稚的激情，在车后扬起的尘埃中她们追逐了很久……
    当时，我的眼眶湿润了，久已沉寂的心被激荡着，一种深沉的悲哀和差惭紧紧地攫住我。三个月的相处，我不过利用居住之便为她一家诊过几次小病，为她双胞女儿的先天聋哑尝试性地扎过针灸，疗效也不显著，却被他们全家奉若神明。而医疗队的成员中，几乎每人都有一段感人肺腑的故事。这些蛰居深山的乡亲们，人人怀揣一颗晶莹剔透的心！懵懂的意识就在那一刻豁然开朗，使我深刻感受到一个医务工作者肩负的神圣天职。　  按捺着涌上心头的千思万绪迈进了久违的家门，我又看到了明亮的房间和熟悉的一切。没人向我扑来，没人紧握我纤弱的手，也没人赐给我亲昵的爱抚。中国人惯会含蓄，且极善掩饰自己的真情。女儿大约也受了孔夫子的熏陶，躲在墙角抿着嘴朝我眯眯地笑着，一向不苟言谈的母亲闻我未进早餐，急匆匆钻进厨房，一盏茶的功夫便烹制出一碗喷香的汤面。制汤面的程序我熟悉，而它的绝妙在于集五颜六色之大成：黄的是蛋花，绿的是瓜片，红的是番茄，黑的是紫菜，白的是精细的龙须面，之后淋几滴香油，捏一撮味精，揽匀了盛在蓝花细瓷碗里，捧在手中便是令人垂涎的佳肴，而那无言的情和爱均融进冒着腾腾热气的碗里了。
    汤未喝完，哑女一家的故事已讲了大半，女儿看来动了真情，勾住我脖子的手松开，眼泪汪汪地恳求我把两个哑女接来治病。童心，人世间大约童心是最纯、最真、最无暇的吧！
    我把女儿揽在怀里，轻轻抚摸她柔软的头发。我本想告诉她，现实充满了艰辛，我们有不少贫困地区需要扶持和改造；我还想告诉她，医学上的空白点和需要人类征服的病症还很多，你我的父亲都是被可恨的癌症夺走性命的；我想再给她讲讲人生的意义，学识的重要……想讲的很多，但我什么也没讲，女儿还小，深奥的道理她听不懂，还是留待以后吧。
    然而，萦绕不绝的思绪无数次撞击着心扉，于是我只好把郁积胸中的一切演绎成一个个浑圆的、飘逸的汉字，这是唯一能令我心安的良药。
