The students of the 1985 class of the Central Academy of Drama's Acting Department have achieved significant results by applying their theoretical knowledge to performance practice. Over their four years of study, the students of this class have played leading roles and important parts in 20 films and 30 television dramas.

During their four years of study, the 1985 Acting Class systematically learned dramatic theory, acting theory and techniques, as well as stage language, physical expression, and vocal techniques. They have staged numerous dramatic excerpts and teaching performances, including "Red Room, White Room, Black Room," "Men on the Horizon," "Little Wild Boar," and "The Story of Irkutsk." Throughout their studies, all the students participated in the filming of movies and television shows, playing leading roles or important parts in 20 films such as "Red Sorghum," "The Assassin's Love," "The Price of Madness," and "Summer's Expectation," and nearly 30 television dramas such as "Snow Island," "Floating Grass," and "Household Without Men."

This summer, the 1985 Acting Class students will enter their workplaces. Before graduation, they will screen 12 films as part of their internship report and will perform the two-act play "The Gold Rush Ship" and the large-scale drama "Moonlit Wasteland—Wasteland and Man" as their graduation performances for the audience.
