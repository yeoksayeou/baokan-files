Today, over a million people from various sectors in Beijing took to the streets, gathering at Tiananmen Square, to hold a massive march in support of the students who are on a hunger strike and petitioning the government. The students' hunger strike has entered its fifth day. At the scene, reporters saw ambulances coming and going, with urgent calls echoing, each one tugging at the heartstrings. The square is hot during the day and cold at night. Although the students are resolute, their situation is dire, and their lives are in danger, which has drawn great concern from all sectors of society.

Starting from this morning, the crowds supporting the students, carrying banners and shouting slogans, began to enter Chang'an Street. Among the endless stream of people, in addition to students, teachers, and staff from Beijing's colleges and universities, and teachers from Beijing's primary and secondary schools, the presence of workers was particularly notable. Workers from Beijing Nuclear Instrument Factory, Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant, Beijing Crane Machinery Factory, Beijing Jeep Automobile Limited Company, Beijing Heavy Machinery Factory, Beijing First Machine Tool Plant, Beijing Silk Corporation, Beijing Transformer Factory, Beijing Sanlu Factory, and Shougang, among other large and medium-sized enterprises, carried banners with slogans such as "Save the Children" and "Eliminate Corruption, Overthrow Officials' Privileges," to show their support.

The procession of medical workers from the capital, dressed in white coats, arrived. Among them were Beijing Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing Hospital, Chaoyang Red Cross Hospital, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing Cancer Hospital, and others. Leading the way, hand in hand, were Hou Jianguo, a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a first-level professor, and Zhao Minjun. Their banner read: "Strongly demand that the government immediately agree to the students' three demands" and "Save the people and save the nation."

Democrats carrying banners such as "Immediate Dialogue, No Time to Waste" and "Demanding Democracy Does Not Harm the Nation's Image" marched across the square, shouting slogans. When the capital's Buddhist delegation, carrying the banner "Compassion and Love for All," passed by, applause erupted from all around.

When the procession from the People's Bank of China passed by the East Gate of the Great Hall of the People, they repeatedly shouted, "No loans for officials' privileges!" and "Freeze officials' accounts!" The customs delegation shouted, "Officials' smuggling, ironclad evidence!" and was warmly welcomed by the surrounding students and crowds with applause.

Today's march included employees from state organs, central government organs, as well as financial, transportation, telecommunications, and news publishing systems. There were also civilian personnel from the People's Liberation Army.

Over a thousand employees from this newspaper also participated in the march today, with some senior editors and reporters in their sixties leading the way.

In the march, reporters saw banners from institutions and units in Tianjin, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Changsha, Xi'an, and Sichuan.

A cadre from Shandong Provincial Directly Affiliated Organs initially had some reservations about the students' actions. Today, with tears in his eyes, he told reporters, "Seeing the students' actions and the support from so many residents of the capital, I feel reassured." When asked about his thoughts on Zhao Ziyang's written speech, he said, "Comrade Ziyang said that the Party and the government will never 'settle accounts later.' I am somewhat reassured. However, what active measures will the Party and the government take to reassure the students and the people of the nation? I hope the Central Committee makes a decision soon, the faster the better."

Reporters saw that among the dense crowd, many citizens provided tea, water, and cold drinks for the marchers. At the fundraising site near the southwest entrance of the square, citizens generously donated. A woman in her forties walked up to the students and said, "You must also take care of yourselves!"

Today's march was relatively orderly. Student patrol teams guided the crowds at various sections and established marching rules. Over 700 students from the China Police University voluntarily came to the square in the early hours of May 18th to assist the students in maintaining order, ensuring the smooth passage of ambulances from the southeast entrance of the square to Qianmen. However, due to the large number of people marching and watching in the square today, some roads were blocked.

　　首都各界百余万人游行  声援绝食请愿的大学生    
    强烈要求立即对话救人救国
    本报北京５月１７日讯  今天，北京各界百余万人走上街头，汇集天安门广场，举行声势浩大的游行，声援在天安门广场绝食请愿的学生。
    学生绝食请愿已进入第５天。记者在现场看到，救护车进进出出，尖厉的呼叫不绝于耳，声声揪心。广场白天热，夜里冷。学生虽然意志坚定，但处境艰难，生命危急，引起社会各界极大的关注。
    从上午开始，声援学生的队伍打着横幅，喊着口号，陆续走进长安街。在不尽的人流中，除了首都高等院校的学生、教职工，北京市中小学教师的队伍之外，工人的队伍惹人注目。北京核仪器厂、北京汽车制造厂、北京起重机器厂、北京吉普汽车有限公司、北京重型机械厂、北京第一机床厂、北京丝绸总厂、北京变压器厂、北京三露厂及首钢等大中型企业的部分工人，举着“救救孩子”、“铲除腐败，打倒官倒”等横幅标语，前来声援。
    穿着白大褂的首都医务工作者的队伍走来了，他们中有协和医院、北京医院、朝阳红十字医院、中日友好医院、北京肿瘤医院……手挽手走在最前面的，有全国政协委员、一级教授侯建群和赵敏顺。他们的横幅是：“强烈要求政府立即答应学生三点要求”“救人更要救国”。
    举着“立即对话，刻不容缓”、“求民主无损国家形象”等醒目横幅的民主党派人士，高呼口号走过广场。当打着“慈悲为怀爱人如己”的首都佛教徒慰问队走过来的时候，四周响起了热烈的掌声。
    中国人民银行总行的游行队伍经过人民大会堂东门时，不断呼喊：“不给官倒贷款！”“冻结官倒帐户！”海关总署的声援队伍喊道：“官倒走私，铁证如山！”受到周围学生、群众热烈鼓掌欢迎。
    在今天的游行队伍中，有国家机关、中直机关以及金融、交通、电信、新闻出版等系统的职工，还有人民解放军的文职人员。
    本报一千多名职工今天也参加了游行，走在前面的是，在新闻界有相当声望的一些年已花甲的高级编辑记者。
    在游行队伍中，记者看到来自天津、河北、黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、长沙、西安、四川一些院校和单位的横幅。
    来自山东省直属机关的一位干部起初对学生们的行动还有些不太理解，今天，他眼含泪水对记者说：“看到学生们的行动，受到首都那么多居民的声援和支持，我心里就踏实了。”当记者问及对赵紫阳的书面谈话有何感想时，他说：“紫阳同志说党和政府绝不会‘秋后算账’，我有些放心了。但是，党和政府采取什么积极措施，让学生放心，让全国人民放心，希望中央早下决心，越快越好。”
    记者看到，在密集的人群中，有许多市民群众为游行队伍送茶送水送冷饮。在广场西南口募捐处，市民们纷纷解囊，一位４０多岁的妇女走上前去对学生说：“你们也要保重自己啊！”
    今天游行秩序比较好，学生纠察队在各个路段进行疏导，并规定了游行规则。中国警官大学的７００多名学生１８日凌晨自发来到广场协助学生维持秩序，保证了从广场东南口至前门之间救护车道的畅通无阻。但是，由于今天广场上游行和围观的人过多，一些地方道路被堵塞。
