Cigarette production in China is shifting towards safer types. Today, Ma Wenming, the head of tobacco production at the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, spoke to our reporters about this new measure in response to the global anti-smoking movement.

The official stated: "Currently, the tar content of the 2,487 registered cigarette brands in China has been controlled to below 25 milligrams per cigarette. The number of cigarette varieties that reduce or inhibit tar and nicotine content is increasing year by year. Mixed-type cigarettes have increased from 1.31 million cartons in 1987 to 1.707 million cartons in 1988. Cigarettes with filters that can remove 2-3 milligrams of tar per cigarette have increased from 8 million cartons in 1987 to 11 million cartons in 1988. This year, the production and variety of these cigarettes will continue to increase.

At the same time, strict controls will be imposed on high-tar and other inferior cigarettes. The reason why the national cigarette production in the first four months of this year decreased by 2.3% compared to the same period last year is that the proportion of low-grade cigarettes has been reduced. In addition, the State Council has issued a document this year to resolutely shut down more than 40 unplanned cigarette factories, most of which do not meet the standards in terms of technology and quality.

To reduce the harmful components of cigarettes and lower the tar content, the national tobacco department has taken measures such as tobacco leaf expansion, perforated paper, high-permeability cigarette paper, formula adjustments, and other active measures.

So far, China's cigarette production still faces considerable difficulties. Filters (filter tips) are entirely dependent on imports, and only one-third of the total cigarette production can be guaranteed. Domestically produced composite filters and polypropylene filters are also substandard, with difficulties in technological transformation and equipment matching.

### 烟草部门调整产品结构  香烟生产正转向安全型

　　烟草部门调整产品结构
    香烟生产正转向安全型
    本报北京５月２９日讯  我国香烟生产正朝安全型方向转变。今天，国家烟草专卖局烟草生产负责人马文明向笔者谈了我国呼应全球反吸烟运动的这项新措施。
    这位负责人说：“目前，我国已登记注册的２４８７种牌号的香烟的含焦油量，已经基本控制在２５毫克／（每支）以下。能够减少、抑制焦油含量或尼古丁的香烟品种，正在逐年增加；混合型香烟已由１９８７年的１３１万箱，增加到１９８８年的１７０．７万箱；每支能滤掉２—３毫克焦油含量的过滤嘴香烟已由１９８７年的８００万箱，增加到１９８８年的１１００万箱。今年，这些香烟的产量及品种将继续增加。
    与此同时，对于那些高焦油等劣质香烟，则要严格控制。今年１至４月，全国香烟产量之所以比去年同期下降２．３％，关键是压低了低等烟所占的比例。另外，今年，国务院已经下文，要坚决关掉４０多家计划外烟厂，这些厂家多半在工艺和质量上都不过关。
    为了减少香烟有害成分，降低焦油含量，国家烟草部门采取了烟丝膨胀、水松纸打孔、高透气度卷烟纸、配方上等工艺改造和其它积极措施。
    到目前为止，我国香烟生产仍有相当难处，丝束（过滤嘴）全靠进口，且只能保障香烟总产的１／３。自制的复合嘴、聚丙烯嘴也不过关，技术改造、设备配套上都有困难。
