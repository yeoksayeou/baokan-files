The secretary of the Zhangzhou Municipal Party Committee, Zhang Wenliang, served for four years and built three "Secretary's Mansions," squandering more than 200,000 yuan of public funds. Today, this newspaper exposes this fact.

To govern with integrity and eliminate corruption is the requirement of the Party and the government, and it is also the call of the people. Indeed, in matters of housing, overseas trips, banquets, gifts, and the placement of children and spouses, one can see whether a leading cadre is honest and upright or abuses power for personal gain. The central authorities have repeatedly emphasized that Party and government cadres must be clean, with both spirit and specific regulations, such as the size and standards of housing, all of which are clearly stipulated. All of these, Zhang Wenliang, as the secretary of the municipal Party committee, would not have been unaware of. However, he did not heed the spirit of the central authorities, did not implement the regulations of the State Council, and under the eyes of the municipal Party committee, the municipal government, and the people of the entire city, he successively built one "Secretary's Mansion" after another. No matter how many "achievements" he has, on this point alone, people have reason to doubt that his call for Party members and the masses in Zhangzhou to "strive hard" and to "tighten their belts for a few years" will have any real effect.

Power must be supervised and constrained; power without supervision will inevitably lead to corruption. As a leading cadre, no matter how high the position or how great the power, one cannot be without supervision. One must be supervised by superiors and the central authorities, as well as by subordinates and the masses, and by public opinion. To ensure cleanliness, it is not enough to rely on the awareness of the leaders themselves; it is also unreliable. Effective supervision must be implemented. Zhang Wenliang's disciplinary violations once again prove this point.

The leading organs of the CPC Fujian Provincial Committee have already stated that they will seriously handle Zhang Wenliang's problem. If such obvious disciplinary violations are not severely punished, the prestige of the Party and the government will be seriously affected, and it will not be possible to effectively lead the masses in reform and in the Four Modernizations. If other places and units discover figures like Zhang Wenliang, they should resolutely investigate and deal with each one found. This is a necessary measure for Party and government organs to maintain cleanliness and is the most powerful response to the people's call to eliminate corruption.

　　一定要消除腐败现象
    本报评论员
    漳州市委书记张文良任职４年，盖了３幢“书记楼”，挥霍公款２０多万元。今天，本报揭露了这一事实。
    为政要清廉，腐败要消除，这是党和政府的要求，也是人民群众的呼声。确实，在住房、出国、请客送礼以及孩子老婆的安排等方面，都可以看出一个领导干部是廉洁奉公还是以权谋私的。中央一再强调党政干部要廉洁，既有精神，又有具体规定，如住房面积多大，规格多高，规定都是明确的。所有这些，张文良作为市委书记不会不知道，可是，他不听中央的精神，不执行国务院的规定，在市委、市政府和全市人民的眼皮底下，先后盖起了一幢又一幢“书记楼”。不管他有多少“政绩”，仅凭这一点，人们有理由怀疑，他在漳州市号召党员和群众去“艰苦奋斗”，去“过几年紧日子”，能有什么实际效果。
    对权力必须要有监督，有制约，不受监督的权力必然产生腐败。作为一个领导干部，不管地位多高，权力多大，都不能不受监督，既要受上级、中央的监督，还要受下级、群众的监督，受舆论的监督。要保证廉洁，光靠领导者个人的觉悟是不够的，也是靠不住的，还必须实行有效的监督。张文良的违纪行为再次说明了这一点。
    中共福建省委领导机关已经表示要严肃处理张文良的问题。对这种明显的违纪行为如果不严加制裁，党和政府的威信就会受到严重的影响，就不可能卓有成效地带领群众搞改革，干四化。其他地方和单位如果发现张文良这类人物，发现一个就坚决查处一个，这是党政机关保持廉洁的必要措施，也是对人民消除腐败的呼声的最有力的回答。
