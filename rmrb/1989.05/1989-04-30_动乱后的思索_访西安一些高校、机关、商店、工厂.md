The turmoil that occurred on April 22 in Xi'an, unprecedented since the founding of the People's Republic, has now subsided. In this turmoil, hundreds of civilians, armed police officers, and public security personnel were injured. Ten vehicles were burned, and 14 shops were looted, causing losses amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan.

This recent calamity has prompted deep reflection among the people.

Today, reporters once again visited the Tian Tian Clothing Store, which was ransacked on April 22. Once bustling with customers, the store is now closed, with wooden boards nailed over the windows. The store manager, Li Yuening, recounted to reporters the ordeal of the looters. That day, after a group of rioters were driven out of the square by armed police and public security personnel after vandalizing the west gate of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, the provincial court, and the provincial procuratorate, they continued their rampage. At 9:30 PM, this group of rioters smashed the store's door and windows, rushed into the store, and looted all the high-end clothing such as suits, leather jackets, and wool sweaters. They also destroyed the shelves, counters, and copying machines. At the time, the 65-year-old worker Cow ZhiJie, who was guarding the store, was terrified. Li Yuening said, "I have experienced the Cultural Revolution and know the bitterness of turmoil. We had just enjoyed a few good years, and now such things have happened again, which is heartbreaking. Our store has developed gradually in the tide of reform. Without a stable and united environment and reform and opening up, there would be no Tian Tian Clothing Store. This time, we suffered a loss of over 210,000 yuan. China cannot afford more chaos."

After news of the Tian Tian Clothing Store being ransacked spread, colleagues from Shanghai, Lanzhou, and Kunming expressed concern and offered assistance. On April 24, the Shanghai Patriotic Management Department donated goods worth 280,000 yuan without compensation, and some units also donated money. This clothing store is now rushing to repair the damage and aims to reopen by May 1.

Reporters also visited the Qing'an Aerospace Equipment Company located in the western suburbs. During the Cultural Revolution, this company was notorious for its "armed struggles," and the workers suffered greatly from the turmoil. On April 22, some workers of this company witnessed the scene of lawless elements vandalizing and looting on the square. The deputy manager and some cadres and workers of this company said, "China has been delayed too much by turmoil. China cannot afford more chaos!"

Two days after the turmoil, 507 students from 10 universities, including Northwest University and Northwest Industrial University, visited the New City Square and the courtyard of the provincial court and procuratorate on the west side of the provincial government, which were severely damaged. They saw the destruction on the scene and felt heavy-hearted. Some students from Xi'an University of Metallurgy and Xi'an Institute of Mining said, "It's too tragic! Some said, "Society is complex, and sometimes we think too simply." In recent days, reporters visited Xi'an Jiaotong University, Northwest University, and Northwest Industrial University. These schools have gradually returned to normal. Most students are continuing their normal studies. A student from the Computer Science Department of Northwest University said, "We care about national affairs and reform, and our feelings should be understood, but some bad elements took the opportunity to vandalize and loot, which is unacceptable. This is not conducive to national stability and does not conform to our wishes. We hope the country will severely punish these people according to law. At that time, we thought too simply and did not expect such a big incident. We hope the country will be stable and united, and the reform will continue to deepen. At the same time, we also hope the government will improve its work, reduce mistakes, and fight corruption to create better conditions for social development."

Some teachers from the schools and relevant department heads, after reviewing their experiences over the past few days, analyzed that today's young people were mostly born at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution and grew up in the era of reform and opening up. They do not have a personal experience of the harm caused by turmoil and the hard-won stable and united situation. They are eager for the country's reform and progress, for science and democracy, but they lack a scientific understanding of the difficulties of reform and the achievements of the past decade of reform. They do not understand that under the current conditions in China, it is not possible to completely copy the Western-style democracy. Moreover, our ideological and political work is not adapted to the new situation in many aspects, resulting in some things that should not have happened. We must also seriously summarize our experiences and lessons.

Reporters also visited some representatives attending the second session of the seventh Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress regarding the "April 22" incident. They believe that in the past decade of reform, we have achieved great success, but there have also been many mistakes and many corrupt phenomena. All levels of leading cadres should reflect on this incident and think about their image in the minds of the masses. For the existing corrupt phenomena, the government must take practical measures to truly solve the problems. They hope that all levels of leading cadres will often communicate with workers, peasants, and students, listen to their opinions, and do a good job.

　　动乱后的思索   
    ——访西安一些高校、机关、商店、工厂
    新华社记者  杨延礼  王世焕  彭少阳  苏民生
    西安建国以来从未发生过的“４·２２”动乱已经平息。
    在这场动乱中，有数百名群众、武警战士和公安人员受伤，１０辆汽车被烧毁，１４家商店被砸抢，损失达数百万元。
    这场刚刚过去的劫难，引起人们的思索。
    今天，记者又一次来到４月２２日被洗劫一空的天天服装店，昔日这里门庭若市，而今店门关闭，橱窗上钉满了三合板。这个店的经理李跃宁向记者叙说了暴徒们洗劫商店的经过。那天，一伙暴徒在打砸抢烧陕西省政府西门、省法院、省检察院被武警部队和公安人员驱赶出广场后，一路继续打砸抢。晚９时半，这伙暴徒砸碎了店门、橱窗，冲进了店堂，把店里的西装、皮夹克、羊毛衫等高档服装抢个精光，把货架、柜台、复印机等捣个稀巴烂。当时，守在店堂里的６５岁的老职工牛志杰吓懵了。李跃宁说：“我是从‘文革’中过来的，深知动乱之苦。刚过了几年好日子，现在又出现了这样的事，令人痛心。我们店是在改革的大潮中逐步发展起来的。没有安定团结的环境，没有改革开放，就没有我们天天服装店。这一次，我们一下子就损失了２１万多元。中国不能再乱了。”
    天天服装店被砸的消息传开后，上海、兰州、昆明等地的同行很关切，纷纷来电慰问，伸出援助之手。上海爱国经营部４月２４日无偿支援了价值２．８万元的商品，还有一些单位捐了款。这家服装店正在加紧修复，争取“五一”重新开张。
    记者还访问了位于西郊的庆安宇航设备公司。这个公司在“文革”中曾以“武斗”闻名全市，职工深受动乱之苦。４月２２日，这个公司有的职工在广场目击了不法之徒打砸抢烧的情景。这家公司的副经理和一些干部职工说，中国被动乱耽误的时间太多了，中国不能再乱了！
    动乱后两天，西北大学、西北工业大学等１０所院校的５０７名学生来到新城广场和省政府西侧遭到严重破坏的省法院、省检察院的院子。他们看了现场的破坏情况，心情沉重。西安冶金建筑学院和西安矿业学院的一些学生痛心地说，太惨了！有的说，社会是复杂的，我们考虑问题有时太简单了。记者近日访问了西安交通大学、西北大学、西北工业大学。这些学校渐趋平静。大部分学生在坚持正常学习。西北大学计算机系的一位学生说，我们关心国家大事，关心改革，心情应当得到理解，但是，一些坏人乘机打砸抢烧，不能容忍。这不利于国家安定。也不符合我们的意愿。希望国家对这些人依法严惩。当时我们考虑问题太简单，没想到会引起这样大的事端。我们希望国家安定团结，改革继续深入，同时也希望政府切实改进工作，减少失误，肃贪树廉，为社会的发展创造更好的条件。
    学校的一些教师和有关部门的负责人，回顾了几天来的经历后分析说，现在的青年人，大都出生在“文革”初期，成长在改革开放年代，对动乱的危害和来之不易的安定团结局面没有切身体会。他们对国家的改革和进步，对科学和民主要求很迫切，但对改革的艰难和十年改革所取得的成就又缺乏科学的认识，不懂得在中国目前条件下，不可能完全照搬西方那种民主。加之我们的思想政治工作在很多方面不适应新的形势，终于发生了一些不应该发生的事。我们也要认真总结经验教训。
    记者还就“４·２２”事件访问了正在参加陕西省七届人大二次会议的一些代表。他们认为，改革十年来，我们取得了很大成绩，但也确有很多失误，存在着不少腐败现象。各级领导干部都要从这一事件中好好思考一下，自己在群众心目中的形象怎么样。对于现在存在的一些腐败现象，政府必须采取切实可行的措施，真正解决问题。他们希望各级领导干部要经常同工人、农民、学生对话，听取他们的意见，把工作做好。
