When a business falls ill, should one invite a renowned expert or hide the ailment and avoid seeking medical help?

Business diagnostics is akin to giving a business a thorough check-up. As a form of management consulting service, it is not new in economically developed countries, but it is a first in China.

In early May, the International Economic Consulting Company and the International Financial Consulting Firm—Arthur Andersen & Co.—both subsidiaries of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), jointly launched a business diagnostics service, marking a new attempt.

According to analysis, businesses may encounter crises in several stages: start-up, survival, expansion, and maturity. Although three-in-one enterprises (joint ventures, cooperative ventures, and wholly foreign-owned enterprises) in China generally operate well, some still face various issues in management, finance, marketing, and technology. Some are in dire straits. What should be done? Some state-owned and collective enterprises are severely loss-making. Should they be reorganized or liquidated? Some disputes over business survival involve debts. Should they be resolved in court or outside of court? Business diagnostics can provide comprehensive consulting services for these issues.

"Is your service like an outpatient clinic?" someone asked.

"More accurately, we are an emergency center, treating critical cases. Our main task is to help businesses get out of trouble or avoid crises, prescribe remedies, and even provide effective treatments. If necessary, we can quickly find new lenders or investors for the business."

"Can you save them all?"

"Of course not. If diagnostics show that a business is beyond help, we will say so directly. However, we can also assist with a 'peaceful exit,' reducing the pain and aftermath of bankruptcy." Over the past year, the China International Economic Consulting Company has provided consulting services to about 20 foreign-invested enterprises, helping to resolve some difficulties.

### 给企业看“病”

　　给企业看“病”
    泓赓
    企业有了病，是请来“名医”，还是讳疾忌医？
    企业诊断就是为企业搭脉看病的。它作为一项管理咨询服务，在经济发达国家并不新鲜，但在我国还属首次。
    五月初，中信集团下属国际经济咨询公司和国际财务咨询企业——安达信公司联合推出了企业诊断服务，就是一种新的尝试。
    据分析，企业可能发生危机大致有这几个阶段：起步阶段、生存阶段、扩大再生产阶段、成熟阶段。在我国兴办的三资企业尽管一般经营良好，但也有一些在经营管理、财务、市场、技术等方面存在各种问题，有的处于困境，怎么办？有些国营企业、集体企业亏损严重，是整顿还是破产？有些关于企业存亡的债务纠纷，是法庭上解决好，还是法庭外解决好？……企业诊断可以为之提供全面的咨询服务。
    “你们是‘门诊部’吗？”有人问。“更确切说，我们是‘急救中心’，诊治的是‘重病号’。主要任务是帮助企业摆脱困境或避免危机，开出药方，甚至提供良药。如必要时可为企业迅速找到新的贷款者或投资者等。”
    “你们都能救过来吗？”
    “当然不是。经过诊断认为无救的，则直告。不过也可以帮助‘安乐死’，减少企业在破产中的痛苦及其后遗症。”一年多来，中国国际经济咨询公司已为二十家左右的外商投资企业提供了咨询，协助解决了一些困难。
