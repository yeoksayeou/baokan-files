	Electrode Feeding Device Significantly Saves Energy

	BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The electric arc furnace, notorious for its enormous energy consumption and dubbed the "electric tiger," can now be equipped with an electrode feeding energy-saving device. This technology, initially applied only to the smelting of metallic silicon, was approved as a utility model patent by the Chinese Patent Office in April this year.

	This device was invented by Liu Shangren, General Manager of the Gansu Silicon Industry Group and Director of Lanzhou Silicon Factory, in 1987. Lanzhou Silicon Factory and other units have been using this energy-saving device, resulting in a reduction of approximately 30 percent in the electricity consumption per ton of metallic silicon produced. The average power consumption per ton is now 11,000 degrees, which is lower than the national standard of 15,000 degrees per ton.

　　电极馈电装置    
    节电效果明显
    本报讯  记者李林报道：因耗电量极大而被称作“电老虎”的矿热电炉，已能配备电极馈电节电装置。这项目前只适于冶炼金属硅的节电技术，今年四月获中国专利局批准为实用新型专利。
    这一装置是甘肃硅工业集团公司总经理、兰州硅厂厂长刘尚仁一九八七年发明的。兰州硅厂等单位率先运用该节电装置，使金属硅生产的吨耗电下降百分之三十左右，平均单耗每吨一万一千度，低于国家专核的每吨一万五千度标准。
