In the past, it was common to see large flatbreads priced at 2 piastre (approximately 5 fen in Chinese currency) each, piled up on the streets of Cairo. Passersby only needed to toss a small coin to take home a stack of bread, enough to feed a family of five for a day.

Now, such cheap deals are a thing of the past. Scenes of residents queuing to buy bread have become common in Cairo. Although the Eid al-Fitr, which began yesterday, still has a festive atmosphere, the shadow of food shortages is looming over people's hearts.

On May 1, President Mubarak revealed to the Egyptian people the stark reality: Egypt's population is booming, and the country's food consumption has reached an unsustainable level. He said that since he took office, Egypt's population has surged from 42.2 million to 52.3 million, adding 10 million mouths to feed in less than a decade. When he first took office (1981-1982), he only needed to secure 17.6 billion Egyptian pounds worth of subsidized goods and food. Now, without 44.6 billion Egyptian pounds worth of food supplies, it is impossible to get by. He also reminded everyone that the world price of wheat has risen from $85 per ton in 1986-1987 to $200 per ton in 1988-1989...

Egypt's food shortages are just a microcosm of the widespread food scarcity in the Arab world. Countries like Jordan, Syria, Algeria, Sudan, and Somalia are facing similar challenges. According to the annual economic report from the Arab League Secretariat, since the 1980s, food production in Arab countries (excluding Saudi Arabia) has experienced two significant declines. Currently, 50% to 70% of various food items are imported.

Data shows that between 1970 and 1985, the average annual growth rate of agriculture in Arab countries was only 2.5%, while the demand for grain to maintain the original consumption level increased at a rate of 6%. The arable land area in Arab countries has not increased, remaining at 27.8% of the total land area (1985 statistics), while the population growth rate is the highest in the world, not less than 3%.

The decline in food production and the rapid population growth have made the food shortage problem in the Arab world increasingly acute. Arab economic circles are alarmed, noting that the 1.4 billion hectares of land in Arab countries can only produce enough food to feed half of the current 202 million population. According to Arab economic experts, neglecting investment in agriculture and outdated agricultural production methods are important reasons for the backwardness of food production in the Arab world. Since 1984, most Arab countries have actually allocated only 8% of their annual budgets to agricultural production. Agricultural production has maintained the model of the early 20th century. Due to the low prices of agricultural products in the domestic market, rural labor has flowed out, and production has declined year after year. Although large-scale food imports temporarily relieve the immediate crisis, they also further impact the domestic agricultural production mechanism, creating a vicious cycle. Arab governments and citizens are all pondering the way forward and seeking solutions to this difficult problem.

### 阿拉伯世界粮食短缺——写在伊斯兰教开斋节

　　阿拉伯世界粮食短缺   
    ——写在伊斯兰教开斋节
    本报记者  林皎明
    以往，开罗街头常见的一景是，２个皮阿斯特（合人民币约５分钱）一张的大饼多得堆放在地上。过路人只要扔下一张小毛票，就能抱上一摞大饼回家，够５口之家吃一天的。
    如今，这么便宜的买卖没有了。居民排队抢购大饼的场面，在开罗已经不是新鲜事。尽管从昨天开始的开斋节还有欢乐气氛，但食品紧缺的阴影正朝人们心头袭来。
    穆巴拉克总统５月１日向全体埃及国民交了底牌：埃及人口膨胀，国家的粮食消费量已经达到无法承担的地步。他说，他当政以来，埃及人口从４２２０万猛增到５２３０万，不到１０年多出１０００万人吃饭。上任之初（１９８１年—１９８２年），他只需备足１７６亿埃镑政府贴补价格的商品和食品，而现在，没有价值４４６亿埃镑的食品供应，就别想过日子。他还提醒大家，世界小麦价格已由１９８６至１９８７年的每吨８５美元，上升到１９８８至１９８９年的２００美元……
    埃及食品紧缺的窘境，只是阿拉伯世界普遍缺粮现象的一个缩影。约旦、叙利亚、阿尔及利亚、苏丹、索马里等国都面临同样的困扰。据阿拉伯联盟秘书处提供的年度经济报告统计，８０年代以来，阿拉伯国家粮食生产（除沙特阿拉伯以外）两次大幅度下降，现在５０％至７０％的各类食品依靠进口。
    数据表明，１９７０—１９８５年间，阿拉伯各国年平均农业生产增长率只有２．５％，而维持原有消耗水平的粮食需求量却以６％的速度递增。阿拉伯各国的耕地面积基本没有增加，即占全部国土的２７．８％（１９８５年统计数字），而人口增长率居世界首位，不低于３％。
    粮食生产下降，人口迅速增长，使阿拉伯世界的食品短缺矛盾日益尖锐。阿拉伯经济界人士惊呼，１４亿公顷的阿拉伯国家土地所能生产的粮食只能养活现有２．０２亿人口的一半。据阿拉伯经济专家分析，忽视农业投资、农业生产手段陈旧，是导致阿拉伯世界粮食生产落后的重要原因之一。１９８４年以来，多数阿拉伯国家对农业生产的投资实际只占年度预算的８％。农业生产维持着本世纪初的模式。由于国内市场上的农产品价格低廉，致使农村劳力外流，生产连年萎缩。食品大量进口，虽然一时解燃眉之急，却也进一步冲击了本国农业生产机制，产生恶性循环。阿拉伯各国政府和民众都在思索着出路，寻找解决难题的良策。
