Parks are public recreational spaces, and every visitor should follow the park's regulations and cherish every blade of grass and tree. However, the people in the picture not only ignore the rules and rush in, but they also use the "prohibited sign" as a resting place for their backsides. This is a scene from Chengdu People's Park.

    “请勿入内”偏要入内
    公园是公共娱乐场所，每位游客都应遵守园内管理规定，爱护一草一木。可图中诸君非但熟视无睹、大量涌入，连“禁令筒”也成了他们臀下小憩之具。这是成都市人民公园内的一处“景观”。
