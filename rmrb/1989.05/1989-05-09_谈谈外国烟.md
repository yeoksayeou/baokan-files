A few years ago, brands like "Marlboro" were only occasionally seen in the southeastern coastal regions, but today they are widespread across the country.

Nowadays, more and more Westerners are becoming aware of the harm that smoking causes to the human body, and almost all developed countries are vigorously promoting smoking cessation. However, at the same time, foreign cigarettes are flooding into China. There are two main channels for importing foreign cigarettes: one is smuggling; the other is foreign trade imports. Smuggling should be cracked down on. However, it is bewildering that our poor country spends a large amount of foreign exchange to import foreign cigarettes. Is it because smoking is beneficial? Is it because domestic cigarette production cannot meet demand? Has the consumption level of our people risen to the point where they must smoke foreign cigarettes? Or is it...?

Whether or not to spend money on buying foreign cigarettes is one issue, but what is more worrying is that the trend of smoking foreign cigarettes is on the rise, fostering a culture of extravagance and damaging our national pride and sense of achievement. Now, some young people, when they meet, feel that if they don't take out a foreign cigarette, they are not "cool" enough and lose face. Some people even look down on domestic brand-name cigarettes.

It is time to address this issue.

　　谈谈外国烟
    厦门大学  关棣尧
    几年前，只是在东南沿海一带偶尔见到的“万宝路”之类的洋烟，今天已遍布神州了。
    现在，不少西方人越来越重视吸烟给人体带来的危害，几乎所有的发达国家都在大力倡导戒烟。而与此同时，洋烟却大量流入我国。输入洋烟的渠道不外有两条：一是走私；二是外贸进口。对于走私的应该打击。然而，我们这个穷国花费大量外汇进口洋烟，实在令人百思不解。是吸烟有益？是国内烟生产供不应求？是国人消费水平已高到非吸洋烟不可的地步？还是……
    该不该为买外国烟花这些钱是一回事，更令人忧虑的是，吸洋烟之风盛行，使奢靡之风日长，民族自尊心、自豪感受到伤害。现在，一些青年人见面，如果掏出的不是外国烟，便感到不够“派”，脸上无光。有些人对国产名烟也不屑一顾了。
    这个问题到了该管一管的时候了。
