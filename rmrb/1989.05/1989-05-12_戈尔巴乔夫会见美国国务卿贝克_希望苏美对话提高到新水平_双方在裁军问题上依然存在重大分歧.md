Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 11th.

Soviet leader Gorbachev expressed the hope on May 11th to elevate the level of Soviet-American dialogue to a new height during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Baker.

According to TASS, Baker handed a letter from U.S. President Bush to Gorbachev, but the content of the letter was not disclosed.

In nearly an hour of talks, the two sides discussed the issue of high-level meetings. Gorbachev said he believed that dialogue between the two sides should be maintained and elevated to a new level to promote cooperation and joint action on all issues.

Baker asked Gorbachev to introduce the situation of domestic reforms in the Soviet Union and said that although the U.S. had different views on the Soviet reforms, no one in the government wanted the reforms to fail. Baker believed that the reforms were opening up tremendous possibilities for stable and fruitful Soviet-American relations.

Gorbachev informed Baker of the content of the additional proposals that the Soviet Union would put forward at the Vienna conventional weapons negotiations. It was revealed that the Soviet Union would propose unilateral reductions in tactical nuclear weapons.

During the talks, the two sides had a dispute over the modernization of tactical nuclear weapons in Europe. Gorbachev said that modernization was not only a concern for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe but also for the entire continent.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 11th. The talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and U.S. Secretary of State Baker have concluded. Today's talks indicated that negotiations on various items related to arms reduction will resume, but major disagreements on arms reduction issues still exist.

According to TASS, both sides believe that most of the work on drafting a treaty to reduce strategic offensive weapons by 50% has been completed and needs to be finalized.

During the talks, the U.S. side expounded on its general position regarding nuclear weapons and space weapons. The Soviet side emphasized that it is only possible to reduce strategic offensive weapons if the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty signed by the two countries is strictly adhered to.

Regarding tactical missiles, the Soviet side believes that retaining and modernizing such weapons would disrupt the stability of the military strategic situation in Europe. It proposed to start negotiations on reducing such weapons as soon as possible.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 11th (Reporter Tang Xiuzhe). U.S. Secretary of State Baker considered this round of U.S.-Soviet talks "very beneficial and fruitful," and "constructive"; Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze also declared that the "talks were in a good, frank, and practical atmosphere" and had "positive significance." However, he expressed great concern over Baker's unchanged position on arms reduction issues.

　　戈尔巴乔夫会见美国国务卿贝克    
    希望苏美对话提高到新水平    
    双方在裁军问题上依然存在重大分歧
    新华社莫斯科５月１１日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫１１日在会见美国国务卿贝克时表示希望把苏美对话提高到新的水平。
    据塔斯社报道，贝克向戈尔巴乔夫转交了美国总统布什的一封信，但报道没有透露信件的内容。
    双方在近１小时的交谈中涉及到高级会晤问题。戈尔巴乔夫说，他相信双方对话应当保持并提高到新的水平，以便在所有问题上推进协同行动和合作。
    贝克请戈尔巴乔夫介绍苏联国内改革情况，并说，尽管美国对苏联改革有不同看法，但政府内没有人希望改革失败。贝克认为，改革正在为稳定的和富有成果的苏美关系开辟巨大的可能性。
    戈尔巴乔夫向贝克通报了苏联将向维也纳常规武器谈判提出补充建议的内容。据透露，苏联将提出单方面裁减战术核武器的建议。
    交谈中双方在欧洲战术核武器的现代化问题上发生了争议。戈尔巴乔夫说，现代化不仅是苏联和东欧，而且也是整个欧洲特别担心的事情。
    新华社莫斯科５月１１日电　苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽和美国国务卿贝克的会谈已结束。今天的会谈表明，双方有关裁军的各项谈判将恢复，但在裁军问题上的一些重大分歧依然存在。
    据塔斯社报道，双方认为起草削减５０％进攻性战略武器条约的大部分工作已经完成，现在需要将其进行到底。
    会谈中，美国方面就核武器和外空武器问题阐述了总的立场。苏联方面强调，只有按条约原样遵守１９７２年两国签订的反导弹防御条约，才有可能削减进攻性战略武器。
    关于战术导弹问题，苏方认为保留这类武器并使之现代化将破坏欧洲军事战略形势的稳定。它建议尽快就削减这类武器进行谈判。
    新华社莫斯科５月１１日电（记者唐修哲）美国国务卿贝克认为这次美苏会谈“极为有益和具有成果”，“带有建设性”；苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽也宣称“会谈气氛良好、坦率、求实”，“具有积极意义”。但他对贝克在裁军问题上的立场没有变化表示非常不安。　（附图片）
