Title: Unending Homesickness

Ten days of conference, on the first day from the hotel to the Great Hall of the People, I saw a row of willows by the roadside, with a hint of pale yellow on the branches. Ten days later, when the conference ended and I went to the Great Hall of the People again, the willows had turned into a lush green. Suddenly, a wave of homesickness surged in my heart; spring has arrived in the north, what would the scenery be like in my hometown in the south?

Back home, I found a book by Ye Lingfeng titled "Unable to Forget Jiangnan" in my book pile and read it by my pillow, which made me miss West Lake even more. Ye Lingfeng is from Nanjing, and I am from Hangzhou. Although we are in different places, we both belong to Jiangnan. Moreover, Lingfeng wrote about the Shouxi Lake in Yangzhou, which is a miniature replica of West Lake, so even if he wrote about Shouxi Lake, it was enough to make me, a Jiangnan person stranded in the north, feel melancholic.

Ye Lingfeng lived in Hong Kong during the war and settled in the remote island after the war. The texts in his book "Unable to Forget Jiangnan" were originally scattered in overseas publications, compiled into a volume by Jiang Deming, and named after an article in the book. However, the phrase "Unable to Forget Jiangnan" alone is enough to make a Jiangnan person feel nostalgic. Ye Lingfeng wrote: "But in Jiangnan, although spring is hard to find when it leaves, it is easy to find when it comes. Spring is spring, it never deceives, it never makes one falsely happy." Lingfeng had not lived in the north for long, his "false happiness" obviously refers to Hong Kong with its oceanic climate; I had also lived there for three years. Spring indeed comes and goes quietly. At that time, I was still a young man, and I was not very sensitive to the changes of the seasons; but now that I am old, I cannot remain indifferent to the changing seasons. Lingfeng wanted to find spring in Jiangnan, but the dream that haunted him was "a small pavilion in Zhenjiang." Where is my heart full of homesickness? It is the peach blossoms and willows of West Lake, the two peaks of North and South facing each other, and a small boat in the middle of the lake. As Lingfeng wrote, "There, not only is my spring, but also my dreams and my poetry."

In the article "Smoke and Flowers in March, Under Yangzhou," he wrote about Shouxi Lake, and I appreciated his sentence, "Only the willows and reeds along the shore, that expanse of spring light is priceless..." What a "priceless" sight! But in the north, the weather is so stingy that it makes one angry. First, there is the chilling spring cold, then a few small and large cold snaps and sandstorms, and suddenly summer has arrived. The Summer Palace, Tan Zhe Temple, and Kunming Lake all have my favorite white and light purple magnolias and lilacs, and the willows by the lake also dance in the wind, but these places are no longer where a weak person like me can stroll freely. I can only recite Bai Juyi's "Jiangnan Memories" in my heart when I see the willow catkins flying, "Jiangnan Memories, the most memorable is Hangzhou. Searching for osmanthus in the moonlight at the mountain temple, watching the tide from the pillow at the county pavilion. When will I be able to return again?" to comfort myself.

Ye Lingfeng truly missed his hometown deeply. In the 1960s, when he had the fortune to travel extensively in the south and north of the mainland, he would be moved by the scenery wherever he went. He stayed in a small hotel in Xinhui, Guangdong, where there were small bridges, flowing water, and willows, which made him "heartbroken." He wrote, "If West Lake were without willows, the loss of beauty would be unimaginable. The willows by Xiling Bridge, the tomb of Su Xiaoxiao under the willows, a small boat by the shore with many willow leaves on it. These are the charming essence of West Lake scenery." This vivid description, I think, is more charming than Bai Juyi's "Jiangnan Memories."

I thought that reading "Unable to Forget Jiangnan" could comfort my homesickness for my hometown, but because of Lingfeng's brilliant writing, my homesickness was even greater; but in any case, reading Lingfeng's texts made me feel a spiritual connection. Lingfeng passed away in Hong Kong in 1975, and it has been fourteen years since then. If his ashes could have been scattered over Jiangnan at that time, I think he would be happy in the afterlife.

　　写不尽的乡思
    冯亦代
    十天的会期，第一天从宾馆搭车到人民大会堂，看见路上有一排柳树，枝头微露鹅黄之色，十天后会议闭幕去大会堂的路上再见这排柳树，却已变成满枝嫩绿了。蓦然间心头升起一缕乡思；春已来到北国，江南故乡的景色又将如何呢？
    回到家里，在书堆里找出叶灵凤的《能不忆江南》在枕边读了，更使我思念故乡的西湖不止。叶灵凤是南京人，我则是杭州人，两处分隔，同属江南则一。何况灵凤曾写到扬州的瘦西湖，这是具体而微的西湖仿建，所以即使是他写的瘦西湖，读了也足使我这羁旅北国的江南人，为之黯然魂销。
    叶灵凤抗战时流寓香港，战后即在海隅之地小居，他这本《能不忆江南》所载的文字，原来散见于海外书刊，是姜德明给他辑成一卷的，且以书中一篇文章的题目作为书名。可是单凭“能不忆江南”这句话，就足使江南人为之憬然。叶灵凤在文章中说：“可是在江南，春天虽然去得不易寻觅，来得却有迹象可寻。春天就是春天，决不骗人，决不令人空欢喜。”灵凤没有在北国长住过，他之“空欢喜”，显然是指在海洋气候的香港；那里我也曾住过三年，春天的确是悄然而来，悄然而去的。那时，我还是“白夹少年”的时光，对于四季变换，并不那么敏感；而现在则老景已现，对于四季的更易，便不能木然处之了。灵凤要到江南寻春，而梦魂萦绕的却是“镇江的一间小楼”，我的满腔乡思又在什么地方呢？是那个桃红柳绿的西子湖，是南北二峰对峙，中挟一湖，放棹于湖上的一叶扁舟。正如灵凤写的，“在那里不仅有我的春天，还有我的梦，也有我的诗。”
    在《烟花三月下扬州》一篇里，他写到瘦西湖，我欣赏他的一句“只有沿岸的垂柳和芦苇，那一派荡漾的春光是不用钱买的……”，好个“不用钱买的！”但在北国，天公却吝啬得令人生气，初是料峭春寒，再来几次大小不一的寒流和几阵风沙，倏忽间夏天就已来临。颐和园、潭柘寺固有我喜爱的洁白与浅紫的玉兰和丁香，昆明湖边也有随风翩跹的垂柳，然而这些地方已不再是病弱若我者可以逍遥游逛的了，只能在目睹杨花飞舞时，心里暗诵白乐天的“江南忆，最忆是杭州。山寺月中寻桂子，郡亭枕上看潮头。何日得重游？”聊以自慰而已。
    叶灵凤对于他家乡，真是刻骨相思，６０年代当他有幸在大陆南北遨游时，随处都会触景生情。他在广东新会宾馆小住，园林中有小桥流水与丝丝垂柳，这番景象，使他“销魂”，他写道：“西湖的风景，若是没有了柳树，那减色的程度简直难以想象。西泠桥畔的柳色，柳下的苏小小墓，岸边垂柳下的一只无人小船，船上沾了许多柳叶。这都是西湖景物迷人的神髓。”这段入神的描画，我想比白乐天的《忆江南》更加有其情趣。
    原以为读了《能不忆江南》，可以慰我对故乡的思念，不想由于灵凤生花妙笔的写情写景，更倍增我的乡思；但无论如何，读了一遍灵凤的文字，使我有通灵之感。灵凤于１９７５年客逝香港，于兹已十四载，如果当年能将他的骨灰洒向江南，我想他在泉下也会欣然的。
