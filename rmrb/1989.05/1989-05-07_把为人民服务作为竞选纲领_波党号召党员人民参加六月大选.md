The second national congress of the Polish United Workers' Party today adopted a "Campaign Platform," calling on all party members and the nation to support the party's candidates in the June elections.

The elections for the Polish parliament and senate are scheduled for June 4 this year. As the election approaches, campaign activities have begun nationwide. Various political parties, social organizations, and the constructive opposition, including Solidarity, have all put forward their own campaign platforms and candidates.

The closing session of the Polish United Workers' Party's national congress focused on the domestic situation before the elections, the party's stance on participating in the elections, and adopted the "Campaign Platform."

The congress opened on May 4. Over the past two days, delegates discussed the Political Bureau's "Guideline Report," the speeches by the first secretary of the Central Committee, Jaruzelski, and Prime Minister Rakowski. Delegates expressed satisfaction with the significant progress made in political reforms since the party's 10th Congress but were puzzled by the lack of results in economic reforms. Of the 61 delegates who spoke, the vast majority called on the Political Bureau and the government to start from reality, summarize the experience of political reforms, adjust the economic and production structure, and accelerate the pace of economic reforms to "improve the Polish economy, which is on the brink of crisis."

According to a report by the Polish News Agency, the congress also adopted a document titled "The Stance of the Second National Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party on Eliminating the Remnants of Stalinism and Its Consequences in Poland." The document emphasized the historical background of this phenomenon and suggested establishing effective supervisory bodies to prevent similar incidents from recurring.

In his closing remarks, Jaruzelski, the leader of the Polish United Workers' Party, expressed the hope that the entire party would work hard to advance the cause of socialist renewal. He also called on all party members to "fight and compete" in the June elections.

According to reports from here, the "Campaign Declaration" of the Polish United Workers' Party, published in today's newspapers, takes "Serving the People" as the party's campaign platform for the parliamentary elections.

The declaration states that the party will influence national policies through its representatives in the parliament, senate, and people's congress. The party supports the principle of separation of legislative, executive, and judicial powers, the expansion of local autonomy, the freedom of citizens to express their views and beliefs, and the diversification of trade unions.

The declaration expresses support for a fundamental transformation of the Polish economy and the equal opportunities for various economic ownership systems. The declaration believes that reforms must ensure better living conditions, social justice, and social security for the working people, rather than causing unemployment.

The declaration points out that the Polish United Workers' Party, as the party that realizes the ideals of the working class and the party of the working people, has no other platform besides serving the people. The party will create conditions to effectively safeguard the sovereignty, independence, and security of the motherland. The party will strengthen friendly cooperation with allies and broadly develop relations with other countries, firmly advocating for Poland's openness to the world market.

During the parliamentary elections in June, Poland will not only elect members of parliament but also select senators for the senate and, on this basis, elect the president. This is a major reform of the parliamentary system in Poland.

　　把为人民服务作为竞选纲领    
    波党号召党员人民参加六月大选
    据新华社华沙５月５日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰统一工人党第二次全国代表会议今天通过《竞选纲领》，号召全体党员和全国人民支持该党参加６月大选的候选人。
    波兰议会和参议院选举定于今年６月４日举行。随着大选临近，竞选活动已在全国展开。各党派、社会团体和包括团结工会在内的建设性反对派都纷纷制定竞选纲领，提出自己的候选人。
    今天闭幕的波党全国代表会议着重讨论了大选前的国内形势、波党参加竞选的立场并通过了《竞选纲领》。
    波党全国代表会议是５月４日在这里开幕的。两天来，代表们讨论了政治局的《纲领性报告》、中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基和政府总理拉科夫斯基的讲话。代表们对党的“十大”以来政治改革方面取得的重大进展“表示满意”，但对经济改革收效不大“感到不解”。在会上发言的６１位代表绝大多数要求政治局和政府从实际出发，总结政治改革的经验，调整经济和生产结构，以加速经济改革的步伐，“改善处于危机边缘的波兰经济”。
    另据波通社报道，会议最后通过了一个文件——“波兰统一工人党全国代表会议关于铲除斯大林主义的残余和消除它在波兰的后果的立场”。文件强调了产生这一现象的历史背景，建议成立有效的监督机构，以防止类似现象再次发生。
    波党领导人雅鲁泽尔斯基今天在闭幕词中希望全党努力工作，把社会主义革新事业推向前进。他还要求全体党员“以战斗和竞争的姿态”投入６月大选。
    据新华社华沙５月６日电　此间报纸今天公布的波兰统一工人党《竞选宣言》把“为人民服务”作为该党参加议会大选的竞选纲领。
    宣言说，党将通过自己在议会、参议院和人民会议中的代表对国家政策施加影响。党赞成实行立法、执法和法院三权分立的原则，赞成扩大地方自治权，赞成公民公开表达自己的观点和信仰自由，赞成工会多元化。
    宣言表示，赞成根本改造波兰经济，赞成各种经济所有制机会均等。宣言认为，改革必须保证劳动人民有更好的生活条件、社会公正和社会保险，而不应造成失业。
    宣言指出，波兰统一工人党作为实现工人阶级理想的党和劳动人民的党，除为人民服务外，没有其他纲领。党将创造条件，有效地保障祖国的主权、独立和安全。党将加强同盟国的友好与合作，并广泛发展与其他国家的关系，坚决主张波兰的世界市场开放。
    今年６月份举行的议会大选期间，波兰将不仅选举议会议员，还将增选参议院的参议员，并在此基础上选举总统。这是波兰议会制度重大改革。
