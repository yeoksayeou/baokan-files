	Reporter Fabricates News Exposed
	Asahi Shimbun President Resigns

	New China News Agency, Tokyo, May 26th — Today, the Asahi Shimbun held a press conference announcing that its president, Ichiryu Toshio, has resigned due to misconduct. His position will be taken over by Nakae Yoshitada.

	The reason for Ichiryu's resignation is as follows: A photographer from the Asahi Shimbun, Honda Yoshiro, fabricated news by carving the letters "KY" on a coral reef in the waters off Iriomote Island in Okinawa Prefecture. He then took a photograph of the damage and published it in the April 21st evening edition of the Asahi Shimbun, falsely claiming that someone had acted irresponsibly and damaged the natural environment. This deception was later exposed by local residents, leading to widespread criticism from other newspapers, which condemned such hypocritical behavior. As a result, the Asahi Shimbun's reputation has been severely damaged.

	Prior to this incident, the newspaper had already replaced its editorial director and dismissed the photographer, Honda. Additionally, Honda's colleague received a three-month suspension.

　　记者制造新闻被揭露
  　《朝日新闻》社长引咎辞职
    新华社东京５月２６日电  日本《朝日新闻》社今天举行记者招待会，宣布该报社社长一柳东一郎引咎辞职，其职务由中江利忠担任。
    一柳辞职的原因是：该社摄影记者本田嘉郎为了制造新闻，在冲绳县西表岛的水中珊瑚礁上刻下“ＫＹ”２字，然后拍下照片发表在４月２１日《朝日新闻》晚报上，并撰文谎称有人不讲公德，破坏自然。这一伎俩后被当地居民揭穿后，各家报社纷纷发表文章，指责这种客里空的行为，致使该报声誉受损。
    在此之前，该报社还因此事更换了编辑局长，解雇了摄影记者本田，给本田的同行者以停职３个月的处分。
