The Supervision Department and the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Government have decided to revoke Wei Mingsheng's party and administrative positions and order him to return all gifts and hand them over to the state treasury.

	The People's Daily reports: Reporters Shu Yu and Jing Xianfeng report: Wei Mingsheng, who once became a news figure known as the "feasting official," has recently had all his party and administrative positions revoked.

	Wei Mingsheng is a member of the National People's Congress and a member of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress. He formerly served as the head of the Ankang Region, a well-known poverty-stricken area in China. At the end of last year, he was transferred to the position of deputy director of the Shaanxi Provincial Economic Commission (at the rank of deputy minister).

	After learning of the arrangement to transfer him to the Provincial Economic Commission, Wei Mingsheng, before officially taking up his new position, proposed to visit and say farewell to various counties (cities), enterprises, and institutions under the jurisdiction of Ankang Region. He took this opportunity to accept banquets and gifts, earning him the nickname "farewell official" and "feasting official" among local residents.

	This spring, newspapers exposed Wei Mingsheng's acceptance of banquets and gifts. Subsequently, the Supervision Department, in conjunction with the Shaanxi Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Supervision Bureau, formed a joint investigation team to conduct an investigation. It was confirmed that the information exposed in the newspapers was basically true. From September 27, 1988, to December 19, 1988, excluding the more than 20 days he spent recuperating in Guangdong, Wei Mingsheng's "farewell" and "goodbye" activities lasted a total of 51 days. During this period, he attended banquets in 19 units, totaling 34 tables, spending public funds amounting to 3272 yuan; he participated in farewell banquets held by 32 units; he accepted 25 kinds of gifts purchased with public funds from 19 units, including silk bedspreads, towels, electric blankets, quartz clocks, tea sets, and cigarettes and alcohol, totaling 1113 yuan. According to incomplete statistics, the above three items totaled 5336 yuan in public funds.

	Recently, the State Supervision Department and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government unanimously decided to give Wei Mingsheng an administrative demotion. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee decided to revoke Wei Mingsheng's party positions; at the same time, he was ordered to return all the gifts he received and hand them over to the state treasury.

　　监察部和陕西省委省政府作出决定    
    撤销魏明生党内外职务
    责令其退出全部礼品并上缴国库
    本报讯  记者舒瑜、景险峰报道：一度成为新闻人物的“吃喝专员”魏明生，近日被撤销党内外一切职务。
    魏明生是全国人大代表和陕西省人大代表，曾任全国有名的贫困地区——安康地区的行署专员。去年底，他调任陕西省经委副主任（正厅级）。
    魏明生得知上级安排他去省经委工作后，在尚未正式移交工作时，主动提出到安康地区所属县（市）企事业等单位“告别”、“辞行”。他趁机四处吃请受礼，被当地群众称为“告别专员”、“吃喝专员”。
    今年春，报纸披露了魏明生的吃请受礼问题。随后，监察部会同陕西省纪委、省监察厅组成联合调查组进行了调查，确定报纸披露的情况基本属实。魏明生从１９８８年９月２７日至１２月１９日，除去到广东疗养２０多天外，“告别”、“辞行”活动累计长达５１天。他在１９个单位吃请１９次，共摆宴３４桌，花费公款３２７２元；他参加了３２个单位为其举行的“告别会”；他收受１９个单位用公款购买的礼品２５种，包括丝被面、毛巾被、电热毯、石英钟、茶具、烟酒，共折款１１１３元。据不完全统计，以上３项共计花费公款５３３６元。
    近日，国家监察部和陕西省人民政府一致决定，给予魏明生行政撤职处分。中共陕西省委决定，撤销魏明生党内职务；同时，责令其将收受的礼品全部退出并上缴国库。
