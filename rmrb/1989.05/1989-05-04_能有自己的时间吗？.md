Every time I finish a day of hard work and lie down exhausted, I always ask myself with a mix of sadness, hope, and doubt: We female workers in enterprises, who have both work responsibilities and household chores, can we have our own time? Time that belongs only to us for grooming, reading, socializing, and resting?

Just a few years out of school, the innocence of youth has not yet fully faded, and the charm of a young girl is still faintly visible. However, the romantic life of studying under the lamp, strolling in the garden, and daydreaming in front of the mirror has already become a distant memory. We are too busy; we have entered the hardships of life too early. Every morning, we get up in the dark, quickly wash our faces, grab our lunch boxes, and rush to the factory by bus or bicycle from all corners of the city. In the evening, the same process is repeated in the opposite direction, still hurriedly. At home, there are infants crying for milk, dust to be cleaned, clothes to be washed. Of course, we also need to spend a couple of hours preparing food for our growling stomachs. Sundays are the peak of busyness, with major household chores all needing to be completed in one day of "rest": mending, washing, ironing, shopping, and buying groceries...

We hope to have our own time, feeling that such time is not impossible to obtain. Otherwise, wouldn't we sisters quickly become old women!

　　能有自己的时间吗？
    华北制药厂  张丽虹
    每当我结束一整天的忙碌，疲惫地躺下以后，总要和着伤感、期待和疑虑自问：我们这些既有工作重任、又有家务负累的企业女职工，还能有自己的时间吗——只属于我们个人的梳妆打扮、看书读报、交际聚会、休养生息的时间？
    走出校门刚几年，天真稚气还没有退尽，少女的风采依稀可辨，可那灯下夜读、园中散步、镜前遐想的浪漫生活已经成为遥远的回忆。我们太忙，我们过早走进了生活的艰辛：每天早上摸黑从床上爬起，匆忙擦把脸，便挟着饭盒，乘大车骑小车，从城市的四面八方赶到工厂。到了晚上，同样的过程再反方向重复一遍，仍是匆匆忙忙。家里有嗷嗷待哺的婴儿，有待清扫的灰尘，待洗的衣服。当然，还得为咕咕直叫的肚子去忙活一两个小时。星期天是忙碌的高潮，大宗的家务事都要在一天的“休息”时间完成：拆缝浆洗，购物买菜……
    我们希望得到自己的时间，觉得这样的时间并非不能得到。要不然我们这些小姐妹们岂不很快就成老太婆了吗！
