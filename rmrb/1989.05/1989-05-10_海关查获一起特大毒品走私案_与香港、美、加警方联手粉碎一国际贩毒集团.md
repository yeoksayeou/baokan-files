Customs Seizes Major Drug Smuggling Case
	Collaborates with Hong Kong, U.S., and Canadian Authorities to Smash an International Drug Trafficking Gang

	According to a report from our newspaper, on the morning of March 21, the Huangpu Customs in Guangzhou's Huangpu Port discovered 39.34 kilograms of No. 4 heroin hidden in a shipment of automatic nylon umbrellas. This batch of drugs, packed in a container, was mixed with 300 boxes of automatic nylon umbrellas, intended to be shipped via Hong Kong to Toronto, Canada, and New York, USA. This is the largest drug smuggling case ever seized by Chinese customs since the founding of the People's Republic.

	After the case was discovered, Huangpu Customs immediately transferred it to the public security authorities that night. The next morning, officials from the public security and customs departments went to Shenzhen and established contact with the Hong Kong police and customs. Through Interpol, they cooperated with the U.S. and Canadian authorities to solve the case. After seven weeks of close surveillance, actions were taken on May 6 and 7 in the U.S., Hong Kong, and other places, arresting seven members of the drug trafficking gang and seizing a total of 44.2 kilograms of drugs and two handguns.

　　海关查获一起特大毒品走私案    
    与香港、美、加警方联手粉碎一国际贩毒集团
    本报讯  今年３月２１日上午，黄埔海关在广州黄埔港外运仓库码头，从一批申报出口的自动尼龙伞中，查获４号海洛因３９．３４公斤。这批装于集装箱内的毒品，混装在装有自动尼龙伞的３００个纸箱中，准备经香港，运往加拿大多伦多和美国纽约。这是建国以来我国海关查获的最大的毒品走私案件。
    案发后，黄埔海关连夜将此案移交公安部门。次日凌晨，公安、海关负责人分赴深圳，与香港警方和海关取得联系，并通过国际刑警组织与美、加警方合作破案。经过７个星期的严密监视，于本月６日、７日在美国、香港等地采取行动，抓获贩毒集团分子７人，共缴获毒品４４．２公斤，手枪两支。　（常敏）
