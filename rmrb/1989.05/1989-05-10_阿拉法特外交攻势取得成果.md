The diplomatic offensive by Yasser Arafat, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), has concluded his official visit to France. In just two days, Arafat discussed the Middle East situation with French President François Mitterrand and other key figures in French politics, achieving significant results. It is noteworthy that this is Arafat's first important visit to a Western power since the establishment of the State of Palestine in November last year. According to French newspapers, this visit marks the beginning of a new diplomatic offensive by the PLO.

This new offensive is mainly manifested in the following ways: First, by declaring that the PLO Charter is outdated, Arafat once again affirmed the reality of recognizing Israel's existence, thereby dispelling the pretext spread by Israel that the PLO's policies are inconsistent. Second, in order to encourage Israel to participate in the Middle East International Conference, the PLO agreed to form a joint delegation of Arab countries, including Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and the State of Palestine, to participate in the conference, thereby eliminating Israel's excuse for not wanting to engage in direct dialogue with the PLO. Third, in response to Israel's proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories, Arafat expressed his willingness to place the elections under UN supervision in the manner of Namibia, effectively adopting Israel's proposal. All of these indicate the PLO's sincerity in achieving Middle East peace, winning widespread praise from global public opinion. French President Mitterrand praised the PLO for having "walked 90% of the way" in seeking negotiations. The U.S. State Department welcomed Arafat's speech, stating that it was "a step in the right direction." Although the Israeli government rejected the speech, Labor Party parliamentary leader Shimon Peres considered the speech "very important," suggesting that the PLO and Israel "engage in indirect dialogue through the United States." The PLO's peace offensive appears to be bearing fruit.

The prolonged stalemate over the Palestinian issue has drawn global attention. To resolve this problem as soon as possible, the PLO has been leading the uprising in the occupied territories, resisting Israeli authorities' repression, while actively launching a diplomatic offensive, hoping to find a peaceful solution to the Palestinian issue through dialogue and consultation among the relevant parties. The U.S.-PLO dialogue that began at the end of last year is a result of the PLO's diplomatic efforts. Following this, Arafat visited Spain and had formal contact with the European Community, actively promoting Western Europe's actions to resolve the Palestinian issue. Arafat's recent visit to France is a continuation of these efforts.

As an important member of the European Community, France is particularly concerned about the Palestinian issue. As early as the 1970s, France voted in favor of recognizing "Palestinian rights" in the United Nations. France was also the first Western country to officially receive Palestinian leaders. During his talks with Arafat, President Mitterrand emphasized that the Palestinians "have the right to a state," providing clear and positive support to the PLO for the first time. It is also noted that France will assume the presidency of the European Community on July 1, which places a direct responsibility on it to promote the convening of the Middle East International Conference and to facilitate direct dialogue between the Palestinians and Israelis. Additionally, France maintains good relations with Israel. France's unique position enables it to play a special role in resolving the Palestinian issue, which is beneficial for accelerating the Middle East peace process.

The PLO's rapprochement with European countries and the increasing flexibility in its struggle strategy have forced the United States to adjust its policies accordingly. The direct U.S.-PLO dialogue has shifted from a clear bias towards Israel to "placing the PLO and Israel more or less on an equal footing," indicating that the United States is also working to ease the Middle East situation. However, these efforts have had little effect, mainly because Israel remains stubborn on the Middle East issue. Therefore, it is essential to urge the United States to pressure Israel to quickly change its stance, which is undoubtedly the key to breaking the current Middle East negotiation stalemate. Arab countries and European Community countries should have a common goal in this regard.

### 阿拉法特外交攻势取得成果

　　阿拉法特外交攻势取得成果
    柯月霖
    巴勒斯坦解放组织执委会主席阿拉法特对法国的正式访问已经结束。在短短的两天内，阿拉法特同密特朗总统等法国政界要人讨论了中东局势，取得不小的成果。人们注意到，这是去年１１月巴勒斯坦国成立以来阿拉法特首次对一个西方大国进行的重要访问，按照法国报纸的说法，标志着巴解在外交上发动了一轮新的攻势。
    这个新攻势主要表现在：首先，阿拉法特通过宣称巴解宪章已经过时，再次肯定了承认以色列的存在这个现实，这就打消了以色列散播的巴解政纲前后不一的口实；其次，为了争取以色列参加中东国际会议，巴解组织同意由叙利亚、约旦、黎巴嫩、埃及和巴勒斯坦国组成阿拉伯国家联合代表团参加这个会议，这就排除了以色列不愿与巴解直接对话的借口；第三，针对以色列提出的在被占领土上举行选举的建议，阿拉法特表示可以按照纳米比亚方式将选举置于联合国监督之下，实际上把以色列的建议接了过来。所有这些都表明巴解组织对实现中东和平的一番诚意，赢得世界舆论的普遍赞扬。法国密特朗总统称赞在争取和谈方面“巴解已走了９０％的路程”。美国国务院欢迎阿拉法特的讲话，认为这是“朝好的方向迈出了一步。”以色列政府虽然拒绝了这个讲话，但工党议会党团领袖拉蒙却认为讲话“十分重要”，建议巴解和以色列“通过美国”进行间接对话。巴解组织的这次和平攻势看来已见成效。
    巴勒斯坦问题长期拖延不决，引起全世界的关注，巴解组织为尽早解决这一难题，它一方面坚持对被占领土起义的领导，反抗以色列当局的镇压，另一方面积极展开外交攻势，希望通过有关各方的对话和协商，寻求巴勒斯坦问题和平解决的途径。去年年底开始的美巴对话，是巴解组织进行外交努力所取得的一个成果。接着，阿拉法特访问西班牙，同欧共体进行正式接触，积极推动西欧为解决巴勒斯坦问题而展开行动。阿拉法特最近对法国的访问就是这种努力的延续。
    作为欧共体的一个重要成员，法国对巴勒斯坦问题特别关心。早在７０年代初，法国在联合国就投票支持承认“巴勒斯坦人权”的决议。法国还是首先以官方身份接见巴勒斯坦领导人的西方国家。密特朗总统在与阿拉法特会谈时强调巴勒斯坦人“拥有一个国家的权利”，就第一次对巴解组织给予明确而积极的支持。人们还注意到，法国将于７月１日接任欧共体主席，这就赋予它对推动中东国际和会的召开，促使巴以直接对话，负有直接的责任。此外，它同以色列也保持良好关系。法国的特殊地位决定它在解决巴勒斯坦问题上能发挥特殊的作用，对加速中东和平进程是有益的。
    巴解同欧洲国家的接近，在斗争策略上的日趋灵活，迫使美国也相应地调整自己的政策。美巴的直接对话，从过去明显偏袒以色列转而“使巴解和以色列或多或少地处于并列的地位”，表明美国也在为中东局势的缓和而努力。然而，这种种努力收效甚微，其原因在于以色列在中东问题上仍然坚持顽固立场。因此，要求美国对以色列施加压力，促其迅速改变态度，无疑是打破当前中东和谈僵局的关键。阿拉伯国家与欧共体国家在这一点上目标应该是一致的。
