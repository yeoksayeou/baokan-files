In West Germany, there are over 3 million people aged 65 and above, among whom approximately 150,000 are cared for in more than 6,000 elderly homes. To better care for the elderly, in recent years, some companies, unions, adult education institutions, and social welfare organizations have jointly established elderly care schools.

The curriculum at elderly care schools lasts two years. The first year includes 1,200 hours of theoretical study and 400 to 500 hours of practical training. The second year focuses more on practical training. Theoretical courses cover subjects such as arts, medicine, gerontology, and sports. Practical courses are usually conducted in elderly homes, where students learn and master skills such as haircutting, bathing, dressing, feeding, administering medication, assisting with walking, and pushing wheelchairs. Additionally, students learn how to organize cultural activities for the elderly and techniques for comforting them.

Upon completing the two-year program, students must pass a national examination to receive a graduation certificate. After graduation, finding employment is relatively easy, as elderly homes, elderly clubs, and elderly social welfare associations all require such professionals. Statistics show that West Germany has about 4,000 students studying in elderly care schools each year, but this still cannot meet the societal demand.

　　老人护理学校
    联邦德国现有６５岁的老人３００万以上，其中约有１５万人在６０００多所老人院受到照料。为了更好的照顾老人，近年来，一些公司、工会、成人教育机构、社会福利组织联合开办了老人护理学校。
    老人护理学校学制两年。第一年有１２００小时的理论学习，４００至５００小时的实践课，第二年则偏重实践。理论课设有艺术、医学、老年心理学、体育等；实践课一般到老人院去上，学习掌握理发、洗澡、穿衣喂食、吃药打针、挽扶行走或推轮椅等护理技术。另外，还要学会如何安排老人的文化生活以及安慰老人的技巧。
    两年学习结束后，学员必须经国家考试合格后才可获得毕业证书。毕业后就业非常容易，因老人院、老人俱乐部、老人社会福利协会等都需要这方面人才。据统计，联邦德国每年约有４０００人在老年护理学校学习，但仍不能满足社会需要。
