People's Daily, Beijing, May 6, 1989

On April 16, seven journalists from the Chinese Journalists Association, Xinhua News Agency, and this newspaper boarded the 310th train from Huaihua, Hunan Province, to Dayong. When the train passed through Jishou City, several "dashing youths" boarded the 12th car. One of them, shortly after boarding, boldly reached into the pocket of a journalist named Xiao Yang, who had hung his jacket on a hook, and stole 50 yuan. Old Wang from the Chinese Journalists Association quickly accompanied Xiao Yang to find the money and discovered that the thief was drinking high-end beverages with three other "dashing youths."

Xiao Yang shouted and grabbed the thief who was trying to escape. Another "dashing youth" came over to pull the thief away, claiming that he had lost his cigarettes and wanted to "take over" the thief from Xiao Yang. Several other journalists nearby quickly stood up and surrounded them, helping Xiao Yang hold onto the thief's arm. In the struggle, a knife fell from the thief's body.

At this point, the train's police officer, summoned by Old Wang, immediately took the thief and the knife to the dining car. After questioning, the thief admitted to stealing the money.

The train conductor, Old Huang, told the journalists that the order on the railway from Changsha to Dayong is very chaotic. There are many reasons for this disorder. From the perspective of the railway itself, the service quality is poor. From a social environment perspective, every train on this route can catch thieves, ranging from three to five, up to twenty or more. These thieves are mostly young people who operate in groups, stealing during the day and robbing at night. Generally, passengers, for their own safety, often do not intervene as long as they are not targeted.

Some train attendants also fear being harmed, and when incidents occur, they only run to find the police. However, there are only three police officers per train. With so many cars, they can't cover everything. If they catch a thief, they can only temporarily detain them in the dining car. Upon arriving at the station, they are handed over to the station's police office. After a lecture, the thieves are released. As a result, after a few days, the thieves are back on the train.

The journalists observed that there were also genuine and fake disabled beggars on this train. A man with a disabled leg, after collecting money, found a seat, took out a bottle of beer from his bag, and began to drink leisurely.

Passengers generally felt that the Xiangxi Railway passenger cars must be rectified and managed, and criminals should not be allowed to roam freely on the trains.

　　湘西铁路乘车记
    本报记者  王溪元
    ４月１６日，中国记协、新华社、本报等单位的７名记者乘３１０次火车由湖南省怀化市去大庸市。车过吉首市时，记者乘坐的１２号车厢上来几个“倜傥少年”，其中一个上车后不久公然把手伸进记者小杨挂在衣帽钩上的上衣兜里，偷走了５０元钱。中国记协的老王忙陪小杨去找钱，发现那个小偷正同另外三个“倜傥少年”在大喝高级饮料。
    小杨大吼一声，上去一把抓住那个急于逃避的掏兜者。这时，另外一个“倜傥少年”上来忙拉扯掏兜者，说是丢了香烟，想从小杨手里把掏兜者“接管”过去。坐在附近的其他几名记者见势，急忙站起来围上去，帮助小杨抓住掏兜者的手臂。撕扭中，“当啷”一声，小偷身上掉下一把刀子。
    这时，列车乘警已被记协老王找来，当即将小偷和那把刀子带到餐车里。经过审问，小偷承认了偷钱。
    列车长老黄对记者说，长沙至大庸的铁路秩序很乱。乱的原因很多，从铁路自身来说，服务质量较差。从社会环境来看，这一带哪趟车都能抓住小偷，少则三五个，多则２０来个。这些小偷多是青少年，成群结伙，白天偷，夜里抢。一般旅客为了个人安全，往往是只要不偷到自己身上便不管。
    有些列车员也怕受害，遇事只是跑去找乘警。但一趟车只有３个乘警。这么多车厢，顾了前边顾不了后边，假如抓住了小偷，只能把他们暂时关在餐车里，到了车站，交给车站派出所。派出所教育一通，还得放。结果是过不了几天，小偷在车上又同大伙见面了。
    记者观察，这趟车还有真假残疾人乞讨。一个残腿者，要钱转过一圈之后，找了个座位坐下，从随身带的提包里掏出一瓶啤酒，颇为自在地细酌慢饮起来。
    乘客普遍反映，湘西铁路客车必须治理、整顿，不能再让歹徒在车上横行无阻了。
