New China News Agency, Beijing, May 18th. Premier Li Peng met this afternoon with Chinese and foreign representatives attending the Fourth World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education in Zhongnanhai. He extended a warm welcome on behalf of the Chinese government to the representatives from five continents.

Li Peng said that as an engineer, he fully understands the importance of continuing education. With the rapid development of science and technology, the knowledge acquired in school is far from sufficient. Therefore, the necessity of continuing education is obvious. Both developing and developed countries need to attach importance to continuing education to achieve development.

Li Peng congratulated the "International Association for Continuing Engineering Education" on its establishment in Beijing yesterday and wished the conference a complete success.

Dr. Stanberg, former vice president of Lockheed in the United States, expressed gratitude on behalf of the foreign guests for the efforts made by the Chinese side in organizing the conference. He believed that this conference would help deepen understanding and cooperation with Chinese friends in the field of science and technology.

State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission Song Jian and others were present at the meeting.

The three-day World Conference on Continuing Engineering Education opened yesterday. More than 500 experts, scholars, entrepreneurs, and government officials from 47 countries and regions participated in the conference.
