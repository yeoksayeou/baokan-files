Deserts have long been seen as desolate and bleak death zones. Yet today, they are producing golden grains, fresh vegetables, and delicious fruits. The human dream of turning deserts into oases is becoming a reality.

News from the Desert Kingdom

The oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a desert country. However, the once barren lands cut through by the Rub' al Khali and Nafud deserts are now covered with dense palm trees and lush crops. Ten years ago, Saudi Arabia's annual wheat production was less than 3,500 tons, but by 1987, it had surged to 2.5 million tons. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization highly praised this achievement, stating, "No country in the 1980s has achieved such tremendous progress as Saudi Arabia."

Egypt, once the granary of the Roman Empire, has 96% of its territory as desert. To address population growth and food shortages, Egypt has built multiple new towns and over 500 new villages in the desert. By the year 2000, an additional 450 similar new villages are expected to rise in the desert.

The Negev Desert in Israel, previously considered unsuitable for habitation, now houses nearly 500,000 people. The cotton yield per unit area here exceeds that of California in the United States and Egypt. The peanut yield per unit area is four times higher than in some U.S. states.

Even countries not traditionally associated with deserts, such as Japan and the United States, are conducting experiments in desert agriculture. A Japanese research team has cultivated almost all types of vegetables in the Mexican desert. Scientists are confident that research in desert agriculture has brought new hope to humanity.

Computer-Controlled Irrigation Systems

Water is the key to farming in deserts. Scientists have developed computer-controlled "spray irrigation" and "drip irrigation" systems. Currently, spray irrigation is the most widely used. It can evenly distribute water and effectively control water usage. The Sarhiya Farm in Egypt, a modern demonstration area for desert reclamation, uses a large-scale, automatic-controlled vertical shaft spray irrigation system.

Drip irrigation has brought significant changes to desert agriculture. Currently, one-third of Israel's irrigated areas use drip irrigation methods: water flows through plastic pipes to the plant's roots, and the fine holes in the plastic pipes drip water like eye drops. The computer determines the number of water droplets based on the air temperature, humidity, and wind speed, and adds fertilizer as needed. This method avoids salt damage to leaves and cuts off the water source for pests. Compared to traditional methods, it can save over 50% of water and energy, as well as pesticides and fertilizers. The American Horticultural Society considers this automated desert agriculture drip irrigation technology to be "one of the most significant advancements in grain production in nearly a century." Currently, parts of the arid regions in the United States, Brazil, and South Korea also use drip irrigation technology, increasing crop yields by more than onefold.

Japanese scientists are also researching new methods, such as using water-retaining agents to eliminate salt damage to plant roots, using fiber fabrics for shading, and using surface covering materials to control soil water evaporation. The success and promotion of these experiments will significantly reduce the production costs of desert agriculture.

Genetically Engineered Varieties

Breeding new agricultural and livestock varieties suitable for desert regions is a major task for desert agriculture. Israel is at the forefront of this research. It has conducted severe tests such as burial, salinization, sun exposure, and flooding on many crop varieties, breeding crops suitable for desert growth. It has also used genetic engineering methods to breed tomatoes that can stay fresh for a month without refrigeration, perennial onions, roses that can withstand low temperatures, shrubs that can be irrigated with seawater, and sheep that feed on these shrubs. Notably, it has bred a dwarf peach tree, with each tree producing as much fruit as 160 ordinary peach trees. Now, the Negev Desert agricultural region exports large quantities of fruits, flowers, and vegetables to European countries.

Desert agriculture is also an effective way to control desertification. Currently, about 35% of the Earth's land area is facing the threat of desertification. The famine caused by desertification directly threatens the survival of 850 million people. Therefore, the rise of desert agriculture has shown humanity a broad prospect.

### 沙漠农业带来的希望

　　沙漠农业带来的希望
    何崇元
    沙漠，历来被人们看成是荒凉凄黯的死亡之海。可今天，它竟然生产出了金黄的粮食、新鲜的蔬菜和可口的水果。人类变沙漠为绿洲的梦想开始成为现实。
  来自沙漠之国的信息
    石油王国沙特阿拉伯是沙漠之国。但是，昔日被鲁卜哈利沙漠、大小内夫得沙漠横切竖割的荒野，现在已被茂密的棕榈树和绿油油的庄稼覆盖。１０年前沙特阿拉伯的小麦年产量还不足３５００吨，１９８７年，则猛增到２５０万吨。联合国粮农组织对此高度评价说：“世界上没有一个国家在８０年代像它那样取得如此巨大的成就。”
    曾经是罗马帝国粮仓的埃及，国土的９６％是沙漠。为解决人口增长和粮食短缺，埃及在沙漠中建成多座小城和５００多个新村，到２０００年，还将有４５０个类似的新村在沙漠中崛起。
    过去，被认为不适于居住的以色列内格夫沙漠，如今居住着近５０万人，这里棉花的单位面积产量超过了美国的加利福尼亚和埃及；花生的单位面积产量比美国一些州高４倍。
    远非沙漠之国的日本、美国也在进行沙漠农业的试验。日本的研究小组在墨西哥沙漠里栽培了几乎所有种类的蔬菜。科学家们确信，沙漠农业的研究已给人类带来新的希望。
  计算机控制的灌溉系统
    沙漠种田，水是关键。科学家们已研究出电子计算机控制的“喷灌”和“滴灌”系统。目前喷灌应用最广。它能均匀分布水份，有效地控制用水量。埃及的萨里海亚农场，是改造沙漠的现代化示范垦区，用的就是自动控制的大型立轴喷灌系统。
    滴灌给沙漠农业带来了不小的变化。现在以色列１／３的灌溉面积采用了滴灌方法：水经过塑料管道流到植物旁边，塑料管上的细孔把微咸水像点眼药水那样点到植物根部。计算机根据空气的温度、湿度和风速来确定水滴数量，同时根据需要加肥料。这样，既避免盐份烧叶子，又切断了害虫的水源。和传统方法比，它可节省５０％以上的用水和能源，还可节省农药、化肥。美国园艺科学会认为，这套自动化沙漠农业滴灌技术是“近百年来粮食生产方面有重要意义的进展之一。”目前，美国、巴西和南朝鲜的部分干旱地区，也采用滴灌技术，农作物产量增加一倍以上。
    日本科学家还正在研究一些新的办法，比如，用保水剂消除作物根部盐害；用纤维织物遮荫；用表土覆盖材料控制土壤水份蒸发。这些试验的成功与推广，将会大幅度降低沙漠农业的生产成本。
  遗传工程培育的品种
    培育适合于在沙漠地区生长的农畜新品种是沙漠农业的重大课题。以色列在这方面的研究居领先地位。它对许多农作物品种进行了掩埋、盐渍、日晒、浸淹等严酷试验，培育出适宜于沙漠生长的农作物，还应用遗传工程方法培育了不冷藏就能保鲜一月的番茄、多年生长的洋葱、能经受低温的玫瑰、完全用海水灌溉的灌木丛以及以这种灌木丛为饲料的羊种。特别是它培育出一种矮桃树，每棵的结果数量相当于１６０棵通常的桃树。现在，内格夫沙漠农业区生产的水果、花卉和蔬菜已大量向欧洲国家出口。
    　　　　　　
    沙漠农业还是控制沙漠化的一个有效途径。目前，约有３５％的地球陆地面积已面临沙漠化的危机。沙漠化带来的饥荒已直接威胁到８．５亿人的生存。因此，沙漠农业的兴起，为人类展示了广阔的前景。
