Soviet Foreign Minister Warns West Not to Update Short-Range Missiles, Otherwise the Soviet Union Will Develop New Missile Systems

	Bonn, May 14 (Xinhua) - Correspondent Jiang Jinguo reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned yesterday in this city that the West should not make a decision to modernize short-range missiles. He said that if NATO updates its short-range nuclear weapons, the Soviet Union will either stop the destruction of SS-23 missiles or develop new missile systems.

	Shevardnadze made these remarks at a press conference at the end of his visit to West Germany. He said that the key issue of the United States' insistence on updating short-range nuclear missiles is to avoid the US-Soviet intermediate-range missile agreement. He advocated for separate negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons outside the Vienna negotiations on conventional forces in Europe. He said the Soviet government is ready to negotiate on all issues with the West. He also elaborated on the details of the latest Soviet-proposed arms control agreement.

	Gorbachev will officially visit West Germany in June. West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said at a press conference yesterday that the text of the political declaration and various agreements to be signed during Gorbachev's visit to West Germany are ready. He said that a satisfactory solution has been found regarding the issue of incorporating West Berlin into the bilateral agreement. Shevardnadze said that the solution agreed upon by both sides will be beneficial to European countries and residents of West Berlin.

	Yesterday morning, Genscher and Shevardnadze also signed an agreement on West German aid for the reconstruction of the Armenian earthquake-stricken area. Shevardnadze departed for Moscow via Cologne yesterday afternoon.

	Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 13 - Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze announced today here for the first time that the Soviet Union can agree to the destruction of short-range nuclear warheads that have been announced to be withdrawn.

	Shevardnadze, at a press conference at the end of his visit to Bonn, said that the Soviet Union is prepared to agree to the destruction of 500 short-range nuclear warheads withdrawn from Eastern Europe and is currently consulting with other Eastern European countries on the specific methods of destruction. Previously, the Soviet Union had only expressed its intention to withdraw short-range nuclear warheads to Soviet territory.

	Shevardnadze also announced that the Soviet Union is prepared to propose to the participating countries of the Vienna arms control talks in the coming weeks to reach the following upper limits on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces and armaments within the next two years: 1.35 million personnel each; 1,500 tactical air combat aircraft each; 1,700 combat helicopters each; 20,000 tanks each; 24,000 artillery pieces of various types each; and 28,000 armored personnel carriers each. The foreign minister said that the Soviet Union believes that the West's reasons for demanding short-range modernization are untenable. Although Eastern Europe has conventional superiority, the Soviet Union is already prepared to establish "complete parity" in forces and armaments.

　　苏外长警告西方勿更新短导  否则苏将研制新式导弹系统
    本报波恩５月１４日电  记者江建国报道：苏联外交部长谢瓦尔德纳泽昨天在此间警告西方不要作出使短程导弹现代化的决定。他说，如果北约更新短程核武器，苏联要么停止销毁ＳＳ—２３导弹，要么将同样研制新式导弹系统。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽是昨天在结束他对西德访问时说这番话的。他在记者招待会上说，美国执意更新短程核导弹的要害实际上是回避美苏中导协议。他赞成东西方在维也纳欧洲常规军备力量谈判之外举行关于短程核武器的单独谈判。他说苏联政府准备就所有问题与西方谈判。他还阐述了苏联最新提出的裁军协议的细节。
    戈尔巴乔夫将于６月正式访问西德。西德外长根舍昨天在记者招待会上说，戈尔巴乔夫访问西德时，双方将要签署的政治声明文本和各项协议已准备就绪。他说，有关西柏林纳入双边协议问题已经找出了满意的解决办法。谢瓦尔德纳泽说，双方一致同意的解决办法将有利于欧洲国家和西柏林居民。
    昨天上午根舍外长和谢瓦尔德纳泽外长还签署了一项西德援助重建亚美尼亚地震灾区的协定。谢瓦尔德纳泽昨天下午经科隆返莫斯科。
    新华社波恩５月１３日电　苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽今天在这里首次宣布，苏联可以同意销毁已宣布准备撤回的短程核弹头。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽在结束对波恩访问时举行的记者招待会上说，苏联准备同意销毁从东欧撤回的５００枚短导核弹头，并正在与东欧其他国家就销毁这些弹头的具体的方法进行磋商。在此之前，苏联只表示将短导核弹头撤回苏联本土。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽还宣布，苏联准备在今后几个星期内向维也纳裁军谈判的与会国建议，在今后两年内就北约和华约的部队和军备达成下述共同上限：兵员各为１３５万人；战术空军战斗机各为１５００架；战斗直升机各为１７００架；坦克各为２００００辆；各类火炮各为２４０００门；步兵战车各为２８０００辆。这位外长说，苏联认为西方要求短导现代化的理由是站不脚的。东欧虽然拥有常规优势，但苏联已经准备就部队和军备建立“完全的均势”。
