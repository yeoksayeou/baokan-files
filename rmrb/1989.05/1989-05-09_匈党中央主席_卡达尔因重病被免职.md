János Kádár, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, has been relieved of his duties due to serious illness.

BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) — János Kádár, chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, has been relieved of his duties due to serious illness, according to a decision made today at a meeting of the party's Central Committee.

The decision was made in light of Kádár's health condition, according to a report by the Hungarian News Agency. The Central Committee will notify Kádár in writing and make the decision public.

Kádár was born in 1912 in a poor family in Hungary. He worked as an apprentice and a worker and joined the Hungarian Communist Party in 1931. During the reactionary rule of Horthy, he was arrested and imprisoned multiple times. In 1943, he became a secretary of the party's Central Committee. After liberation, he held various important positions within the party and the government. During the period of personal cult under Rákosi, he was persecuted and imprisoned until his release in 1953. In October 1956, following the Hungarian events, he became the first secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and the prime minister of the revolutionary government of workers and peasants. Over the next 30-plus years, he remained a key leader of the Hungarian party. At the party's representative conference held last May, Kádár was elected as the party chairman.

In recent days, Hungarian party leaders have repeatedly mentioned that Kádár's health condition is very poor.

The Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party also decided to convene a national representative conference in the near future. The date will be determined by the next Central Committee meeting.

　　匈党中央主席
    卡达尔因重病被免职
    新华社布达佩斯５月８日电  （记者邹国昌）匈牙利社会主义工人党主席卡达尔·亚诺什因患重病，今天在这里被免去党主席的职务。
    这是今天举行的匈党中央全会决定的，据匈通社报道，全会鉴于卡达尔的健康状况，决定免去他的党主席和中央委员职务。中央委员会将把这一决定书面通知卡达尔并将公布。
    卡达尔１９１２年５月生于匈牙利一个穷苦的家庭，当过学徒和工人，１９３１年参加匈牙利共产党。在霍尔蒂反动统治时期曾多次被捕入狱，１９４３年任党中央书记。解放后在党内和政府中担任过各种重要职务。在拉科西个人迷信时期曾受迫害被捕入狱，直到１９５３年才被释放。１９５６年１０月匈牙利事件后，他任匈牙利社会主义工人党中央第一书记和工农革命政府总理。在以后的３０多年中，他一直是匈党的主要领导人。在去年５月召开的党的代表会议上，卡达尔当选为党的主席。
    近日来，匈党领导人多次谈到卡达尔的健康状况很不佳。
    匈党中央全会还决定近期内召开党的全国代表会议，日期由下次中央全会决定。
