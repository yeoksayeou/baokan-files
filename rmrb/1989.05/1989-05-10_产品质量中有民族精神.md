The reputation of export-oriented enterprises and foreign trade companies in the international market is influenced by various factors, such as the quality of exported goods, whether the prices are reasonable, whether the delivery is timely, and whether the service is attentive. However, among these factors, the quality of exported goods is paramount.

International market-leading brands share a common characteristic: they strive for perfection in quality, leaving no room for criticism. Even the most meticulous scrutiny would struggle to find faults. Once, during a visit to a renowned sports shoe factory abroad, we observed workers discarding a shoe with a tiny speck of dust on the glued sole. When asked for the reason, the factory manager explained, "This speck of dust could potentially cause the sole to peel off. If our shoes, once purchased by customers, start peeling, even just once, it could ruin our brand's reputation." This attitude reflects a strong competitive spirit and a high sense of professional responsibility. Customer trust in branded products stems from this dedication. However, in China, we often lack this spirit when it comes to quality control. For instance, exported garments frequently have sloppy stitching, untrimmed threads, oil stains, and careless ironing. At export product exhibitions, one often finds: duck-billed thermos flasks that are decently made but paired with a crude cap; a piano with a decent sound but a couple of keys lacking the same springiness as the others; a well-designed and crafted women's backpack equipped with rusty metal fittings, and so on. Many products, upon close inspection, reveal some flaws. Some high-quality materials end up being downgraded to low-grade or "street vendor" goods due to these minor defects.

When it comes to export products, emphasizing quality from a general economic and technical perspective is insufficient. Instead, we should prioritize the quality of export goods from the standpoint of national spirit and responsibility. Any product bearing the label "MADE IN CHINA" should be of high quality and completely reliable. Therefore, to revitalize China's export trade, we must first uphold our national spirit, ensuring meticulousness and perfection in our work and products. We should regard sloppiness, poor quality, and counterfeit goods as personal and national shame.

Improving the quality of export products is not an easy task. We need to change our mindset and address several issues:

We must change the mindset that overlooks the quality of appearance and packaging. While focusing on the internal quality of products, we should also enhance the quality of appearance and packaging. During a Canton Fair, a foreign merchant familiar with Chinese goods told our staff, "Your soap quality is good, but with such simple packaging, it won't even sell on our street markets, let alone in our department stores."

We must change the mindset that prioritizes sample quality over batch production quality. Many foreign merchants have noted that some Chinese factories produce samples meticulously, but fail to maintain consistent quality in batch production, resulting in fluctuating quality that affects China's international reputation.

We must change the mindset that overlooks trademarks and fails to protect their reputation, and properly handle the relationship between trademarks and quality. Trademarks are not just identifiers for different manufacturers of the same product; they are more importantly indicators of product quality, standards, and reputation. Some factories do not pay attention to trademark reputation, treating it casually, ultimately harming themselves.

We must change the mindset that quality can be compromised for mid-to-low-end products. High, mid, and low-end products all have their own quality standards, and mid-to-low-end products should not be mistakenly perceived as low-quality products. The era of winning in the international market by selling low-priced, low-quality goods or by prioritizing quantity over quality has long passed.

We should address product quality issues from the perspective of national spirit. From product research, development, and design to production, assembly, packaging, storage, and transportation, every step should embody the Chinese spirit of meticulousness and pursuit of perfection, ensuring quality and striving for brand recognition, thereby enhancing the reputation of Chinese goods in the international market.

### 产品质量中有民族精神

　　产品质量中有民族精神
    经贸部副部长  李岚清
    出口生产企业和外贸企业在国际市场上的信誉包含多种因素，如出口商品质量的优劣，价格是否合理，交货是否及时，服务是否周到等。但在诸多因素中，出口商品的质量则居首位。
    国际市场上的名牌有一个共同的特点，就是在质量上精益求精，一丝不苟，即使你怎么挑剔也难以挑出它的毛病来。有一次，在国外参观一个名牌运动鞋生产厂时，看到工人把一只粘有一点小灰粒的涂胶鞋底当做废品挑出，当我们问原因时，厂长回答说：“这个灰粒就可能成为鞋底脱胶的祸根，如果我们的鞋被顾客买去后脱了胶，即使有一次也可能就会砸了我们的牌子。”这种精神是一种强烈的竞争意识和高度职业责任感的结合。人们对名牌产品信任感也是来源于此。但是，我国在抓产品质量上却缺乏这种精神。例如，出口服装往往是缝制不精细，线头不修剪，油污和熨整马虎等等。在出口产品展销会上，常会发现：鸭嘴式热水瓶做得还算可以，但配上一个十分粗糙的鸭嘴盖；一架钢琴音色还不错，但有两个键已缺乏弹力而同其它键不一般平了；一个造型和制作比较美观的女式背包，却装上生了锈的金属配件，等等。许许多多的产品，仔细看一看总能挑出一些毛病来。有些是用上等材料制成的产品，往往由于这些产品上的“小毛病”，而被沦为低级货或“地摊货”。
    对待出口产品来说，从一般经济技术意义上来强调质量问题是不够的，而应首先从民族精神和责任感的高度来强调出口商品的质量问题。只要在商标上有“ＭＡＤＥＩＮＣＨＩＮＡ”几个字，就应该是高质量的商品和可以完全信赖的商品。因此，要振兴我国的出口贸易，首先要弘扬我们的民族精神，对待工作，对待自己的产品，要做到一丝不苟，精益求精。要把工作马虎、质量粗糙、掺假伪劣，当作自己的耻辱，当作我们中华民族的耻辱。
    提高出口产品质量当然不是举手可得的事。我们需要在以下几个方面转变观念，处理好关系。
    转变轻视外观质量和包装质量的观念，在抓好产品内在质量的同时，把外观质量和包装质量搞上去。在一次广州交易会上，一位熟悉中国商品的外商对我方人员说，你们中国的香皂质量不错，但这样简陋的包装，不要说上我们百货公司的货架，就是放在地摊上也很难出售。
    要转变只重视样品的质量而忽视批量生产的质量问题。不少外商反映，我国一些工厂提供样品时往往是做得还比较精细，而一旦批量供货时则不能保证质量，或时好时差，很不稳定，影响了我国商品的国际信誉。
    要转变忽视商标和不注意维护商标信誉的倾向，处理好商标与质量的关系。商标不只是区别不同厂家生产的同一种商品的标志，而更重要的是产品质量、水平和信誉的标志。我们有些工厂很不注意商标的信誉，很随便，结果倒霉的还是自己。
    要转变认为中低档产品的质量就可以马虎的观念，高、中、低档产品都有各自的质量标准，更不能笼统地把中、低档产品理解为低质产品。那种靠卖价廉低质商品或以量代质的方针而在国际市场上取胜的时代早已过去了。
    我们应当从民族精神的高度来对待产品质量问题。从产品的研究、开发、设计，到生产制造、装配，到包装、储存、运输等所有环节，都要体现我们中华民族做事的一丝不苟、精益求精的精神，确保质量，争创名牌，使中国货在国际市场上信誉日增。
