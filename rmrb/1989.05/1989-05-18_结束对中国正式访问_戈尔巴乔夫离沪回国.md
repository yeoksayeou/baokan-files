    Our reporter Zhang Yunwen reports from Shanghai: The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev, and his wife, along with their entourage, concluded their four-day visit to China today. At 6:45 PM, they departed Shanghai by special plane to return home.

    Vice Premier Wu Xueqian, Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen, Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary Jiang Zemin, and Mayor Zhu Rongji were at the airport to see them off.

    Gorbachev asked Vice Premier Wu Xueqian to convey his message to the Chinese leadership: "I am very satisfied with this visit. Although the time was short, we have completed the most important task, which is to normalize the relations between the two countries. As for the current situation in China, I sincerely hope that it can be eased and resolved."

    Wu Xueqian said he would convey Gorbachev's words. He believed that Gorbachev was satisfied with this visit. He wished Gorbachev and the Soviet delegation a safe journey.

    Gorbachev and his wife Raisa arrived in Shanghai by special plane at 1:00 PM today.

    Shanghai Municipal Party Secretary Jiang Zemin and Mayor Zhu Rongji were at the airport to welcome the Soviet dignitaries. Vice Premier Wu Xueqian and Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen, who had accompanied Gorbachev on his visit to Shanghai, were also at the airport to welcome them.

    After stepping off the plane, Gorbachev was greeted by two Chinese children who presented him with flowers. Gorbachev affectionately said, "Thank you, children!"

    The caravan carrying Gorbachev and his entourage from the airport to the hotel was greeted by crowds shouting "Welcome" and applauding enthusiastically. When the caravan passed by the Shanghai Zoo, Gorbachev and his wife got out of the car and waved to the enthusiastic crowd.

    In the afternoon, Jiang Zemin met with Gorbachev at the Xijiao Guesthouse. Jiang Zemin said, "Because of your visit, the weather in Shanghai has improved." Gorbachev replied, "What is especially gratifying is that the weather in Sino-Soviet relations has improved."

    Jiang Zemin mentioned that at the end of last year, Shanghai and Leningrad signed an agreement to establish sister cities. When introducing the situation in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin summarized it in two sentences: "Hope and difficulty coexist, and opportunities and challenges go hand in hand."

    Gorbachev expressed his gratitude for Shanghai's warm reception. He said, "The past few days have been historic. Sino-Soviet relations have entered a new stage, reaching a new level, giving our relations new substance and new content."

    Later, Mayor Zhu Rongji hosted a banquet in honor of the Soviet dignitaries.

    戈尔巴乔夫请吴学谦副总理向中国领导人转达：我对这次访问非常满意。这次访问虽然时间很短，但是完成了一件最重要的任务，这就是使两国关系正常化。至于中国现在出现的局势，我诚心诚意地希望能够缓和下来，能够得到解决。
