	Beijing Students Submit Petition on Dialogue Issues with 12 Demands and 4 Declarations

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 3rd: It is learned from the central petitioning authorities that on the 2nd, dozens of students from universities in the capital submitted a "petition" to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The petition has 12 demands. The full text of the petition is as follows:

	After the "April 27th" march, the government expressed its willingness to engage in dialogue with students through the media. We welcome this sincerely. To facilitate the early realization of substantive dialogue, we, as representatives elected by the majority, represent the students of universities in Beijing, and put forward the following requirements regarding dialogue to the government and the Party Central Committee:

	1. The dialogue should be based on complete equality and a sincere desire to solve problems. The opportunities for speaking and questioning should be equal in the dialogue.

	2. The student representatives participating in the dialogue should be recognized by the majority of university students (especially the university students participating in this April patriotic democratic movement). At the same time, we believe that, given that the student unions and graduate student unions of various universities have not played any correct guiding or beneficial organizational role in this movement, we absolutely do not agree to have student representatives appointed by various university student unions and graduate student unions, nor do we recognize student representatives privately invited by the government without the consent of the majority of students.

	3. We propose the following method for the composition of student representatives: Given that the Beijing Municipal Federation of University Student Self-Governance, which was spontaneously organized by students, has been playing a leading and organizational role in this movement and has been recognized by the majority of students, it can be organized by the Municipal Federation of University Student Self-Governance to contact and organize representatives from various universities in the capital according to the proportion of the number of students to form a student representative delegation. After full discussion and consultation within the delegation, several student representatives are elected as the overall spokespersons for the student side, and other representatives have the right to attend and listen, and to supplement and consult on the student side's statements, and to raise questions to the government side's spokespersons.

	4. The government side's participants in the dialogue should be members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, vice chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and vice premiers or above, who have the knowledge of various national affairs and decision-making authority.

	5. The dialogue must allow the representatives of civil organizations or individuals invited by both sides to attend, and neither side can refuse or obstruct for any reason. The invited representatives do not have the right to speak during the dialogue but have the right to express their views on the content of the dialogue afterwards.

	6. Both sides' spokespersons must have the right to speak equally. Each speech by both sides' spokespersons must be limited in time, with questions limited to 3 minutes and answers limited to 10-15 minutes, allowing spokespersons to ask multiple questions during the question-and-answer session.

	7. The dialogue process must allow domestic and foreign journalists to conduct on-site interviews and reporting, and the Central Television and Central People's Radio Station should broadcast the entire dialogue process live. Both sides of the dialogue have the right to film, record, and take notes on-site, and no organization or individual may interfere or obstruct for any reason.

	8. The dialogue should be held alternately at the designated venues of the government and student representatives, and the time can be determined through consultation by both sides.

	9. Government participants in the dialogue should try to answer and solve problems that can be answered and solved during the dialogue. If certain problems cannot be answered immediately, a time limit can be set for the next round of dialogue, and neither side may unreasonably refuse.

	10. To ensure the legal effect of the dialogue results, both sides of the dialogue must issue a joint announcement on the dialogue results and sign it jointly to prove it.

	11. The personal and political safety of the representatives of both sides of the dialogue must be guaranteed.

	12. After each round of dialogue, the results must be reported truthfully in major national newspapers and radio stations, and an announcement must be issued, and the time and place of the next round of dialogue must be announced.

	Regarding the above requirements, we declare the following:

	1. To ensure that the dialogue is realized as soon as possible, we hope that the above requirements will be answered by 12:00 noon on May 3rd, and on the basis of specific answers to specific requirements, the reasons for the answers to each item will be attached to form a written document.

	2. If we do not receive an answer by 12:00 noon on May 3rd, we reserve the right to continue to march and petition on May 4th.

	3. Regarding the first round of dialogue, we suggest that it be held at 8:30 AM on May 4th, and the venue can be set at Peking University.

	4. This petition will be sent to the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

　　北京部分大学生递交请愿书    
    就对话问题提出１２条要求４点声明
    新华社北京５月３日电  记者从中央信访部门获悉，首都高校数十名学生２日递交的给全国人大常委会、国务院和中共中央的“请愿书”共有１２条。“请愿书”全文如下：
    在“四·二七”游行之后，政府通过新闻媒介表达了愿与学生进行对话的愿望，对此我们表示衷心的欢迎，为促成尽快达成实质性的对话，我们作为大家推选的代表，代表北京市高校广大同学，向政府和党中央提出我们关于对话的要求如下：
    一、对话双方应建立在完全平等，真诚地解决问题的基础之上。在对话中，发言、质疑的机会应均等。
    二、参加对话的学生代表应该由大多数高校学生（特别是参加此次四月爱国民主运动的高校学生）公认推出。同时我们认为，鉴于各高校学生会、研究生会在这次运动中没有起到任何正确的引导和有益的组织作用，因此我们绝不同意由各高校学生会、研究生会指派学生代表，也绝不承认由政府单方面未经广大同学的同意而私下邀请的学生充当学生代表。
    三、我们提出学生代表组成方式如下：鉴于同学自发组织产生的北京市高校学生自治联合会在这次运动中一直起领导组织作用，并且在广大同学中获得了认可，可以由市高联出面联络组织，由首都各高校学生根据人数多少的比例各推出若干名代表组成学生代表团。在代表团内部经充分讨论磋商后，从中推举出若干名学生代表作为学生一方总发言人，其他代表具有列席旁听，并对学生方面的发言作协商补充，及向政府方面发言人提出质疑的权利。
    四、政府方面出席对话的人员，应为中共中央政治局常委、全国人大常委会副委员长、国务院副总理级别以上，具有了解国家各种事务及决策权利的人员。
    五、对话必须允许双方邀请的民间人士或团体的代表参加旁听，任何一方不能以任何理由拒绝或阻拦。被邀请代表在对话过程中不具有发言权，但具有事后就对话内容发表看法的权利。
    六、双方发言人必须有发言机会均等的权利。双方发言人每次发言必须限定时间，质疑应限定在３分钟以内，答问应限定在１０—１５分钟之内，允许发言人在问答中多次质疑。
    七、对话过程中必须允许中外记者现场采访报道，同时中央电视台、中央人民广播电台应现场直播全部对话过程。对话双方均具有现场摄像录音和记录的权利，任何团体或个人不得以任何借口加以干涉和阻挠。
    八、对话应在政府和学生代表分别指定的地点轮流举行，时间可由双方协商确定。
    九、政府参加对话人员在对话过程中应尽量回答并在会后尽量解决可以回答和解决的问题。如果某些问题确实不能迅即答复，可商定在限定的时间内举行下一轮对话，任何一方不得无理拒绝。
    十、为保证对话结果的法律效力，对话双方必须对对话结果出具联合公告，并经双方共同签字证明。
    十一、必须保证对话双方代表的人身和政治安全。
    十二、每一轮对话之后，必须在国家各大报纸及电台上如实报道结果，出具公告，并宣布下一轮对话的时间、地点等事宜。
    关于以上要求，我们声明如下：
    一、为确保对话尽快达成，对以上要求，我们希望在５月３日中午１２∶００以前予以答复，并在对具体要求作具体答复的基础上，附注各条答复的理由，形成书面文件。
    二、如果５月３日中午１２∶００以前我们得不到答复，我们将保留在５月４日继续游行请愿的权利。
    三、关于第一轮对话我们建议在５月４日上午８∶３０，地点可设在北京大学。
    四、此请愿书将抄送一副本给中华人民共和国政治协商会议。
