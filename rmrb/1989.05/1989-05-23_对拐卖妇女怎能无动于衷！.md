I grew up in Hong Kong and studied in the United States. Three years ago, I returned to mainland China to settle down. Since then, I have had many observations. In terms of material civilization, our country certainly lags behind Western European nations. However, what concerns me the most is the issue of spiritual civilization. Below, I recount an incident that many people might know about, but which is allowed to persist in our society!

A few months ago, I visited Wán County in Hebei Province. This is a poverty-stricken mountainous area. On my first day there, I heard villagers discussing the trafficking of women. Human traffickers bring young women, aged 18 or 19, from the south. For 3,000 yuan, anyone can take one home, regardless of the methods used to bring her there or whether the girl consents. Once the buyer pays the money, he must marry the girl, even if it means using force. The entire family works together to make this marriage happen. As long as the family acknowledges the marriage, obtaining a marriage certificate is irrelevant. Then, family members will constantly watch over this new bride, fearing she might run away. In reality, escaping is not easy because most villagers do not sympathize with the trafficked girls. In this area, raising 3,000 yuan is very difficult, so no one wants to let her escape. Therefore, everyone helps to keep an eye on her. Villagers told me that one girl escaped three times, and was eventually beaten and had her legs broken by her "husband." Another girl was caught after trying to escape and was tied up in the house by her "family" all day.

In Yangjiatai Township, I personally saw two women who had been bought as brides. I asked one of them how she ended up there, and her eyes welled up with tears, but she did not answer. Her mother-in-law stayed by her side the entire time, fearing she might say something to me.

The activities of human traffickers are not limited to Wán County; they also occur in Yì County, Táng County, and other nearby mountainous areas.

I once asked a village committee secretary and two brigade leaders why they did not intervene when girls were beaten for trying to escape. They replied, "We can't do anything about it." Once someone pays 3,000 yuan, the girl is theirs. If you interfere, they will resent you. One of them said that he knew of three human traffickers in the village, but he dared not expose them, fearing retaliation. He mentioned that the public security bureau recently arrested some human traffickers, but only fined them, allowing them to continue their activities.

Someone advised me, "You are here to work. If you make a big fuss about buying brides, the locals will hold a grudge against you, and your work will be difficult." I carefully considered his words and found some truth in them. If this matter can attract the attention of relevant departments and be properly handled, those whose interests are harmed may retaliate against me, making it impossible for me to continue working here. However, this phenomenon, which violates the Marriage Law and tramples on women's rights, must be stopped. Perhaps I cannot change this reality, but I must do my part.

### 对拐卖妇女怎能无动于衷！

专栏：心里话

　　对拐卖妇女怎能无动于衷！
    我在香港长大，又到美国留学，三年前回大陆定居。回来后我的感想很多。要说物质文明，我国当然与西欧国家有非常大的差距，说句心里话，最叫我担心的，还是精神文明方面的问题。下面我叙述的事，大概很多人都知道，但却任它在我们的社会里存在下去！
    几个月前，我来到河北完县。这里是贫困山区。我到的第一天，就听村人谈论贩卖妇女的事。人贩子从南方领来的十八九岁姑娘，交３０００元钱就可领走人，不管是用什么手段把人弄来的，也不管姑娘是否愿意。买主既付了钱，就要与买来的姑娘成亲，甚至不惜用强迫的方法。买媳妇是全家人合力干的，只要家庭承认这种婚姻，领不领结婚证无所谓。然后，家人会整天看守着这位媳妇，生怕她逃跑。事实上，要逃并不容易，因为一般村人不同情买来的少女。在这里，筹３０００元是很不容易的，怎能让她跑掉！所以大家一起帮助监视。听村人说，有一个少女逃跑了３次，最后被她的“男人”打断了腿；另一个少女逃跑被抓回来后，“家人”整天用绳把她捆在屋里。
    在杨家台乡，我亲眼见过两个买来的媳妇。我曾问其中一个怎么会到了这里，她眼圈一红，没有答话。她婆婆寸步不离地守着她，生怕她跟我谈了些什么。
    人贩子的活动不单完县有，易县、唐县和附近一带山区也都存在。
    我曾问一位村支部书记和两位大队长，对殴打逃跑少女的事为什么不管一管？他们答复“管不了”。人家既然付了３０００块钱，媳妇就是他的了。你管，他会恨你。其中一位说，他明知村里有３个人贩子，但他不敢声张，否则会遭报复。他说，最近公安局拘捕人贩子，也只是罚款了事，人贩子照样干他的。
    有人劝我说，你是来这里工作的，若把买媳妇的事闹大了，当地人怀恨在心，以后工作就不好做了。我细细思量他的话，觉得有些道理。这件事若能引起有关部门注意并认真处理，则利益受损的人可能会报复我，那么我在这里就不能继续工作下去了。但是，这种违反婚姻法、践踏妇女权益行为的现象必须予以制止。也许我改变不了这一事实，可我必须尽自己的一份力量。
