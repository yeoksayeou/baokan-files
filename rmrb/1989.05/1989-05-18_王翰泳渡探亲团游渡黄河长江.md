Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 16th - The first Chinese person to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar met the first Chinese person to climb Mount Everest today. Their hands were tightly clasped together.

Yesterday, 35-year-old Wang Han led a delegation of 19 people from the Wang Han Swimming Reunion Team from Taipei to Beijing via Hong Kong. Wang Fu Zhou, the veteran mountaineer who first climbed Mount Everest and the general manager of the China International Sports Travel Company, hosted a dinner for Wang Han and the swimming team members this evening. Wang Han, the first person to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar, told reporters at the airport that swimming across the Strait of Gibraltar was part of the "Swimming for the Spirit of the Chinese People" series of activities. This record belongs to all Chinese people. Wang Han expressed that climbing Mount Everest is a remarkable achievement and a source of pride for all Chinese people.

Wang Han initiated the "Swimming for the Spirit of the Chinese People" activity in 1986 and successfully swam across the Strait of Gibraltar and the English Channel in 1986 and 1987, respectively.

The Wang Han Swimming Reunion Team is visiting the mainland to swim across the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. They will swim across the Yellow River on May 17th and the Yangtze River on May 21st.
