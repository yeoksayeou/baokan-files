Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 25th.

In recent days, the Beijing Military Region Party Committee and the Second Artillery Party Committee Standing Committee have studied the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun on May 19th. They have resolved to closely unite around the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, to follow orders and directives, and to implement the correct decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council with practical actions. They aim to contribute to the stabilization of the capital and the nation.

The Beijing Military Region Party Committee, during their study and discussion, believed that the current struggle is a serious political struggle concerning the success or failure of reform and construction, and the fate of the country and the nation. In this severe situation, it is our duty to resolutely stop and quell the turmoil and maintain social stability.

The troops under the Beijing Military Region, especially those executing the martial law, have, through study and discussion, further clarified the nature and harm of this turmoil, and understood their heavy responsibilities. The broad masses of soldiers have shown high political awareness, strong organizational discipline, and good military skills in the face of new tasks and tests. Currently, all units are conducting extensive and in-depth ideological education as required by the Military Region Party Committee. They are vigorously carrying forward the glorious tradition of the military loving the government and the people, using various forms to conduct mass work. They are organizing the troops to listen to the central voice in a timely manner, not listening to or believing various political rumors, and actively conducting propaganda work towards society, explaining the necessity of implementing martial law. The broad masses of soldiers are determined to carry forward the good style of unity between the military and the people, to unite closely, follow orders, and obey commands, striving to complete the tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission.

The Second Artillery Party Committee Standing Committee, during their study and discussion, expressed firm support for the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, and firmly supported the State Council's decisive measures to implement martial law. The committee also issued a notice requiring all subordinate units to educate the broad masses of soldiers to grasp policies, strictly observe discipline, consciously protect the masses, and do more propaganda and explanatory work, avoiding actions that harm military-civilian relations.

In recent days, the Party Committee of the Academy of Military Sciences and the National Defense University have studied the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They expressed firm support for the major decisions made by the Central Committee to stop the turmoil.

The Party Committee of the Academy of Military Sciences, during their study and discussion, believed that the purpose of this turmoil is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and oppose the socialist system. Everyone with patriotic conscience must take immediate action to resolutely stop the turmoil. They believed that defending the peaceful labor of the people is a sacred mission entrusted by the constitution to the military. The military's execution of martial law is in line with the fundamental functions of the military and the fundamental interests of the people, and will definitely be understood and supported by the broad masses of the people. The committee also required all members of the academy to clearly align with the Central Committee, follow orders, obey commands, guard their posts, and fulfill their duties, making active contributions to stabilizing the situation with practical actions.

The Party Committee of the National Defense University, during their study, unanimously expressed that in this struggle against turmoil, they must resolutely implement the correct policies of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. They said that in the current severe situation, the State Council's decision to impose martial law on parts of Beijing is a wise decision to quickly stop the turmoil, stabilize the capital and the nation, protect the achievements of ten years of reform, and defend the four cardinal principles. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary soldier must clearly stand up for maintaining a stable and united political situation and make their due contributions.

In recent days, the Party Committees and governments of Shandong, Beijing, Sichuan, and Jilin have sent telegrams to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressing firm support for the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. They also expressed firm support for the decisions and measures of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to restore order in the capital.

Shandong Province: On the morning of May 20th, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government held a meeting to study and discuss the important speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. The meeting unanimously agreed that the decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil and restore normal order are timely, decisive, and correct, reflecting the will of the Party, the military, and the people. They completely support and will resolutely implement these decisions. They will follow the policies and guidelines set by the Central Committee, actively and cautiously do a good job in stabilizing the overall situation.

The meeting, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the actual situation in Shandong, decided that the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government would immediately issue a notice requiring all localities to organize cadres and the masses to study Li Peng's important speech, unify thoughts and actions. On the afternoon of the 21st, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting of provincial Party, government, and military leaders, with the main leaders of various provincial-level leading bodies, municipal and county Party committees, provincial departments, and higher education institutions attending. The meeting conveyed the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, reported relevant situations, and made specific arrangements for stopping the turmoil and restoring and maintaining normal order. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government required:

1. All levels of Party committees, governments, and various industries should organize Party members, cadres, and the masses to study Li Peng's speech, link it to reality, further unify thoughts, and recognize that the few people who deliberately created turmoil wanted to achieve their political goals of denying the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system under the conditions of turmoil. They cannot achieve this through normal democratic and legal channels. They must recognize the great significance of stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation, unify thoughts with the instructions of the Central Committee and the spirit of Li Peng's speech, and take decisive measures to stop the turmoil and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and various construction projects.

2. To maintain a stable and united political situation, concentrate forces, strengthen measures, and maintain and restore social normal order. All state organ workers and employees of factories, mines, enterprises, and institutions should be loyal to their duties and guard their posts; all levels of judicial and administrative organs and departments such as railways and transportation should further maintain social order and traffic order; schools that have not resumed classes should immediately and unconditionally resume classes and restore normal teaching order. With a high sense of political responsibility, everyone should contribute to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation at their respective posts.

3. To strictly follow the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, distinguish between the patriotic enthusiasm of students and the few people who created turmoil. They must resolutely oppose the turmoil while paying attention to protecting the patriotic enthusiasm of students who hope to promote democratic political construction. They must focus on educating and guiding students, and not pursue their overzealous words and deeds during the student movement.

4. To strengthen publicity and ideological and political work. Newspapers, radio, television, and other news media should concentrate on propagating the major decisions of the Central Committee to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation, as well as the positive responses of all sectors of society, playing their due guiding role. All levels of Party committees and governments and mass organizations such as trade unions, women's federations, and youth leagues should do a good job in ideological and political work, unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors, and maintain the overall stability and unity. All levels of Party organizations, all Communist Party members, Young Pioneers, and state cadres should play the role of fortresses and vanguards in uniting the masses and stopping the turmoil. Party and youth league organizations and student unions in colleges and universities should actively and positively do in-depth and solid ideological and political work, reaching out to young students. Further unify thoughts and seek consensus.

5. To strengthen Party building and clean government construction. For the arrangements already made by the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, all localities and departments should implement them seriously and quickly achieve results. They should increase the openness of Party and government work, continue to carry out multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form consultations and dialogues with all sectors of society, including students, listen to their criticisms, opinions, and suggestions, and improve our work, further promoting democratic political construction.

6. To guide the attention and enthusiasm of the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the masses to the treatment and rectification, deepening of reform, and current work. They should coordinate and arrange comprehensively, strive to do a good job in agricultural and industrial production and other aspects, and ensure the completion of all tasks set in the national economic and social development plan for this year.

7. All levels of Party committees and governments should strengthen the leadership of the current struggle, be firm in their stance, clearly display their banners, and consciously maintain political unity with the Central Committee. In their work, they should be proactive and daring, manage and control, start from reality, be cautious and detailed, pay attention to legal procedures, and properly handle various problems.

Beijing Municipality: On May 19th, all members of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, as well as the main leaders of districts, counties, and colleges and universities, directly listened to the important speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference, and were greatly inspired. They completely agree with and unanimously support the correct decisions and work arrangements of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and are determined to implement them. In this serious political struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the future of the country, they will face the test and fulfill their duties.

In recent days, according to the spirit of the Central Committee, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have required all Party members, Young Pioneers, leading cadres at all levels, and all state employees in the city to take immediate action, vigorously propagate to the masses, mobilize the masses, organize the masses, and rely on the masses to maintain order and stabilize the situation. All levels of Party organizations have done ideological work for the masses in a layered and targeted manner, affirming the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students while pointing out the serious consequences of the turmoil, gradually stabilizing people's minds. They have clearly put forward the slogan "Organize, restore order, ensure production, and guarantee life," mobilizing the masses to remove roadblocks, restore traffic, combat criminals, maintain public order, and improve the production and living order disrupted by the turmoil.

Since the implementation of martial law, all officers and soldiers of the martial law troops have given us great support. The broad masses of officers and soldiers, facing a complex situation, have shown the high political awareness, strong organizational discipline, and good military skills of the people's army, setting an example for us. We must closely cooperate with all officers and soldiers of the martial law troops, work together, support each other, and with indomitable will, strive to complete the task of restoring normal order in the capital as soon as possible.

In recent days, we have also seen telegrams from all provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, major military regions, and military branches to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, unanimously expressing firm support for the correct decisions of the Central Committee and the decisive measures taken by the Central Committee to quickly restore normal order in the capital, making our confidence more solid and our spirits more vibrant. We must, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, unite all forces that can be united, including the broad masses of young students, clearly oppose the turmoil, stop the turmoil, adhere to the four cardinal principles, maintain the overall stability and unity, and continue to promote the cause of reform and opening up and socialist modernization.

Sichuan Province: On the morning of May 20th, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting to study and discuss the important speech of Li Peng and proposed implementation measures. In the afternoon, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting attended by the leaders of several provincial-level organizations, the Provincial Party Committee departments, the local organizations of the Democratic Parties, Chengdu City, and the responsible persons of colleges and universities in the Chengdu area. Yang Rudi represented the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and spoke, firmly supporting the speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference.

The Provincial Party Committee decided:

1. All units should immediately organize cadres and workers to study Li Peng's important speech, recognize the serious political struggle of a few people deliberately creating turmoil through the student movement. In the study, they should fully present facts and reason, unifying the understanding of the broad masses of workers with the spirit of the Central Committee.

2. Take decisive but cautious measures to quell the situation and restore normal production, work, and living order. All schools should do a good job, mobilizing students who are still marching and sitting to immediately return to school and study, and announce that they are not allowed to march on the streets or go to other places to link up. Public security police and armed police should strengthen social security management, maintain social order, and prevent criminals from engaging in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and various illegal activities. In executing tasks, they should strictly observe discipline, remain calm and restrained, and avoid new problems.

3. The broad masses of cadres and workers should guard their production and work posts, do a good job in the current rectification and deepening of reform, disaster relief, rural "double cropping," and industrial production. The broad masses of cadres and workers should persuade their relatives and children to return to school.

4. Pay attention to the reasonable opinions raised by young students and the masses, actively and broadly carry out multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form dialogues, and improve our work, especially to take further measures to strengthen clean government construction, eliminate corruption, overcome bureaucratism, and strive to solve existing problems on the track of democracy and the rule of law, improving the trust of the broad masses in the Party and the government.

Yang Rudi called on all levels of Party organizations to play a core leadership role in stabilizing the situation, requiring Communist Party members to take the lead in maintaining the overall stability and unity, and hoping that members of the Democratic Parties and people from all walks of life would actively assist the Party and the government in doing this work.

On the morning of the 21st, Yang Rudi, at the study meeting of the Provincial Propaganda Department, required everyone to seriously study and implement the spirit of Li Peng's important speech, do a good job, and stabilize the situation. He hoped that the propaganda, news units, and people from all walks of life would do more guiding and persuading work for young students, persuading them to return to school and study, and quickly quell the situation.

Jilin Province: On May 20th, the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee held an expanded meeting to seriously study and discuss the important speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference. The attendees unanimously supported the important speeches of Li Peng and Yang Shangkun and called on the people of the entire province to seriously study and implement the spirit of the two speeches, urgently mobilize, and take decisive and powerful measures to clearly oppose the turmoil, restore social normal order, maintain stability and unity, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction. The following is a report on the further implementation of the spirit of the Central Committee:

They required every Communist Party member and state cadre to maintain political unity with the Party Central Committee and play a model role, not only not doing things that are not conducive to the stabilization of the overall situation but also actively doing a good job in the work of the masses.

4. In terms of organizational leadership, there are two sets of working teams, one responsible for handling the current situation and the other responsible for organizing production and handling daily work.

The committee believed that in recent days, a few people participated in marches, demonstrations, and support activities in the name of "Central Party School teachers and students." These people do not represent the Central Party School, and some are not even people from the Central Party School. The broad masses of teachers and students at the Central Party School are firmly opposed to their actions. Everyone expressed that they would resolutely implement the various decisions of the Central Committee, strive for the four cardinal principles, maintain the overall stability and unity, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up.

    新华社北京５月２５日电  中共中央党校校务委员会５月２３日写信给党中央，表示坚决拥护党中央、国务院作出的制止动乱的正确决策，并指出近日来以“中共中央党校师生”的名义参加游行、示威等活动的少数人“不能代表中央党校”，信的全文如下：党中央：
    中央党校校委认真学习讨论了李鹏、杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上的重要讲话，一致同意中央对当前形势的正确分析，坚决拥护党中央、国务院作出的制止动乱的正确决策。校委结合党校实际情况，要求全体学员和工作人员在政治上与中央保持高度一致，坚决执行国务院和北京市政府有关实行戒严的命令，自觉维护正常的工作秩序、学习秩序和社会秩序，旗帜鲜明地参加这场关系到党和国家前途命运的政治斗争。校委讨论认为，近日有少数人以“中共中央党校师生”的名义参加游行、示威和声援等活动，这些人不能代表中央党校，有些也不是中央党校的人，中央党校的广大师生是坚决反对他们的这种行为的。大家表示，要坚决贯彻落实中央的各项决定，为坚持四项基本原则，维护安定团结的大局，保证改革开放的顺利进行而努力奋斗。
  　　　　　中共中央党校校务委员会　１９８９年５月２３日。
