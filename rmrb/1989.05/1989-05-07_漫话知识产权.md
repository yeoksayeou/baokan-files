The rapid technological revolution that is sweeping the world is constantly impacting and transforming society's production methods and industrial structures. As a result, legal issues related to intellectual property have become a hot topic.

Knowledge and technology, as a unique product, are the fruits of human intellectual labor. The application of these products can yield enormous economic and social benefits. To ensure that society benefits from these products, and to compensate the laborers both spiritually and materially, while also inspiring continuous creativity, it is objectively necessary for the state to recognize the creators as the owners of intellectual achievements. Legally, it is essential to protect their right to control their creations, meaning that others cannot use their achievements without permission. Since intellectual achievements are intangible and have unique operational laws, traditional laws are incapable of fulfilling this task. Hence, the intellectual property rights system was born.

Intellectual property rights are a collective term for civil rights, primarily consisting of copyrights (also known as literary property rights) and industrial property rights. Copyrights refer to the rights that authors of literary, artistic, and scientific works enjoy by law. Industrial property rights mainly include patent rights and trademark rights. As a legally defined right, intellectual property has a history of over three hundred years.

According to the definitions and related conventions of the World Intellectual Property Organization, intellectual property rights, in addition to copyrights, patent rights, and trademark rights, also include service marks, trade names, origin marks (also known as place of origin names), and the right to prevent unfair competition. In recent years, due to the impact of the technological and information revolutions, computer software has also been included in the intellectual property rights category. It can be foreseen that with the development of science and culture, as well as the advancement of dissemination technologies, the members of the intellectual property rights family will continue to increase and multiply.

Since its inception, the intellectual property rights system has played a significant role in promoting human civilization. In developed countries, intellectual property has become a major component of large enterprises' assets and a decisive factor in these countries' economic development. The U.S. government claims that the U.S. is transitioning from an industrial economy to an information economy. This change is reflected in U.S. foreign trade, where the proportion of information and technology in trade composition is increasingly higher, rather than material products. Some developed countries believe that developed countries are no longer the world's factories; instead, they will primarily develop and export advanced science and technology and knowledge. The 21st century will be the century of intellectual property rights. This situation has led developed countries to increasingly emphasize the protection of intellectual property rights, with the U.S., as the world's largest producer and exporter of intellectual property rights, being particularly prominent. The U.S. government often personally intervenes to protect the intellectual property rights of its major companies. For example, in the dispute between IBM of the U.S. and Fujitsu of Japan over basic software publication rights, Fujitsu was forced to pay IBM $400 million in settlement fees.

However, in the current situation where there is a significant gap in technological levels between the South and the North, transnational corporations from developed countries gain high global profits through the new technological revolution. This has led to sharp contradictions between developing countries and developed countries in the field of intellectual property rights. Economists from the Third World refer to this situation as neo-colonialism. Developing countries are striving to change this status quo, while developed countries use various means to maintain and consolidate this situation.

Recently, the U.S. government has been actively promoting a global campaign, demanding that governments of various countries protect computer programs with copyright laws in accordance with U.S. methods. Those who do not comply will face retaliation in trade and technology transfers. With developed countries at the center, they are hastily formulating international rules and using international organizations and rules to promote U.S. proposals. For instance, at the recent "Model Provisions for National Copyright Laws" discussion held in Geneva by the World Intellectual Property Organization, developed countries followed the U.S. lead, demanding that computer programs be listed as formal clauses for protection subjects. Developing countries strongly opposed this. It can be foreseen that the struggle between the South and North blocs in the field of intellectual property rights will intensify.

　　漫话知识产权
    刘春田
    日新月异，风靡世界的新技术革命，不断地冲击和改变着社会的生产方式和产业结构。由此而产生的法律问题——知识产权，正在成为当前的一个热门话题。
    知识和技术作为一种特殊产品，是人们智力劳动的结晶，而对这些产品的应用又可以产生巨大的经济和社会效益。为了让社会得益于这些产品，同时使劳动者的支出获得精神和物质的补偿，并激发人们持续创造的热情，客观上要求国家承认创造者是智力成果的所有者，法律上应当维护他们对其成果享有支配权，即不经他们许可，他人不得应用他们的成果。由于智力成果是无形的，有其特殊的活动规律，传统法律已无力完成这个任务，于是就产生了知识产权制度。
    知识产权是以著作权（又称版权）和工业产权为主要内容的民事权利的统称。著作权是指文学、艺术和科学作品的作者依法所享有的权利。工业产权主要包括专利权和商标权。知识产权作为法定权利，已有了三百多年的历史。
    根据世界知识产权组织对知识产权的定义和有关公约的规定，知识产权除了著作权、专利权和商标权外，还包括服务标记、厂商名称、货源标记（又称产地名称）、原产地名称以及制止不正当竞争等方面的权利。近几年，受科技革命、信息革命浪潮的冲击，计算机软件等又相继加入了知识产权的行列。可以预见，随着科学文化的发展以及传播技术的进步，知识产权家族的成员，还会不断地增加、繁衍。
    知识产权制度产生以来，对促进人类文明起了巨大的作用。在发达国家，知识产权成为大企业的主要财产构成，并成为这些国家经济发展的决定性因素。美国政府声称，美国正从工业经济转向信息经济。美国的对外贸易反映了这一变化，在贸易构成中日益增加的不是物质产品，而是信息和技术。有的发达国家则认为，发达国家不再是世界的加工厂，他们将来主要是开发和输出先进的科学技术和知识，２１世纪将是知识产权世纪。这种情况导致发达国家越来越重视对知识产权的保护，而作为世界上知识产权最大生产国和输出国的美国更为突出。美国政府经常亲自出面保护本国大公司的知识产权。例如，在美国ＩＢＭ公司与日本富士通公司关于基本软件出版权的纠纷中，富士通公司被迫向ＩＢＭ公司支付了４亿美元的和解费。
    但是，在当前南北科技水平尚存在很大差距的情况下，发达国家的跨国公司则通过新技术革命获得高额的全球利润，这就使发展中国家在知识产权问题上同发达国家存在着尖锐的矛盾。第三世界的经济学家称这种情况为新殖民主义。发展中国家力图改变这种现状，发达国家则利用各种手段维护和巩固这种局面。
    最近，美国政府四处活动，开展了全球性的攻势，要求各国政府按照美国的办法对计算机程序给予著作权法律保护。谁不照办就要在贸易和科技转让方面给予报复，并以发达国家为中心，抓紧制订国际规则，利用国际组织和国际规则推行美国的主张。譬如，前不久，世界知识产权组织在日内瓦召开的“著作权立法示范条款”讨论会上，发达国家纷纷步美国后尘，要求把计算机程序作为正式条款列为保护客体。发展中国家则强烈反对。可以预见，在知识产权领域，南北集团之间的斗争会日趋加强。
