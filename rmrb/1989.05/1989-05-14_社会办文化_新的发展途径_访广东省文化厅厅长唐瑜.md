The reporter: Recently, while reporting in Guangdong, I was deeply impressed by the socially run culture in your province. Could you please introduce the situation?

Tang Yu: The involvement of various sectors of society in running culture began in Guangdong in the early 1980s. At that time, various entertainment projects and cultural services operated by various units and individuals emerged one after another, forming a market-oriented cultural market throughout the province. Later, the scope of social participation in running culture gradually expanded, and the purpose was not limited to direct economic benefits. Frequently seen were enterprises jointly organizing or investing in art performances and art competitions, such as the "Sixth National Games," "Guangdong Joy Festival," and "Guangzhou International Dance Competition," which were all held with the strong support of enterprises. Later, over the past two to three years, some enterprises, streets, and townships, out of the need to improve the cultural quality of their units, have been striving to improve the local cultural environment and carry out mass cultural and sports activities. At the same time, many public cultural units (mainly art troupes) have adopted various methods to cooperate with enterprises, and some have already operated under the enterprise's banner; some have been taken over by contractors for independent operation and are no longer directly managed by the cultural departments. According to Guangdong Province's statistics for 1988, there were 12,900 cultural units formed by various sectors of society, not including a large number of cultural specialists in rural areas. In summary, socially run culture in Guangdong has become an increasingly popular trend.

The reporter: What new changes has socially run culture brought to the cultural industry?

Tang Yu: The changes are varied. First, it has changed the old system of the state's comprehensive management, and a new pattern of the state and society jointly running culture has emerged. The following figures are convincing: According to statistics from Foshan City, in recent years, the government has invested 17 million yuan in cultural construction, while various sectors of society have invested 13 million yuan. In the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, from the establishment of the zone to 1987, the government invested 98 million yuan in cultural construction, while social investment reached 400 million yuan. Another special economic zone, Zhuhai City, had invested 13.35 million yuan by the government and over 100 million yuan by society by 1987.

Secondly, socially run culture, through various channels of organizing performances, has promoted the prosperity and development of the arts, enabling the people to enjoy more abundant and diverse cultural entertainment. Taking the statistics of 15 major theaters (stadiums) in Guangzhou as an example: In 1987, a total of 59 state-owned art troupes performed 894 shows in these theaters; 46 troupes temporarily organized by society performed 108 shows. The situation in 1988 showed a significant change: 49 state-owned art troupes performed 267 shows in these theaters; 63 socially run troupes performed 268 shows; 81 temporarily organized troupes by society performed 222 shows; the number of performances by state-owned, socially run, and temporarily organized troupes was about one-third each, forming a tripod.

The reporter: What are the historical reasons for the formation of the socially run culture situation?

Tang Yu: Socially run culture emerged with the reform of China's economic system. Our country is transitioning from a product economy to a commodity economy, changing the practice of the state directly operating and managing various economic enterprises. The practice of the state directly managing various cultural undertakings formed under the product economy model must also change. Practice has long proven that the state's direct operation of culture does not necessarily yield the best results, and socially run culture is also a necessary result of the inherent movement of the cultural mechanism.

Secondly, it is in line with the diverse cultural needs of the masses. Under the commodity economy, people's lifestyles, aesthetic tastes, and ideological concepts are constantly changing. The desire for knowledge, entertainment, and beauty has never been as strong as it is now. The awareness of exploration, information, and universal communication are all reflected in cultural life. It is under these circumstances that the pattern of socially run culture has emerged.

The reporter: What are the main problems with socially run culture at present?

Tang Yu: There are mainly three problems. First is the problem of changing the mindset of cultural management departments. Some of our comrades are still used to thinking about how many stalls the state should set up and how large a team it should maintain to develop cultural undertakings, and they are very unadapted to the new situation of socially run culture. Second is the problem of handling the relationship between state-run culture and socially run culture. Socially run culture has played a good supplementary and complementary role to state-run culture, but it will inevitably create conflicts. The most prominent manifestation is the trend of "performing on the side" by artists in art troupes. Third is the problem of how to handle the relationship between the social benefits and economic benefits of cultural products. The inherent negative effects of the commodity economy will inevitably be reflected in the cultural field, and it will exist for a long time, so long-term work is required. For the negative factors generated by socially run culture, we must improve various management regulations and guide and manage them through public opinion, administration, law, and economy. We must also rely on state-run culture to play a leading and exemplary role, establish a new cultural mechanism that organically combines administrative mechanisms with market mechanisms, and make socially run culture increasingly healthy and the path increasingly broad.

　　社会办文化——新的发展途径   
    ——访广东省文化厅厅长唐瑜
    本报记者  易凯
    记者：最近在广东采访，对贵省社会办文化留下了深刻的印象，请介绍一下这方面的情况。
    唐瑜：社会各方参与办文化，在广东始于８０年代初期，当时相继出现的由各单位、个人经营的种种娱乐项目和文化服务，在全省形成了一个经营性质的文化市场。其后，社会参与办文化的范围逐渐扩大，其目的也不限于直接的经济效益，经常出现的是企业联合主办或投资赞助文艺演出、艺术比赛，例如“六届全运会”、“广东欢乐节”、“羊城国际舞蹈比赛”等颇具声势的文体活动，都是在企业的鼎力赞助下举办的。再后，是近两三年，一些企业、街道、乡镇出于提高本单位文化素质的需要，纷纷致力改善当地的文化环境，开展群众文体活动。与此同时，不少全民制的文化单位（主要是艺术团体）采取了多种方式与企业联合，有的已以企业牌子开展活动；还有一些改为由承包者自主经营，不再由文化部门直接管理。据广东省１９８８年统计，社会各方组成的文化单位为１２９００个，还未包括农村中大量的文化专业户。总之，社会各方办文化在广东已成为一种越来越热的趋势。
    记者：社会办文化为文化事业带来了哪些新变化？
    唐瑜：变化有多种多样。首先，它改变了国家统包统管的旧体制，出现了国家、社会一起办文化的新格局。下面几个数字是有说服力的：据佛山市的统计，这几年由政府投放于文化建设的资金为１７００万元，由社会各方的投资为１３００万元。深圳特区，从建立特区到１９８７年，政府投放文化建设的资金为９８００万元，而社会投资高达４亿元。另一特区珠海市，至１９８７年，政府投资为１３３５万元，社会投资为１亿多元。
    其次，社会办文化，通过各种渠道组织演出，促进了文艺的繁荣和发展，使人民群众能获得更丰富更多样的文化娱乐。以广州市１５个主要剧场（体育馆）的统计数字为例：１９８７年，进入这些剧场演出的国营艺术团体共５９个，演出８９４场；由社会临时组合的演出团共４６个，演出１０８场。１９８８年情况就有较大变化，进入这些剧场演出的国营艺术团体为４９个，演出２６７场；社会办团体为６３个，演出２６８场；社会临时组合的团为８１个，演出２２２场；国营、社会办团体、社会临时组合演出场次各为１／３，鼎足三分。
    记者：社会办文化局面形成的历史原因是什么？
    唐瑜：社会办文化是伴随着我国经济体制的改革而出现的。我们国家从产品经济转向商品经济，改变了由国家直接经营和管理各种经济企业的做法，在产品经济模式下形成的国家直接管理各种文化事业的做法势必也要变化。实践早已证明，国家直接经营文化效益不一定全佳，社会办文化也是文化机制自身运动必然结果。
    其次，它是与群众对文化生活的多种需求相适应的。在商品经济情况下，人民的生活方式、审美情趣和思想观念都在不断产生变化，求知、求乐、求美的愿望从未像现在这样强烈，开拓意识、信息观念、普遍交往的要求，都反映到文化生活上来，正是在这种情况下，社会办文化的格局才应运而生。
    记者：当前社会办文化存在哪些问题？
    唐瑜：主要有３个问题。一是文化主管部门观念转变问题。我们一些同志仍习惯于设想国家铺多少摊子、养多大的队伍来发展文化事业，对社会办文化新形势很不适应。二是处理国办文化与社会办文化的关系问题。社会办文化对国办文化起了很好的补充、配合作用，也必然产生矛盾。突出的表现就是艺术团体演员“走穴”之风。三是如何处理文化产品的社会效益与经济效益的关系问题。商品经济固有的消极作用必然反映到文化方面来，它将会长期存在，因而必须进行长期的工作。对社会办文化产生的某些消极因素，要靠完善各种管理法规，通过舆论、行政、法律和经济的手段来加以引导和管理，还要通过国办文化起主导和示范的作用，建立行政机制与市场机制有机结合的文化新机制，使社会办文化越来越健康，路子越走越宽。
