	Baker Departing for Visit to the Soviet Union
	To Discuss Arms Control Talks and Other Issues

	Washington, May 8 (Xinhua) — U.S. Secretary of State Baker left Washington by plane today for Moscow. He will hold the first formal meeting between the U.S. and Soviet foreign ministers since the Bush administration took office, with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, from May 10 to 11.

	The meeting between the U.S. and Soviet foreign ministers was agreed upon in early March this year when Baker and Shevardnadze attended the opening ceremony of the European conventional forces reduction talks in Vienna. According to the agreed schedule, the two foreign ministers will discuss arms control, regional conflicts, bilateral relations, and human rights issues, as well as international issues such as environmental protection, drugs, and terrorism. Soviet leader Gorbachev will meet with Baker and his delegation on May 11.

	During the talks, Baker will emphasize regional conflict issues, such as Central America and the Middle East. He will also raise the issue of preventing the proliferation of missiles and chemical weapons.

	Washington, May 9 (Xinhua) — U.S. Secretary of State Baker told reporters traveling with him en route to Helsinki that he is taking a series of proposals to Moscow to test whether the Kremlin truly has a "new way of thinking."

	It is also reported that Baker will not engage in substantive discussions on arms control issues during his meetings with Soviet leader Gorbachev and Shevardnadze, as the Bush administration has not yet completed its review of defense and arms control issues. However, during the meeting between the two foreign ministers, a date for the resumption of strategic arms reduction talks may be set. Additionally, Baker will assure the Soviet leadership that the new Bush administration will not completely overturn the agreements reached by the Reagan administration with the Soviet Union on strategic arms talks. However, Baker will not agree to the Soviet proposal for a summit meeting between Bush and Gorbachev in the near future, as the United States believes that a summit meeting should be held only after substantial progress has been made in U.S.-Soviet relations. Baker also does not plan to discuss the issue of reducing short-range missiles in Europe with the Soviet Union.

　　贝克启程出访苏联
    将讨论军控谈判等问题
    本报华盛顿５月８日电  记者张启昕报道：美国国务卿贝克今天乘飞机离开华盛顿前往莫斯科，并将于本月１０日至１１日同苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽举行布什政府执政以来的第一次美苏外长正式会谈。
    美苏外长的这次会谈是贝克和谢瓦尔德纳泽今年３月初在维也纳参加欧洲裁减常规力量谈判的开幕式时商定的。根据双方商定的日程，两国外长除讨论军备控制、地区冲突、双边关系和人权问题外，还将讨论环境保护、毒品、恐怖主义等国际性问题。苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫将于１１日会见贝克一行。
    在会谈中，贝克将强调地区冲突问题，如中美洲、中东问题。他还将提出防止导弹和化学武器的扩散问题。
    本报华盛顿５月９日电　记者张亮报道：美国国务卿贝克在前往赫尔辛基途中对随团记者说，他向莫斯科带来了一系列建议，检验克里姆林宫是否真正有“新思维”。
    另据透露，贝克与苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫以及谢瓦尔德纳泽会晤时不会就军备控制问题进行实质性的讨论，因为布什政府尚未完成其防务和军备控制问题的审查，但是，两国外长会晤期间可能会确定恢复削减战略武器谈判的日期。此外，贝克将向苏联领导人保证，布什新政府不会完全推翻里根政府与苏联在战略武器谈判问题上已经达成的一致意见。但是，贝克不会同意苏联提出的布什与戈尔巴乔夫近期举行首脑会晤的建议，因为美国主张首脑会晤要到美苏关系取得实质性进展时才能举行。贝克也不计划与苏联讨论削减欧洲短导问题。
