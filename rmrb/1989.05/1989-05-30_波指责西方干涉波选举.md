    Poland Accuses Western Interference in Polish Elections

    Xinhua News Agency Warsaw, May 29th - The Polish government's news bureau authorized the release of a statement on the 29th, accusing certain Western groups and individuals of donating funds to support the opposition led by Solidarity in their election activities.

    The statement said that diplomatic personnel from some countries not only expressed political sympathy for Poland's opposition but also actively participated in various meetings and activities organized by the opposition, and frequently provided "guidance."

    The statement also pointed out that the United States and some other Western countries openly raised large sums of money to support the election activities of Poland's opposition. They also sent printing equipment and propaganda posters.

    The statement said that the Polish government believes that the actions of certain individuals and institutions in the West to interfere in Poland's elections are "an unprecedented interference in Poland's sovereignty." The Polish government urges them to immediately stop any form of interference.
