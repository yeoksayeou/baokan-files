Soviet newspapers today published an investigation report by the special committee of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR regarding the violation of discipline by investigators Godlyan and Ivanov during the investigation of cases.

The report makes two recommendations: to entrust the Procurator of the USSR to thoroughly investigate all accusations against Godlyan and Ivanov for violating discipline during the investigation of cases, and to thoroughly investigate the materials of denunciations involving criminal groups of responsible workers in central and local party and state bodies, and to report the results.

Godlyan and Ivanov began investigating the case of bribery by leaders of the Uzbek SSR in September 1983. The investigative group worked in Uzbekistan for over five years, holding 70 people criminally liable, submitting 19 cases to the court, and 40 people were tried. Because this case involved Brezhnev's son-in-law Churbanov and the former First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Republic, Rashidov, it became a sensation throughout the Soviet Union.

The investigation report states that the Central Committee of the Party and the Soviet bodies received complaints from citizens about the investigative group, exposing that Godlyan and other investigators artificially expanded the scope of officials accused of embezzlement, and used coercion to obtain confessions during the investigation. Godlyan and others also attempted to influence the Supreme Court regarding the Churbanov case and criticized the court's sentence as being too lenient.

On May 12, 1989, Ivanov said on Leningrad Television that former First Secretary of the Leningrad Oblast Committee Romanov, current Politburo member Ligachev, former Politburo member Solomentsov, and former Chairman of the Supreme Court of the USSR Tereshchenko were involved in criminal cases. The investigation report states that these accusations, which lack any objective evidence, are "a gross violation of the legally protected personal honor and dignity."

　　苏联报纸公布有关调查报告
    侦查员戈德良违反法纪
    新华社莫斯科５月２０日电  苏联报纸今天公布了苏联最高苏维埃主席团专门委员会就侦查员戈德良和伊万诺夫在调查案件时违反法纪一事所作的调查报告。
    报告提出两点建议：委托苏联检察院仔细调查有关对戈德良和伊万诺夫在侦查案件时违反法纪的所有控告，仔细调查有关涉及中央和地方党和国家机构负责工作人员犯罪集团的检举材料，并将结果通报。
    戈德良和伊万诺夫１９８３年９月开始调查乌兹别克共和国领导人受贿案件。为此成立的侦查组在乌兹别克工作５年多，追究了７０人的刑事责任，向法院提交了１９个案件，４０人受到审判。由于此案涉及勃列日涅夫女婿丘尔巴诺夫和前共和国党中央第一书记拉希多夫等人士，因此成了全苏轰动的事件。
    调查报告说，党中央和苏维埃机构曾接到公民对侦查组的控告，揭露戈德良等侦查员人为地扩大被指控犯有贪污罪的负责工作人员的范围，在侦查过程中搞逼供信。戈德良等人还就丘尔巴诺夫案企图对最高法院施加影响和在判刑后非难法院判刑过轻。
    伊万诺夫１９８９年５月１２日在列宁格勒电视台说，前列宁格勒州委第一书记罗曼诺夫、现任苏共中央政治局委员利加乔夫、前政治局委员索洛缅采夫和前苏联最高法院主席捷列比洛夫等人同刑事案件有关。调查报告称，这些无任何客观证据的责难是“粗暴违犯受法律保护的个人名誉和尊严”。
