In the southwestern part of South Korea, there is an island called Jin Island. The climate here is pleasant, and wild plants and animals are everywhere. However, what attracts people the most is the marvel of the sea water splitting open.

Every spring, a miracle occurs on Jin Island. The sea water connecting it to the neighboring island retreats, revealing a land bridge that is 2,800 meters long and 30 meters wide. Scientists believe that this phenomenon is caused by the changing seasons affecting the tides.

What is most interesting is that this marvel appears only once a year and lasts for about 30 minutes each time. Therefore, on the day when the sea water is expected to split, tens of thousands of domestic and international tourists flock to Jin Island to witness this extraordinary sight. It is said that in 1985 alone, over 150,000 people came to see it. For this reason, since 1984, a large bridge connecting Jin Island to the South Korean mainland has been completed, making it much more convenient for visitors to observe this rare spectacle.

　　珍岛奇观
    在南朝鲜西南有一个海岛叫珍岛，这里气候宜人，自然野生动植物四处皆是，然而它最吸引人的，却是海水自动裂开的奇观。
    每年春季的一天，奇迹便会在珍岛出现，连接它和邻岛的海水会自动退去，出现一条长２８００米、宽３０米的地岬。科学家认为，这种现象是由于季节转变而影响潮汐涨退形成的。
    最有意思的是，这种奇观每年仅出现一次，每次仅３０分钟左右，所以，在预定出现海水分裂现象的那天，成千上万的国内外游客会蜂拥珍岛，以一睹这绝世奇景为快。据说仅１９８５年，就有１５万多人前往观景。为此，从１９８４年起，一条横贯珍岛与南朝鲜本土的大桥已落成。游人要观赏这罕见奇景就方便多了。
