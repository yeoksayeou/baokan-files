Title: The Deepening of the Global Economic Adjustment

The global economic adjustment that began in the 1970s is now deepening. Several key indicators of this trend can be identified:

The developed countries have escaped stagflation and entered a new growth trajectory. In 1988, the economies of Western developed countries performed better than expected, with an annual growth rate of 4.1%. Judging from current trends, 1989 is also shaping up to be a good year. From various economic indicators over the past few years, it can be said that Western developed countries have entered a new growth trajectory since around 1985. The main indicators of this are: after years of effort, the vicious cycle of wages and prices has been broken, and the economic and social environment has improved; driven by the new technological revolution, equipment investment has begun to rise; the adjustment of economic structure has significantly improved enterprise efficiency; and the coordination of macroeconomic policies has reduced imbalances among developed countries.

The transition from a U.S.-dominated international economy to a coordinated U.S.-Europe-Japan economy. From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, the U.S.'s hegemonic position began to waver. This was followed by the 1971 August Nixon shock, which marked the beginning of the collapse of the post-war international monetary system, and Western countries entered a period of stagflation. Over the next 15 years, Western countries, under U.S. leadership, explored ways to rebuild the Western economy. The seven-nation summit that began in 1975 made significant efforts in this regard. However, due to differing national circumstances, it was difficult to adopt a unified approach, and the world economy remained in a passive situation. During this period, the U.S.'s economic position continued to decline, while Japan and Europe's positions rose, especially as Japan replaced the U.S. as the world's largest creditor nation, marking a rapid rise in Japan's position in the global economy. In this context, the U.S. increasingly needs to listen to Japan and Western Europe's opinions in international economic affairs, gradually forming a coordinated U.S.-Europe-Japan international economy.

The shift from trade protectionism to regional economic cooperation. In the first decade or so of the global economic adjustment, due to the varying adaptability of Western developed countries to the adjustment, trade protectionism emerged. For example, Japan had the strongest adaptability, with its competitiveness significantly increasing, while the U.S. and Europe were at a disadvantage and had to adopt trade protectionist measures. However, by the latter half of the 1980s, with the European Community proposing to achieve a unified large market by 1992, Western developed countries began to show a trend towards group formation. Additionally, the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement came into effect on January 1, 1989, and Japan and some Asian newly industrialized countries and regions advocated for the establishment of an East Asian economic circle. This group formation has a certain exclusivity, which is not conducive to international division of labor in the world economy, but it is different from the group formation of the imperialist era in the 1930s and the group formation based on ideology after the war. Although the European proposal to achieve a unified large market by 1992 originated from Japan's trade offensive and had trade protectionist elements, with the recovery of competitiveness in Europe and the U.S. and through their bargaining and difficult negotiations, the overall trend will be a weakening of trade protectionist momentum.

New ideas to ease the North-South stalemate. In the early stages of the adjustment, the gap between the North and the South widened further, with two-polarization becoming extremely pronounced, especially as huge debts continued to grow, becoming a global problem. With the deepening of the adjustment, there is a possibility of development towards easing. In 1985, the U.S. changed its previous hardline stance and proposed the Baker Plan, whose content was to increase new loans on the basis of debtors not repaying old loans. Various countries responded coldly, and it was not implemented. In 1988, Japan proposed the Miyazawa (Kiichi) idea. In March of this year, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Brady proposed an idea to solve the international debt crisis, whose content is: with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as backers, encouraging and assisting creditor banks to reach agreements with debtor countries to "voluntarily" reduce part of the debtors' principal and interest. The idea has been welcomed by international public opinion and brings a ray of light to overcoming the debt crisis.

The transition from a divided world market to a unified market based on commodity economy. In the early stages of the adjustment, socialist and capitalist countries independently carried out adjustments and reforms. Due to the shift from confrontation to dialogue in East-West relations and the deepening of economic exchanges, and due to socialist countries moving from the traditional product economy model to the socialist commodity economy model, the deepening of the economic adjustment will gradually form a unified global market. From the late 19th to the first half of the 20th century, it was the era of imperialism, and the world market was divided by imperialist powers, without forming a unified market. After the war, although a unified market was formed among Western developed countries and their economies developed rapidly, due to the confrontation between the two camps and the stalemate between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the world market remained divided. Entering the 1980s, due to the reform and opening-up policies of socialist countries, East-West economic relations based on commodity economy are developing, and it is hoped that a unified global market will emerge in the 21st century.

The deepening of the global economic adjustment has a bright future. However, various contradictions are intertwined, and establishing a new order will face many difficulties. If countries around the world do not make arduous efforts, the global economy will still not be able to enter a virtuous cycle.

### 世界经济大调整深化

　　世界经济大调整深化
    凌星光
    始发于７０年代的世界经济大调整，目前进一步深化。其重要标志，可列出以下几点：
    发达国家摆脱滞胀，走上新的增长轨道。１９８８年西方发达国家经济比预料的好，年增长率达到４．１％。从现在来看，１９８９年也是个好年头。从近几年的多项经济指标来看，西方发达国家可以说从１９８５年前后进入了新的增长轨道。其主要标志是：经过多年努力，工资和物价的恶性循环被切断，经济社会环境得到改善；在新技术革命的带动下，设备投资开始上升；经济结构的调整使企业效率得到较大提高；宏观经济政策的协调使发达国家间不平衡有所缩小。
    美国主导型国际经济向美欧日协调型过渡。６０年代末到７０年代初，美国的霸主地位开始动摇。接着以１９７１年８月尼克松冲击为标志，战后国际货币体系趋于瓦解，西方国家经济进入滞胀。之后１５年，西方国家在美国的主导下探索重建西方经济的途径，１９７５年开始的七国首脑会议为此作了不少努力。然而，各国情况不一，难以采取统一步调，世界经济没有摆脱被动局面。在此期间，美国的经济地位继续下降，日本和欧洲的地位不断上升，特别是日本代替美国成为世界最大债权国，标志着日本在世界经济中的地位急剧提高。在这样形势下，美国在国际经济事务中越来越需要听取日本和西欧的意见，从而逐渐形成美欧日协调型国际经济。
    从贸易保护主义趋向区域性经济合作。在世界经济进入大调整的头十几年中，由于西方发达国家对调整的适应能力各自不同，贸易保护主义抬头。例如，日本的适应能力最强，竞争力大幅度上升，而美国和欧洲处于劣势，不得不采取贸易保护主义措施。但到了８０年代后半期，以欧洲共同体提出１９９２年实现统一大市场为契机，西方发达国家开始出现集团化倾向。此外，美加自由贸易协定今年１月１日生效，日本和部分亚洲新兴工业国和地区提倡建立东亚经济圈。这种集团化有一定排他性，不利于世界经济的国际分工，但它不同于３０年代帝国主义时代的集团化，也不同于战后按意识形态形成的集团化。尽管西欧提出１９９２年实现统一大市场的起因来自日本的贸易攻势，有贸易保护主义因素，但随着欧洲和美国竞争力的恢复，又经过它们之间讨价还价和艰难交涉，总的发展趋势将是贸易保护主义的势头减弱。
    缓解南北僵局的新构想。在大调整的初期，南北差距进一步扩大，两极分化极为明显，特别是巨额债务越滚越大，成为世界性大难题。随着调整的深化，有可能向缓解方向发展。１９８５年美国改变过去强硬态度，提出贝克计划，其内容是在债务国尚未偿清旧贷款的基础上增加新贷款。对此，各国反应冷淡，未能付诸实施。１９８８年日本曾提出宫泽（喜一）构想。今年３月，美国财政部长布雷迪提出解决国际债务危机的构想，内容是：以世界银行和国际货币基金组织为后盾，鼓励并资助债权银行与债务国达成协议，“自愿”减免债务国的部分债务本金和利息。构想受到国际舆论欢迎，为克服债务危机带来了一道光明。
    东西分割的世界市场趋向于以商品经济为基础的统一市场。在大调整的初期，社会主义国家和资本主义国家各自独立地进行调整和改革。由于东西关系从对立走向对话以及经济交流日益加深，又由于社会主义国家摆脱传统的产品经济模式向社会主义商品经济模式过渡，经济大调整的深化将逐渐形成世界性统一市场。１９世纪末到２０世纪前半叶是帝国主义时代，世界市场被帝国主义列强分割，未形成统一市场。战后，尽管在西方发达国家之间形成统一市场，其经济得到迅速发展，但是由于两大阵营的对立和美苏两个超级大国的对峙，世界市场仍然被分割。进入８０年代后，由于社会主义国家实行改革开放政策，以商品经济为基础的东西经济关系正在发展，可望在２１世纪出现世界性统一市场。
    世界经济大调整深化，前景光明。但各种矛盾交织在一起，建立新秩序会遇到重重困难。如果世界各国不做艰苦努力，世界经济还是不能走上良性循环轨道。
