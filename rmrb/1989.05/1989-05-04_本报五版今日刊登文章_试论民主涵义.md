Today, our newspaper's fifth page publishes an article titled "On the Meaning of Democracy." Today, we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, inheriting and carrying forward the spirit of May Fourth. Apart from inheriting and carrying forward its patriotic spirit, the main task is to inherit and carry forward the spirit of "democracy" and "science" that it advocated, so that this spirit can take deeper roots, blossom, and bear fruit in the process of our country's modernization. To truly inherit and carry forward the democratic spirit of May Fourth, we must correctly understand the meaning of democracy. Today, our newspaper's fifth page publishes an article by Comrade Zheng Hangsheng, which discusses some views on the important issue of the meaning of democracy.
