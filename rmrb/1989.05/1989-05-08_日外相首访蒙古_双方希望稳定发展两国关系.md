Japanese Foreign Minister's First Visit to Mongolia
Both Sides Hope to Stabilize and Develop Bilateral Relations

Ulan Bator, May 7 (Xinhua) — Japanese Foreign Minister Uno Sōsuke concluded his visit to Mongolia and departed today for Beijing.

During his visit, Uno held talks with Mongolian Foreign Minister Gombosuren. Both sides noted that Mongolian-Japanese relations are developing normally and expressed hope to fully utilize the potential in political, economic, trade, cultural, and technological fields to stabilize and develop bilateral relations. Both sides agreed that a Japanese economic delegation will visit Mongolia.

Mongolian People's Great Hural President Batmonkh and Chairman of the Council of Ministers Sodnom received the Japanese foreign minister separately. Batmonkh said that while continuing to strengthen traditional friendly cooperative relations with socialist countries, Mongolia also hopes to develop relations with non-socialist countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He said Mongolia will continue to adhere to the policy of developing friendly relations with Japan on the basis of peaceful coexistence and expanding equal and mutually beneficial cooperation. Sodnom accepted an invitation to visit Japan.

Uno Sōsuke arrived in Mongolia yesterday morning for his visit. This is the first time a Japanese foreign minister has visited Mongolia.

In recent years, Mongolian-Japanese trade relations have seen new developments, with trade volume reaching $28 million, an increase of 14.5 times compared to 1972.
