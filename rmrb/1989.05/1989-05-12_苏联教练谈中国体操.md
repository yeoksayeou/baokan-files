Soviet Coach on Chinese Gymnastics

    The head coach of the Soviet men's gymnastics team, Arkadyev, said: "The Chinese team is our number one opponent. Because Chinese athletes have grasped the direction of gymnastics development, their movements are technically sound and their qualities are strong. Sino-Soviet cooperation can promote the development of world gymnastics."

    The head coach of the Soviet women's gymnastics team, Aleksandr, said: "The Chinese team's direction is correct, and their movements are technically advanced. The Chinese women's team's uneven bars are particularly outstanding, stronger than ours, with a taste of men's technical movements. After watching, it is inspiring. However, the women's team's specialized qualities are relatively poor, and sometimes they cannot fully demonstrate their techniques. Li Ning's technique is very good; he has made a contribution to the development of gymnastics. Currently, China does not have a standout figure. Gymnastics training is not just about talent; it also involves training methods and management. During the Seoul Olympics, some Chinese athletes smoked. If one is dedicated to the cause, one must make sacrifices. The techniques of athletes from both China and the Soviet Union are advanced, which plays a leading role in the development of gymnastics. Gymnastics should develop towards beauty and artistry; otherwise, it won't be interesting to watch."

　　苏联教练谈中国体操
    苏联男子体操队总教练阿尔卡耶夫：中国队是我们的头号对手。因为中国运动员把握住体操发展的方向，动作技术好，素质强。中苏合作能促进世界体操的发展。
    苏联女子体操队总教练亚历山大：中国队方向对头，动作技术先进。中国女队高低杠十分突出，比我们的强，动作有男子技术的味道，看后有启发。但女队专项素质较差，有时不能把技术很好地体现出来。李宁技术很好，他对体操的发展做出了贡献。现在中国没有突出的人物。体操训练不仅仅靠天才，还有训练方法和管理。汉城奥运会中国有些运动员抽烟。若献身事业，要作出牺牲。中苏两国运动员的技术先进，这对体操发展起主导作用。体操应向美的方向发展，向艺术化发展，否则就没什么好看的了。
