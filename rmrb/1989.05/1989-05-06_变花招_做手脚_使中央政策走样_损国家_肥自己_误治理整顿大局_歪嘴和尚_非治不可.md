    Tricks and Manipulations Distort Central Policies
    Harm the Nation, Benefit Oneself, and Mislead the Rectification and Reform
    “Crooked Monks” Must Be Stopped

    According to reports from some cities' economic circles, central policies often get distorted when they reach the lower levels, becoming a major obstacle to the rectification and reform efforts.

    A certain unit planned to build a garden apartment. During the cleanup of fixed asset investment projects last year, it was listed as a project to be suspended. However, since Sino-foreign joint ventures are not included in the suspension list, the unit quickly “found” a foreign partner, transforming the garden apartment into a joint venture project. As a result, construction began as planned.

    A factory in a certain province sold high-standard housing at low prices to the factory's leading cadres, euphemistically calling it “implementing housing commercialization.”

    After the state imposed a banquet tax, some units tampered with receipts or transferred expenses to individual restaurants, guesthouses, and canteens that do not levy the banquet tax. When the state decided to control the purchase of small cars, some people used public funds to buy cars in the name of individuals, evading the control and examination. When the state required the reduction of administrative expenses and conference fees, some units shifted the costs to lower-level enterprises. One city's refrigerator factory almost had to “bleed” nearly ten thousand yuan each year to host meetings for higher-level management departments.

    There are also instances of central policies being replaced with different measures. For example, the state advocates for enterprises to optimize their labor composition and implement bidding and contracting, but some people turn this into “nepotism.”

    Economic circles point out that those “crooked monks” must be dealt with according to laws and regulations, and they must not be allowed to gain benefits.

　　变花招　做手脚　使中央政策走样   
    损国家　肥自己　误治理整顿大局    
    “歪嘴和尚”非治不可
    据新华社北京电  （记者夏俊生、杨青）据一些城市的经济界人士反映，中央的政策一到下面往往就走样，这已成为当前阻碍治理整顿工作和深化改革的一大障碍。
    某单位准备兴建一座花园公寓，在去年清理固定资产投资项目时被列为停缓建项目。但由于中外合资项目不在停缓建范围，这个单位便以最快的速度“找”到一家国外合作伙伴，花园公寓摇身变成了中外合资项目，结果照样破土动工。
    某省一家工厂，把建好的高标准住宅低价卖给厂里的领导干部，美其名为“实行住宅商品化”。
    国家开征宴席税，一些单位便在发票上做手脚，或转移到不征宴席税的个体饭馆、招待所食堂；国家决定控购小轿车，一些人便借个人名义用公款买车，躲过控办审查关；国家要求压缩行政经费、会议费，一些单位便把费用向下面的企业转嫁，有的单位连机关人员出差费都要让企业报销。某市一家电冰箱厂几乎每年都要为承办上面主管部门的会议而“放血”近万元。
    还有对中央政策偷梁换柱的。譬如国家提倡企业优化劳动组合、搞招标承包，一些人就把它变为“亲化组合”。
    经济界人士指出，对那些“歪嘴和尚”要绳之以法纪、政纪，决不能让这些人捞到实惠。
