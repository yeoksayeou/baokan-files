Khomeini in Hospital for Surgery, Condition Dangerous, No Successor in Sight

	The Associated Press reports from Cyprus that Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini underwent surgery today due to internal bleeding. His son stated that Khomeini's "condition is good and will improve." However, other Iranians say that Khomeini has "lost too much blood" and is in a "dangerous" condition.

	Iranian President Khamenei today called on the nation's 50 million people to "pray to God for the success of the surgery." Tehran Television broadcast footage of Khomeini receiving an IV in his hospital bed. Khomeini's son said, "We have decided not to hide anything from the people."

	It is reported that after Khomeini personally designated his successor, Montazeri, was dismissed by Khomeini, the 89-year-old Iranian leader currently has no successor.

　　霍梅尼住院开刀状况危险
    眼下后继无人
    本报华盛顿５月２３日电  记者仓立德报道：美联社塞浦路斯消息，伊朗领袖霍梅尼今天因内出血接受了外科手术。他的儿子说，目前霍梅尼的“状况很好，将来会更好”。但其他伊朗人说，霍梅尼“失血过多”，处于“危险”状况。
    伊朗总统哈梅内伊今天要求全国５０００万人民为手术成功“向真主感恩祈祷”。德黑兰电视台播出霍梅尼在病床输液镜头。霍梅尼的儿子说，“我们决定不向人民隐瞒任何事情”。
    据悉，在霍梅尼亲自指定的接班人蒙塔泽里被霍梅尼罢黜后，这位８９岁的伊朗领袖眼下还没有接班人。
