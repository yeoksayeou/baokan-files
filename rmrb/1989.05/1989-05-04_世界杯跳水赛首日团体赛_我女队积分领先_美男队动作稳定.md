The first day of the sixth World Cup diving competition began this morning with the men's 1-meter springboard and women's 10-meter platform team events. The Chinese women's team leads in points, with Xu Yánméi and Chén Xiǎodān ranking first and second in the platform event. Lán Wèi and Tán Liángdé rank second and third in the men's 1-meter springboard event.

The men's and women's team events in this World Cup include the 1-meter springboard, 3-meter springboard, and 10-meter platform, with the total score being the sum of the three events. Each team sends two athletes to compete in one event. Over 80 athletes from 20 countries, including China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, will compete for nine gold medals over four days.

Xu Yánméi is the champion of the women's platform event in the previous World Cup and the Seoul Olympics and has rich competition experience. In the morning's compulsory dives, she performed beautifully and led the scores by a significant margin. In the afternoon's optional dives, her final dive—a backflip with two and a half twists—was flawed. Despite this, she still topped the list with a total score of 422.58 points. Chén Xiǎodān ranked second with 402.87 points. The third and fourth places went to Canada's Anna Dacychin and the United States' Wendy Wyland.

The men's 1-meter springboard team event today had 11 rounds. In the morning's five rounds of compulsory dives, Tán Liángdé and Lán Wèi led with 223.47 and 220.05 points, respectively. However, in the afternoon's six rounds of optional dives, Tán Liángdé made two mistakes, while Mark Lenzi of the U.S. team consistently performed high and stable dives, earning high scores. As a result, Lenzi ranked first with 600.18 points, Lán Wèi second with 576.87 points, and Tán Liángdé third with 570.93 points. Pat Evans of the U.S. team ranked fourth. The U.S. men's team's total points were one point ahead of the Chinese team.

China's head coach, Xu Yìmíng, expressed satisfaction with Tán Liángdé and especially Lán Wèi's performance in the 1-meter springboard event, as they had only started formal training for this event at the beginning of the year.

This World Cup diving competition is being held at the best swimming pool in the United States, the Indiana University Natatorium, but the number of spectators watching the first day's competition was small, and the atmosphere inside the venue was somewhat subdued.

　　世界杯跳水赛首日团体赛    
    我女队积分领先　美男队动作稳定
    新华社印第安纳波利斯５月３日电（记者陆文岳）第六届世界杯跳水赛今天上午以男子团体１米跳板和女子团体１０米跳台赛拉开序幕，中国女队团体积分领先，许艳梅和陈晓丹个人积分列跳台第一、二位，兰卫和谭良德积分列男子１米跳板第二、三位。
    本届世界杯赛的男女团体赛包含１米跳板、３米跳板和１０米跳台３个项目，以３项积分之和计算团体总分，每个队派两名选手参加一个项目的比赛。中美苏等２０个国家８０多名选手将在４天的比赛里争夺９块金牌。
    许艳梅是上届世界杯和汉城奥运会女子跳台冠军，比赛经验丰富。在上午规定动作比赛中，她姿态优美，分数遥遥领先，在下午自选动作比赛中，她的最后一个动作——面对台向后翻腾两周半屈体——失误较大。尽管如此，她还是以４２２．５８的总分高居第一，陈晓丹以４０２．８７分居第二。列第三和第四位的是加拿大的安娜·达西欣和美国的温迪·怀兰。
    男子团体１米跳板今天进行了１１轮比赛，在上午的５轮规定动作中，谭良德和兰卫分别以２２３．４７分和２２０．０５分领先。但在下午６轮自选动作比赛中，谭良德两次失误，而美国队的马克·伦齐以高超而平稳的动作不断获得高分。结果，伦齐以６００．１８分列第一位，兰卫以５７６．８７分居第二，谭良德以５７０．９３分列第三，美国队的派特·伊文思第四。美国男团总积分比中国队领先一分。
    中国队总教练徐益明对谭良德尤其是兰卫在１米跳板赛中所取得的成绩表示满意，因为他们是从今年初才开始这个项目的正规训练的。
    本届世界杯跳水赛是在全美最好的印第安纳大学游泳馆举行的，但观看第一天比赛的观众甚少，场内气氛比较冷清。
