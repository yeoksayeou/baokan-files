Title: A Thousand Kinds of Life, Choices Differ

Life is full of countless possibilities, and everyone's choices are different.

Eight or nine months ago, I graduated from Chongqing University and was assigned to the city of Xiangfan in northwestern Hubei. When I reported to my unit, I was told everywhere that they were overstaffed. After being passed around like a "ball" for over a month, I, a student majoring in secretarial studies in the social sciences, was finally taken in by a struggling construction company.

On a moonlit night with a gentle breeze, I walked alone on the street, listening to the vendors' cries, and I was struck by a thought: although I had secured a job, with just a few dozen yuan in salary in today's world of soaring prices, what else could I do besides eating? A friend took the opportunity to advise me: "Why not sell snacks?"

I bought a stove, obtained a license, and purchased tables, chairs, pots, bowls, ladles, and basins. Finally, the stall was set up. On the first day, I surprisingly made 80 cents. Classmates heard that I was selling snacks and came to my stall to eat. They all said it tasted good, but they couldn't understand: in school, you had your clothes and bedding washed by others, and after studying for a few years, how did you end up doing this? Family members came to visit and, upon learning of my new venture, were astonished. They couldn't help but give me a long lecture. My response was simple: "Who cares!"

The small stall is like a stage but also a world. I encounter all kinds of people, coming and going in a hurry. They have joy and sorrow. I can hear various voices: some praise reform, others complain about soaring prices. Of course, there are also "scandalous news" and even romantic affairs.

Four months ago, I was a student in a key university majoring in secretarial studies, but now I am a waiter. This brief change tells me that everyone can find their own way of living, and everyone has their own understanding of life. A university student becoming a waiter is just one example. When one person after another, driven by hunger, comes to the stall, eats their fill, and leaves satisfied, I am proud of the labor I have exchanged for my customers.

I am not following a trend by giving up my iron rice bowl. I blame no one, nor do I sigh over my fate. What I want to learn is how to cope with any situation and any sudden changes. After all, life often involves cause and effect, gains and losses. A person's life has many opportunities, and the key is not to give up effort.

　　生活千万种
    选择各不同
    罗志刚
    八九个月前，我从重庆大学毕业，被分配到鄂西北重镇襄樊。当我到单位报到时，处处都喊超编，饱尝一个多月被人当作“皮球”踢来踢去的滋味后，我这个社会科学系文秘专业的学生被一家风雨飘摇的建筑公司看中。
    月白风清之夜，我独自漫步街上，听着卖小吃的吆喝声，不禁一震：虽说我有了个饭碗，但就凭这几十元工资置身物价飞涨的今天，除去吃饭还能做些什么呢？一个哥们儿趁机开导：何不卖小吃去！
    买炉子，办执照，购桌椅、锅、碗、瓢、盆。摊子终于建起来了。第一天居然赚了八毛钱。同学听说我卖起小吃，来到摊子上吃一顿，都说有点味道，只是想不通：在校衣服、被子都请人洗，上了几年学，现在怎么有了这个雅兴？家人专程来看望，得知我干起这行当，不禁愕然。少不了一番苦口婆心的劝说。我的回答很简单：“管它呢！”
    小小的摊子像个舞台却也是一个世界。我接触各种各样的人，来得匆匆，去得也匆匆。他们有欢乐，也有忧愁。我能听到各种心声：或称赞改革，或埋怨物价暴涨。当然也有“花边新闻”，甚至桃色事件。
    四个月前我是一个重点大学文秘专业的学生，如今却成了一个跑堂的伙计，短暂的变化告诉我，每个人都可以找到自己的生活方式，每个人都有自己对生活的理解。大学生跑堂，正是其中之一。当一个个被饥饿驱赶到摊子上的人吃饱后满意离去时，我为自己的劳动换来的顾客而自豪。
    抛掉铁饭碗，我不是赶时髦。我不怪任何人，也不叹息命运，我要学会的是在任何一种条件下和某种突然性到来时能应付裕如。更何况，人生常常因果相依，得失互补。一个人一生的机遇是很多的，关键在于不要放弃努力。
