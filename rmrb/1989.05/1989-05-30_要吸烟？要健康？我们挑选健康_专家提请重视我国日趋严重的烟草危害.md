Today, many experts at the "World No-Tobacco Day" symposium held by the National Hygiene and Health Committee earnestly stated that regarding the tobacco issue, China should formulate a national policy.

Health Minister Chen Minzhang said: "Currently, there are over 250 million smokers in China, and the number of passive smokers is even greater. Controlling tobacco hazards in such a large population is not enough with just one 'No-Tobacco Day' to strengthen publicity every year. We should mobilize the entire society to adopt long-term and effective measures."

Professor Wu Yingkai of the Beijing Heart and Lung Research Center said: "Smoking creates public hazards and is an uncivilized behavior. The area for growing grain and cotton in our country is decreasing, while the area for growing tobacco is increasing. Why can't we grow more vegetables and soybeans? Can we strictly prohibit the import of foreign cigarettes?"

Professor Huang Guojun of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences Cancer Research Institute said:

"In recent years, the number of lung cancer patients has been increasing by nearly 2,000 cases per year, with 70% to 80% of these cases caused by smoking. Early diagnosis of lung cancer is difficult, but it can be prevented. The most effective prevention is to not smoke or to quit smoking as early as possible. Currently, there is a rumor in society that long-term smokers will get lung cancer once they quit, which is absurd and perhaps a strategy used by some 'old smokers' to interfere."

Dr. Kein of the World Health Organization's office in China pointed out: The organization's slogan is "To smoke or to be healthy? We choose health!" From now on, "World No-Tobacco Day" will be held on the day before Children's Day each year to remind people to pay attention to the harm of tobacco, especially to children.

    要吸烟？要健康？我们挑选健康
    专家提请重视我国日趋严重的烟草危害
    本报北京5月30日讯  记者艾笑报道：今天，许多专家在全国爱卫会召开的“世界无烟草日”座谈会上恳切地说，对于烟草问题，要拿出中国的国策来。
    卫生部长陈敏章说：“中国现有2.5亿多人吸烟，被动吸烟的人数则更多。在这么大人群中控制住烟草的危害，只靠每年一个‘无烟日’强化一次宣传是不够的。应当动员全社会，采取长期的有效措施。”
    北京心肺研究中心吴英恺教授说：“吸烟是制造公害，是不文明行为。我国的粮棉种植面积在不断减少，而烟草种植面积倒不断增加。为什么不能多种些菜和大豆？能不能严禁外国烟进口？”
    中国医科院肿瘤研究所黄国俊教授说：
  “近年来，肺癌患者以每年增加近2000例的速度增长，其中70％—80％是吸烟引起的。肺癌的早期诊断很困难，但可以预防。最有效的预防是不吸烟或及早停止吸烟。现在社会上有一种传言，说长期吸烟的人一旦戒烟就会得肺癌，这是荒谬的，或许是某些‘老烟鬼’的干扰策略。”
    世界卫生组织驻中国代表基恩博士指出：该组织提出的口号是“要吸烟，还是要健康？我们挑选健康！”今后每年的“世界无烟日”都定在儿童节的前一天，以便提醒人们注意烟草尤其对儿童的危害。
