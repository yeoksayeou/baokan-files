To strengthen product quality management, China has implemented a production permit system for important industrial products since 1984. It is understood that more than 20,000 production permits have been issued to over 15,000 enterprises nationwide. The products within the scope of issuance total 400 varieties, of which 117 have completed the certification process. However, some enterprises and sales units are still producing and selling uncertified products in violation of the "Interim Provisions on the Administration of Industrial Product Production Permits," leading to a large number of substandard goods flooding the market and seriously endangering public safety.

The Donghua Machinery Processing Plant in Jinan, Shandong Province, produces boilers without a permit, resulting in poor quality. An explosion occurred at the Tangcun Bone Glue Factory in Bó County due to the use of boilers produced by this plant, causing 5 deaths and 4 severe injuries, with direct economic losses reaching 300,000 yuan. Farmers in the suburbs of Puyang, Henan Province, used substandard "compound fertilizer" produced by a certain chemical fertilizer plant in Zhengzhou, causing 45,000 mu of wheat seedlings to wither and die.

To stop the production and sale of uncertified products, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Materials, the Ministry of Commerce, and the State Price Bureau recently jointly issued a "Notice on the Nationwide Investigation and Handling of the Production and Sale of Products Without Production Permits." The notice decides to severely investigate and handle the production and sale of uncertified products. The scope of investigation is limited to the 117 varieties of products that have completed the certification process since the implementation of the production permit system in 1984. The focus is on those uncertified production enterprises that seek to make huge profits, produce shoddy goods, and harm users and consumers, causing serious consequences, as well as units and individuals that sell uncertified products. For those uncertified enterprises whose product quality is still acceptable or can meet the certification conditions after rectification, after being fined according to relevant regulations, they can be allowed to complete the certification procedures; those that do not meet the certification conditions after assessment will be ordered to stop production, and the industrial and commercial administrative authorities will revoke the business license of the enterprise or remove the item from the business scope of the business license. The seized uncertified products will be handled by the inspection unit according to their actual use value, and measures such as destruction or graded price reduction will be taken.

　　一些单位生产销售无证产品
    国家技监局等部门决定查处
    本报北京５月２０日讯  记者朱剑红、王锦鹄报道：为加强产品质量管理，我国自１９８４年起对重要工业产品实施了生产许可证制度。据了解，目前已向全国１．５万多个企业颁发了２万多张生产许可证，列入发放范围的产品有４００种，其中１１７种已结束发证工作。但是，目前仍有一些企业和经销单位违反《工业产品生产许可证试行条例》的规定，继续生产和销售无证产品，造成大量低劣商品充斥市场，严重影响人民生命安全。
    山东省济南市东华机械加工厂无证生产锅炉，质量低劣。博县唐村骨胶厂使用该厂生产的锅炉引起爆炸，造成５人死亡、４人重伤的恶性事件，直接经济损失达３０万元。河南濮阳市郊农民使用郑州某化肥厂无证生产的劣质“复合肥”，使４．５万亩麦苗枯死绝收。
    为制止生产和销售无证产品的行为，最近，国家技术监督局、国家工商行政管理局、财政部、物资部、商业部、国家物价局六部门联合发出《关于在全国范围内查处生产和销售无生产许可证产品的通知》，决定对生产和销售无证产品的行为严肃查处。查处的范围限于１９８４年实施生产许可证制度以来，目前已结束发证的１１７种产品。重点是那些以牟取暴利为目的、粗制滥造、坑害用户和消费者、造成严重后果的无证生产企业，以及经销无证产品的单位和个人。对于那些产品质量尚属合格、或经过整顿可以达到取证条件的无证企业，在按有关规定处以罚款后，可允许其履行取证手续；经考核不符合发证条件的，按规定停产，由工商行政管理机关吊销企业营业执照或从营业执照的经营范围中撤消该项目。对查封的无证产品，经检测单位判定，将根据实际使用价值，分别采取销毁或分等降价销售等办法处理。
