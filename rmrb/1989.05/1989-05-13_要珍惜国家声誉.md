	Cherish the Nation's Reputation
	Zhong Yan

	The Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, Gorbachev, will arrive in our country tomorrow for an official visit. Some people are concerned that the strikes and protests by students in some universities in the capital and other places have not yet completely stopped, and whether this will interfere with the upcoming major state activity. It cannot be said that their concerns are entirely unfounded, because this is a matter that concerns the nation's reputation.

	The mutual visits of leaders between countries are important state activities, and any country attaches great importance to them, providing a proper and grand reception for visiting dignitaries. Every item on the itinerary of a visiting dignitary is arranged in advance through bilateral consultations. To ensure that the visit proceeds smoothly according to plan, it is required that citizens cooperate, which has become a customary practice in international exchanges.

	Undoubtedly, receiving foreign dignitaries requires a stable, harmonious, and normal atmosphere. This requires the joint efforts of all citizens. Because it concerns the honor of the nation, anyone with a modicum of patriotism can understand the importance of the situation and not allow major state activities to be disrupted. To take a recent example, in March 1986, when Chairman Li Xiannian of our country visited a friendly country in South Asia for a state visit, there was a large-scale strike at that time. However, before Li Xiannian arrived in the capital, the strike was called off, and Li Xiannian received a normal welcome as arranged according to protocol.

	The high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union marks the normalization of relations between the two countries and is a major event that has attracted worldwide attention. We believe that every patriotic citizen of our country will understand that this major state activity should not be disrupted. This is also what our distinguished guests hope for. Soviet leaders have repeatedly stated that they will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Anyone who does anything that damages the nation's reputation will be highly unpopular. We hope that all the people of the nation, including the broad masses of young people, will prioritize the overall situation. In matters concerning the nation's reputation, other issues should be subordinated to the bigger picture. Moreover, some issues are being studied and addressed by the government. Under these circumstances, if we do not first consider the bigger picture but act impulsively, it will have very bad consequences. This is something that all patriots do not want to see.

### 要珍惜国家声誉

　　要珍惜国家声誉
    锺岩
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫明天将前来我国进行正式访问。有人担心，首都和一些地方的高校学生罢课、游行尚未完全停息，会不会使即将到来的这次重大的国事活动受到干扰。不能说他们的这种担心完全是多余的，因为这是关系到国家声誉的大事情。
    国家之间领导人的相互访问是一项重要的国事活动，任何国家都十分重视，对来访的国宾给予合乎礼仪的隆重接待。国宾访问的每项日程都事先经双方协商做好安排。为使访问按照计划顺利进行，要求国民加以配合，这已成为国际交往中的惯例。
    毫无疑问，接待外国贵宾需要有一个安定、和谐的正常气氛。这就需要全体公民来共同创造。因为事关国家的荣誉，稍有爱国心的人都是能够识大体、顾大局，不使重大的国事活动受到干扰。远的不说，近几年国际上就不乏这样的例子。
    仅以１９８６年３月８日我国李先念主席到南亚一个友好国家进行国事访问为例。当时正值该国发生大规模的罢市。但是，在李先念主席抵达首都之前，罢市宣布停止，李先念主席受到了按礼仪安排的正常欢迎。
    中苏高级会晤，标志着中苏两国关系的正常化，是一件举世瞩目的大事。我们相信，我国每一个爱国的公民都会懂得，不能使这次重大的国事活动受到干扰。这显然也是我们的贵宾所希望的。苏联领导人就曾经反复表示决不干预别国的内部事务。谁要是做出任何有损国家声誉的事情，都是极不得人心的。希望我们全国人民包括广大青年人能以大局为重，在事关国家声誉的大事面前，其他的问题都要先服从大道理。况且有一些问题，政府正着手研究解决。在这种情况下，如果不首先考虑大道理，而任凭意气用事，就将会造成很坏的后果。这是所有爱国者都不愿看到的。
