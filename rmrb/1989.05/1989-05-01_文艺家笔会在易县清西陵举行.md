Recently, at the invitation of the literary department of this newspaper, more than 30 literary critics, writers, and artists gathered in Yi County, Hebei Province, at the Qing Western Tombs, an area known for its lush spring scenery, towering pines and cypresses, and clear waters and mountains. They held a literary artists' pen conference. Participants discussed contemporary art, the fate of Chinese intellectuals since the May Fourth Movement, the academic style of modern China, the future of traditional culture, and the attitudes and methods of scholars' research, all of which are current topics of concern in the cultural sphere. During the conference, scholars expressed their own views and engaged in vigorous debates, sometimes becoming quite heated, but they all agreed that this was a sign of equal dialogue and discussion, which also deepened their understanding and friendship. They also discussed with relevant officials from the Baoding region, Yi County, and the Qing Western Tombs how to develop Yi County and the Western Tombs' tourism and culture, and accelerate economic and cultural development.

　　文艺家笔会在易县清西陵举行
    本报讯  不久前，应本报文艺部的邀请，３０余位文艺评论家、作家、艺术家，来到春意盎然、松柏参天、山清水秀的河北省易县清西陵，举行文艺家笔会。大家就当代艺术、“五四”以来中国知识分子的命运、中国现代的学术品格、传统文化的前途以及学者治学的态度和方法等日前文化界关注的问题展开争论。笔会期间，学者们各抒己见，相互辩驳，有时几近面红耳赤，但一致认为这才是一种平等的对话和讨论，而且更加深了感情和了解。他们还和保定地区、易县、清西陵的有关同志共同探讨了如何开发易县和西陵的旅游文化，加快经济和文化的发展等问题。
