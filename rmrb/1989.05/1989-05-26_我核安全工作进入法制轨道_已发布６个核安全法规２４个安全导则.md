After several years of effort, China's nuclear safety management and assurance industry has taken initial shape. The safety supervision and management of civilian nuclear facilities nationwide have begun to enter the legal track.

In recent years, the state has prioritized the formulation of nuclear safety regulations. Currently, six nuclear safety regulations and 24 safety guidelines have been issued, including the "Regulations on the Supervision and Management of Civilian Nuclear Facilities of the People's Republic of China," the "Regulations on the Control of Nuclear Materials of the People's Republic of China," and the "Safety Regulations for the Design, Operation, Site Selection, and Quality Assurance of Nuclear Power Plants." Additionally, a series of regulations such as the "Atomic Energy Law" and the "Regulations on Nuclear Accident Emergency Management" are in the process of being formulated.

According to the "Regulations on the Supervision and Management of Civilian Nuclear Facilities," the state implements a licensing system for civilian nuclear facilities and nuclear materials. The entire process of site selection, construction, commissioning, operation, and decommissioning of nuclear power plants will be strictly subject to safety review and supervision, and licenses will only be issued to those that meet safety standards.

The domestically designed and constructed 300,000 kilowatt pressurized water reactor Qin Shan Nuclear Power Plant and two 900,000 kilowatt pressurized water reactors in Guangdong's Dayawan Nuclear Power Station have all been approved and issued construction licenses.

A responsible official from the State Nuclear Safety Administration said that in the short term, the focus of nuclear safety work will be on the safety supervision of commissioning and operation. Strengthened supervision will also be implemented for the control of nuclear materials and the facilities for the nuclear fuel cycle.

　　我核安全工作进入法制轨道
    已发布６个核安全法规２４个安全导则
    据新华社北京５月２６日电  （实习生包安隽）经过几年的努力，我国的核安全管理和保障事业已经初成规模。全国民用核设施的安全监督管理工作，已开始进入法制轨道。
    几年来，国家把核安全法规的制订摆在核安全工作的优先地位。目前已经发布了《中华人民共和国民用核设施监督管理条例》、《中华人民共和国核材料管制条例》和《核电站设计、运行、选址和质量保证安全规定》等６个核安全法规、２４个安全导则。另外《原子能法》、《核事故应急管理条例》等一系列法规正在制订之中。
    根据《民用核设施监督管理条例》规定，国家对民用核设施和核材料实行许可证制度。核电厂的选址、建造、调试、运行和退役的全过程，都将严格实行安全审查和监督，符合安全的才能发给许可证。
    我国自行设计和建造的３０万千瓦压水堆的秦山核电厂和两座９０万千瓦压水堆的广东大亚湾核电站都已批准并颁发了建造许可证。
    国家核安全局负责人说，今后短期内核安全工作重点，将放在调试运行的安全监督方面。对核材料的管制、核燃料的循环设施也要采取加强监督工作。
