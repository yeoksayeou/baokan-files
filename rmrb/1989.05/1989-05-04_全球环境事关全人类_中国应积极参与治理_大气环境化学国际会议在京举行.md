People's Daily, Beijing, May 4th.

The protection of the global atmosphere requires human awakening, international cooperation, and global action. The "International Symposium on Global and Regional Atmospheric Environmental Chemistry," initiated by Chinese and American atmospheric chemists and hosted by the Chinese Society for Environmental Sciences, was held yesterday at the Beijing Science Hall.

曲格平, Director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, spoke at the conference. He said that the "greenhouse effect," which poses a significant potential threat to human survival and development, is closely linked to people's production and living activities. Solving the "greenhouse effect" and preventing global warming requires adjusting human production and living patterns. China is a major energy-consuming country, and there is still great potential to improve energy utilization methods. This is a starting point for us to participate in solving global environmental problems.

It is reported that the Atmospheric Environmental Chemistry Conference will become an international series of conferences, starting this year, to be held every two years.

　　全球环境事关全人类    
    中国应积极参与治理    
    大气环境化学国际会议在京举行
    本报北京５月４日讯  记者谢联辉报道：全球大气环境保护，需要人类觉醒，国际合作，全球行动。由中美大气化学家发起、中国环境科学学会主办的“全球和区域大气环境化学国际学术会议”，昨天在北京科学会堂举行。
    我国国家环境保护局局长曲格平在会上讲了话。他说，对人类的生存和发展构成重大潜在威胁的“温室效应”，与人们的生产和生存活动紧密相连，解决“温室效应”，防止全球变暖，需要通过调整人类的生产和生活方式来实现。中国是能源消耗大国，对改善能源利用方式还有很大潜力，这是我们参与解决全球环境问题的一个基点。
    据悉，大气环境化学会议将成为国际性的系列会议，自今年开始，每两年召开一次。
