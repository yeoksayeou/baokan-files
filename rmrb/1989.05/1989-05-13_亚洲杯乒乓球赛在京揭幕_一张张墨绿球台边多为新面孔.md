Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th.

	The seventh Asian Cup Table Tennis Tournament opened tonight at the Shijingshan Sports Gymnasium in Beijing. Many new faces appeared on the green tables, as each country and region sent teams primarily composed of young players, clearly aiming to train their second-tier athletes.

	Only two matches in the first round of the group stage drew significant attention. Taiwan's straight grip, short-pimped, near-table attacker Xie Wentang made a comeback, defeating Malaysia's veteran Lim Chun Liang 2-1. Both players are of Chinese descent, but the audience's applause was directed at Xie Wentang. China's female team's penholder chopper Ding Yaping defeated North Korea's strong player Ri Myong Suk by a 2-point margin. The third set was tied at 20-20. The four-day Asian Cup tournament began today, with two days of group stage matches followed by knockout rounds to determine the men's and women's singles champions.

　　亚洲杯乒乓球赛在京揭幕
    一张张墨绿球台边多为新面孔
    据新华社北京５月１３日电（记者王俊璞）亚洲兵坛一张张新面孔今晚出现在北京石景山体育馆。各国家和地区均派出以年轻选手为主的队伍参加第七届亚洲杯乒乓球赛，显然是为了锻炼第二梯队。
    小组第一轮比赛仅有两场球引人注目。中国台北直拍正胶近台快攻手谢文堂后来居上，以２∶１险胜马来西亚老将林俊良。两位选手均是炎黄子孙，但观众把掌声都给了谢文堂。中国女队横拍削球手丁亚萍以２分的优势击败了朝鲜队颇有实力的李美淑，双方在第三局曾打成２０平。为期４天的亚洲杯赛从今天开始，先进行两天小组赛，然后进行淘汰赛决出男、女单打冠军。
