	One-Person Police Station
	The town of Saffern in New York State has a population of 1,900 people. Though small, it has all the necessary amenities, including a police station. The 31-year-old Ms. Kristine Buttina is both the chief and the sole officer. Her primary duty is to patrol the town at night. Since taking office in August 1988, Buttina has handled over 50 complaints, dealt with several cases of speeding fines, and arrested one individual for driving under the influence of alcohol. In the United States, policing is predominantly a male profession, but Buttina has grown to love her job. The tranquil town and its kind-hearted residents find that having such a gentle female officer is more than enough.

　　一人警察局
    美国纽约州的塞芬纳是个拥有１９００人的小镇。麻雀虽小，五脏俱全，镇上亦设有一所警察局。３１岁的克列斯特·布蒂娜女士既是局长，又是唯一的警官。她的主要工作是晚上在镇上巡逻。布蒂娜自１９８８年８月上任以来，已受理５０余件申诉案，处理一些超车罚款案，并逮捕过一名酒醉后开车的人。在美国，警察大多是男性的职业，但布蒂娜女士却爱上了自己的工作，平静的小镇和善良的镇民也觉得有这样一位温柔的女性警官就足够了。　（马绍坤）
