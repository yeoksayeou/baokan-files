Xinhua News Agency, Lusaka, May 13th.

The South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) has formed a 17-member "think tank" to guide the national elections for Namibian independence.

The team is led by the former director of the United Nations Institute for Namibia, Hage Geingob, and includes members of the SWAPO Central Committee and other senior officials.

Geingob stated that the team will leave for Namibia and establish SWAPO's election headquarters next month. SWAPO will also set up regional offices to coordinate and direct election activities nationwide.

He expressed confidence in SWAPO's ability to win the November national elections, citing their experience in election activities.

Xinhua News Agency, Windhoek, May 13th.

A South African military spokesman announced today in Windhoek that South African forces have ceased all military operations against SWAPO guerrillas in northern Namibia.

The spokesman said that South African troops, under the supervision of the United Nations Assistance Mission, are withdrawing from Namibia.

According to the agreement reached two weeks ago between Angola, Cuba, and South Africa, South African forces in northern Namibia must remain within their bases starting from 6 AM on the 13th.

The agreement also stipulates that all SWAPO guerrillas must stay within their bases north of the 16th parallel in Angola.

The tripartite committee will hold another meeting on the 15th near the border between Angola and Namibia.
