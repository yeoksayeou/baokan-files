On May 1st this year, Austrians did not flock to the lakesides to celebrate the start of the swimming season as they usually do, but instead had to dig out their winter clothes to keep warm, as winter returned.

Since the end of April, a powerful cold front has swept in from the east, engulfing the entire country of Austria. The winds howled, and the snow fell heavily. In the western mountainous regions, the new snow reached a depth of one meter, while in some central areas, the snowfall amounted to half a meter. Cars had to switch back to winter tires, and some even had to install snow chains.

Last winter, Austria saw relatively little snowfall, and the weather was not particularly cold. This spring arrived early, but just as the season of warmth and blossoms began, winter suddenly returned, catching everyone off guard. In recent days, due to slippery roads, traffic accidents have been frequent. In the western highlands, roads that had just been cleared of snow and prepared for reopening were once again deeply covered in fresh snow.

The weather forecast for May 2nd brought good news: a warm current would enter Austria on May 3rd, indicating that although winter's second coming was fierce, its duration would not be long.

　　冷风飕飕　大雪纷扬     
    奥地利“五一”穿冬装
    今年的５月１日，奥地利人没有像往年那样涌向湖畔，欢庆游泳季节的开始，而是从衣柜里翻出冬装避寒，冬天又回来了。
    从４月底起，强劲的寒潮从东方滚滚而来，袭击奥地利全国。冷风飕飕，大雪纷扬。西部山区新雪深达１米，中部的一些地区降雪量也达半米。汽车不得不又改换冬季轮胎，甚至装上防滑铁链。
    去年冬天，奥地利降雪较少，天气也不太寒冷，今年春天又来得早。但就在这春暖花开时节，冬天又突然复归，人们实没料到。这几天因路滑，交通事故不断发生，西部高山地区刚刚清除积雪，准备开放行车的山路又深深被新雪覆盖。
    ２日的天气预报给人们带来了好消息，暖流３日将进入奥地利，冬天的“二进宫”虽猛，但时间还不算长。
