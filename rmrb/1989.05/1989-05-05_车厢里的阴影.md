Shadows in the Carriage

By Zhu Sixiong, Reporter of This Paper

In recent years, the security situation on passenger trains has become a major concern for railway workers and the general public.

Various Types of Crimes

On March 1, 1988, in carriage 9 of the Chengguang 251 train, a cloth merchant from Guizhou's Zunyi boarded the train and placed a bag containing 150,000 yuan in the aisle. A thief pretending to sleep under a seat cut open the bag and stole 60,000 yuan.

Once discovered, thieves often reveal their ferocious nature. On March 23 this year, during the journey of the 381 train from Sichuan's Sanjiang to Gan Shuizhen, a group of 15 young men from a coal mine in Qijiang, Sichuan, were caught stealing in carriage 13 by passenger Yang Yuming. The group stabbed Yang, leaving him injured.

Some criminals even dare to openly rob passengers on trains. On March 5 this year, during the journey of the Nanhui 180 train from Hunan's Lijiaoping to Qidong, four passengers with Northeastern accents, each holding a fruit knife, saw clothes hanging on the coat hooks and began to search for money. When one passenger shouted for help, the robbers stabbed him, causing him to collapse. Two of his companions also tried to help but were injured, one with a head wound and the other with a facial injury.

Another form of robbery involves forced sales of goods, which also frightens passengers. On March 18 this year, during the journey of the Chengguang 251 train from Guizhou's Xifeng to Zunyi, a group of people on the train carried a bucket of milk and poured it into passengers' cups on the tea table, charging 10 yuan per cup. If passengers refused to pay, they were beaten. An elderly man with only 5 yuan was threatened with a knife, and the robbers even threatened to cut off his head.

Fights and injuries also frequently occur on trains. Passengers may argue over seats, luggage racks, or even minor collisions. On February 24, 1988, during the journey of the 561 train to Daguanshui Station, two brothers in carriage 4 argued over a seat with another passenger and were stabbed, resulting in serious injuries.

According to statistics from the Guiyang Railway Public Security Bureau, the bureau's train police squad handled 147 cases in 1988, including 65 major and serious cases, an increase of 40% and 110% respectively compared to 1987. This year, from January to March, 28 cases have been handled, including 10 major and serious cases.

Ferocious Criminals

The age of criminals on passenger trains generally ranges from 16 to 25. Some of them frequently operate on railways, committing crimes across provinces and regions. Some even "follow" the trains, and some have keys to the train doors, moving freely on the trains.

Criminals are very familiar with the train schedules and know the stations and stop times along the route. They often choose to act just before the train stops, quickly escaping after committing the crime. At around 9:40 PM on March 23, a train attendant reported that there was a fight on the train. The reporter and the train conductor rushed to the scene and found a young man with a broken head, covered in blood, flowing onto the floor and seats. It turned out that this young man had argued over a seat with three other young men. After sitting down, nothing was said at the time. When the train was about to reach Dushan Station in Guizhou, the three young men suddenly smashed a glass bottle on his head. As soon as the train stopped, they fled.

Facing such ferocious criminals, train staff often find themselves helpless, and incidents of being beaten or threatened are common. On March 12, during the journey of the Chengguang 251 train to Shuizhen Station in Sichuan, a passenger suddenly threatened to kill someone in carriage 12. When the train attendant tried to stop him, the passenger cut his thigh artery. Two train police who rushed to the scene were also injured, one with a cut on the face and the other with a stab wound in the stomach. According to statistics from the Nanning Railway Public Security Bureau, from 1988 to March this year, 64 passengers and train staff in the Nanning Passenger Section were threatened or beaten.

An Urgent Matter

The current security situation on passenger trains is increasingly severe. Investigations show that severe overcrowding is a major cause. Currently, passenger trains are generally overcrowded by about 80%, sometimes even by 200%, with people even squatting in the toilets. Overcrowding provides convenience for criminals. More worrying is that in severely overcrowded passenger trains, some passengers with sudden onset mental illnesses have appeared. According to the Guiyang Railway Public Security Bureau, they have discovered 5 cases of mentally ill patients attacking passengers with knives on trains this year, killing 27 passengers. Subsequent investigations showed that these 5 individuals and their families had no history of such illnesses, all being cases of sudden onset mental illness.

Additionally, with the development of the commodity economy, individual business owners, procurement agents, factory managers, and directors often travel with large amounts of cash, attracting criminals.

All the train police the reporter has seen have unanimously reflected that there are too few train police on passenger trains. Each train has 3 train police, 2 on duty and 1 on standby, with only 1 actually on duty, responsible for the safety of over 2,000 people, making it impossible to handle everything. On the train, train police do not even have a fixed place to handle issues. Train police are also worried about not having effective ways to deal with these criminals on the train.

In summary, the security problem on passenger trains must be addressed immediately. Failure to severely crack down on the small number of ferocious criminals on trains is irresponsible to the safety of the majority of passengers and damages the reputation of the people's railway.

Editor's Note

Some criminals openly steal and rob on passenger trains, becoming a prominent issue in railway security work. Although maintaining order on trains is a comprehensive issue, it mainly relies on the efforts of the railway department, especially the train police on the front line.

From today's report and letters, it can be seen that train service personnel and train police have made arduous efforts to protect the personal and property safety of passengers, with some even being harmed by criminals; but there are also some train police who are irresponsible and do not dare to stop criminals when they commit crimes. In fact, criminals are cowardly at heart. They dare to act recklessly precisely because they exploit people's fear. If train police encounter criminals committing crimes, they should take responsibility and dare to step forward. Passengers will be your strong support. Similarly, with the support of train police, the majority of passengers will consciously fight against criminals. With such mutual support, criminals will not dare to act rashly.

Recently, the railway department has decided to maintain order on trains. With the active assistance and cooperation of the majority of passengers, the security situation on trains will gradually improve.

### 车厢里的阴影

　　车厢里的阴影
    本报记者  朱思雄
    近几年来，旅客列车上的治安状况，成为铁路职工和广大旅客忧心忡忡的问题。
    　　　　作案种种
    １９８８年３月的一天，在成广２５１次列车９号车厢，从贵州遵义上来一位布匹商，将装有１５万元的皮包放在过道上。假装在座位底下睡觉的小偷，划开皮包偷走６万余元。
    偷盗者的行为一旦被发现，往往凶相毕露。今年３月２３日，３８１次列车行至四川三江至赶水区间，四川綦江某煤矿的１５个年轻人在１３号车行窃时，遭到旅客杨玉明的反抗，这伙人用刀将杨刺伤。
    有的犯罪分子竟敢明目张胆地在列车上抢劫。今年３月５日，南沪１８０次列车行至湖南黎家坪—祁东区间，４号车厢里有４个操东北口音的旅客各持水果刀，见到挂在衣帽钩上的衣服，拿过来就掏钱。一位旅客大声呼喊，抢劫者用刀一顿猛戳，那位旅客当即倒在地上；他的两个同伴见状，大声呼救，结果，一个被砍伤头顶，一个脸部被刺伤。
    还有一种形式的抢劫，即强卖物品，也让旅客胆颤心惊。今年３月１８日，成广２５１次列车行进在贵州息烽至遵义区间，车上有一伙人，拎着一桶牛奶，见到茶几上的旅客茶杯就往里倒，一杯１０元，不给钱便打人。有个老同志手头只有５元钱，这伙人拔出刀子要抢他的手表，还扬言要割掉他的头。
    列车上，斗殴伤人的事件也常发生。有的旅客为争座位、行李架或仅因行走碰撞也大动肝火。１９８８年２月２４日，５６１次列车到大关冲车站，４号车厢有兄弟俩与另一旅客争座位被对方用刀刺成重伤。
    据贵阳铁路公安分局统计，这个局乘警队１９８８年共立案１４７起，其中重特大案６５起，分别比１９８７年增长４０％和１１０％；今年１至３月已立案２８起，其中重特大案１０起。
    　　　　凶恶歹徒
    旅客列车上的作案者，年龄一般在１６到２５岁之间。他们中有的常年活动在铁路上，跨省跨区作案，有的甚至与列车“跟班”，有的还备有车门的钥匙，在列车上通行自如。
    作案者对列车的规律都摸得很清楚，对沿途各站以及停车开车时间了如指掌，作案时间往往选在停车前，一俟得手马上下车。３月２３日晚９点４０分左右，忽然列车员来报车上有人打架，记者和车长一起赶到现场，只见一个青年的头被打破，满脸是血，流到地上、座位上。原来这一青年曾和另３个青年争座位，坐定之后当时都没说什么，车快到贵州独山站时，那３个青年一起用玻璃朝这个青年猛砸，车一停，即逃之夭夭。
    面对凶残的作案歹徒，列车上的工作人员往往孤掌难鸣，因此遭殴打、受威胁的事屡见不鲜。３月１２日，成广２５１次行至四川赶水站，一旅客在１２号车厢突然扬言要杀人，列车员前去劝阻，结果大腿动脉血管被割断，闻讯赶来的两名乘警，一个脸上被划破，一个肚子上被刺一刀。据南宁铁路公安分处统计，１９８８年到今年３月，南宁客运段有旅客、列车工作人员６４人次受威胁和被殴打。
    　　　　迫在眉睫
    旅客列车治安现状日益严峻，原因何在？通过调查表明，列车超员严重是一个重要原因。现在的旅客列车超员一般都达８０％左右，有时甚至达２００％，有时连厕所里也要蹲上几个人。列车拥挤，为作案者提供了便利。更让人忧虑的是，在严重超员的旅客列车里，出现了一些突发性精神病患者。据贵阳铁路公安分局介绍，今年他们已发现５起精神病患者在列车上持刀杀人，杀死旅客２７人，而事后调查表明，这５个人及其亲属中都没有过这样的病史，均属突发性精神病。
    另外，随着商品经济的发展，列车上常有携带巨额现金的个体户、采购员、厂长、经理等南来北往，这对犯罪分子产生了巨大的吸引力。
    记者见过的所有乘警都异口同声地反映：旅客列车上乘警太少。每趟车３个乘警，２个倒班，１个机动，实际只有１人值勤，却要负责２０００多人的安全，实在忙不过来。在列车上，乘警连一个处理问题的固定地方都没有。乘警们还为没有有效地处理列车上这些案犯的办法而大伤脑筋。
    总之，旅客列车上的治安问题已到非马上解决不可的地步，不严厉打击在列车上胡作非为的少数凶残歹徒，就是对广大旅客的生命和财产不负责任，有损人民铁路的声誉。　
　　编后
    一些歹徒在旅客列车上肆意行窃抢劫，成为铁路治安工作中一个突出问题。虽然治理列车秩序是综合性的问题，但主要是靠铁路部门的努力，特别是站在第一线的列车乘警。
    从今天刊登的报道和来信中可以看出，列车服务人员和乘警为保护旅客人身财产安全付出了艰苦的努力，有些甚至遇到歹徒的伤害；但也有一些列车乘警不负责任，遇到歹徒作案不敢出面制止。其实，歹徒的内心是胆怯的，他们之所以猖獗，正是抓住了人们的畏惧心理。如果乘警遇到犯罪分子作案，勇于负责，敢于挺身而出，旅客会做你们的坚强后盾。同样，有乘警的支持，广大旅客会自觉地和犯罪分子作斗争。有这种相互支持，犯罪分子决不敢轻举妄动。
    最近，铁路部门已下决心治理列车秩序，有广大旅客大力协助和配合，列车治安状况定会逐步好转。
