It was a case of turning misfortune into good luck, and it was sheer coincidence that allowed a reporter to pick up a piece of news on the way to Xishui.

On May 11, a delegation from the National Evening Newspaper Association, organized to visit the area, left Zunyi at noon after having lunch in Renhuai County. Without resting, they headed straight for Xishui County. The reporter and "Chen Boss" from the Harbin Evening News shared a car, but unfortunately, the car broke down at the border between Renhuai and Xishui.

The driver worked on fixing the car, while the reporter and "Chen Boss" waited under a small tree by the roadside. The May sun beat down on the rolling hills, casting a grayish hue over everything. A few houses were visible by the roadside, appearing to be perched on the rocky slopes. The hardships of life in the mountains were evident, and it was a sight to behold. As we sat there, bored and parched, two elderly men walked down the mountain path. One wore a military uniform jacket with blue trousers and a white cloth wrapped around his head, carrying a child about a year old on his back. The child had a purple complexion and a rugged demeanor. The other man wore a long black robe, holding a three-foot-long pipe in his left hand, with a white cloth wrapped around his head as well. His face showed signs of recent illness. The two elderly men, seeing that we were from out of town, approached us and struck up a conversation. I asked one of them, "Why do both of you have white cloth wrapped around your heads? Are you from an ethnic minority?"

The old man replied, "No, we are Han Chinese. Wrapping the head with white cloth is an old custom here." The other old man added, "Last year, I went to Beijing with my head wrapped in white cloth."

Hearing that one of them had been to Beijing, I eagerly asked what he had gone there for. He said it wasn't for visiting relatives, seeking medical treatment, or tourism, but for attending a conference. It turned out that last year, the Ministry of Justice held a conference on mediation work, and this old man was a representative from Guizhou Province. The two old men insisted that we walk a few steps down the slope to sit in their house, saying that it belonged to one of their adopted sons.

This was a typical mountain farmer's residence, with a few large rooms that were blackened by smoke, lacking modern furnishings but quite cool inside. The courtyard had sun-dried rice from the previous year, a dog lying in the shade, and chickens pecking around. There was no modern comfort, but there was plenty of food and clothing, and the warmth of family life. When the female host brought out the tea, she repeatedly explained that it was new tea from this year and that the cups had been washed two or three times. Whether it was due to the heat or the long journey, when I drank the strong tea, a refreshing sensation surged through me. The tea was homemade, a true "roasted green tea." Although some of the leaves had burnt edges, the pure and rich aroma was something that machine-made tea couldn't match. This made one think of "red rice and pumpkin soup," which might not compare to delicacies, but the joy and harmony of rural life were something that those accustomed to fine dining could not experience.

The old man carrying the child put him down and said, "This is my youngest grandson. I have three sons; two farm, and one is in the army elsewhere. I am the head of the mediation committee in Jutuoba Village, Daba Township, Renhuai County. I am 61 years old and named Qiu Guanglin." Besides tending to his personal farm and entertaining his grandson, he devoted most of his energy to mediation work. Just then, the driver ran over and said that there were no spare screws on the car. Comrade Qiu called the owner of the house to find some, and we continued our conversation.

Comrade Qiu has been doing mediation work for decades. The local mountain people call him "Qiu Qingtian." When his exemplary deeds were introduced at the conference in Beijing last year, it was mentioned that he mediated disputes covering two provinces, three counties, eight districts, fifteen townships, and thirty-five villages, an area of several dozen miles. This year, the coverage has expanded to nine districts, eighteen townships, and thirty-eight villages. I asked why it was "two provinces and three counties." He explained, "This place is not only at the border of three counties but also at the border of two provinces. The other side of the mountain is Sichuan." He said he had mediated over a thousand disputes. Today, he came here after mediating two disputes in the morning and then invited this old friend to meet.

When we turned our attention to the other old man, he was leisurely playing with his three-foot-long bamboo pipe, which was black and red, as if it had been soaked in oil. Comrade Qiu introduced, "You can't tell, can you? This man was once a soldier. He joined the army in 1951, participated in the Battle of Triangle Hill, and was in the 38th Army. He returned to the country after the ceasefire in 1953." Indeed, one couldn't tell! The man who was once handling a rifle is now handling a pipe! Life's journey is indeed vast! We asked for his name, and he said he was Zhao Xiusheng, from Longsheng Township, Longhui Village nearby, and was 65 years old. I asked when he was discharged, and he said 1956. "At that time, it was easy for demobilized soldiers to find jobs, so why didn't you go out?" I asked, puzzled. He smiled faintly and said, "At that time, it was the height of the cooperative movement, and Chairman Mao called on demobilized soldiers to support agriculture, so I came back." He spoke very casually, without a hint of regret. I asked about his health, and he stretched out his leg for us to see. His leg was also swollen, and he said this was a condition he got from climbing icy mountains and lying in the snow during the war. I asked if the local government took care of him, and he said it didn't in the past, but in recent years, when he couldn't work anymore, the government gave him a monthly living allowance of 15 yuan. At this point, the old man became excited, his eyes moistening, and he said, "The Party and the people have not forgotten us old soldiers!" He repeatedly expressed his gratitude to the Party! Fifteen yuan, which might not even be enough for a meal at "KFC" for a young city dweller, was considered so precious by the country's heroes!

We then asked Comrade Qiu about the scope of his mediation work. Comrade Qiu smiled and said, "All kinds of things, marital disputes, parent-child fights, neighborhood quarrels, land and property disputes, pigs from Zhang's family damaging Li's field, Li's dog biting Zhang's pig, the mother-in-law saying the daughter-in-law is disrespectful, the younger sister-in-law saying the elder sister-in-law is too harsh... As long as it's not a criminal case, he handles everything. He said that the court often invites him to participate in trials, and some cases that need mediation are directly handed over to him. I asked what he relies on for mediation work, and he said, "First, 'heart,' and second, 'endurance.' By 'heart,' I mean careful, patient, kind, fair, and good-hearted, with no ill intentions towards anyone; by 'endurance,' I mean being able to walk, endure hardship, hunger, cold, rain, and bear everything, listen to everything, and swallow everything. He also said that mediation work must comply with the Party's policies, so he pays great attention to learning. I asked where he does his mediation work, and he said sometimes he has to cross mountains and valleys for dozens of miles, and sometimes people come to his door, and he does it at home. He has a special reception room at home. I asked if his wife supports him, and he said, "Women are always nagging, but mountain people are kind-hearted, and she often says I'm doing 'good deeds.' I asked if he charges for mediation, and he said, 'No, it's voluntary mediation.' I joked with him, saying he could be a 'mediation specialist' and make some 'mediation money.' He said, 'People in the mountains don't value money much, as long as they have peace, food, and clothing, isn't that good enough!'"

As we spoke, the female host brought out half a bowl of rice with some sauce on top, asking Comrade Qiu to feed his grandson. Comrade Qiu fed the child while continuing to chat with us about strange disputes. Rice grains fell to the ground and were quickly snatched up by chickens, and the yellow dog wagged its tail nearby...

The car was fixed, and the two old men sent us back to the road. Their family saw us off to the car. Everyone was reluctant to part, not like we had disturbed them, but rather, it seemed like we had brought them something.

The car sped along the road, and our hearts rolled like the wheels. Both the reporter and "Chen Boss" almost simultaneously said, "The people in the old revolutionary base areas are truly good!"

　　拾来的新闻
    本报记者  吴昊
    说来是因祸得福、机缘凑巧，记者竟在去习水的路上拾得一条新闻。
    ５月１１日，全国晚报协会组织的采访团从遵义出发，中午在仁怀县吃过午饭以后，没有休息，即直奔习水县。记者同哈尔滨新晚报的“陈总”同乘一车，不料，汽车开到仁怀与习水交界处出了毛病。
    司机修车，我和“陈总”到路边的一棵小树下等候。五月的骄阳，晒到峰峦起伏的万山丛中，到处都是灰蒙蒙的色彩。路边有几户人家，从远看去，好像都是吊在半山坡的岩石上。山区人民生活之艰难，令人感叹！正在我们百无聊赖又口干舌燥的时候，山路上走来了两位老人。一个上身穿军便服，下穿蓝布裤子，头上包着白布，背后背着个一周多一点的小孩，紫色脸膛，眉宇间显出一股豪爽之气；另一个身着黑色长衫，左手提着一根三尺长的烟袋，头上同样包着白布，面目却略带浮肿，似是久病刚愈的样子。两位老人见我们是从外地来的，即走上来和我们搭话。我问其中的一位：“你们的头上都缠着白布，是不是少数民族？”老人说：“不是。我们是汉人。白布包头是这里人的老习惯了。”另一位老人说：“去年我到北京，头上也是包着白布的。”听说老人去过北京，我忙问他去干什么？他说不是走亲戚、看病，也不是去旅游，而是去开会。原来去年司法部召开民间调解工作会议，这位老人是作为贵州省的代表出席的。两位老人一定要我们再走几步到坡下的房子里坐一坐，其中一位说那是他的义子家。
    这是一座典型的山区农民的住宅，几间高大的房屋，虽已熏得乌黑，屋内也没有现代化的陈设，但却十分凉爽。院子里晒着陈年的稻谷，狗卧在树荫下，鸡群忙着到处啄食。这里没有现代化的享受，但却不乏丰衣足食与天伦之乐。当女主人把茶水端上来时，她一再解释，这是今年的新茶，并说茶杯是洗过两三遍的。不知是因为天气太热了，还是我们乘车的时间太长了，当我把这浓浓的茶水咽下去的时候，一股清爽之气油然而升。茶是主人自制的，可谓真正的“烤青”。尽管飘上来的叶子有烤糊的痕迹，但那淳正而浓郁的香味，却是机制茶所没有的。这使人想到“红米饭，南瓜汤”，虽比不上山珍海味，但其乐融融的农家情韵，却是吃惯山珍海味的人享受不到的。
    背着小孩的那位老人，把孩子放下说，这是他最小的孙子，他有三个儿子，两个种田，一个在外地当兵，他是仁怀县大坝乡朱土坝村村民调解委员会的负责人，今年６１岁，叫仇光琳。每天除了种种自留田、哄哄小孙孙之外，主要精力都用于民事调解工作。正在这时，司机跑来说，车上没有备用螺丝，仇老汉便叫这家的主人去找，我们则继续聊天。
    仇老汉做调解工作，已有几十年，这里的山民们称他为“仇青天”。去年到北京开会时，介绍他的先进事迹时说，他调解的范围是两省、３县、８个区、１５个乡、３５个村，方圆几十里，今年则增加到了９个区、１８个乡、３８个村。我问他为什么是“两省三县”？他说，“这里不仅是三县交界处，也是两省交界处，山的那面就是四川。”他说经他调解的纠纷已有千件之多。今天到这里来，是早晨调解了两场纠纷之后，才约这位老亲家来这里相聚的。
    当我们把目光投向那位老人时，那位老人正在悠闲地摆弄着那３尺长的竹子烟管，烟管黑红黑红的，像是在油缸里泡过。仇老汉介绍说，你们看不出吧，这位当年可是当过兵的，１９５１年入朝，参加过上甘岭战役，是３８军的，１９５３年停战以后回国。真的看不出！这位摆弄烟管的老人当年竟是摆弄枪杆子的！真的想不到！人生的跨度竟有多么大啊！我们问他尊姓大名，他说他叫赵秀生，是附近隆胜乡龙回村的，今年６５岁了。我问他什么时候转业，他说１９５６年。“那个时候转业军人挺好找工作的，怎么没有出去？”我不解地问。他淡淡地一笑说，那时正是合作化高潮，毛主席号召转业军人支援农业，我就回来了。他说得十分平淡，绝没有半点后悔。我问他身体如何，他把腿伸过来让我们看，腿也是浮肿的，他说这还是原来打仗的时候爬冰卧雪种下的毛病。我问地方政府对他可有照顾？他说过去没有，这几年不能劳动了，政府每月给１５元生活补贴。谈到这里，老人一下子激动起来，眼睛也湿润了，他说：“党和人民并没有忘记我们这些老兵啊！”并一再表示他感谢党！１５元钱，这在城里青年可能还不够一次“肯德基”，而共和国的功臣却把它看得如此之重！如此之重！
    接着，我们又问仇老汉的调解工作都包括哪些方面？仇老汉笑了笑说，什么都有，夫妻不和，父子打架，邻里纠纷，房基地、土地纠纷，张家的猪害了李家的田，李家的狗咬了张家的猪，婆婆说儿媳妇不孝顺，小姑子说嫂子太厉害……只要不是刑事案件，他什么都管。他说法院审案子也常请他去参加，有些需要调解的干脆交给他去调解。我问他做调解工作靠什么，他说一靠“心”，二靠“得”。所谓“心”，就是细心、耐心、热心、平心、良心，对谁都没有坏心；所谓“得”，就是要走得、苦得、饿得、冻得、淋得、受得，总之什么苦都得吃，什么罪都得受，什么话都得听，什么气都得咽。他还说，做调解工作，处处要符合党的政策，因而他十分注意学习。我问他调解工作都在哪里做，他说有时翻山越岭要跑几十里路，有时人家找上门来，就在自家做。他家里专门设了接待室。我问他老伴是否支持他？他说，女人嘛，总是唠唠叨叨的，不过山里人心眼好，她也常说我干的是“积德积善”的事情。我问他调解是否收费？他说：不，一分钱不要，是义务调解。我和他开玩笑说，你可以当个“调解专业户”，发个“调解财”。他说，山里对那个（指钱）看得并不重，安安定定，有吃有喝，不是很好吗！
    说话间，女主人端来半碗饭，上面浇了一点菜汤，叫仇老汉喂他的孙子。仇老汉一边喂小孩，一边继续和我们聊那些奇怪的民间纠纷。饭粒子掉在地上，马上被鸡抢走，黄狗在一旁摇着尾巴……
    车子修好了，二位老汉把我们送上公路，他们一家人送我们上车。大家依依不舍，不像是我们打扰了他们，倒像是我们给他们带来了什么。
    汽车在公路上奔驰，我们的心像车轮一样地翻滚，我和“陈总”几乎同声说出：“老区的人真好啊！”
