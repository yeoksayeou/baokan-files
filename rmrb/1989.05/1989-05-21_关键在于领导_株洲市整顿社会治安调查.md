The key lies in leadership – an investigation into the rectification of social order in Zhuzhou City

Zhuzhou City is located at the intersection of the Beijing-Guangzhou, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Hunan-Guizhou railways, serving as a major railway hub in southern China. Over the past year, the municipal Party committee and government have organized various forces to implement comprehensive management, combining concentrated strikes and rectification, achieving significant results. Since December last year, the number of criminal cases in the entire city has been decreasing month by month.

The main approaches taken by Zhuzhou City are as follows:

(1) Focusing on hotspots in public security, conducting concentrated strikes and rectification.

Theft and pickpocketing cases have increased (accounting for 91% of the total number of criminal cases), with a notable rise in itinerant crimes (accounting for 11%), and the popularity of billiard gambling in urban and rural areas. Traffic disorder in the city area is another prominent public security issue. The municipal Party committee and government have made resolving these issues a key focus in rectifying social order, organizing "unified actions" and carrying out specialized campaigns at appropriate times.

Over the past year, the city has organized six major concentrated strike actions during the Spring Festival, May Day, National Day, and mid-December. The "strike against itinerant criminals and pursue fugitives" unified action launched in January this year inspected 4,700 potential hiding places for itinerant criminals, apprehended over 2,100 lawbreakers, including 22 fugitives, solved 679 cases, and seized over 100,000 yuan in stolen money and goods. In August and September last year, a series of specialized campaigns were launched with a focus on combating theft, robbery, hooliganism, and disorder, solving over 1,400 cases, dismantling 70 gangs, and legally punishing over 3,600 criminals. In November last year, another specialized campaign was launched to combat theft, robbery, hooliganism, and gambling, solving over 4,900 cases and dismantling 137 gangs, laying the foundation for public security during the New Year and Spring Festival this year.

While conducting concentrated strikes, the entire city has carried out rectification work with the main content of "treating the root causes and eliminating sources of trouble." In response to the prominence of itinerant crimes, the entire city has conducted a comprehensive cleanup and rectification of temporary residents, registering over 40,000 temporary residents; implemented public security contracts for shop tenants, with 208 units signing public security contracts with construction workers in their units, and sending back 448 wandering individuals; strengthened the prevention work of important venues and key positions, forming 131 patrol teams for day and night patrols. In response to the prevalence of billiard gambling, the municipal government organized the cultural, commercial, and public security departments, among others, to conduct a comprehensive cleanup and rectification of the commercial billiard industry, effectively curbing the once-popular "billiard gambling."

(2) Leveraging large factories, radiating outwards, and implementing comprehensive management in small areas.

The Party and government leaders of Zhuzhou City have invested a great deal of effort in building a grassroots public security prevention system. First, they reformed the duty system of police stations, established police districts, implemented the system of police captains being responsible under the leadership of the police station chief, and implemented divided responsibilities for different areas. Currently, the city has established 53 police districts. Second, they strengthened the public security joint defense teams. Last year, the entire city established 684 professional and voluntary joint defense teams, with over 8,500 team members, apprehending over 8,500 lawbreakers and assisting in solving 4,049 cases. Third, they leveraged large factories to implement comprehensive management in small areas. For example, the Dianxin area in the eastern district of the city has 61 large and small units and 14 neighborhood committees, with 75% of the population being employees and family members of the Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Factory. Originally, due to different affiliations, public security joint defense could not form a united front. Over the past year, coordinated by the city district, the Electric Locomotive Factory allocated 47,600 yuan in special funds, selected over 30 retired employees to strengthen the area's public security joint defense team, and dispatched a mid-level cadre to the street office to serve as the deputy director, taking the lead in public security work in the area.

Establishing a public security joint defense association to turn "solo performances" into "choral singing." The Hejia Tu area in the northern district has 212 large and small units, with thousands of public security personnel. Originally, public security work was fragmented and each unit operated independently, feeling overwhelmed. In May last year, the district established the first public security joint defense association in the city, led by the local government and participated by the main responsible persons of large enterprises and institutions. The association unified the public security forces of member units under its leadership, quickly forming a powerful force.

　　关键在于领导
    ——株洲市整顿社会治安调查
    株洲市地处京广、浙赣、湘黔三条铁路干线交汇点，系南方铁路交通枢纽。去年以来，市委、市政府组织各方面力量，实行综合治理与集中打击、集中整顿相结合，取得了明显成效。从去年１２月起，全市刑事案件逐月下降。
    株洲市的主要作法是：
    （一）抓住治安“热点”，集中打击，集中整顿。
    偷盗、扒窃案件上升（占刑事案件总数的９１％），流窜犯罪突出（占１１％），“台球赌博”风靡城乡，市区交通秩序混乱，是该市前段最为突出的治安问题。市委、市政府把解决上述问题作为整顿社会治安的重点，适时组织“统一行动”，开展专项斗争。
    去年以来，全市分别在春节、“五一”、“国庆”和１２月中下旬，组织６次大的集中打击行动。今年元月开展的“打流窜，追逃犯”统一行动，清查流窜犯可能藏身地４７００多处，抓获违法犯罪人员２１００多名，其中逃犯２２名，破获案件６７９起，收缴赃款赃物１０万余元。去年８、９月，以打击盗窃、哄抢、流氓滋扰为重点，开展系列专项斗争，破获案件１４００多起，摧毁团伙７０个，依法打击处理犯罪分子３６００多名；去年１１月，再次开展“反盗扒、打抢劫、惩流氓、查赌博”专项斗争，破案４９００多起，摧毁团伙１３７个，为今年元旦、春节的治安打下了基础。
    在开展集中打击的同时，全市开展以“治乱源，除祸根”为主要内容的整顿工作。针对流窜犯罪突出，全市全面清理整顿暂住人口，清理登记暂住人口４万多名；对店铺出租户实行治安承包，有２０８个单位与在该单位施工的民工签订治安合同，收容遣送外流人员４４８名；加强重要场所、重点部位防范工作，组成１３１个巡逻小组，昼夜巡逻守护。针对“台球赌博”成风，市政府组织文化、工商、公安等６个部门，对营业性台球行业进行全面清理整顿，刹住了风靡一时的“台球赌博”。
    （二）依托大厂，辐射四周，实行小区域综合治理。
    株洲市党政领导倾注很大精力抓基层治安防范体系建设。一是对派出所勤务制度进行改革，建立警务区，推行所长领导下的警长负责制，实行分片划块，包干负责。目前，市区已建立警务区５３个。二是加强治安联防队。去年，全市共组建专业、义务联防队６８４个，联防队员达８５００多人，共抓获各类违法犯罪分子８５００多名，协助破案４０４９起。三是依托大厂，实行小区域综合治理。如市东区田心地区有大小单位６１个，居委会１４个，７５％的人员是株洲电力机车工厂的职工和家属。原来由于隶属关系不一，治安联防形不成合力。去年以来，由市区协调，电力机车厂拨出４．７６万元专款，选聘３０多名退休职工加强地区治安联防队，派出一名中层干部到街道办事处兼任副主任，牵头抓该区治安保卫工作。
    成立治安联防协会，变“独角戏”为“大合唱”。北区贺家土地区有大小单位２１２个，治安保卫人员不下千人。原来治安工作处于条块分割、各自为政状态，都感到力不从心。去年５月，该区组建全市第一个由当地政府牵头、有大企事业单位主要负责人参加的治安联防协会，将会员单位的治保力量统一在协会领导下工作，很快形成了一股强大力量。  　　　　（湖株）
