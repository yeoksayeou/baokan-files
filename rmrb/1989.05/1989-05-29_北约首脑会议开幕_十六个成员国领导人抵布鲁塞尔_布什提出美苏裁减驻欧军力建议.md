**NATO Summit Opens; 16 Member States' Leaders Arrive in Brussels; Bush Proposes U.S.-Soviet Troop Reduction in Europe**

Today at 9 AM, including Bush, Thatcher, and Kohl, 16 leaders of NATO member states arrived at the NATO headquarters. The two-day NATO summit officially opened this morning.

In his opening remarks, NATO Secretary-General Werner stated, "We are in a period that presents both great opportunities and significant dangers. At every historical turning point, these two factors are intertwined, requiring equal flexibility in response." He asserted, "The post-war world as we know it is coming to an end."

To hasten the arrival of this "new world," Werner advocated for NATO to maintain a strong defense and a credible deterrent. For this, he believed that the combination of conventional and nuclear forces is "indivisible," as nuclear weapons are the "ultimate guarantee" against war.

In the final part of his opening remarks, Werner said, "The key to properly handling East-West relations is to properly handle West-West relations. Only by standing united can we influence the development of events."

At this historical turning point, disagreements have emerged, leading to crises. Efforts are being made through high-level consultations to break through these crises, adjust relations, and strategies, which is the current state of NATO and the challenge facing this summit.

According to a report by the American Columbia Broadcasting System, at the NATO summit that opened today, Bush formally proposed reducing U.S. and Soviet troops in Eastern and Western Europe to expedite the achievement of a conventional arms control agreement between East and West.

According to the May 29th issue of *The New York Times*, the main points of Bush's arms reduction proposal are: reducing the number of U.S. land and air forces in Europe by 30,000, which is approximately 10% of the current U.S. troops in Europe. Currently, there are 305,000 U.S. troops stationed in Europe. According to Bush's proposal, the troop limit for both the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Eastern and Western Europe would be reduced to 275,000. At the same time, Bush proposed that NATO agree to reduce various types of military aircraft on both sides, bringing the number of aircraft to 15% less than the current Western level. Bush also proposed that East and West reach a conventional arms control agreement within half a year to a year and implement it starting in 1992 or 1993.

It is believed that this is the first time NATO has agreed to reduce the number of troops and aircraft in European conventional arms control.

　　北约首脑会议开幕
    十六个成员国领导人抵布鲁塞尔
    布什提出美苏裁减驻欧军力建议
    本报布鲁塞尔５月２９日电  记者魏崴报道：今天上午９时以后，包括布什、撒切尔夫人和科尔在内的１６个北约成员国的国家元首或政府领导人陆续抵达北约总部，为期两天的北约首脑会议今天上午正式开幕。
    北约秘书长韦尔纳在开幕词中指出，“我们正处在一个既呈现出伟大的机会、又潜伏着巨大危险的时期。在一切历史转折关头，这两种因素都是交织在一起的，需要以同等的灵活对待之”。他断言，“我们熟悉的战后世界，行将结束。”
    为了这个“新世界”早日到来，韦尔纳主张北约必需维持一个强大的防务，一个值得信任的威慑手段。为此，他认为常规力量与核力量的结合具有“不可分割的”性质，因为核武器是防止战争的“最后保证”。
    在开幕词的最后部分，韦尔纳说，“妥善处理东西方关系的关键，是妥善处理西西方关系。只有团结一致，我们才能左右事态的发展。”
    在历史转折关头出现分歧，分歧导致危机，又企图通过高级磋商冲破危机，调整关系和战略，是北约的现状，也是此次首脑会议的难题。
    本报华盛顿５月２９日电　据美国哥伦比亚广播公司报道，在今天开幕的北约首脑会议上，布什正式提出美苏裁减各自驻东、西欧陆空军力量的建议，以争取早日达成一项东西方之间的常规裁军协议。
    据５月２９日《纽约时报》报道，布什提出裁军建议的主要内容是，把美国驻欧洲的陆空军人数裁减３万人，即裁减现有美国驻欧军队的１０％左右。目前美国有３０５０００名驻军，根据布什的建议，美国和苏联各方在东、西欧的驻军限额将减少到２７５０００人。同时布什建议，北约同意裁减东西方的各类军用飞机，把飞机的数量减少到比西方现有数量少１５％的水平。布什还建议，东西方在半年至一年的时间内达成一项常规裁军协议，并从１９９２或１９９３年开始生效。
    据认为，这是北约第一次同意在欧洲常规裁军中削减军队和飞机数量。
