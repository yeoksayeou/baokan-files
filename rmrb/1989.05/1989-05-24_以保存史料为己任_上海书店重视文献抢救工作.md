Shanghai Bookstore takes on the task of preserving historical materials and prioritizes the rescue of documents. The New China News Agency reports from Beijing on May 22 that Shanghai Bookstore, with the mission of preserving historical materials and rescuing documents, is gradually compiling and reprinting a batch of precious materials, including the "Collection of Republican Period Books."

During China's Republican period, there was a significant exchange between Eastern and Western cultures, and a fierce clash between new and old ideologies, resulting in many important academic works. However, books from this period are widely scattered, and some have become rare, posing great difficulties for current academic research.

Shanghai Bookstore and Fudan University have decided to fill this gap in Chinese culture. In the past two years, they have conducted a comprehensive survey of 100,000 books published during the Republican period and proposed the idea of compiling the "Collection of Republican Period Books": selecting and collecting 3,000 important books from various categories, divided into 10 volumes, with 100 books in each volume, to be completed in five years.

The first volume of books, which will be officially released to readers around the time of the National Day this year, includes 257 types, divided into categories such as philosophy and religion, general social sciences, politics, law, and military, economics, culture, education, and sports. Among them, many are the most representative and authoritative works in their respective fields at that time, and some books have not been reprinted for over 40 years.

Local chronicles are a type of book unique to ancient times that records the history of a place. China has a 2,000-year history of compiling local chronicles, with over 8,700 surviving local chronicles. However, they are often limited by region and scattered. Shanghai Bookstore is collaborating with Jiangsu Ancient Books Publishing House and Ba Shu Publishing House to publish the "Collection of Chinese Local Chronicles." It is reported that this is currently the most complete large-scale collection of local chronicles, including provincial chronicles, prefectural chronicles, county chronicles, township chronicles, as well as mountain and water chronicles, temple chronicles, and more, totaling over 3,000 types.

Shanghai Bookstore published "Selected Compilation of Ming Dynasty Local Chronicles from Tianyi Pavilion" in the 1960s, which was well-received by the academic community. Currently, they are expediting the publication of its "Supplement." The Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo was built over 400 years ago and is the oldest surviving library in China. The upcoming "Supplement" will select 109 Ming Dynasty local chronicles from the Tianyi Pavilion. According to records, 84 of these are the only surviving copies in the world.

　　以保存史料为己任
    上海书店重视文献抢救工作
    新华社北京５月２２日电  （记者李光茹）上海书店以保存史料、抢救文献为己任，正陆续辑集影印《民国丛书》等一批珍贵资料。
    中国历史上的民国时期，中西文化相互交流，新旧思想剧烈冲突，产生了许多重要的学术论著。然而，这一时期的图书流散严重，有些已成海内孤本，给当今的学术研究带来很大困难。
    上海书店和复旦大学决心弥合中国文化上的这一“断层”，前两年全面清查了民国时期出版的１０万种图书，提出辑印《民国丛书》的构想：不受政治观点影响，择要选收各类图书３０００种，分为１０编，每编１００册，５年内出齐。
    今年“十一”之际正式同读者见面的第一编图书有２５７种，分为哲学、宗教类，社会科学总论类，政治、法律、军事类，经济类，文化、教育、体育类等，其中不少是当时各学科中最具代表性和权威性的著作，有些书４０多年来从未重印过。
    地方志是古代特有的记述地方历史一类书籍，中国已有２０００年修志的历史，流传至今的地方志有８７００多种，但多受地域局限，较为零散。上海书店正会同江苏古籍出版社、巴蜀书社联合出版《中国地方志集成》。据介绍，这是目前选收方志最完整的大型丛书，包括省志、府志、州志、县志、乡镇志以及山水志、寺庙志等３０００余种。
    上海书店曾于６０年代出版过《天一阁藏明代方志选刊》，很受学术界欢迎，目前正在加紧出版其“续编”。宁波天一阁建于４００多年前，是国内现存历史最久的藏书楼。即将问世的“续编”，选收天一阁藏明代方志１０９种。据查，其中８４种为传世仅存的孤本。
