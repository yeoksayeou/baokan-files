A certain degree of economic growth is always accompanied by a certain degree of inflation, which is a global economic phenomenon. If "stagflation" occurs, we should strive to turn it into an opportunity for more effective economic development. The successful method to control inflation is to focus on structural adjustment and raising interest rates.

Shen Guangzu has been deeply engaged in the study of the world economy for many years. Recently, he shared his views on controlling inflation with our reporter.

Reporter (hereinafter referred to as Rep.): Currently, China is experiencing noticeable inflation. A few years ago, some people believed that "inflation is harmless" and is a "lubricant for economic growth." Now, there are many criticisms of this view.

Shen Guangzu (hereinafter referred to as Shen): When discussing inflation, we must distinguish between mild and severe inflation. The noticeable inflation that has occurred in China over the past two years has exceeded the tolerance of the state, enterprises, and individuals, and must be given sufficient attention.

Rep.: Can we understand from your remarks that there is a "degree" issue here, and that different levels of inflation have different impacts on the economy?

Shen: This question involves the relationship between inflation and economic growth, which is very complex and requires specific analysis. First, let's not discuss whether inflation is beneficial to economic development. We should recognize that a contemporary global economic phenomenon that cannot be ignored is that a certain degree of economic growth is always accompanied by a certain degree of inflation, which is not subject to human will.

For example, between 1950 and 1970, the average annual growth rate of GDP in developed countries was between 4% and 5%, with Japan reaching over 10%. In 1973, compared to 1950, Japan's GDP increased by 28.1 times, France by 11.7 times, Italy and West Germany both by over 9 times, the UK by 6.2 times, and the US by 4.5 times. Some developing countries and regions are similar. According to the World Bank's estimates, the GDP growth rates of South Korea, India, and Singapore in 1988 reached 8%.

At the same time, the inflation rates of various countries have been rising. From 1950 to 1970, the average annual inflation rate in developed countries was 6.7%, while in developing countries it was 13.8%. After 1970, the inflation rate increased significantly, with the highest in developed countries reaching over 15%, and the average in developing countries reaching 37.7%. Inflation manifests as a monetary phenomenon, and in general, when the money supply exceeds the supply of material goods in society, it occurs, leading to price increases and currency depreciation. This has been a common phenomenon in the 20th century. Taking the US as an example, $25,000 in 1932 is equivalent to $200,000 in 1988.

From the above, we can see that inflation exists simultaneously with economic development. At least this is the case in Western market economies. Because of loose monetary policy, abundant production funds, enterprises can gain more profits from inflation; at the same time, inflation can also stimulate social purchasing power, thereby stimulating the development of production. China is gradually developing a market economy, and this mechanism will also have a certain effect. From this point of view, when inflation occurs, it must be closely monitored, but there is no need to panic or prescribe drastic measures.

Rep.: Different schools of thought in Western economics have different views on inflation. One is the Keynesian school, which believes that inflation can stimulate consumption, aid in the development of production, and expand employment. After the 1970s, the monetarist school emerged, which believes that inflation will lead to large-scale speculation, reduce productive investment, and cause economic instability.

Shen: The opposition between these two schools is not as great as people say, but rather a difference in emphasis. The Keynesian school did not advocate unlimited currency issuance but rather, in the specific economic environment at the time, paid insufficient attention to stabilizing the currency; similarly, the monetarist school did not generally oppose inflation. They also believe that inflation will have an impact on economic development, and the key is to be moderate. This degree is generally recognized as 3% to 5%, and at most should not exceed 10%.

Rep.: The inflation that has occurred in China over the past two years has obviously far exceeded this degree. The National Bureau of Statistics published a price increase index of 18.3% for 1988, with the consumer price index in November 1988 being 30.3% higher than in November 1987, and the urban increase being even greater. Therefore, the government has taken strict measures to control inflation and rectify the economic order. However, it seems that some new problems have emerged. Some people are worried about the possibility of "stagflation."

Shen: "Stagflation" is the opposite of the situation where production overcapacity leads to production stagnation and price drops. One explanation is that it is mainly due to the government's previous adoption of expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, causing inflation to rise sharply; and then adopting contractionary fiscal and monetary policies, leading to production stagnation. When the effects of these two policies overlap, "stagflation" occurs. Now many people are worried about the possibility of "stagflation," and I think there is some reason to it, because the economic effects of the money issued in China over the past few years have just begun to unfold, while the recent half-year of tightening has already taken effect. In fact, the shadow of "stagflation" has already fallen upon us, mainly manifested in the fact that the current inflation has not been effectively controlled, while some important production sectors have begun to show signs of stagnation due to insufficient funds. According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the overall price level in the first quarter of this year remains high.

Rep.: This is a very tricky problem. The inflation in China is largely due to the irrational industrial structure leading to insufficient effective supply. The current rectification and adjustment, if not handled properly, may not only fail to control inflation but may also further worsen the effective supply.

Shen: Therefore, I believe that when we take countermeasures, we must be very cautious and have a full understanding of the complexity of the rectification. First, we must establish the recognition that if signs of "stagflation" appear, we should not simply regard it as a "bad thing" but should realistically and confidently regard solving "stagflation" as another opportunity for economic development. In the West, their process of solving "stagflation" is also a process of summarizing past experiences and lessons, and developing the economy more effectively. Therefore, just as with the attitude towards inflation, we should not be afraid of the occurrence of "stagflation," and especially should not panic.

Rep.: What should we pay attention to when solving "stagflation"?

Shen: When solving "stagflation," we should still firmly control inflation, and cannot simply reopen the monetary tap, especially when many of the current information may not be accurate. However, the methods of controlling inflation are different. The experience of other countries in the world proves that using price freezing to control inflation is generally ineffective. Successful methods are to focus on raising interest rates and adjusting the structure, which can suppress overheated credit and consumption, stimulate savings, increase effective investment within a certain amount of money, and improve effective supply.

Rep.: Can Chinese enterprises bear the increase in loan interest rates?

Shen: The key issue here is to seriously implement the industrial policy and truly implement the policy of tilting support. For short-term industries, appropriate preferential policies should be adopted, and in the overall contraction, there should be both support and assistance, so that the industrial structure can be gradually adjusted and the overall economy can be coordinated. At the same time, we must insist on deepening the reform, that is, the problems we currently face must be solved through deeper, more powerful, and more practical reforms. For example, enterprise reform has achieved some results, but we have not found a matching method to make enterprises come alive, nor have we found a way to make enterprises that should "die" die properly. Some enterprises that should "die" cannot die. The bankruptcy of state-owned enterprises results in the loss of state assets, and the unemployed also need to be taken care of by the state. The bankruptcy of other types of enterprises is also feared to affect social stability. These issues obviously need comprehensive matching reforms to solve. In short, the situation is forcing us to reform. When we explore the methods to control inflation, we should not use some methods that have long been proven ineffective as "new prescriptions," but should strive to explore new paths and methods, and firmly deepen the reform. Only in this way can the rectification and adjustment achieve the expected results.

　　通货膨胀与经济发展   
    ——访全国总工会研究人员沈光祖
    本报记者  蒋亚平
    ●一定的经济增长伴随着一定的通货膨胀是世界性经济现象●如果出现“滞胀”，力争把它变成更有效发展经济的契机●治理膨胀成功的办法是在调整结构、提高利率上下功夫
    沈光祖同志多年潜心研究世界经济。最近他就治理通货膨胀问题，向记者谈了自己的看法。
    记者（下简称记）：目前，我国出现了明显的通货膨胀。前几年，有人认为“通货膨胀无害”，“是经济增长的润滑剂”，现在，对这种观点的指责很多。
    沈光祖（下简称沈）：谈通货膨胀，必须分清是轻度还是严重通货膨胀。这两年我国发生的明显的通货膨胀，已超出了国家、企业、个人的承受力，必须引起足够的注意。
    记：您这样谈，是否可以理解为这里面有个“度”的问题，不同程度的通货膨胀对经济的影响是不同的？
    沈：这个问题涉及通货膨胀和经济增长的关系，很复杂，必须具体分析。我们首先不谈通货膨胀对经济发展是否有益，应当看到，当代一个不可忽视的世界性经济现象是，一定的经济增长总是伴随着一定的通货膨胀，这不以人的意志为转移。
    比如说，在１９５０年至１９７０年中，发达国家国民生产总值年增长率平均在４％至５％之间，日本曾高达１０％以上。１９７３年与１９５０年相比，日本的国民生产总值增长了２８．１倍，法国１１．７倍，意大利、联邦德国都是９倍以上，英国６．２倍，美国４．５倍。一些发展中国家和地区也是如此。据世界银行估算，１９８８年南朝鲜、印度、新加坡等国民生产总值增长率达８％。
    与此同时，各国通货膨胀率也不断上升，１９５０年到１９７０年，发达国家通货膨胀年均增长率为6．７％，发展中国家则为１３．８％。１９７０年后，通货膨胀率大幅度上升，发达国家最高的达１５％以上，发展中国家平均达３７．７％。通货膨胀表现为一种货币现象，在一般情况下，凡货币流通量超过社会物质供应量时就会发生，这时物价上涨，币值下跌。这在本世纪是普遍现象。以美国为例，１９３２年的２．５万美元，要相当于１９８８年的２０万美元。
    从上面的回述我们可以看出，通货膨胀是同经济发展同时存在的。至少在西方市场经济制度下是如此。因为银根宽松，生产资金充裕，企业能从通货膨胀中获取更多的利润；同时，通货膨胀还能相应刺激社会购买力，从而刺激生产的发展。我国正在逐步发展市场经济，这种机制也会发生一定的作用。从这点上讲，在出现通货膨胀时必须严加注意，但不必惊慌失措，甚至乱开药方，下“虎狼药”。
    记：西方经济学界不同学派对通货膨胀有不同的看法。一是凯恩斯学派，认为通货膨胀可以刺激消费，有助于发展生产，扩大就业。７０年代后又兴起了货币主义学派，则认为，通货膨胀会造成大量投机，减少生产性投资，导致经济不稳定。
    沈：这两种学派的对立，其实不是像人们说的那样大，不过是各自的侧重点不同。凯恩斯学派也没有主张无限制地发行货币，只是在当时特定的经济环境下，对稳定货币注意不够；同样，货币主义学派也没有笼统地反对通货膨胀，他们也认为，通货膨胀对经济发展确会产生作用，关键是要适度。这个度，一般被认作是３％—５％，最多不能超过１０％。
    记：我国近两年发生的通货膨胀显然已经大大超过了这个度。国家统计局公布的１９８８年物价上涨指数为１８．３％，其中１９８８年１１月生活费用价格指数比１９８７年同月上升了３０．３％，城市上涨幅度更大些。所以，政府采取了严厉的措施来治理通货膨胀，整顿经济秩序。但是，似乎又出现了一些新的问题。有些人很担心会出现“滞胀”。
    沈：“滞胀”这种现象与因生产过剩引起的生产萎缩、物价猛跌的情况正好相反。一种解释认为，主要是由于政府先期采取了扩张性的财政货币政策，使通货膨胀急剧上升；又采取了紧缩性的财政货币政策，引起生产萎缩。当这两种政策效应出现重叠时，便产生“滞胀”。现在很多人担心出现“滞胀”，我认为有些道理，因为我国前几年起发行的货币所产生的经济效应刚刚展开，而近半年的紧缩则已起作用。事实上，“滞胀”的影子已经罩在了头上，主要表现为当前通货膨胀未得到有效控制，一些重要生产部门却又因资金不足而开始出现停滞。据国家统计局公布今年一季度的情况，物价总水平仍居高不下。
    记：这是个十分棘手的问题。我国的通货膨胀，本来在很大程度上是因为产业结构不合理导致有效供给不足引起的。目前的治理整顿，若应对不当，就有可能不仅压不下通货膨胀，反倒进一步恶化了有效供给。
    沈：所以，我认为我们在采取对策时要十分慎重，对治整的复杂性有充分估计。首先要确立这样的认识，如果出现“滞胀”苗头，就不应简单地只是把它看作“坏事”就完了，而应现实地、有信心地把解决“滞胀”看作是又一个发展经济的契机。在西方，他们解决“滞胀”的过程，也就是总结以前经验教训、更有效地发展经济的过程。所以，如同对通货膨胀的态度一样，对出现滞胀也不要害怕，尤其不能惊慌失措。
    记：您认为在解决“滞胀”时应注意什么？
    沈：在解决“滞胀”时，还是应该坚定不移地把控制通货膨胀放在第一位，不能简单地重开货币的闸门，尤其当前的许多信息未必是真实准确的。但是，治理通货膨胀却有不同的作法。世界其他各国的经验证明，用冻结物价的办法来治理通货膨胀，效果普遍不好。成功的办法都是在提高利率、调整结构上下功夫，这样可以抑制过热的信贷和消费，刺激储蓄，增加一定货币量内的有效投资，提高有效供给。
    记：提高贷款利率，我国的企业能否承受得了？
    沈：这里很关键的问题就是要认真按照产业政策，切实贯彻倾斜政策。对于短线行业采取适当的优惠政策，在整体压缩中有保有扶，这样才有可能逐步调整产业结构，保证整个经济协调发展。同时必须坚持深化改革，即我们目前所面临的问题，仍必须通过更深层，更有力，更切实的改革来解决。例如企业改革，已经取得一些成效，但我们既没有找到使企业活起来的配套办法，也没有找到使该“死”的企业妥善“死”去的办法，有一些盲目发展的企业本该“死”的，却“死”不了。国有制企业破产，财产损失是国家的，失业人员也要由国家负担。其他所有制企业破产，又怕失业人员影响社会安定。这些，显然都需要进行综合配套的体制改革来解决。总之，形势逼着我们非改不可。我们在探讨治理通货膨胀办法时，不能把一些早已证明走不通的“老办法”作为“新药方”，而应努力探索新路子、新方法，坚定不移深化改革，这样，治理整顿才会达到预期目的。
