Yesterday, Beijing was under a scorching sun. Starting in the afternoon, the procession on East and West Chang'an Streets and around the square seemed endless.

Most enterprises and institutions have resumed their normal work order, and the sound of students reciting lessons can be heard in primary and secondary schools.
