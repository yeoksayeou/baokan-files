Xinhua News Agency, Putuo, May 8th

The main fish-producing area in China, Putuo District of Zhejiang's Zhoushan City, has a large accumulation of fish products. The Taohua Fishery Company, which has a 3,000-ton cold storage facility, has been full for three months, and the fresh horsehead fish being processed now has to be transported to cold storage facilities outside the area for temporary storage.

Putuo District has more than 10 large and small aquatic product cold storage facilities suitable for storing horsehead fish. Currently, there are 12,000 tons of "three-less" (headless, skinless, and gutted) horsehead fish, nearly 1,000 tons of fish fillets, and 2 million cans of canned fish accumulated, almost filling all the fish storage facilities to capacity. Some even have corridors and passages piled high with fresh, evenly sized "three-less" horsehead fish. These fish products, valued at over 100 million yuan, are causing difficulties for the more than 100 fishing boats that will be deployed for "light enclosure net" fishing in late June. Currently, cold storage workers are having trouble getting paid, fishing boats are short of diesel, fishermen cannot sell their fish, and production funds are in crisis as the fishing season approaches.

It is understood that fish markets in various places are not yet saturated, and some aquatic products are still in short supply, either rationed or imported using foreign exchange. Putuo District fishermen urgently hope that relevant departments will open up supply and marketing channels to alleviate the urgent situation in the fishing area.

### 普陀万余吨海鱼积压　渔民切盼疏通供求运销渠道

　　普陀万余吨海鱼积压
  　渔民切盼疏通供求运销渠道
    全国主要产鱼基地浙江舟山市普陀区鱼货大量积压。拥有３０００吨级的桃花渔业公司冷库３个月前即已爆满，正在加工的鲜马面鱼不得不运往外地冷库“借宿”。
    普陀区拥有１０多座具备贮藏马面鱼条件的大小水产冷库，现已积压着“三去”（去头、去皮、去内脏）马面鱼１．２万余吨、鱼片近１０００吨、鱼罐头２００余万瓶，几乎使所有鱼库全部爆满，有的连走廊、通道上都满堆着鲜度高、条子匀的“三去”马面鱼。价值上亿元的这些鱼货积压给６月下旬将有１００余条渔船投入“灯光围网”的渔业生产带来难题，目前，冷库职工发工资困难，渔轮灌柴油缺钱，渔民无法出售鱼货，渔汛到来之际生产资金告急。
    据悉，各地鱼货市场并未饱和，有的水产品尚属紧缺，或凭票定量供应，或依靠外汇进口。普陀区渔民急盼有关部门疏通供求运销渠道，以解渔区燃眉之急。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　浙江舟山市普陀区　徐博龙
