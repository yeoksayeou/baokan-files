The coal waste pile of the market coal mine located to the west of our bureau is situated in a residential area. The coal in this waste pile has been burning continuously for years without extinguishing, releasing highly toxic sulfur dioxide gas, seriously endangering the health of tens of thousands of residents. We have repeatedly reported this issue to the municipal environmental protection department, but it remains unresolved to this day.

　　火常燃毒常放居民遭殃
    我局西面的市中煤矿位于居民区。这个煤矿的矸子山煤炭长年自燃不熄，放出毒性很强的二氧化硫气体，严重地威胁数以万计的居民健康。我们曾多次向市环保部门反映，但至今得不到解决。
