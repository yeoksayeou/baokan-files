The current Arab Summit opened today in Casablanca, Morocco. The 22 member states of the Arab League, except Lebanon, attended the first public session of the summit, which was presided over by King Hassan II of Morocco. The venue was set in the Royal Palace of Casablanca.

King Hassan II delivered the opening speech. He said that the convening of this summit reflects a "new spirit of awakening and responsibility in Arab relations," and that the Arab League is moving towards unity. He emphasized that the Arab Cooperation Council and the Arab League complement each other, "driving Arab joint action to a new leap."

The King warmly welcomed Egypt's return to the Arab League and positively evaluated Egypt's sacrifices alongside its brotherly countries for the Arab nation since 1948.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak then delivered a lengthy speech, comprehensively outlining Egypt's stance on current Arab affairs. His remarks were met with applause from leaders, including Muammar Gaddafi.

When discussing the Palestinian and Lebanese issues, Mubarak reaffirmed Egypt's commitment to supporting the just cause of Palestine. He stated that Egypt supports the success of the Arab Six-Nation Committee in mediating the Lebanese crisis, aiming to "achieve the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Lebanon."

Before the public session, Arab leaders held a round of secret meetings, with bilateral and multilateral consultations among the delegations. The leaders of Syria, Libya, Egypt, and Tunisia held a friendly meeting.
