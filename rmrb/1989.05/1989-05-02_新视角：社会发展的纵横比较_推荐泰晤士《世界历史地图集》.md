A New Perspective: A Comparative Analysis of Social Development
—— Recommending the Times Atlas of World History

This year, there seem to be an unusually high number of significant anniversaries both domestically and internationally. In China, we have the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, and the 2540th anniversary of Confucius's birth. Globally, we have the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, the 200th anniversary of George Washington's inauguration as the first President of the United States, and the 300th anniversary of the birth of Montesquieu.

If these were merely coincidences of numbers, they would be of little significance. However, when we compare the social content of events from the same periods in China and the West, we cannot help but feel ashamed. When our Confucius was already a scholar, Western Europe and North America were still in a state of primal chaos. While the Industrial Revolution was in full swing in Britain, Montesquieu proposed the theory of separation of powers in his "The Spirit of the Laws," the "Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen" raised the banner of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and the U.S. Constitution, initiated by Washington, established the term limits for the presidency, China was still basking in the so-called "Qianlong Era." Domestically, it was a time of severe literary inquisitions and mass executions, while externally, China arrogantly rejected Britain's requests for trade and diplomatic relations with the attitude of "the Celestial Empire rules over all under heaven." Even until recently, we have used the excuse of "not fitting the national conditions" to delay and resist basic political reforms that were long overdue.

So, how do we understand the gaps in social development, the experiences, and the lessons? This requires comparison—comparison across time and space. The development of society is the extension of history, embodying its temporality. It is in this sense that Marx and Engels said that social sciences are historical sciences, i.e., the sciences of human social development. At the same time, any historical activity must have an objective stage, exhibiting a certain spatial scale. This objective stage of historical evolution is the geographical environment, which is the subject of geographical studies. Therefore, Marx and Engels also said that all historical accounts should begin with these natural conditions (the natural physiological basis of humanity and the geographical environment, etc.). The temporal and spatial relationship of social development is the objective basis for our comparative analysis.

If we only understand one coordinate, like the traditional way of thinking, we are accustomed to single-dimensional, vertical comparisons, and we only look to the past. We are either proud of how much progress we have made compared to old societies or primitive societies, or we comfort ourselves with the idea of having a "long history." After opening up, when we gained a horizontal perspective, we suddenly discovered the vast gap between us and the developed countries of the world. Originally, we were as calm as an ancient well, but now we are as anxious as a burning flame. Thus, we rush to achieve results without considering the conditions, often ending up with the opposite effect, wanting to hurry but not achieving our goals. These two forms of one-dimensional comparison lead to psychological imbalances, causing people to oscillate between "Great Leap Forward" and "slow and steady," between arrogance and anxiety, and even despair. In terms of cognition, it all boils down to a lack of global vision and an inability to grasp the laws of social and historical development—this is precisely the object of interdisciplinary research in social development theory.

Edited by the renowned British historian and former Oxford University professor Geoffrey Barraclough, and written by 80 Western scholars, the Times Atlas of World History provides us with such a model for comparative analysis. The book, with approximately 600 exquisite color maps and 127 textual essays, comprehensively depicts the movement and development of human history from the origins of humanity to 1975, showcasing the different levels of development of human civilization in various historical periods, as well as the rise and fall and achievements of different civilizations in history. Moreover, the book uses a comparative format, listing major historical events and cultural and technological achievements from various regions of the world from 9000 BC to 1975 (with some extending to 1976), making it easy to understand. Although it is a work by Western scholars, it has, to a certain extent, changed the old view of presenting world history centered on Europe. It provides a macroscopic explanation of the forms and development of various major aspects of human social life, avoiding the piling up and fragmentation of events. Additionally, it is meticulously crafted in terms of cartography, truly deserving of the description "words and pictures together." Reading such a book is not only about acquiring knowledge but also a form of enjoyment. The Chinese version published by the Sanlian Bookstore in 1982 is its eighth language edition. I believe it is not only worth reading for historians and geographers but also for anyone who wants to understand the origins and development of human civilization, especially those who care about the development of China and humanity and hope to rationally address China's reality. This is why I, who am neither a historian nor a geographer, recommend this book to the readers.

### 新视角：社会发展的纵横比较——推荐泰晤士《世界历史地图集》

　　新视角：社会发展的纵横比较    
    ——推荐泰晤士《世界历史地图集》
    张琢
    今年成整数的中外纪念日似乎特别多。从本国数，由近及远，新中国成立４０周年，“五四”７０周年，还有“孔圣诞”２５４０年；从世界看，有法国大革命２００周年，华盛顿就任美国第一任总统２００周年，还有孟德斯鸠诞生３００周年。
    如果这仅是些数字的巧合，也就不过是数字的巧合而已。但是，如果将中外同一时期事件的社会内容作一横向比较，就使我们不能不汗颜：当我们的孔夫子已在那里文诌诌的时候，西欧和北美还是洪荒世界；而当英国工业革命如火如荼地进行，孟德斯鸠在“理性和自由的法典”《论法的精神》中提出立法、行政、司法三权分离的学说，《人权宣言》高扬自由、平等、博爱的旗帜，美国宪法规定并由华盛顿率先实行总统任期限期制的时候，中国却还陶醉于“乾隆盛世”，对内大兴文字狱，株连抄斩，对外以“天朝抚有四海”的傲慢态度拒绝了英国通商、驻使的要求。甚至直到不久前，我们还在以“不合国情”为种种理由，拒绝和拖延着已远远落后的起码的政治改革。
    那么，社会发展的差距，经验与教训，怎样才能找到呢？这就要比较——古今中外纵横比较。社会的发展就是历史的延伸，从而体现出它的时间性，正是在这个意义上马克思恩格斯说社会科学都是历史科学，即人类社会发展的历史的科学。同时，任何历史活动都要有客观的舞台，都要展现出一定的空间规模，这个历史演进的客观舞台便是作为地理学研究对象的地理环境，因此，马恩又说，一切历史的记述都应从这个自然条件（人类自身的自然生理基础和地理环境等）开始。社会发展的这种时空关系就是我们纵横比较的客观基础。
    如果我们只晓得其中的一个坐标，像传统思维方式那样，习惯于单一的纵向比较，而且只是面向过去，既以比旧社会、比原始社会有了如何如何的长进而自得，又以“历史悠久”而自慰。在开放以后，横向的视角一打开，才忽然发现与世界发达国家的悬殊差距。原来是心如古井，这一下又心急如焚，于是便不顾条件，急于求成，又总是适得其反，欲速不达。这两种单向比较的片面性造成心理失衡，使人们在“大跃进”与“慢慢来”，自负与焦躁，甚至灰心丧气中颠来倒去。从认识上看，说到底都是缺乏世界见识，没有把握社会历史的发展规律——这正是作为跨学科的社会发展理论研究的对象。
    由英国著名历史学家、前牛津大学讲座教授杰弗里·巴勒克拉夫主编，８０位西方学者执笔撰文的泰晤士《世界历史地图集》为我们提供了这样一个纵横比较的范本。该书以约６００幅精制的彩色地图与１２７篇文字论述相映照，全面描绘了人类起源到１９７５年为下限的人类历史的运动和发展，表现了人类文明在各个历史时期所形成的不同发展水平，以及不同文明在历史上的兴衰和成就。而且本书还用对照形式，选列从公元前９０００年至公元１９７５年（个别到１９７６年）世界各大地区的重大历史事件和文化、科技成就进行了比较，叫人一目了然。它虽然是西方学者合作的成果，却在一定程度上改变了过去以欧洲为中心阐述世界历史的旧观点，宏观地阐述了人类社会生活各主要方面的形式和发展，避免了事件的堆砌和割裂；而且在制图工艺方面十分考究，真正称得上文图并茂。读这种书，不仅是求知，也是一种享受。由中国三联书店１９８２年出版的中文版为它的第八种文字版本。我以为不仅值得历史学家、地理学家一读，且对一切想要了解人类文明的来龙去脉的人，尤其是对关心中国和人类的发展，希望理性地对待中国的现实的人们，都是值得一读的。这也就是既非历史学家，也非地理学者的我，要向读者推荐这本书的缘由。
