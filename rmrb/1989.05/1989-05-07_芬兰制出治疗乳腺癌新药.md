Finland's Farmos Company has successfully developed a new drug named Fareston, which has shown good results in treating breast cancer.

The main ingredient of Fareston is toremifene (phonetic transcription), which is highly effective in treating postmenopausal elderly women with breast cancer. The drug has minimal side effects, and patients in the late stages of breast cancer can take large doses.

Clinical treatment shows that among 46 patients aged 46 to 80 with metastatic breast cancer, 17% saw their tumors disappear after taking a 60-milligram pill of toremifene every morning. In 37% of the cases, the tumors shrank by at least half, and 26% of the patients experienced stable conditions with no further development of the disease for 3 to 17 months after taking the medication. Toremifene is particularly effective against lesions that have spread to the skin, lymph nodes, and lungs, and it also has an effect on bone lesions.

　　芬兰制出治疗乳腺癌新药
    新华社赫尔辛基五月四日电  芬兰法莫斯公司研制成功的名为法雷斯通的新药对治疗乳腺癌有较好效果。
    法雷斯通药的主要成份是托雷米费尼（音译），它对治疗绝经后的老年妇女乳腺癌具有显著疗效。该药副作用小，乳腺癌晚期病人可以大剂量服用。
    临床治疗表明，四十六名四十六至八十岁的已出现扩散的乳腺癌患者每天早晨服用托雷米费尼含量为六十毫克的药片，其中百分之十七的人癌肿消失，百分之三十七的癌肿至少缩小一半，百分之二十六的患者在服药后的三至十七个月内病情稳定不再发展。托雷米费尼对扩散至皮肤、淋巴以及肺部的病灶疗效尤为显著，对骨中病灶也有作用。
