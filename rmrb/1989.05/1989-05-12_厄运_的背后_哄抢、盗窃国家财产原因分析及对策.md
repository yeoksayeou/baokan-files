Behind the Misfortune
— Analysis of Causes and Countermeasures for Plundering and Theft of State Property

Editor's Note: In recent times, many letters to the editor have reported issues of plundering and theft of state property. Our reporter conducted interviews with relevant departments such as public security, railways, energy, and petroleum. The investigative report "Behind the Misfortune" reflects the severe damage suffered by these "major victims" of theft, explores the causes of this abnormal social phenomenon, and proposes countermeasures to draw the attention of the entire society. We hope that relevant departments will take corresponding measures to address this issue from a macro and fundamental perspective, preventing state property from continuing to suffer the "misfortune" of plundering and theft.

In early February, a document from the Ministry of Public Security stated: "In recent years, criminal activities involving the theft and illegal sale of communication equipment, facilities, and industrial raw materials from the railway, petroleum, and power sectors have been particularly prominent."

The reporter extracted the following figures from materials provided by relevant departments of the State Council and other relevant units for the year 1988:

Ministry of Railways: The total number of cases involving the plundering and theft of transported goods, railway materials, internal materials, and passenger belongings was 17,406, with a direct economic loss of 25 million yuan.

Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications: The total number of cases involving the destruction of postal and telecommunications lines was 1,299, with 920,000 meters of telephone lines stolen, 12,000 meters of trunk and local telephone cables, 1,100 telegraph poles, and communication interruptions totaling 3.126 million route-minutes, resulting in a direct loss of 3.819 million yuan.

Ministry of Energy: The six major oil fields of Daqing, Shengli, Zhongyuan, Huabei, Dagang, and Nanyang reported a total of 2,100 cases (including over 1,500 major cases), with 800,000 tons of crude oil stolen and 200 million kilowatt-hours of production electricity, amounting to a loss of 120 million yuan.

State Forestry Administration: There were 5,314 cases of plundering timber and 38,000 cases of theft, resulting in the destruction of 28,000 mu of forest, 150,000 cubic meters of timber, and a loss of 16.278 million yuan.

Most departments do not have comprehensive statistics, but even partial statistics are shocking. In Ningxiang County, Hunan Province, there were 80 cases of theft of water conservancy facilities in the Huangcai Reservoir last year. The Shanghai Commercial Storage and Transportation Company, under the Ministry of Commerce, suffered a loss of 2.66 million yuan due to plundering and theft. A relevant person from the People's Insurance Company of China introduced that last year, 50 million yuan was compensated to customers due to theft cases, accounting for 30% of the total claim amount of 1.5 billion yuan.

The above figures are only incomplete and minimum statistics. The direct economic losses caused by various plundering and theft incidents are astonishing, but the social benefits lost due to train delays, communication interruptions, oil field drilling stops, forest destruction, and ecological damage are impossible to quantify with simple numbers.

The public security organs have exhausted all means to protect state property from plundering and theft, taking measures to crack down on criminals. However, the incidence rate of such cases continues to rise. This is indeed thought-provoking: what are the reasons? What is the way out to solve this problem?

Imbalanced Psychology and Extreme Behavior

China's thousands of years of feudal economic system and the traditional culture based on it have emphasized suppressing people's desire for money, instilling the moral concept of "valuing righteousness over profit." The idea of "gentlemen understand righteousness, petty men understand profit" has had a profound impact on people. After liberation, and even during the 10-year Cultural Revolution, we viewed personal interests and money issues one-sidedly, even equating money with filth, ashamed to mention it, resulting in people's abnormal psychology of "money phobia." In recent years, with the policy of opening up to the outside world and revitalizing the economy, commodity economy has developed rapidly, and people's legitimate material desires and needs have been affirmed, changing their concepts of "money" and "personal interests." However, in this drastic transformation, due to various reasons, necessary moral education and effective social constraints have not kept up, causing some people's psychology to become imbalanced, developing from a legitimate desire for money and material to extreme behavior of seeking profit at all costs and "everything for money." "Getting rich without forgetting the Guikun line, making money without forgetting the steamed bun shop." The steamed bun shop is a tunnel on the Guikun railway line. Due to the settlement of the roadbed, trains passing through here are limited to a speed of 5 kilometers per hour. The road is dangerous and the train is slow, making it a paradise for criminals. From January to October last year, this section reported 94 cases of plundering and theft, becoming a "gold mine" for some people to get rich through illegal means. "If you want to get rich, steal from the railway, and become a millionaire overnight" has become a reality.

The long-lasting feudal society also created the psychology of egalitarianism and mutual comparison among small producers. Seeing others "get rich," those who have not "got rich" develop red-eye disease and jealousy, but have no way to get rich. Thus, a few people do not hesitate to take extreme actions that harm national interests. This is another important psychological factor for many plunderers and thieves of state property.

China is currently in the stage of economic transformation. The transition from old to new systems and the activation of ideological concepts have caused some people's psychology to become imbalanced and prone to extremism, even losing national consciousness. While vigorously carrying out social ideological and moral education, it is also necessary to rely on the external force of the law, adopting a dual approach to form an effective constraint mechanism.

Lack of Power and Law Enforcement Confusion

Currently, departments such as posts and telecommunications, forestry, energy, water conservancy, and transportation are often under dual leadership. Some local leaders prioritize local and regional interests, interfering with the law enforcement and case handling of departmental public security organs. Coupled with a tight network of relationships and a thick atmosphere of intercession, some criminals are caught and released, and some ringleaders even roam freely. Some local public security organs also find it difficult to enforce the law impartially due to various reasons. Although departments such as railways, petroleum, posts and telecommunications, and forestry have their own public security organs, it is difficult to enforce the law strictly.

During the interviews, these departmental public security organs reflected that the powers granted to them are limited. For example, the public security organs of the petroleum department have different powers granted by local governments, some with investigative powers but without pre-trial powers; some with administrative detention powers but without criminal detention powers; some with custody and interrogation powers, and some without. Some departmental public security organs can only exercise part of the powers granted by the local public security bureau. This undoubtedly ties their hands. Streamlining the public security management system is not just about expanding powers, but more importantly, establishing a matching procuratorial and judicial system. The Huabei Oil Field is distributed across 26 counties and cities in Hebei Province, but only has a public security system without corresponding procuratorates and courts. After filing a case, they must deal with the procuratorates and courts of 26 counties and cities. Due to various reasons, many cases cannot be handled in a timely or fair manner, making some criminals fearless and rampant. The state should streamline the procuratorial and judicial systems of these departments from a macro perspective, giving them the power and guarantee to enforce the law, truly deterring criminals.

Local Expansion and Overall Shrinkage

A deputy director of the Forestry Public Security Bureau told the reporter that some local leaders even proposed the shortsighted slogan of "making money from the mountains and forests," inciting local residents to plunder and steal state timber. Since 1985, Dongfang County in Hainan decided that the county forestry bureau would organize five logging teams to enter the Jiangbian forest area of Jianfengling Forestry Bureau, using unclear forest rights boundaries as an excuse, logging 11,490 mu of forest and 11,594 cubic meters of timber.

The "walls" formed by small refineries and refinery furnaces have surrounded some of the country's major oil fields. Some small refineries, unable to obtain crude oil through legal channels, take shortcuts by purchasing from farmers. This production method undoubtedly encourages lawbreakers to plunder and steal state crude oil, while some local governments tacitly approve it, and some small refineries even obtain business licenses. Farmers near the Nanyang Oil Field in Henan Province, from individuals to gangs, from night to day, from bicycles to tractors, boldly carry out theft! Almost every village near the oil field has a refinery.

Our cadres should, in theory, prioritize national interests. But why do some people harm national interests? One reason is that some local organizations, when evaluating and promoting cadres, use whether the masses earned a few more yuan during their term as a major criterion for assessing performance, without considering comprehensive social benefits. This will inevitably encourage some cadres to prioritize regional interests and short-term behavior. There are also a few grassroots cadres who lead in doing things that benefit themselves but harm the country. On the Guikun railway line, some village cadres even organize residents to plunder and steal state property, and stipulate that those who are arrested or injured for this reason will be taken care of by the village or themselves.

Therefore, from this perspective, to view the problem of plundering and stealing state property, when evaluating and appointing cadres, we must not only look at how much benefit they have brought to the local area but also look at whether the means of obtaining it are legal and whether it harms national interests, thus conducting a comprehensive and scientific evaluation of cadres.

Chaotic Channels and Fertile Soil for Fencing Stolen Goods

Chaotic procurement channels provide fertile soil for plunderers and thieves, giving criminals wings.

Some large steel plants exchange or set up points to purchase a large amount of scrap metal. Some enterprises in Beijing have signed contracts with material recovery departments in some cities and counties in Hebei Province to exchange new steel for old steel at a ratio of 1:3. The Beijing Public Security Bureau alone has seized over 100 times the "scrap metal" sent to these enterprises by Hebei farmers, seizing 1,100 tons of "scrap metal," some of which are unused construction steel!

In recent years, the people of Dongfang and Ledong Counties in Hainan Province have repeatedly stolen state-protected rare trees, Huili wood, despite strict prohibitions. The main reason is the chaotic procurement channels.

In the area from the Gangxi Oil Field to the Kongdian Oil Field in the Dagang Oil Field, farmers' donkey carts and bicycles loaded with crude oil go to small refineries to deliver goods every day. It is estimated that these small refineries purchase 15-20 tons of crude oil per day.

In the past, the recovery of waste materials was managed uniformly by the state, and the material and commercial departments uniformly purchased them. After the waste material recovery market was opened in 1986, the procurement departments were diversified, including those from the material and commercial systems and township enterprises. The former two are state-owned, and most procurement units pay attention to the source of waste. However, the latter's procurement points mostly do not ask about the source and purchase everything. Thus, many unlicensed individuals have started the "junk king" business, going from village to village and along the streets to collect. Some set up camp near large state-owned enterprises, making the enterprises' materials often stolen, and the enterprises fall into a state of being unable to defend themselves.

The various drawbacks of the waste material recovery system have stimulated the growth of plundering and theft behavior. The fundamental solution is to reform the unreasonable recovery system and unify the management of procurement work. At the same time, regulations should be made for the scope and types of procurement, and strict examinations should be conducted for some items and sellers.

It is undeniable that there are also problems in the systems and management within these departments to varying degrees. For example, the petroleum department stipulates that work is completed and materials are cleaned up, but some oil wells have not achieved this. Again, the railway freight department does not strictly enforce regulations, and the management of railway freight tickets is poor; railway employees steal from their posts, etc.

In summary, to prevent state property from being plundered and stolen, the whole society needs to pay high attention, because this is not just a matter of cracking down, but more importantly, to establish a good social atmosphere and moral image. It is necessary for the central and local governments to jointly take measures, diagnose the problem, and comprehensively treat it. (With pictures)

　　“厄运”的背后   
    ——哄抢、盗窃国家财产原因分析及对策
    本报记者  李仲春
    编者按：最近一段时间，本报收到的读者来信中，反映哄抢、盗窃国家财产问题的相当多。记者就此问题到公安、铁道、能源、石油等部门进行了采访。《“厄运”的背后》这篇记者调查反映的正是这些“被盗大户”受到的严重损害，探讨造成这种畸形社会现象的原因和对策，以引起全社会的重视。希望各主管部门采取相应措施，从宏观上、根本上加以解决，避免国家财产继续遭受哄抢、盗窃的“厄运”。　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    ２月初，公安部的一份材料中写道：“近年来，盗窃、倒卖铁路、石油、电力等部门的通讯器材、设施和工业原料的犯罪活动相当突出。”
    记者从国务院有关部门和其他有关单位提供的１９８８年的材料中摘取了如下数字：
    铁道部：全年哄抢、盗窃运输物资、铁路器材、内部物资、旅客财物四项共发案１７４０６起，直接经济损失２５００万元。
    邮电部：全年邮电通信线路遭破坏的案件为１２９９起，被盗电话线９２万多米，干线和市内电话电缆１．２万米，电杆１１００多根，阻断通信历时３１２．６万路分，直接损失３８１．９万元。
    能源部：大庆、胜利、中原、华北、大港、南阳６个大油田，全年共发案２１００起（其中重大案件１５００多起），被抢原油８０万吨，被窃生产用电２亿度，两项折合１．２亿元。
    林业部：全年哄抢林木案５３１４起，盗窃案３．８万多起。两项毁林２．８万亩，计１５万多立方米木材，折合１６２７．８万元。
    多数部门没有全面的统计数字，局部的统计也足以令人瞠目。水利系统的湖南宁乡县境内的黄材水库，去年发生盗窃水利设施案８０起；商业部所属上海商业储运公司，去年因哄抢、盗窃损失２６６万元；中国人民保险公司有关同志介绍，去年因盗窃案赔偿客户５０００万元，占索赔总额１．５亿元的３０％之多。
    以上这些数字，仅仅是不完全的、最低限度上的统计。各种哄抢、盗窃造成的直接经济损失固然惊人，而哄抢、盗窃使列车停车、脱轨、晚点；通信中断；油田钻井停钻；森林被毁、生态遭破坏等等，因此而造成社会效益的损失，是无法简单地用数字来统计的。
    公安机关为使国家财产免遭哄抢、盗窃，使出了浑身解数，采取措施，打击犯罪分子。但是，此类案发率仍呈上升趋势。这确实令人深思：原因何在？解决这一问题的出路在哪里？
    失衡的心理　极端的行为
    我国几千年的封建经济形式，以及建立在其上的传统文化，更重于抑制人们的金钱欲念，灌输“重义轻利”的道德观。“君子喻于义，小人喻于利”的观念给人们深刻的影响。解放后，乃至１０年“文革”中，我们较片面地看待个人利益和金钱的问题，甚至把金钱和铜臭划为等号，耻于提及，造成了人们“谈钱色变”的变态心理。近几年，在对外开放，搞活经济的形势下，商品经济日益发展，人们正当的物质利益欲望和需求受到了肯定，对“金钱”和“个人利益”的观念有了变化。但是，在这场剧烈的变革中，由于种种原因，必要的道德教育和有效的社会约束没有跟上，致使一些人的心理失去平衡，已由对金钱、物质的正当欲求发展到唯利是图、“一切向钱看”的极端。“致富不忘贵昆线，发财不忘粑粑店”。粑粑店是贵昆铁路线上的一个隧道，因路基下沉，列车至此限时速５公里。路险车慢，犯罪分子如鱼得水。去年１至１０月份，这一段共发生９４起哄盗案，成了一些人靠不义之财致富的“金银窝”。“要想富，偷铁路，一夜一个万元户”已是活生生的现实。
    悠久的封建社会，同时也造就了小生产者的平均主义、互相攀比的心理。眼看着别人“发”了，那些未“发”的人红眼病发作，妒火中烧，但又致富无门，生财少道。于是，少数人就不惜采取有损国家利益的极端行为。这是许多哄盗国家资财者的另一重要心理因素。
    我国目前正处在经济变革阶段，新旧体制的交替，思想观念的活跃，有些人心理失衡而易走极端，甚至他们已失去了国家意识。在大力进行社会思想和道德教育的同时，还要靠法律的外力作用，采取双管齐下的方式，形成有效的约束机制。
    权力的匮乏　执法的困惑
    目前，邮电、林业、能源、水利和交通等部门多属双重领导。有些地方的领导人以局部、地区利益为重，干预部门公安机关执法办案。加上严密的关系网，浓厚的说情风，致使有些犯罪分子被捉捉放放，更有甚者，有的首恶分子逍遥法外。一些地方公安机关也因种种原因，很难秉公执法。尽管铁道、石油、邮电、林业等都有自己的公安机关，但是很难做到执法从严。
    在采访中，这些部门公安机关反映，他们被授予的权力有限。如石油部门公安机关，各地政府授予他们的权限不一，有的有侦查权，没有预审权；有的有行政拘留权，而无刑事拘留权；有的有收容审查权，有的则没有。一些部门公安机关只能行使所在地公安厅（局）所授予的部分权限。这无疑捆住了他们的手脚。理顺公安管理体制，不仅仅是扩大权限问题，更重要的是建立配套的公检法体系。华北油田分布在河北省２６个县市境内，但只有公安系统，而无相应的检察院、法院，立案后必须与２６个县市的检察院、法院打交道。由于种种原因，很多案件不能及时或公正处理，这更使有些犯罪分子有恃无恐、甚嚣尘上。国家应该从宏观上理顺这些部门的公检法体系，使他们有执法的权力和保障，真正对犯罪分子起到震慑作用。
    局部的膨胀　全局的萎缩
    林业部公安局一位副局长对记者谈到，有些地方的领导人竟然提出了“向山林要钱”这样目光短浅的口号，怂恿本地群众哄抢、盗窃国家林木。１９８５年以来，海南东方县决定，由县林业局组织５个采伐队，深入尖峰岭林业局江边林区，以林权地界不清为托辞，砍伐森林面积达１１４９０亩，砍伐林木达１１５９４立方米。
    由小炼油厂、炼油炉组成的“围墙”已包围了国家的一些大油田。一些小炼油厂从正当渠道得不到原油，就走捷径，从农民手中收购。这种生产方法无疑助长了不法分子哄抢、盗窃国家原油的行为，而一些地方政府竟然默许，有的小炼油厂还领了营业执照。河南南阳油田附近偷抢原油的农民，从单人到团伙，由夜晚变白昼，从自行车带到拖拉机运，竟明火执仗地干起来了！油田附近几乎村村有炼油炉。
    我们的干部按理说应把国家利益放在首位。但为什么有些人却损害国家的利益呢？原因之一是，一些地方的组织在考察、提拔干部时，把在任期内是否使群众多挣了几元钱，作为衡量政绩的一条主要标准，而不顾社会综合效益。这势必助长部分干部地区利益为主、短期行为领先的错误思想。也有少数基层干部带头干利己害国的事。贵昆铁路线上有些地方的村干部甚至组织群众哄抢、盗窃国家财产，并规定凡因此被捕、受伤者，一律由村里照顾其家属或本人。
    因此，从这个角度审视哄抢、盗窃国家资财的问题，在考核、任用干部时，决不能只看他们为本地区谋了多少利益，而且还要看得来的途径是否合法，是否有损国家利益，从而对干部进行全面、科学地考察。
    紊乱的渠道　销赃的沃土
    紊乱的收购渠道，为哄抢、盗窃分子提供了肥沃的土壤，使犯罪分子如虎添翼。
    一些大型钢铁厂通过串换或设点收购，大量换取、收购废旧金属。北京市有些企业与河北部分市、县物资回收部门签定了串换钢材的合同，１吨新钢材换取３吨旧钢材。仅北京市公安局就上百次查获了给这些企业送“废钢铁”的河北农民，查获“废钢铁”１１００吨，有些竟是未用的建筑钢材！
    几年来，海南省东方、乐东等县的群众盗砍国家一类保护的珍稀树木花犁木，屡禁不止。主要原因是收购渠道混乱。
    在大港油田的港西油田至孔店油田一带，每天都有农民的毛驴车和自行车载着原油去小炼油厂送货。据统计：这一带的小炼油厂每天收购原油１５—２０吨。
    过去，废旧物资收购，由国家统一管理，物资、商业部门统一收购。１９８６年废旧物资收购市场放开后，收购部门繁杂，既有物资、商业系统的，也有乡镇企业的。前两者属国营性质，大多数收购单位较注意废品来源。但后者所属的收购点多数不问来源，一律收购。这样，很多无证的个体户干起了“破烂王”的生意，走村串户，沿街收购。有的在大型国营企业附近安营扎寨，使这些企业的物资常常被盗，企业陷入防不胜防的境地。
    废旧物资回收体制的种种弊端，刺激了哄抢、盗窃行为的滋生，治本之策，应当改革不合理的回收体制，统一管理收购工作。同时应对收购的范围、品种进行规定，对一些物品和交售人进行严格审查。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    勿庸讳言，这些部门内部在制度和管理上也不同程度地存在着问题。如石油部门规定，工完料净，但部分油井并未做到。又如铁路货运部门执行规章制度不严，铁路货票管理不善；铁路职工监守自盗，等等。
    总之，要使国家财产免遭哄抢、盗窃，需要全社会高度重视，因为这不仅仅单纯是打击的问题，更重要的是要树立一种良好的社会风气、道德风貌。需从中央到地方，共同采取措施，对症下药，综合治理。　（附图片）
