Beijing citizens from various sectors continued to take to the streets in protest. Today, despite the rain, people either donned rain gear or braved the downpour, converging from all directions towards Tiananmen Square. They marched in an orderly fashion around the square before dispersing. The number of participants and onlookers along the route today was no less than yesterday. Banners with slogans such as "Children are hungry, our hearts ache" and "Save the children" were visible everywhere.

Today's protest saw a significant number of industrial workers. A contingent of 3,000 workers from Beijing Jeep Company, all dressed in blue uniforms and yellow helmets, chanted slogans as they marched forward. The reporter observed that more workers were riding in motor vehicles compared to yesterday.

Beijing Chemical Industry No. 2 Factory deployed 16 trucks, all uniform in color, drawing attention. Along Chang'an Avenue, large office buildings had banners hanging from their windows, expressing support for the students.

Today marks the sixth day of the students' hunger strike petition at Tiananmen Square. Despite the crowded scene, people voluntarily cleared wide paths to ensure the smooth passage of ambulances. The condition of the hunger-striking students is critical. According to the Beijing Emergency Center, by 6 PM today, 3,504 individuals had been treated, with 2,457 requiring further observation. Every breath taken by the students is a concern for all.

Before the rain started, Beijing Public Transport Company provided over 90 large buses to relocate the hunger-striking students indoors, shielding them from the rain. Beijing Plastic Factory donated numerous plastic sheets, and the Youth Commercial Store supplied over 10,000 plastic raincoats. Workers from Beijing Oxygen Cylinder Factory carried oxygen tanks, and others brought women's necessities. The students expressed their gratitude, saying it was very timely.

Today, many organizations also came to donate funds, including the All-China Federation of Trade Unions donating 100,000 yuan, STAC donating 50,000 yuan, and the China Democratic League of Peasants and Workers Party donating over 10,000 yuan.

Medical staff carefully tended to the hunger-striking students. On the ambulances, a doctor took off his own clothes to use as a pillow for a female student.

To prevent the spread of diseases, today, sanitation workers, taking advantage of the students being moved into the buses, conducted a thorough cleaning of the square. Epidemiologists followed up with disinfection, transforming the previously trash-strewn square into a clean environment, demonstrating their heartfelt concern.

　　首都学生绝食请愿进入第六天  各界百余万人昨继续上街游行
    本报北京５月１８日讯  首都各界人士继续上街游行。今天北京下雨，人们或打着雨具，或淋着雨，从四面八方走向天安门广场，秩序井然地绕广场一周散去。今天参加游行及在路边围观的人数，不亚于昨天。“孩子挨饿，我们心疼”、“救救孩子”等醒目横幅，随处可见。
    今天的游行队伍中产业工人较多。北京吉普有限公司３０００人的队列，一色蓝工装，黄头盔，他们不断呼喊着口号前进。记者看到，乘坐机动车辆游行的工人比昨天多了。
    北京化工二厂出动１６辆卡车，清一色，引人注目。在长安街两旁一些大的办公楼的窗外，也贴出“声援学生”的标语。
    学生在天安门广场绝食请愿今天已进入第６天。广场上虽说人山人海，但人们自觉地让出了宽宽的大道，保证穿梭往来的救护车通行无阻。绝食学生的情况危急。据北京市急救中心介绍，截至今晚６点，已救治３５０４人次，其中留下观察的２４５７人次。学生们的一呼一吸牵动着人们的心。
    在下雨之前，北京市公交公司提供了９０余辆大轿车，使绝食学生转移到车内，免受雨淋。北京塑料厂送来不少塑料薄膜，民青商店送来上万件塑料雨衣，北京氧气瓶厂工人扛来了氧气瓶，还有的送来了妇女用品。学生们感激地说，真是太及时了。
    今天，还有不少单位前来捐款，如全国总工会捐款１０万元，四通公司捐款５万元，中国农工民主党也捐赠１万余元。
    医护人员精心照料绝食学生，在救护车上，一位大夫将自己身上的衣服脱下给女学生当枕头。
    为了防止疾病传染，今天，环卫工人乘着绝食学生转移到车内的机会，对广场来了一次大清扫，防疫人员接着消毒，改变了前几天垃圾满地的处境，表现了他们的一片爱心。
