China uses three hundred million mu (approximately 20 million hectares) of land each year to produce grain for feed. If we switch to growing feed crops or feed varieties of grain crops, without expanding the area, the yield can increase by more than twenty percent. To break the stagnation in agriculture, we need to—

Improve Crop Layout and Adjust Planting and Breeding Structures

To solve or alleviate the supply-demand contradiction of grain, in addition to striving to increase grain production, I believe that adjusting China's crop layout and the structure of planting and breeding industries, and reducing the pressure of breeding on grain, is a necessity for production development and is feasible.

China is a country with a large population and a relatively backward economy. Food and clothing have always been the top priorities, so agriculture has long formed a dual structure of grain and economic crops. After solving the problem of subsistence, people's living standards have improved, incomes have increased, and it is natural and reasonable that they want to eat better. This inevitably increases the demand for animal products and other grain-transformed products, requiring planting industries to provide more feed for breeding. However, our traditional planting structure has never given feed crops a significant position, and we have to use edible grains to process feed. In recent years, the country has had to allocate 80 million tons of grain (about 20% of the total production) for breeding every year. Even so, it still cannot meet the needs of the breeding industry, and the alarm of feed shortages is often sounded. Some comrades say that the grain problem is essentially a feed problem, which is not without reason. Converting grain to feed is not impossible, but it is inefficient and uneconomical. Based on the national average yield of 242 kilograms per mu in 1987, producing 80 million tons of grain for feed requires 320 million mu of land. If we change the planting structure and use these arable lands to grow feed crops, the efficiency can be multiplied. Experiments have shown that one mu of alfalfa contains seven times the protein of wheat; green silage corn at the waxy stage has a feed value equivalent to 2-3 times that of harvested corn; if rice and corn are selected for feed varieties, the feed yield can be 150-200% of ordinary varieties. If 70% of the 320 million mu of land is used to grow feed varieties of grain crops, the yield can be increased by 20% based on the original level, and 30% is used to grow silage corn or grain-grass rotation, which can provide more concentrated and roughage feed for the breeding industry. China's arable land is already limited, and it is even more important to make full use of it and improve efficiency. According to local conditions, we should reform the traditional planting structure, reallocate land resources, and replace the traditional dual structure with a tripartite structure of grain, economic crops, and feed crops, which is inevitable.

China's breeding structure is also irrational and even distorted, matching the planting industry. The most prominent manifestation is the high proportion of grain-consuming livestock and poultry. The country raises an average of 330 million pigs annually, ranking first in the world. The proportion of grass-eating and grain-saving livestock and poultry in the breeding industry is far lower than that in developed countries and some developing countries. India, whose grain production is only about one-fourth of China's and whose population is two-thirds of China's, has ten times as many cows and one-fourth as many pigs as China. A more reasonable breeding structure allows India to meet the national demand for meat food even when grain is not very abundant, and the pressure on grain is not as great as ours. Therefore, adjusting the breeding structure, making full use of China's grassland resources and grassy hills and slopes in agricultural areas, and vigorously developing cattle, sheep, rabbits, geese, and other grass-eating livestock and poultry, can make better use of natural resources, reduce the pressure on grain, and provide more varieties of meat to the market. Both producers and consumers will benefit.

Adjusting the industrial and crop structures should be an aspect of deepening rural reforms and requires a series of supporting policies and measures. Fortunately, there has been some experience in this area in the past few years. With good work, the enthusiasm of farmers and herdsmen can be mobilized to voluntarily achieve this transformation, which is not very difficult.

　　改善作物布局调整种养结构
    我国每年要用三亿亩地产的粮食作饲料。而如果改种饲料作物或饲用品种的粮食作物，面积不扩大，产量即可提高百分之二十以上。突破农业徘徊，需要——
    改善作物布局调整种养结构
    解决或缓解粮食的供需矛盾除努力增加粮食产量外，我认为调整我国作物布局和种植业、养殖业结构，减少养殖业对粮食的压力，是生产发展的需要，也是可行的。
    我国是一个人口众多、经济比较落后的国家，吃饭、穿衣从来都放在首要位置，因而农业长期形成粮食——经济作物二元种植结构。人民在解决温饱之后，生活水平提高了，收入增加了，要求吃得好一些，是必然的也是合理的，自然对动物性食品等粮食转化品的消费需求上升，要求种植业为养殖业提供越来越多的饲料，而我们传统的种植业结构从来就没有饲料作物的地位，不得不以食用粮食加工饲料。近几年，全国每年要拿出８０００万吨粮食（占总产量的２０％左右）用于养殖业，即使这样，仍满足不了养殖业发展的需要，饲料紧缺的“警报”不时传来。有的同志说，粮食问题实质是饲料问题，不是没有道理的。粮食转化为饲料不是不可以，而是效益低，不合算。以１９８７年全国粮食平均亩产２４２公斤计算，生产８０００万吨用于饲料的粮食，需用耕地３．２亿亩，如果改变种植业结构，把这些耕地改种饲料作物，效益可成倍增加。实验证明，一亩苜蓿的蛋白质含量相当于小麦的７倍；用蜡熟期的玉米青贮，其饲用量折合成饲料单位相当于熟收玉米的２—３倍；水稻和玉米如果选用饲用品种，其所获饲料量相当于普通品种的１５０—２００％。如果在３．２亿亩耕地中用７０％种植饲用品种粮食作物，其产量可在原有基础上提高２０％，３０％用来种植青贮玉米或粮草轮作，可为养殖业提供更多精粗饲料。我国耕地本来就不多，更应充分利用，提高效益。因地制宜，对传统的种植业结构来一番改造，重新配置耕地资源，以粮食—经济作物—饲料作物三元种植结构，取代传统的二元结构，势在必行。
    我国的养殖业结构同种植业相适应，也是不合理，甚至畸形的。突出表现是耗粮畜禽比重过大，全国常年平均饲养３．３亿头猪，居世界第一位，草食和节粮型畜禽在养殖业中所占比重大大低于发达国家和一些发展中国家。同我国国情相近的印度，粮食产量只有我国的１／４强，人口是我国的２／３，他们存栏的牛是我国的１０倍，猪只有我国的１／４。比较合理的养殖业结构，使印度在粮食并不很宽裕的情况下，满足了国民对肉食的需要，粮食的压力也不像我们这样大。所以，调整养殖业结构，充分利用我国草原资源和农区的草山草坡，大力发展牛、羊、兔、鹅等草食畜禽，既可更充分利用自然资源，减轻粮食压力，又可以向市场提供更多样的肉食，生产者和消费者都会获益。
    调整产业、作物结构，应当作为农村深化改革的一个方面，需要有一系列配套的政策措施，好在前几年已有这方面的经验，做好工作，把农牧民的积极性调动起来，自觉自愿地实现这一转移，并不是很困难的。
