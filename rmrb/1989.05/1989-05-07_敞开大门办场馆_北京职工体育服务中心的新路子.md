	Open the Doors to Operate the Stadium
	— The New Approach of the Beijing Workers' Sports Service Center
	By Huang Zhenzhong, Reporter of this Newspaper

	On May 1, Beijing Workers' Stadium was renamed Beijing Workers' Sports Service Center and opened its doors to the public.

		Firmly Open the Doors

	Sports venues should ideally be open all day, but the original Beijing Workers' Stadium was often closed. A statistic reveals the problem: in the past, the stadium only held 40 matches per year, and the gymnasium slightly more, at 120 matches. Soviet sports officials, upon visiting the stadium, were baffled by the quiet scene. They said, "In the Soviet Union, sports venues operate from morning till night, with continuous activities." Beijing's youth also found it puzzling, wondering why the coveted green field was barred from them by a fence. Middle and elementary school students, unable to find a place to play, would occasionally jump over the fence to kick a ball. Meanwhile, the workers inside spent much of their time patrolling and cleaning. This abnormal situation persisted for over 20 years, and many people had grown accustomed to it. Last year, the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held elections, producing a new leadership team. The leadership of the Beijing Workers' Stadium also changed hands. Soon after, the stadium established a reform group to conduct investigations and research, and formulate plans. The stadium director first proposed the idea of opening the doors to operate the stadium, welcoming sports-loving workers and youth to engage in activities, utilizing various sports facilities and equipment.

		Developing Towards Multi-functionality

	Beijing Workers' Stadium was built in 1959, with a construction area of 80,000 square meters. Whether in terms of location or facilities, it is excellent and can fully develop towards multi-functionality, meeting the various cultural needs of the masses. Now, they have decided to open up in all directions and organize activities in sections. The Workers' Sports Service Center is divided into four main areas: the stadium, gymnasium, swimming and roller-skating rink, and Jidu Hotel, gradually forming a comprehensive service system that integrates sports, arts, entertainment, commerce, and tourism, becoming the largest public sports venue in Beijing with the most activities. Currently, all 700 employees of the stadium are busy with this endeavor, and various tasks are underway.

		Ending the "Iron Rice Bowl" and Not Eating "Imperial Rations"

	The original Beijing Workers' Stadium had relied on state subsidies for 20 years. In their words, they had a "golden rice bowl" but still begged for food from the state. After the new leadership team was established, they boldly proposed that in the future, they would not only stop relying on subsidies but also increase revenue, using the earnings to supplement sports facilities. This is not an arbitrary idea but is backed by solid measures. They first ensured no waste. In the past, the entire stadium operated on a collective system, and just the water bill alone resulted in nearly 200,000 yuan in fines from the state each year. Now, with section-based management, this can save a significant amount of funds. Due to the development towards multi-functionality, there are more avenues for revenue, such as entertainment, tennis, roller-skating, and inviting celebrities, which should be achievable. Many sports venues have long dreamed of breaking through this difficult barrier, and here, it is expected to be overcome.

	Of course, they still face many difficulties that are hard to solve immediately, but as long as they persist in reform, a bright future is sure to come.

### 敞开大门办场馆——北京职工体育服务中心的新路子

　　敞开大门办场馆   
    ——北京职工体育服务中心的新路子
    本报记者  黄振中
    ５月１日，北京工人体育场更名为北京职工体育服务中心，并向社会敞开大门。
    　　　　坚决打开大门
    体育场馆本来应该是全天候开放，可是原来北京工人体育场却是经常大门紧闭。有个统计数字很能说明问题，过去平均一年体育场只进行４０场比赛，体育馆稍多一些，也仅１２０场。苏联国家体育官员参观工人体育场时，看到冷冷静静的场面感到不可理解。他们说，苏联的体育场馆一天从早至晚开放，体育活动不断。北京青少年对此也不理解，不知道那令人羡慕的绿茵场为何用一道栏杆把他们拒之门外。中小学生由于找不到活动场地，时不时越过栏杆进去踢球。而场里的职工却把许多时间用来巡逻和打扫卫生。这种反常的现象一直沿袭了２０多年，不少人也就不习以为常了。去年北京市总工会改选，产生了新的领导班子，其所属的北京工人体育场的领导也换了新人。不久，工人体育场成立了体改组，对全场的改革进行调查研究，制订方案。场主任首先提出了敞开大门办场馆的主张，把爱好体育的职工和青少年迎进门进行活动，利用各种体育设施和器材。
    　　　　向多功能发展
    北京工人体育场建成于１９５９年，建筑面积达８万平方米。无论是地理位置还是设施都很好，完全可以向多功能发展，满足群众各种文化生活的需要。现在他们决定全方位开放，分片组织活动。职工体育服务中心下设体育场、体育馆、游泳旱冰场和京都宾馆四大块，逐步形成体育、文艺、娱乐、商业、旅游为一体的综合服务系统，成为北京最大、活动项目最多的公共体育场。现在全场７００名职工都在为此而忙碌，各项工作正在展开。
    　　　　端金饭碗不吃“皇粮”
    原北京工人体育场曾吃过２０年国家补贴，用他们的话说，叫揣着金饭碗向国家要饭吃。新的领导班子成立后，他们大胆提出今后不仅不吃补贴，而且要多创收，用创收的钱增补体育设施。这不是盲目的设想，而是有扎实的措施。他们首先是做到不浪费，过去全场吃大锅饭，仅水费一项每年国家罚款就是近２０万元。现在分片管理，这一项就能节约不少经费。由于向多功能发展，创收的门路多，像娱乐、网球、滑旱冰等都可创收，请赵公元帅不成问题，应该说是可以做到以场养场、以馆养馆的。许多体育场馆多年梦想攻破的难关，在这里可望得到突破。
    当然，他们现在还有许多困难一时难以解决，但只要坚持改革下去，迎来的一定是光明的前景。
