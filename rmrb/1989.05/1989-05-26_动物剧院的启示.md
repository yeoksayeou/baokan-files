Tickets to the Moscow Animal Theater are notoriously hard to come by, requiring a month's advance booking. However, according to a friend, not seeing a performance here would be a lifelong regret. I am truly grateful to Miss Yelena from the Soviet Union's *Children's Literature* magazine, who managed to secure tickets in just three days. We repeatedly thanked her, and she laughed humorously, revealing that Director Dulova is a children's literature writer!

With just half an hour remaining until the show, Director Dulova still warmly received us. She is an artist honored with the title of People's Artist of the Soviet Union and participates in every performance to meet the audience's expectations. When we arrived, she was busy getting ready, already dressed in her silver-threaded performance costume, sparkling with jewels. Her office was equally opulent, resembling a treasure trove: elegant furniture, rare porcelain, beautiful bird and animal specimens, and artistic sculptures from around the world. She mentioned that she had performed in dozens of countries but had never been to China, expressing her hope to one day meet Chinese young audiences.

She enthusiastically introduced her great-grandfather, Dulov, whose lifelong efforts established this animal theater, which has been preserved since the October Revolution.

She said her great-grandfather Dulov was a man of many talents but unfortunately became an orphan at the age of five. Dulov's father was a soldier; his grandmother was Russia's first female officer and a trusted aide to General Kutuzov. She personally gave her *Cavalry Diary* to Pushkin, who treasured it. Many of Pushkin's works about cavalry life were inspired by this diary. Tolstoy also wrote about this female general. Therefore, Dulov dreamed of becoming a soldier like his grandmother and father. However, he fell in love with the circus. While performing in the circus, he also painted, played the piano, and wrote popular science articles. In 1911, he finally became a famous circus performer through diligent practice and was also a writer of popular science books. Because of his fame, he had a considerable income and was able to buy this house, which he then converted into an animal theater. Using animals to perform stories and inspire children with humor and joy was his innovation. He personally raised and trained the animals. He revolutionized the circus's animal training methods, developing various performance instincts based on animal psychology. For this, he established the Animal Psychology Research Institute in 1919. He had many friends, and his home was always filled with guests, including Yesenin, Mayakovsky, and the soloist Shalyapin, who were all frequent visitors. He treated animals with the same care as humans, and when animals died, he had them stuffed and displayed in the exhibition hall as a memorial. The exhibition hall downstairs has specimens of dogs, geese, cats, foxes, and bears, all looking very lovable. Dulov passed away in 1935, and the theater was managed by his wife. After his wife's death, his daughter Anna took over. In 1978, after his daughter's death, Dulova, who had just graduated from the Gorky Literary Institute, took on the responsibility. With her literary background and early exposure to animal training art, she quickly took on the role and won the Komsomol Prize, followed by the national title of People's Artist.

The performance was truly unique. Dulova's appearance on stage immediately captivated the audience. Her every move tightly gripped the young spectators. Accompanied by drumbeats, a white rooster flew onto the stage, flapping its wings and greeting the young audience, causing the entire hall to erupt in applause.

When a pair of white storks performed a dance, the stage's color scheme changed, evoking the vastness of the plains. Round lights, like a full moon reflected in water, highlighted the three gracefully dancing white storks, transporting the audience into a poetic realm. Soon, a kangaroo and a wolfdog competed in pole vaulting. Seeing the wolfdog's triumphant leap and the kangaroo's disappointed expression after two failures, the theater filled with cheers and laughter, sending the young audience into a new wave of joy...

The animal theater has two stages, one for large animals and one for small animals. The small animal stage is specifically for preschool children. That day, the small animal stage's performance featured a group of white mice taking a train. The title was *On Earth, There Are Not Only Humans but Also Animals*. The story revolved around animals in a deep mountain suddenly losing the sun and yearning for light. The entire performance lasted less than half an hour, but the young audience was very satisfied. Even after leaving the theater, their laughter, admiration, and regret for the lazy little mouse that missed the train still echoed. For a moment, I too became a child, filled with childlike joy. I thought that these young audience members, when they grow up, will surely cherish the memories of this afternoon. They will have a deep affection for their childhood, which will lead them to love others and everything in the world!

　　动物剧院的启示
    王一地
    莫斯科动物剧院的门票很不容易买到，得一个月前定购呢。不过据朋友介绍说，不看这家剧院的演出，会是一生的遗憾。真感谢苏联《儿童文学》杂志社的叶琳娜小姐，她居然三天内就买到了。我们频频向她道谢，她幽默地直笑，原来杜洛娃院长是儿童文学作家！
    离演出仅剩半小时，杜洛娃院长也还热情地接待了我们。她是获得苏联人民演员光荣称号的艺术家，为不负观众期望，还场场参加演出。我们来到时，她正忙着化妆，已经穿上了银线绣织的演出服，通身珠光宝气。她的办公室也富丽堂皇，简直就是琳琅满目的珍宝馆：高贵的家具，稀有的瓷器，美丽的飞禽走兽标本，世界各地的艺术雕刻……她说她到过几十个国家去演出，但没去过中国，期望有一天能同中国的小观众相见。
    她兴致勃勃地介绍她的外祖公杜洛夫，这座动物剧院也就是她外祖公奋斗一生创下的基业，十月革命后一直保持了下来。
    她说她外祖公杜洛夫多才多艺，但很不幸，五岁就成了孤儿。杜洛夫的父亲是军人；外祖母是俄国第一个女军官，是名将库茨涅佐夫的得力助手，她的《骑兵日记》后来亲手送给了普希金，普希金视为珍宝。普希金许多写骑兵生活的作品素材大都来源于这本日记。托尔斯泰的作品里，也写到过这位女将军。因此，杜洛夫从小也梦想当一位像外祖母、像父亲一样的军人。但他却又爱上了马戏团。他一边当马戏团演员，一边画油画、弹钢琴，写科普知识文章。１９１１年他终于靠勤学苦练成了著名的马戏团演员，而且又是科普读物作家。因为有名，也就有了可观的收入，也就能够买下这处住宅，然后根据自己的愿望又把这所住宅改建成动物剧场。用动物表演剧情使孩子们从幽默和快乐中受到人生启发，是他的首创。他自己喂养动物，训练动物。他革新了马戏团的驯兽方法，根据动物心理，驯练出多种演出本能，为此１９１９年又成立了动物心理研究机构。他交游广泛，家里宾客不断，叶赛宁、马雅可夫斯基、独唱演员沙拉宾等等，都是家里的常客。他像对待人一样的爱护动物，动物老死就做成标本放在陈列室里，以作纪念，楼下陈列室里有狗、鹅、猫、狐、熊等的标本，形象都十分可爱。１９３５年杜洛夫逝世，剧场由夫人管理，夫人去世后由女儿安娜管。１９７８年女儿去世，杜洛娃正好由高尔基文学院毕业，担子落在了她的肩上。以她的文学素养，加上从小受到的驯兽艺术熏陶，很快使她胜任了这个职务，并获得共青团奖金，之后又获国家级人民演员称号。
    演出真是别开生面。杜洛娃一出场就满堂生辉，她的一言一动都紧紧吸引着小观众。随着鼓声，一只白鸡飞上台，拍着翅儿向小观众叫唤着表示欢迎，全场一下子掌声雷动。
    一对白鹳表演舞蹈时，舞台上色调为之一变，出现了广袤原野的情调，圆圆的灯光，似一轮明月映在水中，衬托得三只翩翩飞舞的白鹳，仙姿动人，把观众带进美妙的诗境。一会儿又是袋鼠和狼狗比赛跳竿，看到狼狗一跳而过那种盛气凌人的架式，袋鼠两次失败的失意神态，剧场上响起鼓励、嘲笑的叫声，小观众们又进入新的欢乐的高潮……
    动物剧场又分大动物和小动物两个舞台，小动物剧场是专供学龄前孩子观赏的。那天小动物剧场的演出是一群小白鼠坐火车。剧名叫《在地球上生活的不光有人也有动物》，故事大意是在一个深山里，突然失去了太阳，动物们都希求光明。整个演出不到半小时，小观众们却十分满足。直到走出剧场，耳边仍然回荡着他们的欢笑声，赞叹声和为那只由于懒散而没上去火车急得乱窜的小白鼠的惋惜声。一刹间我自己也变成了孩子，我心里也充满了一种童稚的乐趣。我想这些小观众们长大以后，每当想起这个下午必定还会依恋不已。对童年的生活充满一种由衷的爱恋，进而又去爱恋别人，爱恋世间的一切！
