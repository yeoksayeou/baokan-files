Title: Leaders Should Interfere Less in Personal Matters

Recently, I encountered a situation where a cadre was going through a divorce due to a breakdown in his marriage. The matter was brought to the attention of the relevant leaders, who took it very seriously and made efforts to mediate. However, because the couple had deep-seated grievances and a wide rift, reconciliation was difficult. Thus, they intended to resolve the issue through legal means. However, the "relevant leaders" refused to issue the necessary documentation, forcing the cadre to repeatedly appeal to higher-level leaders for support.

Upon hearing this, my first reaction was: are our "relevant leaders" interfering too much? The organization caring for individuals and superiors caring for subordinates is undoubtedly correct. However, when it comes to personal matters, especially those that have become civil disputes and need to be resolved through law, leaders should not intervene forcibly. We emphasize legal systems and the rule of law, and in situations that have clearly involved the law, why not resort to legal means? This may be related to the weak legal awareness of some of our leaders.

In our society, where the legal system has long been imperfect, people have become accustomed to using administrative means to interfere in all matters, including personal affairs. In their minds, there is also the notion that "going to court" is not honorable. It seems that once involved in a lawsuit, whether justified or not, one has a problem, and people will look at you differently. For a unit, if there is a lawsuit, someone will blame the unit for not doing a good job, and the leaders will lose face. I think these are all prejudices that do not align with strengthening legal awareness and building a legal society.

The emergence of this phenomenon, of course, also has historical roots. Looking back, during the revolutionary war years, the older generation of revolutionaries was busy fighting and had no time or conditions to talk about love. Thus, many couples were matched by leaders. It should be said that most of these marriages were harmonious, but there were indeed some who did not get along well, even to the point of divorce. When such situations arose, leaders often intervened, using every means to persuade them to stay together for the "revolution." The result of organizational and leadership intervention was that some ended happily, but it should be said that there were also tragic outcomes, with some people even suffering for a lifetime.

Today, the times have completely changed, and people's thoughts and ideas have undergone significant changes. Then, should the thoughts and actions of some of our leaders also be updated? I think that relevant organizations and leaders should care for everyone, but they should not interfere too much and certainly should not take over.

A few thoughts, I wonder if they are appropriate?

　　领导应当少干预个人私事
    阳实
    最近碰到这样一件事：有个干部因与妻子感情破裂而闹离婚。事情反映到有关领导那里，领导十分重视，努力做了调解工作。但是，由于二人积怨甚久，裂痕甚深，实在难以和好，于是，意欲诉诸法律解决。可是，“有关领导”硬是不给开证明，使得这位干部只好多次越级找上级领导反映，求得支持。
    听了此事，我心里第一个反映就是：我们的“有关领导”是不是干预得太多、太过。组织关心个人，上级关心下级，这无疑是对的，可是，涉及个人私事，特别是已成为民事纠纷的事，需要由法律来解决的时候，领导仍然要强行干预，就欠妥当了。我们强调法制，强调依法办事，在确实已经涉法的情况下，为什么却不让诉诸法律呢？这恐怕与我们某些领导法制观念淡薄有很大关系。
    在咱们这个法制长期不健全的社会，人们习惯了用行政手段干预一切事务，包括个人的私事。在思想上也形成了“打官司”不光彩的观念。似乎一沾上“打官司”，不管有理没理就是出了问题，人们也就会用另样的眼光看你。对一个单位来说，出了“打官司”的事，有人就会指责这个单位工作没做好，领导人脸上也无光。我觉得，这都是世俗的偏见，是与加强法制观念，建设法制社会不相符合的。
    产生这种现象，当然也有历史的渊源。想过去，在革命战争年代，老一代的革命者，忙于打仗，顾不上也没条件谈恋爱，于是，由领导撮合而成的夫妻相当多。应当说，其中大多数还是琴瑟和谐的，不过也确有少数感情上不大合得来，甚至闹离婚。遇到这种情况，常有领导做工作，千方百计地劝他们为“革命”结合下去。这种组织出面、领导出面干预的结果，确有一些导致了喜剧的结局，但是，应当说，其中确实也不乏悲剧结局，有的人甚至为此而痛苦一辈子。
    今天，时代已经完全不同，人们的思想观念也发生了很大的变化。那末，我们某些领导的思想和做法，是否也该更新一下呢？我以为，有关组织和领导应当关心每一个人，但是，决不能干预过多，更不可包办代替。
    一点感想，不知然否？
