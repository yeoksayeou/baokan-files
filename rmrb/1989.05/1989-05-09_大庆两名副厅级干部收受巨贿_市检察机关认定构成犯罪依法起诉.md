The People's Daily has learned from the Supreme People's Procuratorate that the case of two deputy-ministerial level leaders of the Daqing Petrochemical Company accepting bribes has been investigated and concluded by the Daqing Municipal Procuratorate, which decided yesterday to file a lawsuit with the judicial authorities. This is one of the two cases out of the eight currently investigated and prosecuted cases of ministerial-level economic crimes nationwide.

According to reports, Guan Wenbin and Li Kexiang abused their authority to approve petrochemical raw materials, accepting large bribes in exchange for providing these materials. The Daqing Municipal People's Procuratorate has investigated and determined that both have committed the crime of accepting bribes.

Guan Wenbin, who formerly served as the deputy director of the Daqing Petrochemical Company, directed the company's labor service company manager to provide chemical raw materials totaling over 800 tons to a company in Tai'an, Shandong, and the Dragon Phoenix Hotel in Daqing in May and June of last year, accepting bribes totaling 270,000 yuan.

Li Kexiang, currently the manager of the Daqing Petrochemical Company's Industrial Development Company, also formerly served as the deputy director of the Petrochemical Company. From April to June of last year, he approved the sale of over 2,000 tons of chemical raw materials, accepting bribes totaling 120,000 yuan as well as cigarettes and alcohol.
