Author: Qingzhu
Date: 1989-05-03
Edition: 4

The Chinese translation of American author Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" trilogy has recently been included in the third volume of the "Nobel Literature Prize Winners Series" and published by Lijiang Publishing House. This 700,000-word novel is divided into three parts: "The Good Earth," "Sons," and "A House Divided." It depicts the lives of three generations of the Wang family, Chinese farmers, and presents a rich tapestry of social life in old China. In 1938, Pearl S. Buck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature for this work. Since then, this book has sparked considerable debate in China's intellectual circles. For various reasons, the general public has long been unable to access the original work. This time, eight Chinese translators, both young and middle-aged, have collaborated to translate the entire text, providing a more comprehensive resource for a re-evaluation of this famous American female writer.
