Thousands of Tibetan monks and laypeople flocked to Tashilhunpo Monastery this morning to pay their respects and worship the remains and relics of the Panchen Lama.

Tashilhunpo Monastery, one of the four great monasteries in Tibet, had all its main halls lit with thousands of butter lamps today. The "Zejia Hall," where the Panchen Lama's remains are placed, was filled with various offerings, merit water, butter lamps, and khatas. Eight senior monks were chanting scriptures and praying.

To preserve the Panchen Lama's remains, since his passing, his remains have been covered with yellow satin until they were properly handled and moved to Tashilhunpo Monastery. Today, the faithful saw the Panchen Lama's remains for the first time, adorned with gold powder. People holding khatas entered the hall one by one, bowing to offer their respects.

According to a responsible person from the Tashilhunpo Monastery Democratic Management Committee, the activity of paying respects to the Panchen Lama's remains will continue until the completion of the stupa for the 10th Panchen Lama.

    新华社日喀则５月２７日电  （记者央珍、中央人民广播电台记者索朗）今天清晨，数以千计的藏族僧俗群众涌向札什伦布寺，瞻仰与朝拜班禅大师法体与法容。
    西藏四大名寺之一的札什伦布寺，各主要经堂今天都点燃起千盏供灯。安放班禅大师法体的“则甲大厅”内摆满了各种供品、功德水、酥油灯和哈达，８名高僧在诵经祈祷。
    为保护好班禅大师遗体，从大师圆寂以来其法体一直用黄缎覆盖着，直至处理好后移至札什伦布寺。今天信徒们第一次目睹了刷了金粉后的班禅大师法容。手捧哈达的人们依次进入大厅，躬身向法体敬献。
