Troops stationed at Beijing Railway Station have launched a "Three Loves" education campaign, presenting themselves as a "civilized army" and winning the understanding and support of the masses.

In recent days, this unit has extensively carried out activities to "love the capital, love the people of the capital, and love the youth and students." They organized soldiers to clean up the environment, assist the elderly and children, guide passengers, and provide medical treatment for the public. They have dispatched over 6,000 personnel to clean the platforms, tracks, and warehouses, removing 85 tons of garbage. They have also rushed to deliver backlogged mail and newspapers totaling over 20,000 items, treated over 300 students and residents, and dispatched 200 personnel to maintain order at the station.

The masses have not only shown understanding but also actively supported the troops. The station has vacated two large warehouses for the troops to stay in; food and water supplies have been ensured; bathwater has been provided, and personnel have been sent to spray water to cool down the vehicles where the troops are staying.

The soldiers are deeply moved and say, "The people are so good to us, we must not do anything to disappoint them."

    驻北京车站戒严部队
    开展“三热爱”活动
    新华社北京5月30日电  驻北京火车站的某戒严部队开展“三热爱”教育，以“文明之师”的形象，赢得了群众的理解和支持。
    近日来，这支部队广泛开展了“热爱首都、热爱首都人民、热爱青年学生”的活动，组织干部战士清理卫生，扶老携幼，疏导旅客，为群众治病。他们先后出动6000余人次，清理站台、道轨、仓库，清除垃圾85吨。还抢运积压邮件、报纸2万余件，为学生、群众治病300多人次，并派出200人在车站维持秩序。
    群众由谅解进而积极支援部队。车站腾出两间大仓库供部队住宿；吃饭、饮水也给予了保障；还为部队烧了洗澡水，派人为部队居住的车辆洒水降温。
    官兵们感动地说：“人民群众对我们这么好，我们绝不能做愧对人民的事。”
