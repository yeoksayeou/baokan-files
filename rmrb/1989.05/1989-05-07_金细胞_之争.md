Recently, the American media has been abuzz with reports about a patent for a cell known as the "Mo" cell, making it a hot topic. This cell was extracted from a leukemia patient and is said to produce a large amount of protein (CM-CSF), which promotes the growth of human lymphatic cells and significantly enhances the body's immune system. Currently, a pharmaceutical company's genetics research institute in Massachusetts is studying the mass production of this cell. If the research progresses smoothly, humanity may open new avenues for treating cancer and AIDS. Several months ago, Professor Golde of the University of California, Los Angeles, who discovered this cell, claimed in an article that this discovery could have a revolutionary impact similar to the discovery of antibiotics. This cell has thus earned the nickname "golden cell," and the leukemia patient, John Moore, has become known as the "man with the golden cell."

However, this discovery has sparked a legal battle. The background of the dispute is as follows: Initially, Moore was unaware that he had such a valuable cell in his body, and Dr. Golde, who had been treating him for years, never disclosed the truth. During a blood draw, Moore accidentally overheard a nurse mentioning that he had such a "treasure" in his body. He then demanded to share the rights to his own cells. However, as early as 1984, Dr. Golde had applied for and obtained the patent for the "Mo" cell and refused to grant Moore's request. Moore then sought legal representation and filed a lawsuit in court.

The judge ruled that Dr. Golde's actions in the research could not be considered "selfless." According to materials obtained by Moore's lawyer, Dr. Golde had already received $1.5 million in stock from the Massachusetts pharmaceutical company. Dr. Golde, however, insisted that the research was not for profit and that he had served as a consultant for the company for seven years, with the stock being his compensation.

Currently, both sides are at an impasse. Moore is determined to pursue the matter. The dispute over the ownership of the "golden cell" will continue.

### “金细胞”之争

　　“金细胞”之争
    最近，美国舆论界对一个被称为“Ｍｏ”细胞的专利权竞相报道，一时间成了个热门话题。
    这个细胞是从一白血病患者身上提取出来的，据说它能够生成一种数量很多的蛋白质（ＣＭ—ＣＳＦ），促进人体淋巴细胞增长，从而大大提高人体自身的免疫力。目前，美国麻省一家医药公司的遗传研究所正在研究批量繁殖这种细胞。如果进展顺利，人类将能在医治癌症和艾滋病方面开辟新的途径。数月前，发现这种细胞的美国加州大学医学院戈尔德教授在一篇文章中宣称，这一发现将可能与“抗生素的发现具有同样的革命性”。这个细胞因此赢得了“金细胞”的美称，那个白血病患者约翰·穆尔也就成了“带金细胞的人”。
    但是，这个发现却招来了一场官司。事情的原委是，穆尔起初不知道自己身上有如此宝贵的细胞，而多年来一直为他治病的戈尔德教授也没有对他说过实情。在一次抽血时，穆尔偶尔从护士那里听到自己身上竟有这样的“宝贝”。于是，他提出，要求分享对自己细胞的拥有权。然而早在一九八四年戈尔德教授已申请到了对“Ｍｏ”细胞的专利权，他不肯答应穆尔的要求。穆尔找到了律师，并上告法院。
    法官认为，戈尔德教授在研究中的表现不能认为是“无私的”。因为，根据穆尔的律师掌握的材料，戈尔德教授已经得到了麻省那家医药公司以股份形式付给他的一百五十万美元。戈尔德本人则坚持说，搞这项研究不是为赚钱，他任该公司的顾问已达七年之久，所得的股份是对他的酬劳。
    现在，双方争持不下。穆尔决心穷追不舍。有关“金细胞”的归属问题还要争执下去。
