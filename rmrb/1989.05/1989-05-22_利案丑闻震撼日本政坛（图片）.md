The Recruit Scandal Shocks Japanese Politics

Under the impact of the "Recruit" scandal, Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru finally announced on April 25 that he would resign in taking responsibility.

Recruit is a large company engaged in advertising, information, real estate, and tourism. A few years ago, it began transferring unlisted shares of its subsidiaries to its "insiders," thus constituting the largest and most widespread case of bribery and corruption since the end of World War II in Japan. Many government departments and political parties were directly implicated in this case, involving 76 prominent figures from various circles. So far, several political figures have resigned, and more than a dozen have been arrested by the Tokyo District Prosecutors Office.

The Recruit scandal caused Japanese public support for the Takeshita cabinet to drop to a low of 3.9%.

Last summer, after the "Recruit" case was exposed, Recruit Company made "post-event arrangements" by giving multiple politicians a total of 40 million yen (half of which was returned). This is a scene captured by Japanese reporters using a hidden camera on September 2, 1988, where Recruit Cosmos Company personnel (left) gave Diet member Nakazaki Yanosuke a "hush money" to prevent him from raising unfavorable questions in the Diet. However, two days later, Nakazaki Yanosuke exposed the incident.

Japanese citizens held rallies demanding a thorough investigation of the Recruit scandal.

Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru announced his resignation on April 25.

Former Minister of Finance Miyazawa Kiichi resigned on December 9, 1988.

Recruit Company's former chairman, Ebisawa Hiroshi, was arrested on February 13.

Takeshita Noboru's former secretary, Aoki Ippei, committed suicide on April 26.

    利案丑闻震撼日本政坛
    在“利库路特”丑闻的冲击下，日本首相竹下登终于在4月25日宣布将引咎辞职。
    “利库路特”公司是一家经营广告、信息、地产和旅游业的大型企业。几年前，它开始将其子公司的未上市股票转让给自己的“关系户”，从而构成日本战后金额最大、涉及面最广的行贿受贿案。直接受此案牵连的有许多政府部门和政党，涉嫌的各界要人达76人。迄今已有数名政界要人辞职，十几人被东京地方检察当局逮捕。

    去年夏天“利”案曝光后，“利库路特”公司为做“善后工作”又给多名政治家送去合计4000万日元（半数被退回）。这是日本记者通过隐藏的照相机拍摄到去年9月2日“利库路特宇宙”公司人员（左）向国会议员楢崎弥之助赠送“堵嘴费”的情景，企图以此阻止他在国会提出不利于他们的质询。可是两天之后，楢崎弥之助将此事揭露了出来。
