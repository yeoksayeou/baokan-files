In 1987, the feature film "Blood Battle of Taierzhuang" won the Excellent Film Award from the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, the 10th Hundred Flowers Award for Best Feature Film, and was nominated for the 7th Golden Rooster Award for Best Feature Film. The film's co-director, Zhai Junjie, was also nominated for the Golden Rooster Award for Best Supporting Actor for his outstanding portrayal of the Sichuan Army General Wang Mingzhang. Faced with these honors, Zhai Junjie seemed to have little interest, but instead, along with his friend and screenwriter Tian Junli, he headed to the banks of the Jinsha River to the Panzhihua Iron and Steel Company.

Seven months later, they completed the script for the film "The Republic Will Not Forget." After another year, this film, directed and starring Zhai Junjie, was completed. Upon its trial screening, it immediately garnered widespread attention.

"The Republic Will Not Forget" broke a "cold trend." The film, set in a major Chinese steel enterprise, passionately sings the praises of those who made sacrifices during the reform. In the current climate where commercial films are prevalent, this might seem somewhat "out of touch." However, it is precisely because of this that it stands out as particularly valuable. Critics have noted that the film's direction is impressive, and they have praised Zhai Junjie's portrayal of the general manager of Huagang Company, Tian Gong, as a new and vibrant character on the silver screen.

Zhai Junjie said, "After entering the ten-mile steel city, I felt a strong sense of national spirit and cohesion there, which is something you can't experience by staying in a small circle. I feel a responsibility to express the joys and sorrows of the Panzhihua people through art and to inspire my fellow countrymen to strive and advance!"

The subject matter of "The Republic Will Not Forget" is hard and cold, so how does it attract audiences? Zhai Junjie answered, "Focus on two points: carefully crafting characters and working hard to find the intersection of serious drama and entertainment."

Zhai Junjie's portrayal of the industrialist Tian Gong is indeed vivid and lively. Compared to the series of entrepreneurs and reformers already seen on screen, Tian Gong is unique, a living individual with a distinct personality. He is neither exaggerated nor deliberately deep; his laughter, anger, sorrow, and joy are all part of his character. Through highly naturalistic acting, Zhai Junjie effortlessly brings this man, who is both fierce and spirited, yet also cunning and vulgar; both meticulous and decisive; both commanding and full of emotions, to life as the boss of a steel company. The film treats topics like reform plans and production processes as background, focusing solely on the people—those in the 1980s' large enterprises. With thick brushstrokes, it reveals the complex emotions and changes of Tian Gong and his partners, subordinates, wife, and daughters, thus presenting a colorful picture of real life.

Zhai Junjie wrote in his diary: "I am a weak person, but I hope to become a strong one. If one day I become strong, I will never forget that I was once weak."

　　把钢铁豪情写在胶片上    
    ——记影片《共和国不会忘记》编导、主演翟俊杰
    常青
    １９８７年，故事片《血战台儿庄》获得了广播电影电视部颁发的优秀影片奖、第十届百花奖最佳故事片奖和第七届金鸡奖最佳故事片提名，该片导演之一翟俊杰也因在影片中出色地饰演了川军师长王铭章一角而获得了金鸡奖最佳男配角提名。面对一串殊荣，翟俊杰似乎并无更多的兴趣，却和他的好友、编剧田军利一头扎到金沙江畔的攀枝花钢铁公司去了。
    七个月之后，他们哥俩合作编写的电影剧本《共和国不会忘记》印出了定稿本。又过了整整一年，这部由翟俊杰执导并主演的电影摄制完成了，一经试映，立刻受到广泛的重视。
    《共和国不会忘记》爆了一个“冷门”。影片以我国大型钢铁企业为题材，热情讴歌了在改革中作出奉献的人们。这在当前商业片一拥而上的情势下，大概是不太“入流”的。但正由于此，它才愈发显得难能可贵。评论界认为，该片在导演处理上颇有气势，更对翟俊杰塑造的华钢公司总经理田耕热情肯定，认为是我国近年来银幕上出现的一个崭新的人物形象。
    翟俊杰说，我和小田钻进十里钢城之后，强烈地感受到那里有一股子昂扬的民族精神和凝聚力，这是伫足在小圈圈里所无法体验得到的。我觉得有责任把攀钢人的酸甜苦辣通过艺术表现出来，激励同胞们拚搏、奋进！
    《共和国不会忘记》的题材硬梆梆冷冰冰的，是怎样使它对观众具有吸引力呢？翟俊杰这样回答：“咬住两点使劲抡！一是精心刻画人物，二是下功夫寻找正剧和观赏性、娱乐性之间的交汇点。”
    翟俊杰塑造的大企业家田耕的形象的确是相当生动鲜活的。与银幕或屏幕上已有的一系列企业家、改革者形象相比，田耕是不落套的“这一个”，一个具有独特个性的大活人。他既没被拔高，也不故作深沉状；嬉笑怒骂，愁苦忧伤，皆成文章。翟俊杰通过十分生活化的表演，挥洒自如地使这个既有虎气豪气，又有猴气俗气；既精明细致，又决断专横；既能叱咤风云，又有七情六欲的钢铁公司的大老板真实可信地站到了观众面前。影片把诸如改革方案、生产流程等等都作为背景处理，唯独紧紧抓住人——８０年代大企业里的人，以浓重的笔触揭示出田耕和他的伙伴、部下、妻女的复杂心态及其变化，从而为我们展现了一幅多姿多彩的现实生活画卷。
    翟俊杰在日记里写下这样一段话：“我是个弱者，但我期望成为一个强者。假如有一天我能成为强者，我也绝不会忘记我曾经是一个弱者。”
