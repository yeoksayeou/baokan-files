Recent Solar Activity Intensifies

    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw (Reporter Dong Fuseng) The Polish Academy of Sciences' Space Research Center recently observed that solar activity has significantly increased over the past few days. More active centers are forming, solar spots are expanding, and there are increasingly strong flashes.

    The research center stated that on May 23, there were two quite intense solar flares and one proton event. The proton flow released into space may reach the Earth's surface, resulting in geomagnetic storms and interference with radio communications.

    The sun is approaching the peak of its 11-year activity cycle. It is predicted that this peak will occur next year. Preliminary estimates suggest that this peak will be one of the strongest in recent decades.

　　近期太阳活动增强
    新华社华沙电  （记者董福生）波兰科学院宇宙研究中心最近观察发现，近几天太阳上的活动明显增强，正在形成越来越多的活跃中心，太阳黑子群在不断扩大，并出现日益增强的闪光。
    该研究中心说，５月２３日曾发生２次相当强烈的日暴和一次质子暴。向宇宙空间射出的质子流，可能抵达地球表面，其结果是引起磁暴，从而使无线电通讯受到干扰。
    太阳正日益接近自己１１年活跃周期中的高峰期。预计这一高峰期将在明年到来。据初步推测，这次高峰期将是近几十年来最强烈的一次。
