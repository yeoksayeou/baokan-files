The Liaoning Provincial Supervision Bureau analyzed 737 cases of misconduct investigated and handled in 1988 and found that the problem of officials' misconduct is quite serious, with five major characteristics.

First, corruption cases such as embezzlement and bribery are prominent, and the economic losses caused by dereliction of duty are enormous. Among the types of misconduct cases investigated and handled in the province last year, cases of embezzlement, bribery, abuse of power for personal gain, extravagance, and waste, collectively referred to as corrupt behavior, were prominent, totaling 333 cases, accounting for 45.1% of the total number of cases investigated last year. Serious bureaucratism and dereliction of duty cases totaled 112, accounting for 15% of the total number of cases investigated. The economic losses caused by these types of cases are enormous. In Dandong, the amount of misconduct in cases of officials' embezzlement, bribery, violation of financial discipline, and dereliction of duty last year was 250.9 million yuan, of which 7 cases of dereliction of duty and negligence caused economic losses of 230.1 million yuan, accounting for 91.7% of the total amount of officials' misconduct.

Second, misconduct by officials often occurs in supervisory and law enforcement departments and units that manage projects, quotas, funds, and materials. Last year, Dalian City investigated and handled 114 cases of misconduct, of which 41 cases occurred in public security, taxation, industry and commerce, and technical supervision departments, accounting for 36% of the total number of cases investigated in the city. A large number of misconduct cases in these departments involve the use of power to engage in embezzlement, extortion, and blackmail, which have a very bad impact. Some units that manage projects, quotas, funds, and materials have a relatively high incidence of cases, totaling 26 cases, accounting for 23% of the total number of cases investigated.

Third, the misconduct rate of leading officials and middle-aged officials is high. Last year, the province investigated and handled 737 officials, of which the proportion of misconduct by leading officials was relatively high. According to statistics, in Liaoyang City, 74% of the cases involved leading officials, in Jinzhou City, 63%, in Fushun City, 64%, in Tieling City, 60.8%, in Fuxin City, 72.7%, and in Benxi City, 73%. The proportion in several other cities is roughly the same. In terms of the age of misconduct, middle-aged officials are the majority.

Fourth, the essence of officials' corrupt behavior is mainly the exchange of power for money. Last year, the province investigated and handled 365 economic misconduct cases. Among these cases, 242 cases involved the use of power as a bargaining chip to extort money from units and individuals with requests, accounting for 66.3% of all economic cases. Although these corrupt behaviors have different forms of expression, they all have a common characteristic: some officials with power exchange money and goods for power, enrich themselves, and harm state and collective interests.

Fifth, the methods of misconduct are becoming more hidden and complex. Currently, the methods of officials' misconduct are numerous, and the characteristics are becoming more hidden and complex. First, those who engage in misconduct to enrich themselves often do so in a one-on-one manner in secret, with the source of the money being diverse and without leaving any records, making it difficult to investigate and gather evidence. Second, they take advantage of policy loopholes to give misconduct a "legal" disguise. Third, they collude with local individual business owners, peddlers, and roaming individuals, using each other to seek personal gain, and these individual business owners, peddlers, and roaming individuals are generally hard to track down. Fourth, there is collective misconduct within units. This type of collective misconduct within units does not appear to involve individuals enriching themselves, but in reality, it takes the form of bonuses, goods, and subsidies returned to individuals, achieving the goal of personal gain.

　　政府工作人员违纪五大特点
    辽宁省监察厅对１９８８年全省立案查处的７３７起违纪案件进行剖析发现，目前干部违纪问题比较严重，有五大特点。
    一、贪污受贿等腐败案件突出，渎职失职造成的经济损失惊人。去年全省立案查处的违纪案件类型中，以贪污受贿、以权谋私、奢侈浪费等通称为腐败行为类型的案件突出，共３３３件，占全年立案案件总数的４５．１％。严重官僚主义和渎职、失职案件，共查处１１２件，占立案总数的１５％。此类案件造成的经济损失是惊人的。丹东去年干部贪污受贿、违反财经纪律、渎失职案件的违纪金额是２５０．９万元，其中渎职和失职案件７起就造成经济损失２３０．１万元，占全部干部违纪金额的９１．７％。
    二、干部违纪多发生在监督执法部门和掌管项目、指标、资金、物资等实权单位。去年大连市立案查处违纪案件１１４件，其中公安、税务、工商和技术监督等监督执法部门有４１件，占全市立案总数的３６％。这些部门违纪大量的是利用手中权力进行贪污、索贿受贿和敲诈勒索，反应极坏。其中一些掌管项目、指标、资金、物资等实权单位发案率是较高的，共２６件，占立案总数的２３％。
    三、单位领导干部和中年干部违纪率高。去年全省共立案审查干部７３７名，其中，单位领导干部违纪所占比例较高。据统计，辽阳市占７４％，锦州市占６３％，抚顺市占６４％，铁岭市占６０．８％，阜新市占７２．７％，本溪市占７３％。其他几个市所占比例也大致相同。从违纪年龄上看中年干部违纪者居多。
    四、干部腐败行为的本质主要表现是权力与金钱的交易。去年全省查处干部违纪案件中，经济违纪案件有３６５件。在这些案件中，属于利用手中权力作筹码，向有所求单位和个人卡要财物的案件有２４２件，占全部经济案件的６６．３％。虽然这类案件表现形式各有所异，但纵观这些腐败行为都具有一个共同特征，即一些有权干部用权力换取钱物，中饱私囊，损害国家和集体利益。
    五、违纪手法日趋隐蔽复杂。目前干部违纪的手法很多，其特点是日趋隐蔽复杂。其一，凡是属于中饱私囊的多是采取一对一方式在暗地里进行，钱的出处名目繁多，并且不留下字据，给调查取证工作带来很大困难。其二，钻现行政策空子，给违纪披上“合法”外衣。其三，内外勾结。有的干部与地方个体户、商贩、流窜人员相互勾结，相互利用，从中谋私，而这些个体户、商贩、流窜人员一般行踪不定，很难查找。其四，单位集体违纪。这种单位集体违纪表面上没有个人中饱私囊，实际上采取以奖金、实物、补贴等形式返给个人，达到个人谋私的目的。
