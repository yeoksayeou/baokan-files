The agricultural technology departments should not exploit farmers

Susan is one of the poorest counties in our city, located in a remote mountainous area. The planned allocation of chemical fertilizers is already insufficient, and the county agricultural technology department takes advantage of its authority to withhold subsidized chemical fertilizers from farmers.

Last year, the agricultural technology station in this county charged a handling fee of 0.5 yuan for every 50 kilograms of ammonium bicarbonate tickets and 14 yuan for every 50 kilograms of urea tickets. This year, the situation remains the same. Even so, many farmers still cannot purchase the amount of chemical fertilizers allocated by the state. Where does the withheld chemical fertilizer go? Just at the beginning of this year, the Susan agricultural technology station bought 29 tons of ammonium bicarbonate from the supply and marketing cooperative and sold it to farmers at 300 yuan per ton, earning an extra profit of 43 yuan per ton, totaling 1,247 yuan; urea was sold at 650 yuan per ton, 112 yuan more than the state price per ton. The agricultural technology service company's Meishan retail department in this county displays more than 10 kinds of pesticides, with prices 30% higher than those sold by the supply and marketing cooperative. Farmers have strongly criticized this.

　　农技部门不应坑农民
    苏坂是我市的贫困乡之一，地处偏僻山区，计划内化肥本来就不足，发放肥料票的乡农技部门乘机利用职权，克扣农民的平价化肥。
    去年，这个乡农技站每５０公斤碳铵票收取手续费０．５元，每５０公斤尿素票收手续费１４元。今年依然如故。即使这样，许多农民仍买不到国家规定发放的化肥数量。克扣下来的化肥哪里去了呢？仅今年初，苏坂乡农技站从供销社买走碳铵２９吨，以每吨３００元的价格卖给农民，每吨高出国家定价４３元，获取额外利润１２４７元；尿素每吨卖６５０元，每吨高出国家牌价１１２元。这个乡农技服务公司美山门市部陈列的１０多种农药，价格高出供销社售价３０％，广大农民反映强烈。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　福建龙岩市供销社　张梅生
