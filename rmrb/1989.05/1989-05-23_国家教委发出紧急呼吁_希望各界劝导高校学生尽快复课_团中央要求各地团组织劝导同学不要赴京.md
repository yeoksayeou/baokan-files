The State Education Commission today issued an urgent appeal, hoping that all sectors of society will persuade college students to return to classes as soon as possible. The full text of the appeal is as follows:

Since mid-April, colleges and universities across the country, from Beijing to major cities, have seen students going on strike. Some schools have been forced to completely suspend classes, while others can only hold classes intermittently, making it impossible to maintain teaching order and ensure teaching quality. Now it is already late May, and the end of the semester is approaching. If this situation continues, the academic losses for students of all grades will be difficult to make up for. In particular, if the graduating students are to complete their studies according to the prescribed teaching requirements, they will inevitably have to delay their graduation. In addition, the time required for graduation allocation work will cause them to delay leaving school.

For a long time, the classrooms and dormitories of colleges and universities have been very tight, and many schools have been operating beyond their capacity. If a large number of graduates cannot leave on time, it will affect the enrollment work of 1989, making it impossible for the newly admitted students to start school on time. If a large number of students do not attend classes for a long time, even if they do not have a summer vacation, it will be difficult for them to completely make up for their studies. At the same time, in order to welcome new students, it will inevitably be necessary to reduce some of the enrollment tasks of colleges and universities. The teaching process of subsequent grades will also be greatly affected, bringing great difficulties to teaching arrangements. If this continues, not only will college students be harmed, but it will also involve all employing units, many high school graduates, and countless families. The consequences are serious and are something that everyone does not want to see.

The State Education Commission will work with colleges and universities to do everything possible to make up for the losses that have already been caused. However, the current situation has already gone beyond what colleges and universities and the education department can solve alone. Therefore, the State Education Commission, with a sense of concern and urgency, solemnly appeals to all sectors of society, especially the education sector, the media, and all student parents, to persuade students who have not yet returned to classes to resume classes immediately in various ways. We hope that people from all walks of life, with a sense of responsibility to the country and to young students, and with the spirit of considering their children, will give us their support.

Comrades of colleges and universities, the country and the people have high hopes for you and hope that you will become talents with both virtue and ability in the future. Your feelings of loving the country and caring about national affairs are understood by the Party and the government. You have expressed your opinions in various ways, and the Party and the government will seriously consider them. We sincerely hope that you will return to classes as soon as possible.

The Communist Youth League Central Committee today issued a notice, requiring local youth league organizations to assist the Party committees and relevant departments in doing a good job of persuading students who want to go to Beijing.

The notice said that in recent days, some students from various places have come to Beijing to support activities. This not only exacerbates the tension in railway transportation, disrupts normal traffic order, and increases the burden on various aspects of the capital, but also makes it difficult for students who enter Beijing to find food and accommodation, which is not conducive to the health of the students and does not help solve the current problems. Therefore, it is hoped that local youth league organizations will assist the Party committees and relevant departments in doing a good job of persuading students who want to go to Beijing, asking students not to come to Beijing, to communicate with the Party and the government, and to express their opinions through normal democratic procedures. We must protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of students and maintain the overall stability and unity.

　　国家教委发出紧急呼吁
    希望各界劝导高校学生尽快复课
    团中央要求各地团组织劝导同学不要赴京
    新华社北京５月２３日电  鉴于高等学校毕业分配和招收新生在即，国家教育委员会今天发出紧急呼吁，希望社会各界劝导高校学生尽快复课。呼吁书全文如下：
    ４月中旬以来，从北京到各大城市的高等学校，陆续发生了学生罢课的现象。有的学校被迫完全停课，有的学校只能断断续续地上课，教学秩序无法维持，教学质量难以保证。现在已到５月下旬，离学期结束越来越近了。这种状况如果继续下去，各年级学生课业的损失是难以弥补的。特别是应届毕业生如果要按规定的教学要求完成学业，就势必推迟毕业时间，再加上毕业分配工作所需的时间，他们就不得不推迟离校。
    长期以来，高等学校的教室、宿舍十分紧张，许多学校处于超负荷运转之中。如果大批毕业生不能按时离校，将影响到１９８９年的招生工作，使录取的新生无法按期入学。大批学生不上课的状况如再延续下去，即使暑假不放假，他们的学业也不容易完全弥补。同时为迎接新生，又势必被迫削减一些高校的招生任务。往后各年级的教学过程也将受到很大影响，会给教学安排带来极大的困难。这样发展下去，受损害的将不仅是高等学校的学生，而且要涉及所有用人单位、许多中等学校应届毕业生和千千万万个家庭，后果是严重的，是大家都不愿意看到的。
    国家教委将会同各高等学校尽一切努力来弥补已经造成的损失。但目前事态的发展，已经不是单靠高等学校和教育部门所能解决的。为此，国家教育委员会以忧虑、急迫的心情郑重地吁请社会各界，首先是教育界、新闻界以及所有的学生家长，以各种方式劝导没有复课的学生立即恢复上课。希望各界人士本着对国家负责、对青年学生负责，为子女着想的精神给我们以支持。
    广大的高等学校同学们，祖国和人民对你们寄予厚望，希望你们将来成为德才兼备的人才。你们热爱祖国、关心国家大事的心情，党和政府是理解的。你们已经用各种方式表达了你们的意见，党和政府是会认真考虑的。我们诚恳地希望你们尽快复课。
    　国家教育委员会　１９８９年５月２３日
    新华社北京５月２３日电　共青团中央今天发出通知，要求各地团组织协助党委和有关部门，做好要求赴京同学的劝导工作。
    通知说，近日来，一些地方的学生来北京搞声援活动，这不仅会加剧铁路运输的紧张状况，影响正常的交通秩序，增加首都各方面的负担，进入北京的同学食宿也发生困难，不利于同学们的身体健康，也无助于当前问题的解决。为此，希望各地共青团组织协助党委和有关部门做好要求赴京同学的劝导、说服工作，请同学们不要来北京，要沟通党和政府与同学对话的渠道，通过正常的民主程序反映自己的意见，坚决保护广大学生的爱国热情，坚决维护安定团结的大局。
