Chairman Wan Li of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress today issued a written statement in Shanghai. The full text is as follows:

Due to health reasons, I have ended my state visit to the United States ahead of schedule and am now in Shanghai for treatment. During my visit, I closely followed the developments in the domestic situation, and after returning to the country, I further understood the domestic situation from various aspects.

I have always believed that the broad masses of young students sincerely hope to promote democracy and combat corruption, and this patriotic enthusiasm is rare and precious. The Party and the government have given full affirmation to this. Young students have raised some problems in social life and government work and urgently demand that they be resolved as soon as possible. This is consistent with the goals that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the government are striving to achieve and will continue to promote and drive the improvement of the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the government. However, the situation has developed to the opposite of the good wishes of the broad masses of young students. Various circumstances indicate that there are indeed a very small number of people who are plotting political conspiracies, using the student movement to deliberately create turmoil, seriously disrupting the normal social, production, work, and living order, as well as teaching and research order in Beijing and many other places across the country. Their goal is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and change the socialist system. This is a serious violation of the constitution. The broad masses of citizens, including young students, must be highly vigilant. I believe that the patriotic enthusiasm of young students and the broad masses must be protected, and their excessive words and deeds in the student movement should not be pursued. Those who incite and create turmoil must be exposed.

I firmly support the important decision of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and fully agree with the important speeches made by Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, government, and military cadres meeting on May 19. The State Council, in accordance with the power granted by Article 89 of the Constitution, decided to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing, which is in accordance with and safeguards the Constitution. This is completely necessary to resolutely stop the turmoil and quickly restore order. I fully support the firm measures taken by the State Council. I believe the government can properly solve the problem. Our people should trust their government, support the government, support the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police, and do a good job in maintaining the normal order of the capital.

I believe that the problems raised by young students, such as accelerating the construction of democracy and the legal system, eliminating corruption, punishing officials who take bribes, and overcoming bureaucratism, can only be gradually solved under the conditions of stability and unity and on the track of democracy and the legal system. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress decided to hold a meeting around June 20 to discuss the problems that the people are generally concerned about, so as to supervise the government to improve its work. To hold a good meeting, we must strengthen the concept of democracy and the legal system, and we must have a stable and orderly environment; otherwise, the expected goal will be difficult to achieve.

At present, the situation in Beijing and some regions has not yet completely subsided. I sincerely hope that all conscious and patriotic citizens of the Republic will unite, and people from all walks of life will unite under the leadership of the Communist Party and the people's government to make due efforts to quickly end the chaotic situation and restore normal order. I am convinced that the reform and opening-up cause, initiated and personally guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and proven correct by practice, will definitely develop more healthily.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks to the Parliament and government of Canada and the United States for their friendly reception during my visit! I also express my gratitude to the overseas Chinese, Chinese people, and students there for their concern and enthusiasm.

### 万里委员长在沪发表书面谈话

　　万里委员长在沪发表书面谈话
    新华社上海５月２７日电  全国人大常委会委员长万里今天在上海发表书面谈话，全文如下：
    由于健康原因，我提前结束了对美国的国事访问，现在上海治疗。出访期间，我一直密切注视着国内局势的发展，回国后，又从多方面进一步了解了国内的情况。
    我一贯认为，广大青年学生真诚地希望促进民主，整治腐败，这种爱国热情难能可贵，党和政府给予了充分肯定。青年学生提出了社会生活和政府工作中存在的一些问题，迫切要求尽快解决，这同人大常委会和政府要努力实现的目标是一致的，已经并将继续对人大常委会和政府改进工作产生推动和促进作用。但是，事态的发展已经走向广大青年学生良好愿望的反面。种种情况表明，确实有极少数极少数人在搞政治阴谋，利用学潮，蓄意制造动乱，严重干扰了北京乃至全国许多地方正常的社会、生产、工作、生活和教学、科研秩序，他们的目的就是要推翻共产党的领导，改变社会主义制度。这是严重的违反宪法的行为。对此，广大公民包括青年学生要高度警觉。我认为，对于青年学生和广大群众的爱国热情必须加以保护，对他们在学潮中的过激言行不予追究。对于煽动和制造动乱的极少数人必须予以揭露。
    我坚决拥护中共中央政治局常委会的重要决定，完全同意李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志５月１９日在首都党政军干部大会上的重要讲话。国务院根据宪法第８９条赋予的权力，决定在北京部分地区实行戒严，是符合和维护宪法的，这对坚决制止动乱，迅速恢复秩序，是完全必要的。我完全支持国务院采取的这一坚定措施。我相信政府能够妥善地解决问题。我们的人民要信任自己的政府，支持政府，支持人民解放军和武警部队，做好维护首都正常秩序的工作。
    我认为，青年学生提出的加速民主和法制建设、消除腐败、惩治官倒、克服官僚主义等问题，只能在安定团结的条件下，在民主和法制的轨道上逐步解决。全国人大常委会决定６月２０日左右召开会议，讨论人民群众普遍关心的问题，以督促政府改进工作。要开好这次会议，必须增强民主和法制的观念，必须有一个安定和有秩序的环境，不然的话，预期的目的就难以实现。
    目前，北京和一些地区的事态尚未完全平息。我殷切希望，全体有觉悟有爱国心的共和国公民团结起来，社会各界人士团结起来，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，为迅速结束混乱状态，恢复正常秩序，作出应有的努力。我坚信，由邓小平同志开创和亲自指导的、并被实践证明是正确的改革开放事业，一定会更加健康地向前发展。
    最后，我愿借此机会，向加拿大、美国的议会和政府，对我访问期间的友好接待，表示感谢！对在那里的华侨、华人和留学生对我的关心和热情，也一并表示谢意。
      一九八九年五月二十七日
