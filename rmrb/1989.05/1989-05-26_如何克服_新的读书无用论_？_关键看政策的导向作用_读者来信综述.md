The key lies in the guiding role of policy

- Summary of Reader Letters

*Editor's Note: On February 22 this year, our newspaper specially opened a column to discuss the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading," which has attracted widespread attention. In the past three months, letters from readers discussing this topic have been pouring in daily, totaling over a thousand. Among them, there are many insightful views. In addition to publishing some of them in the newspaper, today we present a summary of these letters by our reporter as a conclusion to the column discussion. We will continue to welcome submissions on this topic in the future.*

*Cause: Low Cultural Management of the Entire Society*

*Our society is currently in a special stage where it is easy to become a millionaire but difficult to pursue academic achievements. Our nation is in a growth period where expenditure on eating and drinking exceeds investment in intelligence. At this juncture, the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" has emerged. Many readers in their letters pointed out that this is inevitable. In essence, it is the result of the entire society's low cultural management.*

*Hu Honglin from the Research Office of the Weicheng District Committee of Xianyang City, Shaanxi Province, wrote in a letter that although the central government has repeatedly emphasized that the education sector should have a breakthrough development, in reality, it has been difficult to make progress. The main reason is the short-term behavior of some local governments. Local governments have a term of three years, during which "economic performance is measured by production value, and urban appearance is measured by construction." Many people are eager to pursue short-term achievements that can quickly enhance their political performance, while disregarding medium and long-term goals. They are even willing to sacrifice long-term interests to seek immediate gains. Tasks like developing education are rarely considered.*

*Chen Ye, a reader from Hunan, pointed out in a letter that from the current appointment of cadres, except for the military, there are no clear cultural quality standards and requirements for local administrative, judicial cadres, enterprise managers, and the state. From top to bottom, there is no established system of cultural standards for the appointment of cadres. Low-cultured decision-makers leading modern enterprises inevitably show cultural limitations. Cui Limin, a reader from Baoji, listed phenomena such as "on one side, luxurious official buildings are rising, on the other side, the country's flowers are buried in dilapidated houses," and "on one side, social groups consume hundreds of billions, on the other side, education investment is difficult to increase" to illustrate this problem.*

*Some readers in their letters pointed out that knowledge-intensive intellectuals are well-informed and have a strategic role in scientific decision-making. They have a strong sense of democracy and participation, and are the backbone of modernization construction. However, they also raised another issue worth noting: that is, intellectuals' psychological imbalance during the shaking of traditional values, hesitation in the transition of new and old systems, and the mismatch between existing knowledge and actual needs in the development of the commodity economy. Wang Youliang, a reader from Hebei, particularly pointed out the strong dependence of intellectuals on the government: a university student from enrollment to graduation is arranged by the state, and when an individual worker seizes the opportunity to quickly rise to become a high-income group in society, most educated people, constrained by traditional thinking and various concerns, still cling to the "iron rice bowl" for a little oil, unwilling or daring to risk participating in the competition of the commodity economy, and thus unable to realize their own value and fully utilize their talents. In the educational sector, there is a psychological contradiction of "staying behind with low status, leaving with useless knowledge."*

*This psychological state of the intellectual community is representative of the entire society, but facing this situation, past education and ideological work can no longer adapt. Zhang Rui from the Party School of Yingshan County, Hubei, analyzed: Education has long been politically constrained and separated from the economy, always in a self-regulating closed state, with unclear supply and demand signals, distorted information transmission, and stagnant management system. As for macro-control, it was mainly realized through administrative commands and political education in the past, which was effective in the old system environment, but in the initial form of the commodity economy, it is difficult to play a role. This has caused the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" to quickly spread.*

*Harm: The Greatest Threat to the Four Modernizations*

*The harm of the "Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" is serious. The "Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" during the Cultural Revolution was accompanied by the spread of cultural phobia; now the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" is spreading under the influence of "money worship" at the same time as the emergence of value pluralism. They both have a negative impact on tens of thousands of students, causing some intellectuals to lower their standards for thinking, creating an unhealthy social mentality. Although this trend will not affect a small number of social elites, it may cause countless future elites to wither away, deepening the crisis of the entire education sector, which is the greatest threat to the Four Modernizations.*

*Cai Qingyong, a reader from Jilin Province, recorded the self-revelation of a young rural woman who had dropped out of school: "I am a 20-year-old girl. Five years ago, I ignorantly left school and now regret it deeply, spending every day in remorse. Now the countryside is no longer the same as before. Many agricultural science knowledge and cultural entertainment have entered the homes of farmers, but I can't even read slightly more profound newspapers now. How I yearn for school and knowledge now! But it can only be yearning."*

*A survey of 350 millionaires in a certain place found that 68% of them had completely lost their desire to learn, 25% thought it was irrelevant whether they read or not, and only 10% had the desire to read. Some students and parents see that people with low cultural knowledge can make big money and become bosses, and it is inevitable that they will have the idea of quitting school to do business. This mentality also appears in some primary schools, causing teachers to quit teaching and change jobs. A reader from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region wrote in a letter that in a certain key middle school, 65% of the backbone teachers have changed jobs since 1984. This is a real crisis. Two readers from Henan University wrote in a letter that Wang Fei, an associate professor at the school, surveyed 260 people in the Chinese Department, all of whom thought that there is currently a crisis in education, with 60% of them believing there is a serious crisis.*

*Way Out: Establish a Full-Employee Professional Cultural Standard System*

*Facing this situation, what should we do?*

*Many readers in their letters pointed out that we should find a way out from the policy. Xiao Kejin, a reader from Hubei, wrote in a letter that our education policy has made mistakes, but to find the cause from the policy, we must first find the cause from the guiding ideology of the decision-makers. Due to a mechanical understanding of the principle that "the economic base determines the superstructure," the key point of developing productive forces in the information age—prioritizing the development of education and science—has not been grasped. Education has not been established as a basic national policy, resulting in education being swayed back and forth for 40 years since the founding of the country, and not following the laws of education. Ten years of reform have benefited the people greatly, but due to mistakes in education policy, the enthusiasm for teaching and learning has been seriously dampened. But he pointed out that this "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" compared to the "Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" in the late 1950s and during the Cultural Revolution, has a fundamental difference. The root cause of the previous two errors was that the nature of knowledge and intellectuals was misunderstood. This time, it is just that the feasibility of certain policies has not been sufficiently studied, and the possible serious consequences have not been foreseen. As long as there is a basic consensus in understanding, correct policies can be formulated to turn the situation around, "after the low point comes the peak."*

*Zhang Rui, a reader from Shaanxi, wrote in a letter that the state should implement preferential policies for education to encourage parents to send their children to school. For those who do well, various methods can be adopted for commendation, such as exempting part of the taxes in rural areas and enjoying a certain amount of national child-rearing allowance for a certain period in urban areas; for families in difficulty, the problem of school fees for their children can be solved through interest-free loans and interest-free loans, thus providing material guarantees for the restoration of the tradition of respecting education and loving learning.*

*Many readers in their letters proposed that the Party's policy of enriching the people should also make intellectuals rich, and quickly solve the phenomenon of "brain-body inversion." Yang Shengrong, a reader from Sichuan, analyzed this phenomenon, saying that government management personnel are good at mobilizing the enthusiasm of manual laborers, and their labor is easy to quantify and calculate, paying according to labor; they are not good at mobilizing the enthusiasm of intellectuals, making most intellectuals in a state of observation, and their potential has not been fully tapped, especially the labor of intellectuals is not easy to quantify. If there is no obvious benefit, improving treatment may not be accepted by other laborers. This requires high-cultured management to fully play the role of intellectuals, and at the same time, policies should provide them with better working conditions. For example, school teachers should not only rely on their consciousness but also on the encouragement of society and certain material conditions to teach well; in this way, students can see hope from their teachers and have confidence to study. Some readers proposed that the policy should first make those intellectuals who have made contributions rich, so as to guide the whole society to pay attention to the investment of intelligence, and guide the masses to consume in a civilized way.*

*Many readers expressed concern about the quality of our cadre team because any good policy must be implemented by government cadres. If the cultural quality of this team is too low, or this team is not composed of social elites, even the best policy may be distorted in implementation. Hu Honglin, a reader from Xianyang City, wrote in a letter that we have high hopes for leaders at all levels of government, hoping that they will, with the future of the country and the fate of the nation in mind, focus on China's future, and with a high sense of responsibility to future generations, truly put the development of education in the first place, and contribute to improving the quality of the entire nation. He suggested that from the central to the local level, when selecting cadres and evaluating performance, education development should be regarded as an important item. Next, social concepts should be changed, and those leaders who strive to develop education should be given public opinion support, and those who have made outstanding contributions should be commemorated and recorded in history, while those who seek popularity and delay education should be dismissed.*

*To ensure the implementation of education policies, in addition to paying attention to government behavior and cadre quality, some readers also proposed to establish a restraint mechanism, through education legislation, government supervision, and the realization of governance by law. In education legislation, the first step is to improve the education legal system, such as basic education laws, departmental education laws, education administrative regulations, education administrative rules, and local education regulations. Next, the legal guarantee mechanism should be established, such as to implement the Compulsory Education Law, the Vocational Education Law can be formulated; in conjunction with the Vocational Education Law, the Protection of Minors Law can be formulated, etc.*

*Some readers think more broadly and propose that the whole society should pay attention to education. For this purpose, Chen Ye, a reader from Hunan, suggested establishing a full-employee professional cultural standard system, clearly stipulating cultural level requirements from government leaders to shop clerks, so that the government will no longer have leaders who cannot read work summaries, shops will no longer have salespeople who cannot issue invoices, and society will no longer have low-cultured people occupying positions of high-cultured people. Make every job seeker understand that they must first go to school.*

*To thoroughly overcome the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading" and improve the level of education and teaching quality, it is urgent to reform the teaching methods. Yao Hua, a reader from Heilongjiang, suggested that people with good political and professional qualities should be sent to the education front. Chen Rong, a reader from Jiangxi, suggested that through strict assessment and evaluation, 1 million unqualified teachers should be reduced, and the saved personnel costs should be used to increase educational equipment. More readers in their letters pointed out that education quality should be improved through deepening education reform. For this purpose, a nationwide education discussion should be held. Liang Ruowei, a reader from Guangxi, suggested that based on the discussion of the "New Theory of the Uselessness of Reading," the newspaper should quickly write a special article, accurately reflect the current situation of the problem, deeply reveal the root cause and harmfulness of the problem, and come up with solutions to the problem, so as to improve people's awareness and initiative to take action.*

### 如何克服“新的读书无用论”？  关键看政策的导向作用——读者来信综述

专栏：我看“新的读书无用论”

　　如何克服“新的读书无用论”？
    关键看政策的导向作用
    ——读者来信综述
    本报记者  周庆
    编者按：今年２月２２日，本报特辟专栏，开展我看“新的读书无用论”的讨论，受到社会的关注。３个月的时间，参加讨论的读者来信天天不断，总数逾千件，其中颇多真知灼见，除报纸上发表一部分外，今天将记者对这些来信的综述献给读者，作为专栏讨论告一段落的小结。今后仍欢迎这方面的来稿。
    　　　　
  原因：整个社会的低文化管理
    我们的社会正处在一个“当万元户易、做学问难”的特殊阶段。
    我们的民族正处在一个吃喝支出大于智力投资的生长期。
    恰逢其时，“新的读书无用论”抬头。不少读者来信指出，这有其必然性，从实质上讲，它是整个社会低文化管理的恶果。
    陕西省咸阳市渭城区委研究室胡宏纲来信说，中央三令五申，提出教育事业要有一个突破性的大发展，但实际上至今举步维艰；主要是一些地方政府的短期行为所致。地方政府每届任期３年，其间“经济看产值，面貌看城建”，许多人　热衷于抓短期内能突击政绩的事情，对中、长远目标不屑一顾，甚至不惜牺牲长远利益而邀功，像发展教育这样的软任务就很少顾及了。
    湖南读者成业来信指出，从目前干部的任职来看，除军队外，地方行政、司法干部、企业厂长、经理，国家都没有明文的文化素质规范与要求，从上到下没有建立一个任用干部的文化标准体系。低文化者决策领导现代化事业，不可能不表现出文化上的局限性。宝鸡读者崔利民列举了“一边是豪华官府如林拔起、一边是祖国花朵葬身危房”，“一边是社会集团消费几百亿、一边是教育投资难增长”等现象来说明这个问题。
    一些读者在来信中指出，读书较多的知识分子信息灵通，对科学决策有智囊作用，民主意识、参政意识强，是建设现代化的中坚力量。但同时也提出另一个值得注意的问题，那就是知识分子在传统的价值观动摇之际产生心态失衡，在新旧体制交替的蜕变中有徬徨，在商品经济的发展中已有的知识和实际需要不相适应。河北读者王有亮特别指出知识分子对政府的强烈的依赖性：一个大学生从入学到毕业工作，都由国家来安排，当个体劳动者抓住机遇，短时间内上升为社会中的高收入群体后，大部分读书人却囿于传统思想和各种顾虑，仍留恋于“铁饭碗”中的一点油水，不情愿或不敢冒险参与商品经济中的竞争，难以实现自己的价值，发挥自己的才干。在教育界，则出现“留下身价不高、出走知识无用”的矛盾心理。
    知识界的这种心态，在全社会有代表性，但面对这种状况，过去的教育和思想工作已不能适应。湖北郧阳地委党校张锐分析道：教育长期受政治嵌制而同经济隔离，始终处于自我调节的封闭状态，供求信号不明，信息传递失真，管理体制呆滞。至于宏观制衡，以往主要是通过行政命令和政治教育的方式实现，这在旧体制环境中是有效的，在初始的商品经济形态条件下，很难发挥作用。这就使得“新的读书无用论”很快蔓延开来。
  危害：对四化大业最大的威胁
    “读书无用论”的危害是严重的。“文革”中的“读书无用论”伴随文化恐惧症泛滥；现在“新的读书无用论”，则又在价值多元化出现的同时，受“金钱拜物教”影响蔓延，它们都对成千上万的学生产生消极影响，使一些知识分子降低了自己思考问题的尺度，造成一种不健康的社会心态。尽管这种思潮不会影响到少数社会精英，但它却可能使千千万万个未来的精英夭折，加深整个教育事业的危机，这是四化大业最大的威胁。
    吉林省读者蔡庆勇与一位辍学的农村女青年谈话时，记下了这位青年的自诉：“我是一个刚满２０岁的女孩子，５年前，我无知地离校弃学，现在追悔莫及，每天都在悔恨中度过。现在的农村再不是过去的农村了，许多农科知识和文化娱乐都已进入了农家，可我现在连稍深奥一点的报刊都读不了。如今，我是多么向往学校、向往知识啊！但也只能是向往而已。”
    某地党校对３５０个１０万元个体商的问卷调查发现，其中６８％的人完全丧失了致学意识，２５％的人认为读书与否无关紧要，只有１０％的人有读书欲望。一些学生、家长看到这些文化知识很低的人赚大钱、当老板，难免萌发弃学经商的念头。这种心理也出现在一些基层学校，造成教师弃教、改行。内蒙古自治区一读者来信说，某重点中学１９８４年以来６５％的骨干教师改行。这是现实的危机。河南大学两位读者来信介绍，该校副教授王非对中文系调查了２６０人，全都认为现在教育存在危机，其中６０％的人认为存在着严重危机。
  出路：建立全员职业文化标准体系
    面对这种情况，怎么办呢？
    许多读者来信指出，要从政策上找出路。湖北读者肖克瑾来信说，我们的教育政策有失误，但要从政策上找原因，就得先从决策人的指导思想上找原因。由于机械地理解“经济基础决定上层建筑”的原理，没有把握信息时代发展生产力的关节点——优先发展教育和科学，没有把发展教育定为基本国策，致使建国４０年来教育一直左右摇摆，没有走上按教育规律办事的轨道。１０年改革，人民受惠很大，但由于教育政策上的失误，严重地挫伤了教与学的积极性。但他指出，这次“新的读书无用论”与５０年代末和“文革”中的“读书无用论”相比，有着本质的区别。前两次错误的根本原因是把知识和知识分子的性质看错了，这次只是对某些政策的可行性研究不够，没有预见到可能会发生的严重后果，只要在认识上基本统一了，制定出正确的政策来，局面即可扭转，“低谷后面是高峰”。
    陕西读者张锐在来信中说，国家应对教育实行优惠政策，激励家长送子女上学的积极性。对于做得好的，可采取多种方式进行表彰，如在农村可以免交部分税款，在城市可以享受一定年限和一定数量的国家养育金等；对困难的家庭可以以贴息贷款和无偿贷款方式解决其子女上学的经费困难，以此为恢复尊教好学的传统提供物质保证。
    不少读者来信提出，党的富民政策应使知识分子也富起来，尽快解决“脑体倒挂”现象。四川读者杨胜荣分析这一现象时说，政府管理人员比较善于调动体力劳动者的积极性，其劳动也易于量化计算，按劳付酬；他们不善于调动知识分子的积极性，使多数知识分子处于观望状态，潜力远没有发掘出来，尤其是知识分子的劳动不易量化计算，如无明显效益，提高待遇未必能使其他劳动者接受。这就要靠高文化的管理充分发挥知识分子的作用，同时靠政策为他们提供较好的工作条件。比如学校老师，要让他们不仅靠觉悟、也靠社会的鼓励、一定的物质条件去教好书；这样学生从老师身上才能看到希望，有信心去读书。有的读者提出，政策应该首先使那些有贡献的知识分子富起来，这样，才会引导整个社会向重视智力投资的方向发展，才会引导群众文明消费。
    广大读者对我们干部队伍的素质表示担忧，因为任何好的政策，都要通过政府的干部去执行，如果这支队伍的文化素质太低，或者说这支队伍不是由社会精英所组成，再好的政策也可能在执行中变了样子。咸阳市读者胡宏纲来信说，我们寄厚望于各级政府领导人，希望他们以国家前途和民族命运为念，着眼于中国的未来，本着对子孙后代高度负责的精神，真正把发展教育放在首要位置，为提高全民族的素质做出贡献，切不可继续以短期行为危害教育事业，做民族的千古罪人。为此，他建议从中央到地方在选拔干部、考核政绩时，把教育发展当作一项重要内容。其次，要改变社会观念，对那些努力抓教育的领导人，给以舆论支持，功勋卓著者，为他树碑立传，让他名垂青史，而对那些哗众取宠、延误了教育的人，则要予以罢免。
    为了保证教育政策的落实，在重视政府行为、干部素质的同时，有的读者还提出建立制约机制，通过教育立法，政府督导，实现以法治教。在教育立法中，首先要完善教育法规体系，如教育基本法、教育部门法、教育行政法规、教育行政规章、地方教育法规等。其次，要确立法律的保证机制，如为贯彻《义务教育法》，可制定《普及义务教育法》；结合《职业技术教育法》可制定《未成年人保护法》等。
    有的读者把问题想得更宽，提出要使全社会重视教育。为此，湖南读者成业建议建立全员职业文化标准体系，从政府领导到商店的营业员，都要明文规定文化水平要求，从而使政府不再出现读不来工作总结的首长，商店不再出现开不出发票的售货员，社会不再出现低文化者抢占高文化者岗位的现象。使每一个想求职的人都明白自己首先要去读书才行。
    为了彻底克服“新的读书无用论”，提高教育水平、教学质量，改革教学方法也迫在眉睫。黑龙江读者姚华陌建议，把政治、业务素质好的人充实到教育战线。江西读者陈荣建议，通过严格考核、评审，将不合格的教师裁减100万，把省下来的人头费用于增加教育设备。更多的读者来信指出，要通过深化教育改革来提高教育质量，为此，要开展全民教育大讨论。广西读者梁若伟建议，本报在开展我看“新的读书无用论”的基础上，尽快写出专题文章，确切反映问题的现状，深刻揭示问题的根源及危害性，拿出解决问题的办法，从而提高人们行动的自觉性、主动性。
