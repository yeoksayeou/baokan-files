In memory of Comrade Liu Ruilong, who passed away fifty-nine years after the Tongmenghui Uprising.

In his youth, he raised the banner of righteousness, working together with comrades in the enemy-occupied areas of Su and Huan.

He humbly served the people, treating comrades with the utmost sincerity.

His revolutionary will was as firm as iron, and his noble character will be recorded in history.

I mourn your departure before me, gazing at the distant moon and sun with tears in my eyes.

　　痛悼刘瑞龙同志
    张爱萍
    通如起义穗辞世，五十九载如流矢。
    义旗少年同心举，敌后苏皖共磋事。
    俯首甘为孺子牛，亲密无间待同志。
    革命意志坚如铁，高风亮节载青史。
    哀君先我驾鹤去，含泪遥望光月日。
