Title: Rural Economy Needs to Develop, Farmers' Quality Needs to Improve

During the 10 years of reform, the industrial structure of rural areas in our province has shifted from a single focus on grain production to a diversified approach including agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. A large number of laborers have transitioned from agriculture to non-agricultural industries, with the output value of non-agricultural industries exceeding that of agriculture. However, in recent years, agricultural production has stagnated, the efficiency of township enterprises has slowed, and the overheating development of the tertiary sector has affected the further development of the rural economy. The causes of this situation are multifaceted, but I believe that the relatively low quality of rural labor is a significant factor.

Agriculture needs to develop by relying on the progress of science and technology. However, for science and technology to be transformed into productive forces, a workforce with a certain level of professional technical skills is required. Currently, the situation of rural labor in our province reveals three main issues:

First, the cultural level is relatively low. According to a survey, in 1988, the cultural structure of rural labor in our province was as follows: laborers with a high school education or above accounted for only 5.3%, those with a junior high school education accounted for 38.2%, those with an elementary school education accounted for 43.6%, and about 13% were illiterate or semi-illiterate. Due to the generally low educational level of farmers, although they know that scientific farming can increase production and income, they lack the necessary knowledge.

Second, there is a shortage of technical personnel. According to a 1986 survey, our province had only 11,346 technical personnel working at the county, township, and village levels, with only 5.2 technical personnel per 10,000 agricultural population, which is below the national average. Especially in the township enterprise system, technical personnel are even fewer, with only 0.06 per enterprise. Due to the lack of technical personnel, many township enterprises are technologically backward, with poor product quality and low economic efficiency.

Third, vocational education is declining. According to a survey, in 1988, the province had 17 agricultural vocational schools, a decrease of 9 from 1987, with 888 fewer graduates than the previous year, and both enrollment and the number of students in school were decreasing. Moreover, the professional courses offered did not align with the actual production needs of the local area.

To strengthen rural vocational education, I have a few suggestions:

First, we need to establish the concept among the masses that employment requires a certain level of cultural quality and skills.

Second, while continuing to promote literacy and the nine-year compulsory education system, we should develop various forms and levels of vocational and technical education.

We should vigorously develop agricultural vocational schools and rural vocational high schools. In areas with conditions, some general high schools can be converted into vocational high schools, or based on local actual conditions, vocational and technical classes can be set up in general high schools.

Additionally, vocational and technical education should be coordinated with the development of the rural economy. It should be based on the demand for laborers from the adjustment of the industrial structure to determine the professional courses and the number of people to be trained, so as to achieve a combination of training and employment.

### 农村经济要发展  农民素质应提高

　　农村经济要发展  农民素质应提高
    １０年改革期间，我省农村产业结构从单一的粮食生产转向农、林、牧、副、渔多种经营，大批劳动力从农业转向非农产业，非农业产值超过农业产值。但近几年，农业生产出现徘徊，乡镇企业效益增长减缓，第三产业发展过热，已影响农村经济的进一步发展。造成这种情况的原因固然是多方面的，可我认为农村劳动力素质较低，是个重要因素。
    农业要发展须依靠科学技术的进步。可科学技术要转化为生产力，就要求有一支具备一定专业技术的劳动大军，而目前我省农村劳动力现状，却明显暴露出三方面问题：
    一是文化素质偏低。据调查，１９８８年我省农村劳动力文化素质结构为：高中以上文化程度的劳力仅占５．３％，初中文化程度的劳力占３８．２％，小学文化程度的劳力占４３．６％，１３％左右的劳力是文盲和半文盲。由于农民文化程度普遍偏低，明知科学种田能增产增收，但苦于缺少知识。
    二是科技人员少。据１９８６年调查，我省在县、乡、村工作的科技人员只有１１３４６人，农业人口每万人中只有科技人员５．２人，低于全国平均水平。尤其是乡镇企业系统，科技人员更少得可怜，每个企业只有０．０６人。由于缺少技术人员，许多乡镇企业技术落后，产品质量差，经济效益低。
    三是职业教育下降。据调查，１９８８年，全省有农民中等专业学校１７所，比１９８７年减少９所，毕业生也比上年减少８８８人，招生数和在校生数都在减少。而且，开设的专业也没有与当地实际生产需要相结合。
    为加强农村职业教育，我有几点建议：
    首先，要在群众中树立劳动就业必须具备一定的文化素质和技能的观念。
    其次，在坚持扫盲、普及九年制义务教育的前提下，开展多种形式、多层次的职业技术教育。
    大力发展农业中等专业学校和农村职业中学，有条件的地区可把部分普通中学改为职业中学，或者从当地实际情况出发，在普通中学中开设职业技术班。
    另外，职业技术教育要与农村经济协调发展，要从产业结构调整对劳动者的需求出发，决定所学专业和培养人数，做到培养和使用相结合。
