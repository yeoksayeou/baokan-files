In recent years, on the Su North Canal, some state-owned, collective, and township enterprises' shipping fleets have brazenly sold state-owned coal to coal dealers and speculators along the route, profiting from it.

On March 24, the 007 fleet of the Weishan County Shipping Company in Shandong Province, while transporting coal through the jurisdiction of Suyang County in our province, sold dozens of tons of coal in one go, with prices ranging from 80 to 130 yuan per ton. In early April, I boarded a ship and arrived at the Suyang ship lock, where I discovered coal speculators negotiating coal transactions with a certain coal-carrying fleet. In less than 10 minutes, a deal was struck. This fleet sold coal at 90 yuan per ton, with the delivery point less than 10 kilometers away from the Suyang ship lock.

Currently, coal is in short supply in southern Jiangsu. Some shipping fleets responsible for coal transportation, for the sake of personal gain, blatantly disregard state laws and seize the opportunity to steal and sell coal. This is truly infuriating.

### 一些船队盗卖国家煤炭成风

　　一些船队盗卖国家煤炭成风
    近年来，在苏北运河上，一些国营、集体和乡镇企业的水运船队，肆无忌惮地把承运的公家煤炭盗卖给沿途的煤贩子、煤倒爷，从中获利。
    ３月２４日，山东微山县航运公司００７船队装运煤炭途经我省泗阳县境内时，一次就卖了几十吨煤，每吨售价８０元至１３０元。４月初，我随船来到泗阳船闸，发现煤倒爷与某运煤船队洽谈煤炭交易。不到１０分钟，一笔交易便谈成了。这个船队以每吨９０元的价格出售煤炭，交货地点仅离泗阳船闸不到１０公里处。
    目前，江南煤炭十分紧缺。担负煤炭运输任务的一些船队为了私利，竟置国家法律于不顾，乘机盗卖煤炭，这实在令人气愤。
