The U.S. Air Force today conducted its first test launch of the Midget missile from a base in California into the Pacific Ocean. The missile malfunctioned 70 seconds into its flight, and the Air Force detonated it. The Midget missile is one of two mobile land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles that President Bush recently decided to develop. It is reported that the problems encountered in today's test will reignite the debate between Congress and the government over whether this missile can be used to update land-based strategic nuclear missiles.
