"Beep—beep beep beep—" The sharp whistles never stopped, and one vehicle after another, carrying students who had fainted from hunger strikes, rushed towards the Beijing Municipal Emergency Center and various hospital emergency rooms. Today marks the fifth day of the hunger strike by over 3,000 students from Beijing universities at Tiananmen Square. Under the scorching sun, most students on the square have experienced dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, convulsions, and restlessness due to hunger striking. Some students have even developed severe conditions such as supraventricular tachycardia, renal failure, circulatory collapse, and coma. Thousands of medical staff from dozens of hospitals and clinics in Beijing are working tirelessly to save the students on the square and in hospitals.

Medical personnel on the scene, anxious and worried, said that if the students continue their hunger strike, relying solely on drinking glucose-salt water is insufficient to sustain life; although intravenous injections of various amino acids can be used, the city currently lacks sufficient supplies; even if the students stop their hunger strike immediately, some may still suffer from long-term brain damage and other sequelae, potentially affecting them for life.

A doctor who has been on the square for five consecutive days treating students said that hunger striking without drinking water generally has a life limit of 7-12 days, but the students' physical condition is already poor. On the first day of the hunger strike, they walked from their schools to Tiananmen Square, consuming a lot of energy. These days, they have been exposed to the scorching sun during the day and cold winds at night. The square has no sanitary facilities, the air is polluted, and the students are under immense psychological pressure. In the next two days, many students will be in critical condition. The doctor, tears in his eyes, said that the night is even more dangerous. The square is dimly lit, and medical personnel cannot measure the students' blood pressure or monitor their condition. If a student dies in their sleep, it will be difficult to detect. More seriously, yesterday there were 12 students who had stopped drinking water on the north side of the Great Hall of the People, and today that number has increased to over 20. Of the original 12 students, 8 have already been sent for intravenous drip treatment.

According to incomplete statistics, by 6 PM today, a total of 1,768 students suffering from various ailments have been rushed to 32 hospitals in the city for emergency treatment, with 803 students remaining in the hospital for observation and treatment. Just today, 740 students have been treated in the emergency rooms of various hospitals, with 503 students remaining in the hospital for observation.

### 救救学生　救救孩子——天安门广场绝食学生实况录

　　救救学生　救救孩子    
    ——天安门广场绝食学生实况录
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    “嘀哒——嘀哒嘀哒——”一声声尖利的笛声不绝于耳，一辆辆载着绝食昏倒的学生驶向北京市急救中心和各大医院急救室。今天，是北京高校３０００余名学生在天安门广场绝食第５天。烈日当空，广场大部分学生因绝食而引起脱水、电解质紊乱、抽搐、烦躁，有的同学甚至出现了室上性心动过速、肾功能衰竭、体循环衰竭、昏迷等严重症状。北京数十家医院和各大单位门诊部的数千名医护人员在广场和医院紧张地救治学生。
    在现场救治学生的医务人员焦急万分地说，如果同学们继续绝食，仅靠饮用葡萄糖盐水难以维持生命；而用静脉注射多种氨基酸，目前全市又药源不足；即使同学们立即停止绝食，也因部分学生绝食后可能引起远期脑损害等后遗症，以至贻害他的终生。
    连续５天在广场参加救治学生的一位医生说，绝食不绝水，生命极限一般在７—１２天，但学生们的体质本来差，绝食第一天又远道从学校步行至天安门广场，体力消耗很大，这几天白天烈日晒，夜晚冷风吹，广场无任何卫生条件，空气混浊，绝食学生精神压力极大。今、明两天不少学生生命处于危急状态，这位医生流着泪说，夜间更危险，广场灯光暗，医护人员无法为学生测血压和观察病情，如果有学生在昏睡中死亡很难发现。更为严重的是，昨天１２名在人大会堂北侧绝水的学生今天已增至２０多名。原１２名学生中，有８名先后被送去输液抢救。
    据不完全统计，截至今晚６点，绝食学生中患各种病症被送往市内３２家医院抢救的共有１７６８人次，留院观察治疗８０３人次。仅在今天各院门诊抢救就达７４０人次，留院观察５０３人次。
