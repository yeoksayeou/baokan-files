Yesterday, Comrade Xiaoping said during his meeting with Iranian President Khomeini, “China must strive for a stable international and domestic environment to develop itself.”

On May 4, Comrade Ziyang said during his meeting with guests attending the ADB annual meeting, discussing the recent protests by some students in Beijing and other places, “What is most needed now is calmness, rationality, restraint, and order, to solve problems within the framework of democracy and the rule of law.”

The remarks made by the central leaders are extremely important.

China needs stability. This is crucial for the fate and future of the country and the nation, and it is also in the interest of all ethnic groups in the country, including the broad masses of young students. How can we achieve stability? Calmness, rationality, restraint, and order are indeed what is most needed and the only correct attitude at present.

In the past period, the administrative authorities, teachers, and students, as well as the Party and Youth League organizations and student unions of higher education institutions in the capital and other places, have done a great deal of work to maintain the normal teaching order. Although some students still went on strike and protested, the government has consistently adopted a calm, rational, and restrained attitude. Most students have also shown increasing rationality. Through the joint efforts of all parties concerned, the escalation of the situation has been avoided. Most students have already returned to class.

Now, dialogue between the government and students has begun and will continue extensively at multiple levels and through various channels. More and more people have come to realize that the problems existing in our country, including some problems raised by students, can only be gradually solved in a stable overall situation and within the framework of democracy and the rule of law. This still requires the joint efforts of all parties concerned.

In recent days, some students in certain universities in Beijing have not yet returned to class and continue to protest, causing some disruption to the capital's traffic and normal social life. We hope that these students can also calm down and adopt a rational attitude, return to class as soon as possible, and together maintain the overall stability and the normal order of various aspects of our country and society. This is the wish of the people of the entire nation.

　　共同维护稳定的大局
    本报评论员
    昨天，小平同志在会见伊朗总统哈梅内伊时说：“中国要力争有个稳定的国际环境和国内环境，把自己发展起来。”
    ５月４日，紫阳同志在会见出席亚行年会的客人，谈到最近北京等地部分学生的游行时说：“现在最需要的是冷静、理智、克制、秩序，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。”
    中央领导同志的这些讲话，是极其重要的。
    中国需要稳定，这是国家和民族命运、前途之所系，也是全国各族人民，包括广大青年学生利益之所在。怎样才能稳定呢？冷静、理智、克制、秩序，确实是当前最需要的，也是唯一正确的态度。
    前一段，首都等地高等学校行政当局、师生、党团组织和学生会为维护学校的正常教学秩序，做了大量工作。尽管仍有学生举行罢课、游行，政府始终采取冷静、理智、克制的态度，大多数学生也日益表现出理智。在有关各方的共同努力下，避免了事态的激化。大部分的学生已经复课。
    现在，政府与学生间的对话已经开始，还将在多层次、多渠道上广泛地继续进行。越来越多的人认识到，我们国家存在的问题，包括学生提出的一些问题，只能在稳定的大局下，在民主和法制的轨道上逐步解决。这仍然需要有关各方面共同努力。
    近几日，北京某些高校仍有部分学生未曾复课，并继续游行，对首都的交通以及正常的社会生活造成一定影响。我们希望这部分同学也能冷静地思考一下，采取理智的态度，尽快地去上课，共同维护稳定的大局，维护我们国家和社会生活各方面的正常秩序。这是全国人民的心愿。
