	Banzar Leads in Bolivian Election

	Buenos Aires, May 8 (Xinhua) — La Paz, May 8 (Xinhua) — In yesterday's election, former military president and candidate of the Nationalist Democratic Action Party, Banzar, led in the vote count. However, he did not meet the constitutional requirement of securing more than half of the votes. Therefore, the next president of Bolivia will be decided by the parliament from the two candidates who received the most votes.

	According to more than 50% of the votes that have been counted, Banzar received 30% of the votes, while the second place went to the ruling party's candidate, Sánchez de Lozada, who received 26.35% of the votes. The official results will be announced at the end of this month. The constitution stipulates that if no candidate secures more than half of the votes in the election, the new president will be decided by the parliament from the two candidates who received the most votes. In the 1985 election, Banzar also received the most votes but did not secure more than half, and was eventually defeated by Esdenso in the parliament. Before this election, Banzar stated that his party would respect the parliament's decision.

　　班塞尔在玻大选中得票领先
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯５月８日电  记者李志明报道：拉巴斯消息，在昨天举行的大选中，前军人总统、民族主义民主行动党的班塞尔得票领先，但是未达到宪法要求的必须超过半数票的规定，因此，玻利维亚下一任总统将由议会在两名得票最多的候选人中决定。
    根据已经计算的５０％以上的选票，班塞尔获得３０％的选票，居第二位的是执政党候选人桑切斯·德洛萨达，获得２６．３５％的选票。正式计票结果本月底才能公布。宪法规定，如果大选中没有一名候选人得票超过半数，新总统将由议会在两名得票最多的候选人当中决定。１９８５年的大选中，班塞尔曾得票最多，但不过半数，结果在议会中被埃斯登索罗击败。班塞尔在这次选举前表示，他的党将尊重议会的决定。
