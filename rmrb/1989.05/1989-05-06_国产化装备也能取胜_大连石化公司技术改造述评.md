Domestic Equipment Can Also Win
— An Evaluation of the Technological Transformation of Dalian Petrochemical Company
By Duan Xinqiang, People's Daily Reporter

In terms of foreign exchange earnings, nearly $300 million annually, is a major contributor;
In terms of imports, not a single complete set of equipment was purchased from abroad.

Dalian Petrochemical Company uses domestically produced equipment to produce 61 types of export products, winning international recognition.

Between Bitterness and Joy

When the country opened up, the leaders of Dalian Petrochemical Company looked out and their eyes widened in surprise: the gap was so wide! Energy consumption was twice as high as others, and the products were several generations behind.

They were not willing to accept this and wanted to compete. They also wanted to take a shortcut by importing equipment, but they encountered a "roadblock." To improve the octane rating of gasoline, they built a "reforming" unit and imported a hydrogen compressor from West Germany. Initially, it operated well, but the good times didn't last. It frequently malfunctioned, requiring replacement parts. There were none domestically, so they had to buy them abroad. The extra travel expenses were secondary; unexpectedly, this machine had already been phased out, and even the manufacturing plant couldn't be found.

Heavy oil catalytic cracking is one of the "five flowers" in the refining industry, capable of turning low-grade heavy oil into high-grade fuel. They spent over $5 million to purchase equipment from the United States, West Germany, Japan, Canada, and other countries to assemble what was dubbed the "Eight-Nation Alliance." However, due to poor "digestion," the trial run experienced "intestinal obstruction," and the heavy oil not only didn't "upgrade" but some even became waste products...

Frustration bred determination and wisdom. The scientific and technological personnel of Dalian Petrochemical Company investigated the refining status abroad and the refining equipment production conditions at home. Through collective efforts, they found their own path to catch up! They started with the design and transformation of the entire set of equipment for producing lubricating oil: most of the equipment was domestically produced; a few items that were not available domestically but were genuinely advanced abroad were purchased, digested, and modified. The base oil produced passed the inspections of major oil companies around the world, such as Mobil, and received the "green light" from the international market.

They also cooperated with some domestic factories to design and transform an entire set of catalytic cracking equipment, which succeeded on the first trial run...

A Group of Engineering and Technical Personnel

Some engineering and technical personnel compared domestic and foreign mechanical production and elevated a method of creating excellence from inferiority. Individually, the mechanical plants were not highly advanced, but when combined into a "team," they could participate in "international competitions." The original propane deasphalting unit was not very advanced, so they decided to perform a "major surgery," which required over a hundred pieces of equipment. They conducted nationwide investigations and comparisons, appraisals, and selections of similar products from various factories. Except for three booster pumps imported from Japan, all other equipment was domestically produced. ... The "grand chorus" of dozens of enterprises was very successful. After the transformation, the energy consumption per ton of processed crude oil was reduced to 340,000 kcal, reaching the world's advanced level; the quality of the bright oil was excellent and won the national gold medal.

Dalian Petrochemical Company also paid attention to adopting domestic and foreign scientific research achievements. They especially focused on applying domestic scientific research achievements to production in a timely manner. For example, the food-grade wax they produced underwent hydrogenation treatment at 280°C, achieving international standards for the decomposition of carcinogenic substances. The chairman of the American Petroleum Wax Association, D.S. Brown, inspected the bulk food-grade wax produced by Dalian Petrochemical Company with a skeptical attitude. When the data displayed on the computer screen was not inferior to that of the United States, this pragmatic scientist's face lit up with a smile, and he immediately made a decision on the spot: "The quality is excellent." Thus, this bulk food-grade wax entered the American market; soon, it was selling well around the world...

Domestic and Foreign Integration

Domestication is not the same as national essence. Dalian Petrochemical Company insisted on using domestically produced equipment as the mainstay during technological transformation, but they did not shield or indulge. Some single machines produced domestically were indeed not as good as foreign ones, so they resolutely imported them and integrated them with domestically produced equipment for coordinated production.

White clay refining filtration, high temperature reaching 150°C, previously used plate and frame filters, manual operation, not only the filtration effect was poor, but also the labor intensity was high, dirty and tiring, and workers did not want to work there. Deputy Chief Engineer Qin Lixin saw a filtration machine used for treating sewage in Japan during his visit, operated by a mechanical arm, accurate and timely. Upon returning to the country, he immediately reported to the factory leadership, and the decision was made on the spot to import it.

While creating high-quality products through technological transformation, they invested a lot of effort in organizing product exports to earn foreign exchange. Today, standing on the hill behind the factory area, one can see that a piece of the sea near the company has been reduced, which is the newly built factory area of 500,000 square meters created by leveling the mountain; a "steel and concrete arm" extends into the sea, which is the newly built export wharf!

Six new deep-processing units for refining are rising from the newly reclaimed land!

In the near future, six 5,000 to 50,000-ton berths on the wharf will be put into use, and more and more ships will set sail from here, riding the wind and waves, heading out to sea...

　　国产化装备也能取胜   
     ——大连石化公司技术改造述评
    本报记者  段心强
    论创汇，每年近３亿美元，是大户；
    数引进，没从国外买一套完整的装备。
    大连石化公司就是利用国产化的装备生产出６１种出口产品，在国际上赢得信誉。
    　　　　苦乐之间
    国门打开，大连石化公司领导人往外一瞧，一双眼睛变成“Ｏ”型：差这么多？！耗能为人家的二倍，产品却落后几代。
    他们不服气，要竞争，而且想借引进设备走一条捷径，可遇到的是“顶门炮”。为了提高汽油标号，他们建一套“重整”装置，从联邦德国进口氢压机。开始运转得不错，可好景不长，接二连三出故障，需换零部件。国内没有，到国外去买。多花路费还在其次，意外的是这种机器已经淘汰，连生产厂都找不到。
    重渣油催化裂化是炼油行业“五朵金花”中的一朵，能使低档的重渣油变成高档燃料。他们花掉５００多万美元，从美国、联邦德国、日本、加拿大等国家买来设备组装，号称“八国联军”。但因“消化”不良，试车中“肠梗阻”，重渣油不但没“升级”，反而有的成了废品……
    困惑逼出志气和智慧，大连石化公司科技人员调查了国外的炼油现状与国内的炼油设备生产条件，群策群力，走自己的路子赶上去！他们从设计改造润滑油生产的全套装置开始：设备，绝大部分用国产的；少数国内没有，国外确实先进，就买来消化、改制。生产出的润滑油的基础油，通过了莫比尔等世界各大石油公司的鉴定，国际市场给开了“绿灯”。
    他们还和国内一些厂家合作，自己设计、改造一整套催化裂化装置，一次试车成功……
    　　　　集精汇萃
    一些工程技术人员对比中外的机械生产，升华出一个以劣创优的办法。就一个个机械厂说，水平不算高，但组成“联队”就可参与“国际比赛”。原有的丙烷脱沥青装置工艺不太先进，他们决定“动大手术”，这需要上百台设备。他们在全国调查研究，对各家工厂生产的同类产品进行比较、鉴定、精选。除三台增压泵从日本引进外，其他设备全部国内生产。……几十家企业“大合唱”十分成功。改造后每加工一吨原油的耗能下降到３４万大卡，达到世界先进水平；光亮油质量好，获得国家金牌。
    大连石化公司还注意采用国内外的科研成果。特别注意把国内的科研成果及时应用到生产上。例如他们生产的食品蜡，经２８０℃的加氢处理，使致癌物质分解度达到国际水平。美国石蜡协会主席Ｄ·Ｓ·布郎带着怀疑的心理鉴定大连石化公司生产的散装食品蜡。当电子计算机上显示的一个个数据不比美国的差时，这位求实的科学家脸上露出笑容，当场拍板定论：“质量为上乘”。于是，这种散装食品蜡便进入美国市场；不久，畅销世界各地……
    　　　　中西嫁接
    国产化不是国粹化。大连石化公司坚持在技术改造中以国产设备为主，但不护短、迁就。有些单机国产的就是不如国外的，就坚决引进，与国产设备搞好“嫁接”，协调生产。
    白土精制过滤，高温达到１５０℃，过去使用的板框过滤机，手工操作，不仅过滤效果差，而且劳动强度大，又脏又累，职工都不愿意在这里干。副总工程师秦立新在日本考察时见到人家处理粪便使用一种过滤机，由机械手操作，准确而又及时。回国后立即向厂领导汇报，当即拍板，决定引进来。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    在通过技术改造创造出优质产品的同时，他们花很大力气组织产品出口创汇。今天站在厂区后面的山头上，细心看就会发现，靠近公司的海面少了一块，这是开山填的５０万平方米的新厂区；一条钢铁水泥铸成的“手臂”向大海里延伸，这是新建的出口码头！
    炼油深加工的６套新装置正在填海造出的新区拔地而起！
    不久的将来，码头上的６个５０００到５万吨的泊位投用，将有越来越多的航船，从这里乘风破浪，驶向海洋……
