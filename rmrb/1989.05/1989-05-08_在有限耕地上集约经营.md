Intensive Farming on Limited Arable Land
Sun Jianqi

The limited arable land, the small amount of arable land per capita, and the relatively low production level in China determine that agriculture must break through its stagnation by intensive farming on limited arable land, increasing land productivity, and boosting the total output of agricultural products. Only through intensive farming, adopting more new technologies, promoting new yield-increasing measures, investing more funds and labor, and raising the output per unit can we meet the society's growing demand for agricultural products. The experience of developed countries has shown that the improvement of modern agricultural production levels is mainly achieved through scientific and technological progress and intensive farming. The fact that China's arable land has not increased much since liberation, while the output has increased several times, also proves this point.

An important fact that cannot be ignored is that the internal vitality of household farming has not been fully unleashed. With the current technological measures, there is still a large potential for increasing yields. Farmers also have high hopes for arable land. According to a survey in Shangqiu, Henan, since 1984, under roughly the same conditions of arable land and production, the area with a grain yield of more than 400 kilograms per mu is less than 20%, and the area with a yield of less than 300 kilograms per mu is nearly 80%. From the current production, resource, and technological conditions in the area, the average yield per mu can reach 600 kilograms. The problem lies in the fact that most of the households with strong production capacity often cannot increase production quickly because they lack good seeds and cannot buy the necessary fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, and other agricultural production materials. This phenomenon is also quite common nationwide.

Intensive farming and increasing land productivity are important ways for households to increase income. Generally speaking, the economic benefits of household land management are determined by three factors: land productivity, land area, and agricultural product prices. Under the current situation, it is not possible to expand the arable land area in the short term, and agricultural product prices will not be adjusted significantly in the short term. Therefore, the increase in household income can only rely on the continuous improvement of land productivity and the reasonable adjustment of agricultural product prices. During periods of relatively stable prices, the main way to increase income is to improve land productivity. This requires mobilizing farmers to focus on improving land productivity and creating a social environment conducive to the full play of their initiative.

A good environment, in my opinion, mainly includes policy encouragement, institutional constraints, and price incentives. On the one hand, we need to reform the price system, gradually raise the prices of agricultural products, especially grains, and rationalize the price ratios of agricultural products and the price ratios of agricultural products to industrial products. We should adhere to the principle of exchanging goods according to the law of value, and at the same time, implement supportive policies for agriculture to encourage farmers to engage in intensive farming on limited arable land and increase the production of agricultural products. This will make farmers truly realize that intensive farming through diligent labor and increased investment is the main way to achieve income comparable to other industries. On the other hand, we need to establish and improve the land compensation system to encourage farmers to increase investment and enhance the momentum for agricultural development.

In the process of implementing intensive farming and improving the level of intensification, due to the continuous increase in input, the land productivity and the output of agricultural products will also increase, but the total production cost and the cost per unit of arable land will inevitably increase. We must prevent the unreasonable input of production materials, avoid high investment, high cost, and low efficiency, and prevent the phenomenon of increased production but not increased income, or even reduced income.

　　在有限耕地上集约经营
    孙鉴奇
    我国耕地面积的有限性、人均耕地很少和生产水平较低的现实，决定了农业突破徘徊必须在有限的耕地上集约经营，提高土地产出水平，增加农产品总量。只有集约经营，采用更多的新技术，推广新的增产措施，投入更多的资金和劳动，提高单位产出水平，才能满足社会对农产品日益增长的需要。发达国家的经验证明，近代农业生产水平的提高，主要是靠科学技术提高和集约经营。我国解放以后耕地面积很少增加，而产量成倍提高的事实，也证明了这一点。
    一个不可忽视的事实是，农户家庭经营的内在活力还远没有充分发挥，利用现有的技术措施，土地还有较大的增产潜力。农民对耕地也还寄予很大的希望。据河南商丘地区调查，１９８４年以来，在耕地及生产条件大体相同的情况下，全区粮食亩产４００公斤以上的土地还不到２０％，亩产３００公斤以下的土地近８０％。从该区现有生产、资源、技术条件看，平均亩产饱和点可达到６００公斤。问题就在于大多数生产能力较强的农户，往往因为没有良种，买不到所需的化肥、农药、柴油等农用生产资料而无法较快地增产。这种现象，在全国也是较普遍的。
    集约经营，提高土地产出水平，是农户增收的重要途径。一般地来说，农户的土地经营效益，由土地产出水平、土地数量和农产品价格三个因素决定。在目前情况下，由于耕地面积的普遍扩大一时还做不到，农产品价格也不会马上有较大幅度调整，农户收益的提高，只能依赖于土地产出水平的持续提高和农产价格水平的合理调整。在价格水平相对稳定时期，则主要以土地产出水平提高来增加收入。这就需要调动农民以提高土地产出率为目标的生产积极性，并为此创造一个有利于积极性发挥的社会环境。
    良好的环境，我以为主要包括：政策鼓励、制度约束和价格刺激。一方面要改革价格体系，逐步提高农产品特别是粮食价格，理顺农产品自身比价和农产品同工业品价格的关系，坚持按价值规律交换商品，同时辅以扶持农业的实惠政策，调动农民在有限面积的耕地上集约经营，增加农产品产量的积极性，使农民真正认识到，通过精心劳动和增加投入的集约经营，是取得与它业大致同样收入的主要途径；另一方面要建立、完善土地补偿制度，促使农民增加投入，增强农业发展后劲。
    在实行集约经营，提高集约化水平的过程中，由于投入的不断增加，土地产出水平和农产品产量也在增加，但生产费用总量和单位耕地面积上的成本也必然不断提高。要防止投入生产资料不合理，出现投资大、成本高、效果差，增产不增收，甚至增产减收的现象。
