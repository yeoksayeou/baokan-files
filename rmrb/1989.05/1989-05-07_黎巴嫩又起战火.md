Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 6th.

Lebanon, which had observed a nine-day unstable ceasefire under the appeal of the Arab League, saw renewed fighting this afternoon between the Christian government army and the Muslim Progressive Socialist Party militia backed by Syria.

In areas such as Ashrafiyeh along the coast and the port of Beirut, both sides exchanged artillery and rocket fire, resulting in some casualties.

Although the Arab League Council of Ministers passed a resolution last week, calling for a ceasefire between the warring factions in Lebanon starting from April 28, conflicts between the Christian forces led by Aoun and the Muslim militias supported by Syria have continued in the past few days.

The Muslim militias declared that their condition for a ceasefire is the deployment of the Arab ceasefire monitoring forces along the front lines of both sides in Beirut and the eastern mountain areas. They also demand that these forces be stationed in the port of Jounieh and the ancient city of Byblos to prevent Iraqi ships from supplying weapons to Aoun's forces.

　　黎巴嫩又起战火
    新华社贝鲁特５月６日电在阿拉伯联盟呼吁下实行了９天不稳定停火的黎巴嫩，今天下午又发生了基督教政府军同叙利亚支持的穆斯林社会进步党民兵的交火。
    在阿什拉菲耶等一些沿海地区和贝鲁特港口等地，双方大炮和火箭的轰击造成了一些人员伤亡。
    尽管阿盟部长理事会上周通过决议，要求从４月２８日起黎巴嫩交战双方实行停火，但在过去几天里，以奥恩为首的基督教军队同叙利亚支持的穆斯林武装之间仍不断发生冲突。
    穆斯林民兵宣布，他们的停火条件是，阿拉伯停火监督部队部署在贝鲁特双方交战前线和东部山区。他们还要求这支部队部署在朱尼耶港和古城比布鲁斯，以防止伊拉克船向奥恩的部队供应武器。
