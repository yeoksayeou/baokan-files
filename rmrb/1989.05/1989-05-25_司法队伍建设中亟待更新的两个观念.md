The current task of improving the quality of judicial personnel and optimizing the structure of the judicial team is crucial for strengthening socialist legal systems. We believe that while institutional measures are important, updating the concepts in judicial team building is even more urgent. The term "judicial organs" in this article primarily refers to courts and procuratorates, as they have unique characteristics compared to other departments. Therefore, this article mainly discusses issues in the construction of the "two courts."

**Establishing the New Concept of Equally Emphasizing Political and Professional Qualities**

For a long time, we have regarded judicial personnel as those who "hold the knife and handle," who are fighters in the struggle against the enemy. Consequently, in the selection, appointment, and evaluation of judicial personnel, we often emphasize political qualities while neglecting or even ignoring professional qualities. The formation of this concept has historical reasons. In the early days of the founding of the nation, class struggles were the primary domestic contradiction, and suppressing the enemy's resistance and consolidating the newly established people's regime were the central tasks of judicial organs. In the life-and-death struggle of class conflict, the survival of the newly established people's regime was the overriding issue. Therefore, the historical requirement for judicial personnel was that they had a firm stance in the struggle against the enemy, were loyal to the party, and could accurately and decisively strike the enemy according to flexible and changing anti-enemy policies.

However, after the basic completion of socialist transformation, in a society where class struggles are no longer the primary domestic contradiction, we should update the past concept of "taking class struggle as the key link" and adapt to the needs of socialist modernization. Otherwise, it will cause great harm to the construction of socialist legal systems in our country.

Firstly, this concept is contrary to the changes in the main functions of our country's judicial organs. In the current stage, although judicial organs still have the function of dictatorship, the main function of dictatorship is no longer the primary function of judicial organs. Instead, it has shifted from dictating over the enemy to legally mediating and resolving various contradictions among the people. Specifically, the main functions of judicial organs are as follows: (1) Legally mediating and resolving conflicts and contradictions between citizens, between citizens and legal entities, and between legal entities; (2) Legally mediating and resolving conflicts and contradictions between citizens, legal entities, and state organs and their personnel; (3) Legally mediating and resolving conflicts and contradictions between different interest groups in society; (4) Legally punishing and educating criminals among the people; (5) Legally punishing bureaucratism and illegal acts of privilege.

The change in the main functions of judicial organs will inevitably impose new requirements on the quality of judicial personnel, that is, judicial personnel must not only have good political qualities but also have high legal qualities. Obviously, the previous concept of emphasizing political qualities while neglecting professional qualities is contrary to this requirement.

Secondly, this concept is an important cause of the phenomena of not enforcing the law and wrongful judgments. For a long time, the concept of judicial team building that emphasizes political qualities while neglecting professional qualities has had many adverse effects on the legal consciousness of judicial personnel. In practice, this is mainly manifested in the following ways: (1) Replacing legal standards with political standards. Due to the long-term influence of "leftist" ideology, some judicial personnel often use the concept of enemy situation to guide judicial work. They treat the defendant as a criminal and the criminal as an enemy, thus not treating the defendant as a citizen. (2) Emphasizing responsibility to superiors while neglecting responsibility to the law. Subordinates obeying superiors is a common rule in government operations. However, judicial work is different from government work. Judicial personnel should be responsible to the law and act according to the law. However, the current situation is that some judicial personnel, due to their poor professional qualities and weak rule of law consciousness, often only believe in power, while the law is virtually non-existent. (3) Emphasizing substantive law while neglecting procedural law. In the eyes of some comrades, procedural law is often a "code of conduct" that restricts actions. They believe that as long as the facts of a case are clarified and the application of the law is accurate, it is sufficient. In fact, in modern society, there is no litigation without law, and adhering to legal procedures should be the first principle of law-abiding behavior. However, in reality, it is precisely because of this consciousness that examples of violating legal procedures are common.

Thirdly, this concept is an important obstacle to the reform of our country's judicial system. The independence of judicial organs in exercising their powers according to law is a necessary trend in the development of the world's judicial system and an important achievement in human understanding of the phenomenon of power. The independence of judges, together with the independence of courts, has been approved by the constitutions of various countries as a complete content of judicial independence. To achieve this, it is first necessary to require judges to have high legal literacy and legal expertise. However, looking at the current situation of our country's judicial team, the quality of judges is far from what is required for judicial independence, and this situation has seriously hindered the progress of our country's judicial system reform.

Therefore, in the future construction of the judicial team, we must break away from the old concept of emphasizing political qualities while neglecting professional qualities and establish the new concept of equally emphasizing political and professional qualities.

**Establishing the New Concept of Judicial Personnel Being Both State Employees and Professional Technicians**

For a long time, due to the lack of implementation of the civil servant system, we have formed the concept that judicial personnel, like other state employees, are state cadres. Under the guidance of this concept, in practice, we often use administrative ranks to determine the status of judicial personnel and use the methods of managing administrative cadres to manage judicial personnel.

In practice, this concept is also harmful.

Theoretically, it is actually a reflection of the merger of administration and adjudication in our country's feudal society. In modern society, emphasizing division of labor and mutual restraint is a necessary trend in social development. Therefore, after entering a socialist society, it is inconsistent with the nature of our country to continue to use the backward management system of feudalism.

In practice, this concept further aggravates the low quality of our country's judicial team. Since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee of the Party, in order to meet the needs of strengthening legal system construction, the judicial department, as a department that needs to be expanded, has been strengthened. However, the reality is that judicial organs often become a "placement" for personnel from streamlined state organs and demobilized military personnel. Moreover, because these comrades originally had high ranks, they naturally had to be arranged to hold certain positions after coming to the judicial organs. While those who have received systematic training in legal professional undergraduate and graduate programs find it difficult to enter judicial organs, and those who are already working in judicial organs and have high professional levels also have to leave judicial organs due to lack of promotion prospects. Undoubtedly, this will inevitably affect the quality of our country's judicial team.

We believe that although judicial personnel are state employees, they are not "state cadres" in the current sense, nor are they "civil servants" in the original sense. Instead, they should be professional technicians, and we should manage them in the same way as other professional technicians. Therefore, the professional titles of judicial personnel should be a comprehensive reflection of their true abilities, professional levels, etc., rather than the application of "ranks."

Firstly, from the nature of the activities of judicial organs, it is a highly professional technical work. In Western countries, judicial work is often referred to as an art. This is because judicial activities are not simply the application of legal provisions, but rather the accurate application of the same legal standards to thousands of different cases based on the clarification of facts, and making legal and reasonable judgments. Without profound legal expertise and social knowledge, this work is difficult to accomplish. In our country, the professional requirements for judicial work are even more urgent, especially since the social, political, and economic situations in various regions of our country are quite different, and national legislation can only make unified and principled provisions. This gives judicial personnel a relatively large "discretionary power" in the application of laws. In this way, to ensure the uniform implementation of national laws, it is required that our country's judicial personnel not only be familiar with legal provisions but more importantly, be proficient in legal principles. To achieve this, it is necessary for judicial personnel who have received standardized, systematic, and strict legal training to engage in judicial work.

Secondly, from the perspective of the judge system in various countries, most countries regard judges as professional personnel and have set relatively strict conditions for appointment and qualifications. They stipulate that to be a judge, one must have at least a regular law school degree, have passed the lawyer qualification examination, and have practiced law for several years before being eligible for appointment as a judge. It is precisely because of these regulations in Western countries that judges have a high social status and become respected professions. It is also because of this that judges in Western countries play an irreplaceable role in maintaining social stability, promoting legal research, and maintaining the dignity of the legal system.

Therefore, in the construction of the judicial team, we must also break away from the concept that judicial personnel are cadres and establish the new concept that judicial personnel are both state employees and professional technicians.

　　司法队伍建设中亟待更新的两个观念
    甘藏春　白莲湘
    当前，提高司法人员的素质，优化司法队伍的结构，已经成为加强社会主义法制的一项紧迫任务。我们认为，提高司法人员的素质、优化司法队伍的结构，在制度上采取各种措施固然重要，但更新司法队伍建设的观念则更为迫切。本文所称的“司法机关”，主要指法院和检察院，因为它们相对于其它部门而言，还有其特殊性。所以，本文所讨论的主要是“两院”建设中的问题。
  确立政治素质与业务素质同时并重的新观念
    长期以来，我们习惯于将司法人员看作“掌刀把子”的人，是对敌人进行专政的战士。因而，在司法人员的选拔、任用、考核上往往只强调司法人员的政治素质，而轻视甚至忽略司法人员的业务素质。这种观念的形成，是有历史原因的。在建国初期，阶级矛盾是国内的主要矛盾，镇压敌人的反抗，巩固新生的人民政权，是司法机关的中心任务。在你死我活的阶级斗争环境中，新生的人民政权的生死存亡是压倒一切的中心问题，因而历史要求司法人员的唯一标准就是对敌斗争立场坚定，对党忠诚，能够依照灵活多变的对敌斗争政策，稳准狠地打击敌人。
    但在社会主义改造基本完成之后，在阶级矛盾已经不再是国内的主要矛盾的社会条件下，应当更新过去那种“以阶级斗争为纲”的观念而适应社会主义现代化的需要，否则对于我国的社会主义法制建设将会造成很大的危害。
    首先，这种观念是与我国司法机关的主要职能的变化相悖的。在现阶段，由于阶级矛盾不再是国内的主要矛盾，尽管司法机关仍然具有专政的职能。但是，从总体意义上讲，专政职能已经不再是司法机关的主要职能，它的主要职能已由对敌人专政转化为依法调停处理人民内部的各种矛盾。具体说来，司法机关的这种职能主要表现在：（１）依法调停处理公民个人之间、公民与法人之间、法人与法人之间的冲突和矛盾；（２）依法调停和处理公民、法人与国家机关及其工作人员之间的冲突和矛盾；（３）依法调停处理社会中不同的利益群体之间的冲突和矛盾；（４）依法惩处和教育人民中的犯罪分子；（５）依法惩罚官僚主义和恃仗特权的不法行为。司法机关主要职能的变化，必然对司法人员的素质提出新的要求，即司法人员不仅要有较好的政治素质，而且还必须同时具备较高的法律素质。很显然，上述那种只重视政治素质而轻视业务素质的观念是与这一要求相悖的。
    其次，这种观念是造成有法不依、枉法裁判现象的重要原因。长期来，只重视政治素质轻视业务素质的司法队伍建设的观念，给司法人员的执法意识产生了许多不良的影响。从实践中看，主要表现在：（１）以政治标准代替法律标准。由于长期受“左”的思想的影响，部分司法人员往往以敌情观念来指导审判工作，他们把被告当罪犯，将罪犯当敌人，从而不把被告看作公民加以对待。（２）只注重对上级负责而忽略对法律负责。下级服从上级是政府运行的一条通则，但是，司法工作不同于政府工作，对法律负责、依法行事应当是司法人员的应有之义。但现在的情况是，某些司法人员由于业务素质较差，法治观念差，他们往往只信奉权力，而法律形同虚设。（３）重实体法而轻程序法。在某些同志看来，程序法往往是束缚手脚的“清规戒律”，一个案件只要事实弄清了，适用法律准确了就可以。其实，在现代社会，没有诉讼就没有法，遵守法定程序应是守法的第一要义。但在现实中，正是由于存在这种意识，违反法律程序的实例则屡见不鲜。
    第三，这种观念是妨碍我国司法体制改革的一个重要障碍。司法机关依法独立行使职权，是当代世界司法体制发展的必然趋势，也是人类在对权力现象的深入认识上所取得的一项重要成果。而法官独立则同法院独立一起作为司法独立的一项完整内容得到了各国宪法的首肯。要做到这一点，首先就要求法官具有较高的法律素养和法学造诣。但是，就我国司法队伍的现状来看，与法官独立所要求的法官素质相差甚远，这种状况已严重地阻碍了我国司法体制改革的进行。
    因此，在今后司法队伍的建设上我们必须破除只重政治素质而轻视业务素质的旧观念，确立政治素质与业务素质同时并重的新观念。
  确立司法人员既是国家工作人员，又是专业技术人员的新观念
    长期以来，由于公务员制度没有实行，因而我们还形成了这样的观念：司法人员同其它国家工作人员一样，都属国家干部。在这种观念指导下，在实践上，我们往往用行政级别来确定司法人员的地位，用管理行政干部的方法来管理司法人员。
    实践证明这种观念同样是有害的。
    从理论上看，它实际上是我国封建社会行审（即行政与审判）合一制度的反映。在现代社会，强调分工制约是社会发展的必然趋势，因此，在进入社会主义社会之后，仍然套用封建的落后的管理制度，是与我们国家的本质不相符合的。
    从实践看，这种观念进一步加剧了我国司法队伍素质低下的状况。从党的十一届三中全会以来，为了适应加强法制建设的需要，司法部门作为需要扩充的机关得到了加强。但是，现实的情况是，司法机关往往成为安置国家机构精简人员和安置部队转业干部的“安置所”。而且，由于这些同志原有的级别较高，因此，来到司法机关之后还理所当然地要安排担任一定的职务。而那些受过正规系统培养的法律专业本科生、研究生则难以进入司法机关，并且已在司法机关工作的、业务水平较高的同志也因为提职无望而不得不离开司法机关。无疑，这就必然影响我国司法队伍的素质。
    我们认为，司法人员虽然是国家工作人员，但是，他们不仅不是现在意义上的“国家干部”，而且也不是本来意义上的“公务员”，相反，他应该是专业技术人员，我们应当像管理其他专业技术人员那样来进行管理。因此，司法人员的职称也应是他们真才实学、业务水平等的综合反映，而不应该是“级别”的套用。
    首先，从司法机关的活动性质来看，它是一项专业性极强的技术工作。在西方国家，往往有人将司法工作称为一门艺术。这是因为，司法活动不仅仅是简单地引用法律条文，而是要在查清事实的基础上，把同一的法律标准准确适用于千差万别的个案中去，并作出合法合理的判决，如果没有渊博的法学造诣和社会知识，这一工作是难以胜任的。在我国，对司法工作的专业性要求就更为迫切，特别是我国各地社会政治经济情况差别很大，而国家的立法只能作统一的、原则性的规定，这就给司法人员适用法律提供了较大的“自由裁量权”，这样，要使国家法律得到统一实施，就要求我国司法人员不仅要熟悉法律条文，更重要的是精于法理。要做到这一点，就必须由接受过正规化的、系统的、严格的法律训练的司法人员来从事司法工作。
    其次，从世界各国的法官制度来看，大多数国家都把法官看作专业人员，规定了较为严格的任职条件和资格。它们规定，作为法官至少要有正规法学院的学位，经过了律师资格考试，同时从事了若干年的律师实务之后，才可选任法官。正因为西方国家的这些规定，使得法官具有崇高的社会地位，成为受人尊敬的职业。也正因为如此，西方国家的法官在维护社会的安定，促进法学研究，维护法制尊严方面起着不可替代的作用。
    因此，在司法队伍的建设上，我们还必须破除司法人员是干部的观念，确立司法人员既是国家工作人员，又是专业技术人员的新观念。
