The flood season is approaching, and it is urgent to repair this section of the road.

The Xuefeng Reservoir in our city often faces dangerous situations during the flood season. The city frequently organizes personnel to go to the reservoir to protect the dam and handle emergencies. However, on the 10-kilometer stretch of the Yan Mountain Road leading to this reservoir, a landslide occurred in 1985, burying over 100 meters of the road with more than 4 meters of mud and rocks, which have not been cleared to this day. During rainy days, the road surface becomes soft and muddy, often causing traffic disruptions. On August 13 last year, our city experienced a heavy downpour. More than a hundred vehicles and thousands of people heading to the reservoir to protect the dam were blocked on this section of the road and had to take a detour, walking more than 10 kilometers to reach the reservoir. Because vehicles could not pass, logistics were hindered, and emergency supplies and daily necessities could not be delivered in time. The dam protection personnel had to work on empty stomachs, taking turns using the tools.

This year's flood season is approaching, and the accumulated debris on this section of the road remains untouched. We appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to repair this section of the road as soon as possible.

　　汛期来临以前尽快修复这段公路
    我市薛峰水库在汛期时常出现险情，市里经常组织人员上水库护坝抢险。但是，在通往这个水库的延山公路１０公里处，因１９８５年山体滑坡塌方，１００多米路面上堆积了４米多高的泥沙和石块，至今没有清除。一遇雨天，路面泡软，交通经常中断。去年８月１３日，我市下了特大暴雨，护坝的百十辆汽车、数千名人员被挡在这段路上，只得绕道步行１０多公里赶往水库。由于车辆不能通过，后勤受阻，抢险物资和生活物品不能及时运到，护坝人员只好空着肚子，轮换使用工具劳动。
    今年汛期又将来临，而这段公路上的多年堆积物还原封未动。呼吁有关部门采取措施，尽快修复这段公路。
