A patient who had been in a coma for 73 days due to severe carbon monoxide poisoning has recently regained full consciousness thanks to the dedicated treatment by medical staff at the Dalian Railway Hospital. Experts say this is a rare occurrence in the country.

According to the *Dalian Daily*, on the evening of December 21 last year, worker Xiu Shucui from the Dalian Crane Factory suffered carbon monoxide poisoning and went into shock. She was later transferred to the Dalian Railway Hospital, where she was in a deep coma. Doctors administered five courses of treatment. A miracle occurred: after 73 days in a coma, Xiu Shucui regained consciousness and could respond to simple questions and control her bowel and bladder functions. After 100 days, her consciousness fully recovered, her thinking was clear, and her responses were logical.
