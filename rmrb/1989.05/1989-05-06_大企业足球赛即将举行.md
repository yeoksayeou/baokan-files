The 16 football teams from major enterprises across the country will gather in Tianjin to participate in the "Coca-Cola Cup" 3rd National Major Enterprises Football Tournament, which begins on May 12. This event is a showcase and inspection of enterprises running high-level sports teams, and it will further promote the development of workers' sports.

More than 40 teams applied to participate in this competition, with enthusiastic sign-ups. However, due to limited conditions, only 16 teams were finally selected to compete. Even so, the scale of this tournament exceeds that of the final round of the National Workers' Sports Games. The technical level of the participating teams has also significantly improved, and the matches will be more exciting than in the previous two editions. The champion team of this tournament will participate in the national football second-tier league next year. Additionally, the National Major Enterprises Football Tournament will highly value sportsmanship and emphasize the construction of spiritual civilization.

　　大企业足球赛即将举行
    本报讯  全国１６支大型企业的足球队即将汇聚天津，参加从５月１２日开始的“万事可乐杯”第３届全国大企业足球赛。这是一次对企业办高水平运动队的宣传和检阅，将进一步推动职工体育运动的开展。
    要求参加这次比赛的有４０多个队，报名十分踊跃，但由于条件有限，最后只确定１６个队参赛。即便这样，其规模也超过了全国工人运动会决赛。各队技术水平也有较大提高，打得会比上两届更好看。这次比赛产生的冠军队将参加明年全国足球乙级队联赛，另外，全国大企业足球赛将会高度重视赛风，抓好精神文明建设。
