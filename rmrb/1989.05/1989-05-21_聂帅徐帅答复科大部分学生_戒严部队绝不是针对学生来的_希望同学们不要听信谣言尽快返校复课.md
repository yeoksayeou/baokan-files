Today at 7 PM, 11 students from the University of Science and Technology, including Zhu Zhongzhi and Luo Zhigang, visited the residence of Marshal Nie Rongzhen. They requested a meeting with Marshal Nie and handed over a letter. The letter stated: "Dear Marshal Nie, this afternoon, Li Peng chaired a meeting and made four decisions: first, to define this student patriotic movement as a rebellion; second, to suppress the 200,000 students in Tiananmen Square within 20 days; third, to clear out the prisons in the capital; fourth, all sanitation workers will start work at 5 AM tomorrow to clean Tiananmen Square. The news is true, the troops have been deployed, and the situation is extremely urgent. We hope that Marshal Nie will consider the lives of the 200 million citizens and 200,000 students in Tiananmen Square, speak out for justice, and express your stance. We are waiting for you outside! If possible, please go to Tiananmen Square tonight to visit the masses and students."

Marshal Nie responded: "First, these four points are purely rumors; please do not believe them. Second, the military has come to Beijing to implement martial law, solely to maintain social order and stability in the capital. We hope that students will assist the People's Liberation Army in this work. Third, we hope that students, for the sake of national dignity, the order of the capital, the lives of citizens, and their own health and studies, will quickly withdraw from Tiananmen Square. We hope that students from the University of Science and Technology will take the lead and return to school to resume classes."

Tonight at around 9 PM, 7 students from the University of Science and Technology visited the residence of Marshal Xu Xiangqian. The staff at Marshal Xu's residence received them. The student representative said that the military is planning to suppress the students, and there may be a bloody incident tonight. They requested that Marshal Xu say something. The staff at Marshal Xu's residence replied that the troops are carrying out martial law to restore normal order in the capital and maintain a stable and united situation. They are not targeting the students. The soldiers will do everything possible to avoid a bloody incident and hope that you do not believe the rumors. We hope that students will quickly return to school and resume classes, and cooperate with the government to calm the situation with a rational attitude.
