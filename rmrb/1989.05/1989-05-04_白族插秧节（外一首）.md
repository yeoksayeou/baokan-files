Here, transplanting rice seedlings requires a transplanting festival,
Labor and solemnity combined in a festival,
Here, transplanting rice seedlings requires singing transplanting songs,
Labor and beautiful art combined.
While transplanting, while singing,
Working hard is also enjoying,
There is accompaniment and direction,
The rice official beats the drum, running through the fields.
The faster the drum beats, the faster the seedlings are transplanted,
Fast and slow in rhythm,
If someone transplants slowly, he beats the drum fiercely at them,
If the beat is wrong, they get splashed with water.

The rice fields are lively and bustling,
The rice fields are lively and energetic,
No one feels tired, no one wants to rest,
Culture and grain are harvested together.
It is a reenactment of human development history,
It is a revival of the cultural source,
Labor is not dull and boring,
Quickly follow the drumbeat to break free from the shackles of alienation.

	Stone Forest Tour
	The stone forest stands like a real forest,
	Branches and leaves are lush,
	The forest shade is deep.
	The paths are steep and slippery,
	The gaps are deep and mysterious,
	Like entering a primeval forest,
	Like walking into a maze.
	Unable to distinguish north from south,
	Unable to tell if it's sunny or overcast,
	Walking without a way out,
	Pushing through without getting in.

	If you lose your soul, let it be lost,
	If you lose your mind, let it be lost,
	If you don't get lost, you won't come in,
	If you're not infatuated, you won't be truly in love.
	If the scenery doesn't end, it won't be a wonderful view,
	If the art doesn't end, it won't be inspiring,
	The mysterious world is the enchanting forest,
	If you want to enter, you'll be lost and lose your soul.

　　白族插秧节
    （外一首）
    苗得雨
    这里插秧要过插秧节，
    劳动与严肃的节日结合，
    这里插秧要唱插秧歌，
    劳动与动听的艺术结合。
    一边插秧一边唱，
    尽情劳动也是尽情乐，
    还有伴奏与指挥，
    秧官敲锣满田里奔波。
    锣敲多快，秧插多快，
    快快慢慢合节拍，
    谁插慢了他向谁猛敲，
    敲错了点又要挨水泼。　
    秧田里热热闹闹，
    秧田里风风火火，
    没人叫累，没人愿歇，
    文化和谷物一同收获。
    是人类发展史的再现，
    是文化源泉的复活，
    劳动本不是枯燥无味，
    快应和锣声挣脱异化的绳索。
    　　　　石林游
    石头立成的林，
    也像真的林，
    枝叶茂密，
    林荫沉沉。
    阶险道滑，
    间隙幽深，
    像进入原始森林，
    像走进迷魂阵。
    不辨南北，
    不知晴阴，
    走投无路地走，
    钻不进地进。　
    失魄就失魄，
    迷魂就迷魂，
    不为迷不会进来，
    情不痴不为情真。
    景不绝不为佳境，
    艺不绝不会传神，
    神秘世界就是迷人的林，
    愿意走进就为落魄丢魂。
