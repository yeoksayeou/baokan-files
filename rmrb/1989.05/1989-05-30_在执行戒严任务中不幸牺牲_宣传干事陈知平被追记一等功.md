A solemn assembly was held by a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on May 29 to posthumously award the first-class merit to Chen Zhiping, an officer who sacrificed his life while executing martial law duties. At the meeting, Liu Zhenhua, the Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region, highly commended Chen Zhiping's firm stance and clear distinction between right and wrong in the struggle to quell the turmoil.

Chen Zhiping, a captain, was the propaganda officer of a certain unit. His unit was responsible for implementing martial law in parts of Beijing.

On the morning of May 23, the unit was ordered to move to a designated assembly point. Chen Zhiping was engaged in persuading students and the public, maintaining order at the scene, and ensuring the passage of vehicles when he was pushed down under a transport vehicle's wheel, resulting in severe injuries. Despite rescue efforts, he unfortunately succumbed to his injuries.

Chen Zhiping was an outstanding political officer and model Communist Party member of the unit. During the execution of martial law duties, he worked tirelessly, understanding the unit's morale, conducting propaganda, and patiently persuading and explaining to students and the public. He frequently engaged in dialogues with students and the public, addressing issues, and refuting rumors circulating in society. Over several days, he remained active within the unit, barely getting any sleep or proper meals, and his voice became hoarse from constant speaking.
