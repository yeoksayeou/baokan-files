The Milky Way, composed of 200 billion stars, has long been believed to have a diameter of approximately 100,000 light-years. This figure was determined based on the brightness of stars. Recently, scientists at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in the United States used new technologies to recalculate the distances in the universe based on the already determined positions of stars in the Milky Way. According to their calculations, the diameter of the Milky Way is 70,000 light-years, nearly one-third less than the previously determined value. Previously, it was thought that the Sun is located 33,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way. Now, the astrophysicists at the Smithsonian have confirmed that the Sun is 23,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way. Scientists have also recalculated the speed at which the Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way: previously thought to be 220,000 kilometers per second, the newly determined speed is 30,000 kilometers per second slower than the previously believed speed.

　　最新测算结果：
    银行系直径只七万光年
    由２０００亿颗恒星汇聚而成的银河系，其直径历来被认为是１０万光年左右。这一数据是根据恒星的亮度确定的。最近，美国史密松天体物理台的科学家采用新技术，根据银河系中已经测定的点位，重新测量了宇宙间的距离。按他们的计算，银河系的直径是７万光年，比原来测定的数值几乎要少１／３。以前认为，太阳位于距银河系中心３．３万光年处。现在，史密松的天体物理学家们确认，太阳距银河系中心距离为２．３万光年。科学家们还重新测定了太阳围绕银河系中心旋转的速度：以前认为是每秒２２万公里，重新测定的结果比以前认为的速度每秒少了３万公里。
