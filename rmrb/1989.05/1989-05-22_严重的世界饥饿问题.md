During the 15th Ministerial Meeting of the United Nations World Food Council in Cairo, our correspondent in Rome, Luo Jinbiao, interviewed the Director of the Policy Coordination and External Relations Department, Mr. A. V. Nagu, to discuss the severe hunger problems that persist in the world today and the current state of global food conditions.

Billions Starving—Causes for Concern

Director Nagu pointed out that in the 1980s, the number of people starving in the world increased fivefold compared to a decade earlier. In 1984, the number of malnourished children exceeded that of 1975. Today, famine still threatens the lives of billions, and malnutrition continues to cause immense suffering and death. Just in the first half of the 1980s, the total number of starving people reached 512 million. Due to the lack of significant improvement in the global food and economic environment, the number of starving people in 1989 is expected to increase by about 40 million.

The distribution of the world's starving population shows that the number of starving people in Africa is growing the fastest, while the majority of malnourished people in Asia account for more than half of the world's total. Within each region, most of the starving people are concentrated in a few countries. Three-quarters of Asia's starving population are in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Although China has reduced its number of starving people to about 6% of its total population, it still accounts for 15% of Asia's starving population.

Two-thirds of Africa's starving population are in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Zaire, Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and Mozambique. In Ethiopia, Zaire, Uganda, Mozambique, Zambia, Chad, and Somalia, more than 40% of the population is malnourished. The vast majority of the world's starving people live in rural areas, with the proportion reaching 80-90% in Asia and Africa, 70% in the Near East, and 60% in Latin America. Children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and the elderly are the most vulnerable. It is estimated that every year, 14 million children under the age of five die from malnutrition, diarrhea, and infectious diseases.

The causes of hunger are multifaceted: underdevelopment and poverty; unequal distribution of food and wealth within countries or between countries. Tragically, many famines are caused by conflicts or wars. Indeed, poor agricultural practices and the reliance of farmers on wood for fuel have led to ecological degradation, creating the danger of famine in developing countries. Many so-called "natural disasters," such as droughts and floods, are ultimately man-made.

Global Food Situation—Rapid Changes

Director Nagu said that due to droughts in North America and natural disasters in other regions, the world's grain reserves are expected to decrease to 275 million tons in the 1988/89 season, a reduction of about 28% from the previous year. In terms of the ratio to consumption, this is the lowest level since the world food crisis of 1972-1974. International grain market prices have surged significantly, with wheat prices rising by more than 40% and corn prices by nearly two-thirds compared to a year ago. This situation has raised some important issues regarding global food security.

First, the recent price increases will directly affect the food import expenditures of developing countries. If developing countries want to maintain their pre-price-increase import levels, they will need to spend an additional $2.5 billion on wheat alone this year.

Second, the amount of food aid may decrease in the short term due to price increases. Compared to the previous year, it is estimated that the amount of grain aid in the 1988/89 season will decrease by one-quarter, with two-thirds of the reduction being for low-income food-deficit countries.

Third, the Food and Agriculture Organization believes that grain production needs to increase by an unprecedented 200 million tons (12%) in 1989 to restore the global food consumption trend in the 1989/90 season and replenish reserves to the minimum level required for global food security. However, due to unfavorable climates in some parts of the world, initial indications suggest that achieving the required increase in production is becoming less likely.

Fourth, there are concerns that the current food situation may slow down the agricultural policy reforms aimed at reducing surpluses in developed countries. The OECD predicts that in the next few years, grain supply will again exceed demand, leading to increased reserves and falling prices, and the structural imbalance of the global food system will continue.

An Imbalanced Global Food System—Must Be Changed

Director Nagu particularly pointed out that in the early 1980s, while the number of starving people was increasing, global grain reserves reached record levels. This clearly shows that hunger is not the result of global food shortages. So far, the surplus grain in developed countries has not been used to supply the starving people in developing countries, and this will not change in the future. If current policies are not fundamentally changed, even if the global economy experiences sustained, significant growth in the coming decades, hunger will not be eliminated or reduced. If no action is taken now, the number of hungry people will increase, and the cost of effective action will greatly increase.

　　严重的世界饥饿问题
    在联合国世界粮食理事会第１５届部长级会议在开罗召开之际，本报驻罗马记者罗晋标采访了理事会政策协调和对外关系司司长阿·维·纳奎先生，请他介绍了当今世界上严重存在着的饥饿问题和世界粮食形势的现状。
    　　　　亿万人挨饿——令人担忧
    纳奎司长指出，８０年代，世界挨饿人数比１０年前增加了５倍，１９８４年营养不良的儿童，比１９７５年的人数多。今天，饥荒仍威胁着亿万人的生命，特种营养病继续使人们遭受极大的苦难和死亡。仅８０年代上半期，饥民总数已达５．１２亿。由于世界粮食和经济环境没有明显好转，１９８９年饥民队伍可能增加４０００万左右。
    世界饥民的分布情况是，非洲饥民人数增长速度最快，亚洲营养不足的人数占世界总数的大半。在各区域内，大部分饥民集中在少数几个国家。３／４的亚洲饥民集中在孟加拉、不丹、印度、马尔代夫、尼泊尔、巴基斯坦和斯里兰卡７个南亚国家。中国尽管把其饥民人数减少到占总人口的６％左右，但仍占亚洲饥民总数的１５％。
    ２／３的非洲饥民集中在埃塞俄比亚、尼日利亚、扎伊尔、坦桑尼亚、肯尼亚、乌干达和莫桑比克。在埃塞俄比亚、扎伊尔、乌干达、莫桑比克、赞比亚、乍得和索马里，４０％以上的人口营养不足。世界上绝大多数饥民生活在农村，在亚洲和非洲其比例达８０—９０％，近东地区和拉美，分别为７０％和６０％。儿童、孕妇、哺乳母亲和老年人最易受害，据估计每年有１４００万５岁以下的儿童死于营养不良、腹泻和传染病。
    造成饥饿的原因是多方面的：不发达和贫困；粮食和财富在国内或各国间分配不均……可悲的是，许多饥荒是由于冲突或战争造成的。诚然，不好的农业耕作习惯和农民全靠木材作燃料所造成的生态破坏，也使发展中国家产生了饥荒的危险。许多所谓“自然灾害”，诸如旱灾和水灾，归根结底是人为的结果。
    　　　　全球粮食形势——急剧变化
    纳奎司长说，由于北美干旱和其他地区的自然灾害，预计１９８８／８９年世界谷物库存将减少到２．７５亿吨，比前一年降低约２８％，就其与消费的比例而言，这是１９７２年至１９７４年世界粮食危机以来的最低水平。国际粮食市场价格大幅度上涨，小麦价格比一年前上涨４０％以上，玉米价格上涨近２／３。这种情况引起了世界粮食安全的一些重要问题。
    第一，最近的涨价将直接影响发展中国家粮食进口的支出。如果发展中国家要维持其涨价前的进口量，仅小麦一项今年就要多支出２５亿美元。
    第二，粮援数量近期内可能因涨价而减少。与前一年相比，预计１９８８／８９年谷物的粮援量将减少１／４，据估计２／３的减少量是对低收入缺粮国的。
    第三，粮农组织认为，１９８９年谷物产量需空前增加２亿吨（１２％），方能在１９８９／９０年恢复世界粮食消费趋势，把库存补充到世界粮食安全所需的起码数量。但由于世界一些地区气候不利，初步迹象表明，实现所要求的增产可能性缩小。
    第四，有人担心当前的粮食形势可能会使发达国家放慢旨在减少生产过剩的农业政策改革进程。经合组织预测，在今后几年中，谷物供应将再次大于需求，从而使库存增加，价格下跌，世界粮食体系的结构继续不平衡。
    　　　　不平衡的世界粮食体系——必须改变
    纳奎司长特别指出，８０年代初期，在饥民人数不断增加之时，世界粮食库存却达到创纪录水平。这清楚地说明，饥饿不是全球粮食供应不足导致的结果。到目前为止，发达国家剩余的粮食没有用来供应发展中国家的饥民，而且将来也不会这样做。如果不从根本上改变当前的政策，即使今后几十年世界经济出现持续的大幅度增长，饥饿现象仍不会被消灭或减少。如果现在不采取行动，饥饿人数将增长，有效行动的费用将大大增加。
