	U.S. Secretary of Defense Says NATO Strategic Goals Unharmed

	BEIJING, May 26 -- A report from our correspondent in Rome, Luo Jinbiao: On the eve of U.S. President Bush's visit to Europe, Italian TV Channel 1 aired an interview with U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney regarding the issue of updating short-range nuclear missiles.

	When asked by the reporter if he was concerned about the differences of opinion between the U.S. and the Federal Republic of Germany on major issues such as tactical missiles, Cheney responded, "I am always concerned when there are differing views on major issues within the alliance. However, it is not unusual for there to be conflicts, and the fundamental strategic goals remain unharmed. This is still an important issue that we need to continue to work on."

	When the reporter mentioned that many people in Europe do not understand why short-range nuclear missiles are being updated at this time, Cheney said, "So far, we have only seen statements of intent from Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders, but we have not seen any significant changes in their offensive capabilities. Perhaps changes are happening, and things may change. What is certain is that there is still a Soviet military superiority in Europe, with conventional weapons aimed at the West. If we change our stance, not moving forward with a unified policy among allies, not moving forward with the idea of updating our short-range nuclear weapons in Europe, that would be a serious mistake. As the U.S. Secretary of Defense, I must be concerned about today's military capabilities. I believe that NATO should maintain its military strength in anticipation of changes in the situation."

	When asked if there is significant pressure, especially from the Bush administration, to change the Soviet Union through democracy and to change everything in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, and if this were to happen, whether NATO would still have a reason to exist, Cheney replied, "Of course, if Soviet troops truly withdraw from Eastern Europe, then the military purpose for which NATO was established would change."

　　美国防部长对意大利记者说
    北约战略目标未受损害
    本报罗马５月２６日电  记者罗晋标报道：５月２５日晚，在美国总统布什出访欧洲的前夕，意大利电视１台新闻节目播放了该台记者就短程核导弹更新问题对美国国防部长切尼的采访。
    当记者问切尼部长对美国与联邦德国在战术导弹这一类重大问题上意见分歧是否担心时，切尼答称，在联盟内重大问题上观点不同时我总是担心的，但是存在矛盾并不奇怪，根本战略目标仍然未受损害，尽管这也是我们要继续努力解决的一个重要问题。
    当记者说到在欧洲许多人不明白为什么在现在这个时候更新短程核导弹时，切尼部长说，至今只有戈尔巴乔夫和其他苏联领导人方面的意向性声明，而我们并没有看到他们的进攻能力方面的任何显著变化，也许正在做，事情可能变化。肯定的是，目前在欧洲还存在苏联的压倒的军事优势，矛头指向西方的常规武器这一事实。如果我们方面改变态度，不是以盟国之间取得一致的政策而前进，不是以例如更新我们在欧洲的短程核武器的思想而前进，那将会是一个重大错误。作为美国国防部长，我应当为今天的军事能力而担心。我认为，北约在军事上应当保持其力量，以待事态变化。
    当记者问，有个很大压力，特别是来自布什政府方面，要苏联通过民主而改变其社会，使苏联和东欧国家改变一切，你认为这一切将可能发生吗？如果发生，你认为北约还有理由继续存在吗？切尼部长回答说，当然，如果苏联军队真正从东欧撤走，到那时，北约建立时候的那种军事目的就改变了。
