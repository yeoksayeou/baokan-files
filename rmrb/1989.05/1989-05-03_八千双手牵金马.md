After our factory won the 1988 National Enterprise Management Excellence Award, some colleagues asked me, "Old Li, how did you manage to bring the golden horse into the factory?" I replied, "By relying on the more than 8,000 employees of the entire factory to carry out standardized group management."

In the past, managing the enterprise was a matter of tightening up for a while and then relaxing, leading to a cycle of laxity. Employees called this the "gust of wind" approach. In 1986, to strictly enforce labor and technological discipline, the factory formulated a set of inspection, assessment, and reward-punishment systems, which initially proved effective. Later, however, a backlash emerged among the employees. When leaders inspected the upstream processes, the downstream processes quickly spread the "feathered message." Some even installed doorbells to deal with inspections, creating a "gap" between the management layer and the managed layer. To manage the enterprise well, we must bridge this gap, enhance the management awareness of all employees, and shift from a passive to an active approach. Thus, I began to experiment with standardized group management.

Standardized group management requires that everyone, at all times, and in all matters, must act according to standards and regulations, reducing the subjectivity and arbitrariness in enterprise management. In recent years, we have promoted management standardization and standardization, making the various regulations of enterprise management more procedural, quantitative, and scientific, thereby enhancing their controllability, feasibility, and effectiveness.

Regulations are the highest authority. In their implementation, we adhere to the principle that those who manage others must first manage themselves; managers cannot be unconstrained while only constraining others; leaders must lead by example in adhering to regulations and laws, setting a model for others. The factory's entry and exit regulations stipulate that employees must wear the factory badge or show their employee ID when entering or leaving the factory. Everyone complies willingly and consistently, never omitting to show their ID just because the guard recognizes them. This year, due to product quality issues, I deducted 50% of the monthly bonuses of all factory-level administrative cadres, including myself, according to the economic responsibility system's reward and punishment conditions. Once, a deputy factory director accompanied a guest to the workshop but forgot to wear a mask. The workshop safety officer reported the incident to the safety department, and the deputy director's bonus was deducted according to the regulations.

Our factory has many processes and a long production cycle (generally, the production cycle for graphite products is about two months). The teams mainly work collectively on the processes. We leverage the democratic management role of the teams, focusing on what to do and how to manage, integrating production and management, so that frontline production workers combine production with management. Among the more than 600 teams in the factory, we select technically proficient and management-savvy individuals to serve as team leaders, democratically recommending quality inspectors, safety inspectors, economic accountants, attendance clerks, equipment managers, welfare officers, and political propaganda officers, and formulating work regulations for each group management officer. Business work is managed and guided by relevant functional departments and workshop functional personnel.

"The county magistrate is not as good as the local manager." No matter who enters their jurisdiction, they must follow the local rules, and violators will be punished. One day, the section head of the 304 workshop's high-alumina brick section, fearing production would be affected by the absence of the crane operator, operated the crane himself. He was discovered by a worker who also served as a safety inspector, ordered to stop immediately, and received safety education. The worker safety inspector made him give a self-criticism at the section's safety activity day and deducted his bonus according to the regulations. The section head not only accepted the criticism willingly but also praised the part-time safety inspector at the section meeting. "The county magistrate is not as good as the local manager" is also reflected in the fact that the local manager's role cannot be replaced by the county magistrate. For example, once a waste heat boiler in the 319 workshop, which used purified water, malfunctioned, causing a four-hour water stoppage. The water level in the boiler had already dropped below the allowable range, and if it continued to drop, an explosion would occur. In this critical moment, the operator, Zhou Zhi, in the absence of workshop leaders, decisively used circulating water to replace the purified water, preventing an accident.

Standardized group management has brought vitality and benefits to the enterprise. In 1987, our factory's total profit and tax revenue exceeded one billion yuan for the first time; in 1988, it reached 1.35 billion yuan, an increase of 19.6% over the previous year.

This year, the external environment of the enterprise is severe, with factors reducing profits by more than 26 million yuan. Employees are offering suggestions and implementing the dual-increase and dual-reduction targets, tapping into internal potential, and striving to increase the total profit and tax revenue compared to last year.

　　八千双手牵金马
    吉林炭素厂厂长  李圣华
    我厂荣获１９８８年度全国企业管理优秀奖之后，一些同行们问我：“老李，你是怎样把金马牵进厂的？”我回答说：“靠全厂八千多名职工开展规范化群体管理。”
    　　　　（一）
    以往，抓企业管理，紧一阵，严一阵；一放松，就回生。职工说，这叫“阵风式”。１９８６年，为了严格劳动纪律和工艺纪律，厂里制定了一套检查、考核和奖罚制度，开始确实有效。后来，在职工中产生了逆反心理，领导在上工序检查，下道工序迅速传来了“鸡毛信”，有的为对付查岗还安装了门铃，管理层与被管理层之间产生了“鸿沟”。要管理好企业，就必须跨越这个鸿沟，增强全体职工的管理意识，变被动式为主动式。于是，我开始尝试采用规范化群体管理。
    　　　　（二）
    规范化群体管理就是要求人人、时时、事事都必须按标准、法规去做，减少企业管理当中的主观随意性。近几年，我们通过推行管理规范化、标准化，使企业管理的各项法规更加程序化、定量化、科学化，进而提高其可控性、可行性和有效性。
    法规就是最高权威。在贯彻执行中，我们坚持做到：管人的人，首先要管好自己；管理者不能自己不受约束，专门去约束别人；领导干部要带头遵章守制，遵纪守法，发挥示范作用。工厂出入门制度规定：职工上下班进出厂必须佩戴厂徽或出示职工证。自觉遵守，坚持经常，从不因为门卫认识自己而不出示证件。今年１月，因产品质量问题，我按经济责任制规定的奖惩条件，扣发了包括我在内的所有厂级行政干部５０％的当月奖金。一次一名副厂长陪同客人下车间，由于忘记了戴口罩，车间安全员把情况反映给安全科，按规定扣了这位副厂长的奖金。
    　　　　（三）
    我厂工序多，生产周期长（一般石墨产品生产周期为两个月左右），班组在工序上主要是集体作业。我们发挥班组的民主管理作用，干什么，管什么，管干结合，使第一线生产工人集生产与管理于一身。全厂６００多个班组中，选聘出懂技术、会管理的人担任班组长，民主推荐质量员、安全员、经济核算员、考勤员、设备管理员、生活福利员、政治宣传员等，制定了各群体管理员的工作条例，业务工作由有关职能处室和车间职能人员进行对口管理指导。
    “县官”不如“现管”。不论是谁，只要进入他们的辖区，就要按那里的规矩办事，违犯了都要受罚。一天，３０４车间高炉块工段段长因天车工不在，怕影响生产自己上车作业，被工人兼职安全员发现，命令他立即停车，下来接受安全教育。工人安全员要他在工段安全活动日上做检查，并按规定扣奖金。段长不但心悦诚服地接受了批评，而且在工段大会上表扬了这位兼职安全员同志。“县官”不如“现管”还体现在“现管”的作用是“县官”代替不了的。如：一次，３１９车间的一台废热锅炉用的净化水发生了故障，停水四小时，锅炉里的水位已经下降到允许范围以下，再继续降下去就会发生爆炸事故。在紧急关头，操作工崔志，在找不到车间领导的情况下，当机立断，及时用循环水代替净化水，避免了事故的发生。
    规范化群体管理给企业带来了生机和效益。１９８７年，我厂实现利税总额第一次突破一亿元大关；１９８８年达到１．３５亿元，比上年增长１９．６％。
    今年，企业外部环境严峻，减利因素高达２６００多万元，职工们献计献策，落实双增双节目标，在企业内部挖掘潜力，力争利税总额比去年有所增长。
