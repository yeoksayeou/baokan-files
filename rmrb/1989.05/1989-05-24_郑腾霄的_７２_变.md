Zheng Tengxiao of the Urumqi National Garment Factory has brought new life to the stagnant garment industry in Xinjiang through his "72" transformation.

Zheng Tengxiao began using his transformation tactics in 1979 when he served as the deputy director of the Urumqi Jianxin Garment Factory. At that time, the factory produced six camel hair coats for the autumn trade fair. Hong Kong merchants praised the exquisite craftsmanship but sneered at the bulky and oversized design, ordering only 250 pieces. This incident stirred Zheng Tengxiao's thoughts, and he began to change his approach. He immediately sent six people to Guangzhou to observe the styles of women's coats worn by Hong Kong compatriots returning to the mainland for the Spring Festival. These individuals would follow and surveil at the train station during the day and sketch designs at the hotel at night. Sometimes, to capture the design of a woman's coat, they would follow her for several streets. After the Spring Festival, the six individuals returned to Zheng Tengxiao with several dozen coat designs. Zheng Tengxiao immediately revised the coat designs, and the order quantity from Hong Kong merchants increased significantly.

In May 1984, Zheng Tengxiao was transferred to the Urumqi National Garment Factory, which had been operating at a loss for years. People sighed, "Director Zheng has left, and the coat production technology has been taken away. Jianxin Factory is doomed!" However, Zheng Tengxiao changed his approach. He announced, "The coat technology will stay. Jianxin Factory will target Hong Kong, and I will target the Soviet Union!" Within a month of taking over, he day and night reviewed relevant materials and quickly designed several new products suitable for Soviet tastes, such as blouses, men's pajamas, and embroidered women's pajamas. That year, the factory exported 100,000 garments to the Soviet Union, becoming the first garment factory in Urumqi to open the export market. In that year, the factory not only cleared its 58,000 yuan deficit but also made a profit of 72,000 yuan.

Last year, the National Garment Factory introduced a suit production line. Zheng Tengxiao predicted that the suit market would cool down and immediately changed his mind: suits out, shirts in. In March, he sent workers to the Beijing Dahua Shirt Factory to learn, and by June, they began producing shirts, exporting 60,000 shirts that year.

At the height of shirt production success, Zheng Tengxiao was already considering returning to suits. He said, "Although suits are sluggish, high-quality, stylish suits will always be in demand." He plans to establish a high-end garment design room, build a high-end wool garment workshop, and improve the technical skills of workers and the factory's adaptability.

Zheng Tengxiao, through his transformation tactics, made the Urumqi National Garment Factory stand out in the gloomy national garment industry. The factory has the most export varieties and foreign exchange earnings, with export volume accounting for 1/4 of the entire Xinjiang region. There are processing points in four provinces and the northern and eastern regions of Xinjiang. The Kazakh Republic delegation from the Soviet Union has visited the factory three times, and merchants from Hong Kong, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey are eager to collaborate with him. Zheng Tengxiao told the reporter: Xinjiang is a colorful world, and Xinjiang garments will not fade in ten years. My principle is: if others have it, I will have it better; if others have it better, I will have it cheaper; if others have it cheaper, I will change. He will continue to change.

　　郑腾霄的“７２”变
    新华社记者  褚庆喜  申尊敬
    乌鲁木齐市民族服装厂厂长郑腾霄靠着“７２”变，给死气沉沉的新疆服装界带来生机。
    郑腾霄运用变术是从１９７９年在乌鲁木齐市建新服装厂当副厂长时开始的。那时，建新厂拿出６件驼绒女袄参加秋季广交会。港商们围着女袄，对精美绝伦的做工赞不绝口，但对肥厚长大的式样嗤之以鼻，仅订货２５０件。这事触动了郑腾霄的脑神经，思路开始了变化。他立刻派出６人前往广州，趁香港同胞回大陆过春节的机会，在火车站侦察港胞女袄的式样。这些人白天到火车站跟踪、盯梢，晚上回旅馆画图，有时为了记一位女士小袄的款式，竟尾随几条街。春节过后，６个人给郑腾霄带回了几十种女袄图样。郑腾霄立刻改变女袄设计，港商定货量大增。
    １９８４年５月，郑腾霄调任连年亏损的乌鲁木齐市民族服装厂厂长。人们叹道：郑厂长走了，女袄生产技术也带走了，建新厂这下完了！谁知郑腾霄变了，他宣布：女袄技术留下。建新厂往香港“打”，我往苏联“打”！他进厂一个月，白天黑夜地翻阅有关资料，很快设计出适合苏联人穿着习惯的布拉吉、男睡衣、女绣花睡袍等十几个新品种，当年向苏联出口服装１０万件，成为乌鲁木齐市第一家打开外销之路的服装厂。这一年除还清该厂５８０００元亏损，还盈利７２０００元。
    去年，民族服装厂引进的西装生产线到了。郑腾霄预测到西装市场开始退热，立即改变主意：西装退下上衬衣。他３月份派出工人到北京大华衬衣厂学习，６月份开始衬衣生产，当年就出口衬衣６万件。
    在衬衣生产大获成功的时候，郑腾霄却在考虑上西装了。他说：西装虽然滞销，但做工精良款式新颖的西装将会长期抢手。他计划成立高档服装设计室，增建高档呢绒服装车间，提高工人的技术素质和工厂的应变能力。
    郑腾霄靠着“变术”使乌鲁木齐市民族服装厂在全国服装行业不景气的情况下一枝独秀，服装出口品种和创汇数它最多，出口量占全疆的１／４。全国四个省和北疆东疆都有它的加工点，苏联哈萨克共和国代表团三次到厂参观，香港、日本、阿联酋、土耳其的商人追着要和他联营。郑腾霄告诉记者：新疆是个花花世界，新疆服装十年不衰。我的原则是：人无我有，人有我精，人精我廉，人廉我变。他还是要变。
