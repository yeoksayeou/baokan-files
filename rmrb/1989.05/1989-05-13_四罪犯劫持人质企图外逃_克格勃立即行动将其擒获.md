Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 12th.

Four criminals who hijacked hostages in an attempt to escape were captured on May 12th, and all hostages were rescued.

According to a report by Soviet Central Television this evening, four criminals detained in the isolation interrogation room of the Internal Affairs Bureau of Saratov Oblast threatened two female staff members and two young boys with homemade knives on May 10th during the day, taking them hostage. They demanded weapons and a large amount of money, and requested to be allowed to leave the province unobstructed. Along the way, the criminals took a couple with their two-year-old daughter and a female salesperson hostage, and made new demands: providing an airplane, vodka, etc. The criminals threatened to kill the hostages if their demands were not met.

Upon receiving the news, the Soviet State Security Committee immediately formed an action command headed by a general, and dispatched an action team to rush to Saratov. At 3 a.m. on the 12th, the action team members stormed into the room occupied by the criminals and arrested them.
