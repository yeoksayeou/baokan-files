“Suddenly, a spring breeze blows, and thousands of pear blossoms bloom overnight,” that is poetry; developing the economy is not so poetic, it requires step-by-step efforts, and rushing for quick results is not feasible. Dalian City has shown its unique characteristics in this regard—calm and steady progress.

If you study the list of outstanding entrepreneurs and excellent enterprise management award winners in the country over the past two years, you will find that five of them are from Dalian, accounting for 8.3% of the total;

If you study the situation of national product gold and silver awards over the past few years, you will find that the city with the highest number of awards for seven consecutive years is Dalian;

If you further study the industrial growth situation in Dalian over these years, you will find that it is relatively stable, with no significant fluctuations. Industrial total output value and tax revenue are growing in tandem. In the first quarter of this year, Dalian's industrial total output value increased by 8.7% compared to the same period last year, and the tax revenue of budgetary industrial enterprises increased by 8.5%.

What kind of soil is Dalian, which is conducive to the growth and development of enterprises and promotes the healthy development of the economy?

Learn the method of ducks laying eggs, quietly and patiently, focus on practical work, and lay a solid foundation.

In recent years, as an open city, Dalian seems to have few new experiences.

In fact, Dalian has not been idle. They have their own focus.

Opening up to the outside world has brought Dalian onto the international economic stage. However, can Dalian adapt? Not to mention other things, just consider the difficulty of making phone calls. Initially, it was extremely difficult for foreigners to make long-distance calls to their home countries, and they had to go to Beijing to do so. The municipal Party committee and government leaders were very clear: relying solely on the existing foundation, how can we attract foreigners and go global!

Therefore, they decided to do the foundational work and change the economic environment.

Dalian lacks fresh water and has insufficient electricity. Dalian planned the Biliu River Reservoir project with a capacity of 921 million cubic meters. The dam was successfully intercepted in September 1982, and the Biliu water supply project was put into operation in March 1984. After the completion of the second phase of the project this year, its scale is vast and can be compared with the Yunhe River diversion to Tianjin.

The new Huadian Dalian Power Plant, invested by Huadian and Dalian, was completed in just over two years. On July 31, 1988, the first unit was connected to the grid and started generating electricity, half a year ahead of schedule. As a result, Dalian's electricity supply increased by more than onefold.

To solve the problem of difficulty in making phone calls, Mayor Wei Fuhai made many trips, discussed projects, and introduced technologies. In August 1986, a program-controlled telephone exchange machine imported from Sweden was put into operation. Now, in Dalian, whether it is within the city or in the three northern counties (cities), there are direct-dial telephone services to major domestic cities and more than a dozen countries and regions. Three newly built flyovers have brought efficiency to Dalian's industrial areas and efficiency to Dalian people. As for the renovation of nearly a hundred old residential areas (blocks, points), the development of Xidaojie and Chunliu residential communities, which have enabled nearly 150,000 households and more than 600,000 residents to move into new homes, have been more talked about by Dalian people.

“Chickens lay eggs and cluck loudly, ducks lay eggs that are bigger than chickens but do not make a sound.” Dalian people say: “We should learn the spirit of ducks, do more practical work, and make less noise.” In Dalian, there are many such practical things, and people comment that the money spent by the municipal government is well spent. This year, during the rectification and adjustment, the first thing to be cut was the construction of buildings and halls. Surprisingly, Dalian does not have any. The result of the investigation is that there are none. In the past, some were built, but they were mainly invested by outsiders in Dalian. In recent years, Dalian has concentrated its financial, material, and human resources to focus on a number of infrastructure construction projects. In addition to the above projects, it has also expanded and reconstructed the airport and accelerated the construction of the port. In the Ande Island, three 10,000-ton berths have been newly built, and the Dawangwan New Port Area has been developed. The economic and technological development zone has formed the ability to use various supporting facilities. Now, when you stand on the "battery" built by Li Hongzhang by the sea and look south, north, and west: to the south, the new commercial and living area by the sea; to the north, the new industrial development zone; to the west, the vast Dalian Bay. You will be amazed: What a great Dalian, what a great development zone!

The new clothes have not been bought, but the old clothes have been taken off and thrown away, how can one go bareback? The municipal government pays great attention to playing a coordinating role in the market mechanism that is not yet fully developed.

Mayor Wei Fuhai said that the development of a commodity economy has a process, and in a situation where the market is not yet mature, the coordination of government departments is more important. He gave an example: if the new clothes have not been bought, but the old clothes have been taken off and thrown away, how can one go bareback?

When enterprises encounter difficulties, they should go to the market, but if the market is not developed, they still have to find the mayor. Entering 1988, there was a shortage of electricity and raw materials, and many enterprises in Dalian faced production difficulties. Dalian Steel Plant stopped 9 out of 10 furnaces; Dalian Chemical Industry Company's salt pile for producing soda ash was almost depleted... The municipal government leaders went to various bureaus and key enterprises to solve problems on the spot, solving problems of electricity, funds, and raw materials. Take Dalian Chemical for example, the production of soda ash requires 120,000 tons of salt per year, but the state only has an 87,000-ton plan that is not implemented. On-site meetings were held to research and decide that the Dalian Salt Bureau would increase 32,000 tons of salt outside the plan, and the Salt Bureau needed funds to increase production, which was solved by the salt-using units paying in advance.

In the transitional period of the old and new systems, the state can guarantee fewer things, and the market is not mature, and there are many enterprises that need to solve problems. However, Dalian's work is still very orderly and not chaotic. As soon as the city found out about the difficulties in organizing production this year, it immediately established four coordination groups to coordinate the development of raw materials and energy, coordinate funds, coordinate coal transportation, and coordinate industrial and commercial coordination. In this way, there are always people and organizations responsible for solving various problems at all times. On February 5, a fire accident occurred in the coal conveyor of Huadian Dalian Power Plant, which could not generate electricity normally, directly affecting the production of industrial enterprises in the whole city. Mayor Wei Fuhai and several deputy mayors immediately organized the establishment of a "repair" command department, urgently mobilized enterprises such as machinery, heavy industry, heavy lifting, shipbuilding, and 533, to repair day and night, and restored normal power generation in 15 days. At the same time, a large Japanese company also made preparations to participate in the repair, and their schedule was three months.

The coordination of government agencies is effective. Through the efforts of various parties, 120 million yuan of funds and 15 million US dollars of foreign exchange were coordinated and solved for enterprises in the first quarter, as well as non-plan coal, fuel oil, steel, soda ash, and sea salt. These were mainly used for the production of 93 products that are suitable for the market, which were identified anew in the whole city. The added value of these products in the first quarter accounted for 35% of the total added value; the output value of export products increased by 24.1% compared to the same period last year.

When doing something, first consider the pros and cons for economic development. Things with small benefits and large drawbacks are not done; things that are beneficial to the development of productive forces from the present to the long term are done with determination and great effort.

Last year, when some places were enthusiastically optimizing labor combinations, Dalian City was relatively quiet. Was it because they did not realize it? No! The municipal government and relevant departments of Dalian City analyzed and found that Dalian's current social security is lagging behind, and the economic environment faced by enterprises is very severe. The conditions for large-scale optimization of labor combinations are not yet mature, so only a few enterprises did it according to their own conditions.

However, Dalian's enterprise contracting is done very carefully. It was first piloted in 7 enterprises for a year, with good results, and then it was fully promoted in budgetary industrial enterprises, reaching 98%, including 102 large and medium-sized enterprises that fully implemented contracting. Each enterprise has its own innovations in contracting. Dalian Glass Factory and Jinzhou Asbestos Mine, among 72 enterprises, implemented open bidding for managers; Dalian Steel Plant, among 20 enterprises, implemented internal bidding for mid-level cadres; Dalian Refrigeration Machine Factory, among 16 enterprises, introduced a risk mechanism and implemented risk mortgage contracting...

This year, the municipal government once again determined that the policies related to contracting reform will not change, and clearly stated that in addition to fully implementing bidding competition for managers in new contracting and leasing enterprises, the focus will be on the bidding competition work of loss-making and unprofitable enterprises, preparing conditions for the establishment of a contracting and leasing market.

Dalian is one of the old industrial bases in China. Dalian Chemical, Dalian Heavy Industry, and Dalian Shipbuilding, among others, have existed since the Japanese occupation. The equipment is outdated, and technology is backward. Implementing technological transformation is a necessary condition for economic takeoff. The municipal Party committee and government leaders saw this clearly and, with the help of the reform and opening-up, pushed the technological transformation of enterprises forward by a big step. Look at the following figures: In the past five years, nearly 700 technical projects have been signed and completed, with nearly 500 million US dollars used, and more than 600 enterprises have been transformed. 80% of the introduced transformation projects have been completed and put into production. Moreover, through digestion and absorption, more than 3,000 new products have been developed, and more than 300 have reached or approached the advanced level of international similar products.

Dalian Steel Plant Director Zhao Mingren once told me about an incident. That was when he went to the United States to inspect, wanting to see the situation of Chinese steel exports. The American merchants led him to the sample room, where products from Japan, the Federal Republic of Germany, and China were all displayed. The steel bars of others were bright and shiny, and the material heads were at a 45-degree angle; the material of China was black with oxidized skin, some long and some short, and the material heads were rough and hanging. Old Zhao said, this is not an export, it is simply a waste of resources. After returning to the country, Old Zhao decided to build his own export base. Last year, he built a precision heat treatment workshop, and the processed steel products were not inferior to those of Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, becoming a sought-after product in the international market.

In Dalian, there are too many such things. Dalian Hydraulic Parts Factory introduced advanced technology from the American Wiggs Company, becoming the first large-scale hydraulic system production base in the country, and was recognized by the state as the only enterprise that can produce substitute imported products; Dalian High-Pressure Valve Factory introduced three multi-station precision machining machines from the Federal Republic of Germany, and the entire product series has been upgraded, and a large number of products are exported to the international market. The technological progress of enterprises has improved Dalian's product competitiveness in the international and domestic markets!

The severe economic environment has not favored Dalian. But, the more difficult it is, the more it shows the role of a solid foundation, and the more it shows the bearing capacity of Dalian's enterprises and managers. This is probably the place where Dalian seems ordinary but is actually profound!

　　“忽然一夜春风来，千树万树梨花开”，那是诗；发展经济可没有那么多诗  意，需要一点点去做，急于求成不得。大连市正是以此显露出自己的特色——
    不急不躁　稳步推进
    本报记者  江绍高
    如果你研究一下近两年全国优秀企业家、全国企业管理优秀奖获奖名单，你会发现，其中５个在大连，占总数的８．３％；
    如果你研究一下近几年来全国产品金、银奖评定情况，你会发现，获奖总数连续７年列省辖市第一名的，是大连；
    如果你再研究一下这些年大连市工业增长情况，你会发现，它比较平稳，没有大起大落。工业总产值、上交利税总是同步增长，今年一季度工业总产值比去年同期增长８．７％，预算内工业企业上交利税增长８．５％。
    大连是一块什么样的土壤，有利于企业的生长发育，促使经济健康地发展呢？
  学点鸭子生蛋的办法，静悄悄沉住气，抓实事，扎扎实实地打好基础
    这几年，作为开放城市，大连市拿出的新鲜经验似乎嫌少。
    其实，大连并没有闲着。他们有自己的着眼点。
    对外开放，把大连市推上国际经济舞台。可是大连适应得了吗？不说别的，就说外商来了，打电话，开初简直难极了，外商往本国挂长途，要跑到北京去挂。市委、市政府的领导很清楚：光靠原有的这个基础，怎么能吸引外商，走向世界！
    于是，他们下决心做打基础的工作，改变经济环境。
    大连市缺少淡水，电力不足。大连市规划了蓄水９．２１亿立方米的碧流河水库工程。１９８２年９月大坝截流成功，１９８４年３月引碧供水投入运行，今年二期工程完成后，其规模浩大，可与引滦入津相媲美。
    新建华能大连电厂，华能投资，大连聚资，两年多就建成了。１９８８年７月３１日一号机组并网发电，比国家计划提前半年，大连市电力因此而提高一倍以上。
    解决打电话难，市长魏富海没少跑动，谈项目，搞引进，１９８６年８月从瑞典引进的程控电话交换机投入运行。现在的大连，无论市内还是北部三个县（市），同国内主要城市和十几个国家、地区都有直拨电话。三座新建的立交桥，给大连工业区带来了效率，给大连人带来了效率。至于上百个居民旧区（片、点）的改造，石道街、春柳等住宅小区的开发，使得近１５万户、６０多万居民喜迁新居，更为大连人津津乐道了。
    “鸡下个蛋咯咯嗒嗒叫个不停，鸭子下蛋比鸡的大，却不吭声。”大连人说：“要学点鸭子精神，多干实事，少嚷嚷。”在大连，这类实实在在的事很多，人们评论，市政府的钱花得是地方。今年治理整顿，首先压缩的就是楼堂馆所。奇怪，大连没有。查的结果就是没有。过去建过一些，也主要是外地在大连投资建的。这些年，大连集中财力、物力、人力，抓了一批基础设施的建设，除了上述项目外，还扩建、改建机场，加快港口建设，在和尚岛新建了３个万吨级泊位，开发大窑湾新港区。经济技术开发区各项基础设施已形成配套使用能力。如今，当你站在当年李鸿章依海而建的“炮台”，往南、往北、往西瞭望：南边海湾，新的商业生活区；北边，新兴的工业开发区；往西，茫茫大连湾。你会惊叹：好一个大连，好一个开发区！
  新衣服没买来，就把旧衣服脱掉了扔了，光着脊梁那怎么行？市政
    　　府很注意在市场机制尚未发育健全情况下，发挥协调作用
    市长魏富海说，商品经济发展有个过程，在市场尚未健全的情况下，政府部门的协调更显得重要。他打了个比方，新衣服没买来，就把旧衣服全部脱了扔了，光着脊梁那怎么行？
    企业遇到困难，应该去找市场，但市场不发育，他们还要找市长。进入１９８８年，电力短缺，原材料短缺，大连不少企业生产遇到了困难。大连钢厂，１０个炉子停了９个；大连化学工业公司，生产烧碱的盐垛见底了……市政府领导到各局、到各重点企业现场办公，解决电的问题、资金问题、原材料问题。就说大化吧，生产碱一年需１２０万吨盐，国家只有８７万吨的计划还不落实，现场办公研究，由大连盐务局计划外增加３２万吨盐，盐务局增产需要资金，采取用盐单位先付款的办法解决。
    处于新旧体制转换时期，国家能保证的东西少了，市场又不健全，要解决问题的企业太多了。然而，大连的工作还是很有条理，不慌乱。市里一发现今年组织生产的困难，马上成立了４个协调小组，协调原料能源开发，协调资金，协调煤炭运输，协调工商衔接。这样，时刻都有人有机构负责解决各种问题。２月５日，华能大连电厂输煤栈道发生火灾事故，不能正常发电，直接影响全市工业企业生产。市长魏富海和几个副市长，马上组织成立“抢修”指挥部，紧急调动机车、大重、大起、造船、五三三等企业，昼夜抢修，１５天恢复正常发电。而同时，日本一家大公司也作了参加抢修的准备，他们的时间表是三个月。
    政府机关的协调是富有成效的，经过多方面的努力，一季度为企业协调解决资金１．２亿元，外汇１５００万元，还有计划外煤炭、燃料油、钢材、纯碱、海盐等。这些，主要用于全市重新确定的９３个适销对路产品的生产上，这些产品一季度增加的产值占增产总值的３５％；出口产品产值比去年同期增长２４．１％。
  办一件事情，先看对经济发展的利和弊。弊大利小的事不干；从眼
    　　前到长远都有利于生产力发展的，下狠心，大力干
    去年，当一些地方企业优化劳动组合搞得很火热时，大连市动静不大。是没有认识到吗？不！大连市政府和有关部门通过分析，觉得大连目前社会保障滞后，企业面临的经济环境很严峻，大面积搞优化劳动组合的条件还不成熟，所以只有少数企业根据自己的条件去做。
    但是，大连市的企业承包却搞得很细致。先是在７个企业试点一年，效果很好，接着预算内工业企业全面推开，达９８％，其中１０２户大中型企业全部实行了承包。各企业在承包中各有创造，大连玻璃厂和金州石棉矿等７２户企业实行经营者公开招标；大连钢厂等２０户企业对中层干部实行内部招标定聘；大连冷冻机厂等１６户企业引入风险机制，实行风险抵押承包……
    今年，市政府再次确定，有关承包改革的政策不变，并且明确，除在新承包、租赁的企业中全面推行招标竞争经营者外，重点抓亏损和经营不景气企业的招标竞争工作，为建立承包、租赁市场准备条件。
    大连是我国老工业基地之一，大化、大重、大起等企业在日本人占领时就有了。设备陈旧，技术落后，实行技术改造是经济起飞的必要条件。市委、市政府领导看准了这一点，借改革、开放的东风，把企业技术改造大大向前推进了一步。请看下面几个数字：五年来共签约成交引进技术项目近７００项，用汇近５亿美元，６００多个企业得到改造，8０％的引进改造项目竣工投产。而且，通过消化吸收，开发了３０００多种新产品，３００多种达到或接近国际同类产品先进水平。
    大连钢厂厂长赵明仁对我讲过一件事，那是他到美国考察，想看一看中国钢材出口情况，美商把他引到样品室，日本、联邦德国、中国的产品都摆在那里。人家的钢棒明光发亮，一展齐，材料头呈４５度角；中国的材料带着黑色的氧化皮，长一根短一根的，材料头粗糙挂手。老赵说，这哪里是出口，简直是白扔资源。回国后，老赵决心建自己的出口基地，去年建成精整热处理车间，加工后的钢材与日本、联邦德国的产品毫不逊色，成了国际市场抢手货。
    在大连，像这样的事情太多了，大连液压件厂引进美国威格士公司的先进技术，成为全国第一个大型成套液压系统生产基地，被国家认定为唯一能生产替代进口产品的企业；大连高压阀门厂从联邦德国引进３台多工位精密加工机后，整个产品系列上了一个等级，大量出口到国际市场。企业的技术进步，提高了大连市产品在国际国内市场的竞争力！
    经济环境的严峻，丝毫没有偏爱大连。但，愈是艰难，愈显出扎实基础的作用，愈显出大连的企业和经营者们的承受能力。这大概正是大连看似平淡实则深刻的地方！
