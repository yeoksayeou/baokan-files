After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Gu Jiegang returned from Chongqing to his hometown—Su Zhou, where he temporarily resided in Gu Jia Yuan in Xuanqiao Lane. At that time, he served as the director of the editorial department of Wen Tong Bookstore, which was located in his home. Therefore, he often visited the old bookstore where I worked to seek books, and we became acquainted. He was in need of ancient history and folk customs-related line-bound ancient books, and he also paid attention to collecting local documents of Su Zhou, such as "Tongqiao Yi Zhao Lu."

In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, the collection of books from Ding Zuyin's "Shu Zhaotang" in Changshu was dispersed, and I had acquired several dozen good books, including a copy of "Shui Jing Zhu," which was a copy printed by Huang Sheng of Tian Du during the Qianlong era. The original book was bound in twenty volumes, annotated and corrected in red ink by Yao Yuan of Tongcheng, and had seals. Mr. Gu was delighted upon seeing it and requested to buy it. However, he proposed paying in two installments. We agreed, and he was very pleased.

Mr. Gu not only loved books dearly but also cared deeply about scientific research work. Once, I received a manuscript titled "Geng Gui Ji Lue," authored by "Jian Pu Ye Lao," which recorded the activities of the Taiping Army in Wujiang from the tenth year of Xianfeng to the second year of Tongzhi. It had never been printed. After reading it, he took out his name card, wrote a few words, and asked me to contact Mr. Luo Ergang directly. Soon after the letter was sent, a reply agreeing to purchase the book was received. Due to the high historical value of the book, it was later printed by the Institute of Modern History as part of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Materials." Regarding the true name of Jian Pu Ye Lao, it was not known at that time. Recently, in the bookstore of an antique bookstore in Su Zhou, I discovered a handwritten copy of "Shi Wen Tong Zai" in two volumes from "Wei Wei Zhai," with a preface stating: "This compilation was hand-copied by my nephew, Mr. Dong Menglan, ... on the day before the ninth day of the ninth month of the Dingmao year of Tongzhi, Jian Pu Ye Lao, Wang Yuanbang." According to the county annals, Dong Zouxiong, whose courtesy name is Menglan, was originally surnamed Wang. His father died early, and he followed his mother's surname, Dong. ... Wang Yuanbang was his uncle, which matches the preface. I mention this for reference in research.

Later, Mr. Gu went to Shanghai to serve as the general manager of Da Zhongguo Bookstore and also as a professor at Fudan University. He still often came to Su Zhou with Mr. Hu Houxuan and five or six other professors on Sundays to seek books. At that time, the sources of ancient books were abundant, and each visit resulted in a full load of books. Once, I showed him some newly acquired rare ancient books, including the Ming Dynasty's initial edition of "Nanji Dili" with black mouth, the edition of "Tanzi Huashu" printed by the Prince of Dai's mansion with black mouth, the edition of "Baihu Tong De Lun" printed during the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty (annotated by Sun Xingyan), the exquisite edition of "Jingming Zongjiao" with illustrations printed during the Wanli era (nine volumes remaining), the edition of "Beixiang Ji" printed during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty (illustrated by Wu Men Shu Junsu), the exquisite edition of "Guben Jingzhaiji" with illustrations printed during the Wanli era, the old handwritten copy of "Youxue Ji Pingzhu" from the early Qing Dynasty (annotated by Huang Pile, signed as "Shu Mo"), the manuscript of "Jin Weijun's Poetry Collection in Three Volumes" from the Qianlong era ("Paimen Ji," "Yewan Shichao," and "Feicui Lanpu Ji," with handwritten prefaces by Shen Deping and Zhang Pengxu), and the manuscript of "Chuoxian Shanfang Shichao" by Shen Bingyuan. He enthusiastically read through the books and suggested that the Shanghai Library purchase them, asking me to contact the director, Li Fangfu, with his letter of introduction. As a result, all the books were kept. This is another example of Mr. Gu's concern for social and cultural affairs and his efforts to preserve the cultural heritage of the motherland.

Another time, while reading the "Ming Dynasty Woodblock Print Catalog Preliminary Edition" compiled by Mr. Gu Qizhong (Tinglong) and Mr. Pan Jingzheng, I was inspired. I thought that if the remaining pages of Ming Dynasty woodblock prints could be bound together and explained, it would be even better. I went to Shanghai to visit Mr. Gu at the Da Zhongguo Bookstore on Sichuan North Road and shared my idea with him. He highly praised it and expressed his willingness to write a preface for the book. Therefore, I accelerated the process of identifying the editions of each book and wrote explanatory notes, which I first sent to Mr. Pan Jingzheng for review before forwarding them to him. Not long after, Mr. Gu sent the preface, which was written in classical Chinese and highly praised Ming Dynasty woodblock prints.

In 1954, Mr. Gu was transferred to the Institute of History at the Chinese Academy of Sciences as a researcher, and his entire family moved to Beijing. The books he left in Su Zhou were decided to be taken away, and a train car was packed, requiring our assistance with the packaging. After the work was completed, before his departure, he held a banquet at the Six-Righteousness Tower Restaurant in Xizhong Market to express his gratitude. During the banquet, he shared his experiences from his fieldwork in the northwestern region.

Although Mr. Gu rarely returned to Su Zhou afterward, he maintained some contact and often wrote letters requesting books that were difficult to obtain in Beijing. During the three years of natural disasters, he once came to Su Zhou and visited the bookstore, but unfortunately, I was out on a business trip and did not get to see him. However, we continued to exchange letters until the correspondence stopped just before the Cultural Revolution.

　　顾颉刚先生访书
    江澄波
    抗日战争胜利以后，顾颉刚先生从重庆回到故乡——苏州悬桥巷顾家花园借居。他当时担任文通书局编辑所所长，办公地方就在他家里，因而经常来我工作的那家旧书店访书，得以相识。他需要的是古史和民俗方面的线装古籍，同时也注意收集像《桐桥倚棹录》那样的苏州地方文献。
    建国初期，常熟丁祖荫“淑照堂”藏书散出，我曾收得善本书数十种，其中有一部《水经注》，是乾隆时天都黄晟刻本，原衬订二十册，曾经桐城姚元之用朱笔校注，并有印记。顾老看到以后，爱不释手地要求买回去。但又提出能否分两次付款。我们同意了，他感到很高兴。
    顾老不但自己爱书如命，同时也很关心科学研究工作。有一次我收到了一本书名叫《庚癸记略》的手稿本，著者署名为“倦圃野老”，全书记载咸丰十年至同治二年间太平军在吴江活动情况，从来没有刻印过。他看过以后就取出自己名片，写上几句话，要我直接和罗尔纲先生联系。信发出不久，很快接到决定购藏的回信。由于该书史料价值较高，后来被近代史研究所印入《太平天国资料》。关于倦圃野老的真实姓名，那时未能查到。最近我在苏州古旧书店书库里，发现了“味无味斋”钞本的《事文统载》二册，首有题跋称：“是编为余侄董生梦兰所手钞，……同治丁卯重九前一日倦圃野老王元榜识。”查《县志》，董兆熊字梦兰，本姓王，父早世，随母姓董。……”王元榜为其叔伯行，与跋中称余侄相符。顺此提及，以供研究参考。
    后来，顾老去上海大中国图书局任总经理，兼复旦大学教授。仍常在星期天与胡厚宣先生等五六位教授，结伴同来苏州访书。其时古籍书源充沛，每次都能满载而归。有一次我给他看了部分新收到的珍本古书，有明初刊黑口本《南极地理》和代王府刊黑口本《谭子化书》，明嘉靖刊本《白虎通德论》（孙星衍校跋），万历精刻插图本《净明宗教》（残存九卷），明万历刻本《北西厢记》（吴门殳君素绘图版画），万历精刻插图本《古本荆钗记》，清初旧钞本《有学集笺注》（有黄丕烈校跋，署名“书魔”），乾隆时人稿本《金惟骏诗集三种》（《排闷集》、《野庵诗钞》、《翡翠兰苕集》，有沈德潜、张鹏翀亲笔书序），沈炳垣手稿《斲研山房诗钞》等。他兴致勃勃地看完了书，表示将建议上海图书馆购藏，要我凭他的介绍信去上海找李芳馥馆长联系。结果全部留下。这是顾老关心社会文化事业，为保存祖国文化遗产出力的又一例证。
    另一次我在拜读顾起潜（廷龙）、潘景郑两先生合编的《明代版刻图录初编》时，得到启发。我想如果能把明刻残页装订起来，加以说明，不是更好吗？我就到上海四川北路大中国图书局拜访了顾老，把我的想法告诉他。他大加赞赏，表示愿为此书作序。因而我加快步伐做好了每种书的版本鉴定工作，并写了文字说明，先送请潘景郑先生审定后再转给他。时隔不久，顾老就把序文寄来了，是用文言文写的，对明版书作了很高的评价。
    １９５４年顾老调任中国科学院历史研究所任研究员，全家迁往北京，留在苏州的藏书，决定全部带去，包了一节火车，要求我们帮助解决包装问题。工作结束后，临行之前，他还在西中市六宜楼菜馆设宴表示谢意。席间他介绍了去西北地区考察时的见闻。
    此后顾老虽然很少回苏，但仍保持着一定的联系，他经常来信索购北京不易买到的书。三年自然灾害期间，曾经来苏一次，并到书店来看过我，惜因出差在外未能见面。但信函往来则至“文革”前夕才中断。
