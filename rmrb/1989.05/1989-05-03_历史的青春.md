Title: The Youth of History

	I have traversed countless centuries,
	Yet I remain as young as the blue sky.
	I have watched the river flow for a moment,
	But I have already become an old man with faltering steps.
	I wear clothes that never fade,
	Yet every part of me has torn hems.
	Some say I am the morning sun,
	Because I have the red fuel to illuminate the dawn.
	Some say I am hope,
	Because I have endless paths.
	But I have not rested on my laurels,
	With my youthful resilience,
	I have dyed red one historical morning after another.

	I am not a skylark soaring through the air,
	Enjoying the clouds as companions,
	Looking down on the land's honesty and steadfastness.
	Nor am I an earthworm burrowing underground,
	Gorging on the soil's fragrance,
	Ignoring the sky's vastness and depth.
	I am just a blade of grass, a green mountain,
	And a small boat riding the waves.
	In the vibrant background of music,
	I entrust my fate to storms, ravines, and reefs.
	History has inscribed on my back and soul
	The motto of youth.

　　历史的青春
    社科院新闻系  李瑞农
    我走过了多少世纪
    却永远似蓝天那样年轻
    我注视着长河的一瞬
    却已变成步履蹒跚的老人
    我身着穿不败的新衣
    但哪一处没有我破碎的衣襟
    有人说我是朝阳
    因为我有鲜红的燃料去照亮黎明
    有人说我是希望
    因为我有无穷的路程
    而我并没有坐享其成
    以自己带着嫩气的坚韧
    染红了一个又一个历史的早晨。
    我不是穿行空中的云雀
    乐以浮云为伴
    看不起土地的憨厚和沉稳
    也不是钻行地下的蚯蚓
    贪得泥土的芳馨
    无视蓝天的辽阔和幽深
    我只是一棵小草、一架青山
    和飞遏浪尖的扁舟一轮
    在音乐的鲜艳背景中
    将命运交给风暴、沟壑和险滩
    历史就在我的脊臂和心灵上
    写上青春的座右铭
