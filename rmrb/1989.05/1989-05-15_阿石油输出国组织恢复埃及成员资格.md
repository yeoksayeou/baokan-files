The Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries Organization (APECO) today decided to restore Egypt's membership in the organization and its companies.

This decision was made at the 42nd meeting of the member countries' oil ministers held in Kuwait. The meeting was chaired by the United Arab Emirates' Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, Mani al-Sayyid Utayba. Utayba welcomed Egypt as the "mother, brother, or sister of the Arabs" back to the Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries Organization during the opening ceremony.

Egypt had its membership suspended by the Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries Organization in 1979 after signing the Camp David Peace Accords with Israel.
