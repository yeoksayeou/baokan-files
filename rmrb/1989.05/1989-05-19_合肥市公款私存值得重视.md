Recently, relevant departments investigated several savings institutions in Hefei City and discovered that almost every investigated savings institution had the issue of public funds being privately stored. In December 1988, the amount of public funds privately stored accounted for approximately 25% of the net increase in savings for that month. The privately stored public funds included construction funds, special funds, working capital, business funds, and insurance premiums from insurance institutions. The main reasons for public funds being privately stored are as follows: First, savings institutions aim to complete or exceed their savings targets. One savings institution, at the end of the year, counted a sum of 400,000 yuan in public funds as personal savings, and after the New Year, transferred it back to the original unit; second, enterprises and institutions evade the management of cash and consumption funds. A certain company and a design institute respectively transferred 400,000 yuan in construction funds and 500,000 yuan in operational income into personal savings.

Public funds being privately stored are not conducive to the control of consumption funds and the management of cash and credit funds, and they also affect the authenticity of savings and related data, making it difficult to analyze, plan, and make decisions. This issue warrants high attention.

　　合肥市公款私存值得重视
    最近，有关部门调查了合肥市一些储蓄所，发现几乎每个被调查的储蓄所都有公款私存问题。１９８８年１２月，公款私存额约占当月储蓄净增额的２５％。私存的公款有工程款、专用基金、流动资金、营业款、保险机构的保险费等。公款私存的主要原因是：一是储蓄所为了完成和超额完成储蓄任务。有个储蓄所年底将一笔４０万元公款算作私人储蓄款，一过年又转回原单位；二是企事业单位逃避现金和消费基金管理。有一家公司和某设计院分别将４０万元工程款和５万元事业收入转为私人储蓄。
    公款私存，不利于对消费基金的控制和现金、信贷资金的管理，并且影响储蓄及有关数据的真实性，给分析、计划和决策带来困难。值得引起高度重视。
