	Zhao Ziyang, Li Peng, Hu Qili, Wang Zhen, Wu Xueqian, Ding Guan'gen, Ye Fei, and Fang Yi, among other leaders, met with all the representatives attending the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference this morning in Zhongnanhai and took a group photo with them.

	The conference, which concluded today, began on May 5. Before the conference, Premier Li Peng chaired a meeting of the Premier's Office to hear a report on the work of the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and spoke on overseas Chinese affairs.

	The conference pointed out that the basic tasks of the overseas Chinese affairs departments in the future are to protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, to unite overseas Chinese and returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, to foster friendly relations with overseas Chinese of foreign nationality, and to strive for the revitalization of China, the unification of the motherland, and the development of friendly cooperation with the people of all countries.

	The conference believed that in recent years, the overseas Chinese affairs departments have also done a lot of work and achieved considerable results in developing contacts and cooperation with overseas Chinese, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and their organizations, and in serving economic construction. The State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and local overseas Chinese affairs offices have received over 4.1 million visits from overseas Chinese, foreign nationals of Chinese descent, and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan in the past five years. According to statistics, enterprises established in China by compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese and foreign nationals of Chinese descent, account for more than 80% of the total number of "three types of enterprises" currently in the country.

	It is reported: Vice Premier Wu Xueqian said at the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Conference that there is a very bad practice now of extorting from overseas Chinese. It is not allowed to extort from overseas Chinese, and this should be an important measure for overseas Chinese affairs departments and relevant departments to rectify improper practices and eliminate corruption. He said that the central government and the State Council have repeatedly emphasized that it is not allowed to solicit donations from overseas Chinese, but in some places, the practice of soliciting donations is still prevalent, and even some county magistrates and deputy magistrates personally solicit donations from overseas Chinese, causing a very bad impression among overseas Chinese.

	Wu Xueqian pointed out that in some places, the cost of projects donated by overseas Chinese is increased, and they are extorted in a disguised manner. In some places, too many delegations are sent abroad, and the expenses for these visits are also borne by overseas Chinese. In business dealings with overseas Chinese, some cadres use their power for personal gain. These behaviors seriously damage the reputation of the Party and the state and harm the interests of overseas Chinese.

	Wu Xueqian demanded that the overseas Chinese affairs departments take the lead in rectification and work with relevant departments to thoroughly investigate these issues and resolutely stop this bad practice.

　　吴学谦在国务院侨务工作会议上说    
    决不允许敲华侨竹杠 
    赵紫阳李鹏胡启立等会见全体与会代表
    新华社北京５月９日电  （记者胡清海）赵紫阳、李鹏、胡启立、王震、吴学谦、丁关根、叶飞、方毅等领导同志今天上午在中南海会见了出席国务院侨务工作会议的全体代表，并和他们合影留念。
    今天结束的这次会议是５月５日开始召开的。会前，李鹏总理主持总理办公会议，听取了国务院侨务办公室的工作汇报，并就侨务工作讲了话。
    会议指出，侨务部门今后的基本任务是，保护华侨和归侨、侨眷的正当合法权益，广泛团结海外华侨和归侨、侨眷，增进同外籍华人的友好情谊，为振兴中华、统一祖国、发展同各国人民的友好合作而努力。
    会议认为，近年来侨务部门在发展同海外华侨、外籍华人及其社团的联系及合作交流，为经济建设服务等方面也做了许多工作，取得了较大成绩。国务院侨办和各地侨办５年来共接待华侨、外籍华人、港澳台同胞４１０多万人次。据统计，港、澳、台、侨胞和外籍华人以法人名义来华投资兴办的企业，占全国现有“三资企业”总数的８０％以上。
    又讯：吴学谦副总理在国务院侨务工作会议上说，现在有一种很不好的风气，就是向华侨敲竹杠。不准向华侨敲竹杠，应作为侨务工作和有关部门纠正不正之风，消除腐败现象的一项重要措施。他说，中央和国务院三令五申，不准向华侨伸手劝募，但有些地方劝募之风仍然盛行，甚至有的县长、副县长亲自出面向华侨募捐，在华侨中造成很坏影响。
    吴学谦指出，有的地方，对华侨捐赠兴建的工程加码加价，变相勒索。有的地方组团出访过多过滥，出访费用也要华侨负担。在同华侨的业务交往中，还有些干部以权谋私。这些行为严重败坏了党和国家的声誉，损害了华侨的利益。
    吴学谦要求侨务部门在治理整顿中起表率带头作用，会同有关部门认真清理这类问题，坚决刹住这股歪风。
