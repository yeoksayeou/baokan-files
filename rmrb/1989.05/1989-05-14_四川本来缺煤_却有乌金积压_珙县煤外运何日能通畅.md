Sichuan is severely short of coal, requiring large quantities to be imported from other provinces each year. Some power plants are in dire straits, scrambling to find coal to keep their furnaces running. Even household coal is in short supply, and some people are making fortunes by reselling it at high prices. Meanwhile, in the impoverished mountainous region of Liquan County in southwestern Sichuan, there are massive stockpiles of coal that cannot be transported out, leading to coal blocks weathering and spontaneous combustion, wasting precious resources.

Liquan County is one of the few coal bases in Sichuan. In recent years, due to transportation bottlenecks, the county now has over 30 million tons of coal stockpiled, forcing more than 20 production enterprises to halt operations.

It is understood that Sichuan has recently expanded the capacity of the Chongqing Power Plant and Baima Power Plant by 400,000 kilowatts each, requiring an additional 300 million tons of coal annually. Because Liquan County's coal cannot be transported out, to ensure coal supply for power plants and industrial use, Sichuan has to transport coal from distant provinces. A responsible official from the Chongqing Railway Bureau said that although they have been transporting coal from Liquan County every year, the railway from Yibin to Liquan County is built along steep terrain, making it difficult for a single locomotive to pull more than 6 or 7 cars, significantly limiting the transportation capacity.

The reporter also learned that in the past, the production, sales, and transportation of coal in Liquan County were relatively balanced. However, since the implementation of unified management of coal transportation and sales, the fulfillment rate of allocated rail cars has been poor, and the number of approval links for transportation plans has increased, adding to the economic burden of operating units. In the first quarter of this year, the county actually dispatched 1,400 rail cars, with a fulfillment rate of only 50%, a decrease of over 3,600 cars compared to the same period last year.

The Liquan County Party Committee and government appeal to relevant departments to take immediate measures to tap into transportation potential and rush the stockpiled coal out of the county. Otherwise, by June and July during the high-temperature season, large-scale fires may occur, with even more dire consequences.

### 四川本来缺煤　却有乌金积压  珙县煤外运何日能通畅

　　四川本来缺煤　却有乌金积压    
    珙县煤外运何日能通畅
    四川全省煤炭异常紧缺，每年需大量从外省调进，有的电厂燃煤朝不保夕，四处找米下锅；民用燃煤也很紧张，不少人乘机高价倒卖发了财。而地处川南贫困山区的珙县却有大量煤炭积压运不出去，造成块煤风化、自燃，宝贵的资源白白浪费。
    珙县是四川为数不多的煤炭基地。近年来由于煤炭运输不畅，目前这个县煤炭已积压３０多万吨，县２０多家生产企业被迫先后停产。
    据了解，四川近两年在重庆电厂和白马电厂各扩建了４０万千瓦的机组，每年需增加３００多万吨煤。由于珙县的煤运不出来，为保证各电厂发电和工业用煤，四川不得不千里迢迢从外省拉煤。负责拉运珙县煤炭的重庆铁路分局的同志说，尽管他们每年都没少拉，但由于从宜宾到珙县这段铁路，依山势修建，火车爬坡上坎，一个车头仅能拉６、７个车皮，大大限制了运量。
    记者还了解到，过去珙县煤炭的产、销、运一直比较平衡，但自从实行煤炭运销归口管理以后，车皮发运兑现率较差，报批运输计划环节增多，增大了经营单位的经济负担。今年一季度全县车皮实际发运１４００个，兑现率只占５０％，比去年同期减少３６００多个。
    珙县县委、县政府呼吁，希望有关部门尽快采取措施，挖掘运输潜力，把积压的煤炭抢运出县。否则到６、７月份高温季节，将会大面积燃烧，后果更不堪设想。
