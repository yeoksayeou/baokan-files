Macroeconomic control needs to coordinate reform and development

The economic models discussed here primarily refer to the economic system model, economic growth model, and industrial structure model. Although ownership models, enterprise models, market models, etc., also belong to economic models, due to space limitations, they will not be extensively examined. The transition of these economic models is closely related to macroeconomic control. If the macroeconomic control during the transition period of the economic system model is studied in isolation, it is often difficult to properly coordinate with the transition of the economic growth model and the evolution of the industrial structure, making it difficult to organically combine reform with development. Based on this consideration, we will examine macroeconomic control within the broad scope of the economic model transition period.

The transition of China's economic system model will take a relatively long time. The contradictions and frictions brought by the coexistence of dual economic systems are becoming increasingly sharp. Meanwhile, the economic development model is also beginning to change. In terms of the relationship between speed and efficiency, the economic growth model is shifting from a speed-oriented approach to an efficiency-oriented approach; in terms of the socialist expanded reproduction method, it is shifting from an extensive approach to an intensive approach; in terms of economic management methods, it is shifting from an extensive approach to an intensive approach. The difficulty of transitioning the economic growth model is considerable. The transition of the industrial structure in economic development is even more complex. China's socialist construction has covered nearly forty years, forming a considerable scale of material and technological foundations, and possessing a relatively complete industrial system. Due to the heavy pressure of population growth and labor employment, especially the transfer of surplus rural labor, as well as the relatively slow development of light industry, it is imperative to develop labor-intensive industries; while China is in the stage of strengthening energy and basic raw material construction, it is also necessary to focus on developing high-tech industries, which makes the process of industrial structure transition in China face tasks and requirements different from other developing countries, revealing new contradictions and conflicts.

The transitions of the economic system model, economic growth model, and industrial structure model have their own contradictions and interact with and constrain each other, collectively manifesting as the contradiction between reform and development. Therefore, macroeconomic control during the transition period of economic models must not only correctly handle the contradictions within the three models but also coordinate the transitions of the three models, making them mutually reinforcing rather than constraining each other. To this end, it is necessary to grasp the focal points or convergence points of the contradictions in the transition process of the three models and coordinate the relationship between reform and development. This involves many issues, but the most important ones are correctly choosing macroeconomic control targets and strengthening and improving the comprehensive balance of the national economy, which are the fundamental aspects of strengthening and improving macroeconomic control in the current and future periods.

Correctly Choosing Macroeconomic Control Targets

Correctly choosing macroeconomic control targets is crucial for the stability and long-term healthy development of the national economy. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp the basic factors influencing macroeconomic conditions. These factors are reflected in the following macroeconomic control targets.

Inflation Rate: Based on China's relevant statistical data and reference to the experience of developing countries, it can be said that China is currently in a stage of moderate inflation. Addressing such severe inflation requires both austerity measures to maintain overall balance and significant structural improvements to provide a solid foundation for overall balance. This task cannot be fully accomplished by austerity policies alone. Adjusting the structure and eliminating bottlenecks requires a relatively long time, and until this problem is fundamentally resolved, the risk of inflation will persist. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have proposed that the price increase rate this year should be significantly lower than last year, which is a serious economic task and a serious political task. However, gradually reducing the price increase rate and basically eliminating inflation, such as controlling the price increase rate within 3-5%, to achieve an economic growth with basically no inflation, is a goal that can only be achieved through long-term efforts. Setting unrealistic goals is impractical and harmful.

Economic Growth Rate: China's economic overheating is mainly reflected in the rapid growth of industry, especially general processing industry. The basic constraints on China's industrial growth are primarily agriculture. Some research institutions have provided data showing that in the industrialization process of some countries, the growth rate ratio of agriculture to industry is approximately 1:3 in the initial stage, 1:2-2.5 in the middle stage, and approximately 1:1.5-2 in the later stage. China is in the late stage of the initial period or the early stage of the middle period of industrialization, and the growth rate ratio of agriculture to industry should be maintained at approximately 1:2-2.5. In the future, China's normal agricultural growth rate should be around 4%, and the actual industrial growth rate should be maintained between 8-10%. Exceeding this range, agriculture will struggle to bear the burden and pressure of industrial growth. Another factor constraining China's industrial growth is the import capacity of raw materials. Rapid industrial growth will inevitably increase import pressure, and if export capacity cannot adapt, it will often exacerbate the imbalance of foreign exchange receipts and payments. The third factor constraining China's industrial growth is the development of the energy and basic raw material industries. In recent years, although China's energy and raw material industries have grown rapidly, they are still far from meeting the needs of the rapidly growing processing industry, leading to imbalances within the industry. Based on the above judgments, it is necessary to gradually reduce the growth rate of the processing industry to a reasonable level.

Total Demand: Especially to curb the rapid growth of investment and consumption demand. Investment comes from accumulation, and compressing investment inevitably requires reducing the accumulation rate. In recent years, China's accumulation rate has risen sharply from 31.5% in 1984 to 35.2% in 1985, and although it has slightly decreased in 1986-1987, it has remained at a high level of 34.8% and 34.7%. Considering the impact of price factors, the accumulation rate should not be too low and should be maintained at around 30% of national income. While reducing the accumulation rate and compressing investment demand, it is particularly important to reasonably adjust the investment structure, maintain a reasonable ratio of productive to non-productive investment, and ensure the momentum of economic development; non-productive investment, especially the construction of office buildings, should be strictly controlled, but a certain proportion of residential construction investment should be guaranteed to gradually improve the living conditions of the people. The growth of the consumption fund should be controlled within a reasonable level, and reasonable ratios should be set for the growth rate of national income and the growth rate of the consumption fund, the ratio of new national income used for consumption and accumulation, and the ratio of labor productivity growth to the average income growth of employees. In summary, while striving to achieve a basic balance between total supply and total demand, it is necessary to ensure sufficient accumulation and gradually improve the living standards of the people. To this end, it is necessary to appropriately increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income to not less than 28-30%; appropriately increase the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue to ensure the needs of national key construction and social development; and adjust the initial distribution of national income, reasonably set the proportion of enterprise retained profits used for production development funds, reward funds, and welfare funds, ensure that enterprises have sufficient accumulation, and correct the consumption bias.

Money Supply and Credit Scale: During the period of controlling inflation, correctly determining the growth rate of the money supply is a crucial financial policy. According to the usual formula, the growth rate of the money supply should be equal to the sum of the economic growth rate and the price increase rate. However, in an inflationary environment, determining the growth rate of the money supply according to this formula is not conducive to curbing the momentum of inflation and may even exacerbate inflation. If the structural price increase component in the price increase is considered, determining the growth rate of the money supply according to the sum of the economic growth rate and the structural price increase is more reasonable; however, since the money supply base already contains inflation factors, determining the growth rate of the money supply on such a large money supply base is still too high. Therefore, in recent years, the growth rate of the money supply should be lower than the sum of the economic growth rate and the structural price increase to absorb excess money. To ensure that the money supply does not exceed the planned target, it is necessary to strictly control the scale of bank credit, rectify financial companies, and adjust the credit structure according to the requirements of industrial policy. If the loan scale is out of control and loans exceed deposits, it will force banks to issue more money. If there are too many financial companies, they will draw a large amount of funds originally used for specialized bank loans, and since specialized banks bear some policy-based loans from the state, it will force the central bank to increase money issuance. To reduce the pressure of money issuance, it is necessary to focus on savings, which is a more effective measure than issuing stocks and bonds. To this end, it is necessary to improve the value-preservation measures for term deposits and appropriately increase interest rates. In the long term, the negative interest rate situation must be gradually resolved to enable interest rates to play the role of a comprehensive regulatory tool. Increasing deposit interest rates can increase money withdrawal, reduce cash circulation, ease inflationary pressure, and promote the balance of the consumer goods market. Increasing loan interest rates will indeed increase the production costs of enterprises, but it can to some extent limit investment demand, forcing enterprises with good economic benefits to use funds more reasonably, while enterprises with low or negative economic benefits will feel real pressure, which is conducive to compressing low-efficiency or ineffective investments and production. For enterprises that need to be developed but currently have insufficient economic benefits, the state can use financial subsidies and differential interest rates to provide support.

Effective Supply: The current economic environment adjustment is actually an economic adjustment. This adjustment should focus on adjusting the industrial structure, and make great efforts to adjust the investment structure, distribution structure, and consumption structure, and strive to increase effective supply, so that the adjusted national economy can operate on a more reasonable structural basis, avoiding the situation of having to adjust again a few years later. This is the fundamental aspect of improving macroeconomic efficiency. The main problems with China's current industrial structure are: the general processing industry is too large, and the basic industry is insufficient; agricultural production, mainly grain production, has been stagnant for many years, affecting the production of light textile enterprises and many market-scarce consumer goods; the growth of energy and raw material production still cannot meet the needs of various aspects. The regional structure is also unreasonable, with a relatively serious trend of homogenization, mainly in some coastal regions that should focus on deep processing and higher-level industries but have developed a considerable number of rough processing industries; some inland regions that should focus on resource development and have the conditions to engage in some rough processing have developed a considerable number of rough processing industries regardless of the conditions. Adjusting the industrial structure, in the long term, requires formulating a scientifically based industrial policy and compiling a long-term plan for industrial structure adjustment. In the short term, it is necessary to start from easing the contradiction between total demand and total supply, focus on departments that need and can actually increase effective supply, and provide strong support in terms of funds, materials, etc., to accelerate their development. In this way, it is possible to prevent economic stagflation during the process of economic growth rate decline.

Import and Export Scale, Structure, and International Balance of Payments: The scale and structure of imports and exports have a significant impact on the supply and demand situation of the domestic market and fiscal balance. It is crucial to reasonably determine the proportion of China's total imports and exports to the gross national product at the current stage. It is necessary to strive to find the scale and structure of imports and exports that are most beneficial or optimal for China's economic development, so that the import scale matches the foreign exchange earning capacity, the scale and structure of imports and exports match the development of domestic industries, and are coordinated with the scale and repayment capacity of utilizing foreign capital and borrowing foreign debts. According to the World Bank's "1988 World Development Report," in 1987, China's long-term foreign debt accounted for 7% of the gross domestic product, and the per capita foreign debt rate was relatively low. However, China's early 1990s will enter the peak period of debt repayment, and if the scale and growth rate of borrowing (especially short-term debt) are not controlled, it will bring new difficulties to economic development.

Correctly Using Macroeconomic Control Methods and Effectively Achieving Comprehensive Balance

To achieve the main targets of macroeconomic control, it is necessary to correctly choose the methods and means of macroeconomic control. It seems that the two regulatory methods of planning and market will coexist in China's economic life for a long time, and we should follow the requirements of the new economic operation mechanism of "state regulation of the market, market guidance of enterprises" to organically combine the two. During the transition period of the economic model, economic, administrative, legal, disciplinary, and ideological education methods should not be neglected. However, economic methods should be used as much as possible instead of administrative methods. Due to the underdeveloped market, direct planning methods that must be used should have economic basis, and administrative methods that must be used should also have economic basis, and be standardized and legalized. With the improvement of the economic environment and the formation of an organized and led market, administrative methods should be reduced to the minimum. As some comrades have said, in the long run, it is necessary to study the current regulatory methods, which ones are suitable for the requirements of socialized large-scale production and should be maintained for a long time; which ones are to gradually disappear or be replaced by new mechanisms, although they currently have relatively strong regulatory functions; and which ones are new mechanisms that are growing, although their current regulatory effects are relatively weak, but need to be carefully cultivated, improved, and developed. Making the above distinctions is to prevent the temporary strengthening of regulatory mechanisms without long-term vitality from being solidified, so as to facilitate the overall transition from the old mechanism to the new mechanism.

To make various regulatory methods effectively act on regulatory targets, it is necessary to take good comprehensive balance as a prerequisite. Achieving a good comprehensive balance of the national economy is a requirement of modern large-scale production, a requirement of developing a planned commodity economy, and an urgent need for the current and near-term economic environment adjustment, economic order rectification, and comprehensive deepening of reforms. Strengthening the comprehensive balance of the national economy requires not only balancing finance, credit, materials, foreign exchange, and the market individually, but also balancing finance, credit, foreign exchange, funds, and materials, and the balance between social purchasing power and market commodity supply. It is necessary to balance both planned funds and materials and the overall balance of the entire society including non-planned funds and materials; it is necessary to balance both the national balance and the balance between regions, and to properly coordinate the two balances, avoiding leaving gaps or leaving gaps to local authorities. By doing a good job in the above multi-faceted balance coordination, it is possible to grasp the overall situation of economic development, timely discover unstable factors affecting the healthy operation of the economy, scientifically predict and envision the prospects of economic development, and take effective measures to ensure the sustained and stable growth of the national economy, create a good economic environment for reforms, and promote the smooth and coordinated transition of economic models including the system model, growth model, and industrial structure.

　　经济模式转换中的宏观调控
    王积业
    宏观调控要协调改革与发展的关系
    这里讲的经济模式，主要是指经济体制模式、经济增长模式和产业结构模式，至于所有制模式、企业模式、市场模式等虽然也属于经济模式，因篇幅所限，不多考察。这些经济模式的转换，都与宏观调控息息相关。如果孤立地研究经济体制模式转换时期的宏观调控，由于不能同经济增长模式的转换和产业结构演进妥善衔接，往往使宏观调控顾此失彼，不容易使改革与发展得到有机的结合。基于这种考虑，我们把宏观调控放在经济模式转换时期的广阔范围内加以考察。
    我国经济体制模式的转换将经历比较长的时间。双重经济体制并存带来的矛盾和摩擦不可避免地日益尖锐起来。与此同时，经济发展模式也开始转换。其中经济增长模式，从速度与效益的关系上说，正在从速度型为主转向效益型为主；从社会主义扩大再生产方式上说，正在从外延型为主转向内涵型为主；从经济管理方式上说，正在从粗放型为主转向集约型为主。经济增长模式转换的难度相当大。经济发展中产业结构的转换更为复杂。我国的社会主义建设已经走过了近四十年的路程，形成了相当规模的物质技术基础，拥有门类比较齐全的工业体系。由于人口增长和劳动力就业特别是农村剩余劳动力转移的沉重压力，以及轻工业发展相对缓慢，发展劳动密集型产业势在必行；而我国又处在加强能源、基础原材料建设的阶段，还要有重点地发展高技术产业，这就使我国产业结构转换进程面临着与其他发展中国家不同的任务和要求，显现出新的矛盾和冲突。
    上述经济体制模式、经济增长模式和产业结构模式的转换，既有各自的矛盾，又交互发生影响和制约，集中表现为改革与发展的矛盾。这就要求经济模式转换时期的宏观调控，不仅要正确处理上述三种模式转换中各自的矛盾，而且还要协调三种模式的转换，使它们互相促进而不是彼此牵制。为此，要抓住三种模式转换进程中矛盾的焦点或结合点，协调好改革与发展的关系。这牵扯问题很多，而最重要的一是正确选择宏观调控目标，二是加强和改善国民经济综合平衡，这是当前和今后一个时期加强和改善宏观调控的基本方面。
    正确选择宏观调控目标
    正确选择宏观调控目标，关系国民经济全局的稳定和长远健康发展，因此要把握住影响宏观经济景气的基本因素。这些因素体现为下列一些宏观调控目标。
    通货膨胀率。根据我国有关统计资料，参照发展中国家的经验数据，应该说我国目前已处于中度通货膨胀阶段。治理如此严重的通货膨胀，既要采取紧缩措施力求总量保持平衡，又要大力改善结构，为总量平衡提供牢固的基础。这个任务单靠紧缩政策难以完全奏效。而调整结构，消除瓶颈部门，需要较长的时间，这个问题未得到根本解决之前，通货膨胀的隐患就将长期存在。党中央和国务院提出今年物价上涨率要明显低于去年，这是一项严峻的经济任务，也是一项严肃的政治任务。而通过物价上涨幅度逐年减缓，基本消除通货膨胀，比如把物价上涨率控制在３—５％以内，实现基本上无通货膨胀的经济增长，则是需要经过长期努力方能达到的目标。要求太急，是不现实的，也是有害的。
    经济增长率。我国经济增长过热，主要是指工业尤其是一般加工工业增长过快。我国工业增长的基本制约因素，首先是农业。有的研究单位提供的资料表明，一些国家在工业化过程中，农业与工业的增长速度比，在初期阶段为１∶３左右，在中期阶段为１∶２—２．５左右，在后期阶段约为１∶１．５—２。我国处于工业化初期的尾端或中期的起步阶段，农业与工业的增长速度比似应保持在１∶２—２．５左右为宜。今后，我国农业的正常增长大体在４％左右，工业的实际增长率应保持在８—１０％之间。超出这个范围，农业将难以承受工业增长的负担和压力。制约我国工业增长的另一个因素是原材料进口能力。工业增长速度过高，势必增加进口的压力，在出口能力不能适应的情况下，往往会加剧外汇收支的失衡。制约我国工业增长的第三个因素是能源、基础原材料工业的发展状况。这几年我国能源、原材料工业虽有较快的增长，但远远适应不了增长过快的加工工业的需要，导致工业内部比例的失调。正是基于上述判断，需要把加工工业增长率逐步降低到合理水平。
    需求总量。特别要抑制投资和消费需求的过快增长。投资来源于积累，压缩投资势必要求降低积累率。近几年，我国积累率从１９８４年的３１．５％陡升到１９８５年的３５．２％，１９８６—１９８７年两年略有回落，但仍保持３４．８％和３４．７％的高水平。考虑到价格因素的影响，积累率不宜压得过低，应当保持在国民收入的３０％左右为宜。在降低积累率、压缩投资需求的同时，特别要注意合理调整投资结构，保持生产性投资与非生产性投资的合理比例，保证经济发展的后劲；非生产性投资尤其是楼堂馆所的建设要严格控制，但要保证一定比例的住宅建设投资，逐步改善群众的居住条件。消费基金的增长要控制在合理水平上，规定合理的国民收入增长率与消费基金增长率的比例，规定新增国民收入中用于消费和积累的比例，规定劳动生产率增长与职工平均收入增长的比例。总之，在努力实现总供给与总需求大体平衡的同时，既要保证有足够的积累，又要使人民生活逐步得到改善。为此，要适当提高财政收入占国民收入的比重，使它不低于２８—３０％；适当提高中央财政占国家财政收入的比重，以确保国家重点建设和社会事业发展的需要。同时要调整国民收入初次分配，合理规定企业留利中用于生产发展基金、奖励基金和福利基金的比例，确保企业留有足够的积累，纠正消费倾斜现象。
    货币供应量和信贷规模。在治理通货膨胀时期，正确规定货币供应量增长率是一项极为重要的金融政策。按照通常的公式，货币供应量增长率应等于经济增长率与物价上涨率之和。然而在通货膨胀的环境中，按此公式确定货币供应量增长率，不利于遏制通货膨胀的势头，甚至会助长通货膨胀的加剧。如果考虑到物价上涨中含有结构性物价上涨的合理成份，按经济增长率加结构性物价上涨之和来确定货币供应量增长率，较上述公式合理一些；但是由于货币供应量基数中已含有通货膨胀因素，在这种偏大的货币供应量基数上这样确定货币供应量增长率，仍显得偏高。如此看来，近几年货币供应量增长率似应低于经济增长率加结构性物价上涨之和，以利于吸收多发的货币。为保证货币供应量不超出计划规定的目标，必须严格控制银行信贷规模，整顿金融性公司，按照产业政策要求调整信贷结构。贷款规模失去控制，贷大于存，势必迫使银行增发货币。金融公司过多，势必把原来用于专业银行贷款的资金大量抽走，由于专业银行承担国家一些政策性贷款，结果会迫使中央银行增加货币投放。为了减少货币发行的压力，当前要着力抓好储蓄，这是比发行股票和债券见效更快的措施。为此，既要完善定期存款保值办法，又要适当提高利率。从长期看，负利率状况必须逐步加以解决，使利率能够发挥综合调节手段的作用。提高存款利率能够增加货币回笼，减少现金流通，减轻通货膨胀压力，促进消费品市场的平衡。提高贷款利率，固然会增加企业的生产成本，但是能在一定程度上限制投资需求，迫使经济效益好的企业更加合理利用资金，而低效益或亏损企业将会感到实实在在的压力，从而有利于压缩低效或无效的投资和生产。对需要发展但目前经济效益仍不够好的企业，国家可以通过财政贴息和差别利率等手段的运用，予以扶持。
    有效供给。当前正在开展的治理经济环境，实际上是一次经济调整。这次调整要把调整产业结构放在突出位置，下大气力调整投资结构、分配结构和消费结构，努力增加有效供给，使调整后的国民经济能在较为合理的结构基础上运行，避免调整几年以后又重新出现被迫调整的局面。这是提高宏观经济效益的根本所在。当前我国产业结构存在的主要问题是：一般加工工业过大，基础工业不足；农业主要是粮食生产连年徘徊，影响轻纺企业和不少市场紧俏消费品的生产；能源、原材料生产的增长仍满足不了多方面的需要。地区结构也不合理，出现了较为严重的趋同化现象，主要是沿海一些地区本来应当着力搞深加工和层次较高的产业，但却发展了相当多的粗加工业；内地一些地区本来应当着力资源开发，有条件的地方可以搞些粗加工，但却不顾条件过多地发展了粗加工业。调整产业结构，从长期来看，要制定出有科学依据的产业政策，编制产业结构调整的长远规划。从近期来看，要从缓和总需求和总供给的矛盾出发，抓住需要而且能够切实增加有效供给的部门，从资金、物资等方面大力支持其加快发展。这样就可以在经济增长率回落过程中，防止出现经济滞胀现象。
    进出口规模、结构和国际收支平衡。进出口规模和结构对国内市场的供求状况和财政平衡有较大的影响，合理确定现阶段我国进出口总额占国民生产总值的比重，是个至关重要的问题。要努力寻找对我国经济发展有利或最佳的进出口规模和结构，使进口规模与出口创汇能力相适应，进出口规模和结构与国内产业的发展相衔接，并与利用外资、借外债的规模和偿还能力相配套。据世界银行《１９８８年世界发展报告》，１９８７年中国的长期外债占国内生产总值的７％，人均负外债率较低。然而，我国９０年代初期将进入还本付息高峰，如果放松对借债（特别是短期债务）规模和增长速度的控制，将会给经济发展带来新的困难。
    正确运用宏观调控方式，切实搞好综合平衡
    实现宏观调控的主要目标，必须正确选择宏观调控的方式和手段。看来，计划和市场两种调节方式在我国经济生活中将长期并存下去，我们要遵循“国家调控市场，市场引导企业”新的经济运行机制的要求，切实把两者有机地结合起来。在经济模式转换时期，经济的、行政的、法律的、纪律和思想教育手段都不可偏废。不过，能运用经济手段的要尽量不用行政手段。由于市场不够发育成熟，必须运用直接计划手段的要有经济依据，必须运用行政手段的也要有经济依据，而且要规范化、法律化。随着经济环境的改善和有组织有领导的市场的形成，要把行政手段减少到最低限度。正像有的同志所说，从长远来看，要研究现在运用的调控手段中，哪些是适应社会化大生产要求的，宜长期保持下去；哪些是要逐渐消亡或被新机制替代的，尽管当前还有较强的调控功能；哪些是正在生长起来的新机制，尽管目前调控作用还较弱，但是需要细心培植、完善和发展。做出上述区分，为的是防止把眼前需要强化但无长久生命力的调控机制凝固起来，以利于在整体上从旧机制向新机制的过渡。
    要使各种调控手段有效地作用于调控目标，必须以搞好综合平衡为前提条件。搞好国民经济综合平衡，是现代化大生产的需要，是发展有计划商品经济的需要，也是近期治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革的迫切需要。加强国民经济综合平衡，既要做好财政、信贷、物资、外汇和市场各自的平衡，更要做好财政、信贷、外汇之间的平衡，资金与物资之间的平衡，以及社会购买力和市场商品可供量之间的平衡。既要搞好计划内资金和物资的平衡，又要搞好包括计划外的资金和物资在内的全社会的平衡；既要搞好全国范围内的平衡，又要搞好地区与地区之间的平衡，并把两种平衡妥善衔接起来，切忌留缺口或把缺口留给地方。做好上述多方面的平衡衔接，就有可能总揽经济发展全局，及时发现影响经济健康运行的不稳定因素，有科学依据地预测和展望经济发展的前景，有针对性地采取得力措施来保证国民经济持续稳定增长，为改革创造出良好的经济环境，推进包括体制模式、增长模式和产业结构在内的经济模式顺利协调地进行转换。
