A waitress in a restaurant was hospitalized for over five months due to illness. Initially, the company did not reimburse her medical expenses. After the commercial trade union insisted, only 80% of the expenses were reimbursed, but no salary was paid during her sick leave. How should the labor insurance and welfare benefits of employees be guaranteed after the implementation of the contract responsibility system?

Some enterprises, in the process of reform, have neglected or infringed upon the legal rights of employees, abolished or significantly reduced labor insurance benefits, and affected the enthusiasm of employees for production. For this reason, the State Economic Restructuring Commission, the State Economic Commission, the Ministry of Labor and Personnel, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions jointly issued a notice, forwarding the opinions of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Labor and Personnel and two other departments on guaranteeing the insurance and welfare benefits of employees in state-owned enterprises after implementing the contract and lease system. The notice proposes that state-owned enterprises, especially small industrial and commercial enterprises, should pay attention to guaranteeing the insurance and welfare benefits that employees should enjoy when implementing various forms of contract and lease responsibility systems, so as to mobilize the enthusiasm of employees for production and ensure the smooth progress of the reform. The main spirit of the opinions of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Labor and Personnel and two other departments on guaranteeing the insurance and welfare benefits of employees in state-owned enterprises after implementing the contract and lease system is: the contractors and lessees of contract and lease enterprises should include the implementation of labor insurance and welfare system regulations in the contract and lease contracts, and guarantee the legal rights of employees. When reforming and experimenting with certain irrational contents in the labor insurance system, it should be discussed and approved by the trade union congress or the democratic management group of employees and reported to the superior competent department for approval.

Therefore, to do a good job in the reform of the labor insurance system, local governments and labor departments should, in accordance with the national labor insurance policy regulations, interpret the labor insurance laws and regulations, handle employee complaints, and supervise and inspect the implementation of enterprise labor insurance regulations. Trade union organizations should actively participate in democratic management and supervision, and safeguard the specific interests of employees. For enterprises that do not include the content of employee labor insurance benefits in the contract and lease contracts, the superior competent departments should help them to supplement this aspect as soon as possible. For those contractors and lessees who seriously infringe upon the legal rights of employees and insist on not correcting them, the superior competent departments and relevant government departments should take effective measures to protect the legal rights of employees.

　　承包租赁企业应注意保护职工合法权益
    问：一饭店服务员因病住院５个多月，开始单位不给报销药费，后经商业工会坚持意见，才报销８０％，但病假期间不给开工资。请问，在实行承包经营责任制后，如何保障职工的劳保福利待遇？
    　黑龙江大兴安岭地区总工会　费苏
    答：有一些企业，在改革中忽视或损害了职工的合法权益，取消或大幅度降低了职工的劳动保险待遇，影响职工生产积极性。为此，国家体改委、经委、劳动人事部、全国总工会联合发通知，转发了四川省劳动人事厅等三部门《关于国营企业实行承包租赁以后保障职工保险福利待遇的意见》，并在通知中提出，国营企业，特别是国营小型工业企业和商业企业在推行承包、租赁等多种形式的经营责任制中，应注意保障职工应享受的保险福利待遇，以调动职工的生产积极性，保证改革的顺利进行。四川省劳动人事厅等三个部门《关于国营企业实行承包租赁以后保障职工保险福利待遇的意见》的主要精神是：承包、租赁企业的承包、租赁者，应把执行劳动保险、福利制度规定，纳入承包租赁合同，保证职工的合法权益。对于劳动保险制度中某些不合理的内容进行改革试验时，应经过职代会或职工民主管理小组讨论通过，报上级主管部门批准。
    因此，搞好职工劳动保险制度的改革，地方政府、劳动部门应根据国家劳动保险政策规定，解释劳动保险法令，受理职工申诉，督促检查企业劳动保险法规的执行。工会组织应积极参与民主管理和监督，维护职工的具体利益。对于在承包、租赁合同中没有纳入职工劳动保险待遇内容的企业，上级主管部门应帮助他们尽快补充此方面内容，对于那些严重侵犯职工合法权益并执意不予纠正的承包、租赁者，上级主管部门以及政府有关部门应采取有效措施，保护职工合法权益。
