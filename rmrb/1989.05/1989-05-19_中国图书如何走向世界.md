	How to Make Chinese Books Go Global
		By Zhang Zhujie, People's Daily Reporter

	China's reform and opening-up policy require us to continuously expand our two-way exchanges with the world. Books are a bridge to mutual understanding. However, it has been revealed by relevant personnel that in the past 10 years, the total value of China's book trade has accumulated to only 4 billion yuan, which is a significant gap compared to countries like the UK, the US, France, and the Soviet Union. Moreover, China's book trade is characterized by more imports than exports.

	How can Chinese books go global?

	The Competitive International Book Market

	Currently, the world publishes approximately 600,000 new books each year. The US and the Soviet Union publish the most, each with around 70,000 to 80,000 new books, followed by West Germany with over 60,000 new books. China publishes around 45,000 new books annually, slightly more than the UK and France. However, most Chinese books are for domestic readers, while the global book market is dominated by countries like the UK, the US, France, Spain, and West Germany. The UK is the primary exporter of English books, with about 40-50% of its publications exported worldwide. France also exports approximately one-third of its books abroad.

	Like other international markets, the competition in the global book market is fierce. These book giants not only export finished books but also establish publishing subsidiaries overseas. For example, Spain has 13 publishing subsidiaries in South America alone. In this context, some medium and small publishers have joined forces to form international publishing groups, leveraging their information advantages and wide reach. They print one version in multiple languages to increase print runs, reduce production costs, and boost economic benefits, thereby competing with large publishing companies. The MOTO Publishing Group Association, which held its annual meeting in China in early May, is an example of such a group. This association currently has 87 member publishers, most of which are medium and small publishers from Western Europe. The China National Publications Import and Export Corporation is also a member of this association.

	International Co-Publishing: A Practical Approach

	For a long time, China's book trade has primarily relied on the China International Bookstore and the China National Publications Import and Export Corporation. The China National Publications Import and Export Corporation, established in 1980, became the third institution to engage in this business. Since 1978, China's book exports to Japan and some Southeast Asian countries and regions have made some progress, but they have not yet truly entered the European and American book markets. Due to the limitations of the associated distributors, the foreign-language books we export do not enter major bookstores in those countries, and Chinese-language books are mainly found in small bookshops in Chinatowns. The main reason is that Chinese books often do not meet the needs and consumption habits of Europeans and Americans in terms of topics, writing, or layout.

	Practice over the past few decades has shown that co-publishing is an effective way to promote Chinese books globally. Specifically, Chinese and foreign publishers jointly decide on topics, with the Chinese side providing images and materials, and both sides collaborating on editing and publishing. This approach utilizes the foreign distribution channels to promote Chinese books, expanding their reach. For example, large-format picture books like "China," "Tibet," "The Long March," and "The Great Wall" have been published in seven or more languages, with print runs exceeding 100,000 copies. According to industry insiders, the domestic market for these high-value books is limited to no more than 3,000 copies.

	Activating Book Import and Export Trade

	For a long time, domestic publishers have focused solely on the domestic market, considering only the needs of domestic readers. To promote Chinese books globally and enhance global understanding of China, our publishing professionals must consider the needs of foreign readers. To achieve this, they must broaden their horizons and stand on the level of global culture to make good topic selections.

	Currently, while the co-publishing approach can provide some insights into the international book market, a long-term solution requires strengthening market research to gain the initiative. Local publishers generally have few opportunities to consider the international book market or interact with foreign publishers. The research capabilities of national-level institutions are also insufficient, and coordinating and communicating information is another challenge.

	It is necessary to cultivate a corresponding team for book trade. Some domestic publishers are still unfamiliar with international book trade practices, and even the concepts of copyright transfer and co-publishing are not well understood.

	To facilitate negotiations, it is common international practice to showcase mock-ups of unpublished books. However, many publishers do not pay attention to this. Some excellent books have missed potential export opportunities due to the lack of foreign language descriptions. To address these issues, the key is to have a professional team for book trade. Some individuals involved in international book trade are good at editing books but not at business. Ideal book trade professionals should be knowledgeable, fluent in foreign languages, and well-informed.

	Some leaders of domestic publishers have called for the timely introduction of publishing laws as the book trade develops.

	Book trade is a form of trade that requires both imports and exports, not just one-way traffic. Generally, publishers lack the foreign exchange to purchase good books from others, which sometimes affects the export of their own good books. This is also an issue.

	Foreigners visiting China often cannot even buy Chinese-published foreign-language books about themselves, while such books published by other countries are readily available elsewhere. This phenomenon has been criticized by foreign publishers as a loss of a significant market share. This criticism is worth our consideration.

### 中国图书如何走向世界

　　中国图书如何走向世界
    本报记者  张祝基
    中国的改革与对外开放，要求我们不断扩大同世界的双向交流，图书是增进相互了解的桥梁。可是，据有关人士披露，最近１０年，我国图书外贸总额累计仅４０亿元人民币，同英、美、法、苏等国相比差距很大。而且，我国图书外贸是进口超过出口。
    中国图书如何走向世界？
    竞争激烈的国际图书市场
    目前全世界每年出版新书大约有６０万种，其中美、苏最多，各为七八万种，西德次之，有６万多种，我国每年出新书大约４．５万种，略高于英、法。可是，我国的图书主要供应国内读者，而世界图书市场主要被英、美、法、西班牙和西德等国占领。英国是英文图书的主要输出国，它所出版的图书有百分之四五十出口世界，法国也有大约１／３的图书输往国外。
    同其他国际市场一样，世界图书市场上的竞争也是激烈的。那些图书大国不仅向外出口成书，而且还在国外开办出版分公司。例如西班牙，仅在南美洲就有１３家出版分公司。在这种形势下，一些中小出版社联合起来，组成国际性的出版集团，发挥其信息灵通、广泛的优势，并把一个版本用多种语文翻印，以扩大印量、降低生产成本、增加经济效益，来同那些大出版公司抗争。今年５月上旬在我国举行年会的莫托文出版集团协会就是一个这种性质的团体。这个协会目前成员有８７家出版社，其中绝大多数是西欧中小出版社，中国出版对外贸易总公司也是该协会成员。
    国际合作出版可借船过河
    我国图书外贸长期以来主要依靠中国国际书店和中国图书进出口总公司经营，１９８０年成立的中国出版对外贸易总公司成为开展这项业务的第三个机构。１９７８年以来，中国图书对日本和东南亚一些国家和地区的出口取得了一定的进展，但却远未真正打入欧美图书市场。由于所联系的发行商自身的局限性，我们出口到这些国家的外文图书进不了人家的大书店，中文图书则主要摆在唐人街的小书铺里。究其原因，主要是中国图书在选题、写作或编排等方面多不适合欧美人的需求和消费习惯。
    近十几年来的实践表明，合作出版不失为推动中国图书走向世界的一条有效途径。具体说，就是中外出版社共同商定题目，中方提供图片和资料，双方合作编辑出版，利用人家的发行渠道将中国图书打出去。这样做的好处是，选题出书可避免盲目性，成书切合外国读者的口味，最后还可借船过河地流入国际图书市场，拓宽销路。例如采用合作出版方式推出的《中国》、《西藏》、《长征》、《钢铁长城》等大型画册，都有７种以上文本，发行量都超过１０万册。据出版界人士估计，上述那些价值很高的图书，国内图书市场的容量最多不超过３０００册。
    把图书进出口贸易做活
    我国内向性的出版社长期以来眼睛只盯着国内，只考虑为国内读者服务的问题。为把中国图书推向世界，促进世界了解中国，我国的出版工作者们必须适当考虑外国读者的需求。为此，他们就得放宽眼界，站在全人类文化的高度，这样才能作出好的选题。
    目前看，通过合作出版途径虽然可以了解到一些国际图书市场的情况，但从长远看，必须加强对国际图书市场的调研才能掌握主动。地方出版社一般都少有考虑国际图书市场、甚至同外国出版家交往的机会。国家级机构的调研力量也嫌不足，如何协调沟通信息更是个问题。
    要培养一支相应的图书外贸队伍。国内一些出版社对国际上通用的图书贸易做法还感到陌生，甚至对什么是版权转让、合作出版也不甚了然。
    为方便洽谈，要展示未成书的模拟本，这本是国际图书贸易惯常的做法，但许多出版社对此并未重视。有些很好的图书，由于没有外文说明而丢失了可能的出口机会。要解决这些问题，关键是要有一支图书外贸专业队伍。有些参加对外图书贸易的人编书是好手，做买卖却不在行。理想的图书外贸人员应该业务熟、会外语、信息灵。
    一些国内出版社负责同志普遍呼吁，随着我国图书外贸的开展，出版法的出台应及早提到日程上来。
    图书外贸既然是一种贸易，就得有来有往，而不可能只出不进。一般出版社由于没有外汇买进人家的好书，有时候也影响把自己的好书销出去。这也是个问题。
    外国人来到中国，甚至买不到中国出的关于自己的外文版图书，而在别国由其他国家出版的这类图书却几乎随处可寻。这种现象被外国出版家指出是丧失了很重要的一部分市场。这种批评值得我们深思。
