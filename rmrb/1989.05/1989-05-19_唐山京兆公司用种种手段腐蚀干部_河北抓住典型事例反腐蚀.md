The Communist Party of China's Hebei Provincial Committee recently discussed the serious economic crime case involving Wu Zhenhua and others at the Tangshan Jingzhao Company, sounding another alarm for Party members and cadres to combat corruption.

Wu Zhenhua, the manager of Jingzhao Company, had a criminal record even before taking the position. After becoming the manager, he focused on illegal activities such as selling steel, amassing nearly 10 million yuan in illicit profits in less than three years. Wu personally embezzled nearly 5 million yuan and used various means to lure and corrupt Party and government officials as well as personnel from the news and propaganda departments. Statistics show that over two years, 117 officials received benefits from Wu, including 26 Party members, spanning 72 organizations, with a total amount of 3.7 million yuan. These officials, after receiving money, used their power to provide convenience for Wu, engaging in dirty power-for-money deals.

Wu Zhenhua has now been arrested by law, and the Jingzhao Company has been sealed off. The Hebei Provincial Committee requires Party members and cadres to use this negative example to heighten their awareness of the importance of combating corruption in the new situation, enhance their immunity and combat power against various improper practices and corrupt phenomena, and promote the construction of a clean government throughout the province.

　　唐山京兆公司用种种手段腐蚀干部    
    河北抓住典型事例反腐蚀
    本报石家庄５月１９日电  记者陈国琦报道：中共河北省委最近讨论了以吴振华为首的唐山京兆公司严重经济犯罪案件，再一次对党员干部敲响反腐蚀的警钟。
    京兆公司经理吴振华有犯罪前科，任经理后，一直把倒卖钢材等作为主要经营业务，不到３年就非法获利近百万元。吴个人侵吞近５０万元，还用种种手段，拉拢、腐蚀党政干部及新闻宣传部门人员。据统计，两年多来，从吴振华那里得到好处的干部１１７人，其中党员２６人，涉及７２个单位，款额达３７万多元。这些人得了钱，就用权为吴提供方便，进行肮脏的权钱交易。
    现在，吴振华已被依法逮捕，京兆公司也被查封。河北省委要求党员、干部利用这个反面典型，提高对在新形势下开展反腐蚀斗争重要性的认识，增强对各种不正之风和各种腐败现象的免疫力和战斗力，推进全省廉政建设。
