Afghan Mujahideen Refuse to Attend National Assembly

The interim government of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance, headed by Prime Minister Rasul Sayyaf, has refused to attend the National Assembly convened by the Kabul authorities.

The Kabul government invited all opposition groups and military leaders of the Mujahideen, both inside and outside Afghanistan, to participate in this traditional National Assembly, composed of 520 members, on May 20th, to decide on the most important issues facing the country.

The Afghan News Agency reported today that Sayyaf said in a telephone interview with the agency on May 20th that this was a "propaganda offensive" by the Kabul authorities.
