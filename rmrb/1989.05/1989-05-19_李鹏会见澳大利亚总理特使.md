	Li Peng met with the Australian Prime Minister's special envoy, Woollcott, this afternoon at the Zhongnanhai Purple Light Hall. Li Peng asked Woollcott, "Did you come to Zhongnanhai through the normal route today?" The Australian Ambassador to China, Shadwick, said they had come through a small alley. Li Peng said: This incident shows that Beijing has been in chaos. This chaos has spread to varying degrees to other regions. The Chinese government will take responsible measures to stop the chaos, restore normal social order, and ensure the smooth implementation of our reform and opening-up policy. This is purely China's internal affair. We will handle this matter properly. I am confident about this.

	Woollcott, the special envoy, briefed Li Peng on Australian Prime Minister Hawke's proposal in January this year in Seoul regarding the development of regional economic cooperation and some specific ideas.

	Li Peng said that as an Asia-Pacific country, China has the opportunity to exchange views on economic development issues with other countries in the region, which is beneficial. However, when discussing Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, we should consider the differences in social systems and development levels. He expressed support for holding a ministerial-level meeting attended by sovereign states to consult on economic development in the region, which might be more acceptable to all countries.

	Both sides expressed their willingness to continue consultations on related issues of the ministerial-level meeting in the future.

	Li Peng also expressed his anticipation of Prime Minister Hawke's visit to China again in October this year.

　　李鹏会见澳大利亚总理特使
    本报北京５月１９日讯  国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了澳大利亚总理特使伍尔科特。李鹏问伍尔科特特使：“你今天是不是通过正常路线来到中南海的？”澳大利亚驻我国大使沙德维说，他们是穿小胡同来到这里的。李鹏说：这件事说明北京发生了混乱。这个混乱已经不同程度地蔓延到其他一些地区。中国政府将以负责的态度采取措施来制止混乱，恢复正常的社会秩序，保证我们的改革、开放政策的顺利进行。这纯属中国的内政。我们将妥善解决这件事情。对此，我充满信心。
    伍尔科特特使向李鹏介绍了澳大利亚总理霍克今年１月在汉城提出的关于发展区域经济合作的建议及一些具体设想。
    李鹏说，作为亚太国家，中国有机会就发展经济问题同本地区其他国家交换意见是有益的。但在讨论亚太经济合作时，要考虑到社会制度不同、发展水平各有差异等特点。他表示支持先举行一次主权国家参加的部长级会议，就本地区经济发展进行协商，这样也许更能为各国所接受。
    双方表示愿意今后继续就部长级会议的有关问题进一步磋商。
    李鹏还表示他期待着霍克总理今年１０月再次访华。
