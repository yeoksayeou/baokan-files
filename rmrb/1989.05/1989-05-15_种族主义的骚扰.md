Over the past few months, the entrance of the United Church on Pitt Street in the heart of Sydney has been the scene of repeated disturbances. The church's steps and doors have been defaced almost every week with black oil, making them repulsive to look at. Additionally, windows have been smashed with bricks, tires of cars parked in the church lot have been slashed, threatening phone calls have been made at night, and even human excrement has been thrown at the homes of church clergy. These incidents, occurring in Oceania, have drawn attention.

According to reports, all these incidents are directed at the church's pastor, Ms. McMahon. She has consistently supported the African National Congress in South Africa and the rights of indigenous people. Two years ago, the church invited the famous South African Archbishop Tutu to give a speech, which touched a nerve with racists, leading to the aforementioned series of terrorist acts.

Last November, the situation reached a boiling point. Racist elements brazenly placed a burning effigy of a woman with a tire around her neck outside Ms. McMahon's home, using it to insult and threaten her. Ms. Maos, a member of the Federal Commission for Racial Discrimination, revealed that over 100 racist incidents have been identified, but the actual number is likely higher. Ms. Maos also pointed out that a survey showed that 75% of racist violence incidents go unreported.

The group harassing the church is an Australian organization that supports South African apartheid, with close ties to right-wing groups such as the "Australian National Movement" and "National Action." These racist organizations openly advocate for a "White Australia" immigration policy and use cowardly tactics to harm Asian immigrants, indigenous people, anti-apartheid activists, and politicians and journalists who oppose racial discrimination.

Australia is primarily composed of immigrants, with only about 160,000 indigenous people, making up 1.1% of the total population. Two hundred years ago, Europeans began settling in Australia. After World War II, about 4 million people from over 120 ethnicities from Europe, Asia, and other regions moved to Australia.

Although Australia's racist terrorist acts occur in specific regions, they have attracted societal attention. Many people have pointed out that if such racist harassment and discrimination are allowed to continue without intervention, the situation will only worsen.

### 种族主义的骚扰

　　种族主义的骚扰
    几个月来，澳大利亚悉尼市闹市区的皮特街联合教堂门前屡生是非，教堂的台阶和大门几乎每周都被黑色污油涂抹得面目全非，令人作呕；还有人用砖头砸教堂的窗户、把停放在教堂停车场的汽车轮胎扎破、夜间打恐吓电话，甚至向教堂神职人员家门泼撒人粪尿等等，这类事件竟发生在大洋洲，引起了人们的关注。
    据报道，这一切都是针对该教堂牧师麦克马洪女士的。她一贯支持南非非洲人国民大会和土著人的权利。两年前，这个教堂曾邀请南非著名大主教图图来此演讲。这触动了种族主义的神经，因而导致了上述一系列的恐怖行为。
    去年１１月，事态发展到了忍无可忍的地步。种族主义分子明目张胆地在麦克马洪家门外放火烧掉了一个脖颈上套着轮胎的女人模拟像，以此对她进行肆意侮辱和威胁。负责全国调查的联邦种族歧视委员会委员毛斯女士披露，已发现的种族主义事件已有１００多起，而实际上并不止于此。毛斯还指出，一项调查表明，７５％的种族主义暴力行为发生后没有人去报告。
    骚扰教堂的是澳大利亚亲南非种族主义的一个组织，与“澳大利亚全国运动”、“全国行动”等右翼团体有密切联系，这些种族主义组织公开鼓吹“白澳大利亚”移民政策，并用“打了就跑”的卑鄙伎俩加害于亚洲移民、土著人、反种族隔离主义者以及反种族歧视的政治家和新闻记者。
    澳大利亚基本上是由移民组成的国家，土著人只有１６万多人，占澳大利亚总人口的１．１％。２００年前，欧洲人开始到澳大利亚定居。第二次世界大战后，欧、亚等地的１２０多个民族约４００万人移居澳大利亚。
    澳大利亚的种族恐怖行为尽管发生在局部地区，但已引起了社会的关注。不少人士指出，如果容忍这种种族骚扰和歧视行为继续发展下去而不采取措施加以制止，则事态将更加严重。
