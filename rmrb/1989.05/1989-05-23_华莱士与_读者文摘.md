The 1920s was a decade when short stories and serialized novels flourished. Therefore, it is not surprising that when a young man from St. Paul, Minnesota, published the world's first non-fiction "Reader's Digest," he was ridiculed by the publishing industry. This young man was DeWitt Wallace, who at the time was writing sales advertisements for the Weber Publishing Company.

Wallace's first digest was a 124-page booklet titled "Maximizing Profits from Agriculture," which collected the titles and summaries of free government booklets. To his surprise, it sold 100,000 copies in no time! During World War I, he was severely injured and spent four months on leave. During this period, he applied his talent for summarizing to a new field—condensing articles from popular magazines into lively, simple, and easy-to-read prose. After returning home, Wallace compiled his best articles into a sample magazine, which he named "Reader's Digest." However, no publisher was willing to accept it. These publishers laughed at a magazine that had no fiction, no advertisements or artwork, and only carried serious articles. But there was one person who did not laugh—his classmate Lila Bell Cheney. They got married on October 15, 1921, in New York, and after their honeymoon, they started their magazine in the basement of an illegal bar in Greenwich Village. The entire capital for this adventurous venture was a borrowed $1,800. The first issue of "Reader's Digest" had a print run of only 5,000 copies, but it quickly sold out. The content of this magazine was carefully selected and condensed from famous publications such as "Scribner's," "Atlantic Monthly," "The American," and "Saturday Evening Post."

Today, Wallace's "Reader's Digest" has become one of the most widely distributed periodicals in the world, with a circulation of 18.3 million in the United States and 11.7 million abroad, published in 15 languages and 39 editions, its global sales have caught up with the Bible. Since its inception, "Reader's Digest" has changed little. To this day, the editorial policy of the magazine when it was founded still applies: an article must (1) be of particular value to the reader; (2) have enduring interest; (3) be constructive.

The success of "Reader's Digest" made the Wallaces famous worldwide and brought them enormous wealth, their names are now listed in the American rich list.

　　华莱士与“读者文摘”
    洪瑞生
    二十世纪二十年代是短篇小说和杂志连载小说盛行的年代。所以当美国圣保罗的一个年轻人推出世界上第一本非小说的《读者文摘》时，遭到出版界的嗤笑也就不足为奇了。这个年轻人就是当时为韦伯出版公司写销售广告的德威特·华莱士。
    华莱士的第一本文摘是名为《最大限度地从农业中获利》的一百二十四页的小册子，里面搜集了政府免费小册子的书名和内容简介。使他大吃一惊的是居然一下子就卖掉了十万册！第一次世界大战时他受了重伤，在四个月的休假期里，他把摘要的普通才能运用到一个新的领域——把大众趣味杂志的文章缩写成充满生气、简单轻松的散文。回到家乡后，华莱士把他最精彩的文章编成一期样品杂志，取名为《读者文摘》。然而没有一家出版社愿意接受，这些出版商对这个没有小说、不登广告或艺术品、专载严肃文章的杂志大笑不已。然而有一个人没笑，她就是华莱士的同学莱拉·贝尔·艾奇逊。他们于一九二一年十月十五日在纽约结婚，度完蜜月便在格林威治村一家非法酒店的地下室里创办了他们的杂志。这次冒险行动的全部资本是借来的一千八百美元。首期《读者文摘》只发行了五千册，但很快就销售一空。这本杂志的内容是从诸如《斯里布克纳》、《大西洋月刊》、《美国》以及《星期六晚邮报》等著名报刊精选压缩的。
    华莱士的《读者文摘》，今天已成为世界传播最为广泛的期刊，在美国发行一千八百三十万份，在国外发行一千一百七十万份，有十五种语言的三十九个版本，其世界范围的销售量已赶上《圣经》。从首期开始，《读者文摘》变化不大，时至今日，该杂志创办时的编辑方针仍旧适用，即一篇文章必须：（一）对读者有特别的作用；（二）有持久的趣味；（三）有建设性。
    《读者文摘》的成功，使华莱士夫妇成为蜚声世界的名人，同时也给他们带来了巨大的财富，他们的名字已列入美国豪富的花名册。
