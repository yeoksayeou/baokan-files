Nanchang in Jiangxi has strengthened management and strictly enforced price policies, leading to a slowdown in price increases this year. Among the 35 major cities nationwide, the price increase index has dropped from the first position in the first quarter of last year to the 32nd position.

While implementing price target control for over 2,000 commodities and non-commodity charges, Nanchang has taken a series of measures to strengthen macro-control over market prices:

	— Stabilize the "vegetable basket." In March, the vegetable production in suburban areas increased by over 3 million kilograms, ensuring a sufficient supply of vegetables in the market. At the same time, the profits of middlemen in the vegetable supply chain were controlled; the sales price of pork in urban and rural markets was managed through price controls.

	— Classify the management of daily industrial consumer goods prices. For enterprises that raise product prices, approval from the price authorities is required. For those subject to market-adjusted prices, the profit rate is controlled.

	— Implement an enterprise pricing permit system for commodities with liberalized prices.

	— Strictly crack down on illegal price hikes and excessive fees in accordance with the law.

　　南昌严格执行价格政策
    物价涨幅回落　恐涨心理趋缓
    本报南昌５月２６日电  江西南昌市由于加强管理、严格执行价格政策，今年物价涨幅开始回落。在全国３５个大中城市中，物价上涨指数的排位已从去年第１季度的第１位降至第３２位。
    在对２０００多种商品价格和非商品收费项目实行价格目标控制的同时，南昌市采取了一系列措施，加强对市场物价的宏观控制：
    ——稳定菜篮子。３月份，市郊蔬菜产量增加３００多万公斤，使市场蔬菜供应充足，同时控制大路菜中间环节的利润；城镇农贸市场猪肉销售价格进行限价管理。
    ——分类管理日用工业消费品价格。凡企业上浮产品价格，必须征得物价部门审批同意。对实行市场调节价的，控制其利润率。
    ——对放开价格的商品实行企业定价许可证制度。
    ——依法严厉打击乱涨价、乱收费等违法行为。
