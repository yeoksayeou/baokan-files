Editor's Note: The State Council's decision on the protective mining of gold mines has been issued for half a year, but the illegal gold mining by individual households in Yù'ěrqī Village has not only not subsided but has become increasingly rampant. This is a matter that deserves attention.

Illegal gold mining by individual households is difficult to stop, which shows that the local government's awareness of acting in accordance with the law is weak. Especially, some cadres openly or secretly support such behavior, which has fueled this wrong trend. Therefore, to effectively stop illegal gold mining by individual households, the key is to improve the legal system, enhance people's legal awareness, and act in accordance with the law.

In a valley adjacent to a state-owned gold mine, individual gold miners' mining points are scattered all over the mountains. Newly excavated pits follow one after another, and tens of thousands of tons of rocks excavated from the mine almost fill the valley. This was a "scene" captured by reporters in Yù'ěrqī Village, Kuānchéng County, Hebei Province not long ago.

Yù'ěrqī is located in the eastern part of the Yánshān Mountains, 200 kilometers west of Beijing and over 100 kilometers south of Tángshān. Historically, this area was famous for its gold production and was known as "Huangjinyu." Even today, the "rouge mine" that was once opened for Cíxǐ still exists. After liberation, the state prohibited private gold mining to protect gold mine resources. In the 1980s, some people rushed to the mining area to make money by mining gold, gradually encroaching on state-owned mines. At first, some local people still mined gold by themselves. Later, it evolved into dividing the land and mines, with each family having a piece. Some people even hired a large number of migrant workers from other counties and provinces to become bosses themselves. In Yù'ěrqī Village, two villages with a hundred or so households hired more than a thousand migrant workers. These migrant workers worked hard in the underground pits without basic safety facilities, earning only a few yuan a day, while the bosses' profits were tens or even hundreds of times higher.

It is found that there are more than 100 pits dug by individual gold miners within the mining area of the state-owned Yù'ěrqī Gold Mine, of which more than 80 directly threaten the state-owned gold mine. There are more than 1,700 people directly mining gold in these pits, and at the peak, there are more than 4,000 people.

During the on-site investigation, reporters found that the newer the pits dug by individual gold miners, the closer they are to the center of the state-owned mining area. Several pits dug after the Spring Festival this year even reached the edge of the state-owned mine's dressing plant. Some people openly mined right under the noses of state-owned mine workers. Among them, one pit was dug near an oil depot of the state-owned gold mine. If something happened, the consequences would be unimaginable.

By plundering state resources and exploiting hired workers, some individual gold miners in this area have become rich in just a few years. Liú Yùróng, who once served as a production team leader, is one of them. At his peak, he hired 120 workers. Since 1985, he has repeatedly ordered people to forcibly enter the state-owned mine's tunnels to mine gold, sometimes stealing 3,000 tons of gold ore at a time, with a metal content of up to 35 kilograms. Liú Yùróng not only mines gold but also set up an underground cyanide gold refining room in his own courtyard. With these, he has now become a millionaire with multiple cars. Another wealthy person is Wáng Fù, who once served as the party branch secretary of the local area. He has repeatedly connected his mine with the state-owned mine's tunnels, stealing gold ore from the state-owned mine. Now that he has become a nouveau riche, he has built a magnificent residence at the gate of the state-owned mine.

In Yù'ěrqī, there is also a famous figure known as "Yáng Bǎiwàn" who is rich and influential. Currently, there are 9 imported cars in his home, including luxury models such as "Crown," "Mercedes-Benz 280," and "Toyota." This person started by trading gold and developed into trading steel and contracting companies. Once, Yáng Bǎiwàn's son, carrying a walkie-talkie and riding in a small car, went to Chéngdé County to trade gold rings and was caught with 40-plus gold rings weighing about 200 grams.

The illegal gold mining here has caused huge losses to the state's gold resources. According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, since 1983, due to reckless mining, the local state-owned mines have lost more than 45,000 tons of ore. The metal content is nearly 600 kilograms, which can supply a small state-owned mine for 3 years. During the same period, the direct value of production facilities and materials destroyed in the state-owned mine has also reached tens of thousands of yuan.

Illegal gold trading activities are also rampant in this area. According to statistics from the regional gold company, from 1986 to 1988, the gold delivered by individual gold miners to the state here decreased from more than 2,000 taels to more than 300 taels. Before the first half of 1988, most of the gold mined by individual gold miners here was smuggled to the southern coastal regions. As the locals say, "One tael to the Communist Party, nine taels to Hong Kong." Since the second half of 1988, with the change in the domestic black market price of gold, the bosses of individual gold mining here have also changed their strategy, no longer selling finished gold products, but storing gold or selling it after processing it into jewelry. Some even simply store high-grade gold ore by using it as a foundation or wall.

The local government has also taken some measures to try to ban illegal individual gold mining and refining activities, but the results have been minimal. The main reason is that the enforcement is not strict. For the behavior of damaging state property, there is no strict prohibition, and some cadres even openly or secretly support such behavior, leading the way in mining and refining gold.

　　“黄金峪”目睹记
    新华社记者  顾洪洪  本报记者  刘燮阳
    编者按　国务院关于对黄金矿实行保护性开采的决定发出半年了，峪耳崖镇的个体户采金不仅没有收敛，反而愈演愈烈，这是应该引起注意的。
    个体户非法采金，有禁难止，这说明，当地政府依法办事的观念淡薄。尤其是少数干部明里暗里支持这种行为，助长了这股歪风。所以，要有效地制止个体户非法采金，主要是健全法制，提高人们的法制观念，依法办事。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    在一条与国营金矿相邻的山谷内，漫山遍野布满了个体采金者的矿点，新开挖的坑口，一个接着一个，成千上万吨从矿内挖出来的石头，几乎填平了山谷。这是不久前记者在河北宽城县峪耳崖镇摄取的“镜头”。
    峪耳崖位于燕山山脉东部，西距北京２００公里，南距唐山１００余公里。历史上这一带就以产金闻名，被称为“黄金峪”。至今，这里还保存着当年为慈禧开的“胭脂矿”。解放后，国家为保护黄金矿资源，禁止私人采金。到了８０年代，一些人为了采金发财，蜂拥矿区，蚕食国营矿山。刚开始，当地一些人还自己动手开矿采金。到后来，演变为划地分矿，一家一块。一些人还大量雇佣外县、外省民工，自己当上了把头。在峪耳崖镇，两个百十户人的村庄，竟雇佣了一两千个民工。这些民工在缺乏基本安全设施的井下，累死累活，一天只能挣几元钱，而把头获利则高出数十倍，甚至数百倍。
    据查，个体采金者在国营峪耳崖金矿矿区范围内开挖的坑口有１００多个，其中８０多个对国营金矿构成了直接威胁。在这些坑口内常年直接采金的有１７００余人，高峰时多达四千余人。
    在实地考察中，记者发现，越是新开挖的个体采金坑口，离国营矿区的中心越近。今年春节后开挖的几个坑口竟打到了国营矿选矿厂的边上，一些人公然在国营矿职工鼻子底下干开了。其中，有一个坑口就开在国营金矿的一个油库近旁，一旦出事，后果不堪设想。
    靠掠夺国家资源、压榨雇工，这一带的一些个体采金者在短短几年内暴富起来。曾任过生产队长的刘玉荣，就是其中之一。他雇工最多时达１２０人。１９８５年以来，他多次指使人强行进入国营矿的坑道内采金，有时一次就盗采金矿石３０００多吨，含金属量多达３５公斤。刘玉荣不但搞采金，还在自己院内搞了个地下氰化炼金室。凭靠这些，如今他已成为腰缠万贯，拥有汽车多辆的阔佬。另一暴富者是曾任当地党支部书记的王富。他多次把矿与国营矿的坑道打通，盗采国营矿的金矿石。如今，他成为暴发户后，在国营矿的大门口，盖起了富丽堂皇的住宅。
    在峪耳崖，还有一个远近闻名、富甲一方号称“杨百万”的人物。目前，他家中仅进口汽车就有９辆，其中有豪华“皇冠”、“奔驰２８０”、“丰田”等高级轿车。此人由倒卖黄金起家，发展为倒卖钢材、承包公司。一次，杨百万的儿子，带着步话机、坐着小轿车到承德县一带倒卖金戒指，被拿获时，从他身上搜出金戒指４０多枚，总重约２００克。
    这里的个体采金给国家黄金资源带来巨大损失。据有关部门不完全统计，自１９８３年以来，由于滥采乱挖，当地国营矿山已损失矿量４５０００多吨。金属量近６００公斤，损失量可供一个小型国营矿开采３年。同期，国营矿被破坏生产设施和物资的直接价值也已达十几万元。
    这一带走私贩金活动也十分猖獗。据地区黄金公司统计，１９８６年到１９８８年，这里个体采金者交售给国家的黄金由２０００多两降到３００余两。１９８８年上半年以前，这里个体采金者采的黄金，大部分通过走私流向南部沿海地区。用当地人的说法是：“一两交共产党，九两给香港”。１９８８年下半年以来，随着国内黄金黑市价格的变化，这里的个体采金把头也改变策略，不再倒卖成品金，改为储存黄金或将金加工首饰后出售，有的则干脆以做地基砌墙等方式将品位高的金矿石储备起来。
    对于非法的个体采金、炼金活动，当地政府也曾采取了一些措施，试图禁止，但都收效甚微。主要是抓得不狠，抓得不力。对于破坏国家财产的行为没有严格加以制止，少数干部甚至明里暗里支持这种行为，带头采金和炼金。
