The theoretical research liaison group for the primary stage of socialism held a symposium on contemporary socialist issues in Beijing on May 9 and 10.

Comrades Zhao Ziyang, Hu Qili, and Rui Xianwen met with the participants of the symposium in the afternoon of May 9.

The symposium exchanged views on the research situation of the primary stage of socialism over the past year and, in connection with the world situation, the trends of the times, and the domestic and international theoretical trends, discussed how to further advance this research.

The participants felt that it is necessary to fully recognize the urgency of developing socialist theory. The Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee was the beginning and starting point of the great liberation of socialist theoretical thinking, and significant progress has been made in the past decade. The development of the domestic and international situation after the Thirteenth Congress requires us to take a new step. The socialist reform has opened up a new situation, but it has also encountered many difficulties and obstacles. Only by achieving new breakthroughs in theory, strategy, and ideology can we better follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and continue to push forward the reform and construction.

At the symposium, the participants deeply felt that in studying the issues of the primary stage of socialism in our country, we must first stand on the basis of China's national conditions, but also look at the world. Many comrades mentioned that we cannot separate the research on contemporary socialist countries and socialist movements from the research on contemporary capitalism and the development of the Third World, nor can we separate the re-recognition of the entire socialism and the re-recognition of the entire capitalism. Without these, many of our problems in the primary stage of socialism cannot be explained clearly. The world has undergone great changes, and it is not possible to ignore the world situation. The reason why contemporary capitalism can still show great vitality is that it has continuously carried out various reforms and adjustments. Socialism has also shown a powerful force that deeply impressed people, but later it developed slowly and stagnated, and it suffered greatly from the rigidity of thought and system. Socialism must open up a path to fully demonstrate its superiority through the development of theory and the reform of the system.

Some comrades proposed that socialist reform must pass through two "tests" - the "market test" and the "democracy test." The participants of the symposium thought this was a concise and vivid expression. Passing through these two "tests" means solving two themes: the theme of economic system reform and the theme of political system reform. Through reform, we must establish a new order of socialist commodity economy and a new order of socialist democratic politics. Following the proposal to establish a new order of socialist commodity economy last May, the Party Central Committee this May again proposed to establish a new order of socialist democratic politics, which is extremely important in both practice and theory. Many issues such as democracy, freedom, human rights, mass participation, power balance, and clean government under the socialist system should be brought to the forefront of theoretical research. In the new situation, the weakness of theoretical work is a big problem. Now there are so many problems that need to be studied and answered, and theoretical workers have a great role to play. Theoretical work should not just be commentary, but should be conducted with a thorough and independent scientific spirit, seeking truth from facts, and producing scientific research results to provide theoretical guidance and scientific basis for the Party and the state to make decisions and formulate policies.

At the symposium, the participants also exchanged views on research topics such as the economy, politics, and culture of the primary stage of socialism in our country, the classes, strata, interest groups, ethnic relations, and social development of the primary stage of socialism in our country, the value goals, historical development, and international environment of socialism, as well as the transformation and construction of the Communist Party under the conditions of being in power and socialist modernization.

Relevant responsible comrades from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the Central Party School, some central departments, and Shanghai, Sichuan, Guangdong, Heilongjiang, the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, and Guangming Daily participated in the symposium.

　　初级阶段理论研究座谈会提出    
    改革要过“市场关”“民主关”
    社会主义制度下的民主、自由、人权、群众参与、权力制衡和廉政建设等问题应提到理论研究重要位置上
    新华社北京５月１１日电　社会主义初级阶段理论研究联络小组５月９日、１０日在北京召开当代社会主义研究问题的座谈会。
    赵紫阳、胡启立、芮杏文同志５月９日下午会见了参加座谈会的同志。
    座谈会交流了去年以来社会主义初级阶段理论研究的情况，并且联系世界形势、时代潮流、国内外思想理论动向，对如何进一步开展这方面的研究进行了讨论。
    与会同志认为，必须充分认识发展社会主义理论的迫切性。党的十一届三中全会是我们社会主义理论思维大解放的发端和起步，十年来有了重大的进展，十三大以后国内国际形势的发展要求我们跨上一个新的台阶。社会主义改革打开了新的局面，同时遇到许多艰难和困扰。只有在理论上、战略上、观念上取得新的突破，才能更好地沿着有中国特色的社会主义道路，把改革和建设继续推向前进。
    在座谈会上，同志们深切地感到，研究我国社会主义初级阶段问题，首先要立足中国的国情，同时也要放眼世界。许多同志谈到，不能脱离对当代世界社会主义国家和社会主义运动的研究，不能脱离对当代资本主义和第三世界发展的研究，不能脱离对整个社会主义的再认识和对整个资本主义的再认识，脱离这些，我们社会主义初级阶段的许多问题就讲不清楚。世界已经发生了很大的变化，不认识世界大势是不行的。当代资本主义之所以还能显示很大的活力，一个根本原因就是它不断地进行了种种改革和调整。社会主义也曾经显示过给人深刻印象的巨大力量，后来发展缓慢和停滞，就是吃了思想僵化和体制僵化的大亏。社会主义必须从理论发展和体制改革中，开辟充分显示自己优越性的道路。
    有的同志提出，社会主义改革要过两个“关”——“市场关”和“民主关”。参加座谈的同志认为这是个简明生动的表达。过两个“关”，也就是要解决两个主题，经济体制改革的主题和政治体制改革的主题。通过改革，要建立社会主义商品经济新秩序和社会主义民主政治新秩序。继去年五月提出建立社会主义商品经济新秩序之后，党中央今年五月又提出建立社会主义民主政治新秩序，这在实践上和理论上都极其重要。社会主义制度下的民主、自由、人权、群众参与、权力制衡和廉政建设等许多问题，都应当提到理论研究的重要位置上来。在新的形势面前，理论工作薄弱是个大问题。现在有那么多问题需要研究和回答，理论工作者大有用武之地。理论工作不应只是作注释，而应当以彻底的和独立的科学精神，实事求是地进行研究，拿出科学的研究成果，为党和国家作出决策、制定政策提供理论指导和科学依据。
    座谈会上，同志们还就我国社会主义初级阶段的经济、政治和文化，我国社会主义初级阶段的阶级、阶层、利益集团、民族关系和社会发展，社会主义的价值目标、历史发展和国际环境，以及在执政和社会主义现代化建设条件下共产党的改造和建设等方面的研究选题，交换了意见。
    中国社会科学院、中央党校、中央一些部门和上海、四川、广东、黑龙江、新华社香港分社、人民日报社、光明日报社等地方和单位的有关负责同志参加了座谈会。
