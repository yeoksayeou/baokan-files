    The East German swimming star, Kristin Otto, who won six gold medals at the Olympics last year, now aspires to become a sports journalist.

    Otto recently told a Soviet reporter that as a child, like all girls, she dreamed of dolls and pretty dresses. Her ambition to win at the Olympics came later. Now, her goal is to master the profession of journalism as quickly and as well as possible.

    At the age of 23, Otto was awarded a gold crown weighing 600 grams, adorned with 24 pearls, by the International Olympic Committee for her outstanding achievements in swimming. However, she only wore the crown once during the award ceremony at the request of photographers. It was then displayed for a short time at the Leipzig Sports Museum before being stored in a safe at a local bank. Otto values her honors but does not let them become a burden. She believes that honors and fame rise and fall with athletic performance. Despite her Olympic achievements, she remains the same Kristin Otto as before the Olympics.

    For Otto, time is now her most precious commodity. There is so much to do, and time is so scarce. The daughter of a physics professor believes that journalism is also a science. She has only just begun to explore this field and will need to exert considerable effort to truly master it.

    Otto is very diligent in her studies but has not abandoned her swimming training. Even while interning at the Leipzig Broadcasting Station, she continued to train for three hours a day. She will continue to strive for new achievements.

　　奥托的理想
    本报记者  许宏治
    去年曾在奥运会上一人独得６枚金牌的民主德国游泳名将克里斯廷·奥托，现在的理想是当一名体育记者。
    奥托不久前在接受苏联记者采访时说，她小时候和所有的女孩子一样，向往的是布娃娃和漂亮的连衣裙，要在奥运会上夺取胜利的理想是后来才产生的。而现在，她的理想是尽快地、尽量好地掌握新闻这门专业。
    今年２３岁的奥托曾因在游泳方面的杰出成就而被国际奥委会授予一顶重６００克、上面镶嵌着２４颗珍珠的金冠。但是这顶金冠她只是在授给她的仪式上应摄影记者的要求戴过一次，后来在莱比锡体育博物馆陈列了一段时间，便存放到当地银行的保险柜里去了，奥托珍惜自己所获得的荣誉。但并没有把荣誉变成包袱。她认为，荣誉和名气随着运动成绩的好坏而起落。尽管她在奥运会上获得了殊荣，她仍是奥运会前的克里斯廷·奥托。
    现在，对奥托来说最宝贵的是时间。要做的事情太多，而时间太不够用。这位物理学教授的女儿认为，新闻也是一门科学，她只是刚刚涉足这门科学，要真正掌握它，还要付出很大的努力。
    奥托在学习方面非常勤奋，但同时并未放弃游泳训练。不久前，她在莱比锡广播电台实习时，仍坚持每天训练三小时。她要继续努力，争取创造新的成绩。
