Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th. People's Daily reporter Huang Caizhong reports: The Ministry of Agriculture today invited leaders and experts from the China Democratic League (CDL) Central Committee for a discussion on the development of China's agriculture.

In December of last year, the CDL Central Committee's Economic Committee had submitted a document titled "Opinions and Suggestions on Agricultural Issues," which drew significant attention from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. During today's discussion, leaders and experts from the CDL Central Committee spoke openly and frankly, sharing their views on macroeconomic adjustments, agricultural science and education, agricultural product pricing, land systems, and other issues.

State Councilor Chen Junsheng told the attendees that everyone had expressed their thoughts candidly, and the opinions were all very sincere and valuable.

Attendees included CDL Central Committee Chairman Fei Xiaotong, Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Minister of Forestry Gao Dezhan, and CDL members and experts such as Luo Hanshun, Wang Chuanfan, Hou Xueyu, Yang Hanxi, An Xiyu, Wu Daqin, and Hu Xijie.
