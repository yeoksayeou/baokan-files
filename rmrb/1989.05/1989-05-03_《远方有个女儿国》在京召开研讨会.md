	People's Literature Publishing House recently held a discussion meeting on the novel "A Daughterland Far Away." Chen Huangmei, Li Zhi, and more than ten others participated, and the author Bai Hua specially came from Shanghai to attend the meeting. At the meeting, everyone affirmed the work, which is highly political yet full of poetry, yearning, and ideals. The novel's use of the free life of the Mosuo people to contrast the absurdity of the "Cultural Revolution" that mutilated human nature was also deemed appropriate. However, there are still areas worth considering in deepening the theme. Bai Hua said that when he wrote this work, he only thought that everything during the "Cultural Revolution" was absurd, but he did not realize it was a "sacred absurdity," which affected the excavation of the theme.

　　《远方有个女儿国》在京召开研讨会
    本报讯  人民文学出版社最近举办了长篇小说《远方有个女儿国》讨论会，陈荒煤、黎之等十余人参加，作者白桦也特意从上海赶来赴会。会上，大家对这部有着很强政治性又充满诗意、憧憬、理想的作品作了肯定。对于小说用摩梭人的自由生活来对比“文革”中阉割人性的荒诞，大家也觉得可取。但小说在深化主题上还有值得思考的地方。白桦说，他写这部作品时，只想到“文革”的一切是荒诞的，但没想到是“神圣的荒诞”，从而影响了主题的开掘。
