President Bush, in his address to the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States at the beginning of this month, proposed improving the partnership between North and South American countries. He expressed that the U.S. government would strive to establish a new partnership. He also emphasized that this new partnership should be rooted in democratic politics to ensure the development of a market economy.

It appears that this is a policy adjustment made by the Bush administration after reflecting on the U.S. policy towards Latin America during the Reagan era, aimed at safeguarding America's long-term interests. Everyone knows that in the past, Reagan primarily relied on strength, pursuing a policy of "low-intensity conflict," while providing aid to rebuild its hegemony in the Western Hemisphere. The reasons for Bush's change are threefold:

First, with the easing of U.S.-Soviet relations and the cooling of global hotspots, the United States can pay more attention to matters in its "backyard." Second, since the 1980s, Latin America has made decisive progress in democratization and is striving to achieve regional peace and economic development. The trend towards independence has further developed. The heads of state of the eight Latin American countries have twice convened without the United States to discuss major issues in the region, demanding that the United States treat Latin American countries as "equal partners" and jointly handle regional affairs. The United States cannot but give this serious consideration. Third, over the past eight years, the Reagan administration's interference in Central American affairs and its "low-intensity conflict" strategy in the region have failed, drawing criticism from the U.S. Congress, political circles, and academics. In this situation, the U.S. government has had to adjust its policy towards Latin American countries. President Bush's proposal to establish a new partnership among American countries is a move that follows the trend and will undoubtedly receive attention from U.S. public opinion and Latin American countries.

There is a Latin American proverb: "Every coin has two sides." Bush's new partnership theory is undoubtedly a step forward compared to Reagan's approach. However, people have also seen from the Bush administration's diplomatic practice that some of its actions contradict this new partnership theory. Countries, regardless of size and wealth, should be equal as partners. The new partnership should abandon the old habit of treating other countries as "second-class citizens." Respecting the sovereignty and independence of other countries and not interfering in their internal affairs should be the minimum standard for a new partnership. However, the United States recently interfered in Panama's elections, even threatening military action, which shows that the United States has not treated the sovereign state of Panama as an "equal partner" in this hemisphere. For example, while the Bush administration announced its support for achieving peace in Central America, it also threatened Nicaragua that if it did not fulfill its promise of democratization, the United States would not rule out the option of providing military aid to the anti-government forces. This "carrot and stick" approach of threats and intimidation is unacceptable to any country with national dignity. In the eyes of the U.S. government, is Nicaragua not being treated as a "partner" that can be bullied at will? This is also far from the "new partnership."

One concrete action is worth more than a dozen declarations. If the Bush administration not only verbally but also in action genuinely treats Latin American countries as "equal partners," even if it is just a little bit of real action, it would help promote the fair and reasonable resolution of issues in the Latin American region.

### 美国的“新伙伴关系”说

　　美国的“新伙伴关系”说
    管彦忠
    布什总统在本月初举行的美洲国家组织常设理事会上提出了改善美洲北南国家之间伙伴工作关系的主张，表示美国政府将为建立新的伙伴关系而努力。他还强调这种新伙伴关系要扎根于民主政治，以保证市场经济的发展。
    看来，这是布什政府对里根时代美国的拉美政策进行反思之后，为维护美国的长远利益而作出的政策调整。谁都知道，过去里根主要是以实力为基础、推行“低烈度战争”的方针，同时加以援助以重建它在西半球的盟主地位。布什的改变，究其原因有三：
    一是在美苏关系缓和、世界热点地区降温之后，美国可以较多地关注“后院”的事情。二是８０年代以来拉丁美洲在民主化进程取得决定性的进展之后，正为实现地区和平和发展经济而努力，独立自主的倾向进一步发展。拉美８国集团首脑曾两度撇开美国聚会，共同商讨本地区的重大问题，要求美国以“平等伙伴”的态度对待拉美国家，共同处理地区事务。美国对此不能不加以三思。三是８年来里根政府干涉中美洲事务，在这一地区推行的“低烈度战争”战略已告失败，美国国会和政界以及学术界人士纷纷予以批评。在此情况下，美国政府不得不调整对拉美国家的政策。布什总统现在提出建立美洲国家新伙伴关系的主张，这是顺应潮流之举，无疑会受到美国舆论和拉美国家的重视。
    拉美人有句谚语：“钱币总有两面”。布什提出的新伙伴关系论，比里根主义那一套无疑是向前跨进了一步。但同时人们也从布什政府的外交实践中看到它的某些作为与上述新伙伴关系论相违背。国家不分大小和贫富，作为伙伴应当是平等的。新伙伴关系应抛弃把别国当成“二等公民”处置的旧习。尊重别国的主权和独立，不干涉他国事务应是新伙伴关系起码的准则。可是，美国最近对巴拿马大选横加干涉，甚至出兵进行威胁，这就表明美国并没有将主权国家巴拿马作为本半球“平等的伙伴”对待。又如，布什政府在宣布支持实现中美洲和平的同时，又威胁尼加拉瓜如不履行实现民主化诺言，美国将不排除再向尼反政府武装提供军事援助的选择，这种“胡萝卜加大棒”的威胁恐吓是任何一个有民族尊严的国家不能接受的。在美国政府眼里，尼加拉瓜岂不被当成可以随意欺凌的“伙伴”，这也与“新伙伴关系”相距甚远。
    一个实际行动比一打宣言更有效。布什政府如果不仅在口头上，而且在行动上切实将拉美国家作为“平等的伙伴”相处，哪怕是有那么一点实实在在的行动，它都将有助于促进拉美地区问题的公正合理解决。
