To enable grain, cotton, and oil, among other major agricultural products, to soon exit their stagnant phase and return to a path of stable production, we must first clarify the true reasons behind the shift from rapid development to decline and stagnation in the production of these major agricultural products since 1985. This will allow us to address the root causes and solve the problems. The following are some of my views on this matter.

Reasons for the Stagnation in Major Agricultural Product Production

The primary reasons are as follows:

(1) In 1984, when agriculture experienced a comprehensive bumper harvest, the state procurement system for grain, cotton, and oil was transformed into a contract procurement system, and the mandatory procurement of pigs was abolished. The direction of these reforms was correct. At the time, it was stipulated that within the contract, prices would be procured at a proportional rate, and outside the contract, prices would be freely traded in the market. When market prices were too low, a protective price would be used for procurement. If this contract system and protective price mechanism were properly implemented, they could promote the stable increase in production of grain, cotton, oil, and other major agricultural products. The problem first arose from an incorrect assessment of the production situation of major agricultural products at that time. Although grain, cotton, oil, and other major agricultural products achieved unprecedented bumper harvests in 1984, due to China's large population, the per capita grain supply was only about 800 jin (approximately 400 kg), which was still at a relatively low supply level and not abundant. The same was true for cotton and oil. It was merely due to insufficient storage, transportation, processing, and circulation issues that many regions experienced difficulties in selling their products. At the time, this "selling difficulty" was not scientifically analyzed, and it was mistakenly believed that grain, cotton, oil, and other major agricultural products were absolutely surplus. It seemed that China was no longer concerned about insufficient agricultural products but rather about surplus agricultural products; the focus was not on how to sustainably and stably increase production but on how to convert or even limit production.

(2) Due to the overly optimistic assessment mentioned above, the actual procurement prices for grain, cotton, oil, and other products were set too low. For example, the grain procurement system implemented a 3:7 proportional pricing, causing farmers in new commercial grain-producing areas to suffer losses. At the same time, many places reduced the grades and prices during procurement, abolished the "three-link" policy for agricultural production materials, and neglected other effective policies and measures that rewarded grain, cotton, and oil production. This caused the comparative benefits of farmers engaging in grain, cotton, and oil production to decline.

(3) The operational mechanisms of the management departments were not adapted. When grain became difficult to sell and farmers rushed to sell their grain, the management departments, fearing increased losses from procurement, and the financial departments, fearing increased subsidies, not only did not procure at the protective price but instead took the opportunity to sell off over 40 billion jin of grain. This further drove down the already low market price of grain, making it even more difficult to sell grain in the market. This further exacerbated the decline in the comparative benefits of grain.

(4) Since 1985, inflation has continued and worsened, posing a threat to the development of the rural commodity economy, particularly the production of grain, cotton, oil, and other major agricultural products. This is evident in the sharp rise in the prices of agricultural production materials, which far exceeded the increase in the prices of grain, cotton, oil, and other major agricultural products. Coupled with hoarding and speculative reselling, it was difficult for farmers to obtain production materials at fair prices. For example, in the Yiyang region of Hunan Province, a survey of grain production costs showed that in 1980, 50 jin of rice could be exchanged for 26 jin of steel, 225 jin of cement, and 40 jin of diesel. By 1985, this had decreased to 16.3 jin, 136 jin, and 20.4 jin, respectively, approximately 40-50% less. In 1987, the production cost per mu of rice was 42.6% higher than in 1985. This caused the "scissors gap" between industrial and agricultural product prices, which had been narrowed through reasonable price adjustments before 1984, to widen again, leading to a more severe decline in the comparative benefits of farmers engaged in grain, cotton, and oil production.

(5) The imbalance between industrial and agricultural sectors has resurfaced. Since 1984, the scale of construction investment has expanded rapidly, and processing industries have grown at an excessively high speed. In 1988, the growth rate of industry to agriculture was 6.7:1, far exceeding the normal ratio of 3:1, making it difficult for agriculture to bear the burden. Especially the proportion of investment in agricultural infrastructure and agricultural industries has sharply decreased. The proportion of national investment in agricultural industries dropped from 4.2% during 1952-1980 to 1.3% during the Sixth Five-Year Plan, affecting the growth of agricultural production materials. The supply of agricultural production materials has become increasingly tight, and various speculative activities have flourished, leading to frequent incidents of farmers rushing to buy fertilizers, plastic sheets, and other materials. This further dampened the enthusiasm of farmers.

The above points are generally applicable to most regions of the country. However, there were a few regions that had a relatively correct understanding and grasp of the agricultural situation at that time and did not relax their focus on the production of major agricultural products. For example, Beijing Municipality continued to implement the original policies and measures to reward grain production from 1985 onwards, did not reduce agricultural investment, and strengthened scientific and technological measures. As a result, grain production, except for a slight decrease in 1986, maintained a steady growth trend in 1985, 1987, and 1988. In terms of pig production, Zoucheng County in Shandong Province and a few other provinces and regions, such as Sichuan Province, took effective measures to ensure smooth circulation and socialized services, making it easy to sell pigs when there were many, protecting pig farmers with protective prices, and ensuring the supply of feed. Therefore, since 1985, they have maintained a basic balance in pig production and sales, with production steadily increasing and a virtuous cycle emerging.

Discussion of Several Views

Over the past few years, the decline and stagnation of major agricultural product production have raised serious concerns and sparked much discussion. Among the various views, the following are worth discussing.

The first view is the "cyclical fluctuation" theory. Some people believe that since the founding of the People's Republic, grain production has experienced seven cyclical fluctuations, with cycles ranging from 2 to 7 years, averaging 4-6 years. Therefore, they consider the decline and stagnation of grain production from the continuous bumper harvests of 1984 to the decline and stagnation since 1985 as just another historical cyclical fluctuation.

It is correct to point out that grain production has experienced cyclical fluctuations since the founding of the People's Republic. However, discussing cyclical fluctuations in such a general way not only fails to explain why this fluctuation occurred between 1984 and 1985 rather than at other times and its specific causes but also obscures the specific analysis of the different causes of each fluctuation. In fact, the seven reductions in grain production since the founding of the People's Republic can be divided into two categories: one is mainly due to natural disasters, which is the majority of cases; the other is mainly due to policy mistakes. These two types of causes have different characteristics. For reductions mainly caused by natural disasters: first, the magnitude is generally small, mostly less than 5%; second, the recovery period is usually short, ranging from one to two years; third, natural disasters are cyclical, making the reductions caused by them also cyclical. However, for reductions mainly caused by policy mistakes, first, the magnitude of the reduction is large, such as a 15% reduction in 1959 and an 18% reduction in 1960; second, policy mistakes often lead to the destruction of productive forces, making the recovery period long, such as the 6 years it took to recover from the policy mistakes of 1958; third, they are not cyclical.

Based on these characteristics, the reduction in grain production in 1985 has the characteristics of policy execution deviations: the reduction magnitude is relatively large (7%); the recovery period is also long, and it has not yet recovered to the highest level of 1984 after 4 years.

The second view is the "inevitable stagnation" theory. It is believed that the decline and stagnation of grain production since 1985 indicate that the policy effects of rural reforms have reached their limit, and technical effects must replace policy effects. However, due to the constraints of the technological progress cycle and the country's financial difficulties, agricultural stagnation and fluctuation over a relatively long period are inevitable. In fact, the decline and stagnation of grain, cotton, oil, and other major agricultural products since 1985 are not evidence that the correct policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee for the development of agriculture have lost their effectiveness. Instead, they are the result of deviations in the assessment of the situation and the implementation of policies. Moreover, even during the 4 years when most regions of the country experienced a decline and stagnation in major agricultural products, a few regions, due to a relatively correct understanding of the situation and the implementation of policies, maintained a steady increase in the production of major agricultural products without experiencing a decline and stagnation. Furthermore, since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, due to the emphasis on grain, cotton, and oil production by various regions, the increase in procurement prices, the gradual opening of the grain market after the completion of the procurement tasks, and the rise in grain market prices, the comparative income of grain farmers has improved. Therefore, the national grain sowing area has expanded by nearly 20 million mu, and the oilseed planting area has also expanded, showing a positive turnaround. These comparisons prove that the policy effects of the development of agriculture formulated after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee have not become obsolete but are still very effective. If they are seriously implemented, the production of major agricultural products can exit the stagnant phase and achieve stable increases.

Regarding scientific and technological aspects, it is correct to say that technological progress has a certain cyclical nature. However, the cycle is mainly in the research and experimental processes. As for the promotion of many mature technologies in agriculture, the effects are relatively quick. Currently, the conversion rate of agricultural scientific and technological achievements in China is only 30-40%. If this is increased to 50-60%, the benefits will be significant. Hybrid rice increases yield by an average of 75 jin per mu compared to conventional rice, and hybrid corn increases yield by an average of 50 jin per mu. Plastic film mulching increases yield by an average of 100 jin per mu. The current multiple cropping index is only 149%, and if it is increased by one percentage point, it is equivalent to increasing the planting area by 15 million mu. The potential in scientific and technological aspects is enormous and has great room for development. Therefore, whether from the perspective of policy effects or technological effects, the claim that "China's agriculture will inevitably stagnate and fluctuate over a relatively long period" does not reflect the reality.

The third view is the "resource shortage" theory. It is believed that the key is not to explain the current agricultural situation but to recognize the fact of agricultural resource shortages. The agricultural situations in 1984 and 1987 were merely reflections of the cyclical fluctuation characteristics of agricultural resource shortages, and recognizing and solving the shortage problem should be our focus.

It is a fact that China's per capita arable land and resources are below the world average. However, this long-term factor of resource shortages cannot explain why, under the same conditions of resource shortages, major agricultural products were able to achieve continuous bumper harvests from 1979 to 1984, while experiencing a decline and stagnation in the four years since 1985.

It should be noted that China's per capita arable land and resources being below the world average does not mean that China's agricultural production has no potential. China still has many undeveloped resources. As long as the policies are correct and farmers' stable and sustained enthusiasm is mobilized, there is great potential in resource development. In terms of breadth, there are still large tracts of arable wasteland across the country, approximately 500 million mu, of which about 200 million mu can be reclaimed into farmland. There are approximately 40 million mu of unused seawater and freshwater aquaculture areas, 1.1 billion mu of barren hills and slopes suitable for afforestation, and over 600 million mu of grasslands suitable for grazing. In terms of depth, 65% of the total arable land in the country is low-yielding farmland, with great potential for increase. For example, in the five counties of the Ebei hilly region, through the implementation of agricultural infrastructure construction and the improvement of production conditions in recent years, the grain yield per mu has increased from 50 jin to over 300 jin, becoming one of the high-yield grain-producing regions in the country.

The fourth view is the "transition from extraordinary growth to regular growth" theory. It is believed that 1981-1984 was one of the three periods of extraordinary growth since the founding of the People's Republic, which was the result of a profound change in rural production relations and had a clear compensatory nature. The end of this extraordinary growth is inevitable, and the current situation is a transition to regular growth.

I believe that it is reasonable to say that the continuous bumper harvests of major agricultural products before 1984 had a certain recovery or compensatory factor. However, first, this theory cannot explain why this fluctuation occurred precisely in 1985 rather than in other years. Second, this theory attributes the abnormal reduction in major agricultural product production in 1985, caused by deviations in the assessment of the situation and policy implementation, to normal necessity. Third, in the four years since 1985, grain production has decreased in two years, 1985 and 1988, with a total reduction of over 38 million tons, and increased in two years, 1986 and 1987, with a total increase of 25 million tons, but it has not recovered to the highest level of 1984. Cotton production has decreased in all four years, and oil production has decreased in three years, both significantly lower than the highest levels of 1984 or 1985. Therefore, these four years cannot be called "regular growth" but are a stagnant phase.

The fifth view is the "state ownership or private ownership of land" theory. It is believed that the stagnation of grain production since 1985 indicates that the effectiveness of the household contract responsibility system has diminished, and in the future, to adapt to the need for expanding the scale of operations or to further mobilize farmers' enthusiasm for grain production, the current land ownership system must be reformed. Some advocate for state ownership of land, while others advocate for private ownership of land. The problem is that using the ineffectiveness of the household contract responsibility system to explain the stagnation of grain production since 1985, as mentioned above, does not conform to the facts. Furthermore, implementing state ownership or private ownership of land will not achieve the goal of further mobilizing the enthusiasm of grain farmers and expanding the scale of operations. As some comrades have pointed out, state ownership of land artificially elevates the ownership system, which will dampen farmers' enthusiasm and plunge rural areas into economic difficulties. Private ownership of land will cause the state and collectives to lose control over land, and farmers' reluctance to sell land will hinder the rational use of land and be unfavorable for the expansion of the scale of land operations; it will weaken the investment capacity for agricultural production. Someone has calculated that the value of China's arable land is approximately 20,000 billion yuan. If the scale of operations is doubled, it would require more than 10,000 billion yuan, which agricultural producers cannot actually afford. Even if they could afford it, agricultural reproduction would face great difficulties in obtaining other necessary investments; it will lead to land speculation, and a large amount of agricultural land will be converted to other uses, causing increasing difficulties for agricultural production.

In summary, as long as we face the true reasons for the fluctuations and stagnation in the production of major agricultural products, firmly adhere to the Party Central Committee's policy of relying on policy, science, and investment for agriculture, promptly carry out institutional reforms, structural adjustments, and improve other policies and technological measures, comprehensively improve the level of agricultural modernization, establish a normal market order, improve the market price mechanism, curb inflation, and establish a sound macro-control mechanism, we can gradually improve the comparative benefits of farmers engaged in agricultural production, especially the production of major agricultural products, and stabilize farmers' enthusiasm. In this way, China's agriculture, especially the production of major agricultural products, can achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development. We should neither be blindly optimistic nor pessimistic about this.

　　如何看待主要农产品生产的徘徊
    詹武
    为了使粮、棉、油等主要农产品早日结束徘徊局面，重新走上稳定增产的道路，我们首先需要弄清１９８５年以来主要农产品生产从高速度发展转向下降和徘徊的真正原因，以便对症下药，解决问题。以下是我对这个问题的一些看法。
    主要农产品生产出现徘徊的原因
    其主要原因有五：
    （１）在１９８４年农业连续全面大丰收的好形势下，将粮食、棉花、油料统购改为合同定购，取消生猪派购，改革的方向是正确的。当时规定合同内按比例价收购，合同外按市价自由销售，市价过低时按保护价收购。这种合同制与保护价机制如果运用得好，是可以促进粮、棉、油等主要农产品稳定增产的。问题首先出在对当时主要农产品生产形势估计的失当上。虽然１９８４年粮、棉、油等主要农产品获得空前大丰收，但由于中国人口众多，人均占有粮食只不过８００斤，还是一个比较低的供给水平，并不宽裕。棉花、油料等也是如此。只是由于仓储不足，交通运输和加工环节跟不上，以及流通不畅等原因，导致许多地区出现“卖难”现象。当时，对这种“卖难”现象并未进行科学的分析，而错误地认为粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品已经绝对过剩，似乎中国不再是愁农产品不足，而是愁农产品过剩；不是着力于如何持续地稳定地增产，而是设法转化甚至限产。
    （２）由于上述对形势过份乐观的估计，导致对粮、棉、油等实际收购价格掌握偏低。例如粮食收购实行倒三七比例价，使新商品粮地区粮农吃了亏。与此同时，不少地方在收购时压级压价，取消农用生产资料“三挂钩”政策，其他一些各地规定行之有效的奖励粮、棉、油生产的政策措施，也大都废弛了。这样就使农民从事粮、棉、油生产的比较利益下降。
    （３）经营部门的经营体制不适应。当粮食出现“卖难”，粮农纷纷抛售粮食时，经营部门怕多收购增加亏损，财政部门怕增加补贴，不仅不按保护价收购，反而乘机抛售４００多亿斤，使已经降低的粮食市场价格更加下跌，使市场上卖粮更加困难。这又使粮食的比较利益下降更加严重。
    （４）从１９８５年以来，通货膨胀持续发展，而且愈演愈烈，对农村商品经济尤其粮、棉、油等主要农产品生产的发展构成威胁。突出表现在农用生产资料价格猛涨，其涨价幅度大大超出粮、棉、油等主要农产品。加上囤积居奇、转手倒卖盛行，使农民很难得到平价生产资料供应。例如对湖南省益阳地区粮食生产成本调查：１９８０年５０公斤稻谷可分别换回钢材２６公斤、水泥２２５公斤、柴油４０公斤，到１９８５年只能分别换回１６．３公斤、１３６公斤、２０．４公斤，大约少换４０—５０％；而１９８７年每亩稻谷生产费用又比１９８５年上升４２．６％。这就使得在１９８４年以前由于合理调整价格结构而缩小了的工农业产品价格“剪刀差”又重新扩大，使从事粮、棉、油生产的农民比较利益更加严重下降。
    （５）工农业比例关系重新趋于失调。１９８４年以来，基建投资规模加剧膨胀，加工工业超高速增长。１９８８年工业与农业的增长速度之比，为６．７比１，大大超过了３比１的正常比例，使农业难以承受。特别是对农业基本建设和农用工业的投资比重急剧下降，全国对农用工业投资的比重由１９５２—１９８０年占４．２％下降为“六五”期间的１．３％，影响了农业生产资料的增长。农用生产资料供应日趋紧张，各种“倒爷”投机之风盛行，农民哄抢化肥、农膜等事件也屡屡发生，这也进一步挫伤了农民的积极性。
    以上是就全国大部分地区而言的。但也有少数地区当时对农业形势有比较正确的认识和掌握，没有放松过对主要农产品生产的重视。例如，北京市１９８５年以来对原有奖励粮食生产的政策措施照常执行，对农业的投入不减，并加强了科技措施，粮食生产除１９８６年微减外，１９８５、１９８７、１９８８各年均保持稳步增长的好势头。生猪生产，山东省诸城等县和四川省等少数省区采取了有效的流通和社会化服务措施，使渠道畅通，猪多时卖猪不难，养猪农民得到了保护价的保护，在饲料供应上也有保证。因此，他们从１９８５年以来生猪产销基本平衡，生产稳步上升，出现了良性循环的“小气候”。
  同几种看法的商讨
    几年来主要农产品生产出现下降和徘徊，引起人们严重关切，议论很多。其中，有几种看法值得商讨。
    第一种叫“周期波动”论。有的认为建国以来，粮食生产发生了七次周期性波动，周期长则７年，短则２年，平均４—６年。因而认为粮食生产１９８４年以前连续６年丰收到１９８５年以来４年下降徘徊，不过是历史上惯例的周期波动罢了。
    指出建国以来粮食有周期波动，这是对的。但这样笼统地谈论周期波动，不仅没有说明这一次为什么在１９８４年和１９８５年间而不是别的时间发生波动及其具体原因，而且会掩盖对导致历次波动的不同原因的具体分析。其实，建国以来粮食的七次减产，可区分为两种情况：一是主要由于自然灾害造成的，这是多数年份；二是主要由于政策失误造成的。这两种原因造成的减产具有不同的特点。就主要由自然灾害造成的减产说：一是幅度不大，多数在５％以下；二是恢复期，一般短一至二年；三是由于自然灾害带有周期性，从而使由此造成的减产也带有周期性。而就主要由于政策失误造成的减产分析，则第一减产的幅度大，如１９５９年减产１５％，１９６０年减产１８％；第二政策失误常常带来生产力的破坏，因而恢复期长，１９５８年的政策失误，用了６年时间才恢复起来；第三，不带周期性。
    根据这些特点判断，１９８５年的粮食减产带有政策执行偏差的特征：减产幅度较大（７％）；恢复期也长，时过４年仍未恢复到１９８４年的最高水平。
    第二种叫“停滞难免”论。认为１９８５年以来粮食生产出现下降和徘徊，说明农村改革的政策效应已成强弩之末，必须由技术效应来替换政策效应，而由于技术进步周期规律的限制和国家财力困难的限制，农业在较长时期内停滞徘徊已不可避免。其实，１９８５年以来粮食、棉花、油料等主要农产品生产出现下降徘徊，不是说明十一届三中全会为发展农业制定的一系列正确政策没有效应了，而是由于对形势的估计和对政策的贯彻发生了偏差所致。而且就在１９８５年以来这４年全国大多数地区主要农产品处于下降和徘徊时，少数地区由于比较正确地认识形势和贯彻政策，主要农产品生产一直稳步上升，没有出现下降和徘徊。同时，从十三届三中全会以来，由于各地重视抓粮、棉、油生产，调高了收购价格，随着定购任务完成陆续开放了粮食市场，加上粮食市价的提高，使粮农的比较收益有所提高，因此，全国粮食播种面积扩大近２０００万亩，油料种植面积也有所扩大，开始出现了一点好的转机。这些对比证明了十一届三中全会后制定的发展农业的政策效应，不仅没有成为强弩之末，而且是很有生命力的，如果认真贯彻执行，主要农产品生产就可能走出徘徊转为稳定增产。
    再以科学技术而论，说技术进步存在一定周期性，这是对的。但周期主要长在研究和试验的过程上。至于农业上许多成熟技术的推广，见效还是比较快的。目前我国农业科学技术成果转化率只有３０—４０％，如果把它提高到５０—６０％，其效益将很可观。杂交水稻比常规水稻平均每亩增产７５公斤，杂交玉米比常规玉米平均每亩增产５０公斤，地膜覆盖平均每亩增产１００公斤。复种指数现在只有１４９％，如提高一个百分点，就等于增加１５００万亩种植面积。科学技术方面的潜力很大，是大有作为的。可见不论从政策效应或技术效应看，所谓“我国农业在较长时期内停滞徘徊不可避免”之说，并不符合实际。
    第三种叫“资源短缺”论。认为问题的实质不在于如何解释当前的农业形势，而在于确认农业资源短缺这一事实。１９８４年和１９８７年的农业形势不过是农业资源短缺曲线的周期波动特征的反映，而如何认识和解决短缺问题才是我们的着力点。
    我国人均耕地和资源低于世界平均水平，这是事实。但这种资源短缺的情况是早已存在的长期因素，不能说明在同样的资源短缺的条件下，为什么从１９７９年到１９８４年主要农产品能连续丰收，而１９８５年以来的四年中却出现下降和徘徊。
    应该看到，我国人均耕地和资源低于世界平均水平，并不说明我国农业生产无所作为。我国未开发的资源还很多，只要政策对头，调动起农民稳定持久的积极性，在开发资源上也是大有作为的。就其广度而言，全国还有成片宜农荒地约５亿亩，可垦成农田约２亿亩。未曾利用的海水、淡水养殖面积约有４０００万亩，宜林荒山荒坡约１１亿亩，宜牧草山草坡６亿多亩。就其深度而言，全国现有中低产田占耕地总面积的６５％，增产潜力很大。例如鄂北丘岗地区五个县，近些年来通过开展农田基本建设，改善生产条件，粮食亩产由５０公斤提高到３００公斤以上，成了全国粮食高产地区之一。
    第四种叫“超常规增长转入常规增长”论。认为１９８１—１９８４年是建国以来三个超常规增长阶段之一，它是农村生产关系深刻变革的结果，带有明显的补偿性。这种超常规增长的结束是必然的，目前已进入常规增长阶段。
    我认为，说１９８４年以前主要农产品连续丰收带有一定的恢复或补偿的因素，是有道理的。但第一，此论不能说明为什么恰恰在１９８５年而不是别的年份发生这个波动。第二，此论将１９８５年主要农产品生产由于对形势估计和政策执行的偏差造成的非正常减产，说成了正常的必然性。第三，１９８５年以来四年中，粮食有两年减产，即１９８５年、１９８８年共减产３８００余万吨，两年回升，即１９８６年、１９８７年共回升２５００万吨，没有恢复到１９８４年最高水平。棉花四年都减产，油料三年减产，都明显低于１９８４年或１９８５年的最高水平。因此，这四年显然不能称作“常规增长”，而是徘徊局面。
    第五种叫“土地国有或私有”论。认为１９８５年以来粮食徘徊，说明了家庭承包经营责任制的效应已经不大灵了，今后要适应扩大经营规模的需要，或进一步调动农民种粮积极性，必须对现有土地所有制进行改革。有的主张要朝着土地国有改革，有的则主张向着土地私有改革。问题首先在于，用家庭承包责任制失灵来说明１９８５年以来粮食生产徘徊，如上所述并不符合事实。再则，实行土地国有或私有，也达不到进一步调动粮农积极性和扩大经营规模的目的。正如有的同志所阐述的那样，土地国有，将所有制人为地拔高，会挫伤农民积极性，使农村陷入经济困境。土地私有，一是会使国家和集体丧失土地支配权，而农民惜售土地，将会妨害土地的合理利用，不利于土地经营规模的扩大；二是会削弱对农业生产的投资能力。有人计算，我国耕地资产约２万多亿元，如果经营规模扩大一倍就需１万多亿元，由农业生产者支付如此巨款，实际办不到，即使办到，农业再生产所需的其他投资也会遇到极大困难；三是会产生土地投机，农业用地将大批转作他用，对农业生产造成越来越大的困难。
    总之，只要我们正视造成主要农产品生产波动和徘徊的真正原因，坚决遵循党中央提出的农业一靠政策，二靠科学，三靠投入的方针，抓紧体制改革、结构调整和完善其他政策上、科技上的措施，全面提高农业现代化水平，同时确立正常的市场秩序，健全市场价格机制，根治通货膨胀，建立起良好的宏观调控机制，逐步提高农民从事农业生产特别是主要农产品生产的比较利益，稳定农民的积极性，那么，我国农业特别是主要农产品生产就完全可能持续稳定协调地发展。对此，我们既不应盲目乐观，更用不着悲观。
