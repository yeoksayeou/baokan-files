A delegation of Tibetan officials returned to Tibet today after a visit to the interior of the country.

The delegation, consisting of 59 Tibetan officials, spent more than a month touring and studying in various parts of the country.

The delegation leader, Budoji, and deputy leader, Yù?, spoke about their experiences and gains from the visit. They said that it is because of the great motherland that there is a new, happy Tibet. The deep concern of the Party Central Committee and the strong support of all ethnic groups in the country are the great forces behind the construction of new Tibet.

Base-level officials from Lhasa, Shigatse, Chamdo, Shannan, and Ngari regions visited Shanghai, Tianjin, and economically developed coastal regions and industrial cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. They were greatly inspired by what they saw.

Bai'erden, a Tibetan county magistrate from Gongjue County in Chamdo Region, said that by comparing, one knows the difference. Tibet lags behind the coastal regions by several decades, and we must catch up with the advanced by making great efforts. Dawa Cairen, a Tibetan county committee secretary from Dingri County in Shigatse Region, said that Dingri County is located at the foot of Mount Qomolangma, a beautiful and mysterious place, but it was poor in the past due to its closed-off and isolated conditions. Reform and opening up have brought changes, and more and more foreign tourists are coming to visit Mount Qomolangma.

　　内地之行开了眼界    
    西藏干部参观团返藏
    据新华社北京５月７日电  （记者格来）西藏干部参观团今日离京返藏。
    由５９名藏族干部组成的这个参观团在祖国内地共参观学习了一个多月。
    参观团长布多吉、副团长尤?在谈到参观学习的收获时说，有了伟大的祖国，才有幸福的新西藏。党中央的深切关怀，全国各族人民的大力支援，是建设新西藏的巨大力量。
    拉萨、日喀则、昌都、山南、阿里等地区的基层干部在上海、天津和江苏、浙江等沿海经济发达地区和工业城市参观，大开眼界。
    昌都地区贡觉县藏族县长巴尔顿说，有对比方知道差距，西藏同沿海相差几十年，只有急起直追才能赶上先进。日喀则地区定日县藏族县委书记达瓦才仁说，定日县在珠穆朗玛峰下，是一个美丽、神奇的地方，但过去闭关封锁，很贫穷。改革开放，带来了变化，到珠峰下旅游的外国游客越来越多。
