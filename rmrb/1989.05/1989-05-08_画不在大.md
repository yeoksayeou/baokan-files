The trend of painting large-scale works is becoming increasingly prevalent. There are paintings of the Great Wall stretching for thousands of miles, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, paintings of poets and writers from ancient times to the present, and cityscapes. Some of these paintings are hundreds of meters long. The media often reports on these largest, longest, and most detailed paintings with praise, as if these massive, lengthy, and meticulously detailed works are the most outstanding creations. To be honest, the creators of these paintings often spend years of hard work and dedication, with the sincere intention of contributing to the art world. Some of these artists are indeed skilled in technique and craftsmanship. However, the artistic effect of these works is rather mediocre. After viewing these large-scale works, people are left with little impression besides their sheer size. The reason is simple: art is not measured by size or detail. What makes an artwork moving is primarily the artist's unique discoveries and creations, keen and meticulous observation, and a distinctive style of expression. The role of an artwork is mainly to cultivate and develop the viewer's sensory abilities. What often moves an artist is the details and nuances of an object. Vividly portraying these details and nuances can help the viewer understand and grasp the whole object. The Great Wall stretches for thousands of miles, but it is better to capture a corner or a segment, revealing a unique perspective of the Great Wall. There are countless poets throughout history, but it is better to focus on a few poets you truly love and understand, bringing their vivid and lifelike images to life. The principle of "one for ten, few for many" reflects the rules of artistic creation and appreciation, which are worth pondering.

In the 18th century, the famous German aesthete Johann Joachim Winckelmann wrote an article titled "Hints on the Observation of the Works of Art of the Ancients." He began by advising readers and critics: "If you want to evaluate an artwork, you should not pay attention to the patience and labor that went into its creation from the beginning, but rather to the creation through reason. Because, lack of talent can also be shown in love for labor, and talent can even be shown in the absence of love for labor. In this regard, the works completed by painters and sculptors with great patience and care can be compared to books that are meticulously compiled. Because just as the greatest art is not contained in scholarly writing, similarly, a painting completed with meticulousness and stability does not indicate that the author is a great artist. Depicting every detail on a canvas is like using verbose quotations in a work, some of which are even from books that have never been read."

May our artists gain some enlightenment from the words of this aesthete who lived more than 200 years ago. May we see more artworks that not only pour in the creator's heart and soul but also showcase their unique spirit and talent!

　　画不在大
    邵大箴
    画大画的趋势愈演愈烈。画万里长城，千里长江、黄河的，画自古至今诗人、作家的，画城市全貌的……长百米，数百米。新闻媒介常以赞美的口吻加以宣传报道，似乎这些最大、最长、最高、画得最细的画卷，就是最出色的创造。说实在的，这些画的作者常常用几年的心血，勤勤恳恳地作画，原意是想在艺术上有所贡献，其中有的作者在技术、技巧上也不乏功力。但是，这些作品的艺术效果却很平平。人们在观看了这些大作品之后，除了感到它们特别的“大”之外，几乎留不下别的印象。原因很简单，艺术不是以大、以细取胜。艺术品之所以能感人，主要靠艺术家独特的发现和创造，靠敏锐、细致的观察力和富有个性特色的表现力。艺术品的作用，也主要是培养和发展观赏者的感觉能力。客观事物使艺术家感动的，往往是局部和细节，生动地表现出这些局部和细节，能够使读者举一反三，发挥想象，从而对事物的整体有所理解和把握。长城万里，你画得面面俱到，不如取其一角一隅，画出不同于别人眼中的长城面貌来。古今诗人无数，你用同样的笔墨平等地对待，不如用力刻画真正喜爱和理解的几位诗人有血有肉的形象来。以一当十、以少胜多的道理，反映了艺术创造和欣赏的规律，值得我们好好体会。
    １８世纪德国著名美学家温克尔曼写过一篇题为《关于如何观照古代艺术的提示》的文章。他开宗明义地告诫读者和评论家：“如果你想评价艺术品，应该从开始起就不要去注意那创造的耐心和劳作，而要去注意用理智所进行的创造。因为，才能贫乏也可以表现于热爱劳动，而才能甚至可以在缺乏热爱劳动的地方表现出来。在这方面，画家们和雕塑家们用极大的耐心和细心完成的作品，可以和十分精细地编纂的书籍相比拟。因为正如最伟大的艺术不包含于学究气的写作，同样，精细和平稳地完成的画，也不表明作者是伟大的艺术家。在画面上描绘出一切细节，就像在一部著作中采用繁琐的引文，有的甚至是从没有读过的书本中引来的。”
    愿我们的艺术家从生活在２００多年前的这位美学家的话中得到一点启示。愿我们能看到更多的既倾注了创作者的心血，又表现出他们独创精神和才能的艺术作品！
