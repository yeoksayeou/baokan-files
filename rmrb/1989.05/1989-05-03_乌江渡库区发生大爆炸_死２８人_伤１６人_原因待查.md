A Major Explosion Occurs in the Wujiangdu Reservoir Area
	28 Dead, 16 Injured, Cause Under Investigation

According to Xinhua News Agency in Guiyang on May 3rd, (reporter He Tianwen) a major explosion occurred while handling a dangerous cliff in the Wujiangdu Hydropower Station reservoir area. The accident resulted in 28 deaths and 16 injuries.

This accident occurred on April 26th during the blasting of a dangerous cliff near the Wujiangdu Hydropower Station. The large yellow cliff standing about 400 meters from the left side of the Wujiangdu Hydropower Station dam in the reservoir area has poor geological conditions, with developed rock fissures and severe weathering and fragmentation. This seriously threatens the safety of the hydropower station with an installed capacity of over 600,000 kilowatts. With the approval of relevant authorities, the Middle South Survey and Design Institute designed the excavation of a 2,000-meter-long guide tunnel into the unstable rock mass of the large yellow cliff for chamber blasting to eliminate the hazard. On March 4th, the construction personnel successfully carried out the first chamber blasting. Soon after, the second blasting was also successful. According to the design, on April 26th, the final blasting was to be conducted in the guide tunnel with a total of 36 explosive chambers. At 11:22 AM, an explosion suddenly occurred while the construction personnel were loading explosives into the 27th explosive chamber. The cause of the sudden explosion is under investigation.

　　乌江渡库区发生大爆炸    
    死２８人　伤１６人　原因待查
    据新华社贵阳５月３日电  （记者何天文）贵州省乌江渡水电站在处理库区危崖时发生特大恶性爆炸事故。事故中有２８人死亡，１６人受伤。
    这次事故４月２６日发生在对乌江渡电站旁边的危崖实施爆破过程中。耸立在乌江渡水电站大坝左侧４００余米处库区边的大黄崖，由于地质条件差，岩体裂隙发育，且风化破碎，严重威胁着装机容量达６０多万千瓦的水电站安全，经有关方面批准，由中南勘测设计院设计，对大黄崖不稳定岩体开挖导洞２０００米采取洞室爆破，以消除隐患。３月４日，施工人员成功地进行了首次洞室爆破。不久，第二次爆破也成功了。根据设计，４月２６日，在共有３６个炸药室的导洞内进行最后一次爆破。上午１１时２２分，在施工人员对２７号药室进行装药过程中突然发生了爆炸。何以突然爆炸，原因待查。
