Today, our newspaper reprints a letter written by seven middle-aged intellectuals to the editorial department of the Beijing Daily. This letter expresses their anxiety about the current situation in the capital, their concern for the future of the nation, and their worry for the interests of the people across the country. This deep sense of unease, this heartfelt call, is something that every citizen who loves the motherland should listen to carefully and reflect on deeply.

What is in the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups in the country? It is to "realize the Four Modernizations and revitalize China." To achieve this goal, we must firmly adhere to economic construction as the center, placing the development of productive forces in the foremost position. If this center is affected or disrupted, it will hinder the realization of our struggle goals. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the tasks of rectification and reform have been arduous, and many problems in economic construction urgently need to be addressed with great effort. If we lose focus or get distracted, the tasks of rectification and reform will not be completed on schedule. Currently, whether it is economic construction or the tasks of rectification and reform, they have indeed been affected to some extent. If this continues, the situation will become more severe, and the interests of the people across the country will suffer greatly.

Building socialist democratic politics is a steadfast policy confirmed by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, a common demand of the people across the country, and an irresistible historical trend. Fundamentally, it does not conflict with the development of productive forces but will greatly promote the development of productive forces. However, in our country, the construction of democratic politics will inevitably go through a long process and cannot be achieved overnight. The construction of democratic politics must be carried out on the track of the legal system and must be adapted to the development of economic construction. Learning to solve problems on the track of democracy and the legal system is not an easy task. It requires establishing a long-term perspective and taking appropriate steps to steadily advance the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system.

The broad masses of young students demand the advancement of democratic political construction, the promotion of reform and opening up, the punishment of corrupt officials, and the elimination of corruption. This is consistent with the goals of the Party and the government. The Party and the government fully affirm the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students; at the same time, they hope that they will remain calm and rational, solving problems on the track of democracy and the legal system. Stabilizing the situation and controlling the further deterioration of the situation is the overriding priority at the moment. Now, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council have taken a series of emergency measures for this purpose. The seven middle-aged intellectuals, with their personal experiences during the Cultural Revolution, have made a sincere appeal, hoping that young friends will remember the lessons of history, and together strive to stabilize the situation and promote the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system. Their heartfelt advice is indeed weighty and meaningful.

For the construction of the capital, for the future of the country, and for the highest interests of the people across the country, it is necessary to calm down and think carefully before acting.

　　以全国人民的利益为重
    本报评论员
    今天，本报转载了七名中年知识分子写给北京日报编辑部的信。这封信表达了他们对当前首都形势焦虑的心情，对国家前途焦虑的心情，对全国人民利益焦虑的心情。这深沉的忧患意识，这发自内心的呼声，很值得每一个热爱祖国的公民认真地倾听、深刻地思索。
    什么是全国各族人民的根本利益所在？就是“实现四化，振兴中华”。要达到这个目标，必须牢牢坚持以经济建设为中心，把发展社会生产力放在首要的地位。如果影响了这个中心，干扰了这个中心，就会妨碍实现我们的奋斗目标。党的十三届三中全会以来，治理整顿、深化改革的任务十分艰巨，经济建设中的许多问题亟待花很大气力去解决。如果分了心，走了神，治理整顿、深化改革的任务也就不能如期完成。当前，经济建设也好，治理整顿、深化改革的任务也好，确实已开始受到一定的影响，继续发展下去，形势将变得更加严峻，全国人民的利益都将受到巨大的损害。
    建设社会主义民主政治，是党的十三大确定的坚定不移的方针，是全国人民的共同要求，是不可阻挡的历史潮流。从根本上来说，它同发展生产力不但不矛盾，而且将对发展生产力起极大的推动作用。但是，在我国，民主政治的建设必然要经历一个长期的过程，不可能一蹴而就。民主政治的建设必须在法制的轨道上进行，必须与经济建设的发展相适应。学习在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题，不是一件容易的事，需要树立长期的观点，又采取恰当的步骤，才能把社会主义民主和法制的建设扎扎实实地推向前进。
    广大青年学生要求推进民主政治建设，推进改革开放，惩治官倒、清除腐败，这同党和政府的目标是一致的。党和政府充分肯定广大青年学生的爱国热情；同时又希望他们冷静、理智，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。稳定局面，控制事态的进一步恶化，这是眼下压倒一切的大局。现在，党中央、国务院已为此采取了一系列紧急措施。七位中年知识分子以他们在“文革”中亲身的经验发出恳切的呼吁，希望青年朋友们牢记历史的经验教训，共同为稳定形势，推进社会主义民主和法制建设作出努力，他们发自肺腑的忠告确实语重心长。
    为了首都的建设，为了国家的前途，为了全国人民的最高利益，是应该冷静下来，三思而后行了。
