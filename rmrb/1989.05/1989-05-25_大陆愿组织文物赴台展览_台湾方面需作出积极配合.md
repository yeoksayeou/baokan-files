The mainland is willing to organize artifacts to exhibit in Taiwan. The Taiwan side needs to make active cooperation.

Beijing, May 25 (People's Daily) - Reporter Tao Shian reports: "As cross-strait relations ease and cultural exchanges increase, we hope to see mainland artifacts exhibited in Taiwan as soon as possible. This will allow compatriots in Taiwan to appreciate the precious artifacts unearthed on the mainland, deepen their understanding of the 5,000-year history and culture of the Chinese nation, and increase mutual understanding of national culture. This will help to further eliminate barriers, build trust, and increase mutual understanding."

A responsible official from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage said in an interview with a reporter that they will focus on organizing some representative artifacts unearthed after 1949 to be exhibited in Taiwan, allowing compatriots in Taiwan to personally appreciate the treasures of the Chinese nation.

"This official also said, 'The two sides of the Taiwan Strait are a unified entity of Chinese culture. Both sides have a common understanding of traditional Chinese culture.' This official happily said, 'The centripetal force and cohesion generated by cultural identity will not disappear due to temporal and spatial separation, but will become more intense and stronger with the passage of time. Ending the political division between the two sides has become a common voice of the people on both sides.'"

This official also pointed out that the traditional culture of the Chinese nation is very rich. Through Chinese artifacts from various dynasties, one can see the splendor of Chinese culture. The artifacts left by our ancestors are the common wealth of the people on both sides. Inheriting and carrying forward the brilliant historical culture of the Chinese nation is a common responsibility of the Chinese people on both sides.

In the past one or two years, some units and individuals at home and abroad who are enthusiastic about the cause have contacted the mainland through various channels to organize the exhibition of artifacts in Taiwan. However, so far, none of them have made substantial progress. The main reason is that the Taiwan side has not yet formulated relevant laws and regulations to ensure that the national treasures and artifacts sent by the mainland for exhibition can be safely and smoothly returned to the mainland.

The official from the State Administration of Cultural Heritage told the reporter: The cultural circles on the mainland have noticed that, through the appeal of public opinion on the island and the efforts of people from all walks of life, especially legal professionals, the "Interim Measures for the Relations between the People of the Taiwan Region and the Mainland Region" drafted by the "Ministry of Justice" has written that cultural assets with historical, cultural, and artistic value from the mainland region, with the approval of the "government," can be publicly exhibited in the Taiwan region and allowed to be taken out. This legal regulation has its positive significance. Currently, this "Interim Measures" is still being discussed at the "Executive Yuan's Mainland Affairs Council" and will later need to be reviewed by the "Legislative Yuan." It is hoped that the Taiwan authorities will take some corresponding steps for the exhibition of mainland artifacts in Taiwan. As long as the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cooperate with each other, the wish of the island's people to see the national treasures will soon be realized.

　　大陆愿组织文物赴台展览
    台湾方面需作出积极配合
    本报北京讯  记者陶世安报道：“海峡两岸关系趋于缓和，文化交流日渐增多，我们愿意看到，大陆的文物能早日赴台湾展览。这样可以让台湾同胞观赏大陆出土的珍贵文物，加深对中华民族五千年历史文化的了解，增进两岸对民族文化的共识，有助于进一步消除隔阂，沟通感情，增加信任。”国家文物局负责官员，日前接受记者采访时说了这番话。
    这位官员还表示，将着重组织一些１９４９年后出土的具有代表性的文物到台湾展出，使台湾同胞得以亲眼欣赏中华民族的瑰宝。
    “海峡两岸是中华文化的统一体，两岸人民对于中华传统文化有着普遍的共识。”这位官员高兴地说道，“这种根植于文化认同所产生的向心力和凝聚力，不会因时空的阻隔而消失，只会随着时光的漫步而愈加炽热、愈加强烈。结束两岸政治上的分裂局面，已成为两岸人民的共同心声。”
    这位官员还指出，中华民族的传统文化内涵非常丰富。透过历代中国文物可以窥见中华文化的辉煌。祖先留下来的文物，是两岸人民的共同财富。继承和弘扬中华民族光辉灿烂的历史文化，更是两岸中国人共同的责任。
    近一两年来，海内外一些热心的单位和人士，通过各种渠道与大陆联系组织文物赴台展出事宜。但是，迄今尚未有一起取得实质性的进展。原因主要在于，台湾方面至今尚未制定有关的法律规定，确保大陆送去展出的国宝和文物，能够安全顺利地返回大陆。
    国家文物局官员告诉记者：大陆的文物界已经注意到，经过岛内舆论的呼吁，各界人士特别是法律界人士的努力，台“法务部”研拟的《台湾地区和大陆地区人民关系暂行条例》中已写上，大陆地区具有历史文化艺术价值之文化资产，经“政府”许可，得在台湾地区公开展览，并准予运出。这一法律规定有其积极意义。目前这个“暂行条例”尚在台“行政院大陆工作会报”研讨，其后还需经台“立法院”审议。希望台湾当局，为大陆文物赴台展出作出一些相应的步骤。只要海峡两岸相互配合，岛内民众一睹国宝风采的夙愿，很快就可以实现。
