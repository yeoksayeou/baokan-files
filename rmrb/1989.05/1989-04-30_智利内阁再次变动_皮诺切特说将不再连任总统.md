	Chile's Cabinet Shuffles Again
	Pinochet Announces He Will Not Seek Re-election

	Beijing, April 30 (Xinhua) - The Chilean cabinet resigned en masse on the evening of April 26, marking the second cabinet resignation in a month.

	The government spokesman said that the cabinet ministers submitted their resignations at the cabinet meeting on April 26 at the request of President Pinochet. On April 28, Pinochet reorganized the cabinet, appointing Jorge Lopez Bein as the new Minister of Mining and Rene Salame as the new Minister of Education, while the rest of the original cabinet members remained in their positions. According to reports, the main reason for the cabinet reshuffle was a disagreement between the Minister of the Interior (the chief minister) responsible for negotiating constitutional amendments with the opposition and President Pinochet. After the opposition defeated Pinochet's bid for re-election in a referendum last October, they proposed amending the constitution. The government and the opposition held negotiations on this issue. However, the two sides' positions were far apart. Recently, the opposition and the pro-government National Party reached an understanding on the constitutional amendment, which put pressure on the government. The government spokesman said on April 26 that the cabinet resignation did not rule out the possibility of amending the constitution through a referendum.

	Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, April 29 - Chilean President Pinochet announced at a press conference on April 28 that he would not run for president in the December elections this year, but would continue to serve as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces after handing over the presidential power in March 1990.

	Pinochet stated that after his presidential term ends in March 1990, he will return to the military camp.

	President Pinochet also said that the government would "improve" the constitution in six areas, including shortening the presidential term and abolishing the president's power to dissolve the House of Representatives and expel citizens from the country.

### 智利内阁再次变动  皮诺切特说将不再连任总统

　　智利内阁再次变动     
    皮诺切特说将不再连任总统
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯电  记者李志明报道：圣地亚哥消息：智利内阁４月２６日晚上全体辞职，这是一个月内第二次内阁辞职。
    政府发言人说，内阁部长们是在４月２６日的内阁会议之后，应皮诺切特总统的要求提出辞职的。２８日，皮诺切特改组了内阁，任命豪尔赫·洛佩斯·贝恩为新的矿业部长，雷内·萨拉梅为新的教育部长，其余原内阁成员留任。据报道，内阁变动的主要原因是，负责与反对党谈判修改宪法问题的内政部长（首席部长）同皮诺切特总统发生意见分歧。去年１０月，反对党在公民投票中击败皮诺切特连任总统的企图后提出修改宪法。政府方面与反对党就此举行谈判。但是，双方立场相去甚远。最近，反对党同亲政府的国民党就修宪问题达成了谅解，这对政府是一种无形的压力。政府发言人２６日对新闻界说，内阁辞职并不意味着排除通过一次公民投票修改宪法的可能性。
    新华社圣地亚哥４月２９日电　智利总统皮诺切特２８日举行记者招待会宣布，他将不会作为总统候选人参加今年１２月份的大选，但在１９９０年３月交出总统权力之后，将继续担任武装部队总司令。
    皮诺切特表示，他在１９９０年３月总统任期结束后，将返回军营。
    皮诺切特总统还说，政府将在６个方面“完善”宪法，其中包括缩短总统任期，废除总统有权解散众议院和把公民驱逐出境的规定。
