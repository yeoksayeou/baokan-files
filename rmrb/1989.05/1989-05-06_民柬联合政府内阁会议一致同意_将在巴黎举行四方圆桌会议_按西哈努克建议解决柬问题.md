The Cambodian United Front Government held a cabinet meeting last night in Bangkok. The meeting emphasized that Prince Sihanouk's five-point peace proposal remains the basis for a political solution to the Cambodian problem.

The meeting issued a news bulletin stating that this cabinet meeting was chaired by Prince Sihanouk of the Cambodian United Front. The meeting discussed the current progress in seeking a political solution to the Cambodian problem. It unanimously agreed that by the end of this year, a four-party round table conference on Cambodia and an international conference on the Cambodian issue will be held in Paris, France, chaired by Prince Sihanouk. The aim is to seek a political solution to the Cambodian problem based on Prince Sihanouk's five-point peace proposal.

The meeting reiterated that the necessary conditions for a reasonable and permanent political solution to the Cambodian problem are: the Vietnamese army must withdraw completely from Cambodia under effective international supervision and control; a temporary four-party joint government led by Prince Sihanouk must be established, and under strict international supervision, a general election must be organized by the temporary four-party joint government; and an international peacekeeping force must be deployed in Cambodia.

　　民柬联合政府内阁会议一致同意    
    将在巴黎举行四方圆桌会议    
    按西哈努克建议解决柬问题
    本报曼谷５月６日电  记者刘爱成报道：民柬联合政府昨晚在这里举行内阁会议，强调西哈努克亲王的５点和平建议仍是政治解决柬埔寨问题的基础。
    会议发表新闻公报说，这次内阁会议是由民柬主席西哈努克亲王主持召开的。会议讨论了目前寻求政治解决柬埔寨问题的进展情况。一致同意，今年底在法国巴黎举行一次由西哈努克亲王主持的柬埔寨四方圆桌会议和关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议，以便在西哈努克亲王的５点和平建议基础上寻求柬埔寨问题政治解决。
    会议重申，使柬问题获得合理和永久政治解决的必要条件是：越军必须在有效的国际监督和控制之下全部从柬埔寨撤走；建立由西哈努克亲王领导的临时四方联合政府，并在严格的国际监督之下由临时四方联合政府组织大选；在柬埔寨部署国际维持和平部队。
