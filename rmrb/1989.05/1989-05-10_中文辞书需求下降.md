	Demand for Chinese dictionaries has been gradually declining in recent years. Taking Shanghai New Hua Bookstore as an example, the number of different titles has been increasing year by year, but the total number of copies has been decreasing. For instance, in 1988, 329 different titles were issued, totaling 388,000 copies, which is a 29.5% increase in titles compared to 1987, but a 31.1% decrease in the number of copies.

	The main reason for the decline is the large cumulative number of Chinese dictionaries issued. From 1980 to 1988, Shanghai New Hua Bookstore issued a total of 9.5 million copies of Chinese dictionaries. Calculating based on the 3.8 million households in the city, this averages to 2.5 copies per household, thus reducing the demand for new Chinese dictionaries. Additionally, with the surge in the trend of studying abroad, students at all levels have shown high enthusiasm for learning foreign languages, leading to a relative decrease in demand for Chinese dictionaries.

	With the development of education, science, and culture, and the specialization of knowledge, there has been a significant change in the demand for dictionaries at various levels. From the supply situation of Chinese dictionaries in bookstores, small-sized dictionaries have decreased, medium-sized ones have increased; knowledge-oriented dictionaries have remained stable, while practical ones have become more popular; comprehensive dictionaries have decreased, while specialized ones have increased.

	Based on the current situation, it is estimated that the overall trend for Chinese dictionaries this year will be stable with a slight decline; the number of published titles will continue to increase, and competition will become more intense.

### 中文辞书需求下降

　　中文辞书需求下降
    本报讯近几年来，中文辞书需求逐步下降。以上海新华书店发货为例，品种逐年增加，册数不断减少。如：１９８８年发３２９种、３８．８万册，与１９８７年相比，品种增加２９．５％，册数减少３１．１％。
    下降原因主要是中文辞书累计发行量较大。１９８０年到１９８８年，上海新华书店共发行中文辞书９５０万册，按全市３８０万户居民计算，平均每户２．５册，对中文辞书新的需求相应减少。同时，在“出国热”冲击下，大中学生学习外语的积极性较高，对中文辞书的需求相对下降。
    随着教育、科学、文化事业的发展和知识专业化，带来对辞书多层次的需求，销售结构上也发生了不小的变化。从门市部中文辞书供应情况看，小型的减少，中型的增加；知识型平稳，实用型趋热；综合型下降，专业型上升。
    根据目前情况分析，预计今年中文辞书需求的总趋势是稳中有降；出版品种继续增加，竞争将更为激烈。
