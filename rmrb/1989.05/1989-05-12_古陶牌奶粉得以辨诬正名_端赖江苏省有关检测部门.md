In mid-December 1987, the Pingyao County Dairy Products Factory in Shanxi Province sold 10 tons of Ancient Tao Brand full-fat milk powder to the Sugar and Alcohol Company in Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province. At that time, Xuzhou received an anonymous letter purportedly from a quality inspector at Pingyao County Dairy Products Factory. This anonymous letter stated: "Our factory's inspection standards are not up to par, and the bacterial content in the milk powder exceeds the standards. Please do not sell it." In early January 1988, the Xuzhou Sugar and Alcohol Company sent a telegram to Pingyao County Dairy Products Factory to suspend the contract and refuse payment. The anonymous letter was also sent to the Xuzhou City Epidemic Prevention Station, instructing its subordinate city and six counties to stop purchasing and selling Ancient Tao Brand milk powder. Subsequently, more than 20 units in Zhenjiang, Liuzhou, Zhuzhou, and Jiuquan also received similar anonymous letters.

The anonymous letter caused great distress for the producers and distributors of Ancient Tao Brand milk powder. The factory director, Chang Xuewen, cried out, "I don't know who I've offended. Even if you're not satisfied with me, you shouldn't mess with everyone's business like this!"

The relevant departments in Xuzhou City did not blindly believe the anonymous letter and conducted a thorough sampling inspection. The inspection results proved that all indicators of Ancient Tao Brand milk powder met the national standards. The Xuzhou City Epidemic Prevention Station specifically cleared the name of Ancient Tao Brand milk powder at a meeting. In the first half of 1988, the Zhenjiang City Dairy Company in Jiangsu Province sent people to inspect the Pingyao Dairy Products Factory and subsequently ordered 67 tons of milk powder. In July 1988, an anonymous letter was sent to the Zhenjiang City Government, the City Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the City Epidemic Prevention Station. The Zhenjiang City Dairy Company sent Ancient Tao Brand milk powder to the highest testing authority in Jiangsu Province, the Yangzhou Senior Commercial Testing Center, for inspection. This authoritative testing unit again cleared the name of Ancient Tao Brand milk powder. The Shanghai branch of the China Grain and Oil Import and Export Company sent people to inspect the Pingyao County Dairy Products Factory and placed an order for 70 tons, with a requirement for 400 tons of supply in 1989.

Due to the widespread dissemination of this anonymous letter, Pingyao County Dairy Products Factory suffered a loss of 100,000 yuan. However, because Ancient Tao Brand milk powder underwent more than 20 inspections by customers, it attracted more and more customers, which was something the writer of the anonymous letter did not expect. Ancient Tao Brand milk powder was able to clear its name and restore its reputation, truly thanks to the relevant testing departments in Jiangsu Province and the cities of Xuzhou and Zhenjiang.

　　古陶牌奶粉得以辨诬正名  端赖江苏省有关检测部门
    １９８７年１２月上旬，山西平遥县乳制品厂将１０吨古陶牌全脂牛奶粉卖给江苏徐州市糖酒公司。这时，徐州方面收到一封匿名为平遥县乳制品厂化验员的“揭发信”。这封匿名信称：“我厂化验水平不过关，奶粉的细菌超出指标，望你们不要销售。”１９８８年１月上旬，徐州市糖酒公司向平遥县乳制品厂发了中止合同、拒付货款的电报。匿名信还寄到了徐州市卫生防疫站，让其所属的１市６县停止购销古陶牌奶粉。此后，镇江、柳州、株洲、酒泉等地的２０多个单位也收到同样内容的匿名信。
    匿名信弄得古陶牌奶粉的生产者和经销者有苦难言。厂长常学温哭了：“不知道我把谁得罪了，你就是对我再不满，也不该拿大家的事业瞎折腾呀！”
    徐州市有关部门倒没有轻信匿名信所述，认真进行了抽样化验，化验结果证明古陶牌奶粉各项指标全部符合部颁标准。徐州市防疫站在会上专门为古陶牌奶粉正名。１９８８年上半年，江苏镇江市牛奶公司派人到平遥乳制品厂实地考察，先后订购奶粉６７吨。１９８８年７月，匿名信寄到了镇江市人民政府、市工商局、市防疫站。镇江市牛奶公司把古陶牌奶粉送到江苏省最高检测机构扬州高级商测中心检验，这家权威化验单位又为古陶牌奶粉正名。中国粮油进出口公司上海分公司派人到平遥县乳制品厂考察后，一次订货７０吨，并要求厂家１９８９年供货４００吨。
    由于这封匿名信四处散发，给平遥县乳制品厂造成了１０万元的损失。但由于古陶牌奶粉先后经受了２０多次顾主的化验，反而引来了越来越多的顾主，这是写匿名信的人所没有料到的。古陶牌奶粉得以辨诬正名，真得感谢江苏省和徐州市、镇江市有关检测部门。
