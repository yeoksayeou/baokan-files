A wave of "revitalizing education" is sweeping across the United States. Currently, the U.S. government has prioritized strengthening basic education, with primary and secondary educational institutions emphasizing "openness to the outside world" and drawing on the strengths of various countries. Many elementary and middle schools have made foreign languages, foreign cultures, world history, and geography compulsory subjects. Several renowned universities have begun training students in various parts of the world.

The most notable initiative is the "2061 Plan," aimed at reforming the entire primary and secondary education system. If successful, this unprecedented and far-reaching plan will not only bring about fundamental changes in U.S. basic education but also have profound and immeasurable impacts on national quality, social economy, science, technology, and culture.

The Crisis: Where Did It Come From?

The United States has always prioritized national education and was one of the first countries to implement compulsory education laws. The widespread education system played a crucial role in the U.S. becoming an economically developed and technologically advanced global power within a century after independence.

A strong sense of educational crisis emerged in the 1950s. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union announced the successful launch of the first artificial satellite in human history. The news shocked the nation. Some U.S. scientific authorities compared the educational gaps between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, concluding that "Soviet students in their ten-year schools, especially in mathematics, generally surpass U.S. college students; only by rescuing education can we rescue the future of America, thereby ensuring America's future." One of the significant measures taken by the U.S. at the time was to spend over ten billion dollars to rewrite all the textbooks for mathematics, science, chemistry, and other scientific courses in middle and elementary schools over several years. This effort effectively improved the quality of education.

Since the 1980s, various types of educational institutions, filled with talent and advanced equipment, have spread across U.S. cities and rural areas. The country's annual public and private education funding has reached approximately $200 billion. Despite this, many enlightened individuals still feel that U.S. education is facing another crisis. The prevailing view is that:

1. The U.S.'s share in the global economy is declining, the competitiveness of U.S. industrial products in the international market has weakened, and the U.S.'s leading position in science and technology is being challenged. One of the main reasons is that the quality of U.S. education has fallen behind its strongest economic competitor, Japan.
2. U.S. middle and elementary school students have weak foundations in science and technology. In international science knowledge competitions, U.S. students rank among the lowest. Currently, the number of foreign students pursuing advanced degrees in U.S. universities and research institutions exceeds that of U.S. students. Given the current technological level of the U.S. workforce, it cannot guarantee the future progress of U.S. industry. The new U.S. Secretary of Education, Lauro Cavazos, stated that the U.S. is currently facing three deficits: trade, budget, and education. "The last deficit may be the most serious."
3. The rapid development and fierce competition in global science and technology, along with their mutual influence, have raised higher demands for U.S. education.

Meanwhile, numerous books discussing educational reform have emerged, with over 20 notable ones. These books examine the current state and deficiencies of U.S. education from various angles, suggesting radical reforms to the educational system to better meet the needs of economic development based on modern science and technology.

The "2061 Plan" was born against this backdrop.

Goal: The 21st Century

In 1985, the renowned U.S. non-governmental scientific organization, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), with the support of the National Science and Technology Education Commission and other institutions and enterprises, invited approximately 400 scientists, professors, teachers, and leaders from various scientific and educational institutions both domestically and internationally. Over four years, they jointly drafted and reviewed the "2061 Plan: Science for All Americans." The subtitle is: "The 2061 Report on Goals for Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education." This 200-page comprehensive report, along with five other specialized reports, detailed the vision, steps, goals, and scientific basis for comprehensively reforming the U.S. primary and secondary education system.

The plan believes that all children need and should receive basic education in science (including physics, chemistry, biology, and other natural and social sciences), mathematics, and technology, enabling them to live colorful and fruitful lives. This basic education should adapt to the "rapid growth of scientific knowledge and technological power." However, currently, most Americans are scientifically illiterate; U.S. students' problem-solving abilities lag far behind international standards. In 1986, the average knowledge level of 17-year-old students was significantly lower than in 1969; most elementary school teachers have not received basic science and mathematics education; scientific knowledge education methods are still at the 19th-century level; textbook content is outdated, and the curriculum is cumbersome, hindering rather than promoting students' acquisition of knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary to fundamentally reform educational ideas, textbooks, curriculum arrangements, teaching guidance, and the entire teaching system from kindergarten to high school. The target of the reform is the existing basic science education system.

According to the "2061 Plan," this reform will be a long and complex process, consisting of three stages. The first stage, planning, lasted four years and has been completed. In February of this year, the plan was announced, and the second stage began. The goal is to provide a series of demonstrations through pilot projects for nationwide educational reform. The main contents include organizing new courses, using new teaching methods, training teachers, experimenting with new teaching materials and modern technology, exploring new teaching methods, and providing reform policy suggestions for the federal and local governments. Additionally, a small group consisting of 20 teachers, 3 principals, and two university education experts has been established. They will dedicate three to four days each month and two summers over four years to research, summarize the experiences of various pilot projects, and compile textbook samples for nationwide promotion based on the reform practice.

In 1993, the crucial third stage will begin. The plan aims to convert the results of the previous stage's experiments into nationwide educational practices over approximately ten years through the joint efforts of various scientific organizations, educational institutions, and other relevant departments, achieving the ultimate goals proposed by the "2061 Plan."

The "2061 Plan" is called the "most ambitious" educational plan by the U.S. media. In terms of overall scale, it will far exceed the textbook reform of the late 1950s. When explaining the origin of the plan's name, a responsible person said that the mysterious Halley's Comet last passed by Earth in 1985, the year the plan was initiated. The next time will be in 2061, when the beneficiaries of this reform plan will personally witness the return of this beautiful comet.

Reforming Traditional Textbooks and Teaching Methods

The "2061 Plan" points out that the ultimate goal of education is to enable the educated to achieve personal success and fulfill social responsibilities in the future. Therefore, science education should help cultivate students' understanding and thinking habits for solving practical problems. The future of America is more dependent than ever on the nature and quality of children's education.

The first focus of the reform is textbooks. The plan believes that the current curriculum content is "both extensive and nutritionally poor." Over the decades, these courses have expanded uncontrollably, burdening most teachers and students with heavy loads but failing to grasp the basic essence of science, mathematics, and technology.

The premise of textbook reform is to determine and select appropriate textbook content. To this end, experts, based on the current global technological development trends, have engaged in long-term and repeated discussions to reach a consensus. They have condensed the basic scientific knowledge that each student should acquire in 13 years of education into 12 categories: the essence of science, mathematics, and technology (general principles); the remaining nine categories are the composition of the natural world, living environment, human physiology, human society, technological world, mathematical world, scientific perspectives, common themes, and thinking habits.

The plan believes that the teaching methods inherited to this day only emphasize students' mastery of ready-made answers while ignoring the exploration of problems. Students memorize fragmented pieces of knowledge without understanding their origins and interconnections. This method replaces debate with memorization, reading with hands-on experience, "cannot encourage students to cooperate, freely share knowledge and ideas, or use modern instruments to expand their intelligence." To address these issues, the plan's chief, Rutherford, stated that the curriculum should be streamlined, and students should be encouraged to think independently, use their hands and brains, and enhance their thinking and problem-solving abilities.

According to expert suggestions, students from kindergarten to high school graduation will study only a dozen courses, each integrating natural science, social science, and mathematics knowledge, along with necessary skill training. It forms a system but is not self-contained, allowing for the integration of various subjects' knowledge. For example, in the "evolution" course, students not only learn about biological evolution but also understand the evolution of political systems. The advantage of this teaching method is that students can systematically learn the basic knowledge of a particular course while integrating and connecting other knowledge, which is beneficial for the comprehensive development of intelligence. At the same time, it can avoid the current phenomenon of redundant repetition of the same course or isolation between different courses.

Currently, the reform of textbooks and teaching methods in the U.S. has just begun, and many aspects are still in the conceptual or principle stage. Despite this, the basic ideas of the "2061 Plan" and the blueprint it outlines for U.S. primary and secondary education are still worth noting.

Editor's Postscript

Today, this page publishes three articles introducing the development and reform of education in the United States, Bulgaria, and Oman. The two articles on the United States and Oman are particularly thought-provoking.

The development types of the United States and Oman are vastly different, and their development levels are extremely disparate, but they share a common point: they value education. Under the rule of King Qaboos, Oman's educational landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation, from having only three primary schools and 909 students to owning 720 schools of various levels and more than 300,000 students! However, the Omani authorities do not rest on their laurels and are determined to eradicate illiteracy by the end of the century.

The universality and advancement of American education are widely recognized, but it does not stagnate. Instead, it keeps pace with the changing situation and practical needs, proposing an extremely bold plan to thoroughly reform education, the "2061 Plan," aiming to ensure that America's science and technology remain at the forefront of the world as it enters the 21st century.

Historical experience proves that education is the foundation of a nation. Currently, developing and reforming education has become a global trend. Valuing education provides the momentum for economic development and national prosperity. Conversely, it will inevitably lead to backwardness and decline. Any forward-looking nation should seize the opportunity, make far-sighted decisions for the development of education!
