A wave of "revitalizing education" is sweeping across the United States. Currently, the U.S. government has prioritized strengthening basic education, with primary and secondary educational institutions emphasizing "openness to the outside world" and drawing on the strengths of various countries. Many elementary and middle schools have made foreign languages, foreign cultures, world history, and geography compulsory subjects. Several renowned universities have begun training students in various parts of the world.

The most notable initiative is the "2061 Plan," aimed at reforming the entire primary and secondary education system. If successful, this unprecedented and far-reaching plan will not only bring about fundamental changes in U.S. basic education but also have profound and immeasurable impacts on national quality, social economy, science, technology, and culture.

The Crisis: Where Did It Come From?

The United States has always prioritized national education and was one of the first countries to implement compulsory education laws. The widespread education system played a crucial role in the U.S. becoming an economically developed and technologically advanced global power within a century after independence.

A strong sense of educational crisis emerged in the 1950s. On October 4, 1957, the Soviet Union announced the successful launch of the first artificial satellite in human history. The news shocked the nation. Some U.S. scientific authorities compared the educational gaps between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, concluding that "Soviet students in their ten-year schools, especially in mathematics, generally surpass U.S. college students; only by rescuing education can we rescue the future of America, thereby ensuring America's future." One of the significant measures taken by the U.S. at the time was to spend over ten billion dollars to rewrite all the textbooks for mathematics, science, chemistry, and other scientific courses in middle and elementary schools over several years. This effort effectively improved the quality of education.

Since the 1980s, various types of educational institutions, filled with talent and advanced equipment, have spread across U.S. cities and rural areas. The country's annual public and private education funding has reached approximately $200 billion. Despite this, many enlightened individuals still feel that U.S. education is facing another crisis. The prevailing view is that:

1. The U.S.'s share in the global economy is declining, the competitiveness of U.S. industrial products in the international market has weakened, and the U.S.'s leading position in science and technology is being challenged. One of the main reasons is that the quality of U.S. education has fallen behind its strongest economic competitor, Japan.
2. U.S. middle and elementary school students have weak foundations in science and technology. In international science knowledge competitions, U.S. students rank among the lowest. Currently, the number of foreign students pursuing advanced degrees in U.S. universities and research institutions exceeds that of U.S. students. Given the current technological level of the U.S. workforce, it cannot guarantee the future progress of U.S. industry. The new U.S. Secretary of Education, Lauro Cavazos, stated that the U.S. is currently facing three deficits: trade, budget, and education. "The last deficit may be the most serious."
3. The rapid development and fierce competition in global science and technology, along with their mutual influence, have raised higher demands for U.S. education.

Meanwhile, numerous books discussing educational reform have emerged, with over 20 notable ones. These books examine the current state and deficiencies of U.S. education from various angles, suggesting radical reforms to the educational system to better meet the needs of economic development based on modern science and technology.

The "2061 Plan" was born against this backdrop.

Goal: The 21st Century

In 1985, the renowned U.S. non-governmental scientific organization, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), with the support of the National Science and Technology Education Commission and other institutions and enterprises, invited approximately 400 scientists, professors, teachers, and leaders from various scientific and educational institutions both domestically and internationally. Over four years, they jointly drafted and reviewed the "2061 Plan: Science for All Americans." The subtitle is: "The 2061 Report on Goals for Science, Mathematics, and Technology Education." This 200-page comprehensive report, along with five other specialized reports, detailed the vision, steps, goals, and scientific basis for comprehensively reforming the U.S. primary and secondary education system.

The plan believes that all children need and should receive basic education in science (including physics, chemistry, biology, and other natural and social sciences), mathematics, and technology, enabling them to live colorful and fruitful lives. This basic education should adapt to the "rapid growth of scientific knowledge and technological power." However, currently, most Americans are scientifically illiterate; U.S. students' problem-solving abilities lag far behind international standards. In 1986, the average knowledge level of 17-year-old students was significantly lower than in 1969; most elementary school teachers have not received basic science and mathematics education; scientific knowledge education methods are still at the 19th-century level; textbook content is outdated, and the curriculum is cumbersome, hindering rather than promoting students' acquisition of knowledge. Therefore, it is necessary to fundamentally reform educational ideas, textbooks, curriculum arrangements, teaching guidance, and the entire teaching system from kindergarten to high school. The target of the reform is the existing basic science education system.

According to the "2061 Plan," this reform will be a long and complex process, consisting of three stages. The first stage, planning, lasted four years and has been completed. In February of this year, the plan was announced, and the second stage began. The goal is to provide a series of demonstrations through pilot projects for nationwide educational reform. The main contents include organizing new courses, using new teaching methods, training teachers, experimenting with new teaching materials and modern technology, exploring new teaching methods, and providing reform policy suggestions for the federal and local governments. Additionally, a small group consisting of 20 teachers, 3 principals, and two university education experts has been established. They will dedicate three to four days each month and two summers over four years to research, summarize the experiences of various pilot projects, and compile textbook samples for nationwide promotion based on the reform practice.

In 1993, the crucial third stage will begin. The plan aims to convert the results of the previous stage's experiments into nationwide educational practices over approximately ten years through the joint efforts of various scientific organizations, educational institutions, and other relevant departments, achieving the ultimate goals proposed by the "2061 Plan."

The "2061 Plan" is called the "most ambitious" educational plan by the U.S. media. In terms of overall scale, it will far exceed the textbook reform of the late 1950s. When explaining the origin of the plan's name, a responsible person said that the mysterious Halley's Comet last passed by Earth in 1985, the year the plan was initiated. The next time will be in 2061, when the beneficiaries of this reform plan will personally witness the return of this beautiful comet.

Reforming Traditional Textbooks and Teaching Methods

The "2061 Plan" points out that the ultimate goal of education is to enable the educated to achieve personal success and fulfill social responsibilities in the future. Therefore, science education should help cultivate students' understanding and thinking habits for solving practical problems. The future of America is more dependent than ever on the nature and quality of children's education.

The first focus of the reform is textbooks. The plan believes that the current curriculum content is "both extensive and nutritionally poor." Over the decades, these courses have expanded uncontrollably, burdening most teachers and students with heavy loads but failing to grasp the basic essence of science, mathematics, and technology.

The premise of textbook reform is to determine and select appropriate textbook content. To this end, experts, based on the current global technological development trends, have engaged in long-term and repeated discussions to reach a consensus. They have condensed the basic scientific knowledge that each student should acquire in 13 years of education into 12 categories: the essence of science, mathematics, and technology (general principles); the remaining nine categories are the composition of the natural world, living environment, human physiology, human society, technological world, mathematical world, scientific perspectives, common themes, and thinking habits.

The plan believes that the teaching methods inherited to this day only emphasize students' mastery of ready-made answers while ignoring the exploration of problems. Students memorize fragmented pieces of knowledge without understanding their origins and interconnections. This method replaces debate with memorization, reading with hands-on experience, "cannot encourage students to cooperate, freely share knowledge and ideas, or use modern instruments to expand their intelligence." To address these issues, the plan's chief, Rutherford, stated that the curriculum should be streamlined, and students should be encouraged to think independently, use their hands and brains, and enhance their thinking and problem-solving abilities.

According to expert suggestions, students from kindergarten to high school graduation will study only a dozen courses, each integrating natural science, social science, and mathematics knowledge, along with necessary skill training. It forms a system but is not self-contained, allowing for the integration of various subjects' knowledge. For example, in the "evolution" course, students not only learn about biological evolution but also understand the evolution of political systems. The advantage of this teaching method is that students can systematically learn the basic knowledge of a particular course while integrating and connecting other knowledge, which is beneficial for the comprehensive development of intelligence. At the same time, it can avoid the current phenomenon of redundant repetition of the same course or isolation between different courses.

Currently, the reform of textbooks and teaching methods in the U.S. has just begun, and many aspects are still in the conceptual or principle stage. Despite this, the basic ideas of the "2061 Plan" and the blueprint it outlines for U.S. primary and secondary education are still worth noting.

Editor's Postscript

Today, this page publishes three articles introducing the development and reform of education in the United States, Bulgaria, and Oman. The two articles on the United States and Oman are particularly thought-provoking.

The development types of the United States and Oman are vastly different, and their development levels are extremely disparate, but they share a common point: they value education. Under the rule of King Qaboos, Oman's educational landscape has undergone a dramatic transformation, from having only three primary schools and 909 students to owning 720 schools of various levels and more than 300,000 students! However, the Omani authorities do not rest on their laurels and are determined to eradicate illiteracy by the end of the century.

The universality and advancement of American education are widely recognized, but it does not stagnate. Instead, it keeps pace with the changing situation and practical needs, proposing an extremely bold plan to thoroughly reform education, the "2061 Plan," aiming to ensure that America's science and technology remain at the forefront of the world as it enters the 21st century.

Historical experience proves that education is the foundation of a nation. Currently, developing and reforming education has become a global trend. Valuing education provides the momentum for economic development and national prosperity. Conversely, it will inevitably lead to backwardness and decline. Any forward-looking nation should seize the opportunity, make far-sighted decisions for the development of education!

### 面向未来的《２０６１计划》

　　面向未来的《２０６１计划》
    本报记者  仓立德
    一股“振兴教育”的热潮正在美国兴起。
    目前，美国当局已将加强基础教育列为重点，初、高级教育机构普遍重视“对外开放”，博采众国之长。许多中、小学将外语、外国文化、世界历史和地理列为必修课。不少著名大学开始在世界各地训练学生。
    最令人注目的莫过于旨在改革整个初、中级教育体系的《２０６１计划》。这项规模空前，目标长远的计划一旦成功，不仅将使美国的基础教育发生根本变化，而且将给国民素质，社会经济、科技、文化诸方面带来难以估量的深远影响。
    危机从何而来
    美国一贯重视国民教育，是世界上最早实行义务教育法的国家。美国能够在独立后一个多世纪的时间里成为经济发达、科技先进的世界强国，教育的普及起了举足轻重的作用。
    强烈的教育危机感出现在５０年代。１９５７年１０月４日，苏联宣布在人类历史上首次成功发射了一颗人造卫星，消息传来，举国震惊。美国科学界一些权威人士对比了美苏的教育差距，认为“苏联十年制学校的学生所受的科学教育，尤其在数学方面，一般比美国的大学生还强；只有挽救教育才能挽救美国的后代，从而保证美国的未来”。美国当时采取的一个重大措施是，耗资上十亿美元，用数年时间重新改写了中、小学的数、理、化及其他科学课程的全部教科书。实践证明，此举有效地提高了教育质量。
    进入８０年代以来，人才荟萃、设备精良的各类教育机构遍布美国城乡，全国每年的公共、私人教育经费已高达约２千亿美元。尽管如此，许多有识之士仍痛感美国教育再度面临危机，较为普遍的看法是，一，美国在世界经济中的比重正在下降，美国工业品在国际市场上的竞争力已经减弱，美国在世界科技方面的领先地位受到挑战，重要原因之一是美国的教育质量已落在最强劲的经济竞争对手日本之后。二，美国中、小学生的科技基础薄弱，在国际科学知识竞赛中，美国学生成绩居于最差之列，在目前美国高等学府、科研机构中，攻读高级学位的外国留学生总数已超过本国学生；以当前美国劳动力的科技水准来看，已不能保证美国未来的工业进步。新任美国教育部长卡瓦佐斯说，美国现在实际面临三重赤字：贸易，预算和教育、“最后一个赤字也许是最为严重的”。三，世界科技发展日新月异、竞争激烈，又互相渗透、互相影响，为美国教育提出了更高要求。
    与此同时，探讨教育改革的专著纷纷出现，较重要的便有２０余种。这些专著从不同角度审视了美国教育的现状和缺陷，建议大刀阔斧改革教育体系，更好地适应以现代科技为基础的经济发展的需要。
    《２０６１计划》就是在这个背景下应运而生的。
    目标——２１世纪
    １９８５年，素享盛名的美国民间科学团体——美国促进科学协会，在全国科学技术教育委员会等机构和企业的资助下，延聘国内外科学、教育界约４００位科学家、教授、教师及一些科学、教育机构负责人，穷四年之功，共同起草并审定了《２０６１计划——全体美国人的科学》，其副题为：“关于科学、教学和技术知识目标的２０６１计划报告”。这项２００页的总体报告及其他５份专题报告，详细论述了全面改革美国初、中级教育体系的设想、步骤、目标及科学依据。
    计划认为，所有儿童都需要并且应该得到基本的科学（包括物理、化学、生物等自然科学及社会科学）、数学和技术教育，使他们生活得多姿多彩并富有成果；这种基本教育应当适应“科学知识和技术力量的急剧增长”。然而，目前大多数美国人在科学上茫然无知；美国学生在解决问题的能力上远逊于国际水平。１９８６年，１７岁学生的平均知识水准大大低于１９６９年；小学教师普遍未受过基础的科学、数学教育；科学知识教育方法还停留在１９世纪水平上；教材内容陈旧，课程繁冗，阻碍而不是促进学生掌握知识……因此，有必要根本改革教育思想、教科书、课程安排、教学指导乃至整个从幼儿园至高中教学体系，改革对象是现存的基础科学教育体制。
    按照《２０６１计划》的设想，这项改革将是一个长期而复杂的过程，共由３个阶段组成。第一阶段拟定计划，历时４年，已经完成。今年２月，在宣布计划的同时已转入第二阶段，目的是通过试点，为在全国推行教改提供一系列示范。主要内容有组织新课程、运用新教学方式，训练教师、实验新的教学器材和现代技术、探索新的教学方法，并为联邦政府和地方政府提出改革政策建议。另外，一个由２０名教师、３名校长和两名大学教育专家组成的小组已经成立。他们将在４年中每月抽出３至４天和两个夏季的时间致力于研究，总结各试点经验，结合改革实践编写准备全面推广的教材范本。
    １９９３年进入关键性的第三阶段。计划用１０年左右时间，通过各科学团体、教育组织和机构及其他有关部门的共同努力，将上阶段的试验成果转化为全国性教育实践，实现《２０６１计划》提出的最终目标。
    《２０６１计划》被美国舆论界称为“最雄心勃勃”的教育计划，在总体规模上将大大超过５０年代末期的那场教材改革。在解释计划名称的由来时，一位计划负责人说，充满宇宙天体奥秘的哈雷彗星上次掠过地球是在１９８５年，恰是开始制定计划的那一年；下次将是２０６１年，那时受惠于这项改革计划的美国后代将亲眼看到这颗美丽彗星的回归。
    改革传统教材和教学方式
    《２０６１计划》指出，教育的最高目的是使受教育者将来获得个人成功并承担起社会责任。因此，科学教育应当有助于培养学生解决实际问题的理解能力和思维习惯。美国的明天已比任何时候都更加依赖于儿童教育的性质和质量。
    改革的第一个重点是教材。计划认为，现在的课程内容“既庞杂又营养不良”。几十年来，这些课程无节制地扩展，使绝大部分教师和学生都背上一座又一座沉重的大山，但却难以把握科学、数学和技术的基本内涵。
    改革教材的前提是确定并精选恰当适用的教科书内容。为此，专家们根据当今世界科技发展的大趋势，经过长期、反复讨论取得一致意见，将每个学生在１３年教育中所应获得的基本科学知识浓缩为１２大类：科学、数学、技术的本质，属总论；后９类为自然界构成、生存环境、人体机能、人类社会、技术世界、数学世界、科学史观、共同主题和思维习惯。
    计划认为，沿袭至今的教学方法只强调学生掌握现成答案，而忽略了探讨问题；学生死记硬背那些零星片断知识，而不知其来龙去脉及相互联系。这种方法以背诵代替争论，以阅读代替动手，“不能鼓励学生相互合作，自由分享知识和思想，或用现代仪器来扩展其智能”。针对上述弊端，该计划总负责人卢瑟福表示，一要精减课程，二要培养学生开拓思想、手脑并用，增强思想和解决问题的能力。
    根据专家建议，学生从幼儿园至中学毕业只学十几门课程，每门课程综合自然科学、社会科学和数学知识，并有必要的技能训练。它自成体系，但不自我封闭，可容纳多种科目的知识。如在“进化”课中，学生不仅学生物进化过程，而且要了解政治制度的演变。这种授课方式的好处是，学生能够系统学习某一课程的基础知识，又可融汇贯通其他知识，有利于智能的全面发展；同时还可避免目前同一课程的无谓重复，或各门课程互相孤立的现象。
    目前，教材和教学方式的改革在美国才刚刚起步，许多方面还停留在设想或原则上，尽管如此，《２０６１计划》的基本思路及其为美国初、中级教育所描绘的蓝图仍值得重视。　
　　编后随感
    本专页今天发表三篇介绍美国、保加利亚、阿曼三国发展和改革教育的文章，其中美国和阿曼的两篇尤其发人深省。
    美国和阿曼的发展类型迥异，发展水平也悬殊极大，但它们有一个共同点：重视教育。阿曼在国王卡布斯的治理下，教育面貌发生了翻天覆地的变化，从只有三所小学、九百零九名学生发展到拥有各类各级学校七百二十所和学生三十多万！但是，阿曼当局并不就此“罢休”，决心到本世纪末扫除文盲。
    美国教育之普及和发达乃举世公认，但它并不固步自封，而是紧随形势之发展和现实的需要，提出一项极为大胆的对教育进行彻底改革的《二○六一计划》，力求确保美国的科技和经济进入二十一世纪时继续处于世界领先地位。
    历史经验证明，教育是立国之本。当前，发展和改革教育已成为世界性的潮流。重视教育，经济发展才有后劲，国家才能昌盛，反之，必然走向落后、衰败。任何一个面向未来的国家都应该审时度势，为发展教育作出具有远见的决策！
