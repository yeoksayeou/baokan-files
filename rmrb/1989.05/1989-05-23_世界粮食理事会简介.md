The World Food Council (WFC), established in 1974 following the recommendations of the World Food Conference and the decision of the United Nations General Assembly, is a functional body directly under the UN General Assembly. It consists of 36 member countries elected through a selection process. The headquarters is located in Rome, and the current Executive Director is Jot Jot.

The WFC's mission is to coordinate food-related policies within the UN system and report to the UN General Assembly through the Economic and Social Council. It holds annual meetings attended by ministerial-level representatives from member countries to discuss major reform issues in the international agricultural sector and to make recommendations to the UN General Assembly.

China has participated in the 6th and 7th sessions of the WFC as an observer. In 1982, China was elected as a member country. In May 1986, the WFC held a seminar on Asian and African food policies in China. In June 1987, the 13th ministerial-level meeting of the WFC was held in Beijing, where the "Beijing Declaration" was issued, calling for global attention to food issues.
