Go! Go! The women's judo 61kg final has reached a white-hot stage. Both the Chinese and Japanese cheerleaders are drumming to encourage their athletes. Chinese athlete Liu Guizhu and Japanese athlete Kobayashi Takako have been fighting on the tatami mat for 4 minutes, with neither side gaining the upper hand. The electronic scoreboard shows no points for either, and the display screen is blank. In judo, the entire match lasts 5 minutes. If neither scores, the referee decides the winner based on their impression. At this critical moment, both Chinese and Japanese coaches are shouting instructions to their athletes.

The Chinese coach yelled, "Liu Guizhu, be more aggressive, aim for results!" The shout reverberated through the arena. With only 1 minute left, the decisive moment had arrived. Liu Guizhu kicked her opponent a few times, but it had no effect. Kobayashi stood firmly on the tatami, unmoved. In a moment of desperation, Liu grabbed her opponent's hand, arched her back, and threw her to the ground. The match shifted from standing to grappling on the tatami. Liu Guizhu managed to pin Kobayashi, slightly gaining the upper hand. If she could keep her pinned, victory was within reach. However, the situation changed abruptly. Kobayashi's feet moved rapidly, like the blades of a propeller. She tried to use the force of her leg movements to break free from Liu's hold. This tactic worked, and Kobayashi turned the tables, escaping from under Liu and standing up again.

Time ticked away second by second. On the tatami, the two girls rolled around, but the electronic scoreboard showed no points. The coaches shouted themselves hoarse, but to no avail. Time was up, and neither had scored. The referee raised the flag to announce the result: victory went to the Japanese athlete Kobayashi. Although Liu lost, the difference between her and her opponent could not be measured in points. In other words, it was hard to tell who was superior on the mat. This was a truly evenly matched contest, a fierce and tenacious battle.

　　一场旗鼓相当的搏斗    
    ——记女子柔道６１公斤级决赛
    加油！加油！女子柔道６１公斤级决赛已经到了白热化程度，中日双方拉拉队都在为自己的选手擂鼓助威。中国的刘桂珠与日本的小林贵子在榻榻米上已激战４分钟，双方打得难分难解，不分胜负。电子记分牌上两人均未得分，显示屏幕没有分数显出。柔道比赛规定，全场比赛为５分钟，如双方都不得分由裁判根据印象判定胜负。此刻，中日教练都在喊自己队员做动作。
    中国队教练喊道：“刘桂珠主动些，要效果！”喊声震动全场。比赛只剩下１分钟，关键的时刻到了。刘桂珠踢了对手几脚，仍不见效，小林贵子站在榻榻米上纹丝不动。小刘急中生智拉住对手的手，弓身一背，把对手摔倒。比赛由站立转到相互在榻榻米上抱压。只见刘桂珠抱压住小林贵子，略占上风。如果能继续将其固定住，那么胜利在望。可是风云突变，小林贵子两脚飞速的摆动，犹如发动机的叶片。她试图以两脚摆动的力量来挣脱对手的抱压。这一招果然见效，小林贵子转危为安，从刘桂珠的身下翻身上来。
    时间一分一秒地过去，只见榻榻米上两名姑娘在滚动，电子记分牌却不见分数。教练喊哑了嗓子也无能为力。５分钟时间到了，双方均未得分，裁判举旗宣布结果，胜利的天平偏向日本姑娘小林贵子。刘桂珠虽然输了，但是她与对手的差距，已经不能用分数来计算，也就是说，场上难见高低了。这是一场真正的旗鼓相当的比赛，是一场勇敢顽强的搏斗。
