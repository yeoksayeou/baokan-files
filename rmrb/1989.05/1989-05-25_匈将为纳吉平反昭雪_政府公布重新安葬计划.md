Hungary to Rehabilitate and Honor Imre Nagy
Government Announces Reburial Plan

	NEW YORK, May 24 — Imre Nagy, who served as Prime Minister of Hungary during the 1956 uprising and was later executed, will soon be rehabilitated and given a public burial. The Hungarian government has announced plans for the reburial of Nagy and his co-defendants.

	The government newspaper "Magyar Hírlap" today published the details of the reburial ceremony for Nagy and his co-defendants.

	Nagy was elected Prime Minister of Hungary on October 24, 1956, and was executed by hanging on June 16, 1958, after the uprising was suppressed. In January of this year, the Hungarian government announced its decision to reburial the remains of Nagy and others.

	According to reports, the reburial ceremony for Nagy and his co-defendants will be held on June 16, the 31st anniversary of their execution.

	At 10:00 AM on that day, people will gather at Heroes' Square in the center of Budapest to lay wreaths for the deceased. Six coffins will be placed there. In addition to Nagy, the coffins will contain the remains of Pál Maléter, the Minister of Defense, József Szilágyi, the Secretary of State, Miklós Gimes, a journalist, and Géza Losonczy, the Minister of State, who died in prison before the trial. An empty coffin will symbolize the remains of the "nameless revolutionaries" who died in the Nagy case. Representatives who were sentenced in the Nagy case and are still alive will speak at the ceremony. At 12:30 PM, the nation will observe a moment of silence for the deceased, with church bells ringing simultaneously. Afterwards, the coffins will be transported from Heroes' Square to the cemetery. Only family members of the deceased and specially invited guests will be allowed to attend the burial ceremony at the cemetery.

	In recent days, several Hungarian party and government leaders have expressed the need to rehabilitate Nagy and his co-defendants. Speaker of the Parliament Mátyás Szűrös said in an interview, "It is necessary to rehabilitate Nagy and others legally and politically." In February, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party re-evaluated the events of October 1956, describing it as a "people's uprising."

　　匈将为纳吉平反昭雪
    政府公布重新安葬计划
    新华社布达佩斯５月２４日电  在匈牙利１９５６年事件时曾担任总理、后被处以极刑的纳吉·伊姆雷不久将平反昭雪，举行公葬。
    此间政府报纸《匈牙利新闻报》今天公布了纳吉及其同案人的重新安葬仪式计划。
    纳吉在１９５６年１０月２４日当选为匈牙利政府总理，事件平息后于１９５８年６月１６日被处以绞刑。今年１月，匈牙利政府宣布决定重新安葬纳吉等人遗骨。
    据报道，纳吉等人的重新安葬仪式将于６月１６日他们被处死３１周年纪念日那天举行。
    当天上午１０时，人们将在布达佩斯市中心的英雄广场向死者献花圈。那里届时停放６具灵柩。除纳吉外，还装有在同案中被处死的国防部长毛莱泰尔·帕尔、政府秘书长西拉吉·约瑟夫、新闻记者吉迈什·米克洛什以及在判决前就已死在狱中的国务部长洛松齐·盖佐的遗骨。另一具空棺则象征着装殓死去的“无名革命者”的遗骨。在纳吉案件中曾被判刑、现仍健在的代表将在仪式上发表讲话。中午１２时半，全国将为悼念死者默哀一分钟，同时教堂钟声齐鸣。尔后，灵柩将从英雄广场向墓地启运。只有死难者的家属和得到特别邀请的人方可到墓地参加下葬仪式。
    连日来，匈牙利一些党政领导人先后表示，应对纳吉及其同案人进行平反。国会主席絮勒什·马加什在一次谈话中说，“需要在法律上和政治上”为纳吉等人平反。今年２月，匈党中央重新评价了１９５６年１０月事件，认为这是一次“人民起义”。
