To ensure the smooth progress of economic reforms, the highest legislative body of Czechoslovakia has undertaken extensive legislative work. Last year, twenty laws were discussed and passed, and this year another twenty are to be reviewed, including laws on the national economic plan, foreign exchange, taxation, and the state bank, among others.

Indra, the chairman of the Federal Assembly, made these remarks on May 2 while briefing a visiting delegation from the Afghan National Assembly on Czechoslovakia's economic reforms.

Since the beginning of 1987, when Czechoslovakia promulgated the overall principles of economic reform, legislative work has been carried out for each reform measure. Important laws passed last year include the "State-Owned Enterprise Law," the "Agricultural Cooperative Law," and the "Production, Consumption, and Housing Cooperative Law." The Federal Assembly will soon review the "National Economic Plan Law," which the government has already discussed and approved.

The aforementioned approved laws have all come into effect. Various economic sectors are implementing reforms based on these laws. For example, the industrial sector is restructuring enterprises according to the new enterprise law, eliminating intermediate links, and establishing state-owned enterprises of various sizes that operate under a full-cost accounting system.

Currently, 1,550 state-owned enterprises have been established. The restructuring work will be completed by July 1 of this year.

　　为保障改革顺利进行    
    捷积极立法
    新华社布拉格五月二日电  捷克斯洛伐克联邦议会主席英德拉说，为保障经济改革顺利进行，捷最高立法机构进行了大量的立法工作。去年讨论和通过了二十项法律，今年又将审批二十项，其中包括国民经济计划、外汇、税收、国家银行等法律等等。
    英德拉是二日向正在这里访问的阿富汗国民议会代表团介绍捷经济改革情况时说这番话的。
    捷自一九八七年初颁布经济改革的总体原则后，对每项改革措施都进行了立法工作。去年通过的重要法律有《国营企业法》、《农业合作社法》、《生产、消费和住房合作社法》。联邦议会不久将审议的《国民经济计划法》，最近政府已讨论通过。
    上述批准的法律已全部生效。各经济部门根据这些法律实施改革。如工业部门按照新的企业法改组企业结构，取消中间环节，建立大小不同、实行完全核算制的国营企业。
    目前已建立一千五百五十个国营企业。改组工作将于今年七月一日完成。
