A new variety of rice with a relatively high protein content has recently been successfully bred by the Biology Department of Huazhong Normal University. Experts believe that if this variety is widely promoted, it could help address the current issue of insufficient protein intake among the Chinese population.

Since 1982, breeding experts Yang Xuehong and Fu Huihua from the Biology Department of Huazhong Normal University have used a certain chemical inducer to treat rice seeds, successfully breeding early-season and medium-season rice varieties that significantly extend the growth period. In recent years, through multi-point trials and selection, they have achieved success.

This rice variety has a protein content that is 52.1% higher than the 1,136 rice varieties currently promoted in China.

It is estimated that if each person consumes about half a kilogram of this polished rice per day, they can intake approximately 70 grams of protein.

　　高蛋白水稻新品系育成
    新华社武汉５月１０日电（记者熊金超）一种具有较高蛋白质含量的水稻新品系，最近由华中师范大学生物系培育成功。有关专家认为，如果大面积推广，可望解决目前中国人摄取蛋白质量偏低的难题。
    １９８２年以来，华中师范大学生物系杨学荣和扶惠华等育种专家通过使用某种化学诱剂处理稻种，育出了对拉开生育期有明显效应的早籼及中籼品系的稻种。近年来经多点试种和选育，获得成功。
    这种水稻比我国目前已测定过的１１３６个水稻推广良种的蛋白含量高５２．１％。
    据估计，若每人每天食用半公斤这种精米，可摄入约７０克蛋白质。
