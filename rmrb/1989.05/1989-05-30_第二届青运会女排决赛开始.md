The final of the women's volleyball competition at the Second National Youth Games began today in Shenyang. A total of eight teams are participating in the final. The host team, Liaoning, and Fujian directly advanced to the final, while Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, and the PLA team secured their spots by finishing in the top two in their respective preliminary rounds.

To adapt to the trend of volleyball moving towards a taller and more powerful style, this competition stipulates that each participating team must have at least three tall players (height above 1.80 meters), and the team on the court must have at least two tall players. Teams with fewer than two tall players on the court will have one point deducted per match. The results of the two matches held this afternoon are as follows: Liaoning and Beijing defeated Tianjin and Fujian with scores of 3:0 and 3:1, respectively.
