Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 19th.

The Communist Party Central Committee and the State Council held a meeting for Party, government, and military cadres in the capital tonight, calling on everyone to mobilize urgently and resolutely stop the turmoil that has occurred in the capital, quickly restoring normal order in all aspects.

The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the State, leaders of the Communist Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Central Military Commission, the Central Advisory Commission, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and the Beijing Municipal Party Committee attended the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Comrade Qiao Shi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party Central Committee.

Comrade Li Peng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, spoke on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party Central Committee. Comrade Yang Shangkun, Chairman of the State and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, also spoke. Comrade Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party Central Committee and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, first introduced the situation of the student movement in Beijing in recent periods and the serious impact it has had on various aspects of the city.

Comrade Li Peng said in his speech that the current situation in the capital is very serious, with an increasing trend towards anarchy, and the rule of law and discipline have been severely damaged. The situation in Beijing is still developing and has already spread to many cities across the country. Our country's reform and opening up, the Four Modernizations, the future and destiny of the People's Republic, are all facing serious threats.

He said that a very small number of people who deliberately create turmoil want to achieve their unconstitutional political goals of denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system under the conditions of turmoil, which cannot be achieved through normal democratic and legal channels.

Li Peng said that it must be emphasized that we must resolutely protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people and strictly distinguish them from the very few people who create turmoil. We will not pursue those who have made excessive remarks during the student movement.

He said that the dialogue between the Party and the government with the broad student body and people from all walks of life, including students who have participated in marches, demonstrations, class boycotts, and hunger strikes, will continue to be conducted extensively and actively through various levels, channels, and forms to fully listen to the opinions of all parties.

Li Peng said that for the reasonable demands raised by the students, we will give clear answers. For their reasonable criticisms and suggestions, we will seriously listen to and adopt them to improve the work of the Party and the government.

Li Peng hoped that the students who are on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square would immediately stop their hunger strike, leave the square, receive treatment, and quickly recover their health. He also hoped that the broad student body and people from all walks of life would immediately stop all march activities and, out of humanitarianism, no longer "support" the hunger-striking students. No matter what the motive, further "support" would push them to their doom.

Li Peng, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, called on the entire Party, the entire military, and people of all ethnic groups across the country to unite and work together, take immediate action, and contribute to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation at their respective posts.

Comrade Yang Shangkun also spoke at the meeting. He said, "I fully support the speech made by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee. Recently, the normal work order, production, and living order in Beijing have all been disrupted, and in many aspects, it has already been in a state of anarchy. In order to maintain social order in the capital and restore normal order, we had to bring in some units of the People's Liberation Army from outside the city. This is entirely to assist the capital's armed police and public security officers in performing their duties and is absolutely not directed at the students. I hope that all sectors of society and the broad masses of the people will fully understand and support this."

The speeches of Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun were warmly received with applause from the entire audience.

　　党中央国务院开党政军干部大会    
    李鹏杨尚昆先后发表讲话    
    号召紧急动员迅速恢复首都正常秩序
    新华社北京５月１９日电  中共中央、国务院今天晚上召开中央和北京市党政军干部大会，号召大家紧急动员起来，坚决制止在首都已经发生的动乱，迅速恢复各方面的正常秩序。
    国家主席、副主席，中共中央、国务院、全国人大常委会、中央军委、中顾委、中纪委、全国政协和北京市的领导同志出席了大会。
    大会由中共中央政治局常委乔石主持。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏代表中共中央政治局常委会在会上讲话。国家主席、中央军委副主席杨尚昆也讲了话。中共中央政治局委员、中共北京市委书记李锡铭在会上首先介绍了最近一个时期北京市学潮的发生和发展的情况，说明了已经出现的动乱对北京市各方面所产生的严重影响。
    李鹏同志在讲话中说，当前首都形势相当严峻，无政府状态越来越严重，法制和纪律遭到破坏。北京的事态还在发展，而且已经波及到了全国许多城市。我们国家的改革开放和四化建设，人民共和国的前途和命运，已经面临严重的威胁。
    他说，蓄意制造动乱的极少数极少数人，就是要在动乱的条件下达到他们通过正常民主与法制渠道不可能达到的否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度的违反宪法的政治目的。
    李鹏说，必须强调，要坚决保护广大青年爱国热情，把他们同制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来，对他们在学潮中的过激言行不予追究。
    他说，党和政府同广大学生和各界人士之间的对话，包括同参加过游行、示威、罢课、绝食的学生之间的对话，还将通过多种层次、多种渠道和多种形式广泛积极地进行，以充分听取各方面的意见。
    李鹏说，对学生们提出的合理要求，我们将给予明确的答复，对他们的合理批评和建议，为惩治官倒、消除腐败、克服官僚主义，我们将认真听取和采纳，以切实改进党和政府的工作。
    李鹏在讲话中希望在天安门广场绝食的学生立即停止绝食、离开广场，接受治疗，尽快恢复健康；希望广大同学和社会各界立即停止一切游行活动，并从人道主义出发，再也不要对绝食学生进行所谓的“声援”了。不管动机如何，再搞“声援”，就是把他们推向绝路。
    李鹏代表党中央和国务院号召全党全军全国各族人民，和衷共济，团结一致，立即行动起来，在各自的岗位上为制止动乱和稳定局势作出贡献。
    杨尚昆同志在会上讲了话。他说，我完全拥护李鹏同志代表中央政治局常委会所作的讲话。最近，北京的正常工作秩序，生产、生活秩序，都发生了混乱，实质上在许多方面已处于无政府状态。为了维护首都社会治安，恢复正常秩序，我们不得已，从外地调来了一部分人民解放军部队。这完全是为了协助首都武警、公安干警执行任务，绝对不是针对学生的。希望社会各界和广大人民群众，对此给予充分的理解和支持。
    李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的讲话受到全场热烈鼓掌的欢迎。
