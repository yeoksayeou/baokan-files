The village of Yaodibottom in Yangping Town, Baoji County, Shaanxi Province, has a popular saying: "Ten large rooms were taken for free, eight people worked without pay, cars were driven into scrap, and motorcycles and TVs were taken home; the 'monks' got rich, the 'temple' got poor, and the village lost 30,000 yuan."

Investigating the matter, it was found that this folk song criticizes the village-run Huasheng Commercial Company, which is operated under a contract system by an individual. The company was established in early 1983. Although it was supposed to be a commercial and industrial enterprise, it actually focused solely on commerce. The village provided more than ten business-use rooms. To support the company's operations, the village committee invested nearly 40,000 yuan and spent 25,426 yuan to purchase a multi-purpose vehicle for the company to use without charge. The company is located at a bustling intersection on the Yangping section of the Longhai Railway between Xi'an and Baoji, making it an ideal place for doing business and making money.

According to informed sources, when Huasheng Company was being planned, the village party secretary, Jia Xianmao, nominated Mou Zhongxiao to be the manager and implement a contract management system for five years. Villagers commented that the first two years were tolerable, but later it became increasingly unacceptable, and the contractor became greedy. Statistics show that during the five years of Mou Zhongxiao's contract management, the company, including bank loans and village funds, invested a total of 180,000 yuan. However, by February 1, 1988, when the new manager, Zhang Youxian, took over, the inventory value of goods was only 110,000 yuan, including 100,000 yuan worth of goods that had gone moldy and spoiled. Before the original manager stepped down, eight business staff had not received a single yuan in wages for thirteen consecutive months. The multi-purpose vehicle provided by the village without charge was also driven into scrap and sold for 2,300 yuan. During the five years of Mou Zhongxiao's contract management, the total amount paid to the village was only 24,738 yuan, which was not enough to cover the initial cost of purchasing the vehicle.

"Huasheng" is not prosperous, the "company" is not fair, management is chaotic, and there are serious losses. Now, it has become a true "poor temple," but the "monks" in the temple are very rich. The original contractor, Mou Zhongxiao, and his brother originally had only three brick houses and one cave dwelling. Now, a small villa has been built. The reporter witnessed on the spot that the villa is decorated with "mosaic" tiles, and the walls are shining. The owner's small family factory on the second floor is also doing good business. The village secretary, Jia Xianmao's "small villa," was also completed last year. More surprisingly, during Mou Zhongxiao's tenure as manager, the issue of illegally transferring a copy of the business license and a set of five-copy delivery notes with a tax stamp has not been properly investigated and punished to this day, and the 2,000 yuan transfer fee is also unknown. The color TV and imported motorcycles of Huasheng Company were also taken as private property by Mou Zhongxiao, and no one in the village committee dared to ask or manage.

The state loaned 147,700 yuan, the village invested nearly 40,000 yuan, more than ten business-use rooms were occupied for free for five years, and the amount paid was only enough to cover the cost of buying the vehicle. The villagers of Yaodibottom did not benefit at all, the collective gained nothing, and they were left with a heavy burden. No wonder many villagers ask: For whom is the village running the enterprise?

The more the reporter investigated, the deeper the impression. This phenomenon of the "monks" getting rich while the "temple" gets poor goes against the original intention of developing township enterprises and harms the interests of the majority of farmers. It is reported that the phenomenon of "poor temple, rich monks" in Baoji County and even in Shaanxi Province is not an isolated case and is worth studying by relevant departments and leaders.

　　穷“庙”富“和尚”    
    ——陕西宝鸡窑底村华盛公司承包经营纪实
    景险峰　韩启明
    陕西省宝鸡县阳平镇窑底村流传这样一段顺口溜：“十几间大房被白占，八个人干活没工钱，汽车跑成了破铁片，摩托彩电往自家端；富了‘和尚’穷了‘庙’，村上倒亏了三万元”。
    打探究竟，方知这段民谣抨击的是本村由个人承包经营的华盛工商业公司。这个村办公司成立于一九八三年初。名为工商兼营，实则单纯经商。十几间营业性用房，全由村里提供。为扶持公司开拓经营门路，村委会先后投资了近四万元，还花二万五千四百二十六元购买了一辆客货两用汽车，归该公司无偿使用。公司地处陇海线西安至宝鸡段阳平镇繁华的十字路口，是个经商赚钱的好去处。
    据知情者介绍，早在华盛公司酝酿成立之时，村党支部书记贾贤茂就提名牟忠孝担任经理，实行承包经营，一包五年。村民们评论说，开始两年还差不多，到后来越来越不像话，承包者心贼了。统计数字表明，在牟忠孝承包经营的五年间，该公司包括银行贷款和村里垫资，总共投入十八万多元。而到一九八八年二月一日，由新任经理张有贤接替承包经营时，库存商品价值仅为十一万余元，其中有一点一万余元的商品发霉变质。原经理卸任前，八名营业人员连续十三个月未发一分钱的工资。村上无偿提供的那辆客货两用新汽车，也被折腾成了破铁片，仅以二千三百元拍卖处理。牟忠孝五年承包期间，给村里的上交款累计只有二万四千七百三十八元，还抵不住当初购买汽车的款子。
    “华盛”不盛，“公司”不公，管理混乱，严重亏损。如今，它变成了名副其实的“穷庙”，但庙里的当家“和尚”却很富有。原承包人牟忠孝兄弟两人，原来只有三间瓦房一孔窑。如今“小洋楼”拔地而起。记者现场目击，此楼内外用“马赛克”贴面，四壁生辉。主人在楼上办的家庭小工厂，生意也颇红火。村支书贾贤茂的“小洋楼”，也于去年突击落成。更令人吃惊的是，牟忠孝任经理期间，非法转让营业执照副本和盖有税章的一本五联式发货票的问题，迄今没有受到应有的追究和惩处，所得的二千元转让费也不知去向。华盛公司的彩电和进口摩托车等，也被牟忠孝占为私有，村委会没人敢问敢管。
    国家贷款十四点七七万元、村上投资近四万元，十几间营业房白白被占用了五年之久，上交款只抵个买汽车钱，窑底村群众未得任何实惠，集体一无所获，还背了一个沉重的包袱。难怪许多村民质问：村里办企业到底为谁在办？
    记者越调查感触越深。这种富了“和尚”穷了“庙”的现象，违背了发展乡镇企业的初衷，损害了大多数农民的利益。据悉，“穷庙富和尚”在宝鸡县以至陕西省并非个别现象，很值得有关部门和领导研究。
