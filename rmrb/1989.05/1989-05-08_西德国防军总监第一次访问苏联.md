West German Defense Chief's First Visit to the Soviet Union

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 6 - (Reporter Sheng Shiliang) The results of the four-day visit by the Chief of the West German Armed Forces, Wellerhoff, to the Soviet Union indicate that the two countries' militaries have increased their understanding, but there are still differences on issues such as nuclear disarmament and European security.

	The formal visit by the Chief of the West German Armed Forces to the Soviet Union is the first contact between the two countries' military delegations, and thus has attracted much attention.

	Yesterday, Wellerhoff said at a press conference that he does not believe a nuclear-free world can be established before the year 2000. Nuclear weapons are still a deterrent factor at present. The elimination of nuclear weapons is a distant goal, and at present, only the reduction of nuclear armaments can be discussed. He advocates starting talks on reducing European tactical nuclear weapons at an appropriate time. He welcomed the Soviet Union's unilateral disarmament but believed that after this process is completed, the Warsaw Pact still holds a military advantage in Europe.

	Yesterday, Soviet Defense Minister Yazov received Wellerhoff.

　　西德国防军总监第一次访问苏联
    据新华社莫斯科５月６日电  （记者盛世良）联邦德国国防军总监韦勒斯霍夫对苏联为期４天的访问结果表明，两国军方增进了了解，但在核裁军和欧洲安全等问题上尚有分歧。
    联邦德国国防军总监对苏联进行的这次正式访问是两国军事代表团的首次接触，因而颇引人注意。
    韦勒斯霍夫昨天在记者招待会上指出，他不相信２０００年前能建立无核世界，核武器当前仍是威慑因素。消除核武器是遥远的事，现在只谈得上降低核军备水平。他主张在适当的时候开始就削减欧洲战术核武器问题进行会谈。他对苏联单方面裁军表示欢迎，但认为在这一过程完成后，华约在欧洲仍占军事优势。
