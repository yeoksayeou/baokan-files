The 14 male and female athletes of the Chinese Taipei judo team won 5 bronze medals at the Sixth Pan-Pacific Judo Championships, making both the coaches and the athletes very excited. The reporter interviewed Wu Zhongchuan, the coach of the Chinese Taipei team, at the Yuantan Sports Hall.

Wu Zhongchuan lives in Chiayi and teaches at an elementary school there. In his spare time, he coaches at the Puzi Judo Club, where he has over 100 students. Four of the athletes who participated in this competition are his disciples. Wu Zhongchuan said that the Taipei team was hastily selected and formed before the competition. Due to the short preparation time, they did not have enough time to train in Taiwan after the team was formed and only trained for two days after arriving in Beijing.

Wu Zhongchuan introduced the development of judo in Taiwan. He said that Taiwan places great importance on judo, with many participants, especially among middle school students who love this sport. They train in their spare time every day. After school, students go to their respective judo clubs to practice from 5 PM to 7 PM. They first learn protective techniques, such as forward protective falls, backward protective falls, and left and right protective falls. Then they learn offensive techniques, such as shoulder throws, major inner reaps, and major outer reaps, among others. The focus of offensive techniques is to cultivate flexibility and variability, rather than a single technique. Wu Zhongchuan admitted that judo in Taiwan is not as strong as on the mainland, mainly because the athletes have less training time and are not willing to endure hardships. He expressed his desire to exchange skills with mainland athletes in the future, including coming to the mainland to learn.

Wu Zhongchuan believes that judo is a sport that strengthens the body. When he was in middle school, he studied under the famous Taiwanese judo master Chen Shuyin and learned a lot. He likes riding motorcycles, and once when he had an accident and hit a tree, he quickly used judo protective techniques to roll forward, narrowly avoiding a major disaster. Later, he had a few more accidents, all of which he escaped using judo protective techniques.

Wu Zhongchuan mentioned that judo training should start from a young age to cultivate interest. Many of the athletes who came to compete this time are high school students, some in their second year and some in their third year.

At the end of the interview, Coach Wu Zhongchuan shared his feelings about participating in the competition on the mainland, saying that he felt warm, convenient, and smooth this time.

　　台湾青年喜爱柔道运动   
    ——访中国台北队教练吴中川
    本报记者  黄振中
    中国台北柔道队１４名男女选手在第六届泛太平洋柔道锦标赛中取得５枚铜牌的好成绩，教练和队员都很兴奋。记者在月坛体育馆采访了中国台北队教练吴中川。
    吴中川家住嘉义，在本地教小学，业余时间到朴子柔道社执教，其弟子有１００多人，这次参赛的台北队有４名队员是他培养的。吴中川说，台北队是赛前临时选拔组建的。由于组队时间短，集中后在台湾未来得及训练，到了北京才训练了两天。
    吴中川介绍了台湾柔道运动开展情况。他说，台湾比较重视柔道运动，参加的人多，尤其是中学生更喜爱这项运动。他们是每天利用业余时间训练，学生放了学后到各自参加的柔道社团练习，从５点钟练到７点钟，先学护身法，如前护身倒法、后护身倒法、还有左右护身法等。然后再学进攻招术，有过肩摔，大内勾、大外勾等等。进攻招术主要是培养灵活多变，而不是单一技术。吴中川承认台湾柔道不如大陆，主要是队员训练时间少，同时又不能吃苦。他表示今后要多与大陆选手交流技艺，包括来大陆学习。
    吴中川认为，柔道运动是一项锻炼体魄的健身运动。他在读中学时，曾拜台湾柔道名家陈戍寅为师，学到不少本领。他喜欢骑摩托，一次开车不小心撞到树上，他急中生智，利用柔道护身法向前滚，结果幸免一场大祸。以后还有几次事故，都是因为用柔道护身法躲过灾难。
    吴中川谈到：进行柔道训练，主要是从小抓起，培养兴趣。这次来参赛的队员不少是高中生，有的上二年级，有的上三年级。
    在结束采访时，吴中川教练谈了自己到大陆参赛的感受，认为这次来比赛感到亲切、方便、顺利。
