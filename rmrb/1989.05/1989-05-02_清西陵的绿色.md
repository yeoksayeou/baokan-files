The majestic mountains, the secluded valleys, the gurgling springs, and the babbling streams make the natural scenery of the Western Qing Tombs enchanting. The golden roofs, red walls, red gates, jade arches, arched bridges, spirit paths, steles, and pavements, along with the palaces and towers, showcase the ingenious architectural artistry of the Western Qing Tombs. However, what captivates visitors and makes them linger is the lush green forest of the Western Qing Tombs.

If the vast architectural complex of the Western Qing Tombs is considered a national treasure among relics, then the elegant ancient pine forest is a gem. The Western Qing Tombs currently have over 25,000 ancient pines, densely covering the imperial and empress tombs' spirit paths on both sides, the walls surrounding the concubines' gardens, and extending to the end of the valleys. From a high vantage point, the green expanse seems endless.

The Qing dynasty emperors particularly valued the greening and beautification of their imperial tombs. These towering ancient pines, some planted in rows, others in clusters, some straight, others twisted, with their bark in various patterns, exhibit a thousand different postures. Their branches intertwine, creating a lively and charming scene. No wonder someone described the Western Qing Tombs as a green poem, a green painting, a green ocean.

In the palace city of Yongzheng Emperor's Tai Mausoleum, there is an ancient pine tree known as the "Sleeping Dragon Pine." Its trunk soars straight up, with its twisted branches stretching out horizontally, almost reaching the top of the treasure city, resembling a dragon ready to leap, symbolizing the emperor's eternal reign. Near Jiaqing Emperor's Chang Mausoleum, there are the "Longevity Pine" and the "Bodhisattva Pine," which remain green even in frost, with their branches spreading out, symbolizing the longevity of the Qing dynasty and the protection of the Buddha over the emperor and empress. In front of the Dragon and Phoenix Gate of Daoguang Emperor's Mu Mausoleum, there is the "Greeting Pine," with its branches spread out like a graceful lady holding a flower, welcoming visitors to the mausoleum. Inside the three gates of Guangxu Emperor's Chong Mausoleum, there are nine "Luohan Pines" with iron-like bark, planted in a row, symbolizing the "Eighteen Luohans standing guard over the imperial tomb."

The ancient pines of the Western Qing Tombs have an average age of over 500 years, most of which were transplanted from the Taihang Mountains after the construction of the imperial tombs. In the present-day Shanglaofang Village of Shangzhuang Township, Laishui County, Hebei Province, there were once countless green pines. Trees were transported from there to the Western Qing Tombs, with four large horses carrying one tree each, following the Jiuma River, passing through the Zijing Pass, descending the Eighteen Bends, and walking along the Yishui River. Along the way, local residents helped with the transportation. At that time, the pine trees transported from Laishui to the Western Qing Tombs were guarded by the Eight Banner soldiers. Upon entering the tomb area, the horses did not remove their bells, and the people did not dismount, as this was a special imperial decree for those who contributed to the greening efforts.

The trees planted in the Tai Mausoleum of Yongzheng, the Chang Mausoleum of Jiaqing, and the Mu Mausoleum of Daoguang were all managed by the wood workshops from Beijing, Jinan, and Baoding, which were responsible for building the imperial tombs. The trees survived, and the tombs were completed without any issues. However, the construction contract for Guangxu's Chong Mausoleum did not include greening, so there were no trees when the mausoleum was completed.

Later, Liang Dingfen, a Qing dynasty official in charge of guarding the tombs, came up with a way to raise funds. He collected some small bottles, filled them with snow from the top of Chong Mausoleum, and labeled them "Chong Mausoleum Snow Water." He then brought these bottles to the residences of Qing dynasty nobles and officials, explaining that Chong Mausoleum urgently needed greening but lacked funds, and requested donations to purchase saplings. Using this method, he raised over 2,000 taels of silver, finally greening Chong Mausoleum. The eighteen Luohan Pines were personally planted by Liang Dingfen.

According to records, the Western Qing Tombs originally had over 200,000 pine trees, with each mausoleum having professional tree caretakers responsible for pest control, watering, and weeding.

By 1915, due to public and private logging, the greening of the Western Qing Tombs was significantly damaged. Later, the indiscriminate logging by the Nationalist Army and the invading Japanese Army further reduced the number of ancient pines by tens of thousands. After the victory against Japan, the Japanese military leaders, who were imprisoned in the Zhencui Garden, planted many trees in the area around Guangxu's Chong Mausoleum as part of their redemption efforts. In recent years, some of the surviving tree planters revisited the site, touching the trees they planted, and were filled with emotions.

After liberation, the government paid great attention to the protection of cultural relics and greening efforts in the tomb area. Over the past 40 years, tens of thousands of young pines have been planted in the ancient pine forest each year.

Today, the Western Qing Tombs are adorned with ancient pines in full vigor and young trees growing vigorously. The green surroundings complement the golden and resplendent ancient architectural complex, making this "land of concentrated beauty" even more captivating.

### 清西陵的绿色

　　清西陵的绿色
    曹治淮
    巍巍山势，幽幽沟谷，汩汩清泉，潺潺山溪，清西陵的自然风光是迷人的。
    金顶朱墙，朱门玉坊，拱桥神道，碑亭海墁，宫殿明楼，清西陵的建筑艺术巧夺天工。然而，使游人流连忘返的还有清西陵郁郁葱葱的林海。
    如果说，清西陵庞大的建筑群是文物中的国粹；那么，清西陵秀颀的古松林则堪称瑰宝。清西陵现有古松两万五千余株，密布在帝后陵寝神道两旁，嫔妃园寝围墙四周，一直延伸到山谷尽头，登高眺望，绿色无边。
    清代帝王特别重视皇陵的绿化和美化。这些参天入云的古松，有的行栽，有的海植，有的笔直，有的虬曲，鳞片斑驳，千姿百态，枝干缠连，左右交错，情趣盎然。难怪有人形容说，清西陵如同一首绿色的诗，一幅绿色的画，一片绿色的海洋。
    雍正皇帝的泰陵方城内，有老态龙钟的“卧龙松”，躯干扶摇直上，虬枝凌空横飞，宝城垛口，“龙头”吻及宝顶，恰似一条跃跃欲起的巨龙，寓意皇帝大业万古长青。嘉庆皇帝的昌陵附近，有凌霜更绿的“寿星松”和枝叶纷披的“菩萨松”，封建统治者又借此象征“大清王朝岁远天长”，“帝后寿终正寝仍有佛主保佑”。道光皇帝的慕陵龙凤门前，有枝条舒展的“迎客松”，好像亭亭玉立的簪花仕女，伸臂笑迎前来谒陵的人。光绪皇帝的崇陵三座门内，各有九株铁皮直干、并排而植的“罗汉松”，说是“十八罗汉在恭立卫守皇陵”。
    清西陵的古松，平均树龄在五百年以上，大多是皇陵建成后，从太行山里移植来的成材大树。现在的河北省涞源县上庄乡上老芳村一带，当时青松满山，成千上万，从那里往清西陵刨运树株，四匹大马驮载一棵，沿拒马河，过紫荆关，下十八盘，走易水岸，沿途百姓夹道帮行。那时从涞源运往清西陵的松树，有八旗兵护守，进入陵区，马不摘铃，人不下跪，这是清帝王对绿化有功的人下的特别旨令。
    雍正泰陵、嘉庆昌陵、道光慕陵所植树木，均由北京、济南、保定承包建筑皇陵的木厂公柜负责植造，陵成树活，竣工验收，毫不含糊。唯独光绪崇陵的承包建筑合同上没写绿化，因此崇陵交工后无树。
    后来，守陵的清朝遗老梁鼎芬想出个摊派的补救办法，他收集部分小瓶，上崇陵宝顶一一装满积雪，瓶上贴有标签：崇陵雪水。将此带回北京，到清朝亲贵官邸，遗臣府上，挨门拜送，说明崇陵急需绿化，就是缺少资金，请求赞助集资，购买树苗。他用此法，筹得白银两千多两，终于绿化了崇陵，那十八棵罗汉松，就是梁鼎芬亲手栽植的。
    据资料记载，当时清西陵共有松树２０万余株，各陵都设有专业树户，除虫浇水拔草，精心管理。
    到１９１５年，由于公卖私伐，使清西陵的绿化遭到一定程度的破坏，加上后来国民党军队和侵华日军的肆意滥砍，使清西陵的古松减少十几万株。抗日胜利后，侵略华北的日军头目，被我方关押在珍妃园寝内，他们立功赎罪，在光绪崇陵一带，栽活了不少树木。前些年这批植树人中的健在者，旧地重游，手扶他们种下的树，感慨万千。
    解放以后，政府十分重视陵区的文物保护和绿化工作，４０年来，在古松林里连年栽植幼松，多达３０万株。
    如今的清西陵，古松青春焕发，新树蓬勃成长，绿色掩映着金碧辉煌的皇陵古建筑群，使这块“乾坤聚秀”的胜地，更加令人心往神驰。
