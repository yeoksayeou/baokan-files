	Henan Summer Grain Procurement Funds Misappropriated Again, Issuing White Receipts to Farmers Inevitable

	Xinhua News Agency reporters Lu Xinyun and People's Daily reporter Li Erliang report from Zhengzhou: Since April, the People's Bank and the Agricultural Bank in Zhoukou and Pingdingshan regions of Henan have conducted investigations and surveys on the use of agricultural and sideline product procurement funds in various counties and districts. They discovered that some counties' grain, tobacco, cotton, and hemp departments have misappropriated large amounts of agricultural and sideline product procurement funds for building houses and factories, purchasing cars, doing business, and covering enterprise losses, severely affecting the return of agricultural procurement funds and exacerbating the tight summer harvest funds situation.

	According to the investigation, the agricultural loan funds in Zhoukou and Pingdingshan regions were in an unusually tight state in the first quarter of this year. One of the main reasons is the serious misappropriation of agricultural procurement funds by some departments. The investigation results of Pingdingshan Agricultural Bank show that the city has misappropriated and occupied 120 million yuan of agricultural procurement funds, and delayed 140 million yuan of agricultural procurement loan funds. In Huaiyang County, Zhoukou Region, the agricultural loan fund balance at the end of the first quarter was 49.55 million yuan, while the grain and oil storage was only 21.01 million yuan, with more than 42% of the agricultural procurement funds being misappropriated for other uses.

	The supply and marketing cooperatives and tobacco systems also have serious misappropriation of agricultural procurement funds. Huaiyang County's Xinzhuan Supply and Marketing Cooperative misappropriated 10.3 million yuan out of 20.7 million yuan of cotton procurement funds in the first quarter to build a leather factory and an oil mill; Baofeng and Lushan counties' tobacco and grain systems transferred a large amount of agricultural procurement funds to labor service companies, used to operate guesthouses, and engage in household appliances, general merchandise, tobacco, alcohol, and negotiated grain and oil, making 22.8 million yuan of agricultural procurement funds unable to return.

	A relevant responsible person from the People's Bank of China, Henan Branch, pointed out that currently, the phenomenon of misappropriation of agricultural loan funds by units that control agricultural loan funds is very common, and the amount is huge. He hopes that relevant parties will take decisive measures to resolutely recover the misappropriated agricultural procurement funds. Otherwise, the imminent summer grain procurement will inevitably issue white receipts again.

　　河南夏粮收购资金又被挪用  向农民打白条现象难免再现
    本报郑州５月１０日电  农民日报记者鲁心云、本报记者李而亮报道：４月份以来，河南周口地区和平顶山市的人民银行和农业银行对所属各县、区农副产品采购资金使用情况调查摸底时发现，一些县的粮食、烟草、棉麻等部门大量挪用农副产品采购资金来盖房建厂、购买汽车、做买卖、弥补企业亏损等，严重影响农采资金归位，加剧了今年夏收资金紧张的状况。
    据调查，周口、平顶山两地市今年第一季度农贷资金一直处于超常紧张状态，重要原因就是一些部门挪用农业采购资金的情况严重。平顶山市农行的调查结果表明，全市挪用挤占农采资金达１．２亿元，拖欠农采资金贷款１．４亿元。周口地区淮阳县粮食系统第一季度末农贷资金余额４９５５万元，而粮油库存仅存２１０１万元，其中４２％以上的农采资金被挪作它用。
    供销社、烟草系统挪用农采资金的情况也很严重。淮阳县新站供销社第一季度将２０７万元棉花收购款挪走了１０３万元用于建皮革厂和油厂；宝丰、鲁山两县的烟草、粮食系统把大量农采资金转移到劳动服务公司，用作办招待所，经营家用电器、百货、烟酒、议价粮油等，使２２８万元农采资金不能归位。
    中国人民银行河南省分行有关负责人指出，目前一些掌握农贷资金的单位挤占挪用农采资金现象非常普遍，而且数额巨大。他希望有关方面采取坚决措施果断地回收被挪用的农采资金。否则，马上将至的夏粮收购势必再打白条。
