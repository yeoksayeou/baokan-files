Today, the Tianjin Municipal Government held a meeting on ensuring the current people's livelihood. It was revealed that the current industrial and agricultural production and market supply in Tianjin are good, and the operation of power generation and public utilities is normal. Mayor Li Ruihuan pointed out: This is the result of the joint efforts of the broad masses, including young students, and the day-and-night work of various departments. We must avoid mistakes and maintain the normal life of the people, which will gradually improve.

Over the past month, Tianjin has faced unprecedented challenges due to the student movement since the founding of the nation. However, due to the efforts of all parties and the work foundation laid over the past few years, Tianjin has not encountered major difficulties. In April, the pure purchase and pure sales of the commercial sector increased by 20.3% and 13.6% respectively compared to the same period last year, and the social retail sales of commodities increased by 14.6%. The supply of meat, eggs, vegetables, and aquatic products is good, and the price of vegetables is stable and slightly decreasing. The stock of grains, oil, salt, soap, matches, and lye is sufficient, and the supply is abundant. The supply of tap water, coal, gas, and electricity is guaranteed. The public transportation vehicle operation rate reaches 96%, and the operation resumes to normal immediately after the parade passes, with no traffic accidents or service incidents. In ensuring effective supply, various bureaus and commissions work diligently to prioritize tasks. The power supply focuses on ensuring large colleges and universities, government agencies, grain departments, residents, agriculture, and 19 sensitive products.
