Japanese opposition parties submit no-confidence motion
Demand speaker of the House of Representatives resign immediately

New China News Agency, Tokyo, May 25th – The Japanese Socialist, Komeito, and Democratic Socialist parties jointly submitted a no-confidence motion against the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Haruo Araki, this afternoon, demanding his immediate resignation.

Almost a month ago, the Speaker, in collusion with the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, convened a formal session of the House of Representatives, allowing the Liberal Democratic Party to pass the budget for this fiscal year solely based on its majority seats. This budget had been held hostage by the opposition parties, who demanded that the government clarify its involvement in the Recruit scandal and its relationship with multiple high-ranking officials. Therefore, the passage of this budget greatly infuriated the opposition parties.

Today, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, relying on its majority seats in the National Diet, unilaterally decided to extend the current session of the Diet by 25 days to discuss political reform bills aimed at restoring the image of the Liberal Democratic Party.

The current session of the Diet was originally scheduled to end on May 28th.

　　日在野党提出不信任案
    要求众院议长尽快辞职
    新华社东京５月２５日电  日本社会、公明、民社３个在野党，今天下午联合向国会提出对众议院议长原健三郎的不信任案，要求他尽快辞职。
    近一个月前，这位议长配合执政的自民党召开众议院正式会议，使自民党单独依靠多数议席通过了本年度预算案。这一预算案曾是在野党要挟政府搞清利库路特贿赂案同政府和执政党多名要人关系的“人质”。因此，它被众议院通过一事大大激怒了在野党。
    日本执政的自民党今天还依仗其在国会的多数席位，单独决定将本届国会例会延长２５天，以便讨论旨在恢复自民党形象的政治改革法案等问题。
    本届国会例会原定到本月２８日结束。
