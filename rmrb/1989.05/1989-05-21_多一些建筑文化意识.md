Over the past few years, many buildings have been constructed, and a lot of money has been spent. However, people's dissatisfaction with architecture has grown along with the increasing number of buildings. This article will not delve into specific issues such as unfair distribution or inadequate facilities. In terms of the overall image of architecture, there are few buildings that are pleasing to the eye. Some have even added difficulties to the renovation and development of cities and towns, or have damaged precious architectural cultural heritage.

Architecture is often referred to as a monument to human culture. What kind of monument do we want to leave for future generations? The more buildings we construct, the more our shortcomings in architecture are exposed. The fatal flaw is not a lack of money; cultural poverty is more frightening. When we expend enormous resources and effort, only to create obstacles for the future development of cities and towns, are we contributing positively or negatively? At a time when the country is reducing the scale of construction projects, from decision-makers, designers, and construction workers to ordinary citizens, everyone needs to take a step back and think about the issue of architectural culture.

Due to historical reasons, China has long regarded applied sciences and technologies as "frivolous and ingenious tricks," and architects as mere craftsmen. It was only in the 1920s of this century that formally trained architects began to emerge. However, in broader social circles, architecture is still not seen as a form of culture; it is merely considered "building houses." Under this architectural mindset, the construction industry in China has yet to become a pillar of the national economy.

Looking back at the nearly 9,000-year history of human architecture, architectural concepts have generally gone through five stages: Initially, architecture was seen as a means of survival, providing shelter from the elements and protecting against wild animals. This was the practical architecture stage, where people lived in caves and built shelters from wood. Later, architecture was revered as the mother of art, treated as a pure art form like painting and sculpture, with the saying "architecture is frozen music." In the industrialized society, architecture was viewed as a large industrial product, a "machine for living," known as the functionalist stage of architecture. Some people believe that "space is the protagonist of architecture," entering the stage of architecture as spatial art. Now, more and more people recognize that architecture is a science and art for expanding human living space, proposing the stage of environmental architecture. This is a new milestone in architectural thought.

For the development of China's architectural industry and for better survival, we must deeply understand the essential characteristics of architectural culture. It is an "environmental culture" and "background culture." The environment is like a "cage" for humans, nature, and society, and architectural culture is the "cage culture" designed and constructed for human survival and development—designing and building residences, residential areas, cities, and conducting regional planning and land management, all of which require a cultural perspective to observe the whole, formulate plans, and guide practice. It is important to understand that architectural culture is reflected not only in material aspects but also in spiritual aspects. As an environment, it serves the present, has historical continuity, and defines the future, directly influencing people's psychology and physiology. It plays an active role in spreading new material civilization and new ways of life, far beyond what general consumer goods and industrial products can achieve. Therefore, each of us needs to enhance our architectural cultural awareness, avoid spending large sums of money on foolish endeavors, and, under our current conditions, make our architecture—the second environment created by humans for their survival—better.

　　多一些建筑文化意识
    思梦
    应当说，这几年房没少盖，钱没少花，但人们对建筑方面的不满情绪却随楼房的增多而加大。这里不想谈分配不公或设施不配套等具体问题。就建筑的整体形象而言，令人赏心悦目的不多，有些则给城镇的改造和发展增添了困难，或破坏了宝贵的建筑文化遗产。
    建筑有人类文化的纪念碑之称，我们要给后人留下怎样的纪念碑呢？盖的楼房越多越暴露出我们在建筑方面的隐疾，致命的不是缺钱，文化的贫乏更可怕。当我们花费了巨大的资金和力量，反而给未来城镇的发展设下难以摆脱的障碍时，是有功？是有罪？现在正值国家压缩基建规模，从决策人、设计人员、施工人员到普通老百姓，都需要冷静下来思考一下建筑文化的问题。
    由于历史的原因，我国在漫长的年代都把应用科学和技术看作“淫技奇巧”，把搞建筑的归入工匠之列。到本世纪２０年代才开始出现经正规训练的建筑师，但在广大的社会层面上，仍不把建筑当作文化，以为不过是“盖房子”而已。在这样的建筑观念的背景下，建筑业在我国至今仍未成长为国民经济的支柱产业。
    纵观人类近９０００年的建筑史，人类的建筑观念大致经历过五个阶段：最初，把建筑作为谋生存的物质手段，为遮风蔽雨防野兽侵袭，穴居野处、构木为窠，即实用建筑阶段；后来，把建筑奉为艺术之母，当作纯艺术作品如绘画、雕塑一般对待，所谓“建筑是凝固的音乐”阶段；到了工业化社会，把建筑看作大工业产品、“住人的机器”，称为功能建筑学阶段；又有人认为“空间是建筑的主角”，进入建筑是空间艺术阶段；现在，越来越多的人认识到建筑是为人类开拓生存空间的科学和艺术，提出了环境建筑学阶段。这是建筑观念上新的里程碑。
    为了我国建筑事业的发展，为了更好地生存，我们必须深刻地认识建筑文化的本质特征，就在于它是“环境文化”、“背景文化”。环境相当于人类、自然和社会的“笼子”，而建筑文化就是为人类设计和建造生存发展空间的“笼子文化”——设计建造住宅、居住区、城市，进行区域规划、国土整治等等，无不需要从文化的角度去观照全体，制定规划，指导实践。要明白，建筑文化既表现在物质方面，也表现在精神方面。作为环境，它既为现实服务，又有历史的连续性和对未来的限定性，直接对人们的心理、生理施加影响，起着能动的传播新的物质文明、新的生活方式的作用，其重要性远不是一般生活用品和工业品所能比拟的。正因为如此，我们每个人都需要增强建筑文化意识，尽可能地避免花大钱办蠢事，在我们现有的条件下，把建筑——人类为自己的生存而创造的第二环境搞得好一些。
