The Pentagon and the White House have differing views on the prospects of Soviet reforms, with Defense Secretary Cheney expressing pessimism. Sununu stated that Cheney does not represent the White House.

Our reporter, Cang Lide, reports from Washington, April 30:

The White House and the State Department today expressed disagreement with Defense Secretary Cheney's remarks that the Soviet reforms are likely to fail and that Gorbachev might be replaced by someone else.

During his flight from Washington to New York, President Bush said, "We need 'Perestroika' (Russian for 'restructuring') to succeed." Sununu, the White House Chief of Staff, today stated that Cheney's remarks do not represent the President. He said that both the President and the Secretary of State hope that Gorbachev's reform movement will succeed. A State Department spokesman pointed out that Secretary of State Baker supports the Soviet reform efforts but does not predict their outcome. Baker will visit Moscow next month to discuss U.S.-Soviet relations.

Yesterday, Cheney said in a television interview that Gorbachev will ultimately fail, "He cannot reform the Soviet economy to make it an efficient modern society"; someone more hostile to the West might replace him. Cheney's remarks have attracted widespread attention in the American media.

　　五角大楼与白宫牴牾    
    切尼对苏联改革态度悲观     
    苏努努称切尼不代表白宫
    本报华盛顿４月３０日电  记者仓立德报道：白宫及国务院今天表示，不同意国防部长切尼关于苏联改革将遭到失败、戈尔巴乔夫可能由他人取代的讲话。
    在从华盛顿飞往纽约途中，布什总统说，“我们需要‘佩雷斯特洛伊卡’（俄语“改革”音译）成功”。白宫办公厅主任苏努努今天表示，切尼的讲话不代表总统。他说，总统和国务卿都希望苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫的改革运动获得成功。国务院发言人指出，国务卿贝克支持苏联的改革努力，同时不预测其结果。贝克将于下月１０日前往莫斯科讨论美苏关系问题。
    切尼昨天在接受电视采访时表示，戈尔巴乔夫最终会失败，“他不能改革苏联经济，使其变成有效率的现代社会”；对西方更持敌意的人可能会取代戈氏。切尼的这番话引起美国舆论界的广泛注意。
