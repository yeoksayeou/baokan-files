	Li Huan to Succeed Yu Kuohua as Taiwan's "Premier"

	BEIJING, May 19 (Xinhua) -- The decision-making body of the Kuomintang (KMT) has decided in principle that Li Huan, the party's secretary-general, will take over as the "Premier" of Taiwan, succeeding Yu Kuohua.

	The KMT's official newspaper, the Central Daily News, reported on its front page that this decision was made on May 18 when Lee Teng-hui met with Li Huan. Today, all major newspapers in Taiwan also reported this news on their front pages.

	The report said that this personnel plan is expected to be formally proposed at the KMT's Central Standing Committee meeting on May 24 and then submitted to the "Legislative Yuan" for approval. It is reported that the decision-making authorities in Taiwan had initially considered delaying this personnel decision. However, considering the possibility of unnecessary personnel speculation and rumors that could affect the stability of Taiwan's political situation, they decided soon after Yu Kuohua submitted his resignation to appoint a successor.

	Li Huan, a native of Hankou, was born in 1917. He graduated from Central University, earned a master's degree from Columbia University in the United States, and has held various positions including director of the KMT's Organization Department, president of Sun Yat-sen University, director of the "Institute for Revolutionary Practice Research," and "Minister of Education." In 1987, he became the secretary-general of the KMT Central Committee and has held this position to this day.

    李焕将出任台湾“行政院长”
    本报香港５月１９日电  台北消息：国民党决策层已原则决定由该党中央秘书长李焕任“行政院长”，接替俞国华。
    台湾国民党机关报《中央日报》在头版头条透露，这次决定是５月１８日下午，李登辉约见李焕时做成的。今日台湾各大报均在头版头条位置刊登这一消息。
    报道说，这次人事方案可望在５月２４日的国民党中常会上正式提出，然后再提请“立法院”同意。据透露，台决策当局曾有意延迟这项人事案的决定，后因顾及可能产生不必要的人事揣测，造成流言纷飞，影响台政局稳定，乃在俞国华提辞呈不久，即内定继任人选。
    李焕，汉口市人，１９１７年生，中央大学毕业，美国哥伦比亚大学硕士，曾任国民党组工会主任、中山大学校长、“革命实践研究院”主任、“教育部长”等职，１９８７年任国民党中央秘书长至今。
