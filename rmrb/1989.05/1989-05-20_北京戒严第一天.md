Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 21st.

On the first day of the implementation of the martial law order signed by Premier Li Peng, which declared martial law in parts of Beijing, the capital's social order remained as usual, and the lives of citizens continued largely undisturbed.

On Tiananmen Square, tens of thousands of students continued their peaceful sit-in. During the day, processions marched through the streets; at night, citizens filled the areas around the square, Chang'an Avenue, and major intersections.
