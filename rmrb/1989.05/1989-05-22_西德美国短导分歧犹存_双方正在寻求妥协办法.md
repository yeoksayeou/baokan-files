Disagreements Persist Between West Germany and the U.S. Over Short-Range Missiles; Both Sides Seek Compromise

According to reports from local newspapers, West German Defense Minister Stoltenberg has returned from his visit to the U.S. with a compromise proposal from the Americans on the short-range missile issue, but fundamental disagreements between the two sides remain unresolved.

The U.S. proposal includes three main points: First, if the conventional arms reduction talks in Vienna reach a certain stage and both sides genuinely establish a balance of forces, and the Warsaw Pact no longer has the capability to invade, NATO can determine the start time for short-range missile talks.

Second, the U.S. hopes that the Bonn government will clearly decide to deploy new short-range nuclear missiles after 1992, rather than continuing to discuss whether to update short-range missiles. In other words, it clearly rejects a third "zero option."

Third, Bonn should withdraw its stance that "the development of short-range missiles is America's own business," as it concerns the entire NATO. If the above three points are met, the U.S. is in principle willing to negotiate with the Soviet Union on short-range missiles.

Stoltenberg had a two-hour discussion with Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Genscher yesterday, discussing the U.S. proposal.

Government spokesman Klein later told reporters that this is only the U.S. position, not the result of negotiations between West Germany and the U.S., but it can serve as a basis for mutual compromise.

According to reports, Chancellor Kohl will write to President Bush today to present West Germany's proposal. Chancellor Kohl will also have telephone conversations with President Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and other NATO leaders to explain West Germany's position. West Germany hopes that a consensus can be reached within NATO this week.

　　西德美国短导分歧犹存
    双方正在寻求妥协办法
    本报波恩５月２２日电  记者江建国报道：据此间报刊报道，刚刚访美归来的西德国防部长施托尔滕贝格带回了美国关于短导问题的妥协建议，但双方的根本分歧仍未得到弥合。
    据报道，美国的妥协建议中主要包括三点内容：第一，如果维也纳常规武器裁军谈判达到了某一阶段，双方确实建立起军备均势，华约已不再具有入侵能力，北约可以确定短导谈判开始的时间；
    第二，希望波恩方面在１９９２年以后明确作出部署新式短程核导弹的决定，而不再就是否更新短导进行讨论。就是说，明确拒绝第三个“零点解决”；
    第三，波恩应收回“短导的研制是美国自己的事情”的态度，因为事关整个北约。如果以上三点得到满足，美国原则上赞同就短程导弹同苏联进行谈判。
    施托尔滕贝格昨天同科尔总理和根舍外长进行了两个小时的谈话，讨论了美国的建议。
    政府发言人克莱因事后对记者们说，这只是美国的立场，而不是西德美国之间谈判的结果，但可以作为相互妥协的一个基础。
    据报道，科尔总理今天将致函布什总统提出西德的建议。科尔总理还将同布什总统、玛·撒切尔首相和其他北约国家领导人通电话，解释西德的立场。西德方面希望这个星期北约内部能达成一致。
