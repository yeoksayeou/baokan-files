Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 10th.

Kádár János, who was relieved of his duties as chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and member of the Central Committee on May 8th due to illness, stated in a reply to the Hungarian party's central committee today: "As a disciplined communist, I accept the decision of the Central Committee."

According to the Hungarian News Agency, Kádár said in his reply: "As many of you know, I have been considering retirement for several months. Since last November, doctors have only allowed me to do a minimal amount of work. Since April, my health condition has further deteriorated."

Kádár expressed his gratitude to his colleagues who had worked with him for decades and to his fellow citizens and voters. He said: "Although I am sure there have been mistakes in my work, I ask you to believe that everything I have done has been with good intentions: I have always put the interests of the Hungarian people, the movement, and the party first. However, I am now more concerned with my own responsibilities. I hope that your view is correct: the new generation that is growing up will objectively evaluate the achievements and shortcomings of the past thirty years."

Kádár also expressed his gratitude to foreign comrades who had cooperated with him in the international communist movement. He said: "Many people can attest that I have never separated my responsibility to the Hungarian people from internationalism."

　　卡达尔表示遵守纪律  接受中央委员会决定
    新华社布达佩斯５月１０日电  本月８日由于病重被解除匈党主席和中央委员职务的卡达尔·亚诺什，今天在给匈党中央的复信中说：“作为一个遵守纪律的共产党人，我接受中央委员会的决定。”
    据匈通社报道，卡达尔在复信中说：“正如你们当中许多人所知道的那样，几个月来，我一直在考虑退职问题。
    自去年１１月以来，医生只允许我做最少量的工作。自４月以来，我的健康状况又进一步恶化。”
    卡达尔在信中向同他几十年一道工作的同志表示感谢，向他的同胞和选民表示感谢。他说：“尽管我在工作中肯定会有错误，但我要请诸位相信，我所做的一切都是出于好意：我总是把匈牙利人民、运动和党的利益摆在首位。”“然而，我现在更多的是考虑自己的责任。我希望你们的下述看法是正确的：正在成长的一代将会客观地评价过去三十年的成绩和缺点。”
    卡达尔还对那些曾在国际共运中同他合作的外国同志表示感谢。他说：“许多人可以证明，我从没有把对匈牙利人民负责同国际主义割裂开来。”
