Gansu Provincial Leader Emphasizes Strict Investigation and Public Handling of "Official Speculators"

    Gansu Provincial Deputy Governor Zhang Wule spoke with students from universities in Lanzhou, reaffirming that regardless of the background or official position of "official speculators," if students report them, the provincial party committee and government will ensure that each case is investigated and handled publicly, without any leniency.

    Since May 9, key leaders of Gansu Province, including Provincial Party Committee Deputy Secretary Lu Kujian, Yan Haiwang, Provincial Government Deputy Governors Zhang Wule, and Mu Yongji, have visited Lanzhou University, Northwest University for Nationalities, Northwest Normal University, and Lanzhou Railway Institute. They engaged in extensive and candid dialogues with nearly 200 student representatives from these schools.

    Punishing "official speculators," eliminating corruption, and strengthening clean governance were hot topics during these dialogues. Students pointed out that Gansu Province has abundant raw materials, and speculators from outside the province flock to profit from them. It is said that those who know about it do not speak up, and those who do not know are helpless. Zhang Wule, in response to the students' questions, introduced the management of raw materials and the determination to investigate "official speculators." He said that Gansu's most abundant raw materials are non-ferrous metals like nickel and aluminum. Since April last year, these products have become scarce, with nickel prices rising by 10,000 yuan per ton each month. To prevent speculation, the provincial government has strictly managed raw materials, establishing a five-person group to oversee the flow of key raw materials. Details such as allocation quantities, prices, destinations, profits, and tax returns are all discussed collectively, with no individual leader having the authority to issue orders. Regarding speculation issues, the provincial government's stance is clear: already discovered cases will be firmly investigated, and undetected cases are welcome to be reported by all parties. Anyone found to be abusing power for personal gain or engaging in speculation will be firmly investigated and severely punished.

    He also reported the situation of reporting to the students. There are 48 reporting centers and 54 reporting hotlines set up across the province. A total of 5,215 cases have been reported, with 3,124 cases handed over to the supervision department for handling, and 1,491 cases handled by the provincial disciplinary inspection department and public security, procuratorate, and judicial departments. Among these cases, 3,848 officials are involved.

　　甘肃省负责人同高校学生对话时强调    
    不管官倒有何背景    
    有案必查公开处理
    本报兰州５月１２日电  记者张述圣报道：日前，甘肃省常务副省长张吾乐同兰州高校学生对话时重申，对于“官倒”，不管他有多大的背景，多显赫的官职，只要同学们举报，省委、省政府保证有一件查处一件，并公开处理，决不姑息。
    ５月９日以来，甘肃省委副书记卢克俭、阎海旺，甘肃省政府副省长张吾乐、穆永吉等主要领导同志，先后到兰州大学、西北民族学院、西北师范大学、兰州铁道学院，同这些学校的近２００名学生代表进行了广泛、坦诚的对话。
    惩治“官倒”、清除腐败、加强廉政建设，是这次对话中的热门话题。学生们提出，甘肃省原材料丰富，省外大倒、小倒趋之若鹜，而且一路顺风，据说是因为知情的不说，不知情的白说。张吾乐回答问题时向学生们介绍了原材料管理情况和查处“官倒”的决心。他说，甘肃最丰富的原材料是有色金属镍和铝，去年４月以来，这两种产品开始紧俏，镍几乎每月每吨以１万元的价格上涨。为了防止倒买倒卖，省政府对原材料的管理是非常严格的，成立了５人小组，对主要原材料流向都要摆到桌面上，如分配数量、价格、去向、利润、返还利税等，由集体商定，任何领导个人无权批条。对于倒卖问题，省政府的决心是，已经发现的要坚决查处，没有发现的欢迎各方举报。只要是以权谋私、倒买倒卖，坚决查处，严惩不贷。
    他还向学生们通报了举报情况，全省设立举报中心４８个，举报电话５４个，接报案件５２１５件，交由监察部门处理的３１２４件，省纪律检察部门和公检法部门处理的１４９１件，这些案件中涉及干部３８４８人。
