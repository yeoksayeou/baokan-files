Línwǔ County in Hunan Province held a grand funeral for an executed criminal in January this year. The incident occurred over three months ago, but it has not been addressed yet.

According to materials provided by the Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court, on January 29th of this year, the Intermediate People's Court of Chenzhou Region in Hunan Province held a sentencing meeting in Linwu County, where a number of serious criminal offenders were executed and sentenced. Liu Yongsheng, a resident of Liujia Village in Wushui Township, was executed for the crimes of intentional homicide and hooliganism. In the afternoon of the same day, at around 4 PM, village cadres including Liu Shengzhou, the village party branch secretary, Liu Xifu, the village head, and Liu Shihua, the village public security chief, led over a hundred villagers. They set off firecrackers and transported Liu Yongsheng's body from the execution site to a bustling area in the county—next to the county's Education Commission building. They set up a funeral tent, placed wreaths, hung banners with inscriptions like "Liu Yongsheng's Name Will Live Forever," and held a funeral service presided over by the village head, Liu Shengzhou, who also delivered a eulogy. The eulogy attacked the current system and laws. Many onlookers gathered, and the funeral tent was just over a hundred meters away from the local judicial authorities, but no one intervened to stop it.

After the funeral, they continued to set off firecrackers and transported the coffin containing Liu Yongsheng's body back to Liujia Village. The body was kept there for three days, with traditional funeral rituals and ceremonies held, causing a negative impact on the local population.

The aforementioned serious incident has been over three months. The relevant authorities submitted a written report to their superiors in mid-April regarding the incident. According to the authorities, as of now, there has been no news of local authorities addressing the incident.

　　临武县为死刑犯开追悼会
    事件已过三个月仍未处理
    本报长沙电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省临武县今年元月曾发生一起为被处决罪犯大吹大擂开追悼会的严重事件。事件已过去３个多月，但至今未作出处理。
    据湖南省高级人民法院提供的材料，今年元月２９日上午，湖南省郴州地区中级人民法院在临武县召开宣判大会，依法处决和判处了一批严重刑事犯罪分子。该县武水乡刘家村村民刘永圣因故意杀人、流氓罪被依法处决。当日下午４时，武水乡刘家村共产党员、村长刘圣周、村党支部书记刘希发、村治保主任刘石华等村干部带领村里百余名群众，燃放鞭炮将刘永圣的尸体从刑场运到县城繁华处——县教委大门边，搭设灵堂，摆上花圈，悬挂“刘永圣永垂不朽”等挽联，由村长刘圣周主持召开追悼会，并致悼词，攻击现行制度和法律。围观者很多。灵堂与当地政法机关相距不过百余米，但无人出面制止。
    追悼会后，又一路燃放鞭炮，将装有刘永圣尸体的棺木运回刘家村，停放３天，吹吹打打做道场，在当地群众中造成恶劣影响。
    上述严重事件已过去３个多月。有关机关４月中旬就上述事件向上级写了书面报告。据该机关反映，到目前为止，还没有得到当地处理该事件的消息。
