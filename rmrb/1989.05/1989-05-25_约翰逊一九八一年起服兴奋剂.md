Johnson began taking performance-enhancing drugs in 1981.

Xinhua News Agency, Ottawa, May 24 - Johnson's personal physician, Astafiev, testified in Toronto on May 24 that Johnson indeed began using anabolic steroids in 1981.

Astafiev stated during a Canadian government hearing in Toronto investigating the use of performance-enhancing drugs by amateur athletes that he first met Johnson in late 1983 at a doctor's office in Toronto and noticed it then.

He said, "At that time, Johnson revealed to me that he had started using anabolic steroids in 1981." Since then, Astafiev began managing Johnson's drug regimen.

Astafiev is one of three key figures in the Johnson scandal. He admitted that he began prescribing performance-enhancing drugs to promising Canadian athletes starting in early 1983.

Astafiev is also the second person to testify in court, acknowledging that Johnson's 1987 world record in the 100 meters and his disqualified 1988 Seoul Olympics 100 meters world record were both achieved with the aid of drugs.

In March of this year, Johnson's coach, Francis, testified for eight days during the hearing.

The current investigation has collected 49 volumes of witness testimony totaling 8,619 pages, along with 181 pieces of evidence, including 12 bottles of a milky substance. It is said that this substance is the drug Johnson used during the Seoul competition.

　　约翰逊一九八一年起服兴奋剂
    新华社渥太华５月２４日电  （记者袁荣生）约翰逊的私人医生阿斯塔芬２４日在多伦多出庭作证，约翰逊确是从１９８１年开始服用类固醇的。
    阿斯塔芬在多伦多加拿大政府调查业余运动员服用兴奋剂的法庭听证会上说，他是在１９８３年后期在多伦多一医生办公室首次遇见约翰逊时觉察出来的。
    他说：“当时约翰逊向我透露，他是从１９８１年开始服用类固醇的。”从那以后，阿斯塔芬开始控制约翰逊的药物服用计划。
    阿斯塔芬是约翰逊丑闻中的三个关键人物之一。他承认他自己是从１９８３年初开始给加拿大有希望的运动员开兴奋剂药方的。
    阿斯塔芬同时也是第二位出庭作证，承认约翰逊１９８７年创造的百米世界纪录和被取消的１９８８年汉城奥运会百米世界纪录均是药物起的作用。
    今年３月，约翰逊的教练弗朗西斯在听证会上作了８天的证词。
    这次调查目前已收集了４９卷共８６１９页的证人的证词和收集了１８１个证据，其中包括１２瓶奶白色物质。据说这种物质正是约翰逊在汉城比赛期间服用的药物。
