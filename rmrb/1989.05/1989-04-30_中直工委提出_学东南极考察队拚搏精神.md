The Central Committee's Work Committee recently held a report meeting on the Southern Antarctic Expedition in Beijing, calling on Communist Party members in the Central Committee's agencies to learn from the expedition team's spirit of struggle and do their best in their own jobs.

Not long ago, 116 expedition team members worked together, struggled tenaciously, and completed the construction of the Zhongshan Station, achieving the goal of building and wintering in the same year. They also completed scientific research tasks in meteorology, biology, hydrology, and geology. Expedition team leader Guo Kun gave a report at the meeting, earning rounds of applause from hundreds of attendees.
