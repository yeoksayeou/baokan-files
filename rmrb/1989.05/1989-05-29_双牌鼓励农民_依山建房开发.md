Double Card Encourages Farmers to Build and Develop on Mountains

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 29th

The People's Daily reports that in Hunan Province, Double Card County is guiding farmers to move to and build homes on barren mountains and slopes. Currently, more than five thousand households, which account for one-fifth of the total, have built homes on the mountains and established over 2,500 small orchards, fruit gardens, tea gardens, bamboo gardens, forest farms, and livestock farms, among others.

Double Card County is a mountainous county with "nine mountains, half water, and half fields." To effectively manage the relocation and housing of farmers, the county's Party Committee and government have taken encouraging measures, rewarding households that have achieved success in developing courtyard economies after relocation.

　　双牌鼓励农民
    依山建房开发
    本报讯  湖南省双牌县引导农民散迁荒山荒坡建房居住。目前，占五分之一的五千多农户已依山建房，建立了适度家庭规模经营的小桔园、小果园、小茶园、小竹园、小林场、小牧场等十小园二千五百多个。
    双牌县是“九山半水半分田”的山区小县。为了搞好农民迁徙建房，县委、县政府采取鼓励措施，对迁居后发展庭院经济作出成绩的农户实行奖励。
