For a decade, various Chinese circus troupes have relied on frequent overseas performances to sustain themselves. This year, however, the number of overseas performances has significantly decreased compared to last year, while the domestic market remains sluggish. Circus industry insiders are warning: China's circus industry is facing a hidden crisis.

Since the early 1980s, Chinese circus acts have consistently won gold medals in international competitions. Additionally, after a long period of isolation, the mystique surrounding China and the unique national characteristics of Chinese circus performances have made them highly popular abroad. Foreign merchants have eagerly invited Chinese circus troupes to perform overseas. Over the past 10 years, Chinese circus acts have toured all five continents, earning substantial foreign exchange and becoming one of the wealthiest performing arts groups. However, 10 years later, that mystique has faded, and the repetition of performances and the "mechanized" acting of performers have greatly reduced the interest of foreign audiences.

The domestic market, with few spectators and low ticket prices, has left various circus troupes in a difficult situation of "big performances mean big losses, small performances mean small losses, no performances mean no losses." The allure of earning foreign exchange through overseas performances has exacerbated the tendency of circus troupes to become elitist, focusing outward and distancing themselves from domestic audiences. If there are no overseas performance opportunities, many circus troupes may not perform or practice for an entire year, becoming lax and relying on state subsidies. In years with fewer overseas performances, they may even struggle to pay salaries.

The circus craze has cooled down abroad and cannot be rekindled domestically. The Chinese circus industry must seriously consider its own survival issues. Experts point out that the circus industry urgently needs reform. First, it must shift its focus from abroad to domestic, and then to the world; second, it must innovate and strengthen the training of performers, opposing the repetition of performances and the tendency to rely on old routines, in order to win over audiences and open up the domestic market.

### 国外消热　国内难热  中国杂技潜伏危机

　　国外消热　国内难热    
    中国杂技潜伏危机
    本报讯  十年以来一直靠频繁出国演出维持生计的中国各杂技团开始受到外商冷落，今年出国演出的团次较去年严重减少，而国内市场仍然处于萧条之中。杂技界人士惊呼：中国杂技潜伏着危机。
    由于８０年代初以来，中国杂技在国际比赛中连年获金奖，也由于长期封闭之后外国人对中国的神秘感和中国杂技浓烈的民族特色，中国杂技在国外一时大为走红，外商竞相邀请中国杂技团体出国演出。在过去的１０年中，中国杂技走遍了五大洲，赚得了不少外汇，成为各艺术团体中的富裕户。１０年之后的今天，那种神秘感已不复存在，节目的雷同化和演员表演的“机器化”使外国观众的兴趣大减。
    观众不多，票价低廉的国内行情，使各杂技团仍然处于“大演大赔、小演小赔，不演不赔”的难堪局面。出国演出赚外汇的诱惑助长了杂技团贵族化倾向，眼光向外，脱离了国内观众。如果没有出国机会，很多杂技团甚至一年不演出，不练功，松松垮垮，坐吃国家补贴。这样，出国少的年月便连工资也发不出了。
    杂技热在国外消退了，在国内也热不起来，中国杂技界不得不认真考虑自身的生存问题。有关专家指出，杂技急需改革。首先得把眼光从国外收回来，立足国内，再面向世界；其次必须推陈出新，加强演员的表演训练，反对节目的雷同化和吃老本的倾向，以便赢得观众，开辟国内市场。　　  　　　（王前海）
