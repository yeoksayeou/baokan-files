The national gymnastics individual competition concluded in Nanjing on the evening of May 20th. Guo Linxian from the August First Sports Team won the men's all-around championship, and Yang Bo from the Zhejiang Team won the women's all-around championship. This competition adopted the new regulations for 1989-1992 published by the International Gymnastics Federation. Due to the short training time and unfamiliarity with the new routines, errors increased during the competition. In the men's horizontal bar event, 46 out of 63 participants had unstable landings; more than half of the participants in the pommel horse event made mistakes.

The second and third place in the men's all-around were secured by Li Ge from Sichuan and Wang Chongsheng from Guangdong, respectively. The second and third places in the women's all-around were secured by Chen Cuiting from Hunan and Fan Di from Shanghai, respectively. In the individual events, Li Chunyang from Guangdong won the men's floor exercise, horizontal bar, and rings championships; Li Ge won the pommel horse championship; Qiao Liang won the men's vault championship; Yu Bo won the parallel bars championship; Fan Di won the women's uneven bars championship; Chen Cuiting won the women's floor exercise and vault championships; Li Yan from Hunan won the women's balance beam championship.

Additionally, the national gymnastics training work conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on May 23rd.

　　全国体操个人赛在南京结束
    国林显杨波获男女全能冠军
    本报讯  １９８９年全国体操个人赛５月２０日晚在南京结束。八一队的国林显获得男子个人全能冠军，浙江队的杨波获得女子个人全能冠军。这次比赛采用了国际体操联合会新公布的１９８９——１９９２年度的规定动作。由于选手们练习时间短，还不熟悉这套动作，因此，比赛场上失误现象增多。男子单杠，６３人中有４６人落地不稳；鞍马比赛中失手的运动员占参赛的一半以上。
    获得本次比赛男子全能第二、第三名的分别是四川李舸、广东王崇升；获女子全能第二、第三名的分别是湖南陈翠婷、上海樊迪。在单项比赛中，广东李春阳获男子自由体操、单杠、吊环三项冠军；李舸获鞍马冠军；乔良获男子跳马冠军；于波获双杠冠军；樊迪获女子高低杠冠军；陈翠婷获女子自由体操和跳马两项冠军；湖南李燕获女子平衡木冠军。
    另外，全国体操训练工作会议定于５月２３日在南京召开。
