The 571 train explosion case has been solved. The perpetrator, Peng Youguo, has been apprehended.

On April 30, the 571 passenger train from Guiyang to Dayawan exploded at Xiaochongtou station on the Gui-Kun line. The Public Security Bureau of Guizhou Province, the Chengdu Railway Public Security Bureau, and the Gui Railway Public Security Sub-bureau immediately organized police officers to investigate and solve the case. After 13 days of investigation, the case of this premeditated and serious incident was finally solved.

The criminal, Peng Youguo, is a 57-year-old resident of Zijing County, Guizhou. He was originally a temporary worker at a power station but was fired due to moral degradation. Peng has a history of bad deeds and did not change his ways. His wife, He, divorced him in 1987.

This year in April, Peng heard that He was going to get married on "May Day" and thus harbored a vengeful plan. On April 30, Peng packed 6 sticks of dynamite and detonators in a grass-green shoulder bag, set the fuse, and boarded the 571 train at Guanliao Station, intending to seek revenge at He's home. After boarding the train, Peng suddenly had the malicious idea to blow up the train. When the train stopped at Xiaochongtou Station, he squatted at the connection between carriages 9 and 10, lit the fuse with a cigarette, and injured 21 people on the spot. He himself was also injured in the explosion due to not being able to avoid it.

　　５７１次列车爆炸案破获
    本报贵阳５月２０日电  记者潘帝都报道：５７１次旅客列车爆炸案（见５月２日本报二版）已侦破，罪犯彭友国被捉拿归案。
    ４月３０日，从贵阳至大湾的５７１次旅客列车在贵昆线小冲头车站发生爆炸后，贵州省公安厅、成都铁路公安局和贵铁公安分局立即组织干警侦破。经过１３天的调查侦察，终于破获了这起蓄意制造的重大恶性案件。
    案犯彭友国系贵州织金县人，５７岁，原是一个电站的临时工，因道德败坏被开除。彭劣迹甚多，又恶习不改，其妻何某于１９８７年与他离婚。
    今年４月，彭听说何某将于“五一”结婚，遂起报复恶念。４月３０日，彭用草绿色挎包装上６节炸药和雷管，放好导火绳，从关寨车站上了５７１次列车，准备到何某家寻报复。彭上车后，却突然萌动爆炸列车的恶念。在列车停靠小冲头车站后，蹲在９、１０号车厢连接处，用香烟点燃导火绳，当场炸伤２１人。他自己因躲避不及，也被炸伤。
