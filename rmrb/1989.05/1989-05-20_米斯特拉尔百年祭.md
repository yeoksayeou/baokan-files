It was some mysterious force, like a magnet, that drew me to make three trips from Santiago to visit the "Love Child Creek" vineyard. At the peak of Monte Grande lies the resting place of Gabriela Mistral, a contemporary Chilean poet, a renowned writer of the Americas, and the first Latin American to win the Nobel Prize in Literature.

The car ascended through lush greenery. We stood silently in front of a massive white stone monument to pay our respects. The monument is inscribed with olive branches, and above it are the poet's pen name and her birth and death dates (1989.4–1957.1). Below, her personal motto reads: "The people create the artist, just as the soul emerges from the body." This profound statement is a high-level summary of the close relationship between this poet and the vineyards and the people of Vicuña that nurtured her growth.

Vicuña is located in the fourth region of Chile, Coquimbo, a green oasis in the middle of the northern Atacama Desert. During our long journey, we watched the sun set over the river and the lone smoke rise over the desert. Driving along the "Love Child Creek" valley, we saw vineyards stretching across the mountains, orderly trellises laden with clusters of ripe grapes, red like agate, green like jade, truly delightful. Perhaps their sweet nectar was the first nourishment for the poet's genius and inspiration. Otherwise, how could a "golden phoenix" have flown out from this remote mountain? No wonder, during the Nobel Prize ceremony, the Swedish Academy member Alma Sjöblom praised Mistral: "The poet, with her motherly hands, brewed a drink for us, making us feel the fragrance of the earth, making our hearts no longer thirsty. This is the spring from Gabriela Mistral's heart in the Love Child Creek valley, its source will never dry up."

This year marks the 100th anniversary of Mistral's birth. People are commemorating her in various ways. Around April 7, the activities reached their peak. Admirers from around the world and across Chile followed the flow of "Love Child Creek" to trace the poet's footsteps; they sang and laid flowers at her grave; poets and writers from the United States, Japan, Argentina, and Chile gathered in the poet's hometown to hold an international symposium on "The Life and Works of Mistral"; the post office issued commemorative stamps; her works have been translated into more than a dozen languages and published worldwide. Theaters also performed concerts based on her poems. The Chilean National Library held a comprehensive exhibition introducing the poet. In Chile, 1989 was named "Mistral Year."

The poet's original name was Lucía Godoy. Her former residence is a simple, rustic house made of mud and wood, with a modest entrance and plain furnishings. The memorial hall displays the poet's desk, writing instruments, and various memorabilia used during her lifetime. The walls are adorned with photographs from various periods, particularly the historical scene of her receiving the Nobel Prize in Literature from King Gustav V in Stockholm on November 12, 1945, which is the most captivating.

From a young age, the poet experienced much hardship. At the age of three, her father left home and never returned, forcing her to fend for herself and rely on her tenacious will to learn. She had a special talent and love for poetry. At the age of 14, she published her debut works, "Solitude" and "Soul," in the *Coquimbo Journal*. The following year, she was hired to teach at the local primary school in her hometown of Compañía, and later taught in many cities and served as a principal. At 17, she fell in love for the first time, deeply in love with a local railway worker, Romelio Ureta. But Ureta betrayed her love. After being abandoned by another girl, he committed suicide. This event caused Mistral deep emotional pain, even leading her to vow never to marry. With her indomitable will, she overcame the torment of love and decided to devote her entire being to poetry and education. At the age of 24, during the flower festival poetry competition in Santiago, she recited her masterpiece "Fourteen Lines on Death" with boundless passion and won first place, becoming a renowned talent in the poetry world. From then on, she wrote like a silkworm spinning silk and a bee making honey, unyielding and persistent. In 1922, she published her first poetry collection, *Desolation*, in New York, shaking the world of literature; two years later, she published her second collection, *Tenderness*, in Madrid, dedicating her fiery maternal love to the children of the world; her third collection, *Fruit of the Earth* (1929), strongly protested the misfortunes of the Indian and Jewish peoples. After 1925, she entered the diplomatic world, serving as a diplomat in Colombia, Spain, Portugal, Guatemala, South Africa, Brazil, the United States, Mexico, and Italy, and later as a special envoy to the United Nations. In the 1930s, she published *Ten Principles of Art* and the poetry collection *Tala*, reflecting her rigorous attitude towards creation and broad intellectual horizon. In particular, her extensive travels around the world expanded her creative domain from the narrow village valley to the vast world; from the melancholic murmurs of love to the loud cries for the broad masses of laboring people. Her longing for her homeland, her love for the people, her calls for freedom, peace, women's liberation, and children's happiness became the "trumpet of human progress"; became a banner of the burgeoning modernist literary movement in Latin America at that time; became one of the pioneers of the new world poetry trend.

Of course, due to the constraints of the times, her poetry often adopted a petty-bourgeois humanitarian stance or held fatalistic views when criticizing and exposing the evils of the old system and social ills. However, her ideals and integrity, her talents and genius, her unremitting efforts, finally made her reach the pinnacle of the international poetry world, winning a dazzling gem, and bringing pride and glory to the Chilean nation.

　　米斯特拉尔百年祭
    孙国维
    不知是一股什么力量，像磁铁一样吸引着我，使我不辞千里从圣地亚哥三次来踏访“爱儿溪”葡萄幽谷。因为在蒙特格兰德山之巅安息着智利当代女诗人、美洲著名作家、拉美第一位诺贝尔文学奖获得者加夫列拉·米斯特拉尔。
    车轮盘旋，跃上葱茏。我们在一座巨大的白石碑前默默致敬。碑上镌刻着橄榄枝，上方有诗人的笔名和生卒年月（１９８９．４—１９５７．１）；下方有她的座右铭：“人民造就艺术家，如同灵魂出自躯体”。这至理名言是这位诗人同哺育她成长的葡萄园和维库尼亚乡亲密切关系的高度概括。
    维库尼亚位于智利第四大区塞雷那，是北部沙漠阿塔卡马中的一片绿洲，我们在漫漫悠长的旅途中送走长河落日，迎来大漠孤烟，沿着“爱儿溪”河谷驾车疾驰，但见漫山遍野的葡萄园，整整齐齐的支架上挂满了串串丰硕的果实，红如玛瑙，绿似碧玉，煞是可爱。其醇香蜜汁，也许正是哺育诗人天才和灵感的初乳。要不，为何偏偏在这孤山僻壤飞出了一只诗坛“金凤凰”？！无怪在诺贝尔奖授奖仪式上瑞典文学院院士亚尔玛·吉尔伯格要那样赞颂米斯特拉尔：“诗人用她那慈母般的手为我们酿制了饮料，使我们觉到了泥土的芳香，使我们的心灵不再感到饥渴。这是来自爱儿溪山谷的加夫列拉·米斯特拉尔的心田里的泉水，它的源头永远不会枯竭。”
    今年是米斯特拉尔诞辰一百周年，人们以各种形式纪念她。４月７日前后，活动推向高潮。来自世界各地和智利全国的敬慕者纷纷沿着“爱儿溪”的流淌寻访诗人的足迹；用歌声和鲜花祭奠于她的墓前；美国、日本、阿根廷和智利等国的骚人墨客云集在诗人的故乡举行“米斯特拉尔生平和作品”的国际讨论会；邮局发行纪念她的邮票；她的作品已被译成十多种文字在世界各地出版。剧场也上演为她诗篇谱曲的音乐会。智利国家图书馆还举办全面介绍诗人的大型展览，在智利，１９８９年被命名为“米斯特拉尔年”。
    诗人原名卢西娅·戈多伊。故居是一幢土木结构的瓦平房，门庭简陋，陈设朴素。纪念馆中陈列着诗人生前用过的书桌、文房器皿和各种纪念品，墙上挂着各个时期的活动照片，尤以１９４５年１１月１２日在瑞典首都斯德哥尔摩接受古斯塔沃国王授予的诺贝尔文学奖的历史场面最为引人入胜。
    诗人从幼年起便饱尝人间艰辛。３岁那年父亲弃家出走并一去不返，她不得不独立谋生，并靠坚韧的毅力自学文化知识。她对于诗歌有特殊的天赋和爱好。１４岁时便在塞雷那《科金博报》上发表《孤寂》和《灵魂》等处女作。次年受聘在故乡孔帕尼亚小学执教，后来在许多城市当过教师和中学校长。１７岁情窦初开，陷入热恋，同本乡一名铁路职员罗梅里奥·乌雷塔相爱。但乌雷塔辜负了她一片痴情。他在被另一名姑娘抛弃之后举枪自杀。这使米斯特拉尔精神受到创伤，甚至发誓终生不嫁。她用顽强的毅力摆脱了爱情的熬煎，决心将全部身心倾注于诗歌创作和教育事业。２４岁时，在圣地亚哥的花节诗歌竞赛会上，她以无限激情朗诵了杰作《死的十四行诗》而独占鳌头，从此名噪诗坛，成为名闻遐迩的才女。自此，她像春蚕吐丝，金蜂造蜜，锲而不舍，持之以恒。１９２２年在纽约出版了她第一本诗集《绝望》，声震世界文坛；两年后又在马德里发表第二本诗集《柔情》，把炽烈的母爱奉献给世界儿童；第三本诗集《有刺的树》（１９２９年）则为印第安人和犹太民族的不幸遭遇大鸣不平；１９２５年后她涉足外交界，先后在哥伦比亚、西班牙、葡萄牙、危地马拉、南非、巴西、美国、墨西哥和意大利等国担任外交使节，晚年还出任驻联合国特使。３０年代发表的《艺术十原则》和诗集《塔拉》集中反映了她严谨的创作态度和开阔的思想境界。尤其是周游列国的广阔视野使她的创作领域从狭小的乡村幽谷转向大千世界；从缠绵悱恻的沉吟低唱变成为广大劳苦民众的大声疾呼。她那眷恋祖国、热爱人民、为自由和平、为妇女解放和为儿童幸福的呐喊成为“人类进步的号角”；成为当时拉丁美洲蓬勃兴起的现代主义文学运动的一面旗帜；成为世界新诗歌潮流的先驱者之一。
    当然，由于时代的局囿，她在诗歌中对罪恶的旧制度和社会弊端的针砭和揭露往往采取小资产阶级人道主义立场或抱有宿命论的观点。然而，她的理想和情操，她的天赋和才华，她的不懈登攀，终于使她在国际诗坛的金字塔尖摘下了一颗璀璨的明珠，为智利民族争得了自豪和光荣。
