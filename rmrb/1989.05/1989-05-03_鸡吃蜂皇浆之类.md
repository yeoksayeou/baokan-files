Readers, do not think that this title is about a method for rapid chicken and duck growth, gaining a pound a day, and ready for market in three to five days, as a new path to wealth.

Recently, during a tax, financial, and price inspection, a unit organized a team to self-inspect the unit's financial execution. Among the checks, several invoices for purchasing royal jelly and milk powder, each amounting to over one hundred yuan, were found under the production and operation projects. The invoices were marked "for chickens" and "for ducks."

Royal jelly and milk powder are health supplements, not food for chickens and ducks. If even the principal is lost, how can the breeders make a profit? It is obvious that these items were consumed by some highly intelligent "chickens and ducks." Such absurd reimbursements were approved by our supervising officials with a stroke of the pen: "Approved." This is truly impressive!

Financial inspections only check if the procedures are complete and if the signatures are all present, right? The "chickens and ducks" are indeed despicable, but shouldn't we also ask, "Who sent them to your mouth every day?"

### 鸡吃蜂皇浆之类

专栏：

　　鸡吃蜂皇浆之类
    读者诸君不要以为此标题是鸡鸭生长速成法，一天长一斤，三五天即可脱手，是条致富的新途径。
    不久前，一单位在税收、财务物价大检查中，组织一班人马，对本单位财务执行情况进行自查。其中，查出生产经营项目中几张购买蜂皇浆和奶粉、数目百元以上的发票上，注明“鸡吃、鸭吃……”
    蜂皇浆、奶粉，强身益寿。非鸡鸭之食品补品，果如此连老本都要赔尽，饲养者谈何赚钱。显而易见，是被有灵性的高级“鸡鸭”食用了。如此荒唐的报销，竟得到我们的主管大人的大笔一挥：“同意”，实在佩服！
    财务检查，只查手续是否完备、签字是否齐全行吗？“鸡鸭”固然可恶，可“谁遣朝朝入君口”不是也该问一问吗？
