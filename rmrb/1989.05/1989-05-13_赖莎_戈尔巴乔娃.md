Born in Siberia, Raisa Gorbacheva, whose father was a railway engineer, was naturally beautiful and intelligent. In her youth, she studied at Moscow University's Department of Marxism-Leninism Philosophy. Her lively personality and outstanding academic performance won the admiration of her classmate, Gorbachev. They fell in love and married in 1954.

After graduating, the couple was assigned to the Caucasus—Gorbachev's hometown. The husband worked in the Komsomol, while the wife taught at a school. They worked and lived there for 23 years.

In the late 1970s, Gorbachev was transferred to the position of Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and Raisa returned to Moscow with her husband after a long separation. From then on, she taught at her alma mater, the Department of Marxism-Leninism Philosophy, and displayed her talents. Facing young students, she eloquently lectured on philosophy and sociology, subjects she was deeply interested in.

Thirty-five years of shared joys and sorrows, thirty-five years of mutual understanding, their love was deep and extraordinary. Gorbachev admired and valued his wife's intelligence and character, as he said, "I discuss everything with Raisa." Raisa also had a "significant influence" on Gorbachev. People called her a "sharp observer of the times and public sentiment," able to help her husband "become wiser and more mature" in politics. In Raisa's eyes, she was not just his wife. She frankly and seriously told reporters, "We are true friends, very in tune with each other. Being with him, I feel extremely fortunate."

With the beginning of the Gorbachev era in the Soviet Union, Raisa gradually emerged on the international diplomatic stage. In just a few brief stays in Paris, London, Geneva, Washington, and Eastern European countries, people had already witnessed her sharp mind, quick thinking, and profound wisdom. In London, she appropriately quoted Shakespeare to express her thoughts, much to the admiration of the accompanying British literary figures. In Paris, at Notre Dame Cathedral, the Élysée Palace, the Louvre, the Place de la Concorde, and the Cardin fashion store, she calmly discussed French culture, communication facilities, and Parisian fashion. In Washington, while touring the White House with Nancy Reagan, she asked penetrating questions about historical and cultural details, making the host difficult to answer. In Geneva, while her husband engaged in a verbal battle with Reagan over missile issues, she and Nancy opened a politically significant "fashion war." Public opinion acknowledged Raisa as the winner. However, Raisa thought, "It is unfair to discuss who won or lost; one should say that each has their strengths." She spoke very appropriately. Nevertheless, in many situations, she was witty and humorous, chatting freely on a wide range of topics, but she never discussed herself.

In recent years, Raisa has visited many Western countries. In the beautiful springtime of May, she will accompany her husband on a visit to the ancient Eastern civilization—China. The brilliant Chinese culture and the achievements of reform and opening up have always attracted her. People have not forgotten that in the autumn of 1986, when Sino-Soviet relations were in a delicate state, she unusually visited the Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition held in Moscow. During the 1 hour and 30 minutes of her visit, she enthusiastically viewed every booth, enthusiastically praised China's achievements in various fields, and expressed good wishes to the Chinese people! The next day, she enthusiastically went to the Chinese Embassy to appreciate the Chinese fashion show. She praised the Chinese girls' slender figures, artistic sense, and the harmony of their clothing, movements, and expressions.

"Very happy to see that Sino-Soviet relations have improved in all aspects." This was her parting remark as she left the embassy.

　　赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃
    师秀峰
    出生在西伯利亚，父亲是铁路工程师的赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃，生来貌美聪慧。她青年时代就读于莫斯科大学马列主义哲学系，她的活泼的性格，出色的成绩，赢得同窗学友戈尔巴乔夫的青睐。彼此相爱，并于１９５４年结为伉俪。
    大学毕业，夫妻双双一同分配到高加索——戈尔巴乔夫的故乡，丈夫从事共青团工作，妻子在一所学校任教。在那里，他们工作、生活了２３个春秋。
    ７０年代末，戈尔巴乔夫调任苏共中央书记处书记，赖莎随丈夫回到久别的莫斯科。从此，她在母校马列主义哲学系的讲台上一展风采。面对青年学生，她滔滔不绝地讲授她深感兴趣的哲学和社会学。
    ３５年的风雨同舟，３５年的心随意往，她与他感情笃厚，非同一般。戈尔巴乔夫敬佩并器重妻子的才智、人品，如他所云：“我与赖莎无所不谈。”而赖莎对戈尔巴乔夫亦有着“相当影响”。人们称她是“敏锐的时局和民情的观察者”，能在政治上助丈夫“更加明智、成熟”。在赖莎眼里，她不仅是他的妻子。她坦率、认真地告诉记者，“我们是真正的朋友，彼此间非常默契。与他在一起，我觉得极其幸运。”
    随着苏联戈尔巴乔夫时代的开始，赖莎亦渐渐地在国际外交舞台上崭露头角。仅在巴黎、伦敦、日内瓦、华盛顿和东欧等国家几次短暂的逗留，人们就已领略了她的头脑聪颖、思路敏捷和博才睿智。在伦敦，她恰到好处地引用莎士比亚名言来表述自己的想法，令陪同的英国文艺界人士颇为赞叹；在巴黎圣母院、爱丽舍宫、卢浮宫、协和广场和卡丹时装店，她从容纵谈法国文化、通讯设施和巴黎时装；在华盛顿，与里根夫人南希同游白宫，就历史和文化细节咄咄逼人地提问，令主人感到难于回答；在日内瓦，当她的丈夫与里根就导弹问题展开唇枪舌剑的同时，她与南希则开辟了具有政治含义的“时装战”。舆论公认，赖莎是优胜者。而赖莎却认为“谈论谁胜谁负是不公正的，应该说，各有所长。”她讲的很得体。不过，在许多场合，她风趣诙谐，谈笑风生，话题广泛，却唯独不谈自己。
    几年来，赖莎涉足了西方众多国家。在５月花红柳绿的美好时光，她又将随丈夫出访东方文明古国——中国。灿烂的神州文化和改革开放的成果，一直吸引着她。人们没有忘记，在中苏关系处在微妙状态中的１９８６年金秋，她非同寻常地光顾了在莫斯科举行的中国经济贸易展览会。在１小时３０分钟的参观过程中，她情致盎然地观看了每一个展台，热情称颂中国在各方面取得的成就，并向中国人民表示了良好的祝愿！第二天，她又兴致勃勃地到中国大使馆欣赏中国时装表演。她称中国姑娘身材苗条，富有艺术感，服装、动作和表情十分和谐。
    “很高兴地看到中苏关系在各方面有所改善。”这是她离开大使馆时临别赠言。　（附图片）
    赖莎与撒切尔夫人亲切交谈。
