In the April 10 issue of the *Dadi* supplement, I read an article defending the uniformity of architecture, which left me puzzled.

The uniformity of products or architecture often results from simple reproduction. Its emergence has deep social roots. Broadly speaking, the phenomenon of uniformity has been quite common and prominent in our social life. This is not only closely related to certain deep-seated problems from China's long history of feudal society, such as the rigid centralized political system, the cultural notion of despising craftsmanship and creation, and the production methods of the small peasant economy; it is also linked to certain mistakes in our political, economic, and cultural decision-making since the founding of the nation. Treacherous political storms have made people speak insincerely, resulting in unanimous public opinion. The underdevelopment of the commodity economy and the lack of a regulatory mechanism for social distribution have made people reluctant to reform and innovate, resulting in product varieties that remain unchanged for decades or are merely copied and imitated. The closed cultural vision has led to simplified and single-minded thinking patterns, causing value concepts to become distorted.

As people's self-awareness of subjectivity strengthens, diversity and individuality will inevitably become the trend in cultural choices. Taking residential architecture in history as an example, Beijing's siheyuan, Tianjin's small Western-style houses, and Jiangnan's folk residences are not all of the same model. Modern architectural forms are even more diverse, and the rectangular box structure, once considered unquestionable, is not unbreakable.

In terms of residential architecture, although its function seems very single, there are actually multiple choices. People of different types necessarily have different activity characteristics and movement patterns, so buildings should have the adaptability to promote different activities of people. Buildings are regulators of climate conditions, and buildings in different latitudes naturally have different thermal insulation requirements. At the same time, according to different situations, there are also different requirements for lighting, acoustics, and humidity control. Buildings, as carriers of culture, will inevitably bear the characteristics of local culture, have the sensitivity to the environment, reflect the atmosphere of the environment, and the behavioral psychology of local people. In addition, buildings must also be based on local resource conditions; building materials, land conditions, and terrain features all directly affect the structure and shape of buildings. The requirements of diversity and adaptability not only apply to public buildings but also, in general, to residential buildings. With the development of housing commodification, it will inevitably increase people's choices for housing and promote the adaptability of housing construction to different household requirements. The public participation in housing design that has emerged abroad is indeed a powerful means to improve the pertinence and adaptability of architectural design.

Some people seem to have a misunderstanding, perhaps an excuse, that industrial production can only produce uniform products. In fact, this is only a phenomenon of the early stage of industrial development. The standardization of industrial products and the modularization of buildings mainly refer to basic components and parts. Standardization can improve quality and reduce costs. However, it does not exclude the diversification of specifications and does not completely determine the overall shape of the product or building. Just like children's building blocks, Rubik's Cube, and magic sticks, although they are composed of a limited number of standardized components, they can still produce a myriad of color and shape combinations. Even if it is the same form of house, if there is a slight change in the arrangement of the external space structure, it will also make people have different spatial experiences. In fact, industrial production provides a broad prospect for architects and product designers to exert their creativity.

　　“千篇一律”解析
    徐恒醇
    在４月１０日《大地》副刊上读到有关为建筑千篇一律一辩的论述，顿感疑惑。
    产品或建筑的千篇一律，往往是简单再生产的产物。它的出现有深远的社会根源。广而言之，“千篇一律”的现象过去在我们的社会生活中十分普遍而又十分突出。这不仅与我国长期封建社会的某些痼疾密切相关，如僵化的大一统的政治体制、鄙薄器用和造物活动的文化观念，以及小农经济的生产方式等；而且也与建国以来我们在政治、经济和文化决策中的某些失误不无联系。险峻的政治风云使人们言不由衷，表现为社会舆论的“一致”。商品经济的不发达，社会分配缺乏调节机制，使人们不思改革和创新，表现为产品品种的数十年一贯制或照抄模仿。文化视野的封闭，造成思维模式的简单化和单一化，使价值观念产生畸形。
    随着人们主体性的自我意识增强，因此多样化和个性化就必定成为文化选择的趋向。以历史上出现的住房建筑为例，北京的四合院、天津的小洋楼、江南的民居，也并非是一种模式。现代建筑的形式则更加多样，被视为天经地义的方匣子结构也并非不可突破。
    就住宅建筑而论，看起来它的功能似乎极其单一，实际上也存在多样的选择。不同类型的人必然具有不同的活动特点和流动路线，因此，要求建筑具有促进人们不同活动的适应性。建筑是对气候条件的调节器，不同纬度的建筑自然具有不同的保温要求，同时根据不同情况对于采光、声学防护和湿度控制也要求各异。建筑作为一种文化的载体，总会带有地域文化的特征，具有对环境的感应特征，反映出环境的氛围和当地人们的行为心理。此外，建筑还要依据当地的资源条件；建筑材料、土地状况和地形特征等都直接影响建筑的结构和造型。多样化和适应性的要求不仅适用于公用建筑，在总体上也适用于住宅建筑。随着住房商品化的发展，必然会增加人们对于住房的选择，也会促进住房建设对于不同住户要求的适应性。国外所出现的对住房建筑设计的公众参与，正是提高建筑设计的针对性和适应性的有力手段。
    有人似乎存在一种误解，也许是一种遁词，以为工业化生产只能产生出千篇一律的产品。其实，这只是工业发展原始阶段的现象。工业产品的标准化、建筑的模件化，主要是对于基本零件和构件而言的。标准化可以提高质量，降低成本。但是它并不排斥规格的多样化，也不完全决定整个产品或建筑的造型。正如儿童玩的积木、魔方、魔棍一样，虽然是以有限的标准化构件组成，但仍可产生出千变万化的色彩和形态的组合。退一步说，即使同样形式的房子，如果在外部空间结构的安排上略有变化，也会使人产生出不同的空间感受。实际上，工业化生产为建筑师和产品设计师创造力的发挥提供了广阔的前景。
