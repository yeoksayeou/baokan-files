Agricultural Science Application and Promotion Remain Weak Links

Li Peng Invites Agricultural Experts and Professors for a Discussion to Seek Solutions

Participants' Views Will Play an Important Role in Decision-Making

BEIJING, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng of the State Council invited agricultural experts and professors from Beijing for a discussion this morning in Zhongnanhai to jointly study the issue of developing agriculture through the application of scientific and technological achievements.

State Councilor Chen Junshen, State Council Secretary Lu Gan, Minister of Agriculture He Kang, and dozens of agricultural experts and professors from Beijing attended the meeting.

Li Peng said at the beginning of the discussion that the current situation of China's agriculture is grim, and the Party Central Committee and the State Council are very concerned about agriculture. To develop agriculture, we need to rely on policies, science and technology, and investment. By the end of this century, China's total grain production needs to reach a new level, and agricultural science and technology need to make new breakthroughs. The experts and professors present have either long been engaged in scientific research and teaching or long been engaged in scientific research and promotion work in rural areas, and have rich experience.

The purpose of inviting everyone here is to exchange views with everyone and, more importantly, to listen to everyone's opinions on how to revitalize agriculture through the application of scientific and technological achievements.

Eleven experts and professors spoke at the meeting. They are: President and Professor Shi Yuanchun, Professor An Min, Professor Wang Shu'an, Professor Mao Dalu, and Professor Zeng Shimai of Beijing Agricultural University; Vice President Liu Zhiqing and Researcher Li Jingxiong, Jia Dalin of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences; Director and Senior Agronomist Chen Zongyuan of the Agricultural Technology Promotion Station of the Ministry of Agriculture; Researcher Hu Daofen of the Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences; and Researcher Jia Cuijing of the Beijing Vegetable Research Center.

The experts and professors introduced the current research situation and promotion achievements of China's agricultural economy and development strategy, livestock and aquaculture industry, agricultural technology promotion, water-saving irrigation, hybrid corn promotion, high-yield cultivation of wheat and rice, agricultural biotechnology, plant protection, transformation of medium and low-yield fields in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, and development of vegetable production. They also shared their views on future work. Li Peng listened attentively and took notes on important points.

Li Peng said at the end of the meeting that he appreciated the hard work of the scientific and technological workers in the field of agricultural science and technology, and the valuable opinions of the experts and professors. The discussion was very successful, and everyone's opinions will play an important role in the decision-making of the Party and the government.

Li Peng said that a meeting will be held soon to study the issue of further promoting the application of agricultural scientific and technological achievements. This meeting will first solve the problem of recognition, that is, the revitalization of China's agriculture must rely on science and technology. The application and promotion of agricultural science and technology is still a weak link at present. The urgent task is to promote a batch of scientific and technological achievements that have been proven to be mature, with low investment and high benefits, and to quickly transform them into productive forces to contribute to the revitalization of agriculture.

He said that we need to explore the way out for the application and promotion of scientific and technological achievements and gradually establish a good operating mechanism. On the basis of the existing situation, we need to make the agricultural scientific research institutions and agricultural science and technology promotion stations at all levels from the central to the local levels more vibrant and full of vitality, and become the centers for the promotion of science and technology in rural areas. At the same time, we need to establish different levels, different forms, and different professional farmers' technical organizations on the basis of the household contract responsibility system.

Li Peng finally said that the promotion of science and technology cannot be separated from education and talent. There are so many illiterates in China's rural areas. We need to study how to adapt rural education to the characteristics of rural areas so that students can learn something useful. We need to combine the implementation of the "Liaoyuan," "Fengshou," and "Star" plans to focus on rural education and improve the scientific and cultural quality of the vast number of farmers.

　　农科应用推广仍是薄弱环节    
    李鹏邀请农业专家教授座谈共商解决办法    
    与会者各抒己见将对决策起重要作用
    本报北京５月６日讯  本报记者吴长生、新华社记者黄正根报道：国务院总理李鹏今天上午邀请首都部分农业专家、教授在中南海座谈，共同研究以科学技术成果发展农业问题。
    国务委员陈俊生、国务院秘书长罗干、农业部长何康和首都的数十名农业专家、教授参加了座谈会。
    李鹏同志在座谈会开始时说，当前我国的农业形势严峻，党中央、国务院对农业很关心。要把农业搞上去，一靠政策，二靠科技，三靠投入。到本世纪末我国粮食总产要攀登新的台阶，农业科技需要有一个新的突破。在座的专家、教授有些长期从事科研教学工作，有些长期在农村搞科研和推广工作，有着丰富的经验。
    请诸位来是借此机会与大家交流认识，更主要的是倾听大家关于用科技成果振兴农业的意见。
    在座谈会上发言的专家、教授有１１名，他们是：北京农业大学校长、教授石元春和教授安民、王树安、毛达如、曾士迈，中国农科院副院长刘志澄和研究员李竞雄、贾大林，农业部技术推广站站长、高级农艺师陈宗源，北京市农科院研究员胡道芬，北京市蔬菜研究中心研究员贾翠莹。
    专家、教授们就我国农业经济和发展战略、畜牧水产业、农技推广、节水灌溉、杂交玉米推广、小麦水稻高产栽培、农业生物技术、植物保护、黄淮海地区中低产田改造和发展蔬菜生产等问题，介绍了现在的科研情况、推广成果，并对今后的工作发表了自己的见解。李鹏同志一边细心倾听，重要的还作记录。
    李鹏同志在会议结束时说，感谢广大科技工作者在农业科技战线上的辛勤劳动，感谢各位专家、教授的中肯意见。座谈会开得很好，大家的意见，对党和政府作出重要决策将起重要作用。
    李鹏同志说，最近要开一个会，研究进一步推广应用农业科技成果问题。这个会议要首先解决好认识问题，即振兴我国农业必须依靠科学技术。农业科技的应用与推广工作，仍然是当前薄弱的一环。当务之急是要推广一批各地业经证明成熟了的投资少、效益高的科技成果，使它迅速转化为生产力，为农业的振兴作出贡献。
    他说，要探讨解决科技成果应用与推广的出路，要逐步建立一个好的运行机制。要在现有的基础上，把从中央到地方的各级农业科研机构和农业科技推广站办得更有活力，更富生命力，成为农村科技推广中心。同时，要在家庭联产承包经营的基础上，建立不同层次、不同形式、不同专业的农民技术组织。
    李鹏同志最后说，科技推广离不开教育，离不开人才。我国农村文盲这么多，要研究农村教育如何适应农村特点使学生学了有用。要结合“燎原”、“丰收”、“星火”计划的实施，狠抓农村教育，提高广大农民的科学文化素质。
