On April 1 at 23:30, a long-distance bus from Chengde to Weichang County in Hebei Province, carrying 58 passengers, was robbed by three criminals. Zhao Yunqi, a 49-year-old farmer from Tangtougou Township, Longhua County, grabbed a triangular scraper that had fallen to the ground when the criminals attacked the driver, and engaged in a fierce struggle with the criminals. He stabbed two of the criminals, protecting the passengers' lives and property. The two escaped criminals have since been captured and brought to justice.

Mountain East Detachment's 25-year-old young prisoner Guo Weidong recently received an honorary certificate from Qingdao Branch of the Chinese Correspondence University of Calligraphy and Painting, recognizing him as an outstanding student.

Guo Weidong was sentenced to eight years in prison for theft. In September 1986, he enrolled in the Chinese Correspondence University of Calligraphy and Painting, Qingdao Branch, to study Chinese painting. Last September, his painting "Jingjie" was selected for public exhibition at the Qingdao Navy Club and received positive reviews.
