Nanchang Suburbs Fully Implement Cremation for Funerals

    XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, Nanchang, May 21 -- In the prosperous suburbs of Nanchang, the practice of burying the dead in coffins and building graves has disappeared. Since the implementation of funeral reforms in 1986, all 2,600 deceased farmers in the area have been cremated.

    Nanchang's suburbs are one of the wealthiest counties in Jiangxi, with farmers' per capita net income reaching 839 yuan last year. Before the funeral reforms, the area's villages practiced coffin burials and grave construction, resulting in significant waste. The cremation rate was only 5%. After identifying this issue, the district leadership implemented various measures, including establishing a responsibility system for officials at all levels, dividing tasks, and promoting funeral reforms. Simultaneously, based on actual conditions, funeral reform officers were appointed in each township and village to handle cremation procedures. The district invested over 200,000 yuan to build seven columbaria. Now, handling a funeral typically costs the bereaved family around 100 yuan.

　　南昌市郊区殡葬全部火化
    本报南昌电  如今在富裕起来了的南昌市郊区农村人死棺葬修坟的现象见不到了，从一九八六年推行殡葬改革以来，全区死亡农民二千六百多人，全部实行了火化。
    南昌市郊区是江西最富裕的县区，去年农民人均纯收入达到八百三十九元。在实行殡葬改革之前，这个区里农村死了人搞棺葬、修坟墓，浪费惊人，火化率只占百分之五。郊区领导发现了这个问题后，除了从正面教育外，建立了各级干部责任制，分片包干，搞殡葬改革。同时，根据实际情况，在各乡各村设立殡改员代办丧葬火化手续。全郊区投资二十多万元，建起了七座骨灰堂。现在处理一起丧事，丧家一般花一百来元就可以了。
