Jiangsu Province Nantong City Township Enterprise Bureau recently conducted a survey: last year, the total amount spent by township enterprises in Nantong City on extortion and banquets reached 200 million yuan, accounting for 11.1% of the total profit.

According to a report by the *China Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishery News*, with the rapid development of township industries, some party and government officials and individuals in Nantong City have treated township-run factories as their personal treasure troves and small cash cows. Inspection work inevitably involves feasting, and organizing activities means reaching out for sponsorship fees. In the suburbs, there is a township-run factory with relatively strong economic strength, which spent over 40,000 yuan on such expenses in one year. Some factories have to receive several groups of visitors in a single day, leaving the factory director overwhelmed and bewildered. Some departments and individuals abuse their power, frequently visiting enterprises to take advantage. On weekends, they go to the countryside to fish, not only demanding meals and fishing ponds but also requiring transportation back home, with all expenses covered by the township enterprises. When new products are launched, these individuals are the first to use them for free; when guests arrive, they don't go to restaurants but ask the factory to host, claiming it's their treat but actually the factory's expense. When the enterprise has activities, they rush over no matter how busy they are. During the establishment of an enterprise group by a textile factory in Nantong County, officials from the province, city, county, and township flocked in, causing the number of invited guests to far exceed the original plan. Just the cars alone numbered over 50, forming a long queue. This factory spent tens of thousands of yuan on a single activity.

Nantong City has nearly 300 townships, with banquet expenses reaching over 60 million yuan last year. Some small factories with limited funds cannot withstand repeated extortion and end up in the red; some factories under construction cannot withstand the banquet storm and thus fail to launch.

A responsible person from the Nantong City Township Enterprise Bureau said, "If this bad trend is not curbed, not only will the development of township enterprises face difficulties, but our party's style, public morals, and the overall social atmosphere will also be affected."

　　摊派者伸手　吃喝者张口    
    南通乡镇企业不堪重负    
    去年不合理开支竟达两亿元
    本报讯  江苏省南通市乡镇企业局最近作了一次调查：去年全市乡镇企业用于摊派和吃喝的费用达２亿元，占利润总额的１１．１％。
    据《中国农牧渔业报》披露，随着乡镇工业的迅速发展，南通市一些党政机关和个人把乡镇办工厂当成了自己的聚宝盆和小金库。检查工作少不了要去吃饭，安排活动伸手索取赞助费。郊区有一家经济实力较强的乡办厂，一年用于这方面的开支就有４万多元，有的工厂在一天当中就要接待几批人马，弄得厂长应接不暇，哭笑不得。还有的部门和个人，利用权力，经常到企业去揩油，星期天下乡钓鱼，不但要包吃饭、包渔塘，而且还要包晚上回去有的带，开支均由乡镇企业承担。新产品问世后，这些人首先要免费试用；来了客人，他们不去饭店找厂家，名曰自己请客，实为工厂做东。企业有活动，他们再忙也得赶去。南通县一家绣衣厂组建企业集团，省、市、县、乡各路诸侯蜂拥而至，致使原请的客员大大超出，光汽车就有５０多辆，排起了长龙阵。这家厂一次活动就花去了数万元。
    南通市有近３００个乡镇，去年吃喝费用高达６０００多万元。有的小厂资金单薄，经不起轮番榨取，戴上了亏损的帽子；还有一些在筹建中的工厂，招架不住吃喝风的侵袭，由此夭折。
    南通市乡镇企业局负责人在谈到这些情况时说：“这股歪风不刹住，不仅乡镇企业发展步履艰难，就连我们的党风、民风以及整个社会风气也会受到影响。”
