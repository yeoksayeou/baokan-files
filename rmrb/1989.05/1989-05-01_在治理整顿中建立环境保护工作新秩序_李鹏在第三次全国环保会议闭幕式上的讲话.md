Comrades,

The Third National Environmental Protection Conference is coming to a close today. At a time when the entire Party is focused on rectifying the economic environment, adjusting the economic order, and further deepening reforms, holding such a conference is entirely necessary.

This conference was convened with the approval of the State Council. The Party Central Committee and the State Council have shown great concern for this conference. Before the conference, the State Council specially listened to a report from the National Environmental Protection Bureau. Today, many leading comrades are present. Comrade Song Jian gave a speech at the opening ceremony, which was very good. Comrade Qu Geping, on behalf of the State Council Environmental Committee, delivered an excellent work report. This report summarized the basic experiences of environmental protection work since the Second National Environmental Protection Conference, set the goals that the current government hopes to achieve in environmental protection, proposed future tasks and measures, and clarified the direction of efforts. I hope that after returning, everyone will thoroughly implement the spirit of this conference and continuously advance China's environmental protection cause.

Since the Second National Environmental Protection Conference, five years have passed. It can be said that in the past five years, China's environmental protection work has made some progress. Environmental protection has increasingly become recognized by a wide range of cadres and the masses as one of China's fundamental national policies. The Party Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to environmental protection, treating it as a crucial issue affecting the overall development of the economy and society. Over the past few years, through the joint efforts of governments at all levels and the broad masses of environmental protection workers and the people, the trend of worsening environmental conditions in China has been somewhat alleviated. In other words, without the efforts of the past few years, the situation of environmental pollution would be much more severe. However, it should also be noted that due to population growth and the impact of economic overheating, the environment has come under tremendous pressure, and in many aspects, it has become a factor constraining economic development. We are facing a severe situation of spreading environmental pollution and deteriorating ecological environment. The task of environmental protection is arduous. If we do not pay sufficient attention to controlling pollution and protecting the ecology, and do not make great efforts, the achievements of economic development over the years may be offset by the worsening environmental pollution. In the government work report of the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, I once again emphasized that protecting the environment is one of China's fundamental national policies. During the rectification and reform, we must strengthen the leadership of environmental protection work, take decisive measures, and control the development of environmental pollution.

Next, I will focus on three issues:

First, promoting the coordinated development of the economy and the environment during rectification and reform.

Economic development cannot do without a good social and natural environment. Economic growth and social development not only rely on the progress of science and technology but also depend on the supporting capacity of environmental resources. In the process of economic development, if there are no strong policies and measures to protect the environment, the environment will further deteriorate, leading to delayed or even disrupted economic development. The work report of this conference mentioned an experience: protecting the environment can promote the sustained and stable development of the national economy. Protecting the environment is protecting productivity. This experience is correct. A good ecological environment is the basic condition for economic development. If this basic condition is destroyed, the environment is polluted, and the ecology is deteriorated, it will not only affect economic development but also social stability.

Currently, the central task before us is rectification and reform. Rectification and reform are consistent with the goal of environmental protection. Improving the environmental situation is an important part of rectification and reform. In recent years, due to the impact of economic overheating, some places and departments have blindly launched projects, many of which are high-energy-consuming, low-efficiency, resource-wasting, and heavily polluting projects. One of the goals of our rectification and reform is to adjust the economic, industrial, and product structures, improve enterprise efficiency, and reduce consumption. The State Council recently published the key points of the national industrial policy. This provides a policy basis for controlling pollution and protecting the environment.

During this rectification and reform, the task of the environmental protection department is very heavy, and they must actively cooperate with relevant departments to do a good job in this regard. For some industries and products with high resource and energy consumption, heavy pollution, and low efficiency, economic and administrative measures should be used to implement policies of restricted development and mandatory adjustment. For old enterprises that are heavily polluted and difficult to manage in the short term, technical transformation should be actively carried out in conjunction with rectification, especially for old enterprises located in urban water source protection areas, densely populated areas, scenic spots, and upwind areas of cities. Measures such as closing, stopping, merging, transforming, and relocating should be taken in phases and batches, while strictly restricting the construction of new polluting enterprises in these areas; for small paper mills, small electroplating, small coking, small sintering, small smelting, small sulfur, and other plants with backward production technology, outdated equipment, and serious environmental pollution, they must be restricted and eliminated; for destructive behaviors such as reckless mining and resource destruction, decisive measures must be taken to stop them. We do not approve of short-term behaviors that seek "development" at the expense of the environment.

Rectification and reform are not about comprehensive compression. In the process of adjusting the economic structure, we should concentrate our efforts on developing agriculture, energy, transportation, and raw materials and other basic industries. However, for these industries that should be developed, we must also pay attention to environmental protection. Currently, the environmental pollution of township enterprises is on the rise. Township enterprises should mainly develop the processing of agricultural and sideline products, develop local raw material resources, and provide supporting processing for cities. Those that cause serious pollution and waste resources should be rectified.

Second, establishing a new order for environmental protection work.

In recent years, although our environmental protection work has achieved some results, it is necessary to see that the situation of having laws but not following them and having regulations but not abiding by them is still quite serious, and many aspects still lack laws to rely on. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a new order for environmental protection work.

How to establish a new order for environmental protection work? I think the key is to strengthen institutional construction and strengthen supervision and management. In environmental management, after implementing three effective management systems of environmental impact assessment, "three simultaneities" for construction projects, and pollution discharge fees, various places have created some institutional measures and measures to strengthen management. Such as the environmental protection target responsibility system, quantitative assessment of comprehensive environmental improvement in cities, implementation of pollution discharge permits, promotion of centralized pollution control, and limited-time treatment of pollution sources summarized in this conference, I think they are very good. They should be promoted nationwide and continuously summarized and improved, making them procedural and legalized. Some provinces and cities have taken environmental protection targets as a condition for assessing enterprises and upgrading their levels. Enterprises that cause serious pollution and harm are not allowed to be rated as advanced or upgraded, which promotes pollution treatment and is beneficial to improving product quality and labor efficiency. It is a good method. Please summarize and study it by the State Economic Commission and the State Planning Commission and make corresponding regulations.

We must govern the environment according to law, continuously improve environmental protection regulations, and establish the order of environmental protection work on the basis of the rule of law. Now, China's major policies for environmental protection have been clarified, and a set of regulations and specific policies have been initially formed. Practice has proven that they are in line with reality and national conditions, but they still need to be continuously enriched and improved. Some policies and systems have matured and can be promulgated in the form of legislation. After the regulations are formulated, they must be implemented through strengthened supervision, including mobilizing the masses to supervise, so that they can be implemented. In the future, when the leaders of governments at all levels make decisions and arrange production plans, and when enterprises engage in production activities and operational management, all matters related to the environment must be handled in accordance with environmental protection regulations. Only in this way can we truly establish a new order for environmental protection work.

Third, strengthening the leadership of environmental protection work.

Environmental protection is a very arduous and urgent task. Environmental issues are both economic and social issues, relating to the long-term interests of the people and the country. The Party and the state regard environmental protection as a fundamental national policy, fully demonstrating the high attention paid to this work. Leaders at all levels must fully recognize the significance of this fundamental national policy and truly place environmental protection work in an important position. The main responsible comrades of governments at all levels should propose environmental protection responsibility targets during their term of office, do several practical things for the people, and take responsibility and make contributions to improving the environmental quality of their regions and departments. Of course, these targets should be practical and achievable, and should not set unrealistic high targets. The environmental quality of a region is a comprehensive reflection of its economic and social development. Governors, mayors, county magistrates, and township heads must all be responsible for the environmental quality of their regions. Practice has proven that as long as the main leaders of the government attach importance to environmental protection work and personally oversee environmental management and environmental construction, the situation of environmental deterioration will gradually ease, and economic development will also be effective. On the contrary, if environmental protection is not paid attention to, environmental pollution will continue to develop and even become difficult to reverse, and economic construction will also be difficult to proceed smoothly.

To do a good job in environmental protection, we must pay great attention to the organizational and institutional construction of the environmental protection department. China is a developing country, and its economic strength is not strong, so it is not possible to spend a lot of money on environmental treatment. An active approach is to strengthen environmental management and control the trend of environmental deterioration through management. Environmental protection agencies at all levels are functional agencies of governments at all levels and should be equipped with necessary personnel to enable them to independently exercise supervision and management powers. Governments at all levels should also actively support the work of environmental protection departments and stand behind them. An important task of environmental protection departments at all levels is to strengthen their own team building and improve the quality of personnel.

We must strengthen the publicity and education of environmental protection, improve the environmental awareness of the whole nation, and especially improve the environmental awareness of leaders at all levels. At present, many cadres and the masses still lack sufficient understanding of the importance of environmental protection. Environmental protection laws and policies have not been well implemented. Among some leading cadres, the phenomenon of "talking about the importance of environmental protection but not doing it" still exists. Here, an important reason is still insufficient publicity and education, and low awareness. Therefore, we must strengthen the publicity and education of environmental protection, so that leaders at all levels and the broad masses can truly understand why protecting the environment is a fundamental national policy, understand why the economy and the environment should be coordinated, and fully understand the position and role of environmental protection in rectification and reform. We must regard environmental protection as an important part of spiritual civilization construction, educate the masses to consciously protect the environment, and regard it as a social virtue. Governments at all levels should regularly publish the environmental quality status of their localities to the public, strengthen public opinion supervision, and strengthen public supervision. Those who should be praised should be praised, and those who should be criticized should be criticized.

Comrades, although we face many difficulties, as long as we have full confidence, work hard, and make arduous efforts, I believe that the environmental protection targets set by this conference will definitely be achieved, and China's environmental situation will gradually improve.

### 在治理整顿中建立环境保护工作新秩序——李鹏在第三次全国环保会议闭幕式上的讲话

　　在治理整顿中建立环境保护工作新秩序   
    ——李鹏在第三次全国环保会议闭幕式上的讲话
    同志们：
    第三次全国环境保护会议，今天就要闭幕了。在全党一心一意治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、进一步深化改革的时候，召开这样一次会议是完全必要的。
    这次会议是由国务院批准召开的。党中央、国务院对这次会议很关心，会前，国务院专门听取了国家环境保护局的汇报。今天，许多领导同志都到了会。宋健同志在开幕式上讲了话，讲得很好。曲格平同志代表国务院环委会作的工作报告也很好。这个报告总结了第二次全国环境保护会议以来环境保护工作的基本经验，制定了本届政府在环境保护工作上希望达到的目标，提出了今后的任务和措施，明确了努力方向。希望大家回去以后很好地贯彻落实这次会议的精神，把我国的环境保护事业不断推向前进。
    第二次全国环境保护会议以来，已经有五年了。应该说这五年我国的环境保护工作有了一定的进展，保护环境作为我国的一项基本国策，越来越为广大干部和群众所认识。党中央、国务院是很重视环境保护的，把它作为关系经济发展和社会发展全局的重要问题来抓。这几年来，经过各级政府和广大环境保护工作者及人民群众的共同努力，我国环境状况恶化的趋势有所减缓。也就是说，要是没有前几年的努力工作，环境污染状况要比现在严重得多。但是也应该看到，由于人口的增加，经济过热的影响，对环境造成了巨大压力，在许多方面已经成为制约经济发展的因素之一。我们面临环境污染蔓延和生态环境恶化的形势是严峻的。环境保护的任务是艰巨的。如果我们不在控制污染、保护生态方面给予足够的重视，不付出极大的努力，那么多年来经济发展所取得的成果，很可能被日益恶化的环境污染所抵销。我在七届人大二次会议的《政府工作报告》中再次强调，保护环境是我国的一项基本国策。在治理整顿中，要切实加强环境保护工作的领导，采取坚决措施，控制环境污染的发展。
    下面，我着重讲三个问题：
    一、在治理整顿、深化改革中，促进经济与环境的协调发展
    经济的发展，离不开良好的社会环境和自然环境。经济的增长，社会的发展，不仅依赖于科学技术的进步，还取决于环境资源的支撑能力。在发展经济中，如果没有强有力的保护环境的政策和措施，就会使环境进一步的恶化，从而导致延缓、甚至破坏经济的顺利发展。这次会议的工作报告中讲了一条体会，就是保护环境能促进国民经济持续、稳定地发展，保护环境就是保护生产力。这个体会是很对的。良好的生态环境，是经济发展的基础条件。如果这个基础条件破坏了，环境污染了，生态恶化了，不仅影响经济的发展，也影响社会的安定。
    当前，摆在我们面前的中心任务是，治理整顿和深化改革。治理整顿与保护环境目标是一致的。改善环境状况是治理整顿的一个重要组成部分。这几年，由于经济过热的影响，一些地方和部门盲目上项目，其中有不少是耗能高、效率低、浪费资源、污染严重的项目。我们进行治理整顿的目标之一，就是调整经济结构、产业结构和产品结构，提高企业效益，降低消耗。国务院最近公布了国家的产业政策要点。这为控制污染、保护环境提供了政策依据。
    这次治理整顿中，环境保护部门的任务是很重的，要积极配合有关部门做好这项工作。对一些资源能源消耗大、污染重、效益低的产业和产品，要依法运用经济和行政的手段，实行限制发展和强制调整的政策。对那些污染严重一时又难以治理的老企业，应当结合技术改造积极进行治理。特别是对那些位于城市水源保护区、人口稠密区、风景名胜区、城市上风向的老企业，应当分期分批采取关、停、并、转、迁的措施，同时严格限制在这些地区新建有污染的企业；对那些生产技术落后、设备陈旧、严重污染环境的小造纸、小电镀、小炼焦、小烧结、小冶炼、小硫磺等厂点，必须实行限制和淘汰；对那些毁灭性的滥采乱挖、破坏资源的行为，必须采取坚决措施加以制止。对那种以牺牲环境求“发展”的短期行为，我们是不赞成的。
    治理整顿不是全面压缩。在调整经济结构中，要集中力量发展农业，发展能源、交通和原材料等基础产业。但是，对这些应发展的行业，也必须注意环境保护。当前，乡镇企业的环境污染有加剧的趋势。乡镇企业应当主要发展农副产品加工，开发当地原材料资源和为城市配套加工，凡是污染严重、浪费资源的应当加以整顿。
    　　　　二、建立环境保护工作的新秩序
    这几年我们的环境保护工作虽然取得一定的成绩，但是要看到有法不依、有章不循的情况还比较严重，许多方面还无法可依。因此有必要建立环境保护工作的新秩序。
    怎么建立环境保护工作新秩序呢？我认为，中心就是要加强制度建设，强化监督管理。在环境管理上，继实行了环境影响评价、建设项目“三同时”和排污收费等三项行之有效的管理制度之后，各地又创造了一些强化管理的制度和措施。像这次会议总结的环境保护目标责任制、城市环境综合整治定量考核、实行污染物排放许可证、促进污染集中控制、对污染源实行限期治理等制度和措施，我认为就很好。应当在全国推行，并不断总结完善，使其程序化、法制化。有些省、市把环境保护目标作为考核企业和企业上等级的一个条件，凡是污染严重、造成危害的企业，一律不能评为先进、上等级，这就促进了污染的治理，有利于提高产品质量和劳动效率，是一个好办法。请国家体改委和国家计委加以总结研究，做出相应的规定。
    要依法治理环境，不断完善环境保护的法规，把环境保护工作秩序建立在法制的基础之上。现在，我国环境保护的大政方针已经明确了，也初步形成了一套法规和具体政策。实践证明，它们是符合实际、符合国情的，但还需要不断充实和完善。一些政策、制度成熟了，可以用立法的形式加以颁布。法规制定之后，就要通过强化监督，包括发动群众进行监督，使之得以实施。今后，各级政府领导在进行决策和安排生产计划时，各企业在生产活动和经营管理中，凡是涉及环境问题，都要依照环保法规办事。只有这样，才能真正建立起环境保护工作新秩序。
    　　　　三、切实加强对环境保护工作的领导
    环境保护是一项十分艰巨、紧迫的任务。环境问题，既是经济问题又是社会问题，关系到人民和国家的长远利益。党和国家把保护环境作为一项基本国策，充分表明了对这项工作的高度重视。各级领导要充分认识这项基本国策的意义，切切实实地把环境保护工作放到重要位置上来。各级政府的主要负责人要在自己的任期内，提出环境保护的责任目标，为群众多办几件实实在在的实事，为改善本地区、本部门的环境质量尽到责任、做出贡献。当然，这些目标应当是实事求是、力所能及的，不要提那些不切实际的高指标。一个地区的环境质量如何，是这个地区经济、社会发展的综合体现。省长、市长、县长、乡长，都要对本地区的环境质量负责。实践证明，凡是政府的主要领导重视环保工作，亲自过问环境管理和环境建设，环境恶化状况就逐步减轻，经济发展也富有成效。反之，不注意保护环境，环境污染就会日益发展甚至积重难返，经济建设也难以顺利进行。
    搞好环境保护要十分重视环境保护部门的组织建设和机构建设。我国是发展中国家，经济实力还不强，不可能拿出很多的钱用于环境治理。积极的办法是加强环境管理，通过管理去控制环境恶化的趋势。各级环境保护机构是各级政府的职能机构，应当配备必要的人员，使它能够独立行使监督管理的权力。各级政府还要积极支持环保部门的工作，为他们撑腰。各级环保部门的一个重要任务是要抓好自己的队伍建设，提高人员素质。
    要加强环境保护的宣传教育，提高全民族的环境意识，特别要提高各级领导的环境意识。现在，不少干部和群众，对环境保护的重要意义还缺乏足够的认识。环保法规和政策，并没有很好地执行。在一些领导干部中，环保工作“说起来重要，做起来不要”的现象还是存在的。这里，一个重要的原因还是宣传教育不够，认识不高。所以，要大力加强环境保护的宣传教育，使各级领导和广大群众真正搞清楚为什么保护环境是一项基本国策，搞清楚经济和环境为什么要协调发展，充分认识保护环境在治理整顿中的地位和作用。要把环境保护作为精神文明建设的一个重要组成部分来抓，教育广大群众自觉地保护环境，把它看作是一项社会公德。各级政府要定期向群众公布当地的环境质量状况，加强舆论监督，加强群众监督。该表扬的表扬，该批评的批评。
    同志们，尽管我们面临的困难很多，但是，只要我们树立充分信心，扎扎实实地工作，付出艰苦的努力，我相信，这次会议制定的环境保护目标一定能够实现，我国的环境状况一定会逐步有所改善。
