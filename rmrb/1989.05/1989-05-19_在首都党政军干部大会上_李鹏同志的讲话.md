		Speech by Comrade Li Peng at the Meeting of Party, Government, and Military Cadres in the Capital

	Comrades!

	Today, in accordance with the decision of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Party Central Committee and the State Council convened a meeting of central and Beijing municipal party, government, and military cadres. The meeting calls on everyone to mobilize urgently and take resolute and effective measures to clearly oppose the turmoil, restore social order, maintain stability and unity, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization.

	Just now, the responsible comrades of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC reported that the current situation in the capital is quite severe. The state of anarchy is becoming more serious, and the rule of law and discipline are being undermined. Originally, by early May, after a great deal of work, the situation had begun to stabilize. However, since entering May, the turmoil has intensified. More and more students and other masses are participating in parades and demonstrations. Many colleges and universities are paralyzed, public transportation is blocked everywhere, party and government leadership organs are under attack, social order is deteriorating, and the normal production, work, study, and life of the people of the entire city are seriously disrupted. Some state activities scheduled in the highly anticipated Sino-Soviet high-level meeting have been forced to change or cancel, severely damaging China's international image and reputation.

	The hunger strike and petition activities of some students in Tiananmen Square are still ongoing. Their health has been severely affected, and some are in danger. In reality, a few people are using the hunger-striking students as "hostages" to blackmail and force the Party and the government to accept their political conditions, completely disregarding even the most basic humanitarianism. The Party and the government, on the one hand, have taken all possible measures to treat and rescue the hunger-striking students; on the other hand, they have had multiple dialogues with representatives of the hunger-striking students and solemnly stated that they will continue to listen to their opinions in the future, hoping that they will immediately stop the hunger strike. However, these efforts have not achieved the expected results. In the crowded situation in Tiananmen Square, with inflammatory slogans and highly excited emotions, the representatives of the hunger-striking students also expressed that they can no longer control the situation. Now, if we do not quickly end this situation and allow it to continue, it is hard to predict that we will not see a situation that no one wants to see.

	The situation in Beijing is still developing and has already spread to many cities across the country. In many places, the number of people participating in parades and demonstrations is increasing. In some places, there have been multiple incidents of attacking local party and government leadership organs, and serious illegal and destructive activities such as beating, smashing, looting, and burning. Recently, even trains on major rail lines have been intercepted, causing traffic to be forced to stop. All these situations indicate that if the situation is not quickly reversed and stabilized, it will lead to turmoil across the country. Our country's reform and opening up and the Four Modernizations, the future and destiny of the People's Republic, are already facing serious threats.

	Our Party and government have repeatedly said that the hearts of the vast majority of young students are good, and they do not intend to create turmoil subjectively. They have patriotic enthusiasm and hope to promote democracy and rectify corruption, which is consistent with the goals that the Party and government strive to achieve. Some of the problems and opinions they raise have already played a positive role in improving the work of the Party and government. However, taking arbitrary actions such as parades, demonstrations, strikes, and hunger strikes to petition, disrupting social stability, not only does not help solve problems but also the development of the situation has completely deviated from the subjective wishes of the young students, and is increasingly moving in the opposite direction of their wishes.

	It is now increasingly clear that a very small number of people want to achieve their political goals through turmoil, which is to negate the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. They openly raise the banner of negating and opposing bourgeois liberalization, aiming to gain absolute freedom to oppose the Four Cardinal Principles without restraint. They have spread a large number of rumors, attacking, slandering, and cursing the main leaders of the Party and the state. Now they have concentrated their attacks on Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who has made tremendous contributions to our reform and opening-up cause, with the purpose of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China organizationally, overthrowing the people's government produced by the National People's Congress in accordance with the law, and completely negating the people's democratic dictatorship; they are stirring up trouble everywhere, secretly connecting, and inciting the establishment of various illegal organizations, forcing the Party and the government to recognize them, in order to lay the foundation for them to establish an opposition and opposition party in China. If their goals are achieved, reform and opening up, democracy and the rule of law, and socialist modernization construction will all become bubbles, and China will experience a historical setback. A very promising and hopeful China will become a China without hope and future.

	Therefore, we must clearly oppose the turmoil and expose the political conspiracies of a very small number of people, an important purpose of which is to distinguish the vast majority of young students from those who instigate the turmoil, out of concern for the young students. In the past period, our handling of the student movement has been extremely tolerant and restrained, precisely out of such wishes and purposes, to avoid hurting good people, especially young students. However, those who are behind the scenes planning and inciting the turmoil think that the Party and the government are weak and can be bullied, constantly creating rumors, deceiving the masses, expanding the situation, and making the situation in the capital and many places across the country increasingly severe, forcing us to take decisive and resolute measures to stop the turmoil.

	It must be emphasized that even in this situation, we must still insist on protecting the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast majority of young students and strictly distinguish them from the very small number of people who create turmoil. Not only that, the dialogues between the Party and government and the broad masses of students and people from all walks of life, including those who have participated in parades, demonstrations, strikes, and hunger strikes, will continue to be conducted extensively and actively through various levels, channels, and forms, to fully listen to the opinions of all parties. For the reasonable demands raised by the students, we will give clear answers; for their reasonable criticisms and suggestions, such as punishing officials who have engaged in corrupt practices, eliminating corruption, and overcoming bureaucratism, we will seriously listen to and adopt them, to improve the work of the Party and the government.

	During this period, under very complex conditions, many school leaders, teachers, and students have done a great deal of extremely arduous work to persuade against parades and demonstrations and maintain the teaching order of the school; the vast majority of public security personnel and armed police have made great contributions to maintaining traffic order, social order, and social security under extremely difficult conditions; the staff of various departments, factories, shops, and enterprises have insisted on production and work, making arduous efforts for the normal operation of social life. The Party and the government are grateful to you all, and the people will not forget you!

	Now, to resolutely stop the turmoil and quickly restore order, I hereby appeal on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council:

	First, students who are still on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, we hope you will immediately stop the hunger strike, leave the square, receive treatment, and quickly recover your health.

	Second, students and people from all walks of life, we hope you will immediately stop all parade activities and, out of humanitarianism, no longer "support" the hunger-striking students. No matter what the motivation, further "support" will push them to the brink.

	Comrades! At today's meeting, I also, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, call on the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to unite as one, work together, and take immediate action to contribute to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation at your respective posts.

	All levels of party organizations must unite the masses, do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, and play a core leadership and fighting fortress role in stabilizing the situation;

	All Communist Party members must strictly abide by party discipline, not only not participate in any activities that harm stability and unity but also play a vanguard and model role in uniting the masses and stopping the turmoil;

	All levels of government must seriously enforce political discipline and law and order, strengthen leadership and management of their respective regions and units, and seriously grasp the stabilization of the situation and various reform and construction work;

	All state organ staff must stay at their posts, be loyal to their duties, and maintain normal work order;

	All public security personnel and armed police must further strive to maintain traffic order, social order, strengthen social security, and resolutely crack down on various illegal and criminal activities;

	All industrial and commercial enterprises and public institutions must abide by labor discipline and insist on normal production order;

	All levels and types of schools must insist on normal teaching order, and those who have stopped classes should resume classes unconditionally.

	Comrades!

	Our Party is the ruling party, and our government is the people's government. To be responsible to our sacred motherland and to all the people, we must take resolute and decisive measures to quickly end the turmoil, maintain the leadership of the Party, and maintain the socialist system. We believe that this will definitely receive the support and approval of all Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, workers, peasants, intellectuals, democratic parties, people from all walks of life, and the broad masses. It will also definitely receive the support and approval of the People's Liberation Army, which is entrusted by the Constitution with the glorious task of defending the motherland and defending the peaceful labor of the people. At the same time, we also hope that the broad masses of the people will give full support to the efforts of the People's Liberation Army and the armed police to maintain the normal order of the capital.

	Comrades!

	We must, under the condition of resolutely maintaining stability and unity, continue to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, strengthen democratic and legal system construction, strive to eliminate various corrupt phenomena, and strive to promote the socialist modernization cause!

### 在首都党政军干部大会上  李鹏同志的讲话

　　在首都党政军干部大会上    
    李鹏同志的讲话
    同志们！
    今天，根据中共中央政治局常务委员会的决定，党中央和国务院召开中央和北京市党政军干部大会，要求大家紧急动员起来，采取坚决有力的措施，旗帜鲜明地制止动乱，恢复社会正常秩序，维护安定团结，以保证改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行。
    刚才中共北京市委负责同志介绍的情况说明，当前首都形势相当严峻。无政府状态越来越严重，法制和纪律遭到破坏。本来，５月初以前，经过大量的工作，形势已趋于平稳，但进入５月以后，又更加动乱起来。卷入游行示威的学生和其他群众越来越多，许多高等学校陷于瘫痪，公共交通到处堵塞，党政领导机关受到冲击，社会治安恶化，严重干扰和破坏了全市人民的生产、工作、学习和生活的正常秩序。举世瞩目的中苏高级会晤中的一些国事活动安排，也因此而被迫变更或取消，极大地损害了我国的国际形象和声誉。
    天安门广场部分学生绝食请愿的活动还在继续。他们的健康已经受到极大的损害，有的人生命已处于危险之中。实际上这是少数人拿绝食同学作为“人质”，要挟、强迫党和政府答应他们的政治条件，连一点点起码的人道主义都不讲了。党和政府一方面采取了一切可能采取的措施，对绝食学生进行治疗和抢救；另一方面，多次同绝食学生的代表进行对话，并郑重表示今后将继续听取他们的意见，希望立即停止绝食，但都未能取得预期效果。在天安门广场人群拥挤，煽动性口号不断和人群情绪极度激动的情况下，绝食学生代表也表示，他们已不能控制局势。现在，我们如果再不迅速结束这种状况，听任其发展下去，很难预料不出现大家都不愿意看到的情况。
    北京的事态还在发展，而且已经波及到了全国许多城市。在不少地方，游行示威的人越来越多。在有的地方，也发生了多次冲击当地党政领导机关的事件，发生了打、砸、抢、烧等严重违法破坏活动。最近，甚至铁路干线上的火车也遭到拦截，使交通被迫中断。种种情况表明，如再不迅速扭转局面，稳定局势，就会导致全国范围的大动乱。我们国家的改革开放和四化建设，人民共和国的前途和命运，已经面临严重的威胁。
    我们的党和政府多次说过，广大青年学生的心灵是善良的，他们在主观愿望上是不想搞动乱的。他们有爱国热情，希望促进民主，整治腐败，这同党和政府要努力实现的目标是一致的。他们提出的一些问题和意见，已经对改进党和政府的工作起到积极作用。但是，任意采取游行、示威、罢课乃至绝食请愿等方式，破坏了社会稳定，不仅不利于问题的解决，而且事态的发展已经完全不以青年学生们的主观愿望为转移，正在越来越走向他们愿望的反面。
    现在已经越来越清楚地看出，极少数极少数的人要通过动乱达到他们的政治目的，这就是否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。他们公开打出否定反对资产阶级自由化的口号，目的就是要取得肆无忌惮地反对四项基本原则的绝对自由。他们散布了大量谣言，攻击、污蔑、谩骂党和国家主要领导人，现在已经集中地把矛头指向为我们改革、开放事业做出了巨大贡献的邓小平同志，其目的就是要从组织上颠覆中国共产党的领导，推翻经过人民代表大会依法产生的人民政府，彻底否定人民民主专政；他们四出煽风点火，秘密串连，鼓动成立各种非法组织，强迫党和政府承认，就是要为他们在中国建立反对派、反对党打下基础。如果他们的目的得逞，什么改革开放，什么民主法制，什么社会主义现代化建设，都将成为泡影，中国将出现一次历史的倒退。一个很有希望很有前途的中国，就会变成没有希望没有前途的中国。
    我们所以旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，揭露极少数人的政治阴谋，一个重要的目的，就是要把广大青年学生同挑动动乱的极少数人区分开来，是出于对青年学生的爱护。前一段，我们在处理学潮问题上所以采取极其宽容、克制的态度，也正是出于这样的愿望和目的，不要伤害好人，特别不要伤害青年学生。而那些躲在背后策划和煽动动乱的极少数人，却以为党和政府软弱可欺，不断制造谣言，蛊惑群众，扩大事态，导致首都乃至全国许多地方的形势发展得越来越严峻，迫使我们不得不采取果断、坚决的措施来制止动乱。
    必须强调，即使在这样的情况下，我们仍然要坚持保护广大青年学生的爱国热情，把他们同制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来，对他们在学潮中的过激言行不予追究。不但如此，党和政府同广大学生和各界人士之间的对话，包括同参加过游行、示威、罢课、绝食的学生之间的对话，还将通过多种层次、多种渠道和多种形式广泛积极地进行，以充分听取各方面的意见。对学生们提出的合理要求，我们将给予明确的答复，对他们提出的合理批评和建议，如惩治官倒、消除腐败、克服官僚主义，我们将认真听取和采纳，以切实改进党和政府的工作。
    在这段时间里，在十分复杂的情况下，许多学校的负责同志、广大教师和同学们，为劝阻游行示威、维护学校的教学秩序，做了大量的极其艰苦的工作；广大公安干警和武装警察在极端困难的条件下，为维护交通秩序、社会秩序和社会治安，作出了很大贡献；机关、工厂、商店和企事业单位的干部、职工，坚持生产，坚持工作，为社会生活的正常运转付出了艰苦的劳动。对这一切，党和政府是感谢你们的，人民是不会忘记你们的！
    现在，为了坚决制止动乱，迅速恢复秩序，我在这里代表党中央和国务院紧急呼吁：
    一、目前还在天安门广场绝食的学生，希望你们立即停止绝食，离开广场，接受治疗，尽快恢复健康。
    二、广大同学和社会各界，希望你们立即停止一切游行活动，并从人道主义出发，再也不要对绝食学生进行所谓的“声援”了。不管动机如何，再搞“声援”就是把他们推向绝路。
    同志们！在今天的大会上，我还要代表党中央和国务院，号召全党全军全国各族人民，和衷共济，团结一致，立即行动起来，在各自的岗位上为制止动乱和稳定局势做出贡献。
    各级党组织必须团结广大群众，做好深入细致的思想政治工作，在稳定局势中充分发挥核心领导和战斗堡垒作用；
    全体共产党员必须严格遵守党的纪律，不仅不参与任何损害安定团结的活动，而且要在团结群众、制止动乱中发挥先锋模范作用；
    各级政府必须严肃政纪法纪，切实加强对所属地区和单位的领导和管理，认真抓好稳定局势以及各项改革和建设工作；
    全体国家机关工作人员必须坚守岗位，忠于职守，维护正常的工作秩序；
    全体公安干警和武装警察要进一步努力维护交通秩序、社会秩序，强化社会治安，坚决打击各种违法犯罪活动；
    所有工商企业和事业单位都要遵守劳动纪律，坚持进行正常的生产秩序；
    各级各类学校都要坚持正常的教学秩序，凡罢课的应一律无条件地复课。
    同志们！
    我们的党是执政党，我们的政府是人民的政府。为了对神圣的祖国负责，对全体人民负责，我们必须采取坚决果断的措施，迅速结束动乱，维护党的领导，维护社会主义制度。我们这样做，相信一定会得到全体共产党员、共青团员、工人、农民、知识分子、民主党派、各界人士和广大群众的支持和拥护，一定会得到肩负着宪法赋予的保卫祖国、保卫人民和平劳动的光荣任务的人民解放军的支持和拥护。同时我们也希望广大人民群众对人民解放军和武警部队干警为维护首都正常秩序所做的努力给予全力支持。
    同志们！
    我们一定要在坚决维护安定团结的条件下，继续坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，加强民主和法制建设，努力清除各种腐败现象，为把社会主义现代化事业不断推向前进而努力奋斗！
