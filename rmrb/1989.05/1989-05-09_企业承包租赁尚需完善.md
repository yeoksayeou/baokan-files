Column: Investigation and Reflection

Recently, the county's bureau of industry and commerce conducted a spot check of 174 enterprises that had implemented contracting and leasing, focusing on the signing of contracts and their fulfillment. Five types of deficiencies were discovered, indicating a need for further improvement.

Firstly, the contracts lack necessary clauses. For instance, 36% of the contracts do not specify the handling of debts and liabilities prior to contracting or leasing, leaving original creditors with no recourse for debt collection. Additionally, the responsibilities of the operators are not clearly defined in the contracts, with 76% of the contracts lacking provisions for risk responsibilities.

Secondly, some contracts deviate from the principles of voluntariness and fairness. Two contractors from the Longyang grain and materials system complained that the contracts impose numerous hard targets on them, some of which are unrealistic, while the contracting parties have no obligations to fulfill. They are now applying to relevant departments to modify or terminate the contracts.

Thirdly, some contracting parties have not rigorously vetted the qualifications of the contractors or lessees, leading to blind agreements and occasional fraud incidents. The Pengjiahe Wine Factory in Gaojian Town publicly solicited bids, and an outsider, Wang Bangcheng, leased the factory with a deposit of 500 yuan, signing a five-year leasing and operating contract with the town's economic commission. Later, Wang Bangcheng used the pretext of expanding the factory's production to raise funds from various sources, only to abscond with several thousand yuan.

Fourthly, the supervising departments of the contracting parties treat enterprise contracting and leasing as a way to offload burdens, failing to conduct serious supervision and inspection. They only pursue the goal of remitting profits, leading some contracted or leased enterprises to overuse equipment and consume excessively, damaging the enterprise's "vitality."

Fifthly, some contracted or leased enterprises have chaotic financial management. Some contractors or lessees, in pursuit of high bonuses, deceive their superiors and subordinates, falsely reporting and embezzling funds.

Implementing contracting and leasing for enterprise operations is an effective measure to enhance enterprise vitality. It is hoped that relevant departments will continue to summarize experiences in practice, address deficiencies, and ensure the smooth progress of enterprise reform.

### 企业承包租赁尚需完善

　　企业承包租赁尚需完善
    最近，我县工商局抽查了１７４家实行承包、租赁企业签订合同和履约的情况，发现存在５种缺陷，还须进一步完善。
    一是合同的签订缺少必要条款。如有３６％的合同对承包和租赁前的债权债务处理没有规定，致使原债权人讨债无门，索债无主。另外，经营者的责任在合同中也不够明确，有７６％的合同没有风险责任规定。
    二是一些合同的签订偏离自愿、公平的原则。长阳粮食、物资系统的两名承包人反映，合同中要求他们履约的硬指标多，而且有的脱离实际，但发包方无需履行任何义务。现在他们正申请有关部门变更或终止合同。
    三是一些发包方没有严格审查承包租赁者的资格，盲目签约，导致少数不法分子诈骗的事件时有发生。高家堰镇彭家河酒厂向社会公开招标，外来人员王邦承以５００元抵押金承租这个酒厂，与镇经委签订了为期５年的租赁经营合同。后来，王邦承以扩大酒厂生产为名，多方集资，随后携款数千元逃之夭夭。
    四是发包方的主管部门把企业承包租赁视作卸包袱，不认真监督检查，只片面追求上交利润，造成部分承包租赁企业拚设备、拚消耗，伤害企业“元气”。
    五是有的承包租赁企业的财务管理混乱。一些承包租赁者为追求高额奖金，欺上瞒下，虚报冒领。
    企业实行承包租赁经营是增强企业活力的有效措施。希望有关部门在实践中不断总结经验，克服缺陷，以保证企业深化改革的顺利进行。
