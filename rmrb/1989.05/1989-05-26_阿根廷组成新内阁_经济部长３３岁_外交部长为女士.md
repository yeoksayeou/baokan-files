Argentina's new cabinet was announced on May 25th. In the new cabinet, which consists of 9 members, 4 members from the previous cabinet retained their positions, while 5 ministers, including those in charge of economics, interior affairs, and foreign affairs, were replaced.

Notably, the new cabinet includes Jesus Rodriguez, a 33-year-old economist, who will serve as the Minister of Economy, and Susana Ruiz Cerutti, who will be the Minister of Foreign Affairs, marking the first time in Argentine history that a woman has held the position of minister.

In recent years, Argentina's economy has faced significant difficulties.

Recently, President Alfonsín expressed his intention to hand over power to the elected president, Carlos Menem, five months earlier than scheduled, on July 10th, to allow Menem to formulate new economic policies promptly. However, this proposal was rejected. Alfonsín's attempt to reach an agreement with Menem on economic policies during the transition period also failed. Under these circumstances, all cabinet members resigned on May 23rd.

　　阿根廷组成新内阁
    经济部长３３岁　外交部长为女士
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯５月２５日电  阿根廷新内阁２５日宣布组成。在由９名成员组成的新内阁中，４名原内阁成员留任，经济、内政和外交等５名部长易人。
    新内阁成员中引人注目的是，年仅３３岁的经济学硕士赫苏斯·罗德里格斯担任经济部长、苏珊娜·鲁伊斯·塞鲁蒂女士任外交部长，这是阿根廷有史以来第一位女部长。
    近年来，阿根廷经济十分困难。
    日前，阿方辛总统表示将提前５个月于７月１０日把政权交给当选总统梅内姆以便于他早日制订新的经济政策，但遭到拒绝。阿方辛总统试图与梅内姆就过渡时期的经济政策达成一项协议，也遭到失败。在这种情况下，全体内阁成员于５月２３日向阿方辛总统提出辞职。
