On the third day since the State Council issued the order for martial law in Beijing, the atmosphere in the city has eased, with most citizens remaining calm.

The People's Liberation Army units tasked with enforcing martial law are still stationed in the outskirts of the city. Some students and citizens have brought food and drinks to the soldiers, engaging in warm and sincere conversations, creating a harmonious atmosphere. The martial law troops have been widely educated on "loving Beijing, loving the people of Beijing, and loving the students." Some soldiers have expressed to the students and citizens: "The people's army loves the people."

Today, the entire Tiananmen Square is relatively quiet. The number of people on the square has decreased, but students are still sitting in protest. The sanitation conditions on the square are poor. Some university students have assisted sanitation workers in cleaning up garbage and spraying disinfectant to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

In the afternoon, some people took to the streets to protest, but the number was significantly smaller than in previous days.

It is understood that the five urban and suburban districts of Beijing—Dongcheng, Xicheng, Haidian, Chongwen, and Xuanwu—have formed a "Capital People's Order Maintenance Team" of over 70,000 people. They have started clearing roadblocks, directing traffic, and maintaining order in various areas since this afternoon. According to a responsible person from the Beijing Public Transportation Corporation, out of the city's 172 bus routes, 66 routes have resumed full or partial service. Other routes and the subway are still not operational, and many traffic checkpoints are not yet under the control of traffic police.

Beijing's commercial workers have continued to go to work, shops have reopened, and citizens' daily lives have returned to normal. Various cinemas and theaters have resumed their entertainment activities.

According to a responsible person from Beijing Railway Station, the number of students coming to Beijing from other provinces by train has significantly decreased. Students who came to Beijing in the past few days have started to return.

　　北京城区昨天气氛趋于缓和
    戒严部队仍在城郊附近军民相互热情恳谈
    天安门广场人数有所减少学生仍在静坐外地学生开始返回
    新华社北京５月２２日电  在国务院关于北京地区实行戒严的命令下达的第三天，北京城区的气氛趋于缓和，多数市民表现沉着。
    执行戒严任务的解放军部队，今天仍在北京城郊附近。一些大学生和市民向解放军官兵送食品和饮料，相互热情恳谈，气氛融洽。戒严部队普遍进行了“热爱北京城，热爱北京人民，热爱青年学生”的教育。一些解放军官兵向学生和市民表示：人民军队爱人民。
    今天，整个天安门广场比较平静。广场上的人数有所减少，学生仍在静坐。广场的卫生状况不佳。一些大学生协助环卫工人清除垃圾，喷洒消毒药水，防止传染病流行。
    下午，有人上街游行，但人数比前几天要少得多。
    据了解，北京东城、西城、海淀、崇文、宣武五个城近郊区已组成７万多人的“首都群众维护秩序工作队”，并于今日下午分赴一些地段清理路障，疏导交通，维持秩序。据北京市公共交通总公司负责人介绍，全市１７２条公共电汽车线路中，已有６６条全程或区段恢复行驶，其他线路和地铁仍未开通，多处交通岗尚未由交通民警指挥。
    北京的商业职工坚持上班，店铺照常营业，市民生活秩序大体正常，各大影剧院的文娱活动照常进行。
    据北京火车站负责人介绍，从外地乘火车来京的学生明显减少，前几天来京的外地学生已开始陆续返回。
