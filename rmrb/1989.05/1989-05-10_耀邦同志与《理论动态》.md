Comrade Hu Yaobang and "Theoretical Trends"

    I remember that in the latter half of 1978, when the discussion on the criterion of truth had just begun, Comrade Hu Yaobang, in a conversation with members of the "Theoretical Trends Group," said with deep emotion, "After I die, I want it to be recorded that during my lifetime, I published 'Theoretical Trends.' Comrade Hu Yaobang made significant contributions to the Party and the people in many aspects. When he was in charge of the Central Party School, he personally initiated the publication of the internal journal "Theoretical Trends," which is one of his important contributions.

    Comrade Hu Yaobang took over the work at the Central Party School in March 1977, after the Gang of Four was smashed. At that time, under the constraints of the "two whatevers" policy, people's thinking was still in a state of rigidity. Comrade Hu Yaobang deeply felt that it was an urgent and important task to correct the distorted ideologies, theories, and lines that had been overturned by Lin Biao and the Gang of Four (the term "rectifying the wrongs and reversing the misjudgments" was not yet used at that time). While he was busy preparing for the reopening of the Central Party School, he also considered publishing a journal to write articles and commentaries to enlighten and elevate people's ideological understanding. After a period of preparation, on June 4, 1977, he convened a meeting with a few of us to discuss in detail the establishment of "Theoretical Trends." Later, he formed a small "Theoretical Trends Group" to publish the journal under his direct guidance.

    Comrade Hu Yaobang determined that "Theoretical Trends" would be an internal journal of ideological and theoretical nature aimed at Party leaders. He decided, based on the characteristics of Party leaders, to publish one article per issue to propose and elucidate a problem. Considering the many theoretical issues that needed to be addressed and elucidated at that time, he decided to publish an issue every five days.

    "Theoretical Trends" was launched on July 15, 1977. The first issue was printed in only 300 copies, distributed mainly to a few comrades within the Central Party School and to leaders at the central and local levels, with the distribution list determined by Comrade Hu Yaobang. In response to requests from leaders across various regions, the print run of "Theoretical Trends" gradually increased, quickly reaching several thousand copies.

    Comrade Hu Yaobang fully realized the importance and difficulty of publishing this journal. He repeatedly told the members of the "Theoretical Trends Group" that they should elevate their work to the level of changing the course of history, clearly recognize their historical responsibility, and the historical mission of theoretical work. He encouraged everyone to be vanguards and heroes on the ideological front.

    To ensure the success of "Theoretical Trends," Comrade Hu Yaobang devoted a great deal of effort. He identified topics and ideas, organizing everyone to write articles. At that time, the articles published in "Theoretical Trends" were all reviewed and finalized by Comrade Hu Yaobang.

    At the end of 1977, the staff of the "People's Daily" requested to publish the articles from "Theoretical Trends" publicly and asked how to sign the name. Comrade Hu Yaobang said, "They publish editorials and commentaries. Some issues can be discussed by everyone! We can also participate in the discussion! We can be special commentators!" This is how the special commentator articles that had a significant impact in the following years came about.

    Through the journal "Theoretical Trends," Comrade Hu Yaobang organized and promoted the discussion on the criterion of truth.

    Around November 12, 1977, Comrade Hu Yaobang proposed the viewpoint that practice should be the criterion for testing truth and distinguishing the correctness of lines. This was actually the guiding principle for his organization of the Party School's teaching and also the principle for publishing "Theoretical Trends."

    Based on the above-mentioned ideological views elucidated by Comrade Hu Yaobang, the "Theoretical Trends Group" organized the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth." This article, which was a collective effort, was reviewed and finalized by Comrade Hu Yaobang and published in the 60th issue of "Theoretical Trends" on May 10, 1978. It was subsequently published as a "special commentator" article in the "Guangming Daily." The Xinhua News Agency broadcasted the article on the same day. The "People's Daily" and the "Liberation Army Daily" reprinted the full text the next day, and other newspapers followed suit, sparking a strong response and initiating a widespread discussion on the criterion of truth.

    During the discussion on the criterion of truth, Comrade Hu Yaobang, with the courage of a proletarian revolutionary, faced immense pressure to organize the writing of several important articles. In response to criticisms of the article "Practice is the Sole Criterion for Testing Truth," Comrade Hu Yaobang convened a meeting with the "Theoretical Trends Group" to conduct research. At that time, the political situation was quite complex. As Comrade Hu Yaobang put it, the situation at that time was indeed not very clear. With the firm support of Comrade Luo Ruiqing, the Secretary-General of the Central Military Commission at that time, the article titled "A Most Basic Principle of Marxism" was published as a special commentator article in the "Liberation Army Daily" on June 24, 1978 ("People's Daily" published it simultaneously). Comrade Hu Yaobang said that during the process of slightly revising and publishing this article, Comrade Luo Ruiqing called him at least six times to discuss it. The publication of this article greatly promoted the discussion on the criterion of truth.

    To deepen the discussion on the criterion of truth and better connect it with reality, Comrade Hu Yaobang guided the "Theoretical Trends Group" to write the article "All Subjective Ideological Elements Must Undergo the Test of Practice." Additionally, Comrade Hu Yaobang organized the writing of articles such as "Opening Up a Broad Horizon for Theoretical Work." These articles, after being published in "Theoretical Trends," were mostly published in the "People's Daily" as "special commentator" articles.

    Comrade Hu Yaobang was the organizer and promoter of the historically significant discussion on the criterion of truth, which played a major role in promoting ideological liberation and rectifying the wrongs. This is an indelible major contribution he made to the Party and the people. The Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee highly evaluated this discussion.

    Comrade Hu Yaobang's personal involvement in publishing "Theoretical Trends" shows how much he valued ideological and theoretical work, how much he valued the Party's ideological construction, and how much he valued the ideological education of Party leaders. Moreover, he did it with remarkable success. These are very enlightening to us.

　　耀邦同志与《理论动态》
    沈宝祥
    记得在１９７８年下半年，真理标准讨论已经初步开展起来的时候，耀邦同志在同“理论动态组”同志的一次谈话中，曾经深情地说，我死后，要写上一笔，生前办过《理论动态》。耀邦同志一生为党为人民作出了多方面的重要贡献。他在主持中央党校工作时亲自创办《理论动态》这个内部刊物，是他的重要贡献之一。
    耀邦同志是在粉碎“四人帮”以后的１９７７年３月到中央党校主持工作的。当时，在“两个凡是”方针的束缚下，人们的思想还处在僵化状态之中。耀邦同志深深感到，把被林彪、四人帮颠倒了的思想是非、理论是非、路线是非再颠倒过来（当时还没用“拨乱反正”这个词），是十分迫切而重要的任务。在紧张地筹备中央党校复校的过程中，他同时考虑要办一个刊物，写文章，发评论，去启发和提高人们的思想认识。经过一段时间酝酿，在１９７７年６月４日，他召集我们几个人开会，具体研究创办《理论动态》。以后，他组建了一个人数很少的“理论动态组”，在他直接指导下办刊。
    耀邦同志确定，《理论动态》是一个面向党的领导干部的思想理论性质的内部刊物。他从领导干部的特点出发，决定每期刊登一篇文章，提出和阐明一个问题。考虑到当时需要从理论上回答和阐明的问题很多，他决定５天出一期。
    《理论动态》在１９７７年７月１５日创刊，第一期只印了三百份，除发给中央党校内部部分同志外，主要发送中央和地方的领导同志，名单都是由耀邦同志定的。应各地领导干部的要求，《理论动态》的印数不断增加，很快就增加到几千份。
    耀邦同志充分意识到办这个刊物的重要意义和艰巨性。他不止一次地对理论动态组同志讲，要把自己的工作提高到扭转乾坤的高度来认识，要明确认识自己的历史责任和理论工作的历史使命。他鼓励大家，要做一个思想战线上的前卫战士和思想勇士。
    为了办好《理论动态》，耀邦同志倾注了大量的心血。他针对林彪、四人帮制造的谬论和我们党长期存在的“左”的观点，出题目，出思想，组织大家写文章。当时，《理论动态》刊登的文章，都是由耀邦同志审阅定稿的。
    １９７７年底，《人民日报》的同志要求公开刊登《理论动态》的文章，问该怎么署名。耀邦同志说，他们发社论，写评论，有些问题，大家都可以议论嘛！我们也可以参加议论嘛！我们可以当特约评论员嘛！这就是前些年发生很大影响的特约评论员文章的由来。
    耀邦同志通过《理论动态》这个刊物，组织和推动了关于真理标准的讨论。
    大约在１９７７年１１月１２日，耀邦同志就提出这样的观点：应当以实践为检验真理、辨别路线是非的标准。这实际上是他组织党校教学的方针，也是他办《理论动态》的方针。
    根据耀邦同志阐明的上述这些思想观点，理论动态组组织了《实践是检验真理的唯一标准》这篇文章。这篇实际上是体现集体劳动成果的文章，由耀邦同志审阅定稿，在１９７８年５月１０日出刊的《理论动态》第６０期刊出。随后，作为“特约评论员”文章在《光明日报》公开发表。新华社当天转发了这篇文章。《人民日报》和《解放军报》于第二天就全文转载，其他各报相继转载，引起了强烈的反响，由此引发了一场关于真理标准的大讨论。
    在真理标准讨论的过程中，耀邦同志以无产阶级革命家的气魄，顶着很大的压力，组织撰写了多篇重要文章。针对一些人对《实践是检验真理的唯一标准》一文的责难，耀邦同志召集理论动态组同志进行了研究。当时《人民日报》的负责人一起参加了研究，决定由理论动态组再写一篇文章。当时的政治形势比较复杂，用耀邦同志的话说，那个时候的局面也确实是不太明朗。在当时的中央军委秘书长罗瑞卿同志的坚决支持下，这篇以《马克思主义的一个最基本的原则》为题的文章，以特约评论员名义在１９７８年６月２４日的《解放军报》发表（《人民日报》同时刊载）。耀邦同志说，在略改编发这篇文章过程中，罗瑞卿同志至少６次打电话同他商量。这篇文章的发表，对真理标准的讨论是有力的推动。
    为了把真理标准的讨论引向深入，更好地联系实际，耀邦同志又指导理论动态组同志撰写了《一切主观世界的东西都要经受实践检验》的文章。此外，耀邦同志还组织撰写了《打开理论工作的广阔天地》等文章。这些文章在《理论动态》刊登后，大都以“特约评论员”名义在《人民日报》公开发表。
    耀邦同志是具有历史意义的真理标准讨论的组织者和推动者，对思想解放和拨乱反正起了重大的推动作用。这是他为党为人民作出的一个不可磨灭的重大贡献。党的十一届三中全会对这个讨论作出了高度的评价。
    耀邦同志亲自办《理论动态》这件事向我们说明，他是多么重视思想和理论工作，多么重视党的思想建设，多么重视对党的领导干部的思想教育工作，而且，做得卓有成效。这些，对我们都是很有启发的。
