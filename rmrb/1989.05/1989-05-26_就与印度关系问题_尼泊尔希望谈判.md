Nepal has proposed that talks at the foreign minister level be held with India in the first week of June to discuss bilateral relations.

Nepal government's chief spokesman Bista said today that the government has taken this step because it is deeply concerned about the hardships the people have been facing since the India-Nepal trade and transit treaties expired on March 23.

Bista said that the Nepal government hopes the Indian government will accept this proposal.
