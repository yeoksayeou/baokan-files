Title: An Old Remedy

A social malady is spreading rampantly. The medical community cannot definitively name this ailment, so I will temporarily call it the "curse-and-do" syndrome!

People generally detest the widespread phenomenon of squandering and corrupt practices such as embezzlement and bribery, and they curse these behaviors endlessly. However, there are still quite a few people who, while grumbling in indignation, are secretly indulging in these very same practices.

In meetings, everyone will unanimously criticize the use of public funds for extravagant banquets, offering sharp critiques and biting sarcasm. Yet, once they enter the dining hall and sit down at the lavish feast, they all start eating and drinking voraciously.

When it comes to pulling strings and finding backdoors, everyone is outraged. However, when it comes to personal promotions, job placements for children, or the interests of small groups within the organization, they all start racking their brains to figure out the "network of connections" and discuss the "science of backdoors."

This syndrome is so widespread and severe that some people, watching this disease, feel like they are in a small boat without oars or a rudder, rapidly drifting towards treacherous rapids, feeling anxious and helpless.

Actually, there is a solution. A very effective remedy is "start with myself"!

Oh, this remedy is as old as the hills! True, it is indeed an old remedy. However, I still want to say that this remedy was previously ineffective not because the remedy itself was wrong, but because the method of administration was wrong. If taken scientifically, it will definitely work. There are three methods, worth a try.

First, it must be taken regularly and in the correct dosage. It cannot be taken intermittently, and it cannot be said to be taken but actually not taken.

Second, leaders who suffer from this syndrome must take double the dosage. The higher the position, the more they must take. Otherwise, if only the masses take it and the leaders do not, this social disease is likely to relapse. The more relapses, the harder it is to cure.

Third, leaders who have this disease must take the remedy simultaneously with the masses who have this disease. Otherwise, it will be like pests in farmland: pests that have not been treated will fly or crawl to the fields that have been treated and continue to cause harm, making the treatment ineffective.

Someone might ask, why do you always direct your criticism at a few people who are in leadership positions? It is not that I want to, but I have to. According to observations from a high-magnification social science observation device, although the number of leaders who have this syndrome is small, they are an important factor in the formation of this social disease. Therefore, if leaders are not reminded to prevent and treat this syndrome, it will not be possible to eradicate this social disease!

### 一个老掉牙的药方

　　一个老掉牙的药方
    官伟勋
    一种社会病正在蔓延肆虐。这病的名称，医学界无法确定，我暂时就叫它“边骂边干症”吧！
    人们几乎都对相当普遍存在的败家子作风以及贪污受贿之类的腐败行为深恶痛绝，骂不绝口；然而却又有相当多的人，一面在愤愤不平地骂着，一面又津津有味地干着。
    在会上，谈起用公款大吃大喝，大家都会异口同声地给予尖锐的批评，辛辣的讽刺；然而，一走进餐厅坐在奢糜的宴席前，却又一个个甩开腮帮子豪饮鲸吞起来。
    提起拉关系走后门，人人义愤填膺。然而，一遇到事关个人升职晋级、子女工作安排，以及本单位小团体利益时，却又一个个挖空心思地钻研起“关系网”、探讨起“后门学”来。
    这种病症涉及面是如此之广，如此之烈，以至一些人看着这种病，就像坐在一只失去桨舵而又急速向激流险滩漂去的小船一样，干着急，没有办法。
    其实办法还是有的。一个十分对症的药方，是“从我做起”！
    呵，你这方子早就老掉牙了！不错，这确实是个老掉了牙的药方。然而我还是要说，此方以前所以没有什么疗效，不是方子不对，而是服用方法不对。如果照科学的方法服用，保管管用。方法有三，不妨一试。
    一、必须定时定量服用。不能“三天打鱼，两天晒网”，更不能说服而实际上不服。
    二、犯有此症的领导干部，要加倍服用。地位越高越要加倍服用。否则，只让群众服用，领导不服用，此一社会病极易反复。反复次数越多越难治。
    三、犯此病的领导一定要与犯有此症的群众同时服用。否则，就会像农田的病虫害一样，未治过病虫的田中的病虫，就会飞到或爬到已治过病虫的田中继续为害，已治过的等于没治。
    有人可能会问，你为什么老是把矛头对着少数做领导工作的人呢？非所好也，不得已也。根据高倍数社会科学观察仪测试的显示看，犯有此症的领导虽然人数不多，却是形成这种社会病灶的重要因素。因此，不提醒领导注意防治此症，则不足以祛除此社会病也！
