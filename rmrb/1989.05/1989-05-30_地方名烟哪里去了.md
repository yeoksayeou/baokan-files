	Where Have the Local Brand Cigarettes Gone?

	In July 1988, the state deregulated the prices of 13 famous brand cigarettes, allowing these high-quality cigarettes to reach a broader consumer base. However, some provincial-level famous brand cigarettes have disappeared from the market. Where have these cigarettes gone?

	During January and February of this year, the Uhai Tobacco Branch Company had a stockpile of 108,000 cartons of local brand cigarettes. During the Spring Festival, nearly 100,000 cartons were sold with the approval of relevant leaders. The destinations of these local brand cigarettes are as follows: first, they were allocated to connections; second, they were sold to large buyers and resold at high prices in the black market; third, they were allocated to other provinces. All three of these situations violate the State Council's tobacco monopoly regulations.

	Currently, local brand cigarettes are quite popular. For example, the Daqingshan cigarettes produced by the Hohhot Tobacco Factory are beloved by the residents of Uhai City. Since the establishment of the Uhai Tobacco Branch Company in 1984, regular-priced Daqingshan cigarettes have never been seen in state-owned stores. However, they have always been available in the black market. During this Spring Festival, the Uhai Tobacco Company had over 10,000 cartons of Daqingshan cigarettes, 90% of which were sold with approval slips. It is estimated that a significant portion of these cigarettes ended up in the black market.

	Generally popular cigarettes, such as the special filter-tipped Ganghua cigarettes produced by the Hohhot Tobacco Factory, have also become targets for approval slips. Since January, the 37,000 cartons of Ganghua cigarettes allocated to the Uhai Tobacco Branch Company were all sold with approval slips. For several months, over 100 state-owned and collective stores in the city have been out of Ganghua cigarettes, but individual vendors' stalls have never run out. Some resourceful individual vendors obtained Ganghua cigarettes from the Uhai Tobacco Branch Company at retail prices and resold them at 12 yuan per carton to less resourceful individual vendors, who then sold them at a high price of 13 yuan per carton, marking up the price by 2.3 yuan per carton compared to the state-set price. If the production and sales of local brand cigarettes are not simultaneously rectified, the cigarette market will remain chaotic.

### 地方名烟哪里去了

    地方名烟哪里去了
    1988年7月，国家放开13种名烟价格，使名优烟与广大消费者见面了。但是，一些省级地方名优烟却在市场上消失了，这些烟到哪里去了呢？
    今年一、二月间，乌海烟草分公司库存地方名烟10.8万多条，春节期间，经有关领导人批条出售了近10万条。这些地方名烟的去向，一是批给关系户；二是卖大户，流向黑市高价出售；三是批给外地。这三种情况均违反国务院的烟草专卖条例。
    现在，地方名烟颇受人们的欢迎。例如，呼和浩特市烟厂产的大青山香烟，为我市市民喜爱。1984年乌海烟草分公司组建至今，平价大青山烟就从没有在国营商店与市民见过面。但黑市上却一直有售。今年春节期间，乌海烟草公司有大青山烟1万多条，其中90％是按批条出售的，估计有相当一部分流入黑市。
    一般畅销的卷烟，如呼和浩特市烟厂产的特制过滤嘴钢花烟也成为批条子的对象。1月以来，乌海烟草分公司按计划调入的3.7万条钢花烟，也都批条子出售。全市100多家国营、集体商店钢花烟脱销好几个月，但个体户的货摊上却从未间断。一些有“能耐”的个体户，从乌海烟草分公司以零售价批得钢花烟，转手以每条12元的价格推销给没有“能耐”的个体户，他们又以每条13元的高价出售，每条烟高出国家牌价2.3元。地方名烟如果不从产、销两方面同时进行整顿，卷烟市场仍然是混乱局面。
