Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, who was found to have used banned substances during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, was attacked by a group of young men in Toronto early on the morning of the 11th. Johnson lost a tooth and his lip was swollen, and he was immediately sent to the hospital.

Johnson's lawyer, Furtman, said that recently, Johnson has had to be on guard against such savage behavior every time he goes out. His daily life has been threatened, and this matter should attract public attention. After a day of treatment and rest, Johnson is currently feeling better.
