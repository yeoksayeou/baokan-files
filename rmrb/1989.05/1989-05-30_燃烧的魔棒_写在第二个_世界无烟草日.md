The latest figures show that in 1988, China's cigarette production exceeded 300 million cartons (50,000 cigarettes per carton). Since 1978, China's cigarette production has increased by 20 million cartons each year. This information was disclosed by Ma Wenming, an official in charge of production at the China National Tobacco Corporation, on May 24.

At the same time, in an old building along the Houhai in Beijing, Tian Fengchun, an official in charge of the tobacco and health project at the National Hygiene and Health Commission, said: Currently, the number of smokers in China has reached nearly 300 million, and the number of smokers is increasing every year. According to medical experts, in the not-too-distant future, the number of people in China who die from diseases related to smoking will exceed one million.

The quantity of tobacco and the incidence of disease are both increasing. Faced with the harm that cigarettes cause to the human body, this disaster, more cruel than war, plague, and famine, many enlightened individuals have issued a mournful call: Ban tobacco!

However, the warnings of the first global no-smoking day a year ago did not awaken the smokers who are immersed in the smoke. The wispy smoke still rises. This "magic wand" that stirs the heart, the cigarette, continues to wield its tyranny over humanity. Why does the phenomenon of smoking persist despite repeated bans? What is the source of its magic?

The various mentalities of addicts

The harm of smoking to health is a well-established fact and does not need further elaboration. However, the mentalities of addicts vary.

Social type. Many smokers believe that smoking is a necessity for social interaction and a bond that connects people. When going out to do business or visiting relatives and friends, one must rely on cigarettes to pave the way, so they are unwilling to give up smoking.

Show-off type. Smoking demonstrates a certain demeanor and temperament, especially smoking foreign cigarettes can show off one's status and achieve self-satisfaction.

Blind-following type. This is mainly among middle and high school students and young women, and smoking has a certain degree of blindness, which is related to the influence of Western culture.

Entertainment type. Smoking is seen as a form of entertainment, seeking sensory stimulation to achieve psychological and physiological satisfaction.

Aids thinking. Those engaged in mental labor often use this as an excuse, believing that smoking can inspire creativity.

Relieves fatigue. According to the 1986 national smoking sample survey analysis, 30.5% of people believe that smoking can relieve physical fatigue.

The above mentalities have led to an increase in the number of smokers in China.

Confusion from policy

The prevalence of smoking in China is not only due to the demand from smokers but also due to the constraints of the national economy and finance. While the state advocates quitting smoking, it still shows a certain attachment to the tobacco industry.

Last year, China's tobacco tax revenue reached 21 billion yuan, an increase of 4 billion yuan compared to 1978, accounting for 1/10 of the national fiscal revenue. If this revenue were lost, the national finances would face an unimaginable predicament.

From the perspective of the health department, these figures are unacceptable. According to statistics, the treatment costs for diseases caused by smoking, as well as the economic losses caused by fires and accidents due to smoking, also amount to hundreds of billions of yuan. Especially the harm to the human body, which is difficult to calculate in economic terms.

Faced with this situation, what policy choices should be made?

Opinions from various quarters

Sixth and Seventh National People's Congress representatives, Professor Zhu Siming from Nanjing Medical College, has submitted seven proposals, strongly advocating the dangers of smoking. In his essay "Seven Arguments for Strictly Prohibiting Smoking in Public Places," he wrote: Smoking seriously harms people's health, and the practice of giving and receiving cigarettes has become a tool for social corruption and must be strictly controlled. The production of tobacco. Thirteen members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference also submitted six proposals with the same content, unfortunately, they did not receive sufficient attention.

Famous psychologist Professor Gao Hansheng said: Humanity has chosen to smoke, regardless of the reasons that led to it, it should be said that cigarettes still have an attraction for humanity. Cigarettes are like a stimulant, once they form an unconscious habit, they become a physiological need for smokers, from which they obtain pleasure and joy. Non-smokers cannot experience or feel this. From a psychological perspective, if one does not hate cigarettes emotionally, one may develop the habit of smoking, ultimately trampling on one's physiological and psychological elements.

Vice President of the Jiangsu Provincial Sociological Association, Song Linfei, said: Smoking reflects the level of social civilization. It can be said with certainty that smoking is a bad lifestyle. It has become a "modern social disease." Some people equate it with sexually transmitted diseases and alcoholism. It brings double harm to people, one to the body and the other to the mind. To control tobacco harm, comprehensive control and dual-track management are necessary.

Where is the way out?

Tobacco and health, opinions vary, where is the way out?

1. Actively carry out propaganda and education on the harm of smoking to health, especially in old, young, border, and underdeveloped regions and culturally underdeveloped regions, carry out sustained propaganda using various forms such as slides, films, and pictures to educate primary and secondary school students, starting from a young age, and improving the whole society's awareness of the harm of tobacco.

2. Quickly carry out legislative work to bring smoking cessation into a legal track.

3. Under the current situation, tap potential and produce safe cigarettes, reduce tar content to below the 15 milligrams international standard, and reduce the degree of harm.

4. Develop new products and produce more mixed-type and filtered cigarettes.

5. Change the social habit of using cigarettes to entertain guests.

6. Rectify unqualified cigarette factories and prevent low-quality, highly harmful products from entering the market.

    燃烧的魔棒
    ——写在第二个“世界无烟草日”
    张彦林  陈杰
      最新公布的数字
    1988年，我国卷烟产量突破3000万箱大关！（5万支香烟为一箱）
    1978年以来，我国的卷烟产量每年都以200万箱的速度递增。
    这是中国烟草总公司主管生产的官员马文明在5月24日透露的信息。
    同一时间，在北京后海沿一座古老的建筑里，全国爱卫会主管烟草与健康项目的官员田丰淳说：
    目前，我国吸烟人数已经达到近三亿人，吸烟的人数每年都呈递增的趋势。
    据医学专家预测，不远的将来，我国每年死于与吸烟有关的疾病者，将超过百万。
    烟草的数量和发病率同时在增长。
    面对香烟对人体的危害，这场比战争、瘟疫、饥荒更残酷的灾难，不少有识之士发出了苍凉的疾呼：禁烟！
    然而，一年前全球第一个戒烟日的劝告，并没有唤醒沉溺于烟云中的烟民，袅袅烟雾依然升腾。香烟这支荡人心神的“魔棒”，仍在向人类施放着淫威，为什么吸烟现象屡禁不止？它的魔力何在？
    瘾君子的种种心态
    吸烟有害健康，已成公理，无需赘言，然而瘾君子的心态又各不相同。
    交际型。不少吸烟者认为，吸烟是人际交往的需要，是联络人与人之间感情的纽带。出门办事，探亲访友，要靠香烟铺路，因此，不愿放弃吸烟。
    炫耀型。吸烟表明一种风度、气质，尤其抽外烟能显出自己的身价，实现自我满足。
    盲从型。以中、小学生和女青年为主，吸烟带有一定的盲目性，这与西方文化的传入有一定关系。
    消遣型。把吸烟作为一种娱乐，寻求感官的刺激，达到心理和生理满足。
    有助思考。从事脑力劳动的人，多以此为借口，他们认为吸烟可使人产生灵感。
    解除疲劳。据1986年全国吸烟抽样调查分析表明，有30.5％的人认为吸烟可以解除人体的疲劳。
    上述种种心态，导致我国吸烟人数不断增加。
      来自政策的困惑
    吸烟现象在我国的泛滥，不仅来自烟民的需求，还来自国家政府受到经济财政的制约，国家虽在主张戒烟，但却表现出对烟草工业的留恋。
    去年，我国烟草税利收入高达210亿，比1978年增加了40个亿。占全国财政收入的1／10。倘若失去了这个收入，国家的财政就会出现难以想象的困境。
    在卫生部门看来，这种数字无法让人容忍，据统计，因吸烟而导致的疾病治疗费用以及因吸烟而引起火灾、误事等所造成的经济损失也高达上百亿元。尤其是对人体的危害，是难以用经济账来计算的。
    面对这种状况，政策应作何选择呢？
      各界人士如是说
    六届、七届人大代表、南京医学院教授朱思明已经七次上书，力陈吸烟的危害，他在《七论严禁在公共场所吸烟》中写道：吸烟严重地危害了人们的身体健康，送烟、敬烟已成为社会腐败现象的媒介工具，必须严格控制烟草的生产。全国政协13位委员也提出过同一内容的六份议案，可惜都没有引起足够重视。
    著名心理学教授高汉生说：人类选择了吸烟，不管是什么原因促成的，应该说，香烟对人类还是有吸引力。香烟犹如一剂兴奋药，一旦形成一种无意识的习惯便成为烟民的一种生理需要，从中得到快感和愉悦。不吸烟者是无法体会和感受的。从心理学的角度讲，倘若不从情感上憎恨香烟，就有可能染上吸烟的习惯，最终也会践踏人的生理和心理要素。
    江苏省社会学会副会长宋林飞说：吸烟反映了社会文明的程度，可以肯定地说，吸烟是个不好的生活方式。它已成为一种“现代社会病”。有人把它同性病、酗酒等同起来，它给人带来双重危害，一是身体，二是心灵。要治理烟害，必须综合治理，双管齐下。
        出路在哪里？
    烟草与健康，众说纷纭，它的出路在哪里？
    一、积极进行吸烟有害健康的宣传教育，尤其是在老、少、边、穷地区和文化不发达地区进行持久的宣传，利用各种形式，如幻灯、电影、图片等对中、小学生进行教育，从小抓起，提高全社会对烟草危害的认识。
    二、尽快进行立法工作，使戒烟纳入法律化的轨道。
    三、在现有状况下，挖掘潜力，生产安全型香烟，降低焦油含量。使之达到15毫克国际标准以下，减少危害程度。
    四、开发新产品，多生产混合型和过滤嘴香烟。
    五、改变以烟待客的社会习惯。
    六、整顿不合格的烟厂，杜绝低质量、危害大的产品进入市场。
