Title: Anticipating a National Awakening in Education

At a parents' meeting for elementary school students, a parent shared his views on school education:

Schools should first teach children how to be qualified citizens, teaching them specific items one by one. For example, not to steal, not to cheat, not to rob, not to spit on the ground, to cross the street using the pedestrian crosswalk, to give up seats on the bus to the elderly, the sick, the weak, and the disabled, to work honestly without cutting corners, to sell genuine goods and not fake alcohol or medicine, to be an official without corruption and decadence... As for knowledge like the multiplication table and addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, most children will learn it when they need it, whether they learn it a day earlier or later doesn't matter much.

His words and thoughts obviously contain deep concerns about the current social atmosphere. Forty years after the founding of the nation, we still haven't taught citizens not to spit on the ground, to queue up when taking public transportation, and for men to take care of women and children. As a result, in some people, there is a sense that whoever dares to break the rules is the one with the ability. In Beijing, the author witnessed a strong young man pushing aside a little girl with a schoolbag to board the bus first, without caring whether the poor girl might fall under the wheels. This is indeed a shame. Since society cannot set a good example in everything, we can only hope for education. What other options are there?

However, education is a slow process, and results take 20 years. Elementary school, middle school, and university together take about a dozen years. Schools teach what they should, and after students enter society for a few years, they basically do what they were taught in school and are not assimilated by bad habits. Only then can we say it has been effective. It's like planting a tree; you have to wait until the tree takes root and provides shade before you can say it's successful.

According to this calculation, 40 years after the founding of the nation is exactly two cycles, enough time to cultivate two generations. In reality, however, at least half of this time has been wasted to varying degrees. The reason is that everyone, from top to bottom, is impatient. They are dissatisfied with the school's daily and yearly hard work in cultivating students, so they rely on political movements, leadership calls, media propaganda, and forced indoctrination, hoping that young people will grow up faster. These methods cannot be said to have no effect, but they are mostly things that cool down and heat up in turns. Moreover, there are more times when emotions are involved and fewer times when things are done scientifically. The result is that what was originally thought to be rain after a cloud had passed was actually a distortion of the laws of education. The enormous driving force that education should have on the growth of children, on the development of society, politics, economy, science, and culture, has never been fully realized. For the sake of immediate gratification, misguiding the youth, misguiding the party and the country, what is gained? What is lost?

Recently, someone has raised the slogan of "education saving the nation." It may not be very appropriate to shout this slogan now, but it is comforting that it seems to have conveyed the message of a national awakening in education. If so, then my children are fortunate, all children are fortunate, and the country and society are fortunate.

　　期待全民教育觉醒
    林陶
    在一次小学生家长会上，听到一位家长谈对学校教育的意见：
    学校首先要教给孩子们怎样做一个合格的公民，要一项一项具体地教。如不偷、不骗、不抢、不随地吐痰，过马路走人行横道，上车为老弱病残让座，长大了做工不偷工减料，做买卖不售假酒假药，做官不贪污腐化……至于“人口刀手”、加减乘除这些知识，一般孩子到需要时都学得会，早一天会晚一天会关系不大。
    他的所言所思，显然包含着对现在社会风气的深深忧虑。建国４０年了，尚没有教会国民不随地吐痰、乘公共汽车要排队、男士要照顾妇女儿童，以致在某些人中形成一种谁敢不按规矩办事谁能耐的风气。在北京乘车，笔者目睹一位壮小伙子一把推开前边背书包的小学生抢先上车，而不管这位可怜的小女孩是否倒在了车轮下。这不能不说是一种耻辱。现在既然社会还不能事事给孩子们作出好的榜样，大家只能寄希望于教育，此外还有什么办法呢？
    然而教育是慢功，见效要等２０年。小学、中学、大学共十几年，学校该教的都教了，学生走上社会若干年，基本上照学校教的做了，没有被不良风气所同化，这才算有了效果。好比种树，总要等到这树种活了，有了绿荫，才算成功。
    照此计算，建国４０年时间，恰好两个周期，可以培养出两代人。实际却不然。其间最少有一半的时间被不同程度地耽误了。究其原因，就是上上下下都有人性急，嫌学校那样朝朝暮暮、年年月月辛勤培养不过瘾，于是靠政治运动、靠领导号召、靠舆论鼓吹、靠硬性灌输，希望青少年成长得更快一点，这些不能说都没有效果，然而毕竟是些冷一阵、热一阵的事，更何况感情用事的时候多，科学办事的时候少，结果是：原以为折过一片云就有雨，实际上使教育规律被扭曲，教育对孩子们成长、对社会政治、经济、科技、文化发展本应起到的巨大推动作用，始终没有发挥出来。为逞一时之快，而误人子弟、误党误国，得焉？失焉？
    时下有人重提“教育救国”的口号。现在喊这口号不一定很恰当，但令人欣慰的是，其间似乎已透露出全民教育觉醒的信息，若果如此，则我家孩子幸甚，天下孩子幸甚，国家社会幸甚。
