More than 200 labor models from China and North Korea gathered in the Chinese border city of Dandong yesterday to celebrate International Labor Day together.

May in Dandong is clear and bright, with flowers blooming everywhere. The Yalu River, symbolizing Sino-North Korean friendship, flows blue and green. At 9 AM, the friendship delegation from Sinuiju City, North Korea, crossed the Yalu River. Immediately, drums beat and applause echoed, as the labor models from both countries greeted each other warmly, exchanged thoughts, and presented each other with banners and souvenirs. They then engaged in various friendly activities, singing songs like "Ode to the Heroes" in both Chinese and Korean, and participating in various games. In the afternoon, the labor models from both countries visited the Jinhuashan Park, toured the city of Dandong, and took commemorative photos together.

　　中朝两国劳模在丹东联欢
    新华社沈阳５月２日电  （记者陈光明）中朝两国２００多名劳动模范昨天欢聚在我国边境城市丹东，共同欢度“五·一”国际劳动节。
    ５月的丹东，天清气朗，鲜花竞开，象征中朝友谊的鸭绿江水绿如蓝。上午９时，朝鲜新义州市友好联欢团跨过鸭绿江，顿时，锣鼓喧天，掌声四起，两国劳动模范一见如故，手拉着手互致问候，交流思想，并互赠锦旗和纪念品。接着开展了联谊活动，两国劳动模范用中朝两国语言演唱《英雄赞》等歌曲，进行了多种游艺活动。下午，两国劳模又共同游览了锦江山公园，观看了丹东市容，并合影留念。
