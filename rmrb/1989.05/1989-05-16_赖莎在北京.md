	"I am very honored to have the opportunity to visit the renowned art museum dedicated to the famous artist Xu Beihong. His works fully demonstrate that art is a major means for people of different countries to understand and communicate with each other."

	This is what Raisa Gorbacheva wrote after visiting the Xu Beihong Memorial Hall.

	This morning, when Raisa Gorbacheva and the visiting Soviet cultural figures toured the Xu Beihong Memorial Hall, they were warmly received by Xu Beihong's wife, Liao Jingwen, and her son, Xu Qingping, a vice-professor at the Central Academy of Fine Arts.

	Liao Jingwen told the Soviet guests that Xu Beihong held an exhibition in the Soviet Union in 1934 and had deep feelings for the Soviet people.

	The memorial hall was built in 1983. Raisa Gorbacheva and other Soviet guests carefully appreciated over 200 works by the artist from various periods, including traditional Chinese paintings, oil paintings, sketches, and his biography.

	Xu Beihong was skilled at painting horses. From his youth, he dedicated himself to sketching horses and studying their anatomy. Raisa praised the meticulously shaped and vigorously brushed works "Galloping Horse" and "Herd of Horses" on display here. She said: "Only one painter in Europe can compare with his horse paintings."

	On the second floor of the exhibition hall, there are two bronze-green busts of Lenin and Tolstoy. Mrs. Xu introduced that these were personally made and sent to Xu Beihong by the Soviet sculptor Merkulov.

	After the tour, Liao Jingwen presented Raisa with Xu Beihong's masterpieces "Galloping Horse" and "Spring Rain in Li River," a set of Xu Beihong's art books, and her own book "Xu Beihong's Life" in both Chinese and English.

	Raisa presented the memorial hall with a book of the Soviet State Gallery and a book by a Soviet scholar on Xu Beihong's artistic creations.

	This morning, Raisa Gorbacheva also visited the National Library of China in Beijing.

	Accompanied by Zhu Lin, wife of Premier Li Peng, and the library director Ren Jiyu, Raisa was interested in visiting the exhibition on the origin of Chinese characters, the rare book reading room, and the foreign language new book reading room. She inquired in detail about the history of Chinese characters and book management.

	Ren Jiyu, on behalf of the library, presented Raisa with a copy of the "Yongle Encyclopedia" and a commemorative album for the 75th anniversary of the library's opening. Raisa also presented a 11th-century ancient Russian manuscript and an album.

	After nearly an hour of visiting, Raisa wrote in the guestbook: "Visiting the National Library allowed me to learn about the precious and great spiritual heritage of the Chinese people, which is a part of world culture. This reminds me of a saying by the great Russian writer Gorky: 'Books are the 'treasure among treasures' created by humanity on the path to happiness.'"

	This afternoon, Raisa also enthusiastically visited the Temple of Heaven Park.

　　赖莎在北京
    新华社记者  辛怀时
    “我很荣幸有机会参观世界知名的艺术家徐悲鸿纪念馆。他的创作充分说明，艺术是各国人民相互了解和交往的主要方式。”
    这是赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃在参观徐悲鸿纪念馆后写下的印象。
    今天上午，当赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃和随同来访的苏联文化界知名人士参观徐悲鸿纪念馆时，受到了徐悲鸿夫人廖静文和她的儿子、中央美院副教授徐庆平的热情接待。
    廖静文女士告诉苏联客人，徐悲鸿１９３４年曾到苏联举办画展，他对苏联人民怀有深厚的感情。
    这座纪念馆建于１９８３年。赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃和其他苏联客人仔细地欣赏了艺术家在各个时期创作的２００多幅作品，其中包括国画、油画、素描和他的生平介绍。
    徐悲鸿善于画马。从青年时代起就致力于马的写生，精研马的解剖。赖莎对这里陈列的造型严谨、笔墨奔放的作品《奔马》、《群马》表示赞赏。她说：欧洲只有一个画家能与他画的马媲美。
    在二楼展厅里陈列着两个铜绿色的列宁和托尔斯泰的面模。徐夫人介绍说，这是苏联雕塑家梅尔库洛夫亲自制作并送给徐悲鸿的。
    参观后，廖静文向赖莎赠送了徐悲鸿的杰作《奔马》、《漓江春雨》，一套徐悲鸿画册和她的著作《徐悲鸿一生》中英文版各一本。
    赖莎向纪念馆赠送了一本苏联国立画廊的画册和一位苏联学者研究徐悲鸿艺术创作的书。
    今天上午，赖莎·戈尔巴乔娃访问了中国的国家总书库——北京图书馆。
    在李鹏总理夫人朱琳和图书馆馆长任继愈的陪同下，赖莎饶有兴趣地参观了中国文字起源展览、善本阅览室、外文新书阅览室。她详细询问了中国的文字历史、图书管理等情况。
    任继愈代表图书馆向赖莎赠送了一本《永乐大典》和一本《北图开馆７５周年纪念画册》。赖莎也回赠了一本１１世纪古俄罗斯手稿善本和一本画册。
    近１小时的参观结束后，赖莎在留言簿上写道：“访问北图使我有机会了解到中华民族珍贵而伟大的精神遗产，这种遗产是世界文化的一部分。这使我想起了我国伟大作家高尔基的一句话：书籍是人类在迈向幸福时所创造的‘宝中之宝’”。
    今天下午，赖莎还兴致勃勃地参观了天坛公园。
