In the suburbs of Kohima, India, there lives a family with over a hundred children. The matriarch, Zabtu Angami, is a midwife at a maternity hospital. At 42 years old, she has been taking in these children as foster children for over a decade. Currently, the youngest child is only 1 year old, while the rest are all in school, with the five oldest children being 16 years old.

Angami began taking in abandoned newborns in 1972. What was once her solitary residence is now packed like a beehive. The older children are responsible for maintaining order and caring for their younger siblings. The children also often help out in the vegetable garden with tasks they can handle and raise some poultry.

This resilient woman supports the entire family with her own income, never seeking help from any quarter. It was only a year ago that the local government named this family "Angami Auntie's Children's Home" and allocated 63,000 rupees for educational expenses. Now, Angami is both the auntie of the children's home and the mother of the children.

　　百余子女的大家庭
    印度科希马市的郊外，住着一个有１００多个孩子的大家庭，女主人扎布图·安嘎米是产科医院的助产士，今年４２岁，她义务收养这些孩子已有十几年的历史。目前最小的孩子只有１岁，其余的孩子都上学了，其中５个最大的孩子已满１６岁。
    安嘎米从１９７２年开始抚养被遗弃的新生儿，曾经是她一个人居住的住宅，现在像蜂房一样挤得满满的。大孩子负责维持秩序，照护弟妹。孩子们还经常在菜园里干些力所能及的活，并饲养了一些家禽。
    这位坚强的妇女依靠自己的收入维持这个大家庭的生活，她没有求助过任何方面的帮助。只是在一年前，当地政府才给这个家庭起名叫“安嗄米阿姨儿童院”，并且拨款６．３万卢比，用于教育儿童费用的支出，现在安嘎米既是儿童院的阿姨，又是孩子们的母亲。
