A code that is nearly two centuries old is clearly not suited to today's society. Yesterday afternoon, the French Senate began formal discussions on revising the Napoleonic Code. According to the work plan, this code will be revised over the next five years, with the general principles section to be discussed until May 20th.

The Napoleonic Code was published in 1810. The drafters could not have foreseen the series of modern crimes such as hijacking, drug trafficking, and incitement to crime that would occur more than a century later. As a code that has been used in this country for over 100 years, the French judicial system has long felt that it is "difficult to adapt to today's society." According to an order issued in November 1974, the French Senate established a special committee to oversee the revision of the Napoleonic Code.

Compared to the current criminal law, the revised draft has many significant changes. Out of the original 477 articles, over 300 have been revised, making for a substantial amount of work. Some outdated criminal charges, such as begging and vagrancy, have been removed, and behaviors that were previously considered criminal have been reclassified as illegal. Additionally, new criminal charges have been added, and the original 20-year imprisonment period has been increased to 30 years, with the maximum fine amounting to 5 million francs. The revised draft also proposes holding accomplices criminally responsible, abolishing sentences of only a few months, and advocating for "no minimum sentence."

The revision of the Napoleonic Code has garnered attention from French society. While the Socialist Party government has shown great enthusiasm for this, the opposition has proposed "throwing this draft into the historical trash bin." Some judicial officials are concerned that the new code may provide loopholes for certain criminals to evade punishment. This five-year revision process will spark a prolonged and heated debate in the French Parliament.

### 法国开始修订《拿破仑法典》

　　法国开始修订《拿破仑法典》
    本报巴黎５月１０日电  记者吕网大报道：一部年近两个世纪的法典在当今社会已明显不适应，法国参议院昨天下午起正式开始讨论修订拿破仑法典。根据工作计划，这部法典将在５年内修订完毕，其中总纲部分讨论至本月２０日告一段落。
    拿破仑法典于１８１０年问世。制订者当初未能料到百余年后所发生的劫机、贩毒、教唆犯罪等一系列现代犯罪活动。作为这个国家１００多年沿袭使用的法典，法国司法部门早已感到它“难于适应当今的社会”。根据１９７４年１１月的一项法令，法国参议院成立了一个专门委员会主持拿破仑法典的修订工作。
    与目前使用的刑法相比，刑法修订草案有不少重大改变。在原有４７７个条款中，修订之处就有３００多条，工程量颇大，其中取消了一些陈旧的犯罪指控，如行乞、流浪等，将原来属犯罪行为的改为违法，同时增加了一些新的犯罪指控，并把原来的２０年监禁期增加到３０年，处罚金额最高可达５００万法郎。修订草案还建议追究教唆犯的刑事责任，取消仅几个月的刑期，主张“下不保底”。
    拿破仑法典的修订工作得到法国社会的关注。在社会党政府对此表示极大热忱的同时，反对派则提出“把这个草案扔进历史垃圾箱”。一些司法官员担心新的法典会给某些犯罪分子开脱罪责。这项为期５年的修订工作将在法国议会中引起一场持久而又热烈的争论。
