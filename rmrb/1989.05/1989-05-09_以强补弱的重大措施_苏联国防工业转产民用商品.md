The Soviet Union is renowned worldwide for its advanced technology in the fields of aviation and aerospace. However, its production technology for civilian consumer goods is relatively backward, creating a stark contrast between the two. How to gradually narrow and ultimately eliminate this gap, and elevate the production of civilian consumer goods, is an important issue in the current Soviet economic reforms.

In the past, the Soviet Union prioritized heavy industry while neglecting light industry, which restricted the development of light industry and the food industry. Later, to compete with the United States in the arms race, a large amount of manpower, material resources, and financial resources were concentrated in the military industry, allowing military enterprises to develop preferentially. Additionally, the Soviet defense industry system implemented a strict secrecy policy, prohibiting the transfer of advanced military technologies to civilian use, thus resulting in a significant lag in civilian industry compared to the defense industry.

In the current reforms, to allow the broad masses to quickly feel the benefits of reform, the Soviet Union has decided to prioritize the development of food industry, agricultural product processing, and light textile industry, which are closely related to people's lives. However, the technological foundation of these industries is relatively backward. Even with increased state investment, it is difficult for them to reverse the backward situation on their own in the short term.

The current improvement in Soviet-American relations, shifting from confrontation to dialogue, and the general easing of international relations, provide a favorable external environment for the Soviet Union to integrate and develop its defense industry and civilian industry. The Soviet Union has decided to seize this opportunity, reduce military spending, and use the strong defense industry to support the civilian industry. It is estimated that the Soviet Union's decision to reduce its military by 500,000 personnel within two years will save 14.2% of military expenses, amounting to approximately 3 billion rubles. Just by halting the production of intermediate-range missiles, 3 billion rubles can be saved. In the context of this year's fiscal deficit reaching 35 billion rubles, this sum of money is undoubtedly a timely relief.

To ensure the smooth implementation of this policy, the Soviet Union has also formulated an 8-year plan (1988-1995), requiring a total of 37 billion rubles, of which 17.5 billion rubles will be borne by the defense system. This will involve the establishment of 29,000 agricultural product processing enterprises, the technological renovation of 38,000 old enterprises, and a 2.9-fold increase in the technological equipment for food industry production. The most important aspect is to improve the technological level of this equipment. Currently, only 1/4 of the equipment produced meets modern standards. To this end, 4,500 new types of machinery need to be developed and manufactured, of which 3,000 will be undertaken by the military industry departments. There are 200 military equipment research institutions participating in the development work, and 345 military enterprises have already started producing civilian goods. According to the 8-year plan, more than 140 types of complex daily necessities, such as laser digital displays and record players, will also be developed.

According to Soviet Defense Minister Yefimov, this year the output value of daily consumer goods produced by military enterprises will reach 4.5 billion rubles, accounting for half of their total output. Currently, all color televisions, 95% of refrigerators, and 69% of vacuum cleaners in the Soviet Union are produced by military enterprises. The Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, famous for manufacturing the SS-20 missile, has an annual production capacity of 400,000 washing machines and 260,000 children's cars. It also produces new automatic machine tools, milk disinfection and cooling equipment, livestock processing equipment, and beverage bottling production lines. The Moscow Red Banner Machine Building Plant, known for producing the MiG-29 fighter jet and the Il-18 passenger aircraft, has launched "MiG" brand civilian machinery, such as food processing machinery and juice extractors.

The production of civilian goods by military enterprises is not a new phenomenon. As early as the Khrushchev era, some military enterprises produced consumer goods such as refrigerators. However, at that time, enterprise leaders only regarded this task as a sideline and did not pay much attention to it. Now, military enterprises are also implementing reforms, fully mobilizing their potential and initiative, strengthening the production of civilian goods, and the phenomenon of shortages in daily necessities and food is expected to be alleviated.

The Soviet Aviation Industry Department has opened a store named after the Greek mythological hero "Antaeus" in Saratov, specializing in the sale of civilian machinery, including 265 types of products such as electric separators, water pumps, inter-row cultivators, power pulleys, sports equipment, and radio instruments.

　　以强补弱的重大措施    
    ——苏联国防工业转产民用商品
    周象光
    苏联在航空、航天领域的科技成就在全世界居于领先地位，是举世公认的。可是，在民用消费品领域的生产技术却相对落后，两者之间形成了鲜明的对照。如何逐步缩小以至消灭两者之间的差距，把民用消费品生产搞上去，是苏联当前经济改革中所要解决的一个重要问题。
    由于过去苏联执行重视重工业、轻视轻工业的方针，限制了轻工业、食品工业的发展。后来，为了同美国进行军备竞赛，又把大批人力、物力、财力集中使用于军事工业领域，使军工企业得到优先发展。加之苏联的国防工业系统实行严格的保密制度，禁止军工领域的先进技术转入民用，从而造成民用工业大大落后于国防工业的状态。
    在当前的改革中，为了使广大群众尽快地感受到改革带来的实惠，苏联决定优先发展与人民生活息息相关的食品工业、农产品加工业和轻纺工业。但是，这些工业的技术基础比较落后，即使国家增加投资，也难以靠自身的力量在短期内扭转落后的局面。
    当前苏美关系由对抗走向对话、国际关系日趋缓和为苏联实现国防工业和民用工业的融合和发展消费品工业提供了良好的外部环境。苏联决定抓住这个有利时机，削减军备，让实力雄厚的国防工业支持民用工业。据估计，苏联决定两年内裁军５０万的措施，可节省军费１４．２％，约合３０亿卢布。仅停产中程导弹一项，就可节省３亿卢布。在今年财政预算赤字高达３５０亿卢布的情况下，这笔资金无疑是“雪中送炭”。
    为保证该政策顺利实现，苏联还制订了一项８年计划（１９８８—１９９５年），共需资金３７０亿卢布，其中的１７５亿卢布将由国防系统承担，将兴建２．９万家农产品加工企业，对３．８万家老企业进行技术改装，为食品工业生产的技术装备将增加２．９倍，其中最重要的是提高这种设备的技术水平。因为目前生产的这类设备只有１／４符合现代化的要求。为此，要研制和开发４５００种新式机械，其中的３０００种由军工部门承担。有２００家军事装备的研究机构参加研制工作，有３４５家军工企业已经开始生产民用品。根据８年计划，还将开发１４０多种复杂的日用品，如激光数字显示，电唱机等。
    据苏联国防部长菲诺格诺夫透露，今年军工企业日用消费品的产值将达４５亿卢布，占其总产值的一半。现在，苏联全部的彩色电视机、９５％的电冰箱和６９％的吸尘器都是军工企业生产的。以制造ＳＳ—２０导弹闻名的沃特金斯克机器制造厂已形成了年产４０万台洗衣机和２６万台儿童车的生产能力，同时还生产新型自动机床、牛奶消毒冷却设备、畜牧加工成套设备以及饮料装瓶生产线。以生产米格—２９歼击机和伊尔—１８型客机著称的莫斯科红旗机械厂，已经推出了“米格”牌的民用机械，如食品加工机械、果汁挤压器等。
    军工企业生产民用品并非始自今天。早在赫鲁晓夫时代就有一些军工企业生产电冰箱等消费品。但是，那时的企业领导人只把这项任务视为副业，并不重视。现在，军工企业也在推行改革，充分调动它们的潜力和积极性，加强民品生产，日用消费品和食品供不应求的现象可望得到缓解。

    苏联航空工业部在萨拉托夫市开设了一家以希腊神话英雄“安泰”为字号的商店，专门出售民用机械，如电动分离机、水泵、中耕机、动力滑轮以及体育运动器材和无线电仪器等265种商品。
