During our visit to Qiping County in western Shandong, we met two village Party branch secretaries, one named Shēn Wàngcái and the other Dù Cúnshān. They have dedicated themselves to transforming the poverty-stricken appearance of their hometowns, putting aside personal gains and losses, and strictly disciplining themselves. They have led their impoverished and chaotic villages to prosperity, earning the title of "local sage" from the farmers!

**Digging for Gold in the Alkaline Soil**

This spring, Qiping County completed the construction of a cotton spinning mill with 50,000 spindles. Who would be the right person to manage this large enterprise, which embodies the collective efforts of the entire county? The county committee members weighed the options and unanimously agreed to entrust the task to Shēn Wàngcái, the Party branch secretary of Hépān Village in Chengguan Town.

However, when the county secretary personally visited Shēn Wàngcái to invite him to take on the responsibility, this farmer in his fifties politely declined. He sincerely said, "The affairs of Hépān Village need me, and I cannot leave Hépān Village!" Seeing his resolute attitude, the county secretary nodded in agreement. This time, it was the fourth time Shēn Wàngcái had declined the opportunity to "leave the farm."

In fact, Shēn Wàngcái's hometown is a well-known alkaline soil area in the western Shandong plain. Ten years ago, some of the villagers were still begging for food. Even Shēn Wàngcái himself had once pushed a cart to neighboring counties to work as a day laborer. It was this poverty-stricken situation that ignited the passion in this village cadre, who had served in the Korean War and joined the Party in 1959, to eradicate poverty.

There was a craftsman in Hépān Village named Hé Liánmíng. During the period of "cutting off the capitalist tail," his skills were not fully utilized, and due to poverty, his son could not even find a wife. After the policies were relaxed, Hé Liánmíng saw hope again and wanted to establish a weaving factory. However, he lacked capital and machinery. When Shēn Wàngcái learned about this, he went to Hé Liánmíng and said, "Liánmíng, you don't need to worry. I will help you find a way to get the funds and machinery!" Afterwards, he acted as a guarantor to help Hé Liánmíng secure a loan from the bank and then assisted him in acquiring the necessary machinery.

Hépān Village is located on the outskirts of the county seat, with an average of only 7.5 mu of land per person. Shēn Wàngcái had long realized that relying solely on farming was not enough. He vigorously supported the villagers in engaging in individual businesses while also exploring ways to establish village-run enterprises. Over the past four to five years, Shēn Wàngcái led the entire village in hard work, gradually establishing a weaving factory, a fiberglass factory, a soda factory, a moving company, a construction team, a transportation company, a recycling station, and a comprehensive commercial building. These efforts formed a production entity with fixed assets of over 4 million yuan, circulating funds of over 2 million yuan, and an annual output value of 5 million yuan. The per capita income of the village reached 1,800 yuan, with over 90% of the households having savings of over 10,000 yuan. Hépān Village has become the wealthiest village in the county, truly eradicating poverty.

**Three Times Giving Up the Homestead**

Féngguān Town's Jīndù Village in Qiping County is a notorious "troublemaker's nest." The village was plagued by fights and thefts, and several Party branch secretaries had failed to rectify the situation. Finally, the responsibility fell to the then 29-year-old Party member Dù Cúnshān.

Dù Cúnshān was born into a beggar family. He is honest and kind-hearted but firm in his actions. In dealing with the chaos, he made a strong impression from the start.

The incident happened not long after Dù Cúnshān convened a village meeting to establish village regulations. At that time, his pig had not been properly watched and had run into the fields, eating some young crops, and was caught. Some people with dirty hands took this opportunity to spread rumors: "The secretary's pig is leading the way to eat young crops, and establishing village regulations is just for show!"

The next day, Dù Cúnshān notified the villagers to gather at the village square for a meeting. After all the villagers had assembled, Dù Cúnshān's wife carried a basket of corn cobs onto the stage. Dù Cúnshān said, "My pig ate the young crops yesterday. According to the regulations, it should be fined 80 pounds of corn cobs. I brought them today, and after the meeting, please let the accountant weigh them. In the future, whoever's pig or sheep eats the young crops will be fined according to this standard!" His words stunned the attendees. In the past, cadres who made mistakes would not admit them and would always seek special treatment. No one expected Dù Cúnshān to be so serious! Not long after, a deputy secretary's child went to Lǐwáng Village to steal something and was caught. He was brought to Dù Cúnshān, who fined him 80 kilograms of wheat as usual. From then on, various thefts in the village gradually stopped.

What moved the villagers the most was Dù Cúnshān's three instances of giving up his homestead:

In recent years, every family in Jīndù Village has built a new house, but Dù Cúnshān and his family still live in the old earthen house left by their ancestors. The villagers felt guilty and insisted on helping him choose a plot of land. However, just as Dù Cúnshān had bought wood and bricks to prepare for building a new house, villager Dù Xuélù came to him, saying that his son was getting married and needed a plot of land to build a house. Dù Cúnshān thought Dù Xuélù's reasoning was sound, so he discussed with his wife and gave up his prepared homestead to Dù Xuélù. Later, when all the vacant plots in the village were allocated, Dù Cúnshān found a large pit and decided to fill it with soil to build a house. He spent 500 yuan to finally fill the pit and build a new homestead. When he was about to build the new house again, the retired cadre Dù Jīnglún, who had worked outside for many years, returned to the village. Dù Jīnglún had worked outside for decades and had no place to stay upon his return. Dù Cúnshān thought: Old Dù meets the conditions for arranging a homestead, but he has no labor, and even if he is given a homestead, he cannot fill the soil. Therefore, he discussed with his wife again and gave up his filled homestead to Dù Jīnglún. His wife, upon hearing this, was so angry that she burst into tears, saying, "Last time you gave up the homestead, I agreed with you. This time you are giving away the homestead we worked so hard to fill, do you still want this family?" Dù Cúnshān patiently explained, "As a cadre, we should bear the losses when necessary. If we grab every good thing, how can the people trust us?" After giving up the homestead, Dù Cúnshān led his wife to a two-meter-deep foul-smelling pond in the village and pointed, saying, "Our house will be built here!" At the beginning of this year, he filled in the foul-smelling pond and built a new house.

　　农民心目中的“土圣人”   
    ——记茌平县两位农村党支部书记
    王志耘　洪道保
    我们在鲁西茌平县采访，先后见到了两位农村党支部书记，一个叫申望才，一个叫杜存山。他们为了改变家乡的贫穷面貌，不计个人进退，严于律己，使穷而乱的乡村脱贫致富，被农民称为“土圣人”！
    在碱窝里掏金
    今年开春，茌平县新建成一座拥有５万纱锭的棉纺厂。把这样一个凝聚全县人民心血的大企业交给谁管才放心呢？县委常委们掂量来掂量去，不约而同地把目光投到城关镇何潘村党支部书记申望才身上。
    然而，县委书记亲自登门请申望才“出山”，这位年过半百的泥腿子竟然谢绝了。他诚恳地说：“何潘的事业需要俺，俺可离不了何潘村！”县委书记见他态度坚决也就点头同意了。连这次算起，申望才已是４次谢绝“跳农门”了。
    其实，申望才的家乡是鲁西平原上有名的碱窝子。１０年前，这里的乡亲有的还没扔下讨饭棍。连申望才自己也曾推着板车到邻县打过短工。正是家乡这种贫穷状况，激发着这位抗美援朝战争时期当过兵、１９５９年入党的乡村干部拔穷根的热情。
    何潘村有个手艺人叫何连明，在“割资本主义尾巴”的年月，他的手艺发挥不出来，因为穷，儿子连个媳妇也说不上。放开搞活后何连明重新看到了希望，想办一个织纱布厂。但他既缺少本钱，又没有机器。这事让申望才知道后，他找到何连明说：“连明，你不用发愁，资金和机器我来帮你想办法！”此后，他以担保人身份到银行为何连明贷来一笔款，接着又帮连明联系机器。
    何潘地处县城郊区，人均只有７分多点地。申望才早就认定单靠土地里刨金不行。他一边大力扶持群众开展个体经营，一边又想方设法上村办企业。四、五年来，申望才带领全村群众苦干实干，陆续建成了织布厂、玻璃钢厂、制碱厂、搬运队、建筑队、运输公司、物资回收站、综合商业楼，形成了拥有固定资产４００多万元，流动资金２００多万，年创产值５００万元的农工贸联合生产实体。全村人均收入达到１８００元，９０％的户存款万元以上，何潘村变成了全县首屈一指的富裕村，真正拔掉了穷根子。
    三让宅基地
    茌平县冯官屯镇金杜村，是方圆有名的“乱子窝”。村子里打架斗殴成风，偷瓜摸枣的事屡见不鲜。几任党支部书记都没有治好这个“乱子窝”。最后担子丢给了当时年仅２９岁的党员杜存山。
    杜存山是讨饭出身，他人老实忠厚，但办事不含糊，在治乱中头几脚就踢得不同凡响。
    事情发生在杜存山召集全村人制定乡规民约不久。当时，他家的猪没看好，跑到村边的庄稼地里啃了几口青苗，被人抓住了。有些手脚不大干净的人便借这件事放风：“支部书记的猪带头啃青苗哩，制定乡规民约还不是装样子！”
    事情发生的第二天，杜存山通知村民到村头的场院开大会，全村几百号人到齐后，杜存山的妻子背着一篓玉米棒子走上台，杜存山说：“俺的猪昨天啃了青苗，按规定该罚８０斤棒子，俺今天带来了，待会儿请会计过过秤。今后，谁的猪羊啃青，就按这个标准罚谁！”一席话把到会的人震住了。过去当干部的有错不认错，还尽搞特殊化，没料想杜存山还动了真格的！事隔不久，一位副支书的孩子去李王村偷东西，被人逮住，送来找杜存山，他照例罚了８０公斤小麦。从此，村子里一些偷摸现象慢慢地治住了。
    最令村民感动的还是杜存山三让宅基地：
    这几年金杜村家家盖新房，可杜存山依然和家人住在祖上留下来的土坯房里。大伙实在过意不去，硬是帮他选了块地方。可是正当杜存山买了木材、砖瓦准备盖房时，村民杜学禄找到他，说自己的孩子大了，准备娶媳妇，需要一处宅基盖房子。杜存山觉得杜学禄说的在理，便和妻子商量把自己垫好的宅基地让给了杜学禄。后来村子里空宅基都划完了，杜存山便找了一个大洼坑，决定垫起土在上面盖房子。他花了５００元终于在大洼坑上垫起了一块新宅基。当他再度准备盖新房时，在外工作的老干部杜京伦退休回村。杜京伦在外工作了几十年，回到家没个落脚处，杜存山想：老杜符合安排宅基的条件，但他没劳力，即使划给他宅基地光拉土垫地他也办不了。于是他和爱人商量再次把自己垫好的宅基让给杜京伦。爱人听完气不打一处来，说：“上次让宅基地我依了你，这次又拿咱累死累活垫好的宅基地送人，你还要不要这个家？”说着说着就气得呜呜地哭起来。杜棒山耐心解释说：“咱当干部该吃亏的就要吃亏，有点好事就捞，群众还怎么信咱呢？”宅基地让出后，杜存山领着妻子来到村中一个两米深的大臭水塘前，用手一指说：“咱家的房子盖在这！”今年初他把臭水坑填平盖上了新房。
