Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 2nd.

	Over 4,000 students from various universities in Shanghai took to the streets this afternoon. It is understood that students from Fudan University and Tongji University marched along Siping Road and the Bund towards the city center's People's Square, where they joined students from East China Normal University who had arrived earlier. The procession carried banners with slogans such as "Uphold the Four Cardinal Principles" and "Demand Democracy and Freedom," chanting slogans along the way.

	By around 10 PM, the procession began to disperse.

	The Shanghai Municipal Government spokesperson commented on the student protest, stating that the demonstration was not reported to the public security authorities in advance, violating the relevant regulations on public demonstrations in Shanghai passed by the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee.

	The spokesperson said that the public security authorities dispatched police officers to do their utmost to maintain traffic order along the route of the procession, thereby reducing the congestion of public transportation in the city.

	The spokesperson also said that the patriotic enthusiasm of the students and their desire to point out shortcomings and errors in the government's work and call for improvements are understandable. However, using such protest methods is not conducive to solving problems. The spokesperson said that people can reflect the situation and offer suggestions to the government through various means such as discussions, dialogues, letters, visits, and reports.

	It is also reported that the Shanghai University Student Federation is organizing discussions and dialogues between some university students and relevant municipal leaders.

　　上海高校学生上街游行    
    市府认为广大学生爱国热情可以理解但示威方式不利于解决问题
    新华社上海５月２日电  上海部分高校的４０００多名学生，今天下午走出校门，上街游行。据了解，复旦大学、同济大学的部分学生，今天下午沿四平路、外滩，前往市中心的人民广场，与较早到达的华东师范大学部分学生会合。游行队伍中打着“坚持四项基本原则”、“要民主自由”等横幅标语，沿途呼喊口号。
    当晚十时左右，游行队伍逐渐离去。
    上海市人民政府发言人就部分高校学生上街游行一事发表谈话指出，这次游行事先未向公安部门申报，违反了上海市人大常委会通过的关于上海市公民游行示威的有关法规。
    这位发言人说，市公安部门派出干警，尽最大努力维持游行队伍途经地段的交通秩序，以减缓市内公共交通阻塞的状况。
    这位发言人还说，广大学生的爱国热情和对政府工作中的缺点错误提出意见、要求改进的愿望是可以理解的。但采用这种游行示威的方式不利于解决问题。这位发言人说，大家可以通过座谈对话、来信来访和举报等多种方式向政府反映情况，提出意见。
    另据介绍，上海市学联正在组织高校部分学生与市有关领导的座谈对话活动。
