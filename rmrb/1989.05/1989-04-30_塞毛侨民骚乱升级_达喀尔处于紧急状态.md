The riots against Mauritanian immigrants in Senegal have escalated, leading to the imposition of a state of emergency in the capital, Dakar.

The Xinhua News Agency reports from Dakar on April 28 that according to the Senegalese News Agency, the Minister of the Interior has issued an order declaring a state of emergency in the entire Dakar region, with a curfew from 10 PM to 5 AM.

This order was issued following the escalation of riots against Mauritanian immigrants in Dakar. The order stipulates that during the period of emergency rule, all movement of people and vehicles on public roads in the Dakar region is prohibited, and all demonstrations, marches, and gatherings of any kind are banned.

The state of emergency can be extended for an additional six days, but it only applies to the Dakar region and is enforced by the regional administrative authorities, the Director-General of the National Security Bureau, and the security forces.

It is reported that starting from this morning, incidents of expelling Mauritanian immigrants occurred in Dakar. According to informed sources, 20 to 30 Mauritanian immigrants were killed, and looting incidents occurred again in the city center and some residential areas. Security forces have been continuously using tear gas.

Senegal established an inter-ministerial committee consisting of 12 ministers and senior officials on the evening of the 27th to handle the reception and settlement of Senegalese immigrants returning from Mauritania.

In recent days, while looting incidents targeting Mauritanian immigrants' shops have occurred in Dakar, similar incidents have also taken place in Mauritania, targeting Senegalese immigrants. According to some news agencies, these riots have resulted in the deaths of 150 to 200 Senegalese and Mauritanian people, with over 600 injured.
