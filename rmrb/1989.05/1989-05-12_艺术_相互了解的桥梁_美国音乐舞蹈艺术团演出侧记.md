Art: A Bridge of Mutual Understanding – A Backstage Account of the U.S. Music and Dance Troupe's Performance

The U.S. Music and Dance Troupe performed in Shenzhen, adding much color to the Shenzhen and Zhuhai International Art Festival.

The troupe consists of 30 members from Texas, Florida, California, New York, Boston, and other places. They were temporarily organized and sacrificed substantial performance income to come to China. For many of them, China had long been a mysterious dream, distant and elusive. Upon learning that their long-held dream was about to come true, they joyfully danced and sang: "I'm going to China! I'm going to China!" In Shenzhen, their days were filled with songs. After a few performances, some of them hurried back to New York to fulfill their previously signed performance contracts.

They are all outstanding American artists, performing authentic American music and dance, Broadway dance, modern dance, tap dance, ballet, as well as American pop songs and Western country music. Some of the performances were specially created and choreographed for this art festival.

Patricia McBride is America's premier ballerina and a favorite student of the dance master Balanchine. Her solo performance, "The Death of the Princess," was a ballet specially choreographed by Balanchine for her before his death. It is based on Shakespeare's famous play "Hamlet," but does not emphasize the plot. Her dance is a unique vocabulary for interpreting music, highly acclaimed in the United States. This time, she performed it three times, during the opening ceremony and the solo performance, leaving us with an unforgettable impression.

Equally noteworthy is the tap dance.

This dance originated in Ireland. There, people danced in wooden clogs, which were heavy and produced rhythmic, powerful sounds when stomped. The British brought it to America. Americans combined it with African folk dances, developing it into a popular dance form across the United States.

The Manhattan Tap Dance Group participating in the art festival consists of four members, two men and two women. Their feet are extremely agile, striking the floor with sounds that you could almost feel as if their feet were replacing hands to strike drumbeats, using their feet to speak, with a strong sense of music. The rhythm is varied, exaggerated to the extreme, a high degree of unity between technique and entertainment. Vibrant and unrestrained.

Chinese dancer Zī Huáyún told the reporter: "This is a typical manifestation of the American spirit."

### 艺术——相互了解的桥梁——美国音乐舞蹈艺术团演出侧记

　　艺术——相互了解的桥梁   
    ——美国音乐舞蹈艺术团演出侧记
    本报记者  卢祖品  王楚
    美国音乐舞蹈艺术团在深圳演出，给深圳、珠海国际艺术节增色不少。
    全团成员３０名，分别来自得克萨斯、佛罗里达、加利福尼亚、纽约、波士顿等地，他们是临时组织起来，牺牲了丰厚的演出收入来到中国的。他们当中不少人，长期以来一直把中国当作神奇的梦，飘渺而遥远，一旦得知行将实现多年的梦想，便乐得手舞足蹈：“我要去中国啦，我要去中国啦！”到了深圳，终日歌声不断。几场演出结束，一些人便匆匆赶回纽约，履行他们早已签订了的演出合同。
    他们都是美国出色的艺术家，表演的都是地道的、纯正的美国音乐舞蹈、百老汇舞蹈、现代舞、踢跶舞、芭蕾舞以及美国流行曲和西部乡村歌曲等等。一些节目是为这次艺术节特意创作编排的。
    帕特丽莎·麦克布莱德是美国首屈一指的芭蕾舞演员，也是舞蹈大师巴兰钦的得意门生。她这次演出的独舞《公主之死》，是巴兰钦去世前专门为她创编的一个芭蕾舞蹈，取材于莎士比亚名剧《哈姆雷特》，但不大注重情节。她的舞蹈，是解释音乐的一种特殊语汇，在美国享有很高声誉，这一次，她分别在开幕式和专场演出中作了三次表演，给我们留下了难忘的印象。
    最引人注意的还有踢跶舞。
    这种舞蹈源于爱尔兰。那里的人穿着木屐舞蹈，鞋很重，跳起来发出有节奏的充满力度的声响。英国人把它带到美国。美国人把它同非洲民间舞蹈融合一起，发展成今天流行全美的一种舞蹈形式。
    参加艺术节的曼哈顿踢跶舞团，一共４人，男女各半。他们的脚板极为灵活，打击地板发出的声音，你甚至可以感觉到那是用脚来代替手击打鼓点，用脚来说话，具有很强的音乐感。节奏多变，夸张到了极大限度，是技巧和娱乐的高度统一。朝气蓬勃，不拘一格。
    我国舞蹈家资华筠告诉记者：“这是美国精神的典型体现。”
