	Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 27th.

	In early April this year, Luo Shanglin of the Hefei Post and Telecommunications Bureau bought 2 jin of wool yarn produced by the Hefei Dyeing and Weaving Factory at the Hefei Department Store. After weighing, it was found to be short by 1 liang and 1 qian. Luo immediately filled out a comment card. The store, after checking and verifying, confirmed that this batch of wool yarn was underweight. It immediately stopped selling the product to the public, apologized to Luo, and, according to the published consumer comment regulations, penalized the shortage by tenfold, awarding Luo 49.50 yuan.

	This incident occurred during the "Quality Supervision and Comment Month" activity at the Hefei Department Store. Recently, based on the issues raised by the public, the store has thoroughly cleaned up its procurement channels. Products with unregulated trademarks, no specific factory names, or lacking quality inspection certificates are strictly not allowed to be purchased. Already purchased products that do not meet quality standards have been cleared out.

	At the same time, the store has reaffirmed its five measures to take responsibility for consumers:

		— For high-end durable consumer goods purchased at the store, a "five-test" (test use, test view, test listen, test ride, test wear) and "three-guarantee" (guarantee repair, guarantee replacement, guarantee return) policy is strictly implemented.

		— For general items purchased at the store (excluding special items such as food and medicine), if they have not been used and do not affect resale, they can be returned or exchanged within half a month with the original receipt.

		— For products sold at the store, if the price is higher than that of the Dazhong Store in the city under the same conditions, customers can return the goods or get a refund of the price difference within a week from the date of purchase with the original receipt.

		— Ensure accurate weights and measures. Products sold using metrology at the store are subject to a "one short, ten penalized" policy.

		— Strictly prevent counterfeit and substandard products from entering the market through the store. If this causes harm to consumers, the store will compensate for the losses.

　　少一罚十　信誉至上
    合肥百货大楼维护消费者利益
    据新华社合肥５月２７日电  （记者姚燕戈）今年４月初，合肥市电信局罗尚林在合肥百货大楼买了２公斤合肥染织厂生产的毛线，校秤后少了一两一钱，当场填写了评议券，大楼经过检查核实，确认这批毛线计量不足，立即停止对外出售，同时，向罗尚林道歉，按公布的消费者评议条例，少一罚十，奖给罗尚林４９．５０元。
    这是发生在合肥市百货大楼开展“商品质量监督评议月”活动中的一件事。最近这家百货大楼根据群众评议出的问题，认真清理了进货渠道，对商标不合规定，产品无具体厂名、缺少质量检验合格证明的产品一律不准进货；已经购进的不合质量标准的商品清理出去。
    与此同时，重申大楼对消费者负责的五条措施：
    ——凡在大楼购买的高档耐用消费品坚持实行“五试”（试用、试看、试听、试骑、试穿）、三包（包修、包换、包退）。
    ——凡在大楼购买的用品（特殊品种如食品、药品等除外），没有使用过、不影响第二次出售的，半个月内均可凭发票进行退换。
    ——大楼出售的商品；如在同等条件下价格高于市里大中国营商店的，自购物之日起，一周内可持发票来办理退还差价或退货手续。
    ——保证秤准尺足，大楼使用度量衡出售的商品，一律实行少一罚十。
    ——严防假冒伪劣商品从大楼流入市场，如果因此损害消费者利益，大楼负责补偿损失。
