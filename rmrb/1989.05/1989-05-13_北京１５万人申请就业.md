The number of people applying for jobs in Beijing has reached another peak. Gong Shujie, the director of the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, stated that this year, 150,000 people have applied for jobs.

The last significant job-seeking surge in the capital occurred in 1979. The return of educated youth from rural areas, combined with the large number of individuals born during the early 1960s reaching working age, resulted in 400,000 job seekers in Beijing at that time. By the end of 1984, the number of job seekers had decreased to just 1,600.

After a brief period of stability, the generation born during the decade of turmoil has once again disrupted the labor market's tranquility. Currently, a significant portion of graduates from junior and senior high schools who did not continue their education has swelled the ranks of the unemployed. Additionally, farmers whose land was requisitioned for Beijing's extensive construction projects have joined the unemployed, along with demobilized soldiers and children of out-of-town retirees who need to replace their parents in the workforce, forming this year's unemployed contingent in Beijing.

It is understood that after optimizing the structure of Beijing's enterprises, there are still 150,000 surplus workers within the city's enterprises. A large number of migrant workers have also occupied a considerable portion of the local labor market, with 650,000 farmers working in Beijing last year.

To accommodate this massive unemployed workforce, the Beijing Municipal Government has decided to allocate 10 million yuan as a job creation fund. Simultaneously, the government encourages young people to seek employment on their own. Furthermore, the government plans to regulate the migrant worker population, aiming to reduce it by 200,000 this year. Despite these measures, Beijing's unemployed youth remain selective about their job choices, unwilling to work as miners, construction workers, or even as bus drivers.

### 北京１５万人申请就业

　　北京１５万人申请就业
    本报讯  北京市申请就业人数又一次出现高峰。该市劳动局长龚树基说，今年申请就业的人数达１５万人。
    京城另一次就业高峰出现在１９７９年。下乡知识青年返城，以及６０年代初生育高峰降世的婴儿进入谋生年龄，使当时北京申请就业人数高达４０万。到１９８４年底，申请就业者仅剩１６００人。
    在短暂的安稳过后，十年动乱生育高峰时出生的一代又一次打破了劳动就业部门的平静，如今初、高中毕业又未能继续升学的大部分学子，使待业队伍迅速膨胀。此外，被北京大兴土木所征用了土地的众多农民也加入了待业的行列，再算上复员转业军人、身边无人需来京顶替退休人员的外地子女，构成了今年北京的待业大军。
    据了解，北京企业优化组合后，全市企业内剩余人员已有１５万；大量的农民工又占领了本市相当部分劳务市场，去年在北京做工的农民达６５万。
    为安置这支庞大的待业队伍，北京市府决定拿出１０００万元作为扶持就业基金，同时鼓励青年人自谋职业。此外市府已准备整顿外地民工队伍，今年计划压缩２０万人。尽管如此，北京待业青年对职业的选择却十分挑剔，不愿当矿工、建筑工，甚至连开公共汽车也不愿。
