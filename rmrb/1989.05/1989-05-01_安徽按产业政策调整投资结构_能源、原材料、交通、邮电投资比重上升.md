Anhui Province has prioritized industrial coordination, actively reduced investment scales, and adjusted investment structures.

Since the second half of last year, Anhui Province has focused on reducing fixed asset investment as a key aspect of its rectification and adjustment efforts. By the middle of March this year, a total of 485 projects had been either halted or delayed, resulting in a reduction of 99.4 million yuan in investment.

In accordance with industrial policies, Anhui Province has cleaned up construction projects and reduced investment scales, effectively adjusting the investment structure. Last year, the proportion of productive construction investment in the province increased by 1.5% compared to the previous year. The investment proportions for energy, raw materials, transportation, and telecommunications also rose. Among the 10 key projects identified by the province, most have been completed or put into operation. Notably, the first unit of the Pingzhen Power Plant, which has the largest single-unit capacity in the country, has been connected to the grid and is generating electricity. Additionally, 1,029 technical renovation projects have been completed and put into operation, with a total investment of 252 million yuan in technical renovations, a 20.3% increase from the previous year. This has expanded the production capacity of marketable products.

    据新华社合肥５月１日电  （记者王正忠）安徽省以产业协调为原则，积极压缩投资规模，调整投资结构。
