White jasmine and pink roses are in full bloom, and the elegant streets of Casablanca are adorned with the flags of the Arab League countries, including Egypt. The emergency summit of Arab heads of state is about to convene in this famous Atlantic port of Morocco.

Nearly 900 Arab and international journalists from various countries in the Middle East have gathered here. The clattering telex machines are rapidly transmitting every new development in the preparations for this summit.

It has been ten years since the heads of Arab states have had such hope of sitting together. The yearning for unity stirs the hearts of the Arab people. Today, the headlines in local newspapers read: "If this summit achieves the great reunion of Arab states, it will be a great victory for the nation."

This is indeed a breakthrough. For the first time in 11 years, an Arab League foreign ministers' meeting with the participation of Egypt's foreign minister is being held today to prepare the agenda for the summit.

It is reported that the decisions to have Egypt formally return to the Arab League, to discuss and adopt the Middle East peace plan proposed by the PLO, to ease the Lebanese crisis, and to promote the final reconciliation between Iran and Iraq are the four main themes of this summit. Arab unity is the underlying theme.

Egypt's formal return to the Arab League at this summit is a done deal. President Mubarak is undoubtedly the most prominent figure in the news. In the past two months, Arab leaders have frequently consulted, and with the exception of Libya, all countries have essentially reached a consensus on this once highly sensitive issue. The reporter clearly feels that the historical entanglements of the past ten years in the Arab world are being replaced by a rational attitude of reconciliation.

A journalist colleague from a Gulf state, who a few years ago wrote articles criticizing Egypt's unilateral peace agreement with Israel, has now shifted his focus to evaluating Egypt's leading role in the Arab camp. To be honest, the winds of the Arab world are indeed changing, becoming more realistic and more moderate.

Related to this, what decisions the Arab League will make on the Palestinian issue after Egypt's return has become even more noteworthy. Since the leaders of Egypt, Israel, and Jordan visited the United States in April, the Middle East situation has been at a critical juncture. Arab countries are vigorously advocating for a Middle East peace conference, while Israel has proposed an election plan for the occupied territories, and the United States has supported it. According to the PLO representative delegation, the PLO has submitted a seven-point working paper to this summit, hoping that Arab countries will have a formal unified stance on the current Middle East situation.

The summit is approaching, and it is still unknown whether Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi can be persuaded by Arab friendly neighbors to attend. Last week, the Syrian government approved Egypt's return to the Arab League, and a refreshing breeze has blown through the relations between Syria and Egypt. Arab journalists estimate that they can capture a photo of the two presidents shaking hands for the first time in ten years.

"We would rather see the 'family portrait' of the entire Arab family," Arab journalists said to the reporter with a touch of humor.

### 理智　和解　磋商  争取阿拉伯国家团结

　　理智　和解　磋商
    争取阿拉伯国家团结
    本报记者  林皎明
    乳白色的夹竹桃和玫瑰红的蔷薇争芳吐艳，幽雅的卡萨布兰卡街头悬挂起包括埃及在内的阿拉伯联盟各国国旗。本届阿拉伯紧急首脑会议即将在摩洛哥这个著名大西洋商港召开。
    近９００名阿拉伯和世界各国驻中东记者已云集在这里。哒哒作响的电传机向外迅速传播着本届首脑会筹备工作的每一步新进展。
    阿拉伯各国元首已有十年未像现在这样有希望坐到一起来。渴望团结的民族情绪激动着阿拉伯人的心。今天，当地报纸的头条标题写到：“如果这次会议实现阿拉伯国家大团圆，将是民族的伟大胜利。”
    这确实是一次突破，１１年来第一次有埃及外长参加的阿盟外长会议今天召开，筹备首脑会的工作议程。
    据透露，决定埃及正式回归阿盟、讨论通过巴解组织提出的中东和平方案、缓解黎巴嫩危机和促使两伊最终和解是本届首脑会的４个主题。阿拉伯团结，是贯穿其间的主旋律。
    埃及在这次会议上正式回归阿拉伯联盟，已成定局。穆巴拉克总统不言而喻地成为突出新闻人物。近两个月来，阿拉伯各国元首频繁磋商，除利比亚以外的各国实际上已经就这个曾经是极为敏感的问题达成一致。记者明显感觉到，阿拉伯过去１０年的历史纠葛正被理智的和解态度所取代。
    一位海湾国家记者同行，几年前还在撰文抨击埃及单独与以色列媾和的立场，如今笔锋已转向评价埃及在阿拉伯阵营的主导作用。凭心而论，阿拉伯世界的风向确实在变，变得越来越现实，越来越温和。
    与此相关，埃及回归后的阿盟将对巴勒斯坦问题做出什么决议，就变得更加引人注目。自４月份埃、以、约３国领导人访美以来，中东局势处于关键十字路口。阿拉伯国家竭力倡导中东和会，而以色列提出被占领土选举方案，美国附和。据巴解组织代表团透露，巴解向这次首脑会议提出一份７点工作文件，期望阿拉伯国家对中东目前时局有正式统一立场。
    首脑会议正在临近，利比亚国家元首卡扎菲能否被阿拉伯友好邻国劝说出席，至今还不得而知。叙利亚政府上周对埃及回归阿盟首肯，叙埃两国关系吹进一股爽人的春风。阿拉伯各国记者估计能拍下一张叙埃两位总统１０年不遇的握手照片。
    “我们更愿意看到阿拉伯大家庭那张‘全家福’的大照片”，阿拉伯记者不无风趣地对记者说。
