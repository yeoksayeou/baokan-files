Some enterprises in Changsha City are facing financial difficulties, with no funds available in their accounts. To address the problem of employees seeking medical treatment and hospitalization, they issue blank checks and use other delaying tactics to deal with employees and hospitals, causing many inconveniences for the hospitals. According to investigations, just the First Affiliated Hospital of Hunan Medical University had over ten million yuan in unpaid medical fees last year, with a significant portion of that amount now deemed unrecoverable. This year, the trend continues to rise.

　　长沙有的企业拖欠医疗费
    长沙市有的企业资金紧缺，帐上无钱，为了解决职工看病住院的难题，他们采取开空头支票和付委的办法应付职工和医院，给医院工作带来了许多麻烦。据调查，仅湖南医科大学附属第一医院，去年病人拖欠款达十万多元，且有相当一部分已无法收回，今年仍有上升趋势。
