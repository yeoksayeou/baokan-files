Title: "This is what is meant by the parents of the people, who can protect my descendants"

This is a couplet I saw on a pillar in a small temple dedicated to the Earth God in the countryside of Yantai when I was young.

Now, there are hundreds of thousands of my descendants suffering in Tiananmen Square. When will this suffering end?

I fully agree with the public letter issued by the ten university presidents in Beijing, which states: "We hope that the main leaders of the Party and the government (the emphasis is mine—Bing Xin's note) will meet with the students as soon as possible for a direct dialogue."

I believe that if one or two of the main leaders of the Party and the government appear on Tiananmen Square and say just a few words of sympathy and understanding to the hundreds of thousands of people, it will guide the situation towards a rational and orderly direction. Then, our descendants will not have to pay an unnecessary and heavy price.

Here, I urge today's parents of the people to come and protect "my descendants" as soon as possible!

### “此谓民之父母，以能保我子孙”

　　“此谓民之父母，以能保我子孙”
    冰心
    这是两句我小时在烟台农村里很小的一座土地庙里柱上看到的对联。
    现在天安门广场上有几十万受苦受难的我的子孙，这苦难何时才能了结？
    我极其赞成北京十位大学校长发表的公开信内说的：“我们希望党和政府的主要负责人（注重点是我加的——冰心注）尽快与同学们直接见面和对话”。
    我认为现在只要有一两位党和政府的主要领导人在天安门上露面，向几十万群众哪怕说一两句同情理解的知心话，就会引导事态向着理智、秩序的方向发展，那么，我们的子孙们就不必付出不必要的惨重的代价。
    在这里我请求今天的民之父母们，尽快地来保“我的子孙”们吧！
