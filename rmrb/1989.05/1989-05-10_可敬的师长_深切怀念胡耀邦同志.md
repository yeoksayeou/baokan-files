	Respected Mentor
	— Deeply Missing Comrade Hu Yaobang
	Rè Dì

	On the morning of April 15, the great proletarian revolutionary, statesman, and outstanding leader of our Party, Comrade Hu Yaobang, passed away. The news of his death caused immense grief among the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet. As a Tibetan cadre who has personally benefited from Comrade Yaobang's care and nurturing, I deeply mourn his passing.

	During the 15 years I had the fortune to know Comrade Yaobang, whether he was in adversity and suffering persecution by the "Gang of Four" or busy with the affairs of the Party, he always maintained regular contact with me. His dedication to the revolutionary cause, his integrity, his straightforwardness, his uprightness, and his noble character of equality and friendship towards ethnic minorities left a deep impression on me.

	He once pointed out that one of the important tasks of our Party in ethnic regions is to cultivate a group of ethnic cadres with communist consciousness. In our interactions, I deeply felt the great concern and heartfelt efforts that our beloved and respected Comrade Yaobang devoted to nurturing the growth of ethnic minority cadres.

	In the first half of 1975, I had the honor of studying with Comrade Yaobang in the same class at the Central Party School. As a revolutionary senior with rich revolutionary experience, extensive knowledge, and high Marxist-Leninist theoretical attainment, he often instructed me to study scientific and cultural knowledge diligently and to learn Marxism-Leninism to continuously improve my ideological and theoretical level. During our busy study schedule, we often took walks together, exchanging thoughts. He often shared his personal experiences, telling me about the history of the Chinese revolution and the experiences of revolutionary struggles. When I encountered difficulties in my studies, I often sought his advice, and he always patiently explained things to me in a clear and understandable way. During the time we studied together, I not only learned a lot of knowledge and study methods, thought processes from him, but more importantly, I learned the spirit of loyalty to the Party's cause, the confidence in communism, and the spirit of dedication to struggle unceasingly, as well as the precious virtues of being sincere and straightforward in dealing with people. Over the 15 years, I often felt fortunate and proud to have the opportunity to study with such a revolutionary senior and respected elder.

	Later, when the "Gang of Four" were rampant, he was once again "overthrown," and even his home was under surveillance. Once, I came to Beijing from Tibet and specially visited him. He asked me, "Are you not afraid of the dogs outside the door?" I said, "If I were afraid, I wouldn't have come." He solemnly told me: You must persist in reading some Marxist and Leninist works, learn to distinguish right from wrong, and firmly grasp the correct direction in the mist. Despite being in adversity, he always maintained a clear mind and a strong revolutionary will. I deeply admired his noble character.

	After the "Gang of Four" were overthrown, every time I came to Beijing, he would arrange time to talk with me, giving me face-to-face instructions. He often spoke candidly with me about thoughts, perceptions, work methods, and leadership art, encouraging me to work boldly and continuously improve myself through practice. I remember one day in December 1976, in his home, we talked for a long time. We discussed his excitement after the fall of the "Gang of Four" and his views on the future of the Party and the country. He also told me: You should liberate your mind, broaden your horizons, and work hard. The Tibetan people are a hardworking, brave, and wise nation, an extraordinary nation. You and other ethnic cadres should wholeheartedly serve the Tibetan people and be good servants of the Tibetan people. After our talk, he led me into his study, letting me choose a few books to read. In his study filled with books, I was attracted by the rows of bookshelves and various books, and I was also impressed by his extensive reading and knowledge of ancient and modern times. His collection was very precious, and there were many books I liked, but I hesitated to ask for them. He smiled and said, "Since you are reluctant to ask, I will choose two for you." He took down two volumes of "Selected Letters of Lu Xun" from the bookshelf, walked to the desk, and wrote: "Last year we studied Marx and Lenin together, this year we meet again to celebrate the overthrow of the demons. I present you with two volumes of Lu Xun's letters, to guide you through the storms." After writing the inscription, he asked Li Zhao standing beside him, "What do you think?" Li Zhao smiled slightly in approval, and then Comrade Yaobang personally handed the books to me. At that time, I was very moved. I knew that these were not ordinary books but carried the sincere expectations and deep affection of the older generation of revolutionaries for us ethnic minority cadres. That night, at the insistence of Comrade Yaobang and his wife, we had dinner together. Although it was a simple meal, it was more delicious than any delicacy. During the meal, Comrade Yaobang toasted: To our reunion after the overthrow of the "Gang of Four"! After dinner, when I got up to leave, he noticed that my clothes were too thin, saying, "The weather is bad today, and you are dressed too lightly. My other clothes may not fit you, so wear this coat." Then he sent me back to my residence in his car. Back at my residence, my mind was turbulent for a long time. His earnest instructions, kind face, and sincere affection kept appearing in my mind.

	In 1984, once he saw me and said, "You should not be swayed by idle talk. The Party Central Committee and the organization understand you. Be bold in your work. It is not easy for our Party to cultivate an ethnic cadre. Do not disappoint the Party's expectations." He also encouraged Tibetan cadres who had grown up in many occasions, which greatly inspired me and other Tibetan cadres.

	From Comrade Yaobang, I deeply felt that our Party attaches great importance to cultivating and nurturing ethnic minority cadres and is very concerned about their growth. I also deeply felt that the Party's ethnic policies are truly policies to help ethnic minorities develop and progress, truly policies to make ethnic minorities the masters of their own affairs. Following the Communist Party is the only correct path for the prosperity and happiness of ethnic minorities.

	While actively promoting the rectification of wrongs nationwide, Comrade Yaobang paid great attention to the work in Tibet. He provided direct guidance for Tibet to eliminate the influence of the "Left," achieve rectification of wrongs, and accelerate reform and opening up. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he often told me: In Tibet, we must strive to overcome "Left" thinking and truly achieve rectification of wrongs and implement policies. Under the personal leadership of Comrade Yaobang, the Central Committee held two Tibet Work Conferences in 1980 and 1984. These two conferences fully reflected the Central Committee's high attention to Tibet's work and condensed Comrade Yaobang's great efforts and wisdom. I participated in both conferences and listened to Comrade Yaobang's important speeches on Tibet issues. He, with high theoretical courage, refuted the erroneous proposition that "the essence of the national question is the class question," providing a theoretical basis for opening up a new situation in ethnic work. He also, from the height of Marxist epistemology, proposed to "re-recognize" Tibet and profoundly analyzed the special nature of Tibet, providing powerful ideological weapons for us to deeply understand Tibet and work on Tibet from reality, which has important significance for Tibet's long-term development. Based on the actual situation in Tibet, the Central Committee formulated a series of policies and flexible measures at these two conferences that are suitable for Tibet's reality, beneficial to the development of Tibet's economy and culture, and conducive to strengthening national unity. These two conferences played a significant guiding and promoting role in promoting Tibet's rectification of wrongs, promoting economic and cultural development, improving people's lives, enhancing national unity, and accelerating the implementation of various policies.

	After the first Tibet Work Conference, to further understand the situation in Tibet, in May 1980, Comrade Yaobang and Comrade Wan Li, on behalf of the Central Committee, personally visited Tibet for an inspection. Comrade Yaobang pointed out that the Tibetan people are still very poor and their lives are still very difficult. The policy of the Central Committee is to address the issue of poverty and build a united, prosperous, and civilized new Tibet. He especially emphasized that first, we must concentrate our efforts and make full use of the special policies given to Tibet by the Central Committee to develop Tibet's economy in a realistic and flexible manner. Second, we must strengthen national unity. He said, unity is a necessary prerequisite. Without unity, how can there be development! Tibet is a single ethnic region, basically Tibetan, so the issue of unity in Tibet is mainly the relationship between the Han cadres who have entered Tibet and the broad Tibetan people. To help the Tibetan people get rid of poverty as soon as possible and rapidly develop Tibet's economy and culture, he proposed that Tibet's work should focus on "six major tasks": (1) fully exercising the autonomy of national regional autonomy; (2) firmly implementing the policy of rest and recuperation; (3) implementing special flexible policies; (4) developing agriculture, animal husbandry, and ethnic handicrafts; (5) vigorously developing Tibetan science and culture; (6) correctly implementing the Party's ethnic cadre policy. Comrade Yaobang's important speeches during the inspection hit the key points of Tibet's work, greatly inspiring and educating the broad cadres, workers, and masses in Tibet. Comrade Yaobang, despite the high-altitude reaction, went deep into the masses, listened to various opinions, worked tirelessly, and his diligent and solid work style left a deep impression on the cadres, masses, and people of all ethnic groups in Tibet.

	Comrade Yaobang cared about Tibet and often thought about Tibet's issues. He once told me: The fundamental issue of Tibet is to develop the national economy, national culture, strengthen national unity, and cultivate national cadres. To do well in Tibet's affairs, we must grasp these key issues. Since September 1987, Lhasa in Tibet has experienced several disturbances and riots by a few separatist elements attempting to split the motherland, and Comrade Yaobang was very concerned about the situation in Tibet. Last year, I went to Beijing twice, and each time he asked me in detail about the situation in various aspects after the disturbances in Lhasa.

	Comrade Yaobang's sudden departure is a great loss to the Party and the country, and it also means I have lost a respected mentor. I remember in late September last year, during the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, I brought my son, who was studying in Beijing, to visit Comrade Yaobang's home. He was very happy to receive us and had a heart-to-heart talk with me. Sometimes he asked about the situation in Tibet and the development of various undertakings in Tibet, sometimes he asked about my personal work, life, and family situation, and he also told my son, "Young man, study hard. Young people must forge their own path." We also took a group photo together. But I never imagined that this meeting would be our last, and this group photo would become a farewell memento! I will strive to learn and work harder, not to disappoint Comrade Yaobang's expectations, and to make contributions to the Party and the people to comfort his spirit.

　　可敬的师长    
    ——深切怀念胡耀邦同志
    热地
    ４月１５日晨，伟大的无产阶级革命家、政治家，我党卓越的领导人胡耀邦同志与世长辞，噩耗传来，西藏各族各界人民无比悲痛。我做为曾经亲身领受过耀邦同志关心和培养的藏族干部，对他的逝世表示深切地哀悼。
    在我与耀邦同志幸识的１５个春秋里，无论是他身处逆境、遭受“四人帮”迫害之时，还是他日理万机、主持全党工作的日子里，都与我保持经常的联系。他那为革命事业鞠躬尽瘁、廉洁奉公、为人耿直、一身正气和对兄弟民族平等友爱的高尚品德，给我留下了深刻的印象。
    他曾指出，我们党在民族地区一个十分重要的任务就是培养造就一批具有共产主义觉悟的民族干部。在我们的交往中，我深深地感受到我们爱戴和崇敬的耀邦同志，为培养少数民族干部的成长所给予的巨大关心和倾注的一腔心血。
    １９７５年上半年，我有幸与耀邦同志在中央党校读书班同窗共读。他作为具有丰富革命经验，渊博知识和较高马列主义理论素养的革命前辈，常常教诲我要学好科学文化知识，努力学习马列主义、不断提高思想理论水平。在紧张的学习之余，我们常常一起散步，彼此相互交流思想。他常用自己的亲身经历给我讲述中国革命的历史和革命斗争的经验，学习中遇到难题，我也常向他请教，他总是耐心地给我作深入浅出的讲解。在与他同学的日子里，我不仅从他那里学到了大量的知识和学习方法、思想方法，更重要的是学到了为党的事业忠心耿耿，对共产主义充满信心和为之奋斗不息的献身精神，以及处世为人，坦诚相待的可贵品德。１５年来，我常为自己有机会与他这样的革命前辈和令人尊敬的长者一起学习，感到庆幸和自豪。
    后来，“四人帮”横行，他被再次“打倒”，连他的家也被监视。有次我从西藏来京，专程登门拜访他，他问我：“门外有狗，你不怕吗？”我说：“怕，就不来了。”他语重心长地对我说：要坚持读点马列的书，学会明辨是非，在迷雾中牢牢把握住大方向。他身处逆境，却始终保持着清醒的头脑和坚强的革命意志。我深深地敬佩他那高尚的人品。
    粉碎“四人帮”后，我每到北京，他总是要安排时间与我谈事、谈心，当面教诲。他常推心置腹地与我谈思想，谈认识，教我工作方法和领导艺术，鼓励我大胆工作，在实践中不断提高自己。记得１９７６年１２月的一天，在他家里，我们谈了很长时间，谈了“四人帮”倒台后他的激动心情，也谈了他对日后党和国家前途的看法。他还对我说：你要解放思想，放开眼界，努力工作。藏民族是勤劳、勇敢、智慧的民族，是了不起的民族。你们这些民族干部要全心全意地为藏族人民办事，当好藏族人民的公仆。谈完话后，他领我走进他的书房，让我选几本书拿去读。在他那陈放满实的书房里，我被一排排书架上的各种书籍吸引住了，也被他博览群书，通晓古今的阅历所折服。他的藏书十分珍贵，我所喜爱的书也很多，但又难以张口。他满面笑容地说：“你不好意思张口，我就为你选两本。”说着从书架上取下两本《鲁迅书信集》（上下集），走到书桌前，伏案提笔在书上亲笔题词：“去年同窗钻马列，今年重逢庆诛妖。聊赠鲁迅书两卷，风雨途中辨航标。”
    耀邦同志写完题词，向站在身旁的李昭同志问道：“你看如何？”李昭同志微微一笑表示赞许，然后耀邦同志亲手将书赠予我。当时我的心情十分激动，我深知这不是普通的两本书，而是寄托着老一辈革命家对我们少数民族干部的殷切期望和无限深情。这天晚上，在耀邦同志和夫人的挽留下，我们一起吃晚饭。虽是一顿家常便饭，却胜似山珍海味。席间，耀邦同志举杯祝酒：为粉碎“四人帮”后的重逢干杯！饭后，我起座告辞，他见我穿的衣服单薄，说：“今天天气不好，你穿的太少，我的衣服别的你穿不合适，就把这件大衣穿上。”然后又用他的车送我回住处。回到住处，我的心情久久不能平静，他那谆谆的教诲、和蔼可亲的面容和真挚情谊，不时在我脑际闪现。
    １９８４年，一次他见我时说，你不要被闲言碎语左右，党中央和组织上是了解你的，要大胆工作，我们党培养一个民语干部是不容易的，你不要辜负党的期望。他还在许多场合对西藏新成长起来的藏族干部进行鼓励，使我和其他藏族干部深受鼓舞。
    从耀邦同志身上我深深感受到了我们党对培养和造就少数民族干部是非常重视的，对少数民族干部的成长是非常关心的，也深深感受到了党的民族政策是真正帮助少数民族发展进步的政策，真正使少数民族自己当家作主的政策，跟着共产党走是我们少数民族繁荣昌盛，幸福富裕的唯一正确道路。
    耀邦同志在积极推进全国范围的拨乱反正的同时，对西藏工作非常重视。他对西藏清除“左”的影响，实现拨乱反正，加速改革开放给予了直接指导。十一届三中全会后，他曾多次对我说：在西藏要努力克服“左”的思想，真正实现拨乱反正，搞好落实政策工作。在耀邦同志亲自主持下，中央于１９８０年和１９８４年先后两次召开西藏工作座谈会。这两个会议充分体现了党中央对西藏工作非常重视，也凝结着耀邦同志的大量心血和智慧。这两次会，我都参加了，聆听了耀邦同志就西藏问题作的重要讲话。他以高度的理论勇气，否定了“民族问题的实质是阶级问题”这一错误论断，为民族工作开创新局面提供了理论依据。他还从马克思主义认识论的高度提出要对西藏进行“再认识”，并精辟地分析了西藏的特殊性，为我们深刻认识西藏，从实际出发搞好西藏工作提供了有力的思想武器，对西藏的长远发展具有重要意义。根据西藏的实际情况，中央在这两次座谈会上为西藏制定了一系列符合实际，有利于西藏经济、文化发展，加强民族团结的特殊政策和灵活措施。这两次座谈会对促进西藏实现拨乱反正，推动经济、文化的发展，改善人民生活，增进民族团结，加速各项政策的落实，产生了重大的指导和推动作用。
    第一次西藏工作座谈会后，为了进一步深入了解西藏情况，１９８０年５月，耀邦同志和万里同志受中央委托，亲临西藏进行考察。耀邦同志指出，西藏人民现在还很穷、生活还很困难，我们党中央的政策就是要治一个“穷”字，建设一个团结的、富裕的、文明的新西藏。他特别强调，一要集中力量，充分利用中央给西藏的特殊政策，实事求是，因地制宜地发展西藏经济。二要加强民族团结。他说，团结是一个必要的前提条件，没有团结还能有什么发展！西藏是一个单一的民族地区，基本上是藏族，所以西藏的团结问题，主要是进藏汉族同志与广大藏族人民的关系问题。为了使西藏人民尽快摆脱贫困，西藏经济、文化迅速发展，他提出了西藏工作要抓好“六件大事”，（一）充分行使民族区域自治的自治权；（二）坚决实行休养生息的政策；（三）实行特殊灵活的政策；（四）发展农牧业和民族手工业；（五）大力发展藏族的科学文化事业；（六）正确执行党的民族干部政策。耀邦同志在考察期间所作的重要讲话，切中西藏工作的要害，极大地鼓舞和教育了西藏广大干部职工、群众。耀邦同志不顾高山反应，深入群众，倾听各方面的意见，忘我工作，他那勤奋、扎实的工作作风给西藏的干部、群众和各族各界人士留下了深刻的印象。
    耀邦同志关心西藏，也常思考西藏问题，他曾对我说：西藏的问题从根本上说，就是要发展民族经济、民族文化、加强民族团结、培养民族干部。要办好西藏的事，就必须抓住这些关键的问题。自从１９８７年９月以来，西藏拉萨连续出现多次少数分裂主义分子妄图分裂祖国的骚乱闹事，耀邦同志非常关心西藏的局势。去年，我两次到京，他每次见我，都详细询问拉萨发生骚乱后的各方面情况。
    耀邦同志匆匆离去，是党和国家的巨大损失，也使我失去了一位可敬的师长。记得去年９月下旬，党的十三届三中全会期间，我带着在京上学的儿子到耀邦同志家拜访，他很高兴地接待了我们，与我促膝交谈，兴致勃勃。一会儿询问西藏的局势，西藏各项事业发展情况，一会儿又问我个人的工作、生活和家庭情况，还对我儿子说：“小伙子，要好好学习，年轻人自己的路要自己闯。”我们又一起合影留念。但我万没想到，这次见面竟是最后的相会，这一合影竟成为永诀的留念！我要努力学习，加倍工作，不辜负耀邦同志的期望，用为党为人民多做贡献来告慰英灵。　　　　（本文作者为西藏自治区党委副书记）　（附图片）
