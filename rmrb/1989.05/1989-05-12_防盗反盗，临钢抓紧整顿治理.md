Edition: 6

On March 15, your newspaper's fifth edition published a letter and a reporter's investigation report reflecting the severe theft issues at our company, along with the "Editor's Note." This has caused a strong reaction within our company. On the day we received the newspaper, the company convened a joint meeting of the Party and the administration. We sincerely welcome the media's supervision by the Party and humbly accept the criticism, and have formulated improvement measures.

After the joint meeting, the company held a meeting of the second-level factory and department heads, deciding to first rectify the enterprise internally to block various loopholes that lawbreakers might exploit for theft and looting. In recent days, Tempco has launched a rectification and management campaign centered on anti-theft and counter-theft. At the same time, the company has decided to strengthen ties with local governments at all levels and effectively carry out community-based prevention and control work. We have already entrusted relevant departments to negotiate with the towns, villages, and the municipal government around Tempco to sign a joint defense agreement again. The Linfen Municipal Government will also take the lead in rectifying various purchasing stations and smelting furnaces to cut off the channels for criminals to fence stolen goods, effectively stopping illegal purchases.

　　防盗反盗，临钢抓紧整顿治理
    ３月１５日，你报第五版刊登反映我公司被偷盗严重的来信和记者的调查汇报及“编者的话”，在我公司上下引起强烈反响。接到报纸的当天，公司便召开党政联席会，我们真诚欢迎党报的舆论监督，虚心接受批评，并制定了改进措施。
    联席会后，公司召开了二级厂处长会议，决定首先从企业内部加以整治，堵塞不法分子偷抢的各种漏洞。近日来，临钢上下开展了以防盗反盗为中心的整顿治理活动。同时，公司还决定加强与各级地方政府的联系，切实搞好群防群治工作。现已委托有关部门与临钢周围的乡、镇、村以及市政府协商，再次签定联防公约，并由临汾市政府出面对各类收购站、化铁炉进行整顿，截断犯罪分子的销赃之路，坚决有效地制止非法收购。
