Martens is the longest-serving prime minister in Belgium's history, having been in office for over a century. He has formed cabinets eight times and has been in power for a decade, making him an unshakable figure in the political arena.

In April 1979, the Dutch-speaking Christian People's Party won the general election, and Martens, as the party chairman, was tasked with forming a cabinet at the age of just 42. The cabinet included many who had previously served as ministers, deputy prime ministers, and even prime ministers, making him feel "lacking in political experience" and "like a new recruit surrounded by a group of veterans."

However, after taking office, he initiated economic and political reforms, leading Belgium to achieve sustained and stable development over a decade. Recently, when asked about the "secret" to his governance, he replied that it was not about "secrets," but about making decisions that align with the national conditions and the wishes of the majority.

In his first year in office, Belgium was still grappling with the impact of the capitalist world economic crisis. By the end of 1980, the cabinet led by Martens proposed a series of measures to revitalize the economy and finance, such as: tightening public spending, strengthening enterprise competitiveness, devaluing the currency, promoting foreign trade, and improving the social security system. Although each step was met with endless debates, the ultimate result was beneficial to the country. Last year, Belgium's GDP grew by 3%, the best year in recent years. The inflation rate was one of the lowest among the EEC countries. In terms of per capita export value, it reached $6,720 in 1986, ranking first in the world.

Belgium has a population of one million, with three languages: Flemish, French, and German. There are many political factions, and the cabinet changes frequently. In April 1979, shortly after Martens took office, he began to reform the government system, establishing four regional governments and parliaments across the country to oversee cultural and educational affairs in their respective regions. Whenever conflicts arise between different language regions, he skillfully navigates between the factions to mediate disputes. Last August, he proposed the idea of a federal system, advocating for constitutional reform to promote regional autonomy and federalization.

Martens has headed various multi-party coalition governments. He patiently listens to the opinions of all factions and considers the interests of all parties. At the weekly cabinet meetings, he is always "prepared with multiple aces to deal with potential conflicts and ease tensions." When facing tough issues like budget allocations, the factions often refuse to compromise, but Martens, who has experience as a lawyer, always manages to navigate smoothly. He is known as a "magician who can pull rabbits out of a hat." His humble, kind, and sincere demeanor also helps him win the affection of others.

In 1983, Martens underwent a major heart surgery, but he continues to work tirelessly. He says, "Even on weekends or holidays, I look at the computer screen for telexes. I always keep an eye on whether government agreements are being implemented on schedule." His selfless work ethic has earned him the praise of the public.

### 比利时政坛的“不倒翁”

　　比利时政坛的“不倒翁”
    王淑娟
    马尔滕斯是比利时一百零五年以来在位最久的首相。他接连八度组阁，迄今已执政十载，在政坛上堪称是位“不倒翁”。
    一九七九年四月，荷语基督教人民党在大选中获胜，马尔滕斯作为该党主席受任组阁，年仅四十二岁。内阁中，当过部长、副首相甚至首相的人不少，他自觉“缺乏政治经验”，“像个被一群老兵团团围住的新入伍者”。
    可是，他上任后，着手经济和政治的改革，使比利时十年内取得持续稳定的发展。最近，有人问起他执政的“诀窍”，他回答是：靠“诀窍”不行，要靠符合国情、顺乎大多数人愿望的决策。
    马尔滕斯执政第一年，比利时尚未摆脱资本主义世界经济危机的影响。一九八○年底，他领导的内阁提出了一系列振兴经济和财政的措施，例如：紧缩公共开支，加强企业竞争活力，贬值货币，促进外贸，完善社会保险制度。尽管每走一步都伴随着无休止的争辩，但最终给国家带来的是好处。去年比利时国民生产总值增长百分之三，是近年来最好的一年。通膨率是欧共体诸国中较低的一个。按人均出口额计算，一九八六年就达六千七百二十美元，居世界之首。
    比利时人口一千万，讲弗拉芒语、法语、德语三种语言，政派颇多，内阁更迭频繁。一九七九年四月，马尔滕斯刚上任，便着手改革政府体制，在全国先后组建起四个地区政府和议会，负责本地区的文化和教育事业。每当不同语区之间出现风波，他便巧妙地周旋于各派之间，调解矛盾。去年八月，他提出了联邦制构想，主张改革宪法，推进区域自治和联邦化。
    马尔滕斯主持过各种倾向的多党联合政府。他能耐心地听取各派意见，考虑各方利益。在每周内阁例会上，他总是“准备多张王牌来应付会上可能出现的冲突，缓解紧张局势”。遇到讨论预算经费分配等棘手问题时，各派互不相让，但当过律师的马尔滕斯总能纵横捭阖，顺利过关。人称他是个“能从帽子里变出兔子的魔术师”。他待人谦逊，宽厚，挚诚，也有助于他赢得大家的好感。
    一九八三年，马尔滕斯动过一次心脏大手术，但他总是不知疲倦地工作。他说，即使周末或休假期间，“我也看电脑荧屏打出的电传。随时关注政府协议是否如期执行。”忘我的工作精神，使他获得了民众的称赞。
