According to a report by the China Forestry News on May 6, incomplete statistics show that in 1988, there were 1,820 incidents of assaults on forest rangers nationwide, an increase of 34.9% compared to 1987. A total of 512 forestry law enforcement officers were injured or disabled while on duty, with 3 fatalities.

In recent years, forestry law enforcement officers have faced numerous misfortunes. In 1988, 350 forestry law enforcement officers in Jiujiang, Jiangxi Province, were beaten and injured by timber thieves. In Shaanxi Province, over the past few years, more than 20 timber inspection officers have been severely injured, and 2 have been killed. Since 1985, 81 forest rangers in Shaoyang, Hunan Province, have been severely injured, with 2 fatalities.

The criminals who assault forestry law enforcement officers use extremely brutal methods. In Jiangxi Province, timber inspection officer Zhao Gaoshan was crushed to death by a truck while on duty at night. On the night of August 12 last year, more than 10 masked individuals beat the on-duty manager of the Yunshan Timber Inspection Station in Yongxiu County, Cai Guangsheng, and fled. Cai suffered three broken ribs and a broken leg, resulting in disability. In Jiangxi Province, Star City, Bailu Township, Rao Xilin and seven others illegally logged state-owned timber and were caught by forest rangers Guo Caishan and two others. Rao and his accomplices instead took the three forest rangers hostage to the village, gathered a group of people, stripped them of their clothes, and subjected them to torture such as "rolling in pine needles" and "pouring cold water," resulting in one person being disabled and two others severely injured. On the afternoon of February 4 this year, forest ranger Zhou Dayuan from Bolu Township, Beishan County, Chongqing, was severely injured while stopping a timber theft gang led by Wei Fafu from Daxian Township. Despite efforts to save him, he died. An elderly forestry law enforcement officer lamented, "I have spent my life protecting forests, but I myself do not receive any protection!"

　　护林员生命安全受严重威胁
    ５月６日《中国林业报》报道：据不完全统计，１９８８年全国发生殴打护林员案件１８２０起，比１９８７年增加３４．９％。林政人员在执行公务中被打伤、致残的达５１２人，其中被打死的有３人。
    近几年来，林政人员普遭厄运。江西九江市去年有３５０名林政人员被盗伐林木的歹徒殴打致伤；陕西省近几年被打成重伤的木材检查人员有２０多人，被打死的２人；湖南邵阳市１９８５年来有８１名护林员被打成重伤，２人被打死。
    殴打林政人员的犯罪分子手段残忍，令人发指。江西省乐安县木材检查员赵高山夜间执行公务时，被偷运木材的汽车压死；去年８月１２日深夜，１０多个蒙面人，将正在值班的永修县云山木材检查站站长骆光胜殴打后逃之夭夭，骆３根肋骨和一条腿被打断致残；江西星子县白鹿乡饶希林等７人盗伐国有林木，被护林员郭才山等３人当场抓获，饶等竟反将这３名护林员劫持到村里，纠集一帮人把他们衣服剥光，施以“滚杉针”、“浇冷水”等酷刑，使１人致残，２人重伤。今年２月４日下午，重庆市璧山县葫芦乡护林员周大元，在制止该县大沿乡村民魏发富为首的盗林团伙盗伐树木时被盗贼打成重伤，经抢救无效死亡。一名受害的老林政员感叹：我一辈子保护林木，可自己却得不到保护！
