Mo Ce's name is inseparable from water. Poet Ai Qing praised him as the "singer of water," while his peers call him the "son of water." A Japanese art critic put it more explicitly: "Mo Ce expresses the emotions of the Chinese people through water, and his characteristic is water, water, and still water!" Mo Ce's feelings for water run deep! He summed up his artistic career with a single sentence: Following the footsteps of water.

Frankly, water is the source of life, and it is also the source of Mo Ce's artistic creation. Without water, there would be no Mo Ce's prints; without water, there would be no Mo Ce's artistic life.

Mo Ce grew up in the watery countryside of Su North. The Huai River nurtured his life and cultivated his gentle and generous character. When he fell in love with woodcutting and learned to express his feelings through the language of prints, the polychromatic woodcut "Catching Fish," published in the People's Daily in 1955, was his first sincere offering to his mother river.

If Mo Ce's early works reflected more of the joy of the watery countryside farmers after gaining land and the author's nostalgia for the warm and beautiful scenery of his hometown, then as Mo Ce joined the water conservancy and power department and enthusiastically participated in the river management, he developed a new understanding of water, this substance that brings life to the world. He felt the deep and broad selfless spirit of the country's rivers, and also experienced the mighty power of the Chinese people to transform nature. His heart was shaken, and his inspiration was ignited. He poured his deep affection for water through his diligent carving knife, one work after another on the printing plate, year after year, unremitting...

Mo Ce, who follows the footsteps of water, seems to be more able to discover, appreciate, and capture the beauty within. That beauty is dual-natured: it has the tranquil beauty of a thousand feet deep in the peach blossom pool, and the vigorous and majestic beauty of the water released from a dam; it has the natural beauty of rivers and streams, and the artificial beauty of towering dams. Mo Ce scans them with the eyes of a water conservancy worker and an artist, so his feelings are unique and profound. The scenes reflected under his carving knife are sincere.

Following the footsteps of water, for more than 30 years, Mo Ce has created hundreds of works reflecting water conservancy construction. These works are full of strong contemporary atmosphere and contain strong aesthetic value. They not only record the great deeds of the descendants of Yu the Great in transforming mountains and rivers but also embody the author's understanding of life and pursuit of beauty. When he condenses his fervent feelings for water into his prints, he manifests a kind of gentle, tranquil, and comfortable beauty. Some say that reading his works is like reciting a lyric poem or humming an enchanting serenade, which is not without reason. Mo Ce's works spread a poetic and melodious voice, embodying the artist's deep feelings for the mother river.

Mo Ce has a unique pursuit of his woodcut prints. Especially the misty water and mountain scenery of Jiangnan, which have been like a dream lingering in his heart, constantly stirring his heart. To express that intoxicating poetry, the author boldly adopted the horizontal line composition method in woodcut techniques, creating works such as "Pinglin Moluo," "Shujiang Shui Bi Shushan Qing," and "Qingshan Yin Yin Shui Tiao Tiao," making the works depicting rivers full of poetic atmosphere and musical rhythm.

The rivers of the motherland are colorful, vast, and deep, with a broad mind. I wish Mo Ce will, in his future creations, offer people more beautiful and moving "songs of water."

　　爱水至深　画水至诚
    ——版画家莫测印象
    王经国
    莫测的名字是和水连在一起的。
    诗人艾青誉他为“水的歌手”，同行则称他作“水之赤子”。一位日本美术评论家说得更明确：“莫测通过水表现中国人民的感情，特点是水、水、还是水！”莫测对水的感情可谓深矣！他将自己大半生的创作生涯概括为一句话：跟随水的足迹。
    坦诚的讲，水是生命之源，也是莫测的艺术创作之源。没有水，便没有莫测的版画；没有水，便没有莫测的艺术生命。
    莫测是在苏北水乡长大的。淮河水哺育了他的生命，也涵养了他那温和宽厚的性格。当他喜爱上木刻，以至于学会用版画语言抒发自己的感情时，发表在１９５５年《人民日报》上那幅套色木刻《拿鱼》，就是他奉献给母亲河的第一幅赤诚之作。
    如果说莫测的早期创作还较多地反映了水乡农民获得土地后的喜悦和作者对家乡水暖山温秀丽景色的眷恋之情，那么随着莫测参加水利电力部门的工作，以一个建设者的热忱投入到治理江河事业中去的时候，对水，这个给世界带来生命之源的物质，产生了全新的认识。他感受到祖国江河那深厚宽广的无私奉献精神，也体验到中国人民气壮山河改造自然的伟力。他的心灵被震撼了，他的灵感被触发了。他将对水的一片痴情通过自己那勤奋的刻刀一幅又一幅地表现在版面创作上，流水经年，锲而不舍……
    跟随水的足迹的莫测，似乎比别人更容易发现、领略和捕捉其中的美。那美是具有双重性格的：既有库中桃花潭水深千尺的宁静之美，又有大坝泄水时的激越雄壮之美；既有江河秀丽的自然美，又有巍巍大坝的人工美。莫测用一个水利工作者兼画家的眼光去扫描它们，因而他的感受是独特而深刻的。在他刻刀下反映的景物，感情是真挚的。
    跟随水的足迹，３０多年来，莫测创作了数百幅反映水利建设的作品。这些作品充满了强烈的时代气息，又蕴含着很强的审美价值，不仅记录了大禹传人改造山河的壮举，也体现了作者对生活的理解和对美的追求。他把对水的炽热情感凝聚在他的版画上时，却体现着一种温和、宁静、恬适之美。有人说读他的作品犹如在吟一首抒情小诗，在哼一首迷人的小夜曲，并不是没有道理的。莫测的作品传播着一种如诗如歌的心声，体现了画家对江河母亲的深沉感情。
    莫测对自己的木刻版画有着独特的追求。特别是江南那烟雨迷蒙的水色山光，曾像梦一样地萦绕在他的心中，时时撩拨着他的心扉。为了表现那醉人的诗意，作者在木刻技法上大胆采用了横线组合方式，创作了《平林漠漠》、《蜀江水碧蜀山青》、《青山隐隐水迢迢》等作品，使表现江河的作品充满了诗的意境和音乐的韵律。
    祖国的江河五彩缤纷，浩淼深广，具有博大的胸怀。祝愿莫测在今后的创作中，为人们奉献出更美好动人的“水之歌”。
