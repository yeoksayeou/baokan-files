The 42nd Cannes International Film Festival closed yesterday. The American film "Sex, Lies, and Videotape" unexpectedly won the festival's top prize, the "Palme d'Or," with a 26-year-old director, Steven Soderbergh. The film's male lead, James Spader, also won the best actor award. The film humorously depicts the lives of several young Americans. The female lead in the Australian film "A Cry in the Night," Meryl Streep, won the best actress award. The best director award went to Emir Kusturica for the Yugoslav film "Time of the Gypsies." Famous actor Gregory Peck received a special award.

French films performed modestly at this year's festival. The French Ministry of Culture proposed a plan to revitalize the film industry, allocating over 200 million francs in 1989 to support film production and distribution, and earmarking 50 million francs to help cinemas out of their difficulties. The French Minister of Culture stated that France cannot allow its film industry to continue to decline.

　　第４２届戛纳电影节闭幕
    本报巴黎５月２４日电  记者吕网大报道：在昨天闭幕的第４２届戛纳国际电影节上，美国影片《性、谎言、录像带》意外地获得本届电影节大奖“金棕榈奖”，导演是年仅２６岁的斯第芬·舒得培根；该影片中的男主角詹姆士·斯比得也夺得男演员奖，影片以幽默的笔调描写了几个美国青年的生活情况。澳大利亚影片《黑夜里的呼喊》中的女主角梅里·斯特里普摘取了最佳女演员的桂冠；最佳导演奖授予南斯拉夫《茨冈人的时代》的导演埃米尔·库茨特里加；著名演员格里高里·派克获得特别奖。
    法国电影在这届电影节中成绩平平。法国文化部今年提出一项重振电影事业计划，１９８９年拨款２亿多法郎以支持电影的生产和发行，同时拿出５０００万法郎帮助电影院摆脱困境。法国文化部长表示，不能听任法国电影继续衰弱下去。
