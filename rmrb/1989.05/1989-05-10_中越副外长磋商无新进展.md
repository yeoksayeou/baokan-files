The Chinese and Vietnamese deputy foreign ministers held consultations, but no new progress was made.

The People's Daily, Beijing, May 10th — Today, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with the Vietnamese First Deputy Foreign Minister Ding Ruolian, who came to Beijing to participate in the second round of consultations between the Chinese and Vietnamese deputy foreign ministers. Qian said that over the past few days, the deputy foreign ministers of the two countries have held multiple consultations. We had hoped to achieve some results in the fair and reasonable resolution of the Cambodian issue, but unfortunately, this round of consultations did not yield new progress or any understanding.

He said that we hope that the future Cambodia will be an independent, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned country, maintaining friendly relations with other countries, including China and Vietnam. We do not want to see Cambodia fall into civil war after the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops. Vietnam bears the responsibility for the consequences of its invasion of Cambodia with hundreds of thousands of troops, resulting in more than a decade of war.

Regarding the issue of Sino-Vietnamese relations, Minister Qian expressed that normalizing Sino-Vietnamese relations is our wish, but this can only be achieved after the resolution of the Cambodian issue, not before it.

Ding Ruolian stated that although this round of consultations did not produce results, it increased mutual understanding, and he hopes that the two sides will continue to consult.

Minister Qian pointed out that Vietnam should show sincerity in resolving the Cambodian issue and take practical actions. Only in this way can conditions be created for further consultations between the two sides.

　　中越副外长磋商无新进展
    本报北京５月１０日讯  外交部部长钱其琛今天会见了来京参加中越副外长第二次磋商的越南第一副外长丁儒廉。他说，几天来中越两国副外长进行了多次磋商，本来我们希望在公正合理地解决柬埔寨问题上能取得一些成果，但遗憾的是这次磋商并没有取得新的进展，没有达成什么谅解。
    他说，我们希望未来的柬埔寨成为一个独立、和平、中立、不结盟的国家，同其他国家包括中国和越南在内，都保持友好关系。我们不愿看到越南撤军以后，柬埔寨发生内战。越南几十万军队入侵柬埔寨进行长达十多年战争所造成的后果，越南有责任加以消除。
    在谈到中越关系问题时，钱外长表示，实现中越关系正常化是我们的愿望，但这只能在柬埔寨问题解决之后，而不是在这之前。
    丁儒廉表示，这次磋商虽然没有结果，但增加了相互了解，希望中越双方继续磋商。
    钱外长指出，越南应该对柬埔寨问题的解决表现出诚意，做些实际的事情，只有这样，才能为双方进一步的磋商创造条件。
