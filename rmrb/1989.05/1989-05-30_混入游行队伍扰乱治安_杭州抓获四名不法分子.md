    混入游行队伍扰乱治安
    杭州抓获四名不法分子
    新华社杭州5月30日电  杭州市公安机关日前依法收审了四名混入学生游行队伍扰乱社会治安、进行流氓活动的不法分子。
    据查，这四人中，一人是无业青年，一人是某区办企业农村户口合同工，两人是企业工人。其中三人曾因流氓斗殴、偷窃、赌博等受过处理。
    自5月19日以来，这4名不法分子经常伙同社会上的一些闲散人员，打着“杭州市民自发声援团”等横幅，白天黑夜在街头四处游逛，还在大街上拦截汽车，敲打车门，强行要司机长鸣喇叭向他们“致意”。仅在23日晚，市区主要街道上遭到他们拦阻的汽车就有上百辆，严重扰乱了治安、交通秩序。24日深夜，他们在闹市区一边狂呼“为了健牌（香烟）”，一边冲向路边殴打摊贩。
    25日晚，这伙人又在武林广场围攻、殴打一名指责他们行为的工人，殴打了两名维持秩序的交通民警。
