One Hand Takes Bribes, One Hand Frees a Death Row Inmate
Three Prison Officials in Hunan Arrested

	Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 11th—Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: Three prison officials from the Hunan Province's Seventh Labor Reform Team's Fifth Work Unit have been arrested for taking bribes and releasing a death row inmate. The officials involved are the head of the strict management team, Luo Guiyuan, and the team member, Liao Shoubao. The deputy head of the strict management team, Cai Qikang, has also been imprisoned.

	According to a report from the Hunan Provincial Higher People's Court, the 26-year-old criminal Chen Wenxiong has been sentenced multiple times since 1981 for crimes including forging seals, impersonation, and theft. In August 1988, he was sentenced to death by the Hengyang Intermediate People's Court for theft and was imprisoned in the strict management team of the Fifth Work Unit of the Seventh Labor Reform Team in Hunan Province.

	After learning that Chen had been sentenced to death, Luo Guiyuan, the head of the strict management team, repeatedly contacted Chen and his family, proposing to release Chen for a bribe of 200,000 yuan. The final agreed amount was 140,000 yuan. In March of this year, Liao Shoubao, a team member, went to Chen's family in Xintian County, bringing two letters for Chen and stating that money could save Chen. Chen's younger brother, Chen Wenbin, gave Liao 100 yuan. On March 29th, Liao went to Chen's family again, and Chen's mother gave Liao 10,000 yuan, of which Liao kept 2,000 yuan and gave the remaining 8,000 yuan to Chen's wife, Long Mei. On April 10th in the evening, Luo demanded 1,000 yuan in cash from Chen Wenbin; on the 12th, he demanded another 3,670 yuan. After receiving the money, Luo agreed to release Chen and conspired with Chen's family to plan the escape.

	At around 1:30 AM on April 14th, Luo lied to the guards, saying that the "provincial court wanted to interrogate Chen," and took Chen out of the cell after Cai Qikang, the deputy head of the strict management team, had removed Chen's handcuffs. Luo then changed Chen into a police uniform and escorted him out of the labor reform team. Chen's wife, Long Mei, and her sister-in-law, Liu Qiuyuan, were waiting outside to receive him. Liu drove Chen to the Leiyang train station on a motorcycle, where Chen boarded a train and escaped. Chen has since been captured in Chengdu.

　　一手索巨贿　一手放死囚   
    湖南三劳改干部被捕
    本报长沙５月１１日电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省第七劳改队五工区严管队队长罗桂元、干部廖寿保索贿放走一名死刑犯，最近被依法逮捕。参与这一犯罪活动的严管队副队长蔡其康也锒铛入狱。
    据湖南省高级人民法院报告称，现年２６岁的罪犯陈文雄，自１９８１年以来，先后因伪造印章罪、招摇撞骗罪、盗窃罪等被判刑，１９８８年８月因盗窃罪再次入狱后，被衡阳市中级人民法院依法判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身，关押在湖南省第七劳改队五工区严管队。
    严管队长罗桂元得知陈犯被判处死刑后，多次与陈犯及家属接触，提出要以２０万元为条件，放走陈犯，最后以１４万元成交。严管队干部廖寿保也于今年３月找到新田县陈家，替陈犯带去两封信，并说只要有钱就能救出陈犯。陈犯之弟陈文斌给了廖１００元。今年３月２９日，廖寿保又去陈犯家，陈母交廖带回１００００元，廖自己留２０００元，另外８０００元交给陈妻龙玫。今年４月１０日晚，罗桂元从陈文斌手中索要了１０００元现金；１２日，又索要了３６７０元，罗收款后即表态可以放人，并与陈犯的家属密谋了劫狱的具体步骤。
    ４月１４日凌晨１点多钟，罗桂元谎称“省法院要提审陈犯”，将早已被严管队副队长蔡其康卸去手铐的陈犯带出监舍，并给其换上警服，送出劳改队。早已在劳改队外接应的陈妻龙玫及表姐夫刘秋元迎上来。刘秋元驾摩托车送陈犯到耒阳火车站，乘火车逃走。陈犯已在成都被抓获。
