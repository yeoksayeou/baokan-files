Denmark, excluding the Jutland Peninsula, is composed of numerous large and small islands scattered across the Baltic Sea and the Kattegat. The country is rich in lakes and rivers, making it home to a variety of water birds. Whether it's vast lakes or small streams, quiet countryside or bustling cities, wherever there is water, you can find flocks of swans and wild ducks. In the capital city of Copenhagen, there is a five-section lake surrounded by streets and buildings, with constant traffic and noise. However, this is where swans, wild ducks, and other water birds reside, swimming and playing on the clear lake surface, adding a serene rural charm to the bustling city.

In Denmark, no one keeps birds as pets. Birds follow the natural laws of ecology to reproduce and grow. Yet, no matter where you go, you can enjoy the various pleasures that birds bring. You lie down on the grass, like a green carpet, and birds will appear around you, flying among the trees, jumping on the grass, so close that you can almost touch them with your hand. Under the temptation of the bright spring sunshine, they can't help but sing for you, with different tunes, sometimes solo, sometimes in chorus.

Birds bring joy to people, and this is primarily because people give them endless love. Once, during a picnic in the countryside, a group of water birds was seen foraging in a small lake nearby. When a small car approached the lake, the water birds flew over in a swarm. Inside the car was an elderly woman with silver hair. She did not get out of the car but simply opened the window. The water birds fearlessly flew into the car, and the old woman fed them one by one. After a while, perhaps having eaten their fill, the water birds spread their wings and flew out of the car, returning to the lake.

Feeding birds has become a custom in Denmark. Whether in summer or winter, in squares and parks where birds gather, you can see people feeding birds every day, especially the elderly and children. They seem to think that without their feeding, the birds cannot survive. In a small tree near a park close to my residence, I once saw a small feeding tray hanging, filled with bread crumbs, specifically prepared for the timid sparrows. This small feeding tray fully shows the sincere love of the Danish people for birds.

Now, the national bird of Denmark is the white swan, but it used to be the Danish crane. The Danes regard this bird as a divine bird, saying that infants are brought to the world by them. From an unknown time and for unknown reasons, the number of Danish cranes suddenly decreased. Now, on the Jutland Peninsula, there is a small city where the Danish crane is the only place they can enter and exit. Every spring, when the flowers bloom, the residents of the city will build wooden frames on the roofs of their houses to make it convenient for the divine birds to build nests and lay eggs. When the divine birds return, people from all over the country come to welcome them, along with the local residents, just like welcoming a victorious hero.

　　鸟儿款款飞
    士平
    丹麦，除日德兰半岛外都是大大小小的岛屿，宛如一颗颗翡翠散落在波罗的海和卡特加特海中，境内多湖泊河流，因而水鸟很多。在这里，不论是浩淼的湖泊还是涓涓小溪，也不论是在静谧的乡间还是在喧闹的城市，只要有水的地方都能见到成群的天鹅和野鸭。在首都哥本哈根市区有个五段湖，四周被街道和建筑团团围住，整天车水马龙，嘈杂声不绝于耳。然而，那里却是天鹅、野鸭和其它水鸟的栖身之处，在清澈的湖面上畅游嬉戏，悠然之神态给繁华的都市奇特地添上了宁静的乡村韵味。
    在丹麦，没有人养鸟。鸟儿只是循着生态规律繁衍生长。但无论走到哪里，人们都可以欣赏到鸟的种种乐趣。你躺在绿色毛毯般的草地上，鸟儿便会出现在你的周围，在树间飞绕，在草地上跳跃，离得那么近，你伸出手去，便可落在手中。在明媚春光的诱惑下，它们也按捺不住要向你献歌，用各种不同的音调，时而独唱，时而合唱。
    鸟儿给人们以欢乐，而首先是因为人们给它们以不尽的爱。一次，去郊外野餐。不远处，有一群水鸟在一潭湖水中觅食。当一辆小车驶近湖边时，水鸟争先恐后飞去团团围了。车里是位银发老人。她并不下车，只将车窗打开。水鸟竟然毫不胆怯地飞入车内，老人便一一喂了食。一会，大概是饱食了，水鸟又展开双翅，飞出车外，回到湖上。
    喂鸟在丹麦形成了风尚。无论是夏日还是寒冬，在鸟儿集中的广场、公园，每天都能见到喂鸟的人，尤以老人和儿童为多。他们似乎觉得缺了他们的喂养，鸟儿便无法生存下去。在住所附近公园里的一棵小树上，我曾看见挂着一只小食盘，里面放着面包屑，那是专为天性胆小的雀类预备的。从这小小食盘足见丹麦人一片真诚的爱鸟之心了。
    现在丹麦的国鸟是白天鹅，过去却是丹麦鹤。丹麦人视此鸟为仙鸟，说婴儿便是由它们衔到人间的。不知从何时起，也不知何故，丹麦鹤的数量骤然减少了。现在，日德兰半岛有个小城市，是丹麦鹤唯一出入的地方。每年春暖花开时节，城里居民都要在自家的房顶上修搭木架，以方便仙鸟筑巢孵蛋。当仙鸟归来时，全国各地有不少人专程赶去，和当地居民一起，像对凯旋的勇士一样加以欢迎。
