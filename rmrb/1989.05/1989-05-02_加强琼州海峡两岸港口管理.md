The exchange of goods between the mainland and Hainan is expanding, and the ports of Hai'an on the mainland and Haikou New Port in Hainan are becoming increasingly busy.

Recently, I observed the following: As night falls, groups of fishing boats, disregarding the avoidance signals from large ships, force their way past ships that are about to dock, creating dangerous situations. Many vessels do not comply with standard lighting and sound signals, and some even lack any lighting or signaling equipment. The anchorage of various ships in Hai'an Port is dense and disorderly, reducing the main channel, which is only 60 meters wide, to just over 30 meters, causing difficulties in ship navigation. The situation worsens during low tide, sometimes even blocking the channel and preventing outgoing ships from departing.

To ensure waterway traffic safety, I suggest that Guangdong and Hainan provinces promptly coordinate and formulate practical management measures. The ship inspection department should strictly control ship inspections, and the maritime administration should strengthen on-site supervision, eliminate illegal and non-compliant operating ships, and promptly delineate the boundaries of Hai'an Port and the anchorage area to ensure the safety of the port and ship navigation.

### 加强琼州海峡两岸港口管理

　　加强琼州海峡两岸港口管理
    大陆与海南之间的商品交流不断扩大，琼州海峡两岸的海安港和海口新港日益繁忙。
    我最近在这里看到：在夜暮降临之际，成群结队的渔船不顾大船发出的避让信号，强行从即将停靠码头的大船前驶过，以致险象环生。不少船舶灯号、声号不符合规范，有的甚至无灯光信号装置。海安港各式船舶锚泊密度大又杂乱无章，使本来只有６０米宽的主航道只剩下３０多米宽，造成船舶通行困难。退潮时情况更糟，有时甚至堵塞航道，使出港船舶无法开航。
    为确保水上交通安全，建议广东、海南两省尽快协商制定切实可行的管理办法。船检部门把好验船关，航政部门要加强现场监督，取缔非法、违章营运船舶，并尽快划定海安港与锚地范围，保证港口和船舶航行安全。
