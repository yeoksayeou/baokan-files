Upon reading the investigative report titled "This Type of Street Vendor Must Be Strictly Rectified to Prevent Them from Tarnishing the Capital," I was reminded of the letter to the editor and accompanying photographs published in your newspaper on June 4, 1988, titled "A Warning to Customers: Beware of Deceptive Sales Tactics, and a Warning to Vendors: Do Not Engage in Fraudulent Activities." It truly makes one indignant.

A year has passed, but incidents of these vendors "fleecing" customers have not only not decreased but have become increasingly rampant. It is truly bewildering. Is there really no way to deal with these vendors?!

For these unscrupulous vendors, heavy penalties must be imposed. They must be fined to the point of bankruptcy and deterred to the point of fear. Only then will they behave themselves, conduct business honestly, and live honestly. I hope that the relevant departments will take effective measures. Simply replacing the market management director is not enough, and merely admitting mistakes verbally is also not enough.

### 对于不法商贩要课以重罚

专栏：

　　对于不法商贩要课以重罚
    读了《这类摊商应严加整顿，不许他们给首都抹黑》的信访调查，联想起去年６月４日你报第五版刊登的《敬告顾客：提防骗买伎俩，正告商贩：莫干坑人勾当》的读者来信和照片，真是让人气愤难忍。
    一年的时间过去了，这类“宰”顾客的事情不但没有减少，而且愈演愈烈，真让人不可思议。难道对于这些商贩真没有办法处理了吗？！
    对于一些不法商贩，一定要课以重罚，要罚得他们破产、丧胆。这样，才能使他们安份守己，诚实地做生意，诚实地做人。我希望有关部门采取有效措施，仅靠撤换市场管理主任是不行的，仅在嘴上承认失误也是不行的。
