Thai Prime Minister Meets with Japanese Prime Minister to Discuss Economic and Trade Issues and the Cambodian Situation

BANGKOK, May 1 (Xinhua) — Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan held talks with Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru this afternoon, focusing on economic and trade relations between the two countries and the situation in Cambodia.

On economic and trade issues, the Thai side presented three requests to the Japanese side. First, Thailand hopes that Japan will ease import quotas and reduce import taxes on Thai products exported to Japan, thereby increasing Thailand's exports to Japan and narrowing the trade deficit between the two countries. Second, Thailand hopes for more technology transfers from Japan. Third, Thailand requests Japan's assistance in training technical personnel in fields such as petrochemicals.

The Japanese side expressed serious consideration of Thailand's aforementioned requests and will conduct further research upon return.

During the talks, the Japanese side agreed to help Thailand build an overpass in Bangkok.

On the Cambodian issue, the Thai side briefed the Japanese side on the current progress in politically resolving the Cambodian situation. The Japanese side expressed support for Thailand and ASEAN countries' stance on the Cambodian issue and their efforts to seek a peaceful resolution.

Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru arrived in Bangkok on April 29 to begin his visit to Thailand.
