The Ministry of Construction recently issued a notice, calling for stricter management of China's construction workforce, which faces the dual challenges of reduced construction scale and rectification.

The notice states that efforts must continue to strictly control the size of the construction workforce, aiming to reduce the number of employees by the end of this year compared to the previous year. At the same time, it is necessary to rationally reduce the number of subcontracted workers, temporary workers, contract farm workers employed by state-owned construction enterprises, and rural construction teams independently undertaking projects in cities and mining areas. These workers should be guided back to rural areas to participate in agricultural water conservancy construction and agricultural production.

As a key measure to strengthen workforce management, the notice requires a comprehensive review of construction enterprise qualifications this year. Starting from 1990, all construction enterprises nationwide will use new qualification certificates. Based on the qualification conditions, the scope of movement for construction enterprises will be defined to reduce blind movement. First and second-level construction enterprises can independently undertake cross-provincial projects, while other enterprises will have their movement areas within the province determined by the provincial construction authorities. For rural construction teams independently undertaking ongoing projects, their project scope and duration will be limited through qualification reviews, and they should return to their villages upon project completion. Additionally, through the qualification review, concrete component factories without funds, equipment, and poor quality, as well as intermediary companies without contracting capabilities, will be shut down.

　　建设部严控建筑队伍规模　   
    年内全面开展施工企业资质复查
    新华社北京４月３０日电  建设部日前发出通知，要求对面临基建规模压缩和治理整顿双重考验的我国建筑业施工队伍进一步加强管理。
    通知说，要继续严格控制施工队伍规模，力争使今年底的职工人数低于上年。与此同时，要继续合理清退国有施工企业使用的外包工、临时工、农民合同工以及在城市和工矿区独立承揽工程的农村建筑队积极疏导，让他们重返农村参加农田水利建设和农业生产。
    作为强化队伍管理的重要手段，通知要求今年内全面开展施工企业资质复查。从１９９０年起，全国施工企业将使用新的资质证书。根据资质条件划分施工企业流动范围，减少盲目流动。一二级施工企业可跨省独立承包工程，其余企业由各省建设主管部门确定其在省内的流动区域。对于独立承包在建工程的农村建筑队，通过资质审查，限定其承揽工程的范围、期限，工程完成后应立即返乡。同时，通过资质复查，取缔无资金、无设备、质量低劣的混凝土构件厂，取缔无承包能力的转手公司。
