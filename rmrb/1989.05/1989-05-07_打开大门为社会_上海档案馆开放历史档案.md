The once mysterious archives are now open to the common people. Since the end of 1987, the Shanghai Archives have gradually opened a batch of historical archives, and in 1988, they received over 5,000 visitors.

The Shanghai Archives were established in 1959. Currently, the archives hold 1.07 million volumes (books) of documents, including historical archives of the Communist Party of China's underground activities before liberation, archives from the Japanese puppet regime and the Nationalist government, concession archives, and a portion of archives from enterprises and institutions. Such rich and valuable archival materials were previously kept hidden in the vaults with very low utilization rates. After the implementation of the Archives Law, the Shanghai Archives have opened over 200,000 volumes (books) of historical archives in batches, and more will be opened this year for public viewing.

As the saying goes, "A thousand-year-old document is a good medicine." The opening of historical archives has attracted many visitors. Historians and compilers have collected a large amount of original materials here; those planning to establish industry associations have borrowed and referenced materials from the archives of their respective industries; writers and artists have found inspiration for their creations. Even common people's issues, such as educational background and inheritance, have found proof in the archives.

In recent years, to provide more and better archival materials to society, the Shanghai Archives have developed and utilized their historical archives. Two periodicals, "Archives and History" and "Shanghai Archives," have been published, respectively focusing on academic and popular aspects, timely releasing newly discovered and organized archival materials to society.

　　打开大门为社会    
    上海档案馆开放历史档案
    新华社上海电  （记者严卫民）一向神秘的档案馆，如今向寻常百姓打开了大门。自１９８７年底起，上海档案馆逐步开放了一批历史档案，１９８８年就接待了５０００多查阅者。
    上海档案馆建立于１９５９年，目前馆藏档案资料１０７万卷（册），内容包括解放前中共地下党的历史档案、日伪时期和国民党市政府的档案、租界档案和一部分企事业单位的档案等。如此丰富而珍贵的档案资料，过去长期深藏库中，利用率很低。《档案法》实施后，上海档案馆分批开放了２０多万卷（册）历史档案，今年还将开放一批，供人们查阅。
    俗话说，千年文书好合药。历史档案的开放，引来了众多的查阅者。编史修志者，在这里收罗了大量的原始资料；筹建行业协会的人，从同业公会的档案中借鉴参考；作家、艺术家们从中发现了创作素材。就连百姓的学历和继承等难题，也在档案里找到了证明。
    为了给社会提供更多更好的档案资料，近年来上海档案馆对馆藏历史档案进行开发利用。《档案与历史》、《上海档案》两种期刊，分别从学术性和普及性出发，及时向社会发表新近整理发掘出的档案资料。
