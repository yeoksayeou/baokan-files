Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 29th.

The "National Struggle Decade" initiated by the "National Democratic Movement United Front" and the "National University Student Representatives Council" of South Korea to oppose the Roh Tae-woo regime ended on the 27th.

This movement was held to commemorate the 9th anniversary of the Gwangju Massacre on May 18, 1980, where citizens protested against Chun Doo-hwan's rule. The goal was to demand that the South Korean authorities deal with the key figures involved in corruption cases during Chun Doo-hwan's presidency and to fully exonerate those involved in the Gwangju incident.

On the 27th, 30,000 people from various sectors in Gwangju participated in the closing ceremony. The ceremony unanimously expressed the determination to continue the struggle for democratization, the right to live, and national unification. After the ceremony, a demonstration march was held.

From May 18th to 27th, over 400,000 people from various sectors in South Korea participated in the "National Struggle Decade" activities.
