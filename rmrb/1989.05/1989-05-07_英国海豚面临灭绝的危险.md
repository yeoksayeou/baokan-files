Xinhua News Agency, London, May 5th.

	British dolphins are facing the threat of extinction. The international environmental protection organization "Greenpeace" released a report yesterday stating that if urgent protective measures are not taken, dolphins in British coastal waters will soon face extinction.

	There were 69 coastal areas with dolphin populations 50 years ago, which reduced to 8 in the early 1980s, and now only 2 remain. There are only 8 adult dolphins in Cardigan Bay, Wales, and approximately 30 in Moray Firth, Scotland.

	In a letter to the Welsh Secretary Peter Walker, "Greenpeace" stated that the reasons for the impending extinction of dolphins are: overfishing has led to a lack of food for dolphins, and severe water pollution has caused a large number of dolphin deaths.

　　英国海豚面临灭绝的危险
    新华社伦敦五月五日电  （记者王国瑞）世界环境保护组织“绿色和平”昨天发表一份报告说，如果不采取紧急保护措施，英国沿岸海域中的海豚行将灭绝。
    有海豚群落的沿海海域，五十年前有六十九个，八十年代初减到八个，现在还剩两个。成年海豚，在威尔士的卡迪根湾只有八条，在苏格兰的马里湾约有三十条。
    “绿色和平”给威尔士大臣彼得·沃克的一封信中说，使海豚行将灭绝的原因是：对渔业资源过度捕捞，使海豚没有东西吃；海水严重污染，造成海豚大量死亡。
