	More than 30,000 South Korean workers, farmers, and students held a rally in Gwangju on May 21 to commemorate the 9th anniversary of the Gwangju People's Uprising and demanded the resignation of the Roh Tae-woo regime.

	The crowds came from Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Incheon, and other cities. This was part of a 10-day protest planned to commemorate the Gwangju Uprising. On May 20, 30,000 citizens and students also held a rally in Gwangju.

	The protesters accused the United States of being the mastermind behind the Gwangju incident and demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea.

		HANCITY, May 23 (Xinhua) — According to a broadcast by Seoul Radio, South Korean crowds and students in Gwangju continued to hold rallies and protests on May 22, facing police suppression.

	Since May 17, workers, farmers, and students from various cities and rural areas in South Korea have gathered in Gwangju to commemorate the 9th anniversary of the Gwangju People's Uprising, which was brutally suppressed by former President Chun Doo-hwan.

	On May 22, a planned rally in Gwangju was unable to proceed as scheduled due to police blockades. Over 2,000 students and citizens who were supposed to attend the rally took to the streets, clashing with police in front of the U.S. cultural center in Gwangju. More than 200 protesters and police were injured, and some protesters were arrested.

	On the same day, the "National University Student Representatives Council" of South Korea decided to designate May 22 to 27 as the "Anti-American Struggle Week," planning various anti-American activities during this period.
