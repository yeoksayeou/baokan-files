Feng Mu recently celebrated his 70th birthday in the hospital. Friends of different age groups planned to visit him after his discharge as a personal celebration among literary friends. I was out of town on a business trip and couldn't make it to the gathering. After returning to Beijing, I received his book “Literary Decade of Storms and Rain,” a newly published collection of essays by the Writers Publishing House, which can be considered a gift from the publisher.

The title of this book is “Literary Decade of Storms and Rain,” but as far as I know, it is not a complete collection of his works from the past ten years. In the previous few years, he had published several collections of essays such as “Cultivation of Literature,” “Rapid Current Small Collection,” “Mainstream of Literature in the New Era,” and “Selected Literary Criticism by Feng Mu.” This book, “Storms and Rain,” is a collection of some of his essays from the past ten years that were not included in the aforementioned collections, and it is not entirely composed of his most outstanding and representative works. Even so, I believe that this collection still reflects Feng Mu’s trajectory in literary criticism and his thoughts on some issues.

Among the senior figures in the field of literary criticism, Feng Mu is a pioneer who dared to stand up and work diligently to rectify past mistakes and promote the development of literature in the new era. He is someone I respect. Over the past ten years, due to my work, I have had the opportunity to meet him frequently, listen to his speeches, talks, and reports. Each time I heard his speeches on literary topics, I was moved by his firm beliefs, sincere emotions, and his vision of nurturing younger generations. Many of his speeches are reflected in the articles of this book. “The Broad Road of Literature in the New Era,” “Literature Should Focus on and Embrace Life,” “Expectations and Prospects for Current Literary Creation,” “The Social Responsibility of Writers and the Social Benefits of Works,” and “The Value of Literature Lies in Elevating Human Thought” all embody his critical views, style, and characteristics. After these articles were published, I read most of them, and today, re-reading them, I still have the same impression.

Generally, those who engage in theoretical work, especially those in leadership positions, often neglect reading works. However, Feng Mu is different. From listening to his speeches, talks, or conversations, I know that he has read many new works. He not only reads the representative works of famous writers but also reads the practice pieces of many lesser-known new authors, and even reads some manuscripts sent to him by those who are just starting to write. I have a piece of evidence for this. In the summer of 1985, we took a train from Hohhot to the Hulunbuir Grassland, and I stayed with him in a sleeper car for over 60 hours. Besides talking and sleeping, he also found time to read two novels. This incident shows how he usually seizes time to read works. Because this is a fundamental skill or capital for a critic. This aspect is worth learning from.

From this book “Storms and Rain” and his other collections of essays, it can be seen that Feng Mu is very willing to nurture young authors. He has commented on the works of many writers who are already well-known. New writers who emerged in the new era, such as Deng Gang, Li Cunbao, Shi Tiesheng, Liu Yuzhou, and Zhang Chengzhi, he has given enthusiastic comments and support to their works as soon as they were published. For some new writers, while praising their works, he sometimes has some reservations, but he remains enthusiastic and passionate. This is commendable.

Due to the development of literature itself and the constant updating of literary concepts, there are some differences in knowledge structure and literary concepts among writers and critics of different eras and age groups. This is very natural. Some new critics do not agree with some of Feng Mu’s views, and even have some reservations. This is understandable. “The hearts of people are different, just like their faces.” This is even more likely in academic and theoretical views. There is a saying now that in academic debates, it is better to “seek differences and store similarities.” I think this saying makes sense. I highly approve of the “dual-track mechanism” in creation and theory, allowing works of different styles and schools, and theories of different views and opinions to coexist and complement each other. I think the same applies to Feng Mu’s critiques. These are my shallow thoughts after reading “Literary Decade of Storms and Rain.”

　　信念·激情·境界    
    ——读冯牧《文学十年风雨路》札记
    缪俊杰
    冯牧同志最近在医院中度过了他的７０岁生日。几个年龄层次不同的朋友相约，待他出院后一起去看他，作为文友间个人的祝贺。我因出差在外地，未能赶上这次小聚。回京以后却收到了他的《文学十年风雨路》，这是作家出版社新近出版的评论集，大概可以算出版社献给他的礼物了。
    这本书名虽标《文学十年风雨路》，但据我所知，并不是他新近十年的全部作品，因为前几年，他曾经出过《耕耘文集》、《激流小集》、《新时期文学的主流》、《冯牧文学评论选》等几部评论集，这本《风雨路》只是未编入上述集子中的近十年来的另一些文章，而且也不完全是他最精采、最有代表性的作品。即令如此，我觉得，这本集子仍然可以看出冯牧同志文艺评论活动的轨迹和对一些问题的思考。
    在文艺评论界的前辈中，冯牧同志是为拨乱反正、促进新时期文学的发展，敢于挺身而出和勤奋劳作的一位，是我尊敬的一位。因为这十年来，由于工作的关系，常在一起碰面，听他发言、讲话、作报告。每一次听他关于文艺方面的发言，都为他的坚定的信念、真挚的感情，和扶植晚辈的境界所感动。他的许多发言，都体现在这本书的文章中了。《新时期文学的广阔道路》、《文学应当关注和拥抱生活》、《对当前文学创作的期望和展望》、《作家的社会责任与作品的社会效益》以及《文学的价值在于提高人的思想境界》等，都体现了他的评论的观念、风格与特色。在这些文章发表以后，我大都读过，今天重读，仍然有着这样的印象。
    一般搞理论的人，特别是担负一些领导工作的人，往往疏于阅读作品，但冯牧同志则不然。在听他的发言、讲话或交谈中，我了解到他读了许多新的作品。不仅读知名作家的代表作品，也读许多鲜为人知的新作者的习作，甚至读有些初学写作的人送给他的原稿。关于这一点我有一个旁证。１９８５年夏天，我们从呼和浩特乘火车到呼伦贝尔草原，我同他在一个卧房里呆了６０多个小时，除了说话、睡觉，他还抓时间读了两部长篇小说。从这件事可以看出，他平时如何抓紧时间读作品。因为这是一个搞评论的人的“基本功”，或者叫做“本钱”。读作品这一点很值得我们学习。
    从这本《风雨路》和他的其它评论集中的文章看到，冯牧同志是很乐意扶植青年作者的。他评论过大家早已熟知的许多作家的作品。邓刚、李存葆、史铁生、刘亚洲、张承志等新时期涌现的作家，他们的作品一经问世，他都给予热情的评论和支持。对于某些新进作家的作品，在赞扬中有时也有某种保留，但仍不失热情和激情。这是难能可贵的。
    由于文学本身的发展和文学观念的不断更新，不同时代不同年龄层次的作家、评论家之间，在知识结构和文学观念上存在一些差异，这是很自然的。有些新进的评论家对于冯牧同志的某些观点不予认同，甚至有些微词，这是可以理解的。“人心之不同，如其面焉”，在学术理论的看法上更可能如此。现在有种说法，在学术论争上宁可“求异存同”，我觉得，这种说法有道理。我很赞成在创作上和理论上搞“双轨机制”，容许不同风格、流派的作品和不同观念、见解的理论同时存在，互补共进。我想对冯牧同志的论评也是如此。这就是我在读了《文学十年风雨路》的一些粗浅的感想。
