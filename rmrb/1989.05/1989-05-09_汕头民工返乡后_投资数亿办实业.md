Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 9th.

A group of migrant workers from Shantou City, Guangdong Province, who had been working on construction projects in other regions, have returned home after the scale of construction projects was reduced. They are now investing heavily in industrial ventures.

In Dajiao District, construction team leader Lin Ronghua returned home to establish a decorative printing factory. In May of last year, he invested in a plastics enterprise in partnership with others. Inspired by Lin Ronghua, more than 20 people in Dajiao District have returned home to invest over 20 million yuan. They have set up factories for plastics, printing, grain and oil processing, as well as poultry and pig farms. Some have also taken on the development of tidal flats, barren hills, and forests for fruit cultivation, fish, and shrimp farming, engaging in developmental agricultural production. It is reported that since last year, the funds invested by Shantou City's migrant workers who had been working on construction projects in other regions have amounted to billions of yuan. They humorously say, "In the past, we were busy building high-rise buildings in other places, but now it's time to do something for our hometown."

　　汕头民工返乡后    
    投资数亿办实业
    新华社广州５月９日电  （记者李沪、通讯员徐健）广东汕头市一批在外地承包建筑工程的人员，于压缩基建规模后，纷纷回乡投资办实业。
    达濠区在外承包建筑工程的工程队长林荣华回乡创办了装璜印刷厂，去年５月又投资与人合作兴办塑料企业。在林荣华的带动下，达濠区已有２０多人回乡投资达２０００多万元，兴办了塑料、印刷、粮油加工厂和养鸡场、养猪场，或承包滩涂水面、荒山坡地，造林种果，养鱼养虾，搞开发性农业生产。据悉，去年以来，汕头市在外地承包建筑工程的人员，回乡办实业所投放的资金数以亿元计。他们风趣地说，以往我们忙着在外地建高楼大厦，这回应该为家乡办些实事了。
