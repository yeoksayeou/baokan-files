The Pulitzer Prize in the United States is not like a typical professional award. It is a cross-category, multi-item award. It was established using funds from the will of American newspaper magnate Joseph Pulitzer, with the aim of "promoting public welfare, social morality, American literature, and education." Starting in 1917, it has been awarded annually in the spring.

The list of this year's Pulitzer Prize winners and their winning works was announced recently. Neil Sheehan's "A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam" won the Best Non-Fiction Book Award. The author spent 16 years completing this work, which combines the biography of Army Colonel John Paul Vann with history, detailing the entire process of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War.

Sheehan previously served as a correspondent for The New York Times in Vietnam. The secret history of the Vietnam War he revealed for the Department of Defense led to The New York Times winning the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service in 1972. This time, after receiving the award, he told reporters, "I spent 16 years to get this award, and I am extremely excited. People only realize its true meaning when they receive it."

Anne Tyler's "The Accidental Tourist" won the Best Novel Award. This is the author's 11th novel, telling the story of an elderly couple attending the funeral of a friend. After winning the award, the author happily told her publisher, "This is a great honor. I am truly happy and surprised to hear this news."

Richard Wilbur's "Collected Poems," the second Poet Laureate of the United States, won the Best Poetry Award. The collection includes his six previously published poetry collections, along with 23 new poems.

Richard Ellmann's "Oscar Wilde" won the Best Biography Award. Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was a famous Irish writer, poet, and playwright. Ellmann is an American dedicated to British and Irish literature. His "James Joyce and W.B. Yeats" is considered one of the best literary biographies of the century, winning the National Book Award in 1959. He is also one of the most important modern literary critics.

Taylor Branch's "Parting the Waters: America in the King Years 1954-63" and James McPherson's "Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era" both won the Best History Book Award.

Wendy Wasserstein's "The Heidi Chronicles" won the Best Drama Award.

In the news category, there are awards for humanitarian spirit, such as freelance photographer Ron Oshry's photograph taken at a fire scene, showing a firefighter mouth-to-mouth resuscitating a young girl rescued from the flames, which won the News Photography Award. There are awards for dedication to duty, such as Bill Keller of The New York Times in Moscow and Glenn Frankel of The Washington Post in Jerusalem, who both won the International Reporting Award for their coverage of the 1988 Armenian earthquake in the Soviet Union and the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories. There are also awards for accurately reflecting domestic social issues, such as the Anchorage Daily News' vivid reporting on the problems of alcoholism and suicide in Alaska, indicating the despair of the people, which won the Public Service Award.

The amount of the Pulitzer Prize varies by year. This year, each award is $3,000. The Public Service Award receives a gold medal.

　　说说今年的普利策奖
    曹玉如
    美国普利策奖不像一般专业性奖。它是一种跨类别的多项奖。是根据美国报业巨头约瑟夫·普利策遗嘱提供的资金设立的，目的在于“推动公共事业、社会道德、美国文学和教育的进步”。从１９１７年起，每年春天颁奖一次。
    今年的普利策奖获得者名单和获奖作品已在不久前宣布。尼尔·希恩所著《冠冕堂皇的谎言：约翰·保罗·范恩和美国在越南》一书获本届最佳非小说奖。作者花了１６年心血才完成的这部著作，把陆军上校范恩的传记与历史融合在一起，详细记叙了美国卷入越战的全过程。
    希恩曾任《纽约时报》驻越南记者。他披露的美国国防部越南战争秘密史，使《纽约时报》于１９７２年获普利策公共服务奖。这次，他在获奖后对记者说：“我花了１６年时间才获得此奖，感到万分激动。人们只有在得到它时，才会认识到它真正的意义。”
    安妮·泰勒的《令人叹息的教训》获最佳小说奖。这是作者的第１１部小说，讲述了一对白头偕老的夫妻参加一位朋友的葬礼的故事。获奖后，作者对自己的出版商高兴地说：“这是莫大的荣幸，听到这一消息我真是太高兴了，真是又喜又惊。”
    美国第二任桂冠诗人理查德·威尔伯的《诗歌全集》获最佳诗歌奖。收入全集的除了有他过去出的６个诗集，还加进了２３首新诗。
    理查德·埃尔曼所著《王尔德》获最佳传记奖。王尔德（１８５４—１９００）是一位著名爱尔兰作家、诗人和剧作家。埃尔曼是一位献身于英国和爱尔兰文学的美国人，他写的《乔伊斯·叶芝传》被认为是本世纪最优秀的文学传记，１９５９年获全国图书奖。他还是最重要的现代文学评论家。
    泰勒·布兰奇的《分隔的海洋：马丁·路德·京年代（１９５４—１９６３）的美国》和詹姆斯·麦克弗森的《为自由战斗呼唤：内战时代》两书获最佳历史著作奖。
    温迪·沃塞斯坦的《海迪游记》获最佳戏剧奖。
    在新闻类方面：有奖励人道主义精神的，如自由摄影师罗恩·奥尔施旺在火灾现场抓拍的一张照片，画面上是一名救火队员嘴对嘴地抢救一名从大火中救出的小女孩的动人场面，获新闻图片奖。有奖励忠于职守的，如《纽约时报》驻莫斯科记者比尔·凯勒和《华盛顿邮报》驻耶路撒冷记者格伦·弗兰克尔分别因报道去年苏联亚美尼亚大地震和巴勒斯坦被占领土人民起义而获国际新闻报道奖。还有奖励如实反映国内社会问题的，如《安克雷克每日新闻报》生动地报道了阿拉斯加面临的酗酒、自杀，表明人们处于绝望的心情，获公共服务奖。
    普利策奖奖金数额因年而异。今年，每项奖金３０００美元。公共服务奖获一块金质奖牌。
