Central Military Commission Deputy Secretaries Hong Xuezhi and Liu Huaqing, on behalf of the Central Military Commission, visited some of the troops carrying out martial law duties today.

Hong Xuezhi and Liu Huaqing went to various troop stations, inquiring in detail about the troops' living conditions, and even visited platoons and squads to have meals with the soldiers. They praised the troops for their hard work and dedication, firmly executing the martial law tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and undergoing new tempering and tests. They urged all officers and soldiers to deeply understand the importance of carrying out martial law tasks, continue to uphold the fine traditions and style of the People's Liberation Army, unite closely around the Party Central Committee, and make new contributions to maintaining the stability of the capital and stopping the turmoil.

Yesterday, Hong Xuezhi, accompanied by Deputy Chief of the General Staff He Qizong, also visited other troops enforcing martial law on behalf of the Central Military Commission.

National People's Congress Vice Chairman Qian Zhengying and her entourage of four, representing Chairman Li Xiannian and the other vice chairpersons and the leadership of the National People's Congress, visited the People's Liberation Army troops enforcing martial law in some areas of the capital this morning. The troops of a certain unit of the PLA, who had been ordered to rush to Beijing and were delayed for three days and two nights, stood in formation to welcome Qian Zhengying and her entourage after a brief rest. They marched in unison, shouted slogans loudly, and displayed their mighty military prowess. Qian Zhengying, on behalf of Chairman Li Xiannian, the vice chairpersons, and the National People's Congress leadership, expressed respect and condolences to all the officers and soldiers carrying out martial law duties. She said, "You have firmly executed the orders of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, carrying out martial law in some areas of the capital, and your exemplary actions have shown the true colors of the people's army. You are indeed the children of the people! We believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, you will surely complete the martial law tasks in some areas of the capital."

Qian Zhengying and her entourage also visited the PLA 304 Hospital to see the wounded soldiers who were injured while carrying out martial law duties.

The troops enforcing martial law expressed their determination to remain steadfast in their unity with the Party Central Committee and to complete the martial law tasks victoriously.
