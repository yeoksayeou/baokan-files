	China's first "Automatic Vehicle License Plate Recognition System" and "Vehicle License Plate Database Management System" have been successfully developed by a research team led by Deputy Director Zheng Nannin of the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute at Xi'an Jiaotong University, in collaboration with Zhongzhou Economic and Technological Development Company.

	The "Automatic Vehicle License Plate Recognition System" is a specialized computer vision system that can quickly record and archive the license plates of vehicles traveling at high speeds on the road. It can accurately identify the license plate number and other information of any vehicle within 3 seconds. It can automatically alert for vehicles that have not paid road maintenance fees and those that are wanted by the public security authorities.

　　汽车跑得再快  难逃这双“眼睛”
    本报讯  我国第一个“行驶车辆牌照自动识别系统”和“车辆牌照数据库管理系统”，日前由西安交大人工智能研究所副所长郑南宁副教授带领的课题组和中州经济技术开发公司联合研制成功。
    “行驶车辆牌照自动识别系统”是一种专用的计算机视觉系统，能对公路上疾驰而过的机动车辆牌照及识别结果迅速记录存档。可在３秒钟之内，对任何一辆机动车牌号及其它信息做出准确判断，对未交养路费和公安部门通缉车辆能自动报警。
