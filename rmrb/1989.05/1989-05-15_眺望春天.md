Gazing at Spring

Standing on the edge of winter,
Gazing at spring,
I feel that spring is very close to me.
It seems within reach, with its fragrant breath
Permeating me and making me believe without doubt
That life, vast and hazy, will be magnificent in the next moment.

In reality, spring is very far from me,
To the extent that I cannot describe
The distance from there to here.
It appears in the shape of a thousand years ago,
Chased by flocks of sheep
On the horizon of the vast plain,
Summoned by the heavy sunlight
On the other side of the horizon.
But these are only my guesses.

From the direction of spring,
I cannot discern
Any signs that spring is about to arrive.
The desolate fields are silent and still.
The distant, bluish-green hills
Seem to be pierced by the cold.
Yet, I gaze at spring,
On the frozen ground,
Staring at the place where the sky and earth are fused,
As a symbol of warmth,
Spring begins to spread in my imagination,
Indescribably wonderful yet painfully enduring.

　　眺望春天
    易殿选
    站在冬天的边缘
    眺望春天
    我觉得春天距我很近
    伸手可触，芳芳的气息
    浸润着我并且令我深信不疑
    苍茫的生命在下一刻瑰丽
    事实上春天离我很远
    以至我无法说出
    从那里到这里的距离
    它以一千年前的模样
    在大平原的尽处
    被羊群追赶着
    在地平线一侧
    被沉重的阳光召唤着
    而这些只能是我的猜测
    从春天的方向
    我看不出
    春天将要到来的痕迹
    萧索的原野一片岑寂
    远方铁青色的山岗
    仿佛正在被严寒贯穿
    然而我眺望春天
    于冻土之上
    向天与地胶着的地方凝视
    作为温暖的象征
    春天开始在我的想象里蔓延
    妙不可言又痛苦难耐
