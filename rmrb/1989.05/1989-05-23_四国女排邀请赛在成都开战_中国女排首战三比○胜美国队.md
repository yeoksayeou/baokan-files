The four-nation women's volleyball invitational tournament began in Chengdu tonight. In the first match, the Chinese team defeated the U.S. team with a score of 3-0.

The scores for the three sets were 15-10, 15-4, and 15-6.

Both the Chinese and U.S. teams are newly formed since the Seoul Olympics and this was their first match since the Olympics. The Chinese team's starting lineup today included No. 1 Lai Yawen, No. 2 Li Guojun, No. 4 Zhou Hong, No. 6 He Yunshu, No. 7 Su Huijuan, and No. 8 Li Yunwu. The star player, Sichuan native Wu Dan, did not play in front of her hometown fans. Li Yueling did not come to Chengdu for this tournament due to illness. It is clear that the Chinese team did not field their strongest lineup.

During the match, a banner reading "Revive the Spirit" was displayed in the stands, expressing the audience's expectations for the Chinese women's volleyball team.

This afternoon, the powerful Cuban team faced the newly formed Japanese team. Although the Cuban team won 3-2, the victory was not easy, as they faced strong resistance from the young Japanese team.

Tomorrow evening, the Chinese team will compete against the Cuban team for the first place in this invitational tournament. In the afternoon, the U.S. and Japanese teams will compete for third place.

　　四国女排邀请赛在成都开战
    中国女排首战三比○胜美国队
    新华社成都５月２３日电  （记者徐波、李贺普）今晚，在成都举行的四国女排邀请赛上，中国队首战美国队，结果以３∶０的优势获胜。
    ３局的比分是１５∶１０、１５∶４、１５∶６。
    中美两队均是汉城奥运会后新组建的队伍，是奥运会后的首次交锋。中国队今天上场的基本阵容是１号赖亚文、２号李国君、４号周红、６号何云舒、７号苏惠娟和８号李云武。主力队员、四川选手巫丹今天未与家乡观众见面。李月明因病未来成都参加这次比赛。显而易见，中国队并没有排出最强阵容。
    在比赛中，观众席上有“重振雄风”的横幅，表达了人们对中国女排的期望。
    今天下午，实力强大的古巴队与新组成的日本队交锋。古巴队虽然以３∶２获胜，但是赢得并不轻松，受到了年轻的日本队的顽强抵抗。
    明天晚上中国队将同古巴队争夺这次邀请赛的第一名。下午美国队和日本队争夺第三名。
