Title: Many Problems in Yangtze River Navigation

In recent years, Yangtze River navigation has seen a situation where "everyone takes to the water" and "state-owned, collective, and individual enterprises all participate." The utilization rate of Yangtze River navigation has doubled compared to 1978. However, several concerning issues have also emerged:

Freight rates are too low, and various price ratios are unreasonable. Taking the transportation of coal as an example, the freight rate for 1,000 ton-kilometers is about 17 yuan, which is significantly lower than the freight rates of other transportation methods. Last year, the Chongqing and Wuhu branches of the Yangtze River Steamship Company both incurred losses of over 300 million yuan. In Jiangsu Province, which has relatively good local navigation conditions, the loss rate of county-level and above navigation enterprises reached over 30%. We have learned that the plans issued by the Ministry of Communications and relevant departments lack binding force. In recent years, the fulfillment rate of plans for upstream ports on the Yangtze River has been only 30% to 50%, and for downstream ports, it has been only 50% to 70%. The phenomenon of ships and ports being overloaded is very serious. The crew of the barge Jia 21125 reported that once, after delivering pig iron to Shanghai, they anchored for over two months without anyone unloading the cargo.

Multiple authorities issue orders, leaving enterprises at a loss. Currently, the departments exercising administrative authority on the Yangtze River include both those under the central government and those under provincial governments. Departments such as maritime administration, port administration, fishery administration, urban construction, taxation, industry and commerce, maritime public security, and water resources and hydropower can all issue orders, causing navigation enterprises to be at a loss and complain endlessly. The collection of ship and port fees varies by region and department, leaving ship units confused. When the Wuhan Yangtze River Steamship Company set up a passenger terminal in Wuchang, both the Wuhan Port Authority and the Wuhan Maritime Administration Office insisted on collecting ship and port fees, each citing their own "regulations." Due to the lack of unified national port regulations, the phenomenon of multiple authorities managing ports is quite serious. It is understood that even a medium-sized port like Wanzhou has six management departments for its wharves. When problems arise, they either pass the buck to each other and delay action, or simply wash their hands of the matter, resulting in increasing conflicts and disorder.

Using ships for personal gain, and the industry's unhealthy practices are rampant. In recent years, the entire East China region and parts of Central South China have faced energy shortages, with significant gaps in industrial and civilian coal supply; building materials are in high demand in the Southeast coastal region. Thus, some shipping units and "middlemen" have exploited geographical, personal, and cargo source relationships to demand various fees from cargo owners, such as living allowance fees, detention fees, cargo hold cleaning fees, hardship fees, information fees, and so on. For example, a certain "middleman" leveraged his relative, who is the manager of a shipping company, to use the company's ships to transport coal from Qingjiang River Coal Mine to Nanjing and Shanghai, collecting 1 yuan per ton as a "handling fee," earning thousands of yuan in just a few days. Some passenger ships, after being contracted out, prioritize income over service, finding every possible way to squeeze money from passengers, such as selling lower berths with additional conditions.

### 长江航运问题多

　　长江航运问题多
    近几年来，长江航运出现了“有水大家走”、“国营、集体、个体一起上”的局面。长江航运利用率比１９７８年翻了一番。但是，也出现一些令人忧虑的问题：
    运价太低，各种比价关系不合理。以运输煤炭为例，１０００吨公里运价约１７元，大大低于其它运输工具的运价。去年，长江轮船总公司重庆、芜湖等分公司都亏损３００多万元。地方航运条件较好的江苏省，县以上航运企业的亏损面达３０％以上。我们了解到，交通部和有关部门下达的计划没有约束力。这几年来，长江上游港计划的兑现率只有３０％—５０％，下游港的计划兑现率也只有５０％—７０％，压船压港的现象十分严重。甲２１１２５驳船船员反映，有一次装运生铁抵达上海后一锚泊就是两个多月，无人卸货。
    政出多门，企业无所适从。目前在长江上行使政务管理权的，有部属的，也有省属的。航政、港政、渔政、城建、税务、工商、水上公安、水利水电等部门都可以发号施令，致使航运企业无所适从，叫苦连天。征收船舶港务费，各地有各地的做法，各部门有各部门的文件，搞得船舶单位糊里糊涂。武汉长江轮船公司在武昌设客运码头时，武汉港务局和武汉市航管处都争着收取船舶港务费，并各自搬出自己的“规定”。由于国家没有统一的港口法规，多头管理港口的现象相当严重。据了解，仅万县港这个中等港口，码头管理部门就有６个，一遇到问题，不是相互扯皮拖着不办，就是撒手不管，结果矛盾越来越多，秩序越来越乱。
    以船谋私，行业歪风猖獗。近年来，整个华东和部分中南地区能源紧张，工业和民用煤炭出现了较大缺口；东南沿海地区建筑材料走俏。这样，一些有船单位和“中间人”便利用地缘、人缘、货源关系向货主索要各种小费，诸如生活补贴费、滞港费、扒舱费、辛苦费、信息费等等。如某“中间人”依仗亲戚是某船公司的经理，利用这家公司的船在清江河煤矿装煤运往南京、上海，每吨煤收取１元“手续费”，几天就赚数千元。有的客轮承包后，重收入，轻服务，想方设法从旅客身上捞油水，如卖下铺非得带附加条件。
