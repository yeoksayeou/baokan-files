Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 27th.

	Shanxi Province's coal mines have been striving to overcome production difficulties, maintaining a steady growth in raw coal production. In the first four months of this year, they produced 75.12 million tons of raw coal, which is 30.7% of the annual plan and an 8.1% increase over the same period last year.

	Since the beginning of this year, coal mines across Shanxi Province have faced shortages of grain and electricity. Particularly in some regions, township coal mines have seen a decline in production. After the State Council implemented a series of preferential measures, the mines mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties, and the production of local and township coal mines began to rebound.

	Relevant officials noted that a prominent issue in Shanxi Province's coal production is the impact of non-planned coal transportation on the state plan. By the end of April, local coal mines in the province had only completed 69.38% of the state's mandatory transportation plan. Officials believe that if this trend is not curbed quickly, it will inevitably lead to overproduction in coal mines and overloading of railways, while key users guaranteed by the state will not receive coal.

　　山西煤炭生产持续增长
    据新华社太原５月２７日电  （记者崔济哲）山西省各煤矿努力克服生产中遇到的困难，使原煤生产保持稳步增长的势头，今年头４个月共产原煤７５１２万吨，为年计划的３０．７％，比去年同期增长８．１％。
    今年以来，山西省各煤矿普遍缺粮缺电，特别是一些地区的乡镇煤矿，生产一度出现滑坡现象，国务院采取一系列优惠措施以后，各矿广泛发动群众，克服困难，地方和乡镇煤矿的生产开始出现回升。
    有关人士说，山西省目前煤炭生产中存在一个突出问题，计划外煤炭运销冲击了国家计划。到４月底，全省地方煤矿只完成国家指令性运销计划的６９．３８％。有关人士认为，这种势态如不尽快刹住，势必出现煤矿超产、铁路超运，而国家必保的一大批重点用户拿不上煤的怪现象。
