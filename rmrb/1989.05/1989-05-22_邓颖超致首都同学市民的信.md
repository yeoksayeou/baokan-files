Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 22nd.

Dear students and citizens,

In the past few days, I have received numerous calls, letters, and messages from various sources, reflecting the situation in Beijing and the aspirations of the people. I am also deeply concerned and anxious about the situation in Beijing over the past month. I believe no one wants this situation to continue. Everyone hopes for stability and unity. In recent days, there have been many rumors circulating, including some about me. I hope everyone does not believe these rumors.

As an old Communist Party member, I have always had deep feelings for the children, hoping they will grow up to contribute to the country and the people, becoming talents who love the country, love the people, and are dedicated to building the nation.

As a citizen of Beijing, I have the same responsibility as everyone else to consciously maintain the stability and honor of the capital.

Dear students and citizens, I sincerely hope that you will trust the Party, trust the government, and trust the People's Liberation Army. This time, the People's Liberation Army has entered Beijing to maintain social order and ensure that everyone has a normal environment for work, study, and life. I hope that all students and citizens will give their full support.

I hope that all students will return to school as soon as possible and resume normal school life.

I believe that you will, with a high sense of patriotism and responsibility, help the Party, the government, and the People's Liberation Army to successfully complete the task of restoring normal order in the capital.

I sincerely thank the medical staff, public security officers, armed police, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have been on duty day and night to maintain the order of the capital and ensure the safety and health of students and citizens, as well as comrades on all fronts!

Thank you all.

I wish you all good health!

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 22nd.

　　邓颖超致首都同学市民的信
    亲爱的同学们、市民们：
    几天来，我不断接到各方面的来电、来信和电话，他们向我反映北京市出现的情况和他们的心愿。我也对北京近一个月来出现的局面极为关切、极为焦虑。我想大家谁也不愿意这种局面再继续下去了，大家都希望安定团结。这几天，社会上的谣言很多，对我的谣传也不少，我希望大家不要相信。
    我作为一名老共产党员，从来对孩子们是有深厚感情的，希望孩子们长大为祖国、为人民做贡献，成为爱祖国、爱人民、建设祖国的有用人才。
    我作为一名北京的市民和大家一样有责任自觉维护首都的安定和荣誉。
    亲爱的同学们、市民们，我恳切希望你们要相信党，相信人民政府，相信人民解放军。这次解放军奉命进驻北京是为了维护首都的社会秩序，保证大家有一个正常的工作、学习和生活环境。我希望广大同学和市民给予大力支持。
    希望广大同学尽快返回学校，恢复正常的学校生活。
    我相信，你们一定会以高度的爱国心和责任感，帮助党和政府以及人民解放军顺利完成恢复首都正常秩序的任务。
    我衷心地感谢日夜坚守工作岗位、为维护首都秩序、为保证同学们和市民们的安全、健康做出贡献的广大医务人员、公安干警、武警和人民解放军指战员，以及各条战线的同志们！
    谢谢大家。
　　祝同学们和市民们身体健康！　　　　　　（新华社北京５月２２日电）
