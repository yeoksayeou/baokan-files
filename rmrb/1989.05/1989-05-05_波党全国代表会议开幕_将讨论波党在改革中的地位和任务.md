The National Conference of the Polish United Workers' Party opened on May 4 in the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw. Over 1,700 representatives of the 10th Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party attended the meeting. They will summarize the work done since the 10th Congress of the Polish United Workers' Party in 1986 and discuss the party's role and tasks in the reform process.

The delegates will review and discuss the guiding report submitted by the Central Political Bureau and pass relevant resolutions.

In his opening speech, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jaruzelski, pointed out that although much work has been done and many innovative decisions have been made since the 10th Congress, the expected progress has not been achieved. The problem lies in the fact that the party, as the driving force behind historical and revolutionary changes, has changed too slowly. He emphasized that the party's work style must be modernized, and the party must learn to become a party that is suitable for new tasks and new requirements. Reforms must be carried out in many aspects, but the party's ideological appearance must be better maintained. It is not allowed to change color and betray the great ideals.

When talking about domestic economic issues, Jaruzelski said, "The Round Table Conference" found an olive branch, but did not find a magic wand to get out of the crisis. The internal and external conditions for implementing reforms are still very difficult. Many things depend on ourselves, on overcoming conservative thinking.

Jaruzelski also mentioned that there are still many extremists in Poland at present. They showed themselves again on May 1st. This should not be overestimated, but it should not be ignored either.

The conference will last for two days.

　　波党全国代表会议开幕    
    将讨论波党在改革中的地位和任务
    本报柏林５月５日电  记者许宏治报道：波兰统一工人党全国代表会议５月４日在华沙文化科学宫开幕。波党１０大的１７００多名代表出席了会议，他们将对１９８６年波党１０大以来的工作进行总结，并就党在改革过程中的地位和任务问题进行讨论。
    与会代表将对中央政治局提出的纲领性报告进行审议，并通过有关决议。
    波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基致开幕词。他指出，从１０大以来的这段时间虽然做了很多工作，作出了许多创新的决定，但没有取得预期的进展。问题在于党作为历史性、革命性变革的推动者，本身的变革太慢了。他强调，党的工作作风必须现代化，党必须进行学习，成为适合新任务、新要求的政党。必须在许多方面进行改革，但是必须更好地维护党的思想面貌，决不允许改变颜色，背叛伟大的理想。
    在谈到国内经济问题时，雅鲁泽尔斯基说，“圆桌会议”找到了橄榄枝，但并未找到走出危机的魔棍。实现改革的内外条件仍是非常困难的。许多事情取决于我们自己，取决于克服保守思想。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基还谈到，目前在波兰仍有不少极端派。“五·一”时他们再次表现了自己。对此不必估计过高，但也不可忽视。
    这次会议将举行两天。
