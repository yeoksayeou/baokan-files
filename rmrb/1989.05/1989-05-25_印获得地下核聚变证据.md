Indian scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre have obtained evidence suggesting that nuclear fusion may be occurring approximately 50 kilometers beneath the Earth's surface.

The director of the research centre, Bikash Sinha, stated that this conclusion was reached during a three-week geothermal exploration in Birbhum district of West Bengal and Santal Parganas district of Bihar. During this period, a significant amount of helium gas was observed to be emanating from the hot springs.

He explained that the large release of helium gas from the hot springs is indicative of nuclear fusion occurring deep within the Earth's crust.

　　印获得地下核聚变证据
    新华社新德里电  印度巴巴原子研究中心的科学家获得距地面约５０公里深处可能出现核聚变的证据。
    该研究中心的主任比卡什·辛哈说，他们是在西孟加拉邦的比尔普姆县和比哈尔邦的桑塔尔·巴尔加纳斯县进行为期３周的温泉勘探中，发现有大量的氦气喷出而得出这一结论的。
    他说，大量的氦气从温泉喷出是地壳深处发生核聚变的一个证据。
