Recently, Chen Daoming, who played Puyi in *The Last Emperor*, won the Best Actor award at the Ninth "Flying Apsaras Award" for his outstanding performance.

The young actor Chen Daoming's portrayal of the character Puyi is already unique in terms of his historical life prototype. When transformed into an artistic image, his legendary, unique, and complex nature becomes even stronger. The character's fate and repeated transformations, as well as the role's multiple layers and facets, have made the performance creation extremely challenging. Chen Daoming, within the framework of transforming from a human to a god, from a god to a ghost, and then back to a human, grasped the main behaviors and life layers of the character. He also spent a considerable amount of effort on detailed creation, thus step by step, layer by layer, bringing out the character's development and portraying the role's complex personality.

After taking over the baton from two young actors to create the screen image of Puyi, Chen Daoming entered the in-depth stage of showcasing this character's complex spiritual life. The Beijing period (episodes 8 to 11) consists of four episodes. The character's situation and behavior are extremely passive, like "a jade bird kept by people." However, the young Puyi, whose worldview is gradually forming, has very active thoughts and is full of inner conflicts. The desire to break out of the "yellow circle" and seek freedom, along with the long-held dream of restoring imperial power, constantly clash in his heart. The guidance from two teachers who are completely different also makes him look left and right, confused and uncertain. The actor's portrayal of these conflicting thoughts and behavioral searches is relatively accurate and vivid. For example, in the scenes where he saws the doorstep and cuts his queue, the performance is full of passion; the scene where he learns to ride a bicycle appears humorous on the surface, with a touch of comedy, but deep down, it reveals the endless sorrow and hope in his heart; looking up at the freely flying pigeons, his eyes reflect the surging waves of his heart; after being expelled from the palace, looking back at the palace walls from the car, seeing the setting sun, his heart is also shrouded in twilight. Although he has already left the "yellow circle" he longed to escape, at that moment, he still yearns for the paradise he has lost...

The Tianjin period (episodes 12 to 16) is a crucial stage in the character's personality formation and fate development, and it is also the part with the heaviest psychological drama. Puyi is unwilling to be bound by the new "yellow circle" and plans to accumulate strength to restore the Qing dynasty. The Japanese imperialists are also plotting to force cooperation... In this part, there are not only complicated political struggles but also sensational events like the Wenxiu divorce case, involving private life and emotional entanglements. Puyi has to enter the psychological battlefield filled with dangers. Chen Daoming's performance is more profound than before. He uses various details to portray the character's loss,困顿, longing, dreams, crises, and hopes, among other feelings, relatively accurately. Moreover, in grasping the character's life and emotional threads, he also shows considerable creativity. Inheriting the decadent and licentious legacy of his predecessors, he faces the hopelessness of luxury and the inability to indulge in pleasure. Political crises and personal life crises intertwine, presenting some psychological and personality abnormalities. This is reflected in the actor's eyes, posture, breathing, and several subtle feelings, making the character more three-dimensional and multifaceted.

From episode 17 to episode 22, the character's complete image as a puppet of Japanese imperialism, a traitor, and the emperor of the puppet Manchukuo is fully realized before being captured, reformed, and starting anew. The character's psychological state of both deep guilt and being coerced, as well as the factors of personality, emotions, and moods such as selfishness, cruelty, fear, stubbornness, weakness, sorrow, eccentricity, and shamelessness, are all felt and embodied by the actor. The scenes of the third coronation, the death of Tan Yuling, and after the so-called "Jewel Voice Broadcast" of the Emperor's unconditional surrender are all performed with considerable skill.

Overall, Chen Daoming's creation of the screen image of Puyi is successful and outstanding. This young actor entered the Tianjin People's Art Theater in the early 1970s and later, in the late 1970s, enrolled in the Central Academy of Drama for further studies, systematically studying the art of performance. He has good internal and external professional qualities, is diligent in his studies, and is multi-talented. In addition to acting, he is also skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, painting, recitation, and dance, which laid a good foundation for his later creation of the image of Puyi in terms of temperament and endowment. The systematic acquisition of role creation methods is closely related to his training and tempering in the graduation performances *Qu Yuan* (playing Song Yu) and *The Innocent Criminal* (playing Neznamov). He has also created screen images in the films *One and Eight*, *Eight Banner Descendants*, and *Massacre Evidence*. If we talk about his shortcomings and regrets in creating the screen image of Puyi, of course, there are! It mainly manifests in the overall performance of the play, where there is too much explanatory, formal, and design consciousness, while the true liberation of the actor's nature, the ease of the role's actions, and the authenticity of living as the role are still lacking.

　　演出人物的精神来
    ——记第九届“飞天奖”最佳男主角陈道明
    赵健
    最近，在《末代皇帝》中饰演溥仪的陈道明，因其出众的演技而荣获第九届“飞天奖”最佳男主角奖。
    青年演员陈道明所饰演的主角溥仪这个人物的历史生活原型已极独特，化为艺术形象其传奇性、独特性、复杂性则更强。人物的命运发展与反复异化，角色的多种层次与多个侧面，注定了表演创造的艰难。陈道明在从人到神、从神到鬼、从神鬼复归为人的大框架中，把握了角色主要行为与生活脉络层次，又在细部创造上花费了相当多的心血。从而一步步、一层层地演出了人物的发展，刻画了角色的复杂性格。
    陈道明从两位小演员手中接过创造溥仪屏幕形象的接力棒后，就进入了展示这一人物复杂精神生活的深入阶段。北京时期（８至１１集）共四集戏。人物的处境与行为是异常被动的，就像是“人们供养的一只玉鸟”。但处在世界观逐渐形成时期的青年溥仪，思想又非常活跃，且充满内心矛盾。冲出“黄圈圈”寻找自由的愿望与留恋皇权、恢复帝业的梦想长久在心头搏击，两位老师大相径庭的引导，也使他左顾右盼、困惑无常。人物的这些矛盾心理与行为求索被演员表现得较为准确鲜明。如剧中锯门槛、剪辫子等处的戏充满激情；学自行车的戏表面显得可笑，似有喜剧气味，但在深处却隐涌出心头无限的悲苦与企望；仰视空中自由飞翔的白鸽，从眼神里折射出心潮不停翻滚的波涛；被逐出宫后，在车内回望宫墙，见残阳夕照，心中也为暮色笼罩，虽已离开久欲冲出的“黄圈圈”，彼时彼刻却又无限依恋那确已失去的天堂……陈道明在这些地方的表演，都深刻揭示了人物复杂的心理矛盾。
    天津时期（１２至１６集）是人物性格全面形成和命运发展的重要关头，也是心理戏最重的部分。溥仪不甘受新的“黄圈圈”的羁绊，图谋积蓄力量，复辟满清帝业。日本帝国主义者也在阴谋策划胁迫合作……在这部分戏中，不仅有错综复杂的政治斗争，而且有轰动一时的文绣离婚案等私生活与感情纠纷，溥仪不得不投进危机四伏中的心理战场。陈道明的表演较前更为深化。他以种种细节刻画把人物的失落、困顿、企求、梦幻、危机、希望……等等感觉都较准确地创造出来，而且在人物的生活与情感线索的把握上也颇有创造。承袭了先辈们昏庸淫逸的遗风，却面临着奢侈的无望与淫乐的无能，政治危机与私生活危机交织一起，呈现了某些心理与性格的变态，这在演员的眼神里、体态上、呼吸间以及若干处细微感觉中都有表露，从而使人物更富立体感和多面性。
    从第１７集至第２２集中，是迄于被俘虏、被改造、重新做人之前做为日本帝国主义傀儡、大卖国贼、伪满洲国皇帝形象的全面完成。人物既罪恶深重又累受胁迫的心理和人物性格因素、情绪色采中的自私、残忍、恐惧、刚愎、软弱、忧伤、孤癖、无耻等等方面都为演员所感悟并体现。第三次登极、谭玉龄之死、听天皇无条件投降的所谓“玉音放送”之后等处的戏，演员演得都颇见功力。
    纵观陈道明创造的溥仪屏幕形象，应当说是成功而出色的。这位青年演员于７０年代初期进入天津人民艺术剧院，７０年代末期又考入中央戏剧学院深造，系统研修表演艺术。他有良好的内外部专业素质，勤于学业，且多才多艺。除了演戏，琴棋书画与朗诵、舞蹈亦有所长，这对后来能够创造溥仪形象在气质禀赋方面已有很合拍的先期奠底。而系统创造角色方法的获得，不能不与他在毕业剧目《屈原》（饰宋玉）、《无辜的罪人》（饰涅兹那莫夫）中的修炼、砥砺密切关联。他还曾在电影《一个和八个》、《八旗子弟》、《屠城血证》中塑造过银幕形象。如果说到他在创造溥仪屏幕形象中的不足与缺憾，当然有！主要表现在整个戏的表演中说明性、形式感和设计意识多了些，而真正演员天性的解放和角色行动运行的自如以及化身为角色的生活逼真感等方面尚嫌不足。
