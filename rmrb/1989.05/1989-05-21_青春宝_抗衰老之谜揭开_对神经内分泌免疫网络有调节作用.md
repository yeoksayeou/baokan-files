The mystery behind the renowned "Qingchunbao" in delaying human aging has been unveiled. Experts from Shanghai Medical University and Zhejiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine have conducted preliminary research, concluding that this drug has a significant regulatory effect on the "neuroendocrine immune network," which plays a crucial role in human aging. It can help resist the onset of tumors, infections, and autoimmune diseases.

Medical experts from Shanghai and Hangzhou conducted a study on 106 elderly individuals who took "Qingchunbao" to investigate its anti-aging mechanisms. The results showed that "Qingchunbao" can enhance the activity of "natural killer cells" (NK cells) by more than 30%, significantly improving the body's first line of defense against tumors and viruses. Simultaneously, it increases the transformation rate of lymphocytes, which are essential for immune function, by 30%, thereby enhancing the body's ability to recognize and kill virus-infected cells (tumors).

The research also demonstrated that the decline in the "sodium pump" function of red blood cells, which involves the self-regulation of sodium and potassium, is a sign of cellular aging and an important indicator of early aging in the entire body. "Qingchunbao" can significantly enhance the activity of red blood cells in the elderly, restoring the "active transport" function of red blood cells in sodium and potassium regulation, bringing the "sodium pump" function of the elderly closer to that of younger individuals.

Shanghai Medical University, Zhejiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and China Qingchunbao Company recently released the above information in Shanghai.

　　“青春宝”抗衰老之谜揭开
    对神经内分泌免疫网络有调节作用
    本报上海５月２１日电  记者萧关根报道：驰名中外的“青春宝”延缓人体衰老的奥秘是什么呢？上海医科大学和浙江中医学院的专家们研究的初步结论是：此药对人体衰老起关键作用的“神经内分泌免疫网络”有着明显的调节作用，可以抵御肿瘤、感染与自身免疫系统等疾病的发生。上海和杭州的医学专家对服用“青春宝”的１０６名老人进行了抗衰老机理研究，结果证明，“青春宝”能提高“自然杀伤细胞”（ＮＫ）的活性３０％以上，使人体中这个杀肿瘤、抗病毒的第一道防线获得了显著的调节效应；同时，对体内实现免疫功能所必需的淋巴细胞转化率也增强了３０％，明显增强了识别与杀伤毒变细胞（肿瘤）的活力。
    研究结果还证明，人体中红细胞自身排钠保钾的“钠泵”功能降低，是细胞衰老的表现，也是整个机体早期衰老的重要指症。“青春宝”可以明显提高老年人的红细胞活性，恢复红细胞排钠保钾的“主动泵运”作用，使老年人的“钠泵”功能提高到接近年轻人的水平。
    上海医科大学、浙江中医学院和中国青春宝公司日前在上海发布了上述信息。
