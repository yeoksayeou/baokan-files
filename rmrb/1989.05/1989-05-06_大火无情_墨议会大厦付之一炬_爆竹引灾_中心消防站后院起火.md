People's Daily, Mexico City, May 5th

A day of fire disaster in Mexican history: Within 15 hours, two major fires first reduced the magnificent Mexican Legislative Assembly building to ashes, followed by an explosion in the backyard of the central fire station in Mexico City, where 1.5 tons of firecrackers were stored. The two fires caused billions of pesos in damage and resulted in 51 casualties.

At around 3:30 AM today, the "San Lazaro" National Legislative Assembly building in Mexico suddenly caught fire. Firefighters rushed to the scene but were delayed due to malfunctioning fire safety equipment inside and outside the building. The raging flames quickly engulfed the entire central part of the building. By dawn, although the fire was brought under control, until noon, black smoke was still rising from the building. The grand central conference hall was reduced to ruins, with debris scattered everywhere. The fire destroyed 40% of the entire building complex, including the ceremonial hall, conference hall, foyer, green hall, closed-circuit television system, and news center. Among the losses was a mural original titled "The History of the Mexican Constitution," meticulously carved and assembled from cedar wood, measuring 30 meters long and 350 square meters in area. Fortunately, the legislative archives were stored in the basement and were not destroyed. Due to the nighttime fire, there was only one death and one injury. Preliminary investigations suggest that the fire was caused by a short circuit in the wiring of the hall.

Just as Mexicans were deeply regretting the fire at the Legislative Assembly building, at 5:45 PM the same day, 1.5 tons of firecrackers stored in the courtyard of the central fire station in Mexico City exploded. Firefighters playing basketball in the courtyard were caught off guard, resulting in 49 injuries, including 15 firefighters.

Today is a national holiday in Mexico, commemorating the 127th anniversary of the Battle of Puebla against French invasion. However, the massive losses caused by the two fires cast a shadow over the commemorative activities.

### 大火无情　墨议会大厦付之一炬  爆竹引灾　中心消防站后院起火

　　大火无情　墨议会大厦付之一炬   
    爆竹引灾　中心消防站后院起火
    本报墨西哥城５月５日电  记者郭伟成报道：１９８９年５月５日将成为墨西哥历史上的火灾灾难日：在１５小时内的两场大火，先是将雄伟壮观的墨西哥立法议会大厦中心建筑付之一炬，随后，墨西哥城中心消防站“后院”起火，存放在那儿的１吨半爆竹发生爆炸。两把火烧掉数十亿比索，造成５１人伤亡。
    今天凌晨３点３０分左右，墨西哥“圣·拉萨罗”国家立法议会大厦突然失火。消防队员闻讯赶到，却因大厦内外消防设施失灵贻误战机，熊熊烈火瞬间吞没了整个中心建筑部分。到天亮时分，虽然火势得到控制，但是，直到中午，大厦中还冒出缕缕黑烟。富丽堂皇的中心会议大厅烧成一片废墟，遍地狼藉。经查勘，火烧面积占整个建筑群的４０％，包括典礼厅、会议厅、前厅、绿厅、闭路电视系统、新闻中心等中心部位。其中还包括一幅全部用雪松木精心镶刻、拼嵌、长３０米、３５０平方米见方的壁画原作《墨西哥宪法历史》。幸而议会档案材料因保存在地下层而未遭毁灭。由于夜间起火，仅死伤各一人。据初步判断，起火是由于大厅里电线短路引起。
    正当墨西哥人为立法议会大厦起火深感惋惜的时候，当天下午１７点４５分，墨西哥城中心消防站院内存放的１．５吨爆竹发生爆炸。正在院内玩篮球的消防队员们措手不及，结果，造成４９人负伤，其中１５人是消防队员。
    今天，是墨西哥国定假日，纪念历史上抗击法国侵略的普埃布拉战役１２７周年，但是两场大火造成的巨大损失给纪念活动蒙上了阴影。
