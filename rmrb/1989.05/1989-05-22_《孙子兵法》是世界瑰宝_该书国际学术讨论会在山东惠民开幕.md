The first international academic symposium on "The Art of War by Sun Tzu" was held today in Huimin County, Shandong Province, the hometown of Sun Tzu, the military sage of China.

"The Art of War by Sun Tzu," which has been in existence for 2,501 years, is a classic of Chinese military science. It is not only a source of pride for the Chinese people but also a treasure for people around the world. More than 50 military science experts from within China and scholars from the United States, France, and Japan who traveled from afar gathered to discuss Sun Tzu's strategic thought of "subduing the enemy without fighting" and its role in promoting world peace. They explored the profound ideas of "The Art of War by Sun Tzu" in the fields of military, politics, economics, and philosophy, and its effective application in contemporary times.

Polak, a renowned scholar from the Rand Corporation in the United States, said that "The Art of War by Sun Tzu" is an important course in American military academies. Sun Tzu's wisdom is eternal and belongs to the whole world. Hattori Chikamasa, a Japanese Sun Tzu researcher and businessman, presented his new work, "An Annotated Translation of The Art of War by Sun Tzu," to the symposium.
