Hu Wan Kai, a resident of a certain town in Cangnan County, Zhejiang Province, frequently quarreled with his wife, Chen. Chen then returned to her maternal home. Hu gathered about 20 people to go to his mother-in-law's house to bring his wife back. On the way, they encountered Chen. Hu grabbed Chen's hair, and the others rushed forward, striking Chen with an iron ruler and knocking her to the ground. They then grabbed her hands and feet and dragged her through the streets. Hu's accomplices even stripped off Chen's shorts and shirt and subjected her to lewd acts of humiliation. Recently, the county's People's Court sentenced Hu Wan Kai to three years in prison.

In January of this year, Zhou Qunying, a woman from Jian Shi Village, Yuxian County, Guangdong Province, bravely fought a masked burglar who had broken into her home in the early hours of the 10th. This pregnant woman, who was six months along, sustained multiple injuries. The police have since apprehended the criminal, Zhong Jintian.
