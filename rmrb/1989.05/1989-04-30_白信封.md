It is once again that most ordinary white envelope, and that small piece of white paper, like flakes of crystal snow, drifting into our humble abode...

This is a letter from the venerable Ms. Bing Xin. Every time, it is the same white envelope and that small piece of white paper. Every time, it is like sitting face to face in the old lady's simple living room, listening to her chat about family matters in a warm and intimate way.

Originally, elders do not need to be so serious about replying to every letter from their juniors, especially someone like Ms. Bing Xin, who is highly respected and whose time is extremely precious. However, she always replies so carefully and promptly, and the date of her reply can even be counted on one's fingers. This time, she replied so quickly, which was really beyond our expectations. Therefore, when we received that familiar small snowflake-like white envelope, we couldn't help but feel waves of emotion in our hearts.

A couple of years ago, when we were working in Lebanon, we visited the hometown of Kahlil Gibran and discussed with the director of the Gibran Museum, Mr. Kurus, how more than half a century ago, the famous Chinese female writer Bing Xin had translated Gibran's representative work, "The Prophet," which is praised as "the most beautiful voice in the East," into Chinese. He was very happy and repeatedly asked us to help find a Chinese translation for the museum. During our vacation back in China, we specially visited Ms. Bing Xin. She not only generously took out the only newly published copy of "The Prophet" she had, but also personally copied the section "On Friendship" from "The Prophet" and gave it to us to mount and present to the museum. Now, these have been preserved as symbols of friendship between China and Lebanon, cherished in the Gibran Museum and in the hearts of the Lebanese people. We described these processes in the essay collection "Lebanon Sketches." A few days ago, we received the sample books sent by the publisher and immediately sent them to Ms. Bing Xin. To avoid wasting more of her time, we included a note in the sections mentioning her, so she could read them at her leisure. Unexpectedly, after just four or five days, we received her reply. Excluding the time for postal delivery, she had read the entire book of over ten thousand words in just one or two days, and "paid special attention to the parts with inserted paper."

Facing this simple page and this ordinary white envelope, our hearts could not calm down for a long time.

I remember reading the "Bing Xin Collection" in the past, and seeing the old lady's remarks on stationery:

I personally think that, except for those with patterns, it is better to prepare more white paper and envelopes. Many people, like me, when writing letters, prefer to write freely and without distractions on a piece of white paper or paper with only lines.

This suddenly reminded us of a sentence by Balzac: "All truly great people are very 'natural,' and their 'naturalness' makes you feel equal to them." Ms. Bing Xin is like her name—pure and transparent, with not a hint of arrogance, officialdom, or worldliness that great writers or other great figures often have. The old lady has always advocated "telling the truth," without embellishment, without vanity, without twisting and turning, without flashy tricks... Even the envelopes and paper, she prefers them to be clean and white, so she can write freely and without distractions on them...

Isn't this the true nature of Ms. Bing Xin?

　　白信封 
    彭龄　章谊 
   又是那种最普通的白信封，又是那一张小小的白信纸，像一片片晶莹的雪花，飘进我们寒伧的居室……
    这是冰心老人的来信。每次都是这样的白信封和这一小片白信纸。每次都像面对面坐在老人简朴的客厅里，听她叙家常般亲切温馨。
    本来，长辈对于晚辈，似乎不必那么认真地每信必复，特别是像冰心这样德高望重、时间又异常宝贵的老人。然而，她每次总这样认真、仔细，复信的日子甚至可屈指算出。这次，竟复得这么快，实在出乎我们意料。所以，当我们接过那熟悉的小小的雪片似的白信封时，心湖里不能不激起一阵阵涟漪。
    前两年，我们在黎巴嫩工作，去造访纪伯伦的故乡时，与纪伯伦博物馆馆长库鲁兹先生谈起，早在半个多世纪前，中国著名女作家冰心，就将被誉为“东方最美妙的声音”的纪伯伦的代表作《先知》译成了中文。他听后非常高兴，一再恳请我们设法为博物馆找一本中译本。我们回国休假期间，专门为此拜访了冰心老人。她不仅慨然取出手边仅存的一册新版的《先知》，而且还亲笔抄录了《先知》中《论友谊》一节，交我们裱成立轴，一并赠给博物馆。现在，这些都已作为中黎两国友谊的象征，珍藏在纪伯伦博物馆中，珍藏在黎巴嫩人民心中了。我们在散文集《黎巴嫩散记》中，将这些过程作了陈述。前几天，我们收到出版社寄来的样书，立即寄奉冰心老人。为怕浪费她更多时间，在提到她的那几篇文章里夹了纸条，以便她暇时随便翻翻。不料，仅仅隔了四五天，便收到她的复信。除去邮局周转递送的时间，她竟在一两天内将这本十多万字的书统统读过了，而且“夹白纸处更为仔细”。
    面对这一页素简和这枚普普通通的白信封，我们的心久久不能平静。
    记得过去读《冰心文集》时，曾看到老人对信纸发过的一番感慨：
    我自己以为，除了印有花样的以外，白信纸信封不妨多预备一点，不少人像我一样，在写信的时候，喜欢在一张白纸或只带着道道的纸上，不受拘束地，心无旁鹜地抒写下去。
    这忽然令我们想起巴尔扎克说过的一句话：“一切真正伟大的人物都是很‘本色’的，而他们的‘本色’就是使你觉得和他们平等。”冰心老人正像她的名字一样——冰晶玉洁，一清见底，没有丝毫大作家或其它大人物的傲气、官气、世俗气。老人一贯主张“讲真话”，不要粉饰，不要虚浮，不要拐弯抹角，花里胡哨……连信封信纸，她都喜欢白白净净，好在上面“不受拘束地，心无旁鹜地抒写下去……”
    这，不正是冰心老人的“本色”吗？
