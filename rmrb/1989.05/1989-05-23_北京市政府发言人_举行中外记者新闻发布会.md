Beijing Municipal Government Spokesperson Holds Press Conference for Domestic and Foreign Journalists

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 23: Beijing Municipal Government Spokesperson Ding Weijun held a press conference for domestic and foreign journalists at the Jingfeng Bin Hotel this evening. At the conference, Fengtai District Deputy District Chief Ye Shangshi reported on the incident that occurred on May 22 near Daping in Fengtai District, where soldiers from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were on duty enforcing martial law, were injured.

Ye Shangshi said that around 10 PM on May 22, a unit of the People's Liberation Army, which was enforcing martial law and had been stopped, was ordered to relocate. After reaching an agreement with the students and with the students' help in maintaining order, the unit began to relocate. At this time, an unidentified person spread rumors and incited trouble. Some people of unknown identity, who were mixed in with the students and onlookers, attacked the soldiers with bricks and stones they had prepared in advance. During this process, the students asked those people to stop, but the students were also attacked. The soldiers maintained high restraint, withdrawing while protecting the students. In this process, more than 60 soldiers were injured, with 17 hospitalized, 4 seriously injured, some with 9 stitches on their heads, and some with broken fingers. At the same time, 11 students were lightly injured, and another 12 were lightly injured, with 1 seriously injured. During this process, 10 people were detained by the soldiers and handed over to the public security authorities. These people have been detained for investigation, including 5 from out of town and 5 from Beijing. None of them are students. On the morning of May 23, Beijing Municipal Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa and Municipal Government Secretary-General Tie Ying visited the hospital to see the injured soldiers.

A video of the incident was also shown at the press conference. The video included damaged houses, shattered glass, and the ground around the houses covered with debris. There were also a few injured soldiers.

At the conference, Ding Weijun and Ye Shangshi also answered questions from domestic and foreign journalists.

　　北京市政府发言人
    举行中外记者新闻发布会
    新华社北京５月２３日电  北京市政府发言人丁维峻今晚在京丰宾馆举行中外记者新闻发布会。会上，北京市丰台区常务副区长叶上诗介绍了２２日发生在丰台区大井附近执行戒严任务的解放军某部战士被打伤的情况。
    叶上诗说，２２日晚１０时左右，在丰台区大井附近，被阻拦的执行戒严任务的解放军某部队奉命转移。部队在同大学生达成协议后并在大学生帮助维持秩序的情况下开始转移。这时，一个身份不明的人制造谣言，进行煽动，混在学生和围观者中的一些不明身份的人用事先准备好的砖头瓦块袭击解放军战士。在这个过程中，大学生请求那些人不要再打了，但大学生也遭到了袭击。解放军保持了高度的克制，一边撤离，一边保护学生。在这一过程中，６０多名战士受伤，其中１７名住院治疗，４名受重伤，有的头部缝合９针，有的手指骨折。同时也有１１名大学生受轻伤，另外有１２人受轻伤、１人受重伤。在这一过程中有１０人被解放军战士扭送到公安机关，这些人已被拘留审查，其中有５名是外地人，有５名是北京市人，他们都不是大学生。２３日上午１１时，北京市常务副市长张百发、市政府秘书长铁英到医院看望了被打伤的解放军战士。
    在新闻发布会上还播映了事件发生后拍摄的录像。录像中有被砸坏的房舍、被砸碎的玻璃，房舍周围的地上布满了碎石块，还有几名被打伤的解放军战士。
    会上，丁维峻、叶上诗还回答了中外记者提出的问题。
