Canadian researchers have found that the global sea level is rising at an average rate of approximately 0.245 centimeters per year.

According to a report in the _Science_ magazine, scientists from the University of Toronto, based on measurements taken at 470 locations worldwide, have discovered that the sea level rise this century shows characteristics of climate warming.

Through advanced computer calculations, scientists have found that geographical differences have little impact on the rise in sea level.

In a detailed investigation of 40 selected locations, it was found that from 1920 to 1970, the global sea level rose at an average rate of approximately 0.294 centimeters per year.

　　加拿大科学家调查发现
    全球海平面上升
    新华社华盛顿５月２０日电  加拿大研究人员调查发现，世界海平面正以平均每年约０．２４５厘米的速度上升。
    据《科学杂志》报道，多伦多大学的科学家根据在全球４７０个地点测量的调查发现，本世纪海平面升高具有气候变暖引起的特征。
    科学家通过高级计算机计算的结果发现，地理差别对海平面升高影响不大。
    在选出的４０个地点的详细调查中发现，在１９２０—１９７０年间全球海平面平均每年上升约０．２９４厘米。
