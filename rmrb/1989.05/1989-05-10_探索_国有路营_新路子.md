	Exploring New Paths for "State-Owned, Road-Managed" Railways
	Yang Qihua, Director of Guangzhou Railway Bureau

	In the current situation where the state's financial resources are extremely limited, I believe that the key to accelerating railway construction lies in two main areas. First, we must persist in deepening internal railway reforms to enhance the vitality of railway enterprises. Second, we must strengthen cooperation between the central government and local governments, as well as between the railways and local areas, to mobilize funds from multiple channels for railway construction.

	Over the past decade of reform, our bureau has, through the establishment of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company, gradually explored a new path for railways to transition from "state-owned and state-managed" to "state-owned, road-managed." We have created an operating model for the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Company that emphasizes "independent management, self-accumulation, self-improvement, and self-development." Under this "four-self" operating model, the company has, through the form of increasing profits and a 50% increase in freight rates, accumulated its own funds in less than three years to complete the 147-kilometer Guangzhou-Shenzhen double-track railway one year ahead of schedule. This has basically transformed the Guangzhou-Shenzhen line from a constrained transport system to an adaptive one. Recently, our bureau has proposed an initial plan to promote the "Guangzhou-Shenzhen model" within the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, which has been endorsed by the governments of Guangdong and Hunan provinces and the Ministry of Railways. If this reform plan is approved and implemented by the state, it will undoubtedly deepen railway reforms and accelerate railway construction.

	To accelerate railway construction, in addition to state investment and increased accumulation from higher freight rates, we should also adopt methods such as issuing railway bonds to raise funds from society; encouraging local governments and enterprises to raise funds to jointly build railway freight yards and passenger facilities; attracting foreign and overseas Chinese investment to jointly establish development-oriented and regional railway holding companies; and welcoming overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan to donate funds for railway construction. Currently, Guangdong is taking steps to cooperate with the provincial government and railways to raise funds for the continuation of the Guangzhou-Maoming Railway, and to raise funds through shareholding to build the Guangzhou-Meixian-Shantou Railway, accelerating the construction of railways in Guangdong.

　　探索“国有路营”新路子
    广州铁路局局长  杨其华
    在当前国家财力十分困难的情况下，我认为加快铁路建设的出路主要有两条，一是要坚持深化铁路内部改革，增强铁路企业活力。二是要加强中央与地方，铁路与地方的合作，多渠道集资建路。
    我局在十年改革中，通过建立广深铁路公司的改革实践，逐步探索出铁路由“国有国营”转向“国有路营”的新路子，创造了“自主经营、自我积累、自我改造、自我发展”的广深铁路公司的经营模式。广深公司在“四自”经营方式下，以上缴利润递增包干的形式和提高运价５０％的政策，不到三年时间，依靠自身积累，提前一年修通了１４７公里广（州）深（圳）双线，基本实现了广深线的运输由限制型向适应型的转变。最近，我局提出在广州铁路局范围内推行“广深模式”的初步设想，得到了广东、湖南两省政府和铁道部的赞同。如果这一改革方案得到国家批准实施，必将深化铁路改革，加快铁路建设。
    加快铁路建设，除了国家倾斜投资，铁路在提高运价后增加的积累以外，还应采用发行铁路债券等方式，向社会集资；鼓励地方政府和企业自筹资金，合资修建铁路货场，客运设施；引进外资、侨资，合资办开发性和区域性的铁路股份公司；欢迎华侨和港澳台同胞捐资建路等等。目前，广东已着手由省政府与铁路合作，集资续建广（州）茂（名）铁路，以股份制方式集资筹建广（州）梅（县）汕（头）铁路，加快广东铁路建设。
