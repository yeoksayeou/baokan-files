Today in the early morning, CCP Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and Premier Li Peng, along with other leaders, visited Tiananmen Square to see the students on hunger strike. Zhao Ziyang took the megaphone handed to him by the students and made an important speech.

Zhao Ziyang said, "Comrades, we came too late. We are sorry. You criticize us, and it is justified. I am not here to ask for your forgiveness. I just want to say that your health is already very weak. You have been on a hunger strike for the seventh day, and this cannot continue. Prolonged hunger striking will cause irreparable harm to your bodies and is life-threatening. The most important thing now is to end this hunger strike as soon as possible. I know that you are hunger striking to demand that the Party and the government give satisfactory answers to the issues you have raised. I think our channels of dialogue are still open, and some issues need a process to be resolved. For example, the issues of nature and responsibility that you mentioned, I think these issues can eventually be resolved and a consensus can be reached. However, you should also know that the situation is very complex and needs a process. You cannot insist on getting a satisfactory answer before ending the hunger strike when it has already been seven days."

Zhao Ziyang earnestly said, "You are still young, and you have a long way to go. You should live healthily and see the day when China achieves the Four Modernizations. You are not like us; we are already old and it doesn't matter. The country and your parents have worked hard to send you to college! Now, at the age of ten or twenty, you are going to sacrifice your lives like this? Comrades, can you think rationally for a moment. The situation is already very serious, and you all know that the Party and the state are very anxious, and the whole society is worried. Moreover, Beijing is the capital, and the situation is getting worse day by day. This situation cannot continue, and comrades are all well-intentioned, for the good of our country, but if this situation continues and gets out of control, it will have serious consequences."

Zhao Ziyang said, "In short, this is my intention. If you stop the hunger strike, the government will not close the door to dialogue, absolutely not! The issues you raised, we can continue to discuss. It may be slow, but the understanding of some issues is gradually approaching. Today, I mainly came to visit the comrades and to express our feelings, hoping that the comrades can calmly think about this issue. This matter is difficult to think clearly in an irrational state. Everyone is so enthusiastic, young people, we have all been young, we have also protested and lain on the tracks, and we didn't think about what would happen later."

Zhao Ziyang finally earnestly requested the comrades to think calmly about the future. He said, "There are many things that can be solved. I hope you end the hunger strike soon, thank you comrades." At this point, Zhao Ziyang bowed to the comrades, and the comrades applauded warmly.

After Zhao Ziyang's speech, the students asked Zhao Ziyang to sign, and Zhao Ziyang agreed to their requests one by one.

　　赵紫阳李鹏昨晨到天安门广场看望绝食请愿的部分高校学生    
    赵总书记恳切希望同学们健康地活着看到中国实现四化
    本报北京５月１９日讯  今天凌晨，中共中央总书记赵紫阳、国务院总理李鹏等领导人到天安门广场看望绝食学生。赵紫阳接过学生递给他的扩音器，作了重要的讲话。
    赵紫阳说，同学们，我们来得太晚了，对不起同学们了。你们说我们、批评我们，都是应该的。我这次来不是请你们原谅。我想说的是，现在同学们身体已经非常虚弱，绝食已经到了第７天，不能再这样下去了。绝食时间长了，对身体会造成难以弥补的损害，这是有生命危险的。现在最重要的是，希望尽快结束这次绝食。我知道，你们绝食是希望党和政府对你们所提出的问题给以最满意的答复。我觉得，我们的对话渠道还是畅通的，有些问题需要一个过程才能解决。比如你们提到的性质、责任问题，我觉得这些问题终究可以得到解决，终究可以取得一致的看法。但是，你们也应该知道，情况是很复杂的，需要有一个过程。你们不能在绝食已进入第７天的情况下，还坚持一定要得到满意答复才停止绝食。
    赵紫阳恳切地说，你们还年轻，来日方长，你们应该健康地活着，看到我们中国实现四化的那一天。你们不像我们，我们已经老了，无所谓了。国家和你们的父母培养你们上大学不容易呀！现在十几、二十几岁，就这样把生命牺牲掉哇？！同学们能不能稍微理智地想一想。现在的情况已经非常严重，你们都知道，党和国家非常着急，整个社会都忧心如焚。另外，北京是首都，各方面情况一天天严重，这种情况不能再继续下去了，同学们都是好意，为了我们国家好，但是这种情况发展下去，失去控制，会造成各方面的严重影响。
    赵紫阳说，总之，我就是这么一个心意。如果你们停止绝食，政府不会因此把对话的门关起来，绝不会！你们所提的问题，我们可以继续讨论。慢是慢了一些，但一些问题的认识正在逐步接近。我今天主要是看望一下同学们，同时说一说我们的心情，希望同学们冷静地想一想这个问题。这件事情在不理智的情况下，是很难想清楚的。大家都这么一股劲，年轻人吆，我们都是从年轻人过来的，我们也游过行、卧过轨，当时根本不想以后怎么样。
    赵紫阳最后再次恳请同学们冷静地想一想今后的事。他说，有很多事情总是可以解决的。希望你们早些结束绝食，谢谢同学们。说到这里，赵紫阳同志向同学们鞠躬，同学们热烈鼓掌。
    赵紫阳讲话结束后，同学们纷纷请紫阳同志签字，紫阳一一满足了他们的要求。
