Since February of this year, the Leiyang and Shaodong Airports of the Air Force have suffered serious damage to their important flight facilities. From February 4 to 9, 48 night navigation lights at Leiyang Airport were stolen or smashed, and 280 meters of steel-core aluminum wire from the glide slope light frame were cut away. The direct economic loss amounted to 11,630 yuan. The ground service rest house and camp equipment were also stolen and damaged, totaling 21,460 yuan in value. In February and March, the first-level national defense communication lines from Shaodong Airport to Guangzhou, Changsha, and Leiyang were cut three times, with 1,100 meters of copper wire stolen. Additionally, the problem of illegal electricity usage is quite severe. There are 578 households in Shaodong Airport that have illegally connected lighting electricity. Many residents use electric stoves to boil water, cook, and prepare pig feed. When military personnel go to stop them, the residents mob and attack. We appeal to the local government to pay high attention to this issue, crack down on lawbreakers who damage military facilities, and ensure the safety of military facilities.

　　邵东耒阳机场连遭破坏  呼吁地方保护军用设施
    今年２月以来，空军耒阳机场和邵东机场的重要飞行设施，连续遭到严重破坏。２月４日至９日，耒阳机场的多种夜航灯被盗被砸４８盏，下滑灯架空钢芯铝绞线被剪走２８０米，直接经济损失１１６３０元；地勤休息室营房营具被盗、被损坏，折价２１４６０元。２、３月间，邵东机场通往广州、长沙、耒阳的一级国防通讯线连续３次被割，盗走铜线11００米。此外，强行偷电的现象也相当严重。邵东机场私搭照明电的群众就有５７８户，许多群众都用电炉烧水、做饭、煮猪食。部队人员去制止时，群众就一哄而上围攻。呼吁地方政府高度重视这一问题，打击破坏军事设施的不法分子，确保军事设施的安全。
