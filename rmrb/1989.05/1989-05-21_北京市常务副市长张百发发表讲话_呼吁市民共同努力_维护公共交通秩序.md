Beijing's Deputy Mayor Zhang Baifa today delivered a speech on Beijing Television, appealing to all citizens of Beijing to work together to ensure that the basic needs of the people are not greatly affected.

Zhang Baifa said that currently, Beijing is facing a critical shortage of coal gas and liquefied gas, and electric heating is also in short supply. The supply of major staple foods such as vegetables, milk, and eggs cannot be transported into the city, and garbage cannot be transported out. The key to solving all these problems is transportation. He called on all citizens of Beijing to maintain public transportation order and ensure the smooth operation of public bus routes.
