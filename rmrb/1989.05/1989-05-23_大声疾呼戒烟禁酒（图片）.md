    Loudly Advocating for Quitting Smoking and Alcohol
    A veteran worker from the Taihang Technical School in Changzhi, Shanxi Province, is deeply concerned about the harm that smoking and alcohol cause to humans. He rides a bicycle with a sign that reads "Quit Smoking and Alcohol, Protect the Next Generation" and wears a shirt that says "Smoking and Alcohol Are Harmful." He has been promoting this message in public places and streets for five years. Under his initiative, the Changzhi City Anti-Smoking Association was established, and he became a director, recruiting more than thirty members.

    大声疾呼戒烟禁酒
    山西长治市太行技校一老工人疾于烟酒对人类的危害。他推着竖有“戒烟禁酒，保护后代”标语的自行车，身穿写有“烟酒危害”的上衣，宣传于公共场所和大街小巷。这一做法他已坚持了五年。在他的倡议下，长治市成立了戒烟协会，他担任了理事，并发展三十多个会员。
