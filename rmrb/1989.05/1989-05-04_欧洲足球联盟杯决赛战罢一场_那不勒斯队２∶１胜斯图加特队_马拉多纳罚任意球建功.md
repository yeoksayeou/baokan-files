The first leg of the European Football Cup final was played tonight in the southern Italian city of Naples. The Italian team Napoli defeated the West German team Stuttgart 2-1.

In the first half, both teams started aggressively, showing no hesitation in challenging for the ball. At the 17th minute, Stuttgart's number 11, Gornik, scored the first goal from a free kick. Despite the roaring support from the home crowd, Napoli managed only 9 shots on goal in the first half, all of which were repelled by Stuttgart's solid defense.

In the second half, Napoli continued their strong play, taking 8 shots and earning 7 corner kicks in the first 20 minutes. At the 23rd minute, world-renowned player Diego Maradona, wearing the number 10 jersey, equalized the score with a free kick. 19 minutes later, Napoli's number 9, Careca, scored another goal.

Throughout the match, Napoli dominated, especially after falling behind early. Led by Maradona, they fought back with renewed vigor. In the entire match, Napoli had 22 shots on goal and 13 corner kicks, while Stuttgart managed only 8 shots and 3 corner kicks.

Approximately 90,000 spectators from Italy and abroad watched the match. Despite the 80,000-seat stadium being filled with 90,000 people, the order in the stands remained excellent throughout the game.

The second leg of the European Football Cup final will be held on May 17 in Stuttgart, West Germany.

    新华社罗马５月３日电（记者袁锦林）今晚在意大利南部大城市那不勒斯举行的欧洲足球联盟杯决赛第一场比赛中，意大利那不勒斯队以２∶１战胜西德斯图加特队。
    在上半时比赛中，双方队员一开始就敢于拚抢，毫不拘谨。比赛到第１７分钟时，斯图加特队的１１号运动员高迪诺利用罚任意球的机会首开纪录。上半时那不勒斯队在球迷们震耳欲聋的助威声中，虽有９次射门，但均未能突破斯图加特队坚如城墙般的防守。
    下半时开始后，那不勒斯队锐气不减，头２０分钟就有８次射门和７次角球。比赛进行到第２３分钟时，世界著名球星、１０号马拉多纳利用一次罚任意球的机会，将球送进球门，为那不勒斯队扳回一球。１９分钟后，那不勒斯队的９号运动员卡雷卡又踢进一球。
    从比赛情况看，那不勒斯队占有优势，尤其是先失一球后，毫不气馁，在马拉多纳的带领下，越战越勇。在全场比赛中，那不勒斯队共射门２２次，角球１３个；斯图加特队共射门８次，角球３个。
    来自意大利各地及外国的约９万名观众观看了这场比赛。尽管拥有８万个座位的球场进了９万人，但在整个比赛过程中，观众席上的秩序始终井然。
    双方争夺欧洲足球联盟杯的第二场比赛将于５月１７日在西德的斯图加特市举行。
