Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 4th.

Lech Walesa, the chairman of the Solidarity Trade Union, condemned the illegal demonstrations and parades that took place on May 1st in several Polish cities during a press conference held in Gdansk on May 4th.

According to the Polish News Agency, on May 1st, in cities such as Warsaw, Wroclaw, and Gdansk, in addition to the official organized celebrations and the "May Day" gatherings and parades organized by Solidarity with official permission, there were also illegal demonstrations and parades by a small number of individuals. Demonstrators clashed with the police, and a few troublemakers were detained by the authorities.

Walesa has repeatedly stated that he does not support such demonstrations. He said that while some laws are imperfect and need to be amended, this does not mean that everyone can do as they please.

Walesa acknowledged that there are currently divisions within Solidarity between those advocating for struggle and those advocating for work. However, he expressed his belief that after the upcoming national congress, Solidarity will "restore unity."

Walesa reiterated that he does not intend to participate in the presidential election. He only hopes to fulfill his duties properly.

　　瓦文萨谴责非法示威游行
    新华社华沙５月４日电  波兰团结工会主席瓦文萨４日在格但斯克举行的记者招待会上，严厉谴责５月１日在波兰一些城市所发生的非法示威游行。
    据波通社报道，５月１日，在华沙、弗罗茨瓦夫、格但斯克等城市，除了官方组织的庆祝活动，以及经官方允许由团结工会方面组织的“五一”集会和游行外，还出现了少数人的非法示威游行。示威者同警察发生了冲突，少数闹事者被警方拘留。
    瓦文萨曾多次表示，他不赞成这种示威游行。他说，有的法律不完善，应该加以修改，但这并不意味着每个人都可以为所欲为。
    瓦文萨承认，现在在团结工会中也出现了“主张斗争”和“主张工作”的分歧。但他表示相信，在即将召开的全国代表大会之后，团结工会将“恢复团结”。
    瓦文萨重申，他不准备参加总统竞选。他只希望好好完成他所承担的义务。
