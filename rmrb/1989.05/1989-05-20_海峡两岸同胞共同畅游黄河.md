Fellow countrymen from both sides of the Taiwan Strait enjoy swimming together in the Yellow River

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on May 18th, the swimming team organized by Mr. Wang Han, who is visiting relatives, and swimming enthusiasts from Jinan City swam across the Yellow River, the second-largest river in China, this afternoon.

In the afternoon, Mr. Wang Han and Chairman Wang Dexin of the Jinan City Swimming Association led the swimming enthusiasts from Taiwan and Jinan City to the northern suburbs of Jinan City, to the Yellow River embankment at Gaijia Gorge. At around 3 PM, the brave swimmers jumped into the water amidst the sound of firecrackers, forming a "V" shape, and swam across the Yellow River together.

The May sun shone brightly on the 400-meter-wide river surface, making it gleam with golden light. The 19 fellow countrymen and women encouraged each other, striking the water and moving forward. Ten minutes later, they overcame the strong currents and successfully swam to the opposite bank.

Wang Han, who is 35 years old, has loved swimming since his childhood, especially swimming in rivers, lakes, and seas. He hopes to organize swimming enthusiasts from both sides of the Taiwan Strait next year to create a swimming record for Chinese people on the international stage.

　　海峡两岸同胞共同畅游黄河
    据新华社济南５月１８日电  （记者袁文忠）由王瀚先生组织的台湾泳渡探亲团的泳渡勇士和济南市的泳渡爱好者今天下午共渡了祖国第二大河——黄河。
    下午，王瀚先生和济南市游泳协会主席王德馨先后带领台湾和济南市的泳渡健儿来到济南市北郊盖家沟的黄河大堤上。３时许，勇士们在鞭炮声中跃身入水，呈“人”字排开，共渡黄河。
    ５月的骄阳把４００多米的河面照得金光灿灿。１９名同胞姐妹兄弟相互鼓舞着，击水前进。１０分钟后，他们战胜激流，顺利游渡到对岸。
    ３５岁的王瀚幼年时期就喜爱游泳，特别是到江河湖海里击浪畅游。他希望明年组织海峡两岸的游泳健儿，到国际上创造中国人的海泳纪录。
