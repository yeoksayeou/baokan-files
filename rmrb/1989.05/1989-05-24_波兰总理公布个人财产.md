　　波兰总理公布个人财产
    新华社华沙５月２３日电  （记者董福生）波兰总理拉科夫斯基２３日在皮瓦省以议员身份同选民见面时，应选民要求，当众公布了自己的工资收入和家庭财产状况。
    他说，从今年２月起，他的月收入为４０．４万兹罗提，按规定交纳４．３万兹罗提的所得税，还剩３６．１万兹罗提。这在波兰并不是最高工资。据了解，许多工人，如井下矿工月收入可达６０万至７０万兹罗提。
    他说，他作为总理享有的特权是，有两部公车可供使用，此外家里的电话也免费使用。至于家里的收音机、电视机以及住房都要照章纳税和交费。
    他说，他住的是单元楼中的１套４居室住房，使用面积总共为１１６平方米。
    他在谈到财产时说，他有一笔存款，主要是当年作记者时存下的。由于利率不断提高，目前连本带息总共为３７０万兹罗提，还有一辆本国产的“波罗涅兹”牌私人轿车。此外，在玛祖尔地区拥有一座２１年前建造的私人别墅式小房。
    拉科夫斯基最后说，“这就是我的全部财产，我的一切都是公开的，没有任何东西需要隐瞒。”
    他的讲话博得全场听众的热烈掌声。
