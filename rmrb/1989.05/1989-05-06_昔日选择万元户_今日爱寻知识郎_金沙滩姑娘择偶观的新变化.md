The marriage preferences of young people in Jinsha Beach Town, Huairen County, Shanxi Province, have undergone new changes. Young women increasingly favor men with knowledge and skills.

In the past, if a girl could marry a "millionaire," she would be the envy of her peers. Today, however, girls believe that young men with education and knowledge are the true "wealthy" ones. Someone introduced a young man from a millionaire family to Han Weifang, who had graduated from junior high school. The first gift the young man sent through an intermediary was 1,500 yuan. When Han Weifang learned that the young man did not like to study and often wandered around, she rejected the match. Later, Xiao Han got engaged to Ju San, a skilled farmer from a neighboring village.

Now, young men in Jinsha Beach Town who do not like to study feel they can no longer get by. They are all eager to learn knowledge and culture, hoping to soon win the favor of the girls.

　　昔日选择万元户　今日爱寻知识郎    
    金沙滩姑娘择偶观的新变化
    本报讯  山西省怀仁县金沙滩镇青年择偶标准发生了新的转变，有知识有技术的男青年日益受到姑娘们的青睐。
    以前，谁家姑娘能找上一个“万元户”，便是众多姐妹中的佼佼者，而今，姑娘们认为，有文化、有知识的青年才是真正的“富有者”。有人给初中毕业的青年韩卫花介绍的男友家是个万元户，男方第一次托人拿来的见面礼便是１５００元。当韩卫花得知男青年不爱学习，经常东游西窜时，拒绝了这门亲事。后来，小韩与邻村的种田能手句三订下了终身。
    现在，金沙滩镇那些不爱学习的青年也感到自己无法再混下去了，他们纷纷学知识、学文化，希望能早日得到姑娘们抛出的红绣球。
