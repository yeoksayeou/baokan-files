	Hu Qili Meets with Bulgarian Guests, Says Building Socialist Democratic Politics is a Gradual Process

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 2 (reporter Zhou Cinuo) — Today in the afternoon, Hu Qili, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, said: "Building socialist democratic politics is our goal, but it is a gradual process of accumulation."

	During a talk with a delegation from the Bulgarian Communist Party led by Politburo member M. Balayev, Hu Qili pointed out that the construction of democratic politics must be synchronized with China's economic development, neither too fast nor too slow.

	He said: "At present, our overriding task is to maintain political stability. Of course, stability does not mean silencing people. Only by truly promoting socialist democracy can we maintain stability. However, if the political situation is unstable, even the achievements we have made will be lost."

	Hu Qili introduced to the Bulgarian guests the situation regarding China's efforts to rectify the economic environment, streamline economic order, and deepen reforms. He said, "While rectifying and streamlining, we must also complete three tasks: first, adjust the economic structure and improve economic efficiency; second, further improve the operating mechanism of enterprises; third, strengthen and improve the central government's macro-control capabilities."

	Balayev also introduced the achievements of Bulgaria's socialist construction and the current situation of reforms in Bulgaria. He said, Bulgaria's goal is to achieve a high level of development in all aspects of society, form new productive forces based on the technological revolution, improve the living standards of the people, unleash individual vitality and capabilities, expand and perfect socialist democracy, and play a greater role in maintaining peace and promoting détente.

	Hu Qili and Balayev also discussed the issue of further developing relations between the two parties and the two countries.

	During the talk, Balayev presented Hu Qili with a Bulgarian edition of Deng Xiaoping's Selected Works, "On Fundamental Issues in Contemporary China." Hu Qili also presented Balayev with a Chinese edition of "Selected Works of Zhivkov."

　　胡启立会见保加利亚客人时说    
    建设民主政治是渐进过程
    据新华社北京５月２日电  （记者周慈朴）中共中央政治局常委胡启立今天下午在这里说：“建设社会主义民主政治，是我们的目标，但它是一个逐步积累的渐进过程。”
    在同由中央政治局委员米·巴列夫率领的保加利亚共产党代表团会谈时，胡启立指出，民主政治的建设要同中国的经济发展同步进行，既不能超前，也不能滞后。
    他说：“当前我们压倒一切的任务是保持政局的稳定。当然稳定不是不让人说话。只有真正发扬社会主义民主才能保持稳定。可是，倘若政局不稳，甚至连已经取得的成就也会丧失。”
    胡启立向保加利亚客人介绍了中国治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序和深化改革的情况。他说，在治理整顿的同时，我们还要完成三项任务：一，调整经济结构，提高经济效益；二，进一步完善企业的经营机制；三，加强和改进中央的宏观调控能力。
    巴列夫在会谈中也介绍了保加利亚社会主义建设所取得的成就和保加利亚当前进行改革的情况。他说，保加利亚的目标是使社会的发展在各方面达到高度水平，在科技革命的基础上形成新的生产力，提高人民的生活水平，发挥个人的活力和能力，扩大和完善社会主义的民主，以及在维护和平、促进缓和方面发挥更大的作用。
    胡启立和巴列夫还谈到了进一步发展中保两党和两国关系的问题。
    会谈时，巴列夫向胡启立赠送了保加利亚出版的邓小平文选《论当代中国的基本问题》。胡启立也向巴列夫赠送了中国出版的《日夫科夫文选》。
