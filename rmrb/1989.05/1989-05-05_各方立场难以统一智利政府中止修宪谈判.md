	Various Stances Make Unification Difficult
	Chilean Government Suspends Constitutional Amendment Negotiations

	Buenos Aires, May 4 (Xinhua) — Santiago, May 4 (Xinhua) — After the opposition parties rejected the government's proposed constitutional amendments, the Chilean government decided to suspend negotiations on the constitutional amendment plan.

	Interior Minister Caress yesterday afternoon announced that under the current national situation and political landscape, there is no possibility of resuming discussions on the constitutional amendment plan.

	In mid-March of this year, the government formally agreed to make certain amendments to the constitution and began negotiations with various political parties. The opposition alliance, composed of 17 parties, proposed a 33-point plan. On April 28, the government side proposed a 19-point constitutional amendment proposal. The government's plan partially accepted the opposition's demands, mainly including: reducing the presidential term from 8 years to 4 years; removing the clause prohibiting Marxist ideology and Marxist parties; abolishing the president's power to exile citizens or prohibit them from returning to the country; and changing the structure of the powerful National Security Council, which is mainly composed of military personnel. The opposition alliance believed that the government's plan was extremely flawed and even a step backward. The focus of the disagreement was: the opposition demanded the removal of the provision that the current commanders of the three armed forces must serve at least 4 years after the election, an increase in the number of seats in the two chambers of parliament, and all members of parliament to be elected (the current constitution stipulates that General Pinochet can appoint 10 senators, and he himself is a senator for life), and to relax the restrictions on the parliament's constitutional amendment functions. These points were all rejected by the government. General Pinochet recently stated that, given the current national situation, the position of Army Commander-in-Chief is the best position for him to serve the country.

	Chile will hold simultaneous presidential and parliamentary elections on December 14 of this year. The opposition's strategy is to seek the maximum possible amendments to the current constitution before the election, in order to pave the way for fundamental amendments to the constitution after the election. The constitutional amendment issue involves the fundamental interests of various political forces in Chile and relates to the distribution of power in the future national system. Various parties have difficulty unifying their positions.

### 各方立场难以统一智利政府中止修宪谈判

　　各方立场难以统一   
    智利政府中止修宪谈判
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯５月４日电  记者李志明报道：圣地亚哥消息：在反对党拒绝了政府方面提出的修改宪法方案之后，智利政府决定中止就修宪方案进行的谈判。
    内政部长卡塞雷斯昨天下午宣布，在国家目前的形势和政治格局下，不存在任何可能重新讨论修宪方案。
    今年３月中旬，政府正式表示同意对宪法作某些修改，并开始与各政党进行谈判。由１７个政党组成的反对党联盟提出了一项３３点方案。４月２8日，政府方面提出一项１９点修宪建议。政府方案部分接受了反对党的要求，主要有：总统任期从８年缩短为４年；取消禁止马克思主义意识形态和马克思主义政党的条款；取消总统放逐公民或禁止他们回国的权力；改变权力很大的主要由军人组成的国家安全委员会的机构。反对党联盟认为，政府方案极不完善，甚至是倒退。双方分歧的焦点是：反对党要求取消关于现任三军总司令大选后至少留任４年的规定，增加议会二院的名额，所有议员都由选举产生（现行宪法规定皮诺切特将军可指定１０名参议员，他本人则为终身参议员），放宽对议会修改宪法职能的限制。这几条均被政府拒绝。皮诺切特将军几天前曾表示，鉴于国家目前的形势，陆军总司令的职务是我能够最好地为祖国效力的位置。
    今年１２月１４日智利将同时举行总统和议会选举。反对党的战略是选举前争取对现行宪法作最大可能的修改，以便为选举后对宪法作根本修改开辟道路。修宪问题涉及到智利各派政治力量的根本利益，关系到未来国家体制中的权力分配，各方立场难以统一。
