More than a hundred fishing boats from Yilan County's Nanfangao in Taiwan escorted the statue of the sea goddess Mazu back to her ancestral temple in Meizhou Bay, Fujian on May 5.

Despite the Taiwanese police's attempt to dissuade the fishermen from entering the mainland, they did not "specifically obstruct" them. The Yilan County "Court" believed that the fishermen's actions violated the "National Security Law," while the county "Police Bureau" thought that since the fishermen's paperwork was in order, there was no reason to prevent them from going to sea.

　　台湾百船渔民送妈祖像回闽
    新华社香港５月６日电  据台湾报纸报道，台湾宜兰县南方澳百余艘渔船５月５日护送海上女神妈祖像回福建湄洲湾祖庙。
    尽管台湾警方曾派人劝导渔民不要进入大陆，但并未“特别阻拦”。宜兰县“法院”认为，渔民的行为已违反“国安法”，而县“警察局”则认为，渔民出海手续完备，没有理由不准其出海。
