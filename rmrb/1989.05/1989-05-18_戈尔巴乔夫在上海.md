Gorbachev in Shanghai

By Zhang Yunwen, Correspondent

Gorbachev spent only a brief five hours in Shanghai, China's largest city, but his schedule was as packed as his talks in Beijing.

The Soviet dignitary met with Shanghai's municipal leaders as soon as he stepped off the plane and attended a luncheon hosted by the mayor. He then proceeded directly to the Pushkin Memorial, dedicated to the 19th-century Russian poet, in the Xuhui District of Shanghai to lay flowers. Subsequently, he rushed to the Minhang Economic Development Zone upstream on the Huangpu River for a tour.

Gorbachev and his entourage were warmly welcomed by the citizens of Shanghai. The Pushkin Memorial was initially built in February 1937 and reconstructed in 1987. A large crowd had already gathered to welcome the Soviet dignitary. As Gorbachev's motorcade approached, the crowd erupted in applause and cheers. Gorbachev and his wife Raisa were moved by the spontaneous enthusiasm of the crowd. After laying the flowers, Gorbachev addressed the crowd. He said, "When we prepared for this visit, we thought of many things. Now the visit has been successfully completed, and I congratulate you. I also congratulate the Soviet people." Gorbachev added, "When we planned this visit, I said we must visit Shanghai." He said he knew more about Shanghai than Beijing. Gorbachev excitedly said, "The important talks have been concluded, and now we need to take big steps forward." He said, "Thank you for your hospitality. We will continue to move forward." His brief speech was repeatedly interrupted by the applause of the citizens.

At the Minhang Economic Development Zone, Gorbachev listened with great interest to the host's explanations about joint ventures with foreign companies and the introduction of technology. He asked one question after another, such as how to attract foreign investment, how to transfer technology, how to earn foreign exchange, whether products can be exported, and whether short-term goals can be achieved. He said, "Please forgive my curiosity, but I really want to know a lot of things. I have one last question: what is the difference in average income between the workers in the development zone and the ordinary workers in Shanghai?" When he heard that it was twice the income of state-owned enterprise employees, and that the production efficiency was 7-8 times that of state-owned enterprises, he humorously said, "That's good, but you haven't paid the workers enough!"

During his visit to the Shanghai Mitsubishi Electric Co., Ltd., a joint venture between China and Japan, Gorbachev often stopped to chat with the workers. He asked a worker about his monthly income. The worker replied 300 yuan. He then asked about the female workers' wages. The answer was equal pay for equal work. The Soviet guest smiled. When chatting with another young worker, he even asked about his marital status.

Although his visit to Shanghai was brief, Gorbachev was very satisfied with the tight schedule and rich content, and the warm welcome from the citizens.

　　戈尔巴乔夫在上海
    本报记者  张允文
    戈尔巴乔夫主席在中国最大城市上海只逗留了短暂的五个多小时，但其活动日程的紧张程度并不亚于在北京的会谈。
    苏联贵宾一下飞机就会见了上海市领导人并出席了市长的午宴。随后即直奔位于上海徐汇区的１９世纪俄罗斯伟大诗人普希金纪念碑献花。接着又赶往黄浦江上游闵行经济开发区参观。
    戈尔巴乔夫主席一行在上海受到市民们的热情欢迎。普希金纪念碑初建于１９３７年２月，于１９８７年重建。这里早已聚集了大批迎候苏联贵宾的市民。当戈尔巴乔夫一行的车队驰近时，四周群众爆发出掌声和欢呼声。戈尔巴乔夫主席和夫人赖莎为群众的自发热情所感动，献完花以后，戈尔巴乔夫向群众讲了话。他说，当我们准备这次访问时，我们想了很多。现在访问已顺利结束，我向你们祝贺。我也祝贺苏联人民。戈尔巴乔夫又说，当我们计划这次访问时，我就说过，我们一定要访问上海。他说，他对上海的了解多于北京。戈尔巴乔夫兴奋地说，重要的会谈已经结束，现在要迈大步前进。他说，谢谢你们的接待。我们将继续往前走。他的简短讲话不断被市民的掌声所打断。
    在闵行经济开发区，戈尔巴乔夫饶有兴趣地听取了主人关于中外合资、引进技术的介绍，并提出了一个又一个问题。如，如何吸收外资、如何转让技术、如何创汇、能否实现产品外销、能否实现短期的目标等等。他说，请原谅我的好奇心，我确实想知道很多事情。我还要提最后一个问题，即开发区工人平均收入同上海普通工人的收入差距有多大？当他听说等于国营企业职工收入的两倍，而生产效率是国营企业的７—８倍时，风趣地说，这很好，但你们没有付足职工的工资啊！
    在开发区的中日合资企业上海三菱电器有限公司参观时，戈尔巴乔夫不时地停下来同工人交谈。他问一名工人的月收入多少。工人说３００元人民币。又问女工工资多少？回答是同工同酬。苏联客人笑了。与另一位青工交谈时，还问到他的婚姻情况。
    在上海的访问时间虽然短暂，但戈尔巴乔夫主席对安排紧凑，内容丰富，受到市民们的热情欢迎感到十分满意。
