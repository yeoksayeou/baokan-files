The East Bridge of Youtou Town is located in Datian County, nestled at the foot of the Daiyun Mountains. It is situated right in the heart of Fujian Province, surrounded by mountains and winding paths, far from any railway lines, earning it the nickname "the mountain within the mountains." Despite this, the bridge, constructed in the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong era (1752), is the largest and longest ancient bridge in the region. It was once part of the "Eight Scenic Views," known as "East Stream Rainbow Reflection," and is now listed as one of the top ten cultural relics in Sanming.

The bridge is built with granite and has six piers, each extending outward in a pointed, boat-like shape, reminiscent of ancient architecture. What draws the eye is its unique construction. Unlike typical arch bridges, it features five interconnected arches, with the top of the bridge following the curve of the arches, giving it a wave-like appearance. In the early morning and evening, the water and mountains reflect off the bridge, creating a sense of movement and solemn beauty.

The bridge is 8.5 zhang high, 22 zhang long, and 1.5 zhang wide, with intricately carved stone railings. Both the north and south ends of the bridge have platforms extending outward like the wings of a great bird, enhancing the bridge's grandeur. On the south platform stands a large stone tablet with the characters "East Bridge of Youtou Town" inscribed in a flowing script. On the north platform, six large stone tablets are inscribed with the "Bridge Record," attracting many visitors. Walking across the bridge, one finds that the north end has two sets of stone steps, each with 9 steps, while the south end has 19 and 7 steps. Between each set of steps is a flat area, with the longest at the top of the bridge measuring 7.1 zhang. Stone lions stand guard at the ends of the railings, like diligent and spirited protectors.

"Boats on Dongting Lake and sails on Xianxiang, travelers from Wu and Chu journey together." In ancient times, this was a major transportation hub, with a constant stream of travelers. The East Bridge connected the land routes to Dehua and Yongchun, and the waterways of Junxi, where merchant ships traveled like shuttles, and sails could reach Nanping and Fuzhou. Time has passed, and the landscape has changed. The waters of Junxi have receded, and water transport has been replaced by automobile transport. Not far away, a concrete and steel bridge stands tall. However, people still cherish the historical value and tourist appeal of the East Bridge of Youtou Town. In recent years, it has been restored at great expense. Although the half-street on the west bank has been widened into a broad avenue with shops lining both sides, the ancient charm of the mountain area remains, and the local customs are simple and honest. Especially when lingering by the bridge, you might feel the poetic sentiment of "Small stream water enters the Great Bridge of Datian, both banks windy with willows swaying. Divine blessings spread among the people, often hearing the night flute of the fairy."

　　悠悠镇东桥
    苏勤华
    戴云山麓的大田县，不偏不倚，正处于福建省中心地段，丛山环绕，山路岌岌，又远离铁路线，被称为山区里的山区。然而，这里的清乾隆十七年（１７５２）筑成的镇东桥，却是全地区最大最长的古桥，“潭上几湾浮半月，天边千尺落长虹”，古为八景中的“东溪虹影”，今列为三明十大文物之一。
    花岗石砌就的六个桥墩，桥基座向左右伸出，呈尖尖船型，宛然古风。引人瞩目的是它的造桥艺术。它的线条与常见的拱桥不同，不是单一弧线，五孔连环拱，而桥上端也随拱洞的弧线走向起伏，整个形状像五个弧相连，又犹如水波的曲线。早霞和暮霭中，水映山衬，颤颤巍巍，古桥生发动感和一种肃穆之美。
    桥高８．５丈，长２２丈，宽１．５丈，石扶栏雕刻精美。南北桥头各筑有月台，延伸若大鹏的两翼，更显镇东桥的恢宏壮观。南月台竖起的大石碑，刻“镇东桥”三个潇洒飘逸的大字。北月台六块大石碑，铭刻阴文《桥记》，也颇吸引游客。漫步桥上，北端石阶两段，各为９级，南端石阶分别是１９级和７级。每段石阶之间均有一块平埕，桥顶中央平埕最长达７．１丈，扶栏的柱头还有石狮雄峙，宛如尽职尽责神采奕奕的守护神。
    “洞庭之楫潇湘篷，吴侬楚旅行相从。”古时这里是南来北往的交通枢纽，行人络绎不绝，镇东桥陆路可通德化、永春，均溪水路的商船如梭，风帆可直达南平、福州。星移斗转，沧桑变换，均溪水浅了，水运早被汽车运输取代，不远处还耸起钢筋水泥桥。然而，人们还是珍惜镇东桥的历史价值和旅游效应，近年耗资修复一次，尽管桥西岸的半边街也变成宽敞的大道，商店毗邻，但山区古风依存，民情淳厚，尤其流连桥畔，也许你会从人们安居乐业的氛围中，感发古诗中“小田水入大田桥，两岸风生柳拂条。圣化诞敷民俗美，时闻瀛女夜吹箫”的诗意。
