For the execution of President Bush's order, the first batch of 25 U.S. Marine Corps personnel arrived at the U.S. Howard Air Force Base in the Panama Canal Zone by U.S. Air Force aircraft at noon on the 12th.

An official from the U.S. Southern Command based in the Panama Canal Zone pointed out that starting from noon on the 12th, every half hour, a U.S. Air Force aircraft would transport combat personnel and military equipment to the Howard Air Force Base.

The official said that 70 U.S. military aircraft would transport 1,881 combat personnel to the U.S. military base in the Canal Zone.

The first 25 U.S. Marine Corps members who arrived in Panama came from the 7th Light Infantry Division stationed in Fort Ord, California. Ten U.S. journalists also arrived on the same flight.

Currently, the Panamanian government has not made any statement regarding the arrival of U.S. combat personnel. However, a high-ranking Panamanian military official revealed that the Panamanian Defense Forces are on "high alert."

Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Mexico City on the 12th: According to Mexico City Television, by tonight, 1,900 U.S. troops and a large amount of military equipment have arrived in the Panama Canal Zone.

President Bush announced yesterday that 2,000 more U.S. troops would be sent to Panama to "protect Americans in Panama." With the 13,000 military personnel already in the U.S. Southern Command, the total number of U.S. troops in the Canal Zone will reach 15,000.

After the reinforcements arrived, the U.S. troops in the Canal Zone lifted the C-level alert.

According to reports, the Panamanian side has not taken any special measures due to the arrival of U.S. reinforcement troops, and there will be no fighting between the U.S. and Panamanian troops for the time being.

Meanwhile, the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States unanimously agreed today to hold a meeting of foreign ministers in Washington on the 17th to discuss the situation in Panama. Countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Chile, and Venezuela expressed their opposition to U.S. military intervention in Panama. Leaders of various political parties and the parliament in Mexico also condemned U.S. interference in Panama's internal affairs.

It is reported that some British parliamentarians have asked Mrs. Thatcher to use her influence to persuade Bush to adopt a restrained attitude in Panama. The Soviet Union today condemned U.S. interference in Panama's internal affairs and called for allowing the Panamanian people to resolve the dispute on their own.

The focus of the Panama crisis, Noriega, has not appeared in public since the election. The opposition presidential candidate Endara and his running mate for vice president, who were injured in the bloody conflict on Wednesday, are still receiving treatment in the hospital. There are reports that the opposition will launch an indefinite general strike, demanding that the authorities respect the election results won by the opposition.

　　１９００增援美军抵巴拿马运河区
    新华社巴拿马城５月１２日电  为执行布什总统的命令，第一批２５名美国海军陆战队官兵１２日中午乘坐美国空军飞机抵达位于巴拿马运河区的美国霍华德空军基地。
    设在巴拿马运河区的美国南方司令部一位官员指出，从１２日中午起，在未来的３６小时内，每隔半小时就有一架美国空军飞机运载战斗人员和军事装备飞抵霍华德空军基地。
    这位军官说，将有７０架美国军用飞机运载１８８１名战斗人员到达设在运河区的美国军事基地。
    第一批抵达巴拿马的２５名美国海军陆战队成员来自驻美国加利福尼亚奥特堡第７轻步兵团。同机抵达的还有１０名美国记者。
    目前，巴拿马政府尚未对美国战斗人员抵达发表任何声明。但据巴拿马一位高级军方人士透露，巴拿马国防军已处于“最高级戒备”。　
    本报墨西哥城５月１２日电  记者郭伟成报道：据墨西哥城电视台报道：到今天晚间为止，已有１９００名美军与大批军事装备运抵巴拿马运河区。
    布什总统昨天曾宣布将增派２０００美军前往巴拿马“保护在巴拿马的美国人”。加上美国南方军总部拥有的１３０００名军事人员，运河区美军总数将达１５０００人。
    援军到达以后，运河区美军撤销了Ｃ级戒备。
    据报道，巴拿马方面并没有因为美军增援部队到达而采取特别措施，目前不会发生美巴两军的交战。
    与此同时，美洲国家组织常设理事会今天一致同意，１７日在华盛顿召开该组织的外长级会议，讨论巴拿马的局势。阿根廷，巴西、尼加拉瓜、哥斯达黎加、智利、委内瑞拉等拉美国家表示将反对美国对巴拿马的军事干涉。墨西哥各政党与议会领导人也谴责美国对巴拿马内部事务的干涉。
    据悉，一些英国议员要求撒切尔夫人利用她的影响，劝说布什在巴拿马采取克制的态度。苏联今天谴责美国干涉巴拿马内部事务，要求让巴拿马人自主解决争端。
    巴拿马危机的焦点人物诺列加自从大选以来一直没有在公众场合露面。巴拿马反对派总统候选人恩达拉与他的副总统竞选伙伴在星期三流血冲突中负伤以后，仍然在医院里接受治疗。有消息说，反对派将发起一次不定期的总罢工，要求当局尊重反对派获胜的大选结果。
