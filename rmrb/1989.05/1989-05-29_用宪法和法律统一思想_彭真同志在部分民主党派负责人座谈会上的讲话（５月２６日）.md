Today, I am here on behalf of the Central Committee to discuss some issues with a few old comrades, old friends, and old colleagues.

The motive behind the recent student protests is good, pure, benevolent, and constructive. Their goal is to address shortcomings and mistakes in our work, to make the country's affairs and the socialist cause better. This aligns with our objectives. However, the methods and means they adopted are not quite appropriate. This is not the students' fault. Firstly, they are not familiar with the laws or are only partially familiar. Secondly, they lack political experience and are not sufficiently vigilant against the few conspirators and troublemakers who are taking advantage of the situation to create chaos. We, the older comrades, have a responsibility to help them and remind them. Otherwise, we would be letting the students down.

Currently, thoughts are quite chaotic, with various slogans, views, proposals, and manifestos. The issues are prolonged without resolution. How can we unify our thoughts? We have the Constitution and laws, and we should and must use facts as the basis and the Constitution and laws as the standard to unify our thoughts. We cannot repeat the "Cultural Revolution" where there was no law and order. Have we not suffered enough? Do we want the disasters to repeat? I am not advocating punishing innocent students and other good people; there is no question of punishing them. As for the few conspirators and troublemakers, that is another matter. The People's Liberation Army is not here to deal with the students.

To unify our thoughts, I will discuss some relevant constitutional and legal provisions.

Firstly, Article 1 of the Constitution stipulates that the People's Republic of China is led by the working class, not the bourgeoisie, and certainly not jointly led by the working class and the bourgeoisie. It is based on the alliance of workers and peasants, not on any other class or stratum. It is a people's democratic dictatorship, not a bourgeois dictatorship, and certainly not a dictatorship of the landlord class. It is a socialist state, not a capitalist state. Engaging in bourgeois liberalization in our country is unconstitutional and goes against the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities and the Party's stance. The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Twelfth Central Committee clearly states: "Promoting bourgeois liberalization, which means negating the socialist system and advocating the capitalist system, is fundamentally against the interests of the people and the historical trend, and is firmly opposed by the broad masses of the people." Unifying thoughts starts with this principle. If this issue is not resolved, thoughts cannot be unified, and problems cannot be solved. The issue also arises within the Party.

Secondly, has there been turmoil in the capital over the past month or so? Yes, there has. Looking at the facts and the law makes it clear. Article 35 of the Constitution states that citizens have the freedom to parade and demonstrate. Legal parades and demonstrations are not turmoil. However, there is another provision. Article 51 of the Constitution states that when citizens exercise their freedoms and rights, they must not harm the interests of the state, society, collectives, or the lawful freedoms and rights of other citizens. Articles 2, 158, and 159 of the Criminal Law prohibit anyone from using any means to disrupt social order, production order, work order, teaching and research order, and the order of people's lives. Now, the situation is such that even state activities cannot proceed normally, and the ceremony and reception for welcoming Gorbachev cannot proceed normally. Even walking and commuting have become problems. What order is left in the capital? How can it be said that there is no harm to the interests of the state and society? Is this not turmoil? If we acknowledge that this action is not turmoil, it is equivalent to encouraging all parts of the country to create chaos like Beijing. How can we carry out reforms, opening up, and socialist modernization construction? However, we must strictly distinguish between the few conspirators and troublemakers and the students and other good people with pure motives.

Thirdly, is the decision by the State Council to impose martial law in parts of the capital legal? Some say that the State Council does not have this power and that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should revoke the martial law order issued by the State Council. Here, some people are either not familiar with the Constitution or have misunderstandings, while others have ulterior motives. Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution stipulates that the State Council has the power to decide on martial law in parts of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Beijing's total area is over 16,000 to 17,000 square kilometers, and the area under martial law is only about a thousand square kilometers. To maintain the dignity of the Constitution, to maintain the social order, production order, work order, teaching and research order, and the order of people's lives in the capital, the State Council's decision to impose martial law in parts of the capital is completely legal, necessary, and correct. Article 67, Item 7 of the Constitution stipulates that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has the power to revoke administrative regulations, decisions, and orders issued by the State Council that are in conflict with the Constitution and laws. Please note that this refers to conflicts with the Constitution and laws, not anything else. The martial law order issued by the State Council is completely in accordance with the Constitution and laws and does not conflict with the Constitution and laws in any way. How can the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress not support it?

Fourthly, all organizations and individuals must abide by the Constitution and laws. The Constitution stipulates that "all nationalities, all state organs and armed forces, all political parties and social organizations, all enterprises and institutions in the country must take the Constitution as the basic norm for their activities," "must abide by the Constitution and laws," "all acts in violation of the Constitution and laws must be investigated," and "no organization or individual shall have the privilege to be above the Constitution and laws." The Communist Party of China also clearly stipulates in its Constitution that "the Party must act within the scope of the Constitution and laws." State organs, including the State Council and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress; political parties, including the Communist Party and various democratic parties; individuals, including ordinary citizens and leaders of the Party and the state. Before the law, everyone is equal, and everyone must act within the scope of the Constitution and laws, and no one has the privilege to be above the Constitution and laws. Some people talk about the rule of law but in reality, not only do they trample on the Constitution and laws themselves, but they also incite others to violate the Constitution and laws. Please be vigilant, students and people from all walks of life.

　　用宪法和法律统一思想
    ——彭真同志在部分民主党派负责人座谈会上的讲话（５月２６日）
    今天，我受中央委托，请几位老战友、老同志、老朋友谈一谈，通通气。
    这次学生游行的动机是好的、纯洁的、善良的、建设性的，目的是为了克服工作中的缺点失误，把国家的事情、社会主义事业办得更好，这同我们的要求是一致的。但是，他们所采取的手段、方式不大妥当。这不怪孩子们。一是他们对法律不熟悉或不很熟悉。二是他们缺乏政治经验，对极少数极少数阴谋家、坏人乘机制造动乱的险恶用心，警惕不够。我们这些老同志有责任帮助他们，提醒他们。否则就对不起孩子们。
    现在思想比较乱，有各式各样的口号，各式各样的看法、主张，各式各样的纲领等等，问题旷日持久得不到解决。思想怎么统一？我们有宪法和法律，应该也必须以事实为根据，以宪法和法律为准绳来统一思想。不能再像“文化大革命”那样“和尚打伞、无法无天”了。难道苦头还没有吃够吗？还要让灾难重演吗？我这样说，决不是主张惩办无辜的学生和其他善良的人们，对他们不存在进行制裁的问题。至于对极少数极少数阴谋家、坏人，另当别论。解放军决不是来对付学生的。
    为了统一思想，我讲讲有关的宪法和法律规定。
    一、宪法第一条规定，中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的，不是资产阶级领导的，也不是工人阶级和资产阶级共同领导平分天下；是以工农联盟为基础的，不是以别的什么阶级、阶层为基础的；是人民民主专政，不是资产阶级专政，更不是地主阶级专政；是社会主义国家，不是资本主义国家。在我国搞资产阶级自由化的行动，是违宪的，也是违背全国各族人民根本利益和党的主张的。党的十二届六中全会决议明确指出：“搞资产阶级自由化，即否定社会主义制度，主张资本主义制度，是根本违背人民利益和历史潮流，为广大人民所坚决反对的。”统一思想，这是总纲。这一条不解决，思想不可能统一，问题无法解决。党内的问题也是发生在这里。
    二、最近一个多月来首都是不是发生了动乱？是。看看事实和法律就清楚了。宪法第三十五条规定，公民有游行、示威的自由。合法的游行示威不是动乱。但是，还有一条。宪法第五十一条规定，公民行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。刑法第二条、第一百五十八条、第一百五十九条规定了禁止任何人利用任何手段扰乱社会秩序、生产秩序、工作秩序、教学科研秩序和人民群众生活秩序。现在闹得连国事活动都不能正常进行，连欢迎戈尔巴乔夫的仪式和接待活动都不能正常进行，闹得连走路、上下班都成了问题，首都还有什么秩序？还能说没有损害国家利益、社会利益？还不是动乱？我们谁要承认这种行动不是动乱，实际上等于鼓励全国各地都可以像北京这样闹，那还怎么进行改革、开放，进行社会主义现代化建设！但是，必须把煽动、制造动乱的极少数极少数人，和动机纯洁的学生及其他善良的人们严格区分开。
    三、国务院决定首都部分地区戒严合法不合法？有人说，国务院没有这个权力，全国人大常委会应当撤销国务院宣布的戒严令。这里，有些是对宪法不熟悉或者有误解，有的则是别有用心。宪法第八十九条第十六项规定，国务院有权决定省、自治区、直辖市的范围内部分地区的戒严。北京市总面积一万六、七千平方公里，实行戒严的地区不过千把平方公里。为了维护宪法的尊严，维护首都的社会秩序、生产秩序、工作秩序、教学科研秩序和人民群众生活秩序，国务院决定首都部分地区戒严，完全是合法的、必要的、正确的。宪法第六十七条第七项规定，全国人大常委会有权撤销国务院制定的同宪法、法律相抵触的行政法规、决定和命令。请注意，这里讲的是同宪法、法律相“抵触”的，不是别的。国务院的戒严令完全符合宪法和法律，同宪法和法律丝毫没有抵触。全国人大常委会怎么能不支持呢？
    四、任何组织和个人都必须遵守宪法和法律。宪法规定，“全国各族人民、一切国家机关和武装力量、各政党和各社会团体、各企业事业组织，必须以宪法为根本的活动准则”，“必须遵守宪法和法律”，“一切违反宪法和法律的行为，必须予以追究”，“任何组织或者个人都不得有超越宪法和法律的特权”。中国共产党在党章中也明确规定，“党必须在宪法和法律的范围内活动”。国家机关，包括国务院，也包括全国人大常委会；各政党，包括共产党，也包括各民主党派；个人，包括普通老百姓，也包括党和国家领导人。法律面前人人平等，谁都必须在宪法和法律的范围内活动，谁都没有超越宪法和法律的特权。有的人嘴上讲法制，实际上不仅自己践踏宪法和法律，还煽动别人违反宪法和法律，请学生们和各界群众提高警惕。
