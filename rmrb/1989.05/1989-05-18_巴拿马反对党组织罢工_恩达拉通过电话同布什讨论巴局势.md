Panama opposition parties organize strike
Endara discusses situation with Bush over the phone

    BANAMA CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) - Panama's opposition parties organized a nationwide 24-hour strike on May 17 to protest the government's declaration that the May 7 elections were invalid, demanding that the government respect the will of the people.

    The strike organizers, the Democratic Alliance of Panama's Civic Opposition, claimed that 75% of the country's sectors ceased operations on May 17, with large enterprises and banks being the most affected. However, the National Committee of Unionized Workers, which supports the government, stated that only 25% of the country's productive sectors were affected by the strike.

    A reporter in the capital, Panama City, observed that most shops remained open, but their doors and windows were reinforced with iron bars, and there were few customers. Vehicles continued to travel on the streets, but there were few pedestrians. Meanwhile, numerous fully armed military police guarded various key transportation routes.

    The Panamanian government and the military took a series of preventive measures, including deploying large numbers of military personnel to commercial and residential areas and announcing severe penalties for private enterprises and shops that closed without government permission. It was reported that 10 people had been arrested.

    BANAMA CITY, May 17 (Xinhua) - Guillermo Endara, the presidential candidate of the Democratic Alliance of Panama's Civic Opposition, announced on May 17 that he had discussed the serious situation in Panama since the elections were declared invalid with U.S. President George H.W. Bush over the phone on May 16.

    He said that during the nearly 10-minute conversation, President Bush expressed to him that "the United States has always acted in concert with all Latin American countries." Endara believed that the United States would not invade Panama.

    恩达拉通过电话同布什讨论巴局势
    据新华社巴拿马城５月１７日电（记者胡泰然）巴拿马反对党１７日组织了全国２４小时大罢工，抗议政府宣布５月７日大选无效，要求政府尊重民意。
    据罢工组织者巴拿马公民反对派民主联盟宣称，１７日全国有７５％的部门停业，尤其是大企业和银行界受影响最大。但亲政府的入会工人全国委员会指出，全国只有２５％的生产行业受到罢工影响。
    记者在首都巴拿马城市中心看到，大部分商店仍在营业，但商店的门窗都已装上铁栅栏，而顾客寥寥无几。车辆照常在街上行驶。但行人很少。与此同时，无数全副武装的军警守卫在各个交通要道。
    巴拿马政府和国防军采取一系列预防措施，其中包括向商业区和居民区派出大批军事人员、宣布将严厉制裁未经政府许可而停业的私人企业和商店。据报道，已有１０人被逮捕。
    据新华社巴拿马城５月１７日电　巴拿马公民反对派民主联盟总统候选人吉列尔莫·恩达拉１７日宣布，他和美国总统布什１６日在电话上讨论了巴拿马自大选被宣布无效后的严重局势。
    他说，在近１０分钟的谈话中，布什总统对他表示，“美国一直同所有拉美国家进行共同行动”。恩达拉认为，美国将不会对巴拿马进行侵略。
