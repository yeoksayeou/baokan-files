The National Bureau of Statistics has revealed that the overheated trend in group consumption has eased in the first quarter of this year, but non-controlled goods have seen an increase in sales to groups.

Since the fourth quarter of last year, when the range of controlled goods was expanded, various levels of government have attached great importance to anti-corruption efforts and strengthened audit supervision, achieving initial results in controlling purchases. The overheated trend in group consumption has eased. In the first quarter, the retail sales of consumer goods by social groups amounted to 1.713 billion yuan, an increase of 13.8% over the same period last year, which is lower than the 17.6% growth rate in the fourth quarter of last year. After excluding price factors, the actual volume of purchases has decreased. The proportion of group consumption in the total retail sales of consumer goods has also decreased from 9.9% last year to 9.2%.

However, two issues that warrant attention are: first, the practice of distributing goods through public funds persists in some regions despite being banned; second, there is a shift towards purchasing non-controlled goods, and this trend shows signs of further expansion. According to reports from the Dong'an Market in Beijing, while group purchases in the first quarter decreased by 29.9% compared to the same period last year, sales of non-controlled hats and shoes to groups increased by 21.8%, and department store sales increased by 15.7%.

　　第一季度统计表明
  　集团消费温度下降
  　非专控商品转热销
    本报讯  国家统计局透露，今年一季度集团消费过热势头有所减弱，但非专控商品对集团的销售额增长。
    社会集团消费自去年四季度扩大专控商品范围后，由于各级政府重视廉政建设，加强了审计监督，使控购工作取得了初步成效，集团消费过热势头有所减弱。一季度社会集团消费品零售额１７１．３亿元，比去年同期增长１３．８％，低于去年四季度增长１７．６％的速度，剔除价格因素后，实物购买量是减少的。集团消费占消费品零售额的比重也由去年的９．９％降为９．２％。
    但是，值得引起重视的一是公费发放实物的现象在一些地区仍禁而不止；二是出现了转向购买非专控商品的动向，并有继续扩张之势。据北京东安市场反映，一季度集团购买虽比去年同期下降２９．９％，但非专控的帽鞋类对集团的销售额却增长２１．８％，百货增１５．７％。
