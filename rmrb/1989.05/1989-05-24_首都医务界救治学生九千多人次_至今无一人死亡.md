    The capital's medical community has treated over 9,000 students
    No fatalities to date

    BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhua) — According to the Beijing Emergency Medical Center, during the 11 days of student hunger strikes and subsequent peaceful sit-ins at Tiananmen Square, the capital's medical community has spared no effort in treating the students, with no fatalities reported to date. As of 6 PM on May 24, a total of 9,158 students have been treated across 32 hospitals in the city, with 8,205 students under observation. Today, only 66 students remain under observation in several hospitals.

    A responsible official from the Beijing Health Bureau reported that since the students began their hunger strike at Tiananmen Square, the Beijing Emergency Medical Center and dozens of hospitals, including Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing Friendship Hospital, and Beijing Hospital, have been working around the clock to provide the best possible care for the students. Many medical staff have gone days without returning home, and some have even continued working despite being ill. With the help of students, their families, and various sectors of society, they have successfully completed the arduous and urgent rescue mission.

    After the students switched from hunger striking to peaceful sit-ins, some students fell ill with common colds, fevers, and diarrhea. Medical staff at the emergency center on the square have been taking effective measures to prevent and treat these illnesses. To date, there have been no outbreaks of infectious diseases among the students.

　　首都医务界救治学生九千多人次
    至今无一人死亡
    本报讯  记者赖仁琼报道：记者从北京市急救中心获悉：在天安门广场学生绝食及后来和平静坐请愿的１１天里，首都医务界广大医护人员竭尽全力救治学生，至今无一人死亡。截至５月２４日晚６点，全市３２所医院救治学生共９１５８人次，留院观察８２０５人次。今天，在几家医院继续留观的只有６６人。
    据北京市卫生局负责人介绍，天安门广场学生绝食以来，北京市急救中心及同仁、协和、友谊等几十家医院全力以赴，不分昼夜精心救治学生。许多医护人员几天几夜不回家，还有的带病坚持在广场抢救学生。在学生、家长及社会各界的大力协助、配合下，出色地完成了繁重、紧急的抢救任务。
    在绝食学生改静坐请愿以后，有学生患感冒、发烧、腹泻等，仍坚持在广场医疗点的急救中心的医护人员及时采取有效措施防治。到目前为止，学生中没有烈性传染病流行。
