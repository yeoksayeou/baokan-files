The 1987 National Gymnastics Training Conference issued a call to rescue the "Giant Panda," attracting widespread attention.

Two years later, at the National Gymnastics Training Conference held in Nanjing, a review and summary of the Chinese athletes' eleven major mistakes in the Seoul Olympics revealed a trend of declining performance and a lack of new stars. This further highlighted the need to rescue the spirit of diligence, dedication, and self-sacrifice that once characterized the Chinese gymnastics community, as well as the spirit of nurturing talent.

The root cause of the talent gap in gymnastics is the "win medals, win everything" mentality and short-term behavior that has disrupted the orderly process of talent cultivation. Gymnastics requires 6 to 8 years of painstaking effort to see results, but from provincial sports bureau directors to provincial team coaches, most are subject to a 4-year contract system. Some coaches even have to pay risk deposits. If they do not win medals during their tenure, they not only gain nothing but also face difficulties in sustaining their livelihood. In contrast, national team coaches are not under such pressure, as they have more athletes to work with. This situation forces provincial team coaches to rush into high-difficulty routines and seek immediate results. National team coaches, seeing that the athletes sent up lack a solid foundation, simply recruit 8- and 9-year-old children directly into the national team for training, thereby lowering the national team's standards and leading to a chaotic situation where coaches from youth sports schools, provincial teams, and the national team all compete to recruit children.

Recently, provincial team coaches are reluctant to send their carefully nurtured young talents to the national team, mainly due to a lack of trust in some young coaches in the national team who have neither outstanding achievements nor coaching experience.

In Hubei, two young talents who won two silver medals at the City Games last year were selected by the national team. The Hubei women's team had placed all their hopes on them for the second National Youth Games, only to see them eliminated in the preliminaries, leaving the Hubei coaches struggling to maintain their footing in the province. Du Shulan, a female coach from Jilin, could not hold back her tears when recalling how her promising talent was injured while training with the national team.

How can Chinese gymnastics reverse this situation and regain its former glory?

Firstly, the State Sports General Administration should not just pay lip service or issue documents, but take concrete actions to implement preferential policies, making broad coaches truly feel that Chinese gymnastics is indeed the "Giant Panda" of Chinese sports.

The Chinese gymnastics community urgently needs to establish an authoritative leadership team to correctly guide the development of Chinese gymnastics, straighten out the relationships between different levels of training, and solve major problems in the gymnastics community.

While calling for the spirit of nurturing talent, economic levers, honor levers, and interest levers should be used to mobilize the enthusiasm of local team coaches. Coaches who send outstanding talents to the national team should be given priority to participate in medium- and small-scale international competitions abroad, receive talent transfer awards, and have their professional titles resolved.

As long as we pool our wisdom and unite as one, the Chinese gymnastics team will surely appear with new vitality in next year's Asian Games and the 1992 Olympics. All gymnastics coaches have such confidence.

　　“大熊猫”能否绝处逢生
    ——来自体操界的纷纷议论
    林利锋
    １９８７年全国体操训练工作会议发出抢救“大熊猫”的呼吁，引起人们密切关注。
    两年后的今天，在南京召开的全国体操训练工作座谈会上，对中国选手在汉城奥运会上十一人次大失误的回顾和总结，透过青黄不接、新星寥寥的滑坡现象，人们进一步觉察到：中国体操界往昔那种勤勤恳恳、默默无闻打基础的奉献劲头，那股乐于输送人才的人梯精神，更需要大力抢救。
    造成体操人才断代的原因，是“有了金牌就有了一切”的急功近利的思潮和短期行为打乱了体操层层衔接的人才培养规律。体操是需６年至８年方见成果的慢功细活，而从省体委主任到省队教练，大多实行４年左右合同制。有的教练还要交风险抵押金。如果在任职执教期间拿不到奖牌，非但一无所有，甚至连立足生存都很困难。而国家队教练则无此虞，选手多，东边不亮西边亮。这种情况，迫使地方队教练急于上难度，急于在自己手中出成绩。国家队教练见输送上来的苗子基本功不够格，干脆把８、９岁的儿童直接挑入国家队训练，从而降低了国家队的水平，导致从少体校、省队到国家队的教练一窝蜂去抓娃娃的混乱状态。
    省队教练近来不愿把自己数年心血浇灌出来的新苗送给国家队，主要是对国家队里某些既无显赫业绩、又无执教经验的青年教练不信任，不放心。
    湖北有两个新苗，去年城运会上获两枚银牌而被国家队挑走。湖北女队把进军第二届青运会的宝几乎全押到她们身上，不料，预赛中全被淘汰，弄得湖北教练连在省里立足都十分艰难。吉林女教练杜淑兰，一提起她含辛茹苦培养出的很有前途的苗子在国家队练伤的事情，则禁不住泪水涟涟。
    中国体操如何才能扭转上述局面，重振雄风？
    首先，国家体委不是从口头上和文件上，而是以兑现优惠政策的行动，让广大教练实实在在地感觉到，中国体操确实是中国体坛的“大熊猫”。
    中国体操界急需成立一个能正确引导中国体操走向的有权威的领导班子，来理顺各层次训练的关系，解决体操界的重大问题。
    在呼唤人梯精神的同时，要利用经济杠杆、荣誉杠杆和利益杠杆调动地方队教练的积极性。对于向国家队输送优秀人才的地方队教练，应优先安排出国参加中小型比赛，给予输送奖，并落实职称问题。
    只要集思广益，团结齐心，中国体操健儿就一定会以新的活力出现在明年的亚运会和１９９２年的奥运会上，广大体操教练都有这样的自信心。
