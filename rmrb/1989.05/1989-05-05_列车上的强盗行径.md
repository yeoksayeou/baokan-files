	Robbery on the Train
	(Part 1)

On the evening of February 21, I boarded the 304 train from Guangzhou to Chengdu at Shaoguan Station in Guangdong, heading back to Lianyuan City in Hunan. When I got on the train, I found that the 100 yuan in my pocket had vanished. After boarding, I noticed a group of people openly searching passengers one by one. When they searched me, seeing that I had no money, they punched me hard in the chest: "You penniless bum, fuck off!" I was very angry and reported this to the police and the train conductor nearby. However, they said, "We dare not intervene; if we do, we'll get beaten up." The poor security on the 304 train has been reported by the media, but to this day, the situation has not improved, which is truly worrying.

	Robbery on the Train
	(Part 2)

On the evening of March 26, when the 249 train I was on reached Yueyang at around 2 AM, the car was relatively empty, and many passengers had already fallen asleep. At this time, a group of about a dozen young men rushed into the car and searched the sleeping passengers one by one. Some passengers were searched four or five times, and even their underwear and shorts were searched repeatedly. After the train reached the terminal station in Hengyang, this group of young men walked through the station's luggage room unscathed.

Strangely, the train staff paid no attention to the criminals' actions and ignored the passengers' cries. Passengers needed to pay 10 yuan to enter the dining car to rest, but this group of young men moved freely on the train and could chat with the conductors and train staff in the dining car.

　　列车上的强盗行径
    （一）
    ２月２１日晚，我在广东韶关车站乘广州至成都的３０４次列车回湖南涟源市。上车时，我口袋里的１００元钱不翼而飞。上了车，我发现有一伙人公开对旅客逐个搜身，当搜到我时，这伙人见我身无分文，便狠狠地在我胸口捅了一拳：“穷光蛋，去你妈的！”我很气愤，便向不远处的公安人员和乘警反映，谁知他俩却说：“我们不敢管，管了要挨打。”３０４次列车治安差的情况，新闻单位曾披露过，可事到如今，仍不见好转，实在令人担忧。

    ３月２６日晚，我乘坐的２４９次列车行至岳阳时已是凌晨２时，车厢较空，很多旅客已经睡觉。这时，十几个青年窜进车厢，对睡觉的旅客挨个搜身，有的旅客被搜了四五次，连内衣短裤也被他们反复搜查。列车到达终点衡阳站后，这伙青年便大摇大摆地穿过车站行李房溜之大吉。
    奇怪的是列车工作人员对歹徒的所作所为视而不见，对旅客的喊声听而不闻。旅客进餐车休息需交１０元钱方可入座，而这伙青年竟在车上畅通无阻，并能与乘警、列车工作人员在餐车谈笑风生。
