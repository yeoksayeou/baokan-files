    The People's Daily, Lanzhou, May 12th - According to today's issue of the Gansu Daily, Dunhuang City has an annual death toll of over 500 people, yet in the past 30 years, not a single grave has taken up an inch of arable land from the living. The vast expanse of farmland around the ancient ruins of Yangguan is devoid of any tombs.

    Dunhuang is surrounded by desert and barren lands. As the population increases, the amount of arable land per person decreases, making the local farmers increasingly protective of their land. They have not even built a single temple.

　　敦煌绿洲不见坟
    本报兰州５月１２日电  据此间今日出版的甘肃日报报道：敦煌市每年死亡人数５００余人，３０年来却没有１个死人争夺活人１寸耕地。阳关故垒广袤的绿洲耕地上，见不到一座坟茔。
    敦煌周围是沙漠和戈壁。随着人口的增加，人均占有耕地减少，这里的农民越来越珍惜土地，一座庙宇都没建过。
