Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, May 9th.

In recent days, the number of Vietnamese boat people arriving in Hong Kong has surged, once again causing serious concern among various sectors of Hong Kong society.

According to statistics from the Hong Kong Government Information Services Department, in the first eight days of May alone, the total number of Vietnamese boat people arriving in Hong Kong reached 2,472. As a result, the current number of Vietnamese boat people stranded in Hong Kong has accumulated to 16,854. Including 14,550 Vietnamese refugees also stranded in Hong Kong, the total number has exceeded 30,000. Among them, more than 16,000 Vietnamese boat people arrived after the Hong Kong government implemented its screening policy on June 16 last year.

It is estimated that in the next few months, even more Vietnamese boat people will continue to arrive. The presence of so many Vietnamese people stranded in Hong Kong has already imposed a severe economic burden and social pressure on Hong Kong.

　　越南船民涌港暴增
    新华社香港５月９日电  近日来越南船民涌港激增，再次引起此间社会各界的严重不安。
    据香港政府新闻处统计，仅今年５月份的头８天，越南船民涌港总数就达２４７２人，至此，目前滞港越南船民累计达１６８５４人，加上滞港越南难民１４５５０人，总人数已逾３万。其中，有１．６万余名越南船民是在去年６月１６日港府实施甄别政策后抵港的。
    据估计，在未来几个月内将有更多的越南船民相继抵港。如此众多的越南人滞留在香港，已经给香港带来严重的经济负担与社会压力。
