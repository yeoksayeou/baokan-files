In recent years, many cities in China have faced water supply shortages. Fully utilizing power plant cooling water can not only alleviate urban water supply tensions but also save the country a significant amount of funds. The cooling water from the Huadian Yueyang Power Plant has become the water source for the Yueyang Second Water Plant, saving an initial investment of 100 million yuan and reducing annual operating costs by over 10 million yuan, as well as saving 360,000 tons of coal. The daily water supply of the Second Water Plant has doubled without additional investment, and the water quality is even better than the original design.

It is understood that during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the Huadian Group planned to build and expand 8 units of 700,000 kilowatt thermal power plants in Shanghai, Nantong, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Nanjing, Shijiazhuang, and Dalian. These power plants are mostly near cities or not far from cities, but the issue of how to utilize the cooling water has not been considered. It is suggested that relevant departments should fully consider this when planning and designing power plants to save national resources and reduce pollution of rivers.

　　设法利用电厂冷却水
    近年来，我国不少城市供水比较紧张。充分利用电厂冷却水不仅能缓解城市供水矛盾，而且还可为国家节省大量资金。华能岳阳电厂的冷却水成了岳阳市二水厂的水源，一次性节省投资１０００万元，另外每年还减少运行费用１００多万元，节煤３．６万吨。二水厂的日供水量在没有增加投资的情况下，增长了一倍，水质还比原设计的好。
    据了解，“七五”期间，华能总公司拟在上海、南通、福州、重庆、南京、石家庄、大连等地新建和扩建８座７０万千瓦机组火电厂。这些电厂大多靠近城市或离城市不远的地方，但都没有考虑冷却水如何利用问题。建议有关部门在规划、设计电厂时，应充分考虑，以节约国家资源，减少对河流的污染。
