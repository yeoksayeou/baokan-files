Our school is a rural middle school with 12 classes and over 600 teachers and staff. The school once dug a well, but due to the high terrain, the well dries up on sunny days, so teachers and students have to carry river water to drink.

Upstream from the river, there are densely populated villages and a rural hospital. Some people dump various kinds of waste and filth into the river. Now, the river water is dark green, with debris and decaying leaves floating on the surface. Occasionally, there are feces and dead rats flowing by, and sometimes even animal organs. During periods of drought when the river dries up, the riverbed is filled with a foul odor and swarms of flies. Teachers and students have to dig pits in the riverbed to collect water. To cook a meal, some teachers and their families have to get up early and work late to collect half a bucket of muddy water, which then needs to be left to settle for half a day.

Every time the seasons change, diseases break out in the school. Last spring, 80% of the students fell ill, and in the autumn, 60% of the teachers and students contracted dysentery, seriously damaging the health of teachers and students and disrupting normal teaching order.

The school has repeatedly reported this problem to the relevant departments, but it remains unresolved. We appeal to the relevant departments to take immediate measures and put an end to this situation.

### 师生常年吃污水　身体健康受损害

　　师生常年吃污水
  　身体健康受损害
    我校是一所乡村中学，有１２个教学班，师生员工共６００多人。我校曾挖了一口井，但因地势高，晴天井底干涸，师生们只得挑河水吃。
    河的上游村寨密集，还有一家乡村医院。一些人将各种污水脏物都倒在河里。现在，这条河河水呈暗绿色，残渣腐叶飘浮水上，时有粪便和死鼠流过，还经常有一些动物的内脏。若遇小河干旱断流，河滩上臭气熏天，苍蝇成群。师生们只得在河床中挖坑积水。为煮一顿饭，有些教师一家老少起早贪黑，积得半桶浑水，还须沉淀半日。
    每逢季节变化，学校疾病流行。去年春季，我校８０％的学生患病，秋季有６０％的师生患痢疾，严重损害了师生健康，影响了正常的教学秩序。
    我校将此问题多次向有关部门反映，然而一直悬而未决。呼吁有关部门尽快采取措施，不能让这种情况继续下去了。
