Public Security Bureau Spokesperson Answers Questions from Reporters

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 22 - On May 22, the spokesperson for the Public Security Bureau answered questions from reporters regarding the implementation of the State Council's martial law order.

Q: What is your opinion on the martial law order signed by Premier Li Peng?

A: Given the severe state of lawlessness and social disorder in Beijing over the past period, to effectively stop the social turmoil and restore normal social order, Premier Li Peng issued the order to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing. This is in accordance with the constitution and is correct. As a functional department of the government, the public security organs must resolutely implement this order.

Q: What main work has the public security organs done in implementing the martial law order?

A: The State Council's martial law order clearly stipulates that the martial law work is to be organized and implemented by the Beijing Municipal Government. According to my understanding, in accordance with the State Council's martial law order and the municipal government's order, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau and the People's Armed Police have mainly done the following:

1. Strengthening the management of social order to strive for an early restoration of normal social order.
2. Efforts to direct traffic and minimize losses caused by traffic congestion.
3. Strengthening the protection of party and government leadership organs and important departments and units.
4. Dealing with a few individuals who took advantage of the situation to engage in looting, arson, and robbery, and protecting public and private property and the personal safety of the people.

Currently, social order has not yet been restored to normal. Public security officers and People's Armed Police on duty have encountered many obstacles. We sincerely hope for the understanding and support of the general public, including patriotic students. Especially now, traffic congestion is very serious, causing great difficulties for the normal production, work, and life of the capital. We hope that citizens will actively cooperate with the public security traffic management departments to remove some roadblocks as soon as possible and ensure smooth traffic. Public security officers and People's Armed Police will further boost their spirits, fulfill their duties, and make new contributions to quickly stopping the turmoil and restoring the normal order of the capital.

Q: There are rumors that public security officers and the People's Armed Police are preparing to collaborate with the military to suppress students. What is your comment on this?

A: This is pure rumor. The mission of the people's police is to protect the people and serve the people wholeheartedly. Chairman Yang Shangkun pointed out that the partial entry of the military into Beijing is absolutely not directed against the students. Similarly, the public security officers and the People's Armed Police, in performing their duties according to law, are also not directed against the students, but are aimed at maintaining social stability and public order. In fact, the demands raised by the majority of young students, such as rectifying official corruption, opposing corruption, and accelerating the process of democratization, are in line with the common aspirations of all sectors of society, including public security officers and the People's Armed Police, and are completely consistent with the goals of the party and the government. For this reason, over the past month, public security organs at all levels across the country, in accordance with the instructions of the party and the government, have adopted a very tolerant and restrained attitude towards the overzealous and law-breaking actions that occurred during student marches and demonstrations. We believe that the majority of young students will gradually understand this in practice. However, due to the malicious rumors and incitement of a very small number of people with ulterior motives, the situation has developed to a very serious extent, and social order is in such chaos. We believe this is also not what the majority of students want. In this situation, if the government does not take decisive measures to control the situation, it will quickly develop into a nationwide turmoil, fundamentally harming the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, harming the construction of democracy and the rule of law, and harming the entire cause of socialist modernization. Obviously, this is contrary to the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country and is absolutely unacceptable. Therefore, public security organs at all levels will, under the leadership of the government, take all necessary coercive measures in accordance with the law to strive to restore and maintain normal social order as soon as possible. We hope that the majority of students and all sectors of society will understand and support and cooperate with our work.

Q: Will there be any accountability for those involved in this incident after it is over?

A: I have noticed that this is a question of concern to both students and their parents. On this matter, Premier Li Peng clearly stated in his speech at the Beijing Party, government, and military cadres' meeting that the patriotic enthusiasm of the majority of young students should be protected, and they should be strictly distinguished from the few who created the turmoil. Their overzealous actions during the student movement will not be pursued. We fully support the principle determined by the Central Committee and the State Council. From the perspective of the duties of the public security organs, to strengthen public security, it is necessary to severely crack down on those who take advantage of the situation to engage in looting and various illegal and criminal activities in accordance with the law.

　　就执行国务院戒严令有关问题
    公安部发言人答记者问
    新华社北京５月２２日电  公安部新闻发言人５月２２日就公安机关执行国务院戒严令的有关问题回答了记者的提问。
    问：你对李鹏总理签署的国务院戒严令有何看法？
    答：鉴于北京市近一时期无政府状态严重，社会秩序十分混乱的情况，为了有力制止社会动乱，恢复社会正常秩序，李鹏总理签署发布在北京市部分地区实行戒严的命令，这是符合宪法规定的，是正确的。公安机关作为政府所属的职能部门，要坚决执行这一命令。
    问：公安机关在执行戒严令方面主要做了哪些工作？
    答：国务院戒严令明确规定戒严工作由北京市政府组织实施。据我了解，根据国务院戒严令和市政府令，北京市公安机关、武警部队主要做了以下几方面工作：一是加强社会治安秩序的管理，力争早日使社会秩序恢复正常；二是努力疏导交通，尽可能减少由于交通阻塞所造成的损失；三是加强了党政领导机关和重要部门、单位的保卫；四是查处少数趁机搞打砸抢的违法犯罪分子，保护公私财产和人民群众的人身安全。由于目前社会秩序还没恢复正常，公安干警和武警指战员执勤工作遇到很多阻碍，真诚希望得到广大市民包括爱国学生的理解和支持。特别是当前交通阻塞十分严重，已给首都的正常生产、工作和市民生活造成极大困难，希望市民能积极协助公安交通管理部门尽快撤除一些地方的路障，保证交通畅通。广大公安干警和武警指战员将进一步振奋精神，恪尽职守，为尽快制止动乱，恢复首都的正常秩序做出新贡献。
    问：传闻公安干警和武警部队准备配合军队镇压学生，你对此有何评论？
    答：这种说法纯系谣言。人民警察的宗旨是保护人民的，全心全意为人民服务的。杨尚昆主席指出，部分军队进入北京绝对不是针对学生的。同样，公安干警和武警部队依法执行公务，也绝不是针对学生的，而是为了维护社会安定和治安秩序。事实上，广大青年学生提出的整治官倒，反对腐败和加速民主化进程等要求，是符合社会各界人民包括公安干警和武警部队的共同愿望的，也是同党和政府的目标完全一致的。有鉴于此，近一个多月，全国各级公安机关遵照党和政府的指示，对学生游行示威时出现的过激的、违反有关法规的言行，采取了十分宽容、克制的态度。我们相信，广大青年学生是会在实践中逐步加以理解的。但是，由于极少数别有用心的人造谣煽动，蛊惑人心，事态发展已到了非常严重的程度，社会秩序如此混乱，相信这也是广大同学所不希望的。在这种情况下，政府如不采取坚决果断措施控制事态，就会很快发展成为全国性大动乱，从根本上危害改革、开放政策的贯彻实施，危害国家的民主和法制建设，危害整个社会主义现代化事业，显然，这是违背全国各族人民根本利益的，是绝对不能容许的。为此，各级公安机关将在政府领导下，依法采取一切必要的强制措施，力争尽快恢复并保持正常的社会秩序，希望广大学生和社会各界予以理解，并支持和配合我们的工作。
    问：这次事件过后，对参与者是否还要追究责任？
    答：我注意到，这是目前学生和家长们普遍关心的问题。对此，李鹏总理在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话中明确指出，要保护广大青年学生的爱国热情，把他们同制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来，对他们在学潮中的过激言行不予追究。我们完全拥护中央和国务院确定的这一原则。从公安机关的职责来说，为了强化治安，必须依法严厉打击那些趁火打劫和进行各种违法犯罪活动的分子。
