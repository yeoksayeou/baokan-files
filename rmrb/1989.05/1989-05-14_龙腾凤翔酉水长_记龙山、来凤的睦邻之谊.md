Perhaps it is a coincidence: one is Longshan County in Hunan's Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, named after a mountain range that resembles a sleeping dragon, and the other is Laifeng County in Hubei's E'xi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, named after the legend of a phoenix descending. One dragon and one phoenix perfectly match the emblem of the Tujia people and symbolize the auspicious wish of "dragon and phoenix bringing good fortune, happiness and prosperity."

Leaving Longshan County, crossing the boundary river between the two counties—the You River, and the bridge connecting the two counties—the Unity Bridge, in just fifteen minutes you arrive in Laifeng County, crossing provincial, prefectural, and county borders.

Throughout history, from small disputes between brothers and neighbors to large conflicts between counties, provinces, and even countries, various frictions, disputes, and even armed conflicts and wars have been common. However, the people of Longshan and Laifeng counties have maintained harmonious relations for many years. Under the guidance of the Party's policies on ethnic minorities and reform and opening up, the two counties have worked together in unity and mutual assistance, flying side by side.

The capitals of Longshan and Laifeng counties are only 7 kilometers apart. The people of the two counties share the same firewood from the mountains and drink from the same river. As the leaders of the two counties put it, the unity and mutual assistance between Longshan and Laifeng are all-encompassing, rooted in every household.

Currently, various forms of mutual assistance and frequent friendly exchanges are taking place between the two counties. During leadership changes in the two counties, outgoing leaders visit the other county to say goodbye, and incoming leaders visit the other county to pay their respects, passing on the baton of friendship. When a performance troupe or team comes from outside, they perform in one county and then go to the other county. When there is a good movie, the two sides exchange films. The banks of the two counties can directly transfer funds. The schools of the two counties enroll students from each other. The two counties also frequently hold joint knowledge competitions, sports competitions, and singing contests. Last year, the two counties both attended the National Ethnic Unity and Progress Award Conference, using the same speech titled "Dragon and Phoenix Bringing Good Fortune, Flying Side by Side"… As for the close ties between the people, there are countless examples.

In Laifeng County's Hedong Township, which is a place where "one foot touches three provinces" (Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan), there is a skilled carpenter named Peng. People respectfully call him the "Governor of Three Provinces." It is said that he has three daughters, each as beautiful as a flower. One "flower" was "picked" by the neighboring Leizhai Township in Sichuan's Youyang County, one "flower" married into Longshan County's Guishan Township, and one "flower" stayed in the hometown. Whenever Peng has work, he just calls out, and the sons-in-law from the three provinces come to help, whether it's planting rice or other big or small tasks, they get it done. Peng also often goes to work in the three-province border area, exchanging information and spreading friendship. There are countless such folk tales of friendship, like the endless You River.

When talking about the Unity Bridge over the You River that connects the two counties, Comrade Xia from Laifeng County's Propaganda Department vividly recounted its "historical background": Before the You River was regulated, it often flooded, and people and vehicles between the two counties relied on wooden boats to cross, which was very inconvenient. In 1987, the two counties jointly built this bridge and named it the "Unity Bridge." This is a miniature and witness of the friendship between the two counties.

As the saying goes, "Ten fingers are not the same length." It is inevitable that there will be some conflicts between the two counties. The key is how to handle and resolve them.

The You River is the main water resource for Longshan and Laifeng counties. In recent years, both counties have built dams and reservoirs to divert water for irrigation and power generation. Initially, Laifeng County built a hydroelectric power station in Shuizhai Village. Due to the heightening of the dam, the water pump in Hongyan Village downstream in Longshan County could not lift water, affecting the planting of thousands of acres of rice fields. In desperation, 100 people from Hongyan Village armed with steel drills and hammers went to demolish the dam to release water. The people of Laifeng County were also unwilling to give in. The conflict was on the verge of breaking out. At this moment, the Party secretary of Longshan County rushed to the scene and, pointing to the vast fields of Laifeng County, said to the people of Hongyan Village, "Have you thought about it? If you destroy the dam, Laifeng County's ten thousand acres of rice fields will not be irrigated, and 1/3 of the units and families will not have electricity. Is our thousand acres more important, or is theirs ten thousand acres more important?" Just as he was speaking, the Party secretary of Laifeng County also arrived with a few technicians and said, "We are very sorry that our power station affected the spring planting in Hongyan Village. Now we are sending three technicians and allocating 10,000 yuan to help you reinstall the equipment and ensure water supply." Now, six power stations have been built on the You River, and the two counties have been helping each other.

With the development of the commodity economy, "competition" has come to the traditional unity and mutual assistance between the two counties. How to deal with this situation? The leaders of the two counties answered: Use competition as a driving force, promote each other; carry out competition on the basis of unity, and seek unity in competition, seeking common development and prosperity for the two counties.

In the past, Longshan and Laifeng were "Laifeng with a lonely phoenix, Longshan with a solitary dragon"; today, Longshan and Laifeng are "dragon and phoenix flying side by side, auspiciousness fills the mountains."

### 龙腾凤翔酉水长——记龙山、来凤的睦邻之谊

　　龙腾凤翔酉水长   
    ——记龙山、来凤的睦邻之谊
    本报记者  尹品端
    也许是偶然的巧合：一个是因山脉像卧龙而得名的湖南湘西土家族苗族自治州的龙山县，一个是因传说凤凰降落而得名的湖北鄂西土家族苗族自治州的来凤县，一龙一凤，正好是土家族的“旗徽”图案，也正好象征“龙凤呈祥，吉祥如意”的美好愿望。
    从龙山县城出发，越过两县的界河——酉水，跨过连接两县的桥梁——团结桥，十五分钟后便到了来凤县城，跨越了省界、州界、县界。
    古往今来，小如兄弟、邻里间，大至县与县、省与省、国与国间，发生各种摩擦、纠纷，甚至械斗、凶杀、战争，似属司空见惯。但龙山、来凤两县人民，多年来却一直和睦相处。在党的民族政策和改革、开放政策指引下，两县团结互助、比翼齐飞。
    龙山、来凤两县首府相距７公里。两县人民共烧一山柴，同饮一江水。用两县领导同志的话说，龙山和来凤的团结互助是全方位的，扎根于千家万户。
    现在，在两县之间，开展了多种形式的互助合作和频繁的友好往来。两县党政领导换届时，原任领导同志要到对方县告别，新任领导同志要到对方县拜访，传递友谊的“接力棒”；外地来了剧团和演出队，在一县演完，定要到另一县演出；有了好的电影，双方互相“跑片子”；两县银行可以直接过帐；两县的学校都招对方学生。两县还经常联合举办知识竞赛、体育比赛、百名歌手赛等活动；去年，两县同时出席了全国民族团结进步表彰大会，用的是同一篇发言稿，题目便是“龙凤呈祥，比翼齐飞”……至于民间的亲密联系，那更是不胜枚举。
    来凤县河东乡，是“一脚踏三省”（湘、鄂、川）的地方。河东乡有个能干的彭木匠，被人们尊称为“三省总督”。人说他有三个女儿，长得像三朵花。一朵“花”被相邻的四川酉阳县老寨乡“摘”走，一朵“花”嫁到了龙山县的桂圹乡，本乡留了一朵。彭木匠有事，只要一声喊，三省的女婿都来了，插秧、扮禾，大事、小事，就干完了。彭木匠也经常到这三省边界干活，通信息，传友情。类似的民间友谊佳话，就像千里酉水河，说不尽，流不完。
    谈到酉水河上连接两县的团结桥，来凤县宣传科的小田同志抑扬顿挫地讲述了它的“历史背景”：酉水没有治理前，经常涨洪水，两县之间的人和车辆靠木船摆渡，很不方便。１９８７年，两县共同修了这座桥，起名叫“团结桥”。这是两县情谊的缩影和见证。
    俗话说，十个指头不一般齐。两县之间不可能没有一点矛盾，关键在于怎样对待和处理。
    酉水河是龙山、来凤两县的主要水利资源。近年来，两县都拦河筑坝，引水灌溉和发电。起初，来凤县在水寨村建起了一座水电站。由于河坝加高，使位于下游的龙山县红岩村有一台水泵无法扬水，影响上千亩稻田插秧。一急之下，红岩村１００多人手持钢钎和铁锤要去掘坝放水，来凤县的群众也不肯相让。冲突大有一触即发之势。这时，龙山县委书记赶到现场，指着来凤那一片良田对红岩村的群众说：“你们想过没有，毁了河坝，来凤县上万亩稻田就得不到灌溉，１／３的单位和家庭就用不上电。是我们千亩重要，还是人家万亩重要？……”正说着，来凤县委书记也带着几个技术员赶来，说：“我们建电站影响了红岩村的春插，心里很难过，现在派来三名技术员，拨款１０００元，马上帮你们重新装机，保证供水。”现在，酉水河上修了六个电站，两县都是互帮互让。
    随着商品经济的发展，在两县团结互助传统中，走来了“竞争”这位“不速之客”，从此，团结与竞争同时存在。怎样对待这样的局面？两县领导的回答是：把竞争作为动力，互相促进；在团结基础上搞竞争，在竞争中求团结，求两县经济共同发展、共同繁荣。
    过去，龙山和来凤是“来凤栖孤凤，龙山卧独龙”；今天，龙山和来凤是“龙凤比翼起，祥瑞满山中”。
