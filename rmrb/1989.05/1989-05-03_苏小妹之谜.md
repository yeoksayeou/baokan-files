Title: The Mystery of Su Xiaomei

The literary world has always been full of interesting stories. In the Northern Song Dynasty, the Su family of Meishan was renowned, with "a family of three literary masters, and eight great writers throughout history," a fame that is well-known. It is said that there was also a younger sister, Su Xiaomei, whose talent was extraordinary. She once embarrassed her two elder brothers and posed three challenges to her new husband, stories that are widely circulated and almost household names. Some people have questioned this Su-Qin marriage, but they mainly doubt it because Qin Guan's wife had a different surname. The identity of Su Xiaomei remains a mystery.

The Qing Dynasty scholar Yuan Mei attempted to verify this. In his "Random Notes from the Garden of Cultivation," he cited two pieces of evidence: one from "Mozhuang Random Records," which states: "Madame Yan'an Su, whose poems are circulated in the world. Some say they were written by the younger sister of Su Dongpo, who married Liu Ziyu." The other from "Jupo Miscellany," which states: "The daughter of Old Su was young and fond of learning, and married the son of her maternal uncle, Cheng Jun, Mr. Cai." From this, he concluded: "Dongpo had only two sisters, one married Liu, and one married Cheng." Yuan Mei, who prided himself on being a great scholar, was surprisingly careless in his studies, taking hearsay as historical fact, and his conclusion can only be described as "scratching the itch through the boot."

In fact, there is no need to look far for evidence; by comparing the works left by the Su brothers, the mystery of the younger sister can be solved.

Su Shih had no sister. The three brothers, with the eldest, Su Jing, dying young, Su Shih and Su Zhe were close in age. Su Zhe's memorial to Su Shih says: "Thinking of my elder and younger brothers, I am the youngest," which can be used as evidence. They had an elder sister, who, according to the family's order of seniority, was called "Eighth Aunt." Su Shih and his sister were both raised by their wet nurse, Ren Cai Lian. Eighth Aunt's life was full of hardships. She obeyed her mother's command and reluctantly married a cousin from her maternal family, and died young, ending her life. Whether she was a talented woman? There is no text to prove it.

The Su brothers had a cousin, who was the fourth daughter of their second uncle, Su Huan. The Su brothers' generation had three people, and there were a total of sixteen cousins. According to the order of seniority, the Su brothers were near the end, and this cousin was the youngest, so she was the real Su Xiaomei. After growing up, Xiaomei married the Deputy Minister (equivalent to a sixth or seventh-rank official) Liu Zifeng. According to her husband's rank, she was enfeoffed as the Lady of Dehua County. The couple had two sons, who were intelligent and fond of learning, and asked Su Shih for advice on calligraphy. Su Shih wrote poems to encourage them. Xiaomei and her husband both fell ill and died during Su Shih's exile to Dian. After Su Shih returned north, he wrote memorials to commemorate them. Similarly, there is no text to prove that this younger sister had literary talent.

As for Liu Ziyu, he was an elder relative of Su Shih, and they often exchanged poems. When Liu Ziyu died, Su Shih wrote a memorial to commemorate him, praising Liu's poetic achievements as surpassing Meng Jiao, Jia Dao, Yuan Zhen, and even Bai Juyi, and saying: "Alas, you and I, not friends but in-laws. You have a worthy son, who will succeed you. Tall and thin are the two grandsons, who call me uncle." This clearly shows that Liu Ziyu was the father of Liu Zifeng (Zhongyuan) and the grandfather of the Lady of Dehua County. Furthermore, the Lady of Yan'an was the sister of Su Song from Dantu, who was indeed "proficient in literature," and had poems circulating in the world. "Mozhuang Random Records" mistakenly attributed Liu Ziyu as the husband of Su Xiaomei and associated the Lady of Yan'an with Su Shih's sister, which is a ridiculous argument.

　　苏小妹之谜
    朱靖宇
    古来文界多趣话。北宋眉山苏家，“一门父子三词客，千古文章八大家”，声闻藉藉。人传尚有一小妹，才情非凡，曾经两窘长兄，三难新郎，轶事载在众口，几乎家喻户晓。也有人对这段苏、秦姻缘质疑过，但多从秦观妻子别有姓氏为问，对苏小妹的身世尚属一谜。
    清人袁枚试图确证。他在《随园诗话》中转述了两段书证，一段引自《墨庄漫录》：“延安夫人苏氏，有词行世。或以为东坡女弟适柳子玉者所作。”一段引自《菊坡丛话》：“老苏之女幼而好学，嫁其母兄程浚之子之才先生。”他由此断言：“东坡止有二妹，一适柳，一适程也。”袁枚自诩大才子，治学却显得粗疏，奉传言为信史，结论只能是“隔靴搔痒”之谈。
    其实，不必舍近求远，就苏氏兄弟遗文参比，尽足破解小妹之谜。
    苏轼无妹。他兄弟三人，长兄景先早夭，苏轼、苏辙是挨肩。苏辙祭苏轼文章说：“念我伯仲，我处其季”，可供确证。他俩有个胞姐，按堂亲排行称名“八娘”，苏轼姐弟俩都由乳母任采莲带大。苏八娘生活道路坎坷，服从母命违心嫁给了舅父家一位表兄，抑郁早逝，终结一生。是否才女？没有文字表明。
    苏轼兄弟有个堂妹，是二伯父苏涣的第四个女儿。苏轼父辈三人，堂兄弟姐妹总计十六位。按行次计算，苏轼兄弟靠近末尾，这位堂妹最小，所以，这才是真正的苏小妹。小妹长大后嫁给了宣德郎（相当于六七品官）柳子文，按丈夫爵秩，被封德化县君。夫妻育有二子，聪明好学，向苏轼请教书法，苏轼写诗加以劝勉。小妹夫妇在东坡远谪儋耳时相继病故，苏轼北返后曾分别为文设祭。同样，没有任何文字，表明这位小妹的文才。
    至于柳子玉，乃是苏轼的长辈姻亲，彼此常有诗作倡酬。柳子玉去世，苏轼为文以祭，夸赞柳的诗作成就跨越了孟郊、贾岛、元稹以至白居易，并说：“嗟我与子，匪友维媾。子有令子，将大子后。颀然二孙，则谓我舅。”确切表明，柳子玉是柳子文（仲远）之父、德化县君的公爹。另外，延安夫人，则是丹徒人苏颂的妹妹，确是“颇工文翰”，有词传世。《墨庄漫录》编派柳子玉是苏小妹的丈夫，将延安夫人附会为苏轼的妹妹，是荒谬之论。
