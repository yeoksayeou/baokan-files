Measures to Maintain the Stability of the Capital and the Country

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 21st - The People's Liberation Army Daily today published an editorial titled "Measures to Maintain the Stability of the Capital and the Country," the full text of which is as follows:

According to the provisions of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Premier Li Peng signed an order from the State Council, starting from 10:00 AM on May 20th, to implement martial law in certain areas of Beijing. This is a decisive measure to quickly stop the spreading turmoil and maintain the stability of the capital and the country. It fully reflects the interests and wishes of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. The entire army enthusiastically supports this wise decision to defend the Four Cardinal Principles and the achievements of ten years of reform, and will resolutely implement it.

Implementing martial law is a last resort. In recent times, a small number of people have taken advantage of the patriotic fervor of young students to incite unrest and create turmoil. They have used various big and small posters, leaflets, and slogans to slander, defame, insult, and attack Party and state leaders, opposing the leadership of the Communist Party of China. They have fabricated various rumors to confuse people's minds, sow discord, and incite dissatisfaction with the Party and the government. They have instigated some people to travel around, incite strikes, stop classes, stop work, hold parades, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes to pressure the Party and the government. Since May, the number of students and other people participating in parades and demonstrations has increased, many universities have been paralyzed, public transportation is blocked everywhere, Party and government agencies have been attacked, public order has deteriorated, and the normal order of production, work, study, and life for the people of the entire city has been seriously disrupted. Some state activities in the highly anticipated Sino-Soviet high-level meeting have also been forced to change or cancel, severely damaging China's international image and reputation. Although the Party and the government have always adopted a tolerant and restrained attitude, some leaders have repeatedly had dialogues with some student representatives, patiently persuading and explaining, the situation has not subsided but has instead spread to other places and become more and more intense. The problems that have occurred in Beijing in recent days are similar to the beginning of the "Cultural Revolution." It is obvious that if decisive measures are not taken to stop this, China will fall into chaos, the achievements of ten years of reform will be destroyed, and the rectification and adjustment, economic development, rectification of corruption, strengthening of democratic and legal system construction, and improvement of people's lives will all become bubbles, and a very hopeful China will become a hopeless China.

We clearly know that the hearts of the majority of young students are good, and they do not want to create turmoil subjectively. They have patriotic enthusiasm, hoping to promote democracy, eliminate corruption, and many of their correct opinions are consistent with the goals that the Party and the government are striving to achieve, consistent with the wishes of the broad masses of the people, and consistent with the wishes of the officers and soldiers of our army. They are fundamentally different from the small number of people who are determined to create turmoil. But the development of the situation has completely not changed according to the subjective wishes of the young students, and is increasingly moving towards the opposite of their wishes. A large number of facts increasingly clearly show that the turmoil created by a small number of people is a planned and organized conspiracy, whose purpose is to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and negate the socialist system. This is a serious and serious political struggle related to the success or failure of reform and construction, and the future and destiny of the country and the nation. The entire army must see through the true nature of this turmoil, clearly recognize the essence of this struggle, recognize the seriousness of this struggle, and never be complacent!

The People's Liberation Army is the armed forces of the People's Republic of China, the main pillar of people's democratic dictatorship, and the loyal guardian of the people's interests. The Constitution clearly stipulates that the fundamental task of the People's Liberation Army is to consolidate national defense, resist aggression, defend the motherland, and defend the peaceful labor of the people. Stopping the turmoil, restoring order, and maintaining social stability, the army has the responsibility and obligation to play its due role. The entire army's officers and soldiers must closely unite around the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, maintain a high degree of concentration and unity, carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Military Commission, resolutely defend the authority of the Party and the government, and strive to fulfill the sacred mission entrusted to our army by the Constitution.

The people's army is closely connected with the people. Our army performs its duties, stops the turmoil, and maintains the fundamental interests of the people, maintains the production, work, study, and life order of all people, including the majority of young students, so that reform and opening up have a stable environment. The troops in the capital carry out martial law tasks, assist the capital's armed police and public security police in maintaining social order, and are absolutely not directed against young students. The officers and soldiers will strictly follow the orders of the Party and the government, will not harm good people, and will not harm young students. We believe that the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, young students, and all citizens who hope for stability and unity and look forward to the prosperity and strength of the country will fully understand and support the troops carrying out martial law tasks in various ways. The entire officers and soldiers carrying out martial law tasks must always model the execution of the country's laws, regulations, and policies, strictly abide by the discipline of the Party, the state, and the army, cherish every blade of grass and every tree in the capital, not take a needle or a thread from the people, and work together with people from all walks of life to stop the turmoil, restore order, maintain a stable and united political situation, and promote the cause of reform and construction!

    维护首都和全国稳定的重大措施
    新华社北京５月２１日电  《解放军报》今天发表题为《维护首都和全国稳定的重大措施》的社论，全文如下：
    根据中华人民共和国宪法的规定，李鹏总理签署国务院命令，从５月２０日１０时起在北京部分地区实行戒严。这是迅速制止正在蔓延的动乱，维护首都和全国稳定的果断措施。充分反映了全党、全军和全国人民的利益和愿望。全军同志对这一保卫四项基本原则和十年改革成果的英明决策热烈拥护，坚决贯彻执行。
    实行戒严是不得已的。近一个时期以来，极少数人利用青年学生的爱国热情，煽动闹事，制造动乱。他们利用各种大小字报、传单标语，放肆地诬蔑、丑化、谩骂、攻击党和国家领导人，反对中国共产党的领导；他们制造各种谣言，蛊惑人心，挑拨离间，煽动对党和政府的不满情绪；他们鼓动一些人四处串联，煽动罢课、罢教、罢工，搞游行示威，静坐绝食，向党和政府施加压力。进入５月份以来，卷入游行示威的学生和其他群众越来越多，许多高等学校陷于瘫痪，公共交通到处堵塞，党政机关受到冲击，社会治安恶化，严重干扰和破坏了全市人民的生产、工作、学习和生活的正常秩序。举世瞩目的中苏高级会晤中的一些国事活动安排，也因此而被迫变更或取消，极大地损害了我国的国际形象和声誉。尽管党和政府一直采取了忍让和克制的态度，一些领导多次与部分学生代表对话，反复地进行耐心的说服和解释，但事态并没有平息，反而向外地蔓延，愈演愈烈。这几天北京发生的问题，已经类似“文化大革命”开始时的情形。很显然，如果再不采取果断措施坚决加以制止，中国就将天下大乱，十年改革成果就会毁于一旦，治理整顿、发展经济、整治腐败、加强民主与法制建设，以及改善人民生活等等，都将化为泡影，一个很有希望的中国就会变成一个没有希望的中国。
    我们清楚地知道，广大青年学生的心灵是善良的，他们在主观上是不想搞动乱的。他们有爱国热情，希望促进民主，消除腐败，许多正确的意见同党和政府要努力实现的目标是一致的，同广大人民群众、同我军干部战士的愿望也是一致的。他们同一心制造动乱的极少数人有根本区别。但事态的发展已经完全不以青年学生的主观愿望为转移，正在越来越走向他们愿望的反面。大量事实越来越清楚地表明，极少数人制造的这场动乱，完全是有计划、有组织的阴谋活动，其目的就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。这是一场关系到改革和建设的成败，关系到国家和民族前途命运的严肃的严重的政治斗争。全军同志一定要看清这场动乱的真相，清醒地认识这场斗争的实质，认识这场斗争的严重性，千万不可掉以轻心！
    中国人民解放军是中华人民共和国的武装力量，是人民民主专政的主要支柱，是人民利益的忠诚卫士。宪法明确规定，人民解放军的根本任务，是巩固国防，抵抗侵略，保卫祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动。制止动乱，恢复秩序，维护社会安定，军队有责任、有义务发挥自己应有的作用。全军干部战士一定要紧紧团结在党中央、国务院、中央军委的周围，保持高度的集中统一，发扬军委邓小平主席倡导的“五种革命精神”，坚决维护党和政府的权威，竭尽全力圆满完成宪法赋予我军的神圣使命。
    人民军队同人民血肉相连。我军履行职责，制止动乱，为的是维护人民的根本利益，维护包括广大青年学生在内的全体人民的生产、工作、学习和生活秩序，使改革开放有一个稳定的环境。部队在首都执行戒严任务，协助首都武警、公安干警维护社会治安，绝对不是针对青年学生的。部队干部战士将严格遵照党和政府的命令，绝不伤害好人，更不会伤害青年学生。我们相信，广大的工人、农民、知识分子、青年学生，以及一切希望安定团结、盼望国家振兴富强的有责任感的公民，都会对执行戒严任务的部队给予充分的理解，给以各方面的支持。执行戒严任务的全体干部战士，要时时处处模范地执行国家的法律、法规和政策，严格遵守党、国家和军队的纪律，爱护首都一草一木，不拿群众一针一线，同各界人民群众一道，为制止动乱、恢复秩序，维护安定团结的政治局面，推进改革和建设大业而共同努力奋斗！
