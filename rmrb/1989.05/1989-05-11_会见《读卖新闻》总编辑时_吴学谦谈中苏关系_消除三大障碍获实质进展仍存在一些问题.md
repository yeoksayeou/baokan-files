Vice Premier Wu Xueqian said today that China and the Soviet Union still have differences on how to politically resolve the Cambodian issue, and the two sides will further exchange views during the upcoming high-level meeting.

Wu Xueqian made these remarks during a meeting with the editor-in-chief of Japan's Asahi Shimbun, Mr. Kato Hiroshi, at the Zhongnanhai's Ziguangge.

He said that the upcoming Sino-Soviet high-level meeting will change the abnormal state of relations between the two countries for decades and achieve normalization of relations.

He said that the two sides have made substantial progress in eliminating the three major obstacles to the normalization of relations, but some problems still exist.

He said the main issue is how to politically resolve the Cambodian issue. He said that both China and the Soviet Union agree on a political solution to the Cambodian issue, but the difference lies in that China advocates for the establishment of a quadripartite coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, while the Soviet Union has different ideas.

He said that this issue will still be discussed during the high-level meeting.

He said that China welcomes the Soviet Union's commitment to withdraw three-quarters of its current troops stationed in Mongolia in the near future. China also hopes that the remaining Soviet troops in Mongolia will be withdrawn as soon as possible.

He said that the Soviet Union has agreed in principle to significantly reduce its troops along the Sino-Soviet border.

In response to a question about Taiwan, Wu Xueqian said that Taiwan's insistence on the "anti-communist, anti-negotiation" and "three nos" policy is unrealistic.

He said, "We hope to first achieve 'three links' and also hope that both sides will negotiate for reunification."

He said, "Once we start talking, we can reach a consensus."

Regarding the relationship between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Wu Xueqian said that he believes the Japanese government can take further proactive measures to improve Japan-DPRK relations. He said that Japan's efforts will help improve Japan-DPRK relations.

He said that China's current relations with South Korea are limited to civilian trade relations. As these relations develop, if it is necessary to establish some institutions in the future, they will be of a civilian nature.

During the meeting, Wu Xueqian also said that he hopes that various sectors in Japan, especially the business community, will correctly understand the situation in China. China will continue to adhere to and strengthen reform and opening up, and hopes that Japanese business friends will not hesitate to develop trade relations with China and invest in China.

He said that China has always taken a positive attitude towards developing exchanges in various fields between China and Japan.

　　会见《读卖新闻》总编辑时    
    吴学谦谈中苏关系    
    消除三大障碍获实质进展仍存在一些问题
    新华社北京５月１１日电（记者杨子迪）国务院副总理吴学谦今天说，中国和苏联在如何政治解决柬埔寨问题上仍存在分歧，双方将在即将举行的高级会晤中进一步交换意见。
    吴学谦在中南海紫光阁会见日本《读卖新闻》总编辑加藤博久先生时说，即将举行的中苏高级会晤将改变几十年来两国关系不正常的状况，实现两国关系正常化。
    他说，中苏双方在消除妨碍关系正常化的三大障碍方面已取得了实质性的进展，但一些问题仍存在。
    他说，主要的问题是如何政治解决柬埔寨问题。他说，中苏双方都同意政治解决柬埔寨问题，分歧在于：中国主张在越南全部撤军后，柬埔寨应建立一个以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府，而苏联则有不同的想法。
    他说，这个问题在高级会晤中还要谈。
    他说，中国欢迎苏联关于近期内从蒙古撤走其现有驻军的３／４的承诺。中国同时希望，苏联把剩下的驻蒙军队尽快撤走。
    他说，苏联已原则同意大幅度减少它在中苏边界驻军。
    吴学谦在回答客人关于台湾的问题时说，台湾坚持“反共拒和”和“三不”方针是不现实的。
    他说：“我们希望首先实现‘三通’，还希望双方为实现统一而进行谈判。”
    他说，谈起来就好办了，大家可以取得共识。
    在谈到日本与朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的关系时，吴学谦说，他认为日本政府可进一步采取主动行动改善日朝关系。他说，日本的努力将有助于改善日朝关系。
    他说，中国目前与南朝鲜的关系仅限于民间贸易关系。随着这种关系的发展，将来如需要建立某种机构，也是民间性质的。
    在会见中，吴学谦还说，希望日本各界，尤其是企业界，能正确了解中国的形势。中国将继续坚持和加强改革开放，希望日本企业界朋友在发展与中国的贸易关系和对华投资时不要犹豫。
    他说，中国在发展各领域的中日交流方面，始终采取积极的态度。
