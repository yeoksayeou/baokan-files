	Production Slumps, Inventory Decreases, Demand Expands, Prices Rise:
	China's Material Supply Situation is Severe
	Material Departments Will Resolutely Implement the Mandatory Material Allocation Plan
	Ensure Key Construction Needs According to National Industrial Policies

	Xinhua News Agency reporters Wang Jinhu and Xu Kehong report from Jinan, May 7th: According to information from the national material work conference held in Weifang, Shandong, in the first four months of this year, China's energy and raw material production has "slumped," important material inventories have decreased, while social demand remains high. This situation has led to an increasing gap between supply and demand, making the material supply situation severe.

	Statistics show that due to significant underproduction and non-delivery in key coal-producing areas, coal supply is extremely tight, and prices have surged, becoming a major factor restricting national economic development. Iron, steel, copper, and soda ash, among other products, have seen a significant decline in the completion rate of state-ordered contracts, weakening the supply of physical materials for key production and construction.

	At the same time, all important production materials have seen prices rise due to sustained growth in social demand, with supply-demand contradictions intensifying. Originally, it was expected that reducing the scale of construction projects would significantly decrease the demand for construction materials, and prices would stabilize. However, since the scale of construction projects has not been effectively reduced, prices for these materials, after a brief period of stability in January and February, began to rise again in March.

	Experts analyzing the above situation emphasized that the fulfillment rate of state-ordered contracts for scarce materials has generally declined. Apart from objective factors such as energy supply and transportation constraints affecting production, some regions and enterprises have a weak sense of the need to prioritize mandatory plans. Therefore, the Material Department has required local material departments to resolutely implement the mandatory material allocation plan and strictly prohibit the unauthorized sale of planned materials outside the plan. Necessary exchanges between planned and non-planned materials must be conducted strictly according to regulations.

	It is understood that, in the face of a temporary inability to fundamentally resolve the shortage of production materials, the Material Department has ordered its subordinates in various regions to concentrate limited materials and allocate them according to the requirements of national industrial policies, truly ensuring the needs of key production and construction. While supplying planned materials to key users, materials organized by the Material Department outside the plan will also be sold with a bias, prioritizing the needs of key production and construction.

	Learning from the experiences of the material bureaus in Chengdu and Wuhan, material departments in various regions will also strive to directly allocate scarce materials to key users this year, reducing intermediate links and curbing the rapid rise in production material prices.

　　生产滑坡　库存下降　需求扩大　价格上涨   
    我国物资供应形势严峻    
    物资部门将坚决执行指令性物资分配计划   
    按照国家产业政策投放保证重点建设需要
    本报济南５月７日电　本报记者王锦鹄、新华社记者徐克洪报道：据在山东潍坊召开的全国物资工作会议提供的消息：今年前４个月，我国能源、原材料生产出现“滑坡”，重要物资库存下降，而社会需求却居高不下。这种情况使供需差额不断扩大，物资供应形势严峻。
    统计表明，由于重点产煤区欠产欠交很多，煤炭供应十分紧张，价格成倍上涨，已成为制约国民经济发展的重要因素。生铁、钢材、铜、纯碱等产品，国家订货合同的完成率继续以较大幅度下降，已使重点生产建设的实物供应能力减弱。
    与此同时，所有的重要生产资料，由于社会需求持续增长，供需矛盾加剧，一季度价格均在上涨。原来预计，压缩基建规模会使基建用物资大幅度减少，价格也会趋于平稳，但由于基建规模没有真正压下来，这部分物资的价格在一、二月份短期内相对平稳后，三月份开始又趋上扬。
    有关专家在分析了上述情况后强调指出，紧缺物资的国家订货合同兑现率普遍下降，除去能源供应和运力紧张等客观原因影响生产外，有些地区和企业对指令性计划必须首先完成的观念淡薄也是重要因素。为此，物资部已要求各地物资部门，坚决执行指令性物资分配计划，严禁擅自将计划内物资转计划外销售。必要的计划内外物资品种串换，要严格按规定进行。
    据悉，在生产资料供应短缺一时难以根本解决的情况下，物资部已指令各地所属部门，集中有限的物资，按照国家产业政策的要求投放，真正保证重点生产建设的需要。在把指令性计划内的物资供应给重点用户的同时，由物资部门自行组织的计划外物资，也将实行倾斜销售，优先满足重点生产建设需要。
    吸取成都、武汉两市物资局的经验，今年各地物资部门还将尽可能直接向重点用户投放紧缺物资，以减少中间环节，抑制生产资料价格的凶猛涨势。
