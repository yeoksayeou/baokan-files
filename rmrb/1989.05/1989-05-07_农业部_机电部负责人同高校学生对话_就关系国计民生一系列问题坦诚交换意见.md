Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 7th. People's Daily reporter Jiang Jianke, Xinhua News Agency reporter Pu Libie report: Today, Minister of Agriculture He Kang, Deputy Ministers Wang Lianzhen and Hong Lize, invited more than twenty students from Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Agricultural Engineering University to have an open and frank dialogue on issues related to agricultural production, agricultural education, and farmers' interests.

Some students mentioned that agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, but in reality, the state's investment in agriculture has been decreasing year by year. They requested the Ministry of Agriculture to explain this situation. He Kang said that in the past, there was a lot of talk about prioritizing agriculture, but actual actions were few. There was more verbal investment than actual investment. The fundamental reason is that for a long time, China has prioritized heavy industry over agriculture, leading to a serious imbalance between industry and agriculture. Additionally, there was an overly optimistic assessment of the agricultural situation in 1984. The Ministry of Agriculture bears responsibility for this. After four years of stagnation in agricultural production, various levels of leadership have now clearly recognized the importance of agriculture's foundational role. The central government has also clearly stated that developing agriculture requires not only policies and technology but also investment. From the current situation, most places have increased their investment in agriculture, and agriculture is starting to warm up. The long-term stagnation in crop production is expected to be reversed.

Students participating in the dialogue generally expressed dissatisfaction with the insufficient funding for agricultural universities. He Kang said that the funding for agricultural universities is indeed insufficient, even lower than that of other higher education institutions. This problem is concerning and is related to the state's reduction in agricultural investment. We have made great efforts to support education. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, the construction investment for the eighteen agricultural universities under our jurisdiction accounted for one-third of the total agricultural construction investment during the same period. Over the past ten years, although the total agricultural construction investment has been significantly reduced, the funds allocated to universities under our jurisdiction have remained at the level of 20%. Of course, these funds are still far from meeting actual needs. Currently, the facilities and teaching equipment of agricultural colleges are still very rudimentary. We are aware of this and are preparing to take measures to solve the problem as soon as possible. At the same time, we also hope that you can convey to everyone that we understand the country's current financial difficulties.

He Kang said that although the investment in agricultural infrastructure this year has been reduced by 13 million yuan, the educational funds for agricultural universities will increase by 1 million yuan. Students applauded and welcomed this.

During the dialogue, students from the two agricultural universities also reported that relevant units are still occupying part of their dormitories and requested that these units return the dormitories as agreed.

After the dialogue, some students reflected that they welcome such equal and frank dialogues, but they also hope that the government will take practical actions to quickly solve the various problems currently facing agricultural production and agricultural education.

People's Daily, Beijing, May 5th. Today in the afternoon, five deputy ministers and some bureau-level officials from the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics held a dialogue with twenty students from Beijing University of Technology, Beijing Institute of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, and Beijing Institute of Information Engineering. They discussed the students' proposals to increase educational funds, improve teaching and living conditions, improve the employment allocation of university graduates, how to evaluate the recent student movements, rectify the color TV market, and limit the import of cars.

One student pointed out that the resale of color TVs is rampant in society. Wang Guohua, Director of the Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, said that the color TV market was indeed chaotic in the previous period. Due to the sharp contradiction between supply and demand, weak macro-management, some regions exceeded the state's price limit and sold color TVs at high prices, and some units and individuals resold them for profit. Since February this year, the state has implemented a monopoly on color TVs. Currently, the phenomenon of high-price resale of color TVs has been basically stopped.

In response to the students' question about limiting the import of cars and developing domestic car production, Dai Shiqing, Acting Chairman of the China Automobile Industry Association, said that the state has decided to accelerate the development of domestic car production. Last year, Shanghai produced more than ten thousand Santana cars annually, "First Automobile Works" can produce several thousand Audi cars this year, and the "Second Automobile Works" has also determined the project for producing 300,000 cars. In two to three years, domestic cars can meet part of the domestic demand.

　　农业部　机电部负责人同高校学生对话    
    就关系国计民生一系列问题坦诚交换意见
    本报北京五月七日讯  本报记者蒋建科、新华社记者蒲立业报道：农业部部长何康，副部长王连铮、洪绂曾，今天上午邀请北京农业大学和北京农业工程大学的二十余名学生，就农业生产、农业教育和农民利益等问题进行了坦诚的对话。
    一些学生说，农业是国民经济的基础，但实际上国家对农业的投入却逐年减少，请农业部负责人对此作出解释。何康说，过去喊重视农业，确实是说的多，做的少，口头投入多，实际投入少，其根本原因是我国长期以来重工轻农，工农业比例严重失衡。此外，也有一九八四年对农业形势估计过分乐观的原因，我们农业部对此负有责任。经过农业生产持续四年徘徊，现在各级领导都已清楚地看到了农业基础地位的重要性。中央也已明确提出，发展农业不仅要靠政策、靠科技，更要靠投入。从今年的情况看，大多数地方已相应增加了农业投入，农业开始升温，种植业生产长期徘徊的局面可望扭转。
    参加对话的学生普遍对农业高校教育经费不足表示不满。何康说，农业高校教育经费不足，甚至低于其他高等院校，这个问题确实令人担忧，这个问题是同国家减少农业投入相联系的。我们是尽了很大努力来支持教育的，“六五”期间，我们用于十八所部属农业高校的基建投资，占同期整个农业基建投资的三分之一。近十年间，尽管整个农业基建投资大幅度减少，但我们用到部属高校的资金，仍保持在百分之二十的水平。当然，这些资金还远远满足不了实际需要。目前农业院校的校舍、教学设备都还非常简陋，这一点我们很清楚，也准备采取措施尽快解决。同时，我们也希望你们捎话给大家，体谅我们国家目前财政窘迫的困难。
    何康说，今年农业基本建设投资虽然减少一千三百万元，但我们用于农业高校的教育经费将增加一百万元。同学们对此鼓掌欢迎。
    对话会上，两所农业高校学生还反映，有关单位至今还占着他们的部分校舍，要求这些单位按照协议及早归还。
    对话结束后，一些同学反映，我们欢迎这样平等、坦诚的对话，但更希望政府拿出实际行动，尽快解决当前农业生产、农业教育所面临的各种问题。
    本报北京五月五日讯　今天下午，机电部的五位副部长及部分司局长同该部所属的北京理工大学、北京机械工业管理学院、北京信息工程学院的二十位同学进行了对话，就同学们提出的增加办学经费，改善教学、生活条件，改进大学生分配工作，如何评价这次学潮，整顿彩电市场，限制进口轿车等问题，谈了看法，与同学们交换了意见。
    有同学指出社会上彩电倒卖严重，机电部监察局局长汪国华说，前一阶段彩电市场确实比较混乱。由于彩电供需矛盾尖锐，宏观管理不力，一些地区突破国家限价，高价销售彩电，一些单位和个人转手倒卖，牟取暴利。从今年二月开始，国家已对彩电实行专营。目前，高价倒卖彩电现象已基本被制止。
    在回答同学们提出的限制进口轿车、发展国产轿车工业问题时，中国汽车工业联合会代理事长戴诗晴说，国家已经决定加快国产轿车工业的发展，去年上海桑塔纳轿车年产达一万多辆，“一汽”今年可生产几千辆奥迪轿车，“二汽”三十万辆轿车生产线项目也已经确定。两三年后，国产轿车可以满足国内部分需要。
