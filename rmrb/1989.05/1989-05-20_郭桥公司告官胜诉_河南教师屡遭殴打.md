Guoqiao Construction Company in Ningxia's Lingwu County sued the county government's "Construction Office" and won. In July 1985, the company signed a contract with the county government to build a judicial building, with the government responsible for providing steel, timber, and cement. However, during construction, the county government failed to provide the materials as agreed, forcing the company to purchase them at high prices. After the building passed inspection and was put into use, the relevant departments delayed paying the price difference. Guoqiao Construction Company filed a complaint with the Ningxia Intermediate People's Court. The court ruled in March this year that the Lingwu County Government should compensate Guoqiao Construction Company for the price difference of over 700,000 yuan.

Once known as the cradle of Chinese civilization, Henan Province in central China has seen a serious problem of teachers being assaulted. From early 1988 to the present, there have been 156 incidents of teachers being beaten or humiliated, averaging one incident every three days. Investigations show that most of these assaults on teachers occur in remote mountainous areas, with the perpetrators often being farmers and workers with limited education and legal knowledge.

    郭桥公司告官胜诉  河南教师屡遭殴打
    ●宁夏灵武县郭桥建筑公司与县政府“基建办”于一九八五年七月签订合同，规定钢材、木材、水泥由县府给指标，建造政法大楼。但施工中县府不履约给用材指标，郭桥公司只得高价购料。大楼经验收合格投入使用后，有关部门却迟迟不付差价款。郭桥公司投诉银南地区中级法院，经法院今年三月裁定，灵武县政府向郭桥公司补偿差价款七万余元。

    ●曾是中国文明摇篮的中原河南省，教师被殴打的情况严重。从一九八八年初至今，教师挨打、受辱事件达一百五十六起，平均每三天就发生一起。据调查，教师被殴事件大多发生在边远山区，行凶者多是文化、法律知识贫乏的农民和工人。
