	Workers in Leased and Contracted Enterprises in Liaoning Defend Their Rights
	Over 100 Factory Directors and Managers Removed

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shenyang on May 21, 123 factory directors (managers) in leased and contracted enterprises in Liaoning Province have been removed by workers' congresses or dismissed by higher authorities under strong demands from workers.

	According to an investigation and analysis by the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the main reasons these directors (managers) faced opposition from workers include: some used their power for personal gain, taking advantage of the leasing and contracting opportunities to enrich themselves; some were authoritarian and suppressed democracy; some distributed benefits unfairly, severely dampening workers' enthusiasm; some lacked business acumen and management skills, engaged in short-term behavior, and caused huge losses to the enterprises. In one machinery factory in Jinzhou, production had always been sluggish. After contracting, the factory made a profit of 80,000 yuan in 1988, but the contractor, without consulting anyone, used 55,000 yuan of the circulating funds to buy a house for himself. In a food fermentation factory in Benxi City, the lessee ignored the workers' opinions and made frequent wrong decisions, causing the enterprise to suffer huge losses.

　　辽宁租赁承包企业职工捍卫自身权益
    百余厂长经理被罢免
    据新华社沈阳５月２１日电  （记者马义）辽宁省已有１２３名租赁、承包企业的厂长（经理）被职代会罢免或在职工强烈要求下被上级免职。
    据辽宁省总工会调查分析，这些厂长（经理）受到职工反对的主要原因，有的是因为以权谋私，借租赁、承包之机中饱私囊；有的是作风武断专横，压制民主；有的分配极为不公，严重挫伤了职工积极性；有的业务素质差，管理水平低，短期行为严重，给企业带来巨大损失。锦州一家机械厂生产一直不景气，承包后，去年盈利８万元，承包人没同任何人商量，就拿出５．５万元流动资金为自己买住房。本溪市一家食品酿造厂的租赁者不听取职工的意见，决策又屡屡失误，企业蒙受巨大损失。
