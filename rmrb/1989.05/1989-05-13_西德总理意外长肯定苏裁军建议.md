West German Chancellor Unexpectedly Praises Soviet Disarmament Proposal

	The People's Daily, Bonn, May 13 — Reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports: West German Chancellor Kohl said yesterday that the recent disarmament proposal by Soviet leader Gorbachev is "a step in the right direction." He said that for West Germany, the key issue is to create a higher degree of security with fewer weapons and soldiers. Both the Soviet Union and NATO should ensure that their armed forces no longer have the capability to launch surprise attacks or invade each other, and both sides should build a relationship of trust.

	Chancellor Kohl made these remarks before meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, who came to West Germany to prepare for Gorbachev's official visit in June. According to reports, during the formal talks, Shevardnadze explained Gorbachev's new disarmament proposal to the West German leadership. Kohl said that many areas have shown signs of relaxation, proving that West Germany's stance is correct. He said that West Germany will consider the entire changes in the Warsaw Pact when discussing the overall NATO plan, and this attitude has been proven to be wise. When talking about West Germany's stance on the short-range missile issue, Kohl emphasized the link between the reduction of Warsaw Pact conventional forces and short-range nuclear weapons. He said: "The faster the Warsaw Pact's conventional forces advantage is reduced, the better the prospects for reaching an understanding on the short-range missile issue." He called for accelerating the Vienna disarmament talks. He also said that he has sufficient reason to believe that the NATO summit at the end of this month will achieve consensus.

	The People's Daily, Rome, May 13 — Reporter Luo Jin Biao reports: Italian Foreign Minister Andreotti, who is visiting Poland, said yesterday that Gorbachev's plan to reduce 500 short-range nuclear missiles is "quite positive," although the reduction number is still "not satisfactory," the NATO Council "should not miss this golden opportunity."

　　西德总理意外长肯定苏裁军建议
    本报波恩５月１３日电  记者江建国报道：西德总理科尔昨天说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫新近提出的裁军建议是“迈向正确方向的一步”。他说，对于西德来说，最关键的问题是要用更少的武器和士兵创造更大程度的安全，苏联和北约都应该使自己的武装力量不再具有突然袭击和入侵对方的能力，双方应建立信任的关系。
    科尔总理是在会见前来西德为戈尔巴乔夫６月正式访问作准备的苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽之前说这番话的。据报道，双方正式会谈时，谢瓦尔德纳泽向西德领导人解释了戈尔巴乔夫的裁军新建议。科尔表示说，许多领域已经出现松动，这证明西德采取的立场没有错。他说，西德在讨论北约总体方案时将考虑华约的全部变化，这个态度已被证明是明智的。在谈到西德对短导问题的态度时，科尔强调华约常规军备力量裁减与短程核武器的联系。他说：“华约的常规军备力量优势裁得越快，对短导问题取得谅解的前景就越好。”他要求加快维也纳裁军谈判进程。他还说，他有充分理由确信，本月底的北约首脑会议将会取得一致。
    本报罗马５月１３日电　记者罗晋标报道：正在波兰访问的意大利外交部长安德烈奥蒂昨天说，戈尔巴乔夫关于裁减５００枚短程导弹核武器的计划是“相当积极的”，尽管这个裁减数目还“不能令人满意”，北约理事会“不应失掉这一黄金机会”。
