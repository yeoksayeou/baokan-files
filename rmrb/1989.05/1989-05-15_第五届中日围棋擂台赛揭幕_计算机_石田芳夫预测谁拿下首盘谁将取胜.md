The Fifth Sino-Japanese Go Tournament Opens

"Computer" Ishida Yoshio Predicts Who Wins the First Match Will Win the Tournament

BEIJING, May 15 (Xinhua) — The opening ceremony of the Fifth Sino-Japanese Go Tournament was held this afternoon in Tokyo. The host introduced Nie Weiping, saying that this "Iron Gate" had given the Japanese side a hard time. He then asked Nie Weiping if there was any difference in his feelings when defeating Chinese players versus foreign players. Nie replied that he felt more joy in defeating the latter.

The chairman of the Japanese Go Association, Asada Shizuo, the Chinese representative Hao Keqiang, the representative of Asahi Shimbun, Ito Kunio, and the president of NEC Corporation, Sekimoto, all spoke at the opening ceremony. They enthusiastically praised the tournament for its contribution to the exchange of Go techniques between China and Japan and for promoting friendship between the peoples of the two countries. They also expressed their hopes for more brilliant moves and matches. The first match of this tournament is scheduled for tomorrow, with Yang Rishai, a 3-dan player from China, facing Iida Kiki, a 7-dan player from Japan.

After the opening ceremony, female players Zhang Xuan, a 7-dan from China, and Kobayashi Chizu, a 5-dan from Japan, played a speed Go match. Each move was limited to 20 seconds, and Zhang Xuan won in the middle of the game. The match and Nie Weiping's commentary in Japanese drew great interest from the attendees.

The reporter asked Ishida Yoshio, the 9-dan player known as the "electronic computer," to "calculate" the prospects of this tournament. Ishida quickly replied: The result of tomorrow's first match will also be the final result. This is because this type of team competition largely depends on momentum.

　　第五届中日围棋擂台赛揭幕     
    “计算机”石田芳夫预测谁拿下首盘谁将取胜
    本报东京５月１５日电  记者于青报道：第五届中日围棋擂台赛开幕式今天下午在东京举行。会议主持人向约５００名棋迷介绍聂卫平时说，这位铁大门使日方吃了不少苦头。他随即问聂卫平，战胜中国棋手和外国棋手的心情有什么不同。聂答战胜后者更高兴。
    日本棋院理事朝田静夫、中方代表郝克强、朝日新闻代表伊藤邦男、ＮＥＣ公司社长关本在开幕式上先后讲了话。热情赞扬擂台赛为中日围棋技艺交流，为促进中日人民友好作出了贡献，并期待出现更好的妙手和对局。本届擂台赛的第一场比赛定于明天举行，由中方杨士海三段出战日方依田纪基七段。
    开幕式结束后，女棋手中方的张璇七段和日方的小林千寿五段进行了一盘快棋表演赛。每手限时２０秒，最后张璇中盘胜。对局和聂卫平的日语讲棋引起与会者的极大兴趣。
    记者请号称电子计算机的石田芳夫九段“运算”本届比赛前景。石田九段快人快语：明天的第一盘比赛的胜负结果，也是最终结果。因为这种团体型的比赛很大程度取决于气势。
