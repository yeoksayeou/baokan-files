The current problem of youth smoking is becoming increasingly severe. Despite continuous anti-smoking propaganda, sometimes quite vigorous, the number of young smokers continues to rise. In fact, in addition to anti-smoking propaganda, there is also pro-smoking propaganda in society, and this type of propaganda is more vivid and powerful. This pro-smoking propaganda mainly comes from the film and television industry.

Nowadays, in many movies and TV shows that reflect modern life, there are almost always scenes of offering cigarettes, lighting cigarettes, smoking, and throwing cigarette butts. These scenes not only detail and repeatedly show the entire process of smoking, but the smokers also adopt a "stylish" and "dignified" posture while smoking. For example, when leaders are pondering important issues, they smoke heavily and pace back and forth; when guests visit or friends meet, they first offer cigarettes and then start talking; some fashionable young people, while smoking, leisurely blow a few smoke rings into the air. In news programs, it is also common to see people smoking heavily.

In films and television, not only are there frequent scenes of smoking, but the philosophy of smoking is also promoted. Smoking is seen as an indispensable part of life and a means of showing "etiquette," "dignity," and "style" in social settings. Many young people start smoking precisely to show off this "style," to display their "maturity" and "dignity" as adults. Even if they are choked by the smoke, they persist, gradually becoming addicted and turning into smokers.

Of course, it is not fair to blame the film and television industry entirely for youth smoking. However, in today's society where films and television are widely popular, their influence on young people cannot be ignored. I hope that film and television directors will take on the social responsibility of promoting anti-smoking, change the bad habit of "if the plot is not enough, add smoking and drinking," and reduce the number of scenes that pollute society.

### 影视界要带头“戒烟”

    影视界要带头“戒烟”
    当前，青少年吸烟问题日趋严重，尽管吸烟有害的宣传从未间断，有时声势还很大，但青少年吸烟人数仍然有增无减。其实，社会上除有反对吸烟的宣传外，还有鼓励吸烟的宣传，而且这种宣传比反对吸烟的宣传更形象、强大。这种鼓励吸烟的宣传，主要来自影视界。
    现在许多电影电视里，凡是反映现代生活的，几乎都有敬烟、点烟、吸烟、扔烟头的镜头，不但详细地、多次地重复吸烟的全过程，吸烟者还要摆出一副吸烟的“风度”和“派头”。如领导干部思考重大问题时，都要猛吸烟、踱方步；客人来访或朋友见面时，也是先敬烟，后谈话；一些穿着入时的青年人吸烟的时候，还要悠闲地向空中吐几个烟圈。在新闻节目中，也经常出现吞云吐雾的现象。
    影视中不仅经常出现吸烟镜头，而且对吸烟者的哲学也进行了发挥，把吸烟看成生活中不可缺少的一部分，是交际场合中“讲礼节”、“讲风度”、“摆派头”的一种手段。许多青少年开始吸烟时，也正是想摆一摆这种“派头”，以显示自己具有成年人的“成熟”和“风度”，即使被烟呛得难受也不肯罢休，而后则逐步上瘾变成烟民。
    当然，不能把青少年吸烟的责任都归咎于影视界，但在影视相当普及的今天，对青少年的影响是不可忽视的。我希望影视界的导演们要担负起宣传戒烟的社会责任，改变“戏不够、烟酒凑”的不良作风，减少污染社会的镜头。
