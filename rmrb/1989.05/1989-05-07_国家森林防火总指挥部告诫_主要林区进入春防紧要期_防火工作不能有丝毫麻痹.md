The State Forest Fire Command Center has warned that major forest areas have entered a critical period for spring fire prevention, and fire prevention work must not be complacent in the slightest.

The People's Daily reports that through the joint efforts of governments at all levels and various sectors, good results have been achieved in forest fire prevention this spring. As of the end of April, compared to the same period last year, which had the fewest forest fires on record, the number of forest fires has decreased by 35.8%, and the area of affected forests has decreased by 58.8%.

According to statistics, since the beginning of spring, there have been 17 major forest fires nationwide that have affected more than 100 hectares of forest or resulted in casualties, a decrease of 82.3% compared to the same period last year.

A responsible person from the State Forest Fire Command Center pointed out that the achievements of forest fire prevention work in the previous period should not be overestimated, and one should not be blindly optimistic. Currently, most regions in the country are still in the spring forest fire prevention period. The major forest areas in Northeast China, Inner Mongolia, and Southwest China have entered a critical period for spring fire prevention. According to weather forecasts, the temperature in these two major forest areas will remain high and dry in May. In the next 30 days or so, the task will be even more arduous, and the work will be more difficult. The State Forest Fire Command Center requires that officials at all levels of government and forest fire command organizations must not be complacent in their thinking and must not relax their work in the slightest.

　　国家森林防火总指挥部告诫    
    主要林区进入春防紧要期   
    防火工作不能有丝毫麻痹
    本报讯  经过各级政府和各方面的共同努力，今年春季森林防火工作取得了好成绩。截至４月底统计，与森林火灾最少年份的去年同期相比，森林火灾次数减少了３５．８％，受害森林面积减少了５８．８％。
    另据统计，入春以来全国共发生受害森林面积１００公顷以上或造成人员伤亡的重大火灾１７次，比去年同期减少了８２．３％。
    国家森林防火总指挥部负责人指出，各地对前一段森林防火工作取得的成绩不能估计过高，更不能盲目乐观。当前，全国大部分地区仍处于春季森林防火期，东北、内蒙古和西南主要林区已进入春防紧要期，据气象预报，５月份这两个主要林区气温持续偏高偏旱，在今后的３０多天里，任务更艰巨，工作难度更大。国家森林防火总指挥部要求各级政府和森林防火指挥机构的干部，思想上不能有丝毫麻痹，工作上不能有丝毫放松。
