The detour road is unpassable
– A Discussion with Comrade Liu Zhenbang
Ding Shengjun

I believe that the approach proposed by Comrade Liu Zhenbang, which involves developing animal husbandry to indirectly promote grain production and reduce human grain consumption, is not feasible. There are at least three issues that need to be clarified:

First, what should be planted in the fields to achieve higher yields? For comparability, American agricultural experts have compared the protein output per hectare of different animal and plant products, with the following results: soybeans 640 kg, corn 457 kg, rice 388 kg, wheat 274 kg, eggs 182 kg, chicken meat 116 kg, pork 65 kg, milk 59 kg, beef 51 kg. The protein output rate of grain crops in the fields is much higher than that of livestock farming. As for economic benefits, that is a complex issue. Currently, the returns from grain production are low due to price distortions and the scissors gap between industrial and agricultural products.

Second, can a focus on animal husbandry promote grain production? The 12 countries of the European Community have a grain self-sufficiency rate of 111%, and under conditions of grain surplus, expanding demand is a driving force for production. However, China's grain supply is insufficient. If the demand continues to expand too quickly and too rapidly, it will be detrimental to the balance of grain production and sales, to controlling inflation, and to improving the economic environment.

Third, is the grain consumption in Western Europe decreasing or increasing rapidly? Compared to 1970, the amount of grain consumed by residents of the European Community increased by an average of only 17.84 million tons per year in 1980, but the same period saw an average annual increase of 36.2 million tons in feed grain consumption. The facts prove that after adopting a focus on animal husbandry and changing the food structure, the consumption of grain does not decrease but instead increases dramatically. This is because animal products require several times the amount of grain and other plant feed to be converted.

At least in the near and medium term, the strategy of "five industries in parallel with agriculture as the foundation" and focusing on grain production is not a bad way to ensure the stable development of China's agriculture.

　　迂回道路走不通
    ——与刘振邦同志商榷
    丁声俊
    我认为，刘振邦同志提出的通过发展畜牧业，间接推动粮食生产的发展和减少人的口粮消费这条迂回的道路，是行不通的。这里至少有三个问题要弄清：
    第一，大田究竟种什么产出率高？为了有可比性，美国农业专家以每公顷耕地生产不同动、植物产品折合的蛋白质量进行了比较，结果是：大豆６４０公斤，玉米４５７公斤，稻谷３８８公斤，小麦２７４公斤，鸡蛋１８２公斤，鸡肉１１６公斤，猪肉６５公斤，牛奶５９公斤，牛肉５１公斤，大田种植禾本科粮食的蛋白质产出率远高于牧业。至于经济效益，那是个复杂的问题。现在种粮效益低，有价格扭曲，工农产品剪刀差等因素。
    第二，以牧为主能否推动粮食生产。欧洲共同体１２国粮食自给率高达１１１％，在粮食过剩的条件下，扩大需求是促进生产的动力。而我国粮食供给不足，如果继续过快、过猛地扩大需求，对粮食产销平衡、抑制通货膨胀、治理经济环境都是利少弊多。
    第三，西欧耗粮是速减还是剧增？１９８０年与１９７０年相比，欧洲共同体居民食用谷物量年均仅增加１７．８４万吨，但同期饲料谷物用量年均增长３６．２万吨。事实证明，实行以牧为主，改变食物结构后，消耗的粮食不是减少，而是剧增。因为动物食品需要几倍的粮食和其它植物性饲料转化而得。
    至少在近、中期内，“五业”并举农为本，全面发展粮为主不失为保证中国农业稳定发展的上策。
