Recently, I heard a financial official say that a lot of funds are currently in the hands of individual households, who are unwilling to deposit them in banks. He mentioned that the state is planning to increase deposit interest rates to "attract savings." I believe that simply raising interest rates will not solve the problem. Individual households are reluctant to deposit money in banks because some of the bank's practices are unreasonable. Here are a few examples:

1. My mother has a license to operate an individual business. In early 1987, she went to the bank to open an account, but the bank refused to do so.

2. My mother holds a check to withdraw money from the bank, but the bank does not distinguish between these deposits and whether they are net income. Any amount over 400 yuan is subject to a 55% "personal income adjustment tax." My mother is engaged in the business of mounting paintings, and half of the gross income from mounting one painting is the cost. If she has to pay 55% in taxes, she would have to pay out of her own pocket.

3. The cost of purchasing goods is high, but the bank regulates that the maximum amount that can be withdrawn at one time is 3,000 yuan.

These reasons cause individual households to hold large amounts of cash and be reluctant to deposit it in banks. Many individual households also try every means to evade taxes, thinking, "If caught, it's bad luck, if not caught, it's a big catch." I hope the People's Daily can reflect our voices.

### 个体户为何不愿在银行存款

　　个体户为何不愿在银行存款
    编辑同志：
    最近听到一位金融界负责人说，现在许多资金在个体户手里，不愿存银行，并说国家准备通过提高存款利率“吸储”。我认为仅靠提高利率并不能解决问题，个体户有钱不存银行是因为现在银行的一些办法不合理。试举几例：
    一、我母亲领照干个体，１９８７年初去银行开户，可银行就是不给立。
    二、我母亲持支票到银行取款，可银行不分清这些存款是否净收入，凡超４００元就按５５％征收“个人收入调节税”。我母亲是干裱画的，裱一张画毛收入里面有一半是成本。如按５５％交税，不是得倒贴？
    三、进货用钱多，但银行规定每次取款最多不能超过３０００元。
    以上原因，造成个体户手持大笔现款不愿存银行；许多个体户还千方百计偷税，所谓“抓住了就认倒霉，抓不着就捞一把”。希望人民日报反映我们的呼声。
