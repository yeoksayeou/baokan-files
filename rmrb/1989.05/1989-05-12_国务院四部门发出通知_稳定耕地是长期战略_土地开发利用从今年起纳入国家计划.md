    Four ministries issue notice
    Stabilizing arable land is a long-term strategy
    Land development and utilization to be included in national plan starting this year

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 12th: The State Land Administration, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Agriculture recently jointly issued a "Notice on Implementing Land Development and Utilization Plans." It is required that in the future, while protecting and utilizing existing arable land, new arable land must be developed in an organized and planned manner to continuously supplement arable land resources. Various levels of government must regard stabilizing arable land area as a long-term strategic task and grasp it firmly.

    The "Notice" states that to improve land development and utilization, starting this year, land development and utilization plans will be included in the national economic and social development plans. In principle, all regions that use agricultural land for construction must undertake the responsibility of developing new agricultural land. Construction land should, as far as possible, utilize wasteland, abandoned land, and other land resources to reduce the encroachment on arable land.

    The "Notice" proposes that the national land development and utilization guidance plan for this year is 515,000 acres, of which 300,000 acres are arable land. Each region should promptly decompose and implement the indicators level by level. Under the premise of protecting the ecological environment, efforts should be made to complete or exceed the plan. Regions with more arable land reserves should undertake more development tasks.

　　国务院四部门发出通知    
    稳定耕地是长期战略    
    土地开发利用从今年起纳入国家计划
    据新华社北京５月１２日电  国家土地管理局、国家计委、财政部和农业部近日联合发出《关于落实土地开发利用计划的通知》，要求各地今后必须在保护、利用好现有耕地的同时，有组织、有计划地开发新耕地，不断补充耕地资源。各级政府要把稳定耕地面积作为一项长期的战略任务，抓紧抓好。
    《通知》说，为了搞好土地开发利用，从今年起将土地开发利用计划纳入国民经济和社会发展计划。凡建设占用农用地的地区，原则上均应承担开发新农用地的义务。建设用地要尽可能地利用荒地、废弃地等土地资源，以减少对耕地的挤占。
    《通知》提出，今年全国土地开发利用指导性计划总指标为５１５万亩，其中耕地３００万亩。各地应将指标及时逐级分解落实。在保护生态环境的前提下，力争完成或超额完成计划。耕地后备资源较多的地区，应多承担开发任务。
