　　台湾成立“肃贪处”
    台湾“法务部”调查局最近正式成立“肃贪处”，并在岛内各处设立机动组，专责办理肃贪工作，加强整饬政风。
    该处设处长１人、副处长２人，下设５个科，分别掌握下列事项：１，肃贪工作之策划、推动、督导、考核；２，政风调查；３，贪污渎职之预防；４，贪污渎职之侦办；５，贪污渎职有关资料之搜集、统计、分析、运用及其他有关肃贪事项。
    此外，调查局还设置机动工作组，办理特定贪渎案例和机动支援各调查处站侦办重大贪渎案件。
    调查局表示，为提高“肃贪处”职权及扩大肃贪之成效，处长一职由该局副局长兼任，直接督导肃贪工作之执行，各调查站也可根据需要再增设肃贪科、组。 　　　　　　　　　（４月２１日《法制日报》　岗山文）
