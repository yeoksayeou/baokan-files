The correction of the case where the Anshan City Procuratorate in Liaoning Province wrongfully detained three lawyers is, in my opinion, an effective exercise of supervisory power by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

First, we need to clarify what "concealment" means. Article 188 of Chapter VIII of the Criminal Law states: "Judicial personnel who abuse their power and authority, who knowingly prosecute an innocent person, who knowingly conceal a guilty person and do not prosecute, or who deliberately pervert the course of justice, shall be sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment of not more than five years..." Here, it is mentioned that "concealment" is a crime, but this applies only to judicial personnel, not to lawyers. This is because Article 84 of the Criminal Law clearly states that "the judicial personnel referred to in this law are those who have the duties of investigation, prosecution, trial, and supervision of criminals," and does not include lawyers. Article 162 of the Criminal Law stipulates that those who harbor or provide false testimony to conceal counter-revolutionaries or other criminals shall be sentenced. This applies to everyone, and lawyers are no exception. However, this only applies to providing false testimony or hiding and concealing the criminal facts of criminals, and not to lawyers making defenses that are favorable to the defendant.

Defending the accused is a right granted to lawyers by the state and is also the main task of lawyers. Article 8 of the "Court Organization Law" stipulates that "the defendant has the right to appoint a lawyer to defend him." Article 118 of the "Criminal Procedure Law" also stipulates that in the first-instance procedure, "defense counsel shall defend." In particular, the "Temporary Regulations on Lawyers" stipulate that "acting as defense counsel" is one of the main businesses of lawyers, and it is stipulated that "lawyers shall perform their duties in accordance with the law and shall be protected by the state law. No unit or individual shall interfere." Therefore, the courts and procuratorates cannot arbitrarily label lawyers' defenses as concealment and detain or sentence them.

Of course, lawyers must correctly exercise their defense rights and not abuse their powers, as stipulated in the "Temporary Regulations on Lawyers," they must base their actions on facts and adhere to the law. Lawyers have the right to refuse to act as defense counsel if they believe the defendant has not truthfully stated the case.

In the course of defending, if lawyers, due to partiality and prejudice, do not understand the situation, or misapply the law, make mistakes, they should be criticized, educated, disciplined, or administratively sanctioned by the judicial administrative departments or the lawyers' association. However, as long as they do not knowingly collude with the defendant to commit fraud, deliberately fabricate facts, and misinterpret the law to exonerate them, they cannot be considered to have committed a crime and be punished. If defending in favor of the defendant is considered concealment, who would dare to defend?

According to the provisions of the Constitution, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress has the power to supervise the work of the Supreme People's Procuratorate; local people's congresses at various levels have the power to supervise the work of procuratorates at the same level. Of course, the supervisory work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress should focus on major issues and should not interfere with specific business matters. Specific business matters of lower-level procuratorates should be handled by the Supreme Procuratorate, but this case is not a general specific business matter; it involves principles, universal issues, and issues of national policies and legal systems. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress cannot ignore it. By organizing forces, conducting investigations, and proposing handling opinions, and then handing them over to the Supreme People's Procuratorate for handling, this is appropriate, "neither dereliction of duty nor overstepping authority."

　　法律应保护律师执行职务
    张友渔
    辽宁省鞍山市检察院逮捕三律师错案的纠正，我认为这是全国人大常委有效地行使了监督权。
    首先要弄清楚什么是“包庇罪”？刑法第八章第１８８条规定：“司法工作人员徇私舞弊，对明知是无罪的人而使他受追诉，对明知是有罪的人而故意‘包庇’不使他受追诉，或者故意颠倒黑白做枉法裁判的，处五年以下有期徒刑……”这里提到了“包庇”要判罪，但是指的是司法工作人员，不适用于律师。因刑法第８４条明确规定说明，“本法所说的司法工作人员是指有侦讯、检察、审判、监管人犯职务的人员”，不包括律师。刑法第１６２条规定，窝藏或者作假证明包庇反革命分子或其他犯罪分子的，都要判刑。这是适用于一切人，律师当然也不能例外。但这些只限于作假证明或隐瞒、掩饰犯罪分子的犯罪事实，而不是律师做了有利于被告的辩护就是包庇。
    为被告进行辩护是国家赋予律师的权利，也是律师的主要任务，《法院组织法》第８条规定：被告人“有权委托律师为他辩护。”《刑事诉讼法》第１１８条也规定，在第一审程序中，有“辩护人进行辩护”。特别是《律师暂行条例》把“担任辩护人”，作为律师的主要业务之一，并规定：“律师依法执行职务，受国家法律保护，任何单位、个人不得干涉”。因而，法院、检察院也不能把律师进行辩护，随便加以包庇罪的罪名，逮捕判刑。
    当然，律师要正确行使辩护权，不要滥用职权，像《律师暂行条例》所规定的那样，必须以事实为根据，以法律为准绳。律师认为被告人没有如实陈述案情，有权拒绝担任辩护人。
    律师在进行辩护中，由于偏听偏信没有弄清情况，或对法律运用不当，犯了错误，应当受到司法行政部门或律师协会的批评、教育、惩戒、行政处分，但只要不是明知被告人有罪，而与之通同作弊，故意捏造事实，曲解法律，为之开脱，就不能认为是犯罪，处以刑罚。如果把做有利于被告人的辩护，都作为包庇罪，谁还敢来辩护呢？
    根据宪法的规定，全国人大常委会有监督最高人民检察院的工作之权；地方各级人大常委会有监督同级检察院的工作之权。当然全国人大常委会的监督工作，应抓大事，不宜管具体业务，下级检察院的具体业务，应由最高检察院管，但本案不是一般具体业务，是涉及原则性、普遍性的问题，涉及方针、政策、国家法律制度的问题，全国人大常委会不能不过问。经过组织力量，调查研究，提出处理意见，交由最高人民检察院处理，是恰当的，“既不失职，也不越权”。
