Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, April 29th.

Saudi Arabia's Minister of Hajj and Religious Endowments, Abdul Wahab, today called on all Islamic countries, including Iran, to adhere to the arrangements for the Hajj pilgrimage.

The minister stated that Islamic countries should send pilgrims to Mecca and Medina according to the designated quotas for the upcoming Hajj season.

Wahab's remarks were in response to Iranian officials who had previously criticized the quota system as an obstacle for Iranian pilgrims.

Iran annually sends 150,000 pilgrims. However, last year, Iran refused to send pilgrims to protest the reduction of its quota to 45,000.

The new Hajj quota allocation was approved in March last year by the 17th Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers. It stipulates that each country can send 1,000 pilgrims for every 100,000 of its population.

### 沙特要求伊朗遵守朝觐限额  每百万人可派一千人参加

　　沙特要求伊朗遵守朝觐限额    
    每百万人可派一千人参加
    新华社科威特４月２９日电  沙特朝觐和宗教基金大臣阿卜杜勒·瓦西今天呼吁包括伊朗在内的所有伊斯兰国家遵守有关朝圣的安排。
    这位大臣说，伊斯兰国家在即将到来的朝圣季节中都要按照所定名额派出到麦加和麦地那朝觐的穆斯林人数。
    瓦西的此番话是针对前些时候伊朗官员把规定名额说成是影响伊朗朝圣者朝觐的一个障碍而讲的。
    伊朗每年派出１５万朝觐者。但去年伊朗拒绝派人参加朝圣以抗议把它的名额减少到４．５万人。
    新的朝圣名额分配法是去年３月由第１７届伊斯兰外长会议通过的，它规定每１００万人可派１０００人参加朝圣。
