Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 26th.

Czechoslovakia announced on May 26th that it would expel three staff members from the British Embassy in Czechoslovakia and one staff member from the British Trade Mission, giving them 14 days to leave the country.

Local sources believe this is a retaliatory measure by Czechoslovakia in response to Britain's recent expulsion of three Czechoslovak diplomats and one technical staff member from the Czechoslovak mission in Britain.
