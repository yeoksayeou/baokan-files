	Reflections on a Small Green Forest
	Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute  Lǐ Chūnhuá

		I
	Under the spring sunlight, I planted a few small trees, and with them, a patch of green hope. I never thought about how they would grow in the summer; I only yearned for the place where my grandmother mended shoes and told stories.

	Only this barren yellow sand, lightly covering your feet. In the future springs, will you give me a green leaf, in the summer, a cool shade, and in the autumn, a golden yellow hue?

	Do you know? It is the earth that makes you grow day by day, reaching for the stars and kissing the sun. Yet, she remains forever silent, only opening her black, solemn eyes...

	Today, I stand still, facing you, gazing at your tender skin; tomorrow, when your branches and leaves are lush, I will still stand by your side, feeling each other's heartbeats, but never leaning on you.

		II
	I gently break off a willow branch, making a small willow flute, and I blow it, softly playing my childhood into the melody.

	When the tender treetops are adorned with shiny little stars, I worry, will the impending tide engulf you? Oh, your sturdy roots!

	When you remain silent, perhaps no one will cast a glance at you; but when you open a large green umbrella, there is no place for me to stand beneath it. Are you sad?

　　青青小树林断想
    北京第二外国语学院  李春华
    　　　　一
    春光下，我植下了一棵棵小树，也植下了一片片绿色的希望。没想过夏天里它如何生长，只惦念着外婆纳鞋底讲故事的地方。
    只有这贫瘠的黄沙土，轻轻地盖在你的脚上。以后的春天，你会给我一片绿叶，夏天给我一片凉荫，秋天给我一片金黄吗？
    你知道吗？是大地使你一天天生长，摘到了星群，吻到了太阳。她却永远沉默，只是睁一双黑黝黝的大眼……
    今天，我呆呆地面对着你，凝视你细嫩的肌肤；明天，你枝繁叶茂之时，我仍然与你并肩而立，感应彼此的心曲，却绝不靠倚着你。
    　　　　二
    我轻轻地折一枝柳枝，做成小小的柳笛，我吹，柔柔地把童年吹进笛声里。
    当柔嫩的树梢坠满晶莹的小星星时，我担心，那即将涌来的海潮，会把你淹没吗？噢，你坚实的根哟！
    当你沉默不语的时候，也许没有人为你笼一束目光；而当你撑开一把大绿伞时，伞下我寻不到一立足之地。你悲哀吗？
