Our bureau is responsible for the construction of the second phase of the national key project, the Datong to Qinhuangdao railway. Our second division is building the Lihe Grand Bridge. There are two roads leading to the construction site. However, the residents of Zhugao Dian Village in Zunhua County, Hebei Province, demanded that our division pay between 500 to 800 yuan for every vehicle that passes through. When this unreasonable demand was rejected, they organized several hundred villagers to plant trees on one road and dig trenches, set up barriers, and block the roads leading to the construction site on the other. Some villagers even assaulted our division's workers. We appeal to the relevant departments to take measures to solve this problem.

    村民刁难重点工程施工困难
    我们局担负国家重点工程大同至秦皇岛铁路二期工程建设。我们二处在修建黎河特大桥时，有两条路通向工地。但是，驻地河北遵化县炸糕店村提出：我处每过一趟车，要交五百元至八百元的买路钱。当这一不合理的要求遭到拒绝后，他们就组织全村几百人，在一条路上种上树，在另一条路上挖沟、设置栏杆，堵塞通向工地的道路。有些村民还殴打我处施工的职工。呼吁有关部门采取措施，解决这一问题。
