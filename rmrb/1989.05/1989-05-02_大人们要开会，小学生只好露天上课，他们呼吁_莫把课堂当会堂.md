On the morning of April 25, 10 vans and jeeps lined up and entered Wangfan Village in Yuncheng, Shanxi Province. The city was going to hold a meeting on the on-site transfer of collective land use rights here.

Around 9 a.m., the author arrived at the inner courtyard of the village committee of the village. Inside the courtyard, there were two formations of primary school students, each student leaning over a small stool to write. The sun shone on the children, and the scene seemed like they were being punished. The three classrooms in the row of houses, however, had their doors wide open to welcome guests. On the wall outside, there were two banners: "Deepening Reform and Strengthening Rural Land Management" and "Actively Exploring New Paths in Land Management." When I entered the middle classroom, I saw that it had been set up as a meeting venue, with desks arranged in the center and a cloth draped over them, on which were placed fruits, candies, melon seeds, and "Jinbanna" cigarettes. However, when I walked out of the classroom, the children in the courtyard were gone. Upon inquiry, I learned that the children had been given a holiday. So, I walked out of the courtyard and into the alley, where I saw seven or eight children playing. I asked them their names and why they weren't in school, but they all stared at me without saying a word. I asked again, and a boy replied, "I'm Fan Pu." I asked, "Why aren't you in school today?" He said, somewhat angrily, "You've taken our places!" I felt a pang in my heart.

The meeting began. In the classroom on the east side, some people were sitting, while in the middle classroom, experiences were being shared. The remaining classroom was locked. Upon observation, it was not just the village that used the classrooms for meetings; the township government, being located in the village, also frequently occupied them. On the blackboard in the east classroom, there was still a banner: "Wangfan Township Three-Level Cadres Meeting." In the middle classroom, there was another banner: "Wangfan Township Family Planning Dual Service Mobilization Meeting."

I had no intention of attending the meeting, so I went to the township government office, which was less than a hundred meters from the school. As soon as I entered the gate, I saw a "Shousheng Temple Main Hall." The door was open, and inside, there were only a few wooden planks, enough to accommodate several hundred people. Further in, the township government meeting room had sofas and tea tables, but no one was there. I thought, the meeting venues are empty, so why occupy the children's classrooms?

As far as I know, in rural areas, using classrooms as meeting venues is a relatively common phenomenon. As long as the village holds a meeting, the children have to take a holiday. If this continues, the normal teaching order of the school cannot be guaranteed. How can we talk about improving teaching quality? How can we talk about revitalizing education? More importantly, some county and division-level leaders sit in the classrooms to hold meetings, drinking tea, eating melon seeds, and smoking cigarettes, almost none of them realizing that this is an infringement, or even a crime. Therefore, we must appeal to governments at all levels: please do not occupy the children's places anymore!

### 大人们要开会，小学生只好露天上课，他们呼吁——莫把课堂当会堂

　　大人们要开会，小学生只好露天上课，他们呼吁——    
    莫把课堂当会堂
    ４月２５日晨，１０辆面包车、吉普车列队驶入山西运城市王范村。市里将在此召开集体土地使用权有偿转让现场会。
    ９时许，笔者来到该村村委会大院的里院，只见院内有两个小学生“方队”，每个学生都趴在方凳上写字。太阳照在孩子们的身上，那情形好似在承受某种惩罚。而那一排房屋中的三间教室，却都敞开房门欢迎来宾。室外的墙上贴着两条标语：“深化改革强化农村土地管理”，“积极探索土地管理新途径”。当我来到中间的一个教室时，只见里面布置成会场的模样，课桌围在中间，还搭上了花布单，上边放置了水果糖、瓜籽和“金版纳”香烟。但是，当我走出教室时，院中的孩子不见了。经打听，方知孩子们放假了。于是，我便出院来到巷子里，只见七八个孩子在玩，我问他们叫什么，为什么不上学，他们都圆睁着眼不吭声。我又追问，其中一男生回答：“我叫樊朴”。我问：“今天为什么不上学？”他带气似地说：“你们把我们的位置占了！”我听了，心里好一阵痛楚。
    会议开始了，东头的教室里坐着一部分人，中间的教室里介绍经验，剩下一个教室上了锁。经观察，村里开会占用教室不说，由于该村是乡政府所在地，乡里也经常占用。在东头一个教室的黑板上方，还留着会标：“王范乡三级干部会议”。中间的教室里也有一条会标：“王范乡计生双服务活动动员大会”。
    于是，我无意开会，便来到距学校不足百米的乡政府大院。进门就看见一座“寿圣寺正殿”。门开着，里面只有几根木料，足可容纳数百人。再往里走，乡政府会议室摆着沙发和茶几，空无一人。我想，开会的地方闲着，为什么去占孩子们的课堂？
    据笔者所知，在乡村，课堂被当作会场，是一种较为普遍的现象。只要村里开会，孩子们就只好放假。这样下去，学校的正常教学秩序得不到保证，何谈提高教学质量？何谈振兴教育？更值得深思的是，一些县团级领导干部坐在课堂上开会竟心安理得，喝茶水，嗑瓜籽，抽香烟，几乎没有一人意识到这是一种侵犯，抑或是一种犯罪。所以，我们有必要向各级政府发出呼吁：切莫再占孩子们的位置了！
