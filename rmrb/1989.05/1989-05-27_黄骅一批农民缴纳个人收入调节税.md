Recently, 621 farmers in Huanghua County, Hebei Province, voluntarily reported and paid their personal income adjustment tax, with the highest amount reaching over 11,000 yuan. In just 20 days, the county collected a total of 200,000 yuan in taxes.

Before Du Wenxian, the director of the Weaving Net Factory in Zhao Pu Township, went abroad for a study tour, he heard about the implementation of the personal income adjustment tax. He entrusted someone to pay 2,700 yuan on his behalf while he was abroad. He frankly said, "Life has improved, but I cannot just think about getting rich myself. I should pay taxes according to the state's laws and policies."

　　黄骅一批农民缴纳个人收入调节税
    最近，河北省黄骅县６２１名农民自觉向国家申报和缴纳个人收入调节税，其中，最多者高达１１０００余元。仅２０天时间，全县就征收入库２０万元。
    赵堡乡织网厂厂长杜文申出国考察前，听说要开征个人收入调节税，出国后委托别人代自己如数缴纳了２７００元。他坦诚地说：“生活好过了，可我不能只顾自己发财致富，而应按国家法律政策的规定缴纳税金。”
