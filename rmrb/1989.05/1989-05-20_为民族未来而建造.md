Reclaiming land from the sea and carving out a piece of land on the edge of the vast ocean is a monumental feat. Building a 32.5-kilometer-long dam in the midst of roaring waves is an even greater human achievement.

On a deep autumn day, my companions and I eagerly set out to visit the famous Zuiderzee Works in the Netherlands. The chairman of the Dutch Chinese Association, Mei Xuxua, drove us north from Amsterdam. The roads on both sides were lush with green grass. The black and white cows, renowned as the world's finest, were scattered across vast pastures, contentedly grazing. In the distance, the windmills, with their arms tired from centuries of labor, stood still. This pastoral scene was enchanting.

"We are about to reach the dam," Mei said softly, pulling me back from my daydream. Our car sped up onto the sea barrier. Wow! It was a breathtaking sight: the entire dam resembled a sharp sword, splitting the sea into two endless stretches towards the horizon. The top of the dam was a 4.5-meter-wide highway, with continuous lanes like strings of a harp, allowing colorful cars to play the grand symphony of life. After driving for five minutes, we had not even reached half of the dam. We got off the car and climbed up to a white four-story building by the roadside—the dam's observation tower. Gazing into the distance, we saw the Zuiderzee stretching endlessly, with waves crashing against the shore, their power still unabated. To the east, the other half of the Zuiderzee, now cut off, was calm and serene, with shimmering waves. Today, it has become a freshwater lake called IJsselmeer, covering an area of over 230,000 hectares. Looking at this magnificent sea barrier, one cannot help but admire the great creativity of the Dutch people.

Located in the western part of the European continent, the Netherlands is famously known as the "Low Country." With an area of 41,400 square kilometers, one-quarter of its land is below sea level, and one-third is only about one meter above sea level. When storms and tides strike, homes and fields can be swept away in an instant. To survive, the Dutch have built sturdy seawalls along most of their coasts. The Zuiderzee, which penetrates deep into the land, is like a gap in the continent. People living along its shores have long dreamed of building an impregnable wall to keep out the raging winds and waves. Two hundred years ago, Sir Cornelius Lely, following in his father's footsteps, proposed an ambitious plan: to connect the West Frisian Islands along the coast and build a dam. In 1891, civil engineer IJzebrand IJssel proposed another seemingly conservative but very clever plan: to build a dam in the inner third of the Zuiderzee, sealing it off. This would not only shorten the length of the dam but also utilize the West Frisian Islands to resist the tides. In 1916, a severe storm devastated the Zuiderzee coast, swallowing vast tracts of land. The wisdom of IJssel's plan was finally recognized, and it was officially approved by the Dutch Parliament in 1918.

The sea is vast and boundless. Where does one begin? IJssel chose the southern shore and the island of Wieringen, using his outstanding talent to lead the construction of a 2.5-kilometer short dam from 1920 to 1924. In reality, this was an artificial island equipped with 25 water gates, three ship locks, and all the necessary supporting infrastructure, serving as the forward base for building the sea barrier. The Dutch government then commissioned Professor Roelofs to further survey the dam foundation and accurately calculate the dam's ability to withstand the flow of seawater. After completing these tasks, in 1927, the Dutch people launched the "Battle of the Sea" from the north and south shores. They dredged clay from the sea and transported stones and sand from afar, pouring massive amounts of fill into the two parallel dikes built from the seabed... Fearless people mobilized 400 ships of various types, using the engineering technology of the 1920s to build the unparalleled Afsluitdijk. On May 18, 1932, at 1:02 AM, the dam was closed. Hundreds of ships gathered on both sides, their lights flashing and horns blaring, as if celebrating this great moment together. History will not forget those heroic builders. On the vast and flat dam, the Dutch people erected a monument to IJssel. Although this talented engineer passed away in 1929 and did not live to see today's dam, his lifelong wish was realized. The two shining lines of text on the Afsluitdijk observation tower are a true reflection of this wish: "A vibrant nation builds for its future!"

　　“为民族未来而建造”
    王舜华
    填海造地，在大海的边缘啃出一块陆地实属壮举，而在汹涛怒浪中铺筑３２．５公里长的大坝，更是人间的伟绩。
    一个深秋日子，我和同伴兴致勃勃地去参观闻名遐迩的荷兰巴里尔大坝。荷兰华侨联谊会梅旭华会长驾车带我们离开阿姆斯特丹北行。公路两旁绿草如茵，被誉为世界金榜之首的黑白奶牛，散落在连片的牧场上，怡然自得；远处的大风车，张着劳累了好几个世纪的臂膀，兀立不动了。这一派田园牧歌的景色，令人陶醉。
    “我们快要上坝了。”梅先生轻轻地呼唤，把我从梦幻似的畅想中招了回来。我们的汽车以高速登上了拦海大坝。嗬！那是另一番壮美的景象：整座大坝像把利剑，把大海一劈为二，遥遥无尽，伸向海天。坝顶又是一条４．５米宽的高速公路，那连绵不断的行车线，似道道琴弦，任彩色的车流尽情弹奏世间的壮歌。车行５分钟，还未及大坝的一半。我们下车登上路旁一幢白色的四层小楼——大坝的瞭望塔，放眼远眺，但见须德海莽莽苍苍，惊涛拍岸，余威未消；东边被拦腰截断的另一半须德海，寂静安详，波光粼粼，今天已成为一个拥有２３万多公顷水域的艾瑟尔淡水湖了。望着这气贯长虹的拦海巨坝，人们不能不佩服荷兰人民的伟大创造力。
    地处欧洲大陆西部的荷兰，是有名的“低地之国”。４１４００多平方公里土地，有１／４低于海平面，１／３也只高于海平面１米左右。一旦风暴挟着海潮袭来，顷刻之间田庐可以荡然无存。为了生存，荷兰人在多数海岸都筑有坚实的防护堤。楔入内地的须德海，有如大陆的缺口。居住在沿岸的人们，世世代代都梦想筑一道铜墙铁壁，御狂风恶浪于大门之外。２００年前，亨爵士·史蒂文子继父志，提出一个宏伟的计划：沿着海岸线的外围，把西弗里西亚群岛连结起来，筑一道大坝。１８９１年，水利工程师莱利则提出另一个看似保守却是十分聪明的方案：在内海１／３处修建大坝，拦腰封闭须德海。这样，既缩短了大坝的长度，又可利用西弗里西亚群岛抗击海潮。１９１６年，海潮肆虐，须德海沿岸大片土地被吞噬。莱利计划的合理性也终于为人们所认识，并且在１９１８年获得荷兰国会正式通过。
    大海茫茫，何处为始？莱利选择南岸与瓦灵根岛之间，以杰出的才能于１９２０—１９２４年先领导修筑起２．５公里的短坝。实际上，这是一个拥有２５个水闸、三个船闸以及全部配套工程的人工岛，是修筑拦海大坝的前进基地。荷兰政府又委派罗连契教授对坝基进一步勘探，精确计算大坝对海水流量的承受力等。在这一系列工作完成后，１９２７年，荷兰人民从南北两岸发起了“驯海大战”。他们从海里挖出粘土，从远处运来石块、沙土，向从水底筑垫起的两条平行堤坝内大量倾泻填料……无畏的人们动用４００艘各种船只、投进３．５亿立方填料，以二十年代的工程技术，建成了举世无双的巴里尔大坝。１９３２年５月１８日１时零２分，大坝合拢，数百艘船只聚集两旁，灯光闪烁，汽笛长鸣，仿佛在齐声欢庆这一伟大时刻的到来。历史不会忘记那些英雄的建设者。在平展无垠的大坝上，荷兰人为莱利树起了一座纪念碑。这位才华出众的工程师，虽然在１９２９年溘然离开了人世，没能看到今天的大坝，然而，他生前的愿望实现了。巴里尔大坝瞭望塔上熠熠发光的两行字，不愧是这一愿望的真实写照：“一个生气勃勃的民族，为它的未来而建造！”
