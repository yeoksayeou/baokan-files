Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 4th.

In the hands of United Nations official Mr. Dean, there is a road that transcends time: the rugged "desert line" that starts from Chang'an, crosses the Asian continent, and knocks on the doors of medieval Europe; the maritime route that winds through the South China Sea, though fraught with difficulties, allowed Venetian merchants to experience the beauty of the East as early as the Later Han period; the most northern "wilderness line," which boldly connects the Korean Peninsula and the Black Sea, but whose age seems to have been forgotten by all...

"This is the Silk Road from the 3rd century BC to the 13th century AD! Look, it is more magnificent than people imagine!" – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Deputy Assistant Director-General Mr. Dean pointed to the map in his hands, enthusiastically telling the reporter.

For centuries, humanity has never ceased its efforts to re-explore the Silk Road, but it has never systematically investigated this road that connects Eastern and Western civilizations. History is calling out to humanity. Scientists and news media from more than 30 countries around the world will, under the arrangement of UNESCO, conduct a comprehensive expedition and investigation of the Silk Road, covering aspects such as society, history, religion, trade, science and technology, culture, language, architecture, and archaeology.

On Mr. Dean's map, the Silk Road is actually a densely woven "web." As he pointed out, three "main routes of the Silk Road" became clearly distinguishable. Scientists will divide into three groups and begin their expeditions next year. The northern "wilderness route" starts from the shores of the Black Sea, following the ancient paths of nomadic tribes north of the Tian Shan Mountains, extending eastward. The expedition team will mainly consist of scientists from China and the Soviet Union, and the investigation will last for two months. The maritime expedition team will set sail from Venice, Italy, following the maritime trade route between Europe and Asia during the Later Han period, crossing the Indian Ocean to reach Guangzhou, China's southern gateway, and then possibly heading north to Osaka, Japan. Scientists from 14 countries and regions will participate in this four-month-long voyage.

The "desert route" between the north and south is undoubtedly the authentic Silk Road. The "caravan" carrying scientists from various countries will set out from Xi'an, the ancient capital of China, passing through the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, and Syria, and finally entering Istanbul, the southern gateway to Europe. This journey is estimated to take about three months. Mr. Dean said that among all the participating countries, China is the only country that will participate in the investigation of all three routes. Of course, whether it is searching for merchants from the Later Han period or tracing the horse troops of Genghis Khan, the descendants of the Yellow Emperor should have more to say than others.

Scientists call the Silk Road in front of them the "dialogue road." They will hold international seminars at 15 "stations" along the way, exchanging academic views with local Silk Road experts. The host countries of the "stations" will also hold various exhibitions and commemorative activities during the conference period.

Mr. Dean has just returned to Beijing from Xi'an. UNESCO and representatives from various countries participating in the investigation successfully held a preparatory meeting there in late April. The schedule, route, and activity agenda have all been determined, and the budget of $5 million has also been basically secured. After the spring flowers bloom next year, the expedition team will set out from Chang'an, following the long and winding "desert Silk Road" to find the glowing traces that once connected the East and West.

Question: "What is the biggest difficulty in organizing such a large-scale expedition by UNESCO?"

Answer: "The heritage on the Silk Road is too rich; we must focus on the most important aspects."

People have reason to believe that human wisdom and creativity should flow uninterruptedly on the Silk Road that our ancestors have already paved, from east to west and from west to east.

　　探索跨越时空之路   
    ——就联合国考察“丝绸之路”访迪安先生
    本报记者  景宪法
    展现在联合国官员迪安先生手中的，是跨越时空的道路：那条粗犷的“沙漠之线”，西出长安，横穿亚洲大陆，叩击着中世纪欧洲的大门；纵贯南中国海的那条航海线，虽然费尽周折，却早在后汉时期就使威尼斯的商人领略到了东瀛风光；最北边那条人烟罕至的“荒原之线”，胸怀坦荡地将朝鲜半岛和黑海牵在手中，但似乎谁也记不清它的年岁了……
    “这就是公元前３世纪到公元１３世纪的丝绸之路！瞧，它比人们想象中的要壮观得多吧。”——联合国教科文组织副助理总干事迪安先生指着手中的地图，兴致勃勃地对记者说。
    几个世纪以来，人类从未放弃过重新探索丝绸之路的努力，但是，人类至今也从未系统地考察过这条沟通东西方文明的道路。历史在向人类召唤。来自全世界３０多个国家的科学家和新闻媒介，将在联合国教科文组织的安排下，对丝绸之路进行一次包括社会、历史、宗教、贸易、科技、文化、语言、建筑、考古诸方面研究的综合性探险考察。
    丝绸之路在迪安先生展开的地图上，实际上是一张纹络密集的“网”。随着他的指点，三条“丝绸之路主干线”才清晰可辨。科学家们将兵分三路，于明年开始远征。北部的荒原之路从黑海之滨开始，沿着天山以北的游牧部落故辙向东延伸。考察队主要由中国和苏联两国科学家组成，考察时间为两个月。参加海路考察的船队将从意大利的威尼斯启锚，沿着中国后汉时期欧亚通商的航线，远渡印度洋，直抵中国的南大门广州，然后可能北上日本大阪。１４个国家和地区的科学家将参加这次长达４个月的远航。
    南北之间的“沙漠之路”，当推正宗的丝绸之路。载着各国科学家的“大篷车队”从中国的古都西安开拔，途经苏联、巴基斯坦、阿富汗、伊拉克、伊朗和叙利亚，最后进入欧洲的南大门伊斯坦布尔。此行估计需要３个月左右。迪安先生说，在所有参加考察的成员国中，中国是唯一的三条道路考察全都参加的国家。当然，无论是寻觅后汉时期的商贾，还是追踪当年成吉思汗的马队，炎黄子孙应该比别人更有发言权。
    科学家们将他们面前的丝绸之路称为“对话之路”。他们将在沿途１５个“驿站”上举行国际研讨会，同当地的丝绸之路专家进行学术交流。“驿站”所在国还将在会议期间举行有关的各种展览和纪念活动。
    迪安先生刚从西安回到北京。教科文组织和参加考察的各国代表于４月下旬在那里成功地举行了筹备会议。行期、路线、活动日程均已确定，总额为５００万美元的预算也基本上有了着落。明年春暖花开之后，考察队就要西出长安，沿着万里迢迢的“沙漠丝绸之路”去寻找那条曾联系东西方的闪光陈迹了。
    问题：“教科文组织举行如此规模的探险考察，最大的困难是什么？”
    回答：“丝绸之路上的遗产太丰富，我们必须抓住最主要的东西。”
    人们有理由认为，人类的智慧和创造，应该在已为祖先拓展的丝绸之路上，从东到西、由西向东，川流不息。
