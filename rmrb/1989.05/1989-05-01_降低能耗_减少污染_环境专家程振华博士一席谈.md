    Reducing Energy Consumption and Pollution
    — A Discussion with Environmental Expert Dr. Cheng Zhenhua

    Li Yong

    “Energy shortages are largely due to excessive energy consumption. Wasteful use of energy also results in serious environmental pollution.” He began by stating his viewpoints directly.

    Cheng Zhenhua, a thin-faced man, is a Ph.D. in Environmental Systems Engineering from Tsinghua University and currently serves as the Deputy Director of the Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences. His extensive research in environmental science has given him a deep understanding of the close relationship between the environment and energy.

    “The conventional thinking is that energy development must keep pace with economic development. Now that energy is in short supply, some people advocate accelerating energy development, but they overlook the fact that energy consumption is too high. If someone produces $100 worth of goods using just one ton of coal, but you need 3 or 4 tons, energy will naturally be insufficient. Our energy consumption is 4.97 times that of France, 3.82 times that of Brazil, and 1.65 times that of India. With low production and high consumption, how can energy not be tight? If we can reduce our energy consumption by half, bringing it to a level between Brazil and India, we can double our GDP on the current energy production base. Energy shortages will ease, and pollution caused by energy waste will be significantly reduced.”

    Coal accounts for 70% of China’s energy consumption, and the sulfur pollution from burning coal is the highest in the world. If we can wash and select the coal right after mining, removing the coal gangue and inorganic sulfur that do not burn well, we can significantly reduce sulfur pollution and recover 200,000 tons of sulfur concentrate, eliminating the need to import sulfur at a cost of tens of millions of dollars. Currently, with transportation so tight, every year we transport not only coal but also several million tons of rock! This is all due to high input and high output, and extensive management.

    To reduce energy consumption and move towards an intensive economy, what do we rely on? “Of course, it’s science and technology,” Cheng Zhenhua replied firmly. In the 1970s, Japan began restricting automobile emissions, which promoted the updating of automobile engines. Now, Japanese cars consume less fuel and emit less pollution. If we only use restrictive measures without researching practical technologies to reduce energy consumption, the result will be merely collecting more fines. From 1981 to 1987, the state invested 2.34 billion yuan in pollution control, but 1.2 billion yuan was wasted, with more than 70% of the waste due to scientific and technological factors. This is quite enlightening. He gestured with his long, thin fingers: “Management only skims the surface, collecting some floating oil, while science and technology tap into a vast oil field.”

　　降低能耗　减少污染   
    ——环境专家程振华博士一席谈
    李勇
    “能源紧张，能耗太高是重要原因之一。能源的浪费同时造成了环境严重污染。”他开门见山地亮出了自己的观点。
    面容清瘦的程振华是清华大学的环境系统工程博士，现任中国环境科学研究院副院长。环境科学的广泛研究，使他对环境与能源的紧密关系有切肤之感。
    “能源发展要跟上经济发展的步子，这是人们的习惯思维。现在能源紧张了，就有人呼吁加快能源开发，他们没有重视另一方面：能耗太高。假如别人生产１００美元的东西只要１吨煤，你却要３、４吨，能源当然不够用。我国能耗是法国的４．９７倍，巴西的３．８２倍，印度的１．６５倍，产得少、用得多，怎么不紧张呢？只要把能耗降低一半，达到巴西与印度之间的水平，我们就能在现有的能源产量基础上，使国民生产总值翻一番，能源紧张缓和了，能源浪费造成的污染也会大大降低。”
    煤炭，占我国能源的７０％，而烧煤造成的硫污染，也居世界首位。如果把开采出的煤就地洗选，去掉不好燃烧的煤矸石，无机硫，就可明显降低硫污染，并回收２００万吨硫精矿，不用再花几千万美元进口硫磺了。现在运输如此紧张，每年运煤的同时，运了几千万吨石头！这都是“高投入、高产出”，粗放经营造成的。
    要降低能耗，使经济走向集约化，靠什么呢？“当然是科学技术。”程振华肯定地回答。日本在七十年代开始限制汽车的排污，促进了汽车发动机的更新。现在，日本车耗油低，排污少。如果只是采用限制手段，却无人研究降低能耗的实用技术，结果只是多收一些罚款而已。国家１９８１年到１９８７年共拿出了２３４个亿投资污染防治，结果浪费了１２０多亿，其中７０％以上都是由于科学技术因素造成的。这很能给人一些启示。他用瘦长的手指比划着：“管理只捞到了水面上的一些浮油，而科学技术是开发了一个大油田。”
