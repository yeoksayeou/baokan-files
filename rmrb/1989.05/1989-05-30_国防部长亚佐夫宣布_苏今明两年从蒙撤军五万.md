Defense Minister Yazov announced that the Soviet Union will withdraw 50,000 troops and 11,000 major weapons from Mongolia over the next two years. He also revealed that the total strength of Soviet forces in the Far East is 597,600.

Yazov made this announcement in response to questions from *Pravda* reporters.

Regarding the Soviet withdrawal plan from Mongolia, he said that from 1989 to 1990, 75% of the ground forces and all air forces will be withdrawn, totaling 5 divisions, including one motorized infantry division, two tank divisions, and two air divisions, as well as some independent units. Additionally, 850 tanks, 1,100 armored vehicles, 820 artillery pieces, 190 aircraft, and 130 helicopters will be withdrawn.
