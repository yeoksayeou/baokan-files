	Kissinger Says Short-Range Missile Dispute Puts NATO in Crisis
	Cheney Believes Negotiating with the Soviets on Short-Range Missiles is a Serious Mistake

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 7 - Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said today in an interview with a television station that the current dispute between the U.S. and West Germany over short-range missiles is a serious crisis facing NATO, and efforts should be made to reverse this situation.

	Kissinger said that the issue of short-range missiles is not something that can be resolved by finding some form of wording to include in a communiqué. It involves whether NATO member countries should negotiate the deployment of missiles on their territory. Kissinger's remarks were directed at the dispute between the U.S. and West Germany over the short-range missile issue. Kissinger expressed his support for the Bush administration's "basic policy" on the short-range missile issue.

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 7 - U.S. Secretary of Defense Cheney said today that if the U.S. were to negotiate with the Soviet Union over short-range missiles, it would be "a serious mistake."

	Cheney said that the U.S. believes short-range missiles are a key component of NATO's defense strategy, and negotiating with the Soviet Union would mean possibly achieving a "third zero option," which is to eliminate short-range missiles like intermediate-range missiles.

	Cheney believes that the focus of European disarmament "should be on reducing conventional weapons," because the Warsaw Pact has a "dominant advantage" in conventional military forces. He emphasized that any negotiations on short-range missiles before the Warsaw Pact eliminates its conventional force advantage would lead to a nuclear-free Europe, placing Western Europe in a vulnerable position to Soviet attacks.

　　基辛格说短导争执   
    使北约面临着危机    
    切尼认为同苏谈判短导是严重错误
    新华社华盛顿５月７日电  美国前国务卿亨利·基辛格今天在接受一家电视台采访时说，目前美国同西德在短程导弹方面的争执是北约面临的严重危机，应设法扭转这一局面。
    基辛格说，短程导弹的问题不是设法找到某种形式的词句写入一项公报就能解决的，它牵涉到北约的成员国是否应就在该国领土上部署导弹进行谈判的问题。基辛格的话是针对美国和西德关于短导问题的争执而说的。基辛格表示，他支持布什政府关于短导问题的“基本政策”。
    新华社华盛顿５月７日电　美国国防部长切尼今天说，如果美国同苏联就短程导弹问题举行谈判，那将是“一个严重的错误”。
    切尼说，美国认为短程导弹是北约防务战略的关键组成部分，而同苏联谈判，就意味着可能实现“第三个零点方案”，即把短导像中导一样予以消除。
    切尼认为，欧洲裁军的重点“应放在削减常规武器方面”，因为华约在常规军事力量方面具有“压倒优势”。他强调在华约消除其常规力量优势之前，任何关于短程导弹的谈判都会导致欧洲无核化，使西欧处于易受苏联攻击的境地。
