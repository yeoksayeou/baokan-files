Beijing has entered the ninth day of martial law. Yesterday was a Sunday, and citizens seemed to have lost the initial apprehension that followed the announcement of martial law. Small and large shops were bustling with activity once again.

Around 2 PM, a procession primarily composed of university students marched through Chang'an Avenue and circled around Tiananmen Square. Traffic in the area was briefly disrupted. According to the broadcast vehicle accompanying the procession, this march was in response to an activity initiated by overseas Chinese.

News from Tiananmen Square indicated that despite the recent setup of new tents donated from various regions, students might still withdraw in the coming days.

As night fell, the heat persisted. Intersections became popular spots for citizens to cool off and chat. For Beijing residents, the allure of concerts by famous singers and high-level sports matches seemed to have diminished compared to the past. The martial law troops stationed outside the city continued to receive visiting delegations. Performances by some cultural workers received enthusiastic applause from the soldiers.

　　北京戒严第九天
    本报北京５月２９日凌晨讯  昨天是星期天，市民们似乎已经失去刚公布戒严令时的那种疑虑感，大小商店又是一派熙熙攘攘的景象。
    下午２时许，以高校学生为主体的游行队伍口号声声，通过长安街绕行天安门广场。这一带交通短时间内受阻。据游行队伍的广播车宣称，这次游行是对海外华人发起的一次活动的响应。
    天安门广场传出的消息说，尽管各地捐赠的一批新帐篷刚刚支起，学生们仍有可能近日内撤走。
    入夜，暑气不退。各路口成了市民们纳凉、聚谈的场所。对北京人来说，歌星演唱会和高水平球赛吸引力似乎已不像以往那样大了。仍然驻扎城外的戒严部队，不断接待被派去的慰问团。一些文艺工作者的演出，在官兵中博得阵阵喝采声。
