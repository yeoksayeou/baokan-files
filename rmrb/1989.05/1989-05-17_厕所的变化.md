These days, the toilets in our residential compound have changed. The excrement is cleaned out every day, and the place is swept spotless.

My wife said, "Now, human waste has become a hot commodity. Every day, there are four or five farmers coming to collect it."

I was puzzled. In previous years, the toilets were almost always full, making the entire compound smell terrible.

Now, why are so many people competing for it?

One Sunday morning, I encountered a farmer pushing a manure cart at the gate.

"Are you a sanitation worker assigned by the sanitation management office?"

"No, I am from Shiqizhuang. I come to collect some manure to fertilize the fields," he replied with a hint of embarrassment.

"Why did you not come in previous years, but now you come so frequently?"

"In the past few years, chemical fertilizers were cheaper. You could buy some, sprinkle it on the fields, and manage to plant crops. Now, chemical fertilizers have become more expensive and harder to buy. It's better to collect human waste from the city to use. Besides, these years of using only chemical fertilizers have made the soil hard and unproductive. If we don't apply some organic manure, the crops will fail."

This farmer's name is Ding Huálǐ. He has a family of five and seven mu of land, four of which are spring fields. Since the beginning of this year, he has been traveling over ten li to the county town to collect manure. One cart of human waste is equivalent to 1,000 kilograms of organic manure. Four carts are enough for one mu of land.

I asked, "Do you have enough organic manure for your own fields?"

Ding Huálǐ became a bit uneasy and hesitated before saying, "Don't laugh at me, but today I am collecting manure for others. I charge 6 yuan per cart, and I have already collected 33 carts for four neighbors. They have some technical skills, so they don't like to do this kind of work, and they find it dirty, so they hire me to do it. I am used to it and don't mind."

"How many people like you are there collecting manure?"

"There are quite a few. In villages like Qili Zhuang, Wuli Dian, Sanli Dian, and Songjia Gou, and around the city of Qixia, at least ten villages have people coming to the city to collect manure. Just in our village, there are over 50 manure carts, most of which were bought this spring. However, with so many people collecting manure, it has become difficult. Sometimes, after visiting six or seven toilets, the manure bucket is still not full. There's no choice but to get up earlier in the morning."

　　厕所的变化
    山东栖霞  牟民文
    这些日子，我们家属院的厕所变了，粪便天天都被掏空，扫得干干净净。
    妻子说：“现在，大粪成了抢手货，每天都有四五个推粪车的农民来收”。
    我很纳闷。往年，厕所几乎天天都是满的，弄得满院臭哄哄。
    现在为什么那么多人抢呢？
    星期天上午，我在门口遇上了一位推粪的农民。
    “你是卫生管理所安排的推粪工吗？”
    “不，我是十里庄的，来推点粪往地里施。”他脸上还有一丝歉意。
    “上几年没有推的，今年怎么来的这么勤？”
    “上几年化肥还贱些，买一点，往地里一洒，凑凑合合种上就行了。现在化肥涨价了不说，还不好买，不如到城里推点人粪尿用。再说，这些年光施化肥，地都发板了，不打粮，再不施点土粪庄稼还要瞎。”
    这位农民叫丁华礼，５口人，７亩地，其中４亩春田。从今年正月初起就开始跑１０多里路到县城推粪。１车大粪可合１０００公斤土粪，１亩地有４车大粪就够了。
    我问：“你家的土粪用得了？”
    丁华礼有些局促不安起来，停了一会儿才说：“不怕你笑话，今天我是给别人推的，推１车６元钱，我已经给４家街坊推了３３车。他们都有点技术活，一来不爱出这力，二来嫌脏，就雇我推，咱干常了不在乎。”
    “像你这样推粪的有多少？”
    “不少，七里庄，五里店，三里店，宋家沟都有，栖霞城周围至少十几个村有进城推粪的，光俺村就有５０多辆粪车，多数是今年春买的。不过，推粪的多了，就难了，有时转六七个厕所挖不满粪桶，没有办法，只好早晨早一点起身。”
