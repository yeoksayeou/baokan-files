The Jixi Mining Bureau's Factory 351 produces an average of 50 tons of mining explosives per day, with a stockpile of over 300 tons at any given time. According to regulations, within a 1,500-meter radius of this explosives warehouse, no human activity should be permitted. However, in 1983, the Chengzihe District Urban Construction Bureau approved the construction of residential houses within this danger zone. Leaders from the municipal government, the mining bureau, and the municipal people's congress have repeatedly proposed that the residential houses must be relocated out of the danger zone, but to this day, nothing has been done. This year, several wells have been built within the explosives warehouse danger zone, with the closest one only 100 meters away from the warehouse.

　　火药仓库险区内　怎么能够建民房
    鸡西矿务局３５１厂平均日产５０吨矿用火药，库存火药量平时达３００吨以上。按规定，在这个火药库１５００米直径范围内不得有人活动，但１９８３年城子河区城建科在险区内批准修建民房。市政府、矿务局和市人大领导同志几次提出民房必须从险区内迁出，可至今未动。今年火药库险区内又建了几个井，最近的离火药库只有１００米。
