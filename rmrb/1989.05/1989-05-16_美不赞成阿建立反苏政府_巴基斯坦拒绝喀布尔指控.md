Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 15th.

The U.S. Secretary of State Baker today, at the "1989 Washington Forum," responded to a question by saying that establishing an anti-Soviet government in Afghanistan does not align with U.S. interests.

Baker stated that the U.S. government is not interested in establishing such a government within Afghanistan.

Baker mentioned that during his visit to the Soviet Union this month, he conveyed the U.S. government's stance to the Soviets.

He said that what truly matters is "allowing the Afghan people to decide their own fate," which aligns with the fundamental interests of the United States.

Baker also accused the Soviet Union of continuing to provide substantial military aid to the Kabul regime. He said that if the Soviets want to help with Afghanistan's reconstruction, they have things they can do.

Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, May 16th.

The Pakistani government once again rejected recent accusations from the Kabul regime that Pakistan is militarily interfering in Afghanistan.

The Pakistani government, in a statement, said that the Kabul regime's accusation on May 2 that the Pakistani government was preparing to send 15,000 soldiers to assist Afghan guerrillas in attacking Jalalabad and Kandahar is absurd and groundless.

The statement said that the Pakistani government has consistently adhered to the Geneva Agreement on the Afghan issue and has been working towards finding a peaceful political solution to the Afghan problem. The Kabul regime's accusation against Pakistan is irresponsible.

    巴基斯坦拒绝喀布尔指控
    新华社华盛顿５月１５日电  美国国务卿贝克今天在“１９８９年华盛顿座谈会”上回答提问时说，在阿富汗建立一个敌视苏联的政府不符合美国的利益。
    贝克说，美国政府对在阿富汗境内建立这样一个政府“不感兴趣”。
    贝克说，他在本月访问苏联时，曾向苏联人表示了美国政府的这一态度。
    他说，真正重要的是“允许阿富汗人民自决”，这才符合美国的根本利益。
    贝克还指责苏联继续向喀布尔政权提供大量军事援助。他说，如果苏联人想对阿富汗的建设有所帮助，他们是有可做的事情的。
    新华社伊斯兰堡５月１６日电　巴基斯坦政府昨天再次拒绝喀布尔政权最近指控巴军事干预阿富汗。
    巴政府在一项新闻公报中说，喀布尔政权５月２日指控巴政府准备派１．５万名士兵帮助阿富汗游击队攻打贾拉拉巴德和坎大哈，是荒谬的和毫无根据的。
    公报说，巴政府始终如一地遵守关于阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议，一直在为寻求一个和平政治解决阿富汗问题的办法而努力。喀布尔政权对巴作出上述指控的行为是不负责任的。
