Chinghiz Aitmatov (1928-) is a master of Soviet contemporary literature. He was born in the Taras mountain area of Kirghizia to a family of farmers and herdsmen. During his youth, he endured hardships and attended a veterinary and agricultural school, working as a village secretary, tax collector, statistician, and technician, among other jobs.

Aitmatov began writing during his student years and published his first novel in 1952. From 1956 to 1958, he studied at the Gorky Literature Institute in Moscow. After graduating, he devoted himself to professional writing. He has authored the short story collection "Tales of the Mountains and Steppes" (including the novella "Jamylia," which won the 1963 Lenin Prize), the novellas "Mother Earth," "Farewell, Gul'sary!" (which won the 1968 USSR State Prize), "The White Ship" (adapted into a film script and won the 1977 USSR State Prize), "The First Swan Geese," "The White Ship," and the novel "The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years" (also known as "The White Steamship," which won the 1983 USSR State Prize). Aitmatov is a writer with a distinct creative personality. He is adept at delicately portraying characters' inner conflicts and psychological development. His works have a broad perspective, clear themes, and are imbued with love for humanity, praising the beauty of the laborers' souls and their spiritual strength. His characters are vivid and moving, and his plots are unique and profound, with beautiful and concise language. His narratives are engaging, filled with the rich atmosphere of life and romantic enthusiasm, and possess a strong national style and lyrical color. He raises sharp moral and social issues. In terms of art, he is not confined to traditional realistic techniques, daring to innovate and create, with his own unique artistic style.

"Jamylia" is Aitmatov's breakthrough work, published in 1958. It was enthusiastically recommended by the veteran Kazakh writer Auezov, and the French writer Aragon praised it as "an unprecedented masterpiece of love." The novel tells the story of a somewhat wild and beautiful Kirghiz woman, Jamylia, who boldly pursues love and happiness. It is a common yet complex issue in life—the conflict between a legal but loveless marriage and an unconventional but pure love. Jamylia, disregarding traditional notions and customs, leaves her unloved husband and joins the disabled soldier Daniyar, who has "only a tattered cloak but is spiritually richer than anyone," and they journey far away together.

Aitmatov's magnum opus, the novel "The Execution Block" (1986), sparked intense debate in the Soviet Union. The work depicts how a she-wolf, Akbara, and her litters all fail to escape human calamities, while humanity ultimately suffers from the she-wolf's mad revenge. A new religious zealot, Avdy, infiltrates an underground organization to fight against drug trafficking and addiction, only to be crucified like Jesus. The author reveals the disasters brought to humanity by the destruction of human and natural ecologies in today's society. This is a masterpiece in the style of a symphony, combining multiple themes, materials, times, spaces, and artistic techniques.

　　苏联当代作家艾特玛托夫
    黎华
    钦吉兹·艾特玛托夫（１９２８—）是苏联当代文学大师。他出身在吉尔吉斯塔拉斯山区的一个农牧民家庭，青少年时期经受了艰苦生活的磨练，曾就学于畜牧兽医学校和农学院，当过村秘书、税收员、统计员、技术员等。
    艾特玛托夫在学生时代就练习写作，１９５２年发表第一篇小说。１９５６至１９５８年在莫斯科高尔基文学院学习，毕业后从事专业创作。他著有中短篇小说集《群山和草原的故事》（包括中篇小说《查密莉雅》，获１９６３年列宁奖金），中篇小说《母亲——大地》、《别了，古里萨雷！》（获１９６８年苏联国家奖金）、《白轮船》（改编成电影剧本获１９７７年苏联国家奖金）、《早来的仙鹤》、《花狗崖》、长篇小说《一日长于百年》（又名《风雪小站》，获１９８３年苏联国家奖金）等。艾特玛托夫是一位具有鲜明创作个性的作家，善于细腻地描写人物内心冲突和心理发展过程，作品视野开阔，主题鲜明，渗透了对人的爱，对劳动者心灵美和精神力量的颂扬，人物形象生动感人，在构思上也很别致，新奇，寓意深远，文笔简洁优美，情节引人入胜，洋溢着浓郁的生活气息和浪漫主义激情，具有鲜明的民族风格和强烈的抒情色彩，提出了尖锐的道德和社会问题。在艺术上他不囿于传统的现实主义手法，勇于开拓和创新，有自己独特的艺术手法。
    《查密莉雅》是艾特玛托夫的成名作，发表于１９５８年，受到哈萨克老作家阿乌埃佐夫的热情推荐，法国作家阿拉贡赞誉它是“一部描写爱情的空前杰作”。小说描写一个带点野性美的吉尔吉斯青年妇女查密莉雅大胆追求爱情和幸福的故事。这是生活中常见而又难解的问题——合法但又无爱的婚姻与违俗但又纯真的爱情的冲突。查密莉雅不顾传统观念和习俗，离开了不爱的丈夫，和“只有一件破大氅”，但“精神上比谁都富有”的残废军人丹尼亚尔结合，远走他乡。
    艾特玛托夫的力作长篇小说《断头台》（１９８６）在苏联引起激烈争议。作品写母狼阿克巴拉生下的几窝狼嵬都没能逃脱人类的浩劫，而人类最终也受到了这头母狼的疯狂报复；新宗教主义者阿弗季打入黑组织，为反贩毒、反吸毒而斗争，结果却像耶稣一样被钉死在十字架上。作者揭示了当今社会人文生态和自然生态被破坏所带给人类的灾难。这是一部多种主题、多种素材、多种时空、多种艺术手法的“交响乐式”的杰作。
