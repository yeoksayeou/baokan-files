There was news that students who had been sitting in at Tiananmen Square were withdrawing to their schools. Later, it was reported that the students would continue their sit-in until June 20. If this information is accurate, it may be intended to exert "influence" or "pressure" on the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which has announced that it will hold a meeting around June 20. If this is indeed the intention, we strongly advise against it.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is convening to discuss issues of concern to the people, including young students, to supervise the government and improve its work. As Chairman Wan Li stated in his written remarks, "To successfully hold this meeting, we must strengthen the concepts of democracy and the rule of law, and we must have a stable and orderly environment. Otherwise, the intended goals will be difficult to achieve." We sincerely hope that the broad masses of young students who are dedicated to promoting democracy and combating corruption can express their opinions through various normal channels to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. It is unnecessary and inappropriate to adopt methods such as mass sit-ins, especially since this method has been ongoing for so long. Although the government has taken a very restrained attitude and the students have paid attention to maintaining order within their ranks, prolonging this situation will inevitably bring more instability and disorder to society, and in practice, it will deprive those who do not participate in the sit-in of their right to use the square.

Now, leaders from various parties and government departments have repeatedly expressed their willingness to address the students' reasonable demands and have repeatedly stated that the partial martial law in Beijing is not directed against the students. We hope that students who are passionate about democratic construction can calmly consider this, quickly end the sit-in at the square, return to their schools, and use normal democratic means and legal channels to advance democratic construction.

    用民主手段推进民主建设
    本报评论员
    前天曾传出在天安门广场静坐的学生有撤回学校的消息。后来，又传出学生将继续静坐到6月20日的消息。此讯如属实，可能是意在对已宣布的于6月20日左右开会的人大常委会施加“影响”或“压力”。如确有此意，则吾人期期以为不可。
    人大常委会开会是要讨论人民群众（包括青年学生）普遍关心的问题，以督促政府改进工作。正如万里委员长在书面谈话中所说的：“要开好这次会议，必须增强民主和法制的观念，必须有一个安定和有秩序的环境，不然的话，预期的目的就难以实现。”真诚希望促进民主、整治腐败的广大青年学生，完全有可能通过各种正常渠道向人大常委会反映自己的意见。不必要也不应该采用聚众静坐之类方式，何况此种方式已持续了这么长时间，尽管政府采取十分克制的态度，学生也比较注意自己内部的秩序，但这样久拖下去，终究要对社会秩序带来更多动荡不安的因素，也在实际上使不参加静坐的人们失去了使用广场的权利。
    现在，党政等各方面领导人一再表示要解决同学们提出的合理要求，一再声明在北京部分地区实行戒严不是对付学生的。我们希望热心于民主建设的同学们也能冷静地想一想，赶快结束在广场上的静坐，撤回学校，通过正常民主的手段，循着法制轨道，来推进民主建设。
