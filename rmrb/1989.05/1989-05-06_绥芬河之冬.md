The Sui Fen River flows eastward from Heilongjiang Province in China, passing through Sui Fen River City, the Soviet city of Ussuriysk, and Vladivostok (Port Arthur), before emptying into the Peter the Great Gulf and the Sea of Japan.

No, the Sui Fen River in winter does not flow. It is frozen, a cold and numb ice river.

The wilderness is vast, the sky is low, and the snow seals everything off. The distant mountains seem smaller. The white hills are delicate and charming. The distant mountains lie silently under the snow. Villages, homes, fields, and forests... seem like strangers gazing at each other from afar, silent and speechless.

The ancient city is silent in its winter slumber.

Surrounded by snow, living in silence, is the heart extremely empty? Snow falls on the lonely city; tears fall on the traveler’s heart?

This is a lonely traveler. A Cantonese man. Xiao Mai, a sales representative from the Guangzhou Electric Rice Cooker Factory. He is not afraid of loneliness and travels thousands of miles from the south to the northern city of Sui Fen River – the terminal station for trains heading to the Sino-Soviet border.

This city is not large. However, compared to the wilderness under Soviet control, it is much more bustling. Even under the snow and ice, there are often horse-drawn carriages running on the snowfields, and fishing and hunting teams drilling holes in the ice to catch fish. In the villages, many people gather around the stove. If you stand on a high point in the city and look far into the distance, you can see the vast and desolate wilderness within the Soviet territory. Occasionally, you might see soldiers from the barracks coming out to change shifts, or a few young Russian women entering and exiting the barracks. The chimneys of the barracks weakly emit smoke, as if sighing or boasting... drifting and disappearing in the cold wilderness.

Ah, a white robe of snow covers the wilderness of two countries.

Xiao Mai is not afraid of having his ears frozen off and is still browsing in the department store. He needs to conduct a market survey for the SYL luxury series electric rice cookers produced by his factory. He sees an elderly white woman who can speak Chinese, sees some beautiful mixed-race people on the street, and hears the powerful Ussuri River Boatmen's Song... a foreign atmosphere. Following history, from nearly a hundred years ago to the early 1950s, the exchanges between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union on the border were frequent. The villages and towns downstream of the Sui Fen River often held friendship dances. Young men living near the border on the outskirts of Sui Fen River City were often invited to participate in dances downstream. Over time, some Russian girls became brides in the Chinese borderlands. Thus, there are white people living in Sui Fen River City, thus there are beautiful mixed-race people, thus there are Russian melodies... thus there is also cultural exchange and trade of goods. In the years when the relationship between the two countries deteriorated, this "heat" was covered by ice and snow, and communication was cut off. However, since there is an inseparable blood relationship, it is difficult to separate it into two unfamiliar worlds. That ancient feeling still exists. It is a heart code that cannot be deciphered by any document.

In recent years, although there has been no formal international trade relationship between the upstream and downstream of the Sui Fen River, the small-scale trade between them that actually takes place is increasing. The SYL luxury series electric rice cookers from the Pearl River Delta's Guangzhou in China, after advancing northward and entering Sui Fen River City, naturally flow through the small-scale trade network on the border to Ussuriysk in the Soviet Union, to Manzhouli, Artyom, Vladivostok, and to Siberia...

The Soviet people originally bought Japanese IHMA electric rice cookers, but now they unexpectedly find that China's "SYL" can match the Japanese "IHMA," and the price is much lower, so they naturally turn to admiring China's "SYL."

Xiao Mai sees that the small-scale trade on the Sino-Soviet border is quite unique, retaining a primitive flavor – barter. Usually, they conduct transactions at the train station in Sui Fen River City. On the ice river, some people still hawk their goods with horse-drawn carriages in the middle of the river. The price has already been agreed upon, and when the two sides' carriages meet, they shake hands, hug, then check each other's goods, then gather around the stove to drink seven or eight bowls of alcohol to keep warm... standing tipsily, saying goodbye intermittently, "See you tomorrow," and then each gets on their carriage and goes their separate ways...

That day, Xiao Mai was favored in Sui Fen River City, perhaps because of the luxurious image of "SYL," Xiao Mai was like a southern angel, and people asked him about the rise of the south, toasted him, and traded "SYL" with him. Xiao Mai asked how many they wanted? The Northeasterners speak frankly, answering, "As many as there are, as many as you want." Xiao Mai was surprised, they want all 900,000 produced by their factory? Not at all. Xiao Mai did not believe it: "How many households are there in Sui Fen River City?" The visitor laughed heartily: "Behind Sui Fen River City, there is a vast Siberia. It is like a big desert. Ten or eighty thousand sent over would be like a small Sui Fen River, disappearing without a trace..."

Xiao Mai exhaled, as if he had walked through the Arc de Triomphe.

Time falls into the black land. This ancient city can no longer be famous for its preserved ancient alleys. The ancient city needs to grow new grass, new groups of buildings, soaring chimneys, luxurious SYL series, and beautiful dreams. The ancient city needs to reshape its image.

The frozen Sui Fen River flows again.

Those beautiful mixed-race people, those white-skinned girls by the Sui Fen River, usually have a hint of coldness at the corners of their mouths, but when they discover this "angel" from the south, they seem to become passionate and gentle...

The south has no ice, no snow. The south is flowing.

Isn't the winter of the Sui Fen River also starting to flow?

　　绥芬河之冬
    杨羽仪
    绥芬河，从中国的黑龙江省向东流，流过绥芬河市，流过苏联的乌苏里斯克城，流过符拉迪沃斯托克（海参崴），流入大彼得湾，流入日本海。
    啊，不！绥芬河的冬天，没有流动。它，凝固了，一条冷得麻木的冰河。
    野旷天低，雪的封闭，四外的犀山显得小了。白色的丘陵玲珑可爱。远山静伏在积雪中，村落、人家、田野、树林……好像一个个陌路人遥遥地对视着，默默无语。
    沉默的古城在冬眠。
    被雪包围着的沉默中，无为地生活着，心中极度地空虚么？雪，落在孤独的城上；泪，落在行旅的心上么？
    这是一个孤独的行旅者。粤人。桂洲电饭锅厂的供销人员小麦。他不怕孤独，万里迢迢地从南国跑到这北国的绥芬河市——火车开往中苏边防线的中方终点站。
    这座城市不大。不过，比起苏联管辖下的那边原野要热闹得多。即使雪压冰封，也常有马车在雪原上跑，有渔猎队在冰河上打冰洞捕鱼哩。村镇里，被白雪覆盖着的屋里，围炉子的也多。倘若站在城的高处远眺，就能看见苏联境内一片原野上，空阔，寂寥，偶尔才见兵营里出来换防的士兵，或许还有几个年轻的俄罗斯女子进出兵营。兵营的烟囱无力地吐着烟，似在唏嘘，似在骄傲……飘飘渺渺的，消散在冷漠的原野上。
    啊，一件雪的素衣，覆盖着两个国家的原野。
    小麦不怕被冻掉两只耳朵，还在百货商场逛。他要对本厂生产的ＳＹＬ豪华型系列电饭锅作市场调查。他看见能操汉语的白种人老妇，看见街上一些漂亮的混血儿，听见那雄浑的乌苏里船夫曲……一种异国的情调。追寻历史，近百年至２０世纪５０年代初，中苏两国人民在边境上的交往是频繁的。绥芬河下游的村落和城镇里的人们，常常举行交谊舞会，住在绥芬河市郊边防线前沿的小伙子常常应邀到下游参加舞会，久而久之，一些俄罗斯姑娘就做了中国边陲的新娘子。于是，便有白种人杂居在绥芬河市，于是有漂亮的混血儿，于是有俄罗斯的歌韵……于是还有各种文化交流，物资交易。到了两国关系恶化的年代，这种“热”被冰雪覆盖了，断了来往。不过既有不可分割的血缘关系，就很难把它分割成两个陌生的世界，那古老的感情还存在。那是用全部文献也无法破译的心灵密码。
    近几年，绥芬河的上下游虽然还没有发生正式的国际贸易关系，但是，他们之间实际上不断进行着的民间小额贸易正在增多。中国珠江三角洲的桂洲ＳＹＬ豪华型系列电饭锅，向北挺进，打进绥芬河市后，就自然通过边防线上的小额贸易网，流向苏联的乌苏里斯克，流向曼佐夫卡、阿尔谢尼耶夫、海参崴，流向西伯利亚……
    苏联人本来买日本的伊玛牌电饭锅，现在意外地发现，中国的“ＳＹＬ”完全可匹敌于日本的“伊玛”，而且价格上低廉得多，自然转而倾慕于中国的“ＳＹＬ”了。
    小麦看见，在中苏边防线上的小额贸易颇为奇特，他们保留着一种原始味——以物易物。平时在绥芬河市的火车站上进行交易。在冰河上，有的人还吆喝着马车在河中心交易。价钱早已默契了，双方的马车一碰头，互相扼扼手，拥抱，然后互相清点货物，然后围起炉子来，喝上七八碗酒驱寒……飘飘然站起来，断断续续地说声：“明天见。”便各自坐上马车分道而去……
    那一天，小麦在绥芬河市受到了青睐，也许由于“ＳＹＬ”的豪华形象，小麦俨然一个南国的天使，人们向他询问南方的崛起，向他敬酒，向他交易“ＳＹＬ”。小麦问要多少？东北人说话豪爽，答曰：“有多少，要多少。”小麦惊讶，他们厂年产９０万个，也要？一点也不含糊。小麦不信：“你绥芬河市多少万人家？”来者哈哈大笑：“绥芬河市后边，还有偌大的西伯利亚，它就像个大沙漠，十万八万个送过去，就像条小小的绥芬河，一下子就渗没得无影无踪……
    小麦呵出一口气，好像走到了凯旋门。
    时光，落进了黑土地。这座古城，不能以保留斑驳的古巷驰名了。古城要长出春草，长出新楼群营，长出冲天的烟囱，长出豪华的ＳＹＬ系列，长出美丽的梦。古城需要重新塑造自己的形象。
    凝固了的绥芬河，它又流动着。
    那些美丽的混血儿，那些绥芬河畔白皮肤的姑娘们，平常嘴角上难免溢着一抹冷淡，但是，当她们发现这个南方来的“天使”，就似乎变得热情而温柔……
    南方，没有冰，没有雪。南方在流动。
    绥芬河的冬天，不也在开始流动了么。
