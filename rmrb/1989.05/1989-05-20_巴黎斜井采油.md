In 1987, geological surveys using seismic methods first indicated that there might be oil deposits beneath the streets of Rue de Lille in the heart of Paris. Subsequent test drilling confirmed this: beneath the bustling streets and colorful squares of the city, there were indeed oil reserves. This capital city of France, with an area of over 100 square kilometers and a population of several million, possesses a significant natural resource in the form of oil beneath its surface. However, in the center of this ancient yet modern metropolis, the juxtaposition of oil derricks with skyscrapers and the roar of drilling machinery with the soft whispers of city dwellers would naturally be discordant.

To develop this resource, French authorities employed advanced inclined well drilling technology, remarkably reducing the aforementioned contrast: the oil extraction site, which should have been in the heart of Paris, was instead located near a subway station on the outskirts. To prevent the noise from the drilling site from disturbing the residents' peaceful lives, all machinery on the site was specially designed to be low-noise, and the site was enclosed with soundproof glass. After all preparations were complete, oil extraction officially began last autumn. The black liquid gold—oil—that was originally beneath the streets of central Paris now flows steadily from the extraction site on the outskirts of the city.

　　巴黎斜井采油
    柳文
    １９８７年，用地震法进行的地质勘探结果最先表明：在巴黎市中心叶利色大街的地下可能存有石油。尔后所进行的试采也得到了证实：在人群熙攘的街道和那些风貌多彩的广场地层下确实有石油的蓄积。这个面积１００多平方公里和拥有数百万市民的法国首都，她地下的那些石油是一笔可观的天然财富。可是，在这个古老而又现代化的大都市的中心，让采油的井架与那些高楼大厦相比衬；让钻机的轰鸣与那些市民们的轻声细语相呼应，自然不太协调。
    为了开发这笔财富，法国有关部门利用斜井采油的先进技术，竟然传奇般地缩小了上述反差：理应规划在巴黎市中心的采油现场，却出现在郊区的一个地铁站附近。为了不让井场的噪音侵扰居民们的宁静生活，井场上一律使用了特制的低噪音机械设备，而且还用防噪玻璃把井场进行了围挡。在准备工作完全就绪后，便于去年秋季正式开机采油了。原本处在巴黎市中心地层下的那些黑色液态金子——石油，现在远离市中心的郊外井场上源源不断地涌流出来。
