Like many developing countries, Pakistan is like a "world automobile exhibition," with various foreign cars running on the streets of its major cities, making it difficult to count their "nationalities." However, in recent years, a type of small, agile, economical car has increasingly appeared in the ranks of automobiles, becoming the largest category by quantity. This is the Pakistani-made Suzuki car. The factory producing this car is known as the "successful enterprise" by the government, paving the way for joint ventures in Pakistan and setting an example.

Before the 1980s, Pakistan had no automobile manufacturing industry and relied entirely on imports. In 1981, the government and Suzuki Company of Japan reached an agreement to establish a factory based on a state-owned automobile repair shop in Karachi. The factory imported technology and equipment from Japan, as well as Suzuki car engines and major components, and began producing "Pakistani-made Suzuki small cars" with Pakistani technicians and workers. After two years of construction, the factory was completed as planned, started trial production in 1983, and officially began production on New Year's Day in 1984, quickly reaching the designed capacity of 24,000 vehicles per year. In recent years, the annual profit rate has consistently remained above 30%.

Today, the Suzuki Car Factory in Pakistan is located on the side of Karachi Port. In a spacious and bright office, the reporter interviewed the factory's general manager, Mr. Shadadulla. This capable entrepreneur first modestly said that Pakistan's automobile industry started late, and there is only one factory that assembles cars, with major components all imported. However, he then seriously said, "Our people also need their own cars." Based on the country's situation, we did not cooperate with companies like Mercedes-Benz of West Germany or Toyota of Japan, but chose Suzuki Company and produced such economical small cars because they have a broad market in Pakistan. Our cars have three major advantages: first, they are cheap, affordable for the middle class; second, they are very fuel-efficient, with 1 liter of gasoline allowing for 20 kilometers of travel, making it affordable for ordinary families; third, after-sales service is comprehensive, maintenance is convenient, and customers can be at ease.

Indeed, the Pakistani-made Suzuki is far from a luxury car, with cylinder capacities of only 800 cc and 1000 cc, and car models including small sedans, shopping cars, vans, small trucks, and soft and hard-top jeeps, with prices ranging from 80,000 to 120,000 rupees (approximately 16,000 to 24,000 yuan). Government officials and all working people in Pakistan drive private cars to work. Generally, government department officials at the bureau level or above, or the wealthy class, do not look at this kind of car. However, those at the section level, university teachers, and newspaper reporters can buy such a car with 2-3 years of savings. Ordinary workers mostly commute by motorcycle. Due to the economic practicality of the Pakistani-made Suzuki, the product is in short supply, and customers have to wait two years after placing an order to take delivery.

The Pakistani government strictly controls the import of luxury cars by government departments or individuals, using the method of imposing heavy tariffs.

　　生产国民买得起的汽车   
     ——巴基斯坦铃木汽车厂采访记
    本报记者  任毓骏
    和大多数发展中国家一样，巴基斯坦也像一个“万国汽车博览会”，在各大城市街头奔跑着形形色色的各国汽车，其“国籍”简直难以统计。但近年来，一种车身短小、机动灵活的经济型小汽车越来越多地出现在汽车队伍中，目前已成为数量最大的车种，这就是巴产铃木车，生产这种汽车的巴基斯坦铃木汽车厂被政府誉为“成功企业”，它为巴基斯坦的合资企业开创了道路，树立了榜样。
    ８０年代以前，巴基斯坦根本没有汽车生产工业，全部依靠进口。１９８１年，政府和日本铃木公司达成协议，在卡拉奇一家国营汽车修配厂的基础上，引进日本的技术和设备，进口铃木汽车发动机和主要部件，由巴基斯坦技术人员和工人生产“巴产铃木小汽车”。经过两年建设，工厂按计划竣工，１９８３年开始试产，１９８４年元旦正式开始生产，很快达到年产２．４万辆的设计要求。近年来年利润率一直保持在３０％以上。
    今天的巴基斯坦铃木汽车厂就座落在卡拉奇海港一侧，在一间宽敞明亮的办公室里，记者采访了工厂总经理沙达杜拉先生。这位精明能干的企业家首先谦虚地说，巴基斯坦汽车工业起步很晚，装配生产汽车的工厂只此一家，而且主要部件全靠进口。但他话锋一转，又严肃地说，我们的人民也要有自己的汽车。根据自己的国情，我们没有和西德的奔驰公司，日本的丰田公司搞合作，而是看中了铃木公司并生产这样经济型的小汽车，就是因为它在巴基斯坦有广阔的市场。我们的汽车有三大优点，首先是价格便宜，中产阶级买得起；其次是特别省油，１升汽油可行驶２０公里，一般家庭养得起；再者是售后服务周全，检修方便，顾客放心。
    的确，巴产铃木远非豪华汽车，汽缸容量仅有８００ＣＣ和１０００ＣＣ两种，车型则有小轿车、购物车、面包车、小货车以及软、硬顶吉普６种，车价在８—１２万卢比之间（约合人民币１．６—２．４万元）。巴基斯坦政府官员以及一切从业人员都开私家车上班，一般来说，政府部门局级以上官员或富有阶层看不上这种车，但处科级、大学教师、报社记者，有２—３年的积蓄即可买这样一辆车。普通工人则以骑摩托上班者为多。由于巴产铃木车经济实惠，产品供不应求，顾客订购后，要等两年才能提到货。
    巴基斯坦政府严格控制政府部门或私人进口豪华小汽车，其手段是征收巨额关税。
