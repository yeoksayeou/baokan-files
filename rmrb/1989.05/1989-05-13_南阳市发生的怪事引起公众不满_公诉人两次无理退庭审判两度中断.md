A strange incident in Nanyang City has caused public dissatisfaction. The public prosecutor twice unreasonably left the courtroom, causing the trial to be suspended twice.

The Nanyang City People's Court recently conducted a closed trial for a "rape and collusion" case. Due to the public prosecutor from the Nanyang City Procuratorate leaving the courtroom twice without reason, the trial, which was proceeding in accordance with the law, was suspended twice and has yet to be concluded.

The case of a defendant accused of "raping a woman" was filed by the Nanyang City People's Procuratorate with the Nanyang City People's Court on July 12th of last year. After reviewing the case materials, the court found the facts unclear and the evidence insufficient, and returned the case to the Nanyang City People's Procuratorate for further investigation on August 15th of the same year. On March 13th of this year, the Nanyang City People's Procuratorate filed a combined case, including the defendant's "collusion" case (which was a case investigated by the procuratorate itself) and the defendant's "rape" case. After reviewing the case, the Nanyang City People's Court decided to hold a closed trial on April 17th.

On April 17th, the court proceeded with the trial as scheduled. At around 3 PM on the 18th, when the defense attorney presented a large amount of evidence, the court asked the prosecutor to cross-examine the evidence. The prosecutor suddenly requested a postponement of the trial. After a discussion, the collegial panel, presided over by the presiding judge, decided to continue the trial, believing the case facts were clear and the evidence sufficient. At this point, the prosecutor, disregarding the court's decision, left the courtroom in anger, causing the trial to be suspended.

Later, after coordination by relevant parties, the court resumed the trial at 9:33 AM on May 3rd. At 9:35 AM, the court, in order to further clarify the case, lawfully summoned the first witness to the courtroom. As the witness was about to take the stand, the prosecutor from the Nanyang City Procuratorate requested to speak. Given that the witness was entering the courtroom, the presiding judge asked the prosecutor to wait. At this point, the prosecutor, without giving any reason, shouted "retreat, retreat, retreat" and left the courtroom again, causing the lawful trial to be suspended for the second time. The prosecutor's blatant disregard for the court has caused widespread dissatisfaction among people from all walks of life.

　　南阳市发生的怪事引起公众不满    
    公诉人两次无理退庭审判两度中断
    本报讯  河南省南阳市法院日前在不公开审判一桩“强奸、包庇案”过程中，由于南阳市检察院派出的公诉人两次无理擅自退庭，致使这一依法进行的正常审判两度中断，至今仍无结果。
    某被告“强奸妇女”一案于去年７月１２日由南阳市人民检察院向南阳市人民法院提起公诉，经市人民法院审理原卷材料，认为事实不清，证据不足，于同年８月１５日退回南阳市人民检察院补充侦查。今年３月１３日，南阳市人民检察院又将该被告“包庇”一案（系该检察院自侦案件）和该被告“强奸妇女”一案合并一案起诉。经南阳市人民法院审查后，决定于４月１７日开庭不公开审判。
    ４月１７日，法院如期开庭审理此案。１８日下午３时许，当辩护人宣读了大量证据，法院请公诉人对上述证据进行质证时，公诉人突然提出延期审理的要求。在审判长主持下，合议庭经合议后，认为本案事实清楚，证据充分，作出继续庭审的决定。这时，公诉人不顾法院决定，拂袖而去，无理退庭，致使此案审理被迫中断。
    后来，经有关方面协调，５月３日上午９时３３分，法庭继续开庭审理。９时３５分，法庭为了进一步查清案情，依法传唤第一个证人到庭。在证人还未走到证人席时，南阳市检察院派出的公诉人要求发言。鉴于证人正在进庭，审判长请公诉人稍等。这时，公诉人竟不讲任何理由，连声高喊“退庭、退庭、退庭”，又一次拂袖而去，致使这次依法进行的正常审判再一次被中断。公诉人这种公然藐视法庭的行为，引起各界人士的普遍不满。
