I read the letter to the editor published on the sixth page of your newspaper on April 12th, titled "This Type of Street Vendor Should Be Strictly Rectified, Not Allowed to Tarnish the Capital." I salute the reporter and the editor!

On the afternoon of April 8th, I took my grandson to watch a movie at the Beijing Zoo. As we passed by a watermelon stand, my grandson wanted to eat some honeydew melon. A woman in her thirties who was selling the melon cut a piece for him and handed it over. My grandson took it and started eating. The woman then used a calculator and said, "1300 grams, 11.93 yuan." I was a bit suspicious. Such a small piece of melon weighing over a kilogram? I asked her to weigh a slightly larger piece. "650 grams," she said it was a kilogram scale. Just as we were talking, a few people gathered around, all talking at once, saying, "Old man, if you can't afford it, don't interfere!" After arguing for a while, seeing how fierce they were, I could only admit my bad luck.

Two passersby advised me, saying: "These vendors are all fearless; you can't afford to provoke them!" I think that if we don't make a big decision to clean them up, they will find another way to tarnish the capital. If you don't believe it, just wait and see!

　　希望继续报道查处结果
    读了你报４月１２日第六版刊登的信访调查《这类摊商应严加整顿，不许他们给首都抹黑》，我向记者、编者致敬！
    ４月８日下午，我带着外孙去看环视电影，路过动物园瓜摊，外孙要吃哈密瓜。一位３０多岁的女商贩给称了块瓜，随手去皮一大片，孙子接过就吃上了。女商贩拿计算器一按说：“１３００克，１１．９３元”。我有点犯疑，那么一点瓜１公斤多？我就要她称块比我孙子吃的那块大一些的。“６５０克。”她说是公斤秤。正说着，围上几个人，七嘴八舌地说：“你老头吃不起就别打岔！”争执一会，见他们那么凶，我只好自认倒霉。
    有两位过路人劝我说：这些摊贩都有恃无恐，你惹不起！对这伙人，我看如不下大决心清理，他们还会换个花样给首都抹黑。不信，等着瞧！
