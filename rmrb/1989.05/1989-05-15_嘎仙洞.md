In the heart of the original forest of the Greater Khingan Range, there is a cave known as the Gaxian Cave. It is an ancient stone chamber where the ancestors of the Tuoba Xianbei tribe once resided.

The Gaxian Cave is located 25 meters up on the southern slope of a towering rock mountain. The rhombus-shaped cave entrance is prominently open, and the cave itself is deep, giving off an awe-inspiring and somewhat terrifying religious atmosphere. The cave is 90 meters long from north to south, 40 meters wide from east to west, and 20 meters high, capable of accommodating over a thousand people. At the northern end of the main cave, there are two smaller caves in the stone wall, which are believed to have been the bedrooms of the tribal chiefs. The giant stone at the cave entrance is said to be the reviewing platform.

On July 30, 1980, archaeologists discovered a stone inscription at the western entrance of the cave. This inscription, recorded in the "Book of Wei" under the "Rites," was written by the Middle Secretary Li Chan during a sacrificial ceremony in the fourth year of the Tai Ping Zhen Jun era (443 AD). The inscription is written vertically, with a total height of 70 centimeters and a width of 120 centimeters. It consists of 19 lines, 12 complete lines, each containing 12 to 16 characters, and the remaining lines are half lines, serving as a heading and title. The characters are in the style of the Wei Dynasty, with a strong clerical script influence, appearing ancient and robust. The entire text contains 201 characters.

For many years, historians have been researching and exploring but have not been able to locate the stone chamber. The discovery of the stone inscription proves that the "Great Xianbei Mountain" is indeed the Greater Khingan Range, the ancestral home of the Tuoba Xianbei. The relics of the Xianbei people not only conclusively demonstrate that this region has been part of China since ancient times but also hold significant historical and academic value in the study of the origins of the Xianbei people and the history of China's borders.

In recent years, experts, scholars, poets, writers, artists, and tourists have been flocking to the Gaxian Cave in the Greater Khingan Range to explore its ancient mysteries.

　　嘎仙洞
    吴春甫
    在大兴安岭原始森林腹地有个嘎仙洞，它是拓跋鲜卑祖先居住的旧墟石室。
    嘎仙洞在一座突兀石山南坡的２５米高处，菱形洞口赫然地张着，洞里深邃，给人一种威严恐怖的宗教气氛之感。洞南北长９０米，东西宽４０米，高２０米，可容纳千余人。大洞北端的石壁上，还有两个小洞，可能是酋长的卧室。洞口的巨石，据说是点将台。
    １９８０年７月３０日，考古工作者在洞的西侧入口处，发现了《魏书·礼志》所记载的中书侍郎李敞来致祭时“刊祝文于室之壁”的石刻祝文。这石刻祝文，诞生于太平真君四年（公元４４３年）。刻辞为竖行，通高７０厘米，宽１２０厘米，共１９行，１２个整行，每行１２至１６字不等，余为半行，为抬头另行与题名。汉字魏书，隶意浓重，古朴雄健，全文２０１字。
    多少年来，历史学家们考证，探索，一直没有找到石室。石刻祝文的发现，证明了“大鲜卑山”即大兴安岭就是拓跋鲜卑的发祥地。鲜卑人的遗迹不仅确凿地证实了这一带自古以来就属于中国，而且对研究鲜卑民族起源、中国疆域史具有重大意义和学术价值。
    近年，前来大兴安岭嘎仙洞访古探幽的专家、学者、诗人、作家、画家和观赏者络绎不绝。
