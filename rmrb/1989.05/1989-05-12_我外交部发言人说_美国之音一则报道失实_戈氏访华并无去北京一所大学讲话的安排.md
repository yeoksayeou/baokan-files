Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Says U.S. Voice of America Report is Inaccurate: Gorbachev's Visit to China Does Not Include a Speech at a Beijing University

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 12 — Our reporter learned today that the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated here today that the Voice of America's report that the Chinese government rejected Soviet leader Gorbachev's request to speak at a university in Beijing is "groundless."

A reporter asked: Recently, the Voice of America reported that Gorbachev expressed interest in speaking at a university in Beijing, but this was rejected by the Chinese government. Please confirm.

The Foreign Ministry spokesperson replied: The Voice of America's report is groundless. The two sides have never discussed this matter. In the jointly agreed schedule for Gorbachev's visit to China, there is no such arrangement.

　　我外交部发言人说
    美国之音一则报道失实
    戈氏访华并无去北京一所大学讲话的安排
    新华社北京５月１２日电  本社记者今天获悉，中国外交部发言人今天在这里说，美国之音报道中国政府拒绝苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫想去北京的一所大学发表讲话的要求，是“毫无根据”的。
    有记者问：最近，美国之音报道说，戈尔巴乔夫表示对去北京的一所大学发表讲话有兴趣，但是遭到中国政府拒绝。请予证实。
    外交部发言人回答说：美国之音的这个报道毫无根据。中苏双方根本没有谈过这个问题。在中苏双方共同商定的戈尔巴乔夫访华的日程中没有你所说的那种安排。
