On the afternoon of January 21, at around 5 PM, teacher Chen Yingmou from our school boarded the 412 train from Guangzhou to Hengyang. At around 4 AM on January 22, as the train was approaching Liuzhou Station, a group of thugs threatened Chen with knives and stole over 1,000 yuan from him. After the thugs left, Chen immediately reported the incident to the train's staff. One of the staff members said, "There is only one police officer on the train. Wait until we reach Liuzhou Station to report it."

At around 4:40 AM, the train arrived at Liuzhou Station. Chen hurriedly got off the train and ran to the railway police station to report the case. The duty officer said, "We don't handle investigations. Go find the police squad!" Chen managed to find the police squad, but the duty officer snapped, "We don't handle investigations now. Come back at 9 AM!" At around 8 AM, Chen again requested to report the case. A police officer said, "We don't handle investigations. Go find the investigation team!" After several attempts, Chen finally found the investigation team and pleaded, "I don't have any money left. If you can recover the money, I'll give you half as a reward." A police officer said, "We'll do our best to investigate. However, the chances of solving the case are slim. There are many such robbery cases, and some cases are even bigger. Some murder cases can't even be solved." Chen's heart sank.

　　车上受劫遭厄运    
    乘警推诿人心凉
    １月２１日下午５时，我校教师陈应谋在河唇车站登上广东湛江开往湖南衡阳的４１２次列车。２２日凌晨４点左右，列车快到柳州站时，一伙歹徒用匕首逼着陈老师，抢走了陈老师随身携带的１０００多元人民币。这伙歹徒离开后，陈老师立即向列车乘务员报案。一位乘务员说：“列车上只有一名乘警，等到柳州站你去报案吧！”
    凌晨４点４０分左右，列车到达柳州站。陈老师急忙下车跑到铁路派出所报案。派出所值班员说：“我们不管破案，去找乘警队！”陈老师好不容易找到乘警队，值班的同志没好气地说：“现在不办案，到９点钟再来！”８点钟左右，陈老师又一次要求报案，一位乘警说：“我们不管破案，去找破案组！”陈老师辗转几次找到破案组，哀求说：“我身上一分钱也没有了，要是能把钱追回，我拿一半酬劳你们。”一位乘警说：“我们尽量侦破就是了。不过，破案的希望不大，这类抢劫案很多，有的案子比你的大得多，有的人命案都破不了。”顿时，陈老师心凉了半截。
