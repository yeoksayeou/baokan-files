The Intermediate People's Court of Weifang City, Shandong Province, has issued a regulation: all the banners and plaques hanging on the walls of the system should be removed, regardless of whether they were issued by higher authorities or donated by the public. This court is a model unit commended by the Supreme People's Court of China. In recent years, due to their adherence to legal procedures in handling cases, they have gained the love and respect of the public, and the number of banners and plaques has gradually increased. In the context of building a clean government, this court believes that too many honors are not conducive to strengthening internal construction and may lead to complacency among officials. Therefore, they proposed not to hang the image of the People's Court on the wall but to establish it in the hearts of the people, and made the decision to remove the plaques.

The spirit of the Intermediate People's Court of Weifang, which does not seek empty fame and does not engage in superficial work but instead diligently serves the people, is truly commendable. Of course, I am not advocating that everyone should follow suit and remove their banners and plaques. However, I am reminded of the units that issue, donate, and send banners. How much energy and money have been wasted? After all, these expenses are not paid out of their own pockets. Perhaps this is why the trend of giving banners has become increasingly prevalent. The fabric of the banners has changed from silk to satin, and then to velvet. The certificates have also changed from glass frames to large plaques with Kambala stone quartz clocks embedded in them, costing anywhere from a few dozen to over a hundred yuan each. How necessary is all this? Everything has its limits. If banners and plaques become too common, they will also lose their value.

　　收旗摘匾
　　李乐平
    山东潍坊市中级人民法院作出一条规定：将本系统所有挂在墙上的锦旗牌匾全部摘下来，不管是上级发的还是群众送的。这个法院是受全国最高人民法院表彰的先进单位，近几年来，由于他们依法办案，受到群众的爱戴，锦旗和奖匾渐渐多了起来。在廉政建设中，这个法院认为，荣誉多了不利于加强自身建设，容易使干部产生自满情绪，所以他们提出：不把人民法院的形象挂在墙上，而树立在人民的心目中，作出了摘匾的决定。
    潍坊中级人民法院不图虚名，不做表面文章，扎扎实实为群众办事的精神实在可敬。当然我也不是主张大家都来收旗摘匾。不过我却想到那些授锦旗、赠锦旗、送锦旗的单位，空耗了多少精力，浪费了多少钱财，反正这些费用不是自己掏腰包。也许正因为如此，锦旗之风愈刮愈烈，面料由府绸变软缎，软缎又变成平绒，奖状也由玻璃镜框变为镶嵌着康巴丝石英钟的大牌匾，一块少则几十元，多则上百元，究竟有多大必要？凡事都要有个“度”，锦旗奖匾发泛了，也会贬值的。
