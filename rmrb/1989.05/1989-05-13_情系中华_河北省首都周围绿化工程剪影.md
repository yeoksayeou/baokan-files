The destruction of vegetation has put Beijing under the threat of sandstorms!

As early as August 1977, at the World Desert Conference held in Kenya, Beijing was listed as an area affected by sandstorms. More seriously, the groundwater level has been continuously declining. From 1970 to early 1986, the groundwater level in Beijing had cumulatively dropped by 9.97 meters, making it difficult for residents to access water.

Given this severe situation, the Party Central Committee proposed: By the end of this century, we must fundamentally change the environment around the capital. A major battle to greenify Beijing and protect the capital, with the cities of Chengde, Zhangjiakou, and Tangshan in Hebei Province as the main focus, has been fully launched. Over the past three years, more than 6.4 million mu (approximately 426,000 hectares) of trees and grass have been planted, with a survival rate of over 70%. A faint green line is quietly extending around Beijing...

Returning to the Barren Mountains

In the barren hills of Sanyipeng Township, Weichang County, Hebei Province, a wisp of smoke is rising. This place is about ten li (approximately 5 kilometers) away from the village, and the vast valley is filled with the howling of cold winds. A young man with disheveled hair walks out from the bushes. He is very happy to see us and insists on inviting us into his house. He moves aside a bamboo fence, revealing a dark, damp cave. He leads the way with a flashlight, and we crawl along the stone walls, quickly reaching the bottom of the cave. It turns out to be a damp, dark underground cellar.

"Please sit down." A quick-witted young woman quickly brings over a quilt and spreads it on the edge of the kang (a traditional Chinese heated bed), asking us to sit down. She then says, "I've had bad luck following him. Our family originally had three large brick houses, with a separate courtyard. Although we weren't millionaires, we had enough to eat and drink. But he insisted on leasing this 4,000-plus mu of barren land, and in an instant, our good home was sold."

The young man is named Guan Fuku, and the woman is his wife. Their young daughter is studying in the village, and the couple have been living in the cave for over three years. The difficulties seem to have passed, and he lights a cigarette, exhaling thick smoke as he slowly says, "To do business, one must make some sacrifices. I used the money from selling our home to buy saplings and hire people to dig tree pits. Now, all 4,000-plus mu of larch trees have survived. In a few more years, this mountain will yield 30 million yuan worth of timber annually. Whether the money is much or little is a small matter. The important thing is that we are leaving a green mountain for future generations."

There are many others like Guan Fuku who have leased barren land and lived in the mountains. In this township alone, there are three households leasing over 3,000 mu, not only planting trees but also earning some income. Little Guan earns over 1,000 yuan a year from selling grass and saplings.

"Green Factories" Spread Across the Countryside

On the hills of Hongshiyaji Village, Qian'an County, a group of young women dressed in colorful clothes are pruning branches and singing while climbing the fruit trees.

This village has 48 households, and most of the men have gone to work in factories. The remaining women in the village quickly come down from the trees and gather around us, chattering excitedly.

They call this fruit tree hill a "green factory." A few years ago, after the village's farmland was expropriated, only 600 mu of barren land was left unused. Some suggested dividing the compensation money from selling the land; others wanted to leave Hongshiyaji and move to another village. The cadres discussed repeatedly and decided to use tens of millions of yuan from the land expropriation to build an orchard on the barren land and plant "money trees."

The young women, with a determined spirit, managed to dig "mountain-turning terraces" that are each 1 meter wide and deep on the 600 mu of barren land. They built four water reservoirs on the mountain top and laid over 10,000 meters of underground pipes. Then, they planted various fruit trees on the newly leveled land. The first year they planted trees, the third year they began harvesting. In 1985, the densely planted red fruits yielded over 700 kilograms per mu. In 1988, the entire village earned 1,133 yuan per person from the "green factory," surpassing the wages of miners.

They calculated that if they built an iron ore processing plant with an annual output of 50,000 tons, the annual net income would be 400,000 yuan. If they built a 200-mu orchard, a few years later, the annual income would also be 400,000 yuan. Thus, a 600-mu fruit tree hill is equivalent to building three black factories.

In the course of the greenification project around the capital, various counties in Tangshan City have built such "green factories" on the former barren hills, which not only have the protective functions of fixing sand, retaining water, and conserving soil but also have economic benefits. Last year, after four hours of rain in Shitizi Gorge, Qian'an County, with a rainfall of 104 millimeters, there was no soil erosion due to the construction of the green factory. The northern counties of Tangshan have planted crops such as soybeans and peanuts in the newly built mountain-turning terraces, effectively increasing farmland by over 40,000 mu and harvesting over 3 million kilograms of soybeans and other grains. Some have recovered their investments in the same year, so these "green factories" quickly spread across the countryside.

To Avoid Carrying the Burden of History

"In the past few years, I have been determined to focus on forestry. I want to greenify the remaining 280,000 mu of barren land in Zhangjiakou during my term to contribute to the capital and leave a lasting memorial for the local people."

He is Wang Quan, a national model worker in forestry and the executive vice mayor of Zhangjiakou.

Last August, after studying for half a year at the Central Party School, he returned and went to Chicheng first instead of going home to understand the progress of the greenification project there. Later, due to a heart attack, he returned to Zhangjiakou. However, time waits for no one, and missing the tree-planting season would delay the progress of afforestation by a year. To boost the morale of the county and township leaders, he led a team to visit Chengde for a study tour. Chengde is a mountainous area, and all the sites to be visited require climbing mountains. Before each climb, he had to take two "heart pills." In this way, supported by medication, he led everyone to visit for six consecutive days. A large-scale autumn afforestation campaign quickly unfolded across the region.

In the greenification project around Beijing and Tianjin, there are many leaders like Wang Quan. In Yongquan Township, Yuxian County, there is a township party committee secretary named Zhang Zhe. During the county people's congress, he was unanimously elected as a deputy county magistrate. However, when the county committee urged him to take up his post, he submitted a resignation letter, saying, "Yongquan Township has been included in the greenification project around the capital. We plan to plant another 10,000 mu of timber, 10,000 mu of nuts, 10,000 mu of fresh fruits, 10,000 mu of pines, and 10,000 mu of grass. Without completing these five '10,000 mu,' I will not leave Yongquan." Some people called him a "big fool" and a "hypocrite," but he replied with a smile, "I am not a fool. If I can create a forest for Yongquan, it will be more glorious and solid than being a 'county magistrate.'"

    ——河北省首都周围绿化工程剪影
    刘芳
    由于植被的破坏，北京，面临风沙的威胁！
    早在１９７７年８月，在肯尼亚召开的世界沙漠会议上，北京就被列入受风沙侵害的范围。更为严重的是地下水位不断下降，从１９７０年至１９８６年初，北京市地下水潜水位已累积下降９．９７米，居民吃水也面临困难。
    鉴于这样严峻的形势，党中央提出：力争在本世纪末彻底改变首都周围环境，以河北省承德、张家口、唐山三个地市为主体的一场绿染京华、保卫首都的战斗全面展开。３年多来，已造林种草６４０多万亩，成活率均在７０％以上。一道依稀可见的绿色，正悄悄地在北京周围延伸……
    重回荒山
    在河北省围场县三义永乡的荒凉山岗上，有一缕炊烟在飘荡。这地方距村庄有十几里，空旷的山谷只有寒风在呜呜作响。一位蓬头垢面的小伙子从柴草丛中走来。他见了我们很高兴，非要叫屋里坐一会。他搬开一块用草编的篱笆，一条黑乎乎的地道出现在眼前。他用手电在前边带路，我们猫着腰，手扶着石壁，很快爬到洞底。原来这是一处像猫耳洞那样潮湿黑暗的地窖。
    “快请坐”。一位快言快语的青年妇女很快抱来一床棉被，铺到炕沿上，叫我们坐下，然后说：“我跟着他算倒八辈子霉了。俺家原来有三间大瓦房，独门独院。虽算不上万元户，但有吃有喝。可他非要承包这４０００多亩荒山，一下子把好端端的一个家全卖了。”
    这青年叫关福奎，女人是他的妻子。他们的小女儿正在村里念书，小俩口已在地穴里居住３年多了。困难似乎已经过去，他点燃一根香烟，一边吐着浓浓的烟雾，一边缓缓地说：“搞事业就得做出点牺牲。我把变卖家业的钱用来买树苗，雇人挖树垵，现在这４０００多亩落叶松全部成活，再过十几年，这片山年年都能给我产３０多万元的木杆。钱多钱少事小，更重要的是我们给后代留下一座青山。”
    像关福奎这样承包荒山后到山里穴居的人还有许多，光这个乡承包３０００亩以上的就有３户，不但种上了树，还有了一定的收入。小关每年打草、卖树苗就收入１０００多元。
    “绿色工厂”遍山乡
    在迁安县红石崖村的山坡上，一群花枝招展的姑娘，正攀在果树上，一边修枝剪杈，一边唱歌。
    这个村共有４８户，男人们大都进了厂，村里剩下的全是妇女。见我们走来，几个戴着耳环的姑娘很快从树上下来，围住我们叽叽喳喳地说个不停。
    她们把这座果树山称为“绿色工厂”。几年前这个村的耕地被征用后，只留下６００亩荒山没人要。有的说应把卖地的钱分光；有的想离开红石崖到外村去住。干部们反复琢磨，决定用几十万征地款在荒山建果园，栽上“摇钱树”。
    姑娘们憋着一口气，硬是在６００亩荒山上，挖满了宽深各１米的“围山转”，在山顶上修了４个水囤，铺了１万多米地下管道，然后在新挖的水平地上栽上各种果树。头年栽树，第三年就开始收获了。１９８５年春密植的红果，去年亩产７００多公斤。１９８８年全村人均从“绿色工厂”中分红１１３３元，超过了矿山工人的工资。
    他们算了一笔帐，若办一个年产５万吨的铁选矿，年纯收入可达４０万元，若建２００亩果园，几年后年收入也是４０万元。这样，６００亩果树山就等于建３个黑色工厂。
    唐山市各县在开展首都周围绿化工程中，在昔日的荒山上建起了一座座这样的“绿色工厂”，既有固沙蓄水保土的防护作用，又有经济收益。去年迁安县石梯子沟下了４个小时的雨，降水１０４毫米，由于建了绿色工厂，没有发生水土流失现象。唐山北部的几个县，在新开的围山转内间种粮食，如大豆、花生等，相当于净增农田４万多亩，收获黄豆等杂粮３００多万公斤。有的当年就收回投资，因此这种“绿色工厂”很快遍布山乡。
    为了不再背历史的包袱
    “这几年我是铁心抓林业了。我要在任职期间内把张家口地区还剩下的２８００亩荒山全部绿化，为首都做点贡献，给当地群众留下永久纪念。”
    他，就是全国林业劳动模范、张家口行署专员王权同志。
    去年８月，他在中央党校学了半年后回来，不去家门先到赤城，了解那里的绿化工程有何进展。后来因为心脏病发作，才回张家口。但时光不等人，错过造林季节就得耽误一年的造林进程。为了鼓舞地、县领导们的士气，他带队去承德参观学习。承德是山区，所有的参观点都得爬大山，每次爬山前，他都得先吃两片“救心丸”。就这样，靠药支撑着，他带着大家一连跑了６天。一个大规模的秋季造林高潮很快在全区展开。
    抓京津周围绿化工程中，像王权这样的带头人，还有很多。蔚县涌泉乡有一位乡党委书记叫张铎，县里开人代会时，一致推选他为副县长。但县委催他去上班时，他却递上了辞职申请，他说：“涌泉乡已列入首都周围绿化工程，我们计划再造１万亩用材林，１万亩干果，１万亩鲜果，１万亩松，１万亩草，不完成这５个‘１万’，我不离开涌泉。”有人说他是“大傻帽”、“假正经”，但他却笑着回答：“我不傻。如果我能给涌泉造出一片森林，比当‘县太爷’还要美气、踏实。”
