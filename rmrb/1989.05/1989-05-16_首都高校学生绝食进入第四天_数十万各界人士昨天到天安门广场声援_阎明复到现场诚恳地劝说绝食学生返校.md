	BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) — The hunger strike by capital university students entered its fourth day today. Hundreds of thousands of people from various sectors gathered at Tiananmen Square again to support the students' demands.

	In the morning, a group of university teachers joined the hunger strike, visiting their students. Some elderly professors embraced students lying on the ground, tears streaming down their faces.

	Many government agencies, research institutions, and news organizations in the capital spontaneously formed support groups, marching from all directions to Tiananmen Square. The banner carried by the group from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences read: "Support the students, save the students," "Accept the conditions, engage in equal dialogue." Some staff from various news and publishing units in the capital also participated in the march, chanting slogans such as "We cannot stand by and watch the students starve to death."

	Groups composed of staff from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the Chinese Writers' Association, the Ministry of Petroleum, and other departments entered the square one after another. Members of the China Democratic League, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and the China Zhi Gong Party also came to support the students.

	Many students who came to show their support collected donations for the hunger-striking students. Some artists even sold their paintings on the square to raise funds. People continuously brought in drinks and medicine to the hunger-striking students.

	A spokesperson for the hunger-striking students said at a press conference held on the spot that the petitioning students would not change their demands: the central government should clearly affirm that this student movement is a patriotic democratic movement; the top leaders of the central government should quickly engage in open and equal dialogue with the students.

	As of the time of publication, more than 600 out of the over 3,000 hunger strikers had fainted. More than ten hospitals provided medical care for these students.

	At 5:40 PM, Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, came to the square and sincerely persuaded the hunger-striking students to return to school. He said, "Students are the future of the country, and you have no right to harm your own bodies." He hoped that everyone would stop the hunger strike and return to school as soon as possible.

	Today, some university leaders, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and leaders of democratic parties expressed their sincere hope that the students would stop the hunger strike through various means.

    本报北京五月十六日讯  首都高校学生绝食请愿今天进入第四天，数十万各界人士再次聚集天安门广场，声援绝食学生的请愿要求。
    上午，一批高校教师进入绝食队伍中，慰问自己的学生。有的老教授拥抱着卧倒在地上的学生，痛心地流下了眼泪。
    首都许多机关、科研、新闻单位的工作人员自发组成声援队伍，从四面八方游行至天安门广场。中国社会科学院游行队伍携来的横幅上写着：“声援学生，救救学生”，“接受条件，平等对话”。首都许多新闻出版单位部分人员也参加了游行声援，他们边走边呼喊“不能坐视学生饿死”等口号。
    由全国总工会、中国文联、中国作协、石油部等部门一些工作人员组成的队伍相继进入广场，民盟、民革、九三学社等民主党派部分人士也前来声援学生。
    许多前来声援的大学生四处为绝食学生募捐，有的画家还在广场为学生作画义卖。送饮料与药品的人员不断进入绝食队伍中。
    绝食学生的一位发言人在现场举行的新闻发布会上说，请愿学生不会改变自己的要求：中央明确肯定本次学生运动是爱国民主运动；中央最高领导迅速与学生进行公开的平等对话。
    截至发稿时，三千多名绝食者中已有六百多名晕倒。十多家医院为这些学生提供了医护。
    下午五时四十分，中共中央书记处书记阎明复来到广场绝食学生当中诚恳地劝说绝食的学生返回学校。他说，同学们是国家的未来，你们没有权利伤害自己的身体。他希望大家停止绝食，尽快返回学校。
    今天，一些高校负责人、全国政协委员、民主党派负责人通过各种方式，恳切希望学生停止绝食活动。
