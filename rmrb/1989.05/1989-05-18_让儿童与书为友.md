In recent years, the number of child readers worldwide has decreased, and the sales of children's books have declined, leading to a shrinking market. Professor Carla Poesio, an expert in children's literature and advisor to the Bologna Children's Book Fair, pointed out this worrying trend when she was interviewed by our reporter.

The Bologna Children's Book Fair is said to be the largest children's book fair in the world today. The 26th fair, held in early April this year, featured 999 publishers from 54 countries and 179 publishers from the host country. China International Bookstore and three Chinese publishers also participated in the exhibition.

Professor Poesio said that the above situation is due, on the one hand, to the decrease in birth rates. For example, in Italy, the population growth rate is nearly zero, and the number of school-age children has significantly decreased. On the other hand, children spend less time reading books, have more extracurricular activities, and especially spend too much time watching television. The main goal of this year's Bologna Children's Book Fair is to encourage children to read, to make children friends with books, and to find joy in reading.

Professor Poesio believes that from this fair, we can see the following main features and development trends in the current world of children's book publishing: First, there is an increase in toy books. Books are made into various shapes of animals or trains, airplanes, cars, robots, etc. The main target audience is preschool children. The goal is to help children transition from toys to books, from playing with stuffed animals that move with hands to playing with books that move with imagination. This visual education is an important stage in children's education. Creating toy books is much more difficult than making toys, but it can cultivate the interest of young readers in "playing with books." For this purpose, there are various types of plastic books, books that float on water, and books that are not afraid of being bitten. Second, there is the development of pocket-sized books. Books should be a "daily necessity" for children, and every effort should be made to cultivate children's reading habits. Affordable and high-quality pocket-sized books provide great help in this regard. Children like pocket-sized books and can carry them wherever they go, which is very convenient. Third, there is an emphasis on popular science books. From history to technology, from art to sports, combining reality and interest, through illustrated popular science books, attracting young readers with "fun knowledge."

At the fair, Chinese children's books were praised for their unique selection of materials and illustrations, such as "A Magnificent Brocade" and "Seven Precious Stones" by Dolphin Press, and "Chinese Folk Tales" by the Chinese Children's Press, which were well-received by the audience. However, compared to other countries, there are noticeable gaps: the paper and printing quality are relatively poor, the cover design and binding are generic, and the foreign language fonts are outdated. Stefano, the chairman of the Bologna Fair, believes that if China can tap into its rich cultural resources, then China's children's book publishing industry will achieve tremendous development.

　　让儿童与书为友
    本报记者  罗晋标
    近年来，世界上儿童读者减少，儿童书籍销量下降，市场缩小。儿童文学专家、意大利波伦亚儿童书籍博览会顾问卡尔拉·波埃西奥教授在接受记者采访时一开始就指出这种令人忧虑的情况。
    波伦亚儿童书籍博览会据称是当今世界规模最大的儿童书籍博览会，今年四月上旬举办的第二十六届博览会，有五十四个国家的九百九十九家出版社和东道国的一百七十九家出版社参展。中国国际书店和三家中国出版社也参加了展览。
    波埃西奥教授说，上述情况的出现，一方面是由于人口出生减少，例如意大利，人口增长率已近于零，学龄儿童明显减少；另方面是由于孩子们看书的时间少，课余活动多，特别是看电视的时间太多。本届波伦亚儿童书籍博览会的主要目标即是鼓励儿童读书，让儿童与书为友，以读书为乐。
    波埃西奥教授认为，从本届博览会可以看出当前世界儿童书籍出版的以下主要特点和发展趋势：首先是玩具书的增加。把书制作成各种动物或火车、飞机、汽车、机器人等形状，其主要对象是学龄前儿童，其目的是要帮助儿童实现从玩具到书的过渡，使儿童从玩用手使之动作的布制动物过渡到玩以想象使之动作的书上画的动物，这种形象教育在儿童教育中是一个重要的阶段。这种玩具书的创作要比玩具的制作难得多，但它可以培养小读者“玩书”的兴趣。为此目的，还有各种各样的塑料书、浮在水上的书、不怕咬的书等。其次是袖珍书的发展。书应当是儿童的一种“日常用品”，要想方设法培养儿童的读书习惯，而价廉物美的袖珍书为此提供了很大的帮助，孩子们喜欢袖珍书，走到哪里就带到哪里，十分方便。第三是知识普及读物的加强。从历史到科技，从艺术到体育，把现实性和趣味性结合起来，通过带图的普及读本，以“好玩的知识”吸引小读者。
    在博览会上，中国儿童书籍以其选材、绘画的中国特色受到好评，例如海豚出版社的《一幅壮锦》、《七颗宝石》和中国少年儿童出版社的《中国民间故事》等，受到观众的欢迎。但与其他国家比较，有明显的差距：纸张和印刷质量较差，封面设计和装帧一般化，外文本字体陈旧。波伦亚博览会主席斯泰法尼认为，如果中国能发掘其丰富的文化资源，那么中国的儿童书籍出版工作将会取得巨大发展。
