Egypt to Attend Arab Summit

CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will attend the special Arab summit scheduled for May 23 in Casablanca, Morocco.

Mubarak made an unannounced lightning visit to Jordan and Iraq yesterday. Upon his return to Cairo last night, he told the press that Egypt had received the notice to attend the summit. Saudi Arabia, the Gulf Cooperation Council member states, and the vast majority of Arab countries have agreed to Egypt's participation in this summit.

He said he had exchanged views with Jordan's King Hussein and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and reached a consensus on the "form" of Egypt's return to the Arab League and his attendance at this summit.

Egypt's first deputy foreign minister, Bassiouny, announced in Aqaba, Jordan, that Egypt would participate in the upcoming Arab summit.
