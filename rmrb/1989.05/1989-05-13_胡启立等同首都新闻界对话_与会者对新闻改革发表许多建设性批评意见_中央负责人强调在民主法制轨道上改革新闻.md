Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th.

Hu Qili, a member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, along with Secretariat members Rui Xingwen and Yan Mingfu, and Propaganda Department head Wang Renzhi, held discussions with editors, reporters, and leaders from Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, Guangming Daily, and China Youth Daily from May 11th to 13th.

Hu Qili and other leaders also invited the heads of more than ten major news organizations in Beijing for a discussion and listened to the opinions of some experts and professors from the Beijing news theory community.

During the discussions, attendees shared their views on recent student protests and news reporting issues and offered many constructive suggestions for China's democratic and legal system building and news reforms.

Hu Qili and others listened carefully to the attendees' opinions, thanked everyone for their criticism and suggestions, and frankly shared their own views. They believe that news reform, as an important part of political system reform, has reached a critical point where it must be undertaken. The attitude towards news reform must be resolute, and the steps must be steady. Problems must be solved within the framework of democracy and the rule of law. The drafting of the news law will strictly follow legislative procedures and will involve extensive democratic discussions. It is necessary to seriously review and summarize China's news work, seeking updates and improvements in ideological concepts, management systems, leadership methods, and dissemination methods. There must be increased openness and transparency to truly achieve the goal proposed in the report of the 13th Party Congress: "To inform the people of major situations and to let the people discuss major issues." In the framework of democracy and the rule of law, we must steadily push forward news reforms.

The discussions over the past few days were conducted in an atmosphere of sincerity and harmony. Everyone agreed that such discussions increased mutual understanding and were active and beneficial.

It is reported that the discussions will continue.
