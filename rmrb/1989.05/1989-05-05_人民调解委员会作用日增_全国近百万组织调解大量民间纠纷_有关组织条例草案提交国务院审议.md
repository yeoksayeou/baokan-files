The role of People's Mediation Committees is increasingly significant. Nearly a million organizations across the country mediate a large number of civil disputes. The draft regulations for these organizations have been submitted to the State Council for deliberation.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 5th, Deputy Minister of Justice Lu Jian said at the 40th meeting of the State Council today that China's People's Mediation Committees have played an active role in maintaining social stability and unity, protecting citizens' legal rights, building socialist spiritual civilization, and promoting economic development. They are a distinctive feature of China's legal system construction.

Lu Jian explained the draft "Regulations on the Organization of People's Mediation Committees" during the meeting. He said that since the State Council issued the "Provisional Regulations on the Organization of People's Mediation Committees" in 1954, by the end of 1987, over 980,000 People's Mediation Committees had been established in urban and rural areas nationwide, with more than 6 million mediators. From 1981 to 1987 alone, these committees mediated over 47 million civil disputes, preventing more than 600,000 potential homicides, fights, and suicides.

He pointed out that the draft "Regulations on the Organization of People's Mediation Committees" was formulated based on the new situation and extensive consultations with relevant departments, experts, scholars, and grassroots cadres and the masses. The draft regulations, based on the Constitution and laws, stipulate that People's Mediation Committees should be established under urban Residents' Committees and rural Villagers' Committees.

Lu Jian said that according to the draft regulations, People's Mediation Committees should follow these principles when mediating civil disputes: mediation should be conducted in accordance with national laws, regulations, policies, and relevant rules; mediation should be based on the voluntary and equal participation of the parties involved; mediation is not a necessary step in litigation. The focus of the mediation work will be on preventing the escalation of civil disputes. The work of the People's Mediation Committees will be guided by local governments and local people's courts.

Lu Jian also explained other issues in the draft regulations, such as the scope of disputes that People's Mediation Committees can mediate.

　　人民调解委员会作用日增
    全国近百万组织调解大量民间纠纷   
    有关组织条例草案提交国务院审议
    据新华社北京５月５日电  司法部副部长鲁坚今天在国务院第４０次常务会议上说，我国的人民调解委员会组织，对维护社会安定团结，保护公民合法权益，建设社会主义精神文明和促进生产发展发挥了积极作用，是一项具有中国特色的法制建设。
    鲁坚今天在会议上就提请审议的《人民调解委员会组织条例（草案）》作说明时说，我国在１９５４年由政务院颁布《人民调解委员会暂行组织通则》以后，截至１９８７年底，全国城乡已建立人民调解委员会９８万多个，共有调解人员６００多万人。仅１９８１年至１９８７年，这些调解委员会就调解各类民间纠纷４７００多万件，防止可能引起的凶杀、械斗、自杀案件６０多万起。
    他指出，《人民调解委员会组织条例（草案）》是为适应新的形势，在广泛征求中央有关部委和研究部门的专家学者以及基层干部、群众意见的基础上制定的。《条例（草案）》依据宪法和法律，规定在城市居民委员会和农村村民委员会下设立人民调解组织。
    鲁坚说，按照《条例（草案）》，人民调解委员会调解民间纠纷应遵守的原则是：依照国家法律、法规、政策和有关规章进行调解；调解应在当事人自愿平等的基础上进行；调解不是诉讼的必经程序。人民调解工作将把预防民间纠纷激化作为工作的重点。人民调解委员会的工作受基层人民政府和基层人民法院的指导。
    鲁坚还就这一《条例（草案）》中关于人民调解委员会调解纠纷的范围等问题作了说明。
