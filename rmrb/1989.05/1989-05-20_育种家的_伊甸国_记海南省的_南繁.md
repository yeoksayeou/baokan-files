Breeders' "Eden" - A Record of Hainan Province's "Southern Breeding"
By Liú Héng, People's Daily Reporter

	Extending the Life of Scientific Research

	Like bees seeking flowers and swallows chasing spring, every early winter, breeders from all over the country rush to the southernmost part of Hainan Province—Sanya City and the Lǐzu Autonomous County of Lèdōng and Língshuì.

	Here, it is summer all year round, and there are no typhoons. Breeders plant various types of rice, corn, wheat, sorghum, cotton, watermelon, rapeseed, and other crops on the warm land. By February of the following year, they start transporting the harvested seeds back to the north, just in time for spring planting.

	Seeds are the intrinsic factor for plant yield increase; breeding new varieties is a breeder's lifelong career. Located in the temperate zone, China's seeds generally only reproduce one generation per year, and selecting a new variety takes seven to eight years, or even a decade or more. However, by going to the subtropical Hainan Province for "southern breeding" and adding generations, seeds can be harvested two or three times a year. Selecting a new variety only takes five to six years.

	One year can be used as two or three, and two or three years of work can be completed in one. The breeding cycle is shortened, and breeders travel back and forth between the north and south, but their scientific research life is enriched and extended.

	Improving Seed Quality

	It's not just that. "Southern breeding" can also break through seed quality. Breeders from Xinjiang have a particularly deep understanding of this.

	Hainan Province is hot, humid, and has less sunlight, with severe pests and diseases, which is the opposite of Xinjiang. Under these two completely different natural conditions, the seeds bred can grow in both places, naturally have strong vitality, wide adaptability, good resistance, and great potential for yield increase. For example: corn, since it can withstand the pests and diseases in Hainan Province, it will be even more resilient when returned to Xinjiang. Cotton, which has already stabilized in Xinjiang, when tested in Hainan Province, some varieties mutate, then they are eliminated, and those seeds that are insensitive to light and temperature, and do not mutate are selected. Hàn Xīnchéng and Shàng Jūnhuá, a couple of agronomists from the Agricultural Science Institute of the 10th Division of the Agricultural Corps in Ālētaí, have been participating in "southern breeding" since 1964 and have successively bred the famous Āchūn No. 1, 2, and 3 spring wheat. No. 1, after only one round of "southern breeding," could only increase yield in the Ālētaí region. No. 2, after two rounds of "southern breeding," could also increase yield in regions like Tǎchéng. No. 3? After four rounds of "southern breeding," it could even rank at the top in the Hétián region.

	"Southern breeding," known internationally as "heterotopic accelerated breeding," is stronger than breeding in only one location. Dr. Borlaug of the United States left his wife and children to go to Mexico. Why did the high-yielding, disease-resistant, dwarf Mexican wheat he bred almost establish itself globally? It's because Borlaug utilized different weather and environmental conditions to conduct 30 years of heterotopic breeding, doubling the yield of wheat.

	The Secret of the "Father of Hybrid Rice"

	Hybrid vigor is a universal phenomenon in the biological world. To increase grain yield, seeds must be hybridized. Japan started researching hybrid rice in the 1950s, but the results are still not significant. In China, research began in the 1960s, and in 1981, it won China's top invention award. Yuán Lóngpíng was called the "Father of Hybrid Rice." What's the secret? It turns out that since 1968, Yuán Lóngpíng and other breeders from Hunan have been going to Hainan Island for "southern breeding" every year. In 1970, they discovered a type of wild rice in a marsh in Sanya City, which was the male-sterile wild rice they had been looking for for many years. They quickly conducted "southern breeding" and accelerated the generations. In just three years, they achieved the three-line system of sterility, maintainability, and restorability. In 1973, they continued "southern breeding" and accelerated seed production. In 1976, they began promoting it. Thus, China's rice yield greatly increased, taking the lead in the world.

	The role of "southern breeding" is immeasurable and cannot be replaced by any artificial greenhouse or climate chamber. Many agriculturally developed countries have long known this, and they are willing to spend huge sums of money to establish their own breeding bases in the tropics.

	Promote Scientific Research and Develop Hainan

	Chinese breeders do not need to go abroad to conduct "southern breeding." People flock to it.

	The people of Hainan Island are complaining: "So many people come to the end of the earth, they will push us into the sea!" The breeders are also complaining: "Southern breeding is difficult and troublesome! Finding accommodation is hard, farming is like guerrilla warfare, 60% of the time and energy is not spent on breeding, but on oil, salt, firewood, and rice." Plus, in the same area, everyone does their own thing, forces are scattered, and topics are repeated.

	"There must be a unified and powerful leadership!" The "southern breeding" command center of Hainan Island was established, and the command centers of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions were also established. They unanimously decided: "Southern breeding," with scientific research and breeding as the main focus. Seed production and expansion, except for what is necessary, should be done at home, where the land is vast. As for seed production for the purpose of making money, it is not welcome at all.

	The work of the Xinjiang "southern breeding" command center is commendable. They review topics, reduce the area, and streamline personnel. Since 1979, they have selected the Lìzhīgōu Division Farm as a permanent base, building offices, dormitories, canteens, and drying grounds. Most of the personnel live together. There are vehicles for transportation and logistics for supplies, and breeders can focus on scientific research without being distracted by trivial matters of life.

	"Flowers blooming inside the wall should also be fragrant outside!" Some people began to combine their own topics, helping farmers identify seeds, plant off-season watermelons, and other fruits, develop regenerated rice, cultivate tomatoes that are suitable for storage, solve the problem of eating vegetables in the off-season... Zhang Ēnfú, a female agronomist from the Hāmì Melon and Fruit Research Center in Shànshàn County, Xinjiang, has conducted multiple rounds of "southern breeding" to cultivate Hāmì melons that can resist pests and diseases, and has also found ways to make Beijing melons take root in the south. She said: "Hainan supports our 'southern breeding,' and we should also do our best to develop Hainan."

	Facing New Challenges

	After Hainan Island became a province, a large number of people rushed in, and many works could not keep up, plus a series of national social problems, the "southern breeding" work is currently facing great difficulties. For example: first, rent is out of control. In the 1970s, it was about 70 yuan per mu, now it has risen to 760 yuan. Second, prices are soaring. Agricultural and living materials are very expensive. Third, everything requires money to get things done. There are many checkpoints in the work, and many departments need to be given gifts, treated to meals, and entertained. Fourth, social security is extremely poor. Property is often stolen or robbed, crops are eaten by pigs and cows, and even some personnel are injured.

	No wonder Yuán Lóngpíng had to shout loudly: "China's current grain situation is very severe, and just importing grain costs 5 billion US dollars. We are researching the second-generation hybrid rice breeding system. If successful, these 5 billion US dollars can be saved. To accelerate the pace of scientific research, we must fully utilize Hainan, this natural large greenhouse. However, now people cannot work here in peace, and even personal safety is not guaranteed. How can 'southern breeding' work continue?" It's time to pay attention to Yuán Lóngpíng's call!

　　育种家的“伊甸国”
    ——记海南省的“南繁”
    本报记者  刘衡
    延长了科研生命
    像蜜蜂寻找花朵，燕子追逐春天，每年初冬，全国各地的育种家们奔向海南省的最南边——三亚市和乐东、陵水黎族自治县。
    这里四季皆夏，没有台风。育种家们在暖融融的土地上，种下各种型号的水稻、玉米、小麦、高粱、棉花、西瓜、油菜……第二年２月开始，把收的种籽陆续运回北方，正赶上春播。
    种籽是植物增产的内因；培育良种是育种家的终身事业。地处温带的我国，种籽一般一年只繁殖一代，选育一个新品种要七八年、十几年。而到亚热带的海南省去“南繁”、加代，种籽一年可收两代、三代。选育一个新品种只要五六年。
    一年能当两年、三年用，两三年的工作一年做。育种周期缩短了，育种家南北奔忙，科研生命却充实、延长了。提高了种籽质量
    不仅仅如此。“南繁”能使种籽在质量上有所突破。新疆的育种家们对此体会特别深。
    海南省高温、湿润、日照少，病虫害严重，刚好与新疆相反。在两种截然不同的自然条件下，培育出的能在两地生长的种籽，自然生活力强、适应性广、抗逆性好、增产潜力大了。例如：玉米，既然能抗住海南省的病虫害，回到新疆，更不在话下。棉花，在新疆已经性状稳定了，到海南省一试，有的发生变异，那么，就把它淘汰了，选用那些对光、温反应迟钝、不发生变异的种籽。韩新城、尚君华夫妇是阿勒泰农１０师农科所的农艺师。从１９６４年开始双双参加“南繁”，先后培育了有名阿春一、二、三号春小麦。一号只经过一次南繁，只能在阿勒泰地区增产。二号经过两次南繁，还能在塔城等地区增产。三号呢？经过四次南繁，竟能跑到和田地区去名列前茅。
    “南繁”，在国际上叫“异地加代育种”，比只在一地育种强。美国的布鲁格博士别妻离子，跑到墨西哥，他培育的高产、抗病、矮秆的墨西哥小麦为什么几乎能立足全球？就因为布鲁格利用了不同的气象、环境，搞了３０年的异地育种，把小麦的产量提高一倍。
    “杂交水稻之父”的奥秘
    杂种优势是生物界的普遍现象。粮食要增产，种子要杂交化。日本对杂交水稻的研究，５０年代就开始了，但至今成果不大。我国呢，６０年代才开始研究，１９８１年获得我国特等发明奖，袁隆平被称为“杂交水稻之父”。其中有何奥妙？原来是以袁隆平为首的湖南育种家们从１９６８年开始，年年到海南岛“南繁”。１９７０年，他们在三亚市的一片沼泽地上发现了一种野生稻，这是他们找了多年一直找不到的雄性不育的野生稻。赶紧南繁加代，仅仅３年，就实现了不育、保持、恢复三系配套。１９７３年又连续南繁，加速繁殖制种。１９７６年开始推广。于是，我国水稻大大增产，处于世界的领先地位。
    “南繁”的作用是无法估计的，也不是任何人工温室、人工气候箱所能代替的。许多农业发达国家早就知道这一点，他们不惜花费巨资到热带建立自己的繁育基地。
    突出科研　开发海南
    我国的育种家不出国门，就能“南繁”。人们蜂拥而至。
    海南岛的人民在叫苦：“那么多人来天涯海角，要把我们挤下海了！”育种家们也在叫苦：“南繁南繁又难又烦！住宿找房难，种地打游击，６０％的时间、精力不搞育种，搞油盐柴米。”加上同一个地区，人们各搞一套，力量分散，课题重复。
    “必须要有统一的强有力的领导！”海南岛的南繁指挥部成立了，各省、市、自治区的指挥部也成立了。一致决定：南繁，以科研、育种为主。制种扩繁，除必要的外，其余回家作吧，那儿天地广阔。至于以赚钱为目的的制种，一律不欢迎。
    新疆南繁指挥部的工作是值得称道的。他们审查课题，缩小面积，精简人员。从１９７９年开始，选定荔枝沟师部农场作为永久性基地，建了办公室、宿舍、食堂、晒场。大部分人员住在一起。运输有车辆，供应有后勤，育种家们一心一意搞科研，不为生活琐事分心。
    “墙里开花要里外香啊！”有些人开始结合自己的课题，帮助农民鉴定种籽、种植西瓜等反季节瓜果，搞再生稻利用，培育耐贮藏的西红柿，解决淡季吃菜……新疆吐鲁番地区鄯善葡萄瓜果研究中心的女农艺师张恩福为了培育能抗病虫害的哈密瓜，多次进行南繁，还想方设法让北京瓜果在南方生根。她说：“海南支援我们南繁，我们也要为开发海南尽力。”
    面临新的困境
    海南岛建省后，大量人员涌进，许多工作跟不上去，加上全国性的一系列社会问题，南繁工作目前碰到极大困难。例如：一、地租失控。７０年代每亩７０元左右，现已涨到７６０元。二、物价猛涨。农用物资、生活物资都十分昂贵。三、一切要用钱才能开路。工作中关卡很多，要给许多部门送礼、请吃、招待。四、社会治安极差。财物经常被偷、被抢，作物被猪啃牛吃，甚至有的人员被打伤。
    无怪乎袁隆平要大声疾呼了：“我国的粮食现状十分严峻，光进口粮食就要花费５０亿美元。我们正在研究杂交水稻二系配套工程。如果成功，这５０亿美元就省下来了。要加快科研步伐，就要充分利用海南这个天然大温室。可是，现在人们无法在这里安心工作，甚至连人身安全都没有保障，南繁工作怎么能坚持下去呢？”是到了重视袁隆平呼声的时候了！
