Historically renowned and famous far and wide, the Chinese cultural gem "Maotai" is now on thin ice. Facing the crisis, Zou Kailiang, Director of Guizhou Maotai Liquor Factory, appeals to the macro-decision-making departments.

Liquid Funds Dried Up

Maotai Liquor Factory, which once brought great honor to the country and contributed nearly 100 million yuan in taxes, is now facing severe financial difficulties due to the state's tightening of credit. In 1988, the factory's loan plan was 26.5 million yuan, and in 1989, the working capital needed was 41.4 million yuan. To date, the factory has not received a single yuan of the required funds for these two years.

As the national liquor, "Maotai" undergoes two rounds of raw material input and seven rounds of brewing, featuring a long cycle and high-quality requirements. This year, Maotai Liquor needs 1,700 tons of grain, but currently, there are only 400 tons available. If loans are not obtained in a short period and raw materials cannot be purchased, more than a thousand tons of national liquor will become a mere discussion on paper. If calculated at the selling price, the loss to the state would reach 260 million yuan.

"Seeing the enterprise in this situation, I can't eat or sleep well, and the pressure is immense," said Zou Kailiang. "Currently, the state's efforts to regulate the economic environment are undoubtedly correct. However, the macro-control departments need to be decisive in raising and lowering the 'sluice gates' and implement a policy of differentiated treatment, with both support and pressure. A 'one-size-fits-all' approach can only suppress the potential of state-owned backbone enterprises, ultimately causing huge losses to the state's finances."

Mandatory Raw Materials Unavailable

Guizhou Province is a major grain-deficient area. Renhuai County, the main raw material base for Maotai Liquor Factory, will see a grain reduction of 20 million kilograms this year, with a deficit of 25 million kilograms. By April, Maotai Liquor Factory had only received 2 million kilograms, and there is no solution for the remaining grain.

Zou Kailiang's expression was somber as he said, "The state has a mandatory allocation plan for famous liquors (200 tons for foreign trade and 450 tons for domestic sales in 1989), but we cannot obtain the raw materials needed to guarantee this mandatory plan. Although through various efforts, on April 10, we organized 10,000 kilograms of wheat in Wuhan, it was seized again after being loaded onto the train, citing 'no state allocation order'! A skilled cook cannot make a meal without rice. For a month, our factory has stopped production for 35 days due to a lack of raw materials, and if this continues, we will have to stop production again."

The High Price of National Liquor is Deterring

Maotai Liquor Factory is facing another major impact: since last year, the state has implemented a new high-pricing policy for famous cigarettes and liquors, causing "Maotai" sales to plummet.

In the spring trade fair of 1988, Maotai was priced at $15 per bottle, and in the autumn trade fair, it reached $33 per bottle. Several dozen customers from nine countries hesitated and did not dare to place orders. The domestic market is similar: in the autumn trade fair of 1987, 145 dan were ordered, but in the spring trade fair of 1989, only 50 dan were ordered.

This representative of the 7th National People's Congress and the first outstanding entrepreneur of Guizhou Province suggested, "The macro-control departments of the state should enhance the democracy and science of decision-making. Before making major decisions, they should first widely listen to the opinions of enterprises and hear the voices of entrepreneurs. Making decisions based on the arguments of a few people and 'armchair strategizing' can lead to disastrous consequences, and the losses can be immense after trying to 'cover the hole after the sheep has escaped.'"

With a 2,000-year history, "Maotai" is a pride of Chinese culture. Promoting traditional Chinese culture is a sacred mission for every "Maotai" person. The state's ban on using Maotai Liquor at national banquets last year was understood by Zou Kailiang. He proposed a win-win strategy, which was moving and showed the sincere heart of the "Maotai" people: "The national liquor should be placed in its rightful position. We are willing to provide it for national banquets free of charge or at half price, so that foreign dignitaries and people from all walks of life in China can taste 'Maotai.' This is the glory of several generations of 'Maotai' people and the pride of the Chinese people. Why let this opportunity slip away from us?"

　　“茅台”告危
    ——贵州省茅台酒厂厂长邹开良呼唤录
    张忠武
    历史悠久、名闻遐迩的中国文化精英——“茅台”，今天如履薄冰。面对危机，贵州省茅台酒厂厂长邹开良向宏观决策部门发出呼唤。
    流动资金枯竭
    曾为国家赢得巨大声誉，上缴利税近亿元的茅台酒厂，由于国家抽紧银根，企业资金严重不足：１９８８年工厂贷款计划２６５０万元，１９８９年流动资金需４１４０万元。迄今为止，两年所需要的资金，企业未获分文。
    作为国酒的“茅台”，要经过２次投料、７次烧酒的“全路”，具有周期长、特性要求高的特色。今年，茅台酒的粮食投料需１７００吨，现在仅有４００吨。如果短时间内得不到贷款，买不到原料，那么逾千吨国酒将成为纸上谈兵。若按销售价格计算，给国家造成的损失将达２．６亿元。
    “看到企业处于这种境地，我每天吃不好，睡不着，压力极大。”邹开良说：“当前国家治理经济环境，无疑是正确的。但是，宏观控制部门既需要果断升降‘闸门’，又需要有的放矢，实行区别对待、有保有压的倾斜政策。‘一刀切’只能遏制国营骨干企业应有的潜力，最终给国家财政造成巨大损失。”
    指令性原料毫无保证
    贵州省是“缺粮大户”，作为茅台酒厂主要原料基地的仁怀县，今年粮食将减产２０００万公斤，缺粮２５００万公斤。至４月，茅台酒厂仅拿到２００万公斤，所差的粮食没有着落。
    邹开良神情慽慽，说：“国家对名酒有指令性调拨计划（１９８９年外贸２００吨，内销４５０吨），但是，我们根本拿不到确保指令性计划所需的原料。虽然通过种种努力，４月１０日我们在武汉组织了万斤小麦，谁知，粮食上了车皮又被扣下，说是“无国家调拨令！”巧妇难为无米之炊啊。一月以来，我厂因缺原料已停产３５天，照此下去还要停产。”
    国酒巨价　令人生畏
    茅台酒厂面临着另一个大的冲击是，国家自去年对名烟名酒实行新的昂价后，“茅台”销量骤减。
    １９８８年春季交易会，茅台每瓶１５美元，秋交会高达３３美元。９个国家的几十名客商望而却步未敢订货。国内也是如此：１９８７年秋交会订出１４５担，而１９８９年春交会只订出５０担。
    这位全国七届人大代表、贵州省首届优秀企业家建议：“国家宏观控制部门应增强决策的民主性与科学性。作重大决策前，应首先普遍地听取企业的意见，倾听企业家的呼声。仅凭少数几个人的论证与‘纸上谈兵’，便作决策，造成恶果后再去‘亡羊补牢’，损失往往不可估量。”
    具有２０００年历史的“茅台”，是中国文化的骄傲，弘扬传统的中国文化，是每一个“茅台人”神圣的使命。国家去年实行禁止在国宴上使用茅台酒，邹开良理解国家的初衷。他提出了一个两全之策，慷慨感人，显示了“茅台人”的赤诚之心：“国酒，应该放到她应有的位置。我们愿意无偿或半价提供给国宴使用，让外国贵宾、国内各阶层人民一饮“茅台”，这是几代“茅台人”的光荣，也是中国人的自豪。为什么让这种机会与我们失之交臂呢？”
