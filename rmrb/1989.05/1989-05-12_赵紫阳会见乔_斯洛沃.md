Zhao Ziyang Meets Joe Slovo

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 12th — Reporter Wen Xian reports: CCP Central Committee General Secretary Zhao Ziyang met with a delegation led by South African Communist Party General Secretary Joe Slovo this afternoon in Zhongnanhai.

	Zhao Ziyang, on behalf of the CCP Central Committee, welcomed General Secretary Slovo's visit to China. Slovo briefed on the situation of the South African people's struggle against racism.

	Zhao Ziyang said that currently, the overall international situation is showing a trend of easing. Political solutions are emerging in regional hotspots. This situation is beneficial to the South African people. At present, the easing of the situation in Southern Africa and the beginning of Namibia's independence process are mainly the results of the long-term struggles of the Southern African people, and are also inseparable from the international context. For Namibia to fully achieve independence, there may still be some twists and turns and difficulties, but achieving independence is the trend of the times and is irreversible.

	Zhao Ziyang also said that the South African Communist Party has, for decades, persisted in the struggle against the apartheid system, and we firmly support this. Our party also supports the efforts of the Southern African people and relevant parties, as well as the United Nations, in resolving the Southern African issue.

	CCP Central Committee member and head of the International Liaison Department Zhu Liang, and deputy head of the International Liaison Department Jiang Guanghua, participated in the meeting.
