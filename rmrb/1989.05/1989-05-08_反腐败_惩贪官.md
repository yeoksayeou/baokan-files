An official in charge of a region, and moreover a poor region, took advantage of a work transfer to accept banquets and gifts, spending over 5,000 yuan of public funds, causing a very bad impression among the people. Now, this "banquet official" has finally been punished. This is a specific action in our fight against corruption and punishment of corrupt officials.

An official is someone who holds power and leads the people. The ancients said, "If officials are not upright and fair, then governance declines," "The country's decline is due to corrupt officials." Whether an official is clean or not is of great importance to the country and the people. "The rats in the official granary are as big as fighting cocks," "Three years as a clean magistrate, ten million silver taels," in the old society, corrupt officials were everywhere. Entering the new society, the Communist Party and the people's government have always taught and called on our cadres to be clean and upright officials, and indeed, a large number of officials like Jiao Yulu and Yu Jie have emerged. The vast majority of our cadres are clean, which is unprecedented in our country's history. However, it must be admitted that officials who are greedy or waste public funds still exist. Although they are few in number, they are like tumors on the body, causing great harm to the Party and the country. If we do not remove these tumors and eliminate corrupt elements, the Party will have no peace, and the country will have no peace.

What is alarming is that some of our comrades, especially some comrades in important leadership positions, do not fully recognize the harm caused by corrupt officials and other corrupt elements, and do not strike hard enough. They often use various seemingly reasonable excuses to exonerate these people, and when they cannot exonerate them, they handle them lightly, or try to protect these people's positions, or try to ensure that these people's material lives are not affected. During the investigation of Wei Mingcheng, someone stood up to plead for him and even "protect" him, which illustrates this point.

The Chinese people hate corrupt officials the most and love clean and upright public servants the most. This is completely consistent with the stance of our Party and government. If our reforms are to deepen and our cause is to advance, we must resolutely carry out the fight against corruption and punishment of corrupt officials.

A tree rots from the inside before insects infest it. If we do not fight against corruption vigorously and handle corrupt elements leniently, it is equivalent to destroying our cause.

### 反腐败　惩贪官

　　反腐败　惩贪官
    一个地区的专员，而且是贫困地区的专员，趁工作调动之机四处吃请受礼，耗费公款５０００多元，在群众中造成很坏影响。如今，这个“吃喝专员”终于受到惩处。这是我们反腐败、惩贪官的一个具体行动。
    官者，掌权率众之人也。古人云：“吏不廉平，则治道衰”，“国家之败，由官邪也”。为官是否清廉，于国于民关系极大。“官仓老鼠大如斗”，“三年清知府，十万雪花银”，在旧社会，贪官比比皆是。进入了新社会，共产党、人民政府一直教导和号召我们的干部做清正廉洁的“官”，也确实涌现了一大批像焦裕禄、喻杰那样的“官”。我们绝大多数的干部是清廉的，这在我国历史上是从来没有过的。但是，毋庸讳言，贪财或挥霍公款的“官”仍未绝迹。这些人虽为数极少，但如同人体上的痈疽，对党和国家危害极大。不去掉这些痈疽，不清除腐败分子，党无宁日，国无宁日。
    值得警惕的是，我们一些同志，特别是某些担负重要领导工作的同志，对贪官等腐败分子的危害认识不足，打击不力。他们常常以各种似是而非的理由来为这些人开脱，实在开脱不了时就从轻处理，或者尽量保这些人的官，或者尽量保这些人的物质生活不受影响。魏明生被查处过程中有人站出来为他说情甚至“保驾”，就说明了这一点。
    中国老百姓最恨贪官，最爱清正廉洁的公仆。这同我们党和政府的立场是完全一致的。我们的改革若要深化，事业若要推进，必须坚定不移地进行反腐败、惩贪官的斗争。
    木先朽而后虫生。对腐败现象斗争不力，对腐败分子查处手软，就无异于葬送我们的事业。
