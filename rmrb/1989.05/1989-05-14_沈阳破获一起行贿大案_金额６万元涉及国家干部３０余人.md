    A major bribery case involving 60,000 yuan has been uncovered in Shenyang, with over 30 state officials implicated. The suspects, Yang Renlong, Zhang Yinfu, Wang Zhiguo, and others, have been arrested.

    According to reports, the case involves more than 30 officials from state organs, including one vice-district level official and seven officials at the deputy director and director levels.

    Yang Renlong and Yang Renjie are the manager and deputy manager of the Dongfang Cooperation Fast Food Shop in Shenyang's Shenhe District (a private enterprise). Since July 1987, the Yang brothers, during the development of a section of Yongle Lane on Shenyang Road in Shenhe District in collaboration with the Shenyang City Construction Credit Union, bribed Wang Zhiguo, the deputy director of the City Construction Branch Office, Zhang Yinfu, the director of the Joint Construction Office, and Guan Huaihan, the deputy director of the Municipal Civil Defense Office, with cash, video recorders, color TVs, gold jewelry, and refrigerators. After receiving the bribes, these officials opened channels and made efforts on multiple fronts, not only allowing Yang Renlong to obtain tens of millions of yuan in funds but also enabling him to fraudulently obtain the position of vice-chairman of the Shenyang Dongfang Children's Art Foundation.
