	Youth
		Laoyu

	Under the flickering light of a kerosene lamp, I finished reading "The Forest and the Plain" at the age of 13. My soul was pure and untainted. In the distant northern land that my imagination could not reach, the life journeys of Xiaojianbo and Bai Ru ignited the flames of youth within me... The romantic tales of battle and the pure, gentle waves of love amidst the pine forests of the Great Northern Wilderness enticed me with their fresh allure. A force surged within me, a longing rose from my heart. In a daze, I galloped across the snowfields, I was Xiaojianbo, and Bai Ru was my eternal beloved in my dreams... Blowing out the lamp, sitting on the kang in the countryside, I was enveloped by the heavy darkness. An indescribable voice enshrouded me, it made my soul overflow from my body, attempting to break through the fear that surrounded me; this voice grew closer, assaulting me, everything around me ceased to exist, I seemed to be at the edge of the world, my life ebbing away in this suffocating atmosphere... What made me afraid? What was changing me? The night connected me with something mysterious, who am I, and who is me?

	Mother said, "You were born on the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month in 1963, in the year of the Rabbit." I knew I had been living in this world since I was four.

	Grandpa's back, Mother's embrace, the flower beds in the courtyard. Riding on Grandpa's back, I saw one person after another pass by me, they were just symbols, lightly appearing and then vanishing, Grandpa and I were the only real things. Walking back from the village, I saw Mother standing alone in the glow of the setting sun, her hands mending the soles of shoes, her eyes holding that familiar and beloved gaze... The mist quickly surrounded us, Grandpa, Mother, and I all went back into the house.

	"Your father came to see you once while you were asleep." Mother connected a man who existed only in my dreams to me. "It seems like that really happened." I said this to comfort Mother's restless heart.

	All I saw was the sun, Grandpa, Mother, and me. Mother said, "When the sun sets, the moon will shine on your face. I was only bathed by the sun once during the day, and at night, I was bathed by the moon. If they were the eyes of that father, then I would be a child with a father.

	...An unprecedented loneliness seized me. A shudder of standing on the edge of an abyss came over me—in the inexpressible rhythm of the sound, all the thick fog surrounding a youth dissipated, I groped for my body in the darkness, I felt an unstoppable surge of heat coursing through it, facing the world was just me.

　　少年
    老愚
    就着煤油灯读完《林海雪原》，我１３岁的灵魂一片纯净。在我想象不能到达的北国，少剑波、白茹们的生命历程点燃了一个少年的青春之火……浪漫的战斗传奇和纯净如水的情爱波澜，在林海松涛之中以它无比的新鲜诱惑着我，有一种力量在我体内奔腾，有一种渴念从我心头升起，恍惚之间，我奔驰于雪原，我就是少剑波，白茹也就是我梦中永恒的情人……吹灭灯，坐在乡村的土炕上，我被厚重的黑夜围绕，一种难以言说的声音笼罩了我，它使我的灵魂溢出了躯体，试图冲破这恐惧的包围；这种声音越来越近地袭击我，周围的一切都不存在了，我仿佛处于世界的边缘，我的生命在这窒息人的气息里流逝……什么使我恐惧？什么正使我改变？黑夜把我和一种神秘的东西连在一起，我是谁，谁又是我？
    母亲说：“你是一九六三年阴历腊月初五来到人世的，属兔。”我知道自己活在人间却是自四岁始。
    爷爷的背，母亲的怀，院子里的菜花丛。骑在爷爷背上，我看见一个一个的人从我面前晃过，他们只是一些符号，轻盈地闪现复又消失，我和爷爷是我所能抓住的真的事物。从村里走回家，我看见母亲一个人伫立于夕阳的光辉里，双手纳着鞋底，眼里是我所熟悉并喜爱的那么一道清波……雾气很快出现在我们身边，爷爷，母亲和我一起回屋了。
    “你那个父亲在你睡着的时候看过你一眼。”母亲把一个在我梦里存在的男人跟我联系起来。“似乎真有这么回事。”我以此安慰母亲那颗不安的心。
    我所看到的只有太阳、爷爷、母亲和我。母亲说“太阳下山了，月亮就照你的脸了。我只是白天被太阳照过一回，夜里又给月亮照过一回。它们如果是那个父亲的两颗眼睛，我也就是有父亲的人儿了。
    ……一种空前的孤独攫住了我。有濒临深渊的颤栗袭来——在不可言传的声响的节律中，包裹一个少年的所有浓雾褪尽了，我在黑暗里摸索着自己的身体，我感到一股不可轻觑的热流在其间奔突，面对世界的就是我自己。
