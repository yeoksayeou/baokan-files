	Venezuela and Panama relations continue to worsen. Venezuela recalls its ambassador to Panama.

	According to the orders of President Perez, the Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs recalled its ambassador to Panama yesterday.

	Venezuelan newspapers believe this could be the first step towards a complete breakdown in relations between the two countries.

	As the crisis in Panama deepens, the relationship between Venezuela and Panama has become increasingly strained. Two days ago, high-ranking officials in the Panamanian military accused President Perez of attempting to recruit several high-ranking Panamanian generals through Panama's military attaché in Colombia to stage a coup to overthrow Noriega and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

	President Perez denied these accusations, stating that the Panamanian people won the election, but the results were nullified by the Panamanian government, which is itself a coup. Perez believes that Panama is currently under a dictatorship.

　　委巴两国关系日趋恶化  委内瑞拉召回驻巴大使
    本报加拉加斯５月１３日电  记者朱满庭报道：按照佩雷斯总统的命令，委内瑞拉外交部昨天召回了驻巴拿马大使。
    委内瑞拉报纸认为，这可能是委巴关系破裂的先期步骤。
    随着巴拿马危机的发展，委内瑞拉和巴拿马两国关系日益恶化，两天前，巴拿马军方的高级官员指责佩雷斯总统有意通过巴拿马驻哥伦比亚的武官物色几位巴拿马高级将领，发动推翻诺列加和总参谋部的政变。
    佩雷斯总统否认这一指责，并说巴拿马人民赢得了大选，但被巴拿马政府取消了，这才是政变。佩雷斯认为，巴拿马现在处于独裁统治之下。
