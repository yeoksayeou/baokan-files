After Removing the "Sick Man of Europe" Hat—Ten Years of Thatcher's Rule

By Chen Te-an, People's Daily Correspondent

May 4th marked the tenth anniversary of Margaret Thatcher's tenure at 10 Downing Street. In recent days, biographies, reports, and commentaries about Thatcher, "Thatcherism," and the "Thatcher Revolution" have flooded British newspapers and magazines. Radio and television have also aired special programs on "Thatcher's 10 Years." How has Thatcher's decade in power performed? Opinions in Britain are mixed, but there is a general consensus that these 10 years have "greatly changed the face of the British economy," removed the "Sick Man of Europe" label, and been a decade of "profound change."

Ten years ago, on May 4th, Thatcher, as Britain's first female Prime Minister, stood on the steps of 10 Downing Street and delivered her first speech, calling on all British people to "join hands and work together" for the "prosperity of the nation." At that time, Britain had the lowest economic growth rate among major industrialized countries, while its inflation rate was consistently the highest. Some European newspapers referred to it as a "developing country" and the "Sick Man of Europe" suffering from "British disease."

Over the past decade, Thatcher has remained steadfast in her original intentions. Political storms, economic downturns, wars, and even terrorist bombs have not shaken her resolve to change the face of the British economy. Her government has persisted with a tight monetary policy, formulated and implemented a "medium-term financial strategy," and now the results are evident. First, the British national economy has seen significant annual growth. From 1980 to 1988, Britain's average annual economic growth rate was 2.7%, surpassing major industrialized countries like the United States, West Germany, and France, as well as the 2.6% average growth rate of OECD member countries, second only to Japan's 4.1% growth rate. In 1988, Britain's economic growth rate reached 4.5%, surpassing Japan, leading the Western industrialized countries in this aspect. Second, the industrial structure has changed, productivity has increased, and competitiveness has strengthened. Statistics show that in recent years, Britain's high-tech products have seen an average annual growth rate of 18%, with enterprises introducing new products to the market at a rate of over 45%, leading Western industrialized countries. The development of high-tech industries has driven the reform of traditional industries, making Britain's labor productivity growth particularly prominent. From 1980 to 1988, Britain's per capita output value increased by 22.5%, an average annual increase of 2.5%, with manufacturing being particularly notable, with a per capita increase of 4.7%, and the annual growth rate in 1988 reaching as high as 7%. Third, fiscal revenues have improved year by year. With the development of the economy, government tax revenues have increased; the tight policy has reduced public expenditure; the privatization of state-owned enterprises has saved the government enterprise management fees and brought in a large sum of money. Thus, after the budget surplus of 3.5 billion pounds in the 1987-1988 fiscal year, the budget surplus for the 1988-1989 fiscal year reached 14 billion pounds. The budget for the 1989-1990 fiscal year is estimated to have a surplus of 14 billion pounds. Additionally, Britain's unemployment situation has improved, with the number of unemployed people decreasing from 3.4 million in the second half of 1986 to 1.946 million by February this year, with the current unemployment rate at 6.8%, the lowest since February 1981.

Some British newspapers believe that these "fundamental changes" have made the British people "move from despair to confidence."

However, after shedding the "Sick Man of Europe" label, the British economy still faces serious realities. The Conservative government, which has always prioritized controlling inflation, successfully reduced the inflation rate from its historical high of 21.9% in May 1980 to an unprecedented low of 2.4% in June-July 1986. But by March this year, inflation had risen to 7.8%, showing signs of resurgence. At the same time, Britain's current account deficit reached a record 14.5 billion pounds last year, and it is still difficult to reverse this year, with a significant deficit expected.

Facing these serious challenges, the Conservative government, in its 1989-1990 fiscal year budget report, continues to adhere to Thatcher's economic policies, reaffirming that reducing the inflation rate remains the government's top economic goal. It is determined to use high-interest rates to cool down the overheating economy, control consumption, reduce inflationary pressures, and decrease the trade deficit to achieve the goal of stable economic growth with low inflation. It is estimated that in the short term, Britain's inflation rate will exceed 8% this year but will drop back to around 6% by the end of the year.

The British government also emphasizes the need to slow down the pace of economic growth. To avoid the impact of a sudden brake on various industries, it proposes to adopt a "soft landing" approach, gradually slowing down economic growth. It is estimated that the annual economic growth rate this year will be between 2% and 3%, far lower than last year's growth rate, but it will remain above the average growth rate of major industrialized countries.

In summary, Thatcher's Conservative government has been in power for 10 years. After removing the "Sick Man of Europe" label, it still faces many problems, some of which are quite severe. However, 10 years of economic reform have greatly enhanced Britain's economic strength, restoring its position as the world's fifth-largest economy. People from all walks of life still have some confidence in the continued development of the British economy.

### 摘掉“欧洲病夫”帽子之后——撒切尔夫人执政十周年

　　摘掉“欧洲病夫”帽子之后   
     ——撒切尔夫人执政十周年
    本报记者  陈特安
    今年５月４日，是撒切尔夫人入主唐宁街１０号整整十周年的日子。近日来，关于撒切尔夫人其人、“撒切尔主义”及其带来的“撒切尔革命”等的传记、报道、评论充斥英国各大报刊，广播、电视也辟有“撒切尔１０年”的专题节目。撒切尔夫人执政十年政绩如何？此间舆论有褒有贬，但认为这１０年“大大改变了英国经济的面貌”，摘掉了“欧洲病夫”的帽子，是“深刻变革的１０年”，则是较为普遍的看法。
    １０年前的５月４日，撒切尔夫人作为英国历史上第一位女首相站在唐宁街１０号的台阶上发表第一次讲话，呼吁全体英国人民“携手并进，齐心协力”，为“国家的富强而奋斗”。那时，英国在主要工业国家中经济增长幅度最低，而通货膨胀率却一直领先。一些欧洲国家报刊称它沦为“次发达国家”，视之为患有“英国病”的“欧洲病夫”。
    迄今，已走过１０年的“奋斗”历程，撒切尔夫人依然未改初衷，政治风波、衰退压力、战争烽火，甚至恐怖炸弹，都未能动摇其改变英国经济面貌的决心。她领导的政府坚持以货币主义为主的紧缩经济政策，制订并推行“中期财政战略”，如今已见成效。首先，英国国民经济连年大幅度增长。１９８０至１９８８年期间，英国经济年平均增长率为２．７％，不仅超过美国、联邦德国、法国等主要工业国家，也超过经济合作与发展组织成员国２．６％的平均增长率，仅次于日本４．１％的增长率。１９８８年，英国经济增长率达４．５％，增幅已超过日本，在这一点上执西方工业国之牛耳，其次，工业结构发生了变化，生产率提高，竞争力增强。据统计，近几年里英国高科技产品年平均增长率达１８％，企业新产品投放市场比例达４５％以上，居西方工业国家之首。高科技工业的发展推动了传统工业的改革，使英国劳动生产率增长十分突出，从１９８０至１９８８年，英国人均产值增长２２．５％，平均每年增长２．５％，制造业尤为突出，人均增长４．７％，１９８８年的年平均增幅更高达７％。再次，财政收支逐年好转，随着经济的发展，政府税入大增；紧缩政策减少了公共开支；国营企业私有化既为政府节省企业管理费又为政府带来一大笔收入。这样，继１９８７至１９８８年度预算首次出现３５亿英镑的盈余之后，１９８８至１９８９年度预算财政盈余高达１４０亿英镑。１９８９至１９９０年度预算估计仍有１４０亿英镑的盈余。此外，英国的失业状况不断改善，从１９８６年下半年起到今年２月份，失业人数已从３４０万下降至１９４．６万，目前的失业率为６．８％，为１９８１年２月份以来的最低水平。
    此间一些报刊认为，这些带“根本性的变化”已经使英国人“从灰心失望走向自信有望”。
    然而，在甩掉“欧洲病夫”的帽子之后，英国经济目前依然面临严峻的现实。一直把控制通货膨胀作为首要经济目标的保守党政府，曾成功地将通货膨胀率从１９８０年５月份的２１．９％的历史高峰降至１９８６年６至７月份的２．４％的空前低水平。但今年３月份，通货膨胀已回升到７．８％，大有卷土重来之势。同时，去年英国国际收支经常项目出现创纪录的１４５亿英镑逆差，今年尚难扭转，估计仍会出现巨额逆差。
    面对这严重的挑战，保守党政府在其１９８９—１９９０财政年度预算报告中，仍坚持撒切尔夫人既定的经济政策，重申降低通货膨胀率仍是政府首要的经济目标，并决心以高利率为手段来冷却过热的经济增长，控制消费，减轻通货膨胀的压力，减少外贸逆差，以实现低通货膨胀率下的稳定经济增长目标。据估计，今年短期内英国通货膨胀率会超过８％，但到年底会回降到６％上下。
    英国政府还强调要放慢经济增长速度。但为避免急刹车对各行业的冲击，提出要采取“软着陆”方式，逐步放慢经济增长。估计今年全年经济增长率在２％—３％之间，远低于去年的增长幅度，但将保持在主要工业国家的平均增长水平之上。
    纵观全貌，撒切尔夫人的保守党政府执政１０年，摘去了英国头上“欧洲病夫”的帽子之后，仍面临不少问题，有些甚至还非常严峻。但１０年的经济变革已大大增强英国的经济实力，恢复其世界第５经济大国的地位，各界人士对英国经济的继续发展仍有一定的信心。
