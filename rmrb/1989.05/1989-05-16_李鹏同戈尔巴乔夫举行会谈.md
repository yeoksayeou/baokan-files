Li Peng Meets with Gorbachev

	BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng of the State Council held a formal meeting with Chairman Gorbachev this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Li Peng said, "This morning, you had a beneficial conversation with Chairman Deng Xiaoping, ending the past and opening the future. Sino-Soviet relations have begun to normalize, and I am very pleased about this." Gorbachev said, "Sino-Soviet relations have reached a new level and entered a new stage. The normalization of relations between the two countries should look to the future."

	When discussing international issues, Li Peng said, "China is pleased with the easing of the international situation. Of course, problems still exist, and many hotspot issues remain unresolved. The danger of nuclear war still threatens humanity, and there is also the issue of an irrational international economic order."

	He said, "Peace and development are the universal aspirations of all countries today. This is especially true for developing countries like China. China urgently needs a peaceful external environment and a stable internal environment to achieve the Four Modernizations."

	Li Peng said, "We do not believe that freedom, democracy, and human rights are the exclusive property of capitalist countries. Socialist countries should also be free, democratic, and enjoy full human rights. China is prepared to further improve these aspects in its political reforms. We have noted Gorbachev's 'new thinking,' which has provided new evaluations of many major issues. For China, we advocate the establishment of a new international political order, meaning that relations between countries should be based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, advocated by China, have been proven effective through decades of practice." Li Peng welcomed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union and hoped that the two countries could reach an agreement on significantly reducing nuclear weapons, especially strategic nuclear weapons.

	Gorbachev said, "Both the world and Sino-Soviet relations are at a turning point. Both countries need normal external conditions. The Soviet Union also believes that deepening reforms is necessary to give socialism new content. The Soviet Union has proposed a new political thinking. Sino-Soviet relations should be based on universally accepted principles of peaceful coexistence, which means not returning to the relations of the 1950s or the confrontational relations of the 1960s and 1970s. Of course, there are different views on various issues, and we should respect differences in opinions, seriously consider each other's positions, and seek a certain balance of interests."

	When discussing bilateral relations, Li Peng said, "China is willing to actively develop Sino-Soviet bilateral relations. China and the Soviet Union share more than 7,000 kilometers of common border. China and the Soviet Union should develop good-neighborly relations. There are many favorable conditions for developing economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and there is complementarity in this regard."

	Gorbachev said, "The Soviet side believes that there is great potential for developing Sino-Soviet bilateral cooperation."

	Both sides exchanged views on how to further develop economic and trade relations and other issues of common interest.

	Gorbachev, on behalf of the Soviet leadership, invited Li Peng to make an official visit to the Soviet Union, and Li Peng happily accepted the invitation.

	Those present from the Chinese side included Vice Premiers Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin.

	Those present from the Soviet side included Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Politburo member Alexander Yakovlev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Vitaly Maslyukov, and Minister of Health Yevgeny Chazov.

	According to eyewitnesses, around 2 PM, the Soviet dignitaries traveled by special car from the Great Hall of the People to the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. When they reached the south entrance of Baiyun Road, Gorbachev requested to stop the car. He got out of the car and said to the surrounding crowd, "Hello, greetings to everyone. Just now, I met with your country's top leader and shook hands with him tightly. Sino-Soviet relations have been completely normalized. On behalf of the Soviet people, I express my thanks to you." About 300 people applauded enthusiastically. A female worker handed a card to Gorbachev's wife Raisa to sign as a keepsake. Raisa happily signed it. The entire stop lasted about 5 minutes, and the order among the onlookers was good.

　　李鹏同戈尔巴乔夫举行会谈
    本报北京５月１６日讯  记者温宪、周象光报道：国务院总理李鹏今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆同戈尔巴乔夫主席举行了正式会谈。李鹏说，今天上午，你同邓小平主席进行了有益的谈话，结束了过去，开辟了未来。中苏关系已经开始正常化，对此我感到非常高兴。戈尔巴乔夫说，苏中关系已经提高到一个新水平，进入了新阶段。两国关系正常化要面向未来。
    在谈到国际问题时，李鹏说，中国对国际形势出现缓和感到高兴。当然，问题仍然存在，许多热点问题尚未解决。核战争的危险仍然威胁着人类，还有一个不合理的国际经济关系问题。
    他说，和平与发展是当代各国的普遍要求。这对发展中的中国尤其如此。中国非常需要一个和平的外部环境，同时也非常需要一个安定的内部环境。这样才能实现四化任务。
    李鹏说，我们不认为自由、民主、人权是资本主义国家的专利。社会主义国家也应是自由的、民主的，享有充分的人权。中国准备在政治改革中进一步完善这些方面。我们注意到戈尔巴乔夫的“新思维”，注意到“新思维”对许多重大问题做了新的评价。对中国来说，中国提倡建立国际政治新秩序，也就是说，国与国的关系应该建立在和平共处五项原则基础上。和平共处五项原则是中国倡导的，经过几十年实践证明是有效的。李鹏对美苏达成中导协议表示欢迎，并希望美苏能就大幅度削减核武器，特别是就大幅度削减战略核武器达成协议。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，无论是世界还是苏中两国，都正处于转折时期。苏中都需要一个正常的外部条件。苏联还认为，必须深入改革以使社会主义具有新的内容。苏联提出了新政治思维。苏中关系应该建立在通用的和平共处的原则基础上，这意味着不是回到五十年代的关系，也脱离六十、七十年代的对峙关系。当然，苏中对不同问题有不同看法，应该尊重意见的不一致，认真对待对方立场，寻求一定的利益均衡。
    在谈到双边关系时，李鹏说，中国愿意积极发展中苏双边关系。中苏有７０００多公里的共同边界。中苏应该发展睦邻关系。中苏发展经济合作存在着许多有利条件，在这方面有互补性。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，苏方认为发展苏中双边合作潜力很大。
    双方就如何进一步发展经贸关系以及其他共同感兴趣的问题交换了意见。
    戈尔巴乔夫代表苏联领导邀请李鹏正式访问苏联，李鹏愉快地接受了邀请。
    中国方面参加会谈的有国务院副总理田纪云、吴学谦、外长钱其琛、经贸部长郑拓彬等。
    苏联方面参加会谈的有谢瓦尔德纳泽外长、雅科夫列夫政治局委员、马斯柳科夫部长会议第一副主席和恰佐夫卫生部长等。
    另据目击者告诉记者，下午２时左右，苏联贵宾乘专车从人民大会堂到钓鱼台国宾馆途中行至白云路南口时，戈尔巴乔夫要求停车。他从车上走下来，向周围的群众说：“你们好，向大家问好。刚才我见到了你们国家最高领导人，并同他紧紧地握了手。苏中两国关系已经完全正常化了。我代表苏联人民向你们表示感谢。”约３００名群众热烈鼓掌。一位女工递给戈尔巴乔夫的夫人赖莎一个证卡要求签名留念。赖莎高兴地为她签了名。整个停留时间约５分钟，在场群众秩序良好。
