Since the beginning of spring, more than 20 small fishing boats from our town have been operating in the Da Chen fishing grounds, specifically in the areas east of San Suan and east of Pi Shan. They frequently encounter a gang of "pirates" who rob them. These "pirates" speak with a Fuzhou accent and operate a large ship with over 100 horsepower. Seeing that our boats have few crew members and are small with low horsepower, they act arrogantly and forcibly take the fish from our ship's hold, setting the price for the fish entirely at their discretion. If we argue with them, not only do we not get a single cent, but we also get beaten. On March 16th, a villager from our town, Zhuang Daoxi, was operating east of Pi Shan when he was attacked by "pirates" three times in one day. From March 13th to 17th, Chen Xiangcai from Xinjian Village was attacked by "pirates" six times, and all his fish were stolen. The fishermen hope that the relevant departments will take measures to effectively safeguard the safety of fishermen's lives and property.

　　大陈渔场遇“海盗”
    入春以来，我镇２０多只小捕鱼船在大陈渔场三蒜东和披山东一带作业，经常遭到一伙“海盗”抢劫。这伙“海盗”操福州口音，驾驶着１００多马力的大船。他们见我们船上的人少，船小、马力小，便横行霸道，强行搬走我们船舱里的鱼，鱼的价格完全由他们说了算。如果我们据理力争，不但一分钱也拿不到，反而还要挨打。３月１６日，我镇里箬村的庄道喜在披山东的海面上作业时，一天遭３次“海盗”袭击。３月１３日至１７日，新建村的陈祥才６次遭到“海盗”袭击，鱼货全被抢去。渔民们希望有关部门采取措施，切实保障渔民生命财产安全。
