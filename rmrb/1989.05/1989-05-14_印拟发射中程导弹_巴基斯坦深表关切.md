Pakistan has expressed deep concern over India's plan to launch a medium-range ballistic missile.

The spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Ministry said on May 11 that India's large-scale military buildup, nuclear program, and development of long-range missiles cannot help but increase the worries and sense of insecurity of other countries in the region. The spokesman regretted that the Indian government, while starting the development and production of new destructive weapon systems, has not actively responded to specific proposals for reducing defense spending and maintaining South Asia as a nuclear-free zone.

He said that India's launch of a ballistic missile would pose a threat to the security of the region and to world peace and stability, and would inevitably provoke a strong reaction in the region.

    据新华社伊斯兰堡５月１２日电  巴基斯坦对印度准备发射中程弹道导弹深表关切。
    巴基斯坦外交部发言人１１日说，印度大规模的军备建设、核计划及远程导弹的发展不能不使本地区其他国家增加忧虑和不安全感。发言人对印度政府开始发展和生产新式的毁灭性武器系统而未能积极响应削减国防开支、保持南亚为无核区的具体建议而感到遗憾。
    他说，印度发射弹道导弹将对本地区的安全和世界和平与稳定构成威胁，势必要在本地区引起强烈的反响。
