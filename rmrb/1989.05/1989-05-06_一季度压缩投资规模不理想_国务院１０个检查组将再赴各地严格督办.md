The compression of fixed asset investment scale in the first quarter was not very satisfactory. At the third meeting of the 10 inspection teams held this afternoon, the head of the State Council's project rectification leading group reported on the compression situation in the first quarter and required all localities to seriously investigate the causes and take effective measures to strictly control the investment scale within the assessment indicators. It was also announced that the 10 inspection teams will return to various places around May 15 to supervise and inspect, assist local authorities in implementing assessment indicators, and ensure that the planning "cage" is in place.

According to statistics on the completion of the investment scale of state-owned enterprises in 29 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) nationwide, excluding Tibet, the total investment completed in basic construction and technological transformation from January to March this year was reduced by 62.4 million yuan compared to the same period last year, accounting for only 3.3% of the actual investment amount in the same period last year, which is 20 percentage points less than the required compression task of 23.93%. Among these, the investment completed in basic construction compared to the same period last year was not only not compressed but actually increased by 7.8 million yuan.

From the situation in various provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), 17 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) completed investment scales lower than the same period last year in the first quarter, with Gansu and Ningxia performing the best, achieving the percentage compression task for this year. Those that not only did not compress but actually expanded to varying degrees include Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia, with Guangdong being the most severe and Shanghai following closely.

　　一季度压缩投资规模不理想    
    国务院１０个检查组将再赴各地严格督办
    本报北京５月６日讯  记者鲁牧报道：第一季度压缩固定资产投资规模的情况不很理想。国务院清理项目领导小组负责人在今天下午举行的１０个检查组第三次会议上，通报首季压缩情况后，要求各地认真查明原因，采取得力措施，把投资规模严格控制在考核指标之内。并宣布１０个检查组将于１５日前后再赴各地督促、检查，协助地方落实考核指标，装好计划“笼子”。
    据对西藏之外全国２９个省（区、市）全民所有制投资规模完成情况统计，今年１至３月份基本建设和技术改造完成的投资总额比去年同期压缩６．２４亿元，仅相当于去年同期实际投资额的３．３％，比应压缩任务２３．９３％少２０个百分点。其中，基本建设完成投资额与去年同期相比，不仅没有压缩，相反还增加了０．７８亿元。
    从各省（区、市）的情况看，一季度完成投资规模低于去年同期水平的有１７个省（区、市），其中甘肃、宁夏最好，压缩投资规模达到了今年压缩的百分比任务。不仅没有压缩，反而有不同程度膨胀的，有京、津、沪、粤、闽、赣、冀、豫、皖、陕、青、内蒙古１２个省（区、市）。其中，广东最为严重，上海其次。
