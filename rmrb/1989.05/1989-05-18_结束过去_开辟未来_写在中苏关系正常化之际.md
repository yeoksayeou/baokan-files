At the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun of the People's Republic of China, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail Gorbachev visited China from May 15 to 18. Chairman Gorbachev held a meeting with Chairman Deng Xiaoping and had separate meetings and talks with Chairman Yang Shangkun, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, and Premier Li Peng, exchanging views on issues related to bilateral relations and current international affairs. This high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union marks the normalization of relations between the two countries. The relationship between the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has also been normalized. After 30 years of prolonged estrangement, this historic meeting has brought Sino-Soviet relations to a new starting point, ending the past and opening the future.

Currently, the international situation has undergone tremendous changes, with a shift from confrontation to dialogue and from tension to relaxation becoming a global trend. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is in line with this historical trend. China and the Soviet Union are not only neighboring countries but also two influential powers in the world, with a combined population of nearly a quarter of the world's total. The two countries share a border of over 7,000 kilometers. The new type of relationship between China and the Soviet Union does not target any third country, will not harm the interests of other countries, and will not affect their respective relations with other countries. Therefore, the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is in line with the wishes of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and the world, and is conducive to the stability and development of the Asia-Pacific region, as well as to world peace and security.

The Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué summarized the results of this high-level meeting. The communiqué emphasized that the two countries will establish a new type of relationship based on the general principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The practice of international relations in the decades since World War II has proven that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are effective guidelines for relations between countries, applicable to both countries with different social systems and countries with similar social systems. It has withstood the test of history and has proven to be the most vital. As long as both China and the Soviet Union adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in their bilateral relations, Sino-Soviet relations can develop in a stable and healthy manner. As for the relationship between the two parties, it can only develop normally and stably if it is based on the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs.

The communiqué declared that neither China nor the Soviet Union seeks any form of hegemony in Asia, the Pacific, or any other region of the world, and opposes any country seeking any form of hegemony anywhere. In today's world, hegemony is unpopular, whether it is global hegemony or regional hegemony, it is increasingly unworkable and is heading towards bankruptcy or has already collapsed. If all countries in the world handle their relations with each other according to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, without pursuing hegemony or power politics, then world peace will be guaranteed, and a new international political order can gradually be established. China is committed to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, oppose hegemony, and work for world peace, making its due contribution to the peace, development, and progress of humanity.

During the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union, as leaders of two socialist countries, both sides exchanged views on the challenges facing socialism. Currently, socialism is facing serious challenges, and the only way to meet this challenge is through reform. The facts have shown that socialism cannot exist in a fixed model, and Marxist-Leninists in each country can only build socialism based on their own national conditions. This will be beneficial for the inheritance, enrichment, and development of Marxism-Leninism in practice, giving new impetus to the cause of socialism.

The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is hard-won. Today, through the joint efforts of both sides, substantial progress has been made in removing obstacles to the normalization of relations between the two countries. The normalization of relations between the two countries will also promote new developments in political, economic, technological, and cultural relations between the two sides. However, obstacles have not been completely removed, especially the Cambodian issue has not been truly resolved and requires further efforts in the future. The Soviet Union can still play a role in this regard. We hope that the Soviet Union will make concrete efforts to promote a fair and reasonable resolution of the Cambodian issue, to remove the remaining shadow over our bilateral relations, and to ease the tension in Southeast Asia.

Chairman Gorbachev's visit was warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and marked a new chapter in Sino-Soviet relations. Both sides agreed to continue exchanging views and holding dialogues in the future, which is of great significance for the future development of Sino-Soviet relations. Currently, both China and the Soviet Union are carrying out socialist reforms. The Chinese people are very concerned about the reforms being carried out by the Soviet people. At the moment of bidding farewell to Chairman Gorbachev, we sincerely wish the Soviet people's reforms success!

### 结束过去　开辟未来——写在中苏关系正常化之际

　　结束过去　开辟未来   
    ——写在中苏关系正常化之际
    应中华人民共和国主席杨尚昆的邀请，苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫于本月１５日至１８日对我国进行了正式访问。戈尔巴乔夫主席同邓小平主席举行了会晤，并分别同杨尚昆主席、赵紫阳总书记、李鹏总理进行了会见和会谈，就两国关系问题和当前的国际问题交换意见。这次中苏高级会晤，标志着中苏两国关系实现了正常化。中国共产党和苏联共产党的关系也随之正常化。中苏两国关系在经历了３０年的长期隔阂后，通过这一次历史性会晤，结束过去，开辟未来，走到了一个新的起点。
    当前，国际局势发生了巨大的变化，从对抗转向对话，由紧张转向缓和的趋势正在成为一股世界性潮流。中苏两国关系正常化顺应了这一历史潮流。中国和苏联不仅是邻国，也是世界上有影响的两个大国，人口将近占了全人类的１／４，两国间有７０００多公里长的边界线。中苏之间的新型关系不针对任何第三国，不会损害别的国家的利益，也不影响各自同其他国家的关系。因此，中苏两国关系的正常化符合中苏两国人民和世界人民的愿望，中苏关系正常化，有利于亚太地区的稳定与发展，有利于世界的和平与安全。
    中苏联合公报概括了这次高级会晤的成果。公报强调中苏两国将在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的国与国之间关系的普遍原则基础上建立一种新型关系。战后几十年国际关系的实践证明，和平共处五项原则是国与国之间行之有效的准则，既适用于不同社会制度的国家，也适用于社会制度相同国家之间的相互关系。它经历了长期的历史的考验，已证明是最富有生命力的。今后，只要中苏双方在两国关系中切实按和平共处五项原则办事，中苏关系就可以得到稳定、健康的发展。至于中苏两党的关系，也只有建立在独立自主、完全平等、相互尊重、互不干涉内部事务四项原则的基础上，才能获得正常和平稳的发展。
    公报宣称，中苏两国任何一方都不在亚洲和太平洋地区以及世界其他地区谋求任何形式的霸权，也反对任何国家在任何地方谋求任何形式的霸权。当今世界，搞霸权主义不得人心，无论是搞全球霸权主义还是搞地区霸权主义都越来越行不通了，已陷于破产或者正在走向破产。如果世界上所有国家，都按和平共处五项原则处理国与国间的关系，不搞霸权主义、强权政治，那么世界的和平就会得到保障，一个新的国际政治新秩序就可以逐步建立起来。中国忠实于和平共处五项原则，今后也将坚定奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，反对霸权主义，维护世界和平，为人类的和平、发展、进步作出应有的贡献。
    中苏高级会晤期间，作为两个社会主义国家的领导人，双方交换了对于社会主义所面临问题的看法。当前，社会主义遇到了严重的挑战，迎接这一场挑战，只有依靠改革，别无出路。事实表明社会主义不可能存在一种固定的模式，各国马列主义者只能从各国的实际情况出发，根据自己的条件建设社会主义。这将有利于在实践中用各种新思想来继承、丰富和发展马列主义，给社会主义事业以新的推动。
    中苏关系的正常化是来之不易的。今天，经过双方的共同努力，在消除两国关系正常化障碍方面取得了实质性的进展。两国关系的正常化，也必将推动双方政治、经贸、科技、文化等领域关系的新发展。但是，障碍还没有完全消除，特别是柬埔寨问题还没有真正解决，还有待于今后进一步努力。苏联在这一方面仍将是可以有所作为的。我们希望苏联作出切实的努力，促进柬埔寨问题的公正、合理解决，以消除仍然笼罩在我们两国关系上的阴影，缓和东南亚的紧张形势。
    戈尔巴乔夫主席的这次访问，受到中国人民的热烈欢迎，在中苏关系史上揭开了新的一页。双方通过会晤，确定今后两国领导人还要继续交换意见，进行对话。这对今后中苏关系的发展具有重要意义。目前，中苏都在进行社会主义改革。中国人民十分关心苏联人民进行的改革。在送别戈尔巴乔夫主席的时刻，我们衷心祝愿苏联人民进行的改革取得成功！
