A new technology, code-named "813" protective agent, has recently been applied to the research, production, and maintenance of missiles, aircraft, and warships. This marks the first time China has applied civilian technological achievements on a large scale to the military field.

Currently, more than 300 military industrial and military units nationwide are promoting and applying this technology. The Air Force has applied this protective agent to thousands of aircraft, reducing electronic equipment failures by half and engine instrument failures by 80%. This protective agent significantly improves the flight speed and accuracy of missiles and helps solve certain technical difficulties in the development of radar and communication equipment.
