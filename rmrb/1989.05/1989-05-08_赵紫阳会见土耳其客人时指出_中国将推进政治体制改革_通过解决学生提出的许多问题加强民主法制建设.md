Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 8th.

	Zhao Ziyang, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, said today that many of the demands raised by young students recently are issues that the Party and the government must strive to solve. "We will solve these problems on the track of democracy and the rule of law, and at the same time, advance the construction of democracy and the rule of law in our country by solving these problems."

	He emphasized that China will not only firmly carry out economic system reform but will also further advance political system reform, so that economic system reform and political system reform can promote each other.

	Zhao Ziyang made these remarks this afternoon in Zhongnanhai when he met with a delegation led by Chairman Eldar Inonu of the Social Democratic People's Party of Turkey.

	In introducing the current domestic situation to the guests, he said that recently, some students in Beijing and other cities have taken to the streets to march and go on strike. Due to the Party and the government's consistently restrained and tolerant attitude, and because the majority of students have shown increasing rationality and paid attention to order and discipline, the situation has been prevented from escalating. Now most students have returned to class.

	Inonu praised China's Party and government for adopting a tolerant and restrained attitude towards the student marches.

	Zhao Ziyang said: In a country as large as China, it is impossible to solve reform and development problems without encountering any issues; there will always be this or that problem, some troubles; but overall, China will not encounter major problems. He stressed that China's current policy of reform and opening up will not change and will continue.

	During the meeting, Zhao Ziyang expressed satisfaction with the expanding friendly cooperation between China and Turkey in various fields such as politics, economy, and culture in recent years.

	He introduced to the guests that the Communist Party of China, in accordance with the principles of "independence, autonomy, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs," has established relations with more than 260 friendly political parties and organizations around the world.

	Zhao Ziyang said that developing friendly exchanges between parties is an important channel for developing state relations and friendly relations between peoples.

	He expressed appreciation for the active contributions made by the Social Democratic People's Party of Turkey in maintaining national independence and sovereignty, developing the national economy, supporting the just struggles of peoples of various countries, and maintaining world peace.

	The delegation, led by Inonu, arrived in Beijing yesterday at the invitation of the Communist Party of China and began a friendly visit to China. This is the first time a delegation from the Social Democratic People's Party of Turkey has visited China.

	This morning, Zhu Liang, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Minister of the International Liaison Department, held talks with the delegation. Zhu Liang also participated in the afternoon meeting.

　　赵紫阳会见土耳其客人时指出    
    中国将推进政治体制改革 
    通过解决学生提出的许多问题加强民主法制建设
    新华社北京５月８日电  （记者周树春）中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天说，最近青年学生提出的要求中，许多是党和政府要努力解决的问题，“我们将在民主和法制的轨道上解决这些问题，同时通过解决这些问题把我国的民主和法制建设推进一步”。
    他强调说，中国不仅将坚定不移地推行经济体制改革，而且将进一步推进政治体制的改革，使经济体制改革和政治体制改革相互促进。
    赵紫阳是今天下午在中南海会见由主席埃尔达尔·伊诺努率领的土耳其社会民主人民党代表团时说这些话的。
    他在向客人们介绍当前国内形势时说，最近在北京等城市发生一些学生上街游行和罢课的情况，由于党和政府一直采取非常克制和容忍的态度，也由于大多数学生日益表现出理智，注意秩序和纪律，因而避免了事态的激化。现在大部分学生已经复课。
    伊诺努赞赏中国党和政府对学生游行采取容忍和克制的态度。
    赵紫阳说：在中国这样一个大国解决改革和发展问题，要想一点问题都不出是不可能的，总会出现这样或那样的问题，出现一点麻烦；但总的来看，中国不会出现大的问题。他强调说，中国现行的改革开放政策不会改变，将继续下去。
    会见时，赵紫阳对中国和土耳其近年来在政治、经济和文化等各个领域不断扩大的友好合作表示满意。
    他向客人们介绍说，中国共产党按照“独立自主、完全平等、互相尊重、互不干涉内部事务”的原则，已同世界上２６０多个友好政党和组织建立了关系。
    赵紫阳说，发展党与党之间的友好往来是发展国家关系和人民之间友好关系的一个重要渠道。
    他对土耳其社会民主人民党在维护国家独立和主权，发展民族经济，支持各国人民的正义斗争和维护世界和平方面做出的积极贡献表示赞赏。
    伊诺努一行应中共中央邀请于昨天抵京，开始对中国进行友好访问。这是土耳其社会民主人民党首次派团访华。
    今天上午，中共中央委员、中联部部长朱良同代表团举行会谈。朱良参加了下午的会见。
