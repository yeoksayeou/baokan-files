In the current situation of limited funds, energy shortages, and transportation bottlenecks, are there still ways to achieve high returns with minimal investment? Yes, that is "promoting new technologies for high returns." Many experts from various industries reached this consensus at the National New Technology Promotion Work Symposium.

Experts cited numerous examples. Taking Beijing as an example, due to the promotion of microelectronics technology in mechanical and electrical products, a large number of products have improved their intelligence level, thereby significantly enhancing their market competitiveness. For example, the First Machine Tool Factory's numerically controlled milling machine, the Electric Meter Factory's intelligent meters, the Optical Instrument Factory's microcomputer-based rangefinders, the Analytical Instrument Factory's infrared spectrophotometers, the Washing Machine Factory's fully automatic washing machines, and the Measuring Tool Factory's digital calipers—all these products have seen a significant increase in domestic and international sales prices with only a slight increase in cost. The Beijing Measuring Tool Factory uses ion plating technology to produce titanium nitride-coated drills, which are exported in large quantities, earning $2 million annually. The Beijing Telecommunications Tool Factory adopted casting and heat treatment technology to develop the "American-style pliers," increasing the export exchange rate from $0.6 to $1.4 per plier. With an annual export of 300,000 pliers, the additional foreign exchange earned is over $3 million.

Some new technologies can be applied not only in industry but also in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries. Taking the application of rare earth elements as an example, according to the Office of the State Council's Rare Earth Leading Group, China has applied rare earth technology in metallurgy, machinery, petroleum, chemical industry, and new materials, and has independently developed rare earth agricultural technology. Since the 1980s, China has consistently conducted research and exploration in this area. After seven years of breakthroughs and demonstrations, large-scale promotion began in 1986. More than a hundred tests and inspections have been conducted on the effects of applying rare earth elements to farmland, with a success rate of over 90% and an increase in yield of 8% to 10%. Currently, 23 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions have promoted rare earth micro-fertilizers in 21 crops. From 1986 to 1988, a total of 40 million mu (approximately 2.67 million hectares) were promoted, increasing grain and oil production by 400 million kilograms and creating an economic benefit of 320 million yuan. Henan Province began promoting rare earth agricultural technology in 1983, conducting demonstration experiments in more than 20 projects including winter wheat, tobacco, cotton, soybeans, peanuts, watermelons, green beans, tomatoes, bell peppers, tea leaves, silkworm rearing, chickens, and fish. The promotion area reached over 4 million mu, achieving an economic benefit of over 80 million yuan.

Some new technologies are relatively complex, while others are simple and can be easily learned by anyone. For example, the technology of covering the ground with plastic film, known as the "poverty alleviation project" by some regions, has been rapidly promoted in China in recent years. In 1980, the national demonstration area was only 25,000 mu. By 1982, it had expanded to 1.77 million mu, and by 1984, it reached 20 million mu. From 1985 to 1988, the cumulative promotion area reached 118 million mu, with a social and economic benefit of over 6 billion yuan. Currently, the technology of using plastic film is being extended to the breeding industry.

According to experts, although China has achieved many results in promoting new technologies in recent years, there are still many problems in terms of recognition, measures, and policies. Currently, China's new technology promotion work is mainly organized and implemented by the National Development and Reform Commission and the new technology promotion stations, exchange stations, and economic and technological market development centers of various provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and planning-single cities. These units should work with governments at all levels and relevant departments to further study and solve existing problems, pushing China's new technology promotion work to a new breadth and depth.

　　推广一本万利的实用新技术
    本报记者  王溪元
    在当前资金短缺、能源不足、运输紧张的窘况下，还有没有少投入、多产出的门路？有，那就是“新技术推广，一本万利。”许多行业的技术专家在全国新技术推广工作座谈会上得出了这个共同的结论。
    专家们列举了大量事实。以北京为例，由于推广微电子技术在机电产品上的应用，使一大批产品提高了智能化水平，从而大大增强了市场竞争能力。如第一机床厂的数控铣床、电表厂的智能化仪表、光学仪器厂的微机化测距经纬仪、分析仪器厂的红外分光光度计、洗衣机厂的全自动洗衣机、量具刃具厂的数显卡尺等，都是成本增加不多，而在国内外的售价却成倍增长。北京量具刃具厂应用离子镀技术生产氮化钛镀黄钻头大量出口，每年创汇２０万美元。北京电讯工具厂采用铸造热处理技术开发出“美式钳”，使每把电讯钳出口换汇率由０．６美元提高到１．４美元，全年出口３０万把，多换汇３０多万美元。
    有些新技术不仅能用在工业上，而且能用于农、林、牧、副、渔等各个方面。以稀土元素的应用为例，据国务院稀土领导小组办公室统计，我国不仅在冶金、机械、石油、化工、新材料等方面应用了稀土技术，而且在农业上独立开创了稀土农用技术。自８０年代以来，我国一直坚持这方面的研究、探索，经过７年的攻关、示范，从１９８６年开始进行大面积推广。对农田施用效果进行了上百次测算验收，其结果为增产几率达９０％以上，增产幅度为８％—１０％。现在全国已有２３个省、市、自治区在２１种作物上开展了稀土微肥的推广工作。１９８６至１９８８年三年累计推广４０００万亩，增产粮油４亿公斤，创经济效益３．２亿元。河南省从１９８３年开始推广稀土农用技术，相继在冬小麦、烟草、棉花、大豆、花生、西瓜、菜豆角、蕃茄、甜椒、茶叶以及养蚕、鸡、鱼等２０多个项目上进行示范试验，推广面积达到４００多万亩，取得经济效益达８０００多万元。
    有些新技术是比较复杂的，而有些新技术则一学就会，人人可“推”。比如地膜覆盖技术，被某些地区的农民称为“温饱工程”，近些年来在我国被迅速地推广应用。１９８０年时，全国仅有示范面积２．５万亩，１９８２年发展到１７７万亩，１９８４年则达到２０００万亩。１９８５—１９８８年累计推广面积达１．１８亿亩，社会经济效益达６０多亿元。目前，地膜应用技术已向养殖业发展。
    据专家们反映，近些年来我国在新技术推广方面虽然取得了许多成果，但在认识、措施、政策等方面都还存在不少问题。当前我国的新技术推广工作主要由国家计委和各省、市、自治区、计划单列城市经委（计经委）系统新技术推广站、交流站、经济技术市场发展中心等单位进行组织实施，这些单位应当协同各级政府和各有关部门，进一步研究解决现存问题，把我国的新技术推广工作推向一个新的广度和深度。
