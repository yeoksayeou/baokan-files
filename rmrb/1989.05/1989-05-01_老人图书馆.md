The phrase "In Africa, the death of an elder is like burning a library" is indeed accurate. Elders are often seen as symbols of wisdom, embodiments of experience, and guardians of tradition.

In Africa, elders are generally respected and loved by everyone, often referred to as "sages," and hold high status. During festivals, celebrations, or religious ceremonies, the elderly, dressed in long robes, always sit in the front row, and some ceremonies are even presided over by them. Each village has a "think tank" composed of several elders who participate in the management of the entire village.

Elders are also the transmitters of traditional African culture, known as "libraries." Although Africa created its own civilization long ago, before the arrival of colonialists, there was only spoken language, no written script. Many customs, proverbs, and folktales were passed down orally from generation to generation. This task naturally falls to the elders. In Abidjan, there lives an elder named Ampaté Ba. Recently, people collected over 20 folktales he narrated and published a book titled "A Pinch of Dust." The elder embeds the philosophy of life and codes of conduct in stories about flowers, birds, beasts, and insects, like mirrors, allowing people to observe themselves and discern good from evil. For example, "The Shoe and the Shoemaker" explains how two brothers can become enemies; "The Hyena and the Sleeping Lion" mocks the hyena's misfortune due to his arrogance.

There are many elders like Ampaté Ba in Africa. Through vivid and interesting stories, they narrate life, enlighten the younger generation, and resolve disputes. African elders are indeed a rich cultural treasure trove.

　　老人图书馆
    “在非洲，一个老人去世就等于焚烧了一个图书馆”，此话确实不错。老人常被看作智慧的象征，经验的化身，传统的卫士。
    老人在非洲，普遍受到人们的尊敬和爱戴，被称为“贤人”，地位颇高。每逢节日盛典、红白喜事或祭祀神灵时，身著长袍的长者总是坐在最前排，有些礼仪还由他们主持。每个村镇都有一个由几位老人组成的“智囊团”，参加管理全村的事务。
    老人还是非洲传统文化的传播者，被誉为“图书馆”。非洲虽然很早就创造了自己的文明，但在殖民主义者到来之前，只有语言，没有文字，许多民俗、民谚和民间故事都是靠口头一代代相传。这个工作理所当然地由老人承担。在阿比让的马科利就住着这样一位老人，他的名字叫昂帕泰·巴。不久前人们搜集了他口述的２０余个童话故事，编辑出版了一本取名《一撮尘土》的书。老人寓人生哲学和行动规范于花鸟兽虫的故事之中，像一面面镜子，供人观察自我，分辨美丑善恶。例如，《鞋和鞋匠》阐述了两个同胞兄弟也能成为仇敌的道理；《鬣狗与睡狮》则讥讽鬣狗因自命不凡而招来厄运。
    像昂帕泰·巴这样的老人在非洲有许多，他们通过一个个生动有趣的故事，去讲述人生、启迪后代、排解纠纷。非洲老人不啻一个丰富的文化宝库。
