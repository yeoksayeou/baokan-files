Washington, May 8th (Xinhua News Agency) - The U.S. Space Shuttle "Atlantis" successfully completed its mission and landed safely at the Edwards Air Force Base in California today in the afternoon as scheduled.

By 8th evening, the "Magellan" spacecraft released by "Atlantis" was already more than 700,000 miles away from Earth. What attracted attention was that officials and scientists from the Soviet Union's space department cooperated with their U.S. counterparts for the first time, jointly conducting this exploration of Venus' surface. The Soviet Union provided the U.S. with its latest data on Venus, and in 1990, scientists from both countries will jointly analyze various data and images transmitted back by the "Magellan" spacecraft. According to the plan, in the coming years, the U.S. and the Soviet Union will continue to cooperate in planetary exploration.

　　顺利完成试验任务    
    美航天飞机安全返回
    本报华盛顿５月８日电  记者张亮报道：美国“亚特兰蒂斯”号航天飞机顺利完成其使命后，今天下午按预定时间在加利福尼亚州爱德华兹空军基地安全着陆。
    到８日晚，“亚特兰蒂斯”号航天飞机释放的“麦哲伦”宇航器已距离地球７０多万英里。引起人们注意的是，苏联负责宇航部门的官员和科学家首次与美国同行合作，共同进行这次对金星表层的探测。苏联向美国提供了它搜集的有关金星的最新数据，１９９０年两国科学家还将一起分析“麦哲伦”宇航器传回的各种数据和图像。根据计划，今后数年内美苏两国将继续在星球探测方面进行合作。
