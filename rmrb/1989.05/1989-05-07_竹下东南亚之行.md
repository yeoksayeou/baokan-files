Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita's Southeast Asia Tour

By Yu Qing, Correspondent of this newspaper

On May 7, Japanese Prime Minister Takeshita returned to Tokyo from Manila, concluding his five-nation tour of Southeast Asia. Perhaps by coincidence, the first country Takeshita visited after becoming prime minister and the last country he visited before stepping down were both the Philippines. Before his departure, Takeshita, who had initially considered canceling the trip, accepted advice from diplomats to proceed with the visit, aiming to demonstrate Japan's consistent policy towards Southeast Asia.

Southeast Asia holds a significant position in Japan's economy. Japan imports 80% of its crude oil and approximately 40% of its imported and exported goods pass through the Malacca Strait in Southeast Asia. In recent years, Japan's economic interests in the region have been increasing. Japanese private enterprises' direct investments account for 25% to 40% of foreign investments in the countries of the region, and Japanese government development aid to the region constitutes about 35% of the total aid funds. Therefore, the stability and security of the Southeast Asian region have always been of concern to Japan.

During this visit, Takeshita primarily exchanged views with the host country leaders on the Cambodian issue. Takeshita proposed Japan's four-point stance on the Cambodian issue: first, under international supervision, ensure the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and prevent the recurrence of past inhumane policies; second, achieve self-determination for the Cambodian people through fair and free elections, establishing a truly independent, neutral, and non-aligned Cambodia; third, implement effective international supervision to achieve the above goals; fourth, any political solution must ensure domestic security in Cambodia while fully considering the security of neighboring countries. He also expressed Japan's willingness to provide the necessary funds, personnel, and materials for implementing international supervision. After achieving a political solution, Japan will also cooperate in the reconstruction and development of the region. It is clear that Japan's stance and wishes are based on economic strength and future economic interests.

Southeast Asian countries primarily expect Japan to improve economic relations. During his visit, Takeshita's economic actions mainly focused on promoting the concept of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. To this end, he proposed three principles for Japan on Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation: first, respect the views of ASEAN countries; second, strengthen the maintenance of a free trade system; third, promote multi-faceted and practical economic cooperation. Opinions suggest that although Japan's three principles lack specific content, they can be seen as a trial to gauge the reaction of Southeast Asian countries to the proposal by Japan and other countries to hold an Asia-Pacific economic cooperation ministerial meeting. However, most ASEAN leaders are not interested in forming a regional economic bloc.

Takeshita repeatedly assured the host country leaders that despite his impending resignation as prime minister, Japan's policy of valuing ASEAN countries will not change. ASEAN countries are one of Japan's most important economic cooperation partners, emphasizing that both sides should "think together and act together."

What is noteworthy is the commentary by local analysts on Takeshita's visit: amid escalating economic friction between Japan and the United States and improving Sino-Soviet relations, Japan is bound to feel a sense of isolation. Takeshita's visit and Foreign Minister Uno's visit to the Soviet Union are "coordinated." Uno's visit to the Soviet Union aims to confirm the impact of Sino-Soviet rapprochement on Japan. Takeshita's Southeast Asia tour is aimed at seeking partners and avoiding the consequences of isolation.

　　竹下东南亚之行
    本报记者  于青
    ５月７日，日本首相竹下登结束了东南亚５国之行，从马尼拉回到东京。也许是历史的巧合，竹下就任首相后最先访问的国家和辞职前最后访问的国家竟都是菲律宾。临行前，一度想取消出访的竹下接受了外交界人士的劝告：通过访问，表现日本对东南亚政策的连续性。
    东南亚在日本经济中占有重要地位。日本进口原油的８０％，进出口产品约４０％都要经过东南亚的马六甲海峡。近年来，日本在该地区经济利益日趋增加，日本民间企业直接投资已占外国在该地区各国投资的２５％—４０％，日本政府在该地区投入的开发援助资金占该资金总额的３５％左右。因此，东南亚地区的稳定和安全，一直为日本所关注。
    竹下此行，在政治方面，主要围绕柬埔寨问题与东道国首脑交换意见。竹下提出了日本对柬埔寨问题的四点主张：一，在国际监督下，确保实现越南完全撤军和防止再次出现过去的非人道政策；二，实现柬埔寨人的民族自决，通过公正自由的选举，建立真正独立、中立和不结盟的柬埔寨；三，为达到上述目的，实施有效的国际监督；四，任何政治解决，在确保柬埔寨国内安全的同时，也要充分考虑周围国家的安全保障。他还表示，愿意提供实施国际监督所需要的资金、人员和物资。实现政治解决后，日本对该地区的复兴和开发也将予以合作。显而易见，日本的主张和愿望，是依靠经济实力并兼顾将来经济利益的。
    东南亚国家对日本的期待主要是在改善经济关系方面。竹下在访问中，表现在经济方面的举动主要是推动实现亚太经济合作的构想。为此他提出日本在亚太地区经济合作问题上的三原则：一、尊重东盟各国的看法；二、加强维护自由贸易体制；三、推动多方面的、切实的经济合作。舆论认为，虽然日本提出的三原则缺少实际内容，但可以看作是一种试探，旨在征求东南亚国家对日本等国提议的召开亚太地区经济合作部长会议的反应。但是多数东盟国家领导人对成立区域性经济集团不感兴趣。
    竹下一再向东道国首脑表示，尽管他不久将辞去首相职务，但日本重视东盟国家的政策不会改变，东盟各国是日本经济合作的最重要伙伴之一，强调双方应该“共同思考、共同行动”。
    引人注意的倒是此间评论家为竹下出访目的所做的注脚：在日美经济摩擦日趋激化，中苏关系改善的大气候中，日本难免产生某种孤立感。竹下此行与外相宇野访问苏联是“配套”的，宇野访苏意在确认中苏和解对日本有无影响。竹下东南亚之行，是争取伙伴，避免形影相吊的后果。　　　（东京５月７日电）
