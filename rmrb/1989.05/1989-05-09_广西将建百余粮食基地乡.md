Guangxi to Build Over a Hundred Grain Production Base Townships

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 9th (Reporter Deng Guotian): Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region will allocate 50 million yuan in special funds to establish 163 grain production base townships, aiming to enhance the self-sufficiency of grain in rural areas.

Guangxi is located in the tropical and subtropical regions, with a landscape characterized by "eight parts mountains, one part water, and one part fields." It is not suitable for large-scale grain production bases, but developing small, regional bases is feasible. Currently, the 163 grain production base townships initially identified across the entire autonomous region have a grain sowing area of approximately 3 million mu. The primary goal is to encourage townships and towns to increase their grain self-sufficiency rate and reduce the need for grain imports.
