At the closing ceremony of the "Bei Ran Cup" National Youth Go Invitational Tournament held today, Nie Weiping, the Go Saint, sounded the alarm for the future of Chinese Go. He believes that the level of Chinese youth players is not as high as that of South Korea, and a severe challenge is inevitable.

This tournament gathered 42 outstanding young players from 19 provinces, cities, and three industry sports associations. After awarding the winners, Nie Weiping, who served as the tournament's organizing committee chairman, suddenly asked the winners, "Who among you has the strength to win the national championship?" "We don't," he said, "but South Korea has a 13-year-old child who not only won the championship in a major tournament but also successfully challenged top players multiple times. Your future opponents on the international stage will definitely be stronger than those we faced."

However, Nie Weiping also believes that the widespread promotion of Go in recent years has provided the conditions to face future severe challenges. The key is that everyone should not be complacent, especially young players who should not be self-satisfied and must strive for progress.

　　聂卫平为中国围棋敲警钟   
    激励青少年棋手勇于进取
    本报北京５月８日讯  在今天举行的“北染杯”全国少年精英围棋邀请赛闭幕式上，聂卫平棋圣为中国的围棋事业大敲警钟。他认为，我少年棋手水平不如南朝鲜，严峻的挑战已势所难免。
    这次比赛汇聚了１９省市和三个行业体协的４２名优秀少年棋手。在向优胜者颁奖之后，担任比赛组委会主任的聂卫平忽发奇问，他问获奖者：你们谁有夺取全国冠军的实力？“我们没有，可南朝鲜就有一位十三岁棋童，不仅拿了大赛桂冠，还多次成功地向一流棋手挑战。你们今后在国际赛场上的对手，肯定会比我们遇到的更强。”
    不过，聂卫平又认为，近年来国内围棋运动的大普及，已为迎接日后的严峻挑战提供了条件。关键是大家都不要安于现状，尤其是少年棋手们不可自满，要勇于进取。
