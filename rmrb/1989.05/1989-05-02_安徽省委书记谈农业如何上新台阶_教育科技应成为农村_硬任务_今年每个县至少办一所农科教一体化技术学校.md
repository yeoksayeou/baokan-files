Anhui Provincial Party Secretary Discusses How to Elevate Agriculture to a New Level

Education and Technology Should Become a "Hard Task" for Rural Areas

Each County to Establish at Least One Integrated Agricultural, Scientific, and Educational Technical School This Year

BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) — Anhui Provincial Party Secretary Lu Rongxing recently discussed with a reporter new ideas on how to develop Anhui's agriculture—by promoting the coordinated development of agriculture, science, and education, agriculture can be elevated to a new level.

He first cited an example: the hometown of the famous educator Tao Xingzhi, Anhui Province's Xuning County, has established six vocational schools over the past 10 years, offering 18 practical technical majors such as forestry, tea, and agriculture, and training more than 1,900 technical personnel. Many of them have become successful entrepreneurs. As a result, agriculture, science, and education have all developed, transforming the situation from "each doing their own thing" to "three in harmony."

He strongly advocated for the coordinated development of agriculture, science, and education, with compelling reasons: Over the past eight years, the province has had an average of 800,000 middle and primary school students entering rural areas and society each year. Although they have some education, they lack professional skills. In the past seven years, the number of graduates from rural vocational schools has only accounted for 1.3% of junior and senior high school graduates. Various places have invested heavily in cultivating less than 10% of students to attend high school and university, while for the more than 90% who cannot continue their studies and return to the countryside, the investment is too little, creating a stark contrast. The main reasons, according to Lu Rongxing, are: first, we have not yet treated education and technology as a "hard task" for developing the rural economy, but rather as treating symptoms rather than the root cause; second, traditional concepts are too heavy, always guiding students to rush towards the "narrow bridge" (referring to university entrance examinations); third, the system is not smooth, on the one hand, rural talents are in short supply, on the other hand, talents are also wasted and accumulated.

Lu Rongxing revealed that the Anhui Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have taken measures. In terms of the overall plan, he is responsible for the design; in terms of specific implementation, the Provincial Government has designated three vice governors to coordinate and manage. This year, each county should establish at least one to several integrated agricultural, scientific, and educational vocational technical schools.

　　安徽省委书记谈农业如何上新台阶    
    教育科技应成为农村“硬任务”     
    今年每个县至少办一所农科教一体化技术学校
    本报合肥５月２日电  记者张振国报道：安徽省委书记卢荣景日前就安徽农业发展问题向记者谈了他的新思路——促使农科教协调发展，才能把农业推上一个新台阶。
    他首先举了一例：著名教育家陶行知先生的家乡——安徽省休宁县，１０年来办了６所职业中学，开设了林业、茶叶、农艺等１８个实用技术专业，培养各类技术人才１９００多名，不少人已成为致富能手。其结果是农、科、教都得到发展，变“各顾各”为“三吻合”。
    他力主农、科、教协调发展的理由很充分：近８年中，全省平均每年约有８０万名中、小学生走向农村、走向社会，虽有一定文化，但无专业技能。而近７年，毕业于农村职业中学的人数，只占初、高中毕业生的１．３％。各地都把本钱花在培养不到１０％的学生读高中、升大学上，而对９０％以上不能升学的回乡学生则本钱花得太少，形成强烈的反差。究其主要原因，卢荣景认为：一是我们尚没有把教育和科技当作发展农村经济的“硬任务”来抓，而是头痛医头，脚痛医脚；二是传统观念太重，总是习惯于引导学生千军万马去闯“独木桥”（指考大学）；三是体制不顺，一方面农村人才奇缺，一方面人才又积压浪费。
    卢荣景透露，安徽省委、省政府已采取措施，在总的构想上，由他承担设计；在具体落实上，省府已确定三位副省长协调分管。今年，每个县至少要办起一所到几所农、科、教一体化的职业技术学校。
