The world of women's tennis is highly monopolized, with significant gaps in skill levels among players. American athletes Navratilova and Evert have long dominated the tennis world as the highest-level players. Initially, Evert was the top player, but later Navratilova took the lead. Throughout their era, no other player could challenge these two "queens." Their "duet" on the world tennis stage continued until they were in their mid-thirties.

Eventually, they found rivals. However, it was a coincidence that these new challengers were also two individuals: Graf from West Germany and Sabatini from Argentina. Last year, the ranking of women's tennis players was: Graf, Navratilova, Sabatini, and Evert. The two young stars began to catch up and surpass the veterans, while the two veterans were not yet showing signs of aging and could still compete for a few more years.

Both Graf and Sabatini are under twenty years old. This means that currently, there are no players in the world of women's tennis between the ages of twenty and thirty. The public believes that Graf and Sabatini will likely dominate the tennis world for the next ten years.

The period of transition between the old and new generations is also a time when two generations of stars shine together. Currently, the world of women's tennis features two generations of stars, four "queens," all shining brightly.

　　四大明星交辉  网坛新老争霸
    世界女子网球的垄断性极强，选手们水平相差悬殊。美国的纳芙拉蒂洛娃和埃弗特曾作为世界上水平最高的运动员称霸网坛多年。最初，埃弗特是头号选手，后来纳芙拉蒂洛娃占了上风。与她们同时代的选手中始终没有谁把这两位“女皇”拉下马。她俩在世界网坛上的“二人转”一直唱到三十岁出头。
    后来，她俩终于有了对手。但碰巧的是，新对手也是两个人：西德的格拉芙和阿根廷的萨巴蒂尼。去年，世界女子网球的排名顺序是：格拉芙、纳芙拉蒂洛娃、萨巴蒂尼和埃弗特。两位新秀开始赶上并超过老将，而两位老将尚未“老态龙钟”，甚至可以再打上几年。
    格拉芙和萨巴蒂尼均未满二十岁。也就是说，目前的世界女子网坛上二十至三十岁之间的选手是个空白。舆论界认为，格拉芙和萨巴蒂尼大概也会称霸十年。
    新老交接的时期，更是两代球星交相辉映的时代。眼下的世界女子网坛，两代明星、四大“皇后”同放异彩。　　　　　　　　阿竹
