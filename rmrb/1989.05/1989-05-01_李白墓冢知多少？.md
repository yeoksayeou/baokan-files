The poem "The Clothes Tomb of Li Bai" in the "Dadi" supplement of the People's Daily on May 28, 1988, praises Li Bai's clothes tomb. But where is his real tomb? How many of Li Bai's tombs are there now?

Li Bai's real tomb is located at the western foot of Qing Shan (also known as Xie Gong Shan) in Dangtu County, Anhui Province. In the second year of the Tang Dynasty's Shangyuan era (761 AD), Li Bai visited Dangtu for the seventh time from Jiankang (present-day Nanjing) and stayed with his cousin, the county magistrate Li Yangbing. The following year, he died in Dangtu due to an illness known as "fubi." Initially, he was buried at the eastern foot of Long Shan. Later, because Qing Shan, which is across the river from Long Shan, was a place Li Bai admired since his youth, at the end of the Yuanhe era of the Tang Dynasty, Li Bai's friend Fan Lian's son, Fan Chuanzheng, moved his tomb to this location. The tomb still exists today. It is a round mound with stones piled around it. There are two stele in front, one inscribed "Tomb of the Famous Scholar of the Tang Dynasty, Li Taibai," and the other inscribed with Fan Chuanzheng's stele inscription from the second year of the Song Dynasty's Chunyou era (1242 AD). The tomb is surrounded by ancient trees, making it an exceptionally secluded and strange place. An anonymous ancient poem says: "A handful of soil by the Jiangkou River, Li Bai's poetic fame shines through the ages. Those who come and go write a couplet, dropping the axe in front of Lu Ban's door."

In addition to Li Bai's real tomb, there are two clothes tombs. One is located on the slope of Cuiluo Mountain in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province. The base of this tomb is built with green stones and is about 2 meters high. In front, there is a large white marble stele inscribed "Clothes Tomb of the Great Poet of the Tang Dynasty, Li Bai." It is said that Li Bai, while drunk, jumped into the river to catch the moon and drowned. His clothes fell into the river, and fishermen retrieved them, initially storing them in the ancient Shengxiao Temple in Caishi Town (now part of Ma'anshan City), and later moving them to this location. Another is located in the Mingxian Temple inside Qinglian Scenic Area, 15 kilometers southwest of Jiangyou City, Sichuan Province. It was built by the people of Siming County in the eighth year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty (1869). The "Siming County Gazette" records: "Taibai has a tomb, but the tomb is not in Shu; however, the people of Siming say this is his native place, so they decided to build a clothes tomb, and prepared clothes and hats according to the Tang Dynasty's customs."

In 1963, it was repaired, and the tombstone was restored. The inscription on the stele reads "Clothes Tomb of Li Bai of the Tang Dynasty." The tomb is surrounded by a fence, with tall and lush pine and cypress trees.

### 李白墓冢知多少？

　　李白墓冢知多少？
    李丰旺
    《人民日报》１９８８年５月２８日“大地”副刊“太白衣冠冢”一诗歌咏李白衣冠冢，那他的真冢在什么地方呢？李白冢现存多少呢？
    李白的真冢在今安徽省当涂县的青山（又名谢公山）西麓。唐上元二年（公元７６１年），李白由金陵（今南京）第七次游当涂，投靠他的族叔——当涂县县令李阳冰。次年，因“腐胁疾”病发，卒于当涂。初葬于龙山东麓，后因与龙山隔河相望的青山，是李白生年倾慕之地，唐元和末年，由李白好友范伦之子范传正将其墓迁葬于此。今日墓尚存，墓为一圆冢，旁砌以石块，前存二碑，一为“唐名贤李太白之墓”，一为刻有范传正当年所撰碑文的碑，为宋淳祐二年（公元１２４２年）遗物。墓围古树掩翳，胜幽异常。关于此墓，古代无名氏有打油诗云：“采石江边一抔土，李白诗名耀千古。来的去的写两行，鲁班门前掉大斧。”
    除李白真冢外，李白还有两个衣冠冢。一个在安徽马鞍山市翠螺山腰。该冢基用青石垒砌，高约２米，前有白色大理石碑，镌刻“唐大诗人李白衣冠冢”。相传李白酒醉跳江捉月溺死，衣冠落入江中，渔民捞起，初藏于当涂采石镇（今属马鞍山市）古神霄宫，后迁至此处。另一个在四川省江油县城西南１５公里处李白故里青莲场名贤祠内。清同治八年（１８６９年）彰明县里人兴建。《彰明县志》载：“太白固有墓，墓并不在蜀；而彰明人曰此固其桑梓地也，于是相议为衣冠墓，具章服如唐制。”
    １９６３年曾修葺，恢复了墓碑，碑文为“唐李白衣冠墓”。墓周置有围栏，松柏苍翠，枝叶扶疏。
