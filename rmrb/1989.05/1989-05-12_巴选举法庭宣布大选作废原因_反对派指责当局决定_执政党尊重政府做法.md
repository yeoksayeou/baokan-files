Xinhua News Agency, Panama City, May 11th

The Panama Election Court issued an order on the 10th stating that due to numerous irregularities in the May 7th general election, the court has decided to nullify the election results.

Election Court President Yolanda Prisco stated in a broadcast on the same day that U.S. and other foreign observers had set up "obstacles" for the election. Their "clear purpose" in coming to Panama was to gather "evidence" for the "election fraud" that the U.S. had already propagated to the world. As a result, the normal order of the election was disrupted, leading to numerous irregularities such as the loss of voter registration lists. He emphasized that under these circumstances, declaring any candidate victorious was "absolutely impossible." Therefore, the "entire" election was invalid.

In recent days, the opposition party and the ruling party have had differing views on the results of the May 7th election, each claiming victory.

It is understood that the decision to nullify the election results was made after a lengthy meeting of the Panama State Council. Panama President Francisco Rodriguez and all cabinet members, Defense Forces Commander Manuel Noriega, and most members of the Defense Forces General Staff participated in this meeting.

People's Daily, Mexico City, May 11th

Reporter Guo Weicheng: The Panamanian opposition, the Democratic Opposition Alliance, insisted today that the alliance had won the election and opposed the government's decision to declare the election invalid. The Panamanian opposition claimed to have won with a 3:1 margin and accused the authorities of declaring the election invalid as a "political act of desperation."

According to another report, one of Panama's largest ruling parties, the Democratic Revolutionary Party, stated on the 11th that although it disagreed with the government's decision to nullify the May 7th election, it respected the government's decision.

Democratic Revolutionary Party Secretary-General Espino said at a press conference today that when the government announced the suspension of vote counting, the victory of the ruling National Liberation Alliance in the election was already certain. He believes that the U.S.'s open interference in Panama's election was the main reason the government declared the election invalid.

　　巴选举法庭宣布大选作废原因    
    反对派指责当局决定　执政党尊重政府做法
    新华社巴拿马城５月１１日电  巴拿马选举法庭１０日颁布一项法令说，由于５月７日的大选中存在许多不正常现象，法庭决定宣布这次大选结果作废。
    选举法庭庭长约兰达·普利塞在当天发表的广播电视讲话中说，美国和其他许多外国观察员为这次选举设置了“障碍”。他们来巴拿马的“明显目的”，是要为美国早就向世界宣传的“选举舞弊”搜集“证词”。这样，选举的正常秩序遭到干扰，因而出现了诸如选票登记簿遗失等许多不正常现象。他强调，在这种情况下，宣布任何一个竞选人获胜都是“绝对不可能的”。因此，“整个”大选是无效的。
    近日来，围绕５月７日大选结果问题，反对党和执政党各执一词，双方都称自己在大选中获胜。
    据悉，宣布大选结果作废的决定，是在巴拿马国务委员会举行了长时间会议之后做出的。巴拿马总统帕尔马和全体内阁成员、国防军司令诺列加及国防军参谋部大部分成员参加了这次会议。
    本报墨西哥城５月１１日电　记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马反对派的公民反对派民主联盟今天坚持声称该联盟已经在大选中获胜，反对当局宣布大选无效。巴拿马反对派声称已经以３∶１的得票获胜，指责当局宣布大选无效是“政治上的绝望”。
    另据报道，巴拿马最大的执政党之一——民主革命党１１日表示，尽管它对政府宣布７日大选无效的做法持异议，但它尊重政府的决定。
    民主革命党总书记埃斯皮诺今天在记者招待会上说，在政府宣布中止统计选票的时候，执政的民族解放联盟大选获胜已成定局。他认为，美国公开干涉巴拿马大选是巴政府宣布大选无效的主要原因。
