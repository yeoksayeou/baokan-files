The car leaves Chengdu, passes through Ya'an, and heads south, crossing the snow-covered Muddy Mountain and passing through Shichuan County, where the Red Army crossed the Dadu River. We then enter the territory of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan.

It is spring, and the azaleas have turned half the mountains red. The flatlands at the foot of the mountains are covered with golden rapeseed flowers, shining brightly among the green wheat and broad bean seedlings. The accompanying reporters all exclaimed in admiration. Perhaps influenced by Zhuge Liang's "Outward Expedition Memorandum," many of us, including myself, had thought that the Liangshan area was a "barren land" of "poor mountains and evil waters." Now we realize that this is a great misunderstanding.

The Cool Mountains are not cool. During our 20-day visit to the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, we felt everywhere a strong drive to develop production and the commodity economy, full of vigor and vitality.

It was a cloudy morning when we visited several Yi farmers in the deep mountains of Zhao Jue County, Ma Gu Shan. Ma Bil, 52, was herding over 60 sheep on the hillside, cradling a lamb in his arms. "If you ask about income, the imported improved sheep have done well. Last year, selling wool and sheep brought in over 2,400 yuan, and just this item alone gave a per capita income of over 480 yuan for the family of five." He said, calculating as he spoke, his face beaming with smiles. A county official nearby added, "For those who excel in grass planting and livestock raising, the best is Bi Er Lu Qu in Bi Er District. A few years ago, his family had a per capita income of over 1,000 yuan, and last year it was nearly 2,000 yuan; he has also led 15 households to become wealthy by planting grass and raising sheep."

The Yi farmers in Zhao Jue County have only recently become wealthy through grass planting and livestock raising. In the past, Liangshan blindly followed the trend of hot mountains, destroying grass and forests, clearing land for grain. As a result, the original vegetation was destroyed, grasslands degraded, and the more they cleared, the poorer they became. Livestock development stagnated, and they could not even achieve basic sustenance. Having learned from their mistakes, in recent years they have made efforts to develop grain production while vigorously promoting grass planting and livestock raising, and actively introducing grass seeds from abroad and promoting improved sheep breeds. Zhao Jue County has now become a major production base for semi-fine wool in China. In just a few years, the county's grain production has increased from less than 200 kilograms per person to over 400 kilograms, exceeding the national average; livestock inventory has increased from 350,000 to over 600,000, nearly doubling. These are undoubtedly significant progress.

"Money-making land," the people of Liangshan have changed their traditional slash-and-burn farming methods, planting grass and raising livestock on hillside slopes, and planting economic trees such as apples and Sichuan pepper. They have given it this vivid and down-to-earth name. Under the guidance of the prefecture party committee and government, last year the entire prefecture built 10.2 million mu of "money-making land," accumulating a total of over 43 million mu. On the hillside of Tan Shan Village in Xi De County, 62-year-old Ji Ri A Niu talked about his "money-making land" and found it interesting and amusing. Many years ago, he accidentally planted an apple tree in front of his house, which inspired him. Later, with the encouragement of the county, he led his four children to plant over 1,900 apple trees on the mountain. He began to benefit from it a few years ago, and last year he harvested over 4,000 kilograms of apples, earning nearly 3,000 yuan. He pointed to the patch of fruit trees on the mountain and said, "With this, our family can gradually become wealthy." In Yan Yuan County's Man Po Zi, seeing the tens of thousands of mu of apple tree seedlings on the barren slopes truly makes one's heart soar. The various counties in Liangshan Prefecture provide demonstrations and scientific and technological guidance for farmers to build "money-making land," and also implement some supportive policies.

Some people say that the Yi people are a race ashamed of commerce. They say that when selling a chicken, they hide it in something similar to a cloak called "cha er wa," only exposing the chicken's head. In fact, this is because of poverty. Basic sustenance could not be solved, and their stomachs were not full, so how could they have commodities to exchange? With the development of production, the Yi people also have surplus products, and they need markets and exchanges. In Zhao Jue County, before 1978, there were only 3 commodity markets, but now there are 13, with transactions amounting to several million yuan. Pu Ge County had no commodity markets in the past, but in recent years, 8 have gradually formed, and the market days have changed from once a month to every half month or every 10 days. In the commodity markets, we saw Yi women engaging in sewing, processing, and other service businesses, appearing shrewd and enthusiastic. It is said that this is an unprecedented and unheard-of novelty in Liangshan.

Opening the mountain and village gates has also broken the long-term closed and stagnant situation in Liangshan. The history of Liangshan having mines but no iron, having silkworms but no silk, and having tobacco but no cigarettes has come to an end. In recent years, they have established economic relations with 33 regions, signed 310 cooperation projects, introduced over 900 talents and over 300 million yuan in funds, and established a relatively complete industrial system of coordinated development of light and heavy industries, including steel mills, silk mills, and leather factories. They have also established friendly relations with 8 countries and regions.

In Liangshan Prefecture, we also heard good news that experts and local officials are discussing the agricultural development plan for the Anning River basin within the prefecture. This is also something the Yi people in Liangshan have longed for. The Anning River basin is a high-altitude, low-latitude region with abundant light, heat, and water resources. This area has over 21 mu of land per person, with over 80 million mu of wasteland resources and over 120 million mu of arable wasteland, all of which can be planted twice a year. According to the assessment, if the agricultural development of the Anning River basin is well done, it can provide 1.9 billion kilograms of commercial grain, 1.5 billion kilograms of sugarcane, and a large amount of tobacco leaves, silkworm cocoons, fruits, and early special vegetables annually. Sichuan's population is increasing by over a million people each year, while arable land is decreasing by over 300,000 mu each year, and agricultural production has long been stagnant. The agricultural development of the Anning River region is undoubtedly of great significance to Liangshan and Sichuan.

The Yi people in Liangshan respect the national hero Zhi Ge A Long. It is said that he is the son of an eagle, wise and brave, punishing evil and creating a homeland. Today, this remote national eagle of Liangshan has spread its wings. But it cannot be said to have taken off. Because it indeed carries the heavy burden of history, social productivity and the commodity economy are still very underdeveloped, the lives of the people are still quite low, and the treasures bestowed by nature have not been fully utilized. People look forward to and believe that this eagle will follow the trend of reform and opening up, take off in the sky of the motherland as soon as possible, and make its own positive contributions.

　　凉山不凉
    本报记者  吴学林
    汽车出成都市，经雅安掉头南行，翻越积雪的泥巴山，过当年红军强渡大渡河经过的石棉县，就进入了四川凉山彝族自治州境内。
    正是阳春季节，杜鹃花映红了半匹山；山岭下面的平坝地带盛开着金黄色油菜花，在碧绿的小麦和蚕豆苗中泛出光彩；同行记者都对这景色赞叹不已。大概是受诸葛亮《出师表》的影响，包括我在内的不少人都以为凉山一带是“不毛之地”、“穷山恶水”，现在方知是极大的误解。
    凉山不凉。我们在凉山彝族自治州采访的２０多天中，到处都感受到一股大力发展生产和商品经济的热乎劲头和活力。
    那是一个阴天上午，在大凉山深处的昭觉县马姑山，我访问几户彝族农民。５２岁的玛比尔，赶着６０多头绵羊在山坡放牧，怀里还搂着一个小羊羔。“要问收入么，引进的改良绵羊立了功，去年卖羊毛和羊收入２４００多元，单这一项全家５口人平收入就有４８０多元。”他边算边说，满面笑容。县里同志在旁插话说，种草养畜出众者要数比尔区的阿底洛曲，他一家前几年就人平收入上千元，去年人平收入近两千元；他还带动１５户农民种草养羊致富。
    昭觉县彝族农民靠种草养羊致富是近几年才有的事。过去，凉山盲目跟着热山跑，毁草、毁林、开荒种粮。结果，原生植被破坏，草场退化，越开越穷，岂但牲畜发展停滞，也不得温饱。吃了苦头，这些年不同了，他们努力发展粮食生产的同时，大力提倡种草养畜，并积极从国外引进草种和推广优良羊种。昭觉县现在成了我国紧缺的半细羊毛生产基地。几年之内，全县的粮食生产由人均不过２００公斤增长到４００多公斤，超过全国人均水平；牲畜存栏由３５万头增长到６０多万头，几乎翻了一番。这些不能不说是一个大进步。
    “找钱地”，凉山人改变刀耕火种的耕作传统，在山地坡上种草养畜，种植苹果、花椒等经济林木，给它取了这么一个通俗生动的名字。在州委和州政府的倡导下，去年全州建设“找钱地”１０２万亩，累计已达到４３０多万亩。在喜德县碳山村的坡地上，６２岁的吉日阿牛兴老汉谈起他的“找钱地”觉得有趣和好笑。他多年前偶然在房前栽一株苹果树得到启发，后来在县里鼓励下，带领４个孩子在山上种植１９００多株苹果树，前年开始受益，去年摘苹果４０００多公斤，收入近３０００元。他指着山上一片果树说：“靠它，我们家就能逐渐富起来。”在盐源县的慢坡子，看到那荒坡上种植的上万亩苹果树苗，真叫人心旷神怡。凉山州各县对农民建设“找钱地”，提供示范，给予科学技术指导，还采取一些扶持政策。
    有人说，凉山彝族是一个耻于经商的民族，他们卖一只鸡，也要藏在一种类似披风的“察尔瓦”里，只把鸡头露在外面。实际上，这是因为贫困，温饱尚且不能解决，肚子都填不饱，哪有商品去交换呢？随着生产的发展，彝胞手中有了多余的产品，他们同样需要市场和交换。在昭觉县，１９７８年以前只有３个集贸市场，现在已发展到１３个，成交额达好几百万元。普格县过去没有集贸市场，这些年已逐渐形成８个，场期也由一月一次逐渐改为半月或１０天一次。在集贸市场上，我们看到彝族妇女进行缝纫、加工等服务性营业，显得精明热情，据说这是凉山见所未见闻所未闻的新鲜事。
    打开山门、寨门，也打破了凉山长期封闭徘徊的局面。凉山有矿无铁、有蚕无丝、有烤烟无卷烟的历史从此结束了。这几年，他们同３３个地区建立经济关系，签订３１０个协作项目，引进各种人才９００多人和资金３亿多元，兴办了钢厂、绸厂、皮革厂等门类比较齐全的轻重工业协调发展的工业体系。他们还同８个国家和地区建立了友好往来。
    在凉山州，我们还听到一个喜讯，有关专家和地方负责同志正在讨论境内安宁河流域地区的农业开发规划。这也是凉山彝胞渴望已久的事。安宁河流域是一片高海拔、低纬度地区，光、热和水资源丰富。这一带人平土地达２１亩多，有荒地资源８００多万亩，宜农荒地１２０多万亩，都可以一年两季种植。据论证，搞好安宁河流域地区农业开发，每年可提供商品粮１９亿公斤，甘蔗１５亿公斤，还可提供大量烟叶、蚕茧、水果和早特蔬菜。四川人口每年以上百万速度增长，而耕地以每年３０多万亩速度减少，农业生产长期徘徊不前，安宁河地区的农业开发，应当说对凉山和四川都有重要意义。
    凉山彝胞崇敬民族英雄支格阿龙。传说他是鹰的儿子，机智勇敢，惩治邪恶，创建了家园。如今凉山这只边远民族雄鹰已张开翅膀。但还不能说是起飞。因为它毕竟因袭了沉重的历史负担，社会生产力和商品经济还很不发达，群众生活还相当低下，大自然恩赐的宝藏远远没有充分利用，人们期待并相信这只雄鹰会顺应改革开放的发展势头，早日在祖国天空飞翔，做出自己的积极贡献。
