Leaders Must Rectify Themselves

After reading the report "The Good Atmosphere at Shanxi Aluminum Plant," I deeply feel that today, when we emphasize clean governance and rectifying the party's and society's winds, the key lies in leaders being strict with themselves and setting a good example.

Various improper practices within the party and society, especially some corrupt phenomena in party and government organs, are among the issues that people discuss the most and have the strongest opinions about. However, some leading cadres, while loudly condemning improper practices, themselves engage in such practices. They even use the party's and society's problems as excuses for their wrongdoings. How can such hypocrisy be convincing?

Whether a department or unit has good or improper practices depends first on the leaders. Do they act uprightly and sit correctly? "If one's conduct is correct, orders are not needed; if one's conduct is not correct, even orders will not be followed." As long as leaders truly practice clean governance, care for the people, and wholeheartedly work on reform and modernization, the people will support them. Even if bonuses are less and work is harder, they can endure it. What is worrying is that some leaders demand that the people "strictly require themselves" while they themselves abuse power for personal gain and do as they please.

To make leaders strict with themselves, relying solely on their self-awareness is not enough; corresponding systems must be in place. Currently, the effective practice being piloted is the open office system and open office results, relying on public supervision. With these "two opens and one supervision," transparency is increased, and any improper behavior by leaders will be exposed. Shanxi Aluminum Plant has made beneficial explorations and attempts in this regard. Otherwise, how can we guarantee that the next director won't live in a ten or eight-room house if the current director lives in a two-and-a-half-room house? What if the next deputy director, unlike the current one, does try to help his daughter get into a technical school? Power without restraint will inevitably lead to corruption, and we have had enough lessons in this regard.

Currently, a complete and effective legal system and democratic institutions cannot be established overnight. Whether leading cadres can be clean and upright to a considerable extent depends on their level of awareness and self-discipline. Should we passively wait for the system to be perfected and for the "big environment" to improve further? Or should we, like the leaders of Shanxi Aluminum Plant, start from ourselves and strive to create a good "small environment"? I believe this is a stern test of the times for leaders at all levels.

　　领导者重在正己
    晓华
    读罢通讯“山西铝厂的好‘气候’”，深感今天讲廉政、讲端正党风和社会风气，关键是领导者要严于律己，率先垂范。
    党内和社会上的种种不正之风，特别是党政机关的一些腐败现象，是当前人们议论最多、意见最大的问题之一。但是，有些领导干部在口口声声抨击不正之风时，自己却又在搞不正之风，甚至把党内、社会上存在的弊端作为自己为非作歹的借口。这样说的是一套，做的又是另一套，怎能令人信服呢？
    一个部门、一个单位风气好不好，正不正，首先应该在领导身上找原因，看他们是否行得直，坐得正。“其身正，不令而行；其身不正，虽令不从。”只要领导真正做到廉洁奉公，关心群众，一心一意搞改革，干四化，群众就拥护，就支持，即使奖金少些，工作苦些，也能承受。怕的就是当领导的一味要群众“严格要求自己”，而自己却以权谋私，为所欲为。
    要使领导者严于律己，只靠领导者的自觉是不够的，必须有相应的制度跟上。目前正在试点、效果较好的做法是公开办事制度，公开办事结果，依靠群众监督。有了这“两公开一监督”，透明度提高了，领导者稍有不轨行为便被“曝光”。山西铝厂正是在这方面进行了有益的探索和尝试。否则，这任厂长住房两间半，谁敢保证下任不住十间八间呢？那位副厂长不为女儿上技校“张张口”，碰上个爱“张张口”的怎么办？失去制约的权力终究要导致腐败，我们在这方面的教训已经够多了。
    现在，一套完整的、富有成效的法制体系和民主制度还不可能一下子建立起来，领导干部能否做到廉洁清正，在相当程度上还取决于他的觉悟水平和自我约束能力。是消极等待制度完备，等待“大气候”进一步好转呢，还是像山西铝厂的领导那样从自身做起、努力创造良好的“小气候”？我以为这是时代对各级领导的一个严峻考验。
