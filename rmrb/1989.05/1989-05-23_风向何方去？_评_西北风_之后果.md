	Where Is the Wind Blowing?
	— An Evaluation of the Aftermath of the "Northwest Wind"

	Eight months ago, I wrote an article titled "From Where Does the Wind Come?" evaluating the "Northwest Wind" music trend that swept the nation. Today, the "Northwest Wind" has subsided in its birthplace, Beijing, and still echoes in some regions outside. "Where is the wind blowing?" has thus become a question worth paying attention to.

	The initial rise of the "Northwest Wind" was primarily characterized by critical and reflective ideas. Works such as "Nothing to My Name," "Ballad of the Plains," "My Beloved Hometown," and "Yellow Earth" encapsulated a generation's genuine feelings and thoughts about history, nation, state, and real life. Although these works also contain an inevitable dependence on history and tradition, they are more critical. Despite some genuine expressions, the main theme returns to romanticism. Although there are excellent works, the ideas can only be said to have regressed.

	In terms of music, early "Northwest Wind" works emphasized rock thinking. However, since the representative works all, to varying degrees, adopted Northern folk music elements, subsequent large-scale creations quickly returned to folk songs and the style of songwriting before the Cultural Revolution.

	In terms of singing, the "Northwest Wind" has led to a consequence. First, there is the masculinization of female voices. If the voices of the early few female singers were still a relatively conscious choice and retained some feminine characteristics, the singers who followed suit gave an abnormal feeling. In contrast, a group of male singers became feminized, showing a terrifyingly comical appearance. More importantly, as shouting singing increased, singers increasingly used this as a commercial means, completely ignoring the inner strength required by this method, thus turning into lifeless shouting.

	Thus, we witnessed the decline of the "Northwest Wind." Its decline, apart from the general aesthetic law of reverse psychology, largely depends on the "Northwest Wind's" own loss. It lies in the fact that its authenticity is replaced by hypocrisy, strength is worn away by indulgence, and human consciousness is swallowed by commercialism.

	Firstly, it is the tragedy of lyricists and composers. Some authors followed the trend, some wrote purely for money, which is not worth mentioning. However, some authors who wrote successful works forgot that they succeeded only because of their authenticity and innovation. Under the powerful impact of the commercial market, they began to let themselves go, selling their talents cheaply to the market. They themselves are secretly suffering from loss, or simply using beautiful words to maintain a fragile balance.

	Secondly, it is the tragedy of singers. Due to the high status of "Northwest Wind" singers in the domestic music scene, the next generation of singers blindly and almost hysterically imitated them, fully exposing the low cultural level of the singer group. No matter how much historical necessity this low level has, it is definitely not a reason for singers to be self-satisfied. To put it bluntly, from the various concerts since last year, it can be seen that the currently popular big stars have almost all entered a state of weightlessness, except for relying on old fame, there is hardly any new creation. This is a loss that cannot be sympathized with.

	Thirdly, it is the tragedy of the audience. The rise and popularity of the "Northwest Wind" is a release of restless emotions of the times. But the blindness and instability of this emotion cannot last long. Our audience cannot truly face the real world and the real self. After the roar, there is only helpless emptiness, and they must find some sweet treats to restore balance. However, once they find that there is no real sugar in these treats, they feel bland. This can somewhat explain the box office decline from south to north.

	Finally, the "Northwest Wind" is a tragedy of ideas. Popular music is different from folk music; it is merely a product of modern industrial civilization, a kind of real culture and lifestyle. Its existence is a balance of emotions in real life. It may take a romanticist approach, or it may take a realist approach; it can create an ideal world to counter the real world, or it can face the real world to prove its existence. In any case, it requires a conscious and authentic approach, while Chinese popular music obviously lacks this consciousness and authenticity. Although it has achieved great success, it should not be self-satisfied.

	Currently, the lyricist and composer team has a sense of crisis but has not taken positive action. The singer team is struggling in commercialism with self-satisfaction.

	Where is the wind blowing? I dare not speculate, but if there is a new wind rising, giving us vitality, it seems to be what we eagerly await.

### 风向何方去？——评“西北风”之后果

　　风向何方去？
    ——评“西北风”之后果
    金兆钧
    八个月前，我曾写过《风从哪里来？》一文，评论了当时席卷全国之“西北风”歌潮。今日，“西北风”在其源头北京已消沉有日，在外地一些区域尚有余响。“风向何方去？”便成了一个值得重视的问题。
    “西北风”崛起之初的主要观念是批判性的，反思性的，《一无所有》、《信天游》、《我热恋的故乡》及《黄土高坡》等作品凝聚着一代人对历史、民族、国家及现实生活的真切感受和思考。作品中虽亦有对历史和传统的无可摆脱的依附性，但更多的是批判的。虽亦不乏几句对真实的表达，主旨却回归到了浪漫主义。虽然不乏佳作，观念上却只能说是倒退。
    在音乐上，早期“西北风”作品强调了摇滚思维，然而由于代表作品均程度不等地采用了北方民间音乐素材，其后的大批创作便迅速向民歌回归，向文革前民歌风创作歌曲的风格回归。
    在歌唱上，“西北风”引出了一种后果。首先是女声的男性化，如果说早期几位女歌手的声音还是一种较自觉的选择而且尚带有女性特点的话，群起而效仿的歌手们就已给人以变态的感觉，而与此相映照，一批男歌手又女性化，表现出一种可怕的滑稽。更重要的是，随着喊唱的增多，歌手们越来越多地以此为商业性手段而完全忽视了这种方法所要求的内在力量，从而变成了毫无生命力的吼叫。
    于是，我们看到了“西北风”的衰落。它的衰落，除去一般审美规律上的逆反心理外，很大程度上取决于“西北风”自身的失落，在于它自身的真实为虚伪所取代，力量被放纵所消磨，人的意识为商业性所吞噬。
    首先，它是词曲作者的悲剧。一些作者随波逐流，一些作者纯为挣钱，自不足论。而一些写出了成功之作的作者忘记了自己仅仅因为真实和创新而成功。他们在商业性市场的强大冲击下开始放任自流，将自身的才华廉价拍卖给市场，自己又在暗中为失落而痛苦，或干脆以漂亮的词句来维持脆弱的平衡。
    其次，它又是歌手的悲剧。由于西北风的重角歌手在国内歌坛地位颇高，于是引起了下一代歌手昏头昏脑且近乎歇斯底里的模仿，充分暴露了歌手队伍文化的低下。不管这种低下有多少历史必然性，它决不是歌手可以自鸣得意的理由。不客气地讲，从去年底各种演唱会上可知，正走红的大歌星们几乎全部进入失重状态，除去吃老本外，罕见新的创造。这是一个无法令人同情的失落。
    再者，它也是听众的悲剧。“西北风”的崛起与风行，是躁动不安的一种时代情绪的宣泄。但这种情绪的盲目性和不稳定性，支持不了多久。我们的听众还不能真正勇敢地面对真实的世界和真实的自我。在狂吼之后就只有无奈的空虚，必须去寻找一点甜点心来恢复平衡。然而一旦发现这点心中没有真糖便又觉得索然无味。这多少可以理解一下从南到北的票房跌落吧。
    最后，“西北风”是一个观念的悲剧。流行音乐毕竟不同于民间音乐，它只是现代工业文明的产物，是一种现实的文化和生活方式，它的存在就是对现实生活的情感平衡。它可能采取浪漫主义的方式，也可能采取现实主义的方式；它可以制造理想的世界来抗衡现实世界，也可以直面现实的世界而证明自我的存在；无论怎样，它都要求一种自觉和真实，而中国的流行音乐显然缺乏这种自觉和真实。尽管它已经取得了很大的成就，但不能因此而自我满足。
    目前，词曲作者队伍虽已有危机感，却还未采取积极的行动。歌手队伍正在商业化的网内洋洋得意地挣扎。
    风向何方去？我不敢妄论，但有新的风又起来，给我们以生气，似乎是我们急切期待的。
