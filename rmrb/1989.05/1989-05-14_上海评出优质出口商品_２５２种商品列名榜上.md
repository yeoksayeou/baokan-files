Shanghai has recently released the list of high-quality export goods for the year 1988. A total of 252 products from 23 industries and companies in the city have been selected.

According to officials from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, these 252 high-quality products generated approximately $800 million in foreign exchange last year, accounting for about 17% of the city's total export earnings. Shanghai's export goods have a certain advantage in quality compared to similar domestic products, with an export commodity inspection pass rate consistently above 96%. Last year, the total amount of compensation paid for export goods was $940,000, showing a downward trend compared to previous years.

However, the official admitted that while Shanghai's export production enterprises have not been found to intentionally adulterate or fake products, there have been serious cases of adulteration in raw materials such as honey, cashmere, peppermint oil, garlic oil, ginger oil, and sesame purchased from other regions. A batch of exported cashmere sweaters was found to have adulterated cashmere from a certain domestic region, resulting in a compensation of $550,000. Quality issues with some export goods remain prominent. In the past three years, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has inspected over 6,000 batches of export products that were found to be non-compliant, valued at over $220 million; due to various issues, $591,000 in compensation was paid abroad, with 69% of the issues related to product quality.

　　上海评出优质出口商品    
    ２５２种商品列名榜上
    本报上海５月１４日电  记者刘士安报道：我国最大的对外贸易口岸上海，日前发布了１９８８年度优质出口商品获奖名单，全市２３个行业系统和公司厂家的２５２种商品名列其中。
    据上海商检局官员介绍，这２５２种优质商品去年共创汇约８亿美元，占全市出口创汇额的１７％左右。在国内同类产品中，上海出口商品质量有一定优势，出口商检批次合格率一直保持在９６％以上。去年全市出口商品对外理赔金额为９４万美元，与以前相比呈下降趋势。
    但是，这位官员承认，虽然上海市出口生产企业尚未发现有意掺假作伪的现象，但从外地收购的原料蜜、羊绒、薄荷油、大蒜油、姜油、芝麻等商品都发现了严重的掺假事件。一批出口羊绒衫因国内某地来的羊绒掺假，造成一次赔偿５５万美元。一些出口商品的质量问题仍然突出。上海商检局近三年来检验的出口产品有６０００多批不合格，价值２．２亿多美元；因各种问题对外赔偿５９１万美元，其中６９％属于品质问题。
