Soviet Military Chief Discusses Army Building

	The Soviet Chief of the General Staff, Marshal Moiseyev, stated in the recently published 9th issue of the bi-weekly "Government News" that the reduction of the Soviet military by 500,000 will not harm the country's defense capabilities. The Soviet armed forces are always ready to repel any aggressor.

	He pointed out that Soviet soldiers have received a high level of education. After leaving the army, they can contribute to the national economy in fields such as radio electronics, nuclear energy, electrical engineering, and applied mathematics. Another part of the demobilized soldiers will undergo retraining to improve their specific professional skills.

	To settle the demobilized soldiers, local Soviets are responsible for arranging their employment and providing housing. The Ministry of Defense will, within the next two years, build over 100 apartment buildings with 60-80 units each for demobilized soldiers.

	The Soviet Chief of the General Staff does not advocate changing the current conscription system to a volunteer-based mercenary system, as the latter does not conform to the principles of building an army in a socialist country. The Soviet Constitution stipulates that every citizen has the duty to defend the motherland.

	Moiseyev also stated that military-industrial enterprises under the Soviet Ministry of Defense should quickly shift to producing civilian products, with production this year expected to double compared to last year. In 1990, production should double again compared to 1988. It is estimated that in 1990, the troops, agencies, enterprises, and organizations under the Soviet Ministry of Defense will provide nearly 500 million rubles worth of paid services to residents.

　　苏军总长谈苏军队建设    
    不主张改义务兵役制为雇佣兵制 
    今年军转民企业产量应该翻一番
    新华社莫斯科电  苏军总参谋长莫伊谢耶夫大将在刚出版的第９期《政府新闻》双周刊上表示，苏联裁军５０万不会损害国防能力，苏联武装力量时刻准备着击退任何侵略者。
    他指出，苏联军人受过高水平的教育，他们离开部队后，可使国民经济部门增加有关无线电电子、核能、电工、应用数学等部门的专家。另外一部分退役军人则要接受再教育，提高具体专业的熟练技能。
    为了安置退役军人，地方苏维埃要负责安排他们的就业，并向他们提供住房。国防部在最近两年内要专为退役军人建造１００多幢拥有６０—８０套住房的大楼。
    这位苏军总参谋长不主张把现行的义务兵役制改成志愿入伍的雇佣兵制，因为后者不符合社会主义国家的建军原则。苏联宪法规定每个公民都有保卫祖国的义务。
    莫伊谢耶夫还表示，苏联国防部所属的军工企业要迅速转向生产民用产品，其产量今年应比去年翻一番。１９９０年要比１９８８年翻两番。１９９０年苏联国防部的部队、机关、企业和组织为居民提供的有偿服务预计可达近五亿卢布。
