The Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces released a dry season combat report. The report stated that from October 1988 to May 1989, the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces killed and wounded 18,153 Vietnamese soldiers, rendering 13,550 Vietnamese soldiers combat ineffective, and captured and destroyed 306 Vietnamese military outposts.

The report said that during this dry season, the invading Vietnamese forces launched multiple sweeps in the interior and western border regions of Cambodia. From April 9 to May 16 alone, the Vietnamese forces conducted four major sweeps against the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces stationed in the Banteay Meanchey province's Bailaing area. In the counter-sweep operations, the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces destroyed 11 enemy tanks and armored vehicles and 15 pieces of heavy weaponry.

The report said that in the battles to attack and disrupt Vietnamese supply lines, the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces destroyed 124 enemy military vehicles, 4 locomotive engines, 40 train carriages, 160 motorboats and wooden boats, and damaged the Phnom Penh to Banteay Meanchey railway in 350 places.

The report said that during this dry season, Vietnam increased its troops in Cambodia by 28,800 and relocated more than 10,000 people. Currently, the Vietnamese forces in Cambodia number over 100,000, with more than 1.25 million relocated people.

The report pointed out that one of the main tasks of the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces during this dry season was to undermine the enemy's rural administration, cut off the enemy's economic and manpower sources, and mobilize the people to disrupt the enemy's large and small water and land transportation lines.

In analyzing the battlefield situation, the report said that the Vietnamese forces were unable to launch a large-scale offensive nationwide, but in the Banteay Meanchey province's Bailaing area, they deployed approximately four divisions of troops to launch an offensive lasting over a month, attempting to retake the outposts captured by the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces, but achieved nothing and suffered heavy losses. Both the invading Vietnamese forces and the Heng Samrin puppet forces are experiencing widespread war weariness, with increasing incidents of desertion and going AWOL.

　　民柬国民军发表旱季战绩公报
    击毙越军１．８万余人　攻克摧毁据点３０６个
    新华社北京５月２８日电  据民主柬埔寨电台今天广播，民主柬埔寨国民军总司令部５月２６日发表１９８８年１０月至１９８９年５月旱季战绩公报说，国民军在这个旱季中打死打伤越军１８１５３人，使１３５５０名越军丧失战斗力，攻克和摧毁越军据点３０６个。
    公报说，在这个旱季中，侵柬越军在柬埔寨内地和西部边界地区多次发动扫荡。仅在今年４月９日到５月１６日期间，越军向驻扎在马德望省拜林地区的国民军发动了４次大扫荡。国民军在反扫荡中击毁敌军坦克和装甲车１１辆、重型武器１５件。
    公报说，在袭击和破坏越军运输线的战斗中，国民军击毁敌军军车１２４辆、火车头４辆、车厢４０节、汽艇和木船１６０艘，破坏金边至马德望的铁路３５０处。
    公报说，在这个旱季中，越南又向柬埔寨增兵２８８００人，移民１万多人。目前，越军在柬埔寨的总兵力达１０万多人，移民达１２５万人。
    公报指出，民柬国民军在这个旱季的工作重点之一是瓦解敌人的乡村政权，断绝敌人的经济来源和兵源，动员人民破坏敌人的大大小小的水陆交通运输线。
    公报在分析战场形势时说，越军未能在全国发动大规模攻势，只是在马德望省拜林地区出动了约４个师的兵力发动长达一个多月的攻势，企图夺回被国民军攻占的据点，但一无所获，反而损失惨重。无论是侵柬越军还是韩桑林伪军，厌战情绪蔓延，倒戈和开小差事件日增。
