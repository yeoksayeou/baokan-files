Xinhua News Agency, Xining, May 4th.

The state has decided to begin reconstructing the Qinghai-Tibet Railway starting this June. This year, an investment of 30 million yuan will be made, primarily to address severe bottlenecks such as the Guanjiao Tunnel.

The Qinghai-Tibet Railway is currently experiencing serious issues: frost damage threatens a large portion of the tracks, the Guanjiao Tunnel is at risk of collapse at any moment, sandstorms have caused multiple train accidents, the swampy foundations continue to sink, and the salt lake foundations have seen a significant increase in cavities.

It is reported that the entire reconstruction project is expected to be completed in three years. After the reconstruction, the railway's capacity will increase from the current 130,000 tons to 250,000 tons.

　　青藏铁路六月开始改造
    新华社西宁５月４日电  （记者孙宁海、王运才）国家已决定从今年６月开始对青藏铁路进行改造。今年将投资３０００万元，首先整治关角隧道等严重梗阻的路段。
    青藏铁路出现严重的铁路病害：冻害危及大部分线路，咽喉地段关角隧道随时有坍塌危险，沙害造成多起行车事故，沼泽路基不断下沉，盐湖路基溶洞剧增等。
    据介绍，全部改造工程预计３年完成，改造后的运力将可由现在的１３０万吨增加到２５０万吨。
