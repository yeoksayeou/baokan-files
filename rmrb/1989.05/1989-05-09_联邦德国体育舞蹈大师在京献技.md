Sports dance masters from the Brunswick Sports Dance Club of the Federal Republic of Germany performed in Beijing on May 8th and 9th, presenting a spectacular show at the Capital Gymnasium. The performance not only provided artistic enjoyment but also deepened the audience's understanding of this sport, which will be a demonstration event at the 1992 Olympics.

Originating in Europe and Latin America, sports dance combines artistic elements with competitive sports, integrating costumes, music, posture, and dance. It has gained popularity worldwide. Currently, world championships, world cups, and various invitational tournaments are held annually. The World Championships alone have been held 40 times. Founded in 1962, the Brunswick Sports Dance Club has been a multiple-time champion in major international competitions. The club is particularly renowned for its innovative group dance choreography, beautiful music, and seamless coordination.

It is worth noting that China also has a similar amateur organization, the Aisi International Standard Dance Club, which has reached a high level of proficiency.

This performance was jointly organized by the China International Sports and Tourism Company and other units.

　　联邦德国体育舞蹈大师在京献技
    本报北京５月９日讯  记者吴骅报道：应邀来访的联邦德国不伦瑞克体育舞蹈俱乐部，５月８日和９日晚在首都体育馆向观众献上了一台精彩的体育舞蹈节目。它不仅给人以艺术的享受，也增进了人们对这个１９９２年奥运会表演项目的了解。
    起源于欧洲和拉丁美洲的体育舞蹈，兼有艺术的内涵，又有体育竞赛的形式，融服装、音乐、体态、舞蹈为一体，受到世界各国人民的喜爱。目前，体育舞蹈的世界锦标赛、世界杯赛和各类邀请赛每年都举行，仅世界锦标赛已举行过４０届。创建于１９６２年的不伦瑞克体育舞蹈俱乐部，是多次世界大赛的冠军获得者。该俱乐部尤以集体舞编排新颖、音乐优美、配合默契著称。
    据悉，目前我国也有一个类似的民办团体——爱士国际标准舞俱乐部，这个由业余爱好者组成的体育舞蹈俱乐部也已达到相当的水准。
    这次演出是由中国国际体育旅游公司等单位联合主办的。
