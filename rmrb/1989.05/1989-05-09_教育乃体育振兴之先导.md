The decline in China's strong sports disciplines has caused a strong reaction throughout society. The current decline in Chinese sports is fundamentally a reflection of the insufficient development of education over the past decade of reform.

It is well known that sports are composed of school sports, mass sports, and competitive sports. School sports are the largest pillar of sports, and the foundation of competitive sports lies in school sports. School sports, however, are rooted in the soil of education. Without a developed school education, there can be no high-level school sports. The shrinkage and imbalance of education will directly affect the development of sports. The current crisis of a lack of talented individuals in strong sports disciplines and the impending cutoff is a result of educational failures.

Looking at China's current sports system, sports and education are disconnected, and sports do not prioritize education. Many of our world champions and Olympic medalists have only a primary school education; while those who have won numerous exams and entered prestigious universities are often pale-faced and physically weak. Almost all athletes participating in major international and domestic sports competitions come from provincial, municipal, and autonomous region sports teams. In contrast, in sports-developed countries like Europe and America, many Olympic athletes come from universities. For many years, our sports, especially competitive sports, have been severely guided by the idea of seeking quick results. This has ignored the objective laws of human growth and development, and underestimated the functions and roles of education. In various provinces and cities, a large number of young students are gathered for intensive training. They focus on strengthening sports training, while cultural studies are left for after they retire from sports. For these young athletes, more opportunities should be given for them to receive cultural education.

### 教育乃体育振兴之先导

　　教育乃体育振兴之先导
    我国体育优势项目发生滑坡，在整个社会引起强烈震动。当今中国体育的滑坡正是这十年来改革中发展教育不足的根本反应。
    众所周知，体育是由学校体育、大众体育和竞技体育所构成。而学校体育是体育的最大支柱，竞技体育的基础是学校体育。学校体育却植根于教育的土壤里，没有发达的学校教育就没有高水平的学校体育。教育萎缩，教育的倾斜，必然直接影响体育的发展。现今体育优势项目出现人材青黄不接，面临断档的危机正是教育的故障所致。
    纵观我国现行的体育体制，体育与教育脱节，体育不重视教育，我国众多获得世界冠军，领取奥运会奖牌的选手仅仅具有小学文化；而那些在无数次考试中的获胜者，闯入高等学府的一代精英，却多半是苍白的面孔和衰弱的身体；凡是参加国际国内的重大体育比赛都青一色出自省、市、自治区运动队的运动员担任。而在欧美体育发达的国家里，参加奥运会的选手中，许多都出自大学。多年来，我们的体育，特别是竞技体育严重地存在急功近利的指导思想。忽略了人的成长发展的客观规律，轻视了教育之功能和作用。在我国各省、市聚集了一大批集训的青少年学生，他们看重追求的是强化运动训练，而文化学习则是在他们退出体坛后的事。对于这些少年运动员，要更多地给他们受文化教育的机会。
