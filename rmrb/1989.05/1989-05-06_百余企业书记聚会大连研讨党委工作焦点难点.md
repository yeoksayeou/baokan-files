More than 100 secretaries from large and medium-sized enterprises gathered in Dalian at the end of April to discuss the key and difficult issues in Party committee work. The meeting was initiated by "Party Building Digest" and co-hosted by seven publications, including the Political and Legal Affairs Department and the Economic Department of the People's Daily, "Half-Monthly Talks," "Chinese Political System Reform," "Theoretical Dynamics" from the Central Party School, "Party School Forum," and "Theoretical Information Daily."

The participants, who came from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Liaoning, and other regions, shared their experiences and insights on implementing the separation of party and government functions and the "Enterprise Law" since the Third Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee.

The secretaries expressed a common sentiment and resolve: "In the new era, enterprise Party organizations face numerous difficulties and challenges. However, we must consider the bigger picture, stay spirited, and confidently carry out the Party's various tasks, fulfilling our duties and responsibilities to complete the Party's various missions."
