The vice-director of the Xi Feng County Power Supply Bureau, Yu Guoping, abused his authority and intentionally caused a power outage, severely disrupting the work and life of county offices and residents. The impact was extremely negative. The Party Committee and Management Meeting of the Guiyang Power Supply Bureau decided to give Yu Guoping a one-year probationary period within the Party and to remove him from his position as vice-director of the Power Supply Bureau.

On February 27th at around 5:50 PM, the Xi Feng County Public Security Bureau's traffic police corrected a traffic violation by a vehicle from the Xi Feng County Power Supply Bureau and confiscated the driver's license. At around 6:30 PM, Yu Guoping went to the county government and demanded that the main responsible person of the county government intervene with the traffic police to return the confiscated driver's license. The county government official agreed to look into the matter. Yu was dissatisfied with this response and left. Approximately 20 minutes later, Yu Guoping personally led four employees from the Power Supply Bureau, driving a large truck and a small car, to the traffic police station. He ordered the employees to cut the lighting wires of the traffic police station and said this was a small retaliation against the traffic police. Immediately after, he led the group to cause a near-citywide power outage.

Due to this sudden power outage, the normal work order, living order, and teaching and research order of the entire county were severely disrupted: Party, government, and military offices lost command, the radio station stopped broadcasting, the airport navigation station could not navigate, stores closed early, enterprises stopped production, and students' evening self-study was affected.

This power outage lasted 47 hours and was only restored after the intervention of higher-level leaders.

　　泄私愤故意断电　两昼夜损失严重    
    息烽“电霸”余国平被撤职
    本报贵阳５月２日电  记者潘帝都报道：贵州省息烽县供电所副主任余国平滥用职权，蓄意制造停电事故，严重妨碍县城机关、居民的工作和生活，影响十分恶劣。贵阳市供电局党委和局务会决定，给予余国平留党察看一年和撤销供电所副主任职务的处分。
    今年２月２７日下午５时５０分左右，息烽县公安局交通警察纠正息烽县供电所汽车违章行驶，当场收扣驾驶员驾驶执照。下午６时３０分左右，余国平就来到县政府，找到县政府主要负责人，以命令口气要县政府负责人向交警队打招呼，送回被扣的驾驶执照。县政府负责人答应过问一下。余对此答复不满，随即离去。大约过了２０分钟左右，余国平便亲自带领供电所４名职工，开着一部大车和一部小车来到交警队门口。余国平命令职工把交警队的照明电线剪断，并说这是给交警队一次小小的报复。紧接着，他又带人造成几乎全城停电事件。
    由于这次突然的停电，使整个县城正常的工作秩序、生活秩序和教学、科研秩序受到严重干扰：党政军机关因停电而指挥失灵，广播站停止广播，飞机导航站无法进行导航，商店普遍提前关门，企业停产，学生晚自习也受影响。
    这次停电长达４７个小时，后在上级领导的干预下才恢复通电。
