Vitamins C and E Can Prevent Cataracts

A study from the University of Western Ontario in Canada has shown that supplementing with vitamins C and E can help prevent cataracts.

According to "Science News," this finding confirms previous similar research in the United States: supplementing with vitamin E can prevent cataracts.

Experiments conducted on animals by the researchers showed that diabetic mice fed a diet high in vitamin E had less leakage of lens proteins. Experiments on guinea pigs also confirmed that vitamin C can increase the ascorbic acid content in the eyes, helping to prevent the formation of cataracts.

The researchers compared the various conditions of 175 cataract patients over the age of 55 with those of 175 people of the same age and sex who did not have cataracts. They found that those who did not have cataracts had been taking at least 400 international units of vitamin E or 300 milligrams of vitamin C per person per day for at least five years.

　　维生素Ｃ和Ｅ可防白内障
    新华社华盛顿５月２２日电  加拿大西安大略大学的一项研究表明，补充维生素Ｃ和维生素Ｅ有助于防止患白内障。
    据《科学新闻》报道，这一发现确认了美国以前类似的研究结果：补充维生素Ｅ可预防白内障。
    研究人员对动物进行的实验表明，患糖尿病的老鼠被喂食高含量维生素Ｅ食物后，晶状体蛋白质的漏出较少，用豚鼠进行的试验也已证实，维生素Ｃ可增加眼睛中的抗坏血酸含量，有助于阻止白内障的形成。
    研究人员将１７５名年龄在５５岁以上的白内障病人的各方面情况与１７５名无白内障、年龄、性别相同的人进行了比较，发现未患白内障的人至少５年来每人每天摄入４００国际单位维生素Ｅ或３００毫升维生素Ｃ。
