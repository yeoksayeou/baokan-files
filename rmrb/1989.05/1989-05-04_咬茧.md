The eighth session of the Seventh National People's Congress passed nine bills, but none of them were passed unanimously. The bill authorizing Shenzhen City to formulate economic regulations and rules for the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone had 274 votes against and 805 abstentions, totaling more than 60% of the votes in favor. Is this normal or abnormal? Is it a cause for joy or concern?

Three years ago, during the fourth session of the Sixth National People's Congress, a few representatives voted against the candidates for vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee due to their advanced age. The news spread, and people discussed it extensively. The few representatives who voted against became the focus of attention. However, this time, after the voting results were announced, everything was calm, and almost everyone considered it a natural outcome. The development of events and the change in people's minds have indeed been rapid!

The fundamental principle of democratic centralism is that the majority decides, or in other words, the minority submits to the majority. This principle itself fully demonstrates that when a bill is put to a vote, whether to support, oppose, or abstain, is an inalienable right of the representatives. The voting results, whether unanimously passed, passed by a majority, or not passed, are all normal phenomena. The fundamental interests of the Chinese people are the same, but specific interests still differ, and understanding even more so. Therefore, having different or even opposite attitudes towards the same issue is inevitable and unavoidable, and there is nothing strange about it. There was once a view that 3000:0 is much better than 51:49, much more democratic. This one-sided and absolute statement is not conducive to the construction of socialist democratic politics and also goes against historical practice.

The Communist Party and the leadership are composed of people with the same beliefs and programs, but in the history of the Chinese Communist Party, when deciding important issues, serious disagreements are not uncommon. The famous Zunyi Conference, with only one vote, defeated the leftist line of Wang Ming, which is a well-known fact. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on the issue of signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Lenin's proposal was once in the minority, and it was only after patient persuasion and the lessons of facts, through several votes, that it was finally passed by a narrow majority. If the Communist Party decides issues in this way, then in the National People's Congress, such a state power organ, the appearance of majority and minority when deciding issues is even less surprising. The essence of democratic centralism is not in the proportion of votes for and against at the time of voting, but in the representatives completely deciding their attitudes according to their own will, and once the majority decides, the minority respects and obeys.

Since liberation, there has indeed been a situation where the National People's Congress, when making decisions, all unanimously passes resolutions. This has also formed a concept: unanimity is normal, and non-unanimity is abnormal. It should be said that this situation and concept itself are actually abnormal. The reasons are relatively complex, but generally, there are two main types: either out of a blind trust concept, believing that everything submitted for discussion must be correct; or out of a fear psychology, worrying that expressing dissent will bring some adverse consequences. Behind these mentalities, the deep-seated reason is the lack of democratic atmosphere and the insufficient political participation consciousness and ability of the representatives. Lu Xun said well in his essay "On Seeing with Open Eyes": "One must dare to face reality, only then can one dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to take responsibility." Avoiding contradictions and adopting an ostrich policy towards democracy is not acceptable.

In summary, it is not necessary for everything to be unanimous, which is not a necessary manifestation of socialism democracy, but rather a distortion and misfortune of socialism democracy.

This session of the National People's Congress, the representatives' criticisms, inquiries, and suggestions on the government's work were enthusiastic and to the point. During the voting, they could all vote according to their own will, showing the improvement of the people's representatives' democratic concepts, political participation consciousness, and political deliberation ability, and showing the high level of democratic atmosphere in the meeting.

Self-entanglement. In fact, the silkworm's cocoon is entirely for creating a safe environment for its own transformation. Once it transforms into a moth, it uses its mouth to bite through the cocoon, emerge, lay eggs, and reproduce offspring. It is not stupid. It is we who are often constrained by bad traditional habits and outdated concepts, making it difficult to move, and for a long time, we are not self-aware, even regarding our own set as the best, criticizing those different from us as heresy. Self-erecting a Buddha and worshipping it is truly a bit stupid. The blind worship and superstition of unanimity or so-called 3000:0 is an example. But since people want to progress and develop, they will eventually grow a mouth like a moth, and the cocoon will be bitten through sooner or later. If the few representatives' votes of dissent three years ago represented an attempt to bite through the cocoon, then the voting situation of this session of the National People's Congress shows that the cocoon has finally been bitten through. This is indeed a cause for joy and celebration.

　　咬茧

    七届人大二次会议，通过了九件议案，却没有一件是一致通过的。关于授权深圳市制定深圳特区经济法规和规章的议案，表决结果竟有２７４票反对，８０５票弃权，两者相加，相当于赞成票的６０％以上。事属正常，还是不正常？可喜乎，抑可忧乎？
    记得三年以前，六届人大四次会议补选人大常委副委员长时，有几位代表因候选人年事过高而投了反对票。消息传出，人们议论纷纷，投反对票的几位代表一时也成了众所瞩目的新闻人物。而这一次投票结果公布以后，却风平浪静，几乎人人视为题中应有之义。事情的发展，人们观念的变化，也真叫快！
    民主制或民主集中制的根本原则，是多数决定，或者叫少数服从多数。这一原则的本身，就充分表明在议案付诸表决时，或赞成，或反对，或弃权，乃是代表们不可剥夺的权利。表决结果，或一致通过，或以多数通过，或未能通过，都属正常现象。我国人民的根本利益是一致的，但具体利益仍有差异，认识更有区别，因而对同一问题有不同的甚至相反的态度，也就是势所必致，事所难免，毫不足怪。曾经有过一种论点，以为３０００∶０比５１∶４９要好得多，民主得多，这种片面而绝对的说法，并不利于社会主义民主政治的建设，也有背于历史的实践。
    共产党及领导机关，是由有着共同信仰和纲领的人们所组成，但在中国党的历史上决定重要问题时，出现严重不一致，并不罕见。有名的遵义会议，仅仅以一票之差击败了王明左倾路线，这是尽人皆知的事实。苏联共产党在签订布列斯特和约问题上，列宁的主张曾处于少数，只是在耐心的说服和事实的教训下，经过几次投票，才最终以微弱的多数得到通过。共产党党内决定问题尚且如此，在人民代表大会这样的国家权力机关内决定问题时，出现多数和少数，那就更不足怪了。民主制的精髓不在于表决时赞成和不赞成票数的比例，而在于代表们完全根据自己的意志决定自己的态度，而一经多数决定，少数即加以尊重和服从。
    解放以来，确实存在一种情况：人大开会凡有决议，全属一致通过。由此又形成一种观念：以一致为正常，以不一致为不正常。应该说这种情况和观念的本身，其实恰恰是一种不正常。究其原因，比较复杂，但大致不外乎两种：或者出于一种盲目信任观念，以为凡提交讨论的东西必然正确；或者出于一种恐惧心理，担心表示了异议会带来什么恶果。而在这种种心态背后的深层原因，则是缺乏民主空气和代表的参政意识和能力不足。鲁迅在《论睁了眼看》一文中讲得好：“必须敢于正视，这才可望敢想，敢说，敢作，敢当。”回避矛盾，对民主搞鸵鸟政策是不行的。
    总之，事必一致决非社会主义民主的必然体现，相反倒是社会主义民主的扭曲和不幸。
    这次人大会议，代表们对政府工作的批评、质询和建议，热烈中肯，表决时又能各各根据自己的意志投票，显示了人民代表民主观念、参政意识和议政能力的提高，显示了会议民主空气的高扬。
    作茧自缚。其实，蚕的做茧，全在于为自己的蜕变创造一个安全的环境，一旦蜕化成蛾，便用自己的嘴把茧咬破，出而产卵，繁衍后代，它并不笨。倒是我们自己常常被不良的传统习惯和陈旧观念束缚得难于动弹，又久久不能自觉，甚至以自己的那一套为至善至美，指斥异于己者为左道旁门。自立菩萨自拜佛，这是真正有点蠢笨的。对于一致或所谓３０００∶０的盲目崇拜和迷信，就是一个例子。但人们既然要前进发展，总会长出像蛾一样的嘴来，那茧或迟或早总要被咬破。如果说三年前那几位代表的反对票，表示了一种咬茧的尝试，那么这次人代会表决的情况，就说明那茧已终于被咬破，这实在是可喜可贺的。
