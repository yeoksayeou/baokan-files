A classical dance that had been lost for over forty years, known as Yin-Yang Ban, has recently been revived. This dance, also known as Da Yin-Yang, originated during the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty. It was created by the local people as a form of entertainment to celebrate a bountiful harvest and to wish for good fortune. After liberation, this popular folk art was temporarily lost due to various reasons.
