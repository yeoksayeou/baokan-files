Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, May 3rd.

On the issue of establishing an interim government, the two major Afghan alliances have reached an initial agreement.

According to the Islamic Republic News Agency of Iran, the representatives of the eight-party alliance based in Iran and the seven-party alliance based in Pakistan held direct talks in Tehran and reached this agreement.

After further consultations on the agreement, the eight-party alliance is prepared to send a delegation to Pakistan to sign the final document. However, the report did not disclose the specific composition of the interim government or how the positions in the interim government would be allocated.

In February of this year, the seven-party alliance established an interim government. It had promised to allocate seven positions to the eight-party alliance, but later only gave four minor positions. The eight-party alliance believes that the important positions in the cabinet should be held alternately by both sides.

　　就建立临时政府问题   
    阿两大联盟达成协议
    新华社德黑兰５月３日电  据伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社报道，阿富汗游击队的两大联盟今天就建立临时政府初步达成协议。
    这项协议是总部设在伊朗的８党联盟和总部设在巴基斯坦的７党联盟代表团在德黑兰举行直接会谈后达成的。
    在就协议进行进一步磋商之后，八党联盟准备派出一个代表团到巴基斯坦签署最后文件。但报道没有透露临时政府具体组成情况以及如何分配临时政府席位。
    ７党联盟今年２月曾建立了一个临时政府。它曾许诺分配给８党联盟７个席位，可后来只给了４个次要席位。８党联盟认为内阁的重要席位应由双方轮流担任。
