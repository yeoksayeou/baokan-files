According to the Japan External Trade Organization's food import statistics released in April this year, Japan's imports of agricultural and livestock products in 1988 amounted to $30.928 billion, an increase of 31% over 1987. Japan's agricultural and livestock product imports in 1988 had two notable features: rising average prices and product upgrading. Additionally, the number of countries exporting agricultural and livestock products to Japan increased.

Looking at the imported varieties, shrimp, corn, pork, beef, grains, and other meats have been in the top six for three consecutive years.

In the meat category, the import value of high-quality beef, chicken, and pork increased simultaneously. The import of fresh and chilled vegetables such as onions and seaweed also saw a significant increase. The import of fish and shellfish, as well as fruits, also increased significantly. In 1988, the quantity of food imports into Japan increased by only 11.6%, but the import value far exceeded the import quantity, indicating that the import of agricultural and livestock products is moving towards higher quality and more premium products. It can also be said that there is a shift towards pursuing "freshness" and high added value.

The countries that export the most agricultural and livestock products to Japan are the United States, the European Community, China, and Canada.

Japan's imports of agricultural and livestock products are shifting from low-priced raw material-type agricultural products represented by wheat, corn, and soybeans to fresh products such as meat and fruits, semi-finished and finished products such as meat products and grain products. The proportion of high-priced, high-added-value products in imported agricultural and livestock products is relatively high.

　　日本进口农牧产品新动向
    刘迪
    据日本贸易振兴会今年４月公布的食品进口统计，１９８８年日本农牧产品进口额为３０９．２８亿美元，比１９８７年增长３１％。去年日本农牧产品进口有两个显著特点，即平均单价上升和产品高级化。此外，向日本输出农牧产品的国家增多。
    从进口品种来看，虾、玉米、猪肉、牛肉、谷物和其他肉类连续３年居前６位。
    在肉类中，优质牛肉、鸡肉和猪肉的进口额同步增长，葱头、龙须菜等新鲜和冷藏蔬菜的进口也大幅度增长。鱼贝类、水果类也显著增长。去年，日本食品进口数量仅增长１１．６％，但进口金额则大大超过进口数量，这说明农牧产品进口正向优质、高级的方向发展。也可以说正向追求“鲜度”与高附加值的方向转变。
    对日本出口农牧产品最多的国家，是美国、欧共体、中国和加拿大等。
    日本进口的农牧产品正由以小麦、玉米、大豆为代表的进口单价较低的原料型农产品向肉类、水果等新鲜产品、肉类制品、谷物制品等半成品和成品转变。单价和附加值较高的产品在进口农牧产品中所占的比例较高。
