The White House is located to the right of the new overpass in the western part of the city.

It is an old-style wooden house with distinct national characteristics. Originally, it was owned by a former official named Bai. After liberation, it was managed by the Bureau of Retired Cadres. Now, the owner is an old general whom I am familiar with, who once served as the political commissar of a border defense military region.

It has been a long time since I last saw the old general. I walked into the White House, and the general was on the phone, with three local officials sitting beside him. They all looked very serious. I didn't know what had happened.

"Uh... yes, yes! Report it to the Party Committee like that!"

The old general spoke firmly into the phone, just like when he used to issue combat orders. It seemed like he only hung up after making sure the other person had heard clearly.

The three local officials also seemed to have completed an important task, exchanged glances, and all sighed in relief, ready to leave.

The old general tried to keep them, and introduced me to them. However, the three local officials still left.

The living room was left with only the old general and me. He asked about various aspects of my life and showed concern, and I respectfully answered him one by one. But from the old general's enthusiastic words, I still felt that he was talking to me with heavy burdens on his mind. What had happened?

Driven by my professional instincts and because he was an old commander, I couldn't help but ask the old general. He gestured for me to sit on the sofa first, then lit a cigarette, took a few puffs, and said with some regret, "It's not anyone else's fault, it's all my mistake, I was careless!"

He seemed like he had lost a small hill in battle.

The old general's wife passed away two years ago, leaving a daughter and a son. The daughter works abroad. The son used to work in the management department of a steel company, but was found to have speculated on several batches of steel, becoming a "speculator." When the son did this business, he used the old general's name, but the old general did not know about it. However, when the inspection agency initially investigated this matter, he, in order to protect his son, "admitted" to the matter. Later, he thought, "That's not right!" This time, when the inspection agency came again, he told the truth, and that's when the previous scene happened.

After the old general finished speaking, he fell into deep pain.

I was also speechless. What could I say?

The old-style clock in the living room was ticking.

About ten minutes later, I stood up to leave and advised him that the matter had passed, hoping he would take care of his health. The old general nodded in thanks and said, "This is a defeat!"

"But it's also a victory," I said to him.

"But it was a defeat first," the old general said, "It seems that an old soldier off the battlefield wants to win again, he must first win a battle in his own mind. If he can't defeat himself, even a great general on the battlefield will lose miserably!"

My heart was shaken. After bidding farewell to the old general, I lingered for a long time by the illuminated overpass. Looking down at the distant White House, I saw a sturdy black figure pacing around his small courtyard, one circle, then another...

I knew who that black figure was.

Was he looking for a new breakthrough in battle?

I believed he was.

But it was a battle against himself!

I will never forget that small White House.

　　白楼
    杨景民
    白楼在城西新立交桥的右下边。
    那是一座富有民族特色的旧式木楼。原先住的是一个姓白的旧官僚，解放后归老干部局，现在的主人是我熟悉的一位曾任边防军区政治委员的老将军。
    好长时间没见老将军了。我走进白楼，将军正在接电话，旁边坐着三个地方干部模样的人，他们神情都很严峻。不知发生了什么事情。
    “唔……嗯唔，对对！就这么向党委报告吧！”
    老将军对着话筒，果断地讲，像当年下作战命令一样。好像等到对方确切听清楚了后，他才放下了电话。
    三个地方干部也似了却一桩重要心事一样，对视一下，都长长出了一口气，立即便有了要起身的意思。
    老将军挽留他们，并把我介绍给他们。那三个地方干部还是告辞了。
    客厅里就剩下了老将军和我，对我各方面的询问、关心是少不了的，我也恭敬地向将军一一作答。但我从老将军热情话语中，还是感到他是带着重重心事和我谈话的。究竟发生了什么事情？  　出于我的工作本能，也由于他是老首长，我忍不住问了老将军。他示意我先坐到沙发上，然后燃起一支香烟，抽了几口，颇有些失悔地说道：“不关别人什么事，都怪我，走了神！”
    他像作战时丢失了一座小高地一样。
    老将军的老伴前年故去，膝下一女一男。女儿在国外工作。儿子原先在一家钢铁公司经理部任职，因被查出来套购了几批钢材，成了“官倒”。儿子在作这笔生意时，是用了他的名义的，他原本不知道。可在检察单位初查此事时，他为了保儿子，竟“承认”有此事。后来一想，不对呀！这回，检察单位干部又来时，他如实说了，就发生了刚才那幕场景。
    老将军说完，陷入了深深的痛苦中。
    我也无言。我又能说些什么呢？
    客厅的老式摆钟在响着脚步声。
    约十分钟后，我起身告辞，并劝说那事情已经过去，望他珍重身体。老将军点头作谢，又说：“这是一个败仗呵！”
    又是一个胜仗。我对他说，
    “但毕竟先打了败仗”，老将军说，“看来，老兵下了火线，要再打胜仗，也得先在自己头脑里打一胜仗，战胜不了自己，名将上战场也会输个一塌糊涂呵！”
    我的心灵受到震动。在告别老将军后，我在灯火立交桥边久久徘徊。下望远处那座白楼时，见一个健壮的黑影，在围着他的白楼小院转着，一圈，又一圈……
    我知道那黑影是谁。
    他会是在寻找新的战斗的突破口？
    我相信会的。
    可那是对着自己呵！
    我忘不了那座小白楼。
