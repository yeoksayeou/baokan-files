Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, May 5th.

The second round of negotiations on European conventional arms and the establishment of confidence and security measures began today at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. Representatives from both the East and West expressed optimism about the new round of talks, but still held differing views on the types of weapons that should be discussed.

At a press conference held this afternoon, representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, and other countries all stated that there was consensus on the establishment of working groups to advance the negotiation process. Informal negotiations on this issue will be conducted within the next week.

The Warsaw Pact side proposed dividing the negotiation area into several geographical regions, such as the so-called "contact zone" and "rear zone." The proposal requires simultaneous reductions in troops and weapon systems in all regions and sets a maximum limit on military strength and weapons in each region to prevent the reinforcement of troops and weapons from the rear to the frontline in emergency situations. The U.S. representative welcomed this proposal from the Warsaw Pact but criticized it for not specifying the exact numbers for the limits.

Regarding the types of weapons to be negotiated, the two sides still have differing opinions. Oleg Grinevsky, head of the Soviet delegation, reiterated at the press conference that in addition to negotiating tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles proposed by NATO, the reduction of troops, fighter jets, and helicopters should also be included in the negotiations. He particularly emphasized the importance of significantly reducing the number of troops.

Steven Ledogar, head of the U.S. delegation, expressed disappointment that the Warsaw Pact side raised the issue of tactical nuclear weapons and naval and air forces at the start of the second round of talks. He accused the Warsaw Pact of attempting to exploit internal NATO disputes over short-range missiles.

　　欧洲常规军备第二轮谈判开始    
    东西方代表对需要谈判的武器种类各持己见
    新华社维也纳５月５日电  欧洲常规军备谈判和建立信任及安全措施谈判第二轮会谈今天在维也纳霍夫堡宫开始。东西方代表对新一轮谈判都表示乐观，但在需要谈判的武器种类问题上仍然各持己见。
    在今天中午举行的记者招待会上，苏、美等国代表都表示，东西方在建立工作小组以推动谈判进程的问题上意见一致，下周内将就这一问题进行非正式谈判。
    华约方面建议把谈判区域分成若干地理区，如分成所谓“接触区”和“后方区”等。建议要求在所有区域内同时裁减军队和武器系统，而且规定每个区域内的军力和武器最高限额，以防止在紧急情况下从后方向前沿地区增援部队和武器。美国代表对华约的这一建议表示欢迎，但批评这一建议没有提到限额的具体数字。
    关于要谈判的武器种类，双方意见仍然相左。苏联代表团团长奥列格·格里涅夫斯基在记者招待会上重申，除了谈判北约方面提出的坦克、火炮和装甲车以外，还应将裁减军队、战斗机和直升机等纳入谈判范围。他特别强调了大幅度裁减军队人数的重要性。
    美国代表团团长史蒂文·莱多加尔对华约方面在第二轮会谈开始时重提战术核武器和海空军问题表示失望，他指责华约企图利用北约内部关于短导问题的争论。
