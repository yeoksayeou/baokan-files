At the invitation of the Ministry of Culture, the Second Troupe of the Jiangsu Peking Opera Company is performing in Beijing. After decades of absence, "Red Lotus Fragrance" will once again grace the stage of the capital tonight. Renowned Peking Opera actress Huang Xiaoci will also perform traditional excerpts such as "The Jade Bracelet," "The Jade Hall Spring," and "The White Gate Tower."

At the beginning of the 20th century, the renowned Jiangnan actress Feng Zihe first presented "Red Lotus Fragrance," which became immensely popular and a representative work of the Hai Pai style. Unfortunately, it was later lost and did not appear on stage for decades. After extensive efforts, the Jiangsu Peking Opera Second Troupe has revived "Red Lotus Fragrance" in a new form. The play tells the story of the son of a Ming Dynasty Minister of War who, while fleeing, falls in love with a local girl named Wu Lingjie. With its fresh and natural style, reminiscent of small bridges and flowing water, the play has won the hearts of the audience and received an award at the 1988 National Peking Opera New Works Festival.

Huang Xiaoci is highly regarded in the south. With her elegant appearance, sweet voice, and versatile acting range, she has brought to life a vivid image of a Chinese rural girl in "Red Lotus Fragrance," earning her the Outstanding Performance Award at the 1988 National Excellent New Works Festival.

　　《红菱艳》绝响数十载后再现舞台
    本报北京５月１日讯  应文化部邀请，江苏省京剧院二团进京作专场演出。《红菱艳》绝响数十载后于今晚再现首都舞台。京剧名旦黄孝慈还将演出传统折子戏《拾玉镯》、《玉堂春》和《白门楼》。
    位列江南名旦首位的冯子和本世纪初首先推出《红菱艳》，风靡一时，成为海派杰出代表作。后不幸失传，辍演舞台数十载。江苏京剧二团经过大量工作，使《红菱艳》以新的面目重现。该剧表现的是明朝兵部尚书的公子逃难之中与江南采菱姑娘邬菱姐的爱情故事，以其清新自然、小桥流水式的风格赢得了观众，并在１９８８年全国京剧新剧目汇演中获奖。
    黄孝慈在南方颇有声望。她扮相俊美，嗓音甜润，戏路宽广，在《红菱艳》剧中，她以精湛的表演，塑造了一个活灵活现的中国农村少女形象，获１９８８年全国优秀新剧目汇演优秀表演奖。
