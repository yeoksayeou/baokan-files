Benazir Bhutto Discusses the Afghan Refugee Issue
Calls for the Establishment of an Afghan Government Acceptable to All Parties

Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto today stated that to resolve the Afghan refugee problem, conditions must be created that allow Afghan refugees to voluntarily return home.

Bhutto told a magazine that the most important condition is the establishment of an Afghan government acceptable to all parties.

Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, over 3 million Afghans have fled their homes to seek refuge in Pakistan.

Bhutto said that there are three main reasons for the Afghan refugee problem. First, these refugees were forced to leave their homes due to the hardships within the country, and they hold the Kabul regime responsible for this. Second, the fighting between the Afghan Mujahideen and the government forces is still ongoing, and these refugees are unwilling to return under these circumstances. Third, over the past nine years, the Soviet forces and the Kabul government army have planted numerous landmines in Afghanistan's rural areas, posing a serious threat to the safe return of Afghan refugees to their homes and seriously hindering efforts to rebuild Afghanistan in the future.

### 贝·布托谈阿难民问题  要求建立各方都能接受的阿富汗政府

　　贝·布托谈阿难民问题    
    要求建立各方都能接受的阿富汗政府
    新华社伊斯兰堡５月３日电  巴基斯坦总理贝·布托今天认为，若要解决阿富汗难民问题，就必须创造能使阿富汗难民自愿回国的条件。
    布托总理对一家杂志说，最主要的条件是在阿富汗建立一个各方都能接受的政府。
    自１９７９年苏军入侵阿富汗以来，有３００多万名阿富汗人逃离家园，前往巴基斯坦避难。
    布托说，造成阿富汗难民问题的原因主要有３个。第一，这些难民是因国内生活艰难而被迫背井离乡的，他们认为喀布尔政权对此负有责任。第二，由于阿富汗游击队同政府军的战斗目前仍在继续，这些难民不愿在此局势下回国。第三，苏军和喀布尔政府军在过去９年内在阿富汗农村地区埋下了许多地雷，这对阿富汗难民安全返回家园构成了严重危险，也对将来重建阿富汗的努力造成了严重障碍。
