Over the past few months, there have been multiple incidents of farmers arbitrarily stopping vehicles and collecting illegal fees on the road from Xinfeng County in Jiangxi to Nanxiong County in Guangdong. I have personally witnessed several such incidents:

On April 5, I saw villagers from the Chigang Village, Longkeng Subgroup in Zhengping Township repairing several potholes on the public road. A farmer in his thirties, carrying a leather bag, was collecting fees from passing vehicles, charging between five and ten yuan per vehicle. On April 14, I saw villagers from the same village stopping vehicles again, charging ten yuan per vehicle to pass. On April 13, I witnessed villagers from the Gonghe Village Subgroup in Zhengping Township also stopping vehicles and collecting fees, charging ten yuan per vehicle to pass through. A few drivers who refused to pay were surrounded by the villagers, who threatened to smash their vehicles. These drivers had no choice but to pay the toll.

I urge the relevant authorities to take measures to stop this practice.

    随意拦车乱收费用坑苦司机
    近几个月来，在江西信丰县至广东南雄县公路上，多次发生农民拦车乱收费的情况。我曾目睹了几次：
    四月五日，我看见正平乡赤岗村长坑里小组每家出一人，修了公路上几个坑洞。一个三十多岁的农民手提牛皮袋子，向过往汽车司机收费，每辆车征收五至十元。四月十四日，我又看到这个村的农民在拦车收费，每辆车交十元才放行。四月十三日，我见正平乡共和村小组农民也在拦车收费，每辆车过往那里要交十元买路钱，有几个司机不愿出钱，农民就一拥而上，扬言要砸车。这几个司机只好交了买路钱。呼吁有关部门采取措施予以制止。
