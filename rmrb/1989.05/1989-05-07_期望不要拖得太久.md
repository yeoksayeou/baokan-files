Title: Don't Let the Expectations Drag On Too Long

For many Chinese people, Sweden and "prosperity" are synonymous. But if one looks at Sweden's anti-bribery law, it seems that Swedes are much poorer than us.

For example, the law stipulates: If a government official or employee accepts a gift valued at 200 kronor or more, it is considered a criminal offense and will be subject to legal punishment.

What is the value of 200 Swedish kronor? It is roughly one-thirtieth of an ordinary Swedish person's monthly income. If any of us were to attempt bribery with such a value, we would likely be turned away at the door. But in Sweden, this already constitutes a criminal offense.

I once joked with a Swedish friend about this, saying: "In a 'courtesy nation,' it seems the Swedes are too unreasonable." He replied seriously: "We must do everything possible to separate power from money, otherwise power will corrupt. If a company boss gives a government official a gift, who can prove he has no ulterior motives? Gifts given to others always come with a request. Government officials repaying such kindness often means turning our taxes into the profits of businessmen. This is robbery! We must drive out the thugs and send them to where they belong."

This is indeed an old saying. What surprised me was the tone of this "foreigner"—he actually treats national officials as servants, and if they don't listen, he tells them to get out!

In our country, when "public servants" are hit by "golden bullets" and "silver bullets," they naturally face punishment—self-criticism, demotion, and in serious cases, they might even be "executed without mercy." However, those who are accustomed to elevating many issues to the level of principles have never cursed the recipients of bribes as "robbers" or "thugs." Perhaps it is precisely because we lack this disrespectful attitude towards "public servants" that the wind of bureaucratic corruption in China is so strong.

Perhaps I am speaking too strongly, because the matter is not so simple.

Our country has over two thousand years of feudal rule, so the baggage in people's minds is particularly heavy. Verbally, some of our cadres often say that the people are the "masters" and they are the "servants"; but in reality, some cadres consciously or unconsciously become the "masters," while treating the people as their "servants." When will our country's cadres truly see themselves as the people's "servants," and let the people treat them as "servants" to command? I hope it won't be too long. I believe it won't be too long.

　　期望不要拖得太久
    华剑阳
    对于不少中国人来说，瑞典和“富庶”是同一个词。但若看一看瑞典的反贿赂法，似乎瑞典人要比我们穷得多。
    例如，该法律规定：政府官员和工作人员若接受２００克朗以上价值的礼物，即为犯罪行为，就要受到法律制裁。
    这２００瑞典克朗价值多少呢？约为一个普通瑞典人月收入的三十分之一左右。倘若我们有谁拿着此等价值的礼品行贿，恐怕是要被拒之门外的。但在瑞典，这已经构成犯罪行为了。
    我曾为此与一位瑞典朋友半开玩笑地说：在一个“礼仪之邦”的公民看来，瑞典人太不近情理。他却正言道：“必须尽一切可能使权力与金钱脱钩，否则权力就会腐化。公司老板向政府官员赠送礼品，谁能证明他没有‘拉关系’之嫌？礼下于人，必有所求。政府官员要报答这种友情，常见的途径就是把我们纳的税变成商人的利润。这是抢劫！必须把流氓赶出去，送他们到该去的地方。”
    此番高论，实属老生常谈。令我感到新奇的是，此“老外”那极为不恭的口气——他竟把国家官员当成仆役，不听话就请滚蛋！
    在我们国家，当“公仆”被“金枪”“银弹”打得遍体鳞伤时，自然也要受到制裁——检讨、撤职，情节严重、行为恶劣的可能还要“格杀勿论”。但是，惯于对许多问题上纲上线的人们，却从没有把受贿者咒骂为“抢劫犯”、“流氓”的。或许正是因为我们缺乏对“公仆”的这种不恭敬的态度，中国的官僚腐败之风才刮得如此猛烈。
    大概言重了，因为事情并不如此简单。
    我们国家有两千多年封建统治的历史，因此人们头脑里因袭的包袱特别沉重。口头上，我们一些干部也常讲老百姓是“主人”，自己是“公仆”；但实际上，有的干部又自觉不自觉地当起“主人”来，而把老百姓看作是自己的“仆人”。什么时候，我们的国家干部真正把自己视为老百姓的“公仆”，让老百姓把自己当作“公仆”使唤呢？我期望不要拖得太久。我相信不会拖得太久。
