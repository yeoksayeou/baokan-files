The People's Liberation Army soldiers are the children of the people, nurtured by the people's milk. Loving the people and protecting the people is the duty of the people's children. History has proven and will continue to prove that an army that stands with the people is invincible. We salute the soldiers who love and protect the people!

According to reporters Wu Xuelin and Xu Rujun from a recent national defense education symposium held in Hebei Province, the people of Hebei Province, while striving for prosperity, have not forgotten the children of the people. They have wholeheartedly helped the army solve difficulties and support the construction of the people's army. Over the past year, various places have provided 7.5 million tons of fertilizers and diesel at subsidized prices to arrange for the production and living of military families. They have also adjusted the housing for more than 7,300 military families and solved employment, job transfers, and children's schooling issues for 16,100 military families.

In recent years, the troops stationed in various places in Hebei Province and local officers and soldiers have focused on building the army. Some have fought in battles to defend the country's borders and won military merits, while others have participated in military-civilian joint construction in the rear, strengthening the bond between the military and the people, and done a lot of work beneficial to the people. The provincial and local party committees, governments, and armed forces have seized the opportunity to strengthen national defense education, guiding the people to support the army's construction in a down-to-earth manner. Currently, the entire province has established "Excellent Soldier Award Funds" in 145 counties and cities, 1,790 townships, and 710 factories and mines, encouraging local soldiers to serve diligently and win merits for the people's interests. Over the past year, more than 5,000 soldiers have received awards from their hometowns. The armed forces, propaganda, and civil affairs departments regularly visit units where local soldiers are concentrated, reporting hometown information and the expectations of parents and fellow villagers to the soldiers, and understanding the soldiers' wishes and problems that need to be solved. Various places have also mobilized the soldiers' relatives to carry out the "Adding Glory to the Military Flag" activity, assisting the army in doing a good job of soldiers' ideological work, and solving past problems that the army alone could not solve, such as fake telegrams, fake certificates, and overstaying leave, promoting the growth and progress of the soldiers.

Helping military families solve difficulties has become a common practice in various places in Hebei. Various cities and counties implement the "four priorities" for military families: prioritizing the supply of scarce resources, prioritizing housing and homestead allocation, prioritizing employment and schooling for military family members, and prioritizing loans and wealth-creation projects. Various places have also established military family service stations and "Magpie Bridge" meetings to help soldiers solve marriage and love issues. Some places have even established "Military Family Litigation Affairs Offices" to help military families with legal issues. Liu Jinyu, a 63-year-old farmer from Xie County, who was once helped by the Eighth Route Army, has never forgotten the kindness of the people's army. In recent years, after working hard to become wealthy, he has saved money and donated 4.1 million yuan to support the army and help the poor, earning the love and respect of the army officers and soldiers.

Various places have established settlement cards and signed demobilization settlement agreements to do a good job of settling demobilized soldiers based on their performance in the army. In the past two years, the demobilized soldiers' two-use talent introduction offices in various places have recommended more than 50,000 workers to enterprises and institutions. Some individual entrepreneurs and businesspeople have taken the lead in organizing 231 enterprises mainly composed of demobilized soldiers, absorbing more than 10,000 rural demobilized soldiers. Many soldiers have said with emotion: "The common people trust and love the children of the people so much, and the children of the people should do things beneficial to the common people!"

　　爱人民的官兵受人民爱戴
    河北人民满腔热情为部队排忧解难
    官兵们表示：子弟兵要做有益于老百姓的事
    编者按：人民解放军官兵是人民的子弟兵，是吸吮人民的乳汁长大的。热爱人民，保护人民，是人民子弟兵的天职。历史已经证明并将继续证明，同人民站在一起的军队无往而不胜。我们谨向热爱人民、保护人民的子弟兵们致敬！
    本报讯　记者吴学林、徐如俊从最近召开的河北省国防教育座谈会上获悉，河北各地人民群众致富不忘子弟兵，满腔热情为部队排忧解难，支持人民军队建设。去年以来，各地为安排军人家庭的生产、生活，先后提供了平价化肥、柴油７．５万吨，为７３００多户军属调整了住房，为１６１００户军属解决了就业、调工种、子女入学等问题。
    近几年，河北省各地驻军和当地籍的干部战士安心部队建设，有的为参加保卫祖国边疆的战斗立下了战功，有的在后方参加军民共建，密切了军民鱼水情谊，做了大量有益于人民群众的工作。河北省各级党委、政府和武装部门及时抓住人民群众对人民军队的感激之情，强化国防教育，引导人民群众扎扎实实地支持部队建设。目前全省已有１４５个县市、１７９０个乡镇、７１０个厂矿设立了“优秀军人奖励基金”，鼓励本地籍战士安心服役，为保卫人民利益立功，去年以来已有５０００多名军人获得了家乡的奖励。武装、宣传、民政等部门，定期走访本地籍战士比较集中的部队，向战士们通报家乡信息和父老乡亲的嘱托，同时了解战士的愿望和需要解决的问题。各地还动员战士亲属开展“我为军旗添光彩”活动，配合部队共同做好战士思想工作，解决了过去单靠部队难以解决的假电报、假证明、探亲超假等问题，促进了战士的成长进步。
    为军人家庭排忧解难，在河北各地已蔚成风气。各市县对军人家庭实行优先供应紧俏物资、优先解决住房和宅基地、优先安排军人家属就业和子女入学入托、优先提供贷款和致富项目的“四优先”。各地还成立了军人家庭服务站和专为战士解决婚恋问题的“鹊桥会”，有的地方还成立了专门帮助军属打官司的“军属诉讼事务所”。当年受到八路军救助的涉县６３岁的农民刘金鱼，一直不忘人民军队的恩德，近几年勤劳致富以后，自己省吃俭用，先后拿出４１万元用于拥军扶贫，受到了部队官兵的爱戴。
    各地通过设立安置卡、签订退伍安置协议书等方式，根据他们在部队的表现，认真做好复员退伍军人的安置工作。近两年来，各地退伍军人两用人才介绍所，已向企事业单位推荐了５万多名职工。一些个体户和企业家带头组织起２３１个以退伍军人为主体的企业，吸收了万余名农村退伍军人。不少官兵感动地说：“老百姓这样信任和热爱子弟兵，子弟兵要做有益于老百姓的事！”
