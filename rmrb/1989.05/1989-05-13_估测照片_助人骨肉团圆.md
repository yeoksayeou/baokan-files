There are over 60,000 missing children in the United States, some of whom have been reported missing for years but remain unaccounted for. The reason is that children's appearances change over time, making it difficult for parents to recognize them after a few years; it is even more challenging for the police and other individuals to identify them based on old photographs.

In February of this year, scholars Baraus and Sadler from the University of Illinois successfully used a computer system to create "estimated photos" of children based on photographs taken several years ago.

After years of observation and research, these two scholars discovered that the growth of children's facial bones follows general patterns. They developed 39 data calculation formulas for the relative size and position changes of each facial feature. By inputting the relevant data, they can print an "estimated photo" that closely resembles a recent photograph in just a few minutes.

A New York financier offered to pay a large sum of money to have Baraus and his team create estimated photos of his young children as adults. However, this offer was politely declined. Sadler said, "Our goal is to help the police reopen dormant cases and reunite parents who have been worrying for years with their children who may still be alive."

　　“估测照片”助人骨肉团圆
    美国全国失踪儿童现有６万多人，其中一些虽已报案多年，但一直下落不明。原因是由于儿童相貌随岁月变化，几年间便“面目全非”，父母骤看之下也不易认出；靠警方和各界人士根据原有相片分辨更加困难。
    今年２月，依利诺斯大学学者巴劳斯和萨德勒利用计算机系统，根据几年前的照片描绘儿童“估测照片”取得成功。
    这两位学者经过长期的观察研究，发现儿童面部骨骼的生长有普遍规律可循，便拟出了每个颜面各器官相对大小和位置变化的３９个数据计算公式，只要输入有关资料，几分钟便可印出一张与实拍近照差别极小的“估测照片”。
    纽约一位金融家愿出重资请巴劳斯等人为身边的稚儿制作他日成年的估测照片。但被婉言谢绝。萨德勒说：“我们的目的是推动警方翻开蒙尘的案卷，为牵挂多年的父母找回也许尚在人间的骨肉。”
