Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 4th.

	Foreign Ministry spokesperson today said here that it is well known that China does not advocate, encourage, or engage in nuclear proliferation, nor does it assist other countries in developing nuclear weapons. Regarding reports that China will conduct a nuclear test for Pakistan, these are pure fabrications.

	The spokesperson made these remarks in response to recent reports in Indian newspapers quoting a British "Foreign Report" that claimed China would conduct a nuclear test for Pakistan in the near future.

	The spokesperson also said that a special meeting of the Arab League Council of Foreign Ministers held recently in Tunis adopted resolutions on issues such as achieving a ceasefire in Lebanon. He stated: "The Chinese government supports and appreciates the efforts of the Arab League to end the bloody conflicts in Lebanon and sincerely hopes that these efforts will be successful."

　　外交部发言人重申    
    中国不主张也不搞核扩散
    新华社北京５月４日电  外交部发言人今天在这里说，众所周知，中国不主张、不鼓励核扩散，也不从事核扩散，不帮助别的国家发展核武器。关于中国为巴基斯坦试验核弹的报道，纯属捏造。
    发言人是针对最近印度报纸转载英国“外事报导”的消息称，中国将在近期为巴基斯坦试验核弹一事作上述评论的。
    发言人还说，最近在突尼斯召开的阿盟理事会外长特别会议就黎巴嫩实现停火等问题通过了决议。他说：“中国政府支持和赞赏阿盟为结束黎巴嫩流血冲突所作出的努力，并衷心希望这一努力获得成功。”
