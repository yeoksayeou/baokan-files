In today's context of limited national strength and financial resources, can we still "squeeze out" more from the already overloaded railways?

I believe it is entirely possible. The solution lies in pursuing a path of internal potential and efficiency, striving to reduce friction and internal waste among various departments, and seeking efficiency through management to tap into transport capacity.

Railways are a "large interconnected machine." The degree of coordination among various departments and job roles in operational links directly affects the utilization of transport capacity. In the past, the primary performance indicators for railway operations focused on loading, unloading, and sorting (empty cars), without considering the characteristics and operational nature of each station. As a result, counterproductive situations arose. For instance, Nan Cang Station is the largest marshalling yard in our bureau. Previously, to complete the daily task of loading dozens of cars, the station had to "beg and plead" everywhere. Consequently, not only did this affect the station's own sorting tasks, but it also impacted the overall smooth operation of the bureau. In 1985, we implemented the "Transport Economic Responsibility System," adopting the approach of "focusing on key areas and guiding towards needs." This method attracted the enthusiasm of various units towards the overall needs of the bureau. After the reform, the bureau no longer assessed Nan Cang Station on loading tasks but instead focused on key areas, assessing the number of cars handled. Without adding any new equipment or personnel, Nan Cang Station's daily car handling capacity increased from 9,000 to a peak of 13,400, thereby alleviating the bottleneck issue at the Tianjin railway hub. Last year, we introduced the "Transport Full-Line Networking" method. With the bureau as the main system and stations as sub-systems, we implemented a tiered approach to organize transportation, forming a full-bureau network. We linked rewards to networking and ensured networking through rewards. The concept of "networking" united the "five fingers" of the Tianjin Railway Bureau—machines, cars, workers, electricity, and vehicles—into a single "fist." The 40 production stations and over 73,000 employees all played in harmony. Taking Gu Yi as an example, to reduce the time machines spend in the Gu Yi depot, Gu Yi Station and Gu Yi Locomotive Section worked closely together, creating methods such as "segmented entry" and "tandem entry." As a result, the average time for machines to enter the depot was reduced to 35 minutes, cutting it by more than half.

Implementing the Transport Economic Responsibility System and Transport Full-Line Networking has revitalized the stations, injecting vitality into the bureau. In 1988, the bureau's transport income reached 1.065 billion yuan, making it one of the top revenue-generating bureaus among the 56 in the country.

　　减少内耗发挥整体功能
    七届人大代表、天津铁路分局局长  王润生
    在国力、财力有限的今天，能否从已经超负荷运转的铁路上再“挤出”“油水”呢？
    我认为：完全可能。那就是走内涵挖潜之路，努力减少各部门间的磨擦和内耗，向管理要效率，挖运能。
    铁路是“大联动机”，各部门、各工种在作业环节中配合程度如何，直接制约着运输能力的发挥。过去，铁路对车务部门的主要考核指标是装（车），卸（车），排（空车），而不考虑各站段的特点和作业性质，结果出现使反劲的现象。如南仓站是我分局最大的编组站，过去为完成每天几十辆的装车任务四处“求爷爷告奶奶”。结果，不仅影响了本站改编任务，也影响了整个分局的畅通。１９８５年，我们制定实施“运输经济责任制”，采取“突出重点，导向需要”的做法，把各单位的积极性吸引到分局总体需要上来。改革以后，分局不再考核南仓站装车，而是抓住重点，考核办理车数。南仓站没增设备没添人，办理车数以过去的日均９０００辆直线上升，最高达１３４００辆，从而缓和了天津铁路枢纽“卡脖子”区段问题。去年，我们又推出了“运输全程联网”的办法。以分局为母系统，以站段为子系统，实行分层次开展组织运输。形成全分局的整体联网。以联网定联酬，以联酬保联心。一个“联”字，使天津铁路分局机、车、工、电、辆“五根指头”紧紧攥成一个“拳头”，４０个生产站段、７３０００多名职工“一人一把号，同吹一个调”。以古冶为例，为压缩古冶机车入库等线时间，古冶站与古冶机务段紧密配合，创造了“分段入库，重联入库”等方法，使机车入库时间平均下降到３５分钟，压缩了一倍多。
    实行运输经济责任制和运输全程联网后搞活了站段，给分局注入了活力。１９８８年，分局运输收入创１０．６５亿元，成为全路５６个分局中的收入大户。
