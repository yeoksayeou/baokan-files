The first session of the Soviet People's Congress, which opened today, saw democratic and lively discussions. Through a secret ballot, Gorbachev was elected as the first Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Today's meeting spent three hours nominating and discussing candidates for the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. The Kyrgyz writer Strumatoff was the first to speak, praising Gorbachev for "awakening the sleeping kingdom of stagnation" and bravely taking on the task of social reform, changing the image of the Soviet Union. He called on the representatives to elect Gorbachev as the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet.

Nearly 40 people then spoke in support, but many suggested avoiding excessive praise. Some advocated that Gorbachev resign from his position as the General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee to focus on state affairs. Others raised questions about certain mistakes in the reform, national issues, and privileges for leaders.

In his speech, Gorbachev admitted to significant mistakes in the reform, stating that the current period is the most difficult for the reform. He emphasized the need to learn democracy and engage in dialogue to unite Soviet society around the goal of reform. He will firmly implement the reform policies and oppose bureaucracy. He believes that the party and the highest positions in the Soviet should not be separated. Regarding the April clashes in Tbilisi, he said that the military should do its own job.

A 46-year-old non-party engineer, Obolensky, volunteered to run for the position of Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and spent 15 minutes introducing his election platform on legal, political, economic, and welfare issues. He said that compared to Gorbachev, his chances of winning were almost zero, but his action was to break the convention that high positions in the Soviet Union have only one candidate. His speech received enthusiastic applause.

Two representatives from the Sverdlovsk region, where Yeltsin worked, nominated Yeltsin as a candidate for the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. Yeltsin spoke carefully for three minutes. Although he believed that any position should have more than one candidate, he supported the reform and the decision of the 19th Party Congress regarding the leadership of the party and the Soviet. He requested the withdrawal of his candidacy.

After a long period of secret voting and counting, Gorbachev was finally elected as the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet with 2123 votes in favor and 87 votes against.

The highlight of today's meeting was the democratic and lively atmosphere. Speeches were concise and to the point. Whether it was the selection of the Presidium and the Election Committee, or whether Gorbachev should preside over the first meeting, or whether a discussion on a certain issue should be concluded, all were decided by a show of hands by all representatives, totaling 20 votes. Today, more than 80 people spoke, interjected, or asked questions on the spot. The famous nuclear physicist Sakharov spoke three times. Sometimes, more than ten people lined up to speak, with the longest speech lasting 20 minutes and the shortest 20 seconds. This completely changed the dull atmosphere of the "stagnation period" in the Soviet Union, where meetings were held according to the script and long speeches were given.

　　人民代表大会民主活泼　一扫停滞时期沉闷气氛
    戈氏当选苏最高苏维埃主席
    据新华社莫斯科５月２５日电  （记者盛世良）在今天开幕的首届苏联人民代表大会上，通过民主、活泼的讨论，以无计名投票方式选举戈尔巴乔夫为首任苏联最高苏维埃主席。
    在今天的会议上用了３小时提名并讨论最高苏维埃主席人选。吉尔吉斯作家史特马托夫率先发言赞扬戈尔巴乔夫“唤醒了沉睡的停滞王国”，勇敢地挑起社会革新的重担，使苏联改变了形象。他呼吁代表们选举戈尔巴乔夫为最高苏维埃主席。
    接着近４０人发言表示赞同，但不少人认为要避免溢美之辞，有人主张戈辞去苏共中央总书记职务，集中精力处理国家事务，还有人就改革中的某些失误、民族问题、领导人优惠条件等问题对戈尔巴乔夫提出质问。
    戈尔巴乔夫在发言时承认改革中有重大失误，目前是改革的最困难时期，应学习民主，通过对话，使苏联社会团结到改革这个大目标上来。他将坚决执行改革方针，反对官僚主义。他认为目前党与苏维埃最高职务不宜分开。在谈到今年４月第比利斯街头冲突时，他说，军队应干自己份内的事。
    ４６岁的非党人士、工程师奥博连斯基毛遂自荐要竞选最高苏维埃主席，并用１５分钟时间介绍了他在法制、政治、经济和福利方面的竞选纲领。他说，同戈尔巴乔夫相比，他的获胜机会几乎是零，但他的行动是为了打破苏联崇高职位的选举只有一个候选人的常规。他的发言博得热烈的掌声。
    叶利钦工作过的斯维尔德洛夫斯克地区有两位代表提名叶利钦为最高苏维埃主席候选人。叶利钦字斟句酌地作了３分钟发言。虽然他认为任何职务都应有一名以上候选人，但他拥护改革，拥护苏共第１９次代表会议有关党和苏维埃主要领导兼职的决议，请求撤销自己的候选人资格。
    经过长时间的无计名投票和计票，戈尔巴乔夫终以２１２３票赞成、８７票反对的结果当选苏联最高苏维埃主席。
    今天会议的特点是气氛民主活泼，发言短小精悍。不论是大会主席团和计票委员会人选，还是戈尔巴乔夫主持第一次会议是否合法，某项问题的讨论是否可结束，一律由全体代表举手表决，共表决２０次。在今天会上发言、插话、即席提问的，达８０多人次。著名核物理学家萨哈罗夫三次登台发言。有时十余人排队等候上台，发言长的２０分钟，短的２０秒，一扫苏联“停滞时期”开大会照本宣科、长篇大论的沉闷气氛。
