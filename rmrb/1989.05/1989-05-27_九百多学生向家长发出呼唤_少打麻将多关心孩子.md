In recent days, students from the Red Flag Tractor Factory's affiliated middle school and primary school in Anshan, Liaoning, have been writing letters to their parents, urging them to "play less mahjong and pay more attention to their children." By the time this article was submitted, the factory had received over 900 letters from students to their parents.

This factory is one of the largest in China's engineering machinery industry, with nearly 10,000 employees and over 1,300 children attending the affiliated schools. After work, a significant number of employees gather to play mahjong. The narrow living quarters are filled with smoke, and the clattering sound of mahjong tiles continues late into the night, disturbing the children's study and rest. Particularly, what started as a general pastime has turned into gambling, leading to disputes, fights, and even divorces in some families, casting a shadow over the children's young minds.

At the school's initiative, students have taken up their pens to write letters to their parents, appealing with their pure hearts: do not get lost in mahjong and gambling, do not forget the responsibilities and missions of being a parent, work diligently with full energy, care for the growth of the next generation, and maintain a harmonious family.

### 九百多学生向家长发出呼唤——少打麻将多关心孩子

　　九百多学生向家长发出呼唤——
    少打麻将多关心孩子
    近日来，辽宁鞍山红旗拖拉机厂子弟中学和子弟小学的学生纷纷给家长们写信，呼吁家长们“少打麻将，多关心孩子们”。到记者截稿为止，这个厂已收到学生给家长们的来信九百多封。
    这个厂是我国工程机械行业中最大的厂家，有职工近万人，子弟中小学生一千三百多人。下班后，相当部分职工聚集各家打麻将。狭小的住宅里烟雾弥漫，哗哗的推牌声响至深夜，扰得孩子们无法正常地学习和休息。尤其是从一般性的娱乐到动钱赌博，引起一些家庭争吵、打架、闹离婚等纠纷，给孩子们幼小的心灵蒙上一层阴影。
    在学校的倡导下，学生们纷纷动笔给自己的家长写劝告信，用他们纯洁的童心向家长们呼唤：不要再沉湎于麻将赌博之中，不要忘了家长的责任和使命，要用充沛的精力勤奋工作，要关心下一代成长，要维护好家庭的和睦。
