The People's Daily Overseas Edition "Wanghailou Essays" essay contest results were recently announced. The award ceremony was held on May 9 at the People's Daily headquarters. The 18 winning entries were selected through voting by the judges.

Xie Yun's "Can't We Tolerate Dissent at Home?" and essays by overseas students Yan Huan from the UK and Ding Zijiang from the US, titled "Pen Follows 'Wanghailou' to Look Out," won the first prize. Five authors received the second prize, and ten received the third prize.

Most of the entries were on contemporary themes, with topics closer to reality and more innovative than before. The range of authors has also expanded, particularly attracting writers from Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and overseas students from the US, Japan, and Western Europe, reflecting the unique characteristics of the overseas edition.

Judges Tang Dacheng, Mu Hui, and Li Huangwu spoke, noting that a significant feature of this contest was the "harmony of emotion and expression." The essays reflected deep feelings of nostalgia for the homeland, love for one's native land, and the emotions of a wandering soul, all of which were deeply moving.

The contest began on November 1, 1988, and ended on February 1989, lasting four months. A total of 826 submissions were received, with 84 published.

Judges from the Beijing area, award-winning authors, and representatives from sponsoring companies, totaling over 30 people, attended the ceremony. Representatives from the sponsoring companies, award-winning authors, and the editor-in-chief of the People's Daily, Tan Wenrui, all spoke at the event.
