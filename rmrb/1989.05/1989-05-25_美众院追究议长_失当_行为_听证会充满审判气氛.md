The U.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Ethics held its first hearing today regarding Speaker Jim Wright's personal financial issues that violated ethical regulations. The hearing was marked by intense confrontations between Wright's defense attorney, Bob Sussman, and special prosecutor Richard B. "Dick" Ferran, creating a "trial-like atmosphere."

Sussman, defending the "most powerful man in Congress," argued that due to public opinion demanding Wright's resignation and declaring him a "political corpse," someone had fabricated charges. He believed this was a Republican attempt to retaliate against the Democrats for blocking the nomination of John Tower as Secretary of Defense.

Ferran, who is leading the investigation into Wright's affairs, stated that Wright's violations of House rules were not just financial but also involved congressional ethics and "the confidence of the American people." He urged the ethics committee to maintain all the charges.

Local media speculated that Wright might become the first House Speaker in American history to be forced to step down due to ethical issues.

　　美众院追究议长“失当”行为
    听证会充满审判气氛
    本报华盛顿５月２３日电  记者仓立德报道：美国国会众议员道德委员会今天首次就众院议长赖特在个人经济问题上触犯道德法规举行听证会。在取消还是坚持对赖特的指控问题上，赖特的辩护律师苏斯曼与特别检察官费兰发生激烈对抗，听证会充满“审判气氛”。
    苏斯曼为这位“国会最有权势的人”辩护说，因为公众舆论要求赖特下台，宣布他是个政治“死人”，有人便以此种心态罗织罪名。他认为，这是共和党企图因托尔的国防部长提名未能在国会通过而对民主党报复。
    主持调查赖特问题的费兰则说，赖特违反众院规定不仅是经济问题，而且事关国会道德和“美国人民的信心”，因此要求道德委员会坚持各项指控。
    此间舆论认为，赖特有可能成为美国历史上第一位因道德问题而被迫下台的众院议长。
