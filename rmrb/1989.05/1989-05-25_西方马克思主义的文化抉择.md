Western Marxism emerged in the context of the failure of revolutions in Western European capitalist countries from the 1920s to the mid-1970s. It represents a specific exploration by Marxist followers on how to apply Marxism in Western countries. This is a distinct trend or tradition. We advocate for treating it from a pluralistic Marxist standpoint, rather than criticizing it as an opponent of Marxism. Therefore, the view that attempts to separate figures like Gramsci, Lukács, and Althusser from this tradition, then criticizes the relationship of this tradition with bourgeois philosophy, sociology, and psychoanalysis, and ultimately denies the tradition's affiliation with Marxism, is not thorough.

The founders of Marxism established the general principles of Marxism. Lenin's theory of socialist revolution in one country and the success of the October Revolution marked the beginning of the concretization of Marxism, leading to its diversification—such as the Soviet-style Marxism, Chinese-style Marxism (Mao Zedong Thought), Yugoslav-style Marxism, etc. These specific forms of Marxism are the result of creative applications and developments of Marxist general principles under different historical conditions and based on the unique cultural characteristics of different nations (here, "culture" is a broad concept that includes social institutions). This process is what we call the cultural choices of Marxism, resulting in diverse forms of Marxism.

The diversification of Marxism is not only evident in socialist countries that have successfully seized power but also in the explorations by intellectuals in contemporary capitalist countries who attempt to use Marxism in ways different from the East to transform their own societies. Western Marxism is one such exploration. Indeed, Western Marxism is internally diverse. If categorized by cultural characteristics, it can be roughly divided into Latin and Germanic (Frankfurt School) styles. Additionally, according to British scholar Perry Anderson, there is also the emerging Anglo-American style of Marxist culture, which is the "only formidable opponent" of contemporary bourgeoisie in Western Europe, and the Marxism of communist parties that are ideologically linked to the Soviet Union.

If we call the type of revolution represented by the October Revolution, the Chinese Revolution, and the revolutions led by communist parties in various countries as "weapon criticism" Marxism, then we can also call Western Marxism the pioneer of "cultural criticism" Marxism. Of course, any classification is relative. Weapon criticism must have cultural criticism as its premise and supplement. Cultural criticism, if not viewed from a short-sighted perspective, has profound historical significance in shaking up backward social systems and cleansing stagnant social consciousness, thereby contributing to national rejuvenation and development. When revolutionary conditions are ripe, weapon criticism is used to overthrow the old society and establish a new one. When the revolutionary subject's consciousness is not yet mature, cultural criticism is needed to awaken the masses.

In the process of spreading and practicing Marxism, various specific forms have emerged, and their fates are inevitable. Theory must be closely integrated with revolutionary practice, which is the essence of Marxism. In practice, each nation digests and understands classical theory in its own way, resulting in Marxism with national characteristics. Over the 100-plus years since the birth of Marxism, it has experienced different eras, and different eras have chosen Marxism with different historical characteristics. This is the diversification of Marxism. The diversification of Marxism is a sign of its prosperity and development.

Specifically, the revolution in the West must be different from the revolution in the East. The era threatened by nuclear war, which endangers the safety of all humanity (this indicates that violent revolution cannot be easily carried out today), is different from the era when war could trigger revolution. Gramsci once pointed out that the autocratic system of Eastern countries determined the success of their "mobile warfare" (rapid violent revolution), while in the West, with its flexible parliamentary democratic system, it is necessary to gradually seize the leadership of "civil society." Today, in Western societies, the question of what paths to take, what forces to rely on, and what kind of post-revolutionary society to build (a feasible socialist political structure and economic system in the West) are all issues that need to be extensively and deeply explored. Revolution cannot be exported. Therefore, we should allow them to explore on their own and acknowledge the positive significance of this exploration, rather than immediately criticizing it as an opponent.

This means that we should view "Western Marxism" from the perspective of national spirit and the spirit of the times. Facing repeated setbacks in revolution, long-term prosperity of capitalist economies, and the consolidation of parliamentary democratic systems, Marxist theoretical research has become detached from the workers' movement. In this context, in the birthplace of the European Renaissance in Italy, among the Gauls inspired by the "Free France Movement," and among the Germans with a rich tradition of contemplation on the subject-object relationship, batches of dedicated individuals have tirelessly followed Marx's path, exploring the issues of "human subjectivity and liberation," and bravely conducting social and cultural criticism. This reflects the influence of cultural traditions on the cultural choices of Marxism. If "Western Marxism" focuses on "pure culture" distant from the economic base, while the later Anglo-American Marxists emphasize the domains of economic and political structures, this further illustrates the differences between the ancient and largest capitalist countries' cultural traditions that emphasize practicality.

The temporal choices of Western Marxism are reflected in its exploration themes, which are always the most pressing issues in contemporary society. In the 1920s, Marxists like Lukács and Gramsci focused on summarizing the lessons of failed Western revolutions, analyzing the similarities and differences between Eastern and Western social structures, and the revolutionary methods that should be adopted; in response to the theorists of the Second International who turned Marxism into mechanical economic determinism and the decline of the proletariat's consciousness, they emphasized the subjectivity in Marxism. From the early 1930s to the late 1940s, around the rise of fascism, Reich and Fromm of the Frankfurt School focused on exploring psychological tendencies and personality structures, attempting to supplement the political and economic institutional analysis emphasized by classical Marxism with social psychology and analysis, and exploring the relationship between psychological revolution and social revolution. Post-war, in the long-term economic prosperity, the reification consciousness suppressed people's revolutionary consciousness and distorted their psychology. Thus, Western Marxism, characterized by cultural philosophy, took "the realization of the full return of human nature" as the core issue of cultural criticism, aiming to awaken people's revolutionary consciousness through the criticism of daily life and "cultural industry." In the long silence of social revolution in Western Europe, are these not forms of Marxism's integration with social reality?

Of course, viewing Western Marxism as a whole as a branch of Marxism does not overlook its internal "broad diversity." Among the important figures in the Western Marxist tradition, some are closer to Marxism, while others are farther; some were leaders of the communist party who participated in the proletarian revolutionary movement, while others were left-wing radical scholars in bourgeois academia. In any trend or group, there are left, center, and right factions, but this does not affect their overall status as a trend or group. In fact, even a single thinker or Marxist's thoughts are a process of continuous evolution.

Viewing this trend or tradition as a whole as a branch of Marxism also does not mean abandoning criticism of it. Criticism is a beautiful word, meaning to extract gold from the criticized object. Criticism is about refining, not like the "Cultural Revolution" where people wielded sticks to beat others or treated the object as a dead dog. Criticism is mutual; criticizing others also allows for others' criticism. Western Marxism has limitations, defects, and distortions, and needs historical criticism. Soviet Marxism also has errors and can be criticized. Mao Zedong Thought did not Mao Zedong Thought also took a detour during the "Cultural Revolution"; does it not need criticism? Criticism lies in self-reflection and self-criticism. "Unique revolution" and "unique Marxism" are the most unacceptable. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out that there are various kinds of Marxists, with 90%, 80%, 70%, etc. From this, we draw a lesson: Marxist followers' grasp of the Marxist spirit varies. But one thing is consistent: they all belong to the Marxist category. As for who better understands the essence of Marxism, history will judge, not self-proclamation. In China, we combine our national spirit with historical development to understand and practice Marxism. If this exploration represents a correct Marxist line in China, it cannot be used to dictate the Marxist characteristics of other countries and nations. Otherwise, if every country insists on "unique Marxism," denying and attacking others' explorations, it will ultimately negate the existence of Marxism in the contemporary world.

Criticism is a prism. The same historical facts can be viewed differently by critics. Even different theoretical starting points can lead to different value judgments. If we use our own understanding of materialism and dialectics to judge Western Marxism, the result might be that very little remains. But if we start from the perspective that criticism is about refining, and focus on the Western cultural background, we will inevitably discover many positive and valuable theoretical treasures in this tradition. This is what we need to, and are worth, investing great effort to explore, because it is the need for an open and developing Marxism. Regrettably, we have done far from enough in this regard.

Only by viewing Western Marxism from the perspective of the convergence of national spirit and the spirit of the times can we better understand its necessity and theoretical value. As for the relationship between this trend and Western philosophy, sociology, or psychoanalysis, there is no need to be overly concerned. It is well known that the establishment of Marxism absorbed the excellent cultural heritage of history and contemporaries. Lenin developed Marxism, and when he proposed the famous theory of imperialism, he also absorbed the analysis of the basic economic and political characteristics of imperialism from contemporary British economist Hobson's "Imperialism." The development of contemporary Marxism is the same; it can absorb thoughts that Marx overlooked from thinkers before Marx and, more importantly, critically excavate new things from the rich treasure trove of contemporary thoughts built on advanced scientific foundations. For example, the problem of psychoanalysis is not a theory lacking in classical Marxism? Contemporary Western philosophy, sociology, and psychoanalysis reflect the times and focus on urgent issues of the times, although they have the limitations of these thinkers' worldviews and class standpoints, we cannot dismiss them with a single word "reactionary." The connection between the Western Marxist tradition and various Western social sciences, from one aspect, reminds us that the development of contemporary Marxism especially needs to pay attention to horizontal sources of thought.

　　西方马克思主义的文化抉择
    余文烈
    “西方马克思主义”是在２０年代至７０年代中期西欧大陆发达资本主义国家革命失败后的特定环境下，一批马克思主义追随者对马克思主义如何在西方国家的运用的一种探索。它是一股具有特定含义的，客观存在的思潮或称之为传统。对此，我们主张从多样化的马克思主义的立场来平等对待它，而不是把它当作马克思主义的对立面进行批判。这样，那种企图把葛兰西、卢卡奇、阿尔都塞等少数几位共产党领导人从这一传统中分离出来，然后指责这一传统与资产阶级哲学、社会学和精神分析学的关系，而从整体上不承认这个传统属于马克思主义的观点，也是不彻底的。
    马克思主义的奠基人创立了马克思主义的一般原理。列宁的一国胜利理论和十月革命的成功，标志着马克思主义开始走向具体化，也有了多样化——出现了苏联式的马克思主义、中国式的马克思主义（毛泽东思想）、南斯拉夫式的马克思主义等等。这些具体形式的马克思主义都是在不同的历史条件下，根据各个民族不同的文化特点（这里的“文化”是包括社会制度在内的广义的概念）对马克思主义一般原理的创造性运用和发展，即马克思主义的文化抉择，而形成的风格各异的马克思主义形式。
    马克思主义的多样化不仅体现于成功地夺取了政权的社会主义国家，还包括当代资本主义国家内的一批仁人志士试图用不同于东方的方式运用马克思主义来改造本国社会的各种探索。西方马克思主义就属于这种探索之一。诚然，西方马克思主义内部也具有“广泛的多样性”，如果按文化特征大致可分为拉丁语系的和日耳曼的（法兰克福学派）两种风格。此外，按照英国学者佩里·安德森的说法，还有后起的英美式的马克思主义文化，西欧地区“当代资产阶级碰到的唯一有战斗力的对手”，而在意识形态上与苏联相联系的共产党的马克思主义。
    如果把十月革命、中国革命以及各国共产党的革命这种类型称为“武器批判”的马克思主义的话，那么又可以称西方马克思主义开创了“文化批判”类型的马克思主义。当然，任何一种划分都是相对的。武器的批判必须有文化批判作前提和补充。文化的批判，如果不是从急功近利的眼光看问题，那它对于落后的社会制度的冲击，对滞惰的社会意识的荡涤，从而对于民族的振兴与发展，具有不可估量的深远的历史意义。当革命条件成熟时，用武器的批判推翻旧社会，建立新社会。当革命主体意识尚未成熟时，文化批判是唤起民众意识的需要。
    在马克思主义的传播和实践过程中出现了各种各样的具体化形式，其命运必然如此。理论必须与革命实践密切结合，这是马克思主义的灵魂。在实践过程中，各民族都以自己的方式去消化理解经典理论，于是有了本民族特色的马克思主义。马克思主义诞生１００多年来经历了不同的时代，不同的时代精神选择了不同历史特色的马克思主义。这就是马克思主义的多样化。马克思主义的多样化是其兴旺发达的标志。
    具体说来，西方的革命必然不同于东方的革命，核战争威胁到整个人类生命安全的时代（这说明在今天不能轻易进行暴力革命）不同于战争可以引起革命的时代。葛兰西曾经指出，东方的专制国家制度决定了其“运动战”（快速的暴力革命）可以成功，而在西方那富有弹性的议会民主制度下却必须用逐步夺取“市民社会”领导权的办法。今天的西方社会，采取什么样的途径，依靠什么力量，建立什么样的革命后社会（在西方可行的社会主义政治结构和经济制度），都是需要广泛而深入进行探讨的问题。革命不能输出。那就应该允许他们自己去探索，要承认这种探索的积极意义，而不要一下子就把它推到对立面去批判。
    这就是说，要从民族精神和时代精神上去看待“西方马克思主义”。革命屡遭挫折，资本主义经济长期繁荣，议会民主制度日益巩固，马克思主义的理论研究脱离了工人运动的基础，在这种情况下，在欧洲文艺复兴发祥地的意大利，在一直受“自由法国运动”精神鼓舞的高卢人中间，以及在富于思辨传统、一直凝思着主客体关系的德意志民族中间，一批批有志者孜孜不倦地循着马克思的思路，探索“人的主体性和人的解放”问题，勇敢地进行社会文化批判，这正体现出文化传统对马克思主义的文化抉择。如果说“西方马克思主义”研究的是远离经济基础的“纯文化”，而后起的英美马克思主义者是侧重于经济与政治结构的领域的话，那也进一步具体说明前者的文化传统与后者这两个分别是最古老和最大的资本主义国家注重实用的文化传统的不同。
    西方马克思主义的时代抉择则表现在它探索的主题总是当时社会中人们最为关切的问题。２０年代，卢卡奇、葛兰西等马克思主义者侧重于总结西方革命失败的教训，分析东、西方社会结构的异同，以及由此所应采取的革命方式；针对第二国际的理论家把马克思主义变成机械的经济决定论、工人阶级意识消沉而突出阐发马克思主义中的主体性问题，从３０年代初至４０年代末，围绕法西斯主义兴起的社会心理基础，赖希和弗罗姆等法兰克福学派成员就致力于心理倾向和性格结构的探索，力图以社会心理和分析去补充经典马克思主义所注重的政治经济制度方面的分析，探索心理革命与社会革命的关系。战后，在长期的经济繁荣情况下，物化意识抑制了人们的革命意识，扭曲了人们的心理。于是以文化哲学为主要特征的西方马克思主义把“实现人性的全面复归”作为文化批判的核心问题，力图以日常生活批判和“文化工业”批判去唤起人们的革命意识。在西欧社会革命长期沉默的情况下，难道这些就不是马克思主义与社会现实的一种结合方式吗？
    当然，把西方马克思主义从整体上看作马克思主义的一个流派，并非忽略其内部具有的“广泛的多样性”。在西方马克思主义传统的那些重要人物中，有些离马克思主义近些，有些离马克思主义又远些；有些是曾投身于无产阶级革命运动的共产党领导人物，有些则是资产阶级学府中的左翼激进派学者。在任何思潮或群体中都有左、中、右，但这并不影响它们从总体上作为一股思潮或一个群体。其实，就是某一位思想家，某一位马克思主义者，其前后的思想也是一个不断演变的过程。
    把这股思潮或传统从整体上看作马克思主义的一个分支，也并非放弃对它进行批判。批判本来是个美好的字眼，它意味着要从批判对象中淘出金子。批判是淘金而不是像“文化大革命”那样拿着棍子去打人，或把对象当作死狗。批判是互相的，批判别人，也容许别人的批判。西方马克思主义有局限，有缺陷，还有歪曲之处，需要历史地批判。苏联的马克思主义也有错误，也可以批判。毛泽东思想在“文化大革命”中不也是走过弯路吗；难道不需要批判？批判还贵在反躬自问，自我批判。“唯我独革”、“唯我独马”是最要不得的。毛泽东同志曾经指出，有各种各样的马克思主义者，有百分之九十的，八十的，七十的等等。从这里我们得出一条启示，马克思主义的追随者对马克思主义精神的把握程度是各种各样的。但有一点是一致的，即他们都属于马克思主义范畴。至于到底谁对马克思主义的精神实质领略得比较好，这要靠历史去评判，而不是靠自封。在中国，我们用我们民族的精神结合历史的发展去理解和实践马克思主义，如果这种探索在中国代表了一条正确的马克思主义路线的话，它也不能被用来绳规别的国家和民族的马克思主义特色。否则，如果各国都“唯我独马”，从而否定、攻击别国的摸索，那势必反而从总体上否定了马克思主义在当今世界上的存在。
    批判是个多棱镜。同一的历史事实，批判者可以有不同的价值取向。甚至理论出发点的不同也会有不同的价值评判。如果以我们自己理解的唯物论和辩证法为规矩去取舍西方马克思主义，批判的结果也许就所剩无几了。但如果从批判是淘金这一宗旨出发，换一个角度，着重西方的文化背景，那就必然会发现这一传统中的许多积极可取的理论财富。这才是需要我们，也值得我们下大力气进行探讨的方面，因为它是发展开放的马克思主义的需要。遗憾的是我们在这方面恰恰做得远远不够。
    只有从民族精神和时代精神的汇合点上去看待西方马克思主义，才能更好地认识其存在的必然性和理论价值。至于这股思潮与西方哲学、社会学或精神分析学的关系问题，不应该大惊小怪。众所周知，马克思主义的创立吸取了历史上的和同时代的优秀文化财产。列宁发展了马克思主义，他在提出著名的帝国主义理论时，也吸取了同时代英国经济学家霍布森的《帝国主义论》等著作关于对帝国主义的基本经济特点和政治特点的分析。当代的马克思主义的发展同样如此，不仅可以从马克思以前的思想家中去吸取为马克思所绕过去的思想，更要从当代建立在发达的科学基础上的丰富思想宝库中去批判挖掘新东西。例如心理分析问题，不正是古典马克思主义所欠缺的理论吗？当代西方哲学、社会学、精神分析学是时代的反映，关注了时代的迫切问题，虽然带有这些思想家的世界观和阶级观点的局限性，但我们不能说一声“反动”而了结。西方马克思主义传统与西方各社会学科的联系，从一个方面提醒我们，当代马克思主义的发展特别需要重视横向思想来源。
