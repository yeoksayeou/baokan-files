A sports goods store in the ancient city of Nanjing sells an average of thirty pairs of the latest trendy "Nike" sneakers, twenty-five sets of "Adidas" sportswear, and nearly ten sets of golf attire daily. More than half of these items are purchased by middle school students carrying book bags.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the trend of high consumption prevalent in society is increasingly infiltrating middle school students.

A survey conducted by a middle school in Nanjing among 232 students in the first year revealed: 63% of the students own woolen clothing and high-end wool sweaters. Among male students, 23% frequently smoke high-end cigarettes, and 45% of female students regularly use high-end cosmetics or get their hair permed at salons.

Many parents use material incentives to reward their children based on their academic performance. One parent made a verbal agreement with their son in the third year of junior high school: for every exam score above 96, the son would receive 100 yuan in pocket money. For every five-point drop in the average score, the pocket money would be reduced by 20 yuan. Another parent set a rule that the daughter would receive a gift of a certain value based on her exam scores. Therefore, students refer to their report cards as "exchange vouchers."

To earn money, some students start businesses during their free time, such as reselling movie tickets.

Facing the high consumption trend among middle school students, schools, parents, and teachers are worried. Experts concerned about this issue believe that the high consumption among middle school students is a result of mutual comparison. Some parents overly indulge their children, measuring their care and love by the amount of money and gifts they give, further fueling the students' abnormal consumption psychology. Faced with the impact of a commodity economy, some schools seem helpless.

### 互相攀比　追求刺激  南京中学生盛行高消费

　　互相攀比　追求刺激    
    南京中学生盛行高消费
    本报讯  古城南京一家体育用品商店，平均每天卖出当今最流行的“耐克”运动鞋三十双、“阿迪达斯”运动衫二十五套、高尔夫球服近十套，其中一半以上是被肩挎书包的中学生买走的。
    据中新社报道，时下，社会上盛行的高消费之风，正越来越严重地渗透到中学生中间。
    据南京一所中学对高一年级的二百三十二名学生调查表明：学生中有呢绒服装、高级羊毛衫的占百分之六十三，男生中经常抽中高档香烟的占男生总数的百分之二十三，女生中常年用高档化妆品或定期到发廊烫发的占女生总人数的百分之四十五。
    相当一部分家长用物质刺激的方法，按儿女成绩高低“奖励”给相应的钱或物品。一位家长和读初三的儿子订立“口头合同”，儿子每次考试成绩在九十六分以上，就给一百元零花钱，平均成绩每减少五分，零用钱就减少二十元。另一位家长则规定女儿考分达到哪个等级就给买一件多少价格的物品。因此，中学生把自己的成绩单称为“兑换券”。
    为了得到钱，一些中学生课余时间开始做生意，倒卖电影票等。
    面对中学生消费热，学校、家长、教师感到忧心忡忡。关注此风的有关人士认为，中学生消费热是互相攀比的结果，部分家长过分宠爱子女，以钱物衡量自己对子女关心和爱的程度，更助长了中学生的不正常消费心理。面对商品经济的冲击，一些学校似乎束手无策。
