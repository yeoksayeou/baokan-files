	Moving Mountains with Bare Hands
		By Lai Renqiong, People's Daily Reporter

		“Deformed Hands”

		“Take a look at our hands,” said Zhang Zheng, the chief of the sorting department at the Beijing Post Office, as he and his colleagues extended their hands for me to see. The thickened knuckles and inward-curled fingernails on their hands surprised me. Zhang Zheng explained, “Because we constantly grab mailbags, many workers’ hands have become deformed.”

		In the courtyard of the Beijing Postal Express Bureau, trucks and cars are loaded with mailbags. Inside the operation area, workers are sorting mailbags by region. Except for airmail, all incoming, outgoing, and transiting mail in Beijing must be handled by these workers, who load and unload the mailbags onto and off trains. The mailbags pass through the workers’ hands seven or eight times during the sorting, checking, and loading processes. On the platform, each worker lifts an average of 20 tons of mail per day, while those sorting in the warehouse handle up to 30 tons. Each mailbag weighs 25 kilograms. Day after day, year after year, if all the mail handled by these workers were piled up, it would form millions of impressive “mail mountains”!

		On the platform, although hurried travelers rarely notice the mail handlers covered in dirt, the giant-like Beijing Station fully understands the great contributions made by these ordinary workers in their silent and unnoticed efforts!

		“We Get Wet, But the Mail Doesn’t”

		The workers do not mind the hard work and fatigue, but they fear rain. In 1985, a heavy rain soaked 100,000 mailbags, and the workers still remember this incident with pain.

		In recent years, the volume of mail has been increasing, but the capacity and labor force have not kept up, leading to a severe mismatch between supply and demand. The piled-up mail makes the already cramped space even more crowded. After sorting, the mailbags, without a place to wait for dispatch, are moved to the platform in advance. On sunny days, it’s manageable, but during the rainy season, from managers to workers, everyone listens to the weather forecast multiple times a day and keeps an eye on the sky. Last summer, it often rained during shift changes. Some workers would grab rain covers and rush to the platform, while others would take off their raincoats to cover the mail. When it rained heavily, a few people would hold up a large rain cover on the car, and others would work quickly under this small rain-free area. Sometimes, the workers’ clothes would get wet multiple times a day and then dry from their body heat.

		“Don’t worry, we get wet, but the mail won’t,” the workers always say to their supervisors during the rainy season. With this assurance, what more could the supervisors worry about?

		“Back Pain Isn’t a Disease”

		After handling tens of thousands of mailbags, most workers suffer from back and leg pain, stomach issues, tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other ailments. Someone told me, “Here, back pain isn’t considered a disease. Young men are competitive and no one takes leave because of it.” In the past year, the railway has focused on safety, and trains often run late, disrupting their work schedule, extending their working hours, and even cutting into their meal times. Sometimes, they have only a few minutes between loading and unloading two trains to eat, and they don’t have time to wash their hands. They grab two steamed buns from the canteen and leave, with no time to eat slowly. Therefore, not only do some people have stomach pain, but even common diseases like conjunctivitis, tuberculosis, and hepatitis have affected these young and strong workers.

		The rough and straightforward mail handlers have a great sense of humor: “Working here, you can inhale dust from all over the world.” Domestic and international trains coming and going bring not only information but also bacteria, viruses, and dust. The mail handlers, who receive piecework wages, have no health subsidies or dust inhalation allowances. In the overloaded mail industry, they are also overloaded in their contributions.

		Friend: As you are about to board the train and leave Beijing, don’t forget to glance at the platform where those sweaty young men are busy loading mail. Newspapers, letters, and parcels are delivered through their hands, bringing information and joy to thousands of households!

### 双手搬走千座“山”

　　双手搬走千座“山”
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    “变形的手”
    “您看看我们这双手。”在北京邮政局采访，转运科长常征先叫大伙儿伸出手来让我看。一双双指关节变粗，指甲朝里卷的手令我惊讶不已。常征说：“因为长期用手抓邮袋，不少工人手都变形了。”
    北京邮政干线局的大院里，一辆辆拖车、汽车装满了邮袋。作业区内，工人们正在按地区分拣一袋袋邮件。除航空邮件外，北京进、出、转口邮件全得经过这里转运工的手一袋袋装上或卸下火车。邮袋在转运工手中通过分拣、查对、装拖车等工序，码列火车上得搬动七八次。站台上作业的工人平均每人每天负重２０吨左右，而在库房分拣的工人则达３０吨之多。每个邮袋重２５公斤，日复一日，年复一年，如果把转运工用双手搬走的邮件堆积起来，该是千万座蔚为壮观的“邮山”！
    站台上，虽然行色匆匆的旅客谁也未曾留意那些满身脏土的邮件转运工，而巨人般屹立的北京站却最了解这些平凡工人在默默无闻中装装卸卸的伟大奉献！
    “我们淋湿了，邮件也湿不了”
    转运工苦累全不怕，但就怕下雨。１９８５年，一场大雨让积压的１０万袋邮件泡汤，提起这事儿，转运工至今仍痛心疾首。
    近几年，用邮量不断增加，但运能与运量、劳力与工作量严重失调。堆积如山的邮件使狭小的场地更加拥挤。分拣后的邮件无待发场地堆放，工人们便提前运到站台。晴天还好说，遇到雨季，从干部到工人。天天几次听天气预报，时时留神老天爷变脸。去年夏天，老赶上下班时下雨，有的工人拿了雨布就往站台跑，有的工人干脆脱下自己的雨衣盖邮件。赶上下大雨时装车卸车，车上车下几个人扯开一块大雨布，另外几人便在这小小的无雨区紧张地装卸。有时工人们一天中几次被雨淋湿的衣服又几次被体温烘干。
    “你放心，我们淋湿了邮件也湿不了！”每逢雨季，转运工总对下达任务的“头儿”这么说。有了这句话，“头儿”还有什么不放心的呢！
    “腰疼不算病”
    成千上万次地搬运邮袋，转运工们大多患有腰腿痛、胃病、结核、肝炎等。有人告诉我：“在我们这儿，腰痛不算病。小伙子争强好胜，没有人因此而病休。”近一年，铁路抓安全，火车大多晚点，不仅打乱了他们的工作秩序，延长了工作时间，连吃饭的时间也常常被挤掉。有时在装、卸两次车中间的十几分钟里吃饭，工人们顾不上洗手，到食堂拿两个馒头就走，更没功夫细嚼慢咽。因此，不光有人胃痛，连社会上流行的红眼病、结核、肝炎都来寻找过这些年青力壮的小伙儿。
    粗犷、豪放的转运工极富幽默感：“在这儿干活，可以吸全世界的土”。南来北往的国内、国际列车，邮包中带着信息也带着细菌、病毒和尘土。领取计件工资的转运工没有什么保健费、吸尘费，在邮政业超负荷运转中，他们也在超负荷地奉献。
    朋友：当你就要登车离开北京时，别忘了看一眼站台上紧张装运邮件的那些满脸淌汗的小伙儿、报纸、信函、包裹经他们之手传递，他们为千家万户送去了信息和欢乐！
