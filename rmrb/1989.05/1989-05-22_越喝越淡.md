Title: The More You Drink, the More Diluted It Becomes

The more you drink tea after adding several rounds of hot water, the more diluted the taste becomes, which is normal. The issue is that nowadays, some things are like drinking tea; the more you engage in them, the more diluted they become. In many places, when starting a task, there is initially a strict mobilization, but later, it turns into a mere formality. For example, when evaluating technical titles, it was initially both sacred and mysterious. Those who were qualified had a hard time passing, but later, it became very lenient, like herding ducks across a river, one batch after another, even those of inferior quality were promoted. This kind of strictness at the beginning and laxity later on also makes the efforts increasingly diluted.

Tea that has become diluted can be "forgiven and forgotten." However, people hope that the ongoing efforts in investigating "official profiteering," "rectification," "regulation," "reducing the scale of basic construction," and other areas will not repeat the old habit of becoming increasingly diluted.

### “越喝越淡”

　　“越喝越淡”
    喝茶加过几次开水，味道“越喝越淡”是正常的。问题是，而今有些事，很像喝茶，越喝越淡。许多地方干某件工作起先动员时，严格要求，后来，却闹成认认真真走过场。如评技术职称，先是既神圣又神秘，本属够格的，却难于通过，后来，又放得很宽，像赶鸭子过河，一排一排地，质地差的也一样进档次。这种前紧后松，也越搞越淡。
    喝淡了的茶，可以“既往不咎”。可是人们却希望眼下正在进行的查“官倒”、“治理”、“整顿”、“压缩基本建设规模”等，千万别再犯老毛病“越搞越淡”。
