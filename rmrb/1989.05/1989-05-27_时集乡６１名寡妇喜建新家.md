	61 widows in Shijiang Township, who have been widowed for many years, rely on legal weapons to break through feudal notions, remarry, and rebuild happy new families.

	Most of these 61 women lost their husbands in their middle or young ages. The longest time of widowhood is over ten years. In the past, they wanted to remarry but generally had three fears: first, fearing that their children would blame them and their families would oppose them; second, fearing that they would offend the "spirit" of their former husbands; third, fearing that remarriage would constitute the crime of "bigamy."

	With the deepening of universal legal education, the township women's federation organized efforts, using various forms to lecture on the "Marriage Law" in each village and group, encouraging widowed women to break through old notions and pursue new lives. Shi Ji Village, Group Four farmer Xu Lian, lost her husband shortly after marriage. Originally, she held the idea of being faithful to one man for life. Later, village cadres repeatedly visited her home to explain the law, making her understand the legality of remarriage. Not long ago, she married Zhang Minghua from a neighboring village.

　　时集乡６１名寡妇喜建新家
    本报讯  江苏省新沂县时集乡守寡多年的６１名妇女，依靠法律武器冲破封建观念，改嫁重建幸福的新家庭。
    这６１名妇女多数是中青年时丧夫，守寡时间最长的达十多年。过去，她们想改嫁但普遍存在着三怕：一怕子女埋怨、家族反对；二怕触犯前夫的“阴魂”；三怕再婚会犯“重婚罪”。
    随着全民普法教育的深入，乡妇联组织力量，运用多种形式到各村组宣讲《婚姻法》，鼓励丧夫妇女冲破旧观念，追求新生活。时集村四组农民许莲，结婚不久丈夫便病故了。原先她抱定从一而终的念头。后来乡村干部多次上门讲法，使她明白改嫁合法的道理。前不久，她和邻村张明华结了婚。
