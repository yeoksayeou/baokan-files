Cai Xuexiong has been the manager of the Jiangsu Wujiang County Silk Industry Company for over a decade. When discussing the current situation of China's silk industry, he can't help but furrow his brow. He said, "The silk industry is facing a crisis of shrinkage!"

China is a "star" in the global silk production and export market. In recent years, China's mulberry silkworm production has accounted for approximately 70% of the world's total, and silk production has accounted for 66%; silk and silk fabric exports have accounted for 90% and 45% of the world's silk trade volume, respectively, earning nearly $1.7 billion in foreign exchange annually. How are silk prices in the global market? They all depend on China's quotations.

However, the "star" status is facing challenges from various aspects. Manager Cai said that due to the imbalanced structure within the silk industry, small and large factories are competing for resources, and the increasing demand in the international market has led to more frequent "cocoon-silk wars." Some Chinese companies have delayed deliveries and reduced quality in silk exports, severely damaging the "star" image. The management of silk export prices is chaotic, and the smuggling of goods is rampant, threatening China's dominant position in the global silk market. Can the silk industry remain prosperous forever? This is a question that economists in China are concerned about recently.

Manager Cai said, "The inverted pyramid structure of the industry is one of the main crises facing the silk industry today." In recent years, the development speed of silk processing and production in the country has exceeded the growth rate of raw materials, leading to an excess of silk over cocoons. Coupled with issues in the allocation and management of raw materials, some old silk enterprises are facing a situation where they have no raw materials to work with and are in a state of stop-and-go. Take Wujiang County as an example: last year, it produced 130,000 piculs of cocoons, but could only reel 985 tons of silk, while the silk consumption for weaving was over 3,000 tons. In the past, the shortage of silk could be solved by the superior authorities, but now it is difficult to allocate, making it difficult to continue the production and export of genuine silk fabrics. The confusion and worry have added many white hairs to Cai, the manager who holds the "money tree," and also led him to find many countermeasures.

Countermeasure One: Optimize the industrial structure, shifting from long-term expansion of production capacity and employment to focus on internal potential and expanding final products. Wujiang's silk exports are mainly fabrics, and the export of high-exchange-rate genuine silk garments is just starting, with less than 1 million pieces last year. Controlling the capacity of silk fabric processing and converting some weaving enterprises or workshops to produce silk garments and finished products is the inevitable path for Wujiang silk to expand exports.

Countermeasure Two: Increase cocoon production and stabilize silk production. Wujiang has unique advantages in the development of cocoon-silk production, with a higher output rate than other regions. Appropriately expanding the area of mulberry silkworms and using the created foreign exchange to import some grain is a worthwhile investment; utilizing the "ten edges" of land, scientifically breeding silkworms, and improving the unit area yield can increase the self-sufficiency rate of genuine silk raw materials in the county from 25% to 35%. To stabilize silk production, the first step is to focus on product quality and upgrading. This year, medium and low-end products will be shifted to high and medium-end products, extending fine and deep processing, with the county increasing 1.2 million meters of dyed silk and 500,000 meters of printed silk, aiming to create $20 million in foreign exchange. Secondly, utilizing Wujiang's advantage in genuine silk weaving, accepting processing of materials from other places, and easing the contradiction of insufficient raw materials.

Countermeasure Three: Develop polyester imitation silk production and strengthen technological transformation, opening up a new field of silk production—imitation silk.

Cai Xuexiong said that some developed countries use advanced technology to carry out fine and deep processing, vigorously developing high-end silk and garments, and occupying the international market. Wujiang should take the lead in technological progress, both conducting research in high technologies such as microelectronics, information, biotechnology, and new materials to narrow the gap with Western developed countries, and adopting forms of cooperation, joint ventures, and joint operations to gradually introduce foreign technology, management, and equipment into China's traditional silk production, thereby improving the level of silk production.

　　丝绸经理说丝绸
    沈惠忠　陆振华
    蔡雪熊担任江苏吴江县丝绸工业公司经理十多年，讲到我国丝绸业面临的形势，不禁皱起眉头。他说：“丝绸业潜伏着萎缩的危机！”
    我国是世界丝绸生产和出口的“明星”。近年来，我国的桑蚕产量约占世界总产量的７０％，桑蚕丝产量占６６％；生丝和绸缎出口量分别占世界丝绸贸易量的９０％和４５％，年创汇近１７亿美元。世界市场丝绸价格如何？都要看看中国的报价。
    但是，“明星”地位受到各方面的挑战。蔡经理说，由于丝绸行业内部结构失调，小厂和大厂“争食”，国际市场需求增加，引发出越来越频繁的“茧丝大战”；我国有些公司丝绸出口交货不及时，质量下降，已严重损害了“明星”形象；丝绸出口价格管理混乱，水货禁而不止，已危及我国在世界丝绸市场的主导地位。丝绸业能永盛不衰吗？这是近来我国经济界人士关心的问题。
    蔡经理说：“倒宝塔型的产业结构，是当前丝绸业的主要危机之一。”近年来，国内丝绸加工生产的发展速度超过了原料增长速度，绸大于丝，丝大于茧。再加上原料调拨和管理上的问题，使一些丝绸老企业处于无米下锅和停停开开状态。就说吴江县，去年产茧１３万担，可缫丝９８５吨，而织绸耗丝在３０００吨以上。过去缺口丝可由上级主管部门调拨解决，而现在也难于调拨，真丝绸生产和出口难以为继。困惑、忧虑使这位掌握着“摇钱树”的蔡经理平添了许多白发，也找到了不少对策。
    对策一：优化产业结构，从长期扩机增人增产面料为主转向内涵挖潜、拓展最终产品为主。吴江丝绸出口基本上以面料为主，换汇率高的真丝绸服装出口刚起步，去年不足１００万件。控制绸缎加工能力，将部分织造企业或车间转产丝绸服装及制成品上来，这是吴江丝绸扩大出口必由之路。
    对策二：增茧稳绸。吴江发展茧丝绸生产有得天独厚的优势，产出率比其它地区高。适当扩大桑蚕面积，用增创的外汇进口一部分粮食，是合算的；利用“十边”隙地，科学养蚕，提高单位面积产量，全县真丝原料自给率可由２５％提高到３５％。稳绸，首先要抓产品质量和升档升级。今年中低档产品向高中档产品转移，延伸精、深加工，全县增加１２０万米染色绸和５０万米印花绸，争创外汇２００万美元。其次，利用吴江真丝绸织造的优势，承接各地来料加工，缓和自身原料不足的矛盾。
    对策三：发展涤纶仿真丝生产和加强技术改造，开辟新的丝绸生产领域——仿真丝。
    蔡雪熊说，一些发达国家利用先进技术，通过精、深加工，大力发展高档丝绸和服装，占领国际市场。吴江应该在科技进步上领先一步，既要开展微电子、信息、生物工程和新材料等高等技术的研究工作，缩小同西方发达国家的差距；又要采用中外合作、合资、联合经营等形式，逐步将海外的技术、管理、设备移植到我国传统的丝绸生产中去，借以提高丝绸生产水平。
