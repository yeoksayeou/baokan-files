	Telephone Emergency Assistance
	By Luo Jinbiao, Reporter for This Paper

	In Italy, telephone emergency assistance is a special service designed for individuals living alone. These individuals, whether elderly or ill, find it difficult to move around and hope to have someone to turn to in times of need.

	Those who receive telephone emergency assistance only need a telephone that their neighbors can access. They are provided with a micro-sized, numerically controlled signal transmitter (i.e., a telephone controller) weighing just twenty grams, which can be worn around the neck like a large medal. In case of an emergency, they only need to press a button, and a signal receiver within a radius of one hundred meters, connected to the telephone, will receive the signal and automatically transmit the alarm signal through the telephone to the emergency assistance center. Within a few seconds, the user's information card will appear on the electronic computer screen at the emergency assistance center. The staff on duty 24 hours a day at the center will immediately call the user to understand the specific reason for the distress call. If the user cannot answer the phone, a "major alarm" will sound, alerting neighbors or relatives to check on the situation. The emergency assistance center can then dispatch an emergency team (including doctors and ambulances) to the location of the distress call based on the situation.

	The Italian telephone company, in cooperation with relevant departments, began piloting this telephone emergency assistance service in 1984. It has since been promoted in many regions, including Veneto and Lombardy, with over ten thousand users. According to a survey of three thousand users in the Veneto region, the majority of users are elderly individuals who can still manage their daily lives but feel lonely. On average, there are 240,000 distress calls per month. This service is widely welcomed, and users feel secure and at ease. The telephone emergency assistance method has also saved elderly individuals from robberies. The emergency center does not just wait for users to call for help; a significant part of their work is to establish contact with users. Center staff members call each user daily or weekly to inquire about their health and needs. The staff members have good professional qualities, are humble and cautious, enthusiastic, decisive, and always show concern and warmth to their service recipients.

	In the context of an increasingly aging population, the telephone emergency assistance service has enormous potential for development. The biggest problem for the elderly is loneliness and the inability to manage their daily lives. Many elderly individuals are forced to live in nursing homes or hospitals for extended periods, which is not beneficial for them or the country. In Italy, the cost of living in a nursing home is 60,000 lira per day, and the cost of living in a hospital is 300,000 lira per day, which is a significant economic burden. Generally, the elderly prefer to live in their own homes, where they are familiar with the environment and can maintain their living habits.

　　电话急救
    本报记者  罗晋标 
    在意大利，电话急救是为单独生活者所设的一种特殊服务。这些单独生活者，或因年迈，或因有病，走动不便，希望在需要时候能找到帮助他们的人。
    接受电话急救的人，只要有一部邻居可以接收的电话机就行。他可以领到一台仅重二十克的微型数控信号发射机（即电话控制器），像个大奖章一样挂在脖子上。必要时，只需按一下按钮，百米圈内的一个与电话机连通的信号收发机即可收到信号，并自动地通过电话机把报警信号传到电话急救中心。几秒钟后，电话急救中心的电子计算机屏幕上即出现用户卡片，每天二十四小时值班的急救中心工作人员立即打电话给用户，以了解呼救的具体原因，如用户不能接电话，则响起“大警报”，叫邻居或亲友了解究竟发生了什么事。电话急救中心可根据情况立即派出急救小组（包括医生、救护车等）到呼救地点。
    意大利电话局与有关部门合作，从一九八四年起试行上述电话急救服务项目，目前已在威尼托、隆巴迪等许多地区推广，用户已逾万人。据对威尼托大区的三千名用户的调查，用户绝大多数为生活基本尚能自理的孤独老人，平均每月呼救电话二点四万次，这种服务受到普遍欢迎，用户感到安全、放心。电话急救这种办法，还救了遭抢劫的老年人。急救中心不光是等待用户呼救，更大量的工作是建立与用户之间的联系。中心工作人员每天或每周同各用户联系，了解其健康状况及有何需要。工作人员具有良好的职业素质，谦虚谨慎，热情，办事果断，总是给服务对象以关心和温暖。
    在人口老龄化问题日益突出的情况下，电话急救这种服务事业有着巨大的发展潜力。老年人的最大问题是孤独和生活无法自理，许多老年人因此而不得不长期住疗养院或医院，这对本人和对国家都不是好事。在意大利，住疗养院一天要六万里拉，住医院一天三十万里拉，这是一项沉重的经济负担。而老人一般愿意住在自己家里，这里有熟悉的环境，可以保持自己的生活习惯。
