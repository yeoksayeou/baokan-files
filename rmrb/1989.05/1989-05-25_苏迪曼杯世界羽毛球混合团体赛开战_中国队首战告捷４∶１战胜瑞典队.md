The Sudirman Cup World Badminton Mixed Team Tournament Begins: China Team Wins First Match 4:1 Against Sweden

New China News Agency, Jakarta, May 24 (Reporters Liang Jinxiong, Zhou Zongxin) The first Sudirman Cup World Badminton Mixed Team Tournament opened today at the Senayan Sports Hall here. The China team won its first match, defeating the Swedish team 4:1.

Today, 24 teams in seven categories competed in four venues. The A-level teams, China and the host Indonesia, had already defeated Sweden and England, respectively, by the time this report was filed.

The China team's first match tonight was the mixed doubles pair of Nong Qunhua and Jiang Guoliang. They easily won the first set 15:5, but performed poorly in the next two sets, losing 16:18, 2:15 to Olsson and Bentsson. Following them, Yang Yang, Han Aiping, and Li Yongbo/Tian Bingyi all won their matches 2:0. In the final women's doubles match, Sun Xiaqing and Zhou Lei narrowly defeated K. Bentsson and M. Bentsson 2:1.

The Indonesian team defeated England 5:0 without losing a single set.

The results of the other six categories' matches today were as follows: B-level, Malaysia defeated Japan 3:2; C-level, Chinese Taipei defeated Canada 3:2, Thailand defeated Hong Kong 4:1; D-level, Australia defeated Poland 3:2, Scotland defeated West Germany 3:2; E-level, Finland defeated the United States 5:0, New Zealand defeated Austria 5:0; F-level, Norway defeated Nepal 5:0; G-level, Bulgaria defeated Mauritius 5:0, the Netherlands defeated the Soviet Union 3:2.

Jakarta is located near the equator, with a hot and humid climate. According to Han Aiping, although the Chinese athletes have been here for four days, they still have not adapted to the climate. The Indonesian team, in order to prevent the Sudirman Cup from "going abroad," has modified the lighting equipment in the gymnasium and has been training there for several months. Xiong Guobao told reporters that the lighting is too strong, and we are not yet adapted to it. Moreover, the strong lights increase the temperature inside the gymnasium, making European and other countries' athletes, who are already uncomfortable with the heat, even more so.

According to the organizing committee, out of the 30 teams that originally signed up for the Sudirman Cup, the Indian and Pakistani teams have withdrawn. Tomorrow night, the China team will face Denmark.

　　苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛开战
    中国队首战告捷４∶１战胜瑞典队
    新华社雅加达５月２４日电  （记者梁金雄、周宗欣）第一届苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛今天在这里的塞纳扬体育馆揭开战幕。中国队首战告捷，以４∶１战胜瑞典队。
    今天七个级别的２４支球队在四个场地上捉对较量。Ａ级的中国队和东道主印度尼西亚队在记者发稿时为止，已战胜瑞典队和英格兰队。
    中国队今晚首先出场的是混双选手农群华／蒋国良，他俩先以１５∶５轻松取下第一局，但在后两局比赛中发挥失常，以１６∶１８，２∶１５负于奥尔松／本特松。接着出场的杨阳、韩爱平、李永波／田秉毅均以２∶０战胜对手。在最后进行的女双比赛中，孙小青／周雷以２∶１险胜卡·本特松／玛·本特松。
    印尼队以５∶０轻取英格兰队，未失一局。
    今天进行的其它６个级别的比赛结果是：Ｂ级，马来西亚队以３∶２胜日本队；Ｃ级，中国台北队以３∶２胜加拿大队，泰国队以４∶１胜香港队；Ｄ级，澳大利亚队以３∶２胜波兰队，苏格兰队以３∶２胜联邦德国队；Ｅ级，芬兰队以５∶０胜美国队，新西兰队以５∶０胜奥地利队；Ｆ级，挪威队以５∶０胜尼泊尔队；Ｇ级，保加利亚队以５∶０胜毛里求斯队，荷兰队以３∶２胜苏联队。
    雅加达地处赤道附近，气候闷热，据韩爱平讲，中国选手虽到达这里已４天，但至今未能适应这里的气候。印尼队为了不让苏迪曼杯“出国”，改装了体育馆的灯光设备，在此已训练几月。熊国宝对记者说，光线太强，我们还不适应，而且强烈的灯光又增加了馆内气温，这使本来就怕高温的欧洲等国选手更感不适。
    据组委会负责人透露，原报名参加苏迪曼杯赛的３０支球队中，印度队和巴基斯坦队已弃权。明晚中国队将迎战丹麦队。
