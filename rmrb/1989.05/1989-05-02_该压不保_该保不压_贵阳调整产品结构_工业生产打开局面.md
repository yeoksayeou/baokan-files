Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, May 2nd. (Reporter He Tianwen) Facing difficulties with limited funds, energy, and raw materials, Guiyang City has since the beginning of the year vigorously adjusted its product structure, taking more than 50 key enterprises and 40 marketable products as the focus of development, and industrial production has begun to break through.

Since the end of last year, industrial enterprises in Guiyang City have generally faced tight funds and raw materials. To make the limited funds and raw materials produce better economic benefits, Guiyang City, adhering to the principle of "to cut back on what should be cut, to protect what should be protected," has, with the goal of increasing social effective supply, conducted investigations and analyses on more than 200 industrial enterprises in the city. Enterprises producing agricultural support products, daily necessities, and marketable light textile products have been listed as key development areas. The city decided to use 90% of the city's circulating funds to support these key enterprises and products, and at the same time, provide matching and priority supplies in terms of energy, raw materials, and other aspects, enabling a batch of enterprises to seek life in tight situations and walk out of the "narrow valley" of production.

It is reported that in the first quarter of this year, Guiyang City's industrial output value increased by 11% compared to the same period last year. Currently, industrial production in the entire city continues to maintain a growth momentum. Guiyang City, based on reality, has helped enterprises that are struggling to continue production due to unmarketable products, within its capacity, to adjust their product structure, strengthen enterprise management, and provide appropriate support in terms of funds, so that they can get through the difficulties.

　　该压不保　该保不压   
    贵阳调整产品结构     
    工业生产打开局面
    新华社贵阳５月２日电  （记者何天文）面对资金、能源和原材料紧缺的困难，贵阳市自年初起大力调整产品结构，以５０多个骨干企业和４０种适销产品作为发展重点，工业生产开始打开局面。
    去年年底以来，贵阳市的工业企业普遍出现资金、原材料紧张。为了使有限的资金、原材料产生更好的经济效益，贵阳市本着“该压不保，该保不压”的原则，以增加社会有效供给为目的，对全市２００多个工业企业进行了调查分析，把生产支农产品、人民生活必需品以及适销对路的轻纺产品的企业，列为发展重点。市里决定把全市９０％的流动资金用于扶持这些重点企业及产品的生产，同时在能源、原材料等方面给予配套和优先供应，使一批企业紧中求活，走出生产“狭谷”。　
  据介绍，今年一季度贵阳市工业产值比去年同期增长11％，目前，全市工业生产继续保持增长势头。贵阳市还从实际出发，对因产品不对路而生产难以为继的企业，在力所能及的范围内帮助他们调整产品结构，加强企业管理，在资金上适当给予支持，以使它们度过难关。
