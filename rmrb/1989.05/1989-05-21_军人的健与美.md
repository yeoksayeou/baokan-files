In the early May evening, the auditorium of the Lanzhou Military Region was filled with lively and cheerful melodies. Over 140 male and female aerobics team members from 7 representative teams performed enthusiastically. With the music, they moved their feet, stretched their arms, and turned their heads. The full extension, powerful contraction, flexible rotation, and novel movements created beautiful shapes, bringing the audience into a realm of beauty.

The 7 representative teams participating in the military region's aerobics competition all came from grassroots units. Among them, there were communication soldiers who had been guarding lines in deep mountains and valleys for years, white-clad angels who cared for the wounded and sick, and olive-green-clad armed police officers, air force female soldiers, and military industrial workers. When choreographing their aerobics routines, each team incorporated their professional characteristics creatively. The female aerobics team from the military region's air force hospital, dressed in flight suits, performed the "Eaglets Soaring" aerobics routine. The movements included the flight actions of airplanes, with scenes of takeoff, landing, formation flying, and gliding. The team formations were varied and dynamic, combining the feminine grace with the masculine vigor of soldiers, giving the audience a fresh and exciting experience. The female aerobics team from the military region's medical school, dressed in tight-fitting green military uniforms, incorporated emergency assembly, grenade throwing, shooting, and drill movements into their aerobics routine, achieving an unexpected artistic effect. The male aerobics team from the guard battalion combined grappling and fighting with aerobics, presenting a unique style.

In the remote deserts and highlands of the Great Northwest, why is aerobics so popular in the military camps? Regarding this question, the author interviewed the organizers of this competition. They believe that aerobics is a high-level cultural activity that combines sports, art, and education. It can train posture, enrich cultural life, and meet the diverse needs of different people. Aerobics aims for beauty, aligning with human's love for beauty, thus gaining the favor of young soldiers. There is an even more important reason: the reform and opening up have brought significant changes to the military personnel's thoughts and spirits. They not only pursue beauty but also like to express it through their actions, making their healthy and beautiful images stand out. Moreover, young soldiers in the military have a strong sense of collective honor, and group aerobics emphasize unity, which perfectly matches the characteristics of the military.

　　军人的健与美
    杨战宏
    ５月初的一个夜晚，兰州军区礼堂回荡着轻松明快的旋律，７个代表队的１４０多名男女健美队员竞相献艺。随着音乐投足、伸臂、摆头。那充分的伸展，有力的收缩，灵活自如的转动，新颖别致的动作，这些优美的造型把观众带进了一个美的境界之中。
    参加军区健美操比赛的７个代表队均来自基层部队。他们当中，既有长年在深山峡谷守护线路的通信兵战士，也有守护伤病员的白衣天使，还有身穿橄榄绿的武警官兵、空军女战士和军工姐妹。各队在编排健美操时，都结合本职工作，巧妙地把各自的专业特点创造性地编排进健美操里，军区空军医院女子健美队身着飞行服，他们表演的《雏鹰展翅》健美操，在动作的编排上，融进了飞机的飞翔动作，场面调度结合了飞机起飞、降落、编队、滑翔，队型动作变幻多姿，既有女子的阴柔之美，又不乏军人的阳刚之气，给人耳目一新之感。军区卫生学校女子健美队，身穿草绿色紧身军装演出服，把女战士紧急集合投弹、射击以及队列动作揉进健美操里，达到了出人意料的艺术效果。警卫营男子健美队把擒拿格斗同健美操融为一体，表演别具风格。
    在大西北遥远的戈壁、高原边防的一座座军营里，健美操何以受青睐？就这个问题，笔者采访了这次大赛的组织者。他们认为，健美操运动属于高层次的文化范畴，它具有横跨体育、艺术和教育的综合特质，既能进行姿态训练，又能丰富文化生活，以多元的内容满足不同人的需求。健美操是以健美为目标，符合人类爱美之心，因此受到部队青年的欢迎。还有一个更重要的原因，那就是改革开放给军队干部战士在思想观念和精神面貌上带来的明显变化，他们不仅追求美，而且喜欢用自己的行动表现美，使自己健康优美的形象能够引人注目。再则，部队青年集体荣誉感强，而集体健美操整体感又强，正好符合部队的特点。
