International Outlook

The dispute between West Germany and the United States over the modernization of short-range missiles has caused deep rifts within the NATO alliance.

On the surface, the differences between the two countries do not seem severe. West Germany has proposed delaying the study of short-range missile modernization until 1992, while the United States insists on proceeding now. West Germany's reasoning is that NATO's short-range missiles are all deployed in West Germany. Given the current easing of East-West relations, the German people oppose the continued deployment of such tactical nuclear weapons, let alone increasing their lethality and range. Considering that the West German Federal Parliament will hold elections next year, the Kohl government does not want to risk losing votes by supporting the U.S. plan to modernize short-range missiles. The United States, however, argues that the Soviet Union still maintains an advantage in conventional arms in Europe, and that after the destruction of intermediate-range missiles by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, maintaining nuclear deterrence against the Soviet Union necessitates the modernization of short-range missiles. However, on this point, West Germany and the United States do not seem to be in conflict. Kohl has stated in the West German Parliament that he "opposes the complete elimination of tactical nuclear weapons under the current balance of military forces in Europe."

So, is the disagreement between West Germany and the United States over short-range missile modernization merely a matter of doing it a few years earlier or later? It seems not.

Kohl stated at the end of last month in the West German Federal Parliament that the European Community's unified internal market will be established by 1992, and that Europe is "entering a new era," with the first opportunity since the end of World War II to "escape the shadow of East-West conflict." He believes that the new policies of the Soviet Union "bring new broad opportunities and prospects for shaping future East-West relations," and expresses the West German government's determination to "cooperate with the Soviet Union" and to "shape our bilateral relations" and the "prospects for European peace and security" in the long term. Although the statement does not mention the issue of short-range missiles, it actually reveals the background of West Germany's stance.

What the United States is concerned about is precisely West Germany's new Eastern policy, and West Germany's attitude has already been endorsed by more than half of the NATO countries, including Belgium. If this continues, by 1992, the partnership between the United States and Western Europe, maintained by NATO, will be replaced by a competitive relationship between the European unified market and the U.S.-Canada free trade alliance. Moreover, that year is also a U.S. election year; a NATO alliance riddled with cracks and a policy towards the Soviet Union that lacks Western European support would be highly detrimental to Bush's re-election. Therefore, the United States, in alliance with Britain, has exerted considerable pressure on West Germany. However, West Germany, it seems, is still "unwilling to play the role of a submissive follower" and obey Washington.

What the future holds remains to be seen at the NATO summit to be held in Brussels on the 29th of this month, where the relevant parties may be able to reach a compromise that saves face for everyone. However, even if a compromise is reached, the cracks, once formed, will not be so easy to erase.

　　北约的裂痕
    塞北
    西德同美国在短程导弹现代化问题上的争论，在北约集团内部引起了深刻的裂痕。
    表面看来，两国之间分歧并不严重。西德要求把短导现代化问题推迟到１９９２年再研究，美国则主张现在就进行。西德的理由是北约的短导现在都部署在西德，在目前东西关系趋于缓和的形势下，西德人民反对继续部署这种战术核武器，更不用说增加它们的杀伤力和射程了。鉴于明年西德联邦议院将举行选举，科尔政府不愿因支持美国的短导现代化计划而冒失去选票的危险。美国则认为苏联在欧洲仍然在常规军备上具有优势，在美苏销毁中程导弹以后，要保持对苏联的核威慑，短导的现代化势在必行。但是在这一点上西德与美国似乎又不矛盾。科尔在西德议会中说过，他“反对在目前欧洲军事力量对比的情况下彻底消除战术核武器”。
    那末，西德同美国在短导现代化上的分歧仅仅是早几年还是晚几年的问题吗？看来不尽然。
    科尔上月底在西德联邦议院发表政府声明说，欧洲共同体的统一内部市场将在１９９２年建成，欧洲“开始进入一个新时代”，“从二次大战结束以来第一次出现了我们能够摆脱东西方冲突阴影的机会”。他认为苏联的新政策“为将来塑造东西方关系带来了新的广泛的机会和前景”，表示西德政府决心“与苏联进行合作”，长期地“塑造我们的双边关系”和“欧洲和平与安全的前景”。声明虽对短程导弹问题一字不提，但实际上把西德态度的背景和盘托出了。
    美国所担心的，正是西德的这种新东方政策，而西德的态度已经得到了比利时等一大半北约国家的赞同。照此下去，到１９９２年，由北约维系的美国西欧的伙伴关系，将被欧洲统一市场同美国加拿大自由贸易联盟的竞争关系所取代。而这一年又是美国的大选年；一个布满裂痕的北约集团，一个得不到西欧支持的对苏政策，将对布什竞选连任极为不利。因此美国联合英国，对西德施加了很大的压力，但是西德至今看来仍然“不想再扮演唯唯诺诺的角色”而听命于华盛顿。
    前途如何，且看本月２９日在布鲁塞尔举行的北约首脑会议上有关各方能否达成一个保全大家面子的妥协方案。但是即使作出妥协，裂痕既已存在，要使它消失就不那末容易了。
