Joint Ventures for Railway Construction Are an Effective Approach

Urumqi Railway Bureau, Zhang Zhengqing

For a long time, railway construction in China has been entirely managed by the state. In fact, many countries around the world have adopted joint venture forms for railway construction, and even in old China, joint ventures for railway construction were not uncommon. It was only after the reform and opening up that we began to experiment with joint ventures.

The western section of the Lanxin Railway, specifically the Urumqi to Alashankou segment under our bureau, is a successful example of joint venture railway construction. This segment is 460 kilometers long, with the first phase of the project reaching Wusu, a distance of 336 kilometers. It was jointly constructed by the state, the Ministry of Railways, and the autonomous region. The project was completed on schedule, not only achieving high speed but also significantly saving investment. The construction cost per kilometer for this segment is only 1.28 million yuan, which is quite rare nationwide.

In the current situation where both national and local financial resources are tight, we should accelerate the pace of introducing foreign capital. National investment should primarily take the form of loans, with a focus on strengthening macro-control and supervision, and further leveraging the enthusiasm of local governments.

　　合资建路是条有效途径
    乌鲁木齐铁路局  张正清
    长期以来，我国铁路一直由国家大包大揽。事实上，世界上许多国家在铁路建设中都采用了合资形式，旧中国合资建路也不乏见。改革开放后，我们才在合资上进行了一些尝试。
    我局兰新铁路西段乌鲁木齐——阿拉山口段就是合资建路的成功典型。该段全长４６０公里，第一期工程到乌苏３３６公里，由国家、铁道部和自治区合资修建。工程按计划完成，不仅速度快，而且大大节省了投资。该段铁路每公里造价仅１２８万元，在全国都是少有的。
    在当前国家和地方财力都比较紧张的情况下，应加快引进外资的步伐；国家投资则应以贷款形式为主，加强宏观调控和监督，并进一步发挥地方的积极性。
