Visitors to Guixi County in Jiangxi Province never fail to visit Longhushan. Perhaps it is because Zhang Daoling, a sage of the Eastern Han Dynasty, was the first to recognize the beauty of the mountains and waters here and chose this place to refine elixirs and establish Taoism. Or perhaps it is because Shui Hu Zhuan, written by Shi Nai'an, describes this place in its opening chapter as having "thousands of peaks vying for beauty, and ten thousand valleys competing in flow. Waterfalls fly diagonally, and vines hang upside down," with "green jade dyeing thousands of pieces of jade, and blue silk covering ten thousand piles of smoke." Either way, these historical connections are enough to attract people.

Longhushan has 108 peaks, big and small. The mountains are not very high, but they are peculiar with strange rocks in various shapes. The trees are lush, and there are also sheer cliffs with sparse grass. Among these mountains, the 300-mile-long Lushui River is pure and clear, crystal clear, like a jade dragon lying among the emeralds. Sitting on a bamboo raft and drifting down the river, you can see the clear water at the bottom, with small fish swimming around, and occasionally a few wild ducks swimming leisurely. Looking at the mountains on both sides from the raft, it is like a series of moving landscapes passing by. Each peak has its unique shape, and the local people have imagined them as common items in daily life and created various legends and stories. Among them, the "Ten Things You Can't Do" scenic spots are particularly amusing. For example, "You can't use the rice bowl": there is a concave wall on the cliff that looks like a rice bowl, several people high, and from a distance, it looks like a bowl used by people in the south to hold rice. It is said that Zhang Tianzhu dropped a bowl here while refining elixirs on the mountain. But who can use such a "rice bowl" to hold rice! There are also "You can't comb your hair with the comb," "You can't wear the cloud cloth," "You can't eat the immortal peaches," and so on. Each scenic spot, when introduced by the raft guide, makes you look more and more like it, and you can't help but smile with understanding. You can't help but admire the rich imagination and clever metaphors of the folk.

When the bamboo raft passes by a few steep cliffs, we can look up and see many large and small caves on the cliff face, several tens of meters above the river. There are coffins, urns, and wooden fences inside the caves. The mountains are steep, with no way to go down or up, so how did the coffins get buried in the cliffs? A few years ago, archaeologists from Jiangxi Province asked local herbalists to explore. They tied ropes around their waists, suspended themselves from the top of the mountain, and then swung into the caves along the steep cliffs. They found many coffins inside the caves, which are cliff tombs. It is estimated that these coffins are over 2,500 years old. Most of them are single-wood coffins made of whole nanmu wood, split in half, then hollowed out, and the body is placed inside. How did such heavy coffins get into the caves on the sheer cliffs? While enjoying the scenery of "the river like a green silk belt and the mountains like a jade hairpin," pondering this mystery that is still unsolved today is also an interesting thing to do.

Sometimes the bamboo raft will go down rapidly with the water flow, making a rumbling sound, which is surprising but safe; sometimes it will turn a big bend with the rapid water flow, making you lean but not fall. Watching the bamboo raft drift in the green mountains and clear waters, it is like being in a moving painting, making one's mind expansive and thoughts soar.

Longhushan was opened as a tourist attraction not long ago. Therefore, there are not many tourists, which is good, as it keeps this place more natural and rustic, without the artificiality and makeup of a city girl, like a beautiful country girl, whose simple beauty is dazzling.

The famous statesman of the Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi, wrote a seven-character quatrain titled "Visiting Longhushan": "A bay of moss leads to green pines, blue stones rise with the evening wind. The sound of bells echoes in the clouds, the sound of the lute resonates in the water." It captures the tranquil and ethereal beauty of this place. Visiting Longhushan is a release from the noise and chaos, like experiencing a storm and then coming to a quiet village after the rain, full of freshness and vitality, making you sincerely appreciate the beauty of nature that has not been polluted!

    龙虎山水
    赵相如
    到了江西贵溪县没有不去龙虎山的，也许是因为东汉年代那个张道陵独具慧眼看中这儿的美山秀水而在此炼丹创建道教之故吧，也许是因为施耐庵在《水浒》的开篇中把这儿描绘成“千峰竞秀，万壑争流。瀑布斜飞，藤萝倒挂”，“青黛染成千块玉，碧纱笼罩万堆烟”之故吧，反正有这两则历史因缘，也足够吸引人的了。
    龙虎山大大小小有108个山头。山并不高，却是奇峦怪石，形态各异，树木葱茏，也有千仞绝壁，绿草依稀。在这群山之中，一条长300里的泸溪河纯清冰洁、晶莹透明，仿佛银玉横卧于翡翠丛中。坐在竹筏上顺水而下，清澈见底的水里，细鱼历历可数，不时有几只野鸭款款游弋。坐在竹筏上远看近望两边的山头，真好比一幅幅动人景象迎面闪过。各个山头有其独具的形状，当地群众为之联想成了生活中的常见物品，并且编成了各种传说和故事，其中有“十个不得”的景点特别逗人发乐。比如“饭勺用不得”：山壁上仿佛一个饭勺形状的凹壁，有几个人高，远看就像南方人盛饭用的勺子，传说是张天师在山上炼丹要用勺，不小心丢了一个在这里。但是谁能用这么个“饭勺”去盛饭呢！还有“梳子梳不得”、“云间布披不得”、“仙女仙桃吃不得”等等，每个景点经撑筏人一介绍，就令人越看越觉得像，情不自禁地发出会心的微笑。不能不为民间丰富想象和巧妙比喻的才智而折服。当竹筏沿河行驶到几处陡壁时，我们仰头可以望到在离河面几十米高的壁面，有不少大大小小的洞穴，洞穴里有棺木，有坛罐，还有木板栅栏之类。山势峻峭，无路可下也无路可上，这些棺木是怎么葬进崖壁里去的呢？几年前，江西省的考古工作者请了当地的药农去探险，用麻绳缠在腰上，从山顶往下悬吊，然后沿着峭壁再荡入洞中，发现洞内有许多棺木，是崖墓群。据测定，这些棺木距今有2500多年历史。大都是独木棺，采用整块楠木料，一剖为二，然后空瓤，把尸体放进去。那么沉重的棺木是怎么送进这绝壁的洞穴中去的呢？在让你观赏这“江作青罗带，山如碧玉簪”的风光时，思索一番这一个至今仍难解开的奇迹的谜，也是颇有意思的事。
    竹筏有时会随着水势陡然而下，发出轰轰声，让人惊而无险；有时又顺着湍急水流转个大弯，叫人侧而不倒；看着竹筏在青山绿水间飘忽，真好比在流动的画图中一样地心旷神怡，幽思飞扬。
    龙虎山开辟为旅游景点，还是不久前的事。所以来的游客不是很多，这倒也好，使这个地方更保持了朴实的山野的本色，没有那种雕琢的粉黛的脂粉气，像一个俊秀的山野村姑，那种朴素的俏美令人眩目。
    宋代名相王安石曾有《游龙虎山》七绝一首：“一湾苔轻引青松，苍石增高进晚风。方响乱敲云影里，琵琶高映水声中。”写出了这儿山水恬淡超逸的情致。游龙虎山水，是对喧嚣繁杂的解脱，仿佛经历了暴风骤雨后来到雨过天晴的山村，一片清新宁静的生机，使你觉得充满了勃发的活力，会由衷赞叹没有经过污染的大自然的美妙！
