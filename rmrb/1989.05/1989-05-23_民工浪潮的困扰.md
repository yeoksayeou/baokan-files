Currently, large and medium-sized cities such as Guangzhou, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have seen a surge of migrant workers, and our district is no exception. A large number of migrant workers have flocked to the cities, bringing numerous social security issues. Statistics show that last year, 14% of the major criminal cases solved in our district were committed by outsiders, 16% of the major criminals came from other provinces, and 14 people were sentenced. The reasons are as follows:

First, unstable residence and difficult management. Migrant workers often move to where the income is higher, frequently changing locations every 10 days or half a month, making their movements highly mobile. Their living places are mostly on construction sites, with a few renting civilian homes, making it difficult for relevant departments to manage and timely discover and crack down on crimes. Lu Huayu from Fuyang County, Anhui, worked in four different places in two months. On August 2, 1988, he robbed, raped, and killed a 54-year-old mentally ill woman in the water pump room of Xiaogang Village, Xian'ao Township, and then returned to the construction site at Dongmen, Chengguan. On the early morning of August 7, Lu attempted to rob and rape a pregnant woman at the construction site in Xiyuan, Chengguan, and then fled to another construction site to hide. He was later caught.

Second, some employers only care about the low cost of migrant labor and do not manage them properly, with some not even knowing the basic information of the workers such as their names, ages, and hometowns. In August 1988, Li Xiaoming and Zhang Ping from Nanling County, Anhui, came to Dinghai and worked in a township construction team. After three months, they stole a color TV from the landlord of the construction team's dormitory.

Third, there is a lack of effective management methods. The large-scale movement of migrant workers is a recent phenomenon in China, and the public security departments have not yet come up with practical security management measures. The grassroots public security organs are burdened with heavy security tasks and lack manpower, making it difficult to effectively manage the large number of mobile migrant workers.

It is hoped that relevant departments will organize public security, labor, commerce, construction, and family planning departments to form a special management team. Migrant workers should be required to obtain certificates from their hometowns for work and residence. Any unit or individual should hire migrant workers with relevant certificates and be responsible for their daily management.

　　民工浪潮的困扰
    目前，广州、北京、上海、杭州等大中城市先后涌入了大量民工，我区也不例外。大批民工纷纷进城，给城市的社会治安带来了不少问题。据统计，去年我区查破的重大刑事案件有１４％系外来人员所为，１６％的重大案犯来自于外省市，有１４人被判刑。究其原因：
    一、居所不定，管理困难。外来民工往往是哪里收入多就涌向哪里，常常１０天、半月换一个地方，游动频繁。他们的住处大多在建筑工地，少量的租住民房，使有关部门难于管理，不能及时发现、打击犯罪。来自安徽阜阳县的骆华幼，两个月间先后务工４处。去年８月２日晚，他在我区详岙乡小矸村抽水机房抢劫、强奸、杀死一５４岁女精神病人后，即回到城关东门某建筑工地。８月７日凌晨，骆在这一工地抢劫、强奸一孕妇未遂，便跑到城关西园某建筑工地躲藏。后被抓获。
    二、有些雇工单位只图外来劳力低廉，不抓日常管理，有的甚至连民工的姓名、年龄、原籍地址等基本情况也不了解。去年８月，安徽南陵县李晓明、张平等人流入定海，在一个乡工程队干活，３个月后盗走了工程队房东家的一台彩电。
    三、缺少有效的管理办法。民工大流动是我国近年来出现的，公安部门一时拿不出切实可行的治安管理办法，基层公安机关苦于治安工作任务繁重，警力严重不足，无法有效地管理游动不定的、众多的外来民工。
    呼吁有关部门组织公安、劳动、工商、建筑、计划生育等部门，成立专门管理班子，规定外来民工一律凭原籍有关部门发给的身份、生育等证件，办理务工、居住等手续。任何单位或个人应凭有关证件雇佣民工，并负责日常管理工作。
