On the basis of recommendations from local children's publishers, after evaluation by the National Red Scarf Reading and Newspaper Award Committee, the Ministry of Education, the Communist Youth League Central Committee, the Ministry of Culture, and the State Press and Publication Administration jointly recommended 80 children's books, including "For Youth Seeking Ideals," "100 Questions for Primary School Students," and "How I Study," on the occasion of the "June 1" Children's Day.

The four departments require local youth league, education, culture, and publishing departments to work together and do a good job in promoting and distributing the recommended books based on local conditions. The Ministry of Education has allocated 300,000 yuan to supplement the funds of some primary schools that are short of books.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 30th.

The Ministry of Education, in collaboration with the Ministry of Culture, the State Sports Commission, the China Association for Science and Technology, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Communist Youth League Central Committee, has drafted the "Opinions on Free or Discounted Access to Various Cultural Facilities for Primary and Secondary School Students Nationwide."

The "Opinions" propose that museums, memorial halls, science and technology museums, cultural centers, sports stadiums (gyms), cinemas, and other public cultural facilities, as well as auditoriums and cultural and sports facilities belonging to state organs, the military, enterprises, institutions, and social organizations, should open free of charge to primary and secondary school students once or twice a year. The opening time should preferably be arranged during national holidays (such as "June 1," "October 1," or winter and summer vacations). Museums, memorial halls, and exhibition halls should, according to the needs of primary and secondary school education and teaching, provide free or low-cost services for group visits. Commercial cultural facilities, such as sports stadiums (gyms), amusement parks, cinemas, and auditoriums, should hold special events for primary and secondary school students during winter and summer vacations, providing low-cost or free services. This year, various units' exhibitions celebrating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation should provide free access for primary and secondary school students to visit in groups.
