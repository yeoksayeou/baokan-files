In Dingzhou City, Hebei Province, Tem Gai Ping is quite famous. During the interview, when the reporter asked the staff of the municipal committee, the service staff of the guesthouse, and the individual vendors on the street, few of them did not know who Tem Gai Ping was.

Who is Tem Gai Ping? A sports star, a popular singer, or a successful entrepreneur? None of the above. She is just an illiterate rural woman from Lingbei Village, Mingyue Shop Township, Dingzhou City, Hebei Province. The reason she is famous in Dingzhou is that within less than two years, she used bribery and fraud to buy off 20 state officials from the public security, court, industry and commerce, and agricultural bank departments in Dingzhou City, embezzling funds from 24 units in three provinces, two cities, and three counties totaling over 75 million yuan, leading to 22 people being caught in the net.

Money: Tem Gai Ping's Weapon of Attack

Tem Gai Ping, standing at 1.48 meters, is thin and frail, with a shaggy haircut covering a wrinkled, dark face. When she speaks, she spits everywhere. She is almost illiterate and cannot write Arabic numerals or even her own name. The interrogation records in the detention center are first signed by others on her behalf, and then she stamps her fingerprint.

It is this woman, who has neither good looks nor education, who consecutively bought off Dingzhou City's Public Security Bureau Deputy Director Jia Zhanchen, Dingzhou City Commercial Inspection Bureau Economic Inspection Section Deputy Director Wang Heying, China Agricultural Bank Dingzhou City Branch Mingyue Shop Credit Cooperative Director Cao Deshan, and Mingyue Shop People's Court Deputy Director Zhao Dejin, among 20 state officials. She relied on money.

In the transition between old and new systems and the development of a commodity economy today, the power of law enforcement and financial departments is particularly significant. In Tem Gai Ping's words, "People like these, we can't offend." In fact, in the eyes of people like Tem Gai Ping, officials in law enforcement and financial departments are not just unoffendable; they know these officials have power, and they have long targeted them as their main attack objectives.

The staff of the Dingzhou City People's Procuratorate introduced, "The reason Tem Gai Ping succeeded is that she bought off the functional departments." Tem Gai Ping's important means of buying and using officials is first to pave the way with goods.

The 50-year-old Deputy Director of Mingyue Shop People's Court, Zhao Dejin, did not originally know Tem Gai Ping. One day, he and a court policeman encountered Tem Gai Ping on the street and asked her to buy a color TV. The status of a judge in the countryside is also quite high. Although it was their first meeting, Tem Gai Ping did not hesitate to take on the task of buying the color TV. After the TV was bought, Zhao Dejin was supposed to pay, but Tem Gai Ping insisted on not taking the money: "Oh, we'll talk about it later." So, this judge also said, "We'll talk about it later," and later never mentioned it again.

As the saying goes, "He who takes the hand is soft." In the summer of 1988, without a business license, capital, venue, or supply source, Tem Gai Ping defrauded 660,000 yuan from Hebei Provincial Radio and Television University to buy color TVs. It was Zhao Dejin who exceeded his authority, stamping the court seal on Tem Gai Ping's fake deposit slips and color TV purchase agreements and contracts six times, giving the green light to her fraud.

In September 1988, the color TVs Tem Gai Ping was reselling were seized by the Dingzhou City Industry and Commerce Bureau. She used her connections to find Dingzhou City Public Security Bureau Deputy Director Jia Zhanchen, giving him money and goods to plead her case. Jia Zhanchen and his wife, along with three officials from the Dingzhou City Industry and Commerce Bureau and Public Security Bureau, received 7 color TVs and 11,000 yuan. Tem Gai Ping's case of reselling color TVs was handled entirely at Jia's residence.

Indifference: Officials' Resistance to Corruption

When officials in financial and law enforcement departments have become targets of economic criminals' attacks and use, some of them have a weak resistance to corruption. This is one of the important factors that allowed Tem Gai Ping to carry out her economic criminal activities unobstructed.

Since 1987, Yu Jianxia, a 27-year-old accountant at the Agricultural Bank of China's Mingyue Shop Credit Cooperative, used providing statements, forging deposit slips, and embezzling funds to provide Tem Gai Ping with 21.8 million yuan. During this period, Yu Jianxia extorted and accepted 770,000 yuan in bribes.

Tem Gai Ping asked Yu Jianxia to provide funds and promised her benefits. Yu Jianxia saw this as "partnering in business." She said in her confession: "Now, everyone else is getting rich, what method should I use to get rich? Tem Gai Ping found me, and it's time for me to make some extra money." "Suddenly, I got tens of thousands of yuan, I was scared, happy, and surprised! Should I take it? It's too much; should I not take it? I can't bear to. Later, when Tem Gai Ping got into trouble, I wanted to return some of the money to her, but I couldn't find her."

Yu Jianxia's confession revealed the common mindset of the 20 state officials bought by Tem Gai Ping. Under the strong drive of greed for money, some officials lost their rationality, disregarded laws and regulations, and used their power to engage in the exchange of money and power.

Tem Gai Ping understood the officials' psychology. When she went to the Mingyue Shop Credit Cooperative to handle matters, she was always happy to invite the director, accountant, cashier, and other staff to drink and eat. The officials at the credit cooperative? They would attend without fail. After becoming familiar, Tem Gai Ping further helped them buy cheap color TVs, refrigerators, bicycles, and other scarce goods. When they wanted to pay, her catchphrase "We'll talk about it later" repeatedly captivated many greedy officials.

Some officials' desires swelled, seeing that Tem Gai Ping was profitable, they became even bolder, from accepting bribes to demanding them. The cashier at the Agricultural Bank of China's Mingyue Shop Branch, Yang Jianzhang, said after being arrested: "Later, when Tem Gai Ping came to handle matters, everyone rushed to serve her because Tem Gai Ping would not shortchange us after handling matters."

When the reporter interviewed the relevant criminals in the detention center, they generally reflected that initially, Tem Gai Ping's treating them to meals, buying them cheap goods, were all seen as normal, just getting some benefits, without realizing they were being corrupted. Yang Jianzhang said: "Only now do I realize that Tem Gai Ping was using her money to buy the power of officials, using the power of officials to make more money for her."

Prescription: Public Administration and Supervision

How to prevent and eliminate the problems exposed by Tem Gai Ping's bribery and fraud case? Zhang Ying, Deputy Secretary of the Dingzhou City Party Committee, said in an interview with the reporter: "In addition to strengthening the anti-corruption education for the majority of cadres, the key is to rely on the openness and supervision of public administration."

For example, loans should clearly stipulate the examination of the applicant's account, free capital ratio, operating fixed venue, and other conditions. Even if some staff engage in favoritism, if the relevant departments timely supervise and inspect the implementation of the regulations, the misdeeds of people like Tem Gai Ping will be exposed early.

Wang Wenjin, Director of the Agricultural Bank of China's Dingzhou City Branch, said they have decided that the loan department will henceforth publicly announce the loan amount, purpose, unit (individual), examiner, approver, loan period, and loan interest rate, to facilitate public supervision.

Ying Congzhi, Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, analyzed Tem Gai Ping's case: "Tem Gai Ping used money to buy the power of Communist Party cadres, and then used the power of Communist Party cadres to make more money. This is a lesson for all cadres to be vigilant."

The Tem Gai Ping case once again shows that if our cadres, especially those with various powers, disregard party discipline and state laws and engage in shameful exchanges of money and power, they will inevitably become disgraceful prisoners.

　　目不识丁的农村妇女温改平买通２０名国家工作人员，  两年盗用三省二市三县资金７５０余万元，且看这——
    钱与权的交易
    郑宏范
    在河北省定州市，温改平的知名度颇高。记者在采访中，曾有意向市委机关干部、下榻招待所的服务员，以及街头摆摊的个体户寻问，他们中不知晓温改平其人其事的寥寥无几。
    温改平何许人也？体育新秀，走红歌星，还是致富能手？都不是。她不过是河北省定州市明月店乡陵北村一个目不识丁的农村妇女。她之所以名播定州，是因她在不到两年的时间里以行贿、诈骗为手段，买通了定州市公安、法院、工商、农行等单位的２０名国家工作人员，盗用三省、两市、三县２４个单位资金７５０余万元，致使２２人落入法网。
  金钱：温改平的进攻武器
    １．４８米的温改平瘦小单薄，披落到肩的剪发掩着一张枯黄的枣核脸，说起话来唾沫四溅。她是一个准文盲，阿拉伯数字及她自己的名字一概不会写。在看守所的审讯记录也是先由别人代她签字，再由她自己按个手印。
    就是这么一个既无容貌，又无文化的农村妇女，却接连买通了定州市公安局副局长贾占辰、定州市商检局经检股副股长王合营、中国农业银行定州市支行明月店信用社主任曹德善、明月店人民法庭副庭长赵德进等２０名国家工作人员，她所凭借的就是金钱。
    新旧体制交替、发展商品经济的今天，执法部门、金融部门的权力显得尤其重大。用温改平的话说，就是“这样的人咱得罪不起”。其实，在温改平这类人的眼里，执法、金融部门的人员岂止是得罪不起，他们深知这些干部手中有权，而且早就把这些人作为自己的主攻目标了。
    定州市人民检察院的干警介绍说：“温改平之所以得逞，关键是把职能部门买通了。”温改平收买、利用干部的重要手段先是以物铺路。
    ５０岁的明月店人民法庭副庭长赵德进原先并不认识温改平。一天，他和一名法警与温邂逅街头，向温提出购买彩电。法官在乡里的地位也是显赫的，尽管是初次相识，温改平却毫不犹豫地把买彩电的事情揽了下来。彩电买到后，赵德进本要给钱，温改平却执意不收：“唉，下来再说吧。”于是，这位法官也就“下来再说”，事后却是再也没说了。
    俗话说，拿人的手软。１９８８年夏，一无营业执照，二无资金，三无场地，四无供货来源的温改平在骗取河北省广播电视大学６６万元购买彩电款时，正是赵德进超越职权，先后６次为温改平的假存款单及购买彩电协议、合同加盖法庭公章，为温诈骗开绿灯。
    １９８８年９月，温改平倒卖的彩电被定州市工商局查扣。她利用关系找到定州市公安局副局长贾占辰门下，给钱给物，求其说情。贾占辰夫妇及办案的定州市工商局、公安局３名干部共收受彩电７台，人民币１１０００元。温倒卖彩电一案始终是在贾宅进行的。
  淡薄：干部的拒腐蚀意识
    当金融、执法部门的工作人员已成为经济犯罪分子进攻和利用目标时，他们中确有一些人拒腐蚀意识淡薄。这是温改平进行经济犯罪活动得以畅行无阻的重要因素之一。
    定州市农行明月店信用社会计、２７岁的由建霞自１９８７年起利用提供帐单、伪造存单、偷支截留等手段，为温改平提供资金２１８万元。其间，由建霞索贿、受贿７．７万元。
    温改平让由建霞提供资金，并答应给她好处。由建霞则把这看成是“合伙做买卖”。她在供词中说：“现在，其他人都富了，我用什么方法富呢？温改平找我，可该我找点外快了。”“一下子得了好几万，又害怕，又高兴，又惊讶！要吧，太多；不要吧，又舍不得。后来温改平出事了，想退给她几万，可又找不到她了。”
    由建霞的供词道出了被温改平买通的２０名国家工作人员的普遍心态。在强烈的金钱欲的驱使下，一些干部丧失理性，无视法纪，用手中的权力，做起了钱与权的交易。
    温改平摸透了干部的心理，她到明月店信用社办事，总乐于请主任、会计、出纳等工作人员喝酒、吃饭。信用社的干部呢？则有请必到，熟识之后，温改平进而帮人购买便宜的彩电、冰箱、自行车等紧俏商品。对方要付钱时，她的口头禅“下来再说吧”又一次一次地俘虏了许多贪财的干部。
    一些干部私欲膨胀，看到温改平有利可图，更胆大妄为，由受贿发展到索贿。农行明月店办事处现金出纳员杨建章被捕后说：“后来，温改平来办事，人们都抢着给她办，因为温改平办完事后不会亏待我们。”
    记者在看守所采访此案的有关犯罪分子时，他们普遍反映，当初温改平请吃请喝，给买便宜货，都觉得是正常现象，只是得点实惠而已，根本没有意识到是在被人腐蚀。杨建章说：“现在才知道温改平当初是用她的钱买干部手中的权，用干部手中的权为她捞钱”。
  药方：政务公开与监督
    温改平行贿、诈骗案暴露出一些问题如何预防和消除呢？中共定州市委副书记张莹在接受记者采访时说：“除了要加强对广大干部进行廉政教育外，关键还要依靠政务的公开与监督。”
    比如贷款，明文规定要对申贷者的帐户、自由资金比例、经营固定场所等条件进行审查。即使一些工作人员徇私舞弊，如果有关部门对规定的执行情况及时进行监督检查，温改平等人的劣迹也就会早日败露。
    中国农业银行定州市支行行长王文进说，他们已做出决定，贷款部门今后要把贷款额度、贷款用途、贷款单位（个人）、考查人、批准人、贷款期限和贷款利率等内容统统张榜公布，以利于群众监督。
    中共河北省委书记邢崇智对温改平一案的分析是：“温改平是用钱来买共产党干部手中的权，再用共产党干部手中的权来捞更多的钱。这是值得广大干部警惕的。”
    温改平一案再次表明，我们的干部，尤其是手中握有这样那样权力的干部谁要是无视党纪国法，做那些见不得人的钱与权的交易，必然成为可耻的阶下囚。
