Qingdao has recently investigated and punished a case involving some party and government officials, enterprises, institutions, and individuals who illegally demanded and exchanged commodity housing without paying for it. This case involves nearly 50 units and more than 120 people, including over 70 leaders from party and government organs and enterprises, with 3 being municipal-level leaders.

The investigation revealed that these individuals abused their power, using their positions to demand and exchange commodity housing without paying the required fees. This not only violated the principles of fairness and justice but also undermined the credibility of the party and government.

The Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have taken this incident very seriously. They have set up a special investigation team to thoroughly investigate the case and punish those responsible according to law. The investigation team has already collected a large amount of evidence and has identified the main culprits.

The Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government have stressed that such illegal activities will not be tolerated. They have vowed to severely punish those involved and to take effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

The investigation and punishment of this case have received widespread attention and support from the people of Qingdao. They believe that this case will serve as a warning to others and help to maintain social stability and justice.
