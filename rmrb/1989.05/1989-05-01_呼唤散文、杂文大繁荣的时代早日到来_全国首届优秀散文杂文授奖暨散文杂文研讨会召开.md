A group of essayists and miscellaneous prose writers recently gathered in Wuxi to receive the first national awards for outstanding essays and miscellaneous prose from the Chinese Writers Association. They also discussed the creation of essays and miscellaneous prose.

Participants, especially the award-winning writers, celebrated the fruitful results of essay and miscellaneous prose writing in the new era while deeply mourning the recent passing of the great proletarian revolutionary and statesman, Hu Yaobang, a sincere friend of the literary community. Some writers were moved to tears during their speeches. The opening ceremony began with a three-minute silence in memory of Hu Yaobang. The conference unanimously passed a message of condolence to Hu Yaobang's family, expressing deep sorrow for his passing.

Tang Dacheng, Secretary of the Chinese Writers Association Party Group, delivered the opening speech. He noted that this award ceremony is the first of its kind since the founding of the nation and is a significant event in the literary world. It will be recorded in literary history for its extraordinary significance. He said that essay and miscellaneous prose writing in the new era has achieved unprecedented success. However, for many years, due to the "leftist" artistic guidance, essays and miscellaneous prose have not received the attention and status they deserve and have instead been subjected to extremely harsh and unfair criticism and attacks. Some miscellaneous prose writers, who were once criticized, have finally been honored on the award stage today.

Tang Dacheng summarized the encouraging situation of essay writing in the new era, fully affirming the outstanding contributions made by the older generation of writers such as Bing Xin, Xia Yan, Ba Jin, Huangmo, Sun Li, Ke Ling, Xiao Qian, and others to the development of new era essays. He also pointed out the emergence of a large number of middle-aged and young writers, especially female essayists, and the appearance of a new group of essayists, marking the growth and development of the essayist community and pushing essay writing into a new stage.

Tang Dacheng believes that the achievements of miscellaneous prose in the new era are even more outstanding. It is loved by the broad readership for its profound thoughts, concern for the country and the people, clear distinction between love and hate, and criticism of social ills. The miscellaneous prose of a group of writers represented by Shao Yanxiang embodies the awakening of the writer's subject consciousness and the independent personality of Chinese intellectuals, showing the conscience and courage of people's writers. He said that the changes in society and history require miscellaneous prose, and today is still the era of miscellaneous prose.

The award-winning writers and attendees discussed the creation and development of essays and miscellaneous prose with a free and open mindset. They fully affirmed the achievements of essays and miscellaneous prose in the new era while also pointing out their limitations and shortcomings. Ke Ling, Huang Qiuyun, Feng Yingzi, Yan Xiu, Huang Zongying, Ye Zhicheng, Feng Jicai, Qin Wenyu, Shao Yanxiang, Mu Hui, Shu Zhan, and Chen Xiaochuan made speeches at the conference, each with their unique characteristics.

　　呼唤散文、杂文大繁荣的时代早日到来    
    全国首届优秀散文杂文授奖暨散文杂文研讨会召开
    本报讯  记者刘梦岚报道：一批散文家、杂文家，不久前聚集无锡，接受中国作家协会为他们颁发的全国首届优秀散文、杂文奖，同时研讨散文、杂文的创作问题。
    与会同志，特别是获奖作家，在庆贺新时期以来散文、杂文获得丰硕成果的同时，不能不沉痛地怀念刚刚离去的伟大的无产阶级革命家、政治家，文学界最真诚的朋友胡耀邦同志。有的作家在发言时激动得掉下了热泪。开幕式上，大家以沉痛的心情向胡耀邦同志默哀三分钟。大会一致通过了致胡耀邦同志家属的唁电，表达了对胡耀邦同志的深切的悼念之情。
    中国作家协会党组书记唐达成致开幕词。他指出，这次颁奖活动是建国４０年以来的第一次，是文学界的一桩盛事。它将以其不平凡的意义记载于文学史册。他说，新时期以来的散文、杂文创作取得了前所未有的丰收，但是，多年来由于“左”的文艺指导思想，散文、杂文不仅始终没有得到应有的重视，取得应有的地位，反而受到极其苛刻和不公正的指责和批判。一些杂文作家过去只能被推上批判台，今天终于登上了领奖台。
    唐达成概括总结了新时期以来散文创作可喜的状况，充分肯定了冰心、夏衍、巴金以及荒煤、孙犁、柯灵、萧乾等老一辈作家为新时期散文发展所做的突出贡献；同时也指出一大批风格各异的中青年作家尤其是女性散文作家的崭露头角以及新的散文作家群体的出现，标志着散文队伍的发展壮大，并把散文创作推向了一个新的阶段。
    唐达成认为新时期杂文的成就比散文更为突出。它以其思想深邃、忧国忧民、爱憎分明、针砭时弊而受到广大读者的喜爱。以邵燕祥为代表的一批杂文家的杂文，体现了作家主体意识的觉醒和中国知识分子独立的人格力量，显示了人民作家的良心和胆识。他说社会历史的变革需要杂文，今天仍是杂文的时代。
    获奖作家及其出席者，以自由的心态，畅所欲言，热烈而认真地研讨了散文、杂文创作及其发展的问题。大家充分肯定了新时期散文、杂文所取得的成就，同时也指出了它们的局限与不足。柯灵、黄秋耘、冯英子、严秀、黄宗英、叶至诚、冯骥才、秦文玉、邵燕祥、牧惠、舒展、陈小川等在大会上做了各具特色的发言。
