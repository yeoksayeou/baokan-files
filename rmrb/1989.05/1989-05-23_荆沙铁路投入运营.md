The first local railway in Hubei Province—the Jingmen to Shashi Railway—has completed over two years of construction and six months of trial operations and has now officially begun operations.

The Jingsha Railway is connected to the national railway network, starting from Jingmen City on the Jiao-Liu Railway in the north and ending in Shashi City in the south, with a total length of 81 kilometers. In the near term, it will primarily handle freight, with an annual capacity of 2.85 million tons. This local railway will effectively improve the transportation conditions of the Jianghan Plain.
