Fake alcohol, fake seals, fake trademarks—conscientious counterfeiting cheats customers. Cangnan has become a hub for fake trademarks. In Yibin alone, over a million counterfeit items from Cangnan were seized.

	According to a report from the People's Daily, on March 10, the Public Security Bureau and the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureau of Yibin Region in Sichuan collaborated to crack down on a rare nationwide case of counterfeit Wuliangye and Jianzhong brandy trademarks and anti-theft seals. A total of 1,090,000 counterfeit trademarks and seals were seized.

	According to today's issue of the Market News, these counterfeit trademarks, with a production cost of only 200,000 yuan, would have caused consumers a loss of over 3,000,000 yuan if they had entered the market.

	According to the confession of the detained Chen Renlang and others, these counterfeit trademarks and seals were produced in Cangnan County, Zhejiang Province. Last December, Chen Renlang and Wu Qiaoci, criminals from Xianju Township, Xianping Village, Cangnan County, used methods such as mail, freight, and personal carry to transport the counterfeit items in small batches to a farmer's house on the west outskirts of Yibin City. They hid the items in three large oil drums, 13 cardboard boxes, and two large bags, planning to produce counterfeit Wuliangye and Jianzhong brandy in Yibin.

	"Your Yibin is the hometown of famous liquors, and our Cangnan is the hometown of trademarks. Wherever there are famous liquors, there are corresponding trademarks in our place." This is the confession of the criminals from Cangnan County. Since last December, the public security and industrial and commercial departments of Yibin Region have successively cracked down on 16 cases of counterfeit famous liquor trademarks and fake alcohol, seizing over 2,000,000 counterfeit Wuliangye and Jianzhong trademarks, preventing economic losses of hundreds of millions of yuan. The criminals illegally profited from tens of thousands of yuan to over a hundred million yuan. Among the 32 detained criminals, except for 5 locals, the remaining 27 are from Cangnan County.

	It is understood that in Chengdu, Jiangsu, and other places, there are also criminals from Cangnan County. They not only produce counterfeit Wuliangye but also counterfeit Maotai, Luzhou Laojiao, and other famous liquors. The people of Yibin say, "The trouble starts from Cangnan."

　　假酒假盖假商标　昧心造假坑顾客    
    苍南成了假商标之乡 
    仅宜宾一地查获苍南假货百万套
    本报讯  ３月１０日，四川宜宾地区公安处、工商局密切配合，破获一起全国罕见的假冒名酒五粮液、尖庄商标及防盗盖的大案，共收缴假冒商标和防盗盖１０９万多套。
    据今天出版的《市场报》报道，这些假商标，成本仅２０多万元，但若流向社会，将使消费者遭受３００万元以上的巨大损失。
    据已被收审的陈仁朗等人交待，这批假冒商标和防盗盖出自浙江省苍南县。去年底，由苍南县仙居乡仙平村不法分子陈仁朗、吴桥次等人，通过邮寄、托运、携带等手段，化整为零，运到宜宾市西郊一农民住房里，窝藏在３个大汽油桶、１３个硬板纸箱和两大提包内，伺机在宜宾制造假五粮液、假尖庄酒。
    “你们宜宾是名酒之乡，我们苍南是商标之乡，各地有什么名酒，我们那里就有什么商标。”这是苍南县不法分子的供词。去年底以来，宜宾地区公安、工商等部门先后破获１６起名酒假商标和假酒案，查获假五粮液、假尖庄商标２００多万套，挽回成百上千万元的经济损失。不法分子非法牟利少的１０多万元，多的上百万元。在收审的３２名案犯中，除５名是本地人外，其余２７人都是苍南县人。
    据了解，在成都、江苏等地，也流窜有苍南县的不法分子。他们不仅制造假五粮液，还制造假茅台、假泸州老窖等名酒，宜宾群众说：“真是祸起苍南。”
