Scientific Verification to Revitalize the Economy
Sichuan Decides to Develop "Three Rivers" Hydropower

According to Xinhua News Agency in Chengdu on May 24, (reporters Li Zhengjie, Ling Yun) relying on scientific verification and respecting expert opinions, Sichuan Province recently made an important decision: to fully develop the hydropower resources of the Jinsha River, Dadu River, and Yalong River, drive the stable development of industry and agriculture, and revitalize the economy of the "Land of Abundance."

To formulate a scientific and feasible hydropower development plan, the Sichuan Provincial Government invited dozens of experts in hydropower, geology, water conservancy, economics, chemical industry, agriculture, ecology, and other fields nationwide to conduct a comprehensive on-site investigation of the "Three Rivers."

From April 18 to May 24, the investigation team spent more than a month investigating and verifying. The veteran experts climbed mountains and crossed rivers, covering over 5,000 kilometers. They successively investigated the Jinsha River, Dadu River, Yalong River, Min River, Jialing River, and more than ten other rivers. They inspected the already built and under-construction large and medium-sized hydropower stations, as well as the preliminary planning of nearly 20 power station dam sites. They also learned about the local mineral, industrial, agricultural, and ecological situations. After the investigation and verification, the experts believed that Sichuan's hydropower resources are unparalleled, with a theoretical reserve of 150 million kilowatts. Among them, the "Three Rivers" basin is the most concentrated area of hydropower resources in China. The rivers not only have large drops but also stable water flow. The development conditions are rare in the world. From the perspective of Sichuan's energy composition, coal accounts for 19%, natural gas 1.2%, and petroleum 0.1%, while the overwhelming majority of hydropower accounts for 71.7%. This determines that the way forward for Sichuan's construction is mainly to develop hydropower.

The experts pointed out that Sichuan's rivers not only have good sites for building giant power stations but also have many good sites for building medium and small-sized power stations. The experts suggested implementing a hydropower development policy with large hydropower stations as the backbone and medium and small-sized hydropower stations as the foundation. Especially in the next few years, it is necessary to encourage and support the enthusiasm of local power generation, implement the policy of using electricity to generate electricity, and concentrate efforts to build a number of small and medium-sized power stations with small investments and quick results to alleviate the current electricity shortage.

　　科学论证　重振经济
    四川决定开发“三江”水能
    据新华社成都５月２４日电  （记者李正杰、凌云）依靠科学论证，尊重专家意见，四川省最近作出重要决定：全力开发以金沙江、大渡河、雅砻江为主的水能源资源，推动工农业的稳定发展，重振“天府之国”经济。
    为了制定科学、切实可行的水电开发方案，四川省政府邀请了全国水电、地质、水利、经济、化工、农业、生态等方面的几十位专家，对“三江”进行了全面系统的实地综合考察。
    从４月１８日到５月２４日，考察团在历时一个多月的考察、论证中，老专家们爬山涉水，行程５０００余公里，先后考察了金沙江、大渡河、雅砻江、岷江、嘉陵江等十几条河流，查看了已建和在建的大中型水电站以及初步规划的近２０个电站坝址，了解了当地的矿产、工业、农业、生态等方面的情况。经过考察和论证，专家们认为，四川的水能资源得天独厚，水能的理论蕴藏量达１．５亿千瓦。其中的“三江”流域又是我国水能资源最富集的地区，河流不仅落差大，而且水量平稳，开发条件之好在世界上也是罕见的。而从四川的能源构成比例来看，煤炭占１９％，天然气占１．２％，石油占０．１％，占绝对优势的水电占７１．７％。这就决定了四川建设的出路主要是发展水电。
    专家们指出，四川的河流不仅有建巨型电站的好坝址，而且拥有众多的可建中小型电站的好电站点。专家们建议，实行大型水电站为骨干，中小型水电站为基础的水电开发方针。特别是近几年内，应鼓励、支持地方办电的积极性，实行以电养电的政策，集中力量建成一批投资小、见效快的中小型电站，以缓和当前用电紧张的矛盾。
