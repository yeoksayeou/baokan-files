150 Mu of cultivated land has been left fallow for 16 years.

In March 1969, relevant departments in our city (formerly Deng County) arbitrarily decided to requisition 150 mu of land in Gaotai Village of our township to build an agricultural airfield.

Over the 20 years since the airfield was built, except for the first 4 years when it was used 4 times for approximately two months, it has been idle for the remaining 16 years. The pesticide warehouse, radio station building, rest pavilions, and other facilities of the airfield, due to long-term disuse and lack of management, as well as wind and rain erosion, have all rotted and collapsed. Now, the surroundings of this airfield are overgrown with weeds, a desolate wasteland.

In recent years, Gaotai Village has repeatedly sent people to higher-level relevant departments to reflect on this issue, requesting the reasonable use of these 150 mu of cultivated land, but to this day, it has not been resolved.

　　１５０亩耕地被搁荒１６年
    １９６９年３月，我市（原邓县）有关部门擅自决定在我乡高台村征地１５０亩，建立一个农用飞机场。
    飞机场建成２０年间，除前４年使用了４次约两个月外，其余１６年全都闲置。机场的农药库、电台房、休息棚等设施，因长期不用，无人管理，加上风雨侵蚀，已全部朽坏、倒塌。如今这个飞机场周围杂草丛生，一片荒芜。
    近几年来，高台村曾多次派人到上级有关部门反映，要求合理使用这１５０亩耕地，但至今仍得不到解决。
