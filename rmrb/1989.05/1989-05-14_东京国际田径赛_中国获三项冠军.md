Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 14th.

The 1989 Tokyo International Athletics Meet was held today. Due to the participation of American sprint stars Carl Lewis, Floyd Heard, and the Chinese women's high jumper Jin Ling, who broke the Asian record just a week ago, the Tokyo National Stadium attracted a large number of spectators and reporters. After a day of competition, Chinese athletes won first place in the men's shot put, women's javelin, and high jump events.

In the morning, Asia's record holder, Chinese shot putter Ma Yongfeng, despite feeling that his technical condition was not ideal, easily won first place with a throw of 19 meters. Asia's men's long jump record holder Chen Zunrong, who was still recovering from an injury, achieved third place with a jump of 7.75 meters. Chinese women's javelin thrower Xu Demei, although she did not reach her personal best, still secured the top spot with a throw of 59.32 meters.

In the afternoon, Chinese men's pole vaulter Liang Xueren achieved second place with a height of 5.50 meters.

In the men's and women's 100-meter races, Americans Carl Lewis and Floyd Heard won first place with times of 10.39 seconds and 11.43 seconds, respectively. Chinese women's high jump newcomer Jin Ling cleared 1.92 meters to take first place. She then attempted to break the Asian record of 1.98 meters but failed due to strong winds, missing the bar three times.

As the competition ended, Joyner Kersee unexpectedly appeared on the field, greeting the audience and giving everyone a chance to see this retired American women's sprint star one last time.

　　东京国际田径赛  中国获三项冠军
    本报东京５月１４日电  记者于青报道：１９８９年东京国际田径赛今天举行。由于美国的短跑明星刘易斯、阿什福德以及一周前刚刚打破亚洲女子跳高纪录的金玲等名将前来参赛，东京国立运动场吸引了不少观众和记者。经过一天争夺，中国选手共取得男子铅球、女子标枪和跳高三项第一名。
    上午，亚洲纪录保持者、中国男子铅球运动员马永峰在感觉技术状态不尽如意的自我埋怨声中，以１９米的成绩轻松地拿了个第一名。亚洲男子跳远纪录保持者陈尊荣伤未痊愈，仍以７米７５的成绩获得该项第三名。中国女子标枪运动员徐德妹虽然没有达到自己最好成绩，还是以５９米３２名居榜首。
    下午，中国男子撑竿跳选手梁学仁以５米５０获得第二名。
    男女１００米，美国的刘易斯和阿什福德分获第一名，成绩分别是１０秒３９和１１秒４３。中国女子跳高新秀金玲越过１米９２取得第一名后，向１米９８的亚洲新纪录冲击，无奈顶着狂风难于起跳，三次越竿失利。
    比赛结束时，乔依娜意外地出现在运动场上，与观众见面，使人们再次一睹这位引退的美国女子短跑明星的风采。
