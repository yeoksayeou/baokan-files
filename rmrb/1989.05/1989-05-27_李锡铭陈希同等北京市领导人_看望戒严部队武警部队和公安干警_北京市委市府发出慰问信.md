Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 26th.

This evening, members of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and government, including Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Mayor Chen Xitong, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and all the people of Beijing, visited the troops enforcing martial law in the capital, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers. They expressed their sincere greetings and high respect.

Li Ximing and Chen Xitong told the troops, "In this serious political struggle concerning the fate of the country and the nation, you have come to the capital to carry out martial law tasks as decided by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. This not only contributes to the security of the capital and the restoration of normal order but also plays a major role in stabilizing the country. You have undertaken this sacred historical mission, and history will record your achievements."

Li Ximing and Chen Xitong said, "The troops enforcing martial law from outside Beijing have shown a high level of political awareness, strong organizational discipline, and good military skills since arriving in Beijing. When faced with obstacles and even insults from some misinformed crowds and attacks from a few lawless elements, you have shown great restraint, maintained high morale, and adhered to discipline. You have also carried forward the fine traditions of our army, actively and patiently explaining to the people, fully demonstrating the love of the people's army for the capital and its people and students. We believe that your actions will win the support and trust of the broad masses of the people. Those who temporarily do not understand or know the truth will gradually dispel their misunderstandings and ultimately understand and support you, helping you to successfully complete the martial law mission."

Li Ximing and Chen Xitong also informed the troops that currently, Beijing is carrying out extensive support-for-the-army activities from the municipal, district, and county levels down to the grassroots. The people are being educated to love the children of the people's army and to provide all possible conveniences to assist in the enforcement of martial law.

In other news, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal People's Government sent a letter of greeting on May 26th to all the troops of the People's Liberation Army enforcing martial law, all the troops of the People's Armed Police, and all public security officers.
