Two masterminds behind a series of thefts of railway cargo, Li Shikai and Zhang Maobai, were sentenced to death by the Beijing Railway Transport Court in Tianjin on May 18.

Li and Zhang, both farmers from Hebei Province's Huanghua and Qing County respectively, conspired with accomplices last August to October. They repeatedly stole large quantities of items including refrigerators, televisions, wood ear mushrooms, and cotton fabric from trains running between Cangzhou and Dezhou, as well as from the Cangzhou railway station. The total value of the stolen goods amounted to over 100,000 yuan. Six accomplices were also sentenced to terms ranging from one to seven years in prison.
