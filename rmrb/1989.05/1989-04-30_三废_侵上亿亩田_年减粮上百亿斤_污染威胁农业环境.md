Waste Pollution Affects Over 100 Million Mu of Farmland, Reducing Grain Output by Hundreds of Millions of Jin Annually

    Pollution Threatens Agricultural Environment

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 30th – Correspondent Xie Lianhui reports: At the Third National Conference on Environmental Protection, the Vice Chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection Commission and Minister of Agriculture, He Kang, revealed that in recent years, due to the rapid development of urban construction and industry, pollution has spread from point sources to widespread areas and from cities to rural regions, seriously threatening the agricultural production environment.

    According to investigations and estimates, farmland affected by industrial and mining waste pollution has reached approximately 100 million mu, resulting in a reduction of grain output by 100 to 200 million jin annually. Due to poor management, pollution incidents have been increasing rapidly.

    Ecological destruction is even more severe. Statistics show that nationwide, 36.67 million hectares of sloping farmland are affected by soil erosion, accounting for one-quarter of the total cultivated land. In the Loess Plateau region, soil erosion covers more than 70% of the total area. Currently, approximately 3.34 million hectares of farmland and 4.67 million hectares of grassland are threatened by desertification. Sichuan, known as the "Land of Abundance," has seen a 15% to 20% reduction in rainfall in 46 counties over the past decade. Previously, droughts in the Sichuan Basin occurred once every three years, but now they occur every two to three years. Other natural disasters have also increased.

    He Kang appealed at the meeting that the pollution and destruction of the agricultural environment not only affect the yield of agricultural, livestock, and aquatic products but also impact their quality. Ultimately, this will affect the health and living conditions of 1.1 billion people. He hopes that all sectors of society will pay high attention to agricultural environmental issues.

　　“三废”侵上亿亩田　年减粮上百亿斤    
    污染威胁农业环境
    本报北京４月３０日讯  记者谢联辉报道：第三次全国环境保护会议上，国务院环境保护委员会副主任、农业部部长何康透露，近些年来，由于城镇建设和工业的迅速发展，污染从点到面、从城市向农村扩散，已经严重地威胁着农业的生产环境。
    据调查推算，遭受工矿企业排放的“三废”污染的农田，已多达１亿亩左右，每年减产粮食一二百亿斤。由于管理不善，污染事故急剧增加。
    生态破坏方面的问题更多。据统计，全国水土流失的山坡耕地约３６６７万公顷，占耕地总面积的１／４，黄土高原地区水土流失已占总面积的７０％以上；目前，约有３３４万公顷农田、４６７万公顷草场受到沙化的威胁。素有“天府之国”之称的四川，近１０年内有４６个县降雨减少１５％至２０％。过去四川盆地伏旱是３年一遇，现在变为３年两遇，其它自然灾害也有所增加。
    何康在会上呼吁，农业环境的污染与破坏，不仅影响了农畜水产品的产量，而且影响了质量，最终将影响１１亿人民的体质与生存条件。他希望社会各界高度重视农业环境问题。
