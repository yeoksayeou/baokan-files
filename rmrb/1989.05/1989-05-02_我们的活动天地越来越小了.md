Title: Our Activity Space is Getting Smaller and Smaller

Our activity space is getting smaller and smaller. The only teaching building in our school was constructed in 1981. At that time, the township designated 56 mu (approximately 3.7 hectares) as the school's campus area. We planted trees, created gardens, and cultivated grass within the campus, creating a relatively good learning environment. In 1987, the township, in order to develop the economy, demolished the school's walls and built a 10-chamber dragon kiln right next to the teaching building, reducing the 56 mu campus to just over 10 mu. Less than 30 meters east of the teaching building is a brick and tile pressing workshop, where machines roar all day. In class, teachers have to raise their voices to teach, but students still often can't hear clearly. Directly south of the teaching building, about 70 meters away, is the dragon kiln, spewing black smoke that billows straight into the classrooms. Students are choked, coughing, tearing up, and even experiencing chest tightness and vomiting. To the north and west of the teaching building are the dragon kiln's open-air drying fields, with rows of "walls" and "mud dragons" confining us to a narrow space.

Adults say that when this dragon kiln was built, the township invested over 300,000 yuan. Two years have passed, and not only has there been no income, but there is also a loss of over 100,000 yuan.

Relevant departments should seriously consider our opinions and stop doing things that arbitrarily occupy school grounds and harm students' physical and mental health.

　　我们的活动天地越来越小了
    我校唯一的一栋教学楼建于１９８１年，当时乡里划定我校校园面积为５６亩。我们在校园内植树造林，栽花种草，创造了较好的学习环境。１９８７年，乡里为了发展经济，便推倒学校围墙，紧挨教学楼建起了一座１０多孔的龙窑，５６亩校园面积缩小到１０来亩。教学楼东侧不到３０米处，是压砖压瓦车间，终日机器隆隆。课堂上老师提高嗓门讲课，同学们还常常听不清楚。教学楼正南面７０米处是龙窑，黑烟滚滚，直冲教室而来，同学们被呛得咳嗽、流涕，甚至胸闷、呕吐。教学楼的北面和西面是龙窑的露天晾晒场，一道道“城墙”，一条条“泥龙”，把我们禁锢在一个狭小的天地里。
    听大人们说，这个龙窑建窑时，乡里投资了３０多万元，快两年了，不但没有收入，反而亏损１０多万元。
    有关部门应当认真考虑我们的意见，不要再干这种乱占校园，损害同学们身心健康的事了。
