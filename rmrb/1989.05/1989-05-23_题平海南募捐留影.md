According to reports: Beijing's Academy of Traditional Chinese Opera's young lecturer Ping Hainan, after eight years of toil, completed the book "The Network of Beauty," which was highly praised by experts but was stymied by the publisher's demand for 100,000 yuan. Ping Hainan, discarding the pretensions of an intellectual, stood outside the Qianmen Gate, begging passersby. However, within three minutes, he was taken away, accused of being an embarrassment to the nation's dignity because American KFC was holding a charity sale...

    A solemn face
    As solemn as a towering tombstone
    Standing in front of the American KFC fast-food restaurant in Beijing
    Making the crowd, lined up to buy expensive KFC chicken pieces,
    Shrink into a line of ants seeking food
    A woman, whom you deem unworthy of your attention, walks by
    She, with a burp of chicken flavor, looks at you
    A vulgar smile ripples across her fragrant, tender face
    Relying on this vulgar smile
    She is promoted from a section-level official to a bureau-level official
    And you—
    Your sanctity hangs from your towering neck
    For the sake of more people to appreciate the wisdom network
    You bravely externalize your priceless dignity
    Externalize it into a towering tombstone
    The inscription on the tombstone is the soul of the elite, forged in
    Bloody, howling cries:
    I, for my contribution to the nation,
    Seek—donations!

　　题平海南募捐留影
    龚明德
    据报载：北京戏曲学院青年讲师平海南，呕心沥血八载写成《美的网络》一书，被行家高度评价，却又被出版社索价１万元巨款难住。平海南撕下清高的知识分子脸皮，站在前门外挂牌向路人“行乞”。不料不出３分钟，便被带走，说是美国家乡鸡正在义卖，对比之下有辱国格……
    ——代题记。录自韩小蕙《我们活得太累了》
    你一脸庄严
    庄严得像高耸的墓碑
    屹立在北京的美国肯德基快餐厅前
    让列队高价购吃肯氏家乡风味鸡块的众生
    萎缩成一行求食的蚁民
    走过来一个你不屑一顾的娘儿
    扯着鸡味饱嗝看你
    俗笑荡漾在她那喷香柔嫩的脸上
    倚仗这俗笑
    她由科级晋升为处级
    而你——
    神圣吊在你伟岸的颈上
    为了智慧网络更多的人
    索性把无价的尊严外化
    外化为一座昂然的墓碑
    碑文是精英之魂熬炼的
    血糊糊的嚎喊：
    我，为我给民族的奉献
    募——捐！
