The Arab League

The Arab League, also known as the "Arab Union" or "Arab League," is an organization founded on September 25, 1944, in Alexandria, Egypt, at the initiative of Egypt. Representatives from newly independent Arab countries—Egypt, the Arab Republic of Yemen, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, and Jordan—convened to establish the organization, which was formally founded on March 22, 1945. In April 1950, the member states signed the "Treaty of Joint Defense and Economic Cooperation Among the States of the Arab League" in Cairo. The objectives of the Arab League are to strengthen relations among member states, promote cooperation, safeguard their independence and sovereignty, and coordinate their policies and activities. Member states are to respect each other's political systems, and disputes among them are not to be resolved by force. The member states are to cooperate closely in economic, financial, transportation, telecommunications, cultural, citizenship, social welfare, and health care sectors. The organization currently has 21 member states: Algeria, the United Arab Emirates, the Arab Republic of Yemen, Oman, Bahrain, Djibouti, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Somalia, Tunisia, Syria, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, Iraq, Jordan, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (now the State of Palestine). On March 31, 1979, Egypt's membership was suspended due to its signing of a peace treaty with Israel, and the organization's headquarters were moved from Cairo to Tunis.

The highest body of the Arab League is the Arab Summit, which discusses issues of common concern to Arab countries and the region. From 1964 to 1982, 12 summits were held. Between 1985 and 1987, three special Arab summits were convened.

The special Arab summit scheduled for May 23 and 24 in Casablanca, Morocco, will discuss Egypt's return to the Arab League and pass a resolution formally inviting Egypt, which would mean the lifting of the 10-year suspension of Egypt's membership in the organization. The summit will also address the Palestinian issue, the Lebanese crisis, Iran-Iraq peace talks, and the normalization of relations among Arab countries.

In addition to the summit, the Arab League has a council composed of representatives from all member states. The council holds two regular meetings each year and can convene special sessions upon the request of two or more member states. Decisions made by the council are binding only on the member states that vote in favor. The council has 14 committees and institutions under it, including political, economic, social, cultural, and legal committees. There is also a secretariat that handles daily affairs. The Arab League has offices or news centers in some non-Arab countries.

　　阿拉伯国家联盟
    阿拉伯国家联盟简称“阿拉伯联盟”或“阿盟”。阿盟是１９４４年９月２５日在埃及的倡议下，由新获独立的阿拉伯国家——埃及、阿拉伯也门共和国、黎巴嫩、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、伊拉克和约旦的代表在埃及的亚历山大商议后于１９４５年３月２２日成立的一个泛阿拉伯组织。１９５０年４月在开罗签订了《阿拉伯联盟国家联合防御和经济合作条约》。阿盟的宗旨是：密切各成员国之间的关系；为实现成员国之间的合作、维护其独立和主权协调它们的政策和活动；成员国相互尊重其国家的政治制度，它们之间的争端不得付诸武力解决；各成员国在经济、财政、交通、邮电通讯、文化、国籍、社会福利和卫生保健等方面进行密切合作。该组织现有２１个成员国：阿尔及利亚、阿拉伯联合酋长国、阿拉伯也门共和国、阿曼、巴林、吉布提、卡塔尔、科威特、黎巴嫩、利比亚、毛里塔尼亚、摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、索马里、突尼斯、叙利亚、也门民主人民共和国、伊拉克、约旦、巴勒斯坦解放组织（现巴勒斯坦国）。１９７９年３月３１日，埃及因同以色列签订和约，它在该组织中的成员资格被取消。阿拉伯国家联盟的总部也由开罗迁到突尼斯。
    阿盟的最高机构是阿拉伯国家首脑会议，主要商讨阿拉伯国家和地区共同关心的问题。从１９６４年至１９８２年共举行过１２次首脑会议，在１９８５年至１９８７年，召开过３次阿拉伯国家特别首脑会议。
    定于本月２３日和２４日在摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡举行的阿拉伯特别首脑会议将讨论埃及重返阿拉伯联盟，并通过向埃及发出正式邀请的决议，这意味着阿拉伯联盟将取消对埃及在该组织中长达１０年会员资格的冻结。这次会议还将讨论巴勒斯坦问题、黎巴嫩危机、伊朗—伊拉克和平谈判，以及阿拉伯国家之间关系正常化等问题。
    阿盟组织除首脑会议外，还有由全体成员国代表组成的理事会。理事会每年举行两次例会，也可应两个以上的成员国的要求随时召开特别会议。理事会作出的决议，只对投赞成票的成员国有约束力。理事会下设政治、经济、社会、文化、法律等１４个委员会和机构。此外还设有秘书处，负责日常事务。阿盟在一些非阿拉伯国家设有办事处或新闻中心。  　　　　　　　吴文芳
