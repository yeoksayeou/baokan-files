Barcelona Defeats Sampdoria 2-0 to Win European Cup Winners' Cup

	Newswire Geneva, May 10 (Reporter Li Ruifeng) One of Europe's three major cup football tournaments, the Cup Winners' Cup final, was held tonight in the Swiss capital Bern. The Spanish team Barcelona, with a swift attack, scored twice against the Italian team Sampdoria, lifting the Cup Winners' Cup.

	Barcelona, which boasts English star Gary Lineker and other top players, maintained a clear advantage throughout the match. The team's players coordinated well, had a strong attacking mindset, and solid defense, not giving the opposing team any chance to score.

	Just three minutes into the game, Barcelona launched a lightning-fast attack. Number 7, Lineker, received a pass from a teammate and quickly moved down the right side. As he approached the sideline, he passed the ball into the middle. The ball soared high over a series of players' heads and fell towards the left side of Sampdoria's goal. Quickly inserting himself, Barcelona's number 9, Julio Salinas, broke through the opposing goalkeeper and two defenders' defense, heading the ball past them into the goal. Roberto, number 10, then headed the ball into the net from just a meter away.

	Barcelona continued to defend solidly while using fast counterattacks to threaten the opposing team. In the 32nd minute of the second half, number 9, Salinas, received a clever pass from a teammate and went one-on-one towards Sampdoria's goal. The Sampdoria goalkeeper abandoned the goal to make a save, leaving the goal wide open. Despite being blocked in front and pursued from behind, Salinas calmly shot the ball, which flew into the net from the right lower corner of the goal.

	Barcelona had previously won the Cup Winners' Cup in 1987.

　　以二比零击败意大利桑普多里亚队
    巴塞罗那队捧走欧洲足球优胜者杯
    新华社日内瓦５月１０日电（记者李锐锋）欧洲三大杯足球赛之一的优胜者杯决赛今晚在瑞士首都伯尔尼举行，西班牙巴塞罗那队以快速的突击两度敲开意大利桑普多里亚队的大门，捧走优胜者杯。
    拥有英籍著名球星莱因克尔等好手的巴塞罗那队比赛中始终处于明显优势，队员们配合默契，进攻意识强，防守也好，不给对方以任何得手的机会。
    开赛后刚３分钟，巴塞罗那队就发动了一次闪电般的进攻。７号莱因克尔接同伴传球后从右路快速沉底，靠近底线时把球传中，球高高地越过一系列队员的头顶，落向桑普多里亚队大门左侧。迅速插上的巴塞罗那队９号尤里奥·萨利那斯突破对方守门员及两名后卫的夹击，以头球摆渡给埋伏在离大门仅一米处的１０号罗伯托。罗伯托把球顶入大门。
    巴塞罗那队在稳守的同时，利用快速反击威胁对方。下半时进行到３２分钟时，９号萨利那斯接同伴的巧传后单刀赴会，直逼桑队大门。桑队守门员弃门出击，大门洞开。在前有堵截、后有追兵的情况下，萨利那斯冷静地起脚射门，球从大门右下角飞入网窝。
    巴塞罗那队曾于１９８７年获得过一次优胜者杯赛冠军。
