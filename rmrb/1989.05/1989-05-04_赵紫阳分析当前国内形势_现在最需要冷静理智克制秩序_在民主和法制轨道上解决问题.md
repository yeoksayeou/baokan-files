Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 4th.

Zhao Ziyang, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, said today: "Currently, the protests by some students in Beijing and other cities are still ongoing. However, I firmly believe that the situation will gradually subside, and China will not experience major turmoil. I have full confidence in this."

Zhao Ziyang emphasized that what is most needed now is calmness, rationality, restraint, and order, and to solve problems within the framework of democracy and the rule of law.

Zhao Ziyang made these remarks during a meeting with the heads of delegations attending the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank and senior officials of the ADB.

Zhao Ziyang analyzed the current domestic situation in China to the guests. He said, "You all know that recently, a portion of students in China have taken to the streets in protests. Does this mean that China's political situation is unstable? I want to emphasize that the basic slogans of the student protests are 'Support the Communist Party,' 'Support Socialism,' 'Support the Constitution,' 'Support Reform,' 'Advance Democracy,' and 'Oppose Corruption.' I believe this reflects the fundamental attitude of the vast majority of students towards the Communist Party and the government: they are both satisfied and dissatisfied. They absolutely do not want to oppose our fundamental system but rather want us to rectify the shortcomings in our work. They are very satisfied with the achievements of reform and construction over the past decade and with the progress and development of our country, but they are very dissatisfied with the mistakes in our work. They demand that we correct these mistakes and improve our work; correcting mistakes and moving forward is precisely the stance of our Party and government. Is there anyone attempting to and actually utilizing the students' actions? In a country as large as China, it is inevitable that there will always be people who hope to see us in turmoil and who will take advantage of the situation. It is unimaginable that there would be no such people. There are very few such people, but they are worth being vigilant about. I believe that the vast majority of students will understand this. Currently, the protests in Beijing and some other cities are still ongoing. However, I firmly believe that the situation will gradually subside, and China will not experience major turmoil. I have full confidence in this."

In discussing how to address the reasonable demands of the students, Zhao Ziyang said: "I think we should solve this within the framework of democracy and the rule of law, through reform, and with rational and orderly methods. Analyzing the specific situation makes this clear: Currently, students are most dissatisfied with the phenomenon of corruption. This is a problem that the Party and the government have been addressing over the past few years, but why do so many people have such strong opinions about it? There are two reasons. First, due to an imperfect legal system and lack of democratic supervision, some actual corruption cannot be reported and dealt with in a timely manner. Second, due to insufficient openness and transparency, some rumors are either misattributed, exaggerated, or fabricated. In fact, the vast majority of Party and state officials not only have low salaries but also have no other income besides their salaries and no special legal privileges. There are indeed people who violate laws and regulations, seek special privileges, and special treatment, but not as many or as serious as people have heard. Of course, the problem of corruption must be solved, but this problem must be addressed in conjunction with reforms to improve the legal system, democratic supervision, and increase transparency. Over the past year, we have publicly disclosed government procedures and results in several urban and rural areas, encouraged public supervision, and established public reporting centers, conducting some experiments. In this way, we have initially combined the fight against corruption with democracy and the rule of law. We are now continuing to summarize experiences and prepare to gradually expand this to larger areas and higher levels."

In discussing how to handle the student protest incident, Zhao Ziyang said: "I believe that this should also be solved within the framework of democracy and the rule of law, in a rational and orderly atmosphere. Now, we need to conduct extensive consultations and dialogues, with students, with workers, with intellectuals, with members of democratic parties, and with people from all walks of life. Within the framework of democracy and the rule of law, in a rational and orderly atmosphere, we should exchange views, increase understanding, and jointly explore solutions to problems that everyone is concerned about."

Zhao Ziyang pointed out that what is most needed now is calmness, rationality, restraint, and order, and to solve problems within the framework of democracy and the rule of law. He said: "The Party and the government are prepared to do this. I believe that students will support this, and people from all walks of life will also support this. If everyone does this, we will definitely achieve the goal of maintaining stability. I believe this will be a new, higher level of unity. On the basis of stability and unity, China's political system reform and economic system reform, and China's socialist modernization construction, will definitely proceed more smoothly. I am optimistic about the stability of China's political situation and the prospects for reform. China's investment environment will continue to improve. I hope that the information I have provided will help you better understand China."

　　赵紫阳分析当前国内形势    
    现在最需要冷静理智克制秩序 
    在民主和法制轨道上解决问题
    中国不会出现大的动乱。我对此具有充分的信心。
    游行队伍中的绝大多数学生对共产党和政府的基本态度：又满意，又不满意。他们绝对不是要反对我们的根本制度，而是要求我们把工作中的弊病改掉。
    现在学生最不满意的是贪污腐败现象。这本来是党和政府近几年来一直在解决的问题，但为什么有这么多的人有意见，而且意见这么大？两条原因：一是由于法制不健全，缺乏民主监督；二是由于公开化不够，透明度不够，有些传言无限扩大或无中生有。
    腐败问题是一定要解决的，但这个问题必须也只能同完善法制、民主监督、扩大透明度等改革措施结合进行。
    新华社北京５月４日电　中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天说：“现在北京和其他某些城市一部分学生的游行仍在继续。但是，我深信，事态将会逐渐平息，中国不会出现大的动乱。我对此具有充分的信心。”
    赵紫阳强调指出，现在最需要的是冷静、理智、克制、秩序，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。
    赵紫阳是在会见出席亚洲开发银行理事会第２２届年会的亚行成员代表团团长及亚行高级官员时说这些话的。
    赵紫阳向客人们分析了当前中国国内形势。他说，各位到中国来，大概都知道中国最近有一部分学生上街游行。这是不是意味着中国政局不稳定呢？我想强调指出，学生游行的基本口号是“拥护共产党”，“拥护社会主义”，“拥护宪法”，“拥护改革”，“推进民主”，“反对腐败”。我认为，这就反映了游行队伍中的绝大多数学生对共产党和政府的基本态度：又满意，又不满意。他们绝对不是要反对我们的根本制度，而是要求我们把工作中的弊病改掉；他们对十年来改革和建设的成绩，对我们国家的进步和发展，是很满意的，但对我们工作中的失误是很不满意的。他们要求纠正失误，改进工作；而肯定成绩，纠正失误，继续前进，也正是我们党和政府的主张。有没有人企图利用并且正在利用学生的行动呢？中国这么大，当然难免，总有人希望看到我们出现动乱，总有人会利用，不利用是不可想象的。这样的人极少，但值得警惕，我想绝大多数学生是会懂得这一点的。现在北京和其他某些城市的游行仍在继续。但是，我深信，事态将会逐渐平息，中国不会出现大的动乱。我对此具有充分的信心。
    赵紫阳在谈到如何解决学生的合理要求时说：我想，应该在民主和法制的轨道上解决，应该通过改革来解决，应该用符合理性和秩序的办法来解决。分析一下具体情况就清楚了：现在学生最不满意的是贪污腐败现象。这本来是党和政府近几年来一直在解决的问题，但为什么有这么多的人有意见，而且意见这么大？两条原因。一是由于法制不健全，缺乏民主监督，以致某些确实存在的腐败现象，不能及时地得到举报和处理；二是由于公开化不够，透明度不够，有些传言，或是张冠李戴，或是无限扩大，或是无中生有。其实，我们绝大多数党和国家机关的工作人员，不仅是低工资，而且除了工资以外并没有什么其他收入，更没有什么法定的特殊权利。违法乱纪，搞特权、特殊化的人，有，但并不像人们传闻的那么多，那么严重。当然，腐败问题是一定要解决的，但这个问题必须也只能同完善法制、民主监督、扩大透明度等改革措施结合进行。去年以来，我们在几个城乡地区公开政府的办事制度，公开办事结果，鼓励群众监督，并建立群众举报中心，作了一些试验。这样，就把惩治腐败同民主、法制初步结合起来了。现在正在继续总结经验，准备在较大的范围和较高的层次上一步一步推开。
    在谈到如何处理学生游行这一事件时，赵紫阳说：我认为，也同样应该在民主和法制的轨道上来解决，在理性和秩序的气氛中解决。现在需要广泛地进行协商对话，同学生对话，同工人对话，同知识分子对话，同各民主党派和各界人士对话。在民主和法制的轨道上，在理智和秩序的气氛中，交换意见，增进理解，共同探讨解决大家共同关心的问题。
    赵紫阳指出，现在最需要的是冷静、理智、克制、秩序，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。他说：党和政府准备这样做，我相信，学生会赞成这样做，各界人士也都会赞成这样做。大家都这样做，我们就一定能够达到维护稳定的目的。我相信，这将是新的、更高水平上的团结。在稳定和团结的基础上，中国的政治体制改革和经济体制改革，中国的社会主义现代化建设，就一定会进行得更加顺利。我对中国的政局的稳定和改革的前途持乐观态度，中国的投资环境将继续改善。我希望我介绍的这些情况能够有助于你们对中国的了解。
