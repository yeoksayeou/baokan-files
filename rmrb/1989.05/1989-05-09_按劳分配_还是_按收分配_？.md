Under the impact of the tide of the commodity economy, the dam of social equity is constantly crumbling, and the first to be hit is the intellectual community.

The phenomenon of "income reversal" between mental and physical labor is already a well-known social problem. However, in recent years, within the intellectual community itself, a new form of "reversal" has emerged.

This "reversal" occurs in some universities. With the rise of "paid services" and "revenue generation" in universities, a new distribution method has emerged, which is to distribute according to the amount of revenue generated. Some people say that the principle of "distribution according to labor" that we have long advocated is being quietly replaced by "distribution according to revenue." In places where "distribution according to revenue" is implemented, those who use the school's human, material, and financial resources to develop and run companies have incomes far exceeding those who engage in teaching and research. Even some elderly professors in prestigious universities, nearing their seventies, have to compete on an equal footing with young workers to earn piecework wages for tasks like television assembly.

It is undeniable that, in general, "more labor" in work usually corresponds to "more revenue" in economics. However, in the realm of universities, which has a special value judgment standard, "more labor" cannot be simply equated with "more revenue." Indeed, with the development of the commodity economy, universities are allowed to generate revenue and should "produce economic benefits," but undoubtedly, they should also "produce talents," "produce achievements," and "produce spiritual civilization." The "more labor" in the latter "three produces" is difficult to determine by the "more gain" in the former "one produce." Therefore, when discussing how higher education adapts to the development of the commodity economy, we must study a new topic, that is, how to establish the principle of "main body benefits" in universities.

The so-called "main body" here refers to the main part of the university's workforce, that is, the broad teachers and related personnel who directly undertake teaching and research tasks. They are the leaders of teaching and the main force of research, and of course, they are also the main body of the school.

The main task of universities is teaching and research. In establishing a competitive mechanism within the university, we should encourage those who make outstanding contributions to teaching and research. For those who go to "generate revenue" under the school's unified arrangement, they should not be discriminated against, and their legal rights should be protected. However, their income should not deviate too far from those engaged in teaching and research, the "main trunk." In the same school, we should still reflect the overall "distribution according to labor, more labor more gain" to adjust people's interests; rather than "distribution according to revenue, more revenue more gain"; and certainly not "we who generate revenue support you who teach." On the contrary, if a university does not have a high-level teaching and research team, it will no longer be a university.

### “按劳分配”还是“按收分配”？

　　“按劳分配”还是“按收分配”？
    吴常德
    在商品经济大潮的冲击下，社会分配的公平堤坝不断出现崩塌，首当其冲的是知识界。
    收入“脑体倒挂”，早已是众所周知的社会病。不料近年来在脑力劳动界的内部，又出现了一种新的“倒挂”。
    这种“倒挂”发生在部分高等学校。随着高校“有偿服务”、“创收热”的兴起，兴起了一种新的分配方式，即按创收多少的比例分配。有人说，我们一向倡导的“按劳分配”原则正在悄悄地被“按收分配”所替代。在实行“按收分配”的地方，那些占用学校人力、物力、财力搞开发、办公司的人，其收入远远超过搞教学、办科研的人。甚至有些名牌大学年近古稀的老教授，也不得不与青年工人一道“按件计酬”搞装修彩电的“公平竞争”。
    不可否认，通常情况下工作上的“多劳”与经济上的“多收”是成正比的。但在高等学校这块带有特殊价值判断准则的领地上，“多劳”与“多收”不能简单划等号。诚然，随着商品经济的发展，高等学校允许搞创收，应当“出经济效益”，但毫无疑问，它更应当多“出人才”、“出成果”、“出精神文明”。而这后“三出”的“多劳”，是难以用前“一出”的“多得”判定的。因此，我们在讨论高等教育适应商品经济发展时，必须研究一个新课题，那就是如何在高校确立“主体受益”的原则。
    这里的所谓“主体”，是指构成高校工作队伍中的主要部分，即直接担负教学、科研任务的广大教师及有关人员。他们是教学的主导、科研的主力，当然也就是学校的主体。
    高校的主要任务是教学与科研，在高校内部建立竞争机制，就应当更多地鼓励那些为教学、科研作出贡献的佼佼者。对于那些在学校的统一安排下去“创收”的人员，固然不应受歧视，其合法权益应受到保护，但也不宜使其收入脱离从事教学、科研的“主干”过远。在同一所学校里，还是要在整体上体现“按劳分配，多劳多得”，用以调整人们的利益关系；而不是搞“按收分配，多收多得”；更不是什么“我们搞创收的养活了你们讲课的”。与此恰恰相反，如果高校没有一支高水平的教学、科研队伍，它就“校将不校”了。
