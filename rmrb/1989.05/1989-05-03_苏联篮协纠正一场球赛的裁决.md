A closely watched "legal battle" in the Soviet Union has reached a conclusion: the Soviet Basketball Association's Executive Committee has decided that the champion of this year's Soviet National Basketball Championship is the Kyiv Builder's Team.

On April 25, the Kyiv Builder's Team faced off against the veteran powerhouse Central Army Sports Club Team in Kaunas to contest the championship of this year's Soviet Basketball Championship. The competition was extremely intense, and with 12 seconds left in the final quarter, the score was tied at 87-87. At this point, the Builder's Team had control of the ball. With only one second remaining, the team's number 5 player, Volkov, made a long shot that went into the basket just as the final whistle blew. However, the referee ruled the shot invalid. As a result, the Builder's Team lost the game in a 5-minute overtime period with a score of 93-98.

Public opinion was outraged after the game because spectators clearly saw that the basketball was released when the electronic timer still showed one second remaining. On April 27, the *Soviet Sports Newspaper* published a photograph capturing this moment on the front page.

Subsequently, the Builder's Team filed a protest. After careful discussion and voting, the National Basketball Association's Executive Committee decided that the Builder's Team would be the champion.

　　苏联篮协纠正一场球赛的裁决
    新华社莫斯科５月２日电  （张志强）苏联球迷十分关注的一场“官司”已见分晓：经苏联篮球协会主席团裁决，本年度苏联全国篮球锦标赛冠军为基辅建设者队。
    ４月２５日，基辅建设者队与老牌劲旅中央陆军体育俱乐部队在考纳斯市争夺今年全苏篮球锦标赛桂冠。双方争夺异常激烈，在终场前１２秒钟战成８７平。这时建设者队控制球。该队５号队员沃尔科夫在仅剩一秒钟时一记远投，球随着终场的笛声进入篮圈。但裁判判定此球无效。结果建设者队在５分钟加时赛里以９３∶９８输掉了这场球。
    赛后舆论哗然，因为观众清楚地看到，当篮球出手时，电子记时牌上还剩一秒钟。《苏联体育报》４月２７日也在头版头条位置刊登了记录这个画面的电视照片。
    事后建设者队提出抗议，全国篮协主席团经认真讨论和表决，作出了建设者队夺冠的决定。
