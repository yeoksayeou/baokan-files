A Rationalization Suggestion Saves 17 Million Yuan

    The People's Daily reports: Reporter Zhang Zhen Guo reports: The municipal government of Anhui's Ma'anshan City adopted a worker's rationalization suggestion, saving an investment of 17 million yuan.

    The Nanjing to Wuhu highway crosses a railway, and for over 20 years, countless vehicles have been obstructed here, sometimes getting stuck for two to three hours. The original plan was to build an overpass or change the route, both of which would require an investment of 17 million yuan. Later, Mayor Zhou Yude, with the agreement of experts, decided to adopt the suggestion made by workers Sun Baoguo and Wang Xinglin from Ma Steel and the 17th Construction Company. They proposed using traffic lights to control the crossing, with traffic police strictly managing it. After 500 days of trial implementation, the results have been excellent.
