**Collision and Call**

**Zǔ Wèi**

**Pre-theme**

Friends from different professions gathering to chat is a mini version of idle talk. The charm lies in the scattered topics like wildflowers on a hillside, and the "bees" of casual conversation flutter from one patch of flowers to another, wandering freely. Once, while chatting with a friend who studies economics, we wandered to a treacherous peak:

“In every country, the first generation of capitalists who accumulated original capital are first-rate scoundrels. In the initial stage of commodity economy and free competition, they cheat, deceive, and do anything, so Marx said that capital drips blood from every pore. Without this, dispersed capital cannot be concentrated to establish large-scale, socialized production. Today, in China, are official speculators and private speculators, these first-rate scoundrels, necessarily produced and must be produced?”

“All first-generation capital owners reinvest most of their profits to expand their profits. Adam Smith considers this the invisible hand; the more investors earn, the more they contribute to society. But in reality, some profitable state-owned enterprises, because money cannot go into the manager's pocket, spend it on bonuses, cars, entertaining, advertising, and so on; some speculators who make fortunes from reselling quotas store their money in foreign banks for lifelong use; some individual millionaires, unable to merge state-owned enterprises, go gambling and increase the crime rate.”

“What kind of first-generation entrepreneurs does China call for?”

**Post-theme**

“In a five-star hotel in Europe, a wealthy oil tycoon from a Middle Eastern country checked into the most luxurious presidential suite, bringing a sheep because the tycoon was used to drinking the sheep's milk. The sheep defecated in the presidential suite, and the hotel naturally intervened. The tycoon took out enough money to buy the entire hotel, insisting on sharing the room with the sheep. This is one type of entrepreneur. Talent, cultural literacy, and making money are not proportionally related.”

“Lee Iacocca, the CEO of Chrysler Corporation in the United States, once turned a disaster into a great fortune for Ford Motor Company. Ford envied his talent and eventually fired him. Iacocca started over and went to Chrysler Corporation, creating another great achievement. The American media called Iacocca the 'American spirit.' If he participated in this year's presidential election, he would be considered one of the most competitive candidates. This is another type of entrepreneur with high culture and high talent, who can become the backbone of society.”

Gu Xuehai chatted with me about the types of entrepreneurs in the world. Looking at his appearance and demeanor, I felt he was very similar to someone, very similar. Oh, whether it was his appearance or bearing, he was very much like the late overseas Chinese activist Liao Chengzhi! If a biopic of Liao was made, the director would definitely choose him to play the role. No wonder a Taiwanese entrepreneur, upon seeing him, said he had a lot of charm. An entrepreneur plus a diplomat's charm, a deal was struck immediately, investing $60 million to cooperate with him. At this moment, while chatting with the general manager of the Guangzhou Zhujiang Foreign Investment Construction Company, another unrelated image entered my vision—a certificate issued by the International Bridge Federation to Gu Xuehai, certifying that he won the Far East doubles championship in the 1988 International Bridge "Ibsen Cup" World Zonal Tournament! National-level bridge player! Bridge is considered by the world to be a "high-level intellectual competition and social game." There is also a statistic that most people who play this card are great politicians, scholars, and big entrepreneurs. I suddenly asked: Is Gu Xuehai, who combines the bearing of Liao, the bridge champion, and such a classified discussion of entrepreneurs, the first generation of entrepreneurs called for after the opening up?

**Modern novels have a new narrative method, that is, using objects to narrate people.**

The three most famous hotels in Guangzhou—White Swan Hotel, China Hotel, and Garden Hotel—are listed by an authoritative American magazine as three of the world's 69 famous five-star hotels. High-end hotels are cities within cities, cultural centers within centers, and special spaces for cultural elites to stay, exchange, and work. Among them, the White Swan Hotel won the National Quality Inspection Commission's design gold award, construction gold award, and construction gold award. This means that the people who designed and built this "special cultural center" contributed gold-level architectural language and management language. Who are they? It is the Guangzhou Zhujiang Foreign Investment Construction Company, which is the general contractor. This group of "Zhujiang people" also built the Guangzhou Tianhe Sports Center, which was praised by IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch as a "first-class sports competition venue" for the 6th National Games held here, as well as high-end cultural activity venues such as the Shenzhen Grand Theater and the Guangzhou Children's Activity Center. Just based on these creations, it can be narrated and depicted that the "Zhujiang people," including Gu Xuehai, are not entrepreneurs who bring a sheep into the presidential suite.

There is also a classical narrative method, as Goethe said, people confirm themselves through others.

Recently, Guangzhou City established the Education Foundation. Perhaps because Gu Xuehai believes in a modern development theory, that the development of society is rooted in the investment in human quality, and he has special achievements in education—he was the first to make training modern management technology talents who can compete in the international market as one of the general manager's job objectives and set quantitative indicators; he overruled objections and spent more than 200 million yuan to build a first-class quality and first-class living space kindergarten, sponsored more than 100 million yuan to Shuiquan Middle School; contributed 200,000 Hong Kong dollars and 1 million yuan to the Education Foundation. Therefore, Gu Xuehai was invited to attend the meeting. At the meeting, Hong Kong's famous entrepreneur Ho Ying-tung spoke and mentioned Gu Xuehai: "Old Gu, when he built the White Swan Hotel in 1979, knew nothing about doing business with foreigners, but he quickly learned and bought the best and cheapest equipment, building the cheapest high-end hotel in mainland China, 30% cheaper than similar hotels in China at that time..."

The insiders of Zhujiang Company provided an interesting annotation for Mr. Ho Ying-tung's remarks. At that time, Old Gu was just a materials group leader. He did the math: more than 70% of the cost of a hotel project is the purchase of materials and equipment. For a 2 billion yuan total investment, if the procurement was handled by foreigners, just 2% of the handling fee would take away 40 million yuan. And assuming these foreigners did not do anything wrong. He wanted to take over the procurement rights. At that time, a leader said with some concern: "Old Gu, don't joke around, when you go to Hong Kong, you can't even tell east from west, let alone go shopping?" Old Gu thought: I don't believe it! In 1949, Guangzhou had not been liberated, I was an underground scout and went to Guangzhou alone for the first time, I was only 20 years old, but I got the complete plan of the Nationalists' retreat to Taiwan from a Nationalist general. I, Old Gu, am not fearless, but I am not so cowardly. He dared to insist on taking over the procurement rights, with the strong support of Mr. Ho Ying-tung, and went to Hong Kong with 13 engineering and technical personnel. Before going, he thought, buying things just needs to go to a few places, compare prices, and you won't be cheated; who knew that there was no need to go door-to-door to buy things. In the free market mechanism, merchants flocked to him. They sought him out. They enthusiastically showed him samples, slides, introduced performance, price, after-sales service, and market coverage. The key is how to choose in this free competition and diverse choice. Mr. Ho Ying-tung said Old Gu learned quickly, I don't think it's because he is particularly talented, but because his behavior has two commands. One is the market command from the outside. He and the engineering and technical personnel first visited various equipment in large hotels in Hong Kong. Sensibly and rationally, they quickly improved their appreciation, knowing the best indicators of the equipment we need in today's world, and how to systematically handle the relationship between various commodity parameters, that is, quickly compiling a best market choice command for themselves in these commodities in today's world. Another is the command of conscience. He deeply knew that under the public ownership system, the right to purchase can be transformed into a means of bribery. Some people in power use the opening up to make money, the formula is: public ownership + power + evil = getting rich without effort. Gu Xuehai established a unique "purchase file" for every item purchased, the contents of which are: negotiation process, negotiation records, participants in the negotiation, signatures of engineering and technical personnel on the decision-making book, signatures of financial personnel, signatures of handling personnel, and finally Gu Xuehai's signature, and also attached a copy of the formal document of the purchase contract. The strange "file" effectively embodies and supervises conscience. Moreover, it became Old Gu's "armored car." You should know that some foreigners have connections with domestic officials, and officials often use hints or even orders to let us buy someone's goods. Old Gu only followed the market and conscience commands, defying the "order," which caused trouble. Someone spread rumors: "Why does Gu Xuehai buy that person's goods? Because he has a secret deal. Gu Xuehai's family, except for his wife, is all foreign goods!" Someone even slandered and defamed. However, Old Gu had this special purchase file "armored car," and he was not afraid of being swept by machine guns. You can sue to the heavens, and he is not afraid. Because Old Gu and the previous leaders of Zhujiang Company all followed the law, in the past 8 years, the company has operated more than 20 billion Hong Kong dollars of foreign-funded construction projects, purchased more than 800 million Hong Kong dollars of imported equipment and materials, signed thousands of various economic contracts with foreigners, and sent a large number of personnel to and from Hong Kong and Macao and abroad to do business. The world thinks it is the biggest piece of meat, but after multiple inspections by the government, it is awarded the title of "legal household"! In today's world of declining morals, we are very proud that our profits increase every year, and last year's per capita profit was 43,000 yuan, all earned by real skills of competition and hard work, bright money, and clean money!

Modern statistics have invented a new language to describe characters using numbers. In July 1988, the Guangzhou Municipal Social Science Research Institute used the most advanced social science document processing general procedure disk SPSS/PC+ in the world to make a report on the "internal public relations image" of Zhujiang Company, which is expressed in statistical numbers. There is a column in it: "Evaluation of the company's general manager Gu Xuehai" quoted as follows:

These affectionate "numerical languages" are not falsifying the statement that "the first generation of entrepreneurs must be first-rate scoundrels," right?

Gu Xuehai, with the bearing of Liao, sat at a modern popular style large desk, and through the media, in the capacity of the chairman of the Midstar Group registered in Hong Kong, made a speech: "I am very honored to have the opportunity to introduce to friends around the world this energetic and continuously developing Midstar Group Company... I hope that both parties can enjoy long-term mutual benefits in business results."

At first glance, it seems to be a public relations speech in business, but if you delve into the business performance of the Midstar Group overseas, you can seem to understand a bit of the "poetic eye" from the public relations speech.

In the Solomon Islands in the South Pacific (a friendly province of Guangdong Province), a wood processing plant, a wood decoration line, a toilet paper factory, and a plastic factory were established. In Sydney, Australia (a friendly city of Guangzhou), a T-shirt factory with a lot of orders was established. In Frankfurt, Germany (a friendly city of Guangzhou), a frozen food factory is being built near "Sahara." In North America, Alaska, a joint venture company for fishing and processing fish was established. In Hong Kong and Macao, large-scale construction contracting, real estate, and hotel management were carried out. In Houston, USA, real estate was owned, a Chinese restaurant was opened in Geneva, Switzerland, and real estate was invested in Canada...

These scattered stars around the world can see the unique spectrum of Gu's characteristics.

One is to struggle to do real business, not to establish a briefcase company that makes money quickly. This is a rare case. How many people go abroad to make money through trade? These people go abroad under various names and then rely on the power network in China to obtain import and export licenses and preferential policies, making money for themselves, or letting foreigners make big profits and themselves get commissions: enriching individuals and making the country poor. Gu Xuehai, however, went to Libya to undertake a project according to the policy of "going abroad to do business" in Guangzhou, and finally withdrew halfway due to political unrest! Why forget the lesson? After becoming the general manager, someone wanted him to withdraw the funds from abroad, saying that he was nearly sixty, and he couldn't do it for a few more years. Why not build a milestone building as the end of his career after the three major hotels are completed?

What is the internal cosmic command that controls Gu Xuehai's "outward-type" behavior? It is the cultural command of the "economic triangle."

"More than 120 countries form an economic pyramid or economic triangle," Gu Xuehai's voice was heavy. "Many economic statistics, we are in the last few places, far from the top. To approach developed countries, we must change the slope of the triangle. How? Looking at the path of developed countries, only by doing well in domestic and foreign real business. Official speculators and private speculators cannot make us go up, but only go down to the bottom. In history, some countries can suddenly rise from the bottom to the top through military conquest. Now, economic powers are all military powers, and this is also impossible. Yes, I am very clear, doing business globally, in my term, only to bear risks and will not see great results. But to make the country rise in the economic triangle, it must be done. My policy is to use the real estate industry, which sees results quickly, to make blood for other industries. In three years, we have made 32 million Hong Kong dollars in the real estate industry overseas. There will be a virtuous cycle with blood."

Wind and rain for two and a half years, there were five victories and six defeats, and there were losses and gains. Gu Xuehai insisted on settling accounts and "settling accounts after autumn." After calculating, the total investment in overseas real business has exceeded 200 million Hong Kong dollars, and the original funds have already rolled into a snowball, rolling bigger and bigger.

Looking at the stars of the Midstar Group Company's real business overseas, you can see the second spectrum of Gu's characteristics, that is, following the provinces and cities in various countries that are friendly to Guangdong Province or Guangzhou City to do business. Not only to seek local friendly support, but also to repay the friendly cities with successful business, mutual benefits, and shared prosperity, and to rise together in the international economic triangle, shortening the distance to the top.

Near the equator, Solomon. The capital has only one street, one traffic light, four policemen, no television, movies, or theaters. In the logging camp in the tropical rainforest, there are primitive tribes that live by gathering. The Zhujiang Company sent four young people there to start four factories. These trendy young people have taken root in this primitive land. They not only endured and adapted to the cultural desert life but also learned the local language and made friends with the chiefs and local officials. In the past, the Japanese hired a few whites there to cut wood, which was not mutual benefit and shared prosperity, but only to fight for economic benefits, sowing opposition and hatred, and could not stand it and left. But the first-generation entrepreneurs of the Zhujiang Company are following Gu Xuehai's command to rise together in the economic triangle: the factories they built have already started to recover investment; increased government revenue; increased employment opportunities for the local area; built roads to develop transportation and brought civilization into the primitive tribe. More interestingly, their business success also made a great contribution to China's diplomacy.

In Macao, with intelligence competition, a piece of land that can make a big profit was bought. But there were more than a hundred households living on this piece of land, many of whom were poor people. Gu Xuehai entrusted a company in Macao to handle the relocation. In the contract, Gu Xuehai drafted a special clause, the general meaning of which is: relocation must be on time and in accordance with the law, and absolutely no inhuman incidents can occur. If there is a complaint, the payment will be refused. This is a humane clause, a human rights clause, ensuring that this relocation is humane. Similarly, there is a piece of land that needs to be relocated, because the buyer only wants to relocate quickly and get early profits, without the modern humanistic command from the inner cosmos, there is no such clause, resulting in the relocation residents going to the Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong to petition.

Westerners scold some Japanese businessmen as "economic animals," but Gu Xuehai's self-design for himself and for the "Zhujiang people" is "economic big man." "Big man" is not a singular person, but a plural existence of a class. From his eyes that have seen the vicissitudes of life for 60 years, you can still see the torch of "working for humanity" that Marx lit there.

The Zhujiang Company bought 60,000 square feet of 32 suites of real estate in Houston, the U.S. space center, for $10! Such a strange deal has only happened once in U.S. history. Not long after the War of Independence, the United States forced France to sell a large piece of occupied land, including New Orleans, at the price of 5 cents per acre. However, when Gu Xuehai represented the Zhujiang Company to sign a contract with the seller Yang Xiaoyan (the famous international bridge queen) to buy 32 suites for $10, he was full of the noble friendship cultivated by bridge, which transcends worldly interests.

In the 16th century, the British, who invented the highly intelligent and elegant bridge, would never have thought that Gu Xuehai would incorporate bridge culture into corporate culture. According to calculations, bridge has 500,000 trillion kinds of permutations and combinations, but it will never be combined into the situation where Gu Xuehai brings bridge into the field of corporate public relations.

In 1985, the Zhujiang Company made a decision that the world found strange—the company, with Gu Xuehai as the full representative, signed a contract with the State Sports Commission to undertake the national women's bridge team, and set a military order to break out of Asia in three years. A company has a football team, which can be used for corporate "sports advertising"; a bridge team, a few "yuppies" playing in a small room, what benefit does it bring to the company? If it is not a "wrong connection" in Cantonese, it is because Gu Xuehai's personal hobby makes the company pay the price of 60,000 yuan each year?

Indeed, Gu Xuehai is a bridge enthusiast. He rotates like a whirlwind throughout the year, busy to the point of only being able to squeeze in sleep time, so his eyes are always red. However, he can still find time to play bridge and lead the national women's bridge team to compete internationally! It is precisely because he is a bridge enthusiast that he has created a bridge family that may not be found again in China: his daughter Gu Ling was awarded the title of "World Bridge Master," his wife Zheng Ruolan once won the Guangzhou City Bridge Championship, and his two sons who studied abroad in the United States were once members of the Chinese bridge team. Bridge has permeated Gu Xuehai's personality structure, wisdom structure, career structure, aesthetic structure, and family life. Why does bridge have such a strong permeation for him? This is related to his experience in the years of disaster. During the Cultural Revolution, he was labeled a "counter-revolutionary" for his derogatory remarks about the Cultural Revolution (54 "counter-revolutionary" statements), and was imprisoned for more than 50 days, locked up with criminals. Later, in the labor camp, he was beaten and forced to do the heaviest work, earning the nickname "Number Two Bull." He collapsed his body and had four-thirds of his stomach removed. It was precisely in this great calamity of body and mind that the entertainment of playing bridge elevated his suffering soul to a "kingdom of wisdom." Therefore, bridge has become a part of his life.

Since Gu Xuehai undertook the national women's bridge team, he has been carrying out a unique and ingenious super combination—bridging enterprise and enterprise bridging. On the one hand, the international competition of the national women's bridge team has risen year by year, and has already broken out of Asia and entered the world's top eight; on the other hand, the profits of Zhujiang Company have increased year by year with a considerable margin, ranking among the top excellent enterprises in Guangzhou. These two parallel rising curves are not coincidental. Because the two-headed bird that takes off side by side is on the same body of Zhujiang Company, and the person who leads the "two-headed bird" to take off is the same person—nicknamed "Nine-headed Bird" Gu Xuehai from Hubei.

Two amphibious figures—Yang Xiaoyan, who is both the chairman of the American Recovery Ship Company and the world bridge queen, and Gu Xuehai, who is both a bridge enthusiast and a Chinese entrepreneur—have, through many bridge competitions, made Ms. Yang Xiaoyan fully feel the power of Gu Xuehai's personality, the power of wisdom, and the power of will, and decided to turn the opponent on the bridge into a partner in the enterprise. She handed over the unfinished Alaska Eagle Fisheries Limited Company to Gu Xuehai of Zhujiang Company, and jointly completed the fishing business will of her late husband. Ms. Yang also signed an agreement with Gu Xuehai to jointly establish the Fuxing Trade Company in New York. Ms. Yang directed the Zhujiang Company to set up a point in Houston, the rising city of the United States, and performed the comedy of selling 32 suites for $10 to symbolize Sino-American friendship. Bridge, bridge, it has become a bridge for communication. Gu Xuehai also relies on this bridge, which is favored by economic and cultural elites from various countries, to lead his Zhujiang Company and Midstar Group Company to the world, and together build a mutual benefit economic rainbow.

At the end of 1987, the "Hainan fever" had already cooled down, and investors saw that the temporary difficulties in Hainan were too great and "waved their spears alone." Some even withdrew with deep disappointment. Gu Xuehai went at this time, and his thinking was completely different from others. He said, the cards in hand seem to have fewer points, but the colors are not bad. If you dare to call, you can win big. He bought about 100,000 square meters of land in Haikou City and invested more than 30 million yuan in real estate. Some departments in Guangdong Province thought that Gu Xuehai was throwing money into a tornado to plant wind, and was a big fool. There were more opponents and doubters. After a year, the first phase of the Longju New City real estate project (26,000 square meters) in Haikou City has been completed with three communications and one leveling, and the construction of the house has just started. The house was just being built, and more than 10,000 square meters had already been pre-sold!

"Mr. Gu, someone said that your style of managing a company benefits from your bridge-playing style," I asked. "For example, the 'Guangzhou Zhujiang Foreign Investment Construction Company Development Strategy and Five-Year Plan' that you presided over, which is full but not chaotic, big but not empty, has 14 titles like the 13 cards in your hand, and is played with sound and color. Someone said that the institutional reforms you carry out are always one step ahead, which is very consistent with your high-calling bridge style. Someone also said that your outstanding memory is trained by playing bridge."

"Hahaha, all are far-fetched! However, I have learned a method from playing bridge that is very useful. Other poker games, such as playing for 100 points or fighting for the top, are mainly determined by luck. Bridge is not, the cards played by one side will be passed to the opponents at another table, and the chances of good and bad are equal. It is precisely because the chances are equal that wisdom can be shown. Therefore, no matter what I do, I do not try to find good luck from the outside, but I am willing to accept the set of cards given to me by history and reality, and do my best on this set of cards. This way of playing cards, not only can you win, but more importantly, even if you lose, you can play a high-wisdom, high-tone 'big man'!"

"Profound! I have another question. Someone said you are stupid. You and your daughter often play bridge with high-level leaders. Why not take advantage of the opponent's winning card to make some requests for the company or for yourself?"

"I said it, playing bridge cannot rely on luck, you have to use skills and will to play the cards you reasonably get! Of course, managing a company is not exactly the same as playing bridge. Big luck, that is, the overall situation, is still very important. I always think: from the past few decades to now, I am still me, still this name, still this brain and this appearance, no, now I am older and fatter than before, but from the past few decades, I had no career, and today, it is precisely because of the big luck of reform and opening up that I, Old Gu, am completely different from the situation before. I couldn't even dream of it! This is not just me who have this feeling of being completely different and being reborn, many, many Chinese people have it. Therefore, no matter how many problems or mistakes there are in reform and opening up, I still truly support it. At the dinner table, I often have arguments with my children about the times. My children say I am the 'long live' faction. Yes, I am a 'long live' faction for reform, I can only play a high score in this set of cards."

**Call**

"Whether it is the post-war recovery of Japan and West Germany, or the rise of the 'Four Little Dragons' in Asia, none of them took the first-rate scoundrels, such as officials and their children's official speculation and the first rich gangsters' private speculation, as the vanguard and main force. The main force there is entrepreneurs with high culture, high intelligence, and high tone, who can win in the 20th-century international commercial war, because it is the 20th century." Gu Xuehai unconsciously thickened his Hubei accent. "However, the several Hubei friends chatting about how to ensure that profits are not consumed and can be reinvested is indeed a sore spot in the reform of public ownership."

After the collision of the pre-theme and post-theme, I suddenly thought of a plural "us." I suddenly felt that the entrepreneurs we want to call out and who can be skilled in the late 20th century in China are not mysterious. Just add a "us" after Gu Xuehai's name:

"Gu Xuehai us! Gu Xuehai us..."

　　对撞与呼唤
    祖慰
    前主题
    不同行当的朋友们相聚胡扯是迷你型的。迷在话题似乱开的漫山野花，神聊的“蜂”群从这片花飞到那片花，逍遥神游。有一次与学经济的朋友神游到了一处险峰：
    “世界各国凡第一代原始积累的资本家都是第一流坏蛋。在初始的商品经济的自由竞争中，他们坑蒙拐骗，什么都干，所以马克思说资本的每个毛孔都流血。不这样不能使分散的资本集中而搞大工业社会化生产。今天中国出官倒、私倒等第一流坏蛋是不是必然产生和必须产生的？”
    “凡第一代资本拥有者，都将其绝大部分再投资，以扩大利润。这种钱生钱的活动，亚当·斯密认为是只看不见的手，投资者赚得越多，对社会贡献越大。可我们所见到的现实：有些盈利的国营企业因钱装不到厂长腰包里却拚命发奖金买汽车请客送礼及为自己做广告而花掉；有的倒卖批文暴发者把钱存入外国银行以供终生受用；有的个体致富者大把钱无法兼并国营企业就去嫖去赌以增加社会犯罪率。”
  “中国呼唤什么样的第一代企业家？”
  　　　　　　后主题
  　　　　　　　△
    “欧洲的一家五星宾馆，有位中东某国的石油大老板住进了最豪华的总统套间，带着一头羊，因为老板喝惯了这头羊的鲜奶。羊在总统间拉屎拉尿，宾馆当然干涉。大老板拿出了可以买下这家大宾馆的钱，坚持要人羊共处。——这是一种类型的企业家。才能、文化素质与赚钱之间没有正比例相关。
    “美国克来斯拉公司的总裁亚科卡，他曾经使福特汽车公司化大灾为大福。福特嫉贤，最后辞退了亚科卡。亚科卡另起炉灶，到克来斯拉汽车公司，又是一个赫赫伟业。美国舆论界称亚科卡为‘美国精神’，这届美国总统竞选，如果他参加竞选，认为他是最有竞争力的竞争人选之一。——这又是一种具有高文化、高才能的能成为社会脊柱的企业家……”
    辜学海在同我闲聊着世界上的企业家类型。我看着他的音容笑貌觉得他很像某一个人，十分像。喔，无论是他的外貌还是气度太像已故侨务活动家廖承志了！如果拍廖公的传记片，导演一定会选他当演员。难怪一位台湾企业家一见他就说他很有魅力，企业家加上外交家的魅力，一拍即合，投下六千万美金与他合作。此时，我在同这位广州珠江外资建设总公司总经理神聊时视觉里又闯进来一个风马牛不相及的物象——一份由国际桥牌联合会签发给辜学海的证书，证明他在１９８８年国际桥牌“易卜生杯”的世界分区大赛中获得远东区双人赛的冠军！国家级桥牌运动员！桥牌被世人认为是“高级的智力竞赛和社交游戏”。还有个统计，打这种牌的人，大政治家、大学者、大企业家居多数。我忽然追问：廖公的派头、桥牌冠军和如此分类企业家的谈话，三者合一的辜学海是开放后被呼唤的第一代企业家吗？
  △
    现代小说有一种新叙述方法，即用物来叙述人。
    广州无人不晓的三大宾馆——白天鹅宾馆、中国大酒店、花园酒店；被美国一家权威刊物列为世界６９家著名五星级酒店之三。高级宾馆是城市中的城市，文化中心的中心，是文化精英人物在此下榻、交流和工作的特别空间。其中的白天鹅宾馆获得了国家质量审定委员会颁发的设计金质奖、组织建设金质奖、施工金质奖。也就是说，设计和建造这个“特别文化中心”的人们奉献了金奖的建筑学语言和经营学语言。是谁？是辜学海所在的珠江外资建设总公司总承包的。这群“珠江人”还建造了被国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇称为“第一流体育比赛场所”的第六届全运会在此举行的广州天河体育中心，还有高档文化活动场所——深圳大歌剧院、广州儿童活动中心等等。就凭这一些创造物就能叙述描绘出包括辜学海在内的“珠江人”决不是牵一头羊进总统套间的那类企业家。
    还有一种古典的叙述法，即歌德说的，人从他人中确认自己。
    近来，广州市成立教育基金会。大概因为辜学海信奉一种现代发展理论，认为社会的发展植根于对人的素质的投资，并且他在教育上有着特别的四举——始作俑者地把培训能在国际市场上竞争的现代经营技术型人才作为总经理的一项任职目标，并规定了量化指标；力排众议拿出２００多万元建办了一个第一流教育质量和第一流生活空间的幼儿园，赞助水均岗中学１００多万元；为教育基金会资助２０万港元和１０万元人民币。因此，辜学海应邀出席大会。会上，香港著名的大企业家霍英东致辞时还讲到了辜学海：“老辜在１９７９年造白天鹅宾馆时，对外做生意什么也不懂，可他很快学会了，买回了最好的最便宜的设备，在中国大陆造了个最便宜的高级宾馆，比国内当时同类宾馆便宜３０％……”
    珠江公司的知情人，为霍英东先生这几句评语作了有趣的注解。那时老辜还只是个材料组长。他算了笔账：一项宾馆工程７０％以上的费用是购材料和设备。２亿元总投资，如果采购让外商去搞，仅２％的手续费就拿走４００万元。还假定这些外商不搞任何手脚。他要把这个采购权争过来。当时有位领导人不无担心地说：“老辜，别开玩笑了，到了香港，你连东南西北都分不清，还想去采购？”老辜心里想：我不信！１９４９年广州还没解放，我当地下侦察员只身第一次潜入广州，那时才是２０岁的毛头小子，就从国民党少将手里弄到了国民党撤退去台湾的总计划，我老辜不算浑身是胆，也不会这么胆小如鼠。他斗胆执拗地争来了采购权，在霍英东先生鼎力支持下，同１３名工程技术人员去了香港。去前他想，买东西只要多跑几处，货比三家就上不了当；谁知根本用不着上门求货，自由市场机制下的商人们闻讯蜂拥而至。他们求你接见。满腔热情地给你看样品，看幻灯片，介绍性能、价格、售后服务及市场覆盖率。关键在于你在这自由竞争的多元选择面前怎样抉择。霍英东先生说老辜学得快，我看不是他特别有天才，而是他的行为有两个指令。一个，是来自外部的市场指令。他和工程技术员们首先参观香港各大宾馆的各种设备。感性加理性地迅速提高自己的鉴赏力，知道我们所需的设备在当今世界上的各项指标的最佳值是什么，以及如何系统地处理各项商品参数的关系，也就是说，很快为自己编出了一个当今世界在这些商品上的最佳市场选择指令。再一个，就是良知指令。他深知，公有制条件下，购物权是可以异化为收贿的手段的。某些权力在握的人利用开放发国难财，其公式是：公有制＋权力＋缺德＝得来全不费功夫的暴发。辜学海为每项购进的商品建立了一个绝无仅有的“购货档案”，档案内容是：谈判过程，谈判记录，参加谈判人员，购物决策书上的工程技术人员签字、财务人员签字、经办人员签字，最后是辜学海签字，同时还附有购物合同正式文件的副本。奇特的“档案”有效地体现并监督了良知。而且，还成了老辜勇往直前的“装甲车”。你应该知道，一些外商与国内有权人拉上了关系，有权人常常用暗示甚至用指示让我们买某某商人的货。老辜只遵从市场和良知的指令违背了“指示”，这就惹来了麻烦。有人造舆论说：“辜学海为什么买那个人的东西？因为他暗中有交易。辜学海家除了老婆不是洋货其他全都是！”有人干脆诬告诽谤。然而，老辜有了这个特别购货档案的“装甲车”，根本不怕机关枪横扫，你告到天王老子那里也不怕。由于老辜和珠江公司前几任领导都以法为天，８年来，公司经营２０多亿港元的外资建设工程，采购８亿多港元进口设备材料，与外商签订上千份各种经济合同，大批人员往返港澳及出国办实业，世人都认为是最大的肥肉，可是经政府多次多方检查，全授予“合法户”称号！在这世风日下的今天我们很自豪，利税年年增长，去年人均利润４．３万元，全是凭竞争、实干的真本事赚的光明钱、干净钱！
    现代统计学又发明了一种用数字叙述人物的崭新语言。１９８８年７月广州市社会科学院研究所使用国际上最先进的社会科学文件处理通用程序盘ＳＰＳＳ／ＰＣ＋，对珠江公司“内部公共关系形象”作了一个用统计数字表述的报告，其中有个栏目是“对公司总经理辜学海的评价”引述如下：
    这些多情的“数字语言”不是在证伪着“第一代企业家一定是第一流坏蛋”吗？
    辜学海以廖公似的气派，坐在一张现代流行款式的大写字台前，通过传播媒介，以在香港注册的中星集团董事长的身份致辞：“本人十分荣幸借此机会向世界各地的朋友们介绍这个精力充沛及不断发展中的中星集团公司……希望双方可以长期享有互惠的业务成果。”
    乍听是商业上的公共辞令，可深究中星集团在海外的多元化投资业绩，似乎可以从公关辞令中悟得一点“诗眼”。
    在南太平洋岛国所罗门的瓜岛省（广东省友好省）办起了园木开发场、木材装饰线条厂、卫生纸厂、塑料厂。在澳大利亚悉尼市（广州市友好城市）办了个订货十分兴旺的Ｔ恤厂。在西德法兰克福市（广州市友好城市）附近的“沙堡”正在建一个中餐食品速冻厂。在北美阿拉斯加合资经营了一个捕鱼和加工鱼类的公司。在港澳大搞建筑承包、房地产及旅游和酒店管理。在美国休斯顿拥有房地产，在瑞士日内瓦开办了中餐馆，在加拿大投资房地产……
    这些散布全球的几点星光，可以看到与众不同的辜氏特色的光谱。
    一是举步维艰地办实业，而不是兴立竿见影的皮包公司。此乃凤毛麟角之举。多少人身在海外不是靠贸易速富？这些人以各种名义出国，然后依托国内的权力网得到进出口批文及优惠政策，自己人赚自己人的钱，或者让外商赚大头自己得佣金：肥了个人，瘦了国家。辜学海却根据广州市的“出国办实业”的方针去办风险大、效益慢的实业。他这么精明的人为什么还冒傻气？在他当副总的时候，曾经力主去利比亚承包一项工程，结果因那里政治动乱而中途告退！前车之鉴怎么忘了？他当总经理后，有人要他把国外资金抽回来，说他年近花甲，干不了几年了，何不在三大宾馆建成之后再集中资金搞个里程碑大厦作为自己事业的终点？
    又是内宇宙的什么指令在支配辜学海的“外向型”行为？是“经济三角”的文化指令。
    “１２０多个国家组成了一个经济金字塔或经济三角”，辜学海语音凝重。“许多项经济的统计数字，我们在倒数第几位，离顶点很远。要想接近发达国家，就得改变三角形的陡度。靠什么？纵观发达国家走过的路，只有办好国内国外实业。官倒、私倒不能使我们倒上去，只能越倒越沉到底层。在历史上，有些国家还可以通过军事征服使自己突然由底层升到顶点。现在，经济大国都是军事强国，连这也绝无可能了。是的，我很明白，在全球办实业，在我任期内只会承担风险，不会大见成效。但是，为国家在经济三角里上升一定要干。我的方针是以见效快的房地产业来为其他实业造血。３年内，我们在海外的房地产业赚了３２００万港元。有血就会有良性循环。”
    风风雨雨的两年半，有过五关斩六将，也有走麦城失荆州，有亏有盈。辜学海力主算总账和“秋后算账”。一算，海外实业总投资已超过２亿港元，原有资金已经滚出雪球，越滚越大。
    纵观中星集团公司在海外实业的星光，还可以看到辜氏特色的第二种光谱，即紧随广东省或广州市的在各国的友好省友好市去办实业。不仅是为了寻求当地的友好支持，还要以成功的实业报答友好城市，互惠共荣，一同在国际经济三角中上升，以缩短双方同顶点的距离。
    赤道附近的所罗门。首都只有一条街、一个交通红绿灯、４个警察，无电视、电影及戏院。热带雨林中的伐木场所，住着以采集为生的原始部落。珠江公司派了４位年轻人在那里开办了４个厂。这些新潮青年却在原始土地上生了根。他们不仅忍受和习惯了文化荒漠的生活，而且还学会了当地土语，与酋长及当地官员都结交了友谊。过去日商雇佣了几位白人在那里开伐，就不是互惠共荣，只是拚命搞经济效益，播下了对抗和仇恨，因站不住而走了。可是珠江公司的第一代实业家们却在那里正在按辜学海的在经济三角中共同提升的“指令”互惠共荣：所办工厂已开始回收投资；增加了政府的财政收入；为当地增加了就业机会；修公路发展交通把文明带进原始部落。更有意思的是，他们的实业成功还为我国外交出了大力。
    在澳门以智能竞争取胜买下了一块能大发一下的地皮。可这块地皮上住了一百多户人家，有许多是底层贫民。辜学海将搬迁之事委托澳门一家公司办理。在合同上辜学海拟定了一条特别的条款，大意是：搬迁不仅要按时，而且要依法办事，绝不能发生伤天害理的事，如有所告，拒不付款。这是一条人性的条款，人权的条款，保证了这次迁移合乎人道主义。同样有一块买下的地皮需搬迁住户，因为买主一味求快迁而早得收益，没有那个来自内宇宙的现代人性指令，就没有那个条款，结果是闹得搬迁户去香港新华社请愿。
    西欧人骂有些日本商人为“经济动物”，辜学海为他自己和为“珠江人”的自我设计却是“经济大写人”。“大写人”不是单数的人，而是一个复数的类的存在。从他阅尽人间沧桑６０年的善良眼睛里，仍然可以看到马克思在那里点燃的“为人类工作”的烁烁火炬。

    珠江公司用１０元美金买到了位于美国航天中心休斯顿６万多平方英尺的３２套房地产！这么出奇的买卖在美国历史上还有过一次，独立战争不久美国协迫法国将新奥尔良州等一大片占领地以每英亩５美分的奇价卖给了美国。但是，辜学海在１９８８年代表珠江公司与卖主杨小燕（著名的国际桥牌皇后）签１０元美金买３２套房的契约时，却充满了由桥牌陶冶出来的超拔世俗功利的高尚友谊。
    在１６世纪发明的高智能的高雅的桥牌的英国人，万万不会想到辜学海会将桥牌文化纳入企业文化。据计算，桥牌有５００００兆兆种的排列组合，但绝不会组合出辜学海把桥牌打到企业公共关系学领域之内的情况。
    １９８５年，珠江公司做了一个令世人感到怪诞的决策——由辜学海作为全权代表与国家体委签约，承包国家女子桥牌队，并立下３年冲出亚洲的军令状。一个企业搞个足球队还可以，用它为企业作“运动广告”；一个桥牌队，几个“雅皮士”在一间小屋里玩一玩，对企业有何益？如果不是广东话说的神经接错线，那就是因为辜学海的个人所好使企业付出每年６万元代价？
    不错，辜学海确实是个桥牌迷。他整年旋风式地回旋于世界及国内各地，忙得只能挤睡眠时间，因此眼睛总是红红的。可是，他却能腾出时间打桥牌和领国家女子桥牌队出国比赛！正是因为他是个桥牌迷，造就了一个可能在中国不会再有第二个的桥牌之家：女儿古玲荣获了“世界桥牌大师”的殊荣，夫人郑若兰曾获过广州市桥牌赛冠军，两位留学美国的儿子也曾经是中国桥牌队成员。桥牌已渗透进辜学海的人格结构、智慧结构、事业结构、审美结构和家庭生活。为什么桥牌对他有这么大的渗透力？这同他在灾难深重的年月里的遭遇有关。“文革”中他因对文化大革命有贬词（５４条“反革命”言论），而当了“现行反革命”。先是坐了５０多天大牢，与刑事犯关在一起。之后在干校一面批斗一面劳改，干最重的活儿，外号叫“二号公牛”。干垮了身体，切除了四分之三的胃。正是在这身心两溃的大劫难之时，玩桥牌的娱乐竟把他的苦难的灵魂超度到了一个“智慧的天国”。因此，桥牌已经成了他人生的一部分。
    辜学海自从承包国家女子桥牌队后，在进行着一项独具匠心的超常组合——桥牌企业化，企业桥牌化。一方面，国家女子桥牌队的国际比赛名次年年上升，已冲出亚洲列入世界八强之列；另一方面，珠江公司利润年年以较大幅度递增，名列广州市优秀企业的前茅。这两条平行上升的曲线绝不是巧合。因为，这并头起飞的双头鸟长在同一个珠江公司的身体上，而引领“双头鸟”起飞的人又是同一个人——号称“九头鸟”的湖北佬辜学海。九头鸟引领双头鸟。
    两位两栖型人物——既是美国复康轮船公司董事长又是世界桥牌女王的杨小燕，既是桥牌迷又是中国企业家的辜学海——在多次桥牌比赛中使杨小燕女士对辜学海的人格的力量、智慧的力量、意志的力量有了充分的感受，才决定把牌场上的对手变成企业上的合作伙伴。她将行先天未竟的阿拉斯加鹰渔有限公司重担给珠江公司的辜学海，合资完成先夫的捕鱼实业遗愿。杨女士还同辜学海签订协约，在纽约合资办了福星贸易公司。杨女士为珠江公司能在美国的朝阳性城市休斯顿设点开拓，导演了以１０美元卖３２套房的象征中美友谊的喜剧。桥牌桥牌，变成了心灵沟通之桥。辜学海还是依托这个各国经济文化精英分子所钟爱的桥牌之桥，带着他的珠江公司、中星集团公司走向全球，再共同造起互惠的经济彩虹。
    １９８７年底，“海南热”已经冷却下来，各路投资者看到海南的暂时困难太大而“荷戟独彷徨”，有的干脆带着沉沉的沮丧大撤退了。辜学海在这个时候去了，他的思路与别人完全不同。他说，手上的牌看来牌点是少了些，但是花色不错，若能敢叫就能大赢。他买了海口市约１０万平方米的地皮，投资３０００多万元搞房地产。广东省有些部门认为辜学海是把钱扔进了龙卷风里放风笋，是个大笨蛋。反对者众，怀疑者更众。时过一年，海口市龙珠新城房产首期工程（２．６万平方米）已完成三通一平，开始响锤打桩。房子刚打桩，就已经预售出一万多平方米了！
    “辜总，有人说你治企业的风格受益于你的打桥牌风格，”我问。“譬如，你主持制定的《广州珠江外资建设总公司发展战略和五年规划》，多而不乱、大而不空，全文１４个标题就像你手中１３张牌，打得有声有色。有人说你搞的体制改革总是一步到位，很符合你叫高不叫低的叫牌风格。有人还说你记忆力出众是桥牌训练出来的。”
    “哈哈哈，全是牵强附会！不过，我从打桥牌中悟到个方法很管用。其他扑克牌游戏，如打百分、争上游，都由牌运起主要作用。桥牌却不，一方打过的牌将交给另一桌的对手去打，好坏机会均等。正是机会均等方能显出智慧本色。所以，我不管做什么，不是去挖空心思找外部的好运气，而是甘心接受历史和现实给我的一副牌，就在这副牌上做足文章。这么个打牌法，不仅可能打赢，更重要的是，即使打输了，也会打出一个高智慧、高格调的‘大写人’来！”
    “精辟！我还有个问题，有人说你傻，你和你的女儿常同高层领导人打桥牌，为什么不趁对方赢牌高兴时为企业为个人提点什么要求？”
    “我不是说了吗？打桥牌不能靠牌运，要靠技巧与意志打你合理得来的那副牌！当然，办企业并不完全雷同于打桥牌。大运气即大局还是很重要。我总想：过去几十年到现在，我还是我，还是这个名字，还是这个大脑和这副模样，不，现在比以前老了、胖了，但是，过去几十年我没有任何事业，今天，就是由于改革开放这个大运气，我老辜就与以前的情况完全不同了。过去做梦都梦不出来！这不是我一个人有这种判若两人感和重新投胎感，很多很多中国人都有。因此，不管改革开放还有多少问题或失误，我还是真心拥戴。在饭桌上我和孩子们关于时势的评价常有争论，孩子们说我是‘万岁派’。是的，我是改革万岁派，只能在这副牌里打出个高分来。”
  呼唤
    “无论是战后日本与西德的复兴，还是亚洲‘四小龙’的崛起，都不是以有权人及其子弟的官倒及首先富起来的流氓无产者的私倒等等第一流坏蛋来作为先导及主力军的。那里的主力军是以高文化、高智能、高格调的能在２０世纪国际商战中制胜的企业家，因为现在是２０世纪。”辜学海下意识地加浓了湖北家乡口音。“不过，你们几位湖北朋友聊天聊到的怎么保证利润不被消费掉而能再投资，倒是公有制改革的一块心病。”
    在前后主题对撞之后，我忽然想到一个复数的“们”。我忽然觉得，我们要呼之欲出的能游刃于２０世纪末叶的中国企业家并不玄，在辜学海名字后加个“们”字：
    “辜学海们！辜学海们……”
