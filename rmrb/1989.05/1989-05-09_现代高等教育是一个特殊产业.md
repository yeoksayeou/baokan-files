People's Daily reporter Chen Xinggui

Li Enyuan, graduated from Beijing University's School of Engineering in 1951. After graduation, he led the construction of disciplines such as water resources, mechanical engineering, nuclear energy, and mechanics at Tsinghua University for 30 years. In 1982, he became the president of Beijing Institute of Light Industry, and is currently the president of Beijing United University.

Reporter: The reform of the university system needs a breakthrough. What do you think is the key issue at present?

Li Enyuan: I think that to discuss the reform of the educational system, it is necessary to re-examine modern higher education. As people often say, we need to change our mindset first. Modern higher education is linked to large-scale production, the development of a commodity economy, the development of new science and technology, the construction of spiritual civilization, and the transformation of the industrial structure from labor-intensive to knowledge-intensive. There are many other aspects. These characteristics indicate that modern higher education is an industry that improves and enhances the quality and ability of workers. This is the starting point for my consideration of higher education reform.

Reporter: According to your view, modern higher education is a crucial industry in the development of the social economy, and the guiding ideology and basic principles of economic system reform should also be applicable to the reform of the higher education system. Do you think so?

Li Enyuan: This is precisely the issue I have been considering repeatedly.

Reporter: Economic system reform starts with the idea that factory products must adapt to the market and be "marketable." Does the reform of the university system also need to start with the "marketability" of students?

Li Enyuan: Exactly. Factories produce products that must be guided by the market and be "marketable." Higher education institutions should also adapt to the needs of the talent market and be "marketable." I believe this is the breakthrough point for educational system reform. With the development of the commodity economy and the implementation of the civil service system in government agencies, the talent market will inevitably introduce a competitive mechanism into the entire process of talent assessment, selection, appointment, recruitment, training, and rewards and punishments. In this situation, enterprises and institutions will inevitably use assessment and recruitment methods to replace the old practice of centralized allocation and organizational assignment (with the exception of a few special disciplines). Regardless of the quality of graduates or whether they meet the actual needs of society, the old practice of the state taking full responsibility will have to change. This change means that higher education institutions must consider "marketability" when training students. By "marketability," I mean the setting of disciplines, training models, teaching content, training methods, and student quality.

Reporter: "Marketability" will change the way universities operate.

Li Enyuan: Yes, it will first help to overcome the long-standing closed, self-improving system, mindset, and way of thinking in higher education institutions, breaking through in terms of mindset, and promoting schools to actively adapt to the development of the commodity economy and modern science and technology. Secondly, for students, it will help to clarify the concept of studying and finding a job, making students consciously tap into their own learning potential and initiative. Thirdly, it will pave the way for changing the "walled" model of higher education institutions and building an open teaching system. There is also a very important point: it will place higher education institutions directly under the evaluation, assessment, and regulation of society, putting schools directly into the large system of social evaluation, making schools feel the pressure, and making schools always pay attention to the specifications, levels, and quality of training students, and consciously strengthen their connection with society, and enhance the awareness of educational reform.

Reporter: Your thoughts on "marketability" make a lot of sense. But implementing it is a difficult task.

Li Enyuan: This is precisely the second point I want to discuss, which is that higher education institutions should implement the principle of separating government and school, and separating ownership from educational authority, and expanding the autonomy of schools. Without this, "marketability" cannot be achieved.

People have always regarded universities as subordinate to certain government departments, forming a dependent relationship between higher education institutions and government departments. Under this system, students are "purchased and sold" centrally, and schools do not need to consider "marketability" or spend effort considering the needs of society. The supervising department decides how to handle things, and schools are in a completely passive position. It is more accurate to say that the government department is running the school rather than the school itself. Schools are almost identical, like products from the same mold. This situation is in line with the highly centralized planned economy. This system is not in line with the needs of the commodity economy.

The problem is clear: if schools want to train talents that are "marketable," schools should be independent social entities and legal persons, with full educational autonomy, ensuring that schools have the power to manage themselves according to law and protecting the legitimate educational rights of schools.

Reporter: In this regard, is the experience of economic system reform also worth referring to for the reform of the higher education system?

Li Enyuan: Some people say that schools train students, which is different from the production of goods, and the experience of economic system reform is difficult to borrow. I do not completely agree with this. Undoubtedly, the two are different, but in terms of higher education institutions as an industry that cultivates, trains, and produces high-skilled labor, in terms of industrial attributes, there is not much essential difference between higher education institutions and enterprises. Whether it is training people or producing products, both require social and market recognition, both need to shift from being responsible to higher-level government departments to being responsible to the needs of the social economy, and both need to be "marketable." In this sense, the experience of economic system reform is not something that higher education institutions cannot learn from.

Reporter: Enterprises implement the separation of government and enterprise, operate independently, and bear risks. If higher education institutions have educational autonomy and become independent legal entities, they should also bear risks. What are your thoughts on this?

Li Enyuan: Of course, schools should bear risks. I have considered this: if schools have educational autonomy, they are not necessarily able to run the school well. Power and risk are linked. After various schools have educational autonomy, in order to make the students they train adapt to the commodity economy and technological development, competition is inevitable. Along with competition, there will be "survival of the fittest," and risks will follow. Schools will have to constantly consider their own adaptability, adaptability to change, and competitiveness, and how to improve teaching quality, improve student quality, and perfect the mechanism to adapt to competition. This sense of crisis is the driving force for school educational reform. Currently, some long-term disciplines are in a state of being eliminated or changing their direction, and some disciplines that are urgently needed by society are developing, which shows this change.

Reporter: Under this new system, the mindset and behavior of students and teachers must also adapt.

Li Enyuan: Yes. The development of the commodity economy requires students of all disciplines to master the relevant science and technology, and also to understand commodities, the market, technical decision-making, operational decision-making, product decision-making, and even policy decision-making. The theory and knowledge that students learn are increasingly required to be a combination of multiple disciplines. It is necessary to change the rigid planned economic system reflected in higher education and form a single-discipline training model, establish an interdisciplinary comprehensive training model, and require students to have the corresponding cultural literacy, and develop in the aspects of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics, improve the comprehensive quality to adapt to the commodity economy and the development of science and technology, have a strong information awareness, competitive awareness, adaptability, pioneering, and innovative awareness. In a word, it is to cultivate students' self-adaptation ability. This self-adaptation ability reflects the quality of students. For this reason, higher education institutions cannot but carry out corresponding reforms, such as the direction and level of running a school, the setting of disciplines, the structure of knowledge, the training model, the content of teaching, the method of teaching, social practice, school management, ideological education, educational evaluation, etc., in order to strive to establish a mechanism for schools to self-regulate and self-adapt to social needs, so that schools can exist and develop. To ensure high-quality talents, schools must carry out real reforms in their requirements, training, and treatment of teachers. Only in this way can the enthusiasm and creativity of teachers, students, and school administrators be fully mobilized. In competition, in adapting to social needs, schools can form their own style and characteristics. In this sense, risk is the driving force.

Reporter: In this way, will schools not focus on developing disciplines and subjects that are closely related to the current economy, have quick results, while some disciplines and subjects that are very important for long-term development but have slow results will be neglected?

Li Enyuan: This problem exists, and this is also a topic that I often discuss with my peers in education. This problem shows that, like the development of the commodity economy, there is a need for national directive plans. The training plan of schools should be formulated according to the national directive plan and the demand of the talent market, appropriately handling the relationship between current and long-term needs, and avoiding short-term behavior in education. For disciplines and subjects involving long-term needs, new scientific technologies, and basic theoretical research, national directive plans should be used to solve the problem, and university presidents must ensure the completion of directive plans.

　　现代高等教育是一个特殊产业
    本报记者  陈兴贵
    李恩元，１９５１年毕业于北京大学工学院。毕业后在清华大学担负水利、机械、原子能、力学等学科专业建设的领导工作达３０年，１９８２年任北京轻工业学院院长，现任北京联合大学校长。
    记者：高校的体制改革需要突破，您认为当前的关键问题是什么？
    李恩元：我觉得要谈教育的体制改革，对现代高等教育进行再认识十分必要。正如大家常说的，首先需要转变一下观念。现代高等教育，一是与大生产相联系，二是与商品经济的发展相联系，三是与新的科学技术的发展相联系，四是与精神文明的建设相联系，五是与产业结构由劳动密集型向知识密集型转化相联系，还可以举出很多。这些特点，说明现代高等教育，是改善和提高劳动者素质和劳动能力的一个产业部门。这正是我考虑高等教育改革的出发点。
    记者：照您的看法，现代高等教育是社会经济发展中至关重要的产业部门，即经济体制改革的指导思想和基本原则也应当适用于高等教育的体制改革。您是否这样看？
    李恩元：这正是我反复考虑的问题。
    记者：经济体制改革是从工厂产品要适应市场、“适销对路”提出问题的，难道高校的体制改革也要从学生的“适销对路”入手？
    李恩元：完全对。工厂生产产品要由市场引导，适销对路，高等学校学生也一样，要适应人才市场的需要，要“适销对路”。我认为这正是教育体制改革的突破口。随着商品经济的发展和政府机关实行公务员制，人才市场的发展，竞争机制必将引进人才考核、选拔、任用、招聘、培养、奖惩的全过程。在这种情况下，企、事业单位对高校毕业生也必然用考核、招聘的办法代替统分和组织调配（个别特殊专业除外）。不论毕业生质量如何，也不管是否符合社会实际需要，全部由国家包下来的老办法势必要改变。这种变化，使高校培养学生就必须考虑“适销对路”。我这里说的“适销对路”包括专业设置、培养模式、教学内容、培养方法、学生素质等方面。
    记者：“适销对路”将改变高校的办学模式。
    李恩元：是的，它首先有利于克服高等学校长期以来形成的封闭的、自我完善的体系、思想观念和思想方式，在观念上有一个突破，促进学校主动适应商品经济的发展和现代科学技术的发展。其次，就学生而言，有利于在学生中明确求学、求职的观念，使学生自觉地去挖掘自身学习的潜力和积极性。再者，为改变高校的“围墙模式”，建立开放式的教学体系架桥铺路开道。还有非常重要的一条，使高等学校直接受社会的检验、评估和调节，把高校直接置于社会评估的大系统中，使高校产生压力，使学校时刻关心培养学生的规格、层次、质量，不忘和自觉地加强同社会的联系，提高教育改革的自觉性。
    记者：您关于“适销对路”思考颇有道理。但实施起来则是一个难题。
    李恩元：这正是我要说的第二点，即高等学校要实行政、校分开，所有权与办学权分离的原则，扩大学校办学自主权。没有这一条，“适销对路”是做不到的。
    人们历来把高校看做隶属于某一政府部门的事业单位，形成了高等学校对于政府部门的依附性。在这种体制下，对学生“统购包销”，学校用不着考虑“适销对路”，也用不着花费功夫去考虑社会的需要，主管部门要怎么办就怎么办，学校完全处于被动的地位。与其说学校在办学，不如说政府部门在办学。学校千校一面，万人一书，几乎是一个模子浇铸出来的。这种状况是与大一统的计划经济相配合的。这种体制，与商品经济的需要很不相适应。
    问题很明显，学校培养的人才要做到“适销对路”，学校就应当是独立的社会实体和法人，有充分的办学自主权，要保证学校有依法自主管理的权力，保护学校正当的办学权益。
    记者：在这方面，经济体制改革的经验是否也值得高等教育体制改革参考呢？
    李恩元：有人说，学校培养的是学生，与物的生产不一样，经济体制改革的经验难于借鉴。我不完全这样看。毫无疑问，二者是不相同的，但就高等学校作为生产、造就、培养高智力劳动者的产业部门而言，在产业属性上高校与企业就没有太多的本质上的差别。不论是培养人，还是生产产品，都需要社会、市场的认可，都要从对上级政府部门负责转到对社会经济的需求负责，都需要“适销对路”。从这个意义上讲，经济体制改革的经验，高等学校并非不能借鉴。
    记者：企业实行政、企分开，独立经营，是同承担风险联系在一起的。高校有了办学自主权，成为独立法人，也应当承担风险。您对这一点不知是怎样考虑的？
    李恩元：当然，学校要承担风险。我考虑过了，学校有了办学自主权，不一定就能办好学校。权力和风险是联系在一起的。在各个学校有了办学自主权以后，为了使自己培养的学生适应商品经济和科技发展，竞争就不可免了。伴随着竞争，出现“优胜劣汰”，风险就会接踵而来。学校就不能不时时考虑自身的适应能力，应变能力，竞争能力，考虑如何提高教学质量，提高学生素质，完善适应竞争的机制。这种危机感，正是学校教育改革的原动力。目前一些长线专业已处于被淘汰或改变专业方向的状态，一些社会急需的专业得到发展，正说明了这种变化。
    记者：在这种新的体制下，学生和教师的观念与行为也要与之相适应。
    李恩元：是的。商品经济的发展，不仅要求各类专业的学生掌握有关专业的科学技术，还要了解商品、市场，懂得技术决策、经营决策、产品决策，以至政策上的决策。学生学习的理论、知识日益要求多种学科的综合。必须改变僵化的计划经济体制反映在高等教育上形成的单一学科的培养模式，建立学科交叉综合培养模式，并要求学生具有相应的文化素养，在德、智、体、美几个方面得到全面发展，提高适应商品经济和科学技术发展的综合素质，具有较强的信息意识、竞争意识、应变意识、开拓和创新意识，一句话，就是要培养学生的自我适应能力。这种自我适应能力反映了学生的质量。为此，高等学校就不能不进行与之相应的改革，如办学方向、办学层次、专业设置、知识结构、培养模式、教学内容、教学方法、社会实践、学校管理、思想教育、教育评估等等，以力求建立学校自我调节、自我适应社会需求的机制，这样，学校才能存在和发展。要保证高质量的人才，学校对教师的要求、培养、待遇等，就不能不进行切实的改革。唯有这样，才能充分调动起学校教师、学生和管理干部的积极性和创造性。在竞争中，在适应社会需要中形成自己的风格和特色。从这一点说，风险就是动力。
    记者：这样一来，各校会不会偏重发展与当前经济联系紧、见效快的专业和学科，而一些从长远发展看非常需要，但见效慢的专业和学科被忽略？
    李恩元：这个问题是存在的，这也是我经常与教育同行们议论的话题。这个问题说明，与发展商品经济一样，需要有国家指令性计划。学校的培养计划应根据国家指令性计划和人才市场的需求来制订，恰当处理当前与长远需要的关系，避免教育上的短期行为。涉及到长远需要的新科学技术和基础理论研究的重要专业和学科，要用国家下达指令性计划来解决，大学校长必须保证完成指令性计划。
