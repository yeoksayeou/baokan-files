No one could have predicted that the 7th Session of the 2nd Meeting of the Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress would, during its closing session yesterday afternoon, encounter such a situation when discussing the qualifications of Wei Mingsheng, former Director of the Ankang Administrative Office and current Deputy Director of the Provincial Economic Commission, as a 7th National People's Congress representative. The voting result: Wei Mingsheng's resignation was not accepted, and the motion to remove him did not pass. This "banquet specialist" continues to serve as a National People's Congress representative.

In late March, the media publicly exposed the serious issue of Wei Mingsheng using his transfer as an opportunity to accept banquets and gifts from various places, which drew the attention of all sectors of society. The vast majority of representatives attending the provincial people's congress believed that, regardless of how one looks at it, Wei Mingsheng is no longer suitable to serve as a National People's Congress representative. Representatives from Ankang and Xianyang even submitted motions to remove him. The conference presidium decided to submit these two motions to the conference for discussion. At the same time, they reported to the representatives the more serious facts investigated by the National Supervision Department and the Shaanxi Provincial Government. Afterward, the conference presidium received responses indicating that most representatives agreed with the motion to remove him. In the face of the imminent removal, Wei Mingsheng hurriedly submitted a resignation letter of less than a hundred words to the conference on the day before its conclusion. The conference presidium, based on this new situation, proposed an amendment (draft) to accept Wei Mingsheng's request.

However, when the conference discussed this amendment, many representatives spoke out in opposition, sparking waves of applause. They believed that the representatives who proposed the motion to remove him had not withdrawn their proposal, and that the matter should not be trivialized just to save face for Wei Mingsheng. The results of the hand-raising vote naturally negated this amendment, and the motion to remove him was established. Finally, the motion to remove him was voted on using a secret ballot. Out of the 495 representatives present, 286 agreed to remove him, 77 disagreed, 126 abstained, and there were 6 invalid votes. Since the number of representatives agreeing to remove him did not exceed half of the total number of representatives, 611, the motion was not passed.

Wei Mingsheng's resignation was not accepted, and the motion to remove him did not pass. When the conference chair announced this result, the entire hall was in an uproar, and the representatives discussed it heatedly. Some representatives from Xi'an were puzzled, saying, "In such a solemn conference, for some unknown reason, more than 100 representatives were absent?" Some representatives from Ankang and Baoji sharply pointed out, "Wei Mingsheng is really insensitive. He should have expressed his attitude at the National People's Congress. Only when faced with the critical moment of 'the enemy at the gate' was he forced to submit a resignation request. Who knows what's going on here?" More representatives believed, "Accepting Wei Mingsheng's resignation request or passing the motion to remove him proposed by some representatives is just a difference in form; the essence of the problem is that he has long lost his qualifications to serve as a National People's Congress representative. Now, this 'banquet specialist' is still firmly seated in the representative's seat, which is really puzzling." Facing this outcome, the representatives who proposed the motion to remove him bluntly stated, "This may be the result that some people had anticipated and pursued!"

### 魏明生吃请受礼事实早已查清  陕西省人大罢免议案竟未通过  “吃喝专员”照当全国人大代表

　　魏明生吃请受礼事实早已查清    
    陕西省人大罢免议案竟未通过     
   “吃喝专员”照当全国人大代表
    本报西安５月１日电  新华社记者万武义、本报记者景险峰报道：没有人能料到，历时７天的陕西省七届二次人代会在昨天下午的闭幕会上，审议原安康行署专员、现省经委副主任魏明生七届全国人大代表资格时，会出现这样一种局面。投票结果：魏明生辞职未被接受，罢免议案又没有通过。这位“吃喝专员”仍然照当全国人大代表。
    ３月下旬，新闻界公开披露了魏明生借调离之机，四处吃请受礼的严重问题后，引起社会各界关注。这次参加省人代会的绝大多数代表认为，无论怎么说，魏明生也不适合再当全国人大代表了。安康、咸阳一些代表还分别提出了罢免议案。大会主席团决定将这两项罢免议案提交大会审议。同时，还把国家监察部和陕西省联合调查的、比新闻报道更为严重的事实材料通报代表。之后，大会主席团收到的反应是，大多数代表同意罢免议案。在罢免在即的态势下，魏明生匆忙于会议结束的前一天，向大会递交了不足百字的辞呈。大会主席团根据出现的这一新情况，又作出了接受魏明生请求的修正案（草案）。
    然而，当代表大会审议这一修正案时，不少代表当众发言表示反对，激起了阵阵掌声。他们认为，提出罢免议案的代表并未撤回，不能为了顾及魏明生的个人面子，而把大事化小、小事化了。举手表决结果，这个修正案理所当然被否定，罢免议案相应成立。最后，以无记名投票方式表决罢免议案。在到会的４９５名代表中，有２８６名同意罢免，７７票不同意，１２６票弃权，还有６张废票。由于同意罢免的未超过代表总数６１１名的半数，议案未被通过。
    魏明生辞职未被接受，罢免议案又没有通过。当大会主持人公布这一结果时，全场哗然，代表们议论纷纷。西安市一些代表不解地说：这么庄严的大会，不知何种缘故竟有１００多名代表缺席？安康、宝鸡的一些代表尖锐地指出：魏明生也太不知趣了，按说早在全国人代会上他就应表明自己的态度，直拖到“兵临城下”的关键时刻，才被迫提出辞职请求，这里面不知有什么名堂？更多的代表则认为：接受魏明生的辞职申请或通过部分代表提出的罢免议案，只是形式不同；问题的实质在于，他早已丧失了作全国人大代表的资格。眼下，这位“吃喝专员”仍然稳坐人大代表席位，实在叫人困惑。面对这一结局，提罢免议案的代表一针见血道：“这也许是某些人预想和追求的结果吧！”
