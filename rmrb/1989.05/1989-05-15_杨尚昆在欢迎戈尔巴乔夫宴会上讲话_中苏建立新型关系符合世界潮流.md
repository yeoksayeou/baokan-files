Yang Shangkun's Speech at the Welcome Banquet for Gorbachev
Establishing a New Type of Sino-Soviet Relations in Accordance with the World Trend

Respected Chairman Gorbachev and Madame Gorbachev:

First, please allow me to represent the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and in my personal capacity, to extend a warm welcome to Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee Gorbachev and Madame Gorbachev, as well as other Soviet dignitaries, on their official visit to our country.

China and the Soviet Union are neighboring countries with a long history of traditional friendship. Over the past decades, our relations have gone through a tortuous process. Today, we stand at a new starting point. Chairman Gorbachev's visit is the first meeting between the highest leaders of China and the Soviet Union in 30 years. In the coming days, you will meet with Chairman Deng Xiaoping and have talks and meetings with other Chinese leaders such as Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng. All of this will mark the normalization of relations between China and the Soviet Union.

In the long river of human history, 30 years is just a brief moment. However, the world and the situation in China and the Soviet Union have undergone tremendous changes. Humanity has entered a new historical period of maintaining peace and seeking development. Today, the two great neighboring countries of China and the Soviet Union are ending the past and opening up the future, exploring the establishment of a new type of relationship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is conducive to promoting this world trend and meets the requirements and aspirations of the peoples of China, the Soviet Union, and the world.

The historic meeting between our two leaders is hard-won. The progress already made needs to be cherished and maintained; the remaining issues need to be continuously resolved; and the broad prospects need our persistent efforts to strive for. We hope and believe that your visit will make an important contribution to solving the major problems between the two countries, thereby laying a good foundation for the long-term, stable, and healthy development of bilateral relations.

Chairman,

The relations between China and the Soviet Union are an important part of the overall international relations. Today, not only should Sino-Soviet relations be normalized, but the entire international relations should also be normalized and healthy. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence embody the essence of a new type of international relations and are universally applicable principles that have been tested by practice. We advocate that all countries, regardless of their wealth, size, strength, or differences in social systems, should handle their mutual relations according to these principles. The Chinese government believes that, due to the evolution and development of the post-war world situation, establishing a new international political order based on these principles is a common task facing the peoples of the world.

The Chinese people, who are dedicated to reform and modernization, need peace, love peace, and cherish peace. To this end, China will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, firmly oppose hegemony, and maintain the general principle of foreign policy to safeguard world peace. China is willing to establish, maintain, and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We believe that as long as the peoples of the world and all countries persist in joint efforts, they will gradually achieve the lofty goal of establishing a new international political order. The earth on which we depend for survival will become safer, more beautiful, and more prosperous day by day.

Chairman,

The development of China is part of the world's development. China was once a poor and backward semi-colonial country that was bullied, partitioned, enslaved, and plundered. In the 40 years since the founding of our People's Republic, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have done tremendous work for the development of their own country. Ten years ago, we embarked on the path of reform and opening up, and China's face has changed greatly. Although we will encounter difficulties and twists and turns on our way forward, we believe that as long as we adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party, adhere to the socialist road, adhere to the policy of reform and opening up, and constantly explore new paths, relying on the unity and struggle of the Chinese people, we will definitely overcome various difficulties, shake off poverty and backwardness, and achieve our expected goals.

The Chinese people have friendly feelings towards the Soviet people. Over the past 70 years, the Soviet people have, through their creative labor, brought about tremendous changes in the appearance of the Soviet state, and in recent years have embarked on a comprehensive reform process. The Chinese people are concerned about the reforms you are undertaking and hope for your success.

Chairman,

When our two leaders meet here, the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and the international community are all watching us. I believe that what they hope to see is a healthy new type of Sino-Soviet relations that will benefit the peoples of our two countries and promote world peace and stability. I also believe that as long as we both strive for this goal, we will definitely not disappoint the expectations of the peoples of China, the Soviet Union, and the world. I wish Chairman Gorbachev a successful visit to China!

I propose a toast:

To the normalization of relations between China and the Soviet Union,
To the health of Chairman Gorbachev and Madame Gorbachev, and to the health of all the comrades present,
Cheers!

　　杨尚昆在欢迎戈尔巴乔夫宴会上讲话    
    中苏建立新型关系符合世界潮流
    尊敬的戈尔巴乔夫主席和夫人：
    首先请允许我代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我个人名义对苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席、苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫同志和夫人以及其他苏联贵宾前来我国进行正式访问表示热烈欢迎。
    中苏两国是山水相连的近邻，两国人民有着传统的友谊。在过去的岁月中两国关系经历了曲折的历程，今天，我们走到了一个新的起点。戈尔巴乔夫主席的来访是３０年来中苏两国最高领导人之间的第一次见面。今后几天里，你将同邓小平主席会晤，也将同赵紫阳、李鹏等中国领导人会谈和会见。这一切将标志着中苏两国关系踏上正常化的道路。
    在人类历史的长河中，３０年只是短暂的一瞬。然而世界和中苏两国的情况都发生了巨大的变化。人类进入了一个维护和平和谋求发展的历史新时期。今天，中苏两大邻国结束过去，开辟未来，探讨在和平共处五项原则基础上建立新型关系，有利于促进这一世界潮流的发展，符合中苏两国和世界人民的要求和愿望。
    我们两国领导人能够进行历史性的会晤是来之不易的。已经取得的进展需要我们珍惜和维护；尚存的问题需要我们继续加以解决；广阔的前景需要我们作出坚持不懈的努力去争取。我们期望并且相信，你的访问应该和能够对于解决两国之间存在的重大问题作出重要贡献，从而为两国关系长期、稳定、健康的发展打下良好的基础。
    主席同志，
    中苏两国关系是整个国际关系的重要组成部分。今天，不仅中苏关系应该正常化，而且整个国际关系都应该正常化、健康化。和平共处五项原则体现了新型国际关系的本质，是经过实践考验的最富有生命力的普遍适用的国际关系准则。我们主张，世界各国，不论贫富、大小、强弱，不论社会制度的异同，都应该按照这些原则处理它们相互之间的关系。中国政府认为，由于战后世界形势的演变和发展，以这些原则为基础来建立国际政治新秩序，是世界各国人民面临的一项共同任务。
    正在一心一意致力于改革和现代化建设的中国人民需要和平，酷爱和平，珍视和平。为此，中国仍将坚定不移地奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，坚持反对霸权主义，维护世界和平的对外政策总方针。中国愿意在和平共处五项原则基础上同世界上所有国家建立、保持和发展友好合作关系。我们相信，只要世界各国人民和所有国家坚持不懈地共同努力，就能一步一步地实现建立国际政治新秩序这一崇高目标。我们赖以生存的地球就将变得一天比一天更安全、更美好、更繁荣。
  主席同志，
    中国的发展是世界发展的一部分。中国曾经是一个被人欺侮、瓜分、奴役和掠夺的贫穷落后的半殖民地国家。我们人民共和国诞生以来的４０年间，中国人民在中国共产党领导下，为了自己国家的发展进行了巨大的工作。十年前，我们走上了改革和开放的道路，中国的面貌发生了很大的变化。尽管在我们前进的道路上还会遇到困难和曲折，但是，我们相信，只要我们坚持共产党的领导，坚持社会主义道路，坚持改革和开放政策，不断进行新的探索，依靠我国人民的团结奋斗，就一定能排除各种困难，摆脱贫穷和落后，达到我们预期的目的。
    中国人民对苏联人民怀有友好的感情。７０多年来，苏联人民通过自己创造性的劳动，使苏维埃国家的面貌发生了巨大变化，近几年又开始了全面改革的历程。中国人民关注你们国家所进行的改革，并希望你们取得成功。
    主席同志，
    当我们两国领导人在这里相见的时候，中苏两国人民和国际社会都在注视着我们。我相信，他们希望看到的是一种既能造福于我们两国人民，又能促进世界和平与稳定的健康的新型中苏关系。我也相信，只要我们双方为此共同努力，就一定能够不辜负中苏两国人民和世界各国人民的期望。我预祝戈尔巴乔夫主席访华成功！
    我提议，请大家举杯，
    为中苏两国关系的正常化，
    为戈尔巴乔夫主席和夫人的健康和在座的同志们的健康，
    干杯！
