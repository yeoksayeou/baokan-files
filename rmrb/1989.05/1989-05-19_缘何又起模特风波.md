Humanity admires beauty, and the beauty of the human body is the epitome of beauty. The male form symbolizes the strength and integrity of humanity, while the female form embodies the purity of human nature. These profound meanings inspire awe in the viewer, uplifting the spirit and encouraging striving. Throughout world civilization, from ancient Greek nude sculptures like the Venus to the naked female figurines unearthed from the Neolithic period in Liaoxi, China, and Michelangelo's "David" during the Italian Renaissance of the 15th century, artists have used models to create artistic images. This demonstrates that the development of art can elevate a nation's culture. Therefore, art academies use human models as academic tools to study the structure, dynamic processes, and spiritual essence of the human body, expressing the great vitality of humanity. Anyone with a basic understanding of art history, both domestic and international, would understand this implicitly.

The profession of a model involves providing one's form and body to artists as a reference for their work. Artists (or schools) pay models a one-time fee to gain ownership of the artwork. The practice of using models for painting and creation has a history of several hundred years in Europe, and in Shanghai, where I founded an art school, this practice has continued for over seventy years. Even in the forty years since the founding of the People's Republic, this practice has been consistent, both domestically and internationally.

Half a century ago, I was accused by those in power of "harming public morality" for using human models and exhibiting human art. I was vilified by feudal literati and petty bourgeois as an "educational pest" and an "artistic traitor," among other insults, and was deemed "unforgivable." At that time, revolutionary literary giant Lu Xun, and prominent figures such as Cai Yuanpei, Huang Yanpei, Shen Enfu, and Wang Kunlun, stood up to support me, but I was still not spared from persecution. This was due to the darkness of society and the ignorance and backwardness of the populace, which are incomparable to today. It has since been proven that those who made the accusations have been nailed to the pillar of historical shame. Civilization has triumphed over ignorance.

I never expected that, more than fifty years later, in the reform and opening-up era of the 1980s, a controversy over models would arise again in our country. Models do not consider it an honor but rather a disgrace, even suing over it, which puzzles me. The root cause is that models are ridiculed and insulted by those who hold onto old societal views, leading to personal and reputational harm. The essence of this is deeply similar to what happened fifty years ago, to the point of astonishing me: First, those who directly harm models, causing personal and reputational damage, are above the law and have not been criticized or educated by the media; second, they have not been questioned by the judicial authorities. Instead, the artist's creative work has become the subject of the lawsuit, which is why I am so bewildered. Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese society has undergone tremendous changes, but the remnants of feudal morality still harm progressive culture, endanger the development of Chinese art, and obstruct academic progress. Although defaming scholars' personalities is a minor matter, the repercussions extend globally, bringing shame to the nation. Although I am old and nearing a hundred, I still harbor concerns and dare to appeal to all parties to carefully consider this matter.

　　缘何又起模特风波
    刘海粟
    人类崇尚美，人体美乃美中之至美，盖以男体象征人类刚毅之节概，女体象征人类纯洁之天性。命意深长，令观者肃然起敬，上感神明，下图奋励。世界文明史，如古希腊裸体雕像维纳斯等，中国新石器时期之辽西牛河梁出土的陶裸体女像等，意大利十五世纪文艺复兴时米开朗基罗之《大卫》等皆为艺术家借助模特儿创造出艺术形象为标志。昭示来兹，盖艺术发达足以提高国家文化。故美术院校以人体模特儿为学术公器，审察人体之构造，生动之历程，精神之体相，表现人类之伟大生命力。凡对中外美术史稍有涉猎者即不言自明。
    模特儿之为职业，即以自身之形、体提供画家做为原形进行画作。画家（或学校）通过付给模特儿一次性报酬，而获得作品之所有权。欧洲画模特儿写生与创作数百年而来之历史，自我在上海创办美术学校至今七十多年之历史，建国以来四十年之历史皆然，中外皆然。
    半个世纪前，我曾因使用人体模特儿和展示人体艺术而遭当权者指控为“有伤风化”，被封建文人和市侩辱骂为“教育蟊贼”、“艺术叛徒”等等，“非严惩不可”。而当时革命文豪鲁迅，社会贤达蔡元培、黄炎培、沈恩孚、王昆仑等愤起声援，而吾犹未能幸免于迫害者，是因社会之黑暗、民俗之愚昧落后，实不可同日而语。现已证明指控者已被钉在了历史的耻辱柱上。文明战胜了愚昧。
    吾殊未能料及者，事过五十余年，八十年代改革开放的今天，国内又起模特儿之风波，模特儿不以为荣，反以为耻，乃至起诉，实令吾费解，究其因，为模特儿受社会环境之持旧观念者所嘲讽、辱骂，人身、名誉受辱所至。其实质与五十年前有深刻地相同相通之处，至乃使我大为惊讶者：一则是直接施虐于模特儿的人，致使人身、名誉受损，而超然法外未受新闻舆论批评教育；二则至今未被司法当局问讯；倒是画家的艺术创作成了被诉讼之事由，是粟所以大惑不解者。中国自“五四”运动而今，社会已发生巨大变化，而封建道德之遗毒，至今仍能如此加害于进步文化，危及中国的艺术发展，阻梗学术之进程。虽然谤毁学者之人格，其事尚小，但风声所及，腾笑世界，实为国家之耻。海粟虽已老耄近百，但犹怀忧思，敢于此吁请各方，当审慎析之。
