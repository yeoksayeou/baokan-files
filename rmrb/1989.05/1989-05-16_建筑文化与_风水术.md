What kind of model should Chinese architectural culture adopt? What is the effective remedy for the predicament of architectural art? As Chinese architects tirelessly seek answers to these questions, some newspapers have spread the following news:

"Long considered a feudal superstition by the public, ancient Chinese feng shui is now being introduced into architectural design by a renowned (?) architectural theory expert, Professor Xxxxx. 'Feng shui is an ancient Chinese theory regarding the selection and planning of urban, village, and residential building environments.' It is 'an ancient architectural planning and design theory that integrates geology, ecology, landscape architecture, architecture, ethics, and aesthetics. It, along with the theory of construction and garden design, forms the three pillars of ancient Chinese architectural theory.' Because feng shui has long been considered a feudal superstition and thus prohibited from spreading, this excellent cultural heritage has almost been lost in China. Professor Xxxxx asserts that the re-evaluation and application of this ancient culture will further promote the development of Chinese architecture and bring blessings to urban and rural residents."

It must be acknowledged that there is a distorted mindset in China's current culture. Valuable academic works and practical technical books that are urgently needed for modernization are difficult to publish, but trivial novels and fortune-telling and palmistry books are being mass-produced. Meanwhile, the emergence of trends such as advocating empty talk, delving into ancient architectural theories, and pseudo-science in architectural culture is also a result of the so-called "New Confucianism." What about "commercial signboards and feng shui appraisal," "judging the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of a signboard from the business owner's birth year, month, and day and the type of industry they are in," "a piece of land an inch wide can kill a person, and a stream of water can bring wealth"? These so-called basic theories of architectural design were ridiculed even before liberation. Who would have thought that in the computer age, the dregs discarded by society decades ago would be "legitimized" by a "new star professor" in a certain university and solemnly included in the "basic theories of architectural design"? A group of vagabonds who often stir up disputes over homestead sites (fighting for "good feng shui") in rural areas for the sake of money have suddenly become the founders of architectural culture. I have never thought that "feng shui" is not worth studying, especially as a phenomenon of ancient Chinese culture, it should be analyzed. Some architectural theorists have already published insightful views on this research. But the research by the "new star" mentioned above, the "feng shui" he advocates, which can "turn misfortune into good luck and make everything go smoothly," is really difficult to associate with architectural science. I don't know how to apply "Azure Dragon and White Tiger" and "Vermilion Bird and Black Tortoise" in new urban planning, nor do I know how to use "feng shui" theory in community planning, commercial center building groups, and how to use "feng shui" for the structural planning of large cities. An editor of a certain publishing house said: "'Feng shui' is like qigong, a hot topic at the moment. A book on feng shui and the Eight Trigrams has a high order number, of course, it must be published." This reminds me of the scene when the "chicken blood therapy" was once sensational. It is sad that in a country with more than 200 million illiterates, do we not have better cultural guidance? The more prevalent pseudo-science is, the more devalued instrumental theory culture (science and technology) becomes, the more it exacerbates the malnutrition of Chinese culture. Especially these pseudo-sciences, with their "mysterious," "abstract," and "enigmatic" seemingly obscure and alluring words, can easily attract some young people who do not understand the laws of national economic construction and urban architectural development. When the "feng shui" whirlwind is raging in a certain academic circle, some enlightened people worry: The next most fashionable and "weighty" academic research will be "shamanism." This is also a national treasure, who knows if it can be proven: "Shamanism is a powerful means for ancient Chinese people to fight against heaven and invigorate their spirits."

China needs more down-to-earth scholars to do things beneficial to socialist construction. As long as it is beneficial to the development of architectural culture, even if it is just introducing some practical materials, it is better than spreading a dozen pseudo-scientific theories.

　　建筑文化与“风水术”
    李雄飞
    中国建筑文化究竟取何种模式？什么是可以拯救建筑艺术困境的良方？正当我国建筑师孜孜不倦地探求这些问题的时候，有的报刊传播着这样一条消息：
    “长期被人们视为封建迷信的中国古代风水术，如今被我国著名（？）建筑理论专家×××教授（？）引入建筑设计。”“风水术是我国古代的一种有关都市、村镇、住宅等建筑环境的基址选择与规划设计的理论”。它是“集地质地理学、生态学、景观学、建筑学、伦理学、美学等多种学科于一体的古代建筑规划、设计理论，它与营造学、造园学构成了中国古代建筑理论的三大支柱”。“由于风水术一直被视为封建迷信而禁止传播，这一古代优秀文化遗产在国内几乎失传，×××教授断言，这一古代文化的重新论证和应用，必将进一步推动我国建筑学发展，并为广大城乡居民安居乐业带来福音。”
    应当承认，我国目前文化上出现了畸形的扭曲心态。大批有价值的学术著述，对现代化当务之急有价值的实用技术书籍难于出版，但无聊小说和算命、手相书籍却在大量印行。与此同时，建筑文化中出现的崇尚空谈风、钻故纸堆寻古代建筑理论风、伪科学风，也是所谓“新儒学”引导的结果。什么要对“商品招牌，风水鉴定”、“招牌的吉凶要从业主的出生年、月、日之命运与其所从事的行业类别两方面来判断”、“一寸之土能杀人，一脉之水能致富”……这些所谓建筑设计基础理论，就是在解放前也是被人嗤之以鼻的。谁能料到，在计算机时代，几十年前已被社会抛弃的沉渣，竟会在某高等学府被“教授新秀”所“正名”，堂而皇之地划进“建筑设计的基础理论”。一批以骗钱为业在农村经常挑起宅基地纠纷（争“好风水”）的无业游民，一夜之间竟成了建筑文化的奠基者。我从来不认为“风水”不值得研究，特别是作为中国古代文化现象更应进行分析，已有建筑理论学者对这项研究发表了精辟的见解。但像上面所举的“新秀”研究，他所倡导的那种可以“逢凶化吉、事事顺利”的“风水术”，实在很难和建筑科学连在一起。我不知道“青龙白虎”“朱雀玄武”该如何在新城市规划中应用，也无法知道小区规划、商业中心建筑群怎样运用“风水术”理论，以及如何运用“风水术”进行大城市的结构规划。某位出版社的编辑说：“‘风水术’像气功一样，是当前热门话题，一本风水与八卦的书订数很高，当然要出版了。”这颇使人想起“鸡血疗法”曾轰动一时的情景。可悲的是，在还有二亿多文盲的国家里，难道我们就没有更好的文化引导了吗？伪科学之风愈盛，工具理论文化（科学技术）愈贬值，就愈益加剧中国文化的营养不良。特别是这些伪科学以其“玄奥”、“抽象”、“神秘”，似乎朦胧而诱人的言辞，很容易吸引一些不了解国家经济建设和城市建筑发展规律的年轻人。当“风水术”旋风在某地学术界喧嚣之时，一些有识之士忧心忡忡地说：下一步最时髦而“有分量的学术研究”，该是“跳大神”了。这也是国粹，说不定能考证出来：“跳大神是中国古代人民振奋精神与天奋斗的有力手段”。
    中国需要更多的踏踏实实的学者，作一些对社会主义建设有益的事情。只要对发展建筑文化有利，哪怕是介绍一点切实的资料，也比散布一打伪科学理论强上十倍。
