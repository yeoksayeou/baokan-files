People's Daily, Bangkok, May 7th.

To ensure that forest resources are no longer damaged, the Thai House of Representatives passed a forest conservation law late last night. The law cancels all logging concessions nationwide and prohibits anyone from felling trees.

This law was proposed after a severe flood in southern Thailand last November, which was caused by excessive logging.

Thai Prime Minister Chatichai yesterday commented on the forest conservation law, saying, "Forests are an extremely important resource. The government's goal is to preserve the forests. The forest conservation law does not prohibit people from entering the forests, but it absolutely prohibits logging. For those who previously held logging concessions, the government is prepared to compensate for their losses."

The passage of the forest conservation law has been widely supported by the public. According to reports, yesterday about 2,000 people from all over the country gathered in front of the parliament to support the passage of the forest conservation law.

　　为保护森林禁止一切砍伐    
    泰国通过封林法
    本报曼谷５月７日电  记者刘爱成报道：为了确保森林资源不再遭到破坏，泰国下议院４日晚通过一项封林法案。在全国范围内取消伐木专利权，禁止任何人砍伐林木。
    这项法案是在去年１１月泰国南部由于滥伐森林而造成特大水灾之后提出的。
    泰国总理差猜昨天就封林法案发表谈话说，“森林是极重要的资源，政府的目的是要保存森林。封林法并不禁止人民进入森林，但绝对禁止砍伐树林。对于过去拥有伐木专利者，政府准备对他们的损失提供补偿。”
    封林法案的通过受到了人民群众的拥护。据报道，昨天约有２０００多来自全国各地的民众聚集在国会前，支持议会通过封林法。
