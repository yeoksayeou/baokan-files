The "Ceramics Road" exhibition opened in Beijing. Thousands of years ago, a portion of Chinese ceramics that were exported overseas and renowned worldwide have "returned home" to meet with the Chinese people. The exhibition, jointly organized by the Idemitsu Museum of Arts in Japan and the Palace Museum in China, once again demonstrates the historical circumstances of ancient East-West communication and cultural exchange.

The exhibition showcases 175 pieces of ceramic artifacts primarily produced in China from the collection of the Idemitsu Museum of Arts. These are displayed alongside Japanese ceramics and 17th and 18th-century European and Middle Eastern imitations. The exhibition compares the mutual influences of Eastern and Western ancient ceramics in terms of shape, glaze, and patterns, providing important material evidence for the study of ancient ceramic exchanges between the East and West.
