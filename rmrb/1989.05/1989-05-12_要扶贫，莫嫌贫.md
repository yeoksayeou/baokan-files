Agricultural science and technology personnel going to the countryside to engage in scientific and technological assistance is a highly welcomed initiative by the farmers. However, it is understood that currently, most of the science and technology personnel who go down to the countryside tend to flock to areas with better basic conditions, while places with poor conditions and many difficulties are often neglected.

The development of agriculture cannot do without scientific and technological input, and scientific and technological assistance is particularly urgent. The more remote, closed, and impoverished a place is, the more it needs the popularization and promotion of science and technology. Indeed, there are many practical difficulties in implementing contracts in poor and remote areas, such as low farmer literacy, poor natural conditions, and difficulties in realizing science and technology contract fees. However, precisely because of this, science and technology personnel can play a greater role and more easily experience the hardships and joys of pioneers. Walking on a wide road is certainly easy, but opening up a wide road in a place where there is no road requires entrepreneurial courage, vision, and a spirit of sacrifice.

Adding flowers to brocade is certainly commendable, but sending charcoal in the snow is even more precious. Farmers in old, minority, border, and poor regions are eagerly awaiting the arrival of science and technology personnel and also hope that relevant leading agencies will formulate policies to encourage science and technology personnel to go there.

### 要扶贫，莫嫌贫

　　要扶贫，莫嫌贫
    吴东林
    农业科技人员到乡下搞科技扶贫，是颇受农民欢迎的大好事。但据了解，目前下乡的科技人员大都涌到基础条件较好的乡、村，条件差、困难多的地方则“门前冷落车马稀”。
    农业的发展离不开科技投入，科技扶贫更是迫在眉睫。因为越是偏僻闭塞、贫穷落后的地方，就越需要科学技术的普及和推广。诚然，在穷乡僻壤搞承包有很多实际困难，如农民素质低、自然条件差、科技承包费兑现难等，而唯其如此，科技人员才能派上更大的用场，才更易体会到开拓者的苦和乐。在宽阔的大道上走当然容易，而在没有道路的地方开拓出宽阔的大道来则需要有创业的勇气、胆识和牺牲精神。
    锦上添花固然可喜，雪中送炭更为难得。老少边穷地区的农民期待科技人员早日光临，也希望有关领导机关制定政策鼓励科技人员到那里去。
