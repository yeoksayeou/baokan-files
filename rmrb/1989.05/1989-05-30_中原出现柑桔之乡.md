    The central plains have seen the emergence of a citrus county. After years of "moving citrus northwards" experiments, the banks of the Guan River in Gushi County, Henan Province, have become the first citrus county in the central plains.
    Over 100 years ago, people in the village of Yinghe began experimenting with citrus cultivation. After liberation, the "moving citrus northwards" experiments expanded. According to incomplete statistics from four townships in Gushi County, there are now approximately 50,000 citrus trees.
    It is understood that, in addition to Gushi County, experiments in moving citrus northwards are also being conducted in Xin County, Shangcheng, and Xinyang in the Xinyang region, and all have been successful.

    中原出现柑桔之乡
    据新华社郑州5月30日电  （记者刘云莱）经多年“南桔北移”的种植试验，河南省固始县沿灌河两岸出现了中原第一个柑桔之乡。
    早在100多年前，这里的迎河村就有人试种柑桔，解放后“南桔北移”的试验开始扩展。据固始县四个乡的不完全统计，现有桔树约五万多棵。
    据了解，目前，除固始县外，在信阳地区的新县、商城、信阳等县都有南桔北移的试验，并且都获得了成功。
