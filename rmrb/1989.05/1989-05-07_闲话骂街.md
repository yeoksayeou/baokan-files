Some people's mouths are constantly filled with dirty words, swearing freely, which is quite shocking. Certain works of art, not only in dialogue, but even in narrative text, often include swearing. As for on the streets, a few youngsters who haven't seen each other for days use swearing to express affection, which is quite common.

Swearing is naturally uncivilized, but sometimes it has little direct relationship with one's cultural level. Lin Yutang said: "Insulting others is originally a very vulgar thing, but in our Chinese language, very coarse and unpleasant words still come out of the mouths of our elders and superiors without any hesitation." Lu Xun, on the other hand, believed: "In fact, among the good workers and peasants, there are not many who swear freely." An old farmer strongly opposed swearing, saying that nowadays some young people "always use dirty words when they speak, which is very uncivilized."

Recently, some newspapers have continuously reported on the issue of "eating meat and swearing." Those who swear include those who feel they have been wronged and did not get enough advantage; some are dissatisfied with certain corrupt or unfair phenomena as well as the rapid increase in prices. As decision-making departments, it is not inappropriate to sense some public sentiment from swearing and understand what opinions the masses have, in order to improve work; but as swearing individuals, I think it is better not to swear. If you have something to say, just say it. If you have opinions, just express them. In an era where the people are the masters, there are many channels to reflect one's opinions, so why insist on swearing? From another perspective, swearing only shows a lack of education. Our ancestors created a beautiful and colorful language for the purpose of exchanging thoughts and feelings, and spreading information. Using obscene language is indeed a desecration of the beautiful language created by our ancestors and is an uncivilized behavior.

Therefore, the author believes that whether in daily language or in discussing national affairs, we should not forget "language hygiene."

　　闲话骂街
    丁悦陶
    某些人的嘴里脏话不断，随便骂街，十分惊人。某些文艺作品，不仅对话，就是在叙述性的文字中，也常把骂街的脏话写进去。至于在大街上，几个小青年多日不见，用骂街表示亲热，更是司空见惯。
    骂街自然不文明，但有时和文化水平并无太直接的关系。林语堂说：“骂人原本是极其粗鄙的事，可是在我们中国语言里面，很粗浊难听的话仍然出于我们尊辈长上之口，并无顾忌。”鲁迅则认为：“其实好的工农之中，并不随口骂人的多得很。”一位老农就很反对骂街，他说现在有的青年人“张口说话总要带脏字，太不文明。”
    不久前，有的报纸曾连续报道“吃肉骂娘”的问题。“骂娘”的人中有的是觉得自己吃了亏，没有多占便宜；有的是对某些腐败或不公平现象以及物价上涨过快表示不满。作为决策部门，当然不妨从骂街中体察一点民情，了解群众有什么意见，以便改进工作；但作为骂街者自己，我以为骂不如不骂。有话就说，有意见就提。人民当家作主的时代，有许多渠道可以反映自己的意见，为什么定要骂街呢？从另一方面说，骂街只能说明自己缺乏教养。我们的祖先创造了优美、多彩的语言，为的是交流思想感情，传播信息。专门使用污言秽语，实在是对祖先创造的优美语言的一种亵渎，是不文明的表现。
    因此，笔者认为，小至日常用语，大至议论国是，我们都不应忘记“语言卫生”。
