Title: The Three Marvels of Shaolin

I have visited many famous mountains and ancient temples. At the invitation of a friend, I went to Shaolin. Apart from wanting to pay my respects to the founder of Zen Buddhism and to see the pagoda forest, I had no other interests. Little did I expect that a wall, a pavilion, and a pit here would deeply engrave themselves in my increasingly numb mind.

Wall

I have always hated walls. They block you, separate you, surround you, confine you, and even hit you. So, I avoid walls as much as possible.

I did not go to see the Nine-Dragon Wall in Beihai, which is said to have living dragons; nor did I go to the Echo Wall in the Temple of Heaven, which is said to allow mutual conversation; I only approached the Great Wall a few times and even climbed to the top of the high wall. But recently, I heard that the Great Wall is partly responsible for China's backwardness, so I will not climb it again. However, the cold stone wall in the Damo Cave at Shaolin attracted me like a magnet.

It is said that this is the wall where the first patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Bodhidharma, sat in meditation for 10 years (or 9 years according to another account). I stood quietly in front of the wall, and my mind was filled with thoughts: In this damp and cold natural stone cave, it would be uncomfortable to sit cross-legged for 10 years, let alone 10 months, 10 days, or even 10 hours. I decided to sit here for 10 minutes to experience Bodhidharma's mental activities 1,400 years ago. However, visitors found me obstructive, and my friends pulled me away. I hated the wall I could not avoid and loved the wall I could not approach. It was unreasonable!

Later, at home, I pushed my writing desk into a row of bookshelves against the wall, leaving a small wall in front. Every day, I sit facing the wall. Although I cannot "enter the wall with my heart," it helps me to see my true nature and enlighten my mind. It's just a pity that the wall is plastered with white lime. I am looking for a thick, dark green, and cool stone slab to embed in it...

Pavilion

I have always loved pavilions. I love that they have no walls on four sides, are well-ventilated, and allow for free breathing.

The Lan Pavilion in Shaoxing, the Stele Pavilion in Xi'an, the Copper Pavilion on Wanshou Mountain, and the unnamed thatched pavilion in my hometown of Ma'er Temple have all made me sit down and forget to stand up.

But the Lishuei Pavilion in Shaolin gave me a sense of oppression. Although it is called a pavilion, it is actually a small hall with a heavy roof in the form of a gabled building. The name "Lishuei" makes my back cold.

It is said that this is where the second patriarch of Zen Buddhism, Hui Ke, stood before the first patriarch, Bodhidharma. He stood under the frozen clouds, stood on the snow-covered ground, and stood motionless even when the snow was knee-deep. Imagining the demeanor of this master and disciple is indeed interesting: one sat steadfastly, and the other stood firmly. The one who sat steadfastly finally handed over the robe, the Dharma, and even his heart to the one who stood firmly.

Thus, this pavilion also made me dare not look at it sideways. But I do not want to learn the action of standing in the snow. Standing in the snow with empty hands, I am afraid I will just freeze in vain.

Pit

There is a pit on the brick-paved ground of the Vairochana Hall. It is said that this is the footprint pit left by Shaolin monks practicing martial arts, known as the "standing post" pit of Shaolin boxing.

A Northeasterner speaking in Northeastern dialect would say, "Good God, can human feet stand out pits on brick ground? Nonsense!"

Looking closely at the bricks, they are solid and not like today's shoddy products that break easily; looking at the pits, they are naturally smooth with no signs of carving, and they do not look like the result of exaggerating flowery fists and legs to falsely report achievements.

I couldn't help but mutter to myself, "It seems I have wronged..." Before the words "ancient people" could come out, the 500 Luohan in the murals seemed to glare at me in unison; the pit seemed to stand up a group of vigorous and resolute Shaolin monks, making me feel as if I were facing the tall, straight red pine forest in my hometown!

Farewell to Shaolin. That wall, that pavilion, that pit, weighed heavily on my heart, making the car hum incessantly. Outside the car window, the setting sun was cold and lonely, the evening wind was chilling, and the old trees by the roadside were retreating one by one... Suddenly, my eyes lit up, and I saw a little girl with a red scarf high-kicking on a tree trunk, motionless, as if she were sitting in meditation, standing in the snow, and standing in the post...

　　少林三绝
    王肯
    名山古刹访过不少。应朋友之邀到少林，除想拜拜禅宗之祖再看看塔林，别无他趣。谁料这里的一堵墙，一座亭，一片坑，却深深镂刻在我日见麻木的头脑中。
    墙
    平生最恨墙。它挡你隔你围你困你，还要撞你。于是见墙就躲得远远的。
    那本无活龙却说得活现的北海九龙壁，不去看；那奇妙的可相互通话的天坛回音壁，耳聋，不聋也不去听；唯有长城靠近几回，还几番登上高高的大墙之顶。但近来听说中国落后它负有一定的责任，今后再也不登了。倒是少林达摩洞中那面阴冷的石壁，磁石般地粘住了我。
    据说这就是禅宗初祖达摩面壁１０年（一说９年）寂坐修心的那堵墙，我静立壁前，顿生杂念：在这又湿又凉的天然小石洞中，慢说盘膝静坐１０年，就是坐１０月，坐１０天，坐１０小时，纵不叫苦也不会感到舒服。我决心在这里静坐１０分钟，也好体验体验１４００多年前达摩的心灵活动。谁料游人嫌我碍事，友人拉我快走，恨的墙躲不开，爱的墙靠不近，不讲理！
    后来回家把写字台塞进靠墙的一排书架中，留出小墙一面。每日面壁而坐，纵不能“心入墙壁”，也有助于见性明心。只可惜那墙是白灰喷过的，我正在寻找一块浓碧阴凉的石板，镶嵌进去……
    亭
    我一向喜爱亭。爱它四面无墙，通风良好，出气自由。
    绍兴的兰亭，西安的碑亭，万寿山上的铜亭和我家乡茅儿寺不知名的小茅亭，都曾使我坐下就忘记站起。
    但，少林的立雪亭却使我产生压抑感。名曰亭，其实是一座屋顶沉重的庑殿式小殿堂。亭名“立雪”，更令人脊背发冷。
    相传这是禅宗二祖立侯初祖达摩的地方。他头顶冻云站立着，脚踏雪地站立着，雪深过膝依然一动不动地站立着。遥想这师徒的神态倒真有意思：一位坐得稳，一位站得牢，坐得稳的终于把衣钵法器包括那颗心交给站得牢的。
    于是这亭也使我不敢侧目视之了。但那立雪的动作可不想学。两手空空站在雪中，只怕白白挨冻。
    坑
    毗卢殿砖铺地面上有小坑一片。都说这是少林僧人练拳习武的脚坑遗迹，叫做少林拳“站桩”坑。
    东北人用东北话说“好凿死铆子”：“人脚能把砖地站出坑来？扯！”
    细看那砖，质地坚实，不像今日那种偷工减料一碰就出坑的次品；再看那坑，自然平滑不见雕琢痕迹，更不像为了虚夸花拳绣脚而谎报成绩的产物。
    我不禁自言自语：“看来是我冤枉了……”没等“古人”二字出口，那壁画上５００罗汉好像齐刷刷对我怒目而视；那一片坑好像齐刷刷站起一群英武刚毅的少林僧人，使我如同面对家乡那齐刷刷一大片原始红松林！
    告别少林。那墙，那亭，那坑，重重地压在心头，压得汽车哼哼不止。车窗外，残照冷落，晚风凄紧，路旁老树纷纷倒退……突然眼前一亮，见一红领巾小脚高蹬在树干上压腿，一动不动，仿佛一动不动地在那面壁，立雪，站桩……
