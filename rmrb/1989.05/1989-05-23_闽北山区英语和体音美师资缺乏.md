Our county has 10 middle schools and 385 primary schools, with a total of 1,304 classes and 34,837 students. However, the entire county has only 63 full-time teachers specializing in English, physical education, music, and art, with less than one-third of them holding a bachelor's degree. In the five impoverished townships, four are without music and art teachers, and two have yet to have English and physical education teachers, making it impossible to offer these courses.

The main reasons for this situation are:

1. Insufficient allocation of teachers: Since 1985, only 14 English, physical education, music, and art teachers have been allocated to our county, which can only be used to strengthen key middle schools, leaving other middle and primary schools without proper arrangements.

2. Limited sending of teachers: Statistics show that from 1986 to the present, only 8 people from our county have been admitted to specialized colleges for English, physical education, music, and art. Due to a lack of funds, the work of entrusting specialized colleges to train teachers has also been difficult to implement.

3. Difficulty in attracting teachers: Our county is located in a remote mountainous area with poor living conditions and teaching facilities, making it unattractive for teachers to work here. Some teachers working in the county are not content with their jobs, and a few have left, further exacerbating the shortage of teachers.

The severe shortage of English, physical education, music, and art teachers in mountainous areas means that some schools, while having these subjects on their timetables, actually teach language and mathematics or simply have students study independently. This seriously affects the students' comprehensive development in terms of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics. We appeal to relevant departments to pay attention to and solve this problem, and we also hope that more specialized teachers in English, physical education, music, and art will be willing to come to the mountainous areas to build and achieve.

### 闽北山区英语和体音美师资缺乏

　　闽北山区英语和体音美师资缺乏
    我县共有１０所中学，３８５所小学，共１３０４个班级，在校学生３４８３７人，而全县英语、体育、音乐、美术课专职教师只有６３人，其中大学本科毕业的不到１／３。全县５个贫困乡就有４个乡缺音乐、美术教师，其中两个乡至今没有英语、体育教师，这些课程也无法开设。
    造成这种状况的主要原因是：
    一、师资分配少。１９８５年以来，分配到我县的英、体、音、美教师只有１４人，只能充实重点中学，其他中小学无法安排。
    二、输送少。据统计，１９８６年至今，全县考取英、体、音、美专科学校的仅８人。因经费缺乏，委托专科院校代培师资的工作也难落实。
    三、引进难。我县因地处偏僻山区，生活待遇、教学条件较差，教师不愿来这里工作。在县里工作的一些老师不安心执教，少数外流，以致师资力量更加缺乏。
    山区英语和体、音、美教师严重不足，有些学校课程表上虽然排的是英语、体育、音乐、美术课，但上的是语文和数学课，或者干脆让学生们自习，严重影响了学生德、智、体、美的全面发展。呼吁有关部门重视和解决这一问题，也盼望有更多的英语和体、音、美专科的教师踊跃到山区来建功立业。
