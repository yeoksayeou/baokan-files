The Shanghai Railway Bureau is vigorously promoting a range of sports activities among its employees, focusing on football, basketball, badminton, table tennis, gateball, chess, bridge, and medical qigong. The bureau has established over 500 sports associations, implementing a three-tier management system at the bureau, division, and station levels. Currently, 48% of the employees regularly participate in group and small-scale competitions.

The leadership of the Shanghai Railway Bureau places great importance on mass sports activities. They have repeatedly emphasized that since our bureau ranks among the top in profit contributions within the national railway system, our employee sports should not lag behind. At present, the bureau has a well-equipped locomotive sports stadium, two gymnasiums, three outdoor illuminated courts, and three swimming pools. Recently, the bureau has invested over 200 million yuan to build gymnasiums in several divisions. These investments have created excellent material conditions for the development of employee sports activities.

    上海铁路局职工体育蓬勃开展
    本报讯  一个以足、篮、羽毛、乒乓和门球以及棋类、桥牌和医疗气功等活动为主的职工体育正在上海铁路局蓬勃开展。这个铁路局已建立了五百多个体育协会，路局、分局、站段实行体协三级管理制。全局现有百分之四十八的职工经常参加群体和小型竞赛活动。
    上海铁路局领导对群众性体育活动十分重视，他们多次强调：我们局上缴利润在全国铁路系统名列前茅，职工体育也不能落后。目前，全局已拥有一座设备较好的火车头体育场，还有两个体育馆和三个室外灯光球场以及三个游泳池。最近，局里又投资二百余万元在几个分局筹建体育馆。这些都为职工体育活动的开展创造了良好的物质条件。
