Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 28th.

Leaders of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, as well as the Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, have separately expressed their firm support for the decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Six major industrial enterprises have also written to the central authorities.

Leaders of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate have issued statements expressing their firm support for the central authorities' decisions and their commitment to fulfilling their duties to maintain social stability.

The statement from the Supreme People's Court is as follows:

"In recent times, the People's Liberation Army, public security officers, armed police, and various sectors of society have made tireless efforts to stop the turmoil and maintain stability. We extend our respect and gratitude to the troops, public security officers, and armed police who have been tasked with maintaining order in parts of Beijing. We also express our thanks to the officials and workers of government agencies, factories, shops, and enterprises who have been working day and night to maintain the normal functioning of the capital and ensure the smooth operation of social life.

"The situation in Beijing has shown that a small number of people have exploited the patriotic fervor of the students to create turmoil. If the situation is not quickly reversed and stabilized, it could lead to widespread chaos across the country. To stop the turmoil, restore order in the capital, protect key facilities and public property from damage, and safeguard the lives and property of the people, Comrade Li Peng announced the major decision of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Comrade Yang Shangkun delivered an important speech. We fully support this. The State Council's decision to impose martial law in parts of Beijing is in accordance with Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution, and is legal and correct. The People's Liberation Army, upon orders, has come to Beijing to carry out martial law duties, which is in the interests of the broad masses of the people and is absolutely necessary. Our courts will seriously fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to us by the Constitution and the law, and fully play our judicial role. We will resolutely and severely punish, in accordance with the law, the ringleaders who take advantage of the situation to disrupt social order and public security, and those who engage in looting, arson, and other criminal activities, and strive to make our due contributions to maintaining order and stabilizing the situation.

"We have seen that the broad masses of young students, out of patriotic fervor, demand the punishment of corruption, bribery, and 'official profiteering,' which is in line with the goals that the Party and the government are striving to achieve. This is also an important task for our courts. Over the years, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the supervision of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee, we have consistently adhered to the principle of severely punishing, in accordance with the law, various serious criminal activities that endanger social order and various serious economic crimes. In 1988, courts across the country concluded 55,710 economic crime cases, sentencing 74,923 defendants. Among them, 8,428 defendants were sentenced for embezzlement, 1,584 for bribery, 1,699 for speculation, and 198 for smuggling. In the first quarter of this year, the courts accepted 15,787 economic crime cases. On February 20, the Supreme People's Court issued a notice requiring all levels of courts to strictly punish, in accordance with the law, serious economic crimes, especially embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and smuggling. On March 15, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate jointly issued the 'Regulations on Handling Current Cases of Speculation by Enterprises, Institutions, Government Agencies, and Mass Organizations,' providing important judicial interpretations on the legal issues related to the punishment of 'official profiteering' that society is concerned about, and reported the relevant situation to the public through the media. In early May, we held a meeting of the presidents of high courts across the country, further deploying the severe punishment of serious criminal activities that endanger social order and serious economic crimes. At the same time, we held a national court anti-corruption work conference, proposing clear requirements for court personnel to reject corruption, maintain integrity, and uphold justice. The spirit of these two conferences is currently being earnestly implemented by courts at all levels.

"To ensure the smooth progress of rectification and deepening of reforms, we welcome the broad masses of the people and the patriotic students to expose and report economic criminal activities, especially serious crimes such as embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and smuggling. The courts will handle these cases in accordance with legal procedures and will protect, in accordance with the law, those who report such crimes, ensuring that they are not harmed. For cases brought to the courts, we will adhere to the constitutional principle of equality before the law and handle them strictly in accordance with the law. For such cases, we will adhere to open trials and public sentencing, placing the court's judicial activities under the supervision of the broad masses of the people. We sincerely hope that the broad masses of the people and the patriotic students will support us and resolutely fight against serious criminals such as embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and smuggling.

"Everyone knows that our modernization drive and reform and opening up depend on stability. Without stability, nothing can be accomplished. Reform and opening up, democracy and the legal system, and socialist modernization construction are all out of the question; the broad masses of young students' good wishes to promote socialist democracy and the legal system and to punish corrupt elements such as embezzlement, bribery, and 'official profiteering' will also be in vain. The current situation has already developed beyond the will of the broad masses of young students. We sincerely hope that the broad masses of young students will cherish the stable and united situation, consider the overall situation, and prioritize the interests of the Party, the future of the country, and the destiny of the nation. They should immediately return to school, resume classes, and restore normal teaching order. Any opinions and demands can be fully reflected and resolved through normal democratic and legal channels."

The statement from the Supreme People's Procuratorate is as follows:

"The procuratorial organs across the country have seriously studied and implemented the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, supporting the decisions and measures taken by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to restore normal order in the capital. They will fulfill their duties to maintain social order, promote clean governance, and safeguard the smooth progress of reforms and construction.

"On May 20, the Supreme People's Procuratorate held a staff meeting to arrange for all personnel to seriously study the speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, government, and military cadres' meeting. Comrades believed that the current situation is serious, with a small number of people trampling on socialist legal system, denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and seriously disrupting the normal order of production, work, study, and life. This is a serious political struggle concerning the future and destiny of the country and the nation. The decisive and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council are absolutely necessary and unavoidable. Otherwise, it would be impossible to quickly stop the turmoil, and the consequences would be unthinkable. During the study and discussion, comrades emphasized that the State Council's order, signed by Premier Li Peng, to impose martial law in parts of Beijing is in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of our country. Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution stipulates: 'The State Council has the power to "decide on martial law in parts of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government."' Imposing martial law in parts of Beijing is a precautionary measure taken to resolutely stop the turmoil, which is of great significance for restoring order in the capital, protecting key facilities and public property from damage, and safeguarding the lives and property of the people.

"At the same time, the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued instructions to procuratorial organs across the country, requiring all procuratorial personnel to unswervingly implement the decisions of the Party Central Committee, clearly recognize the current serious situation and the nature of this struggle, stand firm, adhere to the four cardinal principles, be loyal to the Party and the people, and uphold the dignity of the Constitution and the law. The instructions also require procuratorial organs at all levels to fulfill their duties, use legal weapons, persist in the fight against corruption and bribery, focus on investigating and prosecuting major cases, fully support and participate in stopping the turmoil, strengthen social order, and resolutely crack down on various criminal activities in accordance with the law, making active contributions to promoting clean governance and quickly ending the turmoil.

"Procuratorial organs at all levels have taken swift action in accordance with the instructions from the Supreme People's Procuratorate, focusing on work. Many procuratorial offices have taken the initiative to intervene in the investigation of looting, arson, and other criminal cases by public security organs, approving the arrest and prosecution of a number of serious criminal suspects in accordance with the law. The fight against corruption and bribery is deepening, and a number of major corruption and bribery cases have been solved and prosecuted. Public security organs have also promptly intervened in and handled, in accordance with the law, the speculation cases of enterprises, institutions, government agencies, and mass organizations."

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 28th.

The Secretariat of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions announced: Since May 20, the Secretariat has seriously studied and discussed the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the central and Beijing Party, government, and military cadres' meeting, expressing their firm support for the major decisions and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation. The Secretariat believes that the central authorities' major decisions reflect the fundamental interests of the Chinese working class. If the conspiracy of a small number of people to create turmoil succeeds, the entire socialist cause and the tremendous achievements of ten years of reform and opening up will be ruined. In this serious political struggle, trade unions and workers at all levels must clearly stand for the four cardinal principles and oppose the turmoil.

The Secretariat requires that trade union cadres at all levels, together with the workers, seriously study the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, understand the situation, strengthen their confidence, and, together with the broad masses of patriotic students, resolutely oppose the activities of a small number of people who deliberately create incidents, incite strikes, and create turmoil.

In the past month, the broad masses of workers in the capital and across the country have, under extremely complex and difficult conditions, remained at their posts, maintained production and work, and made significant contributions to stabilizing the overall situation and the economy. This once again shows that the Chinese working class is not only the main force in developing productive forces but also the main force in maintaining stability and unity. We believe that the broad masses of workers will continue to carry forward the glorious traditions of the Chinese working class, shoulder their honorable social responsibilities, increase social effective supply, ensure the normal supply of people's livelihood, maintain a stable and united political situation, and make greater contributions to the reform and opening up and modernization construction.

Trade union organizations and the broad masses of trade union cadres have done a lot of work to maintain stability and unity, fulfilling their social functions. The broad masses of workers hope to promote democracy and combat corruption, which is in line with the requirements of the Party and the government.

Trade union cadres at all levels should go to the front line, listen to the opinions of the masses, care about the difficulties of the workers, actively promote multi-level and multi-channel dialogues between workers and the government, between workers and enterprise and institutional administrators, better speak for and serve the workers, protect the legitimate rights and interests of the workers, and solve problems in a democratic and legal manner.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 28th.

On May 26, China National Petroleum Corporation, China National Coal Industry Corporation, China National Nuclear Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation, China National Nonferrous Metals Corporation, and China State Shipbuilding Corporation wrote to the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressing their firm support for the series of major decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil. The full text of the letter is as follows:

We represent all Communist Party members, cadres at all levels, and the broad masses of workers in the coal, petroleum, petrochemical, nuclear, nonferrous metals, and shipbuilding industries across the country. We firmly support the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, firmly support the series of major decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to quickly stop the turmoil, restore normal order in the capital, and stabilize the situation, and firmly support the State Council's order to impose martial law in parts of Beijing and the People's Liberation Army's decisive measures to enter Beijing.

Currently, stopping the turmoil is a serious political struggle concerning the future and destiny of the Party and the country. At this critical moment, the broad masses of workers in our six industrial sectors fully understand their historical mission, consciously fulfill their heavy responsibilities, and, in accordance with the requirements of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, always remain at their posts, maintain production, maintain normal order, and strive to maintain the hard-won stability and unity. We actively increase production for the country, ensuring the needs of economic construction and people's livelihood. The broad masses of workers have shown with their actions that they are a force that the Party and the country can rely on and depend on.

Coal, petroleum, petrochemical, nonferrous metals, shipbuilding, and nuclear industries are important basic industries of the country. The broad masses of workers are an important component of the Chinese working class. In the face of this major struggle between right and wrong, we will resolutely carry out the various orders of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, maintain high consistency in politics and actions with the Party Central Committee and the State Council, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and adhere to stability and unity. In any difficult and complex situation, we will clearly oppose the turmoil, stop the turmoil, remain at our posts, maintain safe production, and strive to improve production and construction. We will make further contributions to maintaining the leadership of the Party, defending the socialist system, and promoting socialist modernization construction.

　　高法高检负责人全总书记处分别表示
    坚决拥护党中央国务院决策
    工业战线六个总公司致函中央
    新华社北京５月２８日电  最高人民法院负责人和最高人民检察院负责人分别发表谈话，表示坚决拥护中央决策，发挥职能作用，维护社会安定。
    最高人民法院负责人的谈话如下：
    “近一时期，人民解放军、公安干警、武警和社会各界为制止动乱、维护安定，进行了不懈的努力。我们谨向担负北京市部分地区戒严任务部队的全体官兵、公安干警、武警表示敬意和慰问。向日夜坚守工作岗位，为维护首都秩序、保证社会生活正常运转付出了艰苦劳动的机关、工厂、商店和企事业单位的干部职工表示感谢。
    “北京的事态表明，极少数人利用青年学生的爱国热情制造动乱，如不迅速扭转局面，稳定局势，就会导致全国范围的大动乱。为了制止动乱，恢复首都秩序，保卫要害部门和公共财产不受侵犯，保卫人民的生命和财产安全，李鹏同志宣布了中共中央政治局常委会的重大决策，杨尚昆同志作了重要讲话，我们完全拥护。国务院关于在北京市部分地区实行戒严的决定，是根据我国宪法第８９条第１６项的规定作出的，是合法的、正确的。人民解放军奉命来京执行戒严任务，是符合广大人民群众利益的，是完全必要的。我们人民法院要认真履行宪法和法律赋予的职责，充分发挥审判职能作用。对乘机破坏社会治安，扰乱社会秩序，情节严重的首要分子；对一切进行打、砸、抢、烧的犯罪分子，要坚决依法严惩，努力为维护秩序、稳定局势做出应有的贡献。
    “我们看到，广大青年学生出自爱国热情，要求惩治贪污、受贿、“官倒”等腐败行为，这同党和政府要努力实现的目标是一致的。这也是人民法院的一项重要任务。几年来我们在党中央的领导和全国人大及其常委会的监督下，一直坚持依法严厉打击各种严重危害社会治安的犯罪活动和各种严重经济犯罪活动。１９８８年，全国法院审结经济犯罪案件５５７１０件，判处被告人７４９２３名。其中，判处贪污案件被告人８４２８名，判处受贿案件被告人１５８４名。判处投机倒把案件被告人１６９９名，判处走私案件被告人１９８名。今年第一季度，人民法院又受理了１５７８７件经济犯罪案件。今年２月２０日，最高人民法院发出通知，要求全国各级人民法院在坚持依法从严惩处严重经济犯罪活动时，要特别注意依法严惩贪污、受贿、投机倒把和走私等严重经济犯罪分子。３月１５日，最高人民法院与最高人民检察院联合发出了《关于当前处理企业事业单位、机关、团体投机倒把犯罪案件的规定》，对社会上关心的依法惩治“官倒”的适用法律问题作出了重要的司法解释，并通过新闻界向全国通报了司法解释的有关情况。５月初，我们召开了全国高级法院院长座谈会，对严厉打击严重危害社会治安的犯罪活动和严重经济犯罪活动，进一步作了具体部署。同时，我们还召开了全国法院廉政建设工作会议，向全国法院工作人员提出了拒绝腐蚀、清正廉洁、秉公执法的明确要求。这两个会议的精神，目前各级法院正在认真贯彻执行。
    “为了保证治理整顿、深化改革的顺利进行，我们欢迎广大人民群众，广大爱国师生，对于经济领域的犯罪活动，尤其是贪污、受贿、投机倒把、走私等严重犯罪，进行揭发检举。人民法院将依照法律程序认真进行处理，对于检举人，一定依法保护，使之不受侵害。对于起诉到法院的案件，我们都将坚持公民在法律面前一律平等的宪法原则，严格依法办事。对于这类案件，我们坚持公开审判，并公开宣判，使法院的审判活动，置于广大人民群众的监督之下。我们真诚地希望广大人民群众，广大爱国师生给予支持，同贪污、受贿、投机倒把、走私等严重犯罪分子，作坚决斗争。
    “大家知道，我们搞四化，搞改革开放，关键是稳定。没有稳定的局面，那什么事也就干不成了。什么改革开放，什么民主法制，什么社会主义现代化建设，都无从谈起；广大青年学生促进社会主义民主和法制、惩治贪污、受贿、“官倒”等腐败分子的良好愿望，也将落空。现在事态的发展已经完全不以广大青年学生的意志为转移了。我们真诚希望广大青年学生，要珍惜安定团结的局面，从大局考虑，以党的利益、国家的前途和民族的命运为重，立即返校复课，恢复正常的教学秩序，有什么意见和要求，完全可以通过正常的民主与法制的渠道反映，求得解决。”
    最高人民检察院负责人的谈话如下：
    “全国检察机关认真学习贯彻李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委为恢复首都正常秩序而采取的各项措施，发挥职能作用，维护社会治安，促进廉政建设，保卫改革和建设的顺利进行。
    “５月２０日，最高人民检察院召开干部会议，布置全体工作人员认真学习了李鹏、杨尚昆同志在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话。同志们认为，当前的形势是严峻的，极少数人践踏社会主义法制，否定中国共产党的领导和社会主义制度，严重地破坏了正常的生产、工作、学习和生活秩序。这是一场关系到国家和民族前途命运的严肃的政治斗争。党中央、国务院决定采取的坚决果断措施是十分必要的，也是不得已的，不如此就不可能迅速制止动乱，后果不堪设想。在学习讨论中，同志们强调指出，李鹏总理签署的在北京部分地区实行戒严的国务院令，是符合我国宪法规定的。宪法第８９条第１６项规定：国务院有权“决定省、自治区、直辖市的范围内部分地区的戒严”。在北京部分地区实行戒严，是为了坚决制止动乱而采取的一种警戒措施，这对于恢复首都秩序，保卫要害部门和公共财产不受侵犯，保卫人民的生命和财产安全，具有十分重要的意义。
    “同时，最高人民检察院向全国检察机关发出指示，要求全体检察人员坚定不移地贯彻执行党中央的决策，清醒认识当前的严峻形势和这场斗争的性质，站稳立场，坚持四项基本原则，忠于党和人民，维护宪法和法律的尊严。指示还要求各级检察机关发挥职能作用，运用法律武器，坚持开展反贪污、受贿斗争，抓紧查处大案要案；全力支持和参加制止动乱，强化社会治安，坚决依法打击各种刑事犯罪活动，为促进廉政建设和迅速结束动乱作出积极贡献。
    “各级检察机关根据高检院的指示，迅速行动，抓紧工作。许多检察院都提前介入公安机关对打、砸、抢、烧犯罪案件的侦察工作，依法批准逮捕、起诉了一批严重刑事犯罪分子。反贪污、受贿斗争正在深入发展，侦破、起诉了一批重大贪污、受贿犯罪案件，对公安机关侦破的企业事业单位、机关、团体投机倒把犯罪案件也及时介入，抓紧审查依法处理。”
    新华社北京５月２８日电　中华全国总工会书记处消息：５月２０日以来，全总书记处认真学习讨论了李鹏同志、杨尚昆同志在中央和北京市党政军干部大会上的重要讲话，一致表示坚决拥护党中央、国务院为制止动乱、稳定局势所作出的重大决策和采取的果断措施。全总书记处认为中央的重大决策体现了我国工人阶级的根本利益。如果极少数人制造动乱的阴谋得逞，整个社会主义事业，十年改革开放的巨大成果，都将毁于一旦。在当前这场严重的政治斗争中，全国职工和各级工会必须旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，反对动乱。
    全总书记处要求，各级工会干部要同职工群众一道，认真学习李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，认清形势，坚定信心，和广大爱国学生一起，坚决反对极少数人蓄意制造事端、煽动罢工、制造动乱的活动。
    一个多月来，首都和全国的广大职工，在极为复杂和困难的形势下，坚守岗位，坚持生产和工作，为稳定大局，稳定经济，做出了重大贡献。事实再一次表明，我国工人阶级不仅是发展生产力的主力军，也是维护安定团结的主力军。我们相信，广大职工一定会继续发扬我国工人阶级的光荣传统，肩负起自己光荣的社会责任，为增加社会有效供给，保障人民生活的正常供应，维护安定团结的政治局面，坚持改革开放和现代化建设，做出更大的贡献。
    各级工会组织和广大工会干部为维护安定团结做了大量的工作，履行了自己的社会职能。广大职工希望促进民主、整治腐败的愿望，与党和政府的要求是一致的。
    各级工会干部要深入第一线，倾听群众意见，关心职工疾苦，积极推进职工与政府之间、职工与企事业单位行政之间多层次、多渠道的对话，更好地为职工说话办事，维护职工群众的合法权益，使问题能够在民主和法制的轨道上得到合理的解决。
    新华社北京５月２８日电　中国石油天然气总公司、中国统配煤矿总公司、中国核工业总公司、中国石油化工总公司、中国有色金属总公司、中国船舶工业总公司，５月２６日致函党中央、国务院，表示坚决拥护党中央、国务院为制止动乱所作出的一系列重大决策。信函内容全文如下：
    我们代表全国煤炭、石油、石化、核工业、有色金属、船舶工业战线全体共产党员、各级干部和广大工人，坚决拥护李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，坚决拥护党中央、国务院为迅速制止动乱、恢复首都正常秩序、稳定局势所作出的一系列重大决策，坚决拥护国务院关于北京部分地区实行戒严的命令和人民解放军进驻北京的果断措施。
    当前制止动乱是一场关系到党和国家前途和命运的严重政治斗争。在这样严峻的时刻，我们六个工业部门的广大职工，充分认识自己的历史使命，自觉履行自己肩负的重任，按照党中央、国务院的要求，始终坚守岗位，坚持生产，坚持正常秩序，努力维护来之不易的安定团结，积极为国家增加生产，保证经济建设和人民生活的需要。广大职工以实际行动，表明自己是党和国家可以信赖和依靠的力量。
    煤炭、石油、石化、有色、船舶、核工业是国家重要的基础工业，广大职工队伍是我国工人阶级重要的组成部分。在这场大是大非的斗争面前，我们坚决执行党中央、国务院的各项号令，坚决在政治上、行动上与党中央、国务院保持高度一致，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，坚持安定团结。在任何困难和复杂的情况下，都要旗帜鲜明地反对动乱、制止动乱，坚守工作岗位，坚持安全生产，努力把生产建设搞上去。为维护党的领导，保卫社会主义制度，推进社会主义现代化建设，进一步作出自己的贡献。
