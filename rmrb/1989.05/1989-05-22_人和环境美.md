The saying "Near vermilion, one becomes red; near ink, one becomes black" is only half true, because there is also the other half where one does not become red near vermilion or black near ink. There is a famous saying: "Emerging from the mud but unstained." If one emerges from the mud and is completely stained, wouldn't that be as unbelievable as saying "There are no good people in Hongdong County"?

The relationship between people and their environment is reciprocal and dialectical. People are products of their environment, but they can also influence and transform their environment. Environments can generally be divided into two types: physical environments (or natural environments) and psychological environments (or behavioral environments). Physical environments can exist independently of people, but psychological environments cannot. Nowadays, due to the humanization of nature, purely physical environments are becoming fewer and fewer. Therefore, in a certain sense, the environment is the same as people; people and their environment are one.

However, we often see the environment but not the people, that is, we emphasize the beauty of the natural environment while neglecting the beauty of people themselves. For example, planting grass and trees, cultivating flowers and moving plants, these are all good things, but those who draw materials from natural resources are few, while those who waste human and material resources are many. Large-scale construction projects, such as building pavilions and water pavilions, fall into this category.

Psychological environments have many levels. Social environments, political environments, and economic environments can be called large environments; cultural environments, neighborhood environments, and interpersonal environments can be called small environments. The concepts of large and small environments are relative. Although the problems they deal with are not the same, they have a commonality: they all center around people and revolve around people's mutual relationships.

Social stability, political clarity, and economic prosperity are signs of a beautiful large environment. They are achieved through the beauty of people, that is, the harmony of mutual relationships. The "Guoyu" records that when King Ling of Chu built the Zhanghua Terrace, he asked Wu Ju whether it was beautiful. Wu Ju replied: "I have heard that a ruler's beauty lies in his attire, his joy lies in the peace of his people, his wisdom lies in his virtue, and his enlightenment lies in his far-sightedness. I have not heard that he considers the height of the earth and wood or the intricate carvings as beautiful..." The issue at hand concerns the beauty of the environment, but Wu Ju brings it back to interpersonal relationships, which seems to deviate from the topic. In reality, it shows Wu Ju's wisdom. Look at how he defines beauty: "Beauty is when there is no harm between superiors and inferiors, insiders and outsiders, small and large, near and far, hence it is called beauty." No harm means harmony, and harmony means beauty. If an environment destroys the harmony of people's mutual relationships, it cannot be considered truly beautiful. This principle seems to have been universally acknowledged in ancient times, even Confucius said: "The use of rituals is to value harmony. The way of the ancient kings is beautiful in this regard."

The same applies to small environments. A harmonious neighborhood environment can make people live and work in peace; a harmonious interpersonal environment can make people feel at ease; a refined cultural environment can nurture all kinds of talents. According to historical records, in the early fourth century, the ancient Roman Empire had, in its capital alone, various public sculptures standing tall, including 22 large equestrian statues, 80 gilded statues, 73 golden ivory deities, 3,785 bronze statues, two giant elephants over 30 meters high, and a total of 3,962 statues throughout the city. It was truly a forest of statues. Together with the public theaters, temples, murals, squares, fountains, triumphal arches, amphitheaters, and public baths scattered throughout the city, these memorial and public buildings formed a "rich and cultured" cultural atmosphere or environment. Such an environment can nurture outstanding talents. It is no coincidence that ancient Rome, following ancient Greece, saw the rise of a magnificent second cultural peak in human history, which is closely related to such a cultural environment.

Such an environment, of course, does not fall from the sky; it is created by beautiful people. "Outstanding individuals" and "spiritually rich lands" have always been in a dialectical relationship. In the 18th century, a British writer praised the natural scenery and municipal facilities of the Netherlands, but he deeply disliked the bourgeois upstarts, finding them utterly unappealing. He said: "The Dutch people I saw in their homes in the Netherlands gave me the impression of a magnificent Egyptian temple housing a bull."

There is a Western proverb: "To know who I am, tell me who your friends are." This saying is about the relationship between people and the beauty of their environment.

### 人和环境美

　　人和环境美
    思效
    “近朱者赤，近墨者黑”，这句话只对了一半，因为还有近朱者不赤、近墨者不黑的一半。有句名言是大家熟知的：“出污泥而不染”；如果出污泥而尽染，岂不同“洪洞县里无好人”一样，令人难以置信吗？
    人和环境的关系是反向的，辩证的，人是环境的产物，同时人可以影响和改造环境。环境大体上可分为两种：物理环境（或自然环境）和心理学环境（或行为环境）。物理环境可以离开人而存在，心理学环境则离不开人。现在由于“人化自然”的结果，纯粹的物理环境也越来越少了。所以在某种意义上，环境就是人，人和环境是同一的。
    然而，我们往往见物而不见人，即重视自然环境的美，而忽视人自身的美。比如，种草种树，莳花移木，这本是好事，但取材于自然资源者少，滥用人力物力者多；大兴土木，建造亭台水榭等即属此类。
    心理学环境有许多层次。社会环境，政治环境，经济环境等，可以称之为大环境；文化环境，邻里环境，人际环境等，可以称之为小环境。大小环境的概念是相对的，它们处理的问题虽不相同，却有共同之处，即都以人为中心，以人的相互关系为转移。
    社会安定，政治清明，经济繁荣，是大环境美的标志，它是通由人的美即相互关系的和谐而达到的。《国语》记载，楚灵王建章华之台，问伍举美不美？回答说：“臣闻国君服宠以为美，安民以为乐，听德以为聪，致远以为明，不闻其以土木之崇高、形镂为美，……”问题涉及的是环境美的问题，伍举却拉扯到人际关系上去，似乎是有背于论题，实际上表明了伍举的高明处。且看他给美下的定义：“夫美也者，上下、内外、小大、远近皆无害焉，故曰美。”无害就是和谐，和谐就是美。一个环境，如果破坏了人们相互关系的和谐，就不能算作真正的美。这个道理在古代似乎得到普遍承认，连孔子也说：“礼之用，和为贵，先王之道，斯为美。”
    大环境如此，小环境亦然。一个和睦的近邻里环境可以使人安居乐业；一个融洽的人际环境可以使人心情舒畅；一个高雅的文化环境可以造就各种人才。据史记载，四世纪初的古罗马帝国，光首都一地，耸立的各种公共雕塑，计有大的骑马雕像二十二个，镀金像八十个，黄金象牙神像七十三个，铜像三千七百八十五个，高三十多米的巨象两个，全城共三千九百六十二个。真可谓雕像林立。这些雕像同遍布全城的剧场、庙堂、壁画、广场、喷泉、凯旋门、斗兽场、公共浴池等纪念性建筑和公共建筑一起，构成了一个“郁郁乎文哉”的文化氛围或环境。这样的环境是能够钟灵毓秀的，它孕育出不少各种杰出的人才。古罗马之所以能继古希腊之后，出现人类史上蔚为壮观的第二个文化高峰，是同这样的文化环境分不开的。
    这样的环境当然不是从天上掉下来的，而是由美的人创造出来的。“人杰”与“地灵”从来就是辩证的关系。十八世纪有一位英国作家，对荷兰的自然风光和市政设施之美赞不绝口，唯独对资产阶级暴发户深感倒胃，认为他们大煞风景，他说：“我在荷兰人家中见到的荷兰人，没有一个不给我这样的印象：一座富丽堂皇的埃及庙宇，里面供奉着的却是一头公牛。”
    西方有句谚语：你想知道我是谁，请告诉我你的朋友是谁。这句话说的是人和环境美的关系。
