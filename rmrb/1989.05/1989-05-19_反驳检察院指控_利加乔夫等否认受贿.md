Refuting the Prosecutor's Accusations

Ligachov and Solomentsev Deny Accepting Bribes

MOSCOW, May 18 (Xinhua) — CPSU Central Committee Politburo member Yegor Ligachov and former Politburo member Vladimir Solomentsev issued statements on May 15 and 17, respectively, denying allegations of accepting bribes and demanding that the investigation results be made public.

Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said today at a press conference that Soviet prosecutors Ivanov and Godlyan recently accused Ligachov and Solomentsev of accepting bribes during speeches at a Leningrad TV station and a Moscow public gathering.

Ligachov and Solomentsev both issued statements to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the Soviet courts. Ligachov's statement said that Ivanov's accusations against him were provocative and defamatory. He demanded an investigation into the matter and that the results be made public.

Solomentsev's statement called Godlyan's accusations against him "a rude provocation and a vile, complete lie." He requested legal action against Godlyan and Ivanov and that the investigation results be published in the media.
