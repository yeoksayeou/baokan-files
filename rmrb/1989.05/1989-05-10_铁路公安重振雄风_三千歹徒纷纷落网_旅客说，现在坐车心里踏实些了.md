Railway public security forces have recently intensified their efforts to combat criminal activities that endanger the railways, and initial results are already visible. In just 15 days, over 3,000 criminals have been apprehended.

According to incomplete statistics, from April 12 to April 27, a total of 3,147 lawbreakers were captured, 171 criminal gangs were dismantled, and 640,000 yuan in stolen money was recovered.

Each railway public security bureau has identified key areas and concentrated their efforts to combat different security situations. The Harbin Bureau has focused on eight key routes and 19 pairs of passenger trains, implementing a "three-strict" campaign (strict crackdown, strict prevention, strict management).

Currently, the 62 patrol police teams across the entire railway network are using fixed-point, fixed-post, and fixed-responsibility methods, combined with station and train patrols, to focus on 145 key sections and 248 pairs of passenger trains. A crew member on the 172nd passenger train said, "In the past, when we encountered robbers attacking passengers, we wanted to intervene but dared not. Now that the patrol police are on board, we feel more confident." Passengers on the train said, "Now we feel more at ease when traveling by train."

　　铁路公安重振雄风  三千歹徒纷纷落网
    旅客说，现在坐车心里踏实些了
    据新华社北京５月１０日电（记者李玫、实习生姜歆远）铁路公安系统近期集中打击危害铁路的刑事犯罪活动初见成效。短短的１５天，３０００多名犯罪分子纷纷落入法网。
    据不完全统计，４月１２日至４月２７日，共捕获不法分子３１４７名，摧毁犯罪团伙１７１个，追回赃款６４万元。
    各铁路公安局针对不同的治安形势，确立重点，集中打击。哈尔滨局对八条重点线路和３０１／３０２、５２１／５２２等十九对旅客列车进行“三严”整治（严打、严防、严管）。
    如今，全路６２个巡警队采取定车、定岗、定责、站车结合的方法，对１４５个重点区段和２４８对旅客列车进行重点巡视。１７２次客车一位列车员说：“以前遇到歹徒抢劫旅客，我们想管不敢管。现在巡警队上车，我们的胆子也大了。”列车上的旅客说：“现在坐车心里踏实些了。”
