Yesterday morning, the University of East Asia held a ceremony to confer an honorary doctorate in public administration on Guangdong Province Governor Ye Xianping, in recognition of his "important contributions to promoting cooperation between Guangdong and Macau, particularly in higher education."

Ye Xianping visited Macau in 1984. He expressed that this visit deepened his understanding of Macau. Compared to his previous visit, Macau has made significant progress in various aspects over the past few years. He said that since the signing of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, the relationship between Guangdong and Macau has entered a new phase. The stability and prosperity of Macau are beneficial for Guangdong to fully leverage its advantages, while the success of Guangdong's reform and opening-up will certainly aid Macau's development.

Macau Governor Carlos D'Abreu expressed that Ye Xianping's visit to Macau has further strengthened the friendly relations between Macau and Guangdong, which will be greatly beneficial to the development of Macau's culture, education, commerce, and other sectors.

Ye Xianping left Macau this afternoon, concluding his four-day visit.
