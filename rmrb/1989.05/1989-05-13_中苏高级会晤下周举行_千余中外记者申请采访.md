More than 1,000 domestic and foreign journalists have applied to China for coverage of the upcoming high-level Sino-Soviet meeting, according to information obtained by Xinhua News Agency reporters today.

The top leaders of China and the Soviet Union have not met for 30 years, and relations between the two countries have been in a state of stagnation and abnormality for a long time. Soviet leader Gorbachev will begin a four-day official visit to China next week. During his visit, the Chinese leadership will meet and hold talks with him. Deng Xiaoping's meeting with Gorbachev will mark the normalization of relations between the two countries.

The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is not only a major event in the history of Sino-Soviet relations but will also have a positive impact on the stability and security of the world situation. Gorbachev's visit to China has attracted journalists from many countries to Beijing for coverage.

The journalists applying for coverage include: more than 100 Soviet journalists who have come to Beijing specifically for this purpose, more than 800 journalists from other countries who have temporarily come to Beijing, nearly 80 journalists from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, 160 foreign journalists stationed in Beijing, and more than 100 Chinese journalists.

    新华社北京５月１３日电（记者辛怀时）本社记者今天获悉，１０００多名中外记者已向中国方面提出申请，要求采访中苏高级会晤。
    中苏两国最高领导人已经有３０年没有会晤了，两国关系长期处于僵冷和不正常状况。苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫下星期一开始对中国进行为期４天的正式访问。在他访华期间，中国领导人将同他会晤和会谈。邓小平同戈尔巴乔夫的会晤，将标志中苏两国关系恢复正常。
    中苏恢复正常关系不仅是中苏关系史上的大事，而且也会对世界局势的稳定与安全产生积极的影响。戈尔巴乔夫的中国之行，吸引了众多国家的记者来北京采访。
    要求采访的记者包括：专程来京的苏联记者１００多名，临时来京的其他国家记者８００多名，港澳台记者近８０名，常驻北京的外国记者１６０名，以及中国记者１００多名。
