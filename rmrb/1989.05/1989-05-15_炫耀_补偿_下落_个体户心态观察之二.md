Showing Off, Compensation, and Downfall – Observations on the Mindset of Individual Household Operators (Part II)
Zhang Jinli Li Qi

In 1986, Pavarotti caused a sensation in the Chinese music scene. Black market ticket prices soared to tens of yuan per ticket. However, the singer could not have imagined that his powerful singing became a lullaby for a few "rich" individuals in the front row.

After the performance, I asked an individual household operator who had fallen asleep in the theater why he spent so much money to buy a ticket just to sleep. He confidently replied, "Whether you listen or not is not important; what's important is that you buy it."

Showing off wealth has become a common phenomenon among some individual household operators.

They have established such goals: T-shirts should be from West Germany's "Puma," shirts from France's "Richman." Sportswear should be "Adidas," and as for suits, they should be from the famous fashion designer "Pierre Cardin." They admit that spending a lot of money is not just for the enjoyment of the consumption process but mainly to gain the admiration of others.

Respect was once a foreign concept to them. When large amounts of money have satisfied their material desires, they are even more eager to gain something in the spiritual realm. Showing off has become fashionable.

In a certain city's dance hall, the following scene occurred: After a singer finished a song, an individual household operator immediately threw a few tens of yuan at the singer, shouting, "Sing another 'Follow Your Feelings'!"

After another song, another individual household operator threw even more money.

In the previous article, Little A excitedly told us, "You know, we individual household operators want to buy respect with money."

He shared his "heart-wrenching" experience:

"I fought with my neighbor's family for Little Mei and accidentally injured someone, which led to my imprisonment. After I was released, Little Mei dumped me. I was almost driven crazy by anger. At that time, no one in the neighborhood looked at me with respect. My current girlfriend is a model from a clothing company; she is incredibly beautiful."

"I know that many people curse me behind my back. However, the feeling of being looked down upon and the feeling of being envied are different."

Individual household operators like Little A have a strong "compensation" mentality. Each of them has gone through a painful experience. In the past two years, they have suddenly become wealthy, and they want to make up for the material and spiritual "losses" of the past few years in just one night.

Hanzheng Street in Wuhan is a kingdom of the rich, but in this kingdom, last year, eleven "subjects" went to Guangzhou to gamble, throwing away thousands of yuan in the smoke-filled gambling dens. The biggest loser lost 70,000 yuan, and the smallest loser lost over 30,000 yuan...

A writer once said, "Money can create new wealth and happiness for humanity, but money can also breed evil and decadence."

　　炫耀·补偿·下落    
    ——个体户心态观察之二
    张锦力　李琦
    一九八六年，帕瓦罗蒂在中国歌坛引起轰动。黑市票价上升到几十元钱一张。可歌唱家不会想到，他的引亢高歌却成了前排座位几位“富翁”的催眠曲。
    散场后，我问一位在剧场里打盹的个体户，为何花高价买觉睡。他振振有词：“听不听并不重要，重要的是买。”
    炫耀富有，已成为一部分个体户的流行病。
    他们确立了这样的追求：Ｔ恤衫要西德“彪马”，衬衣要法国的“富豪”。运动衣要“阿迪达斯”，至于西装嘛，就要那个以世界著名服装设计师命名的“皮尔卡丹”。他们承认，花高价不仅是为了消费过程的享受，更主要是想赢得别人的羡慕。
    尊重，对他们曾是陌生的字眼。当大把大把的钞票已满足了他们的物质享受时，他们更加迫切地想在精神上得到些什么，讲“派头”成为时髦。
    某市一个舞厅里发生过这样一幕：歌星一曲唱罢，一个体户观众立即把几拾元票子甩给歌星，叫道：“再来一个《跟着感觉走》！”
    又一首后，另一个则甩出更多的票子。
    前篇提到的小Ａ曾激动地对我们说：“你知道，我们个体户是想用金钱买到尊重。”
    他介绍了自己“痛彻心扉”的感受：
    “我是为了小梅才与她家邻居打架，失手伤人而去坐牢的。出狱后，小梅把我蹬了。差点没把我气疯，那阵子，左邻右舍谁拿正眼瞧过咱，我现在的女友是服装公司的模特，甭提多漂亮了。”
    “我知道，很多人背后常骂我。可是尝受别人瞧不起的白眼，和让别人嫉妒得眼红，那滋味毕竟不一样。”
    像小Ａ这样的个体户，有着一肿“补偿”心理，他们每个人都曾有过一段痛苦的经历。这两年忽然暴富，他们恨不得在一个晚上，就补回过去若干年的物质上和精神上的“损失”。
    武汉的汉正街是个富翁王国，然而就在这个王国里，去年，十一位臣民结伴下羊城赌博，在烟雾笼罩的赌场一掷千金，多者输掉七万元，少者也在三万元以上……  一位作家曾说：“金钱能为人类创造新的财富和幸福，金钱也能滋生罪恶和堕落。”
