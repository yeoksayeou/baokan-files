The commander-in-chief was awarding medals to the heroes, and when he came to the name Zhang Xuexin, he stumbled. After struggling for a while, he suddenly roared out, "Captain Zhang Xue—pile!" He didn't recognize the character "鑫." Since it was a pile of gold, he naturally assumed it should be read as "pile."

What initially attracted me was not Zhang Xuexin, but one of the ordinary mid-level officials among the hundreds of cadres under Zhang Xuexin—Public Relations Department Manager Liu Xinsheng. Hold on, don't think of "public relations" and immediately picture a beautiful woman. I have indeed seen some capable public relations ladies. Because of this, this "public relations man" in front of me surprised me. He is not handsome, just ordinary-looking; he is not tall and strong, but he is sturdy. He is serious and proper, like a man's hardcover book, honest and reliable, almost stiff and hard. His public relations language always reminds me of the commands given during military drills. From his attire to his bones, he has a military air. His ability to attract my interest shows that his public relations skills are successful. A year and a half ago, he was still a top-level pilot and squadron commander in the air force, flying for eighteen years without ever having an accident, not even a near-miss. I asked, "Do you like your job in the Public Relations Department?"

"Yes, I do."

"Do your eighteen years of flying experience come in handy? Or is there some connection between flying and public relations?"

"On the contrary, the life of a pilot is completely closed off. Once on the ground, everything is prepared for taking off, and once in the air, you forget about the ground and the world. On the ground, you wear a flight suit, and in the air, you sit in a sealed cockpit. Flying requires our lives to be monotonous. Twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year, we must concentrate on flying. We don't know what nightclubs, bars, or the world of flowers are. The Public Relations Department is open, and I need to live an open life."

"Is Zhang, the general manager, satisfied with your work?"

"He hasn't expressed dissatisfaction."

I thought Zhang Xuexin must be satisfied. Such a Public Relations Department manager gives people a sense of safety, reliability, and trustworthiness. Zhang Xuexin really knows how to use people, truly "out of the ordinary to achieve victory." Is Liu Xinsheng one of the "pile of gold" that Zhang Xuexin has?

From this, many stories about Zhang Xuexin's use of people emerged. He is a man of character and does not consider obedience to himself as the main condition for selecting cadres.

In the past, he had been the director of a radio station and was often called by the brigade commander to play poker. He would lose and obediently crawl under the table, but the brigade commander would lose and refuse to lower his dignity to crawl under the table. He, relying on his strength, would force the brigade commander's head under the table, which angered the brigade commander, but he didn't care.

In early 1985, the newly established China Automobile Industry South Trade Company faced unfortunate timing. The state tightened its monetary policy, and the "Hainan Automobile Incident," which shocked the country and the world, led to a Chinese-style "one-cut" document: not a single car could be sold in Guangdong!

Zhang Xuexin, who had become an automobile tycoon, still had thousands of cars in his warehouse. The large parking lot in the warehouse was filled with neat rows of steel formations, gleaming in various colors under the sun, making one dizzy just to look at them! 700 million yuan of funds were frozen, and the entire company was like a dead chessboard. Everyone was anxious. Zhang Xuexin went everywhere like a cloud carrying thunder and lightning—he was brewing his own thunder and lightning. The "South Trade" company seemed large, but it was actually very fragile, only able to sway with the political and economic climate of the state. It would shake with the wind and freeze with the cold. In the future, it should be strong enough to create its own climate, even influencing the political and economic climate of the state. He wanted to shake up all his cadres and send them out. The order was issued: "This battle must be won, or we will lose the entire war. In business competition, there is no understanding or sympathy. The commercial economy is not a gentle, nurturing greenhouse waiting for you to slowly mature. It is a ruthless world of survival of the fittest. We must seek challenges, accept challenges, and turn disasters and misfortunes into opportunities for development..."

Zhang Xuexin led the enterprise and commanded the cadres with the bold and unrestrained methods and style of a man. His automobile trading company was the first in the country, and even high-ranking government officials looked at it with a new and curious eye. This company was created by Zhang Xuexin, and his character was deeply imprinted in the company's image. The personality of the number one leader is often the personality of the enterprise. Not acknowledging or erasing this personality will harm the enterprise. In such a new business, creation is far more important than experience, and experience plays at most a secondary role.

Therefore, in Zhang Xuexin's company, just being obedient is not enough; it might even be dangerous. In his company, sticking to old rules has no future; one must dare to venture and find their own position. The female secretary in the general manager's office, Chen Qianxiu, was the first to sit still. She volunteered to go north to see the officials. This 1958 vocational school graduate with a major in railway engineering was simple and straightforward, with an inner strength, a sense of urgency, and a controlled righteous indignation. She was determined to first find the head of the State Bureau of Materials, and if that didn't work, she would go to the State Council and the Party Central Committee. She only wanted to clarify a simple fact: the cars in the South Trade Company were different from the cars in the incident; they were bought through proper channels, and the losses from being frozen in the warehouse would also be the state's. She stood behind the director of the Mechanical and Electrical Bureau under the State Bureau of Materials and spoke for over two hours. The director, who felt very troubled, did not even turn around to look at her seriously. The director went home, and she followed him there. She believed that as long as human emotions could flow, materials would also flow.

Things are in the hands of people. Chen Qianxiu made five trips to Beijing in a month, spent half a year outside in a year, and used all her salary and bonuses for travel expenses. Her sincerity finally moved the iron-clad Chinese system. With the help of the director of the Mechanical and Electrical Bureau of the State Bureau of Materials, the state recognized the legality of the South Trade Company's sale of automobiles. Chen Qianxiu did not rest on her laurels and sold 2,400 domestically produced cars that year, and 3,000 the next year. The "South Trade" company began to come back to life, and another entrepreneur with a pioneering spirit emerged. Zhang Xuexin appointed Chen Qianxiu as the deputy general manager and sales department manager of the South Trade Company.

The power of openness and freedom created Zhang Xuexin. He also provided his subordinates with sufficient support and freedom to develop, thus attracting a large number of elite talents.

In front of me, the party secretary and deputy general manager, Shi Zhaolong, who worked harmoniously with Zhang Xuexin, called him "boss." Shi Zhaolong had a ruddy complexion, neatly combed hair, and wore a formal gray Zhongshan suit—people in Guangdong call this kind of suit a "shared suit." Nowadays, it is rare to see someone wearing it on the streets, but when worn by Shi Zhaolong, it harmonized perfectly with his demeanor. He was confident, worldly, and had worked as the manager of the Huayue Company in Hong Kong for four years. The cadres were a bit afraid of him. It was said that Guangdong had a new custom: you couldn't visit someone without bringing a gift. Employees who came to him for help were not allowed to bring gifts, and if they did, they had to take them back. If they didn't take them back, he would throw them out the window. I asked him about this in person, and he had his own unique perspective:

"Those who violate discipline are afraid of me, which means I am right. Those who do not violate discipline are afraid of me, which means I am too serious. In today's society, people are frivolous, and it is rare to find someone who is serious. What's wrong with being a bit serious?"

I asked again, "Generally, people think that a balanced team needs one strong and one weak member. You and Zhang are both strong, so why are you so harmonious?"

"The Communist Party is the ruling party, so how can the government be strong and the party be weak? As long as the goals are the same, we can coordinate well. People are not the same as things. Things that clash will be damaged, but people have souls and need to be both strong and flexible. My job is to ensure that the general manager's management runs smoothly. As a secretary, you need to be able to coordinate, use people, organize, praise, and criticize."

There were also titles like "Import King," "Car Master," "Financial Magician," "Car Doctor," and so on. The South Trade Company was indeed a pile of gold. Zhang Xuexin was undoubtedly the top of this pile.

This genuine Shandong man had a large head, a long face, and piercing eyes. He stood out in a crowd, and people had to look up or bend down to see him. Over time, he developed the habit of hunching his shoulders, resembling the figure of Zhong Kui on stage. His movements were casual and natural, perhaps because various difficulties and unexpected troubles constantly challenged him, keeping him young, strong, and flexible—both in spirit and body. His mouth was full of Jiao Dong dialect, soft-spoken, slow, and incongruous with his large physique.

In 1971, he was transferred to the Automobile Parts Company (the predecessor of the South Trade Company). In early 1981, the manager of the Automobile Parts Company was transferred, and Zhang Xuexin was authorized to take charge of the company's overall work. His time had come! But the company was losing 290,000 yuan a year. Due to past grandiosity or chaotic management, several car factories that were neither here nor there were established, producing some unknown brand cars that were of poor quality and high price, much like the products of the Great Leap Forward. They could not compete with the major domestic car factories, let alone withstand the onslaught of foreign cars. They collapsed like a gust of wind, and the burden fell on Zhang Xuexin's shoulders.

His appointment during the company's crisis might also have been a kind of luck! Various pressures burst forth, and he had to take on the responsibility of recreating and opening up new prospects.

"Push open the window and look, the ground is full of Japanese cars"—truly, "where there is a road, there is a Toyota car"! Resistance was useless, and lamenting was of no use. The key was to face reality and seek the initiative in passivity. He sent people to guard the nine major traffic arteries in Guangdong, counting the flow and types of passing cars. The results of three months of road tests showed that imported cars accounted for 40% of Guangdong's car ownership but had a particularly high usage rate, accounting for 70% of the car flow. These cars would break down and have problems. Zhang Xuexin tentatively imported $200,000 worth of foreign car parts. This was not a small deal, especially since the foreign exchange was borrowed at the risk of one's head.

Zhang Xuexin had a nature that pursued risk-taking. The modern business secret is to gain rewards through risk-taking. The car parts he imported were quickly sold out. The second year, the revenue from this item alone reached 190 million yuan. The third year, it reached 300 million yuan.

"Now we have the conditions and qualifications to talk to the Japanese."—Zhang Xuexin went to Japan three times. According to the custom, since China had bought so many Japanese cars, Japan should provide repair equipment to China for free. Toyota did this for developed countries. They ignored China because they thought Chinese people were honest and could not master their repair technology.

In front of foreigners, Zhang Xuexin was bold and unyielding, with his Zhong Kui shoulders raised, and wrinkles of disdain on his forehead and eyes. He himself did not want anything, including refusing the women who tried to sit next to him and touch him. He was not there to indulge in foreign pleasures or beg for alms but to demand what he should get: "Do you know the distribution and movement of Japanese cars in China? Do you really not want to know what problems Toyota cars will have when driving on Chinese roads, especially in southern China? With your cleverness, don't you want to improve your own cars? Don't you want to maintain your reputation and continue to please the Chinese market? Do you just want a one-time deal in China and ruin your own reputation..."

In the end, Japan had no choice but to give Zhang Xuexin a complete set of Toyota car repair shop equipment and a complete set of teaching instruments for a training center. They were clever, sending experts to Zhang Xuexin's repair shop to help with the work, eating a free Chinese meal every day, and feeding back a large amount of information about Japanese cars to the Toyota car research institute. Their products were improved every year, even every few months. The training center was also for training technicians to repair Japanese cars. All this was also beneficial to China. Zhang Xuexin's Toyota car repair shop had an annual output value of over 20 million yuan, the most complete spare parts, and became the national center for repairing imported cars.

Selling imported car parts and repairing cars were just two of the dozens of business operations Zhang Xuexin engaged in, and they were not even the main business. The main business was to be the agent for Chinese cars. Facing the enormous pressure of foreign cars, where did the Chinese cars go?

Chinese cars, as a type of production material, could only be allocated by the state, and those who did not need cars could get them, while those who really needed cars could not buy them. Cars lost their inherent "consumer goods" status. Thus, various "speculators" and "incidents" emerged one after another. Active cars could not compete with foreign car manufacturers under such a rigid management system. As the agent for Chinese cars, Zhang Xuexin had to break this situation, be the first to conduct automobile trade in China, and represent various large Chinese automobile factories to directly communicate with domestic and foreign users and the world automobile industry. Under the state's massive automobile management system, he borrowed the sharpness of openness to break through a big path, design a new form for his enterprise, and no longer get stuck in the hopeless cycle of following old methods, executing stupid policies, and cultivating stupid people. His unique and bold ideas inspired and encouraged the company's employees. By 1985, imported cars were in chaos, but Zhang Xuexin's company had already developed into an "automobile kingdom." In just a few years, the sales volume reached tens of billions, and dozens of subsidiary companies, repair shops, dealerships, and service centers were spawned.

The old saying goes, "When a person reaches fifty, they lose their courage." Zhang Xuexin's courage was fully displayed after he turned fifty. In early 1985, he established the first automobile trading company in China—the China Automobile Industry South Trade Company. In four years, he had over 150 subsidiary companies and agencies at home and abroad and was steadily and confidently developing into a powerful multinational corporation.

When the company was generally worried that if Zhang Xuexin retired, it would affect the development of the enterprise, he himself showed a modern person's detached attitude of leaving things to fate, as if his tall figure could be his own monument. He said to me, "What's the use of rushing? Everyone wants to live forever and doesn't want to get old. But everyone will have a day when they are old and confused. Isn't it better to retire while you're still clear-headed? Don't wait until you become your own enemy before stepping down!"

Zhang Xuexin indeed had the final say. Cutting him off at the peak of his life and career was not without its merits. People will miss him. The sympathetic Chinese masses will even feel sorry for him, as if they owed him something. Besides, who would want to take over his position? If you do well, people will say it's because of the foundation Zhang Xuexin laid, and the credit will still go to him. If you do poorly, people will scold you for not being worthy to polish Zhang Xuexin's shoes. The current trend is to take over a mess and turn a loss into a profit, which is considered heroic.

Given this, I really wanted to shout, "Spare his life!"

I didn't call out to Zhang Xuexin in time.

### 一堆金子

　　一堆金子
    蒋子龙
    军长给英雄们授勋，念到张学鑫的名字时竟卡壳了，吭哧了半天忽然惊天动地地吼出：“大尉张学——堆”！他不认识这个“鑫”字。既然是一堆金子，就想当然地认为应该念“堆”。
    最初吸引我的却不是张学鑫，而是张学鑫手下几百个干部中的一个普通中层干部——公关部经理刘新生。且慢，不要一见“公关”两个字就想到漂亮的女性。我也确实见过一些能干的公关小姐。缘于此，眼前这位“公关汉子”才让我惊奇。他谈不上英俊，只能说端正；绝不魁伟，但很磁实。严肃正规得像男性的精装本，老实可靠得近于僵直铁硬。他的公关辞令总让我想起部队上操的口令，从服饰到骨子有一派军人气度。他能引起我的兴趣就说明他的公关学是成功的。一年多以前他还是空军特级飞行员、飞行团长，飞了十八年没出过一次事故，连险肇事故也没有发生。我问：“你喜欢公关部的工作？”
    “喜欢。”
    “十八年的飞行经验能派上用场？还是飞行和公关之间有什么联系？”
    “恰恰相反，飞行员的生活是全封闭的。回到地面一切为了上天做准备，上了天就忘了地面，忘了人间。在地面上穿飞行衣，上了天坐密封舱，飞行要求我们的生活必须单调，一天２４小时，一年３６５天，都必须集中精神想飞行。不知夜总会、酒巴、花花世界为何物。而公关部是开放的，我需要过一种开放的生活。”
    “张总经理对你的工作满意吗？”
    “没有表示不满意。”
    我想张学鑫是满意的。这样的公关部经理给人以安全可靠足以信赖的感觉。张学鑫真会用人，可谓“出奇制胜”。刘新生是不是张学鑫那“一堆金子”中的一块？
    由此生发，张学鑫周围的人讲了许多他用人的故事。他是有个性的，不把对自己的顺从当作挑选干部的主要条件。
    当年他曾当过电台台长，常被师长叫去打扑克。自己输了规规矩矩钻桌子，师长输了却不肯放下架子从桌子底下爬过去。他仗着自己身大力猛硬是捺着师长的脑袋塞到桌子底下，为此激怒了师长也不在乎。
    １９８５年初，刚竖起大牌子的中国汽车工业南方贸易公司生不逢时，国家银根紧缩，再加上轰动海内外的“海南汽车事件”，中国式的一刀切文件下来了，广东的汽车一辆不许卖！
    已经成为汽车大亨的张学鑫，手里还存着数千台汽车，仓库的大停车场上排着整齐的钢铁方阵，在阳光下闪着五颜六色的光泽，看一眼就让人眼晕！７０００万元的资金被积压，整个公司成了一盘死棋，上上下下焦心如焚。张学鑫走到哪里都像一团带着雷电的云彩——他在酿制自己的雷电。“南贸”公司好像很大，其实单薄得很，只能听凭国家政治经济气候的左右，外界刮风自己就得跟着摇晃，外面降温自己也得受寒。将来应该强大到自成气候，甚至能反过来影响国家的政治经济气候。他要把自己的干部都?起来，掏出去。号令是这样发出的：“这一仗打不赢就得输掉整个战争。在企业竞争中不存在理解和同情。商品经济可不是一个温柔慈爱的等待你慢慢成熟的温室，优胜劣汰，残酷无情。要寻找挑战接受挑战，把灾难和不幸变成发展自己的机会……”
    张学鑫用男子汉才气纵横的手段和作风领导企业、指挥干部。他的汽车贸易公司是全国第一家，连政府的高级官员们也用一种新奇的眼光注视着它。这公司是张学鑫创建的，在公司的形象里太深地印上了他的性格。一把手的个性往往就是企业的个性，不承认这个性或抹灭这个性就会伤害企业。在这样崭新的事业面前，创造远胜于经验，经验至少不起主要作用。
    因此，在张学鑫手下干事只会听话是不行的，很可能还是危险的。在他的公司里墨守陈规没有前途，必须去闯，去找到属于自己的职位。总经理办公室的女秘书陈前绣首先坐不住了，毛遂自荐要北上面君。这位学铁路工程的１９５８年中专毕业生，朴实，外柔内刚，带着一种焦虑，一种控制得恰到好处的义愤，决心先找国家物资总局的头头，不行再找国务院、党中央。她只想说明一个简单的事实：南方贸易公司里的汽车不同于什么事件里的汽车，它是从正路买来的，冻结积压在仓库里受损失的也将是国家。她站在总局所属的机电局长的背后讲了两个多小时，那位深感为难的局长竟没有回过头来认真看看她。局长下班了，她又跟到人家家里。她相信只要人跟人之间的感情能够流通起来，物资也会流通的。
    事在人为。陈前绣一个月里五次进京，一年有半年在外，工资奖金全用做差旅费了。她的诚意终于打动了铁板一块的中国体制，在物资总局机电局长的帮助下，国家承认南方贸易公司售销汽车的合法性。陈前绣马不卸鞍，当年售出国产汽车２４００台，第二年售出３０００台。“南贸”一盘死棋开始变活，又一位具有创业气质的经营人才闯炼成熟。张学鑫任命陈前绣为南方贸易公司副总经理兼销售部经理。
    开放的力量和自由造就了张学鑫。他也给下面的人提供足够的支持和自由施展的天地，因此而吸引了一大批精兵强将。
    在我面前称张学鑫为“老板”，跟他配合默契的党委书记兼副总经理施兆龙，面色红润，头发梳理得很整齐，穿一身有板有眼的灰色中山装——广东人把这种衣服叫做“共干装”。现在大街上难得看见有人穿它，但穿在施兆龙的身上却与他的气质极为和谐。他自信，见过世面，曾在香港当过四年华粤公司的经理。干部们都有点怕他。据说广东有了一种新风俗，不带东西不能串门。职工们找他办事则不许提东西，提了东西也要自己再提走，不提走他就从窗户扔出去。我当面打问此事，他自有独到的见解：
    “违犯纪律的人怕我，说明我是对的。没有违犯纪律的人怕我，说明我太严肃。当今社会轻浮，为人难得严肃。我严肃一点有什么不好？”
    我又问：“一般人认为配班子要一强一弱才会和谐。你和张总都很强，为什么如此协调一致？”
    “共产党是执政党，怎么会政强党弱？目标一致就能协调好。人和物不一样，物硬碰硬还要损伤，人有灵魂，要刚柔相济。我的工作就是要保证总经理的管理顺畅。当书记要会协调，会用人，会组织，会表扬，会批评。”
    还有“进口大王”、“汽车大全”、“金融魔术师”、“汽车大夫”等等。南贸公司真是由一堆金子堆成的。张学鑫无疑是这堆金子的顶尖。
    这个名副其实的山东大汉，大头颅，长脸型，眼神灼灼逼人，站在人群里高出一头，看人须弯腰，要不就得低头，久而久之养成耸肩缩腰的习惯，酷似舞台上钟馗的造型。他的举止潇洒自如，也许是各种各样的困难和意想不到的麻烦对他不断地挑战，使他保持年轻，保持强健和灵活——不论精神和身体都如此。一张嘴满口胶东腔，轻声细语，慢条斯理，与他那大个子的体魄极不协调。
    他１９７１年调来汽车配件公司（南方贸易公司的前身）。１９８１年初，汽车配件公司的经理调走，张学鑫受权主持公司的全面工作。他的时机来了！但公司每年亏损２９万元，由于以前的好大喜功或经营思想混乱，搞了几家不伦不类的汽车厂，生产了一些无人知晓的杂牌汽车，质次、价高，很像大跃进时土法上马的产物。无法跟国内的汽车大厂竞争，更谈不上抵挡排山倒海般涌进的外国汽车。一阵风似地垮了，包袱背在张学鑫肩上。
    他受命于公司的危难之际也许也是一种幸运！诸多压力顺势迸发，他不得不担当起重新创造的责任，开辟新的前途。
    “推开窗户一看，满地都是日本车”——真是“有路就有丰田车”！抵制不行，感慨无用，要紧的是正视现实，在被动中争取主动。他派人把住广东九个交通要冲，统计过往汽车的流量和型号。三个月的路测结果表明，进口汽车占广东汽车保有量的４０％，使用率却特别高，占车流量的７０％。这些车会损坏，会出毛病。张学鑫试探性地进口了２００万美元的外国汽车配件。这不是一笔小买卖，更何况外汇是提着脑袋做抵押借来的。
    张学鑫有追求冒险的天性。而现代经营诀窍就是在冒险中取得报酬。他进口的汽车配件很快销售一空。第二年，仅此一项的营业额达到１．９亿元。第三年３亿元。
    “现在有条件也有资格跟日本人谈谈了。”——张学鑫三下日本。按照惯例，中国买了日本这么多汽车，日本应该向中国免费提供修理设备。丰田汽车公司对发达国家就是这么做的。他们之所以对中国装聋作哑，一是欺侮中国人老实，二是认为中国人掌握不了他们的维修技术。
    张学鑫在外国人面前，气岸勇迈，钟馗肩高耸，额头眼角堆出一团略带嘲讽意味的不好惹的皱纹。他本人不要任何东西，包括谢绝那些极力想坐到他身边对他动手动脚的女人。他不是来开洋荤、来乞求施舍的，而是要求得到应该得到的东西：“日本汽车在中国的分布和流动情况你们掌握吗？丰田汽车在中国道路上行驶会有什么问题，尤其是在中国南方的道路上行驶容易发生什么问题，你们真的不想知道？以你们的精明不想改进自己的汽车？不想维护信誉继续讨好中国市场？就想一锤子买卖在中国砸了自己的招牌……”
    最后日本只能赠送给张学鑫一座丰田汽车修理厂整套设备和一所培训中心的全套教学仪器。他们很精，派专家来张学鑫的修理厂帮助工作，每天中午白吃一顿中国饭，将获得的大量有关日本汽车的信息反馈给丰田汽车研究所。他们的产品每年甚至每隔几个月就有新的改进。培训中心也是培养修理日本汽车的技术工人。这一切对中国也有好处。张学鑫的丰田汽车修理厂每年产值２０００多万元，备件最齐全，成了全国的进口汽车修理中心。
    销售进口汽车配件、修理汽车只是张学鑫几十种经营业务中的两项，并且不是最主要的经营项目。最主要的是做中国的汽车代理商。面对外国车的巨大压力，中国车到哪里去了？
    中国汽车做为一类生产物资只能由国家统一调拨，不需要汽车的可以分到汽车，真正需要汽车的买不到汽车，汽车丧失了应有的“消费品格”。于是各种“倒爷”、“事件”层出不穷。活动的汽车在这种僵死的体制管理下根本无力和外国汽车厂商竞争。作为中国的汽车代理商，张学鑫就要打破这种局面，率先在中国进行汽车贸易，由他代表中国各大汽车厂直接跟国内外用户对话，跟世界汽车工业对话。在国家庞大的汽车管理体制下他借开放的锐气冲出一条大道，为自己的企业设计出新形式，再不钻进那种沿袭蠢法走蠢路、执行蠢政策培养蠢材的毫无希望的循环。他奇特而大胆的思想吸引和鼓舞了公司的职工。到１９８５年，进口汽车乱了套，张学鑫的公司却已经发展成一个“汽车王国”。短短几年，销售额达到十几个亿，下面又派生出几十个分公司、修理厂、经销部、服务中心等。
    老话说，人到５０岁就没有胆子了。张学鑫的胆子到５０岁以后才得以淋漓尽致的发挥。１９８５年初，他创立了中国第一个汽车贸易公司——中国汽车工业南方贸易公司。４年来，他在国内外有了１５０多家分公司和代销部，正稳步地充满信心地向实力雄厚的跨国公司发展。
    当公司上下普遍担心，假若张学鑫退休必然会影响企业的发展时。他本人却表现出现代人超脱的听天由命的态度，仿佛他那副高大的身架就可以做自己的纪念碑。他对我说：“急有什么用。谁都想长生，不愿年老。但人总有老迈昏庸的那一天，趁现在明白退下来不是好事吗？不要等到自己成了自己的敌人的时候再下台！”
    张学鑫果然有绝的。在他生命和事业的鼎盛时期把他“切”掉，未尝不是成全了他。人们会怀念他。富于同情心的中国群众甚至会感到对不住他，欠了他什么。再说，有哪个聪明人愿意接他的班呢？干好了，人家认为是张学鑫打下的基础，功劳仍旧记在他的帐上。干坏了，人家会骂你给张学鑫提鞋都不合格。当今的时髦是接收烂摊子，扭亏为盈就是英雄。
    鉴于此，我真想冒叫一声：“刀下留人！”
    不叫张学鑫算得太准。
