A serious boat capsizing accident occurred in the Tongshan County section of the Grand Canal today. By 8 PM when this report was filed, 11 people had been rescued, 9 of whom were dead, and 2 were sent to the hospital for emergency treatment.

According to the boatman, this was a manually operated ferry boat. In the afternoon at 2 PM, dozens of villagers from Maocun Township, who were on their way to a temple fair, rushed onto the boat upon seeing a light rain. The boat capsized due to overloading, and it is still unclear how many people fell into the water. The rescue operation is still ongoing.

    新华社南京５月１２日电（通讯员周新民）今天下午，江苏省铜山县境内大运河中口渡口发生一起恶性翻船事故，至晚上八时发稿时止，已打捞上１１人，其中９人死亡，２人送医院抢救。
    据船工说，这是一只人工摆渡铁船，下午２时，四五十名在茅村乡赶庙会的乡民见下起小雨，匆匆拥挤上船，渡船因超载而翻沉，究竟有多少人落水还不清楚。目前打捞工作仍在进行中。
