A report from a "Women's Information Center" in West Germany:

The Tragedy of Modern "Slave Trade"

After humanity entered the 1980s, a new form of "slave trade"—the trafficking of female slaves (or the "kidnapping of women")—has emerged in many countries, growing from non-existent to significant in scale. In recent years, it has even reached a shocking and appalling extent.

In economically advanced West Germany, the issue of female slave trafficking is quite serious. Women from several Asian countries and many other developing countries in the world are lured there by various means. Most of these women were unmarried before leaving their homes. According to estimates from relevant departments in the West German capital of Bonn, currently, more than 10,000 such women are lured to West Germany each year.

Some of these women are deceived by swindlers in their home regions with promises of studying, working, becoming nurses, serving as maids, or marrying trustworthy Germans. Others are lured by people from West Germany who travel to their home regions for tourism or business with various enticements. Upon arriving in West Germany, some of these women are forced to register in the "red-light districts" as legal prostitutes; others are coerced into being illegal streetwalkers in other parts of society. Some are forced against their will to "marry" men they do not love. Some "grooms" are disabled, while others are elderly, weak, and wrinkled old men. Many men purchase these women as casually as buying ordinary goods in a store, selecting them at will, paying the money, and taking the "goods" home.

These women have effectively been taken over by others, losing their personal freedom and becoming slaves, often subjected to unrestrained abuse and unbearable humiliation. Some have contracted syphilis, gonorrhea, lymphogranuloma venereum, and other sexually transmitted diseases, and some have even contracted AIDS.

These modern slaves, stranded in a foreign land far from their homeland and loved ones, find themselves in a situation where they are alone and helpless. When encountering danger, they often find that heaven does not respond to their cries, and the earth does not answer their calls. Additionally, due to language barriers, unfamiliar food, and difficulty adapting to the environment, many are extremely sad and deeply distressed. Some have gone mad, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, a sight that is hard to bear. Some have attempted suicide multiple times, wishing to end their lives.

In response to this urgent and bloody social issue, the state of Baden-Württemberg in West Germany established the "Stuttgart Women's Information Center" in the state capital of Stuttgart at the end of 1987, which is quite noteworthy. The state government provides the center with 50,000 Marks annually.

The center's staff organizes these female slaves, regularly meets with them, provides German language training classes, helps them connect with each other, and offers extensive consultations on legal, social, employment, health, and child-rearing issues. This helps them solve various difficulties in their daily lives and consider how to escape their predicaments.

In 1988 alone, the Stuttgart Women's Information Center helped more than 50 desperate women escape their dire situations and provided advice and information to more than 250 other victims to help improve their circumstances. However, many people in Baden-Württemberg are still unaware of this consultation center, and some victims, although aware of its existence, lack the courage to seek help from its staff due to various pressures.

Since the beginning of 1989, women's organizations, social groups, and individuals from various sectors in West Germany and some other countries have increasingly written letters, made phone calls, sent telegrams, or dispatched people to learn about the center's scientific approach to handling issues and the various problems encountered in its practical work.

### 来自西德一个“妇女信息中心”的报道：  现代“奴隶贸易”的悲剧

　　来自西德一个“妇女信息中心”的报道：
    现代“奴隶贸易”的悲剧
    在人类进入２０世纪８０年代以后，以新形式出现的“奴隶贸易”——女性奴隶贸易（或曰“拐卖妇女”），在不少国家，从无到有，规模由小变大，近年来，甚至发展到了触目惊心、令人发指的地步。
    在经济高度发达的西德，目前女性奴隶贸易问题相当严重。一些亚洲国家以及世界其他不少发展中国家的妇女，被以种种手段拐骗到了那里。这些妇女在离家之前大多数是未婚的姑娘。据西德首都波恩有关部门估算，现在每年有１万多名这样的妇女被诱至西德。
    她们中有的人，是被原在地区的骗子以介绍去读书、做工、当护士、做保姆或嫁给讲信义的德国人等甜言蜜语骗去的，有的是被从西德到她们原在地区旅游或做生意的人以种种诱饵骗去的。到了西德后，她们中有的人被强迫到“红灯区”去登记注册，当合法的娼妓；有的人被逼着去社会其他地方做非法的暗娼，有的则被胁迫违反自己的意愿，跟自己根本不爱的男人“结婚”。有的“新郎”是残废人，有的“新郎”是年迈孱弱、满脸皱纹的老头儿。很多男人购买她们时，就像在商场里购买普通商品一样，随意挑拣，选定后，一手交钱，一手交“货”，然后带人回家。
    这些妇女实际上都已被他人占有，失去了人身自由，沦为奴隶，常常横遭肆无忌惮的虐待和无法忍受的凌辱。有的人被传染上了梅毒、淋病、淋巴肉芽肿等性行为传播的疾病，有的甚至染上了艾滋病。
    这些现代奴隶身在异国他乡，远离祖国和亲人，处于举目无亲、孤立无援的境地。遇到危险时，往往呼天天不应，叫地地不灵；再加上语言不通，食物不习惯，水土不服等原因，许多人非常忧伤，极为悲痛。有的人疯了，披头散发，污首垢面，其状令人目不忍睹。有的人则数度产生轻生之念，欲一死了之。
    针对这种充满血泪而又十分急迫的社会问题，西德巴登·符腾堡州于１９８７年底在首府斯图加特市设立了一个令人注目的“斯图加特妇女信息中心”，州政府每年资助该中心５万马克。
    该中心的工作人员把这些女奴组织起来，定期会见她们，为她们开办德语培训班，帮助她们互相联系，并向她们提供内容广泛的有关法律、社会、就业、卫生、养育孩子等方面的咨询服务，以利于她们解决日常生活中碰到的各种困难，并考虑如何摆脱困境。
    在１９８８年１年中，斯图加特妇女信息中心帮助了５０多名处于绝望中的妇女脱离了险境，并向其他２５０多名受害者提供了有助于改善她们处境的建议和信息。但巴登·符腾堡州迄今尚有不少人不知道有这样一个咨询中心，有的受害者虽然知道有这个中心，可是慑于各方面的压力，没有勇气去找那里的工作人员要求咨询。
    自１９８９年初以来，西德各州及世界上一些国家越来越多的妇女组织、社会团体和各界人士纷纷写信、打电话、发电报或派人去了解这个咨询中心以科学态度处理问题的经验，以及该中心在实际工作中遇到的形形色色的问题。
