Businessmen from Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States, West Germany, Thailand, and the United Kingdom have expressed their desire to cooperate with Guangzhou in 23 industries, including agriculture, transportation, textiles, food, light industry, arts and crafts, construction, metallurgy, shipbuilding, computer disks, and real estate development, to establish 78 enterprises. This information was obtained from Guangzhou's first foreign investment information release meeting held recently.

Before the information release meeting, a reporter from the *Yangcheng Evening News* interviewed Guangzhou's Deputy Mayor, Lei Yu. He summarized the characteristics of Guangzhou's use of foreign capital in the more than half a year since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee with nine words: momentum strong, depth deep, endurance powerful.

Lei Yu said that from October last year to March this year, the city signed contracts to utilize $340 million in foreign capital and actually utilized $94 million. The monthly average amount increased by 124% and 87% respectively compared to the average amount from January to September last year. He said that several large American conglomerates have already signed agreements to invest, and high-end branded products such as Pepsi-Cola concentrate, Gillette razor blades, Wrigley's chewing gum, and Singer sewing machines, as well as companies like DuPont, P&G, and Polaroid, are all setting up factories in Guangzhou. More than 10 old enterprises, including Guangzhou Steel Plant and Guangzhou Soap Factory, are using foreign capital for technological transformation. At the same time, the structure of foreign capital utilization in the entire city is becoming more rational, with the proportion of production projects rising to 93%, the share of foreign capital reaching 56%, and the amount of exports for re-sale significantly increasing.

Lei Yu revealed that Guangzhou will soon introduce a series of new measures to attract foreign investment, including charging foreign investors for land use, selling corporate shares to foreign investors, conducting technical exchanges and operational joint ventures with foreign investors, and allowing foreign investors to develop land in large plots. This is to expand the scope of foreign capital utilization, improve the level of foreign capital utilization, and solve the problem of matching funds on the Chinese side. Currently, many foreign investors have expressed their willingness to cooperate in various aspects, and the city's work in utilizing foreign capital is expected to make greater progress than last year.

He emphasized that currently, a global industrial restructuring is underway, and we must seize this opportunity. Countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines are all rushing to attract foreign investment. If we do not seize this international opportunity with all our might, if we do not insist on the "two unshakable" policies, if we are deterred by the difficulties that have emerged from the rectification and adjustment, or even hesitate and falter, we will surely miss this good opportunity and regret it!

　　势头强　层次深　后劲足    
    广州抓住良机引进外资    
    半年签合同３．４亿美元　吸引外资将有新措施
    本报讯  来自台湾、香港、美国、联邦德国、泰国和英国等地的客商，希望与穗方合作，在广州的农业、交通、纺织、食品、轻工、工艺、建筑、金属、船舶、计算机磁盘和房地产开发等２３个行业中，兴办７８家企业。这个信息，是从日前广州首次召开的外商投资信息发布会上获悉的。
    《羊城晚报》记者在信息发布会之前采访了广州市副市长雷宇。他用９个字概括了党的十三届三中全会以后的半年多来，广州市利用外资的鲜明特点，这就是：势头强、层次深、后劲足。
    雷宇说，从去年１０月到今年３月，全市合同利用外资３．４亿美元，实际利用外资０．９４亿美元，每月平均额比去年１—９月平均额分别增长１２４％和８７％。他说，美国几家大的集团公司业已签约投资，百事可乐浓缩液、吉列刀片、绿箭香口胶、胜家缝纫机等高档名牌商品的生产企业和杜邦、Ｐ＆Ｇ、波尔公司等都纷纷来穗设厂。广州钢铁厂、广州肥皂厂等１０多个老企业正在利用外资投入搞技术改造。同时，广州全市利用外资结构更趋合理，生产性项目比例升至９３％，外资份额达到５６％，出口返销量显著增加。
    雷宇透露，广州市即将出台一批吸引外资的新措施，其中包括对外商实行土地有偿使用、向外商出让企业股权、与外商开展技术交换和经营联合、让外商承包土地成片开发等，以便扩大利用外资的领域，提高利用外资的水平和解决利用外资的中方配套资金问题。目前，还有大批外商表达了多方面的合作意向，全市利用外资工作可望比去年有更大的进展。
    他强调，目前，世界性的产业结构调整正在进行，机不可失，泰国、印尼、马来西亚、菲律宾等国正在抓紧引进外资。如果我们不千方百计把握好这一国际机遇，不坚持贯彻“两个坚定不移”的方针，被治理整顿出现的一些困难吓住，甚至徘徊观望，裹足不前，势必坐失良机，后悔莫及！
