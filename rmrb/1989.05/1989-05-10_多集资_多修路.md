More Funding, More Roads

    By Wang Yuanfeng, Director of Chengdu Railway Bureau

    How can the railway sector get out of its difficulties? The solution lies in raising more funds and building more roads. Over the past few years, the three provinces in Southwest China have widely propagated and consulted with local governments and industrial enterprises, mobilizing funds from multiple levels to jointly develop railways. This has opened up a new situation.

    The Wannan Railway, with a total length of 38 kilometers, is jointly funded by the railway, energy sector, and provincial, municipal, and county governments with a total investment of 77.4 million yuan. It is scheduled to be completed and put into operation next year. The Longlu Railway, with a total length of 49.3 kilometers, is jointly funded by the railway and local governments with an investment of 80 million yuan. It is operated under a joint venture model and construction began in December last year. The Kunyu Railway, with a total length of 55 kilometers, is funded solely by the local government. The construction plan has been reviewed and the preliminary design is awaiting approval. The Yunnan Provincial Government has submitted a proposal to build the Guangda Railway, which is 213 kilometers long with an estimated total investment of 670 million yuan. It is proposed to be funded by the railway, the province, and loans that the province is responsible for repaying, each contributing one-third of the investment.

    However, it should be noted that the backbone of the railway network in Southwest China is not yet fully formed. Currently, it is necessary to adjust the industrial structure of the national economy, accelerate railway construction, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the central government, local governments, and enterprises.

　　多集资　多修路
    成都铁路局局长  王源峰
    铁路走出困境，出路何在？只有多集资多修路。西南三省经过几年来向地方政府和厂矿企业广泛宣传协商，多层次集资，合资合营发展铁路的局面已经打开。由铁路、能源和省地县共同投资七千七百四十万元、总长三十八公里的万（盛）南（川）铁路将于明年建成通车，由铁路和地方投资八千万元、总长四十九点三公里，实行联营的隆（昌）泸（州）铁路已于去年十二月动工修建；由地方政府单独投资，总长五十五公里的昆（明）玉（溪）铁路修建方案已论证完毕，初步设计待审查；云南省政府已将修建广（通）大（理）铁路项目建议书上报，该线总长二百一十三公里，总投资预计六点七亿元，拟由铁路和省及省负责偿还的贷款各三分之一的投资方式进行修建；车辆不足，云贵川三省和重庆市已作出购置自备车和建立自备车管理体制的决定。
    但是应当看到，目前西南铁路网骨架尚未完全形成，当前必须调整国民经济发展的产业结构，加快铁路建设，发挥中央、地方和企业的积极性。
