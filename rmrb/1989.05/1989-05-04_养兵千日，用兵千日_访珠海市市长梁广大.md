“Train soldiers for a thousand days, use them for a thousand days” — An Interview with Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda
New China News Agency Reporter Li Shiyuan

“You ask me why I emphasize supporting the military. The reason is simple. A country without defense cannot stand, and people without an army cannot be secure. The PLA stationed here is itself a deterrent against external threats and a stabilizing force internally.” “The Great Wall protects the country, and we protect the Great Wall,” said Zhuhai Mayor Liang Guangda, lighting a cigarette, speaking to the reporter.

	“Without the children of the soldiers, there is no sense of security. The common people cannot do without the People's Liberation Army!”

Zhuhai, known as the "Pearl of the South China Sea," is adjacent to Hong Kong to the east and connected to Macau by land to the south. It has been a strategic location since ancient times. The vast expanse of blue sea, with islands scattered like stars, and hundreds of ships navigating through it. In the summer of 1950, the PLA marched south to Zhuhai, liberated the Wanshan Islands, and braved gunfire and bullets to rescue the people from their dire straits. Tens of thousands of soldiers fought bravely, their blood staining the blue sea. The martyrs' monument on Guishan Island still stirs people's memories and respect for the soldiers. Afterwards, the PLA stationed on the islands, fishermen cast their nets, and soldiers patrolled and protected the waters. The thousand-mile sea area formed a beautiful picture of military-civilian unity.

There is one thing that makes Liang Guangda's thoughts wander: a small island far out in the Pacific Ocean, with only 0.6 square kilometers of land. During the Japanese imperialist invasion of China, the island was occupied, and there was burning, killing, and looting. No one on the island escaped except those who went out to sea to fish. After the founding of the People's Republic, people lived and multiplied on the island under the protection of the PLA. “It seems that the army is the mainstay of the people's peaceful life. Whether in wartime or peacetime, we cannot do without the children of the soldiers; the common people cannot do without the army!”

Developing a commodity economy requires a good investment environment, and first of all, there must be a peaceful social environment. Liang Guangda told the reporter that after Zhuhai became a special economic zone, it introduced more than 1100 foreign investment projects, with a total agreed investment of $380 million. Last year, the industrial and agricultural output value increased by 83.3% over the previous year, national income and foreign trade exports increased by more than 50%, and fiscal revenue doubled. Zhuhai, from a poor and backward coastal town, rapidly developed into a modern city of considerable size. An important factor in this was that, with the help of the PLA, a peaceful and harmonious social environment was created.

	“Soldiers endure wind and rain to guard the seas. I want to personally thank them.”

Zhuhai, with its strategically important location, has many military units. Liang Guangda often reminds the relevant departments, “We have many troops here, which is a blessing for all the people in the city. If the troops have any difficulties, they should be solved promptly.”

Mayor Liang Guangda is a model of leading by example in supporting the military. He also serves as the first political commissar of the Zhuhai Garrison Command, frequently inquiring about the situation of the troops, reporting local information, and visiting the islands to comfort the soldiers and guide the construction of military facilities. Last spring festival, the municipal government organized a delegation to visit the soldiers on the island. The mayor was busy with work, and everyone advised him not to go. Liang Guangda said, “The soldiers endure wind and rain to guard the seas. I want to personally thank them.” Due to the strong winds, he got lost on his way back by boat and did not arrive home until 2 a.m. Last summer, Liang Guangda was invited to observe the naval parade of the shipping company. The ships cut through the wind and waves like arrows. Liang Guangda was moved by the soldiers' vigorous appearance, but at the same time, he felt guilty for them enduring 40°C high temperatures living in the deck cabins of landing ships. After the parade, Liang Guangda asked the military leaders, “The weather is so hot, can the soldiers live on land?” The military comrades said, “If they do not go to sea, the soldiers can live on land, but there is no money to build houses.” Liang Guangda decided on the spot to allocate 100,000 yuan to build the "sailors' building." The Xiangzhou Rest Home houses more than 40 retired cadres, including old Red Army soldiers and old Eighth Route Army soldiers. In August last year, Liang Guangda came to the rest home to participate in the awarding ceremony for the retired cadres. The "parental officials" came, and the retired cadres reflected on the problems of water seepage in the houses, no cars for outings, and no telephones. Liang Guangda's expression was serious. He immediately convened a meeting of municipal leaders and instructed the relevant departments to quickly solve the problem of water seepage in the houses of the retired cadres, to equip the rest home with two sleeper cars and one agricultural vehicle, and to install an automatic telephone for each retired cadre.

Under the leadership of the municipal leaders, the people of Zhuhai respect, love, and support the PLA, creating a strong atmosphere.

	“The most precious thing is that whenever there is danger or difficulty, it is always the PLA that charges to the front.”

Liang Guangda said that with the development of reform and opening up and the commodity economy, in the special zone, the living standards of the people have improved significantly, while the living standards of the troops have fallen behind somewhat. We cannot turn a blind eye to the difficulties of the troops or ignore them. He said that in peacetime, local governments and party organizations have the responsibility to care for and protect the interests of soldiers and cannot push the difficulties to higher levels. Some people think that the army does nothing when it is not fighting and is just eating idle food in peacetime. Liang Guangda, however, believes that the traditional idea of "training soldiers for a thousand days, using them for a moment" must be changed. With the development of productive forces and intense international competition, it should be "training soldiers for a thousand days, using them for a thousand days."

In recent years, the Zhuhai garrison has made great contributions to the construction of the special zone, providing 17 islands to the local government for development and lending more than 20,000 square meters of barracks and 16 military wharves for local use. The troops, while ensuring the completion of educational and training tasks, participated in the construction of more than 60 key projects, including Wanshan Port, Guishan Wharf, underwater cables, and the Jiuzhou Port Expressway. They also relocated 20 facilities, tunnels, and some communication lines that were not conducive to economic construction, and dispatched vehicles and ships more than 1,800 times for local transportation. “The most precious thing is that whenever there is danger or difficulty, it is always the PLA that charges to the front.” Last August, during the typhoon season, 8,000 tons of grain urgently needed to be unloaded from a ship docked in the harbor, but there were no dock workers available. The garrison heard about it and volunteered. Seven companies worked tirelessly for three days and nights, preventing the grain from being damaged. Speaking of this, Liang Guangda gratefully said, the PLA and the people are of one heart. In peacetime, although there is no war, the children of the soldiers stand guard and patrol the border and coastal defenses day and night, rescue and relieve disasters, and serve the people. Which day is not using the soldiers!

### “养兵千日，用兵千日”——访珠海市市长梁广大

　　“养兵千日，用兵千日”   
     ——访珠海市市长梁广大
    新华社记者  李石元
    “你问我为什么抓拥军，道理很简单。国无防不立，民无兵不安。解放军驻守这地方，本身就是一种对外威慑，对内稳定的力量。”“‘长城’护国土，我们护‘长城’”珠海市市长梁广大点燃一支烟，对记者侃侃而谈。
    　　　　“没有子弟兵，没有安全感，老百姓离不开人民军队啊！”
    素有“南海明珠”的珠海，东与香港隔海相望，南与澳门陆地相连，自古乃兵家必争之地。万顷碧波的大海，岛屿星罗棋布，百船穿梭其间。１９５０年夏，解放军南下珠海，解放万山群岛，冒枪林弹雨救民于水深火热之中，数万人英勇作战，血染碧海。耸立在桂山岛的烈士纪念碑至今激起人们对子弟兵的怀念与崇敬。之后，解放军驻守海岛，渔民撒网捕鱼，战士巡逻护航，千里海域构成一幅美妙的军民鱼水图。
    有一件事使梁广大思绪万千：远靠太平洋的一个小岛，只有０．６平方公里的土地。当年日本帝国主义侵略中国时，霸占该岛，烧杀抢掠，无恶不作。岛上除出海打鱼的外，无一人幸免。共和国成立后，人们在解放军的保卫下，又在岛上繁衍生息。“看来，军队是人民安居乐业的主心骨，不管是战争年代还是和平时期，咱们没有子弟兵，没有安全感，老百姓离不开军队啊！
    发展商品经济，讲究投资环境，首先的是要有一个安宁的社会环境。梁广大告诉记者，珠海办特区后，引进外资１１００多项，协议投资总额达３．８亿美元，去年工农业产值比上年增长８３．３％，国民收入、外贸出口增长５０％以上，财政收入增长了一倍。珠海从一个贫穷落后的沿海小镇迅速发展成为初具规模的现代化城市，一个重要因素，就是在解放军的协助下，创造了一个安宁和谐的社会环境。
    　　　　“战士栉风沐雨守海防，我要亲自对他们说句感谢的话。”
    战略位置十分重要的珠海，驻军单位较多。梁广大经常告诫办事部门，“我们这里部队多，是全市人民的福气，部队有什么困难，要及时解决”。
    市长梁广大就是带头拥军的模范。他兼任珠海警备区第一政委，时时过问部队情况，通报地方信息，多次上岛慰问战士，指导军事设施的修建。前年春节，市政府组织慰问团上岛慰问战士，市长工作忙，大家劝他不要去。梁广大说，“战士栉风沐雨守海防，我要亲自对他们说句感谢的话。”由于风浪大，他乘船返回时迷航了，深夜两点才到家。去年夏天，梁广大应邀参观船运大队的水上阅兵。舰艇如飞，劈风斩浪，梁广大被战士们英姿勃勃的风貌所感动，同时又为他们冒４０℃的高温住在登陆舰的甲板舱里而内疚。阅兵完毕，梁广大问部队领导，“天气那么热，战士可不可以住在陆地上？”部队同志说，“不出海，战士可以住在陆地上，就是无钱盖房子。”梁广大当场拍板，拨款１０万元，修建“水兵楼”。香洲干休所，住着４０多位老干部，有老红军、老八路。去年８月，梁广大来到干休所参加老干部授勋。“父母官”来了，老干部反映房屋渗水，外出无车，电话不通的问题。梁广大神情凝重。他马上召集市里领导开会，责成有关部门尽快解决老干部房屋渗水问题，为干休所配备两部卧车和一辆农用车，给每个老干部安装一部自动电话机。
    在市领导的带动下，珠海人民尊重解放军、热爱解放军、支持解放军蔚然成风。
    　　　　“最可贵的是，每当危险关头和困难时候，总是解放军冲锋在前。”
    梁广大说，随着改革开放和商品经济的发展，在特区，人民群众的生活有了很大改善，而部队的生活却拉开了一些距离。对于部队的困难，我们不能视而不见，置之不理。他说，和平时期，地方政府和党组织有责任关心和维护军人的利益，不能把困难推到上面去。当前有些人觉的军队不打仗没事干，平时养着吃闲饭。梁广大却认为“养兵千日，用兵一时的传统观念必须改变，随着生产力的发展，国际竞争的强烈，应该是养兵千日，用兵千日。”
    几年来，珠海驻军为特区的建设作了大量贡献，先后提供１７个岛屿给地方开发，借出２万多平方米的营房、１６座军用码头给地方使用。部队在保证教育训练任务完成的前提下，参加了万山港、桂山码头、海底电缆、九洲港高速公路等６０多项重点工程建设，还对２０个不利于经济建设的工事、坑道和一些通信线路进行了换点改道，出动车船１８００多次为地方运输。“最可贵的是，每当危险关头和困难时候，总是解放军冲锋在前。”去年８月，正遇台风季节，停泊在港湾的８０００吨粮食急需卸船，码头一时找不到装卸工，驻军知道了，主动请战。７个连队连续苦战三昼夜，使粮食免遭损失。谈到这些，梁广大感激地说，解放军和人民心心相印，和平时期虽然没有仗打，子弟兵日日夜夜在边海防站岗巡逻，抢险救灾，服务于民，哪一天不在用兵呢！
