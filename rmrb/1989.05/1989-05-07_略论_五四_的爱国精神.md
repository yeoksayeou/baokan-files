A Brief Discussion on the Patriotic Spirit of the May Fourth Movement

Patriotism was one of the main contents and characteristics of the May Fourth Movement. The patriotic spirit of the May Fourth Movement had a deeper historical significance and more complex ideological content compared to the previous "reform to preserve the nation" movement and the "support the Qing and expel the foreigners" Boxer Movement. However, for a long time, its deep-seated complex consciousness has been little noticed.

At a time when the republic was merely a hollow name and the results of the Xinhai Revolution were disappointing, a group of intellectuals with new knowledge and a sense of historical mission began to reflect on and explore the causes of failure. They attempted to delve beyond the surface political phenomena and explore the roots of failure in a broader cultural context. Thus, a New Culture Movement, aimed at criticizing traditional culture and promoting democracy and science to "transform the national character," was initiated.

However, the difficulty lay in the fact that the weapons they used for enlightenment—democracy and science—came precisely from the Western countries that were invading China and threatening its existence. Thus, a sharp contradiction was placed before them: they had to oppose invasion and rise to save the nation, while also using Western culture to criticize their own indigenous culture. Therefore, they had to further explore what the nation was, what patriotism was, and whether this nation was worth loving. Chen Duxiu profoundly stated: "To ask whether we should or should not love our country, we must first ask what the country is. Originally, the country is nothing more than an organization of the people to resist external oppression and an institution to mediate internal conflicts among the people" (Chen Duxiu: "Should We Love Our Country or Not?").

Gao Yihan also wrote a series of articles in *New Youth*, exploring the origins and essence of the state and introducing various Western state theories. They enthusiastically advocated the state theory based on Western contractualism, which held that the state is a product of the will of the people. Although this view of the state as a spiritual product of the will of the people was not correct, it did break away from the mystical notions of "divine right of kings" and "the emperor is the state," and in fact criticized the theory of state worship. From this, it was inevitable to conclude that "the state is not the ultimate goal of human life." They believed that the state was not the ultimate goal of human life but rather a means to achieve it. The people and the state have the right to oppose each other; the state has rights over the people, and the people have rights over the state; the people have obligations to the state, and the state has obligations to the people. In this way, they rejected the view that the state is above everything and superior to the people, and clearly proposed that the state and the people should mutually bear rights and obligations.

Here, the vanguard of the New Culture Movement broke through the traditional Chinese ethical state view. In traditional Chinese culture, "country" and "family" are closely linked, and the "country" is just an expansion of the "family." From "distinction between men and women" comes "duty between husband and wife"; from "duty between husband and wife" comes "affection between parents and children," and from "affection between parents and children" comes "proper conduct between ruler and minister." From family ethical relationships, national political principles are gradually derived. Thus, the relationship between the individual and the state is like the relationship with the family, an inescapable ethical relationship. This ethical state view is undoubtedly incompatible with modern commodity economy society. A prerequisite for labor to become a commodity is that the laborer must be free from any personal dependence and be able to sell himself freely. The contractual state view precisely embodies and reflects this spirit. Based on this state view, Chen Duxiu excitedly said: "The state is an institution that guarantees the rights of the people and seeks the happiness of the people. If it does not do this, its existence is not worthy of honor, and its destruction is not worthy of regret" ("Love for the Country and Self-Awareness"). That is to say, there is no inherent necessary relationship between the individual and the state. When the state goes against the will of the people, the people also have the right to demand that the state act in the interests of the people. In this way, they transformed the vertical relationship between the state and the individual into a horizontal relationship. In other words, the state itself is not the goal but a means to "inspire the masses and make them fully realize their potential" and "seek to make everyone find their place."

However, although they reached the rational conclusion that if the state does not represent the interests of the people, "its existence is not worthy of honor, and its destruction is not worthy of regret," they could not emotionally sever their ties with the country where they were born and raised. This conflict between reason and emotion created a great inner turmoil for them. They sought a more fundamental way to save the nation, "to fundamentally save the nation, it is necessary to improve the national character and behavior" (Chen Duxiu: "My Patriotism"). Thus, transforming the "national character" became an urgent task for saving the nation. In this way, saving the nation and enlightenment were to some extent unified.

Facing the reality of Chinese society, Chen Duxiu lamented: "A nation's people, spiritually and materially, are so degenerate, so fallen, that even if no one attacks us, we have no face, no right to live in the world!" ("My Patriotism") Feeling sorry for their misfortune and angry at their lack of struggle was a common sentiment. Lu Xun, through the mouth of the "Madman," angrily pointed out that traditional "benevolence and righteousness" eat people, stirring strong resonance in the hearts of a generation of youth. Chen Duxiu even angrily blamed the Chinese people for "not bathing diligently, smelling worse than the dogs and horses kept by Westerners; not managing the kitchen, far from being as clean as the toilets in Europe and America.... But this is still an external filth, and the internal filth is even more terrifying to speak of" ("My Patriotism"). Thus, the only way out was to use Western modern culture to thoroughly transform or completely replace Chinese traditional culture. Surprisingly, Chen Duxiu, who vigorously advocated the spirit of science, in his turn to Marxism in 1920, enthusiastically praised Western Christianity and blamed his own country, saying: "Chinese society is numb and indifferent, not to mention other good phenomena, even the bad phenomenon of suicide is rare," and therefore "we must cultivate the sublime and great personality of Jesus and the fervent and deep emotions in our blood, to save us from the pit of coldness, darkness, and filth." He also listed ten reasons for the conflicts that arose after Christianity was introduced into China and said: "Among the ten reasons listed above, with an impartial mind, the mistakes are mostly on the part of the Chinese, and the mistakes of foreigners are only one or two. They have almost corrected these one or two mistakes" ("Christianity and the Chinese People"). From these extreme and radical words, it can be seen that they believed that the impact of Western culture on Chinese culture, although accompanied by the invasion of Western powers, had the positive significance of awakening the Chinese nation. However, in the process of breaking away from narrow patriotism and extremist nationalism, the dark reality made them inevitably fall into a sense of national nihilism.

The deeper reason why they completely and thoroughly denied Chinese traditional culture was that in their historical view, the two civilizations of the East and the West were temporal rather than spatial. They believed that "Western civilization" was progressive and developed, while "Eastern civilization" was conservative and backward, at most an exception in the historical development of mankind. "The institutions and cultural artifacts of various countries, although their forms may not be exactly the same, but those who do not think of leading their country to danger and extinction, their adherence to the common principles of the spirit, gradually tend to be consistent, and the tide of the times is irresistible. At this point, to insist on the special historical national conditions, in the hope of resisting this tide, is like having the spirit of closing the country, but without the wisdom of the world" (Chen Duxiu: "Advice to Youth"). Li Dazhao also believed that Eastern civilization was "static" and "conservative," while Western civilization was "dynamic" and "progressive" ("The Fundamental Difference Between Eastern and Western Civilizations"). It should be said that the two great civilizations of the East and the West, which developed historically under the condition of basic isolation from each other, must have great differences, so it is difficult for them to copy each other. But it is not possible to fall into cultural relativism and conclude that human culture and historical development have no commonality and no common reference system. When the Western powers used fire and sword to conquer the East and bring the world into their system, they forced people to compare different cultures and use a common standard to measure which is better and which is worse, and to make choices. Chen Duxiu, who was praised as a representative figure of the May Fourth Movement, also decisively believed that "if we decide to reform, everything should be adopted from Western new methods, and we should not use the ghost talk of national essence and national conditions to cause trouble" (Chen Duxiu: "The Political Problem of Today's China"). It was this cultural convergence theory and linear historical view that cleared the ideological obstacles for the spread of Marxism in China.

It can be seen that the patriotic spirit of the May Fourth Movement was anti-imperialist but not blindly xenophobic, patriotic but not isolationist, transcending narrow patriotism and nationalism, and reaching a new height. Of course, it is very easy for people to point out the academic errors in their work, but they were not discussing academics; it is also entirely reasonable to criticize the extremism and one-sidedness of their thoughts, but their intention was precisely to be extreme, to use sharp words to awaken the people, and to use radical criticism to "transform the national character." It is precisely because of this that they were able to shock the deaf and open up a new era in modern Chinese thought history. Today, the times have changed, and the words of indignation that appeared under the historical conditions seventy years ago have become a thing of the past. However, through these words of indignation, the patriotic passion and the painful souls of the May Fourth pioneers, who were worried about the country and the people, and their sincere love for the country, can still be clearly seen.

　　略论“五四”的爱国精神
    雷颐
    爱国主义是五四运动的主要内容和特点之一。五四的爱国精神比前此“变法图存”的维新运动和“扶清灭洋”的义和团运动有更为深远的历史意义和更为复杂的思想内容，但长期以来，对其深层的复杂意识却很少注意。
    当共和徒具虚名、辛亥革命的成果令人失望的时刻，一批具有新知识和历史使命感的知识分子便开始了对失败原因的反思与探索。他们力图透过表面政治现象，在更为广阔的文化背景中探究失败的根源。这样，一场以批判传统文化、弘扬民主、科学来“改造国民性”的新文化运动便由此发轫了。
    但问题的困难在于，他们用以启蒙的武器——民主与科学，恰恰来源于侵略中国、危及中国存亡的西方。于是一个尖锐的矛盾便摆在他们面前：既要反对侵略，奋起救亡，又要用西方的文化来批判自己的本土文化。这样，他们必然要进一步探寻国家是什么，爱国是什么，这个国值不值得爱。陈独秀发人深省地说：“要问我们应当不应当爱国，先要问国家是什么。原来国家不过是人民集合对外抵抗别人压迫的组织，对内调和人民纷争的机关”（陈独秀：《我们究竟应当不应当爱国？》）。高一涵则在《新青年》上连续撰文，探讨国家的起源与本质，介绍西方的各种国家学说。他们热情宣扬以西方的契约论为基础的国家观，即认为国家是人民意志协约的产物，尽管这种把国家作为一种精神意志产物的观点并不正确，但毕竟破除了“皇权神授”、“朕即国家”的神秘观念，实际上批判了“国家神圣”的国家崇拜论，由此必然得出“国家非人生之归宿”的结论。他们认为，国家并非人生之归宿，它只是求得归宿的途径。人民国家有互相对立之资格，国家对于人民有权利，人民对于国家亦有权利；人民对于国家有义务，国家对于人民亦有义务。这样，他们拒绝了国家高于一切、位居人民之上的观点，明确提出了国家与人民应当相互承担权利和义务。
    在此，新文化运动的先锋们突破了中国传统伦理本位的国家观。在中国传统文化中，“国”与“家”紧密相联，“国”只是“家”的扩大。从“男女有别”生出“夫妇有义”；“夫妇有义而后父子有亲，父子有亲而后君臣有正”。由父慈子孝推衍出君礼臣忠，从家庭伦理关系而逐渐推衍出国家政治原则。这样，个人与国家的关系犹如与家庭的关系一样，是一种无法摆脱的伦理关系。这种伦理本位的国家观无疑与现代商品经济社会格格不入。劳动力成为商品的一个先决条件是劳动者必须没有任何人身依附而能自由出卖。契约论国家观恰恰体现、反映了这种精神。正是根据这种国家观，陈独秀激动地说：“国家者，保障人民之权利、谋益人民之幸福者也。不此之务，其国也存之无所荣，亡之无所惜”（《爱国心与自觉心》）。也就是说，个人与国家之间并没有一种“天生的”必然关系，当国家违背人民意愿时，人民亦有权要求国家必须按人民的利益行事。这样，他们将国家与个人之间的垂直的纵向关系变为一种平面的横向关系。换句话说，国家本身并不是目的，而是“鼓舞群伦，使充其本然之能”，“谋充各得其所”的手段。
    但是，尽管他们得出了若国家不能代表人民的利益，“其国也存之无所荣，亡之无所惜”的理性认识，却无法从感情上割断与生于斯长于斯的国家的联系。这种理性与感情的冲突，造成了他们内心的巨大痛苦。他们力图寻找更为根本的救国之道，“欲图根本之救亡，所需乎国民性质行为之改善”（陈独秀：《我之爱国主义》）。这样，改造“国民性”就成为救亡的迫切任务。于是，救亡与启蒙便某种程度地统一起来。
    面对中国社会现实，陈独秀感叹道：“一国之民，精神上，物质上，如此退化，如此堕落，即人不我伐，亦有何颜面，有何权利，生存于世界？”（《我之爱国主义》）哀其不幸，怒其不争是一种普遍的情绪。鲁迅借“狂人”之口怒指中国传统的“仁义道德”吃人，在一代青年心中激起强烈共鸣。陈独秀甚至激愤地责备中国人“沐浴不勤，臭恶视西人所畜犬马加甚；厨灶不治，远不若欧美厕所之清洁。……然此犹属外观之污秽，而其内心之不洁，尤令人言之恐怖。”（《我之爱国主义》）这样，出路只有一条，即用西方现代文化彻底改造或完全取代中国传统文化。使人颇为惊讶的是，大力宣扬科学精神的陈独秀，在转向马克思主义的１９２０年竟至热情地赞颂西方的基督教，并责备自己的祖国说：“中国社会麻木不仁，不说别的好现象，就是自杀的坏现象都不可多得”，因而“要把耶稣崇高的、伟大的人格，和热烈的、深厚的情感，培养在我们的血里，将我们从堕落在冷酷，黑暗，污浊坑中救起。”他还列举了基督教传入中国后，引起种种冲突的十种原因，说道：“上列十种原因当中，平心而论，实在是中国人底错处多，外国人底错处不过一两样。他们这一两样错处，差不多已经改去了。”（《基督教与中国人》）从这些激烈又极端的言辞中可以看出，他们认为西方文化对中国文化的撞击尽管伴随船坚炮利而来，却具有促进中华民族猛醒的积极意义。但是，在摆脱了一种狭隘的爱国主义和偏激的民族主义之时，黑暗的现实又使他们难免会产生一种民族虚无主义的激愤之情。
    他们之所以完全、彻底否定中国传统文化的更深刻原因，则是在他们的历史观中，东西两种文明是时间性而非空间性的。他们认为“西方文明”是进步发达的，而“东方文明”是保守落后的，至多是人类历史发展的例外。“各国之制度文物，形式虽不必尽同，但不思驱其国于危亡者，其遵循共同原则之精神，渐趋一致，潮流所及，莫之能违。于此而执特别历史国情之说，以冀抗此潮流，是犹有锁国之精神，而无世界之智识。”（陈独秀：《敬告青年》）李大钊亦认为东方文明是“静的”、“保守的”，而西方文明是“动的”、“进步的”（《东西文明根本之异点》）。应该说，东西文明是在彼此基本隔绝的条件下历史地发展起来的两大文明，必然有着极大的差异，因此彼此很难照搬。但并不能由此陷入文化相对主义，得出人类文化、历史发展没有共性、没有共同参照系的结论。当西方列强用火与剑征服东方、把世界纳入自己的体系的时候，就迫使人们把不同的文化比较，用一种共同的标准来衡量孰优孰劣，做出取舍。被誉为五四运动的代表人物陈独秀也决断地认为，“若是决计革新，一切都应该采用西洋的新法子，不必拿什么国粹，什么国情的鬼话来捣乱”（陈独秀：《今日中国之政治问题》）。正是这种文化趋同论和单一直线发展史观，为马克思主义在中国的传播扫清了思想障碍。
    可以看出，“五四”爱国精神反帝却不盲目排外、爱国却不闭关自守，超越了狭隘的爱国主义和民族主义，达到新的高度。当然，人们可以很容易地指出他们学术的谬误，但他们本来就不是在谈学术；也完全有理由批评他们思想的偏激片面，但他们本意就是要偏激，就是要用尖刻的言辞唤醒国人，用激烈的批判来“改造国民性”。也惟其如此，才能震聋发聩，开启了中国现代思想史的新时代。今日时代不同了，在七十年前历史条件下出现的激愤之词已成为过往烟云，但是，透过这些激愤的言辞，五四先锋们忧国忧民的赤子之心、热烈真诚的爱国激情及在理性与感情冲突中的痛苦灵魂，依然清晰可见。
