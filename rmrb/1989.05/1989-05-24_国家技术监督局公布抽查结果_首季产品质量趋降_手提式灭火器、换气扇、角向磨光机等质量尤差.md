The State Bureau of Technical Supervision has released the results of its inspections. Product quality in the first quarter has shown a declining trend compared to last year.

According to information from the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, 850 enterprises producing 1,125 types of products were inspected in the first quarter of this year. The inspection results indicate that product quality in the first quarter has declined compared to last year.

All the products inspected are sold domestically, covering 47 categories. The sampling pass rate for eight products, including coal mining machines, coal dewatering screen panels, additives, vanadium catalysts, polyethylene blown film for agricultural use, gas chromatographs, and Pan Sheng Ding, was 100%. Additionally, 17 categories of products had a pass rate between 80% and 99%, 11 categories between 60% and 79%, and 11 categories had a pass rate below 60%.

Of particular concern is that some safety-related products and popular market products, such as portable fire extinguishers, mining explosion-proof vacuum starters, angle grinders, fish meal, and exhaust fans, had very low pass rates and serious quality issues. The pass rate for portable fire extinguishers was only 47.6%. Out of six Bao'an brand MF4 type dry powder fire extinguishers produced by the Heilongjiang Provincial Fire Equipment Factory, three could not spray. Out of three Congtai brand MF8 type dry powder fire extinguishers produced by the Handan City Mengmo Fire Equipment Factory in Hebei Province, two could not spray, and the remaining one had a fire extinguishing agent residual rate of 52.8%, severely affecting its fire-fighting effectiveness. Out of 30 types of exhaust fans inspected, only 10 were qualified. The product with the worst quality was the angle grinder, with a pass rate of only 26.7%. Among the nine substandard products found, seven were from factories in the Jin Hua area of Zhejiang Province.

Among the inspected enterprises, large enterprises had a sampling pass rate of 88%, medium and small enterprises had a pass rate of 75.5%, and township enterprises had a pass rate of 59.1%.

　　国家技术监督局公布抽查结果
    首季产品质量趋降
    手提式灭火器、换气扇、角向磨光机等质量尤差
    本报北京５月２４日讯  记者朱剑红报道：据来自国家技术监督局的消息，今年一季度，国家监督抽查了８５０个企业生产的１１２５种产品。抽查结果表明，一季度产品的质量与去年相比，呈下降趋势。
    此次抽查的产品全部是在国内销售的，共有４７类。采煤机、煤用脱水筛条筛板、助剂、钒催化剂、聚乙烯吹塑农用地膜、气相色谱仪、安定、潘生丁８类产品的抽样合格率为１００％。此外，有１７类产品合格率为８０％至９９％，１１类为６０％到７９％，还有１１类合格率不到６０％。
    值得警惕的是，本季度抽查的部分安全性产品及市场走俏的产品，如手提式灭火器、矿用隔爆型真空起动器、角向磨光机、鱼粉和换气扇等，合格率很低，质量问题严重。手提式灭火器的合格率仅为４７．６％，黑龙江省消防器材厂的保安牌ＭＦ４型干粉灭火器被抽查６具，有３具不能喷射；河北省邯郸市孟仵消防器材厂的丛台牌ＭＦ８型干粉灭火器有２具不能喷射，另一具灭火剂剩余率为５２．８％，严重影响灭火效果。在抽查的３０种换气扇中，只有１０种合格。产品质量最差的是角向磨光机，合格率仅为２６．７％，查出的９种劣质产品中，有７个厂都在浙江金华地区。
    在被抽查的企业中，大型企业的抽样合格率为８８％，中、小型企业抽样合格率为７５．５％，乡镇企业的抽样合格率为５９．１％。
