Yang Dechang remained silent, his face expressionless, while John, sitting beside him, beamed with joy. He watched the large projection screen showing himself and his family playing at Tiger Hill and visiting the Embroidery Research Institute, occasionally clapping his hands and making sounds of delight, completely forgetting the unpleasantness from a few hours earlier.

Seeing John's sparse gray hair quiver with excitement, Yang Dechang felt a heavy weight in his heart.

He was immersed in the atmosphere of the verbal sparring match...

John was the general manager of Philips Electronics in Malaysia, accompanied by his wife and children on a tour of China, seeking potential cooperation projects and partners. He visited the Suzhou Spring Flower Vacuum Cleaner Factory, where the factory director, Yang Dechang, showed him the product display room. As soon as he entered the small room, John's eyes were drawn to the XW60-A type vacuum cleaner. He rushed forward and hugged it, raising his right hand to have his wife take a photo of him in high spirits. "This is a product of our Philips company. Seeing it in your country makes me very happy!" John gestured, his joy evident. Philips produces 800,000 vacuum cleaners annually, selling them worldwide. Seeing a familiar product in a foreign land naturally brought him great joy.

"No, this is our factory's product," Yang Dechang replied with a apologetic smile. John's face immediately darkened: "It has a patent!"

"However, your country did not apply for this patent in ours."

John closed his mouth. They had overlooked this legal procedure in China.

Yang Dechang also fell silent. His heart ached as if it were being wrung out. After instructing the information department's Lu to take the camera and accompany John's family on their tour, he couldn't shake off this heavy feeling.

John's accusation was not wrong. His factory's new product was indeed a copy of Philips' vacuum cleaner. The fact was cruel: many of China's "home appliance" factories, and even a considerable number of other industrial enterprises, followed the path of "copy, assemble, innovate." Many industrialized countries had gone through this stage before taking off.

Yang Dechang's tall, imposing figure became associated with vacuum cleaners ten years ago at the Shanghai International Consumer Goods Exhibition. The cleaning appliance made of iron and plastic had a much broader prospect than the increasingly unprofitable nail production at his Yangtze River Hardware Factory. They traveled around Shanghai and finally bought an American vacuum cleaner from the 1950s and a Polish vacuum cleaner and polisher from the 1970s at a trust store, beginning the imitation of cleaning appliances. Later, Yang Dechang learned that the vacuum cleaners used in large hotels in China were all imported, and these imported treasures often ended up in storage due to damaged parts and lack of maintenance. He borrowed a canister vacuum cleaner from the Suzhou Hotel, took it apart, and then assembled a vacuum cleaner maintenance service team, quietly striking out in all directions. In less than two years, their footsteps covered major hotels in the south and north of the Yangtze River, restoring the youth of countless vacuum cleaners. These foreign gadgets, except for the shell, had mostly been replaced by Yang Dechang's parts. One day, he carried two of his own vacuum cleaners into the Shanghai Grand Building by the Waitan Bridge and asked the manager to try his "Spring Flower" brand: "Try it, free trial! If it doesn't work, throw it aside. If it's good, keep it. If you're satisfied, pay the factory price. Alright?" He smiled. His canister vacuum cleaner not only sucked up dust as small as yellow and green beans but even a number one battery, and the price was only half that of similar imported machines.

The results of the trial showed that Yang Dechang's words were not false!

Spring had arrived, a good time to plant flowers and trees.

In April 1983, the National Tourism Administration held a tourism product ordering meeting in Wuhan. Yang Dechang managed to secure a seat as a delegate. His "Spring Flower" was placed in a corner. Swedish and Swiss companies in Hong Kong, such as the Weiss Company and the Tjeb Company, as usual, proudly displayed their products in the main positions. These two companies were old-established companies specializing in exports to China and paid no attention to the small flower in the corner. But this time, they made a fatal mistake: they underestimated the wisdom of the Chinese people! It was at this ordering meeting that "Spring Flower" became known to more compatriots. In two years, Yang Dechang spread over 4,000 "Spring Flowers."

In 1987, 163,000 units were produced, accounting for more than half of the national output, and achieving four firsts in the country: first in production, first in sales, first in awards, and first in foreign exchange earnings.

However, unfavorable factors also emerged. Intelligence indicated that by the end of 1988, nearly a hundred vacuum cleaner factories had joined the market competition, with a total output of nearly 2 million units, far exceeding market demand. Looking at the world, there were thousands of vacuum cleaner patents and hundreds of new models each year. The new generation of silent, wireless, remote-sensing, computer-controlled, laser, and intelligent high-end vacuum cleaners emerged one after another like bamboo shoots after a rain, while China's product level was still at the international level of the 1960s. He decided to catch up. But he only knew the domestic situation and was ignorant of the relevant international situation. He selected personnel to go to the Municipal Science and Technology Commission and the Shanghai Science and Technology Information Center to understand the latest global information and formulate an export-oriented production development strategy. He immediately began to establish a computer-managed information database and connect with various levels of science and technology information institutions. The information center collected, stored, and translated over 30,000 patent projects from Japan, the United States, and Europe in 1987 within just one month, edited and printed internal publications such as "Vacuum Cleaner Information Reference," "Vacuum Cleaner Patent Abstracts," "Vacuum Cleaner Performance Evaluation," and "Vacuum Cleaner Design Guide," hired 18 information officers nationwide to provide market production and sales intelligence on vacuum cleaners, and issued special express telegrams every day...

It was this measure that made "Spring Flower" thrive like dew, standing out in the competition and winning battle after battle. In May 1988, when the Sichuan Information Station of the Information Center reported that two vacuum cleaner factories in Shanghai and Shandong planned to hold a large sales exhibition in Chengdu on June 10, Yang Dechang, despite being ill, deployed the "Spring Flower" proliferation route and timeline. By May 25, 5,000 "Spring Flower" home vacuum cleaners had arrived in Chengdu, and by June 1, "Spring Flower" had bloomed in various large stores in the Chengdu Plain. The best internal quality, beautiful appearance, and reasonable price immediately captured the local market. With Chengdu in hand, the door to the southwest would not be closed. The latecomers from Shanghai and Shandong could only sigh in admiration.

Next, Yang Dechang moved south and north with ease. His name cards fluttered onto the desks of more than 50 responsible persons from the three major commercial groups of commerce, trade, and economy. From Hangzhou to Dalian, from Shanghai to Dongguan, "Spring Flower" banners were seen everywhere, attracting bees and butterflies, standing out among the flowers.

A smile flickered across Yang Dechang's lips as he recalled the victorious past. When he turned his gaze back to John's face, a vague thought emerged...

John and his family were finally leaving, holding the video tape given to him. John smiled and waved goodbye to Yang Dechang.

Yang Dechang turned around, quickly climbed the steps, and returned to his office desk. The more than 400 pictures and 1,000 different shapes of vacuum cleaners collected by him and his assistants displayed the colorful new world of contemporary vacuum cleaners, dazzling the eyes. The advanced nature of contemporary industrial products was not only reflected in their functions and structures but also in the colors, textures, luster, patterns, touch, and comfort of their materials. Rapidly improving the competitiveness of one's own products and promoting exports was key to grasping the key—design.

Yang Dechang and the Wuxi Light Industry College jointly established a design institute. Two professors from the Industrial Product Design and Modeling Department of the college served as the heads of the research institute branch, and a design professor from Tokyo University in Japan was hired as a consultant to design "Spring Flower" with international standards every year.

Yang Dechang was once again ahead of his peers. Whether it was one step or two, whoever had a forward-looking mindset could grasp the initiative in competition.

On the morning of September 12, 1988, under clear autumn skies, a simple yet grand signing ceremony began in the newly completed Garden Hotel opposite the famous garden of Suzhou, Liu Yuan. Subsequently, a 100cm by 60cm golden plaque of the "Spring Flower Electrical Appliance Industrial Design Research Institute" was embedded in the wall next to the factory gate, shining brightly in the sunlight.

Yang Dechang smiled. In 1988, the per capita labor productivity exceeded 300,000 yuan, reaching the level of developed countries. He was confident about the future:

Spring flowers have bloomed, and the autumn harvest will be bountiful!

　　春华秋实
    山谷
    杨德昌沉默着，脸上毫无表情，而身旁的约翰却笑逐颜开，看着大型投影屏幕上自己和妻儿游玩虎丘、参观刺绣研究所的模样，不时拍拍手，嘴里发出愉快的声响，一扫几小时前的不快。
    瞅着约翰稀疏的灰发由于兴奋在不住颤动，杨德昌心里格外沉重。
    他沉浸在那场口舌交锋的氛围里……
    约翰是荷兰菲利浦电气公司驻马来西亚的总裁，携妻儿来中国观光、游览，同时寻找有无合作的项目和伙伴。他来到苏州春花吸尘器总厂，厂长杨德昌陪他去看自己的产品陈列室。一跨进那间小小的屋子，约翰一眼就盯住了卧式ＸＷ６０—Ａ型吸尘器，抢步上前抱在怀里，扬起右手，让妻子给他拍了张神采飞扬的照片。“这是我们菲利浦公司的产品，在贵国能见到它，非常高兴！”约翰比划着，得意之情溢于言表。菲利浦公司每年生产８０万台吸尘器，畅销世界各地，异乡见己物，自然喜悦异常。
    “不，这是我们厂的产品。”杨德昌歉然一笑。约翰脸色刷地就变了：“它是有专利权的！”
    “可是贵国并没有在我国申报这项专利。”
    约翰闭上了嘴，他们疏忽了在中国的这项法律手续。
    杨德昌也不作声了。他心里像被揪一般难过，在指派信息科的小吕携着摄像机陪伴约翰一家去游玩后，他一直就没法摆脱这种沉重感。
    约翰的指责并不错，他的工厂的这一新品正是仿造菲利浦公司的。事实是无情的：我国的许多“家电”工厂，甚至相当数量的其他工业企业，都是走着“一仿二组三创”的路子。许多工业国家在起飞前都有过这个阶段。
    高高大大的杨德昌和吸尘器结缘，是在十年前的上海国外消费品展览会上。这铁和塑料组合的清洁器具，较他的长江五金厂越来越不景气的铁钉生产，无疑有着广阔的前景。他们在上海四处奔波，终于在信托商店里买到一台美国５０年代的吸尘器，和一台波兰７０年代的吸尘打蜡机，开始了清洁器具的仿制。后来，杨德昌了解到国内大宾馆使用的全是进口吸尘器，而这些进口宝贝常因部件损坏得不到维修而尘封库房，于是向苏州饭店借了只进口筒式吸尘器，回来拆装、分解，然后组建了一支吸尘器维修服务小分队，悄悄地四处出击。不出两年，他们的足迹遍布大江南北各大宾馆，让无数的吸尘器恢复了青春。这些洋玩意儿，除外壳，内囊却多半是杨德昌们的物件了。有一天，他背着两只自产的吸尘器走进外白渡桥畔的上海大厦，请经理用用他的“春花”牌：“试用，免费试用！不行就甩一边，合用就留着。如果满意，再付出厂价，阿好？”他面带微笑。他的筒式吸尘器不但能吸黄豆、绿豆那样大的尘埃，连一号电池也能吸进去，价格却只有同类进口机器的一半。
    使用结果表明，杨德昌的话毫不虚妄！
    春天到了，是莳花树木的好时候。
    １９８３年４月，国家旅游局在武汉召开旅游产品定货会。杨德昌千方百计争取到列席代表的资格。他的“春花”置放一角。瑞典、瑞士在香港的威氏公司、特洁公司，像往常一样，在主导位置上傲然摊开了他们的产品。这两个公司是专营对我国出口的老牌公司，他们对仿佛瑟缩一角的小花未置一顾。但此次，他们犯了个致命的错误：过低地估量了中国人的智慧！正是在这次定货会上，“春花”让更多的同胞们了解了。两年功夫，杨德昌洒播了四千多朵“春花”。
    １９８７年共生产了１６．３万台，占全国产量的一半以上，并获得全国四个第一：产量第一、销量第一、获奖第一、创汇第一。
    然而不利的因素也相辅相生。情报表明，到１９８８年底有近百家吸尘器厂相继上马参加市场竞争，总产量近２００万台，大大超出市场需求；放眼世界，吸尘器专利每年就有上千项，新品几百种，新一代的无声、无电、无线、传感、遥感、电脑、激光、智能等高档吸尘器，雨后春笋般陆续问世，而我国的产品水平还处在国际６０年代初的水平。他决意赶上去。但他只熟知国内行情，对国外的有关情况却茫无所知，便选有关人员赶赴市科委和上海科技情报处，了解世界最新信息，制定外向型生产发展战略。并迅即着手建立一个由计算机管理的信息资料库，和各级科技情况机构挂钩。信息中心只花了１个月的时间就收集、贮存、翻译了１９８７年日本、美国、欧洲的３万多个专利项目，编辑打印了“吸尘器信息参考”“吸尘器专利文摘”和“吸尘器性能评价”“吸尘器设计导报”等内刊资料，在全国各地聘用了１８个信息员，提供吸尘器市场生产、销售情报，每天印发特快电讯……
    正是这一措施，使“春花”如淋甘露，在竞争中高出一筹，连战连捷。１９８８年５月，当信息中心四川信息站传来上海、山东两家吸尘器厂预定于６月１０日在成都举办销售大联展的消息时，杨德昌便带病部署“春花”繁衍的路线和时间。５月２５日前５０００台春花“家吸”运抵成都，６月１日“春花”便已怒放在成都平原的各大商店。最好的内在质量，艳丽的外观和合理的价格，立刻占领了当地市场。成都在握，通往西南的大门便不愁不开了。晚来一步的上海、山东两家只得望洋兴叹。
    接着，杨德昌潇洒地移师南北。他的名片纷纷飞落在全国５０多家新、贸、经三大商业集团负责人的桌面上。从杭州到大连，从上海到东莞，到处可见春花艳帜高悬，招“蜂”引“蝶”，卓立群芳。
    一抹笑意掠过杨德昌的嘴角，回顾胜利的往事常常令人情不自禁。当他再次把目光投向约翰的面庞时，一个朦胧的念头萌发了……
    约翰一家终于要走了，拿着赠送给他的录相带，约翰笑吟吟地挥手和杨德昌告别。
    杨德昌转过身，急速地迈上台阶，回到自己的办公桌前。他和他的助手们所搜集到的４００多幅、１０００多个形态的吸尘器图片，展示了当今吸尘器五彩缤纷的新世界，令人目眩神迷。当代工业产品的先进性，不仅体现在它的功能与结构上，也体现在材料的色彩、重感、光泽、纹理、触感和舒适感等方面。迅速提高自己产品的竞争能力，推动出口，关键是能否把握住钥匙——设计。
    杨德昌与无锡轻工学院共同研究成立设计院，学院工业品设计造型系的两位教授做研究所分所的负责人，聘日本东京大学造型系设计教授做顾问，每年将设计出具有国际水平的“春花”。
    杨德昌又一次跑在同行的前头了。哪怕是一步两步，谁有超前意识谁就能掌握竞争的主动权。
    １９８８年９月１２日上午，秋高气爽，苏州著名园林留园对面新落成的园外楼饭店里，一个简单而又隆重的签字仪式开始了。随后，一块长１００厘米、宽６０厘米的金光闪闪的“春花电器工业设计研究所”的大铜牌，镶嵌进了工厂大门旁的墙壁上，阳光下格外辉煌、醒目。
    杨德昌笑了，１９８８年人均劳动生产率超过３０万元，达到发达国家的水平，对未来，他很自信：
    春花开了，秋实将是丰硕的！
