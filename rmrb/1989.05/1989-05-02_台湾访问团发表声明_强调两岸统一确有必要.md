A delegation from Taiwan, led by "Legislative Yuan" member Fei Xiping, issued a statement before departing Beijing for visits to other parts of the country. The statement emphasized the necessity of unification across the Taiwan Strait, asserting that the Chinese nation should reunite to contribute to world peace.

The statement said that after eight days of interactions with various sectors, the delegation deeply felt that communication and understanding between the two sides are insufficient and require further effort. "Intellectuals on both sides should urge their respective authorities to genuinely set aside past grievances, seek common ground while reserving differences, and with a spirit of inclusiveness, find a peaceful unification solution that is acceptable to both sides and serves the highest interests of the Chinese nation through negotiations."

The statement expressed the hope that in the future, more delegations will visit each other, further strengthen mutual understanding, and promote democratic and peaceful unification across the Taiwan Strait.

　　台湾访问团发表声明    
    强调两岸统一确有必要
    新华社北京５月２日电  以台湾“立法委员”费希平为团长的“中国民主和平统一访问团”，今天离京去外地访问前发表声明指出，海峡两岸确有统一之必要，中华民族应该再团结起来，为世界和平贡献一份力量。
    声明说，经过这八天与各界接触，我们深深感到两岸的沟通与了解不够，仍需再加努力。“两岸知识分子应敦促当局，切实放弃前嫌，求同存异，以包容的雅量，在两岸均能接受的基础上，以谈判方式寻求符合中华民族最高利益的和平统一方案。”
    声明表示，期望以后有更多的访问团，经过互相访问，进一步加强两岸的了解，以促进两岸达到民主和平统一。
