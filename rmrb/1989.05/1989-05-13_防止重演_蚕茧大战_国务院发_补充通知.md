Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th.

Today, reporters from the China Silk Import and Export Corporation learned that to prevent the "Silkworm Cocoon War" from recurring, the State Council recently issued a "Supplementary Notice" on strengthening the management of cocoon, silk, and silk fabric operations.

The notice requires that all localities and departments must strengthen their responsibility systems. No new production capacities are allowed to be added in any region. For large and medium-sized export production enterprises with good quality and high efficiency, the local silk import and export companies must prioritize the supply of raw materials. For silk mills that consume a lot of resources and produce poor-quality products, they must be closed, stopped, merged, or transformed within a specified period. For those who violate the "Emergency Notice" and engage in illegal operations of cocoons, silk, and silk fabrics, their goods or funds will be confiscated, and fines will be imposed. Cross-regional purchases are strictly prohibited. For raw materials such as silk yarn and silk fabric needed by foreign-funded enterprises, the supply will be guaranteed according to the plan, and the price will be negotiated by both parties, settled in foreign currency. For foreign-funded enterprises exporting grey fabric, export permits will be issued according to the contract.
