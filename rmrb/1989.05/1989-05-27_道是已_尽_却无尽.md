In the city of Nanchang, with nearly a million residents, 400 tons of domestic waste and debris are produced daily. The scenic spot of "Baihua Zhou" in the city center's Donghu Lake, which has several dozen acres of water, has become a natural cesspool and garbage bin for nearby residents to dump feces and garbage.

In Shanghai, 250 tons of solid waste are casually dumped into the Huangpu River every day, along with countless tons of waste and garbage from over 7,000 large and small ships.

Experts estimate that China suffers an economic loss of 7.9 billion yuan annually due to a large amount of solid waste, and water pollution causes an economic loss of approximately 37.7 billion yuan. These two losses account for 11.79% of the national income in 1982.

The problem of how to handle these wastes has become a headache.

In Hezhou Township, Fengcheng City, Jiangxi Province, there is a village called Wei Li with 292 households and over 1,000 people. The village has only about 700 acres of farmland, no mountains or forests, and no mineral resources. Previously, the village was poor, with half the year having only two meals a day. However, in 1983, a villager named Xu Yiyun took his family to collect and buy old clothes, plastic sheets, and similar items. After sorting, cleaning, and organizing them, he sold them to others, earning 8,000 yuan that year. Adding income from raising pigs and growing vegetables, he became the first millionaire in the village, known as the "King of Scrap Collectors." Now, every household in the village, except for the five-guarantee households, has become a "scrap king," with each household earning over 10,000 yuan in taxes. Over the years, the village has built new houses through scrap collection, and Xu Yiyun's family earned over 100,000 yuan last year.

Fengcheng City has a population of 1.05 million, with 90% being rural residents. Some villages have less land and more people, so they specialize in collecting and purchasing waste materials. Last year, the city collected 32,000 tons of waste materials, realizing a tax revenue of 3.51 million yuan. Now, Fengcheng City has become one of the national waste material distribution centers. The national waste material procurement meeting was held here at the end of last year, with a transaction volume of 40 million yuan.

With a large amount of waste materials, in addition to continuously supplying state-owned enterprises and township enterprises with raw materials, Fengcheng City itself also classifies and further processes them. There are now 72 waste material utilization enterprises, with 6 series of products: one is the plastic processing series. After collecting and processing waste plastics, products such as packaging straps, woven bags, chamber pots, and washing boards are made, totaling 12 products. Two is the metal processing series. Large waste metal items are cut into small pieces to produce medium and small agricultural tools; waste aluminum is melted and drawn into wires to make various types of high-pressure aluminum wires; waste iron is processed into iron pots, etc. Three is the waste paper processing series. Collected cement packaging paper, newspapers, etc., are processed into corrugated paper, packaging boxes, etc. Four is the series of various types of bones. Five is the series of goose and duck feathers processed into down products. Six is the series of various types of old clothes processed into machine-wiping cloths, mops, etc. Last year, this deep processing realized a production value of over 10 million yuan.

Utilizing waste materials, there are countless paths, the key is to have the heart. In Guiyang City, someone compressed garbage and waste into bricks, saving farmland. Farmers in Huangxi Township, Yujian County, Jiangxi Province, set up stalls by the roadside to collect waste, earning nearly 3 million yuan in waste annually, enriching half the township. In Huarong County, Hunan Province, over 500 waste processing specialists emerged, turning waste into organic fertilizer for sale, making what was once despised into a sought-after item for farmers. Nanchang City has 1,160 garbage bins, and every morning, people come to pick through them. Those who pick through the garbage bins earn an average of 300 yuan a month, with the least earning five or six yuan a day.

China is still not rich, and seriously handling waste materials to live in a clean environment requires the cooperation and awareness of everyone. At the same time, turning waste into treasure and transforming decay into miracles, the path seems "exhausted" yet endless, there is much to be done, it all depends on your management strategy.

　　道是已“尽”却无尽
    本报记者  赵相如
    近百万城市人口的南昌：每天产生４００吨生活垃圾和废料，市中心东湖的“百花洲”是一个有几十亩湖面的风景点，却成了附近居民倾倒粪便，垃圾的天然贮粪池和垃圾桶；
    上海：黄浦江每天被人们毫不在乎地倾入固体垃圾达２５０吨，还有７０００多艘大小船舶倒进江里的无法计算的废料和垃圾。
    据专家用定量法估算，我国每年因为大量的固定废弃物而造成的经济损失是７９亿元，水污染所造成的经济损失约３７７亿元，这两项损失相当于１９８２年国民收入总额的１１．７９％。
    如何处理这些废料已经成为令人头痛的问题。
    江西丰城市河洲乡围里村，２９２户人家，１０００多口人，只有７００来亩田地，没有山林，没有矿产，以前穷，一年有半年每天只能吃两顿。但是，１９８３年村里有个徐义云带了一家人到处去收购破布、废塑布之类，回来分拣、洗净、整理再卖给人家，当年获利８０００元，加上养猪、种菜等收入，成了这个村里第一个万元户，人称“收破烂大王”。现在全村除了五保户外，户户都成了“破烂王”，户户利税超万元。这几年下来，这个村户户都靠收破烂盖起了一幢幢新楼，徐义云一家去年收入超过１０万元。
    丰城市有１０５万人口，９０％是农村人口，有的村田少人多，于是专门干收购废旧物资的行当，去年全市收购的废旧物资３．２万吨，实现税利３５１万元。现在丰城市成了全国废旧物资集散中心之一，去年底全国废旧物资订货会在这里召开，成交额竟达４０００万元。
    有了大量的废旧物资，除了源源不断供应国营企业、乡镇企业作原料外，丰城市自己还进行分类再加工，出现了７２家废旧物资利用企业，有６个一条龙系列产品：一是塑料加工一条龙。将废旧塑料收购后加工成产品，如打包带、编织袋、尿桶、洗衣板等有１２个产品。二是废金属加工一条龙。将废旧金属的大件割小件，生产中小农具；将废旧铝熔化后拉成丝，做成各种型号的高压铝线；将废铁加工做铁锅等。三是废旧纸加工一条龙。将收购来的水泥包装纸、书报纸等加工成瓦楞纸、包装箱等。四是各种杂骨加工一条龙。五是鹅鸭毛加工成羽绒制品。六是将各种破布加工成擦机布、拖把等。去年这种深加工实现产值１０００多万元。
    利用废料，路有千万条，关键在于有心。贵阳市有人把垃圾废料压缩制成了砖，可以省去农田的损耗。江西余江县潢溪乡的农民在公路边设摊收购，每年收进近３００万元破烂，靠这一着富了半个乡。湖南省华容县涌现了５００多个垃圾加工专业户，他们把垃圾做成有机肥料出售，使过去令人讨厌的东西成了农民的抢手货。南昌市有１１６０只垃圾箱，每天清早就有人来翻捡，拣翻垃圾箱的人，一个月平均收入多的３００来元，最差一天也有五六元钱。
    我国还不富裕，认真处理废料，使人们生活在一个洁净的环境里，需要每个人的合作与自觉；同时变废为宝，化腐朽为神奇，道是已“尽”却无尽，这里面的文章很多，就看你的经营谋略了。
