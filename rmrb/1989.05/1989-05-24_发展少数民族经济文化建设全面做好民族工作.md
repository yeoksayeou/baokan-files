The main task of China's ethnic work in the current stage is to develop economic and cultural construction. Since the founding of the People's Republic, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, ethnic regions have made tremendous achievements in economic and cultural construction. However, overall, the level of social, economic, and cultural development in ethnic regions is still relatively backward. The commodity economy is underdeveloped, labor productivity is low, and economic benefits are poor. Education, science and technology, healthcare, and other sectors lag far behind the needs of the developing situation. Illiteracy remains high. The contradiction between the backwardness of production and the growing material and cultural needs of the people remains the principal contradiction in society. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on economic construction, concentrate efforts on developing productive forces, develop socialist commodity economy, accelerate the process of commercialization, socialization, and modernization of production, so that the economy can develop rapidly. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously develop the scientific, educational, and cultural undertakings of ethnic minorities and ethnic regions, providing scientific and intellectual support for economic construction, so that both economic and cultural construction can be developed.

To achieve relatively rapid development in economic and cultural construction, it is necessary to seriously implement the general policy of reform and opening up in all areas of ethnic work. In the current era, every ethnic group in China must take the path of reform and opening up to achieve economic prosperity, cultural development, and the happiness and progress of the people. The State Council requires the State Ethnic Affairs Commission to "investigate and study the special situations and problems in the reform of the system in ethnic regions, and participate in the formulation of relevant special policies and measures." Ethnic work departments at all levels in ethnic regions must grasp the task of reform and opening up as an important task. At present, ethnic regions should seriously implement the guiding principles of rectification and deepening reform, and on the basis of summarizing the experience of ten years of reform, conduct a comprehensive and systematic investigation and research on the system reform in ethnic regions, propose a general approach, and according to the actual situation, grasp the key issues, study them one by one, formulate corresponding policies, measures, and implement them step by step. All measures that are conducive to reform and opening up and promote the development of productive forces can be experimented with; all good and effective measures should be implemented as soon as possible. It is necessary to handle the relationship between the overall situation and local conditions, the relationship between some people getting rich first and the common prosperity of all ethnic groups, the relationship between supporting the coastal economic development strategy and the complementary and common development of the eastern, central, and western regions; it is necessary to strengthen the propaganda and education of reform, and improve the understanding and adaptability of cadres and the masses of all ethnic groups to reform.

Over the past ten years, although the education cause in ethnic regions has achieved great success, it is still relatively backward, directly affecting economic development. We must take the development of ethnic education and the cultivation of talents as a strategic focus for ethnic regions to get rid of poverty and become prosperous, and build socialist modernization. Special measures should be taken to provide strong support and assistance to ethnic regions in terms of manpower, material resources, and financial resources to accelerate the development of the education cause in ethnic regions. In the current stage, it is necessary to focus on improving basic education and developing secondary and tertiary vocational and technical education, cultivating the urgently needed secondary and tertiary technical talents in the local area, and at the same time, develop higher education in a planned way to cultivate intermediate and senior professional talents.

To develop the economic and cultural undertakings of ethnic minorities, it is necessary to have corresponding laws and systems to safeguard and promote economic and cultural development through legal means. The current focus in ethnic regions should be on the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. In recent years, both the central and local governments have done a lot of work to implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. Some ministries and commissions of the State Council have formulated regulations and measures for the implementation of the autonomy law, and some provinces have promulgated several regulations for the implementation of the autonomy law. Several dozen autonomous regions have formally promulgated autonomy regulations or single regulations. However, due to the ideological problems of some cadres and the failure of the system reform to keep up, some of the autonomous rights stipulated in the autonomy law have not been well implemented in the previous period. Now, it is necessary to further unify understanding and seriously and comprehensively implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy. Currently, an important issue in the implementation of the autonomy law is that the higher-level state organs should fully respect the autonomy of the autonomous regions. The ministries and commissions of the state organs should formulate specific methods and regulations for the implementation of the autonomy law in combination with their own work to ensure that each autonomous region fully enjoys the autonomy. In the development and utilization of resources in ethnic regions, it is necessary to pay attention to protecting the legitimate rights and interests of ethnic regions, so that the economic and cultural construction of ethnic regions and the material and cultural living standards of ethnic groups can be developed and improved accordingly with the development and utilization of local resources. At the same time, it is necessary to vigorously cultivate and use ethnic minority cadres. In the political system reform, the use of ethnic minority cadres should be specially studied. It is necessary to gradually achieve a situation where the number of ethnic minority cadres is roughly proportional to their population. Those who have already exceeded the population ratio in the past should not be reduced. The number of elected cadres and representatives can consider adopting the method of differential elections by ethnic groups to ensure the legal quota of cadres and representatives of all ethnic groups. In units implementing the term target responsibility system and enterprises implementing the contract responsibility system, it is necessary to take the cultivation and improvement of ethnic minority workers as an important content. Ethnic minority cadres bear the great historical responsibility of maintaining national unity, safeguarding national unity, and revitalizing the Chinese nation. They should be self-confident, self-reliant, and self-improving, and strive to temper and improve themselves in a competitive environment. Han cadres and ethnic minority cadres should trust each other, learn from each other, unite and cooperate with each other, and make new contributions to the implementation of the autonomy law, the construction of autonomous regions, and the cause of national unity and progress.

To develop the economic and cultural construction of ethnic minorities, it is necessary to adhere to ethnic equality and strengthen ethnic unity. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's socialist ethnic relations of equality, unity, and mutual assistance have been increasingly consolidated and developed. However, we must also be soberly aware that in the primary stage of socialism, there are still contradictions between different interest groups within the people, and with the further deepening of reform and opening up, new situations and new problems have also emerged among ethnic groups. Although the overall situation of ethnic unity is good, there are still some factors that are not conducive to ethnic unity, social stability, and national unity. In the primary stage of socialism, one of the fundamental tasks of ethnic work is to constantly consolidate socialist ethnic relations and achieve the common development and prosperity of all ethnic groups. To develop socialist ethnic relations, it is necessary to combine the advanced technology of Han regions with the rich resources of ethnic regions, combine the development and utilization of national resources with the interests of local ethnic groups, correctly handle the relationship between higher-level state organs and autonomous regions; handle the relationship between the central government and the enterprises and institutions of various provinces, autonomous regions (including state-owned farms and forestry farms, etc.) and local ethnic minorities; handle the relationship between helping and supporting ethnic minorities in the process of developing commodity competition and eliminating the unfit; handle the relationship between various interest distribution within and among ethnic groups. When the state develops and operates metallurgy, mining, hydropower, timber, and other industries in ethnic regions, it should give reasonable preferential treatment to the local area to enhance the vitality of ethnic regions for self-development. In the process of deepening reform, the relevant departments of state organs should fully pay attention to the special nature of ethnic minorities and ethnic regions, and help ethnic regions to create and improve a truly new system that can promote the development of productive forces in ethnic regions and is full of vitality. With the deepening of reform, the value law and market mechanism will inevitably play an increasingly important role. While emphasizing efficiency and encouraging competition, it is also necessary to provide necessary support and protection to ethnic minorities and ethnic regions. The state's preferential policies for ethnic regions should be gradually improved and developed according to the new situation in the reform. It is necessary to combine economic development with ethnic unity. In this way, with economic construction as the center, adjusting and improving ethnic relations can guarantee and promote the comprehensive development of politics, economy, and culture in ethnic minorities and ethnic regions.

The contradictions in China's ethnic relations generally belong to the contradictions among the people and should be correctly resolved in accordance with the principles of consultation, dialogue, and legal procedures, so that the contradictions can be alleviated and eliminated. First of all, it is necessary to take ethnic equality and unity as the fundamental guiding ideology, adhere to the view that the relationship between ethnic groups is basically the relationship between the working people, and solve the problems that arise in ethnic relations through the correct methods of criticism and self-criticism, consultation and dialogue, and guidance. At the same time, it is necessary to seriously implement the Party's ethnic policies and national laws, overcome the influence of the "left," adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts, and properly handle and solve problems according to the nature of things. For literary works and social science works involving ethnic minorities, it is necessary to combine the implementation of the Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought policy with the promotion of ethnic unity; when there are different opinions, they should be correctly resolved through consultation, mutual understanding, mutual accommodation, criticism, and self-criticism.

In addition, in recent years, a small number of separatist elements have carried out activities to split the unity of the country and sabotage ethnic unity in ethnic regions, using the banner of ethnicity and religion, but this does not belong to ethnic and religious issues, but to issues that violate national laws; in nature, they belong to antagonistic contradictions. All acts of splitting national unity and sabotaging ethnic unity should be punished according to law. The people of all ethnic groups in China are resolutely safeguarding national unity and ethnic unity and will not allow any acts of splitting the country. All attempts to split our great motherland will inevitably end in failure.

　　发展少数民族经济文化建设全面做好民族工作
    司马义·艾买提
    现阶段我国民族工作的主要任务，是发展经济文化建设。建国以来，尤其是党的十一届三中全会以来。民族地区的经济文化建设取得了巨大的成绩，但总的来说，民族地区社会经济文化的发展水平仍然相当落后，商品经济很不发达，劳动生产率低，经济效益差；教育、科学技术、卫生等事业远远跟不上形势发展的需要，文盲仍占很大比例。生产的落后同人民日益增长的物质文化要求的矛盾，仍然是社会的主要矛盾。因此，必须以经济建设为中心，集中力量发展社会生产力，发展社会主义商品经济，加速生产的商品化、社会化、现代化进程，使经济能有一个较快的发展，同时大力发展少数民族和民族地区的科学、教育、文化事业，为经济建设提供科学支持和智力支持，使经济建设和文化建设都得到发展。
    要使经济文化建设得到较快的发展，必须认真把改革开放的总方针总政策贯彻到民族工作的各个领域中去。当今时代，我国每一个民族都必须走改革开放之路，才能求得经济的繁荣、文化的发展、人民的幸福、民族的进步。国务院要求国家民委“调查研究少数民族地区体制改革工作中的特殊情况和问题，参与制定有关的特殊政策和措施。”民族地区各级领导部门和各级民族工作部门要把改革开放工作作为一项重要任务来抓好。当前，民族地区要认真贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的指导方针，要在认真总结十年改革经验的基础上，对民族地区的体制改革进行全面、系统地调查研究，提出总的思路，并根据实际情况，抓住重要问题，一个一个地加以研究，制定相应的方针、政策和措施，把改革开放稳步地推向深入。凡是有利于改革开放、促进生产力发展的，都可以进行试验；凡是好的、行之有效的办法，都要尽快实施。要处理好全局与局部、一部分人先富起来同各族人民共同富裕、支持沿海经济发展战略同东中西部互补互济共同发展之间的关系；要加强改革的宣传教育，提高各族干部群众对改革的认识和承受能力。
    十年来，民族地区的教育事业虽然取得了很大的成就，但是仍然相当落后，直接影响到经济的发展。我们必须把发展民族教育事业，培养人才作为民族地区治穷致富，建设社会主义现代化的战略重点来抓，要采取特殊措施，在人力、物力、财力等方面给少数民族地区大力支持和帮助，加速发展民族地区的教育事业。现阶段，要重点办好基础教育和发展初、中级职业技术教育，培养当地急需的初、中级技术人才，同时有计划地发展高等教育，培养中、高级专业人才。
    发展少数民族的经济文化事业，必须有相应的法律和制度，用法制来保障和促进经济文化的发展。民族地区当前主要应抓好民族区域自治法的贯彻落实。近几年来，为贯彻落实民族区域自治法，中央和地方都作了不少工作。国务院有些部委制定了实施自治法的规定和措施，有些省还颁布了实施自治法的若干规定，全国有几十个自治地方正式颁布了自治条例或单行条例。但是，由于有些干部思想上的原因以及体制改革没能及时跟上，因而前一时期自治法规定的某些自治权利没有得到很好的贯彻落实。现在要进一步统一认识，认真地全面地贯彻落实民族区域自治法。当前，贯彻落实自治法的一个重要问题是，上级国家机关要充分尊重民族自治地方的自治权。国家机关各部、委要结合自己的工作制定贯彻自治法的具体办法和细则，保证各个民族自治地方充分享有的自治权。对民族地区资源的开发和利用，要重视保护少数民族地区的合法权益，要使少数民族地区的经济文化建设和少数民族群众的物质文化生活水平，随着当地资源的开发利用而得到相应的发展和提高。同时，要大力培养和使用少数民族干部。在政治体制改革时，对少数民族干部的任用应进行专门的研究。要逐步做到，少数民族干部的数量与其人口比例大体相当。过去已经大于人口比例的，也不要降下来。选举产生的干部和代表，可以考虑采用按民族进行差额选举的办法，以保证各民族干部和代表的法定名额。在实行任期目标责任制的单位和承包制的企业，要把培养提高少数民族职工作为一项重要内容。少数民族干部肩负着维护民族团结、巩固祖国统一、振兴中华民族的重大历史责任，要自信、自立、自强，努力奋斗，敢于在竞争的环境里去锻炼提高。汉族干部和少数民族干部要相互信任，相互学习，团结合作，共同为自治法的实施、民族自治地方的建设和民族团结进步事业做出新贡献。
    要发展少数民族的经济文化建设，必须坚持民族平等，加强民族团结。十一届三中全会以来，我国平等、团结、互助的社会主义民族关系日益巩固和发展，但是，我们也要清醒地认识到，在社会主义初级阶段，人民内部仍然存在着不同利益群体之间的矛盾，随着改革开放的进一步深化，民族之间也产生了一些新的情况和新的问题。现在，民族团结总的形势虽然很好，但也存在着一些不利于民族团结、社会安定、祖国统一的因素。在社会主义初级阶段，民族工作的根本任务之一，就是要不断巩固社会主义民族关系，实现各民族共同发展和共同繁荣。发展社会主义民族关系，要注意把汉族地区的先进技术与少数民族地区的丰富资源结合起来，把国家对民族地区资源的开发利用与当地民族的利益结合起来，正确处理好上级国家机关与民族自治地方之间的关系；处理好中央和各省、自治区企事业单位（包括国营农、林场等）与当地少数民族的关系；处理好在开展商品竞争中优胜劣汰和帮助、扶持少数民族的关系；处理好民族之间、民族内部的各种利益分配关系。国家在民族地区开发和经营冶金、矿山、水电、木材等各业时，都应给当地以合理优惠的利益，才能增强民族地区自我发展的活力。在深化改革的过程中，国家机关有关部门要充分注意少数民族和民族地区的特殊性，要帮助民族地区创造和完善真正能促进民族地区生产力发展的、充满生机的新体制。随着改革的深化，价值规律和市场机制必然发挥越来越大的作用。在强调效益、鼓励竞争的同时也要对少数民族和民族地区给予必要的扶持和保护。国家对少数民族地区的优惠政策，应根据新的情况，在改革中逐步完善和发展。把经济开发与民族团结结合起来。这样，以经济建设为中心，调节和改善民族关系，才能保障和推动少数民族和民族地区政治、经济、文化的全面发展。
    我国民族关系中的矛盾一般地说来，属于人民内部矛盾，要以协商对话、依法办事的原则正确地加以解决，使矛盾得到缓解和消除。首先，要以各民族平等团结作为根本指导思想，坚持各民族之间的关系基本上是劳动人民之间关系的观点，按照解决人民内部矛盾的途径，通过正确的批评与自我批评、协商对话和疏导的方法，解决民族关系中出现的问题。同时，要认真执行党的民族政策和国家的法律，克服“左”的影响。坚持实事求是的原则，按照事情本来的性质去妥善处理和解决。涉及少数民族的文学创作和社会科学著作，要把贯彻双百方针和有利民族团结紧密结合起来。互相促进；发生不同意见时，要通过协商对话、互谅互让、批评与自我批评正确地加以解决。
    此外，近年来在民族地区发生了极少数分裂主义分子进行分裂祖国统一、破坏民族团结的活动，他们打着民族、宗教的旗号，但这并不属于民族、宗教问题，而是违反国家法律的问题；从性质上讲，属于敌我矛盾。凡属分裂祖国统一、破坏民族团结的行为，都应当按照法律加以惩处。我国各族人民是坚决维护祖国统一和民族团结的，他们绝不允许任何分裂祖国的行为，一切企图分裂我们伟大祖国的破坏活动必然以失败而告终。
