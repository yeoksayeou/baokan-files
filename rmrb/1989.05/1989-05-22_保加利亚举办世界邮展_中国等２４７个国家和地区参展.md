Bulgaria Hosts World Stamp Exhibition with China and 246 Other Countries and Regions Participating

	The world philatelic exhibition named "Bulgaria—1989" opened this morning at the People's Cultural Palace in the center of Sofia. The exhibition features 600,000 sets of stamps and philatelic materials from different periods, provided by 247 countries and regions.

	The China Philatelic Corporation also provided five albums of stamps for display.

	Slavkov, chairman of the Bulgarian Philatelic Association, said at the opening ceremony of the stamp exhibition today that this exhibition is the largest in scale and the most abundant in exhibits among all previous world philatelic exhibitions.

	Philatelists entering the exhibition hall, which is set up in the corridors of the People's Cultural Palace in Sofia, would need approximately seven days and seven nights to view each stamp for just one second. The total length of the corridors is 5 kilometers.

	Many world philatelic treasures are on display at this exhibition. Among them is the unique British stamp, reportedly valued at $500,000. This exhibition also features stamps from nearly 100 historical states such as Prussia, Baden, and the Ottoman Empire, which no longer exist on today's world map.

	This Sofia World Stamp Exhibition will last for 10 days. During the exhibition period, there will also be parachute performances, balloon sightseeing, and model aircraft performances.

    中国等２４７个国家和地区参展
    新华社索非亚５月２２日电  （记者王金柏）命名为“保加利亚——１９８９”的世界集邮展览，今天上午在索非亚市中心的人民文化宫开幕。２４７个国家和地区提供的６０万套各个不同时期的邮票和集邮材料参加了展览。
    中国集邮公司也提供了５本邮票集参加展出。
    保加利亚集邮协会主席斯拉夫科夫在今天的邮展开幕式上说，这次邮展是历次世界集邮展览规模最大、展品最多的一次展览。
    集邮爱好者走进布置在索非亚人民文化宫内陈列展品的回廊曲道，即使对每张邮票光顾１秒钟，也要约７天７夜。所经过的曲道回廊总长度达５公里。
    许多世界集邮珍品参加了这次展览。其中有世界独一无二的英国邮票，据说价值５０万美元。这次还展出了普鲁士、巴顿、奥托马王国等近１００个在历史上存在过、但在当今世界地图上早已消失的国家的邮票珍品。
