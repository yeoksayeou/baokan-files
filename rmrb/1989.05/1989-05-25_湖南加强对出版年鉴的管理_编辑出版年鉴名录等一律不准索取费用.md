Hunan Strengthens Management of Yearbooks

The Hunan Provincial People's Government recently issued regulations to strengthen the management of the editing and publishing of "yearbooks," "directories," and similar materials.

Recently, some departments, units, or individuals in Hunan Province have been independently editing and publishing "yearbooks," "overviews," "directories," and other publications. They demand that relevant units provide materials and collect editing and publishing fees, publishing the materials as long as the fees are paid. This practice has had negative impacts and consequences in society. To address this, the Hunan Provincial Government has issued the following regulations:

1. All "yearbooks," "overviews," "directories," and similar publications must be published by official publishing houses. Magazine offices, newspaper offices, and other non-publishing units are strictly prohibited from organizing the publication of such materials. Violations will be treated as illegal publishing.

2. The editing and publishing of these types of publications must not, under any circumstances, collect any fees from contributing units.

3. After the issuance of this notice, all local governments and departments must immediately conduct an inspection. Any violations of this notice must be promptly corrected, and appropriate follow-up work must be done.

　　湖南加强对出版年鉴的管理
    编辑出版年鉴名录等一律不准索取费用
    本报长沙５月２５日电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省人民政府最近作出规定，加强对编辑出版“年鉴”、“名录”等物的管理。
    近来，湖南省的一些部门、单位或个人，自行编辑出版“年鉴”、“概况”、“名录”等出版物，要求有关单位提供资料并索取编辑出版费，只要交费即可刊出。这种情况在社会上产生了不良影响和后果。为此，湖南省政府规定：
    一、所有“年鉴”、“概况”、“名录”等出版物，只能由正式出版社出版，杂志社、报社及其它非出版单位一律不得组织出版。否则，以非法出版论处。
    二、编辑出版这类出版物，一律不准向供稿单位以任何名义索取任何费用。
    三、此通知下达后，各地、各部门要立即进行一次检查，对违反本通知的，应切实予以纠正，并做好善后工作。
