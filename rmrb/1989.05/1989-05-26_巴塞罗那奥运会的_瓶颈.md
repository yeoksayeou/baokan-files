According to the Barcelona Tourism Bureau's guidebook, "On July 25, 1992, it will be sunny, with an afternoon temperature of 27 degrees Celsius, slightly high; but on the Montjuïc Heights, there will be a gentle breeze." This is their imagined weather scenario for the opening day of the upcoming Olympics. At that time, the main stadium and surrounding sports facilities by the Mediterranean Sea in the southwestern part of the city will attract 670,000 spectators and the attention of approximately 2 billion television viewers worldwide.

Barcelona is the second-largest city in Spain, with a population of 1.7 million, and is a city rich in history and culture. The chairman of the International Olympic Committee's adjustment committee praised the city's competition facilities highly after an inspection, deeming them the most outstanding among all previous Olympic Games.

However, there are concerns about the inadequacies in transportation and accommodation. According to the Olympic Committee, there will be 38,000 people directly involved in the Olympics. The local hotels can only accommodate 15,000 athletes and coaches (including officials) and 8,000 journalists. Accommodation for the remaining 15,000 people, mostly VIPs from various sponsoring organizations, has not been confirmed. These guests have already booked 80% of the local hotel rooms. To meet the demand, 13 new hotels need to be built, but at least 8 of them are still just on paper.

Even without the Olympics, Barcelona receives 14 million tourists annually. Therefore, tourists during the Olympic period will not be able to stay in Barcelona and will have to find accommodations in other cities.

Transportation and accommodation deficiencies will become the bottleneck for the upcoming Olympics.

　　巴塞罗那奥运会的“瓶颈”
    江文
    据巴塞罗那旅游局的导游手册介绍：“１９９２年７月２５日，晴天，下午气温为２７度，略高；但孟久伊克高地上却微风徐徐。”这是他们设想的下届奥运会开幕当天的天气情况。在该市西南部依傍地中海的主体育场及其周围的体育场馆中，届时将吸引６７万观众以及世界各国约２０亿电视观众的注意。
    巴塞罗那是西班牙第二大城市，人口１７０万，是个历史和文化名城。国际奥委会综合调整小组主席视察后对这里的比赛设施大加赞赏，认为是历届奥运会中最出色的。
    但是，使人不无担心的是交通和接待能力不足。据奥运会组委会披露，届时直接与奥运会有关的人将达３．８万，而当地的旅馆仅能接待１．５万名运动员和教练员（包括官员）以及８０００名记者。其他１．５万人的住宿尚无法落实，而其中大多为各赞助单位的贵宾。这些客人已预订了当地８０％的旅馆房间。要满足需求，得新建１３家旅馆，但至少有８家现在仍只是纸上计划。
    即便没有奥运会，巴塞罗那每年的游客亦达１４００万人。因此，奥运会期间的游客均不可能在巴塞罗那下榻，而只能转宿其他城镇。
    交通和接待能力不足将成为下届奥运会的“瓶颈”。
