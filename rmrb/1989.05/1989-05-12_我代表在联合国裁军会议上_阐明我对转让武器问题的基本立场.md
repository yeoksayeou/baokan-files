People's Daily, United Nations, May 11th.

The United Nations Disarmament Committee this afternoon discussed the issue of international arms transfers under the conventional disarmament agenda. China's representative, Ambassador Fan Guoxiang, articulated China's fundamental stance on this issue for the first time.

1. The issue of international arms transfers should be approached with a serious, cautious, and responsible attitude. Arms transfers must aid in maintaining the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of the relevant countries, and help them maintain necessary and reasonable defensive capabilities. No country should use arms transfers as a means to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

2. International arms transfers should benefit the just struggles of peoples under colonial rule and foreign occupation, promoting the realization or restoration of their inalienable rights to self-determination and independence.

3. International arms transfers should contribute to maintaining and enhancing the peace, security, and stability of the relevant regions and the world.

4. Countries and regimes that violate the UN Charter and basic principles of international relations by engaging in aggression, expansion, military occupation, and practicing racism and colonial rule should be strictly prohibited from receiving any form of arms transfers. Relevant countries should take effective measures to stop arms transfers linked to drug trafficking and international terrorism, and strengthen international cooperation in this regard.

5. The issue of international arms transfers should be addressed in conjunction with easing international tensions, resolving regional conflicts, halting the arms race, and achieving effective disarmament under supervision.

6. Based on the aforementioned principles, it is possible to reasonably regulate and restrict international arms transfers to promote stability at a lower level of armaments, thereby enhancing world peace and security.

7. The largest arms suppliers have a special responsibility to regulate and restrict international arms transfers and should take the lead in taking action. The United States and the Soviet Union should take the lead in implementing effective self-restraining measures, including significantly reducing their arms exports, to create favorable conditions for consultations and negotiations among arms-supplying and receiving countries on the reasonable regulation and restriction of international arms transfers.

8. It is encouraged that arms-supplying and receiving countries, as well as other relevant countries, based on the principles contained in the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the UN General Assembly, which was the first special session dedicated to disarmament, engage in consultations and negotiations on an equal footing to reach agreements on the reasonable regulation and restriction of international arms transfers.

9. The United Nations should play a beneficial role in the reasonable regulation and restriction of international arms transfers. For example, it should urge the largest arms suppliers to fulfill their special responsibilities by taking the lead in implementing self-restraining measures, encourage countries to consult and reach agreements on the reasonable regulation and restriction of arms transfers, and provide necessary consultation and technical services to countries. It should also study and formulate effective measures to address prohibited arms transfers.

　　我代表在联合国裁军会议上    
    阐明我对转让武器问题的基本立场
    本报联合国５月１１日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国裁军审议委员会今天下午在常规裁军项目下审议国际武器转让问题，中国代表范国祥大使在会上首次阐明了中国对此问题的基本立场。
    １、对国际武器转让问题，应当采取严肃、慎重、负责的态度。武器转让必须有助于维护有关国家的独立、主权和领土完整，有助于它们保持必要、合理的防卫能力。任何国家不得以武器转让为手段干涉别国的内政。
    ２、国际武器转让应当有利于殖民地和被外国侵略占领下的人民的正义斗争，促进实现或恢复其民族自决和独立的不容剥夺的权利。
    ３、国际武器转让应有助于维护和增强有关地区和世界的和平、安全和稳定。
    ４、对违背联合国宪章和国际关系基本准则而向别国进行侵略扩张和军事占领，以及实行种族主义和殖民统治的国家和政权，应当严格禁止向其进行任何形式的武器转让。有关国家应采取有力措施，制止与贩毒和国际恐怖主义等不法行为相联系的国际武器转让，并加强在这方面的国际合作。
    ５、国际武器转让问题应同缓和国际紧张局势、消除地区冲突、制止军备竞赛、实现有效监督下的裁军等问题联系处理。
    ６、在遵循上述原则的基础上，可对国际武器转让进行合理的调节和限制，以促进实现在低军备水平上的稳定，增进世界和平与安全。
    ７、最大的武器供应国对于调节和限制国际武器转让负有特殊责任，应当率先采取行动。美苏应当率先采取切实、有效的自我限制措施，包括大幅度地减少它们的武器出口，以便为各武器供应国和接受国就合理地调节和限制国际武器转让进行磋商和谈判创造有利的条件。
    ８、应鼓励武器供应国和接受国以及其他有关国家，基于各国安全不受损害等载于联合国大会第十届特别会议，即第一届专门讨论裁军问题的特别会议的《最后文件》中的有关原则，在平等的基础上进行磋商和谈判，并达成关于合理地调节和限制国际武器转让的协议。
    ９、联合国对合理地调节和限制国际武器转让应发挥有益的作用。例如，应督促最大的武器供应国履行其特殊责任，率先采取自我限制措施，鼓励各国就合理地调节和限制武器转让进行磋商并达成协议，并为各国提供必要的咨询和技术性服务；研究和制定对应予禁止的武器转让行为采取必要的有效措施。
