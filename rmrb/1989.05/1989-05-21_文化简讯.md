At the invitation of the Chinese Academy of Art, a delegation led by Mitsuji Michio from Japan visited China in early May for a two-week tour and artistic exchange. The delegation consists of five outstanding Japanese artists—Kanze Kiyokazu, Nomura Mansaku, Sugihara Hiroshi, Kenta Kiyotsugu, and Hanayagi Shidō—and nineteen performers from their respective schools. They performed traditional Japanese arts such as Noh, Kyogen, Japanese dance, and traditional Japanese music in Beijing, Luoyang, Xi'an, and other cities, showcasing the essence of Japanese traditional arts.
