Xinhua News Agency, Zunyi,

China now has 42 evening newspapers. These 42 evening newspapers cover all provincial capitals, autonomous region capitals, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and a significant number of medium and small-sized cities, except for Taiwan Province. This was stated by a responsible person from the All-China Evening Newspaper Workers' Association in Zunyi City, where the preliminary round of the National Evening Newspaper Social News Awards was held, when introducing the development of China's evening newspaper industry to a reporter.

Before the Cultural Revolution, China had only 13 evening newspapers. The rest were established after 1980. The newly established provincial capital of Hainan Province, Haikou City, also started publishing an evening newspaper.

Currently, the total daily circulation of evening newspapers nationwide reaches 10 million copies. Li Pu, an advisor to the All-China Evening Newspaper Workers' Association, said that this development speed is remarkable, indicating the prosperity and progress of the country.

    新华社遵义电（记者刘志杰）“我国晚报已发展到４２家。这４２家晚报覆盖了除台湾省外的全国各省省会、自治区首府、直辖市和相当一部分中小城市。”这是全国晚报工作者协会负责人在全国晚报社会新闻大奖赛初评地遵义市，向记者介绍我国晚报事业发展情况时说的。
    我国晚报在“文革”前仅有１３家，其余的是在１９８０年后陆续创办的。新建的海南省省会海口市也创办了晚报。
    目前，全国晚报日发行量达１０００万份。全国晚报工作者协会顾问李普说，这个发展速度可观，说明国家的繁荣与进步。
