		Internationally Awarded, Domestically Struggling:
		Chen Haosu Calls for Support for Educational Films

		Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai - (Trainee Hong Bing) Films that were once known as the "screen professors" and the "money bringers" are now facing economic difficulties. Chen Haosu, Deputy Minister of the Broadcasting Film and Television Department, recently at the "1989 China International Science and Education Film Festival" press conference, called for society to pay attention to and support the development of science and education films.

		Chen Haosu believes that science and education films are an important part of the cultural and educational sector. To improve the status of science and education films in social life, he called on relevant departments to support the production of science and education films from aspects such as filming and distribution. It is understood that low ticket prices and products that cannot be marketed are the main difficulties facing China's science and education films at present. Film distribution companies limit the purchase of 300 science and education films each year to avoid losses, while the Beijing Science and Education Film Studio alone produces 200 films a year.

		Last year, China won 54 international film awards, 90% of which were for science and education films. According to statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the promotion of the technology introduced in the film "Plastic Film Covering" alone increased China's agricultural production by 6 billion yuan. Therefore, protecting and supporting science and education films that produce good social and economic benefits has become a strong call from the public.

　　国际获奖硕果累累  国内拍片困难重重   
    陈昊苏希望社会扶持科教影片
    新华社上海电  （实习生洪兵）过去被人们称为“银幕教授”和送上门的“财神爷”的科教影片，近年却陷入了经济上的困境。广播电影电视部副部长陈昊苏日前在“１９８９中国国际科教电影节”新闻发布会上，希望社会各界重视和扶持科教影片的发展。
    陈昊苏认为，科教影片是文化教育事业的重要组成部分。为提高科教影片在社会生活中的地位，他呼吁有关部门能从摄制、发行等方面，支持科教影片的生产。据了解，票价低、产品无法投入市场是我国科教影片目前面临的主要困难。电影发行公司每年为避免亏损只限额收购３００部科教片，而北京科教电影制片厂一家年摄制量就有２００部。
    我国去年获得的５４项国际影奖中，科教影片占了９０％。据农业部统计，仅由于推广《地膜覆盖》一片中介绍的技术，就使我国农业生产增加６０亿元产值。所以，保护和扶持产生良好社会与经济效益的科教影片，已形成人们强烈的呼声。
