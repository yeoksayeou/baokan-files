On the second day after a baby is born, they should receive the BCG vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine. The hepatitis B vaccine should be administered again in the second and sixth months. When the baby is three months old, they should take one dose of the oral polio vaccine and receive one injection of the DPT vaccine (diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus combined vaccine). At four months, the same procedure should be followed: one dose of the oral polio vaccine and one injection of the DPT vaccine. At eight months, the baby should again take one dose of the oral polio vaccine, receive one injection of the DPT vaccine, and also get one injection of the measles vaccine. At one and a half years, the child should receive one injection of the DPT vaccine and one injection of the measles vaccine. Children who are one year old should receive two injections of the Japanese encephalitis vaccine between the end of April and the beginning of May (with a one-week interval between the two injections). This should be repeated in the same time frame in the second and third years. Children aged one to four should receive one injection of the meningococcal vaccine between the end of November and the beginning of December each year. In case of an epidemic, an additional vaccination should be administered. In addition to the scheduled vaccinations, parents should also pay attention to any signs of infectious diseases spreading and consult the health station for advice on additional vaccinations for their children.
