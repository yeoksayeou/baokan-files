Title: The North Case is Far from Over

The North case has once again become the focus of the American public and news media. Cameras from various news organizations are aimed at the entrances of the Washington District Court where North is being tried, fearing they might miss a single shot; many people have gathered at the courthouse before dawn, hoping to catch a glimpse of this "legendary" figure; a television station has been continuously broadcasting a long TV series about North's experiences, "Courage and Glory"… This is not just because North played a key role in the mysterious "Iran-Contra affair," nor is it because since the end of 1986, American taxpayers have already spent $40 million on the investigation and trial of the North case. More importantly, people's views on North have formed two distinct camps of "hero" and "criminal," and both sides are anxiously awaiting the grand jury's decision on North's fate.

On the afternoon of the 4th, after 12 days of deliberation, a jury composed of 9 women and 3 men from the District of Columbia finally announced that out of the 12 charges, 3 were found guilty. Thus, the North case, which began its formal trial on February 21, finally has a result.

From this verdict, both the prosecution and the defense have reasons to be satisfied. The prosecutor believes that the North case, from indictment to trial, overcame many "unprecedented" complex obstacles, such as issues involving "national security and foreign relations" secret documents and the subpoena of former President Reagan, ultimately determining that the defendant had "three very serious illegal acts," making North face a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $750,000 fine; no matter who, regardless of their position or importance, no one is above the law, this principle has been proven again. North's side believes that North's 12 criminal charges, with a maximum sentence of 60 years in prison and a $3 million fine, were reduced to 3 charges, indicating that the jury accepted most of the defense. However, if one thinks that the North case will be over after Judge Gesell's sentencing on June 23, it is obviously too early.

Firstly, this trial avoided the core of the "Iran-Contra affair." Initially, North's 14 charges included the most crucial ones: conspiracy and theft of government property, with the main offense being the secret transfer of $14 million in profits from the sale of weapons to Iran to the Nicaraguan contra rebels without informing Congress. However, due to the involvement of subpoenaing the then-president and presenting government secret documents, it raised issues of "major legal and constitutional" and "national security and foreign relations," resulting in nothing. The media had long pointed out that such a trial that avoids the heavy issues cannot solve the mysteries surrounding the "Iran-Contra affair."

Secondly, even with the remaining lighter 12 charges, 9 of them were found to have insufficient evidence, and the defendant still does not admit guilt. During the trial, North admitted that using the received funds to install a security system for his home to prevent terrorist attacks was "the stupidest thing he had ever done" in his life, but he denied all other charges. After the jury's verdict, he immediately stated that he would fight to the end like a Marine, no matter how many years it takes, until he is ultimately proven innocent. North's lawyer also stated that he would appeal all three charges. According to American legal procedures, this "marathon" lawsuit will drag on for who knows how many years.

Furthermore, the defense's center during the trial was that North had been "faithfully" executing the orders of the White House throughout the "Iran-Contra affair." He was just a "scapegoat" who was abandoned, taking the blame for others. He requested that President Reagan, who "knew and directly approved the entire plan," testify in court, but this was strongly opposed by the White House and the Department of Justice and did not succeed; the direct commander of the secret aid to the Nicaraguan contra rebels, former CIA Director Casey, is now "dead without a witness"; the secret deals between the White House and some national leaders or governments remain unclear to this day... This series of new issues were all raised during the trial and will likely appear again in the trial of another key figure, former White House National Security Advisor Poindexter.

American media figures pointed out that this trial shows that even the jury with the power to decide will not believe that "Mr. North is the only, or even the main, lawbreaker."

　　诺思案了犹未了
    本报记者  仓立德
    这两天，诺思再次成为美国公众和新闻媒介的中心人物。一些新闻机构的摄相机对准审判诺思的华盛顿地区法院的各个通道，生怕错过一个镜头；不少人天未亮就涌到法院门口，等着看上一眼这位心目中的“传奇性”人物；一家电视台连续播放描写诺思经历的长篇电视剧《勇气和光荣》……这倒不单单是因为诺思在神秘的“伊朗门”事件中扮演了一个关键性角色，也不是因为自１９８６年底以来美国纳税人为诺思案的调查和审判已付出的４０００万美元巨款，更重要的是人们对诺思的看法形成“英雄”和“罪犯”两种泾渭分明的阵营，双方都在焦灼地等待大陪审团对诺思命运的裁决。
    ４日下午，经过长达１２天的审议，由哥伦比亚特区９女３男共１２位公民组成的陪审团终于宣布，在１２项起诉中有３项罪名成立。至此，自２月２１日正式开庭的诺思案总算有了结果。
    从这项裁决看，原告、被告双方都有理由感到满意。检察官认为，诺思案由起诉到审判，克服了许多“没有先例”的复杂障碍，如涉及“国家安全和对外关系”的秘密文件问题，传唤前总统里根问题等，最终确定被告“有３处十分严重的违法行为”，使诺思面临最高１０年徒刑和７５万美元罚款的法律制裁；无论何人，不管其职位高下、重要与否均不得凌驾法律之上，这一原则再次得到证明。诺思一方则认为，诺思由１２项刑事罪名、最高可被判６０年徒刑和３００万美元罚金降为３项罪名，说明陪审团认可了大部分辩护。但是，若认为诺思案只待格塞尔法官６月２３日宣判便一了百了，显然还为时过早。
    首先，这次审判回避了“伊朗门”事件的核心。当初确定诺思的１４项罪名中，最关键的两项是诺思犯有阴谋罪和盗窃政府财产罪，主要罪状是私自将卖给伊朗军火的１４００万美元利润瞒着国会秘密转给了尼加拉瓜反政府武装。但由于牵涉传唤当时的总统及出示政府机密文件，引起“重大法律与宪法”及“国家安全与外交关系”问题，结果不了了之。舆论界早就指出，这种避重就轻的审判根本无法解开笼罩“伊朗门”事件的重重谜团。
    其次，即便剩下较轻的１２项罪名，其中又有９项被判定证据不足，被告仍然不服。在庭审中，诺思除承认用接受的款项为自己的住宅建立一套安全装置以防止恐怖分子袭击一事是他“一生中所干的最蠢的事”外，其余一概不承认有罪。陪审团裁决后，他立即表示要像一名海军陆战队战士那样战斗到底，不管要用多少年，直至最终证明无罪。诺思的律师也表示要对３项罪名全部提出上诉。按照美国的法律程序，这场“马拉松”式的诉讼不知要拖到何年何月。
    再有，被告一方在审判中辩护的中心，即诺思在“伊朗门”事件中自始至终“忠实”地执行了白宫当局的命令，他不过是一只被抛弃的“替罪羊”，是代人受过。他要求“知晓并直接批准全部方案”的里根总统到庭作证，但遭到白宫和司法部的强烈反对而未果；秘密援助尼反政府武装的直接指挥者、前中央情报局局长凯西已是“死无对证”；白宫与一些国家首脑或政府达成的秘密交易至今仍是不明不白……这一系列新问题都是在审判中提出来的，看来在今后审判另一位关键人物、前白宫国家安全事务助理波因德克斯特时还会出现。
    美国舆论界人士指出，这次审判说明，即便是掌握裁决权的陪审团也不会相信“诺思先生是唯一的、甚或是主要的违法者”。
