	Suzhou's Numerous Bared Hills Urgently Need Afforestation
	In early March, I went to Suzhou on a business trip and took the opportunity to visit Guangfu Town in Wuxian County to appreciate the plum blossoms. Along the way from Suzhou City to Guangfu Town, I traversed mountains and hills, but all I saw were barren hills and bare mountains. Seeing the "paradise on earth" of Suzhou reduced to such desolation, my enthusiasm for sightseeing vanished. Wuxian County has tens of thousands of acres of mountainous land, just a few kilometers away from Suzhou City. Afforesting these hills and mountains is very important for the tourist city of Suzhou. Spring is the best season for planting trees in the south, yet I did not see anyone planting trees or preparing the land on the mountains. On the contrary, I often saw people breaking branches while admiring the plum blossoms, and the hills behind the Tan Mountain Sanatorium in Guangfu Town were shrouded in smoke. I suggest that the relevant departments of Suzhou City take measures to afforest these barren hills as soon as possible.

　　苏州大量荒山亟需绿化
    阳春３月，我到苏州出差，顺便到吴县光福镇去赏梅。从苏州市到光福镇，一路翻山越岭，但满目荒山秃岭，见到“地上天堂”的苏州尽是荒凉的秃山，我游兴顿失。吴县有山地几十万亩，距苏州市仅几公里，绿化这些山岭对于旅游名城苏州是很重要的。春天是江南植树的好季节，我却没看见山上有人植树或整地，相反，只见赏梅人折枝屡屡，光福镇潭山疗养院后山烟火缭绕。建议苏州市有关部门采取措施，尽快绿化这些荒山。
