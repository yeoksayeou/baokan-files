The 22nd Annual Meeting of the Asian Development Bank opened today at 10 a.m. in the Great Hall of the People. More than 3,000 high-level officials, financiers, and observers from international organizations from 47 member countries and regions attended the opening ceremony.

Chinese President Yang Shangkun delivered a speech at the opening ceremony, calling on developed countries to take practical measures in finance, trade, technology, debt, and commodities to facilitate the economic growth of developing countries. He said, "This is a global issue and an important part of establishing a new international economic order."

After highly praising the achievements of economic development in the Asia-Pacific region over the past 10 years, he pointed out that to achieve universal prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region, there is still a long way to go. The Asia-Pacific region should strengthen cooperation with other regions of the world, open up to each other, and develop together.

The chairman of this year's meeting, Governor of the People's Bank of China Li Guixian, said in his speech that in the past 10 years, the average economic growth rate in the Asia-Pacific region has been higher than in other regions of the world. However, there are obvious imbalances in development between developed countries and developing countries, and between developing countries with different bases and conditions. Poverty and backwardness still exist seriously, and they face severe environmental problems and rapid population growth. He believes that it is necessary to strengthen regional cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and strengthen cooperation with other regions of the world to achieve universal prosperity.

Asian Development Bank President Masao Fujioka reviewed the achievements of the ADB over the past year and pointed out that in the future, the ADB should increase its assistance to developing member countries in this region, especially focusing on the 500 million poor people in this region, helping them to fight against poverty. The ADB will make active efforts to promote cooperation among Asian countries in trade, investment, and finance, and to promote economic development in the Asian region.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Chen Muhua also attended the opening ceremony.

    本报北京５月４日讯　记者李红、蒋千红、吴迎春报道：亚洲开发银行理事会第二十二届年会今天上午十时在人民大会堂隆重开幕。来自４７个成员国家和地区的高级官员、金融家以及国际组织的观察员等３０００余人出席了开幕仪式。
    中华人民共和国主席杨尚昆在开幕式上致词，呼吁发达国家在金融、贸易、技术、债务、商品等方面采取切实措施，以利于发展中国家的经济增长。他说：“这是一个全球性的大问题，也是建立国际经济新秩序的重要内容。”
    在高度评价了过去１０年亚太地区经济发展的成就之后，他指出，要实现亚太地区的普遍繁荣，今后还有很长的路要走。亚太地区要和世界其他地区加强合作，相互开放，共同发展。
    本届年会主席、中国人民银行行长李贵鲜在讲话中说，在过去１０年中，亚太地区的经济平均增长率高于世界其他地区。然而，在发达国家与发展中国家之间，基础和条件不同的发展中国家之间，存在着明显的发展不平衡。贫困、落后依然严重存在，并面临着严峻的环境和人口急剧增加等问题。他认为，应当在平等互利基础上加强区域合作并加强与世界其他地区间合作，实现世界的普遍繁荣。
    亚洲开发银行行长藤冈真佐夫回顾了亚行在过去１年中取得的成就后指出，今后亚行要增加对这一地区发展中成员国的援助，要特别关注本地区５亿贫困人民，帮助他们同贫困作斗争。亚行将作出积极努力，推动亚洲各国在贸易、投资和金融等方面的合作，促进亚洲地区的经济发展。
    全国人大常委会副委员长陈慕华也出席了开幕式。
