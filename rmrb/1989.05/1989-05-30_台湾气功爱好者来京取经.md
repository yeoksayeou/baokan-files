The vice-chairman of the National Medical Qigong Science Research Association, Professor Feng Lida, and other Qigong research experts recently taught Qigong scientific theory and techniques to more than 30 Taiwanese enthusiasts who came to Beijing specifically for this purpose.

The Qigong training class, led by Professor Feng Lida, taught Taiwanese colleagues the fundamentals of Chinese Qigong, Qigong immunology, and clinical Qigong, among other theories. They also taught the principles and methods of static and dynamic Qigong. The successor of the Wild Goose Qigong, 94-year-old Yang Meijun, also specially demonstrated the Wild Goose Qigong techniques for the Taiwanese Qigong enthusiasts.

The Taiwanese Qigong enthusiasts expressed great satisfaction with this Qigong teaching activity. Wu Changxin, the founder of the Taiwan Qigong Association, and others said they hope to further strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the Qigong communities on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. They also hope that the soon-to-be-established China Qigong Medical College will establish a branch in Taiwan, allowing the descendants of the Yellow Emperor living in Taiwan to share the medical achievements of the motherland.

    新华社北京五月二十九日电  全国医学气功科学研究会副会长冯理达教授等气功研究专家，近日向专程来北京的三十多名台湾爱好者传授气功科学理论和技术。
    由冯理达教授主持的气功学习班，向台湾同行讲授了中国气功学概论、气功免疫学、临床气功学等理论，还传授了静动功、养心功等气功功理、功法。大雁功的传人、九十四岁的杨梅君老人，还专门向台湾气功爱好者做了大雁功的功法表演。
    台湾气功爱好者对这次气功教学活动颇表满意，台湾气功学会创建人吴长新教授等表示，希望今后进一步加强海峡两岸气功学界的交流联系，希望筹建中的中华气功医学院将来在台湾开办分院，使居住在台湾的炎黄子孙能共享祖国的医学成果。
