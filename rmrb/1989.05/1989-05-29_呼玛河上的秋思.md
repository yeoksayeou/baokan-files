Autumn. The blue waters of the Huma River flow clear as a mirror, reflecting the silver birch trees and green pine trees on both banks, accompanied by the grass, breeze, birdsong, and fragrance of flowers along the shore, winding south from the city of Tahe.

In the evening, she and he walk along the riverbank. Both are over 40 years old. From their expressions, they seem both close and distant, familiar and strange, casual and restrained. They walk silently, their steps very light, very light. The distant sunset glows like fire, and the scattered red light filtering through the trees illuminates their serious faces. He swings a willow branch in his hand. She plays with a bunch of wildflowers she picked from the ground.

"You came all the way from Fujian, it's not easy. Rest for a few days first..." He stops and looks at her.

She nods, smiling bitterly. The clear water reflects their swaying figures... The ripples on the green waves are like bright, sorrowful eyes, recounting the "unbearable past"?

People's experiences are like the farming on the fields. You reap what you sow. The seeds of time sprout and bear fruit. She gains a magnificent life, while he bears eternal guilt... Her and his feelings towards the Huma River are completely different...

She is very beautiful, with the delicate, charming, and serene beauty of a southern woman. She comes from a wealthy merchant family in Xiamen, Fujian, who had migrated to Thailand. He is a "red" son of a poor peasant from Liaoning. In the autumn of 1965, they both graduated from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Institute and were assigned to work in this Great Xing'anling forest area. She gave up the opportunity to work in Beijing and resolutely came to this most arduous post—the forest survey team. They were proud to be pioneers of the great forest.

Once, they had to go to the other side of the Huma River to carry out a survey mission in the primitive forest. He said he was not feeling well and asked to stay in the tent. She and six men crossed the river from here. In the middle of the river, their small boat suddenly capsized, and the six men were buried in the swift and deep abyss. Only she was washed to a small island in the middle of the river and survived by clinging to a tree branch... The Huma River wept, silently sobbing without words, rolling wave after wave of white foam... Ah, the heart-wrenching Huma River!

The next autumn, when the unprecedented catastrophe of the "Cultural Revolution" swept through the great forest, the temperature here suddenly dropped to minus 51 degrees Celsius. The air seemed to freeze, with only vast white mist, smoke, wind, and snow dancing and roaring. In the morning, on their way back from getting food, her glove fell off. She felt her hand was cold and warmed it with her breath, loudly complaining: "This cold is so annoying!" She looked up at the faintly rising sun and said, "The sun in the Great Xing'anling is smaller than the sun in the interior, too cold, why doesn't the red sun shine on this place!" For this one sentence, she was labeled a "current counter-revolutionary." Because of his denunciation and her overseas connections, her defense only deepened her "crimes." From then on, she was imprisoned in the "cow shed" for five years, then deported to her original residence and subjected to reform through labor...

Spring came late. When she returned to the north after twenty years, he had already become the director of the forestry bureau here. Memories were filled with pain, injury, regret, and also yearning... Various complex emotions surged in their hearts like the waves of the Huma River!

"I received a letter from my father in Thailand asking me to inherit the property..." After a long silence, she said in a low voice.

"Are you going?" he asked.

She shook her head. Her face was stern, like a statue, saying, "The Great Xing'anling has given me too much pain, too much. I want to use the rest of my time to create happiness and a new future in the Great Xing'anling..."

He looked at her with a guilty expression, his lips trembling, unable to speak.

She said, "Let the past be past, like this flowing water..."

The two walked to the Huma River bridge. The calm river suddenly widened, like a vast, boundless lake. She affectionately bent down to pick up a beautiful colored pebble and gently threw it into the water, causing a series of jumping water ripples. He also picked up a stone and threw it fiercely into the distance, causing a series of water ripples.

Gone were the splashing water ripples. Gone were the bitter and resentful feelings intertwined in their hearts, along with the waves that flowed away. Ah, the autumn reflections on the Huma River...

    呼玛河上的秋思
    门瑞瑜
    秋日。蓝色的呼玛河流水，清澈如镜，倒映着两岸银色的白桦林和绿色的美人松，伴着岸畔的青草、和风、鸟语、花香，从塔河县城南蜿蜒而去。
    傍晚，她和他沿着河畔走着。两个人年龄在40岁开外，从神情看来，彼此好像很亲近，又很疏远，很熟悉，又很陌生，很随便，又很拘谨，……默默地，脚步很轻，很轻。远方晚霞似火，从树林间筛出的点点红光，映照着她和他的显得严肃的脸庞。他手上舞动着一根柳树枝。她手里玩弄着从地上采撷的一束野花。
    “你从福建来一趟不容易，先好好休息几天……”他停住脚步，望着她。
    她点点头，苦涩地微微一笑。平静的流水清晰地倒映着两个人晃动的身影……那碧波荡漾，多像明媚动人的眼神，是在悲凉地叙说那“不堪回首”的往事吗？
    人的经历就像耕耘收获在田野上的农事。种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆。岁月的种子发芽结果，她得到的是人生的豪迈，而他得到的是永远的愧疚……她和他对这呼玛河的感受是截然不同的……
    她容貌很美。是南方女人那种标致、漂亮、恬静的美。家在福建厦门，出身于一个旅居泰国华侨的富商之家。而他是辽宁农村“根红苗红”的贫农儿子。1965年秋，他们毕业于北京农机学院，同时分配到这大兴安岭林区。她放弃了留在北京工作的机会，毅然决然来到这最艰苦的岗位——森林调查队工作的。他们以大森林的开拓者而自豪。
    有一次，他们要去呼玛河彼岸的原始森林执行测量任务。他说他身体不舒服，要求留在帐篷里。她和6个男人就从这里涉水过河，到了河心，乘坐的小船忽然翻了，一下子涌入河底，那6个男人葬身在急湍的深渊，只有她被冲到河心小岛的树杈子上幸存下来……呼玛河哭了，默默地呜咽无语，激烈地翻滚着一朵又一朵白色的浪花，……啊，荡气回肠的呼玛河！
    第二年秋天，当那场空前浩劫的
  “文革”风暴席卷大森林时，这里自然界的气温却骤然降到零下51摄氏度。空气仿佛凝固了，只有茫茫的白雾，烟沧风雪在飞舞怒吼。早上，在她和他去打饭回屋的路上，她的手套掉了。她感到手冷，用呵气暖暖手，向他大声地发起牢骚：“这冷真讨厌死了！”她抬起头，望着迟迟升起的淡淡的阳光，说：“这大兴安岭上的太阳比关里的太阳小，太冷，为什么红太阳照不到这个鬼地方！”就这一句话，她被打成了“现行反革命分子”。因为有他的揭发在，再加上她的海外关系，她的辩驳只能更加重了她的“罪孽”。从此她被关押进了“牛棚”，一蹲就是5年，后又被遣返原籍，管制劳改……
    春天姗姗来迟。等她一别二十年，重返北国的时候，他已荣任这里的林业局长了。回忆里浸透了痛苦、创伤、懊恼，也伴着憧憬，……多种复杂的感情就像眼下呼玛河翻卷的浪花，涌动在各自的心头！
    “我父亲从泰国来信要我去继承财产……”缄默很久，她低沉地说。
      “你去吗？”他问。
    她摇摇头。脸色严峻，像雕像一样，说：“大兴安岭给我的痛苦太深，太深，我想用今后的时间去创造我在大兴安岭的欢乐和新的未来……”
    ……他面带愧色瞅着他，嘴唇抖动嗫嚅地说不出话。
    她说：“过去的事情就让它永远地过去了，就像这流水一样……”
    两人沿河畔走到呼玛河桥头了。平静的河面顿时宽阔起来，像一汪广袤寥廓的湖泊。她深情地俯下身去捡起一块美丽的彩色鹅卵石子，向水面轻轻抛去，水面上飞溅起一串跳跃的水漂儿。他也顺手把一块石子狠狠地掷向远方，水面上也跳荡起一串水漂儿。
    远去了，那飞溅消逝中的水漂儿。远去了，那感情深处交织着的苦涩和怨恨的心绪，随着一片片流逝的浪花都一去不复返了。啊，那呼玛河上的秋思……
