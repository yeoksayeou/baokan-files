Beijing City Construction Company was established less than six years ago. Its 4,500 employees have an average age of 28. This young team has undertaken the construction of China's first three-tiered rotary interchange bridge—the Beijing Xizhimen Interchange, China's first sports venue designed and constructed according to international standards for the Asian Games—the Changping Cycling Venue, as well as a series of modern, advanced scientific research, communication, production, office, and tourism service projects. All of these projects have met national acceptance standards...

In the process of forging ahead, the company's Party committee realized: the Party has entrusted us with this ship. We must not only set a clear course, ride the winds, and break through the waves, but also guard against hitting reefs and internal leaks. Under the premise of maintaining their own integrity, the members of the company's Party committee conducted in-depth legal and disciplinary education among the employees, leading to 37 individuals with economic problems confessing and surrendering, and the recovery of over 270,000 yuan in illicit gains.

In December 1987, the company's Party committee received a letter from the public accusing a materials clerk in the First Division of the First Team of having economic problems.

"The disciplinary committee should take the lead, with the security department assisting, to investigate the matter thoroughly," said Party Secretary Liu Jianming with a clear stance. After extensive verification, the information in the letter was found to be true: the materials clerk had colluded with an individual entrepreneur, using methods such as privately issuing material allocation slips and falsifying accounts, to embezzle nearly 100,000 yuan.

Since the enterprise's body had developed a "boil," it had to be lanced. Otherwise, it would endanger the entire company.

However, the work was not as easy as it seemed. In the past, the emphasis on "struggle philosophy" and the tendency to exaggerate issues made some Party members and department heads afraid of criticism, reporting only good news and hiding bad news. When problems arose, they often protected their subordinates and the unit protected individuals, based on small group interests. The company's investigation of embezzlers faced concerns that it would affect the company's reputation, and there were fears that the more than 100 materials clerks might stop working, impacting construction and production.

The company's Party committee made it clear: if anyone stops working, we will immediately send replacements. The investigation must be carried out thoroughly, involving whoever is implicated, and pursuing the matter to the end without leniency. Thus, the company sent personnel to assist the Haidian District Procuratorate in conducting internal and external investigations, gathering solid evidence, and promptly holding a lenient but strict meeting at the company. The procuratorial authorities arrested one materials clerk on the spot and released another who had shown meritorious service during the detention and trial period.

According to the development of the situation, with the approval of higher authorities, the Haidian District Procuratorate timely announced the relevant policies for lenient treatment. To reduce the psychological pressure on some individuals, the company kept the confessions of those who surrendered secret within a certain scope and mobilized their family members to cooperate in the work. The security department took safety precautions.

Those with economic problems and hesitations saw that the company's Party organization and the procuratorial authorities were sincerely trying to save them, and they put down their psychological burdens and voluntarily surrendered. Within 10 days, 18 people actively confessed and reported their problems. A usually carefree materials clerk, carrying a large amount of illicit gains, hesitated outside the procuratorate three times, fearing heavy punishment for his personal embezzlement and bribery. One day, when officials from the district procuratorate came to the company to discuss the case, this materials clerk was in a state of panic. Finally, he mustered the courage to confess to the company's security director and exposed the economic crimes of another nine people. According to the policy of leniency for confession, he was not arrested but was ordered to await trial.

His return was like a stone thrown into water, creating ripples. Some individuals with economic problems followed suit. One materials clerk confessed to selling 14 coils of steel privately to an individual entrepreneur in 1984, embezzling 3,000 yuan. He said, "Although this matter was done by me alone and remained unknown for several years, it was always a burden on my mind."

Employees praised the Party committee's serious investigation of economic crimes, giving full affirmation and support. They said, having "family shame" is like having a boil on one's body; it should be treated promptly. If one avoids treating it, it will only get worse. Young employee Li Changxing said: Initially, seeing that 37 people in the company had economic problems, I felt ashamed. But if you think about it, if these people are left unchecked, one might embezzle a few thousand, another a few million, and the company would suffer losses of tens of thousands or even millions. Thinking of this, I feel that the company's lancing of the "boil" is good, and the "family shame" should be exposed!

　　发现“家丑”之后
    ——北京城建一公司清除腐败纪事
    本报记者  赵兴林
    北京市城建一公司组建不到６年，它的４５００名职工，平均年龄２８岁。就是这支年轻的队伍，先后承建了我国第一座三层转盘式立交桥——北京西直门立交桥，我国第一个按国际标准设计和组织施工的亚运会工程昌平自行车赛场，还有一批具有现代化先进水平的科研、通讯、生产、办公和旅游服务工程。工程质量均达到国家验收标准……
    在开拓前进的进程中，这个公司的党委意识到：党把这艘航船交给我们，我们既要看准航向，乘长风，破万里浪，又要防止碰撞暗礁和自身渗漏。该公司党委成员在自身廉洁的前提下，在企业职工中深入进行法纪教育，促使３７个有经济问题的人坦白自首，收缴赃款２７万余元。
    １９８７年１２月，公司党委收到一封检举一处一队某材料员有经济问题的群众来信。
    “请纪委牵头，保卫科配合，把问题查个水落石出。”党委书记刘建明态度非常鲜明。经多方查证，信中揭发的材料属实：那个材料员与社会上一个个体户勾结，采用私开拨料单、做假帐的办法，从中受贿近万元。
    既然企业肌体出现“脓包”，就要挤破。否则，会危害整个公司。
    可是工作开展起来并非那么容易。过去提倡“斗争哲学”、搞无限上纲，使一些共产党员和部门领导害怕批评，工作报喜不报忧。出了问题，往往从小团体利益出发，上级包庇下级，单位包庇个人。公司要清查贪污受贿者，有人担心会影响公司声誉，也有人怕那上百个材料员撂挑子，影响施工生产。
    公司党委明确表示：如果有人撂挑子，就及时派人补上去。清查工作一定要搞好，牵涉到谁就查谁，一查到底，绝不手软。于是，公司派人配合海淀区检察院，通过内查外调，掌握了确凿证据，及时在公司召开宽严大会。检察机关当场逮捕了一个材料员，释放了在押受审期间有立功表现的另一个材料员。
    根据形势的发展，经上级批准，海淀区检察院又适时公布有关宽大处理的政策界限。为了减轻一些人的心理压力，公司对坦白自首者在一定范围内保密，并动员其家属配合做工作，保卫部门采取安全防范措施。
    那些有经济问题、思想有顾虑的人，看到公司党组织和检察机关诚心诚意地挽救自己，便放下思想包袱，纷纷投案自首。１０天之内，就有１８人主动坦白交待了问题。有个平时大大咧咧的材料员，三次携带巨额赃款在检察院外徘徊，担心个人贪污受贿赃款数额大处罚重，迈出的脚步一次又一次缩回来。一天，当区检察院的同志来公司研究案情时，这个材料员惊恐万状。最后终于鼓足勇气，向公司保卫科长做了交待，并揭发了另外９人的经济犯罪问题。按照坦白从宽政策，没有逮捕他，只是令其候审。
    他的归来，如一石击水，荡起千层涟漪。一些有经济问题的人，纷纷效仿。有个材料员坦白交待了１９８４年私自将公司１４盘盘条卖给一个体户，得赃款３０００元的事。他说：“这件事虽是我一人所为，而且好几年无人知晓，但压在心里，总是个事。”
    职工对党委认真清查经济犯罪的做法，给予充分肯定和支持。他们说，有了“家丑”，就像一个人身上长了脓包，应赶快医治；如讳疾忌医，就会越捂越烂。青年职工李长星说：起初看到本公司３７人有经济问题，总觉得脸上无光。但你细一想，对这些人如果放任不管，这个弄几千，那个弄几万，公司就要损失几万、几十万。想到这些，觉得公司挤“脓包”挤得好，“家丑”该外扬！
