Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 13th.

	For the purpose of persuading Ito Masayoshi to take over as the president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the four party leaders held another meeting this afternoon at the LDP headquarters. After the meeting, the acting secretary-general of the LDP, Takako Miki, said in a press conference that the meeting again urged Ito to take the position, but failed to change Ito's mind. Reluctantly, the four party leaders decided to abandon the effort to persuade Ito further.

	Takako also mentioned that no other candidates for the presidency were proposed during the meeting. Starting next Tuesday, the party will begin to consult with senior party members to re-examine the issue of the presidential succession.

	Public opinion suggests that the meeting ended in disagreement because Abe and Watanabe could not accept Ito's condition, which is that the LDP's powerful figures involved in the Recruit stock scandal must resign from their parliamentary seats. Since Buntaro Bando indicated his intention to resign on April 25, the efforts to persuade Ito to take the presidency have come to an end. Given that no other suitable candidates can be proposed at present, the negotiations over the next president are bound to become protracted.

　　苦劝伊东出山未成  自民党另觅新总裁
    本报东京５月１３日电  记者于青报道：为说服伊东正义接任自民党总裁，今天下午，自民党四党首再次在自民党总部举行会议。自民党代理干事长挢本龙太郎在会谈后的记者会见中说，会谈中再次要求伊东接任总裁，但未能改变伊东的想法。无可奈何，自民党四党首会议决定放弃继续说服伊东的打算。
    挢本还说，会谈中没有提出另外的总裁继任人选，从下周星期二开始，在听取党内长老意见的基础上，重新研究总裁继任人选问题。
    舆论认为，会谈不欢而散的原因是，安倍和渡边未能接受伊东的条件，即涉嫌利库路特股票丑闻的自民党实力人物必须辞去国会议员。从４月２５日竹下示意辞职以来，说服伊东出任总裁的努力，到今天告一段落。由于目前提不出其他合适人选，围绕后任总裁的斡旋难免变得长期化。
