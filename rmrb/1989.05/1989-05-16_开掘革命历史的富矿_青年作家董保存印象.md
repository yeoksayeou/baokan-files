Mining the Rich Veins of Revolutionary History
– An Impression of Young Writer Dong Baocun
Huang Guozhu

I first met Dong Baocun in the summer of 1985 during a trip to the northeastern border. At that time, he was still studying at the Literature Department of the PLA Academy of Art. My fellow travelers included his classmates Li Cunbao, Yu Jing, Cheng Ping, and young writer Li Ping, among others. We were stranded on Dalan Mountain Island by a typhoon for several days. Finally, we boarded a fishing boat to land at Pikou and parted ways. Dong Baocun, along with Yu Jing, Cheng Ping, and Li Ping, rode donkeys north to Dandong. That scene is still vivid in my memory.

Later, he told me that riding donkeys was not his first time. In 1972, he enlisted in the army in Ningwu, Shanxi, and first served as a gunner for the Type 82 recoilless rifle. Soon after, he became a film projectionist for the regiment's film team, often driving a donkey cart to various companies to show movies. Anyone who has served in the army as a soldier knows that there are countless stories to tell, and for a long time, "donkey jeep" was a topic of our jokes.

What surprised me was that Dong Baocun was different from other military writers. The work that earned him his reputation as a writer was not about military life. When I first read the novella "Ahead is the Red Lamp," I found it hard to believe it was written by Dong Baocun. This novel depicts the lifelong mental burden and tragic fate of a "deserter" from a revolutionary army, and it is quite innovative. Later, I read a series of his works: "Dream, Green," "Montgomery in China," "The Truth About the Yang-Yu-Fu Incident" ... most of them are based on historical themes. The soon-to-be-published long-form documentary literature "August Tragedy" describes the major tragic event of the August failure during the Jinggangshan period, vividly portraying Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Chen Yi, Wang Erzhuo, Lin Biao, and others at that time, without embellishment or fabrication, striving to achieve "truth and authenticity." Everyone who reads this work feels "a considerable shock." There is also a long-form documentary literature set against the background of the purge and anti-AB team during the Red Army period; a reportage "The Upright Speaker" reflecting General Tan Zhenlin's life experiences before and after the Cultural Revolution, both of which will be published soon. Along with the novels "Lanterns at Dusk," "Their Opponent is a Woman," and the short story collections "Only Four People," "Ahead is the Red Lamp," he has already published five books.

Dong Baocun's interest in Chinese revolutionary history can be traced back at least ten years. When he helped Mo Wenhuai write his memoir "Before and After the Liberation of Beijing," what was presented to a 25-year-old young soldier was such an incredibly rich and diverse treasure trove. Perhaps from that time on, he set his literary compass to this treasure trove. Then, Xiao Ke, Yang Dezhi, Yang Chengwu, Zeng Zhi, Cao Lihuai, Ouyang Yi, Fu Chongbi ... one after another, the fates of these distinguished and long-suffering revolutionary predecessors entered his field of vision. He discovered the secrets of the fate of this revolutionary army, mainly composed of Chinese peasants, not only seeing the source of the driving force behind the predecessors' glorious achievements but also seeing the filth and tragedy in the revolutionary process, which in turn brought him deep confusion. This further increased his attraction to mining this treasure trove. Therefore, he not only delved into the rich historical materials of the revolution but also took every opportunity to interview the older generation of revolutionaries, almost traveling through half of China, conducting on-site investigations, field trips, and searches ... The deeper he delved into the depths of revolutionary history, the more he felt the value of leaving the precious heritage of the predecessors to the next generation. He has repeatedly mentioned that when he was a soldier, he participated in the demolition of the ancient city wall of Ningwu County—destroying ancient cultural relics without realizing it. Today, he realizes the foolishness of his past actions, but the relics are gone forever. The issue is to avoid such foolish actions from happening again, and every writer has the responsibility to do so.

Although he writes about history, his many years of military life have undoubtedly given him great help. He not only understands the necessity of persistent exploration driven by a sense of responsibility but also understands the risks and costs of writing "historical truth." Knowledge of war and military affairs undoubtedly helps him avoid many misunderstandings and omissions that young people often make when writing history, not to mention that without familiarity and understanding of the internal life of the military, it is impossible to depict the true image and soul of our high-ranking military leaders. Some of his works, such as the novel "Lanterns at Dusk," have military personnel as the protagonist, full of familiarity and understanding of the rhythm of contemporary reform and opening-up life. The most fundamental reference for anyone observing history is undoubtedly reality. Therefore, Croce said, "All history is contemporary history." And Dong Baocun obviously gains the best angle to re-examine revolutionary history from the two fulcrums of his understanding of contemporary history and his military life experience.

　　开掘革命历史的富矿   
    ——青年作家董保存印象
    黄国柱
    和董保存相识，始于１９８５年夏天那次东北边疆行。那时他还在解放军艺术学院文学系学习，同行的还有他的同学李存葆、于劲、成平及青年作家礼平等等。我们被台风阻隔在大长山岛上，延误了好几天。最后搭渔民的运输船在皮口登陆，分手时，他和于劲、成平、礼平一起坐毛驴车北上丹东，那景象还历历在目。
    后来他告诉我，坐毛驴车对他来说并非头一遭，１９７２年入伍到山西宁武，先是做八二无后座力炮的炮手，不久当了团电影组的放映员，常常赶着毛驴车去各连放电影。凡是在部队当过大头兵的人，谈起来总有几天几夜也扯不完的话题，很长时间里，“驴吉普”是我们互相打趣的一个内容。
    令我奇怪的是，董保存和其它的军队作家不一样，使他获得作家声誉的不是写军营生活的作品。当我最初读到中篇小说《前面是血红的灯》的时候，很难想象这是出于董保存之手。这部小说描写了一个革命队伍的“逃兵”一辈子心灵上的重负和悲剧性的命运，是很有新意的。后来读到的一连串的作品：《梦，绿色的》、《蒙哥马利在中国》、《杨余傅事件真相》……大多是以历史为题材的。即将问世的长篇纪实文学《八月悲剧》，描写了井冈山时期的八月失败这一重大的悲剧性事件，将那时的毛泽东、朱德、陈毅、王尔琢、林彪等人活生生地刻画出来，不粉饰，也不编造，力争做到“求实存真”，凡是读到这部作品的人，都感到“不小的震动”。还有一部以红军时期肃反运动、打ＡＢ团为背景的长篇纪实文学；一部反映谭震林将军“文革”前后生活遭遇的报告文学《仗义执言者》，都将脱稿问世。加上长篇小说《灯火阑珊时》，《他们的对手是女性》，中短篇小说集《只有四个人》、《前面是血红的灯》，他已经出版了五本书。
    董保存对于中国革命历史的兴趣，至少可以追溯到十年前，他在帮助莫文骅同志撰写回忆录《解放北平前后》的时候，展现在一个２５岁的青年军人面前的，是这样一个闻所未闻的无比丰富多采的富矿。也许从那时起，他便把自己的文学罗盘定在了这个富矿所在的方位上。接着，肖克、杨得志、杨成武、曾志、曹里怀、欧阳毅、傅崇碧……一个又一个功勋卓著而又饱经磨难的革命前辈的命运经历进入了他的视野。他发现了这支以中国农民为主体的革命军队的命运所系的奥秘，不仅看到先辈们辉煌业绩的动力的源泉，也看到了革命过程中的污秽和悲剧，进而给他带来深重的困惑。这更加深了他开掘这个富矿的吸引力。于是，他不仅埋头于丰富的革命史料之中，而且利用一切机会采访老一辈革命家，几乎走遍大半个中国，进行实地的考察、采风、寻访……越是深入地潜入革命历史的内蕴深处，他越是感到把前辈的宝贵遗产留给后人的价值。他不止一次地说起，他当战士时参加拆毁宁武县古老城墙——摧毁古老文物却浑然不觉，今天意识到当时行为的愚蠢，但文物却已不复存在，问题是应该尽力避免此类的愚行再次发生，每一个作家都有责任这样做。
    虽然是写历史，多年的军旅生涯的锻造，还是给了他莫大的帮助，他不仅懂得了在责任感驱使之下坚韧探索的必要，而且懂得秉笔直书“历史真实”可能承担的风险和代价，战争和军事方面的知识也无疑使他避免了许多年轻人写历史容易出现的误解和疏漏，更不用说，没有对军队内部生活的熟悉和了解，根本无法勾画出我军高级将领真实的形象和灵魂。而有些作品，如长篇小说《灯火阑珊时》，则是以转业军人为主人公，充满了对当代改革开放生活韵律的熟悉和了解。任何人观照历史的最根本的参照都无疑是现实，所以克罗齐说“一切历史都是当代史”。而董保存显然是从对当代历史的认识和军旅生活的经历这两个支点上，获得了重新审视革命历史的最佳角度。
