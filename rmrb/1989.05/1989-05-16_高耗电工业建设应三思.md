Currently, the power supply in Shanxi Province is extremely tight. Under these circumstances, some units in Linfen are still planning to build high-energy-consuming industries such as ferro-silicon and calcium carbide. Relevant departments hope that the decision-making authorities will think carefully before proceeding.

Recently, the "Linfen Economic Information" published intended projects for introducing funds, including: a certain county's ferroalloy plant plans to introduce 50 million yuan of funds to produce 1,300 tons of calcium-silicon alloy annually; a certain county's chemical plant plans to introduce 90 million yuan of funds to produce 5,000 tons of calcium carbide annually; a certain city and county's ferro-silicon plants plan to introduce 114.8 million yuan and 60 million yuan of funds respectively, each building a plant to produce 5,000 tons of ferro-silicon annually.

The ferro-silicon and calcium carbide industries consume a large amount of electricity, with approximately 10,000 kilowatt-hours required to produce one ton. In the past two years, Linfen has successively built nearly 20 ferro-silicon, calcium carbide, and industrial silicon plants. Some of these high-energy-consuming industrial projects have just started production but are already in trouble due to power shortages; some are still under construction and find it difficult to withdraw. A certain county introduced 8 million yuan of funds to build an industrial silicon plant, which started production in October 1988 but only operated for 12 days before shutting down due to lack of power. Now, with the repayment period for the introduced funds approaching, the factory director is anxious. Another ferro-silicon plant jointly operated by this county and a Hong Kong businessman is scheduled to be completed in June this year. If these two plants operate simultaneously, the county's industrial and agricultural production and people's living electricity will almost have to be stopped.

### 高耗电工业建设应三思

　　高耗电工业建设应三思
    目前，山西电力十分紧张。在这样的情况下，临汾地区的一些单位仍在打算建设硅铁、电石等高耗电工业，有关方面希望决策部门三思而行。
    近期的《临汾经济信息》刊登意向引进资金的建设项目有：某县铁合金厂引进资金５００万元，计划年产硅钙合金１３００吨；某县化工厂引进资金９００万元，计划年产电石５０００吨；某市和某县硅铁厂分别引进资金１１４８万元和６００万元，各建一座年产５０００吨硅铁厂。
    硅铁、电石工业耗电量大，每生产１吨约需１万度电。临汾地区这两年来相继兴建了近２０座硅铁厂、电石厂和工业硅厂，这些高耗电工业项目，有的刚投产，就因缺电而陷入困境；有的正在建设之中，骑虎难下。某县引进资金８０万元建设的工业硅厂，１９８８年１０月投产后，只生产了１２天，因无电而停产至今，眼看引进资金偿还期快到，厂长心急如焚。这个县与港商联营的另一座硅铁厂，预计今年６月建成。如果这两个厂同时生产，全县的工农业生产和人民生活用电几乎全要停止。
