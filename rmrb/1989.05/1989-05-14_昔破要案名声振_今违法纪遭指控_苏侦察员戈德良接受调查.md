Soviet investigator Gordeyev and others have recently been accused of violating discipline and are currently under investigation.

According to a report by TASS, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR announced on May 13 that Gordeyev and his colleague Ivanov recently made a series of provocative statements on radio and television in Moscow and Leningrad, falsely accusing certain state leaders of illegal activities. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet believes that the purpose of these statements is to confuse public opinion and obstruct the work of the special committee established to investigate their actions.

Gordeyev became famous in the Soviet Union for exposing the major economic cases of corruption and bribery in Uzbekistan and was recently elected as a People's Deputy. However, in recent times, there have been accusations that he abused his power in his work, used improper means to obtain confessions, and seriously violated discipline. To clarify the facts, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has established a special committee for investigation.

　　昔破要案名声振　今违法纪遭指控    
    苏侦察员戈德良接受调查
    新华社莫斯科５月１３日电  苏联检察院侦察员戈德良等人最近被指控违反法纪，目前正在接受调查。
    据塔斯社报道，苏联最高苏维埃主席团１３日在一则公告中说，戈德良及其同事伊万诺夫最近在莫斯科和列宁格勒通过电台和电视台发表了一系列挑衅性讲话，无端指控国家某些领导人有违法行为。最高苏维埃主席团认为，这些讲话的目的是混淆视听，妨碍为调查他们的行为而专门成立的委员会工作。
    戈德良因揭发出震惊全国的乌兹别克特大贪污受贿等经济要案而闻名苏联，并在不久前被选为人民代表。但是，近一个时期有人指控他在工作中滥用职权，用不正当手段获取口供，严重违反法纪。为搞清事实，苏联最高苏维埃主席团已专门成立一个委员会进行调查。
