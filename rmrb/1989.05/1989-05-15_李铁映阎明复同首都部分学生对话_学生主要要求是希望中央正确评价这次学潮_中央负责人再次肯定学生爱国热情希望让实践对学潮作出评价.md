Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15th.

Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and a State Councilor, and Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, held a dialogue with a group of students from universities in Beijing today. They reaffirmed the patriotic fervor and reasonable demands of the students for advancing the democratic process. However, they also reminded the students that the development of events often does not follow people's good intentions. They hoped that everyone would act with high rationality and resolve issues within the framework of democracy and the rule of law.

Following the dialogue between Li Tieying, Yan Mingfu, and some students from universities in Beijing on May 14th, the All-China Students' Federation and the Beijing Students' Federation invited over 50 students from universities in Beijing to have a dialogue with Li Tieying, Yan Mingfu, and other leaders from the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant departments of the Beijing Municipal Government in the Friendship Building this morning. During the nearly three-hour dialogue, some students mainly requested that the Central Government give a correct evaluation of this student movement.

Li Tieying said that the leaders of the Party and the government have affirmed the patriotic fervor and good intentions of the students in many speeches. However, the overall situation is still developing, and some things do not follow people's will. Li Tieying hoped that the students would act with calmness and rationality, allowing practice and time to evaluate this student movement.

Yan Mingfu said that, apart from expressing regret that students did not apply for and obtain permission from the government to march on April 27th and May 4th, he affirmed the mainstream of the student movement. However, he was also concerned about some situations that had arisen. He hoped that the students would prove with their actions that they were rational.

Li Tieying and Yan Mingfu mentioned in the dialogue that many problems raised during this student movement are worth serious reflection. The work of the Party and the government indeed has many areas that need improvement, such as the scientific and democratic decision-making process, the integrity of Party and government leaders, the selection and appointment of officials, and the reform of the news media. These are major issues that need to be addressed urgently. The resolution of these issues requires a process, legislation, the improvement of democracy and the rule of law, the strengthening of social supervision, including media supervision, the increase of transparency in national political life, the improvement of various regulations, and the resolution of issues within the framework of democracy and the rule of law in the process of advancing economic and political reforms.

During the dialogue, Du Daozheng, Director of the Press and Publication Administration, and Wei Jianxing, Minister of the State Supervision Bureau, briefly introduced the drafting of the Press and Publication Law and the investigation of "official profiteering" and other corrupt practices.

Li Tieying, Yan Mingfu, and others also expressed their willingness to have multi-level and multi-channel dialogues with the students through various means to listen to their opinions and suggestions.

Students from Beijing University of Petroleum, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing Foreign Studies University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Institute of Economics, Peking University, Beijing University of Technology, Central University for Nationalities, and China University of Political Science and Law expressed their views during the dialogue.

Also participating in today's dialogue were leaders from relevant departments of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Beijing Municipal Government, including Yuan Mu, He Dongchang, An Chengxin, Sun Wenzhong, and Lu Yucheng.

　　李铁映阎明复同首都部分学生对话    
    学生主要要求是希望中央正确评价这次学潮    
    中央负责人再次肯定学生爱国热情希望让实践对学潮作出评价
    新华社北京５月１５日电  中共中央政治局委员、国务委员李铁映，中共中央书记处书记阎明复今天在同首都部分高校学生对话时，再次肯定广大学生的爱国热情和推进民主进程的合理要求，但同时提醒学生说，事情的发展往往不以人们的善良愿望为转移，希望大家以高度的理智，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。
    继５月１４日李铁映、阎明复与首都高校部分学生座谈对话之后，全国学联、北京市学联今天上午邀请首都高校的５０多位学生同李铁映、阎明复等中共中央、国务院和北京市有关部门的负责人在政协礼堂座谈对话。在将近３个小时的座谈对话中，一些学生提出的主要要求是希望中央对这次学潮作出正确评价。
    李铁映说，党和政府的领导人已在多次讲话中肯定了广大同学的爱国热情和善良愿望。但是目前整个事态还在进一步发展，有些事情不以人们的意志为转移。李铁映希望广大同学用自己冷静、理智的行动，让实践和时间对这次学潮作出评价。
    阎明复说，我除了对学生在４月２７日、５月４日上街游行未向政府申请并得到批准这一点表示遗憾外，对整个学生运动的主流是肯定的，但对这期间出现的一些情况也感到忧虑。现在一些学生正在天安门广场上绝食，已经在一定程度上影响了我们国家的形象。我希望同学们用自己的行动证明自己是有理智的。
    李铁映、阎明复在座谈对话中谈到，这次学潮中提出的许多问题值得很好地反思。党和政府的工作确实有很多地方值得改进，比如决策科学化、民主化问题，党政领导干部廉洁问题，干部的选拔任用问题，新闻改革问题等，都是当前亟待解决的重大问题。这些问题的解决需要有个过程，需要通过立法，健全民主与法制，加强社会监督，包括舆论监督，增加国家政治生活的透明度，完善各种规章制度，在推进经济体制改革、政治体制改革中，在民主与法制的轨道上解决问题。
    座谈对话中，新闻出版署署长杜导正、国家监察部部长尉健行，还先后向学生简要介绍了新闻出版法起草情况和查处“官倒”等腐败现象的有关情况。
    李铁映、阎明复等还表示，愿意同广大同学通过各种方式进行多层次、多渠道的座谈对话，倾听大家的意见和建议。
    北京石油大学、北京航空航天大学、北京外国语学院、北京师范学院、北京农业大学、北京经济学院、北京大学、北京科技大学、中央民族学院、中国政法大学的学生在座谈对话中发表了意见。
    参加今天座谈对话的还有中共中央、国务院和北京市有关部门负责人袁木、何东昌、安成信、孙琬钟、陆宇澄等。
