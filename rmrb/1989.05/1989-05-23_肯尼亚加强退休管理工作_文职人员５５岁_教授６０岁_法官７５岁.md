Kenya Strengthens Retirement Management Work
Civil Servants at 55, Professors at 60, Judges at 75

NAIROBI, May 22 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government recently announced that the Ministry of Personnel will, starting from May, indicate the exact age of each civil servant on their monthly pay slips to remind government employees to retire on time when they reach the retirement age.

The retirement age for Kenyan civil servants is set at 55 years. Judges retire at 75, and professors at 60. The Ministry of Personnel will send letters to each civil servant at the ages of 50 and 53, reminding them of the remaining time they can continue working.

Currently, the Ministry of Personnel has input the birthdates of all 450,000 civil servants nationwide into a computer system. The computer will automatically display the age of each person every month. This new measure aims to strengthen the retirement system and ensure that civil servants retire on time when they reach the retirement age.

Kenya is one of the countries with the fastest-growing population in the world. Its population has increased from 8 million at independence in 1963 to 23 million. The current annual population growth rate is as high as 4%, and it is estimated that the population will exceed 35 million by the end of the century. Due to the rapid population growth, unemployment has been a major social issue. The unemployment rate last year was 18%, and many young and middle-aged people, including university graduates, are unable to find jobs.

　　肯尼亚加强退休管理工作
    文职人员５５岁　教授６０岁　法官７５岁
    新华社内罗毕５月２２日电  （记者黄谨）肯尼亚政府最近宣布，人事部将从５月份起，在每个文职人员的月工资单上，注明其确切年龄，以提醒政府工作人员在到达退休年龄那个月准时退休。
    肯尼亚文职人员退休年龄规定为５５周岁。法官退休年龄为７５岁，教授为６０岁。人事部将从本月起在每个文职人员５０岁和５３岁生日时致函本人，提醒他们还能再继续工作多久。
    目前，人事部已把全国４５万文职人员的出生年月输入电子计算机。计算机将每月自动显示所有人员的年龄。政府这一新作法目的在于强化退休制度，便于文职人员到退休年龄时按时退休。　肯尼亚是世界上人口增长最快的国家之一，其人口已从１９６３年独立时的８００万增至２３００万。目前每年的人口增长率高达４％，预计在本世纪末，人口将超过３５００万。由于人口膨胀过快，失业现象一直是一大社会问题。去年失业率为１８％，很多青壮年，包括大学毕业生，找不到工作。
