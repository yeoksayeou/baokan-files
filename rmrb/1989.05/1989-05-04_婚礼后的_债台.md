    Debt After the Wedding
    Xi'an Institute of Communications  Liu Lixing

    Currently, building a "debt mountain" after a wedding has become a significant issue in society, and it is spreading rapidly. Consider the following statistics:

    According to a survey of 239 newlywed couples in Shanghai, the average cost of marriage in 1988 was approximately 10,660 yuan, with the highest cost reaching 17,000 yuan. Compared to 1987, both the "average" and "highest" amounts increased by more than 40%.

    According to a survey of 282 urban youth marriages in Shaanxi Province, the average cost per couple was 5,870 yuan, an increase of 3,403 yuan compared to the same period in 1984, representing a 1.4-fold increase. The highest marriage cost reached 14,103 yuan. This amount, with less than 30% coming from the couple's own savings, the rest being borne by the family or borrowed from others.

    According to a survey of 20 newlywed households in Lanzhou City, the cost of purchasing household appliances and furniture alone amounted to 144,600 yuan, averaging 7,230 yuan per household. Of this, parents contributed 78,000 yuan, accounting for 53.9% of the total expenditure; the newlyweds contributed 36,000 yuan, accounting for 24.9%; and loans amounted to 30,600 yuan, accounting for 21.2%. The household with the most borrowing reached over 3,000 yuan, while the least borrowed was over 1,000 yuan.

    The marriage costs for young people are astonishing! To prepare for a "decent" wedding, not only do they spend all their parents' savings accumulated over decades, but they also exhaust the family's resources and their lifetime savings. Some even, after exhausting their funds, end up with a high debt burden. Such abnormal high consumption can easily lead to serious social consequences.

    I believe that many newlyweds and couples today still have not escaped the shackles of extravagant weddings, luxury banquets, travel, and high-end consumer goods. From a subjective perspective, perhaps few couples would not willingly unite to pursue happiness. However, after the wedding, with the high debt burden, how much happiness can there be?

　　婚礼后的“债台”
    西安通讯学院  刘立祥
    时下，婚礼之后筑“债台”已成社会机体一大赘瘤，而且还有迅速扩散之势。请看几组数字：
    据对上海２３９对新婚青年的调查，１９８８年平均每对青年结婚费额约为１０６６０元，其中最高额达１７０００元，与１９８７年相比，“平均额”和“最高额”都上升４０％以上。
    据对陕西省２８２对城镇青年结婚费用的调查，平均每对青年结婚费用为５８７０元，比１９８４年同期增加了３４０３元，增长１．４倍；结婚费用最高达１４１０３元。这笔费用，结婚者自积资金不足３０％，其余则靠家庭承担或向他人借贷。
    据对兰州市２０对新婚夫妇家庭的调查，仅购置家用电器，家具花费１４．４６万元，平均每户７２３０元。其中父母垫支７．８万元，占总支出的５３．９％；新婚夫妇积蓄３．６万元，占２４．９％；借款３．０６万元，２１．２％。借款最多的家庭达３０００多元，最少也有１０００多元。
    青年人的结婚费用太惊人了！为筹备一个“像样”的婚礼，不仅要花光父母几十年积蓄，倾阖家之所有，竭平生之所积，有的甚至在囊空如洗之后又债台高筑。这样的畸型高消费，弄不好还会引出严重的社会后果来。
    我觉得，如今不少新婚夫妇和恋人，仍然没有摆脱绳索捆绑之苦，他们没有受缚于人，倒是用一种无形的绳索把自己捆在奢侈的婚宴、旅游和高档消费品上。从主观愿望而言，恐怕很少有哪一对夫妇不为谋求幸福才自愿结合。然而，婚礼之后，高筑“债台”，还有多少幸福可言呢？
