Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, May 14th.

Approximately 20 million Argentine voters went to the polls on May 14th to participate in the general elections held every six years, selecting the country's leadership for the 1989-1995 term.

This election will produce 600 electors for the president and vice president, 127 national deputies, 101 provincial senators, and 269 provincial deputies. Argentina deployed 70,000 military and security personnel to maintain order.

There are 7 candidates vying for the presidency, with the most promising being Carlos Menem of the People's Unity and Justice Front (an electoral alliance led by the Justice Party) and Eduardo Angeloz of the ruling Radical Civic Union.

Argentina's presidential election follows an indirect election system. Today's voters will elect electors who will then vote for the president and vice president on August 10th. During this period, the parties will also compete within the electoral college. If no clear winner emerges from the electoral college, the decision will be made by the legislature.

Today's election is taking place amidst Argentina's severe economic difficulties. While there are many complaints about rising prices, high fiscal deficits, and stagnant production, there is a consensus that this election holds significant political importance. It marks the continuation of Argentina's democratic process after six years of turmoil.

　　阿根廷举行大选    
    首先产生选举人　八月选举总统副总统
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯５月１４日电（记者可大安）约２０００万阿根廷选民１４日涌向各投票站，参加６年一度的大选，选举１９８９—１９９５年的国家领导人。
    这次选举将产生６００名选举总统和副总统的选举人，１２７名全国众议员，１０１名省参议员和２６９名省众议员。阿根廷出动了７万名军人和保安人员负责维持秩序。
    参加竞选总统的共有７名候选人，其中希望较大的是人民团结正义阵线（以正义党为主体的选举联盟）的卡洛斯·梅内姆和执政党激进公民联盟的爱德华多·安赫洛斯。
    阿根廷总统选举实行间接选举制，今天选民投票产生的选举人将于８月１０日选举总统和副总统。在这期间，各政党在选举人团中还将有一番较量。如选举人团中仍决不出胜负，将由议会来决定。
    今天的大选是在阿根廷面临严重经济困难的时刻进行的。人们对物价全面上涨、财政赤字过高、生产上不去等现象尽管抱怨很多，但一致肯定这次大选政治意义重大，因为它标志着阿根廷的民主进程经过６年的风风雨雨终于得以延续下去。
