We have recently discovered that some individuals or units along the roads have blatantly violated national regulations and infringed upon road property and rights.

	They arbitrarily dig up soil, damaging the road base and shoulders. For example, along the Xuzhou-Huaiyin Road, many sections of the road shoulders have been dug up by local farmers for building houses, making bricks, or leveling foundations. The road shoulders on both sides are riddled with holes, and some road surfaces have collapsed or cracked, affecting traffic safety.

	They illegally build sheds and houses, set up stalls, and obstruct traffic. Along the Xuzhou-Feng Road from Suzhou Mountain Head to Zhengji Garden, a 20-plus-kilometer stretch, there are more than 10 markets that block the road, making it impassable. Vendors at the Liguo Road agricultural market cross the guardrails and set up stalls in the middle of the road; cars often take two hours to pass through the market at Pichang Road. Along the Xuzhou-Huaiyin Road from Wangji to Suining, some farmers have filled in the roadside ditches, built sheds, and constructed restaurants, threatening traffic safety. In January, the provincial government ordered the removal of these structures, but the local government has not implemented the order. Illegal constructions that occupy road property or land continue to occur. A family surnamed Bai built a restaurant on the Xuzhou-Huaiyin Road at Ershankou. When the road administration officials from Tongshan Road Management Station tried to stop them, they were tied up and taken to Yunlong Mountain, where they were beaten and verbally abused.

	They indiscriminately cut down roadside trees. Last winter, farmers along the Fenggu Road cut down nearly all the 10-year-old poplar trees along a 28-kilometer stretch. Nowadays, during the autumn and winter seasons, some people in rural Xuzhou cut down roadside trees indiscriminately.

	They dump garbage and construction materials on the roads. A 30-meter section of the Textile West Road is filled with garbage. There are eight or nine places on the Hubei Road that have become drying grounds for manure. The Lake East Road, which was renovated by the traffic department in May last year, is now also filled with garbage, making it difficult for cars to pass.

	They damage road management facilities. The Xuzhou-Feng Road, which was completed and opened to traffic during last year's National Day, has had nearly 100 hundred-foot markers and more than 30 safety markers stolen in just half a year; road signs and markers have been either knocked over or pulled out and thrown to the side of the road; some roadside drainage ditches have been filled in, preventing rainwater from draining away, which erodes the road base, damages the road, and affects traffic safety.

	We hope that relevant departments will take measures to stop the infringement of road property and rights and the destruction of roads, and ensure the implementation of national road management regulations.

### 徐州公路人为毁坏严重

　　徐州公路人为毁坏严重
    我们最近发现，公路沿线一些个人或单位无视国家法规，肆意侵犯路产、路权。
    随意挖掘取土，毁坏公路路基路肩。如徐（州）淮（阴）公路不少地段路肩的土被沿线的农民挖去建房、制坯、垫宅基；公路两侧的路肩已千疮百孔，一些路面已出现塌陷、断裂，影响行车安全。
    违章搭棚建房，乱设摊点，阻碍交通。徐丰公路从苏山头到郑集园盘道２０多公里的路面上，竟有１０多个贸易市场，将公路堵得无法通行。利国公路农贸市场的小贩跨越护栏，在路中心摆摊；汽车经过邳苍路集市，常常要走两个小时。徐淮公路王集到睢宁段路边沟被一些农民填上，搭棚盖房建饭馆，威胁交通安全。今年１月，省政府命令拆除，但当地政府未付诸实施，侵占公路或公路用地违章建筑的事情仍不断发生。徐淮公路两山口一家姓白的人家在公路上盖饭馆，铜山公路管理站路政人员依法阻止，竟被绑到云龙山，遭到围打谩骂。
    滥砍滥伐行道树。去年冬季，丰谷路沿线农民将２８公里路段上几百棵已有１０年树龄的白杨树砍伐殆尽。现在，每到秋、冬季节，徐州农村公路上，都有一些人滥砍滥伐路旁树木。
    在公路上乱堆乱放垃圾、建筑材料。纺织西路上有３０米路段上堆满垃圾，湖北路上有八九处成了晒粪场，湖东路去年５月交通部门投资改建后，现在也已经被垃圾挤得汽车都难以通行了。
    破坏路政设施。去年国庆节才竣工通车的徐丰公路，半年时间已有近百个百尺桩和３０多个安全桩被盗；沿途路标、路牌有的被推倒，有的被拔出扔在公路边；路边排水沟有的被填堵，使雨水不能及时排走，浸蚀路基，损坏公路，影响交通安全。
    希望有关部门采取措施，制止侵犯路产、路权，毁坏公路的现象，保证国家公路管理法规的实施。
