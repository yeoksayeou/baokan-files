Xinhua News Agency, London, May 21st.

Over the past three years, there have been serious incidents in Anglo-Soviet relations. The British Broadcasting Corporation reported today that the day before yesterday, Britain expelled eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists. The reason given was that they were engaged in espionage activities inconsistent with their official roles. However, this incident was not made public at the time.

The report stated that although Soviet leader Gorbachev recently visited Britain, leading to unprecedented improvements in Soviet-British relations, the British government remains seriously concerned about Soviet espionage activities targeting British economic interests.

It is believed that this is one of the most serious incidents in Soviet-British relations over the past three years.

Today, the Soviet Union responded by expelling an equal number of British diplomats and journalists for the same reason.

Among the three expelled British journalists, one is BBC reporter Jeremy Harris. Currently, the BBC is negotiating with the Soviet ambassador to Britain and has stated that it will resist this expulsion.

　　三年来英苏关系的严重事件
    英苏互逐对方人员
    本报伦敦５月２１日电  记者陈特安报道：据英国广播公司今天报道，前天英国驱逐８名苏联外交官和３名新闻记者，其理由是，他们从事与他们的身份不相符合的间谍活动。但此事当时未公诸于众。
    报道说，尽管前不久戈尔巴乔夫访英，苏英两国关系得到前所未有的改善，但英国政府仍对苏联驻英机构针对英国经济目标的间谍活动表示严重关切。
    据认为，这是三年来英苏两国关系中的一个严重事件。
    今天，苏联对此作出反应，也以同样的理由驱逐英国同样数目的外交官和记者。
    在被驱逐的三名英国新闻记者中，有一位是英国广播公司记者杰里米·哈里斯。眼下，英广播公司正在同苏驻英大使交涉并说将抵制这种驱逐。
