China and Iran are not only great civilizations in Asia but also in the world. To this day, the friendly exchanges between China and Iran have a history of more than two thousand years. Following the "Silk Road" and "Porcelain Road" that have long connected China with the countries of the Middle East, the stories of friendship between China and Iran can be described as "endless."

As early as 119 BC, Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty organized a large expedition of 300 people, equipped with fine horses, cattle, sheep, gold, silk, and goods, and sent Zhang Qian as the leader to the Western Regions. When they reached the Ussun Kingdom, Zhang Qian sent his deputy to visit the Parthian Empire (Iran) and other countries. When the Han Dynasty's deputy envoy arrived in Parthia, the Parthian king ordered 20,000 cavalry to rush to the eastern border to welcome them, and the ceremony was very grand. After that, the Parthian king also sent envoys to visit the Han Dynasty. With continuous friendly exchanges, Han culture began to spread in the Western Regions, and the "Silk Road," a bridge for trade between China and countries like Iran, was fully opened. Along the "Silk Road" to the west, there were two routes: one along the northern foothills of the Kunlun Mountains to Yutian, known as the Southern Route; the other along the southern foothills of the Tian Mountains to Shule, known as the Northern Route. There were also two routes from Hami and Shule to the west. The expansion of these major transportation routes between China and the West opened a new era for economic and cultural exchanges between China and the West. Products from Iran and other regions, such as horses, alfalfa, grapes, walnuts, beans, pomegranates, and other plants, were introduced to China. At the same time, the imperial music of the Han Dynasty also absorbed and integrated Western Region's music to be used as court martial music. Meanwhile, China's silk, porcelain, and technologies such as well-digging, iron smelting, lacquer-making, and silk-reeling were also introduced to Iran and other Western Region countries.

By the Eastern Han Dynasty, Sino-Iranian friendly exchanges had further developed. The Eastern Han Dynasty's deputy envoy Gan Ying visited Parthia. The son of King Vologases IV of Parthia, An Shigao, also visited China and worked here for many years. The Sassanid Dynasty of Iran sent more than ten missions to visit China, with some delegations numbering in the hundreds. During the Tang Dynasty, Sino-Western communications reached their peak, and envoys coming in and out of Chang'an became more frequent. Liu Zongyuan said, "All the gatherings of the myriad countries, the coming of the barbarians, and the roads of the world, all originate from within the capital." During the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty, Persian (Iranian) envoys came to court and presented living snakes that could enter burrows to catch mice. During the Kaiyuan and Tianbao periods, envoys were sent to the Tang Dynasty more than ten times, bringing Persian goods. During the reign of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty, the Sassanid Dynasty of Persia collapsed, and Prince Peroz brought his followers to the friendly country of the Tang Empire seeking refuge. Peroz died in Chang'an, and his son Narses also plotted to restore the country in Chang'an. Narses returned to his country to restore it but failed and returned to China during the Jinglong period of Emperor Zhongzong of the Tang Dynasty. He later also died in Chang'an. Wei Shu's "New Records of the Two Capitals" mentioned that Peroz had petitioned to build a Persian Temple in Chang'an. When Narses returned to his country from Chang'an, his entourage numbered in the thousands, which shows the number of Iranians in the Tang Dynasty at that time. Many of these Iranians in the Tang Dynasty became generals, diplomats, astronomers, doctors, and scholars. The friendly exchanges between China and Iran not only deepened the political ties and economic mutual benefits between the two countries but also promoted the mutual penetration of Chinese and Western cultures. During the Kaiyuan and Tianbao periods, Western Region music and dance from Persia and other countries were popular in Chang'an. Yuan Zhen's poem "The Law of Music" says, "Women learn the makeup of barbarians, and performers learn the music of barbarians. The music, cavalry, and makeup of barbarians have been competing for fifty years."

During the Song Dynasty, the overland "Silk Road" was interrupted several times due to wars. However, on the other hand, the development of shipbuilding and the use of the compass opened the maritime "Porcelain Road," becoming a new way for China to increase its ties with the Western Regions and South Asia. Many Iranians came to Guangzhou, Quanzhou, Yangzhou, and other places via sea routes to do business and settle down. The relationship between the Yuan Dynasty and Iran was also very close. Historians of the two countries, Rashid and Boloji, jointly compiled the historical book "Jami' al-Tawarikh." During the Ming Dynasty, during the reign of Emperor Chengzu, a large delegation of more than 300 people was sent to visit Persia. The prince of Shahru of Persia also led a delegation of 500 people to visit China. During Zheng He's voyages to the Western Seas, he also passed through southern Persia many times. In 1516 AD, the Iranian traveler Ali Akbar visited China and wrote the book "Travels in China," which has become a precious historical record of Sino-Iranian friendly exchanges.

From ancient times to the present, China and Iran have always maintained good relations. Since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Iran in 1971, the relationship between the two countries has developed smoothly. In 1979, after the establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Chinese government immediately announced its recognition. In the past ten years, with the mutual visits of leaders from China and Iran, cooperation in economics, trade, science and technology, and other fields between China and Iran has been continuously expanded and strengthened. This visit by Iranian President Khamenei will certainly add a new chapter to the long history of Sino-Iranian friendship.

　　中国伊朗友好史话
    朱梦魁
    中国和伊朗不仅是亚洲也是世界的两个伟大的文明古国。至今，中伊两国的友好交往已有两千多年的历史。循着中国与西亚诸国长期沟通的“丝绸之路”与“陶瓷之路”的轨迹，中国与伊朗的友谊佳话可谓“史不绝书”。
    远在公元前１１９年，汉武帝组织了一个由３００人组成的大探险队，备良马、牛羊、金帛、货物等，令张骞为首出使西域。行至乌孙国，张骞分遣副使出访安息（伊朗）等国。西汉副使节抵安息时，安息国王命令２万骑兵驰奔东部边界迎候，礼仪非常隆重。此后，安息国王也派使节来汉回访。随着不断友好来往，汉文化开始在西域传播，中国与伊朗等国的通商桥梁——“丝绸之路”也随之全面开通。沿“丝路”西行分两道：一缘昆仑山北麓至于阗，称南道；一缘天山南麓至疏勒，称北道。另有从哈密和疏勒西去各分两道。这些中西交通干线的拓展，为中外经济文化交流开辟了一个新纪元。伊朗等地物产如家畜汗血马，植物有苜蓿、葡萄、胡桃、蚕豆、石榴等传入中国，同时汉宫廷的乐府也吸收融汇了西域的胡曲用作朝廷武乐。同时，中国的丝绸、瓷器以及凿井、炼铁、制漆、缫丝等工艺也传入伊朗等西域诸国。
    及至东汉，中伊友好交往有了进一步发展。东汉副使甘英曾访问安息。安息国王满屈的王子安世高也曾来华访问，并在中国工作多年。伊朗萨珊王朝曾十多次派出使团来华访问，其中有的代表团规模有几百人之众。唐代，中西交通进入鼎盛时期，出入长安的使臣更加频繁。柳宗元说：“凡万国之会，四夷之来，天下之道涂，毕出于邦畿之内。”唐贞观年间，波斯（伊朗）使臣来朝，“献活褥虵（同蛇）”，能入穴取鼠。开元天宝年间，前后遣使来唐十余次，带来波斯方物。唐高宗时，波斯萨珊王朝破败，王子卑路斯携部到友邦唐帝国以求庇护。卑路斯在长安客死，其子尼列斯又在长安谋策复国。尼列斯回国图恢复未成，于唐中宗景龙年间返华，后来也客死在长安。韦述《两京新记》说，卑路斯曾奏请在长安建波斯寺。尼列斯自长安回国时所部多达数千人，由此可见当时在唐的伊朗人之众。其中许多在唐的伊朗人当上了将军、外交官员，有的成了天文学家、医学家和学者。中伊之间的友好交往，不仅加深了两国的政治联系与经济互惠，也促进了中西文化的相互渗透。开元天宝年间，来自波斯等国的西域乐舞盛行于长安。元稹《法曲》诗说，“女为胡妇学胡妆，伎进胡音学胡乐。”“胡音胡骑与胡妆，五十年来竞相泊。”
    宋朝年间，陆上的“丝绸之路”曾因战乱几度中断。但另一方面，造船业的发达与罗盘针的运用又开通了海上“陶瓷之路”，成为中国与西域和南亚增进联系的新途径。许多伊朗人经由海路来到广州、泉州、扬州等地经商和安家落户。元朝与伊朗的关系也极密切。两国史学家拉希德和波罗吉相合编史书《史集》。明代，明成祖时曾派出过３００多人的庞大代表团访问波斯。波斯沙哈鲁的王子也曾率５００人代表团来华。郑和下西洋时，也曾多次途经波斯南部。公元１５１６年，伊朗旅行家阿里·阿克巴尔访问中国，并写了《中国纪行》一书，成为中伊友好交往的珍贵的史料。
    从古至今，中伊两国一直和睦相处。自１９７１年中伊正式建交以来，两国关系顺利发展。１９７９年伊朗伊斯兰共和国成立，中国政府即宣布承认。近１０年来，随着中伊两国领导人的互访，中伊之间的经济、贸易、科技等多方面合作不断扩大和加强。此次伊朗总统哈梅内伊的来访，必将为源远流长的中伊友谊史册写下新的篇章。
