Li Peng and other leaders met with representatives of hunger-striking students in Tiananmen Square. Li Peng suggested that the hunger-striking students be quickly and safely sent to hospitals. The student representatives insisted on affirming the current student movement and holding an early public dialogue.

Li Peng and other leading comrades met with representatives of the hunger-striking students in Tiananmen Square from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM today in the Great Hall of the People.

Li Peng said, "I am very happy to meet with you all. Today, we will only discuss one topic: how to relieve the current plight of the hunger strikers. The Party and the government are very concerned about this matter and are deeply troubled. We are worried about the health of these students. First, let's solve this problem, and then we can discuss anything. We are not doing this for any other purpose; we are mainly concerned. You are all young, the oldest being twenty-two or three. My youngest child is older than you all. I have three children, none of whom are involved in 'official profiteering,' but they are all older than you. You are all like our own children, our own flesh and blood."

Brurqihisi, a student from Beijing Normal University: "Li Premier, it seems like time is running out. We should enter into substantive talks as soon as possible. Now, I would like to state our position. You mentioned that we would only discuss one issue, but in reality, it is not you who invited us to discuss; it is the thousands of people on the square who invited you to discuss several issues. Fortunately, our views are consistent. Now, there are already many people on the square, and many have fainted. You probably know the situation. I think the key is how to solve the problem. Yesterday, Comrade Zhao Ziyang's written statement, we have all heard and seen. Why haven't the students gone back yet? We believe that this is still not enough, very insufficient. The conditions we proposed and the current trend on the square, you are aware of."

Wang Dan, a student from Peking University: "I can introduce the situation on the square. Now, more than two thousand people have fainted. To make them leave the scene and stop the hunger strike, we must fully address the conditions we proposed. This issue was also discussed with Minister Yan Mingfu. The government must pay attention to public opinion and solve the problem quickly. Therefore, our opinion is very clear: to make the hunger-striking students leave the scene, the only way is to agree to the two conditions proposed by the students."

Brurqihisi: "You are so old, I can call you Teacher Li. I think that's appropriate. Teacher Li, the problem now is not about convincing us. We really want our fellow students to leave the square. The situation on the square is not about the majority obeying the minority; it is about 99.9% obeying 0.1%—if one hunger-striking student does not leave the square, the other several thousand hunger-striking students on the square will not leave either."

Wang Dan: "Yesterday, we conducted a survey of over 100 students. After Yan Mingfu's speech, we asked whether they agreed to withdraw from the square. The survey results showed that 99.9% of the students voted not to withdraw from the square. Here, let us clarify our demands again: First, affirm that this student movement is a democratic and patriotic movement, not the so-called turmoil. Second, hold a dialogue as soon as possible and broadcast it live on the scene. If the government can quickly and satisfactorily answer these two points, we can go to the scene and persuade the students to withdraw from the square. Otherwise, we will find it difficult to do such work."

Brurqihisi: "Regarding these two points, I would like to explain further. We demand an early rectification and negation of the editorial, that is, first, to positively affirm this student movement, and to negatively negate the 'April 26' editorial, negating that it is turmoil. Up to now, no one has said that the student movement is not turmoil. Also, the nature of this movement should be defined. Then, several methods can be considered: First, invite Comrade Zhao Ziyang or Li Peng, preferably Comrade Zhao Ziyang, to the square to speak directly to the students. Second, the People's Daily can issue an editorial, negate the 'April 26' editorial, apologize to the nation, and acknowledge the great significance of this student movement. Only in this way can we persuade the students to change the hunger strike to a sit-in, and under this condition, continue to solve the problem. We can try to persuade, but we do not dare to say that we can definitely achieve it. But if even this is not possible, then the situation afterwards will be difficult to say. Regarding the dialogue, it should be open, equal, direct, and sincere with the student representatives. This point, the State Council has also said, to have a dialogue, then why can't we propose it this way? Open means to have television broadcasts, this is truly open, and there should also be domestic and foreign journalists present. Regarding equality, it should be leaders with decision-making power, with true, influential student movement representatives, directly elected by the students, this is the meaning of direct and equal. In the dialogue, there should be no more statements like 'I cannot answer such a statement,' 'This is just my personal opinion.' It can also be said this way, if some issues have not been discussed in the Politburo meeting, and we raise them, they should immediately convene a meeting to study, this is the true attitude of solving problems."

Wang Dan: "Now, we representatives came here, actually representing the hunger-striking students on the square, taking responsibility for their lives. Therefore, we hope that the leaders can express their opinions on the two issues we raised. As initiators and organizers, we are all concerned about the safety of our fellow students. I think the leaders will have the same thoughts. Based on these thoughts, we hope to clarify the two issues as soon as possible."

Brurqihisi: "Do other students have any opinions? Please supplement quickly, because we don't have much time."

Xuan Songyu, a student from the China University of Political Science and Law: "Hope to discuss this quickly."

Xiong Yan, a student from Peking University: "We believe that regardless of whether the government or other parties acknowledge it as a patriotic democratic movement, history will acknowledge it. But why is it especially necessary for the government and other parties to acknowledge it? This represents a wish of the people: to see if our government is really our government. The problem is here. Second, we are fighting for communism, we are all people with conscience, people with humanity, to solve such problems, all face and other things should be put down. As long as it is the people's government, admitting its mistakes, the people will support it. Third, we have opinions about Premier Li Peng, not that we have personal opinions about you, we have opinions about you because you are the Premier of the Republic."

Wang Chaohua, a student from the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences: "I agree with a student's statement just now, if a certain resolution is made, but it does not represent the majority of students, it is useless."

Wang Xuezhen, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Peking University: "Many students from Peking University are in Tiananmen Square. As teachers, we are all very sad about the students' actions. I believe that our students are patriotic and hope to promote the reform of China's economic and political systems. The students do not represent turmoil, this point, I hope the government can affirm. Second, I hope the leaders of the government, also hope the General Secretary, can go to Tiananmen Square and talk to the students, on one hand to express understanding of the students' feelings, and on the 'official profiteering' and corruption, our government has already expressed its determination to solve it. At the same time, these problems can be explained to the students, that is, no one says that the students' movement is a turmoil. I hope the government cooperates with the students to persuade the hunger-striking students to go back. This way, it is not good for the students' health. The construction of China, the promotion of democratic politics, all need young people to bear the responsibility."

Wang Zixin, a student from the China University of Political Science and Law: "The slogans of democracy and science have been raised for 70 years, but the goal has not been achieved, now they are raised again. I give the government another sentence, starting from April 22, the petition, the result is that you did not come out, starting from May 13, the hunger strike until now. There is a custom in the world, when the hunger strike reaches 7 days, the government should give a response, even a country like South Africa can do it. Another question, I don't know what the government thinks, now, people joining the parade include kindergarten teachers, etc., all kinds of people."

Wang Chaohua: "I think the students are consciously carrying out a democratic movement, fighting for the rights granted by the constitution, this point, I hope to clarify. If it is only said to be patriotic enthusiasm, then under this enthusiasm, anything can be done. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain the calm, rational, restrained, and orderly nature of this movement."

Wang Dan: "Is there anyone else who wants to speak? If not, then please leaders express your opinions."

Li Peng: "I have one hope, when we speak, do not interrupt. After we finish speaking, if anyone has any opinions, they can speak again, fully."

Shaojiang, a student from Peking University: "The student movement may have already formed a national movement. Students are relatively rational, but we cannot guarantee that the national movement is rational. I would like to ask you to talk about how to handle this situation?"

Li Peng: "You have finished speaking, please let Comrade Li Tieying speak."

Li Tieying: "As the person in charge of the State Education Commission, I have already spoken with Comrade Yan Mingfu and everyone. Regarding the establishment of some dialogue channels with the State Education Commission to listen to the opinions of teachers and students on our work and to criticize our work, this issue, from the State Education Commission, has not established a normal, multi-level, multi-channel form that allows everyone to have a chance to speak, we have not done enough.

This student movement has developed to such a scale, which is something we do not want to see. Because, in fact, it has already formed a very large event across the country, and the problem is some political problems, which have a great response in society, and the situation is still developing. Regarding the views on this student parade and demonstration, I have already expressed them in two dialogues. Generally speaking, students in the movement have shown a patriotic spirit and have put forward many opinions, expressing patriotic wishes. But many things cannot be completely based on our subjective ideas and good wishes, we have to look at the development of the situation and the test of history. Everyone opposes turmoil, we also oppose it, students also oppose it, the people of the whole country also oppose it, hoping for a stable situation. If there is no stable situation in today's China, no stable and united situation, everything is blown away, whether it is economic construction or economic system reform and political system reform. Our wish to revitalize China, without a stable situation, or continue to establish a stable mechanism for long-term governance through reform, without a stable and peaceful international environment, I think the revitalization of the Chinese nation is only a wish, or an empty talk. No matter how many problems and debates we have inside, they should be carried out within the scope of democracy and the rule of law. We have people's representatives, we have the National People's Congress, and various mechanisms. The greatest protection for the students on the square and the students is to hope that we can work together to establish a mechanism that can truly realize the revitalization of China in the process of gradually promoting reform, this is our historical task, this is also the goal that the Thirteenth Party Congress proposed to achieve in the primary stage of socialism. Now the development of things does not completely depend on the subjective wishes and good patriotic enthusiasm of comrades. For example, from yesterday's point of view, 19 cities across the country have had different situations of parades and demonstrations, and some students have come to Beijing from other places. Now, the students on the square are no longer just students from Beijing. Such an order has already not completely adapted to our subjective wishes. To solve some of the problems raised by the students, we have held several dialogues. Now the most important thing is to study how to solve it through democratic and legal means. I hope the students can seriously think about it, so that some of the students present can work, so that the students on the square can return to school as soon as possible."

Yan Mingfu: "In the past few days, I have had many contacts with the students, and now I am only concerned about one issue, which is to save the students on the square who are on a hunger strike, whose physical condition is very weak, and whose lives are seriously threatened. I think the final solution to the problem and the hunger strike should be separated, especially for the students who have not participated in the hunger strike, they should cherish the hunger-striking students. I believe the problem will be finally solved. However, today, we must send some students with very weak physical conditions to the hospital. We should reach an agreement to discuss these two issues separately, because now the situation is developing, just like I said to Brurqihisi and Wang Dan on the evening of May 13, it has already exceeded the benevolent wishes of the initiators, and it is no longer something you can influence. On May 16, I went to the square to exchange views with the students, and I proposed three points: First, please leave immediately, and quickly send the hunger-striking students to the hospital for rescue; Second, I announce on behalf of the Central Committee that we will definitely not 'settle accounts' with the students; Third, if the students do not believe my words, before the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress meets, I can go to the school with the students. It is said that after I left, the students organized a discussion, some students agreed with my opinion, but most students did not agree. In this situation, the Central Committee leaders originally wanted to go to the square to visit the students, but because they did not contact you, they could not go in, this you may know. Now, more and more signs indicate that the three self-generated organizations of the students have an increasingly negative influence on the situation, and now the development of the situation is not proceeding according to your wishes. How the situation will develop, we are very worried. Now the only thing you can influence is to decide the students who started the hunger strike to leave the scene. The Central Committee and the State Council have sincerity and determination to solve the problems raised by the students. Now the important issue that people care about is the lives of the children, and the lives of the children should be highly valued and taken responsibility for."

Chen Xitong: "When I came here, the car could hardly pass, so I was late. As the mayor of Beijing, I would like to say a few words. In the past few days, the development of the situation, the students have all seen, the parade on the square everyone has also seen. Now, many people are concerned about this matter, workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres of government agencies, are all concerned about the current situation. Many workers, peasants, intellectuals, and cadres of government agencies have come to the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, hoping that we can solve the problem according to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's words, on the track of democracy and the rule of law. Everyone knows that now the urban traffic is basically paralyzed, production is greatly affected, some workers in some factories have also come out, expressing support for the students. But the majority of the masses hope that this will not continue, hoping to stabilize. If the entire city's traffic is paralyzed, supplies are cut off, it will have a great impact on our people and our country, this everyone is very clear. They asked me to convey this opinion to the students, now, I have conveyed it.

Now, everyone is very concerned about the hunger-striking students, medical workers, and Red Cross workers are all very concerned about the health of the hunger-striking students, requiring them to provide the greatest convenience, so that the hunger-striking students can be safely sent to the hospital. They put forward to me that political issues are political issues, do not use our children's lives as a joke, or as a bargaining chip. I think this point, I hope the students can understand. Because of the hunger strike, your body has been affected, and even your life has been sacrificed, it is not good for the country and for individuals. As the mayor, I convey these two opinions, hoping that the students can assist more, so that the Red Cross can fulfill their humanitarian duties, ensure the safety of every hunger-striking student. Our municipal government is determined to provide all necessary means, provide rainproof and cold-proof equipment, we have already made full preparations."

Li Ximing: "I have nothing to say, now the primary task is not to have a hunger-striking child's life threatened. We should unite and solve this urgent problem. I hope everyone will work together."

Li Peng: "I would like to express a few opinions. Everyone wants to discuss substantive issues, I will first discuss substantive issues. I suggest that the Chinese and Beijing Red Cross should be responsible for safely sending the students who participated in the hunger strike to various hospitals; I hope that all other students on the square will assist and support this, this is my specific suggestion. At the same time, I require the medical personnel of Beijing and central-affiliated units at all levels to rescue and care for the students who participated in the hunger strike, to ensure their absolute safety. No matter how many common points we have, or how many differences we have, now saving people is the first priority. In this regard, the government is duty-bound and responsible. Every student on the square should also assist from the perspective of caring for their fellow students. My requirement is not to wait until the hunger-striking students are in critical condition before sending them away, but to send them to the hospital now. I have issued instructions requiring major hospitals to do everything possible to vacate beds and necessary medical conditions to receive these hunger-striking students. In the past few days, our medical personnel have also been very hardworking, they have been working day and night, carefully caring for the hunger-striking students. This morning, I and Comrades Zhao Ziyang, Qiao Shi, and Qi Xianwen visited some of the students in the hospital.

Second, whether it is the government or the Central Committee, we have never said that the students are creating turmoil. We have always affirmed that the students' patriotic enthusiasm and wishes are good, many things are done correctly, and many opinions raised are problems that our government hopes to solve. I frankly say, you have played a certain role in solving these problems. Some problems we have always wanted to solve, because there are many obstacles, they have not been solved in time. The students have sharply raised these problems, which can help the government overcome the difficulties on the road to progress. I think this is positive. But the development of the situation does not change with your good wishes, good imagination, and patriotic enthusiasm. In fact, Beijing has already appeared disorderly, and it has spread to the whole country. I have no intention to put this responsibility on the students, absolutely no such intention. Now this situation is an objective existence. I can tell the students that yesterday, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway was blocked for more than three hours in Wuhan, stopping the transportation of the railway artery. Now, there are many idle people in some cities, rushing to Beijing under the banner of students. Beijing has been basically in a state of anarchy in the past few days. I will say it again, I have no intention to put this responsibility on the students. I hope the students think about it, what will be the result if this continues.

The People's Republic of China government is a government responsible to the people of the whole country, we cannot ignore such phenomena. We must protect the lives and safety of the students, protect factories, protect the fruits of socialism, protect our capital. These words, whether you want to hear them or not, I am very happy to have this opportunity to tell everyone. Turmoil, China has had many times, originally many people did not want to create turmoil, but in the end, turmoil occurred.

Third, now there are some staff of government agencies, citizens, workers, and even some staff of the State Council's departments going out to parade, expressing support. I hope you do not misunderstand their intentions, they are concerned about you, hoping that your body will not be harmed. But there are also many people's actions, I do not completely agree with them. If they persuade you to eat something, drink some water, and maintain your health; persuade you to leave the square quickly and have a good talk with the government, this is completely correct. But there are also many people who are encouraging you to continue the hunger strike, I cannot say their intentions, but I do not agree with this. As a premier of the government, I cannot but express my attitude.

Comrades have raised two issues, we understand. As the premier of the government and a Communist Party member, I do not hide my views, but I will not talk about it today, I will talk about this issue at an appropriate opportunity, and I have almost expressed my views. If today, we insist on arguing about this issue, I think it is not appropriate. If you think that the students present cannot control the actions of their comrades, then I will appeal to the hunger-striking students on the square through you, hoping that they will end the hunger strike as soon as possible and go to the hospital for treatment. I once again, on behalf of the Party and the government, express my cordial greetings to them, sincerely hoping that they can accept the government's simple and urgent request for them."

Brurqihisi: "I am very sorry, I just wrote you a note, I would like to remind you that you mentioned arguing about this issue, we students are now only solving this problem from a humanitarian perspective.

There is one more point, now the key to solving the problem is not about persuading us who are present, the problem is how to make them leave. The conditions for their departure have been made very clear, there is only this possibility, this is an objective reality. If one person on the square does not leave and continues the hunger strike, it will be very difficult for the other several thousand people to leave. Regarding the Red Cross solving this problem, I hope Premier Li and the leaders present consider the feasibility of this problem. I will say again what I said just now, let's not argue, this is also our opinion, quickly respond to our conditions, because the students on the square are starving, if this is not possible, and continue to argue about this issue, then we think the government has no intention to solve the problem, we representatives have no need to sit here anymore."

Wang Dan: "If Premier Li thinks it will cause turmoil and have a bad impact on society, I can represent the students to say that the government should take full responsibility."

Xiong Yan: "Dear Comrade Li Peng, you just mentioned a problem, that is, it seems that there are signs of turmoil in society, I want to talk about the relationship between the student movement and turmoil. The student parade has no relationship with turmoil, I hope it can be solved as soon as possible."

Yan Mingfu: "In today's dialogue, everyone's opinions have been put forward to the Central Committee and the State Council. Comrade Li Peng, on behalf of the Central Committee and the State Council, has expressed our views on these issues. Now, the most urgent problem that needs to be solved is how to quickly send the hunger-striking students to the hospital for treatment with the assistance of the Red Cross. Other issues, we all have time to solve. The dialogue ends here."

Wang Zixin: "This is not a dialogue, it is a meeting."

Yan Mingfu: "Yes, it is a meeting."

Some leaders and experts from Beijing's universities also participated in the meeting.

　　李鹏等会见绝食请愿学生代表    
    李鹏建议尽快把绝食同学安全送到各个医院去    
    学生代表坚持要求肯定这次学运尽早公开对话
    新华社北京５月１８日电  国务院总理李鹏等领导同志于今天上午１１时至１２时在人民大会堂会见了在天安门广场绝食请愿的学生代表。
    李鹏同志说，很高兴同大家见面。今天见面只谈一个题目，如何使绝食人员解除目前的困境。党和政府对这件事很关心，也为此事深感不安，担心这些同学的健康。先解决这个问题，以后有什么事都好商量。我们不是出于其它什么目的，主要是关心。你们年龄都不大，最大的二十二、三岁，我最小的孩子也比你们都大。我有三个孩子，没有一个搞“官倒”的，但都比你们年纪大。你们都如同是我们自己的孩子，都是亲骨肉。
    北师大学生吾尔开希：李总理，这样下去，好像时间不够，我们应尽早进入实质性谈话。现在我想把我们的话说一下。您刚才说我们只谈一个问题，而现在的实际情况是，不是您请我们来谈，而是我们广场这么多人请您出来谈，谈几个问题，应该由我们来说。好在，我们的观点是一致的。广场上现在已有许多人，有多少人晕倒了，您大概也清楚。我想重点是如何解决问题。昨天，赵紫阳同志书面谈话，我们都听了，也看了。为什么现在同学们都没有回去呢？我们认为，这还有点不够，很不够，我们提出的条件以及现在广场上的趋势您是知道的。
    北京大学学生王丹：广场上的情况，我可以介绍一下。现在已有两千多人次晕倒。如何能使他们离开现场，停止绝食，必须全面解决我们提出的条件。上次同阎明复部长也谈过这个问题。政府一定要重视民心，尽快解决问题。所以，我们的意见很明确，要使绝食同学离开现场，唯一的办法就是答应同学们提出的两个条件。
    吾尔开希：您这么大年纪，我叫您李老师，我觉得是可以的。李老师，现在的问题并不是在于要说服我们这些人。我们很想让同学们离开广场，广场上现在并不是少数服从多数，而是９９．９％服从０．１％，——如果有一个绝食的同学不离开广场，广场上的其他几千个绝食学生也不会离开。
    王丹：我们昨天对１００多个同学做了一次民意调查，阎明复同志来讲话之后，是不是同意撤离广场。调查结果是９９．９％的同学投票表示不撤离广场。在这里把我们的要求再明确一下：一、肯定这次学生运动是民主爱国运动，而不是所说的动乱；二、尽快对话，并现场直播。这两点如果政府能尽快圆满地回答，我们可以去现场向同学做工作，撤离广场。否则，我们很难做这样的工作。
    吾尔开希：关于这两点，我还想说明一下，我们提出要尽快平反，否定社论，即第一，要求正面肯定这次学生运动，而且要反面地否定“四·二六”社论，否定是动乱。到现在为止，还没有人说学生运动不是动乱。还有，应为这次运动定性。然后，可以想出几种办法：一、请赵紫阳同志或李鹏同志，最好是赵紫阳同志到广场去给同学直接讲话。二、人民日报发个社论，否定“四·二六”社论，向全国人民道歉，承认这次学生运动的伟大意义。只有这样，我们才可以尽量说服同学把绝食改成静坐，然后在这种情况下继续解决问题。我们可以尽量说服，但我们还不敢说一定能够做到。但如果连这一点都不行的话，那后面的情况就很难说了。关于对话，应该是公开、平等、直接、真诚地同广大学生代表对话。这一点，国务院也说过，要对话，那么，我们这样提为什么不可以？公开，就应有电视直播，这也是真正地公开，而且应有中外记者在场。关于平等这一点，应该是由有决策力的领导同志，与真正的、能影响学生运动的、直接由学生选出的代表对话，这才是直接、平等的意思。对话之中，不应再出现诸如这个问题：“我无法回答这样的说法”、“这只是我个人的意见”。也可以这么说，如果有些问题政治局会议未讨论到，而我们提出来了，应该马上再召集会议研究，这才是真正解决问题的态度。
    王丹：现在我们这些代表到这里来，实际是代表广场上绝食的同学，为他们的生命负责而来的。所以希望各位领导能对我们提出的两个问题表态。作为发起者和组织者，我们都为同学的生命安全担心。我想各位领导也会有同样的想法。基于这些想法，希望能对两个问题尽快明确。
    吾尔开希：其他同学还有什么意见，赶快补充，因为我们时间不多。
    中国政法大学学生甄颂育：希望尽快讨论。
    北京大学学生熊焱：我们认为，不管政府方面还是其他方面是否承认它是爱国的民主运动，历史会承认的。但是，为什么还特别需要政府及其他各方面的承认呢？这代表了人民的一种愿望：想看看我们的政府到底是不是自己的政府。其实问题就在这里。第二，我们是为共产主义而奋斗的人，我们都是有良心的人，有人性的人，为了解决这样的问题，什么面子及其它什么东西都应放下来。只要是人民的政府，承认了自己的错误，人民是会拥护的。第三，我们对李鹏总理有意见，并不是对你个人有什么意见，对你有意见，因为你是共和国的总理。
    中国社会科学院研究生院学生王超华：我同意刚才一个同学的说法，如果作出某种决议，但不代表广大同学的话，也是没有用处的。
    北京大学党委书记王学珍：有不少北大同学在天安门广场。对同学们的行动，我们作为师长的，心里都很难过。我认为，我们广大同学是爱国的，是希望推进国家的经济、政治体制改革的。广大同学不是代表动乱，这一点，希望政府能肯定。第二，希望政府的领导人，也希望总书记能到天安门广场，给同学们讲一讲，一方面表示理解同学们的心情，对于“官倒”、腐败现象，我们政府也已多次表示有决心解决。同时可把这些问题向同学们讲一讲，即没有人说广大同学的运动是一场动乱。我希望政府同广大同学配合，劝绝食同学回去。这样下去，对学生身体是不好的。中国的建设，民主政治的推进，都要靠青年人担负。
    中国政法大学学生王志新：民主、科学的口号已提７０年了，但一直未达目的，现在又喊出来了。我再赠给政府一句话，从４月２２日开始了请愿，结果你没有出来，５月１３日开始绝食直到现在。世界上有个惯例，绝食７天的时候，政府应该给予答复，连南非这样的国家都能做到。再一个问题，不知道政府有何想法，现在，加入游行队伍的有幼儿园的阿姨等，各种人都有。
    王超华：我认为，同学们是在自觉地搞一场民主运动，争取宪法赋予的权利，这一点，我希望明确。如果仅仅说是爱国热情，那么在这种热情下，什么事也会干出来的。否则，无法解释这次运动中的冷静、理智、克制、秩序。
    王丹：还有发言的没有？没有了，那么请领导表态。
    李鹏：我提一点希望，当我们讲话时，不要打断。我们讲完后，如果谁还有意见，可以再讲，充分地讲。
    北京大学学生邵江：学生运动可能已经形成一个全民运动。学生是比较理智的，但是我们不能保证全民运动是理智的。我想请你们讲讲，这种事态怎么办？
    李鹏：你们讲完了吧，请铁映同志讲一讲。
    李铁映：我作为国家教委负责人，已经与明复同志一起和大家讲过。关于与国家教委建立一些对话渠道，听取广大教师和学生的意见，对我们的工作提意见，这个问题，从国家教委来讲，没有能够建立一个正常的、多层次、多渠道的形式，能使大家有说话的机会，我们做得不够。
    这次学潮发展到这样的规模，是我们不愿看到的。因为，实际上已经形成了全国范围内很大的一场事件，而且问题是一些政治问题，在社会上产生很大反响，事态还在发展。关于对这次学生游行示威的看法，我在两次对话中已经表示了。广大学生在运动当中，应该说表现了爱国的精神，应该说提出了很多意见，表达了爱国的愿望。但是很多事情并不能完全凭我们主观的想法和良好的愿望，要看事态的发展和历史的检验。大家都是反对动乱的，我们也反对，学生也反对，全国人民也反对，希望有一个稳定的局面。如果在今天的中国，没有一个稳定的局面，没有一个安定团结的局面，什么事情都吹了，不管是经济建设也好，经济体制改革和政治体制改革也好。我们振兴中华的这个愿望，没有一个稳定的局势，或者继续通过改革建立长治久安的稳定的机制，没有一个稳定的和平的国际环境，我看中华民族的振兴只不过是一个愿望，或者说是一句空话。不管我们内部有多少问题的讨论和争论，都应在民主法制的范围内进行。我们有人民代表，我们有人大，还有各种各样的机制。对广场上的学生和广大学生的最大爱护，就是希望我们共同努力，在逐渐推进改革的过程中建立一个能够真正实现振兴中华的这么一个机制，这是我们的历史的任务，这也就是我们十三大提出来的在社会主义初级阶段所要达到的目的。现在事情的发展并不完全取决于同志们的主观愿望和良好的爱国热情。例如从昨天来看，全国已有１９个城市发生了不同情况的游行示威，有一些学生已从其他各地来到北京。现在广场上的那些学生已经不完全都是北京的学生。像这么一种秩序，已经不完全和我们的主观愿望相适应。为解决同学们提出的一些问题，我们已经举行几次对话。现在最主要的问题是来研究如何通过民主和法制的办法来加以解决。希望同学们能够认真思考，使我们在座的一些同学能够工作，使在广场上的同学尽快回到学校去。
    阎明复：这些天来，我和同学们有过多次接触，我现在关心的唯一问题就是要救救在广场上绝食、体质非常虚弱、生命受到严重威胁的孩子们。我想，问题的最终解决和绝食要分开，特别是没有参加绝食的同学，要爱护绝食的同学。我相信问题是会最终解决的。但是，今天就必须把一些身体非常虚弱的同学送到医院里去。我们应该达成一个协议，把这两个问题分开来谈，因为现在事态的发展正像我５月１３日晚和吾尔开希、王丹讲的，已经超出了发起人的善良愿望，已经不是你们能够影响得了的。５月１６日，我到广场上和同学们交换意见，我提出了３点：第一，请你们马上离开，把绝食的同学赶快送到医院去抢救；第二，我代表中央宣布，绝对不会对同学们“秋后算帐”；第三，如果同学们不相信我的话，在人大常委会开会之前，我可以和同学们一起到学校里去。听说我走之后你们同学组织讨论，有些同学同意我的意见，但大部分同学不同意。在这样的情况下，中央领导同志本想到广场上去看望同学们，因为没有与你们联系上，就没有办法进去，这一点你们可能都知道。现在，越来越多的迹象表明，同学们自发产生的３个方面的组织，对局势的影响是越来越差了，现在事态的发展不是按你们的意愿进行的。事态会怎么发展，我们很担心。现在你们唯一可以影响的是，决定绝食的同学离开现场。党中央、国务院有诚意、有决心解决同学们提出的问题。现在人们关心的重要问题是孩子们的生命，对孩子们的生命要高度地重视，对孩子们的生命要负责。
    陈希同：我来这里时，车子已经很难通行，所以晚到了。我作为北京的市长讲几句话，这几天事态的发展，同学们都已经看见了，广场上的游行大家也看见了。现在，许多人很关心这件事，工人、农民、知识分子、机关干部，都关心目前发生的事情。许多工人、农民、知识分子和机关干部到市委、市政府，希望我们能够按照赵紫阳同志讲的，在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。大家知道，现在城市交通基本上瘫痪，生产受到极大的影响，有的工厂的一些工人也出来了，表示支持同学们。但多数群众希望不要再这样继续下去，希望安定下来。如果全城交通瘫痪了，供应中断了，会对我们的人民、我们的国家造成很大的影响，这一点大家是很明白的。他们要我向同学们转达这个意见，现在，我转达了。
    现在，大家对绝食的同学都非常关心，医务工作者、红十字会的工作人员，都十分关心绝食同学的健康，要求给他们以最大的方便条件，能够把绝食的同学顺利地送到医院。他们向我提出来，政治问题是政治问题，不要拿我们孩子的生命开玩笑，或者作为一个什么交换条件。我想，这一点希望同学们能了解。你们因为绝食，身体受到影响了，甚至于牺牲了生命，对国家、对个人都没有好处。我作为市长，就转达这两点意见，希望同学们多多协助，让红十字会能够履行他们的人道主义的义务，保证每个绝食同学的生命安全。我们市政府决心提供一切必要的手段，提供防雨、防寒设备，我们现在已经做了充分的准备。
    李锡铭：我没有什么说的，现在首要的任务是不要有一个绝食的孩子生命受到威胁。要团结一致，先解决这个刻不容缓的问题。希望大家共同努力。
    李鹏：我现在谈几点意见。大家愿意谈实质性问题，我首先谈实质性问题，我建议由中国和北京市的红十字会，负责把参加绝食的同学安全地送到各个医院去；我希望所有在广场上的其他同学予以协助和支持，这就是我的具体建议。同时，我要求北京市的和中央所属单位的各级医务人员，大力地抢救、护理参加绝食的同学们，以保证他们生命的绝对安全。不管我们之间有多少共同点，或者还有什么不同点，现在救人是第一位的。在这方面，政府责无旁贷，有责任。每一个在广场上的同学也应该从关心同学的立场出发，予以协助。我这个要求，不是讲等到绝食的同学在生命垂危的时候再把他们送走，而是现在就把他们送到医院去。我已经发出指示，要求各大医院想一切办法，腾出床位和必要的医疗条件，接待这些绝食的同学。这些天来，我们广大医务人员也是非常辛苦的，他们夜以继日地、精心地护理绝食的同学。今天上午，我和紫阳、乔石、启立等同志看望了在医院的部分同学。
    第二点，无论是政府，还是党中央，从来没有说过，广大同学是在搞动乱。我们一直肯定大家的爱国热情、爱国愿望是好的，有很多事情是做得对的，提的很多意见也是我们政府希望解决的问题。我坦率地讲，你们对于解决这些问题起了一定的推动作用。有些问题我们一直想解决，因为有许多阻力，未能及时解决。同学们很尖锐地提出了这些问题，能够帮助政府克服前进道路上的困难。这一点，我认为是积极的。但是，事态的发展不以你们的善良的愿望、良好的想象和爱国的热情为转移。事实上现在北京已出现秩序混乱，并且波及到全国。我没有把这个责任加给同学们的想法，绝对没有这个意思。现在这个事态，已是客观存在。我可以告诉同学们，昨天京广铁路在武汉一段被堵塞了三个多小时，停止了铁路动脉的运输。现在有不少城市的社会闲杂人员，纷纷打着学生的旗号到北京来了。北京这几天，已经基本上陷入了无政府状态。我再说一遍，绝没有把这个责任加给同学们的意思。我希望同学们想一想，这样下去最后会导致什么样的结果。
    中华人民共和国政府，是对全国人民负责的政府，我们不能对这种现象置之不理。我们要保护广大同学的生命安全，要保护工厂，保护社会主义的成果，保护我们的首都。这些话，你们愿意听也好，不愿意听也好，我很高兴能够有这样一个机会告诉大家。动乱，中国出现过很多次，原来很多人并不想搞动乱，但是最后发生了动乱。
    第三点，现在是有一些机关的工作人员、市民、工人，甚至有我们国务院一些部门的人员上街游行，表示声援。我希望你们不要误解他们的意思，他们出于对你们的关心，是希望你们身体健康不要受到损害。但是这里面也有许多人的作法，我是不完全赞成的。如果他们劝你们吃点东西，喝点水，能够保持身体的健康；劝你们尽快地离开广场，有话好和政府来商量，这完全是正确的。但是，也有不少人是在那里鼓励你们继续绝食，我不能说他们动机怎么样，但是这样做，我是不赞成的。作为一个政府的总理，不能不表明我的态度。
    同志们提出了两个问题，我们是理解的。我作为政府的总理，作为一个共产党员，不隐瞒自己的观点，但是我今天不讲，我会在适当的机会来讲这个问题，而且我也差不多讲了我的观点。如果今天一味要在这个问题上来纠缠，我认为是不合适的。如果你们认为你们自己在座的这些同学，不能够左右你们伙伴们的行动，那我就通过你们向在广场上绝食的同学发出呼吁，希望他们尽快结束绝食，尽快到医院去接受治疗。我再次代表党和政府向他们表示亲切的慰问，衷心希望他们能够接受政府对他们这一很简单、而且很紧迫的要求。
    吾尔开希：非常抱歉，我刚才给您写了一个条子，我现在想提醒您，刚才说纠缠这个问题，我们学生现在只是从人道主义立场上来解决这个问题。
    还有一点，现在解决问题的关键，并不是说服我们在座的这些人，问题是在于怎么让他们离开。他们离开的条件我已经说得很清楚了，只有这一种可能性，这是客观现实。我们广场上如果有一个人不离开，再继续绝食的话，我们就很难保证其他的几千人离开。关于由红十字会解决这个问题，我请李总理和在座的领导同志们考虑一下这个问题的可行性。我现在再说一遍刚才说的话，咱们不要纠缠，这也是我们的意见，迅速答复我们的条件，因为广场上的同学正在挨饿，如果再不行，还在这个问题上纠缠的话，那么我们认为政府毫无解决问题的诚意，我们这些代表没有必要在这里再坐下去了。
    王丹：如果李总理觉得会闹成动乱，对社会造成不良影响的话，我可以代表广大同学说，应由政府来负全责。
    熊焱：亲爱的李鹏同志，刚才您说了一个问题，就是现在好像社会上有动乱的迹象，我要讲学生运动与动乱的关系。学生游行与动乱没有关系，望能及时解决。
    阎明复：在今天这个对话中，大家的意见向党中央、国务院提了出来。李鹏同志代表党中央、国务院表示了我们对这些问题的看法。现在一个最迫切需要解决的问题，是如何尽快地使绝食的同学在红十字会的协助下，到医院里边去进行治疗。其他的问题，我们都有时间来解决。对话就到此结束。
    王志新：这不是对话，而是见面。
    阎明复：对，是见面。
    首都部分高校负责人、专家教授也参加了会见。
