	The reporter, Wu Xinghua, learned from the Ministry of Civil Affairs that the reform of urban welfare undertakings in China over the past five years has resulted in a new pattern of multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-form development of social welfare undertakings.

	By the end of last year, the number of social welfare institutions run by the Ministry of Civil Affairs nationwide had reached 1,098, providing care for 70,000 orphans, elderly, disabled, and mentally ill individuals. Additionally, 8,133 collective welfare institutions run by neighborhoods had provided care for 90,000 orphans, elderly, and disabled individuals.

	The traditional practice of purely providing care in welfare institutions has changed, and a combination of care and rehabilitation has been realized. Nationwide, 40% of the disabled children in care have participated in various rehabilitation training programs, with an effectiveness rate of over 80%.

	Another new development in the reform is that many social welfare institutions, while continuing to provide care for those without dependents or means of livelihood, have introduced fee-based services. By the end of last year, the number of self-funded individuals in urban welfare institutions nationwide had reached over 17,000.

　　全民集体并举　收养康复结合    
    城市福利业出现新格局
    本报湘潭５月８日电  记者吴兴华从民政部正在这里召开的全国城市社会福利事业单位深化改革工作座谈会上了解到：我国城市福利事业改革五年来，出现了多渠道、多层次、多形式兴办社会福利事业的新格局。
    到去年底为止，全国由民政部门举办的社会福利事业单位已达到１０９８所，收养孤老残幼和精神病人７万多人；街道举办的集体福利事业单位达８１３３个，收养孤老残幼９万多。
    福利事业单纯收养的做法已经改变，实现了供养与康复结合。残疾儿童参加各种康复训练的占全国收养残疾儿童总数的４０％，有效率达８０％以上。
    改革中又一新事物是许多社会福利事业单位在做好无依无靠、无生活来源者的收养工作的前提下，实行有偿服务。到去年底，全国城市福利事业单位自费入院人员达１７０００多人。
