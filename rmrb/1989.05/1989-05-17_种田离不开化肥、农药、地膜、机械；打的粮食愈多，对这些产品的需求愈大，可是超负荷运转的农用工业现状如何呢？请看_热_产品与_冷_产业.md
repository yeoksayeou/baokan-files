Farming cannot do without fertilizers, pesticides, plastic film, and machinery; the more grain produced, the greater the demand for these products. However, what is the state of the agricultural industry, which is operating at full capacity? Let's take a look at "hot" products and a "cold" industry.

The products are extremely "hot," but the industry is extremely "cold." This is the current state of China's agricultural industry!

However, history has placed a heavy burden on it: by the year 2000, to ensure that 1.2 billion Chinese people have enough to eat, the annual grain production capacity must increase by 100 million tons compared to now. The production capacity of cotton, oil, and sugar must also increase significantly. To achieve this, the agricultural industry must correspondingly increase the production of large quantities of fertilizers, agricultural film, pesticides, and machinery.

When people turn their attention to the agricultural industry, they cannot help but worry for it:

In recent years, almost every spring there is a shortage of agricultural film, every summer a shortage of fertilizers, and every autumn a shortage of pesticides. The situation of agricultural machinery operating beyond its service life is also worrying.

What factors are hindering the development of the agricultural industry? How can it get out of this predicament?

Micro-profits are difficult to maintain, and relying solely on enterprises to support agriculture may ultimately harm agriculture.

In the era of a planned economy, "supporting agriculture" was a common slogan and action for the entire society. Now it seems to have become the exclusive "patent" of the agricultural industry.

Although the state has allocated a portion of low-priced raw materials to the agricultural industry, the plan is difficult to implement. For example, pesticides, the planned supply only accounts for 70% of the actual demand, and even then, at least half of it cannot be realized. For the agricultural machinery industry, the original supply of steel per 10,000 yuan of output was 1.48 tons, now it has been reduced to 0.33 tons, only 1/3 of the actual demand. The situation with fertilizers and agricultural film is similar. Enterprises have no choice but to go to the market to "find food to eat." However, market raw materials are skyrocketing, and enterprises cannot afford it. Take the coal needed to produce fertilizers as an example; last year, the cost of coal per ton in Jiangxi Province was generally over 100 yuan, now it has risen to over 300 yuan. At the same time, electricity and transportation costs have also increased by nearly 40%. China's agricultural industry has been implementing a "micro-profit maintenance" policy for many years, and the selling price of enterprise products is generally fixed. As a result, many enterprises are losing money the more they produce, and it is better to stop production than to continue. In the first two months of this year, out of more than 1,800 small fertilizer plants nationwide, only 864 were operating, and among the operating plants, 344 were losing money, with a total loss of 8.945 million yuan. Thus, fertilizer production in the first quarter has declined, with a shortfall of 1.15 million tons, and pesticides also have a shortfall of 4,300 tons. If this continues, won't it harm agriculture?

The price of agricultural machinery products has been adjusted downwards 10 times in more than 20 years, with the overall level reduced by more than 40%. Before the reform, relying on state subsidies, enterprises could barely maintain operations; now, times are tough. According to statistics from 1987, among the 10 products of the 6 main factories producing sowing machines, 7 had selling prices lower than the cost, with an average loss of 11.4%. Many enterprises have closed down and been restructured.

Enterprises that have the ability to survive with "micro-profits" are mostly "sick" and struggling. The equipment condition is generally poor, and a considerable number of products need to be updated and replaced.

It is already difficult to maintain production while "sick," and now it is also required to continuously expand production. Taking fertilizers as an example, the demand increases by an average of 5-7% per year. Since the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," the state and local investments in the fertilizer industry have dropped to the lowest point in history, accounting for only 0.94% of the total construction investment. The investment situation during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" is also not optimistic, and it is even more difficult to rely on enterprises to accumulate investment.

The recently published "Decision of the State Council on the Key Points of the Current Industrial Policy" points out that the agricultural industry is both a key industry for supporting production and a key industry for supporting technological transformation, and it is also a key industry for supporting basic construction. How will these three "key supports" be implemented? Currently, there are two possible approaches: one is to take full responsibility for the agricultural industry again; the other is to cancel the "micro-profit maintenance" policy and gradually allow agricultural industry enterprises to operate according to market rules. Considering the actual affordability of farmers, the state can purchase the main products at market prices and then sell them to farmers at a low price.

From an overall perspective, the agricultural industry is "malnourished," and from an internal structure perspective, it has been suffering from deformities for many years. Some parts are too "fat," while others are too "thin."

In 1988, the national fertilizer application amount increased by 7.1% compared to the previous year, but the total grain production decreased by 2.2%. Although there are factors such as natural disasters, another factor that people have not noticed is the serious imbalance in the application ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers. The application ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in developed countries is 1:0.53:0.51, and in developing countries, it has reached 1:0.5:0.24; while in China, it is only 1:0.2:0.02. The soil lacks phosphorus and is even more deficient in potassium, just like a person who only eats grains but not vegetables and meat, the crops will not grow well. As a result, in foreign countries, applying 1 kilogram of standard nitrogen fertilizer can increase grain production by about 5 kilograms, while in China, it only increases by about 2 kilograms.

Agricultural film also has similar problems. Developed countries generally have dozens of varieties, while China only has 3 main varieties. The production structure of agricultural machinery is also worrying. There is a lack of suitable machinery for planting and harvesting crops. The machinery for processing agricultural and sideline products is even more inadequate.

To adjust the internal structure of the agricultural industry, the role of the scientific research team is crucial. However, currently, this team is facing the danger of disbanding. In 1985, there were 38 provincial and municipal-level agricultural machinery research institutions nationwide, now only a few people in 7 institutions are engaged in this work. In provinces like Jilin and Yunnan, the original 400-plus people engaged in the development and research of new agricultural pesticide products have been reduced to around 80. Changing the deformed structure is urgent.

Reality calls for a new system of integrated production, sales, and use.

The disconnect between production, sales, and use is another difficulty hindering the development of the agricultural industry. Currently, the Chemical Industry Bureau is responsible for the production of fertilizers and pesticides, the Light Industry Bureau is responsible for the production of agricultural film, the Agricultural Resources Company is responsible for sales, and the Agricultural Department is responsible for use. Due to the lack of a common interest connection point, the departments often do not serve the farmers' interests but rather divide their own interests.

Every year, these departments have a headache-inducing production plan, with production, sales, and use each calculating their own figures, arguing with each other, and finding it difficult to unify. This year's pesticide production plan has not been unified yet.

It is well known that the production and operation of pesticides and agricultural film have certain risks. Some sudden pest outbreaks can become disasters in just two or three days, and the affected area can be very large. Therefore, enterprises need to prepare a considerable amount of pesticides. However, if the pest outbreak does not occur, the pesticides with a specified effective period will cause trouble for both the manufacturers and the sellers. The production department believes that the sales department should bear this risk, while the sales department believes it is the responsibility of the production department.

The production department and the sales department often argue over unfair profit distribution. The sales department only needs to issue invoices to obtain a profit margin of about 15%, while the production department's profit is meager, and sometimes they even incur losses. Moreover, the sales department, driven by profits, is unwilling to store products during the off-season, and the "reservoir" function is not well played, making it difficult for enterprises to achieve balanced production and exacerbating the contradiction between production and demand. In the first three months of this year, the country produced a total of 160,000 tons of agricultural film, but only 38,000 tons were sold. Factories are complaining, and many regions' farmers are in urgent need of agricultural film but have nowhere to buy it.

The Agricultural Department is nominally responsible for the use of products, but in reality, their words do not carry weight, often resulting in "empty talk." In 1986, the plant protection department of Xiangyang City, Hunan Province, repeatedly issued warnings that the entire county's early rice might suffer from a large-scale rice blast disease, and emphasized that the ineffective "rice blast cleaner" from the county's Agricultural Resources Company should not be used, and "Fuji No. 1" should be used instead. Later, the rice blast disease did occur, but the Agricultural Resources Department insisted on selling the ineffective "rice blast cleaner," resulting in a reduction of 7.5 million kilograms of early rice.

Changing the situation of disconnect between production, sales, and use is difficult to achieve with just one department coordinating. Some developed countries have established economic entities that closely integrate the production, sales, and use of the agricultural industry, which is a method worth learning from. This not only will accelerate the development of the agricultural industry but also significantly improve the efficiency of the agricultural industry. Of course, under the current situation, we cannot complete this process in one step, but can only proceed step by step, either by first implementing production-sales integration or by first implementing sales-use integration.

It is hoped that the agricultural industry, which has been "cold" for a long time, will also become "hot" like its products—fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural film.

    种田离不开化肥、农药、地膜、机械；打的粮食愈多，对这些产品的需求愈大，可是超负荷运转的农用工业现状如何呢？请看——
    “热”产品与“冷”产业
    陈秋中
    产品极“热”，产业极“冷”。这是我国农用工业的现状！
    但历史却给它压上了一副重担：２０００年，要保证１２亿中国人吃饱吃好，必须使粮食的年生产能力比现在增长１亿吨，棉、油、糖生产能力也都要有较大增长。为此，农用工业必须相应地增产巨量的化肥、农膜、农药、机械。
    当人们把目光投向农用工业时，不禁为它捏了一把汗：
    这几年，几乎年年春闹农膜，夏闹化肥，秋闹农药，农机超期服役的现状也令人担忧。
    是些什么因素困扰农用工业的发展？怎样才能摆脱困境？
    微利保本本难保，单纯的企业支农最终可能误农
    在产品经济时代，“支农”曾是全社会共同的口号和行动，现在似乎变成了农用工业一家的“专利”。
    尽管国家给农用工业安排了一部分平价原材料，但计划很难落实。如农药，计划供应的只占实际需要的７０％，而落实下来至少还得打一半折扣。对农机行业，原来每万元产值供钢材１．４８吨，现在已降至０．３３吨，仅占实际需要的１／３。化肥、农膜的状况也与此相似。企业只好到市场上去“找米下锅”。而市场原材料暴涨不止，企业难以承受。以生产化肥需要的煤为例，去年在江西省吨煤进厂一般只需１００多元，现在已涨到３００多元。同时，电力和运输费用也上涨了差不多４０％。我国农用工业多年实行“微利保本”政策，企业产品售价一般定得较死。结果，不少企业越生产越赔钱，生产不如停产。今年１至２月，全国１８００多个小化肥厂仅有８６４个开工，开工的厂中有３４４家亏损，亏损总额达８９４５万元。于是，首季化肥生产滑坡，欠产１１５万吨，农药也欠产４３００吨。如此下去，岂不误农？
    农机产品价格２０多年中１０次下调，总体水平降低４０％以上。改革前，靠国家兜底，企业勉强维持；现在的日子很难过。据１９８７年统计，在生产播种机的６个主要厂的１０种产品中，售价低于成本的有７种，平均亏损１１．４％。不少企业关停并转。
    有能力“微利保本”生存的企业，大部分是“带”病拚搏。设备状况普遍不佳，而且有相当数量的产品需要更新换代。
    “带病”保产已属不易，现在还要求它们不断扩大生产。以化肥为例，需求量平均每年增长５—７％。“六五”以来，国家和地方对化肥工业的投资降到了历史最低点，仅占基建总投资的０．９４％，“七五”期间的投资也不乐观，而让企业自己积累投资更是无从说起。
    最近公布的《国务院关于当前产业政策要点的决定》指出，农用工业既是重点支持生产的产业，也是重点支持技术改造的产业，同时还是重点支持基本建设的产业。这三个“重点支持”如何落实？目前有两种可供选择的思路：一是重新对农用工业实行大包大揽；一是取消“微利保本”政策，让农用工业企业也逐步按市场规律进行运转。考虑到农民的实际承受力，国家对主要产品可按市场价统一收购，然后挂钩低价卖给农民。
    内部结构失衡，效益受到影响
    从整体上说，农用工业“营养不良”，从内部结构看，多年来，我国农用工业又患有畸形发育的病症。有的部位太“肥”，有的部位又太“瘦”。
    １９８８年，全国化肥施用量比上年增长７．１％，但粮食总产却减产２．２％。减产虽然有自然灾害等方面的原因，但还有一个因素人们没有注意到，就是化肥的氮磷钾施用比例严重失调。氮磷钾施用比例，目前发达国家为１∶０．５３∶０．５１，发展中国家也达到１∶０．５∶０．２４；而我国只有１∶０．２∶０．０２。土壤缺磷，更缺钾，就像人只吃粮食而不吃蔬菜和肉，庄稼当然长不好。结果，在国外施用１公斤标准氮肥可增产粮食５公斤左右，而我国仅增产２公斤左右。
    农膜也存在类似问题。发达国家一般有几十个品种，我国仅有３个主要品种。农用机械的生产结构也同样令人忧虑。作物的栽插和收获缺少适用机械。农副产品的加工机械更是满足不了需要。
    要调整好农用工业内部结构，科研队伍的作用十分重要。但是，目前这支队伍面临溃散的危险。１９８５年，全国有省、市级以上农机研究单位３８个，现在只剩下７个单位的少数人从事这一工作。吉林、云南等７省原有４００多人从事农药新产品开发研究，现已减少到８０人左右。改变畸形结构，刻不容缓。
    现实呼唤产销用一体化的新体制
    产、销、用脱节，是困扰农用工业发展的又一难题。现在是化工部管化肥、农药生产，轻工部管农膜生产，农资公司管销售，农业部门管使用。部门之间，由于没有找到共同利益的连结点，往往不是以农民的利益织网服务，而是以自我利益划圆分割。
    每年这几家都有一次令人头疼的计划排产，产销用三家各打各的算盘，一家一个数，相互扯皮，难以统一。如今年的农药生产计划就至今还没统一。
    众所周知，生产和经营农药、农膜都有一定的风险性。有些突发性的病虫害，两三天就足可以成灾，而且面积很大，因此，企业得准备相当数量的农药。但是，如果虫灾不发生，规定有效期限的农药又会令厂家、销家都发愁。企业认为应由销售部门承担这种风险，销售部门则认为这是企业的事。
    生产部门和销售部门还常为利益分配不公而扯皮。销售部门只是开票，就可获得１５％左右的差率，而生产部门利润低得可怜，甚至亏损。而且，销售部门从效益出发，淡季不愿意储存产品，“蓄水池”的作用发挥得不好，使企业均衡生产发生困难，加剧了生产与需求的矛盾。今年１至３月，全国共生产农膜１６万吨，但仅销售出去３．８万吨。工厂叫苦不迭，许多地区农民急需农膜却无处购买。
    农业部门名义上是管使用产品，实际上说话不灵，往往是“空对空”。１９８６年，湖南湘乡市植保部门多次发出预报，全县早稻可能发生大面积稻瘟病，并且反复强调不能使用县农资公司失效的“稻瘟净”，要改用“富士一号”。后来稻瘟病果真发生了，可农资部门坚持出售失效的“稻瘟净”，结果使早稻减产７５０万公斤。
    改变产销用脱节状况，仅靠一个部门协调，很难奏效。一些发达国家建立农用工业产销用紧密结合的经济实体，倒是一种可资借鉴的办法。这样不仅会加快农用工业的发展，而且会大大提高农用工业的效益。当然，在现有情况下，我们不可能一步完成这个过程，只能分步进行，或先实行产销联合，或先实行销用联合。
    但愿已经长久过“冷”的农用工业，也像它的产品——化肥、农药、农膜一样，迅速“热”起来吧！
