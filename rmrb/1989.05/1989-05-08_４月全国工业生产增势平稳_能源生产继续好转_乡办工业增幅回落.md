Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 8th.

April's national industrial production has shown a steady growth trend. Energy production continues to improve, while the growth rate of township and village enterprises has slowed down.

According to a report from the State Statistical Bureau today, due to the strengthening of production command and dispatch by various regions and departments, and the allocation of additional working capital loans, industrial production in April showed a stable growth trend.

In April, the national industrial output value reached 11.36 billion yuan, an increase of 13.7% compared to the same period last year. The average daily output value was 378.5 million yuan, an increase of 6.3% compared to the previous month. By ownership type, the total industrial output value of state-owned enterprises was 6.98 billion yuan, an increase of 8.6%. The total industrial output value of collective-owned enterprises was 3.9 billion yuan, an increase of 19.7%. Among these, the total industrial output value of township and village enterprises was 1.75 billion yuan, an increase of 25.3%. Compared to previous months, the growth rate has slowed down.

Energy production continues to improve. In April, the national energy production totaled 82.82 million tons, an increase of 7.5% compared to the same period last year, making it the month with the fastest growth this year. Among these, coal production increased by 9%, electricity generation increased by 7.3%, and crude oil and natural gas have reversed the declining trend of previous months, showing month-on-month growth. The improvement in energy production has provided conditions for the overall industrial production, especially the basic materials industry. In April, there was a turnaround in the production of steel, steel products, ferroalloys, 10 types of non-ferrous metals, chemical raw materials, and fertilizers.

The production of traditional light textiles has improved, and the growth rate of high-end consumer goods remains high. In April, textile products such as cloth and silk showed growth, reversing the declining trend at the beginning of the year. Sugar, salt, beer, canned goods, synthetic detergents, and other products grew by 13.6% to 43.4%, while high-end household consumer goods continued to maintain rapid growth. Color TVs grew by 43.2%, and household refrigerators grew by 42.2%.

Relevant experts believe that from the perspective of April's industrial production situation, the growth rate of energy and basic materials industries is still not well-matched with the overall industrial growth.

　　４月全国工业生产增势平稳
    能源生产继续好转
  　乡办工业增幅回落
    本报北京５月８日讯  记者张国荣报道：国家统计局今天发布的工业生产快报表明，４月份，由于各地区、各部门进一步加强了对生产的指挥调度，增拨了部分流动资金贷款，工业生产呈现稳定增长的势头。
    ４月份全国完成工业总产值１１３６亿元，比去年同期增长１３．７％，平均日产值３７．８５亿元，比上月增长６．３％。分类型看，全民所有制工业总产值６９８亿元，增长８．６％，集体所有制工业总产值３９０亿元，增长１９．７％，其中乡办工业总产值１７５亿元，增长２５．３％，与前几个月相比，增幅有所回落。
    能源生产继续好转。４月份，全国能源生产总量为８２８２万吨，比去年同期增长７．５％，是今年以来增长最快的一个月。其中原煤增长９％，发电量增长７．３％，原油、天然气等也扭转了前几个月的下降趋势，比去年月月有所增长。能源生产形势好转，为整个工业，特别是基础材料工业的生产提供了条件。４月份，钢、钢材、铁合金、１０种有色金属、化工原料以及化肥生产出现转机。
    传统轻纺产品生产有所好转，高档消费品增幅仍高。４月份，布、丝等纺织产品有所增长，扭转了年初下降趋势。糖、原盐、啤酒、罐头、合成洗涤剂等增长在１３．６％至４３．４％，而高档家用消费品继续保持较快增长。彩电增长４３．２％，家用电冰箱增长４２．２％。
    有关人士分析认为，从４月份工业生产形势看，能源工业、基础材料工业生产与整个工业的增长速度相比依然很不相适应。
