The Andean Group Summit Signs the Cartagena Declaration
Cooperation Enters a New Stage

		Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, May 27th: Correspondent Zhu Manting reports: The Andean Group Summit held in Cartagena, Colombia concluded yesterday. The summit decided to take clear measures to overcome obstacles and promote the integration process in the Andean region. The leaders of the five countries signed the Cartagena Declaration to strengthen political and economic cooperation among the countries.

		The presidents of Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, and Venezuela, along with the foreign minister of Bolivia, decided in the Declaration to expand the original Andean Pact, which was limited to the economic sphere, to the political sphere. They instructed the foreign ministers to study a political pact that includes peaceful resolution of disputes and the elimination of border tensions between countries.

		The Declaration calls for redoubled efforts in the fight against drug trafficking, supporting Bolivia's proposal to hold an international conference including industrialized drug-consuming countries, and establishing a fund to replace marijuana cultivation.

		In the economic sphere, the Declaration gave clear instructions to the regional integration institutions, which will be implemented in the coming months and assessed at the next summit in October. To revitalize the Andean Pact signed 20 years ago, the summit decided that each country should effectively and promptly eliminate measures that hinder the opening of tariffs and refrain from implementing new unilateral tariff restrictions; redefine the minimum internal tariff rate suitable for current needs; implement the measures in the Quito Agreement to restore the declining trade among member countries in recent years; strengthen the financial institutions of the Andean Pact—the Andean Reserve Fund Commission and the Andean Development Bank—to expand their business scope and use the Andean Peso as the regional currency unit; strengthen the integration process and implement the Andean Plan for the shared use of communication satellites.

		Public opinion believes that this summit reflects the political will of the Andean Group countries to revive the integration process, which will bring cooperation among Andean countries into a new stage.

　　安第斯集团首脑会议签署《卡塔赫纳宣言》
    相互合作进入新阶段
    本报加拉加斯５月２７日电  记者朱满庭报道：在哥伦比亚卡塔赫纳举行的安第斯集团首脑会议昨天闭幕。会议决定采取明确措施克服障碍，推动安第斯地区一体化进程，５国领导人签署了《卡塔赫纳宣言》，以加强各国间的政治经济合作。
    参加会议的哥伦比亚、秘鲁、厄瓜多尔、委内瑞拉４国总统和玻利维亚外长在《宣言》中决定将原限于经济领域的安第斯条约扩大到政治领域，要求各国外长就一项政治条约进行研究。这项政治条约应包括和平解决争端，消除国家间边界紧张局势等内容。
    《宣言》呼吁加倍努力进行反对贩毒的斗争，支持玻利维亚所提出的召开包括消费毒品的工业国参加的国际会议，建立用于取代大麻种植业的一项基金的动议。
    在经济领域内，《宣言》对地区一体化机构作出了明确的指示，这些指示将在今后数月内予以执行，并在１０月份举行的下次首脑会议上对执行成果加以评估。为重新活跃２０年前签订的安第斯条约，会议决定，各国应有效及时的取消有碍于开放关税的各种措施，并不再单方面实行新的关税限制；重新确定适应目前需要的地区内部最低关税率；落实基多协定书中的各项措施，以恢复近年不断下降的各成员国间的贸易；加强安第斯条约组织的金融机构——安第斯储备基金委员会和安第斯发展银行，以扩大其业务范围并把安第斯比索作为地区内部的货币单位；加强一体化进程，落实共用通讯卫星的安第斯计划。
    舆论认为，这次会议体现了安第斯集团各国复兴一体化进程的政治愿望，将使安第斯国家的合作进入一个新阶段。
