	Maintaining Public Order Through Community Involvement
	Sofia's Crime Rate Drops

	Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, has seen a significant reduction in crime rates this year due to the implementation of community-based public order measures. The city's social order has been stabilized as a result.

	Last year, Sofia faced a deteriorating public order situation. Criminal elements engaged in theft, vandalism of public property, disruption of social order, and even murder. This situation drew serious concern from various sectors. The public security departments, in collaboration with various levels of party and government agencies and social organizations, established coordination mechanisms. They divided responsibilities by region and mobilized the entire society, including various institutions, schools, and families, to jointly combat negative phenomena. Relevant departments also utilized newspapers, radio, and television to conduct extensive public order education and propaganda, making various criminal situations public. In particular, television was used to educate minors on-site, with parents and juvenile delinquents appearing together on television to discuss the circumstances of juvenile crime and the responsibilities of parents. Due to the implementation of these measures, the crime rate has decreased, achieving noticeable social effects.

	According to Sofia City Public Security Bureau Director Major General Nikola Marinchev, Sofia's social crime rate in the first quarter of this year decreased by 17.5% compared to the same period last year.

　　依靠群众维持治安    
    索非亚犯罪率下降
    新华社索非亚５月２日电  （记者刘福平）保加利亚首都索非亚今年以来由于采取群众性治安措施，社会秩序稳定，犯罪率明显下降。
    去年，索非亚一度治安情况不好，不法分子偷盗、破坏公共财产、扰乱社会秩序，甚至凶杀案件时有发生。这一情况引起了各界严重关注。公安部门同各级党政机关和社会组织，建立了协调机构，按地区分段负责，动员全社会，包括各机关、学校和家庭共同向不良现象坚决斗争。有关部门还利用报刊、电台和电视台进行广泛的社会治安宣传教育，把各种犯罪情况公布于众。特别是利用电视台对未成年人进行现场教育，家长同犯罪少年一起在电视上露面，讲解少年犯罪情况与家长的责任。由于采取了一系列措施，使犯罪率下降，取得了明显的社会效果。
    据索非亚市公安局长尼古拉·马林切夫少将最近介绍说，索非亚今年第一季度社会犯罪率比去年同期减少了１７．５％。
