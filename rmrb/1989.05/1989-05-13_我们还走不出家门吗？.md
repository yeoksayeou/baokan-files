Title: Can We Still Not Leave Our Homes?

	Once a year, during the home visit, the most noticeable change in the small county town is the construction of new houses, standing tall and proud. Many friends' homes have carpets, and furniture and appliances are updated according to the idea of "today is right, yesterday is wrong." However, the roads in the new residential areas are littered with garbage and foul-smelling water. The old moat where children used to play is now almost a sewer. When I asked how they could tolerate this, a friend casually replied, "It's public property, who cares?"

	Public matters now seem to have no one to take care of. The Chinese have always prioritized private affairs. Public spirit and public morality rarely extend beyond the home. In the past, people would at least "sweep the snow in front of their own doors," but now they don't even bother with that. When I step out from the "civilized" interior and warm human interactions, seeing the dirty, chaotic, and poor conditions of the streets, I can't help but feel nauseated.

	One day, a major newspaper reported that a young boy from Huai'an was injured by a three-wheeled cargo truck on his way home at night. The driver fled, leaving the boy in a pool of blood, calling for help repeatedly, but no one came to his aid until he died. Reading this, my heart aches and tears fall. Is it that even basic sympathy and humanity are absent outside the "home"?

	Some people have become wealthy, but many of them focus on having many children, believing in the saying "many children, many blessings." They are busy building ancestral graves and ancestral halls, unaware that 20% of the country's new national income each year goes into the mouths of new babies, and that arable land is decreasing by 5% each year. Yet, they still ask, "Why is the country so poor?"

	For thousands of years, China has been family-oriented, with national governance merely an extension of family governance. In reality, loving one's family is tangible and sincere, while loving one's country is often vague and scattered. Otherwise, China would not be mocked as "a pile of loose sand."

	70 years ago, Chen Duxiu wrote an essay titled "On the Loss of the Country," in which he listed two main reasons for the country's decline. The first reason was "knowing only the family, not the country." How true these words are! If it weren't for those awakened Chinese people who stepped out of their homes to ask about the country's fate and sacrifice themselves, there would be no later "republic," and there certainly would not be the new China of today.

	We have spent an entire 10 years to make the country strong and to allow some people to get rich first. If the people, from their thoughts to their actions, still cannot step out of the "home," and if society lacks public morality and public spirit, then the future of the country is not optimistic.

### 我们还走不出家门吗？

　　我们还走不出家门吗？
    黄传芳
    一年一度探亲，家乡小县城的最大变化莫过于盖起了幢幢新房，气宇轩昂，许多友人的家里都铺上了地毯，家具、家电更按“今是而昨非”的观念更换着……可新宅区的道路却是垃圾遍地、臭水四溢，昔日孩儿们嬉戏的护城河，已快变成臭水沟了。我问这如何受得了，友人很自然地回答：“公家的，谁管？”
    公家的事，现在的确找不着人管。中国人历来最重的是私家。所谓公益心、公德心极少能跨出家门。过去，“各人自扫门前雪”，于今这“门前雪”都不屑去扫了。当我从室内的“文明”和融融人情中走出，见那街道上的脏、乱、差，真要忍不住呕吐了。
    某日某大报上说一位淮安少年夜里回家，路上被一三轮货车撞倒并轧成重伤，肇事司机逃之夭夭，少年在血泊中一遍遍向路人呼救，围观者竟没有一人相助，直至他最后咽了气……读此，我心酸落泪，难道这起码的恻隐同情心和人道精神在“家门”之外就找不着了吗？
    一部分人先富了，但其中相当多的人想的是人丁兴旺，多子多福，忙的是修祖坟，建祠堂，岂知国家每年的新增国民收入的２０％填在一张张新开的食管里，国有耕地每年以５％的速度递减。反过来，这些人还说：“这国家怎么这么穷？”
    几千年来的中国以家法为本位，国政不过是家政的扩大。但实际上，爱家是实实在在、认认真真，而爱国却往往模模糊糊、稀稀零零。不然中国就不会被讥为“一盘散沙”。
    ７０年前，陈独秀作过一篇《亡国篇》，内举亡国的原因有两条，第一条就赫然写着：“只知道有家，不知道有国。”痛哉斯言！倘没有当时那些觉醒的中国人纷纷走出家门，问国家之兴亡，舍己身之存续，哪有后来的“共和”，更不会有今天的新中国。
    我们用了整整１０年时间，才使国家摆脱赢弱，也才使一部分人先富起来，倘国民从思想到行为依然走不出“家门”，社会缺乏公德公心，那么，国家的前途就不容乐观了……
