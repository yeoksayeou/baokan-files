Afghan Mujahideen Temporary Government Chairman Expresses Hope for Negotiations with the Soviet Union to Resolve the Afghan Issue

	NEW DELHI, May 14 (Xinhua) — According to a report by the Afghan News Agency today, Afghan Mujahideen Temporary Government Chairman Burhanuddin Rabbani (Mujaheddi) said that if the Soviet Union requests it, he is willing to resume negotiations with them to resolve the Afghan issue.

	Rabbani simultaneously denied the possibility of holding talks with the Kabul regime and rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to hold an international conference to resolve the Afghan issue.

	Soviet Ambassador to Afghanistan V. Vorontsov recently proposed that the Mujahideen hold talks with the Kabul regime to resolve the Afghan issue. Soviet Ambassador to Pakistan Kozlov had mentioned the proposal to convene an international conference on the Afghan issue.

	Rabbani said, "The Kabul regime is illegal and does not represent the will of the Afghan people." Regarding the international conference, he said, "We do not know what the purpose of the conference is, or what the topics of discussion will be."

	The Afghan Mujahideen and the Soviet Union had held two rounds of talks before the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan, but no agreement was reached.

　　阿游击队临时政府主席表示    
    希望同苏谈判解决阿问题
    新华社伊斯兰堡５月１４日电  据阿富汗新闻社今天报道，阿富汗游击队临时政府主席穆贾迪迪表示，如果苏联人要求的话，他愿同他们就解决阿富汗问题恢复谈判。
    穆贾迪迪同时否认与喀布尔政权举行谈判的可能性，并拒绝苏联提出的举行国际会议解决阿富汗问题的建议。
    苏联驻阿富汗大使沃龙佐夫最近建议游击队同喀布尔政权举行谈判，以解决阿问题。苏联驻巴基斯坦大使科兹列夫曾提到召开关于阿富汗问题的国际会议的建议。
    穆贾迪迪说，喀布尔政权是非法的，它不代表阿富汗人民的意愿。至于国际会议，他说：“我们不知道会议的目的是什么，辩论的主题是什么。”
    阿富汗游击队与苏联在苏联从阿富汗撤军前曾举行过两次会谈，但未达成任何协议。
