Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 11th.

The reporter learned from the Ministry of Energy that China's coal production has maintained a good momentum in the first four months of this year, despite having already experienced seven consecutive years of growth.

Over the past few years, China's coal production has been steadily developing. From 1983 to 1987, the production increased by over 300 million tons, with an average annual increase of nearly 3500 tons.

In the first four months of this year, despite the tight supply of raw materials and insufficient power supply, a total of 298 million tons of coal were produced, exceeding the target by 1403 million tons and increasing by 6.7% compared to the same period last year.
