Panama's presidential election is imminent. The Democratic Alliance of the Citizen Opposition and the National Liberation Alliance, supported by the government, concluded their election campaigns yesterday and today, respectively, in anticipation of the national referendum on May 7th to elect the president and vice president.

According to news media in Mexico City, the Democratic Alliance of the Citizen Opposition held a grand rally with 200,000 people yesterday to conclude their election campaign. Supporters of the alliance carried coffins bearing Noriega's image, demanding Noriega's resignation and an end to military interference in national politics. The alliance's presidential candidate, Endara, declared that they would defeat the official candidate in the May 7th election, determining General Noriega's fate in a "Chilean manner." Today, the National Liberation Alliance, which supports the government and Noriega, also held a rally with tens of thousands of people, announcing the conclusion of their election campaign. The alliance's presidential candidate, Duque, stated that only their administration could ensure the return of the canal to Panama, truly making it a freely navigable waterway for all nations.

It is reported that former U.S. Presidents Carter and Ford have arrived in Panama leading an international team of observers to monitor the May 7th election. The Panamanian opposition has also invited 200 foreign observers, with 130 already confirmed to attend.

Panama's ambassador to Mexico, Turne, stated that allowing foreign observers to enter Panama to monitor the election demonstrates the Panamanian government's democratic spirit and confidence. However, the U.S. ambassador to Panama, Davis, said that if the Panamanian election is fraudulent, "anything could happen." U.S. diplomatic officials declined to explain whether this includes "military intervention," but confirmed that "economic sanctions will escalate." It is known that the U.S. State Department has long complained about the Pentagon's soft stance on Noriega.

　　巴拿马总统选举在即    
    美两位前总统率观察员抵巴
    本报墨西哥城５月４日电  记者郭伟成报道：巴拿马公民反对派民主联盟与政府支持的民族解放联盟分别在昨天与今天结束竞选活动，迎接５月７日的全国公民投票，竞选总统与副总统。
    据墨西哥城新闻媒介报道，公民反对派民主联盟昨天举行２０万人的盛大集会，结束竞选活动。该联盟的支持者举着带有诺列加形象的棺材示威，要求诺列加下野，结束军队对国家政治的干预。该联盟总统候选人恩达拉声称将在７日大选中击败官方候选人，以“智利方式”决定诺列加将军的前途。今天，政府与诺列加支持的民族解放联盟也举行数十万人集会，宣布结束竞选活动。民族解放联盟的总统候选人杜克声称，只有该联盟执政，才能保证运河回归巴拿马，真正成为世界各国自由通行的航道。
    据报道，美国前总统卡特与福特已率领国际观察员抵达巴拿马，考察７日的大选。巴拿马反对派也邀请了２００名外国观察员，其中１３０人已确认前往。
    巴拿马驻墨西哥大使图尔内尔说，同意外国观察员进入巴拿马考察大选，表现了巴拿马政府的民主精神与自信心。但是，美国驻巴拿马大使戴维斯说，如果巴拿马大选舞弊的话，“一切都可能会发生”。美国外交人士不愿解释是否包括“军事干涉”，但是肯定“经济制裁会升级”。据悉，美国国务院一直抱怨五角大楼对诺列加过于软弱。
