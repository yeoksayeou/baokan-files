	Editor,

	At a time when the people in the disaster-stricken areas are facing the threat of running out of food, the eight township officials in Shuiluo, Guanyang County, Sichuan Province, led by the township Party Committee Secretary, are privately dividing relief grain.

	Shuiluo Township is a poverty-stricken area. Last year, it suffered a continuous 145-day drought. The entire township of 7,800 people has an average of only about 170 kilograms of grain per person, and an average income of about 150 yuan. Out of 1,783 households, more than 1,400 are short of grain, and more than 350 households had no rice to eat at the end of last year. Since the beginning of this spring, more than 650 households in the entire township are in extreme difficulty with both money and grain shortages. In October last year and March this year, the township held two meetings to discuss the distribution of relief grain and returned grain. The township government, in violation of the state regulations on the distribution of relief grain, decided to distribute 945 kilograms of relief grain to the eight township officials. Township Party Committee Secretary Mou Shiping received 250 kilograms. Township Head Chen Shoukang received 90 kilograms for his relative, and another household that Chen Shoukang shares meals with received 50 kilograms. Deputy Township Head Liu Faxiang received 225 kilograms. The other six township officials shared 335 kilograms. The government canteen also received 40 kilograms of "relief."

	This serious incident of abusing power for personal gain and privately dividing relief grain has had a very bad impact on the people. The Guanyang County Party Committee attaches great importance to this matter. In order to uphold party discipline and government discipline and to govern the party strictly, it has been decided that, in addition to ordering all the township officials involved in the private division of relief grain to return the illegally obtained relief grain, they will be given serious party and government disciplinary punishments. Township Party Committee Secretary Mou Shiping will be expelled from the party. Township Head Chen Shoukang will be given a party disciplinary warning of two years' probation and it is recommended that he be removed from his position as township head and his status as a township people's representative by law; Deputy Township Head Liu Faxiang will be expelled from the party, and it is recommended that he be dismissed with probation and removed from his position as deputy township head and his status as a township people's representative by law.

　　水落乡八名干部竟敢私分救济粮
    编辑同志：
    正当灾区人民面临断粮威胁的时候，四川省古蔺县水落乡以乡党委书记为首的八名乡干部，却在干着集体私分救济粮的事情。
    水落乡属于贫困乡，去年遭受连续１４５天的干旱，全乡７８００多人，人均只有粮食约１７０公斤，人均收入约１５０元。１７８３户人家，就有１４００多户缺粮，去年底无米过年的就有３５０多户。今年入春以来，全乡就有６５０多户钱粮双缺的特困户，群众生活极度困难。去年１０月和今年３月，这个乡两次研究发放救济粮和返销粮，乡政府违反国家有关发放救济粮的规定，竟然堂堂皇皇地决定给八名乡干部发放救济粮共９４５公斤。乡党委书记牟世平分得２５０公斤。乡长陈寿康为自己的表亲分得９０公斤，陈寿康搭伙的一户人家分得５０公斤，副乡长刘发湘分得２２５公斤。另外六名乡干部共分得３３５公斤。政府食堂也被“救济”了４０公斤。
    这一起严重以权谋私，私分救济粮的事件，在群众中造成了极为恶劣的影响。中共古蔺县委对此非常重视，为了严肃党纪政纪，从严治党，决定除了责成全体参与私分的乡干部追回非法所得救济粮外，给予严肃的党纪、政纪处分。对古蔺县水落乡党委书记牟世平给予开除党籍处分。对水落乡乡长陈寿康给予党内留党察看两年的处分，并建议行政依法罢免其乡长职务和乡人民代表资格；对水落乡副乡长刘发湘给予开除党籍处分，并建议行政开除留用察看，依法罢免其副乡长职务和乡人民代表资格。
