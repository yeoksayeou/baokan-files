The embryonic form of China's first oil industrial base south of the Yangtze River has emerged in the remote countryside of Baise, Guangxi. This is a significant achievement from the oil and gas exploration campaign in the Baise Basin over the past three years.

The region south of the Yangtze River is economically developed but energy-deficient, with no large oil and gas fields discovered so far. However, the 11 provinces (autonomous regions) in southern China cover an area of 1.84 million square kilometers, with excellent geological conditions for oil and gas formation. There are 100 million square kilometers of sedimentary rock suitable for oil exploration, 140 medium to small Cenozoic basins, and abundant oil sources, making it a promising area for oil and gas exploration.

To quickly break through the oil and gas exploration in southern medium to small basins, the Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Oil Exploration Bureau chose the Baise Basin as the experimental battlefield and breakthrough point. Since the campaign began in June 1986, following the major breakthrough of two high-yield oil wells in May 1987, the exploration and development over the past two years have made important progress. The basin covers an area of 830 square kilometers, with oil and gas resources estimated at 140 million to over 200 million tons. Through in-depth exploration and evaluation, the geological characteristics and oil and gas enrichment patterns of the basin have been basically mastered. Five oil fields and 15 oil and gas blocks have been discovered, with proven reserves, and trial production capacity has been formed. Last year, 51,000 tons of oil and nearly 20,000 cubic meters of natural gas were produced.

The Baise Basin campaign has promoted the emergence of a new phase in southern oil exploration. Guangxi's Hepu Basin, Nanning Basin, and Ningming Basin have been selected as strategic replacement areas for oil and gas exploration during the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" and comprehensive preliminary exploration work has been carried out.

### 南方陆地勘探开发报捷  百色石油基地展现雏形

　　南方陆地勘探开发报捷    
    百色石油基地展现雏形
    本报讯  我国长江以南第一个石油工业基地的雏形，已在广西百色地区的穷乡僻壤中出现。这是近３年来，百色盆地油气勘探会战的重大成果。
    长江以南地区，经济发达，能源紧缺，至今仍未找到较大油气田。而南方１１省（区）陆地面积１８４万平方公里，具有良好的成油气地质条件，可供找油的沉积岩面积１００万平方公里，有１４０个中新生代的中小盆地，油源丰富，是前景良好的油气勘探后备区。
    为尽快打开南方中小盆地油气勘探的局面，滇黔桂石油勘探局以百色盆地为试验战场和突破口，从１９８６年６月会战以来，继１９８７年５月获两口高产油井的重大突破后，近两年的勘探开发又有重要进展。这个盆地面积８３０平方公里，油气资源量为１．４亿—２亿多吨，经过深入勘探和评价，基本上掌握了盆地石油地质特征和油气富集规律，发现５个油田、１５个油气区块，掌握了一定储量，形成了试生产能力，去年产油５．１万吨、天然气近２万立方米。
    百色盆地会战，促进南方找油新局面的出现。广西的合浦盆地、南宁盆地、宁明盆地，已被选为“八五”油气勘探战略接替区，全面开展了勘探前期工作。
