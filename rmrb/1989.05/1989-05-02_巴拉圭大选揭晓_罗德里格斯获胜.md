Paraguay Election Results Announced: Rodriguez Wins

	From our correspondents in Brasilia and Buenos Aires, Lan Caiji and Li Zhimin report: According to news from Asuncion, the results of the May 2nd Paraguay election have been announced. Interim President and ruling Red Party candidate Rodriguez won with 75.01% of the votes, while the main opposition party, the Authentic Radical Liberal Party candidate, Laino, received 20.26% of the votes. The election on May 1st was held in a calm atmosphere. Although the opposition party accused of fraud, it is generally considered that this was the freest election in Paraguay in 34 years. Many of those who voted for Rodriguez believe he is the hero who overthrew the Stroessner dictatorship.

	Through television news, our correspondents saw that the election atmosphere in various parts of Paraguay was quite lively. Voting stations were uniformly equipped with specially made purple ink, and voters had to dip their index fingers in this ink after voting as a mark of having already voted, thus preventing fraudulent repeat voting. It was reported that 300 foreign journalists rushed to Asuncion to cover this election, and many international organizations and foreign political parties sent representatives as observers to inspect the situation of Paraguay's election.

　　巴拉圭大选揭晓    
    罗德里格斯获胜
    综合本报巴西利亚和布宜诺斯艾利斯电  记者兰才基、李志明报道：据亚松森消息，５月２日巴拉圭大选揭晓。临时总统、执政党红党候选人罗德里格斯以７５．０１％的选票当选总统，最大的反对党真正激进自由党候选人莱诺得到２０．２６％的选票。１日的选举在平静的气氛中举行。虽然反对党指控有舞弊现象，但一般认为这是３４年来巴拉圭最自由的选举。不少投罗德里格斯票的人认为，他是推翻斯特罗斯纳独裁政府的英雄。
    记者通过电视新闻看到，在巴拉圭各地举行的选举气氛相当热烈，投票站都统一备置了特制的紫色墨水，选民投票之后必须在食指上浸上这种墨水，作为已经投过票的记号，以此避免重复投票的作弊行为。报道说，有３００名外国记者拥到亚松森报道这次大选，还有许多国际组织和外国政党的代表以观察员身份前去考察巴拉圭这次大选的情况。
