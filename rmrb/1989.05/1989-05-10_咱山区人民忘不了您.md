During the time Hu Yaobang was serving as the General Secretary, there was one event that I will always remember and never forget!

It was the summer of 1986. I, as a retired teacher from Hongyang Township of Changyang Tujia Autonomous County, was entrusted by the villagers of Hongyanzi to write a letter to Hu Yaobang, expressing our strong desire to build a road.

At that time, our township had a road leading to Yichang City, which had been under construction for over 10 years. Both sides of the road had already been completed and opened to traffic, except for the 8-mile-long section near our Hongyanzi village. Due to various reasons, this section had been stalled for nearly ten years and could not be completed, resulting in the entire 160-mile road not being fully operational. This affected the construction and development of the mountainous area. After much thought, I decided to write to the General Secretary, hoping that he would care about our plight. However, I was unsure if my letter would even reach the central government, and even if it did, with the General Secretary's busy schedule, would he have the time to personally attend to it? Nevertheless, I mustered the courage to write the letter, hoping for his attention. The letter was sent, and I waited to see what would happen.

Half a year later, in the spring of 1987, county leaders came to my home and told me that the matter I had reported to the central leadership had been resolved. After investigations and research by the provincial authorities, it was decided to build the road as soon as possible. I was so moved that tears welled up in my eyes, and I didn't know what to say!

The news spread quickly, and the villagers were overjoyed, spreading the word: "The General Secretary cares about us, and the road through Hongyanzi will soon be open." Last year, the province allocated 160,000 yuan to Changyang specifically for building this poverty-alleviation road. Construction began in February this year. I volunteered to take on the task of managing the explosives. It is estimated that the road will be fully operational by October this year. At that time, I plan to write another letter to Hu Yaobang to report the good news, albeit presumptuously.

Unfortunately, soon after the construction began, on April 15, we heard the sad news of Hu Yaobang's passing from the mournful broadcast. My fellow villagers and I were deeply grieved!

Hu Yaobang's passing is not only a great loss to our party and the entire nation but also a tremendous loss to the millions of people in the mountainous areas whom he cared for. However, his brilliant achievements will forever shine on the high mountains of Hongyan!

　　咱山区人民忘不了您
    湖北省长阳土家族自治县退休教师  朱声刚
    胡耀邦同志任总书记期间，有一件事使我至今铭记在心，永世难忘！
    那是１９８６年的夏天，我受长阳土家族自治县红岩村众乡亲的委托，以一个退休教师的名义，上书胡耀邦同志，陈述渴望修建公路的愿望。
    当时，我乡有一条通往宜昌市的公路，修了１０余年，两边早已竣工通车，唯有我家红岩子那一段８里多长的路，因种种原因搁浅近十年，无法修通，功亏一篑，致使这条长达１６０里的公路，不能全线通车，影响了山区的建设和开发。为此，我沉思良久，心想：总书记是很关怀山区人民困难的，但我写信能否送到中央还是问题，即或到了中央，总书记日理万机，哪有时间亲自过问？但我还是鼓着勇气，冒昧陈词，请求给予关怀。信就这样寄出了，试试看。
    事隔半年，也就是１９８７年的春天，县领导来我家中，说我向中央领导反映的事，已有着落了，经省里调查研究决定，准备尽早修通这段公路。一时我感动得热泪盈眶，不知说什么好！
    消息不胫而走，村民们喜出望外，奔走相告：“总书记关心我们，红岩子也快通车了。”去年省里给长阳拨款１６万元，专修这条扶贫路，今年２月已正式动工兴建。我个人自告奋勇地承担了保管炸药的任务，预计这条公路今年１０月即可全线通车。到时，我还想冒昧再次给胡耀邦同志写一封报喜信。
    谁知在开工不久，也就是４月１５日，从广播的阵阵哀乐声中，传来胡耀邦同志不幸因病与世长辞的噩耗，我和乡亲们都感到深切悲痛！
    胡耀邦同志的逝世，不仅是我党和全国人民的巨大损失，也使他生前关怀着的千万山区人民痛失了一位不可多得的亲人，但他的光辉业绩将永远映照在红岩的高山上！
