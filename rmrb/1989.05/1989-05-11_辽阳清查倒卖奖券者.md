Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 10th.

The news report "Scalpers of Prize-Bearing Securities Appear on Liaoyang Streets" (see the second page of this newspaper on April 11th) has drawn significant attention in Liaoyang. The People's Bank of Liaoyang, the Public Security Bureau, and the Industrial and Commercial Bureau have taken joint action to formulate the "Notice on Rectifying the Financial Market," which has been propagated through newspapers, radio, and television. They have also posted and broadcast the notice at bank prize-drawing locations. Additionally, they have formed small task forces to patrol the streets and alleys. So far, they have shut down more than 20 registered collection stalls and seized a batch of prize-bearing treasury bonds and national savings bonds. Through this rectification, the front of various banks no longer sees open scalpers. However, it is reported that some individuals have gone underground, continuing their illicit buying and selling activities in secret.

    据新华社沈阳５月１０日电（通讯员陈殿升）《辽阳街头出现倒卖奖券者》消息（见本报４月１１日二版）见报后，引起了辽阳市的重视。辽阳市人民银行、公安局和工商局联合行动，制订了《整顿金融市场通告》，通过报纸、电台和电视台进行宣传，并在银行摸奖处张贴、广播。他们还组成了整顿金融市场小分队，在大街小巷查堵。到目前为止，已取消了２０多个挂牌收购摊点，没收了一批有奖债券和国库券。通过治理整顿，各银行门前已不见公开收购奖券者。但据悉，仍有一部分人转入地下，暗中进行倒买倒卖活动。
