The Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are among the wealthiest regions in the world, with high purchasing power. Silk products are beginning to gain popularity among consumers.

The Nordic countries do not engage in sericulture or extensive silk processing; they primarily import silk fabrics, clothing, and silk products. In silk shops in the Nordic countries, mid-range clothing sells for $150 to $450, while high-end clothing can reach $7,000. True silk scarves are priced at around $45 each, and women's blouses at $35. The Nordic people have limited knowledge about silk. They first look at the brand, then the price and material. For example, a synthetic cotton skirt from a famous brand can sell for $60, a price comparable to that of true silk fabric. Due to the cold climate and the skin tones of the Nordic people, darker colors are popular. Black, navy blue, dark green, and burgundy are favored, while yellow, brown, and light green have little market appeal. The popular patterns in the Nordic countries differ from those in Western Europe, with single-colored fabrics, geometric patterns, and small to medium-sized checks being more popular. The trade characteristics of silk in the Nordic countries include low minimum order quantities and short delivery times, with fashion items typically delivered within 45 days after confirmation. According to trade professionals in Finland and Denmark, the consumption of silk in the Nordic countries is clearly increasing. Although the market size in each country is limited, Nordic silk merchants closely cooperate and place combined orders, making the total order quantity attractive. In summary, the Nordic region is a market with significant potential for silk products, and we should pay close attention to it.

　　一个有潜力的丝绸成品市场
    北欧四国（丹麦、芬兰、挪威、瑞典）都属于世界上最富裕的地区之一，人们购买力很高，丝绸产品已开始受到消费者的喜爱。
    北欧国家不从事蚕桑生产，也不进行广泛的丝绸加工，主要进口绸缎、服装和丝绸成品。在北欧国家的丝绸商店里，中档服装卖１５０—４５０美元，高档服装可达７０００美元，真丝头巾每条４５美元左右，女衬衫３５美元。北欧人对丝绸了解不多，他们买东西先看牌子，再看价格和原料，如名牌的人造棉套裙也可卖到６０美元，价格与真丝面料差不多。对于服装的色彩，因气候寒冷，以及北欧人肤色的缘故，流行色彩偏暗。黑色、深海军蓝、墨绿、紫红很受欢迎，黄、棕、浅绿则没有市场。北欧流行的花形与西欧不同，单色的面料、几何形图案、中小格子等较受欢迎。北欧丝绸的贸易特点是起订量较低，交货期要求短，时装交货期一般是确认后４５天。据芬兰、丹麦的贸易界人士说：北欧国家的丝绸消费量正明显增长，虽然各自的市场规模有限，但北欧的丝绸商密切合作，联合订单数量是富有吸引力的。总之，北欧是大有潜力可挖的丝绸成品市场，我们应该加以重视。
