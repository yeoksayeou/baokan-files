The international symposium “Man and the Biosphere: Past and Present” was held in March 1989 in Bushna, Moscow. This event was organized by the United Nations, the Soviet Academy of Sciences, the Ecological Research Center, and the Soviet Philosophical Society. Over a hundred representatives from eleven countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Poland, and China, were invited to attend. The renowned Italian scholar and member of the Club of Rome, Lazlo, delivered a special report at the conference. Scientists and philosophers from various countries discussed the current state of global issues, the prospects for the development of man and the biosphere, and the theory and practice of building the noosphere from the perspectives of natural sciences and social sciences.

The conference's central theme was to commemorate the great Soviet scientist V. Vernadsky and to carry forward the spirit of his "noosphere" theory. Vernadsky, a contemporary Soviet geophysicist and ecologist, initiated research on the relationship between man and the biosphere in the 1940s. He proposed the theory of the geochemical cycle of the Earth and first introduced the concept of the noosphere. The noosphere refers to the organized interaction between nature and society (through human conscious activity), aiming at the harmonious development of man and the biosphere. In today's world, where global issues are becoming increasingly acute, the internal order of the biosphere is being destroyed, and the relationship between man and nature is becoming increasingly tense, Vernadsky's theory and concept are increasingly revealing their rich practical significance and profound historical implications, attracting the attention of scientists and philosophers from various countries.

The scholars present from various countries cited numerous facts and data to illustrate the urgency of the current ecological situation and expressed great concern and attention for the safety of the biosphere and human survival. European and Soviet scholars conducted specific studies on energy shortages, environmental pollution, resource scarcity, and food crises, particularly emphasizing the significance of curbing the threat of nuclear war in protecting the Earth's biosphere and the fate of all humanity. Chinese scholar Zhou Yicheng, in his speech at the conference, introduced three major problems in China's economic reform regarding the protection of the biosphere: excessive exploitation of natural resources, severe environmental pollution, and overpopulation, which aroused great interest among the representatives of various countries.

The core content of the noosphere concept—the relationship between man and nature—was the theoretical focus of the discussions among the representatives of various countries at this conference. Italian scholar Lazlo delivered a speech titled "The Survival of the Earth and the Responsibility of Science" at the conference. Swiss scholar Barunin called for enhancing human rationality and self-discipline, placing hope in the social sphere. Scholars recognized that the emergence of contemporary global problems is the result of human rationality losing control. Humanity must, with a new philosophical consciousness, re-examine its attitude towards nature since the Industrial Revolution and prevent the development of science and technology from destroying the Earth and humanity itself.

Philosophers and ecologists also had a relatively thorough discussion on the relationship between economic development and ecological protection. Soviet scholar M. Lemanshev particularly pointed out that this is a very realistic and urgent problem for developing countries. Contemporary humanity should appropriately reduce the scale of production to protect the synchronization of human development with nature. For developing countries, the greatest misfortune is to follow the industrial development path of developed countries and replicate their mistakes. Developing countries should forge their own development path, where economic development and ecological development should not be opposed. Some representatives proposed that the contradiction between economic development and ecological development is objectively existent, and humanity has not yet found a shortcut to resolve this contradiction. Scholars from various countries unanimously agreed that an important task for scientists and philosophers at present is to educate politicians and government leaders on ecological knowledge and global issues concepts, so as to coordinate human actions on a global scale in an organized and effective manner, avoiding global ecological disasters.

The conference conducted extensive discussions on the theory and practice of contemporary global issues and the relationship between man and nature. However, in terms of how to promote the alliance between social scientists and ecologists, how to fully explore the philosophical methodology of the noosphere concept, and how to summarize and inherit the historical heritage of various countries and nations in the study of the relationship between man and nature, there is still much to be explored.

　　“智力圈”理论的新发展   
    ——莫斯科·布什纳国际会议综述
    由联合国委托苏联科学院、生态研究中心、苏联哲学学会等单位主办的“人与生物圈：历史与现时代”国际研讨会于１９８９年３月在莫斯科的布什纳举行。应邀参加这次会议的有美、英、法、意、波、中等十一个国家的百余名代表。意大利学者、当代世界著名思想家、罗马俱乐部的成员拉兹洛出席了会议并作了专题报告。各国科学家、哲学家从自然科学与哲学社会科学多学科综合的角度，对当代全球性问题的发展现状、人与生物圈发展的前景以及智力圈建设的理论和实践进行了广泛的讨论。
    纪念伟大的苏联科学家Ｖ·维尔纳斯基、弘扬其所奠定的“智力圈”理论的精神，是本次大会的中心议题。维尔纳斯基，当代苏联地球物理生态学家，他于本世纪４０年代开创了对地球上人与生物圈关系的研究，提出了地球物理生物化学大循环的理论，首创了“智力圈”概念。所谓“智力圈”是指自然与社会之间有组织的（通过人的自觉活动）相互作用的领域，它以人与生物圈的和谐发展为目标。在当代全球性问题日益尖锐，生物圈内在秩序受到毁坏，人与自然关系日趋紧张的今天，维尔纳斯基的理论和概念日益展示出其丰富的现实内涵和深远的历史意义，受到各国科学家、哲学家的共同关注。
    与会的各国学者，列举大量事实和数据陈述了当前生态情势的紧迫性，对生物圈的安全和人类的生存表示了极大的忧虑和关注。欧洲大陆和苏联的学者对能源匮乏、环境污染、资源短缺、粮食危机进行了具体的研究，尤其是提出了遏制核战争的威胁对保护地球生物圈和全人类命运的意义。中国学者周义澄在会议发言中介绍了中国经济改革中在生物圈保护方面所存在的三大问题：即过度索取自然资源；自然环境污染严重；人口过剩，引起了各国代表的极大兴趣。
    智力圈概念的核心内容——人与自然的关系问题是本次大会各国代表讨论的理论焦点。意大利学者拉兹洛作了以“地球的生存与科学的责任”为题的大会发言。瑞士学者巴鲁宁则呼吁提高人类的理性自律，寄希望于社会圈。学者们认识到，当代全球问题的产生，是人类理性失去控制的结果，人类必须以一种全新的哲学意识重新检讨自工业革命以来人类对自然界的态度，防止科学技术的发展毁灭地球和人类自身。
    哲学家和生态学家还就经济发展与生态保护的关系问题进行了比较充分的讨论。苏联学者Ｍ·莱曼舍夫特别指出，这是一个对发展中国家尤为现实而迫切的问题。当代人类应当适当缩小生产规模，以保护她与自然的同步发展。对于发展中国家来说，最大的不幸是模仿发达国家所走过的发展工业的道路，照搬发达国家的错误。发展中国家应当走自己的发展道路，其经济发展与生态发展不应产生对立。有的代表提出，经济发展与生态发展的矛盾是客观存在的，现在人类还没有找到摆脱这一矛盾的捷径。各国学者一致认为，科学家和哲学家们当前的一个重要任务是对政治家和政府领导人进行生态知识和全球问题观念的教育，以便在世界范围内有组织地、有效地协调人类的行动，避免全球生态惨祸。
    会议对当代全球问题、人与自然关系的实践和理论都作了广泛的探讨。但是在如何促进社会科学家与生态学家的结盟、如何充分挖掘智力圈概念的哲学方法论内涵、如何总结和继承各国家、各民族对人与自然关系研究的历史遗产等方面，仍然有待深入探究。
