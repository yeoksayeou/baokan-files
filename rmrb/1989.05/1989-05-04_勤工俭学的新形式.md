In Belgrade, at the exhibition halls, airports, nursing homes, factories, restaurants, hotels, and other public places, one can encounter university students engaged in work-study programs. Statistics show that 60% of Belgrade's university students participate in various paid services and labor each year. Last year, their total labor income reached several billion dinars (at the time, 5,000 dinars were approximately equal to 1 USD).

The work-study activities of Yugoslavian university students are uniformly organized and guided by local student cooperatives. In the capital, there are two student cooperatives. The Belgrade Student Cooperative, located in the city center, was established in 1931 and currently has over 25,000 members and 29 managers. According to the female manager Liliyana, any regular university student in Belgrade under the age of 30 can become a member by submitting a written application. The cooperative's mission is to help a broad range of students earn economic income through their labor to supplement their study expenses or other needs, and to contact, understand, and consolidate the knowledge they have learned in society through practical work.

The Belgrade Student Cooperative has contractual relationships with over 5,000 enterprises and institutions in the city. Every morning, these units notify the cooperative of the various temporary jobs they need, with varying durations. The cooperative then allocates these jobs to its members according to the registration sequence and professional requirements. The remuneration for university student temporary workers is the same as that of the unit's employees, and the cooperative is responsible for settling and fully transferring the payments to the students. Additionally, the employing units pay the cooperative a handling fee equivalent to 10% of the temporary workers' wages.

The cooperative does not introduce jobs from individual or private enterprises. The types of work include typing, transcription, translation, guiding, security, loading and unloading, and various sanitation and service jobs, with most of them being physical labor. Generally, male students prefer to do jobs with high labor intensity and harsh conditions, which not only toughens them up but also allows them to earn more income in a shorter period. To avoid affecting their studies, the cooperative stipulates that each student's annual labor income cannot exceed 40 million dinars. If their labor income registration card reaches this amount, no new jobs will be assigned to them. The cooperative has strict labor discipline, requiring each member to follow the production order of the employing unit, protect public property, and maintain the cooperative's reputation. If there are violations, they will be dealt with by the cooperative's disciplinary committee and compensate for material losses. Serious cases will be referred to the court. If an accident occurs during work, the cooperative will provide all medical expenses and insurance.

Enterprises and institutions hiring university students as temporary workers through the cooperative can have them on call, at reasonable prices, with reliable personnel, and good labor quality. Students participating in work-study through the cooperative have no economic risks and the procedures are simple. They can deepen their understanding of relevant enterprises and institutions during the work process, which will help them make correct choices when looking for jobs after graduation. The school authorities also strongly support the organized and controlled work-study activities arranged by the cooperative. It not only increases students' economic income but also prevents the influx of market influences into the campus, disrupting normal teaching order.

　　勤工俭学的新形式
    本报记者  严正
    在贝尔格莱德的博览会、飞机场、养老院、厂矿企业、餐厅旅馆和其它公共场所，都能遇到勤工俭学的大学生，据统计，贝尔格莱德每年有６０％的大学生参加各种有偿服务和劳动，去年他们的劳动总收入达到数十亿第纳尔（当时５０００第纳尔约合１美元）。
    南斯拉夫大学生勤工俭学活动统一由各地的大学生合作社负责组织和指导。在首都有两个大学生合作社。座落市中心的贝尔格莱德大学生合作社建于１９３１年，目前有２５０００多个成员、２９个管理人员。据女经理莉莉娅娜介绍，凡在贝尔格莱德上学、年龄不超过３０岁的正规大学生，只要提出书面申请，都可以成为其成员。合作社的宗旨是帮助广大学生通过自己的劳动获得经济收入，以补贴学习费用或其它需要；并在劳动实践中接触、了解社会，运用和巩固学到的知识。
    贝尔格莱德大学生合作社与全市５０００多家企事业单位建有合同关系，每天早晨，这些单位把所需时间长短不等的各种临时工数通知合作社，由合作社按照登记次序和专业要求分配给自己的成员。大学生临时工的报酬与用人单位职工同工同酬，由合作社负责结算并全数转发给大学生。另外，用人单位还付给合作社相当于临时工报酬１０％的手续费。
    合作社介绍的工作单位不包括个体户和私营企业，工作项目有打字誊印、翻译向导、门卫值班、搬运装卸以及各种卫生、服务工作，其中体力劳动占多数。一般男大学生宁愿干劳动强度大、条件艰苦的活，这不但能锻炼自己，而且可以在较短的时间内获得较多的报酬。为了不影响学习任务，合作社规定每个大学生年劳动收入不能超过４００万第纳尔，如他的劳动收入登记卡上已达到此数就不再安排新的工作。合作社订有严格的劳动纪律，要求每个成员遵守用人单位的生产秩序，爱护社会财富，维护合作社声誉，若出现违纪现象，要受到合作社纪律委员会的查处，并赔偿物质损失，性质严重的将诉诸于法院。如在劳动中发生意外事故，则由合作社提供各种医疗费用和保险金。
    企事业单位通过合作社雇大学生当临时工，可以随叫随到，价格合理，人员可靠，劳动质量也好。而大学生通过合作社参加勤工俭学，没有任何经济风险，手续也简便。他们在劳动过程中可增进与有关企事业单位的互相了解，以便在毕业寻找工作时正确地作出双向选择。校方也非常支持由合作社安排有组织有控制的勤工俭学活动，它既可增加学生经济收入，又防止市肆之风刮进校园，扰乱正常的教学秩序。
