The learning from Lei Feng movement that emerged in the 1960s had a profound and wide-ranging social impact, making it the most influential among numerous hero-learning activities since the founding of the nation. Later, people lamented, "Uncle Lei Feng has disappeared."

Why did the spirit of Lei Feng once leave such a deep imprint on the hearts of the Chinese people, yet fail to flourish again today? Various questions compel us to reflect deeply on the essence and core of the spirit of Lei Feng.

Lei Feng, as an individual exemplar, has many valuable spiritual qualities that can be directly observed or derived from his deeds. However, the spirit of Lei Feng, as a social phenomenon, should not be arbitrarily "tailored" with a "political scissor." The mistake of the past lies in this. During the height of studying "The Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Lei Feng was a model for studying Mao's works; during the emphasis on "class struggle," Lei Feng was a typical example of class struggle; when technical skills were emphasized, Lei Feng's story of diligent practice became the focus of propaganda; now, some people say, Lei Feng also wore "Mao cloth" trousers, and Lei Feng also talked about love...

Strange indeed! How can a spiritual monument of social progress become a "puzzle" or "playdough" for anyone to mold and use as they please?

How should we grasp the essence and core of the spirit of Lei Feng? This depends on the results of social practice. The inscriptions of great men are indeed profound and insightful, the theories of scholars are indeed deep and profound, the unit where Lei Feng worked indeed knew the facts, but none of these can serve as the "standard" for determining the essence and core of the spirit of Lei Feng. The only entity that can undertake this task is the social practice of tens of millions of people.

Listening to the voices and evaluations of the people can solve this problem. Someone who does good deeds is called a "living Lei Feng" by the people; someone who helps others is called a "living Lei Feng" by the people; someone who returns lost property is called a "living Lei Feng" by the people; someone who respects the elderly and loves the young is called a "living Lei Feng" by the people; and so on. No matter how you look at it, the people have a scale in their hearts. This scale's "polar star" is accurate for both the connotation and extension of the spirit of Lei Feng.

No matter how society's politics, economy, and culture develop, mutual concern, help, and love among people should always be more the better. Only by viewing it this way can the spirit of Lei Feng not become outdated.

### 关于“雷锋精神”

　　关于“雷锋精神”
    新疆军区政治部  王超海
    六十年代兴起的学雷锋活动，所产生的社会影响之深之广，应属建国后学习无数英雄活动之最。后来人们慨叹，“雷锋叔叔不见了”。
    为什么雷锋精神昔日能对国人的心灵打下极深的烙印，如今却不能再蔚然成风呢？种种疑问使人们不能不深刻反思：雷锋精神的实质和精髓？
    雷锋作为一个典型个人，从他的事迹中可以直观或派生出许多可贵的精神。但雷锋精神作为一种社会形态的精神，其实质和精髓我认为不应该随意用“政治剪刀”去“剪裁”。昔日吃亏就在于此。在学“毛著”高潮中，雷锋是学毛著的榜样；在抓“阶级斗争”时，雷锋是阶级斗争的典型；强调学技术，雷锋苦练技术的事迹成了宣传的重点；现在，有人又说，雷锋也穿过“毛料”裤，说雷锋也谈过恋爱……
    真也怪了！一个社会进步的精神丰碑，怎能成为任人捏塑、为我所用的“七巧板”、“橡皮泥”！
    如何把握雷锋精神的实质和精髓呢？这要看社会实践检验的结果。伟人们的题词固然高屋建瓴，理论者的论述固然深邃精辟，生前单位固然了解实情，但都不能作为确定雷锋精神实质和精髓的“标尺”。能担此重任者，唯有千百万群众的社会实践。
    听一听人民群众的呼声和评价，这个问题就可以迎刃而解。有人见义勇为，群众称其“活雷锋”；有人助人为乐，群众称其“活雷锋”；有人拾金不昧，群众称其“活雷锋”；有人尊老爱幼，群众称其“活雷锋”；等等。不管怎么讲，反正是群众心中有杆秤。这杆秤的“定盘星”，对雷锋精神的内涵和外延都是准确的。
    无论社会的政治、经济、文化如何发展，人与人之间的关心、帮助、友爱总是应越多越好。只有这样看，雷锋精神才不会时过境迁。
