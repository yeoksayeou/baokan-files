The Cigang Railway Station is a small station southeast of Manzhouli, but the "World's Number One Basket" there is famous far and wide.

The so-called "World's Number One Basket" was woven from willow twigs in 1964, with a diameter of 5 chi and a height of 5.4 zhang. Someone once hung a two-zhang-high curtain on the large basket with five large characters written on it: "World's Number One Basket."

This basket, filled with over 30 tons of furnace ash, wrapped around the pipeline leading to the top of the water tower. During the coldest days of winter, when temperatures drop to minus forty degrees, the water tower does not freeze without burning coal for heating, ensuring a daily water supply for over 20 passing trains. Before this, during one winter, just to keep the water tower warm required burning over a hundred tons of coal. The Ministry of Railways called this thriftiness the "Cigang Spirit" and advocated for its adoption throughout the railway system. In the northern part of China, just by using woven baskets for insulation, water supply stations save the country tens of thousands of tons of coal each year.

The "World's Number One Basket" is just a microcosm of the Cigang Spirit. Over the years, they have used every means to save the country's expenses. Winter insulation for water towers, heating for workplaces, and daily water heating all rely on sweeping coal cars, picking up cow dung, sifting furnace ash, and gathering coal slag. When the floor of the machine room was damaged, they used cement and stones obtained from sweeping the bottom of cars to repair it.

Now, 25 years have passed. Is the large basket still there? Has the Cigang Spirit been maintained? The reporter went to Cigang at the beginning of this month. Unfortunately, the "World's Number One Basket" was dismantled in 1981 due to the decay of the willow twigs and was replaced with asbestos. The old foreman who first proposed the basket, Lü Changsong, has also retired. However, it is gratifying that the influence of the "big basket" remains, the Cigang Spirit still exists, and it is passed down from generation to generation, flourishing.

Over the past 20 years, the Cigang Water Supply Station has used cement and scrap steel obtained from "picking up trash" to build a neat and elegant courtyard wall, transforming the former simple courtyard enclosed by iron wire into a garden-like setting. The station still does not ask the state for coal, relying on everyone sweeping the bottom of cars and picking up coal slag to solve the problem. All 18 light bulbs in the station have been changed from 100 watts to 40 watts, and since the station was electrified in 1973, 75,000 degrees of electricity have been saved over 15 years; 38 years of saving various expenses for the state total over 400,000 yuan.

### “天下第一筐”

　　“天下第一筐”
    本报记者  武培真
    嵯岗火车站是满洲里东南的一个小站，然而那里的“天下第一筐”却名传遐迩。
    所谓“天下第一筐”，于１９６４年用柳条编成，直径５尺，高５．４丈。有人曾将两丈高的布幔挂在大筐上，上写五个大字——“天下第一筐”。
    这个筐，内装３０多吨炉灰，把通往水塔顶端的管线团团裹住。三九寒天，零下四十来度，不用烧煤供暖，水塔不冻，保证每天为２０多列过往火车供水。而在这之前，一个冬期，光水塔保温就要烧煤上百吨。铁道部把这种勤俭精神称为“嵯岗精神”，号召全路学习。我国北方各铁路给水所，仅编筐保温这一项，一年便为国家节煤上万吨。
    “天下第一筐”只是嵯岗精神的一个缩影，多年来，他们千方百计为国家节省开支。水塔冬季保温、工作场地供暖及平素烧水用煤，他们靠扫煤车、拾牛粪、筛炉灰、拣煤渣来解决；机房地板坏了，他们用扫车底所获水泥和石子铺。
    如今，２５年过去了，大筐是否仍在？嵯岗精神是否保持？记者于本月初奔赴嵯岗。很遗憾，“天下第一筐”因年月长久，柳条朽坏，已于１９８１年被拆除，而被石棉所代替，当年首倡编筐的老工长吕长松也已退休。然而，令人欣慰的是，“大筐”影响尚在，嵯岗精神犹存，且代代相传，发扬光大。
    ２０多年来，嵯岗给水所依靠“拣破烂”所得水泥和废钢铁修起了一道整齐大方的院墙，把以往由铁丝网圈成的简陋小院美化得像花园一样，全所所用煤炭照样不向国家伸手，仍靠大家扫车底拣煤渣解决。全所１８盏灯泡，都从１００瓦换成了４０瓦，全所自１９７３年通电至今，１５年间，共节电７．５万度；３８年为国家节约各项开支４０多万元。
