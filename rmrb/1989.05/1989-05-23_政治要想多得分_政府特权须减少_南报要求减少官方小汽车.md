Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 20th.

Political points can only be scored by reducing government privileges. The South Report calls for a reduction in official cars.

According to the *Borba* newspaper, the official cars that roam the roads of Yugoslavia cost $10,000 per vehicle annually. There are currently 155,000 such vehicles, meaning an annual expenditure of $1.55 billion. This amount exceeds half of Yugoslavia's annual tourism revenue.

The newspaper recalls that two years ago, the Federal Assembly called for a reduction in the number of official cars and stricter controls on the use of these vehicles. However, this privilege is difficult to abolish because the beneficiaries use various means, including political and economic methods, to retain it.

The newspaper states that 90% of official cars can be reduced without affecting work. Some official cars can be sold at preferential prices to taxi drivers.

*Borba* points out that since the country's foreign debt has reached nearly $20 billion, this unnecessary expenditure is too large.

The newspaper concludes that the new Yugoslav government must start reducing privileges if it wants to score more politically.

　　政治要想多得分
    政府特权须减少
    南报要求减少官方小汽车
    据新华社贝尔格莱德５月２０日电  据《战斗报》报道，南斯拉夫在各公路上奔驰的官方小汽车每辆一年要花费１万美元，目前有１５．５万辆这样的小汽车，也就是说，一年总开销为１５．５亿美元。这笔费用超过南斯拉夫全年旅游收入的一半。
    这家报纸回顾说，两年以前，联邦议会就要求减少官方小汽车的数量和更严格地控制使用小汽车的标准，但是这个特权很难取消，因为那些受益者使用各种办法，其中包括政治和经济手段来保住它不放。
    这家报纸说，官方的小汽车可以削减９０％，这不会对工作有影响。有些官方小汽车可以以优惠价格卖给出租汽车司机。
    《战斗报》指出，由于这个国家的外债已达差不多２００亿美元，所以这笔无用的开支太大了。
    这家报纸得出结论说，新的南斯拉夫政府必须开始减少特权，如果它想在政治上取得更多得分的话。
