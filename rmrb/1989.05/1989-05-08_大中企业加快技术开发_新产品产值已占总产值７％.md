Large and Medium-Sized Enterprises Accelerate Technological Development
New Product Output Accounts for 7% of Total Output

	Beijing, May 8 (Xinhua) — The proportion of technical personnel engaged in technological development in large and medium-sized enterprises in China has increased from 16.6% in 1985 to 23% currently. The establishment of technological development institutions has also grown from 30% to 50%. The share of new product output in the total industrial output has risen from 3.3% in 1984 to 7% in 1987. This indicates that technological development work in Chinese enterprises has been strengthened in recent years.

	Last year, the State Planning Commission, in collaboration with the State Taxation Bureau, the Ministry of Materials, and the Industrial and Commercial Bank, formulated the "National Key New Product Trial Production Plan" for 1988, developing a total of 2,598 new products. According to a survey of 200 projects in 10 provinces, the output value reached 2.395 billion yuan, generating 341 million yuan in profits and taxes. All regions have exceeded the planned technological development targets. According to incomplete statistics from 19 provinces and municipalities, 26,000 new products have been developed, with an output value of 4.13 billion yuan. Shenyang City held a "New Product Development Year," with new product output increasing by 54% and profits and taxes by 61.33% compared to 1987. In recent years, 80% of the products produced in Jilin that are in demand have been new products.
