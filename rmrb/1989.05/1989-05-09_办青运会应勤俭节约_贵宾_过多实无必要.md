The Second National Youth Games should be frugal and avoid excessive invitation of guests

The Second National Youth Games will be held in Liaoning Province this September. During an interview, the reporter saw a reply from the State Sports Commission dated April 22 to the Liaoning Provincial Sports Commission regarding this event. The second item in the reply states: "It is agreed that the Second National Youth Games will only have an organizing committee and will not have a presidium. Leaders from the National Sports Federation, the Chinese Olympic Committee, and relevant departments can be invited as honored guests." The reporter believes that after canceling the group gymnastics performance, the Second Youth Games decided not to set up a presidium, which is a new reform worth promoting; the "invitation of honored guests" mentioned in the reply can also be omitted.

Recently, Li Xiaosheng, the director of the Liaoning Provincial Sports Commission, said in a conversation with the reporter: "We welcome relevant leaders to come to Liaoning to see the Youth Games." As the host, making this gesture out of courtesy is understandable. However, is it necessary to invite honored guests?

Looking back at the past few years, the scale of comprehensive sports events held in China has been increasingly high, and the number of invited guests and uninvited but high-status visitors has been increasing. Even some guests' wives and children are included in the "invitation" list. According to the reporter's observation, some invited guests did not come to watch the sports competitions with all their heart. During the Sixth National Games, some people took the opportunity to tour Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Hainan Island; during the City Games, some people went to visit Qufu, Mount Tai, and the Yellow River Bridge; during the Ethnic Minorities Games held in Urumqi, some people boated on Tianchi Lake and admired the Tian Shan Mountains; during the First Youth Games, some people traveled between the ancient cities of Kaifeng and Luoyang. These people were all invited guests, and the organizing units certainly could not neglect them, having to arrange vehicles, book tickets, and accommodate them, busy beyond measure, and still having to pay for these unnecessary expenses from the limited funds of the competition.

Of course, there are also some invited guests who, out of courtesy, have to put down their work and attend the event. Why should the organizers force them to do so?

As for the leaders of the National Sports Federation and the Chinese Olympic Committee, they are originally officials in the sports field. If the competition needs their participation in leadership and organizational work, they should participate as staff members and do not need to be "honored guests." Inviting domestic guests (who are actually internal guests) to "observe" on public funds is not advisable in the context of limited funds.

### 办青运会应勤俭节约  “贵宾”过多实无必要

　　办青运会应勤俭节约    
    “贵宾”过多实无必要
    第二届全国青少年运动会将于今年９月在辽宁举行。记者在采访中，看到国家体委４月２２日给辽宁省体委就这届运动会发出的一份复函，复函中的第二项说：“同意第二届全国青少年运动会只设组委会，不再设主席团。全国体总、中国奥委会和有关部门的领导，可按贵宾邀请出席。”记者认为，第二届青运会在取消团体操表演之后，又决定不设主席团，这是一项新的改革，值得提倡；复函中所说的“邀请贵宾”，似也可以省掉。
    日前，辽宁省体委主任李孝生在同记者谈话时说：“有关领导来辽宁看一看青运会，我们还是欢迎的。”作为东道主出于礼节作出这一姿态是无可非议的。但是否一定要邀请贵宾出席呢？
    回顾近几年，我国举办的综合运动会，规格越来越高，邀请的贵宾和不邀自来的有身份的客人越来越多，甚至有的宾客的妻子儿女也在“邀请”之列。据记者观察，一些应邀到会的客人并没有全心全意地来看体育比赛，在第六届全运会期间，有人借机巡游深圳、珠海、海南岛；在城运会期间，有人远足曲阜、泰山、黄河桥；在乌鲁木齐举行的少数民族运动会期间，有人扁舟天池，赏目天山；在首届青少年运动会期间，有人穿梭在古都开封、洛阳之间。这些人都是请来的宾客，主办单位当然不好怠慢，只能为他们派车辆、订机票，安排食宿，忙得不可开交，还得从赛会的有限经费中支付这些不应支付的费用。
    当然也有些被邀请者碍于情面，不得不放下手头的工作而赴会，主办者又何必勉为其难呢？
    至于全国体总、中国奥委会的领导，原本就是体育界的官员，如赛会需要其参与领导工作，组织工作，应该以工作人员的名义参加，也不必去当“贵宾”。国内比赛公费邀请贵宾（实际是内宾）“观摩”，这在经费有限的情况下并不可取。
