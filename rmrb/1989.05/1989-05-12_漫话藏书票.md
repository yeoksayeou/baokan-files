Title: A Casual Talk on Ex Libris

The "1989 Shanghai International Ex Libris Invitational Exhibition" has attracted widespread attention both domestically and internationally. The author visited the main organizer of this exhibition, Yang Keyang, one of the pioneers of ex libris in China.

Mr. Yang said that his involvement with ex libris was purely accidental. Hong Kong held a "Shanghai Book Fair," and Mr. Yang, who was then one of the leaders of the Shanghai People's Fine Arts Publishing House and also a printmaker, was invited to carve an ex libris as a small gift for the book fair. This was Mr. Yang's first ex libris, and since then, he has been interested in ex libris.

He said that ex libris originated in Europe in the 15th century and was introduced to China in the 1930s. Enthusiastic promoters included Ye Lingfeng, Yu Dafu, and Zheng Zhenzhao, but they mainly wrote articles to promote it. Creation began in 1935, when the first batch of print ex libris appeared in the 9th issue of the hand-printed "Modern Printmaking" (now housed in the Shanghai Lu Xun Memorial Hall). However, it did not become popular and was instead neglected for half a century. It only became popular in recent years, especially with the favor of both old and new printmakers, forming a rapid creation and appreciation group, with creation and research organizations spread across the country. The national organization "Chinese Ex Libris Research Society" has also formally joined the "International Ex Libris Collectors Association." This time, Shanghai hosted an international invitational exhibition, with participating countries numbering in the teens. Italy regrettably did not participate because their works arrived late. Mr. Yang said that in the invitational exhibition, 89 Chinese artists and 122 foreign artists participated, with four-tenths of the thousand works being foreign, showcasing a variety of styles and strong artistic personalities, indeed broadening our horizons.

In foreign ex libris associations, there are not only creators but also collectors and appreciators. For example, the Czech ex libris association has 600 members, one-third of whom are creators, and two-thirds are collectors. In China's ex libris association, this aspect is not yet open enough. Mr. Yang also heard that in Europe, ex libris enthusiasts have close relationships, and when they know you are a fellow enthusiast, they will warmly welcome you.

Since ex libris needs to be reproduced in multiple copies, it is generally done through printmaking. In China, most are woodcuts, while abroad, they also like to use copperplate, screen printing, and lithography. The largest size of the artwork does not exceed 10 centimeters square, hence it is also called "miniature (micro) printmaking." Printmaking once flourished in China under the leadership of Mr. Lu Xun, but in recent years, it has not been as popular. Especially as a form of art that is popular among the masses, it has lost its audience, and many printmakers have switched to Chinese painting and other forms. Since ex libris became popular, printmaking has once again been appreciated by the masses. The public opinion says, "Printmaking is shrinking, but the audience is expanding." Yang Keyang has dedicated himself to printmaking art for decades and believes that ex libris is not a "trivial skill." As long as the masses love it, it shows that printmakers have a lot to do in this small world, which is beneficial for the popularization and prosperity of printmaking. Additionally, ex libris is also an outward-looking form of painting, beneficial for international cultural exchange. If cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou open international ex libris markets, famous artists accept overseas ex libris commissions, and prestigious workshops like Rongbaozhai and Duoyuncuan meticulously reproduce them, accumulating little by little, these small ex libris can also help increase the country's foreign exchange earnings.

　　漫话藏书票
    姚荣铨
    “１９８９年上海国际藏书票邀请展”在海内外引起广泛注目，笔者登门造访了这次展览的主要组织者，我国藏书票积极创导者之一的杨可扬先生。
    杨先生说自己与藏书票结下了不解之缘纯属偶然。香港举办“上海书展”，杨先生原是上海人民美术出版社的负责人之一，又是版画家，被邀请刻一枚藏书票给书展作馈赠的袖珍礼品。这是杨先生刻制藏书票的处女作，从此藏书票引起了他的兴趣。
    据他说，藏书票是１５世纪在欧洲兴起的。传入我国盖在本世纪３０年代，热心介绍者中有叶灵凤、郁达夫、郑振铎等，但他们限于撰文鼓吹。创作则始于１９３５年，在１９３５年发表的手拓本《现代版画》第９集上出现了第一批版画藏书票（现藏上海鲁迅纪念馆）。但是，并没有热起来，相反是冷落了半个世纪。真正热起来是在最近几年，特别是受到新老版画家普遍青睐，创作群和欣赏群迅猛形成，创作研究组织遍及全国各省市。作为全国性的组织“中国藏书票研究会”也已正式加入了“国际藏书票爱好者联盟”。此次上海举办国际邀请展，与会国家有十几个，意大利因为作品寄来迟了一步遗憾地未曾参展。杨先生说，邀请展中，参展的中国画家８９人，外国画家１２２人，在千枚作品中十分之四是外国作品，其风格之多样及其强烈的艺术个性，确实使我们大开了眼界。
    在国外藏书票协会中不仅有创作者还有收藏和欣赏者，像捷克斯洛伐克的藏书票协会中有６００个会员，三分之一是作者，三分之二倒是收藏者。我国的藏书票协会中在这方面还不够开放。杨先生还听说，在欧洲藏书票爱好者相互关系相当密切，当知道你是同好者会热情接待。
    由于藏书票要复制多份，所以一般以版画为之。我国多数是木刻，国外还喜欢用铜版、丝网、石版等。其画面最大也不超过１０厘米见方，故有人称之谓“迷你（微型）版画”。版画曾经在鲁迅先生创导下在中国兴盛起来，但是近年来不那么吃香了，特别是版画作为群众性强的画种竟丧失了群众，版画家为之苦恼，不少版画家也跳槽搞国画和其他画种了。自从藏书票风行起来，版画又为群众所喜闻乐见了，舆论界谓之“版画在缩小，观众在扩大”。杨可扬致力版画艺术数十载，他认为藏书票并非“雕虫小技”，只要群众喜爱，正说明版画家在这个方寸天地里大有文章可做，有利于版画的普及和繁荣。另外，藏书票也是一种外向型的绘画品种，有益于国际文化交流。如果北京、上海、广州诸城市开辟藏书票国际市场，名家挂牌接受海外藏书票订制，由荣宝斋、朵云轩等精工复印，积少成多，小小藏书票对于增加国家外汇收入也是有好处的。
