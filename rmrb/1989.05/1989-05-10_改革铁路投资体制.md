Reforming the Railway Investment System

I believe that while implementing a policy of preferential investment in railways, it is also necessary to reform the railway investment system and financing methods.

The main body of railway investment should be decentralized, enabling construction funds to be raised at different levels. National or Ministry of Railways should be the main investors for trunk lines and hubs in the network, responsible for raising funds and bearing the investment risks and responsibilities. General trunk lines and branch lines that primarily serve local economic development should be built with local investment, with appropriate subsidies from the national government or the Ministry of Railways. Branch lines and dedicated lines serving specific departments and enterprises should be invested in by those departments and enterprises.

This approach can align investment decision-making, responsibility, and benefits, resolving the contradiction of insufficient national financial resources and attracting substantial non-budget funds to accelerate the construction of the "bottleneck" railway industry.

The state should issue railway construction bonds as special funds to accelerate railway development through measures such as financial subsidies, bank low-interest loans, low or tax-exempt projects after completion, and subsidies. Meanwhile, before railway prices are adjusted, it should be allowed to levy a surcharge for road construction in transportation fees to supplement railway construction funds.

Issuing stocks to raise funds for railway construction. Railway investment is large and the cycle is long. Relying solely on state investment or self-accumulation to develop railways is difficult to break out of the current situation. In new construction or reconstruction of old lines, a shareholding system can be tried, issuing stocks to raise funds for construction. However, these lines must implement special freight rates for dedicated lines. The current distorted railway freight rates result in minimal enterprise profits, making it difficult to find buyers for issued stocks.

Utilizing foreign capital, overseas Chinese funds, and World Bank loans for railway construction. Attracting these funds requires the formulation of corresponding laws, policies, and measures to protect their interests, improve the profitability of railway funds, enhance repayment capacity, and further improve the external environment and perfect the investment insurance system.

　　改革铁路投资体制
    铁道部科学研究院  万香琴
    我认为在对铁路实行倾斜投资的同时，还必须改革铁路投资体制和融资方式。
    铁路投资主体分层次下移，使建设资金分层次筹集。路网性的骨干线路、枢纽，由国家或铁道部作为投资主体，筹集资金并承担投资责任和风险。主要为发展地方经济服务的一般干线、支线，由地方投资修建，国家或铁道部给予适当补助。为部门、企业服务的支线，专用线，则由部门和企业作为投资主体。
    这样可以使投资决策、责任和效益结合，既解决了国家财力不足的矛盾，又可大力吸引预算外资金，加快铁路“瓶颈”产业的建设。
    国家通过财政贴息、银行低息或项目投产后低税或免税、补贴等措施发行铁路建设债券，作为加快铁路发展的专项基金。同时，在铁路价格未理顺前，应允许铁路在运输费用中附加征收集资修路费，补足铁路建设资金。
    发行股票筹资修路。铁路投资大、周期长，单由国家投资或依靠自身积累发展铁路，很难摆脱困境。在铁路资金增量中，即新建或改造旧线建设中可试行股份制，发行股票筹资建路。但是这些线路必须实行专线特殊运价。现行铁路运价扭曲企业微利，发行股票也难找到买主。
    利用外资、侨资、世界银行贷款修路。吸收这些资金，要求制定相应的法律、政策和措施，保证其权益，提高铁路资金利润率，增加还贷能力，还必须进一步改善外部环境，完善投资保险制度等。
