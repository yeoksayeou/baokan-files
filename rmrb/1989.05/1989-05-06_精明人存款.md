"Money not only can 'reproduce,' but it also has a very strong 'breeding' ability. It's still better to save money!" This is what a resident of a small town said.

After multiple fluctuations in prices, many people in some places have changed: they no longer rush to buy things along with others, but instead think about how to cope. Participating in value-preserving savings is one of the strategies. A resident calculated the following: if you save 1,000 yuan for a three-year term, and roll over the principal and interest continuously for five terms, if the interest rate and value-preserving supplements remain at the current level, you can get over 17,000 yuan in principal and interest after 15 years. Those who are impatient rush to buy, while the smart ones save money. Not long ago, relevant departments in Jiamusi City, Heilongjiang Province conducted a detailed survey of 100 households, and two-thirds of the residents expressed their intention to save the increased income in the bank to earn interest.

　　精明人存款
    “钱不但能‘下崽’，而且还有很强的‘繁殖’能力。还是存钱合算！”这是一位小镇居民说的话。
    经过物价的多次波动，许多地方的一些群众在变：不再跟着别人抢购，而是想着如何对付的办法。参加保值储蓄就是其中的一招。有位居民算了这笔帐：把１０００元以三年为一期，本息连续转存５次，如利息和保值贴补保持现有水平，１５年后可得本利１．７万元以上。性急者抢购，精明者存款。不久前黑龙江佳木斯市有关部门对百户居民作详细调查，其中２／３的居民表示要把增加的收入存入银行生息。
