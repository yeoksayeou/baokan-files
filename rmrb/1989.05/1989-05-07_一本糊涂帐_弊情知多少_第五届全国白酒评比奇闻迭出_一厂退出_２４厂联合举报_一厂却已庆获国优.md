A Messy Account: How Much Corruption is There?

The Fifth National White Liquor Evaluation: Strange Incidents Continue to Emerge
One Factory Withdraws, 24 Factories Jointly Report, One Factory Already Celebrates Winning National Excellence

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 7 (Reporter Yang Like) The fifth national white liquor evaluation is still a messy account, but the "strange incidents" related to this matter continue to emerge: there are factories declaring withdrawal from the evaluation; there are factories jointly reporting the inside story; there are factories celebrating in advance for winning national excellence.

Materials forwarded by relevant departments prove that the fifth national white liquor evaluation indeed has many situations that outsiders are not aware of.

Sichuan Wenchun Wine Factory issued a public statement on April 27: to withdraw from the fifth national white liquor evaluation. The factory stated in the announcement that their factory is a famous wine factory in Sichuan, a provincial advanced enterprise, and a civilized unit, with an annual tax revenue of 13.5 million yuan and an annual export earnings of 300,000 US dollars. As early as 1923, Wenchun Wine won the quality award from the Sichuan Provincial Promotion Association, consecutively winning the title of "Sichuan Famous Wine" and the Golden Cup Award from the Ministry of Commerce, and in 1988, it also won the gold medal at the 13th International Food Exhibition in Paris. This factory clearly stated that their factory has entered the final of the fifth white liquor evaluation, but considering the disorderly evaluation order and process, this evaluation blurs the line between good and bad, and damages social ethics, they decided to withdraw and let the general consumers supervise the product quality.

On April 13, 24 wine factories from Yunnan, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, Heilongjiang, Shandong, and other provinces jointly wrote a letter to report that the fifth national white liquor evaluation was full of fraud and nepotism. In the report, they listed five issues: first, before the evaluation, the China Food Association had strict regulations on various physicochemical indicators, output, production volume, and comprehensive quality management of the products to be evaluated, but these regulations were not followed during the evaluation; second, the evaluation procedure was not strict, and after the semi-final, some white liquors that were eliminated were arbitrarily selected to enter the final with the winners; third, the issue of alcohol evaluators' grouping, it was announced before the evaluation meeting that evaluators could not participate in the evaluation of white liquors of their own factory's aroma type, but an evaluator from a factory in Henan participated in the evaluation of their own factory's aroma type throughout the evaluation; fourth, the confidentiality of alcohol evaluation was not strict. The alcohol sample code should be absolutely confidential, but before the evaluation, the grouping numbers were leaked to the insiders, some factories were looking for relationships and seeking help, secretly bribing; fifth, there was a pre-determined behavior in this alcohol evaluation. Therefore, these factories called for the disclosure of the original basis of the evaluation activities, to cut off the relationships that have entered the evaluation work, to rectify the party style, and to rectify the social ethics.

The results of the fifth national white liquor evaluation have not been announced yet, but a wine factory in Luoyang, Henan, has already been celebrating in the streets and alleys of Luoyang for winning the "national excellence." On large banners and balloons, it is written in big letters, warmly congratulating their factory's high and low-degree wines for winning the third and fourth places in the fifth national white liquor evaluation. It is really unclear how this factory's third and fourth places were obtained, which makes people associate this evaluation work with chaos and confusion.

　　一本糊涂帐　弊情知多少    
    第五届全国白酒评比奇闻迭出 
    一厂退出　２４厂联合举报　一厂却已庆获国优
    新华社北京５月７日电  （记者杨理科）第五届全国白酒评比至今还是一本糊涂帐，但关于这件事的“奇闻”却迭出不穷：有厂家声明退出评比；有厂家联名举报内幕；有厂家预先庆获国优。
    有关部门转来的材料证明，第五届全国白酒评比确有许多外人不了解的情况。
    四川省文君酒厂，于４月２７日发表公开声明：退出第五届全国白酒评比行列。这家酒厂在声明中说，他们厂系四川名酒厂、省先进企业和文明单位，年创利税１３５０万元，年出口创汇额达３０万美元。早在１９２３年文君酒就荣获四川省劝业会优质奖章，蝉联历届“四川省名酒”称号和商业部金爵奖，１９８８年又荣膺巴黎第１３届国际食品博览会金奖。这家酒厂明确声明，他们酒厂已进入第五届白酒评比的决赛，但鉴于评比秩序及评比过程的混乱，这种评比混淆了优劣界线，败坏了社会风气，决定退出，让广大消费者监督产品质量。
    云南、贵州、内蒙古、黑龙江、山东等２４个酒厂４月１３日联合写信，举报第五届白酒评比弄虚作假、营私舞弊。他们在举报材料中列举了５个问题：一是评比前中国食品协会对参评产品的各项理化指标及产值、产量、全面质量管理都有严格规定，但评比中没按原规定办事；二是评比程序不严密，在进行半决赛后，又擅自从被淘汰的白酒中挑出部分白酒与优胜者一起进入决赛；三是评酒员分组问题，评比会前宣布：评委不能参与本厂所属香型酒的评比，但河南有个酒厂的评委却始终参加本厂香型酒的评比；四是评酒保密不严。酒样密码本应是绝密的，可在评比之前就把分组编号透给了关系户，有的厂家四处找关系网，求人帮忙，暗地行贿；五是这次评酒有事先内定行为。为此，这些厂家呼吁公布评比活动的原始依据，斩断伸进评比工作中的关系，正党风，正社会风气。
    第五届全国白酒评比结果至今未揭晓，河南伊川的一家酒厂竟在洛阳市的大街小巷庆贺喜获“国优”活动。在大幅横标和气球飘带上写出大字，热烈祝贺本厂的高、低度酒分别获得第五届全国白酒评比第３名和第４名。实在不清楚，这家酒厂的第３名和第４名是如何获得的？不由人联想起这届评酒工作的混乱和糊涂。
