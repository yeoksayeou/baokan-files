On March 1st, workers at the Daxinggou Forestry Bureau's wood-plastic products factory were busy at work when suddenly a scream echoed through the workshop. The workers rushed over to find that a female worker had four of her fingers caught in the machinery.

How did this accident happen? It turns out that the female worker was operating a machine that produces packaging straps. As she fed the raw materials into the machine, her ring got caught, pulling her hand into the machinery and severing four of her fingers. This tragic accident was caused by a small ring.

In Guangzhou, home burglaries have been on the rise. Statistics show that in 1987, the number of home burglaries in the city increased by 24.3% compared to 1986, and in 1988, the number increased by another 16%. In the first two months of this year, the increase has been even more significant. The primary targets of these burglaries are residential households, but there have also been some cases involving individual shops and government agencies.
