Linguistic experts in the capital have issued a warning today: if we allow classical Chinese, traditional Chinese characters, and regional dialects to proliferate unchecked, our nation's efforts in language standardization will be in vain.

At a symposium commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, jointly organized by the Beijing Language Society and the Chinese Language Department of Renmin University of China, several linguists and university professors involved in language education pointed out: the promotion of vernacular literature and the National Language Movement were significant components of the May Fourth Movement. From the perspective of modernizing language, commemorating the May Fourth Movement means doing a good job in standardizing spoken and written language. However, in recent years, there has been a serious retrogressive trend in the language field, with classical Chinese and traditional characters on the rise. Non-standard language is rampant in movies, novels, and mass media. Today, as the Chinese language is going global, the chaotic state of domestic language use is worrying.

　　语言界复古倾向堪忧    
    专家呼吁使用规范语言
    本报北京５月８日讯  今天，首都语言专家向人们发出了警告：若听任文言文、繁体字及地方话泛滥，我们民族语言的规范化工作会前功尽弃。
    在北京市语言学会与中国人民大学语文系联合举办的纪念五四运动７０周年座谈会上，一些语言专家和从事语言教育的大学教授们指出：白话文、国语运动是当年“五四运动”的重要组成部分，从语文现代化的角度纪念“五四运动”就是要做好口语、书面语言的规范化工作。但是，近年来语言界复古倾向严重，文言文、繁体字有抬头趋势，电影、小说、大众传播媒介中不规范语言充斥。在汉语走向世界的今天，国内语言运用的混乱状况令人忧虑。　　　　　（陈明）
