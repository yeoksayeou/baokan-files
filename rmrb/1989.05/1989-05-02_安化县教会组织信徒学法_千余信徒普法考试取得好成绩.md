The Christian church in Anhua County, Hunan Province, has made organizing believers to study the law an important part of their religious activities. Over the past five years, more than a thousand believers in the county have all followed the law and maintained good conduct.

Since the Christian church in Anhua County resumed normal religious activities in 1980, it has established twelve preaching sites and churches across the county, with a total of 1,050 male and female believers. Every Saturday or Sunday, believers gather at their respective sites and churches. They first study the law according to the plan, then sing hymns and preach the scriptures. During the law-study activities, the church provides each believer with a copy of "Selected Laws" and prints out some legal materials and relevant state policy provisions. The church also organizes preaching pastors and site managers to attend "Universal Law" cadre training classes every February, inviting lawyers from the county's legal advisory office to give lectures. Many believers also study legal knowledge seriously at home.

Due to their diligent study of the law, the believers achieved an average score of 88.5 in the county's "Universal Law" assessment exam last December. Believer Huang Liping scored full marks and ranked first individually in the county.

　　安化县教会组织信徒学法    
    千余信徒普法考试取得好成绩
    本报讯  湖南省安化县基督教会把组织信徒学法作为宗教活动的一项重要内容，五年来，该县一千余名信徒人人遵纪守法。
    安化县基督教会一九八○年恢复正常宗教活动以来，先后在全县各地设有传教堂、点十二个，共有男女信徒一千零五十人。每当礼拜六或礼拜日时，信徒们集合在各自的堂、点，首先按计划学习法律，然后再唱赞美诗和传经讲道。在学法活动中，教会发给每个信徒一本《法律选编》，并翻印了部分法律资料和国家有关政策条文。教会还于每年二月组织传教士和各堂点负责人参加“普法”骨干培训班，聘请县法律顾问处的律师上辅导课。不少信徒回到家里还认真学习法律知识。
    由于虔诚学法，信徒们在去年十二月全县“普法”验收考试中，取得了平均八十八点五分的好成绩，信徒黄立平得了满分，名列全县个人第一名。
