The city of Xiangfan in Hubei Province, which had a funding gap of 250 million yuan this year, has created and promoted a dual-line management method for funds. This method encourages the government, banks, and enterprises to abandon the mindset of relying on higher authorities for loans and instead focus on internal efforts. As a result, the tight funding situation has somewhat eased. According to incomplete statistics, the city has activated over 50 million yuan in funds in the first quarter.

Previously, credit funds were mainly managed by banks in a "single-line" system, while administrative departments focused on seeking more loans from higher authorities rather than managing existing funds effectively, leading to poor utilization of funds. This year, the city has promoted the experience of dual-line management from Gucheng County, changing from single-line management by banks to a dual-line system of "quota control and contract management" by both banks and the government.

Xiangfan's specific approach includes two main steps. First, jointly determining the loan quotas for enterprises. Enterprises are classified based on their economic performance, and specific loan quotas are set accordingly. Enterprises with good economic performance are given priority for loans, while those with poor performance receive fewer or no loans.

Second, signing dual-line fund supply contracts. Banks, in accordance with the requirement to accelerate the turnover of working capital by 4% and activate 200 million yuan of funds across the city, sign loan contracts with enterprises and their supervising departments. The municipal government also signs administrative responsibility letters with county governments, breaking down tasks and assigning them to enterprise supervising departments.

The implementation of dual-line management for funds in Xiangfan has improved the financial environment and promoted the adjustment of credit and industrial structures.

　　政府银行合作　管好用活贷款    
    襄樊推广资金双线承包   
    一季度盘活资金五千多万元
    本报讯  今年全市资金缺口达２．５亿元的湖北省襄樊市，由于创造、推广了资金承包双线管理办法，促使政府、银行和企业丢掉期望上级开口子的思想，向内使劲，资金紧缺的局面有所缓和。据不完全统计，全市一季度已盘活的资金达５０００余万元。
    过去，信贷资金主要由银行“单线”负责管理，行政部门只想伸手向上多要贷款，却忽视对现有资金的管理，资金使用效益差。今年以来这个市推广谷城县资金承包双线管理经验，变银行单线管理，为银行和政府两条线“限额控制，承包管理”，双管齐下。
    襄樊市的具体做法，一是共同核定企业贷款限额。根据经济效益好坏对企业分类排队，具体核定企业贷款额度，经济效益好的企业贷款给以优先，差的少给或不给贷款。
    二是双线签定资金供应合同。银行按照流动资金周转加速４％、全市盘活２亿资金的要求，同企业主管部门和企业签定贷款合同，市政府也同县政府签定行政首长责任状，把任务分解落实到企业主管部门。
    襄樊市推行资金承包双线管理，改良了金融环境，促进了信贷结构和产业结构的调整。
