In outdoor operations or during outdoor transportation and storage of goods, tarpaulins are indispensable. Traditional waxed tarpaulins can repel rain but are flammable, leading to significant fire-related losses annually. Recently, Changzhou City's Forward Special Composite Materials Factory in Jiangsu Province has successfully developed a new type of tarpaulin that is both fire-resistant and waterproof.

The factory's newly developed fire-resistant five-proof tarpaulin offers five functions: fire resistance, waterproofing, acid and alkali resistance, UV protection, and cold resistance. Its fire-resistant performance meets the difficult-to-burn grade one standard (oxygen index of 31°), and it can self-extinguish within 10 seconds of being removed from a fire source. It can be used in temperatures as low as -40°C without cracking when folded, and it does not stick at temperatures up to 100°C. During the rainy season, it does not mold, is non-toxic, and can be used to cover food. This tarpaulin has a uniform color, is smooth and glossy, can be folded, is lightweight, and can be widely used in outdoor storage yards, stations, docks, vehicle and ship transportation, tents, and mailbags. It can also be used as coverings for outdoor machinery, aircraft, tanks, and artillery, and can be made into fire-resistant and waterproof workwear.

    防火防水篷布试制成功
    本报讯  在露天作业或露天运输、存放货物的场所，离不开遮盖篷布。传统的油蜡篷布能防雨却易燃，每年由此引起的火灾损失惊人。最近，江苏省常州市前进特种复合材料厂试制成一种既防水又防火的新型篷布。
    该厂试制的阻燃五防篷布具有防火、防水、防酸碱、防晒、防寒五种功能。其阻燃性能达到难燃一级（氧指数为31°），离开火源10秒钟即能自行熄灭。它能在零下40℃的低温使用对折不破裂，能在100℃高温使用不发粘，在雨季不发霉，自身无毒性，可用于遮盖食物。这种篷布色泽均匀、平整光洁、可折迭、轻便，可广泛用于露天仓囤、车站码头、车船运输、帐篷、邮包，可用于露天机械设备和飞机、坦克、火炮的盖布，还可用来制作防火防水的工作服。
