Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 30th

According to a report by the *Washington Post* today, U.S. Secretary of State James Baker will propose a new round of strategic arms talks during his visit to Moscow in May.

The report cited an official in Washington as saying that the U.S. proposes to hold the talks in June this year.

Negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to reduce their respective nuclear arsenals by 30% were suspended last November after Bush was elected president. In recent times, the Soviet side has repeatedly complained that the U.S. has been delaying the formulation of a negotiating strategy.

The report revealed that the U.S. government is studying the possibility of changing its negotiating stance. Secretary of State Baker had previously said in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that President Bush hopes to advance the progress made in the negotiations between the previous Reagan administration and the Soviet Union.

The new chief of staff of the Joint Armed Forces of the Warsaw Pact, General Lobov, today published an article in *Red Star* accusing the United States and NATO of "still seeking military superiority, formulating plans for aggression, and strengthening the material basis for launching surprise attacks."

In his article, Lobov also complained that the United States and NATO have responded "coldly" to the Warsaw Pact's proposals for arms reductions, continuing to strengthen their military capabilities according to their theories of "direct confrontation" and "flexible response." He believes that NATO only wants to reduce the Warsaw Pact's tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles, but does not want to reduce its own superior tactical attack aircraft, armed helicopters, carrier-based aircraft, and amphibious equipment.

Observers noted that Lobov published this article on the eve of the resumption of negotiations between the Warsaw Pact and NATO on the reduction of conventional arms in Europe, scheduled for May 5 in Vienna.

　　美将建议重开战略武器谈判    
    华约指责北约谋求军事优势
    新华社华盛顿４月３０日电  据《华盛顿邮报》今天报道，美国国务卿贝克将在５月访问莫斯科期间，向苏联提出有关进行新的一轮战略武器谈判的建议。
    该报援引华盛顿的一名官员的话说，美国建议谈判于今年６月举行。
    美苏双方关于将各自核武库削减３０％的谈判于去年１１月布什当选总统后中止了。近一段时间来，苏联方面一直抱怨美国在制订谈判策略方面拖延时间。
    据该报透露，美国政府正在对可能改变它们谈判立场进行研究。贝克国务卿曾经在参议院外交委员会的一次听证会上说，布什总统希望推进前里根政府同苏联谈判中所得的进展。
    新华社莫斯科４月２９日电　华沙条约组织联合武装部队新任参谋长洛博夫大将今天在《红星报》发表文章，指责美国和北约“仍然在谋求军事优势，制订侵略计划，加强发动突然袭击的物质基础”。
    洛博夫在文章中还抱怨，美国和北约组织对华约提出的裁军建议“反应冷淡”，继续按照其“直接对抗”和“灵活反应”的理论加强军备。他认为北约只想削减华约的坦克、大炮和装甲车，而不想减少自己占优势的战术攻击机、武装直升机、舰载飞机和水陆两用装备。
    观察家注意到，洛博夫是在华约和北约于５月５日在维也纳恢复关于削减欧洲常规军备谈判的前夕发表这篇文章的。
