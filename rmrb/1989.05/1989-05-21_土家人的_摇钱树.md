In Zhangjiajie, there is a "money tree." At the entrance to Nantianmen, it stands about 35 feet tall and 2-3 feet in circumference, robust and towering, with a dark brown color. According to the guide, the fruit this tree bears in autumn resembles coins, round with a square hole in the middle. Visitors flock to pick them up as symbols of wealth and good fortune. The guide mysteriously adds that, according to scientists, there is currently no second "money tree" discovered in China.

In fact, the entire Zhangjiajie is the "money tree" of Xiangxi, the "money tree" of the Tujia people.

Currently, there are over 4 million Tujia people nationwide, with over 1 million residing in Xiangxi. This region is characterized by abundant rainfall, dense forests, high mountains, and long rivers. Did the ancestors of the Tujia people choose this land blessed by nature, or was it long-term ethnic oppression and warfare that drove the Tujia people to this southern malarial region? This is a question for historians and scientists to investigate. However, whether the Tujia people's settlement in Xiangxi is a blessing or a curse, and what the future holds, today we seem to have an answer.

The answer lies in Zhangjiajie.

Zhangjiajie is China's first national forest park. The forest coverage rate is over 92%. There are nearly 500 species of woody plants, including nearly 200 species of trees; there are also many animals, including rare species such as the water pheasant, pheasant, red-billed blue magpie, musk deer, macaques, flying tigers, and the Chinese giant salamander, all of which can be seen here. Zhangjiajie has an average annual temperature of around 16 degrees Celsius, with an annual rainfall of 1,200-1,600 millimeters and a frost-free period of 240-300 days. The unique blessings of nature have made this place a green treasure trove and a natural zoo.

The primary colors of Zhangjiajie, besides the clear water and green trees, are the gray, white, black, brown, and variously colored towering peaks and strange rocks. What do mountains look like? In most people's minds, they are just high outlines, like a big mound or a big steamed bun. The mountains of Zhangjiajie are not like that. They are like upright swords ready to be drawn, like unfinished towering walls of copper and iron, like pillars supporting the southern land, with sharp edges and rugged lines, as if they were just carved by the gods. The majesty of "Huangshi Fortress," the seclusion of "Jinbian Stream," the danger of "Yaozi Fortress," the wonder of "Chaotian Observatory," and the wildness of "Shadan Valley"—the strange peaks and rocks are countless, and the scenery is breathtaking. It is truly "a new scene every five steps, a new world every ten steps." Take "Jinbian Stream" for example. The Jinbian Rock standing in front of it is over 300 meters high. Legend has it that Qin Shi Huang placed his "herding whip" here. Upon closer inspection, it makes sense. The rock group in front of it, like a thousand horses galloping, is not rushing towards the sea? Some people praise Zhangjiajie for combining the wonders of Huangshan, the dangers of Huashan, the elegance of Emei, and the beauty of Guilin, "fusing the beauty of the world into one furnace," which is indeed true!

In fact, what people see of Zhangjiajie today is only a tiny part of the entire scenic area. There are still countless mysterious and strange places waiting to be developed and discovered.

The development of the Zhangjiajie scenic area is all thanks to the reform and opening up. Therefore, there are many scenic spots here, but few historical sites.

Of course, there are some ancient things. On the tourist hotspot—climbing "Huangshi Fortress"—there are many blackened traces of smoke under the protruding rocks, and some stone mortars for pounding rice are still embedded in the rock crevices. This is evidence that the Tujia people once lived here, and it is also proof of the hardships and difficulties faced by the people in this area.

After people's living standards improved, exploring deep mountains and dense forests has become a joy and an enjoyment. However, before the area was developed as a tourist spot, when transportation was poor and goods were scarce, the Tujia people living here, besides enjoying the cheap spring water and air provided by nature, found everything else difficult. The higher the mountains, the more dangerous the roads, the more difficult the life, nothing else!

After the development of the Zhangjiajie scenic area, the Tujia people were the first to benefit. According to the management office, the two villages they manage—Zhangjiajie and Yuanjiajie—have seen their per capita annual income rise from less than 200 yuan to over 600 yuan. The corn grown in the terraced fields on the mountain yields 200 jin per mu, which, at 3 jiao per jin, is worth 60 yuan. Now, selling the green corn cobs to tourists at 2 jiao each, with 4,000 cobs per mu, the income is 800 yuan. This is the benefit that the development of Zhangjiajie has brought to the Tujia people, from 60 yuan to 800 yuan.

The honest Tujia people now also know how to do business. At various tourist spots and along the mountain paths, one can see people selling local specialties, medicinal herbs, and handicrafts. Although they are not as shrewd as the city "speculators" (who sell hard-boiled eggs with red shells for 2 yuan per jin, but after cooking, only sell them for 2.5 jiao each), they have indeed learned that, besides hunting, making charcoal, and clearing land, there is another way to make money.

The Tujia people have great respect and nostalgia for Xiang Dakun. This peasant leader led the Tujia people in a struggle against the government during the Ming Hongwu period and later died in battle at Shentan Bay in Sangzhi County. Xiang Dakun, known as Xiang Tianzi, died at a place now called Tianzi Mountain, and the Tianzi Mountain tourist area has also been opened. The founding hero of the People's Republic, Marshal He Long, was also from Sangzhi, so the "He Long Park" is built on Tianzi Mountain. Two historical giants emerged from the same place, Tianzi Mountain, and returned to Tianzi Mountain from different directions, which is a source of pride for the Tujia people but also a source of sadness.

Tianzi Mountain is about 30 kilometers away from Zhangjiajie. When we arrived at Tianzi Mountain, a very delicate-looking Tujia girl greeted us. Everyone thought she was a hotel service staff, but later we found out that she was Peng Lijuan, 19 years old, the contractor of the 200-bed Lan Garden Hotel. The annual contract amount is 700,000 yuan. We asked her how much she could earn in a year. She humorously said, "How much I earn, you'll have to come back next time to find out." We asked her if there were any risks. She said there were. We asked her why she would take the risk. She said, "To make money!" followed by a hearty, clear laugh. Who would have thought that on Tianzi Mountain, there would also be a "strong woman"!

The tall bronze statue of Marshal He Long standing not far away, holding his beloved pipe, is smiling tirelessly at this girl.

### 土家人的“摇钱树”

　　土家人的“摇钱树”
    本报记者  吴昊
    张家界有一棵“摇钱树”，在南天门入口处，高三五丈，粗二三围，“雄劲”，挺拔，呈黑褐色。据导游介绍，这棵树秋天结的果实其状如钱，圆圆的，中间有方孔。游人到此，争相拾取，作为发财交好运的吉祥物。导游神秘地说：据科学家考察，在我国，“摇钱树”目前还没有发现第二棵。
    其实，整个张家界就是湘西的摇钱树，就是土家族人的摇钱树。
    目前，全国共有土家族人４００余万，聚居在湘西的有１００余万。这里雨多林密，山高水长，是土家人的祖先选中了这块得天独厚的土地，还是长期以来的民族压迫和民族战争把土家人赶到了这南国的瘴疠之地？有待于史学家和科学家们去考证。但土家人定居在湘西，是福？是祸？以后前景如何？今天看来，已经有了答案。
    答案就在张家界。
    张家界是我国第一个森林公园。森林覆盖率在９２％以上。木本植物有近百科５００余种，其中乔木近２００种；动物也较多，其中珍贵动物如背水鸡、锦鸡、红嘴相思鸟、麝、猕猴、飞虎、娃娃鱼，在这里都可以看到。张家界年平均气温１６摄氏度左右，年降雨量１２００—１６００毫米，无霜期２４０—３００天，大自然的特殊恩惠，使得这里成为绿色的宝库，天然的动物园。
    张家界的基本色彩，除了清清的水和绿绿的树之外，主要是灰色的、白色的、黑色的、褐色的以及各色相间的、拔地而起的、各种各样的奇峰怪石。山是什么模样？在一般人的脑子里，不过就是高高的轮廓，像个大坟堆，像个大馒头。张家界的山可不是这个样子，它像竖在地上的、引而待发的一把把利剑，像尚未竣工的高耸入云的铜墙铁壁，像支撑南国大地的擎天柱，那凌厉的棱角，那粗犷的线条，就像鬼斧神工刚刚劈开的。“黄狮寨”之雄，“金鞭溪”之幽，“腰子寨”之险，“朝天观”之奇，“砂刀沟”之野，奇峰怪石，鳞次栉比，美不胜收，真是“五步一个景，十步一重天”。就拿“金鞭溪”来说，迎面而立的金鞭岩，高３００余米，传说是秦始皇把“赶山鞭”定在这里了。仔细琢磨，确有道理。此岩前面那万马奔腾的石群，不是正在匆匆然争相奔向大海吗！有人称赞张家界兼有黄山之奇、华山之险、峨眉之秀、桂林之美，“融天下美景于一炉”，信然！
    其实，目前人们所看到的张家界，不过是整个风景区的一点点，等待人们去开发和认识的，不知还有多少神奇诡秘的地方。
    张家界风景区的开发，全是改革开放以后的事。因此，这里风景甚多，古迹却绝少。
    古的东西当然不是一点没有，就在旅游的热线之一——攀登“黄狮寨”的路上，那伸出的岩石下面，有不少被烟火熏黑的痕迹，有的地方舂米的石臼还镶嵌在石缝中，这是曾经刀耕火种的土家人在这里生活过的证据，也是这一带人艰难困苦的证明。
    在人们生活提高以后，钻深山、爬密林，当然是一种乐事，一种享受。可是在作为旅游区开发之前，交通条件极差、商品极度缺乏的情况下，生活在这里的土家人，除了享受大自然廉价供给的泉水和空气之外，其他什么都是困难的。山越高，路越险，生活越艰难，别而无他！
    张家界风景区开发以后，首先得到实惠的是土家人。据管理处的同志介绍，他们管理的两个寨子——张家界和袁家界，人均年收入已由过去的不足２００元上升到６００多元。山上梯田里种的玉米，亩产２００斤，按三角钱一斤算，值６０元，而今把青玉米棒子卖给游客，一个２角，以一亩地４０００个计，收入８００元，由６０元到８００元，这就是开发张家界给土家人带来的实惠。
    憨厚的土家人如今也已经懂得了做生意。在各个旅游点，在登山的路上，人们随处可以看到卖土特产的，卖药材的，卖工艺品的，他们虽然不像城里的“倒爷”那样精明（两块钱一斤的红皮鸡蛋，煮熟了，也只卖两角五分钱一个），但他们确实懂得了，除打猎、烧炭、开荒之外，还有另一条生财之路。
    土家人对向大坤是十分崇敬和怀念的。这位农民领袖，在明洪武年间曾领导土家人和官府进行过斗争，后来战死在桑植县的神堂弯。向大坤人称向天子，他死的地方今称天子山，而今天子山旅游区也已开放。人民共和国的开国元勋贺龙元帅祖籍桑植，因此“贺龙公园”就建在天子山上。两位历史伟人从同一个地方走出天子山，又从不同的方向走回天子山，是土家人的骄傲，也使土家人感到悲痛。
    天子山离张家界３０余公里。在我们到达天子山的时候，一个长相十分秀气的土家族妹子迎上来和我们打招呼，大家都以为她是宾馆的服务员，后来才知道，她叫彭丽珍，今年１９岁，是２００多张床位的兰园宾馆的承包人。承包金额年上缴７万元。我们问她一年下来能挣多少？她幽默地说：“赚多少，你下次来才能告诉你。”我们问她有无风险？她说有。问她为什么要担风险？她说：“想赚钱呗！”接着是一阵爽朗清脆的笑声。想不到吧！在这天子山上居然也有了“女强人”。
    竖立在不远处的贺龙元帅的高大铜像，拿着他那心爱的烟斗，对着这位妹子，在不知疲倦地微笑着。
