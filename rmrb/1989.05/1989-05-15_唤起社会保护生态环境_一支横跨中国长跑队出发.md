Long-distance trekking activities aimed at promoting certain causes and expanding their influence have recently been frequently occurring across the vast expanse of China. A group of young people from Xi'an have decided to organize a "For Tomorrow" long-distance running event to traverse China, with the goal of promoting the protection of nature, the ecological environment, and the rescue of wildlife. This running team, consisting of 11 members, set off from the border town of Sumei Hana in Xinjiang on May 10th. They plan to pass through 10 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, ultimately reaching Fuyuan in Heilongjiang, covering a total distance of over 10,000 kilometers.
