I am a salesperson and often work outside, unable to attend to household matters. My two children and the three mu of contracted land are all managed by my wife alone. Since the three mu of land are divided into seven or eight plots, the farthest being more than a kilometer from home, my wife often takes care of one end but neglects the other. Recently, the township has stipulated that every household must plant tobacco, and those who do not plant tobacco will be fined. If my family does not plant tobacco, we will be fined 129.3 yuan. My family has no labor to plant tobacco, so why should we be fined? I cannot understand this.

　　为何强迫我们种烟
    我是个营业员，经常在外面工作，顾不得家中事情，两个孩子和承包的三亩地全靠妻子一人操持。由于三亩地分成七八块，最远的离家一公里多路，我妻子常常顾了这头，管不了那头。最近，乡里规定家家都要种烟，谁不种烟就要被罚款。我家如不种烟，就要被罚款一百二十九元三角。我家没有劳力种烟，为什么要受罚？对此，我想不通。
