	Gorbachev Speaks at Welcome Banquet
	Sino-Soviet Relations Entering a New Phase

	Respected Chairman Yang Shangkun!
	Respected Comrades, Friends!

	First of all, allow me to express my gratitude to the leaders of the People's Republic of China for inviting us to visit your country and for the warm hospitality we have received during our first few hours in Beijing.

	These days, something extraordinary is happening in the capital of China. Two of the world's largest countries, with a 7,500-kilometer-long common border, have shifted their relations onto a solid and healthy foundation. This is the first meeting between the leaders of our two socialist countries in 30 years.

	This meeting did not come easily; it required wisdom and a sense of responsibility from both sides, as well as persistent efforts to overcome the negative accumulated baggage and prejudices that have weighed heavily on our relations for many years.

	Today, we have reason to say that Sino-Soviet relations are entering a new phase. This is because our two countries have changed, and because the world around us has also changed.

	In the past 10 years, China has shown a new face to the world. The wave of modernization in various aspects of social life in your country is something that the Soviet people feel close to and understand.

	The increasing industrialization, the changes in agricultural production relations, the liberation of the masses' thoughts and initiative, the enrichment of spiritual civilization in Chinese society—all these are the results of bold and far-reaching reforms that have attracted great interest worldwide.

	We hope that the leadership and people of China will successfully solve the problems encountered on this path and achieve stable progress for their socialist motherland.

	You know that great changes are also taking place in our Soviet Union.

	The concept of "reform" accurately reflects the transformation process that our entire society is undergoing. Everything that has delayed and hindered our development and distorted our goals and ideals is being eliminated. At the same time, new state and social mechanisms are being formed, aimed at accelerating progress and fundamentally improving the quality of life for the Soviet people.

	Now, the fundamental reforms advocated by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have become a cause closely related to our working class and all laborers. This is the guarantee of the irreversibility of the reforms and the assurance that our great cause of renewing socialism and fully unleashing its humanitarian and democratic potential will be successfully completed.

	In short, both our countries have taken action. And a feature of the current situation is that other socialist countries have also entered a period of renewal. Socialism is entering a new stage of development, a stage in which its creative potential will be fully unleashed.

	We also see that this process of reform is spreading to more and more countries and is affecting the realm of interstate relations.

	The generations of our contemporary world face a very complex and noble task: to gradually establish a new international order.

	On this path, humanity will encounter many obstacles. The changes that have taken place in the world in recent years and decades are far from simple and uniform.

	Indeed, in many aspects of international life, there are encouraging trends. Regular political dialogues, including those currently involving a broad range of social groups on a multilateral basis, have become an indispensable and very important part of international life. In other words, people's diplomacy is actively promoting and supplementing official diplomacy.

	Initial steps have been taken in the field of disarmament, and there has been a beginning in the political resolution of regional conflicts, which for decades have been one of the main sources of international tension and have repeatedly brought the world to the brink of destruction.

	Trust in interstate relations has increased, and the willingness to cooperate in solving acute global problems has also strengthened.

	However, it is also true that the world remains very fragile and vulnerable. Arsenals still exist, and in some respects, they continue to expand. The renewal of armaments has not stopped, which means that the emergence of new, more powerful weapons cannot be ruled out. The threat of ecological disaster is growing, and nature can no longer bear the pollution caused by technological civilization and urgently needs rescue.

	The problems of overcoming hunger and poverty, and of overcoming the underdevelopment of many countries' economies, remain extremely acute.

	One of the main themes of ancient Chinese philosophy, as in the philosophy and folklore of many other nations, is the struggle between light and darkness, good and evil. It can be said that these two opposing concepts are currently engaged in a particularly irreconcilable struggle.

	Humanity stands at a crossroads. It is precisely in these years that the question must be solved: can humanity take the path of light, can it stop the threats it faces, or will human civilization head towards its end?

	We believe in a good outcome and a bright future. This is not just a good wish but a conviction based on an assessment of the actual processes taking place on the international stage and the enormous capabilities of the political and social forces advocating the maintenance of peace.

	It is clear how great the responsibility is for everyone, especially for those who are authorized to lead the country and make decisions!

	In this situation, every country and every people are considering their place in the world. Four years ago, we began such an in-depth analysis, and with the reforms, the now well-known political new thinking emerged.

	Respected Chinese comrades are familiar with the basic ideas of political new thinking. We are willing to apply it to our relations with China.

	Allow me to use the traditional political vocabulary of your country and express my views on the development of Sino-Soviet relations with "three supports."

	The first "support" is that we support the universally recognized principles in international exchanges: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

	Secondly, we "support" cooperation in the economic and cultural fields and active political dialogue at all levels and in all aspects of the state and society. We are convinced that such cooperation is beneficial to the peoples of the two countries and will help them more smoothly achieve the major goals they have set for themselves.

	Finally, we "support" mutual cooperation between our two countries in solving urgent international problems. Of course, the Soviet Union and China are independent and autonomous in decision-making, each with its own priorities. Our views are not entirely the same. But there are quite broad areas where such cooperation is possible and appropriate. First of all, this refers to the fact that our two countries can make a joint contribution to solving contemporary global problems and strengthening peace and security in Asia.

	The above three supports constitute the basis of the preparatory work for this meeting, and they strongly prove that the improvement of Sino-Soviet relations is not directed against any third country. In the end, it is beneficial to the entire international community.

	It is with this fundamental position that we come to Beijing. Of course, it is too early to talk about what problems will be encountered in the discussions. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that the Chinese side can be assured that we will adopt a benevolent and unbiased attitude towards the discussion of any issue.

	Comrades, our stay in China is relatively short, and most of the time will naturally be spent on political talks. But frankly, my wife and I are also very eager to learn about one of the oldest and most unique civilizations in the world and to feel the pulse of your country's real life.

	Today, we have had the opportunity to see some architectural complexes, view the cityscape of the capital along the way, and meet the residents of the capital. What impressed us most deeply was their sincere and friendly attitude towards the Soviet people.

	I think this best demonstrates that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is deeply rooted among the Chinese people. I think you can be assured that the feelings and sentiments of the Soviet people are the same.

	To the health of Comrade Yang Shangkun and other Chinese leaders present!

	To the friendly relations between our two countries and the great friendship between our peoples,

	Cheers!

### 戈尔巴乔夫在欢迎宴会上讲话  苏中关系正在进入一个崭新阶段

　　戈尔巴乔夫在欢迎宴会上讲话    
    苏中关系正在进入一个崭新阶段
    尊敬的杨尚昆主席！
    尊敬的同志们，朋友们！
    首先，请允许我对中华人民共和国领导人邀请我们访问贵国，并对我们在北京停留的最初几小时内所受到的盛情款待表示感谢。
    这几天，在中国首都正在发生着一件从各个角度来讲都是非同寻常的事件。这就是世界上两个最大的，有７５００公里长共同边界的国家已将其关系转到稳固的、健康的基础上来。这就是３０年来我们两个社会主义国家领导人进行的首次会晤。
    这次会晤来之不易，要求双方表现出智慧和责任感，坚持不懈地克服很多年以来沉重地笼罩在我们关系之上的消极的积垢和成见。
    今天，我们有理由说，苏中关系正在进入一个崭新的阶段。这是因为我们两国发生了变化，还因为我们周围的世界已经改变了面貌。
    在最近１０年里，中国向世界展示了新貌。贵国为社会生活各个方面实现现代化而掀起的热潮，苏联人民感到亲切和理解。
    工业化的日益增长，农业生产关系的改变，群众思想和主动精神的解放，中国社会精神文明的日益丰富——这一切都是实行勇敢大胆而意义深远的改革的结果，这些改革引起了全世界的很大兴趣。
    我们希望中国领导和中国人民顺利地解决在这条道路上所遇到的问题，并使其社会主义祖国取得稳定的进步。
    你们知道，在我们苏联也正在发生巨大的变化。
    “改革”这个概念非常准确地反映了我们整个社会所经历的演变过程。过去曾经延缓和阻碍我国发展并歪曲我们目的和理想的一切事物正在清除。与此同时，新的国家与社会机制正在形成，其目的是为了加速前进、从根本上改善苏联人民生活的素质。
    现在，苏联共产党所倡导的根本改革已经成为与我国工人阶级和全体劳动者休戚相关的事业。这就是改革不可逆转的保证，也是我们所从事的伟大事业、革新社会主义、充分发挥其人道主义与民主潜力这一事业将顺利完成的保障。
    总而言之，我们两国都已经行动起来了。而当前情况的一个特点是其他社会主义国家也进入了革新时期。社会主义正在进入一个新的发展阶段，也就是说，其创造性的潜力将得到充分发挥的阶段。
    我们也看到，这一改革过程正在波及越来越多的国家，并且还涉及国家关系的领域。
    我们当今世界的几代人面临着一个非常复杂而又崇高的任务，即：逐步建立一种新的国际秩序。
    在这条道路上，人类会遇到不少障碍。最近几年和几十年来，世界上发生的变化远非简单划一的。
    的确，在国际生活的许多方面都出现了令人感到充满希望的发展趋势。经常的政治对话，包括目前有社会各界人士广泛参加的在多边基础上进行的政治对话已经成为国际生活的不可分割的和十分重要的组成部分。换句话说，民间外交正在积极地促进和补充官方外交。
    在裁军方面已经采取了最初的步骤，对地区冲突实行政治解决已经有了一个开端，这些地区冲突数十年来一直是导致国际紧张局势的主要根源之一，并且曾经多次使世界濒临毁灭的边缘。
    国与国关系中的信任增强了，为解决尖锐的全球性问题而进行合作的愿望也更加强了。
    然而，世界仍然是很脆弱和易受损害的，这样说也是对的。军火库仍然存在着，而且在某些方面还在继续不断地扩充。军备更新至今还没有停止，而这意味着，不能排除新的杀伤力更强的武器有可能问世。生态浩劫的威胁也在增长，大自然已经不能再承受技术文明造成的污染并需要紧急的救援。
    摆脱饥饿和贫穷，克服许多国家经济不发达状况的问题仍然极为尖锐。
    中国古代哲学的主题思想之一，正如许多其他民族的哲学思想和民间传说中的主题思想一样，就是光明与黑暗，善与恶之间的斗争。可以说，这两个互相对立的概念当前正在进行一场特别不可调和的搏斗。
    人类正处在十字路口。实际上，恰恰是在这些年内要解决这样一个问题，即：人类能否走光明之路，能否制止它所面临的威胁，还是说人类文明将走向末日？  　我们相信良好的结局和美好的未来。这不仅仅是一种良好的愿望，而且是一种信念，这种信念基于对国际舞台上所发生的实际进程以及主张维护和平的政治和社会力量拥有的巨大能力作出的评价。
    显而易见，每个人首先是那些授权领导国家，进行决策的人们所肩负的责任是多么巨大！
    在这种形势下，每个国家，每个国家的人民都在考虑着自己在世界上的位置。四年前，我们开始了这种深入的分析，并与改革同时产生了现在众所周知的政治新思维。
    尊敬的中国同志们对政治新思维的基本思想是了解的。我们愿意将其运用到同中国的关系上去。
    请允许我在这里借用贵国的传统的政治词汇并用“三个赞成”来表达我对发展苏中关系的看法。
    第一个“赞成”，就是我们赞成国际交往中大家公认的原则，即：相互尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利与和平共处。
    其次，我们“赞成”在经济和文化方面进行合作以及在国家和社会各方面和各个级别上进行积极的政治对话。我们确信，这种合作有利于两国人民，有助于使他们更为顺利地达到他们自己所提出的重大目标。
    最后，我们“赞成”我们两国在解决当前迫切的国际问题时相互协作。当然，苏联和中国各自在决策方面是独立自主的，各有自己的侧重点。我们两国的观点不尽相同。但存在着相当广泛的领域，在那里相互之间进行这样的协作是可能的和适宜的。首先，这里指的是我们两国对解决当代全球性问题，对巩固亚洲和平与安全可以作出共同贡献。
    上述三个赞成构成这次会晤准备工作的基础，它们有力地证明苏中关系的改善并不针对任何第三国。归根到底，它对整个国际社会是有利的。
    我们正是抱着这样的基本立场前来北京的。理所当然，现在谈论在讨论中还会遇到什么问题，为时尚早。无论如何，我想强调，中国方面可以相信，我们对讨论任何问题都将采取善意和不抱成见的态度。
    同志们，我们在中国访问的时间比较短暂，大部分时间当然将用来进行政治会谈。但是坦率地说，我和我夫人也非常愿意对世界上最古老和独特的文明之一进行了解。体会一下贵国现实生活的脉搏。
    今天，我们已经有机会看到一些建筑群，一路上观看了首都的市容，见到了首都的居民。给我们留下最深刻印象的是他们对我们苏联人民坦诚和友好的态度。
    我想，这最能令人信服地说明，苏中关系正常化对中国人民来说是深得人心的。我想，你们可以相信，苏联人民的心情和感情也同样如此。
    祝杨尚昆同志和在座的其他中国领导人身体健康！
    为我们两国的睦邻关系和两国伟大人民的友谊，
    干杯！
