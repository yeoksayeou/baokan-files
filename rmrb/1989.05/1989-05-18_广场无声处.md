The air over Chang'an Street, adorned with flags to welcome Gorbachev, is filled with the wailing sirens of speeding ambulances and the deafening roar of the surging crowds.

As one gets closer to Tiananmen Square, the ambulance sirens grow more frequent. The square is teeming with people, but from the Monument to the People's Heroes to the History Museum and along East Chang'an Street, a passage formed by students linking arms has been maintained for several days. This passage is tense, orderly, and efficient. All personnel are barred from entering, including reporters, to ensure the passage—students' lifeline—remains unobstructed. Around 1:00 PM, a few students distributed dumplings to their classmates who were linking arms—two dumplings per person. There weren't many dumplings, only about twenty students received them, possibly donated by someone, but it's unknown. Two students were also seen cleaning up trash in the passage. By May 16, over 600 students had been transported to various hospitals through this arm-linked passage, and by May 17, this number had surged to over 1,700.

This morning, I managed to reach the emergency tent at the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. There were infusion devices and three students lying on camp beds, with a medical staff member feeding one of the students water. Looking around, I saw temporary emergency stations from Beijing Hospital, the China-Japan Friendship Hospital, the First Hospital of Peking University, and the Beijing Jiuzheng Hospital. Medical staff in white coats were bustling about, and here, white coats served as passes.

Guided by a female researcher in white from Peking Union Medical College, we entered the students' hunger strike circle under the Monument. Unlike the bustling outside, here it was almost silent.

As soon as we reached the outskirts, I saw a female student in a red shirt lying on a pile of bags and clothes under an umbrella, quietly crying. "What's wrong with her? Are you students on a hunger strike?" I asked a male student beside me. "She says she feels unwell. We are not on a hunger strike; we are here to support them," he replied. My companion in white checked her pulse and instructed nearby students to immediately take her to the emergency station.

In the Tsinghua circle, a male student lay on the ground covered with a military overcoat, his eyes closed, fanning himself with a small piece of cardboard, obviously hoping for some movement in the scorching air. Since May 13, when students began their hunger strike, the weather recorded in the People's Daily was: highest temperature 30°C, lowest temperature 10°C, maximum wind force 5 levels. Today, the temperature in the square was obviously above 30°C. I saw a student distributing ice cubes, and a few students placing ice cubes in their hands or on their faces to cool down, while others were eating ice cubes. Most of the students on hunger strike lay there with their eyes closed, as medical staff had advised them not to get excited due to their weakened state. I did not speak with them, so I do not know where they are from—Beijing, Henan, Sichuan? What are their family situations? Are they children of workers, farmers, teachers, or cadres? But one thing is certain: those who can enter top universities like Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Beijing Normal University are usually the best in their hometowns, the pride of their families. They have bright futures ahead, but they chose hunger under the scorching sun. Watching the faces of students gradually fading away in the square, my doctor companion was deeply distressed: "We are doctors, and seeing students like this is very painful. We hope the situation resolves quickly. We must take responsibility for the students' health!"

To better fulfill their responsibilities, doctors from Peking Union Medical College, along with those from the Peace Hospital, Fuwai Hospital, Chaoyang Hospital, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing Sixth Hospital, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital, Beijing Red Cross Chaoyang Hospital, and the Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, have joined forces. To make the rescue more orderly, they are printing on-site passes to limit the number of medical staff entering the hunger strike circle. They also plan to issue a call to action to coordinate doctors from various hospitals with different specialties to conduct more effective rescues. They also hope to establish a drug supply station. The editorial department of the Chinese Circulation Journal will print science popularization materials for the students. The broadcast station at the center of the hunger strike circle repeatedly reads the medical advice from Peking University First Hospital: "If you experience dizziness, palpitations, or pallor, seek medical attention immediately and do not refuse treatment..."

A professor surnamed Zhang from Beijing Medical University said: "Doctors need to organize and systematically observe, identify problems, and prevent more serious situations. Some students, if they had poor health conditions in the past, are now easily induced to develop new or old diseases. Medical staff must ensure that each student is checked twice a day, in the morning and evening, and not wait until the disease occurs to rescue..." He suggested dividing responsibilities by area, mentioning that this morning a student had severe kidney failure and another had pneumonia...

One of the organizers of the call to action, Dr. Xiao Feng from Peking Union Medical College, said that disinfectant should be sprinkled on the ground inside the hunger strike circle for surface disinfection to prevent the spread of infectious diseases. He even mentioned, "The future tasks will also be numerous. After the students' hunger strike, they will need physical examinations..." The students holding megaphones on the rescue passage were urgently shouting, "Make way, make way!" Another stretcher, accompanied by a few students and medical staff, was quickly loaded onto an ambulance, which sped away with its siren blaring. The ambulances were of various types. The Beijing Emergency Center ambulance had a prominent "Donated by the Italian Government" sign, and many hospital ambulances were parked in front of the History Museum and speeding along Chang'an Street. I wanted to find out how many ambulances and medical staff were present. Following the directions of the patrol team students, I came to the third level of the base of the Monument, where students were preparing to hold a meeting of the Municipal Federation of Students. In the afternoon, people from all walks of life in the city would come to the square to show support. Looking at these students, I heard the words of a student from the patrol team of Peking University: "The students of the Self-Governance Association are all exhausted and on the verge of collapse. Their pressure is too great..." I gave up the idea of continuing to talk to the student leaders. I could imagine the immense pressure they had placed on themselves due to their youth, sincerity, and sense of responsibility for their classmates. I could not disturb them further with our trivial problems.

In the more than thirty days and nights since the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang, how many students have been sleepless and exhausted due to excitement and agitation, needing our attention not only for the students on hunger strike but also for those holding megaphones, forming the rescue passage, and the students of the Self-Governance Association. They are constantly shouting, their arms bearing the pressure of tens of thousands of surging crowds, and more importantly, they are bearing the psychological responsibility and burden. They have all reached the point of extreme exhaustion.

Doctors are doing their best, but the ultimate solution depends on the government's attitude. Almost all the doctors I spoke with urged from their professional perspective: "It cannot be delayed any longer! The students absolutely cannot continue!" But a student said, "What if we don't persist? We have to persist!"

The vast Tiananmen Square is maintained in order by the students themselves, who also clean up the trash. They bear the weight of Tiananmen Square, shouldering everything that is too heavy for their age. Here, we have held the founding ceremony, and the solemn declaration of Chairman Mao Zedong, "The Chinese people have stood up," echoed here. There have been grand national day parades, Chairman Mao receiving millions of Red Guards, and the April Fifth Movement. The Tiananmen Square, which has experienced glory and disgrace, is a history of the republic. Some have brought it glory, while others have brought it shame. We have the responsibility to bring glory to Tiananmen. This is the responsibility of every citizen, and even more so, the responsibility of the government.

Is it now that Tiananmen Square and everything around it will all become responsibilities and burdens, all to be borne by the students?

　　广场无声处
    常立
    在为迎接戈尔巴乔夫而悬挂着彩旗的长安街上空，回响着急驶而过的救护车警笛声，伴着滚滚人潮发出的震耳声浪。
    越接近天安门广场，救护车的铃声便更一阵紧似一阵。天安门人潮似海，但从人民英雄纪念碑下至历史博物馆到东长安街，由大学生们的手臂连结起来的救护车通道已持续了几天。这个通道是紧张、有秩序和高效率的。一切人员在这里都被挡驾，记者也不例外，以保证这条通道——学生的生命线的畅通无阻。下午一点多，几位学生在给手臂挽着手臂的同学们分发面饺——每人两个。面饺不多，只有二十几个学生得到了，可能是谁捐献的罢，不得而知。还有两个学生在通道上清扫垃圾。至５月１６日为止，通过这手臂连结的通道，已有６００多名学生被送往各个医院，５月１７日，这个数字便激增到１７００多。
    今天上午，我好不容易来到协和医院的救护大篷下，这里有输液设备，有三位同学躺在行军床上，一位医护人员在给学生喂水。放眼看去，是北京医院、中日友好医院、北京医大第一医院、北京酒仙桥医院等临时救护站。穿白衣的医护人员在穿梭往来，在这里，白衣就是通行证。
    由协和一位穿白衣的女研究生导引，我们走进了纪念碑下的学生绝食圈。与广场外的沸腾不同，这里几乎没有声息。
    刚走到外围，阳伞下一堆书包和衣物上躺着一个穿红上衣的女同学，我看到她在悄悄流泪。“她怎么了，你们是绝食的学生吗？”我问身旁的一位男同学，“她说不舒服。我们不是绝食的学生，是来声援的。”我穿白衣的同伴替她号脉，并让旁边的几位同学马上把她送到救护站去。
    清华的圈子里，一位男同学闭着眼睛躺在铺着军大衣的地下，手里拿着一小块硬纸板扇风，显然是希望这灼热的空气流动一下。１３日学生绝食以来，《人民日报》记载的天气状况：最高温度３０度，最低温度１０度，最大风力５级。今天中午的广场温度显然超出了３０度，这时我看见一位同学在发冰块，几位同学把冰块放在手中或擦脸降温，几位同学在吃冰块。大多数绝食的同学都闭着眼睛躺在那里，因为被医护人员告知：同学身体虚弱，不能激动，我没有与他们交谈，不知他们家是那里？北京？河南？四川？家庭状况如何？工人、农民或者教师、干部的儿女？但有一点是无疑的，能进入北大、清华、北师大等北京高等学府的大都是他们家乡所在区、县的佼佼者，是天之骄子，如锦前程在等着他们，但他们却选择了烈日下的饥饿，眼看着一片片倒在广场中逐渐走向衰竭的学生那一张张太年青的脸，我的医生同伴痛心疾首：“我们是医生，看见学生这样非常难受，我们希望事情尽快解决，我们要对学生的健康负责啊！”
    为了更好地负起医生的责任，由协和医院发起，博爱医院、阜外医院、朝阳门医院、东直门医院、北京第六医院、北医一院、中医一院、北京红十字朝阳医院、北医中医学院焦灼的医生们已联合起来，为了使抢救更有秩序，他们正在印制现场通行证，限制进入绝食圈的医护人员人数，他们还拟发一个倡议书，为了协调各医院各有专长的医生更有效地进行抢救，为了向学生宣传卫生保健要点，宣传目前最危险的是什么。他们还希望建立药品供应站。中国循环杂志编辑室将为学生印发科普资料，绝食圈中心的广播站在一遍遍地宣读北医一院的医嘱：“如有头晕、心慌、脸色发白等症状马上就诊，不要拒绝治疗……”
    北京医科大学一位姓张的老教授说：“医生要组织起来系统观察，发现问题，防止更严重的情况，有些学生如果过去身体条件不好，现在很容易诱发新旧疾病，要组织医护人员保证早晚对每一个同学检查一次，不要等病已发生再抢救……”他建议分区负责，他说上午有一个同学肾衰竭很危险，还发现了得肺炎的……发表倡议书的组织者之一协和医院的肖锋医生说，应该对绝食圈内的地面撒消毒药水表面消毒，防止传染病流行，他甚至谈到“将来的任务也很不少，学生绝食之后还要身体检查……”
    救护通道上手持喇叭的学生又在紧张地大喊：“快让开，快让开！”又一个担架在几位同学和医护人员簇拥下被抬上了救护车，救护车急驶而去，响着铃声，救护车是各式各样的，北京急救中心救护车上有醒目的意大利政府赠送字样，还有许多医院的救护车停在历史博物馆门前和急驶在长安街上。我想了解一下在场的有多少辆救护车，有多少医护人员。循着纠察队学生的指点，来到纪念碑第三层基座上，学生们正在准备召开市高联会议，下午全市各界要来广场声援，望着这些同学们，耳旁响起北大纠察队学生的话：“学生自治会的同学身体都不行了，快崩溃了，他们的压力太大了……”我打消了继续找学生领袖谈话的想法，我可以想象得到由于年青和真诚和对同学的责任感，他们在自己身上加上的千钧压力，我不能再去为我们几个区区问题去打扰他们。
    在胡耀邦同志逝世后的３０多个日日夜夜里，多少大学生在亢奋、激动下寝食俱废、疲劳不堪，需要我们重视的不只是绝食的学生，还有这些手持话筒的纠察队、组成救护通道的同学和学生自治联合会的同学们，他们在不停地喊话，他们的手臂承受着成千上万不停涌来的群众的压力，更重要的是他们在承受着心理上的责任和重负，他们都已疲惫不堪到了极点。
    医生们在尽自己的责任和义务，但最终解决问题取决于政府的态度。几乎所有与我谈过话的医生都在以他们医生的角度呼吁：不能再拖延下去了！学生们绝对不能再坚持了！可一位同学说：“我们不坚持下去怎么办呢？只有坚持下去！”
    偌大的天安门广场，学生们自己维持秩序，自己清除垃圾，他们背负着天安们广场，担负着与他们年龄相比太显沉重的一切。这里，我们曾举行开国大典，毛泽东主席“中国人民从此站起来了”庄严宣告之后的欢呼声曾在这里回荡，曾有过壮阔的国庆游行，有过毛主席接见百万红卫兵，有过四五运动，饱经沧桑荣辱的天安门广场是共和国的一部历史，有人为她增辉，也有人使她蒙辱，我们有责任为天安门增添光荣。这是每一个公民的责任，更是政府的责任。
    难道现在的天安门广场和她周围发生的一切，都将变为责任、重负，都要由学生们去承担吗？
