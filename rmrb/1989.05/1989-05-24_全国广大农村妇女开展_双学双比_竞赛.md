A "learn culture, learn technology, compare achievements, compare contributions" "double learning, double comparison" competition is being vigorously carried out among rural women across the country. According to incomplete statistics from 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the number of women participating in this activity has reached about 70% of the total female labor force.

It is understood that among the 220 million illiterates nationwide, 210 million are in rural areas, and 70% of these illiterates are women. The low cultural and technical level of rural women is not in line with their position in agricultural production and has greatly affected agricultural development.

Since 1986, the All-China Women's Federation has continuously called on women at all levels to improve their quality and help women get rid of poverty and become prosperous. Local women's federations have organized rural women to learn culture and technology, using various forms, channels, and levels of training methods, combining long-term and short-term, centralized and decentralized training, to provide different levels of education and training to women with different cultural and technical backgrounds. They have imparted cultural and technical knowledge to rural women, helping them acquire production skills. In many places, 80% of the women who participated in the training have mastered one or two production technologies.

Based on the experiences summed up by various places, the All-China Women's Federation, in cooperation with 11 other units, issued a notice in March this year on "Deepening the 'Learn Culture, Learn Technology, Compare Achievements, Compare Contributions' Competition Among Rural Women of All Nationalities Across the Country." This five-year competition will change the past situation where rural women's work was solely handled by the women's federations. Recently, the All-China Women's Federation held a meeting attended by representatives from various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as representatives from the women's federations of 35 impoverished counties in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces. The meeting exchanged experiences in carrying out this activity.

　　全国广大农村妇女
    开展“双学双比”竞赛
    新华社济南５月２４日电  （记者郭修生）一场“学文化、学技术，比成绩、比贡献”的“双学双比”竞赛活动，正在我国广大农村妇女中扎扎实实展开。据１６个省、市、自治区的不完全统计，参加这项活动的妇女劳力已占妇女劳动力总数的７０％左右。
    据了解，目前，在全国２．２亿文盲中，有２．１亿在农村，而文盲中妇女又占到７０％。农村妇女的文化技术素质差状况与其在农业生产中所处的地位极不适应，在很大程度上影响了农业的发展。
    １９８６年以来，全国妇联不断向全国各级妇联发出提高妇女素质、帮助妇女脱贫致富的号召，各地妇联也从本地实际出发，组织农村妇女学文化、学技术，通过多形式、多渠道、多层次、长短结合、集中与分散结合的培训方法，对不同文化、不同技术程度的妇女施以不同层次的教育培训，向广大农村妇女传授文化技术知识，使他们掌握生产技能。在许多地方参加培训的妇女中，８０％的人掌握一至二门生产技术。
    全国妇联在总结各地经验的基础上，联合１１个单位，于今年３月发出了《关于在全国各族农村妇女中深入开展学文化、学技术、比成绩、比贡献竞赛活动的通知》。这项历时５年的竞赛活动，将改变过去农村妇女工作单靠妇联一家抓的局面。近日全国妇联召开了有各省、市、自治区和部分基层妇联负责人，以及河南、河北、山东３省３５个贫困县妇联负责人参加的会议，交流开展这项活动的经验。
