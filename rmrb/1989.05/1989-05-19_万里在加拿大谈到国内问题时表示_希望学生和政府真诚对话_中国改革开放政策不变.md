	Wan Li, while in Canada, discussed domestic issues and expressed hope for sincere dialogue between students and the government, affirming that China's reform and opening-up policy remains unchanged.

	NEW DELHI, May 18 (Xinhua) — Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today met with Guy Sabourin, Speaker of the Canadian Senate. He said that the patriotic enthusiasm shown by Chinese students is very precious. He hopes that students and the government can engage in sincere dialogue to resolve issues satisfactorily.

	Wan Li said that the recent demonstrations by students in Beijing and other places, demanding democracy and the rule of law and opposing corruption, are very valuable. He told Sabourin that the Chinese government will strengthen democracy and the rule of law, build a clean government, and expand opening up to the outside world.

	Sabourin believed that China's economy is vibrant and will develop healthily. He said that Canadian leaders will wholeheartedly support the development of friendly relations between the two countries.

	BEIJING, May 18 (Xinhua) — Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, today addressed Canadian business and industrial leaders, emphasizing that China attaches great importance to the development of economic and trade relations with Canada. Despite recent mass demonstrations and marches in China, he said, China's reform direction will not change, the policy of opening up to the outside world will not change, and the policy of conducting economic and technological exchanges and cooperation with foreign countries will not change.

	Wan Li made these remarks at a gathering of Canadian business and industrial leaders organized by the Canadian Conference Board. The Canadian Conference Board is an important economic research institution in Canada.

	Wan Li pointed out that in recent years, the economic relations between China and Canada have made considerable progress, but it should be noted that there is still great potential for cooperation between the two sides. He believes that the two countries should at least make efforts in the following three areas: first, both sides should take active measures to promote more Chinese products entering the Canadian market and reduce China's trade deficit; second, further improve the conditions for China's imports from Canada; third, further expand economic and technological cooperation between China and Canada.

　　万里在加拿大谈到国内问题时表示    
    希望学生和政府真诚对话    
    中国改革开放政策不变
    新华社渥太华５月１８日电（记者张元庭）全国人大常委会委员长万里今天在拜会加拿大参议院议长盖伊·夏博诺时说，目前中国学生所表现的爱国热情是非常可贵的。他希望学生和政府真诚对话，使问题能够得到令人满意的解决。
    万里说，北京等地学生近日示威要求民主和法制，反对腐败，这一行动是非常可贵的。他向夏博诺议长表示，中国政府将加强民主和法制，建立廉洁政府，扩大对外开放。
    夏博诺议长认为，目前中国的经济是有生命力的，并将健康地发展。他说，加拿大领导人将全心全意地支持两国友好关系的发展。
    本报渥太华５月１８日电　记者郭文福报道：万里委员长今天下午在这里向加拿大工商企业界人士发表讲话时强调，中国十分重视同加拿大经济贸易关系的发展，尽管目前中国发生了群众示威游行等事件，但中国改革的方向不会改变，对外开放的方针不会改变，同外国开展经济技术交流和合作的政策也不会改变。
    万里是在由加拿大会议局组织的加拿大工商企业界人士的聚会上发表上述讲话的。加拿大会议局是加拿大一所重要的经济问题研究机构。
    万里指出，中加两国的经济关系近年来取得了相当大的进展，但应当看到，双方的合作还蕴藏着巨大的潜力。我认为两国至少应当从以下三个方面作出努力：一是双方采取积极的措施，努力促进中国产品更多地进入加拿大市场，减少中方的贸易逆差；二是进一步改善中国从加拿大进口的条件；三是进一步扩大中加双方经济技术合作。
