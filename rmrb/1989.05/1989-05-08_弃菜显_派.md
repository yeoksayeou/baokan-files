Recently, using public funds for extravagant banquets has been widely criticized and is now seen as improper. Let's set that aside for now. But is it really proper to spend one's own money lavishly in restaurants?

The other day, I went to a restaurant and ordered some dishes. I noticed a young couple at the next table who had finished eating but had barely touched the several dishes and bowl of soup they had ordered. They walked out of the restaurant, arm in arm, with an air of superiority, as if to show off to everyone: "Look, we've left all our food untouched—how impressive!"

Such behavior is not uncommon. In their minds, it seems that eating out in a restaurant is different from eating at home. At home, one can finish all the food and drink all the soup without anyone seeing, and thus not lose face. In a restaurant, with so many people around, if one orders too little or finishes everything, others might laugh at you for being stingy. Thus, they perform this act of leaving food to display their "prestige." Little do they know that this desire to show off is actually a sign of poverty and carries a whiff of feudal decadence. It is said that after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, some impoverished officials and nobles, having lost their income, would smear a bit of oil on their lips before going to a teahouse, as if they had just finished a feast of delicacies. This act of pretension is likely the ancestor of today's display of "prestige." As we all know, even in economically developed countries, the wealthy do not engage in such hypocrisy. When it comes to eating, they are quite practical, ordering and paying for exactly what they will eat, and never using the amount of leftovers to show off their wealth. We should even more firmly establish the idea that "thrift is honorable, waste is shameful."

　　弃菜显“派”
    李郁秀
    眼下，用公款请客，大吃大喝，屡遭鞭挞，已名不正言不顺，姑且不去论它。这里，单说用自己的钱到馆子挥霍，就名正言顺了吗？
    日前，我到一家饭馆叫了点菜，看到邻桌一对男女青年，用饭已毕，要的几菜一汤，均无大动。两人依偎着高视阔步走出饭馆，从那得意劲儿看，像是向周围的人炫耀：瞧，我们把要的菜都剩下了，该有多“派”！
    这种事情，屡见不鲜。在这些人的观念里，似乎下馆子吃饭与在家里吃饭不同。在家里可以把菜吃光，把汤喝净，没人看见，不会丢“派”；馆子里人多，菜要少了，吃光了，恐人笑话小气，方演出弃菜显“派”的戏来。殊不知这种显“派”心理，恰是一种穷人的意识，沾上封建没落情绪之嫌了。据说民国之后，一些破落的达官显贵，断了收入，每日已无美味可食，去茶馆喝茶前还要往嘴唇上抹一点油，好像刚吃完山珍海味似的。这个摆阔恐是现在的显“派”的祖师爷。众所周知，就连经济发达国家的阔人都不这样虚伪了，在吃饭这个问题上人家颇为实际，吃多少买多少，绝不以扔下众多剩菜来显其富有。我们更应当树立“勤俭为荣，浪费可耻”的思想。　　　　　　　　李郁秀
