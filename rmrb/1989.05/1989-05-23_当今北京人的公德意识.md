In late spring, Beijing's weather is unpredictable, with frequent changes in wind and rain. However, over the past few days, the public morality of Beijing residents has been rising steadily, like a mercury column, reaching new heights, leaving people amazed! As one out-of-town visitor said, "Previously, my impression of Beijing people was that they had high political awareness. In the past few days, I have had a clear feeling: the public morality of Beijing people has returned!"

In May, the city's residents, both joyful and worried, have shown their enthusiasm in their words and deeds, as if everyone has realized that considering others is considering society. Visitors from other provinces and cities have often been frustrated by the service attitude of service industry workers in Beijing. On May 21st, at the Wangfujing Department Store, a customer bought a bicycle. He did not ask for adjustments, but the salesperson patiently and meticulously added an extra hour of service, tightening all the nuts on the bicycle, saying, "Ride with confidence, it's guaranteed to run smoothly throughout Beijing without repairs!" In a small restaurant near Beijing Railway Station, a customer was embarrassed when he found he had no grain tickets to pay for his meal. Just as he was at a loss, the waitress took out grain tickets from her own pocket and gave them to him.

The coldness between people seems to have disappeared among the residents. In mid-May, at the "Shenniu" three-wheeled rickshaw rental station at Beijing Railway Station, each rickshaw had a note saying, "Special service for professors and female students." Several owners told us that over the past few days, they have been voluntarily transporting elderly professors and female students without charging a penny. On the 17th, a graduate student who was a marshal during a parade hastily handed his clothes to an unfamiliar female colleague, only saying he was from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The next day, his coat was returned to his unit. On the 20th, a female student from Xi'an Jiaotong University bought something at a store and only realized at Tiananmen Square that she had lost her yellow backpack containing her camera. She was extremely anxious. At 9 PM, when she reached the Dongdan intersection after asking around, someone was holding her yellow backpack waiting for her. The female student was so moved that she burst into tears. After May 13th, some sections of the city center had interrupted public transportation. As long as pedestrians in the city waved at passing cars, they could easily get a ride, and no money was charged. Usually, it is difficult to find a taxi even if you have money. These two behaviors show what? A driver summed it up with the word "understanding."

Since thousands of students began their hunger strike at Tiananmen Square, the daily parade of people supporting the students and those coming to watch have been endless. Although there are student marshals on duty at many intersections, accidents between people and vehicles still occur. In the past, if either party involved in a collision spoke carelessly, it often led to verbal abuse and physical altercations. However, this phenomenon has almost disappeared now. On the afternoon of May 19th, at the intersection of Wangfujing Street and East Chang'an Street, a young man riding a bicycle was knocked down by a motorcycle. The person who caused the accident quickly helped the injured person up. One asked if he was hurt, and the other said, "It's okay, it's okay," followed by "I'm sorry, truly sorry."

From the night of May 19th to the afternoon of the 20th, in Hujiayuan, more than 20 military vehicles were stopped by residents at the street entrance. Some young workers among the onlookers walked up to the military vehicles, offering cigarettes and newspapers, sincerely and earnestly explaining to the soldiers the large-scale petition movement that had been taking place in the capital over the past few days. An elderly woman who had initially shouted, "If you want to leave, just drive over me," later brought hot water and steamed buns to the soldiers.

On May 21st, at a vegetable stall in the western suburbs, several farmers, knowing that vegetable supplies were tight these days, still insisted on not raising prices. In Xiaozhuang, some farmers voluntarily reduced the price of cucumbers and zucchini by one jiao. When asked why they didn't take the opportunity to raise prices, a farmer said, "At a time like this, one must have a conscience!"

May has been a month of trials and tribulations for Beijing people!

　　当今北京人的公德意识
    罗盘　秦淑文
    北京的初夏，气候多变，风雨无常。然而，连日来，北京人的公德意识却像持续上升的水银柱，越升越高，令人感叹不已！正如一位外地进京出差的人所说：“北京人以前给我的印象是政治觉悟高。这几天来，我又有了一个明显的感觉：北京人的公德回来了！”
    五月里，忧喜参半的市民们，将热情实实在在地抛洒在自己的一言一行中，似乎人人都认识到：为他人着想就是为社会着想。来过北京的外地人，过去大多为服务行业人员的服务态度气恼过。五月二十一日，在王府井百货大楼，一位顾客买了一辆自行车，他并没有提出调试，售货员主动耐心地给他额外附加了一小时服务，把自行车上的所有螺丝帽全拧紧一遍，说：“放心骑吧，包您跑遍北京不用维修！”在北京站一家小饭店里，一位顾客饭后付帐时却没有粮票，正当他尴尬窘迫时，服务员从自己的口袋里给他掏出了粮票。
    人与人之间的冷漠似乎在市民中消失了。五月中旬，在北京站“神牛”牌三轮车出租处，一辆辆三轮车上贴着“专送教授和女学生”的纸条。几位老板对我们说，两三天来，他们义务接送老教授和女学生，分文未收。十七日，一位游行时担任纠察队员的研究生匆忙中将衣服交给了一位不相识的女同志，只说自己是社会科学院的。一天之后，他的外衣被人送到单位。二十日，一位西安交大的女学生到商店买了东西，到天安门广场后才发现自己装有相机的黄背包丢失了，她万分焦虑。夜晚九时，当她沿路问寻到东单路口时，有个人正举着黄包等在那儿。这位女大学生感动得泪流满面。五月十三日以后的日子里，市中心的一些区段公共交通中断。只要在市区内步行的路人向过路的汽车招招手，很容易得允搭载，而且分文不收。平日里，掏钱乘“出租”尚时有难堪。这两种行为说明了什么？一位司机用“理解”二字道出了他们的心态。
    自天安门广场数千学生绝食以来，每日上街游行声援学生的队伍和前往观看的人流络绎不绝。尽管不少路口有学生纠察队员在值勤，仍然免不了发生人车碰撞，若在以往，只要相互碰撞的一方措辞不慎，常导致恶语相抛，拳脚相加。然而，现在，这种现象几乎绝迹了。五月十九日下午，在王府井大街和东长安街的交叉路口，一位年轻人骑自行车被一辆摩托车撞倒。撞人者赶忙扶起被撞人，一个问伤了没有，一个说“没事没事”，接着便是“对不起，真对不起。”
    十九日夜至二十日午，在呼家楼，二十多辆军车被市民拦截在大街口。围观的一些青年工人走到军车前，递上香烟，送上报纸，热忱而诚挚地给战士们讲述着连日来发生在首都的大规模请愿运动。一位先是呼喊着“要走就从我身上碾过去”的老太太，给战士们随后送来了开水和馒头。
    二十一日这天，西郊某蔬菜摊点，几位菜农明知这几天里蔬菜供应紧张，但仍坚持不涨价。在小庄，有的菜农主动将黄瓜、西葫芦等蔬菜降低一角钱销售。有人问他们为啥没乘机涨价，一位菜农说：“都这时候了，是人总要讲点良心！”
    五月，北京人经受磨难也经受洗礼！
