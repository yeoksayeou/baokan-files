	Democracy Needs to Be Built
	Ouyang Huairen

	To carry forward the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, we cannot avoid talking about democracy. Of course, the contributions of the May Fourth Movement to modern China's spiritual wealth are not limited to democracy, but at least democracy is a very prominent banner; promoting and developing it has significant practical meaning.

	Democracy, as a foreign term, was introduced to China and unanimously endorsed by the progressive intellectual community, which was a matter of great significance. However, people did not initially have a clear understanding of it. As we can see, some people advocated democracy based on the foreign concept of "natural rights," while others expounded on democracy using Mencius' idea of "the people are the most important, the ruler is the lightest." There were many schools of thought, each with its own interpretation. Even today, it is not easy to clearly explain this term. This is not only because different social systems have different forms and contents of democracy; it is also because different cultural backgrounds and psychological factors lead to different understandings of democracy. Even today, aren't there still many people who confuse "acting on behalf of the people" with democracy? But one point everyone agrees on is that democratic thought is good, and democratic politics is good. China's socialist movement has turned democratic thought into practice, although this practice has not been entirely satisfactory, it has been established as an institution and included in the constitution, such as "all power belongs to the people," and "the people, in accordance with the law, manage state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms." It can be said that socialist democracy has been scientifically expressed.

	The current problem seems not to be that we are unclear about the concept of socialist democracy or that there are still ambiguities, but rather that embodying and practicing this democratic politics, making it institutionalized and legalized, and truly implementing it in various aspects of social and political life, there is still a considerable gap.

	Humanity has made many efforts to seek social justice, democracy, and progress, and has accumulated a wealth of experience. Lightly dismissing the contributions made by pioneers for this or rejecting beneficial experiences and practices gained by others due to prejudice is not a historical materialist attitude. But on the other hand, blindly following these experiences and practices, copying them without considering one's own actual situation, is also not a wise attitude. Setting aside ideological factors, even if we do so, the actual situations of different countries are very different. For example, in China, out of 1.1 billion people, there are more than 200 million illiterates, and people's level of civilization and cultural quality is generally low. At least these two factors (and there are far more than these two factors) must be acknowledged and considered. Of course, talking about national conditions is not and should not be a reason to reject progress. If we use this as an excuse to maintain the status quo, what is the significance of studying national conditions? Starting from reality, we still need to start and move forward.

	There is another argument that says we should focus on economic construction now, and the matter of democratic politics can be postponed or done slowly. Focusing on economic construction is certainly correct, but separating economic construction from democratic political construction is neither theoretically sound nor practically feasible. We often say that a mistake in a decision can throw a huge amount of material wealth into the sea. Why? Isn't it because democratic procedures were not followed in decision-making? If one or a few people decide everything, how can such situations be avoided? From a broader perspective, whether it is reform or modernization, it is impossible without the efforts of hundreds of millions of people. But when people do not truly feel that they are masters, enjoying the right to be masters of the house, how can they be motivated to actively and willingly contribute their heart and sweat to economic construction? Moreover, fundamentally, the construction of socialist democracy is an intrinsic requirement for the development of socialist commodity economy. On one hand, there is the abuse of power and arbitrary interference; on the other hand, there is the requirement to act according to economic laws, fairly and equally. Is this possible? Civilization is a whole, and it is difficult to have economic prosperity in a backward or stagnant political environment.

	In building socialist democracy, we have both experience and lessons. One of the lessons is that we love to write empty articles. Articles can certainly be written, but if we indulge in them and neglect solid work, it is not good. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, we have done a lot of solid work in promoting the construction of socialist democratic politics, such as gradually improving the system of people's congresses, opening up various channels for political consultation and dialogue, developing the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, mobilizing the enthusiasm of various parties to participate in politics and policy-making, and using various forms to strengthen social supervision... The current problem is to strengthen and consolidate these already formed institutions and tap their potential to play a greater role. It is not that by doing these things we have achieved a high level of socialist democracy, but that to achieve a high level of socialist democracy, we must start from these most basic aspects. Do as much as we can, after all, it is better than just talking or talking more than doing. After all, democratic politics needs to be built step by step, brick by brick.

　　民主政治需要建设
    欧阳怀仁
    发扬五四精神，不能不谈民主。当然五四贡献于近代中国的精神财富不仅限于民主，但至少民主是个相当鲜明的旗帜；使之发扬光大，是很有现实意义的。
    民主作为一种外来词汇被介绍到中国，并得到进步知识界的一致赞同，是件意义非同寻常的事情。但并不是一开始人们就对其有明确认识和理解。正如我们所看到的那样：有人持外来的“天赋人权”说纵论民主，也有人则以孟子“民为重、君为轻”的民本思想阐扬民主……流派众多，各驰其说。即使是今天，要把这个词说清楚也不是件易事。这不仅是因为不同的社会形态有不同的民主，其内容和形式很不相同；而且还因为不同文化背景和文化心理对民主的理解也很不相同。即使今天不是还有很多人把“为民作主”和民主混为一谈么？但有一点大家是认同的，这就是，民主思想是好的，民主政治是好的。中国的社会主义运动使民主思想变成了实践，尽管这实践未尽人意，但它作为一种制度确立了并载入宪法，如“一切权力属于人民”，“人民依照法律规定，通过各种途径和形式，管理国家事务，管理经济和文化事业，管理社会事务。”应该说，社会主义民主已经有了较为科学的表述。
    现在的问题似乎并不是我们不明确社会主义民主的这个概念或者尚存歧义，而在于体现和实践这种民主政治，使之制度化、法律化，真正贯彻到社会政治生活的各个方面，还有相当大的差距。
    人类在谋求社会公正、民主和进步方面已经作了很多努力，也积累了十分丰富的经验。轻而易举地否定先驱者们为此所作出的贡献，或囿于偏见拒绝别人通过实践所获得的有益经验和作法，不是历史唯物主义的态度。但另一方面，对这些经验和作法马首是瞻，脱离自己的实际情况照搬照抄，也不是明智的态度。且不说意识形态的因素不能排除，即使排除这个因素，各国的实际情况也很不相同。例如，中国十一亿人口中有二亿多文盲，人们的文明修养和文化素质普遍较低。至少这两个因素（远不止这两个因素）是必须正视和考虑的吧。当然讲国情不是也不应该是拒绝进步的理由，如果因此而心安理得地维持现状，研究国情还有什么意义？从实际出发，还是要出发，要向前走。
    还有一种说法，认为现在我们要一心一意搞经济建设，民主政治这件事可以往后放、慢慢来。一心一意搞经济建设当然没错，但是把经济建设和民主政治建设割裂开，不仅理论上说不通，实践上也行不通。我们常说，一项决策的失误就可能把一笔巨大的物质财富投掷大海。为什么？还不就是决策时没有依民主程序办事么？一个人或几个人说了算，怎么可能避免这种情况发生呢？从更大的方面说，改革也好，现代化建设也好，没有亿万人民的努力奋斗是不行的。但在人们并没有真切地感到自己是主人翁，享有当家作主的权利的时候，怎么可能调动起积极性来，自觉自愿地为经济建设倾注心血和汗水呢？而且从根本上说，社会主义民主建设是社会主义商品经济发展的内在要求。一方面是滥用权力、横加干涉；另一方面又要求按经济规律办事，公正、平等，这可能么？文明是个整体，在落后或滞后的政治环境下，很难出现经济的蓬勃发展。
    建设社会主义民主，我们有经验也有教训。教训之一，就是太爱作空洞文章。文章当然是可以作的，但沉湎其中，忽视了做扎扎实实的工作就不好。党的十一届三中全会以来，我们在推进社会主义民主政治建设方面作了很多扎实的工作，比如逐步完善人民代表大会制度，开辟多种渠道进行政治协商对话，发展共产党领导下的多党合作制度，调动各方面参政议政的积极性，运用多种形式加强社会监督……现在的问题是，要加强巩固这些已经形成的制度，并把它的潜力挖掘出来，发挥更大的作用。并不是说做到了这些就算实现高度的社会主义民主了，而是说实现高度的社会主义民主，总要从这些最基础的方面做起。能做多少就做多少，毕竟比只说不做或者说的多做的少要好些。归根到底，民主政治需要我们脚踏实地地、一砖一瓦地建设。
