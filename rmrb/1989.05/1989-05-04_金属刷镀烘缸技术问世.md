Domestically produced paper will soon become smoother and cleaner. The successful development of metal brush plating technology to strengthen the surface of paper drying cylinders heralds this bright prospect for the paper industry.

The new technology, jointly developed by the Armored Forces Engineering Academy and the Henan Stanyan Red Star Machinery Factory, has recently passed the appraisal. The surface of the brush-plated cylinders has significantly improved in terms of wear resistance, corrosion resistance, and smoothness, which will greatly enhance the glossiness of the paper.
