	Smile
		Cao Fang

	To be honest, since coming to this mountain, today is the first time I have seen such a vivid and moving image: she held her head high, took small steps, and especially that smile on her fair face, it is unforgettable.

	What a smile it was! The lines at the corners of her mouth subtly retreated towards her cheeks, like ripples gently spreading across the tranquil surface of a deep lake, and within these ripples seemed to hide a hint of elusive and profound dreams. Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa could be compared to her, but Mona Lisa's rich and serene smile seemed to lack a certain passion; Tolstoy's Anna could be likened to her, but Anna's fleeting smile seemed to conceal a sense of sorrow. Yet today, among the multitude, amidst many complex expressions, she stood out so vividly.

	This smile seemed to have squeezed into my chaotic mind, making me see the mountain smiling, with wild grass like teeth, too direct; I saw the river smiling, with lines and gurgling sounds, not subtle enough; the colorful modern figures that rushed into my view seemed to be smiling, but it was too vulgar; the rubber mannequins by the counter smiled stiffly, smiling forcedly; behind the counter, the salesperson's cold face seemed to hide a smile, a cold smile that made one shiver; the students who flew from the classroom to the snack bar, smiling as they helped their parents buy pastries, but this smile was poor, making one uneasy; the beautiful corners of the mouths of singers and movie stars sometimes floated with a smile, but that smile was too artificial, too distant, too puzzling; the street vendors, their monotonous, business-like smiles repeatedly echoing a few words: "Buy or not?" All the eager eyes simultaneously bounced back the same notes: "Buy or not?" Buy what? Buy your smile?

	All my thoughts seemed to freeze. Suddenly, from afar, an old man in black clothes (here I can only use the pitiful word "drifted" to make up for the eyes' shortcomings) approached. His steady steps, stern eyes, and stubborn yet proud nostrils seemed to hide a smile, but it was too subtle and too cold; suddenly, from afar, a young man in white clothes (here I can only use the sad word "drifted" to fill the void in my thoughts) approached. His light and confident steps, excited and wise eyes, and righteous yet eloquent agile mouth seemed to hide a smile, but this smile was too immature, too easily worn away; the passersby who walked past me, their steady steps seemed to rub against a lazy smile, this smile did not seem to come from the heart, but rather from some distant corner, like a net covering those ordinary faces, giving one a slippery and impenetrable mysterious feeling. But the smile in this net was too mysterious, too rigid, too lifeless, too lacking in edges, too... too not a smile, sigh! I could no longer find such a unique smile. I returned home with inexplicable gloom, angrily picking up the mirror, trying to personally imitate that smile, but the one in the mirror was a withered, strange "smile" - like a smile reflected in a funhouse mirror.

　　微笑
    草芳
    说真的，自从到这山里来，我今天还是第一次见到这一瞬间鲜明动人的形象：她昂着头，迈着细碎的步子，特别是那白皙面庞上的微笑，令我难忘。
    那是怎样的一种笑呀！嘴角的纹线悄悄向面颊隐去，像微波从清幽深广的湖面上轻轻荡去，而在这波纹里面似乎隐藏着些许迷离幽邃的梦。达·芬奇的蒙娜丽莎可与她媲美，但蒙娜丽莎那富足、恬静的笑里面似乎缺少一种激情；托尔斯泰的安娜可与她相像，但安娜那瞬间而现的笑里面又似乎潜藏着一种忧戚。而今天，在芸芸众生中，在许多复杂的表情里，她，却是那样的鲜明。
    这笑，就像是挤进了我那乱糟糟的脑壳似的，使我看见山，山似在笑，竟笑出了牙齿样的野草，这太直露；我看见河似在笑，竟笑出了条条纹线、汩汩之声，这不够含蓄；那拥进我眼帘的五颜六色的摩登人像似乎在笑，但这太俗气；橡胶做成的模特儿在柜台旁直笑，但笑得死板、笑得勉强；柜台后的售货员冷冰冰的脸上似乎藏着笑，这种冷冷的飘在天国里的笑，冷得让人打哆嗦；从教室里飞进小吃部的小学生在帮他父母买饼时脸上浮着笑，但这笑得穷苦、笑得令人不安；歌星、电影明星那漂亮的嘴角有时飘着笑，但那笑太做作、太遥远、太令人费解；摆摊的个体户他们那单调的、为招徕顾客而挤出的生意的笑里热切地重复着几个字：“买不买？”所有热情的期待着的眼睛里同时回弹出同样的音符：“买不买？”买什么？买你那微笑么？
    我的所有的思想似乎在凝固，忽剌里从远方飘来一黑衣矮个老者（这里我只好用飘来这个可怜的词，来弥补眼睛的缺陷），他那稳健的步子里，严峻的眼睛里，倔而傲的鼻翼似乎藏着笑意，但这太含蓄太阴冷；忽剌里从远方飘来一白衣高个少者（这里我只好用飘来这个可悲的词，以填补思维的空缺），他那轻快而自信的步子，激动而睿智的眼睛，刚正而善辩的灵巧的嘴角似乎藏着笑意，但这笑太嫩稚太不成熟太容易被消磨掉；从我眼前走过的来来往往的行人，他们沉稳的步子里似乎摩娑着一种慵散的笑，这笑不像是从心底涌出，而似从某个遥远的角落飘来，网似的罩在那一张张平淡无奇的脸上，给人以滑而不透的神秘之感。但这网里的笑太神秘太僵硬太无生气太缺乏棱角太……太不成笑，唉！我再也找不出那样绝伦的笑了，我怀着莫名的郁闷回到家，愤愤地拿起镜子，想亲自摹临那种笑，可是，镜子里的那个，却是一种干瘪、怪异的“笑”相——像投在哈哈镜上的笑影。
