The Women's Federation and the East Tai Branch of the Bank of China jointly decided to start the "Women Love China" savings campaign on April 1st, requiring each female worker to save 30 yuan. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China decided to deduct 15% of workers' salaries each month starting from April 1st for a one-year fixed-term savings plan. Otherwise, the bank will not provide enterprises with salary advances or loans. Workers in the enterprises are lamenting, and some families are even struggling to make ends meet. Before this, during the implementation of the full-employee mortgage contract responsibility system in various enterprises in our city, workers in the enterprises had 100 to 200 yuan deducted from their salaries, middle-level cadres had 400 to 500 yuan deducted, and factory-level cadres had about 1,000 yuan deducted. In one factory, nearly half of the workers received less than 10 yuan in their February salaries.

Recently, the city has held layer-upon-layer meetings of Women's Federation directors to distribute "Women Love China" savings lottery tickets. Many enterprise women directors know the difficulties faced by the workers, but they cannot resist the pressure from above and have no choice but to return to the factory with the lottery tickets to promote them.

Mobilizing workers to participate in patriotic savings to support national construction, relevant departments should start from the actual income of workers' families, adhere to the principle of voluntariness, and absolutely cannot use coercion.

### 强迫参加储蓄  影响职工生活

　　强迫参加储蓄
    影响职工生活
    我市妇联、中国银行东台支行联合商定从４月１日起代办我市“女子爱中华”有奖储蓄活动，规定每个女职工储蓄３０元。市工商银行决定从４月１日起每月扣除职工工资１５％，定期储蓄１年。否则，银行不给企业提取工资现款和贷款。对此，企业职工叫苦不迭，有些人家甚至生活无着落。在这之前，我市各企业在实行全员抵押承包中，企业的工人每人扣一二百元，中层干部每人扣四五百元，厂级干部每人扣约１０００元。有家工厂近半数的工人２月份每人领到的工资不到１０元。
    最近，市里已层层召开妇联主任会议，摊派“女子爱中华”有奖储蓄奖券。不少企业的妇女主任知职工的困难，但无法抵挡上面的压力，只好带着奖券回厂推销。
    动员职工参加爱国储蓄，支援国家建设，有关部门应该从职工家庭实际收入出发，坚持自愿原则，绝不能强迫命令。
