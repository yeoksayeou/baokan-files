During my high school years, I read Lawrence's works, and one sentence from his writings has remained vivid in my memory: "Man is a half-circle." At that time, I couldn't understand the meaning of this sentence. As I grew older, I gradually realized that a half-circle is incomplete. How can a half-circle form a complete world? Therefore, a strong desire to find the other half of the circle suddenly and intensely arose within me.

My wife is a police detective. When people hear "police detective," they often imagine a stern and imposing figure. Initially, I compared my wife to a bomb tree. This peculiar tree grows in northern Africa, and its fruit is as large as a grapefruit, extremely hard. When it ripens, it suddenly explodes, with fragments flying out over 20 meters, its power comparable to a small hand grenade. Many birds, unaware of the danger, peck at this tree's fruit and are blown to pieces. I had a strange feeling, always thinking that I was like that "unaware" little bird.

On the first Mid-Autumn Festival night after our marriage, I sat alone at a round table, staring at the abundant dinner I had prepared. Outside the window, the moonlight was like silver. I looked around the empty new room, feeling half bitter and half annoyed.

When the wall clock struck twelve, my wife rushed in like a gust of wind.

I kept my head down and didn't acknowledge her.

A tall glass filled with red wine was extended in front of my eyes. I suddenly looked up and saw my wife gazing at me with her red, bloodshot eyes.

Neither of us spoke, we just lightly clinked glasses. This wine, as it went down my throat, was it sour? Sweet? Bitter? Spicy? I couldn't tell!

My wife glanced at her watch and said to me, "I only have half an hour. I have to go."

Half an hour? I understood. My wife had sacrificed her dinner time to come home and drink this reunion wine with me! I shouldn't have ignored her earlier!

My wife took the lunch box I handed her, looked at me, and without saying a word, turned and ran out the door.

Outside, the moon was full, but it couldn't keep my beloved by my side!

My heart was filled with mixed emotions. Then, my wife suddenly seemed to remember something and returned to my side. She placed the lunch box on the table, put her hands on my shoulders, and lightly kissed me. Still, she said nothing, picked up the lunch box on the table, and rushed out like a gust of wind.

I leaned against the doorway, watching my wife's figure, suddenly realizing that I had wronged her. My wife is not a bomb tree; she is an oil-bearing tree. This tree, with its white sap, grows naturally in Shaanxi Province. If you tear its leaves or twist its branches, the broken parts will ooze white oil. This oil can be used for both food and lighting.

Happiness has no formula.

If loneliness can be considered a state of mind, then loneliness must come from love. I dare say that those without love will never be lonely.

　　泌油树

    中学时代读了劳伦斯的作品，那里面的一句话至今还记忆犹新，“人是一个半圆”。当时我实在理解不了这句话的含义。随着年龄的递增，我慢慢地发现半个圆是残缺的，半个圆怎么能组成一个完整的世界呢？于是我内心深处，竟是那么突如其来，那么强烈地萌发了要找到那个圆的意念。
    我的妻是刑警。提起刑警，总使人想起那副横眉立目的形象。起初我把妻比成了炸弹树。这种奇异的树生长在非洲北部，果实有柚子般大，坚硬异常。它成熟时会突然爆炸，外壳碎片可飞出２０余米远，其威力不亚于小型手榴弹。不少鸟儿因“不知深浅”啄食这种树的果实而被炸死。我有一种莫名奇妙的心绪，总觉得我就像那只“不知深浅”的小鸟。
    婚后第一个中秋节的夜晚，我独身一人坐在圆桌前望着我亲手做的丰盛的晚餐发呆。窗外，月光如银。我环顾空洞洞的新房，心里一半是酸，一半是恼。
    当墙上的挂钟敲足１２下时，妻像一阵风似地走了进来。
    我低着头，没有理她。
    一杯装满红酒的高脚杯伸到我眼前。我猛抬头，发现妻正用她那双红肿的、布满血丝的眼睛望着我。
    我们谁也没有说话，只是轻轻地碰了一下杯。这杯酒喝进肚里，是酸？是甜？是苦？是辣？我说不出来！
    妻看了一眼手表对我说：“我只有半个钟头的时间，我得走了。”
    半个钟头？我明白了。妻是牺牲了吃饭时间回家与我喝的这杯团圆酒啊！我刚才不应该不理她！
    妻接过我给她的饭袋，望了我一眼，什么也没说，转身朝门外小跑去。
    屋外，月亮虽圆，却留不住我的心上人！
    我心里百感交加。这时妻又像突然间想起什么似地回到我身边，她将饭袋放在桌上，双手搭住我肩，轻轻地吻了一下我，还是什么话也没说，拿起桌上的饭袋，一阵风似地跑了。
    我倚在屋门旁，望着妻的背影，倏地感到从前枉了妻。妻不是炸弹树，她是一颗泌油树。这种乳白色的树土生土长在陕西省，撕破它的叶子或扭断其枝条，破损处就会流出白色的油液。这种油可供人们食用和点灯。
    幸福无公式。
    如果说孤独可算是一种人的心境的话，那么孤独一定源于爱。我敢说无爱的人永远也不会孤独。
