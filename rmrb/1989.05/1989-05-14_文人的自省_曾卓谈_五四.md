The Self-Reflection of Literary Figures
- Zeng Zhuo Discusses the May Fourth Movement
Li Hui

Zeng Zhuo: In 1955, the "Hu Feng Incident" occurred, dragging him into adversity. In the midst of hardship, he composed the famous poem "Tree on the Cliff's Edge": Its twisted body / Leaves the shape of the wind / It seems about to tumble into the abyss / Yet it also appears ready to take flight...

Coming from history, his unending poetic sentiment adds a layer of calm and heavy reflection. Poetry collection wins an award, essay collection wins an award, TV drama wins an award, and in old age, he blooms with full branches...

Reporter: I heard that the news of your consecutive awards caused a stir among the citizens of Wuhan: "Zeng Zhuo always wins awards; he must be a son of a high-ranking official." But they do not know that such a poet, who has experienced so much, writes with his life's blood, having nothing to do with any corruption in officialdom.

Zeng Zhuo: To clarify the facts, I sometimes speak at large gatherings: "I am Zeng Zhuo." People look and see this old man, just a scholar.

Reporter: Such comments reflect people's complex mindset and are also a distorted criticism of the current situation. If everyone, regardless of profession or official rank, including literary awards, competes on an equal footing, eliminating all external factors, such comments would naturally disappear.

Zeng Zhuo: Therefore, I often think that history has brought us to this point, and we particularly need to seriously learn from the lessons history has left us. Mistakes are inevitable, but we should try to avoid major decision-making errors, so that society can run healthily and stably on a track that conforms to the tide of the times. As a literary figure, I especially feel that our generation of literary figures should seriously reflect on ourselves.

Reporter: Six years ago, I remember you told me that your generation of literary figures has more content worthy of self-reflection, and I have never forgotten this sentence. Now, as we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, people seem to have delved deeper into the thinking of intellectuals themselves. What are your thoughts?

Zeng Zhuo: An important aspect of the May Fourth Movement was the historical proposal of "awakening of the individual," which is the key to breaking away from feudal traditions. At that time, intellectuals emphasized that individuals have the right to be independent and autonomous, advocated independent thinking, opposed dependence on ancient people, opposed blind obedience to feudal authorities, opposed being slaves to habitual forces, and demanded that individual personality and talent be freely developed. Reflecting on the experiences of our generation of literary figures over the past few decades, I still believe that self-reflection by literary figures is very important.

Reporter: Your generation of literary figures, mostly in their seventies, began creating in the early 1940s and entered a completely different era in the 1950s. For intellectuals, the continuous theme has probably been the thought reform movement.

Zeng Zhuo: I have never thought that literary figures—intellectuals—are perfect and flawless, and they themselves need to be updated. The problem is that thought reform is not an inheritance of the May Fourth tradition, raising literary figures to a higher level of awakening and liberation, allowing their individuality and creativity to be fully realized. On the contrary, endless thought reform movements are precisely the elimination of the independence of intellectuals, the elimination of their independent thinking in the ideological field, emphasizing blind obedience and dependence on authority. As a result, years of continuous thought reform movements have caused the distortion of contemporary literary figures' personalities and the deterioration of some people's conduct.

Reporter: I agree with this view. In the thought reform, very few literary figures could maintain a clear consciousness. From a large amount of historical materials, it can be seen that in every major and minor literary and political criticism, those at the forefront were not others, but literary figures who had become officials or wanted to become officials.

Zeng Zhuo: Every time I think of this, I feel a piercing pain. Lu Xun said that feudal society is "cannibalistic," and this feudal tradition, how could our literary figures be free from it? Over the decades, how many literary figures have not beaten others with sticks? Sometimes I ask myself if I have also "eaten" others? Therefore, when history develops to this day, literary figures, on the one hand, should critically reflect on the entire history, and on the other hand, should mercilessly dissect themselves, and in the process of dissection, conduct deeper reflections. I think Comrade Ba Jin has done a good job and set a good precedent. Our generation and the older generation of intellectuals should reflect on their own experiences and think about the unfinished tasks left by the May Fourth Movement, and through personal exploration, will more vividly feel the meaning of "awakening of the individual."

Reporter: What do you think is the main manifestation of the tragic nature of literary figures who have lost independent thinking?

Zeng Zhuo: I think the tragic nature of literary figures is at least of two kinds. One is that they know it is wrong but still acknowledge it as correct, voluntarily giving up the right to think and speak; the other is that they consider wrong as right, completely not thinking. In my opinion, the latter is a deeper tragedy. If we still do not recognize these tragedies today and do not actively strive to avoid them, then it is not only the tragedy of literary figures but also the tragedy of the entire nation.

Reporter: The problem is that not everyone can recognize historical errors and walk out of the historical shadow. Even more terrifying is what Lu Xun said about numbness, which may still occupy the souls of literary figures. For example, everyone says they want to oppose feudalism, but not everyone is fully aware of its urgency.

Zeng Zhuo: This is indeed a question worth considering for literary figures, especially when commemorating the May Fourth Movement, one can think more deeply and broadly. I think the horror of feudal traditions lies in their "infiltration" into our blood and flesh, often unconsciously. Now, commemorating the May Fourth Movement, we should recognize that the task of enlightenment for intellectuals is heavier, and this enlightenment includes two aspects: one is the enlightenment of literary figures themselves, always paying attention to self-reflection, becoming truly "awakened" people; the other is the enlightenment of the entire nation, recognizing that true living creativity exists in the freedom of individuals that make up the group. Without the individuality and subjectivity of individuals, there is no creativity of the entire nation.

### 文人的自省——曾卓谈“五四”

　　文人的自省    
    ——曾卓谈“五四”
    李辉
    曾卓：１９５５年“胡风集团”案的发生，将他卷入逆境。磨难之中他吟出著名的诗句《悬崖边的树》：它的弯曲的身体／留下了风的形状／它似乎即将倾跌进深谷里／却又像是要展翅飞翔……
    从历史中走来，不竭的诗情又平添冷静、沉重的思考。诗集获奖、散文集获奖、电视剧获奖，到了老年反而繁花满枝……
    记者：我听人讲，您连续获奖的消息曾在武汉的市民中引起一番议论：“曾卓老是获奖，他一定是个高干子弟。”其实，他们哪里知道你这种经历的诗人是用毕生的心血在写作，与什么官场的一切不正之风毫无关系。
    曾卓：为了澄清事实，我有时在大会上就讲：“我就是曾卓。”人们一看，这副老头相，一介书生而已。
    记者：这种议论反映出人们的复杂心态，也是对现状的一种扭曲了的批评。如果每个人，不管哪种职业，哪级官位，包括文艺评奖，都是平等地竞争，摈弃一切外在因素的作用，大概这样的议论也就会自然而然地消失。
    曾卓：所以，我常常想，历史走到今天，我们特别需要认真吸取历史留给我们的教训，失误难免，但要尽量避免各种大的决策失误，使社会能健康地、稳定地在符合时代潮流的轨道上运行。作为一个文人，尤其感到我们这代文人是应该认真地反思自己的。
    记者：六年前，记得你就对我说过，你们这代文人有更多的值得自省的内容，我一直没有忘记这句话。现在纪念“五四”７０周年，人们好像对知识分子本身的思考又深入了一步，不知你有什么想法？
    曾卓：“五四”运动的一个重要内容，是历史性地提出了“人的觉醒”，这是摆脱封建传统的关键。那时的知识分子，强调个人有独立自主的权利，提倡独立思考，反对依附古人，反对盲从封建权威，反对做习惯势力的奴隶，要求个人的个性和才能能够得到自由的发展。回想我们这一代文人近几十年的经历，我仍然认为文人的自省是非常重要的。
    记者：你们这代七十岁上下的文人，大多是４０年代初开始创作，５０年代一开始便进入一个与过去截然不同的时代。就知识分子而言，贯串始终的大概是思想改造运动。
    曾卓：我从不认为文人——也就是知识分子——是十全十美的，是无可挑剔的，它本身也需要更新。问题是思想改造不是对“五四”传统的继承，将文人提高到一个更高层次的觉醒和解放，使其个性和创造力得以充分的发挥。相反，无休止的思想改造运动恰恰是取消知识分子的独立性，取消他们在思想领域的独立思考，强调一种盲从，一种对权威的依附。结果，连续多年的思想改造运动，造成了当代文人性格的扭曲，也使一些人品行恶化。
    记者：我很同意你的这个看法。在思想改造中，很少有文人能保持清醒的意识。从大量的历史资料可以看到，历次大大小小的文艺批判、政治批判，走在前列的并不是别人，恰恰是当了官和想当官的文人本身。
    曾卓：每当想到这些，我总感到一阵揪心的痛苦。鲁迅说过封建社会是“吃人”的，这种封建传统恶习我们文人身上何尝没有。几十年中，文人中有几个人没有对旁人打过棍子？有时我就反问自己是不是也“吃”了旁人？所以，当历史发展到今天，文人一方面要批判性地对整个历史作深刻的反思，同时，也应该无情地解剖自己，在解剖之中做更深层次的思考。我觉得巴金同志做得很好，开了一个很好的风气。我们这一代以及老一辈的知识分子，都应该结合自己的经历来思考“五四”留下的尚未完成的任务，通过个人的探讨，才会更有血有肉地感受“人的觉醒”的意义。
    记者：失去独立思考的文人的悲剧性你认为主要表现在什么地方？
    曾卓：我认为文人的悲剧性至少有两种。一种是自己明明知道是错的，却违心地去承认正确，主动地放弃思考和言论的权利；一种是本身将错的认为是对的，完全不会去思考。依我看，后一种是更深刻的悲剧。我们今天如果还不能认识这些悲剧，不积极努力避免，那就不仅仅是文人的悲哀，更是全民族的悲哀了。
    记者：问题是并非所有人都能认识历史的谬误，走出历史的阴影，更可怕的是像鲁迅所讲的麻木，会不会依然占据文人的灵魂。譬如，人们都说要反封建，但未必都清醒意识到它的紧迫感。
    曾卓：这的确是一个值得文人们思考的问题，特别是在纪念“五四”的时候，更可以想得深一些，广泛一些。我认为封建传统的可怕，在于它“化”入了我们的血肉，自己往往不能自觉。现在纪念“五四”，应该认识到知识分子启蒙的任务更重，这种启蒙包括两个方面，一是文人自己的启蒙，时时注重自省，成为真正意义上的“觉醒”的人；一是整个民族的启蒙，认识到真正的活的创造力是存在于组成群体的个体的自由之中，没有个体的独立性、主体性，就没有整个民族的创造力。　（附图片）
