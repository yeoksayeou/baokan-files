The 18-year-old Indonesian player Wang Lianxiang tonight, amidst the roaring cheers of her home crowd, fought a grueling three-set match, winning 2-1 against South Korea's star player Lee Young-sook, securing the decisive third point for the Indonesian team.

With this, the standings for the A to G level group matches in the first-ever Sudirman Cup World Badminton Mixed Team Championship have been finalized.

China, Denmark, Indonesia, and South Korea secured the top two spots in the A level groups, earning their places in the semifinals. Japan, Chinese Taipei, Scotland, New Zealand, Norway, and Bulgaria won the championships in the B to G levels, respectively, and will each move up one level for the next tournament.

Tonight, the Indonesian and South Korean teams, to avoid facing China in the semifinals, fielded their strongest lineups and fought for the top spot in their group. South Korea's Jeong Min-hee/ Hwang Hye-young first won 2-1 against Indonesia's Verawati/ Xu Zhenli. Next, South Korea's men's doubles players Park Ju-bong/ Lee Sang-bok faced Indonesia's undefeated players Hong Chong-ming/ Guo Hongyuan, but performed poorly, losing 0-2. Later, Indonesian veteran Sujiyanto defeated his opponent Lee Kwang-jin 2-0, giving Indonesia a 2-1 lead.

The crucial fourth match was the women's singles. In the first two sets, Wang Lianxiang and Lee Young-sook were tied. In the third set, Lee Young-sook led 9-4, seemingly on her way to victory. At this critical moment, Wang Lianxiang capitalized on her opponent's eagerness to win, utilizing her strong defensive skills, patiently engaging her opponent, and seizing opportunities to attack. Amidst the cheers of the entire crowd, she reversed the score to 12-11, defeating Lee Young-sook. In the final match, Indonesia's mixed doubles pair quickly defeated the world's top mixed doubles players Park Ju-bong/ Jeong Min-hee, who had no heart to fight, with a 2-0 victory.

The Danish team today defeated the Swedish team 3-2, securing the second spot in the A level group.

Tomorrow night, the Chinese team will face the South Korean team, and the Indonesian team will face the Danish team, battling for a spot in the Sudirman Cup final.

    至此，首届苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛Ａ级至Ｇ级小组赛座次全部排定。

    今晚，印尼队和南朝鲜队为避免在半决赛中碰上中国队，排出最强阵容，力争小组第一。南朝鲜的郑明熙／黄惠英先以２∶１战胜印尼的维拉华蒂／许钻丽。接着，南朝鲜男双选手朴柱奉／李相福迎战自开赛以来保持不败的印尼选手洪忠中／郭宏源时，表现失常，以０∶２败北。尔后，印尼老将苏吉亚托以２∶０轻取对手李光珍，使印尼队以２∶１领先。
    关键的第四场是女单比赛。头两局，王莲香同李英淑战为平手。第三局，李英淑以９∶４领先，胜利在望。关键时刻，王莲香抓住对手求胜心切的心理。充分发挥自己防守好的特长，耐心与对手周旋，伺机进攻，在全场观众一面倒的呐喊助威中，反以１２∶１１战胜李英淑。在最后一场较量中，印尼混双选手很快便以２∶０战胜了无心恋战的世界混双名将朴柱奉／郑明熙。
    丹麦队今天以３∶２战胜瑞典队，取得Ａ级第一组的第二名。
