The phenomenon of illiteracy, which is contrary to human progress, has become a recognized social malady, causing increasing concern among people. Therefore, UNESCO recently announced that 1990 will be the International Literacy Year. China has 240 million illiterates, making it the country with the most illiterates in the world, and it is natural that we should participate in this global literacy campaign.

However, if we do not pay sufficient attention to this activity in advance, I am afraid that China's 1990 may not only fail to be a "literacy year" but may also become a "year of increased illiteracy." According to statistics, over the past four years, approximately 50 million students have dropped out of primary and secondary schools nationwide. A significant number of these dropouts have become illiterates or semi-illiterates, and this trend continues. Currently, there are still 2.7 million children who should be in school but are not. Additionally, some people who have previously become literate have rejoined the ranks of illiterates due to a lack of reinforcement of their literacy skills. According to a survey conducted by the state in Changde, Hunan, using the literacy standard, 70% of the people did not meet the literacy criteria. If this trend continues, the national figures will be staggering! If we cannot stop these three situations from continuing, how can we expect the number of illiterates to suddenly decrease by next year?

In recent years, we seem to have become somewhat complacent about the issue of illiteracy. Perhaps we have somewhat forgotten that illiteracy is the root cause of many social problems. It is accompanied by poverty and ignorance. Illiteracy inevitably leads to a large number of scientifically illiterate and legally illiterate people. A high number of scientifically illiterate people will hinder the improvement of productivity, while a high number of legally illiterate people will lead to an increase in criminal activities. Moreover, an increase in illiteracy is also an important factor affecting family planning. The data from China's third national census shows that the proportion of multiple births among illiterates is much higher than among other educational levels, and the uncontrolled growth of the population will bring a series of new social problems. A country filled with illiterates cannot talk about modernization. The arrival of the International Literacy Year should awaken the Chinese nation. The urgent task at hand is to strengthen the entire party and the nation's understanding of the importance of basic education, create the necessary conditions for eliminating illiteracy, and effectively implement the Compulsory Education Law. We must resolutely stop parents from forcing their children to drop out of school and enterprises from employing child labor, using legal means to prevent the increase of new illiterates among young people. For illiterates among adults, in the past few decades, we have had a good tradition and effective methods of mass literacy campaigns, which have been very successful. Now it is necessary to "revisit the old" and use various effective methods to carry out extensive and sustained literacy campaigns.

It can be believed that, as long as we seriously grasp and implement these measures, China can gradually reverse the trend of increasing illiteracy, and when the "International Literacy Year" arrives, there will be significant progress in eliminating illiteracy.

### 明年是“国际扫盲年”

　　明年是“国际扫盲年”
    陈秋中
    与人类进步相悖的文盲现象，已成为一种公认的社会病症，引起越来越多的人的忧虑。因此，联合国教科文组织最近宣布：１９９０年为国际扫盲年。我国文盲多达２．４亿，是世界上文盲最多的国家，理所当然要参加这一全球性的扫盲活动。
    但是，如果不提前对这项活动予以足够重视，我担心中国的１９９０年可能不仅不会是“扫盲年”，而且会是“增盲年”。据统计，全国中小学近４年流失学生５０００万左右。这些流失的学生中有相当数量成了文盲或半文盲，而这种流失还在继续。目前，全国还有２７０万应该背起书包的儿童没有上学。另外，过去一些已经脱盲的人，由于没有巩固识字成果，又重新加入了文盲行列。据国家按脱盲标准在湖南常德地区的普查，竟有７０％的人没有达到脱盲标准。以此类推，全国将是一个多么惊人的数字！如果不能制止上述三种情况继续发展，怎么能够设想一到明年文盲就突然减少呢？
    这些年，我们对文盲问题似乎有些麻木了。或许多少忘记了文盲是众多社会问题的根源，它与贫穷结伴，与愚昧为伍。有文盲，就必然有大量的科盲、法盲。而科盲众多，必然阻滞生产力水平的提高，法盲众多，则会导致违法犯罪现象增多。另外，文盲增多也是影响计划生育的重要原因之一。我国第三次人口普查资料表明，文盲的多胎率比例要远高于其他文化层次，而人口的无计划增长，又会带来一系列新的社会问题。一个文盲充斥的国家，是根本谈不上实现现代化的。国际扫盲年的到来，理当唤起中华民族的警觉。当务之急是加强全党全民对基础教育地位的认识，创造扫除文盲的必要条件。切实贯彻义务教育法，坚决制止家长强迫子女辍学、企业雇用童工的行为，用法律手段防止青少年中的新文盲增加。对于成年人中的文盲，在过去的几十年中，我们有实行群众性扫盲活动的好传统、好办法，并卓有成效。现在有必要“旧话重提”，用各种行之有效的办法，广泛、持久地开展扫盲活动。
    可以相信，只要认真去抓、去做，中国可以逐渐扭转文盲增多的局面，当“国际扫盲年”到来的时候，在扫除文盲方面会有明显的进展。
