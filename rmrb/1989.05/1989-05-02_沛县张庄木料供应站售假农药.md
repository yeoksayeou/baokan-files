The Zhangzhuang Timber Supply Station in Peixian Sells Fake Pesticides

On June 18th of last year, our department purchased four tons of fenthion from the Zhangzhuang Timber Supply Station of the Peixian Timber Company in Jiangsu. The price was 4,000 yuan per ton. After receiving the goods, our department discovered that this was a batch of fake pesticides. The next day, we sent the pesticides to the Tongshan Pesticide Factory and the Xuzhou City Commodity Company for testing. The test results showed: "No fenthion content." On the third day (June 20th), our department reported this situation to the Zhangzhuang Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the Tax Bureau, and the Bank, and wrote an appeal letter to the Peixian Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the Peixian People's Court, the Tongshan County Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the Tongshan Pesticide Factory, and other units. To this day, there has been no result. Our sales department has visited the Peixian Industrial and Commercial Bureau dozens of times, and their response is: "This matter has nothing to do with us." The Zhangzhuang Timber Supply Station refuses to refund the payment.

　　沛县张庄木料供应站售假农药
    去年六月十八日，我部购进江苏沛县木材公司张庄木材供应站四吨呋喃丹，每吨四千元。接货后，我部发现这是一批假农药，第二天便将农药送到铜山农药厂和徐州市土产公司化验。化验结果：“呋喃丹含量无”。第三天（六月二十日）我部向张庄工商所、税务局、银行反映了这一情况，并写申诉书给沛县工商局、沛县人民法院、铜山县工商局、铜山农药厂等单位，至今毫无结果。我经销部数十次找到沛县工商局，其答复是：“此事与我们无关。”张庄木材供应站拒不退还货款。
