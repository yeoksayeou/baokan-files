The Lebanese situation has deteriorated again. United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today called on all parties involved in the Lebanese conflict to strictly adhere to the ceasefire decision made by the Arab League on April 27.

	Syrian troops and their supported Muslim militias, along with the Lebanese Christian government army, accepted the Arab League's ceasefire request and stopped fighting on April 28. However, on May 1, fighting resumed in the Lebanese capital Beirut, and artillery exchanges continued today.

	De Cuéllar expressed deep concern over the recent deterioration of the situation in Lebanon in a statement today. He was also shocked by the indiscriminate and unrestrained shelling of civilians in Beirut by the warring parties.

　　黎巴嫩局势再度恶化  德奎利亚尔呼吁停火
    本报联合国５月９日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天呼吁卷入黎巴嫩战火的各方严格遵守阿拉伯联盟４月２７日的停火决定。
    叙利亚军队及其支持的穆斯林民兵同黎巴嫩基督教政府军接受阿盟停火要求在４月２８日停火后，于５月１日在黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特又重开战火，今天炮战仍在继续。
    德奎利亚尔今天在一项声明中对这几天来黎巴嫩局势的再度恶化深为关切，并对交战军队既无节制又无区分地炮轰贝鲁特平民感到惊讶。
