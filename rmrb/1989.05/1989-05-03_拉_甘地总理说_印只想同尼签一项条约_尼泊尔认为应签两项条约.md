Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said that India only wants to sign a unified treaty with Nepal, which can include both trade and transit aspects. Rajiv Gandhi made these remarks today in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, to reporters. He said that the treaty between India and Nepal cannot be amended.

The trade treaty and transit treaty between India and Nepal expired on March 23. Although both countries have expressed willingness to resolve existing issues through negotiations, there are currently no signs of resolution.

He said that the Indian government only wants to sign a unified treaty with Nepal, similar to the one previously signed. He suggested that Nepal negotiate with India on this issue.

The Nepalese government currently supports signing two treaties. It believes that trade is a bilateral issue and can be frequently negotiated and signed through talks; while transit is a permanent right enjoyed by a landlocked country in the international arena.

　　拉·甘地总理说    
    印只想同尼签一项条约    
    尼泊尔认为应签两项条约
    新华社新德里５月２日电  印度总理拉·甘地说，印度只想同尼泊尔签订一项统一的条约，其内容可包括贸易和过境两个方面。拉·甘地是今天在中央邦的比莱对记者说这番话的。他说，印度同尼泊尔签订的条约不能修订。
    印度和尼泊尔签订的贸易条约和过境条约于３月２３日到期以后，尽管两国表示愿意通过会谈解决现存的问题，但是目前尚无解决的迹象。
    他说，印度政府只想同尼泊尔签订一项统一的条约，就像以前曾经签订过的一项条约那样。他建议尼泊尔就这一问题同印度举行谈判。
    尼泊尔政府目前赞同签订两项条约。它认为，贸易是双边的问题，贸易条约可常常通过谈判来签订；而过境是一个内陆国家在国际上所享有的永久性权利。
