The British Foreign Office announced this afternoon that four Czechoslovakian diplomats will be expelled from the country.

A Foreign Office spokesman said that these four Czechoslovakian diplomats had been engaged in activities "inconsistent with their status" in the UK, in other words, "spy" activities. They must leave the UK within 14 days.

The spokesman said that this was a regrettable incident.

According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, the Czechoslovakian ambassador to the UK had previously been warned about a supposed "spy" incident last year, but the ambassador said that the Foreign Office's statement was "completely unfounded."

The British Foreign Office spokesman also said that this expulsion incident is unrelated to the expulsion of 11 Soviet personnel by the British government last week.

　　英驱逐四名捷外交官
    本报伦敦５月２５日电  记者陈特安报道：英国外交部今天下午宣布，４名捷克斯洛伐克外交官将被驱逐出境。
    外交部发言人说，这４名捷克斯洛伐克外交官在英国从事“与他们身份不相称的活动”，换个词说叫“间谍”活动，他们必须在１４天内离开英国。
    这位发言人说，这是一件令人遗憾的事。
    据英国广播公司报道，捷克斯洛伐克驻英大使去年曾因所谓“间谍”事件受到过警告，但这位大使说，英国外交部的说法是“完全没有事实根据的”。
    英国外交部发言人还说，这起驱逐事件同上周英国政府驱逐１１名苏联人员无关。
