Roaming the Snowy Plateau
— Visiting the Tibetan Painter Group of Sichuan Ganzi Prefecture

By Zhu Weiqun, People's Daily

Sichuan Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, with its vast grasslands and towering snow-capped mountains, has seen the rise of a group of modern Tibetan painters since the 1980s. Their debut at the first National Minority Art Exhibition with large-scale new "Tangkas" such as "King Gesar," "Jude Meets the Living Buddha Gedan," and "Auspicious and Prosperous" made a significant impact. Their works have since been exhibited in Beijing multiple times, shown overseas, and have entered the homes of Tibetan people in Sichuan, Tibet, Gansu, and Qinghai with a print run of 1.2 million copies.

This group of painters consists of more than 20 people. Unlike traditional Tibetan artisans, they are the first batch of Tibetan art workers trained by the state and have received systematic modern art education. However, as Ren Zhenlang, a first-level artist and current director of the prefecture's cultural bureau, told the reporter, "School education also brought a drawback: we became very unfamiliar with our own traditional art." He discussed their artistic growth process: "Although we had many creations in the past, they were too academic and did not have much social impact. Wang Chaoheng once commented on our paintings: if you cover the signature, it's hard to tell that the author is a Tibetan."

The reform wind of the 1980s blew to the foot of the racing horse mountain. The initial eight-member creation team crossed the Dangla Mountain and the Bird Mountain to the birthplace of traditional Tibetan paintings and one of the holy lands of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dege region, for an artistic investigation. Under the dim butter lamps in the Dege Temple, they saw a batch of giant "Tangkas" that had survived the "Cultural Revolution." The strange compositions, clever handling of time and space, vivid color contrasts, rich decorative flavors, and the strong national spirit conveyed through all of this left them astonished and deeply moved. Nima Zeren recalled, "We were all moved and convinced by our ancestors' unique art form. We suddenly realized that the unique artistic creation path we had been seeking for many years was actually on the land of Ganzi Prefecture."

Traditional Tibetan paintings mainly consist of scroll paintings called "Tangkas," as well as temple murals and woodblock illustrations for Buddhist scriptures. The Tangka uses the "Three Realms Composition": the middle part is the image of the Buddha, the upper part represents the "Sky Realm," and the lower part represents the "Earth Realm," with mountains, flowers, and clouds interspersed between the realms. To achieve a rich and luxurious color effect and contrast, gold and silver are often boldly used, and even pure gold lines are drawn. The pigments are mostly mineral-based and can remain unchanged for over a thousand years. From the Tangka, one can glimpse the unique aesthetic view of the Tibetan people, shaped by the peculiar environment of the plateau, which seeks balance through psychological compensation: the more unstable the nomadic life, the more it seeks tranquility and warmth; the more arduous and painful the journey of life, the more it seeks richness and splendor; the more vast and empty the living space, the more it seeks vividness and delicacy. While fully absorbing the nutrients of traditional Tibetan painting art, the painters broke away from the religious themes and infused their works with the new spirit of the times, reflecting the understanding and aspirations of the Tibetan people in the 1980s for a new life. In terms of technique, they also blended the strengths of Western painting, such as accurate shapes and reasonable perspective, and the elegant, detailed, and rigorous style of Chinese painting. Works reflecting Tibetan folklore such as "King Songtsen Gampo of Tibet" and "Prince Norbu," reflecting the new life in the Tibetan region such as "Jubilant Kangba" and "Kangding Love Song," and reflecting Tibetan customs such as "Auspicious Butter Sculptures" and "Bathing Picture" were all sold out upon publication, and bookstores repeatedly requested reprints.

During the exhibition in Algeria, more than 200,000 viewers attended, setting a new record for the number of visitors to a foreign art exhibition in the area. Tibetan compatriots living abroad brought back the best souvenirs when they returned home to visit their families, because these paintings carried their homesickness. The late Panchen Lama had received the painters, inscribed words and poems for their exhibitions and albums, and repeatedly instructed them to establish the Tibetan Painting Research Institute as soon as possible.

They deeply understood that the vitality of art lies in development. In recent years, they have delved into the study of Tibetan history, literature, and art, comprehensively improving their Tibetan studies. Last year, Gesang Yixi and eight others went deep into the Shannan region of Tibet, visiting almost all the famous temples and religious sites, accumulating a large number of copies and sketches. In Ganzi Prefecture, they specially rode horses to the rarely visited treasure trove of Tibetan paintings, the Bampo Temple, to seek advice from the 80-year-old old painter Tongla Zeng. The old painter happily invited each of them to draw a part on a painting he made, repeatedly saying, "Tangka has successors and will no longer be lost or forgotten!"

### 驰聘在雪山高原——访四川甘孜州藏族画家群

　　驰聘在雪山高原
    ——访四川甘孜州藏族画家群
    本报记者  朱维群
    四川甘孜藏族自治州，草原广袤，雪山高峻。８０年代以来，这里崛起一个藏族的现代画家群。自首届全国少数民族美展上他们以《格萨尔王》、《朱德会见格达活佛》、《吉祥如意》等大型新“唐卡”一炮打响以来，作品已几度轰动京城，出展海外，更以１２０万张的印量进入川、藏、甘、青广大藏族群众家庭。
    这个画家群有２０多人。与藏族传统画师、画匠不同的是，他们属于国家培养的第一批新型藏族艺术工作者，接受过系统的现代美术教育。“但是，院校教育也带来一个缺陷，就是对本民族的传统艺术反而很陌生”，一级美术师、现任州文化局长仁真郎加对记者谈起他们的艺术成长过程：“我们过去虽然也都有不少创作，可是失于学院派味道太浓，没有产生多大社会影响。王朝闻曾这样评论我们的画：把署名盖上，就很难看出作者是藏族同志。”
    八十年代改革之风吹到了跑马山下。创作组最初的８个人，翻过折多山、雀儿山，到康巴传统藏画的发祥地、藏传佛教文化的圣地之一——德格采风。在德格寺院昏暗的酥油灯下，他们头一次看到在“文革”劫难中幸存下来的一批巨幅“唐卡”。那奇异的构图造型、灵巧的时空处理，鲜明的色彩对比，浓郁的装饰韵味，以及这一切中透出的强烈民族精神，使他们目瞪口呆，心灵上感到巨大震动。尼玛泽仁回忆说：“我们全被祖先独特的艺术形式感动了、折服了。我们忽然发现，我们多少年寻觅的艺术创作的独特路子，其实就在甘孜州的土地上。”
    传统藏画以卷轴布画“唐卡”为主，也包括佛寺的壁画、佛经木刻插图等。唐卡画面使用“三界构成法”：中间为佛本尊像，上方表示“空界”，下方表示“地界”，各界间用山水、花卉、云彩相间。为了追求色彩富丽堂皇和对比效果，经常大胆使用金、银两色，甚至用纯金钩线。颜料多属矿物质，可逾千百年不变色。从唐卡画可以窥见藏族由高原奇特环境造成的通过心理互补而求得平衡的特殊审美观：游牧生活愈是动荡不安，愈是追求宁静温馨；人生旅途愈是艰辛痛苦，愈是追求富丽堂皇；生活空间愈是广漠空阔，愈是追求艳丽细腻。画家们在充分吸取传统藏画艺术养料时，冲出它以宗教题材为主的窠臼，在笔端注入新的时代精神、注入八十年代藏族人民对新生活的理解和憧憬。在画法上他们又揉进了西画造型准确、透视合理的特长和中国画工笔重彩的秀丽、细密、严谨的风格。反映藏族民间故事的《藏王松赞干布》、《诺桑王子》，反映藏区新生活的《欢腾的康巴》、《康定情歌》，反映藏区民俗的《吉祥酥油花》、《沐浴图》……出版后都一抢而空，书店一再要求增订。
    新藏画在阿尔及利亚展出期间观众逾２０万，开创当地外国美展参观人数的新纪录。流落国外的藏胞回乡探亲，带走的最好礼品就是藏画，因为这些画上寄托着他们的乡思。已故班禅大师曾接见画家们，为他们的画展、画册题词题诗，一再叮嘱要他们把藏画研究院尽快办起来。
    他们深深懂得，艺术的生命力在于发展。几年来，他们深入研究藏族历史、文学、美术，全面提高自己的藏学素质。去年，格桑益西等８人又深入西藏山南地区，访遍几乎全部著名寺院和宗教胜地，积累了大量临摹和速写。在甘孜州，他们专程骑马来到人迹罕至的藏画宝库八邦寺，向８０多岁的老画师通拉则翁求教。老画师高兴地请每人都在他制作的一幅画上画一个局部，连声说：“唐卡有了传人，再不会失散、失传了！”
