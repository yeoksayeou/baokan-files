Anhui's Huangshan City, which accounts for half of the province's tea production, has seen an early harvest of high-quality spring tea this year. However, due to a shortage of procurement funds, counties such as Qimen, Xuning, and Shexian have sent representatives to Hefei to seek assistance from the provincial government.

Recently, Vice Governor Wang Sheyun led key figures from relevant provincial departments to engage in direct dialogue with officials from Huangshan City and its counties, thereby alleviating the problem. Wang Shiji, the president of the Provincial Agricultural Bank, who had just returned from the tea-producing areas, announced that in addition to the 25 million yuan already allocated, another 25 million yuan would be allocated this year. If further difficulties arise, he can be contacted at any time, and he publicly provided his phone number on the spot. Vice Director Shao Tinggen of the Provincial Economic Commission guaranteed the immediate allocation of an additional 60,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity and some coal daily. The Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the Provincial Tea Company, and various tea-producing counties have also taken emergency measures.

　　安徽力保春茶收购金
    本报合肥电  记者张振国报道：茶叶产量占全省一半的安徽省黄山市，今年春茶采摘早，质量好于去年。但由于收购现金紧缺，祁门、休宁、歙县等县纷纷派人赶到合肥，向省府求援。
    日前，副省长汪涉云率领省直有关部门的实权人物与黄山市、县有关人士直接对话，使这一问题得到缓解。省农行行长王士举刚从茶叶产地回来，就表示在已拨款２５００万元的基础上，今年再追拨２５００万元，如果再有困难，可随时给他打电话，并当场把电话号码公之于众。省经委副主任邵挺根保证，从即日起每天增拨６万度电和部分煤炭。省供销社、省茶叶公司和各产茶县也都采取了紧急措施。
