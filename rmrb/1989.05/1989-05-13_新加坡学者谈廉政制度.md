The crisis in Japan's Takeshita Noboru cabinet once again illustrates that government corruption, such as the Recruit scandal, can only lead to self-destruction. How then can a government be considered "clean" and ensure this through institutional means? The author had a discussion with Professor Lim Siong Guan, Chairman of the Singapore National Wages Council and a senior lecturer in the Economics Department of the National University of Singapore, and Zhou Sunming, on this issue last week in Beijing.

Generally, economically successful countries pay close attention to maintaining government integrity through institutional means. Singapore's clean governance has been quite effective and stands out among ASEAN countries. Upon closer examination, the key lies in the fact that the country's top leaders can maintain integrity and strictly demand the same from their subordinates. Singapore has a special "Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau" (CPIB) responsible for investigating government officials' corruption cases and reporting directly to the Prime Minister's Office. Several years ago, a highly talented government minister was accused of accepting bribes amounting to several million dollars. Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister, personally handled the investigation and punishment. Under the immense pressure of public opinion, the minister committed suicide. This incident caused a great stir at the time.

Although Singapore's laws do not explicitly prohibit officials' children from engaging in business, it is absolutely not allowed to use one's parents' position to engage in illegal business or personal gain. Furthermore, the Singapore government implements a high-salary system for civil servants, who generally do not need to resort to illegal means such as corruption to maintain their livelihood. Additionally, a retirement pension system for civil servants is in place. Once a civil servant is dismissed or sentenced for corruption, their pension will be revoked, and more importantly, public opinion will ruin their reputation.

China and many developing countries have long been plagued by inflation problems, and China's uncontrolled consumption funds are particularly prominent. The government imposes an excess wage and bonus tax on enterprises, forcing employees to find ways to evade it, which is an open secret. Mr. Zhou Sunming introduced that when dealing with this problem, the Singapore government adopted the Employee Provident Fund system, which is essentially a mandatory social insurance and forced savings. The specific method is for the employer and employee to each contribute 25% of the wage income, managed by the Central Provident Fund Board, which pays interest at the bank deposit rate. This provident fund cannot be withdrawn during the period, but can only be returned upon the employee's retirement, with each person still needing to retain 30,000 Singapore dollars as insurance. The government uses this large provident fund to build a large number of low-cost housing units for sale to employees each year, who use their own provident funds to purchase the houses. Through this method, Singapore has achieved the goal of "everyone has a home," with 85% of residents owning their own homes.

### 新加坡学者谈廉政制度

　　新加坡学者谈廉政制度
    日本竹下登内阁出现的危机再次说明，类似里库路特受贿案那样的政府不廉洁，只能使政府自食其果。那么，政府如何又算得“廉洁”，并从体制上加以保证？笔者上周在北京与新加坡国立大学教授、新加坡全国薪金理事会主席林崇椰，国立大学经济系高级讲师周孙铭就此问题做了一番交谈。
    大凡经济上成功的国家都比较注意从体制上保持政府的廉洁，新加坡的廉洁政治颇有成效，在东盟国家中独树一帜。细细看来，其关键是国家最主要的领导人能保持清廉，并对下级严格要求。新加坡专门设有（ＣＰＩＢ）“行贿调查局”，是专门负责调查政府官员受贿的监督机构，直接向总理府提交报告。若干年前，曾有一位极有才能的政府部长，因被检举收贿几百万元，李光耀总理亲自过问查处。在社会各方舆论的强大压力下，该部长畏罪自杀。此事曾轰动一时。
    新加坡法律虽然没有规定官员子女不能经商，但决不允许借父母的地位非法经商或营私。再者，新加坡政府还实行公务员高薪制，公务员一般不必通过贪污受贿等非法手段来维持生活，同时，还实行公务员退休养老金制度。一旦公务员因贪污受贿等罪被开除或判刑，其养老金将被取消，更重要的是舆论会使这些人名誉扫地。
    中国以及许多发展中国家的通货膨胀问题一直使经济学家颇感头痛。中国的消费基金失控尤为突出。政府对企业实行超额工资奖金税，“逼迫”职工想方设法加以逃避已是公开的秘密。周孙铭先生介绍说，新加坡政府处理这个问题时，采用职工公积金制度，这实际是强制性的社会保险和强迫储蓄。具体做法是由企业雇主和职工从工资收入中各缴付２５％，由中央公积金管理委员会统一管理，按银行存款利率付息。这种公积金平时不能提取，要到职工退休后才能发还，但每人仍要留存３万新元作为保险。政府利用这笔庞大的公积金每年建造大量住房低价出售给职工，由职工用自己的公积金购房。通过这种方法，新加坡已有８５％的居民有了自己的住房，基本上实现了“住者有其房”的目标。
