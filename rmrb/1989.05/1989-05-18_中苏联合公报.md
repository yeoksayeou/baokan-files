Sino-Soviet Joint Communiqué

1. At the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun of the People's Republic of China, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited the People's Republic of China from May 15 to 18, 1989.

Chairman Deng Xiaoping met with Chairman Gorbachev in Beijing on May 16. The two leaders exchanged views on Sino-Soviet relations and international issues of common concern.

Chairman Yang Shangkun, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Zhao Ziyang, and Premier of the State Council Li Peng held meetings and talks with Chairman Gorbachev.

2. The leaders of the two countries found it beneficial to exchange views on Sino-Soviet relations. Both sides agreed that the high-level meeting between the two countries marked the normalization of state relations between China and the Soviet Union. This is in the interests and wishes of the peoples of the two countries and is conducive to maintaining world peace and stability. The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is not directed against any third country and does not harm the interests of any third country.

3. The two sides declared that the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics will develop their relations on the basis of the universally recognized principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence.

4. The two sides are willing to resolve all disputes between the two countries through peaceful negotiations and will not use force or the threat of force in any form, including the use of the territory, territorial waters, and airspace of third countries bordering either side.

The two countries believe that strictly adhering to the above points will help increase mutual trust and establish friendly neighborly relations between the two countries.

5. The leaders of the two countries reaffirmed the statement of the two foreign ministers on February 6, 1989, regarding the Cambodian issue, and, in light of further developments, had an in-depth exchange of views on the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue.

The two sides noted the decision for Vietnamese troops to withdraw completely from Cambodia by the end of September 1989 under effective international supervision.

The two sides are concerned and believe it is necessary that there be no civil war in Cambodia after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and that the future Cambodia should be an independent, peaceful, neutral, and non-aligned state. To this end, the two sides support the implementation of national reconciliation involving the four parties in Cambodia. The Chinese side advocates the establishment of a four-party transitional joint government led by Prince Sihanouk during the transitional period from the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops until the end of the elections. The Soviet side advocates that internal issues in Cambodia, including the organization of elections under international supervision, should be resolved by the Cambodians themselves. The Soviet side welcomes the acceleration of dialogue among the Khmer people and is willing to support any agreement reached by the various Cambodian factions on the resolution of the Cambodian issue.

The two sides will respect the results of the elections in Cambodia under international supervision.

The two sides believe that with the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, military aid to any party in Cambodia by the relevant countries should gradually decrease until it is completely stopped.

The two sides advocate the early convening of an international conference on the Cambodian issue.

The two sides reaffirm their continued efforts to promote an early, fair, and reasonable political settlement of the Cambodian issue and agree to continue discussions on the resolution of the Cambodian issue, including issues where there are still differences.

6. The two sides agreed to take measures to reduce military forces in the border regions of the two countries to the lowest level appropriate for normal neighborly relations and to make efforts to strengthen trust and maintain peace in the border regions.

The Chinese side welcomes the Soviet announcement to withdraw 75% of Soviet troops stationed in the Mongolian People's Republic and hopes that the remaining Soviet troops will be completely withdrawn from Mongolia within a relatively short period.

7. The two sides advocate resolving historical boundary issues between China and the Soviet Union fairly and reasonably on the basis of the relevant treaties on the current Sino-Soviet border, in accordance with internationally recognized legal norms, and in the spirit of equality, consultation, and mutual accommodation.

Based on the above principles, the leaders of the two countries agreed to accelerate discussions on the segments of the Sino-Soviet border that have not yet been agreed upon, in order to formulate a mutually acceptable solution to the eastern and western segments of the border. They entrusted the two foreign ministers to discuss the border issue in detail when necessary.

8. The two countries will actively and systematically develop relations in the fields of economy, trade, science and technology, and culture on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, and increase mutual understanding and exchanges between the peoples of the two countries.

9. The two sides believe that exchanging information and experiences on socialist construction and reform, and exchanging views on bilateral relations and international issues of common concern, is beneficial. Differences on certain issues between the two sides should not hinder the development of relations between the two countries.

10. The two sides agreed that the Communist Party of China and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union will conduct contacts and exchanges on the basis of independence, complete equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

11. The Chinese side reiterated that Taiwan is an inseparable part of the territory of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese side firmly opposes any attempt to create "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," or "Taiwan independence."

The Soviet side supports the position of the Chinese government on this issue.

12. The Chinese side reiterated that the People's Republic of China adheres to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and insists on the principle of not aligning with any country.

The Soviet side declared that Soviet foreign policy is based on the highest value of peace and consistently seeks to achieve actual disarmament, including nuclear disarmament; believes that the security of all countries cannot be ensured at the expense of others. It advocates prioritizing the values of all humanity and peaceful competition among different socio-economic systems under conditions of free choice and balanced interests.

13. The two sides declared that neither the People's Republic of China nor the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics seeks any form of hegemony in Asia and the Pacific region or in any other region of the world. The two countries believe that in international relations, any attempt by any country to impose its will on others or to seek any form of hegemony anywhere should be rejected.

14. The two sides believe that peace and development have become the two most important issues of the contemporary world. The two sides welcome the easing of the long-term tense international situation and positively evaluate the efforts of all countries to reduce armaments and ease military confrontation, as well as the progress made in resolving regional conflicts. The two sides are willing to continue their efforts in these areas.

The two sides advocate enhancing the prestige of the United Nations and supporting a greater role for the United Nations in international affairs, disarmament, solving global problems, and resolving regional conflicts. All countries, regardless of size or strength, have the right to equal participation in international life.

15. The two sides expressed concern over the worsening economic situation in the world, especially the deteriorating economic conditions of developing countries, the widening gap between the North and the South, and the increasingly serious debt problem. The two sides believe it is urgent to establish a new international economic order based on the interests and equal mutual benefit of all countries.

16. The two sides believe that solving global economic, social, population, and ecological problems is important for maintaining and developing world civilization and the quality of life for all humanity. The two sides declared that it is necessary to increase the attention of the international community, the United Nations, and other international organizations to these problems and to find coordinated ways to mitigate and resolve these problems.

17. The two countries believe it is necessary to promote the fundamental health of international relations. To this end, the Chinese side advocates establishing a new international political order based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the Soviet side advocates establishing a new political thinking in international relations. Each side's understanding of the current international relations is reflected in the above respective proposals and ideas.

18. The two sides believe that contact and dialogue between the leaders of the two countries are important and plan to continue in the future. Chairman Gorbachev, on behalf of the Soviet leadership, invited Comrades Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, Zhao Ziyang, and Li Peng to make official visits to the Soviet Union. The Chinese side expressed thanks for the invitation.

    十四、双方认为，和平与发展已成为当代世界两个最重大的问题。双方对长期紧张的国际形势出现缓和表示欢迎，并积极评价世界各国为裁减军备和缓和军事对抗作出的努力以及在解决各个地区冲突方面取得的进展，双方表示愿意在这些方面各自继续作出努力。
    中苏双方主张提高联合国的威望，支持联合国在国际事务、裁军、解决全球性问题以及地区冲突方面发挥更大的作用。世界所有国家，不论大小和强弱，都有权平等参与国际生活。
    十五、双方对世界经济形势，特别是发展中国家经济状况恶化、南北差距拉大、债务问题愈益严重表示关切。双方认为迫切的是，在考虑各国人民利益和平等互利的基础上建立国际经济新秩序。
