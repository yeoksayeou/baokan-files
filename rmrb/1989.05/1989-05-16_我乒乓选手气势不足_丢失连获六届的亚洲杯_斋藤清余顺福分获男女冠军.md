Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 16th.

Chinese table tennis players lost the Asian Cup, which they had won for six consecutive times. Japanese veteran Saito Kei and North Korean player Yo Sun Bok won the men's and women's singles titles respectively.

The Chinese men's team, still under the shadow of their failure in the World Table Tennis Championships, sent four players to compete. Ma Wen Ge and Chen Long Can secured the second and third places respectively, while Chen Zhi Bin and Yu Shen Tao finished ninth and tenth. In the men's singles final, Ma Wen Ge lost to Saito Kei with a score of 2:3 in a fierce and exciting rally.

The Chinese women's team seemed to be affected by the men's team's performance. Although world champion Qiao Hong played quite well, she lost her confidence in the middle of the fifth set, leading to her eventual defeat and securing the runner-up position. North Korean national champion Yo Sun Bok had strong attacking power, adapted well to Qiao Hong's serves, and had a fierce fighting spirit. She finally won the final with a score of 3:2. Another Chinese female player, Ding Yi Ping, finished fifth.

Hong Kong team's female players Chee Po Wah and Chan Dan Lei ranked third and fourth respectively.

　　我乒乓选手气势不足　丢失连获六届的亚洲杯    
    斋藤清余顺福分获男女冠军
    新华社北京５月１６日电（记者王俊璞）中国乒乓球队连获六届的亚洲杯今晚丢掉了。日本老将斋藤清和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的余顺福分别夺得了第七届亚洲杯乒乓球赛男、女单打冠军。
    仍被世乒赛失利阴影笼罩的中国男队，派４名选手出战，马文革和陈龙灿分获第二、第三名，陈志斌、于沈潼分获第九、第十名。男单决赛，马文革在激烈精彩的对攻战中以２∶３负于斋藤清。
    中国女队似乎也受了男队的影响，尽管世界冠军乔红打得相当不错，但由于第五局中间一段信心不足而导致最后失利，获得亚军。朝鲜全国冠军余顺福攻击力强，对乔红的发球比较适应，斗志也特别旺盛，终于以３∶２赢得了决赛的胜利，另一名中国女选手丁亚萍获得第五名。
    香港队女选手齐宝华和陈丹蕾分列第三、第四名。
