The globally significant room temperature nuclear fusion has attracted great attention from Chinese experts. At a recent meeting organized by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, scientists believed that room temperature nuclear fusion is a highly significant research topic that the scientific community is striving to break through, and it is worth exploring.

Attendees at this symposium included Wang Ganchang, Tang Haoching, Zhang Qinglian, Yu Min, and Hu Jimin.

During the meeting, some experts reported that several institutions in China have conducted preliminary explorations in the field of room temperature nuclear fusion. In addition to Beijing Normal University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Chemistry announcing successful "room temperature nuclear fusion" experiments, the Department of Technical Physics at Peking University observed abnormal gamma-ray phenomena using their reaction device; the Department of Chemistry at Peking University found abnormal concentrations of tritium in the gas-phase products of their heavy water electrolysis apparatus.

Scientists believe that the current key issue is experimental verification. This research is not a "short-term endeavor" but a long-term, arduous research project. It is crucial to avoid a rush to action. Relevant institutions should organize professional personnel to work closely together. At the appropriate time, select a few institutions with strong research capabilities, good equipment conditions, and innovative ideas to provide funding, thereby promoting the smooth progress of the research.

　　王淦昌唐敖庆等科学家指出    
    室温核聚变意义重大     
    当前重要问题是验证
    据新华社北京５月３日电  举世瞩目的室温核聚变引起了我国专家们的极大关注。在国家自然科学基金委员会最近召开的一次情况交流会上，科学家们认为，室温核聚变是一项意义重大，科学界致力于寻求突破的课题之一，很值得试探。
    出席这次座谈会的科学家有王淦昌、唐敖庆、张青莲、于敏、胡济民等。
    在会上，一些专家介绍，我国已有一些单位在室温核聚变领域进行了探索。除了北京师范大学、中国科学院化学研究所等单位宣布进行“室温核聚变”实验获得成功外，北京大学技术物理系利用他们的反应装置，曾观察到伽玛射线异常的现象；北京大学化学系使用的重水电解装置气相产物中氚浓度出现异常。
    科学家们认为，当前重要的问题是实验验证。这项研究决非“短期行为”，而是一项长期艰巨的研究课题，切忌一哄而上。有关单位应组织专业人员密切合作，同时在适当时机选择科研力量强、设备条件好、对某个问题有创新思想的少数单位择优资助，以促使研究的顺利开展。
