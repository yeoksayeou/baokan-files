Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, May 12th.

Nepalese government spokesman Bista said on May 11 that Nepal believes that all problems between Nepal and India can be resolved as long as the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are not violated.

He said that while Nepal will continue to safeguard the legitimate interests of friendly countries, it will also uphold its own sovereignty and independence.

He said that the current difficulties facing Nepal have attracted the attention and concern of many countries, which hope to see the problems resolved through friendly negotiations as soon as possible.

He said that the Nepalese government is prepared to hold unconditional negotiations with India, which should be conducted in an atmosphere of friendship, mutual trust, and understanding, rather than under economic coercion. He said, "Nepal demands that India lift the current trade restrictions on Nepal, show a friendly attitude, and create a good atmosphere for fruitful discussions."

He said that Nepal has clearly expressed its willingness to sit down with India to discuss all relevant issues, aiming to reach an agreement as soon as possible on taking necessary measures to restore normal relations between the two countries.
