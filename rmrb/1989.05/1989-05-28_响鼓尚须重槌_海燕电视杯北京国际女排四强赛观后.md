	Even a Resounding Drum Needs a Strong Beat
	—After the Beijing International Women's Volleyball Four-Strong Tournament

	To be honest, rather than watching the championship match between China and Cuba, it was more about seeing the new faces in the Chinese women's volleyball team. By comparing them with the old team members, we can make a basic assessment of the future of the Chinese women's volleyball team.

	The newly formed Chinese women's volleyball team has nine new members. In the two matches in Beijing, they did not all appear. However, one thing is certain: the addition of these nine young women has reduced the average age of the Chinese women's volleyball team to 20.7 years and increased the average height to 1.807 meters, which is the highest since 1976. The physical condition of the entire team has improved. Xu Xin, who won the Best Player award in this international women's volleyball four-strong tournament, is the most eye-catching among the new team members. This 1.74-meter-tall main attacker from Shanghai is the shortest in the team. However, Xu Xin's outstanding jumping ability and fierce spikes often cleverly broke through the dense block of the Cuban team, leaving a deep impression on the audience. Her high fighting spirit and quick, active defense, like her short hair, reflect her distinctive personality.

	Li Yunwu is the only player from Yunnan to enter the national team in recent years. As a right-side hitter, although her height is not as good as Yang Xiaojun, she shows a lot of spirit and outstanding explosive power in both the quick attack in position three and the quick ball cover. Her hand shape and timing during blocking are also well-controlled, making her very active on the court. Perhaps influenced by her parents who are involved in the arts, she appears too gentle in both temperament and on-court style, lacking ferocity.

	He Yunshu, who plays the main attacker position with Xu Xin, comes from a sports family in Fujian. Her good physical condition and all-around personal skills make her an ideal candidate for the main attacker in the eyes of coach Hu Jin. In the two matches in Beijing, He Yunshu did not perform to her full potential. At 19 years old, with a youthful face full of innocence, her technical level, like her age, still needs time to mature. This may be one of the main reasons why she needs to build more confidence.

	Lai Yawen and Zhou Hong from Liaoning are members of the domestic champion team, one plays as a right-side hitter and the other as a second setter. In this unfamiliar collective, they need to re-familiarize themselves with each teammate, find new tacit understanding, and coordination consciousness. Their physical conditions undoubtedly lay the foundation for their future development, especially the 1.87-meter-tall Lai Yawen.

	The Chinese women's volleyball team, which has been formed for five months, made its domestic debut with both failures and victories. People saw the girls' efforts and their courage and hope to revive their former glory. They also saw the difficulty and long-term nature of achieving this goal from their not yet fully formed tactical coordination and the large fluctuations in their on-court performance.

	It seems too early to make a comprehensive evaluation of this team now. Even a resounding drum needs a strong beat. A mature, high-level team must go through several international competitions before it can be truly affirmed or denied. For this, every coach and athlete must pay the price.

　　响鼓尚须重槌
    ——海燕电视杯北京国际女排四强赛观后
    本报记者  吴骅  陈昭
    说老实话，与其说是看中国、古巴两队的冠军争夺战，倒不如说是去看看中国女排中的那些新面孔，通过与老队员的比较，对中国女排的今后做一个基本的估价。
    新组建的中国女排中有九名是新人，在北京的两场比赛中，她们没有全部亮相。但有一点可以肯定，这九位姑娘的加入使中国女排的平均年龄降至２０．７岁，平均身高增至１９７６年以来中国女排从未有过的１．８０７米。全队的身体条件有改观。获得本届国际女排四强赛最佳运动员称号的许新，是新队员中最引人注目的一个。这位来自上海的主攻手身高仅有１．７４米，是全队中最矮的。但是，许新出众的弹跳力和凌厉的扣杀，多次巧妙地突破了古巴队的密集拦网，给观众留下深刻的印象。高昂的战斗热情和快速积极的防守就像她的短发一样体现出她鲜明的性格。
    李云武是近几年来唯一进入国家队的云南姑娘。作为副攻手，尽管她的身高不如杨晓君，但无论是三号位快攻，还是快球掩护，她都表现出一股灵气和突出的爆发力。拦网时她的手形和起跳时机也掌握得适度，场上十分活跃。也许是受搞文艺的父母影响，从气质和场上作风上她显得过于文静，缺乏狠劲。
    与许新同打主攻位置的何云舒来自福建的一个体育世家，良好的身体素质和全面的个人技术使她成为教练胡进眼中主攻手的理想候选人。在北京的两场比赛，何云舒发挥得不尽人意，１９岁的年龄和充满稚气的面孔，同她的技术水平一样，尚需逐渐地发育成熟。这也许是她最需要增加自信心的原因之一。
    来自辽宁的赖亚文、周红都是国内冠军队的成员，一个是打副攻的，一个是打接应二传的。在这个陌生的集体里，她们需要重新熟悉每个队友，寻找新的默契和配合意识。她俩的身体条件无疑为将来的发展奠定了基础，特别是１．８７米的赖亚文。
    组建５个月的中国女排首次在国内亮相，有失败，有胜利。人们从姑娘们的努力中看到了她们想重振昔日雄风的勇气和希望，也从她们尚未成型的技战术配合和临场发挥的大幅度波动中看到了实现这一目标的艰巨性和长期性。
    现在对这支队伍全面评价似乎太早。响鼓尚须重槌。一支成熟的高水平的队伍必须经历几次国际大赛之后，才能真正被肯定或者否定。为此，每一个教练员和运动员都必须付出代价。
