Today evening, Li Xicong, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, and Chen Xitong, a State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, on behalf of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, visited workers of Shougang who maintain production and stability.

Accompanied by Shougang leaders Zhou Guanwu and others, Li Xicong and Chen Xitong visited the No. 2 Blast Furnace of the Shougang Iron and Steel Plant, where they met and shook hands with workers who had been maintaining production. Li Xicong raised his thumb and said, "The working class is truly remarkable. The entire city of Beijing learns from you and salutes you."

Shougang representatives reported on the production situation for the year so far: From January to April, profits increased by 24% compared to the same period last year, and there was a further increase in May. Zhou Guanwu said, "Shougang workers oppose the turmoil because we deeply understand the importance of stability and unity. Without a stable social environment, Shougang's reforms would not have achieved ten consecutive years of 20% profit growth."

Li Xicong and Chen Xitong expressed their admiration for the high sense of responsibility shown by Shougang workers in this serious political struggle concerning the fate of the nation and the people. They praised the workers for their clear stance, steadfast position, and overcoming various difficulties to maintain production, making significant contributions to maintaining the stability and normal production order of the capital. This demonstrates that the working class is indeed the main force in developing production and maintaining stability and unity.

Li Xicong and Chen Xitong pointed out that currently, a small number of people have not given up their attempts to create turmoil. The task of restoring normal order in the capital and maintaining social stability is still arduous. They hope that Shougang workers will continue to play a leading role, making new contributions to stopping the turmoil, maintaining stability and unity, quickly restoring normal order, and promoting reform and construction.

　　李锡铭陈希同等代表北京市委市府
    慰问坚持生产维护稳定的首钢职工
    新华社北京５月２７日电  （记者刘浦泉）今天晚上，中共中央政治局委员、北京市委书记李锡铭，国务委员、北京市市长陈希同等代表市委和市政府慰问了坚持生产、维护稳定的首钢职工。
    在首钢负责人周冠五等陪同下，李锡铭、陈希同等来到首钢炼铁厂二高炉，看望了在这里坚持生产的炉前工，同他们一一握手。李锡铭竖起大拇指说：“工人阶级真了不起，我们全市人民向你们学习，向你们致敬。”
    首钢的同志汇报了今年以来的生产情况：１至４月，实现利润比去年同期增加２４％，５月份又有新的提高。周冠五说：“首钢职工反对动乱，因为我们深深懂得安定团结的重要性。没有安定的社会环境，首钢的改革就难以取得连续十年利润递增２０％的成就。”
    李锡铭、陈希同对首钢工人在当前这场关系到国家和民族前途命运的严肃政治斗争中表现的高度主人翁责任感表示钦佩，赞扬他们旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，克服种种困难，坚持生产，为维护首都的安定团结和正常生产秩序作出了重要贡献，说明工人阶级不愧是发展生产和维护安定团结的主力军。
    李锡铭、陈希同指出，当前极少数人并没有放弃继续制造动乱的企图，恢复首都正常秩序、维护社会安定的任务还很艰巨。他们希望首钢工人继续发挥主力军作用，为制止动乱、维护安定团结、尽快恢复正常秩序、推进改革和建设作出新贡献。
