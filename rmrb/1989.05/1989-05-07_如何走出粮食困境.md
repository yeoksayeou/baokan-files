	How to Overcome the Grain Crisis

	Why has the grain crisis arisen and how can we overcome it? These are the hot topics of concern to all sectors of society. Recently, the National Grain Economy Society held a meeting to reflect on and discuss these issues.

	The Grain Situation is Serious, Serious in What Way?

	The grain situation is serious and cannot be taken lightly. This is the strong appeal of the members of the Grain Economy Society. Due to the weakening of China's agricultural and grain foundations, reduced investment, shrinking arable land, and a growing population, grain production has stagnated while consumption has rapidly increased. In recent years, the national population has increased by over 15 million annually, arable land has decreased by over 6 million mu (approximately 400,000 hectares) each year, and grain consumption has increased by 100-150 billion kilograms. In 1988 compared to 1984, the total grain output decreased by 13.31 billion kilograms, while the population increased by 61.39 million, reducing the per capita grain availability from 393.5 kilograms to 362 kilograms. Particularly noteworthy is the dramatic increase in feed grain and grain used for brewing. From 1980 to 1987, the national grain consumption for feed increased by over 50 billion kilograms, and grain used for brewing increased by over 8 billion kilograms. China's grain problem is not one of surplus but of shortage. To solve the problem of grain shortage in China, it is generally necessary to focus on domestic grain production, except for areas specializing in forestry, animal husbandry, fisheries, and economic crops, crop cultivation must prioritize grain. The view that "prioritizing animal husbandry" and "prioritizing meat consumption" to reduce grain production is one-sided and divorced from China's national conditions.

	China must adhere to the "five persistences" in the near and medium term: persist in the fundamental role of agriculture and grain, persist in the policy of self-reliance, persist in the dual-track system and planned supply of grain for urban residents, persist in the regional balance of grain production and sales, and persist in moderate consumption and grain conservation.

	The Optimistic View is Incorrect, and the Pessimistic View is Unfounded.

	Everyone pointed out that the pessimistic views on the grain issue only see the constraints and unfavorable aspects of China's resources, while ignoring the potential and favorable factors of agricultural resources nationwide. China's arable land resources have not been fully developed and utilized, with 2/3 of the arable land still being medium to low-yield fields, with significant potential for increased production. According to surveys, China's near and medium-term developable "five wastelands" (wasteland, barren hills, barren mountains, barren waters, and barren beaches) amount to approximately 3 billion mu. This is roughly equivalent to 3.7 times, 8.2 times, 8.3 times, 6.8 times, and 4.9 times the land area of France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and Sweden, respectively, the main countries in Western Europe. Awakening dormant resources and further developing agriculture will be highly promising. Accelerating agricultural and grain technological progress can significantly improve resource utilization rates, reduce resource loss rates, and achieve higher output with less input. It is also important to recognize that developing the several hundred million farmers as a vast human resource will be a great driving force for agricultural development, with the potential to increase grain, cotton, meat, eggs, milk, and other agricultural products by 200-300 billion kilograms annually.

	Activate Circulation, Improve the Dual-Track System for Grain

	Should grain circulation revert to the unified purchase and supply system, or should we persist in gradual reform? Everyone clearly rejects the former and supports the latter. It was pointed out that for a considerable period, grain purchase and sales cannot be completely liberalized. From the long-term trend of national grain shortages and the basic situation of relatively low urban and rural incomes, and considering the balance of urban and rural interests, China can only persist in and improve the dual-track system for grain in the near and medium term:

	(1) The state's contracted grain procurement quantity should be stabilized at 50 billion kilograms, generally not increased, but also not reduced too quickly.

	(2) The name of contracted procurement can be changed to state procurement, making it more appropriate.

	(3) Procurement prices should be appropriately increased to enhance the income of grain farmers.

	(4) Establish an organized, development-oriented grain market, in addition to the primary market, establish a standardized grain wholesale market.

	(5) Grain outside the contracted procurement can be freely traded by farmers in the market.

	(6) Formulate grain trading regulations, establish standards and norms for grain management departments and operating enterprises, formulate conditions and trading rules for opening grain wholesale markets, and establish standards and norms for farmers selling grain.

### 如何走出粮食困境

　　如何走出粮食困境
    为何造成粮食困境和如何走出粮食困境？这是当前社会各界关注的热点问题。不久前举行的全国粮食经济学会理事会上，对此进行了反思和研讨。
    　　　　粮食形势严峻，严峻在哪里？
    粮食形势严峻，不可掉以轻心。这是粮经学会理事们的强烈呼吁。由于我国农业和粮食基础削弱，投入减少；耕地缩减，人口膨胀；粮食生产徘徊，消费迅增。近几年全国人口每年增长１５００万以上，耕地每年减少６００多万亩，粮食消费增长１００——１５０亿公斤。１９８８年与１９８４年相比，粮食总产量降低１３３．１亿公斤，而人口猛增６１３９万，人均粮食占有量由３９３．５公斤降到３６２公斤。尤其值得注意的是，饲料粮和酿酒用粮剧增。从１９８０年到１９８７年，全国饲料耗粮增长５００多亿公斤，酿酒耗粮增加８０多亿公斤。中国粮食不是患多，而是患短缺。解决中国粮食不足问题，就总体而言应以立足国内发展粮食生产为主，除林、牧、渔业和经济作物集中产区外，种植业还必须以粮为主。那种认为“以牧为主”和“以肉食为主”而减少粮食生产的看法是片面的，脱离我国国情的。
    我国在近、中期必须做到“五个坚持”：坚持农业和粮食的“两基础”的地位，坚持立足国内为主的方针，坚持粮食“双轨制”和城市居民口粮计划供应，坚持粮食生产和销售区域性平衡的格局，坚持适度消费，节约用粮。
    　　　　“乐观论”不对，“悲观论”也没有根据。
    大家明确指出，粮食问题上的悲观论调，只看到我国资源的约束性和不利方面，而忽视了全国农业资源的潜力和有利因素。我国国土中的耕地资源还没有充分开发利用，有２／３的耕地还是中低产田，增产潜力可观。据调查研究，我国近、中期可开发的“五荒”（荒地、荒坡、荒山、荒水、荒滩）资源约有３０亿亩。这大体分别相当于西欧法国、联邦德国、英国、意大利和瑞典等主要国家国土面积的３．７倍、８．２倍、８．３倍、６．８倍和４．９倍。唤醒沉睡资源，进一步开发农业，将大有可为。加快农业和粮食科技进步，可以大大提高资源利用率，减少资源损耗率，以较少的投入取得较高的产出。更要看到，把几亿农民当作一个巨大的人力资源加以开发是推动农业发展的伟大力量，每年有把握增产二三百亿公斤粮食、棉花、肉类、蛋奶等农副产品。
    　　　　搞活流通，完善粮食“双轨制”
    粮食流通是退回统购统销，还是坚持稳步改革？大家明确否定前者，赞成后者。指出，粮食购销在相当长时期内不可能完全放开。从全国粮食短缺的长期趋势和城乡居民的收入较低的基本情况出发，从兼顾城乡利益出发，我国在近、中期内只能坚持和完善粮食“双轨制”：（１）国家定购粮食数量稳定在５００亿公斤，数量一般不增加，但也不要调减过快。（２）合同定购的名称可以改为国家定购，以名符其实。（３）定购价格应当适当调高，以增加种粮农民的收益。（４）建立有组织、开发型的粮食市场，除初级市场外，建立规范化的粮食批发市场。（５）定购外的粮食，农民可在市场上自由交易。（６）制定粮食交易法规，制定粮食管理部门和经营企业的行为准则和规范，制定开办粮食批发市场的条件、交易规则，制定农民售粮的行为准则和规范。
