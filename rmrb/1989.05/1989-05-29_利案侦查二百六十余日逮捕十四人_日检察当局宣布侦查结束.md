The investigation into the Recruit stock scandal, which was revealed last June, began in September and has lasted 264 days. The Tokyo District Prosecutors' Office has questioned 3,800 people, investigated over 80 locations, and gathered approximately 9,000 pieces of evidence. A total of 14 people have been arrested, and 17 have been indicted. The investigation was announced to have concluded today.

This afternoon, Tokyo District Prosecutor Yoshinobu Yoshinaga met with reporters and announced the end of the investigation. He also stated that simplified indictments and fines of 200,000 yen each would be issued against four individuals: Fumio Hattori, the secretary of former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa; Jizo Shimizu, the secretary of Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Shinzo Abe; Kikuo Katayama, the secretary of former Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Rokuro Kato; and Masayoshi Sakamaki, the accounting manager. The reason for these actions is that these four individuals received large political donations from Recruit and its affiliated companies, which exceeded the limits set by the Political Funds Control Law and were not reported.

When asked about the 11 politicians who were not held criminally responsible, Prosecutor Yoshinaga stated that the stock transactions of the 11 individuals who were not indicted were handled by their secretaries, and the politicians themselves did not believe they had income from stock trading. After thorough investigation and research from various angles, it was concluded that, aside from those already indicted, no one could be considered a subject of bribery. The prosecutors have done everything they should have done.

Following the announcement of the conclusion of the Recruit scandal investigation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Noboru Takeshita, representing the Japanese government, stated that the government believes the prosecutors' investigation was conducted fairly and impartially. Leaders of the opposition parties expressed regret and demanded that the political and moral responsibilities of the 11 politicians be further pursued. Political commentators also expressed their opinions, stating that the prosecutors' investigation was disappointing and lacked thoroughness.

　　利案侦查二百六十余日逮捕十四人
    日检察当局宣布侦查结束
    本报东京五月二十九日电  记者于青报道：自去年六月利库路特股票丑闻披露于世后，东京地方检察当局从九月开始立案侦查，历时二百六十四天，调查了三千八百多人，侦查了八十余处，掌握证据约九千个。先后共逮捕十四人，起诉十七人，侦查工作今天宣布结束。
    今天下午，东京地方检察厅检察官吉永祐介在会见记者时发表谈话宣布，侦查工作到此结束。同时宣布，对前藏相宫泽喜一的秘书服部恒雄、自民党干事长安倍晋太郎的秘书清水二三夫、前农林水产相加藤六月的秘书片山纪久郎和会计负责人坂卷正芳进行简略方式起诉，并罚款二十万日元。理由是，上述四人以不同形式接受了利库路特公司及其关联企业的大量政治捐款，其数额超过政治资金规则法而未申报。
    当记者问到还有十一名政治家未被追究刑事责任时，吉永检察官说，没有立案的十一人的股票买卖是在秘书一级处理的，议员本人不认为有股票交易收入。从各种角度侦查和充分研究证据的结果，除已经起诉的人外，没有人可以成为行贿受贿罪的对象。检察当局尽力做了应该做的事情。
    利案侦查工作宣布结束后，官房长官小渊代表日本政府发表讲话说，政府认为检察当局的侦查是严正、公平的。各在野党领导人表示遗憾，要求继续追究十一名政治家政治和道义的责任。政治评论家也纷纷发表谈话，认为检察当局虎头蛇尾的侦查工作有失众望。
