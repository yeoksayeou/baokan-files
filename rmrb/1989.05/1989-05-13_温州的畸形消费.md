Over the past few years, many phenomena have appeared like ghosts on this land, only to disappear with the wind. However, the phenomenon of abnormal consumption seems to be on the rise, becoming a fashionable topic among young people.

At the Wenzhou Hotel, I encountered a young couple who had traveled from a village over a hundred miles away to see a certain movie star perform. The tickets had already been sold out. The black market price for each ticket was as high as 160 yuan, and they failed to buy any on the first day and the second day as well. I asked them, "It's a pity you didn't get to see the movie star, isn't it?" The girl smiled and said, "Whether we see it or not doesn't matter. I just regret not being able to sit in the theater."

They had already transcended the specific goal of being a movie star fan. Whether it was an east wind or a west wind blowing from the stage, whether they liked it or not, they would still come, because their greatest interest was in participating in entertainment consumption.

The street "Karaoke" dance halls, open to anyone, charge 15 yuan per ticket. But if you think people come here to dance and show off, you are wrong. When people gather here, they wear gold and silver, you wear a sweater worth over $100, and I must buy one worth a thousand yuan to accompany you. You wear five gold rings, and I have a gold bracelet worth three taels, sparkling with jewels, shining brightly. If you talk about interest, showing off wealth is their true interest. If you encounter someone who doesn't understand, even if they go in, they will be like a heretic watching someone meditate, not understanding the meaning at all.

Some people in Wenzhou, regardless of whether they have a lot of money or not, must do two big things: build a house and construct a tomb. I once visited a farmer's newly built house in Lèqīng County. The total construction cost was 600,000 yuan, a four-story square building with luxurious interior and exterior decorations, all aluminum alloy doors and windows, and tea-colored glass. Building such a house in Beijing would cost at least 1.5 million yuan. According to local people, this is not even the highest level. Sitting in the car, looking at the green mountains and waters, the view is full of eye-catching chair-shaped tombs. The driver introduced that there are now cases of spending 500,000 yuan to build a tomb. In many aspects, the competition for consumption is becoming increasingly fierce, with "learning, catching up, helping, and surpassing" and endless innovations. It doesn't matter how much money is spent, but seeking to make a splash has become the mindset of many people. Some young people who don't have money also don't want to fall behind in consumption, resulting in the phenomenon of "low income, high consumption." People can be exhausted, but spending money cannot be slack.

Consumption is the greatest spiritual entertainment, even for funerals. Once, I stayed overnight at the Cāngnán County Party Committee Guesthouse, and in the early morning, I was awakened by a huge wave of noise. Outside the window, there was a human chain several miles long moving, which turned out to be a funeral procession. Instead of playing mournful music, they blew and played "In the Field of Hope" and "Toast Song" loudly. The crowd marched forward in a joyful atmosphere. The original sad event was turned into a grand celebration with blowing and playing.

For many young people in Wenzhou, consumption is the goal. Material consumption is far from being the first necessity for survival. They want to eat live eels. Once the eels die, the price drops significantly, but those with money will not eat them. In 1988, the rush to buy goods in the inland areas at most impacted the use-value of consumer goods in stores, but the eyes of Wenzhou people had already gone beyond that. Some girls use perfume, which must be French, and German or American perfumes are absolutely not allowed. They don't care about the muddy and smelly streets under their feet, nor do they care about which fragrance type is suitable for the yellow skin of Chinese people. Money spent is money spent, and it brings happiness, making life full of sunshine. A wealthy individual entrepreneur frankly told me that he values money first and spending money second.

The abnormal consumption in Wenzhou has caused concern among many people. Some young people imitate adults by "spending a thousand yuan in one go," but they don't have that much money, so they turn to crime. For most workers, farmers, and intellectuals, overconsumption is a luxury. Their income is far from being able to afford spending several "big notes" to see a movie star. Overconsumption also has a significant negative impact on the social environment. Many people view the easy abandonment of the traditional Chinese virtues of "thrift" and "simplicity" as a great regret. For the vast number of growing young people, they need not only material conditions but also rich spiritual wealth. The Wenzhou people who are eager to consume, have they thought about this?

### 温州的畸形消费

　　温州的畸形消费
    孙芙蓉
    近几年，许多现象曾像幽灵一样光顾这块土地，接着便随风飘去。而畸形消费现象却似乎方兴未艾，成为青年人的时髦话题。
    在温州饭店，我遇到一对年轻人，他们刚从百里之外的乡下专程赶来看某影星的演出。票早已售完。黑市票价每张高达１６０元，他们第一天没买上，第二天也落空了。我问他们：“没看上影星，可惜吗？”女孩笑眯眯地说：“看上看不上都无所谓，只是我没能坐在剧场里，感到很遗憾。”
    他们已经超越了影迷追星的具体目的。不管是东南风还是西北风从台上刮过，不管是自己喜欢还是不喜欢，他们都会来的，因为他们最大兴趣是参加娱乐消费。
    向任何人都开放的街头“卡拉ＯＫ”舞厅，门票每张１５元。但你若认为人们来这儿是为比舞弄姿，那就错了。当人们聚拢于此，穿金戴银，你穿１００美元以上的毛衫，我必得千元人民币买来与你相陪，你戴５颗金镏子，我有３两黄金的手镯，珠光宝气，交相辉映。要说兴趣，比阔才是他们真正的兴趣。若碰上不识相的人，即使进去，其状也如异教徒窥探人家坐禅，全不解其中味。
    一些温州人不管钱多钱少，必办两件大事：盖房造坟。我曾在乐清县参观过一农民新造的房子。工程总造价为６０万，四四方方的一座四层楼，内外装修豪华，上下皆是铝合金门窗，茶色玻璃。在北京造这样的房子至少要１５０万元。据当地人讲，这还不是最高级的。坐在汽车里，看青山绿水之中，满目是刺眼的椅子坟。司机介绍说，现在已有花５０万元造一座坟的事了。在很多方面，消费的竞争日趋激烈，“比学赶帮超”，花样迭出。不讲花多少钱，但求一鸣惊人成为许多人的心态。有些没有钱的年轻人也在消费上不甘落后，出现了“低收入、高消费”的现象，人可以累倒，但挥金不能手软。
    消费是一种精神的最大娱乐，即使办丧事也是这样。有次我夜宿苍南县委招待所，一大早被一阵巨大声浪吵醒，窗外有条好几里长的人链在蠕动，原来是送葬的队伍。不奏哀乐，却猛劲地吹打《在希望的田野上》、《祝酒歌》等，人群在喜气洋洋的气氛中行进。本来的悲事，在吹吹打打中化解为大喜大庆了。
    对相当多的温州青年来说，消费就是目的。物质消费远不是生存的第一需要。他们要吃活的河鳗，河鳗一旦死掉，价跌的厉害，但有钱的决不会去吃。１９８８年内地抢购风充其量是冲击了商店里有使用价值的消费品，但温州人的目光早已超越。有些姑娘使用香水，必须是法国的，德国、美国的万万使不得。她们不管脚下的烂泥臭街，也不在乎哪种香型对国人的黄皮肤是否合适。钱花到了数就成，就快乐，生活就充满阳光。一位腰缠万贯的个体户坦率地告诉我，他第一信钱，第二信花钱。
    温州的畸形消费已引起不少人的忧虑。有的青少年学着大人样“一掷千金”，而手头又没有这么多钱，于是走上了犯罪道路。对于大多数工人、农民和知识分子来说，超前消费是一种奢望，他们的收入远远达不到为看一位影星而扔出几张“大团结”的程度。超前消费对于社会环境也有着不可低估的消极影响，不少人把轻易丢掉中国传统的“勤俭”、“朴素”美德视为一大憾事。对于成长中的广大青少年来说，他们需要的不仅仅是物质条件，还需要丰富的精神财富。乐于消费的温州人，不知是否想到了这一点？
