A comprehensive service system for rural industries, led by science and technology, with products as the "dragon head," enterprises as the carrier, and experts as the backbone, is emerging and becoming increasingly perfect in various places in Zhejiang.

It is understood that at present, Zhejiang Province has more than 10,000 professional associations and over 1,000 farmer technical service organizations around various agricultural and livestock industries. The composition and service methods of these service systems are diverse: there are privately-run research institutes providing technical guidance, professional companies offering paid services, self-service professional associations, "Star Project" development types, and science and technology-led production and operation cooperation types. Many of these have integrated research, production, and operations, beginning to provide full-process services from pre-production, in-production, to post-production, and "one-stop" services for technology, information, funds, materials, and sales. This has formed a scale of operations. For example, the chickens in Yiwu, tea in Wuyi, geese in Jinyun, bees in Cixi, fish in Haiyan, rabbits in Shengxian, and monkey heads in Changshan have begun to break through industry boundaries, forming the embryonic form of a county-level full-process service system.

A few years ago, Yiwu's rural areas saw a boom in chicken farming. Initially, many farmers were anxious because they couldn't buy chicks. Later, they worried about finding a market for tens of thousands of commercial chickens. This anxiety and worry pushed the Yiwu City Livestock Service Company, which originally only provided in-production technical services, to extend its services to pre-production and post-production. Now, it has developed into 13 service items, including technical training, prevention and treatment of chicken diseases, provision of chicks, drugs, feed, and product marketing. Series services have promoted the development of the city's chicken farming industry. Last year, the number of chickens raised by professional households reached 1.25 million, equivalent to the total of traditional scattered farming by 160,000 households in the city, becoming one of the city's three major livestock industries.

　　浙江农村完善服务体系    
    带动农户扩大经营规模
    据新华社杭州５月８日电  （记者唐庆忠）一个以科技为先导、以产品为“龙头”、以企业为载体、以能人为骨干的农村产业全程服务体系，正在浙江各地崭露头角并日趋完善。
    据了解，目前浙江全省农村围绕种植、养殖各业，出现了上万个专业协会、１０００多个农民技术服务组织。这些服务体系的组成形式和服务方式多种多样：有民办科研所技术辅导型、专业公司有偿服务型、专业协会自我服务型、“星火”项目发展型和以科技为先导的生产经营联合型等。其中不少已把科研、生产、经营融为一体，开始产前、产中、产后全程服务和技术、信息、资金、物料、购销“一条龙”服务，形成了规模经营。如义乌的鸡、武义的茶、缙云的鹅、慈溪的蜂、海盐的鱼、嵊县的兔、常山的猴头菇等，已开始打破行业界限，形成县级全程服务体系雏型。
    前几年义乌农村出现养鸡热，开始许多农民因买不到鸡苗而着急，后来又为数万只商品鸡找不到销路而犯愁。这一急一愁，把原来只从事产中技术服务的义乌市畜产服务公司“逼上梁山”，把服务向产前、产后两头伸延。现在已发展到技术培训、防治鸡瘟、提供鸡苗、药品、饲料和经营产品等１３个服务项目。系列化服务促进了全市养鸡业的发展，去年养鸡专业户饲养量达１２５万只，相当于全市１６万农户传统散养的总和，成为全市３大畜牧产业之一。
