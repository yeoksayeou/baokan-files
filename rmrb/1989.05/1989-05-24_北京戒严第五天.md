More than 170 bus routes have resumed operation, the subway around the city is running, traffic police are on duty, and the city's traffic network is basically unobstructed. Although daily life is returning to normal, people's concern about the situation is growing.

Following the cold wind and rain on May 23, Beijing experienced a scorching sun on May 24. The health of the students who have been enduring the elements at Tiananmen Square has been a concern for Beijing residents. The flow of people bringing clothes, food, and medicine to the petitioning students, which began in the evening of May 23, continued until the early morning of May 24. Medical staff, who had been busy for days treating fasting students, are now busy spraying disinfectant to prevent the spread of disease. University students have organized visiting teams to express their gratitude to the medical staff.

There are still sporadic parades on Chang'an Avenue and around the square. Some traffic intersections, where barriers have been removed, still gather many citizens at night.

According to a report in yesterday's Beijing Evening News, the health of the students sitting in and petitioning is improving, while the number of students from other provinces who have fallen ill in Beijing is increasing. The soldiers of the martial law troops blocked outside the city have seen a sharp decline in their resistance.

According to staff at Beijing Railway Station, the number of students entering and leaving the city from other provinces is roughly equal each day.

    继２３日凄风苦雨后，北京昨天烈日当空。天安门广场上广大栉风沐雨的学生的健康状况受到北京市民关怀。２３日傍晚出现的为请愿学生送衣服、食品、药物的人流，一直持续到２４日清晨。前些天为救护绝食同学忙得一刻不停的医务人员，现在正忙着喷洒消毒药水，以防疾病蔓延。大学生则组织慰问团，向医务人员表示感谢。
    长安街头及广场周围，仍有零星游行队伍出现。一些已拆除路障的交通路口，入夜仍聚集着很多市民。
    据昨天的《北京晚报》报道，目前静坐请愿学生的健康状况趋向好转，外地来京学生病倒者增多，被阻于城外的戒严部队战士身体抵抗力急剧下降。
    据北京车站有关人员介绍，外地学生每天进出人数大体相当。
