American President Bush today delivered a speech at the University of Texas, outlining his policy towards the Soviet Union.

Bush has been in the White House for over three months, just completed a review of U.S.-Soviet relations, and this is the first time he has comprehensively elaborated on U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union.

Bush said that it is now time to move beyond the "containment policy" and towards a new policy for the 1990s. The United States' goal is not just to "simply contain Soviet expansionism," but to integrate the Soviet Union with other societies. "There is no doubt that we sincerely hope to see Soviet reforms continue and succeed," he said. However, this is only the beginning of a new path, and there are still many dangers and uncertainties ahead. We must not forget that the Soviet Union has a formidable military capability, and we must maintain a strong military force.

Bush then outlined five specific steps he expects the Soviet Union to take:

1. Reduce Soviet military forces to a level that matches its legitimate security needs and poses less of a threat;
2. Support the self-determination rights of Eastern and Central European countries and abandon the Brezhnev Doctrine;
3. Work with the West to take practical measures to resolve regional disputes through diplomatic means;
4. Respect human rights; he said that if the Soviet Union enacts an emigration law, he will ask Congress to repeal the Jackson-Vanik Amendment and grant the Soviet Union most-favored-nation status;
5. Work with the United States to address urgent global issues such as drugs and environmental protection.

Regarding the issue of arms control, Bush said that the United States seeks to reach verifiable, stable arms control and disarmament agreements with the Soviet Union and its allies. The United States' basic attitude towards strategic weapons negotiations is to reduce the risk of nuclear war. For defense and space weapons negotiations, Bush insists on retaining the option to deploy advanced defense systems. He also said that the United States will continue to seek a verifiable treaty to ban chemical weapons and support NATO's efforts in the conventional forces negotiations in Europe to reduce the Soviet threat of attack.

　　布什阐述对苏政策    
    要求苏联采取五项积极步骤
    本报华盛顿５月１２日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什今天在得克萨斯大学发表演说，阐述其对苏政策。
    布什入主白宫３个多月，刚刚完成对美苏关系的回顾，这是他第一次较全面阐述美国对苏政策。
    布什说，现在已到了跨出“遏制政策”、走向９０年代的新政策的时候，美国的目标不仅仅是“简单地遏制苏联扩张主义”，而是要使苏联与各国社会融为一体。“不容置疑，我们真诚地希望看到苏联改革继续下去并取得成功”，但现在只是新道路的开始，前面还有许多危险和不肯定因素，决不能忘记苏联有着可怕的军事能力，我们必须保持强大的军事实力。
    布什接着要求苏联采取以下５项积极步骤：
    １、削减苏联军事力量，把它的军力削减到与其合法安全需要相符、威胁性更小的水平；
    ２、支持东欧、中欧国家的自决权利，放弃勃列日涅夫主义；
    ３、同西方一起采取实际措施，通过外交途径解决地区争端；
    ４、尊重人权；他说，如果苏联制订出移民出境法，他将要求国会放弃杰克逊—瓦尼克修正案，给苏联以最惠国待遇；
    ５、与美国一起处理紧迫的全球性问题，如毒品、环保等。
    关于裁军问题，布什说，美国寻求同苏联及其盟国达成可核查的、稳定的军控和裁军协议。美国对战略武器谈判的基本态度是减少核战争危险。对于防御和太空武器谈判，布什坚持保留部署先进防御系统的各种选择。他还说，美国将继续寻求达成可核查的禁止化学武器条约，并支持北约在欧洲常规力量谈判中为减少苏联进攻威胁的努力。
