Ren Jianxin Calls for Exposing Corruption in the Courts
Court Personnel Should Be Strictly Disciplined
Over 300 Judges and Court Officers Punished for Bribery and Misconduct Last Year

People's Daily, Beijing, May 6th - Reporter Mao Lei: Judges and court officers, who hold the power of life and death and decide right from wrong, had 383 individuals disciplined for illegal and improper conduct last year, with 18 of them facing criminal charges.

This was revealed by Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, at today's national conference on judicial integrity.

Ren Jianxin pointed out that the courts are not a clear pool of water. Although these corrupt behaviors occur in a minority, they tarnish the reputation of the courts, damage the image of the Party and the state, and directly harm the interests of the people.

Zhang Kaiyu, the president of Binhai County Court in Jiangsu, last March, at the request of Suiyang County Court President Liu Xuncai, privately instructed a courtroom director to change the sentence of Liu's brother, who was convicted of hooliganism, from two years in prison to acquittal, blatantly abusing his power and perverting justice.

From the cases of illegal and improper conduct that have been uncovered, various forms of corruption and evil practices in society are reflected in the court system. There are those who accept bribes, take gifts, extort money, and pervert justice; those who embezzle and misappropriate public funds, divide up lawsuit fees; those who engage in speculation, sell cars, steal, and defraud; those who gamble, watch obscene videos, engage in prostitution, and rape female litigants, and so on.

In January last year, two court officers, Xu Xingfu and Zhang Yonghe, from Zhuozi County Court in Inner Mongolia, colluded with three criminals to lure them with the purchase of gold, and twice robbed over 200 grams of sand gold. Xu and Zhang were each sentenced to eight years in prison.

Zeng Xiancai, who was sentenced to ten years in prison, once served as a judge in the Double Dragon Court of Xishui County Court in Guizhou. In handling a divorce lawsuit, he actually abducted and sold two female litigants, and raped one of them.

Ren Jianxin admitted that there are still some illegal and improper conduct issues that have not been discovered. He analyzed that the reason for this phenomenon is that during the reform process, the transition from the old to the new system has not been completed, the new order of socialist commodity economy is yet to be established, various social activities have not yet been strictly regulated by legal means, and the national supervision system and social supervision institutions are not yet strict, leaving many loopholes. Under these circumstances, it is easy to breed and spread the phenomenon of buying power with money and selling power with money between departments that manage power and business entities, which will inevitably reflect in the court's trial work.

Ren Jianxin expressed his welcome to people's representatives, political advisors, democratic parties, people's organizations, news media, and the public to expose negative and corrupt issues in the courts. He also emphasized that after the problems are uncovered, they must be dealt with seriously, especially for those who abuse their power to pervert justice and sell the law, they must be severely punished according to party discipline and state law, those who should be disciplined will be disciplined, those who should be expelled will be expelled, and those who should be held criminally responsible will be held criminally responsible, and will not be lenient or indulgent.

　　任建新呼吁各界揭发法院腐败现象    
    法院队伍更应从严整肃
    去年三百多法官法警因贪赃枉法受惩处
    本报北京５月６日讯  记者毛磊报道：掌握老百姓生杀予夺、裁判是非曲直大权的人民法官和法警，去年有３８３人因违法违纪受到纪律处分，另有１８人被依法追究刑事责任。
    这是最高人民法院院长任建新在今天召开的全国法院廉政建设工作会议上透露的。
    任建新指出，法院不是清水一潭。这些腐败行为尽管发生在少数人身上，但它玷污了法院的声誉，败坏了党和国家的形象，直接损害了人民群众的利益。
    江苏滨海县法院院长张开宇，去年３月受射阳县法院院长刘训侃托情，私自指使一名法庭庭长为犯有流氓罪的刘训侃之弟将判处有期徒刑二年改判为无罪，公然徇私舞弊，枉法裁判。
    从被查处的违法违纪问题看，社会上形形色色的腐败丑恶现象，几乎在法院队伍中都有反映。有吃请受礼，索贿受贿，贪赃枉法的；有贪污挪用公款、私分诉讼费的；有投机倒把，倒卖汽车、钢材、假酒、彩电的；有抢劫、诈骗、敲诈勒索的；有赌博、观看淫秽录相、嫖娼、奸淫女当事人的等等。
    内蒙古卓资县法院法警徐幸福、张永和，去年１月勾结３名犯罪分子，以收买黄金为诱饵，两次抢劫沙金２００多克。徐、张２人各被判处有期徒刑８年。
    被判处有期徒刑１０年的曾宪才，曾担任贵州习水县法院双龙法庭审判员，他在办理离婚诉讼中，竟将两名女当事人拐骗出卖，并强奸了其中１人。
    任建新承认，还有一些违法违纪问题没被发现。他分析这种现象产生的原因是，在改革过程中新旧体制转变尚未完成，社会主义商品经济新秩序还有待确立，各种社会活动尚未通过法制形式达到严密规范的程度，国家监督系统和社会监督机构还不严密，留有不少漏洞。在这种情况下，很容易滋生蔓延掌管权力的部门与经营主体之间以钱买权、以权换钱的腐败现象，它必然反映到法院的审判工作上来。
    任建新表示，欢迎人大代表、政协委员、民主党派、人民团体、新闻舆论和群众检举揭发法院消极腐败问题。他还强调，问题查清后，一定要严肃处理，尤其对利用职权徇私枉法、贪赃卖法的，要严惩不贷，依照党纪国法，该处分的处分、该开除的开除、该追究刑事责任的追究刑事责任，决不姑息迁就。
