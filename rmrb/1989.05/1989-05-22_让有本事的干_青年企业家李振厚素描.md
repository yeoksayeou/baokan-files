Let the Capable Do It
— A Sketch of Young Entrepreneur Li Zhenhu

By Duán Xīnqiáng, People's Daily Reporter

"This is a factory that's impossible to wake up, even Ma Shengli sent people to turn it around and it didn't work. Can you make a difference?"

"Let's give it a try." Li Zhenhu, the director of the Hai Cheng City Asphalt Paper Factory in Liaoning Province, was very confident. He signed a contract with the Anshan City Light Industry Bureau to take over the Anshan Paper Factory, which had been losing money for four consecutive years. Starting from March 4th, he ended the history of monthly losses of tens of thousands of yuan and made a profit of 10,000 yuan. By the 4th of this month, one month later, the paper production increased from the original 20-plus tons per month to over 200 tons.

What a remarkable Li Zhenhu! At just 33 years old, he is not tall, but his energy and drive are like the liquefied gas in a gas cylinder, full of vigor. In September 1987, he leased the long-losing Asphalt Paper Factory, making a profit of 122,000 yuan in three months. In 1988, the per capita tax revenue was over 10,000 yuan, ranking first among collective enterprises in Anshan City. That year, he also took over the struggling Niuzhuang Farm Tools Factory, the Line Material Factory which had lost 90,000 yuan in four months, the Rubber Factory No. 2 which owed 520,000 yuan in external debts, the Smelting Factory which had accumulated losses of 550,000 yuan, and the Comprehensive Factory which couldn't even pay wages. At the same time, he collaborated with Chi Feng to establish a compound fertilizer factory. That year, all the factories made profits, generating a tax revenue of 2 million yuan...

After graduating from high school, Li Zhenhu worked in a township enterprise for ten years. The factories he took over had a common characteristic: the leaders lacked ability; those with ability couldn't become leaders. After leasing, Li Zhenhu broke down the barriers between cadres and workers. Regardless of who they were, they participated in recruitment examinations. He invited the education department to test cultural and scientific knowledge, and he also tested policies and management levels, competing on an equal footing. Those who passed, worked; those who didn't, were let go. Promotions and demotions were all linked to wages. The Asphalt Paper Factory originally had 33 cadres, and 17 were dismissed after the examination. The original office director had poor work skills and didn't pass the exam, becoming a night watchman with a reduced salary of several tens of yuan; the worker Li Chengang from the Line Material Factory had technical skills, knew management, and was good at business. Moreover, he was eloquent and capable, so everyone respected him. He was appointed as the deputy director of the Second Rubber Factory, and his salary increased from 80 yuan to 180 yuan. Under his leadership, the produced rubber pads and tires were very popular in the market.

Workers had a traditional mindset: once they entered the factory and got commercial grain, it was like planting iron-stemmed sorghum, guaranteed harvest regardless of drought or flood, equivalent to having "insurance." Therefore, some people worked without guaranteeing quality or quantity. Li Zhenhu implemented an optimized combination in the factory. Regardless of who they were, if they were in the combination, they worked; if they weren't in the combination and couldn't find a place, they were unemployed within the factory; if there was a shortage of talents, they were recruited from society.

Li Zhenhu implemented a piecework wage system based on job positions, truly achieving the principle of "the more you work, the more you earn." The driver Sun Jianjun of the Asphalt Paper Factory worked overtime and drove fast, earning more income. Some workers took more leave or had low efficiency, only earning a few tens of yuan a month, widening the gap, and no one dared to be lazy.

　　让有本事的干
    ——青年企业家李振厚素描
    本报记者  段心强
    “这可是个睡着叫不醒的厂子，马胜利派人来都没扭亏为盈，你能干出名堂？”
    “试试。”辽宁省海城市油毡纸厂厂长李振厚很自信，与鞍山市一轻局签了合同，从３月４日开始承包连续亏损４年的鞍山造纸厂。当月，结束了每月亏损十几万元的历史，盈利１万元。到本月４日一个月，纸产量由原来每月２０多吨上升到２００多吨。
    好一个李振厚，只有３３岁，个头不高，那精力、干劲，真像煤气罐里的液化气，冲劲大。１９８７年９月租赁了长年亏损的油毡纸厂，３个月赢利１２．２万，１９８８年人均创利税１万多元，居鞍山市集体企业之首。这年他接着兼并了处于困境中的牛庄农具厂，４个月亏损９万元的线材厂，欠外债５２万元的橡胶二厂，累计亏损５５万元的熔炼厂和开不出工资的综合厂。同时和赤峰联办复合肥厂。当年，各个厂都盈利，创利税２００万元……
    李振厚高中毕业后在乡办企业干了十年。原来他接手的这些厂，有个共同的特点：当领导的没本事；有本事当不了领导。李振厚租赁后，打破干部工人的界限，不管是谁，参加招聘考试，请教育部门考文化科学知识，他也参与考政策、经营水平，平等竞争。考上了，干；考不上，下。上下变动，都与工资挂钩。油毡纸厂原有干部３３名，一考考掉１７名。原办公室主任工作能力太差，没考上，当了更夫，工资减少几十元；线材厂工人李成刚有技术、会管理、善经营，而且嘴一份子，手一份子，大家服，聘为第二橡胶厂任副厂长，工资由８０元上升为１８０元。在他主持下，生产出的胶垫和轮胎，在市场上很畅销。
    职工有个传统心理：进了厂，吃上商品粮，就像种下铁秆高粱，旱涝保收，等于上了“保险”。因此一些人干活既不保质，又不保量。李振厚在厂里推行优化组合。在职人员，不管是谁，组合上，干；组合不上，自己又找不到地方，厂内待业；缺少的人才，到社会上找。
    李振厚在岗位定员的基础上实行计件工资，真正做到干多少活拿多少钱。油毡纸厂驾驶员孙建军加班加点，多装快跑收入就高。有的工人请假多或者效率低，一月只领几十块钱，差距拉开了，谁也不偷懒。
