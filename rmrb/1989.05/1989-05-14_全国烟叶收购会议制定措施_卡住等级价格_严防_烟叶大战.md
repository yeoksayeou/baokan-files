The reporter Mo Xinyuan learned from the nationwide tobacco leaf procurement conference that to strengthen the tobacco leaf procurement work, the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration will this year collaborate with the State Bureau of Technical Supervision to form a quality inspection team. This team will conduct on-site and in-factory inspections to verify the quality of tobacco leaf grades.

According to the current information held by the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, the tobacco leaf planting area this year can be stabilized at around 16 million mu, roughly the same as last year. The prominent issue in this year's tobacco leaf procurement is that the procurement grades and quality seriously do not meet national standards. There is a widespread phenomenon of grade inflation and adulteration, and in some places, there are varying degrees of "tobacco leaf wars," with tobacco smuggling activities rampant.

At this conference, the tobacco departments of major tobacco-producing provinces and adjacent regions signed boundary agreements to unify the implementation of national quality standards and price policies to prevent the recurrence of "tobacco leaf wars."

On May 14, Jiang Ming, Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration, stated at the closing of the conference that the quality standards set by the state are protected by law. In recent years, various places have adopted various supporting policies to motivate tobacco farmers, which we welcome. However, these supporting measures should not be realized during procurement to avoid causing price chaos and encouraging a rush to buy. He emphasized the need to strictly enforce discipline, rectify the organization, and strictly implement national policies. For acts such as disguised price increases, bribery, embezzlement, and collusion with tobacco smugglers, they must be resolutely investigated and punished, with no leniency or tolerance.

### 全国烟叶收购会议制定措施  卡住等级价格　严防“烟叶大战”

　　全国烟叶收购会议制定措施    
    卡住等级价格　严防“烟叶大战”
    本报讯  记者莫新元从全国烟叶收购会议获悉：为加强烟叶收购工作，国家烟草专卖局今年将同国家技术监督局联合组成质量检验组，巡回和驻厂检查验收烟叶等级质量。
    据国家烟草专卖局目前掌握的情况，今年全国烟叶种植面积可以稳定在１６００万亩左右，大体与去年持平。今年烟叶收购中突出的问题是收购等级质量严重不符合国家标准，松级抬价、掺杂使假现象相当普遍，个别地方出现不同程度的“烟叶大战”，烟贩活动猖獗。
    在这次会议上，主要产烟省区毗邻地区的烟草部门为了防止“烟叶大战”再起，签订了统一执行国家质量标准和价格政策的边界协议。
    国家烟草专卖局局长江明１４日在会议闭幕时指出，国家制定的质量标准，受到法律的保护。这几年各地为调动烟农积极性，采取了各种扶持政策，我们是欢迎的，但是这些扶持措施不应该在收购中兑现，以免造成价格混乱，助长抢购风。他强调要严肃纪律，整顿组织，严格执行国家政策。对变相加价、行贿受贿、冒领私分、与烟贩内外勾结等违法行为，要坚决查处，决不姑息迁就。
