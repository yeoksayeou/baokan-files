Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 27th — The main equipment for the first phase of China's first self-designed and constructed nuclear power plant, the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang, is being installed one by one. The main pipelines have begun welding, and it is expected to start generating electricity next year.

The first phase of the Qin Mountain Nuclear Power Plant has an installed capacity of 300,000 kilowatts and began construction on June 1, 1983. So far, 65% of the investment has been completed. In the plant area by Hangzhou Bay, the core equipment of the nuclear power plant—the reactor pressure vessel—has been successfully hoisted. The safety shell of the main reactor building has been successfully sealed, and the auxiliary buildings of the reactor, the steam turbine generator building, the main control room building, and the fuel building on both sides of the main building have also been basically completed.

Currently, the equipment being installed includes steam generators, titanium tube condensers, deaerators, and high-pressure heaters. Some public facilities in the plant area, such as machine repair shops, refrigeration workshops, and boiler rooms, will also be completed this year.

　　浙江秦山核电厂
    明年可投产发电
    新华社杭州５月２７日电  （记者曹银康）我国自行设计建造的第一座核电厂——浙江秦山核电厂一期工程主要设备正在陆续就位，主管道开始焊接，预计明年将可投产发电。
    秦山核电厂第一期工程装机容量为３０万千瓦，于１９８３年６月１日破土兴建，目前已完成投资的６５％。在杭州湾畔的厂区内，核电厂的核心设备——反应堆压力容器已吊装成功，反应堆主厂房安全壳已经顺利封顶，主厂房两侧的反应堆辅助厂房和汽轮发电机厂房以及主控制室楼和燃料厂房也已基本竣工。
    目前，正在安装的有蒸气发生器钛管冷凝器、除氧气水箱、高压加热器等。厂区的一些公共设施，如机修间、制冷车间、锅炉房等，也将在今年陆续完成。
