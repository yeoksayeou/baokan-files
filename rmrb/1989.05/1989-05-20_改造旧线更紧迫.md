	Upgrading Old Lines is More Urgent
		By Lü Yinhua, Policy Research Office, Ministry of Railways

	To achieve self-renewal and development, railways must address two critical tasks: upgrading old lines to enhance their transport capacity and accelerating the construction of new lines to complete the national railway network. Upgrading old lines is particularly urgent.

	On old lines, from 1981 to 1987, the average annual increase in passenger and freight transport density per kilometer of railway in China was 123 million ton-kilometers, which is three times that of the Soviet Union. The sheer volume of transport and the speed of growth are unprecedented globally. However, China's railway equipment level lags far behind many countries. This approach seems efficient on the surface, but in reality, it is like drinking poison to quench thirst, fraught with dangers. Railway transport products involve the movement of people and goods, which cannot be stored like industrial or agricultural products to balance supply and demand. Therefore, it is essential to have a significant reserve in transport capacity. Many countries require railway transport capacity to be used at no more than 85% before conducting technical upgrades to expand capacity. In China, many railway lines and marshalling yards not only fail to meet the increasing annual transport demands but also lack the necessary reserves for daily operations. In 1987, out of over 400 sections nationwide, 135 were at full capacity or overloaded, and out of 38 major marshalling yards, 23 were at full capacity or overloaded. It is clear that the task of upgrading old lines is enormous.

	In terms of new line construction, over 9 million square kilometers of territory has only about 50,000 kilometers of railway. In the past few five-year plans, nearly 1,000 kilometers of railway were built annually. However, when railways became the most prominent weak link in the national economy, during the "Five-Year Plan" and "Sixth Five-Year Plan," only 435 kilometers of railway were built annually over ten years, marking a historical regression. The severe lag in new line construction, especially in economically developed regions where networks have not been formed, has led to an increasing concentration of passenger and freight volumes on existing main lines, causing these lines to bear heavier loads and creating a vicious cycle. Preliminary estimates indicate that even if 1,500 kilometers of railway are built annually in the last decade of this century, by the year 2000, the total railway mileage will only reach 70,000 kilometers, while the total transport volume will increase by 30% to 40%, making railway transport remain very tight.

### 改造旧线更紧迫

　　改造旧线更紧迫
    铁道部政策研究室  吕荫华
    铁路要进行自我更新和发展，必须正视肩上的两副重担：一是对旧线进行技术改造，增强其运输能力；二是加速新线建设，尽快建成全国铁路网。而且改造旧线更显得紧迫。
    旧线上，１９８１—１９８７年我国铁路每公里的客货运输密度年平均增加１２３万吨公里，相当于苏联的３倍。运输负荷量之大，增长速度之快，是举世罕见的，但是我国铁路的装备水平却远远落后于许多国家。这样做，表面看来效率很高，但实际上是饮鸩止渴，危机四伏。铁路运输产品是人和物的位移，产品本身不像工农业生产那样可以储备，以丰补歉。因此要求在运输能力上有较大储备，许多国家要求铁路运输能力的使用率不超过８５％时就进行技术改造，扩大能力。而我国铁路许多线路、编组站不仅没有满足运量逐年剧增的能力需要，就连日常运输所必需的后备也日益枯竭，１９８７年全路４００多个区段中有１３５个、３８个主要编组站中有２３个的使用率达到饱和或超饱和。应该看到，旧线改造的任务是相当艰巨的。
    新线建设上，９００多万平方公里的国土上仅有５万多公里铁路。前几个五年计划年修铁路近１０００公里，而当铁路成为国民经济最突出的薄弱环节时，“五五”、“六五”十年内年修铁路仅４３５公里，形成了历史的倒退。新线建设的严重滞后，在经济发达地区没有成网，使客货运量越来越集中在已有的干线上，导致这些干线负荷日益加重，形成恶性循环。初步测算本世纪最后十年，即使年修建铁路１５００公里，到２０００年铁路里程也只达到７万公里，总负荷量却增加３０％—４０％，铁路运输仍将十分紧张。
