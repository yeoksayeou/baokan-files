The Ministry of Commerce and the Agricultural Bank of China recently informed reporters that there is a significant shortage of funds for the summer procurement of grains and oils, with numerous problems arising. According to estimates, there is a shortfall of approximately 10 billion yuan. Without concrete measures, the practice of issuing IOUs during procurement is likely to become more prevalent.

The People's Daily for Agriculture reported that currently, the small spring crops are in the peak procurement season. In provinces like Zhejiang and Sichuan, the procurement of tea leaves and live pigs has already, to varying degrees, resulted in the issuance of IOUs to farmers.

Southern provinces are about to begin harvesting, and the demand for procurement funds is high. Anhui Province's total summer procurement value is 2.37 billion yuan. Despite the maximum efforts of various departments, there is still a shortfall of 500 million yuan. In Henan's Zhumadian region, it is estimated that there is a one-third shortfall in procurement funds for contracted grains and oils, and there is no way to handle the non-contracted portion. Although coastal areas in Shandong have relatively ample funds, they anticipate that all negotiated and transferred procurement will result in the issuance of IOUs. Provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hebei, and Jiangsu are all worried about the lack of funds.

The Agricultural Bank and the Ministry of Commerce, which are responsible for the summer procurement funds, stated that the local authorities face difficulties, and they face even greater challenges. This summer, the procurement of grains and oils requires approximately 20 billion yuan, with the Agricultural Bank needing to cover more than half. They have repeatedly reported to the central bank, but so far, they have only received a temporary loan of 1 billion yuan, with the rest to be resolved by the Agricultural Bank. The Agricultural Bank stated that even by maximizing their potential and clearing up funds, they can only supply 4 to 5 billion yuan, and there is no solution for the remaining half. The Ministry of Commerce's situation is that the fiscal authorities have not yet disbursed 5.5 billion yuan for last year's procurement premiums and policy-related losses by the end of the year, and their own capabilities are weak, so they request the Agricultural Bank to resolve the issue. The Agricultural Bank's stance is: strive to guarantee contracted procurement, and support negotiated procurement as much as possible.

Currently, the ratio of contracted procurement to market prices is 1:3, making procurement already difficult. Without cash payments, who would be willing to sell? If farmers selling summer grains do not receive payment, they will not be able to invest in autumn grain production. Autumn is the peak season for grain procurement, so what will be procured then?

### 商业担忧，银行发愁，谁解燃眉之急？夏季粮油收购资金短缺百亿

　　商业担忧，银行发愁，谁解燃眉之急？   
    夏季粮油收购资金短缺百亿
    本报讯  商业部、中国农业银行最近向记者反映，夏季粮油收购资金缺口大，问题多。据匡算，约有百亿元左右资金难以落实。再拿不出硬措施，收购打白条现象将会愈演愈烈。
    农民日报的报道说，眼下，小春作物已到收购旺季，浙江、四川等地收购茶叶、生猪中已不同程度地给农民打了白条。
    南方诸省即将开镰，收购资金需求呼声很高。安徽省夏季收购总值２３．７亿元，各部门尽最大努力，还有５亿元缺口。河南驻马店地区预计，合同内粮油收购资金短缺１／３，定购外根本没有办法。山东沿海资金相对宽松，但他们预计所有议转平收购都将打白条。两湖、两广、河北、江苏等地都在为钱着急。
    承担夏季收购资金的农行、商业两家的同志说，地方难，他们更难。今年夏季粮、油收购等共需资金２００多亿元左右，农行要解决一半以上，他们多次向中央银行报告，到目前只得到１０亿元的临时借款，其余让农行解决。农行说，挖潜、清理最多只能供应４０到５０亿元，另一半实在没有办法。商业部门的状况是，去年收购的加价款和政策性亏损，财政到月底还有５５亿元没有拨付，自身能力又很弱，请农行解决。农行的态度是：合同内力争保证，议价收购能支持多少算多少。
    现在合同收购与市场价比已到１∶３，本来就难收，再无现金支付，谁还愿给你。如果交售夏粮农民拿不到钱，就无法投入秋粮生产，秋季是粮食收购的大头，那时还收什么？
