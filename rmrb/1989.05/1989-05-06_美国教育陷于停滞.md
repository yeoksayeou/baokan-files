	U.S. Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos recently announced that an annual study on American education indicates that American education is in a state of stagnation.

	According to the study, the high school graduation rate in the U.S. was 71.7% in 1985, dropped to 71.6% in 1986, and further declined to 71.1% in 1987. Minnesota had the highest graduation rate at 90.6%, while the District of Columbia (Washington D.C.) had the lowest at 55.5%. Wyoming improved significantly from the 25th position in 1982 to the 2nd position in 1987. Michigan, however, saw a significant decline from the 28th position to the 48th position.

	The average score on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) dropped from 906 in 1987 to 904 in 1988 (the lowest possible score is 400 and the highest is 1600). Out of 22 states that use the NAEP as the primary form of college entrance examination, 14 states saw a decline in scores. Out of 28 states that use the American College Testing (ACT) as the primary form of college entrance examination, 11 states saw a decline in scores.

	Secretary Cavazos said, "Over the past three years, American education has not made any progress. It is hard to say why. I still believe that we have not focused enough on the important issue of making everyone care about educating children. This is not a matter of money."

　　美国教育陷于停滞
    本报讯  美国教育部长劳罗·卡瓦佐斯日前宣布说，对美国教育工作的一项年度研究报告表明，美国教育陷于停滞状态。
    根据这项研究，美国高中毕业率１９８５年为７１．７％，１９８６年降为７１．６０％，１９８７年又降至７１．１％。明尼苏达州高中毕业率为９０．６％，名列前茅；哥伦比亚特区（即首都华盛顿所在地）只有５５．５％，为全国倒数第一；根据上述比例所排定的名次，怀俄明州从１９８２年的第２５位上升至１９８７年的第二位，进步最为显著；密执安州则从第２８位跌至第４８位，退步幅度最大。
    美国全国“学业能力测验”平均分从１９８７年的９０６降至１９８８年的９０４（这种测验的最低分为４００，最高分为１６００）。在２２个以“学业能力测验”为高考主要形式的州中，１４个州的分数都有下降。在２８个以“美国大学测验大纲”为高考主要形式的州中，有１１个州的成绩在下降。
    教育部长卡瓦佐斯说：“三年来，美国教育未取得任何进步。这很难说为什么。我仍然认为我们还没有把注意力集中到努力使每个人都关心教育孩子这个重要问题上。这不是一个金钱的问题。”
