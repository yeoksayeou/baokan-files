The general manager of Shenyang Jinbei Automobile Co., Ltd., Zhao Xiyou, insists on riding a bicycle to and from work every day, which has become a well-known story among the employees.

At 55 years old, Zhao Xiyou now has a head full of white hair. His home is about six or seven kilometers away from the company, and it takes more than half an hour to ride to work. Throughout the year, except for a few days with particularly bad weather, whether it is in the hot summer or the cold winter, the staff in the company's office will always see the general manager's dusty figure.

It has become a common practice for enterprise leaders to have cars to take them to and from work. Even the managers of small factories with only a few hundred people also have dedicated cars. Workers say: This is not riding in a car, but sitting in a sedan chair.

　　汽车“老板”骑车上下班
    新华社沈阳５月２８日电  （记者李玲、刘欣欣）沈阳金杯汽车股份有限公司总经理赵希友坚持常年骑自行车上下班，被职工们传为美谈。
    ５５岁的赵希友如今已满头白发，他家离公司有六七公里，每天骑车到单位要半个多小时。一年中除少数特别恶劣的天气外，不论是盛夏还是严冬，公司机关的同志都会看到总经理风尘仆仆的身影。
    企业领导干部上下班车接车送早已成为一种风气。一些二三百人小厂的厂长上下班也要坐专车。工人说：这不是在坐车而是在“坐轿”。
