Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 7th.

The relationship between India and Nepal is currently in a stalemate. The Indian side has repeatedly expressed its willingness to negotiate with Nepal, but there are no signs that it is taking any proactive steps to resolve the stalemate.

Indian Foreign Minister Rao said on May 5th that India will consider its "primary security interests" when formulating its policy towards Nepal. He said that India is ready to negotiate with Nepal.

Nepal's Foreign Minister Upadhyaya visited New Delhi from March 26th to 27th and presented drafts of bilateral trade and transit treaties to India. A Nepalese government spokesman said on May 4th that Nepal is awaiting a "specific and clear" response from the Indian government.

In reality, India has rejected Nepal's proposed treaty drafts and has not put forward any new proposals.

India wants to sign a treaty with Nepal regarding trade and transit, linking Nepal's transit rights with bilateral trade.

Nepal hopes to separate these two issues, arguing that transit is a long-term right enjoyed by landlocked countries as stipulated by international law.

Since the expiration of the two countries' trade and transit treaties on March 23rd, India has announced that it will not renew the treaties, simultaneously closing 13 of the 15 transit points on the Indo-Nepal border, and stopping the supply of essential goods to Nepal, leading to serious economic difficulties in Nepal.

Since India is in a dominant position, it seems to be in no hurry to take any positive measures to ease the stalemate.

Trade and transit are only part of the issues that have arisen in the relationship between the two countries. The crux of the matter is that India wants its relationship with Nepal to serve its "primary security interests," while Nepal insists on maintaining friendly relations with India on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty, equality, and mutual benefit.

　　陷于僵局的尼印关系
    新华社记者  谭仁侠
    印度同尼泊尔之间的关系目前正陷于僵局，印度方面一再表示愿意与尼泊尔举行谈判，但并没有主动采取行动来解决僵局的迹象。
    印度外长拉奥５日说，印度在制订其对尼政策时，要考虑其“首要的安全利益”。他说，印度已作好同尼谈判的准备。
    尼泊尔外交大臣乌帕德亚亚于３月２６日至２７日访问新德里时已向印度提出两国的贸易条约和过境条约的草案。尼泊尔政府发言人５月４日说，尼泊尔正期待着印度政府作出“具体明确的”反应。
    印度方面实际上拒绝了尼泊尔提出的条约草案，而它又未提出任何新建议。
    印度想与尼泊尔就贸易和过境问题签署一个条约，使尼泊尔的过境权同两国的双边贸易连在一起。
    尼泊尔希望将这两个问题分开，其理由是，过境是国际法所规定的内陆国所享有的长期权利。
    自从３月２３日两国的贸易条约和过境条约期满后，印度宣布不再延续条约，同时关闭了在印尼边界的１５个过境点中的１３个，并停止向尼泊尔提供必需品，导致尼泊尔经济供给出现严重困难。
    由于印度处于主动地位，它似乎不急于采取任何积极措施来缓和僵局。
    贸易和过境实际上仅是两国关系中出现的部分问题，问题的关键是印度想使它与尼泊尔的关系服从于它“首要的安全利益”，而尼泊尔方面则坚持在相互尊重主权、平等和互利的基础上与印度保持友好关系。
