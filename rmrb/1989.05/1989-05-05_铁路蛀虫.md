On the evening of March 22, the 322nd express train on the Chengdu-Kunming line stopped at Ganluo Station. Vendors swarmed onto the train, placing sacks of lead ore on the steps of the car doors facing away from the platform. They then quickly climbed in through the windows, causing the train to become severely unbalanced. As a result, the train conductor dared not depart, and the train was delayed for over an hour before it could slowly start moving. On March 24, a passenger train departing from Ganluo Station dropped a sack of ore from the steps just minutes after leaving the station, narrowly avoiding a serious accident.

According to station staff, "These lead ore vendors frequently travel between Wusi River and Puxiong. They are all unreasonable and we fear they might retaliate secretly." The railway public security bureau is also understaffed and overwhelmed, unable to manage the situation effectively.

Strengthening railway security forces is essential to thoroughly control these "pests."

    铁路蛀虫
    3月22日晚，成昆线322次直快列车，停靠甘洛站时，贩子蜂拥而上，把成袋的铅矿石放到列车背向站台一侧各个车门的车梯上（上图），便匆匆翻窗而入，造成列车严重偏载（下图）。致使车长不敢发车，列车被迫推迟1个多小时才缓慢启动。3月24日，一客车从甘洛站发车十几分钟后，从车梯上掉下一袋矿石，险酿车祸。
    据车站工作人员说：“这些贩铅矿石的人经常往返乌斯河、普雄等地，个个蛮不讲理，我们最怕他们暗地里报复。”铁路公安派出所也势单力薄，顾了东顾不了西，管不了！
    加强铁路治安力量，要彻底治住这些“蛀虫”。
