Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th.

The Ministry of Public Security sent a telegram on May 27th to police officers and armed police forces nationwide, the full text of which is as follows:

Since mid-April, a very small number of people have deliberately created turmoil, starting from Beijing and spreading nationwide. The situation is quite severe. A few individuals with ulterior motives have taken advantage of the patriotic enthusiasm of the majority of students and the public's dissatisfaction with certain mistakes in our work to create turmoil. Their goal is to oppose the Four Cardinal Principles. This is a serious political struggle concerning the fate of the country and the nation. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and local party committees and governments, the broad masses of police officers and armed police forces have stood firm, taken a clear stance, and joined the struggle against turmoil. They have been working day and night, actively and patiently explaining to the public, timely exposing and cracking down on criminal elements who take advantage of the situation to commit crimes, and have been diligent in their duties to restore normal social order and maintain social stability. In the face of complex situations, obstruction by misinformed masses, and attacks by a few lawbreakers, you have considered the bigger picture, strictly adhered to discipline, endured hardships, and avoided harming the public, fully demonstrating the noble qualities of the people's police who love the people. In particular, the police officers and armed police forces in Beijing have shown high political awareness and a spirit of dedication in this struggle. Many comrades have not been home for dozens of days, doing a great deal of work to maintain social order and public security in the capital, and making significant contributions to stabilizing the situation in the capital. The Ministry of Public Security expresses its heartfelt thanks to all police officers, armed police forces, and their families, and extends warm greetings.

The Party Central Committee and the State Council are determined to take resolute measures to stop this turmoil, which reflects the wishes of the people across the country and represents the fundamental interests of the people across the country. You have already shown through your actions that our public security forces are loyal to the Party and the people, a force that the Party and the state can rely on, and a force that firmly supports the correct decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council. We hope that you will continue to strive, seriously study the important speeches by Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun at the Beijing Party, Government, and Military Cadres Conference, further clarify the nature of this struggle, stand firm, take a clear stance, and in political terms, firmly align with the Party Central Committee. In your work, closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to jointly struggle against the turmoil.

You must recognize the complexity and severity of this struggle, maintain a clear mind, and under the leadership of the party committees and governments, maintain confidence, remain calm, obey orders, follow instructions, strictly adhere to discipline, implement policies, and act according to law.

You must carry forward the glorious tradition of the people's police loving the people, further improve police-public relations, rely on the masses, and resolutely crack down on all elements that take advantage of the situation to create disturbances, engage in looting, arson, robbery, and other illegal criminal activities. You must carry forward the fighting spirit of continuous combat and fearlessness of fatigue, and diligently fulfill your duties to maintain normal social order, safeguard the safety of party and government organs and key departments, and protect the safety of people's lives and property. Comrades, the Party and the government trust us, and the people are expecting us. Our responsibility is glorious and sacred. The Ministry of Public Security believes that all police officers and armed police forces will certainly be able to achieve new merits for the Party and the people in this struggle concerning the fate of the country.
