The Intersection of Day and Night

    Zhang Han

    I can't help but think of a world that is either black and white or not clearly defined.
    I can't help but think of a world where day and night are both separate and intertwined.
    Apart from white, all colors combined become black.
    Apart from black, no color can make white radiant.
    Black is incredibly rich, like the night that nurtures all things and moistens all things.
    Reverent and fragrant, silent yet magnificent, restrained yet reliable, oh night!
    White is incredibly sincere, like the day that reveals all and pours out all.
    Passionate yet dignified, charming yet holy, true yet moldable, oh day!
    The contrast of black and white, the chase of day and night, that flickering, vibrant scene, is the ultimate beauty in the world.
    Dawn and dusk, these most splendid, most tragic, and most stirring moments, are born at the intersection of day and night.
    Look at dusk, the fish return to the depths, the fishermen stop rowing, the smoke calls the children, and the travelers hurry on... In the wondrous changes at the edge of the sky, you can hear the soft sound of the setting sun kissing the earth; the tired birds returning to the woods are like the poet's burned manuscripts, carrying the passionate flames of the setting sun.
    —Night is the destination of the day. It is dusk that covers the earth's eyes with a veil of thought…

    Look at dawn, everything becomes lively, three-dimensional, clear, and intense, yet it does not escape its origin. The morning glow connects with the remnants of the previous night's light, and the morning sun is the sunset of last evening. The life and death of humanity, the love and separation of lovers, the rise and fall of worldly affairs, are like this celestial map, tirelessly speaking of impermanence and also of eternity.
    —Day is the hope of the night. It is dawn that raises the eyes of revival over the resplendent horizon once again…

    How can one not love this world that is either black and white or not clearly defined!
    How can one not love this world where day and night are both separate and intertwined!

### 昼夜之交

　　昼夜之交
    章翰
    不由想起黑白分明或不分明的世界。
    不由想起昼与夜若离又若即的世界。
    除了白色，所有颜色调在一起便成黑色。
    除了黑色，任何颜色都无法使白色灿烂。
    黑色是无比富有的，就如蕴藏万物滋润万物的夜晚。
    肃穆而宁馨、沉寂而豪壮、含蓄而可靠的夜呀！
    白色是无比坦诚的，就如昭示一切挥洒一切的白昼。
    热烈而庄重、多娇而圣洁、真实而可塑的昼呀！
    黑白之相衬，昼夜之相逐，那明明灭灭、如火如荼的景观，是天地间美之极至。
    黎明和黄昏，这最辉煌、最悲壮、最易激动人心的时刻，正诞生在昼夜之交。
    且看那黄昏，池鱼归渊，渔人罢棹，炊烟唤子，客旅兼程……于天末的奇丽变幻中，你可以听见夕阳吻地的轻响；那投林的倦鸟，也便如诗人焚烧的手稿，载着落日的殷殷血焰。
    ——黑夜是白天的归宿。是黄昏，把幽思的手捂在大地的眼睛上了……
    再看那黎明，一切都走向灵动，走向立体，走向明朗和白热，却走不出渊源。早霞连着夜前的残照，晓日便是昨晚的夕阳。人类的生生息息，爱情的朝朝暮暮，世事的消消长长，恰似这天图地象，不倦地说着无定，也说着永恒。
    ——白天是黑夜的希望。是黎明，把复苏的眼睛重新举过灿烂的地平线了……
    能不爱这黑白分明或不分明的世界！
    能不爱这昼与夜若离又若即的世界！
