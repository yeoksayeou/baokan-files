A farmer visited his son in the army and saw his son "personally" washing clothes. The farmer then went out and bought a "Simpson" fully automatic washing machine and hired a car to bring it to the company, telling his son not to be so "stupid" in the future. The company commander was at a loss for words. With over 100 people in the company, if every parent bought a washing machine, where would they put them all! Another mother didn't buy a washing machine, but she bought her son 50 shirts and 50 pairs of underwear in one go, telling him to wear one and throw it away when it got dirty, "throw them all away, and Mom will buy more."

Another phenomenon is that many parents send money with their sons when they enlist. One young man, when he enlisted, his mother gave him 7,000 yuan, saying, "You'll need money everywhere you go. If 7,000 yuan isn't enough, just write a letter!" A certain regiment statistics showed that in 1988, except for a few from impoverished areas, 98% of the new recruits brought money with them, with the most bringing 8,000 yuan. A certain new recruits training camp statistics showed that out of 350 new recruits, they brought a total of 21,000 yuan.

Remittance slips and parcel slips flying into the barracks are also problems that the army often encounters. A certain artillery regiment statistics showed that from January to June 1988, the average new soldier received 3 remittance slips and parcel slips. A certain regiment's mailroom log recorded that on March 18, 1988, 74 remittance slips were received, totaling 9,620 yuan.

The soldiers' rations are not lower than the average family's standard, and they don't have to pay for housing, clothing, electricity, or medical care. Each person also has more than 10 yuan in allowances per month. Why do the soldiers' parents still send so much money?

Firstly, it's spoiling. One mother said, "When my son was in kindergarten, I gave him 5 yuan a month, in primary school 10 yuan a month, in junior high 30 yuan a month, in senior high 50 yuan a month, and now in the army, can't I give him 100 yuan a month?" Last spring, before the Spring Festival, a soldier in a certain unit received 4,000 yuan in New Year's money from his grandmother in Shenzhen and a letter wishing the soldier "peace and prosperity every year, and wealth in every season." A soldier celebrating his 19th birthday spent 3,500 yuan; a certain unit had 40 "birthday stars" celebrating their birthdays in May 1988, spending a total of more than 20,000 yuan.

Secondly, it's "aspiring higher." Some soldiers' parents view the army with worldly eyes. One father sent his son who was in the army more than 2,000 yuan, attaching a letter saying: "This is for your platoon leader, please ask him to 'take care of' you to join the party." In previous years around March, after the new recruits' education ended and before the allocation, parents sent more money and parcels to their children to get them good positions. One parent wrote a letter to his son asking: "If the leadership assigns you to learn to drive a car, will 3,000 yuan be enough?" The officers in the company had to spend a lot of energy to get rid of the new recruits' entanglements, educating them not to bring bad practices into the barracks.

According to a sample survey by a certain group army, 21% of the new recruits' money was used for learning or other proper purposes, while 79% was used for smoking, drinking, and dressing up. A certain unit's 4 new recruits companies with 450 new recruits brought in more than 80,000 yuan when they enlisted, but in less than a month, it was all spent. One soldier brought in 2,000 yuan when he enlisted, but after half a year of extravagant spending, he had nothing left.

The new recruits' reckless spending has impacted the glorious tradition of hard work and self-denial in our army, and it is also not conducive to their growth. This point, their parents have not yet realized. One soldier brought in 8,000 yuan when he enlisted, and the company's cadres were surprised, but he just smiled and said, "It's nothing." The political instructor educated this soldier to maintain a frugal and simple style, advising him to deposit the money in the bank. That soldier laughed heartily, "What era is this? Still talking about those outdated issues. My family has more than 200,000 yuan in assets, and my parents let me spend it however I want!" One new recruit was on duty at 2 a.m., and he poked the soldier sleeping next to him, saying, "You go stand for me for two hours, and I'll give you 4 yuan!" The other soldier said, "Go away, who would do it for 4 yuan? Double it." "Okay, 8 yuan!" Both were criticized by the company commander for this.

### 战士能保持艰苦奋斗作风吗？

　　战士能保持艰苦奋斗作风吗？
    本报记者  罗同松
    有个农民到部队看望儿子，见儿子“亲自”洗衣服，于是上街买了台“辛普森”全自动洗衣机，雇汽车拉到连队，叫儿子往后别那么“傻干”。连长哭笑不得。全连１００多号人，要是父母都给买台洗衣机，往哪儿搁呀！有个大妈倒是没买洗衣机，她一次给儿子买了５０件汗衫，５０条裤衩，教儿子穿脏一件扔一件，“扔完了妈再给买”。
    还有一种现象是不少父母让儿子“带款入伍”。有个青年入伍时，母亲塞给他７０００元，说：“出门在外，到处要花销。７０００元不够，只管来信！”有个师统计，１９８８年的新兵，除个别贫困地区的外，９８％的人带款入伍，最多的８０００元。有个新兵教导营统计，３５０名新兵，共带款２．１万元。
    汇款单、包裹单飞进军营，也是部队时常碰到的问题。某炮团统计，１９８８年１月至６月，全团新战士平均每人收汇款单、包裹单３张。有个团的收发室登记簿记载，１９８８年３月１８日这天收到汇款单７４张，共计９６２０元。
    战士们的伙食，并不低于中等家庭水平，而且住房、穿衣、用电、看病等用不着花钱，每人每月还有１０多元津贴费，战士们的家长为什么还要大量寄钱呢？
    一是娇惯。有位母亲说：“儿子上幼儿园每月给５元，上小学每月１０元，上初中每月３０元，上高中每月５０元，如今上部队，还能不每月１００元？”去年春节前夕，某部一位战士收到在深圳的外祖母汇来的４０００元压岁钱和一封信，外祖母在信中祝这位战士“岁岁平安，四季发财”。有位战士过１９岁“大寿”，竟花了３５００元；某部１９８８年５月有４０名“小寿星”庆寿，共花２万多元。
    二是“高攀”。一些战士的家长用世俗的眼光看部队。有位父亲给当兵的儿子寄来２０００多元，附信说：这是给你指导员的，请他“照顾”你入党。往年３月，新兵入伍教育结束，临近分配，家长们为使子女分个好岗位，给子女汇款、寄包裹更多。有位家长写信向儿子征询：领导上如果分配你学开汽车，我送３０００元够不够？连队的军官要花费许多精力去摆脱新兵的纠缠，教育他们不要把不正之风带进军营。
    据某集团军抽样调查，新兵手里的钱，２１％用于学习或其他正当途径，７９％用于抽烟喝酒、讲穿戴。某部去年４个新兵连４５０名新兵，入伍时带款８万多元，不到一个月便花得精光。有个战士入伍时带款２０００元，只因大吃大喝半年便分文无存。
    新战士们如此挥金如土，给我军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统带来了冲击，同时也不利于他们的成长。这一点，他们的家长尚未意识到。有个战士入伍时带款８０００元，连队干部为之惊讶，他却笑笑说：“小意思”。指导员教育这个战士保持艰苦朴素作风，劝他把钱存入银行。那战士哈哈大笑：“什么年代了，还讲那些老掉牙的问题。我家里有２０多万元财产，爸爸妈妈让我爱怎么花就怎么花！”有个新战士轮到凌晨２时站岗，他捅捅睡在旁边的战友说：“你去给我站两个钟头，我给你４元钱！”那战友说：“去你的，４元钱谁干？加一倍吧。”“好，８元！”为此，两人都受到连首长批评。
