Canadian House of Commons Speaker Fraser Hosts Banquet for Wan Li
Wan Li Hopes for Long-Term Stable Sino-Canadian Friendship

According to Xinhua News Agency, Vancouver, May 13 (Reporter Xu Linxing) Chairman Wan Li tonight at the welcoming banquet held by Canadian House of Commons Speaker John Fraser expressed the hope that both sides would work together to "promote long-term stable friendly cooperative relations between China and Canada."

Wan Li said in his speech that the relationship between China and Canada is very friendly. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1970, the two countries have continuously developed ties in politics, economy, culture, education, and other fields. He hoped that his visit would help to further strengthen and develop friendly cooperation between China and Canada.

After commenting on the beautiful scenery, modern construction, and high standard of living in Vancouver, Wan Li said, "Compared to Canada, China is still underdeveloped, and China has a long way to go. However, 'since the Canadian people have been able to turn the then barren land of the west coast into a prosperous and economically developed region in over 100 years, I believe that the Chinese people will also be able to turn their own Pacific coast into an economically developed region in a relatively short period of time.'"

Wan Li continued, "At that time, economic ties and personnel exchanges across the Pacific will see unprecedented development." He also emphasized that to achieve this great cause, both China and Canada have a lot to do.

Fraser, who specially came from the Canadian capital Ottawa to Vancouver, said in his speech at the banquet that over the years, the two countries have gained a good mutual understanding through cultural and diplomatic exchanges; friendly relations between the two sides have been strengthened; China has become Canada's second-largest export market in Asia, and the prospect of further expanding bilateral trade continues to be explored.

He also said, "As we move towards the 1990s, we are confident that Canada and China will continue to maintain mutually beneficial relations."

　　加拿大联邦众院议长弗雷泽欢宴万里    
    万里希望中加友好长期稳定
    据新华社温哥华５月１３日电（记者徐林兴）万里委员长今晚在加拿大联邦众议院议长约翰·弗雷泽为他举行的欢迎宴会上表示，希望双方共同努力“促进中加之间长期稳定的友好合作关系”。
    万里在讲话中说，中国和加拿大的关系非常友好。自１９７０年建交以来，两国在政治、经济、文化、教育等各个方面的联系不断发展。他希望他的这次访问能有助于进一步加强和发展中加之间的友好合作。
    万里在谈到温哥华的美丽风景、现代化建设和人民的生活水平给他留下了深刻印象后说，同加拿大相比，中国还很不发达，中国要走的路还很长，但是，“既然加拿大人能在１００多年的时间内把当时仍然是一片荒芜土地的西海岸建设成为繁荣昌盛的经济发达地区，我相信中国人也一定能在不太长的时间里把自己的太平洋沿岸建设成为经济发达地区”。
    万里接着说，“到那时，太平洋两岸的经济联系和人员来往将会出现今天难以想象的大发展。”他还强调，为实现这一伟大的事业，中加双方都有很多事情可做。
    专程从加首都渥太华前来温哥华的弗雷泽议长在宴会讲话中说，多年来，加中两国通过文化和外交来往已经获得了良好的相互了解；双方的友好关系已经得到加强；中国已经成为加拿大在亚洲的第二大出口市场，而且进一步扩大双边贸易的前景仍在继续开拓。
    他还说，当我们走向９０年代的时候，我们确信加中两国将会继续保持互惠的关系。
