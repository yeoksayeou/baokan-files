Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 19th.

Two South Korean warships invaded the northern waters off the western coast of Mount Kumgang today, engaging in military provocation.

The report stated that the provocative actions by the South Korean side are entirely artificial attempts to escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

The report warned the South Korean side that if similar incidents occur again, it will bear all the consequences.

A South Korean warship intruded into the northern waters at the same location on the 18th.
