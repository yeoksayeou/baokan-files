People's psychology is hard to fathom these days. Take consumption, for example. Those who don't smoke are seen puffing on "Marlboro," those with modest incomes are dressed in silk and gold, young people spend thousands without batting an eye, and placing a color TV and refrigerator in a humble room is nothing unusual. However, in consumption, this mentality of "if you have it, I want it too" and "if you can spend it, I can too" has led to various forms of abnormal consumption.

In Yancheng, a city in Jiangsu province, three hundred million yuan is spent on cigarettes annually. I have a peasant friend from the countryside who has become quite wealthy in recent years. His living conditions, transportation, and even the cigarettes he smokes have all improved significantly. He now smokes "Marlboro" instead of rolling his own. He candidly admits, "I can't tell the difference in taste. It's just that everyone else smokes high-end brands, so it's about the brand."

Participating in consumption at the same level has become the goal, and flaunting wealth is the interest. This mindset is quite common. From the flow of smokers, it can be seen that cigarettes are becoming increasingly high-end nationwide, smokers are getting younger, and the expenditure is increasing. According to a survey in Yancheng, Jiangsu, each household spends about 5% of their food budget on cigarettes. Annually, the city's residents spend 306 million yuan on cigarettes, equivalent to building two power plants in Yancheng.

Spending money to the point of satisfaction

A few young people were dining at a restaurant, and the waitress brought out two bottles of "Erguotou" (a type of Chinese liquor).

"Who wants that stuff? Change it to 'Maotai,'" the young man complained, "You're deliberately making me lose face in front of my friends! I spend money to the point of satisfaction, and then I'll give you a commendation flag."

Someone conducted a sample survey, and it was found that last year, the per capita expenditure on alcohol in Heilongjiang Province increased by nearly onefold compared to previous years. Even some low-income households are unwilling to fall behind.

　　求同心理与畸形消费
    路益绶
    如今，人们的心理很难捉摸。就拿消费来说，不会抽烟的叼着“万宝路”，收入不多的穿绸戴金，年轻人“一掷千金”不皱眉，陋室摆彩电、冰箱更是不足为怪。可是，在消费中，这种“你有我也要有”、“你会花我也会花”的攀比和求同心理，已引发出种种畸形消费。
  盐城一年抽烟花掉三个亿
    我有个农村老乡，近年来阔得不认识。住的、用的、骑的，今非昔比外，抽的烟也由自卷烟变成了“万宝路”。他坦率地说：“也抽不出好坏。不过人家都抽高级的，讲牌子。”
    参加同一水平上的消费成为目的，比阔就是兴趣。这种心态大有人在。从抽烟的人流看，各地抽的烟普遍越来越高级，抽烟的人越来越年轻，费用越来越大。据江苏盐城市调查，每户抽烟开支占食品消费的百分之五，一年全市居民抽烟花费三点零六亿元，相当于建两个盐城发电厂。
    花钱到了数才满意
    有几位青年人在一家饭店吃喝，服务小姐摆上两瓶“二锅头”。
    “谁要那东西，换上‘茅台’”，青年不满地吵起来，“你们是成心让我在朋友面前丢份！我花钱到了数就给你们店送表扬锦旗。”
    有人作过抽样调查，光买酒去年黑龙江省人均花费比前几年增长近一倍。有些低收入户也不甘落后。
