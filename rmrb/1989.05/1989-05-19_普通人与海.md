Title: Ordinary People and the Sea

Grandpa said: Behind the house, there used to be a sea.

Facing the vast expanse of land behind the house, which is now salty and alkaline, I can hardly imagine what it looked like when it was the sea. Yet, I have dreamt about the sea and often stand by the edge of this dried-up sea, mimicking Grandpa's mannerisms and tone to tell others about the sea, as if recounting an ancient legend.

Perhaps because the sea is gone, people here have lost their spirit. Everyone born here is quite ugly. When I was born, my hair was yellow and fuzzy, like down.

Grandma always brings up the story of how my father wanted to abandon me. Even when I grew up, she still mentioned it. Maybe she wants me to always remember that she saved me from being discarded and raised me with great effort for over 20 years. About this matter, I never verified it with my father. First, I was afraid of his authority, and second, I didn't want to make him feel awkward. So, I lived in confusion for over 20 years. Actually, I no longer care whether I was truly going to be abandoned or by whom. The reason I sometimes think about it and can even laugh calmly and appreciatively is that I later realized—people are all born in a state of confusion, not knowing who expects them or who dislikes them. Whether they are accepted with tolerance or expelled is purely a matter of luck, especially for ordinary people, for those ordinary infants who have not had the fortune to ride on clouds.

I am easily jealous of others—this is my greatest flaw. As a child, I envied my younger brother because he could be accepted without any consideration right from birth. His seemingly innate nature of being content with everything made him quite favored by our parents during his growing years. While my arrogance and disobedience made my attempts at pleasing them clumsy and hurried, he only needed to maintain his usual docility. As I grew older, the number of people I envied increased. Because many people can remain silent and steadfastly guard something. They recognize and appreciate each other for this, while I, wherever I go, am like a stranger. No one knows better than I do that everything they rely on is because when they, like my younger brother, crouched in the corner basking in the sun, they never thought of anything, not even the sea. How can people live without comparing and associating?—since they are human!

But they still live without analyzing, summarizing, or reflecting, and use their way of living to suffocate all those who are as wild as I am.

Oh, they clearly know that among all forms of death, I fear suffocation the most.

...

Since I was not exiled, do I have the right to invite all those who, like me, yearn for the sea to dream about the sea?

When will it be, and when will the vast sea reappear behind our house?

　　普通人与海
    三羊
    爷爷说：屋后，原本是有一片海的。
    对着屋后一大片泛着盐碱的土地，我怎么也想象不出这里是海时的情景。可我居然还做过关于海的梦，并常常在这干涸了的海的边上，学着爷爷的神态与腔调对人讲起海，像是在讲一个古老的传说。
    也许是因为没有了海，人也就失去了灵气的缘故，我们这里出生的人都很难看。我出生的时候，头发黄茸茸的好似汗毛。
    奶奶总是提起父亲要把我扔掉的事，即使我长得很大了，她也总提。大概是为了让我永远记住，是她把我从行将被抛弃的境遇中抱了回来，辛辛苦苦地养活了我２０多年。关于这事，我从来没去向父亲核实，一来畏于他的威严，二来怕他尴尬，于是便糊里糊涂地活了二十多年。其实，我早已不在乎自己最初是不是果真要被扔掉，要被谁扔掉。之所以有时还会想起来，甚至在想起来的时候还能平静地、欣赏似地干笑两声，那是因为我后来意识到了——人都是在不知被谁期待、被谁讨厌的懵懂中朝这个世界走来的，他是被宽容地收留，还是被驱逐，原本都是很侥幸的事，尤其是对于普通人，对于那些无幸踩驾祥云的普通婴孩来说。
    我很容易嫉恨别人——这是我为人最大的丑陋。小时候嫉恨弟弟，因为他能一出生便不经考虑就被收留，他的那种似乎是与生俱来的安于一切的秉性又使他在成长的岁月里颇得父母青睐。在我的张狂和不恭顺使得我的讨好变得十分性急与笨拙的时候，他却只需保持他那固有的安分便够了。长大以后，我嫉恨的人就更多。因为许多人总能一样地缄默，一样地顽强固守某样东西。他们凭此彼此认同，相互欣赏，而我无论走到哪里都像个异族。没有人能比我更清楚，他们凭借的一切都是因为当他们和弟弟一样趷蹴在墙角里晒太阳时，从来就不会联想什么，甚至不会想起海。人怎么可以不比较，不联想地生活呢？——既然是个人！
    可他们仍是不分析，不归纳，不总结地活着，并以自己的活着来窒息一切如我一样张狂的异族们。
    哦，他们分明知道在所有的死亡之中我最惧怕的便是窒息。
    ……
    既然我没有被放逐，那么我是否有权利邀请所有同我一样渴望着海的人都来做做关于海的梦？
    什么时候，要到什么时候，我们的屋后又会出现一片浩淼的大海？
