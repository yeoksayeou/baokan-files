Title: New Bridge

The season has changed, and there is not a trace of autumn left. Winter arrived so suddenly that I was caught unprepared, still wearing my autumn clothes. The pedestrians on the street have already donned various winter outfits, moving in harmony with the cold season. But I am walking alone in the winter snow, enduring the harsh lashes of the wind and snow, suffering more than just physical discomfort.

I encountered her by the small bridge. I don't know who she was waiting for. Our eyes met for a moment, just as a cold wind blew, blinding us both with sand. As we rubbed our eyes, the fleeting spark of our encounter was extinguished. Our hearts froze to zero degrees. After a moment of silence, we each walked away.

Carrying a heavy sense of oppression, I wandered blindly through the winding paths. The trees along the way were bare, exposing their lonely souls. They no longer needed to hide anything. A few small birds flitted among the branches, searching for something, yet not really searching. They once had warm nests that could nurture dreams and sing sweet songs. Now, their warm nests are gone. They can only hop from branch to branch, accompanying the bare trees.

In front of two sea buckthorn trees, I stopped. Though the two trees stood side by side, they no longer clung to each other as they once did. The leaves were gone, and the bare branches were withered and cracked by the cold wind. Stripped of their summer and autumn greenery, they revealed their wounds to the world. A few sea buckthorn fruits still clung to the branches, remnants of the golden autumn. But they were few and far between, and even those few were beginning to rot from the outside in. Most of the golden, shiny sea buckthorn fruits had been picked by playful children. When the fruits were picked, the trees seemed to feel both pain and joy. After all, the fruits they bore over the long summer and autumn were meant to be given to the children. If no one came to pick them, wouldn't they end up rotting on the ground? They cherished the green season and the golden season, but both had passed. I stood before the two sea buckthorn trees, my thoughts troubled and melancholy. As I approached, I suddenly noticed a small, fresh leaf sprouting on the left tree. It braved the biting cold and the snow, painting a spring hue in the icy world. My heart sprouted a tender bud, and the frozen stream began to flow again.

On my way back, I passed the small bridge and saw her again. Though she still wore her white down jacket and her eyes sparkled with youth, I felt as if I didn't recognize her. She seemed so strange. She was no longer the same person. In this frozen season, she had experienced a sense of life and discovered a philosophy of living, shattering her old self from within. She had awakened. But I was still in a drowsy state, perhaps I too would awaken. Would it be now or tomorrow?

I walked slowly towards her. "Who are you waiting for?" "You." We didn't say another word. Then, we walked side by side towards the new bridge that awaited us, its outline already visible in the distance.

And the small bridge remained far behind us…

　　新桥
    丁月
    转换了的季节，已没有一丝秋色了。冬天来得这么突然，使我毫无足够的准备，还身着那套秋天的衣服。街上的行人早已穿起了各色各样的冬装，和隆冬并行旋转着。而我却在冬雪中独自行走，忍受着风雪的暴戾鞭挞，何止只是肌肤之苦呢？
    我与她在小桥畔不期而遇。不知道她在等谁。目光相触的一刹那，正巧一阵朔风吹来，我们都被沙子迷了眼睛。各自揉眼的同时，一瞬间的相触之火熄灭了。心温都降到了零度。沉默了片刻，我们各自走开了。
    怀着一种沉重的压迫感，我穿过曲曲弯弯的小径，盲目地行走着。路旁各种树木已一叶不存，赤裸裸地坦露着孤独的灵魂。这时，它们不需要遮掩什么了。有零星的几只小雀展开灰色的翅膀，在树杈上跳来跳去，像是在寻找什么，又不像在寻找什么。它们原来有温暖的巢穴，巢穴是可以孕育一个一个幻梦，可以唱出一支又一支小曲。而今温暖的巢没有了。它们只能在枝上跳来跳去，伴着这赤裸的树木。
    在两株海棠树前，我停住了脚步。两株海棠虽然并肩而立，但它们已不像往日那样相互依恋了。枝上的叶子荡然无存，光秃秃的枝干被寒风吹得枯瘦皲裂，一脱秋夏的绿衫，让人们观看身上的累累伤痕。在细枝上，偶尔也有几枝海棠果残留了下来。那是金秋时结出的果实，只是已经寥寥，更何况仅有的几枚也有些变色，从外向里开始腐烂了。大部分金白光艳的海棠果早已被淘气的孩子偷去。在偷摘的时候，海棠树显示出了一种痛苦而又欣喜的心情。因为在漫长的夏秋季节，所结出的果实是应该赐给孩子们的。如果无人来摘，岂不要葬身在脚下吗！它们留恋着绿色的季节，也留恋着金色的季节，但毕竟都已经过去了。我怅然面对两株海棠，心绪烦乱而凄凉。一步步走近海棠树，我蓦然发现左边的那株树上，有一片小而鲜的叶子正跃然冒出。它不惧寒风之凛冽，不怕霜雪之击打，把春的颜色深深地涂在了冰天雪地中。我的心萌发了一枚嫩芽，凝固了的小溪开始流淌了。
    返回的路上经过那座小桥时，又发现了她。尽管她还是穿着往日的白羽绒服，闪动着那双永远年轻的眼睛，但是我似乎不认识她了。显得那样的陌生。她已经不再是她了。她在这冰封的季节，领略到了一种生命的体验，同时也发现了一种生活的哲理，从内心深层粉碎了自我。她醒了。而我却还在睡意朦胧中，可能我也会醒来的。是即刻还是明天？
    我向她缓步走去。“你在等谁？”“等你。”我们没有再说一句话。于是，并排朝前走去，前面有一座新桥在等我们，并且已经隐约看见了那座新桥的轮廓。
    而那座小桥远远地留在了我们的身后……
