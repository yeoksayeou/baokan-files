    Yugoslav Federal Presidency Chairman Dejan Šorlić today met with visiting Polish United Workers' Party Politburo member and Prime Minister Mieczysław Rakowski. The two sides exchanged views on political, economic, and reform situations in their respective countries. Šorlić Chairman said that Yugoslavia, like Poland, has no other way out of its difficulties except to resolutely turn towards a market economy, further open up to the world market, and more actively participate in the current process of European integration. At the same time, he pointed out that the huge foreign debt burdens of both countries have hindered economic development. The foreign debt issue should be quickly resolved through fruitful dialogue and cooperation with creditor countries and international financial institutions.

    Prime Minister Rakowski arrived in Yugoslavia on May 24 for a visit. During his talks with Yugoslav Prime Minister Branko Mikulić, Federal Presidency Chairman Dejan Šorlić, and League of Communists of Yugoslavia Central Committee Chairman Slobodan Milošević, Rakowski said that Poland and Yugoslavia face similar economic problems: heavy foreign debt, low economic growth rates, and lack of efficiency. The Polish government is making efforts for national stability, and reform is unavoidable. Institutional reforms in Poland must ensure the firm implementation of national reconciliation, political pluralism, and further development of socialist democracy. This is the clear and unshakable direction of the Polish United Workers' Party.

    Both sides agreed that the reforms in some socialist countries indicate that socialism has entered a new stage of development, with many issues that need to be addressed. For this reason, socialist countries must better understand each other, exchange experiences, and engage in creative dialogue.

　　波兰南斯拉夫领导人认为
    改革是唯一出路
    本报贝尔格莱德５月２５日电  记者严正报道：南联邦主席团主席德尔诺夫舍克今天会见正在这里访问的波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、总理拉科夫斯基双方交流了两国的政治、经济及改革的情况，德尔诺夫舍克主席说，南斯拉夫与波兰一样，摆脱困难的出路除了其它之外，要坚决地转向市场经济，进一步向世界市场开放，更加积极地参与目前欧洲一体化的进程。同时他还指出，两国的巨额外债负担阻缓了经济发展。外债问题应该通过与债权国以及国际金融机构富有成果的对话、合作迅速加以解决。
    拉科夫斯基总理于５月２４日抵达南斯拉夫访问，他与南总理马尔科维奇、南联邦主席团主席德尔诺夫舍克、南共联盟中央主席团主席潘切夫斯基会谈时说，波兰与南斯拉夫面临着类似的经济问题：沉重的外债、经济的低增长率和缺乏效益。波兰政府正在为国家稳定作出努力，改革是无可抉择的。在波兰进行的机构改革必须确保坚定地实行民族谅解、政治多元和进一步发展社会主义民主的方针。这是波兰统一工人党毫不动摇的明确方向。
    双方一致认为，某些社会主义国家的改革，表明社会主义进入了发展新阶段，其中有许多问题需要作出回答。为此，社会主义国家必须更好地相互了解，交流经验，进行创造性的对话。
