The county land administration bureau revealed: From 1982 to 1988, the county investigated and handled a total of 4,853 cases of illegal land occupation for housing construction, covering 1,912.82 acres. In 1983, the entire village of Zhucheng in Chengjiao Township had a population of 915 people and 1,330 acres of paddy fields, with an average of 1.45 acres per person. By 1988, the village's population had risen to 1,078, but the arable land area had shrunk to 1,043 acres, with an average of only 0.96 acres per person.

Farmers are deeply resentful of the chaotic occupation and misuse of farmland for housing. Some villagers have collectively filed complaints to the county land administration bureau. However, the officials of the county land administration bureau, although armed with the Land Law, are unable to handle some cases of illegal land occupation for housing construction, and they are even more hesitant when it comes to cases involving certain county leaders' illegal housing construction.

Our country is an agricultural nation, and farmland is the foundation on which farmers depend for their livelihood. Farmers in our county are calling out: Save our lifeline—farmland!

### 占耕地建房农民何处谋生

　　占耕地建房农民何处谋生
    我县国土局披露：１９８２年至１９８８年，全县共查处各种违法占用耕地建房案件４８５３起，占地１９１２．８２亩。城郊乡竹桥村１９８３年全村人口９１５人，有水田１３３０亩，人均为１．４５亩。到１９８８年，全村人口上升为１０７８人，耕地面积却只有１０４３亩，人均只剩０．９６亩。
    农民对乱占滥用田地建房深恶痛绝。一些乡村的农民曾集体上告到县国土局。可是，县国土局的同志虽手持土地法，却对一些违法占地建房的案件查处不了，特别是触及到某些县领导干部违章建房的案子更是望而却步。
    我国是个农业国，耕地是农民赖以生存的根基。我乡农民呼吁：救救我们的衣食父母——耕地吧！
