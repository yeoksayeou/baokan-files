Recently, our bank conducted spot checks on 7 savings offices and discovered that 20 instances of public funds being transferred to personal savings accounts, totaling 610,000 yuan. For example, a certain unit transferred over 840,000 yuan of public funds into a personal savings account under an individual's name starting from February 1988, lasting for 9 months, with over 25,000 yuan in interest going to the individual. In December 1988, the business department of a certain company deposited nearly 60,000 yuan of public funds into a savings account under a personal name.

The "public funds transfer to savings" phenomenon not only encourages improper practices among certain units and individuals, leading administrative organs to misjudge the public's purchasing power, but also creates obstacles for the country's macroeconomic decision-making. Therefore, this issue must be given serious attention. To address this problem, we believe the following measures can be taken:

Establish an authoritative financial inspection and audit institution. Currently, the People's Bank of China faces numerous difficulties in handling cases of public funds being transferred to savings accounts. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the status of the central bank while seeking support from local governments and collaborating with relevant departments to establish an authoritative financial inspection and audit institution.

Implement comprehensive management and differentiated treatment. For enterprises with substantial funds, actively guide them to adopt specialized account management; for enterprises with poor economic performance, focus on combining credit tightening and the recovery of overdue loans with the enterprise's inventory clearance and the exploration of existing fund potential; for the minority who repeatedly violate regulations and seek personal gain, impose necessary economic sanctions or even legal penalties.

Strengthen the education of bank staff on financial policies and regulations, enhance their awareness of policy implementation, and gradually improve the savings contract management responsibility system. Savings contracts should not only complete the savings tasks but also ensure that the sources of savings are reasonable and legal.

The issuance of savings targets must be pragmatic and based on actual conditions. Different regions, economic foundations, years, and social backgrounds must be comprehensively considered.

### “公款转储”现象透视

　　“公款转储”现象透视
    最近，我行抽查了７个储蓄所，发现一些单位的公款转作私人储蓄的有２０笔，共计６１万元。例如，某单位自１９８８年２月以来，以个人名义将单位的８４万多元公款，转作私人存款，时间长达９个月，２５００多元利息归个人所得。某公司经营部于１９８８年１２月把近６万元公款以私人名义存入银行储蓄所。
    “公款转储”不仅助长了一些单位和个人的不正之风，使领导机关错误地估计群众的购买力，而且还给国家的宏观决策设置了障碍。因此，必须引起高度重视。要解决这一问题，我们认为可以采取以下措施：
    建立有权威的金融检查、稽核机构。目前，人民银行查处公款转储的困难重重。因此，有必要在提高中央银行地位的同时，力求征得地方政府的支持，配合有关部门成立有权威的金融检查、稽核机构。
    实行综合治理，区别对待。对资金较多的企业要积极加以疏导，实行专户管理；对经济效益较差的企业要注重将紧缩信贷、收回到期逾期贷款的工作和企业的清仓查库、挖掘现有资金潜力结合起来；对那些屡教不改，从中牟取私利的少数人，实行必要的经济制裁乃至法律制裁。
    加强对银行干部的金融政策、法规教育，提高他们执行政策的自觉性，逐步完善储蓄承包经营责任制。储蓄承包不仅要完成承包的储蓄任务，而且也要使储蓄来源合理合法。
    下达储蓄指标一定要实事求是，务必从实际出发，不能主观行事。要从不同地区、不同经济基础、不同年景和不同的社会背景等因素来综合考虑。
