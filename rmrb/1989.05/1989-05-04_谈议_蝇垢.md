Those major cases that cannot be left unaddressed lest they provoke public outrage and jeopardize social stability and socialist construction are the "tigers" and must be attacked from all sides. Those general practices of seeking favors and writing notes, which do not constitute major cases and are not considered "tigers," should they be ignored?

No.

Some people say, "I only seek favors and write notes to buy a good cigarette. At most, it's just a bit of fly dirt. What's the big deal!" Those who say this do not realize the serious social impact: your relatives, friends, neighbors, and those related and informed within and outside the circle, will imitate and follow suit, spreading from one point to the entire surface, thus forming a trend. The peak of this trend is the erroneous mindset that even good cigarettes and alcohol are not considered good, beautiful, or virtuous unless obtained through favors. In this atmosphere, favors expand and notes upgrade: from buying good cigarettes and alcohol to seeking medical treatment, job transfers, promotions, military enlistment, exceeding birth quotas, and purchasing steel... Thus, in every household and alley, the saying goes: "Nothing gets done without pulling strings!" This is how small things become big.

Upon closer examination, "fly dirt" may seem small, but it can grow from seeking minor gains to abusing power and breaking the law. If tigers are not completely eliminated, flies can turn into tigers, and the tiger problem becomes even more severe! Although "flies" are small, they can create corruption and demoralize the people. Both fly problems and tiger problems must be eradicated.

Seeking favors and writing notes means "unfairness." From the start, it challenges the Party's revolutionary tradition, the superiority of socialism, and the spiritual civilization of the Chinese nation. It is difficult for an ant to shake a tree! "Those who consider the world, often plan for difficulties and neglect the easy, prepare for the feared and ignore the unquestioned. However, disasters often arise from what is neglected, and chaos often starts from what is not doubted." The lessons of the ancients and our own lessons, though different in nature, cannot be compared. However, we can find similarities and be enlightened.

Neglecting improper practices can be said to be related to the long-term lack of ideological education and the lack of effective measures to combat improper practices. Although the manifestations of improper practices are insignificant, when combined, the impact is quite serious. Therefore, from recognizing to practicing, from the past to the present, it is indeed necessary to seriously address the "fly phenomenon."

Neglecting improper practices will inevitably cause significant harm to our modernization efforts. It is said to be significant because it poisons the reform environment and hinders reform. We have already regarded certain improper practices as corrupt phenomena. This is not a matter of terminology but a matter of heightened awareness. Given this shift in awareness, it is imperative to correct improper practices as a systematic project and place it on the agenda without any further delay.

### 谈议“蝇垢”

　　谈议“蝇垢”
    岳楠
    那些不办不足以平民愤，不办便危及安定团结和社会主义建设的大案要案，堪称“老虎”，自应上上下下群起而攻。那些一般的开后门、递条子之类的不正之风，构不成大案要案，算不上什么“老虎”，但是，是否就不必认真对待了呢？
    否。
    有人说，“我开后门递条子只不过买条好烟。大不了是星点儿蝇垢，有什么了不起！”说这话的人不知道严重的社会效应是：你的亲戚朋友，你的左邻右舍以及相关而知情者们，圈子里外，攀比效法，由点及面，遂成风气。此风至盛的标志是，业已造成那种即便是好烟好酒，非后门而不以为好、不以为美、不以为善的错误心态。在这种风气中，后门扩大条子升级：从买好烟好酒到就医求药，到调动工作，到提干参军，到超计划生育，到套购钢材……于是居室井市，街头巷尾有口头禅流行：“不走后门办不成事！”可谓由小及大了。
    细察，“蝇垢”虽小，却可由谋图微利膨胀为弄权枉法。虎未尽除又有蝇之变虎，而虎患大焉！“苍蝇”虽小，却可制造腐败，涣散民心。蝇之患与虎之患看来皆在必除之列。
    开后门递条子意味着“不公”。它一开始就是对党的革命传统，对社会主义的优越性，对中华民族的精神文明的挑战。蚍蜉撼树谈何不易！“虑天下者，常图其难而忽其所易，备其可畏而遗其所不疑。然而，祸常发于所忽之中，而乱常起于不足疑之事”。古人的教训与我们的教训性质相异，不可同日而语，然而总可以异中见同，从中得到启发吧。
    对不正之风的疏忽，可以说与长期以来思想教育抓得不够，与不正之风作斗争的措施不够有力相关。不正之风的点滴表现虽不起眼，但汇总起来，影响却是相当厉害的。因此从认识到实践，从既往到当前，认真对待一下“苍蝇现象”确是十分必要的。
    对不正之风的疏忽，必然对我们的现代化事业带来不小的损害。谓其不小，缘为它在毒化改革的社会环境，滞殆改革。我们已经把某些不正之风视为腐败现象，这不是什么字眼儿问题，而是认识上的提高。鉴于这一认识上的转机，把纠正不正之风，作为一项系统工程，摆到日程上来，不应再有半点迟疑。
