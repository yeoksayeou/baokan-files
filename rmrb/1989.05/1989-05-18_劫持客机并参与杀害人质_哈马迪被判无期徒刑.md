    Convicted of Hijacking and Involvement in Murder of Hostages:
    Hamadi Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

    Our correspondent Jiang Jian Guo reports from Bonn, May 18: The court in Hesse, West Germany, announced yesterday that Muhammad Ali Hamadi, a Lebanese national, was sentenced to life imprisonment for hijacking a Pan Am aircraft and participating in the murder of an American hostage in June 1985.

    Hamadi, 25, was arrested in January 1987 at Frankfurt Airport for smuggling explosives. After 10 months of trial, the court confirmed Hamadi's guilt. Hamadi admitted to hijacking the plane but denied involvement in the murder. It is reported that Hamadi showed no reaction to yesterday's verdict and even yawned during the reading of the sentence.

    The parents of the murdered American hostage expressed satisfaction with the verdict yesterday but urged the U.S. government to supervise the execution of the sentence.

    After Hamadi's arrest, the Lebanese Hezbollah kidnapped two West German hostages, demanding that the West German government release him. The two hostages were released in September and December 1987. However, recently, another West German was briefly kidnapped in Lebanon, and after being released, was kidnapped again. It is believed that this is related to the verdict.

　　劫持客机并参与杀害人质    
    哈马迪被判无期徒刑
    本报波恩５月１８日电  记者江建国报道：西德黑森州法院昨天宣布，对１９８５年６月劫持泛美航空公司客机并参与杀害一名美国人质的黎巴嫩人穆罕默德·阿里·哈马迪判处无期徒刑。
    ２５岁的哈马迪是１９８７年１月在法兰克福机场因偷运炸药被捕的。法院经过１０个月的审讯，确认哈马迪罪名成立。哈马迪承认劫持飞机，但否认杀害人质。据报道，哈马迪对昨天的判决无动于衷，在宣读判决书过程中甚至打起了哈欠。
    被杀害的美国人质的父母昨天对判决表示满意，但他们呼吁美国政府监督判决的执行。
    哈马迪被捕后，黎巴嫩真主党先后绑架了两名西德人质，要挟西德政府。两人质已于１９８７年９月和１２月先后被释放。但最近又有西德人在黎巴嫩被短时间绑架，其中一人获释后又再次被绑架，据信与这次判决有关。
