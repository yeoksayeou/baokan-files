On April 12, the sixth edition of our newspaper published a letter from one of our reporters detailing an investigation into the exploitative practices of vendors near Beijing Zoo. After this report, more readers wrote in to share their experiences of being cheated. The letters published today, along with the reporter's ongoing coverage, indicate that the illegal activities of some melon vendors in this area are not isolated incidents. Some individuals continue to cheat and extort customers without remorse.

Fair trade and honesty are timeless principles of commerce. Setting up a stall to do business is, of course, about making money. However, relying on deception and even coercion to gain ill-gotten wealth, while it may bring in more money, will ultimately lead to the loss of one's conscience. If money is made in this way, it is truly regrettable!

The issue is not just about the public's sadness over a few merchants who make money at the expense of their conscience. In fact, consumers often encounter issues like short weights, substandard goods, and being cheated or overcharged in free markets or at stalls. Deceptive practices are spreading like a plague, injecting a negative influence into societal morals and severely damaging the reputation of individual vendors. In the capital city of Beijing, such disgraceful behavior undoubtedly tarnishes the image of this ancient and civilized city.

It seems that mere revocation of business licenses and fines of a few dozen yuan are insufficient to stop this trend. To curb this negative influence, relevant departments in Beijing must take decisive action to thoroughly address the issue.

　　整治“宰”人摊贩
    四月十二日，本报第六版刊登本报记者写的信访调查，披露北京动物园附近摊贩“宰”人的行径后，又有一些读者来信诉说他们被坑骗的经过。今天刊出的几封来信和记者连续报道说明，这一带有些卖瓜摊贩的不法售卖活动不是偶然的，有些人至今仍不思悔改，继续坑骗、敲诈顾客。
    买卖公平，老少无欺，从古至今是经商的基本准则和固有的道德。摆摊经商，无疑是要赚钱的，而靠坑骗，甚至以胁迫的手段攫取不义之财，虽然多捞了些钱，却会丢掉人的良知。如果钱“赚”到这般地步，实在可悲！
    问题还不在于人们对几个昧着良心赚钱的商贩表示悲叹。事实上，消费者在自由市场或摊点上，常常会碰到缺斤少两，以次充好等等被坑骗、被“宰”的事。坑骗行为像瘟疫一样开始蔓延，给社会风气中注入一股浊流，也使整个个体摊贩的声誉大受损害。在首都北京，这种不光彩的做法，无疑，给文明古都抹了黑。
    看来，对于不法商贩，仅仅靠吊销营业执照，几十元罚款的处罚已无济于事，要刹住这股歪风，还需北京市有关部门下决心全面、彻底地整治。
