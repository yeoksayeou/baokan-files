In many regions of North China, a significant increase in grain production is entirely possible. The key lies in changing mindsets and altering the long-standing tradition of favoring wheat over corn—North China can possibly achieve one ton of grain per mu.

**The North Can Possibly Achieve One Ton of Grain per Mu**

**Reporter: Jiang Jianke**

Wang Shu'an, born in July 1929, is a professor at the College of Agriculture, Beijing Agricultural University. He has long been engaged in the research and teaching of wheat cultivation theory and technology. He was formerly the dean of the College of Agriculture, vice-chairman of the Crop Cultivation Research Society of the Chinese Society of Crop Science, a wheat technology consultant for the Beijing Municipal Government, and vice-president of the Beijing Agricultural Society.

Reporter: Our population is increasing year by year, and water resources are becoming increasingly scarce. However, grain production has stagnated for several years. What do you think are the ways to increase grain production?

Wang Shu'an: This is precisely the subject of our research. From the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" to the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," during the participation in the Yellow-Huai-Hai scientific and technological breakthrough, we conducted research on the summer-autumn grain balanced high-yield cultivation system in Wutian Township, Wuqiao County, Hebei Province, with local cadres and agricultural technicians. We explored the technology of late wheat yielding 400 kilograms per mu and mid-late maturing corn yielding 550-600 kilograms per mu, finding a new way to achieve one ton of grain per mu annually.

Reporter: Could this be a "special remedy," or are the cultivation conditions particularly favorable?

Wang Shu'an: We did not use superior varieties or apply much high-quality fertilizer. The wheat variety used was the locally common "Lu Mai 8," and the corn variety was "Yi Dan 4." The traditional concept was that wheat must be sown by the autumnal equinox. To ensure sowing wheat, corn had to give way, using early-maturing varieties. Now we have broken through the ancestral habit of sowing wheat, changing from autumnal equinox wheat to late-sown wheat, delaying the wheat sowing period by 10 to 15 days. This time is given to the subsequent corn, allowing the change from early-maturing corn to mid-late maturing corn, greatly enhancing corn's yield potential.

Reporter: If corn's yield potential is to be fully utilized at the expense of wheat yield, it would be like picking up sesame seeds while dropping watermelons for the Chinese people who love fine grains.

Wang Shu'an: The problem lies here. Wheat is the main staple food of the Chinese people, especially in the north. Only by ensuring that the yield of late-sown wheat is not lower than that of autumnal equinox wheat can it be widely adopted in production practice.

We are accustomed to giving way to everything for wheat. Wheat occupies the best growth period and water conditions. Some say this is "promoting autumn with summer," but in reality, it is "squeezing autumn with summer." Because wheat is a C3 plant, although it consumes a large amount of water and fertilizer, it is difficult to increase yield. Corn is a C4 plant with great yield potential. The vigorous growth period of corn is in the high-temperature and rainy season of July and August, synchronizing with rain and heat. If the growth period is extended, it will have a significant impact on yield, achieving high yield while saving water, labor, and energy input. Insufficient understanding of corn's yield potential and the lack of a matching cultivation technology system have artificially caused low and unstable autumn grain yield, which is an important reason why grain yield cannot be broken through.

Reporter: What is the difference between C3 and C4 plants?

Wang Shu'an: Generally speaking, C4 plants have a higher photosynthetic efficiency than C3 plants, meaning that under the same light, water, and fertilizer conditions, C4 plants grow faster than C3 plants, appearing larger, sturdier, and more full of fruit. Plants like corn, sorghum, and sugarcane are all C4 plants.

Reporter: Professor Wang, you are a wheat expert and a member of the wheat expert advisory group of the Ministry of Agriculture. Why don't you advocate for wheat but instead propose that "wheat should give way to corn"?

Wang Shu'an: Precisely because I am very familiar with wheat and understand that its yield potential is not great, I have the qualifications to put forward this view. From a macro perspective, the key to increasing grain yield lies in corn, not wheat. Currently, China is short of grain, mainly feed grain, not staple food.

Reporter: If the wheat sowing period is delayed, it will inevitably increase weak seedlings. If you want to prevent wheat from reducing yield, what method will you use to solve this?

Wang Shu'an: Late-sown wheat, most of the seedlings are of the third category. We can increase the number of seedlings per mu by increasing the sowing quantity, from the original 200,000 to 250,000 per mu to 400,000 to 450,000 per mu. At the same time, late-sown wheat will have four problems: "small old seedlings," weak stems, late heading, and easy lodging in the later stage. Therefore, when sowing, it is necessary to ensure the application of phosphorus fertilizer, the seeds should not be sown too deep, and watering should be moderate, not winter irrigation, and no irrigation during the green-up period. By strictly controlling nitrogen fertilizer during the seedling stage and applying more fertilizer during the jointing stage, it can be achieved that the late-sown wheat heads out at the same time as the normally sown wheat. Late-sown wheat has a high density, fast spring growth, and a large population, making it easier to lodge than normal seedlings. Therefore, fertilizer should be applied late, and watering should be late.

Reporter: The wheat yield is maintained, but increasing corn from 400 kilograms to 600 kilograms per mu is also a big challenge.

Wang Shu'an: There are also four difficulties in increasing corn yield. First, it is necessary to ensure the density. The conventional seedlings are 2,000 per mu, now it needs to be increased to 5,000, which requires a lot of effort to convince the masses. Second, after increasing the density, it is easy to have empty stalks that do not bear ears, affecting the yield. As long as the small seeds are screened out before sowing and the seedlings are thinned later, the problem can be solved. Third, it is necessary to solve the lodging problem. We adopt the method of not plowing before sowing and conducting "iron stubble sowing," which can effectively prevent lodging. Fourth, there may be shrunken grains. But as long as one watering is applied during the grain-filling period, it can reduce the occurrence of shrunken grains and not reduce the yield.

Reporter: These technical measures do not seem complicated. If they are to be promoted in rural areas, there may still be some difficulties.

Wang Shu'an: One ton of grain must take the road of high yield and water-saving, intensive water use. Using one-ton grain technology, plastic soft tube irrigation, wheat is irrigated four times, corn once, each mu requires 30 cubic meters of water, a total of 150 cubic meters of water, 1 cubic meter of water produces 6.65 kilograms of grain, the water utilization rate is actually 4.65 times higher than before. This year, our experimental area has expanded to 3,000 mu. The wheat sown in the 145 mu of one-ton grain fields last year has better growth than last year. We and the masses have calculated a detailed account, the economic benefits of one-ton grain fields are higher than conventional planting, and local farmers are very supportive.

Reporter: What is the basic factor limiting the one-ton grain technology? Which regions is this technology suitable for?

Wang Shu'an: The most basic factor limiting one-ton grain is the number of irrigations for spring wheat, although the total water requirement is not large. According to the water volume in Wuqiao, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and other provinces and cities can adopt the one-ton grain technology.

    在我国北方许多地区，粮食大幅度增产是完全可能的。关键是观念的转变，改变长期存在的偏爱小麦、忽视玉米的传统耕作习惯——北方有可能亩产吨粮
　　北方有可能亩产吨粮
    本报记者  蒋建科
    王树安，１９２９年７月生，北京农业大学农学系教授，一直从事小麦栽培理论和技术的研究和教学，原农学系系主任，中国作物学会栽培研究会副主任委员，北京市政府小麦技术顾问，北京农学会副理事长。
    记者：我国人口逐年增加，水资源也日益贫乏，粮食产量几年来却徘徊不前。您认为，要增产粮食，还有哪些途径？
    王树安：这正是我们研究的课题。从“六五”到“七五”，在参加黄淮海科技攻关期间，我们在河北省沧州地区吴桥县范屯乡，与当地干部、农技人员一道进行夏秋粮均衡增产栽培体系的攻关研究，探索出晚麦亩产４００公斤，中晚熟玉米亩产５５０—６００公斤的节水高产技术，找到了全年亩产吨粮（即平均亩产达１０００公斤）的一条新途径。
    记者：这会不会是吃了“偏方”，或栽培条件特别优惠呢？
    王树安：我们既没用优良品种，也没多施什么优质化肥。采用的小麦品种是当地常用的“鲁麦８号”，玉米品种是“掖单４号”。过去传统的观念是秋分时节一定要播种小麦，为了抢着种麦子，玉米必须让路，用早熟品种。现在我们突破了祖先传下来的种麦习惯，改秋分麦为晚播麦，推迟小麦播种期１０到１５天，把这些时间让给下茬玉米，这样就可以改早熟玉米为中晚熟玉米，极大地发挥玉米的增产潜力。
    记者：如果为了发挥玉米的增产潜力而牺牲小麦的产量，对爱吃细粮的中国人来说无异于抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜。
    王树安：问题就在这里。小麦是我国人民、特别是北方人喜爱的主要口粮，只有保证晚播麦的产量不低于秋分麦的产量，才能在生产实践上被广泛采用。
    我们习惯于一切为小麦让路，小麦占去了最好的生育期和水分条件。有人说这是“以夏促秋”，实际上是“以夏挤秋”。因为小麦是Ｃ３作物，虽然消耗大量水肥，再增产也很难。玉米是Ｃ４作物，增产潜力很大，玉米生长的旺盛期，正值７—８月高温多雨季节，与雨热同步，如能延长生育期对产量影响很大，既高产，又节省了水、工、能量的投入。对玉米增产潜力认识不足，栽培技术体系不配套，人为造成秋粮产量低而不稳，是粮食产量不能突破的一个重要原因。
    记者：Ｃ３作物与Ｃ４作物究竟有什么不同？
    王树安：笼统地讲，Ｃ４作物比Ｃ３作物的光合效率高，就是在同等的光照和水肥条件下，Ｃ４作物比Ｃ３作物生长得快，显得个大、秆粗、果实饱满，像玉米、高粱、甘蔗等都是Ｃ４作物。
    记者：王教授，您是小麦专家，又是农业部小麦专家顾问团的成员，怎么不为小麦说话，反而提倡“小麦要为玉米让路”？
    王树安：正因为我对小麦很熟悉，了解它的增产潜力并不大，我才有资格提出这一观点。从全局来说，粮食增产的关键是在玉米而不是小麦。现在我国缺粮，主要是缺饲料粮，而不是缺口粮。
    记者：如果推迟小麦播种期，肯定要增加弱苗，若想让小麦不减产，用什么方法来解决？
    王树安：晚播小麦，苗期大多数是三类苗，可用增加播种量的办法来增加每亩苗数，使原来的每亩苗数由２０至２５万增加到４０至４５万。同时，晚播小麦会出现“小老苗”、弱株、抽穗晚，后期易倒伏４个问题。因此播种时要保证磷肥施用量，种子不能播得太深，浇水要适量，不冬灌，返青期也不灌。通过严格控制苗期氮肥，重施拔节肥可以做到与正常播种的小麦同时抽穗。晚播小麦密度大、春季生长快，群体大，比正常苗易倒伏，应该晚施肥，晚浇水。
    记者：小麦产量保住了，但玉米要由４００公斤一下子增加到６００公斤，困难也不小吧？
    王树安：玉米增产也有４个难关。一是要保证密度，常规苗每亩２０００棵，现在要增加到５０００棵，得花大气力说服群众。二是密度加大后很容易出现不结棒子的空秆，影响产量，只要在播种前筛掉小的籽粒，定苗时间晚点就能解决。三是要解决倒伏问题。我们采取播种前不翻地，进行“铁茬播种”，能有效防止倒伏。四是可能会出现瘪粒。但只要灌浆时浇一水就能保证减少瘪粒出现机会，不致降低产量。
    记者：这些技术措施听来并不复杂，如果要在农村推广开来，恐怕还有一定的困难。
    王树安：吨粮必须走节水高产、集约用水的道路。采用吨粮技术，塑料软管灌溉，小麦浇４水，玉米１水，每亩３０方水计，共需１５０方水，１方水产粮６．６５公斤，水分利用率反而比过去提高４．６５倍。今年，我们试验区扩大到３０００亩，在去年１４５亩吨粮田上播种的小麦长势好于去年。我们和群众算了一笔细帐，吨粮田比常规种植经济效益高，当地农民十分拥护。
    记者：限制吨粮技术的基本因素是什么？这种技术适合哪些地区？
    王树安：限制吨粮的最基本因素是春季小麦的浇水次数，尽管总的需水量不大。按吴桥的水量估算，河北、北京、天津、山东、河南、安徽等省市都可以采用吨粮技术。
