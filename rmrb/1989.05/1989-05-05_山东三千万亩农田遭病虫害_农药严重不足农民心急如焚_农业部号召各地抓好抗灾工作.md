Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 5th. (Reporter: Yǐn Jiànhuá) The area of various crops in Shandong Province affected by pests and diseases has reached 29.77 million mu. Due to a severe shortage of pesticides, the pests and diseases are continuing to spread, leaving farmers in a state of anxiety.

This year, the occurrence of pests and diseases in Shandong's farmlands is earlier and more severe than in previous years. According to the provincial plant protection station, the main pests and diseases that pose a serious threat to agriculture include mole crickets, red spider mites on wheat, wheat gall midges, and underground pests in wheat fields. Among these, the area affected by mole crickets is 300 million mu more than the same period last year. In severely affected areas, there are more than 100 mole crickets per square meter, devouring crops at an alarming rate.

Due to the severe shortage of pesticides, it is difficult to control the pests and diseases. In the suburbs of Tai'an City, wheat fields infested with red spider mites are facing the risk of total crop failure due to the lack of appropriate pesticides. In some villages in Zaozhuang City, mole crickets have swarmed, and farmers, lacking pesticides, can only resort to catching and stomping them by hand.

The shortage of pesticides is mainly due to a large gap in supply. According to the provincial agricultural production materials company, the annual demand for pesticides is 70,000 tons, but the total supply from provincial production, national allocation, and existing inventory is only 40,000 tons.

In other news, to ensure a bumper harvest of summer grains and oils, the Ministry of Agriculture has called on all regions to further intensify efforts in the anti-disaster and field management work for summer grain and oil crops in the latter part of the growing season, in response to the current trend of disasters.

　　山东三千万亩农田遭病虫害    
    农药严重不足农民心急如焚 
    农业部号召各地抓好抗灾工作
    据新华社济南５月５日电  （记者尹建华）山东省各类农作物发生病虫害面积目前已达２９７７万亩。因农药严重不足，病虫害继续蔓延，农民心急如焚。
    今年山东农田病虫害发生之早，来势之猛，超过往年。据省植保站调查，已给农业造成严重威胁的主要病虫害有土蝗、小麦红蜘蛛、麦叶蜂、麦田地下害虫等。其中土蝗发生面积比去年同期多３００多万亩，严重地块每平方米有土蝗百头以上，以惊人速度吞噬着庄稼。
    由于农药严重不足，病虫害难以控制。泰安市郊区发生红蜘蛛的麦田，因缺少对症的农药，面临绝产危险。枣庄市有的村土蝗暴发，农民无药可用，只好手捕脚踩。
    农药供应不足，主要是货源缺口太大。据省农业生产资料公司反映，全年共需农药７万吨，而省内生产、国家分配加上原有库存，仅有４万吨。
    又讯　为了确保今年夏季粮油丰产丰收，农业部针对当前灾害发生趋势，号召各地进一步抓紧抓好夏收粮油作物后期抗灾和田间管理工作。
