Title: The Theory of "Reasonable Sufficiency" for Soviet Military Power

Gorbachev first proposed at the 27th Congress of the CPSU in 1986 that Soviet military power should be "limited to a reasonable and sufficient range." Over three years have passed, and the Soviet Union has repeatedly justified this principle and gradually put it into practice, forming its new strategy. The "reasonable sufficiency" principle, in its direct meaning, seems to only address the issue of Soviet military power construction. However, it actually involves major issues such as Soviet military strategic goals, strategic actions, and strategic means construction. It is the manifestation of "new thinking" in the overall Soviet military strategy.

Currently, the Soviet Union has shifted from emphasizing absolute security for its own country to emphasizing "common security," that is, "national security and international security are inseparable," and "one cannot guarantee one's own security without considering the security of others." For example, according to the Soviet security theory of the past, the more medium-range missiles it had in Central Europe, the more secure the Soviet Union would be. However, according to the current theory, this does not guarantee its own security. If medium-range missiles are actually used, the Soviet Union and Western Europe would both suffer. Therefore, while maintaining strategic weapons, to reduce economic pressure, the Soviet Union signed an agreement with the United States to completely eliminate medium-range missiles. The Soviet Union has already proposed that "the construction of Soviet military power must also serve the needs of economic construction." To this end, it is necessary to change the past practice of "placing national defense construction in the first place" and "the Soviet army will get everything it needs." The Soviet announcement to reduce its military by 500,000 and cut military spending by 14.2% can be seen as an embodiment of this "reasonable" theory.

On this basis, the Soviet Union has formally proposed a "purely defensive" military strategy and uses this as the standard for measuring "sufficiency." Soviet Defense Minister Yazov explained that sufficiency means "having the necessary armed forces for defense" and "reducing military power to a level where either side has only defensive and no offensive capabilities." To this end, the Soviet Union has already clearly promised in strategic weapons negotiations to reduce the SS-18 intercontinental ballistic missiles, which are mainly used for preemptive strikes, by half; in European conventional arms negotiations, it is willing to significantly reduce tanks, artillery, and armored vehicles, which are offensive weapons; and it has announced the withdrawal of 6 tank divisions and landing and bridge units from Eastern Europe, gradually changing the composition of troops stationed in Eastern Europe from offensive to defensive.

Gorbachev proposed that "no country in the world today can defend itself solely through military technical means" and that "security issues must be resolved through political means." Therefore, the Soviet Union advocates for large-scale reductions in military equipment in various arms control negotiations. However, the Soviet proposal of the "reasonable sufficiency" principle does not mean that it has abandoned its policy of strength. The Soviet Union is currently seeking a low-level quantitative balance and high-level qualitative development in military equipment. Gorbachev emphasized at the 19th Plenary Session of the CPSU that in the future, the focus of Soviet military construction should be shifted to "quality indicators." Currently, the Soviet military is taking active measures in various aspects such as combat readiness training, organizational structure, new weapon research, officer quality, and military scientific research to improve the quality of the military to make up for the reduction in quantity and ensure that the overall combat effectiveness of the Soviet army does not weaken. The current acceleration of the deployment of SS-25 mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles, the start of construction of new aircraft carriers, the active research and development of long-range cruise missiles, and laser weapons and other new-generation high-tech weapon systems are proof of this.

It is worth noting that the Soviet military has strong resistance in implementing the "reasonable sufficiency" principle. It is reported that Soviet military leaders and military newspapers especially emphasize that "the threat of war from imperialism has not decreased" when explaining the "reasonable sufficiency" principle and propagandize that "it is precisely the balance in military strategy that guarantees peace and security." Yazov has said that the degree of "reasonable sufficiency" will be "determined by the actions of the United States and NATO," and the implication is self-evident. For many years, the Soviet Union has pursued an offensive military strategy and maintained a large military arsenal. It is not easy to fundamentally change this situation in practice. Whether the "reasonable sufficiency" theory of Soviet military power can be implemented remains to be observed.

　　苏联军事力量的“合理足够”论
    郭争平
    戈尔巴乔夫曾于１９８６年苏共２７大报告中首次提出，将苏军事力量“限制在合理足够的范围之内。”３年多过去了，苏联对此原则进行了多次反复论证，并逐步付诸实践正在形成它的新的战略。“合理足够”原则从其直接涵义看，似乎只是指苏军事力量的建设问题，但实际上它涉及了苏联的军事战略目标、战略行动方式和战略手段建设等重大问题，是“新思维”在苏联军事战略全局上的表现。
    现在，苏联在理论上已从过去一味强调绝对保障本国安全转向强调“共同安全”，即“国家安全与国际安全不可分割”，“若不考虑别国安全就不能保障自身安全”。譬如，按苏过去的安全理论，它在中欧拥有的中程导弹优势越多，苏就将越安全，而按现行理论，这并不能保障自身安全，中导者真使用，苏联与西欧将“一损俱损”。所以苏联在保持战略武器的同时，为减轻经济压力，同美国签署全面销毁中导的协议。苏联业已提出“苏军事力量建设也必须服从经济建设的需要”，为此要改变过去“将国防建设放在首位”，“苏军将得到它所需要的一切”的作法。苏宣布裁军５０万和削减军费１４．２％，可看作是这一“合理”论的体现。
    在此前提下，苏联还正式提出了“纯防御”性军事战略，并以此作为衡量“足够”的标准。苏联国防部长亚佐夫解释说，足够就是要“拥有防御所必需的那么多的武装力量”，“把军事力量削减到任何一方只有防御而无进攻能力的水平”。为此，苏在战略武器谈判中已明确承诺将主要用于先发制人打击的ＳＳ—１８洲际导弹削减一半；在欧洲常规裁军谈判中表示愿意大规模裁减坦克、大炮、装甲车等进攻性武器；并宣布从东欧撤出６个坦克师及登陆和舟桥部队，将驻东欧部队编制从进攻型逐步改编为防御型。
    戈尔巴乔夫提出“当今世界任何一个国家都不能单靠军事技术手段来保卫自己”，“只有通过政治手段来解决安全问题”。所以苏联在各种裁军谈判中都主张大规模裁减军备数量。但苏提出“合理足够”原则决非表示其放弃了实力政策。苏联目前谋求的是军备数量上低水平均衡、质量上高水平发展。戈尔巴乔夫在苏共１９次代表会议上强调，今后苏联军队建设重点要转到“质量指标”上来。目前苏军正在战备训练、编制体制、新武器研制、军官素质、军事科学研究等各方面采取积极措施，以军队质量的提高来弥补数量的下降，保证苏军总战斗力不致削弱。现苏正加速部署ＳＳ—２５机动洲际导弹、开始建造新型航空母舰、积极研制远程巡航导弹、激光武器等新一代高技术武器系统等就是证明。
    值得注意的是，苏联军方在贯彻“合理足够”原则方面存在着较强的抵触情绪。据透露，苏联军队领导人和苏军报刊在解释“合理足够”原则时特别强调“来自帝国主义的战争威胁并未降低”，宣传“正是因为军事战略上的平衡才保障了和平与安全”。亚佐夫说过，“合理足够”的程度将“由美国和北约的行动来决定”，其弦外之音不言自明。多年来苏联推行进攻性军事战略，保持庞大军备，要根本改变这种状况在实践中决非易事。苏联军事力量“合理足够”论能否落实，还有待进一步的观察。
