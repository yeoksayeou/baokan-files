People's Daily, May 25th, Gorbachev was elected as a candidate for the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR at the Soviet People's Congress.

Gorbachev said, "I would like to ask you to believe in this principle first: I support the path we have already taken: supporting reform, innovating our society on the basis of democracy, openness, respect for people, and improving the status of every individual in our society. I am faithful to this line and will not pursue another policy.

I thank comrades for their support. I assure you that any bureaucratic dealings, detachment from the masses, and stagnation are unacceptable to me. I advocate dialogue within the country and the party with all strata and social movement organizations, even if they are sometimes unbearable, and even if they forget the main values and our achievements, we must insist on dialogue. Moreover, we should discuss everything that happens in our country. The main principle is to make the most of what can be used.

Sometimes people accuse me of making the country a debating club. I want to say this: We are still in the stage of learning democracy, and we are always learning. We are establishing political civilization and mastering all democratic mechanisms.

Yes, we have many mistakes. Everyone is angry. Some people are using this situation to satisfy their political ambitions, from the perspective of promotion and other considerations. But the situation is not determined by them. I think we can only act this way. Otherwise, it means we do not believe in our people, do not believe in socialism. The essence of socialism is that it is a system for the working people and for the working people. This is why we must follow this path and accumulate experience.

Of course, the reform is difficult, and the current tense situation has not made me lose my way, because we have entered the most difficult stage of reform. But we have basically formed this policy in principle and in essence. This policy requires refinement and deepening in all aspects.

The People's Congress is the first stage of reform, which shows that we have not made major mistakes in the main aspects. We have come a long way in many aspects, especially in self-awareness. I think we have chosen the correct strategic direction for our country. For peace, we have put forward a series of initiatives, and the world's attitude towards us has changed immediately. I think we have reached this stage, and we will do everything necessary for economic reform. We should think about how to promote political reform in the second stage. We should think about how to unite the people in our society through ideological renewal, through the promotion of morality, and through the promotion of values that we all swear to cherish.

Can we handle the problem this way, that is, use the army to restore order, and take actions like those taken in Tbilisi? I want to say directly: the army should do its own job. This is the view of the Politburo and the government. We should do everything possible to prevent the situation from developing to this point at any time. Some people say, how did the army appear there? I think you know, we asked our army to help the police to prevent the events that happened in Sumgait and to maintain order. Indeed, this should be discussed. We should consider a way to make sure that no one doubts this point: someone wants to mobilize the army to suppress the people. To maintain stability, when necessary, we will mobilize all forces: political forces, organizational forces, police, activists, the people, and all forces. All of this should be discussed and decided by the Supreme Soviet, and the most major issues affecting the fate of the nation should be decided by the Soviet People's Congress.

I thank you for your support. You can rest assured that I will not use my current and future position to do what I have opposed. I will strive to carry out the democratic policy to the end, so that what has happened in our lives will never happen again."

　　戈尔巴乔夫在苏联人大发表讲话说
    苏联在树立政治文明和民主机制
    涉及国家命运的重大问题要由人代会决定
    本报讯  在５月２５日的苏联人民代表大会上，戈尔巴乔夫在被推选为苏联最高苏维埃主席候选人时发表了讲话。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，我想请你们首先相信这样一个原则，即我拥护我们已经踏上的道路：拥护改革，拥护在民主、公开性、尊重人、提高每一个人在我们社会中地位的基础上革新我们的社会，我忠于这条路线，不推行另外一种政策。
    我感谢同志们的支持。我向你们保证，任何官僚主义勾当，脱离群众，故步自封对我来说都是不能接受的。我赞成在国内和党内同各阶层和所有社会运动组织进行对话，哪怕它们有时令人难以忍受，甚至它们忘记了主要价值和我们的成果，也要坚持对话。而且对我们国家所发生的一切，我们都应该进行对话。主要的原则是，能利用的尽量利用。
    有时人们指责我，说国内被辩论俱乐部搞得乌烟瘴气。对此，我想这样说：我们还处在学习民主的阶段，一直在学习。我们在树立政治文明，掌握一切民主机制。
    是的，我们有许多失误。大家火气很大。有些人为了满足政治奢望，从升官的立场出发以及其他考虑，正在利用这种形势。但是，形势不是由他们来决定的。我想，我们只能如此行事。不如此，就意味着我们不相信自己的人民，不相信社会主义。社会主义的实质就在于它是劳动人民的制度和为了劳动人民的制度。这就是为什么我们应当走这条道路并积累经验。
    当然，改革步履艰难，目前的紧张形势没有使我迷失方向，因为我们进入了改革的最困难阶段。但我们原则上和基本上形成了这种政策。这种政策在各个方面要求加工和深化。
    代表大会是改革的第一阶段，它表明我们在主要方面没有犯错误。我们在许多方面已走得很远，尤其是在自我认识方面。我认为，我们为自己的国家选择了正确的战略方向。为了和平，我们提出了一系列倡议，全世界对我们的态度立刻发生了变化。我认为，我们已经发展到了这个阶段，我们将做经济改革所必要的一切事情。我们应当想一想，在第二阶段，如何推动政治改革。我们应当想一想，在我们社会里如何通过意识形态更新、通过弘扬道德、弘扬我们大家发誓珍视的价值来团结人民。
    我们能否这样处理问题，就是说使用军队整顿秩序，采取像在第比利斯采取的那种行动？我要直截了当地说：军队应当做自己的事情。这就是政治局和政府的看法。我们应当尽一切努力，在任何时候都不要使事态发展到这种地步。有人说，那里怎么出现了军队？我认为，你们知道，我们请求我们的军队帮助民警，来防止发生在苏姆盖特所发生的那样事件，来维护秩序。确实，这是应当讨论的。应当考虑一种办法，让谁也不要怀疑这样一点：有人想调动军队去镇压人民。为了保持稳定，必要时，我们要调动一切力量：政治力量、组织力量、民警、积极分子、人民等一切力量。所有这一切都应当在最高苏维埃讨论和通过决定的基础上进行，而涉及国家命运的最重大问题，则要由苏联人民代表大会来作出决定。
    我感谢你们对我的支持。你们可以放心，我不会利用自己当前的和明天的地位来做我曾经反对过的事。我将努力把民主方针贯彻到底，使我们生活中曾发生过的事情永远不会再次出现。
