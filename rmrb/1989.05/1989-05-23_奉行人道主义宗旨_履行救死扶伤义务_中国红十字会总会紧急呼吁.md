Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 23rd.

The Chinese Red Cross Society adheres to the principles of humanitarianism and fulfills the duty to save lives and heal the injured. In recent days, we have been engaged in health services for the students who have been fasting and sitting in protest at Tiananmen Square. Given the current dire environment at the square, there is a high risk of a large-scale outbreak of diseases, with potentially disastrous consequences. To ensure the health of the patriotic students and the people of the capital, to restore normal social order in the capital, and to minimize losses on all fronts, we make the following urgent appeals:

1. To take responsibility for the students' health, we hope that all medical units will support and not withdraw the emergency vehicles, facilities, and medical stations currently set up at Tiananmen Square.

2. The current pollution at Tiananmen Square is severe, with piles of garbage. We urgently appeal to the departments of epidemic prevention, environmental sanitation, and food hygiene to continue organizing efforts to clean up the garbage, disinfect the environment, cut off the transmission routes of diseases, control the sources of infection, and conduct health supervision on food and drinking water.

3. Given the reality of the overcrowded and severely polluted conditions at the square, which continue to worsen, we urgently appeal to the students to leave the square as soon as possible. We also hope that citizens, especially the elderly and children, will not go to the square. The government should provide necessary conditions for the students (including those from outside the capital) to leave.

4. The students leaving the square is in the interest of the greater good. The government should welcome this. After the students leave, the government should ensure that the channels for dialogue between student representatives and the government remain open.

5. We will urge the government to fulfill its promise not to hold students accountable after the fact.

6. We hope that the government and the students can both consider the greater good, prioritize national unity, respond to our sincere appeal, and we also appeal to all sectors of society to support the Chinese Red Cross Society's urgent appeal.

　　奉行人道主义宗旨　履行救死扶伤义务
    中国红十字会总会紧急呼吁
    本报讯  中国红十字会总会５月２３日发出紧急呼吁书，全文如下：
    中国红十字会奉行人道主义宗旨，履行救死扶伤的义务。几天来一直从事天安门广场绝食静坐请愿学生的健康服务工作。鉴于广场目前环境恶劣，随时可能发生大规模的疾病爆发流行，后果不堪设想，为确保爱国学生和首都人民的健康，为恢复首都的正常社会秩序并减少各方面的损失，我们做如下紧急呼吁：
    １、为对学生的健康负责，希望各医疗单位支持，不要撤离目前设在天安门广场的所有急救车辆、设施和医疗点。
    ２、天安门广场目前污染严重，垃圾成堆，我们恳请卫生防疫、环境卫生和食品卫生等部门继续组织力量清理垃圾、消毒环境，切断疾病传播途径，控制传染源。并对食品和饮水进行卫生监督。
    ３、鉴于广场人群密度过大，已被严重污染，并继续恶化的现实情况，我们紧急呼吁学生应尽快撤离广场。希望市民特别是老人、儿童不要前往。学生（包括外地学生）撤离时，请政府提供必要条件。
    ４、学生撤离广场是从大局出发，政府应予欢迎。撤离后要保证学生代表同政府对话渠道的畅通。
    ５、我们将敦促政府保证履行对学生不搞秋后算帐的诺言。
    ６、希望政府和学生都能从大局出发，注重民族大义，响应我们这一真诚的呼吁，也恳请社会各界支持中国红十字会的这一紧急呼吁。
