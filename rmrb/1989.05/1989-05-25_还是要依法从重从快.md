	Still Need to Strike Hard and Swiftly According to Law
	Liú Ēnqǐ

	I remember during the "Two Sessions," the deputies to the National People's Congress and the members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference called for maintaining a policy of striking hard and swiftly, severely cracking down on criminals, and establishing a good social order.

	People's concerns are not unfounded. According to recent statistics released by the public security authorities, in 1988, there were more than 820,000 criminal cases nationwide, an increase of 45.1% over 1987; among them, there were more than 200,000 major cases, an increase of 65.7%. In addition, there are frequent public order cases and public order disasters, and the increasingly severe social order problems are causing people's concern and worry. Good-hearted people once hoped that after a severe crackdown on criminals according to law, striking hard and swiftly, social order would fundamentally improve. However, the progress of history shows such an unsatisfactory contradiction: while reform and opening up bring great vitality to the economy and social life, they also bring many unprecedented social problems to the world, making social order face unprecedented complex situations. It can be predicted that to solve the problem of social order well and significantly reduce the crime rate, it will take a process.

	The long-term nature of the struggle against criminal offenses determines that for criminals who seriously endanger social order, we must continue to adopt the policy of striking hard and swiftly according to law, which is to uphold the dignity and authority of the Constitution and the law. It is not difficult to imagine that if we tolerate those who are addicted to evil and killing, using various cruel means to harm the people, endanger reform and construction, and if we allow lawbreakers to smash, loot, burn, and disrupt normal production order, work order, and social order, that would be a crime against the people.

	Emphasizing striking hard and swiftly to severely crack down on serious criminal activities is to operate within the scope of the law. The striking hard and swiftly we are talking about is within the scope of the Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, and the decisions passed by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which is to insist on acting according to law. Next, the objects of striking hard and swiftly according to law are specific criminals who seriously endanger social order, not all criminals. Under the premise of striking hard and swiftly according to law, for criminals who surrender, confess thoroughly, and expose and merit, they should still be treated differently. Of course, while striking hard and swiftly according to law to deal with serious criminal offenders, we must still fully implement the comprehensive management of social order.

### 还是要依法从重从快

　　还是要依法从重从快
    刘恩启
    记得“两会”开会期间，人大代表和政协委员们呼吁坚持从重从快，严厉打击犯罪分子，建立一个良好的社会秩序。
    人们的担心也并非杞人之忧。据近期公安部门公布的统计材料，一九八八年全国共立各种刑事案件八十二万多起，比一九八七年增加百分之四十五点一；其中，重大案件二十万多起，增加百分之六十五点七。再加上时有发生的治安案件、治安灾害事故，日趋严峻的社会治安问题正引起人们的关切和担忧。善良的人们曾经期望，经过一场对犯罪分子依法从重从快的严厉打击，使社会治安得到根本好转。然而历史的进步却表现为这样一种不尽如人意的矛盾状态：改革开放给经济和社会生活带来巨大活力的同时，也把许多前所未有的社会问题带到人间，使社会治安面临前所未有的复杂情况。可以预计，要把社会治安问题解决好，使犯罪率大幅度降下来，需要有一个过程。
    同刑事犯罪作斗争的长期性，决定了对严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，必须继续采取依法从重从快惩处的方针，这正是维护了宪法和法律的尊严与权威。不难想象，如果容忍那些嗜恶成癖、嗜杀成性的凶犯以种种残忍的手段加害于人民，危害改革和建设，如果听任不法之徒打砸抢烧，扰乱正常的生产秩序、工作秩序和社会秩序，那就是对人民的犯罪。
    强调从重从快严厉打击严重刑事犯罪活动，是指要在法律的范围内进行。我们所说的从重从快，是在刑法、刑事诉讼法和全国人大常委会通过的决定范围内从重从快，是坚持依法办事的从重从快；其次，依法从重从快惩处的对象，是特定的严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，并不是所有的犯罪分子；在依法从重从快的前提下，对于投案自首、彻底坦白、检举立功的犯罪分子，还是要区别对待的；当然，在依法从重从快惩处严重刑事犯罪分子的同时，仍然要全面落实综合治理社会治安的方针。
