The northern part of the Bohai Sea, from Shanhaiguan to the mouth of the Dalingshui River, covers 400 kilometers of nearshore and tidal flats under the jurisdiction of Jinzhou City. This area is rich in aquatic resources and was once known as the "Golden Coast." Today, pollution is worsening daily, and the variety and quantity of aquatic products have significantly decreased. Environmental and fisheries experts predict that if this trend continues, marine organisms could become extinct, and the "Golden Coast" will turn into a barren beach.

According to the China Environment News, the pollution in the "Golden Coast" comes from multiple sources, with coastal oil, chemical, metallurgical, fertilizer, and cement industries being the main culprits. Due to years of pollution from oil, mercury, lead, zinc, and cadmium, the yellow croaker production in Jinzhou waters has dropped from 6,000 tons in 1966 to 2 tons in 1970, and is now nearly extinct. The heavy metal content in many fish and shellfish exceeds national standards by 5 to 24 times. According to the 1988 environmental quality report from the Jinzhou Environmental Protection Bureau and data from over 20 monitoring stations in the nearshore area, the pollution levels of oil, mercury, hexavalent chromium, and pesticides in the main coastal rivers are higher than in 1987, leading to deteriorating coastal water quality.

The pollution in the "Golden Coast" is particularly severe in Jinzhou Bay. Due to serious sediment pollution, the migration, spawning, and other life habits of fish and shellfish in the bay have changed, leaving only three species of intertidal benthic organisms, with some areas becoming lifeless zones. The six major salt fields in the bay have all been contaminated, with cadmium pollution being the most severe.

Yang Fei, the former deputy mayor of Jinzhou City who has been focusing on environmental protection and now serves as a government advisor, said: Comprehensive treatment is difficult due to funding issues. Including treatment costs in production costs is not agreed upon by the finance and tax departments; annual applications for provincial funding have not been successful; several major polluting enterprises are under the jurisdiction of the ministries, and without their approval, the city has no way to proceed...

The pollution crisis predicted by experts four years ago has become a reality; now, experts are warning of even worse scenarios in the future.

### 污染年年增　水产日日减  锦州“黄金海岸”濒危

　　污染年年增　水产日日减    
    锦州“黄金海岸”濒危
    本报讯  渤海北部，山海关至大凌河口之间归锦州市所辖的４００公里近海和滩涂，水产富饶，过去有“黄金海岸”之称。如今，这里的污染日甚一日，水产品的种类和数量大减。环保和水产部门人士预言：长此下去，海生动植物就有绝种的可能，“黄金海岸”将变成荒滩。
    据中国环境报报道，“黄金海岸”的污染来自多方面，沿岸石油、化工、冶金、化肥、水泥等工矿企业则是主要污染源。因多年受油、汞、铅、锌、镉等污染，锦州海域的黄花鱼产量已由１９６６年的６０００吨下降到１９７０年的２吨，现几乎绝种；众多鱼、贝类体内的重金属含量均超过国家标准的５—２４倍。据锦州市环保局１９８８年环境质量年报和在近海上设的２０余个监测点监测表明，沿岸主要河流的油、汞、六价铬和农药的污染均高于１９８７年，并造成沿海水质变坏。
    “黄金海岸”的污染，尤以锦州湾为重，由于底质污染严重，使湾内的鱼、贝类回游、产卵等生活习性发生变异，现只剩３种潮间带底栖生物，有的滩面已成为无生物区。湾内的６个主要盐场的食盐均受到污染，以镉污染为重。
    一直主抓环保的原锦州市副市长、现任市政府顾问的杨非说：综合治理，难在治理资金的筹措上。将治理资金摊入成本吧，财政和税务都不同意；年年争取省里立项，却年年立不上；几个大的污染企业归属部里领导，综合治理之事，部里不表态，市里也没办法……
    ４年前专家预言的污染危机，已成事实；如今，专家们又在预言几年后的惨景……
