The Hong Kong Wen Wei Po reported on May 25 that some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress had signed a petition calling for an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee. The Macau Daily also published the same news on May 26. Both newspapers listed the names of Gao Dengbang, Wang Houde, Gu Ming, and Song Ruyi among the signatories. The four of us have never seen this petition (Gu Ming was abroad at the time), and we certainly did not sign it. This act of forging our names is a serious violation of our personal rights. It is particularly noteworthy that, at this critical moment, fabricating lies and confusing public opinion cannot but raise suspicions of ulterior motives.

Before May 25, someone from the "Four Communications Research Institute" called Wang Houde and Song Ruyi, claiming to be acting on behalf of a certain committee member, and asked for our signatures on a petition calling for an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee. Both Wang Houde and Song Ruyi declined. It is puzzling why committee members' signatures would require their involvement. It is even more baffling that, without obtaining our consent, they would disregard facts and laws, fabricating false information. We believe that this matter must be further investigated, and those responsible must be held accountable.

    四位全国人大常委会委员声明
    5月25日香港文汇报载，有些全国人大常委委员签名呼吁召开全国人大常委紧急会议。澳门日报5月26日也登载了同样的消息。这两个报纸上登载的签名中，都有高登榜、王厚德、顾明、宋汝棼的名字。我们四个人从未见过这个签名信（当时顾明正在国外），根本没有在这上面签过名。这种盗用我们姓名的做法，是对我们的人身权利的严重侵犯。特别需要指出的是，在这种严重时刻，编造谎言，混淆视听，不能不令人怀疑是否别有用心。
    在5月25日之前，曾经有“四通研究所”的人打电话给王厚德和宋汝棼，说是受某某委员的委托，希望在一封要求召开紧急常委会的信上签名，王厚德和宋汝棼均未表示同意。令人不解的是，为什么常委委员签名，他们要插手？更令人奇怪的是，为什么他们在没有得到同意之后，竟然置事实和法律于不顾，编造假情况？我们认为必须进一步查清，追究其责任。
