The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Party Group Reports to the Party Central Committee on the Situation of Studying and Implementing the Important Speeches by Central Leaders

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 30th: The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Party Group reports to the Party Central Committee on the situation of studying and implementing the important speeches by central leaders:

On May 20th, the responsible person of the Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Party Committee of the National People's Congress Office arranged for all staff and Party members to seriously study and discuss the important speeches given by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the Party, government, and military cadres meeting convened by the Party Central Committee and the State Council on the 19th. They required everyone to consider the overall situation, stay at their posts, do their work well, maintain political unity with the Central Committee, not believe in rumors and false information, and resolutely follow the Central Committee's deployment to strictly implement the martial law and act according to the Constitution and laws. On May 26th and 27th, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Party Group convened two meetings to transmit and discuss the important speeches given by Comrades Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, Qiao Shi, and Yi Lin after listening to the Party Group's report on the evening of May 22nd. On May 27th, the Party Committee transmitted and discussed the important speeches of Comrades Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, Qiao Shi, and Yi Lin among all Party members and cadres in the office.

Members of the Party Group, Party member deputies, and Party member cadres in the office believe that the major decisions made by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation reflect the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. They expressed their firm support. To defend the People's Republic of China, which was created by countless revolutionary martyrs who fought and sacrificed, we must, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, maintain political unity with the Central Committee, stand firm, and clearly oppose the turmoil. In this serious political struggle, we must not hesitate for a moment and must resolutely put down the turmoil instigated by a very few people. Otherwise, there will be no peace for the Party or the country.

The Constitution of our country stipulates: "The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants." In recent periods, a very few people have created turmoil, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China organizationally, overthrow the State Council, which is the central people's government produced by the National People's Congress in accordance with the law, and negate the state system of people's democratic dictatorship and the social system of socialism. This is a serious violation of the fundamental principles of the Constitution. The Constitution also stipulates, "Citizens of the People's Republic of China have freedom of speech, publication, assembly, association, procession, and demonstration," "Citizens shall not infringe upon the interests of the state, society, collectives, and other citizens' legitimate freedoms and rights when exercising their freedoms and rights." Under the instigation of a very few people, the order of production, work, teaching, scientific research, and the lives of the people have been seriously disrupted, actually falling into a state of serious chaos and anarchy, and laws and order have been seriously disrupted. This is not allowed by the Constitution and laws. To maintain the dignity of the Constitution and laws, resolutely stop the turmoil, restore normal social order, maintain stability and unity, and ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction, the State Council decided, in accordance with the provisions of Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution, to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing. This is completely correct and necessary.

Comrades believe that the broad masses of young students, out of patriotic enthusiasm, hope to promote democracy and rectify corruption, which is in line with the wishes of the Party and the government. It is necessary to strictly distinguish the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students from the very few people who instigate turmoil. Their reasonable suggestions, such as strengthening the construction of clean government and eliminating corruption, should be seriously addressed according to democratic and legal procedures. This can enhance the prestige of the Party and the government and strengthen cohesion.

Comrades expressed that Communist Party members in the work of the National People's Congress must, under the leadership of the Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, strengthen democratic and legal system construction, and strive to implement the Party's proposals in the National People's Congress.

    就学习贯彻中央领导同志重要讲话
    人大常委会党组向党中央报告情况
    新华社北京5月30日电  全国人大常委会党组关于学习贯彻中央领导同志重要讲话的情况报告党中央：
    5月20日，人大常委会办公厅负责人和人大机关党委布置全体机关工作人员和党员干部，认真学习讨论李鹏、尚昆同志19日在党中央、国务院召开的党政军干部大会上的重要讲话，并要求大家顾全大局；坚守岗位，做好工作；在政治上同中央保持一致，不要听信谣言和谣传，坚决按照中央的部署，认真执行戒严令，依照宪法和法律的规定办事。5月26日和27日，全国人大常委会党组分两批召集了在京的党员全国人大常委委员和人大机关司局级以上党员干部开会，传达讨论李鹏、尚昆、乔石、依林同志5月22日晚听取党组汇报后的重要讲话。5月27日，机关党委在机关全体党员干部中，传达讨论李鹏、尚昆、乔石、依林同志的重要讲话。
    党组成员和党员委员以及机关党员干部认为，中央政治局常委会、国务院为制止动乱、稳定局势所作出的重大决策，体现了全国各族人民的根本利益，表示坚决拥护。为了保卫无数革命先烈前仆后继、流血牺牲、艰苦奋斗创建的中华人民共和国，我们一定要在党中央领导下，在政治上坚决同中央保持一致，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明地制止动乱，在这场严肃的政治斗争面前，绝不能有丝毫的犹豫，要坚决把极少数极少数人挑起的动乱平息下去。否则，就会党无宁日，国无宁日。
    我国宪法规定：“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。”最近一个时期以来，极少数极少数人制造动乱，妄图从组织上颠覆中国共产党的领导，推翻全国人民代表大会依法产生的国务院即中央人民政府，否定人民民主专政的国家制度和社会主义的社会制度，是严重违反宪法的根本原则的。宪法还规定，“中华人民共和国公民有言论、出版、集会、结社、游行、示威的自由”，“公民在行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利”。在极少数人的煽动下，生产秩序、工作秩序、教学科研秩序和人民群众生活秩序，受到了严重的破坏，实际上陷入了严重的混乱的无政府状态，法律和秩序受到严重破坏。这是宪法和法律所不允许的。为了维护宪法和法律的尊严，坚决制止动乱，恢复社会正常秩序，维护安定团结，保证改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的顺利进行，国务院根据宪法第89条第16项的规定，决定在北京市部分地区实行戒严，是完全正确的、必要的。
    同志们认为，广大青年学生出于爱国热情，希望促进民主、整治腐败的要求，与党和政府的愿望是一致的。一定要切实做到把广大青年学生的爱国热情同挑动动乱的极少数极少数人严格区别开来。他们提出的加强廉政建设、消除腐败现象等合理建议，要按照民主和法制的程序认真加以解决，这样可以提高党和政府的威望，增强凝聚力。
    同志们表示，在人大工作的共产党员，一定要在中央的领导下，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，加强民主和法制建设，为在人大坚决贯彻党的主张而努力工作。

                                            1989年5月29日
