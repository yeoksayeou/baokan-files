The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held a meeting today to discuss political pluralism, stating that the socialist self-management system and socialist democracy cannot be replaced by a multi-party system.

The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held a meeting today to specifically discuss this issue to unify their views. The Central Committee believes that under the conditions of socialist self-management, political pluralism opens up the possibility for new democratic political activities and the elimination of political monopolies. Political pluralism can only be implemented within the framework of the socialist self-management system, and all political organizations can only operate within the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 24th.

The Polish Parliament on May 24th expressed support for the government's reform efforts under the leadership of Prime Minister Rakowski.

The 9th Polish Parliament held its 49th session on May 24th to review the government's report on the state budget, financial plan, and the implementation of the national economic plan for 1986-1988. Rakowski was appointed Prime Minister by the Parliament on September 27th of last year. When evaluating the economic situation last year, the deputies unanimously praised the reform actions of the Rakowski government. To this end, the Parliament passed a resolution to support the Rakowski government and called on all state institutions and the entire society to provide creative assistance to the Rakowski government.

The Parliament also passed a law regarding the restoration of jobs for dismissed workers, which was drafted based on the agreement reached by representatives of various social forces at the Round Table Conference.

The law stipulates that certain workers who were previously dismissed for participating in strikes or other political activities will be reinstated or reassigned to new jobs.

　　南共盟反对多党制
    波兰议会支持改革
    新华社贝尔格莱德５月２４日电  南共联盟中央主席团今天开会讨论政治多元化时指出，不能用多党制取代社会主义自治制度和社会主义民主。
    南共联盟中央主席团为了统一观点，今天举行会议专门讨论这一问题。南共联盟中央主席团认为，在社会主义自治的条件下，政治多元化为实现新的民主的政治活动方式和消除政治垄断开辟了可能性。政治多元化只能在社会主义自治制度范围内实行，各政治组织只能在南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟范围内开展活动。
    新华社华沙５月２４日电　波兰议会２４日对政府在拉科夫斯基总理领导下进行的改革活动表示支持。
    波兰第９届议会２４日举行第４９次会议，审议政府关于去年国家预算、财政计划和１９８６至１９８８年国民经济计划执行情况的报告。拉科夫斯基是在去年９月２７日被议会任命为总理的。议员们在评价去年经济形势的时候，纷纷对拉科夫斯基政府的改革行动表示赞赏。为此，议会专门通过一项议案，对拉科夫斯基的政府表示支持，并要求国家所有机构和整个社会给拉科夫斯基的政府以创造性的帮助。
    议会同时还通过了有关被开除工人恢复工作问题的法律，这项法律是根据各社会力量代表不久前在圆桌会议上达成的协议制订的。
    法律规定，以前因参加罢工或其他政治活动被开除的某些职工，将恢复或重新安排工作。
