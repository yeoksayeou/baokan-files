	Fear of Change and Resistance to Change

	— Observations on the Mindset of Individual Household Operators (Part Three)

	Zhang Jinli Li Qi

	Although the reform has been ongoing for 10 years, the fear of policy changes and the lack of trust in policies still remain as psychological barriers for individual household operators to make additional investments.

	Starting from last year, some people have taken advantage of the eagerness of certain Chinese people to go abroad, opening a new "channel" for going abroad. As long as one can pay, one can buy a qualification to study abroad. This has made many wealthy individual household operators flock to it.

	In a certain city, an individual household operator spent 20,000 yuan to "arrange" a passport for his wife, who did not even finish middle school, to study in Japan. Before she left, he repeatedly warned her: "You must do everything you can to get me a residence permit. When there are any signs of trouble, get me out too."

	Some individual household operators have planned to self-fund their studies abroad and then return to China as "overseas Chinese" businessmen to start enterprises. At that time, there would be no risks, and they could also enjoy all the "preferential treatments."

	Some do not understand or trust the policies. A street vendor who did not want to reveal his name told us: "Policies can make you rich, but they can also make you poor."

	The sudden wealth of individual household operators has indeed triggered some people's "envy." Thus, various named fees and levies have fallen on individual household operators. In a certain city in Sichuan, individual household operators were charged a rat extermination guarantee fee, and two cars were used to block a street where individual household operators were doing business, collecting the fee one by one. An individual household operator indignantly said: "We individual household operators are like the flesh of Tang Monk, everyone wants a bite."

	During the interviews, many individual household operators told us: "Haven't you heard? The first to stick out gets rotten, the gun shoots the first bird. Those who run large enterprises, one day they will definitely meet with misfortune."

	After making a lot of money, although they do not put much effort into expanding investments, they are quite active in donations, disaster relief, and purchasing national savings bonds. Some individual household operators want to leave a good impression in this area, so that when there are changes in the future, they will have some political capital, at least to arouse some sympathy from people.

	Some individual household operators carefully buy gold and silver with their money, and hide their account books carefully, no longer daring to show off their wealth. According to Xiao B, Lao B once advised Xiao B: "These years, I have seen it clearly, buying anything is not as good as buying gold. When the policy changes, others cannot snatch it away. It is valuable whenever you take it out."

	The wealth of individual household operators is often only revealed when it is stolen, burned in a fire, or seized illegally.

	In recent years, in Wuhan's Han Zheng Street, several individual household operators have had fires. On February 17, 1987, a fire affected three families, one of which had 270,000 yuan in cash and goods burned.

	Many individual household operators are uneducated. According to statistics from Guangzhou last year, out of 1,690 individual business operators, only one had a college degree, while nearly half had less than a primary school education.

	Many individual household operators are like underdeveloped infants. If they do not quickly absorb knowledge, they will find it very difficult to grow.

　　怕变防变    
    ——个体户心态观察之三
    张锦力　李琦
    虽然改革已经１０年，但是怕政策变，对政策不放心仍是影响个体户追加投资的心理障碍。
    前年开始，有人瞄准某些中国人急于出国的心理，开辟了一条新的出国“渠道”，只要能出钱，就可以买个出国留学资格。这使许多发了财的个体户趋之若鹜。
    某市有位个体户，花了２万元钱为不够初中水平的妻子“办”了个去日本留学的护照。临行时，千叮咛，万嘱托：“你一定想尽办法，给我弄个居留权，等有风吹草动，把我也弄出去。
    一些个体户则作这样打算：自费出国，然后再做为“华侨”客商回国办企业，那时候，不仅没有风险，还能享受一切“优惠”。
    有的对政策不理解，不信任。一位不愿吐露姓名的商贩对我们说：“政策能叫你发财，也能叫你一贫如洗。”
    个体户的冒富，也着实引发了一些人的“红眼病”。于是各种名目的收费和摊派落在个体户头上。四川某市向个体户收交灭鼠保证金，竟动用两部汽车堵住个体户做买卖的一条街，挨摊收缴。一位个体户义愤地说：“俺们个体户就像是唐僧肉，谁都想吃一口。”
    在采访过程中，很多个体户对我们说：“没听说吗？出头的椽子先烂，枪打出头鸟，那些办大企业的私营主们，将来准有一天倒霉”。
    赚了大钱以后，他们虽然在扩大投资方面下的功夫不大，可在捐赠、救灾、购买国库券等方面，则比较踊跃。有些个体户想在这方面给人们留下个好印象，以便将来有了变动，也有点政治资本，至少可唤起一部分人的同情。
    还有一些个体户小心翼翼地把钱买金、买银，并把帐本谨慎藏好，再也不敢露富。据小Ｂ讲，老Ｂ就曾这样告诫小Ｂ：这些年，我算看清了，买啥也不如买金子好，政策变了，别人也抢不去。啥时拿出来都值钱”。
    个体户的财富，往往只有在被偷窃、火烧及违法被搜查时，才能看到真相。
    近几年，武汉汉正街，曾经有几户个体户先后失火。１９８７年２月１７日一次火灾，殃及３家，其中一家烧毁的现金和物资达２７万元。
    许多个体户没有文化。据广州去年统计，１６９０位个体工商者，大专学历仅一人，而小学以下程度的近一半。
    相当多的个体户就像是个先天不足的婴儿，如果他们不加快汲取知识营养，他们是很难长大的。
