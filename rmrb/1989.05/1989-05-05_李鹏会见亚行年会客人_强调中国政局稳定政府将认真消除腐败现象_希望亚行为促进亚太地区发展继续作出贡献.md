Li Peng Meets Guests of the Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting

Stresses China's Political Stability, Government's Serious Efforts to Eliminate Corruption

Hopes ADB Continues to Contribute to the Development of the Asia-Pacific Region

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) — Premier Li Peng today pointed out, "In the process of building modernization, China needs support and assistance from other countries in the world. International economic organizations and many countries have already provided us with help, some in the form of funds, and others by establishing various joint ventures or wholly-owned enterprises in China. China will further improve the investment environment and welcomes businesspeople from around the world to invest in China. The Chinese side will fully cooperate."

Li Peng made these remarks at the Great Hall of the People while meeting with the heads of delegations and senior officials from various countries (regions) attending the 22nd Annual Meeting of the Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Beijing.

Li Peng praised the role of the ADB in the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region and said he was very pleased that this year's meeting was held in Beijing. He hoped the meeting would be a complete success. He mentioned that Ms. Gu Binrong led her delegation to attend the meeting, although she was not present tonight, but we still welcome them.

When talking about the recent student demonstrations and class boycotts in some parts of China, he pointed out that the government had taken correct, appropriate, and calm measures to handle the situation, preventing the situation from further spreading and escalating. This is also the result of the joint efforts of the government and students, including those who participated in the demonstrations and those who did not. Now most schools have resumed classes, and dialogue will continue. We are pleased about this. Although we do not approve of some actions taken by some students, their demands and proposals are consistent with the government's. For example, they demand the elimination of certain chaotic phenomena in our economic life, certain corruption among government officials and in society, the development of education and science, and the promotion of democracy. Therefore, we can deepen our understanding through dialogue.

Li Peng said: "I can responsibly tell everyone that China's political situation is stable. The government will strive to maintain national stability, prevent turmoil, and seriously overcome the shortcomings in our work and eliminate corruption."

　　李鹏会见亚行年会客人    
    强调中国政局稳定政府将认真消除腐败现象    
    希望亚行为促进亚太地区发展继续作出贡献
    本报北京５月５日讯  记者蒋千红、吴迎春报道：国务院总理李鹏今天指出，“中国在建设现代化过程中需要世界上其他国家给我们以支持和帮助，国际经济组织和许多国家已经向我们提供了帮助，这种帮助有的是资金上，有的是到中国来开办各种合资或独资的企业。中国将进一步改善投资环境，欢迎世界上的企业家到中国来投资，中国方面将予以充分合作”。
    李鹏总理是在人民大会堂会见正在北京参加亚洲开发银行理事会第二十二届年会的各国（地区）代表团团长和高级官员时说这番话的。
    李鹏赞扬了亚行对亚太地区各国经济发展所起的作用后指出，对亚行本届年会在北京举行感到非常高兴，希望年会能取得圆满成功。他说，郭婉容女士率团出席了本届年会，虽然她今天晚上没有到会，但我们仍然向他们表示欢迎。
    在谈到最近中国某些地方发生的学生游行和罢课时，他指出，政府采取了正确、妥善、冷静的方法加以处理，避免了事态的进一步蔓延和扩大。这也是政府和学生包括参加游行和没有参加游行学生的共同努力的结果。现在大部分学校已经复课，对话将继续进行，对此我们感到高兴。尽管我们对部分学生某些做法并不赞成，但他们提出的一些主张和要求和政府的主张和要求是一致的。比如，他们要求消除我们经济生活中的某些混乱现象、政府工作人员中和社会上存在的某些腐败现象，要求发展教育、科学事业，发扬民主。因此，我们可以通过对话加深理解。
    李鹏说：“我可以负责任地告诉大家，中国的政局是稳定的，政府将努力维护国家的安定，避免动乱，并将认真克服工作中的缺点，消除腐败现象。”
