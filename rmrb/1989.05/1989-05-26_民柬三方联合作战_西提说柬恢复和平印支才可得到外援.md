The three forces of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea jointly launched an operation on May 20, successfully dismantling two puppet local governments and liberating 14 villages.

The Democratic Kampuchea Radio today broadcasted this news, stating that the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea, the National Army of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea collaborated to launch an attack on the Vietnamese and Phnom Penh puppet forces in the Mele Mountain-Maheng Mountain area of Battambang Province on May 20. The operation resulted in the deaths of 7 Vietnamese soldiers and the injury of 13 others. Additionally, a batch of weapons and ammunition was destroyed and seized. The puppet governments of Kotachao and Samrong collapsed, and the 14 villages in these two districts are now under the control of the resistance forces of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.

This indicates that the three forces of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea are gradually strengthening their military cooperation.

The Thai Foreign Minister, Siddhi Savetsila, stated that unless peace and stability are restored in Cambodia, the three Indochinese countries will not be able to receive foreign aid and investment.

Siddhi made these remarks during a national conference held in Bangkok yesterday. The topic of his speech was "Thailand's Role in the Changing Situation in Indochina."

Siddhi also mentioned that Thailand hopes for an early political resolution to the Cambodian issue.
