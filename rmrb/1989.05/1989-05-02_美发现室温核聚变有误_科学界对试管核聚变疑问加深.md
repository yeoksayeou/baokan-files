Scientists from two prominent U.S. universities announced today that they have discovered significant errors in the "room-temperature nuclear fusion" experiment conducted by the University of Utah, further deepening the skepticism within the American scientific community regarding test-tube nuclear fusion.

At a discussion held by the American Physical Society in Baltimore, Nathan Lewis of the California Institute of Technology stated that his team replicated the experiments of Pons and Fleischmann and obtained similar results, including the production of heat. He believes that the so-called nuclear fusion phenomenon observed in the experiment can be explained by ordinary energy production processes, where the amount of heat generated is determined by the amount of electrical energy input. He said that the Utah experiment failed to accurately account for the input and output energy.

Furthermore, Lewis noted that the helium-4 detected in the experimental apparatus is not evidence of fusion occurring in the test tube, as its concentration is similar to that in ordinary air. He said that the Utah experiment did not properly exclude air containing helium-4.

Meanwhile, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that at least one crucial part of the Utah experiment is flawed. Ronald Parker, the head of the Nuclear Fusion Physics Laboratory at MIT, and Bitraso stated that in their replication of part of the Utah experiment, they did not detect the production of neutrons or gamma rays derived from them, nor did they observe any additional heat. In a second routine radiation source experiment, they found that the additional heat reported by the Utah scientists, supposedly produced by fusion, might actually be gamma rays naturally produced by the decay of radon gas. Parker believes that the explanations provided by Pons and Fleischmann are immature and that they may not have had time for critical testing before publishing their results on March 23.

　　美发现室温核聚变有误    
    科学界对试管核聚变疑问加深
    本报华盛顿５月１日电  记者仓立德报道：美国两家著名大学的科学家今天宣布，他们发现犹他大学的“室温核聚变”实验具有重大谬误，从而使美国科学界对试管核聚变的疑问再度加深。
    在美国物理学会于巴尔的摩市召开的讨论会上，加利福尼亚理工学院科学家内森·刘易斯说，他领导的小组重复了庞斯和弗莱希曼的实验，并取得包括热能在内的相同结果。他认为，实验产生的所谓核聚变现象可解释为普通的能量产生过程，即热能的大小决定于电力投入量的大小。他说，犹他大学的实验未能准确说明投入及产出的能量。
    此外，刘易斯认为，实验仪器中产生的氦—４也不是试管中产生聚变的迹象，其含量与普通空气相同。他说，犹他大学的实验未将含有氦—４的空气排除。
    与此同时，麻省理工学院科学家得出的结论是，犹他大学的实验至少有一个关键部分是错误的。该学院核聚变物理实验室领导人罗纳德·帕克以及比特拉索说，他们在重复犹他大学的部分实验中并未产生中子或其派生物伽玛射线，也未产生额外热能。在进行第二次常规放射源实验中，他们发现，犹他大学科学家在报告中所说的由聚变产生的额外热能，可能是氡气在衰变时自然产生的伽玛射线。帕克认为，庞斯和弗莱希曼的解释不够成熟，他们在３月２３日公布其实验结果之前也许未来得及进行批评性检测。
