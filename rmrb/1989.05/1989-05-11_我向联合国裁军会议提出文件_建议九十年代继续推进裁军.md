China's delegation today submitted a working document to the United Nations Conference on Disarmament, calling on the international community to seize the current favorable opportunity to take concrete measures to vigorously advance disarmament over the next 10 years, thereby ensuring international peace, security, and stability.

The working document points out that in recent years, encouraging changes have occurred in the international situation, and progress has been made in disarmament. However, the arms race between the superpowers continues, and new trends of improving quality and expanding into outer space have emerged.

The working document believes that the important goal of disarmament in the 1990s is to "halt the arms race, especially the nuclear arms race." The document states that the United States and the Soviet Union should take the lead in stopping the testing, production, and deployment of various types of nuclear weapons and significantly reducing their nuclear arsenals, thereby creating conditions for the process of comprehensive nuclear disarmament. As a first step, they should reach an agreement as soon as possible to reduce strategic nuclear weapons by 50%.

The working document suggests that other goals for disarmament in the 1990s include early conclusion of a comprehensive chemical weapons convention, early results from the European conventional arms negotiations, and prioritizing the issue of preventing an arms race in outer space.

The working document concludes, "Peace and development are the major issues of today's world. Pursuing disarmament is for both peace and development. To maintain international peace and security, aggression must be stopped, and regional conflicts must be resolved fairly and reasonably. All countries should strictly adhere to the United Nations Charter, develop relations on the basis of the five principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. At the same time, international economic relations should be improved to promote development and cooperation."

　　我向联合国裁军会议提出文件    
    建议九十年代继续推进裁军
    本报联合国５月１０日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国代表团今天向正在这里召开的联合国裁军审议委员会会议提出一项工作文件，要求国际社会把握当前有利时机，在未来的１０年中采取切实措施有力地推进裁军，以确保国际和平、安全和稳定。
    工作文件指出，近年来，国际形势中出现了令人鼓舞的变化，裁军取得了成就，但超级大国的军备竞赛仍在继续，并出现了转向提高质量和向外层空间扩展的新趋势。
    工作文件认为，９０年代裁军的重要目标是：“制止军备竞赛，特别是核军备竞赛”。工作文件说，美国和苏联应率先停止试验、生产和部署各类核武器和大幅度削减核武库，从而为全面核裁军的进程创造条件。作为第一步，它们应尽早达成削减５０％战略核武器的协定。
    工作文件建议９０年代裁军的其它目标是早日缔结全面禁止化学武器公约、欧洲常规裁军谈判及早取得成果、优先处理防止外空军备竞赛问题等。
    工作文件最后指出，“和平与发展是当今世界的重大问题。争取裁军既是为了和平，也是为了发展。为维护国际和平与安全，必须制止侵略，公正合理地解决地区冲突问题，各国应严格遵守《联合国宪章》，在互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则基础上发展关系，同时应该改善国际经济关系，促进发展和合作。”
