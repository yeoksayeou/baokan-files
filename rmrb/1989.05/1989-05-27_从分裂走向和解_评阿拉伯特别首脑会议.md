The Arab Summit that concluded in Casablanca, with Egypt's return to the Arab League and the general easing of relations among Arab countries as its main achievements, has opened a new chapter in the history of the Arab League. The meeting shows that Arab countries, following the global trend of détente, are gradually moving towards national unity, handling internal and external affairs with a moderate, realistic, and coordinated stance. The spirit of reconciliation replaces the severe division that has plagued the Arab world for a decade.

The main agenda of this summit, though focusing on the Palestinian issue, Lebanon, and relations between Iran and Iraq, saw a significant shift towards reconciliation among several Arab countries with deep-seated grievances. Leaders from Egypt and Libya, Syria and Egypt, and Syria and the PLO met for the first time in Casablanca. This trend towards reconciliation not only paves the way for the normalization of bilateral relations among these countries but also proves that the cohesion of the Arab nation can transcend differences and move towards the goal of Arab unity.

The Palestinian issue has always been the central concern of the Arab nation. In the Arab-Israeli conflict, Arab countries have paid a heavy price in their search for a common moderate strategy. From the Arab League's Fez Resolution to the 19th National Council of the PLO, Arab countries have established a moderate stance of resolving the Palestinian issue through political negotiations. This summit reaffirmed this stance of negotiations and, for the first time, included UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 in the official documents of the Arab League. This step, following the PLO's recognition of Israel's existence and its declaration to establish a Palestinian state neighboring Israel, marks another advance from the Fez Resolution. It indirectly acknowledges Israel's existence while demanding that the international community also recognize the legitimate existence of the Palestinian state, supporting the PLO's negotiating stance and contributing to the promotion of the Middle East peace process.

On the eve of this summit, the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union sent separate letters to King Hassan II of Morocco, influencing the Arab League from different angles regarding Shamir's election plan. Now, the heads of state of the Arab League unanimously support the PLO's rejection of the election plan aimed at suppressing the uprising and canceling the PLO's representative rights. However, they also expressed acceptance of internationally supervised elections as part of a comprehensive solution to the Palestinian issue after Israel's withdrawal, leaving room for future political maneuvering with Israel. This strategy of not closing the door appears to be beneficial in gaining more sympathy and support from the international community, and is also a clever response to the superpowers.

The lengthy and heated debates at this summit regarding the Lebanese crisis indicate that the current reconciliation is only preliminary, and there are still underlying factors that could lead to opposition. It is reported that most countries believe that the fundamental solution to the Lebanese crisis lies in the withdrawal of all foreign troops. Iraq, Jordan, Egypt, and other countries oppose Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory and propose that Syria withdraw its troops from Lebanon. Syria firmly rejected this. In the face of the stalemate, the summit finally adopted a compromise, emphasizing the realization of reconciliation between the two factions in Lebanon and calling for the maintenance of Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Arab media personnel believe that this is essentially putting the problem on hold, leaving it to the leaders of Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria to further mediate, aiming to achieve a ceasefire first and then elect a president. Generally, the outlook for the Lebanese crisis is not optimistic.

Participants at the summit believe that as long as each Arab Summit achieves a tangible result, the Arab nation will make progress. It is unrealistic to expect a single summit to resolve decades-old historical issues. Egypt's return to the Arab League and the easing of relations among Arab countries are enough to record a glorious page in the history of the Arab League at the Casablanca Summit.

### 从分裂走向和解——评阿拉伯特别首脑会议

　　从分裂走向和解
    ——评阿拉伯特别首脑会议
    本报记者  林皎明
    在卡萨布兰卡闭幕的本届阿拉伯特别首脑会议，以埃及回归阿盟、阿拉伯国家关系普遍缓和为主要成果，揭开阿盟历史新的一页。会议表明，阿拉伯各国随着世界的缓和潮流逐步走向民族团结，用温和、现实和协调的立场处理阿拉伯内外事务。和解精神代替阿拉伯世界１０年严重分裂状态。
    这次会议的主要议题虽然是巴勒斯坦、黎巴嫩和两伊关系问题，然而，人们注意到，阿拉伯世界几对积怨甚深的国家关系开始和解，其意义和影响深远。埃及和利比亚、叙利亚和埃及、叙利亚和巴解组织的领导人在卡萨布兰卡实现了多年来的首次会晤。这种和解趋势的发展，不仅将导致这些国家双边关系的正常化，而且证明阿拉伯民族的凝聚力是可以超越分歧、朝着阿拉伯团结的目标前进的。
    巴勒斯坦问题历来是阿拉伯民族关注的中心。在阿以争端中，阿拉伯国家为寻求共同的温和战略付出过很大代价。从阿盟非斯决议到巴勒斯坦第１９次全国委员会的决议，阿拉伯国家通过政治谈判途径解决巴勒斯坦问题的温和立场才得到确立。本届首脑会议再次重申这一和谈立场，而且将联合国安理会２４２号、３３８号决议第１次写进阿盟正式文件。这是继巴解组织承认以色列存在、宣布建立与以色列为邻的巴勒斯坦国以来，阿盟从非斯决议基础上向前迈出的又一步。它在间接承认以色列存在的同时，要求国际社会也承认巴勒斯坦国的合法生存权，标志着对巴解组织和谈立场的支持，也为推动中东和平进程作出贡献。
    本届首脑会议前夕，美苏两国领导人分别给摩洛哥国王哈桑二世写信，从不同角度就沙米尔的选举计划对阿盟施加影响。现在，阿盟各国元首一致支持巴解组织拒绝旨在镇压起义、取消巴解组织代表权的选举计划，但同时又表示接受在以色列撤军之后，作为全面解决巴勒斯坦问题一部分的有国际监督的选举，为今后的对以政治较量留下回旋余地。这种不把门关死的策略看来有利于争取国际社会更多的同情和支持，也是对超级大国一种巧妙的回答。
    本届首脑会议就黎巴嫩危机展开的长时间激烈辩论，说明目前的和解只是初步的，仍然潜伏着产生对立的因素。据透露，多数国家认为，黎巴嫩危机的根本解决有赖于所有外国军队撤出。伊拉克、约旦、埃及等国反对以色列侵占黎巴嫩国土，提议叙利亚从黎巴嫩撤军。叙利亚断然拒绝。在争执不下的僵局中，首脑会议最后采取折衷办法，强调实现黎巴嫩两派和解，呼吁维护黎巴嫩的主权和领土完整。阿拉伯新闻界人士认为，这实际上是先把问题挂起来，留待摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯和阿尔及利亚３国领导人进一步调解，争取首先实现停火，然后推选总统。一般认为，黎巴嫩危机的前景并不乐观。
    此间与会人士认为，每一届阿拉伯首脑会议只要实实在在地取得一项成果，阿拉伯民族便前进一步。幻想在一次会议上解决几十年遗留下来的历史遗案，显然是不切实际的。埃及回归阿盟、阿拉伯国家关系缓和，足以使卡萨布兰卡会议在阿盟历史上记录下光辉的一页。
