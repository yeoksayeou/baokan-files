The Lake North Province Public Security Bureau's Visa Office is known as a solemn "gate to the nation." In Lake North Province (excluding the Wuhan region), anyone who needs to leave the country for personal reasons must pass through this "gate."

"Money Cannot Buy a Passport"

To step out of the country, one needs a "passport."

Zhong Xiuhua, an employee of the Jiangling County Cultural Center, has a father who moved to Hong Kong many years ago and has substantial wealth. He urgently hopes that Zhong Xiuhua will move to Hong Kong to settle down. Zhong Xiuhua visited the then-deputy director of the Visa Office, Chen Gang, three times to offer gifts, all of which were returned. Zhong Xiuhua thought that since he didn't accept gifts, his application to leave the country would definitely be rejected. To his surprise, a few days later, Zhong Xiuhua received the approved documents to go to Hong Kong, and he was overjoyed.

In May 1987, a worker from the Jianghan Oilfield, Huang, applied to go to Hong Kong to inherit his father-in-law's property. Because he did not meet the conditions, the Visa Office did not process his application. Huang then asked someone to convey a message to Chen Gang: if he could approve his application to go to Hong Kong, he would be willing to give him a five-figure sum in RMB. Chen Gang bluntly told the messenger: "Please tell him that in our office, money cannot buy a passport."

Over the past three years, the seven officers in the office have refused to accept money and gifts more than 40 times, totaling over 24,000 RMB.

Unmoved by Personal Connections

Wang from Hanchuan County originally worked in Zhengzhou City. Because his application for self-funded study abroad was not approved, in November 1987, he left his husband and children and transferred to Hanchuan County in Lake North Province, attempting to use his father's "network" in Hanchuan to achieve his goal of going abroad. Two months after transferring to Hanchuan County, she applied to study abroad, but because she did not meet the regulations, her application was not approved. She then mobilized her network of people to plead on her behalf. Soon, people from all directions, relatives and friends, both in office and retired, came one after another, either writing notes, making phone calls, or giving instructions. Faced with all this, the officers of the Visa Office were not moved by personal connections in the slightest.

Li, who applied to study in the United States on a self-funded basis, is the son-in-law of a high-ranking official in the province. Because he did not meet the conditions for studying abroad, he sought help from many leaders multiple times. The Visa Office not only did not approve Li's application to go abroad but also repeatedly explained the country's policies and legal regulations to him.

Upholding principles and strictly implementing the Party's policies and laws sometimes also brings unexpected troubles. Over the 10 years since the Visa Office was established, relevant departments have received more than 10 reports accusing the office of "bribery" and "accepting gifts." The investigation results showed that none of the accusations were true. Most of the accusers were dissatisfied with the Visa Office's strict control over exits and filed complaints.

The Police Badge Shines in People's Hearts

Over the past 10 years, although the officers in this Visa Office have frequently changed, there has never been an incident of disciplinary or legal violations. Regarding this, the director, Weng Shancao, proudly said: "We have established a complete set of regulations, such as the document reception work system, approval system, certificate issuance system, seal and certificate management system, and reception system. The implementation of these regulations has made the visa work standardized and regulated. Additionally, we have established strict work discipline."

To ensure that the regulations and discipline are not just written on paper and posted on walls, the visa work is also managed by setting targets. The various regulations are broken down into the responsibilities of each officer, and a daily democratic evaluation is conducted using a percentage system. Because the regulations are comprehensive, there is both division of labor and cooperation and supervision, which ensures the quality of certificate issuance. Over the past 10 years, the Visa Office has reviewed and issued 4,182 passports for leaving the country, issued 8,347 exit certificates, received 30,000 visitors, and handled more than 8,000 letters, with no disciplinary violations.

The officers of the Visa Office are known for their integrity and have won the praise of the people. In recent years, they have received hundreds of letters of praise from all over the world. A overseas Chinese wrote: "From you, we see the image of the people's police of our motherland." The director of the Visa Office, Weng Shancao, was also awarded the title of Outstanding Communist Party Member by the Party Committee of the Directly Affiliated Units of Lake North Province.

　　维护法律尊严　不忘人民重托
    ——记湖北省公安厅签证科
    王齐生
    人称湖北省公安厅签证科是一道庄严的“国门”。在湖北省（除武汉地区外）凡因私出境的人，都要途经这道“国门”。
  “金钱买不到通行证”
    跨出国门，就需要“通行证”。
    江陵县文化馆职工钟秀华的父亲早年移居香港，家产丰厚，迫切希望钟秀华去港定居。钟秀华３次到当时主管签证科工作的副科长陈刚家送礼，都被一一退回。钟秀华想，他连礼都不收，出境申请肯定要退回。谁知没过几天，钟秀华收到被批准前往香港的证件，他激动不已。
    １９８７年５月，江汉油田职工黄某申请去港继承岳父的财产，因不符合条件，签证科未予办理。黄某便托人给陈刚带话：如果能批准他去港定居，愿送五位数的人民币。陈刚毫不客气地对带话人说：“请你转告他，在我们这里，金钱是买不到通行证的。”
    ３年来，全科７名干警共拒收钱物４０余次，折合人民币２．４万余元。
  不为私情所动
    汉川县王某原在郑州市工作，因申请自费留学未准，于１９８７年１１月扔下丈夫和孩子调到湖北汉川县，企图通过在汉川工作的父亲的“关系网”达到出国的目的。调到汉川县的第二个月，她就提出出国留学的申请，因不符合规定，又未被批准。于是，她动用关系网中的人为其说情。一时间，上下左右，亲朋故友，在位的和离职的，纷至沓来，或写条子，或打电话，或打招呼。面对这一切，签证科的干警丝毫也不为私情所动。
    申请到美国自费留学的李某，是省里一位高级干部的女婿，因不符合出国留学的条件，多次找一些领导同志帮他说情。签证科不但未批准李某出国，还反复对他讲国家的政策和法律规定。
    坚持原则，严格执行党的政策和法律，有时还会招来意外的麻烦。签证科组建１０年来，有关部门先后收到反映该科“受贿”、“收礼”的材料１０余件。调查结果无一属实。检举者中绝大多数是当事人对签证科严把出境关产生不满情绪而告状的。
  警徽在人们心中闪光
    １０年来，这个签证科的干警虽然常有变动，但从未发生过违纪违法的事。对此，科长翁山茅自豪地说：我们制定了一套完整的规章制度，如收件工作制度，审批制度，办证制度，发证制度，印章证件管理制度，接待制度等。这些制度的执行，使签证工作制度化，规范化。此外还制定了严明的工作纪律。
    为了不让制度和纪律写在纸上，贴在墙上，还对签证工作实行目标管理，把各项规章制度，分解成每个干部的职责，每日用百分制进行一次民主评议。由于制度健全，既有分工，又有协作和监督，从而保证了办证的质量。１０年来，签证科共审发出国护照４１８２件，发放出境证件８３４７本，接待上访人员３万余人次，处理来信８０００余封，未出现违反纪律的事。
    签证科的干警廉洁奉公，赢得了人们的称赞。近年来，他们收到从世界各地寄来的赞扬信数百封。一位迁居海外的侨胞写信说：“从你们身上，我们看到了祖国人民警察的形象”。签证科长翁山茅也被湖北省直属机关党委授予优秀共产党员称号。
