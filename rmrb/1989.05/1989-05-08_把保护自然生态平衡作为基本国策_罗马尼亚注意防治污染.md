Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 8th.

Romania regards the protection of nature and the maintenance of ecological balance as a fundamental state policy and has taken a series of effective measures to prevent and control environmental pollution.

In the current five-year plan (1986-1990), Romania's investment in environmental management has increased by 65% compared to the previous five-year plan. The country has established a network of automatic monitoring stations for environmental factors. These stations and laboratories measure the levels of pollution in the air, rivers, groundwater, and rainwater, as well as the radioactivity of other waste materials. This year, Romania will set up a network of 40 observation stations nationwide to conduct chemical tests on the ozone layer and the atmosphere.

Currently, Romania has nearly 10,000 sets of flue gas treatment equipment and 4,800 sets of sewage treatment facilities. However, these are insufficient to eliminate environmental pollution in large and medium-sized cities and industrial areas. Therefore, while improving these environmental protection facilities, the government is organizing manpower and resources to develop new equipment.

    罗马尼亚注意防治污染
    新华社布加勒斯特５月８日电  （记者周荣子、张汉文）罗马尼亚把保护自然、维护生态平衡作为一项基本国策，并采取了一系列防治环境污染的有效措施。
    在本５年计划期间（１９８６—１９９０年），罗治理环境的投资总额比上一个５年计划增长６５％。全国设置了环境因素自动监测网。各监测站和试验室对空气、河水、地下水和雨水的污染程度和其他废料放射性程度进行测定。今年罗将在全国４０个县设立对臭氧层、大气层进行化学测定的观测网。
    目前，罗全国有近１万套废气治理装置和４８００套污水处理设备，但对消除大中城市和工业区的环境污染仍显不足，因此，政府在改进这些环保设备的同时，正在组织人力物力，进行新设备的研制工作。
