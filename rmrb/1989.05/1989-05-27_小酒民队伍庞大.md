The army of young drinkers is vast. China currently has 160 million alcohol lovers, and behind them is an even larger reserve force—young drinkers.

A sampling survey by the Shenyang City Economic Investigation Team shows that among children aged 6 to 12, 60% drink alcohol. Among those who drink, 29% can consume one bottle or more of beer, champagne, or sparkling wine in one sitting. Currently, there are approximately 160 million children aged 6 to 12 nationwide. Even if we calculate based on 50%, there would still be 80 million young drinkers. If we include children aged 4 to 5 and 13 to 16, the number of young drinkers would be roughly equal to the number of adult drinkers. Among young drinkers, the ratio of males to females is about equal, which differs from the general trend where males outnumber females among adult drinkers.

Why are there so many children drinking alcohol? A survey of 311 children revealed three main reasons: First, parents spoil their children. For example, some parents drink alcohol themselves and also coax their children to drink. Second, environmental influence. Some families have alcohol stored in bookshelves, wine cabinets, and under beds. Out of curiosity, children take advantage of adults' inattention to steal champagne, beer, or wine to drink as beverages. Third, social influence. Nowadays, during weddings and funerals, alcohol is served, and children follow their parents to these events. Relatives persuade them to drink, turning many children from passive drinkers into active ones, eventually developing into "official drinkers."

### 小酒民队伍庞大

　　小酒民队伍庞大
    我国现有１．６亿嗜酒者，后面还跟着庞大的后备军——小酒民。
    沈阳市城市经济调查队的抽样调查表明：６—１２岁的儿童中，有６０％的人喝酒，一次能喝啤酒、香槟或汽酒等１瓶以上者占喝酒人数的２９％。现在全国约有６—１２岁的儿童１．６亿人，即使按５０％计算，小酒民也有８０００万人，如果加上４—５岁及１３—１６岁的，小酒民的数量和正式酒民差不多。在小酒民中，男女各半，这与一般酒民中男多女少是不相同的。
    为什么会有如此多的儿童喝酒呢？从抽样调查３１１名儿童的情况得知，主要原因有三：一是家长对孩子溺爱。比如有的家长自己喝酒时，也逗着孩子喝。二是受环境影响。有的家庭书橱、酒柜、床下到处放酒，孩子出于好奇，趁大人不备，就偷着拿出香槟、啤酒、葡萄酒等当饮料喝；三是社会影响。现在红白喜事都要摆个酒席，小孩们也跟着家长去，三姑劝二姨让，孩子们不喝也得喝，使许多儿童喝酒由被动转为主动，以至发展到现在成为“正式酒民”。
