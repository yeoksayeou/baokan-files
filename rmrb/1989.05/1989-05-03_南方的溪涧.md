    The streams of the south
    Beijing University Shangguan Fenghua

    Thorny brushwood guards the decaying grass,
    Salamanders nurture snakes and insects.
    The stream hides behind giant rocks, avoiding the cliffs,
    So weak that it seems lifeless.
    It knows nothing of the grandeur of the northern rivers,
    The ancient, desolate winding course.
    It winds around the ancestral tombs,
    Blurring the path to the ancestral graves.
    This stream
    Day after day, night after night,
    Lies silent, cold,
    Numbing a group of living beings,
    Eroding every bit of novelty.
    Who knows when
    A sudden clap of thunder will sound,
    And the mountain torrent, carrying yellow soil and stones,
    Will rush through the stream, trampling over it.
    Father stands alone in the face of nature's cruelty,
    Mouth wide open.
    When the stream returns to its silent death,
    People still drink from the stream's bounty,
    Father shouts,
    “I want to see the rivers of the north!”
    Father never made it to the north,
    But the son did.

　　南方的溪涧
    北京大学  上官风华
    荆榛护着烂草
    蛤蚧养着蛇虫
    溪涧躲着巨石避开悬崖
    羼弱得没有些许生机
    不知道北方大河的雄浑
    亘古苍凉的细弯流程
    绕过祖父坟地的拱木
    模糊了祖母上坟的小路
    这溪涧
    日复一日，夜复一夜
    寂静着，冷漠着
    麻木了一群群生灵
    销蚀了一丝丝新意　
    不知哪一天
    突然响了一声霹雳
    山洪夹着黄土沙石
    冲刷着在溪涧身上大踏步而过
    父亲兀立在自然的暴虐中
    张大了嘴巴
    当溪涧重归死寂
    人们依然享饮溪涧的施舍时
    父亲大喊
    “我要去看北方的河！”
    父亲究竟没有能够去成
    好在，儿子去成了
