The Chinese Association for the Study of the Yi Jing was recently established in Jinan. This is the first national organization in China dedicated to the study of the Yi Jing.

The Yi Jing is known as the "first of the Six Classics," the "source of the great way," and the "living water of the source." In modern times, the principles of this work, which is praised as the "greatest mathematics in the world," have spread widely in the international scientific community, inspiring many new ideas, technologies, and research topics. Four Nobel Prize winners have even said they have gained insights from the Yi Jing.

The newly established Chinese Association for the Study of the Yi Jing aims to unite scholars both domestically and internationally to conduct multi-level, multi-disciplinary research on the Yi Jing. The goal is to continuously explore new areas of Yi Jing research, comprehensively discuss the relationship between the Yi Jing and traditional culture, and elucidate the position and role of the Yi Jing in Chinese thought, culture, and scientific history.

The association elected the renowned scholar Zhang Daiyan as its honorary president and Tang Mingbang as its president. Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Zhou Guocheng and Chairman of the International Association for the Study of the Yi Jing Cheng Zhongying sent letters and telegrams of congratulations.
