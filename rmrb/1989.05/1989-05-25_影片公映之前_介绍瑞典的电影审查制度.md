The films "Red Sorghum," "Hibiscus Town," and "The King of Children" from China were recently screened in Sweden. The posters clearly stated that "Red Sorghum" is for audiences aged 15 and above, while "Hibiscus Town" and "The King of Children" are for audiences aged 7 and above. This is not a special treatment for Chinese films. Sweden classifies all films before they are publicly screened. The reporter interviewed Mrs. Gunilla Abec, the director of the Swedish National Film Censorship Bureau.

The office of this director, who holds the fate of films in her hands, is adorned with movie posters, reflecting her professional characteristics.

According to Mrs. Abec, Sweden has been implementing a film censorship system since 1911, making it one of the earliest countries in the world to do so. At that time, films had been in Sweden for many years, but management was chaotic, and a local police chief could ban a film. Under public pressure, the parliament passed the Film Censorship Act, stipulating that all films would be uniformly inspected and classified by the Film Censorship Bureau.

"The Film Censorship Act has a history of over seventy years. People's social concepts and lifestyles have changed greatly, so the classification standards have also been modified many times. Films that can be screened today might have been banned in the 1970s. However, the basic spirit of the main law is still valid. Any film that is screened without approval from the Censorship Bureau is illegal and will be fined," Mrs. Abec said.

"What standards do you use for classification?" the reporter asked.

"We mainly pay attention to whether the film incites people to seek violence, murder, and abuse for stimulation. If a film clearly violates the law in this way, it is absolutely banned. Additionally, we check whether the film causes psychological harm or abnormality to children. The political leanings, religious beliefs, styles, and quality of the film are not within the scope of censorship," she replied.

The Film Censorship Bureau classifies films into five categories: 1) for all audiences; 2) for audiences aged 7 and above; 3) for audiences aged 11 and above; 4) for audiences aged 15 and above; 5) banned. The film's category must be clearly indicated on the poster, advertisement, and ticket booth. Last year, they inspected 489 films, of which 31 were deemed to be banned, and 246 were classified as adult films.

Mrs. Abec admitted that censoring films is different from inspecting products in a factory and that there are no precise dividing lines. When they censor, they usually do not focus on the specific details of the film but rather on the overall effect. They observe how the theme of the film is developed and what kind of impact it might have on the audience. For example, if a narrative film includes some reasonable scenes of violence or love due to the plot or film style, the Censorship Bureau generally allows it to be screened but restricts it to adult audiences. However, if there are scenes that are unrelated to the plot and are used solely to stimulate the audience's senses, the Censorship Bureau will demand cuts. If the entire film is filled with brutal killings and debauched scenes of lust, it will be completely banned. The Censorship Bureau is cautious about films with relatively high artistic standards and generally does not demand cuts.

Mrs. Abec emphasized that the Censorship Bureau pays special attention to the impact of films on teenagers and children. A significant portion of the film audience is teenagers, and 95% of the films screened in Sweden are foreign. Some of these films might cause teenagers to develop psychological abnormalities, become cynical or emotionally detached, or even attempt violence, drug use, and indulge in pornography. For these films, the Censorship Bureau demands cuts or restricts them to adult audiences.

She mentioned that the Chinese film "Red Sorghum" is a film with a very high artistic standard. However, it contains a few terrifying scenes that children might find spiritually stimulating, so it was classified as an adult film.

They are very careful not to let young children get scared when classifying films. The Censorship Bureau pays special attention to avoiding scenes where parents abuse children, lock children in dark rooms, or kill pets that children like.

The Swedish government, in order to allow people to see more films that have both artistic value and good social effects, annually subsidizes over 100 million kronor to cinemas that screen "high-quality films." This fund is also allocated by the Film Censorship Bureau.

### 影片公映之前——介绍瑞典的电影审查制度

　　影片公映之前
    ——介绍瑞典的电影审查制度
    顾耀铭
    《红高粱》、《芙蓉镇》和《孩子王》等中国影片不久前在瑞典公映，海报上明白地写着《红高梁》仅供十五岁以上观众，《芙蓉镇》、《孩子王》供七岁以上观众。这不是对中国电影另眼相待。瑞典对所有公映的影片都要进行审查分类。记者为此采访了瑞典国家电影审查局局长古纳尔·阿贝克夫人。
    这位主宰影片命运的局长办公室里挂满了电影海报，显示了她的职业特色。
    据阿贝克夫人介绍，瑞典从一九一一年就开始实行电影审查制度，属于世界上最早实行电影审查的国家。当时电影在瑞典问世已有多年，但管理十分混乱，一名地方警察局长可以禁止一部影片的上演。在公众呼吁下议会通过了电影审查法，规定所有影片统一由电影审查局负责检查分类。
    “电影审查法已有七十多年历史，人们的社会概念和生活方式有了很大变化，因此在审查分类标准上也作了不少修改，今天可以公映的影片在七十年代可能禁演。但是这个主法的基本精神仍然有效，凡不经过审查局批准就公映电影是违法行为，要遭罚款惩处。”阿贝克夫人说。
    “你们的审查分类是按什么标准进行的？”记者问。
    “我们主要注意影片是否在诱导人们寻求暴力、凶杀及虐待等刺激，如果属这类明显违反法律的影片是绝对禁演的，此外我们要检查影片是否使儿童造成精神损伤或心理变态。至于影片的政治倾向、宗教信仰以及风格、质量等不属于审查范畴。”
    电影审查局把影片分为五类：一、供所有观众；二、七岁以上；三、十一岁以上；四、十五岁以上；五、禁演。电影的类别在海报、广告和售票处都要有明确的表示。去年他们共检查了四百八十九部影片，其中三十一部被认为应当禁演，二百四十六部定为成人影片。
    阿贝克夫人承认审查影片不同于工厂检查产品，没有精确的划分界线。他们在审查时，通常不是注意影片的具体细节，而是重视影片总的效果，观察影片的主题以何种形式展开，它对观众可能产生什么样的影响。如一部故事片由于情节或影片风格的需要出现一些合乎情理的暴力或性爱镜头，审查局一般都允许公映，但限于成年人观看。但如果出现同故事情节毫无关系只是为了作为一种噱头刺激观众的感官的镜头，审查局就要提出删剪。如果整部影片充满着残忍的凶杀和荒荡的淫乱场面，就要完全禁演。审查局对一些艺术水准比较高的影片持慎重态度，一般不提出删剪。
    阿贝克夫人强调审查局特别注意影片对青少年和儿童的影响。电影观众中相当部分是青少年，在瑞典公映的影片百分之九十五是外国影片，其中有一部分影片，青少年看后可能会产生心理变态，变得玩世不恭或者感情冷漠，甚至去尝试暴力、吸毒和沉溺于色情。对这部分影片，审查局要求删剪或者限制于成年观众。
    她谈到，中国电影《红高梁》是一部艺术水准很高的影片，只是其中有几个恐怖镜头孩子看了会受精神刺激，因此被定为成人影片。
    他们在给影片分类时很注意不要让幼童受惊吓。审查局很注意避免使幼童看到影片中出现父母虐待儿童，把孩子关在黑屋子里或者将孩子喜欢的小动物杀戮等镜头。
    瑞典政府为了使人们能看到更多既有艺术水平，又有较好社会效果的电影，每年对上演“高质量影片”的电影院共资助一百多万克朗。这笔资金也是由电影审查局负责分配的。
