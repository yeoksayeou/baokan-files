    Be Cautious When Boarding Here
    On the afternoon of March 12, I boarded the 214th train from Wuhan to Qingdao at Zhengzhou Railway Station to go to Zibo, Shandong. The time for the train to depart had arrived, but the gate to the platform was still locked. Passengers shouted loudly to open the gate and let them in, but the station staff remained unmoved. Some passengers then entered the station from the 5th waiting room. At this moment, the main gate opened, and dozens of police officers rushed in, shouting, "All of you, get out!" Due to the large number of passengers and the chaotic order, two workers in blue uniforms and holding walkie-talkies waved wooden sticks at the passengers. At that time, a soldier's forehead was hit and blood flowed down his face, and dozens of passengers also received blows to their shoulders. Such a way of maintaining order at the station is indeed rare.

    I managed to squeeze into the platform with the crowd. Just as I was about to board the train, a female attendant wearing a "Qing 04" badge and a male security officer wearing a "Jizhou Qingduan 64" badge both demanded cigarettes from me. I took out a pack of Xiangyang brand cigarettes, and they said, "What kind of cigarettes are these? Give us 10 yuan!" I didn't have time to think and handed over 10 yuan, only then was I able to board the train. I never thought that I would encounter such a thing at Zhengzhou Station.

　　在此乘车要当心
    ３月１２日下午，我在郑州火车站乘武昌至青岛２１４次列车去山东淄博。眼看开车时间已到，可进站口的铁门还锁着，旅客们大声喊开门放人进站，但车站工作人员无动于衷。一些旅客便从５号候车室进入站内。这时，进站口的大门打开了，几十名民警蜂拥而至，大声喊道：“你们都退出去！”由于旅客人多，秩序乱，两个身着蓝制服、手持步话机的工作人员气势汹汹地举起木棍向旅客挥舞而来。当时有一名军人的额头被打破，血流满面，几十名旅客的肩膀也挨了几棍。像这样维持车站秩序，确实少见。
    我随着人群好不容易挤进站台。正要上车时，一个佩戴“青列０４”号证章的女乘务员和戴着“济局青段６４”号证章的男乘警竟同时向我索要香烟。我掏出一包襄阳牌香烟，他们一看说：“这算啥烟？拿１０块钱来！”我来不及多考虑递过去１０块钱，才上了车。真没想到，在郑州车站会遇到这样的事。
