Title: The Urgent Need to Regulate Video Publishing

If we say that before 1988, the main forms of audiovisual art were films and television dramas, which often competed in terms of subject matter, then since 1988, another "dragon" has emerged between these two—video publishing. According to statistics from relevant departments, in just over a year, the number of video and audio publishing units approved by the state has exceeded 160. However, people are not without concern as they observe that, with the transformation of the country's product economy into a commodity economy, the economic benefits have constrained the video publishing industry, leading to a chaotic situation that urgently needs regulation.

Without even considering whether China's current economic strength can support the sudden establishment of over 160 video publishing units, or whether it is a distorted form of cultural consumption for a developing country like China, which has underdeveloped communications and transportation, to suddenly see such a large number of video publishing units, a calm analysis of the ideological and artistic quality of the 300,000 or so video tapes already published and their impact on socialist spiritual civilization reveals a worrying situation. It is reported that for every video tape sold, approximately 50 yuan can be earned. This means that if a certain video tape is circulated in batches of 2,000, it can earn 100,000 yuan. Thus, among the more than 600 types of domestically produced video tapes that have been circulated, such as "Taiwan Black Cat Inn" published by Yangzi River Audio-Visual Publishing Company, has circulated tens of thousands of copies; "Son, Father, Knife" published by Hunan Jinfeng Audio-Visual Company has also circulated thousands of copies. Although these two video tapes can be considered among the best in terms of quality among those published recently, their actual ideological and artistic levels are still far from satisfactory. Moreover, the more than 50,000 video playback points scattered across cities and towns nationwide, nearly 10,000 institutions, factories, hotels, and other places with closed-circuit television systems, as well as the approximately 4 million home video players, mostly play imported overseas video tapes. Although there are only about 300 types of these imported overseas video tapes, their total circulation is twice that of domestic video tapes. Whether imported or domestically produced, the content of these video tapes is mostly detective, crime, murder, romance, martial arts, and dance. As for the low-quality overseas pornographic video tapes that have entered the country through smuggling due to lax management, and the shoddy domestic video tapes published illegally, it can be said that their impact on the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the healthy growth of young people is negative.

This poses a serious question for us: video publishing and screening urgently need rectification and regulation. Since we acknowledge that in the long-term cultural tradition and appreciation activities, there are indeed negative factors in the public's aesthetic habits and tastes that are at odds with modernization and need to be transformed and improved, and since we see that the main audience for video tapes are the "floating population" and young people across cities and towns, the work of rectification and regulation is even more urgent. Otherwise, if we allow video publishing and screening to merely cater to the negative and backward elements in the public's aesthetic emotions, it will inevitably strengthen these negative and backward elements, which in turn will stimulate the production of video tapes with even lower standards. We hope that all parties will make efforts to guide the healthy development of the video publishing industry and attract the attention of the whole society, especially the theoretical criticism community.

　　录像出版亟待治理
    仲呈祥
    如果说，１９８８年以前，视听艺术中主要还是电影与电视剧这两“龙”在题材选择上常常相争的话；那么，１９８８年以来，两“龙”之间，又腾起一“龙”——录像出版。据有关部门统计，仅一年多来，全国经国家正式批准成立的录音录像出版单位，已超过１６０家。然而，人们不无忧虑地看到，伴随着整个国家产品经济向商品经济转型，经济效益对录像出版事业的制约，使全国急剧发展起来的录像生产呈现出亟待治理的混乱局面。
    且不论我国当今的经济实力是否承受得起这一窝蜂办起来的１６０余家录像出版单位，也不论像我国这样一个通讯、交通都尚不发达的发展中的国家一下子铺天盖地地出现如许录像出版单位是不是一种畸形的超前文化消费，只消冷静地分析一下迄今为止已出版的３０余万盒录像带的思想艺术质量及其在社会主义精神文明中产生的作用，情况便不能不令人感到忧虑。据悉，每销售一盒录像带，大约可赢利５０元。这就是说，某种录像带只要发行上两千盒，即可赢利１０万元。于是，在已发行的６００多种国产录像带中，像扬子江音像出版公司出版的《台湾黑猫旅社》，就发行了上万盒；湖南金峰音像公司出版的《儿子·老子·刀子》，也发行了数千盒。尽管这两种录像带已称得上是时下出版的录像带中质量上乘者，但实际上的思想艺术水平也还远远不尽如人意。而遍布全国城乡的５万多个录像放映点，近万个办有闭路电视系统的机关、厂矿、宾馆，以及４００万部左右的进入家庭的私用录像机所播放的录像带，大多是进口出版的海外录像带。这种进口出版的海外录像带虽然只有３００多种，但总发行量却是国产录像带的２倍。无论是进口的还是国产的录像带，内容上皆属侦破、警匪、情杀、爱情、武打、歌舞之类。至于还有由于管理不严靠走私流入的格调低下的海外色情录像带和国内非法出版的粗制滥造的劣品在暗中传播，可以说，对于社会主义精神文明的建设和青少年的健康成长，其作用是消极的。
    这就向我们严峻地提出了一个问题：录像出版、放映，亟待整顿、治理。既然我们承认在长期的文化传统和鉴赏活动中积淀形成的大众审美习惯和趣味中，确实还存在着有悖于现代化的亟待改造和提高的消极因素，既然我们看到录像带的观众层主要是遍及城乡的“盲流”人员和广大青少年，那么，这种整顿、治理的工作就更显得迫在眉睫。否则，容忍录像出版、放映一味迎合大众审美情绪中的消极落后因素，就势必令这种消极落后因素得到强化，其结果又会反过来刺激格调更为低下的录像带的生产。我们期望各方面作出努力，导引录像出版事业的健康发展和吸引全社会特别是理论批评界的关注。
