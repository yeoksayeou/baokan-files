I finally had the chance to visit Huangshan, but unfortunately, it rained and was foggy for the two days I was there. The stunning scenery was just out of reach, a few meters away. The day after I descended the mountain, the rain stopped and the sky cleared. That was when Huangshan was at its most beautiful. As soon as I got down the mountain, I regretted not staying an extra day. But then I regretted going up the mountain at all. It was during those two days that Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away. I only found out from a local newspaper a few days later. On the day of the memorial service, I listened to the live broadcast on the train, but the volume was very low, and I couldn't feel the sorrow in the Great Hall of the People or on the square. When my colleagues talked to me about the grandeur and passion of those days, I could only shake my head and say, "I missed it..."

This regret is personal and insignificant. I suddenly thought that the people on the square that day might be even more regretful. When they did not see the figure they had been hoping for, they cried. That unseen figure should be even more regretful. That still robust figure, if it could have accepted the fervent gazes of tens of millions of young people, would have shone brilliantly. Otherwise, it would fade away.

If three days later, a reasonable wish was not hastily and arbitrarily covered with a hat that hides its true face, that figure would still have a chance to shine. There would not have been hundreds of thousands of people on the streets of Beijing. If after that, there could be a sincere dialogue with a true representative, that figure would stand with the people, not as an opponent, commemorating the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement for democracy and freedom.

Communism is the ultimate goal of humanity, and I still believe in it. However, like most Chinese people, I need a specific image to embody this ideal. I hope that image will come among us, breathe the same air, and bask in the same sunlight on the square. A real person should not be afraid of the sunlight. In the ten days after May 4th, I came to the square, squeezed among hundreds of thousands of people. I heard this roaring wish and seemed to see a sincere representative come to erect a trustworthy image for the people. But when I returned at five in the morning, filled with melancholy, I understood the frustration of the hundreds of thousands of young people. It was actually a deep sadness, like a child abandoned by its mother.

The children have grown up, but they still hope that their mother will lead the way, and they will follow closely. They need to have a heart-to-heart talk with their mother. Thousands of people endured hunger and thirst, even sacrificing their lives, and hundreds of thousands of people endured the scorching sun, all for this opportunity. Is this opportunity so hard to come by? There is still only cold indifference from the sky, and seemingly warm words that turn into cold print. The opportunity was missed again and again...

Our Party has been tirelessly striving to establish a clean and glorious image. But the opportunities for the ordinary to become great and the mundane to become glorious are often pursued intentionally but obtained by chance, fleeting. Our country, our nation, and our Party have missed many opportunities. This time, we cannot afford to lose it. Perhaps, to give the children some comfort, their true parents also came to the square, to be by their side. Those facing the danger of being abandoned are no longer the children, but the idols in their hearts.

I often dream of the steep peaks and towering pines of Huangshan. How I wish I could truly be there. Will there be another chance...?

　　错过了……
    碧森
    好容易有了个机会上黄山，可惜在山上两天都雨雾迷蒙，峻美的风光被挡在目光所及的数尺之外。下山的第二天就雨过天晴了，那时黄山最美。下了山就后悔，为什么不多停留一天呢？但接着又后悔，不该上这趟山，正是在那两天，胡耀邦同志逝世了，我几天后方从地方报纸上见到消息。追悼会那天就在列车上听实况转播，可惜声音极低，感受不到大会堂内和广场上的悲戚。当同事对我谈起那几日来的壮观和激情，我只有摇摇头，说一声：“错过了……”
    这种遗憾毕竟是个人的，微不足道。我忽然想那天在广场上的人可能比我更遗憾，当他们未能见到所盼望的身影时，他们哭了。那未出现的身影应当更遗憾，那还算魁梧的身影，倘若能接受几十万双青春炽热的目光，将会辉煌起来，否则变得暗淡。
    如果三天后不匆匆忙忙地给一个合理的愿望扣上遮住真颜的帽子，那身影还有机会辉煌，也就不会有北京街头的几十万人。如果在这之后能有一个真诚的代表对话，那身影将和人民一道而不是作为对立面，纪念为争民主自由的“五·四”运动七十周年。
    共产主义是人类的终极目标，我仍坚信着。不过我也像大多数中国人一样，心中需要一个具体的形象来附丽理想，希望那形象走到我们中间来，在广场上一起呼吸空气，一起沐浴阳光。真实的人不应当害怕阳光。五月四日过后的十天，我来到广场，挤在几十万人流中，我听到了这呼啸的愿望，也似乎看到有一个真诚的代表来为人们竖起可信的形象。但当我在凌晨五点惆怅而归时，我理解了几十万青年人的愤懑，那其实是一种深刻的悲哀，像被母亲抛弃了的孩子。
    孩子已经大了，但仍盼望母亲走在他们前头，他们会紧紧追随。他们需要和母亲亲切交谈，几千人忍饥受渴以至用生命为代价，几十万人在骄阳下烤晒，就为了这么一个机会。这机会就这么难得吗？仍然只有冷漠从空中飘来，依然只有看似热情的话语变成铅字而显得冷冰冰。机会一次次错过了……
    我们的党一直在为树立廉洁光辉的形象而作不懈努力。但平凡变伟大，平淡变辉煌的机会很多是刻意追求而偶然得之的，稍纵即逝。我们的国家，我们的民族，我们的党已经贻误了多次时机，这一次不能再失去了。或许为了给孩子们一点慰藉，他们真正的生身母亲和父亲也来到广场，来到他们身边。面临被抛弃危险的，已不是孩子，而是他们心目中的偶像。
    我不时梦到黄山的险峰、劲松，我多愿意有机会真正置身其中。这机会还有吗？……
