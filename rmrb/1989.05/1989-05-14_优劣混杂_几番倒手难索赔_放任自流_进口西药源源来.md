	Mixed Quality, Difficult to Claim Compensation After Multiple Transfers
	Unrestricted Imports, Western Drugs Flowing In

	It is reported that from 1984 to the present, the Shanghai Municipal Drug Inspection Institute has identified substandard imported drugs worth 6 million US dollars, accounting for nearly one-quarter of all imported drugs. In addition, regions such as East China and North China also import large quantities of Western drugs through the Shanghai port. A company in Jiangxi imported 1,500 kilograms of amoxicillin from Italy, which was then resold at a higher price to a company in Inner Mongolia. The latter, without even examining the samples, resold it at an even higher price to a pharmaceutical factory in Zhangjiakou, Hebei. When the factory attempted to take delivery, they discovered quality issues, but by then, the compensation period had expired.

	Importing Western drugs or raw materials as a supplement to China's pharmaceutical industry and market is necessary. However, in recent years, with the increase in local foreign exchange retention, the trend of importing Western drug raw materials for domestic processing has become increasingly strong, with import volumes rising year by year. At the same time, due to lax management, the proportion of substandard drugs among imported drugs has also been increasing annually. For the export of domestically produced drugs, the state has clear regulations for unified dispatch by the medical protection company, but for imported drugs, the situation is one of laissez-faire, leading to many substandard products entering

　　优劣混杂　几番倒手难索赔    
    放任自流　进口西药源源来
    又讯  据上海市药检所透露，１９８４年至今，他们验出的劣质进口药价值达６００万美元，占全部进口药的１／４强。此外，华东、华北等地也都通过上海口岸在大批进口西药。江西一家公司从意大利进口的１５００公斤氨卡青霉素，转手就加价卖给了内蒙古一公司，而后者连样品都未看，又加价卖给河北省张家口的药厂。厂里欲取货时才报批报检，结果发现质量有问题，可这时规定的索赔期已过。
    进口西药成品或原料，作为对我国医药工业和市场的一种补充，是必要的。但是，近年来，随着各地自留外汇的增多，利润颇丰的进口西药原料国内加工的势头越来越猛，进口量逐年增加。同时，因管理松弛，进口药中劣质品的比例也在逐年上升。对国产药品的出口，国家明文规定由医保公司统一调度，而对进口药品，却呈放任自流状况，因而导致许多劣质品混入国内，再加上中间倒手次数多，最后即使发现，也无法向国外索赔，给国家造成巨大损失。　（尚时）
