If we say that it was only in 1988 that novelists were shocked to discover that novels were losing their sensational impact, then poets had already tasted this bitter pill by 1986.

After two years of aftershocks, or even a kind of struggle, poets finally calmed down. Most poets no longer expect to showcase their prowess through their poetry and have weighed the value and significance of their own role in society.

This adjustment is very necessary. On one hand, it has corrected the relationship between poets and society, and on the other hand, it has clarified society's demands on poets. This has allowed poetry to gradually harmonize with our society of reform and opening up, and to gradually move from non-poetry towards poetry, towards its artistic essence. I feel that 1988 was the year when the poetry world basically completed its self-adjustment.

From this perspective, this year was ordinary, but it was not insignificant.

Firstly, although poets are adjusting their positions, it does not mean that poets have lost their passion for social issues. Instead, they are better at considering how to express their feelings from a poetic perspective and how to better choose their subjects. For example, "After the Great Calamity - China's Reflection" (Wei Shui) reflects on the Great Khingan Fire and touches on the entire social transformation; "1987: Bureaucratism in China" (Xiong Zhaozheng) exposes social problems from multiple angles; "I Sit in the Audience" (Zhang Zhiming) expresses the yearning for democratic spirit from the Fifth National People's Congress; "Speculators" (Wang Hao) depicts a complex phenomenon in the reform; "China, the Traffic-Jammed China" (Jian Ying) describes the reality of reform with a mix of joy and sorrow; Ye Yanbin's autobiographical poetry writes about social life from his own experiences; Cheng Xiaobei's documentary poem "Seven Thousand Miles of Bicycle in Wind and Rain" observes the overlooked aspects of life with ordinary people's eyes; and so on. These poems are still attracting readers' attention, with their fresh topics and strong social news value still exuding considerable charm. Of course, these poems also cannot cause a "sensation," but poets do not give up their responsibility just because they are "not sensational." It can also be seen that, due to the adjustment, poets' self-awareness has increased, and writing socially-oriented poems is not just singing the same social tune, but is filled with unique personal consciousness. This way, the artistic effect is obviously enhanced.

Some poets have abandoned the direct expression of social issues, although a certain state of agitation in their hearts makes it difficult for them to remain calm, but from the selection of poetic subjects or themes, one cannot immediately see their deep meaning. It can be seen that this adjustment has made some poets' brushstrokes more powerful. Sun Jingxuan's "Black" and "There Are No Women Here" are both extraordinary, especially the latter, which opens up a new path by choosing a side of life and raising a major social theme; Lu Yuan's long poem "High-Speed Night Travel" uses a surreal-like method to write about the contemporary, which is very readable; Shao Yanxiang's "The Last Monologue" is noteworthy in terms of subject matter, conception, and the combination of emotion and philosophy; Ke Ping's "Poet Mao Zedong" is handled with elegance and dignity; Zhou Jingzhi's "On AIDS" dares to touch on major global concerns but does not lose its humorous touch.

On the other hand, more poets have turned the themes of their poetry towards universal life, towards nature and love, towards the subtle relationships between people. Thus, they have discovered a particularly vast realm. Here, they have found full emotional expression, and they have also sought philosophical reflection on life. In this way, artistic lyric poetry has developed extraordinarily. Some middle-aged and young poets like Gong Xie, Han Zuorong, Yi Le, and Zhai Yongming have published many excellent lyric poems. Fu Tianlin's lyric long poem "The Sea" also has considerable weight. These lyric poems, which are dazzling to the eyes, have already overwhelmed the critics, so they are being submerged wave after wave. However, if a few collections of lyric poems are selected from this year, it would be effortless. Due to the improvement of the artistic nature of lyric poetry, _Poetry Magazine_ in 1988 placed short lyric poems in the prominent headline position three times, which was praised by readers. Of course, lyric poetry also has the risk of becoming too prevalent.

Poets entering a state of tranquility is a necessity for the art of poetry. In 1988, there were far fewer people raising flags and forming factions. If this "tranquility" continues, Chinese poetry art may make some real progress.

Just as our social life is implementing a dual-track system, the agitation and tranquility of poets are also inevitable. Both socially-oriented and non-socially-oriented poetry will seek artistic perfection along their own tracks.

　　双轨：躁动和沉静
    刘湛秋
    如果说直到１９８８年小说家才震惊地发现小说正在失去轰动效应的话，那么诗人早在１９８６年就尝够这枚橄榄果了。
    经过两年的余波，甚至可以说是某种挣扎，诗人终于冷静下来了。大多数诗人已不指望用自己的诗去展示多大的雄风，也掂量出了自己在整个社会中的价值和分量。
    这种调整是非常必要的。一是摆正了诗人和社会的关系，一是明确了社会对诗人的要求。这就使诗歌逐渐和我们改革开放的社会协调起来，使诗歌逐渐从非诗歌走向诗歌、走向它的艺术自身。我感觉，１９８８年是诗歌界基本完成自我调整的一年。
    从这个角度看，这一年是平凡的，但又不是无足轻重的。
    首先，虽然诗人自我调整位置，并不等于诗人失去对社会问题的热情，而是更善于从诗的角度去考虑如何表现自己的感受，如何更好地选择题材。像《大难之后——中国的沉思》（渭水）从对大兴安岭火灾的反思触及到整个社会的变革；《１９８７：官僚主义在中国》（熊召政）多侧面揭露社会问题；《我坐在观众席上》（张志民）从五届人大写对民主精神的渴求；《倒爷》（王浩）表现改革中的一个复杂现象；《中国，堵车的中国》（健鹰）喜忧参半地去描写改革中的现实；叶延滨的自传体的诗，从自己的经历去写社会生活；程小蓓的纪实诗《自行车风雨七千里》用普通人的眼睛去审视不为人注意的生活侧面；等等。这些诗依然受到读者关注，它以其新颖的题材、强烈的社会新闻性依然散发出相当的魅力。当然，这些诗也并不能引起“轰动”，但诗人也并不因为“不轰动”而放弃责任。另外也可以看出，由于进行了调整，诗人自我意识增强，写社会性的诗并非唱一个相同的社会性音调，而是充满了独特的个人意识。这样，就明显增强了其艺术效果。
    还有些诗人对社会问题放弃直率表露的做法，虽然某种躁动状态在他们内心中使他们难于平静，但从诗的选材或题目上不能一眼就看出其深意。可以看出，这种调整使一些诗人的笔触更富有力度。孙静轩的《黑色》和《这里没有女人》都写得不同一般，尤其是后者独辟蹊径，选择了一个生活侧面，提出了重大的社会主题；绿原的长诗《高速夜行车》用类似超现实的手法写当代，很耐读；邵燕祥的《最后的独白》从选材、构思到抒情与哲理的结合方面都是引人注目的；柯平的《诗人毛泽东》，处理得潇洒而庄重；邹静之的《关于艾滋病》敢于触及全球关心的重大问题，但又不失其幽默笔触。
    另一方面，更多的诗人把诗的主题转向普遍的人生，转向大自然和爱情，转向人与人之间的微妙关系。于是，他们发现了一大片特别广阔的天地。在这里，他们得到了感情的充分发泄，他们也寻求到了人生哲理的思索。这样，艺术性的抒情诗得到了异常的发展。一些中青年诗人像宫玺、韩作荣、伊蕾、翟永明等发表了很多优秀的抒情诗。傅天琳的抒情长诗《海》也有相当的分量。这些使人目不暇接的抒情诗的花园已令评论家无从掇拾，所以反倒一浪一浪地被淹没。但是，如果从这一年度里选出几本抒情诗集，是轻而易举的。由于抒情诗的艺术性提高，因而，《诗刊》在１９８８年内三次把短抒情诗放在头条的显著位置，受到读者称赞。当然，抒情诗也有泛滥之虞。
    诗人进入沉静，是诗的艺术的需要。１９８８年，扯旗拉派的也少多了。如此“沉静”下去，中国的诗歌艺术也可能会有些真正的长进。
    正如我国社会生活在实行双轨制一样，诗人的躁动和沉静也是必然的，社会性和非社会性的诗都会沿着自己的轨道去寻求艺术的极境。
