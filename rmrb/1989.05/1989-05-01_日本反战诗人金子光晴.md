Kaneko Mitsuharu (1895–1975) was a renowned modern Japanese poet of the Symbolist school. He was born into a rural family that owned a liquor business and attended but did not graduate from the Tokyo School of Fine Arts, Waseda University, and Keio University's School of Letters.

Kaneko began his poetry career in 1915 and co-founded the journals *Konchūku* and *Tamashii no Ie* with friends. In 1919, he published his debut poetry collection *Akatsuchi no Ie*, which had strong proletarian characteristics. From 1919 to 1921, he traveled through France and Belgium, where he encountered the poetry of Baudelaire, Verhaeren, and Gautier, among others, and was significantly influenced by Symbolism and Parnassianism. In 1923, he published the poetry collection *Kame-mushi*, which established his reputation with its ornate French Symbolist style. He later visited Shanghai twice. For a considerable period, he retreated from the literary scene's debates between proletarian literature and modernist literature. From 1929 to 1937, he wandered through Southeast Asia and Europe. Upon his return to Japan, he used symbolic methods to write the poetry collection *Same* (1937), which fiercely criticized Japanese militarism, causing a stir in the literary world. During World War II, he continued his poetry, especially after witnessing the Japanese military's invasion in Northeast China, he developed a firm anti-war conviction. Post-war, he published several poetry collections expressing anti-war sentiments, such as *Parachute*, *Moth*, and *The Song of the Enemy*, which had a significant impact. He once said, "I believe that only resistance is life, only resistance can survive, and only resistance can grasp the self." His other major poetry collections include *Human Tragedy*, *Few Emotions*, and *Water Flow*, and he has won various literary awards in Japan multiple times.

Kaneko's poetry is highly symbolic, skillfully employing unusual metaphors and biting satire. He excels in refining poetic forms, using concise language, and emphasizing emotional expression, making his abstract works thought-provoking. Unlike other poets of his school, he was bold in criticizing social ills, using a strong sense of justice to denounce imperialist aggression and the oppression of colonial peoples and domestic citizens. As a courageous anti-war poet, his works are a unique flower in Japanese modern anti-war progressive literature.

　　日本反战诗人金子光晴
    黎华
    金子光晴（１８９５—１９７５），日本现代著名的象征派诗人。他出身于一个乡村酒商家庭，在东京美术学校、早稻田大学和庆应义塾大学文科肄业。
    金子光晴从１９１５年开始诗歌创作，曾和友人创办《构图》、《魂之家》刊物。１９１９年出版处女诗集《红土的家园》，带有浓厚的民众派色彩。１９１９至１９２１年间流浪法国、比利时，接触波特莱尔、维尔哈伦、戈蒂埃等诗歌，受到象征派和帕尔纳斯派较大的影响。１９２３年出版诗集《金龟子》，以华丽的法国象征主义诗风登上诗坛。其后两度游访我国上海。此后，在一段较长的时间内，他对文坛上无产阶级文学和现代派文学之争落寞隐退，１９２９至１９３７年间先后漂泊东南亚和欧洲，回国后，以象征的手法，写出了猛烈抨击日本军国主义统治的诗集《鲨鱼》（１９３７），使诗坛为之哗然。第二次世界大战期间坚持诗歌创作，特别在赴我国东北目睹日军侵略后树立了坚定的反战信念。战后相继出版表现反战情绪的诗集《降落伞》、《蛾》、《鬼子之歌》等，影响很大。他曾说：“我相信，只有反抗才是人生，只有反抗才能生存，只有反抗才能把握自我。”他的主要诗集还有《人间悲剧》、《寡情》和《水势》等，并多次获得日本的各种文学奖。
    金子光晴的诗象征性较强，善于运用奇特的比喻、辛辣的讽刺，在诗体的锤炼上独具匠心，语言简洁，重视感情色彩的渲染，虽然抽象却耐人寻味。另外，他与同流派诗人的相异之处是勇于针砭时弊，以极大的正义感抨击帝国主义的侵略和对殖民地以及国内人民的压迫。他作为勇敢的反战诗人名闻遐迩，他的作品是日本现代反战进步文学中的一支奇葩。
