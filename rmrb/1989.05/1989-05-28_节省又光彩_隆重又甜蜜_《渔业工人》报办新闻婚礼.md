Currently, extravagant weddings have become a social nuisance. Many people, constrained by traditional customs and the pressure to keep up with neighbors, feel compelled to go along with the trend.

The *Fishermen's Daily* of the Dalian Fisheries Company has drawn inspiration from overseas advertising wedding formats and started a news wedding service in April. The service involves sending reporters to interview the newlyweds, taking wedding photos, and publishing these along with greetings from leaders and family members in a dedicated column. Additionally, the service aims to assist participating employees, especially crew members, in any way possible.

The *Fishermen's Daily* has been actively promoting this initiative, encouraging more couples to opt for a thrifty yet splendid, grand yet sweet wedding. This approach not only reduces financial burdens but also sets a positive example for society.

　　节省又光彩　隆重又甜蜜
    《渔业工人》报办新闻婚礼
    本报讯  当前，婚事大操大办已成为社会公害，许多人碍于习惯势力和邻里攀比压力，不得已而为之。
    大连渔业公司的《渔业工人》报借鉴国外广告婚礼形式，从４月份开始创办新闻婚礼业务。其具体内容是，接到职工申请后，派记者采访新人，拍摄新婚照片，连同领导和亲人的贺词一并辟栏刊登。同时，力所能及地为参加新闻婚礼的职工（重点是船员）办好事。
