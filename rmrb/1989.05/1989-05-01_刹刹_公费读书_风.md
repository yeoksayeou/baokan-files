A piece of information: A certain unit organized a study class, training 400 affiliated cadres, with a planned expenditure of 300,000 yuan.

Another piece of information: A certain unit organized 800-plus affiliated cadres to study in shifts for three weeks in a training class format, with a planned expenditure of 1,000,000 yuan.

Yet another piece of information: To encourage cadres to study diligently in the study class, a leading comrade revealed to everyone: "The public spends about 60 yuan per person per day for your accommodation, meals, and other expenses. This is the blood and sweat of the working people. If we do not study hard, we will be letting the people down."

According to both published and unpublished accurate news, a trend of "publicly funded study" has suddenly risen again.

The reason I use the word "again" is that the trend of "publicly funded study" was quite prevalent during the Cultural Revolution. At that time, various "study classes" and "reading classes" were organized frequently. Almost all leaders had to take turns attending these classes to study. The classes particularly emphasized the concentration of personnel, time, and energy, and paid great attention to creating "good learning conditions." Therefore, they were usually held in guesthouses or hotels. With public funds as a backing, the food was good, the accommodation was good, and there was also entertainment during leisure time. At that time, I was working in a grassroots political organ doing propaganda and reporting work. One of our leaders went to a class organized by a higher authority to study "Anti-Dühring." He studied for 20 days and gained several pounds. Before the class ended, the study class required each student to write a big-character poster article. Thus, my colleague and I were called to the guesthouse where the study class was held to help him write the big-character poster. Neither of us had read the book, so we found the book and worked through the night to produce a big-character poster. The next day, this poster was praised in a small group meeting and was even recommended to be read at the study class's general meeting... From that time on, I have been skeptical about spending a lot of money to organize study classes. Of course, we cannot equate some of the current study classes with the "study classes" during the Cultural Revolution.

Reading and studying is a good thing, especially in the current situation of rectification and deepening reform, it is urgent to improve the ideological and theoretical level of all cadres. It is also appropriate to let cadres take turns to leave their heavy daily work so that they can concentrate time and energy to read some books. However, does creating good learning conditions necessarily mean concentrating people together and having the public pay for accommodation and meals? I don't think so. Moreover, does having the public pay for accommodation and meals and providing various "good conditions" necessarily mean that one can study well? I don't think so either. With public funds, spending dozens of yuan per person per day, such a "study class" not only fails to study hard and lets the people down, but even if one studies hard, it is still a waste of the people's money.

In fact, there are many ways to organize learning. For example, participants can be asked to leave their workstations for a specified period, be assigned reading materials, and given some questions to answer. When there are lectures or discussions, they can be gathered together, and the rest of the time can be arranged by individuals. In this way, they can eat and live at their own homes, and as long as they are strictly required, good results can still be achieved. More importantly, it is necessary to cultivate the habit of reading in daily life, which is the fundamental measure.

The trend of "publicly funded study" is similar to publicly funded tourism and publicly funded banquets and gifts, and should also be curbed. While some planned study classes have not yet been organized and some planned public funds have not yet been spent, it is not too late to curb this trend of "publicly funded study."

### 刹刹“公费读书”风

　　刹刹“公费读书”风
    沙莎
    信息之一：某单位组织读书班，集训所属干部４００人，计划支出３０万元。
    信息之二：某单位组织所属干部８００余人以轮训班形式分期分批脱产读书３周，计划支出１００万元。
    信息之三：为勉励干部们在读书班认真读书学习，一位领导同志向大家交了底：“公家每天要为你们每人报销住宿费、伙食费和其它费用共计６０元左右。这是劳动人民的血汗，我们如果不好好学习，就对不起人民。”
    据见诸报端的和未见诸报端的确切消息，一股“公费读书”风又骤然吹起。
    我这里所以用了个“又”字，是因为“公费读书”风在“文革”中曾经很刮过一阵子。那时候，各种“学习班”、“读书班”办得十分频繁，大凡头头脑脑都要轮番进班读书学习。办班特别强调人员、时间、精力“三集中”，十分重视创造“良好的学习条件”，所以一般办在招待所或宾馆里。有公费做后盾，吃得好，住得好，课余还要娱乐好。我那时在基层政治机关搞宣传报道工作，我们的一个头儿到上边办的班里去读《反杜林论》。他读了２０天，体重增加了好几斤，临结业时，读书班要求每个学员写一篇大批判文章。于是我和一同事被召到读书班所在招待所，帮助他写大批判稿。我俩当时都没读过这本书，现找书来翻了翻，干了一通宵，搞出了一篇大批判稿。第二天，此稿居然在小组会上受到好评，还被推荐到学习班大会上去宣读……从那时起我就对花很多钱办读书班不以为然。当然我们不能把当前的一些读书班与“文革”时的“读书班”相提并论。
    看书学习是好事，尤其在当前治理整顿、深化改革的形势下，亟需提高全体干部的思想理论水平。让干部轮流脱离繁重的日常工作，使之能集中时间和精力读点书也是应该的。但是，创造良好的学习条件就一定要把人员集中在一起，由公家出钱管住、管吃吗？我看未必。再说，公家出钱管住管吃、提供种种“良好条件”，就一定能学得好吗？我看也未必。公家出钱，每人每天好几十元，这样的“读书班”不要说不好好学对不起人民，就是好好学也还是对不起人民的。
    其实，组织学习的方式方法多种多样。比如让参加学习的同志在规定的时间里离开工作岗位，给他们布置阅读书目，出一些题考试等等。有辅导报告或安排讨论时可以集中起来，其它的时间由个人自行安排。这样吃住在个人自己的家中，只要严格要求，还是会收到好效果的。当然，最重要的是要培养大家养成平素读书的习惯，这才是根本的措施。
    “公费读书”风和公费旅游、公费请客送礼异曲同工，同样应在克服之列。趁着现在一些拟办的读书班还没办，一些拟花的公费还没花，刹刹这股“公费读书”风，为时还不晚。
