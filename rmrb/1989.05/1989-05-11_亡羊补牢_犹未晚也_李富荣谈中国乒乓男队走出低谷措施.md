	It's Not Too Late to Mend the Fence After the Sheep Are Gone
	– Li Fuhong on Measures for the Chinese Men's Table Tennis Team to Overcome the Slump

	The loss of several "crowns" in men's table tennis from the "Kingdom of Table Tennis" has attracted widespread attention from fans. Now, many people have shifted from understanding to "what next." On May 10, Li Fuhong, Director of the State Sports Commission Training Bureau, revealed to reporters and table tennis fans in Beijing and Taiwan the plans of the Chinese table tennis community for the future.

	Li Fuhong said that to get through the difficulties, the leadership of the Chinese Table Tennis Association needs to first unify their understanding. Only with a unified understanding can there be unified action. He pointed out that after the 32nd and 35th World Table Tennis Championships, some outstanding new players surpassed the old generation and quickly regained the championship. This time, the new players' techniques and overall level have not surpassed the old generation; there are "new players but no new techniques or new technologies," so regaining the championship is very difficult.

	He proposed several measures:

	First, the innovation of techniques and tactics must be placed in a very important position, but innovation is not easy. Major changes require time and specific analysis. For example, for old players like Chen Longcan, only "repairs and adjustments" can be made; for new players like Shen Tan and Ma Wenge, the steps to change techniques and training methods can be bigger; for even younger team members, cultivation must definitely follow the development trend of world table tennis.

	Second, emphasize the cultivation of athletes' tenacious style and further improve the training level.

	Third, make necessary adjustments to the current team, including the retirement of old players like Jiang Jialiang and the recruitment of new players.

	Fourth, mobilize the strength of the entire table tennis community nationwide to discuss how to get out of the predicament and overcome the slump faster. A training work conference will be held in the second half of the year to discuss issues such as where to start innovation.

	Fifth, regularly train young players from various places and discover talents in a timely manner.

　　“亡羊补牢”犹未晚也    
    ——李富荣谈中国乒乓男队走出低谷措施
    “乒乓王国”的几顶男子“王冠”失落，曾引起球迷广泛关注。如今，许多人已从理解转向“今后怎么办”。国家体委训练局局长李富荣５月１０日向首都和台湾体育记者以及北京球迷代表透露了中国乒乓球界今后的打算。
    李富荣说，要渡过难关，中国乒乓球协会的领导层首先需要统一认识，认识一致才能统一行动。他指出，第３２届、第３５届世乒赛后都有一些出色的新手超过了老一代，很快夺回了冠军。这一次新手的技术打法、整体水平没有超过老一代，是“有新手没有新打法、新技术”，因此再重新夺回冠军难度很大。
    他提出了几条措施：
    一、技术打法的创新要放在非常重要的位置上，但创新不是轻而易举的，大的改动需要时间，还要作具体分析。如对陈龙灿等老运动员，只能是“修修补补”；对于沈潼、马文革等新手，改变技术打法、训练方法的步子可迈大些；对更年轻的队员的培养则一定要符合世界乒乓球运动的发展趋势。
    二、注重培养运动员的顽强作风，进一步提高训练水平。
    三、对现有队伍作必要的调整，包括江嘉良等老运动员退役和吸收新人。
    四、动员全国乒乓球界的力量，探讨怎样才能更快摆脱困境，走出低谷。下半年召开训练工作会议，讨论创新从何入手等问题。
    五、定期集训各地年轻选手，及时发现人才。
