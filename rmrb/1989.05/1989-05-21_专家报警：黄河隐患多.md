	Experts Warn: Yellow River Faces Multiple Hazards
	By Li Erliang, Reporter for this newspaper

	Five consecutive years of peace have led the people along the Yellow River to somewhat forget the disasters brought by past floods. However, the various hidden dangers in the Yellow River's flood control efforts are constantly issuing warnings: if we remain complacent, the consequences will be dire.

	Recently, the reporter learned from the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters that this warning is not just the experts' groundless worries, but clear facts. The Yellow River's floods mainly threaten the four provinces of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, and Shandong downstream. Currently, there are 53 weak points and vulnerable sections in the downstream flood control projects that have not been reinforced. There are 18 dangerous sluices and 10 severely corroded siphon pipes that have not been renovated. Many levees lack sufficient foundation stones and are not high enough. The Yellow River, with its increasing sediment load, is continuously raising the riverbed. In recent years, the riverbed has risen an average of 0.3 meters, and the difference in height between the riverbed and the floodplain has further decreased. The river's course has become more unstable, and many projects that could previously withstand major floods now face the risk of overtopping and breaching during moderate floods.

	This year's flood season is particularly concerning due to severe damage to flood control facilities and a severe lack of flood control funds. Along the Yellow River, the trend of illegal individuals stealing and cutting flood control communication lines is worsening. Just from last year to now, there have been 66 cases, with over 40,000 meters of wires stolen. Flood control funds are severely insufficient, leading to many outdated devices not being replaced or supplemented. The most crucial flood control material, stones, is half the required amount, and there are also significant shortages of materials like sandbags.

	However, the greatest hidden danger related to these situations is the complacency that has grown among the cadres and people along the Yellow River. Many people lack the mental preparedness for major floods, and some, with a gambling mentality, have moved to the Yellow River floodplains to cultivate land. According to investigations, just in the area around Tongguan and Fenglingdu in Shaanxi, there are over 80,000 former reservoir migrants who have settled here. If a major flood occurs, these villages and people will be in great danger.

### 专家报警：黄河隐患多

　　专家报警：黄河隐患多
    本报记者  李而亮
    连续５年平安无事，使黄河两岸的群众似乎对昔日洪荒带来的灾难有所淡忘了。然而，目前黄河汛防存在的种种隐患却无时不在发出警告：如果再掉以轻心，后果将会不堪设想。
    记者近日在黄河防汛总指挥部了解到，这一警告的发出，绝不是专家们的杞人忧天，而是明摆着的事实。黄河洪水主要威胁地是下游的陕、晋、豫、鲁４省，目前在下游的防汛工程上，仍有５３处险点和薄弱环节未加固处理，１８座险闸和１０条锈蚀严重的虹吸管道没有改造。不少堤坝根石不足，高度不够，而黄河水正以其日益增大的含沙量，不断淤积增高着河槽，近年来，河槽平均增高了０．３米，滩槽高差进一步缩小，宽河道的河势摆动进一步加剧，许多过去能抵御大洪水的工程，现在要遇上中常洪水，就有漫滩垮坝的危险。
    今年汛期尤值得忧虑的是防洪设施被毁严重和防洪资财严重不足。沿黄不法分子盗割防汛通讯线路之风愈演愈烈，光是去年到现在就发案６６起，割盗电线４万多米。防汛资金严重不足，以至许多早该淘汰的设备得不到更新补充。防洪最主要的石料相差一半，麻袋等材料缺口也很大。
    然而，与这些情况相联系的最大隐患，则是沿黄干部群众滋生的麻痹思想。许多人缺乏防大汛的思想准备，不少怀着侥幸心理的群众移居黄河滩上，开荒垦地。据调查，光陕西潼关风陵渡一带，就有８万多昔日建水库迁走的移民在此定居，遇上大洪水，这里的村庄和群众将会难逃劫运。
