    The following numbers represent the student dropout rates from the junior high schools of six middle schools in the ancient city district of Bozhou, Anhui Province, in 1988:

    　　Longde Middle School: 108 students;
    　　Yangji Middle School: 120 students;
    　　Yangdian Middle School: 126 students;
    　　Lide Middle School: 115 students;
    　　Licun Middle School: 150 students;
    　　Youhe Middle School: 151 students.

    They left the classrooms, exited the school gates, and ventured into society. Their departing figures, however, left us with:

    He, 17 years old, male, intelligent and eager to learn. Suddenly, his father, who had taken over a village brick kiln, ordered him to stop studying! He was unwilling, and I was puzzled. During a home visit, I met his father.

    “Why do you want him to stop studying?”

    “What’s the use of studying nowadays? ‘North and South officials, just for food and clothing.’ Even with a college degree, you only earn a hundred or eighty yuan a month, what’s the point!”

    She, 17 years old. She didn’t come to school for two days, and on the third day, she sent a letter through someone else:

    “I left without saying goodbye, which is very impolite. I was afraid you would stop me. By the time you read this, I will already be on the train to Beijing. I plan to go with my cousin to work as a nanny in Beijing. I don’t have much hope for my studies (even if I get into college, what’s the point?)…”

    He, 18 years old. The 58th dropout from our school. I talked to him, and he said: “What’s the use of studying? I can’t get into college anyway. I don’t learn anything in school, and tuition is expensive. It’s better to earn some money and learn a skill to make a living.”

    As a teacher, I feel deeply pained. A large number of school-age youth, with their various immaturities and biases, leave school and enter society, realizing their so-called plant-like value too early and at a low level. This is not beneficial for the development and progress of society, nor is it beneficial for the Four Modernizations and the prosperity of the Chinese nation!

    One figure after another, leaving behind an exclamation mark, a cry: — The foundation of national and ethnic prosperity — knowledge and scholars urgently need to be valued!

    One figure after another, leaving behind a question mark, a reproach: — How should school education content and management mechanisms be adjusted and improved?

　　作为一名教师……
    安徽省亳州市立德中学  李景强
    这一组醒目的数字，是安徽省亳州市古城区六所中学初中部１９８８年学生流失情况：
    　　龙德中学　　１０８人；
    　　杨集中学　　１２０人；
    　　杨店中学　　１２６人；
    　　立德中学　　１１５人；
    　　李村中学　　１５０人；
    　　油河中学　　１５１人。
    他们一个个离开了教室，走出了校门，走向了社会。而那一个个背影，却留给了我们——
    他，１７岁，男，聪明好学。忽然，承包行政村砖窑的父亲要他停学！他不情愿，我不理解。家访时我见到其父。
    “你为何叫他停学呢？”
    “现今的学有个啥上头？‘南北做官，为了吃穿’嘛。大专生，一月不过百儿八十块，顶个啥！”
    她，１７岁。两天不见她来校，第三天，她托人带来一封信——
    “我不辞而别，太不礼貌。因怕老师阻拦。当您读到信时，我已坐在去北京的火车上了。我打算跟表姐一块到北京当‘褓姆’，我对考学没什么希望（考上学又怎么样呢？）……”
    他，１８岁。我校第５８个“流失”者。我找他谈话，他说：“上啥呢，我又考不上，在学校也学不到啥，学费又贵。还不如拿点钱出去学一门谋生的手艺呢”。
    作为一名教师，我深感痛心。大量学龄青少年带着他们的各种幼稚和偏激，离开学校，踏入社会，过早地、低水平地实现所谓自身的植物性价值，这不利于社会的发展和进步，不利于四化大业和中华民族的振兴发达！
    一个个背影，留下一个个“！”，一句句呐喊：——国家和民族兴旺之本——知识和知识者急待升值！
    一个个背影，留下一个个“？”，一句句责问：——学校教育内容和管理机制如何调整完善？
