The U.S. Department of Labor announced on May 18 that consumer prices in the United States rose by 0.7 percent in April, the highest monthly increase in more than two years.

The Department of Labor said that the sharp rise in consumer prices was mainly due to increases in energy and food prices. In April, gasoline prices in the United States rose by 11.4 percent, the largest monthly increase since the 1930s, pushing the overall increase in energy prices to a record 5.1 percent.

In the first four months of this year, the U.S. consumer price index rose by 6.6 percent on an annualized basis, higher than the 4.4 percent annual increase in the previous two years.
