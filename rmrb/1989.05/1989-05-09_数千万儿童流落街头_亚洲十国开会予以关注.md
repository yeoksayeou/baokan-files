Xinhua News Agency, Manila, May 8th.

The first international conference on Asian street children opened today here. The conference aims to raise public awareness about this issue.

The conference was held at the Philippine presidential palace, attended by 150 social workers from 10 Asian countries. Twenty representatives of the 1.2 million street children in the Philippines were invited as guests to attend the conference.

During the opening ceremony, Filipino children performed scenes of street children wandering, begging, sleeping rough, selling cigarettes, selling newspapers, and scavenging for trash, which moved the representatives to tears.

Philippine President Corazon Aquino emphasized at the conference that saving street children has become an urgent matter. She said, "The future of the world belongs to our children. If the children who will be the masters of tomorrow are destroyed and not cared for, imagine what the future world will be like!"

The week-long conference was initiated by the United Nations Children's Fund and an international organization dedicated to rescuing street children.

According to the organizers' report, there are currently 100 million street children worldwide, with 20 to 30 million in Asia. The report states that if countries do not take measures, the number of street children in the world will reach 200 million by 2010.
