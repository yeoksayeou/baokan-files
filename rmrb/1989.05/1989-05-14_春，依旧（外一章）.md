Spring, as ever

You casually say, “Spring, as ever,” and lazily leave.

Ah, the gloom of winter, the coldness of winter, the icy touch of winter, all quietly follow you away.

When did the small peach tree on the balcony sprout its fuzzy buds?

Oh, as ever. Spring always emerges unnoticed in lethargy. Who knows which day will suddenly surprise you: the spring life before your eyes is so unrestrained, so free and vibrant!

Spring, as ever…

The clouds are as ever serene, as ever indifferent to the mountains; the returning green is as ever hurried, as ever wild; the drizzle is as ever hazy, the peach and plum blossoms as ever shy… The wind as ever boldly slips into your collar, as ever stirring a strange delight; the moon as ever faint, as ever tempting a faint sorrow.

You? You only say spring is as ever, but forget that the new leaves once said: the spring of love is as ever.

The Tree of Longing

I want to plant a grove of tall, strong longing trees.

Walking carefully, my feet are cold and damp, trembling with the surging desire of the earth's crust.

No need to look back, the dogtail grass will sweep away your eager impulses, the confusion of impulse, the sadness of confusion, and the numbness of sadness…

Everything is hurried, no time to look back, just collide and vanish in the eternal flow of the atmosphere.

I too will grow old, perhaps very soon; I too will have no blood, no sinews, no flesh… I want to bare myself, but I am as barren as a desert!

Where are the tears of longing I treasured?

Temptation is as red as blood, the sky does not age, emotions do not fade, people remain the same.

　　春，依旧（外一章）
    刘莉
    你丢一句：“春，依旧”，就懒懒地去了。
    呵，冬的郁闷，冬的冷漠，冬凉冰冰的触摸，也都幽幽地随你去了。
    什么时候，阳台上那株小桃绽出了毛茸茸的芽苞？
    哦，依旧。春总是在倦怠中不知不觉地冒出，谁知道哪一天，会蓦地惊奇：横在眼前的竟是这样放肆、这样无拘无束躁动着春的生灵！
    春，依旧……
    依旧娴静的游云，依旧没有眷念山?；依旧急急忙忙的返青，依旧没能改掉的野性；依旧迷迷蒙蒙的细雨，依旧好害羞的桃李……风依旧无所顾忌地溜进脖颈，依旧荡起一种奇妙的快意；月儿依旧淡淡的，依旧诱惑着似有似无的惆怅。
    你呢？只说春依旧，可忘了，那新叶曾说过：爱的春天依旧。
    相思树
    我想种一片相思高高大大的树。
    小心翼翼地走，脚上凉丝丝湿乎乎的，颤栗着地壳欲望的奔涌。
    无须回头，狗尾巴草会扫去你热切的冲动，冲动的困惑，困惑的悲哀和悲哀的麻木……
    一切都匆匆忙忙，来不及再看一眼，就撞碎，就消失在大气层永恒的横流。
    我也会老，也许就在不久的以后；也会没有血没有筋没有肉……想袒露，却如荒漠般贫瘠！
    珍藏的相思泪呢？
    诱惑如血一般红，天不老情不老人依旧。
