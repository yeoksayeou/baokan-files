The construction of the Asian Games projects has not been significantly affected recently, and the overall progress is basically normal.

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 25 – A relevant person from the Construction Command Headquarters of the Asian Games projects told reporters yesterday: Through the efforts of the majority of workers, the Asian Games projects have overcome difficulties and have not been significantly affected in recent days.

The person from the Construction Command Headquarters said that, except for a few construction sites experiencing delays in material supply and a small number of workers arriving late to work, there have been no instances of work stoppages so far, and the overall progress of the projects is basically normal.

Several medium and small sports venues scattered in the urban and suburban areas of Beijing have been completed or basically completed in phases since last year and earlier this year. The focus of this year's work is on the Northern Suburban Sports Center and the Northern Suburban Asian Games Village along both sides of the North Fourth Ring Road.

The relevant person from the Construction Command Headquarters said that the cadres and workers working here mostly eat and live on the construction site. Those who live in the city have been commuting by bicycle in recent days, so there has been no significant fluctuation in the number of people on the construction site. Although the transportation of materials on a few construction sites has encountered some difficulties, the workers have been finding ways to ensure transportation by going through streets and alleys, so it has not had a significant impact on the projects.

It is reported that the construction of the Asian Games Athletes' Village is progressing rapidly. The interior equipment installation of the five completed tower-style apartments is underway, and the structural work of the remaining apartments is also progressing quickly. The 8-story high Asian Games Organizing Committee office building and press center has completed the 3-story complex atypical structure, and the subsequent 5-story standard layer structure will accelerate. The office building, which was still at the 8th structural layer more than 10 days ago, has now risen to the 10th layer. The Northern Gymnasium and Northern Swimming Stadium, known as the "eyes of the Asian Games projects," have both completed their truss structures, and the roof panel hoisting work has also been completed by more than 35%.

The main projects of the Northern Sports Center and the Northern Asian Games Village have both completed 50% of this year's planned work.

　　亚运会工程近日来未受大影响
    整个建设进展基本正常
    新华社北京５月２５日电  亚运会工程建设总指挥部有关人士昨天告诉记者：亚运会工程的建设经过广大职工的努力，克服困难，近些日子以来没有受到大的影响。
    工程指挥部的人士说，除个别亚运会工地一度出现进料不及时、少量工人上班迟到等现象外，迄今尚未发现停工现象，整个工程进度基本正常。
    亚运会工程中分散于北京城区和近郊区的一批中小体育场馆已分别于去年和今年早些时候陆续完工或基本完工，今年的工作重点集中在位于北四环路两侧的北郊体育中心和北郊亚运村。
    工程总指挥部的同志说，在这里工作的干部和工人大多吃住在工地，一些在城里住的人连日来都骑车上下班，因此在工地人员上没有出现大的波动；个别工地材料运输虽一时有些困难，但工人们穿街过巷千方百计保证运输，因此也未对工程造成大的影响。
    据悉，目前亚运会运动员村的建设进展较快，５栋已封顶的塔式公寓正在进行内部设备安装，其余几栋公寓的结构工程进展也很快；总高８层的亚运会组委会办公楼暨新闻中心已完成３层复杂的异型结构，以后５层标准层结构进展将会加快速度；１０多天前还停留在结构８层的写字楼，现在已长高到１０层。被誉为“亚运会工程之目”的北部体育馆和北部游泳馆，网架结构均已完成，屋面板吊装工作也已完成３５％以上。
    北部体育中心和北部亚运村的主要工程均已完成今年计划工作量的５０％。
