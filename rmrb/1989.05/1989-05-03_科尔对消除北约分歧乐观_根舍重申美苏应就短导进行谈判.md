Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 2nd.

Federal German Chancellor Kohl expressed optimism about resolving the disagreements among NATO allies over the issue of short-range missiles. He believes that the conflicting parties may reach some form of compromise during the NATO high-level meeting in Brussels on May 29-30.

Kohl made these remarks after meeting with Italian Prime Minister De Mita. He said that after resolving the issue of intermediate-range missiles, the United States and the Soviet Union should engage in negotiations on strategic weapons, while also considering the reduction of short-range missiles in Europe.

On the issue of European short-range missiles, there is a disagreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom. The United States and the United Kingdom advocate for modernizing the Lance short-range missiles deployed in Western Europe. In contrast, the Federal Republic of Germany believes there is currently no need for this and proposes that NATO accept the Warsaw Pact countries' suggestion to negotiate the reduction of short-range missiles in Europe. To coordinate the positions of Germany and the United Kingdom, Italian Prime Minister De Mita visited London last week.

Kohl's visit to Rome aims to understand the British position through De Mita.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, May 2nd.

Federal German Foreign Minister Genscher reiterated in a speech on the second German television channel tonight that the United States and the Soviet Union should negotiate over short-range nuclear weapons.

Genscher stated that the Bonn government's position is to first establish a common upper limit for short-range nuclear weapons in the East and West, and then, by the early 1990s, based on the progress of the Vienna conventional weapons talks, decide whether short-range missiles are still needed.

He said that the Federal Government's stance is gaining "increasing support" within the NATO alliance. He emphasized that the purpose of the negotiations is to eliminate the Soviet Union's advantage in short-range weapons.

He also stressed that in the current decision-making process of NATO, West Germany has a "decisive voice."

He said that West Germany has made the "greatest contribution" to NATO's conventional defense, and short-range missiles are deployed in West Germany.

　　科尔对消除北约分歧乐观   
    根舍重申美苏应就短导进行谈判
    新华社罗马５月２日电  正在意大利访问的联邦德国总理科尔对消除北约盟国在短程导弹问题上的分歧持“乐观态度”，并认为分歧双方在本月２９日至３０日举行的布鲁塞尔北约高级会晤中可能会作出某种“妥协”。
    科尔在同意大利总理德米塔会谈之后对记者说，在中程导弹问题解决之后，美苏两国应就战略武器问题进行谈判，同时，也必须考虑削减欧洲短程导弹问题。
    在欧洲短程导弹问题上，联邦德国与英国发生分歧。美、英主张使部署在西欧的长矛式短程导弹现代化。而联邦德国认为目前尚无此必要，同时，建议北约接受华约国家就削减欧洲短导问题进行谈判的建议。为协调德、英双方立场，意大利总理德米塔上周专门访问了伦敦。
    科尔此次罗马之行的目的是要通过德米塔了解英国立场。
    新华社波恩５月２日电　联邦德国外交部长根舍今晚在西德第二电视台发表讲话，重申美苏应就短程核武器进行谈判。
    根舍说，波恩政府的态度是：首先规定东西方短程核武器的共同上限，然后，在９０年代初根据维也纳常规武器谈判的进展，决定是否还需要短程导弹。
    他说，联邦政府的这一立场在北约联盟内得到“越来越多的支持”。他说，谈判的目的在于消除苏联在短程武器上的优势。
    他还强调，在北约目前的决策过程中，西德有“决定性的发言权”。
    他说，波恩对北约“常规防御作的贡献最大”，而且短程导弹部署在西德。
