UN Secretary-General Discusses Cambodia and Afghanistan Issues
Consideration of Sending Peacekeeping Forces to Cambodia
Calls for Agreement Between Afghan Parties

Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 8th. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today urged the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia as the first step in resolving the Cambodian issue. He also mentioned that he has been considering the deployment of UN peacekeeping forces to Cambodia to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

Pérez de Cuéllar, speaking at the Asia Society, pointed out that Vietnam should first withdraw its troops from Cambodia, after which the various Cambodian factions can work together to find a solution to their internal problems.

He said, "Once the Vietnamese withdraw from the country, I hope the Cambodian people will solve their own problems without allowing foreign interference."

Pérez de Cuéllar stated that he has been considering sending a UN peacekeeping force to Cambodia. He said, "We can play a role there." The Secretary-General added, "If the Cambodian people want us to supervise the elections, if they want us to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, we will go there."

Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 8th. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today called on all Afghans to reach an agreement on establishing a government with a broad base, and said that the future of Afghanistan depends on the efforts of the Afghan people themselves.

Pérez de Cuéllar, speaking at a meeting of the Asia Society, said that although it is difficult to reach an agreement between the Kabul government and the Afghan resistance forces, the UN will continue to help the Afghan people in this direction. He noted that with the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan according to the Geneva Accords, the first important aspect of the Afghan issue has been resolved. Currently, the focus should be on stopping interference in Afghanistan and Pakistan and allowing the 5 million Afghan refugees stranded in Pakistan and Iran to return home.

He hopes that all relevant parties, including the United States and the Soviet Union, will abide by the Geneva Accords and, together with the UN, quickly find a way to resolve the Afghan issue.

　　联合国秘书长谈柬埔寨和阿富汗问题    
    考虑向柬派和平部队
    呼吁阿双方达成协议
    新华社纽约５月８日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天敦促越南军队撤出柬埔寨，作为解决柬埔寨问题的第一步。他还说，他一直在考虑向柬埔寨派遣联合国维持和平部队，监督越南撤军。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在这里对亚洲协会发表讲话时指出，越南首先应该把军队撤出柬埔寨，然后柬各派才可共同努力，找出解决他们内部问题的办法。
    他说，“一旦越南人撤出这个国家，我希望柬埔寨人将自己解决自己的问题，不允许外国进行干涉。”
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔说，他一直在考虑向柬派遣一支联合国维持和平部队。他说，“我们能在那儿发挥作用。”这位秘书长说，“如果柬埔寨人希望我们监督大选，如果他们要我们监督越南撤军，我们将前往那里。”
    新华社纽约５月８日电　联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天呼吁所有阿富汗人就建立一个具有广泛基础的政府达成协议，并说阿富汗的前途有赖于阿富汗人民自己的努力。
    佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔在这里对亚洲协会的一次讲话中说，虽然要使喀布尔政府和阿抵抗力量之间达成协议是很困难的，但联合国将继续帮助阿富汗人民朝着这个方向而努力。他指出，在苏联根据日内瓦协议从阿撤军后，阿富汗问题的第一个重要方面已经解决。目前应着重解决的是停止对阿富汗和巴基斯坦的干涉和让滞留在巴基斯坦和伊朗的５００万阿富汗难民返回家园。
    他希望包括美国和苏联在内的有关各方遵守日内瓦协议，并与联合国一道尽快找到解决阿富汗问题的方式。
