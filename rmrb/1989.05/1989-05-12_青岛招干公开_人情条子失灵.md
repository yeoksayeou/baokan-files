More than 1,000 letters of recommendation and phone calls failed to influence the public recruitment of officials in Qingdao.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, May 12 (Correspondent Liang Qingfan, Reporter Liu Haimin) Over 1,000 letters of recommendation and phone calls failed to influence the public recruitment of officials in Qingdao.

Since last December, Qingdao has been recruiting 553 officials for 11 departments including public security, auditing, industry and commerce, taxation, and banking across the city. After the news was announced, nearly 10,000 people signed up in the first few days, with a ratio of applicants to selected candidates of 16:1.

Although the Municipal Personnel Bureau had issued a notice before the recruitment stating that it would be open and fair, with no special treatment for any connections, the bureau was soon flooded with "please give special consideration" letters, which came in like snowflakes.

Facing over a thousand letters of recommendation and phone calls, the Qingdao Municipal Personnel Bureau insisted on transparency in examination scores, application preferences, selection procedures and methods, initial selection cutoff scores, and the list of selected candidates. The bureau also welcomed public supervision.

　　青岛招干公开　人情条子失灵
    据新华社青岛５月１２日电（通讯员梁清凡  记者刘海民）１０００多人的求情条子和电话在青岛市公开招收干部中失灵。
    自去年底到现在，青岛市在全市范围内陆续为政法、审计、工商、税务、银行等１１个部门招收５５３名干部。消息传出后，头几天报名者就有近万人，投考者与录取者的比例为１６∶１。
    尽管在招干之前，市人事局已发出公开招考，不照顾任何关系的告示，但一时间市人事局里“八面来风”，大批大批的“请予关照”的条子像雪片似地飞来。
    面对上千人的求情条子和电话，青岛市人事局坚持考试分数公开，报考志愿公开，录取程序和方法公开，初选分数线公开，录取名单公开，并欢迎群众监督。
