The Chinese team won all seven titles at the Shanghai China Open Table Tennis Championships. Xu Shaofa, the head coach of the Chinese team, believes that the level of competition in this tournament was average, and it was expected that the Chinese team would achieve such excellent results. However, from the competition, it can be seen that the men's team currently has veterans who are overly fatigued and newcomers who lack experience.

After the World Table Tennis Championships, Jiang Jialiang and Teng Yi retired, making Chen Longcan the most experienced player on the Chinese men's team. However, in the men's singles quarterfinals of this open tournament, he lost 1-3 to An Jae-hong of South Korea, who has had poor singles results in recent years. Xu Shaofa believes that Chen Longcan mainly lost due to fatigue. Over the past year, Chen Longcan participated in the Olympic Games and the World Table Tennis Championships, and a series of competitions and training have left him in a state of extreme fatigue. This is the main reason for his recent losses in the Asian Cup and this open tournament. Chen Longcan needs a long period of rest. The two young players of the Chinese team, Ma Wen'ge and Yu Shentong, participated in the World Table Tennis Championships and the Asian Cup, and this time they were the main players in the team competition. Xu Shaofa said that their frequent appearances in competitions are mainly to accumulate experience. After some veterans left the team, he and Ma Wen'ge, these two newcomers, have become the focus of the Chinese men's team's development.

Xu Shaofa is satisfied with Ma Wen'ge's performance. This young player, who is skilled in playing forehand loops with a penholder, changed his backhand rubber to a pips-out rubber after the World Table Tennis Championships, increasing the spin on the ball. In the competition, he defeated the South Korean star Kim Jae-hyeong twice, advancing to the men's singles top four, and with Yu Shentong, he defeated Olympic champions Chen Longcan and Wei Qingguang, winning the men's doubles title. Xu Shaofa believes that he is currently in the adaptation phase of using the new racket, and after some time, he is expected to improve further.

Regarding Yu Shentong's loss to Sweden's fifth-ranked player Carlsson in the men's singles, Xu Shaofa commented: "His game still needs a lot of work. His movement speed is not fast enough, and his power is weak, often appearing passive under the opponent's control."

Another player on the Chinese team is Chen Zhibin, who is known as a "late bloomer." This 26-year-old player won the men's singles title at the Swedish Open two years ago. He is a typical European-style penholder with a looping game, described by the Swedish team coach Oster as "a Chinese player with a European-style game that even Europeans find difficult to handle." In the men's singles final, he defeated An Jae-hong 3-0, ensuring that the Chinese team won all the gold medals.

Xu Shaofa stated that the main task for the Chinese team in the future is to train and develop new players. They need to change the current situation where young players have monotonous and outdated playing styles, and catch up with the leading technical level of Europe.

　　老将过于疲劳　新手尚欠火候
    ——许绍发评中国乒乓球男队表现
    中国队囊括了上海中国乒乓球公开赛所有七个项目的冠军，中国队总教练许绍发认为，这次比赛水平一般，中国队能有如此佳绩乃意料中事，但从比赛中可以看出，男队目前是老将过于疲劳，新手尚欠火候。
    世乒赛后，江嘉良、滕毅相继退役，陈龙灿成为中国男队经验最丰富的选手。但在这次公开赛男单１／４决赛中，他以１∶３输给了南朝鲜近年单打成绩不佳的安宰亨。许绍发认为，陈龙灿主要是输在体力上。近一年来，陈龙灿参加了奥运会和世乒赛两大赛事，一系列的征战和训练已使他处于极其疲劳的状态，这是导致他在前不久的亚洲杯赛和这次公开赛上失利的主要原因。陈龙灿急需较长时间的休息。中国队的两名小将马文革和于沈潼在参加了世乒赛和亚洲杯赛后，这次出任团体主力。许绍发说，他们频繁出赛，主要是为了积累经验。在一些老将离队之后，他和马文革这两名新手升格为中国男队的主力，是培养的重点。
    许绍发对马文革的表现感到满意。这位横拍善拉弧圈球的小将，在世乒赛后将反手的正胶改成了反贴，加强了球的旋转。在比赛中曾两次击败南朝鲜队的新星金泽洙，进入男单前四名，并和于沈潼合作战胜了奥运会冠军陈龙灿和韦晴光，夺得男双冠军。许绍发认为，他目前还处于适应新拍的阶段，一段时间之后，可望有更大的提高。
    对于于沈潼在男单比赛中输给瑞典的五号选手卡尔松，许绍发评论说：“他的球目前还要狠下功夫。他在移动中的速度还不够快，力量显得薄弱，在对方的调动下往往显得十分被动。”
    中国队另一位队员是“大器晚成”的陈志斌，这位２６岁的选手两年前曾夺得瑞典公开赛的男子单打冠军。他是典型的欧洲横拍弧圈球打法，被瑞典队教练奥斯特称作“欧洲人也难以对付的欧洲式打法的中国选手”。他在这次男单决赛中以３∶０轻取安宰亨，确保了中国队包揽全部金牌。
    许绍发表示，中国队今后的主要工作放在培养锻炼新手上。要改变年轻选手打法单调落后的现状，迎头赶上欧洲目前领先的技术水平。
