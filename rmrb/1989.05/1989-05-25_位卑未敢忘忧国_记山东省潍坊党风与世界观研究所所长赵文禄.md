	Humble Status but Unforgettable Patriotism
	—Recalling Zhao Wenlu, Director of the Weifang Party Spirit and Worldview Research Institute
	Chen Weiwei
	On the afternoon of March 14, at a meeting on letters and visits held in Zhongnanhai, a central leader firmly shook the hand of a thin middle-aged man and said, "Thank you for your good suggestions and for supporting our work."

	The middle-aged man is Zhao Wenlu, director of the Weifang Party Spirit and Worldview Research Institute and deputy professor at the Weifang Municipal Party School. He was invited to attend the national letters and visits meeting as a representative of the nation to participate in politics and to make active suggestions to the central government.

	Eighteen years ago, he was only 20 years old but had already become a young member of the Communist Party. The Lin Biao incident in 1971 deeply shocked him. A strong sense of historical responsibility for the country, the party, and the people led him to write a "ten-thousand-word letter" to Chairman Mao Zedong after a series of reflections, directly pointing out the dangers of personal worship and strongly advocating for the protection of the party's body...

	Since then, during his more than ten years of work, he has sincerely written over 100 letters and articles to higher-level organizations and relevant newspapers and radio stations, boldly exposing and criticizing social ills, and striving to rectify the party's style. At the same time, he has conducted extensive social investigations, and based on a large amount of social reality, he has published more than 60 theoretical articles with unique insights.

	Zhao Wenlu's actions have shocked the nation. In recent years, he has received tens of thousands of letters from people of all walks of life. Liang Zai, the former dean of academic affairs at Hunan University and a 73-year-old retired old man, traveled to Weifang to visit him and wrote a poem: "How can the party's style be clean? The nation's feelings, praying and complaining are not the best strategy, seeking the truth in the worldview, and finding the way out in the dark..."

	Zhao Wenlu was deeply moved time and time again. He decided to spare no effort to advocate for the rectification of the party's style. In 1986, the Weifang Party Spirit and Worldview Research Institute was established with Zhao Wenlu as its director, making it the first of its kind in the country. Now, the institute is actively preparing for the Party Spirit Research Association, mobilizing social forces nationwide to conduct research on the party's style, and compiling and publishing series such as "Party Spirit and Worldview" and "Scientific Research on Party Spirit" to explore the external environment, intrinsic nature, and development laws of party style construction in the new era, guiding party style construction practice with scientific theory on party style.

	During his visit to Beijing to attend the meeting, the reporter interviewed this 38-year-old young scholar. He told me: In order to better understand the social situation and public opinion and reflect the people's voice, he had discussions and exchanges with the letters and visits department, the municipal federation of trade unions, the municipal political consultative conference, the Weifang Municipal Party School, and colleagues from some universities and military units in Beijing. In his two speeches at the letters and visits meeting, he talked about opinions that were widely welcomed and valued by the people. As the meeting was about to end, he submitted another letter to the central leadership, suggesting that various forms and channels be used for propaganda and education to unify people's understanding of the party's style and clean governance, solve the widespread confusion and misconceptions about the party's style in society, and promote the comprehensive deepening of reform and opening up. His words were sincere, and his writing was earnest. Time is passing, but Zhao Wenlu seems to have endless energy and courage...

　　位卑未敢忘忧国
    ——记山东省潍坊党风与世界观研究所所长赵文禄
    本报记者  陈维伟
    ３月１４日下午，在中南海举行的一次信访工作座谈会上，一位中央领导同志紧紧握住一位清瘦的中年人的手说：“谢谢你，提出了好的意见，支持了我们的工作。”
    中年人叫赵文禄，是潍坊党风与世界观研究所所长、潍坊市委党校副教授。他是作为全国参政议政、向中央提出积极建议的代表应邀出席全国信访工作会议的。
    １８年前，他刚刚２０岁，却已是一名年轻的共产党员了。１９７１年林彪事件强烈地震动了他，一种忧国忧党忧民的强烈历史责任感使他在一连串的思索之后，果敢地提起笔给毛泽东同志写了“万言书”，直陈个人迷信的危害，强烈要求爱护党的肌体……
    那以后，在他参加工作的１０多年中，他怀着对党的至诚之情，向上级组织及有关报刊电台写了１００余件书信和稿件，大胆揭露和抨击社会时弊，竭力呼吁端正党风。同时，他还广泛进行社会调查，针对大量的社会实际，发表了６０多篇见解独到的理论文章。
    赵文禄的举动震动了全国。近年来，他收到的各阶层人士来信数以万计。原湖南大学教务长、７３岁的离休老人梁再专程到潍坊拜访他，并赋词道：“咋叫党风清？举国关情，祈求抱怨非上策，世界观中寻妙谛，柳暗花明……”
    赵文禄一次次被深深感动了，他决心竭尽心力为端正党风鼓与呼。１９８６年，以赵文禄为所长的潍坊党风与世界观研究所成立，为全国第一家。现在，该所正积极筹备党风研究会，动员全国的社会力量开展党风研究，编写出版《党风与世界观》、《党风科学研究》等系列丛书，探讨新时期党风建设的外部环境、内在本质及其发展规律，以党风科学理论指导党风建设实践。
    赵文禄这次赴京参加座谈会期间，记者采访了这位３８岁的年轻学者。他告诉我：为了更好地了解社情民意，反映人民的呼声，他与潍坊市信访部门、市总工会、市政协、潍坊市委党校及北京一些大专院校和部队的同志座谈交流，他在这次信访座谈会上的两次发言中谈了深受人们欢迎和重视的意见。在座谈会即将结束时，他又向中央领导上了一书，建议通过各种形式和渠道进行宣传教育，统一人们对党风与廉政问题的认识，解决社会上普遍存在的对党风问题的模糊认识和错误看法，促进改革开放的全面深化。口中切切语，笔下恳恳言。岁月在不停地流逝，然而，赵文禄却似乎有着无穷的活力和勇气……
