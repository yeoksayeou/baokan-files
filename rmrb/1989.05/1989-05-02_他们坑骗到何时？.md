How Long Will They Continue to Cheat?

After reading the letter to the editor published on April 12 in the sixth edition of the People's Daily, titled "This Type of Street Vendor Should Be Strictly Rectified, and They Should Not Be Allowed to Tarnish the Capital," I deeply felt that the people's newspaper and the people's journalists are truly serving the people and speaking for the people.

These days, I have been thinking, why, during the National People's Congress and the rectification and rectification period, was I cheated out of 14 yuan for eating a piece of watermelon in Beijing? It was April 1, and after getting off the train, I and my child passed by the Beijing Zoo on our way to the Central Party School's relatives' residence. A young female street vendor in a white shirt was shouting, "Eat watermelon, eat watermelon, 2.5 jiao per piece (each)." My child was thirsty and wanted to eat watermelon, misunderstanding it as 2.5 jiao per piece, handed over 3 jiao and took a piece of watermelon. The female vendor did not say how much it weighed or how much it cost after weighing it. When I came back to ask how much this piece of watermelon cost, she still did not tell me, only saying, "2.5 jiao per piece (each)." She spoke vaguely about the weight, and cut a bit of the skin off the watermelon, indicating that even if we did not eat it, it was ours. The female vendor handed the watermelon to my child. At this time, a plump middle-aged "female customer" came over, picked up a piece of watermelon, and after weighing it, the vendor demanded 15 yuan. The middle-aged "female customer" paid the money on the spot and ate the watermelon, very smoothly. Later, I realized they were in cahoots, setting up a scam. Then, the female vendor pressed the calculator and demanded 14.8 yuan from us. At that time, seeing them holding the watermelon knife, I was also afraid of taking a loss, knowing I was being cheated, but I had to pay up.

These vendors' cheating behavior is no different from robbery. Why are they so brazen in broad daylight? I don't know when these illegal vendors' cheating behavior will be stopped? Don't they fear breaking the law?

I hope the newspaper will continue to report on the investigation and handling of the case.

### 他们坑骗到何时？

　　他们坑骗到何时？
    看了４月１２日人民日报第六版刊登的信访调查《这类摊商应严加整顿，不许他们给首都抹黑》，深深感到人民的报纸、人民的记者是为人民服务、为人民说话的。
    这些天来，我总是想着，为什么在全国人代会召开期间，在治理、整顿的形势下，在北京吃一块西瓜却被坑骗了１４元钱？那是４月１日，我和孩子下了火车去中央党校亲属处路过动物园时，一穿白上衣的年轻女商贩嘴里喊着：“吃瓜、吃瓜，两毛五１克（颗）。”我的孩子口渴想吃西瓜，误听成两毛五１颗，便掏出了３角钱，拿起1块瓜。女商贩过秤后也不说多少份量多少钱，待我随后追来问这块瓜多少钱时，她仍不告知，只是说：“两毛五１克（颗）。”克、颗说的含糊不清，并把这块瓜用刀削去一点皮，表示这块瓜不吃也是我们的。女商贩把瓜递给我孩子。这时过来一胖胖的中年“女顾客”，拿起１块西瓜，过秤后商贩要１５元，那中年“女顾客”当场付了钱把瓜吃了，非常痛快。后来我发现他们是一伙的，是搞骗局。接着，女商贩一按计算器，要我们付１４．８元钱，当时，我看他们手里拿着切瓜刀，也怕吃眼前亏，明知坑骗，也只好照付。
    这些摊商的坑骗行为和抢劫没什么两样，为什么他们光天化日之下如此猖狂？不知何时才能制止这些不法商贩的坑骗行为？难道他们不怕违法吗？
    希望报纸能继续报道查处结果。
