In 1988, the cultural system of Zibo City, Shandong Province, adhered to reform and innovation, achieving remarkable results in institutional reform, artistic production, and self-financing through cultural activities. At the beginning of 1988, Zibo City formulated the "Comprehensive Reform Plan for the Cultural System," implementing term-based target responsibility systems, contract-based management responsibility systems, and appointment systems in all 18 affiliated units. This initiative boosted the enthusiasm of cadres and staff, liberated and developed cultural productivity, and yielded significant benefits.

Over the past year, the city created 55 scripts of various types. Among these, 7 were published in national-level journals, 3 were adapted into television episodes and distributed nationally and internationally, and 4 were performed by professional theater troupes. Actors from various professional theater troupes in the city won 3 national-level awards, 7 provincial-level awards, and 45 municipal-level awards. Notably, Ho Junping from the Zibo Five-Tone Theater Troupe received the highest honor in the Chinese theater industry, the "Plum Blossom Award." In July 1988, at the national "Self-Financing through Cultural Activities" experience exchange conference held in Beijing, the Zibo City Cultural Bureau was awarded the "National Advanced Unit for Self-Financing through Cultural Activities" by the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Finance, becoming one of the seven city-level cultural bureaus in the country to receive this honor.

Additionally, the city achieved notable successes in film and television video distribution, cultural relic surveys, library work, and amateur creation.
