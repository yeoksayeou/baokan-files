According to the police, in 1988, 800,000 people were found to have participated in gambling. Last year, a total of 215,000 gambling-related public security cases were handled nationwide, an increase of 24.8% compared to 1987; those punished for gambling accounted for 33.6% of all those punished. All these signs indicate that the gambling craze is spreading throughout society.

Gambling activities have been around for a long time, but unlike the past when gambling was hidden and clandestine, today's gambling activities have moved from the shadows into the open, from being hidden to being public. In hotels, tea houses, at train stations, docks, streets, and alleys, gambling activities can often be seen. Being open and brazen is the first characteristic of today's gambling activities.

Currently, the forms of gambling that are spreading are diverse and numerous. Traditional methods such as playing mahjong, poker, and pushing nine cards remain popular, while new methods like guessing the number of pencils, setting up chess puzzles, playing electronic games, guessing the heads or tails of coins, and guessing the odd or even numbers on banknotes are emerging one after another. A police officer from the Propaganda Department of the Zhengzhou Public Security Bureau introduced that two young men once bet on whether the license plate number of a distant car was odd or even, and within just a few seconds, thousands of yuan changed hands from one person's pocket to another.

According to the police, large bets are another characteristic of today's gambling activities. In the past, bets were usually a few yuan or tens of yuan; now, bets of hundreds or thousands of yuan are quite common. In 1988, several gambling cases with cumulative bets of nearly 100 million yuan were uncovered nationwide.

The scope of participants in gambling is also expanding. In the past, the term "gambling" was often associated with the unemployed, idle, and lazy. Now, participants in gambling include workers, farmers, students, and cadres. In terms of age structure, in the past, the main participants were middle-aged and young people, but now, the number of elderly and juvenile gamblers is also rising sharply. More seriously, some of the gamblers are party members and leaders, which has a bad influence. In a major gambling case uncovered in a certain county in Hubei last year, out of the 22 participants, 14 were party members, including the district committee secretary, deputy secretary, police station director, and deputy director of the court. They used public vehicles to transport gamblers 69 times and spent 70,000 yuan in public funds. In a gambling case uncovered in the Atung District of Shenyang City, there were 6 party members and cadres, and the gambling venue was in the home of a certain factory director. It cannot be denied that many people initially sat down at the mahjong table for excitement and entertainment. However, many people became complacent and got trapped, unable to extricate themselves.

Legal experts believe that gambling is a breeding ground for crime. There are countless examples of people committing theft, fraud, and even murder due to gambling debts. Some people are addicted to gambling, unrepentant, and destroy their own happy families. On December 31 last year, Song Shaowen, the director of the Hunan Provincial Drama Troupe, jumped to his death due to gambling debts of 350,000 yuan.

Why has the gambling craze arisen and why does it persist despite repeated bans? According to analysis, there are several reasons:

- Weak ideological and political education. Many units emphasize economic benefits one-sidedly, and ideological and political education has been relaxed. Many people only know how to make money and lack lofty ideals, spending their leisure time playing mahjong. In addition, under the trend of pursuing material wealth in society, the idea of "getting something for nothing" has emerged, and some people hope to get rich through gambling. Spiritual decline is the first factor in the prevalence of gambling activities.

- Monotonous leisure cultural life. A survey report by the Henan Provincial Urban Sampling Survey Team on the leisure cultural life of some workers, cadres, and intellectual families in Zhengzhou City shows: "The most frequent and highest proportion of activities in residents' nightlife is watching TV and reading newspapers, reaching 82%. Although TV is loved by the majority of residents, most viewers are dissatisfied with those boring and lengthy advertisements and the artificial and laughable TV dramas." "Monotonous nightlife, narrow social circle, and poor public entertainment facilities have become a potential factor hindering social development." With the improvement of material living standards, the spiritual and cultural needs of the masses are also becoming increasingly broad, and the lack of spiritual and cultural life restricts people's choices.

- Incomplete existing anti-gambling regulations. According to the police, currently, those caught gambling can only be educated according to the public security punishment regulations, fined and released, or at most subjected to re-education through labor, with light sentences. In a certain quarter of Quanzhou City, Fujian Province last year, 40% of the 669 gamblers caught were "repeat offenders."

- The atmosphere of joint social management has not yet formed. As a social disease, the gambling craze exposes problems far beyond gambling activities themselves. Now, "when the public security police take action, gambling activities quiet down," and the public security organs are fighting alone, making it difficult to curb this black whirlwind. To stop the gambling craze caused by various social factors, it is necessary to form an atmosphere of joint social management and rely on the joint efforts of the whole society.

To curb the gambling craze, comprehensive management is needed, and targeted work must be carried out. Only by persevering can the anti-gambling work achieve real results.

　　蔓延的赌风
    郑宏范　余清楚
    据警方透露，１９８８年查出参加赌博人员达８０万之多。去年，全国共查处赌博治安案件２１．５万余起，比１９８７年上升２４．８％；因赌博受到治安处罚的人次占全部处罚人次的３３．６％。种种迹象表明：赌博风正在社会上蔓延。
    赌博活动由来已久，但是，与过去窝赌、藏赌不同，现在的赌博活动已由暗处转到明处，由隐蔽变成为公开。在旅店茶社，在车船码头、街头巷尾，赌博活动时有所见。明目张胆是目前赌博活动的第一个特点。
    眼下蔓延的赌博活动形式不一，花样繁多。传统的打麻将、玩扑克牌、推牌九等方式经久不衰，新的套铅笔、摆象棋残局、玩电子游戏、猜硬币正反、纸币编号猜单双等赌法又层出不穷。郑州市公安局宣教处一位民警介绍说，有两位青年曾指着远处驶来的汽车，以其牌照号码是单数还是双数做赌，仅十几秒钟，上千元人民币便由甲的口袋流到了乙的囊中。
    据警方介绍，赌注大是眼下赌博活动的又一特点。过去多是以几元、十几元做底；现在，百元、千元做赌的已很常见。１９８８年，全国查获多起累计赌注近百万元的赌博案。
    参赌人员的范围也在日渐扩大。以前，“赌博”二字往往只是与无业人员、游手好闲和好吃懒做者有缘。眼下，参加赌博的，既有工人、农民，又有学生、干部。从年龄结构分析，以前以中青年为主，如今，老年、少年染赌人数也在扶摇直上。更为严重的是，赌博者当中，有些是党员和领导干部，影响恶劣。湖北某县去年破获的一起重大赌博案中，参赌的２２人当中，党员１４人，其中，还有区委正副书记、派出所所长和指导员、法庭副庭长等人。他们先后用公车接送聚赌６９次，用去公款７万元。沈阳市于洪区查出的一团伙赌博案中，有党员干部６人，赌博地点在某厂长的家中。不可否认，许多人是想寻刺激，抱着娱乐的初衷坐到麻将牌前的。结果，不少人麻痹大意，陷入其中，不可自拔。
    法律界有关人士认为，赌博是滋生犯罪的温床。因赌博欠债而去偷盗、诈骗，甚至造成凶杀等恶性案件的例子已举不胜举。还有的人赌博成性，不思悔改，美满幸福的家庭毁于自己之手。去年１２月３１日，湖南省话剧团导演宋绍文因赌博欠债３．５万元，跳楼自杀。
    蔓延的赌风因何而起？为何屡禁不止？据分析有以下几个原因：
    ——思想教育工作薄弱。许多单位片面地强调经济效益，思想教育工作有所放松。不少人只知挣钱，没有远大理想，业余时间打麻将消磨时光。另外，在社会上追求物质财富的潮流下，“不劳而获”思想有所抬头，有些人企望赌博发财致富。精神颓废是赌博活动盛行的第一因素。
    ——业余文化生活单调。河南省城市抽样调查队曾对郑州市部分工人、干部、知识分子家庭的业余文化生活状况做的调查报告表明：“居民夜生活最频繁、人数比例最高的活动便是看电视、读报纸，比例达８２％。尽管电视受到广大居民的喜爱，但大多数观众对那些乏味冗长的广告和说教做作、令人哭笑不得的电视剧最感不满。”“夜生活单调、社交面狭窄、公共娱乐设施贫乏，已成为阻碍社会发展的一个潜在因素。”随着物质生活水平的提高，群众的精神文化需求内容也愈来愈广，贫乏的精神文化生活限制了人们的选择。
    ——现行禁赌法规不够完善。据警方反映，现在抓到赌博者只能依照治安处罚条例教育一番，罚款放掉，最多也就是实行劳动教养，量刑偏轻。福建泉州市鲤城区去年某季度抓获的６６９名参赌人员中，４０％是“二进宫”。
    ——社会共管风气尚未形成。作为社会病，赌博风暴露的问题远在赌博活动本身之外。现在是“公安干警一出动，赌博活动静一静”，公安机关孤军作战，难以扼制这股黑色旋风。刹住由诸多社会因素导致的赌博风，需要形成社会共管风气，依靠全社会的共同努力。
    扼制赌博风需要实行综合治理，有的放矢地开展工作。只有坚持不懈，禁赌工作才能收到实效。
