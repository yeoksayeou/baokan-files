Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 17th.

A joint investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Washington Egg Nutrition Center has confirmed that the cholesterol content in eggs is 22% lower than previously thought.

During this one-year investigation, 2,500 eggs from various parts of the United States were tested. The results showed that an average-sized egg contains 213 milligrams of dietary cholesterol, significantly lower than the 274 milligrams reported in 1976.

The investigation also confirmed that the average fat content per egg is 5 grams, slightly lower than previous results. Eggs are considered a low-calorie food, providing protein, vitamin A, vitamin B12, iron, zinc, riboflavin, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and other nutrients. On average, each egg contains 75 calories. Medical experts believe that the cholesterol levels in the human body are related to heart disease. For health reasons, the sales of eggs in the United States have been declining in recent years. Therefore, this new investigation result has been welcomed by the U.S. egg industry.

　　美再测定鸡蛋营养成分
    新华社北京５月１７日电  据外电报道，由美国农业部和华盛顿鸡蛋营养中心联合进行的一项调查证实，鸡蛋中所含的胆固醇比原先认为的数量低２２％。
    在这项为期一年的调查中，对来自美国各地的２５００枚鸡蛋进行了化验。调查发现，一枚平均大小的鸡蛋中含有２１３毫克食用胆固醇，这一结果明显少于１９７６年报告中提出的为２７４毫克的指标。
    调查还证实，每枚鸡蛋中平均脂肪总含量为５克，稍微低于以前的结果；鸡蛋是一种低热量的食物，可提供蛋白质、维生素Ａ、维生素Ｂ１２、铁、锌、核黄素、钙、磷、钾和其它营养物质，平均每枚鸡蛋的含热量为７５卡路里。医学家认为，人体的胆固醇含量与心脏病有关。出于健康的考虑，近年来美国的鸡蛋销量一直在下降，因此这一新的调查结果受到了美国鸡蛋工业界的欢迎。
