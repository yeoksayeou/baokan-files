	“We Aim to Win Four or Five Gold Medals”
		— Coach Xu Yiming Talks About the World Cup Diving Competition

	China's national diving team coach Xu Yiming confidently stated today that in tomorrow's opening of the sixth World Cup Diving Championships here, "We aim to win four or five gold medals."

	Xu Yiming, in an interview with our reporter at the Lincoln Hotel of Indiana University, said: "Our team has advantages in women's team, mixed team, men's and women's individual 3-meter springboard, and 10-meter platform events. As long as the athletes perform at their normal level and the judges are fair, winning four or five gold medals is possible."

	In last year's Olympics, the Chinese diving team won a total of 2 gold, 3 silver, and 1 bronze medals, ranking first in the total number of medals. However, the men's and women's 1-meter springboard events, which were newly added to this World Cup, are China's weak points.

	This event has been developed in the United States for over 30 years, and Soviet athletes have also trained for many years, while China has only started for two or three years. Xu Yiming said that in the Guangzhou International Diving Championships held in early April, although the Chinese team also won the men's and women's 1-meter springboard championships, many foreign strong athletes did not participate at that time. It will be very difficult for the Chinese team to win in the host country's strong event.

	What worries Xu Yiming the most is that the physical condition of the Chinese diving team members is obviously not as good as it was during the Seoul Olympics. He said that after the Olympics, many team members have gained weight, and many team members have injuries. Xiong Ni's waist injury has not healed yet, Tan Liangde recently had otitis media, and Zhang Yuping's old foot injury has not recovered. These factors have affected the recent training.

	The Chinese diving team arrived in Indianapolis via Los Angeles on the 29th, and they only had 3 days for adaptation training. When asked by the reporter if the athletes could adapt to the time difference, Xu Yiming told the reporter that they have a lot of experience in adjusting to time differences. They use mandatory measures, strictly not allowing team members to sleep during the day, and must go to bed at 10 PM at night.

	After two or three days, the time difference has basically been adjusted, and the training has basically reached the expected goal.

### “我们争取拿四五块金牌”——徐益明总教练谈世界杯跳水赛

　　“我们争取拿四五块金牌”   
     ——徐益明总教练谈世界杯跳水赛
    中国跳水队总教练徐益明今天颇有信心地说，在明天于这里开幕的第六届世界杯跳水赛上，“我们争取拿四五块金牌”。
    徐益明在其下榻的印第安纳大学林肯旅馆接受本社记者专访时说：“中国队在女子团体、男女混合团体、男女个人３米跳板和１０米跳台方面都有优势，只要队员能发挥正常水平，裁判公正，拿下四五块金牌是有希望的。”
    中国跳水队在去年奥运会上共获２金３银１铜６块奖牌，奖牌总数居首位。但是，本届世界杯赛新设的男、女１米跳板却是中国的弱项。
    这个项目美国已开展了３０多年，苏联选手也练了多年，而中国起步才两三年。徐益明说，在４月上旬举行的广州国际跳水赛上，中国队虽然也拿了男、女１米跳板冠军，但当时有好些国外强手没有参加。中国队要在东道主选手擅长的项目上获胜“是很难的”。
    最使徐益明担心的是，中国跳水队员目前的身体素质明显不如汉城奥运会期间。他说，奥运会后，许多队员都长胖了，不少队员身上有伤，熊倪腰伤至今未愈，谭良德不久前患中耳炎，张玉萍脚板老伤一直未好。这些对前一段的训练是有影响的。
    中国跳水队是２９日经由洛杉矶飞抵印城的，他们的适应性训练时间只有３天。记者问徐教练，运动员能否适应时差，徐益明告诉记者，他们倒时差已经很有经验了，就是采取强制性措施，白天坚决不让队员睡觉，晚上１０点必须上床。
    两三天下来，时差基本倒过来了，训练基本达到了预期的目标。
