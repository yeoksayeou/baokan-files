The Democratic Party and the People's Party also unanimously demanded that former President Chun Doo-hwan and Choi Kyu-ha testify in court.

Republican Party Chairman Kim Jong-pil expressed dissatisfaction with the government's delay in resolving existing problems. He also agreed with the opposition parties, including the People's Party, on the issue of the current cabinet's resignation.
