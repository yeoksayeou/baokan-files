Currently, African countries are facing numerous challenges, including slow economic growth, heavy debt burdens, increasing fiscal deficits, and severe inflation. What is the urgent task to reverse this economic difficulty? This was a key topic discussed recently at the "International Symposium on Development Strategies for Third World Countries" held in Beijing.

During the conference, a reporter visited Professor Bernard Husson, a renowned French economist.

Professor Husson is the director of the Lyon Institute of Social Research and has conducted extensive and in-depth studies on the economic issues of African countries.

He is open and eloquent. When asked by the reporter, he firmly stated: "Third World countries should prioritize agricultural development." "African countries should especially prioritize food production to solve the problem of people's food security." The self-sufficiency rate of food in African countries was 98% in 1960, but it dropped to 70% by the late 1970s, and by the mid-1980s, it was only 50%. The number of countries that were self-sufficient in food decreased from 25 to 10 between 1960 and 1980, while the number of countries facing food shortages or severe food shortages increased from 30 to 45. The main reason for this situation is that the annual growth rate of food production in Africa is about 2%, while the annual population growth rate is 3.2%. Therefore, the per capita food growth rate in Africa has been declining for many years, sometimes even showing negative growth. As a result, the amount of food imported each year has been increasing, reaching six times the amount in the 1960s by the early 1980s, with at least 300 million tons of rice imported annually. The severe situation tells African countries that developing food production should be the priority within agricultural development. In this regard, Professor Husson believes that developing agricultural production involves a series of difficult problems to solve, but the most important issue is to have both an agricultural policy and a corresponding food supply policy, that is, to produce food for residents, build warehouses to store food, and develop transportation to distribute food from one region to another. Without a food supply policy that closely aligns with agricultural policy, agricultural policy cannot be implemented, and any agricultural development plan will be ineffective.

Developing agriculture requires funds, but how can African countries raise these funds? Professor Husson said: "We must vigorously develop savings in rural areas and establish a very modern savings and credit system. The masses need to learn to manage finances and develop commodity production. We need to mobilize the masses to save money, even if it is a small amount, to invest in production and create new job opportunities." "Of course," Professor Husson said humorously, "I am not against women buying a dress to wear."

Some African countries, such as Côte d'Ivoire, have achieved miraculous economic development by relying on the export of cash crops like cocoa and coffee. However, due to the significant drop in international market prices for primary products, their economies have encountered enormous difficulties. Regarding this, Professor Husson sighed: "In the process of prioritizing agricultural development, African countries also need to develop export-oriented agricultural products, but they must not base their economic development on dependence on export-oriented agriculture."

When discussing the outflow of rural populations, Professor Husson said: "Prioritizing agricultural development means developing both agricultural production and rural industries in rural areas to keep the rural population in their hometowns and prevent them from easily migrating to cities." Why do rural populations migrate to cities in large numbers? Professor Husson believes, "The price of agricultural products is too low, and farmers' incomes are insufficient, making cities attractive to farmers. If the price of agricultural products is raised and farmers' incomes increase, people will no longer want to leave their hometowns."

　　非洲应优先发展农业
    ——访法国著名经济学家贝尔纳·于松教授
    本报记者  杨贵兰
    当前，非洲国家面临着生产发展缓慢、外债负担沉重、财政赤字增加、通货膨胀严重等诸多问题。什么是扭转经济困难局面的当务之急？这是不久前在北京举行的“第三世界国家发展战略国际讨论会”的一个重要议题。
    会议期间，记者就这个问题造访了法国著名经济学家贝尔纳·于松教授。
    于松教授现为里昂社会研究学院院长，对非洲国家的经济问题有过广泛深入的研究。
    他开朗健谈，当记者提问后，便斩钉截铁地说：“第三世界国家应该优先发展农业。”“非洲国家更要优先发展粮食生产，解决人们的吃饭问题。”非洲国家的粮食自给率在一九六○年为百分之九十八，七十年代末下降至百分之七十，而八十年代上半期则只有百分之五十了。粮食自给的国家在一九六○至一九八○年的二十年间由二十五个减至十个，缺粮和严重缺粮的国家由三十个增至四十五个。造成这一现象的主要原因在于：非洲的粮食年增长率约为百分之二，而人口年增长率为百分之三点二，因此，非洲人均粮食年增长率多年来一直呈下降趋势，有时还呈负增长。于是，粮食进口量逐年增加，八十年代初期是六十年代的六倍，仅大米一项每年进口不少于三百万吨。严峻的形势告诉非洲各国：发展粮食生产应是农业优先中的优先。在这方面，于松教授认为，发展农业生产有一系列棘手问题要解决，但最重要的问题是既要有农业政策，又要有与之相配合的食品供应政策，即要生产居民食用的粮食，建造贮存粮食的仓库调剂余缺，发展交通运输业将此区的粮食运到彼区。没有与农业政策密切配合的食品供应政策，农业政策就无法落实，任何农业发展规划也就将一事无成。
    发展农业需要资金，但非洲国家如何筹措资金？于松先生说：“要在农村大力发展储蓄事业，建立很现代化的储蓄—信贷体系。群众要学会管理财务，发展商品生产。要动员群众将钱、将哪怕是一笔数额不大的钱投入储蓄，用来发展生产，创造新的就业岗位”，“当然，”于松教授诙谐地说：“我并不反对妇女买一条袍子穿穿。”
    非洲一些国家如科特迪瓦，曾依靠发展可可、咖啡等出口创汇农作物取得奇迹般的经济发展。而今，由于初级产品的国际市场价格大幅度下跌，它们的经济都遇到了巨大困难。对此，于松教授不无感慨地说：“非洲国家在优先发展农业的过程中，也需要发展出口创汇农业，但是决不能把国家的经济发展建立在依赖出口创汇农业的基础上。”
    谈及农村人口外流时，于松先生说：“优先发展农业，就是要在农村既发展农业生产，又发展乡镇工业，以便将农村人口尽量固定在他们出生的故乡而不使其轻易流入城市。”农村人口为什么会大量流入城市？于松教授认为，“农产品价格太低，农民收入少，城市就对农民有吸引力。若将农产品价格提高，农民收入增加，人们就不再想离开自己的故乡了。”
