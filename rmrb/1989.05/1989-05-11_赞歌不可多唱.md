	Praise Should Not Be Overdone
	Yu Ronghui, Qian Dongnan Prefecture Civil Affairs Bureau, Guizhou Province

	The low economic efficiency of many enterprises in our country is largely due to backward management and the lack of a scientific management mechanism. With the economic system reform, the emergence of contract-based employment, full-load work system, selection-based employment, and optimization of personnel allocation has struck at the root of issues like the "iron rice bowl," and has been widely praised.

	However, it is worth noting that if we emphasize these aspects one-sidedly, it is easy to have a flavor of economic coercion. In order to improve economic efficiency, people are sometimes treated as objects to be allocated and manipulated, neglecting the human touch in management.

	Workers are rational, emotional, and have complex psychological needs. The efficiency of enterprise production depends not only on the working conditions of the staff but also on their work morale. Emphasizing supervision and prevention is not wrong, but it is more important to emphasize the incentive mechanism. After World War II, the sustained economic development of Western countries was partly due to the humanistic behavior school, which effectively reconciled labor-capital conflicts, stimulated workers' enthusiasm, and improved labor productivity.

	The most active and dynamic factor in the production forces is people. Understanding, caring for, and respecting the staff, and organically unifying the authority of managers with the master status of the staff, is what a socialist enterprise should have and is also an important condition for improving labor efficiency. Relying solely on material rewards or disciplinary punishments to maintain authority and enhance the staff's work enthusiasm is, at least, not a mature and modern-minded enterprise manager.

	Two nationwide surveys by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions show that nearly half of the workers' enthusiasm has not been fully utilized. One of the main reasons is that the workers' master status is not guaranteed, leading to various degrees of loss, panic, and anxiety. This is largely due to some factory directors and managers not paying enough attention to protecting the legal rights of workers in terms of work, rest, labor protection, and labor remuneration.

	The imbalance in China's economic development and the diversity of economic components make it possible to find examples that are superior and reasonable for every idea, method, and measure. However, for those measures and methods that emphasize punishment over incentives and prevention over participation, I think we should not sing too many praises. Moreover, if we apply a "one-size-fits-all" approach nationwide, it is inevitable that many people will misinterpret the scriptures. We have already suffered enough from this aspect.

　　赞歌不可多唱
    贵州省黔东南州民政局  禹荣辉
    我国不少企业经济效益低下，重要的原因在于管理落后，缺少科学的管理机制。伴随着经济体制改革而出现的合同制用工，满负荷工作法，选聘制以及优化组合等，因击中了“大锅饭”等“积弊”，受到普遍好评。
    值得注意的是，片面强调这些，就难免带有一些经济强制的味道，甚至为提高经济效益而把人当作物来配置操纵，忽视了管理中的人情味等。
    工人是有理智的、有情感、有复杂心理的。企业生产效率的高低，不仅取决于职工的工作条件，也取决于职工的工作情绪。强调监督防范并不错，但更要重视鼓励机制。二次大战之后，西方国家经济得以持续发展，与人道主义行为学派能较好地调和劳资矛盾、刺激工人积极性而提高劳动生产率不能说没有关系。
    生产力要素中最积极、最活跃的是人。理解、关心、尊重职工，把管理者的权威和职工群众的主人翁地位有机地统一，这是社会主义企业应有之举，也是提高劳动效率的重要条件。仅靠物质奖励或纪律处罚等消极措施来维系自己的权威和提高职工的劳动热情，至少算不上一个成熟的、具有现代意识的企业家。
    全国总工会的两次调查表明，有近一半职工的劳动积极性没有发挥，重要原因之一就是职工的主人翁地位没有保障，产生种种程度的失落、恐慌、忧虑感。而这很大的程度上又是部分厂长、经理不重视维护职工工作、休息、劳动保护、劳动报酬等合法权益所致。
    我国经济发展的不平衡和经济成份的多样性，使每项设想、办法、措施都可以找到其优越合理的例子。但对那些处罚多于激励、防范多于参与的措施和办法，我以为不可多唱赞歌。何况全国“一刀切”，免不了又有许多人大念特念“歪经”。我们吃过这方面的亏已经不少了。
