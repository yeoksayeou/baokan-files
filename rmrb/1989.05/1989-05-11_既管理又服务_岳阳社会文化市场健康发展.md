Yueyang City in Hunan Province has been both managing and serving the social and cultural market, ensuring that operators benefit legally and the market develops healthily, thereby improving the cultural leisure life of its citizens.

In recent years, the social and cultural market in Yueyang, a city with a population of 400,000, has developed rapidly. According to incomplete statistics, the city currently has 24 commercial dance halls, 11 music tea houses, 112 video screening rooms, 789 billiard rooms, 136 newspaper and book stalls, 57 amusement parks, and 140 other entertainment venues.

To strengthen management, Yueyang City and its various counties and districts have established social and cultural market management stations and issued a series of local regulations and documents. At the beginning of this year, they also set up cultural inspection teams in various levels of management stations, transforming the originally purely administrative management bodies into law enforcement teams. This has eliminated the problems of multiple agencies (public security, commerce, taxation, culture, and broadcasting) managing the same issues, sometimes overlapping and sometimes leaving gaps, and has also resolved the conflict between professional personnel lacking authority to manage and non-professional personnel lacking the ability to manage. In 1988, Yueyang City seized 17,500 illegal printed materials, 67 boxes of pornographic audio-visual products, 34 gambling tools, and stopped 24 illegal printing operations, reducing the number of fights and brawls by 67% compared to 1987.

At the same time, Yueyang City has included service in the work agenda of various levels of social and cultural management stations. They believe that approval and inspection are not the only means to establish the authority of managers. Serving the operators and gaining their trust and support can also be effective. They allocate specific locations for cultural market operators, providing them with relatively ideal operating venues and encouraging them to engage in civilized competition and improve service quality. The area around Dongfeng Square in Yueyang originally had only one dance hall operated by the Workers' Club, with poor facilities and some service issues. Later, the Yueyang Social and Cultural Market Management Station encouraged the nearby Qunfeng Restaurant to also operate a dance hall, attracting many customers with its good service attitude and facilities, forcing the Workers' Club to improve its service and conditions.

The management experience of Yueyang's social and cultural market has recently been fully affirmed by the leadership of the Ministry of Culture.

### 既管理又服务  岳阳社会文化市场健康发展

　　既管理又服务    
    岳阳社会文化市场健康发展
    新华社北京电（记者邵建武）湖南省岳阳市对社会文化市场既管理又服务，使经营者合法得利，文化市场健康发展，市民的业余文化生活有了改善。
    ４０万人口的岳阳市近年来社会文化市场发展迅速。据不完全统计，这个市目前有营业性舞厅２４个，音乐茶座１１家，录相放映厅１１２家，桌球室７８９个，报刊书摊１３６处，游乐场５７个，其他娱乐项目１４０处。
    为了加强管理，岳阳市及所辖各县、区相继成立了社会文化市场管理站，颁发了一系列地方法规和文件。今年初，他们又在各级管理站挂出了文化稽查队的牌子，使原来单纯的行政管理机构兼为执法队伍，消除了公安、工商、税务、文化、广播多头管理，有时重复，有时空档的现象，也解决了专业人员无权管理，非专业人员无力管理的矛盾。１９８８年，岳阳市共收缴非法印刷品１７５００多册，黄色音像制品６７盒，赌博工具３４件，制止非法印刷２４起，打架斗殴事件比１９８７年减少６７％。
    与此同时，岳阳市把服务列入了各级社会文化管理站的工作日程中。他们认为，审批、查处并不是树立管理者威信的唯一手段，为经营者服务，取得经营者的信任和支持，可以说有异曲同工之美。他们给文化市场经营者定点定位，既使他们有比较理想的经营场地，又促使他们开展文明竞争，提高服务质量。岳阳市东风广场一带，原来只有工人俱乐部一家经营舞厅，设施较差，服务也有一些问题。后来，岳阳市社会文化市场管理站鼓励离这里不远的群芳酒楼也经营舞厅，以良好的服务态度和设施吸引了不少人，迫使工人俱乐部不得不改善自己的服务和条件。
    岳阳社会文化市场管理的经验，最近得到文化部领导的充分肯定。
