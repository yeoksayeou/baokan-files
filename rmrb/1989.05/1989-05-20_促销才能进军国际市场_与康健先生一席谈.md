In modern society, when people purchase goods, they are often influenced by various buying psychology factors. The market is far from simply being a place where you sell and I buy, or you produce and I sell. If Chinese products are to enter the international market and establish a foothold, businesspeople and managers must have a promotional mindset.

This is the view expressed by Mr. Kang Jian, President of the American company Ke Li Si, when discussing how to develop an export-oriented economy with the authors.

In recent years, Mr. Kang Jian has been dedicated to promoting Sino-American trade. When talking about promotion, he combines the rigor of economics with simplicity and precision.

In international commercial competition, there is a formula:

Sales revenue equals the number of fixed customers multiplied by the number of purchases multiplied by the unit price.

Those currently engaged in international trade in China often focus on negotiating prices with foreign businesses, which means they only emphasize the third item in the formula, the "unit price," and do not truly understand market capture and competition.

China's well-known brand, Tsingtao Beer, is in no way inferior to any beer on the American market in terms of quality and price. However, after setting the goal of entering the American market, it took ten years to gain entry. Later, by hiring an American agent for sales, the sales volume increased by twenty percent annually. In 1988, the annual sales volume in the American market reached 1.4 million cases, with a total value exceeding $20 million, becoming a best-seller in the American market.

Mr. Kang Jian's children's bicycle business is similar. Ke Li Si Company, as an agent for several factories in Henan, successfully entered the mid-to-low-end market in the United States with children's bicycles. With a monthly sales volume of dozens of containers, the bicycles continuously entered the American market, becoming the largest wholesaler of children's bicycles in the Los Angeles market.

Promotion generally consists of the following parts:

Promotion network: In the United States and some other Western countries, this network is often linked with supermarkets, chain stores, and flea markets.

Promotion professionals: They are composed of market research personnel, salespeople, advertising and packaging designers, and some retailers.

Promotion methods: Such as advertising, publicity, trials, design, forecasting, and after-sales service, etc.

Additionally, market research, feedback, and redesigning and adjusting new designs are required.

Mr. Kang Jian said that to complete such an action, a strong team is needed, and individual efforts by a single enterprise are not enough. To help domestic products adapt to international market competition, Ke Li Si Company is willing to provide opportunities for domestic manufacturers to export and participate in international competition. At the same time, it also hopes to introduce the concept of promotion to Chinese manufacturers and relevant departments.

　　促销才能进军国际市场
    ——与康健先生一席谈
    徐方　张书新
    现代社会里，当人们购买商品时，常常会受到各式各样购买心理的影响。市场已远远不是你卖我买，你产我销这样简单。中国产品如想进入国际市场，并且站住脚，企业家和经营者一定要有促销的观念。
    这是美国凯立斯公司总裁康健先生在与笔者谈到如何发展外向型经济时发表的看法。
    康健先生近年来致力于发展中美贸易。谈起促销来，既体现了经济学的严谨，又深入浅出、一语中的。
    在国际商业竞争中，有这样一个公式：
    商品销售额等于固定客户数乘以购买次数乘以单价。
    国内目前从事国际贸易的人，往往把注意力集中和外商讨价还价上，也就是只重视公式的第三项“单价”的高低，对占领市场和竞争，并没有真正了解。
    我国的名牌产品青岛啤酒，无论是品质还是价格，绝不逊色于美国市场上任何一种啤酒。然而，在确立进入美国市场的目标后，曾经十年之久不得入其门。后来请一美商作为销售代理，销量以每年百分之二十的幅度增长，一九八八年在美国市场的年销量达一百四十万箱。总值超过二千万美元，成为美国市场的畅销货。
    康健先生做的儿童自行车生意也是如此。凯立斯公司作为河南几家厂商的代理，成功地将这种儿童自行车打入美国中、低档市场，并以每月十几个集装箱的销售量，源源进入美国市场，成为洛杉矶市场上最大的儿童自行车批发商。
    促销业一般由这样几个部分组成：
    促销网络：在美国及其他一些西方国家，这种网络往往和超级市场、连锁店、跳蚤市场联系在一起。
    促销专业人员：他们由市场调查人员、推销人员、广告和包装设计人员及一部分零售商组成。
    促销手段：如广告、宣传、试用、设计、预测及售后服务等。
    另外，还要开展市场调查、反馈后重新设计、调整新设计等等。
    康健先生说，要完成这样一个行动，需一个强大的阵容，单靠个别企业的努力是不行的。为了使国内产品适应国际市场竞争，凯立斯公司愿为国内厂家产品出口、参与国际竞争提供机会，同时，也希望依此把促销的概念介绍给中国厂家及有关部门。
