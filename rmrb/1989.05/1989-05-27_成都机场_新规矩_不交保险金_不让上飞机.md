	"Please note, passengers boarding China Civil Aviation flights: In addition to having your ID and ticket, you must also have your personal and luggage insurance documents. Otherwise, you may miss your flight." This is what the reporter heard upon entering the departure lounge on May 25 while boarding a China Civil Aviation flight from Chengdu to Beijing.

	Buying personal and luggage insurance before boarding a plane was something the reporter had not heard of before. There were no notices at the check-in counter either. However, on May 25, when the reporter was queuing to check in luggage and get a boarding pass, the staff at the counter pushed back the reporter's press card and ticket: "Go pay for your personal insurance." The reporter was taken aback: "Where?" The staff gestured with their mouth. Following the gesture, the reporter saw a small counter at the far end of the room with no signs, only money changing hands. Time was tight, so the reporter quickly took the luggage off the scale and squeezed to the personal insurance payment counter: "How much?" "Five yuan." After receiving the receipt for the "Domestic Aviation Personal Accident Insurance," the reporter returned to check in the luggage. But the staff at the counter spoke up again: "How many pieces of luggage?" "One." The reporter did not dare ask what the money was for and paid the three yuan. Another receipt was issued: "Domestic Aviation Luggage Transportation Insurance Voucher." Only then did the reporter finally receive the boarding pass.

	The entire process left the reporter in a sweat. However, it was not just the reporter who was not used to this new procedure. The departure lounge was buzzing with discussions: "This is just a way to collect extra money!" "A 411 yuan ticket doesn't even include personal and luggage insurance!" An elderly man with silver hair sighed, "I've been to Europe, America, Asia, and many other countries. Airline tickets in those countries include personal and luggage insurance. I've never seen them charge extra." A colleague from the media joked, "You got off easy, only 3 yuan for one piece of luggage. I had 4 pieces, that's 12 yuan!"

	At this point, a colleague from the Yunnan Civil Aviation Department chimed in, "This is a new policy implemented by the People's Insurance Company of China. It's voluntary for the passengers; if you want to pay, you pay; if you don't want to, you don't have to. I didn't pay." Hearing this, the reporter was puzzled again: Voluntary? The reporter was unsure how this colleague had "voluntarily" entered the departure lounge, while other passengers had paid the fee to get their boarding passes.

	The reporter pondered: Is the ticket price not high enough? Is it that without paying the new insurance fee, there is no guarantee of safety for personal and luggage?

### 成都机场“新规矩”——不交保险金　不让上飞机

　　成都机场“新规矩”——
    不交保险金　不让上飞机
    “请乘坐中国民航班机的旅客注意：在登机前除了要有身份证件和机票之外，还要手持人身保险和行李保险单据，否则会误时误事。”这是记者２５日由成都乘中国民航班机赴北京时一进候机室所听到的。
    乘飞机要另交人身和行李保险费，事先未闻；办理登机手续处也没看到任何告示。但２５日当本人排队托运行李和领取登机卡时，柜台里的工作人员却把我的记者证和机票推了回来：“去交人身保险金”。本人一愣：“到哪儿交？”对方用嘴一噘示意。我顺着嘴势看到屋内尽头处有一小柜台，没有任何文字标志，只见人民币在那里进进出出。时间紧迫，我赶紧从磅秤上拖下行李，挤到人身保险收款处问：“交多少钱？”“五元”。拿到《国内航空运输人身意外伤害保险单》收据后，我又返回去托运行李。可柜台内的那位工作人员又发话了：“几件行李？”答：“一件”。“交三元钱”。我没敢再问是什么钱，掏钱照付。又收到一张单据：《国内航空行李运输保险凭证》。到此，总算领到了登机卡。
    整个手续办完，一身大汗淋漓。不过，不适应这一新作法的并非我一人。候机厅里议论纷纷：“这简直是变相敛钱！”“４１１元的机票竟连人身和行李保险费用都不包括在内？！”一位发如银丝的长者感叹地说：“我到过欧、美、亚洲和许多国家，各国航空公司的机票都包含人身、行李保险金，从没见过另收费的。”一位新闻界同行戏谑地对我说：“你够便宜了，托运一件行李才３元钱。我是４件，三四壹拾二元大洋！”这时，大厅里一位在云南民航部门工作的同志插话说：“这是中国人民保险公司新实行的办法，随旅客自愿，愿交则交，不愿交可以不交，我就没交。”听后，我又是一愣：自愿？不知这位同志是怎么“自愿”进入候机厅的，其他旅客是在命令下交了费才拿到登机卡的。
    我在思索：是否机票价格上涨得还不够呢？是否不再交新的保险金，人身和行李就无安全保证呢？
