Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 22nd.

Warsaw Pact countries have called on NATO nations to simultaneously dissolve both the Warsaw Pact and NATO, the two opposing military blocs.

This was announced by Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov at a press conference on May 22nd.

The Warsaw Pact countries also proposed that all military armaments, including naval forces, be included in disarmament negotiations. They reiterated their proposal to begin separate talks on tactical nuclear weapons and called for the establishment of political dialogue between the two military blocs.

The appeal was issued ahead of the upcoming NATO summit in Brussels at the end of the month. NATO and the Warsaw Pact were established during the "Cold War" in 1949 and 1955, respectively. The Warsaw Pact countries believe that the simultaneous dissolution of these two organizations will help eliminate the remnants of the "Cold War" in Europe and the world.
