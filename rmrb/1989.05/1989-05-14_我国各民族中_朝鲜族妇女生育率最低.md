A survey indicates that among China's 56 ethnic groups, the total fertility rate and the proportion of multiple births among Korean women are the lowest in the country.

According to data from the Population Research Institute of Beijing Institute of Economics, since the implementation of family planning in the 1960s, the total fertility rate among Korean women has been gradually declining. In 1963, it was 6.71, dropping to 1.91 in 1981, and further decreasing to 1.85 in 1986. Since then, it has remained consistently below 2.0. The proportion of women giving birth to three or more children was as low as 8.98% in 1981, significantly lower than the 24.69% for Han women in the same period.

The successful implementation of family planning among Koreans is closely related to their emphasis on education and higher cultural literacy. Among Koreans, there are popular sayings such as "Fewer children, more education" and "Even if we starve tomorrow, we must send our children to school today." In 1987, the number of Korean college students accounted for 44.06‰ of the total population of the ethnic group.

　　我国各民族中    
    朝鲜族妇女生育率最低
    据新华社北京５月１４日电（实习生温闽）一项调查表明，我国５６个民族中，朝鲜族妇女的总和生育率、多胎生育比例在全国最低。
    据北京经济学院人口研究所提供的资料，从６０年代实行计划生育以来，朝鲜族妇女的总和生育率在逐渐下降，１９６３年为６．７１，１９８１年降到１．９１，１９８６年又降到１．８５，以后一直持续在２．０以下的低生育水平；生育３胎以上的早在１９８１年时就只占８．９８％，远远低于汉族同期的２４．６９％。
    计划生育开展的如此好是与朝鲜族对教育事业的重视、文化素质比较高分不开的。朝鲜族中普遍流传着这样一些俗语：“少生孩子多读书”、“哪怕明天就要饿死，今天也要送孩子上学”等。１９８７年朝鲜族在校大学生占全族人口的４４．０６‰。
