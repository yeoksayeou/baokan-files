Currently, some students have been on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square for four days, and some students' health has become very weak. The dialogue between the government and the representatives of the hunger-striking students did not yield results the day before yesterday, and the situation in Tiananmen Square is further escalating. Facing this situation, we feel extremely anxious and worried. As university presidents and teachers of the students, we are very concerned about the students' health and lives. We are also worried about the future of the country and do not want the process of reform, opening up, and modernization construction to be disrupted and interrupted in any way.

In the current situation, the correct choice can only be dialogue. Conducting constructive dialogue requires a calm, rational, and realistic attitude. In a situation where emotions are high and opinions are opposed, problems that could be solved will become difficult to resolve. We sincerely hope that the relevant parties and the relevant parties involved will exercise restraint and not further escalate the situation, so as to avoid regrettable and irreparable incidents.

The current situation in Tiananmen Square cannot continue any longer; this stalemate is not a solution. We hope that the main leaders of the Party and the government will meet and dialogue with the students as soon as possible. There is no fundamental conflict of interests between the vast number of students and the government. We believe that the patriotic enthusiasm and reasonable demands of the vast number of students to worry about the country and the people, to promote the reform process, and to eliminate corruption will be highly valued and seriously addressed by the Party and the government. As long as everyone has trust, understanding, sincerity, and patience, they will definitely find a positive and realistic way to solve the problem.

We sincerely hope that the vast number of students, teachers, and people from all walks of life, with a sense of responsibility for the life and health of the students on hunger strike and for the future of the country, will work together to guide the situation towards a rational and orderly direction, and not let the students pay unnecessary prices.

Currently, we, the 10 presidents, have contacted the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council and urgently reported the situation to the central leaders. We are willing to contact the representatives of the students on hunger strike from each school, reflect everyone's wishes and demands, and do the work of communication and liaison.

　　就北京一些学生绝食请愿    
    十位大学校长发表公开信
    目前，一些同学在天安门广场的静坐绝食已进入第四天，有些同学的身体已经非常虚弱。前天政府和绝食同学代表的对话没有取得结果，天安门广场的事态在进一步激化。面对这种形势，我们感到十分焦急和忧虑。作为大学的校长和同学们的老师，我们对同学们的健康和生命非常担心，我们也为国家的前途担忧，无论如何也不希望改革、开放和现代化建设的进程被打乱和中断。
    在当前的形势下，正确的选择只能是对话。进行建设性的对话，需要的是冷静、理智和现实主义的态度。在群情激昂、感情对立的情况下，本来可以解决的问题也会变得难以解决。我们真诚希望有关方面和有关的当事人保持克制，不要进一步激化事态，避免出现令人痛心的难以挽回的事情。
    目前，天安门广场上的情况不能再继续下去了，这样对峙下去总不是办法。我们希望党和政府的主要负责人尽快与同学们直接见面和对话。广大同学和政府之间没有根本的利害冲突，我们相信广大同学忧国忧民、希望推进改革进程、清除腐败现象的爱国热忱和合理要求会得到党和政府的高度重视和认真对待。只要大家有信任、谅解、诚意和耐心，一定能够找到一条积极解决问题的现实途径。
    我们真诚地希望广大同学、教师和社会各界人士，本着对参加绝食同学的生命健康负责、对国家前途负责的精神，共同努力，引导事态向着理智、秩序的方向发展，不要使同学们付出不必要的代价。
    目前，我们１０位校长已同党中央、国务院取得了联系，紧急向中央领导同志陈明情况。我们愿意同各校参加绝食的同学代表进行接触，反映大家的愿望和要求，做沟通和联系工作。
