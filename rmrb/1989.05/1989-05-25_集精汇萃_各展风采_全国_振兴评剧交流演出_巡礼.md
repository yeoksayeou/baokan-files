In May, Shenyang is at its most vibrant. The national “Revival of Pingju Opera Exchange Performance” held here has added to the springtime atmosphere. Starting from May 10th, the various theaters in Shenyang frequently displayed “Sold Out” signs, and the cries of “Do you have any extra tickets?” and “Sell me one!” could be heard everywhere. It is said that this kind of scene is rarely seen in recent years. Some experts excitedly said, “From here, I hear the footsteps of the theater’s turnaround.”

The eighteen troupes from across the country performed twenty programs, each one outstanding and full of twists and turns, with hit after hit. They had common strengths but also unique characteristics—this is one of the main reasons for their appeal. Whether traditional plays, newly adapted historical dramas, or modern dramas, they all strive to “perform stories close to the audience’s daily life and sing about the emotions in their hearts,” thus resonating with the audience. For example, the traditional play “Peach Blossom Pavilion” tells the story of a young man, Zhang Cai, who falls in love at first sight with a nun and the subsequent story of their love child; the newly adapted historical drama “The Spirit of the Khitan” depicts the sharp struggles within the Khitan tribe during the reign of Empress Xiao; the modern drama “The Libertine Widow” tells the story of a rural woman pursuing her own liberation. These plays, despite their vast time spans and diverse themes, all have parallels in real life, making them relatable. Furthermore, the characters in these plays, such as Wu Qiuhua in “The Libertine Widow,” Liu Yufen in “A World Beyond Oneself,” Yang Qiuju in “Village South,” Empress Xiao in “The Spirit of the Khitan,” Duo Ergun in “Eternal King,” and Chen Miaochang in “Peach Blossom Pavilion,” are all vivid and full of human emotions. The complex, multi-layered psychology of these characters is something that almost everyone can relate to. What’s amazing is that in expressing these common elements, each play has its own unique characteristics: “The Spirit of the Khitan” is ingeniously conceived, grand in content, and rich in meaning; “Eternal King” blends presentation and representation, with novel themes, ideas, and presentation methods; “A World Beyond Oneself” is simple and natural, fresh and beautiful… Therefore, these plays all ended in a burst of applause, with the audience reluctant to leave for a long time.

Another reason why this Pingju Opera exchange performance attracted so many people is the emergence of a group of outstanding young and middle-aged actors. They each have their own unique skills and styles. The leading actress of the Shijiazhuang Pingju Opera Troupe, Shang Lihua, excels in singing, speaking, acting, and fighting, with a solid foundation and comprehensive skills. In the three-act play, she portrays four different characters: in “Phoenix Falls on the Osmanthus Tree,” she portrays the complex inner world of the main character Zhang Jinfen; in “The Courtesan and the Oil Seller,” she portrays the courtesan’s longing for true love in this world; in “The Five-Colored Crystal Mountain,” she portrays the simplicity and kindness of the eldest prince and the arrogance and vanity of the second prince. The leading actress of the Tianjin Pingju Opera Troupe, Ma Shuhua, inherits the styles of Liu and Xian, learns from the strengths of Xin Fengxia, and in “Village South,” she expresses the intricate and touching emotions of human relationships with delicate and moving performances. The leading actress of the Changchun Pingju Opera Troupe, Zheng Guifang, has a voice that is both strong and soft, gentle and moving. A group of young actors have also emerged, attracting the attention of the audience. The 26-year-old Dian Jingyang from the Shenyang Pingju Opera Troupe, in “Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu,” plays Jia Baoyu. She inherits the tradition but is not limited by it, moving freely on stage, with beautiful singing, genuine emotions, and a performance that touches the audience’s heartstrings, creating an effect of onstage and offstage unity.

As the drama expert Qu Liuyi said, “Compared to some classical opera genres, Pingju Opera, due to its lack of fixed programs and norms, has a high degree of plasticity and adaptability, thus possessing a strong ability to adapt. It is good at following the trends of society, constantly adjusting and improving itself.” Many of the programs in this exchange performance have brought new developments to the art of Pingju Opera in various aspects, greatly expanding the expressive power of Pingju Opera in the new historical period. It will open a new chapter in the history of Chinese Pingju Opera.

　　集精汇萃　各展风采
    ——全国“振兴评剧交流演出”巡礼
    段心强　韩宁
    沈阳的五月，春意最浓。
    在这里举行的全国“振兴评剧交流演出”，增加了春天的气息。从五月十日开始，沈阳各大剧场，“票已售完”的牌子经常挂出，“有富余票吗？”、“让我一张吧！”的声音到处可以听到。据说，这是几年来很少见的盛况。一些专家兴奋地说：“从这里我听到了戏剧转机中前进的脚步声。”
    来自全国的十八个剧团上演的二十个节目，精采纷呈，波澜起伏，好戏迭出，既有共同的优点，又有各自的特色——这是吸引人的重要原因之一。无论是传统节目，还是新编历史剧，或是现代剧，都力求做到“演接近观众身边的事，唱抒发观众心思的情”，因而引起人们的共鸣。比如，传统戏《桃花庵》，写的是青年张才逛会与尼姑一见钟情，生下遗腹子引起的故事；新编历史剧《契丹魂》，写的是契丹族肖太后变法图强中的尖锐斗争；现代剧《风流寡妇》，写的是农村妇女追求自身解放的故事。这些戏尽管时间跨度很大，题材差异甚远，但人们在现实生活中都可以找到类似的事情，因而感到亲切。再者，这些剧中塑造的人物，如《风流寡妇》中的吴秋香，《身外有个世界》中的刘玉芬，《村南椰》中的杨秋菊，《契丹魂》中的肖太后，《亘古一王》中的多而衮，《桃花庵》中的陈妙常，都有血有肉，有七情六欲，他们复杂的、多层次的心理几乎人人都有。奇妙的是在表达这些共同的东西时，各个戏又有各自的特色：《契丹魂》构思巧妙，内容恢宏，意蕴丰富；《亘古一王》表现与再现融合，选材、立意、表现手法新颖；《身外有个世界》质朴自然，清新秀丽……因此，这些戏都是在热烈的掌声中结束，观众总是久久不愿离去。
    这次评剧交流演出吸引人的另一个原因是涌现出一批优秀的中青年演员。他们八仙过海，各显神通，各具特色，各有千秋。石家庄评剧一团主演商丽华，唱、念、做、打俱佳，技巧全面，功底深厚，在三折戏中塑造四个不同性格的人物：在《凤落梧桐》中表现了主要人物张金凤的复杂内心世界，在《花魁女与卖油郎》中表现了花魁女对人世间真正爱情的企盼，在《五彩水晶山》中表现了大王子的单纯善良，二王子的浮躁虚荣。天津评剧院二团主演马淑华，继承刘派、鲜派的风格，学习新凤霞的长处，在《村南椰》中，把人情缠绵的心态，表达得细腻动人。长春评剧院主演郑桂芳嗓音刚柔相济，委婉动听。一批青年演员的脱颖而出，更为观众瞩目。沈阳评剧院二十六岁的田敬阳，在《宝玉与黛玉》中演贾宝玉，她继承传统，又不被模式所限制，在舞台上动作自如，唱腔优美，感情逼真，打动了观众的心弦，出现了台上台下融为一体的效果。
    正如戏剧专家曲六乙所说：“评剧比起一些古典戏曲剧种，由于程式性和规范性不曾凝固，有着很大的可塑性与适应性，因此具有较强的应变能力，它善于随着社会的潮流，不断调整自己，完善自己”。这次交流演出的许多节目对评剧艺术有新的多方面的发展，大大拓宽了评剧艺术在新的历史时期的表现力。它将在中国评剧史上掀起新的一页。
