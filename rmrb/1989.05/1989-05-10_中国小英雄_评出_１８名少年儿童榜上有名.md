    China's youth today have a new set of role models to look up to. The "China's Little Heroes" were announced today in Beijing by the China Women's Magazine. Eighteen young heroes under the age of 15 made it to the list.

    The 18 little heroes are: Zhao Jinbao, Li Yongjun, He Xiangjiao (deceased), Huang Yongze, Jiang Baosong, Yu Kuiming, Deng Chongnan, Zeng Hong, Zheng Cui, Zhu Yinglai, Wang Haiyan, Cui Tao, who risked their lives to save others; Jiang Yan, Wu Xiumei, Mao Peng, Ma Lining, and Ma Yumin, who bravely fought against criminals; and Cai Jianhua, who is known for his kindness and helpfulness.

    These little heroes were selected by the review committee from nearly a hundred recommendations from more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country. Their stories are genuine, credible, and moving.

    At today's award ceremony, Kang Keqing presented the awards to the little heroes. Guan Tao, a member of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's Federation, said at the meeting that the deeds of China's little heroes not only inspire the broad masses of young people but also enlighten adults. She urged young people to learn from the noble thoughts and qualities of the little heroes, but not to simply imitate them. She also hoped that local leaders would not impose various pressures on the little heroes and would not be overly demanding or critical of them, as they are still children.

    It is understood that "China's Little Heroes" will be selected annually in the future.

　　“中国小英雄”评出    
    １８名少年儿童榜上有名
    本报北京５月１０日讯  记者袁建达报道：中国少年儿童今天又有了一批学习的好榜样。由中国妇女杂志社组织评选的“中国小英雄”今天在北京揭晓，１８名１５岁以下的少年英雄榜上有名。
    这１８名小英雄是：舍己救人的赵金宝、李永军、何香姣（已牺牲）、黄永泽、蒋宝松、于奎明、邓崇南、曾鸿、郑翠、朱应来、王海燕、崔涛，勇斗歹徒的詹燕、吴秀梅、茅棚、马立宁、马玉民，助人为乐的蔡建华。
    这些小英雄是评审委员会从全国２０多个省、直辖市、自治区推荐的近百份材料中选拔出来的，他们的事迹真实、可信、感人。
    在今天的表彰会上，康克清向小英雄颁发了奖品。全国妇联书记处书记关涛在会上说，中国小英雄的事迹不仅激励着广大青少年，也给成年人带来启迪。她要求少年儿童学习小英雄的崇高思想和品质，但千万不要简单模仿。她还希望各地领导不要给小英雄们增加种种压力，更不要对他们求全或挑剔，因为他们还是孩子。
    据悉，“中国小英雄”今后将每年度评选一次。　（附图片）
