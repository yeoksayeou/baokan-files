Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 29th.

According to a report by the Associated Press, approximately 100,000 Soviet citizens gathered in Moscow on May 28th to protest the election of Gorbachev as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. They demanded that the former Moscow City Committee Secretary, Yeltsin, be nominated as a candidate for Vice Chairman of the Supreme Soviet.

According to Soviet television news, the number of participants in this protest activity was about 70,000. The organizers of this protest claimed that the scale of this protest activity was the largest in Moscow's history.

Yeltsin did not make it into the Supreme Soviet during the election of its members at the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies on May 27th. However, Yeltsin expressed his willingness to compete for the position of Vice Chairman in future votes.

The People's Daily reports: On the afternoon of May 28th, a gathering was held at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. Physicist Sakharov, agricultural expert Gikhonov, several deputies from other regions, and some leaders of mass organizations spoke at the gathering. Their speeches mainly addressed the following issues:

1. Some proposals from Moscow deputies were coldly received at the meeting, giving the impression that the process of democratization might be hindered.
2. Most deputies based their statements on the will of the leadership, leading to suspicions of manipulation or pressure during the selection of deputies. They proposed revoking the credentials of some deputies.
3. They expressed disappointment that advocates for radical reforms, such as Yeltsin, did not make it into the Supreme Soviet.
4. They believed that openness had not sufficiently addressed the issue of officials' corruption and that many departments had not taken action, while some public feedback had even been distorted.
5. They demanded the release of members of the Karabakh Committee.

In the May 27th election for representatives of the Supreme Soviet, the former First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee, Yeltsin, unexpectedly became a representative of the Supreme Soviet after being substituted for the seat vacated by Professor Kazanik of Omsk University, who voluntarily relinquished his position.

    莫斯科十万人集会
    抗议戈氏当选最高苏维埃主席
    反对代表按领导人意志来表态
    新华社北京5月29日电  据美联社报道，约有10万苏联人28日在莫斯科举行集会，抗议戈尔巴乔夫当选为苏联最高苏维埃主席，要求提名莫斯科前市委书记叶利钦为苏联最高苏维埃副主席候选人。
    据苏联电视新闻报道，参加这次抗议活动的人数约有7万。据这次抗议活动的组织者声称，此次抗议活动的规模在莫斯科史上是最大的。
    叶利钦在27日的苏联全国人民代表大会上就最高苏维埃成员进行选举时未能进入最高苏维埃。但叶利钦表示准备在今后投票中，竞选副主席职务。
    本报讯  5月28日下午在莫斯科卢日尼基广场举行的集会上，物理学家萨哈罗夫、农业专家吉洪诺夫、几位来自外地的人民代表及一些群众组织的负责人发了言。这些人的发言主要涉及下列一些问题：
    一，莫斯科代表的一些建议在会上受到冷遇，使人有一种民主化进程可能要受到阻遏的感觉；二，大多数代表以领导人意志为自己表态的依据，因而怀疑当初选代表时有包办代替或施加压力的行为，提出要收回一些代表的代表证；三，对叶利钦等一批提倡激进改革的人未能进入最高苏维埃表示失望；四，公开性在反对官员的贪污腐化方面远未涉足，许多部门未予过问，而群众的一些反映甚至受到歪曲；五，要求释放卡拉巴赫委员会的成员。
