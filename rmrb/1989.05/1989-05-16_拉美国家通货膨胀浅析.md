Since the end of World War II, Latin American countries have consistently had the highest inflation rates in the world. In the 1970s, inflation in this region soared like a runaway horse. Starting from 1983, the average annual inflation rate reached three digits (only in 1986 it was in the two digits). The severity of the problem is also reflected in the increasing number of countries experiencing high inflation. In the 1960s, only 4 countries had an average annual inflation rate exceeding 15%, which increased to 9 in the 1970s and 16 in the 1980s. In 1988, out of the 20 countries with the highest inflation rates in the world, half were from Latin America. This widespread and long-term severe inflation in Latin American countries is often referred to as the "persistent Latin fever" or "hyperinflation."

High inflation brings serious consequences

High inflation has had serious impacts on the economic and social development of Latin American countries, particularly since the 1980s. From 1980 to 1987, the GDP of the Latin American region grew by only 10.7%, averaging an increase of just over 1% per year. The per capita GDP actually decreased by 5.5%, while the annual inflation rate rose from 54.8% to 147%. Last year, the GDP of Latin American countries grew by only 0.7%, and the per capita GDP decreased by 1.5%, falling to the level of a decade ago. However, the inflation rate reached a record high of 472.8%. High inflation has constrained the economic recovery and development of Latin American countries. Due to sluggish investment and economic contraction, unemployment has increased, supply shortages have occurred, prices have soared, and workers' real incomes and purchasing power have declined. Consequently, strikes and other forms of protests have frequently occurred, crime has increased, social unrest has arisen, and the democratic processes in various countries have been directly affected. The large-scale bloody events in Venezuela in February this year, triggered by price surges, are a prominent example.

Multiple factors contributing to high inflation

Inflation is caused by a variety of complex factors. In addition to general factors, Latin American countries have experienced high inflation for many years due to their unique circumstances. Firstly, many Latin American countries have long implemented expansionary fiscal and monetary policies, leading to excessive public spending and large fiscal deficits, which are important factors in causing severe inflation. In the absence of sufficient external funding and with empty national treasuries, governments have resorted to printing money and borrowing internally and externally to cover the deficits, directly exacerbating inflation. In Brazil, the government's expenditure on civil servants' salaries alone accounts for 60% of the annual national revenue.

Secondly, from an economic structure perspective, some sectors that are in short supply have not grown accordingly, leading to imbalances in the national economy's agricultural, light, and heavy industries, as well as within these sectors. The slow development of agriculture, energy, and other sectors has led to price increases in food and fuel, which in turn drive up overall consumer prices.

Thirdly, from the perspective of guiding economic development, some countries have pursued high economic growth rates beyond their fiscal capacity, leading to excessive investment scales, excessive money supply, and credit expansion. This has burdened the government with a heavy load. Additionally, during times of deteriorating international economic conditions, they have been unable to cool down the economy in a timely manner, keeping inflation high for an extended period.

Fourthly, for many years, there has been a blind imitation of the consumption patterns of developed countries, leading to excessive consumption that has caused total demand to exceed total supply, exacerbating the supply-demand contradiction. Latin American countries have the highest levels of food and durable goods consumption among developing countries. Excessive consumption has severely impacted the market, driving up prices.

Lastly, the large-scale borrowing of external debt has also been an important factor in accelerating inflation in Latin America. By the end of last year, Latin American countries owed a total of $401 billion in external debt. The net outflow of funds due to interest and profit payments alone amounted to $29 billion, equivalent to 4% of the region's GDP, which is a heavy burden for Latin American debt-ridden countries. Due to insufficient foreign exchange earnings to cover principal and interest payments, governments have had to borrow new loans, increase taxes, and print money. Additionally, whether the funds borrowed from abroad are used for imports, domestic investment, or covering fiscal deficits, they will inevitably lead to an increase in the domestic money supply.

How they are curbing inflation

In recent years, Latin American countries have made curbing high inflation a major goal in their economic adjustments. Some countries have focused on strictly controlling the money supply and reducing government fiscal deficits according to traditional theories, while others have emphasized using non-traditional "shock therapy," freezing prices, wages, and exchange rates. Some countries have begun to adjust their economic structures, but due to the lack of comprehensive treatment of the various factors causing high inflation, except for a few countries, the anti-inflation measures have not been effective, and some countries have even seen worsening situations. The National Statistics Bureau of Peru announced on April 1 that the annual inflation rate in recent months has reached 3414%. Since 1985, Argentina and Brazil have successively implemented the "Austral Plan" and the "Cruzado Plan," which have only had a short-term effect in suppressing inertia inflation and have not eliminated the root causes of high inflation, with consumer prices continuing to rise. Countries like Brazil have also adopted measures to adjust wages in response to price increases to reduce the impact of inflation on workers' purchasing power, but this has led to a vicious cycle of prices and wages rising together, which does not help in fundamentally controlling inflation. Starting last year, Latin American countries have begun to implement a series of new anti-inflation plans, drawing on past experiences. In January last year, Mexico began implementing the "Economic Solidarity Agreement" signed by the government, business sector, and labor unions, mobilizing the entire society to fight against high inflation. The government first comprehensively adjusted unreasonable prices, wages, and exchange rates, then froze prices and exchange rates, the business sector promised not to raise prices arbitrarily, and the unions guaranteed not to demand wage increases. This approach has had relatively good results, with Mexico's annual inflation rate dropping from 160% in 1987 to 60% last year. Later, Brazil and Argentina referred to Mexico's experience and also used social agreements with various parties to curb hyperinflation, and price increases began to slow down. Some countries have focused on reducing public spending and cutting fiscal deficits as key anti-inflation measures, controlling the growth of total social demand, improving the government's fiscal situation, and easing inflationary pressures. The anti-inflation measures taken by Latin American countries mostly have economic contraction characteristics. Although they have had a stabilizing effect on the economy in a certain period, they have also caused economic recession, which is not conducive to the overall economic adjustment. In addition, unfavorable factors in the international economic environment have also increased the difficulty for Latin American countries in fighting against high inflation.

High inflation is a deep-rooted problem in the economic life of Latin American countries, making it difficult to eradicate. Due to the constraints of domestic political, economic, and social factors, as well as external conditions, controlling inflation will be a long-term and arduous task.

　　拉美国家通货膨胀浅析
    管彦忠
    战后以来，拉丁美洲国家的通货膨胀始终居世界之冠。进入７０年代，这一地区的通货膨胀更如脱缰之马，扶摇直上。从１９８３年起年平均通货膨胀率高达３位数（仅１９８６年为两位数）。问题的严重性还表现在处于高通货膨胀的国家不断增多，６０年代年平均通货膨胀率超过１５％的国家只有４个，７０年代增至９个，８０年代增加到１６个。１９８８年全世界通货膨胀率最高的２０个国家中，拉美国家占了半数。对拉美国家这种普遍的长期的恶性通货膨胀，人们称之为“不退烧的拉丁症”或“超级通货膨胀”。
    高通货膨胀带来严重后果
    高通货膨胀对拉美国家的经济和社会发展带来严重的后果，这在８０年代以后尤为突出。从１９８０年到１９８７年８年中，拉美地区的国内生产总值只增长１０．７％，平均每年只增加１个多百分点，人均国内生产总值则绝对下降５．５％，而同期年通货膨胀率从５４．８％升到１４７％。去年拉美国内生产总值仅增长０．７％，人均国内生产总值下降了１．５％，降到了１０年前的水平。而通货膨胀率却高达４７２．８％，创世界纪录。高通货膨胀制约了拉美国家经济的恢复与发展。由于投资不振出现的经济萎缩使失业增多，供应短缺，物价飞涨，职工的实际收入和购买力下降，因而罢工及其他形式的抗议活动不断发生，犯罪增加，引起社会动荡，直接影响到各国的民主化进程。委内瑞拉今年２月间由于物价暴涨引发的大规模流血事件，就是一个突出例证。
    产生高通货膨胀的多种因素
    通货膨胀是由多种复杂因素造成的。拉美国家多年的高通货膨胀除一般因素外，还有其特殊原因。首先，许多拉美国家长期执行扩张性的财政货币政策，造成公共开支过大，财政赤字过多，这是促成恶性通货膨胀的重要原因。在外部资金来源不足和国库空虚的情况下，政府就靠增发钞票和举借内外债来弥补赤字，直接加剧了通货膨胀。巴西政府仅支付公职人员的薪金就占全年国库收入的６０％。
    其次，从经济结构上来说，有些短缺的部门未能相应增长，使国民经济的农轻重各部门及部门内部出现比例失调。农业、能源等部门发展缓慢，食品和燃料的涨价必然带动整个消费物价随之上涨。
    第三，从发展经济的指导思想上看，一些国家超过本国财政的承受能力，片面追求高经济增长率，由于投资规模过大，货币投放过多，信贷膨胀，使政府背上沉重的包袱。同时在国际经济环境恶化时，又不能及时降温，使通货膨胀长期居高不下。
    第四，多年来盲目模仿发达国家的消费方式，超前消费使社会总需求超过了总供给，供需矛盾尖锐化。拉美国家的食品和耐用品的消费水平都居发展中国家之首。超前消费猛烈冲击市场，推动物价上涨。
    最后，大量举借外债也是加速拉美通货膨胀的重要因素。到去年底，拉美国家共欠外债４０１０亿美元，全年因支付利息和利润净流出资金２９０亿美元，相当于本地区国内生产总值的４％，对拉美债务国是沉重的负担。由于外汇收入不够还本付息，政府不得不借新债、增税和增发钞票。同时，从国外借来的资金无论是用于进口，还是在国内投资和弥补财政赤字，都必然相应增加国内货币的发放。
    他们怎样遏制通货膨胀
    近几年来，拉美国家在调整经济的过程中，都把遏制高通货膨胀作为一项主要目标。它们有的注重按传统理论严格控制货币发行量和压缩政府的财政赤字，有的侧重采用非传统的“冲击疗法”，冻结物价、工资和汇率，也有的国家开始调整经济结构，但由于没有对造成高通货膨胀的多种因素进行综合治理，除少数国家之外，反通货膨胀措施的效果并不明显，有的国家甚至情况更加恶化。秘鲁国家统计局４月１日宣布，最近几个月的年通货膨胀率已达３４１４％。１９８５年以来，阿根廷、巴西先后实行的“奥斯特拉尔计划”和“克鲁扎多计划”都只在短期内对抑制惯性通货膨胀有一定作用，未能消除产生高通货膨胀的根源，消费物价继续上涨。巴西等国还采用随物价上涨相应调整工资的办法，减少通货膨胀对职工购买力的打击，但由此形成物价与工资互相攀升，无助于从根本上制服通货膨胀。从去年开始，拉美国家吸取过去的经验教训，开始实施一系列新的反通货膨胀计划。去年１月，墨西哥开始实行政府、企业界和劳工三方面签署的“经济团结契约”，动员全社会的力量与高通货膨胀作斗争。政府先综合调整不合理的价格、工资和汇率，然后冻结物价和汇率，企业界承诺不随意涨价，工会保证不要求增加工资。这一做法收到了较好的效果，墨西哥的年通货膨胀率从１９８７年的１６０％降至去年的６０％。后来巴西和阿根廷参照墨西哥的经验，也通过与各方达成社会协议的办法来遏制恶性通货膨胀，物价上涨开始趋缓。一些国家把减少公共开支和压缩财政赤字作为反通货膨胀的重点，控制社会总需求的增长，改善政府的财政状况，减缓了通货膨胀的压力。拉美国家采取的这些反通货膨胀措施多数带有经济紧缩的特点，虽在一定时期有稳定经济的作用，但同时也造成经济衰退，对调整经济的全局不利。此外，国际经济环境的不利因素，也增加了拉美国家与高通货膨胀作斗争的难度。
    高通货膨胀是拉美国家经济生活中的痼疾，积重难返。由于受国内政治、经济、社会诸因素的制约和外部条件的影响，制服通货膨胀将是一项长期、艰巨的任务。
