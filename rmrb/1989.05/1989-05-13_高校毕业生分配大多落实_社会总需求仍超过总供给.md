Most college graduates have secured placements, but social demand still exceeds supply. Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 12th. (Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Guanquan, Shandong People's Radio reporter Wang Xiaoting) The reporter learned from the 1989 National College Graduates Placement Coordination Meeting that this year's social demand for college graduates still exceeds the number of graduates. Graduates from schools under the State Education Commission have adopted methods such as inviting in and sending out, through recruitment and recommendation activities, and most have already secured their placement plans.

The State Education Commission introduced that this year's principle for the distribution of college graduates in China remains primarily planned distribution. According to statistics, the current number of college graduates still cannot meet the needs of various regions and departments. The Ministry of Communications, the Petrochemical Corporation, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics, and regions such as Beijing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangxi, and Yunnan have all organized recruitment and recommendation meetings with the participation of schools and employing units. Tianjin, Shandong, and Jilin have taken a positive attitude this year to absorb graduates and have properly arranged their work.

A relevant responsible person from the State Education Commission pointed out that although the total demand still exceeds the total supply, the units that need graduates the most are factories, mines, and small and medium-sized cities at the grassroots level, which is in conflict with the graduates' intentions. The ideological education of graduates is weak, causing graduates to have unrealistic expectations for their placements. Therefore, it is necessary to further strengthen the ideological education of graduates to serve the needs of the state.

　　高校毕业生分配大多落实  社会总需求仍超过总供给
    新华社济南５月１２日电（新华社记者刘关权、山东人民广播电台记者王晓亭）记者从１９８９年全国高校毕业生分配计划协调会上获悉，今年社会对高校毕业生的需求量仍超过毕业生人数。国家教委所属学校的毕业生，采取请进来、走出去的办法，通过招聘、推荐等活动，大多数已经落实了分配方案。
    国家教委介绍，今年我国高等学校毕业生分配原则仍是以计划分配为主。据统计，现有高校的毕业生仍然满足不了各地方、各部门的需要。交通部、石化总公司、化工部、水利部、机电部和北京、上海、江苏、广西、云南等地都组织了由学校和用人单位参加的招聘、推荐会，天津、山东、吉林等地今年采取积极态度吸收毕业生，并且妥善安排好他们的工作。
    国家教委的有关负责人指出，虽然总需求仍超过总供给，但需要毕业生较多的是厂矿和中小城市等基层单位，这与毕业生意向发生矛盾。毕业生的思想教育工作薄弱，致使毕业生对分配的期望不切合实际。为此，需要进一步加强毕业生服从国家需要的思想教育工作。
