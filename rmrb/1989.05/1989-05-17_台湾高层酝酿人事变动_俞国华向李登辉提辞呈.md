Taipei's United Daily News reported on the front page that the Premier of Taiwan, Yu Kuo-hua, has submitted his resignation to President Lee Teng-hui. Lee Teng-hui personally expressed his desire to retain Yu and asked him to take back his resignation. However, Yu insisted on resigning.

The report stated that speculation is rife that Yu Kuo-hua might run for the position of Vice President next year, but this possibility has significantly diminished. Additionally, the successor to the Premier and the potential high-level personnel changes that may follow are drawing considerable attention from various sectors.

Yu Kuo-hua was appointed as the Premier of Taiwan by Chiang Ching-kuo in 1984 and will complete his five-year term at the end of this month.

　　台湾高层酝酿人事变动  俞国华向李登辉提辞呈
    本报香港５月１７日电  台北《联合报》在头版头条报道，台“行政院长”俞国华已向“总统”李登辉提出辞呈。李登辉当面表示慰留，并请俞将辞呈携回。俞国华则表示“坚辞”。
    报道说，外界臆测俞国华将在明年参加“副总统”选举，这种可能已大幅降低。另外，“行政院长”的继任人选及可能牵动的高层人事变动，亦极受各界注目。
    俞国华是在１９８４年由蒋经国提名担任台“行政院长”，至月底，任职满５年。
