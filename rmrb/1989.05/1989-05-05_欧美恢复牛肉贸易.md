Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, May 4th.

The reporter learned from the European Community Commission that the EC and the United States reached an agreement today to resolve their beef trade dispute. They agreed to resume the interrupted Euro-American beef trade "in accordance with each other's laws" starting from this year.

According to the agreement, the EC will allow U.S. beef that has been verified as not treated with hormones to enter the Western European market. The United States, in turn, will agree to reduce the scale of tariff sanctions on goods imported from Western Europe to the United States in proportion to the amount of beef entering the Western European market.

In January of this year, the EC began banning the import of hormone-treated beef from third countries, which met with strong opposition from beef-exporting countries like the United States. The United States then announced economic sanctions against the EC, imposing a 100% tariff on several food items imported from Western Europe. Due to the EC's restraint, it did not retaliate, thus avoiding the escalation of this trade conflict.

In February of this year, both sides established a joint working group to seek a "technical solution" to the trade dispute. The EC Commission said that both sides agreed that the joint working group would continue to work for a period of time to further refine the agreement just reached.

　　欧美恢复牛肉贸易
    新华社布鲁塞尔５月４日电  （记者诸葛仓麟）记者从欧洲共同体委员会获悉，欧共体和美国今天就解决双方牛肉贸易争端达成协议，同意在“尊重各自法律的情况下”恢复从今年年初中断的欧美牛肉贸易。
    根据这项协议，欧共体准许经过检验确实未经激素处理的美国牛肉进入西欧市场；美国则同意根据进入西欧市场的牛肉数量，相应压缩对西欧输美商品的关税制裁规模。
    今年１月，欧共体开始禁止从第三国进口经过激素处理的牛肉，遭到了牛肉出口国美国的强烈反对。美国随即宣布对欧共体实行经济制裁，对几种从西欧进口的食品加征百分之百的关税。由于欧共体的克制，没有实行反报复，从而避免了这场贸易冲突轮番升级。
    双方于今年２月成立了联合工作组，寻求贸易争端的“技术性解决办法”。欧共体委员会说，双方商定，联合工作组将继续工作一段时间，以便完善刚刚达成的协议。
