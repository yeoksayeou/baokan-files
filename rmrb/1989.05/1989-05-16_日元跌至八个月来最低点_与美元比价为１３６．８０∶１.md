The yen fell to its lowest level in eight months today, trading at 136.80 yen to the dollar on the Tokyo foreign exchange market.

Throughout this year, the yen has been on a downward trend. Market analysts here attribute the continued decline to political instability in Japan, as well as the aggressive purchasing of dollars by Japanese exporters, government agencies, and overseas investors.

It is believed that the yen's exchange rate against the dollar may continue to fall in the near future.
