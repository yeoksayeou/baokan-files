Guangzhou's agricultural and sideline product markets have been thriving in recent years, but they are also chaotic, and prices are unstable, according to a recent statement by relevant officials from the municipal government.

Due to the open city gates, agricultural and sideline products flow into the city from all directions, ensuring a constant supply. Statistics show that the city's annual vegetable supply reaches 700,000 tons, meeting the needs of 2.8 million residents and 1.1 million transient populations. The annual poultry supply is 35 million, more than sufficient for local consumption. The suburban areas have 800,000 mu (approximately 53,333 hectares) of fruit plantations, balancing the supply of northern and southern fruits.

These projects have certain advantages in Guangzhou, but other production and sales face numerous issues. For instance, the annual pork consumption is about 115,600 tons, with a self-sufficiency rate of only 30.2%. The annual seafood consumption is 130,000 tons, with a self-sufficiency rate of just 20%. The annual egg demand is over 30,000 tons, with a self-sufficiency rate of less than 32%. Milk, fresh flowers, and other products also maintain low self-sufficiency rates. Management work has also lagged behind since the city gates opened.

To improve this situation, the municipal government is organizing efforts for democratic and scientific decision-making, aiming to implement the overall plan for the "vegetable basket" project within a few months to increase the effective supply of agricultural and sideline products.

### 广州城门大开市场繁荣  旺中带乱价格尚不稳定

　　广州城门大开市场繁荣
    旺中带乱价格尚不稳定
    本报广州５月２７日电  记者梁兆明报道：广州农副产品市场现状如何？市政府有关负责人日前认为近年来一直保持繁荣兴旺，但旺中带乱，价格也不稳定。
    由于城门大开，农副产品从四面八方源源进城，使广州农副产品供应常年不缺。据统计，全市一年的蔬菜上市量达７０万吨，基本满足２８０万市民和１１０万流动人口的需要；家禽年上市量３５００万只，自给有余；市郊农村水果种植面积８０万亩，南北水果交流基本平衡。
    这些项目的商品生产在广州有一定的优势，但其它的产销则存在不少问题。例如，猪肉年销量约为１１．５６万吨，自给率仅为３０．２％；水产品年销量为１３万吨，自给率只有２０％；蛋品年需量３万余吨，自给率不到３２％；牛奶、鲜花等也只保持低水平的自给率。城门大开后的管理工作也没有跟上。
    为改变这种状况，市政府正组织力量进行民主、科学的决策，务求在几个月内实施“菜篮子”工程的总体规划，增加农副产品的有效供给。
