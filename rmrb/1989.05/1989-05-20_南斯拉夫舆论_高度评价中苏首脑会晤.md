Yugoslav public opinion has highly praised the Sino-Soviet summit. The People's Daily, Belgrade, May 19th. Reporter Yan Zheng reports: The Sino-Soviet summit has attracted great attention from the Yugoslav media. Various news outlets have published articles and commentaries, describing it as the biggest international event of the year, marking a new chapter not only for the relationship between the two countries but also for friendly cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and even the entire world. The "News Weekly," which was published two days ahead of schedule today, titled its article "Great Reconciliation" to comprehensively review the achievements and significance of the Sino-Soviet summit.

The article states that Soviet leader Gorbachev's visit to China can even be considered his greatest diplomatic achievement so far. It can also be said to be a victory for China's patience and perseverance. Because China has finally welcomed its giant neighbor to accept its insistence on principles, namely, to fulfill the three conditions it proposed. The true meaning, results, and direction of the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations will be revealed with the development of history. The influence that can be felt will far exceed the borders of the two countries, first in the Asia-Pacific region, and then in the relationship between each country in these regions with the United States, Japan, and the newly industrialized countries and regions in Southeast Asia. From now on, they must all consider the changes that have occurred in the relationship between Moscow and Beijing.

The article states that both China and the Soviet Union particularly need stability, both firmly believe that reforms must be carried out, and both are focused on domestic issues, which has prompted them to reconcile. The author also cites Soviet reports to illustrate that Soviet citizens envy and yearn for the results of China's economic reforms. Soviet reporters describe the various shop windows on the commercial streets of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou with unabashed admiration, and the rich variety of goods that cater to all tastes... and say, "These obvious achievements of economic reform are precisely what we (the Soviet Union) lack the most." The article believes that China has placed its reform focus on the economic sector, first conducting economic reforms and then political system reforms. The decisions they have made in the economic sector are boldly anti-dogmatic, although they may not have considered all aspects sufficiently and may have made mistakes, but the direction they have taken has so far yielded results. In contrast, the Soviet Union's reforms have taken the opposite path, that is, democratizing domestic political life but not yet conducting corresponding major reforms in the economic sector. During the Sino-Soviet summit, the peoples of both countries hoped that their leaders would exchange reform plans and learn from each other in certain aspects.

　　南斯拉夫舆论
    高度评价中苏首脑会晤
    本报贝尔格莱德５月１９日电  记者严正报道：中苏首脑会晤引起了南斯拉夫舆论界的极大重视，各新闻媒介纷纷发表文章和评论称这是今年中苏最大的国际事件，它不仅为两国关系，而且也为亚洲太平洋地区甚至整个世界的友好合作关系揭开了新的一页。今天提前２日出版的《新闻周刊》以《伟大的和解》为题发表文章，全面评述了中苏首脑会晤的成果和意义。
    文章说，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫访华甚至可以视作他迄今为止在世界上进行的外交长征中取得的一次最大的成功。当然也可以说是中国耐心和顽强精神的胜利。因为中国终于迎来了它的巨大邻居接受其坚持的原则，即履行他们提出的三项条件。中苏关系正常化的真正的意义、成果和发展的方向，会随着历史的发展显示出来，可以感受到的影响将远远超出两国的国境，首先是在亚洲太平洋地区，然后是在这些地区的每个国家与美国、日本以及与亚洲东南部新兴工业国家和地区的关系中，都会感受它的影响。从今以后它们都必须考虑到莫斯科北京关系中发生了变化的情况。
    文章说，中苏都特别需要稳定，都坚信必须进行改革，都要专心致志于国内问题，这促使它们进行和解。作者还援引苏联的报道，说明苏联居民羡慕和热望中国经济改革取得的成果，苏联的记者以毫不掩饰的钦佩之情描写北京、上海、广州商业街道的各种橱窗和符合各式各样口味的丰富商品……并说“这些明显的经济改革的成就正是我们（苏联）所最为缺少的”。文章认为中国把自己改革的重点放在经济领域，先经济改革接着进行政治体制改革。他们在经济领域作出的决定是勇敢的反教条主义的，尽管在某些方面可能考虑不够充分，也可能有错误，但是他们所采取的方向至今已取得了成果，而苏联的改革正好走相反的道路，即国内政治生活民主化但至今未在经济领域进行相应的重大改革。中苏首脑会晤时两国人民都渴望自己的领导人交流改革方案并在某些方面相互学习。
