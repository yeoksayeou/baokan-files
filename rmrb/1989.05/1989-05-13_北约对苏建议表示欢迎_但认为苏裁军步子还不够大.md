	NATO today issued a statement in Brussels welcoming the Soviet Union's proposal to unilaterally reduce 500 short-range missiles within the year. However, it pointed out that since NATO has unilaterally reduced 2,400 short-range missiles over the past 10 years and given that the Soviet Union still possesses a massive military force, the Soviet Union's step "is still not large enough."

	The statement said that NATO member countries clearly recognize that Gorbachev's proposal indicates that the Soviet Union's position is approaching NATO's claims and proposals. However, the proposal does not mention the destruction of missiles and only covers the reduction of nuclear forces deployed in Eastern European countries, excluding nuclear weapons deployed in the European part of the Soviet Union.

	The statement pointed out, "We certainly welcome the Soviet Union's further reduction of its abnormal military superiority, but it is undeniable that the alliance cannot accept denuclearization of Europe."

	According to Western statistics, the Warsaw Pact currently has 1,450 short-range missile launchers deployed in Europe, while NATO has only 88.

　　北约对苏建议表示欢迎    
    但认为苏裁军步子还不够大
    新华社布鲁塞尔５月１２日电  北约组织今天在这里发表一份声明对苏联将在年内单方面削减５００枚短导的建议表示欢迎，但同时指出，由于北约过去１０年中已单方面削减了２４００枚短导，加上苏联仍拥有庞大的军事力量，因此，苏联迈出的这一步“还不够大”。
    声明说，北约盟国清楚地意识到，戈尔巴乔夫的建议表明苏联的立场与北约的主张和建议接近了，但这一建议没有提到销毁导弹，而且削减范围也只涉及到苏驻东欧国家的核力量，没有包括部署在苏联欧洲部分的核武器。
    声明指出，“我们当然欢迎苏进一步削减其不正常的军事优势，但毫无疑问，联盟对欧洲无核化是不能接受的。”
    据西方统计，目前华约部署在欧洲的短导发射装置为１４５０个，而北约仅有８８个。
