Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 26th.

President Bush announced on the morning of the 26th that the United States will hold negotiations with Japan, Brazil, and India on June 16th to address the issue of trade barriers imposed by these countries against the U.S.

He made this announcement before departing Washington for Europe to attend the upcoming NATO summit.

Bush stated, "Our goal is to open markets and eliminate trade barriers." He urged the governments of Japan, Brazil, and India to engage in constructive cooperation with the United States to resolve these issues.

Japan, Brazil, and India were named by the U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills on the evening of the 25th as countries practicing "unfair trade" that need to be prioritized for resolution.

According to the U.S. Comprehensive Trade Act of 1988, the U.S. government will engage in negotiations to demand that countries listed as practicing "unfair trade" against the U.S. remove their trade barriers. Otherwise, the U.S. will take retaliatory measures against these countries.

Japanese Foreign Minister Uno Sōsuke stated that the U.S. move is an "attempt to shift attention away from the main causes of trade imbalances." He believes that the primary cause of trade imbalances lies in the U.S. budget deficit.

Indian Minister of Commerce Dinesh Singh accused the U.S. of setting up and maintaining various trade barriers to prevent goods from other countries from entering its market. He said, "It is difficult to ask others to remove barriers while not removing them yourself." The Indian side considers the U.S. actions to be "completely illegal, unreasonable, and unfair."

The Brazilian government also expressed dissatisfaction with the U.S. actions, denying that it practices "unfair trade" against the U.S.

After the U.S. government listed the above three countries as those practicing "unfair trade" against the U.S., some members of the U.S. Congress welcomed the move. Some even called for more stringent measures to force these countries to open their markets to U.S. goods.

### 布什总统宣布  美将与日巴印举行贸易谈判

　　布什总统宣布
    美将与日巴印举行贸易谈判
    新华社华盛顿５月２６日电  美国总统布什２６日晨发表声明说，美国将于６月１６日就消除日本、巴西、印度对美的贸易堡垒问题与三国举行谈判。
    他是在离开华盛顿去欧洲参加即将召开的北约首脑会议前发表这项声明的。
    布什说，“我们的目的是开放市场，消除贸易堡垒。”他敦促日本、巴西和印度三国政府与美国进行建设性合作来解决这些问题。
    日本、巴西、印度三国是在２５日晚上被美国贸易代表卡拉·希尔斯宣布为对美国实行“不公平贸易”、需要优先解决的国家名单的。
    按照美国１９８８年通过的综合贸易法的规定，美国政府将通过谈判，要求那些被列入对美国实行“不公平贸易”优先名单的国家取消对美国的贸易堡垒。不然，美国将对这些国家采取报复措施。
    日本外相宇野宗佑说，美国的这一步骤是“企图转移对造成贸易不平衡的主要原因的注意”。他认为，贸易不平衡的主要原因在于美国的预算赤字。
    印度商业部长迪内什·辛格指控美国设置和维持了多种贸易堡垒来阻止别国商品进入它的市场。他说，“这是很难要求别人取消壁垒，而自己却不取消壁垒的”。印度方面认为，美国的行动是“完全不合法、不合理、不公平的”。
    巴西政府对美国的行动也表示不满。它否认对美国实行“不公平贸易”。
    在美国政府把上述三国列为对美国实行“不公平贸易”国家的优先名单后，美国国会的一些议员表示欢迎。有的甚至还要求采取更为严厉的措施来迫使那些国家为美国商品开放市场。
