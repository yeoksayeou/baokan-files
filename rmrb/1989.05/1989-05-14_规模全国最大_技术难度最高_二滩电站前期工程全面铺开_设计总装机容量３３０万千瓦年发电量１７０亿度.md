The largest hydropower project in the nation—Ertan Hydropower Station—has fully commenced its preliminary work, progressing smoothly.

Ertan Hydropower Station is located in the lower reaches of the Yalong River in Sichuan Province, 40 kilometers away from Panzhihua City. With a designed total installed capacity of 3.3 million kilowatts and an annual power generation of 17 billion kilowatt-hours, it is the largest and most technically challenging hydropower station among those already built and under construction in China. Its scale is also rare in the world.

Experts in hydropower who are currently conducting inspections here believe that Ertan Hydropower Station has exceptionally favorable conditions. The Yalong River is rich in hydropower resources, with an annual water flow exceeding that of the Yellow River. Additionally, it has minimal submerged losses, low costs, and high returns. According to the design plan, Ertan Hydropower Station is scheduled to be completed and start generating electricity by 1997. Once fully operational, it will significantly alleviate the power supply tensions in Sichuan, promoting the development of mineral resources in Panzhihua City and the Xichang region.

Since the commencement of the preliminary work in 1987, the project has progressed very smoothly. The reporter observed the bustling construction site, where over 5,000 workers are tirelessly working day and night in the steep mountains and valleys. The 45-kilometer-long construction road has been completed by 80%, and the newly built suspension bridge across the Yalong River is already in use. The 3.5-kilometer-long road tunnel has also been fully excavated. Power supply lines and microwave communication equipment are being rapidly constructed, with the expectation of completing all preliminary preparations by the end of this year.

It is reported that Ertan Hydropower Station is a large-scale power station jointly invested in by the central government and local authorities, with some external funds. All construction projects of the power station are open for bidding both domestically and internationally. The main construction projects are scheduled to be bid out in October this year.

　　规模全国最大　技术难度最高    
    二滩电站前期工程全面铺开    
    设计总装机容量３３０万千瓦年发电量１７０亿度
    新华社成都５月１４日电（记者李正杰、凌云）全国最大水电工程——二滩水电站的前期工程已全面铺开，进展顺利。
    二滩水电站位于四川省雅砻江下游，距攀枝花市４０公里。它设计总装机容量为３３０万千瓦，年发电量１７０亿度，是目前我国已建和在建水电站中规模最大、技术难度最高的大型电站，其规模在世界上也是少有的。
    正在这里考察的水电专家们认为，二滩电站的条件得天独厚。雅砻江水能丰沛，年来水量超过黄河，而且淹没损失小，成本低，效益高。按设计规划，二滩电站将于１９９７年建成发电。全部建成后，将大大缓解四川供电紧张的矛盾，促进攀枝花市和西昌地区矿产资源的开发。
    二滩电站的前期工程从１９８７年动工以来，工程进展十分顺利。记者在沸腾的工地看到，５０００多名施工人员正夜以继日地奋战在峻岭峡谷之中。长达４５公里的施工公路已完成８０％，新建的横跨雅砻江的吊桥已派上用场，总长３．５公里的公路隧洞也全部贯通。供电线路和微波通讯设备正在加紧建设，预计今年底可完成全部前期准备工程。
    据介绍，二滩电站是由中央和地方投资并引进部分外资建设的大型电站。电站的各项工程建设全部向国内外公开招标。其中主体工程建设将于今年１０月开标。
