Following the Thomas Cup and Uber Cup, which represent the highest honors for men's and women's team events in the world of badminton, another biennial team competition—the Sudirman Cup World Mixed Team Badminton Championships—will commence its first edition on May 24 in Jakarta. Can the Chinese team, which is participating this time, be the first to engrave the name "China" on the Sudirman Cup? Based on the strength of the participating teams, the Chinese team, which holds the Thomas and Uber Cups, has a superior overall level and a higher chance of standing on the champion's podium than other teams.

However, it should be noted that this cup competition is different from the Thomas and Uber Cups. It combines men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles, using a 5-match 3-win system. The insurance factor for this type of one-on-one encounter is much smaller compared to the Thomas and Uber Cups, which rely on overall strength or the collective power of the East if the West fails.

A total of 30 teams will participate in this cup competition, divided into 7 levels. China, Denmark, Sweden, South Korea, Indonesia, and England are in the A-level group. The top three teams and the bottom three teams will be divided into two groups for the preliminary rounds, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the semi-finals. The winners will then compete for the Sudirman Cup.

The author believes that South Korea and Indonesia will be the main obstacles for the Chinese team in their quest for the cup.

From the records of South Korean players' matches against Chinese players in the past two years, South Korean players have won more matches in all five events than other teams, especially in mixed doubles where they have rarely lost. Although they have won fewer matches in men's doubles, women's doubles, and women's singles, the scores are very close. However, it is surprising that South Korean players have never won a title in Indonesia in the past seven years. The reasons are that they are not adapted to the local climate, the enthusiasm of the audience, and the referee's standards. Relatively speaking, these unfavorable factors have a smaller impact on our players.

Indonesia has the advantage of time, place, and people this time, and their players have excellent records when playing at home, especially in mixed doubles and men's doubles, which have made significant progress recently. To win the championship of this cup competition named after the father of Indonesian badminton, Sudirman, the current chairman of the Indonesian Badminton Association, Sumarno, said: "Indonesia will not allow the Sudirman Cup to fall into the hands of others. If this goal is not achieved, the players and coaches will face the danger of being expelled." The determination to win the championship is evident.

　　谁将首先捧得苏迪曼杯
    ——首届世界羽毛球混合团体赛赛前分析
    继代表世界羽坛男、女团体最高荣誉的汤姆斯杯和尤伯杯之后，又一项两年一度的团体大赛——苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛将于５月２４日在雅加达揭开首届比赛的战幕。那么，中国队此番出战，能否将“中国”字样首先刻在苏迪曼杯上？从参赛各队实力分析，汤杯、尤杯的保持者中国队整体水平突出，登上冠军领奖台的机会超过其它各队。
    但应看到，这个杯赛不同于汤杯和尤杯，它集男女单打、双打和混合双打于一身，采用５盘３胜制。这种各项一碰一的遭遇战的保险系数，要比汤杯和尤杯靠整体水平高或东方不亮西方亮的集团作战小得多。
    参加本次杯赛的共３０个队，分７个级别较量。中国、丹麦、瑞典、南朝鲜、印度尼西亚和英格兰队列为Ａ级队，前三队和后三队分成两组先进行预赛，各组前两名进入交叉半决赛，胜队将争夺苏迪曼杯。
    笔者认为南朝鲜和印尼队将是中国队夺杯征途中主要的拦路虎。
    从南朝鲜选手近两年来同中国选手交手资料看，南朝鲜选手在５个单项上战胜我选手的场数明显高于它队，特别是混双失手较少，而男、女双打及女单虽胜少负多，但负给我球员比分十分接近。但吃惊的是南朝鲜选手７年来从未在印尼夺过标，原因是不适应当地气候、观众的狂热以及裁判尺度等。相对而言，这些不利因素对我国选手影响要小一些。
    印尼队这次占有天时地利人和，且球员在本土作战战绩优异，尤其是印尼的混双和男双近期进步较大。为夺得以印尼羽毛球之父苏迪曼命名的本届杯赛冠军，印尼现任羽协主席苏玛索诺说：“印尼不许苏迪曼杯落入他人之手，不达此目的，球员和教练将面临开除的危险。”夺标决心可见一斑。
