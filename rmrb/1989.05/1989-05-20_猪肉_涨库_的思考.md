Title: Reflections on the Surge in Pig Meat Stockpiles

Zhang Ping wrote in the 5th issue of 1989's "Rural Work Bulletin" that following last year's tight supply of pork, some major cities implemented a rationing system. This year, at the beginning of the year, a nationwide phenomenon of "pig meat stockpiling" emerged. Sichuan had 400,000 tons and Shandong 200,000 tons of pork stockpiled and awaiting transport. It seemed that the once-declining pig farming industry had rebounded, and pork supply had exceeded demand. People no longer had to worry about the difficulty of obtaining meat. However, unknown to many, this surface phenomenon concealed a serious shortage crisis.

The sudden surge in pig meat stockpiles is not a normal economic phenomenon. Before the feed industry's supporting system in China is fully developed, most pigs compete with humans for grain. Last year, China's grain production decreased by 2 billion jin (1 jin = 0.5 kg), and market grain prices rose accordingly. However, the increase in pork prices was much lower than the increase in grain prices. Farmers, without enough grain to feed pigs and unable to afford to feed them, had no choice but to sell and slaughter them. Even sows and young pigs were not spared. As for large-scale pig farms? Due to the tight supply of feed, they were unable to "cook without rice," and regardless of size or fatness, they transferred a large number of marketable pigs to the food departments, causing a temporary "stockpile surge."

### 猪肉“涨库”的思考

　　猪肉“涨库”的思考
    张萍在１９８９年第５期《农村工作通讯》上撰文说，继去年的猪肉供应紧张，一些大城市实行凭票供应后，今年年初出现了全国性的猪肉“涨库”现象，四川４０万吨、山东２０万吨猪肉库存待运，似乎一度跌落的养猪业得以回升了，猪肉一下子供过于求了，人们可以再不必为吃肉难而发愁了。殊不知，这种表面现象的背后掩藏着严重的短缺危机。
    骤发性的猪肉“涨库”，并不是一种正常的经济现象。在我国饲料工业的配套体系还未尽完善之前，大部分的生猪都与人“争粮”，去年全国粮食减产２００亿斤，市场粮价相应抬高，而猪肉价的上涨幅度远低于粮价的上涨幅度，农民无粮喂猪，同时用粮也喂不起猪，迫不得已，就纷纷出售屠宰，甚至连母猪、后备仔猪也在所难免。而一些大型养猪场呢？因饲料供应紧张难为“无米之炊”，也不论大小肥瘦，将商品猪大量转嫁给食品部门，造成一时“涨库”。
