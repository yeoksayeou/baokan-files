	The Central Military Commission has approved additional funding to ensure that troops can subscribe to major central newspapers and magazines such as the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily, despite recent price adjustments.

	The People's Daily, Beijing, May 1st – In the context of newspaper and magazine price adjustments, how can we ensure that cadres and soldiers have access to major central newspapers and magazines such as the People's Daily and the Liberation Army Daily? Recently, with the approval of the Central Military Commission, the General Political Department and the General Logistics Department jointly issued a document deciding to raise the standard for political work funds to subsidize the increased expenses due to price adjustments of newspapers and magazines.

	The document stipulates: Each cadre and in-service staff member will receive an additional 0.8 yuan per month for newspapers and magazines, and each soldier will receive an additional 0.65 yuan per month.

	A responsible person from the relevant departments of the General Political Department pointed out that newspapers and magazines are an important tool for disseminating information, exchanging experiences, and conducting current affairs and policy education for cadres and soldiers. They are also a window for understanding domestic and international affairs. Based on this, in the current situation of tight military funds, we have allocated this subsidy for newspaper and magazine subscriptions.

	He hopes that all levels of leadership will take practical measures to ensure that the funds are used for their intended purpose, strictly prohibiting layer-by-layer deductions or misappropriation.

　　军委批准增拨经费    
    保证部队订阅报刊
    本报北京５月１日讯  在报刊价格调整的情况下，如何保证干部战士看到《人民日报》、《解放军报》等中央主要报刊？最近，经中央军委批准，总政、总后联合下发文件，决定提高政治工作经费标准，以补助因报刊提价而增加的开支。
    文件规定：干部、在编职工每人每月增加报刊费０．８元，战士每人每月增加０．６５元。
    总政有关部门的负责人指出，报刊是传播信息，交流经验，对干部战士进行时事政策教育的一种重要工具，也是了解国内外大事的窗口。基于此，在当前军费紧张的情况下，我们抽出了这笔订阅报刊的补助经费。
    他希望各级领导机关要采取切实措施，做到专款专用，严禁层层克扣或挪用。
