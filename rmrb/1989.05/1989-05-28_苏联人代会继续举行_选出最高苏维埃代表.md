Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th.

The first Soviet People's Congress continued its session last night and this morning, concluding at 11 AM today with the election of all 542 representatives to the Supreme Soviet.

The Supreme Soviet's Chamber of Nationalities, which allocates seats by ethnic regions, and the Chamber of the Union, which elects representatives based on population, each have 271 representatives.

According to the political reform plan adopted at the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 542 representatives to the Supreme Soviet will be elected from 2,250 Soviet People's Representatives. These representatives will serve as members of the Soviet parliament, convening for 8 months each year to discuss and draft important legislative documents, thereby changing the previous practice of the Supreme Soviet meeting only once or twice a year to merely vote by show of hands.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th.

The Soviet People's Congress continued its session today.

The Congress announced the election results for the Supreme Soviet's Chamber of Nationalities and the Chamber of the Union. Former Moscow City Committee First Secretary Yeltsin did not win a seat in the Chamber of Nationalities, receiving the most opposition votes, totaling 964. Sociologist Zaslavskaya and economist Popov, among others, did not win seats in the Chamber of the Union.

Some representatives spoke at the meeting. Historian Afanasyev criticized the Congress for passing resolutions without proper discussion, stating that "some good suggestions were not discussed." He also criticized the chairperson for rushing proceedings, saying that "a Stalin-Brezhnev style Supreme Soviet has been established." Economist Popov also criticized the chairperson's working methods as "not democratic enough." He suggested establishing a "cross-regional, independent parliamentary group" to present supplementary reports on internal and external policy reports and government work reports.

The speeches of these two individuals sparked differing opinions among the representatives. Some representatives partially or fully supported their views, while others accused them of "factional activities" and "attempting to split the Congress." The majority of representatives called for unity and opposed division. They emphasized that the Congress needs to address a large number of urgent issues and that only by mobilizing all forces can the country overcome its difficulties.

Gorbachev, at the request of many representatives, announced the establishment of two committees to investigate the issues of casualties caused by clashes between military police and demonstrators in Tbilisi and the legality of investigators such as Godlyan, who accused Central Committee Politburo member Ligachov of corruption. During a break in the session, Gorbachev told reporters that the Congress's heated debates were filled with concern for revolutionary reforms. He expressed his belief that the Congress would fulfill its mission.

The session will adjourn on May 28th and resume on May 29th.

　　苏联人代会继续举行
    选出最高苏维埃代表
    新华社莫斯科５月２７日电  （记者盛世良）首届苏联人代会昨夜和今晨经过紧张繁忙的投票和计票，于今天上午１１时选出全体最高苏维埃代表，共５４２名。
    按民族地区分配名额的最高苏维埃民族院和根据居民人数划区选举的联盟院各有２７１名代表。
    根据苏共第１９次代表大会确定的政治改革方案，要从２２５０名苏联人民代表中产生５４２名最高苏维埃代表，作为苏联议会成员，每年集中开会议政和研究制订重要立法文件达８个月，以改变以往最高苏维埃一年开一两次会、只履行举手表决的旧习。
    新华社莫斯科５月２７日电　（记者唐修哲）苏联人民代表大会今天继续举行会议。
    今天大会宣布了最高苏维埃民族和联盟院的选举结果。前莫斯科市委第一书记叶利钦在民族院的选举中名落孙山，获反对票最多，达９６４票。社会学家扎斯拉夫斯卡娅、经济学家波波夫等人在联盟院的选举中落选。
    一些代表在会上发言，历史学家阿法纳西耶夫在发言中批评大会通过表决，“使一些好建议得不到讨论”。他还批评会议主持人匆忙行事，“建立了一个斯大林—勃列日涅夫式的最高苏维埃”。经济学家波波夫也对会议主持人的工作方式“不够民主”提出批评。他建议成立一个“跨地区的、独立的议员团”，就内外政策报告和政府工作报告提出补充报告。
    这两人的发言在代表中引起了不同意见。一些代表部分或全部支持他们的意见，另一些代表则指责他们“搞派别活动”，“企图分裂大会”。大多数代表呼吁团结，反对分裂。他们强调，代表大会需要解决大量紧迫的问题，只有动员一切力量才能使国家摆脱困境。
    戈尔巴乔夫应众多代表的要求，宣布成立两个委员会，分别调查第比利斯军警同示威群众冲突造成人员伤亡问题和指控中央政治局委员利加乔夫等有受贿行为的侦查员戈德良等是否违法问题。在会间休息时，戈尔巴乔夫对记者说，大会激烈争论充满着对改革命运的关心。他表示相信，大会将胜任自己的使命。
    会议２８日休会，２９日继续举行。
