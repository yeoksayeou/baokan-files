Qingdao's trial of the re-employment insurance relief system for workers has been fully implemented in state-owned, collective, and private enterprises for permanent workers, contract workers, temporary workers, and seasonal workers. So far, 1,640 unemployed workers have received relief funds from the designated insurance agency, totaling 110,000 yuan.

The main goal of establishing this system is to ensure labor mobility and, to some extent, achieve freedom of employment. According to a report by China Youth Daily, out of the 1,640 workers who received relief funds, more than 700 have found new jobs and moved to new positions. Some have also left behind the "iron rice bowl" and joined the ranks of individual entrepreneurs. A young worker in the city, who was frequently transferred to different positions in the factory, quit his job in frustration. With the help of the labor insurance department, he started his own tailoring business.

It is understood that the structure of the second-time unemployment of industrial workers in Qingdao has not reflected the changes in the industrial structure constrained by market laws. Most of the second-time unemployed are concentrated in urban areas where job opportunities are abundant; in the suburbs, where job opportunities are fewer, the unemployment rate is actually lower. Dirty, hard, and undesirable jobs face recruitment difficulties, and the unemployment rate is also high.

It is worth noting that the unemployment insurance system has promoted labor mobility, but currently, the randomness of workers' mobility is almost as great as the randomness of employment.

Qingdao's relevant departments have stated that there are still many problems to be solved in further improving and standardizing the unemployment insurance system, and it also needs understanding and support from all sectors of society.

### 以保障劳动力流动为目标  青岛推行待业保险制  领救济金者上千人　盲目流动也有增加

　　以保障劳动力流动为目标    
    青岛推行待业保险制    
    领救济金者上千人　盲目流动也有增加
    本报讯  青岛市试行的在业职工重新待业保险救济制度，最近在全民、集体、私营企业的固定工、合同工、临时工、季节工中全面推开。到目前为止，已有１６４０名待业职工从专设的保险机构领取救济金，总金额１１万元。
    建立这项制度的主要目标，是保障劳动力流动，在一定程度上实现择业自由。据中国青年报报道，１６４０名领取救济金的职工中，已有７００多人重新就业，流动到新的岗位上。也有人从此告别“铁饭碗”，加入个体户大军。该市一名青年职工，在厂里被频繁调换岗位，一气之下自动失业，在劳动保险部门帮助下，干起了个体服装裁剪。
    据了解，青岛市产业工人二度待业的结构比例，并没有反映出受市场规律制约的产业结构的变化。二度待业者，绝大多数出现在就业机会多的市区；郊县就业机会少，待业率反而低。脏、累、差的行业，招工难，待业率也高。
    值得注意的是，待业保险制度促进了劳动力流动，但目前，职工流动的盲目性几乎和就业的盲目性一样大。
    青岛市有关部门表示，待业保险制度进一步完善，走向规范化、社会化，还有许多问题需要解决，同时也需要社会各方面的理解和支持。
