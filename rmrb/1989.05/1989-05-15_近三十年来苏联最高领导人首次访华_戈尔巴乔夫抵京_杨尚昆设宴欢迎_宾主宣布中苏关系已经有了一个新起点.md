Nearly thirty years have passed since a Soviet leader last visited China. Today at noon, Mikhail Gorbachev, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and his wife Raisa arrived in Beijing by special plane.

When Gorbachev's Ilyushin-62 special plane slowly taxied to a stop next to the stairs, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen boarded the plane to welcome the Soviet dignitaries.

Gorbachev then descended the stairs and stepped onto the red-carpeted Chinese soil, beginning his four-day official visit. Waiting there were Chinese leaders including Chairman Yang Shangkun, who warmly shook hands with Gorbachev and exchanged greetings.

Gorbachev is visiting China at the invitation of Chairman Yang Shangkun. This is the first visit by a Soviet leader to China since 1959, marking the beginning of a new era in Sino-Soviet relations.

Accompanying Gorbachev on his visit were CPSU Politburo member and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, CPSU Politburo member and Secretary responsible for international policy Alexander Yakovlev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Committee Maslyukov, and Minister of Health Chazov, who all arrived in Beijing on the same plane.

Chairman Yang Shangkun hosted the welcoming ceremony at the capital airport. A 21-gun salute accompanied by the national anthems of the Soviet Union and China echoed over the capital airport. Subsequently, under the escort of Chairman Yang Shangkun, Gorbachev inspected the ceremonial troops of the army, navy, and air force.

Today's welcoming ceremony was originally scheduled to be held at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People. Due to a large number of students fasting and petitioning, it was changed to the capital airport.

Gorbachev delivered a written speech at the capital airport (full text on page 2).

Those who went to the airport to welcome the guests included Vice Premiers Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, and Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin. Staff of the Soviet Embassy in China also went to the airport to welcome the guests.

This evening, the banquet hall of the Great Hall of the People was brightly lit. Chairman of the People's Republic of China Yang Shangkun hosted a grand banquet to welcome Mikhail Gorbachev, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet and General Secretary of the CPSU Central Committee, and his entourage.

When Gorbachev and his wife Raisa Gorbacheva arrived at the banquet hall accompanied by Chairman Yang Shangkun, the orchestra played the "Welcome March." Gorbachev and his wife Raisa shook hands with Premier Li Peng and his wife Zhu Lin, as well as various department heads and prominent figures from different sectors who were waiting there. When he learned that the singer Guo Shujin had studied in the Soviet Union, he said, "It's like meeting an old acquaintance." When he found out that actors Liu Qi and Yang Chunxia from the Beijing Opera House would perform "Stealing the Immortal Grass" and "Autumn River" for him on the 17th, he smiled and expressed his great pleasure.

In his welcome speech, Chairman Yang Shangkun said that over the past years, the relationship between the two countries has gone through a tortuous process, and today, we have reached a new starting point. He emphasized that today, the two great neighboring countries, China and the Soviet Union, are ending the past and opening up the future, exploring the establishment of a new type of relationship based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

In his reply, Gorbachev stressed that this meeting was hard-won and required both sides to show wisdom and a sense of responsibility, persistently overcoming the negative accumulated baggage and prejudices that have long weighed heavily on the relations between the two countries. He used the Chinese expression "three agreements" to express his views on the development of Sino-Soviet relations, namely, agreeing to mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence; agreeing to cooperate in the economic and cultural fields; and agreeing to cooperate with each other in solving urgent international issues at present.

Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, CPSU Politburo member Yakovlev, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Maslyukov, Minister of Health Chazov, and Soviet Ambassador to China Troyanovsky, as well as other accompanying personnel, attended the banquet.

Those who attended the banquet to accompany the guests included Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, Vice Premiers Tian Jiyun and Wu Xueqian, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Hu Sheng, President of the China-Soviet Friendship Association Wu Xiuquan, State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong, Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, and Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yu Hongliang.

The banquet lasted nearly two hours to the music of both countries. When the banquet ended, Chairman Yang Shangkun presented Gorbachev with two large porcelain plates engraved with the likenesses of Gorbachev and Raisa. The guests expressed their deep gratitude and said they would cherish them forever.

    戈尔巴乔夫随即走下舷梯踏上铺有红地毯的中国国土，开始了他为期４天的正式访问。等候在那里的国家主席杨尚昆等中国领导人迎上前去，与戈尔巴乔夫等热烈握手，互致问候。
    戈尔巴乔夫主席是应杨尚昆主席的邀请对我国进行正式访问的。这是苏联最高领导人自１９５９年以来首次访问中国，标志着中苏两国关系史上一个新时期的开端。

    今天的欢迎仪式按原定计划是在人民大会堂东门外广场举行的。由于广场有大批学生绝食请愿而改在首都机场举行。

    杨尚昆主席在宴会上致欢迎词，他说，在过去的岁月中两国关系经历了曲折的历程，今天，我们走到了一个新的起点。他强调指出，今天中苏两大邻国结束过去，开辟未来，探讨在和平共处五项原则基础上建立新型关系。（讲话全文见二版）
    戈尔巴乔夫在致答词时强调，这次会晤来之不易，要求双方表现出智慧和责任感，坚持不懈地克服多年来沉重地笼罩在两国关系上的消极的积垢和成见。他仿照中国的表述习惯，用“三个赞成”来表达他对发展中苏关系的看法，即赞成相互尊重主权和领土完整，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利与和平共处；赞成在经济和文化方面进行合作；赞成两国在解决当前迫切的国际问题时相互协作。（讲话全文见二版）
