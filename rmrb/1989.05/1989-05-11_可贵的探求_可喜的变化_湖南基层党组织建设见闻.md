Recently, the reporter conducted interviews in Changsha, Yueyang, Yiyang, and Changde in Hunan, investigating how to strengthen grassroots organizations and play the role of party members in the new era. It was found that party organizations at all levels are striving to explore and seek, and have made some gratifying progress.

Democratic Evaluation of Party Members Strengthens Party Building

Establishing a democratic evaluation system for party members is an important measure to strictly manage the party and improve the quality of party members. It is an effective method to regularly educate, manage, and supervise party members, and it is of great significance to fully play the advantages of the party.

The proportion of unqualified party members in pilot units is 5.26%. Hunan Province has been carrying out the pilot work of democratic evaluation of party members and handling unqualified party members for more than a year. In the 528 units that have completed the pilot work, a total of 5,284 party members were handled, accounting for 5.26% of the total number of party members. Among them, 4,262 unqualified party members were handled, accounting for 4.24% of the total number of party members in the pilot units; 202 were expelled from the party, 677 were given other disciplinary actions, 100 had their probationary party member status revoked, and 54 probationary party members had their probationary period extended. The total number of party members expelled was 1,965, accounting for 1.96% of the total number of party members in the pilot units.

According to the analysis, the main manifestations of unqualified party members in rural grassroots organizations are not playing the role of party members; in cities, government agencies, and among leading cadres, the main manifestations of unqualified party members are using power for personal gain, using position for personal gain, bribery, embezzlement, and excessive occupation, or due to serious bureaucratism and subjectivism, causing major decisions to fail, resulting in irreparable major losses to state and collective property, and so on.

For example, a financial director of a certain factory, during his probationary period, used his position to embezzle public funds and national treasury bonds, privately handle public fund interest income, occupy monetary time value, and arbitrarily lend out and borrow large amounts of public funds. After the audit department confirmed this, he was stripped of his probationary party member status during the democratic evaluation of party members.

There was also a party member who, for more than two years, refused to contact the organization without valid reasons, and still did not return despite repeated urgings from the party organization. According to the party constitution, the party organization expelled him.

Why is the proportion of unqualified party members so high? Yueyang City summarized three main reasons through investigations in rural townships:

- The entrance gate is not strictly controlled. Since the founding of the country, there have been many political movements, and each time a batch of party members was developed. Yueyang City alone developed 200,000 party members during the "Four Cleanups" movement. In Huaichong County with less than 400,000 people, 11,000 party members were developed. In this democratic evaluation of party members, a township handled 94 unqualified party members, of which 61% were from the "Four Cleanups."

- Education and management are not strict. Since the implementation of the responsibility system in rural areas, the education and management of party members have been relaxed, making some rural party members think: "Growing a good plot of responsibility land, finding ways to make more money, educating children not to be troublesome, is a good party member." Some party members even say: "Party member or not, it's just a difference of 5 fen (cents)" (rural party members pay 5 fen party dues). They completely forget that the Communist Party is the vanguard organization of the working class and have not played the role of party members.

- Organizational handling is not strict. In the past, the emphasis was on "strict ideological criticism and lenient organizational handling," and those who did not play the role of party members were handled too leniently. In Pingjiang County's Lishan Township, 4 party members who did not believe in Marxism became monks, and during the rectification, the party organization repeatedly went to persuade them to return, and registered 3 who returned. This overly lenient approach was even introduced as a positive experience during the rectification.

Both "grass-shoe" party members and "leather-shoe" party members are evaluated. Starting from the top, starting from the leadership, starting from the agencies. This is the experience summarized by the Yiyang Municipal Party Committee in the pilot work of democratic evaluation of party members and handling unqualified party members.

Initially, the Yiyang Municipal Party Committee mainly conducted pilot work in rural areas. Some rural party members were not satisfied: "You can only handle 'grass-shoe' party members and not 'leather-shoe' (cadres) party members." After investigation, it was found that the proportion of unqualified party members in agency party members and leading cadre party members was also high. People reflected that unqualified party members in rural areas do not play the role of party members, affecting only one person; unqualified party members in agencies and among leading cadres affect a large number of people. This made the Municipal Party Committee realize that strict party management must first start from the agencies and leading cadres.

Since the beginning of this year, they have successively carried out the work of democratic evaluation of party members and proper handling of unqualified party members in the regional and county (city) direct agencies. Currently, Nanzhou, Anhua, Yuanjiang, and Yiyang City have all completed the work, and Taojiang County, Yiyang County, and regional direct agencies are fully deploying the work.

All county-level party organization leaders in Anhua County, as well as party organization leaders of various departments, offices, commissions, and bureaus, and party committee secretaries of various work committees and townships, participated in the party member evaluation activities of their respective branches as ordinary party members. In the county's direct agencies, 339 branches and 5,083 party members evaluated 97 unqualified and basically unqualified party members, and 612 were given a deadline to correct their behavior.

The effect of the pilot work is good. Party members reflected, "The rectification was like taking a warm bath, handling unqualified party members added some spice." After the evaluation, qualified party members felt a sense of honor, and those who were not so qualified felt more pressure. The masses reflected that "party members have changed," and "the atmosphere in the agencies has changed." Last year, when the Yiyang region was flooded, party members and leading cadres took the lead in day and night rescue and disaster relief, and the masses happily said: "In times of difficulty, rely on party members."

Handling unqualified party members is fraught with difficulties. The Changde Municipal Party Committee reflected that handling unqualified party members encountered ten major difficulties: party organization leaders are afraid of offending people, afraid of not holding the policy and making "leftist" mistakes, afraid of affecting economic work, afraid of handling others today and being handled by others tomorrow; party members have grievances, indifference, and fear; the party constitution's party member standards are too general, and other policies are not coordinated, making it difficult to define problems; production standards and party member standards are difficult to unify; agency and public institution relationships are complex, cannot be moved, and power is great, cannot be offended; it is difficult to handle leading cadre party members; economic problems are difficult to investigate, mainly because those in the know are not willing to provide evidence; general problems are difficult to handle, a unit had 20 party members who did not pay dues last year, a village had 30 party members who all participated in gambling, and it is difficult to handle them...

These difficulties are not solved, and the handling effect is difficult to guarantee.

Reforms in cadre work add vitality to the party

Improving the probationary period system for leading cadres. On July 1, 1985, the Yiyang Municipal Party Committee decided to implement a probationary period system for newly promoted leading cadres in regional direct departments, offices, commissions, bureaus, and companies. After a year of practice, the Municipal Party Committee decided to expand this method to all county-level administrative agencies and enterprises in the region. Starting from October 1, 1986, all newly promoted cadres, according to legal procedures, were appointed in the form of probation, acting, or assistant. For those who do not need to be appointed through legal procedures, they are all appointed in the form of probation; for those who need to be appointed through legal procedures, the principal is appointed in the form of acting (such as acting county magistrate), and the deputy is appointed in the form of assistant (such as county magistrate assistant); the appointment of probationary period cadres needs to be approved by the people's congress at the county (city) level, and first needs to be deliberated by the people's congress, and then reported for approval according to the cadre management authority. The probationary period is generally one year. During the probationary period, they enjoy the same political treatment as cadres at the same level, but do not enjoy the corresponding salary and housing treatment. After the probationary period is over and they are evaluated as qualified, they will be officially appointed.

The probationary period system is conducive to opening up the concept of cadres being able to go up and down; it broadens the channels for using people and increases the courage to use people, which is conducive to boldly selecting and using talents; it strengthens democratic supervision, which is conducive to retaining the best and eliminating the worst, and overcoming mistakes in the use of people; it enhances the spirit of cadres' striving for progress, which is conducive to the training and growth of talents.

Introducing the competitive mechanism into the election of party branch secretaries. In the past, rural areas established party branches based on their territory, and party branch members had to be from the same township and locality. This led to some places having the problem of "no tigers in the mountains, monkeys become kings"; some party branches "take turns being in charge," and almost all party members have taken turns being the branch secretary. The Changde Municipal Party Committee reformed the election of party branch secretaries.

- Change from upper-level appointment to consultation and recommendation. Party members can recommend, and the masses can suggest. The examination is both within the party and outside the party.

- Bidding and election. Some use self-recommendation, speeches and debates, and differential elections; some publish the conditions for party branch secretaries and bid for election. The entire city has 68 party branches doing this, 38 village branch secretaries are elected, and 25 village branch secretaries are not elected.

- "Import" or dispatch from outside, breaking the territorial boundaries. Some rural party branches cannot elect a branch secretary, and some do not want to be elected after being elected. Taojiang County has 16 party branches without a branch secretary. Last winter, the Municipal Party Committee began to use the method of selecting and dispatching from county and township cadres.

After the reform, the age structure and cultural knowledge structure of village party branch secretaries are more reasonable.

Grassroots cadres need understanding and support

Vice Minister of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee Organization Department Song Tingtong told the reporter: Society and public opinion do not understand and care enough about grassroots cadres. Now many people do not want to be party and government cadres. If this continues, how can we talk about political advantages?

According to the investigation, a considerable number of rural party branch secretaries in Hunan Province have unstable emotions, are not willing to work, and request to resign. According to the investigation of 1,276 village party branch secretaries in 11 counties and cities such as Hengyang, Hengdong, and Shaodong, 409 rural party branch secretaries requested to resign, accounting for 32% of rural party branch secretaries. Dong'an County conducted a questionnaire survey of 504 village party branch secretaries, and 23% did not want to be party branch secretaries. Longshan County had 91 village party branch secretaries whose terms expired last August, and 79 of them did not want to be re-elected. Nanzhou County's Hekou Township's 18 villages and Huangshi Township's 10 villages in Miluo City did not have a single party branch secretary willing to continue. In Anhua County, in the past two years, 203 party and government cadres at or above the township party committee level have submitted written and verbal resignations, including 59 district, township, and county magistrates and 54 deputy directors or above in county direct agencies.

Why are there so many party and government grassroots cadres resigning? The main reasons are:

- Some village party branch secretaries do not understand the current situation and policies. Some grassroots cadres think that "reform and opening up have confused people's minds and disrupted social order." "The deeper the reform, the harder it is to be a party branch secretary." Many rural party branch secretaries feel that policies change quickly, and they do not know what to do. The masses suffer losses due to policy changes and vent their anger on village cadres. Rural party branch secretaries generally reflect: "We are 'scapegoats,' cadres who bear the brunt."

- The working conditions at the grassroots level are harsh, the tasks are complex, and the difficulties are great. Grassroots cadres directly deal with the masses, and it is difficult to complete the tasks from above, implement family planning indicators, and resolve civil disputes. Village cadres often get beaten, scolded, and driven away for these three tasks. Some cadres "cannot go out during the day and cannot sleep well at night."

- They are afraid of retaliation. The position of a village party branch secretary is "a leader at the front and a follower at the back," with pressure from above and below, standing at the focal point of conflicts. Some village cadres, when they work, hurt some people's feelings, often suffer various forms of retaliation, and some village cadres live in fear every day.

- Low economic treatment. According to investigations and statistics from counties such as Nanzhou, Anhua, and Jiahe, the annual salary income standard for rural party branch secretaries is above 500 yuan, accounting for 3.8%; 400 to 500 yuan, accounting for 21.05%; 300 to 400 yuan, accounting for 50.8%; below 300 yuan, accounting for 24.35%. Some retired old village cadres have more difficult lives, family complaints, and are cold-shouldered, with a bleak future.

- Some village party branch secretaries' own qualities do not adapt to the new situation. First, they are older, have lower cultural and technical qualities, lack knowledge of commodity production and agricultural science and technology, and cannot lead the masses to get rich; second, their work methods are rough, their work abilities are low, they are used to past coercive commands, and they do not understand or are not used to methods of inspiration, guidance, mediation, and consultation.

Strengthening the understanding and support for grassroots cadres, helping them solve difficulties, understanding their certain deviations and mistakes, improving their treatment, and strengthening their training and improving their qualities are very important for completing various tasks of the party in rural areas.

　　可贵的探求　可喜的变化   
    ——湖南基层党组织建设见闻
    本报记者  尹品端
    最近，记者在湖南长沙、岳阳、益阳、常德等地、市采访，对新时期如何搞好基层组织建设和发挥党员作用进行了调查，发现各级党组织都在努力探讨和求索，并取得了一些可喜的进展。
    民主评议党员加强了党的建设
    建立民主评议党员制度是从严治党、提高党员素质的一项重要措施，是对党员进行经常性教育、管理和监督的有效方法，对充分发挥党的优势具有重要意义。
    试点单位不合格党员占党员总数的５．２６％。湖南省开展民主评议党员、处置不合格党员的试点工作已经一年多了。在已完成试点工作的５２８个单位中，共处理党员５２８４名，占党员总数的５．２６％。其中处置不合格党员４２６２名，占试点单位党员总数的４．２４％；开除党籍的２０２名，给予其他党纪处分的６７７名；取消预备党员资格的１００名；预备党员被延长预备期的５４名。出党人数共计１９６５名，占试点单位党员总数的１．９６％。
    据分析，农村基层不合格党员的主要表现形式是不发挥党员作用；城市、机关、领导干部中不合格党员的主要表现形式是以权谋私、以职谋私、行贿受贿、贪污多占，或因严重官僚主义、主观主义而造成决策失误，使国家、集体财产遭受无法挽回的重大损失，等等。
    如某厂财务科长，在党员预备期内，利用职务之便，私自挪用公款和国库券，私自处理公款利息收入，侵占货币时间价值，擅自借出和借入巨额公款。经审计部门确认后，在民主评议党员中，他被取消了预备党员资格。
    还有一位党员，在长达两年多的时间里，无正当理由拒绝与组织联系，在党组织多次敦促下，仍不回来。按党章规定，党组织将他除名。
    不合格党员的比例为何如此之大？岳阳市通过在农村乡镇进行调查，归纳出三个主要原因：
    ——入口关把得不严。建国以来，经历了多次政治运动，几乎每次都要突击发展一批党员。岳阳市仅“四清”运动中就发展了２０万党员。不到４０万人口的华容县，发展党员竟达１１０００多人。在这次民主评议党员中，一个乡处置不合格党员９４名，其中“四清”中入党的占６１％。
    ——教育、管理不严。农村推行责任制以来，对党员的教育、管理一度放松，使一些农村党员认为：“种好一份责任田，想方设法多赚钱，教育子女不讨嫌，就是一个好党员。”有的党员还说什么：“党员不党员，就差５分钱”（农村党员交５分钱党费）。完全忘记了共产党是工人阶级的先锋队组织，没有发挥党员作用。
    ——组织处理不严。过去片面强调“思想批评从严，组织处理从宽”，对那些不起党员作用的党员处理过宽。平江县栗山乡有４名党员不信仰马克思主义去当了和尚，整党期间，党组织一而再、再而三去做工作，说服他们回来，对三个回来的进行了党员登记。对这种失之过宽的做法，还作为整党中的正面经验加以介绍。
    既评“穿草鞋”的党员，也评“穿皮鞋”的党员。从上面评起，从领导评起，从机关评起。这是益阳地委在民主评议党员、处置不合格党员试点工作中总结出来的经验。
    最初，益阳地委主要在农村进行试点，有的农村党员不服：你们不能只处置“穿草鞋”的党员，不处置“穿皮鞋”（干部）的党员。经过调查，机关党员、领导干部党员不合格的同样不少。人们反映，农村不合格党员不发挥党员作用，影响的是一个人；机关、领导干部中的不合格党员则影响一大片人。这使地委认识到，从严治党，首先必须从机关严起，从领导干部严起。
    今年年初开始，他们先后在地区和县（市）直属机关开展民主评议党员、妥善处置不合格党员的工作。目前南县、安化、沅江、益阳市已全部结束，桃江县、益阳县、地直机关正在全面铺开。
    安化县县委委员和县各部、办、委、局的党组织负责人，各工委、乡镇党委书记，都以普通党员身份参加了所在支部的党员评议活动。全县县直机关３３９个支部，５０８３名党员，评出不合格党员和基本不合格党员９７名，限期改正的６１２名。
    试点的效果是好的。党员反映，“整党洗了个温水澡，处置不合格党员加了红辣椒”。经过评议，合格党员有了光荣感，不那么合格的党员增加了压力。群众反映“党员变了”，“机关风气变了”。去年益阳地区洪水泛滥，党员、领导干部带头日夜抢险救灾，群众高兴地说：“困难的时候靠党员。”
    处置不合格党员困难重重。常德市委反映，处置不合格党员遇到了十大难题：党组织负责人怕得罪人，怕把不住政策犯“左”的错误，怕影响经济工作，怕今天处置别人，明天别人处置自己；党员有不服气情绪、淡漠心理和恐惧心理；党章规定的党员条件太原则，其他政策不配套，问题难定性；生产力标准与党员标准难统一；机关事业单位关系多，惹不动，权势大，惹不起；领导干部党员难处置；经济问题难查清，主要是知情人不愿提供证据；普遍性问题难下手，一个单位去年一年２０名党员没交党费，一个村３０名党员都参加打牌赌博，处置起来，左右为难……这些难点不解决，处置效果难保证。
    干部工作改革增添了党的活力
    完善领导干部试用期制度。１９８５年７月１日，益阳地委作出决定，对地直部、办、委、局和公司新提拔的领导干部实行试用期制度。经过一年实践，地委决定将这个办法扩大到全区所有的县处级行政机关及企事业单位。自１９８６年１０月１日起，凡是新提拔的干部，根据法律程序，分别采取试用、代理、助理等形式任职。对不需经过法律程序任命的，一律采用试用形式；需经法律程序任命的，正职采取代理形式（如代理县长），副职采取助理形式（如县长助理）；对试用期干部的任命，需经县（市）人大通过的，先要人大审议，再按干部管理权限上报审批。试用期一般为一年。试用期间，享受同级干部的政治待遇，但不享受相应的工资、住房待遇，待期满评定合格后再行确定。
    试用期制度有利于从观念上开创干部能上能下的新风；开拓了用人渠道和增大了用人的胆量，有利于大胆选拔和使用人才；加强了民主监督，有利于留优汰劣，克服用人上的失误；增强了干部奋发进取的精神，有利于人才的锻炼成长。
    把竞争机制引入党支部书记的改选中。过去，农村以属地建立党支部，党支部成员必须是本乡本土的。这样，有的地方便出现了“山中无老虎、猴子称大王”的弊病；有的党支部“轮流坐庄”，所有党员几乎都轮流当过支部书记，党支部成了“书记处”。对此，常德市委对选举党支部书记作了改革。
    ——改上级指定为协商推荐。党员可以推荐，群众可以提建议，考察既在党内，又在党外。
    ——招标、竞选。有的采取党员自荐、演讲答辩、差额选举；有的把党支部书记的条件公布，招标竞选。全市有６８个党支部这样做了，３８个村支部书记当选，２５个村支部书记落选。
    ——由外“引进”或派进，打破属地界限。有的农村党支部选不出支部书记来，有的选出后不愿当，桃江县有１６个党支部没有支部书记。去年冬天开始，市委采用从县、乡干部中选派的办法。
    经过改革，村党支部书记的年龄结构和文化知识结构更加趋向合理。
    基层干部需要理解和支持
    湖南省委组织部副部长宋廷同对记者说：社会和舆论对基层干部理解和关心不够。现在不少人不愿当党政干部，长此以往，还谈什么政治优势？
    据调查，湖南省有相当一部分农村党支部书记情绪不稳定，工作不安心，要求辞职。据衡阳、衡东、邵东等１１个县市对１２７６名村支部书记的调查，有４０９名农村支部书记提出辞职要求，占农村支部书记的３２％。东安县对５０４名村支部书记作问卷调查，不想当的占２３％。龙山县去年８月届满的９１个村支部书记，有７９人不愿连任。南县河口乡１８个村、汨罗市黄市乡１０个村，没有一个支部书记愿意继续干。安化县近两年来书面和口头提出辞职的，乡镇党委委员以上的党政干部达２０３人，其中区、乡、镇长５９人，县直机关副局长以上干部５４人。
    为什么会有这样多的党政基层干部辞职呢？主要原因是：
    ——部分村支部书记对当前的形势和政策不理解。基层干部中有些人认为“改革开放把人心搞乱了，把社会秩序搞坏了”。“改革越深化，支书越难当”。不少农村支部书记感到政策变化快，工作无所适从，群众因政策多变吃了亏，把怨气发泄到村干部身上。农村支部书记普遍反映：“我们是‘出气筒’，受气干部。”
    ——基层工作条件艰苦，头绪繁杂，难度大。基层干部直接同群众打交道，上面的任务难完成、计划生育指标难实现、民事纠纷难解决。村干部为了这三项工作而遭打、挨骂、被轰是常事。有的干部“白天出不了门，晚上睡不好觉”。
    ——担心打击报复。村支书职位是“兵头将尾”，工作是上压下顶，站在矛盾的焦点上。有的村干部抓工作，伤害了一些人的感情，常常遭到各种打击报复，一些村干部提心吊胆过日子。
    ——经济待遇低。据南县、安化、嘉禾等县调查统计，农村支部书记年工资收入标准在５００元以上的占３．８％；４００至５００元的占２１．０５％；３００至４００元的占５０．８％；３００元以下的占２４．３５％。一些卸任的老村干部生活更加困难，家庭埋怨，受尽冷落，晚景不佳。
    ——部分村支部书记自身素质与新形势不适应。一是年龄偏高，文化技术素质偏低，缺少商品生产知识和农业科学技术，不能带领群众致富；二是工作方法粗、工作能力低，习惯于过去强迫命令那一套，对启发、疏导、调解、协商对话等办法不懂得、不习惯。
    加强理解和支持基层干部的工作，帮助他们排忧解难，体谅他们的某些偏差和失误，提高他们的待遇，下力气进行培训并提高他们的素质，对完成党在农村的各项任务是非常重要的。
