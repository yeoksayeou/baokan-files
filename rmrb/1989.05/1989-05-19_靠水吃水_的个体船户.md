According to statistics from water police departments along the Yangtze River in Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai, from the beginning of last year to the beginning of April this year, over 1,000 cases of theft have been solved, with more than 30 million kilograms of stolen grain, cooking oil, and other items seized, as well as over 500 televisions, bicycles, washing machines, and other items. Most of these cases were committed by individual boat operators.

In the past two years, some individual boat operators have resorted to various means to steal goods from their clients and then sell the stolen goods on the spot. For example, on March 25, a crew member from an individual boat team traveling from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to Wuhan conspired to steal over 4,000 kilograms of rice from the client. Upon arriving in Wuhan, they quickly resold the rice. It is imperative to strictly manage individual water transport vessels and protect the rights of clients. This cannot be overlooked.

　　“靠水吃水”的个体船户
    据长江沿线的重庆、武汉、南京、上海等水上公安部门统计：去年初至今年４月上旬，已破获各类盗窃案件１０００多起，收缴被偷窃的粮食、食油等物３０００多万公斤，电视机、自行车、洗衣机等物５００多台（件）。这些案件，多为个体船户所为。
    近两年来，一些个体船户竟不择手段，偷窃货主的货物，再将偷来的货物就地卖掉。如３月２５日，长江上游驶向武汉的一个体船队船员，合伙窃取货主大米４０００多公斤，抵达武汉后，很快将大米转手了。严格管理水上运输的个体船只，保障货主权益，不容忽视。
