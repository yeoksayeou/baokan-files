	On Not Quarrelling
	Ma Weimin

	The short article "A Good Way to Settle Disputes" (published in the April 13th, 8th edition of this newspaper) by Fang Cheng is as thought-provoking as his cartoons. Inspired by his troubles while riding a bicycle, I would like to talk about my adventurous experiences driving a car abroad, but with a different theme: not quarrelling.

	During my six years living in Paris, I have seen street demonstrations, heard mutual accusations in the parliament, and watched heated debates on television. However, I must honestly say that in daily life, I have never witnessed a fiery quarrel. Personal experiences are often accidental. But philosophy books say that there is necessity within chance.

	Let me start with what I have witnessed. Paris has many cars, and the most daunting place to drive is the Place de l'Étoile. The square radiates outwards with 12 streets, all of which have both inbound and outbound traffic. Cars of various colors constantly swirl around the Arc de Triomphe, making it impossible to tell where each one is heading. We Chinese call this "herding pigs." At that time, I lived near the Place de l'Étoile and was forced to navigate the car vortex countless times. Although I never caused an accident, I have seen many, but none ended in a quarrel. Minor bumps and scrapes, the responsible party would make a gesture of apology, and the other party would be satisfied. At most, they would tap their forehead with a finger, implying that the responsible party was crazy. If the collision was more serious, both parties would get out of the car to fill out an accident report. No quarreling. They often shook hands and said goodbye.

	Initially, I thought this was just about being civilized and maintaining public morality. Later, especially after experiencing a car accident myself, I realized that there was more to this non-quarreling.

	Once, while driving to a small town north of Paris, I accidentally went the wrong way. When I tried to turn back, a loaded truck roared up from behind, its over a meter-high tires scraping my car heavily. Both drivers quickly got out of their cars. Seeing that we were both unharmed, they sighed in relief. We exchanged greetings and found the mandatory accident report form to fill out. The form had a pleasant name: "Friendship Negotiation Record." The cover had text such as: "Do not get excited or blame each other, fill out the form calmly..." After filling out the form, we parted amicably. The two drivers waited until we started our damaged car before heading back to their truck.

	The accident was my fault, but the other party did not blame me at all. In fact, there was no need to blame. The 600-plus regulations of the traffic law were clear, and the information required on the accident report was all "hard parameters": surrounding traffic signs, the relative positions and damaged parts of the vehicles, etc. Filling out the form usually determined the responsibility, leaving little room for argument. Moreover, all cars are insured, so even if there were disputes, the drivers did not need to argue; instead, their respective insurance companies would negotiate. The responsible party's insurance would cover the repairs. Everything was done according to the rules, with no room for ambiguity.

	Two years ago, during a United Nations conference in Geneva, our enthusiastic colleague, Little Li, drove us to his place for a gathering one evening. As we passed an intersection, we collided with a car coming from the right. The other driver was a young Swiss man, very friendly, who muttered that he still had a couple of hundred kilometers to go. We apologized repeatedly. So, let's fill out the "Friendship Negotiation Record," but neither of them had one. We then asked him to send us the repair bill later, and our insurance company would reimburse it. The young man hesitated for a moment and agreed. We watched him start his car and leave. A car accident was thus settled without a single argument.

	Incidentally, there was another unrelated incident. We once had a British student living in our modest apartment. He often invited friends over for all-night parties, making it impossible for others to sleep. I had to go to his place to reason with him. He was quite obedient, apologized, and rarely made noise again. Later, I heard from neighbors that France has regulations stating that after 10 PM, family entertainment should not disturb others; just one phone call, and the police would come to stop it. There was no need for neighbors to have unpleasant arguments.

	The above few trivial incidents may or may not illustrate this principle: governing modern society, this human group, requires the rule of law. Public morality can only be promoted on the basis of the rule of law. With regulations, the public has a standard for resolving disputes on their own, moving towards the true meaning of democracy: the public governing themselves. Without the rule of law and merely advocating public morality, or calling for upright officials and strong political leaders, would fall into idealism, either naively or deceitfully.

### 话说不吵架
马为民

专栏：世情小议

　　话说不吵架
    马为民
    方成同志的短文《息事良方之一》（本报４月１３日第八版）就像他的漫画那样，耐人玩味。有感于他骑自行车遇到的麻烦，我想说说在国外开汽车经历的冒险，只是话题相反：不吵架。
    客居巴黎６年当中，见过街头的示威冲突，听过议会里的相互攻讦，看过电视上的激烈争论，但是说句良心话，在日常生活中从未见过火辣辣的吵架场景。个人经历总带偶然性。可哲学书上说，偶然之中有必然。
    且从目睹的说起。巴黎车多难开，而最令人发怵的地方莫过于凯旋门广场。广场向外辐射出１２条大街，１２个街口都有进有出。五颜六色的汽车整天围着凯旋门横七竖八地蠕动，谁也说不准它们各自在朝哪儿开。咱们中国人圈子里称这叫“拱小猪”。其时，我寄居凯旋门附近，被迫在广场的车辆涡流中“拱”了不知几百次，虽未“拱”成“遭遇战”，见过的倒不少，可没有吵架的。轻微的磕磕碰碰，责任一方做个致歉的手势，对方也就满足了，他至多用手指敲敲自己的太阳穴，意思是说责任一方发疯了。如果磕碰较重，双方就下车填事故单。不吵架。多半还握手告别。
    起初，我只想到这是讲文明，守公德。后来，特别是亲身经历过撞车事故之后，才发觉这不吵架当中还有别的学问。
    一次，驾车去巴黎北部一个小镇，不留心走过了。到我自以为可以开回头要转车时，一辆载重卡车从后面呼啸而至，它那一米多高的轮胎把我的车身狠狠“擦”了一下。两位司机急忙下车跑来。待看到我们安然无恙，他俩才松了口气。我们互致问候，找出驾车人必备的事故单填写。单子的名称很好听：《友好协商笔录表》，封面印着诸如此类的文字：不要激动和相互指责，冷静地填写……填写完毕，我们友好地告别。两位司机等我们启动了破车，才朝他们的载重卡车走去。
    事故责任在我，对方却没有指责半句。其实也用不着指责。道路法的６００多条规定一清二楚，事故单上要填的也全是“硬参数”：周围的交通标志，事故车辆的相对位置及损伤部位等。填完单子通常就等于判明了责任，没更多好争的。再说，所有汽车都是投保的，即使有争议，也不用当事双方争，而是留待各自的保险公司会商，哪方受保人的责任，哪方掏钱修车。一切照章办事，没有半点含糊。
    前年，我们在日内瓦参加联合国会议期间的一个晚上，热情的同行小李开车接我们去他处小聚。车过一路口时，跟右手的来车撞上了。对方是个瑞士青年，很和善，喃喃地说他还有一两百公里的路要赶。我们连连致歉。那么，填《友好协商笔录表》吧，可他俩都忘带了。于是，我们请他随后把修车发票寄来，由我们的保险公司报销。青年人犹豫片刻，同意了。我们目送他启动上路。一场撞车事故就这样没争一句就了结了。
    顺便说件跟撞车无关的事。我们陋壁住过一位英国留学生。他经常招同伴来家闹通宵，搞得人没法休息。我只好登门讲理。他倒乖，道了歉，也很少再闹了。后听邻居说，法国有规定，晚１０时后，家庭娱乐不得影响他人；打个电话，警察就来制止。用不着邻居之间闹不愉快。
    上述几件琐事不知能否印证这个道理：治理现代社会这个人类群体要靠法制，公德也只有在法制的基础上才能得以发扬；有了法规，民众就有了自行排解纠纷的准绳，朝着本来意义上的民主迈进：民众作主治理。离开法制而空喊公德，或者呼唤什么清官廉吏、政治强人，就会堕入唯心主义，不是天真，就是欺骗。
