	Some factory directors are calling for an end to the trend of "buying entrepreneurs with money."

	According to Xinhua News Agency from Harbin on May 26th, "As long as you pay a few thousand yuan, you can become an 'entrepreneur,'" this is the impression left by the numerous entrepreneur dictionaries, albums, and books published recently. During interviews, reporters found that more and more factory directors are very displeased with this trend, viewing it as a heavy burden, and calling for relevant departments to quickly stop this practice.

	The director of a large factory in Harbin with ten thousand employees is already a well-known entrepreneur nationwide. This year, he has received a thick stack of letters requesting to include him in entrepreneur dictionaries, albums, and books. These letters demand that the factory pay several thousand or even tens of thousands of yuan in fees. The director smiled bitterly to the reporter, "If the factory were to meet all these demands, it would need to pay a total of one million yuan. Where would the factory get this kind of money? Even if we could afford it, spending money to promote an individual director would have a bad influence on the public."

	When a certain television station launched a special program to promote entrepreneurs, they immediately demanded that a factory pay one or two hundred thousand yuan. Directors have told reporters that such demands are extremely unreasonable. If they refuse, they offend people; if they agree, the factory cannot afford it.

	They appeal that the state should set a standard for entrepreneurs. The publication of entrepreneur dictionaries, albums, and books should be strictly controlled and not allowed to be published indiscriminately. Those who use this opportunity to exploit enterprises should be firmly stopped.

　　一些厂长呼吁
    刹住“花钱买企业家”歪风
    据新华社哈尔滨五月二十六日电  （记者顾万明）“只要拿出几千元，就可以当个‘企业家’”，这是当前纷纷出版的一些企业家辞典、画册、书籍给人们留下的印象。记者在采访中发现，愈来愈多的厂长对这股歪风十分反感，视为沉重的负担，呼吁有关部门尽快刹住此风。
    哈尔滨一家万人大厂的厂长早已是全国闻名的企业家，今年以来，他收到要求把他编入企业家辞典、画册、书籍的信函有一厚迭，这些信函要求工厂支付几千元或上万元的费用。这位厂长苦笑着对记者说：“如果工厂都要满足他们的这些要求，总共要支付一百万元，工厂哪里来这笔费用？就是拿得起，花钱宣传厂长个人，群众影响也太坏。”
    某家电视台开辟企业家宣传专题节目时，开口就要一个工厂出一、二万元。厂长们向记者反映，这类事十分强人所难，不答应吧得罪人，答应下来工厂又拿不出这么多钱。
    他们呼吁，国家应当为企业家立个标准。对企业家辞典、画册、书籍的出版要严格控制，不可滥出，对借此刮企业油水的，要予以坚决制止。
