Today afternoon, in the ten individual events of the 1989 China Cup (Samsung) International Gymnastics Competition, the host team easily won eight championships. The pommel horse and still rings titles were taken by East German athlete Tippelt.

This event, although listed as one of the eight traditional high-level international invitational competitions in the world today, due to financial constraints, did not offer prize money and thus failed to attract top-tier athletes. The 19-year-old Chinese athlete Li Jing won the championships in men's all-around, vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar. The first place in men's floor exercise was taken by another Chinese athlete, Zhang Wei. The four women's individual events were won by Chinese athletes Yang Bo and Fan Di. Prior to this, the 15-year-old Yang Bo also won the women's all-around championship.

    中国杯国际体操赛落幕
    本报北京４月３０日讯  记者缪鲁报道：今天下午，在１９８９年中国杯（三星）国际体操赛十个单项角逐中，东道主轻松地夺走八项冠军。鞍马和吊环奖杯为民主德国名将梯佩尔特所获。
    这次赛事虽被列入当今世界八个传统高水平国际邀请赛之一，但由于经费所限，未设奖金，没能招来世界一流选手。１９岁的中国选手李敬夺得男子个人全能、跳马、单杠、双杠的冠军。男子自由体操的第一名为另一名中国选手张伟所获。四个女子单项的冠军被中国选手杨波和樊迪平分。在此之前，１５岁的杨波还夺得女子个人全能冠军。
