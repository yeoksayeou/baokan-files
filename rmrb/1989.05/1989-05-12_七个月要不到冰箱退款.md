Last June 14, I purchased a double-door refrigerator from the Yanjiao Daily Goods Store in Wuxi County. The refrigerator was made by the Hangzhou General Electric Factory and was a Nichi brand, priced at 1,815 yuan. At the time, the store also provided a ceiling fan and a table fan as part of the deal.

Last August, when I opened the refrigerator to use it, I found that there were problems. On August 23 and 26, I went to the store twice to demand a refund, but the store told me to return the refrigerator directly to the Wuxi County Daily Goods Company. On August 27 and 28, I negotiated with the county company for two consecutive days, and they also agreed to accept the return. On August 30 in the morning, I delivered the refrigerator to the county company, but they did not give me the refund at that time, only a receipt for the return.

To get the refund, I made dozens of phone calls and visited the county company countless times, but the response was always: "Be patient and wait." On March 9 this year, I went to the county company again, and the responses from the director and deputy director were the same as before.

　　七个月要不到冰箱退款
    去年６月１４日，我在无锡县堰桥日用杂品商店，买了一台杭州通用电器厂生产的日芝牌双门电冰箱，价格是１８１５元。当时这家商店还搭配销售了一台吊扇和一台台扇。
    去年８月，我打开冰箱使用时，发现有问题。８月２３日和２６日，我两次到商店要求退货，商店叫我直接把冰箱退给无锡县日用杂品公司。２７日和２８日，我又连续两天与县日杂公司交涉，他们也同意退货。８月３０日上午，我把冰箱运到县日杂公司，但是他们当时没有给我退货款，只给我一张退货条。
    为索要退货款，我打了几十次电话，到县日杂公司跑了无数趟，但得到的回答是：“耐心等待。”今年３月９日，我再次前往县日杂公司，正副经理的答复仍然如故。
