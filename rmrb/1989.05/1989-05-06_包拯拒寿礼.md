A few days before Bao Zheng's 60th birthday, his son Bao Gui, following his father's instructions, refused gifts at the courthouse entrance. The first person to send a gift was the emperor himself. The messenger was a eunuch from the imperial palace. This put Bao Gui in a difficult position: how could he refuse a gift from the emperor? He had no choice but to ask the old eunuch to write down the reason for sending the gift on a red paper and present it to his father. The old eunuch wrote a poem on the red paper:

"Your virtue is high, your reputation is great, a minister of the first rank.
Day and night you work like Wei Zheng.
Today the emperor sends you a gift,
Refusing it at the gate is unreasonable."

Bao Gui had Wang Chao take the poem to the inner court to show his father. Soon, Wang Chao returned with the original red paper and handed it to the eunuch. On the poem, his father had added four lines:

"With an iron face and a loyal heart,
As an official, fearing the mention of merits most.
Working hard is part of an official's duty,
Refusing gifts sets a trend of integrity."

The eunuch from the imperial palace had no choice but to take the gift and the red paper back to the palace to report.

　　包拯拒寿礼
    包拯六十寿辰前几天，儿子包贵遵父命在衙门口拒礼。谁知送寿礼的第一家就是当朝天子。来人是六宫司礼太监。这下可难住了包贵，万岁爷送来的礼敢不收吗？只好请老太监将送礼的理由写在一张红纸上转呈父亲。老太监提笔在红纸上写了一首诗：“德高望重一品卿。日夜操劳似魏征。今日皇上把礼送，拒礼门外理不通。”
    包贵让王朝把诗拿到内衙呈父亲展视。不一会，王朝带回原红纸交付太监，只见原诗下边添了四句：“铁面无私丹心忠，坐官最怕叨念功。操劳为官份内事，拒礼为开廉洁风。”
    六宫司礼太监只好带着礼物和那张红纸回宫交差。
