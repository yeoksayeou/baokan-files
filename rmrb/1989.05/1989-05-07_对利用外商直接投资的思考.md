China has utilized foreign direct investment for a decade, achieving notable successes while also encountering various problems. It is imperative to timely and seriously summarize these experiences. This article aims to use the fluctuations in China's domestic economic cycle as a thread and the transformation of the system as a backdrop to reflect on China's decade of utilizing foreign direct investment. Such reflections aim to avoid attributing the growth and fluctuations of foreign direct investment entirely to policy gains and losses, helping to distinguish between two different types of constraints on utilizing foreign direct investment: the constraints of the existing system and the constraints of the objective level of productive forces.

I. Growth and Fluctuations

A comprehensive analysis of China's major economic indicators proves that China's economic growth objectively exhibits cyclical fluctuations, i.e., the alternating cycles of economic expansion and contraction. This economic cycle is largely driven by fluctuations in investment. Statistical analysis shows a significant positive correlation between the growth of fixed asset investment and economic growth.

China's utilization of foreign direct investment, after the exploratory preparation phase from 1979 to 1982, has entered a phase of scaled development. From 1979 to 1987, China's foreign direct investment agreements amounted to $22.8 billion, with an actual utilization of $8.9 billion. During this period, the inflow of foreign direct capital was influenced not only by the international direct capital flow pattern and China's policies to attract foreign investment but also by domestic economic and investment fluctuations. Statistical data indicate a high positive correlation between the growth rates of foreign direct investment agreements, total social output value, and fixed asset investment during the same period. This is because, during China's economic cycles, the industrial and construction sectors exhibit the largest fluctuations and the highest investment growth rates, with rapid expansion in processing industries, thereby inducing foreign direct investment to flow into these sectors and resonate with their fluctuations. This is evident in two ways: first, the inflow of international direct capital is constrained by investment cycle fluctuations; second, the operation of existing foreign-invested enterprises also faces supply shortages and resource "bottlenecks" during the economic contraction phase of the fluctuation cycle.

II. Contradictions and Dilemmas

After a decade of reform, China is in a transitional period where the old and new systems coexist. This specific system is not only one of the causes of the aforementioned economic cycle fluctuations but also directly constrains the inflow of international capital into China. Subjectively, we hope that foreign-invested enterprises will operate according to international norms, but objectively, foreign-invested enterprises can only adapt and develop within the existing system.

China's investment environment faces various problems. These include hard environment issues such as low transportation and communication capabilities, as well as shortages of energy and materials, all constrained by the level of productive forces. There are also soft environment issues such as an underdeveloped legal system and low administrative efficiency. Compared to some developing countries, China's hard investment environment is not significantly different, and issues such as an underdeveloped legal system and low administrative efficiency have seen significant improvements due to the central government's attention and collective efforts. However, more challenging to resolve is the lack of a necessary market system under the current system, including unified markets for production materials, capital, and labor services. Due to the absence of a unified market for production materials, foreign-invested enterprises cannot purchase production materials at market prices, leading to situations where needed raw materials are often unavailable. Due to the lack of a true financial market, the current system mainly allocates fiscal and banking funds through planned quotas, with limited funds available for foreign investment matching, resulting in a long-term shortage of matching funds for foreign investment. Due to the absence of a labor market, foreign-invested enterprises often face difficulties in recruiting needed talent and managing redundant personnel.

The distribution of China's foreign direct investment is roughly as follows: hotels and services account for 43%, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries account for 2%, energy (mainly offshore oil exploration and development) accounts for 34%, raw materials account for 4%, and other industrial sectors account for 17%. The investment is clearly skewed towards hotels and services and light processing industries, which has little optimizing effect on China's existing irrational industrial structure. The direct cause of this foreign investment distribution pattern is the difference between the strategic goals of international capital investment and China's foreign investment attraction strategy. The deeper reason is related to China's current dual system of old and new: on one hand, the price system in the old system has long been irrational compared to the international market price system, with prices for raw materials, energy, transportation, and other basic industries being too low, and prices for finished products being too high, naturally leading to a tilt in foreign investment; on the other hand, after decentralizing power and benefits to expand enterprise autonomy, the motivation for enterprises to seek profits has been strengthened, but the soft budget constraint status has not fundamentally changed. Thus, investment "hunger" combined with price distortion inevitably leads to irrational foreign investment. The above situation indicates that in guiding foreign investment, the true market mechanism plays a limited role.

The most serious problem in the operation and management of China's foreign-invested enterprises is administrative interference from supervisory departments, which involves the economic interests, personnel arrangements, and development plans of enterprises. Strictly speaking, this is not an issue of enterprise management but a problem of the relationship between the government and enterprises. In the old system, enterprises have long been subordinate to government administrative departments, with unclear enterprise property rights, and national interests representing enterprise interests. This fixed idea from the old system makes government officials regard the internal management of enterprises as their responsibility, often treating foreign-invested enterprises equally. In the macro-management of foreign direct investment, due to administrative decentralization, there was once a phenomenon of multiple authorities and mismanagement, particularly in taxation, where local governments competed to offer preferential tax rates, while national unified industry preferences were not prominent.

III. Prospects and Solutions

Internationally, the overall pattern of international direct capital flow is that 3/4 of international direct capital flows into developed countries, with the remaining mostly flowing into high-income developing countries. At the same time, competition for foreign investment among general developing countries is fierce, and China particularly faces competition from ASEAN countries. Domestically, controlling total social demand, compressing the scale of fixed asset investment, improving the economic environment, and rectifying economic order are China's main tasks for the next two years. Therefore, due to the constraints of the domestic and international environments, the development speed of China's utilization of foreign direct investment will not be fast in the coming period. Under these circumstances, we should strive to improve the efficiency of foreign investment and optimize the direction of foreign investment.

Currently, foreign direct investment is shifting towards productive industries, but it will not shift to bottleneck industries in the short term. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to comprehensively consider the direction of both domestic and foreign investment, appropriately compressing domestic investment in industries with high foreign investment to better introduce advanced foreign technology and management experience.

The drawbacks of the current system and the overheated economic environment have a significant impact on foreign-invested enterprises. Particularly, high inflation rates and significant increases in the prices of production materials have raised the production costs of existing foreign-invested enterprises, reducing their international competitiveness. This also increases the difficulty of feasibility studies for potential investments in China. Therefore, while rectifying economic order, improving the economic environment, and curbing inflation, specific policy measures need to be taken.

To address the shortage of matching funds, some suggest including the funds needed by foreign-invested enterprises in the planned allocation, but China's planned funds are limited and have specific uses, making it difficult to allocate a portion for this purpose. Moreover, from a long-term perspective, this approach seems inconsistent with the reform goal of forming a market mechanism. It appears that the focus should be on improving the environment and encouraging more wholly foreign-owned enterprises. Wholly foreign-owned enterprises have clear property rights, which are a powerful exogenous factor in forming a reasonable relationship between the government and enterprises and in forming a competitive market. From this perspective, utilizing foreign direct investment not only introduces advanced technology and management experience but also serves as an effective driving force for forming a market mechanism and deepening reform.

　　对利用外商直接投资的思考
    聂海鹰
    我国利用外商直接投资十年，成绩显著，问题也不少，应及时认真总结。本文拟以国内经济周期波动为线索，以体制转换为背景，对我国十年利用外商直接投资进行某些反思。这样反思，是为了避免把利用外商直接投资的增长与波动完全归结为政策的得失，有助于区分利用外商直接投资的两种不同性质的制约因素，即现存体制的制约和客观生产力水平的制约。
    　　　　一、增长与波动
    对我国主要经济指标的综合分析证明，我国经济增长客观上存在着周期性波动，即经济扩张和经济收缩的交替循环，而这种经济周期波动很大程度上是由投资周期波动引起的。根据统计分析，固定资产投资增长与经济增长之间具有显著的正相关关系。
    我国利用外商直接投资，经过１９７９—１９８２年的摸索准备阶段，已进入了规模发展阶段。１９７９—１９８７年，我国利用外商直接投资协议金额为２２８亿美元，实际使用金额为８９亿美元。这一时期外商直接资本的投入，除了受国际直接资本流动格局的影响和我国吸收外资政策的刺激外，也受到国内经济波动和投资波动的制约。统计资料表明，同期的外商直接投资协议金额增长率、社会总产值增长率和固定资产投资增长率之间呈现极大的正相关性。这是因为我国经济周期波动中，工业和建筑业的波动幅度最大，投资增长率最高，加工工业扩张迅猛，从而诱导外商直接投资流向这些领域并与之共振荡。这表现在一方面国际直接资本的流入受到投资周期波动的制约，另一方面现有外商投资企业的运行，也面临波动周期中经济收缩阶段的供给不足和资源“瓶颈”的影响。
    　　　　二、矛盾与困境
    我国历经十年改革，正处在新旧体制并存的过渡时期。这一时期的特定体制既是上述经济周期波动的成因之一，也直接制约着国际资本向中国的流入。我们主观上虽然希望外商投资企业按国际惯例经营，但是客观上外商投资企业只能在现有体制中变通发展。
    我国投资环境存在着各种问题。其中既有受生产力水平制约的运输、通讯能力低和能源、材料短缺等硬环境问题，又有法制不健全、行政办事效率低等软环境问题。如果与某些发展中国家比较，我国投资硬环境并非相差甚远，法制不健全、行政办事效率低等问题，经过中央重视与各方努力，也有较大改善。相比之下，更不易解决的是现行体制下没有形成必要的市场体系，缺乏统一的生产资料、资金和劳务市场。由于没有统一的生产资料市场，外商投资企业又不能购买平价生产资料，因此所需原材料往往有价无货；由于没有真正意义上的金融市场，现行体制下财政银行资金又主要实行计划分配额度，用于外资的配套资金十分有限，致使外商投资的配套资金长期不足；由于没有劳动力市场，外商投资企业所需人才和闲置人员往往处于进出两难的境地。
    我国外商直接投资的投向分布大致是，饭店服务业占４３％，农牧渔业占２％，能源（主要是海上石油勘探开发）占３４％，原材料占４％，其它工业行业占１７％。资金投向明显偏于饭店服务业和轻加工工业，这对我国现有不合理的产业结构难以起到优化作用。形成这种外资投向格局的直接原因，是国际资本投资的战略目标与我国吸收外资战略目标的差异，而深层原因则与我国现行的新旧双重体制有关：一方面是旧体制中我国的价格体系与国际市场价格体系相比长期不合理，即原材料、能源、交通运输等基础产业的价格偏低，制成品价格偏高，这种不合理的价格体系自然会导致外资投向的倾斜；另一方面是放权让利扩大企业自主权后，加强了企业谋求利润的动机，而企业预算约束软化状态并未根本改变。于是，投资“饥饿”加价格扭曲，势必导致外资投向不合理。上述情况说明，在引导外资投向上，真正意义的市场机制的作用并不大。
    我国外商投资企业经营管理中最严重的问题是主管部门的行政干预，它涉及企业的经济利益、人事安排和发展规划等，严格说这并不是企业自身的经营管理问题，而是政府与企业的关系问题。我国旧体制下的企业长期附属于政府行政部门，企业产权没有明确界定，国家的利益就代表企业的利益。这种旧体制下形成的固有观念，使政府行政官员把企业的内部经营管理也视为己任，尽管是外商投资企业也往往同等对待。而在对外商直接投资的宏观管理上，由于行政性的简政放权，却一度出现政出多门、管理失当的现象，尤其是在税收上，各地竞相攀比优惠税率，而国家统一的行业优惠却不突出。
    　　　　三、前景与出路
    从国际看，国际直接资本流向的总格局是，３／４的国际直接资本流入发达国家，其余的大部分流入高收入的发展中国家，同时，一般发展中国家吸引外资竞争激烈，我国尤其面临东盟国家的竞争。从国内看，控制社会总需求，压缩固定资产投资规模，治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，是我国今明两年的主要任务。因此，受国内外客观环境限制，今后一个时期我国利用外商直接投资的发展速度不会很快。在这种情况下，我们应该努力提高外资效益，优化外资投向。
    目前外商直接投资的投向虽已转向生产性行业，但短期内还不会转向瓶颈产业部门。在这种情况下，我们有必要综合考虑内外资的投向，在外资投入较多的加工工业部门适当压缩内资的投入，以便能够更好地引进外国的先进技术和管理经验。
    现行体制的弊端和经济过热的环境对外商投资企业影响很大。尤其是高通货膨胀率和生产资料价格大幅度上涨，使现有外商投资企业生产成本提高，国际市场的竞争能力下降。这也增加了酝酿中的来华投资的可行性研究的难度。因此，在整顿经济秩序，治理经济环境，抑制通货膨胀的同时，还需要具体采取一些政策措施。
    为解决配套资金短缺问题，有同志主张把外商投资企业所需资金划入计划内，但我国计划内资金数额有限，用途明确，很难再分割出一块。另外，从长远看这种办法也似乎与形成市场机制的改革目标不相吻合。看来，重点只能放在整治环境和鼓励多办独资企业上。独资企业产权明确，对形成政府与企业的合理关系和形成竞争性市场都是一个有力的外生因素。从这个角度看，利用外商直接投资，不仅能够引进先进技术和管理经验，而且对形成市场机制、促进改革深化还是一个有效动因。
