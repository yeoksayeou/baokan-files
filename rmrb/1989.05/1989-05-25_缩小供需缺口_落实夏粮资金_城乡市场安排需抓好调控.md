From the Ministry of Commerce, it is reported that from January to April this year, except for a few regions where some commodities experienced a brief period of panic buying, the urban and rural markets across the country have generally remained stable. However, analyzing the market environment, the next few months will still face a relatively severe situation for urban and rural market arrangements.

From the situation in the first four months, various regions have established systems for ensuring the supply of essential commodities and monitoring key commodities. Some regions have allocated special reserve funds to stockpile essential commodities, ensuring a continuous supply. The supply of major staple foods has been relatively abundant, with stable prices.

The current problem is that the procurement volume of major commodities has decreased, with significant reductions in commodities such as yellow and red hemp, tea leaves, cowhide, bamboo, cigarettes, cotton cloth, synthetic fabrics, wool, silk, and sewing machines. Commercial inventories are weak, and the supply-demand gap is widening. Especially due to a shortage of funds, the procurement of some agricultural and industrial products will be seriously affected, directly impacting the supply of goods during the peak season in the coming months. It is understood that the funds for the procurement of pigs, vegetables, sugar crops, and the upcoming summer grain and oil crops have not been fully secured.

To effectively arrange the urban and rural markets for the second half of the year, the Ministry of Commerce emphasizes the need to focus on regions with high purchasing power and potential volatility, such as coastal areas, while also arranging support for inland, remote, mountainous, and impoverished regions. The Ministry of Commerce also proposes specific measures to reasonably adjust market supply and demand:

	•	Efforts must be made to ensure the procurement of agricultural and industrial products. The key is to solve the problem of procurement funds. Commercial enterprises should explore all possible means to organize and secure procurement funds, and prepare for the procurement of summer grain and oil. Special attention should be given to the preparation, advance allocation, and fulfillment of goods linked to the procurement of agricultural products, aiming to procure more grain and oil.

	•	Ensure the supply of staple foods in cities and the distribution of industrial products to rural areas. The stability of urban markets largely depends on the arrangement of "rice bags" and "vegetable baskets." Efforts should be made to arrange and allocate urban rations. Further development of staple food production bases and the south-to-north vegetable distribution system in major cities is necessary. Additionally, new resources and forms for the distribution of industrial products to rural areas should be explored.

	•	Strengthen market regulation capabilities and establish and improve the central and provincial market regulation systems. Focus on the planned management of commodities, and comprehensively use economic, legal, and administrative measures to regulate and stabilize the market.

	•	Continue to improve the order of circulation. The focus should be on the regulation of wholesale markets. In principle, the wholesale of important agricultural and industrial products related to the national economy and people's livelihood should be mainly handled by state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives.

### 缩小供需缺口　落实夏粮资金  城乡市场安排需抓好调控

　　缩小供需缺口　落实夏粮资金
    城乡市场安排需抓好调控
    本报北京５月２５日讯  来自商业部的消息说：今年１至４月，除个别地区的部分商品一度发生抢购现象外，全国城乡市场基本趋于平稳。但从市场环境分析，今后几个月城乡市场的安排依然面临较严峻的趋势。
    从前４个月的情况看，各地普遍建立了必保商品制度和监控商品制度。有些地区拨出专项储备资金，储备市场上必需商品，基本保证了供应不断档。各地主要副食品货源比较充裕，供应情况好，价格也较平稳。
    目前存在的问题是，主要商品收购量下降，其中，黄红麻、茶叶、牛皮、毛竹、卷烟、棉布、化纤布、呢绒、绸缎、缝纫机等农副产品和工业品下降较多。商业库存薄弱，商品供需缺口扩大。特别是因资金紧缺将严重影响部分农副产品和工业品的收购，直接影响后几个月旺季市场的货源。据了解，当前收购生猪、蔬菜、糖料和即将收购的夏季粮油等的资金没完全落实。
    为切实安排好下半年城乡市场，商业部强调既要抓好购买力较大、易发生波动的沿海地区的市场安排，又要安排好内地边远山区、贫困地区的扶贫救灾。商业部还提出合理调节市场供求的具体措施：
    ——千方百计抓好农副业产品和工业品收购，关键要解决好收购资金问题。商业企业要千方百计挖掘潜力，组织和落实收购资金，做好夏季粮油收购的各项准备工作，特别是做好收购农副产品挂钩物资的货源准备、预拨和兑现，力争多收购一些粮油。
    ——抓好城市副食品供应和农村工业品下乡。城市市场的稳定，主要是安排好“米袋子”和“菜篮子”。要做好城市口粮的安排和调剂工作。进一步抓好大城市的副食品基地建设和南菜北调工作。还要想方设法开发工业品下乡的新资源和新形式。
    ——加强市场调控能力，建立和完善中央和省市两级市场调控体系。重点抓好商品的计划管理，综合运用经济、法律、行政等多种手段，以调控和稳定市场。
    ——继续搞好流通秩序的整顿。重点要搞好批发整顿，凡关系国计民生的重要农副产品和日用工业品批发，原则上以国营商业和供销社为主经营。
