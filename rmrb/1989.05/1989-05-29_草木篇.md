The narcissus curls up, daring not to face the north wind's slaughter of autumn flowers. Afterward, it cautiously pokes its head out to observe if the world has changed. In the distance, the rumble of thunder can be faintly heard. News from the south brings word that spring has begun its northern expedition. Only then do you reveal the lies wrapped up, turning them into a golden fairy tale.

The peony is tired of the years adorned with swords and spears, tired of the tyranny and arrogance of the conqueror. You say the military tent is an upside-down wine cup, but the general would not straighten his life until the sad parting at Gaixia. Only then did he drink the blood as wine, finishing his regrets. You cannot bear to drink it, and for two thousand years, ignorant bees have been making sweet stories.

The ginkgo stands as a specimen of time, waiting for a thousand years of expectation. Circle after circle, the tree rings tightly coil the inner monologue. Whether it is hatred or love, it wields small fans, saying the wind is cool and refreshing. Butterflies come to entangle, bees come to gather, and it reports with a white eye to this colorful world.

    草木篇
    叶庆瑞
        水仙花将身子缩成一团不敢直面北风对秋花的屠杀事后，小心翼翼探出头来窥视世界有无变化远方，隐隐可闻惊雷的轰炸有消息自南方传来春天开始了北伐这时，你才把包裹的谎言吐露成一篇金色的童话
        虞美人花厌倦了刀枪装饰的岁月厌倦了霸王的杀戮和骄横你说军帐是一只倒扣的酒盅可将军终不愿将生活端正直至垓下凄凉的一别他才以血当酒，饮尽遗恨你不忍喝，那血酒举了两千年一任无知蜜蜂去酿制甜的故事
        银杏站成时间之标本守候一千年的期待一圈又一圈年轮紧卷起内心的独白不知是恨  不知是爱摇一柄柄小扇，却道风好凉快有蝶来缠，有蜂来采报以白眼，给这花花绿绿世界
    注：银杏之果，白色，如眼状。
