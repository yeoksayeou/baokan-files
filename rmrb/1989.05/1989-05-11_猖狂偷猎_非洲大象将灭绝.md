Xinhua News Agency, Nairobi, May 9th.

Rampant poaching of wild elephants in Kenya continues unabated, with at least 60 elephants killed in various national parks across the country in the first four months of this year.

According to Kenyan newspapers, among the elephants killed were young ones weighing as little as 1.5 kilograms. The tusks of adult elephants were taken, while the young ones were left as worthless victims.

Last year, more than 100 elephants were killed in Kenya. During the height of the poaching, President Moi ordered that poachers be "executed on the spot," but the killing of wild elephants has only increased.

Reports indicate that Kenya, once known as the "land of elephants," now has only 20,000 wild elephants left nationwide.

Recently, Ugandan authorities revealed that the number of wild elephants in Uganda has decreased from 20,000 to less than 2,000.

In Tanzania, the number of elephants nationwide has dropped to less than 80,000.

In Zambia, Mozambique, and Angola, the number of wild elephants is decreasing at an annual rate of 8.1%. It is said that anti-government forces in Angola have killed 100,000 elephants in the past four years to fund their war efforts.

Last century, the entire African continent had an estimated 10 million wild elephants. Now, only 400,000 remain. Experts estimate that if this trend continues, African elephant herds will be extinct within the next 10 years.

　　猖狂偷猎　非洲大象将灭绝
    新华社内罗毕５月９日电  肯尼亚偷猎野象的事件屡禁不止，今年头４个月，又有至少６０头象在全国各地的自然保护区被猎杀。
    据肯尼亚报纸报道，被杀死的象中有的幼象体重仅１．５公斤。成年象的牙被取走，而幼象成了毫无价值的牺牲品。
    去年，肯尼亚有１００多头象被打死。在偷猎猖獗时期，莫伊总统曾下令对偷猎者“就地正法”，但猎杀野象仍有增无减。
    据报道，昔日号称“象海”的肯尼亚，如今全国仅剩下２００００头野象。
    乌干达有关方面最近透露，乌干达的野象数目已从过去的２００００头减少到目前的不足２０００头。
    坦桑尼亚全国有大象已不足８万头。
    在赞比亚、莫桑比克和安哥拉，野象的数目以年均８．１％的速度递减。据说，安反政府武装在过去的４年中猎杀了大象１０万头以支付战争费用。
    上个世纪，整个非洲估计有大约１０００万头野象，而现在幸存的野象仅有４０万头。专家们估计，如此下去，再过１０年非洲的野象群将不复存在。
