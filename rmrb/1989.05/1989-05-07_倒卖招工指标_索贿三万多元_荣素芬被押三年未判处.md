*Gōngrén Rìbào* reporter Fēng Bǎocēng and *Rénmín Rìbào* reporter Ào Tēng report:

The former chairman of the trade union of the Inner Mongolia Hydrological and Engineering Geological Exploration Team, Róng Sùfēn, sold 37 job quotas from 1983 to 1985 and extorted a total of 33,650 yuan. After the case was exposed, she was arrested and detained for three years, but has not yet been sentenced.

The job quotas that Róng Sùfēn sold were all obtained from the Labor Bureau of Hohhot City. She sold these quotas to families of unemployed youth, charging 1,500 yuan for each full-time quota and 500 yuan for each collective quota. In 1984, Róng Sùfēn sold a full-time quota to a teacher from a certain middle school in Hohhot, Wang XX, and extorted 1,500 yuan in cash.

Róng Sùfēn's activities were exposed in 1985, but she has not been sentenced yet. Many people are puzzled and ask: How did a grassroots trade union chairman have such power?

　　倒卖招工指标　索贿三万多元    
    荣素芬被押三年未判处
    本报呼和浩特５月７日讯  《工人日报》记者封宝诚、本报记者傲腾报道：原内蒙古水文地质勘探队工会主席荣素芬从１９８３年至１９８５年两年间共倒卖招工指标３７个，共索贿３３６５０元。案发后被逮捕关押，已有３年之久，至今未作判处。
    荣素芬倒卖的招工指标都是从呼和浩特市劳动局搞到的。她将得到的劳动指标卖给有待业青年的工人家庭，每个全民指标索取１５００元，每个集体指标索取５００元。荣素芬１９８４年卖给呼市××中学教员王××一个全民指标，索取现金１５００元。
    荣素芬的活动是１９８５年暴露的，至今未作判处，很多群众不解地问：一个基层的工会主席怎么有这么大的能耐？
