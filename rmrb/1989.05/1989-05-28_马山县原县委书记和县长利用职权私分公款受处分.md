Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 28th.

The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region's Discipline Inspection Commission recently issued a notice stating that the former secretary of the Masong County Committee, Ho Wei-liang, and the former deputy secretary and mayor of the county, Chen Yi-qiang, used their positions to embezzle 200,000 yuan in public funds and have received party and administrative disciplinary actions. Ho Wei-liang was given a two-year probationary period within the party and had his salary reduced by two levels; Chen Yi-qiang was given a two-year probationary period within the party, and it is recommended that his administrative position be revoked, with his salary reduced by two levels. Other participants also received punishments.

At the end of 1984, the tax department of Masong County was responsible for collecting the industrial and commercial tax on electricity from the Dahua Power Plant, which exceeded the quota. According to regulations, Masong County should have refunded 330,000 yuan to the Dahua Power Plant. The acting director of the Dahua Power Plant, Wang Qi-quan, the party secretary, Yang Chang-yu, and Chen Yi-qiang agreed to take 50,000 yuan from the 330,000 yuan, with 30,000 yuan to be retained by the Masong County Finance Bureau, and the remaining 20,000 yuan to be privately divided among the main leaders of Masong County and the Dahua Power Plant. Ho Wei-liang agreed to this. Ho Wei-liang received 4,000 yuan, and Chen Yi-qiang received 4,800 yuan.

In July 1985, Masong County began its rectification campaign. To cover up the error of embezzling 200,000 yuan in public funds, Ho Wei-liang, Chen Yi-qiang, and others wrote a false report in the name of the county Economic Commission, stating that Masong County had borrowed money from the Dahua Power Plant. As some officials and the masses exposed this to higher authorities, Ho Wei-liang and Chen Yi-qiang felt increasing pressure and repaid the funds in February of the following year. The Autonomous Region's Discipline Inspection Commission therefore decided to handle the case lightly.

　　马山县原县委书记和县长
    利用职权私分公款受处分
    新华社南宁５月２８日电  广西壮族自治区纪委新近发出通报，马山县原县委书记霍维良，原县委副书记、县长陈义强利用职权私分公款２万元，受到党纪政纪处分：霍维良留党察看两年，降两级工资；陈义强留党察看两年，建议撤销行政职务，工资降两级。其他参与者也都受到了处分。
    １９８４年底，由马山县税务部门负责征收大化电厂电力工商税超额完成，按规定，马山县应返还大化电厂３３万元。大化电厂代厂长王其全、厂党委书记杨长宇和陈义强商定，从３３万元中拿出５万元，其中３万元留给马山县财政局，其余２万元由马山县和大化电厂主要领导干部私分，霍维良表示同意。霍维良分得４０００元，陈义强分得４８００元。
    １９８５年７月，马山县开始整党，霍维良、陈义强等人为掩盖私分２万元公款的错误，用县经委名义写了马山县向大化电厂借款的假报告。在一些干部、群众向上级揭发后，霍维良、陈义强等人感到压力越来越大，于次年２月退款。自治区纪委因此决定从轻处理。
