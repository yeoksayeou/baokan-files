The steel industry, which experienced a severe slump in the first quarter, has shown signs of improvement in the second quarter. With the support of relevant departments, the steel industry has not only gradually resumed normal production but also achieved a historical best in average daily steel production in April, reaching 17.04 million tons.

According to statistics from the Ministry of Metallurgy, by May 10, the national steel production had accumulated to 20.68 million tons, approaching the required pace of the annual plan; the production of iron and steel products reached 19.41 million tons and 16.45 million tons respectively, completing about 35% of the annual plan's production.

Since the beginning of this year, the metallurgical industry has faced serious production difficulties, mainly due to the severe shortage of necessary coking coal and electricity. From January to April, the contract execution rate for coking coal supply was low. The inventory of coking coal in key steel enterprises was reduced by more than half compared to normal levels, with some large steel companies having only enough coking coal for one or two days. The electricity supply was even more tense, with key ferroalloy plants facing severe power shortages. Under these difficult conditions, the more than 3 million workers in the metallurgical system united and worked hard, not only focusing on increasing the production of steel, iron, and steel products but also paying attention to the development of short-line steel product varieties urgently needed by the national economy. From January to April, the production of thin plates, strip steel, seamless steel pipes, light rails, and other short-line products increased significantly compared to the same period last year.

A responsible person from the Ministry of Metallurgy believes that although the steel production situation has improved in the second quarter, the shortage of energy and raw materials has not significantly improved. Especially, the situation for key steel enterprises remains quite difficult. The steel production in the first four months of these key enterprises still has a significant gap compared to the same period last year. The risk of steel production falling again still exists. To fully complete this year's steel production plan, a great effort is still needed from all parties.

　　扭转滑坡局面　生产趋于正常    
    钢铁工业二季度出现转机     
    四月份创平均日产钢历史最好成绩
    新华社北京５月１８日电（记者顾洪洪）一季度严重滑坡的钢铁生产进入二季度以来出现新的转机。在有关部门大力支持下，钢铁工业不仅逐步恢复了正常生产，４月份还创造出平均日产钢１７．０４万吨的历史最好成绩。
    据冶金部统计，到５月１０日为止，全国产钢已累计２０６８万吨，接近年计划要求的进度；铁和钢材产量也分别达到１９４１万吨和１６４５万吨，完成了年计划产量的３５％左右。
    今年以来，冶金工业在生产中遇到了严重困难，主要是生产所必需的洗精煤和电的供应严重不足。１至４月份，洗精煤供货合同执行率较低，重点钢铁企业洗精煤库存比正常库存下降了一半还多，有的大型钢铁公司洗精煤库存只够一两天之用。电的供应更为紧张，重点铁合金厂供电严重不足。在这种困难的情况下，冶金系统３００多万职工团结一致、艰苦奋斗，不仅重视增加钢、铁、钢材等的产量，而且注意发展国民经济急需的短线钢材品种。１至４月份，薄板、带钢、无缝钢管、轻轨等短线产品的产量，分别比去年同期有了较大的增长。
    冶金部负责人认为，二季度以来，钢铁生产形势虽然有所好转，但能源、原材料紧缺的局面并没有明显改善。特别是重点钢铁企业处境仍比较艰难。头４个月重点钢铁企业钢产量和去年同期相比还有较大差距。钢产量再次下降的危险依然存在。要全面完成今年的钢铁生产计划，仍需各方面做出巨大努力。
