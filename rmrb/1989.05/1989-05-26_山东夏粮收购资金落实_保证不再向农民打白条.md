Shandong, a major wheat-producing region in China, is expecting a bumper harvest of over 60 million mu of summer grain. The provincial Party Committee and government have emphasized in their arrangements for summer grain procurement that the procurement policies must be strictly implemented to ensure that farmers can sell their grain with confidence.

This year, due to the state's reduction in credit scale, various funds are quite tight. In response, Shandong Province has ensured the over 2.8 billion yuan needed for grain and oil procurement, making every effort to guarantee that cash is paid out immediately upon procurement, and no IOUs will be issued.

For farmers who have completed their contracted wheat procurement, the provincial government has stipulated that subsidized fertilizers and diesel, which are linked to the procurement, must be fully delivered to the households. No unit or individual is allowed to withhold or deduct these items. The practice of supplying linked fertilizers and diesel through ticket-based, designated points will continue. The grain departments must adhere to the principle of issuing tickets upon grain procurement, while the supply and marketing cooperatives must timely reserve the supply of fertilizers and diesel to ensure that farmers can purchase the linked materials at any time with their tickets.

　　山东夏粮收购资金落实
    保证不再向农民打白条
    本报济南电  记者贾建舟、宋学春报道：我国小麦主要产区——山东省的６０００多万亩夏粮丰收在望。省委、省政府在部署夏粮收购工作时，要求各地不折不扣地落实夏粮收购政策，让农民放心售粮。
    今年，因国家压缩信贷规模，各项资金都比较吃紧。对此，山东省确定对粮油收购所需的２８亿多元资金，千方百计地给予保证，坚持做到随收购随兑付现金，不打“白条子”。
    对完成合同定购小麦的农民，省政府规定，坚决把平价化肥、柴油这些挂钩物资如数兑现到户，任何单位和个人不得截留克扣，并继续实行挂钩化肥、柴油凭票定点供应的办法。粮食部门要坚持随收购粮食，随发放票证；供销部门要及时做好化肥、柴油货源的储备，保证农民随时都能凭票买到挂钩物资。
