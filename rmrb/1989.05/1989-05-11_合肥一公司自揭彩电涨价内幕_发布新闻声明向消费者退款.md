Hefei, May 11 (Xinhua) — A company in Hefei recently held a "self-exposure" press conference, revealing the company's violation of price policies to the public, issuing a statement to refund consumers, and seeking societal understanding and supervision.

In January and February of this year, four subsidiaries of Hefei Wireless Electrical Appliances Company sold color televisions at prices that violated price policies to varying degrees. The company's self-inspection revealed that over 200 color televisions were sold at prices exceeding the regulated prices by a few yuan to several hundred yuan, harming consumer interests. The company held a press conference to apologize to consumers and welcomed societal supervision and exposure of the company's implementation of price, industrial and commercial, and tax policies, regulations, and quality service.

To return the interests of consumers, Hefei Wireless Electrical Appliances Company decided: For all color televisions purchased from the company since January 1, 1989, the excess over the prices approved by the price department will be refunded, with interest compensation, and a public apology will be made. For out-of-town consumers who mail in their receipts, the company will return the refund. According to the company's statistics, the total refund amount will be nearly 50,000 yuan.

It is understood that most of the color televisions sold at high prices by the company in January and February of this year were purchased or contracted last year, with purchase prices far exceeding the sales prices at that time, resulting in losses. Manager Zhao Yunpeng stated, "This cannot be used as an excuse or reason for arbitrary price increases and harming consumer interests." They also strengthened ideological and political work and legal education, further improved the management system, and avoided similar incidents.

　　合肥一公司自揭彩电涨价内幕    
    发布新闻声明向消费者退款
    新华社合肥５月１１日电（记者马常青）合肥无线电器材公司日前召开了一次“自我曝光”新闻发布会，将企业违反物价政策的“丑闻”公布于众，声明向消费者退款，以争取社会谅解和监督。
    今年一、二月份，这家公司下属四个单位在经营彩电过程中，不同程度地违反了物价政策；企业自查有２００多台彩电的对外销售价高出当时规定价格几元至几百元不等，损害了消费者利益，公司为此召开新闻发布会，向广大消费者赔礼道歉，并欢迎社会对公司在执行物价、工商、税收政策、法规和优质服务等方面予以监督和揭露。
    为返还消费者被侵犯的利益，合肥无线电器材公司决定：凡自１９８９年１月１日以来在该公司购买的彩电，高于物价部门核准的部分一律退款，并补偿利息，当众赔礼道歉；外地消费者寄来发票，公司将退款寄还。据该公司统计，退款总额将近５万元。
    据了解，这家公司今年一、二月份高价销售的彩电大部分是去年进货或签订合同的，进货价远高于当时的销售价，已发生了亏损。赵云鹏经理表示，“这决不能作为乱涨价、损害消费者利益的借口和理由”。他们还加强了思想政治工作和法制教育，进一步完善经营管理制度，避免类似事件的发生。
