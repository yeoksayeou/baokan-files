	The rural film market is thriving. One-fifth of townships nationwide have cinemas.

	In the context of the increasingly vibrant commodity economy in China's rural areas, film distribution and projection workers are shifting their focus to the vast rural film market. Currently, out of the more than 61,000 townships nationwide, over one-fifth have cinemas, and the conditions for rural residents to watch movies are improving. This information was provided to reporters at a recent national conference on developing the rural film market held in Kunming, the "Spring City," by the China Film Corporation.

	In December 1987, the China Film Corporation held a meeting in Sanming, Fujian Province, proposing the development of the rural film industry and setting the goal of achieving "three transitions": transitioning from collective screenings to ticketed screenings; from outdoor standing screenings to indoor seated screenings; and from showing "small films" to showing "big films." Over the past year, film companies at all levels and film distribution and projection personnel across the country have actively implemented the spirit of the Sanming meeting, working hard to develop the rural film market and achieving commendable results. It is reported that out of the 140,000 rural projection units nationwide, more than 40% have adopted ticketed screenings. In regions where the development of the rural film market has progressed rapidly, a projection network centered around township cinemas and primarily featuring ticketed screenings has basically taken shape; the structure of the national rural projection network has undergone significant changes. The total number of rural cinemas nationwide has reached 12,192; in terms of projection equipment, 35mm projectors have seen a rapid increase, and some regions have completely phased out 8.75mm small projectors. In 1988, both rural projection revenues and distribution revenues exceeded historical highs, reversing the stagnant trend in rural film distribution and projection revenues since 1980.

	However, in the vast rural areas, four-fifths of townships still do not have cinemas, and the conditions for most farmers to watch movies have not improved significantly, with many places still unable to show films to the masses. The work of developing the rural film market nationwide has only just begun.

	To revitalize the rural film market, a rich supply of films is essential. Conference attendees generally reflected that there are too few films that rural residents enjoy watching in recent years. They eagerly hope that relevant authorities will take effective measures to encourage film studios to produce more high-quality films suitable for rural distribution and projection, so that the good momentum in the rural film market can be maintained.

　　农村电影市场势头好
    全国五分之一的乡镇有了电影院
    新华社昆明电  在我国农村商品经济日趋活跃的新形势下，电影发行放映战线的广大职工正在把注意力进一步转向广阔的农村，深入开发潜力巨大的农村电影市场。目前，全国６１０００多个乡镇，已有五分之一多的乡镇有了电影院，广大农民看电影的条件正在得到改善。这是中影公司最近在春城昆明召开的全国开发农村电影市场工作会议上向记者提供的信息。
    １９８７年１２月，中影公司曾在福建省三明市召开会议，提出了发展农村电影事业，实现“三个过渡”的目标，即从靠集体包场看电影逐步过渡到售票看电影；从露天站着看逐步过渡到室内坐着看；从看“小电影”逐步过渡到看“大电影”。一年多来，全国各级电影公司、广大电影发行放映人员积极贯彻“三明会议”精神，为开发农村电影市场付出了艰辛的劳动，取得了可喜的成果。据介绍，全国１４万个农村放映单位，有４０％以上的放映单位实行了售票放映。开发农村电影市场进展快的地区，基本上形成了以集镇电影院为骨干，售票放映为主体的农村放映网；全国农村放映网结构有了明显的变化。全国农村电影院总数已达１２１９２座；在放映设备方面，３５毫米的放映机迅猛增加，部分地区全部淘汰８．７５毫米的小放映机；１９８８年全国农村放映收入和发行收入都超过了历史最高水平，改变了自１９８０年以来电影在农村发行、放映收入徘徊不前的局面。
    然而，广大农村仍有五分之四的乡镇没有电影院，大多数农民看电影的条件依然没有得到多大改善，甚至有许多地方的农民群众还是看不到电影。全国开发农村电影市场的工作，还只是刚刚起步。
    繁荣农村电影市场，离不开丰富的片源。与会代表普遍反映：近年来，为广大农民喜闻乐见的电影太少。他们热切希望有关主管部门采取些得力措施，鼓励各电影制片厂多拍些适合在广大农村发行放映的好影片，使农村电影市场良好势头得以保持。
