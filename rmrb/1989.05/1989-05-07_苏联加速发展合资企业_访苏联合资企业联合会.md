In Moscow today, people can go to the Sino-Soviet joint venture Beijing Hotel to eat dumplings, or to the Soviet-Italian joint venture fast-food restaurant to eat pizza; they can buy new-style women's boots from the Soviet-West German joint venture shoe factory; they can even go to the Soviet-American joint venture computer company to rent a personal computer for individual use...

"In less than two years, 485 Sino-Soviet joint ventures have been established," said Mitrofanov, the executive secretary of the Soviet Joint Venture Association, when he received a reporter from Xinhua News Agency in his office near Red Square. This 40-year-old economist, who has been in charge of the task of linking up Soviet joint ventures for the past five months, said.

In early 1987, the Soviet Council of Ministers made a decision to establish joint ventures within the Soviet Union. On May 12 of that year, the first Soviet joint venture was born, and many units followed suit. However, some were not good at negotiating; some could not find partners; some of the already established joint ventures had poor information and lacked experience, leading to losses; some had their rights infringed upon; some lacked personnel for foreign economic work; some could not find accommodation for foreign businessmen...

In September of last year, about a hundred managers of joint ventures established the Soviet Joint Venture Association, a social organization with legal personality. Since then, the work of establishing Soviet joint ventures has been significantly accelerated.

"Of the 485 joint ventures that have been established, they are distributed in various industries such as industry, commerce, construction, technology, and consulting. West Germany and Finland are the most active, with 53 and 50 respectively. There are 44 joint ventures established with socialist countries, including 4 Sino-Soviet joint ventures," Mitrofanov said with a smile in his bright blue eyes: "I have a small share in the joint venture restaurant opened by Harbin in Khabarovsk (Birobidzhan)!"

He said, "The difficulty with joint ventures is to operate smoothly. They have to bear the foreign exchange profits and losses themselves, and the products have to be exported, but the market is already relatively saturated; the material supply of joint ventures has to be balanced, but the Soviet Union is short of materials; joint ventures need high-quality employees, and Soviet young people have to learn while working..."

"How much is your salary?"

"There are six of us, including me, each earning 400 rubles (the average monthly wage of Soviet workers last year was 217 rubles). There is a lot of work, so we have to work overtime on rest days. The other secretaries are all associate professors, used to hard work. Our salaries come from membership fees. All 485 joint ventures have joined, regardless of the size of the enterprise, each paying an annual membership fee of 3,500 rubles, of which 500 rubles is in foreign exchange."

This executive secretary said that last month, 50 joint ventures were registered and established in just one week. If this trend continues, in a few years, there will be several thousand, with output accounting for more than 10% of the national total, which is not a fantasy.

### 苏联加速发展合资企业——访苏联合资企业联合会

　　苏联加速发展合资企业   
    ——访苏联合资企业联合会
    新华社记者  盛世良
    如今在莫斯科，人们可以到苏中合资的北京饭店吃饺子，到苏意合资的快餐店吃皮扎饼；可以买到苏西德合资鞋厂的新式女靴；甚至还可以到苏美合资的计算机公司租一台个人使用的电脑……
    “不到两年就成立了４８５家苏外合资企业。”苏联合资企业联合会执行干事米特罗凡诺夫日前在红场附近的办公室内接待本社记者采访时说。这位４０岁的经济学博士５个月前挑起了为组建苏联合资企业牵线搭桥的重任。
    １９８７年初苏联部长会议作出了关于在苏联境内建立合资企业的决定。当年５月１２日苏联第一家合资企业问世后，不少单位纷纷效法。但有的不善于谈判；有的找不到伙伴；已经成立的合资企业，有的信息不灵，经验不足，吃了亏，有的权益受侵犯，有的缺乏从事外经工作的人才，有的找不到房子让外商住……去年９月约百家合资企业的经理成立了苏联合资企业联合会这一有法人资格的社会团体。此后，苏联合资企业的组建工作明显加快。
    “已成立的４８５家合资企业分布在工业、商业、建筑、科技、咨询等各行业。西德和芬兰最积极，分别占５３家和５０家。同社会主义国家成立的合资企业共４４家，其中苏中合资的有４家。”米特罗凡诺夫炯炯有神的蓝眼睛露出了笑意：“哈尔滨在哈巴罗夫斯克（伯力）开办的合资餐厅有我的一份小小功劳！”
    他说，“对合资企业，难的是顺利经营。它们的外汇要自负盈亏，产品就得出口，而市场已相对饱和；合资企业的物资供应要均衡，而苏联物资紧缺；合资企业要有高素质的职工，苏联青年只好边干边学……”
    “你们这几位干事工资多少？”
    “连我共６个人，人均４００卢布（去年苏联职工平均月薪２１７卢布）。工作多，只好休息天加班。其他几位干事全是副博士，苦干惯了。我们的工资来自会费。４８５个合资企业全都入会，不论企业大小，每年付会费３５００卢布，其中５００卢布为外汇。”
    这位执行干事说，上月在一周之内登记成立的合资企业就有５０家。照这样的势头，几年后达几千家，产值占全国１０％以上，这并不是幻想。
