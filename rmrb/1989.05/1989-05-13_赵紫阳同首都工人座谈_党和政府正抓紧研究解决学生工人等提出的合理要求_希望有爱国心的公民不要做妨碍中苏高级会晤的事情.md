Zhao Ziyang Talks with Beijing Workers

The Party and Government are Studying and Addressing the Reasonable Demands of Students and Workers

Hopes Citizens with Patriotism Will Not Impede the Sino-Soviet High-Level Meeting

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 13th: General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Zhao Ziyang, said today that the upcoming Sino-Soviet high-level meeting is a significant event that has garnered global attention. The success of this meeting aligns with the interests of the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and is beneficial for world peace and stability. Therefore, all countries are closely watching. Every citizen with patriotism, if they think rationally, will surely strive to uphold the dignity of the motherland and China's international image and will not do anything to obstruct or harm this high-level meeting.

This afternoon, Zhao Ziyang held a talk with worker representatives from Beijing at the Great Hall of the People. Regarding the issue of students reportedly planning to march and demonstrate during Soviet President Gorbachev's visit to China, Zhao said, "I want to tell comrades that the reasonable demands raised by students in recent times, as well as those raised by workers and other masses, are being seriously and responsibly studied and addressed by the Party and the government. Dialogues through various channels and in various forms are being conducted. Party committees and governments at all levels are working tirelessly to improve the economic situation and achieve economic reform. The Central Committee is studying many practical measures and steps to promote democratic and legal construction, strengthen anti-corruption efforts, and advance political system reform, focusing on the hot issues that the masses care about. We are solving these problems step by step. Of course, all our work can only be done within the current conditions and foundations, and it is not possible to make everything perfect overnight. But we will resolutely solve problems on the track of democracy and the rule of law. In late June, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress will list several hot issues that the masses care about as the main agenda, which is a major step in our determination to solve problems through democracy and the rule of law. Despite the fact that people may have various opinions, this is inevitable and normal."

Zhao Ziyang emphasized that whether it is university students or other citizens, if they have objections to the work of their units or the country, they should not interfere with international talks and harm the Sino-Soviet high-level meeting. If such incidents occur, it would be unreasonable and would not gain sympathy or support from the people. He hopes that all students can remain rational, consider the overall situation, and consciously uphold the dignity and interests of the state. For actions that harm national interests and the reputation and image of the Chinese people, do not respond to or support them, and do not do things that hurt the feelings of friends and please the enemies.

　　赵紫阳同首都工人座谈    
    党和政府正抓紧研究解决学生工人等提出的合理要求    
    希望有爱国心的公民不要做妨碍中苏高级会晤的事情
    新华社北京５月１３日电  中共中央总书记赵紫阳今天说，即将举行的中苏高级会晤是举世瞩目的大事。会晤的成功，符合中苏两国人民的利益，也有利于世界的和平与稳定，所以世界各国都很关注。我们每一个有爱国心的公民，只要理智地想一想，都一定会努力维护祖国的尊严和我国的国际形象，都不会做任何妨碍和损害这次高级会晤的事情。
    赵紫阳今天下午在人民大会堂同首都工人代表座谈时，谈到据闻大学生提出要在戈尔巴乔夫主席访华时进行游行示威等行动的问题。他说，我想告诉同志们，近来学生提出的合理要求，工人和其他群众提出的合理要求，党和政府都在认真负责地抓紧研究解决。多渠道、多种形式的对话正在开展。各级党委和政府都在为搞好治理整顿、争取经济形势的好转而进行着艰苦的工作。中央为推进民主和法制建设，加强廉政建设，促进政治体制改革，围绕着群众普遍关心的热点问题，最近正在研究许多实际措施和步骤，扎扎实实地加以解决。当然，我们的各种工作只能在现实的条件和基础上进行，不可能在一夜之间把一切都办得尽善尽美。但我们将坚定不移地在民主和法制的轨道上解决问题。６月下旬全国人大常委会全体会议将把群众关心的若干热点问题列为主要议程，就是我们决心依靠民主和法制解决问题的一个重大步骤。尽管人们可能有这样那样的意见，这是不可避免的，也是正常的。
    赵紫阳强调指出，但是，大学生也好，其他公民也好，如果因为对本单位或国内的工作有意见，就去干扰国际会谈，损害中苏高级会晤，如果出现那样的事，那就没有道理了，就不会得到人们的同情和支持。希望广大同学都能保持理智，顾全大局，自觉地维护国家的尊严和利益。对于那种有损国家利益，有损中国人的声誉和形象的行为，不要响应和支持，千万不要做亲者痛、仇者快的事情。　（附图片）
