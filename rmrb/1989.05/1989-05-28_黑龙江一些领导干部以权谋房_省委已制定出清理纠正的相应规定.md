Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 28th.

Some leading cadres in Heilongjiang have been using their power for personal housing gains, a problem that has been found to be quite serious by a recent investigation conducted by the provincial Discipline Inspection Commission. The Provincial Committee has formulated corresponding regulations to rectify and clean up this issue.

Utilizing their authority to demand more housing and exceeding the regulated area is a widespread issue. Among the vice-bureau level and above cadres in the provincial government, 520 individuals have housing that exceeds the regulated area. In Suileng County, 23 out of 77 bureau-level cadres have housing that exceeds the regulated area, with the most exceeding by 64 square meters. A bureau-level cadre in the Provincial Economic and Trade Bureau has four houses, one of which has been idle for a long time, causing strong public dissatisfaction.

Some leading cadres have misappropriated public funds or arbitrarily allocated funds to buy or build houses or renovate their residences. A bureau-level cadre in Heihe Region misappropriated a special fund totaling 21,600 yuan to buy a house for himself. A deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the Materials Bureau in Wangkui County had five companies under the bureau "assist" him with 400,000 yuan to build four rooms. Among the vice-bureau level and above cadres in Yichun City, 28% used public funds to renovate their houses.

Some leading cadres, under the guise of housing reform, have used their authority to buy public housing at low prices. A deputy director of the Cultural Bureau in Bei'an City bought a 56-square-meter house for only 426 yuan, averaging less than 8 yuan per square meter. A deputy director of Feiketu Town in Acheng City bought a house for 2,800 yuan and then sold it for 17,000 yuan.

The Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission's investigation has drawn high attention from the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee. The Provincial Committee has decided to rectify and clean up the improper practices of Party and government cadres in housing construction according to the following regulations: For housing that exceeds the regulated area by less than 10 square meters, additional rent will be charged; for housing that exceeds the regulated area by more than 10 square meters, the excess part should be returned or the housing should be adjusted; for using authority to renovate housing with public funds, the costs should be reimbursed by the housing owner; for privately transferring, leasing, or selling public housing, the housing should be retrieved and redistributed, and the illegal gains of the parties involved should be recovered; for arbitrarily allocating funds to build private houses, the full amount of funds should be repaid within a limited time, and if repayment is not possible, the property should be used as compensation, etc.

The Provincial Committee also requires further establishment and improvement of various rules and regulations regarding housing construction and publicize these regulations.

　　黑龙江一些领导干部以权谋房
    省委已制定出清理纠正的相应规定
    新华社哈尔滨５月２８日电  （记者张持坚）黑龙江省纪律检查委员会最近的一项调查表明，一些领导干部在住房建房中以权谋私的问题比较严重。省委已制定出清理、纠正的相应规定。
    利用职权多要房，住房超过规定面积，是一个带普遍性的问题。省政府机关副处级以上干部中，住房超过规定面积的有５２０人。绥棱县７７名处级干部中，有２３人住房超过规定面积，最多的超过６４平方米。省经贸厅一名局级干部有４套住房，其中一套长期空闲，群众反映强烈。
    有些领导干部挪用公款或乱拉资金为自己买房、建房或装修住房。黑河地区一名处级干部挪用一项专款共２１６００元，为自己买了一处住房。望奎县物资局党委一名副书记，让物资局下属的５个公司“资助”他４万元，建了４间住房。伊春市副处级以上干部中，用公款装修住房的占２８％。
    有些领导干部借住房改革之名，利用职权低价买公房。北安市文化局一名副局长仅花４２６元，买了一处５６平方米的住房，平均每平方米不到８元。阿城市蜚克图镇一名副镇长用２８００元买的一处住房，转手卖了１７０００元。
    省纪委的这项调查，引起了黑龙江省委的高度重视。省委决定对党政干部在住房建房方面的不正之风，按以下规定清理和纠正：干部住房面积超过规定１０平方米以下的，加收房租，超过１０平方米以上的，原则上退出超过部分或予以调整住房；利用职权用公费装修住房的，费用由住房人偿还；对私自转让、出租或卖掉的公房，收回后另行分配，并追缴当事人的非法所得；对乱拉资金营建私房的，限期偿还全部资金，无力偿还的，以房产抵偿，等等。
    省委还要求进一步建立健全住房建房方面的各项规章制度，并将这些制度公布于众。
