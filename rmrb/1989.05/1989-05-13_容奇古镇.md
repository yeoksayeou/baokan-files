The ancient town of Rongqi is located 20 kilometers south of Shunde County in Guangdong Province. The wide Guangzhou-Zhuhai Highway passes by it, and the famous Shunde tributary and Ronggui Waterway converge here, forming a 100-meter-wide, 10-meter-deep river that flows directly into the mouth of the Pearl River. If you take a boat from Rongqi, it takes more than two hours to reach Hong Kong. The convenience of water and land transportation has made this place an important trading port for Guangdong's foreign trade since ancient times. Now, Rongqi Port has been opened as an open port, with cargo and passenger ships shuttling between Rongqi and Hong Kong every day, making it the third-largest inland port in Guangdong in terms of throughput.

The tide of reform and the fresh air from outside are like the sea tides that surge in from the mouth of the Pearl River every day, constantly impacting this ancient town. High-rise buildings are rapidly emerging, quickly forming a bustling new town next to the ancient town, while the original ancient town is no longer favored by people and is squeezed into a remote corner.

However, I came here specifically to visit this ancient town. In Guangzhou, I heard that Rongqi had experienced an unusual period in history: as early as a hundred years ago, it had undergone a wave of reform and had once been glorious, becoming one of the earliest regions in China to see the emergence of a national capitalist economy. But later, it stagnated and declined. How did this wave rise a hundred years ago? And how did it stagnate and decline? With a love for seeking ancient relics, I wanted to explore a bit. On those remaining 8-meter-wide half-streets, I examined the old wooden shops lined up on both sides. I touched the ancient buildings that, though covered in dust, still retained their charm. I ventured into narrow alleys to visit some elderly people, and I consulted historical materials... I finally found some traces of history.

In the first half of the 19th century, China's maritime ban was lifted for a time. Rongqi, located at the mouth of the South China Sea Bay, with a deep-water port suitable for ships to dock, frequently traded with Southeast Asian countries using three-masted sailing ships. The main foreign trade was the silk produced in the Pearl River Delta. At that time, there was a merchant named Chen Qiyuan in Nanhai's Jiancun village to the northwest of Rongqi. He often sailed to Southeast Asian countries to sell silk and saw that the colonists—British and French—used machines to reel silk, with efficiency several times higher than the primitive manual operation at home. "Seeing the skills of others, sighing at the backwardness of our people," he abandoned commerce to study Western industrial technology and successfully built the first silk-reeling machine in his hometown. Later, in 1866, he established the first modern factory in China operated by national capital—Jichanglong Silk-Reeling Factory. For the first time, the scientific dawn of national hope rose in the south.

However, the backward people did not understand science and did not know how the machine could move on its own. They also complained that the "monster" took away their livelihood. The conservative feudalists were even more disturbed by the clattering sound of the machine day and night, viewing it as an ominous "demon." One day, they finally incited a group of ignorant villagers to rush into the factory, smashing all the machines, and driving out the "culprit" Chen Qiyuan, not allowing him to return to his hometown. Unfortunately, the first reformer in the south ended up with a tragic fate of having no home to return to and no way to serve his country, forced to flee to Macau and die in a foreign land...

But a few years later, his friend moved his technology to Rongqi, which had more contact with the outside world, and successfully established a factory. Afterward, Shunde, Panyu, and other places followed suit, establishing more than 50 machine silk-reeling factories. At that time, Guangdong had four large factories with more than a thousand workers, and Rongqi had three of them, showing the prosperity of Rongqi at that time. According to records, the port was filled with foreign merchant ships, the streets were bustling with merchants, tea houses and restaurants were thriving. At night, the river was decorated with lanterns, and the sound of music lasted all night. A poet named Zhang Lin described the night scene of Rongqi at that time: "Thousands of lanterns shine brightly in the evening, the wind along the street carries the fragrance of hair..."

Unfortunately, this wave only surged a few times and then subsided and fell silent. The main reason for the subsidence and silence was not the attack of external forces but the strangulation of internal mechanisms. The corrupt political system of the feudal era, the backward and blindly xenophobic and arrogant officials, the emphasis on Confucianism over science, and the outdated ideas. Local officials and politicians controlled the factories and monopolized the product sales rights. They were shortsighted, only seeking to fill their own pockets, and did not pay attention to cultivating talents, valuing knowledge, and developing science and technology. As a result, this good industrial baby shrank in the cradle and could not grow up. Until the eve of liberation, the machines used were still the iron-wood machines made by Chen Qiyuan a hundred years ago, causing Rongqi, and China's industry, to lag behind the West by a hundred years. This is a great historical tragedy!

Rongqi, you are a historical witness to this tragedy.

In the afternoon, I came to the Rongqi Industrial Research Institute, where I was received by Comrade Chen Fuxing. We talked about the unfortunate history of Rongqi's industry, and he was also full of emotions. Fortunately, in the past ten years, Rongqi's industry has once again surged, especially the development of township enterprises has been very fast, with 70% of the labor force entering industry. They have also recruited many engineering and technical personnel and workers from outside. The products are no longer silk but mainly household industrial products such as hardware and electrical appliances. Although some factories are not large, they have introduced advanced equipment from abroad, and many products have entered the international market. A representative example is the Zhujiang Refrigerator Factory.

Initially, when he and the factory director Pan Ning started this township-run refrigerator factory, people laughed at them: "You, a township-run factory, can't even rank as a county-level unit, only as a section-level unit, can you make refrigerators? Even ghosts wouldn't believe it." They took the risk and struggled for a few years, not only succeeded but also became famous nationwide. Their "Rongsheng" brand refrigerators are even exported to Southeast Asia and Western Europe.

Bidding farewell to Old Chen, I slowly walked to the new town area of Rongqi. Unlike the old town's desolation, here the crowd surged like a tide, tea houses, restaurants, and various companies were everywhere, and the sound of machinery echoed everywhere, like a symphony of surging tides. Seeing all this, I suddenly thought of the prosperous and fleeting scene of Rongqi a hundred years ago, and I couldn't help but feel a mix of emotions... Of course, today's social conditions are completely different, and the historical tragedy will not be repeated. But I think, using history as a mirror, looking back at what suffocated the reform back then and caused a hundred years of stagnation, may have some enlightening effect on us today.

　　容奇古镇
    白井
    它位于广东省顺德县城南２０公里处。
    宽敞的广（州）珠（海）公路从它身边穿过，著名的顺德支流和容桂水道在它这儿汇合，形成一条百米宽十米深的大河直泻珠江口。如果从容奇坐船，两个多小时就到了香港。水陆交通之便，使这儿很早就是广东对外贸易的重要商埠。如今，容奇港又开辟为对外开放口岸，每日货轮客轮穿梭般奔忙于容奇与香港之间，吞吐量列广东内河港第三位。
    改革的大潮，外界的新鲜空气，就像天天从珠江口外袭来的海潮一样不断冲击着这座古镇。高楼大厦一幢幢树立起来，很快在古镇旁形成一座繁华的新镇，而原先的古镇再也得不到人的垂爱，被挤到冷僻的一隅去了。
    然而，我是专奔这座古镇而来的。在广州时我就听说，容奇曾有过一段不寻常的历史：早在一百年前，它就经历过一场改革大潮的冲击，也曾荣耀一时，成为我国最早出现民族资本主义经济的地区之一。可是后来停滞了，败落了。这股浪潮是怎么在百年前兴起的？又是如何停滞和败落的？我怀着一种寻古的癖好想去探求一二。在那些残存的８米来宽的半截子街上，我审视着两旁那密匝匝排列着的木头结构的陈旧铺面。我抚摸着那些虽蒙着岁月的尘垢但风韵犹存的朱阁水寮，我钻进陋巷访问一些耄耋老人，我查阅一些历史资料……到底找到了一星半点历史的轨迹。
    １９世纪上半叶，我国海禁一度开放。容奇因处在南海海湾的喇叭口内，且有一个深水的适合船舶停靠的港口，便经常与东南亚各国用三枝桅风帆船通商，对外贸易主要经营珠江三角洲所产的蚕丝。当时容奇西北边的南海简村有个叫陈启源的商人，经常坐着风帆船到东南亚各国销售蚕丝，看到那里的殖民者——英国人和法国人都用机器缫丝，工效比家乡原始的手工操作高出几十倍。“感他人之技长，叹国人之落后”，他抱着救国宏志，弃商而钻研西方工业技术，终于成功地在故乡造出第一架缫丝机，继而又于１８６６年创办了中国第一家民族资本经营的近代工厂——继昌隆缫丝厂。首次在南国升起了寄托民族希望的科学的新曙光。
    可是，落后的国人不懂科学，不知道这机器怎么自己会动，且埋怨这“怪物”夺了他们的饭碗。守旧的封建国粹派们更是被那嚓嚓嚓的机声震得日夜不安，把它视为不吉的“妖物”。一日，终于煽动一群愚昧的乡民冲进工厂，将机器全部砸了，并把“祸首”陈启源赶出简村，不许他再回故乡落脚。可怜南国的第一位改革家竟落得个有家难投，报国无门的悲惨结局，不得不逃到澳门定居、客死他乡……
    但数年后，他的友人又将他的技术移至与外界接触较多的容奇一带，继续创办工厂成功。之后，顺德、番禺等地竞相仿效，先后办起机器缫丝厂５０余家。当时，广东千人以上的大厂有四家，容奇就占了三家，可见当时容奇的兴盛繁华。据资料载，那时港口中外商船簇聚，街道商贾如云，茶楼酒馆生意兴隆。入夜，河面张灯结彩，笙歌彻夜。有位叫张琳的诗人是这样描写当时的容奇之夜的：“朝去暮回千灯艳，沿街风送鬓云香……”
    可惜，这股大潮只热热闹闹澎湃了几下子，就消退了、沉寂了。消退沉寂的原因主要不在外部力量的攻击，而是内部机制的扼杀。封建时代腐败的政治制度，官僚们落后而又盲目排外、盲目自大，重经儒而轻科学，思想观念陈腐。当地官僚政客控制工厂，垄断产品经销权，他们鼠目寸光，只求大饱私囊，哪里注意培养人才，重视知识，发展科技？致使这个好端端的工业婴儿萎缩在摇篮里，再也长不大。直至解放前夕，使用的竟还是百年前陈启源做的铁木机，使容奇，也使中国工业整整落后西方一百年。这是多么大的历史悲剧！
    容奇，你是这场悲剧的历史见证。
    下午，我来到容奇工业研究所，接待我的是陈福兴同志。我们谈起容奇工业不幸的历史，他也感慨万端。所幸的是近十年来容奇工业重新掀起大潮，特别是乡镇企业发展极快，７０％的劳力都转入了工业，还从外地招来不少工程技术人员和工人。产品不再是丝，而是以五金、电器为主的民用工业。别看一些厂子规模不大，但多是从国外引进先进设备，不少产品已打入国际市场。其中有代表性的是珠江冰箱厂。
    想当初，他和厂长潘宁拉起这个镇办冰箱厂时，人家笑话他们：“你一个镇办厂，连科级也排不上，只算个股级，能搞成冰箱？鬼也不信。”他们冒着风险，几年奋斗，不仅搞成了，而且蜚声全国。他们生产的容声牌冰箱还远销东南亚和西欧。
    辞别老陈，我才慢慢踱到容奇新镇区。一改旧镇的冷落，这里人群如潮，茶楼酒馆、各类公司林立，四处传来的机器声直震耳鼓，像在合奏一支大潮奔腾曲。眼前这一切，忽又使我想起百年前容奇繁华促逝的一幕，不禁百感交集……当然，今天的社会条件已完全不同，历史的悲剧再不会重演了。但我想，以历史为镜，回头看看当年是什么窒息了那场改革，造成百年停滞的局面，对我们今天也许多少有一点启迪作用的。
