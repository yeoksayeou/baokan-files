According to the National Bureau of Statistics, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China, six key economic indicators show that from January to April, fixed asset investment decreased, credit expanded monthly, and industrial economic benefits continued to decline.

It is reported that from January to April, the completed investment in fixed assets by state-owned units was 30.4 billion yuan, a decrease of 3.6% compared to the same period last year. The credit scale shows a monthly expansion trend. By the end of April, the total loan balance of banks nationwide was 1061.5 billion yuan, an increase of 63.78 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. In particular, fixed asset investment loans increased, with the number of regions increasing investment loans from 4 in the first quarter to 9 by the end of April, indicating a trend of credit supporting investment expansion.

The economic indicators also show that labor productivity is slowly increasing. The labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises with independent accounting increased by only 0.6% in January and February compared to the same period last year, but it has since rebounded, with a 3.1% increase from January to April. The industrial sales tax rate continues to decline. From January to April, the sales tax rate for state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises was 17.44%, a decrease of 1.88 percentage points compared to the same period last year. At the same time, the cost of industrial products continues to rise. From January to April, the comparable product cost for state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises increased by 17.1%, an increase of 10.8 percentage points compared to the same period last year, with almost all regions across the country experiencing an increase.

    头四月固定资产投资有所减少
    本报讯  国家统计局、国家计委、财政部、中国人民银行日前公布的六项重要经济指标表明：１至４月，固定资产投资有所减少，信贷逐月扩大，工业经济效益还在下滑。
    据介绍，１至４月，全民所有制单位固定资产投资完成额为３０４亿元，比去年同期下降３．６％。信贷规模呈逐月扩大的态势。４月末，全国银行各项贷款余额达１０６１５亿元，比年初增加６３．７８亿元。尤其是固定资产投资贷款在增加，４月末比年初增加了投资贷款的地区由一季度的４个扩大到９个，信贷又有支持投资扩大的趋势。
