By the early hours of May 31, a statue titled "Goddess of Democracy," created collectively by more than 20 teachers and students from the Sculpture Department of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, was placed on the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square. It attracted tens of thousands of onlookers. This unauthorized erection of the "Goddess of Democracy" also sparked objections from Tiananmen Square Management Office and a middle-aged female intellectual from a certain design institute under the State Council.

Despite the strict restrictions on foreign and domestic journalists imposed by the second and third martial law proclamations issued by the Beijing Municipal Government, several cameras from foreign and Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan journalists remained set up on the third level of the base of the monument.

    5月30日：
    天安门广场即景
    本报北京5月31日凌晨讯  由中央美术学院雕塑系20多名师生集体创作的“民主之神”雕像，安放在天安门广场人民英雄纪念碑北侧，吸引着数以万计的围观者。这个未经批准搭设“民主之神”的举措，也引起了天安门管理处和国家机关某委设计院一位女中年知识分子的异议。
    尽管北京市政府第二、第三号戒严令中，对中外记者采访有严格限制，在纪念碑第三层台基上，外国和港澳台记者的数架摄像机仍然支在那里。
