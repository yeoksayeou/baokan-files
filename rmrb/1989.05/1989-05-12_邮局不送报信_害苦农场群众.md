Our farm has thirty department-level enterprises and institutions with a population of 124,000. For many years, the postal service has only set up a sub-bureau in the farm headquarters to handle postal business and does not deliver newspapers, periodicals, and letters to various enterprises, institutions, offices, production teams, and residents. As a result, each unit has to send someone to the post office to pick them up. This often causes urgent telegrams to be delayed, and daily newspapers to become "weekly" or even "monthly" publications, causing much dissatisfaction among the people.

　　邮局不送报信  害苦农场群众
    我场有三十个处级企事业单位，人口十二点四万。多年来，邮电部门只在场部设一个办理邮政业务的支局，不负责向各企事业单位、机关、生产队和居民投递报刊信件。这样，各单位就只好派人去邮局取。为此，常有加急电报被耽误，日报往往变成“周报”、“月报”，群众很有意见。
