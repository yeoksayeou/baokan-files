The Worldwatch Institute in the United States today released a report titled "National Security from an Economic and Environmental Perspective," stating that as global tensions ease, national security depends on economic development and environmental protection rather than military strength.

The report points out that in the 20th century, many countries' large-scale military expansions actually weakened rather than strengthened national security. Meanwhile, this arms race has destroyed their economic development. Currently, the threat posed by global environmental pollution is forcing humanity to consider national security from a broader perspective rather than relying solely on military power. Seeking military security at the expense of economic development, social justice, and ecological balance is akin to "demolishing the house to build the wall."

The report states that since the war, there have been 120 local conflicts worldwide, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 million people. Many countries have adopted a policy of being "always ready for war," leading to continuous depletion of resources. The rapid increase in military spending has actually undermined the economic stability of these countries because it hinders research and development in social civilization and education, reduces labor productivity, weakens international competitiveness, and burdens them with heavy debt.

The report notes that due to the arms race between superpowers, global military spending has reached nearly one trillion dollars annually. Countries spend far more on military research and development than on research in energy, health, agriculture, and environmental pollution control. In the United States, 45% of government and private enterprise research and development spending is allocated to military purposes.

The report believes that if the natural protective systems on which human activities depend are destroyed, then environmental damage is equivalent to destroying the most fundamental security factor for all countries. Environmental pollution is a threat that knows no borders. Desertification, deforestation, cross-border air and water pollution, and the inherent dangers of nuclear power plants not only threaten the security of the affected countries but also endanger the security of other countries in the world. Global warming and ozone depletion pose threats to the health and economic life of all humanity, from which no country can escape.

The report points out that in the 1990s, preventing soil erosion, reforesting the earth, and developing renewable energy would only require 10% of the current annual global military spending. In a world where humans share a single biosphere, interdependence has become a rule. Therefore, the concept of national security based on military strength is outdated. Many countries have begun to realize that national security does not depend on the size of their armies but on the extent to which they promote global cooperation.

### 美国《世界观察研究所》报告认为  在世界局势日趋缓和的条件下  国家安全取决于经济而非军力

　　美国《世界观察研究所》报告认为
    在世界局势日趋缓和的条件下
    国家安全取决于经济而非军力
    本报华盛顿５月２７日电  ：美国“世界观察研究所”今天发表一份题为《从经济和环境角度看待国家安全》的研究报告，认为随着世界局势的缓和，国家安全不是取决于军事力量的强弱，而是取决于经济发展和环境保护。
    报告指出，在２０世纪，许多国家大规模扩充军事力量的做法实际上削弱了而不是加强了国家安全。与此同时，这种军备竞赛破坏了各自的经济发展。当前，全球环境污染造成的威胁，正迫使人类从更广泛的角度来考虑国家安全问题，而不是单纯依靠军事力量。以牺牲经济发展、社会公正和生态平衡的代价来谋求军事安全等于是“拆房屋修院墙”。
    报告说，战后世界各地发生过１２０场局部战争，至少有２０００万人在战争中死亡。许多国家采取了“时刻处于战备状态”的政策，结果造成资源的不断耗竭。急剧膨胀的军费开支实际上破坏了这些国家的经济稳定，因为它妨碍了对社会文明和教育的研究与发展，减低了劳动生产率，削弱了国际竞争能力并背上了沉重的债务负担。
    报告指出，由于超级大国的军备竞赛，全世界每年的军费开支已接近万亿美元。各国仅在军事研究与发展方面的开支就远远超过了它们用于能源、卫生、农业生产和控制环境污染等方面研究的开支。在美国，政府与私人企业的研究与发展开支中４５％是用于军事目的。
    报告认为，如果破坏了人类活动所依赖的自然保护体系，那么对环境的破坏也就等于破坏了各国最根本的安全因素。环境污染造成的危害是不分国界的。土地沙漠化，森林遭到破坏，跨越边境的空气与水污染以及核电站固有的危险，不仅仅危及当事国的安全，而且也同样危害世界其他国家的安全。全球性的气温变暖和臭氧层减少对全人类的健康与经济生活构成威胁，这是任何国家都逃脱不了的。
    报告指出，在９０年代，要防止土壤侵蚀、重新绿化地球和发展再生能源只需目前世界军费年度开支的１０％。在人类共同分享一个生物圈的世界上，相互依存已成为一条准则。因此，建立在军事实力基础上的国家安全的概念已经过时。许多国家已开始认识到，国家安全不是取决于其军队的大小，而是取决于它们促进全球性合作的程度。
