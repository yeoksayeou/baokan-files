Beijing students' May Fourth parade ended peacefully. This development restored confidence among investors in the Hong Kong stock market, leading to a sharp rise in stock prices. On May 4, the Hang Seng Index in the Hong Kong stock market surged by 65.9 points, reaching 3221.12 points, the highest level since the 1987 stock market crash. This morning, after the market opened, the upward trend continued, and by noon, the Hang Seng Index reached 3257 points.

In recent periods, due to the upward trend in international stock markets, the Hong Kong stock market also showed signs of recovery. However, the student protests and class boycotts in mainland China caused Hong Kong investors to worry about potential violent conflicts, leading to cautious attitudes in the stock market. Trading was sluggish, and stock prices did not show the expected upward trend, sometimes even experiencing slight declines.

Hong Kong securities industry insiders expressed relief upon seeing the peaceful conclusion of the student parade and the announcement of a full resumption of classes. They actively entered the market to invest, leading to a significant rise in stock prices.

　　北京学生“五四”游行平静结束    
    香港股票价格猛升
    新华社香港５月５日电  （记者陈晓彬）北京学生“五四”游行和平结束，令香港股票市场投资者恢复信心，股票价格急升。５月４日这一天，香港股票市场的恒生指数猛升６５．９点，达到３２２１．１２点，创下１９８７年股票市场大暴跌以来的新高峰。今日上午股票市场开市后，承接昨天升势继续攀升，中午收市时恒生指数达３２５７点。
    近一个时期来，由于国际股票市场行情上升，香港股票市场也出现回升迹象。但是内地发生学生游行罢课事件，香港投资者担心酿成暴力冲突，对股票市场持谨慎态度，交易淡静，股票价格未出现预期的升势，有时甚至小幅度下降。
    香港证券界人士表示，他们看到学生游行和平结束并宣布全面复课后，感到欣慰，积极入市投资，致使股票价格劲升。
