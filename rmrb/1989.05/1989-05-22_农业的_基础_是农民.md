The foundation of agriculture is the farmers. The fate of agriculture is not determined by grain but by the farmers themselves. In the past 30 years, we focused on grain as the foundation, but the grain problem was not solved. After the reforms, it took only five or six years to significantly improve the grain situation. Later, agriculture stagnated, and the fundamental issue was that the farmers' enthusiasm was dampened.

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy, which is undeniable. Then, what is the foundation of agriculture? The prevailing view is that grain is the foundation of the foundation. This view emphasizes the importance of grain. However, importance does not equate to being the foundation. Whether from the historical development of agriculture or from the current state of agriculture, the foundation of agriculture and the determinant of its fate is not grain but the farmers themselves, with the core being their enthusiasm.

The foundation of agriculture is the farmers, which has been repeatedly proven by the practice of China's agricultural development. Before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, we followed the idea that grain is the foundation of agriculture, even elevating grain to the status of the "key." What was the result? After so many years, the problem of basic subsistence was not solved. The fundamental reason was that under the constraints of the "leftist" ideology, farmers, who were confined within the old system of "one big and two publics," had no autonomy in production and operation, and thus no enthusiasm for production. Focusing on grain as the so-called foundation, we neglected the true foundation, the farmers, thereby shaking the foundation of agriculture in the national economy. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the old system of "one big and two publics" was reformed, and the household contract responsibility system was implemented, establishing the farmers' position as the main body of operation and mobilizing the farmers' enthusiasm. Only then did agricultural production rapidly develop. The grain problem, which had not been solved in 30 years, was basically resolved in just five or six years. In recent years, grain production has once again shown signs of stagnation. What is the reason? People often emphasize the reduction in agricultural investment, natural disasters, and the decrease in sowing area as objective reasons. However, the most fundamental issue is that the farmers' enthusiasm has been dampened.

What has dampened the farmers' enthusiasm? The common explanation is that prices are unreasonable, production materials have increased in price, and the comparative benefits of growing grain have decreased. Taking Jilin Province, the largest commercial grain base in the country, as an example, the overall index of agricultural and sideline product procurement prices in 1988 increased by 7% compared to 1987, while the overall index of rural industrial product retail prices increased by 15.9%. However, prices are just a manifestation. The deeper reasons are: first, the government adopts a "whip and stick" policy and "one-sided contracts" for agricultural and sideline products, not accepting more and forcing the acceptance of less, causing a significant portion of the farmers' lawful earnings to be swallowed up by unequal exchange; the economic losses caused by the imbalance in macro-control during the reform are shifted to the farmers through non-economic means. In a sense, prices not only reflect labor value but also concretely represent the position of a certain product, the industry producing that product (such as industry, agriculture, etc.), and the production department (industrial enterprises, farmers, etc.) in the national economy, especially under the conditions of a planned commodity economy. Second, the long-term policy of favoring cities has become even more pronounced in recent years. The scale of urban construction is getting bigger and bigger, while investment in agriculture is getting smaller and smaller. The policy tilt also encourages farmers' production and operation behavior to become more short-term, lacking the momentum for agricultural production development. Third, departmental interests are expanding maliciously, with all sides reaching out to the farmers. Some departments, under the guise of reform, shift the burden to the farmers, while some departments, exceeding economic capacity, engage in various "large-scale" projects and forcibly impose levies on the farmers.

The problems of agriculture and grain, in the end, are the problems of farmers. How the farmers' problems are solved affects the prosperity of agriculture and influences the overall national economy. Solving the farmers' problems is key to mobilizing their enthusiasm and activating their internal drive to improve agricultural production. The farmers' internal drive mainly comes from their pursuit of legal rights and material interests. If social conditions adapt to and guarantee the farmers' drive, their enthusiasm and creativity will be fully realized. Conversely, their enthusiasm will be suppressed and dampened. Summarizing past experiences, the most fundamental way to handle this issue is to fully respect the farmers' autonomy and insist on dealing with the farmers on the principle of equivalent exchange. Protecting the farmers' interests and mobilizing their enthusiasm will enable the material, financial, and technological inputs of agriculture to achieve their intended effects.

　　农业的“基础”是农民
    决定农业命运的不是粮食，而是农民本身。过去３０年抓了粮食这个基础，粮食未解决；改革以后仅用五六年时间，粮食状况就大为改观。其后农业徘徊，根本问题是挫伤了农民的积极性。
    田雨丰
    农业是基础，就国民经济大系统而言，是毫无疑义的。那么什么是农业的基础？流行的观点是，粮食是基础的基础。这种观点旨在强调粮食的重要作用。但是，重要并不等于是基础。无论就农业发展的历史，还是就农业的现状来谈，构成农业的基础，决定农业命运的不是粮食，而是农民本身，核心是他们的积极性。
    农业的基础是农民，这是为我国农业发展实践所反复证明的。党的十一届三中全会前，我们曾按照粮食是农业基础的思路抓农业，甚至把粮食抬到了“纲”的位置。结果怎样呢？搞了那么多年，温饱问题都解决不了。根本原因，是在“左”的束缚下，被框定在“一大二公”旧体制中的农民，没有生产经营自主权，没有生产积极性。抓了粮食这个所谓的基础，丢了农民这个真正的基础，动摇了农业这个国民经济基础。党的十一届三中全会后，改革了“一大二公”的旧体制、实行了家庭联产承包制，确定农民的经营主体地位，调动了农民的积极性，农业生产才迅速发展起来。３０年没有解决的粮食问题，仅用五六年时间就基本解决了。近几年粮食生产又出现了新的徘徊，原因何在？人们多在强调农业投资的减少、自然灾害以及播种面积减少等客观原因，但是最根本的则是农民的积极性受到挫伤。
    是什么挫伤了农民的积极性呢？普遍的说法是价格不合理，生产资料涨价，种粮的比较效益下降。以全国最大商品粮基地的吉林省为例，农副产品收购价格总指数１９８８年比１９８７年提高７％，而农村工业品零售价格总指数却提高１５．９％。但是，价格毕竟是一种表象。其深层的原因：一是政府对农副产品采取“刀鞭”政策和“单边合同”，多了不收，少了硬要，使农民合法劳动所得的相当一部分被不等价交换所吞噬；改革中由于宏观调控失衡造成的经济损失，通过非经济手段转嫁到农民身上。从一定意义上讲，价格不仅反映劳动价值，而且是某种产品，生产该产品的产业（如工业、农业等）和生产部门（工业企业、农民等）在国民经济中地位的具体体现，在有计划的商品经济条件下，尤其如此。二是长期采取的向城市倾斜政策，近几年更加厉害。城市基建规模越来越大，而对农业的投资却越来越小。政策的倾斜，又促使农民生产经营行为越来越短期化，农业生产发展后劲不足。第三是部门利益恶性膨胀，四面八方向农民伸手。有些部门以改革名义，向农民转嫁负担，有些部门，超越经济承受能力，搞各种“大办”，向农民强行摊派。
    农业问题，粮食问题，说到底是农民问题。农民问题解决的如何，事关农业的兴衰，左右国民经济的全局。解决农民的问题，关键是调动他们的积极性，启动他们搞好农业生产的内在动力。农民的这种内在动力，主要来自于对合法权益和物质利益的追求，社会条件适应保证农民的这种冲动，他们的积极性和创造性就会得到最大限度的发挥。反之，积极性就会受到压抑、挫伤。总结以往的经验，处理好这个问题，最根本的是要充分尊重农民的自主权，坚持按等价交换原则与农民打交道。保护农民利益，调动农民的积极性，才能使农业的物资、资金、技术等投入，发挥应有的效益。
