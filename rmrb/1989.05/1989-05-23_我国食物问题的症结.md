	The Crux of China's Food Problem

	Reporter Chen Zujia

	Zhou Yongchun, male, born in 1940, is currently a deputy researcher at the China Science and Technology Promotion Development Research Center of the State Science and Technology Commission. After graduating from Beijing Agricultural University, he continued his studies at Peking University, earning a master's degree in science. He has long been engaged in research on the development strategy of biotechnology and has written articles such as "Predictions and Strategies for the Development of the Biotechnology Industry by the Year 2000."

	Reporter: "Food is the primary necessity of the people." Solving the food problem for 1.1 billion people is a matter of utmost importance. The Party and the government have proposed to guide the establishment of a food structure with Chinese characteristics. Please share your views on the food problem.

	Zhou Yongchun: Last year, we conducted some investigations and research on China's food problem. From the overall level of food consumption, the amount of animal-based food that our people eat is increasing. According to a sample survey by the National Bureau of Statistics, in 1987, the per capita purchase of animal-based food by urban residents in China was 43.2 kilograms, an increase of 8.6 kilograms compared to 1981, while the purchase of grain, converted into raw grain, decreased by 14.4 kilograms during the same period. In 1987, farmers consumed an average of 17 kilograms of animal-based food per person, an increase of 9.4 kilograms compared to 1978. After people have enough to eat, they naturally eat more animal-based food. This is very natural.

	Reporter: What standard should be used to increase animal-based food?

	Zhou Yongchun: It should be based on ensuring health. If a person does not have enough animal protein, it is impossible to ensure health.

	Reporter: Can you specify this standard?

	Zhou Yongchun: The animal-based food of Westerners is quite sufficient, but it is not reasonable. The diet structure that is relatively recognized worldwide is that of the Japanese. Japanese people obtain 19.3% of their daily average required calories and 51% of their protein from animal-based food. In comparison, the food of Chinese people has a gap. According to calculations by relevant departments, in 1985, the average daily calories obtained by each person in China from food was 2548 kilocalories, reaching the standard suggested by nutritionists for the end of the century. However, only 6.9% of this came from animal-based food, and only 16% of the protein came from animal-based food. In 1987, the per capita consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products in China was 29.4 kilograms, which was 27% of the per capita value in Japan in 1985 and 22% of the world average.

	Reporter: According to your view, the lack of animal-based food is the crux of China's food problem.

	Zhou Yongchun: Yes. This is a problem that we must strive to solve in the future.

	Reporter: Some experts believe that China's grain production is limited, and raising pigs consumes a lot of grain, so the consumption of animal-based food cannot increase rapidly, and there are even views to curb the consumption of animal-based food.

	Zhou Yongchun: Undoubtedly, the amount of grain per capita is the foundation for the development of animal husbandry. In the past five or six years, China's grain production has been basically stable. If there is to be a significant increase, it will still take considerable effort and time. However, the main reason for the lack of animal-based food in China is not the limited grain.

	Reporter: How do you see this?

	Zhou Yongchun: Take 1985 as an example. The per capita grain available in Japan was almost equal to that in China, and the per capita feed available was only 1.5 times that in China, but the per capita production of meat, eggs, and dairy products was 4.1 times that in China. Looking at the overall input-output, the total amount of feed input in China was 5.8 times that in Japan, but the production of meat, eggs, and dairy products was only 2.1 times that in Japan. From this, it can be seen that the amount of grain and feed is not the decisive factor. The two main factors that play a decisive role in increasing animal-based food are the product structure and the level of scientific and technological development, including management level.

	Reporter: Please give a specific analysis of these two factors.

	Zhou Yongchun: Let's still use Japan as a comparison. In the per capita consumption of meat, eggs, and dairy products, dairy products with a high feed conversion rate account for 56.7% in Japan, eggs and poultry meat account for 27.4%, and pork with a lower feed conversion rate accounts for 11.7%; in China, dairy products account for 10.7%, eggs and poultry meat account for 25.2%, and pork with a lower feed conversion rate accounts for 60.3%.

	In the past, we have always emphasized that "pigs are the leader of the six domestic animals," which has led decision-making departments to always regard pig raising as the key to the development of animal husbandry. The animal-based food of the Chinese people has always been mainly pork. This concept and situation need to change. Now, we should pay more attention to the development of poultry, eggs, fish, and dairy products.

	Reporter: Most ordinary people still prefer to eat pork.

	Zhou Yongchun: I am not saying that we should reduce the production of pork. The reduction of pork often causes psychological fluctuations among people, leading to social instability. This is not a purely technical issue and needs to be handled with caution. But the feed conversion rate of pigs is too low, and increasing one kilogram of pork often requires more than seven or eight kilograms of grain, which is not cost-effective. In the case of limited grain, maintaining the current level of pork production is also acceptable.

	Reporter: Some experts believe that the dairy industry should be given priority in agriculture to solve the problem of insufficient animal-based food. What do you think?

	Zhou Yongchun: According to our investigation, we do not fully agree with this view. It is true that from a scientific point of view, the feed conversion rate of cow's milk is relatively high. However, eating more dairy products requires a process of adaptation for most people in China; moreover, the development of dairy cows requires excellent pastures and a large number of high-quality dairy cows, which will be difficult to achieve in the next 10 years. On the contrary, if we prioritize poultry and fish farming, it may be more practical and faster. On the one hand, chickens and fish are easy to raise, and farmers can produce them in their own households. As a food, it also suits the taste of most people in China. On the other hand, the feed conversion rate is relatively high.

	Reporter: In addition to the product structure, China's feed production technology, breeding level, and feed conversion rate also have a significant gap with developed countries.

	Zhou Yongchun: Therefore, the fundamental way to solve China's food problem is to rely on technological progress. Last year, we proposed 10 suggestions for the development of animal husbandry on this issue.

	Reporter: Please give a brief introduction to these suggestions.

	Zhou Yongchun: First, gradually establish a feed crop planting industry to change the current situation of using grain as feed. Strengthen the selection and promotion of high-protein feed corn. Second, gradually replace single feeds with complete compound feeds. Third, adopt multiple approaches to solve the problem of protein feed shortages. Fourth, develop aquatic feeds and other substitutes for grain. Fifth, establish a breeding and propagation system for high-quality livestock and poultry. Sixth, establish a social service system for the prevention and treatment of livestock and poultry diseases. Seventh, strengthen scientific guidance to improve the current extensive breeding environment. Eighth, develop ecological farming and scientifically utilize resources in a comprehensive and multi-level manner. Ninth, strengthen the research and development of biotechnology. Tenth, gradually guide the development of moderately scaled intensive farming. If we focus on these 10 points and make efforts for 10 years, the food structure and nutritional level of the Chinese people will definitely be improved.

　　我国食物问题的症结
    本报记者  陈祖甲
    周永春，男，１９４０年生，现为国家科委中国科技促进发展研究中心副研究员。他于北京农业大学毕业后，继续就读于北京大学，获理学硕士学位。长期从事生物技术发展战略研究，撰写过《２０００年生物技术产业发展预测与对策》等论文。
    记者：“民以食为天”。解决１１亿人口食物问题是一件头等重要的事情。党和政府提出要引导建立具有中国特色的食物结构。请您谈谈对食物问题的看法。
    周永春：去年，我们曾对中国食物问题作过一些调查研究。从总的食物消费水平看，我国人民吃的动物性食品在增加。据国家统计局的抽样调查，１９８７年我国城镇居民人均购买动物性食品为４３．２公斤，比１９８１年增加８．６公斤，而同期购买的粮食折合成原粮减少了１４．４公斤。农民１９８７年人均消费的动物性食品为１７公斤，比１９７８年增加９．４公斤。人们在吃饱之后，多吃一些动物性食品。这是很自然的。
    记者：增加动物性食品以什么标准为宜？
    周永春：应该以保证身体健康为标准。一个人如果没有足够的动物蛋白补充是不能保证健康的。
    记者：您能否具体说一说这个标准？
    周永春：西方人的动物性食品相当充足，但并不合理。世界上较公认的是日本人的膳食结构。日本人每日平均需要热量的１９．３％和蛋白质的５１％是从动物性食物中摄取的。相比之下，中国人的食品就有差距。据有关部门测算，１９８５年，我国每人每天平均从食物中摄取热量为２５４８千卡，已达到营养学家建议的本世纪末的标准。但是，其中来自动物性食品的仅占６．９％，来自动物性食物的蛋白质仅占１６％。１９８７年，我国人均肉蛋奶占有量为２９．４公斤，是１９８５年日本人均值的２７％，是世界人均值的２２％。
    记者：按您的意思，动物性食物不足是我国食物问题的症结所在。
    周永春：是的。这是我们今后必须努力解决的问题。
    记者：有的专家认为，我国粮食生产有限，养猪又费粮食，所以动物性食品不能增加很快，甚至还有平抑动物性食品消费的观点。
    周永春：毫无疑问，人均占有粮食的数量是发展养殖业的基础。近五六年我国粮食生产基本稳定，若要有一个大的增长，还需要花费相当大的功夫，有一些时日。但是，我国动物性食物不足主要原因并非是粮食有限。
    记者：何以见得？
    周永春：以１９８５年为例，日本人均占有的粮食与我国几乎相等，人均占有的饲料仅为我国的１．５倍，而人均肉蛋奶的产量却是我国的４．１倍。再从总的投入产出上看，我国投入的饲料总量为日本的５．８倍，而肉蛋奶产量仅为日本的２．１倍。由此可见，粮食和饲料量少的，生产的肉蛋奶不一定少，相反，投入多的产出也不一定多。
    记者：按这个统计，我国同日本生产同样数量的肉蛋奶，所花费的饲料是人家的３倍，太不经济了。
    周永春：所以关键并不在于人均占有粮食和饲料量的多少。对增加动物性食物起决定作用的主要是两大因素，一是产品结构，二是科学技术水平，包括管理水平。
    记者：请您对这两大因素作出具体分析。
    周永春：我们还以日本作为比较对象。在肉蛋奶的人均占有量中，日本的饲料报酬率高的奶占５６．７％，蛋和禽肉占２７．４％，猪肉占１１．７％；我国的奶占１０．７％，蛋和禽肉占２５．２％，而饲料报酬率较低的猪肉占６０．３％。
    过去，我们一直强调“猪为六畜之首”，致使决策部门始终把养猪作为发展养殖业的重点。我国人民的动物性食品也一直以猪肉为主。这个观念和这种状况需要转变。现在应该重视禽、蛋、鱼以及奶的发展。
    记者：大多数老百姓还是爱吃猪肉的。
    周永春：我不是说要减少猪肉的生产。猪肉的减少往往会引起人们心理的波动，造成社会的不安定。这不是一个单纯的技术性问题，需要慎重处置。但猪的饲料转化率太低，增加一公斤猪肉往往要花费七八公斤以上粮食，太不上算。在粮食不多的情况下，猪肉生产保持现有水平也就可以了。
    记者：有的专家认为农业应把奶牛业放在首位，以解决动物性食品的不足。您怎么看？
    周永春：根据调查，我们不完全同意这种意见。不错，从科学上说，牛奶的饲料转化率比较高。但是，多吃奶制品，对我国大多数人来说，还需要一个习惯过程；再说发展奶牛需要优良的草场，更需要大量增殖良种奶牛，这在１０年内都难以见成效。相反，如果我们把养鸡、养鱼放在首位，也许更切合实际些，来得更快些。一则鸡、鱼容易养，农民一家一户都可以生产。作为食品也符合我国大多数人民的口味。二则饲料转化率比较高。
    记者：除了产品结构之外，我国的饲料生产技术、饲养水平和饲料转化率也与发达国家有较大差距。
    周永春：因此说，解决我国食物问题的根本途径在于依靠科技进步。去年，我们就这个问题提出发展养殖业的１０条建议。
    记者：请您将这些建议作个概要的介绍。
    周永春：一、逐步建立饲料作物种植业，改变目前以粮食为饲料的状况。加强高蛋白饲料玉米的选育和推广应用。二、逐步以全价配合饲料替代单一饲料。三、采取多条途径解决蛋白饲料匮缺的问题。四、开发水生饲料等替代粮食的饲料。五、建立畜禽良种的选育、繁育体系。六、建立畜禽疫病防治的社会服务体系。七、加强科学指导，改善目前粗放的饲养环境。八、发展生态养殖，科学地综合多级利用资源。九、加强生物技术的研究和开发。十、逐步引导开展适度规模的集约化经营。抓好这１０条，经过１０年努力，我国人民的食物结构和营养水平一定会得到改善。
