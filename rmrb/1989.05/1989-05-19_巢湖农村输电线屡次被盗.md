Over the past two years, four counties in our region have experienced frequent cases of bare aluminum wires being stolen.

In Wuhui County, more than 70 townships have reported incidents of bare aluminum wires being stolen. From last November to this February, Niujia Du Township alone had 10 such cases, resulting in direct economic losses of 15,000 yuan. Xia Yingchun, Zhai Kaihui, and others were caught in early March, and more than 30 kilograms of bare aluminum wires that had not yet been sold were seized from their homes. From January 12 to March 24 this year, Bujie, Shili, Chengbei, and Chengnan in He County reported a total of 14 cases of bare aluminum wire theft. In the village of Xinxu Administrative Village in Bujie Township, there were six theft cases, resulting in losses of over 2,000 yuan.

　　巢湖农村输电线屡次被盗
    近两年来，我地区四个县都接连不断发生裸铝线被盗案件。
    无为县七十多个乡镇都发生裸铝线被盗案件。牛家渡乡从去年十一月至今年二月共发生十起裸铝线被盗案，直接经济损失一万五千元。这个乡的夏迎春、翟开辉等人于三月初被抓时，从他们家中搜出尚未销出的裸铝线三十多公斤。今年一月十二日至三月二十四日，和县卜集、十里、城北、城南等地共发生盗窃裸铝线案十四起。卜集乡新圩行政村一个村就发生六起盗窃案，损失两千多元。
