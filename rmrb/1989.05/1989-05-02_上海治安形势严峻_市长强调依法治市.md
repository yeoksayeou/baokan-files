	Shanghai Faces Severe Public Security Situation
	Mayor Emphasizes Rule of Law

	According to a report by this newspaper, although a survey conducted at the end of last year indicated that 70% of Shanghai residents felt safe, a document presented at the opening of the ninth session of the Shanghai People's Congress revealed that the city's public security situation is severe and some issues are quite prominent.

	The document shows that Shanghai's social public security situation is severe, with some problems being quite prominent.

	The number of major criminal cases has surged.
	Last year, Shanghai reported over 15,000 criminal cases. In the first quarter of this year, major criminal cases increased by nearly 90% compared to the same period last year. Among these, cases of major theft, fraud, and speculation for financial gain have surged; previously rare crimes such as drug-facilitated robbery, kidnapping with hostages, robbing taxis, premeditated armed robbery, hijacking, and piracy have also emerged. Crimes committed by outsiders and recidivism by individuals released from prison or labor reform have become prominent, and gang crimes have resurfaced, some with clear signs of organized crime.

	Social public security problems are on the rise.
	In some areas of Shanghai, gambling is rampant, with many participants and some bets reaching tens of thousands of yuan. Additionally, the street sales of obscene audio-visual products have occurred multiple times. Illegal trading of scarce commodities and securities is also quite prominent. These phenomena have caused concern among Shanghai residents.

	Relevant officials in Shanghai analyzed that the sharp increase in prices, the prominent supply-demand contradictions, and social inequities inevitably lead to the intensification of social conflicts and disputes. Various forms of corruption and improper practices within the party and society have also increased factors of instability. Meanwhile, a large number of floating population has made crimes committed by outsiders a prominent issue affecting Shanghai's public security.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji emphasized in his "Government Work Report" the need to severely and swiftly punish crimes in accordance with the law. He stated that for prominent public security issues, regular inspections and specialized rectifications will be conducted promptly, social prevention mechanisms will be improved, and the management of outsiders will be strengthened to ensure the stability of residents' lives.

　　上海治安形势严峻    
    市长强调依法治市
    本报讯  虽然去年底的一份抽样调查表明，７０％的上海市民有安全感，但近日在这里开幕的上海市第九届人民代表大会第二次会议提供的一份材料却不容人们对上海的治安形势持乐观态度。
    这份材料表明：上海社会治安形势严峻，有些问题还相当突出。
    重大刑事案件大幅度上升。
    去年上海刑案发生总数１５０００多起。今年一季度，重大刑案比去年同期增加近９成。其中以图财为目的的重大盗窃、诈骗、投机倒把等案件猛增；过去不多见的麻醉抢劫、绑架劫持人质、抢劫出租汽车和预谋持枪抢劫、劫机、劫船等不少；外来人员犯罪和刑满释放、解除劳动教养人员重新犯罪的情况比较突出，团伙犯罪又有所抬头，有的带有明显的黑社会性质。
    社会治安问题有增无减。
    上海一些地区赌风甚烈，不仅参赌的人多，有的赌资竟高达数万元。此外，街头贩卖淫秽音像制品已多次出现。非法倒卖紧俏商品、有价证券等交易活动也相当突出。这些现象已引起上海市民的忧虑。
    上海市有关人士分析说，物价上涨幅度过大、供需矛盾突出、社会分配不公等不可避免地导致社会矛盾激化和纠纷增多。
    各种腐败现象、党内和社会不正之风，也使不安定因素增多。同时，大量的流动人口使外来人员犯罪成为影响上海治安的突出问题。
    据中新社报道，上海市长朱熔基在他的《政府工作报告》中强调要依法从重从快严惩犯罪，对突出的治安问题将抓紧经常性查处和专项治理，完善社会防范机制，加强外来人口管理，使市民生活安定。
