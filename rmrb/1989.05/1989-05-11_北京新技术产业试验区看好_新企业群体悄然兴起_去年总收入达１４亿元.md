Beijing's New Technology Industrial Development Experimental Zone saw its total revenue reach 140 million yuan last year, a 55.6% increase over the previous year.

This experimental zone, the only one among the more than 20 new and high-tech development zones in the country to be approved by the State Council, now covers an area of 100 square kilometers, far exceeding the former "Zhongguancun Electronic Street" and accounting for about one-quarter of Haidian District. Its industrial structure has also broken away from the single-electron technology enterprise pattern, with a group of new and high-tech enterprises in biotechnology, new materials, new energy, opto-electro-mechanical integration, and space technology quietly emerging.

According to Hu Zhaoguang, director of the experimental zone, out of the current 700 enterprises, 71% are established by research institutes, colleges and universities, and military-industrial enterprises. Among the 13,000 full-time staff, about 70% have a college education or higher, including 46 PhDs and 631 Masters.

Last year, the experimental zone approved 1,618 new technology products while approving enterprises, of which 33 are key technology products. The industrial output value of the experimental zone reached 500 million yuan, achieving a tax revenue of 150 million yuan, and earning 13 million US dollars in foreign exchange from exports. The per capita output value is 40,000 yuan, and the per capita tax revenue is 13,000 yuan. These figures place the experimental zone at the top among new technology development zones nationwide.

It is understood that the experimental zone has formulated several policies to promote the development of high and new technology industries and is currently working on drafting the development strategy and industrial outline for the experimental zone.

　　北京新技术产业试验区看好    
    新企业群体悄然兴起    
    去年总收入达１４亿元
    本报北京５月１１日讯  记者陈祖甲报道：北京新技术产业开发试验区去年的总收入达到１４亿元，比上一年增长了５５．６％。
    这个在全国２０多个新技术、高技术开发区中唯一经过国务院认可的试验区，目前面积已达１００平方公里，大大超出了过去“中关村电子一条街”范围，约占海淀区的１／４；产业结构也突破了单一电子技术企业的格局，一批从事生物技术、新材料、新能源、光机电一体化、空间技术等新技术、高技术企业群体正在悄然兴起。
    据试验区主任胡昭广介绍，目前７００家企业中，７１％是由科研院所、大专院校、军工企业创办的。１３０００名专职人员中，大专以上文化程度的约占７０％，其中有４６名博士、６３１名硕士。
    去年，试验区在审定企业的同时，审定了１６１８项新技术产品，其中３３项为技术拳头产品。试验区的工业产值达到５亿元，实现利税１．５亿元，出口创汇１３００万美元，人均创产值４万元，人均创利税１．３万元。这在全国新技术开发区中名列榜首。
    据了解，试验区已经制定了一些促进高技术、新技术产业发展的政策，并且正在着手研究编制试验区的发展战略和产业大纲。
