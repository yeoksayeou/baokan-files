People from Dalian say that when a chicken lays an egg, it clucks loudly, but when a duck lays an egg, it is larger but makes no noise. We should learn from the duck's spirit, do more practical work, and talk less. This indeed reflects a bit of Dalian's economic construction style.

In construction, there is no task that can be accomplished without effort. As stated in "Xunzi: Cultivation of the Self," "The path may be near, but without walking, one will not reach the destination; the task may be small, but without doing it, it will not be accomplished."

Doing, however, has different methods. Some people work diligently, like Dalian, quietly and unobtrusively. At first glance, you might not see many new achievements, but after some time, you will notice that the environment has improved, the quality of enterprises has been enhanced, and economic benefits have become apparent. Others are not like this; they do things to follow the trend, making a lot of noise on the surface, but the foundation does not change much, and their ability to withstand changes in the external environment is also relatively weak. This kind of "doing" is criticized by the people as "face work."

To say that we should start from reality and do more practical work, these words have probably been said too many times. Yet, in actual work, this remains a fairly common problem. Perhaps someone thinks, "Only a fool would do those labor-intensive things," so they are eager to do things that require "little effort but gain great fame." Haven't you seen that in some places, people leave the impression of "producing experiences but not benefits"? This is directly related to not focusing on doing practical work.

A lack of practical spirit is also manifested in the desire for quick success. Many people know that "haste makes waste," a principle proposed in Confucius' time, yet this mistake of seeking quick success appears repeatedly today. For those in charge, wanting to leave some achievements is understandable. But economic construction has its internal economic laws, just like an orchard. Planting fruit trees, cultivating, and pruning take three years or five years before bearing fruit. If you plant a fruit tree and want to pick fruit immediately, pulling the saplings to help them grow, isn't that foolish? Some people know the principles but do not follow them, and it cannot be denied that there is a lot of personal consideration involved. This is an important reason why some people cannot work diligently and do practical work.

May more leaders embody the spirit of practicality, use solid work to promote reform, and promote economic construction!

　　务实为本
    小可
    大连人说，鸡下个蛋咯咯嗒嗒叫个不停，鸭子下蛋比鸡的大，却不吭声。要学点鸭子精神，多干实事，少嚷嚷。这的确带有一点大连经济建设的特色。
    搞建设，没有哪一件事是不干就能成的。《荀子·修身》中说：“道虽迩，不行不至；事虽小，不为不成。”
    干，又各有各的干法。有人埋头干，像大连，静悄悄的，一下子真看不出有多少新套套，可是过一段时间看，环境改变了，企业素质提高了，经济效益显出来了。有的人不是这样，干那些赶“形势”的事，表面上热热闹闹，名声大，但基础部位并没有多少变化，承受外界环境变化的能力也比较弱。这种“干”，鼓虚劲，群众批评为“面子活”。
    要说从实际出发，多干实事，这些话恐怕都说滥了。可是，在实际工作中呢？却仍然是个相当普遍存在的问题。或许有人心里想，傻瓜才干那些费大力的事，所以，热衷于干那些“费小劲，得大名”的事情。君不见，有些地方留给人们的感觉：出经验不出效益。这与不注重干实事是有直接关系的。
    务实精神不强，还有一种表现，那就是急于求成。许多人都知道欲速则不达，是孔老夫子时代就提出来的，到今天，急于求成的错误却屡屡出现。为“官”一方，想留下一点业绩，心情可以理解。但经济建设有它内在的经济规律，就像那果园一样，栽果树、培植、修理，有的三年，有的五载，方有果实。如果栽下果树就想摘果，拔苗助长，岂不是干的蠢事。有的人道理归道理，干归干，不能不说是掺杂了许多个人考虑。这是一些人不能踏踏实实干实事的重要原因。
    务实为本，愿更多的领导者发扬务实精神，用扎实的工作去推进改革，推进经济建设！
