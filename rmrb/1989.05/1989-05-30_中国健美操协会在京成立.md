The Chinese Aerobics Association was established in Beijing recently, approved by the State Sports Commission.

Aerobics, as a popular sport, is gaining increasing popularity worldwide. In recent years, the aerobics movement in China has spread rapidly and has attracted more and more enthusiasts.

Relevant departments believe that to organize and plan the development of this sport domestically, to strengthen technical guidance and academic research, and to facilitate international exchanges, it is necessary to establish a national unified organization. The Chinese Aerobics Association, as a specialized sports organization, will guide and coordinate aerobics organizations at the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels, contributing to the health of the Chinese and world peoples.

The Chinese Aerobics Association is chaired by Yin Zili, with Xue Deming, Xu Huanzhi, and Sun Yukun serving as vice-chairpersons. Sun Yukun also serves as the secretary-general. The association's executive committee is composed of individuals from the sports and various sectors of society, with sub-committees including the Judging Committee, Technical Committee, Research Committee, Economic Committee, and International Liaison Committee.

An international aerobics invitational competition will be held in Hong Kong in October this year. The Chinese Aerobics Association is already organizing a representative team to participate in this competition.

    中国健美操协会由殷子烈任主席，薛德明、徐唤芝、孙玉昆任副主席，孙玉昆兼秘书长。协会的执委会由体育及社会各界人士组成，下设裁判委员会、技术委员会、科研委员会、经济委员会和对外联络委员会。
