The first commercial bonded warehouse in China, jointly built by the Tianjin Port Authority and the Royal Dutch Shell Group, has officially begun operations in Tianjin Port.

Located just two kilometers from the dock, the Tianjin Port Commercial Bonded Warehouse covers an area of over 40,000 square meters and is equipped with advanced office facilities and four warehouses, each with a capacity of 5,000 square meters. These warehouses, which use shelf-based three-dimensional storage, computer management, and automatic sprinkler systems, allow imported goods from abroad to be stored free of charge until they receive market clearance in the importing country, in accordance with international practices.
