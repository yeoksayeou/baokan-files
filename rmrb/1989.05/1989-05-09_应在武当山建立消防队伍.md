	Wudang Mountain in northwestern Hubei Province has more than 20,000 rooms of buildings from the Tang and Song dynasties, which are precious cultural relics of the state.

	However, Wudang Mountain has suffered several fires. In recent years, fire alarms and fire accidents have occurred frequently, directly affecting the safety of ancient buildings.

	The main unsafe factors for Wudang Mountain's ancient buildings are as follows: a large number of tourists flock to the mountain, setting off firecrackers, burning incense, and paper money, creating many fire hazards; many units are constructing buildings on Wudang Mountain, increasing fire sources and dangers. Additionally, fire safety management is poor, making it difficult to carry out fire prevention work, and there is a lack of fire-fighting funds, making it impossible to purchase essential fire-fighting equipment.

	To prevent these precious cultural relics from being destroyed in our hands, I believe that a fire brigade should be established on Wudang Mountain to make the fire management of Wudang Mountain standardized and scientific.

　　应在武当山建立消防队伍
    鄂西北武当山上保存的唐宋时代建的两万多间房屋，是国家的珍贵文化遗产。
    然而，武当山曾多次遭受火灾。近几年来，火警火灾事故时有发生，直接影响到古建筑的安全。
    武当山古建筑的不安全因素主要有：大批游客涌上山，燃放鞭炮，焚香烧纸，火险隐患大量存在；不少单位在武当山大兴楼堂馆所，火源增多，危险增大。另外，安全防火管理不善，防火工作难以开展，缺乏消防经费，必备的灭火器材无法购置。
    为了不让珍贵的文化遗产在我们这一代人手中毁掉，我认为，应在武当山建立消防队伍，使武当山的消防管理规范化、科学化。
