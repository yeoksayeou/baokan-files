Chen Yiyuan of the Qinghai Provincial Academy of Social Sciences, in his work "A Survey and Analysis of Ideological Change in the Western Region and Qinghai during the Primary Stage of Socialism," points out that the backwardness of social and economic conditions in China's western regions has led to a low level of human quality, which in turn constrains the development of society and the economy. To break this vicious cycle, it is necessary to sever one of the key links, which is to achieve an update in people's ideology and improve their quality. Based on extensive surveys, he divides the ideological changes occurring in the western regions under the impact of the reform and opening-up wave into three levels: First, in provinces and autonomous regions where the commodity economy is relatively developed and ideological updates are relatively fast, such as central cities, they can play a role in "setting the trend"; Second, in medium and small towns and along railway lines in various provinces and autonomous regions, there is hope that they will become "windows" for ideological change in their respective provinces and autonomous regions; Third, in vast mountainous and pastoral areas, the task of ideological updating is particularly arduous.

To rapidly develop the first level, improve the second level, and eliminate the third level, in addition to emphasizing the conventional step-by-step method of ideological promotion, it is also necessary to adopt the "center radiation" method of ideology based on the actual situation in the west. That is, using cities and towns with relatively developed commodity economies and more advanced ideologies as centers, radiating new ideas in a fan-shaped manner outward, and driving the ideological changes in surrounding areas. The characteristic of this method is that the center blooms, from point to surface, affecting the surrounding areas, and producing an ideological change effect. Today, in addition to some central cities in the west, many relatively backward regions have also emerged with a number of "star points." Various provinces and autonomous regions should cultivate them in a planned manner and fully utilize their central radiation role in ideological change.

    加快西部观念变革要靠“中心辐射”方法
    青海省社会科学院陈依元在《社会主义初级阶段西部与青海观念变革的调查分析》中指出，我国西部地区社会经济落后造成人的素质低下，而人的素质低下又反过来制约了社会经济的发展。为了打破这一怪圈，应该斩断其中一个关键的环节，这就是实现人的观念更新、提高人的素质。他根据大量的调查，把在改革、开放大潮冲击下西部地区正发生着的观念变革分为三大层次：一是各省区中心城市等商品经济比较发达、观念更新比较快的地方，可发挥“开风气之先”的作用；二是各省区的中小城镇、铁路沿线等地，它们有希望成为本省区观念变革的“窗口”；三是广大山区与牧区，观念更新的任务尤为艰巨。
    为了较快地发展第一层次，提高第二层次，消灭第三层次，除了重视常规的观念梯次推进方法外，还要根据西部实际采用观念“中心辐射”方法。即以各个商品经济较发达、观念较先进的城镇为中心，成扇面地向外辐射新观念，带动周围地区的观念变革。其特点是中心开花，由点到面，波及四邻，产生观念变革效应。今天西部除一些中心城市外，许多相对落后的地区也已出现了一批“明星点”，各省区应有计划地培植它们，充分发挥其在观念变革中的中心辐射作用。
