	Ten-Year Memorial
	Liu Jianchu

	In the blink of an eye, it has been ten years. Heaven and earth, life and death, all seem so vast and distant!

	Ten years ago, war suddenly broke out in the southern border. The young and strong sons of the Republic, facing the massive military flag, made solemn vows. With just a bowl of strong parting wine, their courage could ignite half the sky. Then came lightning and thunder, bloodshed and chaos. Even the earth trembled in terror, while young lives bravely faced death!

	At that moment, faith was condensed into a single "V." Life thus became simple—either standing tall and resolute, or silently falling. No longer was there any need for adornments to decorate life.

	Ten years ago, he, he, and he all had vibrant, youthful bodies. Life, before them, was full of mysteries, tempting them with countless illusions. Was it merely because there were no disco halls then, no dances that could make their vigorous lives surge and twist like thunder, that they threw themselves into the turmoil of blood and fire to release the heat that their bodies could not contain?

	In reality, they were all ordinary lives.

	He, because he was poor and in debt. He once jokingly said, "If I die, I'll have money to pay off my debts." Unfortunately, his words came true! Indeed, he died. Indeed, the compensation money paid off his debts. Today, there are many ways to make money, and most people have learned to haggle during transactions. I ask, in the underworld, is he truly without resentment?

	He, simply because he was going to war. And simply because he could not escape the eternal truth that "war means death," the girl left him. He swore to the heavens that after the war, he would find a girl even more beautiful than her. However, the landmines on the battlefield shattered his vengeful thoughts! If he had lived. And if that girl was indeed more beautiful than her, would ten years of wind and rain make many things fade away, and would the girl's debt of love be forgiven, interest and principal?

	He, at that time, was only seventeen. Carefree and always feeling that time passed too slowly. Because he did not believe that people could grow old. Ten years later, at twenty-seven. "Confident in a life of two hundred years, ready to strike the waves three thousand miles." So youthful and handsome. Indeed, seventeen froze in fire and blood! He will never grow old. Youth will be eternal!

	Today, where is he? Where is he? Where is he again? These purified souls have long since cast off the world's grievances and freed themselves from the endless desires of the mundane world.

	The wreaths at the foot of the mountain have scattered and flown away;
	The wreaths at the foot of the mountain are forever etched in the heart!

	For the living world, ten years is enough to grow a great tree, enough to build a new city, enough to bring about historical changes... It is long, yet it is brief.

	For the dead world, ten years make no difference in length. There, time is unnoticed, with no distinction between morning and night; space is one, with no distinction between north and south, east and west.

	But death has always been the foundation for life.

	Life will stubbornly reappear in new forms. Mountains endure, rivers flow, grass turns green, trees stay green, people endure...

    十年祭
    刘建初
    转眼就是十年。天上人间，生死两茫茫！
    十年前，南疆骤起烽烟。共和国精壮的儿女，面对着硕大的军旗，誓言锵铿。只需一碗醇烈的壮行酒，那豪气便可烧红半边天。接下来，电闪雷鸣、血光翻飞。连大地都恐怖地颤抖，而一个个年轻的生命却直面着死亡！
    在那样的时刻，信念被浓缩得只剩下一笔“V”。生命也由此而变得简洁——或者凛然而立，或者默然仰倒。不再需要任何装扮生命的饰物。
    十年前，他，他，还有他，都曾具有一幅鲜灵的、青春跃动的躯体。人生，在他们面前是无数个谜，诱幻出无数个奢望。难道仅仅是因为那时还没有迪斯科舞厅，还没有能使精血蓬勃的生命如霹雳般辗转腾挪的舞姿，他们才置身于血与火之中去翻滚摸爬，以释放躯体难以容纳的热能吗？
    其实，那都是一些普通的生命。
    他，因为穷，欠了债。他曾自嘲“死，俺就有钱还债了”。不幸言中！果真，他死了。果真，抚恤金抵偿了债务。今天，赚钱的方式多了，绝大多数的人都学会了在交易时讨价还价。敢问九泉之下的他，果真是死而无怨吗？
    他，仅仅因为要去打仗。也仅仅因为他不可能颠扑“打仗要死人”这一万古不变的真理，姑娘就离弃了他。他指天发誓，战后，一定要找一位比她更漂亮的姑娘。然而，冲锋路上伏设的地雷彻底粉碎了他报复的意念！假如，他活着。再假如，他的那位真的比她更漂亮，十年的风雨，会使许多东西淡漠，姑娘欠他的情债，会连本带利一笔勾销吗？
    他，当初才十七岁。无忧无虑。总嫌时间过得太慢。因为，他不相信人会老。十年后，才二十七。“自信人生二百年，会当水击三千里”。多风流倜傥。果真，十七岁在火与血中凝固了！他不会老了。年轻将成为永远！
    今天，他，在哪？他，在哪？他，又在哪？这些被净化了的亡灵早已抛却了世间的恩恩怨怨，解脱了凡俗那不尽的企求。
    高山下的花环散落纷飞了；
    高山下的花环凝铸在心中！
    对于活着的世界，十年，足以长成一株大树，足以崛起座新城，足以发生历史性的变革……它是漫长的，也是短暂的。
    对于死了的世界，十年，无所谓长短。在那里，时间，浑然不觉，无分子午寅卯；空间，浑然一体，无分南北东西。
    可死历来都是为活奠定根基。
    生命会以崭新的表现方式顽强地再现。山长在、水长流，草长绿、树长青，人长久……
