The acacia trees in Qingdao are in full bloom in May, their flowers as white as snow, and bees buzzing among them, bringing a taste of fresh honey to the city's residents.

Qingdao has many acacia trees within its urban area. Starting from mid-May, the rich fragrance of the acacia blossoms attracts beekeepers from all over.

Along some of the city's roads, you can see rows of white beehives and simple triangular shade tents, adding a touch of rural charm to this coastal city.

During this season, many beekeepers come to Qingdao. There are about a hundred locations in the city where they set up their hives. Each group brings dozens of hives, and they can harvest honey every two or three days. They then pack the freshly harvested acacia honey into various containers and wait under the acacia trees for customers to buy.

This year, acacia honey is priced at over 5 yuan per kilogram, slightly more expensive than in grocery stores, but residents still bring jars and bottles to buy fresh acacia honey under the shade of the acacia trees. An elderly woman bought a large bottle of fresh acacia honey at a stall near the entrance of Zhongshan Park and happily showed it to the reporter, "Look how clear this honey is."

　　青岛五月槐蜜甜
    新华社青岛５月２５日电  （记者刘海民）５月的青岛满树槐花如银似雪，群群蜜蜂穿梭在花丛中，给这里的市民带来了尝新蜜的口福。
    青岛市区内多槐树，自５月中旬起，那浓郁的槐香便引来了各地大批放蜂人。
    在市内的一些道路旁边，可以看到一排排白色的蜂箱和一顶顶临时搭起的简易三角小凉棚，这些颇有点田园风味的小景，给这座海滨城市凭添了一种野趣。
    这个季节，来青岛放蜂的人很多，在市区约有上百个点。每一伙放蜂人都带着数十个蜂箱，二三天就可以摇一次蜜。他们将新酿出的槐蜜装在各式各样的桶里，然后就在路边的槐树下等候尝鲜者。
    今年的槐花蜜，每公斤５元多，价格虽比食品商店卖得贵一点，但市民们还是拿着瓶瓶罐罐到槐荫下买新槐蜜。一位老大娘在中山公园门口的一个摊上买了一大瓶新槐蜜，乐滋滋地晃动着给记者看：“你瞧瞧，这蜜多透亮。”
