    The other day, I had a fortunate encounter. I met an old friend from my hometown. We hadn't seen each other for many years. We were both surprised and delighted to see each other. We reminisced about the old times and shared stories about our lives since we last met. It was a wonderful experience that reminded me of the importance of friendship and the joy of unexpected reunions.
