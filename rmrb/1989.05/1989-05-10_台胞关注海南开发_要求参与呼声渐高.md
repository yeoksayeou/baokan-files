Taiwanese Concern for Hainan Development Grows, Calls for Participation Increasing

	According to a report from the Hong Kong edition of the Hainan Daily, recently, with the release of the development policies for Hainan's Yangpu, the issue of participating in the development of Hainan Island has garnered widespread attention in Taiwan. Several "legislative committee members" and economists have expressed their views, urging the authorities to actively participate in the development and construction of Hainan Island.

	These Taiwanese individuals pointed out that participating in the development of Hainan not only benefits the mainland but also significantly benefits Taiwan's economic development.

	Taiwan "Legislative Committee Member" Huang Zhwen believes that Taiwan currently has an excess of capital, and labor-intensive industries are becoming increasingly difficult to operate. If the Taiwanese authorities guide private enterprises to form large-scale, planned investment and development companies targeting Hainan Island, it will help solve the above problems. He also pointed out that Taiwan's participation in the development of Hainan Island can be carried out through third-party or international organizations as guarantors, by leasing Hainan Island land, accepting commissioned development, or joint development.

	Taiwanese renowned economist Hou Jiaju published an article titled "Can Hainan Island Be Developed on Behalf?" He said: Taiwan's participation in the development of Hainan Island can yield significant economic benefits. In terms of trade, increasing the market for Hainan Island residents, coupled with the demand generated by development investments, will reduce Taiwan's dependence on external trade. In terms of production, many Taiwanese businesses are seeking overseas investment opportunities. Participating in the development of Hainan will allow companies to invest in upstream, midstream, and downstream sectors in a coordinated manner, improving the profitability and opportunities for investing businesses.

	Professor Bian Yuyuan, Director of the International Trade Department at National Taiwan University, proposed a plan similar to Huang Zhwen's, which involves leasing, commissioned development, or joint development.

　　台胞关注海南开发  要求参与呼声渐高
    本报海口５月１０日电  据《海南日报》香港消息；最近，随着海南洋浦开发政策出台，有关参与开发海南岛的问题在台湾引起广泛关注，一些“立法委员”和经济学家纷纷发表言论吁请当局积极参与海南岛的开发建设。
    这些台湾人士指出，参与开发海南不仅对大陆有利，实质上对台湾的经济发展亦裨益甚大。
    台湾“立法委员”黄主文认为，台湾目前资金泛滥，劳力密集产业经营日趋困难，若由台湾当局指导民间，筹组有规模、有计划的投资开发公司，以海南岛为目标，将有助于上述问题的解决。他还指出，台湾参与开发海南岛可透过第三者或国际机构之担保，以承租海南岛土地、或接受委托开发、或合作开发等方式进行。
    台湾著名经济学家侯家驹发表题为《海南岛能否代为开发》的文章说：台湾参与开发海南岛可以从中获得较大经济效益，在贸易上由于增加海南岛居民的市场，再加上开发投资所导致的需求，将可为台湾减少对外贸易的依赖；在生产上，台湾很多业者在寻觅对外投资机会，参与海南开发，厂商们可以组团方式，作上、中、下游配合性投资，对投资的业者可提高获利水准及机会。
    台湾大学国际贸易系主任边裕渊教授提出的方案跟黄主文的基本相同，即承租、委托或共同开发。
