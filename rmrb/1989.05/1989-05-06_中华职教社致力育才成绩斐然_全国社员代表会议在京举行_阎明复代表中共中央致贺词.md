Representatives from more than 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as from Hong Kong and Macau, totaling 148, attended the 1989 National Congress of the China Vocational Education Society held this morning at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

Yan Mingfu, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a congratulatory speech expressing warm congratulations. He said, "We must, through various channels, strengthen vocational education and continuing education for workers, and strive to build a labor force that is highly skilled and disciplined. The comrades of the China Vocational Education Society who have worked hard to develop vocational education in our country deserve the respect and gratitude of the entire society." Xi Zhongxun, Sun Qimeng, Li Tieying, and others attended the meeting.

The China Vocational Education Society was founded in Shanghai in May 1917 by Mr. Huang Yanpei, along with 48 other prominent figures from the educational and industrial sectors, including Cai Yuanpei, Liang Qichao, Zhang Jian, and Song Hanchang. The society is both an educational organization dedicated to vocational education and a political organization committed to the independence, freedom, democracy, and prosperity of the motherland. In recent years, the society has made significant achievements, earning praise from relevant government departments and people from all walks of life.

This national congress of the China Vocational Education Society will see a change of leadership, review the work report of the Fifth Executive Committee, amend the charter, and elect the Sixth Executive Committee.

　　中华职教社致力育才成绩斐然    
    全国社员代表会议在京举行
    阎明复代表中共中央致贺词
    本报北京５月６日讯  来自全国２０多个省、市、自治区及港、澳地区的１４８名代表，今天上午出席在北京人民大会堂举行的中华职业教育社１９８９年全国社员代表大会。
    阎明复代表中共中央致词表示热烈祝贺。他说，我们要通过各种途径，加强对劳动者的职业教育和在职继续教育，努力建设起一支素质优良、纪律严明的劳动大军。为发展我国职业教育事业辛勤工作的中华职教社的同志们，理应受到全社会的尊重和感谢。习仲勋、孙起孟、李铁映等出席了大会。
    中华职业教育社是１９１７年５月由黄炎培先生联合教育界、实业界知名人士蔡元培、梁启超、张謇、宋汉章等４８人在上海成立的。职教社成为既是从事职业教育的一个教育团体，又是致力于祖国的独立、自由、民主、富强的一个政治团体。几年来，职教社的工作取得了显著成绩，博得了政府有关部门和各界人士的赞扬。
    这次职教社全国代表大会，将进行换届，审议第五届理事会工作报告，修改章程和选举第六届理事会。
