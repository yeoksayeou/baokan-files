Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, and Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh regime, held their fourth round of talks here this morning to seek a solution to the Cambodian problem.

The meeting began at 9 a.m. local time and lasted for over two hours. According to reports, Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann, Prime Minister of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, and Hun Sen discussed issues such as the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, the cessation of foreign aid to Cambodian resistance forces, international supervision of the Vietnamese withdrawal, and the change of the national flag. They also discussed issues related to the state's religion, constitution, and the role of political parties. The talks will continue this afternoon.

After the morning session, Hun Sen told reporters that he welcomed Prince Sihanouk's return to Cambodia as a national leader. Hun Sen also said that he and Prince Sihanouk would hold talks in Paris on July 24. On July 25, the four Cambodian factions will hold a meeting in Paris.

	BEIJING, May 2 (Xinhua) — In the fourth round of talks held in Jakarta today, Prince Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, and Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh regime, agreed to expand the scope of the international supervision mechanism proposed by Vietnam for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and to stop foreign aid to the Cambodian warring parties after the complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops.

	A spokesman for Prince Sihanouk told our reporter over the phone this evening that Prince Sihanouk emphasized that the compromises reached with Hun Sen on the above two issues were not the final agreement. Because he must first reach a consensus with the Democratic Kampuchea and Son Sann.

	BEIJING, May 1 (Xinhua) — Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh regime, said today that he would make certain concessions in his talks with Prince Sihanouk, Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, in Jakarta.

	The concessions Hun Sen mentioned involve changing the name of the Phnom Penh regime from "People's Republic of Kampuchea" to "State of Cambodia," as well as changing the national flag and national anthem of the Phnom Penh regime.

	Hun Sen said during his stopover in Bangkok en route to Jakarta that he believed this round of talks in Jakarta was very important. Even if all issues could not be resolved, at least some progress could be made.

	Hun Sen and Prince Sihanouk held three rounds of talks in France last year and at the beginning of this year. Due to Hun Sen's stubborn insistence on the conditions proposed by Phnom Penh, the three rounds of talks did not make any progress.

　　西哈努克同洪森会谈    
    双方同意在两个问题上达成某些妥协    
    洪森称为让步将更改“国名”“国旗”“国歌”
    新华社雅加达５月２日电  民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王同金边政权总理洪森今天上午在这里举行第４轮会谈，以寻求解决柬埔寨问题的途径。
    会议于当地时间上午９时开始，３０分钟后，民柬联合政府总理宋双加入了他们的会谈，会谈共进行了两个多小时。据悉，西哈努克亲王、宋双和洪森讨论了越南从柬埔寨撤军、停止外国对柬抵抗力量的援助、国际监督机构监督越南撤军和改换国旗等问题。他们还讨论了国家的宗教、宪法及政党作用等问题。会谈将在今天下午继续举行。
    在今天上午会谈结束后，洪森对记者说，他欢迎西哈努克亲王以国家领导人的身份回到柬埔寨。洪森还说，他和西哈努克亲王将于今年７月２４日在巴黎举行会谈。７月２５日，柬埔寨四方将在巴黎举行会议。
    本报曼谷５月２日电　记者刘爱成报道：今天在雅加达第四轮会谈中，民柬主席西哈努克亲王和金边政权总理洪森表示同意将越南早些时候提出的监督越南撤军的国际监督机构范围加以扩大以及同意在越南全部撤军之后停止外国对柬交战各方的援助。
    西哈努克方面一位发言人今晚通过电话对本报记者说，西哈努克亲王强调，他与洪森在上述两个问题上达成的某些妥协绝不是最后的协议。因为他必须首先与民柬及宋双方面取得一致意见。
    新华社曼谷５月１日电　金边政权总理洪森今天在此间声称，他将在雅加达同民柬主席西哈努克亲王的会谈中做出某些让步。
    洪森所说的让步，是把金边政权的名称从“柬埔寨人民共和国”改为“柬埔寨国”，同时更改金边政权的“国旗”和“国歌”。
    洪森今天在前往雅加达的途中于曼谷停留期间对记者说，他认为这次雅加达会谈十分重要，即使不能全部解决问题，至少也可解决部分问题。
    洪森和西哈努克亲王去年和今年初在法国曾举行３轮会谈。由于洪森顽固坚持金边所提出的条件，３轮会谈均未取得进展。
