Let the People Know the Bottom Line
– Qiaoxi District of Xingtai City Implements Financial Transparency

The Qiaoxi District of Xingtai City in Hebei Province has implemented financial transparency, strengthening grassroots anti-corruption efforts.

Qiaoxi District has 47 administrative villages and 569 collective enterprises at the district, township, and village levels. Previously, financial management at the grassroots level was quite chaotic. Some cadres abused their power, arbitrarily embezzling public property, misappropriating, embezzling, and squandering public funds. The people were very dissatisfied with this. To solve these problems, the Qiaoxi District Committee decided to implement financial transparency throughout the district, allowing the people to supervise financial management. In January, the District Committee issued an open letter titled "Implement Financial Transparency and Proactively Accept Public Supervision" to the entire district, requiring village and enterprise leaders to disclose their financial accounts to village residents or workers' meetings during the Spring Festival, accept public supervision, and establish a system for regular financial disclosure. Subsequently, each township and village established financial audit and rectification teams. These teams first adopted two forms of financial disclosure: public notice or convening a representative assembly of the people. Then, the people evaluated and questioned, and problems were promptly resolved. In one collective enterprise, three responsible persons misappropriated funds for a new project to buy private houses. After being discovered, the Qiaoxi District Committee and the District Government took serious action against these three individuals. In one village, the former party secretary and five others took advantage of the opportunity to manage the liquidation of assets, concealing over 40 million yuan worth of materials. The Qiaoxi District handed them over to the procuratorate for investigation.

These measures have curbed embezzlement, educated a wide range of grassroots cadres, and significantly enhanced their sense of integrity and public service. The deputy party secretary of Beidagou Village voluntarily returned 5,000 yuan in public funds that had been overdue to the village committee. As of now, the entire district has recovered 54.97 million yuan out of 539.26 million yuan in outstanding debts.

　　让群众知道家底
    ——邢台市桥西区实行财务公开
    河北省邢台市桥西区实行财务帐目公开，加强了基层廉政建设。
    桥西区有４７个行政村和５６９个区、乡、村集体企业。以前，基层财务管理相当混乱，有些干部滥用职权，随意鲸吞公共财产，挪用、贪污、挥霍公款。对此，群众非常不满。为解决这些问题，桥西区委决定全区实行财务帐目公开，由群众监督财务管理的制度。今年１月，区委向全区发出一封题为《实行财务公开，主动接受群众监督》的公开信，要求各村和企业领导人在春节期间向村民或职工大会公开财务帐目，接受群众监督，并从此形成制度，定期公布财务帐目。接着各乡、村成立了清查整理财务帐目小组。各小组先采取张榜公布或召开群众代表大会公布两种形式公开财务帐目，然后由群众评议、质询，发现问题及时解决。某集体企业三位负责人挪用筹建新项目款买了私人住房。被查出后，桥西区委和区政府对这三个人进行了严肃处理。某村原支书等五人利用承包清理财产之机，隐瞒４０余万元物资，桥西区把他们送交检察院审查。
    这些做法打击了贪污行为，教育了广大基层干部，使他们的廉政观念和公仆意识大大增强。北大郭村党支部副支书主动交出了长期拖欠村委会的５０００元公款。截至目前，全区共清理出外欠债款５３９．２６万元，现已追回５４．９７万元。
