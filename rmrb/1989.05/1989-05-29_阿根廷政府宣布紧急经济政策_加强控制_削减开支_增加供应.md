Starting from next Monday (May 29), Argentines will face the government's "wartime economic policy." President Alfonsín today announced a series of emergency economic measures.

These emergency measures include government strict control over the unified exchange rate, control over foreign exchange transactions, reduction of government expenditures, strict control over prices, the introduction of new tax items, ensuring the supply of residents' necessities, and increasing relief and subsidies for the unemployed and retirees. Alfonsín also announced that he has decided not to attend the 200th anniversary celebrations of the French Revolution in July.

In the May 14 elections, the opposition party, the Justice Party, won. The chaotic economic situation in Argentina has not improved, and the dollar market continues to fluctuate, driving up prices. President Alfonsín had expressed his willingness to hand over power early, but failed to reach an agreement with the Justice Party. To stabilize the economy, Alfonsín formed a "crisis cabinet" on May 25 to implement "wartime economic policies." Before adopting these emergency economic measures, the government did not reach an agreement with the business community. Although the opposition Justice Party stated that it would not obstruct the government's implementation of emergency economic policies, it has not indicated that it would take a cooperative attitude. Therefore, although the government claims that it will use strict measures to ensure the implementation of the new economic policies, people generally doubt whether the government has the ability to do so in the six months before the handover of power.

　　阿根廷政府宣布紧急经济政策
    加强控制　削减开支　增加供应
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯５月２８日电  从下星期一（２９日）开始，阿根廷人将面对政府制订的“战时经济政策”，阿方辛总统今天宣布了一系列紧急经济政策。
    这些紧急政策包括由政府严格控制统一货币兑换率、控制外汇交易、削减政府开支、严格控制物价、增加新的税收项目、保证居民生活必需品供应、增加对失业者和退休者的救济和补贴。阿方辛还宣布，他决定不去参加今年７月法国革命２００周年纪念活动。
    ５月１４日大选中反对党正义党获胜。处于混乱状态的阿根廷经济形势未见好转，美元市场继续动荡，带动物价飞涨。阿方辛总统曾表示愿意提前交权，但是未能同正义党达成协议。为稳定经济，阿方辛２５日组成“危机内阁”，实施“战时经济政策”。政府在采取紧急经济政策之前，并未与企业界达成协议，反对党正义党虽然表示不阻碍政府实施紧急经济政策，但也没有表明将采取积极合作的态度。因此，尽管政府宣称将以严厉的手段来保证新经济政策的执行，人们对政府在交权前的６个月中，是否有这个能力普遍表示怀疑。
