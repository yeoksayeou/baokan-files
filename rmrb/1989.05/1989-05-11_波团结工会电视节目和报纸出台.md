Poland's Solidarity Union's first special program was broadcast on the second channel of the Polish Central Television on the evening of May 9.

The issue of Solidarity Union having its own special program on the Polish National Television was one of the important topics discussed at the recently concluded "Round Table Conference." Initially, there were differences of opinion between the representatives of Solidarity Union and the government. After negotiations, the "Round Table Conference" decided that the special program for Solidarity Union would be hosted by individuals trusted by both sides.

In addition, the official newspaper of the Polish Solidarity Union, "Gazeta Wyborcza," was officially published in Warsaw on May 8.

"Gazeta Wyborcza" was published with the approval of the Polish authorities, and its current circulation is 150,000 copies.
