Chinese and Soviet chess players competed for the first time in Changchun. The report says that in late April, the fourth-level chess player Chang Jie from the Jilin Province Tianyuan Weiqi Society played against the visiting sixth-level Soviet chess player Sergei. This was the first time Chinese and Soviet Weiqi players have competed in Changchun to exchange chess skills. The result was that Chang Jie won with a five-point advantage.

The friendly match was filled with enthusiasm and warmth from beginning to end. Sergei's tough and tenacious playing style left a deep impression on the Chinese players. After the match, both sides exchanged gifts and expressed their hope to continue and develop exchanges between the Chinese and Soviet Weiqi communities.
