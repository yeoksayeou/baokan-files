China has 250 million smokers, and among them, there are 5 million middle school students! Many people might doubt this, but the facts cannot be denied. If you personally visit the school campuses and ask around, you will find that smoking, this "epidemic," is infiltrating our important stronghold of spiritual civilization—the school campuses—and is harming our future hopes.

Smoking has a big role, and being able to smoke is a necessity of life! In the minds of some middle school students, this idea has already taken root. One middle school student told me that smoking has many benefits. In my investigation, I found that many middle school students smoke out of a desire to imitate others; seeing others smoke seems so cool, so they get excited too. There are also many middle school students who start smoking under the influence of others. One middle school student even said that the biggest benefit of smoking is that it helps maintain psychological balance.

When I explained to the students that smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, they laughed it off. However, the materials released by the World Health Organization are shocking:

Every year, approximately 1 million people worldwide die prematurely due to smoking. By the year 2000, the number of lung cancer patients may reach 2 million.

Regardless of how dry and uninteresting these numbers may seem, let's look at the situation of middle school students who smoke to understand what we should do. Most middle school students who smoke develop delinquent habits! Most of them see a decline in their academic performance! These are not the only problems. Many middle school students, in their pursuit of high-quality smoking experiences, often resort to stealing from home, stealing from society, and even robbing in small alleys. According to investigations, smoking is a major cause of fights and brawls among middle school students. It is no longer a novelty for middle school students to start smoking, make some delinquent friends, and end up in the abyss of crime.

The ways in which middle school students smoke are also unique. They smoke secretly in the classroom when the teacher is not around, or in the restroom when no one is there. However, in movie theaters or on the streets, they smoke openly.

### 中学生烟客达五百万

　　中学生烟客达五百万
    中国有２．５亿烟客，其中居然有５００万是中学生！许多人对此会表示怀疑，然而事实谁也无法否认，只要你亲自到校园走一走，问一问，就会感到吸烟这种“疫病”正潜入我们的精神文明重要阵地——校园，危害着我们未来的希望。
    烟有很大作用，会吸烟是生活的需要！在一些中学生的脑子里已牢牢形成了这种观念。一个中学生告诉我，吸烟的作用表现在多方面。我在调查中发现，许多中学生出于模仿心理，见人家吸烟够洋气的，自己也就来劲了；还有许多中学生是在别人的怂恿下吸的。一位中学生还说吸烟最大好处——能使心理平衡。
    当我向中学生们说明吸烟是导致肺癌的主要原因时，他们一笑置之。但是世界卫生组织宣布的材料是骇人听闻的：
    全世界每年大约有１００万人因吸烟而过早死亡。由于烟害，到２０００年肺癌患者可能达到２００万人。
    且不用说这些枯燥无味的数字与现实的利害程度究竟有多大，但是我们来看一看中学生吸烟后的情况就会知道应该怎么办。中学生吸烟后，染上流氓习气的占大多数！成绩下降的占大多数！这些还不是问题的全部。许多中学生为了追求吸烟的高档化，常常不择手段，往家里偷，往社会上偷，到小街小巷里抢。据调查，吸烟是中学生群架斗殴的一个重要原因。中学生从吸烟开始认识一些流氓朋友而走到犯罪深渊已不再是什么新鲜事了。
    中学生吸烟的方式也很独特。在班级里老师不在时，在厕所里没人时偷偷地吸。在电影院、大街里有人时，却光明正大地吸。
