According to statistics from the National Bureau of Statistics and the Ministry of Light Industry on 63 comparable products, 33 products saw a decline in production in the first quarter. Half of these are essential daily necessities. Among them, aluminum products decreased by 23.5%, light bulbs by 4.5%, iron thermos bottles by 24.9%, and student stationery such as pencil cases and compasses, ping-pong balls, civilian locks, iron pots, scissors, sewing needles, and nail clippers also saw significant declines. With the reduction in the production of small commodities, market supply naturally becomes scarce. According to the Ministry of Commerce, the procurement volume of small commodities in the first quarter generally decreased compared to the same period last year. The decline rates are: pencils 7.5%, iron wire 11.2%, ordinary light bulbs 12.1%, and iron locks 9.6%.

In stark contrast, the production of home appliances and some "high-energy, high-technology, high-consumption" products continued to surge in the first quarter. Air conditioners and vacuum cleaners both saw a more than twofold increase compared to the same period last year. There are now over a hundred factories producing vacuum cleaners, with an annual output of 1.8 million units; the number of microwave oven manufacturers has also grown to over 40, and there are more than 200 electric stoves. The market for electric fans, washing machines, and refrigerators has begun to accumulate inventory, but the production in the first quarter still increased by 30.8%, 31.9%, and 49.1% respectively.

The main reasons for this situation are that after the fiscal decentralization, many places prioritize tax revenue targets. Economic management departments, enterprises, and contract holders are often influenced by economic interests. "High-energy, high-technology, high-consumption" products have high profits and taxes, making them a priority for development. However, the relevant departments lack effective control measures, and policies and economic tools are not coordinated, making it difficult to control the situation. Small commodities have low profits, making production unprofitable or even loss-making, so enterprises are reluctant to produce them, and local governments are unwilling to develop them. Essential materials and energy like steel are also not guaranteed. For example, in Xi'an, energy is preferentially supplied to large restaurants rather than thermos bottle factories. At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Light Industry proposed a double-inclination policy for essential daily necessities, but the actual implementation results show that what needs to be suppressed cannot be suppressed, and what needs to be promoted cannot be promoted. Adjusting the structure of light industrial products and ensuring effective market supply urgently need national support and local backing.

### 该下不下　该保未保  轻工产品结构调整遇阻

　　该下不下　该保未保
    轻工产品结构调整遇阻
    本报讯  记者毕月华报道：据国家统计局和轻工业部对６３种可比产品统计，第一季度生产下降的３３种产品中，有半数是生活必需的小商品。其中，精铝制品下降２３．５％，灯泡下降４．５％，铁壳保温瓶下降２４．９％，学生用的文具盒和圆规、乒乓球、民用锁、铁锅、剪刀、缝衣针、指甲剪也大幅度下降。小商品生产少了，市场供给自然短缺。据商业部统计，一季度小商品的收购量普遍比去年同期有所下降。下降幅度为：铅笔７．５％、铁丝１１．２％、普通灯泡１２．１％、铁锁９．６％。
    与此形成鲜明对比的是，家电产品与一些“三高”产品，第一季度产量继续大幅度上升。空调器和吸尘器分别比去年同期增长２倍多。生产吸尘器的厂家已超过百家，年产量达１８０万台；微波炉厂家也发展到４０多家，电磁灶已超过２００家。电风扇、洗衣机市场已开始积压，冰箱已由畅销转为平销，但一季度产量仍分别增长３０．８％、３１．９％、４９．１％。
    造成上述状况的主要原因是，财政分灶吃饭后，许多地方都把利税指标放在首位，经济管理部门、企业及承包人多为经济利益所左右。“三高”产品利大税高，被置于优先发展位置，而有关部门调控手段薄弱，加上政策和经济手段不配套，无力控制局面。小商品利微，生产无利可图甚至亏本，企业不愿生产，地方不愿发展，所需钢材等原材料和能源均无保障。像西安等地，宁愿把能源供给大饭馆，而不供给保温瓶厂。今年初，轻工业部提出对生活必需品实行双重倾斜政策，实际执行结果，该压的压不下，该上的上不了。调整轻工产品结构，保障市场有效供给，亟需国家扶持、地方支持。
