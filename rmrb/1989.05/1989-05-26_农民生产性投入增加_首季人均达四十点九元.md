Farmers Increase Productive Investment, Reaching 40.9 Yuan Per Capita in the First Quarter

Due to the effective measures taken by governments at all levels to "warm up" agriculture, farmers' enthusiasm for production has begun to recover. Data shows that farmers' investment in production in the first quarter has increased significantly compared to the same period last year, and the input of physical resources such as fertilizers and pesticides has also shown signs of recovery.

According to the latest sample survey by the Rural Survey Team of the National Bureau of Statistics, farmers' per capita investment in production in the first quarter of this year reached 40.9 yuan, an increase of 28.3% compared to the same period last year. Even after accounting for price increases, there was still a 2.4% increase. Compared to the same period last year, the average amount of several major production materials purchased by farmers per household in the first quarter was: 101.6 kilograms of fertilizer, an increase of 4.7%; 1.4 kilograms of pesticides, an increase of 5 times; and 0.45 kilograms of agricultural plastic film, an increase of 18.4%. Farmers not only focus on short-term investments but also pay attention to strengthening the long-term potential of agriculture.

In contrast to the increase in production investment, the growth rate of farmers' living consumption expenditures in the first quarter has slowed down. In the first quarter of 1988, farmers' monetary living consumption expenditures increased by 23% compared to the same period in 1987. This year, the situation has improved. Farmers' per capita living consumption expenditure was 112.5 yuan, an increase of 23.9% compared to the same period last year. However, after accounting for price increases, the actual expenditure decreased by 3.4%.

　　农民生产性投入增加
    首季人均达四十点九元
    新华社北京５月２６日电  （记者蒲立业）由于各级政府采取了一系列为农业“升温”的有效措施，使我国农民发展生产的积极性开始恢复。有资料显示，首季农民生产投资比去年同期明显增多，化肥、农药等实物投入也开始出现回升的势头。
    据国家统计局农村调查总队最新抽样调查，今年一季度农民人均生产投资达４０．９元，比去年同期增长２８．３％，扣除物价上涨因素，仍增长２．４％。与去年同期相比，首季农民平均每户购买的几种主要生产资料：化肥１０１．６公斤，增长４．７％；农药１．４公斤，增长５倍；农用薄膜０．４５公斤，增长１８．４％。农民不仅注重短期投入，而且还注意增强农业后劲。
    与生产投入增多形成鲜明对比的是，今年一季度农民生活消费支出增长速度已趋向缓慢。１９８８年一季度农民生活消费货币支出比１９８７年同期增长２３％；今年一季度情况则有所改观，农民人均生活消费额１１２．５元，比去年同期增长２３．９％，扣除物价上涨因素，实际减少３．４％。
