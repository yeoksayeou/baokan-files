Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 14th.

Recent information from the National Biotechnology Strategic Goals Conference held in Shanghai indicates that, amidst fierce global competition in the field of advanced biotechnology, Chinese scientists have achieved significant progress in three areas after more than a year of hard work.

In the realm of basic biotechnology research, China has mastered over 20 cutting-edge projects recognized internationally, including peptide sequencing, DNA synthesis, and gene amplification. The country also possesses the necessary advanced biotechnology instruments.

In agricultural biotechnology research, China's hybrid rice research is leading the world. The two-line hybrid rice, originally planned for production in 1990, was successfully developed by the end of last year. Field trials covering nearly a thousand acres have been conducted, and this year, the trials will be expanded to 10,000 acres. This new variety can increase yield by 50 to 70 kilograms per acre compared to three-line hybrid rice. If this variety is promoted over 100 million acres, it is estimated that it could increase annual rice production by 8.5 billion kilograms.

In the field of medical biotechnology, China has the capability to develop the majority of the over 80 new biotechnology-based pharmaceutical products currently being developed by advanced countries. China has already developed vaccines derived from the blood plasma of infected individuals to control the spread of hepatitis B. Recently, significant progress has been made in the development of new hepatitis B vaccines and multivalent vaccines. Three single-dose live vaccine strains, including hepatitis B, are expected to complete identification and human trials this year. By the end of next year, the existing hepatitis B gene-engineered vaccine is expected to complete intermediate trials and enter production.

　　我生物尖端技术研究获重大成就    
    二十多个基础研究尖端项目有能力全部掌握    
    能够开发八十多种国外新生物技术医药产品
    新华社上海５月１４日电（记者张学全）最近在此间结束的全国生物领域战略目标会议透出信息：在世界各国竞争激烈的生物尖端技术领域，我国科学家经过一年多的拚搏，已在三个方面取得重大成就。
    在生物技术基础研究方面，多肽测序、ＤＮＡ合成、基因扩增等２０多项被国际认为生物尖端技术的项目，我国都有能力全部掌握；应有的尖端生物仪器也已具备。
    在农业生物技术研究方面，杂交水稻的研究已处于世界领先地位。原定１９９０年投产的两系法品种间杂交稻，已于去年底突破，中间试验近千亩，今年内可扩大到１万亩。这种新品可比三系法杂交水稻每亩增产５０至７０公斤。如推广１亿亩，预计年增产稻谷可达８５亿公斤。
    在医药生物技术方面，目前世界发达国家开发的８０多种新生物技术医药产品中，我国绝大部分有能力进行开发。我国已能制备从带病毒者血浆中分离加工制成的血源性疫苗，用于控制乙型肝炎传播。最近新型乙肝疫苗和多价疫苗项目又获显著成绩。包括乙肝在内的三种单价人用活疫苗株，有的将在今年内完成鉴定，并进行人体实验观察。预计到明年底，现有的乙肝基因工程疫苗将完成中间试验，并可投入生产。
