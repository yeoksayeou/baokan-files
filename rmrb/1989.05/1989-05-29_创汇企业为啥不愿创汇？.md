	Recently, the author visited several export-oriented enterprises in Qin Yang County, Henan Province. From the managers of these enterprises, it was learned that many enterprises capable of earning foreign exchange prefer to engage in "domestic trade" rather than export their products. Although these enterprises also undertake some export tasks, it is mainly to strive for excellence. Out of the 11 enterprises surveyed, 9 indicated they were not willing to export their products. What is the reason for this?

	— The price for domestic sales is high, while the price for foreign trade is low, making exports less profitable than domestic sales. Out of the 11 enterprises, 9 reported that the price for their products sold to foreign trade is lower than the price for domestic sales. The manager of the Bai Xiang Oil Factory said: Our produced soybean meal and peanut meal are in high demand domestically at 1,300 yuan per ton. However, when we hand over the products to the foreign trade department for export, we only receive 1,200 yuan per ton (including foreign exchange), resulting in a loss of 100 yuan per ton.

	— Low transparency in foreign trade. When enterprises hand over their products to the foreign trade department for export, they cannot know the price offered by foreign buyers, and sometimes they cannot even accurately know where their products are sold. The managers of the export-oriented enterprises liken this situation to "buying a cat in a sack."

	— Blocked channels and lack of supporting services. The Yu Zhu Ye Wine Factory reported that their "Qing Gong Wine" is highly favored by foreign buyers. At the China Health Beverage and Wine Exhibition held in Shenzhen in May 1985, businessmen from Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Hong Kong collectively ordered 2 million boxes. However, by the end of last year, only 200,000 boxes had been exported. The main reasons are twofold: first, the channels are blocked, and after the Shenzhen exhibition, there has been no opportunity to contact foreign buyers, making it difficult to finalize the specifics of the export; second, foreign buyers have different requirements for export packaging, and it is difficult to obtain the necessary packaging paper, bottles, and bottle caps domestically, while importing from abroad is fraught with difficulties.

	— Low foreign exchange retention, slow fulfillment of quotas, and difficulties in using foreign exchange. The foreign exchange retention ratio stipulated by the foreign trade department is 12.5%, which is much lower than in some coastal regions. The fulfillment of quotas requires half a year or even longer. Foreign exchange retention has a quota, but enterprises cannot use it to purchase goods or import necessary equipment, which requires three approvals and two reports. Therefore, many foreign exchange-earning enterprises find it difficult to use the quota and have to "sell" it.

　　创汇企业为啥不愿创汇？
    魏万结
    最近笔者走访了河南省沁阳县部分外向型企业，从这些企业的厂长们那儿得知：不少有创汇能力的企业宁愿搞“内贸”，也不愿产品出口。尽管这些企业也应付一些出口任务，那也是为了争创名优。１１个被调查的企业中，有９个企业反映不乐意产品出口。这是什么原因呢？
    ——内销价格高、外贸价格低，出口不如内销。这１１个企业中，有９个企业反映他们的产品卖给外贸比内销价格低。柏香油厂的厂长说：我们生产的黄豆粕、花生粕内销每吨１３００元供不应求。但把产品交给外贸部门出口，我们每吨只得１２００元（含外汇），这样１吨就少挣１００元。
    ——外贸透明度低。企业把产品交给外贸部门出口，企业无法知道他们的产品外商给什么价，有时就连他们的产品销售的地方也很难准确知道。创汇企业的厂长们把这种现象比做“隔布袋买猫”。
    ——渠道不畅、服务不配套。玉竹叶酒厂反映，他们生产的“清宫酒”很受外商青睐。１９８５年５月在深圳举办的中国保健酒饮料酒展销会上，新加坡、马来西亚、泰国、香港商人共订购２００万箱，然而直到去年年底才出口２万箱。主要原因有二：一是渠道不畅，深圳一别后再没有机会和外商接触，难以商定出口的具体事宜；二是外商对出口包装的要求各不相同，清宫酒出口需要的包装纸、瓶及瓶塞等在国内很难解决，从国外引进又困难重重。
    ——外汇留成少，指标兑现慢，用汇难。外贸部门规定的创汇留成比例为１２．５％，比一些沿海地区低得多，指标兑现需要半年或更长时间。外汇留成有额度，但企业却不可以拿来购买商品，引进必要设备也得三请示两报告。因此，不少创汇企业有“额”难用，只好把额度“卖掉”。
