Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 14th.

Today at around 4 PM, leaders from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and relevant departments, including Li Tieying, Yan Mingfu, and Wei Jianxing, held a dialogue with representatives from over 30 universities in Beijing. Students who were on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square also sent representatives. The dialogue took place at the conference hall of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Yan Mingfu presided over the dialogue. He first introduced the preparation process for this dialogue. He said that the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed to establish a regular consultation and dialogue mechanism. We have established a dialogue system with democratic parties and non-party personnel, but we have not yet established a regular dialogue mechanism with students. This time, students proposed the demand for dialogue, and the Party and the government attach great importance to it. Since we are having a dialogue, it should not be perfunctory or merely to satisfy students temporarily. This is not conducive to solving problems, does not help the reform process, and is also irresponsible to students. Today's dialogue should be conducted sincerely. I hope this will be a good start. In the future, we will establish multi-level dialogue channels widely. Of course, dialogue can only be a channel for exchanging views, communicating information, and increasing transparency. Some deep-seated contradictions in society cannot be solved just by dialogue; it also requires practical work and everyone's joint efforts. Li Tieying emphasized in his speech that a regular dialogue mechanism should be established with teachers, students, and staff in the education sector.

The representatives of Beijing's university students spoke, stating that it was not easy to secure this dialogue opportunity. They hoped to discuss three aspects: first, how to evaluate this student movement; second, how to guarantee the civil rights stipulated in Article 35 of the Constitution; and third, how to promote China's reform.

Today's dialogue mainly focused on the first issue. Both sides presented their views, but no consensus was reached. When the dialogue was about to end at around 7 PM, representatives of the students on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square came to the dialogue venue and requested live broadcasting of the dialogue. The host pointed out that the technical conditions could not meet this requirement. The student representatives also had different opinions on how to continue the dialogue, so it was announced that the dialogue would be adjourned.

　　李铁映阎明复等与大学生对话    
    双方阐述各自观点但尚未取得一致     
    阎明复希望坦诚对话成为良好开端
    本报北京５月１４日讯  今天下午４时许，中共中央、国务院和有关部门领导李铁映、阎明复、尉健行等与首都３０多所高校学生推举出的对话代表对话，在天安门广场绝食的同学也派代表参加。对话在中共中央统战部机关礼堂进行。
    阎明复主持对话会。他首先介绍了这次对话的准备过程。他说，党的十三大提出，应建立经常性的协商对话渠道，我们同民主党派、非党人士建立了对话制度，与同学们还没有建立起经常性的对话渠道。这次，同学们提出对话要求，党和政府是很重视的，既然对话，就不应是敷衍的、应付的，使同学们一时满意，这样不利于问题的解决，无助于改革的进程，也是对同学们不负责任的。今天的对话应该坦诚地进行，希望这是个良好的开端。从今后，把多层次的对话渠道广泛地建立起来。当然，对话只能是交换意见、沟通信息、增加透明度的渠道，社会上一些深层的矛盾，不是光靠对话就能解决的，还要靠实际工作，靠大家的共同努力。李铁映讲话强调，要和教育界的老师、同学、职工建立经常的对话制度。
    首都高校学生对话代表在发言中提出，我们争取到这次对话机会很不容易，希望在三个方面进行对话。一是怎样评价这次学运；二是怎样保证宪法第３５条规定的公民权利；三是如何推进中国的改革。
    今天的对话主要围绕第一个问题进行。双方阐述了各自的观点，尚未取得一致意见。当对话进行到晚７时许，在天安门广场绝食的学生代表来到对话会场，提出要求现场直播这次对话，主持人指出技术设备条件无法解决，学生代表对对话如何继续也有不同意见，于是宣布休会。（附图片）
