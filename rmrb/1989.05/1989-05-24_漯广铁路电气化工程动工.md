The electrification project of the Luoguo section of the Jingguang Railway began construction yesterday. This segment, which is part of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key projects, spans 227 kilometers from Luohe in Henan Province to Guangshui in Hubei Province.

In recent years, with the completion of the Hengyang-Guangzhou line, the section from Zhengzhou North Station to Wuchang South Station, including Luohe to Guangshui, has become a bottleneck on the Jingguang Railway. To enhance the railway's transportation capacity, the state is utilizing foreign funds to electrify this section. The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of next year.

    漯广铁路电气化工程动工
    新华社郑州5月24日电  （通讯员倪树斌）国家“七五”计划重点建设项目——京广线漯河至广水段铁路电气化工程昨天动工兴建。
    这段铁路全长227公里，由北向南横贯河南、湖北两省。近年来随着衡广复线通车，使包括漯（河）广（水）在内的郑州北站至武昌南站这段铁路，已成为京广线的“卡脖子”区段。为了提高铁路运输能力，国家利用外资对这段铁路进行电气化改造，计划明年年底前建成。
