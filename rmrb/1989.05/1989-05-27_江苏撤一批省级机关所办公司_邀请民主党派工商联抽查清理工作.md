　　江苏撤一批省级机关所办公司
    邀请民主党派工商联抽查清理工作
    新华社南京５月２７日电  江苏省委、省政府清理整顿公司领导小组最近决定，撤销２０个省级机关开办的公司。
    这些公司都是省委、省政府各部、委、办、厅、局开办的。５月１６日，省工商行政管理局已向有关单位发出通知，立即停止这些公司的经营活动。
    江苏省委、省政府清理整顿公司领导小组新近还决定，邀请省民革、民盟、民建、民进、九三学社、工商联等，同省委、省政府有关部门一起，对省直机关和各市清理公司工作进行抽查。抽查的重点是：按规定该撤销的公司撤了没有？该与党政机关脱钩的公司脱钩了没有？党政机关干部包括离退休干部从公司退出了没有？公司的违法经营案件查处了没有？凡是清理整顿不认真、不彻底的，要坚决按中央、国务院有关文件规定进行补课。
