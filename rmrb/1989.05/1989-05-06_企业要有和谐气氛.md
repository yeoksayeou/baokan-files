As the director of Shenyang First Machine Tool Factory for over four years, my primary concern has been how to effectively manage the enterprise. Should the director issue orders, or should we guide the masses to self-discipline? I believe that we must fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, inspire their awareness of participating in management, support their active participation, and create a harmonious and relaxed environment.

Once, I initiated a campaign for rationalization suggestions across the entire factory. As soon as the notice was issued, I received a letter from Bo Dongbin, a planning section worker from the 25th workshop. In the letter, he offered his opinions on four aspects: ideological education, labor discipline, canteen management, and strengthening the management of tooling manufacturing. I read this letter twice and was deeply moved. It contained both constructive criticism and positive suggestions, reflecting his love for the factory and his concern for existing problems. Our factory has a bulletin, and I published this letter on the front page. The factory not only propagated and praised Bo Dongbin's sense of ownership but also adopted his suggestions regarding labor discipline and canteen management.

The fact that ordinary workers' opinions are valued by the factory is a great encouragement for all workers to participate in management. Everyone is willing to offer suggestions for the factory's management. As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work." Currently, the factory has formulated 236 management standards and 874 work standards from the bottom up, making all work in the factory orderly.

For any enterprise, regardless of size, the most fashionable slogan is to seek benefits through management. However, putting this slogan into practice is the ultimate goal of management. Our factory's C6140 ordinary lathe is a nationally recognized product, with an annual production of around 6,000 units, covering 13.3% of the national lathe market. It has always created high profits for the factory. However, the workers never forget to innovate and create excellence through technological progress. Engineer Teng Libo analyzed its functions, conducted in-depth research, and repeatedly experimented to find the best way to achieve necessary functions with the least cost. Through value engineering analysis of the main components of the main shaft system, he changed the original three-bearing main shaft to a two-bearing design. As a result, the machine's vibration was reduced, rigidity was improved, the external failure rate was reduced by 3%, and the product cost was reduced by 236.82 yuan per unit, saving the factory 1.421 million yuan in production costs annually. Since then, I have firmly believed that as long as we mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, encourage them to think and find ways, the enterprise's benefits will surely increase.

专栏：厂长经理谈管理

　　企业要有和谐气氛
    沈阳第一机床厂厂长  黄铭亮
    我担任沈阳第一机床厂厂长４年多，考虑最多的就是如何搞好企业的管理问题。是厂长发号施令呢，还是引导群众自觉约束自己？我认为，要充分调动广大职工群众的积极性，焕发他们参与管理的意识，支持他们参与管理的积极行动，创造一种和谐的气氛和宽松的环境。
    一次，我在全厂开展合理化建议活动。通知刚一发出，就收到了２５号车间工段计划员董维斌同志写给我的一封信。信中从思想教育、劳动纪律、食堂管理、加强工装制造管理４个方面提出了自己的看法。这封信我反复看了两遍，很受感动。信中既有中肯的批评，又有积极的建议，看得出他对工厂的热爱和对存在问题的焦虑。我们办有厂报，我将这封信刊登在厂报的头版头条。厂里不仅仅宣传、赞扬董维斌的主人翁精神，还采纳了他有关劳动纪律、食堂管理方面的建议。
    普通职工的意见受到厂里的重视，对全厂职工参与管理是个很大的鼓励，大家乐意为工厂的管理献计献策。俗话说，众人拾柴火焰高。目前，全厂已自下而上制定出了２３６个管理标准，８７４个工作标准，工厂的各项工作都有章有序。
    但凡企业，无论大小，都以向管理要效益做为最时髦的口号。其实，把这个口号付诸于实践才是经营者的目的。我们厂的ＣＡ６１４０普通车床是国优产品，年产量６０００台左右，在全国车床市场上的覆盖率达到了１３．３％，每年都给工厂创造了较高的利润。但是职工们还是不忘从技术进步上再创优。工程师滕立波通过对其功能的分析，潜心研究，反复实验，寻找如何用最少的成本去实现产品必要功能的最佳途径，通过对主轴系统各主要零件的价值工程分析，将原来主轴三支承改为二支承，结果机床震动减小了，钢性提高了，外部故障率减少了３％，产品成本每台降低了２３６．８２元，全年可为工厂节约生产成本１４２．１万元。打这以后，我坚信，只要把广大职工群众的积极性调动起来，让他们动脑筋，想办法，企业的效益准会提高。
