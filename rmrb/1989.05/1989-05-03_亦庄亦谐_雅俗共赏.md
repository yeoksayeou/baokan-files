The Shandong Luju Opera Troupe, which once captivated the nation with "Li Er Sao Changes Husband," returned to the Beijing stage after a decade-long absence. Their new play, "Drawing the Dragon's Eyes," showcased their former glory and won the hearts of the capital's audience.

This is a newly adapted historical drama that tells the story of Tang Taizong Li Shimin and the supervising censor Ma Zhou. According to the "New Book of Tang," Ma Zhou was orphaned at a young age and came from a poor family. He was fond of learning, skilled in poetry, and had a broad vision. However, his fellow villagers considered him careless and looked down on him. Later, he was recognized by Li Shimin and rose to prominence. As a feudal official, Ma Zhou had keen insights. He saw that in the early years of the Zhenguan era, after the wars had subsided, the people were burdened with heavy labor. "Brothers went out, and younger brothers returned, traveling thousands of miles, with no rest in spring, autumn, winter, or summer." He proposed that "the country is based on people, and it is necessary to make the people happy." Therefore, the ruler should "be frugal in personal matters and generous to people"; he also saw that at the time, corrupt officials were rampant in the countryside, and proposed that "the way to govern is to seek talented people and appoint officials carefully." "Seeking talented people" requires keen eyes to recognize talents; "appointing officials" requires thorough checks and strict governance. The playwrights keenly unearthed the historical philosophy that shines with the light of the times from the historical records and created a thought-provoking play.

For an excellent historical drama, the theme and depth are certainly important, but what is even more important is the creation of characters and the development of the plot. This is the body that the soul of the drama relies on to exist and the focus of the audience's aesthetic appreciation. Ma Zhou is the main character that the playwrights cherish. Through the plot where the general of the left guard, Chang He, submits a memorial on state governance strategies, but the dragon lacks eyes; and his encounter with Li Shimin, who is in disguise to seek talents, leading to "surprising the emperor"; his refusal to be coerced by the corrupt official Zhao Yuanqing and later his refusal to be tempted by him; and his unwavering love for Si Niang, whom he had not seen for fifteen years, the play depicts his extensive knowledge, uninhibited nature, concern for the country and its people, and his righteous and loyal character from different angles.

Li Shimin, this rare wise ruler in our history, is not only praised by historians but also frequently seen on the stage. However, "Drawing the Dragon's Eyes" has its unique portrayal of him. The play writes about how he discovers a talent through the memorial submitted by the general of the left guard, Chang He, and goes in disguise to seek talents. On the way, he is extorted by the county magistrate Zhao Yuanqing, losing his jade pendant, horse, and clothes, and ends up fleeing in the middle of the night, hungry and penniless. He personally experiences the suffering of the oppressed, realizing the urgency of rectifying officialdom. The corrupt official Zhao Yuanqing is a comic figure created by the playwrights. In front of the common people, he has no regard for the law and is arrogant; towards his superiors, he curries favor and flatteries. He treats the humble scholar Ma Zhou with slight dissatisfaction and "expels him from the territory," but as soon as he hears that Ma Zhou has been noticed by the emperor, he immediately fawns and flatteries, marrying off his daughter to form a connection with the nobility, and even embezzles from imperial edicts! He extorts from Li Shimin, who is in disguise, in every possible way, but as soon as the truth is revealed, he is frightened to death and dies instantly. The ugly image of a despicable and corrupt official is vividly portrayed to the audience. Moreover, the play cleverly reveals the nepotism and corruption of the feudal bureaucracy through Zhao Yuanqing's confession: "The prefect is my mentor, the governor is my brother-in-law, officials are all the same, you can't report me!"

The entire play begins with Ma Zhou drawing the dragon and ends with Si Niang shedding blood to "draw the eyes," with a neat and intricate structure.

This is a serious play with a strong sense of life and a comic style, both serious and humorous, refined and popular. For Luju Opera, which excels in portraying family ethics and love stories between men and women, this is undoubtedly a breakthrough, embodying the aesthetic pursuit of Chinese opera and contemporary consciousness.

　　亦庄亦谐　雅俗共赏
    王蕴明
    曾以《李二嫂改嫁》风靡全国的山东省吕剧团，在阔别十年之后，最近重返首都剧坛，一出《画龙点睛》，再现当年风采，赢得首都观众的喜爱。
    这是一出新编历史剧，讲的是唐太宗李世民与监察御史马周的故事。据《新唐书》载：马周“少孤，家窭狭。嗜学，善诗、春秋。资旷迈，乡人以无细谨，薄之。”后为李世民赏识而显达。作为一位封建臣僚，马周颇具卓见。他鉴于战乱方弭的贞观初年，人民“徭役相望，兄去弟还，往来远者五、六千里，春秋冬夏略无休时”的沉重负担，提出“天下者以人为本，必也使百姓安乐”。因此，为人主者“要节俭于身，恩加于人”；又鉴于当时贪官污吏横行乡里，提出“致化之道在于求贤审官”。“求贤”者必具敏锐目光，方能慧眼识英才；“审官”者，要在复核稽查，整饬吏治。剧作家敏锐地由史料中发掘出闪烁着时代辉光的历史哲理，敷衍出一部发人深省的活剧。
    对于一部优秀的历史剧，立意和开掘固然重要，而更为重要的在于人物的塑造与情节的铺陈，这是剧作灵魂赖以生存的躯体，是观众的审美所在。马周是剧作家所钟爱的主要人物，剧中通过代中郎将常何上书治国方略，画无睛苍龙；与微服访贤的李世民邂逅相遇而“惊驾”；始不为贪官赵元楷所屈、后不为其所诱；与失散十五年的四娘的不渝情爱等，从不同的侧面刻画了他满腹经纶、落拓不羁、忧国忧民、侠骨丹心的品格与情愫。李世民这位我国历史上少有的明君，不仅为史家所称道，也屡见于戏剧舞台。而《画龙点睛》对他的刻画有其独到之处。剧中写他由代中郎将常何所上的条陈而发现奇才，为求奇才而微服私访；途中遭县官赵元楷敲诈勒索，玉珮、马匹、衣服被劫，以至落荒夜半，饥肠辘辘，不名分文，亲身体验了一下被压迫者的滋味，省悟到整饬吏治，刻不容缓。贪官赵元楷是剧作家创造的一个被鞭打的喜剧人物。他在平民面前，目无法纪，飞扬跋扈；对上则攀附权贵、拍马钻营。他对待一介寒儒的马周，稍有不满，便“驱逐出境”，而一旦闻知他被皇帝看中，便即刻谄媚逢迎、嫁女联姻，从此高攀连贵胄，圣旨过手也揩油！对微服私访的李世民百般敲诈勒索，而一旦真相大白，即刻惊吓得魂飞魄散，一命呜呼。一个可憎可鄙的贪官污吏的丑恶形象活画于观众面前。而且剧中巧妙地通过赵元楷的自白“府尹是我恩师，太守是我妻侄，当官的一个样儿，怕你告不倒！”生动而深刻地揭露了封建吏治的裙带关系与官场的腐败。全剧由马周挥毫“画龙”始，到四娘洒血“点睛”止，首尾相应，结构严谨而玲珑。
    这是一出具有浓郁生活气息与喜剧风格的正剧，亦庄亦谐，雅俗共赏。这对于擅长于表现家庭伦理道德、男欢女爱的吕剧来说，无疑是一种超越，体现了中国戏曲的审美追求与当代意识。
