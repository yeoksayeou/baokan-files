After 10 years of rapid development, China's international tourism industry is at a crossroads.

On one hand, it is inspired by the glorious achievements of the past 10 years, but on the other hand, it is puzzled by the problems brought by the continuous high-speed growth of overseas tourists. The imbalance between the tourism industry and transportation capacity is becoming increasingly apparent. Overloading causes traffic congestion, which has become one of the most prominent problems at present. The rapid expansion of tourism enterprises and guide teams has led to poor service quality, which cannot but affect China's reputation in the international tourism market.

This has led to a debate within the tourism industry: whether to maintain a certain development speed or to slow down temporarily. Maintaining speed makes it difficult to operate and damages reputation; slowing down, what about the 1,500 tourism hotels that have already been built? The tourism industry is facing a major choice.

Pursue numbers? Pursue benefits?

What is the indicator for the continued development of the tourism industry? Is it the growth of the number of tourists?

Spain, known as the "Tourism Kingdom," has seen its annual tourist reception numbers increase from 40 million to 50 million in recent years. Last year, it reached 54 million. While celebrating the continued status as the world's largest tourist-receiving country, Spain has cooled down and decided that in the future, the number of tourists received each year will not exceed 50 million; no new hotels will be built; the development direction of the tourism industry will be to continuously improve the reception quality and increase the average consumption per tourist per day.

Spain's change in concept means that the world tourism industry is shifting from shallow development to deep development. This will inevitably cause deep reflection among the macro-management departments and decision-makers of the tourism industry in various countries around the world.

China's tourist reception number is 40 million per year, far from the ceiling. The tourism industry needs to continue to develop, but the concept and direction of development should be inspired by Spain's trend. Especially under the current conditions of being greatly constrained by transportation, it should shift from the first position of receiving the number of tourists to the first position of receiving quality. It is not advisable to seek benefits and development from the number of tourists but from the average consumption per tourist per day.

From the current composition of China's tourism foreign exchange income, the two major areas of shopping and evening entertainment for tourists still have great potential for earning foreign exchange. Currently, the proportion of tourism shopping foreign exchange income in China is only about 30% of the total income and is showing a slow downward trend. Last year, Beijing dropped to 16.2%. In some countries around the world, this proportion is 40-50%. In "shopping paradises" like Hong Kong and Singapore, it can even reach 60% or more.

China has abundant tourism commodity resources, but the finished products sold in various places are largely the same, lacking characteristics. Many overseas tourists come with money but cannot spend it and complain. Last year, China's tourism foreign exchange income was $2.22 billion, receiving 4.3 million organized overseas tourists. If the proportion of selling tourism commodities is increased by 5 percentage points, $110 million can be earned, equivalent to receiving 215,000 more tourists.

The evening entertainment life of tourists, except for a few cities like Guangzhou that have started to become active, is basically "temple viewing during the day and sleeping at night" in most places. In some places, there is not even an item for evening entertainment foreign exchange income. If we can study and develop various cultural and entertainment projects that are rich in Chinese national characteristics, healthy, and popular and participatory for overseas tourists, we can not only increase the attractiveness of traveling to China but also increase income. Why not do it?

Reputation important? Money important?

Another indicator of the deep development of the tourism industry is to win a shining reputation with all-around high-quality service. When income and reputation conflict, it is better to temporarily bear the pain of giving up immediate income to ensure that reputation is not damaged.

In 1987, Thailand held the "Tourism Year," receiving 3.4 million foreign tourists, a 20% increase from 1986. The decision-makers of Thailand's tourism industry, which was booming, did not get carried away. After fully weighing the pros and cons, they reduced the growth target for 1988 to 10% and then to 8% six months later. They believed that although everything is going smoothly at present, if tourists are allowed to surge in like a tide, the consequences of full hotels, tense transportation, and declining guide quality will be unavoidable. Rather than damaging the reputation of the tourism industry due to blind development, it is better to control the gate early to ensure the sustainable and stable development of the tourism industry.

Thailand's wise decision reminds us: the development speed of the tourism industry is not the faster the better, and tourists are not the more the better under any conditions; the development speed of tourism has an optimal value, and exceeding this "value" will inevitably have consequences.

As for the problem of "what to do with 1,500 tourism hotels," it should also be weighed on the scale of reputation gains and losses. If the heavy price of further damaging reputation is paid to forcefully fill the stomach of the hotels, the false appearance of "hotel shortage" will continue, resulting in a vicious cycle.

　　旅游业如何继续发展
    戴巴冠
    经过１０年快马加鞭的发展，中国国际旅游业正走到十字路口。
    一方面为１０年的辉煌成就所鼓舞，另方面又为海外旅游者持续高速增长带来的难题所困惑。旅游业与交通运力的失衡倾斜日益显露，超负荷运转造成交通梗阻，已成为当前最突出的问题之一；旅游企业和导游队伍迅速膨胀，服务质量不佳。这不能不影响我在国际旅游市场的声誉。
    由此而引起了旅游业是继续保持一定发展速度，还是暂时减速之争。保速，日子难过，声誉受损；减速，已建成的１５００家旅游饭店怎么办？旅游业正面临重大抉择。
    追求人数？追求效益？
    旅游业要继续发展，标志是什么？第一位的是旅游人数的增长吗？
    号称“旅游王国”的西班牙，近几年每年接待旅游人数从４０００万逐渐增长到５０００万。去年，达到５４００万人。在庆祝继续保持世界第一接待大国地位的时候，西班牙冷静下来了，决定今后每年接待游客至多５０００万；不再建新饭店；旅游业的发展方向将是不断提高接待质量和提高游客的人天平均消费量。
    西班牙这一观念的转变，意味着世界旅游业开始由浅层发展趋向深层发展。这必将引起世界各国旅游业宏观管理部门和决策层的深刻思考。
    我国旅游接待人数一年４００多万，离封顶尚远。旅游业要继续发展，但发展的观念和方向应从西班牙的动向中得到启发。尤其在目前受交通条件极大牵制的情况下，应由接待人数第一转变为接待质量第一。不宜从人数而要从游客人天平均消费量上求效益，求发展。
    从目前我国旅游外汇收入构成看，游客的购物和晚间文娱生活这两大块尚有很大的创汇潜力。现在全国旅游购物外汇收入只占总收入的３０％左右，且呈缓慢下降的趋势。去年北京市已降至１６．２％。而世界上一些国家则占总收入的４０—５０％。香港、新加坡这些“购物天堂”，有时甚至高达６０％以上。
    我国旅游商品资源非常丰富，但各地销售的制成品却是大同小异，缺乏特色。许多海外游客带了钱来因花不出去而抱怨。去年我国旅游外汇收入２２．２亿美元，接待有组织的海外旅游者４３０万人，如果把销售旅游商品收入比例提高５个百分点，即可增收１．１亿美元，相当于多接待２１．５万名游客。
    旅游者的晚间文娱生活，除了广州等少数城市开始活跃起来之外，多数地方基本是“白天看庙，晚上睡觉”，有的地方甚至还没有晚间文娱外汇收入这一项。如果我们能研究和开发富有中国民族特色的、健康的、为海外游客喜闻乐见和乐于参与的各种文化娱乐项目，既可增加来华旅游的吸引力，又可增加收入，何乐而不为呢。
    声誉重要？金钱重要？
    旅游业深层发展的另一标志是，要以全方位的高质服务赢得闪光的声誉。如果收入与声誉发生矛盾时，宁可暂时忍痛舍弃眼前收入而要确保声誉无损。
    泰国１９８７年举办“旅游年”，接待外国游客３４０万，比１９８６年猛增２０％。正处于蓬勃向上的泰国旅游业决策层，并没有热昏头脑，他们在全面权衡利弊得失后，将１９８８年的增长目标降为１０％，半年后再次降为８％。他们认为，尽管目前一切顺利，但如果听任旅游者似潮水般涌来，饭店爆满，交通紧张，导游素质下降等恶果将不可避免。与其因盲目发展导致旅游业声誉受损，不如提早控制闸门，以保障旅游业的持续稳定发展。
    泰国明智的决策给我们的启示是：旅游业发展速度不是越快越好，游客不是在任何条件下都是越多越好；旅游发展速度有一个最佳值，过了这个“值”，到时必得“报应”。
    至于“１５００家旅游饭店怎么办”的问题，同样要放到声誉得失的天平上去权衡。如果以进一步损害声誉的沉重代价来勉强填饱饭店的肚子，则将继续维持“饭店短缺”的假象，而造成恶性循环。
