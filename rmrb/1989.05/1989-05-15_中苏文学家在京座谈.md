Three contemporary Soviet writers, Zaregin, Aitmatov, and Rasputin, held a symposium with over 40 Chinese scholars who study Soviet literature on May 13.

Both sides showed great interest in the symposium. Chinese scholars asked about the current state of literary creation and publishing in the Soviet Union, the writers' attitudes towards reform, the social responsibilities of writers, and their views on their own works. The three Soviet writers responded frankly.

The three writers represent the highest level of contemporary Soviet literature. Their works have been translated into various languages and enjoy a worldwide reputation. Among them, Zaregin and Aitmatov are also executive secretaries of the Soviet Writers' Union. They arrived in Beijing on May 11 and will accompany General Secretary Gorbachev during his visit to China.
