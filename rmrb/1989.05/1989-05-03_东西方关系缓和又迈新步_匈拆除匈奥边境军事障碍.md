East-West relations have taken another step forward with Hungary beginning to dismantle its military obstacles along the Hungarian-Austrian border.

Hungary started dismantling its electronic alert system along the Hungarian-Austrian border on May 2, marking another step in the easing of East-West relations.

The approximately 350-kilometer-long Hungarian-Austrian border is part of the long border line between the Warsaw Pact and Western countries. Hungary has been heavily fortified along this line since 1949. Between 1965 and 1971, Hungary constructed a 260-kilometer-long electronic alert system along this border to more effectively prevent people from crossing. This system consists of a 2-meter-high electric fence carrying a low-voltage current. Upon contact with a person or object, the monitoring station's instruments immediately indicate the exact location of the incident.

As East-West relations improve and Hungary allows its citizens to travel to the West freely, Hungary has deemed such an electronic alert system unnecessary. Therefore, it has decided to dismantle the entire system from May 2 to December 31, 1990.

A reporter saw Hungarian soldiers beginning to dismantle the electronic alert system near the Hajós region on that day. Some soldiers used long-handled pliers to cut the wire mesh and remove the concrete posts.

According to another report, Hungary also plans to soon destroy the loose soil strips along the Hungarian-Austrian border used to detect the footprints of border crossers.

### 东西方关系缓和又迈新步  匈拆除匈奥边境军事障碍

    匈拆除匈奥边境军事障碍
    新华社布达佩斯５月２日电  （记者侯凤菁）匈牙利从５月２日开始拆除设在匈奥边界的电子警报装置系统，在缓和东西方关系的道路上又迈出新的一步。
    长约３５０公里的匈牙利—奥地利边界是横亘在华约与西方国家之间漫长边界线的一部分，匈牙利自１９４９年以来一直沿线严密设防。匈还在１９６５年至１９７１年沿着这条边界线修建了一条总长度为２６０公里的电子警报装置系统，以便更有效地防止有人越境。这是一种高２米左右的电网，通有低压电流。一经人或物触及，监控站的仪器立即可准确地显示出出事的位置。
    随着东西方关系的不断改善和匈牙利准许公民随意去西方。匈认为这样的电子警报系统已无存在的必要。因此，决定从５月２日至１９９０年１２月３１日全部拆除。
    记者当天在海杰什豪洛姆地区附近看到匈军官兵开始拆除电子报警装置的情景。一些战士手握长柄钢钳将铁丝网一点点剪断并把混凝土桩拔掉。
    另据报道，匈牙利还准备不久在匈奥边界线上毁掉用以发现越境者脚印的松土带。
