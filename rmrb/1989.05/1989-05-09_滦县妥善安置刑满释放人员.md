Luan County Properly Settles Released Prisoners

The local governments at various levels in Luan County, Hebei Province, do not discriminate against or shun released prisoners, and they have properly settled them, achieving good social effects.

Since 1984, 800 criminals in this county have been reformed in labor reform units. To make them become new people who are beneficial to society, in the second half of 1987, this county signed a cooperation agreement on re-education and settlement with relevant labor reform units. In early 1988, all 31 townships in the county signed responsibility statements with the county government for settling released prisoners.

For the 72 released prisoners whose household registrations are in rural areas, this county, while solving problems such as contracted land and housing sites, pays attention to playing to their strengths in actual work. For criminals who will be released from prison by 1990 in this county, the county has established a registration file. The main leaders of the county government and the procurator-general of the county procuratorate have visited relevant labor reform units multiple times to understand the reform situation of the criminals and listen to their opinions on settlement after release.

　　滦县妥善安置刑满释放人员
    本报讯  河北省滦县各级政府对刑满释放人员不歧视，不嫌弃，予以妥善安置，收到了较好的社会效果。
    自一九八四年以来，这县有八百名罪犯在劳改单位接受改造。为使他们成为对社会有益的新人，一九八七年下半年，这县同有关劳改单位签定了帮教和安置工作协议书。一九八八年初，全县三十一个乡镇，又和县政府签定了安置刑释人员责任状。
    对户口在农村的七十二名刑释人员，这县在解决承包地和房基地等问题的同时，注意在实际工作中发挥他们的特长。对本县到一九九○年刑满释放的犯人，该县建立了立档登记册。县政府主要领导和县检察院检察长多次到有关劳改单位了解犯人的改造情况，听取他们对出狱后的安置意见。　　（张景田　曹荣和）
