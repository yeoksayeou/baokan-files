Unlawful Vendors Continue to Tarnish the Capital!

Reporters Jiang Di, Cui Yuewen, Li Jinhong

“What has happened to the vendors selling watermelons at the Beijing Zoo’s 332 bus stop who cheat customers?” After the April 12th edition of our newspaper published the letter to the editor “This Type of Vendor Should Be Strictly Rectified, and They Should Not Be Allowed to Tarnish the Capital,” many readers have inquired about the situation. The following is a report from our reporters who visited the site several times:

On April 23rd (Sunday) afternoon, the area around the Beijing Zoo’s 332 bus stop was bustling with activity, and tourists were streaming in. In front of the watermelon stands, the market management department had newly set up three blackboards with the following information: “Watermelons are 3.5 yuan per 500 grams; Hami melons are 4 yuan per 500 grams. Please pay first, then eat the melon.” The vendors were calling out in a muddled voice, “Watermelons for sale, 3.5 yuan!”

At around 3:30 PM, a transaction occurred at stall number 55. Six customers bought three watermelons. The customers requested that the melons be cut into six portions, and the vendor complied. Seeing that two of the customers had started eating, the vendor demanded payment: “6,000 grams, 22.8 yuan, please pay!” and threatened, “Don’t ask how much per pound, just pay!” The customers found the price too high and requested a refund, but the vendor shouted, “Refund what? You’ve already eaten it, no refund!” One of the customers showed a small piece of melon to the reporter: “This small piece of melon doesn’t even weigh half a pound (250 grams), but they want 2 pounds (1,000 grams) worth of money, it’s really cheating!” The reporter suggested they go to the market management office to report the issue, but they hesitantly said, “We’re from the countryside, it’s our first time in this big city, we’ll just take the loss.” These six people from Henan’s Lankao County left with a heart full of anger.

How about the other stalls? Let’s look at the experience of two brothers from Heilongjiang’s Qing’an County, Gu Guangshun and Gu Guangmin: The two brothers bought two watermelons at stall number 59. The female vendor said they weighed 7,600 grams, costing 28.8 yuan. They thought the melons were too expensive and suggested finding a place to discuss it. At this point, a few burly men came out from behind the stall and dragged the brothers inside without a word. One of the dark-skinned men said menacingly, “Don’t think you can find justice here, pay up! If you don’t pay, I’ll beat you to death!” He spoke and struck, slapping Gu Guangshun twice. After a few people pulled the attacker aside, they surrounded the brothers and said, “Pay up and leave, if you don’t pay, we’ll beat you! There’s no place to complain here!” Indeed, they were right. When Gu Guangshun and Gu Guangmin went to the market management office of the Beijing Zoo area, the person on duty, Mr. Zhang, said, “Our commerce bureau knows about these things but can’t do anything about it. You’ve already taken the loss and been beaten, just consider it a lesson learned!” Gu Guangshun, covering his sore cheek, said to the reporter, “Beijing really has no place to find justice!” This incident occurred at 7 PM.

Since the letter to the editor was published in our newspaper on April 12th, some of the watermelon vendors did show some restraint for a few days, but they quickly reverted to their old ways. It is understood that the Xicheng District government has also received calls from the public: if the issue of vendors cheating customers at the Beijing Zoo bus stop is not resolved, we will organize our own strike force to deal with it. It seems that the public has had enough of the cheating tactics of these unlawful vendors.

### 不法摊贩还在给首都抹黑！

　　不法摊贩还在给首都抹黑！
    本报记者  蒋铎  崔悦温  李晋鸿
    “北京动物园３３２路车站对面坑骗顾客的卖瓜摊贩怎么样了？”４月１２日本报第六版刊登了信访调查《这类摊商应严加整顿，不许他们给首都抹黑》后，许多读者来信询问。下面介绍的，是记者几次到实地了解的情况：
    ４月２３日（星期日）下午，动物园３３２路汽车站附近车水马龙，游客川流不息。瓜摊前，市场管理部门新设置的３块黑板上面写着：“西瓜每斤（５００克）３．５元；哈密瓜每斤（５００克）４元。请先付款，后吃瓜。”卖瓜人含混不清地高声叫卖：“吃西瓜啦，三毛五！”
    ３点半左右，５５号摊位来买卖了。６位顾客买了３块西瓜。顾客要求将瓜切成６份，卖瓜人如数切好。商贩看到其中两位顾客已吃上了，便开口要钱：“６０００克，２２块８角，请交钱！”并威胁“甭问多少钱１斤，交钱！”顾客嫌贵要求退瓜，商贩大声叫道：“退什么？都吃了，不退！”一位顾客把这一小块瓜给记者看：“这么一小块瓜连半斤（２５０克）都没有，却要俺２斤（１０００克）的钱，真坑人！”记者要他们去找市场管理处反映，他们胆怯地说：“俺们是乡下人，第一次来这大地方，吃点亏算了。”这６位来自河南兰考县的乡下人带着满腔的怒气离去。
    别的摊位怎么样呢？请看黑龙江庆安县顾广顺两兄弟的遭遇：顾氏兄弟俩在５９号瓜摊买了两块西瓜，卖瓜的女贩说是７６００克，２８块８角。他俩认为瓜太贵，提出找个地方说说理去。这时，从瓜摊后面出来几条大汉，不由分说就把顾氏兄弟往里拉。其中一个黑黑的男人恶狠狠地说：“在这儿甭想找好，给钱！不给钱，我打死你！”话到手到，左右开弓，抽了顾广顺两个耳光。另几个人把打人者拉到一边后，又围住顾氏兄弟俩说：“拿钱走人，不掏钱，还揍你！在这儿，你们没地方告去！”果然，他们说对了。当顾广顺、顾广民兄弟俩找到动物园地区市场管理处时，值班的一位姓张的人说：“我们工商局知道这些事儿也管不了，你们亏也吃了，打也挨了，就算花钱买个教训吧！”顾广顺捂着生疼的腮帮子，痛心地对记者说：“北京真没个说理的地方！”这事发生在下午７点钟。
    ４月１２日本报信访调查见报以来，一些瓜摊的商贩开始几天确也有所收敛，但很快就故态复萌了。据了解，西城区政府也曾接到群众的电话：说动物园车站瓜摊坑骗顾客的问题如再不解决，我们要自己组织打击队解决。看来，群众对一些不法商贩的坑人行径已深恶痛绝。
