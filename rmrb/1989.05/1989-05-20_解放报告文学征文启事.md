Call for Submissions: Liberation Reportage Literature

This year marks the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, and also the 10th anniversary of the new situation opened up by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, which marked the beginning of China's reform and opening up. One is about gaining new life from under the heavy oppression of the "three big mountains" of the old society, and the other is about winning freedom from the shackles of the ultra-left line. For the Chinese people, 1989 indeed has a double significance. And the words that can best summarize this double significance are "liberation"!

This is political liberation, liberation of thought and ideology, liberation of productive forces and ways of life. Ultimately, it is the liberation of people.

To commemorate and promote this liberation, the Literary Department of this newspaper, in consultation with the First Automobile Works, famous for producing the Liberation brand cars, has decided to jointly hold this "Liberation Reportage Literature" writing contest.

Content and Requirements: Using the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation and the 10th anniversary of reform and opening up as the backdrop, truly reflect the arduous journey and great achievements of the various ethnic groups of our country in the historical process of pursuing liberation and building a new socialist life. It can review the victories already won, and also focus on the challenges that still lie ahead, especially to showcase the diverse and colorful appearances of the people in the practice of contemporary reform and opening up. Short pieces are encouraged, with each piece not exceeding 9,000 words. We eagerly await more works with broad perspectives, deep insights, substantial content, innovative forms, and unique styles.

Submission Guidelines: Selected submissions will be published, and renowned writers and critics will be invited to select outstanding pieces for first, second, and third prizes. Please send submissions to "Literary Department, Liberation Reportage Literature Contest, People's Daily, Beijing." Do not submit the same piece to multiple contests.

　　解放报告文学征文启事
    今年是中华人民共和国建国四十周年，也是以党的十一届三中全会为标志的我国改革开放开创新局面十周年。一个是从旧社会“三座大山”的重压下获得新生，一个是从极左路线的枷锁下赢得自由。对于我国人民来说，一九八九年实在具有双重的纪念意义。而能够对这双重意义予以简明深刻的概括的，则莫过于“解放”二字了！
    这是政治的解放，思想观念的解放，生产力和生活方式的解放。归根结蒂，是人的解放。
    为了纪念和弘扬这种解放，本报文艺部经与以生产解放牌汽车著称的第一汽车制造厂协商，决定联合举办此次解放报告文学征文活动。
    征文内容和要求：以建国四十周年、改革开放十周年为背景，真实地反映我国各族人民在追求解放、建设社会主义新生活历史进程中的艰难险阻和丰功伟绩，既可回顾已经赢得的胜利，又可注目尚待开创的荆途，尤其要表现人民在当代改革开放实践中多姿多色的风采。提倡短作，最长每篇不得超过九千字。亟望有更多思路开阔、见地精深、内容厚实、形式新颖、风格独具的作品面世。
    征文办法：来稿择优刊出，并聘请著名作家、评论家从中选出优者若干篇，分一、二、三等予以奖励。来稿请寄“北京人民日报文艺部解放报告文学征文组”。勿一稿两投。应征稿件一律不退。
