Six years ago, Sun Guojiang was a stern military officer. Today, he is a renowned "boss" and has been included in the "Directory of Contemporary Chinese Entrepreneurs" with outstanding achievements.

He didn't speak for half a year

On December 25, 1982, Sun Guojiang took off his military uniform and joined the Mouping County Chemical Construction Company, a unit where everything was new, taking up the position of deputy manager. He felt that everything was unnatural and he couldn't get used to it. For more than half a year, no matter what kind of meeting the company held, he never spoke a word. However, he was not idle; he maintained his habit from the army, talking to comrades, observing, and thinking, seeing and understanding everything with his own eyes. He discovered that the company had three fatal weaknesses: first, relying on state plans, lazy and scattered; second, acting as if they were the "boss" of materials, with serious bureaucratic and commercial attitudes; third, issuing and approving vouchers indiscriminately, failing to guarantee planned supply to planned units.

He decided to assist the company's main leaders in rectifying work discipline and turning around the passive situation. In October 1983, Sun Guojiang, together with the head of the business department, rode bicycles for nearly a month, visiting some old customers in the county to solicit opinions and report the material demand plan for the next year. Many factories, mines, and enterprises reflected: "The material boss has changed." Just at this time, in November 1983, higher authorities appointed Sun Guojiang as the company manager.

No "Three Big Moves" on Taking Office

At his first staff meeting, Sun Guojiang announced: I do not approve of the so-called "three fires" or "three big moves." We are running a business, doing business, and we need a long-term plan, absolutely not seeking short-term satisfaction.

With this statement, those who were originally worried about a big change of guard felt relieved. Sun Guojiang, based on the problems he had discovered over half a year, began to rectify work discipline and change the business style, establishing and improving the responsibility system from top to bottom, and implementing responsibilities for each department and employee.

In 1984, the company's sales revenue increased to 7.07 million yuan, with profits growing by 29% compared to the previous year.

Five Years, Ten Times Growth

Sun Guojiang has been the manager since 1984, and it has been five years now. In 1988, his company's sales revenue and profit were more than ten times what they were five years ago, increasing from 5.08 million yuan in sales and 870,000 yuan in profit in 1983 to over 50 million yuan in sales and over 10 million yuan in profit!

It is worth mentioning that in 1987, higher authorities decided to split the "Chemical Construction Company" into "Chemical Light Industry" and "Building Materials" companies. Sun Guojiang was assigned to "Chemical Light Industry." After the split, the number of employees decreased, and the business scope narrowed. Sun Guojiang, based on consolidating the original joint venture relationship, also established joint ventures with large enterprises such as the China Agricultural Company, Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Company, and Shenyang Chemical Factory. That year, he achieved a sales revenue of 34.2 million yuan and a profit of 5.1 million yuan. Now, the path is wide open and getting broader.

　　从军官到“老板”   
    ——记山东牟平化轻公司经理孙国江
    曲怀生
    六年前，孙国江尚是一名威武戎装的军官，如今，却成了大名鼎鼎的“老板”，并以优异成绩被编入《中国当代企业家名典》。
    他半年没发一句言
    １９８２年１２月２５日，孙国江脱下军装，来到牟平县化建公司这个业务、人员一色全生的单位，坐上了副经理的位置，他几乎感到一切都不自然，看不惯，在半年多的时间里，公司不管召开大会小会，他从未发过一句言。不过，他并没有闲着，还是在部队上那个习惯，找同志谈心，观察、思考，眼到心到。他发现这个公司有三个致命弱点：一是坐吃国家计划，人懒心散；二是以“物老大”自居，官商作风严重；三是滥批条子，滥开口子，计划供应不保计划单位。
    他决心协助公司主要领导整顿工作纪律，扭转被动局面。１９８３年１０月，孙国江同业务科室负责人一起，骑上自行车，用了近一个月的时间，到县城一些老用户家征求意见，征报下个年度的物资需求计划。许多厂矿企业纷纷反映：“物老大变了。”正在这时候，１９８３年１１月份，上级任命孙国江担任公司经理。
    上任不砍“三板斧”
    孙国江在他召开的第一个职工大会宣布：我不赞成什么“三把火”、“三板斧”的，我们搞企业，做生意，要有个长远之计，绝不能求一时痛快。
    话这一说，原来担心搞大换班的人们心安了。孙国江针对半年多发现的问题，开始整顿工作纪律，转变经营作风，自上而下建立和完善了岗位责任制，对每个科室、职工逐级落实了责任。
    １９８４年，全公司销售额增加到７０７万元，利润比上年增长了２９％。
    五年长十倍
    孙国江从１９８４年当经理，至今５个年头了。１９８８年，他的公司的销售额、利润额均是５年前的十倍多，即由１９８３年的销售额５０８万元、利润８．７万元猛增到销售额５０００多万元、利润１００多万元！
    值得一表的是，１９８７年，上级决定将“化建公司”分为“化轻”和“建材”两个公司，孙国江分到“化轻”。一分家，人员少了，业务范围小了，孙国江在巩固原有联营关系的基础上，又与中国农业公司、北京燕山石化公司、沈阳化工厂等大企业联营，当年实现销售额３４２０万元，利润５１万元。如今，路子四通八达，越走越宽。
