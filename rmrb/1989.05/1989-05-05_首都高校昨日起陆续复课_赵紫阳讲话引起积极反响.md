	In the capital's universities, after nearly two weeks of student strikes, today was the first day of their announced resumption of classes. Our reporters visited nine universities and found that the campuses had generally returned to their usual tranquility, with most classrooms filled with students attentively attending lectures. During conversations with teachers and students, Zhao Ziyang's speech yesterday became a common topic.

	In Tsinghua University, today about 80% to 90% of the students were in the classrooms, and the teaching buildings were orderly. It was reported that even political courses like "Contemporary Socialism," which usually had fewer attendees, were full today. The English proficiency exam originally scheduled for May 18 is expected to proceed as planned.

	At Beijing University of Technology, over 80% of the students attended classes, close to the usual attendance. Associate Professor He Fucuan of the Mechanical Engineering Department told the reporter, "The learning order after resuming classes is particularly good, even better than before the strike." The school is currently discussing with teachers and students how to make up for the missed classes.

	According to statistics from the Academic Affairs Department of Beijing University of Technology, 2,879 students attended classes this morning, accounting for 74.6% of the total student population. In a classroom of the Management Department, a few self-study students shared their views on resuming classes with the reporter. Some said, "We should resume classes. Seeing the party and government being so rational, students should also be rational." Others said, "The strike has already had an impact and effect, and the goal is basically achieved." Some also said, "Resuming classes is a reluctant decision."

	At Beijing Agricultural University, according to the teaching plan, 26 classes were scheduled for this morning, but 24 classes actually had classes; 820 students attended classes, accounting for 76% of those who should have attended.

	At Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the student attendance rate today was 67.5%. The person in charge of the Academic Affairs Office said, "There should be no problem with full resumption of classes next Monday." A student from the class of 1986 said, "Although we proposed 'strike but not study,' learning is still affected. After hearing Zhao Ziyang's speech, I feel that the strike should be ended."

	At Renmin University of China, more than half of the students were in class or studying in the library this morning.

	In the quiet campus of the Central Academy of Fine Arts, the "Notice of Resuming Classes" was particularly eye-catching. The leaders of the academy went to various classrooms to check the resumption of classes.

	In Peking University and Beijing Normal University, the campuses were also very quiet today, with fewer people looking at big-character posters compared to previous days. The number of students attending classes increased, but many students still did not come to class. In the main teaching buildings of Peking University, 48 out of 134 classrooms were in class; each classroom had about half the number of students who should have been present. It is understood that the reasons why some students did not come to class are: some participated in the parade yesterday and were tired; some went home or on a spring outing during the strike; and some still insist on striking, reasoning that the purpose of dialogue with party and government leaders has not been achieved. Most students at Beijing Normal University expressed, "Next Monday, we will all go to class."

	During the reporter's visit to the nine universities, almost everywhere, Zhao Ziyang's speech was the topic of discussion. Last night when the TV station broadcast Zhao Ziyang's speech, many students who participated in the parade had not yet returned to school. Today, students heard the broadcast and saw the newspaper, and the discussion became heated. The reporter heard at noon in the canteens of some universities that Zhao Ziyang's speech became the central topic at the dining table.

	Zhao Ziyang's speech received widespread praise from teachers and students. Students at Beijing University of Technology generally believed in the discussion that Zhao Ziyang's speech found the common ground between the party and government and the students. They summarized their feelings into three points: first, authenticity, the speech pointed out that students are both satisfied and dissatisfied with the Communist Party and the government, which reflected everyone's true feelings; second, objectivity, the speech pointed out that a few people would exploit students, rather than saying they had already manipulated students, which was relatively in line with reality; third, fairness, the speech affirmed students' patriotic enthusiasm, dispelling everyone's doubts.

	A student from the Economics Department at Beijing Normal University said, "Zhao Ziyang's speech showed the sincerity of the party and government, truly regarding us college students as Zhao Ziyang said, our purpose would be achieved." However, another student majoring in Chinese literature expressed his views, "Zhao Ziyang's speech only shows an attitude, the key is whether there can be real measures and actions."

	The student Deng Liangping from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, who had left the scene during the dialogue with the government spokesperson a few days ago, said, "Zhao Ziyang's speech is reasonable and moderate, making it easy to accept." A teacher from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics said, "The speech mentioned the issue of corruption, and I hope the central government can take action, especially on the issues of official profiteering and clean governance, to set a few examples."

	A party committee leader at the Central Academy of Fine Arts told the reporter, "Zhao Ziyang's speech proposed to 'conduct extensive consultations and dialogues,' and I couldn't help but think of Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Chen Yi who often visited universities, talked with teachers and students, and the hearts were close, making problems easier to solve."

### 首都高校昨日起陆续复课  赵紫阳讲话引起积极反响

　　首都高校昨日起陆续复课    
    赵紫阳讲话引起积极反响
    本报北京５月５日讯  在首都一些高校学生罢课近两周后，今天是他们宣布复课的第一天。本报记者分头走访了９所高校，看到校园里普遍恢复了往日的平静，大多数教室里坐着专心上课的学生。在记者同师生们交谈中，赵紫阳昨天的讲话成了共同的话题。
    清华园里，今天已有８０％到９０％的学生坐在教室里，各个教学楼秩序井然。据介绍，连平日听课学生不多的“当代社会主义”这样的政治课，今天也坐满了学生。原先安排在５月１８日举行的英语等级考试，可望按计划进行。
    北京科技大学也已有８０％以上的学生上课，接近平时上课的人数。机械系副教授何福泉告诉记者：“复课后的学习秩序特别好，比罢课前还要好。”学校正在同师生们商量如何补课。
    据北京理工大学教务部统计，今天上午共有２８７９名同学上课，占全校学生人数的７４．６％。在管理系的一间教室里，几位自修的学生向记者谈了自己对复课的看法。有的说：“应该复课了。看到党和政府那样理智，学生也应该理智。”有的说：“罢课已产生了影响和效果，目的基本达到。”也有的说：“复课是不得已而为之。”
    在北京农业大学，按教学计划今天上午应有２６个班有课，实际上课２４个班；８２０名上课学生占应上课学生的７６％。
    北京航空航天大学今天学生到课率为６７．５％。教务处负责人说：“下周一全部复课问题不大。”８６级一位学生说：“虽说我们提出‘罢课不罢学’，但学习还是受影响的。听了赵紫阳的讲话，我觉得罢课应打上个句号了。”
    中国人民大学今天上午有半数以上的学生在上课或到图书馆学习。
    在静谧的中央美术学院校园里，《复课通告》特别醒目。学院领导都到各教室查看复课情况去了。
    在北京大学和北京师范大学，今天校园里也十分平静，看大字报的人数比前几天显著减少。上课的学生增加了，但仍有许多同学没来上课。北京大学主要教学楼１３４个教室，有４８个教室在上课；每个教室听课的学生约为应到数的一半左右。据了解，部分学生不来上课的原因，一是有的昨天参加游行走累了；二是有的罢课期间回家或春游去了；三是仍有人坚持罢课，理由是跟党和政府领导人的对话的目的尚未达到。北师大的大多数学生表示：“下星期一我们都要去上课。”
    记者在９所高校采访，所到之处，几乎都在议论赵紫阳的讲话。昨天晚上电视台播放紫阳讲话时，许多参加游行的学生尚未返校，今天同学们听到广播、看到报纸，热烈地议论开了。记者中午在一些高校的学生食堂里，听到赵紫阳的讲话成了餐桌上的中心话题。
    赵紫阳的讲话在师生中获得广泛好评。北京科技大学的学生在议论中普遍认为，紫阳讲话找到了党和政府与学生的共同点。他们把自己的感受概括为三条：一是真实，讲话中指出学生对共产党和政府又满意又不满意，讲出了大家的真实心态；二是客观，讲话中指出少数人会利用学生，而不是说已操纵了学生，比较符合实际；三是公正，对学生的爱国热情作了肯定，解除了大家的疑虑。
    北师大一位经济系的学生说：“紫阳的讲话表明了党和政府的诚意，真像紫阳说的那样看我们大学生，我们的目的就达到了。”但也有另一位学中文的同学发表自己的看法：“紫阳的讲话仅仅表明一种态度，关键是能否真正有措施有行动。”
    前几天曾经在与政府发言人“对话”时退场的北航学生邓良平说：“紫阳的讲话中肯、平和，叫人容易接受。”北航的一位教师则认为：“讲话提到了腐败问题，更希望中央能有所行动，在官倒和廉政问题上抓几个典型。”
    中央美术学院一位党委负责人对记者说：“紫阳讲话中提出要‘广泛进行协商对话’，我不由地想起当年周总理、陈毅副总理经常到大学走走，找师生们谈谈，心就贴紧了，问题就好解决了。”
