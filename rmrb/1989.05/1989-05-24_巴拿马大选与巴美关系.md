The general elections held in Panama in early May this year resulted in a serious political crisis, drawing the attention of Latin American countries, particularly the United States. This political crisis is essentially a new round of confrontation between the two major factions within Panama.

Before the elections, the ruling Democratic Revolutionary Party, backed by Panama's strongman Manuel Noriega, along with several smaller parties, formed the National Liberation Alliance and nominated Noriega's friend Carlos Duque as their presidential candidate. The opposition Civic Alliance for Renewal, on the other hand, put forward Guillermo Endara, a close political ally of the late former president Arnulfo Arias. After the voting on May 7, both sides, based on their own tally results, claimed victory. The political situation in Panama became chaotic, leading the National Electoral Tribunal to suspend the vote count. The capital was tense, with soldiers from the "2000th Battalion" surrounding the tribunal building, and opposition leaders' residences were also cordoned off by military police. The opposition held protests and marches, accusing the government of election fraud. Clashes between protesters and police resulted in multiple injuries, including the opposition presidential candidate Endara and his running mate. Meanwhile, Noriega held an emergency meeting with President Francisco Rodríguez and cabinet members to discuss the post-election situation. Subsequently, the electoral court declared the elections invalid. The opposition strongly protested this decision and organized a nationwide strike on May 17, condemning the government's annulment of the elections and demanding that the government respect the will of the people and acknowledge the opposition's victory.

Latin American countries closely monitored the situation in Panama. Foreign ministers from Argentina and five other countries unanimously expressed hope that Panama's factions would peacefully resolve the political crisis and opposed foreign interference in Panama's internal affairs. The Organization of American States also passed a resolution blaming Noriega for the crisis and urging him to transfer power to "democratic institutions."

The United States reacted most strongly, condemning the Panamanian government's use of violence and accusing Noriega of election fraud. On May 11, President George H.W. Bush ordered the deployment of an additional 2,000 troops to the U.S. military bases in the Canal Zone. He also publicly incited the Panamanian people and military to overthrow Noriega.

Why did the U.S. government rush to deploy troops and resort to "gunboat diplomacy" against small Panama? The media analyzed that this was not only to protect the safety of 50,000 American expatriates but more importantly to safeguard U.S. strategic interests in the Panama Canal Zone, including political, economic, and military aspects. Panama holds significant strategic importance for the United States. The U.S. has over 10,000 troops stationed in the Canal Zone, with 14 military bases and the headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command. The U.S. earns over $100 million annually from canal transit fees.

According to the new "Panama Canal Treaties" signed by the U.S. and Panama in September 1977, Panama will fully regain sovereignty over the canal by December 31, 1999, and U.S. troops will also withdraw completely. According to foreign reports, after the Reagan administration took office, the U.S. has consistently hoped to retain its military bases in the Panama Canal Zone after the year 2000 and continue to control the canal, but this has been firmly rejected by Panama's strongman Noriega. This is considered the crux of the U.S.'s recent attempts to oust Noriega.

After Noriega became the commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces in 1983, effectively controlling the military and political power, U.S.-Panama relations have been strained. In June of the previous year, the U.S. strongly supported the Panamanian opposition's movement to oust Noriega. In February of this year, the U.S. District Court in Miami filed a lawsuit against Noriega, accusing him of involvement in drug trafficking. In late February, the U.S.-backed Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle failed to oust Noriega and was instead impeached by the National Assembly controlled by Noriega. The Assembly then appointed Francisco Rodríguez as president. However, the U.S. government has never recognized the legitimacy of the Rodríguez government and has used economic sanctions, asset freezes, and other measures to force Noriega to step down, all of which have failed.

At the beginning of this year, as Panama's election activities began, the U.S. fully supported the opposition, hoping for their victory to achieve the goal of ousting Noriega. To this end, the U.S. announced the extension of economic sanctions against Panama for another year and ordered U.S. troops in the Canal Zone to be on alert, putting pressure on Noriega. The Panamanian government did not back down. The foreign minister criticized the U.S. for creating tension and accused the U.S. of providing $1 million in election funds to the Panamanian opposition. The ruling party's candidate also condemned the U.S. for creating chaos and seeking pretexts for military intervention.

It was under these circumstances that Panama's announcement of the elections being invalid dashed the Bush administration's hopes of ousting Noriega. Thus, the U.S. decided to increase troops in Panama and publicly incite the Panamanian people and military to overthrow Noriega. U.S.-Panama relations have reached a boiling point.

Currently, the situation in Panama remains severe. Whether the two major factions within Panama can peacefully resolve the political crisis, and what actions the U.S. will take next, these are all of great concern to the international community.

　　巴拿马大选与巴美关系
    成元生
    巴拿马于今年５月初举行的大选酿成一场严重的政治危机，引起了拉美国家，尤其是美国的关注。这场政治危机，实际上是巴拿马国内两大派的一次新较量。
    大选前，巴拿马铁腕人物诺列加支持的执政党民主革命党与几个小党组成民族解放联盟，推选诺列加的好友卡洛斯·杜克为总统候选人，而公民反对派民主联盟则推举已故老政治家、前总统阿里亚斯的政治密友恩达拉出马与之对阵。５月７日举行投票后，两派根据“各自计票结果”，都宣称自己获胜。巴拿马政局出现混乱，全国计票委员会随之中止计票，首都呈现紧张状态。国防军“２０００营”的士兵包围了全国计票委员会大楼，反对派领导人驻地也被军警包围。反对派举行游行示威，抗议政府在大选中舞弊。示威者与警察发生冲突，造成多人伤亡，反对派总统候选人恩达拉和副总统候选人也被打伤。与此同时，诺列加与总统帕尔马及内阁部长举行紧急会议，讨论选举后形势。接着，选举法庭宣布大选无效。反对派强烈抗议这一做法，并于１７日组织全国性罢工，谴责政府宣布大选无效，要求政府尊重民意，承认反对派获胜。
    拉美国家非常关注巴拿马局势。阿根廷等６国外长一致表示，希望巴拿马各派和平解决政治危机，反对外国干涉巴拿马内政。美洲国家组织外长会议还通过一项议案，指责诺列加对危机负有责任，呼吁诺列加将权力移交给“民主机构”。
    美国的反应最为强烈。它谴责巴拿马政府采用暴力并指责诺列加在选举中舞弊。１１日，布什总统命令向运河区的美军基地增兵两千人。他还公开鼓动巴拿马人民和军队推翻诺列加。
    美国政府为什么急于调兵遣将，采取“炮舰外交”来对付小小的巴拿马呢？报界分析认为，这不单是要保护５万美国侨民的安全，更重要的是为了维护美国在巴拿马运河区政治、经济、军事等方面的战略利益。巴拿马对美国具有重要的战略地位。美国在运河区驻有１万多军队，建有１４个军事基地，设有美国南方司令部。美国每年从运河通行税中拿走１亿多美元。
    根据１９７７年９月美巴双方签订的新的“巴拿马运河条约”，到１９９９年１２月３１日，巴拿马将全部收回运河主权，美国军队也应全部撤离。据外电透露，美国里根政府上台后一直希望在２０００年以后仍保留美国在巴拿马运河区的军事基地，继续控制运河，但遭到巴拿马实权人物诺列加的坚决拒绝。这被认为是美国近年来要搞掉诺列加的症结所在。
    １９８３年诺列加担任巴拿马国防军司令，实际上掌握了军政大权后，巴美关系一直不和。前年６月，美国大力支持巴拿马反对派倒诺列加的运动，去年２月美国迈阿密地方联邦法院对诺列加提出起诉，指控他参与贩毒。２月下旬，美国支持的巴拿马总统德尔瓦列倒诺列加不成，反被诺列加控制的国民议会罢黜。巴议会另立帕尔马为总统。但是，美国政府始终不承认帕尔马政府的合法性，并且采用经济封锁、冻结资金等制裁手段逼使诺列加下台，这一切均未成功。
    在今年年初，巴拿马大选活动开始后，美国全力支持巴反对派，希望它获胜，以达到把诺列加赶下台的目的。为此，美国宣布把对巴拿马的经济制裁延长一年，并下令美国在运河区的驻军进入戒备状态，向诺列加施加压力。巴拿马政府也不示弱。巴外长抨击美国制造紧张局势，指责美国向巴拿马反对派提供了１０００万美元的竞选费用。巴拿马执政党候选人也谴责美国制造混乱，为进行军事干预寻找借口。
    正是在这种情况下，巴拿马宣布大选无效使布什政府赶诺列加下台的希望落空。于是，美国决定增兵巴拿马，公开鼓动巴人民和军队推翻诺列加。巴美关系到了一触即发的地步。
    目前，巴拿马局势仍然严峻。巴国内两大派能否和平解决政治危机，美国下一步将采取什么行动，这些都是国际社会十分关注的。
