U.S. Develops High-Temperature Superconducting Transistor
Promotes the Manufacture of Superconducting Computers

NEW YORK, May 27 (Xinhua) — Scientists at the University of Houston in the United States have recently developed a "high-temperature superconducting material magnetic field effect transistor," marking a significant breakthrough in the fabrication of electronic components using new superconducting materials.

This was announced yesterday by Professor Wei Kang Zhu of the Department of Physics at the University of Houston. He said that the superconducting device developed by his superconducting research center is equivalent to an electronic transistor but has greater functionality. With four terminals, it can be connected to complex circuits, thereby greatly accelerating the transmission of electronic signals. This overcomes a major obstacle in the manufacture of superconducting computers and other superconducting electronic devices.

　　美制成高温超导晶体管
    将促进超导电脑制造
    本报纽约５月２７日电  记者刘开宸报道：美国休士顿大学的科学家们最近试制成一件“高温超导材料磁场效应晶体管”，是用新超导材料试制电子元件的重大进展。
    这是休士顿大学物理学教授朱伟康昨天宣布的。他说，他的超导研究中心试制成功的超导体器件，相等于电子晶体管，但作用更大。有４个接头，可以连接复杂电路，因而可以极大地加速电子信号的通过，为制造超导电脑和其它超导电子设备克服了一个重要障碍。
