Since the beginning of spring, the drought situation in Heilongjiang Province has become increasingly severe. As of now, the drought-affected area in the province has reached 22.04 million mu, accounting for 17% of the total sowing area.

It is reported that compared to the same period in previous years, the average temperature in Heilongjiang Province in March and April this year was 2 to 4 degrees Celsius higher, and the rainfall was 30% to 50% less. The water volume of the Larin River, Ma Yi River, Hulan River, Muleng River, and other tributaries of the Songhua River has significantly decreased compared to normal years. The water storage of some small reservoirs and most ponds has been greatly reduced, with some even drying up. As a result, the water shortage area for paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province has reached 2.26 million mu, accounting for one-fifth of the province's total paddy field area. The province has established a temporary anti-drought leading group.
