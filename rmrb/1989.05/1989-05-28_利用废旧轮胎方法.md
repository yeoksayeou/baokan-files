	The British magazine "New Scientist" recently published an article titled "The New Path for Old Tires." The summary is as follows:

	Two research teams in the United States have proposed a simple method for converting automobile tires into plastic composite materials. The United States discards 240 million tires annually, and the disposal of these tires has become a more pressing environmental issue than any other. In some states, discarded tires occupy many hectares of land. As more states implement relevant laws, this problem will become even more severe. Many states will have piles of glass, waste paper, used oil, and tires to recycle, but no reliable method has been found to reuse these tires.

	Currently, more than one-third of the oil used to manufacture these tires in the United States is imported. In such a country, tens of billions of used tires represent a vast natural resource.

	A new, cost-effective method for reprocessing these tires has been developed by John Cook from Chester, near Philadelphia. He and his colleagues have devised a method to convert used tires into drainage pipes and fences.

	Meanwhile, in another part of Pennsylvania, people are using a slightly different method to turn used tires back into active substances, allowing them to chemically bond with other plastics. A team at the Compressed Gas Products and Chemicals Company in London, England, is researching a method to convert old rubber into polymer composite materials. These materials can be used to manufacture hoses, rings, rollers, and even new tires. Both methods involve grinding the tires into powder and then mixing them with other plastics to form a composite material, similar to how sand is mixed with cement to form concrete. The price of the products is less than one-quarter of the cost of ordinary polyvinyl chloride pipes. The Compressed Gas Products Company's method is more chemically complex. These tires are ground very finely and then treated with a mixture of gases such as fluorine, oxygen, sulfur dioxide, or chlorine. Fluorine reacts with the surface of the rubber to form free radicals, which then react with other components of the gas to form reactive groups such as hydroxyl groups. These groups form chemical bonds with new polymers, creating a cross-linked composite material that is stronger than a simple mixture of the two components.

	The fineness of the ground rubber determines the final use of the recycled material. Fine rubber powder is suitable for manufacturing new tires and is much cheaper than pure rubber. Coarsely ground rubber can be used to make rings, rubber-coated rollers, and hoses. The Compressed Gas Products Company recently obtained a patent for its method.

　　利用废旧轮胎方法
    英国《新科学家》最近刊登一篇报道，题为《旧轮胎要走的新路》，摘要如下：
    美国的两个研究小组提出了把汽车旧轮胎变成塑料复合材料的简单方法。每年美国要扔掉二点四亿个轮胎，处理这些轮胎现在超过了其他一切环境问题。在一些州，用过的轮胎倾倒处占了许多公顷的土地，随着更多的州实行一些有关的法律，这个问题将变得更加严重。许多州将有一堆堆的玻璃、废纸、用过的油和轮胎要回收，但是还没有人找到一个可靠的办法来重新利用这些轮胎。
    现在美国制造这些轮胎所需的油有三分之一以上是进口的，在这样的国家里，数十亿用过的轮胎是一个巨大的自然资源。
    重新处理这些轮胎的一个廉价的新方法，是费城附近切斯特的约翰·库克创造的。他和他的合作者研究出一种把用过的轮胎变成排水管和栅栏的方法。
    与此同时，在宾夕法尼亚的另一个地方，人们正在采取略微不同的方法来使用过的轮胎重新成为活性物质，以便能与其他塑料进行化学结合。在英国伦敦的压气产品和化学品公司的一个小组正在研究一种把旧橡胶转变为聚合物复合材料的方法，这种材料将适于制造蛇管、衬圈、滚子，甚至还能制成新轮胎。这两种方法都要把轮胎碾成粉末，然后加在其他塑料里，构成一种复合材料，类似把沙子加在水泥里，构成混凝土一样。产品的价格不到普通的聚氯乙烯管子的四分之一。压气产品公司的方法在化学上比较复杂。这些轮胎磨得很细，然后用氟和其他气体，如氧、二氧化硫或氯的混合物进行处理。氟和橡胶的表面发生反应，形成自由基，然后自由基和气体的其他成分发生反应，形成反应基，如羟基。正是这些东西和新的聚合物，为环氧树脂构成化学键，产生一种键合复合材料，它比两种成分的简单混合物牢固。
    碾过的橡胶是否精细，决定回收物资的最后用途。精细的橡胶粉末适于制造新轮胎，而且比纯粹的橡胶便宜得多。碾得较粗的橡胶可用于制造衬圈、橡胶包的滚子和蛇管等。压气产品公司最近获得了其方法的专利权。
