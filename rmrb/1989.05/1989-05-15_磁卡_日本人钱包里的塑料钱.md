People living in modern Japanese society, despite the fact that most of them are accustomed to carrying a beautifully crafted wallet, often find that it contains very few paper bills or coins. Instead, it is filled with various innovative plastic cards – magnetic cards. These include telephone cards, fuel cards, dining cards, savings cards, medical cards, and many others. According to statistics from the Japan Credit Industry Association, by March 1984, Japan had issued a total of 200 million magnetic cards of various types. In recent years, with the development of the information society and advancements in financial electronic technology, the issuance of magnetic cards has increased, and their varieties have multiplied. If this trend continues, it means that by the end of the century, Japan will enter the era of plastic money.

Magnetic cards are generally issued by banks and have a layer of magnetic powder on the plastic card to store the user's name and amount. Users can use credit cards to purchase goods at designated stores. Some credit cards can even be used worldwide, making daily life and international travel more convenient. However, it was soon discovered that although one could use a credit card to shop in a mall, making a phone call required inserting a 10 yen coin every three minutes. Additionally, when buying train or subway tickets on the way to work, one had to exchange large bills for coins and insert them into the automatic ticket machine at each station, which was not only troublesome and time-consuming but also required carrying a significant amount of coins. As a result, various magnetic cards for different purposes flooded into Japanese society. The public telephone card issued by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation has text or images printed on the back according to the user's request, resembling a commemorative card. It can be used for both domestic and international calls. When making a call, simply insert the magnetic card into the phone's card slot, and it will automatically count and eject the card after use, saving the user from the hassle of paying the call fee. The subway ticket card issued by Japanese railways can be used by inserting it into the automatic ticket machine. Even some large Japanese companies issue cafeteria meal cards for the convenience of their employees. Employees can simply insert the card into the magnetic card reader at the cafeteria's food window to deduct the meal cost. Therefore, whether Japanese people are going out to run errands or visiting relatives and friends, they can carry less cash but must not forget to bring their magnetic cards. Recently, a new type of integrated circuit card has appeared in the Japanese market, which is superior to ordinary magnetic cards. This new card has a storage-capable integrated circuit board, not only used for payments but also capable of storing the names, quantities, and amounts of items purchased by the cardholder, and can report the remaining balance at any time. Currently, the "medical integrated circuit card" being tested in the hospital system can store patient data such as name, weight, blood pressure, and electrocardiogram, and can be used as an outpatient medical record. Patients holding this card for a consultation do not need to bring medical records, electrocardiograms, or test reports. The doctor can insert the card into a special device to know the patient's condition. It is predicted that the integrated circuit card is the future development direction.

　　磁卡——日本人钱包里的塑料钱
    生活在现代社会的日本人，尽管大多数都习惯随身携带一只做工精美的钱包，然而，里面装的却很少是纸钞或硬币。而是一枚枚设计新颖的塑料钱——磁性卡片。有电话卡、加油卡、进餐卡、储蓄卡、医疗卡等，五花八门。日本信贷产业协会的统计表明，截至１９８４年３月，日本国内共发行各类磁卡２亿张。近年来，随着信息社会的发展与金融界电子技术的进步，磁卡的发行量越来越大，种类愈来愈多。如按此数计算，则意味着日本人均持有两张磁卡。有关人士预测，到本世纪末，日本将进入塑料钱社会。
    磁卡一般由银行发行，在塑料卡片上涂一层磁粉，存储用户姓名与金额。用户可持信用卡，在指定商店选购物品。有些信用卡还可在世界各国通用，方便了人们的日常生活与海外旅游。然而，不久人们发现，虽然去商场购物持一枚信用卡即可，但打电话时却需要每隔三分钟向话机投币口投入１０日元硬币。而且在上班路上购买电车、地铁票时，需要先将万日元或千日元纸钞兑换成硬币，每到一站，还得把一枚枚向自动售票机投币购票，不仅麻烦费时，而且必须随身携带可观数量的硬币。于是乎，适用于不同用途的各类磁卡潮水般涌入日本社会。日本电信电话公司发行的公用电话卡，卡片背面根据用户要求印上文字或图片，酷似纪念卡，国内、国际电话均可使用。打电话时插入话机磁卡孔内，用毕自动计数退出，免去用户交纳通话费等项烦琐手续。日本地铁发行的电车、地铁购票卡，使用时将其放入自动售票机即可。就连日本一些大公司为了方便职工用餐，还发放了食堂进餐卡，职工就餐时只需在食堂售饭窗口磁卡读出机上一插，便将饭菜金扣除。因此，日本人无论是出门办事，还是探亲访友，钱可以少带，但磁卡不可不带。最近，日本市场出现一种集成电路卡则更优于普通磁卡。磁卡上装一块具有存储功能的集成电路板，这种新卡不仅用于付款，而且可以存储持卡人购买物品的名称、数量、金额，并随时通报余额。目前医院系统试用的“医疗集成电路卡”，可存储病人姓名、体重、血压、心电图等数据，可作门诊病历使用。患者持此卡就诊，不需病历、心电图、化验单等，医生将卡插入专用设备，便知病情。据预测，集成电路卡是今后发展方向。
