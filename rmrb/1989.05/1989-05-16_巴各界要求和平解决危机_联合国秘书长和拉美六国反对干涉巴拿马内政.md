Panamanian sectors call for peaceful resolution of crisis
United Nations Secretary-General and six Latin American countries oppose interference in Panama's internal affairs

	Panamanian society has been urging for a peaceful resolution to the political crisis that arose from the government's declaration of the election results as invalid.

	The National Federation of Public Employees and Associations of Panama issued a statement on May 15, calling for all political factions to cease their disputes and engage in negotiations to peacefully resolve the domestic political crisis. This largest public employees' union in the country also opposed U.S. armed intervention in Panama.

	The Democratic Revolutionary Party, one of the ruling parties in Panama, also advocated for dialogue and consultation in its statement, calling for cooperation among all domestic parties that oppose external intervention and seek democratization.

	Former President of the National Legislative Assembly of Panama, Alemán Boyd, in an open letter, urged people to think calmly and persistently seek peace and understanding to prevent Panama from being interfered with by external forces and to continue its development.

	Meanwhile, the deputy presidential candidate of the Panamanian opposition Democratic Alliance, Fort, reiterated that the opposition alliance hopes to avoid self-inflicted harm among Panamanians and seeks to reach a consensus with the military.

	The Panamanian Church has also held large-scale religious ceremonies in recent days, praying for peace and democracy within the country.

	According to a report from our correspondent in Mexico City, the Panamanian opposition Democratic Alliance stated today that it will take all peaceful opposition actions and measures until the government acknowledges the opposition's victory in the election.

	The organization also announced a nationwide strike starting tomorrow.

	According to reports from various Mexican television stations, the situation in Panama remains tense. The Panamanian Church today condemned Noriega and demanded that he step down immediately to end the national crisis. The U.S. government has recalled its ambassador to Panama and urged countries to exert political pressure on Noriega to resign from his position as commander of the National Defense Forces.

	It is reported that Spain, Israel, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela have expressed willingness to accept Noriega's asylum. The Mexican television station reported that Noriega owns property and real estate in France, Japan, and Israel, with an estimated total asset value of over $200 million.

	According to a report from our correspondent at the United Nations, United Nations Secretary-General Pérez de Cuéllar expressed his concern about the current situation in Panama on May 14 in Philadelphia, stating that he opposes interference in Panama's internal affairs.

	De Cuéllar pointed out that so far, this is an internal affair of a member state of the United Nations, so "our response must be extremely cautious."

	When a reporter mentioned that the United States was attempting to interfere, De Cuéllar said that the United Nations opposes interference in the internal affairs of a member state.

	De Cuéllar finally emphasized that he hopes the issue in Panama can be resolved peacefully and that democracy can be fully established in Panama.

	According to a report from our correspondent in Beijing, six Latin American foreign ministers expressed their hope for a peaceful resolution to the Panamanian crisis and their opposition to foreign interference in Panama's internal affairs on May 15 in Asunción, Paraguay.

	This was the consensus reached by the foreign ministers of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela after a working meeting.

	They had gathered in Asunción to attend the inauguration ceremony of Paraguay's new president, Rodríguez.

	The six foreign ministers discussed the situation in Panama and the two proposals regarding the Panamanian issue submitted by Peru and Venezuela to the meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of American States to be held in Washington on May 17.

	The foreign ministers present pointed out that the right of self-determination of peoples, the principle of non-interference, and the right of the Panamanian people to choose their own destiny should be respected.
