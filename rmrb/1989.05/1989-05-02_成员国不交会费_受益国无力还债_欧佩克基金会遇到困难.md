	Member States Fail to Pay Dues, Beneficiary Countries Unable to Repay Loans
	OPEC Fund Faces Difficulties

	BEIRUT, May 2 (Xinhua) — A senior official of the OPEC Fund for International Development has recently pointed out that the OPEC Fund is facing difficulties in international development issues. Although oil prices have recently rebounded, some OPEC member states have yet to pay the dues they are required to contribute to the fund. Meanwhile, some beneficiary countries are unable to repay their loans, seriously affecting the fund's cash flow. The official believes that this issue is also part of the global debt crisis.

	The OPEC Fund plays an active role in improving the economies of developing countries. Its mission is to prioritize lending to development projects in the production sector. According to statistics from the fund, in the first three months of this year, the fund provided $246.7 million in loans for agriculture and food industries in developing countries, accounting for 16.3% of the total loan amount. It provided $79.4 million for education and $25.2 million for healthcare, accounting for 1.7%. During this period, the fund provided a total of 476 development loans, offering $350 million in grants to 46 African countries, 23 Asian countries, and 22 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Of this amount, $266.9 million in grants have already been disbursed.

　　成员国不交会费　受益国无力还债    
    欧佩克基金会遇到困难
    本报大马士革５月２日电  记者吕志星报道：最近，欧佩克基金会负责人提出，欧佩克基金会在国际发展问题上遇到困难。尽管近来石油价格有所回升，但部分欧佩克成员国至今不向基金会交纳所规定的会费，另外，一些得到基金会贷款的受益国，对其所欠债务也不能偿还，致使基金会的资金流通受到严重影响。这位负责人认为，这个问题也成为世界债务危机的一个部分。
    欧佩克基金会对改善发展中国家的经济起着积极作用，它的宗旨是优先向生产部门的发展项目提供贷款。据基金会统计数字表明，今年头３个月，基金会为发展中国家的农业和食品工业提供贷款２．４６７亿美元，占总贷款额的１６．３％，为教育事业提供贷款０．７９４亿美元，卫生事业０．２５２亿美元，占１．７％。在这期间，基金会共提供４７６项发展贷款，向４６个非洲国家、２３个亚洲国家及２２个拉丁美洲和加勒比海地区国家提供总值为３５亿美元的赠款，其中２６．６９亿美元赠款已发放。
