The Afghan Mujahideen leaders have reiterated their opposition to the return of former King Zahir Shah to power.

According to a message received here today, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the Foreign Minister of the Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Provisional Government, recently reaffirmed his stance against allowing former Afghan King Zahir Shah to return to the country to rule.

Hekmatyar made this statement at a rally held in the Yaru region of Pakistan's Balochistan Province.

He pointed out that allowing Zahir Shah to return to Afghanistan to rule is a conspiracy by the Soviet Union, India, and the Kabul regime. He said that the Afghan Mujahideen and refugees will unite to resolutely foil any conspiracy to bring Zahir Shah, who is currently in exile in Italy, back to power.

Hekmatyar also said that the Mujahideen and refugees hope to establish an elected government in Afghanistan and gradually form a true Islamic democracy.

According to local newspaper reports, some leaders of the Afghan Mujahideen and many Afghan refugees support the idea of Zahir Shah returning to lead a united government.

　　阿富汗游击队领导人    
    反对前国王回国执政
    新华社伊斯兰堡５月２日电  据此间今天收到的消息说，阿富汗７党联盟临时政府外交部长古勒卜丁·希克马蒂亚尔最近重申了他反对让阿富汗前国王查希尔回国执政的立场。
    希克马蒂亚尔是在巴基斯坦俾路支省亚鲁地区举行的一次集会上重申上述立场的。
    他指出，让查希尔回阿富汗执政是苏联、印度和喀布尔政权搞的阴谋。他说，阿富汗游击队和难民将团结一致，坚决挫败让目前流亡在意大利的查希尔回国执政的任何阴谋。
    希克马蒂亚尔还说，游击队和难民希望在阿富汗成立一个由选举产生的政府，逐步形成一个真正的伊斯兰民主制。
    据当地报纸报道，阿富汗游击队的一些领导人和许多阿富汗难民支持让查希尔回国领导一个联合政府的主张。
