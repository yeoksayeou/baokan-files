The health conditions of primary and secondary schools urgently need improvement. Currently, the health situation in some schools in China has deteriorated compared to the 1950s, which is concerning. From the Guangdong Provincial Health Department and Education Department's plans for the prevention and treatment of intestinal worms, dental caries, and trachoma, it is known that head lice and scabies, which had previously been eradicated, are now spreading in some schools. The infection rates of intestinal worms among urban and county town primary school students are 25.31% and 27.47% respectively, while the infection rate in rural primary school students is 37.06%. Outbreaks of infectious diseases and food poisoning in schools also occur from time to time.

The main reasons for this situation are that the teaching hygiene, environmental hygiene, drinking water hygiene, and food hygiene in schools do not meet health standards. The school health workforce is weak, with an average of only 0.98 school health and hygiene personnel in county-level and above epidemic prevention stations.

Vice Minister of Health He Jie-Sheng pointed out that if effective measures are not taken, it will be difficult to prevent and control the occurrence of hepatitis, typhoid, and food poisoning. All levels of health and education departments must strengthen their leadership, quickly formulate plans to improve school health conditions, and allocate and train school doctors and health teachers.

### 中小学卫生状况亟待改善

　　中小学卫生状况亟待改善
    目前，我国某些学校卫生现状较五十年代有所下降，令人担忧。从广东省卫生厅、教育厅对中小学生蛔虫、龋齿、沙眼等防治方案可知：曾一度销声匿迹的头虱、疥疮在有些学校中又传播流行。该省城市和县城镇小学生蛔虫感染率分别为百分之二十五点三一和百分之二十七点四七，农村小学生蛔虫感染率为百分之三十七点零六。学校的传染病暴发流行和食物中毒也时有发生。
    造成这种状况的主要原因是学校的教学卫生、环境卫生、饮水卫生、饮食卫生不符合卫生要求，学校卫生队伍力量薄弱，县以上防疫站中，学校卫生保健人员平均仅有零点九八人。
    卫生部何界生副部长指出，如不采取有效措施，则很难预防和控制肝炎、伤寒、食物中毒的发生。各级卫生部门和教育部门要切实加强领导，迅速制定改善学校卫生状况的规划及校医、保健教师的配备、培训等。
