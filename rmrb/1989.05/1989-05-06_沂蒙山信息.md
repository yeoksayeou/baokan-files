After attending the Fifth National Congress on Literature and Art, I returned home on China International Airlines Flight 150. The flight from Beijing to Hangzhou took only an hour and a half. Two stewardesses pushed a cart back and forth in the aisle, serving passengers multiple times. They served the day's *People's Daily*, fruit juice, hot coffee, and other beverages three times, and a box of a hearty meal once. Shortly after takeoff, along with the newspaper, they handed out a bag of honey-roasted peanuts.

I read the newspaper while casually munching on these sweet and crispy peanuts. Later, I suddenly realized that this was the very bag of peanuts people often talk about. So, I started paying attention to it. This bag of peanuts weighed less than an ounce, but the kernels were large and uniform. The packaging was exquisite, not inferior to any imported goods. On the front of the colorful plastic bag, there was the logo of China International Airlines and the company name in both Chinese and English, along with illustrations of a bee angel, flowers, and a honeycomb. The back of the bag had product introductions in both Chinese and English. At the bottom, a small line of text read, "Manufactured by Linyi Canned Food Factory, Shandong Province." I couldn't help but exclaim, "Ah! This is a product from the old revolutionary base of Mount Yi!"

At this altitude of nine thousand meters, this bag of peanuts made me recall the scene from three years ago when I revisited Mount Yi with some old colleagues from the *People's Daily*.

At that time, the 80-year-old former editor-in-chief, Comrade Kuang Yaming, stood in front of a dilapidated stone house and said with a heavy heart, "On a winter night in late 1938, I reviewed the proof of the inaugural issue of the *People's Daily* under the oil lamp in this small house. At that time, the old landlord's house still had a wooden threshold. Look, now even the threshold is gone. How can we face the people of the old revolutionary base?"

This small village is called Yun Tou Yu. The impression it left on us was that its appearance was almost the same as it was over forty years ago. Stone houses, low walls, uneven dirt roads, and at the edge of the small square by the village entrance, the ancient millstone was still idle—this square was where they used to have meals and meetings. The difference was that many of the stone houses were even more dilapidated. Inside, the phrase "bare walls and empty rooms" truly applied. The trees and shrubs on the mountain had almost all disappeared, leaving only exposed rocks and gravel. The small stream by the village had dried up long ago, and fetching a basket of water required a round trip of five miles.

It was in these small villages that the highest party, government, and military leadership of the Shandong Anti-Japanese Base Area and the troops were stationed. During those difficult years of war, the local people fed us with corn, sorghum, and sweet potatoes. In the anti-sweep campaigns, they risked their lives to protect us. During the War of Liberation, they carried stretchers and pushed carts, escorting the Liberation Army all the way to the south of the Yangtze River. Yet, after the war, for decades, they lived in such poverty. No wonder they said to us with both complaints and joy, "Fighting the Japanese and the Kuomintang, you relied on us; after entering the city, you forgot us; now that you are old and retired, you remember us again, bringing us rice, flour, clothes, and blankets to visit us." Hearing these words, it felt like a heavy stone was pressing on our hearts, and the women's eyes turned red.

After returning to Jinan, we specially reported our impressions of revisiting Mount Yi to the leaders of Shandong Province. Soon, we heard that the provincial governor had taken a working group to the old revolutionary base of Mount Yi to conduct investigations and help the local people find ways to develop the economy and improve their lives.

The natural conditions in the Mount Yi area are not ideal, with high mountains, many rocks, and little water. However, in some river valleys, hilly areas, and small plains, historically, apart from producing various grains, they also produced large quantities of peanuts, soybeans, cotton, and other economic crops. The slopes of the mountains were rich in persimmons, hawthorns, walnuts, oak silkworms, and medicinal herbs. Wild jujubes, not just a delight for children, are also a valuable medicinal herb. In some places, lifting a stone slab reveals a pile of scorpions. Dried whole scorpions are as valuable as the toad from Guangxi and the toad from Northeast China. On the banquet table, a dish of fried whole scorpions costs more than a bowl of braised sea cucumber. This is just the surface resources; as for what mineral treasures lie beneath the mountains and rivers, it is still unknown. More than ten years ago, a large diamond that shocked the nation was discovered there. The reserves of gold sand are also considerable. Gold panning was once a traditional sideline in some places.

On this piece of land that has made great sacrifices and contributions to the Chinese revolution, is it really destined to remain poor forever? Is it really necessary, as some people suggest, to relocate the population? Relocation is not easy! Where to relocate? Who will abandon this glorious land?

A sudden beam of sunset from the window interrupted my thoughts. I looked out and saw the plane flying motionless in the sky above a golden-red evening glow. The clouds below the wings, bathed in the setting sun, shimmered with dazzling colors. I calculated the flight time and realized that the plane had already crossed the Yellow River and Mount Tai. Below the clouds was the Mount Yi area that I had been thinking about.

My gaze returned to the beautifully packaged bag of peanuts in my hand. I thought that this small bag of peanuts, marked with the logo of China International Airlines, was like a plum blossom blooming in the snow, bringing news of spring. It symbolized that the people of the old revolutionary base of Mount Yi were striving to develop their economy, taking some previously unnoticed, low-value local products, processing them deeply and finely, and sending them to the nation and the world. Thinking of this, I carefully put the half-bag of peanuts into my pocket. I wanted to take them home to share my joy with my wife. My wife, like me, had also received the kindness of the people of Mount Yi. In the early 1940s, when she escaped from the Japanese occupation of Beijing to Shandong to join the revolution, her first stop was Mount Yi. It was there that she recovered from a severe case of malaria.

Back home, she was as happy as I was about the news from Mount Yi. She immediately took out a brocade box from the bookshelf, saying it was sent by an old comrade-in-arms from Linyi a few days ago, someone I hadn't seen in forty-eight years.

I opened the brocade box and found an inkstone carved from a trilobite fossil. Four trilobites that lived in the Cambrian seas five billion years ago were vividly depicted on the stone inkstone, like flying swallows. The accompanying note stated that it was produced in the Yanzi Cliff area of Mount Yi. I had been there in 1939 during an anti-sweep campaign. The cliffs and streams were filled with these prehistoric fossils, locally known as "swallow stones." Now, there is a Yanzi Cliff Art Factory that specializes in producing stationery made from trilobite fossils, such as inkstones, paperweights, pen holders, seal boxes, pen stands, and pen washers. This was another piece of news about the economic development of the old revolutionary base of Mount Yi. These trilobite fossils are precious research objects for paleontologists around the world. The stationery made from them is also a rare treasure for calligraphy enthusiasts in Japan and Southeast Asia.

Mount Yi, Mount Yi! In the era of deepening reform and opening up, you will no longer be neglected. Now, roads are gradually becoming more accessible, and the Yanzhou-Shizhuang Railway has passed through your territory. What you need is more talent, technology, knowledge, information, and efficient management. You will become richer year by year, moving further away from poverty.

On November 14, 1988, the two pieces of news about the old revolutionary base of Mount Yi that I received in one day made me excited and inspired, and I couldn't sleep for a long time that night.

　　沂蒙山信息
    冠西
    开完全国第五次文代会，我乘中国国际航空公司１５０号航班的波音飞机回家。从北京到杭州，空中飞行时间不过一个半小时，两位空姐推着小车，在通道里来回送物，却不下五六次之多。计：送当天的《人民日报》一次，水果汁、热咖啡等饮料三次，食品丰盛的饭盒一次。而起飞后，随着报纸首先送来的，是一袋蜂蜜花生米。
    我一边看报，一边随意嚼着这香甜松脆的花生米。后来，忽然想起，这不就是人们提到的那袋花生米吗？于是就注意起它来。这袋花生米，重不足一两，但颗粒硕大匀净，包装考究，其精美程度不亚于时兴的那些舶来品。在彩色塑袋的正面，印的是中国国际航空公司的标记和中英文对照的公司名称、产品名称，衬以蜜蜂天使和花朵、蜂巢的图案；背面印的是产品介绍之类的文字，也是中英文对照。看到最后，一行小字——“山东省临沂市罐头厂制造”，赫然映入眼帘。我不由自主地“啊”了一声，原来这是沂蒙老革命根据地的产品！
    在这九千米的高空，这袋花生米，不禁使我联想起，三年前和《大众日报》一些老同志重访沂蒙时的情景。
    那时，八十高龄的老社长匡亚明同志，站在一座破旧的石砌小屋前，心情沉重地说：“１９３８年年底的一个晚上，《大众日报》创刊号的清样，我就是在这小屋的油灯下看的。那时候，老房东这小屋，还有一条木头的门槛。你们看，现在连那条门槛也没有了。我们怎么对得起老区的乡亲父老们！”
    这个小山村叫云头峪。给我们的印象是，外观几乎还是四十多年前的模样。石屋，矮墙，高低不平的土路，村头的小空场边，依旧闲置着那座古老的碾盘——这小空场是当年开饭和开会的地方。这山村和原先不相同的是，不少石屋更破旧了。屋里的情景，真用得上“家徒四壁”这句成语。山上的树木和小灌木丛，几乎全消失了，只剩下裸露的岩石和沙砾。村边的小溪，不知从何年何月起就干涸了，吃一担水，要上下五里路去挑。
    就是这些小山村，当年驻扎过山东抗日根据地的最高党政军领导机关和部队。在那些烽火连天的艰苦岁月中，这里的乡亲们用小米、高粱、地瓜干养活过我们；在反扫荡中，拚着性命掩护过我们；在解放战争中，他们抬着担架，推着小车，把解放大军一直送到江南。可是战争胜利以后，几十年来，他们过的竟是这等穷苦的生活。难怪他们又是埋怨又是欢喜地对我们说：“打鬼子打老蒋，你们靠着俺；进了城，你们忘了俺；如今上了年纪、离了休，又想起了俺，还带着米面、衣被来看看俺。”听着这些话，心里都像压上了光山上那些大石头，女同志的眼圈都红了。
    回到济南以后，我们专门向山东省的领导同志说了重访沂蒙的观感。不久，听说省长同志就带着工作组去沂蒙老区进行了考察，帮助老区人民寻求开发经济改革生活的门路。
    沂蒙地区的自然条件是差了点，山高、石头多、水少。但在一些河谷地带，丘岭地区，小平原上，历史上除了盛产各类粮食以外，还出产大量的花生、大豆、棉花等经济作物。各处山坡上，则盛产柿子、山楂、核桃、柞蚕、药材等等山货。漫山野生的酸枣，不只是孩子们的恩物，酸枣仁还是一种贵重的药材。在有些地方，一掀石板，就是一大堆蝎子。干制全蝎和广西的蛤蚧、东北的蛤斯蟆同样值钱。在宴席上，一碟油炸全蝎的价钱超过一盆清炖海参。这还是地面上的物产，至于山野河流的下面，到底蕴藏着多少矿产珍宝，还是个未知数。十多年前，震惊全国的一颗大钻石就是在那里被发现的。沙金的蕴藏量也是很可观的。淘金业曾是一些地方的传统副业。
    在这样一块对中国革命做出过巨大牺牲和贡献的土地上，难道真的就命定要一直穷下去吗？难道真的要像有的人所设想的，非移民不可吗？移民，谈何容易！移向何方？把这块光荣的土地抛弃给谁？
    舷窗外突然射来的一束夕阳，打断了我的沉思。我向窗处望去，飞机正在一片金红色的晚霞上空静止不动似地飞行。机翼下变幻着的云层，在夕阳的照射下，闪耀着绚烂的色彩。我计算了一下航行的时间，飞机已经越过了黄河、泰山，云层下面，正是我在思念着的沂蒙山区。
    我的目光又回到了手中那袋包装精美的花生米上。我想，这印着中国国际民航标记的小小一袋花生米，正像冰雪中绽开的梅朵，透露出了春的消息。它标志着沂蒙老区人民，正在努力开发自己的经济，把一些原先不起眼、不值钱的土特产品，经过深加工、精加工，让它飞向全国，飞向世界。想到这里，我把这半袋花生米，小心地装进了衣袋，我要带回家，让老伴分享我的喜悦。我的老伴，同样受过沂蒙人民的恩惠。四十年代初，当她逃离日寇铁蹄下的北平，来山东参加革命时，第一站到的就是沂蒙。她染上的很重的疟疾，也是在那里医好的。
    回到家里，她对这来自沂蒙的信息，果然像我同样的高兴。并且立刻从书橱里捧出一只锦盒，说这是前几天你的一位分别了四十八年的老战友，从临沂托人带来的。
    我打开锦盒一看，原来是一方用三叶虫化石琢磨而成的砚台。四只生存在五亿年前寒武纪海洋里的三叶虫，像飞舞着的燕子，栩栩如生地突现在石砚上，令人爱不释手。说明书上标明，它产于沂蒙山区的燕子崖。这地方，１９３９年反扫荡时我去过。山崖边、溪流里，随处都能找到这种当地称为“燕子石”的史前生物化石。现在，这里已经办起了一座燕子石工艺厂，专门生产以三叶虫化石为原料的砚台、镇纸、笔架、印泥盒、笔筒、笔洗等文房用品。这真是无独有偶，又是一个沂蒙老区的经济正在得以开发的信息。这种三叶虫化石，对于世界各国的古生物学家来说，都是珍贵的研究对象。用它所制成的文具，对日本、东南亚国家的书法爱好者来说，同样是难得的珍品。
    沂蒙山，沂蒙山！在改革开放日益深化的年代里，你再也不会被冷落了。如今，公路正逐渐四通八达，兖石铁路已穿过你的腹地。你所需要的，是更多的人才，科技，知识，信息和有效率的管理。你是会一年比一年远离贫困而富裕起来的。
    １９８８年１１月１４日，在一天中所偶然得到的两个关于沂蒙老区的信息，使我振奋，鼓舞，夜里久久不能成寐。
