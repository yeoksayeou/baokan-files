The Japanese scholar Itakura Juro in his book "Aesthetics of Clothing" points out: "All clothing phenomena have 'appreciation' interwoven within them." This means that the use value and aesthetic value of a piece of clothing must be realized through the wearer's act of wearing and the appreciation of others. Consumers, for clothing designers, are the objects of clothing aesthetics. A piece of clothing, before being worn, has many "blank spots," which can only be filled through the specific act of wearing by the receiver. In other words, a piece of clothing can only display its beauty or ugliness when worn by a living person, combined with their appearance and inner qualities, and when they move around.

The same piece of clothing, when worn by different people, can present different, even opposite, aesthetic effects. Dior in his book "Christian Dior and I" writes: "Every woman imparts her own personality to the clothes she wears. The same dress worn by Marie and worn by Chatelaine are not the same dress. A set of tramp-like clothing, when worn by a taxi driver and when worn by a university professor, will naturally produce completely different effects." Because in the act of wearing, not only the functional meaning of the clothing is contained, but also the aesthetic meaning, including the sensory creative content. Wearing a black outfit to a funeral and wearing it to an academic conference (recently, black wedding dresses have been popular abroad for brides to wear during wedding ceremonies), the psychological messages conveyed are fundamentally different. Due to different purposes of wearing, the same clothing expresses different moods and creates different beautiful images.

Another principle of reception aesthetics is "fusion of horizons," which means that only when the reader's expected horizon and the original meaning of the literature are fused, can there be reception and understanding. For a clothing designer, he should always consider the issue of "fusion of horizons," that is, pay attention to researching the consumer's aesthetic psychological needs and changes, and frequently communicate with them. Because the consumer's expected horizon is not fixed, but changes with the times. Only by fusing the consumer's expected horizon with clothing design can the designer's various innovative efforts have the possibility of success. The phrase "appeal to their tastes" is, if we remove the meaning of catering to some low-level tastes, then the content of the consumer's "tastes" and its changing trends are worth our serious study. Only by constantly appealing to the consumer's tastes can clothing design continue to have the vitality of life.

The aesthetic value of clothing is jointly created by the designer, the wearer, and the appreciator. Therefore, the feedback from the appreciator is also crucial. Attending an important event, what to wear and how to dress up, has a certain significance as a public performance, and can also be seen as a dialogue between the wearer and the receiver. Therefore, if a wearer has a bit of the concept of reception aesthetics, then when choosing their clothing, they will not only consider their own preferences but also consider the preferences of the receiver. For example, artists performing at the front lines of Laoshan should not dress too flashy; while a primary school teacher attending a friend's wedding does not need to dress exactly the same as in the classroom. The reason behind this is that it varies with the person—it varies with the object of clothing aesthetics.

　　服饰的接受美学
    唐全贤
    日本学者板仓寿郎在《服饰美学》一书中指出：“一切服饰现象都有‘观赏’介于其中。”这就是说，一件服装的使用价值和审美价值，必须经过消费者的穿着活动、第三者的欣赏，才能得以实现。消费者对于服装设计师来说，就是服饰美的接受对象。一件服装在未经穿着前，有许多“空白点”，只有经过接受主体的穿着这一具体化的活动，这些空白才能得到填补。也就是说，一件衣服唯有让一个活生生的人穿在身上，和他的外形、内在气质相结合，并且活生生地走动起来，才能展现其美与丑。
    同样一件衣服，穿在不同的人的身上，呈现出来的服饰美，可能是不同的，甚至是相反的。迪奥尔在《克里斯蒂昂·奥迪尔和我》一书中写道：“每个妇女都赋予自己所穿着的衣服以个性。设计相同的衣服，穿在玛丽身上和穿在沙特尔身上，就不成其为相同的服装了。一套流浪汉式的服装，穿在一个的士司机身上和穿在一位大学教授身上，所取得的效果自然是完全不同的。”因为在穿着时，不仅含有服饰的功能的意义，更包含着审美的意义，包含着感性的创造内容。穿一身黑色的衣服去参加葬礼与一次学术会议（前些时国外时兴新娘在举行婚礼时也穿黑色礼服），其传达的心理则根本不同。由于穿着目的不同，同一的衣服表达出了不同的心情，也创造出了不同的美的形象。
    接受美学的另一条原则是“视野融合”，即只有读者的期待视野与文学本义相融合，才谈得上接受和理解。对于一位服装设计师来说，他应时时考虑到“视野融合”问题，即注重研究消费者的审美心理的需要和变化，和他们经常进行交流。因为消费者的期待视野并不是一成不变的，而是随时代的变化而不断变化的。只有把消费者的期待视野和服装设计相融合，服装设计师的各种创新的努力才有可能取得成功。“投其所好”这句话，如果除去其中迎合某些低级趣味的含义，那么，消费者的“所好”的内容及其变化的势态，是值得我们认真加以研究的。唯有不断投消费者之好，服装设计才会不断有生命的活力。
    服装的审美价值是由设计者、穿着者和鉴赏者共同创造的。因此，鉴赏者的反馈也至关重要。出席一次重要活动，穿什么服装，如何修饰，具有一定意义的当众表演的特点，也可以看作是穿着者和接受者的一种对话。因此，对于穿着者来说，如果有一点接受美学观念，那么，他在选择自己的服饰时，就不仅考虑到自己的爱好，而且也会考虑到接受对象的喜好。比如文艺工作者到老山前线作慰问演出，穿得花枝招展就不甚适宜；而一位小学教师参加朋友的婚礼，就不必与课堂上穿着一模一样。其中的原委，就是因“人”而异——因服饰美的接受对象不同而异。
