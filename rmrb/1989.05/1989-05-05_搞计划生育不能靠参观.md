Title: Family Planning Cannot Rely on Visits

Family planning in China cannot rely on visits alone. The counties of Fu Yu and Ke Shan in Heilongjiang Province are known for their advanced family planning work. The Publicity Department and the State Family Planning Commission have both promoted their experiences, and many newspapers have reported on them in detail.

Originally, this was a good thing. However, after the newspapers reported on it, the family planning work in these two counties almost collapsed. Visitors and learners came in droves. From last August to now, the two counties have received visitors from 19 provinces, 23 cities, and 64 counties across the country, totaling over 7,000 people. The costs for meals and transportation have exceeded 30,000 yuan. The visiting units also spent a lot of money. A county from the interior sent 11 people, and the travel expenses alone amounted to 20,000 yuan. Not to mention that, because they were busy with reception work all day, a family planning cadre in a model town in Ke Shan County had no time to attend to daily work, resulting in 90 cases of out-of-plan births.

According to the report on page five of your newspaper on May 3, the city of Cheng Guan in Wang Pang County, Sichuan Province, could not secure 5,000 yuan for activities, causing the family planning work to be unable to proceed. It seems that the funds for family planning work are quite tight. Under such financial constraints, a large number of family planning cadres are still traveling south and north, busy with visits and learning. Anyone with a bit of common sense knows that family planning work has neither spectacular scenes nor "learn it once and master it" moments. It is built on the basis of raising the awareness of the masses to voluntarily have only one child. As long as you do in-depth and detailed work, you will definitely see some results, and there is no need to travel thousands of miles to visit.

If family planning work could really be done well by visiting, then China's population would not have exceeded 1.1 billion. The visitors to Fu Yu and Ke Shan probably have other intentions. Look at the map: near Fu Yu and Ke Shan are the Jing Po Lake tourist area and the Zhalong Nature Reserve (the land of cranes), and along the way, you can also see the scenery of the Xing'an Mountains.

If visits continue like this, China's population will indeed explode.

### 搞计划生育不能靠参观

　　搞计划生育不能靠参观
    黑龙江省的富裕、克山两县是计划生育工作的先进县，中宣部、国家计生委曾转发了该县的经验，许多报纸也作了详细报道。
    本来这是一件好事，岂料，报纸一宣传，这两个县的计划生育工作差一点要冲垮了。参观、学习者成群结队而来，从去年８月到现在，这两县已接待来自全国１９个省，２３个地市，６４个县的参观者，人数已超过７０００人。接待用去的饭费、车费已超过３万元。参观的客方单位耗资也很多，关内一个县１１人来一趟的旅差费就花去两万元。这还不说，因整天忙于接待工作，克山县有个先进镇的计划生育干部无暇顾及日常工作，出现了９０例计划外生育。
    据５月３日贵报五版报道：四川省旺苍县城关镇因５００元活动费落实不了，致使计划生育工作无法开展，看来计划生育工作的经费是相当紧张的。在经费如此短缺的情况下，大批计生干部还南来北往忙于参观学习。稍有点常识的人都知道，计划生育工作既无轰轰烈烈的场面，也无“一学就会”的镜头，它是建立在群众觉悟提高的基础上自觉只生一孩。你只要深入细致地做工作，总会收到一些效果，根本不必千里迢迢去参观。
    如果真要是靠参观能把计划生育工作做好，那现在中国的人口决不会超过１１亿。去富裕、克山的参观者恐怕“醉翁之意不在酒”，请看地图：富裕、克山附近有镜泊湖旅游区、齐齐哈尔扎龙自然保护区（鹤乡），沿途还可以看到兴安岭的风光。
    如此参观下去，中国人口真要爆炸了。
