Jarosław Kaczyński visited East Germany and signed a treaty on the border division of the Oder Lagoon. The treaty between the German Democratic Republic and Poland on the border division of the Oder Lagoon was formally signed in Berlin on May 22nd. The foreign ministers of the two countries, Fischer and Orzechowski, signed the treaty on behalf of their respective governments. Honecker and Jaruzelski attended the signing ceremony. The signing of this treaty resolves a long-standing dispute between the two countries.

The dispute over the border division of the Oder Lagoon arose after Poland and East Germany declared their 12-nautical-mile territorial waters in 1977 and 1984, respectively.

Jarosław Kaczyński arrived in East Germany's capital, Berlin, yesterday for a one-day friendly visit. During the visit, the two sides also signed documents on cultural cooperation between the two countries until the year 2000 and on cooperation in the social sciences between the two parties from 1990 to 1995.
