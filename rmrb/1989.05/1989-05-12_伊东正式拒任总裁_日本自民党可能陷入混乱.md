Ito Formally Declines Party Presidency
Japan's LDP May Face Chaos

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 12 - Correspondent Yu Qing reports: At the request of Prime Minister Takeshita, Secretary-General Abe, who was entrusted with mediating the succession of the LDP president, formally asked Ito Seishi to take the position this afternoon. Ito formally declined. In the subsequent meeting of the LDP executive committee, Ito remained adamant in his refusal and stated that if his refusal was not understood, he would resign from his position as a Diet member.

The LDP executive committee will make a final effort tomorrow to persuade Ito.

Ito's formal reasons for declining are:
1. Lack of confidence in his own health, fearing that he might fall ill during diplomatic activities, causing negative impacts on the country;
2. Differences in views on political reform with other executives, making it difficult to gain national understanding and acceptance in the current political situation.

Commentators believe that Ito's main condition is that LDP power figures involved in the Recruit stock scandal should first resign from their Diet seats. However, there is significant resistance within the LDP to this.

If Ito insists on declining at tomorrow's LDP executive committee meeting, there will be no choice but to find another candidate. However, currently, aside from Ito, there is no one who commands widespread support. Finding a new candidate may plunge the LDP into a state of chaos.

　　伊东正式拒任总裁    
    日本自民党可能陷入混乱
    本报东京５月１２日电  记者于青报道：受竹下首相委托斡旋自民党继任总裁的安倍干事长，今天下午正式要求伊东正义出任，遭到伊东正式拒绝。在随即召开的自民党干部会议上，伊东仍然坚辞不受，并表示如果他的拒绝不能得到理解，就辞去国会议员职务。
    自民党干部会议明天将作最后努力，以说服伊东。
    伊东正式提出的拒绝理由是：１、对自己的健康状况没有自信，担心在外交活动中病倒，给国家造成影响；２、有关政治改革的看法，与其他干部有不同认识，如此受任，无法取得国民理解。在现在的政治状况中，不能接任。
    评论家认为，伊东的主要条件具体地说是，涉嫌利库路特股票丑闻的自民党实力人物应该首先辞去国会议员职务。而自民党内对此阻力极大。
    在明天的自民党干部会议上如果伊东坚持不受，只有另物色人选。但目前除伊东外尚无众望所归的人物。重新物色人选，可能使自民党陷入混乱状态。
