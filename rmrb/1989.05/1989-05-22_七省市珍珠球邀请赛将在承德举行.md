The Seventh Provincial and Municipal Pearl Ball Invitational Tournament will be held in Chengde. Teams from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin, totaling 27 men's and women's teams, will participate in the competition.

Pearl Ball is a sport that the Manchu people greatly enjoy. Its playing style is somewhat similar to basketball and handball. To enrich the sports life of ethnic minorities, the State Sports Commission and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission agreed to hold a large-scale competition in the historic and cultural city of Chengde. Through this competition, the rules will be further improved and standardized, making it an official event in the National Minorities Games. To make this competition a grand event of ethnic unity, the Chengde Regional Sports Commission, the Regional Ethnic Affairs Commission, and the Economic News have invested significant efforts in preparation.

　　七省市珍珠球邀请赛将在承德举行
    本报讯  ７省市珍珠球邀请赛，即将在承德举行，来自辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古、河北、北京、天津的２７支男女队将参加角逐。
    珍珠球是满族人民十分喜爱的体育项目，其打法既有点像篮球，又有点像手球。为了丰富少数民族的体育生活，国家体委和国家民委同意在文化历史名城承德举办一次规模较大的比赛。通过比赛，进一步完善、统一规则，使其成为全国民族运动会正式比赛项目。为了使这次比赛成为一次民族团结的盛会，承德地区体委和地区民委以及经济消息报已投入较大的力量作准备。
