World Bank Report Says Developing Countries Show Two Economic Trends

	New China News Agency, Washington, May 14 — Since entering the 1980s, the economic development of developing countries has shown two distinct trends—some regions have seen rapid increases in per capita income, while others have seen declines.

	According to a recent report by the World Bank, during the period from 1967 to 1980, the per capita income in Asia and Latin America both increased by about 100 percent. However, in the 1980s, the per capita income in Asia increased by 60 percent, while in Latin American countries, it showed a declining trend. In sub-Saharan Africa, excluding Nigeria, per capita income also declined by 15 percent.

	The report attributes these differences to natural conditions, historical backgrounds, and differing policies. For Latin American countries, the decline in per capita income is closely related to their massive external debts.

	In terms of trade, South Asia and East Asia had the same share of world export trade as Latin America in 1967. However, by 1987, the former's share was three times that of the latter. The export trade volume of China compared to India also showed a similar situation. In 1967, China's export volume was $2.1 billion, while India's was $1.6 billion. But by 1987, China's export volume had grown to $39.5 billion, while India's was only $12.5 billion.

	The report points out that the ratio of the total export volume of developing countries to that of developed countries was 0.33 to 1 in 1977. However, in the 1980s, this ratio showed a decline.

　　世界银行一份报告认为    
    发展中国家经济出现两种趋势
    新华社华盛顿５月１４日电  进入８０年代以来，发展中国家的经济发展出现了两种截然不同的趋势-有的地区人均收入迅速上升，有的地区人均收入有所下降。
    据世界银行最近发表的一份报告说，在１９６７年至１９８０年期间，亚洲和拉美地区的人均收入都分别增加了１倍，但是进入８０年代后，亚洲地区的人均收入增长了６０％，而拉美国家的人均收入却呈下降趋势。非洲撒哈拉以南地区除尼日利亚外，人均收入也下降了１５％。
    报告认为，自然条件、历史背景以及政策不同是造成这种差别的原因。对拉美国家来说，人均收入下降与巨额外债有密切关系。
    从贸易情况看，南亚、东亚在１９６７年时在世界出口贸易中所占比重与拉美国家相等，但是到１９８７年时，前者比后者高３倍。中国的出口贸易额与印度相比也出现类似状况。１９６７年时，中国的出口额为２１亿美元，印度为１６亿美元，但１９８７年中国的出口额增长到３９５亿美元，而印度只有１２５亿美元。
    报告指出，发展中国家与发达国家的出口总额比率，在１９７７年为０．３３比１，但到了８０年代，这个比率有所下降。
