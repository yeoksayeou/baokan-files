	Two shores separated by the strait for 40 years. Last April, the Taiwan authorities allowed citizens to visit the mainland. In an instant, countless letters filled with longing and separation sorrow flew to the mainland before the children returned home. After 40 springs, summers, autumns, and winters, are the elderly parents still alive? Has the wife changed her heart? Has the old home been moved? One letter after another, carrying a heart full of anxiety, flew in like snowflakes!

	In just one year, more than a million letters have been sent from Taiwan to the mainland. Beijing Post Office alone has handled 580,000 letters from Taiwan, with 48,000 in the Beijing area. However, due to the long-term separation between the two sides of the strait, as well as changes in place names and population movements, many letters, after being delivered again and again, became "dead letters." According to the usual practice, stamping "No Such Person" on the "dead letters" and returning them would not be criticized. But the delivery personnel of Beijing Post Office poured their hearts into it, using every means to help Taiwanese citizens find their relatives.

	“I never expected my father to still be alive”

	On June 5 last year, the office of Wan Shou Road Post Office in Beijing was quiet. The director held a returned "dead letter" and asked everyone, "Is there any way?" The nearly 60-year-old delivery worker, Ye Kuan, took the letter from the director and looked at it: "Mainland Beijing, outside Xizhimen, Princess Tomb, New Beijing Railway Station. 40 years ago, Liu Dehai's third daughter Liu Mingying's son Zheng Zhengping. From Hong Kong, Zheng Boshun." From experience, Ye Kuan knew this letter came from Taiwan. Seeing the three generations and three names of the addressees on the envelope, he knew that the writer and the addressee had been separated for many years and were eager to find each other. He said to the director, "Let me try to find it!"

	Ye Kuan, who had been working in the post office for more than 30 years, began to ponder: "Outside Xizhimen, Princess Tomb, New Beijing Railway Station." According to Ye Kuan's knowledge, there has never been a railway station outside Xizhimen, but there used to be a railway station near Princess Tomb. During the War of Resistance, "New Beijing," which is now Wan Shou Road, was once a Japanese barracks. The Japanese army built a railway from "New Beijing" to Qianmen for the convenience of their families, and the station was near Princess Tomb. Ye Kuan guessed that "Xizhimen" might be a mistake for Xibianmen. He then took the letter to ask old neighbors. Before liberation, Wan Shou Road was a desolate area, and this address with errors and no door number was extremely difficult to deliver. Surprisingly, three days later in the evening, Ye Kuan found the addressee Liu Mingying and her son Zheng Zhengping.

	Liu Mingying had been separated from her husband for 40 years. When she held her husband's handwritten letter, she was extremely excited. Zheng Zhengping saw his mother's state and quickly comforted her. After reading his father's letter, this man who had suffered the pain of having no father since childhood said to Ye Kuan with tears, "I never expected my father to still be alive. My mother said that I was 4 months old when my father went to Taiwan, and for decades, I didn't know whether he was alive or dead. I am 40 years old, and this is the first time I have read a letter from my father. Ye, I really don't know how to thank you!" "No need to thank, no need to thank!" Ye Kuan also said excitedly, "It's good that we found it. Quickly contact your father!" The next day, Zheng Zhengping wrote a letter to his father. On July 21, Mr. Zheng Boshun, who was in his 70s, returned to the mainland to visit relatives. The whole family specially went to Wan Shou Road Post Office to thank Ye Kuan and presented the post office with a carved shell, inscribed with "Wan Shou Road Post Office and Green-Clad Angels, 40 Years of Crane Letters and Iron Shoes."

	“I love this delivery job”

	In the late 1970s, letters from Taiwanese citizens looking for relatives began to increase, sent from the United States and Japan. In September 1982, Li Jinyou, who was then working at Xichang'an Street Post Office, found a returned letter from Japan. The address on the envelope was "Faxian Hutong 22," and the addressees were Xu Huifen, Xu Huipure, and Xu Yize. He estimated that this was a letter from Taiwan looking for relatives and decided to find it carefully. Li Jinyou is an "old Beijing" and knew that Faxian Hutong had been demolished when the Great Hall of the People was built. He then took the letter to ask old residents in Gaobeidian Hutong. Once, he heard from an elderly person that the Xu family had been a large courtyard, and outsiders rarely talked to the Xu family members; after liberation, he saw Xu Huifen buy vegetables. Li Jinyou thought: Since she bought vegetables, she must still be in Beijing. He then used his rest time to run to the neighborhood committee, police station, and public security bureau, checking household registers, archives, and relocation registration cards one by one. At that time, many people were afraid to be involved with overseas relatives, and Li Jinyou encountered many cold looks and said many good words. Finally, he found in the Xichang'an Street police station that the Xu family had moved to Erlong Road Jia 13. He went to Erlong Road and asked, but Jia 13 had no such person, and the clue he had found with great difficulty was broken again!

	At this time, Li Jinyou was afraid that the person who sent the letter from Japan would not wait, so he paid for a letter to the sender explaining the situation and asking her to wait patiently. Soon, Li Jinyou received a letter from a Miss Xu Xiaoya. She was extremely grateful to Li Jinyou and hoped that he would continue to help her find her relatives.

	Li Jinyou read the letter and thought of many things. He thought, over the years, he had delivered countless "dead letters," and this time he must not let the Taiwanese citizen who sent the letter be disappointed. He then went to the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's household registration office to find the addressee Xu Huifen among dozens of people with the same name, and later found another addressee Xu Yize on Jinding Street, allowing the Xu family to contact their relatives who had been in Taiwan for decades. After communicating for five years, in January 1988, Xu Xiaoya's father, Mr. Xu Huiwen, returned to the mainland to visit relatives and wrote a moving letter to Liu Pingyuan, the director of Beijing Post Office: "I went to Taiwan with the army via Shanghai in 1948, separating from my hometown Beijing Sanjia Garden and relatives on both sides of the strait, and spent nearly 40 years in longing and sorrow... On January 9, I returned to Beijing and reunited with dozens of relatives, and this kindness and virtue are all thanks to the director's daily requirements, training, education, and leadership of the subordinates, as well as Li Jinyou's enthusiastic service and dedication to duty."

	Li Jinyou can be called the "dead letter" champion. In the past three years alone, he has helped more than 30 Taiwanese citizens find hundreds of relatives on the mainland. Li Jinyou told me that the postal workers' delivery of "dead letters" is all done during their spare time and public holidays, and going to the police station and public security bureau to check archives is also an "extra job," and no one has ever received bonuses or overtime pay for it.

	“For the early communication between the two sides of the strait”

	On the evening of April 16 this year, a large passenger plane from Hong Kong landed smoothly at Beijing Capital Airport. Before the passengers got off the plane, Li Qiujun, a delivery worker from Guang'anmen Post Office, and his apprentice were already waiting at the two exits of the waiting hall. They called out Mr. Zhang Guowei's name one after another. When Mr. Zhang Guowei from Taiwan met several of his brothers, who he had been separated from for more than 40 years, and more than 40 relatives from the mainland at the airport, he said to his brother with tears in his eyes, "If it weren't for Guang'anmen Post Office's Li Qiujun, we might not have met in this lifetime."

	In August 1987, Li Qiujun found a "dead letter" that had been tried to be delivered at five sub-offices, with six addressees, including Zhang Guorong. Li Qiujun found the delivery worker in his office and asked him to try to deliver it again. This delivery worker tried to deliver it again and said, "Qiujun, it really can't be found. Look, this letter was mistakenly opened by a son of a person named Zhang Guirong!" Li Qiujun took the letter and saw it clearly: Right! First, find this Zhang Guirong.

	After work, Li Qiujun eagerly came to Zhang's house, but this Zhang Guirong only apologized to his son for mistakenly opening the letter and knew nothing about Zhang Guorong. Holding this letter, Li Qiujun thought, the sender must be eager to contact their relatives on the mainland! No matter what, it cannot be returned!

	In more than half a month of spare time and public holidays, Li Qiujun visited nearby neighbors and went to the neighborhood committee and several police stations to check household registration archives. One day, Li Qiujun found Zhang Guorong in the thickly dust-covered household registration archives. He immediately rushed to Zhang Guorong's house in the rain. But this elderly man in his 70s did not dare to accept this letter for a long time. Li Qiujun held the letter with both hands and said to the old man, "Grandpa, this might be a letter from your relatives in Taiwan. Please take a look at the six addressees' names." The old man took the letter and saw that in addition to himself, there were also five other brothers' names. He cried and said, "Is this written by my seventh brother?" He opened it and saw that the sender was indeed his seventh brother Zhang Guowei, whom he had been separated from for 40 years. The old man thanked Li Qiujun over and over again and insisted on inviting Li Qiujun to dinner. Li Qiujun, who was already very hungry, said, "Grandpa, I'm not hungry. Please tell this good news to your brothers!" Before leaving, Li Qiujun also told the old man to dispel his worries and contact his relatives in Taiwan as soon as possible. In the more than a year before Mr. Zhang Guowei returned, he communicated with his brothers on the mainland almost once a week. Mr. Zhang returned to the mainland to visit relatives, and Li Qiujun also helped with accommodation and other matters.

	In recent years, Li Qiujun has eliminated more than 4,200 various "dead letters." Facing more and more letters from Taiwanese citizens, with the support of leaders and comrades, Li Qiujun and his two apprentices formed the "Dead Letter Elimination Team." Li Qiujun said with deep feelings, "Delivering dead letters is indeed bitter, but there is also joy in bitterness. For the early reunion of compatriots on both sides of the strait, as long as there is one percent hope for a dead letter, we are willing to put in 200 percent effort!" Li Qiujun's words expressed the voice of postal workers and also spoke out the wish of compatriots on both sides of the strait, who have been separated for 40 years, to communicate early.

　　两岸飞鸿架桥人
    ——北京邮政局投递台胞“死信”的故事
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    大陆台湾，一水相隔４０载。去年４月，台湾当局允许百姓赴大陆探亲。一时间，多少洒满相思泪、倾诉离别愁的书信纷纷在游子归来前飞往大陆。４０个春夏秋冬，高堂父母是否健在？结发妻子是否易弦？老家宅院是否搬家？一封封家书带着一颗颗灼热而又焦虑的心像雪片似地飞来！
    短短一年，台湾寄来大陆的信件已逾百万件。仅北京市邮政局处理的台湾信件就达５８万件。其中，北京地区４．８万件。然而，由于海峡两岸长期阻隔，加之地名变更，人员流动等多种原因，许多信经过一投再投变成了“死信”。按常规，将“死信”打个“查无此人”邮戳退回，也无可指责。但北京市邮政局的投递员们，倾注了满腔深情，千方百计为台胞寻亲人。
  “没想到我爸爸还活着”
    去年６月５日，北京市万寿路邮局办公室一片寂静。局长拿着一封已批退的“死信”问大家：“还有办法吗？”年近六旬的投递员叶堃从局长手里拿过信一看：“大陆北京西直门外公主坟新北京火车站４０年前刘德海之三女刘明英之子郑正平收”。下款是“香港郑伯勋”。凭经验，叶堃知道这封信来自台湾，再看信封上的三代三个收信人姓名，说明写信人与收信人离散多年又急于找寻的心情。他对局长说：“让我去找找看！”
    在邮局干了三十多年投递工作的叶堃，拿着这封“死信”琢磨开了：“西直门外公主坟新北京火车站。”据叶堃所知，“西直门外”从来没有火车站，公主坟附近倒曾有过火车站。抗战期间，“新北京”即现在的万寿路一带，曾是日本兵营。日军为方便家属进城，修了一条从“新北京”至前门的火车道，车站就在公主坟附近。叶堃据此推测，“西直门”可能是西便门之误。于是，他拿着信到处找老街坊打听。解放前，万寿路是一片荒郊，这地址书写错误且又无门牌号的信按说极难投递。令人惊讶的是，三天之后的傍晚，叶堃竟找到了收信人刘明英和她的儿子郑正平。
    刘明英与丈夫离散４０年，当她拿着丈夫的亲笔信时激动万分。郑正平见状急忙劝慰母亲。他拆看完父亲的来信后，这个从小饱受“没爸爸”痛楚的汉子流着泪对叶堃说：“没想到我爸爸还活着。听母亲说生下我４个月父亲就去了台湾，几十年生死不明。活了４０岁，我才第一次读到父亲的来信，叶师傅，真不知该怎么谢你！”
    “不谢不谢！”叶堃也激动地说：“找到就好了，快和你父亲联系吧！”第二天，郑正平就给父亲回了信。７月２１日，古稀之年的郑伯勋先生回大陆探亲，全家人特地到万寿路邮局感谢叶堃，并送给邮局一个贝雕，上书“万寿路邮局长官暨绿衣天使，四十年鸿雁踏铁鞋”。
  “我爱的就是投递这一行”
    七十年代后期，辗转从美国、日本寄来的台胞寻亲信逐年增多。１９８２年９月，尚在西长安街邮局工作的李金友发现一封批退的日本来信，信封上的地址是“法宪胡同２２号”，收信人徐慧文、徐慧纯、徐怡泽。他估计这是封台湾寻亲信，便决定认真查找。李金友是“老北京”，知道法宪胡同早在盖人民大会堂时拆迁，他便拿着信寻访高碑胡同一带老住户。一次，偶尔从一长者嘴里得知徐家原是大宅院，外人很少跟徐家人说话；解放后，他见徐慧文买过菜。李金友想：既然她买过菜，人肯定还在北京。于是，他利用休息时间跑居委会、派出所、公安局，一本又一本地查户口簿、档案、搬迁登记卡。那年月，不少人一听海外关系都怕沾边，李金友看了不少冷眼，说了许多好话，终于在西长安街派出所查到徐家搬迁至二龙路甲１３号。他到二龙路一问，甲１３号根本无此人，好不容易查到的线索又断了！
    此时，李金友怕在日本发信的人等不急，便自费给寄信人回了封信讲明情况，请她耐心等待。很快，李金友收到了署名徐小霞小姐的回信。她万分感谢李金友，希望他继续为她寻找亲人。
    李金友读信后思绪万千。他想，多年来自己投递的“死信”数不清，这次无论如何也不能让寄信的台胞失望。于是，他一次又一次去北京市公安局户籍处查找，在几十个同名者中找到了现住西什库大街３７号的收信人徐慧文。此后，又在金鼎街找到了另一个收信人徐怡泽，使徐家与去台几十年的亲人有了联系。通信５年之后，１９８８年１月，徐小霞父亲徐会文先生从台湾回大陆探亲时，写给北京市邮政局刘平源局长一封感人肺腑的信：“本人于１９４８年随军经上海转往台湾，与故乡北京市三家园及亲人相隔于海峡两岸，悠悠度过近４０年之岁月，相思之苦楚无以言表……１月９日返抵北京与家中数十亲友重聚相逢，此恩此德皆赖局长平日对部属之要求、训练、教育、领导之丰功及李金友先生之热忱服务，忠于职守。”
    李金友堪称投“死信”状元，仅在最近三年，他就为３０多位台胞找到了大陆的几百个亲人。李金友告诉我，邮局职工投递“死信”全是利用业余时间和公休日，去派出所、公安局查阅档案也属“份外事”，从没有人为此得过奖金、加班费。
  “为了海峡两岸早日通邮”
    今年４月１６日傍晚，一架香港大型客机在北京首都机场平稳降落，未待乘客走出机舱，广安门邮局投递员李秋君和他的徒弟早已迎候在候机室的两个出口。他们一声声呼喊着张国威先生的名字。当台湾来的张国威先生在机场与离别４０余年的几位兄长和大陆的４０多位亲人见面时，眼含热泪对哥哥说：“要不是遇上广安门邮局李秋君，我们这辈子恐怕难以相见。”
    １９８７年８月，李秋君发现一封写有张国荣等６个收信人姓名、已在５个支局试投的“死信”。李秋君找到本局投递员，请他再去试投。这个投递员再次投递后说：“秋君，确实找不到。你看这信还被一个叫张桂荣的人的儿子误拆过呢！”李秋君接过信眼前一亮：对！先找找这个张桂荣。
    下班后，李秋君兴冲冲来到张家，但这个张桂荣除了对儿子误拆信件表示歉意外，对张国荣的情况一无所知。拿着这封信，李秋君想，寄信人多么急于和大陆亲人联系啊！无论如何也不能把它退回去！
    在半个多月业余时间和公休日里，李秋君遍访附近街坊邻居，还到居委会和几个派出所查户口档案。一天，李秋君从那些堆积着厚厚尘土的户口档案中查到了张国荣。他当即冒雨骑车来到张国荣家。但这位古稀老人半晌不敢认领这封信。李秋君双手捧着信对老人说：“大爷，这兴许是你台湾的亲人写的信，您仔细看看６个收信人的姓名。”老人接过信，见收信人除了自己，还有另外５个兄弟的名字。他老泪纵横地说：“这是不是老七写的呀？”打开一看，写信人果真是他分别４０年的七弟张国威。老人千恩万谢，非要留李秋君吃晚饭，早已饥肠辘辘的李秋君却说：“大爷，我不饿。您快把这好消息告诉您的几个弟弟吧！”临走，李秋君还告诉老人打消顾虑，尽快和台湾的亲人联系。在张国威先生今年回来前的一年多时间里，他与大陆的兄长几乎一个礼拜通一封信。张先生回大陆探亲，李秋君还帮助联系住宿等。
    几年来，李秋君共消灭各类“死信”４２００余封。面对越来越多的台胞信函，在领导和同志们的支持下，李秋君和他的两个徒弟成立了“消灭死信小组”。李秋君深有感触地说：“投递死信要说苦也确实苦，但苦中也有乐。为了两岸骨肉同胞早日团聚，只要有百分之一希望的死信，我们也愿付出百分之二百的努力！”李秋君的话表达了邮政职工的心声，也说出了隔绝４０年的两岸同胞盼望早日通邮的心愿。
