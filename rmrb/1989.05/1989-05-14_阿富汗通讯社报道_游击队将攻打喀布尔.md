    游击队将攻打喀布尔
    本报伊斯兰堡５月１４日电  记者任毓骏报道：据阿富汗通讯社今日消息，３万游击队士兵已在喀布尔四周集结，很快将联合向阿富汗首都喀布尔发起进攻。
    这一消息是喀布尔省游击队总司令穆罕默德·纳什接受该社记者采访时宣布的。这位游击队司令说，活动在喀布尔省的各派游击队已组成一个军事协商委员会，组织和协调各游击队的军事行动。
    另据报道，喀布尔方面声称，一周来政府军一直控制着萨朗公路，在贾拉拉巴德，政府军的反攻取得成效，扼制了游击队的进攻。政府军向游击队阵地发射了３０多枚飞毛腿导弹，炸毁了游击队的一些工事和军火库。政府军牢固地控制着贾拉拉巴德。
    又讯：游击队临时政府总统穆贾迪迪拒绝了苏联方面最近提出召开国际会议解决阿富汗问题的建议。
