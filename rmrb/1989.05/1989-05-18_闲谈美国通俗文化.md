An American scholar once said: "American popular culture is a kaleidoscopic culture. Pop songs, dances, novels, even Coca-Cola, KFC, and jeans can all be considered part of this culture."

Rambo (the main character from the movie "First Blood"), Transformers, Superman... Americans are constantly creating new images of popular culture, and these images are also shaping Americans. It's no wonder that foreigners who first arrive in the U.S. often feel confused: Is it that Americans created popular culture, or is it that popular culture created Americans? American life has become inseparable from popular culture. The dazzling array of popular culture has become a "natural resource" for the U.S., as abundant as oil, but without the competition of OPEC.

The images of American popular culture are often portrayed as all-powerful. Some people believe that if Rambo were born in another country, he wouldn't be such an invincible, wise, and brave hero. It can be said that Rambo, Transformers, and Superman are all embodiments of the American Dream.

The rise of popular culture in the U.S. is only a phenomenon of the past 30 years. In the 1950s, there was still a wall between American popular culture and high culture. When the actor who played Rambo, Sylvester Stallone, was still a child, critics referred to popular culture as mere trifles, barely worthy of attention.

In the 1960s, this wall began to crumble. The main social reasons were: 1) The influx of a large number of foreign immigrants, making the cultural structure more diverse; 2) The rapid development of science and technology, which promoted the spread of popular culture; 3) The intensification of social unrest and the changing values of the new generation, leading to a rebellion against traditional culture. The result was that high culture was strongly impacted by popular culture, and the two gradually began to merge in many aspects. High culture, or traditional culture, lost not its value, but its "aristocratic" feel. As the famous American scholar Daniel Bell said, "In the past, art was an experience; now, all experiences are becoming art."

In 1969, the U.S. established the Popular Culture Association, which now has over 3,000 members. Many universities offer courses on popular culture, and some schools even allow students to earn degrees by studying popular culture. Scholars assert that the study of popular culture has a certain foresight, as studying popular culture is essentially studying the development of modern society and its values.

Ultimately, popular culture is a product of the free market and a diverse society. The prosperity of popular culture has two prerequisites: 1) People have money to consume this culture; 2) People have time to consume this culture.

Popular culture is a culture supported by money, and it is also a culture that can "make money." A critic said that Americans listen to Jackson's records partly because his records have sold 6.9 million copies. Some people believe that popular culture attracts so many "consumers" because it is not only innocent and romantic but also stimulating. It has little political, didactic, or racial color. It does not require consumers to have specialized theoretical preparation, a high level of culture, or a particular emotion. It is the culture of the common people.

Another notable function of popular culture is that it makes it impossible to judge a person's social status based on what they wear, eat, drink, or watch. The philosopher Susan Sontag put it more bluntly: If a person only accepts high-level and serious entertainment, then they are excluding themselves from entertainment. In fact, only a fool would want to do that.

As a typical commodity culture, American popular culture is inevitably influenced by money. Sex films, hippies, slot machines, and other elements have become indispensable parts of this kaleidoscopic culture. However, scholars seem to value rational analysis more. Some insightful individuals have noted that American popular culture is rooted in the emphasis on the self. It encourages the development of individuality and a hedonistic lifestyle, creating more and more fissures with the modern organizational structure that demands diligence, self-control, rationality, and efficiency.

No country or nation's culture can be perfect, and the pursuit of perfection can sometimes hinder cultural development. In the past, many American experts and scholars held negative views of popular culture, believing it to be a destructive culture that would have a corrupting influence on American culture. However, later developments showed that the rise of popular culture not only enriched high culture, making American culture more vibrant, but also created a more democratic cultural environment. In a sense, the cultural environment that experts and scholars originally sought to achieve was realized through the development of popular culture.

### 闲谈美国通俗文化

　　闲谈美国通俗文化
    丁刚
    一位美国学者曾经说过：“美国的通俗文化是一种万花筒式的文化，流行歌曲、舞蹈、小说，甚至可口可乐、肯德基家乡鸡和牛仔裤都可以算作是这个文化的内容。”
    兰博（电影《第一滴血》主角）、变形金刚、超人……，美国人不断地塑造着新的通俗文化的形象，这些形象也在塑造着美国人。难怪初到美国的外国人常常会迷惑不解：究竟是美国人创造了通俗文化，还是通俗文化创造了美国人。美国人的生活已经和通俗文化不可分割。令人眼花缭乱的通俗文化像石油一样成了美国丰富的“自然资源”，但却没有“欧佩克”的竞争。
    美国通俗文化的形象往往是无所不能的。有人认为，假如兰博“出生”在别的什么国家，他就不会是那么一个刀枪不入、智勇双全的英雄好汉。可以说，兰博、变形金刚和超人都是美国梦的精神化身。
    通俗文化在美国的崛起不过是近３０年来的事情。５０年代，美国的通俗文化与严肃文化之间还隔着一堵墙。当扮演兰博的电影明星斯泰龙还是个孩子的时候，评论家们把通俗文化称为小玩意儿，根本不屑一顾。
    ６０年代，这堵墙开始坍塌。主要社会原因是：１、大量外国移民的涌入，使文化结构趋向于多元化；２、科学技术的迅速发展，推动了通俗文化的传播；３、社会动乱的加剧、新一代价值观念的变化造成对传统文化的反叛。其结果一方面是严肃文化受到通俗文化的强烈冲击，另一方面是两种文化逐渐在许多方面混合。严肃文化，或者说传统文化失去的不是它的价值，而是它的“贵族感”。正如美国著名学者贝尔所说，“过去艺术是一种经验，现在所有的经验都要成为艺术。”
    １９６９年，美国成立了通俗文化协会，现已有３０００多会员，不少大学开设了讲授通俗文化的课程，有的学校的学生还可以通过研究通俗文化获得学位。学者们断言，对通俗文化的研究具有一定的超前性，研究通俗文化实际上是研究现代社会及其价值观念的发展。
    说到底，通俗文化是自由市场的文化，是多样化社会的产物。通俗文化的兴盛有两个先决条件：１、人们有钱来消费这种文化；２、人们有时间来消费这种文化。
    通俗文化是靠金钱支撑的文化，通俗文化又是能“招财进宝”的文化。一位评论家说，美国人之所以要听杰克逊的唱片，部分原因是他的唱片已经销售了６９０万张。也有的人认为，通俗文化之所以能吸引众多的“消费者”，因为它不仅是天真浪漫的，而且是富有刺激的。它很少政治色彩，很少说教色彩，很少种族色彩。对消费者不要求专门的理论准备、较高的文化水平和某种特殊的感情。可以说，它是平民大众的文化。
    通俗文化的另一个显著功能是使人们无法根据一个人穿什么、戴什么、吃什么、喝什么、看什么来辨别他的社会地位。哲学家苏珊·桑塔戈说得更绝：一个人要是只接受高层次和严肃的娱乐享受，那么他就是把自己排斥在娱乐享受之外。实际上只有傻瓜才愿意这样做。
    作为典型的商品文化，美国的通俗文化当然难以摆脱金钱的影响，性电影、嬉皮士、吃角子机等都成了这种万花筒式文化的不可忽略的一部分。不过，学者们似乎更重视理性的分析。一些有识之士注意到，美国通俗文化植根于对自我的强调，它鼓励个性的发展和享乐主义的生活方式，与要求勤奋与自制、理性与效率的现代化组织结构之间出现了越来越多的裂痕。
    任何国家和民族的文化都不可能是完美无缺的，对完美无缺的追求有时反而会阻碍文化的发展。当年美国不少专家学者对通俗文化都持否定态度，认为这是一种破坏性的文化，将对美国文化产生毒化影响。但是，后来的发展表明，通俗文化的发展不仅丰富了严肃文化，使得整体的美国文化更为活跃，更重要的是也创造了一种更为民主的文化环境。从某种意义上说，专家学者们原本想要追求的那种文化环境恰恰是通过通俗文化的发展而得以实现的。　（附图片）
