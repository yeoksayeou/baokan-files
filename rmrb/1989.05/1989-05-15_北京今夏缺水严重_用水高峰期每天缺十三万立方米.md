Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 15th.

Beijing is facing a severe water shortage this summer. During the peak usage period, the city will be short by at least 130,000 cubic meters of water daily.

Today's Beijing Municipal Water Conservation Work Conference revealed that last year, Beijing's rainfall was 583.8 millimeters, 64.7 millimeters less than in 1987. The current water storage in the Guanting and Miyun reservoirs is 2.15 billion cubic meters, only 32% of their total capacity. However, last year, Beijing over-exploited groundwater by more than 200 million cubic meters, causing the groundwater level to drop, water quality in water plants to deteriorate, and supply capacity to decrease. It is reported that this year, Beijing's daily water supply capacity is only 1.18 million cubic meters, while the daily water demand during the peak usage period is expected to reach 1.65 million cubic meters. Even if the water supply capacity of the Jiuqu Water Plant Phase I project reaches 340,000 cubic meters per day after July, there will still be a daily shortage of 130,000 cubic meters.

It is understood that while calling on the entire city to do a good job in water conservation, the Beijing Municipal Government has decided to start collecting groundwater resource replenishment funds from this year, implement progressive pricing for units that exceed planned extraction from self-supplied wells, and impose fines on units and citizens who waste water.

### 北京今夏缺水严重  用水高峰期每天缺十三万立方米

　　北京今夏缺水严重    
    用水高峰期每天缺十三万立方米
    新华社北京５月１５日电（记者潘善棠）今年夏天北京市供水形势将十分严峻。在这段用水高峰期内，全市每天至少将缺水１３万立方米。
    今天召开的北京市节水工作会议提供的情况表明：去年，北京地区降水量为５８３．８毫米，比１９８７年少６４．７毫米。官厅、密云两大水库目前蓄水量共有２１．５亿立方米，仅为总蓄水能力的３２％。然而，去年，北京市地下水却超采２亿多立方米，致使地下水位下降，自来水厂水质恶化，供水能力降低。据介绍，今年北京市日供水能力只有１１８万立方米，而用水高峰期间日需水量预计将达到１６５万立方米。即使水源九厂一期工程７月后日供水能力达到３４万立方米，每日仍缺水１３万立方米。
    据了解，北京市政府在号召全市认真做好节水工作的同时，还决定从今年开始征收地下水资源养蓄基金，对单位自备井超计划开采部分实行累进加价收费，并对浪费水的单位和市民进行罚款。
