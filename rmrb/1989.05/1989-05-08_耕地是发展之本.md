Arable land is the foundation of development

Wang Xianjin

Over the past four years, China's grain production has stagnated, with one of the key reasons being the sharp reduction in arable land.

According to statistics, China's arable land area decreased by 7.5 million mu, 15 million mu, 9 million mu, and over 5 million mu in 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987 respectively, compared to the previous year. Over these four years, the net decrease in arable land totaled over 36 million mu.

If the decreased arable land had been used to plant grain, with the current average yield and replanting index, the grain production in 1985, 1986, and 1987 would have been over 500 million tons, over 300 million tons, and over 180 million tons respectively. This would have accounted for 18%, 21%, and 73% of the decrease in total grain production compared to 1984.

In reality, the annual decrease in arable land is much larger than the net decrease, as each year several hundred million mu of new arable land is reclaimed or re-cultivated to make up for some of the lost area. However, new arable land often faces more production obstacles, with soil that is not yet fertile, typically yielding 50% less per mu than mature land. Therefore, while the area has been partially compensated, the loss in production remains significant. The losses for these three years were over 150 million tons, 120 million tons, and 100 million tons respectively, accounting for 5%, 8%, and 41% of the decrease in total grain production compared to 1984.

The combined reduction in these two areas would account for 23%, 29%, and 114% of the decrease in total grain production compared to 1984. This shows the significant impact of the reduction in arable land on grain production. Conversely, if land management is strengthened and the large-scale reduction of arable land is curbed, it can have a significant impact on the development of grain production.

According to the principle of "ensuring food security and supporting construction," can we use less arable land in economic construction to ensure that the most important material foundation of agriculture, arable land, remains basically stable? This is the main issue that our land management departments are constantly considering.

In recent years, the practice of land management has proven that this is achievable. As long as we strengthen planning and management, incorporate construction land use and land development into the national economic and social development plan, on the one hand, implement planned control over construction land use, break it down layer by layer, and strictly approve the land use for each construction project; on the other hand, strengthen land development and the reclamation of idle and abandoned land to expand the area of arable land, we can control the trend of sharp reduction in arable land.

From 1985 to 1987, the country returned 28 million mu of arable land to forestry and grazing, nearly reaching the net decrease of 29 million mu of arable land over these three years. Most of the land returned to forestry and grazing has had good results, but a significant portion of the land has not been developed for forestry or grazing. If we concentrate our efforts on developing these suitable areas for forestry and grazing, develop forestry and animal husbandry, and strengthen supervision and inspection, the situation will improve. There is also great potential in non-agricultural construction land. Among the 70 construction land use projects approved by the State Land Administration, 89,000 mu of land has been saved, accounting for 10% of the applied amount. Among these, 29,000 mu of arable land has been reduced, accounting for 19% of the applied amount. Although China's arable land reserves are limited, there is still potential to be tapped. Over the three years from 1985 to 1987, 21 million mu of new arable land was added. Currently, some provinces and counties have already transitioned from a net decrease to a net increase in arable land.

For a country with 11 billion people like China, we should take the protection of arable land as an important strategic measure to break the stalemate in agricultural production and promote the long-term stable development of the national economy. This should be highly valued by all levels of leadership!

　　耕地是发展之本
    王先进
    近四年来，我国粮食生产徘徊不前，其中一个重要原因是耕地锐减。
    据统计数字，我国耕地面积１９８４年至１９８７年分别比上年净减少７５０万亩、１５００万亩、９００万亩和５００多万亩，四年累计净减少耕地３６００多万亩。
    假如减少的这些耕地，都用于播种粮食，以当前平均亩产和复种指数计算，１９８５年至１９８７年，这些耕地每年生产的粮食分别为５００多万吨、３００多万吨、１８０多万吨。分别占这三年粮食总产量比１９８４年粮食总产减少量的１８％、２１％、７３％。
    实际上，每年减少的耕地要比净减少数大得多，因为每年都要新开垦或复垦几百万亩新耕地，弥补了部分减少面积。由于新增耕地的生产障碍因素较多，土壤没有熟化，一般要比熟地亩产低５０％左右。因此，从面积来说虽然得到了部分弥补，但是产量上的损失仍然很大，这三年分别损失了１５０多万吨、１２０多万吨、１００多万吨。相当于这三年粮食总产比１９８４年粮食总产减少量的５％、８％、４１％。
    上述两项减产合计，分别相当于三年粮食总产比１９８４年粮食总产减少量的２３％、２９％、１１４％。由此可以看出，耕地减少，对粮食生产的影响有多大。反之，如果通过加强土地管理，努力抑制耕地大面积减少，也可以对粮食生产的发展产生重大作用。
    根据“一保吃饭、二保建设”的原则，能不能在经济建设中少占用耕地，以保证耕地这一农业生产最重要的物质基础基本稳定呢？这是我们土地管理部门时时考虑的主要问题。
    近年来，土地管理工作的实践证明，这是可以办到的。只要加强计划管理，把建设用地和土地开发纳入国民经济和社会发展计划，一方面对建设用地实行计划指标控制，层层分解，并严格每个建设项目用地审批；另一方面加强土地开发和闲散地、荒废地的复垦，扩大耕地面积，就能控制住耕地锐减的趋势。
    １９８５年至１９８７年的三年中，全国退耕还林还牧耕地面积达２８００万亩，已接近这三年净减耕地２９００多万亩数。多数退耕之后效果较好，但是也有相当一部分退耕之后并未搞林、草建设。如果集中力量开发这些宜林宜牧地，发展林、牧业，并加强监督检查，情况就会改观。非农业建设用地也是大有潜力可挖的。仅国家土地管理局负责审批的７０宗建设用地，就节约土地８９００亩，占申请数的１０％。其中核减耕地２９００亩，占申请数的１９％。我国耕地后备资源虽然很少，但也并不是没有潜力可挖。１９８５年至１９８７年的三年间就新增耕地２１００多万亩。目前，已有一些省、县从耕地净减少转变为净增加。
    对我国这样一个１１亿人口的大国来说，应把切实保护耕地，作为突破农业生产连年徘徊局面和促进国民经济长期稳定发展的重要战略措施，应受到上下各级的高度重视！
