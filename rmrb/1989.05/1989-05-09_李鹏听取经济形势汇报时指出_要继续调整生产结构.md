On the morning of May 9, Premier Li Peng presided over a meeting of the Premier's Office, during which he received a report on the current economic situation, as well as the arrangements for the living conditions and recovery of production in the areas affected by the Sichuan earthquake and severe wind and hailstorms.

In analyzing the economic development situation, Premier Li Peng emphasized: The production situation in the first four months indicates that, in the process of rectification and adjustment, as long as we take appropriate measures, economic stagnation and inflation can be avoided; for the existing irrationalities in the current production structure, we must continue to take effective measures to address them. The focus of production scheduling for May and June should be on continuing to adjust the production structure. The overall economic development speed should be slowed down, but for key state-owned enterprises and the production of scarce raw materials, support should be provided in terms of funds, energy, etc., to ensure an appropriate development speed.

The meeting heard a report from the head of the State Council's delegation to Sichuan, Minister of Civil Affairs Cui Naifu, on the arrangements for the living conditions and recovery of production in the disaster areas, and expressed condolences to the people in the disaster areas.

    李鹏总理在分析经济发展形势时着重指出：今年前４个月的生产情况表明，在治理、整顿中，只要我们采取的措施得当，经济滞胀是可以避免的；对当前生产结构上存在的不合理状况，要继续采取有效措施加以解决。５、６月份生产调度工作的重点，要继续调整生产结构，总的经济发展速度要放慢，但对国家重点企业和短缺原材料的生产，在资金、能源等方面要予以支持，保证有一个适当的发展速度。
