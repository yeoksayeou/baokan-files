The Soviet Union has recently designed a large astronomical telescope that can observe celestial bodies as faint as 28th magnitude. This telescope is expected to be completed by the end of the century.

The new telescope, designed by the Crimean Astrophysical Observatory, has a primary mirror with a diameter of 25 meters, composed of 300 hexagonal mirror segments. Each mirror segment is controlled by a computer to align with the observed target. This telescope, the largest in the world, will be installed in the highlands southeast of Samarkand, at an altitude of 2,500 to 2,700 meters.

The newly designed Soviet telescope can observe stars as faint as 28th magnitude, almost reaching the faintest celestial bodies in the universe.

　　苏联正研制世界最大天文望远镜
    据新华社莫斯科电  苏联最近设计出的大型天文望远镜可以观察到亮度为２８星等的天体，该天文望远镜将于本世纪末制成。
    由克里米亚天文物理实验室设计出的这台新型望远镜，镜面直径２５米，由３００块６角形镜面拼接成。每个镜面都由计算机控制，朝向所观察的目标。这台世界上最大的天文望远镜将安装在撒马尔罕东南海拔２５００至２７００米的高地上。
    苏联新设计的望远镜可以观察到２８等星，即几乎可以看到宇宙中亮度最弱的星体。
