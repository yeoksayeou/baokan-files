How to build an enterprise into a community of shared destiny? Recently, the experience of Dezhou Cotton Mill published in our newspaper provides another insight: it is necessary to coordinate material interests and do a good job in uniting people's hearts.

People's hearts are very important. Look, that female worker from Dezhou Cotton Mill, who had already walked seven or eight miles on her way home after work, returned to guide the truck that was delivering raw materials to the factory when she found it lost. There was no rule or regulation requiring her to do so; it was purely her heart that guided her actions.

Currently, to manage an enterprise well, we must focus on two aspects: improving the contract responsibility system and strengthening management. Strengthening enterprise management has different specific methods for different enterprises and different managers have different specific ideas. However, there is one rule that must be followed: a leading comrade who has been engaged in economic work for many years recently said that enterprise management can be divided into "hard management" and "soft management." "Hard management" mainly refers to rules and regulations, while "soft management" mainly refers to ideological work. He believes that without the support of "soft management," "hard management" will also find it difficult to proceed smoothly.

The practice of Dezhou Cotton Mill proves this point. For example, they strictly manage smoking, with heavy penalties. However, first, the leaders lead by example in enforcing the rules, and second, the masses understand that this is a matter of life and death for the enterprise, so everyone voluntarily complies. In Tianjin, there is a garment factory that uses closed-circuit television to "monitor" the workshop's work situation. Initially, some people compared this factory to "Wild Plum Mountain," but after the workers understood the reason, they all supported this method and supported the factory director. They said that this is not aimed at the majority of workers, but at a few disciplinarians.

Some managers often show their skills in their ability to understand the "hearts" of the workers. A factory, after democratic discussion, made the following regulation: for every worker who is late, the worker is fined 1 yuan, the group leader of the worker's group is fined 5 yuan, and the workshop director is fined 10 yuan. At first glance, this penalty seems unreasonable, but in practice, it is very effective. Upon closer examination, its brilliance lies in the fact that it not only uses economic means to control people but also uses stricter measures for leaders to influence people's hearts.

In Chengdu, Sichuan, there is a famous couplet at the Wuhou Temple: "To win hearts is to eliminate resistance; from ancient times, military strategists are not fond of war. To understand the situation is to avoid both leniency and severity; in the future, governing Sichuan requires three thoughts." Currently, in the process of reform and opening up and enterprise management, we encounter many contradictions, some of which are very sharp. The thought expressed in this couplet is very worth seriously considering for enterprise leaders.

### 人心很重要——三谈把企业建成命运共同体

　　人心很重要
    ——三谈把企业建成命运共同体
    文牛
    如何把企业建成命运共同体，不久前本报发表的德州市棉纺厂的经验给我们提供了另一启示：必须在协调好物质利益关系的基础上，做好聚拢人心的工作。
    人心很重要。你看，德棉那位女工，本来下班回家已走了七八里路，但她发现给本厂送原材料的卡车不知道路的时候，就自动地返回作向导。没有一条规章制度要求她这样做，完全是“心”在支配着她。
    搞好企业，目前要抓住两条：完善承包，加强管理。加强企业管理，不同企业有不同的具体做法，不同经营者有不同的具体思路。但有一条规律非遵循不可：最近一位搞了多年经济工作的领导同志说，企业管理可以分为“硬管理”和“软管理”两个方面。“硬管理”主要指的是规章制度，“软管理”主要指人的思想工作。他认为，没有“软管理”的支持，“硬管理”也很难顺利进行。
    德棉的实践证明了这个道理。比如，他们对吸烟这一条管理很严，处罚也很重。但是，第一、领导带头执行规章，第二、群众懂得这是关系企业安危的大事，大家都自觉地遵守。天津有个服装厂，实行用闭路电视“监视”车间工作情况的办法，开始有的人把此厂比作“野麦岭”，但工人明白其中道理之后，都很拥护这种办法，也都拥护这位厂长。他们说，这不是针对我们广大工人的，是治极少数违纪的人。
    一些经营者的本事往往表现在他善于体察职工的“人心”上。有个工厂经过民主讨论作了这样的规定：凡职工迟到者，本人罚１元，本人所在小组组长罚５元，车间主任罚１０元。这样的处罚初看起来没什么道理，但执行起来，效果很好。细想起来，它的高明之处，在于这不仅是用经济手段卡人，更是用对领导更加严格的办法作用于人心。
    四川成都武侯祠有一副著名的对联，写的是：“能攻心则反侧自消自古兵家非好战，不审势则宽严皆误后来治蜀要三思。”目前，在改革开放和企业管理当中，遇到众多矛盾，有的甚至是很尖锐的矛盾，这副对联所表现的思想，对于企业的领导者，是很值得认真参考的。
