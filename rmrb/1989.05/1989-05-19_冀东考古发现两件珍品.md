Recently, in the bone artifacts unearthed in Qian'an County, Hebei Province, two rare bone artifacts were discovered. This is another significant achievement in China's archaeological excavations.

These two bone artifacts include a bone needle and a bone awl. The bone needle is eight centimeters long, with a sharp, rounded tip and a round eye, crafted with exquisite precision, reflecting advanced manufacturing techniques. It is known that similar bone tools have been found in Zhoukoudian, Beijing, and Xianrendong, Liaoning, but this is the first time such artifacts have been discovered in the Eastern Hebei region. The other artifact is a bone awl. Experts have identified that currently, only three such bone awls have been found in China. The tip of the bone awl is wedge-shaped, and the handle has about thirty short, slanted lines carved into it. The bone awl's craftsmanship showcases the advanced scraping techniques and primitive creativity of the early Neolithic period, as well as the rough and monotonous artistic characteristics of the late Paleolithic period. The discovery of these two bone artifacts further enriches the content of China's primitive culture and provides valuable physical evidence for studying the formation of primitive culture in the late Paleolithic period in the Eastern Hebei region.

　　冀东考古发现两件珍品
    最近，在河北省迁安县出土的骨制品中，发现两件珍奇的骨制品，这是我国考古发掘工作取得的又一重要成果。
    这两件骨制品，一件为骨针，长八厘米，针尖圆锐，针孔呈圆形，制作极为精巧，反映出高超的制作技术。据悉，同类骨器曾在北京周口店和辽宁仙人洞有过发现，而在冀东地区还是首次。另一件是骨锥。经有关专家鉴定，目前，在我国只发现了三件。骨锥锥尖呈梯形，锥柄上有三十几道刻划的短斜线纹，骨锥的制作具有新石器时代早期高超的刮削技术和朴素的创造性以及旧石器时代晚期粗犷单调的艺术特征。这两件骨制品的发现，进一步丰富了我国原始文化内涵，为研究冀东地区旧石器时代晚期原始文化的形成，提供了宝贵的实物资料。
