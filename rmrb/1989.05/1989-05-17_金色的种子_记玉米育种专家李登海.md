Another unforgettable period—October 1988, a new maize variety was born! Li Denghai's newly bred "340×478" combination achieved a yield of 1,008.88 kilograms per mu, breaking the national summer maize record of 962.1 kilograms per mu set by himself in 1986. It surpassed "Yi Dan 2" in many excellent traits.

In 1974, as he was about to leave Laiyang Agricultural College, Li Denghai asked his teacher Liu Enxin where he should focus his efforts next. Professor Liu solemnly handed him 20 maize seeds (basic materials from the United States), saying, "Maize is our 'national treasure' with great potential for increased yield. You should choose this path!"

Li Denghai, a farmer from Houdeng Village, Xiyou Town, Laiyang, used these 20 breeding materials to conduct 4 years of hard work and trials, selecting the excellent "Yi 107" inbred line. He used it to create the "Yi Dan 2" maize variety. It has heavy ears, is resistant to leaf blight, and has strong adaptability, quickly gaining popularity in various regions.

The personnel department arranged for Li Denghai to work at the municipal Science and Technology Commission, but he continued to work in the experimental fields, conducting research on more than 20,000 hybrid combinations and over 20,000 hybridization trials. He cultivated 12 excellent inbred lines suitable for different regions, including late-maturing large-ear types, mid-late maturing large-ear types, and early-mid maturing large-ear types.

The "8112×81274" new combination reached 900 kilograms per mu in Lijiang, Naxi Autonomous County, Yunnan, an increase of over 200 kilograms per mu compared to local varieties.

In the winter of 1984, Li Denghai's research partners in the village either rode "electric donkeys" to engage in sales or changed into new clothes to work in factories, leaving only 13 empty rooms...

Li Denghai did not leave. He was searching for a new path. Once, he read an article in a science and technology magazine about the United States establishing integrated research, production, and marketing farms, and he was overjoyed. He immediately decided to establish a privately-run agricultural experimental station, taking the path of using research to support research. Soon, the sign for the privately-run "Houdeng Agricultural Experimental Station" was hung up.

The experimental station operates independently, with its own profits and losses. Thirty young people dedicated to scientific research joined forces, working hard together. They used their own parent lines to propagate high-quality seeds in Liaoning, Hebei, and other regions, achieving simultaneous breeding, trials, and promotion. This accelerated the transformation of research results into productive forces and enhanced their self-development capabilities. An 80-square-meter office building was completed, with breeding rooms, development rooms, and cultivation rooms; a 120-square-meter greenhouse was completed, allowing for two maize planting seasons per year; more than 60 trial and demonstration sites were established in different regions across the country; a new breeding base was opened in Hainan, improving research and living conditions. The station's fixed assets developed to 150,000 yuan. Under the influence of the experimental station, the number of seed management departments in the city increased to 6, supplying 25 million kilograms of high-quality seeds to other regions each year.

Li Denghai should be happy. But who knows his struggles?

As the sowing season approaches, the breeding fields have not been harvested or prepared. Where can he find manpower? Some people, seeing that Denghai's experimental station made money, developed jealousy; some relatives believed they should gain more benefits from Denghai, and if not satisfied, they distanced themselves.

He is busy all day. Production needs to be arranged personally, management requires constant attention, and breeding cannot do without him. Every autumn, he flies to Hainan Island like a migratory bird, but he has no time to help his wife with household chores. He made a tough decision and sent his children to his sister's home in Nanjing.

Seeds must break through the soil. Currently, the "Yi Dan 2" variety has been promoted in various regions, covering a total area of 65 million mu, increasing maize production by 8 billion kilograms.

Last year, when Li Denghai received the National Youth Science and Technology Award and was promoted to Senior Agronomist, he said with confidence, "We have the responsibility and ability to enter the world seed market. Otherwise, we would be unworthy of the golden land!"

　　金色的种子    
    ——记玉米育种专家李登海
    邓兆安
    又是一个难忘的岁月——１９８８年１０月，一个新的玉米良种问世了！李登海选育的“３４０×４７８”新组合以亩产１００８．８８公斤的成绩，刷新了１９８６年由他本人创造的９６２．１公斤的全国夏玉米最高纪录。它以众多优良性状超过了“掖单２号”。
    １９７４年，即将离开莱阳农学院的李登海请教他的老师刘恩训，今后该向哪里投足？刘教授庄重地把２０粒玉米（美国分离自交系基本材料）交给李登海，说：“玉米是咱们的‘国宝’，增产潜力很大，你就选择这条路吧！”
    李登海，这位莱州西由镇后邓村的农民，用这２０粒育种材料经过４年的辛勤试验，选育出性状优良的“掖１０７”自交系，用它配制成“掖单２号”玉米良种。它穗粒重，抗叶斑病，适应性强，很快就在各地得到推广。
    人事部门安排李登海到市科委工作，他继续在试验田里攻关，先后从２万多个杂交组合、两万多次杂交试验中，培育出适合各地条件的晚熟大穗型、中晚熟大穗型、早中熟大穗型等１２个紧凑型优良自交系。
    ８１１２×８１２７４新组合在云南丽江纳西族自治县达到了９００公斤，比当地品种亩增２００多公斤。
    １９８４年冬，李登海在村里的科研伙伴，有的跨上“电驴子”跑运销去了，有的换上新装进了工厂，只留下冷冷清清的１３间房……
    李登海没有走。他在寻觅一条新的路子。一次，他翻阅一本科技杂志，看到美国兴办科研、生产、经营一体化农场的消息，欣喜万分，当即下决心要创建民办农业试验站，走以科研养科研的路子。不久，民办的“后邓农业试验站”的大牌子挂起来了。
    试验站实行独立核算，自负盈亏，３０名有志于科研事业的年轻人抱成一团，奋力拚搏，他们利用自己培育的亲本，在辽宁、河北等地进行良种繁殖，做到了边育种、边试验、边推广，既加快了科研成果向生产力的转化，又增强了自我发展的能力。８０多平方米的办公室建成了，有育种室、开发室、栽培室；１２０平方米的温室大棚竣工了，一年可种植两季玉米；在全国不同地区设立了６０多个试验、示范点；开辟了海南育种新基地，改善了科研和生活条件，全站固定资产发展到了１５万元；在试验站的带动影响下，全市经营种子的部门发展到６家，每年向外地供应良种２５００万公斤。
    李登海真该高兴了。可谁又知道他的苦？
    快到播种期了，育种地还没收没整。哪来的人手？有些人看到登海的试验站挣了钱，嫉妒平地而生；一些亲友认为理应从登海身上得到更多的实惠，不满足就躲得远远的。
    整天忙得团团转。生产要亲自安排，经营要不时过问，育种更离不开他，每年秋后他还要像候鸟一样飞往海南岛，唯独没有时间帮妻子减轻一点家庭负担。他狠了狠心，把孩子送到了南京的姐姐家中。
    是种子总要破土而出。目前，“掖单二号”良种在各地累计推广面积达６５００万亩，增产玉米８０亿公斤。
    去年，当李登海又获得全国青年科技奖，并被晋升为高级农艺师时，他满怀信心地说：“我们有责任、有能力去跻身世界种子市场。否则，对不起金色的大地！”
