A rare wheat aphid, the gray aphid, has brought devastating damage to the wheat crops in Danning County, Shanxi Province, which are currently in the heading stage. Out of the county's seven hundred thousand mu of wheat, six hundred thousand mu have been affected to varying degrees. In some fields, there are more than four hundred gray aphids per square foot. Although the county government has taken timely measures to control and prevent the infestation, a reduction in yield for tens of thousands of mu of crops is inevitable.

The gray aphid, a type of wheat aphid, is a rare pest that has not been seen in Shanxi Province for many years. This year, due to the warm winter and abundant rainfall, the gray aphid has reproduced rapidly, causing significant damage to the wheat crops. The county government has organized personnel to conduct investigations and has taken measures such as spraying pesticides and using biological control methods to control the infestation. However, due to the large scale of the infestation and the rapid reproduction of the gray aphid, the damage to the wheat crops is severe, and a reduction in yield is inevitable.

The county government has called on all relevant departments and units to strengthen their efforts in controlling the gray aphid infestation and to do everything possible to minimize the damage to the wheat crops. The government has also urged farmers to actively participate in the control efforts and to report any suspected infestations to the relevant authorities immediately. The county government has pledged to provide all necessary support to the farmers in their efforts to control the infestation and to ensure a bumper harvest this year.
