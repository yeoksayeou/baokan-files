    Mechanism for Talent Mobility Urgently Needs to Be Established
    Basic Framework to Be Established Within Five Years

    According to a report by Xinhua News Agency reporter Li Chunlin, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Personnel, recently said in Yantai, Shandong, that to meet the needs of reform and development, and to solve the problem of talent mobility on a comprehensive basis, it is necessary to establish a talent mobility mechanism that adapts to the development of a commodity economy. The goal is to set up the basic framework for this mechanism within five years.

    The Ministry of Personnel recently held the first national talent mobility work conference in Yantai. It was reported that in recent years, various places have generally established talent mobility service institutions, created some talent markets, and formulated some regulations that are conducive to talent mobility. In just 1986 and 1987, the number of professional and technical personnel supported by various places for township enterprises was more than 210,000, and more than 10,000 scientific research achievements were transferred. However, the difficulty in talent mobility remains the main trend at present. A study shows that currently, 30% of the country's professional and technical personnel have the intention to move, but the talent mobility rate is only 2.6%. Nationwide, professional and technical personnel move an average of 0.87 times in their lifetime, which is far behind other countries, especially developed countries.

    Zhang Hanfu proposed that the target model for China's talent mobility mechanism is a planned talent market, that is, to establish a talent mobility mechanism with the talent market as the main regulator, and to effectively play the role of national macro-control.

    He believes that the basic points for establishing this mechanism are: to reform the appointment system for various types of personnel and implement "mutual selection"; to establish a social security system to provide multi-faceted social security for the selection and elimination of the best and worst by government agencies, enterprises and institutions, and social organizations and for individuals' employment; to establish and improve the talent mobility service system to smooth the supply and demand channels for talent; under the guidance of national planning, to use administrative, economic, and legal means to strengthen the state's control over the talent market, guide the direction and speed of talent flow, and maintain the regional balance of talent.

　　人才流动机制亟需建立
    五年内将搭起基本框架
    本报讯  新华社记者李春林报道：人事部副部长张汉夫日前在山东烟台说，为了适应改革和发展的需要，从总体上解决人才流动难的问题，必须建立起适应商品经济发展的人才流动机制，力争５年内搭起这个机制的基本框架。
    人事部前不久在烟台召开全国首次人才流动工作会议。据介绍，近年来各地普遍建立了人才流动服务机构，出现了一些人才市场，制定了一些有利于人才流动的法规。仅１９８６年和１９８７年两年，各地支援乡镇企业的专业技术人员就有２１万多人，转让科研成果１万多项。但是，人才流动难仍然是当前的主要倾向。一项研究表明，目前全国专业技术人员中，有３０％的人有流动意向，但人才流动率只有２．６％。全国专业技术人员一生中，人均流动仅０．８７次，与其他国家尤其发达国家相差甚远。
    张汉夫提出，我国人才流动机制的目标模式是有计划的人才市场，即建立以人才市场为调节主体，并能有效发挥国家宏观调控职能的人才流动机制。
    他认为，建立这种机制的基本要点是：改革各类人员的任用制度，实行“双向选择”；建立社会保障制度，为机关、企事业、社会团体择优汰劣与个人择业提供多方面的社会保障；建立健全人才流动服务体系，疏通人才供求渠道；在国家计划指导下，利用行政、经济和法律手段，加强国家对人才市场的调控，引导人才的流向和流速，维持人才区域性平衡。
