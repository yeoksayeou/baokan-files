Pirate ships, which had disappeared for many years, have recently resurfaced in the southeastern coastal waters of Zhejiang Province. Since mid-March, a group of "pirates" from Fujian Province have been prowling the waters from Yuhuan's Pishan to Yangjia in Taizhou, taking advantage of their large ships, numerous crew members, and high speeds. They use methods such as wearing masks, threatening with clubs, and coordinating multiple ships to intercept, stealing or forcibly purchasing large quantities of fish from dozens of fishing boats, and injuring several people.

To severely crack down on "pirate" activities, the Taizhou Border Defense Detachment of Zhejiang Province, in accordance with the deployment of local public security organs, identified the targets, and promptly coordinated with the fisheries administration, maritime patrol detachment, and Wenling Border Defense Squad, deploying four ships to carry out a joint anti-piracy operation. To date, they have intercepted eight ships without registration numbers and four other illegal ships; seized 42 packages of explosives and two masks; confiscated 2,500 kilograms of illegally obtained fish, 80 tons of rice, over 7,000 eel fry, and 216,000 yuan in cash. The intercepted ships were also legally investigated, and appropriate actions were taken based on the severity of the offenses.

　　找准整治目标　保卫人民利益
    台州边防支队严厉打击海盗
    本报讯  绝迹多年的海盗船抢劫风近来又在浙江东南沿海卷起。３月中旬以来，一批来自福建的“海盗”船游弋于浙江玉环披山至椒江洋歧一带海域，依仗船大、人多、航速快，采用蒙面作案、用棍棒威胁、多船结伙围截等手段，抢走或强购走数十艘渔船上的大批渔货，并打伤多人。
    为严厉打击“海盗”活动，浙江省台州地区边防支队根据当地公安机关的部署，找准目标，及时会同渔政、海巡支队、温岭边防大队等部门，出动４艘船艇，开展联合扫海盗行动。到目前，共查获无船号的船８艘，其他违法船只４艘；缴获炸药４２包，假面具２副；查扣非法所得的渔货２５００公斤，大米８０吨，鳗苗７０００余尾及现金２１．６万元，并依法对被查扣的船只进行了审查，依据情节轻重，分别作出了处理。
