    The modern population is the foundation for the development of China's contemporary population. Today, the population issue is not only a globally significant problem but also a serious practical issue facing China's modernization. Exploring the historical aspects of China's modern population problems can help in comprehensively and deeply understanding semi-colonial and semi-feudal modern Chinese society. It is also of significant importance for solving contemporary population issues and formulating new population policies.

    High birth rates, high death rates, and low natural growth rates are the characteristics of China's modern population.
    The Qing Dynasty was an important historical period for the development of China's population. According to historical records, from the Han Dynasty, when the first official national population census was conducted, until the Ming Dynasty, China's total population fluctuated between 40 million and 60 million. The nearly twenty years of social turmoil from the late Ming to the early Qing Dynasty led to the collapse of the social economy, and the total population decreased from the Ming Dynasty's base. During the reigns of Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong, the feudal rulers implemented economic policies such as "prosperous times increase population, never increase taxes" and "distribute land taxes," and further rectified the household registration system, greatly encouraging the concealment of population, leading to an unprecedented surge in population growth. In the sixth year of Qianlong (1741), China's population exceeded one billion for the first time in history, followed by two billion, three billion, and by the time of the Opium War in 1840, the total population reached 412.8 million (Liang Fangzhong: "Statistics of Households, Land, and Land Taxes in Chinese Dynasties").
    After entering the modern era, the development of the national population can be roughly divided into three periods: from the Opium War to the outbreak of the Taiping Rebellion was a period of slow growth. During this time, the economic policies of the mid-Qing Dynasty that stimulated population growth continued to have an effect, and the imperialist forces had not yet penetrated deeply into the interior, so the population continued to grow at the rate of the Jiaqing, Daoguang, and Xianfeng periods. In the first year of Xianfeng, the total population reached 431.8 million, marking the peak of modern population growth. The more than ten years of the Taiping Rebellion belonged to the period of decline. During this time, the Taiping Rebellion in the south, the Nian Rebellion in the north, and various uprisings by ethnic minorities in the northwest and other regions lasted for more than ten years, affecting more than ten provinces. The brutal suppression and slaughter by the Qing reactionary forces and foreign invaders led to a sharp decrease in the total population, with "reports missing several provinces, and the verifiable ones only having 20 to 30 million people" (History of the Qing Dynasty, Volume 121, Food and Economy 2). The more than thirty years at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the more than ten years of the Beiyang warlord rule were a period of fluctuation in population development. During this time, after the hard work of the broad masses of the people, the war-torn social economy gradually began to recover, and the total population slowly increased, reaching 420 million at the beginning of the 20th century. However, the more than two thousand years of feudal autocratic rule in China had reached its final stage of collapse, and the deepening of imperialist aggression, frequent natural disasters, and the constant peasant uprisings were all serious social factors threatening the Qing Dynasty's rule. They also exacerbated the fluctuations in population reproduction, and by the late Qing and early Republic periods, the total population did not reach the level of the early Xianfeng period.
    The development of China's modern population has thus experienced such a large cycle of decline and recovery. In terms of the rate of development, it was not only significantly slower than the mid-Qing Dynasty but also lagged far behind the world's population development level during the same period. This is what is generally referred to as the high birth rate, high death rate, and low natural growth rate type of population reproduction.
    From the perspective of natural population changes, the natural growth rate of the population is determined by the birth rate and death rate. In modern China, where the natural economy was dominant, increasing the population to obtain a large labor force was a necessary condition for the existence and development of this society and an internal economic requirement. Coupled with the constraints of traditional early marriage and childbearing, as well as the "many children, many blessings" ideology, the birth rate in modern China remained at a relatively high level. However, the high death rate always accompanied this high birth rate, resulting in a very slow population growth rate. Indeed, the semi-colonial and semi-feudal mode of production was the root cause of the large fluctuations and slow growth of modern China's population development. However, wars, famines, and opium were the main and direct factors. The impact of wars and famines on the population changes in modern China is obvious. After Zeng Guofan occupied Nanjing, he killed more than 100,000 people in three days. In the Hailar Incident, the Russian army slaughtered more than 200,000 Chinese people. After the Taiping Rebellion, many regions experienced "no trace of people" and "only five out of ten survived." After various natural disasters in the late Qing Dynasty, the number of deaths reached 37 million (Deng Yuntian: "History of Chinese Relief"). These are clear examples of the high death rate. The impact of opium on the population changes in modern China was invisible but continuous. Before and after the Opium War, some officials and soldiers had already started to consume opium in large quantities. After the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, the Qing government adopted the policy of "prohibiting through taxation," openly acknowledging the legality of opium imports, and later implementing "prohibiting through cultivation and opening cultivation," leading to an increasing trend of opium consumption and poppy cultivation. "In cities and towns, all are opium dens, and in remote villages, most are opium smokers. Roughly estimated, 70-80% smoke opium, and 20-30% do not" (Liu Dapeng: "Yixiangzhai Diary," Opium). Such a large number of Chinese people consuming opium not only "wasted vitality and dissipated willpower" but also severely damaged their health, shortened their lifespan, and affected their reproductive capacity.

    The root cause of the surplus population in semi-colonial and semi-feudal modern China lies in the mode of production.
    Although the development of the population in semi-colonial and semi-feudal modern China was very slow, the surplus population continued to increase.
    The so-called "surplus population" does not simply refer to the quantity of the population but rather a "surplus" relative to certain production conditions, that is, a relative surplus population.
    Undoubtedly, the root cause of the surplus population in modern China lies in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal mode of production. The invasion of capitalist forces, on the one hand, destroyed China's original traditional agricultural and handicraft industry layout that could accommodate more labor, accelerating the disintegration of the self-sufficient natural economy, thus creating an increasingly large surplus population. On the other hand, under the brutal oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudalism, Chinese capitalism developed like a snail, slowly and unable to absorb millions of surplus population, thus determining that the surplus population in modern China not only existed in large numbers but also continued to emerge.
    Compared to the surplus population in capitalist society, the surplus population in modern China had two distinct characteristics. First, the surplus population problem in Western capitalist society became prominent only after the establishment of the capitalist system, while the surplus population in modern China reappeared on the basis of a sharp increase in population in the late feudal society. The more than 400 million people before the Opium War were the historical premise for its development. Second, in capitalist society, the rapid development of productive forces and the use of machinery expanded the ranks of wage laborers; on the other hand, with the accumulation of capital and the continuous improvement of the organic composition of capital, the demand for labor power relatively decreased. Marx summarized this phenomenon as "productive forces oppressing the population." Modern China was the opposite: the long-term stagnation of productive forces led to the expansion of the surplus population, and the surplus population became a serious obstacle to the development of productive forces, which can also be said to be "population oppressing productive forces."
    So, how did the surplus population in modern China exist? We believe that Marx's analysis of the three forms of existence of relative surplus population in capitalist society is also applicable to modern China. First, the floating surplus population. This part of the population exists in cities and is composed of unemployed people in the industry. Due to the extremely limited development of modern Chinese industry, industrial workers accounted for a very small proportion of the total population, so this floating surplus population was indeed a minority. Second, the latent surplus population. This part of the population exists among the 85% of the national population engaged in agriculture, mainly formed due to the decline of agriculture and major natural disasters, and is the main form of surplus population in modern China. Third, the stagnant surplus population, existing among agricultural and handicraft populations, produced by the continuous destruction of the natural economic structure.
    The surplus population problem had brought serious social consequences to modern China. As early as the eve of the Taiping Rebellion, Marx clearly pointed out: "In this country, the slowly but steadily increasing surplus population has long made the social conditions of this nation a heavy shackle for the majority of its people" (Marx and Engels: "Collected Works," Volume 7, Page 264). In modern China, except for the Northeast, the expansion of cultivated land had basically stopped, the development of productive forces was in a long-term stagnant state, and the feudal mode of production had become a heavy shackle on the development of productive forces. It combined with foreign capitalist forces, making it impossible for Chinese national capitalism to develop, thus making the surplus population problem an insurmountable burden. Economic backwardness, soaring food prices, frequent disasters, ecological imbalances, and widespread "rebellions" were all inseparable from the serious surplus population problem.

    The distribution and migration of China's modern population have undergone a complex process.
    From the perspective of mechanical population changes, the distribution and migration of China's modern population have also undergone a complex transformation process.
    In the history of the Chinese nation, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River were the birthplace of ancient civilization and the center of national population distribution. After the Han Dynasty, with the development and changes of society and the economy, the population center gradually shifted to the southeast. Entering the modern era, the most significant feature of population distribution was that after the total national population reached its historical peak, the inland population continuously migrated to the Northeast, the border areas, and the Northwest. Coastal residents, either due to livelihood or being kidnapped by invaders, also migrated overseas in large numbers, gradually narrowing the long-standing disparity in population distribution between the east and west.
    In the early Xianfeng period, the total national population reached its historical peak of 430 million. At the same time, the population center was not only significantly biased towards the southeast but also showed a decreasing trend from the coast to the interior. After that, during the Taiping Rebellion, the population in the southeastern provinces decreased significantly, with provinces like Jiangsu and Zhejiang even decreasing by more than one-third. The people in coastal provinces like Guangdong and Fujian, under the pressure of livelihood, migrated overseas on a larger scale. Imperialist invaders also kidnapped a large number of "coolies" abroad. These factors all slowed down the population growth in the eastern region and relatively reduced the population density. On the other hand, due to the severe contradiction of "limited land and too many people" and "insufficient land for cultivation" in the vast inland areas, the Qing government, in order to maintain the interests of feudal rule, successively lifted the bans on the Northeast, border areas, and Northwest, encouraging people to "move to the borders and settle." This led to an increase in the total population in the western regions and a gradual increase in population density, narrowing the gap in population distribution between the east and west to some extent. However, throughout the history of modern China, the imbalance in population distribution, that is, the significant disparity in population distribution between the east and west, remained prominent.
    From the perspective of urban and rural population distribution, the rural population in modern China has always accounted for more than 85% of the total population, but the migration of the rural population to cities, that is, the urbanization process, was also slowly proceeding. In the long history of feudal society, China's population urbanization, whether in terms of the scale of cities or the number of towns, was at the forefront of the world, but in the modern era, it fell far behind. Starting from the second half of the 18th century, major Western capitalist countries successively experienced bourgeois revolutions and industrial revolutions. The development of capitalist economy, the use of large machinery in agricultural production, and the capitalist transformation of agriculture pushed many agricultural and handicraft workers off the land. At the same time, the development of urban economy provided opportunities for this part of the population to move, thus "population also concentrates like capital" (Marx and Engels: "Collected Works," Volume 2, Page 300). The speed of population urbanization was greatly accelerated. Modern China's agriculture did not undergo capitalist transformation, and the decline of agricultural production forced millions of peasants to leave the land and flow into cities. However, the development of cities was also very limited. Although cities like Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Tianjin emerged along the rivers and coasts, this batch of cities not only had limited scale and production but also had obvious colonial characteristics. The original batch of feudal cities, such as Xi'an, Kaifeng, Beijing, and Hangzhou, either due to economic decline or war attacks, were all in a long-term stagnant state. This made the speed of population urbanization in modern China far behind the development level of the world at that time.

    The population problem has always been a serious social issue in semi-colonial and semi-feudal Chinese society. Various representatives of different social classes have proposed various solutions. During the Taiping Rebellion, Wang Shizhou exclaimed, "The cause of the chaos is the excessive population; excessive population leads to poverty, and long-term governance leads to chaos" (Wang Shizhou: "Diary of Yi Bing," Volume 3). He proposed specific measures such as infanticide and birth control. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Xue Fuchen also regarded the "problem of overpopulation" as a burden causing the late Qing Dynasty's poverty and weakness, advocating "dredging the sources of wealth." Sun Yat-sen, Liao Zhongkai, and other revolutionary party members, on the one hand, criticized Malthus's population theory, and on the other hand, proposed measures such as "moving to the borders and settling," developing production, and improving population quality. Some scholars in the 1920s and 1930s also proposed various specific measures and plans, but none of these could truly solve the problem.
    After the founding of the nation, the establishment of the socialist system and Marxist population theory provided a realistic possibility for us to solve this historical legacy. Unfortunately, due to the interference of leftist errors, we mistakenly criticized the correct proposals of scholars like Ma Yincui's "New Population Theory," leading to a temporary mistake in this regard. Today, "a large population and a weak foundation" remain the basic national conditions. Learning from the experiences and lessons of China's modern population problems and formulating population policies suitable for the new era are realistic issues that we must seriously address in the process of modernization.

　　中国近代的人口问题
    行龙
    近代人口是现代中国人口发展的基础。
    今天，人口问题不仅是一个引人注目的全球性问题，而且成为中国现代化建设过程中面临的严重现实问题。对中国近代人口问题进行历史的探讨，不仅有助于全面而深刻地认识半殖民地半封建的近代中国社会，而且对于解决新时期的人口问题及制定新的人口政策，都是具有一定意义的。
  高出生率、高死亡率、低自然增长率是近代中国人口的特点
    清代是中国人口发展的重要历史时期。据文献记载，自汉代有正式的全国人口记录以来，直至明代，我国人口总数一直在四千万到六千万之间停滞徘徊。明末清初近二十年的社会动乱，致使社会经济破败凋残，人口总数在明代的基础上又有所下降。康熙、雍正、乾隆三朝，封建统治者实行“盛世滋生人丁，永不加赋”和“摊丁入亩”的经济政策，并进一步整顿户籍制度，大大刺激了隐匿户口的出现，人口的发展出现了前所未有的猛增趋势。乾隆六年（１７４１年），我国人口一举突破有史以来的一亿大关，接着突破两亿，三亿，到鸦片战争爆发的１８４０年，全国人口总数达到四亿一千二百八十余万（梁方仲：《中国历代户口、田地、田赋统计》）。
    进入近代以后，全国人口的发展大致经过了三个时期：从鸦片战争到太平天国革命爆发的十年是缓增时期。此间由于清代中叶实行的一系列刺激人口增长的经济政策仍在继续起着作用，帝国主义的侵略势力也尚未深入内地，人口的发展依然保持着乾嘉道以来继续增长的势头。咸丰元年，全国人口总数达到四亿三千一百八十余万，是近代人口增长的最高点。太平天国活动的十余年属降减时期。这一期间，南方的太平天国战争，北方的捻军起义，西北及其它地区的少数民族起义，前后连绵十余年，波及范围十余省，其间清朝反动武装及外国侵略者的残酷镇压与杀戮，致使全国人口总数锐减，“册报每缺数省，其可稽者，只二万数千万口不等”（《清史稿》卷一百二十一，食货二）。清末的三十余年及北洋军阀统治的十余年是人口发展的起伏时期。这一期间，经过广大人民长期的艰苦劳动，战后破败的社会经济又逐渐开始复苏，人口总数也在缓慢地回升，二十世纪初曾恢复到四亿二千余万。但是，中国两千多年的封建专制统治毕竟到了它最后崩溃瓦解的阶段，帝国主义侵略的步步深入，频仍不断的自然灾害，此起彼伏的农民暴动，这些都成为严重威胁清朝统治的社会因素，同时也加剧着人口再生产的起伏性，直到清末民初，全国人口总数也未达到咸丰初年的水平。
    中国近代的人口发展就是经过了如上这样一个降而复升的大周期，就其发展速度来看，它不仅比清代中叶大为减慢，而且大大落后于同时期世界人口的发展水平，这也就是一般所说的具有高出生率、高死亡率、低自然增长率的高——高——低类型的人口再生产。
    从人口的自然变动来看，人口的自然增长率取决于人口的出生率与死亡率。在自然经济为主体的近代中国社会，通过增殖人口以获得大量劳动力，仍是这个社会存在和发展的必要条件，也是它内在的经济要求；加之传统的早婚早育、“多子多福”观念的束缚，致使近代中国人口的出生率保持在一个较高的水平上。但是，人口的高死亡率也始终伴随着这种高出生率，其结果是人口的增长速度十分缓慢。诚然，半殖民地半封建的社会生产方式是近代中国人口发展出现大起大落和缓慢的根源，但战乱、灾荒和鸦片则是主要和直接的因素。战乱与灾荒对近代中国人口消长的影响是显而易见的。曾国藩占领南京后，三天之内杀死十余万人。海兰泡事件中，俄军杀戮中国人民二十余万。太平天国战争后，许多地区出现“杳无人迹”、“十不存五”的现象。晚清各种自然灾害后，死亡人口达三千七百多万（邓云特：《中国救荒史》）。这都是人口出现高死亡率的明显例证。鸦片对近代中国人口消长的影响则是无形而持续的。鸦片战争前后，一部分官吏兵士就已开始大量吸食鸦片。咸、同之后，清政府采取“寓禁于征”的政策，公开承认鸦片输入合法化，后又实行“寓禁于种，驰禁开种”，致使吸食鸦片，种植罂粟之风日甚一日，“城镇村庄，尽为卖烟馆，穷乡僻壤，多是吸烟人。约略计之，吸之者十之七八，不吸者十之二三。”（刘大鹏：《遐想斋日记》鸦片烟说）如此众多的中国人吸食鸦片，不仅“耗精血、涣志气”，而且严重摧残体质，缩短人口寿命，影响到人口的繁衍能力。
  近代过剩人口产生的根源在于半殖民地半封建社会的生产方式
    半殖民地半封建中国近代人口的发展，虽然速度十分缓慢，但过剩人口却有增无已。
    所谓“过剩人口”，并不单指人口数量的多寡，而只是一种相对于一定生产条件而言的“过剩”人口，即一种相对的过剩人口。
    无疑，中国近代过剩人口产生的根源在于半殖民地半封建的社会生产方式。资本主义势力的侵入，一方面破坏了中国原来可以容纳较多劳动力的传统农业和手工业布局，加速了自给自足自然经济的瓦解，从而造成了日益庞大的过剩人口队伍。另一方面，受帝国主义和封建主义的残酷压迫与剥削，中国资本主义一直像蜗牛爬行，发展缓慢，根本无法吸收数以万计的过剩人口，这就决定了中国近代过剩人口不仅以其庞大的数量存在，而且会源源不断地涌现出来。
    同资本主义社会的过剩人口相比，中国近代过剩人口又有其两个明显的特点。其一，西方资本主义社会的过剩人口问题是在资本主义制度确立之后才日益突出起来的，而中国近代的过剩人口则是在封建社会末期人口猛增的基础上再现的，鸦片战争前四亿多人口是它发展的历史前提。其二，在资本主义社会，生产力的高速发展及机器的使用，使雇佣劳动者队伍日益扩大；另一方面，随着资本积累和资本有机构成的不断提高，资本对劳动力的需求却在相对减少，马克思把这种现象概括为“生产力压迫人口”。中国近代则恰恰相反，生产力的长期停滞状态使过剩人口队伍日益扩大，而过剩人口又成为生产力发展的严重障碍，这也可以说是“人口压迫生产力”。
    那么，中国近代的过剩人口是以怎样的形式存在着呢？我们认为，马克思分析资本主义相对过剩人口存在的三种形式同样适合于近代中国。第一，流动的过剩人口。这部分人口存在于城市，由产业中的失业人口构成。由于近代中国工业的发展极其有限，产业工人在总人口中所占比例极小，因而这种流动的过剩人口也毕竟属于少数。第二，潜在的过剩人口。这部分人口存在于占全国总人口８５％的农业人口中，多因农业的衰落和重大自然灾害所形成，是近代中国过剩人口的主要形式。第三，停滞的过剩人口，存在于农业和手工业人口中，由自然经济结构的不断破坏而产生。
    过剩人口问题曾给中国近代带来过严重的社会后果。早在太平天国革命爆发前夕，马克思就明确地指出：“在这个国家，缓慢地但不断地增加的过剩人口，早已使它的社会条件成为这个民族的大多数人的沉重枷锁”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第７卷第２６４页）。在中国近代，除东北之外，耕地面积的扩大已基本停止，生产力的发展处于长期的停滞状态，而封建的生产关系已经成为生产力发展的沉重桎梏，它与外国资本主义势力结合起来，使得中国民族资本主义发展不起来，这就使得过剩人口问题成为始终不能摆脱的包袱。经济发展的落后，粮食价格的高涨，频仍不断的灾害，生态环境的失调以及遍布各地的“民变”，都是与严重的过剩人口问题分不开的。
  中国近代人口分布和迁移经历了一个复杂过程
    从人口的机械变动来看，中国近代的人口分布和迁移也经历了一个复杂的变迁过程。
    在中华民族的历史上，黄河中、下游地区是古代文明的发源地，也是全国人口分布的重心所在。汉代以后，随着社会经济的发展变迁，人口重心逐渐向东南地区转移。进入近代以后，人口分布的最大特点是，在全国人口总数达到了历史上的最高水平之后，内地人口不断向东北、塞外及西北地区流迁，沿海人民或迫于生计，或被侵略者拐卖，也大量出洋定居，这就使得历史上长期形成的东西两部人口分布的悬殊差距逐渐缩小。
    咸丰初年，全国人口总数达到了四亿三千余万的历史最高水平，与此同时，人口分布的重心不仅明显偏于东南，而且呈现出了由沿海向内地递减的趋向。之后，太平天国战争期间，东南各省人口大量耗减，江苏、浙江等省甚至减少１／３多，广东、福建等沿海省份的人民，迫于生计以更大的规模向海外迁移，帝国主义侵略者又拐卖了大量的“猪仔”出国，这些都使得东部地区人口总数增长减慢，人口密度也相对下降。另一方面，由于广大内地“土狭人满”、“田不足耕”的严重矛盾，清政府从维护封建统治的利益出发，相继对东北、塞外、西北等地实行“开禁”，鼓励人民“移民实边”，这就使得西部地区的人口总数不断增加，人口密度也在逐渐提高，东西两部人口分布的差距有一定的缩小。但是，在整个中国近代历史上，人口分布的不平衡，即东西两部人口分布的悬殊差距一直十分突出。
    从人口的城乡分布来看，中国近代农村人口一直占人口的８５％以上，但农村人口向城市的流动，即人口的城市化过程也在缓慢地进行着。在长期的封建社会历史中，中国的人口城市化，无论是城市的规模，还是城镇的数目都是居于世界前列的，近代则远远地落伍了。１８世纪下半叶开始，西欧主要资本主义国家先后经过了资产阶级革命和工业革命，资本主义经济的发展，农业生产中大机器的使用及农业的资本主义化，使众多的农业和手工业者被排挤出土地，同时，城市经济的发展又为这部分人提供了流动的机会，这样，“人口也像资本一样地集中起来”（《马克思恩格斯全集》第２卷第３００页）。人口城市化的速度大大加快。中国近代的农业并没有资本主义化，农业生产的衰退迫使成百万的农民离开土地而流向城市，但城市的发展也极其有限，虽然在沿江、沿海也兴起了上海、广州、汉口、天津等较大城市，但这批城市不仅规模有限，生产不足，而且具有明显的殖民地色彩。而原有的一批封建城市，像西安、开封、北京、杭州等，或由于经济的衰退，或由于战争的袭击，均处于长期的停滞状态。这就使得中国近代的人口城市化速度大大落后于当时世界的发展水平。
    　　　　　　
    人口问题一直是半殖民地半封建中国社会的严重社会问题，对此，社会各阶级的代表人物都提出过这样或那样的解决方案。正逢太平天国革命时期的汪士铎惊呼，“世乱之由，人多；人多则穷，……久治思乱”（汪士铎：《乙丙日记》卷三）。进而提出溺婴、节制生育等具体办法；清末的薛福成也把“人满之患”看作是造成晚清积贫积弱局面的包袱，提出了“浚其生财之源”的主张；孙中山、廖仲恺等革命党人一方面批判马尔萨斯的人口论，一方面又提出了“移民实边”、发展生产、提高人口素质等主张；二、三十年代的部分学者也提出了这样或那样的具体办法与方案，但是，这些都没有也不可能使这一问题得到真正的解决。
    建国之后，社会主义制度的建立，马克思主义的人口理论，为我们解决这一历史的遗留问题提供了现实的可能性。遗憾的是由于左倾错误的干扰，我们错误地批判了像马寅初先生《新人口论》的正确方案，使我们在这一问题上出现了一度的失误。今天，“人口多、底子薄”仍然是我国的基本国情，汲取近代中国人口问题的经验教训，制定符合新时期的人口政策，是我们现代化建设过程中必须认真解决的现实问题。
