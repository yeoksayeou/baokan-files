Galina Ulanova led a group of Soviet artists to participate in the international arts festival held in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. She stayed at the Shenzhen Bay Hotel, where the window overlooks the sea, the blue sky, and the amusement park. From the day she checked in, the beautiful hotel was filled with a Russian spring wildness.

The name Ulanova represents a type of art, a fearless spirit of progress, and reminds us of the very beautiful period in the cultural exchange between China and the Soviet Union. Time flies, and the goddess of youth who once danced gracefully on the ballet stage, as light as the wind and as soft as the clouds, is now an elderly woman in her late seventies. She wears a pink silk blouse and a gold necklace. Her skin is fair, and the eighty years of hardship have not left many wrinkles on her face. She is dignified, calm, and composed, moving gracefully through the crowd and the countless applause and flowers. She awakens many of our beautiful memories.

When she appeared at the Shenzhen Grand Theater and the reception held by the Shenzhen Municipal Government, people gathered around her, shaking hands warmly and greeting her affectionately. Indeed, Ulanova has returned to our midst.

On the morning of May 8, reporters finally had the opportunity to talk with her face to face, listening to her heartfelt wishes and hopes. Following her clear voice, we reviewed her decades of glorious artistic career.

Young readers in China may not know that Ulanova originally wanted to be a sailor, but at the age of eighteen, fate pushed her onto the stage of a ballet star. She twice received the Hero of Socialist Labor medal. Her art transcended national borders and influenced the entire world. She has visited China four times. In the Soviet Union, she was the first person to have a statue erected in her honor while still alive.

During the conversation, someone asked, "What do you dislike the most?" She replied, "I dislike hypocrisy and flattery the most." I said, "In 1951, you visited China, and the great Chinese poet Ai Qing wrote a poem praising you, which is very famous. You won't consider it flattery, will you?" She laughed happily, "No! I have kept that poem. The poet is sincere."

The conversation then turned to the realm of art. She recalled that Ai Qing wrote about her ballet performance based on the imagery of Schumann's music, "A person flying in space": looking up at the front, stretching out her right hand, with her dance dress fluttering like clouds. The photographer captured this moment, which spread around the world and was considered a symbol of peace and tranquility.

Yes, the name Ulanova also represents peace.

　　乌兰诺娃今日风姿
    本报记者  卢祖品
    乌兰诺娃率领苏联艺术家小组参加了这次在深圳、珠海举行的国际艺术节。她下榻的深圳湾大酒店，窗外是大海，蓝天，娱乐园。从她进住的那一天起，这座美丽的酒店就充满了一种俄罗斯原野春天的气息。
    乌兰诺娃的名字代表了一种艺术门类，代表了一种无畏的进取精神，令人想起中苏两国文化交流中那段非常美好的岁月。时光荏苒，当年蹁跹在芭蕾舞台上，像风一样轻，像云一样柔软的青春女神，如今已是年近八十的老太太了。她穿一件粉红丝绸上衣，脖上挂一串金项练。皮肤白皙。八十年的风霜，没有在她脸上刻下很多皱纹。仪态端庄，气定神闲，从容地行进在人流的漩涡和无数掌声、鲜花之中。她唤醒我们许多美好的记忆。
    当她出现在深圳大剧院大厅和深圳市政府举行的招待会上时，人们围过去簇拥着她，热烈的握手，亲切的问候。的确，乌兰诺娃又回到了我们中间。
    五月八日上午，记者们终于有了机会同她面对面交谈，倾听她发自内心深处的祝愿和希望。我们循着那清脆声音，回顾了她几十年辉煌的艺术生涯。
    中国年轻的读者也许不大知道，乌兰诺娃原先想当一名水手，但在她十八岁时命运把她推上了芭蕾明星的宝座，两次获得苏维埃社会主义劳动英雄勋章。她的艺术越出了国境，影响广及整个世界。她曾四次来到中国访问。在苏联，她是活着时就被树起雕像的第一个人。
    交谈中有人问：“您最不喜欢的是什么？”她回答说：“我最不喜欢虚伪和奉承。”我说：“您一九五一年访华，中国大诗人艾青为您写过一首赞美诗，非常有名，您不会把它当作奉承话吧？”她愉快地笑了：“不！那诗我一直保存着。诗人是真诚的。”
    话又从此生发开去，进入艺术领域。她回忆说，艾青写的是她根据舒曼乐章意境跳的一段芭蕾，“人在太空飞行”：仰头眺望前方，右手前伸，舞衣飘举如云霓。摄影家摄下的这个镜头传遍了世界，被认为是和平与宁静的象征。
    是的，乌兰诺娃的名字还代表着和平。
