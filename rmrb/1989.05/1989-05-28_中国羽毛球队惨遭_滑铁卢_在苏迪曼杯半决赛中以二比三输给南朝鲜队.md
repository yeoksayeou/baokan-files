China's badminton team suffered a major setback, losing 2-3 to the South Korean team in the semifinals of the first Sudirman Cup World Mixed Team Badminton Championships.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 27 - (Reporters Liang Jinxiong, Zhou Zhenxin) Due to the unexpected loss of a point by world women's doubles champions Lin Ying and Guan Weizhen, the Chinese team lost 2-3 to the South Korean team in the semifinals of the first Sudirman Cup World Mixed Team Badminton Championships tonight, missing out on the chance to compete in the final. The South Korean team will face Indonesia in the final tomorrow night. The Indonesian team won 5-0 against Denmark in the semifinals tonight.

The world mixed doubles champions Wang Pengren and Shi Fangqing were the first to take the court against opponents Park Joo-bong and Jeong Myeong-hee. They made too many mistakes and their coordination was disrupted, leading to a two-game loss with scores of 8-15 and 2-15.

Next, world men's and women's singles champions Han Aiping and Yang Yang won their respective singles matches 2-1 (9-12, 11-5, 11-0) and 2-0 (15-5, 15-7) against South Korea's Lee Young-sook and An So-chang, giving China a 2-1 lead. The crucial fourth match was the women's doubles. Lin Ying and Guan Weizhen, who had not lost a match in two years, made too many mistakes against the fierce attacks of Hwang Hye-young and Jeong So-young, losing 8-15 and 12-15 and dropping the point that everyone had expected them to win.

Li Yongbo, due to his regular partner Tian Bingyi being hospitalized with a high fever, had to pair with Chen Kang for the doubles match. Due to insufficient coordination time, Li Yongbo and Chen Kang lost 7-15 and 11-15 to the famous pair Park Joo-bong and Kim Moon-soo.

The Swedish team defeated England 5-0 today, securing their A-level team status, while England was demoted to B-level.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 26 - (Reporters Liang Jinxiong, Zhou Zhenxin) The final day of group stage matches for the first Sudirman Cup World Mixed Team Badminton Championships was held here today. Chinese Taipei, Scotland, New Zealand, Norway, and Bulgaria finished first in their respective C to Q levels. These five teams will each be promoted one level in the next cup competition.

　　中国羽毛球队惨遭“滑铁卢”
    在苏迪曼杯半决赛中以二比三输给南朝鲜队
    新华社雅加达５月２７日电  （记者梁金雄、周宗欣）由于世界女双冠军林瑛／关渭贞意外失去一分，中国队今晚在首届苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛半决赛中，以２∶３负于南朝鲜队，痛失决赛权。南朝鲜队明晚将同印度尼西亚队争夺苏迪曼杯。印尼队今晚在半决赛中以５∶０战胜了丹麦队。
    混双世界冠军王朋仁／史方静，首先登场迎战对手朴柱奉／郑明熙。他俩自己失误多，配合乱了章法，两局比赛一直处于落后、被动的局面，以８∶１５，２∶１５败北。
    接着，世界男、女单打冠军韩爱平和杨阳，在男、女单打赛中以２∶１（９∶１２、１１∶５、１１∶０）和２∶０（１５∶５、１５∶７）先后击败南朝鲜的李英淑和安哉昌，使中国队反以２∶１领先。关键是第四盘女双，两年未遭败绩的林瑛／关渭贞在黄惠英／郑素英凶猛的斩杀面前，失误超常，以８∶１５和１２∶１５失利，丢掉了赛前人们认为她俩必得的这一分。
    李永波由于老搭档田秉毅感冒发高烧住进了医院，只好同陈康配对打双打。因配合时间太短而不够默契，李永波／陈康以７∶１５和１１∶１５败给了名将朴柱奉／金文秀。
    瑞典队今天以５∶０战胜英格兰队，得以保留其Ａ级队资格，而英格兰队降至Ｂ级。
    据新华社雅加达５月２６日电　（记者梁金雄、周宗欣）首届苏迪曼杯世界羽毛球混合团体赛今天在这里进行小组赛最后一天的比赛。中国台北、苏格兰、新西兰、挪威和保加利亚队依次分别列Ｃ级至Ｑ级的第一名，这５个队将在下届杯赛时各晋升一级。
