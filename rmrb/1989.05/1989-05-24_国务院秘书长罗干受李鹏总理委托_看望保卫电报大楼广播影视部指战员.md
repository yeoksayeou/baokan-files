Secretary-General of the State Council Luo Gan, on behalf of Premier Li Peng, visited and comforted the soldiers and officers responsible for the security of the Beijing Telegraph Building, the Color TV Center, the Central People's Broadcasting Station, and the International Broadcasting Station.

Luo Gan said to the soldiers and officers, "In the chaotic situation in Beijing, you have encountered great difficulties in carrying out your duties. For several days, you have not been able to eat well, sleep well, or get any rest. You have strictly adhered to discipline, loved the capital, loved the people of the capital, and loved the young students. Your actions have gradually gained the understanding and support of young students and people from all walks of life. Now the order in the capital is being restored. We are confident that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and with the joint efforts of the broad masses of soldiers, public security officers, armed police, young students, and people from all walks of life, the capital Beijing will definitely be able to quickly restore normal living order and social order. We hope that all workers will support the soldiers and officers of the Liberation Army and jointly do a good job in the security of important departments."

Luo Gan also visited and comforted some colleagues who were on night duty at the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television.
