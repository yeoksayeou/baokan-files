This year, the theft of power facilities in Baoding City and County has continued to rise. As of March 29, 300 agricultural power transformers have been stolen, and 866,000 meters of power lines have been stolen, resulting in direct economic losses of over 5 million yuan. The destruction of agricultural power facilities has caused tens of thousands of acres of farmland to be unable to be irrigated, and the masses of farmers are full of complaints.

On the morning of March 10, inside the Dingxing County Power Bureau, a village head pounded his chest and cried, "Our village raised 140,000 yuan to buy a transformer, and it was stolen just a few days after it was installed. The village is very poor, and now it's time for spring irrigation. What are we going to use to irrigate the fields?" Some lawless elements, in order to make money, do not even care about their lives. Since last July, three lawless elements in Qingyuan County have died of electric shock while committing crimes.

Recently, the public security bureaus of various cities and counties have cracked down on a batch of cases and cleaned up and rectified some non-ferrous metal collection and smelting stalls, achieving some results. However, the problem of serious theft of rural power facilities has not been fundamentally solved.

　　保定农电设施被盗严重
    今年以来保定地、市电力设施被盗案件持续上升。截至３月２９日，农电变压器被盗３００台，电线被盗８６．６万米，直接经济损失达５００多万元。农电设施被破坏，造成几十万亩农田不能浇水，广大农民对此怨声载道。
    ３月１０日上午，在定兴县电力局内，一位村主任捶胸顿足地哭诉：“我们村集资１．４万元买了一台变压器，刚安装完没几天就被偷走了，村里很穷，眼下又要春灌，让我们拿什么浇地呀！”一些不法分子为了捞钱，连命都不顾。去年７月以来，清苑县有３名不法分子在作案时触电身亡。
    前些时候，各市、县公安局已破获了一批案件，并清理整顿了部分有色金属收购、冶炼摊点，取得了一些效果。但是，农村电力设施严重被盗的问题没有根本解决。
