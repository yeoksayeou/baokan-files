Wan Li, who is visiting Canada, said today in Toronto, "We must resolutely protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people, and at the same time, firmly maintain the stability of social order."

Wan Li made the above remarks at a banquet held by the Chinese community in Toronto when discussing the demonstrations by Chinese students.

Wan Li said that the patriotic enthusiasm of Chinese students is precious. They hope to promote democracy and combat corruption, which is in line with the government's goals and efforts.

He then emphasized, "These issues should be resolved within the framework of democracy and the rule of law, and should be addressed in a rational and orderly manner."

Wan Li expressed his belief that the Chinese government "can handle the situation calmly, rationally, and with restraint, overcome difficulties, and properly resolve the problems."

Wan Li's remarks were warmly welcomed by the more than 500 Chinese and overseas Chinese present at the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, May 21st.

Wan Li, who is visiting Canada, said today when discussing the issue of peaceful reunification of the motherland, "In recent years, the relationship between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has undergone significant changes. The long-term tense standoff and mutual isolation have begun to change, and economic and cultural exchanges and personnel exchanges between the two sides are increasing."

Wan Li hopes that the authorities in Taiwan will quickly abandon the unreasonable policy of "no contact, no negotiations, no compromise," and that both sides will directly engage in "trade, mail, and transportation."

He also expressed his belief that with the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides, the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan will continue to develop, and the great cause of national reunification will definitely be realized.

According to statistics, from 1979 to the end of last year, the cumulative amount of indirect trade between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait has reached 8 billion US dollars.
