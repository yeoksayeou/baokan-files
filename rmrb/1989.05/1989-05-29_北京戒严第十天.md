Beijing Under Martial Law for the Tenth Day

	The People's Daily, Beijing, May 30, 1989

	Yesterday marked the tenth day since martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. The city's residents continued to live in relative calm, with no protest marches on Chang'an Avenue. However, students who had been staging a sit-in at Tiananmen Square showed no signs of leaving, having set up more tourist tents and even begun constructing a plaster statue.

	On some streets, sanitation workers removed posters that had been stuck on lampposts and in corners, while on other streets, new posters appeared, with onlookers and discussants still occasionally seen.

	Given that the social order in the areas under martial law in Beijing has gradually returned to normal, the "Beijing Under Martial Law for the Xth Day" column in this newspaper will no longer appear daily. Future related news will be reported to readers in other forms as necessary.

　　北京戒严第十天
    本报北京５月３０日凌晨讯  昨天是北京部分地区宣布戒严的第十天。首都市民生活仍然比较平静，长安街上没有出现游行队伍。但另一方面，天安门广场上静坐请愿学生却未见撤走的迹象，还新搭了一批旅游帐篷，并正在安装一座石膏塑像。
    在一些街道上，部分清洁工人清洗掉了贴在灯杆、墙角的传单，而另一些街道上，又有些新贴的传单，围观、议论者仍时有所见。
    鉴于北京宣布戒严地区的社会秩序已日益正常，本报《北京戒严第×天》专栏，已无每天出现的必要。今后有关新闻，将随时用别的报道方式向读者介绍。
