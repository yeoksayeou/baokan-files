Ramiz Alia Praises Small Livestock Herds and Vegetable Gardens

    Ramiz Alia, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labour, on May 4 once again emphasized the need to increase the proportion of small livestock herds and vegetable gardens in rural areas, and to ensure the supply of meat and vegetables to both urban and rural populations.

    Alia made this statement during an inspection tour of the Ferri district. Small livestock herds and vegetable gardens are a form of collective production that has developed in Albania in recent years, allowing members of the collective or farm workers to purchase meat and vegetables at cost price, with surplus products also available for urban supply. This approach differs from the past practice of abolishing private livestock and gardens, and it effectively motivates the members of the collective.

    After learning about the situation regarding small livestock herds and vegetable gardens, Alia pointed out that one should not be satisfied with some statistical figures; instead, efforts should be made to further expand and consolidate these initiatives until the needs are met. This has important economic and social significance.

    He stressed that the development and consolidation of small livestock herds are not just organizational issues but are related to the supply of goods to urban and rural populations.

    Alia criticized some local officials for not fully understanding the significance of developing small livestock herds and vegetable gardens, stating that if some farm managers do not like it but the workers do, then the workers' wishes should be met without hesitation.

    Currently, the vast majority of production teams in Albania have established small livestock herds and vegetable gardens, which have played an active role in improving the supply for collective members and reducing the pressure on urban supplies.

　　阿利雅称赞小牧群和小菜园
    新华社地拉那５月５日电  阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央第一书记阿利雅４日再次强调要提高农村中小牧群和小菜园的比重，搞好城乡肉类和蔬菜供应。
    阿利雅是４日在视察费里区时提出这一要求的。小牧群和小菜园是近年来在阿尔巴尼亚发展起来的一种集体自留畜和自留地性质的生产组织形式，以成本价向本队的社员或农场工人供应肉类和蔬菜，剩余产品也可供应城市，这与过去取消自留畜和自留地的做法不同，能调动社员的积极性。
    阿利雅在了解了有关小牧群和小菜园的情况后指出，不要满足于一些统计数字，要进一步扩大和巩固，直至满足需要，这具有重要的经济和社会意义。
    他强调，发展和巩固小牧群不只是个组织问题，它事关城乡人民的供应。
    阿利雅批评了有些地方干部不能完全理解发展小牧群和小菜园的意义，说如果有的农场干部不喜欢，而职工们喜欢，那就应当毫不犹豫地满足职工们的愿望。
    阿尔巴尼亚目前的绝大多数生产队已建立起小牧群和小菜园，对改善社员供应、减轻城市供应压力起了积极作用。
