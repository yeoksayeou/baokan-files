Publishing foreign literature should emphasize social benefits. Xinhua News Agency, Zhuhai. (Reporter Zhang Yusheng) A conference on the translation and publication of foreign literature, organized by 22 publishers including People's Literature, Yilin, Huacheng, and Lijiang, was recently held in Zhuhai, Guangdong. The attendees issued an appeal to all publishers and magazine editors across the country involved in the translation and publication of foreign literature, urging them to strengthen professional ethics and social responsibility, overcome the tendency to prioritize profit, and resolutely eliminate obscene and pornographic publications.

At this Zhuhai meeting, the 22 publishers discussed measures to optimize topic selection, improve quality, and rectify the order of foreign literature publication. The publishing industry representatives present believed that to ensure the healthy development of foreign literature publication work, they hope that the news and publishing management departments will promptly formulate necessary regulations and administrative rules. At the same time, the publishing departments should also, based on the current supply and demand situation of the book market, actively take a self-disciplined approach, strengthen professional ethics, and consciously rectify the order of foreign literature publication.
