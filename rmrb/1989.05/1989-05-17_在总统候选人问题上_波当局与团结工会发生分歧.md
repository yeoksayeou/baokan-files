In the face of the approaching Polish elections, a disagreement has emerged between the Polish authorities and the Solidarity Union over the issue of the presidential candidate.

On May 14, the Polish National Election Commission released the list of candidates for the next parliamentary elections. The leaders of the ruling party and various major political and social organizations were included in the list, but notably, the first secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party and chairman of the Council of State, Jaruzelski, was not included.

Regarding this, Ryszard Rewski, a member of the Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party and a representative of the authorities at the "Round Table Conference," stated in an interview with reporters on the same day that the reason Jaruzelski was not included in the list of candidates for the next parliamentary elections is that he has been nominated as the presidential candidate. He said that this personnel arrangement had been accepted by all parties at the "Round Table Conference."

On May 16, the spokesperson for Solidarity Union Chairman Lech Wałęsa, Nowina-Konopka, claimed that at the "Round Table Conference," the Solidarity Union and its chairman, Lech Wałęsa, had not made any decision regarding the nomination of a presidential candidate.

　　在总统候选人问题上    
    波当局与团结工会发生分歧
    新华社华沙５月１６日电（记者汤德乔）在波兰大选日益临近之际，波兰当局与团结工会在总统候选人问题上发生了分歧。
    ５月１４日波兰全国选举委员会公布了下届议会议员全国候选人名单。波兰执政党和各主要政治、社会团体的领导人都被列入名单，但唯独波兰统一工人党中央第一书记、国务委员会主席雅鲁泽尔斯基例外，没有被列入名单。
    对此，波兰统一工人党政治局委员、出席“圆桌会议”的当局代表雷伊科夫斯基当天在接受记者采访时说，雅鲁泽尔斯基未被列入下届议会议员全国候选人名单的原因是，他已被推荐为波兰总统候选人。他说，这一人事安排在“圆桌会议”上已被各方代表接受。
    ５月１６日，团结工会主席瓦文萨的发言人诺维纳一科诺普卡声称，在“圆桌会议”上团结工会及其主席瓦文萨没有作出关于推荐总统候选人的任何决定。
