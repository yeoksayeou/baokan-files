Premier Zhou Enlai's Speech

Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

　　Today is the glorious tenth anniversary of the founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese government, I extend warm congratulations to the people and government of Yugoslavia.

　　The heroic people of all nationalities of Yugoslavia have a glorious revolutionary tradition. They waged a long and valiant struggle against foreign oppression. During the Second World War, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, the people of all nationalities of Yugoslavia took up arms and fought the fascist occupiers for four years in order to win national independence and freedom. Finally, with the support of the Soviet Union and the people of the world in the anti-fascist struggle, they liberated their own territory and overthrew the regime of landlords and the bourgeoisie, establishing the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia on this day ten years ago. This historic victory of the Yugoslav people once inspired the Chinese people who were then engaged in the liberation struggle.

　　Over the past ten years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, now the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav government, the people of all nationalities of Yugoslavia have overcome various difficulties, restored and developed the national economy, and improved the material and cultural living standards of the working people. As a result, Yugoslavia is advancing along the road of socialist industrialization. Yugoslavia's peaceful foreign policy of promoting international peaceful coexistence, collective security, and disarmament is having an increasingly positive impact on easing international tensions and safeguarding world peace. The Chinese people are particularly pleased to see the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The Soviet-Yugoslav talks held in May and June this year and the agreements reached are not only in line with the vital interests of the people of both countries, but also in line with the fundamental interests of socialism and the noble cause of world peace.

　　The people of China and Yugoslavia are friendly. Even in the years when we were engaged in our respective revolutionary wars, we gave each other infinite sympathy and concern. The Chinese people are particularly grateful for Yugoslavia's consistent and just attitude in supporting China's restoration of its seat in the United Nations and exercising its sovereignty over Taiwan. Since the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between our two countries, the friendly relations between the two peoples have developed rapidly. The two sides have sent various delegations such as trade unions, arts, and news to visit each other, thereby enhancing mutual understanding. Since our two peoples have the common goals of defending world peace and building socialism, and both take Marxism-Leninism as the guide for action, it can be believed that the friendly and cooperative relations between our two countries will be fully developed.

　　I propose a toast:

　　To the prosperity and strength of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!

　　To the friendly cooperation between the peoples of China and Yugoslavia!

　　To the health of Comrade Tito, President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!

专栏：

　　周恩来总理的讲话亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年的光辉节日。我代表中国人民和中国政府向南斯拉夫人民和南斯拉夫政府表示热烈的祝贺。
    英雄的南斯拉夫各族人民具有光荣的革命传统。他们为了反抗外来的压迫，曾经进行过长期的英勇斗争。在第二次世界大战期间，南斯拉夫各族人民在南斯拉夫共产党领导下，为争取民族的独立和自由，拿起武器同法西斯占领者进行了四年的武装斗争，终于在苏联和全世界人民反法西斯斗争的支援下，解放了自己的国土，并且推翻了地主、资产阶级的政权，在十年前的今天成立了南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国。南斯拉夫人民这一历史性的胜利，曾经鼓舞了当时正在从事解放斗争的中国人民。
    十年来，南斯拉夫各族人民在南斯拉夫共产党也就是现在的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟，和南斯拉夫政府的领导下，曾经克服了种种困难，恢复和发展了国民经济，提高了劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平，从而，使南斯拉夫正在沿着社会主义工业化的道路前进。南斯拉夫的促进国际和平共处、集体安全和裁减军备的和平外交政策，对于和缓国际紧张局势和维护世界和平，正产生日益有利的影响。中国人民特别高兴看到苏南两国关系的改善。今年五六月间举行的苏南会谈和所达成的协议，不仅符合苏南两国人民的切身利益，而且也符合于社会主义和世界和平这一崇高事业的根本利益。
    中南两国人民是友好的。还在各自进行革命战争的年代里，我们就曾经相互寄予无限的同情和关怀。中国人民特别感激南斯拉夫一贯支持中国恢复在联合国的地位和行使对台湾的主权的正义态度。自从我们两个国家正式建交以后，两国人民间的友好关系更有了迅速的发展。双方派出了工会、艺术、新闻等各种代表团进行相互访问，从而增进了彼此的了解。由于我们两国人民有着保卫世界和平和建设社会主义的共同目标，并且都以马克思列宁主义作为行动的指导，因此，可以相信，我们两国间的友好合作关系必将得到全面的发展。
    我提议：
    为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的繁荣和富强，
    为中南两国人民的友好合作，
    为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托同志的健康干杯！（附图片）
