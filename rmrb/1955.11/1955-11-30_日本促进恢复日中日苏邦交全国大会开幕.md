　　Kuno Fusanosuke delivered the opening address at the conference. He said that based on the visits of many representatives to the Soviet Union and China, as well as his own experiences in China, the Soviet Union and China would absolutely not invade Japan. He expressed hope that the participating representatives would conduct thorough discussions on various issues related to the early restoration of Soviet-Japanese and Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, ensuring the success of the conference.

　　Speeches were also delivered at the conference by Hiratsuka Tsunejiro, Suzuki Mosaburo, Kuroda Hisao, Nosaka Sanzō, and many other representatives from various sectors.

　　Subsequently, Majima Kan, Secretary-General of the National Council for the Restoration of Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese Diplomatic Relations, gave a report. He said that the Soviet Union's desire to restore diplomatic relations with Japan stemmed entirely from its peaceful policy.

　　He pointed out that the idea of "two Chinas" was absolutely unacceptable to China, and the Taiwan issue was entirely China's internal affair. He emphasized that China was no longer the China of the past, and neglecting this fact would make it impossible to resolve the issues between China and Japan. The governments of China and Japan should engage in direct consultations.

　　He concluded by saying that this conference was a conference of the people and should transform the demands of all sectors of society into a force to promote the normalization of Soviet-Japanese and Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.

　　In the afternoon, the conference held group discussions on political issues such as territory and war criminals, economic and trade issues, fisheries issues, and cultural exchange issues. The conference was scheduled to continue on the 29th.

    新华社二十九日讯　东京消息：日本政界、经济界、文化界和各种群众团体著名人士发起召开的日本促进恢复日中、日苏邦交全国大会，已经在十一月二十八日在东京开幕。
    参加大会的有全国一百八十多个团体的代表约二百人。其中有日本恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议会长久原房之助、最高顾问风见章、事务总长马岛僴、关西分会会长小畑忠良，自由民主党顾问楢桥渡，社会党主席铃木茂三郎、参议员高田愿子，劳农党主席黑田寿男，日本共产党第一书记野坂参三，大日本水产会会长平冢常次郎，副会长饭山太平，日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏，中日贸易会专务理事铃木一雄，中央农业会会长永井健，日本工会总评议会副主席今村彰，日中友好协会副会长内山完造，日苏亲善协会会长户泽铁彦，日本拥护和平委员会总书记平野义太郎，民主主义科学者协会干事长柘植秀臣等人。
    久原房之助在大会上首先致词。他说：从许多代表们的访问中苏和我亲身到中国所看到的情况看来，苏联和中国绝对不会侵略日本。他希望与会代表就如何早日恢复日苏、日中邦交的各种问题，进行充分的讨论，使这次大会获得成功。
    在大会上致词的还有平冢常次郎、铃木茂三郎、黑田寿男、野坂参三以及其他各界代表多人。
