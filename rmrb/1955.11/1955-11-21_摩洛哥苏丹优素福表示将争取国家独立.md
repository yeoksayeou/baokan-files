Xinhua News Agency, November 20th dispatch from Paris: Parisian newspapers reported on the 19th that the newly reinstated Moroccan Sultan Yusuf delivered a royal address in Rabat, the Moroccan capital, on the 18th. He reiterated the Moroccan people's desire for independence. He said that the government he intends to form will begin negotiations with the French government, and he will terminate the trusteeship and protectorate system in Morocco.

　　Sultan Yusuf also pointed out: "The new relationship of interdependence between Morocco and France, based on equality and mutual respect for sovereignty, is not incompatible with maintaining spiritual and cultural ties with other Arab countries."

　　Yusuf finally expressed his willingness to guarantee "the interests, rights, and personal status of French citizens in Morocco, as long as they respect Moroccan sovereignty."

　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris: Moroccan Sultan Yusuf returned by plane to Rabat, the Moroccan capital, on the morning of November 16th, after being forced to leave two years ago. The Sultan, who was exiled to Madagascar by the French authorities in 1953 for sympathizing with the national independence movement, was warmly welcomed by people from all over Morocco.

　　During his stay in France, Yusuf held several meetings with French and Moroccan politicians (including de Gaulle). According to "Combat," de Gaulle suggested that Yusuf strive to cancel the American military bases in Morocco.

　　According to an Associated Press report, Yusuf told reporters in Paris on the 13th that the issue of establishing American bases in Morocco had never been discussed with him, and the government he would form after returning home would definitely investigate the matter.

　　摩洛哥苏丹优素福表示将争取国家独立
    新华社二十日讯　据塔斯社巴黎消息：巴黎报纸十九日报道，新近复位的摩洛哥苏丹优素福十八日在摩洛哥首府拉巴特发表御前演说。他重申摩洛哥人民争取独立的愿望。他说，他打算成立的政府将同法国政府开始谈判，他将终止在摩洛哥的托管和保护制度。
    苏丹优素福还指出：“摩洛哥和法国之间以平等和互相尊重主权为基础的新的互相依赖的关系，与同其他阿拉伯国家维持精神和文化的联系并不是互不相容的。”
    优素福最后表明愿意保障“法国在摩洛哥的公民的利益、权利和个人地位，只要他们尊重摩洛哥的主权”。
    据新华社讯　巴黎消息：摩洛哥苏丹优素福已经在十一月十六日上午乘飞机回到他被迫离开了两年的摩洛哥首府拉巴特。这位因为同情民族独立运动而在一九五三年被法国当局放逐到马达加斯加的苏丹受到摩洛哥各地人民的热烈欢迎。
    优素福在法国停留期间，曾经同法国和摩洛哥的政治家（包括戴高乐在内）举行了多次会谈。据“战斗报”的消息说，戴高乐曾经建议优素福争取取消美国在摩洛哥的军事基地。
    据美联社消息，优素福十三日在巴黎曾经对记者说，关于在摩洛哥建立美国基地的问题从来没有同他商量过，他回国后成立的政府一定要调查这个问题。
