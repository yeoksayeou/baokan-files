“Pragmatism—The Philosophy of Imperialism”
—Introducing Wells' Critique of Pragmatism
Yang Xianbang

    Wells' work "Pragmatism—The Philosophy of Imperialism" has been translated into Chinese and is now available to Chinese readers. In the campaign to criticize bourgeois idealism, this book will undoubtedly attract the attention of China's academic circles and strengthen the firepower of this struggle.

    This book was published in New York, USA, in 1954. Its author, Dr. Harry Wells, is a well-known American Marxist, a talented researcher, and a political commentator. This book broadly touches upon the fields of economics, politics, law, history, education, and psychology. It not only criticizes the philosophical errors of pragmatism but also profoundly reveals its class essence. It analyzes the social and ideological roots of pragmatism, its essence and characteristics, exposes its socio-political role, its influence on all aspects of American life and thought, and its impact on the programs and policies implemented by the United States. This is a thorough and comprehensive critique of pragmatism. The entire book proves to us an unshakable conclusion: pragmatism is the philosophy of imperialism.

    The book consists of thirteen chapters, narrating the historical overview of the emergence of pragmatism in the 1870s, analyzing the economic background of pragmatism and its further decadence in various eras, and criticizing the three main representatives of pragmatist philosophy—Peirce, James, and Dewey, with particular emphasis on criticizing James and Dewey, including James' psychology and Dewey's pedagogy. In addition, it also criticizes Fiske, the representative of pragmatism in history, and Holmes, the representative in law.

    On the issue of criticism, the important issue is the method of criticism. The most important method of Marxist criticism is the method of class analysis. Philosophy has partisanship. For a philosophy, it is necessary to investigate the class forces and political background it reflects in order to carry out powerful criticism in theory. Wells, based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, elucidated the socio-economic roots and class essence of pragmatism. He pointed out: The period between 1860 and 1878 was the period when pragmatism was forming. Later was the period when pragmatism grew and became strong. The socio-economic conditions of this period, as Lenin pointed out in "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism": "The 1860s and 1870s are the highest and final stage in the development of free competition." And "At the end of the nineteenth century, during the boom and the crisis of 1900-1903, cartels had become the basis of the whole of economic life. Capitalism had become imperialism." Lenin was talking about the development of the entire capitalist world towards imperialism, and the United States was no exception.

    What kind of ideological system would such an era produce? Wells quoted Marx: "From now on, the question is no longer whether this theory or that theory conforms to the truth, but only whether it is beneficial or harmful to capital, convenient or inconvenient, whether it violates the police regulations or not." Marx was talking about British and French economics, but he also pointed out the characteristics of the entire bourgeois ideology after taking power. American bourgeois thinkers infiltrated this principle of convenience and usefulness into all aspects of ideology, forming the philosophy of the American bourgeoisie. The central idea of this philosophy, its basic principles, its essence, is "existence is effect" and "truth is usefulness." In this book, Wells details the formation and development of pragmatism, providing Chinese readers unfamiliar with these details with very useful historical materials and analysis.

    The theory and method of pragmatism are extremely clever. It rarely states its true position and is good at circumvention. Wells used the greatest strength and outstanding talent to sort out the clues in the tedious chaos, reveal its essence, and point out its profound deception.

    The deceptive technique of pragmatism lies in its three-step argumentation. Every pragmatist extends these three-step arguments to all fields—whether in the field of philosophy, or in the fields of history, law, education, economics, and politics. These three steps of argumentation are: The first step is to oppose what should be opposed, to "struggle" against absolute idealism or supernatural theological views, showing a "progressive" and "scientific" appearance. Under the cover of this "struggle," in the name of attacking all "metaphysics" (pragmatists understand this term as theories about existence independent of people's experience), they attack the view of the material world, attack materialism and the foundation of science. The first step clears the way for the second step, and the second step is to replace scientific methods with pragmatic methods, and replace truth with the principle of convenience. The last step is to restore the content of previous philosophy and theology, smuggling in through the back door what was driven out of the front door, although the form may be slightly different, the content is the same. Therefore, pragmatist philosophers are disguised theological salesmen, brokers hired by the bourgeoisie, and they are by no means seekers of truth.

    Wells pointed out that the reason why pragmatism uses this three-step argument to deceive is that the old supernatural theology has become outdated. It is threatened by the fighting working class and science (especially the theory of evolution), and the entire working people are no longer deceived by it. Therefore, bourgeois philosophers have to find a new and effective method, a method that superficially attacks the old theology, but actually preserves its basic content. This can fully meet the historical requirements of the bourgeoisie. The deceptiveness and poisonousness of the three-step argument lies in this.

    Chapter Nine, "Dewey's Instrumentalism," is a very brilliant chapter. In this chapter, Wells especially pays attention to exposing the hypocrisy of Dewey's argument.

    Dewey's three-step argument is as follows. The first step: attack science and the material world under the cover of attacking all "metaphysics." Here, Dewey pretends to be attacking the metaphysics of idealism, because this metaphysics admits the supernatural "pre-existing existence." However, when Dewey attacks this argument, he denies all knowledge about objects that exist independently of human consciousness, denying that knowledge is a reflection of the objective world. Therefore, the real target he attacks here is scientific materialism. This clears the way to the second step.

    The second step: replace the truly scientific method with the instrumentalist method. Dewey here starts by attacking the "pure reason" of objective idealism. However, Dewey's real enemy is not "pure reason." Under the cover of abandoning "pure reason," Dewey abandons objective laws, abandons true reason, denies scientific theories, attacks all true scientific methods, especially Marxist science, and replaces them with the instrumentalist method. This method believes that truth is the means to achieve the goal, is the most convenient and effective man-made hypothesis, rather than a reflection of objective laws. This destroys the objective foundation of theory and replaces truth with convenience. This not only has no conflict with religion, but also leads to religion.

    The third step of Dewey's argument is to smuggle in what was driven out in the first step: reconcile religion and science. Dewey believes that the reason why science conflicts with religion and idealism is that all three insist that they can know independent reality. His solution to this problem is not to eliminate religion and idealism, and maintain science and materialism, but to eliminate independent reality, eliminate materialism, destroy the theoretical foundation of true science, and maintain idealism and religion, so that science surrenders to religion. In this way, there is no need to reconcile religion and science anymore, because their reconciliation has been completed on the basis of idealism. Thus, the third step is completed. What was attacked in the first step has been restored.

    Dewey's philosophy of experience and its instrumentalism are sophisticated subjective idealism that inevitably leads to religion. This is the true face of pragmatism that Wells reveals from the infinitely chaotic pragmatist lies.

    All the above tricks are carried out under the concept of "experience." Therefore, Wells emphasized that the word "experience" covers up many evils of pragmatism, just as Lenin said: "Now all kinds of professor philosophies are making a big fuss about 'experience' to cover up their reactionary nature." ("Materialism and Empirio-criticism")

    Wells not only exposed all the reactionary nature of Dewey's use of "experience" to "transform" philosophy, but also exposed his use of "experience" to "transform" social theory. Wells pointed out that Dewey constitutes the theory of society, morality and education into a syllogism: all social problems are moral problems; all moral problems are educational problems; therefore, all social problems are educational problems. And the main task of education is to maintain the status quo, not to change it. Therefore, Dewey's entire argument is to preserve the eternal rule of capitalism.

    Wells further pointed out: The highest peak of Dewey's entire philosophy lies in the "transformation" of religion. He opposes supernatural religion, but he believes that the world is unknowable, dangerous, and uncertain. Only "obedience and respect" are needed for this fickle world; human behavior "is invading the unknown field," "good things are obtained by God's grace, not by ourselves." In this world, "visible things are arranged among invisible things; in the final analysis, what is invisible determines what happens among visible things." Mankind is like "sitting in the same boat, crossing the same turbulent ocean. The potential religious significance of this fact is infinite." In this way, Dewey makes religion permeate all fields of life, thus making people regress to a state of ignorance and permanent slavery. Establishing this religion is the main goal of Dewey's entire philosophy, its core, and its highest peak. This kind of religion is needed by the bourgeoisie, especially in the age of imperialism. Dewey is indeed the highest apologist for American imperialism and a disguised theological trafficker.

    Therefore, Wells pointed out that pragmatism is not only a method, but also a theory. Pragmatists insist that pragmatism is only a method, not a theory, which is a technique to cover up its true face. According to the theory of pragmatism, reactionary scholars can start from reactionary interests and rationalize any fabrication in economics, society, politics, psychology, and science.

    In the last chapter of the book, "The Philosophy of Imperialism," Wells summarized the analysis of the entire book and made the following expression of the characteristics of pragmatism:

    "Pragmatism is the main philosophy of American capitalism in the age of imperialism. It is the idealistic worldview of the complacent bourgeoisie. It combines method and theory. The method of pragmatism is purely empirical, relying on opportunistic, expedient and opportunistic means to achieve goals. The theory of pragmatism is a subjective idealism belonging to the positivist type. It takes a subjective, obscurantist, and fabricated view of life. In short, pragmatism is a class weapon that defends cruelty, ignorance, and superstition. In terms of method and theory, it is opposed to dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and aims to oppose the working class and its allies who are fighting for liberation."

    Pragmatism is the worldview of the American monopoly bourgeoisie and at the same time the spiritual weapon of this class against the workers' movement. Wells said: "No member of society, including workers, can avoid being affected by the corrosive influence of pragmatism. It penetrates into his consciousness through an infinite variety of channels. It invades his family through radio, newspapers, and children's education. It penetrates into his trade union through misleading trade union leaders and hired spies."

    This is because pragmatism eliminates knowledge and theory, making practice a blind action without the guidance of scientific theory. It separates the worker's practical activities from revolutionary theory, deviates from long-term theoretical guidance, and turns the workers' movement into economism and trade unionism, bound within the capitalist system and unable to go beyond its scope. It helps the labor aristocracy combine trade union policies with the domestic and foreign policies and programs of Wall Street bosses, selling out the working class. Precisely because of this, pragmatism is first of all the philosophy of imperialism, and at the same time the theoretical basis of American social democracy (the agent of the imperialists in the working class), and Dewey is first of all the most important philosopher of imperialism, and at the same time the most important philosopher of American social democracy.

    When summarizing the social role of pragmatism, Wells pointed out that the anti-rational principles and expediency of pragmatism truly reflect the class characteristics of the monopoly capitalists. This class can only act according to convenience, and cannot rely on objective laws, but only on its own will and wishes, both in terms of goals and the means to achieve them. The domestic and foreign policies of imperialism are not based on scientific knowledge, but on the convenience of achieving goals by any means, based on pragmatism. No principles, only convenience, this is the characteristic and task of pragmatism. This characteristic and task directly paved the way for war policies, power politics, and fascism. Fascist leader Mussolini once praised James as his "teacher." He said: "James's pragmatism is very useful in my political career. James taught me that an action should be judged by its results, not by the basis of its doctrine. I learned from James confidence in action, a strong will to live and struggle, and most of the success of fascism depends on these. I think the most important thing is action." (Page 154 of this book) Therefore, Wells bitterly denounced pragmatism. He said: "It (pragmatism—author) is a Nietzschean philosophy of superman, without good and evil, without truth and falsehood, without humanity. It is the philosophy of the dying class that is heading for a dead end." (Page 247 of this book) He pointed out that pragmatism is not only the most ferocious enemy of Marxism, but also the most insidious and evil enemy of peace, democracy, and progressive humanity in the world.

    The book's criticism of pragmatism is sharp and thorough, and at the same time, this criticism is carried out by relying on meticulous analysis and rigorous argumentation, so it has a strong persuasiveness. The author does not simply extract a few words from the representative figures of pragmatist philosophy to scold them, but conducts scientific debates on their arguments and theoretical systems, thus refuting them thoroughly. Therefore, this book implements the principle of party spirit, and this party spirit is inseparable from a scientific attitude. Secondly, the author pays great attention to the relationship between pragmatist philosophy and real politics, and implements the method of linking theory with practice in criticism. These are two very prominent advantages of this book. So far, this is still the most systematic and in-depth book we have seen in the works criticizing pragmatism. Chinese Marxists and American Marxists are on the same front. In the common struggle against pragmatism, Chinese readers will read this book of our American comrades with great interest.

    “实用主义—帝国主义的哲学”
    ——介绍威尔斯批判实用主义的著作
    杨宪邦
    威尔斯的著作“实用主义—帝国主义的哲学”一书已译成中文，同我国读者见面了。在开展批判资产阶级唯心主义的斗争中，这本书无疑将受到我国学术界的注意，并且为这次斗争加强一分战斗的火力。
    这本书是一九五四年在美国纽约出版的。它的作者哈利·威尔斯博士是美国有名的马克思主义者、有才干的研究家和政论家。本书广泛地涉及到经济、政治、法律、历史、教育、心理各个领域，它不仅批判了实用主义在哲学上所犯的错误，而且还深刻地揭发了它的阶级实质。它分析了实用主义哲学产生的社会根源和思想根源，它的本质和特征，揭露了它的社会政治作用，它在美国生活和思想各方面的影响以及它对美国所执行的纲领和政策的影响。这是对实用主义的彻底和全面地批判，全书给我们证明了一个不可动摇的结论：实用主义是帝国主义的哲学。
    全书共十三章，叙述了十九世纪七十年代实用主义产生的历史概况，分析了实用主义的经济背景及其在各个时代的进一步的颓废堕落，批判了实用主义哲学的三个主要代表——皮耳士、詹姆士、杜威，特别着重批判了詹姆士和杜威，包括詹姆士的心理学和杜威的教育学，此外也批判了实用主义在历史学上的代表费斯克和在法律学上的代表霍尔姆斯。
    在批判问题上，重要的问题是批判的方法问题。马克思主义批判的方法最重要的是阶级分析方法。哲学是有党派性的，对于一种哲学必须追究它所反映的阶级力量和政治背景，才能在理论上进行有力的批判。威尔斯依据马克思列宁主义的原则阐明了实用主义产生的社会经济根源和阶级实质。他指出：在一八六○与一八七八年之间是实用主义正在形成的时期。以后是实用主义成长壮大的时期。这时期的社会经济条件，如列宁在“帝国主义论”中所指出的：“十九世纪六十年代和七十年代，是自由竞争制发展中的最高的终极阶段。”而“在十九世纪末期的高涨和一九○○至一九○三年间的危机时，卡德尔已经成了全部经济生活底一种基础。资本主义变成为帝国主义了。”列宁所说的是整个资本主义世界向帝国主义发展的情形，而美国不是例外。
    这种时代的特点究竟会产生一种什么样的思想体系呢？威尔斯引证马克思的话：“从此以往，成为问题的，已经不是这个理论还是那个理论合于真理的问题，只是它于资本有益还是有害，便利还是不便利，违背警章还是不违背警章的问题。”马克思谈的是英法的经济学，但他同时也指出了取得政权后整个资产阶级思想意识的特性。美国的资产阶级思想家们便把这方便和有用的原则渗入思想意识的各个方面，形成美国资产阶级的哲学。这个哲学的中心思想，它的基本原则，它的本质，就是“存在就是效果”、“真理就是有用”。威尔斯在这本书里，详述了实用主义的形成和发展过程，给不熟悉这些细节的中国读者提供了很有用的史料和分析。
    实用主义的理论和方法是极巧妙的，它很少说出自己的真实立场，善于绕弯子。威尔斯用了最大的力量和卓越的才干，才在烦琐混乱之中理出头绪，揭露出它的本质，指出它深刻的欺骗。
    实用主义欺骗的技巧就在于它的三步论证。每个实用主义者都把这三步论证推广到一切领域，——不论是哲学的领域，或是在历史、法律、教育、经济和政治的领域。这三步论证就是：第一步是反对本来应该反对的东西，对绝对唯心论或超自然的神学观点进行“斗争”，显出“进步”和“科学”的样子。在这“斗争”的掩护下，以攻击一切“形而上学”（实用主义者把这名词了解为关于脱离人们经验而独立的存在的理论）为名，来攻击关于物质世界的观点，攻击唯物论和科学的基础。第一步给第二步扫清了道路，而第二步是用实用主义的方法来代替科学的方法，用方便原则代替真理。最后一步是重新恢复以前哲学和神学的内容，把从前门赶出去的东西从后门偷运进来，虽然形式或有小异，但内容却是相同。所以，实用主义哲学家是伪装的神学推销员，是资产阶级所雇用的经纪人，他们决不是真理的追求者。
    威尔斯指出，实用主义之所以用这三步论证进行欺骗，是由于旧的超自然的神学已经陈腐了，它受到战斗的工人阶级和科学（特别是进化论）的威胁，全体劳动人民不再受它的欺骗了。因此，资产阶级哲学家们不得不找一种新的有效方法，一种表面上是打击旧的神学，但实际上保存它的基本内容的方法。这是完全能够满足资产阶级的历史要求的。三步论证的欺骗性和毒狠就在于此。
    第九章“杜威底工具主义”是很精彩的一章，在这一章里，威尔斯特别注意揭露了杜威这种论证的虚伪。
    杜威三步论证是这样的。第一步：在攻击一切
  “形而上学”的掩护下来进攻科学和物质世界。在这里杜威装着是在攻击唯心主义的形而上学，因为这种形而上学承认超自然的“居先的存在”，可是杜威在攻击这种论点时，却否定一切关于离人意识而独立存在的客体的知识，否认知识是客观世界的反映。所以，他在这里真正攻击的目标是科学的唯物主义。这就扫清了走到第二步的道路。
    第二步：以工具主义的方法代替真正科学的方法。杜威在这里是从进攻客观唯心论的“纯粹理性”开始的。但是，杜威的真正敌人不是“纯粹理性”。杜威是在抛弃“纯粹理性”的掩护下，抛弃了客观规律，抛弃了真正的理性，否认科学的理论，攻击一切真正的科学方法，特别是马克思主义科学，而代之以工具主义的方法。这种方法认为，真理就是达到目的的手段，就是最方便最有效的人造的假设，而不是客观规律的反映。这就摧毁了理论的客观基础，用方便性代替真理。这不但和宗教没有冲突，并且通向宗教。
    杜威论证的第三步，是把第一步赶出去的东西偷运进来：调和宗教和科学。杜威认为，科学之所以和宗教、唯心论相冲突，是因为三者都坚持说它们能知道独立的现实。他解决这问题的办法，不是消灭宗教和唯心论，维护科学和唯物论，而是消灭独立现实，消灭唯物论，破坏真正科学的理论基础，而维护唯心论和宗教，使科学向宗教投降，这样，也就不用再调和宗教和科学了，因为它们的调和已在唯心论的基础上完成了。于是第三步完成了。第一步中所攻击的东西又恢复了。
    杜威的经验哲学以及它的工具主义乃是必然通向宗教的精制的主观唯心论。这就是威尔斯从无限混乱的实用主义谎言中所揭示出来的实用主义的本来面目。
    所有以上的诡计，都是在“经验”的概念下进行的。所以，威尔斯着重指出，“经验”一词掩盖了实用主义的许多罪恶，正如列宁所说：“现在各色各样的教授哲学关于‘经验’大吹大擂，借以掩饰它们的反动性。”（“唯物论与经验批判论”）
    威尔斯不但揭露了杜威利用“经验”来“改造”哲学的一切反动性，而且也揭露了他利用“经验”来“改造”社会理论。威尔斯指出，杜威把社会、道德和教育的理论构成一个三段论式：所有的社会问题都是道德问题；所有的道德问题都是教育问题；因此，所有的社会问题都是教育问题。而教育的主要任务在于保持现状，而不是改变现状。因此，杜威的整个论证是保存资本主义的万古长存的统治。
    威尔斯又进一步指出：杜威全部哲学的最高峰在于对于宗教的“改造”。他反对超自然的宗教，但是他认为，世界是不可知的，危险的，不确定的，对于这个反复无常的世界，只有“服从和尊敬”；人底行为“是在侵入未为人所知的领域”，“好东西是靠天恩、并不是由我们自己得来的”。在这个世界中“可见的东西安排在不可见的东西中间；归根到底，那看不见的决定着在看得见的东西中间发生的事情。”人类如“坐在同一只船上、横渡着同一个汹涌澎湃的海洋。这个事实底潜在的宗教的意义是无限的”。杜威就这样使宗教渗透在一切生活领域，就这样使人倒退到蒙昧无知的境地，而永久受奴役。建立这种宗教是杜威整个哲学的主要目标，是它的核心，是它的最高峰。这种宗教是为资产阶级所需要的，在帝国主义时代尤为需要。杜威的确是美国帝国主义的最高的辩护士，是伪装起来的神学贩子。
    因此，威尔斯指出：实用主义不仅是一种方法，而且是一种理论。实用主义者硬说实用主义仅仅是一种方法，不是一种理论，那是掩盖它的本来面目的一种手法。依照实用主义的理论，反动学者可以从反动利益出发，在经济、社会、政治、心理和科学等方面作出任何捏造，而使它们合理化。
    威尔斯在本书的最后一章“帝国主义底哲学”中，总结了全书的分析，给实用主义的特性作了如下的表述：
    “实用主义是帝国主义时代美国资本主义底主要的哲学。它是故步自封的资产阶级底唯心主义世界观。它兼有方法和理论。实用主义的方法是纯粹经验主义的，依靠随机应变的、方便性的和机会主义的手段以达到目的。实用主义的理论是属于实证主义类型的主观唯心主义。它对生活采取主观主义、蒙昧主义、虚构捏造的观点。总之，实用主义是一种为残忍、愚昧和迷信作辩护的阶级武器。在方法和理论上它与辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义对立，旨在反对为解放而斗争的工人阶级及其同盟者。”
    实用主义是美国垄断资产阶级的世界观，同时又是这个阶级反对工人运动的精神武器。威尔斯说：“没有一个社会成员，包括工人在内，能够避免为实用主义的腐蚀性影响所波及。它通过无限的各种各样的孔道钻入他底意识中。它通过无线电、报纸、孩子底教育而侵入他底家庭。它通过引人入歧途的工会领导人和被雇用的特务而渗入他底工会。”
    这是因为，实用主义取消知识和理论，使实践成为没有科学理论指导的盲目行动。它使工人把实践活动和革命理论分开，脱离长远的理论指导，使工人运动变成经济主义和工联主义，束缚在资本主义制度之内，而不能超出它的范围。它帮助工人贵族把工会政策和华尔街老板们的内外政策和纲领结合起来，出卖工人阶级。正因为如此，实用主义首先是帝国主义的哲学，同时也是美国社会民主派（帝国主义者在工人阶级中的代理人）的理论基础，而杜威首先是帝国主义最重要的哲学家，同时也是美国社会民主派的最重要的哲学家。
    威尔斯在总结实用主义的社会作用时指出：实用主义的反理性的原则和方便主义，确实反映了垄断资本家的阶级特性。这个阶级只能依据方便行事，无论在目标上或达到目标的手段上，都不能依据客观规律，而只能依据自己的意志和愿望。帝国主义的内外政策不是以科学知识为基础，而是以达到目的不择手段的方便为基础，以实用主义为基础。没有原则，只有方便，这是实用主义的特性和任务。这种特性和任务就直接为战争政策、实力政策、法西斯主义开辟了道路。法西斯头子墨索里尼曾经赞扬詹姆士为他的“老师”，他说：“詹姆士底实用主义在我底政治生涯中有很大的用处。詹姆士指教我：一个行动应当由它的结果来判断，而不是由它底学说的基础来判断。我从詹姆士学得了对行动的信心，对生活和奋斗的强烈的意志，法西斯主义底大部分成功都靠这些。我认为最主要的就是行动。”（本书一五四页）所以，威尔斯深恶痛绝地斥责了实用主义。他说：“它（实用主义——作者）是一种尼采式的超人哲学，没有善恶，没有真理与错误，没有人性。它是走向死亡绝路的阶级底走向死亡绝路的哲学。”（本书二四七页）他指出了实用主义不但是马克思主义的最凶狠的敌人，而且是全世界和平民主和进步人类最阴险和最邪恶的敌人。
    本书对实用主义的批判是尖锐而彻底的，同时，这种批判又是依靠细致的分析和严密的论证来进行的，所以，它就具有很强的说服力。作者对实用主义哲学的代表人物，不是简单地摘引他们的几句话来加以斥骂，而是对他们的论点，对他们的理论系统进行了科学的辩论，从而把他们驳得体无完肤。因此，这本书贯彻了党性的原则，而这种党性原则是和科学的态度不可分的。其次，作者十分注意实用主义哲学和现实政治的关系，在批判中贯彻了理论联系实际的方法。这是本书的很突出的两个优点。到目前为止，在我们看到的批判实用主义的著作中，这还是最有系统、最深入的一本。中国的马克思主义者和美国的马克思主义者是在一条战线上的，在共同的反对实用主义的斗争中，中国的读者将怀着很大的兴趣来阅读我们的美国战友的这本著作。
