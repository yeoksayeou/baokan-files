    Comrade Zhang Wentian's Speech at the Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in the Capital

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Comrade Zhang Wentian, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, delivered a speech at the celebration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia in the capital. The full text is as follows:

    Dear Ambassador Comrade, Comrades, Friends!

    Ten years ago, in November 1945, the liberated Yugoslav people held universal and democratic elections for representatives to the Constituent Assembly throughout the country. On November 29th, the Constituent Assembly announced the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and issued a declaration completely abolishing the monarchy. The new Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia was born. Today, we are holding a grand gathering here to celebrate this glorious festival. On behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, please allow me to extend my heartfelt congratulations and highest respect to the Yugoslav people and the Government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia.

    The history of Yugoslavia is the history of the long-term struggle of the Yugoslav people for national independence. The Yugoslav people have a tradition of loving freedom, especially manifested in the years of struggle against fascist tyranny. As everyone knows, in April 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded by fascist Germany and Italy. However, the Yugoslav people did not succumb to the occupiers. They responded to the call of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and, under the leadership of the Communist Party, bravely fought against the fascist enslavers. During these difficult years of battle, the heroic Yugoslav people and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia underwent severe tests, waged a great struggle, launched years of guerrilla warfare, contained, resisted, and annihilated a large number of armed forces of German and Italian fascists, liberated a considerable amount of territory, and established local people's organs of power. The Yugoslav people suffered enormous sacrifices in the struggle to win the liberation of their country and to establish the people's regime. However, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia headed by Comrade Tito, and with the support of the Soviet Union and the people of the world in the anti-fascist struggle, this heroic struggle finally achieved victory. The Soviet army annihilated the Hitler bandit army on the Soviet-German front and entered Yugoslav territory. The Soviet army and the Yugoslav People's Liberation Army fought side by side, jointly gave the enemy a devastating blow near Belgrade, and completed the liberation of Eastern Serbia, Vojvodina, and the Yugoslav capital Belgrade. Soon after, the entire Yugoslavia was liberated. On the liberated land, the Yugoslav people established their own Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia and began to restore the national economy destroyed by the war and build a new life. Although the fascist occupiers caused significant damage to Yugoslavia's economy, especially its industry, and although Yugoslavia was previously a country dominated by agriculture, the Yugoslav working class and working people, with a glorious tradition of combat, revolution, and patriotism, finally overcame all kinds of difficulties on the road ahead with selfless labor and amazing perseverance. After the war, Yugoslavia implemented public ownership of the means of production in the industrial and transportation sectors. The state controls the banking, credit system, and wholesale commerce. In industry and commerce, private economic components (handicraft production and small businesses) account for only 10 percent. The industrialization policy implemented by the people's government has achieved remarkable success. In the past ten years, Yugoslavia has newly established many industrial sectors that did not exist before. About 250 new enterprises have been built and put into production. Yugoslavia's industrial production in 1954 reached 208 percent of the pre-war level. Industry has become the most important source of national income for the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The proportion of the industrial sector in the national income is now 42.1 percent. The proportion of the production of means of production in the total industrial production is increasing year by year, and now accounts for more than two-thirds. The number of workers working in industry, transportation, and construction has increased from 300,000 in 1939 to 1,275,000 in 1954. All of this powerfully proves that Yugoslavia is transforming from a backward agricultural country to an advanced socialist industrial country.

    In terms of agricultural production, as a result of the land reform implemented after the war, the system of private ownership of large amounts of land has been abolished. Of the 1.5 million hectares of land confiscated from landlords, 800,000 hectares have been distributed to farmers, and the rest has been transferred to the state. In the initial years after the war, many production cooperatives were established in the Yugoslav countryside. According to materials from May 1955, Yugoslavia now has 875 agricultural production cooperatives and 7,000 production and marketing cooperatives.

    We are very pleased to see that with the development of Yugoslavia's national economy, the material life of the Yugoslav people has improved. In terms of cultural life, the situation is also completely different from before the war: Between 1938 and 1939, Yugoslavia had only three universities and 29 colleges, higher education institutions, and academies of sciences, with 17,700 students. By the 1953-1954 academic year, there were already five universities, 72 colleges, higher education institutions, and academies of sciences, with a total of 75,543 students. Today, Yugoslavia has 18 daily newspapers, 144 weekly newspapers, 197 semi-monthly and monthly magazines, as well as 94 semi-annuals, annuals, and yearbooks, and 18 radio stations. In literature and art, there have also been significant achievements. In the past ten years, Yugoslav writers and poets have written 1,280 works, a total of nearly 150 novels, and more than 300 collections of novellas and short stories, most of which are artistically more valuable than pre-war works. The above facts are sufficient to show that the young Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia has made great progress in the people's cultural life.

    The normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the rapid development towards comprehensive friendly cooperation, is not only in the interests of the people of both countries, but also of great significance for the cause of peace and socialism. Precisely for this reason, all peace-loving countries and people in the world attach great importance to the talks between the government delegations of the Soviet Union and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia from the end of May to the beginning of June this year. The declaration issued by the government representatives of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia after the talks is a document of great international significance and makes a huge contribution to easing international tensions and consolidating world peace. Since the governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have reached a common agreement on all important issues related to the international situation and Soviet-Yugoslav relations, they have laid a solid and sound foundation for expanding and consolidating the fraternal friendship of the people of both countries. Now the governments and peoples of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are firmly following the path pointed out by the Soviet-Yugoslav declaration in their bilateral relations and international cooperation. At the same time, with the improvement of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, the development of friendly relations between all People's Democratic countries and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia has also been promoted. All of these have a profound impact on easing international tensions and consolidating peace in Europe and the world. We, the Chinese people, like all peace-loving people in the world and those who are genuinely concerned about the cause of socialism and the international workers' movement, wholeheartedly welcome the development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations, believing that this is in the true interests of the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, hundreds of millions of peace-loving people around the world, and the international working class. We are convinced that the friendly cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries will increase day by day, because the people of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and all People's Democratic countries have the same ideals in the struggle for human peace, prosperity, and happiness, have the common need to fight for strengthening world peace, and have a common fundamental interest—the interest of the international workers' movement. We congratulate the increasingly consolidated fraternal friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia! We congratulate the increasingly developed friendly cooperation between Yugoslavia and all peace-loving countries and people around the world.

    Although China and Yugoslavia are geographically far apart, the people of our two countries have long fought for independence and freedom, the people of our two countries are striving to build their own new socialist life, and the people of our two countries have the same will to safeguard world peace and cooperation between the people of all countries. This has created a sincere desire for friendly cooperation between the people of our two countries. The Chinese people have always deeply admired the Yugoslav people's struggle for independence and freedom, especially the heroic and unyielding struggle waged in the anti-fascist war. The Chinese people have also always held sincere respect for the Yugoslav people's spirit of not fearing difficulties and forging ahead in developing their national economy. The Chinese people know deeply that the Yugoslav people love peace and have made unremitting efforts to strive for peace. The Chinese people read with great interest the brilliant stories of the Yugoslav people in resisting fascist aggression and building a socialist motherland. Now, China and Yugoslavia have established diplomatic relations, and the friendly relations between our two countries are developing in accordance with the interests of the people of both countries and the interests of world peace and the cause of socialism. Yugoslavia's policies of promoting international peaceful coexistence, collective security, and universal disarmament, as well as other policies conducive to easing international tensions, are firmly supported by the Chinese government and the entire people. We are very grateful for Yugoslavia's attitude and support in confirming China's legitimate rights in the United Nations; we are also very grateful for its view that China should exercise sovereignty over Taiwan. Our two countries are working together to ease international tensions, implement peaceful coexistence between countries, and strengthen economic cooperation and cultural exchanges between countries. The trade relations and cultural exchanges between our two countries are developing. The mutual visits and performances of the Yugoslav "Kolo" folk song and dance troupe and the Chinese art troupe have made great contributions to the development of friendly cooperation between the Chinese and Yugoslav people, especially cultural ties. Prior to this, trade union delegations from China and Yugoslavia had exchanged visits. Recently, trade delegations and journalist delegations from our country have also visited Yugoslavia. The exchanges and contacts between the people of China and Yugoslavia have become increasingly frequent and will continue to develop in the future. There is no doubt that this economic exchange and cultural exchange work will further strengthen the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Yugoslavia. And this fraternal friendship with common ideals and goals will make a great contribution to the cause of world peace. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, I once again express my sincere congratulations and respect to the heroic Yugoslav people and the Yugoslav government headed by Comrade Tito.

    Long live the friendly cooperation between the people of China and Yugoslavia!
    Long live the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia!
    Long live peace!

    在首都庆祝南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年大会上
    张闻天同志的讲话
    新华社讯　中共中央政治局委员、中华人民共和国外交部副部长张闻天在首都各界人民庆祝南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年大会上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的大使同志，同志们，朋友们！
    十年以前，一九四五年十一月，解放了的南斯拉夫人民在全国进行了立宪会议代表的普遍的、民主的选举。十一月二十九日，立宪会议宣布了南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国的成立和发表了彻底废除君主政体的宣言。新的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国诞生了。今天，我们在这里举行隆重的集会，庆祝这个光辉的节日。请允许我以中国人民和中华人民共和国政府的名义，向南斯拉夫人民和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府表示衷心的祝贺和崇高的敬意。
    南斯拉夫的历史，也就是南斯拉夫各族人民为民族独立而长期斗争的历史。南斯拉夫人民有爱好自由的传统，特别表现在为反对法西斯暴政而进行斗争的年代中。大家知道，一九四一年四月，南斯拉夫遭受了法西斯德国和意大利的侵略，但是，南斯拉夫各族人民并没有向占领者屈服。他们响应了南斯拉夫共产党的号召，并且在共产党的领导下，英勇地进行了反对法西斯奴役者的斗争。在这些艰难的战斗岁月里，英勇的南斯拉夫人民和南斯拉夫共产党经历了严重的考验，进行了伟大的斗争，展开了多年的游击战争，牵制、抗击和消灭了德、意法西斯的大量武装部队，并且解放了不少国土，建立了地方的人民权力机关。南斯拉夫人民在争取自己国家的解放和争取确立人民政权的斗争中，遭受了巨大的牺牲。可是，在以铁托同志为首的南斯拉夫共产党的领导下，在苏联和全世界人民反法西斯斗争的支援下，这个英勇的斗争终于取得了胜利。苏联军队在苏德战线上歼灭了希特勒匪军并进入南斯拉夫境内，苏联军队和南斯拉夫人民解放军并肩作战，在贝尔格莱德附近共同给了敌人以毁灭性的打击，完成了东塞尔维亚、伏伊伏丁那和南斯拉夫首都贝尔格莱德的解放；随着不久，南斯拉夫全国都解放了。南斯拉夫各族人民，在解放了的土地上，建立了自己的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国，并且着手恢复被战争破坏的国民经济，建设新的生活。尽管法西斯占领者使南斯拉夫的经济，特别是工业，遭受了重大损失，尽管南斯拉夫过去是一个以农业为主的国家，具有战斗的、革命的和爱国的光荣传统的南斯拉夫工人阶级和劳动人民，终于用忘我的劳动和惊人的毅力，克服了前进路途上的种种困难。战后，南斯拉夫已在工业和运输部门中，实行了生产资料的公有制。国家手中控制了银行、信贷系统和批发商业。在工商业中，私人经济成份（手工业生产和小商业）只占百分之十。人民政权实行的工业化政策取得了显著的成就。十年来，南斯拉夫新建立了许多以前没有的工业部门，约有二百五十个新的企业已经建成和开工生产。南斯拉夫的工业生产在一九五四年已经达到战前水平的百分之二百零八。工业已经成为南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国国民收入的最重要的来源。现在工业部分在全国国民收入中所占比重是百分之四十二点一。而生产资料的生产在全部工业生产总额中的比重又是一年一年地增加着，现在已占到三分之二以上。在工业、运输业和建筑业中工作的工人数量，已从一九三九年的三十万人增加到一九五四年的一百二十七万五千人。所有这一切，都有力地证明了南斯拉夫正在从落后的农业国转向先进的社会主义工业国。
    在农业生产方面，由于战后实行土地改革的结果，私人拥有大量土地的所有制已被废除了。从地主手中没收过来的一百五十万公顷的土地，其中八十万公顷已经分配给农民，其余转到国家手中。在战后的最初几年中，南斯拉夫农村中建立了许多生产合作社。根据一九五五年五月的材料，南斯拉夫现在有八百七十五个农业生产合作社以及七千个产销合作社。
    我们很愉快地看到，随着南斯拉夫国民经济的发展，南斯拉夫人民的物质生活已经有了改善。在文化生活方面，情况也和战前完全不同了：在一九三八—一九三九年间，南斯拉夫只有三所大学和二十九个学院、高等学校和科学院，学生一万七千七百人。到一九五三—一九五四年度，已经有了五所大学，七十二个学院、高等学校、科学院，共有学生七万五千五百四十三人。今天，南斯拉夫有十八种日报，一百四十四种周报，一百九十七种半月刊和月刊，还有九十四种半年刊、年刊和年鉴以及十八个广播电台。在文学艺术方面，也有了显著的成就，十年以来，南斯拉夫作家和诗人所写的作品有一千二百八十种，一共出版了近一百五十部长篇小说，三百多部中篇和短篇小说集，其中大部分作品的艺术价值远远超过了战前作品的水平。上述这些事实足以说明，年青的南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国在人民文化生活方面已经有了很大的高涨。
    南斯拉夫和苏联两国关系的正常化，和向全面友好合作方向的迅速发展，不但符合于两国人民的利益，而且对于和平和社会主义事业具有重大的意义。正因为如此，全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民，极其重视今年五月底至六月初苏联和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国两国政府代表团之间的会谈。苏南两国政府代表在会谈后发表的宣言，乃是一个具有重要国际意义的文件，并且对于缓和国际紧张局势和巩固世界和平的事业有巨大的贡献。苏联政府和南斯拉夫政府既然在有关国际局势和苏南关系的一切重要问题上达成了共同协议，也就为扩大和巩固两国的兄弟般的人民的友谊奠定了坚定的和健全的基础。现在苏南两国政府和人民在两国关系上和国际合作方面，正在坚定地遵循着苏南宣言所指出的道路向前迈进。同时，随着苏南关系的改善，也推进了所有人民民主国家同南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国之间的友好关系的发展。所有这些，都对缓和国际紧张局势、巩固欧洲和世界的和平发生深远的影响。我们中国人民，同全世界爱好和平以及真正关心社会主义事业和国际工人运动的人们一样，衷心地欢迎苏南两国关系的发展，认为这是符合于苏南两国人民、全世界亿万爱好和平人民以及国际工人阶级的真正利益的。我们深信，南斯拉夫同苏联和人民民主国家之间的友好合作，必能日益增进，因为苏联、南斯拉夫和所有人民民主国家人民在争取人类和平、繁荣和幸福的斗争中有着一致的理想，有着为加强世界和平而斗争的共同需要，有着共同的根本的利益——国际工人运动的利益。我们祝贺苏联同南斯拉夫两国人民之间的兄弟友谊和合作日益巩固！我们祝贺南斯拉夫同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民之间的友好合作日益发展。
    中国和南斯拉夫虽然在地理上相隔很远，但是我们两国人民都长期进行过争取独立、自由的斗争，我们两国人民都在为建设自己的社会主义新生活而奋斗，我们两国人民都有着维护世界和平和各国人民之间合作的相同意志，这就使我们两国人民产生了友好合作的真挚的愿望。中国人民对于南斯拉夫人民争取独立、自由的斗争，特别是在反法西斯战争中所进行的英勇不屈的斗争，一向是深为敬佩的。中国人民对于南斯拉夫人民在发展自己国民经济中的那种不怕困难的、勇往直前的精神，也一直怀着由衷的敬意。中国人民深知南斯拉夫人民热爱和平，并且为争取和平进行了不断的努力。中国人民以极大的兴趣阅读着南斯拉夫人民在反抗法西斯侵略和建设社会主义祖国过程中的辉煌故事。现在，中南两国已经建立了外交关系，我们两国的友好关系，正按照两国人民的利益，世界和平和社会主义事业的利益向前发展。南斯拉夫的促进国际和平共处、集体安全和普遍裁军的政策，以及其他有利于缓和国际紧张局势的政策，都受到中国政府和全体人民的坚决支持。我们对于南斯拉夫在确认中国在联合国的正当权利方面所持的态度和给予的支持，是非常感激的；对于它认为中国应当行使对台湾的主权的观点，也是非常感激的。我们两国正在共同为缓和国际紧张局势、实行各国之间的和平共处、加强各国之间的经济合作和文化交流而努力。我们两国之间的贸易关系和文化交流正在向前发展。南斯拉夫“科罗”民间歌舞团和中国艺术团的相互访问和演出，对于发展中南两国人民的友好合作，特别是文化上的联系有很大的贡献。在这以前，中南两国的工会代表团曾进行了相互的访问。最近我国的贸易代表团和记者代表团等又到了南斯拉夫。中南两国人民间的来往和联系已日益频繁，而且今后还会更加发展。毫无疑问，这种经济来往和文化交流工作一定会进一步加强中南两国人民之间的友好合作。而这种具有共同理想和目标的兄弟友谊，必将对世界和平事业作出巨大的贡献。值此南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国建国十周年之际，我在这里再一次向英勇的南斯拉夫人民和以铁托同志为首的南斯拉夫政府表示真挚的祝贺和敬意。
    中南两国人民的友好合作万岁！
    南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国万岁！
    和平万岁！
