　　Accelerate the Construction of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant
　　Ma Jie, Third Deputy Director of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant
    Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the issue of agricultural cooperation have greatly inspired the enthusiasm of the workers and staff in the construction of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant. We are determined to use our greatest efforts to accelerate the construction of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, so as to provide modern technical conditions for the further development of agricultural cooperation in our country as soon as possible.
    In the past two years or so, the main work of the Tractor Manufacturing Plant has been to select a factory site in accordance with the principles of planned development of the national economy and the rational distribution of productive forces of enterprises, and based on the economic and technical indicators necessary for the construction of a new plant; to survey the foundation, collect, sort out, and compile various basic design materials; to carry out the division of labor, commissioning, organization, and management of various designs; and to prepare for construction in terms of organization and materials. This work is very complex and difficult. There is neither water nor electricity, and transportation is not very convenient. More seriously, there is a particular lack of information needed for such a large-scale industrial construction unit. For example, in order to make the factory's design technically reasonable, advanced, and economical, the wind direction alone requires materials such as the frequency of wind over the past ten years and the annual temperature and rainfall, which require years of recording and accumulation to obtain. To this end, we had to travel to more than eighty cities, more than three thousand institutions, and more than one hundred villages for investigation in nearly a year. At the same time, the vast majority of us who are engaged in specific work are "new recruits" who have just moved from the countryside to the industrial construction front and lack the technology and experience necessary for industrial construction. Under such circumstances, the difficulties encountered in the work can be imagined. However, under the leadership of the Party and the government and with the help of Soviet experts, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of workers, staff, and engineering and technical personnel, this work has been completed. The preliminary design, technical design, and drawings required for the factory buildings this year were handed over to the construction unit before construction began. Workers' dormitories, water sources, railway lines, etc., required for factory construction have been built. Auxiliary enterprises required for construction, such as wood processing plants, precast concrete component plants, foam cement plants, concrete mixing plants, and metal structure processing plants, have also been put into production. In this way, on National Day this year, the main factory building project of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant started construction.
    At present, the foundation engineering of the factory buildings of the foundry workshop, auxiliary workshop, forging workshop, and main warehouse has been completed. On the construction site, which accounts for one-tenth of the factory area, covering tens of thousands of square meters, the magnificent outline of the foundation of some factory buildings has emerged.
    Of course, due to some shortcomings in the construction plan and organization work, only 69.54 percent of the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant's total basic construction plan for this year was completed in the first three quarters, and the remaining more than 30 percent must be completed in the fourth quarter. In order to complete this arduous task, we have mobilized all workers, staff, and engineering and technical personnel. From the current situation, it is entirely possible to strive to fully complete the annual plan. Because we have repeatedly consulted and adjusted the plan requirements for each specific project with the construction unit and finalized them, the main drawings and technical materials required for construction have been prepared, the main building materials have also been stored, the construction conditions are also ready, the potential of the construction unit is still great, and the confidence is high. At the same time, according to the suggestions of Soviet experts, it was decided to adopt the comprehensive hoisting method to accelerate the construction progress of the factory building, changing the past method of hoisting columns, connecting beams, metal roof trusses, purlins, and roof panels multiple times to overall installation in parallel three-dimensional operations at one time. In this way, the utilization rate of machinery can be greatly improved, costs can be saved, and the two workshops that could only complete part of the column project in the past can complete the large roof engineering in the same planning period. In addition, according to the design conditions and construction needs, some railway, pipeline, and road projects in the factory that were planned to be constructed next year can also be started in advance this year. As long as we further strengthen planning and organizational work, comprehensively plan, focus on key points, strengthen cooperation more closely, and solve problems on the construction site in a timely manner, we will be able to fulfill this year's construction plan satisfactorily. In terms of comprehensive conservation work, we have launched a mass anti-waste campaign, exposing and criticizing the serious waste caused by the erroneous thinking of "blindly large-scale, everything modern" and violating the normal procedures of capital construction in the past, and have taken resolute measures to reduce non-productive construction standards and reduce the expenditure standards of various expenses. In the planned investment this year alone, we can save the country 5.03 million yuan, of which 1.01 million yuan is saved in various expenses. However, there are still many shortcomings. This is mainly because ideological mobilization is not deep and thorough enough, failing to raise the understanding of comprehensive conservation work to the basic policy of national industrial construction. The conservation measures are not comprehensive and practical enough. On the one hand, we oppose waste, and on the other hand, there is still waste. For example, the construction cost of the temporary station building of the railway marshalling station in the factory area, although reduced from 42 yuan per square meter to 27 yuan, is not suitable for winter due to poor design, and it needs to be repaired only half a year after it was built. This shows that our understanding and implementation of the Party and the state's policies are not comprehensive enough. We must continue to carry out an in-depth and sustained campaign to increase production and practice economy, strengthen the review and management of design budget quotas, strictly implement the system of acceptance and payment by ten-day periods and monthly settlement, conscientiously verify the quantity and quality of projects, strengthen financial supervision, strictly implement financial plans, promptly dispose of accumulated materials, regularly clean up materials, and carry out mass supervision of conservation, so as to ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the annual conservation targets.
    We deeply know the position occupied by the tractor manufacturing plant in the socialist transformation of our country's agriculture, and we also know how glorious and arduous the tasks we shoulder are. We must redouble our efforts, accelerate construction in accordance with the principles of "good, fast, economical, and safe," and strive to put it into production ahead of schedule.

　　加速建设第一拖拉机制造厂
　　第一拖拉机制造厂第三副厂长　马捷
    毛泽东主席关于农业合作化问题的指示和中共中央七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，大大鼓舞了建设第一拖拉机制造厂的职工们的劳动热情。我们决心用最大的努力，加速建设第一拖拉机制造厂，以便早日为我国农业合作化的进一步发展提供现代的技术条件。
    在过去两年多的时间中，拖拉机制造厂的主要工作，就是按照国民经济有计划的发展、企业生产力合理分布的原则，和根据新厂建设所必需的经济技术指标来选择厂址；勘察地基，收集、整理、编纂各种基本设计资料；进行各项设计的分工委托和组织管理工作；以及做好施工前组织和材料等各方面的准备工作。这些工作是很复杂、很困难的。在当地，既无水、又缺电，交通也不很方便。更严重的是，为进行这样一个大规模的工业建设单位所需的资料又特别缺乏。例如，为了使工厂的设计在技术上又合理又先进又经济，只风向一项就需要已往十年风的频率和历年气温、雨量等材料，这些都需要常年记录和积累才能得到。为此，我们曾不得不在将近一年的时间内走了八十多个城市的三千多个机关和一百多个村庄进行调查。同时，我们从事具体工作的人，绝大多数是刚刚从农村转到工业建设战线上的“新兵”，缺乏工业建设所必需的技术和经验。在这样的情况下，工作中所遇到的困难是可想而知的。但是，在党和政府的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，由于广大职工和工程技术人员的努力，这些工作都完成了。工厂的初步设计、技术设计和今年开工厂房所需要的图纸，都在开工前交给了施工单位。为工厂建设所需的职工宿舍、水源、铁路用线等，都建成了。施工所需的附属企业如木材加工厂、混凝土预制构件厂、泡沫水泥厂、混凝土搅拌厂、金属结构加工厂等，也已经分别投入了生产。这样，在今年国庆节的那天，第一拖拉机制造厂的主厂房工程开工了。
    现在，修铸工场、辅助工场、锻工场和总库房的厂房基础工程已经完工。在占厂区面积十分之一的几万平方公尺的施工现场上，已经显出部分厂房基础的雄伟的轮廓。
    当然，由于施工计划和组织工作方面的一些缺点，拖拉机制造厂今年全部的基本建设计划在前三季度中只完成百分之六十九点五四，剩余的百分之三十以上，必须在第四季度来完成。为了完成这一繁重的任务，我们已经对全体职工和工程技术人员作了动员工作。就目前的情况来看，争取全面完成年度计划，是完全可以做到的。因为我们已就各个具体工程项目的计划要求同施工单位反复协商调整定案，施工所需的主要图纸和技术资料已经备齐，主要建筑材料也已经贮备，施工条件也准备就绪，施工单位的潜力还很大，信心也高。同时，根据苏联专家的建议，决定采取综合装吊的方法来加速厂房施工进度，把过去多次装吊柱子、连接梁、金属屋架、檩条、屋面板方法，改为立体平行作业一次进行总体安装。这样，可以大大提高机械利用率，节省费用，使原来只能完成部分立柱工程的两个工场在同样的计划期内完成大部屋面工程。另外根据设计条件和施工需要，有些拟在明年才施工的厂内铁路、管道、道路工程，也可以争取提前在今年开始。只要我们进一步加强计划工作和组织工作，全面统筹、重点掌握，更紧密地加强协作配合，及时解决施工现场的问题，我们就有可能完满实现今年的施工计划。在全面节约工作方面，我们已经开展了群众性的反对浪费大检查，揭发批判了过去工作中由于“盲目大规模，一切近代化”的错误思想和违犯基本建设正常程序所造成的严重浪费现象，并且采取坚决的措施，来降低非生产性的建筑标准，降低各项费用的开支标准，仅在今年计划投资中即可为国家节约五百零三万元，其中，各项费用的开支节约了一百零一万元。但是，还有许多缺点，这主要是思想发动不深不透，未能提高到国家工业建设的基本方针上来认识全面节约的工作，节约措施不全面不切实，一方面反对浪费，一方面还有浪费。如厂区铁路编组站临时站房建筑造价，虽然由每平方公尺四十二元降为二十七元，但是，由于设计不周，在冬天不适用，刚建成不过半年，就要修补。这都说明我们对党和国家的方针的理解和执行是不够全面的。我们还要继续开展深入持久的增产节约运动，加强对设计预算定额的审查和管理，严格执行分旬验收付款、分月结算的制度，切实核实工程数量质量，加强财务监督，严格执行财务计划，及时处理积压材料，定期清理物资，开展群众性的节约监督，把厉行节约的精神贯注到每个环节中去，保证完成和超额完成年度的节约指标。
    我们深知拖拉机制造厂在我国农业的社会主义改造中所占的地位，我们也知道自己所担负的任务是多么光荣而又艰巨。我们一定加倍努力，按照“好、快、省、安全”的原则，加速建设，争取提前投入生产。
