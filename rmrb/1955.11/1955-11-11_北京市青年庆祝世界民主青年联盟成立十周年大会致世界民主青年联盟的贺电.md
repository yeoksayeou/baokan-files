Telegram from the Beijing Youth Celebration of the Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the World Federation of Democratic Youth to the World Federation of Democratic Youth

To the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth:
    We, the young men and women of Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, are gathered here today with excitement to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the founding of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. We would like to extend our warm congratulations to you on behalf of the youth of Beijing.
    Over the past ten years, the World Federation of Democratic Youth has united millions of young people from all countries to fight for lasting peace, democracy, national independence, and a bright future for young people. The various activities organized by the World Federation of Democratic Youth, which are in line with the aspirations of young people, have been increasingly supported by young people from all countries, and its ranks have grown, becoming an important force for young people around the world in defending peace and fighting for the rights of young people. The Fifth World Youth and Student Peace and Friendship Festival held in Warsaw this summer was a vivid review of this force.
    We, the youth of Beijing, like the youth of the whole country, are devoting ourselves to the great cause of peaceful construction of the motherland. We warmly support the various activities of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and will work together with young people from all countries to promote peace and strengthen friendly cooperation among young people from all countries. We are deeply convinced that the World Federation of Democratic Youth will achieve even greater success in its future work for world peace and the interests of the younger generation.

    我们、中华人民共和国首都北京市的青年男女，今天以兴奋的心情集会庆祝世界民主青年联盟成立十周年。我们谨以北京市青年的名义向你们致以热烈的祝贺。
    十年来世界民主青年联盟团结各国千百万青年为争取持久和平、民主、民族独立和青年的美好将来而斗争。世界民主青年联盟所组织的各种符合青年愿望的活动日益受到各国青年的支持，它的队伍也日益壮大，成为世界青年保卫和平、争取青年权利的一支重要力量。今年夏天在华沙举行的第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节就是这种力量的一次生动的检阅。
    我们北京市青年，和全国青年一样，正致力于祖国的巨大的和平建设事业。我们热烈支持世界民主青年联盟的各项活动并将同各国青年一道，为促进和平和加强各国青年间的友好合作而努力。我们深信，世界民主青年联盟今后在为世界和平和青年一代的利益而进行的工作中，必将获得更大的成就。
