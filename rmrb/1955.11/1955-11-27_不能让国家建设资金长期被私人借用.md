　　National Construction Funds Must Not Be Lent to Private Individuals for Long Periods
    To the Editor:
    In the Shijiazhuang Coke Factory, some people are constantly borrowing public funds and not repaying them for long periods. According to September's statistics alone, the factory's employees borrowed as much as 3,556 yuan, accounting for 1.21% of the enterprise's working capital.
    Do all the borrowers have actual difficulties? The facts are not so. Just look at the situation of Xu Xilin, the head of the administrative section. His family of eight has a total monthly income of 165 yuan, which should be enough to live on. However, Section Chief Xu has borrowed public funds time and time again, totaling 584 yuan. When it comes time to repay the loan, he cries out that he is "unable to repay" and even uses refusing to pay Party membership dues as proof. Regrettably, at this very moment, a new radio has been added to Section Chief Xu's bedroom. It turns out that the state's construction funds have been turned into pleasant songs and music in Section Chief Xu's home!
    Why doesn't the finance department supervise and correct such unreasonable problems? The problem is that the accounting section, which directly manages the state's finances in the factory, is actually a leading "collective borrower." The section has a total of ten people, and the section chief and staff members borrow public funds every month. By the end of September, the entire section had borrowed more than 650 yuan. Clerk Yang Kuo Jie has savings in the bank, eats well, and dresses extravagantly, but he also borrows public funds on time. When staff member Yang Yufeng got engaged, he held a large banquet in a restaurant. When he got married, the couple (both working in Shijiazhuang) even went to Tianjin to hold the ceremony. And you're lending this kind of person money!
    Then why are the leading staff members of this enterprise turning a blind eye to these phenomena? The root of the problem lies with Peng Jian, the deputy director of administration of the factory, who directly controls the right to approve employee loans. Deputy Director Peng has a monthly income of more than 110 yuan and more than 180 yuan in savings in the bank, but he still borrows public funds because of "financial difficulties." What is the money used for? The purpose is: to prepare funeral clothes for his still-living mother-in-law, to prepare a large "dowry" for his unmarried daughter...
    What the superiors do, the subordinates follow. Since the leading staff and the finance department are like this, it has created a corrupt and wasteful atmosphere. There are many instances of taking advantage of "business trips" to borrow large sums of public funds to visit relatives and friends, travel, buy clothes, and purchase local products.
    No! This kind of situation must not be allowed in the people's enterprises. The superiors of this factory should quickly plug these loopholes and not allow the state's construction funds to continue to be wasted by these "happy" thieves!

### 不能让国家建设资金长期被私人借用

　　不能让国家建设资金长期被私人借用编辑同志：
    在石家庄焦厂，有些人不断借用公款，而且长期不还。光是九月份的统计，这个厂职工借款多达三千五百五十六元，占企业流动资金的百分之一点二一。
    是不是借款的人都有实际困难呢？事实并非如此。看一下行政科长许锡林的情况就知道了。他家大小八口，工资收入每月共一百六十五元，应该说是够吃够用的了。但是许科长却一次又一次地借用公款，前后共借了五百八十四元。到要还款的时候，他就大叫“无力偿还”，甚至用拒绝交党费的办法来作为证明。令人遗憾的是，就在这个时候，许科长的卧室里却新添了一部收音机。原来，国家的建设资金在许科长的家里变成了悦耳的歌声和音乐了！
    这样不合理的问题，为什么财务部门不出来监督、纠正呢？问题就在于，厂里直接掌管国家财务的会计科竟是一个带头“集体借款”的单位。这个科共十个人，科长、科员每人每月都借公款，到九月底全科共借了六百五十多元。办事员杨廓杰银行有存款，吃得讲究，穿得阔绰，但是也按期不误地借用公款。科员杨域峰订婚的时候在饭庄大摆筵席，结婚的时候，夫妇两人（都在石家庄工作）还特地跑到天津去举行仪式，这样的人公家也借给他钱！
    那末为什么这个企业的领导工作人员对这些现象熟视无睹呢？坏根子就产生在这个厂的直接掌握职工借款审批权的行政副厂长彭健身上。彭副厂长每月收入一百一十多元，在银行里有一百八十多元存款，居然也因为“生活困难”而借用公款。借来的钱干什么呢？用途是：为他还健在的岳母准备寿衣，为他未“出阁”的女儿大备“嫁妆”……。
    上行下效，领导人员和财务部门既然这样，就造成了损公肥私和铺张浪费的风气。像乘“出差”之机大借公款来投亲访友、游山玩水和添衣服、采购土产的事情就很多。
    不行！在人民的企业里决不容许有这种情况。这个厂的上级应该赶快堵塞这些漏洞，不让国家的建设资金继续被这些“快乐的”盗窃者糟蹋！
