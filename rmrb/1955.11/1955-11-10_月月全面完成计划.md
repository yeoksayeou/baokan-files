    Complete Plans Comprehensively Every Month
    The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium Plate Mill demonstrated great initiative in the execution of the 1955 annual plan. From January to September, it consistently completed the state plan comprehensively, evenly, and ahead of schedule. The output plan was fulfilled by 115.8%; production costs decreased month by month, and in addition to completing the state-mandated cost reduction plan for the year, costs were further reduced by 565,702 yuan; the quality plan's first-grade product rate was originally set at 88% (a 28% increase compared to the same period last year), but the average reached 94.79% over the nine months; labor productivity increased month by month, cumulatively exceeding the plan by 24.1%; the variety order plan was fulfilled by 100%, supporting more than 800 production and capital construction units with hundreds of types of high-quality steel plates. Currently, all employees of the factory are working hard to complete the various targets for the fourth quarter. These targets are quite advanced. For example, the output plan for December is 11% higher than that of August.
    Comprehensively, evenly, and ahead of schedule completing the 1955 annual plan is the most pressing task for all industrial enterprises at present. All enterprises should, like the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Medium Plate Mill, seize the remaining fifty-plus days before the end of the year and strive to complete and overfulfill the state plan for the year!

    月月全面完成计划
    鞍山钢铁公司中板厂，在执行一九五五年度计划过程中，发挥了很大的积极性。一月到九月，一贯是全面、均衡、超额地完成国家计划。产量计划完成了百分之一百十五点八；生产成本逐月降低，除了已经完成本年度国家规定的降低成本计划以外，又降低了成本五十六万五千七百零二元；质量计划一级品率原规定是百分之八十八（比去年同期提高了百分之二十八），九个月平均达到百分之九十四点七九；劳动生产率逐月上升，累计超过计划百分之二十四点一；品种订货计划完成百分之百，用数百种优质钢板，支援了八百多个生产和基本建设单位。现在，全厂职工，正在为完成第四季度各项指标而努力。这个指标是相当先进的。例如，十二月份的产量计划，即比八月份提高百分之十一。
    全面、均衡、超额完成一九五五年度计划，是一切工业企业目前最迫切的任务。各企业都应该像鞍山钢铁公司中板厂一样，抓紧年前的五十多天时间，为完成和超额完成本年度国家计划而奋斗！
