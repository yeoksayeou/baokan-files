Zhejiang Silk

Our reporters Liu Fan and Zheng Feng

Zhejiang is the "home of silk," with its annual silk production accounting for 30% of the nation's total. Its silk is of excellent quality, comes in many varieties of designs and colors, and is popular with consumers. In addition to meeting domestic demand, large quantities of filature silk, silk fabrics, and silk handicrafts are exported to 26 countries annually. In the past six years, the foreign exchange value of Zhejiang's filature silk exports is equivalent to 400,894.5 tons of steel.

People familiar with silk and satin know that Zhejiang's famous raw silk fabrics include Hangzhou's Hang Luo, Hang Fang, and Hua Xian Chun; Shaoxing's Shao Fang and Shao Hua; Huzhou's Hu Chou and Hua Si Ge; Jiaxing's Hua Juan and Xiao Fang; and Wenzhou's Chou Sha. Finished fabrics made from spun silk include Hangzhou's Rong Yu Duan, Si Yu Duan, Chun Se Duan, San Shan Duan, and Shaoxing's Ning Chou. There are more than 5,000 varieties of designs and colors of finished raw and spun silk fabrics. Embroidered clothing, bed covers, headscarves, curtains, and chair cushions reproduced by Hangzhou, Haimen and other silk and satin manufactures are also sold at home and abroad. In terms of handicrafts, there are the world-famous Hangzhou umbrellas, Hangzhou fans, and brocade woven portraits of great people and landscape paintings. In November 1949, Zhejiang's brocade weaving workers, with tireless labor and superb artistic skills, used more than 50 colors of silk thread to weave a 36-inch high and 24-inch wide three-dimensional Stalin portrait as a gift from the Chinese people to the great revolutionary teacher Stalin on his 70th birthday. This artistic masterpiece has been praised by Soviet friends. Silk landscape paintings record people's favorite West Lake’s "Eighteen Scenic Spots" and Beijing's scenic spots and historical sites such as the "Nine Dragon Wall" and the "Summer Palace" with artistic brushstrokes. Last year, the Hangzhou Public-Private Joint Venture Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory also wove 13,000 colored landscape paintings of "Tiananmen" or "Kremlin" for the people of the whole country as gifts to comfort the People's Liberation Army. The silk umbrella, beloved by people at home and abroad, is only two feet four inches in diameter and is made of colorful light bamboo and silk as thin as clouds. It has twelve different colors of umbrella surfaces, and harmonious landscape patterns are painted on the various bright silk surfaces. Holding this exquisite silk umbrella gives people a feeling of peace and beauty. Distinguished guests who come to Hangzhou, Zhejiang, always bring back some precious silk products and visit the brocade weaving factory. In October last year, more than 600 representatives from 20 countries visited the Hangzhou Public-Private Joint Venture Du Jinsheng Silk Weaving Factory; in November, the Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe and representatives from Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Argentina, and overseas Chinese returning to the country visited the factory. The delegation from the German Democratic Republic also presented their team flag to the silk weaving workers of Hangzhou to express their admiration for the art of Chinese workers. Among international friends, many painters and textile experts hope to exchange silk technology and experience with our country. Soviet friends, after seeing such exquisite Chinese brocade, exclaimed: "Lovely people, magical hands, wonderful works."

Zhejiang silk enriches the colors of the lives of the Chinese people, and it is also an important export commodity for our country's foreign trade. "Two bolts of silk equal one ton of steel" and "One silk umbrella equals sixteen pounds of steel" illustrate that increasing silk production at present is of great significance for supporting the country's socialist industrial construction. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, Zhejiang's silk workers have brought into play a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity and have promoted many new working methods. For example, the vertical reeling method, which has now been promoted throughout the province, can increase the country's raw silk production by more than 800 dan per year. The grade rate of filature silk factories in the province has generally increased from grade D to above grade A, and the grade standards required for export filature silk have been exceeded in the first half of this year. In silk mills, a new silk weaving method of one person watching multiple looms has been implemented. After the Hangzhou Silk Mill, a local state-owned enterprise, implemented this method, labor productivity increased by three times, output per unit time increased by 5.2%, and the rate of substandard products decreased to 3.83%. In 1953, each worker could only operate one loom, but now they can operate six looms. Li Yougen, a worker at the Zhejiang First Silk Weaving Factory and a provincial industrial labor model, has not produced any defective products for five years. After the workers of the Hangzhou Jingrong Dyeing Workshop adopted the Soviet fixing agent and advanced working methods for using the fixing agent based on the suggestions of Soviet dyeing experts, the colors of silk have increased to more than 200, and the fastness of more than a dozen colors has increased from the original level of two or three to level four; after using domestic dyes to dye silk instead of imported dyes, the production cost has been reduced by 30%.

In terms of improving the designs and colors of silk fabrics, the Zhejiang Silk Company organized more than 100 experienced technicians and technical workers in 1953 to form a research group for new varieties and new designs. Now, 23 new varieties such as Shuguang Chou, Heping Juan, Jiankang Ni, Yunxia Duan, Jinxiu Duan, and Yuanyang Chou have been successfully trial-produced, and 266 new designs such as "Peace Dove", "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom", and "Tang and Song Well Algae" that are popular with people have been designed and created with reference to folk art styles. In order to strengthen the testing of new varieties and new designs, the Provincial Silk Company will establish a special sampling factory in the fourth quarter of this year.

There are currently 650,000 peasant households in Zhejiang Province engaged in mulberry cultivation and silkworm rearing. The annual output of silkworm cocoons accounts for 46% of the country's total. During the period of imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary rule, more than half of the province's mulberry gardens were destroyed, and thousands of filature silk and silk weaving factories were destroyed one after another. After liberation, the China Silk Company (now renamed Silk Company) was established in Zhejiang in 1950. The state helped private silk industry solve the problem of insufficient raw materials and funds by means of processing instead of reeling and processing instead of weaving, and helped various filature silk and silk weaving factories open up sales channels in Northeast China, North China, and abroad; the state also supported the silkworm breeding industry, so in recent years, Zhejiang's silk industry has seen a prosperity unprecedented in the past 20 years. In 1953, the output of filature silk from filature silk factories in the province exceeded 80.38% of the highest annual output in history in 1936 before the Anti-Japanese War. At present, the whole province is carrying out a comprehensive movement to increase production and practice economy by opposing inferior products. Through this movement, Zhejiang Province's silk industry will make greater contributions to supporting the country's socialist construction. (Attached picture)

    浙江丝绸
    本报记者　刘凡　正峰
    浙江是“丝绸的故乡”，丝绸的年产量占全国产量百分之三十，质量精美，花色品种多，受到广大消费者的欢迎。这里的丝绸每年除供应国内人民需要外，还有大批的厂丝、绸缎和丝织的工艺品，外销二十六个国家。六年来，浙江厂丝外销价值可换回四十万零八千九百四十三点五吨钢材。
    熟悉丝织、绸缎的人，都知道浙江的著名生丝织品有杭州的杭罗、杭纺、花线春，绍兴的绍纺、绍花，湖州的湖绉、华丝葛，嘉兴的画绢、小纺，温州的绉纱等；熟丝织品有杭州的绒纡缎、丝纡缎、纯色缎、三闪缎和绍兴的寗绸等。生熟丝织的成品，花色和品种总共有五千多种。杭州、海门等地绸缎复制的绣衣、被面、头巾、窗帘、椅垫等也销行国内外。在工艺品方面，有名闻中外的杭伞、杭扇、锦织的伟人像和风景画等。一九四九年十一月，浙江省的锦织工人曾以不倦的劳动和高超的艺术手法，用了五十多种颜色的丝线织了一幅三十六吋高，二十四吋宽五彩立体的斯大林巨像，作为中国人民给伟大的革命导师斯大林七十寿辰的献礼。这幅艺术巨像，曾经受到苏联友人的赞誉。丝织风景画，更以艺术的笔调记录了人们喜爱的西湖十八景，北京的“九龙壁”、“颐和园”等名胜古迹。杭州公私合营都锦生丝织厂去年还为全国人民织了一万三千幅绣着“天安门”或“克里姆林宫”的彩色风景画，作为慰问人民解放军的礼物。为国内外人民所喜爱的绸伞，直径不过二尺四寸，是用彩色的淡竹和薄如云翳的伞绸绷成的，有十二种不同颜色的伞面，在各种鲜艳的绸面上，绘着色彩调和的风景图案。张着这种精巧玲珑的绸伞，给人以一种和平、美丽的感觉。来到浙江杭州的贵宾，总要带回一些名贵的丝织品，也要到锦织工厂去参观。去年十月，就有二十个国家的六百多位代表参观了杭州公私合营都锦生丝织厂；十一月又有苏联国立民间舞蹈团和罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿根廷等国代表以及华侨归国代表团前往参观。民主德国代表团把他们的队旗也送给了杭州市的织锦工人，以表达他们对中国工人艺术的敬慕。在国际友人中，不少画家、纺织专家都希望同我国交流丝绸技术经验。苏联友人看了中国这样精美的锦织品赞叹道：“可爱的人民，奇异的手，绝妙的作品。”
    浙江丝绸丰富了我国人民生活的色彩，同时又是我国对外贸易的重要出口物资。“二匹绸缎一吨钢”，“一把绸伞十六斤钢材”，这说明目前增加丝绸的生产，对支援国家社会主义工业建设有巨大的意义。浙江的丝绸工人，在党和政府的领导下，发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，推行了许多新的工作方法。如现在已在全省推广的立缫工作法，每年就可为国家增加八百多公担生丝。全省缫丝工厂一般生产的品位率，已从D级提高到A级以上，今年上半年已超额完成了外销厂丝所要求的品位标准。在绸厂里，推行了一人看多台织机的新织绸法。地方国营杭州绸厂推行了这个方法后，劳动生产率提高了三倍，台时产量提高了百分之五点二，次货率降低至百分之三点八三。一九五三年，每个工人只能操作一台织机，现在能操作六台织机。浙江第一丝织厂工人、全省工业劳动模范李有根，已经五年不出次品。杭州市经绒染坊的工人们根据苏联印染专家的建议，采用了苏联的固色剂和使用固色剂的先进工作方法以后，丝绸的彩色已增加到二百多种，其中有十多种颜色的牢度，已从原来的二、三级提高到四级；以国产染料代替进口染料染绸后，生产成本降低了百分之三十。
    在改进绸缎花色品种方面，浙江丝绸公司在一九五三年就把一百多名有经验的技术员和技术工人组织起来，成立一个新品种和新花样的研究小组，现在已先后试制成功了曙光绉、荷萍绢、健康呢、云霞缎、锦绣缎、鸳鸯绉等二十三种新品种，并参照了民间艺术风格，设计和创造了大受人们喜爱的如“和平鸽”、“百花齐放”、以及“唐宋井藻”等二百六十六种新花样。省丝绸公司为了加强新品种新花样的试验工作，在今年第四季度将成立一个专门试样厂。
    浙江省现有六十五万户农民培桑育蚕。蚕茧年产量占全国百分之四十六。在帝国主义和国民党反动统治时期，全省有一半以上的桑园被毁，数千家的缫丝和织绸工厂相继被毁。解放后，一九五○年浙江成立了中国蚕丝公司（现改为丝绸公司），国家以加工代缫和加工代织的方式，帮助私营丝绸工业解决原料和资金不足的问题，并且帮助各缫丝、织绸工厂在国内东北、华北和国外打开销路；国家也扶植了养蚕业，因而几年来浙江丝绸工业出现了近二十年来所未有的繁荣景象，一九五三年全省缫丝厂厂丝的产量即已超过抗日战争前一九三六年历史上最高年产量的百分之八十点三八。现在，全省正在开展一个全面的反对次货的增产节约运动，通过这个运动，浙江省的丝绸工业将在支援国家社会主义建设中贡献出更大的力量。（附图片）
