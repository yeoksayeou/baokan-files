　　Moving Songs Across the Pacific
　　— Remembering Black Singer Aubrey Pankey's Concert
　　China Musicians Association Council Member　Xiang Yu
    The music lovers of the capital city greatly enjoyed the concert of the American Black singer Aubrey Pankey. The Czech and Polish famous pieces played by Ms. Marie Knotkova, a professor of the Prague Conservatory of Music in Czechoslovakia, were also programs of interest to the audience.

    It is completely understandable that the American musician who came to New China for the first time was worried about whether his program would be welcomed. But the result of the concert proved that the Chinese people, who love their national culture, will also understand and appreciate all excellent cultural arts of all countries that meet the requirements of human progress. Not to mention that the people of New China have deep sympathy for the Black people who have groaned under the extremely ugly system of racial discrimination for two hundred years! That is why the concert was originally scheduled to be held three times, but had to end with the fifth fully-seated performance.

    Opening the concert program, people can't help but marvel at how rich and broad the singer's repertoire is (this is only a part of the entire repertoire). What particularly interested us was hearing for the first time on stage the novel Black folk songs with a strong local flavor and the songs of various Latin American countries. The people of New China are eager to know how the kind people of all countries, like themselves, use their national musical language to express their yearning for peace and a better life. Mr. Pankey's powerful singing crossed the vast space of the Pacific Ocean, connecting the hearts of the people on both sides more closely.

    Mr. Pankey's each concert begins with earlier classical songs, such as Beethoven's "Adelaide," Handel's "Dear Forest," which is earlier than Beethoven, or Peri's "Orfeo's Lament," an Italian composer between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The singer gradually leads the audience from these rigorous and emotionally deep classical songs to the works of the late nineteenth century, and ends the concert with Black songs that are still circulating among the people. This may be a principle of arranging programs that Mr. Pankey has gradually formed in his hundreds of concerts throughout Europe and Egypt, Palestine, and the United States. This principle helps the audience understand the different styles of songs from various periods. The singer sang for us Handel's instrumental aria from the oratorio, Schubert's and Brahms's exemplary art songs, Strauss's lyrical songs, the passionate romances of Russian composers, and modern works from Argentina, Brazil, and other countries with his broad range, rich timbre changes, and the beautiful voice that is good at expressing the inner emotions of various songs. But the most touching and winning the audience's warmest praise were the Black songs that the singer listed in the last part of the concert.

    People who are more familiar with Western music have also come into contact with Black songs in American movies and song collections, but the former, as Mr. Pankey said, is a distorted and jazzified product of Black game songs (a kind of Black folk song); the latter is also a part that has been selected and has less democracy, and neither can represent the real Black songs. Mr. Pankey's most valuable contribution in art lies in the fact that, as an advanced fighter of his own nation, he serves the Black people's struggle for liberation with high artistic achievements. The singer dissolves his personal experience into artistic images, revealing the tragic life of the Black people and their strong desire for freedom. He truly depicts the tragic life of Black people with deep, tragic tones and painful words. In the song "Legend" written by the singer himself, this accusation against the oppressors reached an extreme of grief and anger: mention John Henry, who opened up this land with an iron shovel; they promised him freedom, just like you and me. But the freedom given to them is ropes and tree trunks. John Henry died with an iron hammer in his hand. Speaking of freedom, it is nothing but a lie. If you go to the South to ask for freedom, it is tantamount to sending yourself to death. They sent him to the battlefield four times, saying:
  "Now you can get freedom—just do as I say." John Henry died with an iron hammer in his hand. But when he returned, the situation was worse than before, and the original job was gone. When he came back, he would think, think, and write, and they would fabricate rumors and slander him, and strangle him in the deep night. John Henry died with an iron hammer in his hand! However, the oppressed people never passively treat their own destiny. In some other Black folk songs full of strength and confidence, such as "Good News," "Going by Chariot," and "Deep River," the singer showed the unconquerable power hidden in the hearts of Black people.

    Black folk songs are often tinged with religious colors. Is this a negative factor in the spirit of folk songs? No. The singer told us: "American Black folk songs (which they themselves call spirituals) are a clever combination of African melodies and biblical stories and the harmony of Christian hymns. Those biblical stories are enough to appeal to the pain and misery under the slavery system, and can also express the slaves' hope and desire for freedom that cannot be expressed publicly. Therefore, these songs have a double meaning. On the one hand, they praise heaven to allude to freedom; on the other hand, they praise the chariot in the Bible to allude to the use of the underground railroad to escape slavery. The story of the children of Israel being enslaved in Egypt in the Bible is a powerful metaphor for the fate of black slaves and their pursuit of freedom."

    However, even from a very small number of certain Black folk songs, we can still see that people desire freedom more than God.

    The simple tone of Black folk songs and the modal melody are approachable. We do not feel strange to it because of geographical distance. The Chinese people, who have been oppressed for a long time, can easily understand Black folk songs, and thus feel very close to Mr. Pankey's performance. The audience at each concert often requested to encore these touching Black folk songs.

    In addition to Professor Knotkova's wonderful solo performances, it must also be mentioned that she has reached a deep understanding of his program in her long-term cooperation with the singer. Therefore, under her hands, music and songs flow out like converging streams, seamlessly merging. Undoubtedly, this is also an important reason for Mr. Pankey's success.

    We hope that after Mr. Pankey, more musicians from the United States will come to New China for visiting performances. Just as the Four-Power Summit pointed out, strengthening cultural exchanges between the East and the West will help develop friendship between the people of all countries, thereby strengthening the common interests of consolidating world peace.

　　跨越太平洋的动人的歌声
　　——记黑人歌唱家奥布雷·潘基的音乐会
　　中国音乐家协会理事　向隅
    首都爱好音乐的人们，以极大的兴趣欣赏了美国黑人歌唱家奥布雷·潘基的音乐会。音乐会中捷克斯洛伐克布拉格音乐学院教授女钢琴家玛丽·克诺特科娃演奏的捷克和波兰名曲，也是听众感到兴趣的节目。
    第一次来新中国作客的美国音乐家，担心他的节目是不是会受到欢迎，这是完全可以理解的。但是音乐会演出的结果，证实了热爱自己民族文化的中国人民，也会理解和欣赏一切国家合乎人类进步要求的优秀文化艺术。更不要说新中国人民，对于二百年来呻吟在极端丑恶的种族歧视制度下的黑人，是怀着多么深厚的同情！这就是为什么音乐会原定举行三次，却不得不以第五个满座的演出作为它的结束。
    打开音乐会的节目单，人们不禁要惊叹歌唱家的保留节目是多么丰富和广博（这还只是全部保留节目的一部分）。特别使我们感到兴趣的是，第一次从舞台上听到了新颖而又有着浓厚乡土气息的黑人民歌和拉丁美洲各国的歌曲。新中国人民渴望知道像自己一样善良的各国人民怎样用本民族的音乐语言，来表达他们对和平、对美好生活的向往。潘基先生强有力的歌声跨越了太平洋上广阔的空间，把两岸人民的心更紧密地连结起来了。
    潘基先生的每一次音乐会，都以较早的古典歌曲开始，如贝多芬的“阿黛莉德”，比贝多芬更早的韩德尔的“亲爱的森林”，或在十六、七世纪之间的意大利作曲家培利的“奥尔菲颂”。歌唱家把听众们从这些格律严谨、感情深厚的古典歌曲逐渐引向十九世纪末叶的作品，以至今在民间流传的黑人歌曲作为音乐会的结束。这可能是潘基先生在他遍历欧洲和埃及、巴勒斯坦，以及美国本土的几百次音乐会中，逐渐形成的一种安排节目的原则。这种原则有助于听众了解各个时期歌曲作品的不同风格。歌唱家以他宽阔的音域，富于音色上的变化和善于表达各种歌曲的内在情绪的美妙声音，为我们演唱了韩德尔神曲中器乐化的咏叹调、舒伯特和勃拉姆斯的堪称典范的艺术歌曲、斯特劳斯的抒情歌、热情洋溢的俄国作曲家的罗曼斯，以及阿根廷、巴西等国的近代作品。而感人最深、赢得听众最热烈的赞赏的，还是歌唱家列在音乐会最后部分的黑人歌曲。
    比较熟悉西方音乐的人也曾在美国电影和歌集中接触过黑人歌曲，但前者正如潘基先生所说的，是黑人游戏歌曲（黑人民歌的一种）被歪曲、被爵士化了的产物；后者也是经过选择、民主性较少的一部分，都不能代表真正的黑人歌曲。潘基先生在艺术上最有价值的贡献，就在于他作为自己民族的先进战士，以高度的艺术成就服务于黑人求解放的斗争。歌唱家把自己亲身的体验溶化为艺术形象，揭示了黑人的悲惨生活和渴望得到自由的强烈愿望。他以深沉的、充满悲剧性的音调和沉痛的词句，真实地描绘着黑人的悲惨生活。在歌唱家本人创作的歌曲“传说”中，这种对压迫者的控诉达到了悲愤的极度：提起约翰·亨利这么一个人，他手执铁锹开垦了这块土地；他们对他许下了自由，正像对你我一般。然而给他们的自由是绳索和树干。约翰·亨利手执铁锤死了，提起自由，那不过是谎骗，你到南方去要求自由，就等于自去送死。他们四次送他上战场，这样说：
  “现在你可以得到自由了——只要照着我的话去做。”约翰·亨利手执铁锤死了。可是当他归来，光景更不如前，原有的活儿再也不见，当他归来，他会想，会念，会写，他们便造谣诬告，把他绞杀在深夜里。约翰·亨利手执铁锤死了！然而受压迫的人民从来不消极地对待自己的命运。在另一些充满力量和信心的黑人民歌“好信息”、“乘兵车前去”、“深深的河”等中，歌唱家显示了潜藏在黑人心中的不可征服的力量。
    黑人民歌往往蒙上了宗教的色彩，这是不是民歌精神里的消极因素呢？不是的。歌唱家这样告诉我们：“美国黑人的民歌（他们自己称作灵歌），是巧妙地把非洲曲调同圣经故事及基督教赞美歌的和声熔为一炉的。那些圣经中的故事既足以申诉奴隶制度下的痛苦和悲惨，又可以表达奴隶们所不能公开表示的对于自由的希望和企求。所以，这些歌曲就有着双重的意义。一方面歌颂天国以影射自由；一方面歌颂圣经里面的兵车以影射利用地下铁道来逃脱奴役。圣经里以色列的儿女们在埃及被奴役的故事是表现黑奴的命运和他们追求自由的希望的有力的借喻。”
    然而就从为数极少的某些黑人民歌中，我们仍然可以看到人们渴望自由是甚于上帝的。
    黑人民歌的朴实的音调，和以调式构成的旋律进行是平易近人的。我们并不因为地理上的距离而对它感到陌生。长时期遭受压迫的中国人民是很容易了解黑人民歌的，因而对潘基先生的表演感到十分亲切。每次音乐会的听众要求重唱的、往往就是这些动人的黑人民歌。
    除了克诺特科娃教授的精彩独奏节目外，还必须提到她在和歌唱家长期的合作中达到的、对他的节目的深刻理解。因而在她的手下，音乐和歌曲像汇合的溪流一般融合无间地倾泻出来。无疑的，这也是潘基先生得到成功的重要原因。
    我们希望继潘基先生之后，有更多的音乐家从美国来到新中国作访问演出。正像四国首脑会议指出的，加强东西方之间的文化交流，将有助于发展各国人民之间的友谊，从而加强了巩固世界和平的共同利益。
