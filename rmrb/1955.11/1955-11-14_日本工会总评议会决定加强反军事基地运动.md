　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan decided on the 12th to strengthen the movement against military bases nationwide.

　　The General Council is focusing its struggle on opposing the expansion of six U.S. Air Force bases: Tachikawa, Yokota, Kisarazu, Komaki, Niigata, and Itazuke. The General Council decided to fully support the residents of Sunagawa-cho in opposing the expansion of the Tachikawa base. It also announced its opposition to the establishment of atomic rocket gun target ranges in Japan, and to the expansion of the Otakane target range in Yamagata Prefecture and the Kamiike target range in Ibaraki Prefecture.

　　The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will submit petitions to the U.S. Embassy and the Japanese government on related issues.

　　At the same time, 20,000 Fukuoka citizens held a rally on the 12th, resolving to demand the removal of the Itazuke base and oppose the establishment of anti-aircraft gun positions by the U.S. military in Fukuoka. The meeting decided to send Fukuoka Mayor Haruo Konishi and thirteen others as representatives to petition the government and the Diet.

　　After the meeting, all the participants held a demonstration in front of the U.S. Consulate.

　　In Tateyama City, Chiba Prefecture, local fishermen firmly opposed the "Defense Agency's" plan to reuse the former Japanese Navy base in the area, because this plan would devastate the fishing industry. Workers supported the fishermen's struggle. Seventeen trade unions have begun collecting signatures on the streets since the 11th to oppose the restoration of the military base.
