Xinhua News Agency, 13th. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff, Twining, recently made an "inspection trip" to the Far East, to inspect the equipment of the U.S. Air Force in the Far East, and to study the issue of strengthening the U.S. Air Force's aggressive power in the Far East.
    On November 11th and 12th, Twining was active in Taiwan for two days. He held talks with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and the heads of the US-Chiang Air Force in Taiwan, discussing ways to strengthen the "air corridor" in the Taiwan Strait.
    Prior to this, Twining had held talks with Japanese and South Korean authorities on strengthening their air force capabilities.
    When Twining first arrived in Tokyo on November 1st, he threatened that "we may use" nuclear weapons "if we need them." Twining's belligerent remarks show that this "trip" was deliberately intended to maintain an atmosphere of tension in the Far East.

　　美国空军参谋长特文宁到远东活动
    新华社十三日讯　美国空军参谋长特文宁最近曾到远东作“视察旅行”，视察远东美国空军的设备和研究加强美国在远东的空军侵略力量的问题。
    十一月十一日和十二日，特文宁在台湾活动了两天。他曾和蒋介石卖国贼以及在台湾的美蒋空军首脑举行会谈，讨论了加强台湾海峡“空中走廊”的办法。
    在这以前，特文宁曾同日本和南朝鲜当局会谈加强它们的空军力量的问题。
    特文宁在十一月一日刚到东京时曾经威胁说，“我们可能使用”核子武器，“如果我们需要它们的话”。特文宁的这种好战的论调，表明他这次的“旅行”是蓄意在远东保持紧张空气。
