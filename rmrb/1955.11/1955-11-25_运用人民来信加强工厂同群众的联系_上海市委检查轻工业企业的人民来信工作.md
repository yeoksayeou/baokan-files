　　Using People's Letters to Strengthen the Connection Between Factories and the Masses
　　——Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Inspects Light Industrial Enterprises' People's Letter Work
　　By our reporter Ji Yin
    People's direct letters are one of the most vivid manifestations of the people's highly responsible spirit towards national affairs. Now that the nation's industrial construction is increasingly attracting the people's attention, and the connection between industrial products and people's lives is also continuously expanding and strengthening, the number of letters from the people in industrial and mining enterprises is also increasing day by day. Enthusiastically and responsibly handling these letters is a very important task for the Party organizations and administrations of industrial and mining enterprises.
    The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China recently led the Party organizations of some light industrial factories to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the work of handling people's letters in enterprises in the work of improving the quality of light industrial products. During the inspection, it was found that the number of people's letters in most factories was much higher than in the past. For example, six enterprises, including the joint state-private Zhengtai Rubber Factory, received a total of 914 letters from the people from January to August this year (of which one factory only had statistics for July and August). The letters came from all over the country. The letter writers included farmers, workers, government staff, and People's Liberation Army soldiers. With full enthusiasm, some put forward rationalization proposals to the factories, and more made sharp and pertinent criticisms of the poor quality of the products of these factories.
    One of the characteristics of people's letters in factory enterprises is that most of the letter writers are direct consumers of factory products, and the most reliable and fair appraisers of factory production work. Therefore, the opinions reflected by these letter writers have a great effect on improving the enterprise's production work and correcting shortcomings and errors in production work. The State-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 3 received a letter from the people in May this year, reflecting that some of the factory's cigarettes did not have trademark paper attached. Unfortunately, this letter was shelved for several months. Recently, the factory conducted an inspection based on this letter and found that the irresponsible phenomenon criticized in the letter was caused by Yang Zhangmei, the packaging worker on the No. 4 packaging team, who was about to be rewarded for "never having a quality accident." The factory immediately canceled the preferential reward for her and announced the incident to the masses. This gave the factory leaders and the masses a very beneficial education.
    The content of the people's letters in factory enterprises is extraordinarily rich, and some letters also include various materials and objects of great reference value to the factory, as well as original products damaged due to poor quality and other reasons during use. The State-owned Shanghai Bicycle Factory's "Forever" brand bicycles used to have many shortcomings. The people's letters put forward various specific suggestions, and some even attached improved drawings. A worker from the Wuxi Machine Tool Factory sent a drawing for improving the bicycle handlebar. A rural cadre wrote in a letter: "The mudguard of the car is very close to the tire. On rural dirt roads, if it encounters muddy roads, the mud will clog it and it will not be able to walk. People will have to carry it." In the second and third quarters of this year, the quality of some light industrial products in Shanghai once declined due to the one-sided implementation of savings. At this time, people's letters accused these companies of "not considering quality and people's requirements for the sake of saving," "strengthening service concepts," and "not producing poor quality products anymore." When the product quality was improved, the masses immediately wrote letters to welcome these product improvements and pointed out new directions for efforts. People's letters are like a barometer, accurately reflecting the changes in enterprise production and spurring enterprise leaders to continuously improve their work.
    People's letters also often raise some essential issues and point out the direction for enterprises to improve their work. For example, someone wrote a letter criticizing the poor quality of "Warrior" brand rubber shoes produced by Zhengtai Rubber Factory, saying that "Wanli shoes" had become "Shili shoes" and "Wuli shoes." The letter also pointed out that one of the reasons for the poor quality was that Zhengtai Rubber Factory "emphasized appearance over quality," "the style is good-looking, but not strong," and "what is published in the newspaper (advertising) does not match the reality." This correctly exposed Zhengtai Rubber Factory's capitalist business ideology and work style. Some people also wrote to the State-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 2 saying: "The one-sided view of saving that only cares about output and not quality will not only cause undue losses to consumers, but will also cause serious political and economic losses to state-owned enterprises." Although the opinions in many letters from the masses are often not very comprehensive, if the enterprise leaders can humbly listen to and study these opinions, it will be of great help to improving the production work of the enterprise.
    However, the Party organizations and administrations of many enterprises do not pay enough attention to the letters from the people. The State-owned Shanghai Cigarette Factory No. 2 received 81 letters from the people in eight months this year, reflecting the decline in the factory's product quality, but it did not attract the attention of the factory director and the Party committee. Some factories also treat the work of handling letters as a routine matter. For example, when a letter comes, it is answered by a clerk in the secretary's office with a pre-printed reply. These pre-printed letters contain a set of hypocritical and noncommittal pleasantries such as "our factory is extremely sorry" and "we hope to receive your criticism at any time." Or let these letters be "kicked around" and "circled around" between various departments, pushed back and forth, with no one responsible, and finally it is over. This bureaucratic attitude towards people's letters buries many valuable suggestions from the masses and causes losses to work that could have been avoided.
    This inspection revealed that many factory Party organizations do not care about the work of people's letters. Their reason is that "handling people's letters is only an administrative matter and has nothing to do with us." They even regard caring about the work of people's letters as interfering in administrative work. This view is completely wrong. The issue of how enterprises treat letters from the people is actually the issue of how to treat criticism and supervision from the people. The criticism and supervision of the people is the driving force for promoting the continuous advancement of our Party's various tasks, and the direct letters from the people is one of the most obvious manifestations of this mass supervision. Ignoring people's letters is actually blocking the criticism of the people and rejecting the supervision of the people. Shouldn't such major principled issues be put on the work agenda of the enterprise Party organization? Many facts in this inspection prove that handling people's letters is not only an administrative work, but also an important political and ideological work. People's letters oppose conservative ideas, complacency, capitalist business practices and various backward phenomena in enterprises. In this struggle with principled significance, the factory Party organization should not stand idly by at all, but should actively participate in and support this struggle.
    The facts in this inspection also show that people's letters are a very good teaching material for conducting ideological education for employees. Regularly publicizing the letters from the people and organizing discussions so that employees can regularly and specifically understand the relationship between their daily production activities and people's lives from these letters. This will have a great effect on strengthening employees' sense of responsibility to the people and promoting them to continuously improve production technology. Shanghai Joint State-Private Cuizhong Towel Factory recently publicized the masses' letters of criticism and the attached torn towels about the decline in the quality of "414" towels in correcting the quality decline of "414" towels. "414" towels used to be famous brands, and employees had a blind sense of complacency. The sharp criticism from the masses sounded an alarm to the employees. Hu Chunzi, a worker in the dyeing and finishing workshop, said after seeing the criticism from the masses: "I feel really sad. The peasant brothers work hard to grow cotton, and the transportation workers transport it to the city, and the workers in the spinning factory spend a lot of labor to spin it into yarn. You have to make a detailed account. The yarn used to make towels has already cost the efforts of many people! When I think of this, I toss and turn and can't sleep at night." The factory's workers carefully studied the reasons for the poor quality of the towels and decided to use improved production to respond to the consumers' criticism and expectations. From this example, it can be seen that handling people's letters is not only an administrative work, but also the Party's political and ideological work.
    Through this inspection work, the Party organizations of many factories have begun to pay attention to the letters from the people and have taken some measures to improve this work. For example, urging the administration to establish a set of systems for handling people's letters, assisting the administration in equipping appropriate cadres, and eliminating the phenomenon of no one being responsible in the past work of handling people's letters from the organization. At the same time, it is also stipulated that the administration should regularly report to the Party committee the major issues reflected in the letters from the people and the handling of the letters, and the Party committee meeting should conduct timely discussions. The Party organization also regularly inspects the administration's implementation of the handling of people's letters and includes these as one of the contents of the work report to the higher-level Party committee.
    Now many factories are improving product quality and increasing product varieties and patterns based on the opinions reflected in the letters from the people. Local State-owned Dafu Rubber Factory, Joint State-Private Guan Leming Gold Pen Factory and dozens of other factories will improve the quality of their products in the fourth quarter based on the opinions in the letters from the people. The criticism and supervision of the people have truly formed a huge force to promote the advancement of enterprises. The Party organizations of some factories still do not pay attention to this work. Some only conduct inspections for a while and do not take further active measures to consolidate and regularize this work, which should be improved.

　　运用人民来信加强工厂同群众的联系
　　——上海市委检查轻工业企业的人民来信工作
　　本报记者　季音
    人民群众的直接来信，是人民对国家事务高度负责精神最生动的表现之一。现在国家工业建设正日益引起人民的关怀，工业产品同人民生活的联系也在不断扩大和增强着，因此工矿企业中人民群众的来信，也一天比一天多起来了。热情地负责处理这些来信，是工矿企业党组织和行政一项很重要的工作。
    中共上海市委会最近在提高轻工业产品质量的工作中，曾领导一部分轻工业工厂的党组织，对企业处理人民来信的工作作了一次普遍的检查。在检查中，发现大部分工厂人民来信的数量都比过去多得多了。如公私合营正泰橡胶厂等六个企业，从今年一月到八月，共收到了人民来信九百一十四件
  （其中一个厂只有七、八两月的统计数字）。信件来自全国各地。写信的有农民、工人、机关工作人员、解放军战士等。他们以满腔热诚，有的对工厂提出了合理化建议，更多的是对这些厂的产品质量不好提出了尖锐的、中肯的批评。
    工厂企业中人民来信的一个特点，写信的人大部分是工厂产品的直接消费者，是工厂生产工作最可靠最公正的鉴定人。因此这些写信的人反映的意见，对于改进企业的生产工作，纠正生产工作中的缺点和错误，有着很大作用。国营上海卷烟三厂，在今年五月收到了一件人民来信，反映该厂有一部分纸烟竟没有贴商标纸。不幸这封信被搁置了几个月。最近厂里根据这封来信作了检查，才发现这封来信所批评的那种严重不负责任的现象，正是准备就要奖励“从来不出质量事故”的四号包装车上的包装工人杨章妹造成的。厂里就立即取消了给她的优胜奖励，并在群众中公布了这个事件。这给了厂的领导和群众一次很有益的教育。
    工厂企业的人民来信内容是异常丰富的，而且有些信件中还给工厂附来了各种极有参考价值的资料和实物，以及在使用过程中因质量不好等原因而损坏的产品原件。国营上海自行车厂过去出品的“永久牌”自行车有不少缺点，人民群众来信提出了各种具体建议，个别的还附来了改进的图样。无锡机床厂的一个工人就寄来了一份改进自行车把手的图样。一个农村干部来信说：“车的挡泥板和车胎离的很近，在农村土路上稍遇道路泥泞，泥土淤塞，就不能行走，势必要人来扛。”今年二、三季度，上海一部分轻工业品由于片面地实行节约的结果，质量一度下降。这时，人民来信纷纷指责这些企业
  “不能为了节约，不顾及质量及人民的要求”，
  “要加强服务观点”，“不要再生产坏品质的产品”。而当产品质量一旦有了改进后，群众又马上来信。欢迎这些产品的改进，又指出新的努力方向。人民来信就像一支晴雨表似的，正确地反映着企业生产的变化，鞭策着企业领导不断改进自己的工作。
    人民的来信还常常提出了一些本质性的问题，为企业改进工作指出了方向。例如有人来信批评正泰橡胶厂出品的“回力牌”胶鞋质量不好，“万里鞋”成了“十里鞋”、“五里鞋”。来信中还指出造成质量不好的原因之一是正泰橡胶厂“重外表不重质量”，“式样好看，但不坚固”，“报上登的（广告）与实际不符”。这是正确地揭发了正泰橡胶厂资本主义经营思想作风。也有人给国营上海卷烟二厂来信说：“只顾产量，不顾质量的片面节约观点，不但使消费者遭到不应有的损失，并将使国营企业在政治上、经济上受到严重的损失。”许多群众来信的意见虽然常常不是很全面的，但是如果企业领导上能够虚心地听取和研究这些意见的话，对改进本企业生产工作是有很大帮助的。
    但是有许多企业的党组织和行政对人民群众的来信是不够重视的。国营上海卷烟二厂今年八个月中接到了八十一封人民来信，反映该厂产品质量下降的情况，但是一直没有引起厂长和党委的重视。也有的工厂把处理来信工作，当成例行公事。例如，来了一封信，就由秘书科的科员用早就印好了的复信来答复。这种印好的信上有着“本厂异常抱歉”，“希望时惠批评”等等一套虚伪的、不着边际的客套。或者让这些来信，在各科室之间“踢皮球”、“兜圈子”，推来推去，无人负责，最后就不了了之。这种对待人民来信的官僚主义的态度，就使群众的许多宝贵建议被淹没无闻了，使工作受到了本来可以避免的损失。
    这次检查中，反映出了许多工厂党组织是不过问人民来信的工作的。他们的理由是“处理人民来信只是行政上的事情，与我们无关”。甚至把过问人民来信的工作，当做是干预行政工作。这种看法是完全错误的。企业中如何对待人民群众来信的问题，实际上就是如何对待人民群众的批评和监督的问题。人民群众的批评和监督，是推动我们党的各项工作不断前进的动力，而人民群众的直接来信，就是这种群众性的监督的最显明的表现之一。忽视人民来信，实际上就是阻塞人民群众的批评，拒绝人民群众的监督。像这样重大的原则问题，难道还不应当摆到企业党组织的工作日程上来吗？这次检查中的许多事实证明，处理人民来信不只是一件行政工作，同时更是一件重要的政治思想工作。人民来信反对企业中的保守思想、骄傲自满情绪、资本主义经营作风和各种落后现象。在这种具有原则意义的斗争中，工厂党组织是完全不应当袖手旁观的，而应该积极地参加和支持这一斗争。
    这次检查中的事实也说明，人民来信是对职工群众进行思想教育的一种很好的教材，经常公布人民群众的来信，并组织讨论，使职工从这些来信中经常地、具体地了解到他们日常的生产活动和人民生活的关系。这对于加强职工对人民负责的观点，推动他们不断地改进生产技术，是会有很大作用的。上海公私合营萃众毛巾厂，最近在纠正“四一四”毛巾质量下降的工作中，公布了群众对“四一四”毛巾的批评信和附来的破毛巾。“四一四”毛巾过去是名牌货，职工们都有盲目自满的情绪，群众来信的尖锐批评给职工们敲了警钟。漂染车间工人胡纯滋看到群众的批评后说：“我心里真难过。农民兄弟辛辛苦苦种出棉花来，运输工人把它运到城里，纱厂的工人又花很多劳力纺成纱，要算一笔细账，做毛巾用的纱，已经花了多少人的心血啊！我想起这件事，晚上就翻来复去睡不着觉。”全厂工人认真地研究出了毛巾质量不好的原因，决心用改进生产来回答消费者的批评和期望。从这个例子可以看出，处理人民来信不只是属于行政上的工作，也是党的政治思想工作。
    通过这次检查工作，许多工厂的党组织开始重视了人民来信，并且采取了一些措施来改进这一工作。如督促行政建立一套处理人民来信工作的制度，协助行政配备适当的干部，从组织上消除过去处理人民来信工作中的无人负责的现象。同时还规定行政上要定期向党委报告人民来信中所反映的重大问题和处理来信的情况，党委会上要及时进行讨论。党组织也定期检查行政对人民来信的处理执行情况，并把这些列为对上级党委工作报告的内容之一。
    现在不少厂已在根据人民群众来信所反映的意见，改进产品质量，增加产品品种和花式。地方国营大孚橡胶厂、公私合营关勒铭金笔厂等几十个工厂都将根据人民来信的意见来提高第四季度产品的质量。人民群众来信的批评和督促，真正形成了推动企业前进的巨大力量。还有些厂的党组织对这一工作仍未加以重视，有的只是检查一阵了事，而没有采取进一步的积极措施，把这项工作巩固和经常化，这是应该改善的。
