Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 31st: The Chinese Commodity Exhibition being held in Tokyo has caused a sensation throughout Tokyo and the surrounding prefectures. October 30th was the second Sunday since the exhibition opened, and the number of visitors reached 105,000, more than 20,000 more than the first Sunday, setting a new record since the exhibition opened on October 17th.

From October 17th to 30th, the exhibition has been visited by more than 530,000 people. Such enthusiastic attendance at an exhibition is unprecedented in Japan. Many people said that they never expected it to be so popular. The International Commodity Exhibition held in the same location in May of this year had a total of over 440,000 visitors over two weeks.

Among the visitors on October 30th, there were particularly many workers. They were extremely interested in Chinese machinery. Whenever Chinese workers operated the Model 1616 lathe to demonstrate high-speed cutting, hundreds of people would gather around to watch. This lathe, manufactured by the Jinan First Machine Tool Plant, can rotate 1,980 times per minute and can cut a foot-long piece of steel in less than 13 seconds. This high-speed cutting amazed the Japanese workers.

The Chinese films shown near the exhibition hall are also very popular with Japanese audiences. The cinema can only accommodate over 1,000 people, but each time there are 4,000 people queuing outside waiting to enter. As of October 30th, 120,000 people had watched Chinese films.

The Chinese bookstore in the lounge next to the exhibition hall is always packed with customers. In the past week or so, more than 15,000 books and pictures have been sold. The most popular are "People's Pictorial" and "People's China," which introduce various aspects of China. People who did not understand the situation in China in the past bought particularly many books. They bought almost all the existing Chinese books.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, October 30th: For more than ten days since the opening of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition, it has magnetically attracted many Japanese industrialists and businessmen. They came from Tokyo, Osaka, Hokkaido, Kyushu and other regions to visit and discuss business. Their first impression after the visit was: "Many of the things that Japan needs can be bought from China."

A reception room for business talks has been set up in the exhibition hall specifically for Japanese industrialists and businessmen. This reception room is crowded with people from morning to night. People coming in and out are constantly succeeding each other, and sometimes people have to queue outside the door. The four Chinese negotiators each have to talk to more than 20 guests every day, and it is difficult to find time to eat. As of the 29th, more than 1,000 representatives from more than 600 factories and commercial firms had conducted business talks with personnel from the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Group, involving all aspects. After learning that they could buy the goods they needed from a certain Chinese trading company, the Japanese industrialists and businessmen left happily with Chinese samples.

Industrialists and businessmen from Tokyo and other cities hope to buy Chinese mineral sands, coal, agricultural products, wine, leather, and feathers, and hope to sell various Japanese industrial products to China. Industrialists from Osaka and other textile industrial centers want to buy Chinese wool and cashmere. Shipbuilders from Hyogo Prefecture said: "If we do not export fishing boats to China, our shipyards will not be able to survive."

Representatives of dozens of Japanese grain merchants and manufacturers want to buy Chinese soybeans. The representative of Tokyo's Kyokurin Company said that due to the "embargo" policy, he could not buy soybeans from China and had to import them from the United States. He said: "Chinese soybeans contain more protein than American soybeans. Japan is far from the United States, so the freight is very high, and soybeans often heat up and rot in the hold."

    东京中国商品展览会已有五十多万人参观
    前往参观的日工商业家迫切希望同中国进行自由贸易
    据新华社东京三十一日电　在东京举办的中国商品展览会已经轰动了整个东京和附近的各县。十月三十日是展览会开幕以来的第二个星期天，来参观的人达十万五千人，比第一个星期天多两万多人，成为展览会自十月十七日开幕以来的最高纪录。
    从十月十七日到三十日止，展览会的参观者已有五十三万多人。参观展览会的人这样踊跃，在日本还是第一次。好多人都说，真想不到会这样热烈。今年五月间在同一个地方举办的国际商品展览会，两星期间共有四十几万人参观。
    十月三十日来参观的人中，工人特别多。他们对中国的机器发生了极大的兴趣。每当中国工人开动一六一六型车床，表演高速切削法时，总有好几百个人在旁边围着看。这个车床是济南第一机床厂制造的，每分钟能转动一千九百八十次，不到十三秒钟就可以削完一尺多长的钢料。这样高速度的切削，使日本工人感到惊奇。
    在展览馆附近放映的中国电影也同样受到日本观众们的欢迎。电影馆只能容纳一千多人，但是每次总有四千人在门外排队等候入场。到十月三十日为止已有十二万人看了中国的电影。
    在展览馆旁休息室中的中国书店，总是被顾客包围得水泄不通。一个多星期以来，已经卖出了一万五千多本书和画片等。销售最多的是介绍中国各方面情况的“人民画报”和“人民中国”。过去对中国情况不了解的人，买书的尤其多。他们把现有的中国书籍几乎完全买尽。
    据新华社东京三十日电　中国商品展览会开幕十多天以来，像磁石般的吸引了许多日本工商业家。他们从东京、大阪、北海道、九州等地区赶来参观和交谈生意。他们参观后的第一个印象是：“日本所需要的东西，很多可以从中国买到”。
    展览馆内专为日本工商业者设立了一个交谈生意的接待室。这个接待室每天从早到晚都挤满了人。进进出出的人接踵不断，有时人们还需要排着队在门外等候。四个中国接谈人员，每人每天都要和二十多个客人交谈，一天很难找到吃饭的时间。到二十九日为止，已有六百多家工厂和商行的代表约一千多人和中国商品展览团人员进行了涉及各方面的业务交谈。日本工商业家得知可以从中国某个贸易公司买到他们所需要的货物以后，就带着中国的样本愉快地离去了。
    从东京和其他城市来的工商业者希望能买到中国的矿砂、煤、农产品、酒、皮革、羽毛等，并且希望把日本的各种工业品卖给中国。大阪和其他纺织工业中心的工业家们要买中国的羊毛和紫羊绒。来自兵库县的造船工业家说：“如果不向中国输出渔船，我们的造船厂就无法维持下去”。
    有几十家日本粮商和制造商的代表要买中国的大豆。东京曲林公司的代表说：由于“禁运”政策，他不能从中国买到大豆，而不得不从美国运进。他说：“中国的大豆所含的蛋白质比美国的多。日本离美国很远，因此运费很高，并且大豆在船舱里经常发热腐烂。”
