To the Editor:

　　The former director of the Pan Village District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jiashan County, Anhui Province, Li Shouchong, arbitrarily squandered state property and embezzled public funds for a long period without repayment.

　　In September 1953, Li Shouchong was in Nanjing for medical treatment. Without going through any approval procedures, he used more than 490 yuan of public funds to buy sofas, long tables, and delicate thermos bottles. In March of this year, he again arbitrarily used 820 yuan of public funds to purchase two radios, a microphone, an amplifier, and a record player. He also borrowed 300 yuan of public funds, and after his treatment was changed to a salary system, he did not take the initiative to repay it. Now that he has been transferred, he is taking the opportunity to default on the debt and leave.

　　Under his influence, extravagance and waste are very serious in this cooperative. For example, when the state decided to merge the grain and oil sales institutions into the cooperative in April this year, the cooperative even used "dinner parties" as an excuse for lavish eating and drinking, resulting in the spending of 450 yuan of public funds. The phenomenon of staff arbitrarily borrowing public funds is very common. Before the staff's treatment was changed to a salary system, the amount of public funds borrowed privately reached 1,500 yuan; after the change to a salary system, many people did not take the initiative to repay it.

　　We request the Jiashan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative to quickly investigate this issue and make appropriate arrangements.

　  制止挥霍浪费挪用公款的行为编辑同志：
    安徽省嘉山县潘村区供销合作社前任主任李守忠任意挥霍国家财产，并且挪用公款长期不还。
    一九五三年九月，李守忠在南京治病。他不经过任何批准手续，就动用公款四百九十多元买回沙发、长桌和精致的热水瓶。今年三月，他又擅自动用公款八百二十元购买收音机两架，麦克风、扩音器和留声机各一台。他还借支了公款三百元，改薪金制待遇后也不主动归还，现在调动工作，就乘机赖债，扬长而去了。
    在他的影响下，这个社里铺张浪费现象很严重。如今年四月国家决定将粮油销售机构合并到合作社的时候，社里竟以“会餐”为名大吃大喝，结果花去公款四百五十元。社里工作人员任意借支公款的现象很普遍。在工作人员待遇改为薪金制以前，私人借支公款的数目达一千五百元；改薪金制后，很多人都不主动归还。
    我们要求嘉山县供销合作总社迅速检查这个问题，并作出适当的处理。
