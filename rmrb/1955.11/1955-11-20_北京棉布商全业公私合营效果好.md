The Beijing private cotton cloth merchants have implemented a whole-industry public-private partnership in October. This is a precedent in the socialist transformation of private commerce nationwide. In just over a month, it has been initially proven that the implementation of a whole-industry public-private partnership in private commerce has great advantages.

The private cotton cloth merchants in Beijing originally had shortcomings such as backward management, capital shortages, and an unreasonable distribution of the commercial network. After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth in September last year, the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce approved 142 private cotton cloth merchants in the city to act as distributors for the Beijing branch of the China Cotton Yarn and Fabrics Company. Before the end of August, combined with the adjustment of the commercial network, some cotton cloth stores were guided to adopt methods of "large leading small" and "advanced leading backward" to carry out mergers and joint operations. After preliminary transformation, business operations generally improved. However, the shortcomings existing in this private industry have not been greatly changed, and some cotton cloth stores are still experiencing losses. In order to further transform this industry, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee accepted the application of the cotton cloth industry capitalists and approved the implementation of a whole-industry public-private partnership in this industry. After preparations in various aspects, on October 1st, the urban cotton cloth merchants officially announced the implementation of a whole-industry public-private partnership.

After the implementation of the whole-industry public-private partnership in each district's cotton cloth stores, they began to be able to uniformly allocate funds. For example, the cotton cloth stores in the Qianmen district, which had more funds, allocated 20,000 yuan to the cotton cloth stores in the Xidan district and 5,000 yuan to the cotton cloth stores in the Dongsi district, reducing the difficulties caused by capital shortages in the Xidan and Dongsi districts. Commodity varieties have also begun to be adjusted between the cotton cloth stores in each district. This has enriched the stock of goods in each cotton cloth store, increased the variety of colors and patterns, and thus enabled them to better carry out business and meet the needs of consumers.

The implementation of a whole-industry public-private partnership provides favorable conditions for further adjusting the commercial network. At present, the work of adjusting the city's cotton cloth commercial network is being planned uniformly, and some cotton cloth stores have already been merged and reorganized.

After the implementation of the whole-industry public-private partnership, the state has strengthened its leadership over the cotton cloth stores through public representatives, and the relationship between the state-owned economy and the cotton cloth stores has been further strengthened. The enthusiasm of the vast majority of store employees has greatly increased. At present, the store employees in Xisi, Chongwen and other districts have launched labor competitions to actively improve business management. Under the leadership and promotion of public representatives, various systems are being established and improved in each cotton cloth store. All the original actual position personnel and capitalist agents have also been properly arranged. The vast majority of capitalists support the implementation of a whole-industry public-private partnership, and many people have actively participated in the preparation of the public-private partnership and the improvement of business management under the leadership of public representatives. After the implementation of the public-private partnership, the reputation of these cotton cloth stores among consumers has also improved.

Due to the above reasons, coupled with the arrival of the peak season, the turnover of each cotton cloth store is showing an upward trend. The turnover of cotton cloth stores in Qianmen, Chongwen, Xidan and other districts in October increased by more than 30% compared with September.

At present, the city's public-private partnership cotton cloth stores are studying further strengthening the unified management of business operations and the unified allocation of funds, and will implement unified calculation and unified distribution of surplus profits. In this way, the Beijing cotton cloth merchants can fundamentally solve the problem of unbalanced operations, enable each cotton cloth store to carry out business normally, make full use of existing equipment, expand commodity circulation, and lay the foundation for further socialist transformation.

### 北京棉布商全业公私合营效果好

　　北京棉布商全业公私合营效果好
    本报讯　北京市私营棉布座商在十月间实行全行业公私合营。这在全国私营商业的社会主义改造中是一个先例。短短一个多月的时间，已经初步证明私营商业实行全行业公私合营有很大的优越性。
    北京市私营棉布座商原来存在经营管理落后、资金短绌和商业网分布不合理等缺点。去年九月国家实行棉布统购统销以后，北京市工商行政机关批准全市一百四十二户私营棉布座商作为中国花纱布公司北京市公司的经销店；八月底以前，又结合调整商业网，引导一部分棉布店采取以大带小、以先进带落后的办法，进行了并店联营。经过初步改造，营业情况一般都有所改善。但是这个私营行业存在的缺点还没有得到很大的改变，一部分棉布店还有亏损现象。为了进一步对这个行业进行改造，北京市人民委员会接受棉布业资本家的申请，批准这个行业实行全行业公私合营。经过各方面的筹备，十月一日，城区棉布座商正式宣布全行业公私合营。
    各区棉布店在实行全行业公私合营以后，开始能够统一调剂资金。如资金较多的前门区棉布店把资金调剂给西单区棉布店二万元，调剂给东四区棉布店五千元，使资金较少的西单区和东四区的棉布店减少了因资金短绌而引起的困难。各区棉布店之间也开始调剂了商品品种。这样，就使各棉布店充实了货源，增加了品种花色，因而能更好地开展业务，供应消费者的需要。
    实行全行业公私合营，为进一步调整商业网提供了有利的条件。目前，调整全市棉布商业网的工作正在统一规划，部分棉布店已经进行了合并改组。
    全行业公私合营以后，国家通过公方工作人员加强了对棉布店的领导，国营经济同棉布店的关系进一步密切。广大店员职工的积极性大为提高。目前，西四、崇文等区各棉布店的店员职工已经展开劳动竞赛，积极改善经营管理。各棉布店都在公方代表领导推动下，建立和健全各种制度。所有原来的资方实职人员和资本家代理人，也得到了适当的安排。绝大部分资本家都拥护实行全行业公私合营，许多人在公方代表的领导下，积极参加了筹备公私合营和改善经营管理等工作。实行公私合营以后，这些棉布店在消费者中的信誉也提高了。
    由于上述各种原因，加以旺季来临，各棉布店营业额都呈上升趋势。前门、崇文、西单等区棉布店十月份的营业额都比九月份增加百分之三十以上。
    目前，全市公私合营棉布店正在研究进一步加强业务经营的统一管理和资金的统一调配，并将对盈余利润实行统一计算和统一分配。这样，北京市棉布座商就可以从根本上解决经营不平衡的问题，使各棉布店都能正常地开展业务，充分利用原有设备，扩大商品流转，并为进一步进行社会主义改造打下基础。
