Learning from the Soviet "Best Steelworker of the Nation" Kolesnikov's Steelmaking Experience
    The Technical Level of China's Steelworkers Has Recently Improved Significantly
    (Reported by this newspaper) Kolesnikov, a member of the Soviet youth delegation invited to China to participate in the National Congress of Young Socialist Construction Activists and a worker at the Soviet Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Combine who had won the title of "Best Steelworker of the Nation," gave several demonstrations of rapid steelmaking at Anshan Iron and Steel Works and other units during his visit to China. With Kolesnikov's personal assistance, Chinese steelworkers have further learned and mastered advanced operating methods, and their steelmaking technical level has improved significantly, continuously creating new achievements in practice.
    On October 8, Kolesnikov gave his first rapid steelmaking demonstration at Anshan Iron and Steel Works, creating a record of shortening the standard rapid steelmaking time by one hour and thirty-five minutes. Subsequently, Kolesnikov introduced the new Soviet rapid steelmaking technologies in detail at a discussion forum. Steelworkers learned his advanced operating methods. On October 9, the steelworkers of Shift B of No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace first created a new record for rapid steelmaking in large open hearth furnaces, shortening the planned steelmaking time by three hours and ten minutes. On October 11, the workers of this shift set a new record of seven hours to make one furnace of steel, shortening the planned steelmaking time by three and a half hours. On October 20, the employees of Shift B of No. 5 Open Hearth Furnace also created a new record for rapid steelmaking in medium-sized open hearth furnaces, producing one furnace of steel in five hours and fifty minutes, shortening the planned steelmaking time by three hours and forty minutes. Anshan Iron and Steel Works produced a total of 214 furnaces of rapid steel in October, 69 furnaces more than the number of rapid steel produced in the three months of the third quarter of this year.
    On October 15, Kolesnikov and steelworkers from Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant jointly produced a furnace of steel. The smelting time for this furnace of steel was shortened by 41 minutes compared to the operation plan. Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant then summarized his advanced operating methods and implemented them comprehensively in each open hearth furnace. On October 27, the night shift workers of No. 1 Open Hearth Furnace used his experience to create a new record of producing a furnace of steel one hour and eighteen minutes shorter than planned, and the quality of the steel was also very good.
    On October 25, all steel plants in Chongqing sent technicians and workers to Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant to observe Kolesnikov's rapid steelmaking demonstration. On this day, Kolesnikov and Chinese workers together produced a furnace of steel in four hours and fifty-three minutes, shortening the rapid steelmaking time stipulated by the plant by one hour and seven minutes, creating the latest record since the large open hearth furnace of this plant was put into production. The steelworkers of this plant immediately learned his advanced operating techniques in charging, patching the furnace, slag making, and controlling gas, and created two new records in a row on October 25 and 26, shortening the average smelting time per furnace of steel to five hours and nineteen minutes. After the steelworkers of Chongqing No. 3 Steel Plant visited, they also created a new record of producing a furnace of steel in four hours and twenty minutes using Kolesnikov's operating methods, shortening the original general smelting time by about half an hour. This plant also made five resolutions to promote Kolesnikov's rapid steelmaking method in order to strive to produce more steel.
    The No. 3 Open Hearth Furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant was already old. On October 30, Kolesnikov gave his fourth rapid steelmaking performance here. He once again skillfully used advanced Soviet steelmaking technology on this old furnace, and it took only five hours and twenty-seven minutes to produce a furnace of steel, shortening the average steelmaking time under the same conditions in the past by two hours and one minute. After the workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant learned his advanced operating methods, they also achieved new successes. The three furnaces of steel produced by the workers of this plant on the No. 3 Open Hearth Furnace immediately afterwards all shortened the time, and the best furnace of steel smelting took only five hours and forty-five minutes. After this visit, the representatives of various steel plants under the Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry are also summarizing their gains in learning and preparing to return to the plants to promote them.

    学习苏联“国家最好的钢铁工人”科列斯尼科夫炼钢经验
    我国炼钢工人的技术水平最近显著提高
    本报讯　应邀来中国参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的苏联青年代表团团员、曾经荣获
  “国家最好的钢铁工人”称号的苏联马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁联合工厂工人科列斯尼科夫在中国访问期间，曾在鞍钢炼钢厂等单位作了多次快速炼钢的表演。我国炼钢工人在科列斯尼科夫的亲自帮助下，进一步学习并掌握了先进的操作方法，炼钢技术水平有了显著提高，在实践中不断创造新成绩。
    十月八日，科列斯尼科夫在鞍钢炼钢厂作了第一次快速炼钢的表演，并创造了比快速炼钢标准时间缩短一小时三十五分的纪录。随后，科列斯尼科夫又在座谈会上详尽地介绍了苏联快速炼钢的新技术。炼钢工人们学习了他的先进操作方法。一号平炉乙班炼钢工人首先在十月九日创造了大型平炉快速炼钢新纪录，比计划炼钢时间缩短了三小时零十分。这个班的工人在十月十一日再创七小时炼一炉钢的最新纪录，比计划炼钢时间缩短了三小时半。五号平炉乙班职工在十月二十日又创造了中型平炉快速炼钢的新纪录，他们以五小时五十分钟炼出一炉钢，比计划炼钢时间缩短了三小时四十分钟。鞍钢炼钢厂在十月份共出了二百十四炉快速炼钢，比今年第三季度三个月中所出的快速炼钢数目还要多六十九炉。
    科列斯尼科夫又在十月十五日同上海第一钢厂炼钢工人共同炼了一炉钢。这炉钢的冶炼时间比作业计划缩短了四十一分钟。上海第一钢厂随即总结他的先进操作方法，在各平炉全面推行。十月二十七日，一号平炉夜班工人运用他的经验，创造了比计划缩短一小时十八分钟炼出一炉钢的新纪录，钢的质量也很好。
    重庆各钢铁厂在十月二十五日都派了技术人员和工人到重庆第一钢铁厂参观科列斯尼科夫的快速炼钢表演。这一天科列斯尼科夫同中国工人一起，以四小时五十三分钟的时间炼出一炉钢，比这个厂规定的快速炼钢时间缩短了一小时零七分钟，创造了这个厂的大型平炉投入生产以来的最新纪录。这个厂的炼钢工人们立即学习了他的装料、补炉、造渣、控制煤气等方面的先进操作技术，在十月二十五日、二十六日连续创造两次新纪录，把每炉钢平均冶炼时间缩短为五小时十九分钟。重庆第三钢铁厂炼钢职工在参观后，运用科列斯尼科夫的操作方法，也创造了以四小时二十分钟炼出一炉钢的新纪录，比原来的一般冶炼时间缩短了半小时左右。这个厂并作出了推广科列斯尼科夫快速炼钢法的五项决议，以争取生产更多的钢。
    太原钢铁厂三号平炉原已老旧，十月三十日，科列斯尼科夫在这里作了第四次快速炼钢表演。他在这一老旧的炉子上再一次熟练地运用了苏联先进炼钢技术，只用了五小时二十七分钟的时间便炼出一炉钢，比过去在同一条件下平均炼钢时间缩短了两小时零一分钟。太原钢铁厂的工人们学习他的先进操作方法以后，也取得了新成就。这个厂的工人在三号平炉上紧接着炼出的三炉钢，都缩短了时间，其中最好的一炉钢的冶炼只用了五小时四十五分钟。重工业部钢铁工业管理局组织所属各炼钢厂代表在这次参观以后，也正在总结学习中的收获，准备回厂推广。
