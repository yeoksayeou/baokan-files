Comrades and friends!
    We are gathered here in a grand meeting to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. November 7th, this glorious day, is a joyous festival not only for the Soviet people but also for the working people of the world and all peace-loving people. The Chinese people, who are striving to build our motherland into a prosperous and strong socialist country and at the same time to defend the cause of lasting peace in the Far East and the world, celebrate this great festival today with the greatest joy. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people and all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, to express our highest respect to our great ally, the strong fortress of world peace – the great Soviet Union! To our best friends, the great Soviet people who are victoriously building communism, we extend our heartfelt congratulations!
    The victory of the October Revolution, directly led by the great revolutionary teacher Lenin, ushered in a new era in human history and illuminated the path to complete liberation for the proletariat and all working people around the world. On this path, the Soviet people have already created a brilliant and splendid achievement; the people of China and the people's democratic countries are learning from the Soviet example and striving to carry out socialist construction; and the people of other countries in the world are increasingly longing for the Soviet Union and for a better future for all mankind. Now, more and more people in the world realize that the bright path opened up by the great October Revolution is the inevitable path for the development of human history. At the same time, people are also increasingly aware that the great achievement of the October Revolution—the Soviet Union—is a strong bulwark of lasting world peace.
    Since its birth, the great Soviet Union has followed Lenin's teachings and taken the principle of coexistence between different social systems as the basis of its foreign policy. For thirty-eight years, the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy has continuously made great contributions to maintaining world peace and ensuring the security of all countries. In the past two years, the unremitting efforts made by the Soviet Union and the peace forces of the world to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace have produced positive results. Everyone knows that the Soviet Union, China, and the peace-loving forces of the world once promoted the Korean armistice in 1953 and the restoration of peace in Indochina in 1954, thereby leading to some easing of the international situation. However, due to the "cold war" creators rearming West Germany and the signing of the Paris Agreement that dragged West Germany into the Western military bloc, and due to the establishment of the Manila aggressive military alliance, the easing of tensions in international relations has once again encountered major obstacles. In this situation, the Soviet Union and the peace-loving forces of the world have taken a series of correct measures. In the Far East, the Soviet Union actively supported the resolutions of the Bandung Asian-African Conference and supported the proposal put forward by our government for direct Sino-American talks. In Europe, in the face of the serious threat from Western countries caused by the Paris Agreement, the eight European countries headed by the Soviet Union signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance in Warsaw, which played a major role in maintaining peace in Europe and the world. Then, in May this year, the Soviet government put forward new proposals on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and the elimination of the threat of war. The Soviet government also facilitated the signing of the Austrian State Treaty. This treaty not only enabled Austria to fully restore its independence and embark on the road of peaceful development, but also, because Austria took the path of neutrality, had a good impact on the entire political situation in Europe and greatly contributed to the easing of international tensions. At the end of May and the beginning of June this year, the Soviet government delegation visited Yugoslavia, improved Soviet-Yugoslav relations, and once again made a great contribution to the cause of peace in Europe and the world. The joint statement issued by the heads of government of the Soviet Union and India showed the consensus of the Soviet Union and India, two major countries, on the pressing issues of world peace, and showed that the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Indian people are becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. Due to this series of positive steps by the Soviet Union and the efforts of peace-loving forces around the world, the Four-Power Summit Conference in Geneva was convened in July this year. This conference generated the "Geneva spirit" of resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation, and promoted further easing of international tensions.
    In the past two or three months, the Soviet Union has taken many practical steps to realize this "Geneva spirit" and has been supported by all peace-loving people. The Soviet Union took the initiative to establish diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany, and the Treaty on Relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic has been concluded and has come into effect. The normal relations between the Soviet Union and the two countries existing on German territory will undoubtedly help to ease international tensions in the heart of Europe and will have a good impact on the settlement of the German question. After the Geneva Conference, the Soviet Union reduced its armed forces by 640,000 men. At the same time, in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the Soviet Union took the initiative to propose the abandonment of the Porkkala Peninsula naval base in Finnish territory before the stipulated time limit. These steps by the Soviet Union not only further strengthened friendly relations with the countries concerned, but also won the praise of public opinion in various countries around the world. In addition, while actively striving to prohibit atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet Union has also taken a positive attitude toward international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy and has made great contributions. The Soviet Union has also actively expanded contact with people from all walks of life in other countries, and has enhanced communication and understanding between countries in various aspects. These efforts by the Soviet Union have made the spirit of consultation and cooperation increasingly influential in international relations. At present, the international peace forces are continuing to develop. The call for seeking international understanding, mutual trust, and the development of international friendly relations, advocated by the Soviet Union, China, and other peace-loving countries, has become the unanimous voice of the majority of countries in the world and the vast number of people with various different beliefs and different ideas. The people of all countries are firmly demanding that the current Four Foreign Ministers' Conference follow the "Geneva spirit" and make concrete contributions to the cause of international peace and security. The people of all countries united in the struggle for peace, led by the great standard-bearer of world peace—the Soviet Union, are forming a powerful front of peace defenders against the war bloc, and are increasingly attracting more and more people to join this front. We Chinese people are forever united with the great Soviet people. The facts of the past few years have fully proved Chairman Mao Zedong's words: "The strong alliance between China and the Soviet Union is an invincible force, a strong guarantee against imperialist aggression and for safeguarding peace and security in the Far East, and also a guarantee for the victory of the great cause of world peace." The rock-solid friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet people will always be a powerful factor in defending peace in the Far East and the world!
    Comrades, friends! We are particularly pleased when celebrating the 38th anniversary of the October Revolution because this year is the year of the successful completion of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan. On the eve of this great festival, the glorious Soviet people are struggling with selfless labor to successfully complete and comprehensively over fulfill the Fifth Five-Year Plan, and are launching a large-scale socialist labor competition to welcome the upcoming 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan is a magnificent construction plan made to further advance the Soviet Union from socialism to communism. The production target for the Fifth Five-Year Plan in industry was completed ahead of schedule before May 1 this year, that is, it was completed in four years and four months. In 1955, the level of industrial production in the Soviet Union increased more than twofold compared with the pre-war level. The Soviet people, following the teachings of the great Lenin, are striving to implement the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, which the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has consistently adhered to. Therefore, the production of the means of production will increase by at least 84 percent by the end of 1955 compared with 1950, accounting for more than 70 percent of the total industrial output of the Soviet Union. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the Soviet people are taking various measures to greatly increase agricultural production, stipulating that in the next few years, the annual output of grain should be increased to at least 10 billion poods, and livestock products should be increased to two to two and a half times. In the past two years, the Soviet Union has reclaimed more than 20 million hectares of wasteland and sown seeds on more than 20 million hectares of land. This year, the Soviet Union has once again achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture. With the rapid increase in industrial and agricultural production, the material and cultural life of the Soviet people is also constantly improving. This year, the production level of consumer goods in the Soviet Union has increased by 72 percent compared with 1950, which greatly exceeds the original stipulation of the Fifth Five-Year Plan to increase by 65 percent. Soviet culture and science are advancing at an astonishing rate to a new peak of human civilization.
    The completion of the Soviet Union's Fifth Five-Year Plan is a great victory for the Soviet people in their struggle to advance their country towards communism. This victory not only further strengthened the economic strength and defense strength of the Soviet Union, but also greatly enhanced the strength of the united peace-democracy camp. This is another great contribution of the Soviet Union to world peace. All progressive mankind in the world is rejoicing for this great victory of the Soviet people. We Chinese people are particularly pleased with this great victory of our great ally, the Soviet Union.
    The Chinese people's struggle to build socialism, like the Soviet people's struggle to build their own country, is guided by the theory of Marxism-Leninism, takes the practice of Soviet socialist construction as an example, and is also carried out with the great selfless assistance of the Soviet government and people. The great achievements of Soviet socialist construction and the fraternal selfless assistance to our country are extremely important and favorable conditions for us to achieve the victory of socialist construction.
    The experience of Soviet socialist construction proves that: to build the economic foundation of socialism, it is necessary to implement the policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and to establish a socialist large-scale industrial system on the basis of heavy industry; it is necessary to transfer the national economy, including agriculture, to the technical basis of large-scale production, that is, it is necessary to first organize the scattered individual farmers into collectively operated agricultural production cooperatives; it is necessary to change the national economy, which includes multiple economic components, into a single socialist economy, actively develop socialist economic components, and utilize, restrict, and transform non-socialist economic components; it is necessary to regard cultural revolution and socialist cultural construction as an important task, and to directly link socialist construction with improving the cultural level of the working people. There is no doubt that these valuable experiences are particularly important for the Chinese people who are building socialism. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people have already and will continue to correctly apply these valuable experiences based on China's specific conditions and characteristics. Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out in 1952: From the founding of the People's Republic of China to the completion of socialism, this is a transitional period. The general line of the Party during the transitional period is to gradually realize socialist industrialization and gradually complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. This general line has been incorporated into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China in 1954 as the general task of the country during the transitional period. According to this general task, we have formulated and are implementing the great First Five-Year Plan for the Development of the National Economy. Recently, Chairman Mao Zedong's historically significant work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," as well as the relevant resolutions made by the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on actively developing agricultural production cooperatives nationwide and gradually realizing agricultural cooperation, guarantees that it will be possible to basically complete cooperation of a semi-socialist nature in most parts of the country by 1958; this will lay a good foundation for further completing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Regarding the question of gradually weakening and even eliminating capitalist economic components during the transitional period, we have also formulated and implemented policies of utilizing, restricting, and transforming private industry and commerce; recently, Chairman Mao Zedong's relevant instructions at the National Congress of Industry and Commerce are an important guarantee for further implementing this policy. In terms of cultural construction, we are also learning from the model of Soviet socialist culture and implementing a large-scale socialist cultural construction plan; in this regard, the ongoing and continuing movement to promote materialism and criticize bourgeois idealism is of particular significance for our country's socialist construction. All of this convincingly proves this truth: With the experience of Soviet socialist construction as a reference and with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the great project of socialist construction of our Chinese people will surely achieve complete victory; like the Soviet Union, we will be able to establish a consolidated, prosperous, and strong socialist society on the land of our great motherland.
    The reason why we will surely achieve victory is not only because we have the experience of the Soviet Union as an example, but also because we have received the great selfless assistance of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union has continuously provided significant assistance to our country's economic recovery through various means such as loans, trade, dispatching experts, and supplying equipment. Since our country entered the period of the First Five-Year Plan in 1953, the economic cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has achieved comprehensive development, and the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to our country's economic construction has become even more comprehensive and systematic. The focus of the First Five-Year Plan is industrial construction, and the focus of industrial construction is the construction of 156 units aided by the Soviet Union. The 156 units include modern iron and steel joint enterprises, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mining enterprises, petroleum enterprises, various heavy machinery manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, aircraft manufacturing plants, power stations, chemical plants, etc. These projects are the backbone of the 2,994 industrial construction units newly built and expanded in our country's First Five-Year Plan. Some people call them the "lifeblood" of our country's industrialization, which is completely correct. The technology of these construction units is very complex, so from surveying geology, selecting factory sites, collecting basic design data, conducting design, supplying equipment, guiding construction and installation and start-up, supplying technical data for new products, to manufacturing new products, the Soviet Union provides comprehensive assistance from beginning to end. These units are equipped with the latest modern technology, and 50 to 70 percent of their main equipment is supplied by the Soviet Union. Managing these modern enterprises requires a high level of technology. In order to enable us to master these new enterprises, a large number of experts have been sent by the Soviet Union, and workers and technicians from these enterprises have been accepted to study and intern in the Soviet Union. The 156 construction units are the most important aspect of the Soviet Union's assistance to our country's First Five-Year Plan. In addition, in various departments of national economic construction and cultural construction, such as: agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, railways, transportation, postal and telecommunications, construction, geology, culture, education, science, health, etc., we have all received extensive and multi-faceted assistance from the Soviet Union. It is particularly worth mentioning that the Soviet Union has provided our country with technical and industrial assistance in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Soviet Union has planned to build an experimental atomic pile with a heating capacity of 6,500 kilowatts for our country, and the heating capacity can be increased to 10,000 kilowatts if necessary. This will enable our country to master the world's most advanced atomic energy science and technology in a short period of time. It can be imagined that in the near future, atomic energy will be able to serve our country's peaceful construction cause.
    The Soviet Union's great, long-term, comprehensive, and selfless assistance to our country is a great initiative that has never existed in the history of international relations. The Soviet Union's assistance to our country is a manifestation of a completely new type of fraternal cooperation relationship, as Stalin said, it is based on "mutual assistance and a sincere desire to seek common economic growth." This cooperation is not only conducive to the prosperity and progress of our two countries, but also extremely conducive to world peace and the happiness of all mankind. All the Chinese people express their most sincere gratitude to our great ally, the Soviet Union, and the great Soviet people for this assistance to the Chinese people with indescribable gratitude!
    Comrades, friends! The eternal and unbreakable friendship between China and the Soviet Union is the guarantee of our past, present, and future victories. The people of the whole country understand that they must protect this greatest friendship as they protect their own eyes. We must make every effort to further consolidate and develop the deep friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, and we must work harder to learn from the example of the Soviet people and build our great motherland into a prosperous, strong, and glorious socialist country. We will always be with the Soviet Union and strive for the great cause of socialism and the cause of world peace.
    Long live the 38th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution!
    Long live the strong fortress of world peace and the example of our socialist construction—the great Soviet Union!
    Long live the strong factor of world peace—the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people!

    在北京庆祝十月社会主义革命三十八周年大会上
    中苏友好协会总会副会长吴玉章的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们在这里举行隆重的集会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念日。十一月七日这个光辉的日子，不仅是苏联人民的、而且也是全世界劳动人民和一切爱好和平的人们的欢乐的节日。正在为着把我们祖国建设成为繁荣富强的社会主义国家、同时为着保卫远东和世界持久和平事业而奋斗的中国人民，今天以最大的欢乐来庆祝这个伟大的节日。请允许我以中国人民和中苏友好协会全体会员的名义，向我们伟大的盟邦、世界和平的坚强堡垒——伟大的苏联，表示崇高的敬意！向我们最好的朋友，正在胜利地建设共产主义的伟大的苏联人民，致以衷心的祝贺！
    由伟大革命导师列宁直接领导的十月革命的胜利，开创了人类历史的新纪元，照亮了全世界无产阶级和全体劳动人民彻底解放的道路。在这条道路上，苏联人民已经创造了光辉灿烂的业绩；我们中国和各人民民主国家的人民，正在学习苏联的榜样，努力进行社会主义的建设；世界上其他国家的人民也日益向往着苏联，向往着全人类美好的未来。现在，世界上愈来愈多的人们，都认识到伟大的十月革命所开辟的光明大道，乃是人类历史发展的必由之路。同时，人们也愈来愈清楚地看到，十月革命的伟大成果——苏联，乃是世界持久和平的坚强堡垒。
    伟大的苏联从它诞生以来，就遵循着列宁的教导，以不同社会制度共处的原则作为它的外交政策的基础。三十八年来，苏联的和平外交政策，曾在维护世界和平和保障各国安全方面，不断地作出巨大的贡献。最近两年来，苏联和全世界的和平力量为和缓国际紧张局势和保卫世界和平所作的不懈努力，更产生了积极的结果。谁都知道，苏联、中国和全世界爱好和平的力量曾经促成了一九五三年的朝鲜停战和一九五四年印度支那和平的恢复，从而导致了国际局势的某些和缓。但是由于“冷战”制造者重新武装西德和把西德拉入西方军事集团的巴黎协定的签订，由于马尼拉侵略性军事联盟的建立，国际关系的紧张局势的和缓重新遇到重大的障碍。在这种情况下，苏联和全世界爱好和平的力量又采取了一系列的正确的措施。在远东方面，苏联积极地支持万隆亚非会议的决议，并支持我国政府所提出的中美两国直接谈判的建议。在欧洲方面，面对着由于巴黎协定所产生的来自西方国家的严重威胁，以苏联为首的欧洲八国在华沙签订了友好合作互助条约，这对于维护欧洲和世界和平起了重大的作用。接着，在今年五月，苏联政府提出了关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器、氢武器以及消灭战争威胁的新建议。苏联政府并且促成了签订奥地利国家条约。这个条约，不仅使奥地利完全恢复独立和走上和平发展的道路，而且由于奥地利走上中立的道路，对于欧洲整个政治局势发生了良好的影响，大有助于国际紧张局势的和缓。今年五月底和六月初，苏联政府代表团又访问南斯拉夫，改善了苏南关系，对于欧洲和世界和平事业再一次作出巨大的贡献。苏联和印度两国政府首脑发表联合声明，表明了苏联和印度这两个大国，对于世界和平的迫切问题态度的一致，表明了苏印两国人民之间的友谊和合作正日益巩固和发展。由于苏联这一系列的积极步骤和全世界和平力量的努力，促成了今年七月间日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的召开。这个会议产生了用和平协商办法解决国际争端的“日内瓦精神”，促进了国际紧张局势的进一步和缓。
    最近两三个月来，苏联又采取了许多实际的步骤，来实现这种“日内瓦精神”，并且受到了一切爱好和平人民的支持。苏联主动地同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系，苏联和德意志民主共和国关系条约已经缔结，并且已经生效。苏联同存在于德国领土上的两个国家之间的正常关系，无疑地将有助于和缓欧洲中心地带的国际紧张局势，并且对解决德国问题有良好的影响。在日内瓦会议以后，苏联就裁减武装部队六十四万人，同时，苏联在苏芬谈判中主动提出在规定的期限以前放弃在芬兰领土上的波卡拉半岛海军基地。苏联的这些步骤，不但进一步加强了同有关国家的友好关系，而且受到世界各国舆论的赞许。此外，苏联在积极争取禁止原子武器和氢武器的同时，还对于和平利用原子能的国际合作采取了积极的态度，作了巨大的贡献。苏联还积极地扩大同其他国家各界人士的接触，从各方面增进国与国间的联系和谅解。苏联的这些努力，使协商和合作的精神在国际关系中的影响日益扩大。目前国际和平力量正在继续发展，苏联、中国和其他爱好和平的国家所主张的谋求国际谅解、互相信任和发展国际友好关系，已经成为世界大多数国家和具有各种不同信仰与不同思想的广大人民的一致呼声。各国人民都坚决要求现在正在举行的四国外长会议遵循“日内瓦精神”前进，对国际和平与安全的事业作出具体的贡献。全世界团结在争取和平斗争中的各国人民，今天比任何时候都更有信心和决心，更加懂得：如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业坚持到底，和平就能够保持和巩固！
    但是，并不是所有的国家都以实际行动表现了和缓国际紧张局势与谋求世界和平的诚意。通往世界和平和国际合作的道路并不是平坦的。美国的一些认为只有在紧张局势当中才能获得利益的势力，早已把“日内瓦精神”当作是他们的“灾难”了。美国的一些有势力人物不断发表反对“日内瓦精神”的演说，他们仍然以为可能凭借“实力地位”政策来达到他们的目的。甚至有些和平的最顽固的敌人，还要求继续“冷战”，他们努力使人们相信，
  “日内瓦精神”已经消失或者正在消失之中。在这种情形下，我们决不能放松警惕，我们必须对和平敌人的阴谋百倍地提高警惕，准备对它作长期的、反复的斗争。全世界的和平战士们，正在世界和平伟大旗手——苏联的引导下，结成一条和平保卫者反对战争集团的强大的阵线，并且日益吸引更广大的人民群众参加这个阵线。我们中国人民，永远是和伟大的苏联人民团结一致的。过去几年来的事实，完全证明了毛泽东主席的话：“中苏两国强大的同盟是不可战胜的力量，是反对帝国主义侵略和维护远东和平及安全的坚强保证，也是争取世界和平的伟大事业胜利的保证”，中苏两国坚如磐石的友好团结。中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和合作，永远是保卫远东和世界和平的强大因素！
    同志们，朋友们！我们在庆祝十月革命节三十八周年纪念的时候，特别感到高兴，因为今年是苏联第五个五年计划胜利完成的一年。在这个伟大的节日前夕，光荣的苏联人民正以忘我的劳动，为着胜利完成和全面超额完成第五个五年计划而斗争，并且为着迎接即将到来的苏联共产党第二十次代表大会而展开着规模巨大的社会主义劳动竞赛。苏联第五个五年计划是为了把苏联进一步由社会主义推向共产主义而作出的规模宏伟的建设计划。第五个五年计划在工业方面的生产指标，早在今年五月一日以前就已经提前完成，也就是以四年零四个月的时间完成了。一九五五年苏联的工业生产水平比战前增加了两倍多。苏联人民遵循着伟大的列宁的教导，努力贯彻执行苏联共产党所一贯坚持的优先发展重工业的方针。因此，生产资料的生产到一九五五年底将比一九五○年至少增加百分之八十四，已占苏联工业总产量百分之七十以上。苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下，正在采取各种措施来大大增加农业的产量，规定在最近几年内作到谷物的年产量至少要增加到一百亿普特，畜产品增加到两倍到两倍以上。在最近两年中，苏联就已经开垦了二千多万公顷荒地，并在两千多万公顷土地上播了种。今年苏联的农业又获得了大丰收。随着工农业生产的迅速提高，苏联人民的物质和文化生活也在不断提高。今年苏联消费品的生产水平比一九五○年提高百分之七十二，这个数目，已大大超过第五个五年计划原来规定提高百分之六十五的规定。苏联的文化和科学正以惊人的速度走向人类文明的新高峰。
    苏联第五个五年计划的完成是苏联人民为了把自己的国家推向共产主义的斗争中的一个伟大的胜利。这个胜利不仅进一步加强了苏联的经济力量和国防力量，而且大大增强了团结一致的和平民主阵营的力量。这是苏联对于世界和平的又一个巨大的贡献。全世界进步人类都在为苏联人民的这一伟大胜利而欢欣鼓舞。我们中国人民，对于我们伟大盟邦苏联的这一伟大胜利，特别感到高兴。
    中国人民建设社会主义的斗争，跟苏联人民建设自己的国家一样，是以马克思列宁主义的理论为指导方针的，是以苏联建设社会主义的实践为榜样的，同时又是在苏联政府和人民伟大无私的帮助下进行的。苏联建设社会主义的伟大成就和对于我国兄弟般的无私的援助，对于我们取得建设社会主义的胜利，是极其重要的有利条件。
    苏联建设社会主义的经验证明：建设社会主义的经济基础，必须贯彻优先发展重工业的方针，在重工业的基础上建立社会主义的大工业体系；必须把农业包括在内的国民经济转移到大生产的技术基础上来，也就是必须首先把分散经营的个体农民组织到集体经营的农业生产合作社里面来；必须把包括多种经济成分的国民经济改变为单一的社会主义经济，积极地发展社会主义经济成分，利用、限制、改造非社会主义的经济成分；必须把文化革命和社会主义文化建设当作一个重要任务，把社会主义建设和提高劳动人民的文化水平直接地联系起来。毫无疑问，这些宝贵的经验，对于正在建设社会主义的中国人民是特别重要的。中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下，已经并且将要继续根据中国的具体情况和特点，正确地运用这些宝贵的经验。毛泽东主席在一九五二年指出：从中华人民共和国成立到社会主义建成，这是一个过渡时期，党在过渡时期的总路线，是逐步实现社会主义工业化，逐步完成对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。这个总路线，已经作为国家在过渡时期的总任务，在一九五四年列入了中华人民共和国宪法。根据这个总任务，我们已经制定了并且正在实行着伟大的发展国民经济的第一个五年计划。最近，毛泽东主席发表的“关于农业合作化问题”的具有重大历史意义的著作，以及中国共产党七届六中全会（扩大）所作出的在全国范围内积极地发展农业生产合作社，逐步地实现农业合作化的有关决议，保证了全国大部分地区将有可能在一九五八年基本上完成半社会主义性质的合作化；这就为进一步完成农业的社会主义改造，打下良好的基础。关于在过渡时期内逐步削弱直到消灭资本主义经济成分的问题，我们也已经制定并且实行对私营工商业的利用、限制和改造的政策；最近毛泽东主席在全国工商界座谈会上所作的有关指示，更是进一步贯彻执行这一政策的重要保证。我们在文化建设方面，也正学习着苏联社会主义文化的范例，实行着巨大规模的社会主义文化建设计划；在这一方面，正在进行并且将继续展开的宣传唯物主义、批判资产阶级唯心主义的运动，对于我国社会主义建设，具有特别重大的意义。所有这一切，都令人信服地证明了这个真理：有了苏联建设社会主义的经验作借鉴，有了中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导，我们中国人民的建设社会主义的伟大工程，必能取得彻底的胜利；必能像苏联一样，在我们伟大祖国的土地上，建立起巩固的、繁荣富强的社会主义社会。
    我们之所以一定会获得胜利，不仅因为我们有苏联的经验作为榜样，而且因为我们得到了苏联政府和苏联人民的伟大的无私的援助。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，苏联就不断地通过贷款、贸易、派遣专家、供应设备等各种方式，对我国经济的恢复工作，给予了重大的援助。一九五三年我国进入第一个五年计划建设时期以后，中苏两国的经济合作更获得了全面的发展，苏联对我国经济建设的无私的援助是更加全面和系统了。第一个五年计划的中心是工业建设，而工业建设的中心又是在苏联援助下的一五六个单位的建设。一五六个单位包括现代化的钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿企业、石油企业、各种重型机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、飞机制造厂、电力站、化学工厂等，这些项目是我国第一个五年计划中新建和扩建的二千九百九十四个工业建设单位中的骨干，有人把它们叫做我国工业化的“命根子”，这是完全正确的。这些建设单位的技术是非常复杂的，因而从勘察地质，选择厂址，搜集设计基础资料，进行设计，供应设备，指导建筑安装和开工，供应新产品的技术资料，直到制成新产品，从头到尾都是由苏联给以全面援助。这些单位是用现代最新的技术装备起来的，它们的百分之五十到七十的主要设备都由苏联供应。管理这些现代化企业需要高度的技术水平，为了使我们能够掌握这些新企业，又由苏联派来大批专家，同时接受这些企业中的工人和技术人员到苏联去学习和实习。一五六个建设单位是苏联对我国第一个五年计划援助的最重要的一方面。除此以外，在国民经济建设和文化建设的各部门，例如：农业、水利、林业、铁路、交通、邮电、建筑、地质、文化、教育、科学、卫生等等各个方面，我们都得到苏联广泛的多方面的援助。特别值得提起的，是苏联在和平利用原子能方面给予我国以技术和工业上的援助。苏联已计划为我国建立一个发热量达六千五百瓩的实验性原子堆，在必要情况下发热量将能提高到一万瓩。这将使我国在短时期内就可能掌握世界最先进的原子能科学技术。可以想见，在不久的将来，原子能就能为我国的和平建设事业服务。
    苏联对我国的这种伟大的、长期的、全面的、无私的援助，这在国际关系史上是从来没有过的伟大创举。苏联对我国的援助，是完全新型的兄弟般的合作关系的体现，正如斯大林所说，是建立在“互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望”的基础上面的。这种合作不仅有利于我们两个国家的繁荣和进步，而且也极其有利于世界和平和全人类的幸福。我们全中国人民以无可言喻的感激的心情，对伟大盟邦苏联和伟大的苏联人民给予我们中国人民的这种援助，表示最真诚的感谢！
    同志们，朋友们！中苏两国的永远牢不可破的友谊，乃是我们过去的、现在的和将来的胜利的保证。全国人民都懂得必须像爱护自己眼珠一样地来保卫这个最伟大的友谊。我们要尽一切努力来进一步地巩固和发展中苏两国人民之间的深厚友谊，要更加努力地学习苏联人民的榜样，把我们伟大的祖国建设成为一个繁荣富强、光辉灿烂的社会主义国家。我们永远同苏联在一起，为伟大的社会主义事业和世界和平事业而奋斗。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年万岁！
    世界和平的坚强堡垒、我国建设社会主义的榜样——伟大的苏联万岁！
    世界和平的强大因素——中苏两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和合作万岁！
