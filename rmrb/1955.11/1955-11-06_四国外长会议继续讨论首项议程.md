Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 5th: The conference of the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States continued its discussion of the first agenda item – European security and the German question – on November 4th. The meeting was chaired by Molotov.

Dulles spoke first. Dulles portrayed the proposals put forward by the three Western powers as conforming to the instructions of the heads of government of the four powers, while insisting that the Soviet proposals on European security did not conform to these instructions. He said that the new Soviet proposals of October 31 were closer to the proposals of the Western countries, but that there were still fundamental and serious differences. According to Dulles, the difference lay in the fact that the Western countries proposed the restoration of German unity, while the Soviet Union proposed the division of Germany. Dulles said that there was a considerable degree of consensus between the two sides on the issue of European security, but that it was truly difficult to reach a complete agreement until the two sides started from the same premise – the restoration of German unity.

When discussing the German question, Dulles described the Soviet proposal to establish all-German institutions as a statement declaring that the German people had been deprived of the opportunity to live in a unified country. He also said that the Soviet Union had not put forward any proposals on the reunification of Germany through free elections, and avoided discussing the proposals put forward by the Western countries on this issue.

Dulles said that the heads of government of the four countries had reached a consensus in July that had given the world new hope. Dulles said that the task of this conference was to implement those guarantees made in July and to reach certain agreements. The current work of the conference was a test. He expressed hope that the conference would successfully pass this test. He added that if no positive results were produced, it would not be due to the unwillingness of the Western delegations to fulfill the guarantees made in July.

Bineau then spoke. Bineau insisted that there was nothing new in the Soviet proposals on the German question and that they sought to fix the division of Germany. He advocated the Western countries' plan for holding elections in Germany. He said that if a decision was not made immediately that the German elections should be held no later than next year, the conference would not be able to complete its task.

Macmillan then spoke. Macmillan said he could not understand why the Soviet delegation was unwilling to agree to the Western countries' proposal for reunifying Germany through elections. Macmillan denied that the existence of two Germanys and two social systems was an obstacle to German reunification and insisted that West Germany had not been remilitarized. Macmillan then spoke about the "Eden Plan" proposed by the three Western powers on holding elections in Germany, and raised some questions to Molotov in this regard.

Molotov then spoke. Molotov said: On certain points related to the issue of European security, views have indeed converged. But on some major issues on which we should reach an agreement, there is still no consensus. That is the question of what measures we should agree on in order to ensure European security and to unify Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country.

Molotov then refuted the claim by the representatives of the Western countries that the Soviet proposals did not conform to the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries. He said: The Soviet government has not only consistently strived to implement the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries, but has also taken many measures to create a favorable international situation for resolving the problems facing the conference of foreign ministers. In this regard, Molotov mentioned that the Soviet Union had reduced its military by 640,000 troops and had prematurely abandoned the Soviet Union's only foreign military base – the Porkkala Peninsula naval base in Finland. Molotov also pointed out that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany showed the Soviet Union's desire to quickly resolve the German question, which would help eliminate the current abnormal state that still exists in Germany.

Molotov pointed out: At this conference, the three Western foreign ministers attempted to portray the viewpoint of placing the German question before the European security issue, a viewpoint that was not accepted by the heads of government of the four countries, as if it were reflected in the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries. The point of absorbing the representatives of the German people to participate in the discussion of the German question, which the heads of government of the four countries had attached great importance to, has not been able to reach an agreement.

Molotov also pointed out that the question raised by the Soviet delegation regarding the withdrawal of foreign troops from Germany in order to create more favorable conditions for the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany was evaded at the meeting, but the German people hoped that the meeting could make a positive decision on this issue.

Molotov then spoke about the all-German elections. He pointed out: The problem is that we are not simply discussing the issue of all-German elections. We are discussing a proposal from the three countries, in which the issue of all-German elections is only of subordinate significance. The three Western powers subordinate the issue of restoring German unity and all-German elections to the issue of a unified Germany joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, and these two organizations are directed against the Soviet Union. Can the Soviet Union or other peace-loving countries promote this matter? The answer is obvious. No.

Molotov said: Macmillan raised quite a few questions, but avoided talking about this main problem. Is such a proposal by the three Western countries in line with the national interests of the German people? No one has ever sought the opinion of the German people on this point. Does this conform to the interests of European security and the interests of those countries that are closely related to the issue of European security? No one has ever sought the opinion of these countries either.

Molotov also pointed out that the proposals of the three Western powers completely failed to mention the internal conditions that are conducive to uniting the two Germanys.

Molotov said: The proposals of the three countries seem to be put forward only as simple declarations. It gives the impression that the drafters of this draft knew in advance that their proposals, whether on the issue of European security or on the reunification of Germany through all-German elections, did not create a basis for reconciling our positions.

Molotov said that we propose to take another approach to solve the problem and take the first step towards German reunification. The proposal to establish an all-German committee is in line with this purpose.

After Molotov's speech, Dulles, on behalf of the governments of France, Britain, and the United States, put forward a proposal entitled "Reunifying Germany through Free Elections." This proposal stipulated:

1.  In September 1956, elections will be held throughout Germany to elect a National Assembly for all of Germany. This assembly will then draft a constitution and organize an all-German government based on the constitution.

2.  The four countries will each send one representative to form a committee, which, in consultation with German experts, will draft an election law and measures to ensure freedom and supervision of the elections.

3.  The committee will immediately begin to carry out its mission and submit a report to the four countries before January 1956.

Molotov stated that the Soviet delegation would study this proposal very carefully. At present, he intended to talk about preliminary opinions.

He pointed out that this was a proposal on the issue of restoring German unity, and the opinions of the Germans themselves should be sought. He expressed the hope that the opinions of the representatives of the two German states could be heard at the conference, and that an agreement could be reached on the issue of inviting representatives from the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic to participate in the discussion.

Molotov also pointed out that this proposal did not conform to the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries, because it was in no way linked to the fundamental task of ensuring European security. The Soviet delegation was prepared to express its views in detail after carefully studying this proposal.

The meeting ended there. The next meeting will be held on November 8th.

### 四国外长会议继续讨论首项议程

    四国外长会议继续讨论首项议程
    新华社五日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长会议十一月四日继续讨论第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题。会议由莫洛托夫担任主席。
    杜勒斯第一个发言。杜勒斯把西方三国提出的建议说成是符合四国政府首脑会议的指示的，而硬说苏联提出的关于欧洲安全的建议是不符合这个指示的。他说，苏联十月三十一日提出的关于欧洲安全的新建议比较接近西方国家的建议，但是仍旧有基本和严重的分歧，照杜勒斯说，分歧在于西方国家建议恢复德国统一，而苏联建议德国分裂。杜勒斯说，双方在欧洲安全的问题上存在着相当程度的一致意见，但是，在双方还没有从一个相同的前提——恢复德国的统一——出发之前，要取得完全的协议是真正困难的。
    杜勒斯在谈到德国问题的讨论时，把苏联关于建立全德机构的建议说成是宣布德国人民已经被剥夺了在一个统一的国家中生活的机会的声明。他还说苏联没有对通过自由选举重新统一德国的问题提出建议，回避讨论西方国家对这个问题提出的建议。
    杜勒斯说，四国政府首脑在七月间已经取得了使世界产生新希望的一致意见。杜勒斯说，这次会议的任务在于执行那些在今年七月间作出的保证，并且达成某些协议。目前会议的工作是一种考验。他表示希望会议会顺利地通过这种考验。他又说，如果不产生积极的结果，并不是由于西方国家代表团不愿意实现七月间的保证。
    随后由比内发言。比内硬说苏联关于德国问题的建议中没有任何新的东西，而是要固定德国的分裂。他鼓吹西方国家的关于在德国举行选举的计划。他说，如果不立刻决定德国的选举不能迟于明年举行，这次会议就不能完成任务。
    麦克米伦接着发言。麦克米伦说，他不能理解苏联代表团为什么不愿意同意西方国家关于通过选举重新统一德国的建议。麦克米伦否认两个德国和两种社会制度的存在是德国重新统一的障碍，并且硬说西德并没有重新军国主义化。麦克米伦然后谈到西方三国提出的、关于在德国举行选举的“艾登计划”，并且在这方面向莫洛托夫提出了一些问题。
    随后由莫洛托夫发言。莫洛托夫说：在涉及欧洲安全问题的某些点上，观点的确已经有了接近。但是在一些我们应当达成协议的主要问题上还没有取得一致的意见，这就是：为了保障欧洲安全和把德国统一成为爱好和平的、民主的国家，我们之间想就怎样的措施取得一致意见的问题。
    莫洛托夫接着驳斥了西方国家的代表说什么苏联的建议不符合四国政府首脑的指示的说法。他说：苏联政府不仅一贯努力执行四国政府首脑的指示，而且还采取了许多措施以便为解决外交部长会议面临的问题创造有利的国际局势。在这方面，莫洛托夫提到，苏联已经裁军六十四万人，并且提前放弃了苏联在国外的唯一军事基地——芬兰波卡拉半岛海军基地。莫洛托夫还指出，苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系，这表明苏联力求迅速解决德国问题的愿望，这有助于消除目前在德国还存在的不正常状态。
    莫洛托夫指出：在这次会议上，西方三国外交部长企图把那种没有为四国政府首脑接受的、把德国问题放在欧洲安全问题之前的观点，说成似乎是在四国政府首脑指示中得到反映的观点。四国政府首脑曾经非常重视的关于吸收德国人民的代表参加讨论德国问题这一点，目前却没有能够达成协议。
    莫洛托夫还指出：会上回避了苏联代表团提出的关于从德国撤出外国军队以便为德国两部分的接近创造更有利的条件的问题，可是德国人民却希望会议能够就这个问题作出积极的决定。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到全德选举问题。他指出：问题在于我们不是单纯地讨论全德选举问题。我们在讨论三国的一个建议，在这个建议中，全德选举问题只是具有从属的意义。西方三国把恢复德国统一和全德选举的问题从属于统一后的德国加入北大西洋公约和西欧联盟的问题，而这两个组织是针对苏联的。苏联或者其他爱好和平的国家能够促进这件事吗？答复是明显的。不能。
    莫洛托夫说：麦克米伦提出了相当多的问题，却避而不谈这个主要问题。难道西方三国这样的建议是符合德国人民的民族利益吗？从来没有人就这一点征求过德国人民的意见。难道这符合全欧安全的利益和那些同全欧安全问题有切身关系的国家的利益吗？也从来没有人征求过这些国家的意见。
    莫洛托夫还指出：西方三国的建议中完全没有提到符合于把两个德国统一起来这个任务的内部条件。
    莫洛托夫说：三国的建议看来只是作为简单的宣言而提出来的。它给人以这样的印象：这个草案的拟订人事先就知道，他们的建议无论是在欧洲安全问题上，还是在德国问题上，在用全德选举的办法求得德国重新统一上，都没有造成使我们的立场一致起来的基础。
    莫洛托夫说，我们建议采取另外一种办法来解决问题，并且向德国重新统一的道路上迈开第一步。关于建立全德委员会的建议就是符合于这种目的的。
    在莫洛托夫发言后，杜勒斯代表法、英、美三国政府提出一项名为“通过自由选举重新统一德国”的建议。这个建议规定：
    一、一九五六年九月在全德举行选举，选出全德国民议会，然后由这个议会制定宪法草案，并且根据宪法组织全德政府。
    二、四国各派代表一人组成委员会，在同德国专家磋商下，草拟选举法以及关于保证选举自由和监督的措施。
    三、委员会立即开始执行自己的使命，并且在一九五六年一月以前向四国提出报告。
    莫洛托夫表示：苏联代表团将非常仔细地研究这个建议。目前他打算谈谈初步意见。
    他指出：这是一个关于恢复德国统一问题的建议，应该征求德国人自己的意见。他表示希望，在会议上听取两个德意志国家的代表的意见，并且希望能够就邀请德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国的代表参加讨论的问题达成协议。
    莫洛托夫还指出：这个建议不符合于四国政府首脑的指示，因为这个建议丝毫没有同保障欧洲安全的基本任务联系起来。苏联代表团准备在对这个建议仔细研究之后再详细地表示自己的看法。
    会议到此结束。下次会议将在十一月八日举行。
