　　Life on the Virgin Lands
　　“Krasnodar” State Farm Tractor Brigade Leader in the Altai Territory, Soviet Union, Ge·Kovalevsky
    In the vast fields of Siberia and Kazakhstan, stretch fertile, uncultivated grasslands that have remained untouched for centuries. The Communist Party calls on the Soviet people to reclaim these barren lands in the shortest possible time, so that they may bring rich gifts to mankind.
    Tens of thousands of young men and women in our country responded to the call of our beloved Communist Party. They decided to take part in the arduous task of reclaiming virgin and fallow lands.
    I was a machine operator at the “Stalin” State Farm in the Kurganinsk District of the Krasnodar Territory, and I also expressed my desire to go to Altai along with other patriotic volunteers. We arrived on the grasslands in early spring. The surroundings were plains covered with short artemisia and the stiff awns of feather grass. Only in the distance did the majestic peaks of the Altai Mountains appear in the sunlit fields.
    On a cold March morning, the first canvas tents of the newcomers were set up on the grasslands. A few days later, the sound of tractors echoed across the vast plains. They were building roads. Along this road walked the ranks of volunteer builders of the newly arrived state-owned grain farms on the virgin lands. Bunkhouses, field kitchens, and prefabricated house parts were transported to the grasslands along with them.
    In the initial days, the newly built state farm received dozens of high-horsepower tractors, including various brands such as "C-80" and "ДТ-54", which, calculated at fifteen horsepower per unit, was equivalent to two hundred and twenty-two tractors. In addition, they received twelve trucks, eight tankers, three cars, four automatic engineering vehicles, and many various types of farming implements. Before the harvest, they also received seventy combine harvesters and grain cleaning machines.
    More than four hundred people came to build the state farm. Among them were workers from industrial enterprises, office staff from cities across the country, and agricultural machine operators. Cadres were quickly selected, tractor brigades and construction brigades were formed, and people's daily lives were initially arranged. Many difficulties were encountered at the beginning, but they were all overcome smoothly. The great task put forward by the Communist Party and the Soviet government in expanding grain production generated unprecedented energy and enthusiasm among the newcomers.
    Our tractor brigade consisted of thirty-five young newcomers. We were assigned eight tractors and towed farm implements. In early April, we went to the grasslands dozens of kilometers away from the central administration of the state farm. We were eager to start reclaiming the wasteland as soon as possible, but the land was still frozen.
    The machine operators were busy arranging their daily lives. Tents were set up, a dining hall was built, and tables, chairs, washbasin stands, and cooking utensils were made. At the unanimous suggestion, the caring and meticulous girl and Communist Youth League member, Lydia Radikova, became the cook. She made delicious breakfasts and lunches, especially demonstrating her culinary skills in preparing game, which was caught by our hunting enthusiasts.
    Not a day was interrupted from studying in our team. Long before going to the fields, machine operators read all the books they could find about land reclamation. They especially carefully studied the experiences of the nationally renowned Altai machine operators and Socialist Labor Heroes S. Pyatnitsky, F. Chabanov, P. Gubin, and others.
    We understood the soil quality and terrain of the large area of land assigned to us, and studied the density of the sod. At Communist Youth League member meetings and plenary meetings, the posts and responsibilities of each member were precisely defined. The people in our team were all people who loved labor and had initiative.
    The tractor brigade solemnly and jubilantly welcomed the day when they began to reclaim the wasteland. People will never forget the first furrow. How delighted it made the young men and women! Indeed, how could people not be happy! You know, the cause of conquering the grasslands had begun; we thought that soon, this place, which now only grows feather grass, would resound with the sound of a sea of wheat, and a huge torrent of grain would pour into the granary of our beloved Soviet country.
    We quickly began plowing the land. This was not an easy task. The layers of wasteland were so hard, tightly sewn together by the roots of plants, that even modern and abundant technology could not immediately make them submit to cultivation. The plows were often damaged. They had to straighten the plowshares almost every day.
    People demonstrated creative initiative and accelerated the pace of work. For each machine operator, it was important to maximize the output of the tractor and not let the machine wear out quickly. The older comrades set an example of skillful use of machinery.
    Our team was mainly composed of young machine operators who were mastering the steering wheel of the tractor for the first time. However, there were also a few newcomers in our team who already had experience in agricultural work. These were Anatoly Alexandrovich Yermak and Pavel Fadeevich Maznichin, who had been machine operators in Kuban. They undertook the obligation to voluntarily help the young tractor drivers, teaching them their experience, telling them the structure of the most complex parts of the machine, and pointing out how to take care of the tractor. The earnest cooperation of the young tractor drivers with the experienced agricultural machine operators ensured the uninterrupted operation of all the machines.
    The weather in Altai in spring is fickle. Sunny days can suddenly turn into rainy days, and it often snows. The wind on the grasslands turns into a storm on rainy days. In the first spring when we came to the grasslands, when we had not yet settled down properly, it was generally not easy to live on the grasslands. The roofs of the campsites leaked. Storms tore the tents, but the newcomers were not discouraged.
    "Nature is training us, and we will soon no longer be newcomers, but old residents," the machine operators said.
    People overcame difficulties and established meritorious services. The work of tractor drivers Belanov, Kurochkin, Maznichin, Shandaliyev, and many others, who each plowed not six or seven hectares per shift as required by the quota, but thirteen or fourteen hectares, can be said to be precisely like this.
    Work was divided into two shifts and carried out day and night without sparing any effort. The first achievement of the tractor brigade made each of us very happy, gave us new strength, and encouraged us. Twelve days of intense days passed, and our tractor brigade was already able to report to the management of the state farm: 1,420 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed. All of these lands were sown with grain crops, mainly the most valuable grain crop - spring wheat. This was completed in a short period of time, with good quality, and widely adopted advanced agronomic methods - cross-narrow row sowing.
    This is gratifying news: the entire staff of the state farm exceeded the plan for plowing the wasteland, reclaimed more than 19,000 hectares of new land and sowed it with grain crops. This is the first victory, a true festival for the newcomers.
    It has only been two months since the first envoys of the Soviet people planted the signs determining the boundaries of the future "Krasnodar" State Farm in this uninhabited grassland. Neat wheat seedlings have already appeared on the boundless fields.
    The day after sowing was completed, the sound of tractors rang out again. They drove further and further into the grasslands. The machine operators were preparing the land for sowing next year. And on the construction site of the central management office of the state farm (where stacks of prefabricated house parts, timber, bricks, and roofing materials had previously stood tall), a heated competition unfolded to build cultural, living, and production buildings as quickly as possible.
    The state farm received a lot of funds and necessary building materials from the state, but there were not enough skilled construction cadres, so the young people declared: Build it ourselves! Our tractor brigade was divided into two groups: one group of twelve people continued to reclaim the land and take care of the crops; and the other group of twenty-three people engaged in the construction work of the state farm village. Thus, the young tractor drivers, towed implement operators, and car drivers, even those who had never touched woodworking tools, became builders. They quickly mastered the specialized techniques of carpentry, joinery, bricklaying, roofing, plastering, and glass installation.
    In one summer, a new town grew up on the distant grasslands: here there are several streets composed of well-equipped multi-residential houses, workshops, warehouses, shops and dining halls.
    Construction work continues. There are still many things to be built: standard repair shops, garages, granaries, livestock buildings (in the near future, our farm will also operate animal husbandry), public bathhouses, bakeries, dining rooms, clubs, ten-year schools, children's institutions, and hundreds of residences.
    The heat and wind of the Altai summer are rare. On the grasslands, dry hot winds blow continuously day and night for days on end, sucking up the moisture from the soil, and no matter how much we expect rain, it never falls. But the entire staff of the farm believes that the wasteland will not let us down.
    The harvest season has arrived. The crops are short. If harvested at the usual height, many ears would be left in the field, so it was necessary to harvest as if "shaving" the land. However, even under such conditions, combine operator Yakov Ryabalov still completed two quotas every day. P. Kurochkin also worked very hard, just like during the sowing period. He quickly mastered the profession that was still new to him and confidently operated the steering wheel of the combine. This young machine operator also exceeded his production task by a multiple.
    Along the village roads and highways, cars full of grain are running day and night. This state farm, which was only established for half a year (we jokingly call it a "baby"), sent the first batch of grain to the state from the wasteland. Our "baby" sent a lot of grain! Our tractor brigade alone gave the state two trains - more than a hundred cars of grain!
    Our state farm harvested one million poods of grain from the wasteland in its first year.
    In the evening, after the working day is over and a summary has been made, the young people take a cultural break. Some people are reading books (there are many books in our team, just like in the state farm), others are writing letters to friends, and others are gathered around the radio listening to the broadcasts of beloved Moscow. Athletes are competing in agility and endurance, and hunters always do what they love. There are also times when the whole team goes to the grasslands, and at this time, the sounds of accordions, majestic couplet songs, or singing while dancing in a ring dance fill the twilight air.
    The material welfare of the workers is constantly improving. Many machine operators have well-furnished, comfortable, and separate residences. Wages have increased. For example, the tractor drivers in our team earn an average of one thousand two hundred to one thousand four hundred rubles per month. In addition, during the harvest season, they can each receive seven to ten quintals of grain. Many people have acquired personal belongings. For example, I have a dairy cow, two pigs, and poultry. My income is good, I bought a lot of valuable furniture, and I also bought a motorized bicycle.
    The friendly family of newcomers is constantly being enriched. Relatives and friends come to the machine operators, and demobilized soldiers come to the state farm to settle down for a long time. Everyone who comes to the wasteland quickly becomes familiar with the new place and finds that there are all conditions here to work successfully and live well.

　　荒地上的生活
　　苏联阿尔泰边疆区荒地上的“克拉斯诺达”
　　国营农场拖拉机工作队队长　格·科瓦列夫斯基
    在西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的广阔原野上，伸展着肥沃的未开垦的草原，很多世纪以来没有人触动过它们。共产党号召苏联人在最短时期内把这些荒芜的土地开垦出来，使它们给人类带来丰富的礼物。
    我国数万男女青年响应了亲爱的共产党的号召。他们决定参加开垦生荒地和熟荒地的艰巨事业。
    我曾是克拉斯诺达尔边疆区库尔加宁斯克区“斯大林”国营农场的机器操使者，也同其他爱国者——志愿者一起表示了到阿尔泰来的愿望。我们是在早春来到草原上的。四周是平原，上面覆盖着矮小的艾蒿，以及羽茅草的坚硬的刺毛。只是在远方，阿尔泰山的巍峨的峰峦出现在阳光照耀的原野上。
    在一个寒冷的三月的清晨，新来者的第一个帆布帐篷在草原上搭起了。过了几天，辽阔的草原上传出了拖拉机的响声。他们在修筑道路。沿着这条路，走着新到荒地上的国营谷物农场志愿建设者的队伍。宿营车、行军灶、装配房屋的配件，都同他们一起送到草原上来了。
    还在最初几天，新建的国营农场就得到了数十台大马力的拖拉机，其中有“C—八○”、“ДТ—五四”等各种不同的牌号，如以每台十五马力计算，这就等于是二百二十二台拖拉机。此外，还收到了十二部载重汽车、八部油槽车、三部小汽车、四部自动工程车、许多各种各样的耕作工具。在收获以前，还收到了七十台收割联合机和清谷机。
    前来建设国营农场的有四百多人。其中有工业企业的工人，从全国各城市来的机关职员，农业机器操使者。干部很快地挑选出来了，拖拉机工作队和建筑工作队组成了，人们的日常生活已经作了初步的安排。起初遇到了不少困难，但都顺利地克服了。共产党和苏联政府在扩大谷物生产方面提出的伟大任务，使新来者产生了空前未有的精力和热情。
    我们的拖拉机工作队由三十五个年轻的新来者组成。有八台拖拉机和牵引式农具归我们使用。四月初我们到远离国营农场中央管理处数十公里的草原上去。我们极想赶快着手开垦荒地，但是土地还冻着。
    机器操使者们忙着安排日常生活。搭起了帐篷，建起了食堂，制成了桌椅板凳、洗脸盆架和炊具。根据全体一致的建议，对人关切而做事细心的姑娘、共青团员丽吉雅·拉季科娃当了厨师。她把早餐和中餐做得味美可口，在调制野味方面特别表现了她的烹饪技术。这些野味是我们的狩猎爱好者捕获的。
    在我们队里，一天也没有中断过学习。早在到地里去以前，机器操使者们就阅读了所有能够找到的关于垦荒的书籍。特别仔细地研究了名闻全国的阿尔泰的机器操使者、社会主义劳动英雄斯·皮雅特尼茨、符·恰巴诺夫、普·古宾等同志的经验。
    我们了解了分配给我们的大片土地的土质和地势，研究了草根土的密度。在共青团员会议和全体会议上，精确地规定了每个队员的岗位和职责。我们队里的人都是热爱劳动和有主动精神的人。
    拖拉机工作队隆重地、兴高采烈地迎接了开始垦荒的日子。人们永远不会忘记第一道犁沟。它使男女青年们多么欢欣鼓舞啊。的确，怎样能使人不高兴呢！要知道，征服草原的事业开始了；我们想，不久以后，现在只长羽茅草的这块地方，将喧响着小麦的海洋的声浪，谷物的巨流将注入亲爱的苏维埃国家的粮仓。
    我们很快就开始耕地。这件事不是轻而易举的。荒地的地层这样坚硬，被植物的根密密地缝起来，甚至现代的丰富技术也不能使它们马上向耕耘屈服。犁常常被损坏。他们差不多每天都要把犁头打直。
    人们表现了创造的主动精神，加快了工作的速度。对于每个机器操使者说来，使拖拉机达到最高的工作量，并且不要让机器很快磨损，是很重要的。年长的同志作出了善于使用机器的榜样。
    我们这一队主要是由一些初次掌握拖拉机方向盘的年轻的机器操使者组成的。但是在我们队里也有几个已经具有农业工作经验的新来者。这是曾在库班当机器操使者的阿纳托里·亚历山大罗维奇·叶尔玛克和巴维尔·法捷耶维奇·马兹尼钦。他们承担了自愿帮助年轻的拖拉机手的义务，把自己的经验教给年轻的拖拉机手，告诉他们机器的最复杂部件的构造，指出应当怎样照管拖拉机。年轻的拖拉机手同有经验的农业机器操使者的认真的合作，保证了所有的机器都能不间断地工作。
    阿尔泰春天的天气是变幻无常的。大晴天会突然变成雨天，而且常常下雪。草原上的风在阴雨天就转变成暴风。在我们来到草原上的第一个春天，当我们还没有好好安顿下来的时候，一般说来，在草原上生活是不大容易的。野营的顶棚漏了。暴风雨撕裂了帐篷，可是新来者并没有气馁。
    “大自然在锻炼我们，我们很快就不再是新来者，而是老住户了。”机器操使者们说。
    人们克服了困难，建立了功绩。拖拉机手别拉诺夫、库罗奇金、马兹尼钦、山大里耶夫以及其他许多每班不是按定额垦荒六—七公顷而是垦荒十三—十四公顷的同志们的工作，可以说正是这样。
    工作分作两班，日日夜夜不遗余力地进行。拖拉机工作队取得的第一个成就使我们每个人都很高兴，给我们增加了新的力量，鼓舞了我们。十二天紧张的日子过去了，我们拖拉机工作队已经可以向国营农场的管理处报告：开垦了一千四百二十公顷荒地。这些地全都播种了谷类作物，主要是最珍贵的粮食作物——春小麦。这是在短短的时间内完成的，质量很好，广泛地采用了先进的农艺方法——十字窄行播种法。
    这是令人高兴的消息：国营农场的全体人员超额完成了翻耕荒地的计划，垦出了一万九千公顷以上的新土地并播种了谷类作物。这是第一个胜利，是新来者的真正的节日。
    自从苏联人民的第一批使者在这荒无人烟的草原上插上确定未来的“克拉斯诺达”国营农场边界的标志牌的时候起，总共才过了两个月。一望无际的田野上已经出现了齐整的小麦的幼苗。
    在播种完毕后的第二天，又响起了拖拉机的声音。它们越来越远地向草原驶去。机器操使者们在准备供来年播种的土地。而在国营农场中央管理处的建筑场上（这里在这以前已经高耸着一垛垛的装配房屋配件、木料、砖石和屋顶），展开了争取最快地建好文化——生活和生产建筑物的热烈的竞赛。
    国营农场从国家得到了许多资金和必要的建筑材料，但是熟练的建筑干部不够，青年们宣称：自己动手建设！我们拖拉机工作队分成两个小组：一组十二人，继续垦荒和照顾庄稼；另一组二十三人，从事国营农场村的建设工作。于是年轻的拖拉机手、牵引农具手、汽车司机，连那些从未摸过细木工用具的人，都成了建设者。他们很快就掌握了粗木工、细木工、砖瓦工、葺屋顶工、抹灰工、玻璃安装工的专门技术。
    一个夏天光景，在遥远的草原上成长了一座新的市镇：这里有几条由设备完善的多住宅的房屋组成的街道，有作坊、仓库、商店和食堂。
    建设工作在继续进行。还应当建筑许多东西：标准修理厂、汽车库、粮仓、畜牧业建筑物（最近的将来我们农场也要经营畜牧业）、公共浴室、面包坊、餐室、俱乐部、十年制学校、儿童机关、成百所住宅。
    阿尔泰夏天的炎热和多风是罕见的。草原上，干燥的热风连续好几天昼夜不停地吹着，吸干了土壤中的水分，无论我们多么期望下雨，而雨总是不下。但是农场全体人员都相信，荒地是不会辜负我们的。
    收获期到来了。庄稼是矮生的。如果照通常的高度来收割，田里就会留下很多穗子，因此不得不简直像“剃刮”土地那样地来收割。但是，就是在这样的条件下，联合机手雅科夫·里亚巴洛夫还是每天完成两个定额。普·库罗奇金也像在播种时期那样非常努力。他很快就掌握了对他说来还是新的专业，确有把握地操纵着联合机的驾驶盘。这个年轻的机器操使者也超额一倍完成了生产任务。
    沿着村道和公路，日夜奔驰着装满谷物的汽车。这个成立只有半年的国营农场（我们在开玩笑时把它叫做“婴儿”），从荒地上给国家送出了第一批粮食。我们的“婴儿”送去的粮食很多！仅仅我们一个拖拉机工作队就给了国家两列货车——一百多车厢的谷物！
    我们的国营农场在第一年就从荒地上收了一百万普特谷物。
    晚上，当劳动日已经结束并作出总结以后，青年们进行文化休息。一些人在读书（在我们队里也像在国营农场里一样有很多书籍），另一些人在给朋友写信，还有些人聚集在收音机旁听亲爱的莫斯科的广播，运动员们在比赛机敏和耐久力，猎人也总是去干他们自己喜爱的事情。也有这样的时候：全队都到草原上去，这时，黄昏的空气里就洋溢着手风琴的声音、雄壮的对句歌曲或跳轮舞时的唱歌声。
    工人的物质福利状况在不断改善。许多机器操使者都有布置得很好的、舒适的、单独的住宅。工资提高了。例如，我们队里的拖拉机手平均每人每月收入一千二百到一千四百卢布。此外，在收获时期，他们每人还可以得到七公担到十公担的谷物。许多人都置起了个人的家当。例如我就有一头乳牛，两口猪，还有家禽。我的收入很好，我买了许多值钱的家具，还买了一部机器脚踏车。
    新来者的友爱的大家庭时时在充实着。亲戚、朋友们到机器操使者这里来，复员军人到国营农场来长期住下。每个到荒地上来的人都很快就同新地方搞熟了，发现这里有一切条件来顺利地工作和很好地生活。　　（本报特约稿）
