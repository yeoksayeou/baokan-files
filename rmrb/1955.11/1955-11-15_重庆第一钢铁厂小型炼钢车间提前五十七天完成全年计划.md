　　Chongqing No. 1 Steel Plant Small Steelmaking Workshop Completes Annual Plan 57 Days Ahead of Schedule

　　The small steelmaking workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company's No. 1 Steel Plant comprehensively fulfilled this year's national plan on November 4th, 57 days ahead of schedule. The quality of the steel has improved compared to last year, and the steelmaking cost has also been greatly reduced compared to last year. Now, the workers of this workshop are working hard to increase steel production by 11,000 tons for the country.

　　At the beginning of this year, the workers of the small steelmaking workshop promoted the advanced Soviet experiences of the "thick-layer sintering furnace bottom" and "rapid cold repair," greatly reducing the hot and cold repair time of open-hearth furnaces, and correspondingly improving the open-hearth furnace operation rate. In October, the time for sintering the furnace bottom in the small steelmaking workshop only accounted for 1.99 percent of the calendar time, which is already close to the advanced level of enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration. At the same time, because the medium repair time of open-hearth furnaces is shortened, 460 tons of steel can be produced additionally. Since the fourth quarter of this year, the small steelmaking workshop has also launched a rapid steelmaking competition. The melting time per furnace has generally been shortened compared to the past, and in October, a new record of smelting a furnace of steel in three hours and ten minutes was created. (Liu Yekang)

　　重庆第一钢铁厂小型炼钢车间提前五十七天完成全年计划
    重庆钢铁公司第一钢铁厂小型炼钢车间在十一月四日提前五十七天全面完成了今年的国家计划。钢的质量比去年提高，炼钢成本也比去年降低很多。现在这个车间的职工们正在努力争取为国家增产一万一千吨钢。
    小型炼钢车间的职工们在今年年初便推广了苏联“厚层烧结炉底”和“快速冷修”的先进经验，大大减少了平炉的热修和冷修时间，相应地提高了平炉作业率。小型炼钢车间十月份烧结炉底的时间只占日历时间的百分之一点九九，已经接近钢铁工业管理局所属企业的先进水平。同时由于平炉中修时间的缩短就可以增产四百六十吨钢。小型炼钢车间从今年第四季度起又开展了快速炼钢竞赛，每炉熔炼时间普遍都比过去缩短，十月份并创三小时十分炼一炉钢的最新纪录。　（刘瀹康）
