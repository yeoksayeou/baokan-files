　　Expanding International Cooperation in the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy
　　Cheng Guangrui
    From October 7th to 25th, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly discussed the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy. Representatives from various countries, in their speeches, all emphasized the necessity of broad international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and put forward opinions on the comprehensive development of such cooperation. They also pointed out the great significance of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva this August. On October 27th, the Political Committee passed the revised joint proposal of the United States, Britain, and other countries with a majority of fifty-three votes. No country voted against it in the vote (Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen abstained). The entire discussion process and the circumstances of this vote reflect the universal desire of the people of all countries: that atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes and that international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy should be widely developed.
    In the course of the discussion, the issue of establishing an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy became the center of debate. According to the provisions of the joint proposal of the United States, Britain, and other countries, the draft charter for the establishment of this agency should only be drafted by the eight so-called "sponsor countries" of the United States, Britain, and France, and then these so-called "sponsor countries" would invite other member states of the United Nations or member states of specialized agencies to participate in the so-called final drafting of the agency's charter. According to this plan, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, as well as other relevant countries, would be excluded from the work of drafting the charter of this important international agency. At the same time, the statement made by the U.S. representative at the meeting showed that the United States was also trying not to allow the United Nations organization to participate in the formulation of the agency's charter. The U.S. representative strongly defended the view that this agency should not be established within the framework of the United Nations, and that the relationship between this agency and the United Nations should only be equivalent to the relationship between the various specialized agencies and the United Nations. That is to say, this agency will not be subject to the control of the United Nations.
    The United States' attempt is very obvious, that is, it is trying its best to completely control the work of establishing an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the hands of the national group headed by the United States, so that they can enjoy a privileged position in this agency. The United States is afraid that the principle of great power unanimity in the Security Council will make its attempts impossible to realize, and, as American journalists have said, the United States' "button-pressing majority in the United Nations has ended," which is why the United States wants to place the future international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy outside the United Nations.
    This intentional proposition of the United States was opposed by the Soviet Union and many other countries. The Soviet representative pointed out in his speech that in the issue of establishing an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy, the principle that no country or group of countries can be in a privileged position must be adhered to. This agency should not become a tool in the hands of any country or group of countries to exert political or economic pressure on other countries. The Soviet representative advocated that the international agency should be established within the framework of the United Nations, and at the same time suggested convening a conference of experts from relevant countries to jointly study the problems arising from the drafting of the agency's charter. The Soviet representative also advocated that any country, even if it is not a member of the United Nations or a specialized agency of the United Nations, can participate in this agency. Representatives from many Asian, African, Latin American, and Nordic countries also emphasized in their speeches that both large and small countries should be able to participate in this agency on an equal basis, and advocated that this agency should have a close relationship with the United Nations. For example, the Indonesian representative argued: "This agency must actually be an integral part of our organization." Only in this way did the United States, Britain, and other countries have to stipulate in their amendments that Brazil, India, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia should join the United States, Britain, and other eight countries in the negotiations on the establishment of an international agency and the drafting of the agency's charter, and stipulate that the governments of these countries should submit reports to the United Nations General Assembly. As for the relationship between this agency and the United Nations, the proposal stipulates that it should be studied by the Secretary-General of the United Nations.
    As everyone knows, due to the obstruction of the United States, representatives from our country and the German Democratic Republic were unable to participate in the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy held in Geneva this August. This is extremely unreasonable. At the same time, in an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy that is related to the fate of the people of the world, it would be even more unreasonable if there were no representatives from the People's Republic of China, which has a population of 600 million, and other people's democratic countries. The Soviet delegation's proposal that any country that is willing to contribute to the common cause of the peaceful use of atomic energy can become a member of this international agency and participate in the next International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy is very reasonable. The Indian representative also reminded that we should avoid excluding countries like the People's Republic of China from the international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy. However, the amendments of the United States, Britain, and other countries still rejected the Soviet Union's proposal. This is an unfriendly and discriminatory step towards the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, and has nothing in common with the spirit of broad international cooperation in the United Nations Charter.
    Not only that, but to ensure broad and effective international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, atomic energy must only be used for peaceful purposes and not for war purposes. However, the proposals of the United States, Britain, and other countries avoid mentioning the fundamental issue of banning atomic weapons.
    Some North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries have this argument: it seems that when discussing the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy, if the issue of disarmament, that is, the issue of banning atomic weapons, is touched upon, it will disrupt the calmness of the discussion. This is a very strange argument, and its purpose is only to continue to expand armaments behind the smoke screen of the peaceful use of atomic energy. Facts have proved that what is disrupting the calmness of the discussion on the peaceful use of atomic energy is precisely the roar of American troops practicing atomic weapons in West Germany and Japan and the rumbling sound of American atomic cannons driving into Italian territory.
    Under the strong demands of all parties, the United States, Britain, and other countries had to add the following clause to their amendments: the General Assembly hopes to "vigorously promote the use of atomic energy only for the peaceful activities of mankind and to improve the living conditions of mankind." However, this amendment completely ignored the Soviet Union's proposal to call on all countries to continue their efforts to reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons. This shows that the United States and Britain still want to use some high-sounding tones to block the substantive issue of banning atomic weapons.
    After discussing the issue of the peaceful use of atomic energy, the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly began discussing the issue of atomic radiation effects from October 31st. The fact that this issue was put on the agenda reflects the concern of the people of all countries about the dangers caused by atomic weapons explosions and the desire to stop the use of atomic energy for military purposes. On November 9th, the Political Committee unanimously passed the establishment of a scientific committee to study the issue of atomic radiation effects. At the same time, despite the opposition of the United States and Britain, it still passed the amendment of Latin American countries to expand the membership of the scientific committee. The amendment proposed by the Soviet Union called on all countries to resolve the issue of the prohibition of nuclear weapons as soon as possible, and first of all, to reach an agreement on the cessation of all atomic weapons tests; and invited our country and Romania to participate in the scientific committee. This amendment was supported by India, Indonesia, and many other countries, but was vetoed by the majority gathered by the United States.
    The resolutions on the peaceful use of atomic energy and the study of atomic radiation effects adopted by the Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly to a certain extent represent a step forward for countries in promoting international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy. But it still lacks agreement on some important issues. The key issue remains: in order to develop more effective cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, international agreements must be reached on the most pressing issues of disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the easing of international tensions. In this regard, the Soviet delegation has put forward practical and feasible proposals. In view of the universal desire of the people, the United Nations General Assembly should discuss these issues on the basis of the proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, and enable the discussion to achieve positive results, so that the widespread development of international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy can truly be guaranteed.

　　扩大和平利用原子能的国际合作
　　程光锐
    从十月七日到二十五日，联合国大会政治委员会就和平利用原子能问题进行了讨论。各国代表在发言中都强调指出在和平利用原子能方面进行广泛的国际合作的必要，同时提出了全面发展这种合作的意见，他们并且都指出了今年八月在日内瓦召开的和平利用原子能国际会议的重大意义。十月二十七日，政治委员会以五十三票多数通过了修正后的美英等国的联合提案。在表决中没有一个国家投反对票（叙利亚、沙特阿拉伯、埃及、伊拉克、黎巴嫩和也门弃权）。整个讨论的过程和这次表决的情况都反映出各国人民的普遍愿望：把原子能只用于和平目的和应该广泛发展和平利用原子能的国际合作。
    在讨论的过程中，建立和平利用原子能国际机构问题成为辩论的中心。按照美英等国的联合提案的规定，关于建立这个机构的章程草案只应该由美、英、法等八个所谓“发起国”来草拟，然后再由这些所谓“发起国”，邀请联合国其他会员国或专门机构的会员国参加所谓最后拟订机构章程的会议。按照这个方案，苏联和人民民主国家以及其他有关国家就将被排斥在草拟这个重要的国际机构的章程草案的工作之外。同时，美国代表在会上的发言表明，美国也力图不让联合国组织参加机构章程的制定工作。美国代表极力维护这样一种意见：这个机构不应建立在联合国范围内，这个机构同联合国之间的关系只应该相当于各专门机构同联合国之间的关系。这就是说，这个机构将不受联合国的节制。
    美国的企图是非常明显的，那就是它尽力要想把建立和平利用原子能国际机构的工作完全把持在以美国为首的国家集团的手中，使它们在这个机构中享有特权地位。美国害怕安全理事会的大国一致原则将会使它的企图不能实现，而且，正如美国记者所说的，美国在“联合国中的按电钮的多数已经结束了”，这就是美国要把未来的和平利用原子能的国际机构放在联合国之外的缘故。
    美国的这种别有用心的主张，遭到了苏联和其他许多国家的反对。苏联代表在发言中指出，在建立和平利用原子能国际机构的问题上，必须本着没有一个国家或者国家集团可以处于特权地位的原则。这个机构不应该成为任何国家或国家集团手中对其他国家施加政治或经济压力的工具。苏联代表主张国际机构应该建立在联合国范围内，同时建议召开一次有关国家的专家会议来共同研究由于拟订机构章程而产生的问题。苏联代表并且主张，任何国家，即使它不是联合国或联合国专门机构的成员，都可以参加这个机构。许多亚非国家，拉丁美洲国家和北欧国家的代表在发言中也强调应该使大小国家都能够在平等的基础上参加这个机构，主张这个机构应该同联合国有密切的关系。例如，印度尼西亚代表就主张：“这个机构实际上必须是我们的组织的组成部分。”这样，美英等国才不得不在他们的修正案中规定邀请巴西、印度、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克同美英等八国一起参加关于建立国际机构和拟订机构章程的谈判，并规定这些国家的政府要向联合国大会提出报告。至于这个机构同联合国的关系，提案规定由联合国秘书长加以研究。
    大家知道，由于美国的阻挠，我国和德意志民主共和国的代表没有能够参加今年八月在日内瓦举行的和平利用原子能国际会议。这是极不合理的。同时，在关系全世界人民命运的和平利用原子能的国际机构中，如果没有拥有六亿人口的中华人民共和国以及其他人民民主国家的代表，将是更加不合理的事情。苏联代表团关于凡是愿意为和平利用原子能的共同事业作出贡献的国家都可以成为这个国际机构的会员国和参加下届和平利用原子能国际会议的建议是十分合理的。印度代表也提醒应该避免把像中华人民共和国这样的国家排斥在和平利用原子能国际机构以外的事情。然而，美英等国的修正案仍然拒绝了苏联的建议。这是对中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家的一种不友好和歧视的步骤，和联合国宪章的国际广泛合作的精神毫无共同之点。
    不仅如此，要保证在和平利用原子能方面进行广泛而有效的国际合作，就必须使原子能只能用于和平目的而不能用于战争目的。然而美英等国的提案对于像禁止原子武器这个根本性问题却避而不谈。
    某些北大西洋集团国家有这样一种论调：似乎在讨论和平利用原子能问题的时候，如果触及有关裁军的问题，也就是禁止原子武器问题，就会破坏讨论的平静。这是一种非常奇怪的论调，它的目的不过是要在和平利用原子能的烟幕后，继续扩张军备而已。事实证明，破坏讨论和平利用原子能问题的平静的，正是美国部队在西德和日本演习原子武器的轰响和美国原子大炮隆隆开进意大利国土的声音。
    在各方面的强烈要求下，美英等国在其修正案中不得不加上这样一条：大会希望“大力促进原子能只用于为人类的和平活动服务和改善人类的生活条件”。然而，这个修正案完全撇开了苏联关于呼吁各国继续努力达成禁止原子武器的建议。这说明美英国家还是想用一些堂皇的高调来挡开禁止原子武器这个实质问题。
    在讨论了和平利用原子能问题以后，联合国政治委员会又从十月三十一日起讨论了原子放射影响问题。这个问题提到议程上来，反映了各国人民对原子武器爆炸所产生的危害的关怀和要求停止原子能用于军事目的的愿望。政治委员会在十一月九日一致通过成立科学委员会来研究原子放射影响问题，同时，尽管美国和英国反对，仍然通过了拉丁美洲国家关于扩大科学委员会成员的修正案。苏联提出的修正案中号召各国早日解决禁止核子武器问题，首先，就停止一切原子武器试验达成协议；邀请我国和罗马尼亚参加科学委员会。这个修正案得到印度、印度尼西亚等许多国家的支持，但被美国所纠集的多数否决。
    联合国大会政治委员会通过的关于和平利用原子能和研究原子放射影响问题的决议在一定程度上表现了各国在促进和平利用原子能的国际合作的道路上前进了一步。但是它还缺少在一些重要问题上达成协议。关键的问题仍然在于：为了能够在和平利用原子能方面发展更有效的合作，必须就当前最迫切的裁军、禁止原子武器和缓和国际紧张局势的问题达成国际协议。在这一方面，苏联代表团已经提出了切实可行的建议。鉴于人民的普遍愿望，联合国大会应该以苏联提出的建议为基础讨论这些问题，并使讨论能够获得积极的结果，以便使广泛发展和平利用原子能的国际合作真正能够得到保证。
