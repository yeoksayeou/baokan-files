　　The "1955 National Basketball Demonstration" continued on the 20th.

　　Vice Chairman Zhu De and Vice Premier of the State Council He Long attended and watched the demonstration.

　　From November 16th to the 20th, a total of fourteen men's and women's basketball games were held in the demonstration, with more than 30,000 spectators.

　　Among the women's basketball teams participating in this demonstration, the Central South Institute of Physical Education White Team, the East China Institute of Physical Education Team, and the Northeast Institute of Physical Education Team had the same scores in the recently held "1955 National Basketball League," and the second, third, and fourth places could not be determined. Therefore, these three teams held a round-robin tournament before and during this demonstration. As a result, the Central South Institute of Physical Education White Team defeated the East China Institute of Physical Education Team and the Northeast Institute of Physical Education Team with scores of 87 to 61 and 63 to 62, respectively, and won the second place in the women's group of the "1955 National Basketball League." The East China Institute of Physical Education Team defeated the Northeast Institute of Physical Education Team with a score of 74 to 69, winning third place; the Northeast Institute of Physical Education Team took fourth place.

　　The men's basketball demonstration games in the past few days have been very intense. The offensive capabilities of the eight participating teams are very strong. The players of these teams not only cooperate closely but also pay attention to leveraging the strengths of each individual. For example, players with a height of more than 1.90 meters are more active under the basket, and they have a great advantage when rebounding, shooting, or coordinating the offense of other players on their team. All teams have also adopted an aggressive man-to-man defense during defense.

　　The basketball teams that won the "1955 National Basketball League" have still shown a high level of skill in this demonstration. On the 17th, when the Northeast Institute of Physical Education men's basketball team, which won the runner-up in the league, held a demonstration game with the famous "August 1st" men's basketball team of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, they only lost by eight points.

### 一九五五年全国篮球表演赛继续举行

　　一九五五年全国篮球表演赛继续举行
    “一九五五年全国篮球表演赛”二十日继续举行。
    朱德副主席和国务院副总理贺龙出席观看了表演赛。
    表演赛从十一月十六日开始到二十日，共举行了十四场男、女篮球赛，观众有三万多人。
    在参加这次表演赛的女子篮球队中，中南体育学院白队、华东体育学院队和东北体育学院队因为在最近举行的“一九五五年全国篮球联赛”中得分相等，没有能决定出第二、三、四名，所以这三个队在这次表演赛前和表演赛中，又举行了循环赛。结果，中南体育学院白队以八十七比六十一和六十三比六十二的比数，分别战胜了华东体育学院队和东北体育学院队，获得了“一九五五年全国篮球联赛”女子组的第二名；华东体育学院队以七十四比六十九的比数战胜了东北体育学院队，获得了第三名；东北体育学院队得了第四名。
    几天来的男子篮球表演赛进行得很紧张。参加表演赛的八个队的进攻能力都很强。这些队的队员们不但能紧密合作，而且注意发挥每个人的特长。如身高一公尺九十公分以上的队员就较多地在篮下活动，他们在篮下抢球、投篮或者策应本队其他队员进攻的时候占了很大的优势。各队在防守的时候也都采用了积极的人钉人的战术。
    在“一九五五年全国篮球联赛”中获得优胜的篮球队，在这次表演赛中仍然表现了很高的技术水平。十七日，在联赛中获得亚军的东北体育学院男子篮球队同著名的中国人民解放军“八一”男子篮球队举行表演赛时，只输了八分。　（新华社）
