    Editor's Note: The Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee Industrial Bureau Factory Cadre Business Learning Committee wrote to inquire about the economic activity analysis meeting. The answer is as follows:

    Question: What is economic activity analysis? How to carry out economic activity analysis work?

    Answer: Economic activity analysis is an advanced experience of socialist enterprise management in the Soviet Union. Its main task is: based on the plan approved by the state, and based on the party and state's policies and guidelines on economic work, through a comprehensive and systematic inspection of the enterprise's economic activities, identify the various factors affecting the completion of the plan. On this basis, evaluate the enterprise's economic activities, and at the same time formulate specific measures to tap internal potential and overcome weaknesses, and earnestly implement them in order to improve the enterprise management level and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the state plan.

    Economic activity analysis is administrative work, and the enterprise administration is responsible for organizing this work. At the factory (or company) level, an economic activity inspection committee can be organized to specifically strengthen the leadership of the economic activity analysis work. The committee is composed of the factory director (or manager), deputy factory director (or deputy manager), and heads of relevant functional departments, with the factory director (manager) as the chairman. The tasks of the committee are: to draft economic activity analysis reports, to convene and organize economic activity analysis meetings, and to regularly check and supervise to ensure that the resolutions of the economic activity analysis meetings are implemented. Factories and workshops can convene economic activity analysis meetings regularly on a quarterly or monthly basis. In addition to the members of the economic activity inspection committee, the participants can also include the heads of the Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League, as well as labor models and advanced producers. The meeting is chaired by the administrative head. At the meeting, the implementation of the resolutions of the previous meeting and the completion of various planned targets in this period are checked, the reasons are analyzed, improvement measures are determined, resolutions are made, and implemented.

    The Party organization must strengthen its guarantee and supervision role over the enterprise's economic activity analysis work. The Party committee can organize a general meeting of Party members or a meeting of economic activity activists to review the administrative economic activity analysis report. At the meeting, the enterprise administrative负责人 (fuzeren - person in charge) makes an economic activity analysis report, the masses launch discussions and criticisms, and propose measures to improve work. Finally, the Party committee secretary makes a summary and passes a resolution. The resolution of the general meeting of Party members can instruct the Party organization and all Party members to guarantee its implementation. The resolution of the economic activity activists meeting must be reviewed and approved by the Party committee before being transferred to relevant organizations and departments for implementation as a Party resolution. Through the general meeting of Party members and the meeting of economic activity activists, the Party can comprehensively understand the economic activities of the enterprise, strengthen the guarantee and supervision of economic work, and ensure the implementation of the Party and the state's policies, guidelines, instructions, and resolutions on economic work; at the same time, it can mobilize the entire Party and all employees to participate in enterprise management, give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses, and strive to ensure the completion of the state plan.

    Question: What is the difference between the economic activity analysis meeting and the production meeting, the final accounts review meeting, and the cost analysis meeting?

    Answer: The production meeting is the best mass organizational form under the leadership of the trade union to organize the broad masses of workers to carry out competition, promote advanced experience, and improve enterprise management. At the meeting, in addition to discussing various plans, the focus is on mobilizing workers to discuss various key issues in current production: such as the issue of improving equipment utilization, the issue of saving fuel, raw materials, and electricity, and the issue of ensuring product quality and eliminating waste and defective products. Administrative heads should report on the production work and the adoption of various suggestions passed by the production meeting at the production meeting, humbly listen to the criticisms of the workers on the shortcomings in the enterprise's work, and ensure that every rationalization proposal aimed at increasing output, ensuring quality, saving costs, and tapping potential and increasing labor productivity can be implemented. Production meetings can take various forms such as the whole factory, workshop, section, group, and workers of the same type of work.

    Cost analysis meetings and final accounts review meetings are both administrative-led meeting forms. They analyze the completion of a certain type of plan, and through the inspection of a certain aspect of economic activity, discover the weak links existing in enterprise management, and take measures to overcome them. The final accounts review meeting is to check the completion of relevant planned targets through the regular review of financial balance sheets and accounting final accounts, such as whether the task of turning over to the state has been completed, whether the use of working capital is reasonable, etc., and to evaluate the economic activities of the enterprise from the production and financial results; the cost analysis meeting focuses on checking the completion of the cost reduction plan, analyzing the various expenses in the product cost, and finding out whether the consumption of raw materials, fuel and electricity, the use of wage funds, and the expenditure and amortization of various indirect expenses are reasonable. From this, expose the waste and loopholes in enterprise management, and take improvement measures to achieve the purpose of practicing economy, opposing waste, accumulating construction funds for the country's socialist industrialization, and improving the level of enterprise management.

    The economic activity analysis meeting is to comprehensively study various data, and all planned targets of the enterprise must be checked. First, the evaluation is carried out from the total result of the plan completion, and then the relevant issues in all aspects of enterprise management are analyzed. Therefore, the economic activity analysis meeting is a meeting for comprehensively and completely analyzing the economic activities of the enterprise.

    什么叫做经济活动分析
    编者按：杭州市人民委员会工业局工厂干部业务学习委员会来信，询问有关经济活动分析会议的问题，现在答复如下：
    问：什么叫做经济活动分析？怎样来进行经济活动分析工作？
    答：经济活动分析是苏联社会主义企业管理的先进经验。它的主要任务在于：根据国家批准的计划，根据党和国家有关经济工作的方针政策，通过对企业经济活动全面而系统的检查，找出影响计划完成的各项因素，在这个基础上对企业经济活动作出评价，同时制定挖掘内部潜力、克服薄弱环节的具体措施，认真贯彻执行，以达到提高企业管理水平、保证完成和超额完成国家计划的目的。
    经济活动分析是行政业务工作，由企业行政负责组织这项工作。厂（或公司）一级可组织经济活动检查委员会，以具体加强对经济活动分析工作的领导。委员会由厂长（或经理）、副厂长（或副经理）以及有关职能科长组成，厂长（经理）为主任委员。委员会的任务是：起草经济活动分析报告，召集和组织经济活动分析会议，并且经常检查督促，使经济活动分析会议的决议贯彻执行。厂和车间可以按季或按月定期召开经济活动分析会议，参加的人除了经济活动检查委员会委员以外，还可以吸收党、工会、青年团的负责人和劳动模范、先进生产者等人；会议由行政负责人主持。在会上检查上次会议决议执行情况和这一时期各项计划指标完成情况，分析原因，确定改进的措施，并且作出决议，贯彻执行。
    党的组织必须加强对企业经济活动分析工作的保证监督作用，可以由党委组织党员大会或经济活动分子会议来审查行政的经济活动分析报告。在会上由企业行政负责人作经济活动分析报告，群众展开讨论和批评，提出改进工作的措施，最后由党委书记作总结，并通过决议。党员大会决议可责成党的组织和全体党员保证执行。经济活动分子会议决议须经党委审核批准后，作为党的决议转有关组织和部门执行。通过党员大会和经济活动分子会议可以使党全面地了解企业的经济活动情况，加强对经济工作的保证监督，保证党和国家有关经济工作的方针、政策、指示、决议的贯彻执行；同时可以动员全党和全体职工参加企业管理，发挥广大群众的积极性和创造性，为保证国家计划的完成而奋斗。
    问：经济活动分析会议和生产会议、决算审查会议、成本分析会议有什么区别？
    答：生产会议是在工会领导下，组织广大职工群众开展竞赛运动，推广先进经验，改进企业管理的最好的群众性的组织形式。在会议上，除了讨论各种计划以外，主要是发动职工讨论当前生产中的各种关键问题：如提高设备利用率问题，节约燃料、原料、电力问题，保证产品质量、消灭废品劣品问题等。行政负责人应该在生产会议上报告生产工作情况和生产会议通过的各项建议采纳情况，虚心地听取职工群众对企业工作中存在毛病的批评，并保证每一项目的在于增加产量、保证质量、节约成本和发挥潜力、提高劳动生产率的合理化建议都能够贯彻实现。生产会议可以有全厂、车间、工段、小组和同工种工人等各种形式。
    成本分析会议和决算审查会议都是行政领导的会议形式，它对某一种计划完成情况进行分析，通过某一方面经济活动的检查，来发现企业管理中存在的薄弱环节，并采取措施，进行克服。决算审查会议就是通过对财务借贷平衡表、会计决算的定期审查，检查有关计划指标完成情况，如上缴任务是否完成，流动资金运用是否合理等，从生产财务成果上来评价企业的经济活动；成本分析会议着重在检查降低成本计划完成的情况，分析产品成本中的各项费用，发现原材料、燃料和电力的消耗、工资基金的使用、各项间接费用的支出和摊销等是否合理，从中暴露出企业管理中的浪费现象和漏洞，并且采取改进措施，来达到厉行节约、反对浪费，为国家社会主义工业化积累建设资金和提高企业管理水平的目的。
    经济活动分析会议则是综合地研究各种资料，对企业各种计划指标都要进行检查，先从计划完成的总的结果进行评价，再进一步对企业管理各个方面的有关问题进行分析。因此，经济活动分析会议是对企业经济活动全面而完整地进行分析的会议。
