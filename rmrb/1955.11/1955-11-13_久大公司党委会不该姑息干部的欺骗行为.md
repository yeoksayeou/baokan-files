The Jiu Da Company Party Committee Should Not Connive at the Deceptive Behavior of Cadres
To the Editor:

    On September 18th, the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily published a reader's letter titled "The Mistakes of Duan Mingyou Must Be Seriously Dealt With"; before this, as early as July 19th, the "New Zigong Daily" had also exposed Duan Mingyou's mistakes. However, until mid-October, the CCP Zigong City Jiu Da Company Committee had not seriously and earnestly handled this issue. When the People's Daily sent a letter urging for the handling situation, the Party Committee Secretary Wang Peiqin asked someone to reply that it was "being handled," attempting to drag the matter out and let it drop.

    The Jiu Da Company Party Committee used some wrong excuses to delay dealing with Duan Mingyou's mistakes. For example, they said, "If the city hasn't handled it, it's hard for us to do it." In fact, the Municipal Party Committee had already pointed out Duan Mingyou's serious mistakes in July, instructing the Jiu Da Company Party Committee to conduct a detailed investigation and handling. In mid-September, because the city-level organs were carrying out the suppression of counter-revolutionaries movement, the Municipal Supervision Committee and the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department notified the Jiu Da Company Party Committee to temporarily transfer Duan Mingyou away from the Tenth Well to await handling. However, the Jiu Da Company Party Committee never actively implemented these instructions, and Duan Mingyou remained the Party Branch Secretary of the Tenth Well, and he became even more irresponsible in his work.

    Enclosed is a letter from our newspaper's correspondent Wang Dunhou (staff member of the CCP Zigong Municipal Party Committee Organization Department stationed at the Jiu Da Company, a CCP member), which exposes the Jiu Da Company Party Committee's delay in handling Duan Mingyou's issue in more detail. We believe that the Jiu Da Company Party Committee's practice of condoning cadres and using deceptive means to resist newspaper criticism is very wrong and should be severely criticized.

    Wang Dunhou's Letter
To the Editor:

    I want to expose the fact that the Jiu Da Company Party Committee has adopted a conniving attitude towards the serious mistakes committed by Duan Mingyou, the Party Branch Secretary of the Tenth Well, and has been delaying handling them.

    As early as June of this year, comrades from the Organization Department of the CCP Zigong Municipal Party Committee discovered Duan Mingyou's serious misconduct during inspection work and reported it to the Jiu Da Company Party Committee. However, the Jiu Da Company Party Committee believed that Duan Mingyou "has a way of doing things in his work, has strong principles, and only has some minor shortcomings." At the Municipal Party Committee's Industry Conference in early July, after Wang Fuyuan, Minister of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee, pointed out Duan Mingyou's serious mistakes, the Jiu Da Company Party Committee, although it asked the Party Committee Organization Department to conduct an investigation, suppressed the investigation report after it was completed. It was not until September 13th, due to the constant urging from the Zigong Municipal Supervision Committee and the CCP Zigong Municipal Party Committee Organization Department, that they sent the report to the Municipal Supervision Committee for approval. In order to solve the leadership problem of the Tenth Well in a timely manner, the Municipal Supervision Committee and the Organization Department notified the Jiu Da Company Party Committee to first transfer Duan Mingyou away from the Tenth Well, and the issue of punishment would be announced after the city officially approved it; someone else would be assigned to be the Party Branch Secretary of the Tenth Well. However, Cui Mande, Deputy Secretary of the Jiu Da Company Party Committee, and Gao Chengju, Minister of the Organization Department, both believed that "no one can be found to serve as the Party Branch Secretary of the Tenth Well at present," and Comrade Wang Peiqin, the Party Committee Secretary, also believed that "there is no place to place Duan Mingyou if he is transferred back." Therefore, Duan Mingyou continued to serve as the Party Branch Secretary of the Tenth Well. During this period, the "New Zigong Daily" and the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily successively published criticisms of Duan Mingyou, but these did not arouse the due attention of the Jiu Da Company Party Committee.

    In this situation, how did Duan Mingyou perform? He did not humbly accept criticism, examine and correct his mistakes, but instead made a big fuss, became even more irresponsible in his work, and even affected the completion of the Tenth Well's production tasks during this period, and accidents continued to occur. From October 1st to 9th alone, eight accidents occurred at the Tenth Well, resulting in a shortfall of 716 dan of brine; in September, the shortfall of brine produced at the Tenth Well was as high as 3,350 dan.

    I believe that the Jiu Da Party Committee should immediately change this wrong attitude and seriously and quickly handle Duan Mingyou's mistakes.
             Wang Dunhou

### 久大公司党委会不该姑息干部的欺骗行为

　　久大公司党委会不该姑息干部的欺骗行为编辑同志：
    九月十八日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表了“必须严肃处理段明友的错误”的读者来信；在这以前，早在七月十九日，“新自贡报”也曾揭发了段明友的错误。但是，直到十月中旬，中共自贡市久大公司委员会还没有严肃认真地处理这个问题。而在人民日报发信催问处理情况的时候，党委书记王培勤却让人回信说是“正在处理中”，企图把事情拖延下去，不了了之。
    久大公司党委会用了一些错误的借口来拖延不处理段明友的错误。例如他们说：“市里没处理，我们不好办。”事实上，市委早在七月份就已经指出段明友的严重错误，责成久大公司党委进行详细的调查和处理。九月中旬，由于市级机关正开展肃反运动，市监察委员会和市委组织部就通知久大公司党委会先将段明友暂时调离十井，听候处理。但是，久大公司党委会始终没有积极执行这些指示，段明友仍然在十井当支部书记，而他在工作中更加不负责任了。
    随信转去本报通讯员王敦厚（中共自贡市委组织部驻久大公司工作人员，中共党员）的一件来信，这里面比较详细地揭发了久大公司党委会拖延处理段明友问题的情况。我们认为，久大公司党委会这种姑息干部和用欺骗手段来抵制报纸批评的做法是十分错误的，应该受到严厉的批评。
                            新自贡报编辑部
    王敦厚的来信编辑同志：
    我要揭发久大公司党委会对十井党支部书记段明友所犯严重错误采取姑息态度，一直拖延不作处理的事实。
    早在今年六月中共自贡市委组织部的同志在检查工作中就发现了段明友的严重错误行为，并且已经向久大公司党委会反映。但是，久大公司党委会却认为段明友“工作上有一套，原则性强，只是有一些小缺点”。七月初在市委工业会议上，市委组织部王富源部长指出了段明友的严重错误后，久大公司党委虽然让党委组织部进行调查，但是调查结束以后又把调查报告压下来了。直到九月十三日，由于自贡市监察委员会和中共自贡市委组织部不断催促，他们才把报告送到市监察委员会去审批。为了及时解决十井领导问题，市监察委员会和组织部曾通知久大公司党委先把段明友调离十井，处分问题等市里正式批转后再宣布；十井支部书记另派人员担任。但是，久大公司党委会副书记崔满德和组织部部长高成榘都认为“目前找不到人去担任十井支部书记”，党委书记王培勤同志又认为“将段明友调回来也没有安插的地方”，因此，段明友还是继续担任着十井支部书记的工作。在这期间，“新自贡报”和人民日报“读者来信专页”先后发表了对段明友的批评，而这些也并没有引起久大公司党委会应有的重视。
    在这样的情况下，段明友的表现是怎样呢？他并没有虚心地接受批评，检查和改正自己的错误，反而大闹情绪，对工作更加不负责任，以致影响到这个时期内十井生产任务完不成，事故不断发生。单是十月一日到九日，十井就发生了八次事故，短产卤水七百一十六担；九月份十井短产卤水也达三千三百五十担之多。
    我认为久大党委应该立即改变这种错误态度，严肃地迅速处理段明友的错误。             王敦厚
