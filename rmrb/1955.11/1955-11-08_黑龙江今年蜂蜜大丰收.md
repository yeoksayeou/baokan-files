Heilongjiang Province has achieved a bumper honey harvest this year. The estimated output will reach more than 1.5 million jin, exceeding the output of previous years by more than double.

Honey is a major native product of Heilongjiang Province, with a large annual output. Hundreds of thousands of jin are exported abroad and supplied to domestic needs every year. This year, the honey harvest is abundant and the quality of the honey is also excellent, with most of it being bright and crystalline first-class honey. At present, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province have already purchased more than 1.2 million jin.
