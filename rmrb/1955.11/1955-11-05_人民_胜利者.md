    The People—Victors
    Su Erke夫, Head of the Soviet Cultural Delegation
    The three weeks that our Soviet cultural delegation has spent in the People's Republic of China have flown by like a single day.
    Three weeks is not a long time. It is difficult to see everything, see everything clearly, and understand everything in this period. Nevertheless, from the things we have seen and understood alone, the face of the new China of the people has already been revealed to each of us.
    When visiting historical sites in Beijing, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing, we saw firsthand how deep the historical roots of the culture of the Chinese people today are. The historical relics, now carefully protected by the People's Government, show us the source of the people's invincible vitality. The people have endured many foreign invasions and enslavement and have finally been able to shake off the heavy burden of foreign enslavers and their Chinese servants from their shoulders.
    In praising the works of ancient Chinese poets, in viewing the murals in the Dunhuang Grottoes and the ancient paintings faded by time with admiration, in hearing the performances of Chinese traditional operas by the best actors of Peking Opera, Yue Opera, and Sichuan Opera, we compared all this with the modern art and literature of China that we know. We have seen that the creations of modern masters are closely related to their glorious predecessors. These solid threads of continuous tradition are a solid guarantee for the promotion and development of the new Chinese culture today and tomorrow.
    When recognizing the works of Lu Xun, Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Ba Jin, Zhao Shuli, Ding Ling, and other outstanding modern Chinese writers based on Russian translations, Soviet readers have justly given them high praise. Comparing the poems and prose of modern Chinese poets with the works of ancient poets and with the novels "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and "Water Margin", we have not only seen the careful inheritance of literary traditions, but also the bold and revolutionary innovations of the most talented representatives of modern Chinese literature.
    Every art lover cannot but admire the beauty, perfection, and profound populism of the works of outstanding painters such as the elderly Qi Baishi and the recently deceased Xu Beihong. They and their young colleagues have shown in their creations a continuous inheritance of the artistic genius of the Chinese people.
    Both in China and in our motherland, in Moscow, we have enjoyed the performances of Chinese opera and music and dance troupes with great excitement and aesthetic satisfaction. Everything we have seen and heard eloquently shows that ancient Chinese art, performed with utmost perfection by modern people, has a living soul, is not tainted by the cold atmosphere of the museum, and can reach the hearts of us modern people both in China and abroad.
    We watched and listened to many classical and modern operas, watched dramas on modern themes, and watched classical and modern dances. We listened to classical and modern music performed by many of the best folk instrumental bands and symphony orchestras in various cities. In further comparisons, we cannot help but feel the clear inheritance and exciting innovation of musical and dramatic traditions. This innovation is manifested in the works of modern playwrights and composers and in the performances of actors and musicians.
    The richest impressions we have gained from watching and listening, together with the many meetings and conversations with writers and artists, have repeatedly made us feel the need to further consolidate the fraternal ties between the literature and art of People's China and the Soviet Union. We, who are engaged in revolutionary Soviet art and literature, have something to pass on to our Chinese comrades from our rich creative experience. At the same time, for us, the source of Chinese art is inexhaustible, and the experience of modern Chinese artists, due to generous fraternal exchanges, is also very beneficial to the art of the two great nations.
    The countless signs of huge and constant positive construction activities being carried out by the Chinese people all over the country have left indelible impressions on our memories.
    In the first few days of living in Beijing, when walking on the streets and visiting the suburbs, we saw firsthand the huge scale of construction. No matter which street you go to, no matter which direction you look in—construction scaffolding is erected everywhere, and walls are being built quickly everywhere. New factories are being built here, new college buildings are erected there, and in the scaffolding next to them, you can also see the wide entrance to the future theater. Workers' clubs and workers' residential areas and hospitals are being built. This is what we saw in the capital. But when we traveled to other places, the same huge construction picture unfolded before us in Xi'an and Chongqing, in Wuhan and Guangzhou, in the resort area of Hangzhou, and in Nanjing. The picture that we Soviets were familiar with in the first five-year plan era has resurfaced in our memories!
    In Xi'an, on a rainy day, we took a car to visit the ancient Big Wild Goose Pagoda. At first, our journey was through the streets of the city, where construction scaffolding could be seen on almost every street. Then we drove out of the city. An annoying drizzle began to fall. Hundreds of people walked with umbrellas. Our car overtook trucks and carts carrying construction materials. From time to time, we saw carts and trucks turning to the side of the road and unloading the materials they were carrying next to the construction scaffolding of the new construction site. Already on a road far from the city, dozens of workers were digging foundations on the left side of the road, and bricklayers were laying bricks on the foundations, while on the other side, harvesting work was taking place almost two steps away. Farmers are harvesting grain. This picture is a symbol of China today—the labor of workers and builders and farmers and tillers merges into a unified upsurge. When we came to the new construction site and understood the labor of the workers, we saw how enthusiasm and diligence, in the case of not yet fully mechanization, are helping to build large buildings that are complex in terms of technology and architecture firmly and in a very short period of time.
    The lives of the workers in the enterprises we visited in Xi'an, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou have new indelible characteristics. The six years of the victory of the new system of people's lives have left profound and indelible traces in the lives and labor of metallurgical workers in Chongqing, textile workers in Xi'an, and silk and art workers in Hangzhou. Workers have experienced that they are the masters of life. Their rationalization ideas are acting bravely and stubbornly. Labor, which six years ago was an unbearable, arduous, physically exhausting, and soul-humiliating thing, has now become a pleasant thing for oneself and for one's own future. When visiting factories and enterprises, we saw everywhere the signs of the People's Government's concern for the welfare of industrial workers—their daily lives, their residences, their culture, health, and rest. Everywhere we went, the modernization of production equipment and technology was underway. New factory buildings are being built or have already been built. And what is particularly gratifying is that when workers talk about their motherland's factories manufacturing new machines for factories and enterprises, they all feel very happy and proud.
    In the suburbs of Beijing and in Guangdong Province, the farthest and hottest south of China, we visited two agricultural production cooperatives with different living and working conditions for the farmers in these two cooperatives. The nature in the south is more abundant and beautiful than in the north. Different trees grow in the gardens in the two places. Different grains grow in the fields in the two places. But in both the north and the south, we have seen friendly common labor, which brings greater harvests to laborers than individual labor. According to all this, it can be seen that land reform has liberated the dormant creativity of the Chinese countryside, and the initial experience of common labor is increasingly gaining the approval of farmers. The People's Government not only deprived the parasites of land but also handed it over to the laborers. The People's Government brought enlightenment to the countryside and, along with it, culture. At the same time, it also awakened the joyous creative activities of the people's genius.
    In a cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing, we visited the residence of a female member—a forty-seven-year-old widow. On that clean half of the wall hung photos of the whole family, portraits of Mao Zedong, Zhu De, and Stalin, and colorful picture posters. Among them are two honorary certificates that the hostess's young son received for his bravery in combat and heroic labor. This previously landless female farm laborer, to whom the People's Government brought light and hope, told us with happiness and excitement how illiteracy is being eliminated in the village, and wrote her name in my notebook with trembling hands.
    When visiting the fields of a cooperative on the banks of the Pearl River in the south, we walked across a small wooden bridge spanning an irrigation canal. I noticed that neatly carved on the painted wooden planks were Chinese characters painted in red.
    I asked the comrade who was accompanying me what this was.
    "These wooden planks are obviously plaques taken by the farmers from the manor of the overthrown landlord. The former rulers of the village used these plaques to praise their 'benevolence and morality'."
    The farmers, who not long ago were slaves and unpaid debtors of this swaggering parasite, are now walking across the small wooden bridge with us.
    They confidently wiped off the words of praise on the wooden planks with the soles of their cloth shoes in the attitude of masters. Just like in the whole of China—the 600 million laborers on all the free land are wiping away the painful traces of the days of landlord enslavement not long ago.
    In a short period of time, we have been to many places and met many people in the new China, whether young pioneers, young workers, or white-haired farmers working in the rice paddies—they all warmly gave us sincere friendship and fraternal love.
    After each such meeting, after each expression of such friendship and respect for our motherland, for our Communist Party and its leaders, there is always an ardent wish to contribute all our strength to further consolidate the eternal friendship between the people of our two countries and the working people of the world.
    I am writing these few paragraphs on the last day of our trip to China. In the morning, the plane that took off from Shanghai brought us to Nanjing, where we climbed the mountain to Zhongshan Mausoleum in order to pay tribute to the person commemorated by the great people. The powerful engine lifted our plane into the high altitude again. When crossing the large and small rivers, lakes, and canals interwoven like silver spider webs on the vast land, the plane moved northwest—towards ancient Beijing.
    The engine was humming rhythmically, and under the green wings of the plane was the vast and boundless countryside, every inch of which had been lovingly cultivated by the powerful and tenacious hands of hundreds of generations of Chinese farmers. The complex patterns of the countryside, the villages hidden in the greenery, and the flat houses of the big cities, the smoke of the factories faintly visible above the cities, all of this is like an enthusiastic narrative poem praising the diligence and loyalty, the genius and boldness of the great people, praising the spirit of the great people who have maintained the living inheritance and vitality of a civilization with 5,000 years of history on the earth.
    While reading a few paragraphs of this magnificent epic, I would like to wish the heroic Chinese working people, led by the heroic Communist Party, who are going from victory to victory, the greatest achievements in the great struggle for the future that began many years ago and has already achieved remarkable achievements.

    人民—胜利者
    苏联文化代表团团长　苏尔科夫
    我们苏联文化代表团在中华人民共和国逗留的三个星期，就像一天一样飞快地过去了。
    三个星期是一段不长的时间。在这个期间要想什么都看到，什么都看得清清楚楚并且全部了解，那是很困难的。虽然这样，仅从我们所看到的和认识到的那些东西，人民新中国的面貌就已经显示在我们每个人的面前了。
    在北京、西安、重庆、广州、杭州、南京参观古迹的时候，我们亲眼看到了中国人民今天的文化有着多么深远的历史根源。现在由人民政权精心保护的历史文物，向我们表明了人民的不可战胜的生活力的源泉。人民经受了许多外国的侵略和奴役，终于能从自己肩上摆脱外国奴役者及其中国奴仆们的沉重压迫的羁绊。
    在赞美中国古代诗人的作品的时候，在以景仰的心情观看敦煌石窟壁画和因时间长久而褪色的古代绘画的时候，在听到京剧、越剧、川剧最好的演员们表演的中国传统歌剧的时候，我们曾把这一切拿来同我们所知道的中国的现代艺术和文学作品相比较。我们看到了现代大师们的创作同他们光荣的前辈们有着血肉的联系。这些一脉相连的传统继承性的坚实的线索，是今天和明天中国新文化发扬光大的牢固的保证。
    根据俄文译文来认识鲁迅、郭沫若、茅盾、巴金、赵树理、丁玲和现代中国其他杰出的文学家们的作品时，苏联读者们公正地给了他们高度的评价。把现代中国诗人的诗歌和散文同古代诗人的作品相比，同小说“三国演义”、“水浒”相比，我们不仅亲眼看到对文学传统的精心的继承，而且也看到现代中国文学最有才能的代表们大胆的富有革命性的革新。
    每个爱好美术的人不能不赞美那些杰出的画家们如高龄的齐白石和不久前过早逝世的徐悲鸿的作品的优美、完善和深刻的人民性。他们和他们年轻的同行们在自己的创作中表现出对中国人民美术天才一脉相连的继承。
    在中国以及在我们的祖国，在莫斯科，我们都以极大的兴奋和美感上的满足欣赏了中国歌剧和音乐舞蹈团的演出。我们所看到和听到的一切，都雄辩地表明，由现代人极其完美地表演的古代中国艺术，有着活生生的灵魂，没有沾染到博物馆的冰冷气氛，它能够通达中国国内和国外的我们现代人的心。
    我们看了和听了许多古典的和现代的歌剧，观看了现代题材的戏剧，看过古典的和现代的舞蹈。我们在各个不同的城市里听了由许多最好的民间器乐队和交响乐队表演的古典的和现代的音乐。在进一步比较中，我们不能不感到对音乐和戏剧传统的鲜明的继承性和令人兴奋的革新。这种革新表现在现代剧作家和作曲家们的作品及演员和音乐家们的表演中。
    我们从看和听所得到的最丰富的印象，同文学和艺术家们的多次会见和谈话，都一再使我们感到进一步巩固人民中国和苏联的文学和艺术之间兄弟般联系的必要性。我们从事革命的苏维埃艺术和文学工作的人们，从我们丰富的创作经验中是有可以转达给中国同志们的东西的。同时对于我们来说，中国艺术的源泉也是取之不尽的，中国现代艺术家们的经验，由于慷慨的兄弟般的交流，也是很有益于两大民族的艺术的。
    中国人民在全国各地进行着无数的巨大而经常的积极性建设活动的标志，在我们的记忆中刻下了不可磨灭的印象。
    在北京生活的最初几天里，当在街上漫步和游览市郊的时候，我们亲眼看到了巨大的建筑规模。无论走到哪条街道，无论向哪个方向看去——到处都耸立着建筑工架，到处都是迅速砌造起来的墙壁。这里建设着新工厂，那里矗立起新的高等学校的校舍，在旁边的建筑工架中又看到未来剧院的宽阔的剧场的入口。工人俱乐部和工人住宅区、医院正在建设着。这是我们在首都看到的。但是当我们到外地旅行的时候，同样，在西安和重庆，在武汉和广州，在疗养地区杭州和在南京，巨大的建设图画也展现在我们的面前。我们苏联人在头几个五年计划年代所熟悉的图画又在我们的记忆里重新泛起！
    在西安，一个阴雨天，我们乘车去参观古老的大雁塔。起初我们的行程是穿过城市的街道，那里几乎在每一条街上都看得见建筑工架。接着我们驶出了城区。天落起令人厌烦的细雨。成百的人们打着雨伞走路。我们的汽车赶过了载着建筑材料的卡车和大车。我们不时看到大车和卡车转向路边，在新建筑工地的建筑工架旁卸下装载的材料。已经是在离城很远的一条道路上，路左边有几十个工人挖掘了房基，泥瓦工们把砖头砌在地基上，而在另一边，收获工作却就在几乎两步远的地方进行。农民在收割谷物。这幅图画是今天中国的象征——工人建设者和农民耕种者的劳动汇合成一致的热潮。当我们来到新建筑工地、了解了工人的劳动的时候，我们看到，在目前机械化还不充分的情况下，热忱和勤劳在怎样帮助坚实地并且在非常短的时期内建筑起在技术和建筑术方面都是复杂的巨大建筑物。
    我们所访问过的西安、重庆、上海和杭州的企业中的工人的生活，有着新的不可磨灭的特征。在重庆的冶金工人、西安的纺织工人和杭州的丝织工人和美术工人的生活和劳动中，留下了人民生活新制度胜利的六年的深刻而不可磨灭的痕迹。工人体验到了自己是生活的主人。他们的合理化思想正在勇敢而顽强地活动着。劳动，在六年以前还是不可忍受的、苦役的、使身体疲惫并使心灵受到屈辱的事情，如今已经变成对自己、对自己的未来都是愉快的事情了。在访问工厂企业时，我们到处看到了人民政权关心工业工人们的福利——他们的日常生活、他们的住宅、他们的文化、健康、休息——的标志。我们所到之处，生产设备和技术的现代化都在进行。新的厂房正在建设中或者已经建设起来。而特别令人高兴的是，工人们在谈到自己祖国的工厂在给工厂企业制造新机器的时候，他们都感到十分愉快和骄傲。
    在北京城郊和中国最辽远的炎热的南方广东省，我们访问了两个农业生产合作社，这两个合作社的农民的生活和劳动条件是不同的。南方的大自然比北方更加丰盛而艳丽。两地的园子里长着不同的树木。两地的田里生长着不同的谷物。但是在北方和南方我们都看到了友好的共同劳动，给劳动者带来比个体劳动更大的丰收。根据这一切都可以看出，土地改革解放了中国农村沉睡的创造力，共同劳动最初的经验越来越多地争取到农民的赞同。人民政权不仅从寄生者那里剥夺了土地，并且转交给了劳动者。人民政权给农村带来了启蒙，并且随之带来了文化。同时也就唤起了人民天才的欢乐的创造性活动。
    在北京城郊的合作社里，我们访问了一个女社员——四十七岁的寡妇的住宅。在那半边干净的墙壁上悬挂着全家的照片，毛泽东、朱德、斯大林的画像，五光十色的挂图。其中有女主人的一个年轻儿子由于果敢作战和英勇劳动而获得的两张荣誉奖状。人民政权给她带来光明和希望的这个以前无地的女雇农，以幸福激动的心情向我们讲述了村里正在如何扫除文盲，并用颤抖的手在我的笔记本上写下了她的姓名。
    在参观南方珠江江畔一个合作社的田园时，我们走过横架在灌溉渠上的一座小木桥。我注意到在油漆过的木板上整齐地雕有涂着红颜色的中国字。
    我问伴随着我的同志这是什么。
    “这些木板显然是农民从斗倒的地主的庄园里拿来的匾额。村庄从前的统治者是用这些匾额颂扬自己的‘仁义道德’的。”
    不久以前曾是这个耀武扬威的寄生虫的奴隶和无法偿还债务的负债人的农民们，如今同我们一起走过了小木桥。
    他们以主人的态度用便鞋的鞋底自信地擦掉了木板上的歌功颂德的字。就像在全中国那样——全部自由的土地上的六亿劳动者们，正在擦掉不久以前地主奴役日子的痛苦痕迹。
    在很少的时间里我们到过了许多地方，同新中国的许多人相会过，不论是年少的少先队员、年轻的工人或在稻田中劳动的白发的农民——他们全都亲热地给了我们诚挚的友谊和兄弟般的爱。
    在每次这样的会见之后，在每次表示这样的友谊和对我们的祖国、对我国共产党及其领导者们表示敬意之后，总是热烈而又热烈地愿望把全部力量贡献给进一步巩固我们两国人民和全世界劳动人民之间的永恒友谊。
    在我们旅行中国的最后一天我来写这几段话。早晨从上海起飞的飞机把我们带到了南京，在这里我们登山走向中山陵，以便在伟大人民所纪念的人之前致敬。强大的发动机又把我们的飞机升入高空。在横越像银色蜘蛛网一样交织在辽阔的大地上的大大小小的河川、湖泊、运河的时候，飞机向西北方向——古老的北京前进。
    马达在匀称地轰鸣着，飞机的绿色羽翼下是辽阔无边的田园，这些田园的每一寸土地都曾被数百代中国农民有力的和坚韧的手爱护地耕作过。田园的这些复杂的图案和隐藏在绿荫中的农村以及大城市的平房，在城市上空隐隐约约看得见的工厂的烟，这一切如同歌颂伟大人民的勤劳和忠勇、天才和豪迈的热情的叙事诗，歌颂大地上保持了有着五千年文明的活生生的继承性和生气勃勃的伟大人民的精神。
    读到这篇雄伟的史诗中的几段的时候，我愿祝英雄的共产党所领导的、从胜利走向胜利的、英勇的中国劳动人民，在为许多年前所开始并已取得卓越成就的未来所进行的巨大斗争中，获得最大的成就。
