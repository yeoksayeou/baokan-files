Xinhua News Agency, November 1st. The Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce opened in Beijing on the morning of the 1st.

Attending the meeting were: Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, Vice-Chairmen Li Zhuchen, Nan Hanchen, Zhang Naiqi, Xu Dixin, Meng Yongqian, Sheng Pihua, Rong Yiren, Chen Jingyu, Huang Changshui, Hu Ziang, Gong Tianmin, and 174 committee members. Fifty-one people attended as observers.

Today's meeting heard a report by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, entitled "Adapt to the Situation of the Development of the National Socialist Economic Construction and Strive to Further Promote National Industrialists and Businessmen to Actively Accept Socialist Transformation," as well as a report on the work of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce over the past two years, a financial report for the past two years, and a preliminary opinion report on several organizational issues of the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The meeting will discuss these reports.

In his report, Chen Shutong said: The convening of this meeting at this time is of great significance. The First Five-Year Plan is proceeding smoothly, socialist industrialization has achieved significant accomplishments, the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement will appear nationwide, and the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state has also made new progress. Many lower-level and intermediate-level state capitalist enterprises have gradually moved towards higher-level forms. At present, the state is adopting new methods such as overall planning, economic reorganization, and transformation by industry to transform private industry and commerce, which marks a step forward in the state's implementation of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

After talking about the general situation of China's economic development, Chen Shutong said: As everyone knows, socialist economy and capitalist economy are opposed and contradictory. With the development of the country's socialist industrialization and the arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement, if private industry and commerce are not further transformed, they will not be able to adapt to the new situation of economic development. In order to meet the requirements of the new situation of economic development, in order to control our own destiny and unite our own destiny with the future development of the country, all patriotic industrialists and businessmen should further accept transformation on the existing basis and continue to contribute their strength to the great construction cause of the great motherland.

In his report, Chen Shutong believed that the most basic responsibility and task of industrialists and businessmen during the current great social change period is still to love the country and abide by the law.

He criticized the erroneous views that "loving the country and abiding by the law is old hat," "it is easy to love the country but difficult to abide by the law," or "it is easy to abide by the law but difficult to love the country," and he believed that loving the country and abiding by the law are consistent, and that loving the country, abiding by the law, and accepting socialist transformation are also consistent. He said: Socialist transformation should not only change the old relations of production of enterprises, but also change the old ideological style of every industrialist and businessman. The socialist transformation of private industry and commerce includes two aspects: enterprise transformation and personal transformation. In terms of enterprises, it is necessary to change the capitalist ownership of enterprises into socialist public ownership; in terms of individuals, it is necessary to change oneself from an exploiter into a citizen of a socialist society who loves labor, has labor skills, and is self-reliant, and this is a long and arduous struggle process.

Chen Shutong said in his report: In order to defend the fruits of our revolutionary victory and ensure the completion of the Five-Year Plan, another important task for our industrialists and businessmen at present is to actively participate in the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. Our patriotic industrialists and businessmen must further draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy and wage a resolute struggle against all counter-revolutionary elements who undermine our socialist construction and socialist transformation cause.

Chen Shutong said: In the face of the new situation of the country's economic construction and at a time when the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has entered a new stage of development, the responsibilities of advanced elements and backbone elements in the business community are even greater than before. He said: The characteristics of advanced elements and backbone elements are, first of all, that under the leadership of the Communist Party and the government, through continuous self-education and self-transformation, they can look forward, see widely, see far, see the historical process of China's social development, see the brightness of the socialist future, and not be afraid of socialism, and thus be able to control their own destiny and consciously and happily accept socialist transformation and actively participate in the ranks of China's socialist construction. The responsibility of advanced elements and backbone elements also lies in telling others what they know and see, so that others can see more widely and farther, tell everyone the superiority of socialism and the truth that socialism will surely win, strengthen everyone's confidence in taking the socialist road, and set an example to lead, discover, unite, and cultivate more progressive elements and backbone elements, and assist the government in carrying out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce.

Sha Qianli, Secretary-General of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said in the two-year work report made on behalf of the Standing Committee of the Federation of Industry and Commerce that in the two years from the formal establishment of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce to the present, the state has put forward the general task for the transition period, promulgated the Constitution, formulated the first Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy, strengthened the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and clarified the steps and arrangements for the transformation. These are two great and historically significant years. In the past two years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the Federation of Industry and Commerce has conducted propaganda and education on the general task of the state during the transition period to the vast number of industrialists and businessmen nationwide, so that the majority of industrialists and businessmen have basically clarified the policies of utilization, restriction, and transformation adopted by the state for capitalist industry and commerce, and have clarified the necessity and importance of transformation, and assisted the government in promoting the development of private industry and commerce towards various forms of state capitalism; widely publicized the Constitution to industrialists and businessmen and organized learning, and strengthened education on loving the country and abiding by the law.

Sha Qianli said in the report that in the past two years, organizations at all levels, under the leadership of the local party committee, government, and relevant departments, have assisted state organs in publicizing policies and implementing laws and regulations; organized people from the business community to participate in study, conduct ideological transformation, and participate in various patriotic movements; assisted private industry and commerce in improving business management, increasing production and practicing economy; cultivated backbone elements and activists, represented the legitimate interests of private industrialists and businessmen, opposed illegal acts, and reflected opinions to the government and put forward suggestions, and coordinated public-private relations and labor-capital relations; At the same time, we have promoted private industrialists and businessmen to obey national plans and actively accept socialist transformation. In addition, it also assisted the government in doing a good job in tax collection and assisted in completing the task of selling the 1954 and 1955 national economic construction bonds in the business community. In the state's issuance of new Renminbi, implementation of unified purchase and sale, launching of the grain conservation campaign, and implementation of grain rationing, organizations at all levels of the Federation of Industry and Commerce have done a lot of supporting work. In the past two years, organizations at all levels of the Federation of Industry and Commerce have also gained some experience in assisting the government in carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce.

Sha Qianli pointed out in the report that the future work of organizations at all levels of the Federation of Industry and Commerce is mainly to assist the government in promoting capitalist industry and commerce to take various forms of state capitalism, especially advanced forms, based on the steps and arrangements stipulated in the Five-Year Plan and in conjunction with the overall trend of the country, under the leadership of the government and state-owned economic departments, and in accordance with the principles of industry-wide arrangements, merger reorganization, and industry-wide joint ventures; At the same time, we will organize individual handicraftsmen and small vendors to develop towards cooperation. In order to strengthen the ideological transformation of individuals, we should expand the scope of study in the business community, popularize publicity and education, improve patriotic awareness, and strengthen the concept of abiding by the law. We should actively cultivate backbone elements and activists, help them improve their ideological understanding, learn skills, and serve the socialist cause.

    进一步推动工商业者接受社会主义改造
    全国工商联执委会会议开幕
    新华社一日讯　中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会第二次会议一日上午在北京开幕。
    出席这次会议的有：中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会主任委员陈叔通，副主任委员李烛尘、南汉宸、章乃器、许涤新、孟用潜、盛丕华、荣毅仁、陈经畬、黄长水、胡子昂、巩天民和委员共一百七十四人。列席五十一人。
    今天的会议听取了全国工商联执行委员会主任委员陈叔通的题为“适应国家的社会主义经济建设发展的形势，为进一步推动全国工商业者积极接受社会主义改造而奋斗”的报告，以及全国工商业联合会两年工作报告、两年财务报告和关于工商联若干组织问题的初步意见的报告。会议将讨论这些报告。
    陈叔通在报告中说：这次会议在这个时候召开，是有重大意义的。第一个五年计划正在顺利地进行，社会主义工业化已取得了重大成就，农业合作化运动的高潮就将在全国范围内出现，国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也已有了新的发展。许多低级形式和中级形式的国家资本主义企业，已逐步走向高级形式。目前国家正采取统筹安排、经济改组、按行业改造等新方式，对私营工商业进行改造，这标志着国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造向前迈进了一步。
    陈叔通在谈到目前我国经济发展总的形势以后说：大家知道，社会主义经济和资本主义经济是对立的、矛盾的。随着国家的社会主义工业化的发展和农业合作化运动高潮的到来，私营工商业如不进一步进行改造，那就不能适应经济发展的新形势。为了适应经济发展新的形势的要求，为了掌握我们自己的命运，把自己的命运和国家发展的前途统一起来，一切爱国的工商业者，应该在现有的基础上，进一步地接受改造，在伟大祖国的伟大建设事业中，继续贡献自己的力量。
    陈叔通在报告中认为，工商业者在当前伟大的社会变革时期，最起码的也是最基本的责任和任务，仍然是爱国守法。
    他批评那些认为“爱国守法是老生常谈”、“爱国容易守法难”或“守法容易爱国难”等等错误看法，他认为爱国和守法是一致的，爱国守法和接受社会主义改造也是一致的。他说：社会主义改造不但要改变企业的旧的生产关系，而且要改变每个工商业者的旧的思想作风。私营工商业的社会主义改造包括企业改造和个人改造两方面，企业方面要改变企业的资本家所有制为全民所有制，个人方面要把自己从一个剥削者改变为一个爱好劳动、具有劳动技能、自食其力的社会主义社会的公民，而这是一个长期的艰巨的斗争过程。
    陈叔通在报告中说：为了保卫我国革命胜利果实，保证五年计划的完成，目前我们工商业者的另一重要任务，是积极地投入肃清一切反革命分子的斗争。我们爱国的工商业者必须进一步地划清敌我界限，向一切破坏我们社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的反革命分子作坚决的斗争。
    陈叔通说：在国家的经济建设新的形势面前，在对私营工商业的社会主义改造进入新的发展时期，工商界的先进分子、骨干分子的责任比以前更为重大了。他说：先进分子、骨干分子的特点，首先是他们在共产党和政府的领导下，经过不断的自我教育和自我改造，能够向前看，看得广，看得远，看出中国社会发展的历史进程，看到社会主义前途的光明，不害怕社会主义，因而能掌握自己的命运，自觉地、愉快地接受社会主义改造，积极参加我国社会主义建设的行列。先进分子和骨干分子的责任，还在于要把自己所知道的所看到的去告诉别人，使别人也看得广些、远些，把社会主义的优越性和社会主义必定胜利的道理告诉大家，坚定大家走社会主义道路的信心，并以身作则，去带动、发掘、团结、培养更多的进步分子、骨干分子，协助政府对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造。
    全国工商联执行委员会秘书长沙千里在代表工商联常务委员会所作的两年工作报告中说，从中华全国工商业联合会正式成立到现在的两年中，国家提出了过渡时期的总任务，公布了宪法，制定了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，加强了对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，并明确了改造的步骤和部署。这是伟大的具有历史意义的两年。两年来，工商业联合会在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，在全国范围内，对广大工商界进行了关于国家在过渡时期总任务的宣传教育工作，使多数工商业者基本上明确了国家对资本主义工商业所采取的利用、限制、改造的政策，明确了改造的必要性和重要性，协助政府推动私营工商业向各种形式的国家资本主义发展；向工商业者广泛地宣传了宪法并组织了学习，加强了爱国守法的教育。
    沙千里在报告中说，两年来，各级组织在当地党委、政府和有关部门领导下，协助国家机关宣传政策，推行法令；组织工商界人士参加学习，进行思想改造，并参加各项爱国运动；辅导私营工商业改善经营管理，增产节约；培养骨干分子和积极分子，代表私营工商业者的合法利益，反对非法行为，并向政府反映意见，提出建议，协调公私关系和劳资关系；同时推动私营工商业者服从国家计划，积极接受社会主义改造。此外，还协助政府做好税收工作和协助完成了在工商界中推销一九五四年和一九五五年国家经济建设公债的任务。在国家发行新人民币、实行统购统销、开展节约粮食运动和实行粮食定量供应等工作中，工商联各级组织都做了很多配合工作。两年来，工商联各级组织在协助政府对私营工商业进行社会主义改造方面也取得了若干经验。
    沙千里在报告中指出：工商联各级组织今后的工作，主要是根据五年计划所规定的步骤和部署，结合国家总的趋势，在政府和国营经济部门领导下，根据全业安排、合并改组、全业合营的方针，协助政府推动资本主义工商业走上各种国家资本主义形式，特别是高级形式；同时组织个体手工业和小商小贩向合作化道路发展。为了加强对个人的思想改造，应该在工商界扩大学习面，普及宣传教育，提高爱国主义觉悟，加强守法观念。应该积极培养骨干分子和积极分子，帮助他们提高思想认识，学会本领，为社会主义事业服务。
