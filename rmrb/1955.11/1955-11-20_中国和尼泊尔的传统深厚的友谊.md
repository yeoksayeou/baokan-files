　　The Traditional and Profound Friendship Between China and Nepal
　　Huang Shengzhang
    Recently, our country and the Kingdom of Nepal established normal diplomatic relations and determined that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence should be the basic principles guiding the relations between the two countries. The establishment of this new diplomatic relationship between the two countries will undoubtedly help to further deepen the traditional friendship between the two countries in the future.
    China and Nepal are neighbors, with a border stretching over 800 kilometers. The long-standing and close friendship between the two countries in terms of economy and culture can be traced back to 1,500 years ago. The earliest and most reliable record is the "Record of Buddhist Countries" written by the eminent monk Fa Xian of the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Fa Xian was the first foreigner to visit Nepal and leave a true record. He set off for India in 399 AD and returned to China in 416 AD. In 406, he visited Nepal to pay homage to the holy sites of the birth and passing of the founder of Buddhism, Sakyamuni. According to the "Record of Buddhist Countries" he wrote, he visited Kapilavastu, Lumbini Garden, and Kushinagar. Soon after Fa Xian's visit to Nepal, another Buddhist, Zhimeng, visited Kapilavastu to observe the Buddhist sites.
    At the same time as Fa Xian's visit to Nepal, an eminent Nepalese monk, Buddhabhadra, came to China. He was a native of Kapilavastu, a descendant of the Buddha clan. He arrived in Chang'an around 406 and was invited to Jianye (now Nanjing) in 418 to lead the translation work at the Daochang Temple, leading more than a hundred monks in the joint translation of Buddhist scriptures. This was the largest translation center in the South at that time. At that time, Fa Xian had returned from India and cooperated with Buddhabhadra in Jianye to translate several famous Buddhist scriptures. Buddhabhadra's arrival in southern China had a great influence on the spread of Zen Buddhism in the Southern Dynasties. In 429, Buddhabhadra died in Jianye. He translated a total of fifteen Buddhist scriptures, in one hundred and seventeen volumes, in China, leaving no small contribution to the history of the exchange of Buddhist culture. The cooperative translation of Fa Xian and Buddhabhadra should be said to be a symbol in the history of harmonious Sino-Nepalese friendship.
    During the Tang Dynasty, exchanges between China and Nepal became more frequent. During his journey to the west, Xuanzang visited Nepal in 635. He visited the former Kapilavastu (i.e., Kapilavastu), the Buddha's birthplace pagoda, and Kushinagar (i.e., Kushinagar) that Fa Xian had experienced, and for the first time arrived in the Nepala Kingdom, now the capital of Nepal, Kathmandu.
    In 641, Emperor Taizong of Tang sent Li Yibiao as an envoy to India, passing through Nepal, and was treated with great courtesy by King Naling Deva, who accompanied him to see the Ajivamani Pond in the southeast of the capital (this pond is also recorded in Xuanzang's "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions"). Since then, the exchange of envoys between China and Nepal has been constant. In 647, envoys from the Nepala Kingdom came to Chang'an to present gifts such as spinach, pickled vegetables, and scallions; four years later, in the second year of Emperor Gaozong's Yonghui reign (651), Nepal sent envoys again. The Tang court also sent Wang Xuance to India in 656, and he visited Nepal, arriving in present-day Kathmandu.
    In the mid-7th century, the eminent monk Xuanzhao pioneered a route to India via Tibet and Nepal, then known as the "Tufan Nepala Road." This route was much more convenient than the previous route to India via the north and south routes of the Tianshan Mountains and over the Pamir Mountains. Xuanzhao left Visali in India in September 654, passed through the Nepala Kingdom on his way back to China, and arrived in Luoyang in January of the following year. This is the most convenient record of travel between China and India in history. Monks who came to and from China and India after Xuanzhao, such as Xuan Tai (a Silla person), Dao Xi, Dao Fang, Dao Sheng, Matisimha (Shizi Hui), Xuan Hui, and Hui Lun, all visited Nepal via this route, and some of them died in Nepal.
    Since Kapilavastu and Kushinagar are the places where Sakyamuni was born and passed away, these two places often became the goals of Buddhist pilgrims seeking the Dharma in the West. In Chinese literature, almost all monks who left records of their travels to India visited Nepal. For example, Huichao, who returned to Anxi in 729, wrote "Record of Travels to the Five Kingdoms of India." This book was discovered in Dunhuang and is incomplete, but the surviving part first describes his arrival in Kushinagara and then Kapilavastu. Wukong, who went to India in 750, visited Nepal in 764, and returned to China in 790, orally narrated his travels to the monk Yuanzhao during the Zhenyuan period, and wrote it in the preface to the translated "Ten Powers Sutra." In the accounts of these many monks, they all praised the courtesy of the Nepalese court and people towards Chinese Buddhists, and praised the art and architecture of Nepal. These works and the narratives about the Nepala Kingdom in Chinese historical books not only record the long-standing friendly relations between China and Nepal, but also preserve many valuable materials for the study of the history of Nepal in the Middle Ages.
    Nepal is close to our Tibet, and therefore the relationship between the people of Nepal and our Tibet is also the closest. In frequent and friendly exchanges, our culture was introduced to Nepal, and we also absorbed many cultural achievements of Nepal. The fortress-style palace architecture of the Potala Palace in Lhasa was originally from Nepal. There are also many artisans in Tibet who are Nepalese. At the end of the 6th century, Tibet established the Rasa Temple, enshrining Buddhist statues imported from Nepal, which was the beginning of Buddhist temples in Tibet. This is the "Great Rasa Temple" generally referred to in Lhasa, and Nepalese Buddhists often come to worship.
    During the Song and Yuan dynasties, China and Nepal still had exchanges. In 964, Emperor Taizu of Song sent Jiye and other three hundred monks to India, and returned to China in 975. Jiye took the route through Nepal on his return journey, passing through Kushinagara and Tarapuri and other places. In 1260, Basiba of the Yuan Dynasty built a golden pagoda in Tibet, and Nepal selected eighty artisans to come to Tibet to build it. Among them, the supervisor was Aniko, who was good at painting, sculpture and casting gold statues. After the tower was completed in 1261, Aniko followed Basiba to Beijing to sculpt and cast Buddhist statues, "most of the statues in temples and monasteries in the two capitals were made by him." Later, he served as Guanglu Dafu and Dasitu of the Yuan Dynasty, specializing in the management of construction and casting. Aniko had six sons, one of whom inherited his title of Dasitu, and another served in the Zese Renjiang (i.e., various artisans) General Administration, inheriting his father's profession. Aniko's art of painting, sculpture and casting was also taught to a Chinese, Liu Yuan. Liu Yuan learned to sculpt and cast Western heavenly Buddhist images from Aniko, and was known as "peerless skill" at the time.
    The second period of frequent exchanges between China and Nepal was during the Ming Dynasty. In 1384, Emperor Taizu of Ming sent the eminent monk Zhiguang as an envoy to Nepal, and King Manarama of Nepal immediately sent an envoy in return, arriving in Beijing in 1391, and visiting again in 1394. In the years that followed, envoys from the two countries traveled back and forth constantly. During the reign of Emperor Chengzu of Ming, Zhiguang, Yang Sanbao, and Deng Cheng were sent as envoys to Nepal three times, and each time Nepal sent envoys in return. During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong of Ming, Hou Xian was also sent as an envoy to Nepal.
    In recent centuries, the people of China and Nepal have suffered from the oppression of foreign races and the aggression of imperialism, and the friendly exchanges between the two countries have been greatly hindered. After the British invaded India in the early 19th century, they invaded Nepal and further harbored aggressive ambitions towards our Tibet. To this end, the British deliberately provoked relations between China and Nepal, and created conflicts between the two countries in the 1850s. However, the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the Nepalese people have developed and become closer with the times. In particular, the people in the neighboring areas of China and Nepal closely interact with each other, conduct commerce and trade, and pay homage to Buddhist sites. There are also many Nepalese expatriates living in our Tibet, and their relationship with our people has always been friendly and harmonious.
    After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the long-standing friendship between the people of China and Nepal for 1,500 years has been given the conditions for further development. The Chinese government has always attached importance to peaceful and friendly cooperation with neighboring countries in Asia and other countries. In his report on the work of the government at the First Session of the National People's Congress on September 23 last year, Premier Zhou Enlai stated that China was prepared to establish diplomatic relations with Nepal. This statement was welcomed by the Nepalese government and people. Prominent figures in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, initiated and formed the Nepal-China Friendship Association to actively promote the friendship between the two peoples. The National Committee of the National Democratic Party of Nepal passed a resolution on December 28 last year, supporting the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by China, India, and Myanmar. The delegation of the Kingdom of Nepal to the Asian-African Conference has repeatedly expressed its support for the Five Principles as the basis for expanding cooperation among Asian and African countries. On the basis of adhering to the Five Principles, China and Nepal successfully conducted negotiations on the establishment of diplomatic relations in July this year. In the joint communiqué on the establishment of normal diplomatic relations issued by the two governments on August 1, they also stated: The two governments believe that the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries will also promote the further development of cultural and economic cooperation between the two countries.
    The people of China and Nepal, who have a long and profound friendship, are happy and encouraged by the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the two countries. B. P. Koirala, Chairman of the Nepali Congress Party, and Regmi, Chairman of the National Congress Party, both issued statements welcoming the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Nepal. The Chinese people express their warm congratulations on the new development of friendly relations between China and Nepal. As Ambassador Yuan Zhongxian said to the Nepalese people: "Under the guidance of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, the relations between our two countries will greatly contribute to the prosperity and happiness of the two peoples."

　　中国和尼泊尔的传统深厚的友谊
　　黄盛璋
    最近我国和尼泊尔王国建立了正常的外交关系，并确定以和平共处五项原则为指导两国关系的基本原则。两国这种新的外交关系的建立，无疑将有助于今后进一步加深两国之间的传统友谊。
    中尼两国国境毗连，接壤的疆界长达八百公里以上。两国在经济和文化上的悠久而密切的深厚友谊，可以上溯到一千五百年以前。最早而可靠的记载，是东晋高僧法显所写的“法显传”。法显是外人访问尼泊尔并留有真实纪录的第一人。他于公元三九九年启程赴印度，四一六年归国。在四○六年，他访问了尼泊尔，目的是朝礼佛教创始人释迦牟尼诞生和圆寂的圣地。根据他写的法显传，他曾到过迦维罗卫城、论民园和拘夷那竭城等处，在法显访尼后不久，又有一个佛教徒智猛曾访问迦维罗卫城观礼佛迹。
    和法显访问尼泊尔同时，一位尼泊尔的高僧佛駄跋陀罗到了中国。他是迦维罗卫城人、佛氏的后裔，大约在四○六年左右到达长安，四一八年被邀到建业（现在的南京），做道场寺的译主，领导一百多名沙门共同翻译佛教经典。这是当时南方最大的一个译场。那时候，法显已从印度归国，在建业同佛駄跋陀罗合作，翻译了有名的几部佛经。佛駄跋陀罗来到我国南方，对南朝佛教禅宗的传播很有影响。四二九年，佛駄跋陀罗死在建业。他在中国所翻译的佛经，共一十五部，一百十七卷，在交流佛教文化史上留有不小的功绩。法显和佛駄跋罗陀的合作翻译，应该说是和洽的中尼友谊史上一个标帜。
    在唐代，中国和尼泊尔的交往更频繁了。玄奘法师西游中，在六三五年访问了尼泊尔。他到过以前法显所经历的劫比伐窣堵国（即迦维罗卫城）、佛降生塔和拘尸那竭罗城（即拘夷那竭罗城）等处，并第一次到达尼婆罗国，即现在尼泊尔的首都加德满都。
    六四一年，唐太宗派李义表出使印度，路经尼国，受到国王那陵提婆的优礼相待，并陪同他观看都城东南的阿耆婆濔池（这个池在玄奘的“大唐西域记”里也有记载）。自此以后，中尼使节交往不绝。六四七年，尼婆罗国使者到长安，献波棱、酢菜、浑提葱等礼物；四年后当唐高宗永徽二年（六五一年），尼国又遣使来聘。唐室也在六五六年，派遣王玄策使印，并访问尼国，到了现在的加德满都。
    七世纪中叶，高僧玄照开创了经由西藏、尼泊尔到印度的通道，当时称为“吐蕃尼婆罗道”。这条道路比过去取道天山南北路、翻越葱岭转赴印度的道路便捷得多。玄照在六五四年九月离开印境的毗舍离，道经尼婆罗国回国，于次年正月就到达洛阳。这是历史上中印两国行程最便捷的一种纪录。继玄照之后往来中国、印度的僧人，如玄太（新罗人）、道希、道方、道生、末底僧诃（师子慧）、玄会、慧轮等，都经由这条道路，访问了尼国，有的人并死在尼国。
    由于迦维罗卫城跟拘夷那竭城是释迦牟尼诞生和圆寂之地，这两个地方就常成为西行求法巡礼的佛教徒瞻仰的目标。在中国文献中凡是留有入印纪行的僧人，绝大部分都到过尼泊尔。例如七二九年回到安西的慧超，著有“往五天竺国记”。这部书在炖煌发现，已残缺不全，但留存下来的这部分首先就叙述他到拘尸那国、后又到迦毗耶罗（即迦维罗卫）的情况。七五○年赴印、七六四年访问了尼泊尔境内、七九○年才回国的悟空，在贞元年间把他的行迹口授沙门圆照，写在所译的“十力经”的序文里。在这许多僧人的记述中，都称道尼国朝野对中国佛教徒的礼待，并盛赞尼泊尔的艺术和建筑。这些著作和中国史书上关于尼婆罗国的叙述，不仅记载了中尼两国悠久的友好关系，并且为研究尼泊尔中古时期的历史保留了不少可贵的资料。
    尼泊尔和我国西藏紧邻，因之尼泊尔和我国西藏人民之间的关系也最为密切。在频繁和友好的交往中，我国文化传入了尼泊尔，同时也吸收了尼泊尔的许多文化成果。拉萨市布达拉宫堡垒式的宫殿的建筑形式，起初就是来自尼国。西藏境内还有不少艺匠是尼泊尔人。六世纪末，西藏建立了绕萨神殿，供奉自尼国输入的佛像，是为西藏有佛寺之始，这就是拉萨市内一般所称的“大抬神殿”，至今还常有尼泊尔佛教徒前来朝礼。
    宋、元两代，中尼两国仍有来往。九六四年，宋太祖派继业等三百沙门赴印度，九七五年回国。继业归程即取道尼国，经过了拘尸那城和多罗聚落等地。一二六○年，元朝的八思巴在西藏建立金塔，尼国选派艺匠八十人来藏修造，其中监修的人叫阿尼哥，善于画塑和铸造金像。一二六一年塔成之后，阿尼哥即随八思巴来到北京，塑铸佛像，“凡两京寺观之像，多出其手”。此后，他曾做元朝的光禄大夫，大司徒，专门管理建筑铸造的事。阿尼哥有六个儿子，有一个承袭了他的大司徒职衔，另一个在诸色人匠（即各种艺匠）总管府供职，继承了他的父亲的职业。阿尼哥的画塑铸造的艺术还传授了一个中国人刘元。刘元跟阿尼哥学习塑铸西天梵相，在当时被称为“绝艺”。
    中尼两国第二度交往频繁是在明代。一三八四年，明太祖派高僧智光往使尼国，尼国国王马纳罗摩随即派使报聘，一三九一年到达北京，一三九四年又来聘。此后一些年，两国使节往来不断。明成祖时，曾先后派遣智光、杨三保、邓诚三次出使尼国，每一次尼国都遣使回聘。明宣宗时又曾派侯显往使尼国。
    近数百年来，中尼两国的人民遭受外族的压迫和受帝国主义的侵略，两国的友好来往受到许多阻碍。十九世纪初，英国入侵印度之后，又侵略尼泊尔，更进而对我国西藏怀着侵略的野心。为此，英国就蓄意挑拨中尼双方的关系，并于十九世纪五十年代在中尼两国之间制造冲突。但是，中国人民和尼泊尔人民的友好关系，却随着时代而更加发展、更加密切了。特别是中尼两国邻近地区的人民，亲密地相互来往，相互通商贸易，相互朝礼佛迹。我国西藏境内还有许多尼泊尔侨民居住着，和我国人民的关系一直是友好和睦的。
    中华人民共和国成立以后，中尼两国人民一千五百年来悠久的友谊得到了进一步发展的条件。我国政府一向重视同亚洲邻国和其他国家的和平友好合作。去年九月二十三日，周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中表示，我国准备同尼泊尔建立外交关系。这一声明得到了尼泊尔政府和人民的欢迎。尼泊尔首都加德满都的著名人士并发起和组成了尼中友好协会，积极促进两国人民的友谊。尼泊尔国家民主党的全国委员会在去年十二月二十八日通过决议，支持中、印、缅等国所创导的和平共处的五项原则。尼泊尔王国政府参加亚非会议的代表团，又一再表示支持五项原则作为扩大亚非国家间合作的基础。在遵循五项原则的基础上，中尼两国在今年七月圆满地进行了建交谈判。两国政府在八月一日发表的关于建立正常外交关系的联合公报中并表示：双方政府相信两国间外交关系的建立也将促进两国间文化和经济合作的进一步发展。
    具有悠久的深厚友谊的中尼两国人民，都为两国建立了正常外交关系而感到欢欣鼓舞。尼泊尔国大党主席毕·普·柯伊拉腊和民族国大党主席雷格米，都发表了声明，欢迎中尼两国建立外交关系。我国人民对于中尼两国友好关系获得新的发展表示热烈的祝贺。正如袁仲贤大使向尼泊尔人民所说的：“我们两国的关系在和平共处的五项原则的指导下，必将大大有助于两国人民的繁荣和幸福。”
