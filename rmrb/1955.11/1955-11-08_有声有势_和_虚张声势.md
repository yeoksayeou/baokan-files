In many villages of Wuchuan County, Guangdong Province, in order to quickly establish agricultural production cooperatives, they neglected detailed ideological mobilization work in planning and cooperative establishment, and were satisfied with holding large-scale meetings with numerous participants, stirring up the masses to sign up for the cooperatives. They believed that this was "resounding and impressive, capable of quickly resolving problems."

As a result, some well-to-do middle peasants who were not willing to join the cooperatives were reluctantly "pushed" into the agricultural production cooperatives. Because some people were not genuinely willing, they encountered many difficulties when evaluating the production materials for joining the cooperative. In Shibu Township, where 54% of the well-to-do middle peasants had joined the cooperatives, almost every cooperative encountered situations where the evaluation of production materials was only partially completed. Well-to-do middle peasants wanted to evaluate their land's yield as much higher than the yield of other people's equivalent land; they wanted to retain more than twice as much land for private use as others. Naturally, other cooperative members were dissatisfied with this, and the cooperative establishment work was bound to be prolonged, and even after completion, it would not be easy to consolidate. Facts have proved that if in-depth and detailed ideological mobilization work is not carried out, the so-called "resounding and impressive" is nothing but "bluster"; "bluster" cannot "quickly resolve" problems, but will create more problems.

### “有声有势”和“虚张声势”

    “有声有势”和“虚张声势”
    广东省吴川县许多乡，为了赶快把农业生产合作社建立起来，在规划工作中和建社工作中忽视了细致的思想发动工作，而满足于召开人数众多的大会，轰动群众报名入社。他们认为这样子才“有声有势，能够迅速解决问题”。
    这样做的结果，有些并不自愿入社的富裕中农被勉强地“轰”进了农业生产合作社。因为有些人不是真正自愿的，到评议入社的生产资料的时候，就碰到了很多困难。百分之五十四的富裕中农都入社的石埠乡，几乎每个社在评议生产资料的时候都有评半截评不下去的情况。富裕中农要把自己的土地比别人同等土地的产量评高很多；留地要比别人多一倍多。这样，别的社员当然不满意，建社工作就势必要拖长，建成以后也不容易巩固。事实证明：如果不进行深入的细致的思想发动工作，所谓“有声有势”只不过是“虚张声势”；“虚张声势”就不能使问题“迅速解决”，却会弄出更多的问题来。
