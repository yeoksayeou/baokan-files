The great achievements made by the Chinese people in socialist construction and the promulgation of the First Five-Year Plan for the development of the national economy have greatly inspired the patriotic enthusiasm of children. Recently, children in Beijing, Yixing County in Jiangsu Province, and Songshu District in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, held gatherings of children's representatives from the city, county, and district. They proposed to carry out "Small Five-Year Plan" activities among children, to do something beneficial for the Five-Year Plan, such as: cultivating plants, raising animals, helping agricultural production cooperatives and families with work, etc. We believe that this proposal is very good, and it is a manifestation of Chinese children's love for the motherland and socialism. This activity is interesting and within the capabilities of children. In the past, children have done many beneficial things for the motherland. This "Small Five-Year Plan" activity is a more organized and planned continuation on the basis of the past, which will enable children to be better educated from this activity. Therefore, we should strongly support this initiative and call on all children over the age of nine in the country to participate in the "Small Five-Year Plan" activities. Through this activity, we can cultivate children's patriotism and socialist labor views, and enable them to learn practical production knowledge and skills in labor. At the same time, it will also increase some wealth for the country. There are still two years left in the period of China's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. In these two years, if every child over the age of nine in the country plants one sunflower each year, and each sunflower yields four ounces of sunflower seeds, it will increase the production of sunflower seeds by 38 million catties for the country. The oil extracted can feed 1.6 million people for a year. If every rural child picks up two catties of grain each year, 212 million catties of grain can be picked up in two years, which can supply more than 7 million people for a month.

The activity of children doing beneficial things for the motherland is named "Small Five-Year Plan" because it reflects the children's good wishes to help the First Five-Year Plan, and makes the children's public welfare labor more closely connected with the First Five-Year Plan, which has greater appeal and encouragement for children. At the same time, through the formulation of the "Small Five-Year Plan", children can also learn to make simple plans and implement plans. However, it should be pointed out that the children's "Small Five-Year Plan" is different from the national Five-Year Plan. Carrying out "Small Five-Year Plan" activities among children across the country does not mean formulating national or provincial "Small Five-Year Plans" from top to bottom and requiring children to realize them, but rather formulating simple, feasible plans based on local conditions as content for after-school activities, taking schools as the unit. This plan does not require being systematic or comprehensive. Organized out-of-school children can also formulate simple plans based on their conditions.

Second, the content of the "Small Five-Year Plan" activities can generally include the following six items: cultivating plants (such as planting sunflowers, castor beans, planting trees and collecting tree seeds, etc.); raising animals (such as raising chickens, raising ducks, etc.); helping agricultural production cooperatives and families with work (such as picking up grain, accumulating fertilizer, catching pests and harmful birds, promoting new varieties, etc.); helping schools make simple teaching experimental supplies (such as collecting specimens, making models, instruments, etc.); greening the environment and greening schools (such as planting trees and flowers in front of and behind villages, by rivers, roadsides, around residences, and around schools, etc.); being "little teachers" and acting as an auxiliary force to help the Party and the government do literacy work (such as teaching parents and neighbors to read, reading newspapers to literacy classes, etc.).

Various places can choose feasible things from them, or other locally feasible things to do, according to local conditions. In order to better mobilize and organize children to participate in this activity, primary and secondary schools in various places can hold school-wide children's congresses, and the Communist Youth League committees of various cities and counties can hold representative meetings of Young Pioneers from the city and county to elaborate on the significance of this activity, give play to the children's enthusiasm, and discuss and plan the methods of this activity.

Third, the "Small Five-Year Plan" activity is one of the contents of extracurricular activities. Its main purpose is to educate children. Therefore, the main achievement of the activity does not lie in how many numbers the children complete, but in whether there is a good educational effect. It is necessary to prevent the tendency of being ambitious and greedy. When carrying out activities, it is necessary to take care of the children's physical conditions and age characteristics, and carry out activities in spare time and under the guidance of adults, so as not to hinder their studies and health; pay attention to the different conditions of cities and villages, and do not put too high and too many unrealistic demands on children. The plan must be simple, practical, and feasible. What can be done, what is planned. How much can be done, how much is planned. In order to cooperate with the implementation of production labor education in primary schools, the "Small Five-Year Plan" activities carried out by primary school students should be closely combined with teaching work; in the activities, attention should be paid to giving play to the initiative and creativity of children, and cultivating their collectivist spirit.

The "Small Five-Year Plan" activity is a long-term and regular activity. Therefore, it should not be regarded as a temporary shock task, and do not pursue numbers, but also prevent the tendency of not making plans and not finishing what is started. The labor results of children, except for some that can be dedicated to the country, can be used as their collective funds for ordering books and newspapers and adding cultural and sports supplies. If it is the harvest of children's decentralized labor in the family, it can be used to buy books, stationery, or subsidize the family.

Fourth, the Communist Youth League organizations, education administrative departments, and schools in various places should regard guiding children to carry out "Small Five-Year Plan" activities as an important task of their own, and plan the steps and methods for carrying out this activity. At the same time, they should also invite the local agricultural and forestry departments to give children the necessary technical guidance, and consult with the supply and marketing cooperatives in various places to purchase the children's products. The Communist Youth League organizations, education administrative departments, and schools in various places should also conduct a summary every six months or a year, and the summary method should be lively and interesting (such as holding harvest exhibitions, giving sunflowers to the motherland, etc.).

### 青年团中央和教育部关于支持全国少年儿童开展“小五年计划”活动的联合指示

    青年团中央和教育部关于支持全国少年儿童开展“小五年计划”活动的联合指示
    一、我国人民在社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就，和发展国民经济的第一个五年计划的公布，大大鼓舞了少年儿童的爱国热情。最近，北京市、江苏省宜兴县、辽宁省复县松树区的小朋友，都举行了市、县、区的少年儿童代表的集会。他们倡议在小朋友中开展“小五年计划”的活动，为五年计划做些有益的事情，例如：栽培植物、饲养动物、帮助农业生产合作社和家庭做事等等。我们认为这一倡议非常好，它正是我国少年儿童热爱祖国、热爱社会主义的表现。这一活动是少年儿童感兴趣的和力所能及的，过去，少年儿童已经为祖国做了许多有益的事情，这次“小五年计划”的活动，就是在过去的基础上，更有组织更有计划地进行，它将使少年儿童更好地从这一活动中受到教育。因此，我们应该大力支持这一倡议，并且号召全国九周岁以上的小朋友参加“小五年计划”的活动。通过这
  一活动，我们可以培养少年儿童的爱国主义思想、社会主义劳动观点，并且可以使他们在劳动中学到实际的生产知识与技能，同时还将为祖国增加一些财富。我国实行第一个五年计划的时期还有两年，这两年中，如果全国九周岁以上的小朋友每人每年种一棵向日葵，每棵收四两葵花子，则将为祖国增产葵花子三千八百万斤，榨出的油可供一百六十万人吃一年，如果每年每个农村小朋友拣回二斤粮食，两年中则可拣回二亿一千二百万斤粮食，可以供给七百多万人吃一个月。
    把少年儿童为祖国做有益的事情的活动，定名为“小五年计划”，是因为它反映了少年儿童帮助第一个五年计划的美好愿望，使少年儿童的公益劳动和第一个五年计划更紧密地联系起来，对少年儿童有更大的号召和鼓动的力量；同时通过“小五年计划”的制定，也可以使少年儿童学习订简单的计划和执行计划。但是，应当指出：少年儿童的“小五年计划”和国家的五年计划是有区别的。在全国少年儿童中开展“小五年计划”的活动，并不是要自上而下地订出全国或全省的“小五年计划”，要求少年儿童来实现，而是以学校为单位，根据当地的条件，订出切实可行的简单计划作为课余活动的内容。这种计划并不要求系统或全面。有组织的校外少年儿童，也可以根据他们的条件来制定简单的计划。
    二、“小五年计划”的活动内容，一般可以有以下六项：栽培植物（如种向日葵、蓖麻、植树采集树种等）；饲养动物（如养鸡、养鸭等）；帮助农业生产合作社和家庭做事（如拣粮食、积肥、捕捉害虫害鸟、推广新品种等）；帮助学校制作简单的教学实验用品（如采集标本、制造模型、仪器等）；绿化环境绿化学校（如在村前村后，河边，路旁，住宅周围和学校周围种树、栽花等）；做“小先生”，做为一个辅助力量帮助党和政府做扫除文盲工作（如教爸爸妈妈和邻居识字，给识字班读报等）。
    各地可以因地制宜，选择其中可行的事情，或其他当地可行的事情来做。为了更好地动员和组织少年儿童参加这一活动，各地中小学可以召开全校少年儿童大会，各市、县团委可以召开全市县少先队员代表会议，阐述这一活动的意义，发挥少年儿童的积极性，讨论和规划这一活动的办法。
    三、“小五年计划”活动是课外活动的内容之一，其主要目的是对少年儿童进行教育，因此活动成绩主要不在于少年儿童完成数字多少，而在于是否有良好的教育效果。要防止好高骛远贪多的偏向。在进行活动的时候，必须照顾少年儿童体力条件和年龄特点，并且在课余时间和成人指导下进行，不得妨碍他们的功课和健康；要注意城市、乡村的不同条件，不要向少年儿童提出过高过多的不切实际的要求。计划务必订得简单、切实可行，能做什么，计划里就订什么。能做多少，计划里就订多少。为配合小学的生产劳动教育的实施，小学学生所进行的“小五年计划”的活动应当紧密地与教学工作相结合；在活动中要注意发挥少年儿童的主动性和创造性，培养他们的集体主义精神。
      “小五年计划”的活动是一个长时期的经常性的活动，因此，不应当把它当作临时性的突击任务，不要追求数字，但是也要防止不订计划、有始无终的偏向。少年儿童的劳动成果，除某些可以献给国家以外，其他的可以作为他们集体订购书报、添置文化体育用品的经费。如系少年儿童分散在家庭劳动的收获，则可以作为自己购买书报、文具或补助家庭之用。
    四、各地青年团组织、教育行政部门和学校应当将指导少年儿童开展“小五年计划”活动作为自己的一项重要工作，规划开展这一活动的步骤和办法。同时还应当邀请当地农林部门给予少年儿童以必要的技术指导，商请各地供销合作社对少年儿童的产品予以收购。各地青年团组织、教育行政部门和学校还应当每半年或一年进行一次总结，总结的方式应当生动有趣（如举行丰收展览会、给祖国献向日葵会等等）。一九五五年十一月二十七日
