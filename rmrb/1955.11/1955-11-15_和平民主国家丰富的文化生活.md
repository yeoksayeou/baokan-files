　　Rich Cultural Life in Peaceful and Democratic Countries
　　Kuybyshev Television Center
　　In Kuybyshev, the capital of the Bashkir Republic, the establishment of a television center has begun. A three-story building will house television studios, performance halls, rehearsal rooms, and other facilities. The entire television center will be equipped with the latest Soviet equipment. At the same time, a 200-meter-high television tower will also be built.
　　This television center is scheduled to be completed in 1956. At that time, it will be able to broadcast television programs from various cities in the Soviet Union.
　　A Village's Cultural Life
　　"Where are you going tonight?"—In every family in Dashkova Village, Mogilev Province, Belarus, one can almost always hear this question. After work each day, some people go to see new movies, some go to listen to lectures, some go to the reading room to read newspapers and books, and art lovers go to participate in amateur art activities on time.
　　To meet the cultural needs of the villagers, three clubs have been established here. Each club screens a movie every other day, with content covering agricultural techniques, art, and scientific knowledge. All the libraries in the village—village, collective farm, school, and other libraries—collectively hold more than 40,000 copies of books on politics, art, agriculture, medicine, and education. The villagers subscribe to a total of 800 newspapers and 250 magazines. More than 1,000 children of collective farmers and stud farm workers are studying in the village's ten-year school and night school.
　　Dashkova Village has been completely electrified and equipped with radios. An automated telephone station was also recently established here.
　　In the New Theatrical and Musical Season
　　The winter theater and music season has already begun in Romania. The Bucharest Opera and Ballet Theatre staged the Italian composer Verdi's opera "Aida." This famous opera has been performed many times in Romania. Among those participating in this opera performance are outstanding singers, meritorious actors, and meritorious artists. The collaboration of these outstanding artists made the performance a great success.
　　The Bucharest Opera and Ballet Theatre is scheduled to continue performing Rossini's opera "The Barber of Seville," Puccini's "Madame Butterfly," and the Soviet ballet "The Fountain of Bakhchisarai."
　　The Bucharest National Theatre staged Shakespeare's "King Lear" at the beginning of the theater season. This play has not been performed in Romania for many years. This performance reached a high artistic level.
　　Plays for Children
　　In Czechoslovakia, in addition to the eleven professional puppet theaters and sixteen touring troupes that perform exclusively for children, there are also three professional theaters in Prague, Brno, and Ostrava. In the upcoming theater season, these three theaters will stage classical and modern dramas by Czechoslovak and foreign writers for children.
　　The Brno Theatre will stage the script "Brave Youth" describing the youth in the First World War and Bozena Němcová's fairy tale play "Prince Bayaya." The Prague Theatre will prepare to stage Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night."

　　和平民主国家丰富的文化生活
    古比雪夫的电视中心
    在巴什基利共和国的首都古比雪夫，已经开始建立一个电视中心。在一座三层楼高的大厦里，将设置电视室、表演室、排演室和其他场所。整个电视中心都将装置苏联最新的设备。同时还要建立一座高达二百公尺的电视铁塔。
    这个电视中心预定要在一九五六年建设完成。那时，它将能放映苏联各个城市的电视节目。
    一个乡村的文化生活
    “今天晚上你上哪儿去？”——在白俄罗斯的莫吉辽夫省达什科瓦乡村的每一个家庭里，人们几乎都能够听到这样的问题。每天工作完毕以后，有的人去看新的电影片，有的去听演讲，有的到阅览室去阅读书报，艺术爱好者们则按时地去参加业余艺术活动。
    为了满足本村居民的文化需要，这里已设立了三个俱乐部。每一个俱乐部隔天放映一次电影，影片的内容有农业技术的、艺术的和科学知识的。在全村所有的图书馆——村的、集体农庄的、学校的以及其他的图书馆里，共藏有四万多册政治、艺术、农业、医学和教育等各方面的书籍。全村的居民共订阅了八百份报纸和二百五十份杂志。在村里的十年制学校和夜校里念书的有一千多个集体农民和养马场工人的子女。
    达什科瓦乡村已经完全电气化和无线电化了。不久以前这里又建立了一个自动化的电话站。
    在新的戏剧音乐季节里
    冬令的戏剧和音乐季已经在罗马尼亚开始了。布加勒斯特的歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院上演了意大利作曲家浮第的歌剧“阿伊达”。这部著名的歌剧在罗马尼亚曾经上演过多次。参加这次歌剧演出的人当中有杰出的歌唱家、功勋演员和功勋艺术家。这些杰出的艺术家们的合作，使演出得到了很大的成功。
    布加勒斯特歌剧和巴蕾舞剧院预定要继续演出的，还有罗西尼的歌剧“塞维尔理发师”、普契尼的“蝴蝶夫人”和苏联的巴蕾舞剧“巴赫切萨拉伊喷泉”。
    布加勒斯特国家剧院在戏剧季开始时上演了莎士比亚的“李尔王”。这个剧在罗马尼亚已经有多年没有演出了。这次的演出达到了很高的艺术水平。
    演给孩子们看的戏
    在捷克斯洛伐克，除了专为儿童们演出的十一个专业性的木偶剧院、十六个巡回剧团外，还在布拉格、布尔诺和俄斯特拉发设有三个专业剧院。在即将到来的戏剧季节里，这三座剧院将为孩子们演出捷克斯洛伐克作家和外国作家们的古典和现代戏剧。
    布尔诺剧院将上演描述第一次世界大战中的青年的剧本“勇敢青年”和波兹纳·涅姆索娃的童话剧“巴雅雅王子”。布拉格剧院将准备上演莎士比亚的“第十二夜”。
