Xinhua News Agency, October 31st. The Centenary Commemoration of the birth of the great transformer of nature, I.V. Michurin, jointly organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies, closed on the 31st, after holding panel discussions for several days to discuss scientific papers collected by nine natural science specialized societies on the achievements of studying and applying Michurin's theory.

    Academician Yudin of the Soviet Union was invited to attend the meeting and delivered a speech. He thanked the Chinese scientific workers for their high evaluation of Michurin's theory, saying that this evaluation also reflects the direction of Chinese scientific workers, who are advancing along Michurin's path to transform nature and benefit mankind. He believes this is another manifestation of Soviet-Chinese friendship. He said that the Soviet people are deeply gratified that Michurin's theory is being practiced not only among Chinese scientists but also among Chinese farmers and in agricultural producers' cooperatives. He said that the Soviet people are equally deeply gratified that in Chinese scientific circles, the materialistic Michurin theory is overcoming bourgeois idealist thought. He said that Soviet scientists and all Soviet people will continue to advance together with Chinese scientists and the Chinese people, fighting for science, for the welfare of the people of the Soviet Union and China, and for lasting peace for mankind. In his speech, Academician Yudin also clarified the great significance of Michurin's theory in the development of biology.

    After Academician Yudin's speech, Guo Moruo, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, made a guarantee on behalf of Chinese scientific workers, saying: We must better study Michurin's theory and the advanced science of the Soviet Union to serve the socialist construction of our motherland. Guo Moruo said: We must strengthen creative cooperation with Soviet scientific workers and jointly accomplish the great mission of defending world peace and human happiness.

    Zhang Jingyue, member of the Department of Biology and Earth Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, spoke on behalf of the various discussion groups, focusing on criticizing the bourgeois ideas that still exist in the scientific community, such as undervaluing the national scientific and cultural heritage, despising the working people, and obliterating the scientific achievements made under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government after liberation.

    Representatives of the various discussion groups also reported to the conference on the discussion situation during the commemoration. Everyone unanimously and enthusiastically criticized the fact that individual scientific workers deliberately distorted and belittled the significance of Michurin's theory in their works, and distorted the Communist Party's correct policy on scientific undertakings. Everyone believes that the erroneous nature of this kind of thinking is extremely serious, and that this kind of thinking will seriously hinder our study and research of Michurin's theory and cause damage to our scientific and revolutionary cause.

    Finally, Zhu Kezhen, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, delivered the closing speech. Zhu Kezhen first affirmed the achievements of Chinese scientific workers in studying and applying Michurin's theory since liberation. He said: The papers read and discussed at this meeting have certain theoretical and practical value. He asked scientific workers to further study Michurin's spirit of innovation and patriotism in practice, creatively study and apply Michurin's theory, and spread it to the vast number of farmers, so that scientific research work can adapt to the needs of the development of agricultural cooperation and better serve socialist construction.

    首都举行的米丘林诞生百周年纪念会闭幕
    新华社三十一日讯　中国科学院、中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会联合举办的伟大的自然改造者伊·弗·米丘林诞生一百周年纪念会连日举行小组会，讨论了九个自然科学专门学会征集的有关学习和应用米丘林学说成就的科学论文后，已在三十一日闭幕。
    会上，苏联尤金院士应邀出席讲话。他感谢中国科学工作者给米丘林学说的崇高评价，他说：这个评价也表现了中国科学工作者的方向，他们正沿着米丘林的道路前进，去改造自然、造福人类。他认为这是苏中友谊的又一种表现。他说：苏联人民深深感到喜悦的是米丘林的学说不仅在中国的科学家中间，而且已经在中国的农民中间，在农业生产合作社中间实践。他说：苏联人民同样深深喜悦的是在中国科学界，唯物主义的米丘林学说正在战胜着资产阶级唯心主义思想。他说：苏联的科学家和全体苏联人民，将同中国科学家、中国人民一道继续前进，为科学、为苏中两国人民的福利、为人类的持久和平而斗争。尤金院士并在讲话中阐明了米丘林学说在生物学发展中的巨大意义。
    尤金院士讲话后，中国科学院院长郭沫若代表中国科学工作者提出保证说：我们一定要更好地学习米丘林的学说和苏联的先进科学，为祖国社会主义建设服务。郭沫若说：我们要和苏联科学工作者加强创造性的合作，共同来完成保卫世界和平和人类幸福的伟大使命。
    中国科学院生物学地学部委员张景钺代表各个讨论小组发言，着重批判了现在科学界还存在着的轻视民族科学文化遗产、卑视劳动人民、抹杀解放后在中国共产党和人民政府领导下所取得的科学成就等资产阶级思想。
    各个讨论小组的代表也向大会汇报了纪念会举行期间的讨论情况，大家一致热烈地批判了个别科学工作者在著作中别有用心地歪曲和贬低米丘林学说的意义，歪曲共产党对科学事业的正确的政策。大家认为这种思想的错误性质是极其严重的，这种思想会严重地阻碍我们学习和研究米丘林学说，使我们的科学事业和革命事业遭受损害。
    最后，中国科学院副院长竺可桢致闭幕词。竺可桢首先肯定了解放以来中国科学工作者在学习和运用米丘林学说方面的成就，他说：在这次会上宣读和讨论的论文，都有着一定的理论和实践价值。他要求科学工作者必须在实践中进一步学习米丘林的革新精神和爱国主义精神，创造性地研究和运用米丘林学说，并把它传播到广大农民中去，使科学研究工作能够适应农业合作化发展的需要，能够更好地为社会主义建设服务。
