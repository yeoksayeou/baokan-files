    A Shock Force in the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
　　Bu Keyi
    In the agricultural cooperative movement, the Communist Youth League organization of Xianyang County fully exerted its role as an assistant to the Party, becoming a strong shock force. Over 95 percent of the League members in the county joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, among whom 816 joined agricultural production cooperatives, and 325 also became directors, committee members, and team leaders of the cooperatives. After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people rose even higher. They used various forms of propaganda to promote the Party's cooperative policies and the benefits of cooperation to the peasants. In the First District, 206 young people organized 24 propaganda teams to carry out propaganda among the peasants. League members in Wangche Village, Fourth District, rehearsed the drama "Spring Blossoms" to promote cooperation. These propaganda efforts played a role in promoting the development of the movement.
    This spring, after the Xianyang County Party Committee issued instructions to vigorously consolidate existing cooperatives, the County Communist Youth League Committee organized rural League members and young people throughout the county to hold discussions on "Striving to Be an Excellent Cooperative Member." Closely combining the ideological conditions of League members and young people, they carried out a vivid socialist education of patriotism, love for the cooperative, and love for labor, generally raising the socialist consciousness of League members and young people. Soon, many outstanding young cooperative members emerged in the cooperative movement. In the "May First" First Cooperative and the "Xiaoguang" First Cooperative, eleven League members and young people were评委评为评为模范社员.
    One of the difficulties in establishing cooperatives was the lack of accounting talent. The business level of the existing cooperative accountants was very low, and they often made mistakes in accounting, causing dissatisfaction among the members. The Xianyang County Communist Youth League Committee paid attention to the work of training accounting personnel. Xu Kechuang (a League member), an accountant at the Xujiazhai Cooperative in the Third District, had only two years of schooling and often made mistakes in accounting. After studying, his business level greatly improved. Now he is the leader of the accounting team in Majia Township and has been rated as a model cooperative member. The League organization also organized 25 accounting study groups to train new accountants and work recorders to prepare for the establishment of new cooperatives. The members participating in the accounting study groups were all junior and senior primary school graduates recommended by the villages where cooperatives were to be established. According to statistics from the twelve accounting study groups in the Third and Sixth Districts alone, 28 accountants have been trained. This work has won high praise from the masses. They said: "The cooperative hasn't been established yet, but the accountants are ready."
    Many League members and young people often reflected the opinions of the masses to the Party organization. The administrative committee of the "Xiaoguang" First Cooperative in the Sixth District stipulated that hauling a cart of dry soil and a cart of wet soil should be calculated as one and a half work points. As a result, everyone went to haul wet soil, and no one hauled dry soil. The League group held a meeting to study this issue and found that the reason for not hauling dry soil was that wet soil could be dumped and finished, while dry soil had to be dumped into the pen, which was more labor-intensive. The League group reflected this situation to the administrative committee, and the cooperative leaders studied it and decided to increase the work points for hauling dry soil to 1.8. In this way, both dry and wet soil were hauled. This League group submitted a total of sixteen rationalization proposals to the administrative committee within half a year, and thirteen of them have been adopted. Cooperative director Feng Baolin often praised them, saying:
  "These young lads in our cooperative not only work well but are also very concerned about the cooperative's affairs. If everyone can be like this, the cooperative will definitely be run well." In the "May First" First Cooperative, due to unreasonable internal regulations, the members' enthusiasm for production was not high, and labor efficiency was very low. Once, fourteen members went to pull sesame stalks in the field and only pulled 1.2 mu of land in more than three hours. League member Wu Hongzhu discussed with everyone and implemented the practice of each person pulling a piece, with assigned tasks and responsibilities. As a result, the remaining 1.3 mu of land was cleared in only thirty minutes. The administrative committee, based on his suggestion, established a "fixed quality, fixed quantity, and fixed time" small contracting system, which solved a major problem in production. The youth inspection group under the leadership of the Party branch and the administrative committee also played a significant role. For example, the "Liaoyuan" First Cooperative in the Fourth District found that the livestock were thin. The youth inspection group convened its members to study the reasons, put forward solutions, and wrote down the precautions for feeding on posters, which were posted in the four feeding rooms to draw the attention of the feeders. During wheat planting, the inspection team inspected the seed selection work and found that many seeds were not selected according to specifications, which drew everyone's attention. Cooperative director Guo Chongwen said: "The youth inspection group is serious in its work and has been of great help to the cooperative."
    League members in Xianyang County also played a leading role in promoting advanced agricultural production experience. For example, this year, the county promoted the advanced experience of artificial pollination of corn, but at the beginning, the masses did not believe it. They said, "Can production be increased by cutting off the top of the corn?" The County Communist Youth League Committee organized 132 corn artificial pollination shock teams with more than 3,000 young people to lead the peasant masses in completing more than 11,700 mu of corn artificial pollination work. According to preliminary statistics, corn production can be increased by more than 235,000 jin. This autumn, the Xianyang County Party Committee instructed to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign, and the youth also took the lead. About 3,400 young people in the county organized fertilizer accumulation and composting teams and put forward the slogan "Marching towards green grass." According to statistics from the Second and Third Districts, League members and the masses searched for and composted 120,000 cartloads of fertilizer and green manure. The masses called League members "pioneers."
    Now, the rural youth of the entire county are further studying the tasks of the youth in the agricultural cooperative movement, preparing to devote all their energy and wisdom to the upsurge of the agricultural cooperative movement through this study.

    农业合作化运动中的一支突击力量
　　卜克义
    在农业合作化运动中，咸阳县的青年团组织充分发挥了党的助手作用，成为一支坚强的突击力量。全县百分之九十五以上的团员都加入了互助合作组织，其中有八百一十六人入了农业生产合作社，有三百二十五人还当了社的主任、委员和组长。学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的指示后，广大青年建设社会主义热情更加高涨，他们运用各种宣传方式向农民宣传党的合作化政策和合作化的好处。一区二百零六个青年组织了二十四个宣传组，分头向农民进行宣传。四区王车村团员排演了宣传合作化的“春暖花开”的戏剧。这些宣传工作对运动的开展都起了推动作用。
    今年春季，中共咸阳县委发出要大力巩固现有合作社的指示后，县团委便组织全县农村青年团员和青年群众分别举行了关于“争取做个优秀社员”的讨论会，密切结合团员和青年群众的思想状况，进行了一次生动的爱国、爱社、爱劳动的社会主义教育，普遍地提高了团员和青年群众的社会主义觉悟。不久，在合作化运动中出现了不少青年优秀社员。“五一”第一合作社和“晓光”第一合作社，就有十一个团员和青年群众被评为模范社员。
    建社中的困难之一是缺乏会计人材。现有的合作社的会计人员的业务水平很低，时常记错账，引起社员的不满。咸阳县团委注意了培养会计人员的工作。三区徐家寨合作社会计徐克创（团员）只念过两年书，时常记错账。经过学习，业务水平大大提高，现在当了马家乡会计组的组长，并被评为模范社员。团组织还组织了二十五个会计学习小组，培养新的会计和记工员，为新建社作好准备工作。参加会计学习小组的成员都是建社村推荐的初中和高小毕业生。仅就三、六区十二个会计学习小组统计，已训练出会计二十八名。这一工作深得群众的称赞。他们说：“社还没有建立，会计就准备好了。”
    许多团员和青年群众经常向党组织反映群众的意见。六区“晓光”第一合作社社务管理委员会规定拉一车干土和一车湿土都以一分半工计算，结果，大家都去拉湿土，没人拉干土。团小组开会研究了这个问题，发现不拉干土的原因是：湿土拉回一倒就完事，干土还要倒到圈里去，比较费力。团小组便把这个情况反映给社务管理委员会，社领导上进行了研究，就决定将拉干土工分提高到一分八。这样干土湿土都有人拉。这个团小组，半年内共向社务管理委员会提出了十六条合理化建议，已被采纳了十三件。社主任冯宝林常常夸奖他们，说：
  “咱社内这些年轻小伙子，不仅作活好，还很关心社里的事情，大家都能这样，社一定能办好。”“五一”第一合作社，由于社内制度不合理，社员生产情绪不高，劳动效率很低。有一次，十四个社员去拔地里的芝麻秆，三小时多才拔了一亩二分地。团员吴宏柱就同大家研究，实行每人拔一片，分工包干。结果，留下的一亩三分地，只用三十分钟就拔光了。社务管理委员会又根据他的建议建立了“定质、定量、定时”的小包工制，解决了生产上的一个重大问题。党支部和社务管理委员会领导下的青年检查组，也起了很大的作用。如四区“燎原”第一合作社发现牲口瘦了，青年检查组召集组员研究出了原因，提出了办法，而且把饲养时应注意的事项写成标语贴在四个饲养室内，以引起饲养员的注意。在种麦时，检查小组发现饲养处没青草，全组组员自动地帮助铡草。在播种中，检查小组检查选种工作，发现有许多种子选得不合规格，这就引起了大家的注意。社主任郭崇文说：“青年检查组办事认真，给社的帮助很大。”
    咸阳县的团员在推广先进农业生产经验中也起了带头作用。如今年全县推广玉米人工授粉先进经验，开始群众都不相信。他们说：“把玉米头割掉了还能增产？”县团委组织了有三千多青年参加的一百三十二个玉米人工授粉突击队，带动农民群众完成了一万一千七百多亩玉米人工授粉工作。据初步统计，可增产玉米二十三万五千多斤。今年秋季，中共咸阳县委指示展开积肥运动，青年也走在前面。全县约有三千四百名青年组织了积肥、沤肥小组，并提出了“向青草进军”的口号。据二区、三区统计，团员和群众一道搜肥沤绿肥达十二万车。群众称团员为：“开路先锋”。
    现在，全县农村青年正在进一步学习农业合作化运动中青年的任务，准备通过这次学习，把自己全部的精力和智慧投入农业合作化运动的高潮中去。
