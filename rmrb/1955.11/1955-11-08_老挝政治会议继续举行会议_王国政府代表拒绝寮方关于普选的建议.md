Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 7th: Lao news: The Lao political conference was held on the 4th with the participation of representatives from the International Commission for Laos.

    At the meeting, the political delegation of the Royal Government of Laos issued a statement on the issue of the general election, rejecting the reasonable proposals of the Lao Fighting Units regarding the general election. The Royal Government of Laos representatives said that the Royal Government had studied the proposals of the Lao Fighting Units and could not make any concessions on the issues raised by the Lao Fighting Units, such as the Lao Fighting Units participating in the joint supervision of elections by the Supervisory Committee, extending the deadline for submitting candidate lists and campaigning, women's participation in elections, and relaxing the age and education restrictions on candidates.

    Regarding the issue of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces, the Royal Government of Laos representatives said that the Royal Government did not agree with the Lao Fighting Units' proposal to establish a consultation committee. The Lao Fighting Units' suggestion was to establish a consultation committee so that both parties could jointly study and reach a solution for unifying Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces into the Royal government that conforms to the situation in the two provinces.

    Phoumi Vongvichit, head of the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Units, also issued a statement at the meeting. Phoumi pointed out that the Royal Government's rejection of the Lao Fighting Units' reasonable proposals regarding the general election and the resolution of the two provinces was aimed at increasing the difficulties of the political conference and holding a separate election. This practice by the Royal Government is inconsistent with the Geneva Agreement and the wishes of the Lao people. The Royal Government should be responsible for the current situation.

    老挝政治会议继续举行会议
    王国政府代表拒绝寮方关于普选的建议
    新华社河内七日电　老挝消息：老挝政治会议四日在老挝国际委员会代表的参加下举行。
    在会议上，老挝王国政府政治代表团发表了关于普选问题的声明，拒绝了寮国战斗部队方面有关普选的合理建议。老挝王国政府代表说，王国政府已经研究过寮国战斗部队方面的建议，对于寮国战斗部队方面提出的寮国战斗部队方面参加监察委员会共同监察选举、延长提出竞选人名单和竞选活动截止日期、妇女参加选举、放宽候选人的年龄和文化程度的限制等问题，王国政府不能作任何让步。
    对于丰沙里和桑怒两省问题，老挝王国政府代表说，王国政府不同意寮国战斗部队方面提出的双方成立咨询委员会的意见。寮国战斗部队方面的建议是，成立咨询委员会以便双方共同研究得出桑怒和丰沙里两省统一到王国政权之内并符合于两省情况的解决办法。
    寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长富米也在会议上发表了声明。富米指出，王国政府方面拒绝寮国战斗部队方面关于普选和解决两省问题的合理建议，其目的在于使政治会议增加困难和举行单独选举。王国政府方面这种作法是与日内瓦协议和老挝人民的愿望不符合的。王国政府方面应对目前情况负责。
