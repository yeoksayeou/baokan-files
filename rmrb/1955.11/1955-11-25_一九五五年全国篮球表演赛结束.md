Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The "1955 National Basketball Exhibition Tournament" concluded completely on the evening of the 24th.

Tonight, the Chinese People's Liberation Army "August 1st" men's and women's basketball teams played their final two exhibition matches against the Chinese People's Liberation Army Public Security Army men's basketball team and the East China Institute of Physical Education women's basketball team, respectively. Approximately six thousand spectators were present.

The women's team exhibition match was held first. During the match, the "August 1st" team, with its good physical strength, employed rapid offensive tactics and full-court, tight man-to-man defensive tactics. To counter the opponent's defensive tactics, the East China Institute of Physical Education team also successfully employed "cross screen" offensive tactics, using one player to separate the opponent's defensive players, giving another player the opportunity to shoot. As a result of this exhibition match, the "August 1st" team won with a score of 68 to 50. In the men's team match, the "August 1st" team skillfully employed rapid offensive tactics, resulting in a 113 to 81 victory over the Public Security Army team.

　　一九五五年全国篮球表演赛结束
    新华社二十四日讯　“一九五五年全国篮球表演赛”在二十四日晚全部结束。
    今天晚上，中国人民解放军“八一”男、女篮球队分别同中国人民解放军公安军男子篮球队和华东体育学院女子篮球队进行了最后的两场表演赛。到场的观众约有六千人。
    首先进行的是女子队的表演赛。在比赛中，有着良好体力的“八一”队运用了快速的进攻战术和全场紧迫人钉人的防守战术；华东体育学院队为了对付对方的防守战术，也比较成功地运用了“交叉掩护”的进攻战术，她们用一个队员隔开对方的防守队员，使另一个队员能够有机会投篮。这场表演赛的结果，“八一”队以六十八比五十获得了胜利。在男子队的比赛中，由于“八一”队熟练地运用了快速的进攻战术，结果以一百一十三比八十一战胜了公安军队。
    这次的篮球表演赛是从十一月十六日开始的。参加表演赛的男、女篮球队到今天为止，共举行了二十六场表演赛。
