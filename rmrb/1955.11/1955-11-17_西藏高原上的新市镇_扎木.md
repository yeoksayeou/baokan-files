A New Town on the Tibetan Plateau—Zhamu
Gong Jiaxiang

Zhamu is a rising city on the banks of the Palong Tsangpo River in the Bomi region of the Tibetan Plateau. This city has grown up along with the Kangzang Highway. It is 482 kilometers east of Qamdo and more than 600 kilometers west of Lhasa. Zhamu city is 2,700 meters above sea level, surrounded by continuous primeval forests, and snow-capped mountains stand like silver towers in the sea of ​​forests. To the north of Zhamu, the towering Nyainqêntanglha Mountains and the Pösungla Range block the cold currents, while the valleys of the Yarlung Tsangpo River bring warm currents from the Indian Ocean. Because of its mild climate all year round, it is known as the "Jiangnan of the Tibetan Plateau."

Last spring, Zhamu was still a plain overgrown with weeds and frequented by wild animals, with only four or five Tibetan farmers living near the foot of the mountain. Since the opening of the Kangzang Highway to Bomi, it has become a city of tens of thousands of people in just over a year.

Zhamu is divided into two parts: the north bank of the Palong Tsangpo River is the area where commerce, residents, and state organs are concentrated; the south bank is a beautiful scenic area. The engineering corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army built a bridge over the Palong Tsangpo River, tightly connecting the two parts of the city into a whole. The Kangzang Highway passes through the center of the city along the Palong Tsangpo River.

The emerging Zhamu has become a trading center and product distribution center in the Bomi area. In the Zhamu market, you can buy Chengdu's silk, Jiangxi's porcelain, and the daily necessities that Tibetan people love, such as boots, aluminum pots, and ribbons. Valuable medicinal materials such as musk and caterpillar fungus produced in various parts of Bomi also gather here. From January to August this year, the trade company sold more than 110,000 catties of tea to the Tibetan people, and wholesaled a large number of daily necessities to Tibetan merchants, who took them to the countryside to supply farmers and herdsmen.

Zhamu is an important transportation hub on the Kangzang Highway. Teams of vehicles, loaded with construction equipment, drove from the inland to here, and then transshipped from here to Lhasa. Wool, hides, and various local products produced in the vast rural areas and pastures west of Zhamu are transported from various post roads to the roadside and then transported to the inland through Zhamu. Tibetan travelers passing through Zhamu by car praised Zhamu as the most comfortable stop on the more than 1,000-kilometer section of the Kangzang Highway from Qamdo to Lhasa.

Today's Zhamu is becoming more and more prosperous day by day. The number of building scaffolds is increasing every day, and new buildings are constantly appearing. Around the city, newly built sawmills and lime kilns have started operations. In the morning, the loudspeaker sounded, and people began their day's work; in the evening, dazzling electric lights shone from the buildings and tents, and the loudspeaker broadcast news of the motherland's construction and music. In the Linka, the crisp and melodious flute sounds of the Tibetan people rang out.

The young Zhamu is developing according to the country's construction blueprint. Tens of thousands of square meters of construction area will be completed in 1955. Commercial districts, residential areas, people's squares, transportation stations, automobile maintenance plants, hospitals, trading companies, people's banks, post offices, hotels and other buildings will be rapidly established.

　　西藏高原上的新市镇——扎木
　　龚稼祥
    扎木是西藏高原波密地区泊龙藏布江畔一座新兴的城市。这座城市是和康藏公路一同生长起来的。它东距昌都四百八十二公里，西距拉萨六百多公里。扎木城拔海二千七百公尺，周围是连绵不断的原始森林，终年积雪的山峰好像银塔一样耸立在森林海洋中。在扎木的北方，高峻的念青唐古拉山和伯舒拉岭挡住了寒流，而雅鲁藏布江流域诸河谷却送来了印度洋的暖流。这里由于四季气候温和，被人们称为“西藏高原的江南”。
    去年春天，扎木还是一片杂草丛生、野兽出没的平坝，只是在靠近山脚的地方，居住着四、五户藏族农民。自从康藏公路通车到波密后，仅仅一年多的时间就已成为上万人口的城市了。
    扎木，分为两个部分：泊龙藏布江的北岸是商业、居民、国家机关集中的地区；南岸是幽美的风景区。中国人民解放军工兵部队在泊龙藏布江上架起了桥梁，把城市的两个部分紧密地结成整体。康藏公路沿泊龙藏布江通过城市的中央。
    新兴的扎木，已经成为波密地区贸易中心和产品集散地。在扎木市场上，可以买到成都的纺绸、江西的瓷器和藏族人民喜爱的靴子、铝锅、丝带等日用品。波密各地出产的麝香、虫草等珍贵药材也在这里汇集。从今年一月——八月，贸易公司就向藏族人民出售了十一万多斤茶叶，并且批发给藏族商人大批日用品，通过他们带下乡去供应农牧民。
    扎木是康藏公路一个重要的交通枢纽。成队的汽车，满载建筑器材从内地开到这里，再从这里转运到拉萨去。扎木以西广大农村、牧场出产的羊毛、皮张和各种土特产品，从各条驿道运到公路沿线，又经过扎木运往内地。藏族旅客们乘车经过扎木，都赞扬扎木是康藏公路昌都至拉萨段沿线一千多公里中最舒适的落脚点。
    今日的扎木一天比一天繁荣起来。建筑架天天增多，新的楼房在不断出现。在城市的周围，新建的锯木厂、石灰窑都已开工。早晨，扩音器响了，人们开始一天的劳动；傍晚，楼房和帐篷内透出了耀眼的电灯光，扩音器播送出祖国的建设消息和音乐。在林卡里，响起了藏胞们的清脆悦耳的笛声。
    年轻的扎木，正按着国家的建设蓝图在发展，一九五五年将完成数万公尺的建筑面积。商业区、居民住宅区、人民广场、运输站、汽车保养厂、医院、贸易公司、人民银行、邮局、旅馆等建筑物，将迅速地建立起来。
