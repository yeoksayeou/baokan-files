　　At Wuwei Railway Station
　　Guo Fenxiang
　　Three hours after the westbound train on the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway entered the Hexi Corridor, a group of newly built structures came into view. Long lines of oil tanker cars stretched across the wide station. Various passenger and freight cars were busy being marshalled, and cranes rotated their thick iron arms, hoisting machinery and steel pipes from the trains. This is Wuwei Railway Station, an important station in the Hexi Corridor.
　　Wuwei is an important city in the Hexi Corridor and a necessary stop for those traveling from the interior of the motherland to places like Yumen and Xinjiang. Wuwei Railway Station is located five *hua li* from the city. The area around the station used to be a wilderness, but since the laying of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway reached here on December 1st of last year, a large freight yard and warehouses have been rapidly constructed, and thousands of rooms have been built. A newly built main road connects the station with the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway, which in turn connects to highways leading to the Qaidam Basin, Yaburai Salt Lake, and Shandan Coal Mine. Now, cars on various highways are constantly transporting crude oil, grain, medicinal materials, furs, salt, and various local specialties to Wuwei Railway Station, and then shipping them out by train.
　　Walking into Wuwei Railway Station is like entering a small mountain range of piled-up goods. Dozens of warehouses and freight yards, distributed on both sides of the railway, stretch for as long as three *hua li* from east to west. Workers operating cranes are loading drilling rigs and tools labeled "To the Qaidam Basin" and "To Xinjiang Petroleum Corporation" onto heavy-duty trucks. The names of almost all major construction units in Xinjiang, Qinghai, and the Hexi Corridor can be found at the station. These many construction units have established transfer stations at the railway station, and they regularly use hundreds of vehicles to transport large steel materials from Anshan Iron and Steel, cement from North China, timber from Inner Mongolia, and machinery manufactured in East China to factories, mines, and resource exploration teams under construction. These many construction materials account for about half of the total tonnage of goods transported by rail.
　　The station also stockpiles hundreds of types of large agricultural and sideline products, industrial raw materials, and local specialties awaiting shipment. *Qin jiao*, *qiang huo*, *yin chai hu*, and other medicinal materials, which had been unsalable for a long time due to inconvenient transportation, have now been shipped out for more than 300,000 *jin*. More than 10 million *jin* of potatoes produced in the Hexi Corridor have also been loaded onto trains and sold to places like Shanghai for the first time. On the other side of the railway line, asphalt from Yumen Oilfield and animal bones and deer antlers from pastoral areas are piled up. The person in charge of the station told us: "In the past, because of high car freight rates and limited transportation capacity, these valuable materials could not be shipped out. Only after the railway was opened to traffic did large-scale shipments begin. The batch of asphalt currently being prepared for shipment to Central South China and North China alone amounts to more than 6,000 tons." As we passed under the tall oil storage tanks, a train pulling oil tanks came head-on. After the train stopped, more than a dozen thick oil pipelines poured crude oil from the storage tanks into the tank cars. This is the starting point for transporting crude oil from Yumen Oilfield by train. Since Wuwei Railway Station began transporting oil, the use of trains to replace car transport in the Wuwei-Lanzhou section alone has saved the state about 10 million yuan in freight costs.
　　A large batch of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and various new-style farm implements are also piled up at Wuwei Railway Station. Farmers from various places are using empty carriages returning from transporting agricultural products and local specialties to haul the newly purchased farm implements back to their rural areas. According to incomplete statistics, more than 6,000 new-style walking plows and hundreds of tons of chemical fertilizers have been transported from Wuwei Railway Station to various rural areas. In the Huangyang River area, the first mechanized farm in the Hexi Corridor was established using tractors and combine harvesters transported by train. After the train arrived in Wuwei, the variety of daily necessities in the Wuwei market also rapidly increased from more than 3,500 to more than 5,200. Jiangxi porcelain, which cars and horse-drawn carts could not transport over long distances in the past, has now been transported to more than 300 tons; farmers in the Hexi Corridor used to cook with earthenware pots, but since the train transported a large number of cheap iron pots, the vast majority of farmers have switched to cooking with iron pots. Guangdong bananas and fresh sea fish have also appeared in the Wuwei market for the first time. The variety of goods transshipped to Xinjiang has also increased by more than 200.
　　The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Wuwei to Lanzhou is 303 kilometers long. Since this section of the railway opened for business in February of this year, it has handled more than one million tons of goods. If the more than 1,000 cars that used to travel between Lanzhou and Wuwei were to undertake the transportation, it would take until the end of the country's second five-year plan to complete the task. This section accounts for only about one-ninth of the total length of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. From November 1st, the more than 200 kilometers from Wuwei to Zhangye has also begun to open for business. In the future, when the entire Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway is completed and connected with the Soviet railway, its enormous role will become even more apparent.

### 在武威车站上

　　在武威车站上
　　郭汾祥
    坐着兰新铁路西行的火车进入河西走廊三小时以后，远远便看到一群新修的建筑物，长长的油罐列车伸展在宽阔的车站里，各种客车、货车正在忙碌地进行编组，起重机也转动着粗大的铁臂，从火车上吊下机器和钢管。这就是河西走廊上的重要车站——武威车站。
    武威是河西走廊上的重要城市，也是从祖国内地前往玉门、新疆等地必需经过的地方。武威车站就在离城五华里的地方，车站附近一带过去是一片荒野，自从去年十二月一日兰新铁路铺轨到这里以后，就迅速地建设起了巨大的货场和仓库，修筑了上千间房屋，一条新修的大马路把车站和甘新公路连接起来，同时从甘新公路上又连接着通向柴达木盆地、雅布赖盐池、山丹煤田等的公路。现在各公路线上的汽车，川流不息地把原油、粮食、药材、皮毛、盐和各种土产特产品运到武威车站，然后再从火车上运出去。
    走进武威车站，好像进入了货物堆成的小山群中，数十个分布在铁路两旁的仓库和货场，从东到西足有三华里长。操纵起重机的工人正在把写着“运往柴达木盆地”、“运往新疆石油公司”的钻机、钻具装上载重汽车。新疆、青海和河西走廊上各个重要建设单位的名字，差不多都可以在车站上找到。这许多建设单位在车站上设立的转运站，经常要用数百辆汽车，把从鞍钢运来的大型钢材、华北的水泥、内蒙古的木材、华东制造的机器源源运送到建设中的工厂、矿山和资源勘探队去。这许多建筑物资约占铁路运入货物总吨数的一半。
    车站上还堆放数百种等待外运的大宗农副产品、工业原料和土产特产品。曾经因交通不便滞销了很长一个时期的蓁艽、羌活、银柴胡等药材，现在已经外运了三十多万斤。河西走廊出产的一千多万斤马铃薯，也装上火车第一次远销到上海等地。在铁路线另一边，堆放着玉门油矿的沥青和来自牧区的兽骨、鹿角等物。车站负责人告诉我们：“过去因为汽车运费高和受运输力的限制，这些宝贵的物资都无法运出，直到铁路通车以后才开始大量外运。仅现在准备运往中南、华北等地的一批沥青就有六千多吨。”当我们走过高大的储油库下面的时候，迎面开来了一列拖着油罐的火车，火车停下后，十多根粗大的输油管就把储油库里的原油灌注进油罐车里去。这里就是利用火车运输玉门油矿原油的起点。自从武威车站开始运油以来，仅武威到兰州一段由火车代替汽车运输，已为国家节省了运费一千万元左右。
    在武威车站上还堆放大批化学肥料、杀虫剂和各种新式农具，从各地来的农民正利用装运农产品和土产特产品的回空马车，把添购的新式农具拉回自己的农村里。据不完全的统计，从武威车站运往各地农村的新式步犁有六千多部，化学肥料有数百吨。在黄羊河地方，就是利用火车运来的拖拉机和联合收割机建立起了河西走廊上第一个机耕农场。火车到了武威，武威市场上的日用百货商品种类也从三千五百多种迅速增加到五千二百多种。过去汽车、马车所不能长途运输的江西瓷器，现在已经运到三百多吨；河西走廊农民过去都用砂锅做饭，自从火车运来大量廉价的铁锅后，广大农民已改用铁锅做饭了。广东香蕉和新鲜的海鱼也第一次出现在武威市场上。转运到新疆去的商品种类也比过去增加了二百多种。
    兰新铁路从武威到兰州一段计长三百零三公里，这段铁路自从今年二月通车营业以来，已经吞吐了一百多万吨的货物，如果要以过去来往在兰州、武威间的一千多辆汽车担任运输，要到国家第二个五年计划结束时才能拉完。这一段仅占兰新铁路全长九分之一左右。从十一月一日起，从武威到张掖段二百多公里又开始通车营业了。将来兰新铁路全线修通并和苏联铁路接轨以后，将会更加显示出它的巨大的作用。
