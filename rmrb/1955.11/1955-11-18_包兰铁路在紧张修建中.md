　　Bao Lan Railway Under Tense Construction
　　By our reporter Kang Weizhong

    The Bao Lan Railway, the major artery connecting North and Northwest China, is under construction.

    The Bao Lan Railway starts from Baotou City in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in the north, passes through important economic control points such as Wuyuan, Linhe, Yinchuan, Zhongwei, and Jingtai, and reaches Lanzhou City in Gansu Province, the terminus of the Longhai Railway. This railway is 1,100 kilometers long. The section of the Bao Lan Railway from Baotou to Yinchuan officially started construction westward from Baotou on October 21st. Tens of thousands of workers are also working hard on key projects in the section from Lanzhou to Yinchuan. The route from Lanzhou to Yinchuan passes through the turbulent Yellow River, the steep mountains of the Helan Mountains, sparsely populated valleys, grasslands, deserts, and bitter water areas. Therefore, building a railway in such an area presents many difficulties in terms of both route surveying and construction. However, the workers building this railway have overcome various difficulties, enabling the Bao Lan Railway project to progress rapidly.

    When the members of the Third Survey and Design Team of the Northwest Design Bureau surveyed the Yellow River riverbed near Jingyuan County, because the ships and other tools they needed had not yet arrived, in order not to stop work, the team members gave full play to their collective wisdom, using hemp rope instead of steel wire rope, wooden pulleys instead of winches, and sheepskin rafts instead of wooden boats, with the result that not only did work not stop but the task was completed ahead of schedule. The team members surveying the vast desert of more than 20 kilometers in Zhongwei County walked barefoot to avoid sand getting into their shoes. When the desert wind came, they used cotton quilts to protect the measuring instruments and persisted in their work. In order to speed up the survey, in addition to learning and promoting the advanced experience of the Soviet "cross-section alignment method," the team members also created methods such as "oblique distance wire drawing" and "altitude calculation disks," overcoming many difficulties in surveying high mountains and deep valleys, so that after the final survey of this section of the line was completed, compared with the preliminary survey, there was a great improvement in quality.

    Currently, more than 20,000 railway workers are working hard to build this section of the project on the 68-kilometer-long railway line from Lanzhou to Xingxingwan. This section of the road is a huge and arduous project, requiring the construction of three large bridges, sixteen medium and small bridges, ten tunnels, one hundred and fifty-six culvert projects, and earth and stone works amounting to more than 5.9 million cubic meters. China's largest arch bridge, the Yellow River Bridge of the Bao Lan Railway, has entered the high-altitude operation stage. Workers have erected huge safety nets over the rushing Yellow River rapids, and workers wearing safety belts are climbing on scaffolding three to four meters high to carry out construction. Crane workers have introduced a steel arch frame assembly line method, which improves work efficiency by about 50%, so that the first steel arch frame across the Yellow River was erected ahead of schedule. Concrete workers have also come up with many advanced methods to overcome the difficulties of pouring concrete bridge piers at high altitudes, so that the No. 2 pier was quickly built to a height of 45.24 meters. This guarantees that the bridge will be completed soon. The No. 3 pier of the Shuifu River Bridge and the concrete project of the bridge abutment in the direction of Lanzhou have been poured above the flood level, and the foundation of the remaining abutments is being poured. Xingxingwan Tunnel, is one of the larger of all tunnel projects, is not only dry and lacking water, but also has particularly hard stone inside the tunnel. The tunnel team responsible for this project overcame various natural and technical difficulties after arriving at the construction site. Now half of the earth and stone work of this section of the line has been completed, and the tunnel project has all entered underground operations.

    On the key project construction sites from Lanzhou to Yinchuan, mechanized and semi-mechanized construction methods have been widely adopted, greatly improving work efficiency. For example, the mechanized road construction team carrying out construction at the Changchuanzi construction site has hundreds of employees using a large number of bulldozers and scrapers to replace the manual labor of more than 3,000 workers. Inspired by the realization of the Five-Year Plan, the employees have proposed to ensure that the mechanical repair and maintenance work is done well, further exert the effectiveness of the machinery, and accelerate the overall progress of the project.

    After the Bao Lan Railway is built, it will not only facilitate transportation between North and Northwest China, but also connect the Beijing to Jining-Erenhot-Ulaanbaatar railway and the Beijing to Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty railway. This will play a huge role in promoting economic and cultural exchanges between China and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, developing the rich mineral resources of the Northwest, giving full play to the potential of agricultural production, increasing output, and improving people's living standards.

　　包兰铁路在紧张修建中
　　本报记者　康伟中
    连接华北、西北的大动脉——包兰铁路正在修建中。
    包兰铁路北起内蒙古自治区的包头市，经过五原、临河、银川、中卫、景泰等重要经济控制点，到达陇海铁路的终点——甘肃省兰州市。这条铁路全长一千一百公里。包兰路从包头到银川段在十月二十一日已经正式开始由包头向西修建。由兰州到银川段的重点工程，数万名职工也正在紧张地施工。由兰州到银川段线路，要经过奔腾急湍的黄河、陡峻的贺兰山余脉；要经过人烟稀少的沟谷地带、草原、沙漠和苦水区。因此，在这样一个地区修建铁路，无论在线路勘测和施工方面的困难都是很多的。但是，修建这条铁路的职工们，克服了种种困难，使包兰铁路的工程进展很快。
    当西北设计分局的第三勘测设计总队的队员勘测到靖远县附近的黄河河床的时候，由于所用的船只和其他工具还没有运到，为了不使工作停顿，队员们发挥了集体智慧，采用麻绳代替钢丝绳，用老乡木辘代替绞车，用羊皮筏子代替木船，结果不仅没有停工而且提前完成了任务。在中卫县二十多公里的广阔沙漠中勘测的队员们，为了避免鞋内灌进沙子，就光着脚走路。沙漠狂风袭来，他们用棉被围护测量器，坚持工作。为了加快勘测速度，队员们除了学习和推广苏联的“横断面选线法”的先进经验外，还创造了“斜距拉线”、“高度计算盘”等方法，克服了许多高山深谷勘测的困难，使这段线路定测完成后，同初测比较，在质量上有很大的提高。
    目前，从兰州到猩猩湾长达六十八公里的铁路线上，两万多名铁路职工正在为修建这段工程进行紧张的劳动。这段路工程艰巨浩大，要跨过大桥三座，中小桥十六座，隧道十座，涵管工程一百五十六处，土石方工程就达五百九十多万方。我国最大的拱桥——包兰铁路黄河大桥工程进入高空作业阶段，工人们在奔腾叫嚣的黄河急流上架起了巨大的安全网，套着安全带的工人攀登在三、四公尺高的脚手架上进行施工。起重工人推行了钢拱架流水作业拼装法，提高工作效率百分之五十左右，使第一孔横跨黄河的钢拱架提前架好。混凝土工人也想出了许多先进的办法，克服了在高空灌注混凝土桥墩的困难，使第二号桥墩迅速修到四十五点二四公尺的高度。这就保证了这座大桥很快地完工。水阜河大桥三号桥墩和兰州方向桥台混凝土工程已灌到洪水位以上，其余墩台基础正在灌注。猩猩湾大隧道，是所有隧道工程中较大的一个，这里不仅气候干燥，缺乏水源，而且隧道内的石质特别坚硬。担任这一工程的隧道队，到达工地后，克服了种种自然和技术上的困难。现在这段线路的全部土石方工程已完成了一半，隧道工程已全进入洞内作业。
    在兰州到银川段重点工程工地上，大都采用了机械化和半机械化的施工，大大提高了工作效率。如在长川子工地进行施工的机械筑路工程队，数百名职工运用大批推土机、铲运机代替了三千多工人的体力劳动。职工们在实现五年计划的鼓舞下，都提出保证要作好机械检修保养工作，进一步发挥机械效能，加速全面工程进展。
    包兰铁路修建后，不仅便利了华北和西北的交通，而且把北京到集宁——二连——乌兰巴托铁路和北京到兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿拉木图铁路连接起来。这对于沟通我国同苏联和各人民民主国家的经济和文化交流、开发西北丰富的矿产资源、发挥农业生产潜力、增加产量、提高人民生活水平都将发生巨大的作用。（附图片）
