　　Well-Drilling Units Should Cherish the Coal Produced During Construction

To the Editor:

　　In the process of constructing tunnels for the new Xing'antai vertical shaft's south and north inclined shafts by the Hegang Mining Bureau, the stones excavated contain 15% to 50% coal. After washing and sorting, some of this coal can be used as high-quality coal, while the lower-quality portion can be utilized as inferior coal. However, the well-drilling staff claimed it was "impossible to sort" and discarded this "industrial grain" along with the stones! For example, among the approximately 10,000 tons of stones excavated from the south inclined shaft, it is estimated that at least 2,000 tons of coal could be sorted out. In addition, the Hegang Mining Bureau has a lot of construction coal that has not been transported out in time due to unsuitable storage locations for loading or substandard coal quality, resulting in a large backlog. Even worse, the No. 9 inclined shaft of the No. 1 mine actually stores construction coal in a pit fifteen meters deep.

　　The Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau has previously issued regulations regarding the storage, preservation methods, and loading locations for construction coal, but these well-drilling units of the Hegang Mining Bureau have failed to implement these regulations, citing "financial difficulties." This is a serious act of irresponsibility. It is hoped that the relevant leadership departments will take effective measures to inspect and improve this work.

### 建井单位应该爱惜建设产煤

　  建井单位应该爱惜建设产煤编辑同志：
    鹤岗矿务局新建的兴安台竖井南、北斜井在巷道施工过程中掘出来的石头里面，含有百分之十五到五十的煤。这些煤在洗选以后，有一部分可以当好煤使用，另一部分质量较差的，可以当劣质煤利用。但是，建井工作人员竟说是“无法挑选”，就把这些“工业粮食”连同石头一起丢弃了！例如，南斜井掘出的约一万吨的石头中间，估计至少可以选出二千多吨煤。此外，鹤岗矿务局还有很多建设产煤，因为贮煤地点不适合装车条件或煤质不合标准，没有及时运出，造成大量积压。更糟糕的是，新一矿九斜井居然把建设产煤贮存在十五公尺深的大坑里。
    关于建设产煤的保管工作、贮存办法和装车地点等问题，东北煤矿管理总局曾经有过规定，但是鹤岗矿务局的这些建井单位借口“经费困难”，没有执行这个规定。这是严重的不负责任的行为。希望有关的领导部门采取有效措施检查和改进这个工作。
