　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Many mass rallies and gatherings were held in various parts of the German Democratic Republic on the 18th to discuss the results of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.
　　Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, spoke at a conference of intellectuals held in Erfurt. He emphasized that when the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference discussed the issues on the agenda, unlike the Soviet delegation, the Western countries' representatives were guided not by the instructions of the heads of the four governments, but by the desire of the monopoly capitalists who were interested in a new war to strengthen their political position. Dieckmann emphasized that the West's proposals ran counter to the interests of the German people. He called on intellectuals to actively fight for the vital interests of the German people and for the implementation of the policies being pursued by the government of Germany's first worker-peasant state, which are beneficial to the entire German people.
　　Deputy Prime Minister Nuschke spoke at a mass rally of teachers in Dresden. Nuschke said: What the German people are striving for is to establish an independent, peace-loving, and democratic Germany, and not to have the whole of Germany join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. When talking about the tasks of the German people, Nuschke said that the results of the conference should prompt progressive forces to carry out more active struggles for the establishment of a European security system, against the policies of the North Atlantic Alliance, and against militarism and fascism.
　　Xinhua News Agency, November 21st: According to a TASS dispatch from Rome on the 19th: A delegation composed of members of the Italian parliament and leaders of the Italian National Peace Council visited the Soviet, American, British, and French embassies in Italy and delivered letters, emphasizing the need to further strive to ease international tensions and consolidate friendship between peoples of all countries. The letter stated that Italian peace defenders will continue to work in this direction.

　　民主德国人民集会讨论四国外长会议结果
　　意大利议员和和平人士代表团要求四大国进一步缓和局势
    据新华社讯　德意志民主共和国各地在十八日举行了许多群众大会和集会，讨论四国外交部长会议的结果。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼在欧法特举行的知识分子大会上讲话。他强调说，在四国外交部长会议讨论议程上的各个问题的时候，和苏联代表团不同，指导西方国家代表的不是四国政府首脑的指示，而是对新战争有兴趣的垄断资本家要加强政治地位的愿望。狄克曼强调说，西方的建议是和德国人民的利益背道而驰的。他号召知识分子积极地为德国人民的切身利益，为德国的第一个工农国家的政府正在执行的有利于全德国人民的政策的实现而奋斗。
    副总理努舍克在德累斯顿举行的教师群众大会上讲了话。努舍克说：德国人民所努力的是建立一个独立的、爱好和平的、民主的德国，而不是使整个德国加入北大西洋公约组织。在谈到德国人民的任务的时候，努舍克说，会议结果应当促使进步力量为建立欧洲安全体系、反对北大西洋联盟的政策、反对军国主义和法西斯主义进行更积极的斗争。
    新华社二十一日讯　据塔斯社罗马十九日讯：由意大利议会议员和意大利全国和平理事会领导人员组成的代表团访问了苏联、美国、英国和法国驻意大使馆，并且递交了信件，信中强调必须进一步为缓和国际紧张局势、巩固各国人民之间的友谊而斗争。信中说，意大利的和平保卫者将继续朝这个方向努力。
