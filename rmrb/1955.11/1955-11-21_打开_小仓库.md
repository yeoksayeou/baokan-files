　　Opening the "Small Warehouses"
    The Fushun City Committee of the Communist Youth League actively supports the initiative of the Mechanical and Electrical Workshop of the Petroleum Plant No. 1 to "open the small warehouses." This initiative immediately transformed into concrete saving actions by the masses. According to incomplete statistics from units such as the Heavy Machinery Plant, the Electric Porcelain Plant, the Petroleum Plant No. 1, the Open-pit Mine, and the Steel Plant, young workers have turned in more than 44,000 tools and materials, worth over 119,000 yuan.
    Opening the "small warehouses" has many benefits for production. Workers bring out the tools and materials accumulated in their own hands and use them in production, which can eliminate the losses and waste of each occupying "one's own spot," and can also eliminate the chaos of materials and tools not being uniformly managed and used. The greatest significance of this initiative lies in educating the workers, raising their awareness of cherishing state property, and establishing new moral qualities. Ren Shanglu, a young worker at the Fushun Electric Porcelain Plant, said: "Tools and materials are all state property. Accumulating them in one's own hands and not allowing them to play a role affects the entire production and the use by comrades. This is a criminal act against the people and an immoral thing." He consciously turned in 54 types of tools, electrical, plumbing and other materials, worth more than 4,700 yuan, accumulated in his "small warehouse".

　  打开“小仓库”
    青年团抚顺市委积极支持石油一厂机电车间“打开小仓库”的倡议，这个倡议立刻变成群众的具体节约行动。据重机厂、电瓷厂、石油一厂、露天矿和钢厂等单位的不完全统计，青年工人交出工具和材料四万四千多件，价值十一万九千多元。
    打开“小仓库”对生产上的好处很多，工人把积压在自己手边的工具和材料拿出来，用在生产上，可以消除各霸“一摊子”的损失和浪费，也可以消除材料和工具不能统一管理和使用的混乱现象。这个倡议最大的意义，还是在于教育了工人，提高工人爱护国家财产的观念，树立新的道德品质。抚顺电瓷厂青工任尚禄说：“工具、材料都是国家的财产，积压在自己手里不能发挥作用，影响了整个生产和同志们的使用，这是对人民的犯罪行为和不道德的事。”他自觉地把积压在自己“小仓库”里的价值四千七百多元的五十四种工具、电气、水暖等材料交了出来。
