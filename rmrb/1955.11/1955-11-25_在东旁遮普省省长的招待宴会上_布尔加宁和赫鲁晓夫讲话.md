Xinhua News Agency dispatch from TASS: Soviet Union Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin and Soviet Union Supreme Soviet Presidium Member Khrushchev gave speeches on November 22nd at a banquet held for them by the Governor of East Punjab, Singh. They attended this banquet after visiting the Bhakra-Nangal Dam project.

After the Governor gave a brief welcome speech, Bulganin responded, expressing gratitude for the warm welcome and reception. He said that the hospitality of the Punjab people had deeply moved them and reminded them of their homeland. After returning home, they would convey to the Soviet people the feelings with which the Indian people had welcomed them.

Subsequently, Khrushchev delivered a brief speech. He said, "We have been staying in this beautiful country for a few days. Truly, I cannot count how many days it has been, because there have been so many interesting impressions and meetings during this time. We have different political views. You have your own viewpoints and your own philosophy, and we also have our own viewpoints and our own philosophy. Why should we clarify the issues on which we disagree now? It is more important to see where we agree on the main issues. That is the issue of war and peace... As for what kind of national system, that is the internal affair of each country. As for political views, that is everyone's own business. Therefore, we ask other countries not to interfere in our internal affairs, and we ourselves will not interfere in the internal affairs of others."

Khrushchev said: "We are particularly pleased that our friends have let us visit the construction of the power station. This is a struggle against the forces of nature, an effort to conquer nature and strive to make nature serve mankind. The solution to this task is particularly important for the economically backward people of India, who are economically backward not through their own fault, but through the fault of others; I do not want to point them out, you know who is being spoken of, and they themselves know."

"We have said that we are ready to share our experience in peaceful construction with you. But some newspapers that reflect the views of those who are dissatisfied with our visit to India are now writing: Khrushchev and Bulganin are cunning people, they will deceive India with promises of technical assistance, and the Indian people should be wary of them."

"To those who write such things, we say: Do you want to compete with us in building friendship with the Indian people? Let us compete. What have we brought here? We have come to you with sincere hearts, we have come to you with honest intentions. We tell you: Do you want to build factories? We are very happy about that. Perhaps you lack experience? Then come to us, we will help you."

"Do you want to build power stations? If you have no experience in this area, if you need technical assistance, then come to us, we will help you. Do you want to send your students and engineers to us to study? Please send them. This is our 'cunning.' Now pay attention, and don't let us deceive you as some people write. We very much hope that other countries will also show such 'cunning.' Competing in this is better than competing in the production of atomic and hydrogen bombs. This is a more noble cause."

"As for certain articles and radio broadcasts whose authors are trying to make us quarrel with you, we don't care about these things."

"Now people are used to judging things based on facts, not on words."

Then, the Maharaja of Patiala presented Bulganin and Khrushchev with gifts - two swords inlaid with gold and silver. The Maharaja said, "Let these two swords serve to defend peace." Bulganin and Khrushchev thanked the Maharaja for the precious gifts and presented the Maharaja with gifts made by Soviet artisans.

Khrushchev expressed his gratitude for the Maharaja's gift. He continued: "Seeing this beautiful sword, I can't help but recall the view of us Soviet people: After a baby is born, it needs to be carefully taken care of. If it is not taken care of, not protected, if no one cares for it, it will die..."

Khrushchev said: "The situation of a country is also like this. Our country was born thirty-eight years ago. It was still very weak at that time, and could barely stand steady, and suddenly fourteen countries attacked it. The British were among those who attacked us. British journalists here, please forgive me. But, as the saying goes, the words in a song cannot be deleted. This is a historical fact. The Americans, French, and Japanese also attacked us. What should we do? Wait for death? No. Our people will not do that. They drew their swords to defend the young country. We fought very well. We defeated the invaders and said: Don't come and fight us again."

"In ancient times, a Russian duke said: Whoever comes at us with a sword will die by the sword. We still maintain such a rule. We welcome honored guests, and we will treat them well. But, whoever wants to come to us as an enemy with a sword, then let him remember that the fate of Hitler is the fate of any enemy."

"I don't want to give you any advice, but I can't help but ask: How many years has India been oppressed by colonialists? For several centuries. Of course, you yourselves will think of protecting freedom and independence. Based on our experience, I can say that some people are watching us intently, and they are thinking of destroying us. Of course, we hope that our bombs and shells will never explode. We would rather produce our tractors and other useful things. But, what would happen to us if we disarmed? We would definitely be crushed to powder, and then our descendants would say: It was the great Lenin who was able to correctly understand the interests of the people. Under his leadership, the Soviet system triumphed, the Soviet state was established, but the successors were unable to defend the freedom and independence of this country. In order to prevent this from happening, we must sacredly protect our freedom. It must be done. You must also cherish what you have achieved in arduous struggles. We sincerely hope that you will do so."

### 在东旁遮普省省长的招待宴会上　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫讲话

　　在东旁遮普省省长的招待宴会上
　　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫讲话
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫十一月二十二日在东旁遮普省省长辛格为他们举行的宴会上发表了谈话。他们是在参观巴克拉—南加尔水闸工程之后出席这次宴会的。
    在省长发表了简短的欢迎词后，布尔加宁致答词，对热情的欢迎和接待表示感谢。他说，旁遮普人对我们的接待深深地感动了我们，使我们想起了我们的家乡，我们回家之后要向苏联人传达印度人以怎样的感情来欢迎我们。
    随后，赫鲁晓夫发表了简短的讲话。他说，我们在这个美好国家里停留了几天了。真的，我算不清有几天了，因为在这段时间内有趣的印象和会晤是太多了。我们有着不同的政治见解，你们有自己的观点和自己的哲学，我们也有自己的观点和自己的哲学。我们现在何必来澄清那些我们意见不一致的问题呢？更重要的是应该看到我们在主要问题上是一致的。这就是战争和和平的问题……至于什么样的国家制度，这是每一个国家的内部事务。至于政治观点，那是每一个人的事情。因而，我们要求其他国家不要干涉我们的内政，我们自己也不会去干涉别人的内政。
    赫鲁晓夫说：我们特别高兴的是，我们的朋友恰恰让我们参观了发电站的建设。这是同自然力的斗争，是征服自然以及争取使自然为人类服务的努力。这个任务的解决对于在经济上落后的印度人民是特别重要的，印度人民在经济上落后并非由于自己的过错，而是他人的罪过；我不想指出他们，你们知道所说的是谁，他们自己也知道。
    我们已经说过，我们准备把自己的和平建设经验介绍给你们。但是反映了不满意我们访问印度的人的观点的某些报纸现在写道：赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁是狡猾的人，他们会用技术帮助的诺言来欺骗印度，印度人应当对他们当心。
    我们对那些写这样一些话的人说：你们是不是想跟我们在同印度人建立友谊的事情上竞赛呢？让我们来作竞赛罢。我们带着什么到这里来的呢？我们是带着坦率的心情到你们这里来的，我们是带着正直的意图到你们这里来的。我们告诉你们：你们想建筑工厂吗？我们对这点感到很高兴。或许你们经验不足吧？那么，找我们，我们帮助你们。
    你们想建筑电力站吗？要是你们在这方面没有经验，要是你们需要技术上的帮助，那么，找我们，我们帮助你们。你们想派遣自己的学生和工程师到我们那里学习吗？请派来罢。这就是我们的
  “狡猾”，现在请注意，可不要让我们像某些人所写那样欺骗了你们。我们非常希望其他国家也表现这样的“狡猾”。在这方面竞赛比在生产原子弹和氢弹方面竞赛要好。这是更加崇高的事业。
    至于说到某些文章和电台广播，它们的作者是企图使我们跟你们争吵的，但是我们对这些东西是不在乎的。
    现在人们已经习惯于根据事实而不是根据言辞来判断事物了。
    接着，巴地阿拉的大君向布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫赠送礼物——两把用金银镶嵌的宝剑。大君说，“让这两把剑为保卫和平服务。”布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫感谢大君所赠送的珍贵礼物，并且把苏联手工艺工人制的礼物赠给大君。
    赫鲁晓夫对大君的礼物表示感谢。他接着说：看到这把漂亮的宝剑，我不禁想起我们苏联人的这种看法：一个婴儿诞生之后，需要得到小心的照料。如果他得不到照料，得不到保护，如果没有人关怀他，他就会死去。……
    赫鲁晓夫说：国家的情况也是这样。我们的国家是在三十八年以前诞生的。它当时还很衰弱，还只能勉勉强强站得稳，而一下子就有十四个国家向它进攻。向我们进攻的就有英国人。在这里的英国记者先生们，请你们原谅。但是，正如谚语所说的，歌里面的词句是删不掉的。这是历史的事实。向我们进攻的还有美国人、法国人和日本人。我们怎么办呢？束手待毙吗？不。我们的人民不这样做。他们抽出自己的剑来保卫年青的国家。我们打仗打得很好。我们击败了侵略者，并且说：不要再来跟我们打仗。
    在很古的时候有一个俄国公爵曾说道：谁拿着剑向我们闯来，谁就要死在剑下。这样一个规则我们现在还保持着。对于贵客我们是表示欢迎的，我们将好好地招待他们。但是，谁想作为敌人拿着剑到我们那里去，那末请他记住，希特勒的下场也就是任何敌人的下场。
    我不想向你们进任何的忠言，但是，不由得要问一问：印度受殖民主义者的压迫有多少年？有几百年。当然，你们自己会想到保护自由和独立。我根据我们的经验可以说，有些人是虎视眈眈地在看着我们，他们在想法使我们毁灭。当然，我们希望我们的炸弹和炮弹永远不爆炸。我们宁愿生产我们的拖拉机和其他有用的东西。但是，我们如果卸下了武装，对我们会发生什么呢？我们一定会被踏成齑粉，那时我们的子孙就要说了：还是伟大的列宁，他能正确地了解人民的利益。在他的领导下，苏维埃制度胜利了，苏维埃国家建立了，而继承人却不能捍卫住这个国家的自由和独立。为了不致发生这种事，我们要神圣地保护我们的自由。非这样做不可。你们也要珍惜你们在艰苦的斗争中所取得的东西。我们恳切地希望你们这样做。
