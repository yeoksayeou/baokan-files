　　Many Advanced Workers Exceed National Plan

　　This newspaper reports that advanced workers and advanced groups in many factories in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Dalian, Qiqihar, and other places have excellently completed the national production plan.

　　The workers of the lathe operator Li Shuyuan group in the mechanical processing workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory in Beijing, after completing the full year's workload ahead of schedule in October, are now working on the tasks for February next year. Cao Yongkang, a Shanghai model worker and planer in the first metalworking workshop of the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Textile Machinery Factory, from the first year of the first Five-Year Plan to November 18th this year, has completed the workload of five years, eight months, and eighteen days in two years, ten months, and eighteen days. He has never produced defective products, nor has there been any industrial injury or accidents involving machinery and equipment. Zhu Jisheng, a youth sand molding worker at the Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machinery Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, has completed four years and six months of work from 1953 to August this year. When he makes a product, he always studies it carefully in advance and tries to improve the operation methods. Therefore, he can not only guarantee the quality of the product, but also overfulfill the task every month. Now, he is striving to complete five years of work by the end of the year. The workers of the youth small parts group in the sand casting workshop of the Dalian Machine Tool Factory have completed the production quota for 1957 ahead of schedule and have started production for 1958. Now, they are actively responding to the initiatives proposed by Qi Changyuan, Zhu Weiqin, and Zhang Liande at the National Congress of Active Young Builders of Socialism, and ensuring that they will complete eight and a half years of work during the first Five-Year Plan. All the employees of the shipbuilding machinery factory of the Dalian Shipbuilding Company also overfulfilled the annual national plan and the production increase and conservation plan one and a half months ahead of schedule. Starting from November 16th, they have started working on the 1956 tasks. Yu Pengdi, a youth sand casting worker at the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Factory, improved seven kinds of tools and operation methods, and used advanced experience on more than 20 kinds of parts, which improved production efficiency. Since the beginning of the Five-Year Plan, he has completed the production plan month by month and year by year, and now he is already working on the fourth quarter of 1956. Forty-one lathe operators at the Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory had completed the full year's workload by November 15th and started working on the tasks for next year. Zhu Xianggen, Wang Tongyan, Lu Shaozhen, You Xiehe, and other 15 workers in the mechanical processing workshop of the Wuxi Machine Tool Factory also completed this year's production tasks ahead of schedule by the end of October.

　　In addition, the Youth Hao coal mining team of the Fuxin Coal Mine, the Youth Rapid Excavation Team of the X'an Mining Bureau of Liaoyuan City, and the fifth group of the third motorcade of the Qingdao Transportation Company have all completed this year's national plan ahead of schedule.
