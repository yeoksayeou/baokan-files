Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 21st: The Hatoyama Cabinet of Japan held an emergency cabinet meeting on the morning of the 21st and decided to resign en masse. The Hatoyama Cabinet also notified the Speakers of both Houses of the Diet of its decision on the same day. The Diet will convene an extraordinary session on the 22nd to elect a prime minister to form a new cabinet.

The Liberal Democratic Party, which was recently formed by the merger of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, is actively preparing to form a new cabinet, mainly by absorbing some former Liberal Party members into the cabinet. The original cabinet was composed entirely of former Democratic Party members. According to Kyodo News, the Liberal Democratic Party will continue to nominate Ichiro Hatoyama as its candidate for prime minister.

The Central Executive Committee of the Socialist Party issued a statement on the 21st, pointing out that the Hatoyama Cabinet's resignation en masse is to cover up the successive setbacks in its important domestic and foreign policies. The Socialist Party expressed its opposition to the Liberal Democratic Party's intention to form the third Hatoyama Cabinet without a general election, and firmly demanded the rapid dissolution of the House of Representatives to seek the opinions of the people.

According to Kyodo News, the Socialist Party is preparing to nominate its chairman, Mozaburo Suzuki, as a candidate for prime minister.
