The first phase of the renovation project of Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Primary Rolling Mill was completed forty-six days ahead of schedule on November 15th. Two huge soaking pits have begun baking. When the furnace temperature reaches the standard, heated steel billets can be sent to the rolling mill to roll various types of steel. After the two soaking pits are put into production, the primary rolling mill's billet supply capacity can be increased by more than 20%, thereby improving the situation where the potential of the plant's equipment could not be fully utilized due to insufficient billet supply.
　　This project started in early July this year. As soon as the workers entered the construction site, they proposed the competition condition of "completion ahead of schedule." They promoted advanced experiences such as assembly line operations and overall installation.

### 鞍钢第一初轧厂第一期改建工程提前完工

　　鞍钢第一初轧厂第一期改建工程提前完工
    鞍钢第一初轧厂第一期改建工程已提前四十六天于十一月十五日完成。两座庞大的均热炉已经开始烘烤，待炉温达到标准时，就可以把烘热的钢坯送到轧钢机上轧制各种钢材。两座均热炉投入生产后，可使初轧厂供应钢坯能力提高百分之二十以上，从而改善了因钢坯供应不足影响全厂设备潜力不能发挥的情况。
    这项工程是在今年七月初动工的。工人进入工地就提出“提前交工”的竞赛条件。他们推行了流水作业和整体安装等先进经验。
