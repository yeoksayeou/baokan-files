A Good Leadership Method in the Cooperative Movement
—Introducing the Experience of the Party Committees at All Levels in Xuchang Area Organizing Commune Guidance Groups
Song Haiyan

In the work of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives in the Xuchang area of Henan Province last winter and this spring, experienced old cooperative cadres and activists were selected to form commune guidance groups to assist the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives in areas with relatively weak work. Experience has shown that this is a new leadership method that adapts to the new situation of the great development of cooperativization.

New Situation Requires New Leadership Methods

In the winter of 1954, the number of cooperatives in the fifteen counties and three suburban districts of Xuchang Prefecture increased from the original 2,117 to 7,900; the number of households in the old cooperatives also increased. The number of farmers joining the cooperatives accounted for 16.32% of the total number of farm households in the area. After the great development, many new problems arose, the most prominent of which was that the leadership could not keep up with the needs of the movement's development. The more backward the areas with a weak foundation of mutual assistance and cooperation, the more prominent this situation became. Previously, although many organizations such as "Joint Cooperative Committees" and "Mutual Assistance and Cooperation Networks" had been established in various places, and they did play a significant role; however, their scope of action was limited to one or several townships. Those areas that were dozens or hundreds of miles away and had a weak foundation of mutual assistance and cooperation could not be "netted" or "connected." Obviously, the work itself required a new leadership method to be adopted. The commune guidance group was born to adapt to this new situation.

Organization of the Commune Guidance Group

The commune guidance group is a method of using advanced old cooperatives to drive new cooperatives forward together. There are three methods for organizing the commune guidance group: one is organized by the prefectural party committee, and this guidance group is specifically organized by the rural work department of the prefectural party committee. The members are all better cooperative presidents, cooperative cadres, and activists from advanced counties in mutual assistance and cooperation. After being concentrated in the prefectural party committee, they undergo brief study and training (usually about three days) and are formed into several guidance groups (each group should consist of about six people). Led by people sent by the prefectural party committee, they go to various counties for巡回 guidance. The other two are commune guidance groups organized by the county party committee or district party committee, which are responsible for organizing, training, and leading the group within their respective county or district to solve problems in weaker areas. As for what kind of backbone should be composed of the guidance group, it should be determined by the task of organizing the guidance group at that time. Because the main task of the last winter was to help build communes, the guidance group was composed of representative figures of various types in the old communes, in response to the many misunderstandings and concerns of the masses about building communes. They used their own ideological transformation process when they first joined the communes to set an example and break through other people's thoughts. Because the main task of organizing this spring was to help the new communes consolidate and turn to production, in response to the situation that most communes had many "four assessments" leftover problems, chaotic labor organization, no production plan, no accounting established, and unreasonable work evaluation and scoring, the guidance group was organized with the participation of male and female presidents, vice presidents, production team leaders, and accountants of old communes with leadership abilities. They used their experience in solving the chaos in their own communes to help the new communes quickly establish production order and turn to production. The duration of these two guidances was about twenty days.

Activities of the Commune Guidance Group

The specific work content of the commune guidance group is mainly to explain the Party's principles and policies on agricultural cooperativization to the masses, especially members and group members, by introducing the actual situation of their own communes, explaining the superiority of cooperatives and some specific experiences on how to run cooperatives. When building communes last winter, the guidance group mainly promoted the superiority of agricultural producers' cooperatives—promoting the increase in income of various types of commune members, and promoting the step-by-step development of mutual aid teams to cooperatives. This spring, in consolidating communes, the guidance group mainly promoted the experience of how the communes were brought into the normal production track after the chaos, and specifically helped some new communes solve problems, so that the new communes turned to production. In addition, some labor models who had been to big cities (such as Su Dianxuan) also combined their own experiences to promote the prospects of socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization. What the commune guidance group members talked about were their own actual experiences, so they were not only rich in content, but also vivid, specific, and easy to understand.

The specific activities of the commune guidance group mainly include the following three types:

First, a combination of general reports and group discussions to impart commune-running experience. First, one person makes a comprehensive report, and then other people focus on a certain aspect or a certain issue to make supplementary speeches; after the report, the masses are organized to discuss and deliberate, and the members of the group go deep into each group to solve the specific problems raised by everyone. This method solves problems on a wide scale, and there are many occasions for activities; some are held at the district (or sub-district) level, classifying (such as commune presidents, accountants, team leaders, etc.) or not classifying specialized commune cadre meetings; others are held during various commune cadre meetings or cadre training classes. However, no matter what occasion this method is used, it is necessary to contact local district and township cadres in advance, fully understand the situation, and accurately grasp the common and prominent problems existing in the local communes, and then prescribe the right medicine to achieve the due effect.

Second, the combination of saying and doing. The specific approach is to go deep into a key commune to help build and consolidate the commune, obtain experience, and then hold a meeting to promote it comprehensively. This spring, the Baofeng County Guidance Sub-group also established fifteen long-term mutual assistance and cooperation networks and accounting networks in Yanling County, based on the combination of point and area.

Third, establish a mutual assistance and cooperation inquiry office. Commune and group members ask questions, and the guidance group answers questions, so that they can answer questions as they are asked and answer every question.

The two commune guidance groups organized in the Xuchang area last winter and this spring (excluding those organized by the district committee) drew 904 old commune backbones, formed 140 guidance groups, and organized general reports and small group discussions in 149 districts and 1,058 townships; the total number of listeners was 364,892. The mutual assistance and cooperation inquiry office was set up to answer 2,444 difficult questions.

Guidance Effect

The organization of commune guidance groups in Xuchang Prefecture has played a huge role in promoting the advancement of the cooperativization movement.

First, it effectively solved the problems of "more communes and fewer cadres" and insufficient leadership experience brought about by the great development of cooperativization. Taking this spring as an example, at that time, the leadership's energy was almost entirely concentrated on rush work. At this time, many agricultural cooperatives (especially new cooperatives) were in danger of collapsing because they did not have superior leadership and problems could not be solved in time. At that time, the prefectural party committee and the county party committees organized commune guidance groups including 823 old commune backbones, and successively went to various districts and townships with poor mutual assistance and cooperation foundations to conduct巡回 guidance. They helped 1,093 communes solve problems and turn to production. In addition, they also helped to build and consolidate 85 mutual assistance and cooperation networks and 87 accounting networks, and rectified and built many mutual aid teams. It is particularly worth pointing out that the guidance group solved problems very quickly. The reason is that the problems encountered by the current new communes are exactly the problems that the old communes have already solved and have gained experience and lessons from solving.

Secondly, it greatly promoted the development of the local production movement. The members of the guidance group are not only the leading backbones of the old communes, with experience in leading the collective agricultural economy, but also active members and skilled workers in production, mastering many advanced production technologies. The Jia County Guidance Sub-group in Songzhai Township, Fugou County, in less than 20 days, not only helped all ten cooperatives in the township to implement small contracting (including four seasonal contracting), improved labor management, and improved the production enthusiasm of the members, overcoming the phenomenon of idleness and waste; and the guidance group also helped them break through the local conventions by checking, calculating, comparing, and introducing their own commune's production experience, etc., and purchased thatch vats, built pig pens, repaired toilets, replaced wall soil, and accumulated grass and wood ash, etc., for a total of more than 2,660 carts of fertilizer; pulled out the flower firewood in the ground in advance; and helped five communes start sideline production such as grinding tofu,弹花, and轧花.

Third, the guidance group not only gave communes and teams management experience and technical assistance wherever they went, but also improved the ideological awareness of members and group members. Since the guidance group includes various types of commune cadres and members, their speeches are very enlightening and educational for the same farmers and commune cadres. Moreover, this kind of guidance group goes everywhere to make reports and impart commune-running experience, which is easy to create a "momentum" in the countryside, and can quickly make the movement of "participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives" become the center of public opinion. In addition, the members of the guidance group are mostly famous labor models, many of whom have visited the country's factories and big cities, so they are knowledgeable and understand a lot; through their introduction of their own feelings, not only did the audience see today, but also saw tomorrow. The masses generally reflected: "The guidance group's words are all the way, and every sentence is satisfactory. The road pointed out by Chairman Mao to us—mutual assistance and cooperation—is becoming clearer and clearer." The masses' confidence in running communes is unprecedentedly high.

Fourth, it improved the political awareness and handling ability of the guidance group members themselves, further strengthened and consolidated the backbone leadership of the original old communes, and provided favorable conditions for consolidating the old communes in the future. Although the members of the guidance group are all old commune backbones with certain work experience and handling ability, after all, their understanding of the policies is not deep enough, and they often regard the methods of dealing with problems in their own communes as an unchangeable "theorem," which seems to be "unshakable" in any situation and any condition. After participating in the commune guidance group, after studying the Party's various policies on mutual assistance and cooperation, and 巡回 guidance to other townships and counties, it greatly helped them overcome this narrow-minded empiricist view; it enabled them to learn the ability to adopt different methods to deal with problems according to different situations in accordance with the spirit of the Party's policies. On this basis, some commune presidents also took the initiative to check the problems existing in their own communes and proposed solutions after returning home. Many of the guidance group members said afterwards: "Participating in a guidance group is really faster than studying for two months."

Issues to Note

From the above preliminary experience, the following matters must be noted in order to better exert the role of the commune guidance group and achieve greater results.

First, when starting to organize the guidance group, members must be carefully selected—they must find commune presidents or members who are politically aware, run the commune well, increase production more, and have the ability to handle affairs. However, on the other hand, attention should also be paid to the consolidation and improvement of the old communes; generally speaking, it is appropriate to draw one person from a commune, not too many. As for drawing accountants, they can only be drawn from communes with assistant accountants and assistants.

Second, constantly arming the minds of the commune guidance group members with the spirit of policy is the primary link in doing a good job of guidance. Xuchang area organized these two guidance groups, and before each departure, they first spent three or four days to specially study various mutual assistance and cooperation documents such as the commune charter, the "four assessments" method, and class policy; then, they summarized and improved the experience of the commune with the spirit of policy; and conducted trial lectures in order to unify ideas, unify guidance content, and avoid each person talking about their own set, resulting in deviations. In practical work, it also achieved timely discovery of problems, timely meeting research, and achieved consistent understanding and pace. Facts have proved that only by combining the experience of the old communes with the spirit of the Party's policies and the specific situation can the guidance group play a greater role.

Third, compiling a good guidance group is of decisive significance for doing a good job of guidance. The guidance group is the basic unit for conducting guidance activities, so it must be compiled well. From the situation of organizing guidance groups in Xuchang area these two times, the level of the old commune backbones is also different. When compiling groups, we must pay attention to the different strengths and weaknesses of reporting ability, the difference between men and women, the different division of labor of duties, the different types of representatives, etc., and match them appropriately, so that each group has all kinds of talents, so as to solve all kinds of problems.

Fourth, the activities of the guidance group must be combined with the work of the local county, district, and township, so as to communicate information and cooperate with each other. This not only enables the guidance group to regularly grasp the local situation, so as to conduct guidance work according to the symptoms, but also promotes the progress of various local work.

    合作化运动中的一个好的领导方法
    ——介绍许昌地区各级党委组织办社辅导团的经验
    宋海晏
    河南省许昌地区在去年冬天和今年春天发展农业生产合作社的工作中，曾经挑选有经验的老社干部和积极分子，组织成办社辅导团，帮助工作比较薄弱地区的建社和巩固社的工作。经验证明，这是和目前合作化大发展的新形势相适应的一个新的领导方法。
    新形势要求采取新的领导方法
    一九五四年冬天，许昌全区十五个县和三个市郊区，合作社由原有的二千一百一十七个发展到七千九百个；老社的户数也有所增加。入社农民占全区总农户的百分之十六点三二。大发展后产生了许多新问题，其中较突出的是领导赶不上运动发展的需要。越是互助合作基础薄弱的地区，这种情况就越突出。原先各地虽然也建立了不少“联社委员会”、“互助合作网”等组织，并且也确实起了很大作用；但是它们的作用范围毕竟只能限于一个乡或几个乡之内，那些遥隔几十里或几百里以外、互助合作基础薄弱的地区，是“网”也网不住，“联”也联不起来的。很显然，工作本身要求领导上采取一种新的领导方法。办社辅导团，就是适应这种新的情况产生的。办社辅导团的组织
    办社辅导团，是一种以先进的老社带动新社共同前进的方法。办社辅导团的组织方法有三种：一种是地委组织的，这种辅导团由地委农村工作部具体负责组成。参加成员，都是互助合作先进县的较好的合作社社长、社干部、积极分子，他们在地委集中以后，经过简短的学习和训练（一般是三天左右）编成若干辅导小组（每组以六人左右为宜），由地委派人带领，分赴各县进行巡回辅导。另外两种是县委或区委组织的办社辅导团，由县委农村工作部或区委负责组织、训练和派人领导，解决本县内或本区内薄弱区的问题。至于辅导团应该由什么样的骨干组成，要由当时组织辅导团的任务而定。去年冬天一次因为主要任务是帮助建社，所以当时就针对群众对建社的很多误解和顾虑，抽调了老社中有代表性的各种类型人物组成辅导团，以他们自己当初入社时的思想转变过程，现身说法，来打通别人思想。今年春天组织的一次因为主要任务是帮助新社巩固和转上生产，就针对当时多数社“四评”遗留问题较多、劳动组织混乱、生产没有计划、账目没有建立和评工记分不合理等情况，抽调了老社中有领导能力的男女正副社长、生产队长、会计等组织辅导团，以他们当初解决本社混乱问题的经验，去帮助新社迅速建立生产秩序，转上生产。这两次辅导的时间都在二十天左右。
     办社辅导团的活动方法
    办社辅导团的具体工作内容，主要是通过介绍自己社里的实际情况，向群众，特别是社员、组员说明党对农业合作化的方针、政策，说明合作社的优越性以及如何办社的一些具体经验。去年冬天建社的时候，辅导团就主要宣传农业合作社的优越性——宣传各种类型社员户增加收入的情况，宣传互助组发展到合作社步步登高的过程。今年春天在巩固社中，辅导团就主要宣传社刚建立后怎样由混乱纳入了生产正轨的经验，并且具体帮助一些新社处理了问题，使新社转上生产。此外，有些到过大城市的劳动模范（如苏殿选），还结合自己的所见所闻，宣传社会主义工业化和农业集体化的远景。辅导团团员所讲的都是他们自己的实际事情，讲起来不仅内容丰富，而且生动、具体，通俗易懂。
    办社辅导团的具体活动方式，主要的有以下三种：
    第一、大会报告结合小组座谈，传授办社经验。首先由一个人作全面综合性的报告，然后再由其他的人侧重某个方面或某个问题作补充发言；报告后即组织群众讨论酝酿，团员分头深入各小组，解决大家所提出的具体问题。这种方式解决问题的面宽，活动的场合也很多；有以区（或小区）为单位，分类（如社长、会计、队长等）或不分类专门召开社干部会进行的；也有趁着举行各种社干部会议或举办社干部训练班时进行的。但是，不管在什么场合下，要运用这种方式，都必须事前和当地区、乡干部接头，充分了解情况，准确地抓住当地社内存在的普遍和突出的问题，然后对症下药，才能收到应有的效果。
    第二、说和作相结合。具体做法是深入到一个重点社，帮助建社和巩固社，取得经验后再召开会议进行全面推广。宝丰县辅导分团今春在鄢陵县还在点面结合的基础上，建立了十五个长久性的互助合作网和会计网。
    第三、建立互助合作问事处。社、组群众提问题，辅导团解答问题，作到随问随答和有问必答。
    许昌地区去年冬天今年春天组织的两次办社辅导团（不包括区委组织的），共抽老社骨干九百零四人，组成了一百四十个辅导小组，前后在一百四十九个区和一千零五十八个乡中，组织大会报告和小会座谈；听众共三十六万四千八百九十二人。设立互助合作问事处解答疑难问题二千四百四十四件。
    辅导的效果
    许昌专区组织办社辅导团，对推动合作化运动前进，发挥了巨大作用。
    首先，有效地解决了合作化大发展带来的“社多干部少”和领导经验不足的问题。就以今年春天为例，当时各地领导精力，几乎全部集中到突击工作上。就在这个时候，不少的农业社（特别是新社）因为没有上级领导，问题不能得到及时解决，有趋于垮台的危险。当时，地委和各县委就组织了包括八百二十三名老社骨干的办社辅导团，先后到互助合作基础较差的各区、乡进行巡回辅导，他们帮助一千零九十三个社解决了问题，转上了生产。此外，还帮助新建和巩固了八十五个互助合作网和八十七个会计网，整顿和新建了许多互助组。值得特别指出的是，辅导团解决问题非常迅速。原因是当前新社所碰到的问题，正是老社已经解决、而且是已经取得解决经验教训的问题。
    其次，大大推动了当地生产运动的开展。辅导团的团员，不仅是老社的领导骨干，有领导农业集体经济的经验，而且也是生产当中的积极分子和生产能手，掌握着许多先进的生产技术。郏县辅导分团在扶沟县宋寨乡，以不足二十天的时间，不仅帮助该乡所有的十个合作社全部实行了小包工（内有四个实行季节包工），改进了劳动管理，提高了社员生产情绪，克服了窝工浪费现象；而且辅导团还通过查、算、对比和介绍自己社的生产经验等方法，帮助他们打破了当地的惯例，置买了茅缸，打了猪圈，修了厕所，换墙土，积草木灰等共积肥二千六百六十多车；提前拔掉地内花柴；并且帮助五个社开始了磨豆腐、弹花、轧花等副业生产。
    第三，辅导团所到之处，不仅仅给社、组以管理经验和生产技术的帮助，同时也提高了社员和组员的思想觉悟。由于辅导团包括有各种类型的社干部和社员，所以他们的发言对同样的农户和社干部，启发教育都很大。而且，这种辅导团到处大张旗鼓地作报告，传授办社经验，在农村也容易造成一种“声势”，很快就可以使“参加农业生产合作社”的运动成为舆论中心。另外，辅导团的团员还多是些著名的劳动模范，他们中有不少都参观过国家的工厂和到过大城市，因而见识广，懂得多；通过他们介绍自己的观感，不仅使到会听众看到了今天，同时也看到了明天。群众普遍反映：“辅导团说的条条是路、句句称心，毛主席指给咱的路——互助合作，是越走越明。”群众的办社信心空前高涨。
    第四，提高了辅导团团员本身的政治觉悟和办事能力，进一步加强和巩固了原有老社的骨干领导，对今后巩固老社提供了有利条件。辅导团的团员虽然都是些老社骨干，具有一定的工作经验和办事能力，但毕竟他们对政策的体会还不深刻，还往往会把处理本社问题的办法，看成是一成不变的“定理”，似乎在任何情况和任何条件下，都是“不可动摇”的。参加办社辅导团之后，经过学习党对互助合作的各项政策，和到外乡外县的巡回辅导，大大帮助他们克服了这种狭隘的经验主义的观点；使他们学会了依照党的政策精神，根据各种不同情况，采取不同方法去处理问题的本领。在这种基础上，有的社长还主动检查了本社存在的问题，提出回家后解决的办法。不少的辅导团团员事后都这样说：“参加一次辅导团，真比专门学习两月还提高得快。”
    应当注意的问题
    从以上的初步经验来看，必须注意如下事项，才能更好发挥办社辅导团的作用，收到更大效果。
    第一、在着手组织辅导团的时候，成员一定要经过慎重的选择——一定要找政治觉悟较高，社办的较好，增产较多，而且有办事能力的社长或社员。但是，另方面也要注意老社的巩固和提高；一般说，一个社抽一人为宜，不可过多。至于抽会计，只有在有辅助会计和有助手的社内才可抽调。
    第二、不断用政策精神武装办社辅导团团员的思想，是搞好辅导工作的首要环节。许昌地区组织这两次辅导团，每次出发之前，都首先以三、四天时间，专门学习了社章、“四评”方法、阶级政策等各种互助合作文件；继而用政策精神把本社经验加以总结提高；并进行试讲，以便统一思想，统一辅导内容，免得各人讲各人的一套，发生偏差。在实际工作中，也作到了及时发现问题，及时碰头研究，取得认识和步调的始终一致。事实证明：只有把老社的经验和党的政策精神、具体情况三者结合起来，辅导团才能发挥更大的作用。
    第三、编好辅导小组，对搞好辅导工作有决定性的意义。辅导小组是进行辅导活动的基本单位，所以必须把组编好。从许昌地区这两次组织辅导团的情况来看，老社骨干的水平也是不一样的。编组的时候，必须注意到报告能力强弱的不同，男女性别的不同，职务分工的不同，代表类型的不同等等，适当进行搭配，务使每个组内各样的人材都有，以便解决各式各样的问题。
    第四、辅导团的活动，必须和当地县、区、乡的工作结合起来，以便互通情况，互相配合。这不仅使辅导团能经常掌握当地情况，以便对症下药进行辅导工作，而且还能推动当地各种工作前进。
