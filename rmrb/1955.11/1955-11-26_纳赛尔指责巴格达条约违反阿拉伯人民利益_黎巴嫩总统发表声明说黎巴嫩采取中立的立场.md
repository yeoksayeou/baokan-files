　　Nasser Accuses Baghdad Pact of Violating Interests of Arab People
　　Lebanese President Issues Statement Saying Lebanon Takes Neutral Stance
　　Xinhua News Agency, November 25th, TASS Cairo, November 24th: According to newspaper reports, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser told an ANSA news agency reporter that the Baghdad Pact violates the national interests of the Arab people, "its aim is to divide the Arabs."
　　Nasser pointed out that the bilateral treaties between Egypt and Syria, and between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, are "purely defensive."
　　Nasser also said that in order to ensure its own defense, the Egyptian government is extremely concerned with equipping its armed forces properly and dispelling attempts by Western countries to put pressure on Egypt by using the issue of arms sales. Nasser said, "Western countries should know that Egypt is a free country, not anyone's protectorate, and taking care of our armed forces is entirely our own business."
　　Prime Minister Nasser believes that the claim that Egypt's purchase of Czechoslovakian weapons will create an "arms race" in the Near East is untenable.
　　Nasser finally said that the tripartite declaration issued by Western countries in 1950 regarding guaranteeing the status quo in the Middle East has not been able to promote the cause of peace.
　　Xinhua News Agency, November 25th, TASS Beirut, November 24th: According to "Al Anwar" newspaper, Lebanese President Camille Chamoun issued a statement saying that Lebanon's interests require Lebanon to take a neutral stance and not conclude any alliances or conventions.
　　He said: To allow Lebanon to belong to either of the two major world camps is not permissible, because Lebanon's highest interest is to maintain friendly relations with all countries.
　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Beirut: British Foreign Secretary Macmillan arrived in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, by plane on the 23rd after attending the Prime Ministers' meeting of the Baghdad Pact member states in Baghdad. Macmillan met with Lebanese President Camille Chamoun that day, and held talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Karami and Foreign Minister Lahoud. According to a UPI report, Macmillan talked to Chamoun about the "benefits" of joining the Baghdad Pact.

　　纳赛尔指责巴格达条约违反阿拉伯人民利益
    黎巴嫩总统发表声明说黎巴嫩采取中立的立场
    新华社二十五日讯　塔斯社开罗二十四日讯：据报纸报道，埃及总理纳赛尔向安莎通讯社记者发表谈话说，巴格达条约是违反阿拉伯人民的民族利益的，“它的目的是在分裂阿拉伯人”。
    纳赛尔指出，埃及和叙利亚之间以及埃及和沙特阿拉伯之间的双边条约“纯粹是防御性的”。
    纳赛尔还说，埃及政府为了使自己的防御有保障，极为关心使自己的武装部队获得应有的装备，并且打消西方国家利用供售武器的问题来对埃及施加压力的企图。纳赛尔说，“西方国家应当知道，埃及是一个自由的国家，而不是谁的保护国，关怀我们的武装部队完全是我们自己的事”。
    有人硬说埃及购买捷克斯洛伐克的武器将在近东造成“军备竞赛”，纳赛尔总理认为这种说法是站不住脚的。
    纳赛尔最后说，西方国家在一九五零年发表的关于保障中东现状的三国宣言并没有能够促进和平事业。
    新华社二十五日讯　塔斯社贝鲁特二十四日讯：据“凡事报”报道，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙发表声明说，黎巴嫩的利益要求黎巴嫩采取中立的立场，并且不缔结任何同盟和公约。
    他说：要想使黎巴嫩归附于两大世界阵营中的任何一个是不能允许的，因为，黎巴嫩的最高利益就是同所有国家都保持友好关系。
    据新华社讯贝鲁特消息：英国外交大臣麦克米伦在出席巴格达条约参加国总理会议后，二十三日从巴格达乘飞机到达黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特。麦克米伦当天会见了黎巴嫩总统夏蒙，并且同黎巴嫩总理卡拉米和外交部长拉霍德举行了会谈。据合众社消息说，麦克米伦曾向夏蒙谈论关于参加巴格达条约的“好处”。
