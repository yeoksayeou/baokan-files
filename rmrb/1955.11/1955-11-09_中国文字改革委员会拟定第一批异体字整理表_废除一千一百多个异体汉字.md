    China Language Reform Committee Drafts First List of Standardized Variant Characters
    Abolishing Over 1,100 Variant Chinese Characters
    In order to reduce the number of Chinese characters, the China Language Reform Committee has drafted the "First List of Standardized Variant Characters." This list has been approved by the recently held National Language Reform Conference, and all publishing and printing organizations are required to abolish this batch of variant characters in publications.
    In January of this year, the "Draft List of 400 Variant Characters to be Abolished," included in the "Draft Plan for Simplifying Chinese Characters" published by the China Language Reform Committee, elicited many opinions after discussions by cultural and educational workers and people from all walks of life in various regions. Based on these opinions, the China Language Reform Committee made preliminary revisions to this draft, along with materials on handling variant characters in proofreading work collected from Beijing newspapers and publishing houses. This was compiled into a preliminary draft and sent to Beijing news and publishing units for feedback. Then, the China Language Reform Committee convened a meeting of the original units that provided feedback to discuss the principles of standardizing variant characters. At the meeting, representatives from the People's Daily, Guangming Daily, People's Education Press, China Youth Publishing House, and the China Language Reform Committee jointly revised the preliminary draft. The revised draft was then discussed and approved by representatives of the original units that provided feedback, and was named the "Draft First List of Standardized Variant Characters."
    The "First List of Standardized Variant Characters" now approved by the National Language Reform Conference lists a total of over 800 groups of variant characters, with a minimum of two characters and a maximum of six characters per group, totaling over 1,900 characters. After standardization, more than 1,100 characters can be streamlined from the currently used Chinese characters.
    This first batch of variant characters includes the vast majority of commonly used variant characters in books and newspapers. Variant characters not included in the list but which may be discovered in the future will be processed in the second batch.

    中国文字改革委员会拟定第一批异体字整理表
    废除一千一百多个异体汉字
    中国文字改革委员会为了减少汉字数目，拟定了“第一批异体字整理表”。这个整理表已经最近举行的全国文字改革会议通过，并要求各出版和印刷机关在出版物上废除这一批异体字。
    今年一月间中国文字改革委员会发表的“汉字简化方案草案”中包括“拟废除的四百个异体字表草案”，各地文化教育工作者和各界人士讨论以后，提出了许多意见。中国文字改革委员会根据这些意见对这个草案作了初步的修正，连同所征集到的北京各报社、各出版社关于校对工作方面处理异体字的材料，编成初稿，送请北京新闻出版单位提意见，再由中国文字改革委员会召集原来提意见的各单位开会讨论异体字整理原则。会上推出人民日报社、光明日报社、人民教育出版社、中国青年出版社等五单位的代表和中国文字改革委员会共同把初稿加以修正，再请原提意见各单位的代表开会讨论通过，名为“第一批异体字整理表草案”。
    现在经全国文字改革会议通过的“第一批异体字整理表”所列异体字共八百多组，每组最少二字，最多六字，合计一千九百多字。经过整理后，可以从现在通用汉字中精简一千一百多字。
    这第一批异体字，包含书报上通用异体字的极大部分。未列入表内而以后可能发现的异体字，将作为第二批处理。
