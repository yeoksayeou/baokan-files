Guangxi Province Achieves Bumper Harvest of Shatang Citrus

　　The Rongxian and Pingle Special Districts of Guangxi Province, which are major producers of Shatang citrus, have generally achieved a bumper harvest of Shatang citrus this year. The output of Rongxian Special District alone is 3.61 million this year, an increase of 63% over last year. The twelve major Shatang citrus producing counties in Rongxian and Pingle Special Districts produced a total of about 6.7 million Shatang citrus this year.
