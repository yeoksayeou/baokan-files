Calculate the Production Achievements of Female Commune Members

　　In many agricultural cooperatives, mobilizing women to participate in production is often seen as optional. One of the reasons is that many people still do not see how much value women's labor can create, and there is also a tendency to underestimate women. In the Qinxi Village Agricultural Cooperative in Chenggu County, Shaanxi Province, more than thirty women, in addition to participating in the cooperative's field work this year, also selected ten women to specialize in raising silkworms for a season. This sideline business was done exclusively by women, so the results of their labor were obvious. The silk they reeled from the silkworms was sold for 325 yuan. After deducting all investments and silkworm raising work point remuneration, the cooperative had a net profit of more than 80 yuan. This money was used to buy a cow for the cooperative and also to buy twenty sets of palm fiber raincoats for the male commune members. The male commune members originally did not pay enough attention to silkworm rearing, but now they do. They have sown several mu of mulberry fields this year and plan to sow more than twenty mu in a few years. Some male commune members originally looked down on women, saying, "What can they do?" Now their views on women have also changed. Some people say: To develop production, we can't do without women!
    In those cooperatives where some people still underestimate women's strength, it is best to calculate the production achievements of women. This is good for changing the idea of underestimating women, and it is also good for encouraging women to participate in production.

　　算一算女社员的生产成绩
    在许多农业合作社里，常常把发动妇女参加生产看做可有可无的事。原因之一是许多人还看不见妇女劳动能够创造多少价值，还有轻视妇女的思想。陕西省城固县秦西村农业合作社的三十多户妇女，今年除了参加社里田间的农活以外，又抽了十个妇女专门养了一季蚕。这桩副业是妇女专门干的，妇女的劳动成绩就明显地看出来了。她们养的蚕缫丝卖了三百二十五元钱，除去一切投资和养蚕工分报酬，社里净得八十多元。这笔钱给社里买了一头牛，还给男社员买了二十件雨天披的棕衣。男社员们原来对养蚕不够重视，现在也重视了，今年播种了几亩桑田，计划过几年播种到二十多亩。有些男社员原来看不起妇女，说“她们做得了啥？”现在对妇女的看法也改变了，有的人说：要发展生产，可少不了妇女呀！
    在那些还有人轻视妇女力量的社里，最好把妇女的生产成绩算一算。这对改变轻视妇女的思想有好处，对鼓励妇女参加生产也有好处。
