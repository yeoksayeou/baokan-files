　　Long-Span Stone Arch Bridges Completed on the Southern Section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway
    All thirty-three long-span stone arch bridges on the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway have been completed. This is the first time in the history of railway construction in our country that such a large number of long-span stone arch bridges have been built.
    Using stone arch bridges can save steel and cement. The completion of this batch of stone arch bridges also provides experience for building a large number of stone arch bridges in mountainous areas in the future.
    The technology for building long-span stone arch bridges is relatively complex, and cracks can easily occur in the bridge body if it is not built well. When the southern section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway began to build long-span stone arch bridges in 1953, cracks occurred in the bridge body. Later, after research by the engineering and technical personnel of the Second Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways' Newly Built Railways, the sectioning method and the order of installation of each section were re-determined, so that cracks no longer occurred in the bridge body.

### 宝成路南段长跨度石拱桥完工

　　宝成路南段长跨度石拱桥完工
    宝成铁路南段三十三座长跨度石拱桥已全部完工。这样大量建筑长跨度石拱桥，在我国铁路修建史上还是第一次。
    采用石拱桥可以节省钢筋水泥。这批石拱桥工程完工，也为今后在山区修建铁路大量建筑石拱桥创造了经验。
    修建长跨度石拱桥的技术比较复杂，造得不好桥身容易发生裂缝。宝成铁路南段在一九五三年开始修建长跨度石拱桥的时候，桥身就发生过裂缝。后来经铁道部新建铁路第二工程局的工程技术人员的研究，重新确定了分段的办法和各段安砌的次序，使桥身不再发生裂缝。（新华社）
