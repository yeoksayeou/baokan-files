Shelterbelts to be Built in the Wugong Village Area of Raoyang

    The Hebei Provincial People's Committee recently conducted a survey and design work for farmland protective forests in fifty agricultural production cooperatives near Wugong Village, Raoyang County. The plan is to build a 310-kilometer-long shelterbelt on 110,000 mu of cultivated land seriously affected by wind and sand, to combat the gales and drifting sand that endanger crops.

    The entire project is scheduled to be completed in 1957, and the shelterbelt will be effective within three to five years after completion. After ten years, when all the trees have grown, 110,000 mu of cultivated land will be able to preserve seedlings, retain moisture, and maintain soil fertility in the spring, and reduce the impact of strong winds and rainstorms in the autumn. The yield of crops such as wheat, corn, peanuts, and cotton will increase by 30% compared to the original yield. The total annual increase in grain and cotton production for the country will be more than 10,620,000 jin. In addition, annual income from timber, fruits, and other products can reach more than 680,000 yuan.

　　饶阳五公村一带将营造防风林
    河北省人民委员会最近在饶阳县五公村附近进行了五十个农业生产合作社的农田防护林的调查设计工作。计划在风砂危害严重的十一万亩耕地面积上，营造一条长三百十公里的防风林带，来向危害庄稼的暴风、流砂作斗争。
    整个工程计划在一九五七年完成，林带完成后三、五年内即能发挥作用。十年后，树林全部长成，将使十一万亩耕地在春季可以保苗、保墒、保地力，在秋季可以减免狂风暴雨袭击，小麦、玉米、花生、棉花等农作物将比原产量提高百分之三十。每年共可给国家增产粮棉一千零六十二万多斤。此外，每年木材、果品等收入也可达六十八万多元。
