Transforming Backward Villages and Carrying Out the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
Zhang Fengwu, Secretary of the CPC Jiangjin Prefectural Committee

	This autumn, the CPC Jiangjin Prefectural Committee of Sichuan Province, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, concentrated its efforts on solving the problems of backward villages in the region. Now, the problems of most backward villages have been basically resolved, clearing the way for the great development of the agricultural cooperative movement. A portion of the backward villages where problems have not been thoroughly resolved will need supplementary work during this winter's grain purchase and supply and cooperative planning to completely resolve the issues.

	The Jiangjin area originally had 1,165 backward villages, accounting for more than 17 percent of the total number of villages in the region. Some of these backward villages were where land reform and the suppression of counter-revolutionaries had not been thoroughly carried out, and some had deteriorated later. The methods adopted by counter-revolutionaries were threefold: one was to conceal their status and identity, pretend to be progressive, and infiltrate our grassroots organizations to directly control leadership; another was to send relatives, lackeys, and henchmen to infiltrate as agents; and the third was to threaten and entice party members and cadres, causing them to degenerate and serve them. For example, Lianhua Village in Zuantang Township, Qijiang County, was a backward village that several suppression of counter-revolutionaries campaigns had failed to crack open. This village had one branch secretary and one group leader of the reactionary Youth Party, two heads of reactionary secret societies, five former chiefs of the Baojia system, and two ringleaders of bandits and habitual bandits, totaling eighteen people. However, since liberation, these people had never been struck down, and the village leadership remained in their hands. The original village chief, Liu Zaikui, was a member of the Youth League, and he sheltered all the counter-revolutionaries in the village. Therefore, the counter-revolutionaries were very happy and said, "Thank him for being a cadre; otherwise, our village would have had countless heads chopped off." The village representative director, Chen Zhanyun, was also a fourth-level member of the "Convenience Sect" (a type of reactionary secret society). This counter-revolutionary harbored bandits and robbed People's Liberation Army vehicles. When Chen Zhanyun celebrated his birthday, the counter-revolutionaries held a grand banquet to congratulate him and took the opportunity to carry out activities. The village peasant association director, Li Xueqing, although from a poor peasant background, was completely controlled by his uncle, who had been a former Bao chief for eight years, and had to consult him beforehand and report to him afterward in everything he did. This village had three Communist Party members, two of whom were colluding with counter-revolutionaries, and the other was not active in his work. When district and township cadres came to this village, they had no way to carry out their work. The masses all said, "Our village has not yet been liberated; those people (counter-revolutionaries) are still in power." Another example is the former police chief of Mafang Township, Bishan County, Pu Tingwen, who seduced the party's township branch secretary with his daughter, Pu Zejun. The branch secretary handed over all the documents and keys to Pu Zejun for safekeeping and promoted Pu's entire family to be cadres: Pu Tingwen himself became the mutual aid team leader, Pu's first wife became the director of the township women's representative, the concubine became the village women's group leader, the daughter became the township Youth League secretary, and the son became the grain depot's trader.

	The reason why these backward villages have not been transformed for a long time, and why counter-revolutionaries have been able to roam free for so long, is mainly due to the impurity of grassroots organizations. Therefore, to thoroughly solve the problems of backward villages, to dig out the counter-revolutionaries in backward villages, it is necessary to closely integrate the suppression of counter-revolutionaries with the rectification of grassroots organizations. Otherwise, the enemy cannot be defeated.

	In order to solve this problem, the Jiangjin Prefectural Committee convened a three-level cadre meeting above the district committee secretary level, and each county committee convened a three-level cadre meeting above the township branch secretary level, criticizing right-leaning paralysis and initially figuring out the basis of the backward villages. Immediately afterward, with the county as the unit and under the leadership of the county committee, a rural party member congress was convened (villages with no or few party members invited activists to attend), seriously criticizing the ideas of complacency and right-leaning thinking, and mobilizing the broad masses of party members and cadres to expose the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries. The development process of the meeting was as follows: the exposure of the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries gradually deepened from ordinary villages to backward villages, from the outside to the inside, from outside the meeting to inside the meeting, and from shallow to deep; the criticism of party members and cadres' right-leaning thoughts and erroneous actions gradually deepened from criticizing carelessness and paralysis to failing to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, losing our stand, and finally to degenerating, also from shallow to deep. Moreover, the two were mutually causal, that is, the deeper the exposure, the higher the awareness of party members, and the higher the awareness of party members, the deeper the exposure. When the meeting exposed the counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the meeting, the struggle was very fierce, everyone was very nervous, and some people showed concern and unease. These people's concerns and unease were due to three reasons: one was that they were ideologically right-leaning and feared retaliation after the counter-revolutionaries were exposed and arrested. Another was that they themselves had some problems: some had committed coercive orders or violated laws and disciplines, some had certain connections with counter-revolutionaries and had some cover-ups for counter-revolutionaries, and some had some problems in history, such as having participated in reactionary parties, groups, and reactionary secret societies (having confessed or not confessed), and feared being punished by party discipline and the law. The third type of people were bad elements who had infiltrated or been dragged into the water. For these people, the meeting adopted different methods to solve their ideological problems and made different treatments. For people with right-leaning ideas, the main thing was to further criticize right-leaning ideas, raise their class consciousness, and strengthen their fighting will, so that they would hate the enemy and resolutely fight against the enemy. For people with problems themselves, they were told clearly about the boundaries between coercive orders and violations of laws and disciplines, losing their stand and degenerating, patiently educated and helped them, raised their awareness, made them realize their mistakes, correct their mistakes, eliminate their concerns, and stand up to resolutely fight against the enemy. For bad elements, they were told about the policy of leniency for confession and urged them to thoroughly confess their problems. Some who had serious circumstances were dismissed from their posts for investigation, and individual counter-revolutionaries who had committed great crimes, aroused great public anger, and had conclusive evidence but resolutely resisted were arrested on the spot in accordance with the law to prevent them from leaking secrets, escaping, committing suicide, retaliating, and sabotaging.

	After in-depth mobilization and fierce struggle within the party, the lid covering up the counter-revolutionaries was removed, and finally the roots of the counter-revolution were dug out. More than 20,000 pieces of material exposing the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries were uncovered throughout the region. After investigation, verification, and strict examination and approval procedures, a number of counter-revolutionaries and various criminals were arrested in accordance with the law, and a large number of reactionary documents, guns, bullets, poisons, etc. were seized. After the arrests, publicity was carried out vigorously through township people's representative conferences, district party member conferences, public trials, village meetings, exhibitions, group discussions, propaganda networks, and individual connections, educating party members and the masses to raise their vigilance and report counter-revolutionaries. More than 400 propaganda teams and 1,746 propaganda groups were organized throughout the region, with a total of 92,698 participants. Fifty-nine public trials were held, with 69,475 people attending. In addition, a large number of notices were posted and various propaganda materials were printed and distributed. After the arrests, public trials, and vigorous publicity, the masses' awareness was further raised, and they rose up to report counter-revolutionaries. When Jiulong Township, Yongchuan County, escorted the prisoners through Pulian Market, the masses all surrounded them and said, "It's good to arrest these guys; it's good for the autumn harvest and for setting up cooperatives."

	This suppression of counter-revolutionaries was greatly satisfying to the people and greatly promoted the agricultural cooperative movement. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, the masses actively visited old cooperatives to prepare for setting up cooperatives. The masses understood that only by organizing to increase production can the restoration of counter-revolutionaries be avoided. In the past, the leadership of Taiping Village, Jiulong Township, Rongchang County, was controlled by counter-revolutionaries, and party members, youth league members, and the masses were very depressed. This time, after five counter-revolutionaries were arrested, party members and youth league members became active, and the masses were happy. Two new agricultural production cooperatives have been established in the village, with farmer households accounting for 29.4 percent of the total farmer households. Facts have proved that as long as the counter-revolutionaries in backward villages are arrested, cooperatives can be established, and only by establishing cooperatives and making socialism occupy the position can the results of the suppression of counter-revolutionaries be consolidated.

### 改造落后乡村和开展农业合作化运动

    改造落后乡村和开展农业合作化运动
    中共江津地委书记　张风伍
    今年秋季，中共四川省江津地委根据党中央的指示，集中力量解决本区的落后乡村问题。现在大部分落后乡村的问题，已经基本上得到解决，为农业合作化运动的大发展扫除了障碍。一部分问题解决得不彻底的落后乡村，需要在今年冬季粮食统购统销和合作化规划中进行补课，以便把问题彻底地解决。
    江津地区原有落后村一千一百六十五个，占全区总村数百分之十七以上。这些落后村一部分是土地改革和镇压反革命运动没有搞彻底的，一部分是后来又变坏的。反革命分子所采用的手段有三种：一种是隐瞒成份和身份，伪装进步，混入我们的基层组织直接掌握领导权；另一种是派亲属、爪牙和狗腿子钻进来作代理人；第三种是威胁利诱党员干部，使党员干部蜕化变质，为他们服务。如綦江县篆塘乡莲花村，是几次镇压反革命运动都没有打开的落后村。这个村有反动青年党的支部长一人、小组长一人，反动会道门头子二人，伪保长五人，伪保队副五人，匪首、惯匪各二人，共计十八人。但是解放以来，这些人从没有受过打击，村领导权仍然掌握在他们手里。原来的村长刘再奎就是青年党员，庇护着全村的反革命分子，所以反革命分子很高兴地说：“感谢他作了干部，不然我们村上不知要敲多少沙罐（砍多少脑袋）。”村代表主任陈展云又是“方便门”（一种反动会道门）的四层。这个反革命分子窝藏土匪，抢劫人民解放军的车子。陈展云过生日的时候，反革命分子大摆宴席给他祝贺，并乘机进行活动。村农民协会主任李学清虽然是贫农出身、但是完全被他的当过八年伪保长的叔父所掌握，遇事必须事前请示：事后报告才行。这个村有三个共产党员，有两个同反革命分子有勾结，另一个工作也不积极。区和乡的干部到这村，根本没办法进行工作。群众都说：“我们村还没有解放，当道的还是那些人（反革命分子）。”再如璧山县马坊乡的伪警保队长蒲廷文，用女儿蒲泽君勾引上了党的乡支部书记。支部书记把所有的文件和钥匙都交给蒲泽君保管，并提拔蒲的全家人当了干部：蒲廷文本人当互助组组长，蒲的大老婆当乡妇女代表主任，小老婆当村妇女组长，女儿当乡团支部书记，儿子当了粮库的交易员。
    这些落后乡村所以长期没有改造，反革命分子一窝窝的长期逍遥法外，主要是由于基层组织不纯而来的。因此要彻底解决落后乡村的问题，要把落后乡村的反革命分子挖出来，必须把镇压反革命同整顿基层组织紧密结合起来进行。不然，是打不倒敌人的。
    为了解决这个问题，江津地委召开了区委书记以上的三级干部会议，各县委召开了乡支部书记以上的三级干部会议，批判了右倾麻痹思想，初步摸清了落后乡村的底子。紧接着又以县为单位，在县委的主持下，召开了农村党员大会（没有党员和党员少的村邀请积极分子列席），严肃地批判了太平观念和右倾思想，动员广大党员干部揭发反革命分子的破坏活动。会议发展的过程是这样：揭发反革命分子的破坏活动是由一般乡村到落后乡村，由外部到内部，由会外到会内，由浅而深逐步深入的；批判党员干部的右倾思想和错误行动是由批判轻敌麻痹，再到敌我不分、丧失立场，最后到蜕化变质，也是由浅而深逐步深入的。而且这两者互为因果，就是揭发越深，党员觉悟越高，党员觉悟越高，揭发得越深。当会议揭发到混进会内的反革命分子的时候，斗争十分激烈，大家情绪十分紧张，并有一些人表现出有顾虑和不安。这些人的顾虑和不安有三种原因：一种人是思想右倾，怕把反革命分子揭发和逮捕以后受到报复。另一种人是本身有些问题：有的是有强迫命令或违法乱纪行为，有的是同反革命分子有一定联系，对反革命分子有一些包庇，有的是历史上有些问题，如曾参加过反动党团和反动会道门（已经交代或没有交代），怕受到党纪国法的制裁。第三种人是钻进来或是被拉下水的坏分子。对于这些人，会议上采取了不同的方法解决他们的思想问题和作了不同的处理。对有右倾思想的人，主要是进一步批判右倾思想，提高他们的阶级觉悟，坚定他们的斗争意志，使他们仇恨敌人并且坚决同敌人作斗争。对本身有问题的人，就同他们讲清楚强迫命令和违法乱纪、丧失立场和蜕化变质等问题的界限，耐心教育帮助他们，提高他们的觉悟，使他们认识错误，改正错误，消除顾虑，挺起腰来坚决同敌人作斗争。对坏分子，是向他们讲清坦白从宽的政策，促使他们彻底交代自己的问题，一部分情节严重的实行撤职查究，个别罪恶大、民愤大、证据确凿而又坚决抗拒的反革命分子，当场依法逮捕，以防止他们泄密、逃跑、自杀、报复和破坏。
    经过党内深入的动员和激烈的斗争，把庇护反革命分子的盖子揭掉，最后才把反革命的根子挖出来。全区共揭发出反革命分子破坏的材料两万多份，经过调查对证和严格的审查批准手续，就依法逮捕了一批反革命分子和各种犯罪分子，并且缴获了大批的反动证件、枪支、子弹、毒药等等。逮捕以后，就通过乡的人民代表大会会议、区的党员大会、公审大会、村民大会、展览会、小组座谈会、宣传网和个别串连等方式，大张旗鼓地展开了宣传，教育党内外群众提高警惕性，检举反革命分子。全区组织宣传队四百多个，宣传组一千七百四十六个，参加的人数共有九万二千六百九十八人。召开公审大会五十九次，到会群众六万九千四百七十五人。此外还大量张贴了布告、印发了各种宣传品。经过逮捕、公审和大张旗鼓地宣传，群众的觉悟更提高了，纷纷起来检举反革命分子。永川县九龙乡把犯人押着经过普莲场的时候，群众都围上来说：“逮这些家伙逮得好，逮了好秋收，好办社。”
    这次镇压反革命运动，大快人心，并且大大地推进了农业合作化运动。镇压反革命运动后，群众积极访问老社准备办社。群众懂得了组织起来增加生产，才能避免反革命复辟。荣昌县九龙乡太平村的领导权过去被反革命分子所掌握，党员团员和群众都很消沉。这次逮捕了五个反革命分子，党团员都积极起来了，群众也高兴了，村里已经新建立起两个农业生产合作社，入社农户占总农户的百分之二十九点四。事实证明：只要把落后村的反革命分子逮捕起来，就可以建社，也只有把社建立起来，使社会主义占领了阵地，才能巩固镇压反革命的成果。
