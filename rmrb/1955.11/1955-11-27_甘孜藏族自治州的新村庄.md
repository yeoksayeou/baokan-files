　  New Villages in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
    In a valley in the southwest of Qianning County, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province (formerly Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Xikang Province), what was once a wilderness three years ago is now a village - Zhemaitong Village.
    Zhemaitong Village was established as follows: In 1952, the People's Government allocated a portion of this wasteland to eight landless and land-poor farmers for cultivation, provided them with a loan of 2,000 catties of grain, and distributed more than 30 pieces of farm tools free of charge. The following year, after these eight farmers harvested their crops, they attracted more farmers to the village. By the time of the autumn harvest this year, there were more than twenty households in the village.
    In Kangding, Yajiang, Ganzi, and Litang counties of the autonomous prefecture, there are some newly established villages like this. Litang County alone has four in one district.
    In these villages, people are very united and harmonious. Some of them have even been elected as county labor models and county people's representatives. With the help of agricultural technology guidance stations, farmers in many villages have also learned to use new-style animal-drawn farm implements and techniques such as seed selection and strip planting. After this year's autumn harvest, most of these formerly landless and land-poor farmers have built new houses and generally raised livestock. (Xinhua News Agency)

　  甘孜藏族自治州的新村庄
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州（原西康省藏族自治州）乾宁县西南的一个山谷，三年前还是一片荒地，现在这里已经是一个村庄——哲麦通村了。
    哲麦通村是这样建立起来的：一九五二年，人民政府把这块荒地的一部分调剂给八户无地和少地农民耕种，并且向他们贷放了二千斤口粮，无偿地发放了三十多件农具。第二年，这八户农民收了庄稼以后，便吸引了更多的农民到村庄里来。到今年秋收时候，全村就有了二十多户人家。
    在自治州的康定、雅江、甘孜和理塘等县，都有一些像这样建立起来的新村庄。仅理塘县一个区就有四个。
    在这些村庄里，人们都很团结和睦。他们当中有的人还当选了县劳动模范和县人民代表。不少村庄的农民还在农业技术指导站的帮助下，学会使用新式畜力农具，和选种、条播等技术。今年秋收以后，这些从前无地、少地的农民大都盖了新房屋，还普遍养了家畜。　（新华社）
