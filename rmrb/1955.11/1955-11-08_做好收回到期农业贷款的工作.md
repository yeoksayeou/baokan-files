With the vigorous development of the agricultural cooperation movement and the year-by-year expansion of agricultural production plans, it is expected that the state will issue twice as many agricultural loans next year as it did this year. The source of this fund, in addition to the continued allocation of a portion from the state's finances, will rely on the recovery of overdue agricultural loans this autumn and winter for revolving solutions. At the same time, during the peak season for purchasing, currency issuance in the market is concentrated. In addition to doing a good job of supplying commodities and absorbing savings to withdraw currency, timely recovery of overdue agricultural loans is also an important aspect of withdrawing currency and stabilizing the market.

This year, the whole country has generally achieved a bumper harvest. About 80% of agricultural production cooperatives have increased production, and the continuous improvement of the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants, as well as the accumulation of certain experiences by rural financial departments in various regions in recovering overdue agricultural loans, are all favorable conditions for doing a good job in recovering agricultural loans this year. This means that as long as we strengthen the organization and leadership of the loan recovery work, the task of recovering overdue agricultural loans will definitely be completed.

However, the progress of the current work of recovering overdue agricultural loans is not satisfactory. The loan recovery work in many areas of the country is progressing very slowly. What is the reason for this? This is mainly because some rural workers do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of recovering overdue agricultural loans, which hinders the progress of this work. They believe that issuing loans is to support cooperation and production, and that recovering loans will be detrimental to cooperation and production. Therefore, they not only do not actively recover overdue loans, but even suppress the enthusiasm of the masses to repay loans. For example, the Songcun Third Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, originally planned to repay 400 yuan, but the stationed staff only allowed them to repay 200 yuan. The Hecaojiao Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Ninth District of Fuping County, Shaanxi Province, had already planned to offer 1,150 jin of wheat to repay the loan, but the stationed staff did not allow them to repay it, asking them to keep it for cooperative expenses. A staff member in the Fengmiao District of Lingbi County, Anhui Province, even threatened the staff member in charge of recovering agricultural loans, saying: "If recovering agricultural loans collapses the cooperative, you will be responsible." These staff members' practices are obviously wrong. Mobilizing cooperatives and peasants to repay overdue loans in a timely manner will not only not affect the consolidation of the cooperative and the development of production, but on the contrary, it can strengthen the cooperative's planning in operation and management, which is conducive to the consolidation of the cooperative and the development of production. Some staff members also believe that this year is a year of bumper harvest, and there is no need to worry about recovering the loans. Under the control of this blind optimism, they have relaxed the organization and leadership of the work of recovering agricultural loans, resulting in the loan recovery work being left to its own devices. Another situation worth noting is that in the work of recovering agricultural loans, some staff members dare not explain to the masses the policy of "repay all that can be repaid, repay a part that can be repaid, and postpone repayment for those who cannot repay at all," fearing that they will not be able to complete the task of recovering agricultural loans if they explain the policy. They do not conduct investigation and research on the situation of borrowers and take care of the repayment ability of the masses. In order to pursue the figures for recovering agricultural loans, they do not even pay attention to the working methods, resulting in the phenomenon of "debt forcing" in some areas, which has caused a very bad influence among the masses and brought great damage to the work.

In order to do a good job of recovering overdue agricultural loans, all localities must combine the loan recovery work with the central work under the unified leadership of the Party organization, so that the loan recovery work becomes an integral part of the entire rural work. Before the work of recovering agricultural loans, it is necessary to correct and improve the ideological understanding of cadres, educate cadres to conduct in-depth investigation and research, and find out the repayment ability of the masses; at the same time, it is necessary to carry out publicity and education work on loan repayment to the masses. It is necessary to make the borrowing peasants understand that the state's recovery of overdue loans is to raise funds for issuing more agricultural loans next year. At present, after peasants sell agricultural products, it is the most economically affluent time. Timely repayment of loans can not only plan their own use of money in a planned way, so as to avoid spending money casually, but also reduce the burden of interest by repaying loans in a timely manner. The publicity of policies to loan households should be combined with the local actual situation, and the masses should be told which households should repay in full, which households can temporarily repay part of the loan, and which households can postpone repayment; individual loan households who have the ability to repay but deliberately do not repay can be appropriately criticized and educated by the masses. In this way, the masses can be encouraged to actively repay overdue loans, and the masses' mentality of comparing and waiting and the idea of waiting for reduction and exemption can be eliminated. In this year's loan recovery work, Yugan County, Jiangxi Province, found out the actual repayment ability of the masses, comprehensively implemented the policies, and carried out in-depth publicity and education to the masses, so that the masses understood the benefits of timely repayment of overdue loans to the country and themselves. Therefore, the recovery of agricultural loans was carried out very smoothly. In more than a month from August 5th to September 12th, the county completed 75.7% of the annual loan recovery plan.

Up to now, there are more than 153,000 rural credit cooperatives in various localities, and more than 80% of the townships across the country have established credit cooperatives; this is a powerful rural financial force. Local banks must rely well on these credit cooperatives in the work of recovering agricultural loans. Doing so can not only ensure the smooth progress of the work of recovering agricultural loans and reduce the difficulty of insufficient personnel in banking institutions, but also promote the development of credit cooperative business and the consolidation of the cooperative. However, at present, due to the large proportion of newly established credit cooperatives, the cadres' policy level is low, and they have little work experience. Therefore, the Party committees and banks in various localities must strengthen the inspection, supervision, and specific assistance to the cadres of the credit cooperatives in order to reduce or avoid possible deviations or errors in the work.

    做好收回到期农业贷款的工作
    周麒
    由于农业合作化运动的蓬勃展开和农业增产计划的逐年扩大，预计明年国家发放的农业贷款将要比今年增加一倍。这笔资金的来源，除继续由国家从财政中增拨一部外，其余要依靠今年秋、冬季收回到期农业贷款来周转解决。同时，在旺季收购季节，市场货币投放集中，这除了需要做好商品供应和吸收储蓄回笼货币外，及时收回到期农贷也是回笼货币、稳定市场的一个重要方面。
    今年全国普遍获得丰收，百分之八十左右的农业生产合作社都增了产，广大农民社会主义觉悟的不断提高，各地农村金融部门在收回到期农贷工作方面积累了一定的经验，这些都是今年做好收回农贷工作的有利条件。这就是说，只要加强对收贷工作的组织领导，收回到期农贷的任务就一定能够完成。
    但是目前收回到期农贷工作的进展情况是不能令人满意的，全国不少地区的收贷工作进展得很慢。这是什么原因呢？这主要是因为有些农村工作人员对收回到期农贷的意义认识不足，阻碍了这一工作的进展。他们认为发放贷款是扶持合作化、扶持生产，收回贷款就会对合作化对生产不利。因此，他们不但不去积极收回到期贷款，甚至还压抑了群众归还贷款的积极性。例如河南省安阳县宋村第三农业生产合作社原计划还款四百元，但驻社工作人员只准还二百元。陕西省富平县九区何草窖农业生产合作社已经计划提出一千一百五十斤小麦来归还贷款，驻社工作人员却不叫归还，叫留作社内开支。安徽省灵璧县冯庙区一个工作人员甚至威胁收回农贷的工作人员说：“收回农贷搞垮了合作社可要你负责。”这些工作人员的做法显然是错误的。动员合作社和农民及时归还到期贷款，它不但不会影响合作社的巩固和生产的发展，相反地，可以加强合作社在经营管理上的计划性，有利于合作社的巩固和生产的发展。还有一些工作人员认为今年是个丰收年，贷款不愁收不回。他们在这种盲目乐观情绪的支配下，放松了对收回农贷工作的组织领导，结果使收回农贷工作形成了放任自流。另一种值得注意的情况是，在收回农贷工作中，有些工作人员不敢向群众交代“能还的全还，能还一部的还一部，完全不能还的缓期”的政策，怕交代了政策就完不成收回农贷任务。他们根本不去调查研究借款户的情况和照顾群众还款的能力，为了追求收回农贷数字，甚至不讲究工作方式，以致在一些地区发生了“逼债”的现象，在群众中造成了十分恶劣的影响，给工作带来很大损害。
    为了做好收回到期农贷工作，各地必须在党组织的统一领导下结合中心工作，使收贷工作成为整个农村工作的一个组成部分。在收回农贷工作以前要端正和提高干部的思想认识，教育干部深入调查研究，摸清群众的偿还能力；同时要向群众进行归还贷款的宣传教育工作。要使借款农民懂得国家收回到期贷款是为明年发放更多的农业贷款筹集资金。当前农民在出售农产品以后，正是经济上最宽裕的时候，及时归还贷款，一方面可以有计划地安排自己用钱，免得钱在手头随便花费掉，另一方面及时归还贷款还可以少负担利息。对贷款户宣传政策要和当地实际情况结合起来，向群众说明，哪样的户应该全还，哪样的户可以暂还一部分，哪样的户可以缓期归还；对个别有能力还款而故意不还的贷款户，可以通过群众进行适当的批评教育。这样就能推动群众踊跃归还到期贷款，消除群众攀比观望情绪和等待减免的思想。江西省余干县在今年的收贷工作中，摸清了群众的实际偿还能力，全面地贯彻执行了政策，并向群众进行了深入的宣传教育，使群众懂得了及时归还到期贷款对国家对自己的好处，因而收回农贷工作进行十分顺利。这个县从八月五日到九月十二日的一个多月当中就完成了全年收回贷款计划的百分之七十五点七。
    到目前为止，各地农村的信用合作社已经发展到十五万三千多个，全国百分之八十以上的乡都建立了信用社；这是一支强大的农村金融力量。各地银行在收回农贷工作中必须很好地依靠这些信用社，这样做不但能够使收回农贷工作顺利进行，减少银行机构人员不足的困难，而且也能促进信用社业务的开展和社的巩固。但是目前由于新建立的信用社比重很大，干部政策水平较低，工作经验较少，因此，各地党委和银行一定要对信用社的干部加强检查、监督和具体帮助，以减少或避免工作中可能发生的偏差或错误。
