Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 1st.

Mr. Chairman:

The heads of government of the four powers have instructed the foreign ministers, with the help of experts, to study measures, including those that may be taken in the institutions and specialized organizations of the United Nations, that should be able to:

First, promote the gradual elimination of obstacles hindering the free movement and peaceful trade between peoples of all countries.

Second, promote freer contact and communication that are mutually beneficial to the countries and peoples concerned.

Our task is to continue the work that has made a good start, acting in a spirit of mutual understanding. In this way, we will help create the necessary atmosphere of mutual respect and trust.

In its resolution on the report by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Bulganin, on August 5, 1955, the Supreme Soviet of the USSR made the following assessment of the results of the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers: "Establishing broader political, economic, and cultural relations between countries with different social and political systems, based on respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, is in the interests of the peoples of all countries and can contribute to the consolidation of peace, friendship, and cooperation between countries."

The Soviet government is taking measures to develop such cooperation and good mutual relations.

Suggestions have already been made here to establish a committee of experts on the development of contacts between East and West.

The Soviet delegation believes that the establishment of such a committee is appropriate and proposes that it begin work immediately. In order to make the committee's work fruitful, it is necessary to exchange views on the issues it should study and to try to determine the direction of its work.

Naturally, I would like to note with satisfaction the fact that Mr. Pinay and Mr. Macmillan, who spoke before me, have emphasized the need to develop contacts between our countries and between East and West in general. This is in accordance with the instructions of the heads of government of the four powers. However, it is clear that these speeches contain certain reservations. If we face the facts, these reservations are by no means indisputable. For example, the statements made by Mr. Pinay and Mr. Macmillan about the reasons for the disruption of normal economic relations between Eastern and Western countries are like that. These facts are well known to everyone. However, I think our task is not to argue, much less to attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of any country, but to strive to achieve the necessary positive results in developing contacts between East and West in trade, culture, science, travel, and so on. In the future, we can specifically talk about the problems arising from the different social systems of our contemporary countries in developing contacts. However, I can assure the conference that the Soviet Union's position on this issue is based on defending the interests of the Soviet people—not the interests of some privileged social group—while defending peace and consolidating the interests of friendship between peoples of all countries.

We believe that contacts between East and West can only be successfully developed on the basis of the development of international economic relations, which is inconceivable without the development of normal international trade. It is quite obvious that the unimpeded development of trade is in the interests of the peoples of all countries. Every country should be able to sell what it can sell without hindrance and buy what it needs from other countries without any discrimination. Establishing equal and mutually beneficial trade relations between countries will promote the normalization of international trade.

However, there are still many difficulties and artificial obstacles in the way of the normal development of trade between countries. Many countries' discriminatory measures against the Soviet Union and some other countries are well known. For example, prohibitions on the export of many commodities, disruption of normal credit relations, and obstruction of the free navigation of merchant ships are among these measures.

Various prohibitions and restrictions in trade cause mistrust in international relations and damage traditional economic ties, which not only hinders the strengthening of international economic relations, but also hinders the strengthening of other international relations. Therefore, it must be recognized that all restrictions in international trade should be lifted to show sincerity in promoting the expansion of international economic cooperation and promoting the consolidation of trust between countries and the development of contacts and ties between peoples of all countries.

It should not be thought that only some countries are concerned about the unimpeded development of trade, while others are not. This matter concerns all countries, because the normal development of trade can lead to the establishment of stable economic ties between countries, help ensure sales markets, and is a realistic basis for realizing and developing contacts and friendly ties between peoples of all countries. Sometimes people say that there is no suitable basis for developing trade with the Soviet Union, or that it has no commodities available for developing trade with other countries. The fact that the Soviet Union's foreign trade volume with other countries has increased fourfold since the war shows how untrue this statement is.

Therefore, the Soviet delegation believes that the committee of experts should first study the issue of eliminating the existing discriminatory measures that hinder the development of economic relations between countries. Doing so is in accordance with the requirements in the first part of the instructions of the heads of government of the four powers regarding the development of contacts.

Under the current conditions of eased international tensions, it is particularly necessary to eliminate those barriers that hinder the normal development of international economic ties and to stipulate the application of the principle of most-favored-nation treatment in trade and navigation issues. The Soviet Union's starting point on this issue is that unimpeded international trade is one of the main factors in promoting cooperation between countries. If this trade is developed and prosperous, it will become an important driving force for maintaining and consolidating world peace.

Much work remains to be done in developing contacts in culture, science, and technology. Measures such as exchanging industrial and agricultural experience, sending more delegations of social figures and cultural figures to visit each other, and developing travel are all beneficial. This is in accordance with the requirements in the second part of the instructions of the heads of government of the four powers regarding the development of contacts.

Mr. Macmillan spoke of such issues as the so-called uniformity of Soviet public opinion. He also spoke of certain other problems in Soviet internal life. We are familiar with these kinds of attacks. We are not prepared to treat the internal order of Britain in the same way. But those who study our history and the history of our people will easily be convinced of how peace-loving our people are, who have taken such resolute measures to get rid of the Tsar's rule, and later to get rid of the oppression of the privileged propertied classes of old Russia. It is not difficult to believe that our entire social life and all the work of our government are permeated with concern for the welfare of the people, which enables them to obtain full freedom of development in the Soviet Union and in the Soviet people's relations with the people of other countries, in all aspects of political, economic, and cultural life.

The Soviet Union is making every effort to promote the development of contacts between the Soviet Union and other countries. Regarding this, we can cite enough examples to illustrate. For example, recently, parliamentary delegations from countries such as Britain, India, Sweden, Syria, Finland, Yugoslavia, Japan, France, Belgium, and Luxembourg visited our country at the invitation of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. These delegations obtained extensive possibilities to understand the life and peaceful labor of the Soviet people.

It can be seen that recently, cultural ties between the Soviet Union and many countries, including Britain, France, and the United States, have become active.

From August to October this year, more than 20 British delegations visited the Soviet Union. Among them were delegations of teachers, trade union workers, scientists, agricultural workers, doctors, athletes, and so on. During this period, delegations of Soviet light industry and chemical industry workers, construction workers, shipbuilding workers, and Soviet radio station workers, and so on, visited Britain from the Soviet Union.

Cultural ties between France and the Soviet Union have also expanded. The French Film Week and the performances of French athletes held in the Soviet Union aroused great interest among Soviet audiences. The performances of the Soviet art troupe in Paris were very successful. The number of French travelers visiting the Soviet Union has increased. Journalists from almost all major French newspapers have visited the Soviet Union. They were given the opportunity to extensively understand our country's life. The scope of exchanges of scientific and technological and business delegations between France and the Soviet Union is expanding. Delegations of French industrialists, dynamists, construction workers, teachers, scientific and cultural workers have visited the Soviet Union. Delegations of Soviet industrial workers, cultural and scientific workers have also visited France.

It can be pointed out that there have been some improvements in cultural ties between the Soviet Union and the United States. The two countries have mutually dispatched delegations of journalists. A Soviet agricultural delegation visited the United States, and an American agricultural Delegation also visited the Soviet Union. Now, the arrangement for mutually dispatching art delegations between the United States and the Soviet Union has begun.

Everyone sees that there have been preliminary achievements now. However, in order to ensure the even wider development of international exchanges that are mutually beneficial to all countries and peoples, more considerable efforts must be made.

As already said above, the task of specifically drafting measures on the development of contacts between East and West should be entrusted to a four-power expert committee. In this regard, it is hoped that the experts can best use the following tasks as guidelines in their work:

1. Draft recommendations specifying measures to promote international trade on mutually beneficial terms, keeping in mind the need to eliminate the obstacles and restrictions that currently exist in East-West trade, and apply the principle of most-favored-nation treatment in trade and navigation issues.

2. Stipulate that the four powers take measures within their capabilities to ensure that merchant ships of all countries can travel unimpeded in all international straits and canals. Eliminate the existing restrictions on maritime transport established for certain countries.

3. Formulate recommendations to expand scientific and technological links, including the exchange of achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy (technical, agricultural, and medical aspects), by convening meetings of relevant experts and other personnel. It would be best to convene a conference in 1956 to discuss the use of atomic energy in medicine as an immediate measure.

4. Formulate recommendations to expand and strengthen contacts between East and West in industry, agriculture, and education, to expand and strengthen cultural links, to develop tourism, to exchange delegations, and to exchange publications in science, technology, agriculture, literature, and art.

It would also be beneficial for countries to reach agreements on cooperation in broadcasting, that is, to use radio to develop cultural and scientific links and to strengthen mutual understanding between countries. It would also be best to organize the exchange of experience and achievements in the technical development of radio broadcasting and television.

The Soviet Union has been and is in favor of the wide development of contacts between East and West. It is willing to do everything possible to achieve positive results in this area, thereby promoting the further relaxation of international tensions.

The Soviet delegation has drafted a joint draft resolution on the development of contacts between East and West and submitted it to the conference for discussion.

In drafting this draft, the instructions of the heads of government of the four powers in Geneva were taken into account, and attention was also paid to the wishes expressed by many representatives of the Western business community, social activists, science, cultural workers, and representatives of sports organizations, as well as individuals, on the issue of developing contacts between East and West.

The Soviet delegation believes that the implementation of this work plan will lead to a deeper understanding and the strengthening of friendly ties between countries. This will promote the further relaxation of international tensions and is fully in line with the wishes of the peoples of all countries, which we all know.

For the reasons I have mentioned above, I ask the conference to discuss the recommendations drafted by the Soviet delegation on the development of contacts between East and West.

Development of Contacts Between East and West (Recommendation of the Soviet Delegation)

The instructions of the heads of government of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France on the issue of developing contacts between East and West pointed out that it is necessary to study "measures—including those that may be taken in the institutions and specialized organizations of the United Nations—that should be able to (a) promote the gradual elimination of obstacles hindering the free movement and peaceful trade between peoples of all countries; (b) promote freer contact and communication that are mutually beneficial to the countries and peoples concerned."

Based on this instruction, it is recommended that the foreign ministers of the four powers reach the following agreement in the spirit of promoting the consolidation of international peace and cooperation:

1. It is considered necessary to take measures to promote the development of international trade, to eliminate the existing obstacles and restrictions in East-West international trade, and to apply the principle of most-favored-nation treatment in trade and navigation issues.

2. The four powers shall take measures within their capabilities to promote the unimpeded passage of merchant ships of all countries in international straits and canals, and to eliminate the various restrictions currently imposed on certain countries in maritime transport.

3. Take measures to convene meetings of relevant experts and other personnel to expand international scientific and technological links, especially international links in the peaceful use of atomic energy (technical, agricultural, medical, etc.). The representatives of the four powers participating in international organizations for international scientific and technological cooperation will take corresponding measures. It is believed that the best immediate measure in this regard is to convene an international conference on the use of atomic energy in health care in 1956.

4. The four powers advocate that all countries willing to cooperate in specialized international organizations (International Labor Organization, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, World Health Organization, International Telecommunication Union, etc.) should be allowed to participate in these organizations.

5. The following measures will also be encouraged, including measures that the institutions and specialized organizations of the United Nations may take to strengthen industrial, agricultural, cultural links and develop travel contacts between East and West:

A. Mutually send delegations and industrial, agricultural, and trade personnel to visit each other to exchange experiences and familiarize themselves with the achievements of the respective countries in these areas.

B. Expand cultural links between countries in order to develop wider exchanges between scientific and cultural workers and exchange cultural treasures. It is believed that it is appropriate for countries to conclude corresponding cultural cooperation agreements;

C. Expand the exchange of printed publications (books, magazines, newspapers, etc.) between scientific research institutes, libraries, scientific and cultural associations, social organizations, and private individuals;

D. Take measures to more widely develop international travel and sports links between countries;

E. Take measures to eliminate the artificial obstacles that currently exist in immigration and other regulations that hinder the expansion of the above-mentioned contacts between countries.

### 在十月三十一日四国外交部长会议上  莫洛托夫关于发展东西方之间的接触问题的发言

专栏：

    在十月三十一日四国外交部长会议上
    莫洛托夫关于发展东西方之间的接触问题的发言主席先生：
    四国政府首脑曾经指示外交部长们在专家的帮助下研究一些措施，包括在联合国的机构和专门组织中可能采取的措施在内，这些措施应该能够：
    第一，促成逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间自由往来和和平贸易的障碍。
    第二，促成对有关国家和人民相互有利的更自由的接触和交往。
    我们的任务在于：根据互相谅解的精神行事，继续进行有了良好开端的工作。这样我们就会帮助创造必需的互相尊重和信任的气氛。
    苏联最高苏维埃在就苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁一九五五年八月五日的报告所作的决议中，对四国政府首脑日内瓦会议的结果作了这样的估价：“不同社会制度和政治制度的国家，在尊重主权和互不干涉内政的基础上建立更广泛的政治、经济和文化关系，是符合各国人民的利益的，并且能促使各国之间的和平、友谊和合作得到巩固。”
    苏联政府正在采取措施以发展这种合作和良好的相互关系。
    有人已经在这里提出建议，主张建立关于发展东西方之间的接触问题的专家委员会。
    苏联代表团认为建立这种委员会是适宜的，并且主张它立刻着手工作。为了使委员会的工作富有成果，必须就它应当研究的问题交换意见，并且设法确定它的工作方向。
    自然，我要满意地指出这一事实：在我之前发言的比内先生和麦克米伦先生已经强调必须发展我们这些国家之间和一般东西方国家之间的接触。这是符合四国政府首脑的指示的。但是，有一点很明显，这些发言带有某种保留。如果正视事实的话，这些保留决不是不容争辩的。譬如，应该说比内先生和麦克米伦先生关于东西方国家之间的正常经济关系遭到破坏的原因的说法就是这样的。这些事实是大家都很清楚的。但是，我想，我们的任务不是争论，更不是企图干涉某个国家的内政，而是力求在发展东西方之间在贸易、文化、科学、旅行等等的接触方面获得必要的积极结果。今后我们还可以具体地谈谈在发展接触方面由于我们当代各国社会制度不同而产生的问题。但是，我可以向会议保证，苏联在这个问题上的立场是建立在捍卫苏联人民的利益——而不是某种具有特权的社会集团的利益——，同时捍卫和平和各国人民间的友好关系的利益的巩固基础上的。
    我们认为，东西方的接触只有在国际经济关系发展的基础上才能得到顺利的发展，而如果没有正常的国际贸易的发展，这是不能设想的。十分明显：无阻碍地发展贸易是符合各国人民的利益的。每一个国家都应该不受阻碍地出售自己所能出售的东西，不受任何歧视地向其他国家购买自己所需要的东西。建立国与国之间平等和互利的贸易关系将会促进国际贸易的正常化。
    但是，在正常地发展国与国之间的贸易的道路上还存在着不少困难和人为的障碍。许多国家对苏联和某些其他国家采取的一些歧视措施是人所共知的。例如：禁止许多商品的出口、破坏通常的信贷关系、阻碍商船的自由航行等等就属于这些措施之列。
    在贸易方面的种种禁止和限制引起国际关系中的不信任，损害了传统的经济联系，这不仅阻碍着国际经济关系的加强，而且还阻碍着国际其他关系的加强。因此，必须承认应当取消国际贸易中的种种限制，这样来表示有诚意促进扩大国际经济合作以及促进巩固国与国之间的信任和发展各国人民的接触和联系。
    不应当认为，只有某些国家关心毫无阻碍地发展贸易，而另外一些国家是不关心的。这件事是所有的国家都关心的，因为贸易的正常发展能导致各国间稳固的经济联系的建立，有助于保证销售市场，并且是实现和发展各国人民之间的接触和友好联系的现实基础。有时有人说，没有适当的基础发展同苏联的贸易，或者说它没有可供同其他国家发展贸易的商品。从下面这点就可以看出这种说法是多么不符合事实：苏联同其他国家之间的对外贸易额在战后已经增加到战前的四倍了。
    因此，苏联代表团认为，专家委员会首先应当研究消除现有的那些阻碍着各国间经济关系发展的歧视措施的问题。这样做是符合四国政府首脑指示中关于发展接触的第一部分提出的要求的。
    在现在国际紧张局势已经有了缓和的条件下，特别需要消除那些阻碍着国际经济联系正常发展的壁障，并且规定在贸易和航海的问题上应用最惠国待遇的原则。苏联在这个问题上的出发点是：无阻碍的国际贸易是各国间实行合作的主要因素之一。这种贸易如果得到发展和繁荣，就会成为维护和巩固世界和平的一个重要动力。
    在发展文化、科学、技术各方面的接触这件事上，还得做许多工作。交换工业和农业经验的措施，更多地互派社会人士和文化人士的代表团访问，发展旅行往来，这些都是有好处的。这是符合四国政府首脑指示中关于发展接触的第二部分的要求的。
    麦克米伦先生曾经谈到诸如苏联舆论的某种划
  一的问题。他还谈到了苏联内部生活中的某些其他问题。这类的攻击我们是熟悉的。我们不准备以同样的态度来对待英国的内部秩序。但是那些研究我国历史和我国人民的历史的人会很容易地信服：曾经采取这样坚决的措施来摆脱沙皇的统治，而后来又摆脱了旧俄的特权有产阶级的压迫的我国人民，是多么爱好和平。还不难相信：我国整个的社会生活，我国政府的全部工作，是如何地贯穿着对人民福利的关怀，这种关怀使得他们在苏联国内以及苏联人民同其他国家的人民的关系中，在政治、经济和文化生活的各方面，能够得到充分的发展自由。
    苏联在尽一切努力促进苏联和其他国家的接触的发展。关于这一点，我们可以举出足够多的例子来说明。譬如，最近就有英国、印度、瑞典、叙利亚、芬兰、南斯拉夫、日本、法国、比利时、卢森堡这样一些国家的议会代表团应苏联最高苏维埃的邀请，访问了我国。这些代表团获得了了解苏联人民的生活和和平劳动的广泛的可能性。
    可以看出，最近苏联同许多国家，其中包括英国、法国和美国的文化联系活跃起来了。
    今年八月到十月，英国有二十多个代表团访问了苏联。其中有教师、工会工作者、科学家、农业工作者、医师、运动员等等代表团。在这个期间内，从苏联到英国访问的有苏联轻工业和化学工业工作者、建筑工作者、造船业工作者和苏联广播电台工作者等等。
    法国和苏联的文化联系也扩大了。在苏联举行的法国电影周和法国运动员的表演，引起了苏联观众的极大兴趣、苏联艺术团在巴黎的演出非常成功。访问苏联的法国旅行者增加了。几乎所有的法国主要报纸的记者都访问了苏联。他们得到了机会广泛了解我国的生活。法国和苏联交换科学技术界和商界代表团的范围正在扩大中。法国工业家、动力学家、建筑工作者、教师、科学文化工作者的代表团访问了苏联。苏联工业工作者、文化和科学工作者的代表团也访问了法国。
    可以指出，苏联和美国的文化联系方面已经有了某些好转。两国已经互相派遣了新闻工作者代表团。苏联农业代表团访问了美国，美国农业代表团也访问了苏联。现在，美国和苏联两国之间已经开始安排互派艺术代表团的事宜。
    大家看到，现在已经有初步成就。但是，为了保证对各国和各国人民互相有利的国际交往获得更加广泛的发展，还得作不小努力。
    上面已经说过，具体草拟关于发展东西方之间的接触的措施的工作，应当委托四国专家委员会来做。在这方面，希望专家们在工作中最好能够以下列各项任务为指针：
    一、草拟一些建议，规定关于促进在互利条件下进行国际贸易的措施，记住要消除东西方贸易方面目前所存在的障碍和限制，并且在贸易和航海问题上应用最惠国待遇原则。
    二、规定四国采取在其能力范围内的措施，使一切国家的商船能够在一切国际性的海峡和运河中畅行无阻。消除现有的在海运方面对某些国家设立的限制。
    三、拟定一些建议，规定扩大科学技术联系，其中包括交流和平利用原子能方面（技术、农业和医学等方面）的成就，交流的方法是召开有有关的专家和其他人员参加的会议。最好在一九五六年召开一次讨论在医学方面利用原子能的会议，作为立即采取的措施。
    四、拟定一些建议，规定扩大和加强东西方之间在工业、农业、教育各方面的接触，扩大和加强文化联系，发展旅行业，互派代表团，交换科学、技术、农业、文艺各方面的出版物。
    各国之间就广播事业方面的合作达成协议，即利用无线电发展文化和科学联系以及加强国与国之间的互相了解，这也是有益的。最好还能够在无线电广播和电视的技术发展方面组织经验和成就的交流。
    苏联在过去和现在都是拥护广泛发展东西方之间的接触的。它愿意竭尽一切可能，以求得在这方面取得积极的结果，从而促成国际紧张局势的进一步缓和。
    苏联代表团方面已经拟定了一项关于发展东西方之间的接触问题的共同决议草案，并且把它提交会议讨论。
    在草拟这个草案的过程中，考虑到日内瓦四国政府首脑会议上的指示，同时也注意到西方国家贸易界的许多代表、社会活动家、科学、文化工作者和体育团体的代表以及个人对发展东西方之间的接触问题所表示的愿望。
    苏联代表团相信，这个工作计划的实现将导致互相了解的加深和国与国之间的友好联系的加强。这会促成国际紧张局势的进一步缓和，而且是完全符合我们大家都知道的各国人民的愿望的。
    根据上面我所讲到的理由，我请会议讨论苏联代表团所草拟的关于发展东西方之间的接触的建议。
    发展东西方之间的接触（苏联代表团的建议）
    苏、美、英、法四国政府首脑对发展东西方之间的接触的问题上的指示指出，必须研究“措施——包括在联合国的机构和专门机构中可能采取的措施在内，这些措施应当能够（甲）促成逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间的自由往来和和平贸易的障碍；（乙）促成对有关国家和人民相互有利的更自由的接触和交流。”
    根据这个指示，建议四国外交部长本着促进巩固国际和平合作的愿望达成下列协议：
    一、认为必须采取促进国际贸易发展的措施，消除在东西方国际贸易方面现存的障碍和限制，在贸易和航海问题方面应用最惠国待遇的原则。
    二、四国采取它们能力范围内的措施，来促使各国商船可以在国际性的海峡和运河中畅行无阻，并且消除目前在海运方面对某些国家实行的种种限制。
    三、采取措施，召开有有关专家和其他人员参加的会议，以扩大国际科学技术联系，特别是在和平利用原子能方面（技术、农业、医学等方面）的国际联系。参加国际科学技术合作国际组织的四国代表将采取相应的措施。认为这方面的立即措施最好是在一九五六年召开关于在保健事业方面利用原子能的国际会议。
    四、四国主张凡是愿意在专门性的国际组织
  （国际劳工组织，联合国教育、科学及文化组织，世界卫生组织和国际电讯联盟等）中合作的国家一律可以参加这些组织。
    五、下列措施也将得到鼓励，包括联合国组织的机构和专门机构在加强东西方之间在工业、农业、文化联系和发展旅行的接触方面可能采取的措施在内：
    甲、互派代表团和工业、农业及贸易工作人员互相访问，以交流经验和熟悉相应国家在这些方面的成就。
    乙、扩大国与国之间的文化联系以便发展科学和文化工作者之间更加广泛的往来和交换文化珍品，认为国与国之间缔结相应的文化合作协定是适宜的；
    丙、科学研究所、图书馆、科学和文化协会、社会团体和私人之间互相扩大交换印刷出版物（书籍、杂志和报纸等）；
    丁、采取更加广泛地发展国际旅行以及国与国之间的体育联系的措施；
    戊、采取措施消除目前在移民和其他条例方面存在的阻碍扩大国与国之间的上述接触的人为障碍。　（新华社据塔斯社日内瓦一日电）
