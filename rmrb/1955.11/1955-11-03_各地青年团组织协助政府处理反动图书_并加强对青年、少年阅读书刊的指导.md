    Youth League Organizations in Various Localities Assist the Government in Handling Reactionary Books and Strengthen Guidance on Reading Materials for Youth and Children

    Youth League organizations in many cities across the country are actively assisting the government in handling reactionary, obscene, and absurd books, and are strengthening guidance on the reading of books by youth and children.

    Youth League organizations in Jiangsu and Shanxi provinces investigated the extent to which youth and children were harmed by reactionary books and paintings, and issued working opinions and notices to organizations at all levels regarding assisting the government in handling reactionary, obscene, and absurd books and pictures. They required Youth League cadres to conscientiously carry out propaganda and mobilization work, and vigorously recommend educational books suitable for youth and children to read. Youth League organizations in Liaoning, Xi'an, and other places have transferred cadres to participate in the government's work of handling reactionary, obscene, and absurd books. Youth League organizations in Tianjin, Fushun, Lushun-Dalian, Kunming, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, and other places have all conducted investigations into the harmful effects of local old book stalls, bookstores, and bad publications on youth and children.

    Many local Youth League organizations have used various forces and diverse methods to educate youth and children to read good books and not to read bad books. The Qiqihar Youth League organization helped relevant departments establish youth and children's reading rooms in the city library, added books to the cultural center, and experimentally built two mobile book stalls in the area with the most renting and selling of bad publications in the past. The Qiqihar City Federation of Trade Unions also donated 10,000 copies of books on the cultivation of youth's morality to the libraries of various factories. The Changshu City Youth League organization, in coordination with the city's Culture Section, Xinhua Bookstore, and library, held an "Exhibition of Excellent Reading Materials for Youth." Many places have also held reading report meetings, seminars, etc., to guide young people in reading progressive books and periodicals. The Changchun City Youth League organization held 53 "Seagull" novel report meetings. The Anshan City Youth League organization established 146 reading groups throughout the city and assisted the trade union in renting books to dormitories and workshops. The Yangzhou City Youth League organization actively organizes various amateur cultural activities to help young people spend their Sundays well.

    Some units, through discussing typical cases of how being poisoned by bad books and periodicals affects work, study, health, and even leads to corruption and degeneration, and by adopting individual assistance methods, educate young people not to read bad books, with good results. In one class at Dalian No. 4 Middle School, 80% of the students had been harmed by bad books in the past. With the patient help of parents and teachers, and after discussing typical cases, a new atmosphere of not reading bad books was created. Many students automatically stopped reading bad books, their academic performance also improved significantly, and the number of people borrowing books from the library doubled.

    各地青年团组织协助政府处理反动图书
    并加强对青年、少年阅读书刊的指导
    全国不少城市的青年团组织积极协助政府处理反动、淫秽、荒诞的图书，并加强对青年、少年阅读书籍的指导。
    江苏、山西省的青年团组织调查了青年、少年受反动书画毒害的情况，并向各级组织发出关于协助政府处理反动、淫秽、荒诞书刊图画的工作意见和通知，要求团的干部认真做好宣传动员工作，大力推荐适宜于青年、少年阅读的有教育意义的书籍。辽宁、西安等地的青年团组织抽调干部参加政府处理反动、淫秽、荒诞图书的工作。天津、抚顺、旅大、昆明、杭州、扬州等地的青年团组织都先后对本地旧书摊、书铺和坏书刊对青年、少年的毒害等情况进行了调查。
    许多地方的青年团组织运用各方面的力量和多种多样的方式，教育青年、少年读好书，不要读坏书。齐齐哈尔市的青年团组织帮助有关部门在市图书馆建立了青年、少年阅览室，文化馆增添了图书，在过去租售坏书刊最多的地方试建了两个流动图书摊，齐齐哈尔市工会并赠给各工厂图书馆有关青年品德修养的书籍一万册。常熟市的青年团组织配合市文化科、新华书店、图书馆举办了“青年优秀读物展览会”。不少地方还举办了读书报告会、座谈会等，指导青年阅读进步书刊。长春市的青年团组织举办“海鸥”小说报告会有五十三次。鞍山市的青年团组织在全市建立了一百四十六个读书小组，并协助工会到宿舍、车间租借图书。扬州市的青年团组织积极组织各种业余文化活动，使青年过好星期天。
    有些单位通过讨论受坏书刊毒害而影响工作、学习、健康以至腐化堕落的典型事例，和采取个别帮助的方式，教育青年不看坏书，效果良好。大连第四中学有个别班级，过去百分之八十的学生都受过坏书的毒害，在家长、教师耐心帮助下，经过对典型事例的讨论，造成了不看坏书的新风气，许多学生自动停止看坏书，学习成绩也有了显著的提高，向图书馆借书的增加了一倍。（新华社）
