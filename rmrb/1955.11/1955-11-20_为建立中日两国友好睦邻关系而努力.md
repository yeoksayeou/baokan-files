As a result of the exchange of views between Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and Tetsuji Katayama, head of the Japanese "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution" delegation to China and chairman of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution, the Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution issued a joint communiqué on the 16th. This is of great significance for promoting the normalization of relations between China and Japan and ensuring peace and security in the Far East.

The joint communiqué announced that both parties agreed that countries should coexist peacefully and should resolve their disputes and outstanding issues through peaceful consultations, rather than resorting to force. All issues between China and Japan should also be resolved in accordance with this principle. The People's Republic of China respects the Japanese people's peaceful desire to declare a permanent renunciation of war. The people of China and Japan are willing to guarantee mutual respect for national sovereignty, non-aggression, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, in order to safeguard peace and security in the Far East.

The joint communiqué pointed out that the people of China and Japan should establish long-term friendly and good-neighborly relations in a new environment and on a new basis, and should first work together to promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan. The communiqué also pointed out that the Japanese people's movement to oppose rearmament and uphold the peaceful constitution, for the sake of peace, is very beneficial to promoting the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan and enhancing the friendly relations between the two peoples.

At the same time, the joint communiqué confirmed that relations between China and Japan should be adjusted in accordance with the principles of peaceful coexistence, expressed a common desire to work for the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and gave strong support to the Japanese people's movement against rearmament and in support of the peaceful constitution. The joint communiqué reflects the common aspirations of the vast majority of Japanese people and will undoubtedly encourage the Japanese people to strengthen their efforts to strive for peace, independence, autonomy, and the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan.

The Chinese people deeply understand the current situation of the Japanese people, and sympathize with and support their efforts to oppose rearmament and promote the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan, China, and the Soviet Union. As the joint communiqué pointed out, China and Japan have had a long history of peaceful coexistence for two thousand years. Although this friendly relationship has been damaged by the aggression of Japanese militarism, this is already a thing of the past. All promising nations should focus their eyes on a future full of hope, rather than dwelling on an unpleasant past. The efforts made by the people of China and Japan to restore friendly relations between the two countries show that these two great nations have full confidence in their own future.

Today, the people of China and Japan have ample conditions to establish long-term friendly and good-neighborly relations in a new environment and on a new basis. Since the end of World War II, Japan has been under the occupation of U.S. imperialism, which has fundamentally changed Japan's current position compared with the past, and thus fundamentally changed the feelings of the Chinese people towards the Japanese people. The Japanese people's struggle for independence and peace has now become an important part of the Asian people's broad struggle for independence and peace. Every victory that the Japanese people achieve in their struggle for independence and autonomous rights is conducive to the cause of Asian people's striving for independence and defending peace. The Chinese people are now also working to achieve complete independence and peace in the Far East. China's territory, Taiwan, is still under U.S. occupation. The Chinese people are also subject to U.S. war threats. This shared experience of the people of China and Japan being subjected to aggression from the same side cannot but make them care for each other, and support and sympathize with each other in their efforts for the same goal.

China and Japan have a long history of economic and cultural exchanges. In today's new environment, economic and cultural relations between China and Japan have ample prospects for development. The common economic and cultural prosperity and development of China and Japan will undoubtedly greatly benefit the efforts of the two peoples to strive for independence and defend peace.

Therefore, there is no reason for China and Japan not to restore normal relations under the guidance of the principles of peaceful coexistence, so as to help each other, exchange what each has for what the other needs, and join hands in the big family of Asian countries to work together to ensure peace and security in Asia. This not only conforms to the interests of the people of China and Japan, but also conforms to the interests of the people of Asia. The joint communiqué issued by the Secretary-General of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the Secretary-General of the Japanese National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution shows that this is the common aspiration of the people of China and Japan.

However, there are still many obstacles on the road to the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan. In order to realize the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations, the people of China and Japan and the Chinese government have made and are still making efforts in many ways. But this effort has been strongly obstructed by the United States and those in the Japanese government who succumb to American policy. These people cannot see the earth-shaking changes taking place in Asia, regard the interests of the U.S. "Cold War" as higher than the interests of the entire Japanese nation, attempt to rearm with the support of the United States, put Japan on the U.S. war chariot, and thus drive the Japanese people to the edge of the abyss of war once again. They ignore the Chinese government's repeated efforts to restore normal relations between China and Japan, but instead create all kinds of unwarranted problems to obstruct them. They also deliberately mistreat overseas Chinese in Japan, and even violate their will and use force to send them to Taiwan, attempting to use this to stimulate the feelings of the Chinese people. These people are obviously afraid of the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations.

Therefore, the Japanese people still face enormous difficulties. But the hardworking and brave Japanese people have the power to overcome these difficulties. The Japanese people, who have a long tradition of independence and a high degree of national self-esteem, will not tolerate the current situation for long. In fact, despite the obstruction of the reactionary forces of the United States and Japan, the Japanese people's efforts to oppose rearmament and strive for the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations have achieved certain results. The Japanese people's struggle against military bases and against atomic weapons has struck at the U.S. conspiracy to turn Japan into an atomic base and has won the sympathy and support of the people of all countries in the world. The increasing frequency of exchanges between trade, culture, art, and scientific groups between China and Japan recently is also the result of the efforts of the vast majority of the Japanese people. This shows that as long as the Japanese people continue to work hard, the day when Japan's independence and autonomy and the normalization of relations between China and Japan will surely arrive. This is the will of the Japanese people, and the will of the people cannot be stopped by any force.

The Chinese people sincerely hope that the Japanese "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution" delegation will bring the friendship and goodwill of the Chinese people to the Japanese people after visiting various parts of China. The Chinese people will do their best to establish a long-term friendly and good-neighborly relationship between the two peoples.

### 为建立中日两国友好睦邻关系而努力

　　为建立中日两国友好睦邻关系而努力
    我国总理周恩来和日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团长、日本拥护宪法国民联合会主席片山哲交换意见的结果，中国人民外交学会秘书长和日本拥护宪法国民联合会秘书长在十六日发表了联合公报。这对于促进中日两国关系正常化和保障远东的和平和安全，都有着重大的意义。
    联合公报宣布：双方一致认为，国家和国家之间应该和平相处，并且应该用和平协商的方法解决彼此之间的争端和悬案，而不应该诉诸武力。中日两国之间存在的一切问题也应该本着这个原则来求得解决。中华人民共和国尊重日本人民宣布永久放弃战争手段的和平愿望。中日两国人民愿意保证互相尊重国家主权，互不侵犯和互不干涉内政，以有利于保障远东的和平和安全。
    联合公报指出，中日两国人民应该在新的环境和基础上建立长远的友好睦邻关系，并且首先应该为促进中日两国邦交的恢复而共同努力。公报也指出，日本人民为争取和平而进行的反对重整军备的运动和拥护和平宪法的运动，对促进中日两国恢复邦交和增进两国人民的友好关系是非常有利的。
    同时，联合公报确认了应该根据和平相处的原则调整中日两国之间的关系，表示了为促进恢复中日两国邦交而努力的共同愿望，对日本人民反对重整军备、拥护和平宪法的运动给了有力的支持。联合公报反映着广大日本人民的共同愿望，并无疑地将鼓舞日本人民加强争取和平、独立自主和恢复中日正常关系的努力。
    中国人民深切地理解日本人民目前的处境，并且同情和支持他们为反对重整军备、促进恢复日中、日苏邦交而进行的努力。正如联合公报所指出的，中日两国两千年来有过长期和平共处的历史。虽然这种友好关系曾经由于日本军国主义的侵略而遭到损害，但是这已经是过去了的事情。一切有前途的民族都应当把自己的眼光放在充满着希望的未来，而不是念念不忘于不愉快的过去。中日两国人民为恢复两国友好关系而作的努力，说明这两个伟大的民族对于自己前途都具有着充分的信心。
    今天，中日两国人民有着充分的条件在新的环境和基础上建立长远的友好睦邻关系。在第二次世界大战结束以后，日本一直在美帝国主义的占领之下，这使日本现在的地位同过去相比，已经有了根本的变化，从而使得中国人民对于日本人民的感情也发生了根本的变化。现在日本人民争取独立和和平的斗争，已经成为亚洲人民争取独立和和平的广泛斗争中的重要的一部分。日本人民在争取独立和自主权利的斗争中取得的每一分胜利，都有利于亚洲人民争取独立、保卫和平的事业。中国人民现在也在为争取完全独立和远东和平而努力。中国的领土台湾现在还在美国的侵占之下。中国人民也受到美国的战争威胁。中日两国人民这种受到来自同一方面的侵略的同样遭遇，不能不使它们相互关切，并在为了同样目的而进行的努力中相互支持和同情。
    中日两国在经济上和文化上有着悠久的交往。在今天新的环境下，中日两国之间的经济上和文化上的关系有着充分发展的前途。中日两国经济上和文化上的共同繁荣和发展，无疑将大大有利两国人民争取独立、保卫和平的努力。
    因此，中日两国没有任何理由不在和平相处的原则的指导之下恢复正常关系，以便互相帮助，互通有无，在亚洲国家大家庭中携起手来，一起为保障亚洲的和平和安全而努力。这不仅符合于中日两国人民的利益，而且也符合于亚洲人民的利益。中国人民外交学会秘书长和日本拥护宪法国民联合会秘书长所发表的联合公报表明，这正是中日两国人民的共同愿望。
    但是在走向中日两国恢复正常关系的道路上至今仍障碍重重。为了实现中日关系正常化，中日两国人民和中国政府已经作了并且还在作着多方面的努力。但是这种努力却遭到了美国及日本政府中那些屈从美国政策的人们的竭力阻挠。这些人看不见在亚洲发生的惊天动地的变革，把美国的“冷战”利益看得高于日本的全民族利益，企图在美国的支持之下重整军备，把日本套上美国的战车，从而把日本人民又一次驱赶到战争深渊的边上。他们对于中国政府为了恢复中日正常关系的一再努力置之不理，反而制造出种种莫须有的问题来进行阻挠。他们还故意虐待在日本的华侨，甚至违反着他们的意志，用武力把他们送到台湾去，企图借此刺激中国人民的感情。这些人显然是害怕中日关系正常化的。
    因此，在日本人民面前还有着巨大的困难。但是勤劳而勇敢的日本人民是有力量克服这些困难的。有着长期独立传统和高度民族自尊心的日本人民，不会容忍目前的情况长久存在下去。事实上，尽管有着美日反动势力的阻挠，日本人民反对重整军备、争取中日关系正常化的努力已经取得了一定的成绩。日本人民反对军事基地、反对原子武器的斗争打击了美国把日本变为原子基地的阴谋，获得了世界各国人民的同情和支持。最近中日两国之间贸易、文化、艺术、科学团体的往来日益频繁，也是日本广大人民努力的结果。这就说明了：只要日本人民继续努力，日本的独立自主和中日两国关系正常化的一天必然要到来。这是日本人民的意志，而人民的意志是任何势力都阻挡不住的。
    中国人民衷心地希望，日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团在访问中国各地以后，将把中国人民的友好和善意带给日本人民。中国人民将尽自己最大的力量，为建立两国人民之间的长远的友好睦邻关系而努力。
