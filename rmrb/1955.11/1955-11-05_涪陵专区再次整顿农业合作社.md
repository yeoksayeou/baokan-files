    Fuling Prefecture Again Rectifies Agricultural Cooperatives

    Fuling Prefecture, Sichuan Province, is once again earnestly rectifying the existing agricultural producers' cooperatives.

    The 1,930 agricultural producers' cooperatives established in Fuling Prefecture before the spring plowing this year were all consolidated after the spring rectification, and a bumper harvest was generally achieved in both the large and small spring harvests. According to trial calculations of the distribution of 1,545 cooperatives, 95.14 percent of the cooperatives increased production to varying degrees. However, some cooperatives still have many outstanding issues that have not been resolved. Therefore, in early October, the second cooperative rectification work of this year began throughout the region. At present, all localities are proceeding from the current production situation, and are conducting rectification conscientiously, focusing on different situations and problems. Changshou and Fuling counties, where the work is progressing faster, have generally completed the distribution work and are summarizing the annual production, tapping the potential for increased production, and formulating production plans. The entire region will be fully rectified by mid-November. By then, the existing agricultural cooperatives will be universally improved. At the same time, 506 better cooperatives will, in conjunction with the rectification, complete the task of expanding membership by more than 4,360 households. (Luo Shuhua)

    涪陵专区再次整顿农业合作社
    四川省涪陵专区再次认真整顿现有的农业生产合作社。
    涪陵专区今年春耕以前建成的一千九百三十个农业生产合作社，经过春季整顿后，已全部巩固下来，大小春普遍获得了丰收。据一千五百四十五个社的分配试算，有百分之九十五点一四的社都不同程度的增产。但是有些社还有很多遗留问题没有处理，因此在十月上旬，在全区范围内又开始了今年第二次整社工作。目前各地正在从当前生产出发，针对不同的情况和问题，认真进行整顿。工作较快的长寿、涪陵两县一般已做好分配工作，正在总结全年生产、挖掘增产潜力、制定生产计划。全区至十一月中旬，就可全面整顿结束，到时，现有的农业合作社都将普遍提高一步，同时，有五百零六个较好的社，将结合整顿，完成扩大社员四千三百六十多户的任务。　（罗树华）
