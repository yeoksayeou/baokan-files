Xinhua Bookstore Plans Large-Scale Distribution of Books on Agricultural Cooperativization

The two documents, Chairman Mao's "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" passed by the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as books popularizing and explaining the principles and policies of agricultural cooperativization, are being published in large quantities. In order to distribute these documents and books to cities and rural areas in a timely, widespread, and in-depth manner, making them known to every household, and to effectively coordinate with the new high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the Xinhua Bookstore General Store has formulated a "Plan on Mobilizing the Entire Store to Do a Good Job in Distributing Books on Agricultural Cooperativization," and listed it as the overriding central task from now until the Spring Festival.

According to this plan, 20 million copies of Mao Zedong's work "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" are to be distributed; 15 million copies of the "Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" are to be distributed, and it must be ensured that: they are widely distributed among urban organs, organizations, schools, factories, and citizens; in rural areas, county, district, and township workers (including primary and secondary school teachers) who are likely to read them should basically have one copy per person; at least one copy should be supplied to each village, each agricultural production cooperative, rural club, and rural library; in addition, the needs of mutual aid teams must be actively met.

　　新华书店订出计划大量发行农业合作化书籍
    毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”和中共中央七届六中全会（扩大）通过的“关于农业合作化问题的决议”两个文件，以及通俗地宣传解释关于农业合作化方针政策的书籍，正大量出版。为了把这些文件和书籍及时广泛深入地发行到城市和农村，做到家喻户晓，以有力地配合农业合作化的新高潮，新华书店总店制定了“关于动员全店做好宣传农业合作化书籍发行工作计划”，并列为从现在起到春节期间的压倒一切的中心任务。
    根据这个计划，毛泽东的著“关于农业合作化问题”要发行到二千万册；“中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议”要发行到一千五百万册，并要做到：在城市机关、团体、学校、工厂、市民中广泛发行，在农村县、区、乡工作人员（包括中、小学教员）凡可能阅读的人，基本上人手一册，对每个村、每个农业生产合作社、农村俱乐部、农村图书室至少供应一本，此外还须积极满足互助组的需要。　（立人）
