Tractor Factory Workers Prepare for Winter Construction

The workers of the Construction Engineering Bureau, which is undertaking the construction of the tractor manufacturing plant, have determined their winter construction plan and measures to ensure the quality of the project and save on construction costs during this severe cold season. This year, the majority of the earthwork and concrete pouring for the factory buildings—the forging workshop, the repair and casting workshop, the auxiliary workshop, and the main warehouse—will be completed before the freezing period. This will avoid the risk of frozen concrete and ensure the solidity of the factory foundations; at the same time, it will save a significant amount on heating costs. Detailed regulations have also been made for insulation for those projects that must be carried out in winter. For the earthwork projects that are not completed each day, the surface soil will be loosened to prevent it from freezing overnight, which would hinder the progress of digging the next day. After the trenches are dug, they will be tightly covered with straw mats. The concrete foundations will use the heat storage method and be covered with movable mat sheds. For bricklaying projects, the simple freezing method will still be used. Boilers will be added to the mixing plant to mix the concrete with hot water, and the dump trucks transporting the concrete will also be equipped with insulation equipment. In addition, they have also formulated winter construction operating procedures for the use of construction machinery to ensure accurate construction results and construction safety.

　  拖拉机厂职工准备冬季施工
    承建拖拉机制造厂建筑工程局的职工，为了保证今年严寒季节中的工程质量和节约工程费用，目前已确定了冬季施工的方案和措施：今年年内的厂房工程——锻工场、修铸工场、辅助工场、总库房的大部土方和混凝土浇注工程，都提前在冰冻时期以前完成。这样，可以避免混凝土冻坯的危险，从而保证厂房基础的坚固；同时还可以省一大笔保暖费用。对于那些必须在冬季施工中的项目，在保温方面也作了详细的规定。每天未完成的土方工程，将浮皮土抓松，以防次日冻结了不好下铲，耽误挖土的进度；地槽挖好后，用草席盖严；混凝土基础采用蓄热法，上盖活动式的席棚；砌砖工程，仍采用简便冻结法。搅拌厂添置锅炉，用热水搅拌混凝土，运混凝土的自动翻斗汽车上也安装保温设备。此外，他们还对于使用施工机械方面，分别订出了冬季施工的操作规程，以保证准确的施工效果和施工的安全。
