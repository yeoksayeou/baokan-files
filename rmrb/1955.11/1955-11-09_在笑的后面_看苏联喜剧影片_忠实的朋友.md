    "True Friends" is a delightful and lyrical comedy, filled with laughter. Laughter is the characteristic of a comedy, but not the purpose of a comedy itself. A true comedy always hides something serious and worthy of deep thought behind the laughter. If the comedy of the old era truthfully reflected reality, such as Gogol's works, which contained "laughter through tears," with anger behind the laughter, a negation of the entire aristocratic bourgeois system, and using satire of the ugliness of reality to guide people to pursue ideals; then, the comedy "True Friends," which reflects the socialist society, gives us joy and encouragement. Although it satirizes the negative phenomena of society, it affirms the social system itself, strengthening people's confidence in moving forward. This is a new type of comedy of the Soviet era.
    "True Friends" ruthlessly lashes out at corrupt bureaucratic habits, spiritual stagnation, and decadence on the one hand; on the other hand, it also showcases all the beautiful and noble qualities of the Soviet people with infinite poetry, demonstrating their moral and political unity. Bureaucracy here is in a state of "besieged on all sides." This contradiction between the positive environment and the backward phenomena that run counter to it constitutes the foundation of the comedic conflict.
    All of this is expressed in the film through clever artistic techniques, through the laughable side of the characters' personalities, through the conflicts between the characters' personalities, and the laughable side of their interrelationships.
    The film depicts an unusual holiday trip of three friends drifting down the river on a raft. During this trip, this short slice of life, the filmmakers allowed us to see everything in the characters of the three friends, allowed us to see the entire Soviet society, and saw the countless laughs sparked by the conflict of different characters, by the rejection of backward phenomena by the entire society, and the significance behind the laughter. This laughter helped Nesteratov get rid of old ideas and also educated the audience.
    The three mischievous little devils in a small dilapidated boat on the Yauza River near Moscow grew into three respectable scholars and experts, many years passed in between. But what does it matter? Doesn't the film show the most essential and characteristic spiritual outlook of the three friends through this trip? Two friends traveled around many construction sites to find Nesteratov, only to find that he hadn't left his office; the stubborn girl Kaga, who came from the Osokin construction site, waited for a week but finally failed to see Nesteratov, and had to angrily protest; the tone and demeanor of Nesteratov's repeated instructions to sit in first class when the three friends set off on their journey, his complaints and embarrassment during the stormy night on the raft... From these plots, can't we recognize the spirit of that captain who liked to "show off" on the small dilapidated boat back then, and now became an academician of the Academy of Architecture? Standing before us is a proud, aloof man who has lost his passion for life. Although the film does not depict his past experiences and life, we clearly know: it was the Soviet regime, the people, who cultivated him, giving him the possibility to develop his talents and making him a respectable scholar. But he, Nesteratov, as his academic achievements grew, as his body gradually became fatter, something superfluous began to grow in his spirit - pride. He refused to meet with ordinary workers, since he was an authority in architecture, why bother listening to the suggestions that the Communist Youth League members were pondering? He hadn't even climbed the second floor of the construction site, staying in his office all day (who knows what he was busy with), but he complained, "All day, all night! I'm so tired..." His body grew so strong, but he always carried some pills in his pocket, "pulmonary emphysema," "phlebitis," "purpura," and "my heart is a little uncomfortable," scaring, "worn out." In fact, what was really sick was not his body, but his soul. He had become like a stagnant pool of dead water, beginning to mold and stink, but he thought he was the Yangtze River irrigating the land, boasting shamelessly in front of his old friends. All of this seems so ridiculous, and behind the laughter, there is such a powerful lash for this state of mind.
    In the above-mentioned plots, the film also vividly expresses the bright and simple personalities of Nesteratov's two friends, doctor Chizhov and livestock expert Rabin, and expresses their loyalty to friendship and their noble qualities of never tolerating their friends' shortcomings. They are energetic people. They still maintain a childlike enthusiasm for life, they still remember the vows of their childhood, to take a trip down the big river together during the holidays. Of course, we can see that this is not just for fun, but also to "cure" their friend. They deliberately pulled the character who was used to sitting in first class and international trains onto the raft in order to let him "exercise in the wind and rain" and let him broaden his horizons by looking at life "from the window of his office." They also deliberately brought him to Osokin. Didn't Chizhov say, "When we get to Osokin, we must go ashore, we have to find someone to give him two shots!" When Nesteratov began to show interest in the raft trip, Chizhov shouted happily, "Hurrah! This is a momentous event, a major transformation of the human psychological state is beginning!" These all seem like jokes, but behind these jokes, there is such a serious struggle between two attitudes towards life.
    Chizhov and Rabin have many common excellent qualities, but they also have their own unique personalities. From Rabin's song of "Why the atrium, why is the atrium so excited," we hear the trembling of a heart that is humbly pure and almost shy in the face of love; and in the scene in the Osokin hospital - Chizhov wholeheartedly performs surgery for Kaga; Nesteratov tiptoes out of the operating room, breathing a sigh of relief; and then, outside the door, Nesteratov says admiringly, "Genius!" Chizhov replies, "Fool, let's go back, Sasha is still barefoot there!" (Nesteratov also got his galoshes wet, he came wearing Rabin's leather boots.) - this highlights Chizhov's enthusiasm, humor, and simplicity. This scene echoes the scene of Nesteratov boasting in front of his old friends on the banks of the Yauza River. From here, the contrast between Chizhov and Nesteratov's different personalities and spiritual outlooks becomes more distinct. The playwright and director's technique of describing the characters' personalities in conflict through their actions and interrelationships is concise and clever. They abandoned everything accidental that could not help to set off the characters' personalities, and prominently portrayed the most essential and characteristic personalities of the characters. This is the typification of the characters. Of course, the actors' excellent acting skills are also a major factor in making the characters' images so vivid and realistic.
    The comedic plots caused by the conflict between the personalities of the three friends have both distinct satirical colors and permeate the lyrical sentiment of friendship. This is a great artistic feature of the film.
    However, the film does not limit its conflict to the narrow circle of three friends, but profoundly expresses its theme on a broader picture of life. The struggle of young construction workers against the bureaucrat Nikhoda at the Osokin construction site, this struggle also involves Nesteratov; on the tugboat, the criticism of "Moscow prefers to use foreign" bricks by ordinary workers; as well as the booming enthusiasm for labor and concern for people of those shipping workers, medical workers, and livestock workers, all of this makes us see how the corrupt bureaucratic habits are incompatible and inconsistent with the entire Soviet life and the spiritual outlook of the Soviet people. And the existence of the character Nikhoda not only foreshadows how terrible Nesteratov's shortcomings would become if they continued to develop, but also more deeply reveals the harm caused by bureaucracy, thereby making the film's ridicule and lash of bureaucracy have a deeper social significance and power.
    The scene where Nesteratov meets Nikhoda is an extremely brilliant comedic scene. It is accidental that Nesteratov lost his documents and came to Nikhoda's office wearing such an ill-fitting suit, but behind this accident, the naked truth of life is revealed. What's so strange about him being mistaken for a swindler by Nikhoda? In this situation, Nikhoda would inevitably do so. Don't think that people like Nikhoda are stupid, although they don't put their heart into their work, they know the temper of their superiors very well. And they have their own view of reality. How could this "important person" whom he had not seen even after going to Moscow three times, this superior who had never asked about his work, suddenly appear in his office in such a shabby appearance? What else could he be but a swindler? And precisely because he was mistaken for a swindler, Nesteratov saw Nikhoda's true face, recognized his essence, and saw himself in him.
    And how cleverly this comedic conflict is arranged, the interrogation by the police renders such a strong comedic atmosphere. There is not a single preaching repentance or lesson here, even Nesteratov and Nikhoda parting ways is cleverly expressed using Taras Bulba's ready-made sentence "I gave birth to you and I will kill you," and the audience will naturally draw conclusions in the midst of laughter.
    The ending of the film is meaningful. It allows us to see Nesteratov's faltering steps after his long illness. He removed Nikhoda from his post and corrected his past mistakes, but he became proud again because of this. This interlude is not superfluous at all, it is in line with the character's personality and also adds to the richness of the character's personality. But do we need to worry about his progress? Since he has two such honest and reliable friends. How well Chizhov said it: "Don't be angry, Vasya! If we don't help you, who else will?" In the sunset, the raft drifts down the river, and the songs of the three friends float from there again. How lyrically poetic is the ending of the film. It leaves us with lingering smiles on our faces as we leave the theater, and with quiet contemplation in our hearts: about life, about friendship... (Attached picture)

    在笑的后面
    ——看苏联喜剧影片“忠实的朋友”

    “忠实的朋友”是一部愉快的抒情的喜剧，充满了笑。笑是喜剧的特点，但不是喜剧的目的本身。真正的喜剧，在笑的后面，总是隐藏着一些严肃的值得人们深思的东西的。如果说旧时代的真实地反映了现实的喜剧，例如果戈理的作品，其中有着“含泪的笑”，在笑的后面是愤怒，是对整个贵族资产阶级制度的否定，是用对现实的丑恶的讽刺去引导人们从事理想的追求；那末，反映社会主义社会生活的喜剧“忠实的朋友”给我们的，却是愉快和鼓舞，它虽然讽刺了社会的反面现象，但对社会制度本身是肯定的，它使人们加强了前进的信心。这是苏维埃时代的新型的喜剧。
    “忠实的朋友”一方面用无情的讽刺鞭打了腐朽的官僚主义习气、精神的停滞和堕落；一方面也以无限的诗意展示了苏联人民身上的一切美好的崇高的品质，显示了他们在道德上和政治上的一致。官僚主义在这里是处在“四面楚歌”之中的。这正面环境和同它相背驰的反面的落后现象的矛盾，构成了喜剧冲突的基础。
    这一切在影片里是通过巧妙的艺术手法，通过人物性格的可笑的一面，通过人物性格的冲突和其相互关系的可笑的一面表现出来的。
    影片描写的是三个朋友坐着木筏顺水漂流的一次别致的假期旅行。就在这次旅行，这个短短的生活片断中，影片的制作者们使我们看到了三个朋友的性格中的一切，使我们看到了整个的苏维埃社会，看到了由不同性格的冲突、由整个社会对于落后现象的排斥所激发的无数的笑以及笑后面的意义。这笑，帮助涅斯特拉托夫摆脱了旧的思想，也提高了教育了观众。
    莫斯科近郊雅乌兹河上一只小破船里的三个淘气的小鬼，成长到三个可尊敬的学者和专家，这中间经过了许多年。而这许多年在影片上却是一段空白。可是这又有什么关系呢？难道影片没有通过这次旅行把三个朋友的最本质、最具有特征的精神面貌表现出来吗？两个朋友为了寻找涅斯特拉托夫周游了许多工地，结果却发现他没出办公室一步；那个来自奥索金建设工地的倔强的姑娘卡加，等了一个星期而终于没能见到涅斯特拉托夫，不得不愤然地提出抗议；三个朋友在出发去旅行的时候，涅斯特拉托夫一再叮咛要坐一等舱的那种语气和神态，在木筏上风雨之夜的他的抱怨和狼狈相……，难道从这些情节里，我们认不出当年小破船上的那个喜欢“显能”的船长，而现在成了建筑科学院院士的这个人的精神本质吗？站在我们面前的，是一个骄矜自持、高高在上、对生活丧失了热情的人。虽然影片没有描写他从前的经历和生活，可是我们也清楚地知道：是苏维埃政权、人民培养了他，使他有了发展自己的才能的可能，使他成了可尊敬的学者。但是他，涅斯特拉托夫，随着自己在学术上的成就的增长，随着身体的逐渐发胖，精神上却开始滋长了一种多余的东西——骄傲。他拒绝接见普通的劳动者，既然自己是建筑学方面的权威，又何必去听那些共青团员们琢磨出来的什么建议呢？他连建筑工地的二层楼都没爬过，整天关在办公室里（谁知道他在忙些什么），可是却诉说着“整天，整夜呀！累得我……”身体长得那么结实，口袋里却总揣着什么药片，又是“肺气肿”啦，又是什么“静脉炎”“紫瘢症”啦，“心脏也有些不舒服”啦，吓，“疲劳坏了”。其实，真正病了的不是他的身体，而是他的灵魂。他已经像一汪停止流动的死水，开始发霉发臭，可是自己却以为是灌溉大地的长江大河，在老朋友面前大言不惭地吹牛夸耀。这一切显得多么可笑，而笑的后面，对于这种精神状态又有着多么有力的鞭挞。
    影片在上述那些情节里，也鲜明地表现了涅斯特拉托夫的两个朋友、医生契若夫和畜牧业专家拉宾的明朗质朴的性格，表现了他们的忠于友情，而对待朋友的缺点又决不宽容的高贵品质。他们是生气勃勃的人。他们对于生活还保持着孩子似的热情，他们还记着小时候的誓言，要趁着假期三个人会齐了到大河上去漂泊一番。当然，我们可以看出，这不仅仅是为了好玩，也是为了给他们的朋友“治病”。他们是有意地把那位坐惯了头等舱、国际列车的人物拉上木筏来的，为的是让他“在风雨里锻炼锻炼”，让他开拓开拓光“从办公室的窗子向外看生活”的眼界。他们也是有意地把他带到奥索金来的。契若夫不是说过吗：“到了奥索金，我们一定要靠岸，得找个人灌他两口！”当涅斯特拉托夫对木筏旅行开始感到兴趣的时候，契若夫高兴地喊道：“乌拉！这可是件惊天动地的大事情，人的心理状态开始大转变了！”这些都仿佛只是玩笑，但是在这些玩笑的后面，又有着多么严肃的两种生活态度的斗争。
    契若夫和拉宾具有很多共同的优秀品质，但他们又有着各自的独特的个性。从拉宾的“为什么心房、为什么心房这样激动”的歌声里，我们听到了一个在爱情面前谦逊得纯真得近于羞怯的心灵的颤动；而在奥索金医院里的那场戏——契若夫全神贯注地为卡加作着手术；涅斯特拉托夫颠着脚尖走出手术室，如释重负地喘出一口粗气；而后，在门外，涅斯特拉托夫赞服地说：“天才呀！”契若夫却回答说：“傻瓜，咱们回去吧，萨沙还在那儿光着脚呢！”（涅斯特拉托夫把他的胶鞋也弄到水里去了，他是穿了拉宾的皮靴来的。）——则使我们突出地看到了契若夫的热情、幽默和质朴。这场戏同雅乌兹河畔涅斯特拉托夫在老朋友们面前的大言不惭那场戏是前后呼应的。从这里，更分明地显出了契若夫和涅斯特拉托夫的不同的性格、精神面貌的对照。剧作家和导演通过人物行动，通过人物的相互关系，在冲突中描写人物性格的手法，是简洁的、高明的。他们舍弃了一切偶然的，不能帮助衬托人物个性的东西，而突出地刻划了人物的最本质，最具有特征的性格。这就是人物的典型化。当然，演员们的卓越的演技，也是使得人物形象能够那样生动逼真的极大因素。
    由三个朋友性格的冲突所发生的那些喜剧性情节，既具有鲜明的讽刺色彩，也渗透着友谊的抒情情调。这是影片在艺术上的很大的特色。
    但影片并没有把它的冲突局限在三个朋友的狭小圈子之内，而是在更广阔的生活画面上，深入地表现了它的主题。奥索金工地上青年建筑工作者们对官僚主义分子聂霍达的斗争，这斗争也牵连到涅斯特拉托夫的头上；在拖船上，那些普通劳动者对于“莫斯科偏让用外地的”砖的批评；以及那些航运工作者、医务工作者、畜牧工作者们蓬蓬勃勃的劳动热情和对人的关怀，这一些都使我们看到腐朽的官僚主义习气，怎样同整个苏维埃生活，同苏联人民的精神面貌不调和，不相容。而聂霍达这个人物的存在，不仅预示了涅斯特拉托夫的缺点再发展下去会达到怎样可怕的地步，而且也更深刻地揭露了官僚主义所造成的危害，从而使影片对于官僚主义的嘲笑和鞭挞有了更深刻的社会意义和力量。
    涅斯特拉托夫同聂霍达会面的那场戏，是极为精采的喜剧场面。涅斯特拉托夫失掉了证件，而且穿了那么一件不合体的衣服来到聂霍达的办公室，这是偶然的，但在这偶然性的后面，却显露了赤裸裸的生活的真实。他被聂霍达误认为骗子，这又有什么奇怪呢？在这种情况下，聂霍达必然会这样做。不要以为聂霍达之类的人是愚蠢的，他们对于工作虽然无所用心，可是对于上级的脾气却摸得很透。而且他们有着自己的对于现实的看法。自己到莫斯科去了三次都没有见到的这位“要人”，从来没过问过他的工作的这位上级，怎么会突然以那么一付寒伧的样子出现在他的办公室里？不是骗子是什么？而且正由于被认作骗子，涅斯特拉托夫才看到了聂霍达的本来面目，认清了他的本质，并且从他的身上看见了自己。
    而这场喜剧冲突又安排得多么巧妙，民警的审讯渲染出了多么强烈的喜剧气氛。这里没有一句说教式的忏悔或教训，甚至涅斯特拉托夫同聂霍达的分道扬镳，也是用塔拉斯·布尔巴的一句现成的话“我生了你我也要杀死你”极巧妙地表现出来的，而观众在哄笑声中却自会得出结论。
    影片的结尾是意味深长的。它使我们看到了涅斯特拉托夫久病初愈之后的蹒跚的脚步。他把聂霍达撤职了，改正了过去的错误，可是又因此骄傲起来了。这段插曲完全不是多余的，这既符合人物的性格，并且也增添了人物性格的丰满性。但是我们有必要为他的进步担心吗？既然他有那么两个正直的可靠的朋友。契若夫说得多么好：“别生气，瓦夏！我们要是不帮助你，还能有谁呢？”在落日余晖中，木筏顺水漂去，从那里又飘来了三个朋友的歌声。影片的这个结尾多么富于抒情的诗意。它使我们离开影院的时候，脸上带着未消失的笑意，而心里怀着静谧的沉思：关于生活，关于友谊……。（附图片）
