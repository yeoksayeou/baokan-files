　　Planning This Year's Winter Rural Work
  　Rural work in winter has always been busy, and this winter it will be even busier. Large-scale establishment and consolidation of cooperatives, Party consolidation and Party building, League consolidation and League building, grain "three fixings" (fixed production, fixed purchase, fixed sales) to households, collection and unified purchase of grain and other agricultural products, conscription of new soldiers, suppression of counter-revolutionaries, winter production—these many tasks are all very important, and must be done well, not badly. Some of these tasks can be carried out sequentially, while others must be carried out simultaneously, which raises the issue of work arrangement. If arranged well, they can assist and promote each other; if arranged poorly, they will restrain and hinder each other.
    This year's winter rural work is particularly busy because the high tide of the socialist mass movement has arrived, and thousands of farmers will join agricultural cooperatives. The various problems that arise in the process of changing their mode of production and lifestyle need to be properly resolved. However, other rural work cannot be relaxed or reduced because of this. On the contrary, in order to cooperate with and promote the cause of socialist transformation, we must do them even better. Thus, this year's winter rural work appears particularly heavy.
    Given this, can we make reasonable arrangements for various rural tasks and strive to do them well at the same time? It should be said that it is possible. In the socialist transformation movement, the relations of production are changing, agricultural productive forces are developing, and the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of farmers is improving. This is the decisive factor in the success or failure of the entire rural work. As long as we grasp the central link of socialist transformation and concentrate our efforts on solving the problem of establishing and consolidating agricultural cooperatives, we can drive the overall rural work forward. On the other hand, the various political and economic measures implemented by the Party and the state in rural areas are directly or indirectly for the cause of socialist transformation. They are actually different aspects of a task and are closely related to each other. Careful rural workers will remember that, by earnestly doing a good job of grain "three fixings" to households, individual farmers see that the income of cooperative members has greatly increased, and that the state adheres to the method of "increasing production without increasing purchases," wouldn't their determination to take the road of collectivization be even firmer? Isn't the clear assessment of land yields of cooperative members providing important "fixed production" data for the work of grain "three fixings" to households? The establishment and consolidation of cooperatives, grain "three fixings" and other work often encounter difficulties in some areas, and some of these difficulties are caused by the impurity of the composition and ideology of the Party's grassroots organizations. In this case, how can we do these tasks well without first rectifying the Party organizations? In the past, some people did not grasp the central link of socialist transformation, abandoned the fundamental for the incidental, and were busy and exhausted, resulting in right-leaning errors. Some people did not make reasonable arrangements for various rural tasks, neglecting one thing while attending to another, and were overwhelmed with coping, and could not comprehensively complete their tasks. Now, the vast majority of rural workers have studied Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and their socialist consciousness has been greatly improved. The problem of grasping the key points and comprehensively arranging rural work should be solved.
    Party committees at all levels, especially the county Party committees, are responsible for arranging and organizing various rural tasks in their localities. The Party committee should distinguish between the importance and urgency of tasks and make a comprehensive plan for winter rural work. This plan should include the order of tasks, the relationship between them, the methods of coordination, and the time and manpower to complete each task. The center of this plan should be winter production work centered on mutual aid and cooperation. All other tasks should be combined with this central task and serve it. This central task reflects the fundamental requirements of the broad masses of farmers. Whoever grasps this link can mobilize the masses, and whoever relaxes this link will inevitably be divorced from the masses. No matter which region, when planning rural work, sufficient strength must be invested in this main task, while taking care of other tasks with a certain amount of strength. Under the premise of the collective leadership of the Party committee, cadres at all levels can be assigned responsibilities, so although there are many rural work tasks, they can all be done well.
    This year is different from previous years in that most regions will carry out the work of grain "three fixings" to households in winter. This work is of concern to the broad masses of farmers and is closely related to the unified purchase and sales of grain for the next three years and the development of cooperatives. This work must be done well and must not be done carelessly. However, at this time, the enthusiasm of grassroots cadres and the broad masses of farmers in running cooperatives is very high, and in some areas the peasant masses have already taken action spontaneously. Therefore, how to arrange these two tasks has become a problem that must be solved first. The current situation in this regard is: some regions have completed the first batch of cooperative establishment tasks, and grain "three fixings" work is about to begin, but many problems remain from the cooperative establishment process that need to be resolved in a timely manner. In some areas, the grain "three fixings" task has not yet ended, but the masses have spontaneously set up many "cooperative frameworks," and the timely resolution of various problems in the "cooperative frameworks" is a matter of great concern to the broad masses of farmers. People know that if a township conducts grain "three fixings" work without major deviations, it will take about twenty days. However, within the scope of a county, because the progress of work in each village is not balanced, it takes a longer time to complete the grain "three fixings" work well. Therefore, under the leadership of the county Party committee, it is bound to take into account the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives, grain "three fixings" and other work at the same time. When the Qihe County Party Committee of Shandong arranged this work, it stipulated that a member of the county Party committee should lead the cadres of the Finance and Trade Department to lead the grain "three fixings" work, and form an inspection team for the grain "three fixings" to households, to inspect the work situation on a tour; four members of the county Party committee should lead the cadres of the Cooperation Department to lead the cooperativization movement, and form cooperative establishment work teams to go deep into key areas to promptly inspect the cooperative movement; and two members should manage other work separately. All work is carried out under the unified leadership of the county Party committee, and the county Party committee regularly checks and summarizes. The Handan Prefectural Committee of Hebei has determined that the Party secretaries of the county, district, and township, and the county and district instructors should lead the consolidation of the cooperatives, and the county heads, district heads, and township heads should lead the grain "three fixings" work. The method is similar to that of Qihe and can be used as a reference for other regions.
    It is of course necessary for county and district cadres to divide their battle lines, clarify their division of labor, and take into account various tasks from the leadership aspect. However, when the work is deployed to the villages and put into actual action, it is difficult to strictly divide the battle lines. Because the same masses are relied upon for carrying out any rural work, and it is difficult for the masses to carry out two huge tasks at the same time. Therefore, when arranging various rural tasks within the scope of the village, the main task is to correctly determine the order and time of various tasks, and to coordinate the related tasks as much as possible. The so-called appropriate coordination is first of all propaganda, education and training of cadres. This is a prerequisite for completing various work tasks, and can often be carried out for several topics at once, which will have an effect on various tasks. The county and district work groups in Acheng County, Heilongjiang, helped each village formulate a winter work plan. First, they held a meeting of Party members and non-Party administrative cadres, cooperative directors, and mutual aid group leaders to publicize the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan and the significance of completing the Five-Year Plan, the benefits of "three fixings" to households and the "three fixings" policy, the principles and policies of agricultural cooperativization, and inspected various problems in agricultural cooperativization in this village in accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee. Through this education, the socialist consciousness and the idea of ​​obeying the national plan of cadres, Party members and farmers have been improved, and the necessary ideological preparations have been made for various tasks; then the work of grain "three fixings" to households and large-scale establishment and consolidation of cooperatives and the rectification of Party organizations will be carried out successively. This method can save time and manpower, and has been proven to be very effective.
    In the past, many regions encountered difficulties in arranging rural work because they overemphasized the consistency of the pace of work. In fact, this is not only impossible within the scope of provinces and special zones, but also impossible within the scope of counties. The development of various tasks in various regions is originally unbalanced, how can we force consistency? If you insist on doing this, how can you not run into snags? When the Party committee arranges work, it must estimate the various unbalanced situations, formulate several work plans, and hand them over to the lower levels to do. It is necessary to give the lower levels considerable flexibility and allow the lower levels to propose flexible solutions based on local conditions, and implement them after approval. In order to properly arrange the grain "three fixings" and the consolidation of cooperatives, the Handan Prefectural Committee of Hebei divided the areas into three types after investigation and research: The first type of area is where the grain "three fixings" to households, the purchase and sales figures have been verified, and the review is qualified. The focus is on consolidating the cooperatives, and the grain department is responsible for issuing certificates and putting grain into storage. The second type of area is where the grain yield has been assessed, but there are many outstanding problems that need to be rectified. A part of the force continues to carry out the grain "three fixings" work, and a part of the force turns to consolidating the cooperatives. The third type of area is where the grain work has not yet been started, or needs to be "reworked." The main force is concentrated on the grain work, and then the cooperatives are consolidated after the end. It should be recognized that in the transition period, the phenomenon of unbalanced work will exist for a long time. This requires consciously adapting to this situation, arranging work differently, and conducting specific and timely leadership, which can avoid many mistakes.
    It is the art of leadership that rural workers should learn to keenly grasp the urgent tasks in rural work and help the masses solve the problems that they care about most in a timely manner. We must not only be good at formulating rural work plans, but also dare to revise or supplement the original plans at any time according to the development of objective things. Recently, drought has occurred in western Guangdong, seriously threatening winter sowing. The Western Guangdong District Party Committee promptly made the necessary arrangements, so that all the cooperatives that have been established and framed, learned the method of small contracting, to carry out drought prevention and resistance, and do a good job in winter production. In this way, the most urgent production problem is solved, and the cooperative is also exercised and tested in collective production activities. This approach kills two birds with one stone, and it is equally worthy of promotion.

### 有计划地安排今年冬季的农村工作

　　有计划地安排今年冬季的农村工作
  　历年冬季农村工作都很繁忙，今年冬季农村工作更加繁忙。大规模的建社、整社，整党建党和整团建团，粮食“三定”（定产、定购、定销）到户，征收、统购粮食和其他农产品，征集新兵，镇压反革命，冬季生产——这许多工作都很重要，都是只许作好，不许作坏。这许多工作，有些可以循序进行，有些必须齐头并进，这就发生了一个工作安排的问题。如果安排得好，它们可以互相辅助，互相推动；如果安排得不好，它们就会彼此牵掣，互相妨碍。
    今年冬季农村工作所以特别繁忙，是因为社会主义群众运动的高潮已经到来，千千万万农民将要参加到农业合作社中，他们在改变生产方式和生活方式过程中所发生的各种问题，需要加以妥善的解决。但其他农村工作并不能因此放松或者减少；恰恰相反，为了配合、推动社会主义改造事业，还必须把它们作的更好一些。这样，今年冬季的农村工作就显得特别繁重了。
    既然如此，我们能不能把各种农村工作加以合理的安排，力争同时作好呢？应该说是可能的。在社会主义改造运动中，生产关系正在变化，农业生产力正在发展，广大农民的社会主义觉悟正在提高，这是整个农村工作成败、好坏的决定因素；我们只要抓紧社会主义改造这个中心环节，集中力量解决了建立和巩固农业合作社的问题，就能把农村全盘工作带动起来。另一方面，党和国家在农村推行的各种政治措施和经济措施，直接间接都是为了社会主义改造事业，它们实际上是一个任务的各个不同的方面，是互相密切连系的。细心的农村工作人员都会记得，认真作好粮食“三定”到户的工作，个体农民看到合作社社员的收入大大增加，而国家坚持“增产不增购”的办法，他们走合作化道路的决心不是更加坚定了吗？合作社把社员的土地产量评定清楚，难道不是给粮食“三定”到户的工作准备了重要的“定产”资料吗？建社、整社、粮食“三定”等工作常常在某些地区遇到困难，有些困难是党的基层组织成份不纯、思想不纯造成的。在这种情况下，如果不先整顿党的组织，怎么能够作好这些工作呢？过去有些人没有抓紧社会主义改造这个中心环节，舍本逐末，忙忙碌碌，结果犯了右倾错误。有些人没有把各种农村工作加以合理的安排，顾此失彼，穷于应付，就不能全面地完成任务。现在，广大农村工作人员学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的指示和党的七届六中全会的决议，社会主义觉悟大为提高，抓住重点、全面安排农村工作的问题，应该是可以解决的了。
    各级党委，特别是党的县委，负有安排、组织当地各项农村工作的责任。党委应该分别轻重缓急，把冬季农村工作做出一个通盘的规划。这个规划应该包括各项工作的次序，相互间的关系，衔接的办法，完成每一项工作的时间和人力。这个规划的中心应该是以互助合作为中心的冬季生产工作，其他各项工作都要和这个中心任务相结合，并且为它服务。这个中心任务体现了广大农民根本的要求，谁抓住这一环，谁就能把群众发动起来，谁放松这一环，谁就必然脱离群众。不管哪个地区，在规划农村工作的时候，都要在这个主要任务上投入足够的力量，同时以一定力量照顾其他工作。在党委集体领导的前提下，各级干部可以分工负责，那末，农村工作任务虽然多，也是可以都作好的。
    今年和往年不同，多数地区要在冬季进行粮食“三定”到户的工作。这个工作为广大农民所关心，同今后三年的粮食统购统销工作和合作社的发展有极密切的关系。这个工作必须做好，绝不能草率从事。但是，就在这个时候，基层干部和广大农民办社的积极性又很高，有些地区的农民群众已经自动行动起来。因此，怎样安排这两项工作，就成为必须首先解决的问题了。现在这方面的情况是：有些地区第一批建社任务已经完成，粮食“三定”工作将要开始，但是建社过程中遗留许多问题，需要及时加以解决。有些地区粮食“三定”任务还没有结束，群众却自动搭起许多“社架子”，及时解决“社架子”中的各种问题，是广大农民很关心的事。人们知道，一个乡进行粮食“三定”工作，如果不出大的偏差，大约需要二十天左右的时间。但是在一个县的范围内，由于各村的工作进度不尽平衡，要很好地完成粮食“三定”工作，就需要较长的时间。因此，在县委的领导上，势必同时兼顾建社、整社和粮食“三定”等工作。山东齐河县委安排这一段工作的时候，规定一个县委委员带领财贸部干部领导粮食“三定”工作，组成“三定”到户工作检查组，巡回检查工作情况；四个县委委员带领合作部干部领导合作化运动，组成办社工作队，深入重点及时检查合作化运动情况；两个委员分别管理其他工作。全部工作都在县委统一领导下进行，县委定期检查总结。河北邯郸地区确定由县、区、乡的党委书记和县、区指导员领导整社，县长、区长、乡长领导粮食“三定”工作，办法同齐河相似，可供其他地区参考。
    县、区干部划分战线，明确分工，从领导方面兼顾各种工作，当然是必要的办法。但是，工作部署到村，实际行动的时候，就很难再严格地划分战线。因为无论进行哪项农村工作，通过和依靠的都是相同的群众，而群众很难在同一时间进行两项巨大的工作。因此，在村的范围内安排各项农村工作，主要的任务是正确地确定各种工作的次序和时间，并且尽可能把互相有关的工作加以适当的配合。所谓适当的配合，首先是宣传教育和训练干部。这是完成各种工作任务的前提条件，并且常常可以把几个题目放在一次进行，结果对各种工作都发生作用。黑龙江阿城县县区工作组帮助每一个村制定了冬季工作计划，首先召开党员大会和非党行政干部、合作社主任、互助组长会议，宣传第一个五年计划的任务和完成五年计划的意义，“三定”到户的好处和“三定”政策，农业合作化的方针、政策，并且根据七届六中全会的决议检查本村农业合作化中的各种问题。通过这种教育，提高了干部、党员和农民的社会主义觉悟和服从国家计划的思想，给各种工作做了必要的思想准备；然后陆续进行粮食“三定”到户和大规模建社、整社和整顿党组织的工作。这种办法能够争取时间，节省人力，已被证明很有作用。
    过去许多地区在安排农村工作的时候发生了困难，是因为过分强求工作步调的一致。其实，这不仅在省和专区的范围以内不可能，在县的范围以内也是不可能的。各个地区各种工作的发展原不平衡，怎么能够强求一致？如果硬要这样办，怎么会不碰钉子呢？党委布置工作，必须估计到各种不平衡的情况，拟定几种工作方案，交由下级去作。一定要给下级相当的机动权力，允许下级根据当地的情况，提出变通办法，经过批准，贯彻执行。河北邯郸地委为了适当地安排粮食“三定”和整社工作，经过调查研究，划分了三种类型地区：第一类地区，粮食“三定”到户，购销数字已经核定下来，并且审查合格的，以整社为主，由粮食部门做发证件和粮食入库的工作。第二类地区，粮食产量已经评定，但遗留问题较多，需要加以整顿的，以一部分力量继续进行粮食“三定”工作，一部分力量转入整社。第三类地区，粮食工作还没有开展起来，或者需要“返工”的，集中主要力量进行粮食工作，结束以后再行整社。应该认识，在过渡时期，工作不平衡的现象将要长期存在，这就要自觉地适应这种情况，有区别地安排工作，进行具体、及时的领导，这就能避免许多错误。
    机敏地抓住农村工作中的迫切任务，及时帮助群众解决最关心的问题，是农村工作人员应该学会的领导艺术。我们不仅要善于制定农村工作的规划，而且要敢于根据客观事物的发展，随时修正或补充原有的规划。广东粤西地区最近发生旱象，严重地威胁着冬季播种。粤西区党委及时进行必要的部署，使所有已经建成和搭好架子的合作社，学习小包工的办法，进行防旱抗旱，搞好冬季生产。这样，最紧迫的生产问题解决了，合作社也在集体的生产活动中受到锻炼和考验。这种作法一举两得，同样值得加以提倡。
