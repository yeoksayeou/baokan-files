    Comprehensively Reforming Production
    Fan Rongkang
    The No. 1 meter coal seam mining team of the Ping'an Mine organized a regular cyclical operation, established a scientific production order, and created the highest record in the national coal mine for comprehensively completing the state plan. However, this is only the production order and highest record of a coal mining team; all coal mining teams must establish this production order and achieve this production record to fundamentally change the production landscape of the entire mine. Therefore, soon after the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team embarked on regular cyclical operation, Ping'an Mine first promoted the advanced experience of the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team's organized regular cyclical operation in other teams in the first pit, and then throughout the entire mine.
    When many coal mining teams were organizing regular cyclical operations, a profound contradiction arose between the socialist-type coal mining teams organized according to advanced Soviet experience and the colonial form of mine management inherited from the old Chinese coal mining enterprises, which had not yet been fully transformed.
    The coal mining team is the heart of coal mine production; coal is extracted from here. But it is only one link in the entire chain of coal mine production and cannot exist and develop independently of other links. Geological work and surveying work provide directions for coal mining, tunneling work prepares work sites for coal mining, transportation work transports coal from the site to the surface, mechanical and electrical work provides coal mining with combat weapons, and ventilation work ensures the safety of coal mining. All of these tasks are indispensable to the coal mining team, and none of them can be fully managed by the coal mining team itself.
    When a coal mining team organizes regular cyclical operation, people can use special care, full support, emergency measures, and various temporary methods to alleviate its contradiction with other aspects of mine work that are still at the original level. But when many coal mining teams are organizing regular cyclical operations, this contradiction cannot be alleviated by the same methods.
    Geological work is an important preparatory work for coal mine production, but Ping'an Mine has no geological work organization and no one is specifically responsible; none of the six inclined shafts in the entire mine have geological data worth referring to. Therefore, it often happens that when mining, a change in the coal seam is discovered, and it is thought that a fault has been encountered, the coal mining is stopped, and a lot of resources are wasted. Once, because the geological data was not clarified, three hundred meters of roadway were sent without being used. Without reliable geological data, regular cyclical operation cannot be organized. When the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team organized regular cyclical operation, a special team could be organized to investigate, but when many coal mining teams are organizing regular cyclical operation, it is impossible to organize so many teams to investigate.
    After organizing regular cyclical operation, output increased, and rail car supply could not keep up. When the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team organized regular cyclical operation, rail cars could be given priority supply; but when many coal mining teams are organizing regular cyclical operation, there are too many coal mining teams that need priority supply of rail cars, and as a result, no one gets priority supply. Whenever rail cars are sent down the shaft, the rail car watchers of each coal mining section come to grab them, and the rail car watchers of the tunneling section also come to grab them. The coal mining sections far from the rail yard cannot grab them and can only watch the work stop in the site. The mine is in a rail car dispute all day long, and everyone is shouting: Coal is mined but cannot be pulled up, how can regular cyclical operation be carried out without rail cars?
    After organizing regular cyclical operation, the progress is accelerated, and tunneling work is required to prepare new coal mining sites faster. Although Ping'an Mine's tunneling work is tightly grasped and well done, and the annual tunneling plan can be overfulfilled, not every pit mouth has a spare working face that meets the national regulations every month, and even if there is a spare working face that meets the regulations, there is not necessarily a recoverable volume that meets the regulations. What is particularly serious is that the specifications and quality of tunneling are not good, and it is often the case that the front is sending the road, and the back is renovating. The 1954 summary of Ping'an Mine admitted that this was a "fatal flaw in tunneling work." After the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team finished mining, it could not find a suitable follow-up site because the tunneling work was lagging behind, and the coal mining section that was familiar with mining thin coal seams in the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team had to be dismantled and assigned to thick coal seams.
    When the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team organized regular cyclical operation, there was a working group with full authority that could quickly help the coal mining team solve various problems. When many coal mining teams are organizing regular cyclical operation, all problems must rely on the mine's daily management organization to solve. But these organizations have bureaucracy, procrastination, and no-man's-land phenomena, which are far behind the requirements of the coal mining team.
    These are all old problems in mine management. In the past, these problems have never been so acute and so urgently felt that they need to be solved. At that time, people had not yet mastered the cycle of coal mining operations, and it could be a cycle of five shifts or a cycle of six shifts, and everything was arranged according to natural conditions. Therefore, even if the supply of rail cars could not keep up, what was so intolerable about affecting two or three hours of not being able to mine coal? After organizing regular cyclical operation, the miners seized every minute to achieve one cycle per day and night.
    Regular cyclical operation raised a series of new problems for the mine, which made many people panic. They began to doubt whether the advanced experience of the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team's organized regular cyclical operation could be promoted. They believed that the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team had a special working group to guide it and received special care, "the advanced experience was built up by cadres," and now that it is impossible to send a working group to every coal mining team and give special care, there is no blame for not being able to promote this advanced experience. These comrades only saw the surface phenomenon of the problem and only came to a negative conclusion. The No. 1 meter coal seam mining team did have a working group and received special care. This working group and these special care made it possible for the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team to break away from the constraints of the backward factors of other links in mine management and take a leap forward when organizing regular cyclical operation. Therefore, the essence of the problem lies in the contradiction between the coal mining team that organizes regular cyclical operation and other links in mine management. Sending a working group and giving special care are possible when only one coal mining team is organizing regular cyclical operation, which is an effective way to solve this contradiction at that time; and when many coal mining teams are organizing regular cyclical operation, this contradiction is more acute, and sending a working group and giving special care are impossible, so a new way to solve this contradiction must be found. This is the understanding of another group of comrades. The conclusion drawn by these comrades based on this understanding is: the management of the entire mine must be raised to a new level.
    According to the instructions of the then Ministry of Fuel Industry, Ping'an Mine carried out a comprehensive production reform. At this time, regular cyclical operation also provided a clear direction for comprehensive production reform. It shone like a mirror on the shortcomings of every corner of the mine, and it reached out to every department: asking them to reform in which aspects and solve which problems for the coal mining team - the front line of coal mine production.
    Comprehensive production reform started with the reform of organizational structure. At that time, Ping'an Mine had both mine and pit-level organizations, and the only technical force was dispersed in overlapping institutions, so that the pit was weak and the mine was not strong, resulting in unclear responsibilities and inefficient handling of affairs. The grassroots - coal mining teams and tunneling teams - could not be strengthened, and the geological work and other necessary institutions could not be established. In the production reform, Ping'an Mine abolished the pit-level organization, and the mine changed from an agency that relied on the pit mouth to lead production to a site that directly led production. Some of the main staff of the pit were transferred to the grassroots to enrich the front line of production. Coal mining sections and tunneling sections were universally established, and a production area management system was implemented. Another part of the main staff of the pit were concentrated in the mine to enrich the strength of the mine, and the mine's organization was comprehensively transformed according to the advanced Soviet experience to realize the mine's one-chief system, establish the chief engineer responsibility system, and improve the various auxiliary departments of the mine.
    The new organization of Ping'an Mine is a highly unified whole for commanding production, which overcomes the shortcomings of the old organization's decentralized and independent administration. Take transportation work as an example. In the past, the pit managed the pit mouth transportation, and the mine managed the ground transportation, and an integrated transportation system was divided. The new organization assigned the transportation work of the entire mine to the unified leadership of the transportation chief. In the past, more than 1,600 rail cars in the entire mine were divided into four stalls, fixed in four pit mouths. The mine could not arbitrarily transfer this pit mouth's "fixed car bottom," and the phenomenon often occurred that this pit mouth was in a rail car panic, while another pit mouth had idle rail cars but was unwilling to transfer them out. This is the main reason for the rail car "supply exceeding demand." After the production reform, the fixed car bottom was abolished, and the rail cars of the entire mine could be uniformly managed and flexibly dispatched, and rail car disputes were greatly reduced. Deputy Transportation Chief Wang Guozhang said that they often have more than 100 rail cars surplus now, but they did not seal up these vehicles in order to have some reserve forces. Although the comrades of the coal mining section are not as optimistic as Wang Guozhang, they cannot but admit that the climax of rail car disputes has passed.
    After the organizational reform, the various links of mine management such as geology, tunneling, coal mining, transportation, mechanical and electrical, and ventilation were strengthened relying on the original technical force, and then the reform of production technology work was carried out on this basis. In terms of geological work, some geological data were sorted out, and the distribution of large faults and the burial volume of thin coal seams were generally checked. In terms of surveying work, some important advanced Soviet experiences were promoted, and the acceptance of roadways was strengthened. In terms of transportation work, a two-level dispatching system was established, and a cage tipper was set up on the rock yard to reduce the physical labor of workers and avoid the backlog of vehicles. In terms of mechanical and electrical work, a special responsibility system for machinery above and below the well was established, and pillar pullers were equipped in coal mining sites with wooden plank false roofs to recover pit wood. The work in all aspects of mine management has become active. The slogan of the entire mine is to face production, go deep into the site, and solve problems in the front line of production. The work of the mine has taken a big step forward, and all twelve coal mining sections in the mine have learned the experience of the No. 1 meter coal seam mining team and began to organize regular cyclical operation.
    The experience of Ping'an Mine proves that after an advanced experience is produced, it always breaks through the old level and cannot be content with the old order. The responsibility of enterprise leaders lies in comprehensively improving all links of management and raising the management of the entire enterprise to a new level. In this regard, Ping'an Mine's work can only be regarded as just beginning, and there are still many problems to be solved in the comprehensive production reform.

    全面地改革生产
    范荣康
    平安矿一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业，建立了科学的生产秩序，创造了全国煤矿中全面完成国家计划的最高纪录。可是，这毕竟只是一个采煤场子的生产秩序和最高纪录；必须让所有的采煤场子都建立这样的生产秩序，都达到这样的生产纪录，才能根本改变全矿的生产面貌。因此，当一公尺层采煤场子走上正规循环不久之后，平安矿首先在一坑的其他场子、随后在全矿推广了一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验。
    许多采煤场子都在组织正规循环作业的时候，按照苏联先进经验组织起来的社会主义类型的采煤场子，同还没有来得及完全改造过来的旧中国煤矿企业的殖民地形态所遗留下来的矿井管理之间发生了深刻的矛盾。
    采煤场子是煤矿生产的心脏，煤是从这里拿出来的。但是它只是煤矿生产整个锁链中的一个环节，不能离开其他环节而独立存在和发展。地质工作和测量工作给采煤指点方向，掘进工作为采煤准备作业场所，运搬工作把煤从场子里运出来，提升到地面，机电工作给采煤以作战的武器，通风工作保障采煤的安全。所有这些工作都是采煤场子不可缺少的，又都是采煤场子本身的管理所不能涉及或不能完全涉及的。
    一个采煤场子组织正规循环作业，人们可以用特殊照顾、全力支援、紧急措施和各种各样的临时办法，来缓和它同还停滞在原来的水平上的矿井其他方面工作的矛盾。但是许多采煤场子都在组织正规循环作业的时候，这种矛盾就不能用同样的办法来缓和了。
    地质工作是煤矿生产的重要准备工作，可是平安矿没有地质工作的机构，也没有专人负责，全矿六个斜井都没有值得参考的地质资料。因此常常发生这样的事：回采的时候发现煤层有了变化，就以为遇到了断层，停止采煤，浪费了很多资源。有一次，因为地质资料没有弄清楚，送了三百公尺的巷道没有被用上。没有可靠的地质资料，就不能组织正规循环作业，一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的时候，没有可靠的地质资料，可以组织专门的小组去调查，但是许多采煤场子都在组织正规循环作业的时候，就不可能组织这么多的小组去调查了。
    组织正规循环作业之后，产量增加，车皮供应不上了。一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的时候，车皮可以优先供应；但是许多采煤场子都在组织正规循环作业的时候，需要优先供应车皮的采煤场子太多了，结果是谁都得不到优先供应。每当车皮下到井内，各个采煤段的看车工都来抢，掘进段的看车工也来抢。离车场远的采煤段抢不上，只能眼看着场子里停下工来。矿上整天都在闹车皮纠纷，大家都叫：煤采了拉不上来，不给车皮怎么走正规循环呵？
    组织正规循环作业之后，进度加快了，要求掘进工作更快地准备新的采煤场子。平安矿的掘进工作虽然抓得比较紧，做得比较好，年度掘进计划都能超额完成；但是并不是每个坑口每个月都有合乎国家规定数量的备用工作面，即便有了合乎规定数量的备用工作面，也不一定就有了合乎规定的可采获得量。特别严重的是掘进的规格质量不好，常常是前面送道，后面翻修。一九五四年平安矿的总结里承认这是“掘进工作的致命缺点”。一公尺层采煤场子采完后，就因为掘进工作落后了，找不到适当的接续场子，在一公尺层采煤场子里熟悉了开采薄煤层的采煤段，不得不拆散开来，分到厚煤层里去。
    一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的时候，有一个全权的工作组，可以迅速帮助采煤场子解决各种问题。许多采煤场子都在组织正规循环作业的时候，一切问题必须依靠矿上的日常管理组织机构来解决。但是这些组织机构有文牍主义、拖沓作风和三不管的现象，远远落后于采煤场子的要求。
    这些都是矿井管理中的老问题。在过去，这些问题从来没有像现在这样尖锐、这样迫切地使人感到需要解决。那时，人们还不掌握采煤作业的循环，可以五个班一个循环，也可以六个班一个循环，一切都听凭自然条件安排。因此，即便车皮供应不上，影响两个小时或者三个小时不能采煤，又有什么特别不能容忍的呢？而在组织正规循环作业之后，矿工们为了实现一昼夜一循环，连一分钟的时间都抓得很紧。
    正规循环作业向矿上提出一系列的新问题，这使许多人惊惶失措。他们开始怀疑一公尺层采煤场子组织正规循环作业的先进经验能不能推广。他们认为一公尺层采煤场子有专门的工作组指导，有特殊照顾，“先进经验是干部垒起来的”，现在既然不能给每一个采煤场子都派工作组、都给予特殊照顾，这个先进经验不能推行就无可责难。这些同志只看到问题的表面现象，只得出一个消极的结论。一公尺层采煤场子的确有一个工作组，得到特殊照顾。这个工作组和这些特殊照顾，使得一公尺层采煤场子在组织正规循环作业的时候，有可能摆脱矿井管理其他环节的落后因素的羁绊而向前跃进一步。因此，问题的实质是在于组织正规循环作业的采煤场子同矿井管理其他环节之间有矛盾。派遣工作组，给予特殊照顾，在只有一个采煤场子组织正规循环作业时是可能的，是当时解决这个矛盾的有效办法；而在许多采煤场子组织正规循环作业的时候，这种矛盾更加尖锐，派遣工作组和给予特殊照顾都不可能，因此必须寻找新的解决这个矛盾的方法。这是另一部分同志的认识。这些同志根据这种认识得出的结论是：必须把整个矿的管理提高到一个新的水平上来。
    根据当时燃料工业部的指示，平安矿进行了全面的生产改革。这时候，正规循环作业也恰恰给全面生产改革提供了明确的方向。它像一面镜子一样照出了矿上每一个角落的缺点，它向每一个部门伸出手来：要求它们从哪些方面进行改革，为采煤场子——煤矿生产的第一线解决哪些问题。
    全面生产改革是从组织机构的改革开始的。当时，平安矿同时有矿、坑两级组织，仅有的技术力量被分散在重叠的机构中，坑既薄弱，矿也不强，结果是职责不清，办事不灵，基层——采煤场子和掘进场子不能加强，地质工作等必须建立的机构无法建立。在生产改革中，平安矿取消了坑一级组织，矿从一个依靠坑口领导生产的机关变成一个直接领导生产的现场。一部分坑的主要工作人员被调到基层去，充实生产第一线。普遍建立采煤段和掘进段，实行生产区域管理制。另一部分坑的主要工作人员被集中到矿上来，充实了矿上的力量，根据苏联先进经验全面改造了矿的组织，实现矿的一长制，建立总工程师责任制，健全矿的各个辅助部门。
    新的平安矿的组织是一个高度统一的指挥生产的整体，它克服了旧组织的分散的、各自为政的缺点。拿运搬工作来看，过去坑管坑口运输，矿管地面运输，一个整体的运输系统被分割开来；新的组织机构把全矿的运输工作交给运搬长统一领导。过去全矿一千六百多辆车皮给分成四摊，固定在四个坑口，这个坑口的“固定车底”矿上不能随便调用，经常发生这个坑口车皮恐慌，另一个坑口车皮闲置却不愿外调的现象。这是车皮“供不应求”的主要原因。生产改革后，固定车底给取消了，全矿的车皮可以统一管理、灵活调度，车皮纠纷大大减少。副运搬长王国章说，他们现在经常有一百多辆车皮富裕，只是为了要有一些后备力量，才没有把这些车辆封存起来。采煤段的同志虽然没有王国章这样乐观，但是也不能不承认闹车皮纠纷的高潮已经过去了。
    组织改革之后，依靠原有的技术力量，加强了地质、掘进、采煤、运输、机电、通风等矿井管理的各个环节，接着在这个基础上进行了生产技术工作的改革。地质工作方面整理了一些地质资料，大体上清查了大断层的分布情况和薄煤层埋藏量。测量工作方面推广了一些重要的苏联先进经验，加强了对巷道的验收。运输工作方面建立了二级调度系统，在?石场上设置了罐笼翻?石，来减轻工人们体力劳动，避免积压车辆。机电工作方面建立了井上和井下机械的专责制，在木板假顶的采煤场子中配备了撤柱器回收坑木。矿井管理各方面的工作都活跃起来。全矿的口号是面向生产，深入现场，到生产前线去解决问题。矿上的工作迈进了一大步，全矿十二个采煤段都学习了一公尺层采煤场子的经验，开始组织正规循环作业。
    平安矿的经验证明，一个先进经验产生之后，总是突破旧的水平，不能安于旧的秩序。企业领导者的职责就在于全面地改善管理的各个环节，把整个企业的管理提高到一个新的水平上来。在这方面，平安矿的工作还只能算是刚刚开始，全面生产改革中还有许多问题需要解决。
