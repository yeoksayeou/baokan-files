　　Many Factories and Mines Fulfill This Year's Plan Ahead of Schedule
    This newspaper reports that many state-owned, locally state-owned and joint state-private factories and mines in Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu and other provinces have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule.
    In Shandong Province, 49 locally state-owned and joint state-private factories and enterprises under the Provincial Department of Industry have completed the 1955 national output value plan two months ahead of schedule. This year, due to the in-depth development of labor competitions in various factories and the education of employees on the Five-Year Plan, the socialist consciousness and labor enthusiasm of the employees have been further improved, thereby increasing output, quality, and reducing costs. Yantai Dyeing and Weaving Factory, due to the earnest implementation of semi-finished product quality standards and the strengthening of inspection work, has overcome the long-term yarn loss phenomenon, and the percentage of qualified products has increased from 85% in the past to more than 96%. Jinan Electric Saw Wood Factory improved its management and promoted advanced experience in the second half of this year, which not only overcame the waste of materials, but also reduced the working hour quota for eight kinds of wooden wares.
    The state-owned Datong Ephedrine Factory and Changzhi Flour Factory in Shanxi Province completed the annual plan 80 to 90 days ahead of schedule. Twenty-three locally state-owned factories and mines completed this year's total output value plan before October 31. More than 20 kinds of products produced in these factories and mines have overfulfilled the plan. Many factories, mines and outstanding teams of geological exploration teams have also completed the plan ahead of schedule. The Zhang Wanfu Rapid Excavation Team of Datong Coal Mine completed this year's excavation plan two and a half months ahead of schedule. The Yang Jibo and Meng Xianggong drilling teams of an exploration team of the North China Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau have completed this year's exploration plan before early October. These two teams also saved more than 27,000 yuan in funds.
    Eighteen state-owned, locally state-owned and joint state-private factories in Gansu Province have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule. These eighteen factories have greatly improved production efficiency due to the launch of labor competitions and the implementation of planned management. Lanzhou General Machinery Factory used to have many defective products every year, and it could not complete the production tasks every year. This year, in the labor competition, it earnestly implemented the production meeting system and concentrated the wisdom of the masses to improve operation methods and production tools. As a result, it completed 102.1% of the total annual output value plan on October 20, and completed 136% of the profit delivery plan. Tianshui Farm Tool Factory, a locally state-owned enterprise, adopted reasonable suggestions put forward by workers, and completed the annual plans for output value, labor productivity, profit delivery, and cost indicators before October 28.
    This newspaper reports from Laojunmiao on the 22nd that the oil refining workers of Yumen Mining Bureau have completed the annual production plan for six products ahead of schedule on November 13, and the product quality meets the standards. These six products are: light gasoline, negative ten degree light diesel, zero degree diesel, ordinary asphalt, paraffin wax and match wax.

    甘肃省已有十八个国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂提前完成今年的生产计划。这十八个工厂都是由于展开了劳动竞赛，推行了计划管理，所以生产效率大大提高。国营兰州通用机器厂往年废品很多，年年不能完成生产任务，今年在劳动竞赛中认真推行了生产会议制度，集中群众智慧改进操作方法和生产工具，因而在十月二十日就完成了全年总产值计划百分之一百零二点一，上缴利润计划完成了百分之一百三十六。地方国营天水农具厂由于采纳了工人提出的合理化建议，到十月二十八日就提前完成了全年的产值、劳动生产率、上缴利润、成本等指标计划。
