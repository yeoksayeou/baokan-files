Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 3rd November: Jiangxi Province's total grain output this year has exceeded the state-specified plan, increasing by 800 million jin compared to 1954, and more than 4 billion jin compared to the time of liberation in 1949.

This year, under the leadership of state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives, Jiangxi farmers implemented "three changes" on large tracts of land (changing single-season rice to double-season rice, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing intermediate rice to early rice), and adopted eight agricultural production increase technologies such as selecting fine varieties and appropriate close planting. As a result, early rice and intermediate rice generally increased by 4% to 8%, and many agricultural production cooperatives increased by 10% to 20% or more. Although late rice was affected by the autumn drought in some areas, most areas still increased production.

Although Jiangxi Province has always been famous for its rich grain production, before liberation, under the plunder and devastation of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, many counties could not be self-sufficient in grain. In Guangfeng County, which historically lacked grain, there was a saying: "Guangfeng harvests three times a year, but has no rice to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival." Last year, the grain produced by the farmers in this county was sufficient for the first time. This year, the county is expected to increase grain production by 8% compared to last year, becoming a surplus grain county. The Jinggangshan area, which has been short of grain for several years, also has a surplus of grain for the first time this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 2nd November: Under the leadership of more than 23,000 agricultural production cooperatives, Jilin Province farmers implemented the five measures proposed by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party to increase production: increasing the planting of high-yield crops, expanding the area of paddy fields, planting according to local conditions, expanding the area of mixed planting, and using new agricultural implements. It is estimated that the province has increased grain production by more than 490 million jin as a result.

This year, Jilin Province farmers reduced the area of low-yield crops such as wheat and soybeans, and increased the planting of 208,000 hectares of high-yield crops such as corn, millet, and rice. These high-yield crops generally had a bumper harvest, with an average yield per hectare increasing by about 1,000 jin compared to the original low-yield crops. The province expanded paddy fields by more than 17,000 hectares due to the construction of small-scale water conservancy projects. The rice planted yielded more than 130 million jin, achieving a bumper harvest not seen in three years. Most of the 100,000 hectares of low-lying land along the Songhua River and other large and small rivers, which were threatened by floods every year, were replanted with water-resistant and early-maturing crops, stabilizing the harvest. After farmers in various places promoted the experience of intercropping corn with soybeans, they not only effectively utilized the land, but also reduced the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken rows. The province's mixed planting area reached more than 700,000 hectares, an increase of 200,000 hectares compared to last year. The area of land cultivated with new agricultural implements in the province has expanded six times compared to last year. These lands have generally improved the yield per unit area due to narrowing ridges, increasing rows, deep plowing and careful cultivation.

Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, 3rd November: The autumn harvest in Hebei Province has basically ended. This year, the total output of various grain crops in the province exceeded the original plan by more than 3.8 million jin, and the yield per unit area increased by 20.64% compared to last year; the total output of cotton exceeded the original plan by more than 13 million jin (lint), and the yield per unit area increased by 2.97% compared to last year. Of the nearly 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province before the spring plowing, more than 90% of the cooperatives increased production or maintained last year's production.

According to the person in charge of the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the increase in grain and cotton production in Hebei Province this year is mainly due to the active leadership of nearly 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, driving mutual aid teams and individual farmers to carry out agricultural production technology reforms, and resolutely fighting against disasters such as drought, floods, diseases, and insect pests. Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Tongxian, Tianjin and other special districts, which are the main grain-producing areas, have all achieved bumper harvests. The Tianjin special district, where low-lying and flood-prone areas account for two-thirds of the area, often suffered reduced production due to internal waterlogging disasters in previous years. This year, with the help of the state and the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, the entire special district completed the planting reform of 2.1 million mu of low-lying land, and all kinds of crops achieved bumper harvests. The more than 70,000 mu of potatoes replanted in the special district achieved a maximum yield of 5,000 jin per mu, and generally also reached more than 1,500 jin. Except for a few areas that suffered reduced production due to drought and flood disasters, the output of most areas in the cotton-producing areas exceeded last year's level.

This newspaper reports: Under the leadership of agricultural cooperatives, farmers in various parts of Hebei Province have timely completed the sowing of more than 31 million mu of winter wheat. Agricultural production cooperatives have fully demonstrated their superiority in wheat sowing.

This year, there was excessive rainfall in various parts of Hebei Province in autumn, and many crops matured late. When the wheat sowing season arrived, a large amount of land was still occupied by late-maturing crops and could not be freed up. Some land where late-maturing crops had been harvested was also too wet, and plowing and sowing had to be delayed. However, because 60% of farmers in Hebei Province have joined agricultural production cooperatives, farmers in various places, under the leadership of the cooperatives, still completed the winter wheat sowing task in a timely manner, even though they started sowing half a month later than last year. The wheat sowing task of the Zhengzhuang Sun Luoqi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anping County would have taken at least 22 days to complete in previous years. Because the entire cooperative launched a shock competition, proposed the slogan of quick harvesting, quick plowing, quick sowing, and no idle people, livestock, or farm implements, the entire cooperative organized more than 450 male and female full and semi-laborers, adopted the method of pulling seed drills by manpower and delivering manure to overcome the shortage of animal power, and completed the wheat sowing plan eight days ahead of schedule. In Luan County, agricultural production cooperatives in 117 townships launched a campaign to plow the land during the day and sow wheat at night. According to statistics from 49 townships, more than 25,000 people were mobilized every night during the most intensive sowing days, and the wheat sowing task has been completed ahead of schedule. In order to solve the shortage of animal power and the difficulties of elderly and widowed households, agricultural production cooperatives in some counties have signed mutual support contracts.

    在农业合作社带动下农民进行生产改革
    江西吉林河北粮食增产
    河北省棉花丰收，冬小麦已播种完毕
    据新华社南昌三日电　江西省今年粮食总产量超过国家规定的计划指标，比一九五四年增加八亿斤，比一九四九年刚解放时增加四十多亿斤。
    今年江西省农民在国营农场和农业生产合作社的带动下，在大片土地上推行了“三变”（变单季稻为双季稻、变旱地为水田、变中稻为早稻）和选用良种、适当密植等八项农业增产技术。因此，各地早稻、中稻普遍增产百分之四到八，许多农业生产合作社增产了百分之十到二十以上。晚稻虽然局部地区受秋旱影响，但大多数地区仍然增产。
    江西省虽然一向以盛产粮食著名，但是解放以前在蒋贼的掠夺和摧残下，许多县份粮食不能自给。历史上一贯缺粮的广丰县曾流传着这样的话：“广丰一年三次收，无米过中秋”。去年这个县农民所产的粮食第一次够吃，今年这个县预计比去年增产粮食百分之八，成了余粮县。几年来一直缺粮的井冈山地区，今年也第一次有余粮外运。
    据新华社长春二日电　吉林省农民在两万三千多个农业生产合作社带动下，贯彻了中共吉林省委员会提出的增种高产作物、扩大水田面积、因地种植、扩大混种面积和使用新式农具的五项增产措施。据估计，全省因此增产粮食四亿九千多万斤。
    今年吉林省农民减少了小麦、大豆等低产作物的面积，增种了二十万八千公顷的玉米、谷子、水稻等高产作物。这些高产作物普遍丰收，每公顷平均产量比原来低产作物约增加一千斤。全省因兴修小型水利而扩大水田一万七千多公顷，所种水稻共产一亿三千多万斤，获得了三年来没有的大丰收。松花江和其他大小河流两岸年年受水灾威胁的十万公顷洼地，大部分改种了耐涝作物和早熟作物，稳定了收成。各地农民推行玉米带大豆等混种的经验后，不但有效地利用了地力，而且减少了缺苗断条的现象。全省混种面积约达七十多万公顷，比去年增加了二十万公顷。全省使用新式农具耕种的土地面积，比去年扩大了六倍。这些土地由于做到缩垅增行和深耕细作，普遍提高了单位面积产量。
    据新华社保定三日电　河北省秋收已基本结束。今年全省各种粮食作物总产量超过原定计划三百八十多万斤，单位面积产量比去年增加百分之二十点六四；棉花总产量超过原定计划一千三百多万斤（皮棉），单位面积产量比去年增加百分之二点九七。全省在春耕前已有的近十万个农业生产合作社，比去年增产或保持去年产量的社共占百分之九十以上。
    据河北省农林厅负责人谈：今年河北省粮、棉增产，主要由于全省近十万个农业生产合作社积极带动互助组和单干农民，进行了农业生产技术改革，同旱、涝、病、虫等灾害作了坚决的斗争。主要产粮区张家口、唐山、通县、天津等专区都获得了丰收。低洼易涝地区占三分之二的天津专区，往年常因内涝灾害减产。今年在国家帮助和农业生产合作社带动下，全专区完成了二百一十万亩洼地的种植改革，各种农作物都获得了丰收。全专区改种的七万多亩马铃薯，每亩最高产量达五千斤，一般也在一千五百斤以上。各产棉区除个别地区遭旱、涝灾害减产外，大部地区的产量都超过了去年的水平。
    本报讯　河北省各地农民在农业合作社的带动下，及时完成了三千一百多万亩冬麦播种工作。农业生产合作社在种麦中充分显示了优越性。
    今年河北省各地秋季多雨，许多农作物晚熟，种麦季节到来时，还有大量土地给晚熟作物占着，腾不出来，有些收下晚熟作物的地，也因土壤太湿，耕、耩必须拖延。但由于河北省已有百分之六十的农户参加了农业生产合作社，各地农民在合作社的带动下，虽然比去年晚半个月开始播种，仍然及时地完成了冬麦播种任务。安平县郑庄孙洛起农业生产合作社今年的种麦任务，照往年的情况，最少需要二十二天才能完成，由于全社开展了突击竞赛，提出了快收、快耕、快种和人、畜、农具三不闲的口号，全社组织了四百五十多男女整半劳动力，采取人力拉耧、送粪办法，克服了畜力的不足，种麦计划提前八天完成。滦县有一百一十七个乡的农业生产合作社，开展了白天耕地夜间种麦运动，据四十九个乡统计，在播种最紧张的那几天，每夜出动二万五千多人，种麦任务已提前完成。为了解决畜力不足和孤寡户的困难，有些县的农业生产合作社订立了相互支援的合同。
