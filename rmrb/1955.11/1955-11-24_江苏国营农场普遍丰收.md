　　Jiangsu Province's 128 state-owned farms have universally achieved good harvests this year. The seven mechanized farms alone, including Huaihai and Dongxin, produced more than 7 million jin of commodity grain, more than 710,000 jin of ginned cotton, and 150,000 jin of oilseeds. The state-owned Fengxian Farm, in its first year of operation, generated a surplus of nearly 80,000 yuan for the state, setting a new record for surplus in the first year of a newly built farm in the province. All farms further studied advanced science and technology, carried out deep plowing and close planting, and planted crops according to local conditions, resulting in generally high yields. Lianhu Farm achieved a high yield of 650 jin per mu of rice on more than 4,000 mu of land. (Our correspondent in Nanjing)

　　江苏国营农场普遍丰收
    江苏省一百二十八个国营农场今年普遍获得丰收。仅淮海、东辛等七个机械化农场就生产商品粮食七百多万斤，皮棉七十一万多斤，油料十五万斤。国营奉贤农场新办第一年就为国家盈余近八万元，开创全省新建农场第一年盈余的新纪录。各场都进一步学习了先进科学技术，进行深耕密植，因地制宜种植，因而一般产量都较高。练湖农场在四千多亩大面积土地上，获得水稻平均每亩六百五十斤的高额产量。（本报驻南京记者）
