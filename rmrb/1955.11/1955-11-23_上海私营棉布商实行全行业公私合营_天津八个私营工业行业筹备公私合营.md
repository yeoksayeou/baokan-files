　　Shanghai Private Cotton Cloth Merchants Implement Industry-Wide Joint State-Private Ownership
　　Tianjin Eight Private Industrial Sectors Prepare for Joint State-Private Ownership

　　This Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Shanghai, November 22nd. Shanghai's urban district private cotton cloth commercial sector formally implemented industry-wide joint state-private ownership on November 21st. This is another significant advancement in the socialist transformation of private commerce in Shanghai, following the industry-wide joint state-private ownership of the private woolen yarn industry.

　　Since the news of the establishment of the Shanghai Joint State-Private Ownership Songshan District Woolen Yarn Store and the industry-wide joint state-private ownership of the private cotton cloth industry in Beijing was published in the newspapers, both labor and capital in Shanghai's private cotton cloth stores have been greatly encouraged, and they have expressed their desire to strive for the early realization of industry-wide joint state-private ownership. On November 19th, the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Commercial Association held an enlarged meeting of executive and supervisory committee members and district directors to discuss this issue and formally submitted an application to the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee for industry-wide joint state-private ownership. On the morning of November 21st, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee announced its approval for the implementation of industry-wide joint state-private ownership in the private cotton cloth industry in Shanghai's urban districts. After this news spread, the employees of private cotton cloth stores in Shanghai's urban districts congratulated each other on this great event, and the streets were filled with the sound of firecrackers. The employees wrote letters to the Shanghai Store Employees' Union, expressing that they would definitely take practical actions to manage the new enterprises after joint state-private ownership. That evening, the preparatory committee for the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Joint State-Private Ownership held its inaugural meeting.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 22nd. Tianjin's private rubber, knitting, wool, linen and silk textile, vehicle, dye, cigarette, vegetable oil, and flour eight industrial sectors are currently carrying out preparatory work for industry-wide joint state-private ownership. The relevant competent departments in Tianjin will organize joint state-private ownership preparatory committees by sector in the near future.

　　On the 22nd, the competent departments of the Tianjin Municipal People's Committee convened committee members of the municipal and district federations of industry and commerce, as well as the chairmen and vice-chairmen of the trade associations of these eight industries, to discuss the issue of implementing industry-wide joint state-private ownership in these industries, and to study how to carry out the preparatory work for joint state-private ownership.

　　Prior to this symposium, the Tianjin Municipal Local Industry Bureau and the Grain Bureau had already conducted preliminary investigations and research into the equipment and technical strength of these eight industries. These eight industries have more than 1,000 factories and more than 10,000 employees, accounting for a considerable proportion of Tianjin's national economy. In recent years, with the progress of the state's work on the socialist transformation of private industry, these eight industries have basically been incorporated into the state's planned orbit in terms of raw material supply and product sales. However, most of these industries are medium-sized and small factories with backward production equipment, poor management, low product quality, and high costs, and they cannot organize production according to the needs of national construction and people's lives. After repeated consultations and deliberations between labor and capital in many factories, they all feel that further transformation and the implementation of joint state-private ownership are necessary.

　　上海私营棉布商实行全行业公私合营
　　天津八个私营工业行业筹备公私合营
    本报上海二十二日电　上海市市区私营棉布商业已经在十一月二十一日正式实行全行业的公私合营。这是上海市继私营绒线业实行全行业的公私合营以后，对私营商业进行社会主义改造的又一重大进展。
    自从报纸上登载了上海市公私合营嵩山区绒线商店成立和北京市私营棉布业实行全行业的公私合营的新闻以后，上海市的私营棉布店劳资双方都受到很大的鼓舞，纷纷表示要争取早日实现全行业的公私合营。十一月十九日，上海市棉布商业同业公会举行了执监委员和区主任扩大会议，讨论了这个问题，并且向上海市人民委员会正式提出了全行业公私合营的申请。十一月二十一日上午，上海市人民委员会宣布批准上海市市区私营棉布业实行全行业的公私合营。这个消息传出后，上海市市区私营棉布店的职工们互相庆贺这件大喜事，街道上四处爆竹声不绝。职工们纷纷写信给上海市店员工会，表示今后一定要以实际行动，来管理好公私合营后的新企业。这一天晚上，上海市棉布业公私合营筹备委员会举行了成立大会。
    新华社天津二十二日电　天津市私营橡胶、针织、毛麻丝纺织、车具、染料、卷烟、植物油、面粉八个工业行业正在进行全行业公私合营的筹备工作。天津市各有关主管部门将在最近按行业组织公私合营筹备委员会。
    天津市人民委员会主管部门在二十二日召集市、区工商业联合会的委员和这八个行业同业公会的主任委员、副主任委员座谈这些行业实行全行业公私合营的问题，并且研究了如何进行公私合营的筹备工作。
    在这个座谈会以前，天津市各地方工业局和粮食局已经对这八个行业的设备和技术力量进行了初步的调查研究。这八个行业共有工厂一千多户，职工一万多人，在天津市国民经济中占有相当比重。几年来，随着国家对私营工业进行社会主义改造工作的进展，这八个行业在原料供应和产品销售方面已经基本上纳入了国家计划轨道。但是这些行业中多数是中、小型工厂，生产设备落后，经营管理不好，产品质量低，成本高，不能按照国家建设和人民生活的需要组织生产。许多工厂的劳资双方经过多次协商酝酿，都感到需要进行进一步改造，实行公私合营。
