The autumn harvest distribution of agricultural producers' cooperatives is, in effect, a comprehensive review of the entire year's production and operation. The "Red Sun" Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Guangning, Guangdong, through this year's autumn harvest distribution, consciously reviewed the work of the past year, summarized experiences and achievements, strengthened the confidence in running the cooperative better, and also discovered some serious problems.

The entire cooperative has 397 mu of paddy fields and 1,100 mu of mountain forest. In the past, the income of the local people generally consisted of 70 percent from agriculture and 30 percent from forestry. The cooperative's management policy is: currently, agriculture is the main focus, forestry is secondary, with sideline occupations as a supplement; in the future, gradually transition to equal emphasis on agriculture and forestry; and finally transition to forestry as the main focus. According to their specific circumstances, this policy is correct. However, upon checking during the distribution trial calculation, it was discovered that this policy had not been well implemented. Of the total income, agricultural income accounted for 61 percent, forestry income accounted for 5.5 percent, and sideline income accounted for 33.5 percent. Forestry income was greatly reduced compared to the past. The reason was that the management of the mountain forests was relaxed, resulting in the loss of many pine trees and bamboo. The decline in production of some crops also revealed some loopholes in labor management. The chaos in some work-point accounts revealed many problems in financial management. Initially, some cooperative members blamed the government, the cadres, heaven, and earth for the poor performance of some production within the cooperative. After careful inspection, it turned out that the problem was with themselves.

As a result, the cooperative's leadership and the masses of members were greatly surprised, became clear-headed, and recognized in which areas they should start to improve their work. Everyone brainstormed ideas, everyone offered suggestions, the spirit of collectivism was strengthened, and they became more concerned about the cooperative's affairs.

    全年生产经营的大检阅
    农业生产合作社的秋收分配，实际上就是全年生产经营的大检阅。广东广宁“红太阳”农业生产合作社，通过今年的秋收分配，有意识地检查了一年间的工作，总结了经验和成绩，增强了把社办得更好的信心，同时也发现了一些严重的问题。
    全社有水田三百九十七亩，山林一千一百亩。过去，当地群众的收入，一般的情况是农业收入占百分之七十，林业收入占百分之三十。社里的经营方针是：目前以农业为主、林业为次、兼营副业；将来逐步转变为农林并重；最后转变为以林为主。按他们的具体情况来说，这方针是正确的。可是，在分配试算的时候一检查，发现这个方针并没有很好地执行。在总收入中，农业收入占百分之六十一，林业收入占百分之五点五，副业收入占百分之三十三点五。林业收入比过去大大缩小了。原因是对山林管理放松了，损失了许多松树和竹子。从一部分作物的减产，也检查出来了劳动管理工作上的一些漏洞。从一部分工分账目的混乱，又检查出来了财务管理工作上的许多毛病。起先，有些社员对于社内一部分生产没搞好，怨政府，怨干部，怨天，怨地。仔细一检查，原来毛病还在自己身上。
      这样一来，社内领导人员和社员群众大吃一惊，清醒了头脑，认清了改进工作应该从哪些方面着手。大家都想办法，大家都提意见，集体主义思想增强了，对社里的事也更关心了。
