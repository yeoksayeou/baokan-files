　　Xinhua News Agency, New York, 27th dispatch from TASS: The United Nations General Assembly held a plenary session on the 25th. The meeting adopted, without a vote, the Indian delegation's proposal not to further consider the Algerian question at the tenth session.

　　During the discussions, representatives from the United States and certain other colonial countries attempted to portray the Indian delegation's proposal as the United Nations having "no right" to discuss issues like Algeria, otherwise it would constitute "interference in France's internal affairs."

　　Representatives from Asian and Arab countries emphasized in their speeches that they still believe the United Nations has every right to discuss the Algerian question and that they would not abandon their original position on the matter. They expressed hope that France could seize the current opportunity to peacefully resolve the Algerian question through negotiations. Representatives from these countries said that they were not objecting to the discussion of the Algerian question being postponed at this session solely in the hope that France would return to participate in the General Assembly's discussions and decisions on major issues such as disarmament and the admission of new member states. At the same time, these countries' delegations also pointed out that if measures are not taken to peacefully resolve the Algerian question, they reserve the right to re-submit the issue to the United Nations and request that it be included on the agenda for the next session of the General Assembly.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 26th dispatch from TASS: French Foreign Minister Pinay held a press conference on the 25th. He said at the meeting that, due to the United Nations General Assembly's decision not to discuss the Algerian question at this session, he had recommended that the government decide that France rejoin the United Nations General Assembly meetings.

　　联大全会决定
　　本届会议不讨论阿尔及利亚问题
    新华社二十七日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国大会二十五日举行全体会议，会议没有进行表决就通过了印度代表团提出的在第十届会议上不进一步考虑阿尔及利亚问题的建议。
    美国和某些其他殖民国家的代表在发言中，企图把印度代表团的建议说成是联合国“无权”讨论阿尔及利亚这样的问题，否则就是“干涉法国的内政”。
    亚洲和阿拉伯国家的代表在发言中着重指出，他们仍然认为，联合国完全有权讨论阿尔及利亚问题，他们不会放弃原先在这个问题上采取的立场。他们表示希望法国能利用目前机会来通过谈判方式和平解决阿尔及利亚问题。这些国家的代表说，他们之所以不反对在本届会议上不讨论阿尔及利亚问题，只是为了希望法国能回来参加本届会议关于裁军和接纳新会员国这样一些重大问题的讨论和决定。同时，这些国家的代表团还指出，如果不采取措施来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，那末他们有权重新向联合国提出这个问题，要求把它列入大会下届会议议程。
    新华社据塔斯社巴黎讯　法国外交部长比内在二十五日举行记者招待会。他在会上说，由于联合国大会决定在本届会议上不讨论阿尔及利亚问题，他已经建议政府决定法国重新参加联合国大会会议。
