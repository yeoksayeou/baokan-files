Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 20th: According to a report by the Yugoslav News Agency on the 19th, Yugoslav Federal Executive Council Vice President Vukmanović-Tempo published an article in the Yugoslav "Communist" magazine discussing Yugoslavia's economic policy.

Vukmanović-Tempo emphasized that the post-war policy of rapid industrialization was correct. This transformed a semi-colonial Yugoslavia, which suffered enormous damage during the war, into an economically independent and industrially relatively developed country in less than a decade. Compared with the pre-war period, industrial production has doubled, and electricity production has increased nearly threefold. The production of means of production has increased nearly sevenfold, and the production of daily necessities has also increased nearly doubled.

New factories producing turbines, generators, transformers, electric motors, cables, and other electrical equipment have been established, thus ensuring an annual increase in electricity production of more than one billion kilowatt-hours. Thanks to the construction of new iron and steel plants, steel production has increased from 235,000 tons before the war to more than one million tons this year. Yugoslavia's rapid industrialization has enabled it to provide a solid foundation for further economic development.

When discussing problems in Yugoslavia's economic policy, Vukmanović-Tempo pointed out that after the war, Yugoslavia invested more than 30% of its total social production in investment every year, while also having to use another 22% of its national income for national defense. This was a great burden on the living standards of workers and staff, and it had its negative effects.

He believes that in order to ensure the speed of further economic development, it is necessary to change the investment structure, reduce investment in basic industries, and increase investment in industries producing daily necessities, agriculture, railway transportation, and housing construction. All of this will help gradually improve people's living standards.

　　伏克曼诺维奇—泰波谈南斯拉夫经济政策
    新华社布拉格二十日电　据南斯拉夫通讯社十九日报道：南斯拉夫联邦执行委员会副主席伏克曼诺维奇—泰波在南斯拉夫“共产党人”杂志上发表了一篇文章，论南斯拉夫的经济政策。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波强调说，战后迅速工业化的政策是正确的，这使一个半殖民地的、在战争中遭到巨大破坏的南斯拉夫在不到十年内变成一个在经济上独立和在工业上比较发达的国家。同战前比较，工业生产已经增加了一倍，电力生产增加了将近三倍。生产资料的生产增加了将近七倍，日用品的生产也增加了将近一倍。
    生产透平、发电机、变压器、电动机、电缆和其他电气设备的新工厂已经建立起来，因此现在能够保证每年增加电力生产十亿度以上。由于建设了新的炼铁厂和炼钢厂，钢的生产量从战前的二十三万五千吨提高到今年的一百万吨以上。南斯拉夫的迅速工业化使它能够为经济的进一步发展提供巩固的基础。
    伏克曼诺维奇—泰波在谈到南斯拉夫经济政策中的问题时指出，战后南斯拉夫每年把社会生产总额的百分之三十以上用于投资，同时又必须把国民收入中的另外的百分之二十二用于国防，因此这对工人和职员的生活水平是很大的负担，有它的消极作用。
    他认为，为了保证经济进一步发展的速度，必须改变投资结构，减少对基本工业的投资，增加对生产日用品的工业、农业、铁路运输和住宅建筑等方面的投资。这一切将有助于逐步提高人民生活水平。
