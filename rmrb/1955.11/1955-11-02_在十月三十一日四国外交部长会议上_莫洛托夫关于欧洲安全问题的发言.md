Mr. Chairman:

    We have all exchanged views on the Soviet proposal for establishing a European collective security system and the corresponding proposals put forward by France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The exchange of views shows that the participants in the meeting have not yet reached an agreement on such an important issue as ensuring European security. Although all participants in the meeting have expressed their willingness to find a unanimously agreed upon way to solve this problem, differences have arisen in the solution to this problem.

    The Soviet government has always believed that establishing a European security system in which all European countries (regardless of their social and national systems) that are willing to participate, as well as the United States, can participate, is most in line with the interests of promoting peace in Europe. The Soviet government is convinced that only this path, only replacing the path of maintaining military blocs with the joint efforts of European countries, can provide a solid guarantee for the peaceful development of the people of European countries.

    Despite the fact that we have not reached the necessary agreement on this issue, the Soviet delegation still believes that the possibility of achieving good results on the issue of European security at our meeting has not been exhausted.

    The Soviet delegation proposes to discuss the possibility of concluding a European security treaty initially involving a limited number of relevant countries. As everyone knows, the instructions unanimously agreed upon by the heads of government of the four countries tasked us with considering various proposals aimed at establishing European security, including security treaties for Europe and "part of European countries". In raising this issue, the Soviet government took into account the constructive proposals put forward at the Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Countries, especially the proposal put forward by British Prime Minister Eden. We also took into account the proposals put forward by the three countries at the current meeting.

    As for the scope of the member states of this European security treaty, we propose that the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as all other countries participating in the Western European Union and the Warsaw Pact, including the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, participate in this treaty.

    The Soviet government also agrees that other European countries that wish to join the European security treaty, such as Yugoslavia and Denmark, should also participate in this treaty.

    Of course, this raises a question about the nature of the obligations that the contracting parties of the European security treaty may undertake. We believe that the following obligations should be the main obligations of the contracting parties:

    1. Not to use force against each other, but to resolve any disputes that may arise between the contracting parties by peaceful means;

    2. Mutual assistance, including military assistance, shall be provided to any contracting party that is attacked in Europe;

    3. The contracting parties should consult with each other regarding the obligations stipulated in items "1" and "2";

    4. An organization (or several organizations) should be established in accordance with the special agreement of the contracting parties in order to conduct the aforementioned consultations and take other measures necessary for the contracting parties to fulfill their treaty obligations.

    Needless to say, in putting forward this proposal, the Soviet government believes that the existing treaties and agreements (North Atlantic Group, Western European Union, and Warsaw Pact) should subsequently become invalid, and the military groups established on their basis should be abolished. However, at present, in putting forward the above-mentioned proposal on the European security treaty, the Soviet government has not put forward a specific term of validity for this treaty or a proposal to replace it with a pan-European treaty. We believe that it is sufficient to state in the treaty that the validity period of this treaty is until it is replaced by other broader European security treaties that stipulate the replacement of existing treaties and agreements.

    The Soviet government also believes that the conclusion of this treaty should not affect the obligations undertaken by the contracting parties under existing treaties and agreements, and there should be a direct statement in the treaty regarding this point.

    It should also be stated that in the event of an armed attack, all countries have the right to exercise individual and collective self-defense as stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The obligations undertaken by countries in terms of the European security treaty should not impair this right.

    In discussing the issue of European security, the Soviet Union is not only raising the issue of its own security, nor is it only raising the issue of the security of the countries attending this meeting. While the Soviet Union expresses its legitimate concern for ensuring its own security, it cannot but link it to the security of some European countries that suffered particularly serious disasters during the German aggression when discussing this issue. These countries will naturally feel uneasy about their security due to the plans to revive German militarism and because of the existence of military blocs in which first West Germany and then a unified Germany participates. In discussing the issue of European security, we cannot but take into account the security of countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece, as well as other European countries whose people suffered serious disasters as a result of Hitler's aggression.

    It is worth noting that the "Draft Treaty on Special Guarantees after the Restoration of German Unification" does not mention at all whether this treaty takes into account the security of countries adjacent to Germany, for example. Therefore, if we talk about European security, it is impossible to circumvent this issue. It would be best to provide the necessary explanation on this issue.

    Based on the above, the Soviet delegation proposes a draft European security treaty for the meeting to discuss. The full text of the treaty is as follows:

    Draft European Security Treaty

    "With the desire to consolidate peace and believing that it is necessary to make every effort to promote the easing of international tensions and the establishment of trust in international relations,

    In accordance with the peaceful purposes and principles of the United Nations organization,

    The governments of the countries agree to sign this treaty.

    The contracting parties solemnly declare that they undertake the following obligations:

    Article 1

    The contracting parties guarantee not to use force against each other, nor to use the threat of force in their international relations, but to resolve any disputes that may arise between them by peaceful means.

        Article 2

    If one or more of the contracting parties is subjected to armed attack by one or more countries in Europe, the other contracting parties shall immediately provide the country or countries subjected to such attack with all assistance deemed necessary to restore and maintain international peace and security in Europe, including military assistance.

        Article 3

    The contracting parties shall not, under any pretext, directly or indirectly assist any aggressive country in Europe.

        Article 4

    Whenever any contracting party believes that one or more of the contracting parties is threatened with armed attack in Europe, the contracting parties shall consult with each other in order to take effective measures to eliminate such a threat. Whenever any contracting party is attacked and needs to take unanimously agreed measures to restore peace, the contracting parties shall immediately conduct necessary consultations.

        Article 5

    The contracting parties shall, in accordance with each other's agreements, organize a special agency (or more than one agency) in order to conduct the above-mentioned consultations and take other security measures necessary for each country to fulfill its obligations under this treaty.

        Article 6

    The contracting parties agree that the obligations of this treaty shall not affect their obligations under existing treaties and agreements.

        Article 7

    The obligations undertaken by the contracting parties under this treaty shall not prejudice the right of the contracting parties to exercise individual or collective self-defense as stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter in the event of an armed attack.

        Article 8

    The treaty is of a temporary nature, and its validity period lasts until it is replaced by other broader European security treaties that replace existing treaties and agreements."

    The Soviet delegation also hopes to raise another issue that is directly related to the issue of guaranteeing European security.

    As everyone knows, at the Geneva Summit Conference, British Prime Minister Eden expressed the opinion that it is appropriate to establish a special area for limiting and inspecting armaments in Europe. Everyone also knows that Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin took a favorable attitude towards the opinion expressed by Mr. Eden.

    We all remember that the instructions of the heads of government also stated: "To establish a region between East and West, within which the deployment of armed forces must be mutually agreed upon."

    This statement of "establishing a region between East and West" is in line with the proposal put forward by Mr. Eden. However, if we talk about establishing a region "between East and West", then it is clear that the dividing line between East and West should be drawn where it actually passes. However, what the draft of the three foreign ministers on establishing a region talks about is completely different. This draft talks about this region as "both sides with the restored unified Germany and Eastern European countries as the dividing line." This suggestion is not in line with the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries on establishing a region "between East and West", and it is also not in line with the reality that everyone knows. It is very obvious that we cannot ignore this.

    The Soviet government has carefully studied the various existing proposals and opinions on establishing a region, and has come to the conclusion that this issue deserves special attention, and therefore we should strive to coordinate our attitudes towards this issue, not to mention that our attitudes have many common points in many respects.

    We express our willingness to adapt to Mr. Eden's suggestion and, in accordance with the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries, propose to reach an agreement on the following issues:

    1. The region for limiting and inspecting armaments in Europe should include the territories of the Federal Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic, and all or some of the countries adjacent to them.

    2. The agreement on the regional issue should stipulate the maximum limit of the troops of the United States, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and France stationed on the territory of other countries in this region. The issue of this limit should be discussed separately.

    3. The obligations undertaken by countries in corresponding agreements regarding the limitation of armaments and their supervision must obtain the consent of those countries that can freely make decisions on this issue in accordance with their sovereignty.

    4. In order to fulfill the obligation to limit armaments within this region, joint inspections should be established for the armed forces and armaments of the contracting parties.

    Reaching an agreement between us on this issue, and subsequently reaching an agreement with other relevant countries, would be of great significance for consolidating peace and would help ease tensions in Europe. Reaching this agreement would also facilitate the settlement of the disarmament issue, because this could use a certain region in Europe as an example to show that it is possible to take these measures in terms of disarmament, and these measures can later be implemented on a broader scale.

    The Soviet delegation is willing to express this hope: These new proposals from the Soviet government—as we pointed out earlier, these proposals were drafted taking into account the corresponding proposals put forward by other participants in this meeting—can serve as an appropriate basis for bringing our views closer and can promote the four countries to reach the necessary agreement on the important issue of guaranteeing European security.

### 在十月三十一日四国外交部长会议上  莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全问题的发言

专栏：

    在十月三十一日四国外交部长会议上
    莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全问题的发言主席先生：
    我们大家曾经就苏联提出的关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议和法、英、美三国提出的相应的建议交换过意见。交换意见的结果表明，会议参加者还没有在保障欧洲安全问题这样一个重要问题上达成协议。虽然会议的所有参加者都表示愿意寻找一条一致同意的、解决这个问题的道路，然而在解决这个问题的办法上产生了分歧。
    苏联政府过去和现在都始终认为，建立一个凡是愿意参加的欧洲各国（不问它们的社会制度和国家制度如何）以及美国都可以参加的欧洲安全体系，是最符合促进欧洲和平的利益的。苏联政府深信：只有这条道路，只有用联合欧洲各国的努力来代替保持军事集团的道路，才能提供欧洲各国人民和平发展的巩固的保障。
    尽管在这个问题上我们之间还没有达成必要的协议，但是苏联代表团仍然认为，在我们的会议上就欧洲安全问题取得良好结果的可能性并没有耗尽。
    苏联代表团建议讨论关于缔结最初只有数目比较有限的有关国家参加的欧洲安全条约的可能性的问题。大家知道，四国政府首脑一致同意的指示责成我们考虑目的在建立欧洲安全的各种建议，其中包括欧洲和“欧洲一部分国家”的安全条约。苏联政府在提出这个问题时，考虑到在四国政府首脑日内瓦会议上提出的建设性的建议，特别是英国首相艾登先生提出的建议。我们还考虑到三国在目前会议上提出的建议。
    至于这个欧洲安全条约的成员国的范围问题，我们建议，苏、美、法、英四国以及其他所有参加西欧联盟和华沙条约的国家，包括德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国，都参加这个条约。
    苏联政府并且同意：希望加入欧洲安全条约的其他欧洲国家，例如南斯拉夫和丹麦，也参加这个条约。
    当然，这样就产生了一个关于欧洲安全条约缔约国可能承担的那些义务的性质的问题。我们认为，下列义务应当是缔约国的主要义务：
    一、互不使用武力，而是用和平方法解决缔约国之间可能发生的一切争端；
    二、任何一个缔约国在欧洲遭到进攻时，应互相援助，其中包括军事上的援助；
    三、缔约国应当就“一”、“二”两项所规定的义务彼此磋商；
    四、根据缔约国的特别协议成立一个机构（或者几个机构），以便进行上述磋商以及采取缔约国履行条约义务所必需的其他措施。
    不用说，苏联政府在提出这个建议时，认为现有的条约和协定（北大西洋集团、西欧联盟和华沙条约）随后应当失效，而在它们的基础上建立的军事集团应当取消。但是，目前在提出关于欧洲安全条约的上述建议时，苏联政府并没有提出关于这个条约的具体有效期限和关于用全欧条约来代替它的建议。我们认为，只要在条约中说明这个条约的有效期限一直到由规定代替现有的条约和协定的更广泛的其他欧洲安全条约来代替时为止，就可以了。
    苏联政府还认为：本条约的缔结不应当影响缔约国根据现有的条约和协定而承担的义务，关于这一点，在条约中应当有直接的说明。
    还应当说明，一旦发生武装进攻时，各国有行使联合国宪章第五十一条规定的单独和集体自卫的权利。各国在欧洲安全条约方面所承担的义务不应当使这种权利受到损害。
    在讨论欧洲安全问题时，苏联不仅提出关于自己的安全的问题，也不仅提出关于出席这次会议的国家的安全的问题。苏联一方面对保障自己的安全表现出理所当然的关心，同时也不能不在讨论这个问题的时候把它同这样一些欧洲国家的安全联系起来，这些国家在德国侵略时，遭受了特别严重的灾难。这些国家自然会因为复活德国军国主义的计划以及因为起先是西德、然后是统一起来的德国参加的军事集团的存在而对自己的安全感到不安。在讨论欧洲安全问题时，我们不能不考虑到像波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、南斯拉夫和希腊这样一些国家以及由于希特勒侵略的结果而使它们的人民遭受过严重的灾难的其他欧洲国家的安全。
    值得注意的是：在“在德国恢复统一之后的专门保证的条约草案”中，根本没有谈到这个条约是不是考虑到例如同德国相邻的那些国家的安全。因而，如果我们谈到欧洲安全时，就不可能规避这个问题。最好能够对这个问题作出必要的解释。
    根据以上所说的，苏联代表团提出欧洲安全条约草案，交会议讨论。条约全文如下：
    欧洲安全条约草案
    “本着巩固和平的愿望并且认为必须全力促使缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际关系中的信任，
    本着联合国组织的和平宗旨和原则，
    各国政府同意签订本条约。
    缔约国郑重声明它们承担下列义务：
    第一条
    缔约国保证互不使用武力，也互不在它们的国际关系中进行武力威胁，而是用和平方法来解决它们中间可能产生的任何争端。
        第二条
    凡是一个或一个以上的缔约国在欧洲受到某一个国家或一个以上的国家的武装进攻时，其他缔约国就应当立即给予受这种进攻的一个国家或一个以上的国家以为了恢复和维持欧洲的国际和平和安全而认为必要的一切援助，包括军事援助在内。
        第三条
  缔约国不得以任何借口来直接或间接地帮助欧洲的侵略国家。
        第四条
    每当任何一个缔约国认为一个或一个以上的缔约国在欧洲受到武装进攻的威胁时，缔约国应当彼此进行磋商，以便采取消除这种威胁的有效措施。每当任何一个缔约国遭到进攻而需要采取恢复和平的一致同意的措施时，缔约国应当立即进行必要的磋商。
        第五条
    缔约国应当根据彼此的协议，组织一个专门机构（或是一个以上的机构），以便进行上述的磋商以及采取各国在履行本条约的义务时所必需的保障安全的其他措施。
        第六条
    缔约国同意，本条约的义务不应当影响它们根据现有的条约和协定承担的义务。
        第七条
    缔约国根据本条约承担的义务，不应当损害缔约国在受到武装进攻时行使联合国宪章第五十一条规定的单独或集体自卫的权利。
        第八条
    条约具有临时性质，它的有效期限直到它被代替现有条约和协定的其他更为广泛的欧洲安全条约替代时为止。”
    苏联代表团同时希望提出另一个同保障欧洲安全问题有直接关系的问题。
    大家知道，在日内瓦政府首脑会议上，英国首相艾登先生表示了这种意见：在欧洲建立一个限制和视察军备的特别地区是适宜的。大家还知道，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁对艾登先生表示的这种意见采取了良好的态度。
    我们大家都记得，在政府首脑的指示中还说：“在东西方之间建立一个地区，在这个地区之内的武装部队的部署必须取得共同协议。”
    “在东西方之间建立一个地区”的这种说法是符合艾登先生所提出的建议的。但是，如果谈到“在东西方之间”建立一个地区的话，那末很明显，东西方之间的分界线应当划在它真正经过的地方。但是，在三国外长关于建立地区的草案中谈到的完全是另外一回事。在这个草案中谈到的这个地区是以“恢复统一后的德国和东欧国家之间作为分界线的双方”。这个建议是不符合四国政府首脑关于“在东西方之间”建立一个地区的指示的，而且也是不符合大家知道的现实情况的。十分明显，我们不能忽视这一点。
    苏联政府仔细地研究了关于建立地区的现有各种建议和见解，并且得出这样一个结论：这个问题是值得特别注意的，因此我们应当设法使我们对这个问题的态度协调起来，何况在许多点上我们的态度是有许多共同之处的。
    我们表示愿意适应艾登先生的建议，并且根据四国政府首脑的指示建议在下列各项问题上达成协议：
    一、在欧洲的限制和视察军备的地区应当包括德意志联邦共和国、德意志民主共和国，以及同它们毗邻的所有国家或者是其中的一些国家的领土。
    二、在关于地区问题的协定中应当规定美、苏、英、法四国驻扎在这个地区的其他国家领土上的军队的最高限额。关于这个限额的问题应当另行讨论。
    三、各国在相应的协定中所承担的关于限制军备和对它们的监督方面的义务，必须取得根据它们的主权在这个问题上可以自由采取决定的那些国家的同意。
    四、为履行限制这个地区内的军备的义务，应当对缔约国的武装力量和军备建立共同视察。
    我们之间就这个问题达成协议，而且此后同其他有关国家达成协议，就会对巩固和平有重要的意义，并且会有助于缓和欧洲紧张局势。达成这个协议也会便于解决裁军问题，因为这可以以欧洲某一地区为例子来表明有可能在裁军方面采取这些措施，这些措施以后可以在更广泛的规模上推行。
    苏联代表团愿意表示这种希望：苏联政府的这些新建议——正如我们以前指出，这些建议是考虑到本会议的其他参加国所提出的相应的建议而拟定的——能够作为使我们的观点接近的适当基础，并且能够促成四国在保障欧洲安全这个重要的问题上达成必要的协议。
