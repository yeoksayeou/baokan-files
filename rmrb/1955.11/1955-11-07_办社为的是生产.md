In the southern part of Henan Province, a drought has occurred, but some local staff are only concerned with establishing cooperatives and neglect drought resistance. A staff member in Wangdian Township, Zhengyang County, said: "As long as we do a good job in the cooperatives, we won't make any principled mistakes." The Fifth District of Xincai County did not even mention the most concerning issue of drought resistance for the masses at a recent cadre meeting. Some agricultural production cooperatives have not even sown seeds on land that is not too dry. In the cooperative led by Yu Haishan in Huangchuan County, there are 200 mu of wheat fields with moisture that have not been sown.

What exactly is a "principled mistake"? Disregarding the most urgent needs of the masses is the real principled mistake. What is the point of setting up cooperatives if production is not done well? It can be said with certainty that without taking current production into account, cooperatives will certainly not be successful.

    办社为的是生产
    河南省南部地区发生了旱象，部分地区的工作人员却只顾建社，不顾抗旱。正阳县王店乡的一个工作人员说：“只要搞好合作社，就犯不了原则错误。”新蔡县第五区在最近召开的干部会议上，根本没有提到为群众最关心的抗旱问题。有些农业生产合作社的不太干旱的地也没有播种。潢川县于海山领导的合作社，有墒没播种的麦田就有二百亩。
    究竟什么是“原则错误”呢？不顾群众的最迫切的要求，才是真正的原则错误。不搞好生产，办合作社做什么呢？可以肯定地说，不顾当前的生产，就一定搞不好合作社。
