Heilongjiang Flax Achieves Unprecedented Bumper Harvest
This year, the 48,587 hectares of flax planted in twelve counties of Heilongjiang Province, including Hulan, Boli, and Keshan, achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The average yield per hectare is over 3,100 jin of flax, and the total output of the province can reach over 137.7 million jin, an increase of more than 26% over the bumper harvest year last year, exceeding the highest record since flax planting in the province.

The main reason for this bumper harvest is the improvement of planting and harvesting methods. The Heilongjiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, through agricultural technology extension stations at the grassroots level in flax-producing counties, specifically helped flax farmers carry out technological reforms. The strip planting method was widely promoted on more than 60% of the land in the province, which increased the seedling survival rate per square meter of flax field by 50% to 100% compared with the previous broadcast sowing method. During harvesting, the method of "pulling one piece when it ripens, and pulling one section when it ripens" was adopted according to local conditions, ensuring a high yield and bumper harvest.

    黑龙江亚麻空前丰收
    黑龙江省呼兰、勃利、克山等十二个县今年种植的四万八千五百八十七垧亚麻，获得了空前丰收。平均每垧可产亚麻三千一百多斤，全省总产量可达到一亿三千七百多万斤，比去年丰收年产量提高百分之二十六多，超过了全省种植亚麻以来的最高纪录。
    这次丰收的原因，主要是改进了播种和收割的方法。黑龙江省农业厅通过各产麻县基层农业技术推广站，具体帮助麻农进行了技术改革。全省百分之六十以上的土地，普遍推广了条播的播种方法，使麻田每平方公尺植麻株数，比过去撒播的保苗率提高百分之五十到一倍。在收割的时候采取了因地制宜的“熟一块，拔一块；熟一段，拔一段”等分期拔麻的方法，保证了丰产丰收。（杨培春　康永春）
