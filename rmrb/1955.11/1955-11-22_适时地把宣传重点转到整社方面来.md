　　Appropriately Shift the Focus of Propaganda to Rectifying Communes
　　Zhong Huai
    The Party's requirement for the cooperativization movement is: to build many and build them well; to emphasize both quantity and quality. In order to achieve this requirement, it is necessary not only to fully prepare before building a new batch of agricultural cooperatives, but also to carry out rectification work after a batch of cooperatives has been built. At present, in some areas, the plan to develop agricultural cooperatives this winter and next spring has been completed ahead of schedule or exceeded. It is very necessary for the newspapers in these areas, under the instructions of the local Party committees, to shift their attention from publicizing the establishment of cooperatives to publicizing the rectification of cooperatives in a timely manner. The Shandong Dazhong Daily, Hebei Daily, and Jiangsu Xinhua Daily are all doing this.
    These newspapers first paid attention to solving the ideological problems in the work of rectifying cooperatives. After the cooperativization movement has been carried out on a large scale and at a rapid pace for a period of time, it is now necessary to temporarily stop development and rectify the cooperatives. This is an important turning point. At this turning point in the movement, there are many ideological problems that need to be solved among the cadres; if these ideological problems are not solved, the task of rectifying the communes cannot be completed smoothly, and the movement cannot continue to advance healthily. Dazhong Daily, Xinhua Daily, and Hebei Daily have all published editorials expounding the principle that the development of cooperatives must be combined with the consolidation of cooperatives, explaining that the law of development of the cooperativization movement is to advance in a wave-like manner, criticizing some people for blindly pursuing development figures, some people for hoping to realize semi-socialist cooperativization in one upsurge regardless of actual conditions, some people for only seeing the achievements of developing cooperatives and not seeing the problems in the cooperatives, and also criticizing some people for thinking that "development is easy and consolidation is difficult". Xinhua Daily also published articles by responsible comrades of some prefectural, county, and district committees. The authors of these articles, on the one hand, linked their own thoughts and conducted self-criticism of the erroneous understanding that they were afraid of developing less and being "disgraceful" and that consolidation work was effortless; on the other hand, they presented the situation and problems of the cooperativization movement in their own regions, pointing out the necessity and urgency of rectifying the communes. This is of great benefit to reminding people to maintain a clear mind in the situation of the victorious development of the cooperativization movement.
    Rectifying communes, like building communes, is an arduous and complex task. The broad masses of cadres and peasants urgently need working methods. Newspapers have a responsibility to meet people's needs in this regard. The newspapers mentioned above are doing just that. Taking Dazhong Daily as an example, after the Shandong Provincial Party Committee determined the task of rectifying communes, it quickly reported the experiences of various places in rectifying communes. Among them, there are experiences on how the Party organization of a county leads the rectification of communes, and also experiences on how the Party organization of a district or a township leads the rectification of communes; there are more comprehensive experiences on the evaluation of the means of production and other work of a cooperative, and also experiences on a cooperative dealing with a specific problem (such as the problem of draught animals, the problem of private plots). Dazhong Daily also continuously published commentaries during the process of rectifying the communes, putting forward problems in the work and opinions on solving the problems. For example, on the combination of the work of rectifying communes and the work of "three fixings" for grain, on doing a good job in the evaluation of the means of production of cooperatives, especially solving the most prominent problem of draught animals in the local area, on publicizing the "Draft Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" and using it as a weapon for rectifying communes, the newspaper expressed its opinions. Hebei Daily also reported the experiences of various places in rectifying communes in the column "Comprehensively and Deeply Launching the Work of Rectifying Agricultural Production Cooperatives". The many experiences in rectifying communes reported by these newspapers all illustrate a truth, that is, as long as the Party organization strengthens specific leadership over the work of rectifying communes in accordance with the Party's line, principles, and policies, and is good at following the mass line, the large number of newly built cooperatives can be completely consolidated. This not only points out the working methods for rectifying communes to the people, but also is a powerful criticism of those who lack confidence in the consolidation of cooperatives.
    At present, in addition to Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces, the cooperativization movement in some other areas has also entered or is about to enter the stage of rectifying communes. The newspapers in these areas should also attach great importance to eliminating ideological obstacles in the work of rectifying communes, and go deep into the process of rectifying communes to discover problems, strive to tap good working experiences, and promptly criticize erroneous practices. Whether the cooperatives that have been built can be consolidated is closely related to how well the current rectification work is done. Our newspapers should actively, enthusiastically, and proactively do a good job in publicizing the rectification of cooperatives, just like publicizing the great development of cooperatives.

### 适时地把宣传重点转到整社方面来

　　适时地把宣传重点转到整社方面来
　　锺怀
    党对于合作化运动的要求是：既要办多，又要办好；既要数量，又要质量。为了实现这个要求，不仅要在建设一批新的农业合作社之前，充分做好准备工作；而且要在建成一批合作社以后，跟着就去进行整顿工作。目前在有些地区，今冬明春发展农业合作社的计划已经提前或超额完成。这些地区的报纸，在当地党委的指示下，适时地把注意力由宣传建社转移到宣传整社方面来，是十分必要的。山东大众日报、河北日报和江苏新华日报就都是这样做的。
    这些报纸首先注意了解决整顿合作社工作中的思想问题。当合作化运动以巨大的规模和很快的速度开展了一个时期以后，现在要暂时停止发展，而对合作社进行整顿，这是一个重要的转变关头。在这个运动的转变关头上，在干部中是有许多思想问题需要解决的；不解决这些思想问题，整社的任务就不能顺利完成，运动就不能继续健康地前进。大众日报、新华日报、河北日报都曾经发表社论，阐述了合作社的发展工作要同合作社的巩固工作相结合的道理，说明了合作化运动的发展规律是波浪式地前进，批判了有些人盲目追求发展数字，有些人不顾实际条件希望在一个高潮中就实现半社会主义的合作化，有些人只看到发展合作社的成绩、看不到合作社中的问题，也批判了有些人认为“发展容易巩固难”的消极情绪。新华日报还发表了一些地委、县委、区委负责同志的文章。这些文章的作者一方面联系自己的思想，对那种怕发展少了“不光彩”、认为巩固工作不费力气等错误认识进行了自我批评；另一方面摆出了本地区的合作化运动的情况和问题，指明了整社的必要性和迫切性。这对于提醒人们在合作化运动胜利发展的形势下保持清醒的头脑是大有好处的。
    整社也和建社一样，是一个艰巨的复杂的任务。广大干部和农民群众迫切地需要工作办法。报纸有责任满足人们在这一方面的需要。上面说的一些报纸正是这样做的。拿大众日报来说，它在山东省委确定了整社的任务以后，就迅速地报道了各地的整社经验。其中有关于一个县的党组织如何领导整社的经验，也有关于一个区、一个乡的党组织如何领导整社的经验；有关于一个合作社的生产资料评议等工作的比较全面的经验，也有关于一个社处理某一项具体问题（如耕畜问题、自留地问题）的经验。大众日报在整社过程中还不断发表评论，提出工作中的问题和解决问题的意见。如对整社工作和粮食“三定”工作的结合问题，对做好合作社的生产资料评议工作，特别是解决在当地最为突出的耕畜问题，对宣传“农业生产合作社示范章程草案”和运用它来作为整社工作的武器的问题等，报纸都发表了意见。河北日报也在“全面地深入地展开整顿农业生产合作社的工作”的专栏中，报道了各地整社工作的经验。这些报纸所报道的许多整社工作经验都说明了一个道理，就是只要党组织根据党的方针政策加强对整社工作的具体领导，并善于走群众路线，新建起来的大批合作社是完全能够巩固的。这就不仅向人们指出了整社的工作方法，而且是对于那些对合作社的巩固缺乏信心的人的一种有力的批评。
    目前除山东、河北、江苏等省外，在其他一些地区，合作化运动也已经转入或即将转入整社的阶段。这些地区的报纸同样应当十分重视消除整社工作中的思想障碍，并深入到整社过程中去发现问题，努力发掘好的工作经验，及时批评错误的做法。已经建成的合作社能不能巩固下来，同当前的整顿工作做得好坏大有关系。我们的报纸应当像宣传合作社的大发展一样，积极地、热情地、主动地做好整顿合作社的宣传。
