　　The Vice Minister Niu's Grandiose Air
　　Editor:
　　On the night of July 5th, Niu Guiming, the First Deputy Director of the Organization Department of the CPC Shilong County Committee in Guangxi Province, was returning from a meeting at the Fifth District People's Government. He saw Gong Ruyi, Deputy Secretary of the District Communist Youth League Committee, and Dai Yuequn, Director of the District Women's Federation, etc., knocking on the door of the supply and marketing cooperative's wholesale department, wanting to buy noodles for a "late-night snack." So, he eagerly went to help them knock. In the middle of the night, the comrades at the wholesale department didn't respond immediately, and Vice Minister Niu became angry, banging on the door like thunder.
　　After a while, Zang Dong, a staff member of the supply and marketing cooperative, clarified the reason for the knocking and replied, "This is a wholesale department, we don't sell retail, and it's late, so we're not opening the door!" Vice Minister Niu became even more enraged upon hearing this. He shouted loudly, "We are district cadres, not bandits, why aren't you opening the door?" Then he told Zang Dong to wake up Wei Tianmin, the director of the wholesale department.
　　Zang Dong ignored Vice Minister Niu's unreasonable request. So, Vice Minister Niu went around to the back door of the wholesale department himself, woke up Director Wei, and had him open the door. As soon as he entered, he sternly scolded, "Your cooperative's cadres are so 'fucking useless,' how are you educating them?" Director Wei was baffled, not knowing what serious mistake he had made.
　　At this time, Deputy Director Fu and several other staff members of the wholesale department were also woken up. Vice Minister Niu swept his eyes across everyone with a commanding air and asked, "Who said they wouldn't open the door just now?" Everyone was so frightened that they didn't dare to say a word, so Vice Minister Niu began a "tour of insults." He asked accountant Huang Jinming if he was a formal staff member, and then pointed at Huang Jinming's nose and scolded, "What kind of cadre are you? What exactly do you do? The district government leads you, and you don't respond when district cadres knock on the door, how can you serve the people?" He asked Zang Dong if he was a temporary employee, and then stared at Zang Dong and scolded, "Who approved you? What qualifications do you have to work here? Fire you tomorrow, and send you home!"...Finally, he yelled at Director Wei again, "Your cooperative's cadres have problems: embezzlement and waste! Corruption and decadence! Misappropriation of public funds! Lavish eating and drinking!"...He scolded like this for dozens of minutes, concluding that "the cooperative's cadres are simply not worthy of serving the people."
　　Director Wei initially endured and tried to explain to Vice Minister Niu, but eventually couldn't bear it anymore. He offered a suggestion to Vice Minister Niu, saying:
　　"Minister Niu, you can talk to us properly if we have made a mistake. You can't solve the problem by scolding us like this." This made Vice Minister Niu even more furious. He roared, "If the upper beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked! The cooperative has problems, mistakes have been made, don't you know that? You have to examine yourselves; you have to examine yourselves deeply!" Then he gave the order: "The wholesale department will stop studying tomorrow morning and hold a cadre meeting to examine its mistakes. The written self-criticism should be written in triplicate: one copy for me, one copy for the district government, and the other copy for the cooperative to keep." After saying this, he led the district cadres out of the wholesale department, still full of anger.
　　The next day, the supply and marketing cooperative's wholesale department indeed wrote a self-criticism. But this kind of "self-criticism" put a serious ideological burden on the staff. Zang Dong, who had always been active and diligent, was now afraid of "making mistakes" in his work, and became dejected. Huang Jinming was also upset by the scolding and requested a transfer.
　　Vice Minister Niu's grandiose air was fully displayed, but does this kind of behavior have anything to do with his identity as a leading party cadre? The CPC Shilong County Committee must seriously examine and correct Niu Guiming's bad work style.

### 牛副部长的威风

　　牛副部长的威风编辑同志：
    七月五日深夜，中共广西省石龙县委组织部第一副部长牛贵明从第五区区公所开完会回去，路过供销合作社批发门市部。他看到区团工委副书记龚如意和区妇联主任戴月群等正在那里打门，要买面条做“宵夜”吃，于是就兴冲冲地帮他们去叫门。半夜三更里，批发门市部的同志没有及时答应，牛副部长心里就来了气，把门板打得像雷鸣似的。
    过了一会儿，供销社的工作人员臧东问清了敲门的缘由，就回答说：“这里是批发门市部，不零卖东西，而且夜也深了，我们不开门啦！”牛副部长一听更上了火。他大声吼叫说：“我们是区干部，也不是土匪，为什么不开门？”接着他就让臧东把批发门市部主任韦天民叫起来。
    臧东没有答理牛副部长这个无理的要求。于是牛副部长就亲自绕到批发门市部的后门，把韦主任叫起来给他开了门。一进门他就厉声骂道：“你们社里的干部这样‘操蛋’，你是怎样教育干部的？”骂得韦主任摸不着头脑，不知道自己犯了什么严重的错误。
    这时，批发门市部傅副主任和其他几个工作人员也被叫起来了。牛副部长威风凛凛地用眼向大家一扫，喝问“是谁刚才说不开门的”。大家都被吓得不敢吱声，牛副部长就来个“巡回辱骂”。他问清会计黄锦明是正式工作人员，就指着黄锦明的鼻子骂：“你是什么干部？你到底干什么的？区公所领导你们，区干部叫门你都不答应，你怎么能为人民服务？”他问清臧东是一个临时雇用人员，就两眼钉着臧东骂道：“你经过谁批准的？有什么资格到这里来工作？明天开除你，让你回家！”……最后他又对着韦主任骂道：“你们社里干部就是有问题：贪污浪费！腐化堕落！挪用公款！大吃大喝！……”就这样一口气骂了好几十分钟，结论说是“社里的干部根本不配为人民服务”。
    韦主任开始还忍气吞声地向牛副部长委婉地解释，最后实在忍不住了。他向牛副部长提意见说：
  “牛部长，我们有错误你可以好好说，你这样骂我们，解决不了问题。”这一下牛副部长更加暴跳如雷了。他吼道：“上梁不正下梁歪！社里出了问题，犯了错误，你难道不知道吗？你要检讨；你要深刻检讨！”接着他就下了命令：“批发门市部明天早晨停止学习，改为召开干部会议检讨错误。检讨书要写三份：一份交我，一份交区公所，另一份社里保存。”说完以后，就余怒未息地领着几位区干部离开了批发门市部。
    第二天，供销合作社批发门市部果然写了检讨书。但是这样的“检讨错误”，却使工作人员们背上了严重思想包袱。像臧东本来一直是积极肯干的，现在深怕在工作中“再犯错误”，弄得垂头丧气。黄锦明也因为挨了骂而情绪不安，要求调动工作。
    牛副部长的威风是发够了，但是这种行为难道同他是一个党委领导人员的身份有任何相称的地方吗？中共石龙县委会必须认真检查和纠正牛贵明的这种恶劣的作风。　突合
