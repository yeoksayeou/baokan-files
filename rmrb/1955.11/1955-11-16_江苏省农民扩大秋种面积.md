Jiangsu Province farmers are utilizing winter fallow fields to expand the autumn planting area and increase land utilization. According to statistics from Yangzhou, Nantong, and Yancheng special districts, as well as Taicang and Xuyi counties, more than one million mu of winter fallow land have been sown with wheat this year. Gaoyou County alone can increase grain production by five million jin after converting 100,000 mu of single-season rice fields to wheat cultivation. The 300,000 mu of wheat expanded in the Yangzhou special district have all been sown. Farmers in Taicang County, who have historically "emphasized autumn harvest and neglected wheat harvest," have also planted wheat, rapeseed, and green manure on 120,000 mu of fallow land this year. Farmers in coastal areas know that rotating green manure can increase production and improve saline-alkali soils, and they are also using some winter fallow land to rotate green manure this year.

　  江苏省农民扩大秋种面积
    江苏省农民利用冬闲田扩大秋种面积，提高土地利用率。据扬州、南通、盐城专区和太仓、盱眙等县统计，今年就有一百多万亩冬季休闲田播种了小麦。仅高邮县十万亩一熟稻田改种小麦后，就可增产五百万斤粮食。扬州专区扩种的三十万亩小麦已全部播种完毕。历来“重秋熟，轻麦熟”的太仓县农民，今年也在十二万亩休闲田里种上小麦、油菜、绿肥等。沿海地区农民知道轮植绿肥能增加生产，改良盐碱土壤，今年也利用部分冬休地轮种绿肥。　（本报驻南京记者）
