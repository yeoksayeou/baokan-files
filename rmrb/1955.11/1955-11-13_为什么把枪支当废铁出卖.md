To the Editor:

	Why are Guns Being Sold as Scrap Metal?
	In August of this year, the Finance Section of Chaoyang County, Guangdong Province, sold 28 broken Mauser pistols, revolvers, three shotguns, and over 200 pounds of scrap gun parts, which had been stockpiled within the section, to Zheng Kuozui, a peddler in Miancheng Town, Chaoyang County, for ten yuan. When the South Gui Township Drama Troupe heard about this, they bought four pistols from the peddler, intending to use them in their plays. Fortunately, this was discovered by police officer Guo Bian, who reported it to the public security organs, and the guns were recovered. After a preliminary inspection, it was found that five of the blued steel pistols could be used after repair.
	In the past, the Finance Section of Chaoyang County also dumped three baskets of accumulated damaged guns and parts under a tree where no one was watching. The public security organs retrieved some of them. Some could be used after cleaning, and others could be disassembled for use as gun repair parts.
	I believe that the Finance Section of Chaoyang County's sale and disposal of old guns as scrap metal is an act of extreme negligence. They should seriously examine this mistake in the current struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionaries.

  　为什么把枪支当废铁出卖编辑同志：
    广东潮阳县财政科在今年八月二十五日将科内积存的残破曲尺、左轮短枪二十八支、鸟枪三支和废枪零件等二百多斤，作价十元卖给潮阳县棉城镇小贩郑阔嘴。南桂乡剧团知道了这个消息，就向这个小贩转买了四支短枪，准备演剧时用。这件事幸亏被民警郭扁同志发觉了，才报告公安机关把枪追了回来。经初步检查，其中有五支硬兰短枪修理以后就可以使用。
    潮阳县财政科在过去还曾将积存的残枪和零件三筐乱抛在无人照管的树脚下，经公安机关拾回了一部分，有的擦洗后就可以使用，有的拆卸后可以作为修枪零件。
    我认为潮阳县财政科把残旧枪支当废铁出卖和乱扔乱丢，是一种极端麻痹的行为。他们应该在这次肃清一切反革命分子的斗争中认真检查这个错误。
