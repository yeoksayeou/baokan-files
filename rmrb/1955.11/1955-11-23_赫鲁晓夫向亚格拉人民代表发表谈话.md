Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, 20th (TASS): Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Khrushchev, after visiting the Taj Mahal in Agra on the 20th, met with hundreds of representatives of the people of Agra in a hall of the Mughal Fort. During the meeting, Khrushchev delivered a short speech.

　　Khrushchev, after talking about the sincere friendship of the Soviet people towards the Indian people, said that you are experiencing a glorious spring of national liberation and autonomy. But I would like to remind you that freedom and independence can only be consolidated if you are able to develop your industry, especially the machine-building industry.

　　Khrushchev then said, we have just visited a beautiful creation of human effort – the magnificent mausoleum. When I visited this mausoleum, I had two feelings. The first is admiration for the greatness of the people, their art, their culture, and their skills that flourished many centuries ago. This monument is the pride of the people of your country.

　　But I also had another feeling. I couldn't help but think about how the emperors did not cherish people's labor, how they wasted people's labor. While they were building this monument with slave labor, they were exhausting the strength and resources of the people merely to show off themselves. And this was done when obviously millions of people were dying of hunger. You can see: on one side is great wealth, on the other is poverty. Please forgive me for saying these digressions. However, I want to tell you how I felt when I saw this mausoleum.

　　Khrushchev finally expressed his gratitude for the hospitality and gifts from the people of Agra.

　　Subsequently, the Governor of Uttar Pradesh, Munshi, hosted a luncheon for the Soviet guests. The hosts and guests exchanged gifts. Khrushchev delivered a speech expressing his gratitude. He said, we are not only your friends in sunny weather. We are your friends in any weather. If there is a gust of wind, or a drought that damages the health of the Indian people, please remember us—we will never forget you.

　　赫鲁晓夫向亚格拉人民代表发表谈话
    新华社二十二日讯　据塔斯社德里二十日讯：苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫二十日在参观了亚格拉的泰吉·玛哈尔陵后，曾在莫卧儿堡宫殿的一个大厅中同亚格拉人民的几百名代表会见。会见时，赫鲁晓夫发表了简短的谈话。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到苏联人民对印度人民的真诚友情后说，你们正在经历着一个民族解放和自主的光荣的春天。但是我愿意提醒你们，只有在你们能够发展你们的工业、特别是机器制造业的情况下，自由和独立才能够获得巩固。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们刚刚参观了人类的努力的一项美好的创造——宏伟的陵墓。当我参观这个陵墓的时候，我有两种感想。第一是钦佩人民的伟大、他们的艺术、他们的文化以及他们的在许多世纪以前就已经兴盛起来的技艺。这个纪念物是你们国家的人民的骄傲。
    但是我也有另外一种感想。我不禁想到帝王们是怎样不爱惜人的劳动，他们怎样浪费人的劳动。在他们用奴隶劳动建造这种纪念物的时候，他们仅仅是为了炫耀自己而耗尽人民的力量和资源。而且这是在显然有千百万人民死于饥饿的时候进行的。你们可以看到：一边是豪富，一边是贫困。请你们原谅我情不自禁地说了这些题外的话。可是，我是想把我在看到这座陵墓的时候的感觉告诉你们。
    赫鲁晓夫最后表示感谢亚格拉人民的招待和赠送的礼物。
    随后，北方省省长孟希设午宴招待苏联贵宾们。主人和客人互赠了礼物。赫鲁晓夫致词表示感谢。他说，我们不但是你们在阳光灿烂的晴朗天气中的朋友。我们是你们在任何天气中的朋友。如果有一阵风，或是有一场损害印度人民健康的旱灾，请记得我们——我们决不会忘记你们。
