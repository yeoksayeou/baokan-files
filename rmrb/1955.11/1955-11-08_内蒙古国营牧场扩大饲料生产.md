    State-owned Ranches in Inner Mongolia Expand Feed Production
    State-owned ranches in many parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have achieved bumper harvests of feed crops.

    In the past, ranches often had to transport feed grains from distant agricultural areas, which not only increased the ranches' expenses but also, due to inconvenient transportation, sometimes prevented timely supply of feed. To overcome this difficulty, some ranches began experimenting with planting feed crops in 1953, which resulted in good harvests and solved part of the feed shortage problem. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-four ranches this year, the area of feed cultivation has reached more than 3,500 hectares, and it is estimated that 1.88 million jin of concentrated feed and a large amount of vegetables can be harvested. After the bumper harvest of oats, barley and other crops planted by the Xilingol Stud Farm this year, the cost of feed transportation was reduced, costs were lowered, and a surplus of 40,000 yuan was obtained.

    Ranches in the Autonomous Region are preparing to actively expand feed cultivation, plant various high-yield feed crops, and plan to achieve self-sufficiency for each ranch by 1957. (Zhang Zhi)

    内蒙古国营牧场扩大饲料生产
    内蒙古自治区许多地方国营牧场种植的饲料作物获得丰收。
    过去，牧场的饲料粮食常从很远的农业区运来，不但增加了牧场的开支，有时因交通不便，还使饲料不能及时供应。为了克服这一困难，有些牧场在一九五三年开始试种了饲料作物，结果收成很好，解决了一部分饲料不足的问题。今年据二十四个牧场不完全的统计，饲料耕地面积已达三千五百多公顷，预计可收一百八十八万斤精饲料和大量蔬菜。锡林郭勒种畜场今年种植的燕麦、大麦等作物丰收后，减少了饲料运费，降低了成本，获得盈余四万元。
    自治区各牧场正准备积极扩大饲料耕地，种植各种高产饲料作物，计划在一九五七年做到每个牧场都能自给自足。　（张智）
