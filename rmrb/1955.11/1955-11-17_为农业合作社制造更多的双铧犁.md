　　Manufacturing More Double-Share Plows for Agricultural Cooperatives
　　By our reporter, Gu Weijin
    With the arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, thousands of double-wheeled double-share plows that had been stockpiled in the warehouses of the Hubei Provincial Farm Implement Factory were all ordered by supply and marketing cooperatives from various regions in just a few days. Now, supply and marketing cooperatives from various regions are still continuously placing orders with the farm implement factory, saying that there is no problem with promoting double-wheeled double-share plows, the problem is that there is no stock, and they hope the farm implement factory will find a way to allocate more units. The double-wheeled double-share plows that the farm implement factory assembles on the same day are transported away by the ordering units the next day.
    The workers of the farm implement factory understand that the best way to support the agricultural cooperation movement is to produce more, better, and cheaper double-wheeled double-share plows. Therefore, they have decided to increase the production of double-wheeled double-share plows by two thousand units in the fourth quarter, on the premise of ensuring the completion of this year's production tasks.
    In order to ensure the completion of the increased production target of two thousand units, ensure quality, and reduce costs, the Party committee, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union carried out political mobilization among the workers, and the administration also took a series of measures: adjusting labor organization, strengthening technical measures, saving raw materials, and establishing a personal quality responsibility system and cost analysis system. All the workers launched a labor emulation campaign.
    In the casting workshop, the first process in manufacturing double-wheeled double-share plows, there was an advanced young worker named Deng Yanwu, who cast wheel housings. At the start of the labor emulation campaign, he proposed quality assurance conditions: prepare well before production, cast only when the molten iron reaches the right temperature, and be sure to dry the sand cores... He fulfilled his guarantee, and his yield rate was higher than anyone else's, reaching one hundred percent for eight days. There was an old worker in the workshop named Hu Biyin, who produced seven defective parts. He was extremely ashamed and thought: "Can we still produce defective products while supporting the agricultural cooperation movement?" He studied the reasons for the defective products and found ways to overcome them, and later produced very few defective products. Wang Guangfu, the leader of the final assembly team in the engine workshop, saw that the casting workshop had improved product quality and called on all the workers in his team to learn from them. He thought that he was a Party member and a Hubei Provincial Youth Socialist Construction Activist, and he could not fall behind others in supporting the agricultural cooperation movement. He led the team members to carefully study the key to improving work efficiency and found that the key was to adjust labor organization. Therefore, they promoted the advanced experience of the "plow frame correction platform," which enabled one person to do the work that originally required two people. Their original daily output was forty-three units, which has now been increased to ninety units, and they are striving to achieve an average daily output of one hundred units in November. The new record created by the final assembly team was a great encouragement to the workers in the engine workshop, and they put forward the slogan of learning from the advanced. Li Shijun, a heat treatment worker and member of the Communist Youth League, actively tried to improve the method of quenching spring screws, and the work efficiency increased from quenching six at a time to quenching twenty.
    With the development of the labor emulation campaign, preliminary production achievements have been shown. In the third quarter, it took an average of fifteen hours to manufacture one double-wheeled double-share plow. After October, it was shortened to 9.84 hours to manufacture one, and the daily output increased from a maximum of forty-three units in the third quarter to ninety units. It is estimated that the average daily output can reach one hundred units in November. The average cost of each product in the third quarter was 82.25 yuan, which was reduced to 80.0621 yuan in mid-October, and then further reduced to 77.94 yuan in late October. Now, they are striving to reduce it to 73.5 yuan in December. The quality and specifications of the products have also reached the standard level. From this production achievement, it can already be seen that it is entirely possible to complete the increased production target of two thousand double-wheeled double-share plows ahead of schedule in the fourth quarter.
    Another way for the workers of the farm implement factory to support the agricultural cooperation movement is to send people to the countryside to help farmers use double-wheeled double-share plows. Thirteen work teams, composed of more than one hundred young workers, have gone to the rural areas of thirteen counties in the Xiangyang and Jingzhou Special Zones. Life in the countryside is harder than in the city, and the language is not easy to understand. However, they did not take these difficulties to heart. The work team that went to Jianli County saw that the district's new farm implement training class lacked instructors and technical personnel for guidance, so they used a method of alternating lectures on theory and field practice to help train two hundred new farm implement operators in two districts. In Xiangyang County, the work team patiently helped agricultural production cooperatives master the technology of double-wheeled double-share plows. In the Chenhe Agricultural Production Cooperative, the members were once distressed because they did not know how to use the double-wheeled double-share plow. They said: We spent dozens of yuan to buy an idle object, and the cattle are dying and cannot pull it. The work team checked the plow and found that the moving parts and adjusting parts of the plow had not been oiled, and the rear tail wheel of the plow had not been hung up. After adding some oil and hanging up the tail wheel, the plow plowed very deeply and effortlessly. The work team also helped the farmers learn repair techniques. The members all said happily: We originally thought it was good, but we didn't know how to use it; if you didn't come to guide us, we don't know when we would be able to use it. In other areas, the work team also combined the transmission of technology with helping farmers calculate increased production accounts and accounts of improved work efficiency, etc., to eliminate farmers' concerns about using double-wheeled double-share plows.
    Now, the work of imparting technology is still in progress. The farmers who have learned to use the double-wheeled double-share plow call it "the plow in our hearts" and "the emancipation plow." They are grateful to the workers for their technical assistance. Zhu Enshu, a young member of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Limiao Township, Jianli County, said: "The worker elder brothers made new farm implements for us and also came to the countryside to impart technology. I will definitely study hard and be a good technician, promoter, and propagandist. We will definitely increase production and support national industrialization to repay the worker elder brothers for their concern for us."

　　为农业合作社制造更多的双铧犁
　　本报记者　古维进
    随着农业合作化运动高潮的到来，一直被积压在湖北省农具厂仓库里的数千部双轮双铧犁，不几天就被各地供销合作社订购完了。现在各地供销合作社还不断向农具厂订货，他们说，推销双轮双铧犁没有什么问题，问题是没有货，希望农具厂无论如何想办法多给拨几部。农具厂当天装好的双轮双铧犁，第二天就被订货单位运走了。
    农具厂的职工们懂得，支援农业合作化运动的最好办法，就是生产更多、更好、更便宜的双轮双铧犁，所以，他们决定在第四季度，在保证完成今年生产任务的基础上，增产双轮双铧犁二千部。
    为了保证完成两千部的增产任务，保证质量和降低成本，党委、青年团和工会在职工中进行了政治动员，行政上也作了一系列的措施：调整劳动组织，加强技术措施，节约原材料，建立个人质量负责制和成本分析制。全体职工展开了劳动竞赛。
    在制造双轮双铧犁的第一道工序的铸工车间，有个浇铸轮壳的先进青年工人邓衍武，劳动竞赛一开始，就提出保证质量的条件：做好生产前的准备工作，铁水合温度才铸，砂芯一定要烘干……他实现了自己的保证，成品率比谁都高，有八天竟达到了百分之百。车间里有个老工人叫胡必银，这时却出了七个废品零件。他惭愧极了，想道：“支援农业合作化运动还能出废品吗？”他研究了出废品的原因，找出克服的办法，后来就很少出废品了。引擎车间总装配组组长王光福看见铸工车间提高产品质量以后，号召全组工人向他们看齐。他想自己是个党员，又是湖北省青年社会主义建设积极分子，支援农业合作化运动决不能落在别人后面。他领导组员认真研究提高工作效率的关键，发现关键在于调整劳动组织。于是他们推广了“犁架校正台”的先进经验，使原来两个人的工作用一个人来做。他们原来的日产量是四十三台，现在已提高到九十台，还要争取十一月份平均日产量达到一百台。总装配组创造的新纪录，对于引擎车间工人是个很大的鼓动，他们提出了向先进看齐的口号。热处理工人、青年团员李士俊积极设法改进淬弹簧螺丝的方法，工作效率由一次淬六个提高到淬二十个。
    随着劳动竞赛的开展，初步的生产成就显示出来了。第三季度是平均十五小时制造一台双轮双铧犁，十月份以后，缩短到九点八四小时制造一台，日产量由第三季度的最高四十三台，增加到九十台，十一月份预计平均日产量可以达到一百台。第三季度每台产品的平均成本是八二点二五元，十月中旬降低到八○点○六二一元，十月下旬以后又降低到七七点九四元。现在，他们争取在十二月份降低到七三点五元。产品的质量和规格也都达到了标准水平。从这个生产成就里，已经可以看出，第四季度有充分可能提前完成两千部双轮双铧犁的增产任务。
    农具厂职工们支援农业合作化运动的另一个办法，就是派人下乡帮助农民使用双轮双铧犁。由一百多名青年工人组成的十三个工作小组，已分赴襄阳和荆州专区十三个县的农村。乡下的生活比城市艰苦，话又不大好懂。但是，他们没有把这些困难放在心里。到监利县的工作小组，看见区里的新式农具训练班没有教授和辅导的技术人员，就用讲授理论和田间实习交错进行的办法，帮助两个区训练了二百名新式农具手。在襄阳县，工作小组非常耐心帮助农业生产合作社掌握双轮双铧犁的技术。在陈河农业生产合作社里，社员们曾因不会使用双轮双铧犁而苦闷。他们说：花了几十块钱买了个闲物，牛拉死了也拉不动。工作组把犁检查了一遍，发现原来犁的活动部分和调节部分没有加油，而且没有把犁的后面尾轮挂起来。加了些油，把尾轮挂起以后，犁耕得很深也很省力。工作组还帮助农民们学会修理技术。社员们都高兴地说：我们本来就认为它好，可是不会用；你们不来指点，我们不知道到什么时候才会使用。在另一些地区，工作组还结合传授技术，采取帮助农民算增产账、算提高工作效率账等办法，消除农民对于使用双轮双铧犁的顾虑。
    现在，传授技术工作还在进行。学会了使用双轮双铧犁的农民，把双轮双铧犁叫做“心上的犁”、“翻身犁”。他们感激工人们对他们的技术帮助。监利县李庙乡先锋农业生产合作社青年社员朱恩恕说：“工人老大哥给我们制造了新式农具，还下乡来传授技术。我一定努力学习，做一个好技术员、推销员、宣传员。我们一定增加生产，支援国家工业化，来报答工人老大哥对我们的关怀。”
