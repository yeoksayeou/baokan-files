Shanghai, November 24th (Reporter from this newspaper) - The CCP Central Committee Shanghai Bureau held an enlarged meeting from November 9th to 10th to review the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in the Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions, and to discuss a comprehensive plan for future work in order to further promote the transformation of private industry and commerce in these three regions.

The meeting considered that the past work of transforming private industry and commerce in the Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions had been successful. This year, the output value of joint state-private industrial enterprises in Shanghai has accounted for 45 percent of the original total output value of private industry. By the end of September, the number of joint state-private industrial enterprises in the city had increased to 326, and the output value of private factories accepting state processing orders accounted for more than 90 percent of the total output value of private factories in the city. In Jiangsu Province, the number of joint state-private industrial enterprises has also increased to 261, with an output value accounting for 49.75 percent of the total output value of private industry. In Zhejiang Province, the number of joint state-private enterprises has increased to 338, with an output value accounting for 43.9 percent of the total output value of private industry. The output value of private factories in both provinces accepting processing orders has exceeded 80 percent of the total output value of private factories. The transformation of private commerce in the three regions has also made progress. Especially since this year, in accordance with the central government's policy of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement," the transformation of private industry and commerce has adopted the method of arranging entire trades and industries and joint state-private ownership, which has greatly advanced the transformation work and created many experiences for the future transformation of private industry and commerce.

The meeting also pointed out that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in the Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang regions in the past was far from meeting the needs of the situation. Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang are among the most concentrated areas of industry and commerce in our country. With the development of national construction and the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the state requires Shanghai and other regions to supply more industrial products. Although most of the private enterprises in Shanghai and other places have been incorporated into the national plan through processing orders and other forms, due to the fact that the capitalist ownership has not been changed, the production potential cannot be brought into play. Especially in recent years, with the strengthening of the planning of the national economy, the contradictions have become more prominent. The vast number of workers and activists among the capitalists have asked to implement joint state-private ownership. Therefore, under the current situation, it is fully favorable to advance the transformation of private industry and commerce in these three regions to a new stage.

The meeting studied the methods and steps for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in the three regions, and pointed out that the basic method of transformation in the future is: from the lower forms of state capitalism to the higher forms, from the joint state-private ownership of individual enterprises to the joint state-private ownership of the entire industry; for private enterprises that need to implement joint state-private ownership in batches within a certain period, management must also be strengthened and incorporated into the national plan separately. The main form of transformation of private industry is joint state-private ownership, especially joint state-private ownership of the entire industry, and various auxiliary forms can also be adopted, such as the merger of factories based on the production of certain products. Enterprises with special conditions can still adopt the method of individual joint state-private ownership.

The meeting emphasized that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce must be carried out in a planned and orderly manner. The meeting discussed the comprehensive plan for the transformation of private industry and commerce in the three regions in the future, and required all departments to earnestly make specific comprehensive plans. In order to ensure that the work is carried out in an orderly manner, the meeting decided to carry out the work in three steps, namely the preparation stage, the joint state-private ownership stage, and the enterprise transformation stage after joint state-private ownership. At present, it is first necessary to unify the thinking within the Party, strengthen ideological leadership, and at the same time, sum up the existing work experience, especially the experience of the transformation of the entire industry. It is also necessary to concentrate a group of cadres to prepare for the establishment of specialized companies in various industries, organize work teams, and strengthen the Party's work in private enterprises. All departments must fully mobilize the masses, especially the workers in private enterprises, and also pay attention to absorbing activists among the capitalists to participate in the work.

The meeting criticized the shortcomings of the past in not actively leading the capitalists' studies, criticized some erroneous views in this regard, and proposed to enthusiastically assist organizations such as the Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Democratic National Construction Association to organize capitalists to study on a large scale and regularly. Recently, it is first necessary to assist the Federations of Industry and Commerce in the three regions to do a good job in conveying the spirit of the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and require that every capitalist can hear the transmission. Serious criticism and handling must also be carried out for the illegal activities that still exist among some capitalists.

### 中共中央上海局举行扩大会议　规划对私营工商业的改造

　　中共中央上海局举行扩大会议
　　规划对私营工商业的改造
    本报上海二十四日电　中共中央上海局在十一月九日至十日召开了扩大会议，检查了上海、江苏、浙江地区对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作，讨论了今后工作的全面规划，以便在这三个地区进一步开展对私营工商业的改造工作。
    会议认为上海、江苏、浙江三个地区过去对私营工商业的改造工作是有成绩的。今年上海市公私合营工业的产值，已经占到原有私营工业总产值的百分之四十五。到九月份止，全市公私合营工业企业已经增加到三百二十六户，接受国家加工订货的私营工厂的产值，已占全市私营工厂总产值的百分之九十以上。江苏省公私合营工业企业，也已增加到二百六十一个，产值占私营工业总产值的百分之四十九点七五。浙江省公私合营企业已增加到三百三十八个，产值占私营工业总产值的百分之四十三点九。两省私营工厂接受加工订货的产值都已超过私营工厂总产值的百分之八十。三个地区私营商业的改造也有了进展。特别从今年以来，根据中央
  “统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，对私营工商业的改造采取了整行整业安排、公私合营的方式，把改造工作大大地往前推进了一步，为今后对私营工商业的改造创造了许多经验。
    会议同时指出：过去上海、江苏、浙江三个地区对私营工商业的社会主义改造工作，还远远不能适应形势的需要。上海市和江苏浙江两省是我国工商业最集中的地区之一，随着国家建设的发展，农业合作化高潮的到来，国家要求上海等地区供应更多的工业产品。而上海等地的大部分私营企业，虽然过去已分别通过加工订货等各种形式纳入国家计划，但由于资本主义所有制没有改变，生产潜力不能发挥，尤其是近年来随着国民经济计划性的加强，矛盾更加突出，许多企业本身也困难万状，广大职工和资本家中的积极分子，纷纷要求实行公私合营。因此在目前的形势下，把这三个地区私营工商业的改造推进到新的阶段，是有充分有利条件的。
    会议研究了三个地区私营工商业社会主义改造工作的方式和步骤，指出今后改造工作的基本方式是：由国家资本主义的低级形式到高级形式，由个别企业的公私合营到全行业的公私合营；对需要在一定时期内分批实行公私合营的私营企业，也必须加强管理，分别纳入国家计划。私营工业改造的主要形式是公私合营，特别是全行业的公私合营，同时还可以采用各种辅助性形式，如以生产某种产品为基础的各厂合并合营。具有特殊条件的企业，仍可采用个别公私合营的方式。
    会议强调对私营工商业的社会主义改造必须有规划、有秩序地进行。会议讨论了三个地区今后对私营工商业改造的全面规划，并要求各部门认真地作好具体的全面规划。为了保证工作有秩序地进行，会议决定分作三个步骤进行工作，即准备阶段、公私合营阶段和公私合营后的企业改造阶段。目前首先要统一党内思想，加强思想领导，同时很好总结已有的工作经验，特别是全行业改造的经验。还要集中一批干部力量，准备成立各行各业的专业公司，组织工作组，加强私营企业中党的工作。各部门要把群众充分发动起来，特别是把私营企业中的工人发动起来，同时也要注意吸收资本家中的积极分子参加工作。
    会议批评了过去对资本家的学习不积极领导的缺点，批判了在这方面的一些错误观点，提出要热情地协助工商业联合会、民主建国会等组织，大规模地、经常地组织资本家学习。最近要首先协助三个地区的工商业联合会做好全国工商联第一届执行委员会第二次会议的传达工作，要求做到每个资本家都能听到传达。对于一部分资本家中仍然存在的违法行为，也必须进行严肃的批评和处理。
