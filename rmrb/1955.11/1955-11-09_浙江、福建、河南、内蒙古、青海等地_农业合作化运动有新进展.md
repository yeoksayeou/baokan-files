Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Other Places
New Progress in the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement

    This newspaper reports Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Guangxi, Inner Mongolia, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Qinghai and other places have made new progress in the agricultural cooperativization movement.

    In Zhejiang Province, as of October 28, more than 25,700 new cooperatives had been established throughout the province. Including the new members absorbed by the old cooperatives, more than 750,000 households have newly joined the cooperatives. At present, including the original cooperatives, there are more than 63,200 cooperatives in the province, with a total of more than 1.63 million members, accounting for 33 percent of the total number of farm households in the province. In order to study the overall situation of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the province, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of the secretary of the local party committee in late October. The meeting decided to organize all levels of party committees and all cadres to study again Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperativization and the Sixth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party's resolution on agricultural cooperativization. The meeting required party committees at all levels to summarize and check the work of the previous stage, and to study how to improve quality in the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives.

    In Fujian Province, by the end of October, more than 20,000 new cooperatives had been established and prepared, and more than 19,000 old cooperatives had also absorbed a large number of new members. The number of cooperative member households in the province has increased from more than 420,000 households at the end of August to about 1.1 million households, accounting for about 40 percent of the total number of farm households in the province, exceeding the plan of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for development this winter and next spring by more than 10 percent. At present, the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement in various places is still continuing.

    The agricultural cooperativization movement in Henan Province has entered a climax. By the end of October, more than 69,000 new cooperatives in the first batch had been built or were about to be built throughout the province. Together with the original cooperatives, there were more than 113,100 agricultural production cooperatives in the province, with more than 3,528,900 cooperative member households, accounting for 36.66 percent of the total number of farm households in the province. The upsurge of agricultural cooperativization in Henan Province appeared in some areas last winter. After September this year, county, district, and township cadres' meetings were generally held throughout the province to conscientiously study Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperativization. After the meeting, all localities conscientiously implemented Chairman Mao's instructions, promoted the development of agricultural cooperativization, and by mid-October, an upsurge of agricultural cooperativization had appeared everywhere in the province.

    The agricultural cooperativization movement in Guangxi Province is also gradually forming an upsurge. As of November 3, more than 40,000 new cooperatives had been built and were being established throughout the province. Together with the original more than 15,000 old cooperatives, there are already more than 55,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province. According to preliminary statistics, more than 1.2 million farm households have signed up to join cooperatives, close to completing the target set by the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China for absorbing farmers into cooperatives this winter and next spring.

    In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 7,000 mutual aid teams are currently applying to transfer to cooperatives. The region has established 1,572 new cooperatives, with more than 30,000 cooperative member households. On October 26, some members of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China led more than 1,000 cadres of all ethnic groups drawn from autonomous region-level agencies and organizations to various leagues and rural areas to develop agricultural production cooperatives on the basis of carrying out the work of "three fixings" of grain to households in batches. By the beginning of spring plowing next year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the region will have developed to 11,000, and the number of cooperative member households will account for about 30 percent of the total number of farm households.

    In the inland rural areas of Yunnan Province, 12,000 agricultural production cooperatives composed of single ethnic minorities and agricultural production cooperatives composed of multiple ethnic groups have been established. About 300,000 farmers of all ethnic groups have joined these agricultural production cooperatives. The newly built cooperatives in mountainous areas are currently actively transitioning to autumn production, and many townships in mountainous areas have carried out comprehensive planning for agricultural cooperativization and production.

    In the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, more than 6,600 mutual aid teams have applied to establish agricultural production cooperatives. Most of these mutual aid teams applying to establish cooperatives are year-round mutual aid teams, and some are joint mutual aid teams. These mutual aid teams have a high enthusiasm for establishing cooperatives, and some joint mutual aid teams have collectively engaged in sideline production.

    A new upsurge in the agricultural cooperativization movement in the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province has begun to arrive. At present, more than 40 percent of farmers (including the original cooperatives) who account for the total number of farmers are actively requesting to run cooperatives, and various places are focusing on comprehensive planning. In order to meet the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement, each county (city, autonomous county) has also begun to train a large number of backbone members of newly built cooperatives since the beginning of October.

    浙江省到十月二十八日止，全省建立的新社达二万五千七百多个，加上老社吸收的新社员，新入社的农户共有七十五万多户。现在，全省连同原有的社在内，共有六万三千二百多个社，新老社员共有一百六十三万多户，占全省农户总数的百分之三十三。为了研究全省农业合作化运动的全面情况，中共浙江省委员会在十月下旬召开了地委书记会议。会议决定在各级党委和全体干部中，再一次组织学习毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议。会议要求各级党委总结检查前一阶段工作，并且研究在建社和整社中如何提高质量问题。
    福建全省到十月底已经建立和搭好架子的新社共有二万多个，一万九千多个老社也吸收了大批新社员。全省入社农户已由八月底的四十二万多户增加到一百一十万户左右，约占全省农户总数的百分之四十，超过中共福建省委员会原订今冬明春发展计划百分之十以上。目前，各地农业合作化运动高潮还在继续上涨中。
    河南省的农业合作化运动已进入高潮。到十月底，全省已经建成或即将建成的第一批新社共有六万九千多个，加上原有的社，全省农业生产合作社共达十一万三千一百多个，入社农户共有三百五十二万八千九百多户，占全省农户总数的百分之三十六点六六。河南省农业合作化高潮去冬就已在部分地区出现。今年九月以后，全省各地普遍召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议，认真学习毛主席关于农业合作化问题的指示，会后，各地都认真贯彻执行了毛主席的指示，促进了农业合作化的发展，到十月中旬，全省便到处出现了农业合作化高潮。
    广西省农业合作化运动也逐渐形成高潮，到十一月三日止，全省已经建成和正在建立的新社有四万多个，加上原有的一万五千多个老社，全省已有五万五千多个农业生产合作社。据初步统计，报名入社的农户已达一百二十多万户，接近完成中共广西省委员会所订的今冬明春吸收农民入社的指标。
    内蒙古自治区目前有七千多个互助组正在申请转社。全区已建立一千五百七十二个新社，入社农户达三万多户。十月二十六日，中共内蒙古自治区委员会一部分委员又率领从自治区一级机关、团体抽调的各族干部一千多人，分赴各盟农村，在分批进行粮食“三定”到户工作的基础上发展农业生产合作社。到明年春耕开始前，全区农业生产合作社将发展到一万一千个，入社农户将占农户总数的百分之三十左右。
    云南省内地农村已建立了单一少数民族组成的农业生产合作社和多民族联合组成的农业生产合作社一万二千个，参加这些农业生产合作社的各族农民约有三十万户。山区新建的社目前正在积极转入秋季生产，不少山区的乡已进行了农业合作化和生产的全面规划。
    新疆维吾尔自治区已有六千六百多个互助组申请建立农业生产合作社。这些申请建社的互助组，绝大部分都是常年互助组，一部分是互助联组，这些互助组要求建社的情绪很高，有些互助联组已集体进行副业生产。
    青海省农业区农业合作化运动的新的高潮已经开始到来。目前已有占总农户百分之四十以上（包括原有社在内）的农民积极要求办社，各地正在重点进行全面规划。为了迎接农业合作化运动的高潮，各县（市、自治县）并从十月初旬开始大批训练新建社的骨干分子。
