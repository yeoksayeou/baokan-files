　　A Fiancée's Letter
　　The Ji-Er Railway, connecting China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, is about to open for through transport. Hundreds of railway workers from all over the country have gathered at the Jining Transportation Branch of the Taiyuan Railway Administration under the Ministry of Railways. In November, they went to large and small stations along the railway, heading to their new posts. Although the wind and sand are heavy in this area and the climate is very cold, everyone is in high spirits. Because they know the principle that "the Ji-Er Railway is a socialist road of peace, friendship, happiness, and prosperity, capable of accelerating our country's industrialization"; "the more difficult the place, the more glorious it is to go there." Many employees, such as car inspector Cao Zhiguo, often receive enthusiastic letters from their loved ones, encouraging them to work steadily in the grasslands.
　　At this time, Zhao Futian, from the locomotive section, received a different kind of letter from his fiancée far away. She said that she was unwilling to come to the Ji-Er line to "endure hardship" and advised him to "find someone else." Zhao Futian was in pain. However, he did not waver because of this and continued to work on the Ji-Er line.
　　We believe that Zhao Futian's pain will soon disappear, because he will soon understand that this kind of backward, dragging-down "love" is by no means true and happy love!

　　未婚妻的来信
    联结中、苏、蒙三国的集二铁路快要通车联运了。来自全国各地的几百名铁路职工已经集中在铁道部太原铁路管理局集宁运输分局。在十一月份，他们纷纷开到铁路沿线大小车站，走向了新的工作岗位。虽然这一带风砂很大，气候很冷，可是，大家的劲头很足。因为他们知道“集二路是一条和平友谊、幸福繁荣、能够加速我国工业化的社会主义大路”；“哪儿越艰苦，到哪儿就越光荣”的道理。检车工曹志国等许多职工经常收到爱人写的热情的信件，鼓励他们在草原地带安心地工作。
    就在这时候，机务段的赵福田却接到远方未婚妻的另外一种来信。说是她不愿来集二线“吃苦”，劝他“另找对象”。赵福田痛苦了。可是他并不因此动摇，仍然在集二线上坚持工作。
    我们相信，赵福田的痛苦很快会消失的，因为他马上会懂得：像这种落后的扯后腿的“爱情”决不是真正的幸福的爱情！
