　　Wuhan has made a preliminary overall plan for the socialist transformation of private commerce.
    The preliminary plan stipulates that within the period of the First Five-Year Plan, private commercial enterprises in the city covering forty-four trades will implement industry-wide joint state-private ownership or be directly transformed into state-owned enterprises. Upon completion of this plan, over 40% of the seated merchants in the city will be transformed into state capitalist economies under joint state-private ownership. The preliminary plan also decides that the existing state-owned companies will directly lead the relevant joint state-private stores. At the same time, the establishment of a Second Commercial Bureau is being prepared to strengthen the leadership of the socialist transformation of private commerce. Each district and each state-owned commercial department should, in order, assist the larger seated merchants in each industry to establish business management systems, improve trade union organizations, strengthen the supervisory role of shop assistants, initially adjust extremely unreasonable wages, and develop plans for asset liquidation, personnel arrangements, and commercial adjustments, to prepare for industry-wide joint state-private ownership. Currently, for smaller private industries and shops that do not yet meet the conditions for joint state-private ownership, vigorous efforts should be made to develop agency sales and distribution businesses to create conditions for industry-wide joint state-private ownership in the future.
    The socialist transformation of private commerce in Wuhan has achieved great success in recent years. The last batch of wholesalers in the city was transformed in April of this year. Among retail seated merchants, twenty-five larger industries have also been purchasing goods according to plans approved by state-owned companies, of which thirteen industries have all been developed into agency stores and distribution stores of state-owned companies. A total of more than 5,400 agency sales, distribution, and wholesale purchase households have been developed in the city, accounting for 42.91% of the total number of private seated merchants in the city. These stores have all initially established democratic management and business management systems, improved business styles and service attitudes, laying the foundation for further socialist transformation. Currently, seated merchants in Wuhan engaged in the silk fabric, Western medicine, and Hunan embroidery industries have been approved by the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee and are undergoing industry-wide joint state-private ownership. In addition, preparations are underway to transform private grain agency stores into state-owned grain store retail departments.

　　武汉市对私营商业的改造初步作出了全面规划
    武汉市对私营商业的社会主义改造已经初步作出了全面规划。
    初步规划中决定在第一个五年计划期内，全市将有四十四个行业的私营商业实行全行业的公私合营或直接转为国营。完成这个计划，全市将有百分之四十以上的座商改造成公私合营的国家资本主义经济。初步规划中还决定由原有各国营公司直接领导各有关的公私合营商店，同时还准备成立第二商业局，以加强对私营商业社会主义改造工作的领导。各区、各国营商业部门要按次序帮助各行业较大的座商建立业务管理制度，健全工会组织，加强店员监督作用，初步调整极不合理的工资，并作出资产清理、人员安排、商业调整的计划，为全行业公私合营做好准备工作。目前对尚不够公私合营条件的较小的私营行业和店户，要积极发展经销、代销业务，为将来全行业公私合营创造条件。
    武汉市私营商业的社会主义改造工作几年来有很大成绩。全市最后的一批批发商已经在今年四月间进行了改造。在零售座商中，也有二十五个较大的行业按照国营公司批准的计划进货，其中有十三个行业已经全部发展为国营公司的代销店和经销店。全市共发展了代销、经销和批购户有五千四百多户，占全市私营座商总户数百分之四十二点九一。这些商店都初步建立了民主管理和业务管理制度，改进了经营作风和服务态度，为进一步进行社会主义改造打下了基础。现在武汉市经营绸布、西药、湘绣等三个行业的座商，已经由武汉市人民委员会批准，正在进行全行业公私合营工作。另外还正在筹备将私营粮食代销店转为国营粮店门市部。
