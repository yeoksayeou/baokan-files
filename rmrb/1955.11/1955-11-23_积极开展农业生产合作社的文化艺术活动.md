    Actively Carry Out Cultural and Artistic Activities in Agricultural Production Cooperatives
	Liang Ruhai

    In our vast countryside, the high tide of cooperative social reform has arrived. All our work in rural areas must serve this large-scale social reform. Cultural and artistic work is no exception.

    Rural cultural and artistic work has greatly developed and played a significant role in recent years. However, it must also be admitted that rural cultural and artistic work lags far behind the agricultural cooperativization movement. As tens of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives emerge batch after batch, the material and cultural living standards of farmers will inevitably gradually improve, and they will inevitably make new demands on cultural and artistic life. Therefore, the focus of rural cultural and artistic work must actively and gradually shift to agricultural production cooperatives (first those with better conditions, a solid foundation, and more core members), using agricultural production cooperatives as units to establish rural clubs and other artistic organizations, and further carry out various rural cultural and artistic activities.

    With the development of the rural cooperativization movement and the changes in rural modes of production and ways of life, it is required that artistic activities not only pay more attention to ideological content with socialist educational significance, but also adapt to the new situation in terms of organizational forms and activity methods. The rural cultural and artistic organizations originally established with a township or village as a unit have undergone great changes with the development of the cooperativization movement. The specific manifestation of this change is that many amateur artistic organizations have transformed into a part of agricultural production cooperatives, and many have fallen into stagnation or semi-stagnation. The reason for this phenomenon is very obvious: the consciousness and organization of farmers have gradually increased in the process of cooperativization, and more and more people are participating in increasingly organized production organizations. At this time, cultural and artistic activity organizations based on individual labor cannot but conflict with production organizations, affecting the development of activities. For example, the rural theater troupe in Shisi Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, originally did well and was a third-class model theater troupe in Lushan County, but after the township established four agricultural production cooperatives in 1954, many members of the troupe were unable to participate in activities according to the original activity methods of the troupe, and the troupe quickly fell into stagnation. Therefore, carrying out amateur artistic activities with agricultural production cooperatives as units has become an inevitable trend in rural artistic work.

    Naturally, not every agricultural production cooperative can establish a club all at once. It requires some necessary conditions. However, it is entirely possible for agricultural production cooperatives to gradually establish various artistic organizations in a planned way based on the needs of the members and the conditions for carrying out activities, such as music groups, folk art groups, dance groups, drama groups, blackboard newspaper groups, and book groups, to attract farmers around each group. In these activities, the cooperatives can gradually improve these artistic organizations, cultivate the backbone of artistic activities, enrich the content of activities, and prepare conditions for the establishment of a unified club.

    The guiding principles and methods for carrying out artistic activities in agricultural production cooperatives must be in accordance with the characteristics and laws of production in agricultural production cooperatives. Each cooperative implements division of labor and specialized production and contracting production to households to varying degrees, so a production team is often an independent production unit. In the same production team, labor conditions, labor methods, working hours, meeting life, etc., are roughly the same; but different production teams often have great differences, and people's work and rest times are inconsistent, making it difficult to get together. Therefore, rural clubs cannot all be like urban clubs or cultural palaces, with a few rooms, some decorations and equipment, and use this fixed place to attract the masses to participate in artistic activities; moreover, there is not much housing in rural areas now, and equipment and conditions are also difficult. This requires carrying out cultural and artistic activities in a decentralized manner, going deep into the production teams, and using breaks between work, before and after meetings, and other spare time to carry out a variety of cultural and artistic activities. This method should be the initial method for carrying out artistic activities in agricultural production cooperatives, which is easy to regularize, can be widely promoted, and can closely combine production and the ideological conditions of the peasant masses. Agricultural production cooperatives in twenty counties including Xindeng, Yuqian, and Pingyang in Zhejiang Province have established more than 700 rural clubs, which have played a significant role in enriching the cultural life of the members and improving their production enthusiasm. The Sanqiao Township Third Agricultural Production Cooperative Club in Xianju County introduced advanced examples of farmers in neighboring areas planting three crops a year on the blackboard newspaper. The entire cooperative not only completed 65 mu of production tasks, but also promoted the planting of 102 mu of three crops a year in the entire village.

    Establishing rural artistic organizations with agricultural production cooperatives as units can ensure the strengthening of leadership, thereby ensuring that rural artistic activities advance along a healthy path. At present, some rural clubs and rural theater troupes still have phenomena such as impure composition, unclear direction, blind development towards professionalization in violation of amateur principles, and forced apportionment to the masses in violation of voluntary principles. The main reason is the lack of leadership. If amateur artistic organizations are incorporated into the normal track of cooperatives, receive regular and specific leadership from the Party and administration of the cooperatives, and have a fixed source of funding, the above problems will be easily solved; at the same time, problems such as hindering production due to performance activities and conflicting with production will also be easily resolved reasonably. For example, the Party branch of the Gecun Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shahe County, Hebei Province, often discusses the work of the club at branch committee meetings, and conducts political and ideological education on the activists of the club through more than a dozen Party members who participate in club activities; all twenty-six members of the Communist Youth League in the village participate in the work and activities of the club together, and find the best way to connect with the masses and promote work. As the Party branch secretary of this cooperative said: "With the club, the members of the Communist Youth League have also become smarter." The rural theater troupe in Guowangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, often conflicted with production in the past. After transferring to the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative, the leadership was strengthened, and the person in charge of the troupe also recognized the mistakes of the past; now, this troupe has become a component of the agricultural production cooperative, performing collectively during slack farming seasons or festivals. Usually, dozens of actors are divided into five artistic groups according to five production teams, and they sing small programs to the farmers at any time and anywhere during production gaps. In this way, its activities are more in line with production and tend to be normalized.

    When carrying out artistic activities in agricultural production cooperatives, we often encounter ideological obstacles from two aspects: On the one hand, some grassroots leaders (including staff of cultural centers and stations) believe that it is easier to carry out artistic activities in individual households or mutual aid groups, and when the gongs and drums are struck, the audience will naturally gather around; it is more difficult to carry out activities in cooperatives. Why? It is said that cooperatives are busy with production and activities will delay production. This concern is due to the fact that they neither recognize the great role of rural artistic activities in coordinating and promoting the cooperativization movement, conducting socialist and patriotic ideological education among the peasant masses, and inspiring their production enthusiasm, nor do they recognize that the organizational nature of cooperative production activities is precisely a favorable condition for carrying out artistic activities in cooperatives. The rural club of the Shangsuan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinning County, Yunnan Province, with the support of the cooperative's leadership, rehearsed 18 artistic programs in four artistic groups in April and May this year, and carried out activities such as reading and playing phonographs in 16 production teams; in the intense rice transplanting work, small artistic activities such as singing ditties and folk songs were widely carried out, which not only did not delay production, but greatly stimulated labor enthusiasm.

    The other obstacle comes from some members of the community. Some young people are obsessed with artistic activities, do not pay attention to good production, put the position of artistic activities above production, do not respect the leadership of the community, and even confront the leadership; some middle-aged and elderly people believe that artistic activities must hinder production, cannot stand the young people's ways, and do not actively support the artistic activities in the community, or even passively resist. In response to this situation, on the one hand, it is necessary to emphasize production first, and that everything is subordinate to production, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to explain to those middle-aged and elderly members the positive role of carrying out artistic activities in production. When organizing and arranging activities, we should also take care of the hobbies of middle-aged and elderly farmers. When the Jinxing Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative first started artistic activities, some elderly people could not stand the young people singing and dancing. The director of the cooperative, Li Shunda, explained the benefits of carrying out artistic activities to everyone, and encouraged everyone to do a good job in artistic activities, and develop cultural and entertainment habits like Soviet collective farmers. Now, each production team in the cooperative has an artistic group, and hundreds of people have participated in the activities of the artistic group. They have learned many songs and dances, and performed three dramas last year; every day during the labor rest time, the members of the artistic group tell fast-talking stories, tell stories, and tell drum words to the members of the community. The community arranges the 5th, 15th, and 25th of each month as days for carrying out larger-scale artistic activities, so that everyone, regardless of age or gender, participates in artistic activities.

    The "Draft Model Articles of Association of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" stipulates: "Cooperatives should carry out cultural, entertainment, and sports activities in a planned way to improve the cultural living standards of members." This is fully in line with the current actual situation of agricultural production cooperatives and the urgent needs of the members. In the ever-developing agricultural cooperativization movement, rural artistic activities will inevitably achieve greater development. This requires the cultural leadership departments and agricultural production cooperatives in various places to actively strengthen the leadership of amateur artistic activities, so that it effectively serves the agricultural cooperativization cause.

### 积极开展农业生产合作社的文化艺术活动

    积极开展农业生产合作社的文化艺术活动
　　梁汝怀
    在我们的幅员广阔的农村里，合作化的社会改革的高潮已经到来。我们在农村的一切工作，都要为这个大规模的社会改革服务。文化艺术工作，也决不例外。
    农村的文化艺术工作，在近几年来，是有很大的发展、并且起了很大的作用的。但是，也应该承认，农村的文化艺术工作是远远落后于农业合作化运动的。当数以万计的农业生产合作社一批一批地出现的时候，农民的物质文化生活水平必然逐步提高，必然要对文化艺术生活不断提出新的要求。因此，农村文艺工作的重点，必须积极地、逐步地转向农业生产合作社（首先是条件较好、基础较厚、骨干较多的社），以农业生产合作社为单位，来建立农村俱乐部等文艺组织，进一步开展农村的各种文化艺术活动。
    随着农村合作化运动的发展和农村的生产方式、生活方式的变化，就要求文艺活动不仅要更多地注意有社会主义教育意义的思想内容，而且在组织形式和活动方式上，也要适应新的情况。原来以一个乡、一个村为单位建立的农村文化艺术组织，随着合作化运动的发展，早已起了很大的变化。这种变化的具体表现是：不少的业余文艺组织转变为农业生产合作社内的一部分，也有不少陷入了停顿或者半停顿状态。产生这种现象的原因是很显然的：农民的自觉性和组织性在合作化的过程中逐步提高，越来越多的人参加到组织性越来越高的生产组织中去，原来以个体劳动为基础的文化艺术活动组织，到这时候，便不能不跟生产组织发生矛盾，影响活动的开展。例如河南省鲁山县释寺乡的农村剧团，原来搞得不错，是鲁山县的三等模范剧团，但在一九五四年乡里成立四个农业生产合作社以后，剧团的许多成员无法按照剧团原来的活动方式参加活动，这样，剧团很快就陷于停顿。所以，以农业生产合作社为单位开展业余文艺活动，已经成为农村文艺工作的必然趋势。
    自然，并不是每一个农业生产合作社都能一下子建立一个俱乐部的。它需要一些必要的条件。但是，农业生产合作社有计划地根据社员的需要和开展活动的条件，逐步建立各种文艺组织，例如音乐组、曲艺组、舞蹈组、戏剧组、墙报组、图书组等，把农民吸引在各个组的周围，是完全可以做到的。在这些活动中，合作社可以逐渐健全这些文艺组织，培养文艺活动的骨干，充实活动的内容，为建立一个统一的俱乐部准备好条件。
    在农业生产合作社开展文艺活动的方针和方式，就是必须服从农业生产合作社生产的特点和规律。每个合作社都在不同程度上实行分工分业和包工包产，这样，一个生产队往往就是一个独立的生产单位。在同一个生产队里，劳动条件、劳动方式、作业时间、会议生活等等，大致相同；但不同的生产队就往往有很大的区别，人们作息的时间不一致，凑不到一起。所以，农村俱乐部就不可能都像城市里的俱乐部或文化宫那样，有几间房子，有些装璜和设备，以这个固定场所来吸引群众参加文艺活动；而且现在农村里房屋也并不宽裕，设备、条件也有困难。这就要求把文化艺术活动分散地深入到生产队里去进行，以生产队为单位，利用工间休息、会议前后和其他业余时间，进行多种多样的文化艺术活动。这种方式，应该是农业生产合作社中开展文艺活动的初步方式，容易经常化，也能普遍推行，并且能密切地结合生产和农民群众的思想情况。浙江省新登、於潜、平阳等二十个县的农业生产合作社，已经建立了七百多个农村俱乐部，对丰富社员们的文化生活和提高他们的生产热情都起了不少的作用。仙居县三桥乡第三农业生产合作社俱乐部，在黑板报上介绍了邻区农民种植三熟作物的先进事例，全社不但完成了六十五亩的生产任务，还推动全村种植三熟作物一百零二亩。
    以农业生产合作社为单位来建立农村文艺组织，能够保证领导的加强，从而保证农村文艺活动沿着健康的道路前进。目前还有些农村俱乐部和农村剧团还有成份不纯、方向不明、违反业余原则盲目向职业化发展、违反自愿原则向群众强迫摊派等等现象。主要的原因就是缺乏领导。业余文艺组织如果纳入合作社的正常轨道，得到合作社党和行政上的经常的、具体的领导，有固定的经费来源，上面这些问题就容易解决；同时，由于演出活动而妨碍生产、同生产闹对立等等问题，也容易得到合理的解决。例如河北省沙河县葛村农业生产合作社的党支部，经常在支委会的会议上讨论俱乐部的工作，通过参加俱乐部活动的十几个党员，对俱乐部的活动分子进行政治思想教育；全村二十六个青年团员一齐参加俱乐部的工作和活动，找到了联系群众、推动工作的最好的方式。就像这个社的党支部书记说的：“有了俱乐部，青年团员也变得聪明一些了。”河南省安阳县郭王度村的农村剧团，原来常常同生产闹对立，转入先锋农业生产合作社以后，加强了领导，剧团的负责人也认识了过去的错误；现在，这个剧团就成为农业生产合作社的一个组成部分，在农闲或节日进行集中演出，平时就把几十个演员按五个生产队分成五个文艺小组，利用生产空隙随时随地给农民演唱小型节目。这样，它的活动也就更能配合生产、趋向正常化了。
    在农业生产合作社开展文艺活动的时候，往往会遇到来自两方面的思想障碍：一方面是基层领导工作人员（包括文化馆、站辅导的工作人员），他们认为在单干户或互助组中开展文艺活动比较容易，锣鼓一敲，观众就自然而然地围拢来了；在合作社开展就比较难。为什么呢？据说是合作社生产忙，搞活动要耽误生产。这种顾虑，是由于他们既没有认识到农村文艺活动在配合和推动合作化运动、向农民群众进行社会主义和爱国主义思想教育、鼓舞他们生产情绪等方面的巨大作用，也没有认识到合作社生产活动的组织性，恰恰是在合作社内开展文艺活动的有利条件。云南省晋宁县上蒜农业生产合作社的农村俱乐部，由于社的领导的支持，在今年四、五两月中，四个文艺组排练了十八个文艺节目，在十六个生产小组内开展了读书和放留声机等活动；在紧张的栽秧工作中，广泛地开展唱小调、唱山歌等小型的文艺活动，不仅没有耽误生产，反而大大地激发了劳动热情。
    另一方面的障碍，来自一部分社员群众。有些青年醉心于文艺活动，不注意好好生产，把文艺活动的位置放在生产以上，不尊重社的领导，甚至同领导对立；有些中年和老年人认为文艺活动一定妨碍生产，看不惯年青人的一套，对社里的文艺活动不积极支持，甚至消极抵制。对这种情况，一方面需要强调生产第一，一切服从生产，另方面也要向那些中年老年的社员说清楚开展文艺活动对生产的积极作用。在组织和安排活动的时候，也应该照顾中年、老年农民的爱好。金星农林畜牧生产合作社刚开始搞文艺活动，有些老年人看不惯小伙子们唱歌跳舞，社长李顺达就向大家讲明开展文艺活动的好处，鼓励大家搞好文艺活动，养成像苏联集体农民那样的文化娱乐习惯。现在，全社每个生产队都有一个文艺组，已经有上百人参加文艺组的活动，学会了很多歌曲和舞蹈，去年还演出过三个戏；每天在劳动休息时间，文艺组组员们就向社员说快板、讲故事、说鼓词，社里安排每月初五、十五、二十五三天是进行较大规模文艺活动的日子，这样，不分老少男女，都来参加文艺活动了。
    “农业生产合作社示范章程草案”里规定：“合作社应该有计划地开展文化、娱乐和体育的活动，提高社员的文化生活水平。”这是完全符合农业生产合作社当前的实际情况和社员群众的迫切需要的。在日益发展的农业合作化运动中，农村文艺活动必然获得更大的发展。这就要求各地文化领导部门和农业生产合作社积极地加强对业余文艺活动的领导，使它有效地为农业合作化事业服务。
