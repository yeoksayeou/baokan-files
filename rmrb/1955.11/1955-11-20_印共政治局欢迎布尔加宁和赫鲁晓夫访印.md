Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 18th - The Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a statement on the 17th, saying that the Communist Party of India, together with all the people of India and the Indian government, wholeheartedly welcomes the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and the member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, to visit India at the invitation of Prime Minister Nehru.

　　The statement pointed out that the Soviet Union's foreign policy has always been guided by a great idea of Lenin's, that is, countries with different social systems and political systems can coexist peacefully. The statement continued: "We proudly recall that India has also adopted a similar attitude to the Soviet Union on many current issues, such as the issue of accepting China into the United Nations, the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen bombs, and the issue of disarmament, and so on."

　　The statement concluded: "The reason why this is possible is because both of our countries have an ardent desire to ease international tensions and strive for world peace. All of this was concretely manifested in this year's Nehru-Bulganin statement. This statement is a further concretization of the principle of peaceful coexistence."

　　印共政治局欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访印
    新华社新德里十八日电　印度共产党中央委员会政治局十七日发表声明说，印度共产党同印度全体人民和印度政府一起，衷心地欢迎苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁、苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫应尼赫鲁总理的邀请到印度访问。
    声明指出，苏联的外交政策一向是以列宁的一个伟大思想为指针的，那就是具有不同社会制度和政治制度的国家可以和平共处。声明接着说：“我们骄傲地回顾印度在目前的许多问题上也采取了同苏联类似的态度，例如在接受中国进入联合国的问题、禁止原子弹和氢弹的问题和裁军问题等等问题上。”
    声明最后说：“所以能够这样，是因为我们两国都具有缓和国际紧张局势和争取世界和平的热烈愿望。这一切在今年的尼赫鲁—布尔加宁声明中得到了具体的表现。这项声明是和平共处的原则的进一步具体化。”
