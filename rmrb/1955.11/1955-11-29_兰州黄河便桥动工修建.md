Construction Begins on Lanzhou Yellow River Pontoon Bridge

    Construction has begun on the Lanzhou Yellow River pontoon bridge, which will connect the Lanzhou industrial area and building material production sites. Currently, crane operators are erecting antennas on the river surface, and carpenters are nailing wooden cages. Quarrying work is also proceeding intensively.

    This bridge is being built using steel beams erected on a wooden cage foundation. The bridge body will be approximately fifty meters longer than the Lanzhou Yellow River Iron Bridge and will have ice breakers. When ice floes hit the ice breakers, they will be broken into pieces and flow through the bridge openings. This will reduce the impact of the ice on the bridge, ensuring the bridge's safety and extending its lifespan. After the bridge is completed, the transportation distance for building materials will be shortened by more than 40 kilometers compared to using the Yellow River Iron Bridge.

### 兰州黄河便桥动工修建

　　兰州黄河便桥动工修建
    联结兰州工业区和建筑材料产地的兰州黄河便桥已经动工修建。目前起重工人正在河面上架设天线，木工正在钉制木笼。采石工作也在紧张进行。
    这座桥是采用在木笼基础上架钢梁的办法建筑的。桥身将较兰州黄河铁桥长约五十公尺，并且设有破冰体，冰凌碰着破冰体，即裂成碎块，由桥孔流过，这样可以减少冰凌对桥的冲击力量，保证桥的安全和延长桥的寿命。这座桥建成后，建筑材料的运输里程，将比通过黄河铁桥缩短四十多公里。
