Xinhua News Agency, 1st - According to a France-Presse Hong Kong dispatch: Maryknoll, an American who committed crimes in China and was recently released early and deported according to a decision by a Chinese court, admitted to reporters upon arriving in Hong Kong on October 31 that she had committed crimes in China that harmed the interests of the Chinese people.

Maryknoll said: She was arrested because she was engaged in "activities that violated the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people." She said: "I was very opposed to the current regime at the time, and I passed on what I saw and heard as intelligence to American diplomatic agencies. Therefore, the Chinese government was fully justified in arresting me." "The Chinese government (at the time of the arrest) had a complete grasp of the facts."

Maryknoll said: She confessed to the crimes she committed during her imprisonment, "completely voluntarily." She said that she "received completely fair treatment" in prison. She also said, "The policy of the Chinese government is to make a person in prison realize what he has done that is harmful to the broad masses of the people and unfavorable to the people of the world. This is an education policy, a transformation policy."

Maryknoll said: "My view today is that a true American is one who adheres to true peace, not one who relies on a policy of strength. He is also one who adheres to true peaceful life and equality—like the peaceful life and equality that China is building today." "No matter what work I do in the future, I hope to work in this direction."

Maryknoll said: "New China is building a decent life for everyone today. It is moving forward confidently and successfully on the road to socialism." She said: She hopes to return to the United States as soon as possible and "tell the American people" her feelings, "because the ruling group has distorted the true nature of communism to them."

    被我驱逐出境的美国人
    密含瑞在香港对记者发表谈话
    新华社一日讯　据法新社香港消息：最近根据中国法院的决定被提前释放和驱逐出境的在中国犯法的美国人密含瑞在十月三十一日到达香港对记者发表谈话时承认，她在中国犯有危害中国人民利益的罪行。
    密含瑞说：她被逮捕的原因是由于她从事“违反中国人民的革命事业的活动”。她说：“我当时非常反对现政权，我把我所看到的和听到的事情作为情报传给美国的外交机构。因此，中国政府逮捕我是完全有理由的。”“中国政府（在逮捕时）完全掌握了事实”。
    密含瑞说：她在被监禁期间坦白了她所犯的罪行，“这完全出于自愿”。她说，她在监狱中“受到的待遇完全公正”。她又说，“中国政府的政策就是叫一个在监狱中的人认识到他做了什么有害于广大人民的事情和不利于世界人民的事情。这是一种教育政策，一种改造政策。”
    密含瑞说：“我今天的看法是：一个真正的美国人就是坚持真正的和平的人，而不是一个依仗实力政策的人。他还是一个坚持真正的和平生活和平等——就像中国今天正在建设的那种和平生活和平等——的人。不论我以后从事什么工作，我希望朝着这个方向努力。”
    密含瑞说：“新中国今天正在为每一个人建立像样的生活。它正满怀信心、成功地在社会主义道路上迈进。”她说：她希望尽快回到美国，把她的感受“告诉美国人民，因为统治集团向他们歪曲报道共产主义的真实性质”。
