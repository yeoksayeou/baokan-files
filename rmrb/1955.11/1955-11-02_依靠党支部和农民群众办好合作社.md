Rely on Party Branches and Peasants to Run Cooperatives Well
Wang Zizhen, Secretary of the Xinyang County Party Committee, Henan Province

Last winter, some townships in Xinyang County, Henan Province, experienced a high tide in the agricultural cooperation movement. After a series of work this year, especially after conveying Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the socialist consciousness of cadres and the masses has improved, and the enthusiasm of the broad masses for joining and transferring to cooperatives has become even higher. According to a survey of Fuhe and Suhe townships, farmers who actively requested to join cooperatives accounted for 73 percent of the total number of farm households. Chen Lianwen, a poor peasant from Wohu Township, said: "Chairman Mao is as close to the peasants as a mother is to her son. I will listen to Chairman Mao and resolutely join the cooperative." Many farmers told district and township cadres: "If you don't approve our transfer to cooperatives this time, Chairman Mao will criticize you!" At present, 264 old cooperatives throughout the county are being consolidated, and hundreds of new cooperatives are being prepared or have been established.

Under this new situation, rural work cadres have also become more active. Many comrades have examined their right-leaning conservative thinking and deeply feel that they have fallen behind the masses. Although some comrades have seen that a new high tide in the cooperative movement has indeed arrived, they worry all day long about whether it is feasible to run so many agricultural cooperatives. Under these circumstances, it is no longer possible to rely solely on a few cadres to run and establish cooperatives. It is necessary to boldly mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and transform the Party's policies into the conscious actions of the broad masses, so as to ensure the smooth and healthy development of the entire agricultural cooperation movement. Therefore, implementing the working method of the mass line in our work has a particularly important significance for Party organizations.

In implementing the working method of the mass line, we must first and foremost rely on the township Party branches and the broad masses of activists to unite and lead the masses forward. Of the 242 township Party branches in Xinyang County, 209 currently have experience in running cooperatives, and most of these branches have very rich experience. For example, the Xuetang Township branch led the masses to consolidate the Huangwan cooperative, which had 24 households, and also led the masses to establish four new cooperatives, including Longkan and Mazhuang, and also set up two "cooperative frameworks." Huangwan cooperative increased grain production by 13,000 jin this year, implemented a year-round contract labor system in production management, and the thinking of the members is gradually being consolidated. The four newly established cooperatives basically conform to class policies and the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. After more than a year of practical training, five out of ten Party members now have the ability to run cooperatives independently. Thirty-nine activists have emerged in the movement, and some of these activists have also learned how to run cooperatives. For example, poor peasant Cao Ruiye was responsible for building the Wujiabian cooperative. Many Party branches like the Xuetang Township branch have appeared in various districts. Practice has proved that wherever the branch is boldly relied upon, not only has the work been done well, but the combat effectiveness of the branch has also been improved.

Secondly, we must focus on key areas, establish banners, and use the old cooperatives to promote the new ones. Peasants are practical, so in addition to deeply and widely publicizing the Party's policies, we must also run key cooperatives in key townships well and set up examples. The three key townships directly led by the county and district, Xieqiao, Fuhe, and Balicha, and the seven cooperatives, Xiechong, Wohu, and Shibalimiao, have played a significant demonstration role. For example, the Xiechong cooperative has had an excellent impact not only on the masses in its own township but also on the masses within 30 li around it. The masses in Dawang Township often visit the Xiechong cooperative to learn about the experience of running cooperatives. Because these key cooperatives have significantly improved technology and increased production, they have a greater attraction for the surrounding masses. Someone asked Yu Xinrang, a poor peasant from Huangjiawan, why he wanted to join the cooperative. He said: "I heard that the cooperative run by Hu Yushan (secretary of the Xieqiao Township branch) increased rice production by more than 20 shi in the first year, and the members distributed more grain. If he can run it well, we can follow his example." The current shortcomings are that the county and district committees have not done enough to summarize the experience of key townships, especially in helping the branches summarize the experience of running cooperatives. Some comrades who are engaged in key township work in some district committees do not have the confidence and courage to do well, and they request to "move the focus," which is inappropriate. Each district should fix the district's key areas according to the situation, and set up a central township and a central cooperative for each area led by the work team. The cadres who are determined to work on key townships and cooperatives should generally not be transferred. At the same time, the leadership of key branches should be strengthened, experiences should be summarized in a timely manner, and these experiences should be promoted in various forms. Using existing cooperatives as bases to drive the great development of new cooperatives is an important method for us to expand and build cooperatives. One old cooperative in Xindian Township helped mutual aid teams build three new cooperatives. There are also such examples in various districts. If the existing 264 old cooperatives can each lead an average of four, then more than 1,000 new cooperatives can be driven. What a great force this is! There are basically two methods for old cooperatives to lead new cooperatives: one is to organize the masses to visit the old cooperatives, and the cadres of the old cooperatives systematically introduce the experience of the cooperative's production management, distribution, and other aspects to the masses who come to visit. In this way, the masses not only hear but also see the superiority of the cooperative. Most of the townships in the county with old cooperatives organize the masses to visit during the production season, which has played a significant role. For example, Li Zhiguang, a poor peasant from Wohu Township, had a family of two with half a labor force. He was afraid that after joining the cooperative, he would have fewer work points and the grain distributed would not be enough to eat, and he was afraid of not being free to work with everyone. He personally visited Du Zhenxun, a member of the Hewan cooperative. The Du family also has three people with only half a labor force. After joining the cooperative, in addition to the 1.5 shi of rice allocated for the land, the work points earned can also be divided into more than 3.5 shi, for a total of more than 5 shi (420 jin per shi), which is an increase of 5 dou compared to before joining the cooperative. Du Zhenxun also introduced how the cooperative assigned him lighter work, and some heavy work, such as carrying manure and plowing, which had to be done by himself in the past, is now divided according to the strength of the labor force. After the visit, Li Zhiguang's concerns were dispelled, and now he actively requests to join the cooperative. Another method is to organize the heads of old cooperatives and production team leaders to give reports in newly built cooperatives in turn, introducing their experience, but also not concealing the shortcomings of their own cooperatives, in order to arouse the vigilance of the new cooperatives. Most of the old cooperatives in the Lijiazhai District have reported to the new cooperatives several times, and the masses have responded well. Some cooperatives have also adopted methods such as men teaching men and women teaching women. Facts have proved that the method of using old cooperatives as bases to drive new cooperatives is an effective method of educating the masses with typical examples of living people and living events, and it is also the method that the masses are most willing to accept.

The county and district should convene mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences in a timely manner and use the mutual aid and cooperation network to exchange experiences. Xinyang County has held three mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences and one agricultural cooperative rectification representative conference since last winter, and the districts have also held them, all with good results. For example, the mutual aid and cooperation representative conference held in mid-August mainly solved the autumn distribution problem. The representatives attending the meeting reflected: "If it weren't for this meeting, we wouldn't know where to start with the autumn distribution." For example, Ke Shigang, the head of the Huangwan cooperative, said: "The accountant went to the county to attend the meeting and learned the distribution method. After he came back, he formulated the distribution plan." The county and district should generally convene representative conferences before major issues such as the production season, the beginning or end of new cooperatives, and distribution. Make full preparations before the meeting, especially in summarizing typical experiences and studying specific policies. The content of the meeting should be specific, the time should not be too long, and democracy should be promoted to stimulate the enthusiasm of the representatives and gather wisdom.

In one or several townships (one area), the mutual aid and cooperation network should be used well to exchange experiences in a timely manner, with the key townships and central townships as the main body, absorbing three or five surrounding townships to participate in the formation of the mutual aid and cooperation network, and the townships establishing mutual aid and cooperation committees. This mass organization has played a great role in promoting cooperation. For example, the mutual aid and cooperation network of five townships led by Chezhan Township in Dongshuanghe District summarized the experience of the Five-Star Cooperative in solving the difficulty of cattle fodder and the experience of seasonal contract labor this spring, which has greatly promoted the surrounding cooperatives. The activities of the mutual aid and cooperation network generally adopt the method of regular meetings or itinerant teaching. At present, in order to adapt to the new high tide of cooperation, it is even more necessary to systematically use the mutual aid and cooperation network and convene mutual aid and cooperation representative conferences in a timely manner, so as to promote the advancement of the cooperation movement.

In addition, Xinyang County has formed a work team of nearly 100 people, which has been dispatched to various townships to work. The county party committee should strengthen the ideological leadership of the work team, commend the activists in the movement, criticize those in the work team who have individualism and bourgeois ideology, so that this group of work team members gradually become experts in running cooperatives and become the Party's strong force for carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture.

    依靠党支部和农民群众办好合作社
    中共信阳县委书记　王子祯
    河南省信阳县部分乡在去冬就出现了农业合作化运动的高潮，经过今年一系列的工作，特别是最近传达了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，干部和群众的社会主义觉悟都有了提高，广大群众要求入社、转社的热情更加高涨。据付河、苏贺两乡的调查，积极要求入社的农户就占总农户的百分之七十三。卧虎乡贫农陈联文说：“毛主席对农民好像妈妈对儿子一样的亲，我听毛主席的话，坚决入社。”很多农民向区乡干部说：“这次你们再不批准我们转社，毛主席还要批评你们哩！”目前，全县二百六十四个老社正在整顿巩固，几百个新社正在筹备或已经建成。
    在这种新的形势下，农村工作干部也更加积极起来了，很多同志检查了自己的右倾保守思想，深深地感到自己落在群众后面。有一部分同志虽然也看到了合作化运动新高潮确实来到了，但一天到晚忧虑着搞这样多的农业合作社是不是行？在这种情况下，如果只靠少数干部去办社、建社确实已经不能适应形势的需要了，必须放手发动群众，依靠群众，把党的政策变为广大群众的自觉行动，才能使整个农业合作化运动顺利健康地发展。因此，在工作中贯彻实现群众路线的工作方法对于党组织来说，有特别重要的意义。
    在贯彻实现群众路线的工作方法中，首先必须切实依靠乡的党支部和广大积极分子，团结带领群众前进。信阳全县二百四十二个乡的党支部，目前已有办社经验的就有二百零九个，其中大部分支部的经验是很丰富的。如学堂乡支部领导群众整顿巩固了黄湾二十四户的一个老社，又领导群众建成了龙坎、马庄等四个新社，另外还搭起了两个“社架子”。黄湾社今年在农业上增产一万三千斤粮食，生产管理上实行了常年包工制，社员思想日渐巩固起来，新建的四个社基本上符合阶级政策和自愿互利政策。经过一年多的实际锻炼，现在十个党员中有单独办社能力的就有五个，在运动中出现了三十九个积极分子，其中部分积极分子也学会了办社。如贫农曹瑞业负责建好了吴家畈社。类似学堂乡这样的党支部，在各区出现了很多。实践证明，那个地方大胆依靠支部，不但作好了工作，而且提高了支部的战斗力。
    其次，必须搞好重点，树立旗帜，用老社来推动新社。农民是讲实际的，因此，除了深入广泛地宣传党的政策外，还得办好重点乡的重点社，树立榜样。县区直接领导的谢桥、付河、八里岔三个重点乡，谢冲、卧虎、十八里庙等七个社，都起了示范的重大作用。如谢冲社不但对本乡群众，而且对其周围三十里的群众都起了极好的影响，大王乡的群众经常到谢冲社去访问，了解办社经验。由于这些重点社都显著地提高了技术，增加了生产，对周围群众更有巨大的吸引力。有人问黄家湾贫农余新让为什么要入社？他说：“我听说胡玉山（谢桥乡支部书记）办的合作社头一年增产二十多石稻谷，社员都多分了粮食。他能办好，我们也能跟着学。”目前的缺点是县、区委对重点乡经验的总结做得不够，尤其是帮助支部总结办社经验做得不够，有的区委重点乡的工作搞的不很好，至今有些搞重点乡工作的同志还缺乏搞好的信心和勇气，要求“重点搬家”，这是不妥当的。各区应根据情况将区的重点固定下来，按照工作组领导的乡数，每片设立中心乡、中心社。确定搞重点乡社的干部，一般不要调动，同时要加强对重点支部的领导，及时总结经验，运用各种形式推广这些经验。以现有社为阵地去带动新社的大发展，这是我们扩社和建社的重要方法，辛店乡一个老社帮助互助组建成三个新社。各区也有这样的事例。如果现有的二百六十四个老社都能够平均一个带四个的话，即可带动一千多个新社。这是多么大的力量。老社带新社的方法基本上有两种：一是组织群众到老社参观、访问，老社的干部有计划地向来参观的群众介绍社内的生产管理、分配等经验，这样，群众不但听见而且亲眼看见了社的优越性。全县大部分有老社的乡都按照生产季节组织群众参观、访问，起的作用是很大的。如卧虎乡贫农李之光一家二口，半个劳动力，怕入社后劳动工分少，分到的粮食不够吃，怕随大家干活不自由，他亲自访问了河湾社社员杜振训。杜家三个人也只有半个劳动力，入社后除土地分得一石五斗稻外，所挣工分还可分三石五斗多，共收五石多（每石四百二十斤），比入社前增加五斗。杜振训并介绍了社里如何将轻活分给他干，有些重活如担粪、犁耙地等，过去非自己干不可，入社后是根据劳力强弱分工的。李之光参观后，顾虑解除了，现在积极要求入社。另一种方法是组织老社的社长、生产队长，轮流到新建社去作报告，介绍经验，但也不隐瞒自己社的缺点，以引起新社的警惕。李家砦区大部分的老社都先后到新社去报告数次，群众反映良好，有的社还采用了男教男、女教女等办法。事实证明，以老社为阵地去带动新社的办法，是用活人活事典型实例教育群众的有效方法，也是群众最乐于接受的方法。
    县区要适时地召开互助合作代表会，运用互助合作网交流经验。信阳县里从去冬到现在召开了三次互助合作代表会，一次整顿农业合作社代表会，各区也都召开了，效果都很好。如八月中旬召开的一次互助合作代表会主要是解决秋季分配问题。参加会的代表反映：“要不是开这次会，秋季分配还不知道从什么地方着手哩。”如黄湾社社长柯士刚说：“会计去县参加会议，学会了分配办法，他回来后就把分配方案制定好了。”县区召开代表会一般应在生产季节、新建社的开始或结束以及进行分配等重大问题之前。会前作好充分的准备，尤其要做好总结典型经验，研究具体政策等方面的工作。会议内容要突出具体，时间不要太长，并发扬民主，启发代表的积极性，集思广益。
    在一乡或数乡（一片）应很好地运用互助合作网及时交流经验，以重点乡、中心乡为主，吸收周围三、五个乡参加组成互助合作网，乡建立互助合作委员会。这种群众性的组织对推动合作化起了很大作用。如东双河区以车站乡为主组成的五个乡的互助合作网，今春总结了五星社解决牛草困难的经验、季节包工的经验，对周围社推动很大。互助合作网的活动，一般的采用定期会或巡回传授的方法。目前为了适应合作化的新高潮，更必须系统地运用互助合作网，适时地召开互助合作代表会，借以推动合作化运动的前进。
    此外，信阳全县组成近百人的一支工作队，已分赴各乡工作。县委应加强工作队的思想领导，表扬工作队在运动中的积极分子，批评工作队中有个人主义、资产阶级思想的人，使这批工作队员逐渐地变成办社能手，成为党对农业实行社会主义改造的坚强力量。
