　  鸠山组成自由民主党内阁
    新华社二十二日讯　东京消息：日本国会二十二日召开临时会议选举新首相。自由民主党代行委员鸠山一郎以多数票胜过社会党主席铃木茂三郎，继续当选为首相。
    鸠山一郎在二十二日下午宣布组成了包括十九个阁员的自由民主党内阁。原内阁的主要阁员大多留任，他们包括副首相兼外务相重光葵、通商产业相石桥湛山、藏相一万田尚登、农林相河野一郎和经济企划厅长官高碕达之助。小林英三、仓石忠雄、船田中等七名前自由党人被吸收到新内阁来，他们分别担任厚生相、劳动相、防卫厅长官等职务。
    鸠山一郎在组成新内阁后发表谈话说，他要“竭尽全力，实现作过的诺言的政策”，要更进一步推行“和平外交”。鸠山又表示新内阁坚决要求实现修改禁止日本重新武装的现行宪法和改革行政机构等目标。
    日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎在二十二日发表谈话评论新内阁说，新内阁并没有什么新的东西，它只不过是第二次鸠山内阁的延续而已。
    据共同社报道，日本国会临时会议从二十三日起将休会十天，然后在十二月三日前后复会。
