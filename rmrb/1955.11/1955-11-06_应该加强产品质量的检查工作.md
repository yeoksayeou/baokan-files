To the Editor:

    I am a procurement officer at the Jinan Railway Bureau's Materials General Factory. In my daily work, I have found that some factories and mining enterprises do not pay enough attention to product quality inspection, often letting unqualified products leave the factory carelessly, causing returns or losses to the ordering units. For example, not long ago, the steel rails allocated to our factory by the Ministry of Railways were not strictly inspected in each production process and before leaving the factory in the turnout section. As a result, some of them were unusable after being transported to the construction site, resulting in losses due to sending personnel on business trips for repairs and round-trip transportation. At the same time, four twelve-and-a-half-meter steel rails were scrapped because they did not meet the specifications. Many of the turnouts produced by the Shanhaiguan Bridge Factory were also unusable, causing not only rework and repairs but also affecting the construction of the project. For example, our factory processed a batch of flat fishplates at the Jinan No. 2 Machine Tool Factory. Because the inspection was not thorough during the production process, 509 defective pieces and 62 scrap pieces were produced, resulting in a loss of more than 2,000 yuan. This situation should be changed. I suggest that industrial enterprises in various regions strengthen quality inspection during each production process and when products leave the factory to ensure that product quality fully meets the standards, in order to avoid various unnecessary losses.

    应该加强产品质量的检查工作编辑同志：
    我是济南铁路管理局材料总厂的采购员。在日常工作中，我发现目前有些厂矿生产单位很不注意对产品质量的检查，常常使不合格的产品马虎出厂，造成退货或使订货单位遭受损失的现象。例如，不久以前铁道部拨给我厂的钢轨，因为道岔部分在各生产工序和出厂时都检查不严，结果运到工地以后有一部分不合使用，造成派员出差修理和往返运输的损失；同时，还有四根十二公尺半的钢轨因不合规格报废。山海关桥梁工厂出品的道岔也有许多不能使用，不仅造成返工修理，还影响了工程施工。又如，我厂在济南第二机床厂加工一批平直夹板，因为在生产过程中检验不认真，造成五百零九块次品，六十二块废品，损失了两千多元。这种情况是应该改变的。我建议各地工业企业单位加强在各项生产工序中和产品出厂时的质量检验工作，保证产品质量完全合乎标准，以避免各种不应有的损失。
