Xinhua News Agency, 3rd. The experience of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army in achieving large-scale, high-yield cotton production will be promoted in cotton-producing areas across the country. Currently, cotton-producing areas are actively preparing to widely learn and promote this experience next year.

The Ministry of Agriculture recently decided to use six units, including the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan Province, as bases for demonstrative experiments in large-scale, high-yield cotton production next year. The Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan Province has determined to experiment with large-scale, high-yield production on 2,200 mu of land. The Shanghai Farm in Dafeng County, Jiangsu Province, has determined to experiment with large-scale, high-yield production on an area of 20,000 mu. The Linqing Cotton Farm in Shandong Province will use 266 mu, the Yuncheng Agricultural Experiment Station in Shanxi Province will use 200 mu, the Shijiazhuang Agricultural Experiment Station in Hebei Province will use 100 mu, and the Jinghui Agricultural Experiment Station in Shaanxi Province will use 100 mu. These units will adopt a series of cotton planting technology reforms under the direct guidance of cotton production experts sent by the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, based on different conditions, to produce 300 to 600 jin of seed cotton per mu.

Other agricultural science research institutes and agricultural experiment stations in various regions are also preparing to learn from the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps' cotton high-yield experience and will trial planting the Soviet "108-F" cotton variety and 22 other excellent varieties next year.

Relevant departments in cotton-producing areas are currently preparing to vigorously promote the cotton high-yield experience of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps to farmers and help agricultural production cooperatives strive for a bumper cotton harvest, demonstrating to farmers. Shandong Province plans to select 4,000 agricultural production cooperatives, totaling 500,000 mu of cotton fields, for high-yield demonstrations, requiring the average yield of seed cotton per mu to increase from the original 150 jin to 210 jin. Among them, 300 agricultural production cooperatives with 100,000 mu of cotton fields are required to produce an average of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. State-owned farms throughout the province are generally required to produce 300 jin of seed cotton per mu. Shanxi Province plans to take the Yuncheng Farm as the center, selecting 200 agricultural production cooperatives with a total of 200,000 mu of cotton fields for high-yield demonstrations, requiring the average yield of seed cotton per mu to increase from the original 150 jin to 195 jin to 210 jin.

The Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps, with the help and guidance of Soviet expert Titov, learned advanced Soviet cotton planting technology and has been reclaiming land and planting cotton in the Manas River basin for several years, achieving large-scale high yields year after year. This year, more than 80,000 mu of cotton were planted, with an average yield of more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, and the highest yield reached 1,000 jin to more than 1,400 jin. Their high-yield experience mainly involves using Soviet improved varieties, implementing autumn plowing, winter irrigation, rational fertilization, timely sowing, dense planting with full seedlings, timely pruning, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

### 全国将推广新疆部队棉花大面积丰产经验

    全国将推广新疆部队棉花大面积丰产经验
    新华社三日讯　中国人民解放军新疆军区农业生产建设部队棉花大面积丰产的经验，将要在全国各产棉区推广。目前各产棉区正在积极进行在明年广泛学习和推广这个经验的准备工作。
    农业部最近决定明年以河南省安阳棉场等六个单位为基点，进行棉花大面积丰产的示范性试验。河南省安阳棉场已确定在二千二百亩的土地上试验大面积丰产；江苏省大丰县上海农场确定试验大面积丰产的面积是二万亩；山东省临清棉场是二百六十六亩，山西省运城农业试验站是二百亩，河北省石家庄农业试验站是一百亩，陕西省泾惠农业试验站是一百亩，这些单位将根据不同条件分别使每亩棉田产籽棉三百斤到六百斤。各基点为了完成以上的任务，除采用苏联“一○八夫”棉花良种或当地棉花良种外，还将要在新疆军区农业生产建设部队派来的棉花丰产能手的直接指导下，进行一系列的植棉技术改革。
    其他各地农业科学研究所和农业试验站也准备学习新疆军区农业生产建设部队的棉花丰产经验，在明年将试种苏联“一○八夫”棉花良种和其他二十二个优良品种。
    各产棉区的有关部门目前正在准备大力向农民宣传新疆军区农业生产建设部队的棉花丰产经验，并且帮助农业生产合作社争取棉花丰收，向农民示范。山东省计划选择四千个农业生产合作社共五十万亩棉田进行丰产示范，要求平均每亩产籽棉由原有的一百五十斤提高到二百一十斤；其中三百个农业生产合作社的十万亩棉田，要求每亩平均产籽棉三百斤。全省国营农场的棉田普遍要求每亩产籽棉三百斤。山西省计划以运城农场为中心，选择二百个农业生产合作社共二十万亩棉田进行丰产示范，要求平均每亩产籽棉由原有的一百五十斤提高到一百九十五斤到二百一十斤。
    新疆军区农业生产建设部队在苏联专家提托夫的帮助和指导下，学习苏联先进植棉技术，几年来在玛纳斯河流域垦区开荒植棉，连年获得大面积丰产。今年植棉八万多亩，平均每亩产籽棉四百斤以上，最高的产一千斤到一千四百多斤。他们的丰产经验主要是采用苏联良种，实行秋耕、冬灌，合理施肥，及时播种，密植全苗，适时整枝和防治病虫害。
