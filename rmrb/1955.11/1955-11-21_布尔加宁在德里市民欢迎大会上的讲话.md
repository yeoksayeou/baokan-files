Esteemed Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Chairman of the Delhi Municipal Committee, our dear friends, citizens of the glorious capital of India – the outstanding city of Delhi:

　　First of all, please allow me, in my own name and on behalf of Comrade Khrushchev and our friends who have come with us, to thank the Indian government and the esteemed Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru for their gracious invitation, which has given us the opportunity to visit your great country and to learn more closely about the hard-working and capable people of your nation.
(Applause)
　　At the same time, please allow me to thank you all for your warm welcome. (Applause) We are deeply moved by this cordial reception, which we consider to be an expression of the sincere friendship of the great Indian people towards the Soviet people.
(Applause)
　　We convey to you, and through you to all four hundred million people of India, the warm greetings and best wishes of all the Soviet people, who harbor sincere and selfless feelings of friendship for the Indian people. (Applause)
　　The friendly relations between our two countries arose long ago, and there have never been any conflicts or hostilities. The friendly feelings between our two peoples have grown and developed especially after the great October Revolution in our country. (Applause)
　　The Soviet people, who have shaken off centuries of oppression, deeply sympathize with your heroic struggle to restore national independence. We are pleased with your achievements in this struggle, because we have always been against the oppression of some countries by others. (Applause) Our great leader and teacher, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, once declared that recognizing the equality of nations, recognizing the right of all peoples to self-determination, and recognizing the right of nations to exist independently are among the main principles of Soviet foreign policy. (Applause)
　　Since India became an independent and sovereign state, the development of friendship between our two countries has had new and more favorable conditions.
　　Now the relations between the Soviet Union and the Republic of India are built on a solid and reliable foundation, built on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs for any reason of an economic, political, or ideological nature, and built on equality, mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Five Principles first announced by India and the People's Republic of China (which you call "Panchsheel") have now been approved by all peace-loving people and are being effectively implemented by many countries. (Applause)
　　The Indian government has done much work in the past and is still doing much work to consolidate peace and ease international tensions. (Applause) The Soviet people, who have had to take up arms more than once to defend their homeland against foreign aggressors, are particularly clear about the endless disasters that war can bring to the people, and therefore they wholeheartedly welcome the efforts of the Indian government and the Indian people to maintain and consolidate peace. (Applause)
　　Our two countries are allies in the noble and great struggle for world peace on the international stage.
　　We are very pleased to note that on the extremely important issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, India, like the Soviet Union, has adopted a consistent and firm position. (Applause)
　　Our people have great sympathy for the efforts made by the Indian people and the Indian government in developing their national economy, especially in developing their own industry. (Applause) We believe from personal experience that only such a policy can guarantee the true independence of a country that has embarked on the road of independent development. Of course, you still have to overcome many difficulties, but we believe that the hard-working and wise Indian people will surely achieve their established goals. (Applause) For our part, we are ready to introduce to you our experience in building industrial enterprises, power stations, hydraulic engineering projects, peaceful utilization of atomic energy, and other achievements.
　　Now everything necessary is available to develop trade and economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and India on the basis of genuine equality and mutual benefit.
　　The relations between our two countries are increasingly broad and multifaceted in nature. In addition to the economic aspect, this relationship also includes scientific and cultural aspects. This is particularly pleasing because extensive cultural exchanges, the familiarity of the people of one country with the cultural treasures of the people of another country, can bring them closer and make them spiritually richer. We are in favor of comprehensive and extensive exchanges in culture and art.
　　Although the social and political systems of India and the Soviet Union are different, there are many commonalities between our two peoples, which strengthen our friendship and make it more solid and fruitful, not only for India and the Soviet Union, but also for the whole world. (Applause)
　　The commonalities between the Soviet people and the Indian people are that they are both peace-loving and hard-working people, and both peoples oppose racism and colonialism. They are actively fighting for the defense and consolidation of peace, for friendship and cooperation among all countries, and for national sovereignty and international security. (Applause)
　　Long live the friendship and cooperation between the people of India and the Soviet Union! (Stormy applause)
　　Long live India!
(Those attending the meeting responded to Bulganin's last sentence "Long live India" with stormy applause and enthusiastic cheers.)

　　布尔加宁在德里市民欢迎大会上的讲话敬爱的总理先生，德里市市政委员会主席先生，我们亲爱的朋友们，印度光荣的首都——卓越的德里市的市民们：
    首先请允许我用我个人的名义并且代表赫鲁晓夫同志以及同我们一起前来的我们朋友们，感谢印度政府和敬爱的总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生的盛意的邀请，这次邀请使我们有机会访问你们伟大的国家，更亲近地了解你们国家的勤劳能干的人民。
  （掌声）
    同时请允许我感谢你们大家的热烈欢迎。（掌声）我们为这种亲切的接待深受感动，认为这是伟大的印度人民对苏联人民的真挚的友谊的表现。
  （掌声）
    我们向你们，并且通过你们向印度全体四亿人民转达对印度人民怀抱真挚无私的友谊感情的全体苏联人民的热烈的问候和最好的愿望。（掌声）
    我们两国之间的友好关系老早就产生了，而且从来没有发生过冲突或是敌对的情况。我们两国人民之间的友好感情，在我们国家完成了伟大的十月革命以后特别成长和发展起来。（掌声）
    已经挣脱了许多世纪的压迫的苏联人民，深切同情你们为恢复民族独立而进行的英勇斗争。你们在这个斗争中的成就使我们感到高兴，因为我们一直是反对一些国家压迫另外一些国家的。（掌声）我们伟大的领袖和导师弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁曾经宣布，承认国家平等、承认各国人民有自决权和国家独立生存权利是苏联外交政策的主要原则之一。（掌声）
    自从印度成为一个独立的主权国家以后，我们两国友谊的发展就有了新的、更加有利的条件。
    现在苏联和印度共和国的关系建立在巩固和可靠的基础上，建立在互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯以及不以经济、政治和意识形态性质的任何理由干涉彼此的内政的原则上，建立在平等互利和和平共处的基础上。印度和中华人民共和国第一次宣布的五项原则（你们叫做“潘查希拉”），现在已经受到所有爱好和平的人民的赞同，并且正被许许多多国家有成效地实现着。（掌声）
    印度政府过去和现在为巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势做了许多工作。（掌声）苏联人民曾经不止一次地不得不拿起武器捍卫自己的国土，抵抗外国侵略者，他们特别清楚，战争会给人民带来怎样无穷无尽的灾难，因此他们衷心地欢迎印度政府和印度人民为维护和巩固和平而作的努力。（掌声）
    我们两个国家在国际舞台上是为世界和平而进行崇高的、伟大的斗争的同盟国。
    我们十分愉快地注意到，在像恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利这样一个极重要的问题上，印度同苏联一样，是采取一贯的和坚定的立场的。（掌声）
    我国人民对印度人民和印度政府在发展自己的国民经济方面、特别是发展本国的工业方面所作的努力，是怀着很大的同情的。（掌声）我们根据亲身经验相信，只有这样的政策才能保障一个已走上独立发展道路的国家的真正独立。当然，你们还得克服不少的困难，但是我们相信，热爱劳动的和智慧的印度人民一定会达到既定的目的。（掌声）在我们这方面，我们准备把建设工业企业、电力站、水力工程的经验，和平利用原子能的经验以及其他一些成就介绍给你们。
    现在已经具备一切必要条件在真正平等和互利的基础上来发展苏联和印度之间的贸易和经济合作。
    我们两国之间的关系日益具有广泛和多方面的性质。除经济方面以外，这种关系还包括了科学和文化方面。这件事情特别使人高兴，因为广泛的文化交流，一个国家的人民熟悉另一个国家的人民的文化宝藏能够使他们接近起来，并且使他们在精神上更加充实。我们赞成在文化和艺术方面实行全面的、广泛的交流。
    印度和苏联的社会和政治制度虽然各不相同，但是在我们两国人民之间却有很多共同之处，这些共同之处加强了我们的友谊，并且使这种友谊不仅为了印度和苏联，而且也为了全世界，而更加巩固和更富有成果。（掌声）
    苏联人民和印度人民之间的共同之处就是，他们都是热爱和平和爱好劳动的人民，两国人民都反对种族主义和殖民主义。他们积极地为保卫和巩固和平，为各国的友谊和合作，为国家主权和国际安全而斗争。（掌声）
    印苏两国人民的友谊和合作万岁！（暴风雨般的掌声）
    印度万岁！
      （参加大会的人对布尔加宁最后的一句话“印度万岁”报以暴风雨般的掌声和热烈的欢呼。）
