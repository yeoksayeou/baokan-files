    The Joy of Huangyan Orange Farmers
    He Suxin
    The nationally renowned Huangyan honey oranges of Zhejiang are about to hit the market. In October, entering Huangyan County, Zhejiang, one can see orange groves of red and green intermingling from afar, and hear the sweet songs of the orange farmers: "The scenery on both banks of the Chengjiang River is beautiful, the rolling water stirs up waves, the orange fruits hang heavily and the trees bend, Huangyan honey oranges are harvested again, everyone is happy."
    Since liberation, the output of Huangyan honey oranges has increased year by year. In 1954, an unprecedented bumper harvest of 680,000 dan was achieved, an increase of 1.7 times compared with the pre-liberation annual output of 250,000 dan in 1943. This spring, Huangyan honey oranges suffered from the most severe frost damage in 30 years, but this year's output still reached 470,000 dan, an increase of 27% compared with 1953.
    In the Huangyan orange-growing area, under the active leadership of the people's government in recent years, 136 orange farmer production cooperatives have been organized, giving full play to the superiority of collective management. In 1952, Soviet experts Vasilyev, Runfelge, and Ishenadueva came to Huangyan orange orchards for field investigation and guidance, and put forward the main methods for increasing production. The orange farmers accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, vigorously cleaned up the orange orchards, and overcame the most harmful malignant leaf insects, scale insects, and rust mites, which greatly developed citrus production. The orange yield of the Huangyan Orange Farmer Labor Model Advanced Production Cooperative has increased year by year, with 1952 as 100, 1953 reaching 110, and 1954 reaching 150. This year, the number of members has doubled, and orange production has increased by more than 10% on the original basis. Tao Fuchu, a poor peasant from Xiaoyou Township, harvested only 1,200 jin per mu from his two mu of orange orchard before liberation. In 1952, it had reached 3,100 jin, and he joined the production cooperative after the autumn harvest in 1954. He became the director of the cooperative, not only achieving a bumper harvest himself, but also increasing citrus production throughout the cooperative. The orange farmers reflected: "In the past, we couldn't even afford to eat, but now we have organized cooperatives, and Soviet friends have helped us improve our technology. The oranges have a bumper harvest, and our lives have also improved."

    黄岩橘农们的喜悦
    何素心
    闻名全国的浙江黄岩蜜橘快要上市了，十月间，进入浙江黄岩县就可以远远望见红绿相映的橘树林，人们可以听到橘农们唱着悦耳的歌谣：澄江两岸风光好，滚滚流水起浪潮，橘果累累树弯腰，黄岩蜜橘又丰收，人人皆欢笑。
    解放以来，黄岩蜜橘产量逐年提高，一九五四年获得空前大丰收，达六十八万担，比解放前一九四三年年产量二十五万担增产一点七倍。今年春季黄岩蜜橘遭受到三十年来所未有的冻害，但今年的产量仍达到四十七万担，比一九五三年增产二成七。
    黄岩橘区，几年来在人民政府积极领导下，组织了一百三十六个橘农生产合作社，发挥了集体经营的优越性；一九五二年苏联专家华西列夫、润菲尔格和伊先纳督娃来黄岩橘园实地考察指导，提出了增产的主要办法。橘农们接受了苏联的先进经验，大力清理橘园，克服了危害最重的恶性叶虫、介壳虫、锈壁虱，使柑橘生产大大发展起来。黄岩橘农劳模先进生产合作社，橘子产量逐年提高，以一九五二年为一百，一九五三年达一百一十，一九五四年达一百五十，今年社员增多一倍，橘子生产在原有基础上增加一成以上。孝友乡贫农陶福初二亩橘园，解放前每亩只收到一千二百斤，一九五二年已达三千一百斤，一九五四年秋收后参加了生产合作社。他担任了社长，不但他自己取得丰收，并使全社柑橘生产都得到增产。橘农们反映说：过去，我们连饭也吃不上，现在组织了合作社，苏联朋友帮助我们改进技术，橘子丰收了，生活也改善了。
