	The Bumper Harvest of the Mars Collective Farm
	Zeng Bin
	The area where Urumqi County and Changji County in Xinjiang meet is a vast plain. In the middle of this plain, near Huangshui Caozi, lies the first collective farm established in Xinjiang – the Mars Collective Farm. In October, the autumn crops had already been harvested. On the farm's various threshing grounds, the rice bundles were piled as high as battlements. The threshed grain and accumulated corn cobs resembled mountains of gold and silver. The sounds of threshing machines and tractors plowing the autumn fields from the Anningqu Tractor Station echoed across the fields. Carts loaded with packaged grain, oilseeds, and joyful farm members traveled back and forth on the roads. Everywhere, there was a sense of joy after the harvest.

	This year, the per-unit-area yield of crops on this farm has, in many cases, far exceeded that of last year. For example, spring wheat yielded an average of over 128 jin per mu last year, and an average of over 188 jin per mu this year. Safflower (an oilseed crop) yielded an average of 78 jin per mu last year, and an average of 100 jin per mu this year. In particular, rice yielded an average of over 410 jin per mu last year, and an average of 547 jin per mu this year. Such high yields have never been seen before in the Huangshui Caozi area. The Huangshui Caozi area was originally a low-lying, damp reed marsh with a high water table, soil with high salt and alkali content, and rampant weed growth. For many years, only a small portion of the land had been cultivated, with the rest mostly left barren. In the spring of 1953, the Mars Collective Farm, composed of 125 unemployed laborers from Urumqi City, began arduous reclamation work here. Over the past three years, they have continuously improved farming techniques and carried out some basic agricultural construction projects. The cultivated area has increased from more than 2,000 mu to 4,960 mu, and the yield of various crops has increased year by year. These facts have convinced farmers both inside and outside the farm of the farm's production advantages. As a result, the number of farmers requesting to join the farm after the autumn harvest has been increasing day by day. After careful consideration, the farm has also decided to admit more than 40 new farm members after the autumn harvest.

    火星集体农庄的丰收
    曾斌
    新疆乌鲁木齐县和昌吉县交界的地方，是一片广大的平原，在这片平原中间黄水槽子一带，是新疆境内建立起来的第一个集体农庄——火星集体农庄。十月天，秋庄稼已经割完，农庄的各个场上，稻捆堆得城垛一样高，碾下的粮食和堆积的玉米棒子，好像一座一座的金山银山。从安宁渠拖拉机站来的打粮机和翻耕秋地拖拉机的响声震荡原野，满载着包装好的粮食、油料和欢欣的庄员的马车在大道上来来往往，到处都呈现着丰收后的喜悦。
    今年这个农庄庄稼的单位面积产量，有好些都远远地超过了去年。像春麦，去年每亩平均收一百二十八斤多，今年每亩平均收一百八十八斤多；红花（一种油料作物）去年每亩平均收七十八斤，今年每亩平均收一百斤。特别是水稻，去年每亩平均收到四百一十多斤，今年每亩平均收到五百四十七斤。这样高的产量，在黄水槽子一带是从来没有过的事情。黄水槽子这块地方，原是低湿的苇湖草滩，地下水位很高，土壤含盐碱份很大，杂草生长凶猛。多少年来，除了很少一部分土地曾经耕作外，其余大都荒芜着。一九五三年春天，由乌鲁木齐市一百二十五户无固定职业的劳动人民组成的火星集体农庄，在这里开始了艰苦的垦殖工作。三年来，不断改进耕作技术，并进行一些农田基本建设工程，实播耕地面积，已由二千多亩增至四千九百六十亩，各种庄稼的产量，也一年比一年提高。以上事实使庄内外农民都信服了农庄在生产上的强处，因而秋后要求入庄的农户，已是一天比一天增加。庄内经过详细的考虑，也决定在秋后吸收四十多户新庄员。
