　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 16th: TASS Moscow, November 15th: In view of the incorrect reports in certain French newspapers regarding the content of Khrushchev's conversation with foreign journalists at the reception held at the Norwegian Embassy in Moscow on November 12th, TASS is authorized to issue the following statement:
    The aforementioned conversation was merely a brief exchange of views on various issues. During this conversation, some Western journalists expressed their opinions on the situation in France. In this regard, Khrushchev said to them that France is a good country, but unfortunately, due to its wavering and indecisive policy on the issue of safeguarding peace, it does not currently occupy the great power status it is entitled to.
    Since the journalists expressed opinions on the French parliamentary elections to be held in December, Khrushchev pointed out that elections certainly cannot change the social system, but they can greatly influence the future direction of French policy. If France can choose a course of action that strives to consolidate peace and European security, it would be a major contribution to safeguarding European security. Of course, the men and women of the Soviet Union, like the peace-loving people of France, hope that things develop in this direction.

　　就赫鲁晓夫关于法国的谈话
　　塔斯社受权发表声明
    新华社十六日讯　塔斯社莫斯科十五日讯：由于法国某些报纸对赫鲁晓夫十一月十二日在莫斯科挪威大使馆招待会上同外国记者谈话的内容报道得不正确，塔斯社受权发表下列声明：
    上述谈话不过是属于对不同的问题稍事交换一下简短的意见的性质，在这次谈话中，某些西方国家的记者提出了自己对法国情况的意见。在这方面，赫鲁晓夫向他们说，法国是一个很好的国家，但是非常遗憾，由于它对保障和平问题的政策动摇和犹豫不定，现在它并没有占有它有权享有的大国地位。
    由于记者们对要在十二月举行的法国议会选举表示了意见，赫鲁晓夫指出，选举当然不能改变社会制度，可是能够大大地影响法国政策今后的方向。如果法国能够选择为巩固和平和欧洲安全而斗争的方针，那将是对保障欧洲安全的一个重大贡献。当然，苏联的男女，就像法国爱好和平的人民一样，希望事态朝这个方向发展。
