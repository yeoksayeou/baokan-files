    The Construction of Guangzhou Overseas Chinese New Village
    Wu Erxiang
    The Yu Zi (Jade Son) Hill and Xian Ke (Shell) Hill area in the scenic center of Guangzhou used to be a verdant mountain range. Since the Guangzhou Municipal People's Committee designated it as the site for the construction of the Overseas Chinese New Village, this hill has begun to change. Now it is covered with construction scaffolding, and beautiful buildings are emerging one after another on the hill. The Overseas Chinese Primary School building, which can accommodate 1,000 students, on the top of Yu Zi Hill, only started construction in April this year, and now more than 300 children of overseas Chinese are studying there.
    Standing on the top of Yu Zi Hill, looking around, one can see the slightly distant green and undulating mountains, and the nearby bamboo forests and fruit trees weaving a natural screen that surrounds the new village. Yu Zi Hill and Xian Ke Hill are closely connected. This area is approximately 200,000 square meters, enough to build about 300 houses.
    The Overseas Chinese New Village project is planned in three phases. The first phase includes a primary school building and fifty residential buildings. The primary school building and auditorium have now been completed, and efforts are being made to complete the residential construction by the end of this year. After the completion of the entire new village project, there will be cinemas, cultural centers, sports fields, clinics, nurseries, and small markets here. The government will also build a road in the new village to connect with Xianlie (Martyrs) Road on the east side of the new village. Various southern fruit trees, such as lychees, longans, and bananas, will be planted along the road. By then, the Overseas Chinese New Village will be the most beautiful garden residential area in Guangzhou.
    Standing on Xian Ke Hill, one can already see the outlines of the residential buildings emerging from the construction scaffolding. These are all two-story buildings. Each house is surrounded by open space equal to more than twice the area of the house, and this open space is provided by the government free of charge for homeowners to create private gardens. Land for building does not need to be purchased, and property taxes are very low. There is also a special tax exemption for five years. Any overseas Chinese who wish to build a house in the new village only need to entrust the New Village Construction Preparatory Committee to handle it, and they don't need to worry about anything.
    Now, returning overseas Chinese passing through Guangzhou come here to visit. They see that building a house in the new village is not only inexpensive and simple in procedure, but also has a quiet environment, and convenient schooling for children. They are deeply grateful for the government's care for overseas Chinese. To date, overseas Chinese have registered with the New Village Construction Preparatory Committee to build more than 100 houses.

    建设中的广州市华侨新村
    吴尔祥
    广州市风景区中心的玉子岗和蚬壳岗一带，过去是一片青翠的山岗。自从广州市人民委员会把它划为建筑华侨新村的地址后，这个岗子开始变了样。现在这里已布满了建筑棚架，一幢幢美丽的楼房正陆续出现在岗子上。玉子岗顶峰上的可容一千名学生的华侨小学大厦，今年四月才开始施工，现在已经有三百多华侨子弟在里面念书了。
    站在玉子岗顶峰上，举目四望，看到那稍远处碧绿起伏的山岗，和附近的竹林果树织成一幅天然的围屏，把新村围绕起来。玉子岗和蚬壳岗紧紧相连着。这一带面积大约有二十万平方公尺，可以建屋三百幢左右。
    华侨新村工程计划分三期进行。第一期工程包括一座小学大厦和五十幢的住宅工程。现在小学大厦和大礼堂已完工，住宅工程也争取在今年年底完成。新村的全部工程完成以后，这里将有电影院、文化馆、运动场、医疗所、托儿所和小市场。政府还将在新村修一条马路和围绕在新村东面的先烈路相接。马路旁将遍植各种南方果树，如荔枝、龙眼、香蕉等。到那时，华侨新村将是广州市最美丽的花园住宅区。
    站在蚬壳岗上，已经可以看到从建筑棚架中露出的住宅轮廓，那都是两层的建筑。每幢住宅周围都留有约等于房屋面积一倍以上的空地，这些空地都是政府免费准备给屋主布置私人花园用的。建屋用地也不用买，房地产税又很便宜。还特许免税五年。凡愿意在新村建屋的华侨，只要委托给新村筹建委员会办理，什么都不用操心。
    现在路过广州的归国华侨，都要到这里来参观。他们看到在新村建屋，不但费用便宜，手续简便，环境清幽，而且子弟入学方便，都深深感激政府对华侨的关怀。到目前止，华侨已在新村筹建委员会登记建屋一百多幢。
