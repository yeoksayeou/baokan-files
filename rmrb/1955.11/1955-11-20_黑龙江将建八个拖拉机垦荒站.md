Heilongjiang to Build Eight Tractor Reclamation Stations

Heilongjiang Province will build eight tractor reclamation stations composed of 460 tractors next year. These eight tractor reclamation stations will set up 90 tractor reclamation teams, preparing to carry out large-scale land reclamation in a planned way and organize immigrant production throughout the year.

The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee began various preparations for station construction in mid-October. After selection and exploration, the station sites have been basically determined in eight areas in the province where wasteland is concentrated and easy to reclaim, such as Luobei, Gannan, and Fuyu counties. At present, the tractor drivers, farm implement operators, repair workers, and administrative and technical management personnel needed for the tractor reclamation stations and teams have been basically resolved with the strong support of state-owned mechanical farms, tractor stations, and other units. Nearly a thousand tractor drivers and more than three hundred administrative and technical management personnel will begin intensive training in late November.

After the establishment of these tractor reclamation stations, they can reclaim 3.5 million to 4 million mu of wasteland every year. If all the organized immigrants cultivate the land, they can produce 300,000 tons of grain for the state every year based on the normal yield. (Ma Qingtan)

　　黑龙江将建八个拖拉机垦荒站
    黑龙江省将在明年兴建拥有四百六十部机车组成的八个拖拉机垦荒站。这八个拖拉机垦荒站下面将设立九十个拖拉机垦荒队，准备有计划地进行大规模的垦荒和常年组织移民生产。
    黑龙江省人民委员会从十月中旬便开始了各项建站准备工作，经过选择勘察后，目前站址已基本确定在全省荒原集中并易于开垦的萝北、甘南、富裕县等八个地区。目前，拖拉机垦荒站、队需要的拖拉机驾驶员、农具手、修理工人和行政、技术管理人员在各国营机械农场、拖拉机站等单位大力支援下，已基本上解决。十一月下旬将有近千名拖拉机驾驶员和三百余名行政、技术管理人员开始集训。
    这些拖拉机垦荒站建立以后，每年可开垦荒地三百五十万到四百万市亩，如果组织移民全部耕种起来，按常年产量，每年可为国家生产三十万吨粮食。　（马清潭）
