Zhang Axi, a young foundry worker at the Shanghai Xinzhong Power Machine Factory, a joint state-private enterprise, completed the workload originally scheduled for January 11, 1958, more than two years ahead of schedule on November 5th. Since the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, Zhang Axi has consistently exceeded his monthly targets by an average of 180 to 190 percent. He has now made a new guarantee: to complete eight years' worth of work during the period of the first Five-Year Plan.

Zhang Axi is only twenty-one years old this year, but he already has nearly ten years of work experience. The castings he makes are small, complex, and fragmented. But he always does them very well. For example, in casting a relatively complex part of a gasoline engine, the intake and exhaust manifold, it used to take ten hours to make one. He has made seven improvements to the operating methods and now only needs forty-eight minutes to make one.

Zhang Axi also pays close attention to reducing rejects. For more than two years, his reject rate has been consistently below the administratively prescribed target.

Every day after work, Zhang Axi checks the production situation of the day and pre-arranges the work for the next day. Every morning, he arrives at the workshop early to prepare all the tools and auxiliary materials he needs for the day, one by one. As soon as the work bell rings, he immediately starts working.

　  章阿锡完成五年计划工作量
    公私合营上海新中动力机厂青年铸工章阿锡在十一月五日这天，已经提前两年多的时间完成了一九五八年一月十一日的工作量。章阿锡从第一个五年计划开始以来，每月平均超额百分之一百八十到一百九十完成任务。现在他又提出新的保证：要在第一个五年计划期间，完成八年的工作量。
    章阿锡今年才二十一岁，可是他已有了近十年的工龄。他做的铸件细小复杂而又零碎。但他总是做得非常出色。譬如在浇铸汽油机上的一个比较复杂的零件进排气管时，需要十小时才能做一只，他先后在操作方法上作了七次改进，现在只要花四十八分钟就可以做好一只。
    章阿锡还经常注意减少废品，两年多来，他的废品率一直在行政规定的指标以下。
    每天下班后，章阿锡都要检查一下当天的生产情况，把第二天的工作预先安排好。每天早上他都提早进车间，把当天需要的工具和辅助材料一样样地准备好。上班铃一响，他立刻开始工作。
