Farmers in Wuzhuang Township, Langqi District, Minhou County, Fujian Province, dried and cleaned their millet in order to invest in expanding the winter planting area, and prepared to sell it to the state in advance. However, the staff at the Wuzhuang grain purchasing station repeatedly refused to purchase it, saying, "The warehouse equipment is not ready, so we cannot accept it." In reality, the warehouse had been cleaned up and even the scales were ready, but they were unwilling to accept the farmers' small-scale sales of grain. The Riguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in this township had to spare five laborers from the busiest time of winter planting to carry millet to a more distant grain station to sell it because they were waiting for money to buy plows. The twelve households in the Lin Yizhang mutual aid group could not buy seeds because they could not sell their millet, and so far they have not planted even a fraction of their land.

The farmers are dissatisfied with the bureaucratic attitude of the staff at the Wuzhuang grain purchasing station. They said, "The government is calling on us to expand the winter planting area, but why doesn't the grain purchasing station accept our grain?"

Regarding this matter, the head of Wuzhuang Township once wrote a letter to the superior grain station requesting a prompt solution to this problem, but has not received a reply. The Minhou County government should investigate and deal with this matter.

　  不该拒绝农民提前售粮
    福建省闽侯县琅岐区吴庄乡的农民为了投资扩大冬种面积，把谷子晒干颺净，准备提前卖给国家。但是吴庄粮食收购点的工作人员却一再拒绝收购，说：“仓库设备没准备好，不能收。”实际上，仓库已经整理得干干净净，连磅秤都准备好了，只是他们不愿意接收农民零星出售的粮食。这个乡的日光农业生产合作社由于等钱买犁头，只好在冬种最忙的时候，抽出五个劳动力挑了谷子到更远的粮站去出卖。林依章互助组的十二户农民因为谷子卖不出去，没有钱买种子，直到现在一分地也没种。
    农民们对吴庄粮食收购点工作人员的官僚主义态度是不满意的，他们说：“政府号召我们扩大冬种面积，可是粮食收购点为什么不收我们的粮食？”
    为了这件事，吴庄乡乡长曾经写信给上级粮站，要求迅速解决这个问题，但是一直没有得到答复。闽侯县政府对这件事情应该检查处理。
