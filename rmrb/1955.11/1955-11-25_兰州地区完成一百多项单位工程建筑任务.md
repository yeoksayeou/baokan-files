　　Lanzhou Area Completes Over One Hundred Unit Engineering Construction Tasks
　　(Our Newspaper News) By November 15th, the Northwest Lanzhou Engineering Corporation of the Ministry of Construction Engineering had completed 151 unit projects, accounting for 82.02% of the revised annual plan.
　　Among these projects, those that have been fully or substantially completed and handed over to the owners for use include the main building of the expansion section of the Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant and the newly built power distribution building, the main building of the Lanzhou Xinlan Flour Mill, the factory buildings of the Lanzhou Dairy Farm of the Gansu Provincial Animal Husbandry Department, as well as office buildings, teaching buildings, cinemas, dormitories, canteens, warehouses, and railway station platforms. The expansion section of the Lanzhou Power Plant is currently undergoing installation and trial runs, with some generators scheduled to officially transmit electricity in late November. The expanded power generation capacity will be two and a half times greater than the power plant's 1953 output. Once the entire expansion section is generating power, it will not only meet the electricity needs of the people of Lanzhou but also ensure the power supply for industrial capital construction in Lanzhou next year. After the Lanzhou Xinlan Flour Mill officially starts production, its daily flour output will be sufficient to feed 500,000 people for a day. The Northwest Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, constructed by the Northwest Lanzhou Engineering Corporation, will undertake the task of conducting comprehensive scientific research in coordination with industrial construction. As the material needs of the people of Lanzhou continue to grow, the dairy farm will adopt advanced Soviet experience to breed superior dairy cows and produce milk to supply the daily needs of the people of Lanzhou.
　　In order to comprehensively fulfill this year's national plan and welcome next year's industrial capital construction tasks, the Northwest Lanzhou Engineering Corporation is not only working intensively on the finishing touches of most projects but also preparing to commence winter construction on five unit projects within the annual plan and eighty-five newly added unit projects. Among the newly added projects, sixty-seven unit projects are for the construction of subsidiary enterprises that will serve large-scale factory and mechanized construction in the coming year.

　　兰州地区完成一百多项单位工程建筑任务
    本报讯　建筑工程部西北兰州工程总公司到十一月十五日，已经完成了一百五十一项单位工程，占修改后的本年度计划的百分之八十二点零二。
    在这些工程中，全部或基本竣工并已交给业主使用的，计有兰州火电站扩建部分的主厂房和新建的配电楼、兰州新兰面粉厂的主厂房、甘肃省畜牧厅兰州奶牛场的厂房建筑等，以及办公楼、教学楼、电影院、宿舍、食堂、仓库和火车站台等。兰州电厂扩建部分现在正一面安装，一面进行试车，其中部分发电机将在十一月下旬正式送电。扩建后的发电量将比这个火电站一九五三年的发电量大二倍半，扩建部分全部发电后，不仅可以满足兰州市人民的生活用电，而且可以保证明年兰州工业基本建设的施工用电。兰州新兰面粉厂正式生产后，面粉日产量将可供五十万人吃一天。西北兰州工程总公司承建的西北科学分院，将担负起配合工业建设从事综合性科学研究工作的任务。随着兰州人民日益增长的物质需要，奶牛场将采用苏联先进经验，进行优良奶牛配种，出产牛奶供应兰州人民生活需要。
    西北兰州工程总公司为了全面完成今年国家计划，并迎接明年的工业基本建设任务，目前除大部工程正紧张进行收尾工作外，另有五项年度计划内的单位工程和新近增加的八十五个单位工程，即将开始冬季施工。新增加的工程有六十七个单位工程是为明年度进行大规模工厂化、机械化施工服务的附属企业建设。
