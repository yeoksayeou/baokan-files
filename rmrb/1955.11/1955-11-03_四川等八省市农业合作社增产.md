Xinhua News Agency, 1st. Agricultural Production cooperatives in Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Hunan, Henan, Anhui provinces and the suburbs of Shanghai have mostly increased production. Of the 30,300 cooperatives established in Sichuan Province (including areas formerly belonging to Xikang Province) before the spring plowing this year, 95% generally increased production by 10% to 30% compared to before the establishment of the cooperatives last year. About 90% of the more than 7,000 cooperatives in Yunnan Province and the more than 6,400 cooperatives in Guizhou Province increased production this year. The per unit area yield of most cooperatives in Qinghai Province increased significantly this year, and many cooperatives achieved large-scale high yields. The per unit area yield of 17 cooperatives in the suburbs of Xining City was about 10% to 36% higher than that of local mutual aid teams and individual farmers. According to statistics from 10,345 cooperatives in Hunan Province that have basically completed the preliminary distribution of early rice and mid-season rice, 89.2% increased production by 10% to 50%; 5% of the cooperatives maintained the production level before the establishment of the cooperatives. Among the 24,012 cooperatives in Xuchang, Kaifeng, Anyang, Xinxiang, Xinyang, and Nanyang special districts of Henan Province that have formulated autumn income distribution plans, 80% to 90% increased production compared to last year and compared to farmers outside the cooperatives. The more than 670 old cooperatives established in Anhui Province in 1952 and 1953 have increased production year after year, and the per unit area yield has also increased year by year. According to preliminary statistics from 722 cooperatives in the suburbs of Shanghai, the income of more than 90% of the cooperatives increased by 10% to 200% compared to last year. The rice and cotton planted by these cooperatives this year have all achieved bumper harvests.

The widespread increase in production of agricultural production cooperatives has also increased the income of cooperative members. Among the more than 30,000 cooperatives in Sichuan Province, more than 90% of the cooperative members increased their income compared to last year; about 3% of the cooperative members maintained last year's income level; only about 7% of the cooperative members had a slight decrease in income this year due to lack of labor or other reasons. For cooperative members whose income decreased, many cooperatives allocated public welfare funds to subsidize them, or helped them engage in sideline production to increase income. More than 90% of cooperative farmers in Qinghai Province increased their income, with the least increasing by 100 to 200 catties of grain compared to last year, and most increasing by more than 1,000 catties compared to last year. According to statistics from 3,851 cooperatives in Xiangtan, Hengyang, Shaoyang and other five special districts of Hunan Province, the income of more than 85% of the cooperative members increased; the income of 5% of the cooperative members did not increase or decrease; after the cooperatives vigorously developed diversified operations and increased sideline production, the vast majority of cooperative members whose income decreased could maintain their original income level. The income of agricultural cooperative members in the suburbs of Shanghai is generally more than 20% higher than that of farmers outside the cooperatives.

The fact that agricultural production cooperatives have increased production has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the surrounding farmers to take the path of collectivization. During the income distribution of cooperatives in Xiangtan Special District, Hunan Province, more than 70,000 farmers applied to join the cooperatives, of which more than 60% were poor and lower-middle peasants. After the agricultural cooperatives in Suining, Neijiang and other 20 counties in Sichuan Province distributed their income, more than 36,000 mutual aid groups and mutual aid teams requested to join or establish cooperatives. After the members of 17 cooperatives in Shenjiagang Township, Anyang County, Henan Province, introduced the changes in their lives to farmers outside the cooperatives, 213 farmers applied to join the old cooperatives, and another 220 farmers prepared to establish nine agricultural cooperatives. In Anhui Province, the collectivization movement has been vigorously launched in all places where there are old cooperatives, and many townships where old cooperatives are located have become collectivized townships.

    四川等八省市农业合作社增产
    新华社一日讯　四川、云南、贵州、青海、湖南、河南、安徽等七省和上海市郊区的农业生产合作社绝大部分增产。四川全省（包括原西康省所属地区）今年春耕以前建立的三万零三百多个社，百分之九十五一般比去年建社前增产一成到三成。云南省的七千多个社和贵州省的六千四百多个社，今年都有百分之九十左右的社增产。青海省绝大部分社的单位面积产量今年显著提高，不少社获得了大面积丰产。西宁市郊十七个社的单位面积产量，比当地互助组和单干农民高出百分之十到三十六左右。湖南省据已经基本结束早稻、中稻预分工作的一万零三百四十五个社的统计，百分之八十九点二增产一成到五成；百分之五的社保住了建社前的生产水平。河南省许昌、开封、安阳、新乡、信阳、南阳六个专区的已制定秋季收益分配方案的二万四千零十二个社中，百分之八十到九十比去年和比社外农民都增产。安徽省一九五二年和一九五三年先后建立的六百七十多个老社连年增产，单位面积产量也逐年提高。上海市郊区据七百二十二个社的初步统计，百分之九十以上的社收入比去年增加一成到二倍。这些社今年种植的水稻、棉花都获得大丰收。
    各地农业生产合作社普遍增产，社员的收入也随着增加。在四川省的三万多个社中，百分之九十以上的社员比去年增加了收入；百分之三左右的社员收入保持去年水平；只有约百分之七的社员因为缺乏劳动力或有其他原因，今年收入略有减少。对收入减少的社员，许多社都拨出公益金给予补助，或者帮助他们进行副业生产来增加收入。青海省入社农户中有百分之九十以上增加了收入，最少的比去年多收粮食一二百斤，大多数比去年多收一千多斤。湖南省据湘潭、衡阳、邵阳等五个专区的三千八百五十一个社的统计，百分之八十五以上的社员收入增加；百分之五的社员收入不增不减；各社大力开展多种经营、增加副业生产后，收入减少的社员中绝大多数都可保持原来收入水平。上海市郊区农业社社员的收入一般也比社外农民多二成以上。
    农业生产合作社增产的事实，大大鼓舞了周围农民走合作化道路的积极性。湖南省湘潭专区各社在进行收益分配中，就有七万多户农民申请入社，其中百分之六十以上是贫农和下中农。四川省遂宁、内江等二十个县的农业社分配收益后，有三万六千多个互助联组和互助组要求入社或办社。河南省安阳县申家岗乡十七个社由社员向社外农民介绍他们入社的生活变化后，申请加入老社的农民有二百一十三户，还有二百二十户农民准备建立九个农业社。安徽省现在凡是有老社的地方，合作化运动都已蓬勃展开，很多老社所在的乡都已成了合作化乡。
