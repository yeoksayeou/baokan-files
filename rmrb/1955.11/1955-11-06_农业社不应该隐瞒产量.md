    Agricultural Cooperatives Should Not Conceal Production
    To the Editor:
    The Xiaoheidaozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yushi County, Shanxi Province, had a very good wheat crop this year due to improved farming techniques and increased fertilization. When the wheat matured, some cooperative members had doubts about the "Three Fixes" policy. The cooperative director, Zhang Shuzhen (a Communist Party member), not only did not explain the "Three Fixes" policy to these members, but also underreported the wheat yield to deceive the state. He colluded with the accountant, Zhang Mingxing, and the village director, Wang Xingyun, to establish two sets of accounts: a false set for the higher authorities to inspect and a true set that would never be revealed. This erroneous practice of deceiving the state was discussed and agreed upon within the Party group and then announced at a general meeting of cooperative members. No one objected at the meeting, and the matter was decided in this way. Zhang Shuzhen repeatedly urged everyone not to "leak the news," saying that "whoever speaks will be held responsible."
    In mid-July, the wheat was stored in the warehouse, totaling 170.55 shi. Initially, Zhang Shuzhen reported to the county that they had harvested 105 shi. The county felt that this number was not accurate and asked them to re-examine it thoroughly. Zhang Shuzhen immediately added seven shi upon returning and said that this number "would not have any errors." The county, based on the good soil quality of the cooperative's wheat fields, the amount of fertilizer used, and the results of the evaluation when the wheat was nearing maturity, felt that this number was still not accurate. Through the further implementation of the "Three Fixes" policy by Comrade Wang Mosuo, the Party Branch Secretary of this township, and Qiao Runsheng from the work team, the masses were enlightened, and the internal Party education was emphasized. Party member Wang Xingyun first examined his mistake of not adhering to the Party's position and exposed that the cooperative had concealed more than 58 shi of wheat. Only then did Zhang Shuzhen reluctantly admit the mistake of concealing production.
    Zhang Shuzhen had violated Party discipline in last year's unified grain purchase and sales work and was given a punishment of being placed on probation within the Party. Now, he has committed the same kind of error. This proves that he cannot subordinate his personal interests to the interests of the Party. It is hoped that the Yushi County Committee of the Communist Party of China will seriously deal with this matter.

### 农业社不应该隐瞒产量

    农业社不应该隐瞒产量编辑同志：
    山西榆社县小黑道庄农业生产合作社，今年由于改进了耕作技术，加工加肥，小麦生长得很好。当小麦成熟的时候，有的社员对“三定”政策有怀疑，社长张书珍（共产党员）不但不向这些社员解释“三定”政策，反而少报了小麦产量，来欺骗国家。他串通了会计张明星和村主任王星云，决定建立两套账，一套假账专供上级审查，另一套真的永不露面。这个欺骗国家的错误做法在党小组里串通了以后，又在社员大会上宣布；当场没有人反对，事情就算这样决定了。张书珍再三叮嘱大家不要“走漏风声”，说是“谁说了谁负责任”。
    七月中旬，小麦收到了库，一共是一百七十点五五石。开始张书珍向县里报告说打了一百零五石，县里觉得这个数字不够准确，就叫他们重新澄底。张书珍回来以后马上又加了七石，并说这个数字“再也不会有差错了”。县里根据这个社麦地土质好、肥料多和小麦快成熟时评比的结果，觉得这个数字还不确实。经过这个乡的党支部书记王磨锁同志和工作组的乔润生进一步贯彻“三定”政策，启发群众觉悟，并且着重做好党内教育工作，党员王星云首先检讨了自己没有坚持党的立场的错误，揭穿了社里隐瞒小麦产量五十八石多的底。这样张书珍才勉强承认了隐瞒产量的错误。
    张书珍在去年粮食统购工作中曾经违犯党纪，受到留党察看的处分；现在又犯了同样性质的错误。这证明他不能以个人利益服从党的利益。希望中共榆社县委予以严肃处理。
