　　Ministry of Education Issues Instructions on Strengthening In-Service Training for Secondary School Teachers
    The Ministry of Education recently issued instructions on strengthening in-service training for teachers in secondary schools.

    The instructions pointed out that in-service training for secondary school teachers should mainly be carried out through teacher training colleges or correspondence education programs offered by higher normal colleges. The Ministry of Education has decided to raise all existing secondary school teachers who have not graduated from normal colleges to the level of normal college graduates within eight years (from 1955 to 1962).

    The instructions stipulated that teacher training colleges should generally be established in large and medium-sized cities, either independently or attached to higher normal schools. Correspondence education programs offered by higher normal colleges should primarily target secondary school teachers in small and medium-sized towns and rural areas. Both teacher training colleges and correspondence education programs should offer specialized classes in various subjects. The duration of study should be tentatively set at three years. The teaching plan should be formulated based on a streamlined version of the provisional teaching plan for normal colleges, and the teaching syllabus and materials can generally adopt the teaching syllabus and materials of relevant subjects in normal colleges. Correspondence education programs offered by higher normal colleges should also compile study guidance documents as needed.

    The instructions stipulated that the time for in-service training for secondary school teachers should, in principle, be ten to twelve hours per week. To ensure the study time of teachers undergoing training, education departments and bureaus of provinces and cities should formulate specific measures, such as reducing their concurrent posts, uniformly arranging the courses they teach, and providing necessary review time before exams.

    The instructions also stipulated that for teachers who are unable to participate in teacher training colleges or correspondence education programs offered by higher normal colleges, education departments and bureaus should organize them to form study groups to study collectively or individually in their spare time, and discuss together. Study groups can generally use the teaching materials of correspondence education programs offered by higher normal colleges as study materials. Study groups should establish necessary study systems. Educational administrative departments and school leaders should strengthen their leadership and assistance to them. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　教育部发出加强中学教师业余进修的指示
    教育部最近发出关于加强中等学校在职教师业余进修的指示。
    指示中指出，中等学校教师业余进修主要是通过教师进修学院或高等师范函授教育的方式进行。教育部决定在八年内（一九五五年到一九六二年）把现有中等学校中不到师范专科学校毕业程度的教师全部提高到师范专科学校毕业的程度。
    指示规定，教师进修学院一般设在大、中城市，单独成立或附设在高等师范学校内。高等师范函授教育主要由高等师范学校办理，招生对象以中、小城镇和农村中的中等学校教师为主。教师进修学院和高等师范函授教育都设置各科专修班；修业年限都暂定三年；教学计划应该根据师范专科学校暂行教学计划加以精简后制定，教学大纲和教材一般可采用师范专科学校有关科目的教学大纲和教材。高等师范函授教育还应该根据需要，编写学习指导文件。
    指示规定中等学校教师业余进修时间，每周以十到十二小时为原则。为保证进修教师的学习时间，各省、市教育厅、局应该定出具体办法，如减少他们的兼职，统一安排他们所担任的课程，考试前给以必要的复习时间等。
    指示并规定对未能参加教师进修学院或高等师范函授学习的教师，应由教育厅、局组织他们成立进修小组，在业余时间集体学习或个人学习，共同讨论。进修小组一般可采用高等师范函授教育的教材作为学习材料。进修小组应该规定必要的学习制度。教育行政部门和学校领导上应该加强对他们的领导和帮助。（新华社）
