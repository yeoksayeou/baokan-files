Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Rehe Province: In order to create conditions for increased production next year, farmers in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Rehe Province have advanced autumn plowing. Currently, over seven million mu of wheat stubble land in Inner Mongolia has been basically plowed, and they are vigorously launching a campaign to plow the autumn stubble land. This year, encouraged by the "Three Fixes" policy for grain, farmers in Inner Mongolia have been particularly enthusiastic about production. Generally, all areas started autumn plowing early and acted quickly. Last year, in the Hetao and Pingdiquan Administrative Regions and the Ulanqab League, 75 percent of the wheat stubble fields were plowed by October 25th. This year, 80 percent was plowed by mid-October. In the Chahar League, half of the total area was plowed by the time of the freeze last year. This year, about 75 percent had been plowed by October 13th.

According to statistics from ten counties and banners in Rehe Province as of October 20th, a total of more than 217,000 hectares have been plowed, accounting for 40 percent of the plowable area. It is expected that by early November, more than 80 percent of the plowable land in the province will have been autumn plowed, which is about 10 percent more than the area autumn plowed last year.

    内蒙古自治区和热河省提早进行秋翻地
    内蒙古自治区和热河省农民为了给明年增产创造条件，提早进行了秋翻地。目前，内蒙古全区七百多万亩麦槎地业已基本翻完，正大力突击秋槎地。今年，内蒙古农民在粮食“三定”政策的鼓舞下，生产情绪特别高，各地对秋翻地一般都动手早，行动快。去年河套、平地泉行政区和乌兰察布盟到十月二十五日，翻耕了百分之七十五的麦槎田，今年在十月中旬就翻耕了百分之八十。察哈尔盟去年到封冻共翻总面积的一半，今年至十月十三日就翻过百分之七十五左右。
    热河省据十个县、旗到十月二十日的统计，共已翻地二十一万七千多垧，占可翻地面积的百分之四十。预计到十一月上旬，全省百分之八十以上的可翻地都将进行秋翻，可比去年秋翻地面积扩大百分之十左右。
