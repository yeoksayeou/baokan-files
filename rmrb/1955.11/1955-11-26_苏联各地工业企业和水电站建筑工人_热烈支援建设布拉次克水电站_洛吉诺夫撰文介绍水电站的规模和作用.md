Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd - Industrial enterprises and hydropower station construction workers across the Soviet Union are enthusiastically supporting the construction of the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station project.

Machines and building materials are continuously being transported from every corner of the Soviet Union to the construction site. At the first and second stations of the construction site's railway branch line, an average of seventy to eighty carriages of materials are unloaded every 24 hours. On the highways, convoys of trucks are also running continuously, transporting the necessary equipment. Currently, the first batch of powerful excavators manufactured by the Ural Machine Factory, cars manufactured by automobile factories in Moscow, Minsk, and other places, and tractors produced in factories in Chelyabinsk have appeared on the construction site.

Many experienced workers have come to the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station construction site from the construction sites of the Kama, Kakhovka, and Gorky hydroelectric stations to participate in the glorious task of taming the Angara River.

Currently, workers on the construction site are competing to greet the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and have decided to complete this year's construction plan ahead of schedule before December 25.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 25th - "Pravda" published an article on the 24th written by Loginov, Minister of Power Station Construction of the Soviet Union, entitled "Building the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station on the Angara River is a Cause for the Whole People," introducing the scale and role of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station.

The article wrote that the generating capacity of the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station exceeds three million kilowatts, and its power generation is approximately equal to the sum of the power generation of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station and the Stalingrad Hydroelectric Station. The construction of this hydroelectric station will lay the foundation for the comprehensive development of industry in eastern and western Siberia. The article pointed out that the Angara River originates from Lake Baikal and flows into the Yenisei River, with a total length of more than 1,800 kilometers and a drop of approximately 380 meters from the source to the mouth of the river. Due to the large drop of the river and the sufficient water volume, it is estimated that the total power generation of the hydroelectric stations that can be built on the Angara River will reach 65 billion kilowatt-hours per year. It can also make the entire Angara River navigable.

The Bratsk Hydroelectric Station is built in the turbulent waters north of Bratsk Village. The Angara River is only about one kilometer wide here, and the banks are as high as 80 to 90 meters. The river banks and riverbeds are solid diabase, which can serve as a reliable foundation for the giant construction project of the hydraulic hub.

The area of the hydroelectric station's reservoir will reach approximately 5,300 square kilometers, with a storage capacity of 180 billion cubic meters, exceeding the storage capacity of the Kuibyshev artificial reservoir by 2.5 times. Because the flow of the Angara River is very uniform, although the generating capacity of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station only exceeds the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station by 50 percent, the annual power generation will exceed the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station by more than one time.

The article continued that the amount of concrete and reinforced concrete used in the hydroelectric station will reach 9 million cubic meters, which also exceeds the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station. At the same time, the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station is built in sparsely populated forest areas, far away from residential areas and industrial centers. Therefore, in order to complete the construction of this hydroelectric station in a short period of time, it is also necessary to establish a strong production base in this area, build cities, construct hundreds of kilometers of railways and highways, and erect a 650-kilometer transmission line from the Irkutsk Hydroelectric Station to the construction site.

Currently, the preparatory work for the construction project has begun. Nearly 6,000 construction workers have arrived at the construction site. The highway has been built. The temporary transmission line from Bratsk Village to the construction site has also been erected. Residential areas, railways, and other auxiliary enterprises are under construction. The article finally said that the task put forward by the Party and the government—to generate electricity with the first batch of generator sets of the Bratsk Hydroelectric Station in 1960—is complex, but it is entirely possible to complete.

    据新华社莫斯科二十三日电　苏联各地的工业企业和水电站的建筑工人，都热烈地支援世界最大的布拉次克水电站的建筑工程。
    机器和建筑材料正从苏联各个角落源源不绝地运到工地上来。在工地铁路支线的第一和第二车站上，平均每昼夜要卸下七十到八十车厢的物资。在公路上，运货汽车的队伍，也连续不断地奔驰着，把需要的器材运来。目前，工地上已经出现了乌拉尔机器工厂制造的第一批强大的掘土机，莫斯科、明斯克等地汽车工厂制造的汽车，和车里雅宾斯克的工厂中出产的拖拉机。
    许多有经验的工作人员，已经从卡马、卡霍夫卡、高尔基等水电站的工地上来到了布拉次克水电站工地，参加驯服安加拉河的光荣事业。
  现在，工地上的工人为了迎接苏联共产党第二十次代表大会，正在进行竞赛，决定在十二月二十五日以前提前完成今年的建筑计划。
    新华社莫斯科二十五日电　“真理报”二十四日发表苏联电站建设部部长洛吉诺夫写的“建设安加拉河上的布拉次克水电站是全民的事业”一文，介绍布拉次克水电站的规模和作用。
    文章写道，世界上最大的布拉次克水电站的发电能力超过三百万瓩，它的发电量约等于古比雪夫水电站和斯大林格勒水电站发电量的总和。建设这个水电站，将为全面发展东西伯利亚地区的工业打下基础。文章指出，安加拉河发源于贝加尔湖，流入叶尼塞河，全长一千八百多公里，从河源到河口的落差约三百八十公尺。由于河的落差较大和水量充足，因此预计可以在安加拉河上建筑的各水电站的总发电量，每年将达到六百五十亿瓩时。并且还可以使安加拉河全程通航。
    布拉次克水电站建筑在布拉次克村以北的水流湍急的地方。安加拉河在这里只有约一公里宽，两岸高达八十到九十公尺。河岸和河床是牢固的辉绿岩，可以作为水力枢纽巨型建筑工程的可靠基础。
    水电站水库的面积将达五千三百平方公里左右，蓄水量达一千八百亿立方公尺，超过古比雪夫人工水库蓄水量二点五倍。由于安加拉河的流量非常均匀，布拉次克水电站的发电能力虽然只超过古比雪夫水电站百分之五十，但全年的发电量却将超过古比雪夫水电站一倍以上。
    文章接着说，水电站的混凝土和钢筋混凝土工程量将达九百万公方，也超过了古比雪夫水电站。同时，布拉次克水电站建筑在人口稀少的丛林区域，远离居民区和工业中心。因此为了在短期内完成这个水电站的建筑工程，还必须在这个地区内建立强大的生产基地，建设城市，修筑数百公里长的铁路线和公路线，架设由伊尔库次克水电站到工地的六百五十公里长的输电线。
    目前，建筑工程的准备工作已经展开了。已经有将近六千个建筑工人到达工地。公路线已经修好。从布拉次克村到工地的临时输电线也已经架设完成。住宅区、铁路和其他的一些辅助企业正在兴建中。文章最后说，党和政府所提出的任务——在一九六零年使布拉次克水电站第一批联动机发电的任务是复杂的，但是，是完全可以完成的。
