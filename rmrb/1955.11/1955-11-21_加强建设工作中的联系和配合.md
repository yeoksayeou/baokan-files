Strengthening Connections and Coordination in Construction Work

To the Editor:

　　Some industrial construction units, due to a lack of contact with each other, have repeatedly constructed similar engineering projects, resulting in serious waste. For example, in Jilin City, there are two factories led by the Ministry of Heavy Industry. These two factories are only separated by a wire fence, but they each designed their own water supply, drainage, and gas supply equipment, and each has a highly automated boiler room and coal supply and ash removal equipment. Obviously, if they had communicated with each other before construction, the two units could have shared a set of equipment entirely. For example, in another industrial area of ​​Jilin, several factories of the same type are concentrated together, but each factory has its own machine repair workshop and electrical repair workshop. One factory has complete equipment in the casting, forging, machinery, and assembly sections that have already been built, and the scale is very large, but another factory next door wants to build a new machine repair workshop; however, after this factory is put into production, the workload in machine repair is not large and can be entirely undertaken by the neighboring factory's machine repair workshop.

　　There are also cases where losses are caused by a lack of good coordination between urban planning and industrial construction. For example, there are two newly developed industrial zones in Jilin City, which are only separated by the Songhua River. However, the bridge connecting these two industrial zones and serving the factory construction project only started construction when the factory construction project was halfway through and is expected to be completed in July or August next year. Before the bridge is built, many factory construction materials must be detoured by more than 30 kilometers during transportation, costing an extra six or seven yuan per ton in freight. The main roads and railways in these two industrial zones were also not built before the start of the factory construction project, which added many difficulties to the material transportation work. Why do these problems occur? Because the investment in bridge and road construction is applied for by the municipal system to the state, and the factory construction investment is applied for by the various industrial departments.

　　The lack of unified planning in construction and the disconnection of work between several departments will not only cause waste of state funds, but also delay the speed of industrial construction. This phenomenon is not uncommon. The above are just a few examples from Jilin. It is hoped that relevant leading departments will learn from these lessons, strengthen contacts with all parties in future work, and prevent similar phenomena from continuing to occur.

### 加强建设工作中的联系和配合

　　加强建设工作中的联系和配合编辑同志：
    有些工业建设单位由于相互之间缺少联系，以致重复地建设同类的工程项目，造成了严重的浪费。例如，吉林市有重工业部领导的两个工厂。这两个厂只隔一道铁丝网，但是却各自设计一套供水、下水和煤气供应设备，各有一个自动化程度很高的锅炉房和供煤、出灰设备。显然，只要建设以前互相通一通声气，两个单位完全可以合用一套设备的。又如，吉林的另一个工区，好几个同类型的工厂集中在一起，可是各厂都设有机修车间和电修车间。一个工厂已建成的铸工、锻工、机械、装配等工段的设备都很齐全，规模也很大，但是旁边另一个工厂还要新建机修车间；而这个厂投入生产以后，机修方面的工作量并不大，完全可以由邻厂的机修车间担负起来。
    在城市规划和工业建设之间，也有着由于互相没有很好地配合而造成损失的情况。例如，吉林市有两个新开辟的工业区，这两个区只隔一条松花江。但是，连接这两个工业区、为建厂工程服务的大桥，在建厂工程进行了一半的时候才开工兴建，估计要明年七、八月才能竣工。在大桥没有建好以前，许多建厂材料在运输中必须绕道三十多公里，每吨要多花运费六、七元。这两个工业区的主要公路和铁路，也没有在建厂工程开工之前修好，因此给材料运输工作增加了许多困难。为什么会发生这些问题呢？因为修桥、修路的投资是市政系统向国家申请的，工厂的建设投资是由各工业部门申请的。
    建设中缺乏统一规划，几个部门的工作彼此脱节，不但会造成国家资金的浪费，而且会推迟工业建设的速度。这种现象是不少的。以上举的只是吉林一地的几个例子。希望有关领导部门吸取这些教训，在今后工作中同各方面加强联系，不要使类似现象继续出现。
