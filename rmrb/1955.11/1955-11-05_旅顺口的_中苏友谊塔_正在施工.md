Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, November 4th: The "Sino-Soviet Friendship Tower," which the State Council decided to build in Lushunkou, is under construction.

The famous fine stone workers in the tower construction team were mostly transferred from Jinan, Wendeng, Yexian, Changchun, Shenyang and other places. They quickly completed the foundation project with high labor enthusiasm and are now building the first layer of the tower base. Teachers and students from the Northeast Academy of Fine Arts, who are responsible for creating the bas-reliefs on the tower, have established a sculpture group to begin the creation. The Beijing Hardware Cooperative, with its exquisite craftsmanship, is also starting to manufacture the Sino-Soviet friendship emblem on the top of the tower.

Since the groundbreaking ceremony of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Tower on February 23 this year, preparations for the tower construction have been underway for nearly eight months. During the preparation work, the tower construction committee, composed of specialized engineers and artists, received personal guidance from Xiao Hua, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Du Zheheng, Governor of Liaoning Province, and the responsible persons of the Dalian municipal party and government. They selected the best one from seven different tower design plans and submitted it to the State Council for approval before construction began. When completed, the tower will be 22 meters high. The top of the tower will be adorned with the Sino-Soviet friendship emblem, symbolizing the eternal friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union. The tower will be dodecagonal, and the upper part will be carved with snowflakes made of alabaster from Yexian County, Shandong Province, symbolizing that the profound friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people will blossom forever like flowers; the lower part will be carved with group portraits of the Chinese and Soviet people using the same stone. The four sides of the tower base will be inlaid with bas-reliefs representing Sino-Soviet friendship, and on both sides of the bas-reliefs, victory flags will be carved from light red granite produced in Qingdao, to show that the unbreakable unity of the Chinese and Soviet people guarantees victory after victory. The tower inscription stone will be located in the center of the second layer of the tower base, and its sides will be decorated with stone carvings of peace doves.

    旅顺口的“中苏友谊塔”正在施工
    新华社旅大四日电　国务院决定在旅顺口兴建的“中苏友谊塔”正在施工。
    建塔工程队中的著名细石工人大部分是从济南、文登、掖南、长春、沈阳等地调来的。他们都以高度的劳动热情迅速完成了塔基工程，现正在建设第一层塔座。负责创作塔上浮雕的画面的东北美术专科学校的师生们，已专门成立雕塑小组，开始创作。工艺精巧的北京五金合作社，也正着手制造塔尖上的中苏友好徽。
    中苏友谊塔自今年二月二十三日举行奠基典礼以来，建塔准备工作进行了将近八个月。由专门的工程师和艺术工作者组成的建塔委员会在准备工作中，曾得到中国人民解放军总政治部副主任萧华、辽宁省省长杜者衡以及旅大市党政负责人的亲临指导。他们从七种不同的建塔设计方案中，挑选出最好的一种，呈经国务院批准后才施工。这个塔建成后，塔高二十二公尺。塔尖将安设标志着中苏两国人民永恒友谊的中苏友好徽。塔呈十二角形，上部将用山东掖南县出产的雪花石雕成花朵，象征中苏两国人民的深厚友谊好像鲜花一样地永远盛开；下部用同样的石料雕成中苏两国人民的群像。塔座的四面将嵌饰表示中苏友谊的浮雕，浮雕两旁并将用青岛出产的浅红色花岗石雕成胜利旗帜，以表示中苏两国人民的牢不可破的团结保证由胜利走向胜利。塔铭石将设在第二层塔座的中央，它的两侧将装饰和平鸽石雕。
