Britain Should Not Occupy the Buraimi Oasis
Cui Qi
On October 26th, troops of the Sultanate of Oman, led by British officers, occupied the Buraimi Oasis in the border area between Oman and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has filed a complaint with the United Nations Security Council, accusing Britain's actions of being an act of aggression.
The British government claims that it took this action because
  “there was no other way” to fulfill its “obligations” and “help its friends”. However, no matter what Britain says, this area should not be occupied by Britain. The facts show that Britain's desire to seize the Buraimi Oasis is only because it smelled the scent of oil in this area.
The Buraimi Oasis is located in the eastern part of the Arabian Peninsula and covers an area of ​​several thousand square miles. According to Western news agencies, abundant oil resources have been discovered here in recent years, arousing the covetousness of some Western countries. Because Oman and Saudi Arabia have never had a clear border in this area, Britain has taken advantage of this situation to appear as Oman’s “protectorate” and “ally” and wants to occupy the oasis for itself. For many years, British troops have continuously invaded the Buraimi Oasis, clashed with the Saudi Arabian authorities, and attempted to force Saudi Arabia to recognize Britain’s colonial privileges over this oasis. When Britain discovered that it could not achieve its goal by this intimidating method, it brazenly carried out armed occupation.
Britain's illegal actions have clearly infringed upon the interests of Saudi Arabia. A spokesman for the Saudi Arabian government said long ago: "Whether or not there is oil, it must never affect Saudi Arabia's historical and legal rights in the Buraimi Oasis." Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faisal Al Saud pointed out on October 27 that Britain’s actions “undermined international law and international principles.” Therefore, Saudi Arabia will never recognize Britain’s occupation of this area.
Saudi Arabia has always advocated resolving the Buraimi dispute through peaceful means. As early as June 1954, it suggested sending a delegation to the area to investigate the facts. Later, Saudi Arabia reached an agreement with Britain to submit the dispute to international arbitration. However, when Britain felt that the International Court of Justice was not acting in accordance with its colonial interests, it declared its withdrawal from the court on the pretext that Saudi Arabia was "biased." Facts have proved that Britain has no sincerity in peaceful consultation, but is deliberately using force. This practice cannot but be condemned by international public opinion. The Buraimi Oasis dispute should still be resolved reasonably through peaceful consultation, while respecting Saudi Arabia's sovereignty and interests.

    英国不应该侵占布赖米绿洲
    崔奇
    十月二十六日，由英国军官率领的阿曼酋长国军队占领了阿曼和沙特阿拉伯边境地区的布赖米绿洲。沙特阿拉伯已经向联合国安全理事会提出控诉，指责英国的行动是侵略行为。
    英国政府宣称，它所以采取这种行动，是因为
  “别无其他办法”来履行它的“义务”和“帮助英国的朋友”。可是，不论英国怎么样说，这块地方是不应该由英国占领的。事实说明，英国要争夺布赖米绿洲，只是由于它嗅到了这个地区的石油气息。
    布赖米绿洲位于阿拉伯半岛东部，面积有几千方英里。据西方通讯社报道，近年来在这里发现了丰饶的石油资源，引起一些西方国家的垂涎。由于阿曼和沙特阿拉伯在这个地区一直没有明确的边界，所以英国就利用这种情况，以阿曼的“保护国”和“盟友”的身份出现，想把绿洲占为己有。多年以来，英国军队曾不断地侵入布赖米绿洲，和沙特阿拉伯当局发生冲突，企图压迫沙特阿拉伯承认英国对这块绿洲的殖民特权。当英国发现用这种威吓的方式不能达到目的时，它竟公然实行武装占领。
    英国的这种非法行动，显然侵犯了沙特阿拉伯的利益。沙特阿拉伯政府发言人早就说过：“无论有没有石油，都决不能影响沙特阿拉伯在布赖米绿洲的历史的和法律的权利。”沙特阿拉伯首相兼外交大臣费萨尔·沙特在十月二十七日指出，英国的行动“破坏了国际法和国际原则”。因此，沙特阿拉伯决不能承认英国对这个地区的占领。
    沙特阿拉伯一直主张用和平方法解决布赖米争端。还在一九五四年六月，它就曾建议派遣一个代表团到那个地区去，调查事实真相。后来，沙特阿拉伯又和英国取得协议，把这个争端提交国际仲裁。但是，当英国感到国际法庭没有按照它的殖民利益行事时，它就借口沙特阿拉伯有“偏见”，宣布退出法庭。事实证明，英国对和平协商没有诚意，而是蓄意使用武力的。这种做法不能不受到国际舆论的谴责。布赖米绿洲的争端，还是应该用和平协商方式，在尊重沙特阿拉伯主权和利益的条件下，加以合理解决。
