　　Transforming Scattered and Backward Woolen Mills into Comprehensive Factories
　　Cheng Ying
　　Shanghai's woolen textile industry accounts for about 70 percent of the country's woolen textile production equipment, with a total of 60 factories, including 53 private factories. Products include worsted fabrics, woolen fabrics, yarn, plush, industrial felts, and industrial wool, etc. These products are not only needed domestically, but are also exported in large quantities to the Soviet Union and other People's Democratic countries, in exchange for industrial equipment for national construction.

　　Among the 53 private factories, most are non-comprehensive factories that only spin, weave, or dye, with outdated machinery, simple equipment, and extremely unbalanced production processes. The production of these factories relies on continuous processing between private entities, but production cannot be coordinated, processed products are often delayed, product quality cannot be guaranteed, and raw materials are seriously wasted. Taking camel hair production as an example, the camel hair produced by Shencheng Woolen Mill requires eight processes, but the factory only has half a circular knitting machine and can only do one process. The yarn is supplied by Dagong Woolen Mill, woven into camel hair, and then sent to Huaxiang Woolen Mill for napping, and finally to Tianxiang Woolen Mill for dyeing and finishing. These factories are located in three districts far apart, requiring a round trip of about 70 *huali*, resulting in a great waste of manpower and materials. The main reason for the unbalanced production equipment in Shanghai's woolen textile industry is that during the Japanese imperialist occupation and the Kuomintang reactionary rule, currency depreciated, and some capitalists saw that woolen mills required less investment, had faster capital turnover, and higher profits, so they invested in the woolen textile industry. Some had no factory buildings at all and only bought yarn to entrust others to weave; others put up the signboard of a woolen spinning, weaving, dyeing and finishing co., but in fact only had a few weaving machines.

　　After the implementation of processing orders in 1953, the woolen textile industry was initially brought into the orbit of the national plan. However, due to the scattered and backward production equipment, many factories have outdated machinery, insufficient technical strength, and cannot produce high-end products; in addition, the relations of production have not changed, management is corrupt, and the enthusiasm of workers cannot be brought into play. If this situation is not changed, it will not only affect the completion of the country's export tasks, but also fail to meet the growing needs of the people.

　　To change the current situation of Shanghai's private woolen textile industry, it is necessary to conduct industry-wide planning and reorganize the scattered and backward factories with unbalanced equipment into comprehensive factories, which can then further carry out the socialist transformation of the woolen textile industry.

　　Conducting industry-wide reorganization and merger planning is a very complicated task. Among the 53 private factories, there are eight types of factories with different products, including large and small factories, advanced and backward machinery and equipment, good and bad operating conditions, some sole proprietorships, some partnerships, and some joint-stock companies. In the process of brewing industry-wide public-private partnership, the capitalists' ideological situation is also very chaotic. Some want to engage in individual joint ventures, some require merged joint ventures, those who have changed careers want to return to the industry, those who cross industries want to link up, and those who have suspended operations want to squeeze in. Therefore, reorganization and merger must be combined with production needs, uniformly planned, comprehensively arranged, and carried out under leadership and in a planned way.

　　Under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Municipal People's Government, the capitalists were first mobilized to implement public-private partnerships throughout the industry. At the same time, the core members of the Woolen Textile Industry Association organized a working group to launch industry-wide study and discussion. Many capitalists were very excited to hear the mobilization report on public-private partnership throughout the industry, but their opinions on enterprise joint ventures combined with reorganization and production restructuring were extremely inconsistent. This situation was initially concentrated in the Trade Association working group of representatives of large factories. For example, Chen Yuanqin, a capitalist from China Woolen Mill, emphasized voluntariness, believing that he "operated independently, had a lot of capital, good machinery, a long history, an old brand, and good sales channels," and disliked small factories for "outdated machinery, lack of funds, poor management, and poor quality," fearing that merging with small factories would not be worthwhile. They only considered that after individual joint ventures, production tasks could be increased and profits could also be increased. Therefore, they "welcome joint ventures, but do not approve of mergers." Some people also worried that merged joint ventures would be difficult to promote, and it would be difficult to match large and small factories, so it would be better to take the simple method of "large joint ventures." Some small factories with incomplete equipment, unable to carry out independent production, with many difficulties, and had the idea of merged joint ventures, but always felt that their production was poor and their funds were small, fearing that others would not want them; and feared that "big fish would eat small fish," so it would be best to choose a "well-matched" partner, otherwise they would not want to merge into a large factory.

　　Based on the above situation, to do a good job in merged joint ventures, it is necessary to persuade large factories to take the lead actively and mobilize small factories to strive actively, and obtaining the initiative of large factories is the main link in the work. Large factories have more complete production equipment and more comprehensive management, while small factories are scattered and backward. Reorganization should be concentrated in large factories. If large factories can be active and take the initiative, small factories can dispel ideological concerns. Through organizing study, clarifying the necessity of realizing socialist transformation, and at the same time, through examining the decadent and backward roots of capitalist management in the past, recognizing that industry-wide joint ventures must be combined with production reorganization. After repeated discussions, exposing problems, encouraging advanced elements, and persuading backward elements, some large factory capitalists also criticized the erroneous idea of not starting from the socialist transformation of the entire industry and only considering their own immediate interests. In the process of discussion, Zhanghua Woolen Mill first expressed its willingness to merge into small factories, and the capitalists of Huitong Woolen Mill also had plans to merge with six companies including Xinhua, Zhengda, Dacheng, Daguangming, and Laohengchang, taking the lead. After brewing to maturity, the factories were then discussed in groups according to product types to specifically solve the matching problem of "reasonable mergers and private voluntariness." According to the characteristics of the industry and the needs of production development, the main principles of reorganization and merger were negotiated and determined, and the factories were organized into comprehensive factories according to product types. Factories with a small scope of operation, simple and outdated equipment, unable to maintain production independently, or with the necessity and possibility of merging factories, should adopt the method of "large leading small, advanced leading backward" for reorganization; the factories to be merged must be larger in scale and able to accommodate the merged personnel, tasks, be located in nearby areas, and, in principle, not cost money or cost less money.

　　In the specific negotiation process, some large factory capitalists took the initiative to contact small factories, making the small factories happy to accept. For example, Xiexin looked for Dacheng, Yinfeng looked for Dalu, Yuanfeng looked for Dadong, and Jingyi and China also looked for Jinhua to merge. Shen Laizhou, a capitalist at Hengfeng, persuaded his son, Shen Jicheng, to merge into Yumin. Among them, only Hailong's capitalists were not very enthusiastic, always dodging and not actively contacting small factories, delaying the progress of the work. Except for three factories with special products that adopted individual joint ventures, the woolen textile industry all adopted the "merged joint venture" method.

　　In the merged joint venture, two different methods were adopted according to the specific situation of the merged objects. One is "merging shares, merging people, and merging tasks," such as the merger of Xiexin and Dacheng. In principle, the machines are not dismantled, the excess equipment is stored, and can be organized for relocation in the future. The excess factory buildings can be used as staff dormitories or warehouses. The second is to combine "merging shares without merging factories" with "rational organization of production," such as linking Weilun and Minhe two weaving factories with Weiyi spinning factory and Wuchang dyeing and finishing factory, becoming three units, maintaining production at the original site, and forming a comprehensive factory. Another example is that Huitong, Daguangming, Laohengchang, Weixin, and Da Shanghai five factories were merged into two units, forming a comprehensive factory. Among them, all the machines of the Da Shanghai factory were dismantled and relocated, which only cost about 500 yuan. In terms of economic types, in addition to private-private mergers, two methods were also adopted: the first method was private factories merged into joint venture factories. The second method was joint venture factories merged into private factories, making business management more professional.

　　Merging shares, merging people, and merging tasks is a major event in the process of merged joint ventures. To make dozens of factories and thousands of workers scattered throughout the city migrate and reorganize separately, without affecting production and without spending much money, it is necessary to make full preparations under the leadership of the public sector, the responsibility of the private sector, the initiative of the large factories, and the cooperation of the small factories.

　　Formulate a factory merger work plan for the merged joint venture units, do a good job in ideological mobilization, uniformly arrange production tasks, solve private financial problems, and properly arrange the lives, welfare, and work positions of employees. In order to ensure that it is beneficial to production, the merged personnel should first merge production workers and then merge staff. The machine repair team leader should go to the factory to be merged for a trial run, become familiar with the situation, and then lead the workers to get on the bus for production in an orderly manner. All factories that do this can ensure stable emotions and uninterrupted production. At the same time, property inventory and share determination were carried out, and appropriate arrangements were also made for various personnel matters.

　　After industry-wide planning and merged joint ventures, the 53 private woolen mills were basically merged into 19 factories with comprehensive production equipment for spinning, weaving, and dyeing.

　　After the enterprise joint venture, the economic and technical reorganization has shown its superiority in all aspects. For example, Maoxin and Hengfeng factories with outdated equipment and low output, and Yumin and Anle factories with good equipment and high output produced 100,000 *shijin* of yarn in the month before the merger, requiring 2,668 yarn spindles. After merging into Yumin Factory, only 1,800 yarn spindles are needed to complete the task. After the dyeing department of Yumin Woolen Mill was merged, technical personnel were added, and various blended yarn colors have been initially trial-dyed. In the third quarter of this year, the pass rate of woolen fabrics in private factories was only 50% to 60%. After the merger in October, the pass rate of woolen fabrics has risen to 96.89%. In terms of business management, the unreasonable phenomenon of scattered backwardness and round-trip processing in the past has also been overcome. For example, after the merger of seven camel hair factories including Tianxiang, they can basically spin, weave, and dye themselves, saving management costs and reducing costs. In particular, after the nature of the enterprise changed, the workers' labor enthusiasm was greatly increased. The workers in the worsted spinning department of Yinfeng Woolen Mill originally only looked after 200 spindles per person. In October, they visited the No. 2 and No. 3 State-owned Woolen Mills, learned the cleaning work and patrol work methods, and took the initiative to ask to learn from the workers of the state-owned woolen mills and add 200 spindles per person. The administration approved their request, and some people took the initiative to increase the number of spindles they were looking after. The workers in the weaving machine department of Yuanfeng Woolen Mill originally looked after one weaving machine per person. Now one person can look after two. After merged production, there was a surplus of houses. Not only has the working conditions in the workshop been improved, but the number of dormitories has increased. Many factories are also preparing to set up workers' recreation rooms or workers' clubs, and employee benefits have also been improved.

　　After the merged joint venture, the capitalists, under the leadership of the public sector representatives and the supervision of the masses of employees, have also improved their enthusiasm for production. For example, some capitalists at Yumin Woolen Mill did not often go to the factory in the past, but now they go to the factory every day and suggest going to and from work on time. Xu Qinyu, a capitalist from Jingyi Woolen Mill, also participated in the production planning meeting after merging into Yuanfeng Woolen Mill, expressing his intention to transform himself.

　　Although the 53 private factories have been merged and jointly operated, the management of these factories needs to be improved urgently, and the capitalists and agents of the enterprises still need to be transformed. In order to strengthen leadership, comprehensively plan, ensure the completion of national plans, and implement dual transformation, the state-owned Shanghai Wool and Linen Textile Company has been established on the basis of the merged joint venture to lead these factories, which provides favorable conditions for unified deployment of production tasks, unified allocation of labor, organization of technical forces, improvement of quality, reduction of costs, and gradual improvement of enterprise management in the future.

　　把分散落后的毛纺织厂改造成为全能厂
　　程譍
    上海毛纺工业的生产设备，约占全国毛纺工业生产设备的百分之七十，共有六十个厂，其中私营厂有五十三个，产品有精纺织品、粗纺织品、绒线、长毛绒、工业用呢、工业用毡等。这些产品不但国内需要，而且还向苏联及人民民主国家大量输出，换回国家建设的工业器材。
    在五十三家私营工厂中，大部分是单纺、单织或单染整的非全能厂，机器陈旧、设备简陋，生产工序极不平衡。这些厂的生产，要依靠私私之间连续加工，而私私之间生产不能协调，加工产品往往误期、产品质量无法保证、原料材料浪费严重。以骆驼绒生产为例，慎诚毛织厂所生产的骆驼绒共需八道工艺过程，而该厂仅有半台圆织机，只能做一道工艺过程，其中毛纱由大公毛纺织厂供给，织成骆驼绒后再送到华翔毛织厂去拉毛，最后还要送到天翔毛纺织厂去染整。这些厂分布在相距很远的三个区里，往返一次约需七十华里，造成人力物力上很大浪费。造成上海毛纺工业生产设备不平衡的主要原因，是由于在日本帝国主义占领期间和国民党反动统治时期货币贬值，一些资本家看到毛织厂投资少、资金周转快、利润大，便把毛纺工业作为投资对象。有的根本没有厂房，只买些毛纱委托代织；也有的挂起毛绒纺织染整股份有限公司的招牌，其实仅有数台织机。
    一九五三年实行加工订货后，毛纺业全业初步纳入国家计划的轨道。但由于生产设备分散落后，许多工厂机器陈旧，技术力量不足，不能生产高级产品；再加上生产关系没有改变，经营管理腐败，工人积极性不能发挥。如不改变这种情况，不但影响国家出口任务的完成，而且不能满足人民日益增长的需要。
    要改变上海私营毛纺工业的现状，必须进行全业规划，把分散落后、设备不平衡的工厂通过裁并，基本上都组成为全能厂，才能进一步进行对毛纺业的社会主义改造。
    进行全行业裁并改合的规划，是一件十分复杂的工作。五十三家私营工厂中，有八种产品不同类型的工厂，其中大厂和小厂，机器设备有先进和落后，经营情况有好有坏，有的独资，有的合伙，有的是股份有限公司。在酝酿整个行业实行公私合营中，资本家的思想情况也很混乱。有的想单独合营，有的要求合并合营，已转业的想转回本行业，跨行业的想挂钩，停业的想挨进。因此裁并改合必须结合生产需要统一规划、全面安排，有领导有计划地进行。
    在中共上海市委及市人民委员会的领导下，首先对资本家进行整个行业实行公私合营的动员，同时并通过毛纺织业同业公会的骨干分子组织工作组，展开全业的学习讨论。不少资本家听到整个行业实行公私合营的动员报告，都大为兴奋，但对企业合营结合裁并改合生产改组的意见极不一致。这一情况一开始就集中反映在大厂代表人物的同业公会工作组里。如中国毛绒厂资本家陈元钦强调自愿，认为自己“独资经营，资金多，机器好，历史长，牌子老，销路好”，嫌小厂“机器陈旧，资金短少，管理不善，质量不好”，怕同小厂合并不合算。他们只考虑单独合营后，生产任务可以加多，利润也可以增多。因此，“欢迎合营，不赞成合并”。也有人顾虑合并合营很难推动，大厂、小厂难于搭配，不如采取“大合营”的简单办法。还有些小厂设备不全，不能进行独立生产，困难多，曾经有过合并合营的想法，但总觉得自己生产差，资金少，怕人家不要；又怕“大鱼吃小鱼”，最好选个“门当户对”，否则不愿并到大厂去。
    根据以上情况，要做好合并合营工作，必须说服大厂主动带头，动员小厂积极争取，而取得大厂主动是工作的主要环节。大厂生产设备比较完整，经营管理比较全面，小厂分散落后，裁并就要向大厂集中，大厂如能积极主动，小厂即可解除思想顾虑。通过组织学习，明确实现社会主义改造的必要性，同时经过检查过去资本主义的经营管理的腐朽落后的根源，认识全行业合营必需与生产改组相结合。这样经过反复讨论，暴露问题、鼓励先进、说服落后，有些大厂资本家也批判了不从全业社会主义改造的观点出发，只考虑自己眼前利益的错误思想。在讨论过程中，合营章华毛纺织厂首先表示愿意并进小厂，汇通毛纺织厂资本家也有过与新华、正大、大成、大光明、老恒昌等六家合并合营的打算，起了带头作用。在酝酿成熟后，又按照产品类型分组讨论，具体解决“合并合理、私私自愿”的搭配问题，根据行业特点及生产发展需要，协商确定了裁并改合的主要原则，按产品类型组织各厂成为全能厂。企业范围较小、设备简陋陈旧、不能单独维持生产或有并厂必要与可能的，采取“大带小，先进带落后”的办法，予以裁并；受并的厂，必须规模较大，能容纳并入人员、任务、地区邻近，以及原则上不花钱或少花钱等条件来进行合并工作。
    在具体协商过程中，有些大厂资本家采取主动联系小厂的办法，使小厂乐于接受。如协新找大成、寅丰找大陆、元丰找大东、精益、中国也去找金华合并。恒丰资本家沈莱舟说服了儿子沈辑丞并进裕民。其中只有海龙资本家积极性不高，始终躲躲闪闪不主动与小厂联系，推迟了工作进展。毛纺业除有三个厂因产品特殊、采取单独合营外，其余全部采取“合并合营”方式。
    在合并合营中，又根据合并对象的具体情况，采取两种不同的办法，一种是“并股、并人、并任务”，如协新与大成合并等，原则上机器不拆迁，多余的设备保管，将来可组织内迁，多余的厂房可以利用，作为职工宿舍或仓库等。第二种是“并股不并厂”与“合理组织生产”结合起来，如纬纶、民和两织厂与唯一纺厂、五昌染整厂加以联并，成为三个单位，保持原址生产，联成一个全能厂。又如汇通、大光明、老恒昌、维新、大上海五厂并为两个单位，联成一个全能厂。其中大上海厂全部机器拆迁，也只花了约五百元。在经济类型上除采取私私合并外，又采取了二种办法：第一种私营厂并入合营厂。第二种合营厂并入私营厂，使经营管理专业化。
    并股并人并任务是合并合营过程中的一件大事情，要使分散全市的几十个厂几千个职工分别迁移组合，要不影响生产，又要不多花钱，必须在公方领导，私方负责，大厂主动，小厂配合下，做好充分的准备工作。
    以合并合营单位制定并厂工作计划，做好思想动员，统一布置生产任务，解决私私财务问题，妥善安排职工生活福利及工作岗位。为了保证对生产有利，合并人员要先并生产工人后并职员，机匠组长要到受并厂试行校车，熟悉情况，然后带领工人按部就班上车生产。凡是这样做的厂，都能保证了情绪稳定、生产不乱。在此同时进行了清产定股工作，对各项人事也作了适当的安排。
    经过全业规划、合并合营后，就把五十三个私营毛纺织厂基本上合并为具有纺、织、染全能生产设备的十九个厂。
    企业合营后，经过经济和技术的改组，在各方面已显示出优越性。如设备陈旧、产量低的茂新、恒丰厂和设备好、产量高的裕民、安乐厂在合并前一个月生产十万市斤绒线，需开绒线锭二千六百六十八枚，并入裕民厂后只需开绒线锭一千八百枚即可完成任务。裕民毛纺厂染部合并后，增加了技术人员，目前已初步试染了多种混纺绒线颜色。今年三季度私营厂的呢绒正品率只有百分之五十到六十，十月份合并后呢绒的正品率已升到百分之九十六点八九。在经营管理上，也克服了过去分散落后、往返加工的不合理现象。如天翔等七个骆驼绒厂经过合并后，基本上可以自纺、自织、自染，节省了管理费用，降低了成本。特别是企业性质改变以后，工人的劳动热情大大提高。寅丰毛纺厂精纺部工人，原来每人只看两百只锭子，十月间去国营第二、第三毛纺厂参观，学习了清洁工作和巡回工作法以后，主动要求向国营毛纺厂工人学习，每人再增加二百只锭子，行政上批准了他们的要求，有的人又主动增加了看锭的数量。元丰毛纺织厂织机部工人，原来一人看一台织机，现在一人可以看两台，合并生产以后，房子有了剩余，不但车间劳动条件得到了改善，宿舍有了增加，许多厂还准备设立工人游艺室或工人俱乐部，职工福利也得到了改善。
    合并合营后，资本家在公方代表的领导和职工群众的监督下，生产积极性也有提高。如裕民毛纺厂有的资本家过去不常到厂，现在天天到厂，并且建议按时上下班。精益毛纺厂资本家徐钦瑜并到元丰毛纺织厂后，还参加了布置生产计划会议，表示要改造自己。
    五十三个私营厂，虽已合并合营，但这些厂的经营管理亟待改进，企业的资本家及代理人，还须要进行改造。为了加强领导，全面规划，保证完成国家计划，贯彻双重改造，已在合并合营基础上，成立了国营上海毛麻纺织公司来领导这些工厂，这对于今后统一布置生产任务，统一调配劳动力，组织技术力量，提高品质，降低成本，逐步提高企业管理水平，准备了有利条件。
