Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 29th: The Japan Peace Committee held a meeting in Tokyo on November 28th to discuss the Japanese government's unreasonable arrest of five overseas Chinese who wished to return to China.

　　The meeting decided to urge the Japanese government to promptly allow Chinese nationals wishing to return home to board ships and return to China. Based on investigation results, the meeting concluded that the Japanese government authorities' "prosecution" of Pan Guangkun and three others was without factual basis. Therefore, it was decided to oppose the government authorities' "prosecution." The meeting also decided to promptly publish the investigation results of the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, and the Japan-China Friendship Association regarding the "Hamamatsu Incident."

　　The meeting also decided to work to promote the free exchange of nationals between China and Japan.
