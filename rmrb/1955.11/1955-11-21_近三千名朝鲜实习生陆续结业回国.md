Nearly Three Thousand Korean Interns Graduate and Return Home

In accordance with the Sino-Korean government's technical assistance agreement of November 1953, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea sent 2,962 interns to China in 1954. They interned in 224 factories and mines in 39 cities across China. After a year of intensive study, these interns began to graduate and return to their country in the fourth quarter of this year. According to graduation tests, the vast majority achieved excellent results.

To better assist the Korean interns in learning technology, most of the Chinese factories and mines accepting interns established intern guidance committees, equipped with politically and professionally strong theoretical instructors and master workers, and formulated practical internship plans based on the interns' professional level and the plant's equipment. Party and government leaders in many factories and mines were very concerned about and regularly checked the interns' learning and living conditions. For example, the director of the Anshan Iron and Steel Welding Pipe Factory often convened forums with interns or master workers to listen to their opinions.

Workers in factories and mines with Korean interns, especially the theoretical instructors and master workers responsible for teaching, were able to promote the spirit of internationalism and conscientiously find ways to impart technology to the interns. The interns also greatly respected and loved the instructors and master workers. The Korean interns at the Tianjin Steel Plant said: "The master workers in the workshop treat us like their own children." When the interns at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant graduated and returned home, many shed tears, reluctantly saying, "I really don't want to leave our second hometown."

The Korean interns had a high enthusiasm for learning. The interns at the North China Metal Structure Factory automatically established a study system and competed with interns from other factories. The interns at the Shenyang Sujiatun Nonferrous Metals Processing Plant actively studied and researched, and most of them reached the standards of sixth or seventh-grade workers. Li Jishou, an intern at the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, improved the sand application method and operating procedures, saving materials and increasing work efficiency threefold, and was praised. Many interns were reluctant to rest even during their spare time, and some insisted on studying even when they were ill. Before work every day, some interns would automatically wipe down lathes, tools, and the factory's glass, creating good conditions for internship operations. (Peng Jinbo)

　　近三千名朝鲜实习生陆续结业回国
    按照一九五三年十一月中朝政府技术援助协定，一九五四年朝鲜民主主义人民共和国到我国的实习生有二千九百六十二名，他们分别在我国三十九个城市的二百二十四个厂矿里实习。这批实习生经过一年来的紧张学习，在本年第四季度开始陆续结业回国。根据结业测验，绝大部分人成绩优良。
    为了更好地帮助朝鲜实习生学习技术，我国接受实习生的厂矿大多数都成立了实习生指导委员会，配备了政治、业务较好的理论教员和老师傅，并根据实习生的业务水平和本厂的设备，制定了切实可行的实习计划。许多厂矿的党政领导工作人员都非常关心和经常检查实习生的学习情况和生活情况。如鞍钢焊接钢管厂厂长经常召集实习生或老师傅开座谈会，听取他们的意见。
    有朝鲜实习生的各厂矿工人，尤其是担任教学的理论教员、老师傅都能发扬国际主义精神，认真想办法把技术传授给实习生。实习生对教员和老师傅也都非常尊敬和热爱，天津钢厂的朝鲜实习生们说：车间的老师傅对我们就像对亲儿女一样。太原钢铁厂实习生结业回国时，很多人流着泪，恋恋不舍地说：“我真不愿离开我们的第二故乡。”
    朝鲜实习生的学习热情很高。华北金属结构工厂的实习生自动订出了学习制度，同其他各厂的实习生竞赛。沈阳苏家屯有色金属加工厂的实习生积极钻研，大部分人都达到六级或七级工的标准。太原矿山机器厂的实习生李基守改进了用砂方法及操作规程，节约了材料，提高了工作效率三倍，受到了表扬。很多实习生都在休息时间也不肯休息，有的患病还要坚持学习。有的实习生在每天开工前，就自动擦拭车床、工具和厂房的玻璃等，给实习操作创造良好的条件。　（彭金波）
