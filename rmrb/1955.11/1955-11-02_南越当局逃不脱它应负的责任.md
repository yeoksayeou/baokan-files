The South Vietnamese Authorities Cannot Escape Their Due Responsibility

After Ngo Dinh Diem held the so-called "referendum," he openly declared the establishment of the so-called "Republic of Vietnam" in South Vietnam and crowned himself "President." Subsequently, Ngo Dinh Diem's "new government" announced that its "primary task" was to formulate a "constitution" and hold separate "elections," but made no mention of fulfilling the tasks of the Geneva Accords.

These facts further prove that the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is attempting to use a series of fraudulent public opinion schemes to continue resisting the implementation of the Geneva Accords, creating a long-term division of Vietnam, forming a separate state in South Vietnam, and subsequently joining the Southeast Asia Military Group, turning it into a military base serving American war policies. The Associated Press stated without concealment that Ngo Dinh Diem's "referendum" "seems to rule out any possibility of holding unified elections in North and South Vietnam next July."

It must be pointed out that Article 14 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam authorizes the party that assembles troops south of the temporary military demarcation line to be responsible for local civil administration, on the premise of "holding national elections to achieve the unification of Vietnam." Paragraph 6 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also emphatically "recognizes that the military demarcation line is provisional and should not in any way be interpreted as constituting a political or territorial boundary." Therefore, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique's attempt to turn South Vietnam into a separate country is completely untenable in law. The so-called "constitution" and separate "elections" that it will continue to create are also illegal.

According to the Geneva Accords, no matter how many tricks the Ngo Dinh Diem clique plays in South Vietnam, it cannot escape its responsibility as the South Vietnamese authorities. Article 27 of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam clearly stipulates: "The signatories to this document and their successors in office shall be responsible for ensuring the observance and implementation of the terms and provisions thereof." Whether the Ngo Dinh Diem government is part of a signatory to the agreement or a successor to a signatory, as long as it remains the responsible authority in South Vietnam, it is obliged to abide by and implement the Geneva Accords. At present, the primary task is to consult with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to arrange free general elections throughout Vietnam.

The various activities of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in violation of the Geneva Accords are clearly supported and encouraged by the U.S. government. Agence France-Presse pointed out on October 24, when discussing the issue of general elections throughout Vietnam: "The United States seems to want to delay, or even evade, such general elections. Since Ngo Dinh Diem, who is supported by the United States, is likely to prevail, South Vietnam will inevitably reflect the views of the United States on the election issue in the future." The U.S. government's continued public expression of "support" for Ngo Dinh Diem and its recent haste to recognize Ngo Dinh Diem as the so-called "head of state" all the more clearly confirm this. These actions by the United States violate the solemn obligations it assumed at the Geneva Conference, the national will of all the Vietnamese people, and the wishes of all people around the world who demand faithful implementation of the Geneva Accords to help ease the international situation in the Far East.

As a signatory to the Geneva Accords, France, although declaring that it will continue to fulfill the Geneva Accords, has neither taken effective measures to promote the convening of consultative conferences to discuss the issue of general elections throughout Vietnam, nor has it been responsible for preventing the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique from engaging in activities that violate the Geneva Accords within the French Union troop assembly areas. This attitude of the French government is completely inconsistent with its promise to fulfill the Geneva Accords, and it is clearly not conducive to consolidating peace in Indochina.

The Vietnamese people have expressed great indignation at the actions of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique in undermining the Geneva Accords. In a resolution adopted on October 29, the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front stated its firm opposition to the conspiracy of the United States and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to formulate a "constitution," establish a separate "national assembly," and drag South Vietnam into the Southeast Asia group, demanding that the Southern authorities consult with the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and correctly discuss the issue of free general elections to unify the country in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and demanding that the French government, which signed the Geneva Accords, thoroughly implement the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people express their full sympathy and firm support for this just demand. The Geneva Accords must be implemented, and the conspiracy to divide Vietnam must be stopped.

### 南越当局逃不脱它应负的责任

    南越当局逃不脱它应负的责任
    吴庭艳举行了所谓“公民投票”之后，公然宣布在越南南方成立所谓“越南共和国”，并自封为“总统”。接着吴庭艳的“新政府”又宣布它的“首要任务”是制定“宪法”和举行单独的“选举”，但对于履行日内瓦协议的任务却只字不提。
    这些事实进一步证明了吴庭艳集团企图假借一系列的假造民意的阴谋活动，以继续抗拒履行日内瓦协议，造成越南的长期分裂，使越南南方形成一个单独的国家，进而加入东南亚军事集团，把它变成为美国战争政策服务的军事基地。美联社毫不掩饰地说，吴庭艳的
  “公民投票”，“似乎排斥了任何在明年七月在北越和南越举行统一选举的可能性”。
    必须指出，日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第十四条授权在临时军事分界线以南集结部队的一方负责当地的民政，是以“举行获致越南统一的全国选举”的规定为前提的。日内瓦会议最后宣言第六条又强调地“确认军事分界线是临时性的界线，无论如何不能被解释为政治的或领土的边界”。因此，吴庭艳集团企图把越南南方变为一个单独的国家，在法律上是完全站不住脚的。它将继续制造出来的所谓“宪法”和单独“选举”，也都是非法的。
    根据日内瓦协议，不管吴庭艳集团在越南南方玩多少花样，都逃避不了它作为越南南方当局所应负的责任。日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动的协定第二十七条明确地规定：“本文件签署人及其职务的继任人均应负责遵守并实施本协定的各项条款和规定。”吴庭艳政府无论是作为签署协定的一方的一部分或作为签署协定一方的继任人，只要它仍是越南南方的负责当局，它就有义务遵守和履行日内瓦协议，在目前，首要的任务就是和越南民主共和国政府进行协商，安排全越自由普选。
    吴庭艳集团违背日内瓦协议的各种活动，显然是受到美国政府的支持和鼓励的。法新社在十月二十四日谈到全越普选问题时就指出：“美国似乎想拖延、甚至逃避这种普选。既然受美国支持的吴庭艳很可能占上风，今后南越必然会在选举问题上极力反映美国的意见。”美国政府不断公开表示“支持”吴庭艳和最近赶忙承认吴庭艳是所谓“国家元首”种种行动，就更加清楚地证实了这一点。美国这些行为，违背了它在日内瓦会议上所承担的庄严义务，违背了全体越南人民的民族意志，违背了全世界一切要求忠实地履行日内瓦协议以有助于缓和远东国际局势的人们的愿望。
    作为日内瓦协议签字一方的法国，虽然宣布它将要继续履行日内瓦协议，可是它既没有采取有效的措施来促成讨论全越普选问题的协商会议的召开，又没有负责制止美国和吴庭艳集团在法兰西联邦部队集结区内进行违反日内瓦协议的行为。法国政府的这种态度，完全不符合于它履行日内瓦协议的诺言，这显然无助于巩固印度支那的和平。
    越南人民对于美国和吴庭艳集团破坏日内瓦协议的行为表示了极大的愤慨。越南祖国战线中央委员会常务委员会扩大会议在十月二十九日通过的决议中表示，坚决反对美国和吴庭艳集团在越南南方制定“宪法”、成立单独的“国会”和把越南南方拖入东南亚集团的阴谋，要求南方当局和越南民主共和国政府进行协商，正确按照日内瓦协议来讨论自由普选统一国家的问题，并要求签订日内瓦协议的法国政府彻底地执行日内瓦协议。中国人民对于这一正义的要求表示完全的同情和坚决的支持。日内瓦协议必须执行，分裂越南的阴谋活动必须制止。
