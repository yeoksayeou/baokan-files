Xinhua News Agency, November 6th dispatch from Moscow, TASS reported on the 5th: The Executive Committee of the Women's International Democratic Federation held a meeting in Moscow from November 2nd to 4th. The meeting heard and discussed the report by Mrs. Gordon, Chairman of the Women's International Democratic Federation, on the activities of the Women's International Democratic Federation over the past ten years and the future prospects for the development of the democratic women's movement.

Mrs. Gordon pointed out that in the ten years since the founding of the Women's International Democratic Federation, the scale of the international women's movement has been expanding and its strength has been growing. When it was founded, it united 80 million women in 40 countries; today it represents more than 200 million women and its influence extends to 80 countries. All of this places a huge responsibility on the Federation and its national member organizations, and poses new tasks for them: to attract more women to participate in the struggle to safeguard peace, defend children, strive for the relaxation of international tensions, and fight for women's rights.

The meeting adopted the Appeal to Women of the World on the Tenth Anniversary of the Women's International Democratic Federation, a letter to the Geneva Four-Power Foreign Ministers' Conference, and a resolution defining the future prospects for the Federation's work.

The resolution recommends that women's organizations in various countries launch mass activities for the Federation's tenth anniversary, widely publicizing its aims and tasks and the achievements of the democratic women's movement over the past ten years. The resolution also expressed support for the World Federation of Trade Unions' initiative to hold an international conference of women workers in 1956, and called on women's organizations in various countries to actively participate in preparing for this conference. The resolution decided to hold a meeting of the Council of the Women's International Democratic Federation in early 1956.

In its Appeal to Women of the World, the Executive Committee called on women of all countries to further expand and strengthen unity to defend peace, safeguard women's rights and the happiness of children. The Appeal to Women of the World called on women of all countries to abandon everything that causes division, consolidate the friendship of women around the world, unite as one, and fight together for disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the settlement of all issues threatening peace through peaceful negotiations.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Budapest, TASS reported: On November 10, 1955, the World Federation of Democratic Youth will celebrate its tenth anniversary. To celebrate this day, the Secretariat of the World Federation of Democratic Youth issued an appeal to the youth of the world.

The appeal to the youth stated: This world alliance, born in the struggle against war and fascism and growing strong with the support of young people, now unites 300 youth organizations in 97 countries, with 85 million members. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has become an unprecedentedly large world youth organization.

The appeal to the youth pointed out that the ten years since the founding of the World Federation of Democratic Youth have been ten years of resolute struggle to safeguard peace, oppose the threat of new wars, strive for the happiness of youth in the future, and strive for the unity and friendship of the younger generation.

In these ten years, five grand festivals and hundreds of unprecedented cultural and sports activities have been held.

The appeal to the youth stated that we wholeheartedly welcome the easing of international tensions, especially the easing of international tensions after the Geneva Conference of Heads of Government of the Four Great Powers, which opened up great prospects for the cause of peace.

Young men and women of all countries! We call on you to promote the consolidation of peace and the easing of international tensions by organizing mutual visits of delegations, holding lectures, holding cultural and sports festivals, and taking many other measures.

We call on you to intensify the struggle for the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, for the peaceful use of atomic energy, for disarmament, for the collective security of all nations, and for negotiations on all international issues. It is necessary to strive to make the "Geneva spirit" triumph in all countries.

On November 10 – International Youth Day – we reaffirm our vow: all the strength and all the passion of our youth will be dedicated to the cause of promoting international youth solidarity, to the cause of improving the living conditions of youth, and to the cause of strengthening friendship and unity.

    戈登夫人指出，国际民主妇女联合会成立十年来，国际妇女运动的规模日益扩大，力量日益雄厚。它成立的时候团结有四十个国家的八千多万妇女，今天它代表二亿多妇女，它的影响扩展到八十个国家。所有这一切使联合会和它的各国会员组织担负一个巨大的责任，向它们提出了新的任务：吸引更多的妇女参加维护和平、保卫儿童、争取缓和国际局势、争取妇女权利的斗争。
    会议通过了国际民主妇女联合会成立十周年告全世界妇女书、致日内瓦四国外交部长会议的信和确定联合会今后工作前景的决议。
    决议建议各国妇女组织为联合会十周年展开群众性的活动，广泛宣传它的宗旨和任务以及过去十年来民主妇女运动的成就。决议还表示支持世界工会联合会倡议在一九五六年举行的国际女工会议，并且号召各国妇女组织积极参加筹备这个会议。决议决定在一九五六年初举行国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议。
    执行委员会在告全世界妇女书中号召各国妇女们更加扩大和加强团结，以保卫和平、保障妇女的权利和儿童的幸福。告全世界妇女书号召各国妇女抛弃一切造成分裂的东西，巩固全世界妇女的友谊，团结一致，为争取裁减军备、禁止原子武器、用和平谈判的方式来解决威胁和平的一切问题而共同斗争。
    新华社讯据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：一九五五年十一月十日，世界民主青年联盟将庆祝它成立十周年纪念。为了庆祝这个日子，世界民主青年联盟书记处发表了一个告全世界青年书。
    告青年书说：在反对战争和法西斯主义的斗争中诞生的、在青年们的支持下壮大起来的这个世界联盟现在联合着九十七个国家的三百个青年组织，拥有会员八千五百万人。世界民主青年联盟已经成为空前壮大的世界青年组织。
    告青年书指出，世界民主青年联盟成立以来的十年，是为维护和平、反对新战争威胁、争取青年幸福的未来、争取青年一代的团结和友谊而坚决斗争的十年。
    在这十年中，曾举行了五次盛大的联欢节以及几百次规模空前的文化和体育活动。
    告青年书说，我们衷心欢迎国际紧张局势的缓和，特别是为和平事业开辟了伟大前途的四大国政府首脑日内瓦会议之后的国际紧张局势的缓和。
    各国男女青年们！我们号召你们通过组织代表团的相互访问，举办讲座，举行文化和体育的联欢节以及采取其他许多措施，来促进巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势。
    我们号召你们为争取禁止大规模毁灭性武器，争取和平利用原子能，争取裁减军备，争取各国人民的集体安全，争取就一切国际问题举行谈判而加紧进行斗争。必须争取使“日内瓦精神”在各国取得胜利。
    在十一月十日——国际青年节，我们重申我们的誓言：我们青年的全部力量和我们青年的满腔热情，都要献给增进国际青年团结的事业，献给改善青年生活条件的事业，献给加强友谊和团结的事业。
