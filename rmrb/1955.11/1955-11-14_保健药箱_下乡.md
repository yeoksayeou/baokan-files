　　"Healthcare Medicine Chests" Go to the Countryside
    The Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Jilin, and five other provincial companies affiliated with the China National Pharmaceutical Corporation have recently rushed to produce a batch of "Healthcare Medicine Chests" to meet the needs of agricultural producers' cooperatives in establishing medical prevention and first-aid sanitary facilities after training health workers. The "Healthcare Medicine Chest" is a clean and easy-to-carry box, containing dozens of commonly used medicines for farmers, some simple surgical instruments, medicines, and dressings, and is accompanied by a detailed instruction manual on how to use these medicines and instruments. Because agricultural producers' cooperatives vary in size, economic conditions, and the technical level of health workers, the "Healthcare Medicine Chests" are manufactured in three different sizes: large, medium, and small.
　　After the "Healthcare Medicine Chests" went to the countryside, they were very popular among the members of the cooperatives. Wang Yulan, a member of the Heping Agricultural Production Cooperative in Kongjia Village, Seventh District, Qufu County, Shandong Province, suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain while working in the fields. After taking "Emergency Relief Water" from the "Healthcare Medicine Chest," she immediately felt better. Many farmers have recovered quickly after taking medicine when they were sick. They all said: It's good to walk the socialist road; with medicine in the cooperative, our health is guaranteed.
    The upsurge of agricultural cooperation has arrived on a national scale. Local health departments are actively strengthening rural health care institutions, training health workers and midwives for agricultural producers' cooperatives, and pharmaceutical companies are actively supplying "Healthcare Medicine Chests," which will play an important role in the health of farmers and increased agricultural production.

　  “保健药箱”下乡
    中国医药公司所属浙江、江苏、云南、吉林等八个省公司，最近赶制一批“保健药箱”，供应农业生产合作社训练保健员后建立医药预防和急救等卫生设备的需要。“保健药箱”是一个整洁而又便于携带的箱子，里面装着几十种农民常用的成药，一些简单的外科器具、药品和敷料，附有使用这些药品、器具的详细说明——保健手册。因为农业生产社有大小，经济条件和保健员技术水平也都有不同，制造的“保健药箱”也有大、中、小三种不同的规格。
      “保健药箱”下乡后，很受广大社员的欢迎。山东曲阜县七区孔家村和平生产合作社社员王玉兰在地里干活，忽然肚子剧痛，后来服了“保健药箱”里的“救急水”，马上就好了。许多农民有病服药后都很快治好。他们都说：走社会主义道路就是好，社里有了药，身体健康有了保证。
    农业合作化的高潮在全国范围内已经到来。各地卫生部门正在积极加强农村卫生保健机构，为农业生产合作社训练保健员、接生员，医药公司又积极供应“保健药箱”，这对农民身体健康和农业增产，将起重要的作用。
