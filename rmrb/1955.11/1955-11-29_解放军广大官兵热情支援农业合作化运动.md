　　The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in various places are supporting the national agricultural cooperation movement with practical actions.

　　The officers and soldiers of various organs and units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing have conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's report on the issue of agricultural cooperation and the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Officers and soldiers have written letters to mobilize their families and relatives to join agricultural production cooperatives. The officers and soldiers of a certain guard company have recently written a total of more than 370 letters to their families. Zhang Xiqing, the deputy squad leader of a certain company, bought seven copies of the newspaper containing Chairman Mao's report on agricultural cooperation and sent them to his family and relatives. Wu Baoju, a soldier from a certain regiment, persuaded his father, who came to visit him in the army, to return home and join the agricultural production cooperative. Many organs and units are organizing officers and soldiers to visit agricultural production cooperatives to deepen their understanding of the cooperative movement.

　　Many officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Xi'an have also sent part of their savings to their families as capital for purchasing means of production. Zheng Shijia, a health worker from a certain unit, recently returned to his mother's home in Laijia Village, Tongliang County, Sichuan Province. While visiting relatives and neighbors in the village, he went to the homes of poor peasants who had not yet joined the cooperative to promote the benefits of agricultural cooperation. He also investigated the production and distribution of the old cooperative in the village, using examples to introduce it to the uncooperativized farmers and helping individual farmers calculate the details. With Zheng Shijia's help, Zheng Peixiang and Deng Chusheng in Laijia Village have applied to join the cooperative. He Chongmin, a soldier from a certain unit, not only persuaded his entire family to join the cooperative within twenty days of returning to his hometown, but also traveled throughout the township to promote the benefits of cooperation to the farmers.

　　Lin Guangren, a soldier from the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, wrote to mobilize his father to join the cooperative. His father replied, "The road pointed out by Chairman Mao is good, and I have already figured it out. I will definitely join the agricultural production cooperative." Lin Tinghao, a new recruit who served as the director of an agricultural production cooperative before enlisting, wrote to his hometown's agricultural production cooperative asking them to run the cooperative even better.

　　Many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have also transferred cadres to rural areas to assist local Party and government organs in carrying out the cooperation movement. The direct organs of the Hetao Military Sub-district sent a group of cadres to the countryside in late October to participate in the agricultural cooperation movement. The leading organs of the Xinjiang Military Region Agricultural Production and Construction Corps have also recently instructed their subordinate units to transfer a considerable number of cadres and technicians to be specifically responsible for assisting farmers near their garrisons in setting up cooperatives and improving farming techniques.

　　解放军广大官兵热情支援农业合作化运动
    中国人民解放军驻各地部队的军官和士兵以实际行动拥护和支援全国农业合作化运动。
    中国人民解放军驻北京各机关、部队的官兵对毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告和中共中央七届六中全会（扩大）的决议等文件进行了认真的学习。军官和士兵纷纷写信动员家属和亲友参加农业生产合作社。某警卫连的官兵近来一共写了三百七十多封家信。某连副班长张锡庆一人就买了七份刊登着毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告的报纸，寄给家属和亲友。某团士兵吴宝巨说服到部队来探亲的父亲回家后参加农业生产合作社。许多机关和部队正在组织军官和士兵参观、访问农业生产合作社，以加深对合作化运动的了解。
    驻南京、广州和西安等地区的部队的许多军官和士兵还把自己积蓄的一部分钱寄给家属做为购置生产资料的资本。某部卫生员郑世嘉最近回到四川省铜梁县来家村探望母亲，他在村中借着探亲友、看乡邻的机会到还没有入社的贫农家中串门，宣传农业合作化的好处；他并且调查了村中老社生产和分配的情况，用实例向未入社的农民介绍，帮助单干农民算细账。在郑世嘉的帮助下，来家村中郑培香和邓楚生等都已经申请入社。某部士兵贺重民回到家乡的二十天内，不仅劝说了自己全家入社，并且跑遍全乡向农民宣传合作化的好处。
      福建前线的人民解放军某部第五连士兵林广仁写信动员父亲入社，他父亲回信说：“毛主席指点的道路好，我已经想通了。我一定参加农业生产合作社。”应征入伍的新兵林廷豪入伍前担任过农业生产合作社社长，他写信要求本乡的农业生产合作社要把社办得更好。
    中国人民解放军的许多部队还抽调干部下乡协助地方党和政府机关开展合作化运动。河套军分区直属机关在十月下旬派出了一批干部到农村去，参加农业合作化运动。新疆军区农业生产建设部队的领导机关最近也指示所属各部队抽调相当数量的干部和技术人员，专门负责协助驻地附近农民办社和改进耕作技术。（新华社）
