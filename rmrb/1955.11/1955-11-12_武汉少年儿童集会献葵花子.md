　　Wuhan Children's Gathering to Offer Sunflower Seeds
　　More than 1,000 Young Pioneers in Wuhan City held a team meeting on the afternoon of the 5th with the theme "Presenting Sunflower Seeds to the Motherland," at which they presented a total of 2,000 catties of sunflower seeds to the Motherland. Wei Tinghuai, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan City, and responsible cadres from the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League and other organizations attended the gathering.
　　At the meeting, representatives of the Young Pioneers teams from some schools reported on their sunflower planting activities. When the Young Pioneers of the Lanjiangdi Primary School in Wuhan City planted sunflowers, they actively consulted experienced veteran farmers and learned techniques such as sowing, transplanting, and fertilizing. During days of strong winds and rain, all team members worked together to dig ditches for drainage and build embankments to prevent damage to the sunflowers. The sunflowers they planted grew plump and strong. Many children were admitted into the Young Pioneers in the sunflower planting activities because they could actively labor and help others.
　　Wei Tinghuai, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan City, congratulated the Young Pioneers at the meeting for achieving greater success in future sunflower planting activities. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League presented the children with a brocade banner and commended some outstanding team members and squadrons.
　　After the meeting, the Young Pioneers performed self-created musical and dance programs such as the "Sunflower Dance" and "Digging Earthworms." (Xinhua News Agency)

　　武汉少年儿童集会献葵花子
    武汉市一千多名少年先锋队员在五日下午举行“把葵花子献给祖国”的队会，他们在会上献给祖国的葵花子共有两千斤。武汉市副市长魏廷槐和青年团武汉市委员会等机关负责干部都参加了这一集会。
    会上，一些学校的少年先锋队代表汇报了他们种植向日葵活动的情况。武汉市栏江堤小学的少年先锋队员种植向日葵的时候，主动地向有经验的老农民请教，学会了播种、移苗和施肥等技术。在大风雨的日子里，全体队员一起挖沟排水、修筑堤防，使向日葵没有受到损害。他们种植的向日葵长得又肥又壮。许多少年儿童在种植向日葵的活动中，因为能积极劳动和帮助别人，先后被吸收加入了少年先锋队。
    武汉市副市长魏廷槐在会上祝贺少年先锋队员在今后种植向日葵的活动中取得更大的成绩。青年团武汉市委员会赠给孩子们一面锦旗，并且表扬了一些优秀队员和中队。
    会后，少年先锋队员们表演了自己创作的“向日葵舞”和“掘地蚕”等音乐舞蹈节目。（新华社）
