　　Oppose the South African Federal Government's Policy of Racial Discrimination
　　Liang Tian
    The Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its discussion on the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa on November 9th. Ignoring the opposition of colonial countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, the meeting overwhelmingly passed a proposal jointly put forward by seventeen countries from Asia, Africa, and Latin America, condemning the South African Federal Government for continuing to implement its policy of racial segregation despite the recommendations of the United Nations General Assembly. The decision of the UN General Assembly's Special Political Committee is in line with the wishes of impartial people in all countries. After the Special Political Committee of the UN General Assembly made its decision, the South African Federal Government announced the recall of its delegation attending this session of the General Assembly. This action by the South African Federal Government only demonstrates the serious failure of colonial countries that uphold the principle of racial discrimination, and it cannot allow it to escape the condemnation of world public opinion.
    Since the establishment of the United Nations, the South African Federal Government's discrimination against residents of Indian descent and Africans within its borders has been repeatedly included on the agenda of the General Assembly. Regardless of the obstruction of a few colonial countries and the resistance of South African Federal representatives, all sessions of the United Nations General Assembly from 1946 to 1951 (except the Fourth Session) adopted resolutions, believing that the treatment of Indians in South Africa should comply with the agreements between South Africa and India and the provisions of the United Nations Charter, and hoping that the two countries would negotiate on their own. In 1952, the Seventh General Assembly decided to establish the United Nations South African Racial Situation Investigation Committee to study the international impact of racial conflict in South Africa. In 1953, the Eighth General Assembly once again condemned South Africa for refusing to cooperate with the Conciliation Committee, for continuing to implement the "Racial Segregation Law" despite the General Assembly's resolution, and for its actions that did not comply with the United Nations Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights, and decided that the Conciliation Committee should continue its work. The Ninth General Assembly once again adopted a resolution recommending that India and Pakistan negotiate directly with the South African Federation. The resolution also pointed out that if the two sides still failed to reach an agreement on the treatment of Indian residents in South Africa within a certain period, the Secretary-General of the United Nations should appoint a person to achieve the above-mentioned purpose, and the Secretary-General should report on the progress of the work to the Tenth General Assembly. However, the South African Federal Government has always disregarded the resolutions of the General Assembly and adopted an attitude of refusing to cooperate. At this session of the General Assembly, the South African Federation still adopted its consistent position, resisting the General Assembly's discussion of the issue of racial discrimination in South Africa. This behavior of the South African government can only make its crimes more conspicuous.
    As everyone knows, the South African Federal Government implements many reactionary racial discrimination decrees and fascist measures that undermine basic human rights in order to maintain the rule of a minority of white people in South Africa and place non-Europeans, who account for four-fifths of the South African population, in an oppressed and unequal position. For example, the "Racial Segregation Law" promulgated and implemented in March 1951 is one of the most barbaric and brutal racial discrimination measures. It stipulates that South Africa should be divided into three regions within ten years: European resident areas, Indian and mixed-race areas, and African areas; tens of thousands of non-Europeans are forced to move out of the vast and fertile land allocated to "European resident areas" and are restricted to living in small and barren "specific residential areas". For example, in Transvaal Province, Africans, who account for 70 percent of the population, are forced to live in "specific residential areas" that account for only 3.7 percent of the province's total land area, and cannot obtain the products necessary to maintain a minimum standard of living. This law allows a small number of white farmers and mine owners to possess more land.
    The so-called "Pass Law" implemented by the South African Federal Government is even more barbaric. It stipulates that colored people must carry twelve kinds of certificates with them, such as "residence permits," "accommodation permits," and "night travel permits"...etc. If they are found to be missing any documents, they will be imprisoned. Prison authorities "rent out" these "prisoners" in large numbers to mine owners or farmers for forced labor. According to the annual report of the South African Federal Prison Superintendent, in 1954, the South African government's income from "renting out" imprisoned laborers reached 126,291 pounds.
    The South African Federal Government also implements many other reactionary legislations. For example, according to the "Electoral Representative Law," the vast non-European people are deprived of their right to vote. Among the 159 members of the South African Federal Parliament, non-European representatives account for only three, and these three must be non-Europeans who have acquired British nationality. Another example is the "Slavery Law," which stipulates that the "Labor Bureau" specially set up by the South African government and the so-called "Native Inspectors" all over the country have the right to arbitrarily interrogate and sentence African laborers, and send them to farms or mines to do hard labor. Another example is the "Suppression of Communism Law," which stipulates that the South African government has unlimited power to restrict citizens' freedom of thought, speech, and association. Any party, group, gathering, publication, or individual that resists the fascist rule of the South African government can be declared illegal or illegal. Other laws such as the "Population Registration Law," the "Land Ownership Law," the "Public Security Law," and the "Implementation Law on Pure Blood Certificates" are also aimed at depriving non-Europeans of their political, economic, and social rights.
    The insults suffered by colored people in South African social life are an even greater contempt for human dignity. An African worker cannot appear in public places or enter all cities in South Africa without a permit signed by his master. Even for non-Europeans taking buses, walking, buying tickets, and making phone calls, there are certain places where they must be separated from white people.
    Not only that, but the South African Federal Government has recently formulated new laws, preparing to increase and intensify racial discrimination, and has adjusted the legislative and judicial bodies to step up the suppression of the South African people's resistance to racial segregation and discrimination.
    The South African Federal Government's policies of racial discrimination and national oppression are policies that serve the huge profits of a small number of European mine owners and farmers, and are policies that create division and antagonism between white and colored people, as well as between colored people and colored people, and between tribes and tribes. These policies are based on the demands of mine owners and farmers, who need cheap and docile labor. The role of the South African Federal Government's various barbaric racial "legislations" is to provide them with colored slave labor and ensure that workers are not allowed to organize to fight for political and living rights.
    However, the vast majority of South Africans have not succumbed to the South African Federal Government's high-pressure tactics. People of all ethnic groups in South Africa are fighting more and more resolutely against racial discrimination, and have continuously strengthened their unity in the struggle. In June 1950, the South African Communist Party, the African National Congress, and the South African Indian Congress launched a nationwide political strike to oppose the South African government's promulgation of laws persecuting communists. In this strike struggle, many white workers also stood on the same front as hundreds of thousands of non-European workers. In June 1952, the largest colored people's political movement in South African history—the "Movement Against Unjust Laws" was victoriously launched. Although more than 100 social and trade union leaders were banned from participating in public activities, and more than 8,000 people were imprisoned, the struggle against racial discrimination has significantly improved the political consciousness of the masses, and mass protests, rallies, and demonstrations, as well as strike struggles, have been widely launched throughout the country. In particular, the South African People's Congress for Democracy and Freedom held in Johannesburg in June this year, with more than 3,000 representatives from all over South Africa participating in the conference, unanimously adopted the "Freedom Charter" of the South African people. They vowed to "struggle together, sparing no effort or courage, until" the "democratic reforms stipulated" in the Charter "are victoriously realized." This shows the strong will of the South African people to fight for democratic rights.
    The struggle of people of all ethnic groups in South Africa against racial discrimination and for human rights is a just cause, and it has won the sympathy and support of the Chinese people and the people of all countries. The resolution passed at the Asian-African Conference in April this year condemned the policies of racial segregation and discrimination implemented by the South African Federal Government, and pointed out that "this behavior is not only a gross violation of human rights, but also a denial of the basic values of civilization and human dignity." This represents the protest and condemnation of hundreds of millions of people in the two major continents of Asia and Africa against the South African Federal Government. The wave of opposition to racial discrimination around the world is continuing to grow, and the South African people's struggle for human rights and freedom is developing. The South African Federal reactionary ruling clique will surely incur evil consequences for continuing these reactionary and inhumane measures, and justice will eventually be served.

　　反对南非联邦政府种族歧视政策
　　梁田
    联合国大会特别政治委员会于十一月九日结束了关于南非种族歧视问题的讨论，会议不顾美英等殖民国家的反对，以绝大多数通过了由亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的十七个国家联合提出的提案，谴责南非联邦政府不顾联合国大会的建议，继续执行种族隔离政策。联大特别政委会的决定，是符合各国公正人士的愿望的。南非联邦政府于联大特别政委会作出决议后宣布召回它出席本届联大的代表团。南非联邦政府的这种做法只是表明维护种族歧视原则的殖民国家的严重失败，而并不能使它逃脱世界公众舆论的谴责。
    自从联合国成立以来，南非联邦政府歧视境内印度血统居民和非洲人的问题曾多次列入联大议程。不顾少数殖民国家的阻挠和南非联邦代表的抵制，一九四六至一九五一年的历届联合国大会（第四届除外）都曾作出决议，认为印度人在南非的待遇应符合南非和印度两国之间的协定和联合国宪章的规定，并希望两国自行谈判。一九五二年第七届联大又决定成立联合国南非种族情况调查委员会，研究南非种族冲突所产生的国际影响。一九五三年第八届联大再一次谴责南非拒绝同斡旋委员会合作，不顾大会决议继续实施“种族隔离法”及其不符合联合国宪章和人权宣言的行动，并决定斡旋委员会继续工作。第九届联大又一次作出决议，建议印度、巴基斯坦同南非联邦直接谈判，决议并指出，如果在一定时期内双方就南非境内印度居民待遇问题仍未达成协议时，联合国秘书长应指定专人来达成上述目的，秘书长应向第十届联大报告工作进展情况。但是南非联邦政府一直蔑视联大的决议，采取拒绝合作的态度。在本届联大中，南非联邦仍然采取一贯的立场，抵制大会讨论南非的种族歧视问题。南非政府的这种行径，只能使它的罪恶欲盖弥彰。
    大家知道，南非联邦政府实行着许多反动的种族歧视法令和摧残基本人权的法西斯措施，以保持少数白种人在南非的统治并把占南非人口五分之四的非欧洲人置于受压迫的不平等地位。例如，一九五一年三月公布实行的“种族隔离法”，就是一项最野蛮残暴的种族歧视措施。它规定要在十年内把南非划分为三个地区：欧洲居民区、印度人和混血种人区以及非洲人区；成千成万的非欧洲人被迫从分配给“欧洲居民区”的广大而肥沃的土地上迁移出去，而限居在土地狭小而贫瘠的“特定住区”内。例如在德兰士瓦省，占人口百分之七十的非洲人，被迫挤住在只占全省土地面积百分之三点七的“特定住区”内，无法获得维持最低生活水平所必需的生产品。这种法律使少数白种人的农场主和矿场主得以占有更多的土地。
    南非联邦政府实行的所谓“通行证法”，更是野蛮透顶。它规定有色人必须随身携带“居留证”、“住宿证”、“夜行证”……等十二种证件，如果一旦被发现证件不全时，就要遭受囚禁。监狱当局把这些“囚徒”大批“出租”给矿场主或农场主从事强迫劳动。据南非联邦监狱总监年报的统计，一九五四年南非政府因“出租”囚禁的劳动者而得到的收入就达十二万六千二百九十一镑。
    南非联邦政府还实行着其他许多反动立法。如根据“选举人代表法”，广大的非欧洲籍人民被剥夺了选举权利。在南非联邦议会一百五十九名议员中，非欧洲籍代表只占三名，而这三名还必须是取得英国国籍的非欧洲籍人。又例如“奴役法”，它规定南非政府特设的“劳工局”和遍布各地的所谓
  “土著民族督察官”有权对非洲的劳动人民任意进行审讯和判决，并送往农场或矿场做苦工。再如“镇压共产主义法”，则规定南非政府有无限的权力去限制思想、言论、结社等公民自由。凡是反抗南非政府法西斯统治的党派、团体、集会、出版物或个人，都可以被宣布为非法或违法。其他如“人口登记法”、“土地所有权法”、“公共治安法”、“关于血统纯粹证明施行法”等也都是旨在剥夺非欧洲籍人的政治、经济和社会各方面应该享有的权利的。
    南非的有色人在社会生活中受到的凌辱更是对人类尊严绝大的蔑视。一个非洲工人没有主人签署的许可证，就不能出现在公共场所，不得进入南非所有各城市。甚至非欧洲籍人乘车、走路、购票、打电话都有一定地方，必须和白种人隔离开来。
    不仅如此，南非联邦政府最近还制定了新的法律，准备加重和增加种族歧视，并且调整了立法和司法机构，来加紧镇压南非人民对种族隔离和歧视的反抗。
    南非联邦政府这种种族歧视和民族压迫的政策是为少数欧洲籍矿场主和农场主的巨额利润服务的政策，是在白种人和有色人之间以及有色人和有色人之间、部族和部族之间制造分裂和对立的政策。这种政策是出于矿场主和农场主的要求，他们需要的是廉价而又驯服的劳动力。南非联邦政府的各项野蛮的种族“立法”的作用就是为他们供应有色人的奴隶劳动，并保证不让工人们组织起来进行争取政治和生活权利的斗争。
    但是，南非广大人民并没有在南非联邦政府的高压手段下屈服。南非各族人民愈来愈坚决地为反对种族歧视而斗争，并且不断在斗争中加强了团结。一九五○年六月，南非共产党和非洲人国民大会、南非印度人大会曾发起全国性的政治罢工，反对南非政府颁布的迫害共产党的法律，在这一罢工斗争中，许多白种人工人也同成千上万的非欧洲籍工人站在一条战线上。一九五二年六月，南非历史上空前未有的最大规模的有色人政治运动——“反抗不公正的法律”运动胜利展开了。虽然一百多位社会和工会的领袖们被禁止参加公开活动，八千多人被关入监狱，但是反种族歧视的斗争已经使群众的政治觉悟显著提高了，群众性的抗议集会和示威游行以及罢工斗争曾在各地普遍展开。特别是今年六月间在约翰内斯堡举行的南非民主和自由人民代表大会，来自南非各地的三千多位代表参加了大会，他们一致通过了南非人民的“自由宪章”，他们宣誓将“协力斗争，不惜一切力量和勇气，直到”宪章上“所规定的民主改革……胜利实现为止”。这表明南非人民决心争取民主权利的坚强意志。
    南非各族人民反抗种族歧视、争取人权的斗争是正义的事业，它获得了中国人民和各国人民的同情和声援。今年四月间亚非会议通过的决议，指责南非联邦政府实行的种族隔离和歧视的政策，并且指出“这种行为不仅是对人权的粗暴的侵犯，而且是对文明的基本价值和人类尊严的否认。”这是代表亚非两大洲亿万人民向南非联邦政府发出的抗议和谴责。世界各地反对种族歧视的浪潮正在继续增强，南非人民争取人权和自由的斗争正在向前发展，南非联邦反动统治集团继续这种反动的不人道措施，一定会替它自己招致恶果，正义是终究会得到伸张的。
