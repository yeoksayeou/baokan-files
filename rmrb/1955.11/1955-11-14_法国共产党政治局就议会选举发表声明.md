Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 11th (TASS) - "L'Humanité" published a statement by the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party on the need to unite all democratic forces in the upcoming parliamentary elections. The statement emphasized that in France, the people's movement to change government policies in accordance with the country's vital interests is growing stronger.

The statement said, "The French Communist Party reiterates that it is possible in France to implement a stable and effective policy of left-wing forces. All conditions are in place to reach an agreement based on a program of social justice and democratic progress. The threat of war has diminished. International tensions have eased. The French people advocate a policy of negotiation in North Africa and the establishment of a genuine French Federation. Democratic forces are uniting on the basis of the program of the National Committee for Non-Denominational Schools."

The statement said, "On the other hand, the strength of the people fighting against poverty and for peace is strengthening its ranks on a wide scale. Workers participating in the Socialist Party and the Communist Party are increasingly determined to take the path of joint action. Just as in 1936, the unity of action of the working class can become the decisive factor in an invincible people's movement."

In its statement, the French Communist Party expressed its determination to do everything possible to ensure that the election results in a parliamentary majority that guarantees the implementation of policies that meet the expectations of the people.
