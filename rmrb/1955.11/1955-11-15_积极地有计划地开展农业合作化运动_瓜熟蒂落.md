　　Actively and Systematically Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
    When a Melon is Ripe, it Falls From the Stem
　　Chen Jun
    In September, an agricultural cooperation movement with a broad mass base emerged in the vast rural areas of Hebei Province. In just one month, more than 46,000 new agricultural production cooperatives were established throughout the province; more than 1,629,000 peasant households joined the cooperatives, increasing the proportion of peasant households participating from 35 percent to over 56 percent (as of October 10th). In Baoding Prefecture alone, 16 counties had achieved basic cooperation (70 percent of peasant households had joined the cooperatives). Among them, Anguo, Li County, Boye, and Mancheng counties had more than 80 percent of their peasant households in cooperatives. These simple figures illustrate how rapid and intense the development of the movement was. People saw that when the guiding ideology put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong in his "Report on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was grasped by the whole Party and the broad masses, the socialist movement that had been nurtured and grown in the countryside, under the active demands of the peasants and the strong leadership of the Party, bore fruit and formed a great revolutionary upsurge. "Poor peasants stand tall, middle peasants are overjoyed, when poor and middle peasants organize, production faces no obstacle," millions of peasants straightened their backs, resolutely took the socialist road, and regarded joining the cooperative as an honor. Poor peasants said: Chairman Mao has pointed out the direction for us and given us travel expenses (poor peasant cooperative fund loans), we will pack our bags and wholeheartedly embark on the happy socialist road. A significant portion of the upper-middle peasants realized the general trend, and they said: The socialist road must be taken sooner or later; it is better to take it sooner than later. Some upper-middle peasants heard that they were planned to join the cooperative only in a year or two, and they were very anxious, asking the cadres why they had to join later. The peasants' high enthusiasm for joining the cooperative broke through the original plans of many villages. The rich peasants and the original landlords became more isolated, temporarily disappeared, and did not dare to openly carry out sabotage activities. Currently, rumors have subsided in the rural areas of Hebei Province, and social order is stable.
    Joining the cooperative and taking the socialist road has affected every household in the countryside.
    The First Great Victory
    In this high tide of the cooperation movement, the first test faced by all the newly established and expanded agricultural cooperatives was whether they could complete the wheat planting plan. This year, Hebei Province planned to plant 31 million mu of wheat. However, the weather was not favorable. The crops ripened late this year, and there were several autumn rains, making the land very wet, which delayed the wheat planting time by ten days to half a month compared to previous years. When the autumn crops ripened, the time for planting wheat became urgent. By the end of September and the beginning of October, picking cotton, harvesting corn, digging sweet potatoes, and planting wheat were all squeezed together. Before October 8th, Mancheng County had only planted 40,000 mu of wheat fields, with 180,000 mu still unplanted.
    At this critical juncture, a large number of cooperatives had already been established throughout the province. All cooperatives, whether merged, expanded, or newly established, quickly threw themselves into the race to harvest autumn crops and plant wheat. In the expanded cooperatives, new members were assigned to teams as soon as they joined. The newly established cooperatives organized temporary production teams, unified the organization of manpower and animal power for autumn harvest and wheat planting, and implemented the principle of mutual benefit: the livestock of new members were hired at reasonable prices; manual labor was recorded by piece, the work of autumn harvest was priced equally; the work of planting wheat would be distributed dividends next year. Where animal power was insufficient, human-powered plowing and seeding were organized, with ten people pulling a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow, or eight people pulling a plow. A human-powered plow could plant seven or eight mu per day. In Ding County's Second District alone, more than 18,100 male and female peasants participated in pulling plows and seeders, cultivating 696 mu of land by human power and seeding 1,167 mu. Where manpower was insufficient, women were widely mobilized to participate in autumn harvest and seeding. In the heat of the wheat planting competition, the sound of bells ringing before dawn rose and fell, and even after dark, the fields were filled with singing and shouts. After a tense wheat planting competition, by the end of October, the province had completed and exceeded the wheat planting plan. Cooperatives did their best to support individual households and elderly, weak, orphaned, and disabled households during wheat planting. They said that if the land of individual households and orphaned households could not be planted, the state would receive less grain. Zhangcun and Guoying cooperatives in Qingyuan County, among others, provided six plows and helped new members who lacked animal power to cultivate 100 mu of land in three days, and helped seven orphaned and widowed households plant 24 mu of land.
    This year, fertilizer was generally increased on wheat land. According to statistics from 16 cooperatives in Zhongran Township, Qingyuan County, the amount of fertilizer applied to 4,600 mu of wheat land was: 614,000 jin of manure, 6,160 jin of fertilizer powder, and 6,940 carts of rough fertilizer. There was never so much in previous years. Zhangcun cooperative plowed more than 800 mu of wheat land twice and applied manure. Everyone said: Next year, the crops in this cooperative will definitely grow strong. After planting wheat, 90 peasant households requested to join Zhangcun cooperative.
    In previous years, poor peasants had to beg everywhere to get wheat planted, and they could only plant after those with livestock had finished planting, but they still couldn't plant it all at once. They first had to take advantage of others' free time to borrow livestock to pull back the crops. Then, they would beg people for another chance: "The season is passing, please help me one more time and plow the wheat field." Finally, they would ask people to "save people to the end, lend me livestock to seed the land." Early planting only required ten jin of wheat seeds; late planting required fourteen to eighteen jin. On the same land, early planting would yield seven dou, while late planting would only yield three dou. This year, thanks to the cooperative, the land of poor peasants was planted the same way. That's why some older peasants said: Chairman Mao's direction is really right! I've lived for more than sixty years, and I've never seen anything like this: The wheat seedlings haven't even come out yet, and the wheat has already been planted. The wealthy middle peasants inside and outside the cooperative also discussed it, saying: Looking at the wheat planting of the cooperative, it really looks good.
    The high production enthusiasm of the peasants is also reflected in the fact that peasants are buying livestock in large numbers. Twenty head of livestock were added to Wangpan Township in Qingyuan Second District; it is also reflected in the fact that every household wants to raise pigs. It is now difficult to buy piglets on the market, and a small piglet costs more than ten yuan. Some piglets are reserved before they are even born.
    One of Thousands
    The Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative in Beiguan, Mancheng First District, is one of thousands of cooperatives. The reason for introducing it here is not only because it increased production, nor only because it has now been transformed into an advanced cooperative, but because its development, like millions of such cooperatives, proves with facts the victory of peasants taking the socialist road, and proves the brilliance and correctness of the Party's agricultural cooperation policy, the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, and the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    After the land reform, in 1951, three Party members established a mutual aid team here. In 1952, the socialist awareness of the Party members was raised through Party consolidation. Under the call of the Party, this mutual aid team connected with eleven households and established a cooperative. They worked diligently and increased production in the first year. Despite this, the Party branch and the district committee had not given the cooperative the leadership it deserved. Not a single member of the branch committee joined the cooperative; when the district committee was established, it said that it would definitely help solve the difficulties of the cooperative. But when real difficulties were encountered: wanting to borrow money and buy fertilizer, the cooperative raised them, but they were not resolved. The cooperative cadres had no experience and did not seriously implement the policy of mutual benefit. After the autumn harvest, the district committee not only did not actively strengthen leadership and help them solve problems, but simply proposed "freedom to withdraw from the cooperative," and five middle peasants took the opportunity to withdraw. The remaining six households then scattered. When Li Jindong, the former head of the cooperative, mentioned the dissolution of the cooperative, he reviewed and said: At that time, the Party members in our cooperative were not highly conscious, had no confidence and determination in running the cooperative, and were overwhelmed by capitalism.
    In 1954, after the education of the general line, the branch decided to re-establish the cooperative, with Party members taking the lead and setting an example. All members of the branch committee joined the cooperative, and after connections, it expanded to twenty households; ten of the previous eleven households returned. In this way, the cooperative had a strong leadership core. Under the leadership of the district committee, they worked hard to learn the experience of running the cooperative, implemented the principle of mutual benefit, and set a deadline and interest for the return of livestock and farm tools valued to the cooperative, established a financial system, and strengthened accounting work. Party members and Youth League members took the lead in everything. During the spring plowing, one day, they had just sent the manure to the field, and it was about to rain. The cooperative members rushed to the field and spread more than 130 carts of manure on forty mu of land; after they finished spreading, it rained. The peasants outside the cooperative all said with envy: If it weren't for the cooperative, not to mention forty mu, even four mu of manure wouldn't have been spread. In the spring drought, they carried water to plant cotton; in the summer flood, they actively prevented floods. Although this year suffered natural disasters, each mu of cotton still yielded thirty jin more than individual households, and each mu of corn yielded sixty to seventy jin more. In the past year, this cooperative not only showed the superiority of the cooperative with the facts of overcoming disasters and increasing production, but they also seriously carried out the work of uniting mutual aid teams and individual households. They lent farm tools and livestock to individual households and mutual aid teams, helped individual households and mutual aid teams to resist drought and plant, and mingled with the masses. When they proposed to expand the cooperative before the autumn harvest, the peasants responded enthusiastically. The cooperative suddenly grew from twenty households to seventy-eight households (out of a total of ninety households in the village), and the whole village was cooperativized.
    The production conditions of this cooperative are not very good. After the expansion of the cooperative, there were a total of 1,036 mu of land (of which 700 mu were planted with cotton), 58 male laborers, and 98 female laborers. There were only two mules, one horse, and eight donkeys for draft animals. They relied entirely on diligence and thrift in running the cooperative, overcoming difficulties, and increasing production. This year, the average yield of wheat per mu was 202 jin; the average yield of cotton per mu was 130 to 160 jin (farmers outside the cooperative yielded at most 100 jin); the average yield of corn per mu was 180 jin (farmers outside the cooperative yielded only 140 jin per mu), greatly increasing the income of cooperative members.
    Their path is correct. However, in July and August of this year, they still dared not believe in themselves, doubting whether it was too fast to develop from eleven households to seventy-eight households and cooperativize the whole village in three years; they couldn't figure out what to do next. Comrade Mao Zedong's report dispelled their ideological concerns and strengthened their confidence, and they were greatly encouraged. After the county Party congress in early September, the branch studied the need to transform from a primary cooperative to an advanced cooperative. After repeated discussions at the Party member and Youth League member congress, the cooperative management committee, and the cooperative member congress, they realized the benefits of transforming to an advanced cooperative and decided to transform.
    Due to the development of production, the number of dividends per work day in this cooperative has greatly increased: it was 1.4 yuan in 1954 and 2 yuan in 1955. According to their estimates, it can reach 3.4 yuan in 1956. And because the proportion of land dividends has been reduced year by year (land accounted for 50% and labor 50% in 1954, and land accounted for 40% and labor 60% in 1955), it has further improved the labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members, weakened the concept of relying on land, and created conditions for transforming to an advanced cooperative, abolishing land dividends, and implementing remuneration according to labor. Of course, for the elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households lacking labor, abolishing land dividends would reduce their income compared to the present. The cooperative decided to allocate light jobs (such as raising chickens, raising pigs, and watching the fields) to the elderly and weak in a planned way according to different circumstances; on the other hand, use public welfare funds to subsidize households in difficulty to ensure that the four households in the whole cooperative who have difficulties due to the abolition of land dividends will not have problems with their lives.
    The development process of the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative from small to large, from primary to advanced, is in line with the laws of practical movement development. It vividly illustrates the superiority of cooperatives and proves that as long as there is a clear direction, the Party's cooperation policy is seriously implemented, production is fully promoted, and the cooperative is run diligently and thriftily, then any cooperative under the leadership of the Party will achieve the same development.
    The Arrival of the High Tide
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, like in the whole country, promoted the early arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement in Hebei Province and ensured the healthy development of the movement.
    Wang Zhaoxiang, Secretary of the Banbidian Branch of the Communist Party of China in Ding County, said: "Before hearing Chairman Mao's instructions, I planned to divide our village's cooperative of forty households into smaller parts, fearing that it would be difficult to lead if there were too many, and that I would be tired and not be thanked. This was my lazy thinking error in the socialist revolution, and I was fortunate that Chairman Mao corrected me. Now, we will not only not divide the small cooperatives, but also expand the cooperative to one hundred households."
    Su Ming'er, the Secretary of the sub-branch in another village, said: "Last year, in order to cope with the situation, I organized a small cooperative of eight households. This spring, taking advantage of the superior's proposal to reorganize the cooperative, I dissolved it. Because my own awareness was not high, I did not actively lead the peasants to take the socialist road, so our whole village has not established a cooperative. In the future, we must actively lead the peasants in the whole village to run the cooperative well."
    Under the teachings of Chairman Mao, the cadres and Party members who had been passive in the past became active. Comrades who could not find their direction in the past have now found their direction. Comrades who insisted on running cooperatives under the rumors of "too many, too fast" in the past, but were in an illegal position, have now raised their heads. Many Party members in rural villages, who had half or even more than half who had not joined cooperatives in the past, have now joined cooperatives in the vast majority. More than 1,900 of the 2,000 Party members in Ding County's Second District have joined cooperatives. All the Party members in Qingyuan County's Second District have joined cooperatives. The whole Party has been mobilized, actively acted, united the broad masses, and formed an invincible force.
    This spring, a rumor spread, insisting that many difficulties were due to the poor management of cooperatives. The Secretary of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China recalled the situation at that time, saying that at that time, wherever he went, he could hear voices blaming the cooperatives, saying that 50% of the cooperatives in the county were not consolidated and would reduce production. But the fact is exactly the opposite, 90% of the cooperatives increased production this year. This is not only the situation in Qingyuan County, but also the situation in the whole of Hebei Province. The cooperatives showed their superiority, proved that they would lead the peasants to a good life, and encouraged the broad masses of peasants to respond to the call of the Party with unprecedented enthusiasm. It is by no means accidental that more than 1.6 million peasant households joined cooperatives in Hebei Province in one month, but the inevitable result of thousands of old cooperatives showing their superiority.
    After the high tide of the cooperation movement arrived, the broad masses of cadres fully utilized the existing experience. This time, all the cooperatives in Hebei Province immediately grasped wheat planting as soon as they were established. And autumn harvest and wheat planting were done together, using the method of recording work points and settling accounts separately. These are also not accidental, but the grassroots cadres have deeply understood from the past experience of running cooperatives that the first step to consolidate the cooperative is to do a good job in production. Wheat planting and autumn plowing cannot miss the season, and the work of assessing land, livestock, and farm tools and formulating cooperative regulations must go through many discussions and take a lot of energy and time, which will inevitably divert strength. This year, it is precisely because wheat planting was grasped tightly and production was done well that the peasants were further educated with facts, and they more deeply recognized the superiority of the cooperative and consolidated the enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperative. This may seem very ordinary, but it just proves that the cooperative movement in recent years has cultivated a large number of cadres and accumulated rich experience, preparing the conditions for the great development of cooperatives.
    In this movement, it can also be clearly found that the leadership level of the Party committees at all levels and the broad masses of cadres has greatly improved. They understand the use of concrete class analysis methods to carry out planning (although some areas are still planning very crudely), which ensures the implementation of the Party's class policy, so that the cooperation movement has a core force dominated by poor and lower-middle peasant activists, and prevents rich peasants, landlords, and counter-revolutionaries from mixing into cooperatives, forming the "three more" characteristics of this movement: more Party members, more Youth League members, and more poor peasants. They understand to actively and boldly lead the masses to take the socialist road, believe in the masses, and rely on the branch, so that this cooperative work has changed from being done by cadres to being done by the masses, from being done by a few people to being done by the majority, forming a broad mass movement. They understand how to effectively carry out socialist education, universally train Party members and Youth League members, organize huge propaganda teams, and vividly publicize socialism with practical examples. They also understand the leadership methods of grasping key points and convening experience exchange meetings to promote work. All of this has greatly strengthened the Party's leadership over the cooperation movement and ensured that the development of the movement is both fast and fierce and is advancing along a healthy path.
    Of course, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Deviations are inevitable in the movement, which is understandable and not difficult to correct." In the high tide of the cooperation movement in Hebei Province, a few areas have crude planning, have not seriously publicized and implemented the policy of relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, and there have been individual phenomena of excluding poor peasants in the establishment of cooperatives; some have adopted methods of convening large meetings and parades to call on people to join cooperatives without cultivating backbones, without in-depth publicity, and without planning, resulting in a rush or compulsory orders. Although these deviations only appear in a few areas, they cannot be paralyzed, and they are worthy of the deep attention of the Party committees at all levels and helping the lower-level Party organizations to correct them, so as to truly make the cooperatives run quickly, in large numbers, and well.
    Of course, the great development of cooperatives has also brought many new situations and problems. Expanded cooperatives, large cooperatives merged from small cooperatives, and newly established cooperatives, cooperatives that have transformed from primary to advanced, all have their own different problems that need to be specifically studied and solved. In the great development, many tasks have not been able to be done meticulously, such as the autumn harvest distribution work of old cooperatives, the evaluation of land, livestock, and farm tools of new cooperatives, the formulation of cooperative regulations, the establishment of institutions, etc., all need to be carried out in a timely manner, and if delayed for a long time, it will also cause chaos. Also, some counties, some districts, and some townships have already exposed weak leadership or even ineffective leadership. How should the superior Party committees further strengthen the specific leadership over there and reverse the backward situation? Obviously, we can no longer just be satisfied with holding experience exchange meetings and giving general policy guidance. In addition, how to combine Party building and consolidation with cooperative building and consolidation, how to make the work of the Party adapt to the requirements of the new situation, and even how to make all aspects of work in the countryside catch up with the development of the cooperation movement. These problems need to be solved one by one in the work of fully turning to consolidation.
    Hebei Province is an old area that was liberated earlier. The cooperation movement has appeared in an unprecedented high tide on the basis of a solid foundation and full preparation. People are celebrating this great new victory. But we must never be overwhelmed by victory, but we must work harder to consolidate and develop this victory and carry out in-depth and detailed work to carefully consolidate and run the cooperative well!

　　积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    瓜熟蒂落
　　陈浚
    具有广大群众规模的农业合作化运动，九月间，出现在河北省的广大农村里。前后不过一个月的时间，全省农业生产合作社已经新建了四万六千多个；一百六十二万九千多农户入了社，入社农户从原有的占总农户百分之三十五上升到百分之五十六以上（截至十月十日的统计）。只是保定专区，就有十六个县实现了基本合作化（百分之七十的农户入了社）。其中安国、蠡县、博野、满城四县入社农户超过了百分之八十。这些简单的数字，说明了运动的发展，是何等迅速、猛烈。人们看到了，当毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告所提出的指导思想为全党和广大群众所掌握的时候，在农村里孕育成长起来的社会主义运动，在农民的积极要求和党的坚强领导下，瓜熟蒂落，形成了伟大的革命热潮。“贫农挺胸膛，中农喜洋洋，贫农中农组织起，生产无阻挡”，千百万农民直起腰干，坚决走社会主义的道路，以入社为光荣。贫农说：毛主席给我们指出了方向，又发给了路费（贫农合作基金贷款），我们要背起行李，一心一意走上社会主义的幸福道路。不小一部分上中农，认识到大势所趋，他们说：社会主义道路，迟早要走；迟走不如早走。有些上中农听说自己在规划里要过一年两年才得入社，就很着急，去问干部为什么得晚入社。农民入社的高度热情，突破了许多乡村原来的规划。富农和原来的地主，更加孤立，暂时销声匿迹，不敢公开进行破坏活动，目前河北省的农村里谣风熄灭，社会秩序安定。
    入社，走社会主义的道路，牵动了农村里的每一户人家。
    第一个大胜仗
    在这一次合作化运动的高潮里，一切新建的和扩大的农业合作社，遇到的第一个考验，就是能不能完成种麦的计划。河北省今年计划种麦三千一百万亩。可是，天不作美，今年庄稼熟得晚，又下了几场秋雨，地很湿，使得种麦的时间比往年推迟了十天到半个月。秋庄稼熟了，种麦的时间也紧迫了。到九月底十月初，摘棉花，收玉米，刨甘薯，种麦子，都挤到了一起。满城县在十月八日以前，全县只种了四万亩麦田，还有十八万亩没种上。
    就在这个紧急的关头，全省的合作社已经大量建立起来。所有的合作社，不管是合并的、扩大的和新建的，都迅速投入了种麦收秋的竞赛。在扩大的社里，新社员随入随编队。新建的合作社编起临时生产队，统一组织人力畜力秋收种麦，并且贯彻执行了互利原则：对新社员的牲口，一律雇用，工价合理；人工按件记工，秋收的工，齐工找价；种麦的工，明年分红。畜力不足，组织了人力耕地拉耧，有的是十个人拉一张双轮双铧犁，也有的八个人拉一张犁的。人拉的犁，一天能种到七八亩。光是定县二区，参加拉犁拉耧的男女农民就达到一万八千一百多人，人力耕地六百九十六亩，耩地一千一百六十七亩。人力不足，普遍发动妇女参加秋收、耩地。在种麦的竞赛热潮里，天没亮钟声此落彼起，天黑了，地里还到处是歌声和吆喝声。经过紧张的种麦竞赛，到十月底，全省完成和超过了种麦计划。合作社在种麦时候尽力支援单干户和孤寡没劳力的农户。他们说，要是单干户，孤寡户的地种不上，国家就会少收粮食。清苑县张存、郭营等四个社，出了六犋犁，三天帮助缺乏畜力的新社耕了一百亩地，帮助七户孤寡户种了二十四亩地。
    今年的麦地，普遍增加了肥料。据清苑县中冉乡十六个社的统计，在四千六百亩麦地里，施肥的数量是：大粪六十一万四千斤，肥田粉六千一百六十斤，粗肥六千九百四十车。往年远没有这么多。张存社八百多亩麦地都耕了两遍，上了大粪。人人都说：明年这个社的庄稼一定长得壮。种麦以后，有九十户农民要求参加张存社。
    往年，贫农为了种麦得到处央告人，要等有牲口户种完了，才能种，可是还不能一次种上。他们先得趁别人的空，借牲口拉回庄稼。再等机会央告人家：“节令要过了，再帮助一次，把麦地给耕一下”。最后，求人“救人救到底，借借牲口把地耩上”。早种的，只要用十斤麦籽；种迟了，要用十四斤到十八斤。一样的地，早种的收七斗，迟种的只能收三斗。今年靠了合作社，贫农的地一样种上了。这就是为什么有好些上了岁数的农民说：毛主席指点的道路真对！我活了六十多岁，从来没见过这样的事：麦苗还没有出来，麦子都种完了。社里社外的富裕中农也纷纷议论着，他们说：看合作社种麦的光景，真像个样子。
    农民生产情绪的高涨，还表现在农民大买牲口，清苑二区王盘乡添了二十头牲口；还表现在家家户户要养猪，现在市场上很难买到小猪，一个小猪要十几块钱。有的小猪还没生下来，就有人指腹定下了。
    千万个中的一个
    满城一区北关的先锋农业合作社，是成千成万个社中的一个。这里所以要介绍它，不单是由于它增产了，也不单是由于它现在已经转成了高级社，而是由于它的发展，像千百万个这样的社一样，用事实证明了农民走社会主义道路的胜利，证明了党的农业合作化方针、七届六中全会决议和毛泽东同志指示的英明和正确。
    土地改革以后，一九五一年，三个党员在这里成立了一个互助组。一九五二年，经过整党，提高了党员的社会主义觉悟。在党的号召下，这个互助组串连了十一户，建立了合作社。他们辛勤劳动，第一年就增产了。虽然如此，但是，党的支部和区委一直没有对这个社给予应有的领导，支委没有一个入社；区委在社成立的时候，曾说，社有困难问题一定帮助解决。可是到了碰到真的困难：要贷款，要买肥料，合作社提出来，都没有得到解决。社干部没有经验，又没有认真执行互利政策。秋收后，区委不但没有积极加强领导，帮助他们解决问题，反而简单地提出“出社自由”，五户中农就势退了社。剩下的六户接着都散了。当时的社长李金栋提起散社的事，检讨说：当时，我们社里的党员觉悟不高，办社没有信心和决心，被资本主义压倒了。
    一九五四年，经过总路线的教育，支部决定重新办社，党员带头，做出榜样。支部委员全体都入了社，经过串连，扩大到二十户；以前的十一户，回来了十户。这样，社里就有了坚强的领导核心。他们在区委领导下，努力学习了办社的经验，执行互利的原则，折价归社的牲畜和农具都订出归还的期限和利息，建立了财务制度，加强了会计工作。党员、团员事事带头。春耕的时候，有一天，他们刚把粪送到地里，天要下雨了，社员纷纷赶到地里，把一百三十多车粪扬到四十亩地里；扬完了，雨下来了。社外的农民都羡慕地说：要不是合作社，不用说四十亩，就是四亩地的粪也扬不完啊。春旱了，他们挑水点种棉花；夏涝了，他们又积极防涝。虽然这年遭了天灾，每亩棉花仍比单干户多摘三十斤，每亩玉米多打六十斤到七十斤。一年以来，这个社不但用战胜灾荒和增产的事实显出了合作社的优越性，他们还认真进行了团结互助组和单干户的工作。借给单干户和互助组农具牲畜，帮助单干户和互助组抗旱点种，同群众打成一片。当他们在秋收前提出扩大合作社的号召的时候，农民热烈响应。这个社一下子由二十户发展到七十八户（全村共九十户），全村合作化了。
    这个社的生产条件并不是很好的。社扩大以后，共有土地一千零三十六亩（其中七百亩种棉花），男劳动力五十八个，女劳动力九十八个。耕畜只有两头骡子、一匹马、八头毛驴。他们全靠勤俭办社，克服了困难，增加了生产。今年麦子每亩平均收了二百零二斤；棉花每亩平均摘了一百三十斤到一百六十斤（社外的农民最多收一百斤）；玉米每亩平均收一百八十斤（社外农民每亩只收一百四十斤），大大增加了社员的收入。
    他们的道路走对了。可是，在今年七、八月间，他们还不敢相信自己，怀疑三年里从十一户发展到七十八户，全村合作化了，是不是快了；摸不清下一步应该怎么办。毛泽东同志的报告解除了他们的思想顾虑，增强了他们的信心，他们受到了极大鼓舞。九月初，县党代会以后，支部研究了要由初级社转到高级社，经过党员、团员大会、社管理委员会、社员大会的多次讨论，认识到转到高级社的好处，决定转成高级社。
    由于生产的发展，这个社每个劳动日分红的数目大大提高了：一九五四年是一元四角，一九五五年是二元，据他们预计，一九五六年可以达到三元四角。并且由于逐年降低了土地分红的比例（一九五四年是地五劳五，一九五五年是地四劳六）进一步提高了社员的劳动积极性，削弱了依靠土地的观念，为转到高级社，取消土地分红，实行按劳取酬，创造了条件。当然，对于缺乏劳力的老弱孤寡户来说，取消了土地分红，他们的收入是会比现在减少的。社里决定根据不同的情况，一方面有计划地分配老弱做轻巧的活（如养鸡、养猪、看场等）；另一方面，用公益金补助困难户，保证全社由于取消土地分红发生困难的四户，生活不成问题。
    先锋农业合作社从小到大，从低级到高级的发展过程，是合乎实际运动发展的规律的。它生动地说明了合作社的优越性，证明了只要有了明确的方向，认真执行了党的合作化政策，全力搞好生产，勤俭办社，那末，在党的领导下的任何一个合作社，都会获得同样的发展。
    高潮的到来
    毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会的决议，像在全国范围内一样，它促进了这次河北省农业合作化运动高潮的早日到来，并且保证了运动的健康发展。
    中共定县板辟店支部书记王兆祥说：“没有听见毛主席指示以前，打算把我们村的一个四十户的社再分小一点，怕多了不好领导，挨了累还落不是。这是我在社会主义革命中偷懒的错误思想，幸亏毛主席纠正了我。现在，我们不但不分小社，并且要把社扩大到一百户。”
    另一个村的分支部书记苏明尔说：“去年为了应付局面，组织了一个八户的小社，今年春天，趁着上级提出整社的时候，就把它解散了。由于自己的觉悟不高，不积极领导农民走社会主义的道路，使我们全村一直没有办起合作社。今后，一定要积极领导全村农民办好合作社。”
    在毛主席的教导下，过去态度消极的干部和党员积极起来了。过去摸不清方向的同志看准了方向了。过去在“办多了、办快了”的谣风之下，坚持办社，但是处于不合法地位的同志，抬起头来了。许多乡村中的党员，过去有一半，甚至一半以上没有入社的，现在绝大多数都入了社。定县二区二千多党员里，一千九百多个入了社。清苑县二区的党员，全部入了社。全党动员起来，积极行动起来，团结了广大群众，形成了不可战胜的力量。
    今年春天，刮起过一股谣风，硬说许多困难的发生都是由于合作社办糟了。中共清苑县委书记回忆当时的情况说，那时候，走到那里，都可以听到责备合作社的声音，说全县合作社百分之五十不巩固，要减产。可是，事实呢，恰恰相反，百分之九十的社今年增了产。这不只是清苑县的情况，也是全河北省的情况。合作社显示了自己的优越性，证明了它将带领农民走上美好生活的道路，鼓舞了广大农民，空前热烈地响应了党的号召。河北省在一个月里一百六十多万户农民入社，绝不是偶然的，而是千百个老社显示了优越性的必然结果。
    在合作化运动高潮到来之后，广大干部充分运用了已有的经验。这一次全河北省所有的合作社，一建立起来，立刻抓紧种麦。并且秋收种麦一起干，采用记工的办法，分别结算。这些，也都不是偶然的，而是基层干部已经从过去的办社的经验中，深深地懂得了巩固社的第一着是搞好生产。种麦和秋耕地都不能错过节令，而进行评土地、评牲口、评农具和订社章等等工作，又必然要经过许多次讨论，要花费较大的精力和时间，这就必然会分散力量。今年正由于抓紧了种麦，搞好了生产，就进一步用事实教育农民，更加深刻地认识到合作社的优越性，把群众入社的热情巩固起来。这一点，看上去也许很平常，但是，它恰恰证明了：几年来的合作化运动，已培养了大批干部，积累了丰富的经验，为合作社的大发展准备了条件。
    在这次运动里，也可以显著地发现各级党委和广大干部的领导水平大大提高了。他们懂得了运用具体的阶级分析的方法，去进行规划（尽管有些地区还规划得很粗糙），这就保证了党的阶级政策的贯彻执行，从而使合作化运动有了以贫农和下中农积极分子为主的核心力量，并防止了富农、地主和反革命分子混入合作社，形成了这次运动中“三多”的特点：党员多、团员多、贫农多。他们懂得了积极、大胆地领导群众走社会主义的道路，相信群众，依靠支部，使这次办社工作，由干部办变成了由群众办，由少数人办变成由多数人办，形成了广阔的群众性的运动。他们懂得了怎样有效地去进行社会主义的教育，普遍训练党员团员，组织巨大的宣传队伍，用实际的事例，生动地宣传社会主义。他们也懂得了抓重点，召开经验交流会，推动工作的领导方法。这一切，大大加强了党对合作化运动的领导，保证了运动的发展既快又猛，并且是沿着健康的道路前进的。
    当然，正像毛泽东同志所指出的：“运动中免不了要出些偏差，这是可以理解的，也是不难纠正的”。河北省在合作化运动的高潮里，少数地区有规划粗糙，没有认真宣传和执行依靠贫农和下中农的政策，在建社中发生排斥贫农的个别现象；有不经培养骨干、不经深入宣传，不规划，而采取开大会、游行示威的办法号召入社，发生了一哄而起或强迫命令的现象。这些偏差虽然只出现在少数地区，但是不能麻痹，值得各级党委深切注意和帮助下级党组织加以纠正，才能真正做到把社办得又快又多又好。
    当然，合作社的大发展，也带来了不少新的情况和问题，扩大的社，小社合并的大社和新建的社，由初级转到高级的社，都有各自不同的问题，需要加以具体研究和解决。在大发展中，许多工作还来不及细致地去做，如老社的秋收分配工作，新社的评定土地、牲畜、农具，制定社章，建立机构等等，都是需要及时进行的，拖久了，也会引起混乱。又如有些县，有些区，有些乡，已经暴露了领导薄弱，甚至领导不力的情况，上级党委怎样去进一步加强对那里的具体领导、扭转落后情况呢？显然的，我们已经不能只满足于开开经验交流会，给予一般的方针指导。此外，如何在建社整社中结合建党整党，如何使党的工作适应于新的形势的要求，以至如何使农村中各方面的工作都赶上合作化运动的发展。这些问题，需要在全力转向巩固工作中，逐一加以解决的。
    河北省是解放较早的老区，合作化运动是在有了牢固的基础和充分的准备的条件之上，出现了空前规模的高潮。人们都在庆祝这个伟大的新胜利。但是决不能被胜利冲昏头脑，而要更加努力地巩固和发展这一个胜利，进行深入和细致的工作认真把社整好办好！
