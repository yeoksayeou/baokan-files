    Over a Million People Visited the Soviet Exhibition in Guangzhou
    Six Hundred Thousand Visitors Purchased Soviet Goods Sold in the Sales Department
    Since the opening of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction in Guangzhou a month ago, the number of visitors has exceeded one million.
    The visitors included people from all walks of life and ethnic minorities from Guangzhou and Guangdong Province, as well as from provinces in the Central and South China region, compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, and overseas Chinese.
    Most of the people who came to visit from various counties in Guangdong Province were farmers preparing to participate in agricultural production cooperatives. Some traveled by night or paddled wooden boats along the Pearl River, while others traveled by car and boat for several days. Farmers often visited for two or three consecutive days. They paid particular attention to the agricultural machinery in the Industry Pavilion and the Agriculture Pavilion. They were particularly impressed by the mechanization and high yields of rice and various technical crops in the Soviet Union. Deng Ying, a farmer from Guangning County, said after the visit: "I am really stupid, I only now truly believe in the benefits of agricultural cooperation and using machines to farm. I will resolutely request to join an agricultural production cooperative when I go back this time, and I will also promote it well to others."
    Luo Xikeng, a young worker from Foshan City, Guangdong Province, wrote a poem on the spot after the visit, depicting the young audience's vision of future life after the visit.
    Jiang Kaisong, an overseas Chinese who recently returned from the United States, wrote a letter to the exhibition. The letter said: I have personally seen the most advanced science and technology in the world. I am convinced that it is not socialist Soviet Union that is lagging behind, but capitalist America.
    In the exhibition's book of impressions, an elderly person left neatly written characters with a brush: "The Soviet Union is advanced, guiding the backward; socialism, striding forward!" A soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote his oath in the book of impressions, saying: "Build, motherland! I will defend you!" (Xinhua News Agency)
    The Soviet goods sold in the sales department of the Exhibition of Achievements in Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction, which is being held in Guangzhou, have been extremely welcomed by the audience. Nearly 880,000 Soviet goods have been sold in the month since the exhibition opened, and 600,000 visitors have come to purchase goods.
    The goods sold in the exhibition's sales department include more than 270 varieties of hardware, cosmetics, food, stationery, and toys. The exhibition's sales department has adopted methods such as daily quotas, and selling in batches and in different locations to meet the demand of most visitors to purchase Soviet goods.
    The audience was very satisfied after buying Soviet goods. A farmer who bought a tin of candy said: "I will take it back and let my fellow farmers taste the candy from Moscow, and I will keep this beautiful tin as a permanent souvenir." (Xinhua News Agency)

    百多万人参观了在广州举行的苏联展览会
    六十万观众选购了卖品部出售的苏联商品
    苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会在广州开幕一个月以来，观众超过一百万人。
    观众中有来自广州市和广东省以及中南地区各省的各界人民和少数民族，还有来自香港、澳门的同胞和海外华侨。
    从广东省各县来参观的人们中多数是准备参加农业生产合作社的农民。他们有些是乘夜走路或沿着珠江划木艇前来的，也有的乘车搭船经过好些天路程才到达。农民们往往连续参观两三天。他们特别细致地参观了工业馆的农业机器和农业馆。苏联的水稻及各种技术作物耕作的机械化和高产量特别打动他们的心。广宁县农民妇女邓英参观后说：“我真笨，到现在才真正相信农业合作化和用机器种田的好处。我这次回去坚决要求参加农业生产合作社，还要向别人好好宣传。”
    广东省佛山市青年工人罗锡铿参观后，当场写了一首诗，描绘出青年观众在参观后对于未来生活的憧憬。
    一个最近才从美国归国的华侨江开淞给展览会写了一封信。信上说：我亲眼见到了世界上最先进的科学技术。我确信落在后头的不是社会主义的苏联，而是资本主义的美国。
    在展览会的感想书中，留下了一个老年人用毛笔写的端端正正的字：“苏联先进，诱掖后进；社会主义，大步迈进！”一个中国人民解放军战士在感想簿上写下了他的誓言说：“你建设吧，祖国！我保卫你！”（新华社）
    正在广州举行的苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会卖品部出售的苏联商品，受到了观众极大的欢迎。展览会开幕一个月来出售的苏联商品近八十八万件，来选购商品的观众达六十万人。
    展览会卖品部出售的商品包括：五金杂品、化妆品、食品、文具和玩具等二百七十多种。展览会卖品部采取了按日定量、分批分地出售等办法，满足了大部分观众购买苏联商品的要求。
    观众们买到苏联商品后十分满意。一个买了铁盒糖的农民说：“我回去要给农民兄弟尝尝从莫斯科来的糖，这漂亮的铁盒还要留作永久纪念。”（新华社）
