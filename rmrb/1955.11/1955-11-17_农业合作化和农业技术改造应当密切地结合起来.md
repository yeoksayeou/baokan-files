    Agricultural Cooperation and Agricultural Technical Transformation Should Be Closely Integrated
    Bo Yibo
    Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the socialist transformation movement of agriculture in our country is developing rapidly and healthily. The main aspect of this movement is agricultural cooperation, that is, the socialist transformation of agriculture; it also has another important aspect, which is agricultural mechanization, electrification, and chemicalization, that is, the technical transformation of agriculture. The basic economic law of socialism is to ensure the maximum satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the entire society by means of the continuous growth and continuous improvement of socialist production on a highly technical basis. From this, we can understand the important significance of a high technical basis for building a socialist economy. Under the specific conditions of our country, completing the technical transformation of agriculture will take more time than completing the socialist transformation of agriculture. However, we must never relax our active efforts in the technical transformation of agriculture. The technical transformation of agriculture should meet the needs of the socialist transformation of agriculture and promote the rapid advancement of the socialist transformation of agriculture.
    Here, I would first like to mention the internal connection between the country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture. Socialist industrialization must be strongly supported by agriculture. Industry is the main body of the entire national economy, including agriculture, but in order for it to develop fully and comprehensively, agriculture must have a corresponding improvement. Because agriculture is first of all the main market for absorbing industrial products, the supplier of industrial raw materials and commercial grain, and at the same time a reliable reserve force for exporting materials to exchange for machinery from foreign countries for the development of our country's industry. Among them, the issue of commercial grain deserves our attention even more. The grain difficulties that occurred in the Soviet Union in 1928 were caused by the mismatch between the development of agriculture and the development of industry. At that time, industry had recovered to the pre-war level of 1913, but agriculture was still lower than before the war, and grain production was only 91 percent of the pre-war level, especially the commercial grain rate was only 13 percent. From 1925 to 1928, the output of socialist large-scale industry increased by an average of 27 percent per year; however, the output of agriculture increased by an average of only 2.6 percent per year. At that time, the commercial grain that agriculture could supply was only equivalent to 37 percent of that before the war, which shows that it is impossible to solve the increasing need for commercial grain by relying solely on the individual economies of poor and middle peasants. Precisely for this reason, the Soviet Union then formulated the policy of accelerating the collectivization of agriculture to match the development of industry. It is impossible to imagine that our people's democratic dictatorship state led by the working class can be built on the basis of this lopsided combination of socialist large-scale industry and small-scale peasant economy for a long time. 110 million peasant households are the base from which our country's cooperation starts. We must be cautious. We can only adopt the method of education and persuasion towards the peasants, and we cannot force or order them. This is a firm and unwavering attitude towards the peasants under any circumstances; but it must be transformed in a planned and step-by-step manner, and it cannot be stagnant. As Stalin said: "We need neither the cursers of the individual peasant economy nor its eulogizers." Either we solve this historical task, then the final victory of socialism in our country will be guaranteed; or we cannot solve this historical task, then let capitalism occupy the rural front and finally restore it throughout the country. It can be seen that agricultural cooperation and socialist industrialization are closely related internally, and isolated views are incorrect. Below, I will talk about the issue of agricultural cooperation and agricultural technical transformation should be closely integrated.
    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "We are now not only carrying out a revolution in the social system from private ownership to public ownership, but also a revolution in technology from handicraft production to large-scale modern machine production, and these two revolutions are combined together." The socialist transformation of agriculture, under the specific conditions of our country, is first of all to implement cooperation. The collective labor of cooperation will greatly improve agricultural productivity and gradually cultivate the habit of socialist collective labor among farmers. However, to fundamentally change the backward state of agricultural production and transform the cooperated farmers into complete and thorough socialist laborers, it is also necessary to implement technical transformation, that is, gradually adopt modern technologies such as tractors, agricultural machinery, trucks, chemical fertilizers, and electrification. Only on the basis of agricultural cooperation can modern technology be fully adopted, and improved day by day, constantly replacing old technologies with new technologies, replacing new technologies with newer technologies, continuously increasing the yield per unit area on the basis of new technologies, and reclaiming wasteland on a large scale, only in this way can it be possible to greatly and continuously improve the productivity of agriculture. Only after agricultural production has reached a high level of development can the superiority of cooperation be further demonstrated and fully realized. After agricultural cooperation, the agricultural production relations have been changed to a semi-socialist or socialist nature, which will cultivate the habit of socialist collective labor among farmers; but if the technology still remains at the level of manual labor, it will be difficult or even impossible to completely and thoroughly change the conservative and individualistic habits of small producers. Therefore, the comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture is also the necessary material basis for further socialist transformation of farmers. It can be seen that it is completely necessary to implement technical transformation on the basis of cooperation, but emphasizing the necessity of technical transformation is by no means and must not underestimate or slightly underestimate the great significance of cooperation. On the contrary, under the conditions of our country, it is fundamentally impossible to implement the technical transformation of agriculture without cooperation. Because modern agricultural technology is based on large-scale production, it is impossible to adopt modern agricultural technologies such as tractors without first implementing cooperation to expand the scale of agricultural production. Therefore, agricultural cooperation and the technical transformation of agriculture must be closely integrated.
    Some people are very worried that the technical transformation of agriculture will inevitably save a lot of labor, and the population of our country is already large. Where will the surplus labor and natural growth go? I think it is necessary to raise this question and consider it, but it is unfounded to worry about the increase in labor. We want to carry out technical transformation of the entire national economy, including agriculture, in order to transform our country from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country, and to improve the labor productivity of our country. It is certain that the implementation of technical transformation will save more labor. According to Soviet statistics in 1937, after the full implementation of technical transformation in agriculture, that is, the full application of tractors, agricultural machinery, trucks, chemical fertilizers, and electrification, its labor productivity will be more than 25 times higher than that of manual individual labor productivity, and 15 times higher than that of animal-drawn farm implements. This is exactly what we want. Only in this way can we further develop our country's rich resources and further improve the productivity of our country's industry and agriculture, as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Only when China has thoroughly completed the socialist transformation in terms of social and economic systems, and also uses machine operations in the technical aspect, in all departments and places where machine operations can be used, can the entire social and economic outlook be changed." After the implementation of technical transformation in agriculture, there are many ways out for the saved labor: first, due to the large-scale development of industry, it will continue to absorb a large number of labor, including labor directly participating in industrial construction and labor required in various aspects serving industry; second, large-scale reclamation of wasteland in agriculture, construction of new agricultural bases, increase in technical crops, and development of various agricultural economies all require continuous increase in a large number of labor; third, the development of transportation, postal and telecommunications, and commercial departments in line with industrial and agricultural construction will also need to continue to increase a lot of labor; fourth, following this, science, culture, and education will also develop greatly, and also need to continue to increase a large number of labor. In addition, in the entire process of industrialization and agricultural cooperation, we will open up and develop many new departments and new occupations in industry and agriculture, such as the operation and management of cooperatives, farm tool repair, etc., which will need to continuously absorb a lot of labor. To repeat, large-scale reclamation of wasteland and the establishment of new agricultural bases will be the main outlet for a large amount of surplus labor in our country. Therefore, even if some phenomena of surplus agricultural labor occur in the technical transformation of agriculture, it can only be a short-term, temporary phenomenon and cannot become a fundamental problem.
    However, the implementation of a comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture is by no means a simple matter. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Due to our country's economic conditions, the time for technical reform will be longer than the time for social reform." It is estimated that it will take about four to five five-year plans, that is, twenty years to twenty-five years, to basically complete the technical reform in agriculture nationwide." This estimate is completely correct. It took the Soviet Union about three five-year plans to basically complete the technical transformation of agriculture. Our country's economy is backward, especially industry is still very backward, and our country is a country with a large population and a vast territory. It will take considerable time and effort to raise agriculture from its current backward level to a modern level. Completing the comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture in twenty to twenty-five years is quite urgent for us.
    Let us cite a few figures for examination.
    By the end of our country's first five-year plan, the planting area of ​​the country's land will reach more than 2.27 billion mu, which is not much different from the 2.34 billion mu in the Soviet Union in 1952; however, the level of agricultural technology that our country can reach when the first five-year plan is completed is very different from the current level in the Soviet Union. According to incomplete statistics: at the beginning of 1954, the Soviet Union had 1.3 million standard tractors (converted to 15 horsepower traction), with an annual output of 183,000 standard tractors. In 1953, state-owned farms, collective farms, and tractor stations had 370,000 trucks. The production plan for chemical fertilizers in 1955 was 9.4 million tons, and it is planned to reach 28 million to 30 million tons in 1964. In 1953, the total capacity of rural power stations was 1.5 million kilowatts, and more than one-fifth of the collective farms, 90 percent of the state-owned farms, and 95 percent of the tractor stations in the Soviet Union had been electrified.
    The situation in our country is very backward. We only started building our own tractor factory and automobile factory during the first five-year plan, and started producing a small number of tractors and a small number of trucks at the end of the five-year plan. The production of chemical fertilizers was only 590,000 tons in 1957. As for agricultural electrification, the gap is even greater. At present, only a small number of state-owned farms and cooperatives use a small amount of electricity.
    It can be seen that it will be a very arduous task to raise our country's agricultural technology level to the current level of the Soviet Union during the four to five five-year plans. Therefore, industrial departments bear a major task in implementing the comprehensive technical transformation of agriculture. Major efforts must be made in the second and third five-year plans to prepare the necessary material conditions for the technical transformation of agriculture. This requires the construction of many modern large enterprises that produce tractors, agricultural machinery, chemical fertilizers, and electricity. It generally takes five to ten years for these enterprises from design, construction to production and full production capacity. Therefore, in order to realize Comrade Mao Zedong's task of completing the technical transformation of agriculture in our country in twenty to twenty-five years, in addition to carrying out a lot of work in cooperation, all necessary preparations must be started immediately in industry.
    The technical transformation of agriculture can only proceed gradually under the specific conditions of our country. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the socialist transformation of agriculture should take a gradual approach, and cooperation should generally take three steps. Therefore, the technical transformation of agriculture should also generally adapt to the development steps of cooperation, gradually developing from new farm implements and various preliminary reforms in agricultural technology to comprehensive agricultural mechanization, electrification, and chemicalization.
    Combining the process of agricultural cooperation, researching and providing appropriate new farm implements according to the different natural conditions, farming methods, and power resources in various places, that is, stipulating the direction and level of agricultural technology development, and helping farmers to carry out technical transformation, this is the most important responsibility of industrial departments in the technical transformation of agriculture. The issue of agricultural cooperation not only raises many new issues for rural work departments, but also raises many new issues for all economic departments. However, we have not raised this issue to the proper principled height, nor have we considered and arranged it as an indispensable link in realizing the general line. We also lack sufficient understanding of the arduousness of implementing agricultural technical transformation. Therefore, not only do we lack systematic research on current issues and take necessary measures, but more importantly, we rarely consider and study the direction of agricultural technology development, that is, technical policies.
    Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that the implementation of agricultural cooperation "should have a comprehensive plan and strengthen leadership", "be proactive, not passive". The technical transformation of agriculture must also be carried out in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, with comprehensive planning, strengthened leadership, and striving for initiative. All industrial departments should immediately begin to systematically study the long-term plan for the technical transformation of agriculture. Study the development level, speed, various different regions, different crops, different farming methods, different means of production required, as well as technical policies and other issues for agricultural means of production. In particular, it is necessary to immediately consider the performance and models of tractors, agricultural machinery, agricultural trucks, chemical fertilizers, and electrical appliances needed in our country based on the specific conditions of our country, and immediately start planning.
    At present, in the initial stage of agricultural cooperation, in order to adapt to agricultural cooperation and supply corresponding means of production, industrial departments should also solve the following problems:
    First, we must also, in view of the current level and development trend of agricultural cooperation, and based on the specific conditions of our country, study which new farm implements, power machinery, chemical fertilizers, etc. should be manufactured and promoted at present, and vigorously organize production and promotion.
    Second, the various means of production provided by industrial departments to agricultural departments must be cheap and of good quality. At present, the prices of farm implements are relatively high. The main reasons are: when designing products, emphasis is placed on durability, more materials are used, and good materials are used, which is not only costly but also too heavy. For example, the plowshare currently uses high-quality steel, which costs 1.1 yuan per kilogram. If ductile iron is used instead, it costs only 0.34 yuan per kilogram. In addition, management costs are high, and some products have high profits. Obviously, these factors that affect costs and selling prices can and must be improved.
    Third, because the current cultural level of our country's farmers is still low, they will encounter some difficulties in adopting new technologies. We must organize the teaching of new technologies, otherwise the new technologies cannot be promoted, or the efficiency will not be improved even if they are adopted. This is also one of the main reasons why there are still many "hanging plows" at present. There is such an example: a farmer in Tongxian County was plowing in the field with a seven-inch walking plow. The plow was not easy to use, so he cursed while plowing. A comrade from the agricultural machinery factory passed by and helped him adjust the rear wheel, and it became easy to use. The farmer said happily: "It turns out that it's not that the plow is bad, but that I don't know how to use it." This shows that if technology is not taught to farmers in time, new technologies will be difficult to adopt. In addition, organizing the repair of farm implements is also an important task. Rural blacksmiths are not competent; there are many people who repair bicycles for farmers to repair farm implements, but the price is very expensive: "Touching it costs more than 3 yuan, and hammering it costs 4.5 yuan." In order to facilitate the organization of agricultural machinery repair work, industrial departments should strengthen the standardization of farm implements and fully supply various accessories and repair tools.
    Fourth, the First Ministry of Machinery Industry has proposed the establishment of an Agricultural Machinery Bureau in accordance with the spirit of Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation". The establishment of this organization is timely and necessary. It should not only organize the production of a large number of new farm implements at present to play an important role in promoting agricultural cooperation, but also closely cooperate with agricultural departments to study and solve the development direction of agricultural technology and improve the level of production. At the same time, we can also consider combining the socialist transformation of private electromechanical industries, and adopting a "one-line" approach for the main joint state-private and private electromechanical industries, that is, carrying out overall planning from both social transformation and technical transformation at the same time. The Chemical Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry should take the same approach to conduct overall planning.
    Developing agricultural production cooperatives on a large scale, and gradually adopting and promoting modern agricultural technologies on the basis of agricultural production cooperatives, raising our country's agricultural production to a new height, and gradually improving the material and cultural lives of farmers, this is the necessary prerequisite for the development of our country's industry; similarly, developing our country's industry, producing tractors, agricultural machinery, agricultural trucks, chemical fertilizers, and electricity, and supplying farmers with a large number of industrial products, this is the necessary prerequisite for the development of our country's agriculture. It can be seen that socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture are closely related, and both tasks are very arduous. We must not only complete socialist industrialization, but also complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. That is to say, the mutually adaptive development of socialist industrialization and agricultural cooperation is the new material basis of the worker-peasant alliance in the current stage of the revolution. In the entire process of agricultural cooperation, the tasks of industrial departments are very heavy. To complete these arduous tasks, we must start from the conditions of our country's human resources and natural resources, adapt to the requirements of agricultural development, and formulate an overall plan on the mechanization, electrification, and chemicalization of agriculture. Industrial workers must fully understand the important responsibility they bear in the socialist transformation of agriculture. Any view that regards agricultural technical transformation and agricultural cooperation as only a "partial task" or only a matter for "rural work departments" is wrong and must be prevented and corrected.
    The task is very arduous. But we believe that with Comrade Mao Zedong's historically significant document "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the CPC, we will surely be able to unify the thinking and understanding of the whole party, and will surely become an indestructible force, and will surely achieve the complete victory of socialist industrialization and agricultural socialist transformation.

    农业合作化和农业技术改造应当密切地结合起来
    薄一波
    在党中央的正确领导下，我们国家的农业的社会主义改造运动正在迅速地健康地向前发展。这个运动的主要的方面，是农业合作化，即农业的社会主义改造；它还有另外的一个重要的方面，就是农业机械化、电气化、化学化，即农业的技术改造。社会主义的基本经济法则是：用在高度技术基础上使社会主义生产不断增长和不断完善的办法，来保证最大限度地满足整个社会经常增长的物质和文化的需要。我们从这里可以了解高度的技术基础对于建设社会主义经济的重要意义。在我国的具体条件下，完成农业的技术改造要比完成农业的社会主义改造需用更多的时间。但是，决不可因此放松对于农业的技术改造的积极努力。农业的技术改造应当适应农业的社会主义改造的需要，并且推动农业的社会主义改造迅速前进。
    这里，我想首先提一下国家的社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造的内在联系的问题。社会主义工业化必须得到农业的有力支持。工业是包括农业在内的整个国民经济的主体，但是它要充分而全面地发展，就必须使农业有与之相适应的提高。因为农业首先就是吸收工业产品的主要市场，是工业原料和商品粮食的供应者，同时又是为了发展我国工业从国外换取机器的出口物资的可靠后备力量。其中特别是商品粮食问题更值得引起我们的注意。苏联一九二八年所曾发生过的粮食困难问题，就是农业的发展和工业的发展不相适应所造成的。当时工业已恢复到战前一九一三年的水平，但农业却仍然低于战前，粮食生产量还只及战前百分之九十一，特别是粮食的商品率只有百分之十三。从一九二五年到一九二八年，社会主义大工业的生产量每年平均增长百分之二十七；但农业的生产量每年平均只增长百分之二点六。当时农业所能供给的商品粮食，只等于战前的百分之三十七，这就说明了：仅仅依靠个体经济的贫农和中农是不能解决日益增长的商品粮食的需要的。正因为这样，苏联当时就订出了加速农业集体化的方针，使之与工业的发展相适应。决不可能设想，我们的以工人阶级为首的人民民主专政的国家可以长期地建筑在社会主义大工业和小农经济的这种跛脚子的基础之上。一亿一千万农户是我国合作化所由以出发的基地。必须慎重将事。对农民只能采取教育说服的方法，而不能强迫命令，这是在任何情况下对农民的坚定不移的态度；但又必须有计划地、有步骤地加以改造。而不能停滞不前。正如斯大林所说：“我们既不需要个体农民经济的诅咒者，也不需要它的歌颂者。”要就是我们解决了这个历史任务，那末，我国社会主义的最后胜利就有了保证；要就是解决不了这个历史任务，那末，就让资本主义占领农村阵地，最后在全国复辟。由此可见，农业合作化和社会主义工业化有着密切的内在的关联，孤立起来的看法是不对的。下面我就谈到农业合作化和农业技术改造应当密切地结合起来的问题。
    毛泽东同志指出：“我们现在不但正在进行关于社会制度方面的由私有制到公有制的革命，而且正在进行技术方面的由手工业生产到大规模现代化机器生产的革命，而这两种革命是结合在一起的。”农业的社会主义改造，在我国的具体条件下，首先是要实行合作化。合作化的集体劳动将使农业生产力得到很大的提高，将使农民逐步养成社会主义集体劳动的习惯。但要根本改变农业生产的落后状况，并把合作化了的农民改变为完全的和彻底的社会主义的劳动者，还必须在技术方面实行改造，即逐步采用拖拉机、农业机器、载重汽车、化学肥料和电气化等现代技术。只有在农业合作化的基础上充分采用现代技术，并且日新月异地改进，不断地把旧技术更换为新技术，把新技术更换为更新的技术，在新技术的基础上不断提高单位面积产量，并大规模地开垦荒地，只有这样，才有可能大大地不断地提高农业的生产力。也只有在农业生产有了高度的发展之后，才能更加显示和充分发挥合作化的优越性。农业合作化之后，农业生产关系已改变为半社会主义的或社会主义的性质了，这将使农民养成社会主义集体劳动的习惯；但如果在技术上仍然停留在手工劳动的水平，就还很困难甚至不可能完全地和彻底地改变小生产者的因循守旧和个人主义的习惯。因此，农业的全面技术改造，也是对农民进行进一步社会主义改造所必须的物质基础。由此可见，在合作化的基础上实行技术改造是完全必要的，但强调技术改造的必要性，决不是也决不可以低估或稍许低估合作化的重大意义，恰恰相反，在我国条件下，如果没有合作化就根本不可能实行农业的技术改造。因为现代化的农业技术，是建立在大生产基础上的，不首先实行合作化扩大农业的生产规模，要采用拖拉机等现代化的农业技术是不可能的。因此，农业合作化和农业的技术改造必须紧密地结合起来。
    有些人很担心农业技术改造必将节省出很多的劳动力来，而我国的人口原来就不少，这些节省出来的和自然增长的劳动力出路何在呢？我认为提出这个问题来并且加以考虑是必要的，但是为劳动力增多而担忧则是没有根据的。我们要对整个国民经济包括农业在内实行技术改造，就是为了把我国从落后的农业国变为先进的工业国，就是为了提高我国的劳动生产率。实行技术改造必将节省出更多的劳动力出来，这是肯定的。根据苏联一九三七年统计数字推断，农业全面实行技术改造即全面采用拖拉机、农业机器、载重汽车、化学肥料和实行电气化以后，它的劳动生产率较之手工的个体的劳动生产率将提高二十五倍以上，较之马拉农具也将提高十五倍以上。这正是我们所要求的。只有这样，才能更进一步地开发我国丰富的资源，才能更进一步地提高我国工农业的生产力，正如毛泽东同志所说的：“中国只有在社会经济制度方面澈底地完成社会主义改造，又在技术方面，在一切能够使用机器操作的部门和地方，通通使用机器操作，才能使社会经济面貌全部改观。”农业实行技术改造以后，节省出的劳动力的出路是多方面的：第一，由于工业大规模的发展，将不断吸收大批劳动力，包括直接参加工业建设的劳动力和为工业服务的各方面所需要的劳动力；第二，农业上大规模开垦荒地，建设农业的新基地，增加技术作物，以及发展农业的多种经济，都需要不断地增加大批劳动力；第三，与工农业建设相适应地发展交通运输业，邮电业以及商业部门也将需要不断地增加很多劳动力；第四，跟着，科学文化教育事业也将大大地发展，也需要不断地增加大批的劳动力。此外，在整个工业化和农业合作化的过程中，我们将要开辟和发展许多工业和农业的新的部门和新的职业，如合作社的经营管理、农具修理等等，这些都需要不断地吸收许多劳动力。再重复一句，大量开垦荒地，建立新的农业基地，将是我国大量剩余劳动力的主要出路。因此，在农业技术改造中，即便出现农业劳动力过剩的某些现象，也只能是一种短期的、暂时的现象，不能成为根本问题。
    但是，实行农业的全面的技术改造，决不是一件很简单的事。毛泽东同志指出：“由于我国的经济条件，技术改革的时间，比较社会改革的时间，会要长一些。估计在全国范围内基本上完成农业方面的技术改革，大概需要四个至五个五年计划，即二十年至二十五年的时间。”这一估计是完全正确的。苏联农业基本上完成技术改造，也花费了大约三个五年计划的时间。我国经济落后，特别是工业还很落后，而我国又是一个人口众多，幅员广大的国家，要把农业从现在这种落后的水平，提高到现代化的水平，是需要一个相当长时间的努力的。在二十年至二十五年的时间内完成农业的全面技术改造，对我们来说，时间是相当紧迫的。
    让我们来举几个数字加以考察吧。
    我国在第一个五年计划结束时，全国土地的播种面积将达二十二亿七千多万亩，同苏联一九五二年的二十三亿四千万亩比较，相差不是很多的；而我国在第一个五年计划完成时，农业技术所能达到的水平，则同苏联现在的水平相差很远。根据不完全的资料统计：苏联一九五四年初拥有拖拉机一百三十万标准台（按十五匹牵引马力折合），年产十八万三千标准台。一九五三年国营农场、集体农庄和拖拉机站拥有载重汽车三十七万辆。一九五五年化学肥料的生产计划为九百四十万吨，一九六四年计划要达到二千八百万至三千万吨。一九五三年农村发电站总能力为一百五十万瓩，全苏联有五分之一以上的集体农庄、百分之九十的国营农场和百分之九十五的拖拉机站已经电气化了。
    我国的情况则十分落后。第一个五年计划期内才开始建设我们自己的拖拉机厂和汽车厂，并且在五年计划末期开始生产少量的拖拉机和少量的载重汽车。化学肥料的生产，一九五七年只有五十九万吨。至于农业电气化，则相差更远，目前只有少数国营农场和合作社使用了小量的电力。
    这就可以看出，在四个至五个五年计划期间把我国农业技术水平提高到苏联现在的水平，将是一个十分艰巨的工作。因此，要实行农业的全面技术改造，工业部门担负着重大的任务。必须在第二个和第三个五年计划中作重大的努力，为农业的技术改造准备必要的物质条件。这就需要建设许多生产拖拉机、农业机器、化学肥料以及电力的现代化的大企业。这些企业从设计、建厂到投入生产以至充分发挥生产能力，一般需要五年以至十年的时间。因此要实现毛泽东同志所提出的在二十年至二十五年的时间内完成我国农业的技术改造的任务，除了在合作化方面进行许多工作外，在工业上必须立即开始作一切必要的准备。
    农业的技术改造在我国的具体条件下只能是逐步前进的。毛泽东同志指出，农业的社会主义改造要采取逐步前进的办法，合作化大体上要分三步走。因此，农业技术改造也应当大体上和合作化的发展步骤相适应，从新式农具和农业技术上的各种初步改革，逐步发展到农业全面机械化、电气化和化学化。
    结合农业合作化的过程，根据各地不同的自然条件、耕作方法和动力资源，研究和提供适当的新式农具，即规定农业技术发展的方向和水平，帮助农民进行技术改造，这是工业部门在农业技术改造中间的最重要的责任。农业合作化问题不仅给农村工作部门提出许多新问题，而且也给一切经济部门提出了许多新问题。但是，我们还没有把这一问题提到应有的原则高度，还没有把它作为实现总路线不可缺少的环节来加以考虑和安排，对于实行农业技术改造的艰巨性也认识不足，因而不仅对于当前的问题缺乏系统的研究，并采取必要的措施，而更主要的是对于农业技术发展的方向即技术政策很少考虑和研究。
    毛泽东同志指示我们，实行农业合作化“要有全面的规划，还要加强领导”，“要主动，不要被动”。农业的技术改造同样也必须根据毛泽东同志的指示，进行全面规划，加强领导，争取主动。各工业部门应立即开始系统地研究农业技术改造的远景方案。研究农业用生产资料的发展水平、速度、各种不同地区不同的作物不同的耕作方法所需要的不同的生产资料，以及技术政策等问题。特别是要立即根据我国的具体情况考虑我国所需要的拖拉机、农业机器、农业用载重汽车、化学肥料和电器等的性能和型号，并立即着手筹划。
    在目前，农业合作化的初期，为了适应农业合作化而供给相应的生产资料，工业部门还应解决以下几个问题：
    第一、还要针对目前农业合作化的水平和发展趋势，根据我国的具体条件，研究在目前应当制造和推广那些新式农具、动力机械、化学肥料等，并大力组织生产和推广。
    第二、工业部门向农业部门提供的各种生产资料必须价廉物美。目前农具的价格是偏高的，其主要原因是：设计产品时，偏重于坚固耐用，多用料，用好料，不但成本高而且太笨重。如犁铧，现用优质钢，每公斤一元一角，改用球墨铸铁，每公斤只三角四分。此外，管理费用大，有的产品利润也高了。很明显，这些影响成本和售价的因素都是可以而且必须改善的。
    第三、由于我国农民现在的文化水平还低，在采用新技术上是会遇到些困难的，必须组织新技术的传授工作，不然新的技术就不能推广，或者采用了效率也不会提高。这也是目前仍然有不少“挂犁”的主要原因之一。有这样一个例子：通县一个农民，使用七寸步犁在田里耕地，犁不好用，边耕边骂，农业机器厂的一位同志从旁经过，就帮助他把后轮调整了一下，好用了。农民高兴地说：“原来不是犁不好，而是不会使。”这说明不及时地把技术传授给农民，新的技术就难于采用。此外，组织对农具的修理也是一件重要工作。农村的铁匠不胜任了；有不少修理自行车的人为农民修理农具，可是价钱很贵“摸一摸三块多，杵一杵四块五。”为了便于组织农业机械的修理工作，工业部门应加强农具的标准化工作，并充分供应各种配件和修理工具。
    第四、第一机械工业部已根据毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的精神，拟议成立农业机械局。这一组织机构的建立是适时的必要的。它不仅应该在目前组织大量新式农具的生产，为推进农业合作化发挥重要的作用；而且应该与农业部门密切配合，研究解决农业技术的发展方向和提高生产水平的问题。同时还可以考虑结合对私营机电工业的社会主义改造，对主要的公私合营和私营的机电工业采取“一条鞭”的办法，即，从社会改造和技术改造两方面同时进行通盘规划。重工业部的化工局应该采取同样的办法进行通盘规划。
    大规模地发展农业生产合作社，并且在农业生产合作社的基础上逐步地采用和推广现代化的农业技术，把我国农业生产提到新的高度，并逐步地改善农民的物质的和文化的生活，这乃是我国工业所赖以发展的必要前提；同样，发展我国工业，生产拖拉机、农业机器、农业用载重汽车、化学肥料和电力等，并且以大量的工业品供给农民，这又是我国农业所赖以发展的必要前提。由此可见，社会主义工业化和农业的社会主义改造是有着密切联系的，这两方面的任务都是十分艰巨的。我们不仅要完成社会主义工业化，同时也要完成农业的社会主义改造。这也就是说，社会主义工业化和农业合作化的互相适应的发展是现阶段革命中工农联盟的新的物质基础。在整个农业合作化的过程中，工业部门的任务是很繁重的。要完成这些艰巨的任务，就必须从我国人力资源、自然资源等条件出发，和农业发展的要求相适应，在农业的机械化、电气化和化学化这几个问题上，制定出通盘计划。工业工作人员要充分认识自己在农业的社会主义改造中所担负的重大责任，任何把农业技术改造，把农业合作化看成只是一个“局部工作”、只是“农村工作部门”的事情的观点，都是错误的，必须防止和纠正。
    任务是十分艰巨的。但我们相信：有了毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”这个有历史意义的文件和中共六中全会通过的“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，就一定能够统一全党的思想和认识，就一定能够成为无坚不摧的力量，必将取得社会主义工业化和农业社会主义改造的彻底胜利。
