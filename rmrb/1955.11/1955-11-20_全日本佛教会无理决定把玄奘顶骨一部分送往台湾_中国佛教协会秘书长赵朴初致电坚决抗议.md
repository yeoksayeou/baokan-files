　　Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: According to Kyodo News, the All Japan Buddhist Association, at its board meeting on November 10th, decided to send a portion of the skull of the eminent Chinese Buddhist philosopher Xuanzang, currently located in Japan, to Taiwan on November 25th.

　　Some time ago, there were reports that some people in Japan were preparing to send the skull of Master Xuanzang, obtained from China, to Taiwan. To this end, on November 5th, Zhao Puchu, Secretary-General of the Buddhist Association of China, sent a telegram to Japanese Buddhist figures opposing this attempt to undermine the friendly relations between Chinese and Japanese Buddhists. It is reported that after receiving this telegram, well-known figures in Japanese Buddhist circles also opposed sending Master Xuanzang's skull to Taiwan. However, a small number of individuals within Japanese Buddhist circles with ulterior motives, instigated by powerful groups, disregarding the solemn expressions of Chinese Buddhist circles and the broad wishes of Japanese Buddhist figures, still intend to send a portion of Master Xuanzang's skull, currently located in Japan, to Taiwan.

　　Xinhua News Agency, November 19th: The following is the telegram sent by Zhao Puchu, Secretary-General of the Buddhist Association of China, to Otani Kocho and Otani Eijun of Higashi Honganji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, and to Mr. Nakayama Riri, on November 19th. Full text as follows: To Venerable Otani Kocho of Higashi Honganji Temple in Kyoto, Japan, Venerable Otani Eijun, and forwarded to Mr. Nakayama Riri:

　　Your telegram is respectfully acknowledged. We are deeply grateful that Venerable Otani Kocho has agreed to do his best to prevent the transportation of Master Xuanzang's skull from Japan to Taiwan. Under what circumstances part of Master Xuanzang's skull was initially transported to Japan is a thing of the past. If our colleagues in Japanese Buddhist circles are willing to keep Master Xuanzang's skull in Japan for continued protection and veneration, we have no objection based on the long-standing relationship between Chinese and Japanese Buddhism. However, we find it difficult to tolerate and strongly protest Mr. Nakayama Riri's proposal to send a portion of Master Xuanzang's skull to Taiwan. We firmly believe that all of you, who are enthusiastic about promoting friendship between Chinese and Japanese Buddhists, will be able to prevent this action, which is bound to affect the friendly relations between Chinese and Japanese Buddhists. This telegram conveys our intention, and we await your reply.

　　全日本佛教会无理决定把玄奘顶骨一部分送往台湾
　　中国佛教协会秘书长赵朴初致电坚决抗议
    新华社十九日讯　据共同社报道，全日本佛教会在十一月十日举行的理事会会议上，决定要在十一月二十五日把存在日本的中国佛教先哲玄奘法师的顶骨的一部分送往台湾。
    若干时候以前，就有消息说，日本有人准备把得自中国的玄奘法师的顶骨送往台湾。为此，十一月五日，中国佛教协会秘书长赵朴初曾致电日本佛教界人士反对这种企图破坏中日两国佛教徒友好关系的行动。据息，在收到这个电报以后，日本佛教界知名之士也反对把玄奘法师的顶骨送往台湾。但是，日本佛教界的少数别有用心的分子却在有势力集团的唆使下，不惜违反中国佛教界人士的严正表示和日本佛教界人士的广泛愿望，仍要把现在日本的玄奘法师的顶骨的一部分送往台湾。
    新华社十九日讯　中国佛教协会秘书长赵朴初十一月十九日给日本京都东本愿寺大谷光畅、大谷莹润以及中山理理等人的电报。全文如下：日本京都东本愿寺大谷光畅法师，大谷莹润法师，并转中山理理先生：
    来电敬悉。承大谷光畅法师答允尽力制止将现在日本的玄奘法师顶骨运往台湾，至为感佩。玄奘法师的一部分顶骨当初系在何种情况下运至日本，已属过去之事。如日本佛教界同仁愿将玄奘法师顶骨继续留在日本护持供奉，则根据中日两国佛教的悠久渊源，我们可无异议。但对中山理理先生所称拟将玄奘法师顶骨送一部分给台湾，我们断难容忍，并且坚决抗议。我们深信，热心促进中日两国佛教徒友谊的诸位法师定能制止此种势必影响中日佛教徒友好关系的行动。特电布意，并候复音。
                中国佛教协会秘书长赵朴初
                    一九五五年十一月十九日
