    Shandong Province Doubles Irrigated Land This Year
    Shandong Province has built many small-scale water conservancy projects this year, expanding irrigated land by more than 4 million mu. Currently, the province utilizes small-scale water conservancy to irrigate more than 8.13 million mu of land. These small-scale farmland water conservancy projects have played a significant role in promoting agricultural production. Farmers in Xinmiao and Chiban townships, and Loude town, in Cuyang County, built a Nanquan gravity irrigation canal this spring, irrigating 4,200 mu of land, and increased grain production by more than 500,000 jin in autumn alone. In Junan County, more than 1,800 agricultural cooperatives have built many small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, which ensured the growth of irrigated crops during the drought in the spring and summer this year. It is estimated that the more than 4 million mu of irrigated land expanded this year throughout the province will increase grain production by more than 400 million jin.

    山东省水浇地今年扩大一倍
    山东省今年又兴修了很多小型水利工程，共扩大四百多万亩水浇地，目前全省利用小型水利浇的地已达八百一十三万多亩。这些小型农田水利工程，对促进农业增产起了很大作用。徂阳县新苗、赤板两个乡和楼德镇的农民，今春修的一处南泉自流灌溉渠，浇地四千二百亩，仅秋季就增产粮食五十多万斤。莒南县有一千八百多个农业合作社，因为兴修了许多小型农田水利，在今年春夏两季呈现旱象时，保证了水浇地农作物的成长。全省今年扩大的四百多万亩水浇地，估计共可增产粮食四亿多斤。　（本报驻济南记者）
