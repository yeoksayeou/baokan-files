Promote Ways to Conserve Metal
　　Should Accept Advanced Experience of Using Refined Copper Instead of Electrolytic Copper
　　To the Editor:
　　The iron and steel industry system consumes a lot of electrolytic copper every year, of which more than 80 percent is used in blast furnace castings (blast furnace tuyeres, slag notches, water tanks, etc.). Electrolytic copper has fast heat dissipation, high temperature resistance, and is impermeable to water. It is a precious metal; saving electrolytic copper is of great significance to our country's socialist construction. Therefore, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant began to trial use refined copper to replace electrolytic copper in manufacturing blast furnace castings in August 1953, and the results have been very good for more than two years. Using refined copper instead of electrolytic copper to make blast furnace castings not only meets the standards completely in terms of quality, but also improves durability and reduces costs. For example, from January to July this year, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant replaced tuyeres an average of 18 times and slag notches 16 times per blast furnace, while the Anshan Iron and Steel Company replaced tuyeres an average of 103 times and slag notches 35 times per blast furnace during the same period. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, due to the use of refined copper instead of electrolytic copper, reduced the cost of blast furnace castings by about 7 percent. Since then, the Longyan, Yangquan, Daye, and other iron and steel plants have also adopted this method.
　　At the beginning of this year, the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry convened a meeting of its affiliated iron and steel plants when reviewing and compiling the technical supply plan, to promote this method, preparing to change the electrolytic copper applied for by various units for blast furnace castings this year to the supply of refined copper. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and other units also introduced their experience in using refined copper at the meeting. However, some personnel from the iron and steel plants refused to accept this experience. For example, the staff member of the Southwest Iron and Steel Company attending the meeting said without reason: "Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant can use it, but we can't." The staff member of the Benxi Iron and Steel Company said that "it can't be changed now." The staff member of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant used "report back to the factory director and then decide" as an excuse. Until now, these units still adopt a negative attitude towards this important task.
　　I believe that in order to save precious metals, the Southwest Iron and Steel Company and other units should quickly correct this conservative thinking towards advanced experience.

　　Using Steel Shavings to Melt High-Grade Cast Iron Parts
　　To the Editor:
　　Waste steel is one of the indispensable raw materials for the machinery industry, especially for cast iron parts. However, our country currently lacks waste steel, which cannot meet the needs of production. The personnel of the supply section of the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant used to be worried about this problem.
　　In February this year, the comrades of the foundry workshop of the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant studied the Soviet Union's technical theory and operating experience in the recycling and utilization of steel shavings, and experimented with using steel shavings to melt high-grade cast iron parts. With the strong support of the leading staff, after four trials at the end of February, they finally successfully used 12 percent steel shavings to replace 20 percent waste steel to melt cast iron parts, and could reach the first-grade cast iron standard without outside-of-furnace inoculation treatment. Using this kind of mix to melt the main parts, such as the bed surface and gearbox, also completely meets the technical requirements. After adopting this method, the plant can save more than 70 tons of waste steel for the country every year.
　　The First Ministry of Machine Building has already issued a notice requiring all affiliated factories to promote this experience. The Beijing First Machine Tool Plant and the Hangzhou Universal Machinery Plant have already sent people to the Nanjing Machine Tool Plant to study.

### 推广节约金属的办法

　　推广节约金属的办法
　　应该接受用精铜代替电铜的先进经验编辑同志：
    钢铁工业系统中每年都需要消耗很多电铜，其中百分之八十以上用在高炉铸件上（高炉的风口、渣口、水箱等）。电铜散热快、耐高温、不渗水，是一种贵重金属；节约电铜对于我国社会主义建设事业有着重大意义。因此，石景山钢铁厂从一九五三年八月开始试用精铜代替电铜制造高炉铸件，两年多以来效果很好。用精铜代替电铜制高炉铸件，不但质量完全合乎标准，并且还提高了耐用程度，降低了成本。例如今年一到七月间，石景山钢铁厂平均每座高炉更换风口十八次、渣口十六次，而鞍山钢铁公司在同期间内平均每座高炉更换风口一百零三次，渣口三十五次；石景山钢铁厂由于用精铜代替电铜，使高炉铸件成本降低了百分之七左右。在这以后，龙烟、阳泉、大冶等钢铁厂也采用这个办法。
    今年年初，重工业部钢铁工业管理局在审编技术供应计划的时候，曾召集所属各钢铁厂开会来推广这个办法，准备把今年各单位申请供应的制高炉铸件的电铜改为供应精铜；石景山钢铁厂等单位在会上还介绍了使用精铜的经验。但是，有些钢铁厂的经办人员却拒绝接受这个经验。例如，西南钢铁公司参加会议的工作人员毫无理由地说：“石景山钢铁厂可以用，但是我们不行。”本溪钢铁公司的工作人员说是“现在改不了”。太原钢铁厂的工作人员则用“回去向厂长汇报以后再说”来搪塞。直到现在，这些单位对这项重要工作还是采取消极的态度。
    我认为：为了节约贵重金属，西南钢铁公司等单位应该迅速纠正这种对待先进经验的保守思想。

　  利用钢切屑回炉熔制高级铸铁件编辑同志：
    废钢是机械工业不可缺少的原材料之一，特别是铸铁件更离开不了废钢。但是我国目前废钢缺乏，不能满足生产的需要。南京机床厂供应科的人员过去就经常为这个问题发愁。
    今年二月，南京机床厂铸工车间的同志们学习了苏联在钢切屑回收利用方面的技术理论和操作经验，试验利用钢切屑回炉熔制高级铸铁件。在领导工作人员的大力支持下，二月底经过四次试验，终于成功地使用百分之十二的钢切屑代替百分之二十的废钢熔制铸铁件，不经过炉外孕育处理就可以达到一级铸铁标准；用这种配料来熔制主要件床面、齿轮箱等，也完全合乎技术要求。这个厂采用了这项办法后，每年可以为国家节省废钢七十多吨。
    第一机械工业部已经发出通知，要所属各厂推广这一经验。北京第一机床厂和杭州通用机器厂等已经派人到南京机床厂学习。
