Harbin's new sleeper anti-corrosion factory in Sankeshu, after thirteen months of construction, began trial production in mid-October. The first batch of anti-corrosion sleepers produced are of good quality. This factory was designed according to the design standards of the Soviet sleeper anti-corrosion factory, and most of the operations are done with electricity and machines. For example, the entire process of loading, unloading, and transporting sleepers is done by machines.

Sleepers used for paving roads, poles for erecting electric wires, and timber used for building bridges can have their service life extended by two to three times after being steamed and anti-corroded. After only three months of production, the value of timber saved by this factory will be enough to build another similar sleeper anti-corrosion factory.

After the factory goes into production, it will produce two million anti-corrosion sleepers for the country every year. It can lay more than 1,250 kilometers of railway. The products produced by this factory will supply the timber needed for major repairs by the Harbin, Qiqihar, Jilin, Jinzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, and Jinan railway administrations.

    哈尔滨枕木防腐工厂开始试生产产品质量良好
    哈尔滨三棵树新建的枕木防腐工厂，经过十三个月的施工，已于十月中旬开始试生产，第一批生产的防腐枕木，质量良好。这座工厂是我国学习苏联枕木防腐工厂的设计标准而设计的，绝大部分是用电气和机器操作。例如整个装卸、运输枕木的过程，都是用机器。
    凡是铺道用的枕木，架设电线的杆子，以及造桥梁用的木材，经过蒸制防腐后可以延长使用年限二倍到三倍。这个工厂只要经过三个月的生产，节约木材的价值，就足够用来再兴建一座同样的枕木防腐工厂。
    这座工厂投入生产后，每年将为国家生产二百万根防腐枕木。可铺设一千二百五十多公里铁路。这个工厂所生产的产品，将供应哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、吉林、锦州、北京、天津、济南等七个铁路管理局大修理需要的木材。（本报驻哈尔滨记者）
