Shaanxi Province's supply and marketing cooperatives plan to promote more than 20,000 various new agricultural tools this year, and more than 90 percent have already been delivered to farmers. Among them, large-scale new agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows, double-wheeled single-shared plows, twelve-row seeders, and cotton seeders have all completed their promotion plans. In the promotion of various new agricultural tools, especially the promotion of double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows, because the supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural technology extension stations in various counties generally attached importance to publicity, demonstration, and technical instruction, coupled with the encouragement of farmers' enthusiasm for actively increasing production and taking the road of collectivization by the "three fixings" of grain to households, many counties have completed their promotion plans ahead of schedule or exceeded them. For example, Xixiang County completed its plan to promote 43 double-wheeled double-shared plows by the end of October. Liquan County originally planned to promote 130 double-wheeled double-shared plows, but promoted 180. After completing the promotion plan, many areas requested an increase in the supply of new agricultural tools from the farmers. Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to increase the supply of 9,000 double-wheeled double-shared plows and double-wheeled single-shared plows, which were planned to be promoted next year, to farmers this year. At the same time, more than 160,000 spare parts for repairing double-wheeled double-shared plows and more than 9,000 copies of instructions for using double-wheeled double-shared plows were supplied. In order to ensure the timely allocation of these new agricultural tools, the supply and marketing cooperatives adopted the method of direct transportation to supply the needs of farmers in southern Shaanxi, northern Shaanxi, and Guanzhong areas with inconvenient transportation as soon as possible for winter plowing production.

　  陕西积极推广新式农具
    陕西省供销合作社今年计划推广的两万多部各种新式农具，目前已经有百分之九十以上送到农民手里。其中大型新式农具如双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁，十二行播种机、棉花播种机等，已经全部完成了推广计划。在推广各种新式农具特别是推广双轮双铧犁、双轮单铧犁中，由于各县供销合作社和农业技术推广站都普遍重视了宣传、示范和技术传授工作，加上粮食“三定”到户工作对农民积极增产和走合作化道路热情的鼓舞，所以不少县都提前或超额完成了推广计划。如西乡县在十月底就完成了推广四十三部双轮双铧犁的计划。醴泉县原计划推广一百三十部双轮双铧犁，结果推广了一百八十部。不少地区在完成推广计划以后，农民要求增加供应新式农具。最近陕西省供销合作社已经决定把明年推广的双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁九千部，提到今年供应农民。同时供应双轮双铧犁的修配零件十六万多件和双轮双铧犁的使用说明书九千多份。为了这些新式农具调拨及时，供销合作社对陕南、陕北及关中交通不便的地区，采用直线调运的办法，尽快地供应农民冬耕生产的需要。（王克仁）
