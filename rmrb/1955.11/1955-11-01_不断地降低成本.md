    Continuously Reducing Costs
    Li Deyu
    Director of the Lanzhou Local State-Owned Flour Mill

    Since 1953, our factory has comprehensively overfulfilled the state plan targets every year, and costs have been decreasing year by year. In the first half of this year, the actual cost decreased by 9.66% compared with 1954, and 6.82% compared with the plan. In July this year, the actual unit cost was 4.44% lower than the planned cost, and in August it was 5.98% lower than in July.

    In order to reduce costs, we have paid special attention to the political and ideological leadership of the financial and accounting departments, and criticized the tendency among financial and accounting staff to not proceed from reality and to be divorced from production. On this ideological basis, the financial and accounting staff can more proactively study specific issues related to cost reduction, and have successively established systems such as quota-based material requisition and economic activity analysis. These systems help the accounting department to grasp the economic activities of the entire factory, understand the rise and fall of costs, and thus be able to supervise and inspect the implementation of cost plans by each workshop. In order to universally establish the concept of economic accounting among the masses, we piloted the "Economic Accounting Handbook" in May this year. At the end of each month, the monthly cost plan and actual completion status are filled in the handbook, which is distributed to each workshop team, and the comrades responsible for cost work provide a popular explanation, explaining the increase and decrease of various expenses and their reasons, so that workers have a more systematic cost concept, thereby valuing their labor results and turning cost reduction into a constant goal.

    Promoting advanced experience and maximizing the efficiency of existing equipment is an important factor in reducing the cost of our factory's products. In the second half of 1953, we promoted the advanced experience of the "front-end flour extraction" method, which increased the average output by 53.45%, the equipment utilization rate by 92.92%, and reduced the cost by 39.64%. In the second half of last year, we promoted the advanced experience of "six-stage flour extraction", which shortened the flour milling process, overcame the imbalance of equipment capacity, and greatly improved the flour extraction rate. By July this year, the average output increased by 38.76% compared with July last year, the average flour extraction rate increased by 3.37%, and the management expenses in the cost decreased by 16.4%.

    Appropriately adjusting labor organization and rationally spending wage funds are also effective measures to reduce costs. In July this year, we reduced some odd-job personnel and auxiliary workers, and increased production workers. Some workshops changed from three shifts to three and a half shifts (originally the factory stopped for holidays on Sundays, but after adding shifts, people take turns off every day, and the factory continues to operate on Sundays), which increased the output by 9.2% and reduced the management fee in the cost by 8.28% compared with June.

    In order to reduce costs, we also focused on reducing material consumption. In April and May this year, we cleared the small warehouses in the workshops and found that the total value of materials that should have been returned to the warehouse but were not amounted to 13,800 yuan. When compiling the material plan, some people thought that "as long as the task is completed, it doesn't matter if we use more materials!" Procurement personnel do not consider whether production needs it or not, and buy it on time as long as it is on the plan. As a result, there is a backlog, and some materials become waste and dead stock after being backlogged for a long time. In order to change this situation, on the one hand, we used concrete facts, blackboards, broadcasts, and meetings to publicize to employees and let everyone understand the significance of saving materials; on the other hand, we organized special personnel to conduct clearing and disposal in the workshops, establish inspection and testing systems, and strictly implement material requisition and return systems. After the comprehensive conservation movement was launched, each workshop and department also formulated a production increase and conservation plan. The workers put forward the slogan "Saving is glorious, waste is shameful." In August, the No. 1 flour milling workshop used much less machine oil, rosin, tape, steel wire cloth, sieve silk, and copper tiles than originally planned, some even saving more than half. The consumption of materials and tools in the electromechanical workshop saved 30% compared with the plan. In the past, every time a machine was repaired, a small basket of copper tiles had to be replaced; now the workers put the copper tiles removed from the quick rollers on the slow rollers for use, reducing the consumption of copper tiles.

    The main production tool of the flour mill is the steel mill, and the quality of the steel roller and whether it is supplied in time play a decisive role in increasing output and flour extraction rate. Before 1954, the steel rollers we used were all bought from outside, with many sand holes, soft texture, and high prices; and from ordering to picking up the goods, it often took four or five months, and sometimes production was affected because the steel rollers were not supplied in time. In December last year, we successfully trial-produced new steel rollers, and the cost of all the new steel rollers put into production in the first half of this year was more than half lower than the steel rollers purchased in 1954. Moreover, due to the good quality, the output and flour extraction rate have increased, and the depreciation expense of steel roller equipment in the cost has decreased by 50.51%.

    The above facts tell us that a factory with backward equipment and old machines can continuously improve labor productivity and create wealth for the country as long as it relies on employees to tap potential according to the characteristics of the enterprise.

    Now we still have some problems in cost management. We have not yet grasped the power costs that account for more than one-third of the cost. Since this year, the plan to reduce power consumption has not been completed. This is mainly because our leading staff has not given enough attention. According to inspection, as long as reasonable adjustments are made to the equipment and some specific problems in operation are solved in time, power consumption can be reduced. Now all our employees are working hard to further reduce power consumption.

    不断地降低成本
    地方国营兰州面粉厂厂长　李德玉
    我们工厂从一九五三年起，每年都全面超额完成了国家计划指标，成本逐年降低，今年上半年实际成本又比一九五四年降低百分之九点六六，比计划降低百分之六点八二。今年七月份的实际单位成本比计划降低了百分之四点四四，八月份比七月份又降低百分之五点九八。
    为了降低成本，我们特别重视了对财务会计部门的政治思想领导，批判了财务会计工作人员中不从实际出发、脱离生产的倾向。在这样的思想基础上，财务会计工作人员能够比较主动地研究有关降低成本的具体问题，先后建立了限额领料、经济活动分析等制度。这些制度帮助会计部门掌握了全厂的经济活动，了解到成本的升降情况，从而能够对各车间执行成本计划的情况进行督促和检查。为了在群众中普遍树立经济核算思想，今年五月间我们试行了“经济核算手册”。每月月终，把当月成本计划和实际完成情况填写在手册上，发到各车间小组，并由负责成本工作的同志作通俗解释，说明各项费用升高降低的情况和原因，使工人有较系统的成本概念，从而重视自己的劳动成果，把降低成本变成了经常的奋斗目标。
    推广先进经验，发挥现有设备效能，是我厂产品成本降低的一个重要因素。一九五三年后半年，我们推广了“前路出粉”法的先进经验，平均产量提高了百分之五十三点四五，设备利用率提高了百分之九十二点九二，成本降低了百分之三十九点六四。去年后半年，我们又推广了“六级出粉”的先进经验，缩短了制粉程序，克服了设备能力的不均衡，大大提高了出粉率。到今年七月，平均产量比去年七月提高了百分之三十八点七六，平均出粉率提高了百分之三点三七，成本中的管理费用降低了百分之十六点四。
    适当地调整劳动组织，合理支用工资基金，也是降低成本的有效措施。我们在今年七月间减少了一部分勤杂人员和辅助工人，增加了生产工人。有的车间由三班改为三班半（原来星期日停车休假，增加班次后，每天有人轮流休假，星期日照常开车生产），使产量提高了百分之九点二，使成本中的管理费比六月份降低了百分之八点二八。
    为了降低成本，我们还抓紧降低材料的消耗。今年四、五月间，我们清查了车间的小仓库，查出应退库而未退的材料总值达一万三千八百元。在编制材料计划的时候，有的人认为“只要完成任务，多用些材料没啥！”采购人员不考虑生产需要不需要，只要计划上有就按时买来。结果造成积压，有些材料积压日久变成了废料和呆料。为了改变这种状况，我们一方面通过具体事实，利用黑板报、广播、会议向职工宣传，让大家懂得节约材料的意义；另一方面组织专人在车间进行清查处理，建立检查检验制度和严格推行领料退料制度。全面节约运动开展后，各车间科室又制定了增产节约计划。工人们提出了“节约光荣，浪费可耻”的口号。八月份，制粉一车间用的机油、松香、胶带、钢丝布、筛绢、铜瓦都比原订计划节省了很多，有的甚至节约了一半以上。机电车间材料工具的消耗比计划节约了百分之三十。过去每检修一次机器，要换下一小筐铜瓦；现在工人们把快辊上换下来的铜瓦装在慢辊上使用，减少了铜瓦的消耗量。
    面粉厂的主要生产工具是钢磨，钢磨的主要部分是钢辊，钢辊质量的好坏和供应是否及时，对提高产量和出粉率起着决定作用。一九五四年以前，我们所用的钢辊都是从外面买来的，沙眼多，质地软，价格高；而且从订货到提货，往往要四、五个月，有时因为钢辊供应不及时而影响了生产。去年十二月，我们试制成功了新钢辊，今年上半年投入生产的全部新钢辊成本比一九五四年买进的钢辊低一半以上。而且由于质量好，产量和出粉率都提高了，成本中钢辊设备的折旧费降低了百分之五十点五一。
    以上事实告诉我们：一个设备落后、机器陈旧的工厂，只要根据企业特点，依靠职工发掘潜力，就会不断地提高劳动生产率，为国家创造财富。
    现在我们在成本管理上还有一些问题，还没有抓住在成本中占三分之一以上的动力费用，今年以来，降低电力消耗的计划始终没有完成。这主要是因为我们领导工作人员没有给以足够的重视。根据检查，只要在设备上作合理的调整，及时解决操作中一些具体问题，电耗就可以降低。现在我们全体职工正在为进一步降低电力消耗而努力。
