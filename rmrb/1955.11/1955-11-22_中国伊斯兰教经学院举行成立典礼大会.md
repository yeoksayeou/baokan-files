The China Islamic Theological Institute held its founding ceremony in Beijing on the 21st.

Responsible persons and representatives from the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, the Religious Affairs Bureau of the State Council, the China Islamic Association, the Buddhist Association of China, and the Chinese Hui Muslim Cultural Advancement Association, as well as members of the Second Enlarged Session of the First All-China Committee of the China Islamic Association, Ahongs, and Mullahs, all attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Ma Songting, Vice President of the China Islamic Theological Institute, first recited the opening chapter of the Quran. After the recitation, Nur Muhammad Dapu Sheng Khan Zhi, Vice President of the Institute, led all the Islamic believers present in performing "Du'a" (prayer).

Wang Feng, Deputy Director of the Nationalities Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China, spoke at the meeting. He said that the establishment of the Islamic Theological Institute specifically embodies the policy of freedom of religious belief of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and is a joyous event for people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam. It symbolizes the greater unity of all ethnic groups in China, and is therefore a common joyous event for all ethnic groups in China. Wang Feng encouraged all teachers and students of the Institute to work hard to run the Institute well.

Yusuf Ma Yu Huai, President of the China Islamic Theological Institute, pointed out in his speech that the establishment of the Institute is to cultivate Ahongs who have noble qualities of loving the motherland and loving socialism, and who have sufficient Arabic and Islamic theological and various other knowledge, in order to better serve the people of all ethnic groups who believe in Islam. Yusuf Ma Yu Huai said that predecessors who believed in Islam had the desire to establish such a school, but none of them were realized, and it was only realized today under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

At the meeting, student representatives from the Central Institute for Nationalities and the Beijing Hui Muslim College presented the Institute with pennants and congratulatory messages. Student representatives from the Institute delivered a thank-you speech to the guests who came to congratulate them.

This semester, the China Islamic Theological Institute has a total of 109 students from the Hui, Uygur, Kazakh, and Uzbek ethnic groups from provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. They now all have a certain amount of knowledge of Arabic, Islamic theology, and other cultural knowledge. At the Institute, they will study religious courses (including Arabic, dogma, canon law, Hadith) and cultural courses for four years.

The other two vice presidents of the Institute are Ali Zhang Yuzhen and Zhemalunding Li Shu. (Xinhua News Agency)
