Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, 30th - According to TASS, the spokesman of the Yugoslav Secretariat of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Draskovic, made a statement at a press conference on the 28th regarding the upcoming visit of U.S. Secretary of State Dulles to Yugoslavia.

He announced that Dulles would visit the President of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, Tito, on November 6th. He said that Tito did not intend to discuss certain specific and pressing issues related to the two countries during his talks with Dulles, because some of these issues had already been resolved during Murphy's visit to Yugoslavia not long ago, and others were being resolved through normal diplomatic channels; their talks would exchange views on pressing issues of the world political situation.

In response to a question from a reporter, Draskovic said that Dulles' visit to Yugoslavia was proposed by the U.S. government and was a manifestation of both sides' willingness to strengthen cooperation between the two countries. Draskovic said that we have always advocated personal contact and the exchange of views between senior politicians, which is beneficial to strengthening mutual relations and deepening mutual understanding between countries.

    南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人
    就杜勒斯访南发表声明
    新华社三十日讯　据塔斯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫外交秘书处发言人德拉什科维奇二十八日在记者招待会上就美国国务卿杜勒斯即将访问南斯拉夫发表声明。
    他宣布，杜勒斯将在十一月六日访问南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托。他说，铁托同杜勒斯会谈时并不准备讨论某些同两国有关的具体的迫切问题，因为这些问题有的已经在不久以前墨菲访问南斯拉夫的时候得到解决，有的正在通过正常的外交途径解决中；他们的会谈将就世界政治局势的迫切问题交换意见。
    德拉什科维奇在回答一个记者的问题时说，杜勒斯访问南斯拉夫是美国政府提出的，并且是双方愿意加强两国之间的合作的表现。德拉什科维奇说，我们一直主张个人接触，主张高级政治家之间交换意见，这对加强相互关系和加深国与国之间的相互谅解是有好处的。
