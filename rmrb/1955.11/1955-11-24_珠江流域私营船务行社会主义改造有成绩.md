Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 23rd: By the end of October, 116 private shipping companies in the Pearl River Basin had implemented joint state-private ownership. The total horsepower of the ships of these 116 shipping companies accounted for 51 percent of the original total horsepower of private ships, and their deadweight tonnage and passenger capacity accounted for 46 percent and 62 percent of the original private ship deadweight tonnage and passenger capacity, respectively. After merging and reorganizing, these joint ventures formed seven joint state-private shipping companies, distributed in five ports including Guangzhou and Wuzhou. The three companies located in Guangzhou Port, under the leadership of the Pearl River Navigation Administration Bureau, are preparing to merge and reorganize again into the joint state-private Pearl River Shipping Company.

The Pearl River, including the three major tributaries of the West River, North River, and East River, and many tributaries, flows through Guangxi and Guangdong provinces and is a major artery of water transportation in South China. In the past, most of the ships sailing in the Pearl River were privately owned. Due to poor management and dilapidated ships, they could not meet the needs of the country. Since the second half of last year, the People's Government has gradually carried out socialist transformation of the private shipping industry in the Pearl River system, and the face of Pearl River shipping has begun to change. Now the ships sailing in the Pearl River, including those that have been jointly operated and those that have not, are uniformly dispatched by the Pearl River Navigation Administration Bureau to carry out transportation tasks according to national plans. This summer, the Pearl River Basin faced heavy flood prevention and rescue tasks, and the ships of various joint state-private shipping companies in Guangzhou Port were able to go to support in time under the dispatch of the Pearl River Navigation Administration Bureau. Recently, the volume of freight and passenger transport on routes from Guangzhou to Nanning and other places has increased, and the ships of various joint state-private shipping companies have also actively participated in transportation under unified dispatch. The joint state-private shipping companies have made significant improvements in operation and management. More than 40 of the 51 ships of the Guangzhou Port Joint State-Private Xinhua Shipping Company have been repaired, and the transportation capacity has been enhanced.

　　珠江流域私营船务行社会主义改造有成绩
    新华社广州二十三日电　珠江流域各港口的私营船务行，到十月底已经有一百十六户实行了公私合营。这一百十六户船务行的船舶总马力，占原有私营船舶总马力的百分之五十一，载重量和客位分别占原有私营船舶载重量和客位的百分之四十六和百分之六十二。这些已经合营的船务行经过合并改组后，共组成了七个公私合营轮船公司，分布在广州和梧州等五个港口。设在广州港的三个公司，在珠江航运管理局的领导下，正在筹备再合并改组成为公私合营珠江轮船公司。
    珠江包括西江、北江和东江三大干流和许多支流，流经广西和广东两省，是华南的水上交通大动脉。过去航行在珠江的船舶绝大部分是私营的，由于经营不善，船只破旧，不能适应国家的要求。去年下半年以来，人民政府对珠江水系私营轮船业逐步进行社会主义改造，珠江航运的面貌才开始改观。现在航行在珠江的轮船，包括合营的和未合营的都已经由珠江航运管理局统一调度，按照国家计划执行运输任务。今年夏季，珠江流域防汛抢险任务繁重，广州港各公私合营轮船公司的船只在珠江航运管理局调派下都能及时前往支援。最近，从广州到南宁等航线上的货运量、客运量增加，各公私合营轮船公司的船舶在统一调度下也积极参加了运输。公私合营了的船务行，经营管理等方面都有显著改进。广州港公私合营新华轮船公司的五十一艘船舶，有四十多艘已经经过修理，运输力量有了增强。
