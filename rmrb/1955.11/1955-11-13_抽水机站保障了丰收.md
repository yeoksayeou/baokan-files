　　Editor,
　　“Birds cannot fly without wings, fish cannot swim without water; agriculture will forever lag behind without industry!” This is the conclusion reached by the broad masses of farmers in the Fangqiao electric irrigation area of ​​Anhui Province from their own experiences.
　　The Fangqiao electric irrigation area includes more than 20,000 mu of farmland in three townships in the suburbs of Hefei City and five townships in the Chengnan District of Feixi County. This is a hilly area with fertile land, suitable for growing rice. However, in the past, due to the lack of water sources, there were droughts in almost nine out of ten years, often leading to reduced production or no harvest at all. Since the state established an electric pumping station here, the face of the farmland has changed. In July and August of this year, when mid-season rice was heading and filling, and irrigation was urgently needed, it happened that it had not rained for more than a month. Therefore, the pumping station released water in a timely manner. Six 50-horsepower pumps drew water from the Nanfei River day and night, and after 30 miles of canals, it flowed into the densely distributed ditches and "dragon whisker" ditches, continuously irrigating large areas of farmland. Not only was the threat of drought completely eliminated, but more than 65 percent of the irrigated area became self-flowing irrigation, saving countless labor and tools. In this way, farmers had more strength to engage in work such as accumulating fertilizer and strengthening field management, guaranteeing that grain production in the irrigated area this year increased by more than 3.2 million jin compared to 1953.
　　This vivid fact has greatly inspired the determination of farmers in the irrigation area to take the road of collectivization. They understand that to strive for the early arrival of the happy day of complete agricultural mechanization, they must first organize and change the current scattered and backward management state. Now seven agricultural production cooperatives have been organized in the entire area, with the number of member households accounting for more than 11 percent of the total number of households; and more farmers are actively requesting to join the cooperatives. Vice Chairman Hu of the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative said well: "With the pumping station and the cooperative, increased production has a preliminary guarantee. As long as we continue to work hard, with the development of national industrialization and agricultural collectivization, our lives will be as red as the rising sun in the east!"

### 抽水机站保障了丰收

　　抽水机站保障了丰收编辑同志：
    “鸟无翅不飞，鱼无水不游；农业离开了工业将永远落后！”这句话是安徽省方桥电力灌溉区广大农民从切身经历中得出的结论。
    方桥电力灌溉区包括合肥市郊区三个乡和肥西县城南区五个乡的两万多亩农田。这儿是丘陵地带，土地肥沃，适宜于种水稻。可是，往年由于缺少水源，差不多十年九旱，以致常常减产或颗粒无收。自从国家在这里建立了电力抽水机站以后，农田的面貌就起了变化。今年七、八月间，正是中稻抽穗灌浆，迫切需要灌溉的时候，恰好有一个多月没有下雨了。于是抽水机站及时放水，六部五十马力的抽水机日夜不停地把南淝河的水抽上来，经过三十里的渠道，流入密布如网的陡渠和龙须渠，源源不绝地灌溉着大片农田，不但彻底消除了旱灾的威胁，而且使灌溉区百分之六十五以上的水田变成了自流灌溉，节省了无数的劳动力和工具。这样，农民们就有更多的力量去从事积肥和加强田间管理等工作，保证了灌溉区今年粮食产量比一九五三年增产三百二十多万斤。
    这一生动的事实大大地激发了灌溉区农民走合作化道路的决心。他们懂得，要争取农业全部机械化这个幸福日子的早日到来，首先就必须组织起来，改变目前分散、落后的经营状态。现在全区已经组织了七个农业生产合作社，入社农户占农户总数的百分之十一强；而还有更多的农民正积极地要求参加合作社。团结农业生产合作社的胡副社长说得好：“有了抽水机站和合作社，增产有了初步的保障。只要我们继续加油干，随着国家工业化和农业合作化的发展，我们的日子就会像东方升起的太阳一样，越来越红！”
