Xinhua News Agency, 14th: This year, geological prospecting personnel in our country have found another large batch of mineral resources throughout the country. According to the statistics of the units under the Ministry of Geology alone, there are 47 new mineral sites that have been confirmed and can be transferred to exploration next year, including iron, copper, lead, zinc, oil shale, coal, phosphorus and other mineral sites.

　　Geological prospecting personnel have found many ferrous metal and non-ferrous metal mineral resources this year. Among them, in addition to preliminarily finding iron ore for the establishment of a steel base in the Northwest region, many iron ore deposits have also been found in the Southwest, Central South, and North China regions. The discovery of a rich iron ore deposit in the Central Plains region is of great significance for the development of the steel industry in the Central Plains region. A large iron ore deposit was discovered in Guizhou Province, and a coking coal production site was also discovered near the iron ore. Many copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc and other mineral deposits have also been discovered this year. A large lead-zinc deposit was found in the Northwest region. The ore contains high levels of lead and zinc, and the ore layer is very thick. It is a very promising lead-zinc mineral site.

　　This year, geological prospecting personnel have discovered new oil-bearing structures, oil shale and coal production sites in many regions. In many provinces or autonomous regions such as Qinghai, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Guizhou, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, geological prospecting personnel have discovered more than one hundred oil-bearing structures that may contain oil. The most oil-bearing structures were discovered in the Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province. According to preliminary surveys, the oil-bearing structures in the Qaidam Basin are very concentrated, and some structures are as large as hundreds of square kilometers and have suffered very little natural damage. An oil shale mine discovered in the Northwest region has a high oil content and large reserves, and is one of the largest oil shale mines discovered in our country. Among the coalfields discovered in the Southwest region, one coking coal production site has very large reserves and the coal is of good quality, which can partially meet the coking coal needs for the further development of the steel industry in the Southwest region. A coalfield discovered in Gansu Province is judged to have large coal reserves and good quality based on existing data. The discovery of this coalfield will play a significant role in meeting the needs of industrial development in the Lanzhou area and the Lanzhou-Xinjiang and Baotou-Lanzhou railway transportation.

　　This year, geological prospecting personnel have also found phosphorus, sulfur and other minerals in many regions, creating conditions for the further development of chemical fertilizer production. A phosphate mine found in Sichuan Province has abundant reserves and the ore has a high phosphorus content, which can supply the raw materials needed for the production of a phosphate fertilizer plant. A phosphate mine discovered at the foot of Jinpingshan Mountain in Jiangsu Province has been preliminarily surveyed and proven to be a mining area with a very thick phosphorus-containing rock layer, high phosphorus content in the ore, and large reserves. In addition, geological prospecting personnel have also found many other non-metallic minerals such as borax, mercury, and asbestos this year.

　　今年全国发现大批矿产资源
    新华社十四日讯　我国地质普查人员今年在全国各地又找到了大批矿产资源。仅据地质部所属单位的统计，已肯定可以在明年转入勘探的新的矿产地，就有铁、铜、铅、锌、油母页岩、煤、磷等矿产地四十七处。
    地质普查人员今年找到了很多黑色金属和有色金属的矿产资源。其中除了为西北地区建立钢铁基地初步找到了铁矿以外，在西南、中南、华北等地也找到了多处铁矿。在中原地区找到的一个富铁矿，对在中原地区发展钢铁工业有很大意义。在贵州省发现了一个较大的铁矿，在铁矿附近还发现了炼焦煤产地。今年发现的铜、钼、铅、锌等矿种的产地也很多。在西北地区找到了一个大型的铅锌矿，矿石含的铅锌成分很高，矿层很厚，是一个很有希望的铅锌矿产地。
      今年地质普查人员在许多地区发现了储油构造、油母页岩和煤的新产地。在青海、新疆、四川、贵州、河北、内蒙古等许多省或自治区，地质普查人员已发现了一百多个可能含油的储油构造。在青海省柴达木盆地发现的储油构造最多，据初步勘测，柴达木盆地的储油构造很集中，有些构造的面积大到几百平方公里，遭受的天然破坏也很少。在西北地区发现的一个油母页岩矿，含油率高，储量大，是我国已发现的最大的油母页岩矿之一。在西南地区发现的煤田中，有一个炼焦煤产地的储量很大，煤的质量很好，可以部分满足西南地区进一步发展钢铁工业所需的炼焦用煤。在甘肃省发现的一个煤田，据现有资料判断，煤藏量较大，而且质量良好。这一煤田的发现对满足兰州地区工业发展和兰新、包兰铁路运输的需要将有很大作用。
    今年地质普查人员还在不少地区找到了磷、硫等矿产，为进一步发展化学肥料生产创造了条件。在四川省境内找到的一个磷矿储量很丰富，矿石含磷量很高，可以供应一个磷肥厂生产所需的原料。在江苏省锦屏山麓发现的一个磷矿，据初步勘察证明，也是一个含磷岩层很厚、矿石含磷很高、储量大的矿区。此外，地质普查人员今年还找到了多处硼砂、汞、石棉等其他非金属矿产。
