　　Hunan Province has victoriously overfulfilled its 1955 tobacco leaf procurement plan by 48.83% by the end of October. The tobacco leaf procured by Hunan Province this year, in addition to supplying the cigarette industry in the province and Shanghai as raw materials, will also be largely organized for export. Farmers in tobacco-producing areas of Hunan such as Xinshao and Guiyang enthusiastically sold their tobacco leaves to the state during the tobacco leaf procurement process, with daily market volumes reaching 20,000 jin in September. The total income of tobacco farmers throughout the province from selling tobacco leaves can purchase more than 20,000 head of draught cattle.

　　湖南烟叶收购计划超额完成
    湖南省一九五五年度的烟叶收购计划，到十月底已超额百分之四十八点八三胜利完成。湖南省今年收购的烟叶，除了供应省内和上海等地卷烟工业做原料外，还将大量地组织出口。湖南产烟区新邵、桂阳等地农民，在烟叶收购中，踊跃把烟叶卖给国家，在九月份每天上市量达两万斤。全省烟农出售烟叶的总收入，可以购买两万多头耕牛。
