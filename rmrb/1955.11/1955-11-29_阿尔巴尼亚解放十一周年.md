　　Eleventh Anniversary of Albania's Liberation
　　By Major General Banayo Prago, Deputy Minister of National Defense of the People's Republic of Albania

    On November 29, 1944, under the leadership of the Albanian Communist Party (the predecessor of the current Albanian Labor Party), the Albanian people defeated the German and Italian fascist occupying forces and their servants, and established a people's regime, thus opening a new path to a happy life. This is the greatest victory of the Albanian people, and the result of all the efforts made by the Albanian people for centuries and the many uprisings and struggles they have waged.
      Because Albania occupies a strategically important location, all past European and Asian invaders have attempted to occupy it, placing it in a state of enslavement in order to use it as a base for expanding power to the east or west. Therefore, throughout the historical process, the Albanian people have fought against enemies who were powerful and well-equipped. The enemy attempted to eliminate Albania. The Roman Empire and Turkey invaded it, massacring our people, but never succeeded in crushing our people's resistance, and never succeeded in stopping our people's struggle for freedom and survival. Under the leadership of the legendary hero Skanderbeg, the Albanian people insisted on independence for twenty-five years, and finally defeated the Ottoman Empire's army on all fronts in the fifteenth century.
    For several centuries, the Albanian people were ravaged by foreign rule, but they maintained their language, culture, customs, traditions of freedom, and generous spirit.
      On November 28, 1912, after countless uprisings and struggles, the Albanian people finally shattered the Turkish shackles that had ruled Albania for five centuries. However, the Albanian people still could not live a happy life. The feudal class that seized power still oppressed them, and they replaced Turkish occupation with the occupation of Western countries.
    On April 7, 1939, Mussolini's fascist bandits, equipped with modern equipment, attacked our country. Although betrayed by the Zogu group, the Albanian people still put up armed resistance against the invaders. Fierce bloody battles took place in Durrës, Vlora, and other places. These battles marked the beginning of our people's struggle for national liberation.
    After the Italian fascists occupied Albania, they colluded with our country's feudal bourgeoisie to deceive and enslave the people by all means. However, the struggle that began on the first day the invaders stepped into our territory never ceased and became increasingly widespread. Not only could the Italian fascists not use our people as cannon fodder for the invasion of Greece, but they also had to station heavy troops in various important centers in our country to maintain the security of the rear.
    However, no matter how ardently our people yearned for freedom and hated fascism, the national liberation struggle during this period was still passive and spontaneous. Only after the Nazi bandits launched a perfidious attack on the Soviet Union, the Second World War acquired the nature of a war of fascist aggression and anti-fascist aggression, and the Albanian Communist Party was founded (November 8, 1941), did the struggle of the Albanian people begin to acquire new and decisive significance.
    In its first declaration, the Albanian Communist Party announced its establishment and called on the people of the whole country to unite and wage an uncompromising struggle against the occupying forces until the complete liberation of the country. The Communist Party's call received a widespread response among the working class and laboring peasants, and therefore armed actions and attacks against the occupiers and traitors occurred at the end of 1941. The Communist Party organized the first guerrilla organizations in major cities. Although these guerrilla forces were poorly equipped, they deeply frightened the enemy. At the same time, the Communist Party extensively carried out propaganda activities in cities and villages. At the beginning of 1942, guerrilla warfare began throughout the country. The first liberated areas were established. At the same time, under the promotion of the Communist Party, a broad political organization, namely the National Liberation United Front, which aimed to unite all progressive forces in the anti-fascist struggle, was also established. A broad political struggle unfolded throughout the country. The Communist Party led the National Liberation United Front in political and military struggles.
    In July 1943, the Party Central Committee decided to establish the Supreme Command of the Albanian National Liberation Army, followed by the establishment of regional command posts. From then on, the guerrillas were better organized in their actions, thus posing a more serious threat to the enemy. A large number of enemy garrisons were attacked and annihilated, many important centers were liberated, and a large amount of materials and military equipment were seized to strengthen the guerrillas. On August 15, 1943, the First Division was established, followed by the successive establishment of other divisions, which greatly alarmed the occupying forces and traitors.
    In order to deal with the National Liberation Army, the fascists and feudal bourgeoisie came up with the magic weapon of the "Bali Kombëtar" traitorous organization, using coercion and inducement to organize militias and constabulary forces to fight the people together with the fascist divisions. Many areas were looted and burned down, and old people and children were massacred, but the struggle became even more intense. After Italy surrendered, Nazi Germany succeeded Italy in occupying Albania. The German invaders were more shameless and brutal than the Italian invaders. All reactionary forces recognized the thieves as their fathers and did everything they could to portray the new occupiers as saviors of our country, but the National Liberation United Front, under the leadership of the Communist Party, exposed all the tricks of the occupiers and traitors, and the national liberation movement not only did not stop, but also became more widespread. The first columns of Germans who came to invade our territory were severely attacked by our guerrillas.
    After losing hundreds of soldiers and dozens of vehicles, the Germans reorganized their forces and launched the first large-scale offensive against the National Liberation Army in the winter of 1943. They gathered a large number of troops, spared no sacrifices, swept through all liberated areas, killed all residents, and burned down tens of thousands of houses. However, the guerrillas withstood all tests. The result of this large-scale military operation was still a defeat for the occupying forces and traitors. As soon as the enemy's large-scale mopping-up operation ended, the guerrilla units re-entered the offensive and liberated the entire mountainous area of southern Albania. The army became stronger with the enlistment of new soldiers, and new divisions were successively established. In May 1944, the first representative conference of the National Liberation Committee was held in Përmet, at which the Albanian Provisional Supreme People's Power Organ—the Albanian Anti-Fascist National Liberation Council—and the Albanian National Liberation Committee headed by Enver Hoxha were formed. This representative conference also decided to establish the First Assault Division, responsible for liberating central and northern Albania.
    After the Përmet Conference, the Nazis and traitors launched a new offensive with even greater forces than last time. Although the guerrillas faced an enemy that was greatly superior in numbers and equipment, they still bravely maintained the liberated areas. This military operation continued for several weeks, and the Germans paid an even higher price than last time. In the end, the enemy still suffered a disastrous defeat. Before the German military operation was over, the troops of the First Division of the Liberation Army had penetrated deep into the north and, after several heroic battles, liberated all the mountainous areas of the central region. In the military operation, they also severely attacked the nests of the "Bali Kombëtar" traitorous organization, the security forces, and the constabulary forces. These anti-people armed forces were painstakingly cultivated by the Nazi occupying forces and the puppet government and received the assistance of the reactionary factions of Britain and the United States (especially the security forces). By the middle of 1944, the Nazis could only hold a few important centers, highways, and a part of the coastal plain. While the First Division and the northern guerrillas were still fighting to liberate various parts of the north, the southern guerrillas had completed the liberation of the entire south. After several weeks of fierce warfare, the National Liberation Army liberated Tirana, the capital of Albania, on November 17, 1944, followed by the liberation of the entire country. The Albanian National Liberation Army then sent two divisions to help the people of Yugoslavia liberate the areas adjacent to the People's Republic of Albania.
    The reason why the Albanian people were able to achieve success in the national liberation struggle was because they were carrying out this struggle under new historical conditions. The reason why the Albanian people finally achieved victory was because they were firm and unwavering and carried out a life-and-death struggle. They had the leadership of the Communist Party, which closely united the people of the whole country around the great organization of the National Liberation United Front. However, the decisive factor for our people's victory, just as the decisive factor for the victory of other enslaved peoples, was the victory of the glorious Soviet Union in the struggle against Nazi Germany and Fascist Japan. Therefore, our people's freedom and national independence were achieved with the help of the Soviet Union.
    It has been eleven years since Albania was liberated. Seeing Albania today, it is difficult for people to imagine the situation in Albania in the early days of liberation. Long years of enslavement had placed our country in the deepest darkness, and all previous construction had been destroyed in six years of struggle. Therefore, at the beginning of liberation, our country's economy was in a state of complete paralysis. After our country's liberation, the imperialists said that our people would certainly not be able to overcome the difficulties and would inevitably succumb to them. But this time it was the Soviet people who extended a helping hand to our people and once again assisted our country. The enthusiasm and spirit of sacrifice of the people engaged in national reconstruction work were no less than those in the struggle for national liberation. In a short period of time, all the bridges, highways, ports, cities, and towns have been repaired, and the life of the country has been normalized. Under these circumstances, the Party and the People's Government implemented major reform measures, such as nationalizing banks, mines, and transportation vehicles, confiscating the property of the big commercial bourgeoisie, and carrying out land reform, thereby eradicating the roots of feudal and capitalist forces in our country and the rule of foreign imperialism in our country. The Party and the government made the greatest efforts to restore the national economy, and strengthened the National Liberation Army with great strength, carrying out the work of reorganizing the guerrillas into regular troops. Thanks to the generous assistance of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, these problems have been well resolved by the Albanian people and the Party.
    After recovering our country from the ruins of war and normalizing the economy to a certain extent, our people immediately began large-scale construction undertakings. In the past eleven years, the face of our country has completely changed. Dozens of factories and integrated plants have been established, thereby increasing our industrial production to 11.7 times that of the pre-war year of 1938. In 1954, the sown area increased by 70 percent compared with 1938, and the total value of agricultural products reached twice that of pre-war. In recent years, 4,200 kilometers of irrigation canals have been excavated. Hundreds of tractors and tens of thousands of tons of mineral fertilizers have been shipped to our country from the Soviet Union. The state-owned economy and cooperative economic components are constantly expanding and strengthening.
    Before the war, almost 80 percent of the population was illiterate, but today illiteracy has been eliminated. The number of primary and secondary schools has increased almost tenfold compared with before the war, and six new institutions of higher learning have been built, which have already begun to send out senior talents this year. Culture, art, and literature have achieved unprecedented development. The brilliant achievements in our people's lives have made the prospects unfolding before our people even more magnificent. Many state-owned enterprises have announced that they have successfully implemented the first five-year plan, and all statistics indicate that the plan for the last year of the five-year plan will not only be completed but also overfulfilled by the end of this year. The implementation of the second five-year plan will bring even greater achievements to the Albanian people.
    On the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of liberation, the love and thoughts of the Albanian people are turned to the Soviet people. The Albanian people were liberated with the help of the Soviet people, and they are grateful for the generous and constant assistance that the Soviet people have already given and continue to give. This assistance has made it possible for the Albanian people to create a new and happy life.
    Our people deeply care about the great fraternal Chinese people. Our two peoples have many similarities in the past history and at present. Like the Albanian people, the Chinese people have been subjected to long periods of enslavement. The two peoples have waged selfless struggles for freedom throughout their history, and they have achieved freedom by relying on legendary struggles and the wise leadership of their Communist Parties—the Communist Party of China and the Albanian Labor Party. Our two peoples are equally selflessly sacrificing to eliminate backwardness and successfully laying the foundation of socialism in our respective countries. The fraternal feelings of the Albanian people for the Chinese people are growing deeper day by day. The assistance that the People's Republic of China has given and continues to give to the People's Republic of Albania has played a significant role in the economic growth of our country. On the occasion of the eleventh anniversary of liberation, the Albanian people wholeheartedly congratulate the Chinese people on their more brilliant achievements in creating a new and happy life, and wish for the liberation of all territories of China.

　　阿尔巴尼亚解放十一周年
　　阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国国防部副部长　巴纳约·普拉古少将
    阿尔巴尼亚人民于一九四四年十一月二十九日在阿尔巴尼亚共产党（即现在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的前身）领导下，击败德意法西斯占领军及其仆从们，建立了人民政权，从而开辟了新的幸福生活的道路。这是阿尔巴尼亚人民的最伟大的胜利，这是阿尔巴尼亚人民几世纪以来所作的一切努力和所进行的许多次起义和斗争的成果。
      由于阿尔巴尼亚占着极重要的战略地点，过去欧洲和亚洲的一切侵略者都曾企图加以占领，使它处于被奴役的地位，以便作为向东方或西方扩张势力的一个基地。因此，在整个历史过程中，阿尔巴尼亚人民对势大力强、装备优越的敌人进行了斗争。敌人曾企图消灭阿尔巴尼亚。罗马帝国和土耳其侵略过它，他们屠杀我国人民，但是从未能粉碎我国人民的抵抗，从未能停止我国人民争取自由和生存的斗争。阿尔巴尼亚人民在传奇式的英雄斯坎德培领导下坚持独立二十五年，终于在各个战线上击溃了十五世纪的奥斯曼帝国的大军。
    好几个世纪中阿尔巴尼亚人民受到异族统治的蹂躏，但是他们却保持他们的语言文化、风俗习惯、爱好自由的传统和慷慨豪迈的气概。
      一九一二年十一月二十八日，阿尔巴尼亚人民经过了无数次的起义和斗争终于粉碎了五世纪来统治阿尔巴尼亚的土耳其羁绊，但是阿尔巴尼亚人民仍不能过幸福的日子，攫得政权的封建阶级仍旧压在他们头上，他们以西方国家的占领代替土耳其的占领。
    一九三九年四月七日，拥有现代化装备的墨索里尼法西斯匪帮进攻我国。阿尔巴尼亚人民虽然遭到索古集团的出卖，仍对侵略者进行了武装抵抗。在都拉斯、发罗拉等地进行了剧烈的血战。这些战斗标志着我国人民争取民族解放的开端。
    意大利法西斯占领阿尔巴尼亚后，即勾结我国封建资产阶级在一起，用尽一切办法来欺骗和奴役人民，但是侵略者踏进我国领土第一天起就开始了的斗争从未停止，并且越来越扩大。意大利法西斯不但不能利用我国人民，把我国人民当作侵略希腊的炮灰，而且他们还不得不在我国各重要中心驻扎重兵以保持后方的安全。
    但是，尽管我国人民如何热烈地向往自由、憎恨法西斯，但这个时期的民族解放斗争还带有消极性和自发性，只是在纳粹匪帮发动对苏联的背信弃义的进攻、第二次世界大战具有了法西斯侵略和反法西斯侵略的战争性质和阿尔巴尼亚共产党成立
  （一九四一年十一月八日）之后，阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争始获得新的决定性的意义。
    阿尔巴尼亚共产党在它第一篇宣言中，宣布自己的成立并号召全国人民团结一致对占领军进行毫不妥协的斗争，直到全国解放。共产党的号召在工人阶级和劳动农民中间得到广泛响应，因此一九四一年年底就发生了反对占领者和卖国贼的武装行动和袭击。共产党在各主要城市组织了第一批游击组织，这些游击队伍虽然装备窳陋，但已使敌人深感恐惧。同时共产党在城市和农村中广泛地展开宣传活动。一九四二年年初，全国范围内开始了游击战。第一批解放区建立起来了。同时在共产党推动下，广大的政治组织，即旨在团结全国一切进步力量进行反法西斯斗争的民族解放统一阵线也建立起来了。全国展开广泛的政治斗争。共产党领导着民族解放统一阵线进行政治斗争和军事斗争。
    一九四三年七月，党中央决定建立阿尔巴尼亚民族解放军最高司令部，继之建立了区域指挥部。游击队从此行动上有了更好的组织，从而对敌人形成了更严重的威胁。大量的敌人驻军遭到攻击和歼灭，许多重要中心被解放了，大批物资和军事装备被缴获用来加强了游击队。一九四三年八月十五日第一师成立，继之其他各师络续成立，使占领军和卖国贼大感恐慌。
    法西斯和封建资产阶级为了对付民族解放军，拿出了“巴里·康毕塔尔”卖国组织的法宝，用威逼利诱手段组织民团和宪兵队，与法西斯师团一起来打击人民。许多地区被劫掠一空和放火毁灭，老年人和儿童被残杀，但斗争却更为剧烈。意大利投降后，纳粹德国继意大利占领了阿尔巴尼亚。德国侵略者较诸意大利侵略者更加无耻和残暴。所有反动势力却认贼作父，竭尽所能把新占领者说成我国的救星，但是民族解放统一阵线在共产党领导下揭穿了占领者和卖国贼的一切花招，民族解放运动不但绝无停止，而且规模更为广大。德国第一批开来侵略我国领土的纵队就受到我国游击队的痛击。
    德国人损失了数百名兵士和数十部车辆后重新组织力量，于一九四三年冬季向民族解放军发动第一次大规模攻势。他们集合大批军队，不惜牺牲，扫荡所有解放区，杀害所有居民，焚毁成千万间房屋。但是游击队经住了一切考验。这次大规模军事行动的结果仍是占领军和卖国贼遭受了失败。敌人的大规模扫荡行动一结束，游击队各单位又重新进入攻势，解放了阿尔巴尼亚南部整个山区。军队有了新兵入伍而更为壮大，新的师团络续成立起来。一九四四年五月在波列梅特城召开了民族解放委员会第一次代表会议，会上组成了阿尔巴尼亚临时最高人民政权机关——阿尔巴尼亚反法西斯民族解放会议和以恩·霍查为首的阿尔巴尼亚民族解放委员会。这次代表大会又决定建立第一突击师团，担负解放阿尔巴尼亚中部及北部的任务。
    波列梅特代表大会之后，纳粹和卖国贼又用比上次更强大的兵力发动新的攻势。游击队虽然面对的是一个人数上装备上都占极大优势的敌人，但还是英勇地保持了解放区。这次军事行动继续了好几个星期，德国人付出比上次更高的代价，结果敌人还是惨败了。德军军事行动尚未结束，解放军第一师的部队已深入北部，经过几场英勇的战斗后解放了中部的所有的山区。在军事行动中并痛捣“巴里·康毕塔尔”卖国组织、保安团和宪兵队的窝窠，这些反人民的武装力量是纳粹占领军和傀儡政府煞费苦心培养起来并获得英美反动派的援助的
  （尤其是保安团）。一九四四年年中，纳粹已经只能保持几个重要中心、公路和一部分沿海平原地区。当第一师和北部游击队还在解放北部各地而作战的时候，南部游击队已完成了整个南部的解放。民族解放军经过几个星期的剧烈战争于一九四四年十一月十七日解放了阿尔巴尼亚的首都地拉那，继之解放了全国。阿尔巴尼亚民族解放军随即派出两个师前往帮助南斯拉夫人民，解放与阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国毗邻的各地区。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民所以能取得民族解放斗争的成就，因为他们是在新的历史条件下进行这个斗争，阿尔巴尼亚人民所以终于取得胜利，因为他们坚定不移，进行了生死的斗争。他们有着共产党的领导，共产党把全国人民紧紧地团结在民族解放统一阵线伟大组织的周围。但是决定我国人民胜利的因素，正如决定其他被奴役的人民胜利的因素一样，是光荣的苏联对纳粹德国和法西斯日本所进行的斗争的胜利，因此我国人民获得自由和民族独立就是靠了苏联的帮助。
    阿尔巴尼亚解放已有十一年了。看到今日的阿尔巴尼亚，人们是难于想像解放初期阿尔巴尼亚所处的情况的。长期的奴役地位已使我国处在一片最深的黑暗中，以前的一切建设在六年的斗争中毁坏殆尽。因此解放之初，我国的经济已处于整个瘫痪状态。帝国主义者在我国解放后说我国人民一定不能克服困难，必然会屈从他们。但是这次又是苏联人民向我国人民伸出手来，再一次援助了我国。人民从事国家重建工作的热情和牺牲精神是不下于争取民族解放的斗争的。在短短时间内，所有的桥梁、公路、港口、城市乡镇都已修复，国家的生活也已正常化。在这种情况下，党和人民政府实行了重大的改革措施，如将银行、矿厂、交通工具收归国有，没收大商业资产阶级的财产并进行了土地改革，从而铲除了我国的封建和资本主义势力以及外国帝国主义在我国的统治的根基。党和政府以最大的努力从事恢复国民经济，以很大力量加强民族解放军，进行改编游击队为正规军的工作。由于苏联和其他人民民主国家的慷慨帮助，这些问题都被阿尔巴尼亚人民和党很好地解决了。
    把我国从战争的废墟中恢复过来并使经济恢复到一定程度的正常化之后，我国人民即着手进行大规模的建设事业。十一年中间，我国的面貌已完全改变了。几十个工厂和综合工厂已建立起来，从而使我国工业生产提高到战前一九三八年的十一点七倍。一九五四年，播种面积比一九三八年增加百分之七十，农产品总值达到战前的两倍。最近几年来，开掘了四千二百公里的灌溉渠。数百辆拖拉机和数万吨的矿物肥料已从苏联运来我国。国营经济和合作社经济成分不断扩大和加强。
    战前，差不多百分之八十的人口是文盲，而今天文盲已消灭了。中小学校比战前差不多增加十倍，新建的高等学校有六所，这些高等学校今年已开始输送高级人材了。文化、艺术、文学已取得了空前的发展。我国人民生活中的辉煌成就使我国人民面前展开的远景更加光芒万丈。许多国营企业宣布它们已顺利地执行了第一个五年计划，所有统计数字指出，今年年底，五年计划的最后一年计划不但会完成而且会超额完成。第二个五年计划的实行将给阿尔巴尼亚人民带来更大的成就。
    当解放十一周年的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民的热爱和思想是转向苏联人民的。阿尔巴尼亚人民是靠了苏联人民的援助而获得自由的，他们感激苏联人民已经给予并不断给予的慷慨和经常的帮助，这种援助使阿尔巴尼亚人民有可能创造新的幸福的生活。
    我国人民深切地关怀伟大的兄弟般的中国人民。我们两国人民在过去历史上和目前都有许多相似的地方。中国人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民一样受过长时期的奴役。两国人民在他们整个历史过程中曾为自由进行过忘我的斗争，他们都是依靠传奇式的斗争，依靠它们的共产党——中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的明智的领导才获得自由的。我们两国人民同样地以忘我牺牲的精神来消灭落后状况，成功地在本国奠立社会主义的基础。阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民兄弟们的感情一天比一天深厚。中华人民共和国给予了，并不断给予阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的帮助，在我国经济增长中已起着重大的作用。当解放十一周年的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心地祝贺中国人民在创造新的幸福的生活中取得更辉煌的成就，祝望中国的一切领土都获得解放。
                              （本报特约稿）
