At the Construction Site of the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant
    Mou Chengqi Wu Guangtian
    Recently, we visited the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant—a key project in the first Five-Year Plan. Here, we saw the soldiers on the construction posts, who, with full confidence and selfless labor, are turning the great Five-Year Plan into reality.
    This project is divided into four phases. The first and second phases have already taken almost two years. Judging from the speed already achieved, the third and fourth phases of construction now underway will only take one year and six months to complete. The entire Fuxin Thermal Power Plant can be successfully built half a year ahead of schedule.
    This is a technically complex project. Its boiler steel frame is about twenty meters high, but the position of the top and bottom, left and right cannot differ by a few millimeters. Its turbine, weighing about a hundred tons and as big as a fountain, requires the installation position to be accurate to less than half a hair's breadth. After the generator starts running, at a high speed of 1,500 revolutions per minute, the limit of its swing from side to side cannot exceed half the thickness of a hair. With the enthusiastic help of Soviet experts, the builders here have ensured that the project quality fully meets the design standards.
    The state requires a cost reduction of 8.86 percent, but the builders here have actually reduced it by 11.39 percent, overfulfilling the annual cost reduction plan before National Day.
    "Conquering time, striving for speed" is the battle cry of the builders of the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant. Once, the welding of a row of pipes on the desuperheater steam drum of a certain boiler needed to be reworked, but a row of pipes on the outside blocked the welding torch. The workers devised a long welding torch that could be extended through the gaps in the pipes for welding. In this operation, the worker's eyes were nearly one meter away from the weld, which was very tiring after a while, but they persevered for more than half a month, so that the project, which originally needed to be delayed for more than fifty days, was only delayed for a few days. The concrete workers were even more arduous, having to climb into the formwork dozens of meters deep. Concrete slid down from above, splashing mortar all over their faces and bodies. But they insisted on compacting and always completed their tasks ahead of schedule. In the critical moments when the project might not be completed, the workers always exerted their greatest strength to reverse the crisis. At the boiler construction site, security guard Tian Xikui told us such a thing:
    The front water-cooled wall of a certain boiler was originally planned to be hoisted up on September 20, but suddenly a problem occurred: the welding was unqualified and had to be reworked. As a result, the leaders thought that a delay was inevitable, but the workers of the second shift, who were responsible for this hoisting task, made a guarantee: "Resolutely complete the task on schedule!"
    On the night of September 19—the night before the project was due, the outside of the factory building was pitch black, and Wang Huanshun, the deputy head of the second shift, was still working with the workers. The night shift workers and the construction site leaders urged him to go back to sleep, but he said with a smile, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter if I don't sleep for a day or two, it's important to complete the task!" He turned around and led the workers to work again. It wasn't until he saw the three-zhang-tall water-cooled wall hoisted onto the boiler and the task completed on schedule that he happily walked out of the construction site.
    The builders here not only use all their enthusiasm and wisdom to complete construction tasks, but also constantly use actions to fight against conservative ideas that hinder the progress of the project and delay the speed. The unprecedented speed created by the people who installed a certain boiler is a typical example. For this boiler project, from erecting the huge steel frame to installing the large steam drum, hundreds of tons of pipes, equipment, and materials had to be hoisted piece by piece. During the first and second phases of construction, it took two months to do this work. Now, the construction site plans to use one month. However, Soviet expert Kostrikov suggested using half a month. At that time, some people shook their heads repeatedly, thinking that this was "impossible" and "risky." However, the construction site leaders resolutely accepted the expert's suggestion, re-arranged the installation plan, and made full use of every minute and every second, and adopted interspersed operations as much as possible for hoisting, installation, and welding. As a result, it took exactly fifteen days to complete. Soviet expert Kostrikov said happily: "Dear comrades, I congratulate you! Completing the task from erecting the steel frame to hoisting the large steam drum at such a speed is the highest speed even in the Soviet Union, and it is the first new record in China. I have already written a letter to tell my friends in the country about this significant event so that they also know what speed the Chinese working class is using to build their great motherland."
    In the third shift of the boiler construction site, there is a 55-year-old worker named Huang Xueyun. He said: "I can't explain the big principles well, but I know that I am working for myself now. A power plant is different from other projects. If the quality cannot be guaranteed, there will be accidents in the future!"
    Huang Xueyun repeatedly said these words, and his partners did not find it annoying. Because the spirit of the old worker represents their own attitude and feelings towards project quality. In the process of implementing the construction plan, they can overcome any difficulties in order to ensure quality. Once, in the scorching sun, at the turbine construction site, five young workers, Cai Jingtian, An Yulin, Liu Jingwen, Jiang Xinhe, and Ren Zuochen, each carried a file, bent over and crawled into the undercarriage room propped up with sleepers, with their heads up. As soon as they crawled in, they were covered in sweat, and it was so hot that they couldn't breathe. The iron filings falling from the components fell on their faces and collars, and when they met the sweat, they were particularly stinging. They persisted in this way for four days, so that the quality of this project, which had not been adjusted well for two days, met the requirements suggested by the Soviet experts.
    In March, Kong Qingxiang led a group of apprentices to undertake the repair work of the concrete foundation. The quality requirements for the repair work are: when the smooth shim is placed on the cement surface of the foundation, the contact surface between the two must reach 70 percent, and when the level is placed on it, the level bubble must remain at "zero."
    At the meeting, more than sixty workers doing repair work were troubled by the inability to meet such strict requirements. What to do? The cement surface is brittle and not easy to grind precisely. If you hit it with a flat-topped hammer, a large piece will fall off. If you hit it with a pointed hammer, it will produce pockmarks.
      "How about we put some brick powder under the shim and grind the cement surface of the foundation?" Someone said hesitantly.
      "Brick powder is too coarse, it won't work."
    The meeting place was temporarily quiet, and everyone was thinking deeply.
      "Use chalk!" Suddenly someone spoke up under the inspiration of brick powder. This suggestion immediately attracted people's attention, and the discussion became heated.
      "Put chalk on the bottom of the shim, put the shim on the joint surface of the cement foundation, and see where the chalk sticks to the cement surface, and then scrape off that point..."
      "This is a good method!"
    The next day, they did this for a day, and then put the shim on the foundation, and the foundation and the shim seemed to have become a whole. In this way, they solved an important problem in project quality.
    At the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant construction site, people are meticulous about every bit of material used in construction, and even a few yuan of loss is called a "serious lesson." In the boiler construction site, there is a Dong Tingyu insulation team. Their task is to lay pieces of asbestos board on the outside of many steel pipes of different diameters, and then wrap the asbestos board with wire mesh, and apply a layer of asbestos ash. Asbestos board is extremely easy to break, and there are often many fragments lost during work. The workers of the Dong Tingyu team collected the fragments from all corners and used them piecemeal. They found that the scaffolders threw the waste iron wire removed from the scaffolding on the ground, which they felt was a great pity, so they collected them one by one, straightened them with a hammer, cut them into small sections, made them into iron clips, and used them on the project. In the insulation project of a boiler flue alone, they saved the state more than 1,000 kilograms of asbestos board, more than 30 square meters of wire mesh, and more than 30 kilograms of iron wire in this way.
    At the turbine construction site, the creation of the Lan Baofa bending pipe team in saving work has been praised by many people. The task of the bending pipe team is to bend various straight pipes of different sizes into various types of bends. One day in July, the technician handed Lan Baofa a bending pipe drawing of the boiler pulverized coal pipe. Lan Baofa went to the warehouse to check the materials according to the drawing and found that there was a kind of thick pipe with a diameter of 337 cm and a length of 11 or 12 meters, but the pipe required for each bending pipe on the drawing was 8 or 9 meters. Each pipe had to be cut off with a leftover of 2 to 3 meters. Lan Baofa thought: "The remaining material is usable, this project doesn't need it, other power stations can use it, but it will be difficult to deal with the leftover." He repeatedly read the drawings and found that if the large bends and small bends on each drawing were used together (the large bends need longer pipes, and the small bends use shorter ones), the pipe that originally only bent two bends could bend three bends. He used iron wire to bend two shapes as steel pipes to show the technician. The technician felt that it made sense, so he drew a picture based on his suggestion and gave it to the engineer, which was approved. A large number of pipes were saved in this way.

　　在阜新火力发电站工地上
　　牟承启　吴光田
    最近我们访问了阜新火力发电站——第一个五年计划中的一个重点工程。在这里，我们看到了建设岗位上的战士们，是那样信心百倍地以忘我的劳动把伟大的五年计划变成现实。
    这项工程分四期进行，第一期和第二期工程已差不多用去了两年的时间，现在施工的第三期和第四期工程，从已达到的速度来看，只需要一年零六个月的时间就可完成。整个阜新火力发电站可以提前半年建设成功。
    这是一项技术极复杂的工程，它的锅炉钢架高约二十多公尺，但是竖立起来上下左右的位置不能差几个公厘。它的重约百吨的、像一个喷水池那样大的汽轮机，安装的位置要求不许差半根头发丝的间隙。它的发电机运转起来之后，要求在每分钟一千五百转的高速下，左右摇摆的限度不超过一根头发的厚度的一半。这里的建设者在苏联专家的热忱帮助下，使工程质量完全达到了设计标准。
    国家要求降低成本百分之八点八六，这里的建设者实际已降低了百分之十一点三九，在国庆节前夕超额完成了全年降低工程成本计划。
    “战胜时间，争取速度”，是阜新火力发电站建设者的战斗口号。有一次某号锅炉的减温汽包上的一排管子的焊接需要返工，但是这排管子外边的一排管子挡住了电焊把，工人就研究出一种长电焊把，从管子的空隙中伸进去焊接。这样操作，工人的眼睛距离焊口将近一公尺，焊一会儿就很吃力，他们却坚持了半个多月，使原来需要拖期五十多天的工程，仅仅耽误了几天。混凝土工人更艰苦，要爬进几十公尺深的模型板里去，混凝土从上面滑落下来，溅得满身满脸都是灰浆。但是他们坚持捣固，一向提前完成任务。在工程可能完不成的紧要关头，工人们总是拿出最大的力量扭转危急局面。在锅炉工地，保安员田喜魁向我们讲了这样一件事情：
    某号锅炉的前侧冷水壁，原来计划九月二十日吊上去，可是突然发生了问题：焊接不合格，必须返工。这一来，领导上以为非拖期不可，但是，担负这项吊装任务的二班工人提出了保证：“坚决按期完成任务！”
    九月十九号夜里——工程到期的头一天晚上，厂房外面一片漆黑，二班副班长王焕顺还在和工人
  一起操作。夜班工人和工地领导人员催促他回去睡觉，他却笑呵呵地说：“不要紧，一天两天不睡觉没关系，完成任务要紧！”他转一个圈又领工人干上了。一直到看见那三丈来高的冷水壁吊装在锅炉上面，按期完成任务以后，才高高兴兴地走出了工地。
    这里的建设者们不仅用自己的全部热情和智慧去完成建设任务，而且时刻用行动跟阻碍工程前进、延缓速度的保守思想进行斗争。安装某号锅炉的人们创造空前的速度就是一个典型的例证。这一座锅炉工程，从立起巨大的钢架到安装大汽包，要把上百吨重的管子、设备和器材都一件一件地吊装上去。在第一期和第二期施工的时候，做好这些工作，需要两个月，现在工地计划用一个月。可是苏联专家克斯特里阔夫同志建议用半个月时间。当时，有的人连连摇头，认为这是“不可能的”，是
  “冒险”。但是，工地领导方面坚决接受专家建议，重新排了安装计划，把每一分钟、每一秒钟的时间都加以充分利用，把起重、安装、焊接尽可能采取穿插作业。结果正好用了十五天就完成了。苏联专家克斯特里阔夫同志很高兴地说：“亲爱的同志们，我向你们祝贺！用这样的速度完成了从立钢架到吊装完大汽包的任务，在苏联来说也是最高的速度，在中国来说还是第一次的新纪录。我已经写信把这件具有重大意义的事情告诉给国内的朋友们，让他们也都知道：中国的工人阶级是用什么样的速度在建设自己的伟大祖国。”
    在锅炉工地的第三班里，有一个五十五岁的老工人，名叫黄学运。他说：“大道理我说不好，但是我知道现在是给自己干活。发电站可不同旁的工程，若是保不住质量，以后发生了事故还得了！”
    黄学运反复讲着这些话，他的伙伴们听了并不嫌噜苏。因为老工人这种精神正是代表了他们自己对待工程质量的态度和感情。在执行建设计划过程中，为了保证质量，任何困难他们都可以克服。有
  一次，炎日当空的时候，在汽机工地上，蔡景田、安玉林、刘景文、蒋信和、任左臣五个青年工人，每个人带着一把锉，扁着身子钻到用枕木垫起来的下车室里仰着头工作。他们刚一钻进去便满头是汗，闷热得喘不上气。部件上落下的铁沫掉在他们的脸上和衣领里，一见汗水，格外刺人。他们这样坚持了四天，使这个调整了两天还没调整好的工程，质量达到了苏联专家建议的要求。
    三月份，孔庆祥领着一批徒工承担了混凝土基础的修整工作。修整工程的质量要求是：光滑的垫铁放在基础的水泥面上的时候，两者的接触面要达到百分之七十，水平尺放在上面，水平珠要停留在
  “零”上。
    在碰头会上，六十多个做修整活的工人都为达不到这样的严格要求而苦恼。怎么办呢？水泥面脆，不好研得精密。用平顶锤砸吧，一砸就掉一大片。用尖锤砸吧，一砸又出麻子。
      “咱们找些砖粉铺在垫铁下，研磨基础的水泥面好不好？”有人不很肯定地说。
      “砖头粉面太粗，不行。”
    会场出现了暂时的平静，每个人都在深思。
      “用粉笔吧！”突然有人在砖粉的启示下发言了。这个建议顿时引起人们的注意，发言热烈起来。
      “把粉笔涂在垫铁的底下，把垫铁放在水泥基础的接合面上，看水泥上哪点粘上了粉笔面，就把哪点刨掉……”
      “这是个好办法！”
    第二天，他们这样做了一天，再把垫铁放在基础上，基础和垫铁好像已经成了一个整体。就这样，他们把工程质量上的一个重要问题解决了。
    在阜新火力发电站工地，人们对建设上用的一点一滴的资材都精打细算，即使是几元钱的损失，他们都叫做“严重的教训”。在锅炉工地有个董廷玉保温小组，他们所担负的工作是在许多直径不同的钢管外面铺上一片片的石绵板，再用铁丝网把石绵板包扎起来，抹上一层石绵灰。石绵板极容易破碎，干活的时候经常有很多碎片失落了。董廷玉小组的工人们，从各个角落里把碎片搜集起来，一片片地拼着利用了。他们发现架子工把从脚手架上拆下的废铁丝扔在地上，觉得非常可惜，便一根根地搜集了来，用铁锤砸直了，切成小段做成铁卡子用到工程上了。仅仅在一个锅炉烟道的保温工程上，他们就这样给国家节省了一千多公斤石绵板，三十多平方公尺的铁丝网和三十多公斤铁丝。
    在汽机工地，蓝宝发弯管小组在节约工作上的创造受到许多人的称赞。弯管小组的任务是把各种大大小小的直管弯成各种型式的弯管。七月的一天，技术员把一份锅炉粉煤管的弯管图纸交给了蓝宝发。蓝宝发根据图纸到仓库去对照材料，发现有一种直径三百三十七公分的粗管子，长度是十一、十二公尺，但是，每张图纸弯管所需要的管子是八、九公尺。每根管子必须截下二公尺到三公尺的零头。蓝宝发想：“剩下成材，这个工程不需要，别的电站还能用，若剩下零头可就难办了。”他反复地翻阅图纸，发现如果把各张图纸上的大弯和小弯搭配着用（大弯需要较长的管子，小弯用的较短），原来只弯两弯的管子，足可以弯三个弯。他用铁丝当钢管弯了两个样子给技术员看。技术员觉得有道理，便根据他的建议画了一张图给工程师，得到了批准。大量的管子便这样地被节省下来了。（附图片）
    阜新火力发电站透平工地第三期安装工程，已经完成了工程量的百分之七十。这是工人们正在安装汽轮机的转子。
