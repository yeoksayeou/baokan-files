　　Shanghai Private Wool Retailers All Implement Joint Public-Private Ownership
　　Preparatory Work for Joint Public-Private Ownership of Private Wool Textile Industry Nears Completion
    Our Newspaper Shanghai, 19th Dispatch: Shanghai's private wool retail businesses have entirely implemented joint public-private ownership. This is Shanghai's first retail industry to implement joint public-private ownership across the entire sector.
    Shanghai's private wool retail businesses established a distribution relationship with state-owned department stores last November, achieving preliminary transformation. After nine wool shops in the Songshan District were approved to implement joint public-private ownership at the beginning of November this year, capitalists in this industry were greatly inspired and encouraged, and they requested joint public-private ownership for the entire industry, submitting a formal application to the government on the 15th. The government has now approved their application.
    On the afternoon of the 18th, the Preparatory Committee for Joint Public-Private Ownership of Shanghai Wool Retail Businesses was officially established. When the news that joint public-private ownership for the entire industry had been approved spread, the workers were extremely excited. They organized celebration teams, beating gongs and drums, and setting off firecrackers to congratulate each other. Large red banners reading "Celebrating Joint Public-Private Ownership of the Wool Industry" were hung at the entrances of each wool shop. Nanjing East Road and Jing'an Temple and other streets in Shanghai were filled with a joyful atmosphere.
    Our Newspaper Shanghai, 19th Dispatch: Preparatory work for joint public-private ownership of Shanghai's private wool textile industry is nearing completion. The original fifty-two scattered and backward wool mills have been reorganized, after consolidation, into nineteen comprehensive mills with a full set of spinning, weaving, and dyeing equipment. Most factories have now completed preparations for joint public-private ownership and held celebrations. A celebration meeting for joint public-private ownership for the entire industry will also be held soon.
    This industry was approved to implement joint public-private ownership in the third quarter of this year. The broad masses of workers warmly support joint public-private ownership of the entire industry. Many capitalists also believe that joint public-private ownership of the entire industry is a good way to transform all factories in the industry. For example, Qian Xinyuan, a capitalist from Yuanfeng Wool Mill, said: "In the past, the wool textile industry could not complete the processing and ordering tasks it received due to its own limitations. After the implementation of mergers and joint public-private ownership, production tasks can be arranged in a unified manner, and funds and equipment can be mutually adjusted, learning from each other's strengths and overcoming the difficulties on the road of wool industry advancement." The broad masses of workers and many capitalists actively participated in the preparatory work for joint public-private ownership.
    By the end of October, all factories had completed the work of clearing assets and determining shares, and proper arrangements were made for the capitalists who were employed. During this period, many factories carried out merger work. After the mergers, the utilization rate of machinery and equipment has been greatly improved. Comprehensive factories that originally only operated day shifts have now switched to operating both day and night shifts, and the quality of products has also improved significantly. According to statistics from the China Department Store Company's Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station, the rate of first-class woolen fabrics in this industry was about 50% in the third quarter, and now the rate of first-class products has risen to over 90%. Yonghe Plush Mill was unable to produce export products in the past due to outdated machinery and equipment. Since merging into Hailong Plush Mill and using advanced machinery and equipment for production, it has been able to accept production tasks for export products.

### 上海私营绒线零售商全部实行公私合营　私营毛纺工业公私合营筹备工作接近完成

　　上海私营绒线零售商全部实行公私合营
　　私营毛纺工业公私合营筹备工作接近完成
    本报上海十九日电　上海市私营绒线零售商业全行业实行公私合营。这是上海市第一个全行业实行公私合营的零售商业。
    上海市私营绒线零售商业在去年十一月和国营百货公司建立了经销关系，获得了初步的改造。今年十一月初，嵩山区九家绒线店被批准全部实行公私合营以后，这个行业的资本家受到极大的启发和鼓舞，纷纷要求全行业公私合营，并在十五日向政府提出正式申请。现在政府已经批准他们的申请。
    十八日下午，上海市绒线零售商业公私合营筹备委员会已经正式成立。当全行业公私合营获得批准的消息传出后，职工极为兴奋。他们纷纷组织报喜队，敲锣打鼓，鸣放鞭炮，互相祝贺。各家绒线店门口也都挂上了“庆祝绒线业公私合营”的大红横幅。上海南京东路、静安寺等街道上，充满了一片喜气洋洋的欢乐景象。
    本报上海十九日电　上海市私营毛纺工业全行业公私合营的筹备工作已接近完成。旧有的五十二个分散落后的毛纺厂，经过裁并以后，组织成为十九家具有纺、织、染全套设备的全能厂。现在大部分工厂已经完成公私合营筹备工作，召开了庆祝公私合营大会。全业庆祝公私合营大会也即将召开。
    这个行业是在今年第三季度被批准实行公私合营的。广大职工热烈拥护全行业公私合营。许多资本家也认为全行业公私合营是改造全行业工厂的好办法。如元丰毛纺厂资本家钱欣元说：“以前毛纺工业因受本身条件限制，对所接受的加工定货任务不能很好完成。实行合并和公私合营以后，生产任务可以统一安排，资金、设备等方面能互相调剂，取长补短，克服了毛纺业前进道路上的困难。”广大职工和不少资本家都积极参加了公私合营筹备工作。
    十月底，各厂都结束了清产定股工作，对资本家实职人员也分别作了妥善的安排。在此期间，许多厂都进行了并厂工作。经过合并后，机器设备的利用率大大提高了，原来只开日班的全能厂，现在已改开日夜两班，产品质量也有了显著提高。根据中国百货公司上海采购供应站的统计，这个行业在第三季度呢绒的正品率在百分之五十左右，现在正品率已上升到百分之九十以上。永和长毛绒厂过去由于机器设备落后，不能生产出口产品，自从并进海龙长毛绒厂，利用先进机器设备生产以后，已经能接受出口产品的生产任务了。
