　　The Transformation of Private Grain Retailers in Shanghai

　　In the early days of liberation, when the free market still existed, the speculative activities of Shanghai grain merchants were rampant. For example, in June 1949, due to floods in rural areas, speculative grain merchants stirred up trouble, causing grain prices to rise fifteenfold in a month and a half. It was only after the People's Government took various measures that the price surge was quelled. Afterwards, grain merchants continued to seek various opportunities for speculation and profiteering. Thanks to the gradual growth of the state-owned economy and the government's strengthened leadership and management of the market, speculative activities of private grain merchants were promptly and effectively curbed, ensuring supply and stabilizing grain prices. This created the necessary prerequisite for carrying out the socialist transformation of private grain merchants in Shanghai.

　　In December 1953, in accordance with the state's order to implement a unified purchase and supply system for grain, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government began to carry out the socialist transformation of private grain retailers, converting all 1,498 private rice shops in the city into consignment shops for the state-owned grain company. These consignment shops handed over most of their working capital to the state-owned grain company as security deposits, and all commodities they handled were distributed by the state-owned company and sold at unified prices. Grain retailers throughout the city were thus brought into the orbit of state capitalism.

　　In the initial period of consignment sales, the profit and loss situation among the shops was extremely uneven. At that time, private rice shops competed for customers through means such as selling on credit, peddling, and accepting post-dated checks, resulting in some shops making substantial profits while others faced difficulties and could not maintain operations.

　　In response to the above situation, a comprehensive arrangement was initiated. Based on the past expenses of each shop, the quantity of grain for consignment sales was verified, and planned grain allocation was implemented to limit the sales of profitable shops and adjust the business of loss-making shops. At the same time, the expenses of loss-making shops were reduced by transferring and borrowing employees. In some areas, state-owned grain shops reduced some sales to take care of households in difficulty. Through the above measures, the unevenness of profits and losses was alleviated. However, because the supply targets were not fixed and the grain allocation plan was inaccurate, arrangements had to be made every month, affecting the progress of the transformation work. Moreover, some shops could not sell out the planned amount, while others experienced artificial shortages, so the problem of uneven profits and losses was not completely resolved. In August 1954, the city implemented a method of supplying designated areas at fixed locations, designating each shop to supply residents in a certain area. At the same time, the supply tasks and consignment sales commissions were adjusted, and the labor force and supply network were partially adjusted, which basically eliminated the unevenness of profits and losses between households, enabling the entire industry to maintain operations and make a slight profit. Before the implementation of the designated area supply, loss-making households accounted for more than 40 percent of the total number of households in the industry. After the implementation of the designated area supply, loss-making households dropped to 5 percent.

　　After the implementation of consignment sales, the free market was eliminated, and the opportunities for seeking exorbitant profits were greatly reduced. At the same time, the situation improved after arrangements were made, and capitalists generally developed a passive and dependent mentality, believing that consignment sales provided three guarantees: the state arranged the tasks, the sales targets were fixed, and the work was taken care of by the employees. They only had to collect money and remit funds, "making it easy." Some consignment shops still engaged in mixing substandard grain, short weighing, selling inferior products as good ones, illegally seeking profits, and embezzling grain and funds. Some capitalists withdrew capital and indulged in extravagance and waste, and business expenses also increased. It was difficult to investigate and verify these fraudulent and illegal activities of the capitalists because the accounts of each shop were incomplete, and the supervision of employees was restricted because the financial power was still in the hands of the capitalists. Another problem was that the distribution of grain shop supply networks was uneven, failing to meet the requirements of the gradually improving planned grain supply work. Moreover, there were too many small shops and households, making it difficult for the state to lead and manage. Therefore, how to strengthen leadership and absorb employees to participate in enterprise management, and appropriately adjust and reorganize the supply network, became the central content of further transforming private grain retailers. Before and after the implementation of quantitative supply this year, the following measures were also emphasized:

　　First, strengthen leadership, supervision, and management work organizationally and institutionally. Two things were mainly done: one was to reorganize the original consignment sales team composed of capital personnel. In August 1955, 109 grassroots grain shop management teams were established throughout the city with state-owned grain shops as the center and employee representatives participating. The head of the state-owned grain shop served as the leader, and representatives of employees and capitalists served as deputy leaders, which changed the nature of the original team. The other was to implement the principle of democratic management to enhance the status of employees in the enterprise. At the same time as the establishment of the management team, the shop affairs meeting system was promoted in each shop, and issues of operation and management were studied in the form of labor-capital consultation on a regular basis, so that employees participated in the management of the enterprise. The tasks of the management team were to implement the decisions and tasks of the higher authorities, guide and promote the improvement of operation and management of each shop, and supervise and exchange experiences with each other.

　　Second, establish a financial management system. The main contents of the financial management system were: implement a revenue and expenditure budget and final accounts system. The monthly expenses in the shop should be budgeted by the capital, and paid according to the budget after labor-capital consultation and consultation by the grassroots grain shop management team. At the end of the month, the final accounts should be prepared and reported; implement cash management. In addition to the necessary cash on hand, the excess cash should be deposited in the bank. After the implementation of the financial management system, the economic accounts of each shop were fully disclosed, and the working capital and surplus of the enterprise were managed, effectively preventing the capitalists from withdrawing capital and initially correcting unreasonable expenses. Some shops also changed the situation where the shop and the family were not separated. Employees were generally satisfied with the establishment of the financial system. Capitalists also believed that cash management was "beneficial to oneself and the country, killing two birds with one stone." The preliminary situation of the implementation of the financial management system showed that to effectively improve the operation and management of consignment shops and transform the capitalists' profit-seeking ideology, establishing a financial management system was an important step.

　　Third, adjust the supply network and organize the merger of small shops. When private rice shops were converted into consignment shops, there were 1,498 shops. After the merger, as of the end of September, there were only 1,032 shops. The principles of merging and adjusting the supply network were: it should be conducive to the planned grain supply and not affect the convenience of consumers to purchase; and it should be conducive to the implementation of the policy of transforming capitalist retailers. Therefore, it was necessary to strengthen education, fully consult, and proceed on a voluntary basis. In the merger, in order to solve the problem of uneven labor and unbalanced supervision, employees were uniformly allocated by the national grain department, and capital actual personnel were merged with the shop. Family members of the capital who participated in certain jobs were generally taken care of appropriately. For the capital who lost the ability to work, the children replaced them. Those who had difficulties in family life after the merger were also given appropriate subsidies. Other issues such as wealth funds were also handled more appropriately. Through the merger, the original shop and family separation were naturally separated, so the expenses were more reasonable. Some capitalists reflected: "The merger has five advantages: first, it can give full play to the potential and do a good job in planned supply; second, it can save expenses; third, it can establish a system; fourth, the work is disciplined, and you can take turns to rest; fifth, it is also good for personal transformation." However, in the organization of the merger in some areas, the principle of convenience for residents to purchase was not strictly controlled, and too many mergers were carried out, resulting in inconvenience for residents to purchase. Therefore, the organization of mergers must have a comprehensive plan and be carried out in an organized manner to make the distribution of the supply network more reasonable.

　　With the progress of enterprise transformation work, attention was also paid to the work of transforming the capitalists' thinking. The main thing was: to hold regular capitalist meetings to conduct ideological and policy education for the capitalists, arrange tasks, and conduct inspections and summaries. When illegal incidents were discovered in consignment shops, key capitalists in the same region were also organized to hold discussions, expose criticisms, and enhance everyone's awareness of patriotism and law-abiding. Capitalists who performed well in consignment sales were also frequently praised and encouraged, and the direction and future were pointed out for everyone. The gradual development of this dual transformation work not only gradually transformed the enterprise, but also initially transformed the capitalists themselves. At present, serious illegal acts such as mixing substandard grain, selling inferior products as good ones, and embezzling grain and funds in private grain shops have been basically eliminated, and phenomena such as short weighing, withdrawing capital, and expanding expenses have also been greatly reduced. Most shops have been able to pay national taxes according to law and on time. Many capitalists have participated in actual labor and are willing to transform the idea of ​​not working and gaining in actual labor. In the past, about half of the rice shop capitalists did not ask about shop affairs or participate in actual work. Now, except for a few who are old and weak, they have generally been assigned to actual work or management teams and other social activities. The phenomenon of being named and receiving dry salaries without doing anything has been basically eliminated. In the early days of consignment sales, some capitalists' understanding of their future was still vague. After arrangement, education, and gradual transformation, most capitalists have now recognized their future and are willing to transform in actual work.

　　At present, the status quo of Shanghai grain consignment shops is: although the transformation work has achieved great results, the enthusiasm of the masses of employees is still restricted because the relations of production have not been fundamentally changed. In particular, small shops and family shops account for a large proportion. There are few people, the equipment is simple, and there is a lack of employee supervision. Their decentralized and backward operation status cannot meet the requirements of the grain rationing supply system. The distribution of the commercial network is not reasonable enough. The employees of each shop, especially the backbone force, cannot be completely adjusted in a planned and rational manner according to the needs of supply and management. The unreasonable situation of wages among employees is still quite serious and has not been given the necessary adjustments in accordance with the principle of distribution according to work. On the other hand, the capitalist style of management has not been completely changed, and there are still a few illegal acts. This shows that if the relations of production are not completely changed, these problems cannot be fundamentally solved, and they cannot adapt to the development of the economic situation in the future. In order to adapt to the development of the economic construction situation in the future, ensure the thorough implementation of the policy of unified purchase and sales of grain, and completely transform private grain retailers into socialist commerce within a certain period, it has become a prominent task of the current national grain work.

　　上海改造私营粮食零售商的经过
　　忻良
    解放初期，在自由市场仍然存在的时候，上海粮商的投机活动很猖狂，例如一九四九年六月，由于农村遭受了水灾，投机粮商就兴风作浪，使粮价在一个半月里上涨了十五倍，经人民政府采取了各种措施，才把涨风平定下来。此后粮食商人还是不断寻找各种机会投机倒把。由于国营经济力量的逐步壮大，国家又加强了对市场的领导和管理，随时有力地打击了私营粮商的投机活动，保证了供应，稳定了粮价，这样就为对上海私营粮商进行社会主义改造创造了必要的前提。
    一九五三年十二月，上海市人民政府根据国家实行粮食统购统销的命令，对私营粮食零售商开始进行社会主义改造，把全市一千四百九十八家私营米店改为国营粮食公司的代销店。这些代销店把大部分的流动资金交给国营粮食公司作为保证金，经营的商品全部由国营公司分配，并且按统一的价格出售。全市粮食零售商开始纳入了国家资本主义轨道。
    代销初期，店和店之间的盈亏情况极不平衡。当时，私营米店相互以赊销、兜销、收取远期支票等竞销手段争取顾客，以致一部分店获利很多，一部分店仍有困难，无法维持。
    针对上述情况，就开始了全面安排工作。根据各店过去的开支情况，核定代销粮食的数量，并实行计划拨粮，以限制盈余户的销量，调节亏损户的业务；同时，还用调借职工的办法来降低亏损户的开支，部分地区由国营粮店让出部分销量，对困难户进行照顾。通过以上措施，盈亏不平衡的情况得到缓和，但是因为供应对象不固定，拨粮计划不准确，不仅月月忙于安排，影响了改造工作的进展，而且造成有些店按计划销售不完，有些店不够销的人为脱销现象，盈亏不平衡的问题还没有彻底解决。一九五四年八月，全市实行了划片定点供应办法，指定每一店供应一定地段的居民，同时调整了供应任务和代销手续费，并且部分地调整了劳动力和供应网，就基本上消除了户和户之间盈亏不平衡的现象，使整个行业能够维持，并且稍有利润可得。在划片定点供应以前，亏损户约占整个行业总户数的百分之四十以上，实行划片定点供应后，亏损户即降为百分之五。
    实行代销以后，自由市场消灭了，追逐暴利的机会大大减少；同时，经过安排情况好转了，资本家普遍产生了一种消极依赖思想，认为代销后有了三个保证：任务由国家安排；销售对象固定了；工作有职工包下来，自己只收收钞票，解解款“落得轻松”。收款时钞票少了可以开账，营业中米少了可以报损耗，因而认为“好像坐在保险箱里”。部分代销店在经营中掺杂、短秤、以次充好，非法牟利，挪用粮食、粮款等现象仍有发生。部分资本家抽逃资金，挥霍浪费，企业开支也随着扩大。对资本家这些舞弊违法行为，由于各店账务都不健全，很难查核，加上财政权仍操在资本家手里，职工的监督受到限制。另一问题是：粮食店供应网的分布疏密不匀，不能符合于粮食计划供应工作逐步提高的要求，而且店小户多，国家也不易领导管理。所以，如何加强领导和吸收职工参加企业管理，并且适当地调整和改组供应网，就成为深入一步改造私营粮食零售商的中心内容。今年实行定量供应前后，又着重采取了下列几项措施：
    第一，从组织上、制度上加强领导、监督和管理工作。主要作了两件事：一件是改组原由资方人员组成的纯业务性的代销小组，在一九五五年八月，全市建立了一百零九个以国营粮店为中心、有职工代表参加的基层粮店管理小组，由国营粮店的负责人担任正组长，职工和资本家的代表分任副组长，这就使原来的小组起了质的变化；一件是贯彻执行民主管理的原则，以提高职工在企业中的地位。和建立管理小组的同时，推动各店相应地健全了店务会议制度，定期以劳资协商的形式，研究经营管理上的问题，使职工参加了企业的管理。管理小组的任务是贯彻执行上级的决定和任务、辅导和推动各店改善经营管理，并且相互督促、相互交流经验等。
    第二，建立了财务管理制度。财务管理制度的主要内容是：实行收支预决算制度。店内每月开支要由资方编造预算，经过劳资协商及基层粮店管理小组协商通过，才能按预算支付费用，月终编报决算；实行现金管理。各店除必要的备用现金外，多余现金要存入银行。贯彻实行财务管理制度以后，各店经济账目完全公开了，企业的流动资金和盈余都加以管理，有效地防止了资本家的抽逃资金活动，初步纠正了不合理的开支，部分店还改变了家店不分的情况。职工对建立财务制度普遍感到满意。资本家也认为现金管理是“利己利国，一举两得”。从实行财务管理制度的初步情况可以看出：要有效地改善代销店的经营管理，改造资本家唯利是图的思想，建立财务管理制度，是一个重要步骤。
    第三，调整供应网，组织小店合并。私营米店在改为代销店的时候，有一千四百九十八家。经过合并，至九月底止，只有一千零三十二家了。合并和调整供应网的原则是：既要有利于粮食计划供应，不影响消费者购买的便利；又要有利于对资本主义零售商改造政策的贯彻执行。所以必须加强教育，充分协商，在自愿的基础上进行。合并中，为了解决职工劳逸不均和监督力量不平衡的现象，职工多由国家粮食部门统一调配，资方实职人员则都随店合并，参加一定工作的资方家属，一般也都适当照顾，对丧失工作能力的资方，由子女代替，对合并后家庭生活有困难者，也予适当贴补，其他对生财资金等问题也做了比较适当的处理。通过合并，原来家店不分的也自然分开了，因而开支也就比较合理了。有的资方反映：“合并有五好：第一可以发挥潜力，做好计划供应；第二可以节约开支；第三可以建立制度；第四工作有纪律，可以轮流休息；第五对个人改造也有好处。”但是也有个别地区在组织合并的时候，对居民购买便利的原则掌握不严，合并过多，造成居民购买不便。所以组织并店，必须有全面的规划，有组织地进行，才能使供应网的分布更趋于合理。
    随着企业改造工作的进行，同时也注意了改造资本家思想的工作。主要是：经常举行资本家会议，对资本家进行思想、政策教育，布置任务，进行检查总结。发现代销店有违法事件，也有重点地组织同地区的资本家进行座谈讨论，揭发批判，以提高大家的爱国守法观念。对在代销工作中表现较好的资本家，也经常给予表扬和鼓励，为大家指出方向和前途。这种双重改造工作的逐步开展，不仅逐步地改造了企业，同时也初步地改造了资本家本人。目前，私营粮店严重的掺杂、以次充好、挪用粮食、粮款等违法行为已经基本消灭，短秤，抽逃资金，扩大开支等现象也大为减少。绝大部分店已能做到依法、按期交纳国税。许多资本家参加了实际劳动，愿意在实际劳动中改造不劳而获的思想。过去米店资本家约有一半以上不过问店务或不参加实际工作，现在除个别年老体衰的以外，一般都已分工担任了实际工作或管理小组等社会活动，挂名拿干薪不做事的现象已基本消除。代销初期，部分资本家对自己前途的认识还是模糊的。经过安排、教育和逐步改造，现在，大部分资本家已经认清自己的前途，愿意在实际工作中进行改造。
    现在，上海粮食代销店的现状是：改造工作虽然获得很大成绩，但是由于生产关系没有根本改变，职工群众的积极性仍然受到限制。尤其小店、家庭店占很大比重，人手少，设备简陋，缺乏职工监督力量，其分散落后的经营状态，还不能适应粮食定量供应制度的要求。商业网的分布，也还不够合理，各店的职工特别是骨干力量也不能完全按照供应和管理的需要有计划地合理地统一调整，从业人员中工资的不合理情况仍然相当严重，未能根据按劳取酬的原则予以必要的调整。另一方面，资本主义经营作风还没有完全改变，仍有少数违法行为发生。这说明不彻底改变生产关系，这些问题也就不能根本解决，也就不能和今后经济形势的发展相适应。为适应今后经济建设形势的发展，保证粮食统购统销政策的彻底贯彻执行，把私营粮食零售商在一定时期内全部改造成为社会主义的商业，已经成为当前国家粮食工作的一项突出的任务了。
