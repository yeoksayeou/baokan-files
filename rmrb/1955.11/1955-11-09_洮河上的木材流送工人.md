    Timber Rafting Workers on the Tao River
    Yan Shugui
    From Shuangcha in the upper reaches of the Tao River, through Min County, Huichuan, Lintao, Guangtong, Dongxiang and other counties, and then into the Yellow River to Lanzhou, more than a thousand rafting workers are busily transporting timber on this thousand-mile river to support national industrial construction. The rafting workers steer rafts made of timber, wielding oars, and using their years of accumulated experience, bravely and skillfully avoid reefs, rocky mountains, and dangerous shoals, cutting through wind and waves, and speeding through the rapids. The gorge workers standing on the rafts, holding grappling hooks, constantly push stranded timber into the center of the river channel, allowing it to continue downstream. Sometimes thousands of logs are stuck in the gorge entrance, unable to move forward. They jump onto the pile of timber, skillfully pulling out one or two logs, and the timber pile breaks apart, slowly opening up the passage. The water salvage workers, sitting on sheepskin rafts, patrol and search for the released timber. As soon as they spot timber, they quickly paddle over, using the strength of their left leg and left foot to easily pull three or four large logs to the shore.
    The Tao River Forest Area in the upper reaches of the Tao River and the Yemu River Forest Area in the middle reaches are among the excellent forest areas in Gansu Province. They produce a large amount of high-quality timber such as spruce, fir, pine, and birch. The workers responsible for transportation on the Tao River are transporting the timber from the forest area to Lanzhou by waterway. Since liberation, they have transported hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of timber to Lanzhou.
    Using the Tao River to float timber began decades ago. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionary warlords and unscrupulous merchants dominated river transportation. They used foremen to control the workers, disregarded their lives, paid only meager wages, and carried out various kinds of exploitation and extortion. In addition, the Tao River was rapid with large whirlpools, narrow gorges, and many hidden reefs and rocks. To maintain a minimum standard of living, the transport workers risked great danger to float timber, and often suffered misfortune. Once, a raft hit a reef and all fifteen people on board perished. After liberation, in order to ensure the safety of workers floating timber, the Party and the People's Government first vigorously carried out the work of blasting and repairing the river channel. Over the years, they have successively blasted away hidden reefs and rocks such as the Immortal Cave, Pile Stone, Dragon King Pit, Second General Platform, Baby Mouth, and Eighteen Ridges in dangerous places such as Yehu Bridge, Jiudian Gorge, Heidian Gorge, Niubi Gorge, and Zhulama Gorge. They have also built large dams at Er Caokou and Erjiantan, two places with large backwaters, to allow timber to pass smoothly and reduce accidents. On the steep banks of the gorge, they have also built eighty li of pedestrian roads and two li of trestle roads to ensure the safety of workers coming and going. Safety signs have been erected in the more dangerous places on the river channel. In addition, workers have been issued many life-saving appliances, such as life buoys, life belts, and sheepskin tires. In the event of danger, workers can rely on these things to swim out of the river. Secondly, there have been major improvements in labor organization and timber rafting methods. Before liberation, workers had to transport timber all the way to Lanzhou, which took a long time. They could not get proper rest and often slept in the barren mountains and wild fields, and even eating was a problem. Now the entire river channel has been divided into ten sections, and workers are responsible for each section. After the timber is transported a certain distance, the next section takes over. In this way, after the work area is fixed, both work and life are normal. A major improvement in timber rafting methods is to lengthen the gorge entrance, and to float the timber one by one downstream in places where rafts were used to float timber in the gorge before liberation. After the timber comes out of the gorge, it is salvaged and reassembled into rafts to float downstream, which reduces the risk of the rafts hitting reefs and prevents accidents.
    Under the care and education of the Party, the workers' class consciousness has been raised. Under the slogan of supporting industrial construction, they have displayed a high degree of labor enthusiasm. In the past few years, they have put forward the "driving the sheep" work method to accelerate the speed of timber rafting, shortening the journey from Lintao to Lanzhou from thirteen days to five days. They also put forward the "pulling the filter" method and the "pulling the door" method to reduce timber losses. In the past few years, labor productivity has continued to increase. Taking 1951 as 100, last year increased by more than 120 percent compared with 1951, and this year it has increased a lot compared with last year, an increase of 159 percent compared with 1951. In the past few years, many model workers who cherish national timber have emerged. In July of this year, a major flood occurred on the Tao River, and seven rafts were washed away by the water. After receiving the news, the workers of the second rafting team did not hesitate at all, each holding a sheepskin tire, and immediately jumped into the flood. After their intense struggle, they finally brought the timber safely to the shore. The river channel opened later this year, but thanks to the hard work of the workers, the plan was completed with an over-fulfillment of 9.5 percent; and it was about a month earlier than in previous years.

    洮河上的木材流送工人
    燕树桂
    从洮河上游的双岔向下，经岷县、会川、临洮、广通、东乡等县，然后再转入黄河到兰州，在这一千多里河道上的一千多个流送工人，为了支援国家工业建设，正忙碌地运输木材。流送工人驾驶木材编成的筏子，操着木桨，根据多年积累起来的经验，勇敢而机智地避过暗礁、岩山和险滩，穿破风浪，在急流中飞驰。站在木排上的捻峡工人，拿着搭钩，不断地把搁浅了的木材推到河道的中心，让它继续顺流而下。有时几千根木材插在峡口，拥塞不前，他们便跃上这个木材堆，巧妙地抽动其中一两根，木材堆便会分解开来，慢慢地开出港口。水上的捞材工人，坐着羊皮筏子，巡回搜索放下来的木材。一发现木材，便急速划去，运用左腿和左脚的力量，轻便地牵引三、四根很大的木料靠到岸边。
    洮河上游的洮河林区和中游的冶木河林区，是甘肃省优良林区之一。这里出产大量的云杉、冷杉、松、桦等质量良好的木材。负担洮河运输的工人，便是把林区的木材由水道运到兰州。自解放以来，他们已为兰州运输了几十万立方公尺的木材。
    利用洮河河水流送木材，早在几十年以前就开始了。在解放前，国民党反动军阀和奸商霸占河道运输，他们利用把头控制工人，不关心工人死活，只付给微薄的工资，还要进行多方面的剥削敲榨。加上洮河水急漩涡大，峡窄暗礁岩石多，运输工人为了维持最低限度的生活，冒着很大危险流放木材，经常遭到不幸。有一次一个筏子触到暗礁，十五个人全部丧命。解放后，党和人民政府为了保证工人流送木材的安全，首先，大力进行了炸修河道的工作。几年来先后在野虎桥、九奠峡、黑奠峡、牛鼻峡、朱啦嘛峡等险要的地方，炸掉了神仙洞、桩桩石、龙王坑、二将台、娃娃嘴、十八坎等暗礁和岩石，在二槽口、二尖滩两个回水很大的地方修建了很大的拦河坝工程，使木材得以顺利地通行，减少了事故。在峡谷的陡岸上，还修建了八十华里长的人行道和两华里长的栈道，保证了工人来往行走的安全。河道上比较危险的地方，树立了安全标志。此外，还发给工人许多救生用具，如救生圈、救生带、羊皮胎等。万一发生危险，工人可以依靠这些东西从河里游出来。其次，在劳动组织方面和流送木材方法方面有了重大的改进。解放前工人流送木材，一直要运输到兰州，中间时间很长，得不到应有的休息，而且经常露宿在荒山野地，吃饭也成问题。现在整个河道改为十个段，工人分段负责。木材运输到一定距离，由下一段接班。这样，工作地区固定后，工作和生活都很正常。流送木材方法方面的一项重大改进，是把峡口延长，把解放前一些用筏子在峡内流送木材的地方都改为一根一根地向下贯。等到木材出了峡口再捞上来重新编成筏子向下划，这样就减少了筏子触礁的危险，防止了事故的发生。
    在党的关怀和教育下，工人的阶级觉悟提高了。他们在支援工业建设的口号下，发挥了高度的劳动热情。几年当中，他们提出了加速木材流送速度的“大赶羊”的工作方法，使临洮到兰州十三天的路程，缩短为五天。他们还提出了减少木材损失的“拉滤子”的方法和“拉门子”的方法。几年来劳动生产率不断提高，以一九五一年为一百，去年比一九五一年提高百分之一百二十多，今年又比去年提高很多，较一九五一年提高了百分之一百五十九。几年当中，工人当中涌现出许多爱护国家木材的模范人物。今年七月，洮河发生了一次很大的洪水，有七个木筏子被水卷走。流送第二队的工人得到消息后，丝毫没有犹豫，一人抱着一个羊皮胎，马上跳到洪水里。经过他们紧张的搏斗，终于使这些木材安然靠了岸。今年河道开放的时间比较晚一些，但是在工人辛勤劳动下，超额百分之九点五的成绩完成了放运计划；并且较往年提早了约一个月的时间。
