The China Writers Association Holds Symposium on Children's Literature

　　The China Writers Association invited writers in Beijing and children's literature workers to hold a symposium on children's literature from the 24th to the 26th.

　　In addition to writers, more than 50 people attended the symposium, including amateur children's literature creators, editors of children's literature publications, instructors of the Chinese Young Pioneers, and primary school teachers.

　　At the symposium, Liu Baiyu, director of the Creation Committee of the China Writers Association, explained the instructions issued by the Writers Association on the development of children's literature and the creation plan for children's literature. In his speech, Liu Baiyu focused on cultivating children with the spirit of communism, the moral character of children's literature writers, and the techniques of children's literature creation. Liu Baiyu said: This is the first time we have held a children's literature symposium of this scale. We hope that similar meetings can be held in various places to promote the creation of children's literature. He said: We must promote children's literature creation in a long-term, permanent, and resolute manner, making it a brilliant, moving, and most powerful part of Chinese literature.

　　Children's literature writer Zhang Tianyi made a speech at the meeting on the issue of writers delving into the lives of children. He hoped that children's literature writers, in the process of delving into life and creation, should be like children's parents, like teachers and instructors, and like children's close friends. He said: More importantly, writers must be thinkers and educators, especially communist fighters.

　　Representatives from the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the China Youth Publishing House introduced the lives and studies of children, the activities of the Young Pioneers, and the reflections and opinions of readers on children's literature works. At the symposium, a written speech by writer Gao Shiqi on children's science reading materials was also read.

　　Professional and amateur children's literature writers stated in their speeches that they will definitely delve into life in the future and make their best efforts to change the current situation of the lack of children's literature reading materials, and create rich and educational spiritual food for children. Everyone also pointed out in their speeches that the themes of children's literature should be broad, and special attention should be paid to reflecting real life. At the meeting, everyone also put forward many valuable suggestions and requirements on preschool children's reading materials, character creation and language in children's literature reading materials, and the publication and distribution of children's literature reading materials.

　　The China Writers Association plans to continue to hold such symposiums in the future to discuss the creation of children's literature. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　中国作家协会召开少年儿童文学座谈会
    中国作家协会从二十四到二十六日邀请在北京的作家和少年儿童文学工作者召开少年儿童文学座谈会。
    参加座谈会的除作家外，还有业余的少年儿童文学创作者、少年儿童文学读物的编辑、中国少年先锋队的辅导员，以及小学教师等共五十多人。
    在座谈会上，中国作家协会创作委员会主任刘白羽就作家协会最近发出的关于发展少年儿童文学的指示和少年儿童文学创作计划作了说明。刘白羽在发言中着重谈到用共产主义精神培养少年儿童，少年儿童文学作家的品德修养，以及少年儿童文学创作的技巧问题。刘白羽说：我们还是第一次召开这样规模的少年儿童文学座谈会，希望各地也能召开这样的会，来推动少年儿童文学创作。他说：我们要长期地、永远地、坚决地把少年儿童文学创作推向前进，使它成为中国文学中精采、动人、最有力量的一部分。
    少年儿童文学作家张天翼在会上作了关于作家深入少年儿童生活问题的发言。他希望少年儿童文学作家在深入生活和创作过程中，应该像孩子的父母一样，像教师和辅导员一样，像孩子的知心朋友一样。他说：更重要的是，作家必须是思想家、教育家，尤其应当是共产主义的战士。
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会和中国青年出版社的代表在会上介绍了少年儿童的生活、学习和少年先锋队的活动情况，以及读者对少年儿童文学作品的反映和意见。座谈会上还宣读了作家高士其关于少年儿童科学读物的书面发言。
    专业的和业余的少年儿童文学作家在发言中表示，今后一定深入生活，用最大的努力来改变少年儿童文学读物缺乏的现状，给孩子们创作出丰富的有教育意义的精神食粮。大家在发言中还指出，少年儿童文学的题材应当广泛，特别应当注意反映现实生活。会上，大家还就学龄前儿童读物、少年儿童文学读物的人物创作和语言、少年儿童文学读物的出版发行等问题，提出许多宝贵的建议和要求。
    中国作家协会今后还准备继续召开这样的座谈会，讨论少年儿童文学创作问题。　（新华社）
