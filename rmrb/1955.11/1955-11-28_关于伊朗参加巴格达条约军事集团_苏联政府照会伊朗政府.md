Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received Mr. Aitesami, the Iranian Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, on November 26th and handed him the Soviet government's note regarding Iran's participation in the Baghdad Pact countries' military bloc. This note is also the Soviet government's response to a memorandum from the Iranian government, which was handed to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on October 17th by Mr. Aitesami, the Iranian Chargé d'Affaires in Moscow, in response to the Soviet government's statement of October 12th.

The Iranian government's above-mentioned memorandum and the Soviet government's note to the Iranian government are as follows:

　　Iranian Government's Memorandum to the Soviet Government, October 17, 1955

As the competent authorities of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics know, the Soviet Ambassador in Tehran has repeatedly been notified orally and in writing that the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Iran, having the responsibility of maintaining independence and defending the territory of its country and exercising its own sovereignty, will take any steps it deems appropriate and necessary to achieve this purpose; therefore, it is quite natural for the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Iran to participate in the Treaty of Common Cooperation concluded by Iraq and Turkey, which has already come into effect within the framework of the United Nations Charter, and its purpose is only to strengthen the foundations of peace and security in the Middle East region and the rest of the world.

The conclusion drawn by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics regarding the treaty concluded between the governments of Iraq and Turkey, and the fact that this treaty is regarded as a military bloc in the Near and Middle East and a tool of certain aggressive forces that are not concerned with strengthening world peace but pursue the goal of maintaining and restoring colonial policies, is quite surprising, because the above-mentioned treaty, in which the British government and the Pakistani government have already participated, is a treaty concluded by several member states of the United Nations out of their free will and exercising their sovereignty to enable them to make decisions they deem appropriate for self-defense, and its purpose is to maintain peace and legitimate defense, and all of this, in addition to being indisputable principles of international law and the basic rights of people and society, has also been stated in the United Nations Charter.

The Iranian Government of His Imperial Majesty's serious struggle on an international scale to eradicate colonialism -- the eradication of colonialism is the foundation of its policy -- makes the idea of restoring any kind of colonial policy in the world inappropriate. Therefore, the interpretation made by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics regarding the above-mentioned treaty is unjust and cannot be established under any circumstances. Such an interpretation made by the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is unexpected, especially since the Soviet Union is also a member of the United Nations organization and assumes the same obligations and responsibilities, it is fully aware of the provisions of the Charter, and it itself has taken similar steps.

In view of the above explanations, noting that respecting international obligations is the foundation of the policy of the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Iran, participation in the Iraqi-Turkish common cooperation treaty in no way harms the friendly and good-neighborly relations with the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which is a matter that the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Iran pays special attention to and is particularly concerned about, as confirmed by the recent measures taken to resolve border and financial issues, and Iran's participation in this treaty does not contradict the meaning of the current treaty between the two governments.

　　Soviet Government's Note to the Iranian Government, November 26, 1955

Regarding the Iranian government's reply of October 17 to the Soviet government's statement of October 12, the Soviet government deems it necessary to state the following:

    I. The Soviet government has to note with regret that, despite repeated friendly warnings from the Soviet Union, the Iranian government has proceeded with activities to involve Iran in the Middle East military group called the Baghdad Group – an alliance of Turkey, Iraq and Pakistan, including Great Britain.

    As a result, Iran has become a member of a military group which is certainly a tool of aggressive circles. While it may seem strange, by joining this group, Iran has linked its policies to the interests of foreign powers which have nothing in common with Iran, and these foreign powers are striving to maintain and restore colonial subjugation of countries in the region.

    In this regard, the Soviet government considers it necessary to reiterate that Iran's participation in the Baghdad military group is contrary to the interests of strengthening peace and security in the Middle East, and is contrary to the good-neighborly relations between Iran and the Soviet Union and the well-known treaty obligations of Iran.

    II. The Iranian government, in its reply of October 17, attempted to justify Iran's participation in the Baghdad Group by mentioning the so-called defensive purposes of this military alliance.

    However, such a statement is not in line with the actual situation.

    It is well known that Article 1 of the Baghdad Treaty stipulates that the member states of the treaty will carry out military cooperation, and the measures for implementing this cooperation will be stipulated by special agreements. What the consequences of this cooperation will be can be seen from the following fact: Iraq, one of the member states of the Baghdad Treaty, has simultaneously signed a special agreement with Great Britain, another stronger member state of this treaty, which grants Great Britain the right to use Iraqi air force bases, its airports and territory for the needs of the British army, while the Iraqi army is placed under the control of British instructors and advisors.

    The nature of the obligations of the Middle Eastern members of the Baghdad Group can also be seen from the content of a special protocol published in foreign newspapers as an annex to the Baghdad Treaty. This protocol stipulates that the contracting parties undertake, under certain conditions, the obligation to provide the other party with its territory, airports and war supplies. News from American, British and Turkish newspapers indicates that, according to Western military plans, the Turkish army, which is responsible for launching an "offensive" against the Caucasus, is to enter Iran and occupy Iranian Azerbaijan and Kurdistan.

    Turkish Prime Minister Mr. Menderes said at the recent congress of the Turkish Democratic Party that as a result of Turkey's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the signing of the Baghdad Treaty – which Iran has now joined – "a consolidated northern front has been established". This statement also shows the aggressive tendency of the Baghdad military group. The statements of American official spokesmen also prove this point, they have repeatedly emphasized that the Baghdad military treaty and Iran's participation are stipulated in the American military plan regarding the establishment of the so-called "Northern Tier" defense circle of Middle Eastern countries. The speeches of the heads of government and ministers of the participating countries of the Baghdad Group at the first meeting of the Baghdad Treaty Council also confirmed this point. This meeting has just ended (November 21 to 22), and American representatives participated in this meeting as observers.

    Regarding this aspect, the following fact should also be mentioned: the amount of munitions and military supplies that the United States and Great Britain are supplying to the Baghdad Group countries is increasing day by day, and these supplies are given on the condition of clear military and political obligations that will complicate the situation in the Near East and the Middle East and will endanger the security and national independence of the countries in the above-mentioned regions.

    Therefore, it is not accidental that the Arab countries and other countries in this region that are adjacent to the member states of the Baghdad Group have adopted a negative attitude towards the establishment of the Baghdad Group, believing that it is a direct threat to their vital interests.

    At the same time, air force and naval bases are being built more intensively on the territory of Turkey, one of the active participants of the Baghdad Treaty, and other measures to turn Turkey into a strategic bridgehead pointing to peace-loving neighboring countries are being implemented under the guidance of the United States.

    The true nature of the Baghdad military group can also be seen from the fact that Turkey and Great Britain, members of the Baghdad Group, belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military group, while Pakistan and Great Britain are members of another military-political group in Southeast Asia – the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. However, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an aggressive military group pointing to the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries, and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool of colonial countries, and everyone knows that the Bandung Asian-African Conference condemned any form of colonialism.

    As a link between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, the Baghdad Group not only threatens peace in the Middle East, but also threatens peace outside this region. Moreover, the connection between the Baghdad Group and the above-mentioned military groups has the possibility of involving the Middle Eastern countries in armed conflicts that may occur in the rest of the world.

    Therefore, the establishment of the Baghdad Group and Iran's participation were not prompted by defensive needs, but serve the purposes of certain countries that are trying to turn the Near East and the Middle East countries -- including Iran -- into their military bases, thereby ensuring the stationing of foreign armed forces on these countries' territories and the establishment of their military bases. At the same time, everyone knows that no one has ever threatened or is threatening Iran, and if there is indeed a danger to Iran's security and independence, this danger comes primarily from those countries that are establishing aggressive groups pointing to other countries.

    III. The Iranian government's statement that the struggle to eradicate colonialism is the foundation of its policy, and that this struggle makes the idea of restoring any form of colonialism in the world inappropriate, is inconsistent with the above-mentioned facts and the fact that colonial countries are actually trying to maintain and restore colonial enslavement of economically backward countries. The joining of these countries into the above-mentioned groups will make them lose their independence and increase their economic and political dependence on foreign countries.

    It is not accidental that a large number of foreign military advisors have poured into these countries in the process of these countries preparing to join the military groups, and have infiltrated important positions in the military and government institutions, thereby gradually making the armies of these countries lose their national character.

    At the same time, many so-called "civilian advisors" are being sent to these countries, and they are grasping the guidance of these countries' economies in various ways, and are assisting foreign capital in seizing their natural resources, mainly their oil resources.

    The arms race and military construction carried out according to these plans and for the purposes of the above-mentioned groups are a heavy burden on the budgets and economies of the member states of these groups, forcing them to borrow money and loans from foreign countries, thereby increasing their dependence on foreign countries and lowering the living standards of the people. All of this applies to the Baghdad Group countries, including Iran, and this cannot but violate the national interests and aspirations of the Middle Eastern countries – the member states of the Baghdad Group.

    IV. Contrary to the Iranian government's statement, the establishment of the Baghdad military group has nothing in common with the purposes of the United Nations, and the fact that the Iranian government mentioned that both the Soviet Union and Iran are members of the United Nations cannot be used as an excuse for Iran's participation in the above-mentioned group, because the purpose of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, and to develop friendly relations between nations, while the purpose of the establishment of the Baghdad Group is exactly the opposite.

    V. The Soviet government notes that the Iranian government's statement that it respects its international obligations is inconsistent with the Iranian government's actions. The Iranian government has abandoned its obligations under Article 3 of the Soviet-Iranian Guarantee and Neutrality Treaty of October 1, 1947, and has decided to join the Baghdad Group, which is aimed at the Soviet Union. Article 3 of the above-mentioned Soviet-Iranian Treaty states:

    "Each of the contracting parties guarantees not to participate, de facto or de jure, in political alliances or agreements that endanger the security of the other contracting party on land or at sea, and that endanger its integrity, independence or its sovereignty."

    The Iranian government's claim that participation in the Baghdad Group is its sovereignty cannot be used as an excuse to violate Iran's international obligations. The Soviet Union strictly adheres to the principles of its policy in its relations with other countries. It has always respected Iran's sovereignty and independence, as well as Iran's right to decide its own internal affairs and foreign policy. However, it goes without saying that both sides should abide by the obligations automatically undertaken under the Soviet-Iranian Treaty.

    The Soviet government points out that Iran's participation in the Baghdad Group will seriously damage the relations between the Soviet Union and Iran, especially at a time when the efforts of the Soviet Union and other countries have led to positive achievements in easing international tensions and building trust among countries, and the Soviet Union has taken a series of measures to strengthen and develop good-neighborly relations with Iran.

    The situation caused by Iran's joining the Baghdad aggressive group is full of threats to the Soviet border. In view of this, the Soviet government cannot continue to be indifferent to Iran's participation in the Baghdad Treaty.

    In view of the above points, the Soviet government cannot consider the Iranian government's reply to be satisfactory. The Soviet government reiterates its statement of October 12 and believes that the Iranian government should be fully responsible for the possible consequences caused by the Iranian government's decision to join the Baghdad military group.

　　Moscow, November 26, 1955

Mr. Aitesami said that he would immediately forward the above note to the Iranian government.

    关于伊朗参加巴格达条约军事集团
　  苏联政府照会伊朗政府
    新华社讯塔斯社莫斯科二十六日电：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在十一月二十六日接见了伊朗驻莫斯科临时代办艾特萨米先生，并且把苏联政府关于伊朗参加巴格达集团国家军事集团一事的照会交给他。这份照会同时也是苏联政府对伊朗政府的一份备忘录的答复，那份备忘录是伊朗驻莫斯科临时代办艾特萨米先生在十月十七日交给苏联外交部的，是对苏联政府十月十二日的声明的答复。
    伊朗政府的上述备忘录和苏联政府致伊朗政府的照会如下：
　  伊朗政府一九五五年十月十七日致苏联政府的备忘录
    像苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的主管机构所知道的，苏联大使先生在德黑兰曾一再得到口头的和书面的通知说，伊朗国王陛下政府由于有维护独立和保卫它的国家的疆土的责任、并且行使它自己的主权，将采取它认为适宜的和必要的任何步骤来达到这个目的；因此，伊朗国王陛下政府参加伊拉克和土耳其缔结的共同合作条约是十分自然的，这个条约已经在联合国宪章的范围内生效，它的目的只是加强中东地区以及世界其余地区的和平和安全的基础。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府就伊拉克和土耳其两国政府缔结的条约得出的结论，以及这个条约被当作中近东的一个军事集团和某些不关心加强世界和平、而追求维持和恢复殖民政策的目的的侵略势力的工具这一事实，十分令人吃惊，因为已有英国政府和巴基斯坦政府参加的上述条约是几个联合国会员国出于它们的自由意志和行使它们的主权使它们能够作出它们认为合宜的决定来进行自卫而缔结的条约，它的目的是保持和平和合法的防御，并且，这一切除了是无可争辩的国际法原则以及人和社会的基本权利外，在联合国宪章中也已经有所说明。
    伊朗国王陛下政府在国际规模上进行的根除殖民主义——根除殖民主义是它的政策的基础——的严重斗争使得在世界上恢复任何种类的殖民政策的想法都成为不适当。因此，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府对于上述条约所作的解释是不公正的，而且无论如何是不能成立的。苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府方面所作的这样一种解释是出乎意料的，好在苏联也是联合国组织的一个会员国并且承担着同样的义务和责任，它是充分知道宪章的规定，而且它自己已经采取了类似的步骤。
    鉴于以上解释，注意到尊重国际义务是伊朗国王陛下政府政策的基础，参加伊拉克和土耳其共同合作条约无论如何都不损害同苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟政府的友好和善邻关系，这种关系是伊朗国王陛下政府所特别注意和特别关心的问题，最近为解决边界和财政问题所采取的措施就证实了这一点，而且伊朗参加这个条约同两国政府之间的现行条约的意义毫不矛盾。
　  苏联政府一九五五年十一月二十六日致伊朗政府的照会
    关于伊朗政府十月十七日对苏联政府十月十二日的声明的答复，苏联政府认为有必要声明如下：
    一、苏联政府不得不遗憾地注意到，尽管苏联一再提出了友好的警告，伊朗政府还是进行了使伊朗参加包括英国在内的被称为巴格达集团的中近东军事集团——土耳其、伊拉克和巴基斯坦联盟的活动。
    其结果，伊朗已经成为一个军事集团的成员，这个集团是肯定的侵略集团的工具。虽然看来是奇怪的，但是由于参加了这个集团，伊朗已经使它的政策同和伊朗没有丝毫共同之处的外国势力的利益联系起来，而这些外国势力是竭力要使这个地区的国家保持和恢复殖民地附属地位的。
  关于这一点，苏联政府认为有必要重申：伊朗参加巴格达军事集团是和加强中近东地区的和平和安全的利益相抵触的，而且是同伊朗和苏联的善邻关系以及同人所共知的伊朗的条约义务相违背的。
    二、伊朗政府在十月十七日的答复中提到这个军事联盟的所谓防御目的，企图为伊朗参加巴格达集团辩护。
    但是，这样的提法是不符合实际情况的。
    大家知道，巴格达条约第一条规定，条约成员国之间进行军事合作，而实行这种合作的措施将由特别的协定加以规定。这种合作会引起什么结果可以从下面这个事实中看出来：巴格达条约成员国之一伊拉克同时同这个条约的另一个更强大的成员国英国签订了一项特别协定，这个协定给与英国使用伊拉克的空军基地、它的飞机场和领土的权利，以供英国军队的需要，而伊拉克的军队则被置于英国教官和顾问的控制之下。
    巴格达集团的中近东各成员国的义务的性质也可以从外国报纸发表的、作为巴格达条约的一个附件的特别议定书的内容中看出。这项议定书规定，缔约各方在一定条件下承担为另一方提供它的领土、飞机场和战争供应品的义务。美国、英国和土耳其报纸的消息表明，根据西方国家军事计划担负了向高加索发动“进攻”的任务的土耳其军队要进入伊朗，并且占领伊朗阿塞拜疆和库尔德斯坦。
    土耳其总理曼德列斯先生在土耳其民主党最近的代表大会上说，土耳其参加北大西洋集团和签订巴格达条约——伊朗现在已经参加这个条约——的结果，“已经建立了一个巩固的北部战线”。这番话也表明了巴格达军事集团的侵略倾向。美国官方发言人的言论也证明了这一点，他们一再强调说，巴格达军事条约和伊朗的参加是美国关于建立中东国家的所谓“北层”防御圈的军事计划中所规定的。巴格达集团各参加国的政府首脑和部长们在巴格达条约理事会第一次会议上的发言也证实了这一点。这次会议刚刚结束（十一月二十一日到二十二日），美国代表们以观察员的身份参加了这次会议。
    关于这方面，也应当提一下以下的事实：美国和英国供给巴格达集团国家的军火和军事供应品的数量正在日益增加，而给予这些供应品是以将促使近东和中东的局势更加复杂和将危害上述地区各国的安全和民族独立的明确的军事和政治义务为条件的。
    因此，阿拉伯国家和同巴格达集团各成员国毗邻的这个地区的其他国家对巴格达集团的建立采取消极的态度，认为它是对它们的切身利益的直接威胁，这并不是偶然的。
    同时，巴格达条约的积极参加者之一的土耳其领土上正在加紧建筑空军和海军基地，而且把土耳其变成一个矛头指向爱好和平的邻国的战略桥头堡的其他措施也在美国的指导下加以实施。
    巴格达军事集团的真正性质也可以从这一事实看出来：巴格达集团的成员土耳其和英国是属于北大西洋公约组织军事集团的，而巴基斯坦和英国则是另一个在东南亚的军事政治集团——所谓东南亚条约组织的成员国。然而，北大西洋公约组织是一个矛头指向苏联和其他爱好和平的国家的侵略性军事集团，而东南亚条约组织是殖民国家的工具，大家知道，万隆亚非会议谴责了任何形式的殖民主义。
    巴格达集团作为北大西洋公约组织和东南亚条约组织之间的联系环节，不仅威胁着中近东的和平，而且也威胁着这个地区以外的地方的和平。而且，巴格达集团同上述军事集团的联系，有使中近东国家卷入可能在世界其余部分发生的武装冲突的可能。
    因此，巴格达集团的建立和伊朗的加入不是由防御的需要而促成的，而是为某些国家的目的服务的，这些国家正在企图把近东和中东国家——包括伊朗——变成它们的军事基地，从而保证在这些国家的领土上驻扎外国武装部队和建立它们的军事基地。同时，大家都清楚知道，没有人曾经威胁或是正在威胁着伊朗，并且如果的确存在着对伊朗的安全和独立的危险的话，这种危险首先是来自正在建立矛头指向其他国家的侵略集团的那些国家。
    三、伊朗政府声明说，根除殖民主义的斗争是它的政策的基础，并且这个斗争使得在世界上恢复任何形式的殖民主义的想法成为不适当，这种说法和上述事实以及殖民国家实际上在企图保持和恢复对在经济上落后的国家的殖民主义奴役的这个事实是相抵触的。这些国家加入上述各集团，将使它们丧失它们的独立，增加它们对外国的经济和政治上的依赖。
    在这些国家准备加入各军事集团的过程中，已经有大批的外国军事顾问涌入这些国家，渗入了军事和政府机构中的重要地位，从而使这些国家的军队逐渐丧失它们的民族性，这并不是偶然的事情。
    与此同时，许多所谓“文职顾问”正被派往这些国家，他们以各种方法掌握了这些国家的经济的指导权，并且协助外国资本攫取它们的天然资源，主要是它们的石油资源。
    根据这些计划和为了上述集团的目的而进行的军备竞赛和军事建设是这种集团的成员国的预算和经济的沉重负担，迫使他们向外国借款和贷款，因而增加了它们依赖外国的程度，降低了人民的生活水平。所有这一切都适用于巴格达集团国家，包括伊朗在内，而这是不能不违反中近东国家——巴格达集团的成员国——的民族利益和愿望的。
    四、与伊朗政府的说法相反，建立巴格达军事集团跟联合国的宗旨毫无共同之处，而伊朗政府提到的苏联和伊朗都是联合国成员国这一事实并不能作为伊朗参加上述集团的借口，因为联合国的宗旨是保持国际和平和安全，发展国际的友好关系，而成立巴格达集团的目的却恰恰相反。
    五、苏联政府注意到，伊朗政府说它尊重它的国际义务的声明是和伊朗政府的行动不符合的，伊朗政府背弃了它根据一九四七年十月一日苏伊保证和中立条约第三条承担的义务，决定加入矛头指向苏联的巴格达集团。上述苏伊条约的第三条说：
  “缔约一方保证不在事实上或法律上参加在陆上或海上危害缔约另一方的安全，以及危害它的完整、独立或它的主权的政治联盟或协定。”
    伊朗政府说参加巴格达集团是它的主权，这种说法是不能作为破坏伊朗的国际义务的借口的。苏联严格遵守它在同其他国家的关系中的政策的原则，它一向是尊重伊朗的主权和独立以及伊朗自己决定它的内政和外交政策的权利的。但是，不用说，双方应该遵守根据苏伊条约自动承担的义务。
    苏联政府指出，伊朗的参加巴格达集团将严重地损害苏联和伊朗间的关系，特别是在苏联和其他一些国家的努力已经在缓和国际紧张局势和在各国间建立信任方面导致肯定的成就以及苏联已经采取一系列措施来加强和发展同伊朗的善邻关系这样一个时候。
    伊朗加入巴格达侵略集团所正在引起的局势充满着对苏联国境的威胁。鉴于这一点，苏联政府不能继续对伊朗参加巴格达条约一事漠不关心。
    鉴于上述各点，苏联政府不能认为伊朗政府的答复是令人满意的，苏联政府重申它在十月十二日的声明，认为由于伊朗政府决定加入巴格达军事集团所可能造成的后果完全应该由伊朗政府负责。
        一九五五年十一月二十六日于莫斯科
    艾特萨米先生说他将立即把上述照会转交给伊朗政府。
