　　Shooting Sports in the Soviet Union
　　By A.F. Kustov, Head of the Soviet Union Volunteer Association for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force Shooting Delegation

　　Sports and physical culture in the Soviet Union are one of the most important tools for carrying out communist education among the working people, improving their health, and strengthening their preparedness for peaceful construction work and defending the socialist motherland. The Communist Party and the Soviet government have shown great concern for the extensive development of sports and physical culture in the Soviet Union.

　　Shooting sports in the Soviet Union are one of the most popular and beloved sports among the working people, because this sport, which has great significance for national defense, can cultivate and enhance the excellent qualities of athletes—an indomitable will to win, determination, composure, and a high degree of discipline.

　　Before the revolution, there were also some skilled shooters in our country. However, in Tsarist Russia, shooting sports were only accessible to a limited number of people in the ruling class. After the Great October Socialist Revolution, shooting sports began to take on a different character, a truly mass, truly popular character.

　　In 1922, the first shooting groups began to be organized in our country. In these shooting groups, people not only studied weapons but also mastered accurate shooting techniques. Some such shooting groups were established in voluntary sports associations and factories. During this period, the Soviet Union began to establish national defense associations, which were merged in 1927 into the Union of Societies for Assisting Defense and Aviation-Chemical Construction – later this union was reorganized into the Volunteer Association for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force (DOSAAF). While strengthening activities to support national defense, DOSAAF extensively carried out the work of training young people to master the art of accurate shooting. In 1931, the Soviet Union issued a special badge to accurate shooters – "Voroshilov Shooter" (for which it was necessary to complete shooting events with small-bore rifles and military rifles).

　　The Communist Youth League organizations in factories and institutions put forward a task to the youth—mastering accurate shooting skills. The Soviet youth fulfilled this task with great patriotic enthusiasm. Before the start of the Great Patriotic War, DOSAAF trained millions of "Voroshilov Shooters." From these many people began to emerge some particularly accurate shooters, who later became athletes, national and world champions and record holders. During the Great Patriotic War, hundreds of thousands of shooting athletes became snipers, using their accurate shooting to kill German fascist aggressors. Many of them were awarded orders and medals by the Soviet government for their successful combat actions on the front lines and behind enemy lines.

　　In the post-war years, shooting sports in the Soviet Union became an even more mass sport, and Soviet shooting athletes achieved greater success in international competitions. These achievements did not come by themselves; their attainment was the result of persistent study and sports competitions, the study of the most appropriate training methods, the improvement of sports techniques, and the improvement of shooting weapons.

　　In 1923, the Soviet Union held the first All-Union Shooting Competition. At that time, the shooting skills of the athletes were not high. The best score for small-bore rifles was 163 rings (out of a possible 200). Now, as everyone knows, many shooters have hit 199 rings and 200 rings in this event.

　　The vigorously developing national industry has created the best sports small-bore weapons and combat weapons, and produces them in large quantities. This weapon enables Soviet athletes to achieve excellent results, while promoting the widespread development of our shooting sports. Workers in factories personally build shooting ranges for practice. At present, there are hundreds of such ranges and shooting grounds in our country, where shooting competitions are often held.

　　From 1935, Soviet shooting athletes began to participate in international shooting competitions. The shooting team of the Bauman "Voroshilov Shooter" Club in Moscow competed with the shooting team of the Portsmouth Club (USA) in 1935. This competition was conducted by correspondence in the presence of representatives of all parties. The Soviet team, consisting of ten people, won the 50-meter small-bore rifle event with 2,741 rings. The American shooters' score was 2,508 rings. During the period from 1935 to 1937, seven more competitions were held with American athletes, in five of which the Soviet athletes won.

　　In five years (1935 to 1939), our shooters participated annually in correspondence competitions organized by the Society of Miniature Rifle Clubs of Great Britain. In these five competitions, Soviet athletes also took the lead four times. In 1936, the shooter Alekseyev, who participated in these competitions, hit 400 rings (the full score) for the first time in the world in small-bore rifle shooting at a distance of 50 meters. After that, this kind of score appeared repeatedly.

　　In the post-war period, the Communist Party put forward a major task in sports work—to carry out mass sports activities throughout the country, improve sports skills, and on this basis, enable Soviet athletes to win world championships in the most important sports events.

　　Our shooting athletes, together with all Soviet athletes, are also fighting to break world records. In 1952, they won the championship at the 15th Olympic Games.

　　National records for various shooting events are increasing year by year. The international friendship shooting competitions held in Bulgaria (1950) and Romania (1952) played an important role in cultivating shooting athletes, improving shooting skills and results, and further consolidating the friendship between the athletes and people of our countries.

　　In 1954, our shooting athletes participated in the 36th World Shooting Championships and wrote a new glorious page in the history of the development of shooting sports. They won nine championships in fourteen events. Of the twenty-four world records created at last year's World Championships, nineteen belonged to Soviet athletes. Among the athletes who achieved outstanding results in these competitions were DOSAAF shooters Kalinichenko (world champion), Perebelin, and Zhigutov. They all participated in the 1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition now being held in Beijing.

　　Soviet women have also successfully mastered the art of shooting. The national records created by Soviet women in small-bore rifle shooting are no less than those of men: with a full score of 200 rings, prone—200 rings, kneeling—199 rings, standing—190 rings, and the total for the three positions is 583 rings.

　　At present, Soviet shooting athletes hold more than 50% of the world records. These achievements of our shooting athletes should first of all be attributed to the Party and the government, because they are always concerned about the development of sports and physical culture throughout the country.

　　In the Soviet Union, in order to assess the training level of athletes, a rigorous and unified sports grading system has been formulated, ranging from third-class shooters to master athletes. The titles of various athletes can only be awarded after completing various examination standards in competitions judged by qualified sports referees. In order to improve shooting indicators and enable shooting athletes themselves to be trained, shooting competitions are often held between the best shooting teams of various sports organizations and institutions, as well as between mixed shooting teams of various states, border regions, and republics on a regional basis.

　　At present, the largest mass organization in this regard is the above-mentioned DOSAAF, whose task is to fully develop shooting sports in the Soviet Union.

　　The members of this patriotic national defense organization form groups in factories, institutions, enterprises, collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations. They obtain the necessary teaching materials, build shooting ranges, and study weapons and master shooting techniques with the help of demobilized soldiers or young activists—social activists. All courses are conducted in spare time. DOSAAF committees in various districts regularly hold competitions between shooting teams from various enterprises and institutions, and organize mixed shooting teams from various districts, which then participate in state and republic shooting competitions. This organizational system of shooting sports enables young people to master the art of accurate shooting without leaving their studies or work.

　　The number of shooting athletes in our country is increasing year by year. Our shooting masters and record holders are not only willing to tell our youth about their skills and experience, but also willing to tell the youth of various fraternal countries.

　　The athletes of DOSAAF were very happy to accept the invitation from the Central National Defense Sports Club of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Beijing International Friendship Shooting Competition. Now, after arriving in the capital of the People's Republic of China, we have the opportunity to see with our own eyes how enthusiastically the millions of fraternal Chinese people are building their new, free, and happy lives. We have seen many new buildings in Beijing, which is the best indicator of the comprehensive upsurge of Chinese national culture and economy. Before coming to China, our shooting athletes knew very little about the sports activities of our Chinese friends, but we are convinced that our Chinese friends are working hard on many things. The Chinese government and the Chinese Communist Party are giving them great help. The excellent new shooting range, equipped with the latest technology, is a pleasant and unexpected gift for us. We have not seen such a shooting range in any European city. Our expectations were not wrong. The competition held in Beijing is indeed interesting and rich in content. It is educational for all participants, whether in terms of the organization of the competition or the shooting skills of individual athletes.

　　First of all, we are happy for the achievements of the hosts. From the first day of the competition, we have been observing with great interest the shooting skills achieved by our Chinese comrades in a very short period of time. We are sincerely pleased with the results of the ten Chinese women comrades who participated in the international competition for the first time. Nine of them exceeded the sports skill standards in our All-Union Unified Sports Grading System. The shooting team of the People's Republic of China, composed of five people, ranked third after the Soviet Union and Bulgaria. This shows the great strength hidden in the depths of the people, the talent of our Chinese friends, and their outstanding perseverance, which only began to be manifested after the victory of the people's democratic system in China.

　　At the competition in Beijing, we met the famous shooters from Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, whom we had met at the European Championships in Bucharest not long ago. We are also very happy to have met the representatives of the Asian People's Democratic countries, who are participating in international shooting sports competitions for the first time. The competition was conducted at a high level of sports skills by all participants. As I point out the achievements that have been made, I sincerely hope that the shooting athletes of all fraternal countries will further develop mass sports in their own countries, and hope that they will achieve new and higher sports results in international competitions.

　　In this competition, our Soviet athletes had the opportunity to learn many things from our Chinese friends, especially the organization of international competitions. This kind of organization guarantees the participants in the competition everything they need, including cultural rest. Despite some difficulties caused by the fact that our athletes do not understand Chinese, we, like the athletes of various fraternal people's democratic countries, have found ways to tell our Chinese comrades about our impressions and experience in sports work. Our athletes have received great attention in China, and they have felt the friendship of the fraternal Chinese people towards them everywhere. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our Chinese friends. In no international competition have we encountered such a sincere atmosphere of friendship, such unanimity of opinion and mutual assistance between athletes and leaders of sports delegations as we have encountered in this competition held in the capital of China. There is no doubt that this competition will further consolidate the friendship and mutual understanding between the people of the participating countries.

　　苏联的射击运动
　　苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会射击代表团团长　阿·弗·库斯托夫
    苏联的体育和运动是对劳动人民进行共产主义教育，增进他们的健康，加强他们对从事和平的建设性劳动和保卫社会主义祖国的准备的最重要的工具之一。共产党和苏联政府对苏联的体育和运动的广泛发展表现了巨大的关怀。
    苏联的射击运动是劳动人民的最普遍和最热爱的运动种类之一，因为这种对国防事业具有巨大意义的运动，可以形成和增进运动员的优秀品质——对取得胜利的刚毅不屈的意志，决心，沉着和高度的纪律性。
    在革命以前，我国也有一些熟练的射手。但是，在沙皇俄国，射击运动只是统治阶级中有限的一些人才能接近。在伟大十月社会主义革命以后，射击运动才开始具有另一种性质，具有真正群众性的、真正人民的性质。
    一九二二年我国开始组织了第一批射击小组，在这些射击小组里不仅从事研究武器，而且要掌握准确的射击技术。在一些志愿体育协会和工厂中建立了一些这样的射击小组。在这个时期，苏联开始建立国防协会，这些国防协会在一九二七年合并为支援国防和航空化学工业协会联合会——后来这个联合会改组为苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会。支援国防和航空化学工业协会联合会在加强支援国防的活动时，广泛地开展了训练青年掌握准确的射击艺术的工作。一九三一年苏联为准确的射手们颁发特别徽章——“伏罗希洛夫射手”（为此必须完成小口径步枪和军用步枪的射击项目）。
    工厂和机关的共青团组织在青年面前提出一项任务——掌握准确的射击技巧。苏联青年以巨大的爱国主义热情执行这项任务。在伟大卫国战争开始以前，支援国防和航空化学工业协会联合会训练了几百万“伏罗希洛夫射手”。从这许许多多的人中开始出现一些特别准确的射手，后来他们成了运动健将、全国和世界的冠军和纪录保持者。在伟大卫国战争时期，几十万射击运动员成了狙击手，用他们的准确射击打死德国法西斯侵略者。他们中的许多人由于在前线和敌后的成功的战斗行动被苏联政府奖以勋章和奖章。
    在战后年代，苏联的射击运动成了更加富有群众性的运动，而苏联的射击运动员在国际竞赛中达到了更大的成就。这些成就不是自己来的，它们的取得是顽强的学习和运动竞赛的结果，是研究最适当的练习方法、改进运动技巧、改进射击武器的结果。
    一九二三年苏联举行了第一届全苏射击竞赛。当时射击运动员的射击技巧是不高的。小口径步枪的最好的成绩是一百六十三环（满分是二百环）。现在，大家知道，许多射手在这个项目中已经命中一百九十九环和二百环了。
    蓬勃发展的祖国工业创制了最好的运动用小口径武器和战斗武器，并在大量生产。这种武器使苏联运动员能够取得优良的成绩，同时促进我们射击运动的普遍发展。工厂里的工人亲手建筑供练习射击用的靶场。目前在我国已经有几百个这样的靶场和射击场，这些地方经常举行射击竞赛。
    从一九三五年起，苏联的射击运动员开始参加国际射击竞赛。莫斯科市鲍曼“伏罗希洛夫射手”俱乐部的射击队在一九三五年同朴资茅斯俱乐部（美国）的射击队竞赛。这次竞赛是在各方代表在场的情况下以通讯方式进行的。由十人组成的苏联队在小口径步枪五十公尺项目中以命中二千七百四十一环获胜。美国射手们的成绩是二千五百零八环。在从一九三五年到一九三七年期间，还同美国运动员进行了七次竞赛，其中有五次是苏联运动员获胜。
    在五年中间（一九三五年到一九三九年），我国的射手每年都参加英国小口径武器射击俱乐部协会组织的通讯竞赛。在这五次比赛中有四次也是苏联运动员占先。一九三六年，参加这些竞赛的射手阿列克赛耶夫，在小口径步枪、距离五十公尺的射击中，在世界上第一次命中四百环（满分是四百环）。之后这种成绩屡次出现。
    战后时期，共产党在体育工作方面提出了一项主要的任务——在全国开展群众性的体育运动，提高运动技巧并在这个基础上使苏联运动员在最主要的运动项目上夺取到世界冠军。
    我国的射击运动员也同所有的苏联运动员一道为打破世界纪录而斗争。一九五二年他们在第十五次奥林匹克比赛中夺得了冠军。
    各项射击的全国纪录年年在提高。在保加利亚
  （一九五○年）和罗马尼亚（一九五二年）举行的国际友谊射击竞赛，在培养射击运动员、提高射击技巧和成绩方面，以及在进一步巩固我们各国的运动员和人民间的友谊方面，都起了重要的作用。
      一九五四年，我国射击运动员参加了第三十六届世界射击冠军赛，并在射击运动发展史上写下了新的光荣的一页。十四项中他们夺得了九项冠军。去年世界冠军赛时所创造的二十四项世界纪录中，十九项是属于苏联运动员的。在这几次竞赛中获得了卓越成绩的运动员中，有苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会的射击运动员卡利尼钦科（世界冠军），佩列别林和日古托夫。他们都参加了现在正在北京举行的一九五五年国际友谊射击竞赛大会。
    苏联妇女也成功地掌握着射击艺术。苏联妇女在小口径步枪射击方面所创的全国纪录并不亚于男子的纪录：在满分是二百环的情况下，卧射——二百环，跪射——一百九十九环，立射——一百九十环，三种姿势的总数是五百八十三环。
    现在，苏联射击运动员保持着百分之五十以上的世界纪录。我国射击运动员的这些成就首先应归功于党和政府，因为它们时刻关怀着全国体育和运动的发展。
    在苏联，为了评定运动员的训练水平，制定了从三级射手起到运动健将止的严整的统一运动等级。只有在有相当熟练的运动裁判员参加裁判的竞赛中完成各项考试标准以后，才能授予各种运动员的称号。为了提高射击指标并使射击运动员本身受到锻炼，在各体育团体、机关的最优秀的射击队之间，以及按地区在各州、各边疆区和各共和国的混合射击队之间，经常举行射击竞赛。
    目前，这方面的最大的群众性组织就是上面已提到的苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会，这个组织的任务就是要在苏联全力发展射击运动。
    这个爱国的国防团体的成员们在各工厂、机关、企业、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站中组成小组，他们取得必要的教材，建筑靶场，并在复员军人或青年积极分子——社会活动家的帮助下研究武器和掌握射击技术。所有的课程都在业余时间进行。支援陆海空军志愿协会各区的委员会定期举行各企业和机关射击队之间的竞赛，并编组各区的混合射击队，这些射击队再去参加州的和共和国的射击竞赛。射击运动的这种组织制度使青年能够不脱离学习或工作而掌握准确射击的艺术。
    我国的射击运动员的人数在逐年增加。我们的射击健将和纪录保持者不仅愿意把自己的技巧和经验告诉我国青年，而且也愿意告诉各兄弟国家的青年。
    苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会的运动员们很高兴地接受了中华人民共和国中央国防体育俱乐部提出的参加北京国际友谊射击竞赛的邀请。现在，在到达中华人民共和国的首都以后，我们有机会亲眼看到千千万万兄弟中国的人民在多么热情地建设着自己的新的自由和幸福的生活。我们在北京看见了许多新建筑，而这正是中国民族文化和经济全面高涨的最好的指标。在未到中国以前，我们的射击运动员们虽然对中国朋友的体育活动知道得很少，但是我们深信，中国朋友们正在顽强地进行很多工作。中国政府和中国共产党给他们以很大的帮助。优良的、用最新技术所装备起来的新射击场，对于我们来说，是一件愉快的意外的礼物。这样的射击场我们在欧洲各城市都没有看见过。我们的期望也没有错，在北京举行的这次竞赛确是有趣的、内容丰富的，它无论在竞赛的组织或个别运动员的射击技术方面来说，对所有参加者都是有教育意义的。
    首先我们为主人的成绩而高兴。从竞赛的第一天起，我们就怀着浓厚的兴趣观察中国同志在极短期间所达到的射击技巧。我们为第一次参加国际竞赛的十位中国女同志的成绩而衷心地感到愉快，她们之中九个人的射击成绩超过了我们的全苏统一运动等级制中的运动技巧标准。中华人民共和国的由五人组成的射击队名列苏联和保加利亚之后，获得了第三名。这说明了蕴藏在人民群众深处的伟大力量，说明了我们中国朋友的才干和他们的卓越的坚毅品质，这些都只是在人民民主制度在中国胜利后才开始表现出来的。
    我们在北京举行的竞赛中会见了罗马尼亚、保加利亚、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的著名射手，不久以前我们在布加勒斯特举行的欧洲冠军赛上曾和他们会晤过。我们也很高兴和亚洲人民民主国家的代表获得会晤，他们还是首次参加国际射击运动竞赛的。竞赛是在全体参加者具有高度的运动技巧的水平的情况下进行的。当我指出已达到的成绩的时候，我真诚地希望所有兄弟国家的射击运动员在他们的国内进一步开展群众性的运动，并希望他们在国际竞赛中取得新的，更高的运动成绩。
    在这次竞赛中，我们苏联运动员有机会向中国朋友学习了许多东西，特别是学习进行国际竞赛的组织工作。这种组织工作保证给竞赛的参加者以他们所需要的一切，也包括文化休息在内。尽管有我们的运动员不懂中国话而发生的某些困难，可是我们，也像各兄弟人民民主国家的运动员一样，找到了把自己的印象和运动工作经验告诉中国同志的方法。我们的运动员在中国受到了很大的关注，他们到处都感到了兄弟般的中国人民对待他们的友谊。我想利用这个机会向我们的中国朋友致谢。无论在任何一次国际竞赛中，我们都没有遇到像我们在中国首都举行的这次竞赛中所遇到的这种真挚的友谊气氛，运动员和运动代表团的领导人之间这样的意见一致和互助。毫无疑问，这次竞赛将会进一步巩固参加竞赛的各国人民之间的友谊和互相了解。
