Actively and systematically promote the agricultural cooperative movement
Run well cooperatives jointly formed by farmers of all ethnic groups
Han Yaoying, Director of the Production Cooperation Department of the CPC Linxia Prefectural Committee, Gansu Province; Shan Zongming, Deputy Director

Linxia Prefecture in Gansu Province has seven ethnic groups: Hui, Han, Dongxiang, Bao'an, Tu, Tibetan, and Salar. Among the more than 3,900 natural villages, 40% are villages where multiple ethnic groups live together. This area has relatively fertile soil and abundant water sources, making it an excellent place to develop agricultural production.

Currently, there are 415 agricultural production cooperatives in the prefecture (including three advanced cooperatives formed by immigrants), with 9,607 peasant households participating, accounting for 8.41% of the total number of peasant households. Among these cooperatives, 156 are jointly formed by various ethnic groups. After the reorganization of the cooperatives in the spring and summer, the socialist consciousness of the cooperative members of all ethnic groups has been greatly improved, the management of the cooperatives has improved somewhat, and the cooperatives have been basically consolidated.

The cooperatives jointly organized by various ethnic groups have had a good impact on the farmers of all ethnic groups. This type of cooperative has paved the way for the socialist transformation of agriculture in areas where ethnic groups live together. Before liberation, farmers of all ethnic groups suffered from cruel oppression and exploitation for a long time, and minority farmers were even poorer than Han farmers. In addition to having richer experience in diversified operations, their production technology was relatively backward. After jointly organizing cooperatives, farmers of all ethnic groups can learn from each other, learn from each other's strengths, and develop production. Here are a few obvious examples. The JiJiazhai Agricultural Production Cooperative, jointly formed by farmers of the Hui, Han, Bao'an, and Salar ethnic groups in Tiezhai Township, Linxia County, increased its total agricultural and sideline income in 1955 by 53.6% compared to 1953 before the cooperative was established. The unit area yield of land for 16 minority households increased by 50.8% compared to before joining the cooperative, and the unit area yield of land for minority members was 40% higher than that of minority farmers outside the cooperative. The actual income of the 16 minority households increased by an average of 31.3% compared to before joining the cooperative, and the actual income of the 66 Han households also increased by 21.8%. The Han people in Tanjiacun, the Hui people in Yaolima Village, and the Dongxiang people in Yinwazhuang, KangLe County, although very close to each other, had great barriers in the past due to the instigation of the landlord class and did not communicate with each other. During the land reform in these three villages, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Hui, Han, and Dongxiang farmers overthrew the landlord class and solved the land problem, thus laying the foundation for ethnic unity. However, due to the decentralization of the individual economy, the unity of the farmers of all ethnic groups was still not tight enough. After the Han farmers of Tanjiacun established the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative in 1953, they took the initiative to contact the mutual aid groups of the Hui and Dongxiang ethnic groups. Farmers of all ethnic groups exchanged gifts during festivals and weddings and funerals and helped each other in production and life. In the winter of 1954, under the leadership of Tan Mingfang (Han), Ma Youfu (Hui), and Ma Fucai (Dongxiang), the Unity Agricultural Production Cooperative expanded into a joint cooperative of 50 households. Hui and Dongxiang members also learned new methods of operating animal-powered farm implements and advanced experiences such as potato plum blossom planting and appropriate close planting of wheat. This year, all members have enough grain to eat, and the whole cooperative has sold a large amount of surplus grain. Now, more than 70 surrounding households of various ethnic groups are actively demanding to join this cooperative. Before liberation, a serious ethnic dispute occurred in GaXinji, Linxia County, which greatly damaged the farmers' production. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, a joint Hui-Han mutual aid group appeared here, which was transformed into a cooperative last winter. This year, the cooperative increased production by 40%, and every family has enough food and clothing. For example, the hired peasant Ma Heiwa (Hui) lacked three months' worth of food before joining the cooperative and had to ask his children to work as long-term laborers for others. After joining the cooperative, he had enough to eat and use and bought a farm cattle and sent two children to school. The working farmers of all ethnic groups have established feelings in collective production and eliminated barriers, which has laid a solid foundation for ethnic unity to develop production.

The superiority of agricultural production cooperatives has been generally recognized by farmers of all ethnic groups. They said: We were poor every year when we worked individually, but we turned over in the same year when we joined the cooperative. The ethnic minority farmers in the cooperative also said: After joining the cooperative, we don't have to worry about eating and planting, and barren land has become fertile land. Now, participating in the cooperative has become the demand of the broad masses. Despite the best efforts of some counter-revolutionaries in religious garb to sabotage the cooperative movement, minority farmers, especially those of the Islamic faith, are still joining cooperatives in batches and with enthusiasm. According to statistics as of the end of August, 1,340 mutual aid groups and a large number of individual farmers in the prefecture have signed up for "registration." Recently, the Mao Zedong's instructions on the issue of agricultural cooperation has been conveyed to farmers everywhere, and the farmers of all ethnic groups are even more excited and encouraged, actively participating in the cooperative movement. A new upsurge of the socialist mass movement is coming to Linxia area. Among the existing 12,000 mutual aid groups in Linxia area, many are joint ethnic groups that have been trained for many years. According to a survey of 14 typical townships such as Tiezhai and Gucheng in Linxia County, 66.72% of the poor peasants and new and old lower-middle peasants, who account for 70% of the total number of peasant households, are determined to join the cooperative. The party organizations in Linxia area have also gained experience in leading the establishment of joint cooperatives of farmers of all ethnic groups. Now there are 2,122 Communist Party members in the rural areas of the prefecture, and a large number of activists have emerged in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Among the cadres at the county, district, and township levels, 52% have received professional training in mutual aid and cooperation. Therefore, whether from an objective or subjective point of view, it is entirely possible to run more and better joint cooperatives of farmers of all ethnic groups in the future.

Because the joint cooperatives of farmers of all ethnic groups are the base for promoting ethnic unity, developing production, and attracting farmers of all ethnic groups to realize socialist transformation in areas where ethnic groups live together, we must pay close attention to strengthening the party's leadership over them and vigorously running them well. Based on existing experience, it is very important to do the following things in order to run the joint cooperative well.

First, we must strengthen socialist education and education on diligence and thrift among cooperative members. Through specific examples, repeatedly explain the truth that labor creates wealth and that more work leads to more income, so that cooperative members of all ethnic groups accept the cooperative's distribution principle based on labor and actively participate in labor. At the same time, we must also carry out education on ethnic equality and united production. To consistently implement the party's ethnic policy, we must first constantly overcome the erroneous tendencies of great Han chauvinism and local nationalism. We must advocate that farmers of all ethnic groups teach each other and learn from each other in the cooperative, and especially educate Han members to help minority members improve their culture and farming techniques in order to improve the labor efficiency of the cooperative. Local party organizations should strengthen education for leading backbone members of all ethnic groups within the cooperative (such as representatives of all ethnic groups) so that they are actively responsible, fair in their work, closely united, and set an example for all members.

Second, we must conscientiously embody the principle of mutual respect for customs and habits in daily activities. To this end, we must first educate Han members to consciously abide by the customs and habits of minority ethnic groups. In joint cooperatives, pigs cannot be raised collectively, and Han farmers must have pens for raising pigs; cooperatives cannot ask Hui members to carry pig manure on their backs; breeding livestock in the cooperative should also be managed by individual Han members; and childcare groups should be organized separately for Hui and Han members. The joint cooperative should provide convenience for the religious activities of minority members. If some members earn fewer work points due to religious activities, the cooperative can provide more labor opportunities in other farm work. In addition to spring plowing and threshing, male and female laborers can be organized according to custom, and can be combined or separated; but in general, it is better to separate men and women.

Third, we must actively develop party members among minority ethnic groups and vigorously train minority cadres and activists to run cooperatives. Some Han cadres believe that "minority farmers have a complex history" and "are not educated and are not easy to use." This is a concrete manifestation of great Han chauvinism and must be seriously criticized and overcome. After the establishment of the cooperative, cadres who do not have ethnic prejudice, preferably outstanding minority cadres, should be sent to the cooperative to help with the work. Cadres should also be assigned in the cooperative according to ethnic proportions, and special care should be taken for minority members with particularly few households. In cooperatives with a small proportion of minority cadres, Han cadres must pay special attention to listening to the opinions of minority cadres, and if they have inappropriate opinions, they should patiently persuade and explain to them. In order to meet the cultural needs of minority ethnic groups, cooperatives should set up literacy classes during the slack season to help members of all ethnic groups learn culture, and provide more opportunities for minority members to receive training, visit, and attend meetings, so that they can increase their knowledge, broaden their horizons, and improve their cultural and technical levels and working abilities. When counties train accountants, they should pay attention to selecting minority youth for training. In addition, local party organizations should also combine the work of reorganizing and establishing cooperatives to cultivate and develop party targets and carry out education on the Communist Party and communism among minority members in order to strengthen the party's organization in areas where ethnic groups live together.

Fourth, we must properly handle specific issues related to labor organization. Joint Hui-Han production teams are conducive to mutual teaching and learning, promoting understanding, establishing feelings, and solving the problem of the lack of minority bookkeepers. However, do not put people who have prejudices against each other together; nor should only two or three minority households be included in teams of purely Han members. When selecting cadres for production teams and groups, care should be taken to ensure that all ethnic groups are taken into account to prevent one ethnic group from monopolizing the work. When organizing competitions, more collective awards should be given; when evaluating individual models, the technical conditions of minority members should not be measured in the same way as those of Han members.

Fifth, in the agricultural cooperative movement, we must continue to adhere to the policy of unity and education for the representatives and religious figures of all ethnic groups that have been united and should be united. In the process of establishing and running cooperatives, we should adopt methods such as forums, visits, meetings, and visits to conduct publicity and education on the general line, the five-year plan, and the cooperative policy, and especially address their concerns by repeatedly clarifying the following points: First, the purpose of establishing the cooperative is to develop production, change the poverty situation of farmers of all ethnic groups, and gradually transition to a happy socialist society. The remuneration received by members according to workdays and land is owned by the members themselves, and the payment of religious fees is a matter for the members themselves, and the cooperative and the government will not interfere; second, all ethnic groups in the cooperative are equal, respect each other's customs and habits, and the legitimate religious beliefs and activities of farmers are not restricted after joining the cooperative; third, the people's government adheres to the principle of long-term cooperation and unity with all democratic figures who abide by the constitution, and encourages them to play an active role in the great cause of building socialism.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    办好各族农民联合组成的合作社
    中共甘肃省临夏地委生产合作部部长　韩耀英  副部长　单宗明
    甘肃省临夏专区有回、汉、东乡、保安、土、藏、撒拉七种民族，在三千九百多个自然村中，民族杂居的村就占了百分之四十。这个地区土质比较肥沃，水源充足，发展农业生产的条件是优越的。
    现在全区有四百一十五个农业生产合作社（包括三个移民组成的高级形式的合作社），入社农民九千六百零七户，占总农户的百分之八点四一。在这些合作社中由各民族联合组成的合作社有一百五十六个。经过春、夏两季对合作社的整顿，各族社员的社会主义觉悟大大提高，合作社的经营管理有所改善，合作社基本上得到了巩固。
    各民族联合组织的合作社，对各族农民发生了很好的影响，这种合作社为民族杂居地区的农业的社会主义改造开辟了道路。解放前，各族农民长期受着残酷的压迫和剥削，而少数民族农民比汉族农民更为贫困，他们除在多种经营方面有较丰富的经验外，生产技术比较落后。联合组织合作社后，各少数民族农民和汉族农民就可互教互学，取长补短，发展生产。举几个明显的例子。临夏县铁寨乡回、汉、保安、撒拉四族农民联合组成的姬家寨农业生产合作社，一九五五年农、副业总收入比办社前的一九五三年增加了百分之五十三点六，十六户少数民族社员的土地单位面积产量比入社前增加了百分之五十点八，少数民族社员比社外少数民族农民的土地单位面积产量高四成。十六户少数民族社员的实际收入比入社前平均增加了百分之三十一点三，六十六户汉族社员的实际收入也增加了百分之二十一点八。康乐县谭家村的汉族、腰力马家村的回族和阴洼庄的东乡族，虽然离得很近，但过去由于地主阶级的挑拨，隔阂很大，互不往来。这三个村在土地改革中，回、汉、东乡三族农民在共产党的领导下打倒了地主阶级，解决了土地问题，因而奠定了民族团结的基础。但由于个体经济的分散性，各族农民的团结仍然不够紧密。一九五三年谭家村的汉民族农民创立了团结农业生产合作社以后，主动地同回族和东乡族的互助组取得了联系，各族农民遇有节日、婚丧，礼尚往来，在生产、生活方面互相帮助。一九五四年冬，在谭明芳（汉）、马有福（回）、马富财（东乡族）的带动下，团结农业生产合作社扩大为五十户的联合社。回族和东乡族社员也学会了新式畜力农具操作方法和马铃薯梅花点种、小麦适当密植等先进经验。今年全体社员收入的粮食都够吃，全社并出卖了大批余粮。现在周围七十多户各族农民积极要求参加这个合作社。临夏县尕新集解放前曾发生过严重的民族纠纷，农民的生产因此遭受到很大的破坏；解放后，在共产党的领导下，这里出现了回汉族农民联合互助组，去冬互助组又转为合作社。今年合作社增产四成，家家丰衣足食。如雇农马黑娃（回）入社前一年缺三个月的口粮，不得不叫孩子给人家扛长工；入社后，吃用全够，并且买进一头耕牛，送两个孩子上学读书。各族劳动农民在集体生产中建立了感情，消除了隔阂，这就给民族团结发展生产打下了巩固的基础。
    农业生产合作社的优越性已经为各族农民所公认。他们说：单干时年年受穷，入了社当年翻身。社内少数民族农民也说：入社后吃的种的不愁了，瘦地变成肥地了。现在参加合作社已经成为广大群众的要求。尽管某些披着宗教外衣的反革命分子费尽心思地破坏合作化运动，然而，少数民族农民，特别是信仰伊斯兰教的农民，仍然成批地、热情地加入合作社。根据截至八月底的统计，全专区已有一千三百四十个互助组和大批单干农民报名“挂号”。最近各地向农民传达了毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的指示，各族农民更加兴奋鼓舞，积极参加合作化运动。临夏地区新的社会主义群众运动的高潮就要到来了。临夏地区现有的一万二千多个互助组中，有不少经过多年锻炼的民族联合组。据临夏县铁寨、古城等十四个典型乡的调查，占总农户百分之七十的贫农和新老下中农中，已有百分之六十六点七二的人坚决要求入社。临夏地区的党组织也已经取得了领导办各族农民联合社的经验。现在全区农村已有二千一百二十二名共产党员，在互助合作运动中涌现了大批的积极分子；县、区、乡三级干部中，也有百分之五十二的人受到了互助合作的专业训练。所以，不论从客观或主观条件来看，今后把各族农民联合社办得更多更好，是完全可能的。
    正因为各族农民联合社是民族杂居地区增进民族团结、发展生产、吸引各族农民实现社会主义改造的基地，因此，我们更要十分注意地加强党对它们的领导，大力把它们办好。根据已有的经验，为要办好联合社，做好下面几项工作是很重要的。
    第一、对合作社社员一方面要加强社会主义教育和勤俭节约的教育，通过具体事例，反复说明劳动创造财富、多劳多得的道理，使各族社员接受合作社的以劳为主的分配原则，积极参加劳动。同时还要进行关于民族平等、团结生产的教育。要始终如一地贯彻执行党的民族政策，首先必须不断地克服大民族主义和地方民族主义的错误倾向。要提倡各族农民在合作社中互教互学，特别要教育汉族社员帮助少数民族社员提高文化和耕作技术，以便提高合作社的劳动效率。各地党组织应对合作社内各族领导骨干（如各民族的代表人物）加强教育，使他们积极负责，公道办事，亲密团结，给全体社员作出榜样。
    第二、要切实把互相尊重风俗习惯的原则体现在日常活动中去。为此，必须首先教育汉族社员自觉地遵守少数民族的风俗习惯。在联合社中，不能集体喂猪，汉族农民养猪要有圈；合作社不能叫回族社员背猪粪；社内的种畜也应当让汉族社员个人经营；抱娃组要分开回汉分别组织。联合社对于少数民族社员的宗教活动，应给予方便，有的社员如果因宗教活动而少挣工分，合作社可以在其他农活上多给予一些劳动的机会。除春耕、打场外，男女劳动力可依照习惯加以组织，可合则合，可分则分；但一般以男女分开较好。
    第三、要在少数民族中积极发展党员，大力培养少数民族的办社骨干和积极分子。有些汉族干部认为“少数民族农民历史复杂”“没文化，不顺手”。这是大汉族主义思想的具体表现，必须严肃地加以批判和克服。在建社以后应当派没有民族偏见的，最好是优秀的少数民族干部驻社帮助工作。社内也应该按照民族比例配备干部，对于户数特少的少数民族社员，更应加以照顾。少数民族干部比例小的社，汉族干部必须特别注意倾听少数民族干部的意见，如果他们有不妥当的意见，也要对他们进行耐心的说服解释。为了满足少数民族的文化要求，合作社应设立农闲识字班，帮助各族社员学习文化，并多给少数民族社员受训、参观、开会的机会，使他们增长见闻，开阔眼界，提高文化技术水平和工作能力。各县训练会计的时候，应注意挑选少数民族青年去受训练。此外，各地党组织还要结合整社、建社工作，培养发展党的对象，向少数民族社员进行关于共产党和共产主义的教育，以便壮大民族杂居地区的党的组织。
    第四、要妥善地处理有关劳动组织方面的具体问题。回汉联合编生产队，便于互教互学，促进谅解，建立感情，并且能解决少数民族记账员缺乏的问题。但不要把互有成见的人编在一起；也不宜在纯汉族社员的队里只编进两三户少数民族。生产队、组推选骨干时要照顾到各民族，防止一个民族包办的现象。组织竞赛的时候应多发集体奖；评选个人模范的时候，对于少数民族社员的技术条件，不可同汉民一般衡量。
    第五、在农业合作化运动中，对于已经团结和应该团结的一切民族的代表人物、宗教界人士，要继续坚持团结、教育的方针。在建社、办社过程中，应采取座谈、访问、开会、参观等方式，对他们进行关于总路线、五年计划和合作化政策的宣传教育，特别要针对他们的顾虑，反复讲清以下几点：一、建社的目的是为了发展生产，改变各族农民的贫困状况，逐步过渡到幸福的社会主义社会。社员按劳动日和土地分得的报酬为社员个人所有，交纳宗教费用是社员个人的事，合作社和政府都不加干涉；二、社内各民族一律平等，互相尊重风俗习惯，农民入社后正当的宗教信仰和宗教活动不受限制；三、人民政府对遵守宪法的各方面的民主人士坚持长期合作和团结的原则，鼓励他们在建设社会主义的伟大事业中发挥积极的作用。
