Actively and systematically carry out the agricultural cooperative movement; The process of building cooperatives is a process of ideological education.

This autumn, when the Party branch of Xifeng Township, Xingyang County, Henan Province, was building cooperatives, it initially encountered resistance from cadres' conservative ideas. Xifeng Township originally had five agricultural production cooperatives, with peasant households joining the cooperatives accounting for 24% of the township's total households. All five cooperatives increased production. More than 85% of the cooperative members increased their income. Peasants outside the cooperatives generally recognized that agricultural cooperatives had "large family property, abundant fertilizer, good crops, and high yields," and more and more peasants wanted to join. However, from last winter to after the wheat harvest this year, not a single new cooperative member was admitted to the five cooperatives. The work team and the Party branch adhered to the policy of "stopping development and concentrating on consolidation," keeping the doors of the cooperatives tightly closed. Even after Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" was conveyed, the cadres' thinking did not change. Some of them cited the facts that some cooperative members did not work hard and had grievances, indicating that the cooperatives were not yet consolidated, and development was dangerous. If this right-leaning thinking of the cadres is not overcome, the work of building cooperatives cannot be carried out.
An effective way to overcome right-leaning thinking is to educate Party members and cadres to understand the thoughts and attitudes of the masses of all classes towards the cooperative movement through class analysis. To achieve this, the village-based work team helped the township branch conduct a class analysis based on the current economic situation of the peasant households. The township currently has 52 poor peasant households, accounting for 8% of the total households; 439 new and old lower-middle peasant households, accounting for 67% of the total households; 126 new and old upper-middle peasant households, accounting for 19% of the total households; and 40 landlord and rich peasant households, accounting for 6% of the total households. Through class analysis, it can be seen that 491 households, or 75% of the total households in the township, still have difficulties in production and life. Among them, in addition to some who have already joined the cooperatives, there are many who are eager to join. The actual situation is indeed the case. For example, poor peasant Feng Fuqing had great difficulties in production due to the lack of farm tools and livestock and went to the director of the First Cooperative five times, insisting on joining. Lower-middle peasant Du Heniu ran to the homes of her three daughters (all of whom were cooperative members) to inquire about when the cooperative would expand. While conducting the class analysis, the branch conveyed Chairman Mao's report to the masses. The broad masses were overjoyed. This situation greatly educated the cadres. On this basis, the work team further explained the central government's instructions to the Party members and cadres, and everyone quickly accepted them.
As soon as the news of the agricultural cooperatives' preparation for development was announced, a surge of peasants demanding to join the cooperatives immediately formed. Eight mutual aid teams in the township registered to transfer to cooperatives, and poor peasants and lower-middle peasants voluntarily connected and actively prepared to build cooperatives. The upper-middle peasants who had previously expressed unwillingness to join the cooperatives also went to the cadres and cooperative directors to request to join. At this time, some Party members and cadres, on the one hand, regretted that they had suppressed the enthusiasm of the peasants to join the cooperatives in the past, and on the other hand, were satisfied with the current enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperatives, thinking that now everything was "ready," and that cooperatives could be built without doing any more work. Can cooperatives be built in this way? In fact, some upper-middle peasants were applying to join the cooperatives with a helpless mood. For example, after upper-middle peasant Feng Ermao applied to join the cooperative, he said to people: "Households like mine suffer from joining the cooperative, and it's not okay not to join. Anyway, we can't survive." Upper-middle peasant Zhang Xile said: "Now they're casting nets everywhere and sending troops from all directions. All the intersections are blocked. Even if Chongzhen doesn't want to die, he has to go to Coal Mountain." Another part of the upper-middle peasants, although they wanted to join the cooperatives, wanted to run a cooperative with peasants who were well-matched. Even poor peasants and lower-middle peasants still had many ideological problems. While handing in their applications to join the cooperatives, they still had concerns about how to deal with some specific issues after joining. For example, Du Jingchun had long wanted to join the cooperative, but he was still afraid that he would not be able to afford the debts after joining. Du Wensong was afraid that after joining the cooperative, the wheat straw would be public and he would not be able to thatch his house. These problems seem very simple, but they cannot be solved at once in the peasants' minds. If they are not solved, they will become a worry and affect the peasants' enthusiasm for building cooperatives.
From these situations, it is necessary to further improve ideological education in order to do a good job in building cooperatives. Therefore, the Xifeng Township branch further publicized the superiority of cooperatives and the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, and explained the specific methods for building cooperatives. The voluntary policy was clarified to peasants who did not actually want to join. In terms of methods, the following were adopted: 1. Explanation at large meetings; 2. Holding small seminars for different objects; 3. Organizing key members for individual connections. Through small seminars and individual connections, the masses of all classes freely exposed their thoughts and raised questions, so ideological problems were solved more deeply. As a result, the peasants who were preparing to join the cooperative became more determined, and those who were following the trend became more conscious. The illusion brought about by the upsurge also disappeared. This laid a solid ideological foundation for the work of building cooperatives.
When starting to build cooperatives and expand old cooperatives, the problems became more complicated. All five old cooperatives in the township were preparing to expand, and eight mutual aid teams were preparing to build five new cooperatives. Each cooperative and team found their own expansion and construction targets, which led to competition for key members and cooperative members between the old cooperatives and between the cooperatives and mutual aid teams. They competed for middle peasants who were strong in personnel, horses, and land, and mutually excluded orphaned, widowed, or poor peasants. Some cooperatives and teams had already made calculations before expanding or building the cooperatives: whose family had cattle, whose family had carts, whose family had a house as a warehouse, and whose family had an empty garden to raise livestock. They planned everything properly. If anyone disrupted their plans, they would become emotional and have opinions.
The root cause of the above phenomena is still that the education on class policy is not carried out deeply enough, and cadres and activists are not conscious enough in accepting the class policy, so they deviated from the correct approach when implementing the policy. The Xifeng Township branch once again conducted education on the class policy for Party members, cadres, and activists; and analyzed with everyone the reasons why the cadres of each cooperative excluded poor peasants and competed for middle peasants: First, they believed that poor peasants had an empty foundation, "not much to gain, and many problems." Second, they believed that poor peasants did not have "talents to command," would not manage or lead, and that cooperatives could not be run without middle peasants. Third, they wanted to take economic advantage of the middle peasants. The branch repeatedly explained the class policy in response to these erroneous ideas and led everyone to discuss. During the discussion, everyone realized that poor peasants are the most determined people to take the socialist road, and only by relying on poor peasants can cooperatives be run well; at the same time, they also corrected their attitude towards middle peasants. A key member of the newly built cooperative in Xifeng Village said: "The east and west cooperatives are competing for an upper-middle peasant, Feng Falei. In fact, he said that he doesn't want to join any cooperative. It's useless for us to compete." Finally, everyone clarified that it is necessary to first organize the poor peasants, establish the leading advantage of the poor peasants, adhere to the policy of voluntary mutual benefit, and closely unite the middle peasants in order to run the cooperatives well. The problem of excluding poor peasants, competing for middle peasants, and competing for key members was solved. After connecting and preparing, the five old cooperatives that were preparing to expand and the five new cooperatives that were preparing to establish quickly determined their members.
During the self-preparation and connection of each cooperative, due to different foundations and limitations of living conditions, some cooperatives had many key members, some had insufficient key members, some were too large, and some were very small. The branch suggested to each cooperative to adjust some key members and a small number of cooperative members under possible conditions. After the suggestion was made, most of the key members obeyed the branch's opinion, but some people did not agree. Some old cooperatives were afraid of taking away the key members in their cooperatives. Some key members who were transferred were unwilling to leave the old cooperatives. The branch also educated them on collectivism, and the problem of uneven distribution of key members and the problem of cooperatives being too large or too small between the cooperatives was also solved.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    建社工作的过程就是进行思想教育的过程
    缪锜
    今年秋天，河南省荥阳县西冯乡党支部在进行建社的时候，一开始就遇到了干部保守思想的抵触。西冯乡原来有五个农业生产合作社，入社农户占全乡总农户的百分之二十四。五个社全部增加了产量。百分之八十五以上的社员增加了收入。社外农民公认农业合作社是“家业大，积肥多，庄稼好，产量高”，要求入社的农民越来越多。但是，从去年冬天到今年麦收以后，五个社一户新社员也没有吸收。工作组和党支部坚持着“停止发展、全力巩固”的方针，把合作社的大门关得紧紧的。直到毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告传达下来，干部思想还转不过弯来。他们有的人列举了一些社员不干活、闹意见的事实，说明合作社还不巩固，发展是有危险的。干部中的这种右倾思想不加以克服，建社工作就无法进行。
    克服右倾思想的有效办法，是教育党员、干部用阶级分析的办法来认识各阶层群众对合作化运动的思想和态度。为了作到这一点，驻村工作组帮助乡支部按照目前各户农民的经济情况，进行了阶级分析。全乡现有贫农五十二户，占总户数的百分之八；新、老下中农四百三十九户，占总农户的百分之六十七；新、老上中农一百二十六户，占总户数的百分之十九；地主、富农四十户，占总户数的百分之六。通过阶级分析，可以看到全乡有四百九十
  一户，即占总户数百分之七十五的农民，生产生活仍有困难，他们当中除一部分已入社的人以外，还有许多人是迫切要求入社的。实际情况也正是这样。如贫农冯福庆，没有农具牲口，生产困难很大，连续找第一社社长五次，非入社不可。下中农杜合妞，为了入社跑遍了三个女儿家（都是社员），打听什么时候扩大社。在进行阶级分析的同时，支部向群众传达了毛主席的报告。广大群众欢欣鼓舞。这一情况，使干部受到了很大的教育。工作组就在这个基础上对党员、干部进一步讲解中央的指示，大家很快就接受了。
    农业合作社准备发展的消息一公布，农民要求入社立刻形成了热潮。全乡有八个互助组挂号转社，贫农和下中农自动串连，积极酝酿建社。原来表示不愿入社的上中农也纷纷找干部、找社长要求入社。在这个时候，部分党员、干部一面懊悔自己过去压抑了农民的入社积极性，一面满足于目前群众要求入社的热情，认为现在是“万事具备”了，认为不要再作什么工作就可以建社了。能不能就这样建社呢？因为实际上，一部分上中农是抱着无可奈何的心情申请入社的。如上中农冯二卯申请入社以后对人说：“像我这疙瘩户，入社吃亏，不入社不行，反正是不能过。”上中农张喜乐说：
  “现在是到处撒网，四面发兵，是路口都堵死了，崇祯不想死也得上煤山。”另一部分上中农，虽然要求入社，却是要和门当户对的农民办一个社。即令是贫农和下中农，也还有不少思想问题。他们一面递上了入社申请书，一面对入社后怎样处理一些具体问题仍然有顾虑。如杜景春早就要求入社，但还是怕入社以后担负不起债务。杜文松怕入了社麦草归公没法苫房。这些问题看起来好像很简单，但在农民思想上并不是一下子就能解决的，如果不加以解决，它们就会成为一块心病，影响农民办社的积极性。
    从这些情况看来，必须进一步作好思想教育工作，才能把建社工作做好。因此，西冯乡支部进一步地宣传了合作社的优越性和自愿互利政策，交代了建社的具体办法。对实际不愿入社的农民讲清了自愿政策。在方式上采取了：一、大会讲解；二、分别对象召开小型座谈会；三、组织骨干分子进行个别串连。通过小型座谈会和个别串连的方式，使各阶层群众自由地暴露了思想，提出了疑问，因此也更深入地解决了思想问题。结果，准备入社的农民，犹豫的坚定了，随大流的变为自觉的了；高潮带来的假象也消除了。这就给建社工作打下了坚实的思想基础。
    在开始建社和扩大老社的时候，问题更加复杂了。全乡五个老社都准备扩大，有八个互助组准备建成五个新社，各社各组自己找自己的扩社建社对象，这就使老社和老社之间，合作社和互助组之间产生了争骨干、争社员的现象，对人强、马壮、地好的中农互相争夺，对孤寡户或贫苦农民则互相排斥。有的社、组在扩、建社以前就打好了算盘：谁家有牛，谁家有车，谁家上房当仓库，谁家空园喂牲口，计划得妥妥当当，如果谁一打乱他们的计划，就闹情绪，闹意见。
    产生上述现象的根源，仍然是阶级政策的教育进行得不够深入，干部和积极分子在接受阶级政策上不够自觉，因此在执行政策时又走了样子。西冯乡支部再次对党员、干部、积极分子进行了阶级政策的教育；和大家一起分析了各社干部排斥贫农、争夺中农的原因：第一是认为贫农底子空，“油水不多，难题不少”。第二是认为贫农没有“帅才”，不会经营，不会领导，而中农会计划，会料理，所以离开中农就办不成社。第三是想在经济上占中农的便宜。支部针对这些错误思想反复讲解了阶级政策，领导大家进行讨论。讨论中大家认识了贫农是走社会主义道路最坚决的人，只有依靠贫农才能把社办好；同时也端正了对待中农的态度。西冯村新建社的一个骨干分子说：“东、西两个社争一个上中农冯法雷，实际上人家说哪个社也不愿入。咱们争也是白搭。”最后，大家明确了必须首先把贫农组织起来，树立贫农领导优势，坚持自愿互利政策，紧密团结中农，才能把社办好。排斥贫农、争中农、争骨干的问题解决了，全乡五个准备扩大的老社，五个准备建立的新社，经过串连酝酿，很快便确定了成员。
    在各社自行酝酿串连中，由于基础好坏不同，居住条件的限制，有些社骨干很多，有些社骨干不够，有些社过大，有些社很小。支部对各社提出在可能条件下调整部分骨干和少数社员的意见。意见提出后，大部分骨干是服从支部意见的，但是也有一些人思想不通。有的老社害怕抽走自己社内的骨干。有的被调动的骨干不愿离开老社。支部又对他们进行了集体主义的教育，各社之间的骨干多少不均、社过大过小的问题也得到了解决。
