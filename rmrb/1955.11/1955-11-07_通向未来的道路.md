    The Road to the Future
    Soviet Union  Dé· Sāsīlāfúsījī
    Among the many significant and noteworthy events that accompany the thirty-eighth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, I would like to discuss two things. One is from domestic life: the damming of the Volga River near Kuibyshev, a decisive stage in the massive construction of dams and power stations on the Volga; the other is from international life: the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference and the role of the Soviet Union in this conference.
    Building hydroelectric power stations on large rivers is not new in world history, but the construction currently underway on the Volga is new and unprecedented. It's not just building one power station, but building many tiers. The entire Volga River—almost from its source to its mouth—is being conquered by reinforced concrete and steel. One of Europe's largest rivers is no longer a river that has flowed since ancient times along its naturally laid riverbed, with its own banks, shoals, and tributaries. The Volga is becoming a system of artificial lakes, reservoirs for ships, steamers, barges, and rafts, and a chain of seas. First and foremost, the Volga is becoming a huge power system supplying industry and culture with powerful energy. The new Volga, created by the Soviet people under the guidance and leadership of the Communist Party, is itself generating a new character that is more rational and better suited to human needs than the formerly intractable forces of nature.
    A comparison can illustrate the situation. The Missouri-Mississippi River in the United States occupies roughly the same position as the Volga River in the Soviet Union. These two major waterways traverse various regions of the country. The vast basins of both rivers encompass various climate zones and almost all areas—industrial and agricultural. The largest industrial cities are located on the banks of the rivers. The Mississippi River is larger than the Volga in terms of its length and potential energy. Navigation on American rivers started earlier than on Russian rivers and has achieved greater development. The United States is a capitalist country with advanced technology that has existed for over two hundred years. The Soviet Union is celebrating the thirty-eighth anniversary of its socialist economy and culture.
    But what do we see, what does the world see?
    The Mississippi River remains a major transportation artery, just as it was in the past. Its water only flows to transport ships carrying goods and passengers. Billions of kilowatt-hours of power generation capacity are not utilized. Only a very small portion of the powerful water flow is used for irrigation. From its overall appearance, this American river is not too far removed from the era of Lincoln, the rowing boy who traveled along the river in his small boat almost a century ago and later became a great American president.
    The Volga River not only remains a major transportation artery, but also greatly expands its significance. But its greatest role is as a source of power. Millions of "horsepower" are borne by dozens of powerful water turbines. How can those small dams on the Missouri River and the upper reaches of the Mississippi River and the power stations with a total of less than half a million kilowatts be compared to the giant hydroelectric power stations on the Volga River?
    But the Volga River water, which drives the turbines of each hydroelectric station tier, is not satisfied with this. In the downstream areas, a portion of the river water is diverted along irrigation canals, distributing life-giving water across vast arid and semi-desert lands through a dense network of small tributaries. How endless is the wise productive labor, how magnificent is the spirit of technological thought, and how large is the team of capable and experienced experts!
    It should be understood that the Volga River is not unique—construction is underway everywhere. For our generation, how distant it seems that the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station was built! At that time, the whole country participated in this construction. It became the sole focus of the people's attention. The work was so intense that the clever people in the capitalist world shook their heads in doubt: Could the audacious Bolsheviks successfully build the largest hydroelectric station in Europe?
    Now, on the thirty-eighth anniversary of the October Revolution, the Communists in the Soviet Union have not only built one huge hydroelectric station, but a series of hydroelectric stations with unparalleled generating capacity in the world. At the same time, they are building the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Station on the Dnieper River, the Angara River hydroelectric station tier near Irkutsk, and some other enormous hydroelectric stations that seem to be built unnoticed. Alongside these hydroelectric power stations are the newly established world's first atomic energy power stations.
    Precisely during these days when the work of cutting off the Volga River near Kuibyshev was completed, the customary large flood that has become the norm for the Mississippi River occurred in the United States. Raging floods submerged houses, swallowed people, destroyed crops, and caused billions of dollars in losses. Americans have become accustomed to the wayward ferocity of the Missouri River and the Mississippi River. This has become a "rule" there. People cannot tame the raging rivers after heavy rains and snowmelt. They are helpless. Capitalism has not only failed to improve the situation, but has even made it worse. Indiscriminate deforestation and land reclamation have led to soil erosion and increased corrosion, so floods have become more ferocious and caused greater disasters.
    For a country like the United States, floods are a shameful phenomenon.
    Severe floods sometimes occur in China, but in China, this is the result of the twenty-two-year civil war that destroyed the old water conservancy facilities that regulated water volume. Americans and Britons once exploited China's rivers to extract millions of dollars, but these "representatives of civilization" never contributed a single effort to effectively combat destructive floods.
    Now, the new, socialist masters have begun to build water conservancy projects on the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, building power stations with dams and locks. Controlling the forces of water is being carried out along with industrialization and agricultural collectivization. Who can doubt that in the shortest period, China's tamed rivers will guarantee navigation, irrigate vast areas, and give their latent power to the people?
    The masters of the United States, the main capitalist country, cannot take on the task of conquering nature, are unable to and unwilling to. River construction is necessary for the people, but it cannot bring the enormous profits to monopoly organizations that the arms industry provides. Preparing for destructive wars is more profitable than taming the forces of nature.
    Look, the great construction project on the Volga River, the tier of construction projects, is the brilliant victory of socialism. This is labor that opens up new roads for mankind in a new era. We have no way to talk about the competition between capitalism and socialism in this regard, because for capitalism, this road is impassable. This civilizational task of world historical scale is beyond the competence of a dying socio-economic system.
    And we Soviet people are not alone on this road to the cultural victory of communism. The people of other countries are walking with us. Looking back at the road we have traveled, we see some "theoretical" questions among the things that once flourished briefly, once lived and disappeared, once boasted with luxuriant burdock and have long been shoveled away by the powerful plow of socialism. It should be understood that there was a time when a debate occurred about whether socialism could be built in one country alone, and it was finally proven that those "theories" that stubbornly tried to say that this construction was impossible were absurd and unscientific. Why is this? This is not only because socialism has already been built in "one" country, in the Soviet Union; it is also because it is no longer a "single" socialist country at all. As our great teachers predicted, along with "one" country, many countries are also successfully building socialism, and they are not "single," they are a new family of peoples closely united by common goals, common paths, and great and deep friendship.
    Now at the Geneva Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov speaks alone against the other three foreign ministers, but it should be understood that he is actually not alone. If we count the people of the countries that have embarked on the road of socialism, he actually represents one-third of humanity. If we count those who have not embarked on the road of socialism but have left the road of imperialism and in any case do not agree to regard the ministers of the United States, France, and Britain as protectors of their interests, then he represents more than half of humanity.
    The Geneva Conference discusses not only the fate of the four countries, but the fate of all countries—the peoples of large and small countries. Standing behind the three foreign ministers are capitalist countries, standing behind one foreign minister are socialist countries. There are also hundreds of millions of people who have not yet decided which side to join, placing their hopes on which side.
    The strength standing behind one foreign minister at the Geneva Conference is the strength of indivisible unity. This is a rock-solid force. The forces standing behind the three foreign ministers are disunited. Internal contradictions have shattered the capitalist world, and to conceal this point, to show the world their nominal unity, the three foreign ministers are making incredible efforts. For this very reason, they are holding secret meetings in Geneva, engaging in transactions and resale activities in the dark diplomatic exchange.
    We do not want to speculate on what the outcome of this meeting will be. But the meeting of three foreign ministers and one foreign minister has become a historical necessity and is an important matter. The "Cold War" has been lost by those who planned it. Yesterday's dishes can be reheated, but people who are opening up the road to lasting peace must never be allowed to eat such dishes. This road is becoming increasingly wide, and many new obstacles have appeared on the road to war.
    We have every reason to look forward with hope. Pessimism is alien to us. The Soviet people are welcoming the thirty-eighth anniversary of historic victory in a better international environment than when they welcomed the thirty-seventh anniversary. This is the great victory of the policy of peace that the Soviet people declared on the first day they seized power.

    通向未来的道路
    苏联  德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    在随着伟大十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念日而来的许多重大的和引人注目的事件中，我想提出两件事情来谈谈。一件是国内生活中的：在古比雪夫附近拦断了伏尔加河，这是伏尔加河上堤坝和电站的巨大建设的一个决定性阶段；另一件是国际生活中的：日内瓦外长会议和苏联在这个会议上的作用。
    在巨大的河流上建设水电站，在世界历史上并不是什么新事情，但是，目前在伏尔加河上进行的这样的建设，却是新的、空前的。这不是建设一个电站，而是建设许多梯级。整个伏尔加河——几乎从河源一直到河口——都被钢筋混凝土和钢所征服了。欧洲一条最大的河流不再是自古以来就沿着自己由大自然所铺设的河床奔流、有着自己的河岸、浅滩和支流的河流了。伏尔加河正在变成人工湖的系统和轮船、汽船、驳船、木筏的航路的水库以及海的链条。首先伏尔加河正在成为一个供给工业和文化以强大能量的巨大的动力系统。苏联人遵照共产党的指示并在共产党领导下用双手创造的新伏尔加河，它本身正在产生着比从前的难以驯服的自然力更合理、更适合于人类需要的新的性格。
    对比是可以说明情况的。密苏里—密士失必河在美国大约和伏尔加河在苏联占着同样的地位。这两条水路干线贯穿全国各个区域。两条河的广大流域包括各种气候地带和几乎一切区域——工业区和农业区。在河的两岸有最大的工业城市。密士失必河按它的长度和蕴藏的能量来说大于伏尔加河。美国河流上的航运业比俄国河流上的航运业开始得早些，并获得了更大的发展。美国是一个已经有两百多年的、有先进技术的资本主义国家。苏联正在庆祝自己的社会主义经济和文化的三十八周年。
    但是我们看到的、全世界看到的是什么呢？
    密士失必河正像过去一样仍然是一条大的运输干线。它的水只是为了运送装载货物和旅客的船只而奔流。几十亿瓩的发电能力没有利用。强大的水流只有极小部分用于灌溉。从整个外貌来看，这条美国的河流离开那个几乎是一百年以前撑着他的小船沿河行驶的划船孩子，后来做了伟大的美国总统的林肯的时代，为时并不太远。
    伏尔加河不仅仍然是一条大运输干线、而且还大大地扩大了它的意义。但是它的最大作用就是作为动力的源泉。数百万“马力”由几十个强大的水轮机担负着。密苏里河和密士失必河上游的那些不大的堤坝和总共还不到五十万瓩的发电站又怎能同伏尔加河的水电站巨人相比呢？
    但是推动各水电站梯级的水轮机的伏尔加河河水并不满足于这点。在下游区，河水的一部分沿着灌溉渠分散开来，并沿着干旱的、半沙漠的广大土地用细小支流的密网分配着唤醒生命的水分。智慧的生产劳动是多么无穷无尽，技术思想的气魄是多么宏伟，而能干的、有经验的专家的队伍又是多么壮大啊！
    要知道伏尔加河并不是独一无二的——到处都在进行建筑。对于我们这一代人来说，第聂伯水电站建成的时间，已经好像是多么遥远的事了！当时全国都参加了这个建设。它成了人民注意的唯一的中心。工作非常紧张，于是资本主义世界的聪明人怀疑地摇着头：大胆的布尔什维克们能够建设成功欧洲最大的水电站吗？
    现在，到十月革命三十八周年的时候，共产党人在苏联建成的已不仅是一个巨大的水电站，而是在发电能力上举世无双的一系列水电站的梯级，同时他们正在第聂伯河上建筑卡霍夫卡水电站，在伊尔库茨克附近建筑安加拉河的水电站梯级，以及别的一些最巨大的、但却好像并不被注意地建筑着的水电站。而同这些水力发动的电站并列的则是新建立着的世界上第一批原子能发电站。
    恰好正是在古比雪夫附近完成截断伏尔加河工作的这些日子，在美国发生了照例的、已成为密士失必这条河的规律的大泛滥。汹涌的洪水淹没了房屋、吞没了人们、冲毁了庄稼，造成了亿万元的损失。美国人已习惯于密苏里河和密士失必河的这种逞性的狂暴。这已成为他们那里的一种“规律”。人们不能驯服大雨和融雪以后的狂暴的河流。他们束手无策。资本主义不仅没有改善情况，甚至还使情况恶化了。滥伐森林，乱垦田地，使得水土流失，浸蚀加重，于是水灾变得更加狂暴，并造成更大的灾难。
    对于像美国这样一个国家说来，水灾是一种可耻的现象。
    中国有时也发生惨重的水灾，但是在中国，这是使旧的调节水量的水利设施遭到破坏的二十二年国内战争的结果。美国人和英国人曾经利用中国的河流榨取到千百万美元，但是这些“文明的代表者”却不曾为了同毁灭性的水灾作有效的斗争出过一点力气。
    现在，新的、社会主义的主人已经着手在黄河和长江上建设水利工程，建设有堤坝和闸门的发电站。控制水的自然力是同工业化，同农业合作化一齐进行的。在最短时期内，中国的被驯服了的河流将保证航行，灌溉广大的面积，并把它们潜藏的动力给予人民，这有谁能怀疑呢。
    美国这个主要的资本主义国家的主人，却不能担当起征服自然的任务，不能够也不愿意。河流上的建设是人民所必需的，但是它不能给垄断组织带来如像军火工业给予的巨额利润。准备毁灭性的战争是比驯服自然力更加有利可图的。
    看一看吧，伏尔加河上的伟大建设工程，梯级建设工程，就是社会主义的辉煌的胜利。这是为人类开辟了新道路的新时代的劳动。我们没有办法谈资本主义和社会主义在这方面的竞赛，因为对资本主义说来这条路是不通的。这种世界历史规模的文明的任务，是垂死的社会经济制度所不能胜任的。
    而我们苏联人在这条通向共产主义文化胜利的道路上不是孤单的。其他国家的人民同我们走在一起。回顾一下以前经历过的道路，我们在那曾经昙花一现、曾经生存和消逝、曾经以繁茂的牛蒡煊赫一时而早已被社会主义的强大犁头铲掉的东西中间，看到了某种“理论性的”问题。要知道，曾经有个时候，发生过关于能不能单独在一个国家建成社会主义的争论，并且终于证明那些顽固地企图把这种建设说成不可能实现的“理论”是荒诞无稽和不科学的。这是为什么呢？这不仅由于社会主义已经在“一个”国家，在苏联建成；还由于根本已经不是“单独一个”社会主义国家。正如我们的伟大导师所预见到的，随着“一个”国家，许多国家也在成功地建设着社会主义，而它们都不是“单独的”，它们都是由一致的目标、共同的道路和伟大深厚的友谊密切团结起来的各国人民的新家庭。
    现在在日内瓦会议上苏联外交部长莫洛托夫一个人发言反对另外三个外交部长，可是要知道实际上他并不是单人独马。如果把已步上社会主义道路的国家的人民计算在内，他实际上代表着三分之一的人类。如果把那些虽没有步上社会主义道路，可是已经离开了帝国主义道路，并且无论如何都不同意把美国、法国和英国的部长们看作是自己的利益的保护者的人们计算在内，那末他就代表着一半以上的人类了。
    日内瓦会议上讨论的不只是四国的命运，而是所有国家的——大国和小国的人民的命运。站在三个外长后面的是资本主义国家，站在一个外长后面的是社会主义国家。还有几亿人，他们还没有决定要参加那一方面，把自己的希望寄托在那一方面。
    在日内瓦会议上站在一个外长后面的力量，是不可分割的团结一致的力量。这是一种坚如磐石的力量。站在三个外长后面的力量是不团结的。内部的矛盾使资本主义世界支离破碎，为了掩饰这点，为了向世界显示他们的有名无实的团结，三个外长在作着使人难于置信的努力。就为着这个，他们在日内瓦暗地里举行秘密会议，在黑暗的外交交易所里进行交易和转卖的勾当。
    我们不想去猜测，这次会晤的结果将是什么。可是三个外长和一个外长的会晤成了历史的一种必要却是一件重要的事。“冷战”被策划它的那些人输掉了。昨天的菜是可以热一热的，可是决不能拿这种菜让开辟通向持久和平道路的人民来吃，这条道路正在变得日益广阔，同时在战争的道路上已出现了许多新障碍。
    我们有满怀希望向前看的一切理由。悲观主义对于我们是陌生的。苏联人民在比迎接三十七周年的时候更好的国际环境中来迎接历史性胜利的三十八周年。这是苏联人民在取得政权的第一天就宣布了的和平政策的伟大胜利。
