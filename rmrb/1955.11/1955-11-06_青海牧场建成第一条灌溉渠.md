    The First Irrigation Canal Completed at Qinghai Ranch
    The first grassland canal on the Qinghai Province state-run Sanjiaocheng Ranch – the 40-Li Jintan Canal – has recently been completed. The water volume of the Jintan Canal can irrigate more than 25,000 mu of ranch farmland and the land of nearby farmers.
    Before liberation, the bandit Ma Bufang, under the guise of repairing canals, extorted and blackmailed the local people, levied funds, and seized people. After repairing the canal for a whole year, the local people never saw a drop of water. This year, after the news that the state invested more than 380,000 yuan to build a canal here in June spread, local herdsmen and farmers came to transport earth and stone with their vehicles and yaks to support the canal construction project. With the support of the local people, the canal construction workers completed the Jintan Canal in just over four months. (Gu Qun)

    青海牧场建成第一条灌溉渠
    青海省国营三角城牧场的草原上，最近建成了第一条草原上的水渠——长四十里的金滩渠。金滩渠的水量能灌溉周围二万五千多亩牧场农田和附近农民的土地。
    解放前，马匪步芳曾以修渠为名，向当地人民敲榨勒索、派款抓人。修了整整一年的渠，当地人民始终没有见到一滴水。今年六月国家投资三十八万余元在这里修建水渠的消息传出后，当地牧民、农民纷纷出车、出牦牛来运输土方砂石，支援修渠工程。修渠职工在当地人民支援下，经过四个多月便建成了金滩渠。　（古群）
