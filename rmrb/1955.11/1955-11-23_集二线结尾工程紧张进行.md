To ensure the timely opening of through rail service between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, the workers constructing the Jining-Eren Railway are working hard on the finishing touches. What used to be a grazing ground for cattle and sheep and a racecourse for residents in the northern square of Jining has now been built into one of China's largest and most modern stations. Currently, workers are laying asphalt felt, installing machinery, and building passenger car transfer facilities, striving for a successful completion of the project. In Erenhot, the newly built land port of China, construction workers are painting houses, installing glass, wiring electricity, patching holes, and repairing corners. The water supply team workers are installing waterway markers at the bends of the water channels and climbing on top of the water tower to apply waterproof sealant. The road construction workers of the Third Engineering Section, First Work Zone of the Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways are repairing the roadbed, bridges, and culverts. In the Eighth Work Zone of the Second Section, near the Bawang River Bridge, the road construction workers are repairing more than 400 items, leveling the track, tightening screws, and carrying ballast to fill the earth. They completed three days' worth of work in two and a half days. Rows of snow fences have been erected in areas along the Jining-Eren Railway that are prone to snow damage. The workers installing the new Soviet-style signals at various stations along the line exceeded their September task by 0.7 percent, earning them a red flag from the Signal Engineering Company of the Ministry of Railways.

    为保证中、苏、蒙三国铁路能够按期通车联运，修建集二铁路的职工们，正紧张进行结尾工程。原是牛羊吃草、居民赛马的集宁北部广场，现在已经建筑成为我国最大最新式的车站之一。目前工人正在铺油毡，安装机器，建筑客车换装所，争取工程圆满结尾。在新建成的我国陆地口岸——二连，建筑工人在油漆房子，安装玻璃，架设电线，补窟窿修角；给水队工人在水道的弯头地方安插水道标，爬在水塔顶上涂抹防水胶泥。铁道部第三工程局第三段一工区的筑路工人正在整修路基、桥涵。在坝王河桥附近的第二段八工区，筑路工人们整修的工程有四百多项，他们起道的起道，扳螺丝的扳螺丝，抬碴填土，三天的任务，两天半就完成了。在集二路沿线雪害严重地方，已建立了一排排防雪栅栏。在沿线各车站安装苏联新式信号的工人们，九月份超额完成任务百分之零点七，得到了铁道部信号工程公司的一面红旗。
