　　Suggest Appropriately Developing Dairy Goats in Agricultural Cooperatives in Suburban Areas

Editor:

　　In our country's first Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy, it was proposed to appropriately develop dairy cows near cities and industrial areas. This demonstrates the Party and the government's concern for the people's health. However, judging from the situation in various cities and industrial areas, the supply of fresh milk is far from meeting the needs of the people, and even cannot meet the needs of infants and patients. Therefore, I believe that in addition to appropriately developing dairy cows near cities and industrial areas, we should promote the development of dairy goats.

　　Goat milk tastes good, is nutritious, and is easily digested, making it a good food for infants and patients with gastrointestinal diseases. If dairy goats are well-fed and managed, not only is the milk production high, but the lactation period is also very long. Generally, goats can be milked for nine to eleven months after giving birth, during which they can produce more than 2,000 jin of milk, which is equivalent to one-quarter to one-half of the milk production of ordinary dairy cows. Goats generally give birth to two or three kids per litter, and the kids grow quickly. They can be bred after ten to twelve months, and after another five months, they will give birth to kids and begin supplying milk.

　　Goats are gentle in nature, and women and children can take on the task of feeding and managing them. The cost of feeding goats is very low. The feed required to raise one cow can raise six to eight goats, and various leaves and unsaleable vegetables and fruits can be used as feed. Raising goats does not require large barns or large pastures. Empty spaces next to houses and sloping areas next to country roads can be used for grazing.

　　In addition, goat manure is also a very good fertilizer for orchards and vegetable gardens, and its fertilizer effect is much greater than that of cow and horse manure.

　　The above situation shows that if agricultural production cooperatives in suburban areas raise dairy goats, they can not only supply goat milk to the urban population, but also increase sideline income. I hope that agricultural production cooperatives with the conditions will raise dairy goats.

### 建议城市郊区的农业社适当发展乳用山羊

　　建议城市郊区的农业社适当发展乳用山羊编辑同志：
    在我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划中，提出要在城市和工业区的附近适当地发展奶牛，这说明党和政府对待人民健康的关心。但是，根据各城市和工业区的情况看来，鲜乳的供应还远远赶不上人民的需要，甚至不能满足婴儿和病人的要求；因此我认为在城市和工业区附近，除了适当地发展奶牛以外，应该提倡发展乳用山羊。
    山羊乳味美而富有营养，并且容易消化，对于婴儿和胃肠病患者是一种很好的食品。乳用山羊如果饲养管理得好，不但产乳量高，而且泌乳期也很长。一般山羊在生产后可以挤乳九个月到十一个月，在这期间能得乳二千市斤以上，相当于普通乳牛产量的四分之一至二分之一。山羊一般每胎生产两只或三只仔羊，仔羊成长很快，在十个月到十二个月后，就可以配种，再经过五个月就生产小羊，并开始供应饮奶。
    山羊性情温和，妇女、儿童都可以担任饲养和管理工作。喂养山羊所需的费用很少，养一头牛所需的饲料可以养山羊六头到八头，还可利用各种树叶和不宜出售的蔬菜、瓜果作为饲料。养山羊不需要大的畜舍，也不需要大的牧草场，宅院旁边的空地、乡间小路旁边倾斜地方都可以放牧。
    此外，羊粪还是果园和菜园里的一种很好的肥料，它的肥效比牛粪和马粪大得多。
    以上情况说明，城市郊区的农业生产合作社如果饲养乳羊，不但可以把羊乳供应城市人民，而且可以增加副业收入。希望有条件的农业生产合作社喂养乳用山羊。
