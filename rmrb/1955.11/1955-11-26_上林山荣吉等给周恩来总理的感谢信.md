　　Kamabayashi Eikichi and Others' Letter of Thanks to Premier Zhou Enlai

To His Excellency Premier Zhou Enlai:

　　We, the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China, were invited by Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Secretary-General Peng Zhen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of your esteemed country to visit China. During our visit, we received meticulous care in all aspects, whether it was the National Day ceremony, inspections of various places, or meetings with important figures. This is something that all members deeply appreciate.

　　During our visit to your esteemed country, we personally witnessed the rapid development of New China and listened to the government leaders, headed by Chairman Mao, talk about the practical situation that is extremely beneficial to Japan-China friendship and their opinions on the future. What is especially fortunate for both countries is that we have clearly written mutually beneficial matters into the joint communique. We believe that both countries should understand each other's positions in the future, strengthen friendly relations, and contribute to genuine peace. This would be glorious for both sides.

　　Finally, we respectfully wish your country great development and all its people happiness, and we wish Chairman Mao, you, and all the important figures we have met good health.

Respectfully,
Kamabayashi Eikichi, Head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China

(Signed by all members and staff)

　　上林山荣吉等给周恩来总理的感谢信周恩来总理阁下：
    谨陈者，此次，我们日本国会议员访华团应贵国全国人民代表大会常务委员会刘少奇委员长和彭真秘书长的邀请访问贵国。在访问期间，不论国庆节观礼、考察各地和要人会见等各个方面都受到无微不至的关照，这是全体人员所深深感谢的。
    我们一行在访问贵国期间，亲眼看见了新中国突飞猛进的发展，并倾听了以毛主席为首的政府各位要人谈到对日中友好极有裨益的实际情况和对今后的意见。尤其值得为两国庆幸的是我们已把相互有利的事项明确地写在联合公报之中。我们相信今后两国应该了解彼此的立场，加强友好关系，并为真正的和平有所贡献。这对彼此双方都是光荣的。
    最后，敬祝贵国的巨大发展和全体人民的幸福，并祝毛主席和您以及曾经见过的各位要人的健康。日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉敬白（以下全体团员及随员连名）
            一九五五年十一月十一日
