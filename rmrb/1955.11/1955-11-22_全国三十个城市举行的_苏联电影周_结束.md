　　The "Soviet Film Week" held in thirty cities nationwide concluded on the 21st. According to incomplete statistics from twenty-four cities across the country alone, the number of viewers during Film Week reached over 6,880,000. This figure only represents the audience numbers in these twenty-four cities from the start of Film Week until various dates ranging from the 18th to the 21st, across over two hundred cinemas screening more than twelve thousand four hundred and fifty film showings. To satisfy the demands of the vast audience, many cities will continue to screen the films from Film Week.

　　During Film Week, the audience attendance rate at cinemas in various locations showed a significant increase. The Workers' Cultural Palace in Qiqihar City averaged only 20,000 viewers per month from January to mid-June 1955, while during these two weeks, the total reached over 35,000. In cities such as Hohhot, Wuhan, Hangzhou, and Xi'an, many farmers, women, and students from the suburbs also traveled from afar to watch Soviet films. In the suburbs of Xi'an, some women watched the film "Marina's Destiny" four times. In Qingdao City, to meet the enthusiastic demand of mothers with children to watch movies, many cinemas specially scheduled "Mother and Baby Screenings" every day in the later stages of Film Week. In Jinan City, during the recent week when the film "Cultivating Courage" was screened, five cinemas organized "Children's Screenings," attracting 27,000 viewers.

　　After watching Soviet films, the broad masses of workers, peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, government employees, citizens, women, and young students in various locations held discussion meetings. Various film lectures, written discussion meetings, report meetings, receptions, and exhibitions were also held in various locations during Film Week.

　　Seven cities and counties in Zhejiang Province, including Ningbo, Wenzhou, Shaoxing, and Jiaxing, which did not participate in Film Week, and eight cities in Henan Province, including Kaifeng and Luoyang, also held Soviet film exhibitions during this period. From the 21st to the 30th, six cities in Liaoning Province, including Benxi, Andong, Jinzhou, Fuxin, Liaoyang, and Yingkou, will also hold such Soviet film exhibitions.

　　全国三十个城市举行的“苏联电影周”结束
    在全国三十个城市举行的“苏联电影周”已在二十一日结束。仅据全国二十四个城市的不完全统计，电影周的观众数已达六百八十八万多人次。这还只是这二十四个城市从电影周开始分别截至十八日到二十一日止，在近二百家电影院放映的一万二千四百五十多场电影时所拥有的观众数。为了满足广大观众的要求，许多城市将继续放映电影周中的各影片。
    在电影周中，各地电影院的观众上座率有了显著增长。齐齐哈尔市的工人文化宫在一九五五年一月至六月中，平均每月观众仅两万人，而这次两周中共达三万五千多人。在呼和浩特、武汉、杭州、西安等市，郊区的许多农民、妇女和学生还从远处赶来观看苏联电影。西安市郊区有些妇女把影片
    “玛利娜的命运”看了四遍。青岛市许多电影院为了满足带孩子的妈妈看电影的热烈要求，在电影周的后期每天还特设了“妇婴场”。济南市在最近一周上映影片“培养勇敢精神”的时候，有五家影院组织了“儿童场”，观众达二万七千人。
    各地广大职工、农民、解放军战士、机关工作者、市民、妇女和青年学生在观看苏联影片后，纷纷举行座谈会。各地还在电影周中分别举行了许多次电影讲座、笔谈会、报告会、招待会和展览会。
    未参加电影周的浙江省宁波、温州、绍兴、嘉兴等七个市、县和河南省开封、洛阳等八个城市，在这一期间也举办了苏联电影展览。从二十一日到三十日，辽宁省本溪、安东、锦州、阜新、辽阳、营口等六个城市也将举行这种苏联影片展览。
