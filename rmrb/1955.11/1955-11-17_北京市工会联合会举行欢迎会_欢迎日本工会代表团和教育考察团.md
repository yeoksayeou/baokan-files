Xinhua News Agency, 15th -- The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions held a reception on the 15th to welcome the entire Japanese trade union delegation headed by Fujita Tohtaro, vice-leader of the Japan "National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution" visiting delegation, leader of the Japanese Trade Union Delegation, and chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, and the entire Japanese Teachers and Staff Union Educational Study Group headed by Kobayashi Takeshi. Chida Koreya, a member of the Japan "National Federation for the Defense of the Constitution" visiting delegation and head of the "Haiyuza" theater troupe, and Kaneko Kenta, a Japanese trade union worker in Beijing, were also invited to attend the reception.

　　Wang Jiong, vice-chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, first expressed welcome to the Japanese guests from afar on behalf of all the workers in Beijing at the reception. He said that in recent years, the friendly exchanges between trade unions of China and Japan have made significant progress. In 1955 alone, trade union organizations at all levels in Beijing have had the honor of receiving visits from many Japanese trade union workers, which has further developed the friendship between the workers of our two countries. We believe that the members of the delegation will definitely convey our friendly wishes to the Japanese workers and all the people to the Japanese workers and people.

　　Fujita Tohtaro expressed his gratitude for the warm welcome from the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions in his speech. He said that today, we are spending this evening with our Chinese worker brothers, and nothing could make us happier than this. This visit will further promote the friendship and understanding between the workers of our two countries. Fujita Tohtaro concluded by saying, let the workers of China and Japan live a happy life as soon as possible, and let us join hands in a peaceful world!

　　Kobayashi Takeshi then spoke, saying that we have conducted visits in your country under your friendly care and assistance. We are teachers, and we want to educate the thousands of children around us to get along well with the children of China. We believe that our struggle is not isolated, because you are next to us.

　　The Beijing Workers' Amateur Song and Dance Troupe performed wonderful programs at the reception.

　　Among those present at today's reception were Lai Ruoyu, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions; Liu Ningyi, vice-chairman; Zhang Xiuzhu, secretary of the Secretariat; Fang Ming, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Educational Trade Union; Wang Jiong and Peng Siming, vice-chairmen of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions; Hou Decheng, Zhang Baifa, Cheng Yongxiang, and Luo Shuzhen, industrial labor models of Beijing; heads of various departments of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions; heads of national and Beijing industrial trade unions; and responsible persons of trade unions at all levels in Beijing and workers from factories and mining enterprises in Beijing, totaling more than 1,800 people.
