The Soviet Union's Abundant Agricultural Harvest

This Year's Grain Harvest Greatly Exceeds Previous Years

    This year, the Soviet Union's total grain harvest greatly exceeds previous years. As of November 1st, the nation's grain procurement volume has exceeded last year's by 129 million poods (1 pood equals 32.76 jin). Many regions have delivered more grain to the state than originally planned.

    In the Russian Federation, the grain harvest in Moscow, Lisen, and Stalingrad regions this year is 50% to more than double that of last year. Some collective farms and state farms have increased their grain and marketable grain production by two and a half times compared to last year, and have delivered more than double the planned amount of grain to the state.

    The Ukrainian Republic, known as the granary of the Soviet Union, has had a grain harvest this year that is even better than 1952, which had the best harvest in recent years. The collective farms and state farms throughout the republic have delivered 150 million poods of grain to the state in excess of the plan this year.

    In the Kazakh Republic, a major reclamation area in the Soviet Union, although the climatic conditions this year were not very good, some collective farms and state farms, due to expanding the sown area by reclaiming wasteland, still had a larger total grain harvest than in previous years.

Sugar Beet Harvest Exceeds Highest Historical Level

    Judging from the progress of the sugar beet harvest throughout the Soviet Union, the total sugar beet harvest this year is expected to exceed the highest historical level. As of the beginning of November, the sugar beets supplied by the collective farms alone to the nation's more than 200 sugar refineries were more than 40% higher than in the same period last year, and the sugar content of the beet roots has also increased compared to the past.

    In the Ukrainian Republic, the Soviet Union's main sugar beet production area, several thousand collective farm sugar beet planting teams harvested 250 to 270 quintals (1 quintal equals 200 jin) of sugar beets per hectare (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of land this year. The Moldavian Republic has an even better harvest, with sugar beet production this year nearly doubling that of last year, and particularly good collective farms even harvesting over 1,000 quintals.

    Sugar beet is the most important raw material for the Soviet sugar industry. The Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of both the development of sugar beet cultivation and the production of beet sugar.

Maltsev's Tillage Method Improves Yields

    In the Soviet Union, the total area of land cultivated using the famous Maltsev tillage method has reached 4.5 million hectares this year. Judging from this year's harvest, the crop yield per unit area of land cultivated using this advanced method is generally higher than that of land cultivated using ordinary methods.

    The Maltsev tillage method stipulates that the land should be deeply ploughed to 40 to 60 centimeters using a plow without a moldboard, and after that, no further ploughing is required for three to four consecutive years, and only shallow tillage and loosening of the soil is carried out during sowing. Last autumn, the Kazakh Republic deeply ploughed tens of thousands of hectares of autumn fields using plows without moldboards according to this method. A recent summary made by the Kazakh Branch of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences proves that, despite the drought in Kazakhstan this year, the grain yield per unit area of these lands is still higher than that of lands cultivated using the old method; some collective farms harvested wheat from these lands that averaged even half to one times more per hectare than ordinary land.

### 苏联农业的丰收

    苏联农业的丰收
    今年谷物收获量大大超过往年
    今年苏联的谷物总收获量大大超过往年。截至十一月一日为止，全国的粮食征购量已经比去年多一亿二千九百万普特（一普特合三十二点七六市斤）。许多地区交售给国家的谷物都超过了原订的计划。
    在俄罗斯联邦，莫斯科、利森和斯大林格勒州今年的谷物收获量比去年多百分之五十到两倍以上。有些集体农庄和国营农场今年生产的谷物和商品谷物增加到了去年的两倍半，向国家交售的谷物超过计划一倍。
    以苏联的谷仓闻名的乌克兰共和国今年谷物的收成比过去几年中收成最好的一九五二年还要好。全共和国的集体农庄和国营农场今年超计划向国家交售的谷物达到了一亿五千万普特。
    在苏联主要开垦地区哈萨克共和国，虽然今年的气候条件很不好，但是，若干集体农庄和国营农场由于开垦荒地扩大播种面积，谷物总收获量仍然比往年多。
    甜菜收获量超过历年最高水平
    根据苏联各地的甜菜收获工作的进展情况看来，今年苏联甜菜的总收获量预计将超过历年来的最高水平。到十一月初，单是各集体农庄供给全国两百多个制糖厂的甜菜，就比去年同期多百分之四十以上，甜菜块根的含糖量也比过去增加了。
    苏联的主要甜菜产区乌克兰共和国有几千个集体农庄的甜菜种植小组今年从每公顷（合十五市亩）土地上收获了二百五十到二百七十公担（每公担合二百市斤）的甜菜。摩尔达维亚共和国的收成更好，今年这里甜菜的生产将近增加到去年的两倍，特别好的集体农庄甚至收获了一千公担以上。
    甜菜是苏联制糖工业最重要的原料。无论就甜菜种植业的发展或者甜菜糖的生产来说，苏联都占世界第一位。
    马尔采夫耕作法提高了产量
    在苏联，用著名的马尔采夫耕作法耕作的土地的总面积在今年已经达到四百五十万公顷。从今年的收成看来，凡是用这种先进方法耕作的土地，其农作物单位面积产量一般都比用普通方法耕作的土地高。
    马尔采夫耕作法规定，用不带犁壁的犁深耕土地到四十至六十公分，此后一连三、四年，就不用再翻耕，播种时只进行浅耕松土。去年秋季，哈萨克共和国按照这种方法用不带犁壁的犁深耕了好几万公顷的秋田。全苏列宁农业科学院哈萨克分院最近作出的总结证明，尽管今年哈萨克的气候干旱，但是这些土地的谷物单位面积产量仍然比用老办法耕作的土地为高；一些集体农庄从这些土地上收获的小麦，平均每公顷甚至比一般土地多半倍到一倍。
