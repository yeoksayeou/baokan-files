Shandong's state-owned construction enterprises have generally reduced construction project costs in the second half of this year. The new project cost standards formulated by the Shandong Provincial People's Committee are 26% lower than the original costs. For example, the original design cost for the ward building of the Veterans' Sanatorium was 115 yuan per square meter, and the dormitory building was 70 yuan per square meter. After redesigning and removing unnecessary decorations, and converting the dormitory building into a one-story building, the cost for the ward building is only 80 yuan per square meter, and the dormitory is only 35 yuan per square meter. The thirteen construction projects designed by the Provincial Engineering Bureau alone saved the state 2.1 million yuan.

The vast number of employees in the construction enterprise sector often pay attention to saving materials and labor, and reducing investment in temporary projects, which has also powerfully guaranteed the reduction of project costs. For example, the 10th construction site of the Qingdao Construction Engineering Company saved 556 labor days in August alone, and the savings value of only brick, lime, sand, and stone materials reached 437 yuan. According to incomplete statistics, the entire province saved the state more than 2.6 million yuan in the second half of this year through cost reduction and disposal of stagnant materials.

　　山东建筑企业降低工程造价
    山东省国营建筑企业今年下半年建筑工程造价普遍降低。省人民委员会制定的新的工程造价标准，比原来造价降低百分之二十六。如荣军疗养院病房大楼原设计每平方公尺一百十五元，宿舍楼房每平方公尺七十元，经过重新设计，去掉不必要的装饰，宿舍楼房改成平房后，病房大楼每平方公尺八十元，宿舍每平方公尺三十五元就足够了。仅省工程局设计的十三项建筑工程，即为国家节约二百一十万元。
    建筑企业部门的广大职工，经常注意节约材料、人工和减少暂设工程的投资，也有力地保证了工程造价的降低。如青岛建筑工程公司第十工地，八月份一个月就节约人工五百五十六个，仅砖、灰、砂、石四项材料的节约价值即达四百三十七元。全省据不完全的统计，今年下半年降低成本、处理呆滞材料等方面，共为国家节约了二百六十多万元。　（本报驻济南记者）
