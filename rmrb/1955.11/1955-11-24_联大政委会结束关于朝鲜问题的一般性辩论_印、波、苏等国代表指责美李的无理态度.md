Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 22nd: The Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly concluded its general debate on the Korean question at its afternoon session on the 21st.

　　Indian representative Menon made a lengthy speech. Addressing the argument that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's disagreement to hold "free elections" is the obstacle to the unification of Korea, Menon emphasized that the actual disagreement does not lie in the issue of free elections, but in the election supervisory body. He criticized the United States' attitude that the Korean question can only be resolved by accepting conditions that supposedly conform to "United Nations principles."

　　Menon emphasized the importance of maintaining and implementing the armistice agreement, and he denounced the aggressive rhetoric of the Syngman Rhee group against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. He reminded the committee that the South Korean authorities are openly clamoring to destroy the armistice, to use force to obstruct the unification of Korea, and have issued an ultimatum to the members of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, demanding that they leave South Korea. Menon said that all these facts are not consistent with the claim that there are conditions for truly free elections in South Korea.

　　Menon advocated for the United Nations to call on both Korean sides to establish mutual contact. He called on all member states of the United Nations to abandon ultimatum-style wording and to abandon attempts to resolve the Korean question by forcing one side to accept the will of the other. He emphasized that the Indian delegation opposes the proposal put forward by the United States delegation precisely because this proposal reflects this intention of unilateral decision.

　　Although Menon was the last speaker according to the speaking list, the representative of the Syngman Rhee government and the representative of the United States once again made lengthy speeches under the pretext of responding to the opinions of other countries' representatives. The South Korean representative defended the South Korean authorities' behavior of undermining the armistice, saying that his government had opposed the armistice from the beginning. U.S. representative Broustein repeated the clichés slandering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China in his speech. He also attempted to justify the South Korean authorities' provocative behavior against the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission.

　　Polish representative Katz-Suchy pointed out in response to the U.S. representative's speech that certain facts confirmed by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, composed of representatives from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Switzerland, had been distorted by the U.S. representative. Katz-Suchy emphasized that the U.S. representative's attitude and the rude tone he used in his speech added to the difficulties in resolving the Korean question.

　　At the end of the meeting, Soviet representative Malik expressed his opinion on the U.S. representative's speech. He requested that the Political Committee note that the speeches made by the U.S. representative and the South Korean representative against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China were all delivered in the absence of representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. This was more convenient for the U.S. representative, but it did not make his speech convincing.

### 联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题的一般性辩论　印、波、苏等国代表指责美李的无理态度

　　联大政委会结束关于朝鲜问题的一般性辩论
　　印、波、苏等国代表指责美李的无理态度
    新华社二十三日讯　据塔斯社纽约二十二日讯：联合国大会政治委员会二十一日下午会议结束了对朝鲜问题的一般性辩论。
    印度代表梅农作了长篇发言。针对着那种硬说朝鲜民主主义人民共和国不同意举行“自由选举”是统一朝鲜的障碍的论调，梅农强调说，实际上，分歧并不在于自由选举的问题上，而在于选举的监督机构方面。他批评了美国这样一种态度，就是只有接受所谓符合“联合国原则”的条件，朝鲜问题才能够得到解决。
    梅农强调指出维护和执行停战协定的重要性，他斥责李承晚集团对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国发出的侵略性的言论。他提醒委员会注意南朝鲜当局公开在叫嚣要破坏停战，要用武力阻挠朝鲜的统一，并且对中立国监察委员会委员提出了最后通牒，要他们离开南朝鲜。梅农说，所有这一些事实同所谓在南朝鲜具备进行真正自由选举的条件这种说法是不相符合的。
    梅农主张由联合国呼吁朝鲜双方建立相互接触。他要求联合国所有会员国放弃最后通牒式的措词，并且放弃以强使一方接受另一方的意志的办法来解决朝鲜问题的企图。他强调指出，印度代表团所以反对美国代表团提出的提案，就是因为这个提案反映了这种片面决定的意图。
    虽然按照发言名单，梅农是最后一个发言人，但是李承晚政府的代表和美国代表却借口回答别国代表的意见再一次作了长篇发言。南朝鲜代表为南朝鲜当局破坏停战的行为辩护说，他的政府从一开头就反对停战。美国代表布劳斯坦在发言中重复诬蔑朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的那些陈词滥调。他还企图为南朝鲜当局对中立国监察委员会所作的挑衅行为辩解。
    波兰代表卡茨—苏希在回答美国代表的发言时指出，由波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、瑞典和瑞士四国代表组成的中立国监察委员会所确认的某些事实被美国代表歪曲了。卡茨—苏希强调指出美国代表的态度和他在发言时的粗鲁语气给朝鲜问题的解决增加了困难。
    在会议的最后，苏联代表马立克就美国代表的发言表示了意见。他要求政治委员会注意，美国代表和南朝鲜代表所作的反对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的发言，全都是在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国代表不在场的情况下发表的。这样做对美国代表说来是比较方便的，但这样也没有能使他的发言有说服力。
