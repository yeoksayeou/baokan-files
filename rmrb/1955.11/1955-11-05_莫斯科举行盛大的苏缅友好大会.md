Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 4th: A grand Soviet-Burmese friendship rally was held on November 3rd in the Pillar Hall of the Trade Union Building in Moscow. More than two thousand workers, scientists, cultural workers, and students from Moscow attended the meeting. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union and the Burmese government procurement delegation were also invited to participate.

Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Bulganin, Kaganovich, Malenkov, Mikoyan, Pervukhin, Saburov, Khrushchev, Aristov, Pospelov, Shepilov, and others sat on the presidium, at which time all those present gave a warm cheer.

The meeting was presided over by Yasnov, Chairman of the Moscow Soviet. On behalf of the people of Moscow, he expressed his heartfelt respect to the outstanding representative of the Burmese people, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu, and expressed the warm respect of the people of Moscow for the Burmese people.

Subsequently, Prime Minister U Nu spoke at the meeting. He first expressed his views on world peace, easing tensions, and further consolidating the friendship between the Soviet Union and Burma. He said: Since the middle of last year, I have visited many countries. In every country I have visited, leaders and people have the same attitude towards peace. In the Soviet Union, I also met with leaders and people, and I also found that they were united in their desire for peace. The whole world is in favor of peace, but its efforts to seek peace still encounter obstacles. No one can deny that deep-seated fear and mutual suspicion exist in the world today. This makes the search for peace particularly difficult. As long as this fear and suspicion exist, peaceful coexistence will lose its meaning. Therefore, all parties concerned must take sincere efforts to eliminate this fear and suspicion. I believe that high-level negotiations and disarmament alone cannot achieve world peace. All possible steps should also be taken to achieve closer personal contact between the peoples of all countries.

Prime Minister U Nu then talked about his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union. He said that he felt that the Soviet people were very friendly and hospitable. Cultural work is given great importance and has become an integral feature of Soviet life. The care for children and young men and women is very prominent. Great importance is attached to the work of teaching science in schools and specialized schools. The Soviet people are truly developing a high degree of technological civilization.

U Nu finally expressed his prayer for world peace, for the further elimination of international suspicion, and for the establishment of closer contacts between countries. He also stated that Burma will unite with the Soviet Union in the common desire to fight for the independence of colonies and in the common effort to fight for world peace.

Subsequently, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers Bulganin spoke.

Bulganin said: The Soviet government welcomes the leader of the Burmese government, U Nu, to our country. The arrival of Prime Minister U Nu reminds us of the tremendous changes taking place in the countries of the East today. For centuries, the peoples of the ancient Asian countries, who have made significant contributions to world civilization, have suffered brutal colonial oppression and have been in a state of poverty and backwardness. This dark period in the lives of the peoples of the East is now becoming a thing of the past. We are witnessing the peoples of the East becoming active builders of a new life. The words of the great Lenin that the peoples of these countries are beginning to participate in determining the fate of the whole world are becoming a reality.

Bulganin said that the relations between the Soviet Union and Burma have never been hampered by contradictions. The relations between the Soviet Union and Burma are based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The friendship and business contacts between the Burmese and Soviet peoples have recently been steadily developing and strengthening. Prime Minister U Nu's visit to Moscow and his direct understanding of the country's economic and cultural achievements and the daily lives of the Soviet people will help further develop economic, technological and cultural cooperation between our two countries. The personal contact we have established in Moscow will continue.

Bulganin then expressed his acceptance of Prime Minister U Nu's recent invitation to him and Khrushchev to visit Burma.

Bulganin continued: The Geneva Conference of the Heads of Government of the Four Powers eased international tensions and struck a blow at the so-called "Cold War." This conference marked the beginning of a new stage in international relations. It showed that international cooperation in the interests of peace is entirely possible in our time, and that building trust between countries is a realistic and achievable goal. The Soviet government has taken a series of important concrete measures in the past three months to promote further easing of tensions and consolidation of trust in relations between countries, and to create favorable conditions for the success of the work of the Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers. We have done and continue to do everything in our power to enable the Foreign Ministers to make unanimous decisions on the issues discussed by the Heads of Government. If all parties participating in the Foreign Ministers' Conference abide by the spirit of cooperation that permeated the Heads of Government Conference, then the conference will produce positive results.

Bulganin finally expressed the hope that the friendship between the Soviet Union and Burma will be further strengthened for the benefit of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Burma, and for the benefit of world peace and security.

After the speech, Bulganin and U Nu shook hands cordially. Cheers erupted from the venue, and people shouted: "Long live the friendship between the Soviet and Burmese peoples! Hurrah!"

After the meeting, an art performance was held, with famous Soviet actors performing wonderful programs.

    莫斯科举行盛大的苏缅友好大会
    新华社四日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：十一月三日，在莫斯科工会大厦圆柱大厅中举行了盛大的苏缅友好大会。参加会议的有莫斯科的工人、科学家、文化工作者和学生两千多人。各国驻苏联的外交使节和缅甸政府采购代表团也应邀参加了大会。
    缅甸联邦总理吴努、苏联共产党和政府的领导人布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、马林科夫、米高扬、别尔乌辛、萨布罗夫、赫鲁晓夫、阿里斯托夫、波斯伯洛夫、谢皮洛夫等在主席团的席位上就座，这时，全体到会者热烈欢呼。
    大会由莫斯科市苏维埃主席雅斯诺夫主持。他代表莫斯科人向缅甸人民的杰出代表、缅甸联邦总理吴努致衷心的敬意，并且表达了莫斯科人对缅甸人民的热烈敬意。
    接着，吴努总理在会上讲话。他首先就世界和平、缓和紧张局势和进一步巩固苏缅两国的友谊联系问题发表了意见。他说：从去年年中起，我访问了许多国家。在我所访问过的每一个国家中，领导人和人民都对和平抱同样的态度。在苏联，我也同领导人和人民相会，我也发现他们在渴望和平方面是一致的。整个世界都拥护和平，可是它寻求和平的努力仍然碰到障碍。谁也不能否认：今天世界上存在着根深蒂固的恐惧和相互猜疑。这使寻求和平遭到格外的困难。只要这种恐惧和猜疑存在，和平共处就会丧失意义。因此，一切有关方面必须采取真诚的努力来消除这种恐惧和猜疑。我认为，单靠高级谈判和裁军还不能达到建立世界和平。还应当采取一切可能的步骤，以便达到各国人民之间的更加密切的个人接触。
    吴努总理接着谈到了他这次访问苏联所获得的印象。他说，我感到苏联人民是非常友善和好客的。文化工作受到了很大的重视，并且成了苏联生活不可分割的特征。对儿童和青年男女的关怀是非常突出的。在学校和专科学校中教授科学的工作受到极大的重视。苏联人民正在真正发展着高度的技术文明。
    吴努最后表示为世界和平、为国际猜疑的进一步消除、为国和国之间建立更加密切的接触而祈祷。他还表示在争取殖民地的独立的共同愿望中，在争取世界和平的共同努力中，缅甸将同苏联团结一致。
    随后，由苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁讲话。
    布尔加宁说：苏联政府欢迎缅甸政府领袖吴努到我们国家来。吴努总理的到来，使我们想起了今天东方国家正在发生着的巨大变化。几世纪来，对世界文明作了重大贡献的古老的亚洲各国人民受到了残酷的殖民压迫，处于贫困和落后状态之中。东方各国人民生活中的这个黑暗时期目前正在成为过去。我们亲眼看到东方各国人民正在成为新生活的积极的建造者。伟大的列宁所说的这些国家的人民正在开始参与决定全世界的命运这句话，正在成为事实。
    布尔加宁说，苏联和缅甸之间的关系从来没有受到矛盾的妨害。苏联和缅甸的关系是建立在相互尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处的原则之上的。缅甸人民和苏联人民之间的友谊和事务性接触最近已经得到了稳步的发展和加强。缅甸总理吴努这次到莫斯科来，他对这个国家的经济和文化成就以及对苏联人民日常生活的直接了解，将有助于进一步发展我们两国间的经济、技术和文化合作。我们在莫斯科所建立的个人接触将继续下去。
    布尔加宁接着表示接受吴努总理最近提出的约请他和赫鲁晓夫访问缅甸的邀请。
    布尔加宁接着说：四国政府首脑日内瓦会议缓和了国际紧张局势，打击了所谓“冷战”。这次会议标志着国际关系中一个新阶段的开始。它表明根据和平的利益进行国际合作在我们的时代是完全可能的，在国和国之间建立信任是现实的、可以达到的目标。苏联政府在过去三个月中采取了一系列重要的具体措施，以促进紧张局势的进一步缓和和各国关系中的信任的巩固，为四国外长会议工作的成功创造有利条件。我们已经并且仍旧继续在尽我们的一切力量，以便使外长们能够在政府首脑们所讨论的问题上作出一致同意的决定。如果参加外长会议的一切方面遵守政府首脑会议上洋溢的合作精神，那末会议将产生积极的结果。
    布尔加宁最后表示希望，为了苏缅两国人民的利益，为了世界和平和安全的利益，进一步加强苏联和缅甸的友谊。
    讲话结束后，布尔加宁和吴努亲切地握手。会场上响起了一片欢呼声，人们高呼：“苏联人民和缅甸人民之间的友谊万岁！乌拉！”
    会后，举行了艺术表演会，由苏联著名的演员演出精采节目。
