Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 19th (TASS dispatch): Kuznetsov, head of the Soviet delegation attending the tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly, issued a statement at a press conference on November 17th regarding the admission of new member states to the United Nations. He stated that the United Nations General Assembly will soon discuss the long-standing issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations. Eighteen countries have applied to join the United Nations: Albania, the Mongolian People's Republic, Jordan, Ireland, Portugal, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Romania, Bulgaria, Finland, Ceylon, Nepal, Libya, Cambodia, Japan, Laos, and Spain. The delegations of most countries attending the General Assembly support the Canadian proposal, put forward during consultations with various delegations, to admit all eighteen countries as members of the United Nations at this session.

Kuznetsov's statement said: The Soviet Union has in the past and continues to advocate the most rapid resolution of the issue of admitting new member states. From this standpoint, the Soviet government fully supports the Canadian proposal.

Kuznetsov pointed out: It can be seen from the statement made by the US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, on November 13th, that the United States does not intend to support the proposal to admit all eighteen countries to the United Nations because the United States does not like the political and social systems of some of these countries. This attitude is clearly contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. It is precisely this attitude of the United States that has consistently hindered the resolution of the issue of admitting new member states in the past.

Kuznetsov said: The Soviet Union believes that resolutions by the Security Council and the United Nations General Assembly on admitting eighteen countries with different political and social systems to the United Nations would be an important step in the cause of developing international cooperation and consolidating universal peace. At the same time, this resolution would greatly help enhance the prestige of the United Nations.

In response to questions raised by reporters, Kuznetsov stated that the Soviet delegation would vote in favor of admitting the eighteen countries to the United Nations on the condition that all eighteen countries are admitted as members of the United Nations. He emphasized that the Soviet delegation would firmly reject any other proposals. The Soviet delegation absolutely disagrees with postponing the discussion of the issue of the Mongolian People's Republic joining the United Nations.

　　苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫
　　就联合国接纳新会员国问题发表声明
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社纽约十九日讯：出席联合国大会第十届会议的苏联代表团团长库兹涅佐夫十七日在记者招待会上就联合国接纳新会员国的问题发表声明说，联合国大会最近就要讨论多年来悬而未决的接纳新会员国进入联合国的问题，申请加入联合国的有十八个国家，它们是：阿尔巴尼亚、蒙古人民共和国、约旦、爱尔兰、葡萄牙、匈牙利、意大利、奥地利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、芬兰、锡兰、尼泊尔、利比亚、柬埔寨、日本、老挝和西班牙。出席大会的大多数国家的代表团都主张大会通过加拿大在同各国代表团会谈的时候提出的关于在本届会议上接纳所有上述十八个国家为联合国会员国的建议。
    库兹涅佐夫的声明说：苏联在过去和现在都是主张最迅速地解决接纳新会员国的问题。从这一点出发，苏联政府完全支持加拿大的建议。
    库兹涅佐夫指出：从美国驻联合国代表洛奇十一月十三日的声明可以看出，美国不打算支持关于接纳上述所有的十八个国家加入联合国的建议，因为美国不喜欢其中某些国家的政治和社会制度。这种态度显然是违反联合国的宗旨和原则的。就是美国这种态度在过去一直阻挠着接纳新会员国问题的解决。
    库兹涅佐夫说：苏联认为，安全理事会和联合国大会关于接纳政治和社会制度不同的十八个国家进入联合国的决议将会是在发展国际合作和巩固普遍和平的事业中的一个重要步骤。同时这个决议在很大程度上会有助于提高联合国的威信。
    库兹涅佐夫在答复记者们提出的一些问题时表示，苏联代表团将在十八个国家全部被接纳为联合国会员国的条件下投票赞成接纳十八个国家进入联合国。他着重指出，苏联代表团将坚决拒绝任何其他的建议。苏联代表团绝对不同意推迟讨论蒙古人民共和国加入联合国的问题。
