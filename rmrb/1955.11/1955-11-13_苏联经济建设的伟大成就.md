The new contributions that the Soviet Union has made in the past year in striving to ease international tensions, striving for peaceful coexistence among nations, and guaranteeing world peace have won universal acclaim from peace-loving people around the world.

People have seen that Moscow is now like a magnetic field, attracting the heads of countries with different social systems to exchange views on peaceful coexistence and collective security.

In addition to many foreign delegations, thousands upon hundreds of foreign tourists are now regularly received in Moscow and throughout the Soviet Union for sightseeing.

The numerous people who visit or travel to the Soviet Union, regardless of their class or party affiliation, have witnessed the Soviet Union's tireless dedication to economic construction and how the Soviet Union has grown stronger and more formidable than ever before in peaceful construction.

Yes, the Soviet people are supporting the peaceful diplomacy of their party and government with selfless labor and enthusiastic construction. The Soviet Union's experience over the years has proven that, just as every achievement of Soviet peaceful diplomacy adds to the favorable factors for world peace and Soviet domestic construction, every achievement of Soviet domestic construction, on the one hand, strengthens the foundation for building a communist society in the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, adds to the guarantee of world peace. Soviet economic construction and Soviet peaceful diplomacy are important contributions the Soviet Union makes to the cause of world peace.

If one recognizes the unprecedented surge in Soviet economic strength after the completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, then it will be self-evident that the great achievements of Soviet economic construction are a fundamental factor in maintaining peace.

The Soviet Union completed the Fifth Five-Year Plan in terms of total industrial output ahead of schedule at the end of April 1955. The task of developing the national economy, and first and foremost the production of the means of production, during the Fifth Five-Year Plan is being overfulfilled, which is a major event of paramount international significance.

Stalin pointed out in his speech at the Moscow Stalin Electoral District voters' meeting on February 9, 1946, that in order to avoid unexpected events, it was necessary to greatly increase the level of industry. At that time, he estimated that after three five-year plans or perhaps more, the level of industry could be increased to three times that of the pre-war level. That is to say, to be much stronger than the economic foundation on which victory was achieved in the anti-fascist Patriotic War. In fact, by 1955, after only two five-year plans, the Soviet Union's industrial level will be more than three times that of the pre-war level. The various departments of heavy industry will also achieve the tasks that Stalin instructed at that time ahead of schedule (of which the petroleum industry has already achieved this). This can be clearly seen from the following table:

|                      | 1940 Output             | 1955 Output                | This Year's Annual Growth | Stalin's Projected Output After Three Five-Year Plans |
|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Pig Iron             | 15 million tons        | Over 33 million tons        | 3 million tons            | 50 million tons                                       |
| Steel                | 18.3 million tons      | 45 million tons             | 3.5 million tons          | 60 million tons                                       |
| Coal                 | 166 million tons       | 390 million tons             | Over 40 million tons       | 500 million tons                                      |
| Petroleum            | 31 million tons        | 70 million tons            |                           |                                                       |

[Note: The Soviet Union's petroleum production increased by 9 million tons in 1954 and 12 million tons in 1955 simply because of the use of peripheral water injection methods in oil formations.]

In completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the Soviet Union continued to implement the policy of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, paying particular attention to the following points:

First, the heart of heavy industry—machine manufacturing—maintained the highest rate of development. Its output in 1955 will be 4.6 times that of 1940. This will guarantee the development and reconstruction of all sectors of the national economy.

Second, there has been a leap forward in electrification. Electricity is the basis for the mechanization and automation of the production process and is the key to improving labor productivity. Metallurgy, machine manufacturing, chemical production, and especially the preparation of materials for the atomic industry, all require a large amount of electricity. The Soviet Union's electricity production in 1955 will reach 166 billion kilowatt-hours, while in 1940 it was only 48.3 billion kilowatt-hours, and in 1913, during the Tsarist Russian era, it was less than 2 billion kilowatt-hours. Many huge hydroelectric power stations with generating capacities ranging from hundreds of thousands of kilowatts to more than two million kilowatts were started or completed during this period. The Soviet Union is now capable of manufacturing steam turbines with a generating capacity of 150,000 kilowatts and will manufacture and design 200,000 and 300,000 kilowatt ones.

Third, the peaceful use of atomic energy and other advanced technologies. In 1954, the Soviet Union established the world's first atomic power station with a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts. Currently, atomic power stations with a generating capacity of 50,000 to 100,000 kilowatts are being built. Radioactive isotopes are widely used to test the production of metallurgy, chemicals, and construction.

Now, the Soviet Union's production of pig iron, steel, coal, and electricity all rank second in the world, while before the October Revolution, Russia's industrial output only ranked fifth in the world. The socialist economic system is incomparably superior to the capitalist economic system. From 1929 to 1954, the Soviet Union's industrial output increased 18 times, while the United States increased only 2.1 times, Britain only 72 percent, France only 14 percent, and Italy only 77 percent. Judging from the speed of Soviet industrial development, the Soviet Union will soon surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of industrial output per capita.

The rapid development of industry and the sharp increase in the people's living standards have led the Soviet Union to raise the issue of further developing agriculture in the third year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. The socialist agriculture of the Soviet Union, consisting of collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state farms, has achieved great success. The consolidation and expansion of collective farms in 1950 strengthened the collective farm system. However, in terms of the speed of development, agriculture had once lagged far behind industry. From 1940 to 1952, calculated at comparable prices, the Soviet Union's industrial output value increased 1.3 times, while agricultural output value increased only 10 percent. In the past two years, under the strengthened leadership of the CPSU Central Committee, due to the efforts of the whole people, and relying on a strong heavy industrial base, Soviet agriculture has achieved great results. In terms of making agriculture more compatible with industry, making the worker-peasant alliance, the foundation of the Soviet regime, more solid, enabling the country to have a more abundant grain reserve, and enabling the people to obtain the richer agricultural products necessary to move towards communism, this result, which is still constantly expanding, is the greatest victory of Soviet agriculture since the overall collectivization.

In the past two years, the development of Soviet agriculture has focused on vigorously increasing the production of "the treasure of treasures," grain, which is solved by grasping the three key factors of opening up wasteland, increasing yields, and widely planting high-yielding grain—corn.

Opening up wasteland is the fastest way to increase grain production. But this requires the support of the broad masses, especially young people, and requires a large amount of capital and machinery. The Soviet Union has these conditions, so it has been able to successfully open up large areas of wasteland in the east. On the formerly desolate wilderness of Siberia and Kazakhstan, more than 400 new giant state farms and many machine tractor stations have appeared. From the spring of 1954 to the end of October 1955, more than 30.01 million hectares (approximately 451.5 million mu) of wasteland were opened up. The wasteland that has been opened up is larger than the wheat sown area of the United States and is more than twice the total wheat sown area of France, French Morocco, Australia, and Argentina. If each hectare yields 50 to 100 poods of grain, then 1.5 billion to 3 billion poods (each pood is equal to 32.76 catties) of grain can be harvested on these 30 million hectares of new land.

Under the socialist system, the potential power of land production is infinite. Due to strengthening organization and leadership, promoting advanced agronomy and experience, the harvest in many regions of the Soviet Union this year reached the highest peak in the Fifth Five-Year Plan. This year, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova, and other 18 states, border regions, and autonomous republics supplied the country with more than 200 million poods of grain above the plan alone.

Corn is still a new crop in many parts of the Soviet Union. This year, a total of 17.9 million hectares were sown in various places, an increase of 13.6 million hectares over last year. This year, the collective farmers of Ukraine made good use of the land and planted twice as much corn, which can yield more than 30 million tons of feed.

The increase in grain production guarantees the progress of the livestock industry. For example, from October 1954 to June 1955, the Soviet Union's milk production increased by 30 percent compared with October 1953 to June 1954, and increased by 55 percent compared with October 1952 to June 1953.

Just like Soviet peaceful diplomacy, the reason why Soviet economic construction has been able to achieve such great achievements is due to the great Soviet people's love of labor, their infinite loyalty to their motherland and the cause of communist construction, and due to the wise leadership of the Soviet Communist Party, which is guided by Leninism. It is precisely relying on the correct leadership of the Soviet Communist Party that the Soviet Union's industry and agriculture are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the various departments of the Soviet national economy are full of vigorous new atmosphere. In January this year, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union called on: strive to achieve an annual output of 10 billion poods of grain in 1956. In July this year, the plenary session of the CPSU Central Committee called on: while completing the national economic plan, make every effort to improve the technical level of production, widely adopt the latest achievements of science and technology, in order to create a new upsurge in industry. These two historically significant decisions pointed out the direction for continued progress. Under these two resounding calls, the Soviet people are moving from victory to new victories!

    苏联经济建设的伟大成就
    李何
    最近一年来，苏联在争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取各国和平共处和保障世界和平的斗争中所作的新的贡献，博得了世界爱好和平的人们的普遍欢呼。
    人们看到了：莫斯科现在如同一座磁力场，吸引着世界不同社会制度的国家的首脑们来这里交换有关和平共处和集体安全的见解。
    除了许许多多外国代表团以外，现在常有成千累百外国旅行家被接待到莫斯科和苏联各地参观游览。
    到苏联作客或旅行的众多人们，不管属于哪个阶层哪个党派，都目击了苏联在孜孜不倦地致力经济建设，苏联在和平建设中成长得从来未有的那样强大，那样不可轻侮。
    是的，苏联人民是以忘我的劳动，热情的建设，为自己的党和政府的和平外交的后盾的。苏联多年来的经验证明：正如苏联和平外交政策的每一分成就，都是为世界和平、为苏联国内建设增加一分有利因素一样；苏联国内建设的每一分成就，一方面为在苏联建设共产主义社会增厚一分基础，另一方面为世界和平加添一分保障。苏联经济建设和苏联和平外交政策，是苏联对于世界和平事业的重要贡献。
    要是认识到苏联经济力量在完成第五个五年计划后空前高涨的情况，那末会不言而喻地理解：苏联经济建设的伟大成就，是维护和平的一个根本因素。
    苏联提前在一九五五年四月底在工业总产量方面完成了第五个五年计划。第五个五年计划的发展国民经济、首先是发展生产资料的生产的任务正在超额地完成，这是具有头等国际意义的大事。
    斯大林在一九四六年二月九日莫斯科斯大林选区选民大会上的演说中曾经指出，为了避免意外事变，必须大大提高工业水平。当时他估计，经过三个五年计划也许更多的时间，可以把工业水平提高为战前的三倍。这就是说，要比在反法西斯的卫国战争中取得胜利的经济基础强大得多。事实上，到一九五五年，仅仅经过两个五年计划的时间，苏联的工业水平将提高为战前的三倍以上。重工业各个部门也将提前实现（其中石油工业已经提前实现）斯大林当时所指示的任务。这从下表看得很清楚：
    一九四○年产量　一九五五年产量　　今年一年增长量　斯大林预计经过三个五年计划后产量生铁　一千五百万吨　三千三百万吨以上  三百万吨  五千万吨钢  一千八百三十万吨  四千五百万吨  三百五十万吨  六千万吨煤  一亿六千六百万吨  三亿九千万吨  四千万吨以上  五亿吨石油  三千一百万吨  七千万吨
　　〔注　　苏联开采的石油，仅仅由于油层采用外围注水方法，在一九五四年就增产石油九百万吨，在一九五五年增产石油一千二百万吨。
    苏联在完成第五个五年计划中，继续贯彻执行了优先发展重工业的方针，特别注意如下几点：
    第一，重工业的心脏——机器制造业保持最高的发展速度。它在一九五五年的产量将为一九四○年的四点六倍。这将保证国民经济各部门的发展和改建。
    第二，电气化方面有飞跃的进步。电力是生产过程的机械化、自动化的基础，是提高劳动生产率的环节。冶金，制造机器，化学生产，尤其是原子工业材料的准备，都需要大量电力。苏联在一九五五年的电力生产将达到一千六百六十亿瓩时，而在一九四○年只有四百八十三亿瓩时，在一九一三年沙皇俄国时代还不到二十亿瓩时。许多发电力从几十万瓩到二百多万瓩的巨大水电站，都是在这个时期动工或完工的。苏联现在能制造十五万瓩发电力的蒸汽透平，并将制造和设计二十万、三十万瓩的。
    第三，和平利用原子能和其他先进的技术。苏联在一九五四年建立了发电力五千瓩的世界第一个原子能发电站。目前，正在建立发电力五万到十万瓩的原子能发电站。放射性同位素被普遍地用来检验冶金、化学、建筑的生产。
    现在苏联生铁、钢、煤、电力的生产都占世界第二位，而在十月革命前俄国的工业产量才占世界第五位。社会主义经济制度无可比拟地优越于资本主义经济制度。从一九二九年到一九五四年，苏联工业产量增加为十八倍，而美国才增加为二点一倍，英国才增加百分之七十二，法国才增加百分之十四，意大利才增加百分之七十七。从苏联工业发展的速度看来，苏联在不很久的将来在工业产量上按人口计算也超过最发达的资本主义国家。
    工业的迅速发展和人民生活水平的急剧提高，使苏联在第五个五年计划的第三年提出了进一步发展农业问题。苏联由集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场组成的社会主义农业取得了巨大成绩。一九五○年集体农庄的合并扩大，加强了集体农庄制度。但是按发展的速度来说，农业曾经远远赶不上工业。从一九四○年到一九五二年，按比较价格计算，苏联工业产值增加一点三倍，而农业产值只增加百分之十。最近两年来，在苏共中央加强领导之下，由于全民努力，依靠强大的重工业基础，苏联农业已经取得巨大的成果。就其使农业与工业更加适应、使苏维埃政权基础的工农联盟更加巩固、使国家握有更加充足的粮食后备、使人民获得走向共产主义所必需的更加丰富的农产品的意义来说，这个还在不断扩展的成果，是苏联农业在全盘集体化以后的最大一次胜利。
    最近两年来，苏联农业的发展，以大力提高“宝中之宝”的谷物的生产为中心，而这是靠抓紧开垦荒地、提高收获量、广种高产量谷物——玉蜀黍三个关键来解决的。
    开垦荒地，是增产谷物的最快办法。但这需要广大群众首先是青年的支持，需要大量资金和机器。苏联具备有这些条件，所以能够顺利地在东部开垦了大片荒地。在从前荒凉的西伯利亚和哈萨克斯坦的原野上，出现了四百多座新的巨型国营农场和许多机器拖拉机站。从一九五四年春天到一九五五年十月底，开垦了三千零一十多万公顷（约合四亿五千一百五十多万市亩）荒地。这些开垦出来的荒地比美国全国的小麦播种面积还要大，等于法国、法属摩洛哥、澳大利亚和阿根廷四个国家小麦播种面积的总和的两倍以上。如果每公顷收获五十到一百普特谷物，那末在这三千万公顷新地上可以收获十五亿到三十亿普特（每普特合三十二点七六市斤）谷物。
    在社会主义制度下，土地生产的潜在力量是无穷的。由于加强组织和领导，推广先进的农艺和经验，苏联今年许多地区的收成达到第五个五年计划中的最高峰。仅乌克兰、阿塞拜疆、摩尔达维亚共和国及其他十八个州、边疆区和自治共和国今年超计划多供给国家的谷物就有两亿多普特。
    玉蜀黍在苏联许多地方还是新作物。今年各地总共播种了一千七百九十万公顷，比去年增加了一千三百六十万公顷。今年乌克兰的集体农民很好地利用了地面，多种了一倍玉蜀黍，可以得到三千多万吨饲料。
    谷物的增产，保证着饲畜业的进步。例如：一九五四年十月到一九五五年六月，苏联的牛奶产量比一九五三年十月到一九五四年六月增加百分之三十，比一九五二年十月到一九五三年六月增加百分之五十五。
    正如苏联和平外交政策一样，苏联经济建设所以能够获得这样巨大的成就，是由于伟大的苏联人民的对劳动热爱，对自己祖国和共产主义建设事业的无限忠诚，是由于有以列宁主义为指针的苏联共产党的英明领导。正是依靠苏联共产党的正确领导，苏联工农业大踏步地前进着，苏联国民经济各部门充满生气勃勃的新气象。今年一月，苏联共产党中央委员会全会号召：争取在一九五六年内达到年产谷物一百亿普特。今年七月，苏共中央全会号召：在完成国民经济计划的同时，尽力提高生产的技术水平，广泛采用科学和技术的最新成就，以造成工业的新高涨。这两个有历史意义的决定指出了继续前进的方向。苏联人民正在这两个响亮的号召下，从胜利走向新的胜利！
