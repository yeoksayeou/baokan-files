　　In a construction site of the Shenyang City Construction Engineering Bureau, when implementing the unified national labor quota for the construction industry this year, they concentrated their efforts on cultivating ten model teams. All ten teams exceeded the quota by more than 20 percent. However, one month after the model teams exceeded the quota, half of the workers at the entire construction site still had not met the quota.
　　The leading staff of this construction site did not apply the experience gained from cultivating model teams to the general workers. When cultivating the model teams, they tried their best to issue task sheets in advance, rationally allocate labor organization, and ensure the timely supply of materials, etc., to help the model teams. These were good things. However, when the general workers were implementing the new quota, the leading staff did not do this. As a result, most workers finished one task but did not know what to do next, and had to wait idly for tasks. The average technical level of the teams varied greatly, and the leadership did not make adjustments. As a result, teams with high technical levels exceeded the quota and received bonuses; teams with low average technical levels could not meet the quota and did not receive basic wages. Therefore, some workers said: The leaders only see the model teams, they don't see us. This criticism is correct.
　　Cultivating model examples is precisely for the purpose of promoting the general. We must see the model examples, and especially see the general.

　　培养典型为了什么
    沈阳市建工局某工地，在贯彻执行今年全国建筑业统一劳动定额的时候，集中力量培养了十个典型小组。这十个小组，都突破了定额百分之二十以上。但是，在典型小组突破定额一个月以后，全工地还有一半工人没有达到定额。
    这个工地的领导工作人员没有把培养典型小组所得到的经验，运用到一般工人中去。在培养典型的时候，他们尽量提前发任务单，合理配备劳动组织，及时保证供应料具等，帮助典型小组。这些都是好的。但是，在一般工人都在贯彻执行新的定额的时候，领导工作人员没有这样做。这样，大部分工人干完了这一项工作，却不知道接着要干什么，只得闲着等待任务。小组的平均技术等级悬殊很大，领导上也不给调整。结果是：技术等级高的小组突破了定额，拿到了超额奖金；平均技术等级低的小组，则达不到定额，拿不到基本工资。所以，有的工人说：领导上只看见了典型小组，看不见我们。这个批评是正确的。
    培养典型正是为了推动一般。我们要看见典型，尤其要看见一般。
