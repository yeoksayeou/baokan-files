Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 22nd: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: Major General Zheng Guolu, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter on the 21st to Rear Admiral Moore, the chief member of the US side of the Military Armistice Commission, regarding the incident in which three members of the Polish delegation to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC) died in a US aircraft.

The letter stated: The incident of the death of three members of the Polish delegation to the NNSC has not only shocked the NNSC but has also shocked all people of conscience. A prompt, full, and objective investigation is absolutely necessary to help explain the truth of the incident, find the causes of the incident, identify the responsibility, and take appropriate measures.

The letter pointed out that, given that this incident directly involves the lives of NNSC personnel, it is entirely proper for the NNSC to form a group and send it to the scene of the incident to conduct an investigation. Your side should provide all assistance to the work carried out by the group dispatched by the NNSC. However, your side refused to allow the group to conduct an investigation, so the group had to return to Panmunjom headquarters without completing its task.

The letter emphasized that, at present, all peace-loving and justice-upholding people are closely watching the fact that this incident occurred in your territory, at a time when your side is openly advocating the abolition of the NNSC and when the South Korean authorities are taking violent actions against the NNSC.

Zheng Guolu finally demanded that the US side make a responsible explanation to the NNSC regarding this incident as soon as possible, and at the same time take all necessary measures to ensure the normal operation of the NNSC, the safety of its personnel, and to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

　　郑国禄要美方迅速交代波兰人员遇难事件
    新华社平壤二十二日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将就驻中立国监察委员会波兰代表团的三位人员乘美方飞机遇难的事件，在二十一日致函军事停战委员会美方首席委员穆尔海军少将。
    信中说：驻中立国监察委员会波兰代表团三位人员遇难事件，不仅使中立国监察委员会感到震惊，同时也使所有有良心的人们感到震惊。迅速地进行充分和客观的调查是完全必要的，以便帮助说明事件的真相，找出事件的原因，查明责任和采取相应的措施。
    信中指出，鉴于这个事件直接牵涉到中立国监察委员会人员的生命，所以中立国监察委员会组成小组并且派它到出事地点去进行调查，这是完全正当的。你方应当对中立国监察委员会所派遣的小组所进行的工作予以一切帮助。但是，你方拒绝让小组进行调查，因此小组只得在没有完成它的任务的情况下回到板门店总部。
    信中强调说，目前，所有爱好和平和主持正义的人都密切注意这个事实：这个事件是在你方境内发生的，是在你方公开主张取消中立国监察委员会，在南朝鲜当局对于中立国监察委员会采取暴力行动的时候发生的。
    郑国禄最后要求美方迅速就这次事件对中立国监察委员会作负责的交代，同时采取一切必要的措施，以保证中立国监察委员会的正常工作的进行、它的人员的安全以及防止类似事件的重演。
