Xinhua News Agency, November 22nd: The Chinese Red Cross Society sent a telegram on November 21st to the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan Peace Liaison Council, and the Japan-China Friendship Association Liaison Office, responding to some specific issues related to the return of nationals between China and Japan.

The telegram expressed deep regret over the recent continuous obstruction by the Japanese government of Chinese nationals in Japan who wished to return to their homeland. The telegram cited examples, stating that the Japanese government recently arrested Hong Jinshan in Nagoya, who voluntarily wanted to return to China. At the same time, Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu, four people in the Hamamatsu detention center who voluntarily wanted to return to China, are still being detained by the Japanese government and are not allowed to return to China. The telegram pointed out, "These are all violations of the wishes of the people of China and Japan for free movement of nationals between the two countries, and are unfriendly acts of discrimination against Chinese nationals in Japan." The telegram reiterated its protest against the Hong Jinshan incident and stated, "Our people are closely watching this issue, and we urge your three organization liaison offices to negotiate with the Japanese government as soon as possible so that the above-mentioned five overseas Chinese can return to China on the Xing'an Maru according to their own will."

The Chinese Red Cross Society notified the three Japanese organizations in the telegram that the number of Japanese nationals willing to return to Japan now gathered in Tianjin has increased to about 190, "which shows that we have consistently provided all conveniences and possible assistance to Japanese nationals who wish to return to Japan."

The Chinese Red Cross Society also expressed its gratitude to the Japanese Executive Committee for the Memorial Service for Chinese War Prisoners for returning 131 caskets containing the ashes of Chinese personnel who died in Japan in Hokkaido, Osaka, Shimonoseki, Moji, and other places. The Chinese Red Cross Society also welcomed the 18 representatives, including Takeaka Katsuo, who accompanied the "Xing'an Maru" to escort the ashes to China.

　　我红十字会抗议日政府一再阻难华侨回国
    新华社二十二日讯　中国红十字会二十一日打电报给日本红十字会、日本和平联络会、日中友好协会三团体联络事务局，就最近有关中日两国侨民回国的一些具体问题作了答复。
    电文中对近日连续发生的中国在日本的侨民中愿意返回祖国的人受到日本政府阻难的事情，表示非常遗憾。电文举例说，最近日本政府在名古屋逮捕了自愿返回中国的洪进山；同时，滨松收容所中自愿返回中国的潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修四人迄今仍被日本政府拘留，不得回国。电文指出，“这些都是违反中日两国人民要求双方侨民自由来往的愿望，都是歧视中国在日侨民的不友好行为。”电文表示再度对洪进山事件提出抗议，并且说：“我国人民密切注视的这一问题，务请贵三团体联络事务局速向日本政府交涉，使上述五名华侨能够根据其自愿搭乘兴安丸返回中国。”
    中国红十字会在电报中通知日本三团体说，现在天津集结的愿意回国的日本侨民，已经增加到一百九十名左右，“可见我们对愿意返回日本的日侨，是一贯地给予一切便利和可能的协助的”。
    中国红十字会还表示感谢日本的中国俘虏殉难者追悼执行委员会把在北海道、大阪、下关、门司等地的中国在日本殉难人员的骨灰一百三十一具送还中国。中国红十字会同时表示欢迎由竹中胜男等十八位代表随同“兴安丸”护送上述骨灰前来中国。
