　　Investigation of Illiteracy Elimination Work in a Village
　　Nan Feng
    Sha Tuo Village in Fuxian County, Liaoning Province, after six years of effort, had basically eliminated illiteracy among village cadres and young people by the time of the August 1955 survey.

    Over the past six years, a total of 96 illiterate people have been made literate in the village, and 101 illiterate people have been raised to the level of semi-literate. During this year's busy farming season and the intense drought resistance campaign, the village's four private schools have continued to hold classes, with a total of 218 students, including 86 in literacy classes, 30 in higher primary classes, and 102 in self-study classes for higher primary graduates.

    The illiteracy elimination work in Sha Tuo Village has gone through several stages. From 1949 to 1951, progress was not significant. At that time, winter schools mainly "served politics" and did not seriously focus on learning culture. In 1952, the village promoted the rapid literacy method, creating a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture and achieving some results; however, it truly "got on track" after the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives in the village and the adoption of the "school-run by the cooperative" approach. Over the past few years, Sha Tuo Village has accumulated a lot of experience in illiteracy elimination work. The main experiences are:

    I. Using various effective forms of learning. (1) Primarily organizing the masses to participate in farmer's spare-time cultural schools (including winter schools and year-round private schools). According to the experience of this village, if school can start on time and persist in learning for 250 hours each winter, and if year-round learning can be maintained after the winter learning is over, then "two winters plus one summer" can eliminate an illiterate person. (2) Adopting the method of taking village cadres with busier positions, such as party branch secretaries and agricultural production cooperative directors, away from production for study. Last year, two village cadres participated in the county's "cadre off-the-job literacy classes." They originally only knew two to three hundred characters, but after two months of study, they reached the standard for illiteracy elimination. After returning to the village, they became active backbones in leading the village's illiteracy elimination work. (3) Adopting the method of contracting teaching and learning for other village cadres. (4) In the winter of 1954, four self-study groups were organized to help people who could not attend school to study on their own. (5) The village Communist Youth League branch established a library with 3,000 books, of which the Youth League branch mobilized young people to collect more than 500 books, urban youth donated 1,000 books, and the agricultural production cooperative bought 1,500 books. The newspapers and periodicals subscribed to by the agricultural production cooperative and individuals in the village include: two copies of the People's Daily, five copies of the Liaoning Daily, four copies of the China Youth Daily, nineteen copies of the Liaoning Farmer's Daily, twenty-two copies of the Liaoning Youth Daily, and one copy each of "Youth League Member" and "PLA Literature and Art." These books and newspapers have played a significant role in preventing "relapse" and consolidating and improving the cultural and political level of the masses.

    II. Appropriately resolving the contradictions between learning and production, and learning and meetings. The masses all reflected that the main reason why learning was not good in the past, or even collapsed, was that the above two contradictions were not resolved or not resolved well. In the past, after the agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid groups finished their work, they had to score work points every night, and each scoring session was like "passing the court," lasting until midnight. Now, the method of "quota contracting and scoring on the spot" is adopted, and higher primary school graduates are used to record work points, so there is no need to score at night anymore. The Party branch and the agricultural production cooperative stipulated that all meetings should not hinder evening learning. Production meetings should be held during the noon break, and they should be short and few. The meetings of the Party and Youth League organizations are held on Saturday evenings after the political class. The meetings of cooperative members and branch meetings are held on Sunday evenings. This ensures that the five evenings from Monday to Friday for learning culture are not encroached upon. The Party branch also believes that propaganda work should be done anytime and anywhere, and there is no need to hold a large meeting for everything. At the same time, with private schools, the work of the cooperative and the village can be conveyed through the private school, without the need for special meetings. They said that meetings used to take a lot of time, but in reality, "it's not that the meetings are long, but the waiting is long."

    III. Pay attention to selecting private school teachers and improving teaching quality. The quality of private school teachers is very important to whether private schools can persist. Nan Suqin, the village Communist Youth League secretary who has already escaped illiteracy, recalled her cultural learning and said: "Our village private school teacher Yan Bailu is serious in his teaching and lectures vividly. In 1952, eighty-two people attended winter school, and none of them left until the end, there were still eighty-two people. However, Lin Yongchang was not good as a private school teacher. When he signed up for school, there were forty to fifty people, because he was impatient, and when people didn't understand, he would glare at them, and later only four or five people were left." Therefore, village cadres all understand that they must carefully select appropriate people to serve as private school teachers. The people who are now serving as private school teachers are loved by the masses. Youth League member Nan Guizhi is a model private school teacher in the county. Youth League member Zhao Mingju personally picks up and drops off students every day, without complaining, and works patiently, "even if others don't understand three times, he patiently teaches until they understand." The village's nineteen private school teachers spend one day a week on teaching research and collective lesson preparation, and formulate a week's progress and work plan. Therefore, the teaching level of each private school teacher has been improved, and the learning enthusiasm of the students has also increased. The agricultural production cooperative gives work points to private school teachers for lesson preparation and attending meetings in the county and district, and also subsidizes them with 30 to 50 work points each year, so private school teachers are even more passionate about their work. (Note: Generally, private school teachers should be voluntary. In the private schools run by agricultural production cooperatives with a better foundation, if private school teachers delay production due to teaching work, appropriate work points can be given with the consent of the members, but it is not appropriate to emphasize doing so too early in newly established cooperatives.)

    IV. Leaders pay attention and cadres take the lead. The village has basically been cooperativized, and village cadres and cooperative cadres feel the importance of learning culture more than ever. Fu Derun, director of the agricultural production cooperative, said: "There are eighteen production team leaders in the cooperative. To be a team leader, you have to lead people, and you can't be as careless as doing your own work. If you can't keep accounts and can't understand plans, there's no way to lead production." Bai Yunhe was not very willing to learn at first, but later became a production team leader. Because he was illiterate, he could only memorize the scoring every day, which was both tiring and incomplete. He felt very painful not knowing how to read, and later he decided to learn. Now he can recognize more than 1,500 characters and can score on the spot. He said: "If you know how to read, you can record as you go, without having to score every day, which doesn't delay rest and doesn't make mistakes." This shows that village cadres all feel the benefits of learning culture. Furthermore, some of the masses look at the example of the cadres. Some say: "If the cadres don't study, what's the point of us learning?" Others say: "Look, people who are illiterate can still be cadres." Therefore, as long as the cadres go to school, the ideological obstacles to the masses learning culture are easily eliminated. Everyone says that when cadres take the lead, learning will be good. Now all village cadres, except those with a higher primary school education or above, are studying in year-round private schools. Because the cadres themselves participate in learning, the difficulties of the masses in learning are also the difficulties of the cadres themselves. Therefore, the cadres promptly understand and solve concrete problems such as the houses, kerosene, desks and chairs of the private schools.

    V. The Communist Youth League branch plays an active role. Of the nineteen private school teachers in the village, eighteen are young people, eight of whom are Youth League members, and the principal of the private school is also a Youth League member. And these eighteen young people are all higher primary school graduates. Of the thirty-eight Youth League members in the village, except for eight who serve as private school teachers and two female Youth League members who did not participate in learning due to having children, all participated in private school learning. They have played an active role in mobilizing others to learn, persisting in learning, and carrying out cultural and recreational activities.

    The main problem with the illiteracy elimination work in this village is that there is no complete plan. The village cadres don't know how many illiterate people have already been eliminated, how many illiterate people there are still, how many illiterate people will be eliminated each year, and when illiteracy will be completely eliminated. They also underestimate the difficulties in future work. Of the 1,317 people in the village, 449 are between the ages of 14 and 45, of which 166 are still illiterate and 59 are semi-literate, totaling more than 50% of the 449 people. Although 86 of the 225 illiterate and semi-literate people are already studying in year-round private schools, the remaining 139 people are mostly older, have more children, are not highly motivated, and are completely illiterate, which shows that illiteracy elimination work becomes more difficult later on.

    The farmers in Sha Tuo Village live relatively concentratedly, are relatively wealthy, have a relatively high level of culture, have many sources of private school teachers, and have sufficient strength to eliminate illiteracy. There are 102 higher primary school graduates in the village alone (only 14 before liberation), and seven junior high school graduates. Moreover, there is also a foundation for illiteracy elimination work, and the masses are relatively highly motivated. In particular, the village has basically been cooperativized, and problems such as learning time, private school teachers, and funding are relatively easy to solve. These are all favorable conditions for carrying out illiteracy elimination work in the future. Recently, the cadres, library administrators, etc. of the Party, Youth League, administration, and agricultural production cooperative of Sha Tuo Village had a discussion and made a comprehensive plan to basically eliminate illiteracy in the entire village (ages 14 to 45) during the first five-year plan period. It is required to mobilize all 139 illiterate and semi-literate people who have not yet enrolled in school to enroll in school. And continue to improve the cultural level of the 218 non-illiterate people. The specific methods are: 1. Add three literacy classes and expand one literacy class in the village's four villages. This winter, mobilize 80 illiterate people to participate in learning, and mobilize another group next summer. Require people without special difficulties to participate in learning. And the village's cultural and educational director and principal should prepare the budget for the private school's expenses before the start of school and report it to the members' meeting for approval. In addition, find good houses for the newly added literacy classes to use; 2. Carry out a contracted teaching and learning campaign, mobilizing higher primary school graduates and young people who have already escaped illiteracy to provide individual education to village cadres with special difficulties (many things, many meetings) and women with many children. Put forward the slogan "Every rural educated youth must eliminate one illiterate person," and the Youth League branch is responsible for regular inspection; 3. Send two more village cadres to participate in the county's "cadre off-the-job literacy classes" for study; 4. Run the village library well, regularly carry out newspaper reading work, consolidate and improve the cultural and political level of non-illiterate people, and prevent relapse; 5. Take more and more effective measures to improve teaching quality.

　　一个村的扫除文盲工作调查
　　南峰
    辽宁省复县沙坨村，经过六年的努力，到一九五五年八月调查时为止，全村干部和青年文盲已经基本扫除。
    六年来，全村共扫除了文盲九十六名，有一百零一名文盲提高为半文盲。在今年农忙季节和紧张的抗旱运动中，本村的四个民校一直坚持学习，共有学员二百一十八人，其中扫盲班八十六人、高小班三十人、高小毕业生自学班一百零二人。
    沙坨村的扫除文盲工作经历了几个阶段。从一九四九年到一九五一年的三年中，成绩是不大的。那时冬学主要是“为政治服务”，没有认真学习文化。一九五二年村里推行了速成识字法，造成学习文化的热潮，收到一定效果；而真正“上道”，是在本村成立了农业生产合作社，采用了“以社办学”的办法以后。几年来，沙坨村在扫除文盲工作中积累了不少经验，主要经验是：
    一、运用各种有效的学习形式。（1）主要是组织广大群众参加农民业余文化学校（包括冬学和常年民校）学习。根据这个村子的经验，如果能按时开学，一冬坚持学习二百五十个小时，冬季学习结束后又能坚持常年学习，那末“两冬加一夏”，就可扫除一个文盲。（2）对一部分职务较忙的村干部，如党支部书记、农业生产合作社主任采取脱离生产学习的办法。去年有两个村干部到县参加
  “干部脱产扫盲学习班”学习。他们原来都只识得二三百字，学习两个月后达到扫除文盲标准。回村后，成了积极领导全村扫除文盲工作的骨干。（3）对其他的村干部采用包教包学的办法。（4）一九五四年冬季组织了四个自学小组，帮助不能入学的人自学。（5）村团支部设立了一个图书室，共有三千本书，其中团支部发动青年收集了五百多本图书，城市青年赠送了一千本，农业生产合作社又买了一千五百本。全村由农业生产合作社和个人订阅的报刊有：人民日报二份，辽宁日报五份，中国青年报四份，辽宁农民报十九份，辽宁青年报二十二份，“青年团员”和“解放军文艺”各一份。这些书报对防止“回生”，巩固和提高群众的文化水平和政治水平起了很大作用。
    二、恰当地解决了学习和生产、学习和开会的矛盾。群众都反映：过去学习不好，甚至垮台，主要原因是上面这两个矛盾没有解决和解决得不好。过去在农业生产合作社、互助组干完活，每天晚上得评分，每次评分好像“过大堂”，一评就是半夜。现在采用了“定额包工，地头评分”的办法，并且运用高小毕业生记工，已经不用在晚上评分了。党支部和农业生产合作社规定：一切会议不能妨碍晚间学习。生产会议利用晌午休息时间开，要开得少、开得短。党、团组织的会议放在星期六晚上政治课以后。社员大会、支部大会放在星期天晚上开。这样就保证了星期一到星期五五个晚间学习文化的时间不被侵占。党支部还认为，宣传工作要随时随地做，不要什么事都开大会。同时，有了民校，社和村的工作就可通过民校传达，不用专门开会了。他们说，过去开会费时间，实际上“不是开的久，而是等得长”。
    三、注意选拔民校教师，提高教学质量。民校教师的好坏，对民校能否坚持，关系很大。已经脱离文盲状态的村团支部书记南素琴回忆她学习文化的情形说：“咱村民校教师阎百路因为教学认真，讲得生动，一九五二年八十二个人上冬学，到结束时一个没少，还是八十二个人。但是，林永昌担任民校教师就不行了，报名入学的时候有四五十人，因为他不耐烦，人家一个不懂，他就瞪眼，后来只剩下四五个人了。”所以村干部都懂得要细心选择适当的人担任民校教师。现在担任民校教师的人，都获得群众的爱戴。团员南桂芝是全县的模范民校教师。团员赵明举每天亲自接送学员，不发牢骚，工作耐心，“别人就是三次不懂，也耐着性子教到懂为止”。全村十九个民校教师每星期用一天时间进行教学研究和集体备课，并订出一周的进度和工作计划。因此每个民校教师的教学水平都有提高，学员学习情绪也跟着高涨。农业生产合作社对于民校教师备课和上县、区开会，照给工分，另外每年补贴三十到五十个工分，所以民校教师也就更加热爱自己的工作。（注：一般民校教师都应是义务性质。在基础较好的农业生产合作社所办的民校中，如果民校教师因教学工作耽误了生产，可在社员同意的原则下，补给适当的工分，但在新办社内不宜过早强调这样做。）
    四、领导重视，干部带头。这个村已基本合作化，村干部和社干部格外感到学习文化的重要。农业生产合作社主任傅德润说：“全社有十八个生产队长。当队长的要领导人，不能像自家干活那么马虎，如果不会记账，看不懂计划，实在没法领导生产。”白云鹤本来不大愿意学习，后来担任了生产队长，因为不识字，每天评分，只能死记，既累得慌，又记不全，感到不识字很痛苦，后来才决心学习，现在已能识一千五百多字，可以在地头记分了。他说：“识了字，可以随做随记，不用天天评分，既不耽误休息，又不得差错。”这说明村干部都感觉到学文化的好处。再就是有些群众看干部的样。有的说：“人家当干部的都不学习，我们学它干什么？”有的说：“你看，人家没文化还不是一样当干部。”因此，只要干部上学，群众学习文化的思想障碍就容易扫除。大家都说，干部带头，学习就好。现在全村干部除高小以上文化水平的以外，都在常年民校学习。由于干部自己参加了学习，群众学习上的困难，也就是干部自己的困难，所以民校的房子、灯油、桌椅等具体问题，干部都及时了解，及时给解决了。
    五、团支部起了积极作用。全村十九个民校教师，十八个是青年，其中八个是团员，民校校长也是团员。而这十八个青年，又全是高小毕业生。村里的三十八名团员除八名担任民校教师，两名女团员因生小孩没参加学习外，全部参加了民校学习。他们在动员别人学习、坚持学习以及在开展文化娱乐活动上都起了积极作用。
    这个村子的扫除文盲工作存在的主要问题，是没有一个完整的计划。已经扫除了多少文盲，还有多少文盲，每年扫除多少文盲，什么时候完全扫除文盲，村干部心里没有底，对今后工作上的困难也估计不足。全村一千三百一十七人中，十四岁到四十五岁的人有四百四十九人，其中还有文盲一百六十六人，半文盲五十九人，两项合计占四百四十九人中的百分之五十强。虽然二百二十五个文盲和半文盲中已有八十六人在常年民校学习，但余下的一百三十九人大都是年纪大、子女多、觉悟不够高和全文盲的人，这说明扫除文盲工作愈到后来愈加艰苦。
    沙坨村农民居住比较集中，生活比较富裕，文化水平比较高，民校教师来源多，扫除文盲力量足，单高小毕业生全村就有一百零二人（解放前只十四人），初中毕业生七人，而且扫除文盲工作也有基础，群众觉悟比较高。特别是全村已经基本合作化，学习时间、民校教师和经费等问题都比较好解决。这些都是今后开展扫除文盲工作的有利条件。最近沙坨村党、团、行政、农业生产合作社的干部、图书室管理员等作了讨论，作出了在第一个五年计划期间基本上扫除全村的文盲（十四至四十五岁）的全面计划。要求动员未入学的一百三十九个文盲和半文盲全部入学。并且继续提高二百一十八个非文盲的文化水平。具体办法是：一、全村四个屯增设三个扫盲班，扩大一个扫盲班。今冬动员八十名文盲参加学习，明年夏季再动员一批，要求没有特殊困难的人都参加学习。并且由村文教主任、校长在开学前做好民校的经费预算，报社员大会批准。另外要找好房子，给新增加的扫盲班用；二、开展包教包学运动，动员高小毕业生及已经脱离文盲状态的青年对有特殊困难的村干部（事多、会多）和多子女的妇女进行个别教育。提出“每个农村知识青年一定要扫除一个文盲”的口号，并且由团支部负责定期检查；三、再派两名村干部参加县的“干部脱产扫盲学习班”学习；四、办好村图书室，经常开展读报工作，巩固和提高非文盲的文化水平和政治水平，防止发生回生现象；五、采取更多、更有效的办法提高教学质量。
