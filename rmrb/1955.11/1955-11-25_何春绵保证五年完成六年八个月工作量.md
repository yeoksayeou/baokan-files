　　He Chunmian Guarantees Completion of Six Years and Eight Months' Worth of Work in Five Years
　　Xiang Zhong
　　He Chunmian, a youth milling machine operator at the Fushun Machine Repair Factory, a Fushun City labor model, and a Communist Party member, has set an advanced plan to complete the equivalent of six years and eight months of work within the first Five-Year Plan. He has already completed this year's state plan ahead of schedule.
    He Chunmian's main method of completing the state plan ahead of schedule is to continuously learn advanced experience. Last year, he studied advanced experience such as high-speed cutting, multiple workpiece clamping, and template operation. Later, he improved his tools several times, increasing production efficiency by one time and completing one year and six and a half months' worth of work in one year. At the beginning of this year, He Chunmian and Bai Shaoyong, who worked on the same machine tool, jointly studied and set a plan to complete one year and four months' worth of work in one year. By August, they had already completed ten months' worth of work. After the announcement of the first Five-Year Plan, he and Bai Shaoyong studied again and improved the vise, increasing efficiency by more than two times.
    On September 17th, after He Chunmian returned from attending the Liaoning Provincial Youth Socialist Construction Activist Conference, he encountered the task of processing "connecting" workpieces. The workers initially used a planer for processing, but due to the high hardness of the processed material, they couldn't handle it. Then they tried using a lathe, but the lathe also couldn't handle it. Finally, it was brought to the milling machine for processing. The first two shifts of milling machine workers were afraid that the milling machine would break down if it rotated too fast, so they didn't dare to increase the speed. He Chunmian saw that the efficiency was too low, so he studied the efficiency of the workpiece and the machine tool and decided to try sharpening the cutter a bit. The test result was very good. From then on, he sharpened the cutter during every break, and during work, he would replace a dull cutter with another one. Then he tested and promoted high-speed cutting, and the efficiency increased by more than one time.
    Now, He Chunmian has put forward an even more advanced plan.

　　何春绵保证五年完成六年八个月工作量
　　向众
    抚顺机修厂青年铣工、抚顺市劳动模范、共产党员何春绵，订出了在第一个五年计划内完成相当于六年零八个月的工作量的先进计划。现在，他已经提前完成了今年国家计划。
    何春绵提前完成国家计划的主要方法，是不断地学习先进经验。去年，他学习了高速切削、多卡活件和胎型作业等先进经验，后来又数次改进工具，使生产效率提高了一倍，一年内完成了一年零六个半月的工作量。今年开始，何春绵和同机床的白绍永共同研究，订出了一年完成一年零四个月工作量的计划。到八月，他们已经完成了十个月的工作量。第一个五年计划公布后，他又同白绍永研究，改进了虎钳子，效率提高了两倍多。
    九月十七日，何春绵出席辽宁省青年社会主义建设积极分子大会回来后，正赶上加工“接手”活件。工人们开始用刨床加工，因为加工物的硬度太强，干不了，就让车床加工，车床还是干不了，最后拿到铣床加工。铣床的头两班工人怕铣床转快了受不了，不敢加快转数。何春绵一看效率太低，便研究了活件和床子的效能，决定把刀磨快一点试试。试验效果很好。从这以后，他一到休息时间就磨刀，在工作中，这把用钝了就换另一把。接着他又试验推行了高速切削，于是效率又提高了一倍多。
    现在，何春绵又提出了一个更先进的计划。
