Lanzhou, November 2nd (Reported by this newspaper) – The 539-kilometer section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway from Lanzhou to Zhangye has officially opened to traffic on November 1st. At 3:30 PM on the 1st, a passenger train adorned with colorful silk, amidst the deafening sound of gongs and drums, departed from Zhangye for Lanzhou. Simultaneously, a train from Lanzhou to Zhangye, having traversed dozens of miles of sparsely populated grasslands, saline flats, and Gobi deserts swept by sandstorms, arrived punctually at Zhangye Station. Tens of thousands of workers, farmers, and local residents gathered at Zhangye Station on this day to celebrate the opening of this section of the railway. Some people traveled from dozens of miles away on camels or in iron-wheeled carts to see the train. The train has brought to the farmers large quantities of agricultural production materials and daily necessities, as well as construction equipment needed to support Xinjiang and the Hexi Corridor region of Gansu. Meanwhile, grain, cotton, livestock, medicinal materials, and local specialties produced in Xinjiang Province and the Zhangye area, known as "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall," are also being prepared to be concentrated in Zhangye for loading onto trains and transport outwards. With the railway extending to Zhangye, the petroleum produced by the Yumen Oilfield will be transported eastward by train from here. This will not only reduce the automobile transportation distance by more than 200 kilometers compared to transporting it from Wuwei by train but also save a lot of transportation costs.

    兰新铁路兰州到张掖段开始通车营业
    本报兰州二日电　兰新铁路兰州到张掖的五百三十九公里线路已经在十一月一日开始通车营业。一日下午三时半，悬挂着彩绸的旅客列车，在喧天的锣鼓声中，由张掖开往兰州。同时由兰州开往张掖的一列火车，也经过了几十里路渺无人烟的草滩、域滩和风沙弥漫的戈壁滩，准时到达了张掖车站。这一天有数万工人、农民和当地居民在张掖车站庆祝这段线路的通车。有的人是从几十里外骑着骆驼或乘坐铁轮大车赶来看火车的。火车给农民们运来了大批农业生产资料和生活日用品，还有各地支援新疆、甘肃河西走廊地区所需要的建设器材。同时新疆省和被称为“塞外江南”的张掖一带出产的粮食、棉花、牲畜、药材和土特产，也准备集中在张掖装火车外运。铁路通车到张掖以后，玉门油矿出产的石油将从这里用火车东运，这样不仅比从武威用火车外运减少了二百多公里的汽车运输路程，还可以节省很多运费。
