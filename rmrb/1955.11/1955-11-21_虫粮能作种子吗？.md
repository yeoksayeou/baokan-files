To the Editor:
    We want to expose an infuriating matter: The Wuhan Municipal Grain Bureau actually transferred a large batch of broad beans that had been infested with insects to our county's farmers as seeds!
    On October 28th, 200,000 jin of broad bean seeds were transferred from Wuhan to our county. Among them, more than 21,600 jin were severely infested with insects, and more than 33,000 jin were unsproutable, bad and mixed-variety beans. We want to question the Wuhan Municipal Grain Bureau: What reason do you have for transferring these broad beans to our county? If these broad beans already had insects when they were put into storage, then why didn't you refuse to accept them at the time? If the broad beans became infested with insects after they were put into storage, why didn't you immediately take preventative measures? If you only discovered the insects in the broad beans when they were being transferred, you should not have transferred them at all! How much would it cost to transport this batch of broad beans, intended for use as seeds, from Wuhan to Hengyang? After it is transported to our county, how can we sell it to the farmers as seeds?
    We request the Wuhan Municipal People's Committee Supervisory Bureau to investigate and deal with this matter.

　  虫粮能作种子吗？编辑同志：
    我们要揭发一件令人气愤的事：武汉市粮食管理局竟把大批已经遭到虫蚀的蚕豆调给我县农民当种子！
    十月二十八日，武汉市调来我县蚕豆种二十万斤，其中已经遭到严重虫蚀的有二万一千六百多斤，不能发芽的废豆和杂种豆有三万三千多斤。我们要责问武汉市粮食管理局：你们有什么理由把这些蚕豆调给我县呢？如果这些蚕豆在入库的时候就有虫，那末，你们当时为什么不拒绝接收呢？如果蚕豆是入库以后才生虫的，你们为什么不立即进行防治呢？如果蚕豆在调运的时候才发现有虫，更是不应该这样外调！这批充作种子的蚕豆，从武汉运到衡阳，要花掉多少运费？运到我县以后，又叫我们怎样能够把它当种子卖给农民？
    我们要求武汉市人民委员会监察局对这件事情进行检查和处理。
