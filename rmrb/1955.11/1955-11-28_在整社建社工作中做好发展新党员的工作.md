In the mass movement of agricultural cooperation, the work of developing new Party members should be carried out regularly. In conjunction with the work of building and rectifying communes, attention should be paid to educating advanced elements from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds who actively participate in the movement and believe in communism, and absorbing those who meet the qualifications of Party members into the Party. In this way, with the development of cooperation, Party branches, Party groups, or Party group teams can be established in every agricultural production cooperative within a certain period. This is of utmost importance for Party building and strengthening the Party's leadership over the agricultural cooperation movement.

Developing new Party members in rural areas must be closely linked to the agricultural cooperation movement. Party committees at all levels should unify the work of building and rectifying communes with the work of developing new Party members, making unified plans and arrangements, and guiding Party township branches to carry out plans for building and rectifying communes and developing new Party members in the entire township in stages and batches. Some Party committees have already guided Party township branches to carry out such plans. Sanxing Township in Wenjiang County, Sichuan Province, has a population of more than 8,000 and currently has 30 Party members. Under the leadership of the Party township branch, it has established six agricultural production cooperatives. According to the current work foundation, their plan is: to establish 22 cooperatives this winter and develop 19 new Party members in conjunction with building and rectifying communes; after a period of preparation, to establish two more cooperatives next autumn, while developing 31 new Party members. In this way, together with the previous members, there will be a total of 80 Party members, accounting for 1% of the township's population. By 1957, through the expansion of old cooperatives, the entire township will be collectivized, and a Party general branch can be established in the township, with branch offices established in nine villages, and Party groups or Party group teams in each agricultural production cooperative. Of course, this plan is not detailed enough, and it must be revised at any time in actual work. However, with such a plan for the Party township branch, the plans of Party committees at all levels will have a practical and reliable foundation, and the Party township branch can carry out its work in a planned and prepared manner.

How to combine building and rectifying communes with the work of developing new Party members? Party branches must constantly pay attention to discovering and cultivating activists in the work of building and rectifying communes. With a large number of activists united around the branch, the work of building and rectifying communes will have a mass foundation, which will create conditions for the work of developing new Party members. Selecting the backbone of building and rectifying communes must pay attention to their socialist enthusiasm, their connection with the masses, their class background, and their ability to run the cooperative. Among the backbone of building and rectifying communes, candidates for Party membership can be selected and developed according to the conditions of Party members. However, to raise an activist in building and rectifying communes to the level of a Communist Party member, much work still needs to be done. Party branches must consciously assign specific tasks to those who apply to join the Party, and further test their class consciousness and political qualities in actual struggles, especially when resolving contradictions between individual and collective interests, when overcoming difficulties in practical work, and when fighting against the enemy. Before admitting new Party members, they must also be educated in communism and the Communist Party, and in how to be a Communist Party member. When county Party committees train the backbone of building and rectifying communes, they can also include Party knowledge as part of the educational content. After such education, new Party members may have a preliminary understanding of Party knowledge before joining the Party, and the backbone of building and rectifying communes can also understand the role of Party leadership, which will help to strengthen the Party's ties with the masses.

In developing new Party members in rural areas, the political history and social relations of each applicant must also be strictly examined. In the current complex and acute class struggle in rural areas, counter-revolutionaries, class dissidents, and various bad elements are always trying in every possible way to infiltrate our Party and carry out activities to undermine the Party and the people's cause. An important method for them to infiltrate the Party is to conceal their political history and pretend to be active and deceive the Party's trust. Any negligence in our work of admitting new Party members may lead us to regard the enemy as socialist activists. The example of Qiu Huaiyou, a bad element in Luozhang Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, infiltrating the Party and carrying out counter-revolutionary activities is a serious lesson. Qiu Huaiyou was a loafer who had never worked. His father and his counter-revolutionary uncle-in-law had committed serious illegal acts and were punished by the People's Government. He harbored resentment about this matter. In 1946, he infiltrated the militia organization and pretended to be active for a long time. In 1953, when the cooperative was established, he actively signed up to join the cooperative and assisted Zhao Shucheng, the chief of the county public security bureau, in investigating a case, gaining Zhao Shucheng's trust. In April 1954, he participated in the district Party committee's training class for activists. Seeing that the opportunity had come, he actively asked to join the Party. With Zhao Shucheng's support, the village branch also believed that "Qiu Huaiyou took the initiative to join the cooperative, worked actively, arrived early for meetings, and was able to write and speak well. The branch did not mobilize him to apply for Party membership," so without strictly examining his history and social relations, it approved his admission to the Party. On October 10, the district Party committee approved his admission as a Party member. On the 11th, he distributed reactionary leaflets in the village. On the 15th, an admission ceremony was held, and that night he distributed reactionary leaflets again. It was not until the county public security bureau came to the village to investigate the case that Zhao Shucheng still organized a case-solving team headed by Qiu Huaiyou. Finally, relying on the masses, this bad element was exposed and arrested. This lesson tells us that admitting a new Party member is not enough to merely look at his temporary
  "active performance" in building and rectifying communes, because enemies who try to infiltrate the Party will disguise themselves in this way. Raising political vigilance and strictly examining the political history and social relations of applicants for Party membership is an important method for identifying all class enemies who try to infiltrate the Party.

In order to strengthen the Party's leadership over the cooperation movement, it is necessary to admit a number of new Party members in rural areas. At the same time, the cooperation movement will inevitably produce a large number of activists, and it is entirely possible to develop a number of new Party members from among them. However, some comrades currently emphasize unilaterally developing the number of Party members to "meet" the needs of the cooperation movement, thus neglecting the quality of new Party members. Other comrades believe that as long as the cooperation movement is launched, it will create conditions for developing new Party members, and that a concentrated effort at a certain time will complete the task of developing new Party members, thus relaxing the regular practical work of developing Party members. All of these ideas are wrong. In the agricultural cooperation movement, we must develop a certain number of Party members, but it is more important to ensure the quality of new Party members. Therefore, we must carefully select candidates for new Party members, strictly follow the procedures for joining the Party, and strengthen the education and examination of probationary Party members. Only in this way can we ensure that all newly developed Party members meet the conditions for Party membership and prevent anyone who does not meet the conditions for Party membership from joining the Party.

Developing new Party members and strengthening the Party organization is an obligation that every Party member should fulfill. However, to do this work well, it must have the close leadership of Party committees at all levels, and it must have the Party branches conducting work regularly. Every county and district Party committee should select a group of completely reliable Party member cadres with experience in Party building and a pure ideological style from the rural work teams or among the district Party committee staff to serve as Party organizers and entrust them to help and guide Party branches in doing this work. Moreover, relying on them to conduct detailed talks with new Party members is of great importance for guiding the work of developing Party members. At present, Party member cadres in some local rural work teams have not paid attention to doing Party development work, and some Party branches still lack knowledge and experience in developing new Party members. This requires Party leading organs to constantly help them summarize experience, gradually learn this work from practical work, and carry out the work of developing new Party members actively, with leadership, and in a planned manner.

### 在整社建社工作中做好发展新党员的工作

　　在整社建社工作中做好发展新党员的工作
    在农业合作化的群众运动中，应当经常进行发展新党员的工作。结合建社和整社工作，对于那些积极参加运动的、相信共产主义的贫农和下中农成份的先进分子，应该注意对他们进行共产主义和共产党的教育，吸收他们中合乎党员条件的人到党内来。这样，就可以随着合作化的发展，在一定时期内，使每一个农业生产合作社内都能建立起党的支部、党的小组或党团小组，这对党的建设和加强党对农业合作化运动的领导，都是具有极其重要的意义的。
    在农村中发展新党员必须同农业合作化运动紧密结合起来。各级党委应该将建社、整社工作同发展新党员的工作，统一规划，统一部署，并且要指导党的乡支部进行全乡分期分批建社、整社和发展新党员的规划。目前有些党委已经指导党的乡支部来进行这样的规划。四川省温江县三圣乡是一个有八千多人口的乡，现在有三十名党员，在党的乡支部领导下，已经建立了六个农业生产合作社。他们根据现在工作基础作出的规划是：在今冬要建立二十二个社，并且结合建社、整社发展新党员十九人；经过一个时间的准备工作后，到明秋再建两个社，同时发展新党员三十一人，这样连前将共有党员八十人，占全乡人口的百分之一；到一九五七年，经过老社的扩大，即可全乡合作化，全乡可建立党的总支部，在九个村成立分支部，每个农业生产合作社内都有党的小组或党团小组。当然，这种规划还不够细致，在实际工作中也还必须随时修正。但是，党的乡支部有了这样的规划，各级党委的规划就有了实际可靠的基础，党的乡支部就可以有计划有准备地去进行工作。
    怎样结合建社、整社进行发展新党员的工作呢？党的支部必须在建社、整社等工作中，经常地注意发现和培养积极分子，有了大批的积极分子团结在支部的周围，建社、整社工作就有了群众基础，也就为发展新党员的工作创造了条件。选择建社、整社的骨干，必须注意他们的社会主义积极性、同群众的联系、阶级成份以及办社能力等；在建社、整社的骨干中，就可以按照党员条件选拔发展党员的对象。但是要将一个建社、整社中的积极分子，提高到共产党员的水平，还需要进行许多工作。党的支部必须有意识地分配要求入党者的具体工作，从实际斗争中进一步考验他们的阶级觉悟和政治品质，特别是在解决个人利益和集体利益矛盾的时候，在克服实际工作的困难的时候，和在同敌人进行斗争的时候去考验他们。在接收新党员入党之前，还必须对他们进行共产主义和共产党的教育，进行怎样做一个共产党员的教育，县委在训练建社、整社的骨干时，也可以将党的知识作为教育内容之一。经过这样的教育，新党员在入党之前就可能初步懂得党的知识，建社、整社的骨干也可以懂得党的领导的作用，有助于密切党同群众的联系。
    在农村中发展新党员，还必须对每一个申请入党者的政治历史、社会关系进行严格的审查。在目前农村复杂尖锐的阶级斗争中，反革命分子、阶级异己分子以及各种坏分子，总是千方百计地企图混入我们党内，进行破坏党和人民事业的活动的，而他们混入党内的重要方法就是隐瞒政治历史，并且伪装积极、骗取党的信任。我们在接收新党员工作中有任何疏忽，就有可能将敌人当成社会主义的积极分子。山西省壶关县罗掌村坏分子仇怀有混入党内进行反革命活动的事例就是一个严重的教训。仇怀有是一个一贯不劳动的流氓，他的父亲和反革命的姑父都有严重的违法行为，被人民政府法办了，他对这事怀恨在心。一九四六年他混入民兵组织，长期伪装积极，一九五三年办社时，他又积极报名入社，并协助县公安局赵书成股长调查了一个案件，取得了赵书成的信任。一九五四年四月他参加了区委的积极分子训练班，看到时机已到，就积极要求入党，在赵书成的支持下，该村支部也认为“仇怀有主动入社、工作积极、开会早到、能写会说，支部没有动员他就要求入党”，因而未经严格审查他的历史和社会关系，就通过接收他入党。十月十日区委批准接收他为党员，十一日他就在村内散发反动传单。十五日举行了入党仪式，当天黑夜他又再次散发反动传单。直到县公安局到村破案时，赵书成还以仇怀有为首组织了破案小组。最后才依靠群众揭露逮捕了这个坏分子。这个教训告诉我们，接收一个新党员，仅仅看他在建社、整社中一时一事的
  “积极表现”还是不够的，因为企图混入党内的敌人都会这样伪装起来的；提高政治警惕性，严格审查入党者的政治历史和社会关系，就是识别一切企图混入党内的阶级敌人的重要方法。
    为了加强党对合作化运动的领导，在农村中接收一批新党员，是十分必要的，同时，合作化运动中也必然会不断地涌现出大批的积极分子，从他们中间发展一批新党员也是完全可能的。但是，目前有一些同志，片面地强调从发展党员数量上去“满足”合作化运动的需要，因而忽视了新党员的质量；也有一些同志认为，只要合作化运动搞起来了，就给发展新党员创造了条件，到一定时候突击一下，就可以完成发展新党员的任务，因而放松了发展党员经常的实际的工作。所有这些思想，都是不对的。在农业合作化运动中，我们必须发展一定数量的党员，但是更重要的是要保证新党员的质量。因此，我们必须认真地挑选新党员对象，严格地履行入党手续，加强对候补党员的教育和考查。只有这样，才能使新发展的党员都是合乎党员条件的，不让一个不合乎党员条件的人入党。
    发展新党员，壮大党的组织，是每一个党员应该尽的义务。但是要将这一工作做好，必须有各级党委密切的领导，必须有党的支部经常地进行工作。每一个县委区委应该在农村工作队中，或者在区委工作人员中，挑选一批完全可靠的、在党的建设上有经验的、思想作风纯正的党员干部，来担任党的组织员，委托他们去帮助和指导党的支部做好这一工作；并且依靠他们去同新党员进行详细谈话，这对于指导发展党员的工作，有着重大的作用。现在，有些地方农村工作队中的党员干部，还没有注意做发展党的工作，有些党的支部还缺乏发展新党员的知识和经验，这就需要党的领导机关不断地帮助他们总结经验，从实际工作中逐渐学会这一工作，使发展新党员的工作，积极地有领导有计划地去进行。
