Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 26th: TASS issued the following statement regarding the recent Soviet testing of thermonuclear weapons:

　　Recently, the Soviet Union, according to the scientific research and experimental work plan in the field of atomic energy, tested new types of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen weapons). The tests fully confirmed the correctness of the corresponding scientific and technical calculations, demonstrating the important new achievements of Soviet scientists and engineers. The most recent hydrogen bomb explosion was the most powerful explosion ever conducted to date. In order to prevent the effects of radioactive materials, the explosion was carried out at high altitude. At the same time, extensive research was also conducted on how to protect people.

　　In view of the great fanfare in some Western countries regarding the aforementioned Soviet tests, TASS is authorized to declare:

　　The Soviet government has advocated and continues to advocate the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and the establishment of effective international supervision. Such a decision would make it possible to use atomic energy only for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union has proposed, both in the United Nations and at the recent Geneva Conference of the Four Foreign Ministers, proposals for the unconditional prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, but these proposals have not been accepted. The Soviet Union has also put forward proposals for the moral and political condemnation of atomic and hydrogen weapons. This proposal was also rejected by Western countries.

　　Although the Soviet Union conducted the above-mentioned tests to ensure its own security, it will continue, as in the past, to strive in the United Nations for agreements on the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the reduction of all other types of armaments, the further relaxation of international tensions, the establishment of trust between countries, and the maintenance and strengthening of universal peace.

　　塔斯社关于苏联最近试验热核子武器声明
    新华社二十七日讯　塔斯社莫斯科二十六日讯：塔斯社发表关于苏联最近试验热核子武器的声明如下：
    最近，苏联根据原子能方面的科学研究和实验工作计划，试验了新型的原子武器和热核子武器
  （氢武器）。试验充分证实了相应的科学和技术计算的正确，表明了苏联科学家和工程师的重要新成就。最近一次的氢弹爆炸，是直到现在为止曾经进行过的爆炸中最猛烈的一次。为了防止放射性物质的影响，爆炸是在高空进行的。同时对如何保护人的问题也进行了广泛的研究。
      鉴于某些西方国家中对苏联的上述试验大肆喧嚷，塔斯社受权声明：
    苏联政府过去和现在都主张禁止原子武器和氢武器，并且建立有效的国际监督。这样一种决定将会使得有可能把原子能只用于和平目的。苏联在联合国中和在不久以前举行的四国外交部长日内瓦会议上都曾经提出过关于无条件禁止原子武器和氢武器的建议，但是这些建议没有被接受。苏联也提出了关于在道义上和政治上谴责原子武器和氢武器的建议。这个建议也被西方国家拒绝了。
    苏联虽然为了保障自己的安全进行了上述的试验，但是仍然像过去一样将在联合国中争取在禁止原子武器和氢武器、裁减一切其他类型的军备、进一步缓和国际紧张局势、建立国与国之间的信任、维护和加强普遍和平这些方面达成协议。
