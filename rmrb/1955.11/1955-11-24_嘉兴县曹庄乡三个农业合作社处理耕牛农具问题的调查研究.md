　　Investigation and Study on the Handling of Farm Cattle and Implements by Three Agricultural Cooperatives in Caozhuang Township, Jiaxing County
　　Li Baiguan
    From June to July this year, the Jiaxing Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Zhejiang Province organized an investigation and research work team to conduct a survey of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement in Caozhuang Township, Jiaxing County. The focus of this investigation was on the handling of farm cattle and implements by the Baihuacun, Nanmaobang, and Wujiamuqiao agricultural production cooperatives. The Baihuacun and Nanmaobang cooperatives were established in the spring of 1954, and the Wujiamuqiao cooperative was established in the spring of 1955.

    I. Analysis of the Ownership of Farm Cattle and Implements by Members of Various Classes

    Among the 53 households in Baihuacun Cooperative, 12 were poor peasants, 13 were newly lower-middle peasants, 3 were old lower-middle peasants, 14 were newly upper-middle peasants, and 11 were old upper-middle peasants. Among the 29 households in Nanmaobang Cooperative, 10 were poor peasants, 11 were newly lower-middle peasants, 1 was an old lower-middle peasant, 4 were newly upper-middle peasants, and 3 were old upper-middle peasants. Among the 30 households in Wujiamuqiao Cooperative, 8 were poor peasants, 5 were newly lower-middle peasants, 2 were old lower-middle peasants, 6 were newly upper-middle peasants, 6 were old upper-middle peasants, and 3 were other laborers.

    Local farmers generally used cattle for plowing and irrigation. The main farm implements included waterwheels, farm boats, plows, harrows, cultivators, and rice barrels. Due to the economic development year by year after the land reform, it was quite common for peasants who had been liberated to jointly purchase farm cattle and implements, especially the upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants, whose production tools significantly increased. Therefore, looking at the overall situation of each cooperative, farm cattle and implements were sufficient. However, the ownership of farm cattle and implements among various classes was unbalanced. Poor peasants had none or very few. New and old lower-middle peasants also did not have all the main production tools. The upper-middle peasants among the new middle peasants basically had everything or were slightly more well off. The upper-middle peasants among the old middle peasants had more and better farm cattle and large farm implements.

    Due to the uneven surplus and shortage of farm cattle and implements among cooperative members of various classes, how to reasonably handle and use farm cattle and implements became a major economic relationship issue among cooperative members, mainly between middle and poor peasants. Whether this issue was handled appropriately was related to whether the cooperative could be consolidated and whether production could be improved.

    II. Several Methods for Handling Farm Cattle and Implements During the Establishment of Cooperatives

    When the three cooperatives were established, the method for handling farm cattle was to value them all and turn them over to public ownership. The farm implements were handled in the following four ways: 1. Valuation and Public Ownership. The main farm implements that were frequently used, such as waterwheels, farm boats, plows, harrows, and cultivators, were all valued and turned over to public ownership. 2. Private Ownership and Rental. In 1954, the Baihuacun and Nanmaobang cooperatives used rental as the main form of handling farm implements. Most of the waterwheels, farm boats, plows, harrows, and cultivators were rented. In 1955, the rented farm implements were limited to rice barrels, grain winnowers, silkworm-raising tools, grain mats, and other seasonal farm implements. 3. Free Use. For example, in Baihuacun Cooperative, small and medium-sized farm implements such as manure buckets and dustpans could be taken from the homes of middle peasants at will, without compensation. 4. Public Purchase and Public Use. Commonly used and easily damaged small and medium-sized farm implements (such as grain baskets) and parts of large farm implements (such as waterwheel boards and frames) were mostly purchased and used by the cooperative. In addition, small farm implements such as hoes were all brought and used by the members themselves.

    The situations and problems in the implementation of the three handling methods of valuation and public ownership, private ownership and rental, and free use are examined separately below:

      (1) Valuation and Public Ownership: When the three cooperatives were established, the amount of valuation for farm cattle and implements turned over to public ownership was very large. For example, in Baihuacun Cooperative, the valuation of farm cattle and implements after the expansion of the cooperative this spring totaled 46,800 jin of grain, which was stipulated to be paid off in three years. Twenty-five percent was paid in the first year, thirty-five percent in the second year, and forty percent in the third year. In 1955, 11,700 jin should be paid, but according to the original plan of extracting 3% of the total output as a public accumulation fund, it was estimated that at most 8,000 jin would be available, which was not enough to pay the current year's valuation. The shortfall would inevitably have to be deducted from the total income. This would not only make it impossible for the cooperative to expand its reproduction in the coming year, but also reduce the actual income of the members. The situations in Wujiamuqiao and Nanmaobang cooperatives were similar to this. Not only that, but because the valuation was too high and the burden on the cooperative was too heavy, the leading cadres of the cooperative, the poor peasant activists, and even some township cadres, in order to reduce the burden, adopted wrong practices such as lowering the valuation price and extending the payment period, which did not take into account the interests of the middle peasants. During the great development of cooperativization in the winter of 1954, a township cadre asked veterinary Zhu Wenxiang (a rich peasant) to uniformly assess the price of cattle for the cooperative, saying, "The valuation must be 20 to 30 yuan lower than the market price." Baihuacun Cooperative had the highest valuation for farm cattle in the whole township, but the price of each cow was still 10 to 30 yuan lower than the normal market price. In Wujiamuqiao Cooperative, the valuation price of 10 cows was 20% lower than the winter market price and 30% lower than the normal market price. The valuation of farm implements was often reasonable (according to the price of the supply and marketing cooperative), but the condition was greatly reduced. After the farm cattle were valued and entered the cooperative, each cooperative generally sold a large number of farm cattle and used the proceeds from the sale for production investment and purchasing farm implements. Baihuacun Cooperative sold seven heads, and Wujiamuqiao Cooperative sold four and a half heads. The cattle sold by the two cooperatives accounted for 38.3% of the total of 30 publicly owned cattle. As a result of the large number of cattle sold, there was a serious shortage of cattle power. This year, each cow in Wujiamuqiao Cooperative was responsible for cultivating 48 mu of paddy fields (in reality, it can only cultivate 35 to 40 mu), thus delaying the paddy field planting season.

    Most of the farm cattle that were valued and turned over to public ownership were not well fed. Some cattle were often not full and were already skin and bones due to overuse. Many upper-middle peasant cooperative members believed that it was useless to feed farm cattle that were valued and turned over to public ownership, so they were indifferent to this phenomenon. Many households without cattle believed that "it is the public's cattle anyway, and I don't have a share," so they did not care about the cattle either.

    It can be seen from the above situation that the method of valuation and public ownership is not suitable for new cooperatives that have only been established for one or two years and have weak economic strength.

    (2) Private Ownership and Rental: The scope of rental implemented by these three cooperatives was very small, limited to several seasonal small and medium-sized farm implements. The rental fee that was stipulated in the past was actually too low, often not enough to pay for the repair costs, let alone the depreciation costs. Therefore, the middle peasant cooperative members were not satisfied with the rental and thought it was better to turn them over to public ownership. Zhu Yinglin (old upper-middle peasant) of Baihuacun Cooperative said, "My family has six grain mats, and it costs at least 15 yuan to repair them once, but the rent received is only 12 yuan. If I lose 3 yuan every year, the principal will be gone, so I might as well give them to the cooperative for everyone to use for free." In 1954, this cooperative rented a farm boat from a cooperative member for eight months a year, with a rent of 96 yuan, or 12 yuan per month. The cooperative director, Li Maorong, said, "The rent for fifteen months can buy a boat." However, because it was used frequently, the original owner had to spend 102 yuan on repair costs in one year. Cooperative member Lu Jiaxi (new upper-middle peasant) said, "The rent sounds like a lot, but in reality, there is no reward."

    It can be seen from this that the key issue for new cooperatives to adopt the method of private ownership and rental for members' farm implements is whether the rent is reasonable. If the rent is too low and harms the interests of the original owner, they will regard the privately owned farm implements as a burden and will be unwilling to repair them, which will be detrimental to production. Of course, it is also wrong if the rent is too high and erodes labor remuneration, causing the poor peasants to suffer.

    (3) Free Use: When farmers were engaged in individual operations, they had the habit of borrowing certain small and medium-sized farm implements from each other to make up for each other's deficiencies, but this borrowing was based on personal feelings. After the establishment of the cooperative, this method did not work. Lou Guanfu, an old upper-middle peasant of Baihuacun Cooperative, had six dustpans in 1954, and four of them were damaged by the cooperative without any compensation. He said, "Since I have joined the cooperative, I have to rely on labor to eat anyway. It is better to let the state take control of the land, farm cattle, and farm implements, and we just take wages." This is a manifestation of dissatisfaction. Therefore, it can be definitely said that in agricultural cooperatives, the "free use" of farm implements is a wrong practice.

    III. Valuation and Joining the Cooperative, Paying Share Fund

    In July of this year, these three cooperatives, in accordance with the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, implemented a mutually beneficial policy and changed the method of handling farm cattle and implements. Instead of the original method of turning over farm cattle to public ownership after valuation, the method of valuing farm cattle and joining the cooperative and paying the share fund according to the amount of cultivated land was adopted. For the main farm implements, a combination of valuation for shares and private rental was adopted.

    The method adopted by these three cooperatives of valuing farm cattle and implements, joining the cooperative, and paying the share fund according to the amount of cultivated land was approved by cooperative members of all classes. This is because: First, everyone believed that this could meet the requirements of unified use and reduce the burden on the cooperative. The poor peasants were especially happy and said, "This way, we have a 'foundation' (referring to the fund), the burden is reduced, and the public accumulation fund can also be used to purchase farm implements." Second, this form not only changed the ownership system but also took into account the current private psychology of most cooperative members. The middle peasants who had farm cattle and implements said, "This method is good. Although the farm cattle and implements have entered the cooperative, we still have a share, which makes us feel at ease" (in the past, when they were valued and turned over to public ownership, they mistakenly thought they did not have a share). The poor peasants said, "The government has loans for the share fund, which helps us create a family property." Third, everyone believed that the burden was fair and reasonable. The middle peasants with more cattle power and farm implements reflected that if they did not join the cooperative, they would have to use farm cattle and implements to cultivate their land anyway, and it was reasonable to pay the share fund according to the amount of cultivated land. The poor peasants reflected that they also paid the share fund according to the amount of cultivated land, and they could stand tall and speak loudly. The above all shows that valuing farm cattle and implements for shares is more adaptable to the economic conditions and the level of awareness of the members of the new cooperatives than turning them over to public ownership completely, and it is easier for them to accept.

    However, at the beginning, cooperative members of all classes had various concerns about valuing farm cattle and implements for shares, the most prominent of which was the fear of making up the difference. The poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants with more land and less farm implements and labor were worried that they would not get any benefits after joining the cooperative but would first owe a lot of debt. The upper-middle peasants were afraid that the part that the poor peasants should make up would "never be repaid." These concerns were especially common and serious in Nanmaobang and Wujiamuqiao cooperatives, which had greater imbalances in the ownership of farm cattle and implements by various classes. This was not only an ideological problem but also a practical problem.

    When implementing the method of valuing for shares, the cooperatives, in addition to strengthening ideological education to eliminate the members' unnecessary concerns, also paid attention to grasping the following three points:

    First, the quantity of valuation for shares should be determined according to the production needs of the cooperative and the principle that most members can afford it. Anything that is not needed for the production of the cooperative should not enter the cooperative. Although it is needed for production, the part that exceeds the affordability of most members should not enter the cooperative, and the rental method should be adopted as much as possible. For example, in Baihuacun Cooperative, in addition to all 19 privately owned farm cattle of the members being valued for shares, only 29 of the 93 main farm implements in the entire cooperative were valued for shares, and the rest were privately rented. As a result, the share fund paid per mu of paddy field was 5.95 yuan, which was acceptable to the general members.

    Second, reasonably assess the valuation price and appropriately stipulate the number of years for making up the difference. The price of farm cattle valued for shares in the three cooperatives was reasonably adjusted through democratic discussion and consultation. The valuation was generally adjusted to be slightly higher than the winter market price. The local paddy fields generally plant grass seeds and spring flowers and have no winter plowing habits. There is also no sideline occupation that uses cattle power. From the time of frost fall to Qingming, all five months are leisure periods. At the same time, the wild grass is withered in winter, and the farm cattle all rely on feeding materials on the shed. A common farm cattle needs about 650 jin of feed grain during this period, which will be borne by the cooperative after joining the cooperative in autumn. The difference between the winter and spring cattle price is only this number. Therefore, the valuation price of farm cattle joining the cooperative in autumn and winter should be slightly higher than the winter market price, and it should not be the average of the winter and spring market prices, let alone the spring market price. Regarding the number of years for making up the shortfall in the share fund, the three cooperatives all stipulated through member discussion that they would make up the difference clearly in three years, and the poor and middle peasants basically agreed.

    Third, the National Bank should timely and correctly issue poor peasant cooperative fund loans to help poor peasants solve practical difficulties. How to do it in a timely manner? During the process of discussing and determining the quantity of farm cattle and implements valued for shares, adjusting the valuation price, and determining the number of years for making up the difference in these three cooperatives, the National Bank and the credit cooperative closely cooperated to carry out the issuance of poor peasant cooperative fund loans. The leading members to members in the cooperative deliberated and discussed the loan targets and quantities, made a plan, and, after approval from the higher level, announced it at the same time as announcing the amount of the share fund that should be paid by each household. How to do it correctly? The key lies in class analysis and implementing the class policy, using the method of combining leadership with the masses to formulate a distribution plan. Thirty-one households in these three cooperatives borrowed poor peasant cooperative fund loans, accounting for 27.7% of the total number of 112 households, with a total loan of 773 yuan (the sum of the share fund loan and the quota investment loan), averaging 25 yuan per household. The composition of the borrowing households was 23 poor peasants and 8 new lower-middle peasants. This is in line with the Party's class policy. The poor peasants were excited and satisfied, and some said, "There is an old saying: 'The stink doesn't stink when the big wind pours manure; the poor man's speech is not loud.' Now Chairman Mao has pulled us up, and we can speak loudly!" The middle peasants saw that the poor peasants had the strong support of the state, and they also dispelled the fear that the poor peasants would not be able to make up the difference, thus strengthening the unity of the poor and middle peasants and making the consolidation of the cooperative have a more reliable economic foundation.

    IV. On the Adoption of Private Rental Method

    When the township branch led the three cooperatives to correct the deviations in the implementation of the mutually beneficial policy, it first advocated that farm cattle should be adopted by the private rental method, and it publicized the benefits of adopting this transitional method for the new cooperatives, which are that the cooperative's burden is light, the cattle owner has fewer concerns, and the farm cattle are well raised. However, after discussion with the leading members and members of the cooperative, it was unanimously reflected that "it won't work." The leading members and activists of the cooperative said: Private rental does not have socialist elements, and after a few years, the cooperative is still empty-handed. They also believe that private rental, the cattle owner cherishes the cattle and cannot give full play to the cattle's potential, which is detrimental to production. The households without cattle (most of whom are poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants) believe that rental does not reduce the burden compared with valuation and public ownership. The households with cattle (most of whom are upper-middle peasants, and a few lower-middle peasants) have two fears about rental: First, they are afraid that the rent is too low and not enough to pay for the cattle grass (after joining the cooperative, the cattle grass has to be bought from the cooperative), and they have to pay for the cattle feeding effort (if they don't feed the cattle, they can get more work points in the cooperative); second, they are afraid that the cooperative will overuse the cattle, whip them arbitrarily, and the cattle will not live long, and the individual will bear a great risk, and it is not worth raising cattle if they don't farm privately. Jin Yutian, an old upper-middle peasant in Wujiamuqiao Cooperative, said, "If I have to rent out, I am not willing to pay half the cattle rent every year, who will be responsible if they die?" Therefore, the three cooperatives finally adopted the method of valuing for shares. From the above ideological reflections, there are the following three issues worth noting:

    First, when adopting the private rental method for farm cattle, it is necessary to solve the ideological understanding problems of the leading members and activists in the cooperative. They only see the advantages of valuation and public ownership in terms of unified management and increasing socialist elements, and they do not see the disadvantages of increasing the burden on the cooperative and increasing the concerns of the middle peasants, especially the many practical problems that have already occurred due to too early and too much valuation and public ownership. In Baihuacun and Nanmaobang cooperatives, when the cooperatives were established in the spring of 1954, all the farm cattle were valued and turned over to public ownership, and the members did not have any opinions at that time. As a result of the autumn harvest distribution, the members' income did not decrease as a result. Therefore, the cooperative cadres believed that their cooperative had a strong mutual aid group foundation, good economic conditions, and high member awareness, and there was no problem with valuation and public ownership. However, these two cooperatives also had two unique conditions at that time, in addition to having a better foundation and higher member awareness: One is that in the first year of the cooperative's establishment, the scale of the cooperative was small, and there was a bias towards "strong pulling strong", and the ownership of farm cattle and implements among the members was relatively balanced. For example, Nanmaobang Cooperative only had ten cooperative members, and every household had cattle power, so there were no major concerns when implementing valuation and public ownership. Second, the output of these two cooperatives in 1954 was high, and the rate of increase in production was large. The average output of rice per mu in Baihuacun Cooperative was 585 jin, and in Nanmaobang Cooperative was 467 jin, both of which increased by about 20% compared with 1953. Therefore, although the burden of valuation and public ownership was heavy, it still ensured that the members increased their actual income. However, after the expansion of the cooperative in the autumn of 1954, the situation changed greatly: First of all, it absorbed more poor peasants into the cooperative. For example, Nanmaobang Cooperative expanded from 10 households to 29 households. Among the 19 new cooperative members, 10 households were poor peasants with no cattle power at all, and another 5 households were new lower-middle peasants with insufficient cattle power. Secondly, the average output of the new cooperative members was lower. For example, the average output of 34 new cooperative members in Baihuacun Cooperative was only 400 jin, and the average output of 19 new cooperative members in Nanmaobang Cooperative was only more than 300 jin. Under this situation, valuing and turning over all the farm cattle and implements to public ownership would increase the burden on the members (mainly the poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants), affect the members' increase in actual income, and the concerns of the upper-middle peasants would also increase, thinking that they had been "oiled and suffered a loss." The leading cadres in the cooperative lacked research on this change in the situation, so they still insisted on valuation and public ownership after the expansion of the cooperative. In the newly established Wujiamuqiao Cooperative this year, the cooperative cadres and activists believed that valuation and public ownership was a high-level form, which was respectable to say, and that private rental was a low-level form, which was embarrassing to say, so they insisted on valuation and public ownership. In view of the above ideological situation, when promoting the private rental method for farm cattle in the new cooperatives, we should first strengthen policy education. On the one hand, we must affirm that valuation and public ownership is indeed conducive to unified management and increasing socialist elements, and we can do so in the future when conditions are met. On the other hand, we must analyze the specific situation, explain the advantages and role of adopting the transitional method of private rental in the new cooperatives in the first one or two years to correct understanding. But in the end, it must still be determined according to the voluntary will of the masses and the economic conditions of the cooperative.

    Second, the issue of rent level and burden weight. According to the investigation and calculation, a common farm cattle in the local area has a normal market price of 150 yuan. Each cattle needs 710 jin of feed grain per year, 1,000 jin of grain for cattle feeding labor remuneration (calculated according to the general social wage), and 200 jin of grain for the depreciation of the farm cattle itself (calculated over 10 years), totaling 1,910 jin for the whole year. Subtracting 100 dan of cattle dung, which is 200 jin of grain, that can be obtained from each cattle per year, the cost is still 1,710 jin. Calculated at 35 mu of land cultivated per cattle, the average burden per mu of land is 49 jin. The "contracting cultivation and contracting water" method (that is, households with cattle cultivate and irrigate for households without cattle) used by individual farmers in the local area for mutual adjustment of farm cattle requires 60 jin per mu of land, which also includes the depreciation cost of waterwheels, plows, harrows, and cultivators, as well as the remuneration for cultivation, harrowing, and water driving, totaling about 15 jin of grain. In this way, "contracting cultivation and contracting water" is not only no benefit, but also has to pay some capital. But in fact, because the purpose of raising cattle is to cultivate their own land, "contracting cultivation and contracting water" is just a convenient carry-on, so the cattle owner is still profitable, which is better than leaving the surplus cattle power idle anyway. According to this situation, if the rental method is implemented, to make the cattle owner not lose money and be slightly profitable, the cattle rent for a medium-sized farm cattle should be around 2,000 jin of grain. If the method of valuation and public ownership with three years of repayment is adopted, the same cattle will pay 50 yuan of valuation each year, 625 jin of grain, 710 jin of feed, and 1,200 jin of cattle raising remuneration (higher than the social wage), totaling 2,535 jin. Subtracting the cattle dung income, the actual payment is only 2,335 jin, which is only about 300 jin higher than the rent. In addition, unified use of valuation and public ownership, because it is convenient to allocate and the utilization rate can be improved, can bear the cultivation of 40 mu of land. Therefore, the cooperative's rental burden is actually not much lighter than valuation and public ownership, especially some households without cattle do not count the feed and effort in the cooperative's public raising, and mistakenly believe that the rental burden is even greater than valuation and public ownership. According to this situation, when promoting the farm cattle rental method in the local area, we should also strengthen the education of the leading members, activists, and poor peasants in the cooperative on uniting with the middle peasants and raising cattle well and doing a good job in production. It is not enough to carry out education by simply calculating the comparison account of the weight of the burden economically. Otherwise, even if the rental method is reluctantly promoted, they may lower the cattle rent, and the mutually beneficial policy will still not be implemented. Of course, unreasonably high cattle rent that erodes labor remuneration is not allowed. From the perspective of these three cooperatives, because two of them are already old cooperatives that have been running for two years, and although Wujiamuqiao Cooperative is newly established, it has better economic conditions and a higher level of mass awareness, and the members unanimously requested not to adopt the rental method, but to adopt the method of valuing for shares and paying the share fund, which we believe is also feasible.

    Third, the use and maintenance of farm cattle after renting. This is one of the two major concerns of households with cattle about private rental, and it also reflects the contradiction between private ownership and public use of farm cattle. The solution is to sign a cattle use contract at the same time as agreeing on the rent, stipulating the quota for each cattle to cultivate for the cooperative and fixing the cultivation area to eliminate the cattle owner's fear of unlimited use, and at the same time, to urge the cattle owner to raise strong farm cattle and ensure the completion of the quota.

    As long as the above three main problems are properly solved, the masses are willing to adopt the private rental method for farm cattle in the new cooperatives, especially in the first year of the establishment of the cooperative. When Fuju, Huoxing, and other cooperatives in Caozhuang Township corrected the mutually beneficial policy in July and August, they solved the above three problems, and the farm cattle and implements were changed from the original valuation and public ownership to private rental.

　　嘉兴县曹庄乡三个农业合作社处理耕牛农具问题的调查研究
　　李百冠
    中共浙江省嘉兴地委在今年六月到七月间，组织调查研究工作队派赴嘉兴县曹庄乡进行了农业互助合作运动情况调查。这中间，重点研究了百花村、南毛浜及吴家木桥三个农业生产合作社处理耕牛、农具的问题。百花村、南毛浜两社是一九五四年春建立的。吴家木桥社是一九五五年春建立的。
    一　各阶层社员占有耕牛、农具的情况分析
    百花村社五十三户中，贫农十二户，新下中农十三户，老下中农三户，新上中农十四户，老上中农十一户。南毛浜社二十九户中，贫农十户，新下中农十一户，老下中农一户，新上中农四户，老上中农三户。吴家木桥社三十户中，贫农八户，新下中农五户，老下中农二户，新上中农六户，老上中农六户，其他劳动者三户。
    当地普遍使用牛力耕田和灌溉。主要农具有水车、农船、犁、耙、耖、稻桶等几种。由于土地改革后经济逐年发展，翻身农民合伙添置耕牛、农具的现象相当普遍，特别是新中农中间的上中农生产工具显著增加，因此就各社总的情况看来，耕牛、农具都是够用的。但是各阶层之间占有耕牛、农具的情况是不平衡的。贫农没有或者占有很少。新、老下中农主要生产工具也还不齐备。新中农中间的上中农基本上齐备或者稍有宽余。老中农中间的上中农则占有较多较好的耕牛和大型农具。
    由于各阶层社员占有耕牛、农具余缺不等，如何合理地处理和使用耕牛农具，就成为社员之间、主要是中贫农之间的一个重大的经济关系问题。这个问题处理得是否恰当，关系合作社能否巩固，生产能否搞好。
    二　建社中处理耕牛、农具的几种办法
    三个社在建社的时候处理耕牛的办法是全部折价归公。农具则采取以下四种办法处理：一、折价归公。经常要用的主要农具，如水车、农船、犁、耙、耖等都折价归公。二、私有租用。一九五四年百花村、南毛浜二个社曾以租用作为处理农具的主要形式，水车、农船、犁、耙、耖等大部分是租用的。一九五五年租用的农具仅限于稻桶、谷风车、蚕具、谷垫等几种季节性使用的农具。三、白使白用。如百花村社对粪桶、畚斗等等中小农具是到中农家里任意取用，不给报酬。四、公买公用。凡经常使用、且易使坏的中小农具（如谷箩）及大型农具的零件（如水车的车板、车骨），大都是由社公买公用。此外，小农具如锄头等全部自带自用。
    对折价归公、私有租用、白使白用等三种处理办法在执行中的情况和问题，分别考察如下：
      （一）折价归公：三个社建社的时候耕牛、农具折价归公的价款数目都很庞大，例如百花村社今春扩社后的耕牛、农具价款共折谷四万六千八百斤，规定分三年付清。第一年付百分之二十五，第二年付百分之三十五，第三年付百分之四十。一九五五年应付一万一千七百斤，而按原定在总产量中提取百分之三的公积金，预计至多八千斤，不够支付当年应付价款，不足部分势必还要从总收入中扣除。这样，不但使社无法扩大来年再生产，而且要减少社员的实际收入。吴家木桥、南毛浜二个社的情况也和这类似。不仅如此，由于价款过多，社的负担过重，社的领导骨干、贫农积极分子、甚至有的乡干部为了减轻负担，就采取了压低折价价格，延长付款期限等不照顾中农利益的错误做法。一九五四年冬合作化大发展的时候，一个乡干部叫牛医朱文相（富农）统一给合作社评牛价“一定要比市价评低二、三十元”。百花村社是全乡耕牛折价最高的一个社，每头牛价也要低于常年市价十至三十元。吴家木桥社有十头牛的折价价格低于冬季市价百分之二十，比常年市价低百分之三十。农具的折价，往往是折价合理（按供销社牌价），但是大大压低了成色。耕牛折价入社后，各社普遍大量出卖耕牛，把卖得的价款用作生产投资及添买农具。百花村社卖了七头。吴家木桥社卖了四头半。两个社所卖耕牛占归公耕牛总数三十头的百分之三十八点三。大量卖牛的结果，引起牛力严重不足，今年吴家木桥社每头牛负担了四十八亩水田的耕作（实际只能够负担三十五亩至四十亩）。因此，推迟了水田耕种季节。
    折价归公的耕牛，多数喂养得不好。有的牛因为经常吃不饱，加上过度使用，已经瘦骨伶仃。不少上中农社员认为折价归公的耕牛反正喂不好，因此对这种现象漠不关心。不少无牛户认为“反正是公家的牛，我又没有分”，对牛也不关心。
    从上述情况中可以看出：折价归公办法对于才建立一两年、经济力量还很弱的新社不适宜采用。
    （二）私有租用：这三个社实行租用的范围很小，只限于几种季节性的中小农具。过去规定的租费实际上是偏低的，往往不够付修理费，更不包括折旧费，因此中农社员对租用不满意，认为不如归公好。百花村社朱英林（老上中农）说：“我家六条谷垫，修一次起码要花十五元，收进的租费只有十二元，要是年年贴三元，老本也要蚀光了，还是送给社里大家白用用算了。”这个社一九五四年向一个社员租用一只农船，一年需用八个月，租金九十六元，每月合十二元，社长李茂荣说：“十五个月租钱，可以买一只船了。”但是因使用得多，原主在
  一年当中要化修理费一百零二元，社员陆嘉锡（新上中农）说：“听听租费蛮大，实在是有罚无赏。”
    由此可见，新建社对社员农具采取私有租用办法，关键问题在于租费高低是否合理。如果租费过低，损害原主利益，他们就会把私有的农具看成累赘，不愿修理，这就对生产不利。当然，假如租费过高，侵蚀了劳动报酬，使贫农吃亏，也是错误的。
      （三）白使白用：农民在个体经营时，对某些中小农具有彼此借用，互通有无的习惯，但是这种借用是建筑在私人感情基础上的，办社后这种办法就行不通了。百花村社的老上中农娄关福一九五四年有六只畚斗给社里用坏了四只，毫无补偿，他说：“既然入了社，反正要靠劳动力吃饭，土地、耕牛、农具还是都让国家掌握了去好，我们只要拿工资分就行。”这就是一种不满情绪的流露。因此，可以肯定地说：在农业合作社内，农具“白使白用”是一种错误的做法。
　  三折价入社，摊纳股份基金
    今年七月间，这三个社都根据中共中央指示精神，贯彻执行了互利政策，改变了耕牛农具的处理办法。对耕牛入社采用了以折价入社、按入社田亩摊纳股份基金办法代替了原来的折价归公办法；对主要农具入社兼用折价入股和私有租用两种办法。
    这三个社采取的耕牛、农具折价入社、按入社田亩多少摊纳股份基金的办法，各阶层社员都是赞成的，这是因为：第一，大家认为这样做既能适应统一使用的要求，又能减轻社的负担，贫农尤其高兴，都说：这样有了“底子”（指基金），负担就减轻了，公积金也能用来添买农具了。第二，这种形式，既改变了占有制，又照顾了目前多数社员的私有心理。有耕牛农具的中农说：这个办法好，耕牛、农具虽入了社，我们仍旧有一份，表示放心
  （过去折价归公，他们误认为自己没有份了）。贫农说：搞股份基金政府有贷款，倒是帮我们创了一份家当。第三，大家认为负担公平合理。牛力和农具多的中农反映：不入社，自己种田也要用耕牛农具，照田亩负担股份基金是合理的。贫农反映：我们也照田亩交上股份基金，胸脯也挺得起来，话也讲得响了。以上都说明耕牛、农具折价入股，比完全折价归公更能适应新建社的经济条件和社员觉悟水平，更容易被社员们接受。
    但是在开始的时候，各阶层社员对耕牛农具折价入股也有种种顾虑，最突出的是怕找补。贫农和土地较多而农具、劳力较少的下中农担心入了社好处未得，倒先欠了一身债；上中农却怕贫农应找出部分“千年不还”。这些顾虑在南毛浜、吴家木桥这两个各阶层耕牛农具占有不平衡性较大的社，尤其普遍而严重。这不仅是思想问题，也是实际问题。
    各社在实行折价入股办法的时候，除了加强思想教育，解除社员不必要的顾虑外，还注意掌握了以下三点：
    第一，折价入股的数量，应根据社内生产需要和多数社员能够出得起的原则来确定。凡不为社的生产所需的就不入社；虽为生产需要，但是超过了多数社员的负担能力的一部分也不入社，尽量同时采取租用办法。如百花村社，除社员私有的耕牛十九头全部折价入股外，全社九十三件主要农具中只有二十九件折价入股，其余的私有租用。结果每亩水田摊纳基金五元九角五，一般社员都能接受。
    第二，合理评定折价价格，适当规定找补年限。三个社折价入股的耕牛价格，都经过民主讨论协商，作了合理的调整，折价一般都调整到略高于冬季市价。当地水田普遍种草籽、春花，无冬耕习惯，又无使用牛力的副业，从霜降到清明五个月全为休闲期间；同时，冬季野外草枯，耕牛全部依靠上棚喂料，一头普通耕牛这一期间需饲料折谷六百五十斤左右，秋季入社后就要由社负担，而冬春牛价差额也不过此数。因此，秋冬入社的耕牛折价价格以略高于冬季市价为宜，不宜取冬春市价的平均数，更不应该按照春季市价。关于股份基金余缺部分的找补年限，三个社都经社员讨论规定分三年找补清楚，贫、中农都基本上同意。
    第三，国家银行及时地正确地发放贫农合作基金贷款，帮助贫农解决实际困难问题。怎样做到及时呢？这三个社在商定折价入社的耕牛农具数量、调整折价价格和确定找补年限的过程中，国家银行和信用合作社紧密配合进行了贫农合作基金贷款的发放工作。社内由骨干到社员酝酿讨论贷款的对象和数量，作出方案，经过上级批准，在按户公布应摊纳找补的股份基金金额的同时，予以公布。怎样做到正确呢？关键在于阶级分析，贯彻执行阶级政策，用领导同群众相结合的方法来制定发放方案。这三个社借到贫农合作基金贷款的有三十一户，占总户数一百十二户的百分之二十七点七，共得贷款七百七十三元（股份基金贷款和定额投资贷款两部分的总和），每户平均二十五元。借款户的成份是贫农二十三户，新下中农八户。这样做，是合乎党的阶级政策的，贫农兴奋、满意，有的说：“自古有句话：‘大风浇粪不臭；穷人讲话不响。’现在毛主席把我们拉了起来，可讲得响话啦！”中农看到贫农有了国家的大力扶持，也解除了怕贫农找补不起的顾虑，因而加强了贫中农的团结，使社的巩固有了更加牢靠的经济基础。
  　四　关于采用私有租用办法
    乡支部在领导这三个社纠正执行互利政策的偏差时，曾经首先提倡耕牛采取私有租用办法，并且宣传了新建社采取这一过渡办法的好处是社里负担轻，牛主顾虑少，耕牛养得好。但是经过社内骨干和社员讨论后，一致反映“行不通”。社的领导骨干和积极分子说：私有租用，就没有社会主义因素了，搞了几年，社里还是两手空空。他们又认为：私有租用，牛主顾惜牛，不能发挥牛的潜在力，对生产不利。无牛户（多数是贫农和新下中农）认为租用并不能比折价归公减轻负担。有牛户（大都是上中农，也有少数下中农）对租用有两怕：一怕租费低，不够付牛草钱（入了社，牛草是要向社里买的），还要倒贴喂牛功夫（不喂牛可在社里多得工分）；二怕社里对牛过度使用，任意鞭打，牛活不长，个人背了很大的风险，而且私人又不种田，养牛犯不着。吴家木桥社老上中农金玉田说：“如要租用，每年出我半只牛租金，我也不愿，弄死了算谁的？”因此，三个社最后采用了折价入股办法。从以上各种思想反映中，有以下三个问题值得注意：
    第一，采用耕牛私有租用办法的时候，要解决社内骨干和积极分子的思想认识问题。他们只看到折价归公有利于统一经营和增长社会主义因素的一面，看不到因此加重了社的负担和增加了中农顾虑的一面，特别是看不到因过早过多地折价归公已经发生的许多实际问题。在百花村，南毛浜两个社，
  一九五四年春建社的时候，耕牛是全部折价归公的，当时社员确实没有意见。秋收分配结果，社员也并未因此减少收入。因此社干部就认为自己的社互助组基础强，经济条件好，社员觉悟高，折价归公没有问题。但是这两个社当时除了基础较好，社员觉悟较高之外，还有两个特有条件：一是在建社的第一年，社的规模小，并且有“强拉强”的偏向，社员之间耕牛农具的占有比较平衡。如南毛浜社社员只有十户社员，户户都有牛力，因此实行折价归公时没有大的顾虑。二是这两个社一九五四年产量高，增产率大。百花村社水稻每亩平均产量为五百八十五斤，南毛浜社为四百六十七斤，均比一九五三年增产二成左右，因此折价归公的负担虽重，仍保证了社员增加实际收入。但是一九五四年秋天扩社后，情况起了很大变化：首先是吸收了较多的贫农入社，如南毛浜社由十户扩大到二十九户，在十九户新社员中，有十户是贫农，毫无牛力，另有五户是新下中农，牛力不足。其次是新社员的平均产量较低，如百花村社三十四户新社员的平均产量仅四百斤，南毛浜社十九户新社员的平均产量仅三百多斤。在这种情况下把耕牛农具全部折价归公，就要加重社员（主要是贫农和下中农）的负担，影响社员增加实际收入，而且上中农的顾虑也加重了，认为“被揩了油，吃了亏”。社内领导骨干对这种情况的变化缺乏研究，因此扩社后仍坚持要折价归公。在今年新建的吴家木桥社，社干部和积极分子认为折价归公是高级形式，说出去体面；私有租用是低级形式，说出去难听，因此硬要折价归公。针对上述思想情况，在新建社内推行耕牛私有租用办法的时候，应该首先加强政策教育。一方面要肯定折价归公确实有利于统一经营和增长社会主义因素，将来具备了条件可以这样做，另一方面要分析具体情况，讲清新建社在一、二年内采取私有租用这种过渡办法的好处和作用，以端正认识。但是最后仍要根据群众自愿和社的经济条件确定。
    第二，租金高低和负担轻重问题。据调查计算，当地一头普通的耕牛，常年市价一百五十元。每头牛每年需饲料折谷七百十斤，喂牛人工报酬一千斤谷（按社会一般工资计算），耕牛本身的折旧费每年二百斤谷（以十年计算），合计全年成本一千九百十斤，扣除一头牛全年可得牛粪一百担、折谷二百斤，尚需成本一千七百十斤。以每头牛耕地三十五亩计算，每亩田平均负担四十九斤。当地个体农民互相调剂耕牛所采用的“包耕包水”（即有牛户替无牛户耕田和灌溉）办法，每亩田需费六十斤，其中还包括水车、犁、耙、耖的折旧费及耕、耙和赶水工夫的报酬共约十五斤谷在内。这样看来，“包耕包水”不但没有好处，还要贴些本。但是事实上因为养牛的目的在于自己耕田，“包耕包水”只是就便捎带，所以牛主仍是有利可图的，无论如何比把多余牛力空起来要好。根据这一情况，如实行租用办法，要使牛主不吃亏并且略有利，一头中等耕牛的牛租要在二千斤谷左右。如采取折价归公、三年还清的办法，同样一头牛，每年付折价款五十元、折谷六百二十五斤，饲料七百十斤，养牛报酬一千二百斤（比社会工资高些），共两千五百三十五斤，减去牛粪收入实际只要付出二千三百三十五斤，比租金只高三百斤左右。另外，折价归公统一使用，因为便于调配，利用率可以提高，能负担四十亩田的耕作。因此采取耕牛私有租用的办法，社的租金负担实际上并不比折价归公轻多少，特别是有些无牛户在社里公养不算饲料和工夫账，误认为租用的负担比折价归公还要大。根据这一情况，在当地推行耕牛租用办法，还应该加强对社内骨干、积极分子和贫农进行团结中农及养好牛、搞好生产的教育，单纯从经济上算负担轻重的对比账去进行教育还是不够的。否则即使勉强推行了租用办法，他们也可能会压低牛租，仍然不能贯彻执行互利政策。当然，不合理地过高规定牛租，侵蚀劳动报酬，也是不能容许的。从这三个社来看，因为其中有两个社已经是办了二年的老社，吴家木桥社虽然是新建的，但是经济条件较好，群众觉悟较高，社员一致要求不采取租用办法，而采取折价入社、摊纳股份基金的办法，我们认为也是可行的。
    第三，耕牛租用后的使用和保养问题。这是有牛户对私有租用的两大顾虑之一，也反映了耕牛私人占有同公共使用之间的矛盾。解决的办法，是在议定租金的同时订好用牛合同，规定每头牛为社耕作的定额，固定耕作区，以解除牛主怕无限度使用的顾虑，同时也能督促牛主养壮耕牛，保证完成定额。
    只要妥善地解决了上述三个主要问题，在新建社内，特别是建社第一年，群众是乐意采取耕牛私有租用办法的。曹庄乡的福聚、火星等社在七、八月间端正互利政策的时候，解决了上述三个问题，耕牛农具由原来的折价归公改为私有租用。
