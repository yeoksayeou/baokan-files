In Mupian Township, Beiliu County, Guangxi Province, the work of establishing agricultural production cooperatives has come to an end. Ten new co-ops have been established in the township (including three branch co-ops), and seven old co-ops have been expanded. However, of the original 59 mutual aid teams in the township, after 380 households of team members joined the co-ops, the remaining 86 households who did not join the co-ops have become individual farmers because there was no one to lead them. At the same time, no one has been leading the original 75 individual farmers in the township to organize mutual aid teams. These farmers feel that the cooperative movement has been very cold towards them. In fact, most of them urgently need to reorganize the mutual aid teams or organize new mutual aid teams.

Why is there no one to lead them to reorganize the mutual aid teams? The secretary of the township's Party branch said: "I can't even take care of the co-ops, how can I take care of the mutual aid teams!" The township head also said: "Who can manage this matter!" It turns out that when the township was carrying out cooperative planning, it did not make arrangements for these farmers, nor did it designate anyone to lead the mutual aid teams, thus neglecting them. Only caring about building co-ops and not caring about mutual aid teams and individual farmers; only caring about today and not caring about tomorrow, this will create difficulties for the next step in the development of the co-ops.

　  不能只管建社不管互助组
    广西省北流县木棉乡建立农业生产合作社的工作已经告一段落。全乡建立了十个新社（内有三个是分社），扩大了七个老社。可是，这个乡原有的五十九个互助组的三百八十户组员入了社以后，还有没有入社的八十六户组员，因为无人领导，都变成单干户了；同时这个乡原有的七十五户个体农民，也没有人领导他们组织互助组。这些农民感觉合作化高潮对他们很冷落。其实，他们当中的大多数人，是迫切需要把互助组整顿起来或组织互助组的。
    为什么没有人领导他们把互助组整顿好呢？这个乡的党支部书记说：“顾社都顾不过来，哪还能顾互助组！”乡长也说：“谁能管得到这个事！”原来这个乡在进行合作化规划的时候，没有对这些农民作安排，也没有指定专人领导互助组，这样就把他们冷落了。只管建社，不管互助组和个体农民；只管今天，不管明天，这会给合作社下一步发展造成困难的。
