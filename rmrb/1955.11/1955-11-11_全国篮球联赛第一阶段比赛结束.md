National Basketball League First Stage Competition Concludes

　　The first stage of the 1955 National Basketball League's women's and men's competitions concluded on the 9th and 10th respectively. This league began on October 25th, with a total of nine women's basketball teams and fourteen men's basketball teams participating. The competition adopted a single round-robin system, with a total of one hundred and twenty-seven games played. From these games, it can be seen that the physical strength, speed, and basketball skill levels of many athletes have significantly improved compared to when they participated in the basketball league in Beijing last October.

　　A total of thirty-six games were played in the women's group of the league, with the Southwest Sports College women's basketball team winning the championship. In these days of competition, most of the teams adopted an active and proactive fast-break tactic in attack. After receiving the ball, the players strived to pass the ball to the basket for shooting or cut-in layups to score in the fastest speed and in the shortest time. The improvement of the athletes' shooting skills is also very prominent. Many athletes have skillfully mastered shooting methods with higher technical requirements such as one-handed shooting, jump shooting, or shooting during movement, and the accuracy rate is quite high. Some athletes can also make more difficult large-stride layup shooting actions.

　　A total of ninety-one games were played in the men's group, with the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shenyang men's basketball team winning the championship. This team only lost one game after playing against the other thirteen teams in the league. The Northeast Sports College men's basketball team won the second place. This team was last place when it participated in the basketball league in Beijing last October, but this time it achieved a good record of eleven wins and two losses. (Attached picture)

　　全国篮球联赛第一阶段比赛结束
    一九五五年全国篮球联赛第一阶段的女子组和男子组的竞赛已在九日和十日先后结束。这次联赛是从十月二十五日开始的，参加联赛的共有九个女子篮球队和十四个男子篮球队，比赛采用单循环制，共进行了一百二十七场比赛。从这些比赛中可以看出许多运动员的体力、速度和篮球技术水平，比去年十月间在北京参加篮球联赛时都有了显著的提高。
    联赛中女子组的比赛共进行了三十六场，西南体育学院女子篮球队，取得了冠军。在这些天的比赛中，大多数的球队在进攻时都采用了积极、主动的快攻战术，队员在得球后都争取用最快的速度、在最短的时间内把球传到篮下投篮或切入上篮得分。运动员的投篮技术水平的提高也是很突出的。许多运动员都较熟练地掌握了单手投篮、跳起投篮或进行中投篮等技术水平要求较高的投篮方法，而且命中率都相当高。有些运动员还能作出较困难的跨大步上篮的投篮动作。
    男子组的比赛共进行了九十一场，中国人民解放军驻沈阳部队男子篮球队获得了冠军。这个队在联赛中同其他十三个队交锋以后，只输了一场。获得亚军的是东北体育学院男子篮球队。这个队去年十月在北京参加篮球联赛的时候还是最后一名，这次取得了胜十一场败两场的良好成绩。（附图片）
