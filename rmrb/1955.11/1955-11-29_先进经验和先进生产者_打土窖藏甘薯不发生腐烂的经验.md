Experience in Storing Sweet Potatoes in Underground Cellars Without Rotting

Member Liu Yongkui of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taihua Township, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, recently revealed his family's sixty years of experience in storing sweet potatoes in underground cellars without rotting. Many people are now learning from this experience.

Liu Yongkui is sixty-six years old this year. Since his grandfather's time, his family has stored five to six thousand catties of sweet potatoes in earth cellars every year, for as long as half a year. Liu Yongkui introduced that his family's experience in building earth cellars to store sweet potatoes mainly focuses on maintaining dryness and cleanliness inside the cellar, ensuring the stored sweet potatoes are fresh and intact, and frequently opening the cellar for inspection. He said that the cellar site is best chosen in a place that is sunny, well-ventilated, with dry soil that does not get waterlogged. If using an old cellar, a few days before storing sweet potatoes each year, use a short hoe or knife handle to scrape off about an inch of moldy soil and dirt from the four walls of the cellar. Then, depending on whether it is drizzly or dry, either burn the cellar or soak the cellar, respectively. The purpose of burning or soaking the cellar is to disinfect and dehumidify, so that the temperature inside the cellar is suitable. In dry weather, the temperature inside the cellar is high, so five to seven days before storing the sweet potatoes, the old soil inside the cellar should be scraped away, then water should be poured on the four walls and bottom of the cellar, soaking it for a day or two. After the water dries, scrape off an inch of soil from the bottom of the cellar, then crush the loose sandstone and gravel into fine pieces, and sprinkle it inside the cellar, about an inch thick, then you can store the sweet potatoes. In drizzly weather, the humidity inside the cellar is high, so four to five days before storing the sweet potatoes, the old soil inside the cellar should be scraped away, then use ten to fifteen catties of rice straw or sesame stalks to burn the cellar. The next day, similarly, crush the loose sandstone and gravel into fine pieces and sprinkle it inside the cellar, then store the sweet potatoes inside the cellar. Liu Yongkui said that sweet potatoes that have been cut, broken, or have their skin bruised must not be put into the cellar. Three days after the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar, when some of the moisture in the sweet potatoes evaporates, the cellar door must be opened immediately; if the cellar door is opened one or two days late, some of the moisture evaporated from the sweet potatoes will still penetrate the sweet potatoes, and the sweet potatoes will easily rot. After the sweet potatoes are put into the cellar, put a handful of rice straw on top to absorb the moisture inside the cellar. Afterwards, open the cellar door every morning and close it every evening for more than thirty consecutive days. Each time the cellar is opened, the rice straw is changed, and the wet sweet potatoes are picked out. When the sweet potatoes have sprouted, the cellar can be opened every few days, but the cellar cannot be opened on windy, rainy, or snowy days. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 先进经验和先进生产者　打土窖藏甘薯不发生腐烂的经验

　　打土窖藏甘薯不发生腐烂的经验
    四川省南部县太华乡红光农业生产合作社社员刘永奎最近公开了他家六十年来打土窖藏甘薯不发生腐烂的经验，现在已有许多人在学习这个经验。
      刘永奎今年六十六岁。从他祖父的时候起，他家每年都要用土窖藏五、六千斤甘薯，达半年之久。刘永奎介绍他家打土窖藏甘薯的经验主要是注意窖内干燥清洁，收藏的甘薯要新鲜完好和勤开窖进行检查。他说，窖址最好选择在向阳透光、空气流通、土质干燥不浸水的地方。如果用旧窖，每年要在藏甘薯前几天，用短锄或刀把窖内四周铲去厚一寸左右的霉土脏物。再根据霪雨或干旱的情况，分别烧窖或浸窖。烧窖、浸窖的目的，是为了消毒去湿、使窖内冷热合适。干旱的时候，窖内热度高，因此要在藏甘薯前五天到七天，把窖内旧土铲去，然后在窖内四周和窖底泼水，浸一两天，等水干后铲去窖底一寸厚的土，再把质地较松的砂石捶细，撒在窖内，大约撒一寸厚，就可以藏甘薯。霪雨的时候，窖内湿气大，因此要在藏甘薯前四天到五天，把窖内旧土铲去，再用十斤到十五斤稻草或芝麻秆烧一下窖，第二天同样把质地较松的砂石捶细撒在窖内，然后把甘薯藏在窖内。刘永奎说，被挖断、挖烂或撞伤皮的甘薯切忌下窖。甘薯下窖三天，甘薯中的一部分水份蒸发出来的时候，要立即开窖门；如迟一两天才开窖门，从甘薯中蒸发出来的一部分水份仍要侵入甘薯，甘薯就容易腐烂。甘薯下窖以后，要在上面放一把稻草，吸收窖内湿气。以后每天早开晚盖连续三十多天。每开一次窖，就换一次稻草，拣一次湿甘薯。等甘薯长了芽子，就可以隔几天开一次窖，但在刮风、下雨、下雪的日子不能开窖。（新华社）
