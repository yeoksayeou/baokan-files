In the past, at the beginning of each month, long queues would form in front of grain supply points in cities like Taiyuan and Yangquan in Shanxi Province. This crowding phenomenon began in the spring of this year; even after the implementation of the grain rationing system, this phenomenon was not eliminated. Some grain workers did not actively investigate the reasons for this chaotic situation and improve grain supply work, but instead self-complacently said: "Queuing to buy grain is unavoidable."

Is this phenomenon really unchangeable? Recently, Shanxi Province conducted inspections of this situation in various cities and found that the reasons for the crowding phenomenon at the beginning of each month in the past were, on the one hand, due to some residents fearing that if they bought grain late, they would not be able to buy the types of grain they needed, and also fearing that if they bought late, their grain purchase quantity would be reduced; on the other hand, it was also due to the unreasonable arrangement and poor supply methods of grain supply points in some cities. In order to improve grain supply work, various cities implemented methods such as arranging grain purchase dates by district and regular grain purchases, so that residents' grain purchase times were staggered, avoiding crowding. The grain departments also adjusted the grain supply points, so that the number of households, population, and supply quantity of each supply point were adapted to the number of times residents purchased grain and their purchasing habits. At the same time, various cities further widely carried out publicity work, eliminating the doubts of some residents about grain supply work.

By early November, the crowding phenomenon in grain purchases in various cities in Shanxi had been completely eliminated. It can be seen that the saying that "queuing is inevitable" is just an irresponsible excuse to the people.

　  一种借口
    过去每到月初，山西省太原、阳泉等城市的粮食供应点的门前，就排起了一串串长长的购粮队伍。这种拥挤现象从今年春季起就发生了；实行粮食定量供应办法以后，这种现象也没有消除。有些粮食工作人员不去积极研究发生这种混乱现象的原因和改进粮食供应工作，反而心安理得地说：“买粮站队是不可避免的。”
    这种现象真的是不可改变的吗？最近山西省各城市对这种情况作了检查，发现过去每到月初发生购粮拥挤现象的原因，一方面是由于某些居民怕买晚了，买不到自己所需要的粮食品种，还怕买晚了，扣减自己的购粮数量；另一方面也由于某些城市的粮食供应点的摆布不合理，供应方法不善。为了改进粮食供应工作，各城市实行了分片安排购粮日期、定期购粮的办法，使居民的购粮时间错开，避免拥挤现象的发生。粮食部门对粮食供应点也作了调整，使每个供应点的供应户数、人口、供应数量同居民购粮次数和购粮习惯相适应。和这同时，各城市又进一步广泛地开展了宣传工作，消除了某些居民对粮食供应工作的疑虑。
    到十一月初旬，山西各城市中购粮拥挤现象已经完全消除。可见，那种认为“排队不可避免”的说法，只是对人民不负责任的一种借口。
