    Qian Xuesen, the famous Chinese scientist who was illegally detained by the American government for five years, and who, thanks to the care and support of the people and government of the motherland, has finally returned to the embrace of the motherland, arrived in Beijing on October 28th.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen graduated from Shanghai Jiaotong University in 1934 and went to the United States in 1935 to study aeronautical engineering and aerodynamics. He studied and researched at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology, earning a doctorate and serving as a professor and lecturer at both schools. From the second half of 1949, he served as the head of the "Guggenheim Jet Propulsion Laboratory" at the California Institute of Technology, leading graduate students in research and teaching. In the United States, he published many important academic papers, such as the theory of rockets and other jet propulsion, elasticity, the dynamics of compressible gases, the dynamics of rarefied gases, as well as combustion problems and general automatic control theory. This scientist, only forty-three years old this year, is recognized as one of the leading scholars in the field of mechanics and applied mathematics. His work has a positive impact on engineering science.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen is a scientist who loves his motherland. Five years ago, he was preparing to return to China with the fervent desire to participate in the construction of the motherland. But before he had left the borders of the United States, he was illegally detained by the American government. During those long five years, he lived a very painful life of unfreedom and torment. It was not until August 4th of this year that he received a notice from the U.S. Immigration Service saying that he was allowed to leave the United States. On September 17th, he and his wife, Jiang Ying, along with their two children and more than twenty Chinese students, left the United States on the "President Cleveland" steamer and returned to the motherland via Hong Kong. Even before this return, they were subjected to unreasonable searches and surveillance by the U.S. Immigration Service and the FBI.

    With indignation, Dr. Qian Xuesen recounted to us the persecution he had suffered from the American government for the past five years for demanding to return to his country.

    In August 1950, Dr. Qian Xuesen prepared to leave the United States on a Canadian Pacific Airlines plane. He packed many of his scientific books and notes from his research work into boxes and handed them over to an American moving company for shipment back to China. But he suddenly received a notice from the U.S. Immigration Service stating that he was prohibited from leaving the country; all of his scientific books and research notes were illegally opened and inspected by agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and were all seized by U.S. Customs. Under this unreasonable persecution, he had no choice but to cancel his plane ticket. In early September of that year, he received another notice from the U.S. Immigration Service stating that he was a Communist and was attempting to transport secret scientific documents back to China, and therefore, he was to be deported. At this time, he was illegally arrested and sent to an Immigration Service detention center.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen was detained in a U.S. Immigration Service detention center as a prisoner for fifteen days and was subjected to illegal interrogation. Finally, because of the protests from faculty and students at the California Institute of Technology and from various sources, he was allowed to be bailed out by the school for $15,000.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen painfully recalled that the fifteen days of detention caused irreparable damage to his mental and physical health. At that time, the personnel of the U.S. Immigration Service tormented him every day, forbidding him from talking to anyone. Every night, they would run into the detention center every ten minutes to check on him, turn on the lights, and see what he was doing, making it impossible for him to rest. Because of all kinds of torment, his weight decreased by thirty pounds in those fifteen days!

    All of his scientific books and research notes were unreasonably detained by U.S. Customs for three years. Finally, it was proven that these books and notes were completely public and contained no secrets at all, proving that the Immigration Service's claim that he was attempting to transport secret scientific documents was completely slanderous and fabricated. When U.S. Customs returned these scientific books to him, they shamelessly demanded three years of storage fees.

    After Dr. Qian Xuesen was bailed out of the Immigration Service detention center, the matter was not over. The U.S. Immigration Service illegally restricted his freedom, requiring him to report to the Immigration Service once a month and restricting him from leaving Los Angeles County. Agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation also frequently monitored him, often entering his laboratory and residence. His letters and phone calls were also checked. Some of his friends were questioned by U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation agents just for making a phone call to him. During these five years, in order to reduce trouble for his friends, he often found himself isolated from them. But he did not yield; he never stopped hoping to return to the embrace of the motherland. For the convenience of returning home, he only signed one-year contracts for the houses he rented. Therefore, he moved many times in five years. The furniture in his home was also very simple. His seven-year-old boy and five-year-old girl also knew that far away from America—in China—their grandfather and grandmother were thinking of them. During these five years, because of his longing for the motherland, Dr. Qian Xuesen also read with excitement and emotion some news about the motherland's prosperity and large-scale construction. He secretly planned how to dedicate himself to the construction of the motherland, deciding to better study some specialized scientific and technological fields before he could return to the country, expand the foundation of his knowledge, and better contribute his strength after returning home.

    After arriving in Guangzhou on October 8th, he was immediately warmly welcomed by the people of the motherland and the scientists of the motherland. He set foot on the land of the motherland and breathed the air of the motherland, how free and happy he felt! This was the day he had been hoping for every moment for five years. As he stood on the warm land of the motherland, he couldn't help but think of many other students who, like him, had been innocently persecuted in the United States and were still being obstructed from returning to the motherland smoothly.

    Since returning to the motherland, he has felt that everything is exceptionally fresh. He has spent nearly a month in excitement. In Guangzhou, he visited the Peasant Movement Training Institute, where Chairman Mao once lectured in 1926, and the Exhibition of Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements, which gave him many new understandings. When he was in the United States, he could only see some fragmentary news about the construction of the motherland; he could not see more books and newspapers about the motherland. Now, he is hungrily reading books reflecting the great construction of the motherland. In the short time since returning home, he has already finished reading books about the Five-Year Plan and the Constitution, and is preparing to carefully study "Selected Works of Mao Zedong."

    After arriving in Shanghai, he happily reunited with his father and sister, whom he had been separated from for many years. From the conversations with his father and sister, he also keenly felt the changes in all aspects of the motherland. His seventy-four-year-old father specially bought a set of his favorite reproduced "Famous Chinese Paintings of Past Dynasties" to welcome him. October 13th was the seventh birthday of his son, Xiao Yonggang, and the whole family happily ate noodles. He also went to Hangzhou, his hometown, to sweep the grave of his deceased mother.

    In Shanghai, he ran to visit his alma mater, Jiaotong University, where he studied, and was warmly welcomed by the faculty and students. When visiting Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, he was warmly surrounded by the students. He was very moved to see the enthusiasm of the young students of New China for learning and knowledge, and to see the students' beautiful learning environment. When visiting factories in Shanghai and Hangzhou, he saw for the first time the happy lives and high work enthusiasm of the workers of the motherland, and saw the various machines made by the Chinese workers themselves, which he had dreamed of realizing for many years.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen saw many old friends and classmates in Shanghai and Beijing whom he had not seen for many years. He found that they were all working and studying vigorously. During the summer vacation of 1947, he returned to China for three months. At that time, it was the dark era of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and he saw the depressed situation of Yin Hongzhang, a botanist who had studied with him in the United States. At that time, Yin Hongzhang was unable to carry out scientific research work. But this time, he saw Yin Hongzhang conducting scientific research work intensively at the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and his full working spirit moved him extraordinarily. He visited some research institutes, which made him feel the care and importance the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government attached to scientific undertakings and scientists. These were all scenes he had never seen before. When he saw that China's scientific research work, like other undertakings, was flourishing, he naturally thought of the fact that scientific research work in the United States, like other undertakings in the United States, was on a declining path. In the United States today, except for some scientific departments related to war that can get government support and development, many scientific departments cannot get development. Some righteous scientists, unwilling to go against their conscience and use their research results to harm mankind, would rather leave the laboratory to plant flowers or decorate houses as a spiritual sustenance.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen saw the various new atmospheres in the motherland, and compared them with the facts he saw in the United States, which made him feel particularly that the motherland has an infinitely bright future. Early in the morning of the second day after he arrived in Beijing, he took his wife and two children to see that great place they had missed day and night in the United States—the majestic Tiananmen, where the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, had announced the birth of the People's Republic of China. Standing on Tiananmen Square, he felt even more the greatness and loveliness of the motherland.

    Dr. Qian Xuesen modestly stated that he had just returned to China, and there were many things to learn. He was willing to completely contribute the results of his twenty years of scientific research work, and to cultivate young scientific research talents for the motherland. He felt honored and proud to be able to serve the motherland. Now, he has accepted the invitation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and is preparing to preside over and lead the research work in mechanics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

    热爱祖国的科学家钱学森
    本报记者　柏生
    被美国政府非法软禁了五年，在祖国人民和政府的关怀和支持下，终于回到祖国怀抱的我国著名科学家钱学森博士，已经在十月二十八日来到了北京。
    钱学森博士是一九三四年在上海交通大学毕业后，一九三五年到美国去研究航空工程和空气动力学的。他曾先后在美国麻塞诸塞州理工学院、加利福尼亚州理工学院学习和研究，获得了博士学位，并历任这两个学校的教授和讲座。从一九四九年的下半年开始，他便担任加利福尼亚州理工学院的
  “古根罕喷气推进研究所”的负责人，领导研究生的研究和教学工作。在美国他曾发表了许多重要学术论文，如火箭及其他喷气推进的理论、弹性力学、可压缩气体的动力学、稀薄气体的动力学，以及燃烧问题和一般的自动控制理论等。这位今年仅四十三岁的科学家，已被公认为是力学界和应用数学界的权威学者之一。他的工作对工程科学起着积极的作用。
    钱学森博士是一位热爱祖国的科学家。五年前，他就怀着参加祖国建设事业的热烈愿望准备回国。但是当他还没有离开美国国境的时候，他就被美国政府非法扣留起来。在这整整五年的长时间里，他过着不自由和受折磨的非常痛苦的生活。直到今年八月四日，他才接到美国移民局的通知，说他被允许离开美国。九月十七日，他和他的妻子蒋英，带着他们的两个孩子，同二十几个中国留学生一起离开美国，乘“克利夫兰总统号”邮船经香港回到祖国。就在这次回国前，也还遭到了美国移民局和联邦调查局的无理搜查和监视。
    怀着激愤，钱学森博士向我们述说了他五年来由于要求回国所受到的美国政府的迫害。
    一九五○年八月，钱学森博士准备搭乘加拿大太平洋公司的飞机离开美国，他把他的许多科学书籍和自己在研究工作中做的笔记都装好箱，交由美国搬运公司启运回国。但是他突然接到了美国移民局的通知，说他被禁止出境；他的全部科学书籍和研究笔记都被美国联邦调查局的特务非法打开进行了检查，并全部被美国海关扣留。在这种无理的迫害下，他只好把飞机票退了。这年九月初，他又接到美国移民局的通知，说他是共产党，企图运输机密的科学文件回国，因此，要把他驱逐出境。这时他被非法逮捕送到移民局拘留所内。
    钱学森博士在美国移民局拘留所内被当作一个囚犯整整拘禁了十五天，受到了非法的审讯。最后因为他所在的加利福尼亚州理工学院的师生以及来自各方面的抗议，才被允许由这个学校出面交了一万五千元美金保释出来。
    钱学森博士痛苦地回忆说，那十五天的拘禁生活，使他的精神和身体都受到了无可补偿的损失。那时美国移民局的人员每天折磨着他，不许他和任何人谈话，每天晚上他们每隔十分钟要跑进拘留所看他一次，开一次电灯，看他在做些什么，使他无法休息。因为受到种种折磨，他的体重在这十五天内减轻了三十磅！
    他的全部科学书籍和研究笔记，被美国海关无理扣留了三年。最后被证明这些书籍和笔记完全是公开的，根本没有什么机密，可见移民局说他企图运输机密的科学文件完全是诬蔑和捏造。美国海关把他这些科学书籍还给他的时候，竟无耻地向他索取了三年的保管费用。
    钱学森博士从移民局拘留所被保释出来以后，事情并没有完，美国移民局还非法限制了他的自由，要他每月到移民局报到一次，并限制他不得离开他所在的洛杉矶县境。美国联邦调查局的特务还经常监视着他，时常进入他的研究室和住宅。他的信件和电话也都受到了检查。他的朋友，有的因为给他去了一次电话，便受到美国联邦调查局特务的盘问。在这整整五年内，他为了减少朋友们的麻烦，使自己经常处在和朋友隔绝的境地。但是他并没有屈服，他没有一天不在盼望着回到祖国的怀抱。为了回国的方便，他租住的房子都是只签订一年的合同。因此，他在五年中搬了许多次家。他的家庭里用的家具也都十分简陋。他的七岁的男孩和五岁的女孩，也都知道离美国远远的地方——中国，有他们的祖父和外祖母在想念着他们。在这五年中，由于对祖国的怀念，钱学森博士也曾怀着兴奋和激动的心情，读过一些关于祖国欣欣向荣，大规模开展建设事业的消息，他暗自计划着自己如何献身祖国的建设事业，决定在不能归国以前，更好地钻研一些专门的科学技术，扩大学问的基础，等到回国后能更好地贡献自己的力量。
    十月八日他到达广州以后，立刻受到祖国人民和祖国科学家的热烈欢迎。他踏上了祖国的土地，呼吸着祖国的空气，他是多么感到自由和愉快呵！这是他五年来无时无刻不在盼望的一天。在他踏在祖国温暖的土地上时，不禁想起许多和他一样在美国无辜受到迫害，至今还受着阻挠没能够顺利回到祖国的留学生的处境。
    他回到祖国以后，感到一切都是异常新鲜的，他在兴奋的心情中已经快度过了一个月。在广州他参观了毛主席在一九二六年曾经讲学过的地方——农民运动讲习所、苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会，这使他有了许多新的认识。他在美国的时候，除了能看到一些有关祖国建设的片断的消息外，是看不到祖国的更多的书报的。现在，他如饥似渴地读着反映祖国伟大建设的书籍。他回国后的短短的时间内，已经读完了有关五年计划和宪法等书籍，并且准备精读“毛泽东选集”。
    到上海后，他和分别多年的父亲、妹妹愉快地团聚了。从父亲、妹妹的谈话中，他也亲切地感到祖国各方面的变化。他的七十四岁的老父为了欢迎他，特地买了一套他喜爱的复制的“中国历代名画”送给他。十月十三日是他的七岁的儿子小永刚的生日，全家人都高兴地吃了面。他还去杭州家乡他的亡故的母亲的墓上扫了墓。
    在上海，他曾跑到他学习过的母校交通大学去参观，受到师生们的热烈欢迎。在杭州浙江大学参观的时候，他被学生们热情地包围起来，他看到新中国青年学生们充满着学习求知的热情，看到学生们美好的学习环境，这一切都使他非常感动。在上海和杭州的工厂参观的时候，他第一次看到祖国工人的幸福生活和高度的工作热情，看到了中国工人自己亲手制造的各种机器，这是他多少年来就梦想着实现的。
    钱学森博士在上海、北京看到了许多多年不见的老朋友，老同学，他发现他们都在朝气蓬勃地工作和学习。一九四七年暑假他曾回国住过三个月，那时正是国民党反动统治的黑暗时代，他看到曾和他一起在美国留学的植物学家殷宏章的苦闷情形。那时殷宏章连科学研究工作也无法进行。但是这次回国，他看到殷宏章在中国科学院植物生理研究所紧张地进行着科学研究工作，饱满的工作精神，使他异常感动。他参观了一些研究所，使他感到了中国共产党和人民政府对科学事业和科学家的关怀和重视。这些都是他过去所没有看到过的情景。当他看到中国的科学研究工作和其他各种事业一样在兴盛起来的时候，他很自然地连想起现在美国的科学研究工作也和美国其他各种事业一样，在走着没落道路。美国现在除了一些同战争有关的科学部门可以得到政府的支持和发展外，许多科学部门都得不到发展。一些正义的科学家由于不愿违背自己的良心把他们的研究成果用来残害人类，宁肯离开研究室去种花或修饰房屋，作为自己精神上的寄托。
    钱学森博士看到祖国的各种新气象，对比着他在美国所看到的那些事实，格外使他感到祖国有无限美好的前途。在他到北京的第二天清早，他就带着妻子和两个孩子去观看他们曾经在美国日夜想念过的那个伟大的地方，——中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席曾经在那里宣布中华人民共和国诞生的巍峨的天安门。站在天安门的广场上，他越发感到祖国的伟大和可爱。
    钱学森博士谦虚地表示，自己刚刚回国，许多东西都还要学习，他愿意把自己二十年来从事科学研究工作的成果完全贡献出来，并为祖国培养年青的科学研究人材。能为祖国服务他感到光荣和骄傲。现在他已经接受了中国科学院的聘请，准备主持和领导中国科学院力学方面的研究工作。
