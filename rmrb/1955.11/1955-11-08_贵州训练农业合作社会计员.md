Guizhou Province has trained more than 20,000 agricultural production cooperative accountants in two batches, one-quarter of whom are ethnic minorities. The trainees are mostly junior and senior primary school graduates and young activists from mutual aid groups. After training and mutual learning, they have improved their professional skills, and most of them have taken on the accounting work in the cooperatives. In order to meet the needs of the development of agricultural production cooperatives, the province plans to train 27,000 accountants by the end of the year.

    贵州训练农业合作社会计员
    贵州省先后两批已训练了二万多名农业生产合作社会计人员，其中少数民族占四分之一。受训的成员大都是初小、高小毕业生和互助组的青年积极分子。经过训练和互教互学以后，他们都提高了业务能力，大部分已担负起社里会计工作。为适应农业生产合作社发展的需要，全省计划到年底要训练到二万七千名会计人员。
