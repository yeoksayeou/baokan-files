Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 3rd (TASS): The Prime Minister of the Union of Burma, U Nu, held a press conference in Moscow on November 3rd. More than one hundred Soviet and foreign journalists attended the press conference. Prime Minister U Nu answered many questions posed to him at the conference.

Speaking about his impressions of his visit to the Soviet Union, U Nu said: We visited several republics of the Soviet Union and were warmly received everywhere. In some places, people welcomed us not only as friends, but as their own relatives.

U Nu then said: The economic achievements of the Soviet Union, especially the measures in agriculture, have left a deep impression on me. Many of the things I saw in agriculture will be of great benefit to Burma.

I was also amazed by the very high level of cultural development achieved in the Soviet Union. I was very pleased to see the performances of the Soviet ballet, opera, and singing groups. The Soviet government has shown great concern for improving the conditions of the working people.

In his speech, Prime Minister U Nu specifically pointed out that in the Soviet Union, women enjoy full equal rights and freedoms, including women in the union republics inhabited by people who believe in Islam. He also said that he personally saw that Buddhists in the Soviet Union enjoy the freedom to practice their religion and perform religious ceremonies.

In response to questions from reporters, Prime Minister U Nu expressed satisfaction with the agreements between Burma and the Soviet Union on trade and technical assistance to Burma. U Nu emphasized that the Soviet Union was the first country to agree to provide technical assistance to Burma on the terms proposed by Burma.

The Burmese Prime Minister also answered many questions about Burma's position on international issues. When asked how he thought the easing of tensions in Asia and the Far East could be better promoted, U Nu said that mutual visits and expanded contacts between countries could bring great benefits. He said: I have always believed that establishing contact between people is the best way to consolidate peace. U Nu cited the Bandung Conference as an example. He pointed out that Burma established friendly relations with more countries at this conference.

Speaking about Burma's foreign policy, U Nu said that Burma believes that the best way to maintain peace and ensure security is not to participate in any bloc. U Nu said: As a country not bound by any obligations to any bloc, Burma can maintain friendly relations with all countries. He said: Even in the future, we will refuse to join any bloc.

    新华社四日讯　塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：缅甸联邦总理吴努十一月三日在莫斯科举行了记者招待会。出席招待会的有一百多名苏联和外国的新闻记者。吴努总理在招待会上回答了向他提出的许多问题。
    吴努在谈到自己访问苏联的观感时，说：我们访问了苏联的几个共和国，到处都受到殷勤的接待。在某些地方，人们不仅当作朋友来欢迎我们，而且当作自己的亲人来欢迎我们。
    吴努接着说：苏联在经济方面获得的成就，特别是在农业方面的措施，给我留下了很深的印象。我看到的农业方面的许多东西，将会带给缅甸很大的好处。
    苏联在文化发展上所达到的非常高度的水平也使我感到惊奇。我非常满意地观看了苏联的巴蕾舞、歌剧和歌唱团的演出。苏联政府对于改善劳动群众的境况表现出极大的关怀。
    吴努总理在讲话中特别指出，在苏联，妇女享有充分的平等权利和自由，其中包括那些住有信仰伊斯兰教的居民的加盟共和国中的妇女。他还说，他亲眼看到，苏联的佛教徒享有信教和举行宗教仪式的自由。
    吴努总理在回答记者们提出的问题时，对缅甸同苏联之间关于贸易和给缅甸以技术援助的协定表示满意。吴努强调说，苏联是第一个同意根据缅甸提出的条件给予缅甸以技术援助的国家。
    缅甸总理还回答了许多有关缅甸在国际问题上的立场的问题。吴努在谈到他认为怎样才更能促进亚洲和远东紧张局势的缓和这个问题的时候说，互相访问和扩大各国之间的接触可以带来很大的好处。他说：我一直认为，建立人们之间的接触，是巩固和平的最好的方式。吴努举出万隆会议作为例子。他指出，缅甸在这次会议上同更多的国家建立了友好关系。
    吴努在谈到缅甸的对外政策的时候说，缅甸认为，维护和平和保障安全的最好方法是不参加任何集团。吴努说：作为一个不受任何集团的任何义务约束的国家，缅甸可以同所有国家保持友好关系。他说：就是以后，我们也拒绝参加任何集团。
