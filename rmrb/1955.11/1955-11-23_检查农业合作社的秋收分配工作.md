    Inspecting the Autumn Harvest Distribution Work of Agricultural Cooperatives
  　Zhong Qiu
    The Qingshui District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's Yingshan County, Sichuan Province, recently inspected the autumn harvest distribution situation of agricultural cooperatives throughout the district. It was found that the cooperatives had generally increased production, but the income of a considerable number of members was less than last year. Some members reduced their income because of weak labor, or lack of enthusiasm for labor, or improper allocation of labor within the cooperative; however, the majority reduced their income because the distribution work was not done well. The reason why the distribution work is not done well is often because the accounting work is weak, and labor work points are missed or miscalculated. After this inspection in Qingshui District, each cooperative recalculated the labor accounts of its members and the income accounts before and after joining the cooperative, and tried its best to arrange work for members with less income. As a result, the distribution became more reasonable, and the mood of the members changed from turbulence to stability.
    According to the existing materials, the phenomenon of neglecting autumn harvest distribution and rough distribution is quite common nationwide. There are many reasons for this phenomenon: the accounting work of some cooperatives is very chaotic, and the accounts are recorded incorrectly or missed; the land assessment of some cooperatives is unreasonable, and the distribution ratio is inappropriate; some cooperatives simply distribute on a per capita basis based on land or population; some cooperatives with good harvests want to distribute all the income, leaving little or no public accumulation fund, public welfare fund, and production investment; some cooperatives, regardless of the actual income of the members, deduct too much public accumulation fund and production funds, and even withhold so-called "contingency grain" and "reserve fund"; some cooperatives have serious corruption, theft, and waste after the autumn harvest. The vast majority of members are extremely dissatisfied with these phenomena. In order to consolidate old cooperatives and develop new cooperatives, this problem must be solved.
    Some people say: Cooperatives distribute every year, and these are the same problems every year, what's so strange about it? However, it is precisely these problems that relate to the vital interests of the members, and the progress and retreat of the cooperative and its impact on farmers outside the cooperative. Therefore, anyone who cares about the lives of the members and the development of the cooperative has no reason to relax their concern and leadership over the distribution work. The current situation fully shows that the autumn harvest distribution work is obviously being neglected by some rural workers. They are busy with "movements" and "high tides" all day long, and do not pay attention to the distribution of old cooperatives; some people are satisfied with the bumper harvest and do not take the distribution seriously. Some people even put forward such a reason: "The meat rots in the pot, is there any worry about distributing grain?" Under the control of these ideas, they do not specifically lead the income distribution of the cooperative, or simply and hastily carry out the distribution. In this way, all kinds of problems naturally arise.
    Fuyang and other counties in Zhejiang have this experience: Where attention is paid to income distribution at the same time, the high tide is more likely to form. Gao Fan Village announced the autumn harvest distribution plan. The peasants saw with their own eyes that the income of the members had generally increased. The enthusiasm for joining the cooperative was high, and the number of farmers who signed up suddenly increased. Those who only care about the "high tide" and do not care about the distribution, only care about developing new cooperatives and do not care about consolidating old cooperatives, should learn a lesson from this.
    All localities should learn from the practice of Qingshui District in Yingshan, conduct an inspection of the income distribution of cooperatives in their own regions, correct deviations, and solve problems. Areas that have completed or are in the process of autumn harvest distribution need to check the implementation of the distribution policy; areas that have not yet started distribution should strengthen the leadership of the distribution work and strive to finalize the accounts as soon as possible. We must never repeat the lessons of some cooperatives last year and delay the distribution accounts until the spring of next year.

    检查农业合作社的秋收分配工作
  　仲秋
    中共四川省营山县清水区委员会最近检查全区农业合作社秋收分配的情况，发现合作社普遍增产了，但是有相当一部分社员的收入比去年少。有些社员减少了收入，是因为劳动力弱，或者劳动不积极，或者社内劳力调配不当；而多数人所以减少了收入，是因为分配工作没有做好。分配工作所以做不好，常常是因为会计工作薄弱，把劳动工账记漏了，算错了。清水区经过这次检查，各社重新计算社员的劳动账目和入社前后的收入账目，尽可能给收入少的社员安排活路。结果，分配合理了，社员的情绪由动荡变为稳定。
    根据现有的材料看来，不重视秋收分配和分配粗糙的现象，在全国范围内是相当普遍的。造成这种现象的原因相当多：有些社的会计工作很混乱，账目记错记漏了；有些社的土地评产不合理，分配比例不恰当；有些社简单地按土地或人口平均分配；有些丰收的社要把全部收入都分光，不留或只留极少的公积金、公益金和生产投资；有些社不顾社员实际收入，过多地扣除公积金和生产资金，甚至还要扣留所谓“机动粮”、
  “预备金”；有些社在秋收以后发生了严重的贪污、偷盗、浪费现象。广大社员对这些现象极不满意，为了巩固老社发展新社，这个问题必须解决。
    有些人说：合作社年年分配，年年都是这些问题，有什么奇怪的呢？但是，正是这些问题，关系社员的切身利益，关系合作社的进退和对社外农民的影响。因此，凡是关心社员的生活和合作社的发展的人，没有任何理由放松对分配工作的关心和领导。目前的情况充分说明，秋收分配工作显然被一些农村工作人员所忽略了。他们终日忙于“运动”和“高潮”，对老社的分配不加过问；有些人则满足于丰收，就不把分配当回事了。有的人还提出这样的理由：“肉烂在锅里，有粮还愁分？”在这些思想支配下，他们就不去具体领导合作社的收益分配，或是简单草率地进行分配，这样一来，各种各样的问题自然就发生了。
    浙江富阳等县有这样的经验：哪里同时注意收益分配工作，哪里高潮就更容易形成。高畈村公布了秋收分配方案，农民亲眼看到社员收入普遍增加，入社热情高涨，报名的农户突然增多。那些只顾“高潮”、不管分配，只顾发展新社、不顾巩固老社的人，应该从这里得到教训。
    各地应该学习营山清水区的作法，把自己地区合作社的收益分配情况进行一次检查，纠正偏差，解决问题。已经完成和正在进行秋收分配的地区，需要检查分配政策贯彻执行的情况；还没有动手分配的地区，更要加强分配工作的领导，争取早日决算结账。我们决不要重复某些合作社在去年的教训，把分配老账一直拖延到来年春天。
