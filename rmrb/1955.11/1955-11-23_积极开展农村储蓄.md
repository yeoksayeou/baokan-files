Actively Develop Rural Savings
　　Yang Fangxun

　　This year, the quantity of agricultural products entering the market during the peak season is large, and the timing is also concentrated. In order to purchase these agricultural products, the state must inject a large amount of currency, which has led to an excessive concentration of currency injection in many regions, especially in technical crop areas. If the currency withdrawal work is not done well, it is likely to cause a monetary shock to the market in these areas, leading to price fluctuations. At the same time, after farmers sell a large number of agricultural products, in addition to using some of the money to purchase necessary means of production and living, they need to save a portion of the money to be used as production funds for the coming year. Therefore, rural financial institutions in various regions must actively develop rural savings business, absorb farmers' deposits, and avoid monetary shocks to the market.

　　This year, the State Bank has decided to discontinue the "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings," and general savings business will be handled by credit cooperatives in various regions. In the past two years, because credit cooperatives had not yet been universally established, the state, in order to adjust the seasonal differences between concentrated currency injection and commodity supply and ensure market stability, stipulated more favorable interest rates to encourage farmers to actively save and organize currency withdrawal, which was entirely necessary and correct. However, the current situation has undergone significant changes. The vast number of farmers have gained a certain understanding of savings. At the same time, more than 80% of the country's townships have credit cooperatives, which have become a huge force in organizing and adjusting rural funds. In the first half of this year, the total amount of deposits absorbed by credit cooperatives across the country reached more than 700 million yuan, and the total amount of loans issued reached more than 497 million yuan. Under such circumstances, the State Bank's discontinuation of "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" and the transfer of general savings to credit cooperatives for handling is a very necessary and timely measure.

　　Some rural financial workers are worried that discontinuing preferential savings will affect farmers' interest in savings. This concern is unnecessary. It should be recognized that although preferential savings have a certain encouraging effect on farmers, farmers' savings are mainly based on increased income, and their purpose in participating in savings is to accumulate funds for expanding reproduction next year. Therefore, as long as farmers are given enhanced publicity and education, and the benefits of savings are explained to them, they will actively participate in savings. The large amount of deposits absorbed by the Kengxia Township Credit Cooperative in Chun'an County, Zhejiang Province, is a good example. Kengxia Township had a bumper harvest of soybeans this year, with an estimated output of about 210,000 jin. Initially, farmers were afraid that commodity fertilizers would be in short supply and planned to keep more soybeans for processing into fertilizer. The credit cooperative, in coordination with the township's Party and government departments, conducted in-depth publicity among farmers. On the one hand, farmers were educated to respond to the government's call to sell soybeans to the state to support industrial construction, and on the other hand, farmers were mobilized to accumulate more natural fertilizers to solve the problem of insufficient fertilizer. After the problem of fertilizer shortage was solved, the farmers actively sold soybeans and deposited the surplus money into the credit cooperative. From August 1st to 15th, the entire township sold 121,300 jin of soybeans; after selling the soybeans, the farmers actively deposited the money into the credit cooperative. According to statistics, the deposits absorbed by the credit cooperative this time accounted for 61.5% of the total amount of currency injected by the state for the purchase of soybeans. Of course, some farmers also have many concerns about participating in savings. Such as fear of showing off wealth, fear of being borrowed from, and fear of agricultural cooperatives forcing investment, etc., and therefore prefer to keep the remaining money in their own hands rather than participate in savings. This requires individual publicity and mobilization. Some places have adopted the method of "one key opens one lock," which has been very effective by conducting connections through confidants.

　　Absorbing farmers' savings must be based on farmers' voluntary participation, which is a principle that absolutely cannot be violated. Last year, some regions adopted methods such as deductions and other compulsory savings methods in savings work, which aroused widespread dissatisfaction among farmers. For example, some farmers in Jinnan Prefecture, Shanxi Province, went to supply and marketing cooperatives to sell cotton, which was paid for by the credit cooperative on their behalf. When the credit cooperative made the payment, it deducted the savings deposits reported by the farmers at the meeting. The local farmers were afraid of the credit cooperative's deductions and were unwilling to sell cotton anymore. The above errors must not be repeated this year.

　　Some bank workers believe that after the savings business is transferred to the credit cooperatives, the bank can ignore it. This view is wrong. After the bank transfers the savings business to the credit cooperatives for handling, it should strengthen leadership even more. It must be understood that although there are many credit cooperatives at present, most of them are newly established and are not yet familiar with the business, and problems may occur in terms of procedures and systems. Therefore, bank institutions in various regions must strengthen specific assistance to credit cooperatives; guide credit cooperatives to do a good job in accounting and prevent confusion; at the same time, they must urge credit cooperatives to transfer funds to the bank for deposit to prevent improper use of funds by credit cooperatives, which may lead to difficulties in paying deposits next year. In addition, in areas where credit cooperatives have not yet been established, the bank should also take on the savings business.

### 积极开展农村储蓄

　　积极开展农村储蓄
　　杨方勋
    今年旺季农产品上市数量多，时间也很集中。为了收购这些农产品，国家要投放大量货币，这就在不少地区特别是技术作物区发生了货币投放过分集中的现象。如果货币回笼工作做得不好，在这些地区就很可能造成货币对市场的冲击，引起物价波动。同时，农民在出售大量农产品以后，除了用一部分钱购买必需的生产资料和生活资料外，他们需要储蓄一部分钱，留作明年的生产资金。因此，各地农村金融机构必须积极地开展农村储蓄业务，吸收农民的存款，避免货币对市场的冲击。
    今年国家银行已经决定停办“粮棉优待储蓄”，一般储蓄业务转由各地信用合作社办理。过去两年由于信用合作社尚未普遍建立，国家为了调剂季节性的货币集中投放和商品供应之间的差额，保证市场稳定，规定较优厚的利息以鼓励农民踊跃储蓄，组织货币回笼，是完全必要和正确的。但是目前情况已经发生了很大的变化。广大农民对储蓄已经有了一定的认识。同时全国百分之八十以上的乡都有了信用合作社，已经成为一支组织和调剂农村资金的巨大力量。今年上半年全国信用合作社吸收存款总额达七亿多万元，放款总额达四亿九千七百多万元。在这种情况下，国家银行停办“粮棉优待储蓄”，一般储蓄转由信用社办理就是一种十分必要的和适时的措施。
    有些农村金融工作人员担心停办优待储蓄后，会影响农民对储蓄的兴趣。这种顾虑是不必要的。应该认识：优待储蓄对农民虽然有一定的鼓励作用，但是农民的储蓄主要是建立在收入增加的基础上，他们参加储蓄的目的是为了积累明年扩大再生产的资金，因此，只要向农民加强宣传教育，讲清楚储蓄对他们的好处，他们是会积极参加储蓄的。浙江省淳安县坑下乡信用合作社大量吸收存款就是一个很好的例子。坑下乡今年黄豆丰收，估计产量约二十一万斤左右。农民起初害怕商品肥料供不应求，打算多留黄豆加工作肥料。信用合作社配合乡的党、政部门向农民进行了深入的宣传。一方面教育农民响应政府号召，把黄豆卖给国家，支援工业建设，另方面动员农民多积自然肥料来解决肥料不足的问题。缺肥的问题解决以后，农民便积极出卖黄豆，把多余的钱存入信用合作社。从八月一日至十五日，全乡出售黄豆十二万一千三百斤；农民在卖了黄豆以后，都踊跃地把钱存入信用合作社。据统计，信用社这次吸收的存款占国家收购黄豆投放货币总数的百分之六十一点五。当然，有一些农民对参加储蓄也有不少顾虑。如怕露富、怕别人借、怕农业合作社强迫投资等，因而宁肯把余下来的钱放在自己手里而不愿参加储蓄。这就需要个别进行宣传、动员。有些地方采取了“一把钥匙开一把锁”的方法，通过知心知己的人进行串连，很有成效。
    吸收农民储蓄，必须根据农民自愿，这是一条绝对不能违犯的原则。去年有些地区在储蓄工作中采取扣款等强迫储蓄的办法，引起农民普遍不满。例如山西省晋南专区有些农民到供销社卖棉花，由信用社代付款。信用社付款的时候，就扣除农民在会议上报的储蓄存款。当地农民害怕信用社扣款，就不愿再卖棉花了。上述错误，今年决不容许重复。
    有些银行工作人员认为储蓄业务转给信用社以后，银行就可以不管了。这种看法是错误的。银行在把储蓄业务转给信用社办理以后更应该加强领导。必须了解，当前信用社的数量虽然很多，但是大部分是新建立的，对业务还不熟悉，在手续制度方面都可能发生问题。因此，各地银行机构要加强对信用社的具体帮助；指导信用社搞好账务，防止错乱现象发生；同时要督促信用社把资金转存银行，防止信用社对资金运用不当，明年发生支付存款的困难。此外，在部分还没有建立信用社的地区，银行还应该把储蓄业务担负起来。
