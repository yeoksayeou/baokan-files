The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Committee Commercial Department recently adjusted the prices of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral products throughout Xinjiang, including lowering the purchasing prices of seven kinds of agricultural and pastoral products, the retail prices of four major non-staple foods, the sales prices of ten categories of industrial products belonging to means of production, the prices of more than a dozen categories of industrial products belonging to consumer goods, and the prices of eighteen kinds of major medicinal materials.

In the years since liberation, with the continuous development of production and the fundamental improvement of the national finances, market prices in Xinjiang have become increasingly stable and reasonable. However, the overall price level in Xinjiang is still relatively high nationwide, which affects the overall development of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, increases national financial expenditures, and affects the normal purchasing of agricultural and pastoral products and the supply of certain products. It is also not in line with the new situation that major changes will occur in Xinjiang's prices after the completion of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. In order to make the prices of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral products in Xinjiang more reasonable, gradually adapt them to the national price level, further consolidate price stability, improve the lives of all ethnic groups, and promote the overall development of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, the Xinjiang Commercial Department has comprehensively adjusted prices in a timely manner, which has been supported by people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang.

    新疆商业厅调整市场物价降低多种工农牧业商品价格
    新疆维吾尔自治区人民委员会商业厅最近调整了全新疆工、农、牧业商品的价格，计降低了七种农牧业产品收购价格、四种主要副食品的零售价格、十类属于生产资料的工业品的销售价格，十几类属于消费资料的工业品价格和十八种主要药材的价格。
    解放后几年来，新疆市场物价，随着生产的不断发展和国家财政的根本好转，日益走向稳定和合理。但是，新疆地区的物价总水平，在全国范围内还是偏高的，这就影响到工农牧业生产的全面发展，增加了国家的财政支出，影响到农牧业产品的正常收购和某些产品的供应，尤其是和将来兰新铁路修通以后新疆物价将发生重大变化的新情况不相适应。为了使新疆工、农、牧业产品的价格更趋合理，逐步同全国物价水平相适应，以进一步巩固物价稳定，改善各族人民生活，促使工、农、牧业生产全面发展，新疆商业厅适时地全面调整了物价，受到新疆各族人民的拥护。
