    Promoting Broad Contacts Between East and West

    Expanding and developing economic and cultural exchanges between East and West has become an important issue in the current international situation. The discussions on this issue at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Geneva have received widespread attention and importance from people and public opinion in various countries. People expect the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to make useful contributions in this regard to promote international cooperation and better mutual understanding.

    The Soviet delegation put forward a proposal on developing contacts between East and West at the meeting on October 31, which is in line with the spirit of the instructions given by the heads of government of the four countries to their foreign ministers. The instructions of the heads of government of the four countries stipulate that the measures for developing East-West contacts should be able to (a) promote the gradual elimination of obstacles hindering free movement and peaceful trade between the peoples of various countries; (b) promote freer contact and exchange that is mutually beneficial to the countries and peoples concerned. The Soviet proposal contains various measures sufficient to achieve these two requirements, and acting in accordance with this proposal can promote the broad development of contacts between East and West.

    The three Western countries also submitted a memorandum on a proposal for developing East-West contacts. Although this proposal also emphasizes the importance of developing East-West contacts, the proposal itself has not fully reflected the desire to broadly develop East-West contacts. First, the proposal of the three Western countries does not mention the issue of eliminating existing obstacles and restrictions in East-West international trade. Second, the above-mentioned proposal limits the issue of East-West contact to the scope of Western countries with the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries. The U.S. government has openly stated that the measures they will take exclude the People's Republic of China and some other people's democratic countries. May I ask, how can broad contact between East and West be truly achieved within such a narrow scope!

    It is known that the abnormal state of economic and cultural exchanges between Eastern and Western countries and people's exchanges is a product of the "Cold War." Due to this situation, the traditional economic and trade ties between many countries have been artificially restricted, and serious difficulties have arisen in maintaining and developing international contact and cooperation in science and culture. At the same time, objective and correct information often cannot be conveyed and is replaced by ulterior motives. This situation has not only caused adverse effects in the relationship between Western countries and the Soviet Union and European people's democratic countries, but also damaged the relations and exchanges between other countries, especially hindering the establishment of universal mutual trust between countries. Therefore, in order to develop contacts between East and West, it is necessary to comprehensively eliminate the impact of the "Cold War" and promote universal international cooperation and trust in order to further ease international tensions. Imposing many reservations and regional restrictions on the issue of developing East-West contacts can only show an attempt to continue implementing the "Cold War" policy in disguise. This approach is not in line with the requirements of truly strengthening international cooperation and trust.

    The obstacles hindering the smooth development of East-West contacts are primarily the trade discrimination policies implemented by some countries against the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and people's democratic countries. Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his speech at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference on October 31: "Various prohibitions and restrictions in trade cause distrust in international relations and damage traditional economic ties, which not only hinders the strengthening of international economic relations, but also hinders the strengthening of other international relations." In this regard, it should be particularly pointed out that the so-called "blockade" and "embargo" imposed by the United States and its followers on the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and people's democratic countries are unacceptable. At the same time, obstructing the freedom of navigation of merchant ships, especially the interception of merchant ships coming to China, seriously hinders the development of normal international trade.

    The "blockade" and "embargo" policy against socialist camp countries has long been unpopular. In the current situation where international tensions have eased to a certain extent, this policy has especially been criticized and condemned by fair public opinion in various countries. Broad international public opinion, including the public opinion of the United States, Britain, and France, has advocated eliminating obstacles to East-West trade in order to expand East-West trade. Many countries and business people who have been harmed by the "embargo" policy urgently demand the restoration and development of normal international trade. Even U.S. Senator George W. Malone, who once participated in drafting the "embargo" list, also believed in a conversation with reporters on August 29 this year that the U.S. "embargo" policy was "a little out of whack." Canceling the "blockade" and "embargo" has become a common demand of the public in various countries.

    In his speech discussing the issue of developing contacts between East and West, Foreign Minister Molotov emphasized that the committee of experts should first study the issue of eliminating the existing discriminatory measures that hinder the development of economic relations between countries. This proposition is entirely realistic and in line with the common aspirations of the people of all countries. The Chinese side has already raised the issue of lifting the embargo against China in the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks. It is obvious that only by eliminating existing trade barriers and promoting the normal development of international trade can a realistic foundation be laid for realizing and broadly developing contact and friendly exchanges between the people of all countries.

    On the issue of promoting East-West contact, it is beneficial to further develop cultural, scientific, and technological contacts, as well as exchanging industrial and agricultural experiences, sending more delegations of social figures and cultural figures to visit each other, and developing travel exchanges. Since the Geneva Four Heads of Government Conference, various countries have done some work in this regard. Cultural ties between countries have expanded, especially the number of social figures and delegations from various countries visiting the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and people's democratic countries has increased. At the same time, the number of delegations from the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and people's democratic countries visiting other countries has also greatly increased. This plays a significant role in enhancing mutual understanding and trust between the people of various countries. However, due to the restrictive policies adopted by some other countries, this achievement is limited. In order to broadly develop exchanges between the people of various countries and strengthen mutual ties, greater efforts must be made.

    The desire to develop contacts between East and West embodies the growth of the idea of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social and political systems. Therefore, whether it is promoting economic and cultural exchanges, or free contact and exchanges between people, it must be carried out on the basis of equality and mutual respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. Moreover, only on the basis of these principles can positive results be obtained and mutual respect and trust strengthened. However, not everyone is willing to act in accordance with the above-mentioned principles. Some people in Western countries make no secret of their attempt to use the expansion of East-West contact as a tool for them to carry out a certain expansion into socialist and people's democratic countries, leading to the "peaceful transformation" of the social systems of these countries that they fantasize about. This delusion must be abandoned, otherwise it can only be spurned by peace-loving people of all countries and seriously endanger the cause of international cooperation.

    The foreign ministers of the four countries have expressed in their speeches their willingness to seek positive results on the issue of developing East-West contacts, and this desire is welcome. The strengthening of contacts between East and West will undoubtedly bring about a further easing of the international situation and promote the settlement of other international issues, which is in line with the common aspirations of the peace-loving people of all countries.

    The Chinese people have always supported the broad development of East-West contacts and supported the cause of strengthening international cooperation. Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the Soviet proposal on developing East-West contacts and hope that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will achieve positive results in this regard.

### 促进东西方之间的广泛接触

    促进东西方之间的广泛接触
    扩大和发展东西方的经济和文化交流，已成为当前国际局势中的一个重要的课题。在日内瓦举行的四国外长会议关于这个问题的讨论，受到了各国人民和公众舆论的广泛注意和重视。人们期望，四国外长会议能在这方面作出有益的贡献，以促进国际合作和更好的相互谅解。
    苏联代表团在十月三十一日的会议上提出了关于发展东西方之间的接触的建议，这个建议是符合于四国政府首脑给外交部长们的指示的精神的。四国政府首脑的指示中规定关于发展东西方接触的措施应当能够（甲）促成逐步消除妨碍各国人民之间的自由往来和和平贸易的障碍；（乙）促成对有关国家和人民相互有利的更自由的接触和交流。苏联的建议包含了足以实现这两方面要求的各种措施，按照这个建议行事就能够促进东西方之间的接触的广泛发展。
    西方三国也提出了一个关于发展东西方接触的建议的备忘录。在这个建议中，虽然也强调发展东西方之间接触的重要性，但是这个建议的本身却并没有能够充分地反映出广泛发展东西方接触的愿望。首先，西方三国的建议中，没有提到消除东西方国际贸易中现存的障碍和限制的问题。其次，上述的建议把东西方接触的问题只限制在西方国家同苏联和一部分东欧国家的范围内。美国政府公开表示他们所将采取的措施是把中华人民共和国和其他一些人民民主国家排除在外的。试问在这样狭窄的范围内，怎么能够真正实现东西方之间的广泛接触呢！
    人们知道，东西方国家经济和文化交流以及人民之间往来的不正常状况，是“冷战”的产物。由于这种状况，许多国家之间的传统的经济和贸易的联系受到了人为的限制，在保持和发展科学和文化的国际接触和合作方面也发生了严重的困难，同时客观的正确的消息往往不能传达而被别有用心的消息所代替。这种情况不仅在西方国家和苏联以及欧洲人民民主国家的关系中引起了不良的影响，并且也损害着其他国家之间的关系和往来，特别是妨碍普遍的国与国之间的相互信任的建立。因此，为了发展东西方之间的接触，必须全面地消除“冷战”的影响，促进普遍的国际合作和信任，以进一步缓和国际紧张局势。在发展东西方接触的问题上加以许多保留和地区范围的限制，这只能表明企图变相地继续执行“冷战”政策。这种做法和真正加强国际间的合作和信任的要求是不相符合的。
    阻碍着东西方接触的顺利发展的障碍，首先是一些国家对苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家所执行的贸易歧视政策。莫洛托夫外长十月三十一日在四国外长会议上的发言中指出：“在贸易方面的种种禁止和限制引起国际关系中的不信任，损害了传统的经济联系，这不仅阻碍着国际经济关系的加强，而且还阻碍着国际其他关系的加强。”在这方面，特别应该指出美国及其追随者对苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家施行的所谓“封锁”“禁运”，是不能容许的。同时，阻碍商船航行自由，特别是拦劫开来中国的商船的事情，也严重地妨害着国际正常贸易的发展。
    对社会主义阵营国家实行的“封锁”“禁运”政策早已不得人心了。在目前国际局势已经有一定程度的缓和的情况下，这种政策尤其遭到了各国公正舆论的非议和指责。广泛的国际舆论，包括美、英、法三国的舆论，纷纷主张消除阻碍东西方贸易的障碍，以扩大东西方的贸易。许多受到“禁运”政策损害的国家和企业界人士，迫切地要求恢复和发展国际正常贸易。甚至曾经参加拟订“禁运”货单的美国参议员乔治·吴·马隆，在今年八月二十九日对记者的谈话中，也认为美国的“禁运”政策“有点不大对头”。取消“封锁”“禁运”已经成为各国公众的普遍要求了。
    莫洛托夫外长在讨论关于发展东西方之间的接触问题的发言中，强调指出专家委员会应该首先研究消除现有的那些阻碍着各国间经济关系发展的歧视措施的问题，这个主张完全是实事求是的，而且也是符合于各国人民的共同愿望的。中国方面已经在中美大使级会谈中提出解除对中国的禁运的问题。很显然，只有消除现存的贸易障碍，促进国际贸易的正常发展，才能为实现和广泛发展各国人民之间的接触和友好往来打下现实的基础。
    在促进东西方接触的问题上，进一步发展文化、科学、技术各方面的接触，以及交换工业和农业的经验，更多地互派社会人士和文化人士的代表团访问，发展旅行往来，都是有好处的。自从日内瓦四国政府首脑会议以来，各国在这方面都做了一些工作。各国之间的文化联系扩大了，特别是到苏联、中华人民共和国以及人民民主国家访问的各国社会人士和代表团增加了，同时苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家到其他国家访问的代表团也大大增加了。这对于增进各国人民之间的相互了解和信任是有很大的作用的。但是，由于其他一些国家采取了限制政策，这种成就是有限的，为了广泛地发展各国人民之间的交往并加强相互之间的联系，还必须作更大的努力。
    发展东西方之间的接触的愿望，体现了不同社会和政治制度国家之间和平共处的思想的增长。因此，无论是促进经济和文化的交流，或者是人民之间的自由接触和交往，都必须在平等和互相尊重主权以及互不干涉内政的基础上进行。并且，也只有在这些原则的基础上才能求得积极的结果，加强相互之间的尊重和信任。但是，并不是所有的人都愿意按照上述的这些原则行事的。西方国家的某些人士毫不隐讳地企图把扩大东西方的接触作为他们向社会主义和人民民主国家进行某种扩张的工具，以导致他们所幻想的这些国家的社会制度的“和平转变”。这种妄想是必须抛弃的，否则它只能遭到各国爱好和平人民的唾弃，并严重地危害国际合作的事业。
    四国外长在他们的发言中，都表示愿意在发展东西方接触的问题上求得积极的结果，这种愿望是值得欢迎的。东西方之间接触的加强无疑将带来国际局势的进一步缓和，并促成其他国际问题的解决，这是符合于各国爱好和平人民的共同愿望的。
    中国人民一贯拥护广泛发展东西方之间的接触，支持加强国际合作的事业。因此，我们衷心拥护苏联关于发展东西方之间的接触的建议，并希望四国外长会议在这方面取得积极的成就。
