　　阿富汗部落领袖大会通过决议
    新华社二十四日讯　据塔斯社喀布尔消息：在喀布尔举行的阿富汗部落领袖大会已经在二十日结束。这个大会由国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿主持开幕，有三百名部落民族领袖参加。
    部落领袖大会一致就巴克同尼斯坦问题通过决议。这个决议是：一、大会建议政府根据宗教法典的条款，支持巴克同尼斯坦人民的要求，保障他们有独立决定自己命运的权利。二、大会考虑到巴基斯坦政府现在奉行的政策，特别是它接受大国的军事援助而建立的力量以及巴基斯坦采取的损害阿富汗的危险措施，建议政府用各种可能的方法和公认的正直方式，为了国防的目的而加强和武装国家。三、大会声明，如果不得巴克同尼斯坦人民的同意和愿意，大会无论如何不承认巴克同尼斯坦地区是巴基斯坦领土的一部分。大会确认阿富汗国民议会和参议院在十一月十七日就这一问题作出的决定。
