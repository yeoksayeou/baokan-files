Shanxi, Jiangxi, Shandong and other provinces tap into agricultural production potential
Strive to complete the 1957 production increase targets next year
    This newspaper reports: Shanxi, Jiangxi, Shandong and other provinces have decided to call on and organize farmers to adopt various measures in light of local conditions to tap into production increase potential, and strive to complete or exceed the agricultural production increase targets for 1957 in 1956.
    Based on the needs of national industrialization, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China studied the new situation brought about by agricultural cooperativization in the province, believing that there is still great potential for production increase in agricultural production. It decided to take specific measures to strive to complete the 1957 production increase targets in 1956. The province originally planned to reach a total grain output of 8.96 billion catties in 1957, an increase of 16 percent over 1952; and a total cotton output of 26.6 million catties, an increase of 44 percent. The specific measures that the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China plans to take, in addition to continuing to deeply publicize the significance of completing the Five-Year Plan, improve the production enthusiasm of the masses, vigorously rectify and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, and give play to their production advantages, also actively strengthen production preparation work this winter. Next year, the province's paddy fields can be increased from the current 7.3 million mu to 8.5 million mu, and currently 100,000 farmers in the province have invested in winter water conservancy construction. In terms of fertilizer, a mass manure collection campaign of "thousand carts, ten thousand loads" has been launched among the vast number of young people in the province. It is also planned to establish a one-million-mu cotton production increase demonstration area in the province next year, with a yield of 77 catties of ginned cotton per mu. It is planned to expand the planting area of ​​corn and potatoes in Yanbei area of ​​northwestern Shanxi. In addition, it is also necessary to vigorously prevent and control pests such as aphids, pink bollworms, and corn borers, among which corn borer damage will be reduced by half next year compared to this year.
    The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided at a recent enlarged meeting to call on party organizations at all levels and the masses of farmers to ensure that the province's grain production in 1956 exceeds the planned production target for 1957. Jiangxi Province's grain output next year will further increase by 2.002 billion catties on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, which is 1.302 billion catties more than the original planned grain output for next year; it is also 840 million catties more than the planned grain output for 1957, the last year of Jiangxi Province's first local Five-Year Plan. Some well-managed agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangxi Province have already achieved an average grain yield of 1,000 catties per mu. More than 50 percent of the province's farmers will participate in agricultural production cooperatives this winter and next spring. If these cooperatives increase production by an average of 15 to 20 percent next year, the province can increase grain production by more than a billion catties. The great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement has also created very favorable conditions for further and larger-scale implementation of agricultural production increase measures. Next year, the province can increase grain production by several billion catties simply by implementing the "three changes" (changing single-season rice to double-season rice, changing dry land to paddy fields, and changing intermediate rice to early rice) on two million mu of land. With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the support and cooperation of local industrial, commercial, transportation and other related departments for agriculture has been further strengthened, which will definitely further promote agricultural production increase.
    The Shandong Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial agricultural production work conference from November 1st to 10th. The meeting proposed to strive to exceed the agricultural production increase targets for 1957 in 1956. 52 percent of farmers in Shandong Province have joined agricultural production cooperatives. The meeting believes that a new upsurge in the agricultural cooperativization movement will bring about a new upsurge in agricultural production. Many typical reports at the meeting fully demonstrated the huge potential for production increase that exists in agricultural production throughout the province. For example, Huang County developed water conservancy and meticulously planted corn, and the county had a bumper harvest, reaching 490 catties per mu. Zhang Shirui Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jimo intercropped and interplanted, achieving large-scale bumper harvests year after year, and this year created a new record of an average yield of 1,563 catties per mu, which is more than ten times the average yield per unit area in the province. The meeting pointed out that in order to strive for exceeding production increase, the following production reforms must be promoted on a large scale on the basis of cooperativization: (1) Plant high-yield crops, increase the multiple cropping area, and improve land utilization. (2) Vigorously develop farmland water conservancy, especially mass small-scale farmland water conservancy, and pay attention to soil and water conservation in mountainous areas. (3) Vigorously promote pig raising and manure collection, and develop various fertilizer sources. At the same time, increase the number of mules and horses and protect existing draught animals. (4) Improve cultivation techniques, promote double-wheeled double-shared plows, popularize improved varieties, and strengthen pest and disease prevention and control. Finally, according to the specific conditions of various regions, the meeting revised the agricultural production increase plans for special zones and counties, all of which broke through the original targets.

### 山西、江西、山东等省挖掘农业生产潜力　争取明年完成一九五七年增产指标

　　山西、江西、山东等省挖掘农业生产潜力
　　争取明年完成一九五七年增产指标
    本报讯　山西、江西、山东等省决定号召和组织农民因地制宜地采取各种措施挖掘增产潜力，争取在一九五六年完成或超额完成一九五七年的农业增产指标。
    中共山西省委根据国家工业化的需要，研究了全省农业合作化带来的新情况，认为在农业生产中还有很大的增产潜力，决定采取具体措施，争取在一九五六年完成一九五七年的增产指标。全省原计划一九五七年粮食总产量达到八十九亿六千万斤，即比一九五二年增产百分之十六；棉花总产量达到两万六千六百万斤，即增产百分之四十四。中共山西省委准备采取的具体措施，除继续深入宣传完成五年计划的意义提高群众的生产积极性，大力整顿和巩固农业生产合作社，发挥其生产优越性外；并积极加强今冬生产准备工作。明年全省水田可由现在的七百三十万亩增加到八百五十万亩，目前全省已有十万农民投入了冬季水利建设。在肥料方面，目前在全省广大青年中已展开了千车万担的积肥运动。还计划明年在省内建立一百万亩棉花增产示范区，每亩产皮棉七十七斤，计划在晋西北雁北一带扩大玉米和山药蛋的播种面积等。此外，还要大力防治蚜虫、红铃虫、玉米钻心虫等虫害，其中玉米钻心虫害明年将比今年减少一半。
    中共江西省委员会在最近举行的扩大会议上决定号召各级党的组织和农民群众，要使全省一九五六年生产的粮食超过一九五七年的计划产量指标。江西省明年的粮食产量要在今年丰收的水平上进一步增产二十亿零二千万斤，这就比原定的明年的粮食计划产量增加了十三亿零二千万斤；也比江西省第一个地方五年计划最后一年——一九五七年的粮食计划产量超过八亿四千万斤。江西省有些办得好的农业生产合作社，每亩粮食的平均产量已经达到了一千斤，全省今冬明春将有百分之五十以上的农户参加农业生产合作社，这些合作社明年如果平均增产百分之十五到二十，全省就可以增产十几亿斤粮食。农业合作化运动的大发展，还给进一步更大规模地推行农业增产措施创造了非常有利的条件。明年全省仅按在两百万亩田地里实行“三变”（变单季稻为双季稻，变旱地为水田，变中稻为早稻）计算，就可以增产几亿斤粮食。随着农业合作化运动的发展，地方工业、商业、交通运输等有关部门对农业的支援和配合已经进一步加强了，这也必定会进一步促进农业的增产。
    山东省人民委员会在十一月一日到十日召开了全省农业生产工作会议。会议提出要争取在一九五六年超额完成一九五七年农业增产指标。山东省已有百分之五十二的农户加入农业生产合作社，会议认为随着农业合作化运动的新高潮将要带来农业生产的新高潮。会上许多典型报告充分显示了全省各地在农业生产中存在着巨大增产潜力。例如黄县发展水利精种玉米，全县丰产，每亩达四百九十斤。即墨张式瑞农业生产合作社间种套作连年大面积丰产，今年创每亩平均产量一千五百六十三斤的新纪录，为全省平均单位面积产量十倍以上。会议指出：为了争取超额增产，必须在合作化基础上，大规模地推行下述生产改革：（一）播种高产作物，增加复种面积，提高土地利用率。（二）大力开展农田水利，特别是群众性小型农田水利，并注意山区水土保持。（三）大力提倡养猪积肥，并开辟各种肥源，同时要增殖骡马，保护现有耕畜。（四）提高耕作技术，推广双轮双铧犁，普及良种，加强病虫害防治工作等。会议最后根据各地具体情况修订的专区和县的农业增产规划，都突破了原先的指标。
