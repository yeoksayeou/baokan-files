    Anhui province's health departments at all levels have taken various measures to strengthen Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) work. The Provincial Health Department has appointed a vice-director specifically to manage TCM affairs; health departments in all special districts, cities, and counties have designated one person to manage TCM work exclusively or concurrently. Health Workers' Associations at all levels have elected respected TCM practitioners to participate in leadership. Some county and city hospitals have invited TCM doctors for consultations or absorbed TCM doctors into hospital work. Local people's governments have also paid attention to helping develop TCM services. For example, in Fengtai County, due to flooding last year, some TCM clinics were unable to sustain their operations, so the People's Bank of China provided loans of over 10,000 yuan to restore twenty-six TCM clinics. The Bengbu City Health Department assigned three TCM joint clinics to undertake public medical service tasks, expanding the business of these clinics.

    The Anhui Province Health Department also attaches importance to the research work of TCM. The Provincial TCM Advanced Studies School has hired ten TCM practitioners with expertise, divided into groups such as internal medicine, surgery, acupuncture, and Chinese herbal medicine, to conduct research experiments. The Huizhou Special District established a TCM Academic Exchange Committee, inviting well-known TCM practitioners to regularly study TCM academic issues. Some counties and cities have held or are planning to hold TCM amateur refresher courses and acupuncture amateur study groups. The health departments are also organizing the prescriptions contributed by TCM practitioners in various regions. A portion of single prescriptions that are known to have a scientific basis and have been clinically proven to be safe for simultaneous use have been selected, compiled into a booklet, and distributed to various health and medical units for research and trial use.

    安徽卫生部门加强中医工作
    安徽省各级卫生部门采取各种措施加强中医工作。省卫生厅已配备了专门管理中医工作的副厅长；各专署、市、县的卫生部门都指定一人专管或兼管中医工作。各级卫生工作者协会推选了较有威望的中医参加领导。有些县、市医院都邀请中医会诊，或吸收中医参加医院工作。各地人民政府并注意帮助开展中医业务。如凤台县由于去年发生水灾，部分中医诊所不能维持业务，中国人民银行便贷款一万多元，恢复了二十六个中医诊所。蚌埠市卫生部门分配三个中医联合诊所担负公费医疗的任务，扩大了这些诊所的业务。
    安徽省卫生部门还重视中医学术的研究工作。省立中医进修学校聘请了有专长的中医十人，分成内科、外科、针灸、中药等组，进行研究实验。徽州专区成立了中医学术交流委员会，聘请著名中医定期研究中医学术方面的问题。有些县、市已举办或正在筹办中医业余进修班和针灸业余学习组。卫生部门对各地中医献出的单方，也正在整理。现已选择了一部分已知有学理根据和临床经验同时服用安全的单方，编印成册，印发给各卫生医疗单位研究试用。　（新华社）
