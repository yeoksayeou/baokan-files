Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 10th: The foreign ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States continued their discussion of the first agenda item—European security and the German problem—at their ninth meeting on the 9th. The meeting was chaired by Pinay.

　　Macmillan spoke first. According to him, Molotov's speech after returning from Moscow did not make a beneficial contribution to resolving the problems facing the four foreign ministers, but rather adopted a more negative attitude towards it. The Soviet government's disagreement with holding free elections throughout Germany has created a very serious situation. I don't know what good it will do to continue discussing the first agenda item. Our failure here cannot but affect our spirit when discussing the second and third agenda items.

　　Macmillan said, however, that he would like to briefly summarize the results of the work so far. He believes that these results include: a valuable exchange of views, in the process of which certain progress has been made. On the other hand, there has also been a major loss, namely the loss of confidence in the future. Macmillan insisted that the Soviet Union wanted to force Germany to accept the system currently implemented in East Germany, or to keep Germany in a state of division. He emphasized that the Western countries would not abandon the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union.

　　Dulles then spoke. He insisted that the Soviet Union had violated the instructions of the four heads of government, while the Western countries were faithfully implementing these instructions. He insisted that the Soviet Union wanted to permanently divide Germany, and that this division would pose a threat to European security. In this regard, he also mentioned the lessons of the Treaty of Versailles.

　　Next, Dulles expressed his views on the impact of the Soviet Union's position on overall international relations. He said that the results of the discussion of the first agenda item had led to some agreements on a series of issues related to guaranteeing security. However, when the meeting proceeded to discuss the issue of reunifying Germany, the Soviet delegation refused to discuss the proposals of the Western countries. According to Dulles, it seemed that the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German committee did not stipulate that this committee should bear any responsibility for reunifying Germany. Dulles said that the Soviet government's refusal to seriously discuss the issue of restoring German unity would have an adverse effect on the overall relationship between the Soviet Union and other countries, including the United States. As far as the United States is concerned, what has happened here has largely undermined the trust created by the heads of government meeting. He also said that, of course, even countries that do not have confidence in the agreements reached by the highest-level people can establish peaceful and limited relations with each other, but in this case the relations will be difficult and restricted.

　　Dulles added: We do not want to return to the situation before the four heads of government met. We believe that our goal is to continue to strive for a just and lasting peace with all the means at our disposal.

　　After Dulles spoke, Pinay also repeated the arguments of Macmillan and Dulles. He insisted that the proposals of the Western countries provided a guarantee of security for countries bordering Germany. He also said that the proposals of the Western countries could be modified or improved. Pinay insisted that the Soviet Union had not put forward anything concrete or realistic.

　　Molotov then spoke.

　　In his speech, Molotov responded to the speeches of Macmillan, Dulles, and Pinay. He first refuted Dulles's claim that the Soviet delegation had not correctly implemented the instructions of the four heads of government. He pointed out that some people here were attempting to reduce the issue of European security and Germany to the issue of all-German elections, attempting to put the German issue in first place, while downgrading the issue of European security, which was listed as the first priority in the instructions, to a secondary issue. This was a violation of the instructions of the heads of government. The instructions of the four heads of government did not say that a reunified Germany must participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, nor did they say that West Germany, which had already embarked on the road of remilitarization and participated in the military blocs of the Western countries, must annex East Germany, but the Western countries wanted the Soviet Union to accept these propositions.

　　Molotov then refuted Pinay's claim that the guarantee treaty proposed by the three Western countries contained the necessary security guarantees for the Soviet Union and other European countries. He pointed out that this treaty would not finally come into effect until a reunified Germany decided to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. Therefore, this was not a question of offering guarantees to the Soviet Union and other countries, but merely a question of dragging the whole of Germany into their military blocs and using these blocs to oppose other countries.

　　Molotov then pointed out that Pinay also insisted that the Soviet Union had not put forward its own proposals, but the Soviet Union had put forward its own proposals on European security and the German problem. The Soviet government first proposed concluding an all-European treaty on European collective security, and later proposed concluding a European security treaty, and suggested establishing a region in Europe for limiting and inspecting armaments. In addition, the Soviet Union also put forward proposals on the German problem. However, none of these proposals were heeded by the Western countries.

　　Molotov then spoke about the German problem. He accused the Western countries of refusing to listen to the opinions of the Germans. He then said that Dulles had talked about the Treaty of Versailles and its consequences, but if the Treaty of Versailles gave us any lessons, the first and foremost was that it opened the door for the revival of German militarism, which eventually led to Hitler's aggression, because some countries liked the policy of establishing military blocs and did not like working together to prevent aggression.

　　Speaking of the issue of all-German elections, Molotov said that the Soviet Union had always been in favor of free all-German elections, but there were currently no conditions for holding all-German elections immediately. Molotov emphasized the need to establish contact between West and East Germany to promote German reunification, and supported the proposal of the German Democratic Republic to establish an all-German committee. Molotov pointed out that the German problem should now be left to the Germans themselves to consider. As long as the Germans themselves have not reached an agreement and put forward their joint proposals for us to consider, our attempts to impose a certain solution on the Germans from the outside will not succeed.

　　Finally, speaking of the "Geneva spirit," Molotov said that the Soviet Union believes that it is incorrect to play with words such as trust and distrust. The Soviet Union takes the word trust very seriously and believes that building trust is truly in the interests of all countries represented at this meeting, and not just in their interests. We believe that the exchange of views we are conducting will help to clarify the issues we are discussing. Our views on some issues are already closer, although we have not yet reached a consensus on some fundamental issues. We believe that to act in the "Geneva spirit" is to continue to persevere in striving to bring our views closer on issues on which we have not yet reached a consensus. And everything that leads to consolidating peace and easing international tensions, and that leads to establishing genuine security in Europe, is truly in line with the "Geneva spirit."

　　Molotov mentioned that the Soviet delegation had put forward a major proposal to withdraw foreign troops from German territory (leaving only limited forces) within three months. He said that if the three Western countries were unwilling to accept this proposal, then the Soviet government proposed not to discuss the issue of troop withdrawal, but to discuss the issue of substantially reducing the number of foreign troops stationed in Germany. For example, the Soviet delegation proposed reducing the troops stationed in Germany by the four countries by 50 percent, and when we proposed reducing the troops of the four countries stationed on German territory by 50 percent, we also proposed reducing the total armed forces of each of the four countries by the number of troops withdrawn from Germany.

　　Molotov presented the Soviet delegation's proposal on the basic principles of treaties between existing national groups in Europe for the meeting's consideration. The proposal stated:

　　The governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Britain, in the spirit of consolidating peace and believing that it is necessary to do everything possible to ease international tensions and build trust in international relations, agree: to conclude a treaty between the participating countries of the North Atlantic Treaty and the Western European Union as one party, and the participating countries of the Warsaw Treaty as the other party. This treaty can be based on the following principles:

　　One, the two contracting parties guarantee not to use force against each other. This obligation shall not prejudice the right of the contracting parties to exercise the right of individual or collective self-defense stipulated in Article 51 of the United Nations Charter when subjected to armed attack.

　　Two, the contracting parties guarantee to consult each other when disagreements or disputes arise between them that may constitute a threat to the maintenance of peace in Europe.

　　Three, the treaty is temporary in nature, and its validity period will last until it is replaced by a treaty on the establishment of a European collective security system.

　　Macmillan suggested suspending the discussion on the first agenda item and proceeding to discuss the second agenda item—the issue of disarmament—at the next meeting.

　　Molotov said that the Soviet delegation did not object to further discussion of the first agenda item after the ministers had discussed the second and third agenda items.

　　The next meeting will be held on the afternoon of November 10.

### 四国外长会议九日继续讨论首项议程

　　四国外长会议九日继续讨论首项议程
    新华社十日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十日讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长九日在第九次会议上继续讨论第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题。会议由比内担任主席。
    麦克米伦第一个发言。照他说，莫洛托夫从莫斯科回来以后所作的发言，对于解决四国外长面临的问题并没有作出有益的贡献，却对它采取了更加否定的态度。苏联政府不再同意在全德范围内举行自由选举造成了十分严重的情况。我不知道，继续讨论第一项议程还会有什么好处。我们在这里的失败不能不影响到我们在讨论第二项和第三项议程时的精神。
    麦克米伦说，然而他想简述一下到目前为止的工作成果。他认为，这些结果包括：宝贵地交换了意见，在交换意见的过程中取得了一定的进展。另一方面，也有重大的损失，就是对未来丧失了信心。麦克米伦硬说苏联要想强迫德国接受现在东德所实行的那种制度，或是使德国仍旧处于分裂状态。他强调，西方国家不会放弃北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟。
    杜勒斯接着发言。他硬说苏联违反四国政府首脑指示，而西方国家在忠实地执行这个指示。他硬说苏联想使德国永久分裂，而这种分裂会对欧洲安全造成威胁。他在这方面还提到凡尔赛条约的教训。
    接着，杜勒斯就苏联的立场对整个国际关系的影响表示了他的看法。他说，第一项议程的讨论结果已经使有关保障安全的一系列问题得到了一些协议。然而，在会议进而讨论关于重新统一德国问题的时候，苏联代表团拒绝讨论西方国家的建议。根据杜勒斯的说法，仿佛苏联关于建立全德委员会的建议没有规定这个委员会在重新统一德国方面应负任何责任。杜勒斯说，苏联政府拒绝认真讨论恢复德国统一问题，这将对苏联同其他国家，其中包括同美国的总的关系起着不良的影响。就美国而言，这里所发生的事情在很大程度上破坏了政府首脑会议所造成的信任。他又说，当然，即使那些对最高级人士所达成的协议没有信心的国家彼此之间也可以建立和平和有限的关系，但是，在这种情况下的关系将是困难重重的和有限制的。
    杜勒斯又说：我们不希望回到四国政府首脑会议之前的那种情况。我们认为，我们的目标是用我们现有的一切方法继续为争取正义的和持久的和平而斗争。
    杜勒斯发言后，比内也重复了麦克米伦和杜勒斯的论点。他硬说西方国家的建议提供了同德国毗邻国家安全的保证。他又说，西方国家的建议是可以修改或者改善的。比内硬说苏联没有提出任何具体的、现实的东西。
    接着由莫洛托夫发言。
    莫洛托夫在发言中答复了麦克米伦、杜勒斯和比内的发言。他首先驳斥了杜勒斯所谓苏联代表团没有正确执行四国政府首脑指示的说法。他指出，这里有人企图把欧洲安全和德国问题缩小成为全德选举问题，企图把德国问题放在第一位，而把指示中列为第一位欧洲安全的问题降为次要问题，这才是违反了政府首脑的指示。四国政府首脑的指示并没有说重新统一的德国必须参加北大西洋公约组织，也没有说已经走上重新军国主义化道路和参加西方国家军事集团的西德必须吞并东德，但是西方国家却要苏联接受这些主张。
    莫洛托夫接着驳斥了比内所谓西方三国提出的保证条约包含了对苏联和其他欧洲国家的必要安全保证的说法。他指出，这个条约要到重新统一后的德国决定参加北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟的时候才最后生效。因此，这不是向苏联和其他国家提出保证的问题，而只是把整个德国拖入它们的军事集团并且利用这个集团来反对其他国家的问题。
    莫洛托夫接着指出，比内还硬说苏联没有提出自己的建议，但是苏联是提出了自己关于欧洲安全和德国问题的建议的。苏联政府首先建议缔结一个关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约，后来又建议缔结一个欧洲安全条约，并且建议在欧洲设立一个限制和视察军备的地区。此外，苏联还提出了关于德国问题的建议。但是，所有这些建议都没有被西方国家理会。
    莫洛托夫接着谈到德国问题。他指责西方国家拒绝听取德国人的意见。他接着说，杜勒斯谈到了凡尔赛条约以及它的后果，但是如果凡尔赛条约给了我们什么教训的话，那首先就是，那时为复活德国军国主义打开了大门，终于造成希特勒的侵略，这是因为某些国家喜欢建立军事集团的政策，而不喜欢共同努力来防止侵略。
    莫洛托夫在谈到全德选举的问题时说，苏联始终是全德自由选举的主张者，但是目前还没有立即举行全德选举的条件。莫洛托夫强调指出目前西德和东德之间建立接触以促进德国重新统一的必要，并且支持德意志民主共和国关于建立全德委员会的建议。莫洛托夫指出，现在应该把德国问题交给德国人自己去考虑，只要德国人自己没有达成协议，提出他们的联合建议供我们考虑，我们企图从外部把某种解决办法强加于德国人就不会成功。
    莫洛托夫最后在谈到“日内瓦精神”时说，苏联认为，玩弄信任不信任这样一些字眼是不正确的。苏联非常认真地对待信任这样一些字眼，并且认为建立信任是真正符合有代表参加这次会议的所有国家的利益的，而且不光是符合它们的利益的。我们相信我们进行的意见交换将有助于阐明我们所讨论的问题。我们在某些问题上的看法已经比较接近了，虽然我们在一些基本问题上的确还没有取得一致的意见。我们认为：本着“日内瓦精神”行事就是要继续坚持不渝地努力使我们在现在还没有取得一致意见的问题上的看法比较接近。而一切导致巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势、导致在欧洲建立真正的安全的事情就是真正符合于“日内瓦精神”。
    莫洛托夫提到，苏联代表团提出了关于在三个月内从德国领土上撤退外国军队（只留下有限的部队）的重大建议。他说，如果西方三国不愿意接受这个建议，那末苏联政府建议不讨论撤军问题，而讨论大量裁减驻德外国军队的问题。譬如苏联代表团建议裁减四国驻德军队百分之五十，我们在提议裁减四国在德国领土上的军队百分之五十的时候，同时提议从四国的每一国的武装部队总额中裁减相当于从德国撤退的军队的人数。
    莫洛托夫提出苏联代表团关于欧洲现有的国家集团之间的条约的基本原则的建议供会议考虑。建议说：
    苏、美、法、英四国政府本着巩固和平的愿望并且认为必须尽一切可能来缓和国际紧张局势和建立国际关系中的信任，同意：以北大西洋公约和西欧联盟的参加国作为一方，以华沙条约的参加国作为另一方，它们之间缔结一项条约。这个条约可以依据下列原则：
      一、缔约国双方保证互不使用武力。这种义务不应当损害缔约国在受到武装进攻时行使联合国宪章第五十一条规定的单独或集体自卫的权利。
    二、缔约国在它们之间发生可能构成对维持欧洲和平的威胁的分歧或争端时，保证互相进行协商。
    三、条约具有临时性质，它的有效期限直到它被关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的条约替代时为止。
    麦克米伦建议暂停关于第一项议程的讨论，并且在下次会议上着手讨论第二项议程——裁军问题。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团不反对在部长们讨论第二项和第三项议程之后，再对第一项议程作进一步的讨论。
    下次会议将在十一月十日下午举行。
