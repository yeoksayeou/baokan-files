    It's not the masses who are backward, it's me who has fallen behind the masses
To the Editor:
    After studying Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperation, I felt both excited and ashamed. Excited because a new upsurge in the agricultural cooperation movement has arrived; ashamed because I have consistently displayed serious right-leaning ideas in the mutual aid and cooperation movement over the past few years.

    After studying the General Line in 1953, I also participated in an agricultural producers' cooperative, but my thinking was still very vague. I only talked about the beautiful prospects of socialism and the superiority of cooperatives, etc., but I did not actively lead the farmers in my township on the road to collectivization in my actual work. As a result, the two original small cooperatives in my township did not develop. Last year, my township originally planned to build two more small cooperatives, and the framework had already been set up; however, when I saw some difficulties in the construction of the cooperatives, instead of actively helping them to solve them, I complained that the masses were "backward" and shouted that "the conditions were not ripe," resulting in the failure to build the two small cooperatives.

    In the past, whenever I went to the county and district meetings, I felt annoyed when I heard comrades from other townships talk about how many cooperatives they had established and how many cooperative members they had developed, especially when someone asked about the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives in our township. However, instead of blaming myself for lagging behind, I blamed the masses in our township for being "backward"; sometimes I even thought that the rapid development of the cooperative movement in other townships was "blindly reckless," and that only I had mastered the principle of "steady progress."

    I also lacked a clear understanding of the Party's class line in the countryside, and mistakenly believed that poor peasants had little land, lacked livestock, and had incomplete farm implements, and that there was no benefit in absorbing them into the cooperatives. Therefore, when Wang Shangwei and Wang Zhanchao, two poor peasant households in my township, came to me several times to ask to join the cooperative, I told them to go to the cooperative chairman, but at the same time, I notified the cooperative chairman not to accept them. Finally, they came to me again, and I actually said to them: "You are all poor peasant households. If you join the cooperative, you will no longer be able to do odd jobs outside. What will you do if you have difficulties? The cooperative is newly established, and we are not sure whether it can increase production. Wait outside for another year or two!" In this way, I kept the poor peasants outside the gate of the cooperative, and instead shouted loudly that the masses were "backward."

    After studying Chairman Mao's report, I deeply felt that I had fallen far behind the masses' awareness and the development of the situation! I am a Party branch secretary, but I do not lead the peasants on the road to socialism. I am really sorry for the trust the masses have placed in me, and I am sorry for the Party's education and training!

    Now, I assure the Party that I will resolutely correct my mistakes! I will definitely follow the principles and methods Chairman Mao has told us, rely on Party members and the broad masses, do a good job in the collectivization plan for my township, run the existing cooperatives well, and carry out the work of developing cooperatives in a planned and prepared manner, and catch up in the high tide of collectivization!

            Wang Zhanshan, Secretary of the Pingjiatuan Township Branch of the Communist Party of China, Tong County

### 不是群众落后，是我落在群众后面了

    不是群众落后，是我落在群众后面了编辑同志：
    学习了毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告以后，我感到又是兴奋，又是惭愧。兴奋的是农业合作化运动的新高潮已经到来了；惭愧的是这几年来我在互助合作运动中一直表现了严重的右倾思想。
    一九五三年学习了总路线以后，我也参加了农业生产合作社，但是思想还是很模糊的。我只是在口头上讲讲社会主义的美好远景和合作社的优越性等等；而没有在实际工作中积极领导我乡农民走合作化的道路。因此，我乡原有的两个小社都没有得到发展。去年我乡原来准备再建两个小社，已经搭起了架子；但是我看到建社中出现的一些困难，不是积极帮助他们解决，却埋怨群众“落后”，叫喊“条件不成熟”，结果使得两个小社没有能建成。
    过去我每到县、区开会的时候，一听到其他乡的同志谈起他们已经建立了多少社、发展了多少户社员，特别是有人问起我们乡里农业生产合作社发展情况的时候，就觉得心烦。但是，我不怪自己落后，却埋怨我们乡里的群众“落后”；有时候甚至还认为别的乡合作化运动发展得快是“盲目冒进”，只有我才掌握了“稳步前进”的方针。
    我对于党在农村的阶级路线也缺乏明确的认识，错误地认为贫农土地少、牲畜缺、农具不全，吸收他们入社没有油水。因此，当我乡王尚为、王占潮两户贫农几次找我要求入社的时候，我让他们去找社长，同时却又通知社长不要吸收他们。最后他们又来找我，我竟对他们说：“你们都是贫农户，入了社再不能出外做零工，有了困难怎么办呢？合作社是初办，能不能增产还不敢肯定，你们再在外边等一、二年吧！”就这样我把贫农关在合作社的大门外边，反而大声叫嚷群众“落后”。
    学习了毛主席的报告，我深深感到自己已经远远落在群众觉悟和形势发展的后头了！我是一个党支部书记，却不去领导农民走社会主义的道路，真是对不起群众对我的信托，对不起党对我的教育和培养！
    现在，我向党保证：一定要坚决改正我的错误！我一定按着毛主席告诉我们的方针和办法、依靠党员和广大群众，作好我乡的合作化规划，办好现有的合作社，并有计划、有准备地进行发展社的工作，在合作化的高潮中赶上去！
            中共通县平家疃乡支部书记　王占山
