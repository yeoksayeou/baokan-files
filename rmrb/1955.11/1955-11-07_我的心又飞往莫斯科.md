Though it is already early winter evening outside the window, my room is filled with the warmth of spring. Because letters from Moscow, Leningrad, Novosibirsk... cities where the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe visited and performed, are being opened in my hands. Each page of stationery, like the sunshine of spring, pierces through the torn-open envelope, and the warmth of friendship rushes out, pouring out the passion of longing to the people. Whether it's Nina and Lyuba in Moscow, or Mikhailkov in Leningrad, or Katya in Sverdlovsk, they all express the same sentiment in different words: friendship.

Like me, my comrades also received many letters. Whenever someone receives a letter from a Soviet friend, she shares it with everyone around her like receiving a letter from home, letting everyone share the warmth of that great friendship. Whenever anyone writes a letter to a Soviet friend, she is surrounded by many people, saying, "Say hello to him for me!" So, she has to write on the letter: "My comrades eagerly send their greetings to you! Wish you greater achievements!" Because there are so many people sending greetings, it would be inconsiderate to mention some and omit others. This is the close friendship established between the Chinese and Soviet people after the Shanghai Yue Opera Troupe's visit and performance in the Soviet Union.

These past few days, we have all been awaiting a festive holiday—the 38th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and our hearts are as jubilant as if we were awaiting our own National Day.

These days, memories seem to play a particularly strong role in our emotions, constantly leading us back to the happy and joyful days spent in the great friendly country two months ago, making it difficult for people to restrain their excitement.

I remember: On this day of the October Revolution, the Novosibirsk Bridge spanning the Ob River would be completed. When we went to Novosibirsk, the workers there told us this. The construction of this bridge is magnificent, and it will connect the working people on both sides, linking the industrial area of Novosibirsk with the agricultural area on the opposite bank. This bridge is very beautiful, and it is a part of the future scenic area. Siberia, the desolate and frigid land where political prisoners were exiled during the Tsarist era, Siberia where Comrades Stalin and Sverdlov once fought, is now a rich land with factories and abundant crops. The Ural Heavy Machinery Plant is "striving to overfulfill the task of completing Chinese orders!" We visited collective farms here, where fertile land nurtured fruitful crops. We met with model pig farmers of the collective farm, Stalin Prize winners. They are ordinary but great people who have raised pigs for about thirty years, making great contributions to the Soviet motherland. The people have given them the honor they deserve, but they believe that devoting their youth to the socialist-communist cause is the greatest happiness. This high degree of patriotism is common to every Soviet person.

The All-Union Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow attracted us. On the majestic multi-arched gate, there stand statues of tractor drivers and female collective farm members holding high golden ears of wheat. Stepping into the gate, a wide tree-lined avenue unfolds before you, and the fruit trees, flowers, and fountains on both sides beckon to you, full of life.

In the exhibition, we saw the rich products of the sixteen Soviet republics. These products all signify the victory of agricultural collectivization under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, reflecting the development path of Soviet economic and cultural life, the inseparable alliance between the working class and the collective farmers, the state's concern for the people's welfare, and the Soviet Union's struggle to defend and consolidate world peace. In the exhibition, people not only see the new harvests and achievements in agriculture, but also the huge impact of industrial development on agricultural production; people not only see the major reforms in agricultural technology, but also the wealthy lives and rich cultural lives of ordinary Soviet farmers; people not only see the current state of Soviet agriculture, but also the growth process of Soviet agriculture under the leadership of the party of Lenin and Stalin; people not only see the present of Soviet agriculture, but also the future of Soviet agriculture...

When we saw the two largest fountains in the square, it was hard to imagine that we were in an exhibition, and we felt as if we had arrived in a mythical world. One is surrounded by a crop, with golden statues of goddesses from the sixteen republics standing around it. Water shoots out from all directions, and the changing colored lights reflect each other, transforming into various water patterns. The sixteen golden goddesses seem to be dancing gracefully. The other is a fountain where water shoots out from all sides, and the water is reflected by the changing colored lights and sprayed into the pool, where a gem flower made of colored glass blooms. These two fountains, plus the surrounding forests and flowers also changing with colored lights, constitute an incomparably beautiful picture, truly "people in the painting".

When we recently read Chairman Mao's article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation", we felt unspeakable joy when we recalled what we saw at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition, because the bright future of agricultural cooperation in our motherland is what the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition showed. The exhibition vividly and clearly tells us that the industrialization and agricultural cooperation of the motherland will lead our country into a prosperous socialist society.

Moscow is the great city I have come to for the second time. I remember when I came to Moscow in 1950, the foundation of Moscow University on Lenin Hills had just been laid. Now it stands tall and majestic on Lenin Hills, and it is said that it will be an urban area with a million people in the future. Many of the new buildings in Moscow I had not seen before, and now they have welcomed new owners. Although we did not go to see the great project of communism, we can feel the pulse of communism beating everywhere in Moscow and other cities.

Yue Opera was meeting with the unfamiliar Soviet audience for the first time. The "Romance of the West Chamber" and "Butterfly Lovers," performed by the Yue Opera Troupe, introduced a new concept of Chinese opera to the Soviet audience.

After the first performance of Yue Opera in Moscow, it was immediately welcomed by the audience. I deeply know that no matter how well we perform, the warm applause from the audience is not only thanks for our meager artistic labor, but first of all, it is the Soviet people's respect for our motherland, our people, and the long-standing cultural traditions she has created, and the glorious cause led by the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

After our performance, the female director of the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theatre, Kemarskaya Georgina Melzer, and the female director of the film "The Grand Concert," repeatedly asked me about the movements of my hands. They dragged me, stroked my hands, and looked at them carefully, saying, "Let me see your hands! How do your hands move? Sometimes it's like in life, and sometimes it dances. How beautiful, how pleasant, how handy and free you move!" Faced with these compliments, I felt very uneasy. Their artistic achievements are much higher than ours. If they are praising me, it is better to say that they are praising the "free" performance tradition created by our senior artists.

The Soviet People's Artist, the famous ballet dancer Lebesinskaya, is a lovely and enthusiastic person. She is cheerful, humorous, sincere and simple. She and I became friends at first sight and became confidantes. She humbly said to me: "After watching your performance of 'Romance of the West Chamber', it reminded me of the peach blossom I played in the ballet 'Red Poppy Flower'. Your performance made me realize that my understanding and handling of her is a bit wrong." She told me that she wanted to recreate this character. Her words deeply moved me. The rigorous and humble attitude of Soviet artists towards artistic labor is worthy of emulation by each of us. We parted in Moscow, and later, when we were about to leave Leningrad, she specially came from Moscow to see us off. We bid farewell in Leningrad like sisters, not knowing when we would meet again? Fortunately, when celebrating the 6th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, she came to the motherland of Chinese friends as a member of the Soviet cultural delegation. When we met again at the Beijing Airport, our hearts were about to jump out of joy. I sincerely hope that she can meet with our audience and let us learn from her exquisite and outstanding performing arts.

The Soviet People's Artist, the outstanding puppeteer Obraztsov, is still as enthusiastic and humorous as when we first met in Beijing during the celebration of the 35th anniversary of the October Revolution in 1952. He is particularly kind to Chinese friends. It was like a "meeting an old friend in a foreign land" when we met again in Moscow. Knowing that we wanted to eat Chinese food, he prepared preserved eggs, jellyfish, and sea cucumbers at home to receive his Chinese colleagues. He loves Chinese art as much as he loves Russian art. His home is full of Chinese carvings, paintings, puppets, embroidery... We sang a section in his home and recorded it, and he also played the singing of Comrades Chen Shufang and Chen Bohua when they visited the Soviet Union last year for us to listen to. He cherishes these clear songs very much. He told us that he is writing a book introducing Chinese local operas. We once again enjoyed the wonderful program he performed for us: the drunk and the lullaby. This night, we felt like we had returned to our own home.

The leaders of the Communist Party and government of the Soviet Union, Comrades Voroshilov and others, watched our performance. They entertained us and gave us flowers. Comrade Voroshilov said: "Your art not only expresses the suffering of the people, like the 'Butterfly Transformation' scene, but also expresses the will and strength of the people." After he finished speaking, he raised his glass to toast the health of Chairman Mao.

There is an old Chinese saying: "People miss their loved ones more during festivals." As the 38th anniversary of the October Revolution approaches, this feeling of missing loved ones is particularly strong for us. These days, the figures of those lovely Soviet friends are constantly appearing before me. I remember when I went to Warsaw in 1950 to attend the World Peace Congress, I spent this great festival on the train. Head of the delegation Guo Moruo invited all of our comrades to celebrate this festival with the Soviet friends on the train. Everyone was extremely excited to be able to celebrate the festival on Soviet soil, but people were still dissatisfied that they could not go to Moscow to see the respected Comrade Stalin review the grand military parade and parade. So someone said: "Wouldn't it have been possible to catch up with the Moscow festival if we had left a few days earlier?" These days, the comrades in the theater and I are also naively saying: "Wouldn't it have been possible to participate in the October Revolution if we had left later?"

This year, I spent a happy day in the capital of the motherland during the National Day. When I stood under the majestic Tiananmen Gate Tower and saw my most respected father and leader Chairman Mao ascending the Tiananmen Gate Tower in the music of "The East is Red", and saw him and the leaders of the Party and the government reviewing our heroic soldiers, the defenders of the construction of the motherland, the People's Liberation Army, and the joyful and boiling crowds; I looked at the friends from the Soviet cultural delegation and the Soviet artists delegation standing on the viewing platform, they were talking and laughing, watching the teams receiving the review one by one, and from time to time, like us, they looked back to see Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and government on the Tiananmen Gate Tower; I also saw friends from various people's democratic countries and capitalist countries, and I was very excited. "Peace-friendship-culture" connects us together. At this time, I couldn't help but think of Red Square, think of the joyful scenes of May Day or the October Revolution, and in the melodious military music in Tiananmen, I seemed to hear the bells of the Kremlin. When the balloons and white doves in the children's hands flew over Tiananmen Square, I thought of the blue-eyed, brown-eyed, and yellow-eyed children I had hugged and kissed in the Soviet Union, who had said to me: "Say hello to the Chinese children!"...

On the eve of celebrating the 38th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, my heart seems to have flown to Moscow again. We and the Soviet people are celebrating our festival together. I remember when the Chinese Yue Opera Troupe was about to return home, we naturally talked about our motherland. Comrade Shemyonigetch, who received us, said excitedly and innocently: "You miss your motherland again! Don't talk about it! Good things often pass quickly. The month or so you have been here is like a day..." He told us not to call us "you" and "us". He said:

"We are we! We—the Yue Opera Troupe and the reception group—are one unit." The word "we" does contain this profound meaning. Here, I would like to send a message to my Soviet friends: My comrades and I are always in your midst! Comrade Voroshilov once told us not to forget to visit them when we go to Moscow again next time. I always remember this instruction, and I am always by their side!

The common cause and ideals closely connect us. The Soviet communist construction cause and our country's socialist construction cause are boiling, and the voices of the Chinese and Soviet people are connected!

### 我的心又飞往莫斯科

    我的心又飞往莫斯科
    袁雪芬
    窗外虽说已经是初冬的夜晚，可是我的屋子里却充满了春天的温暖。因为一封封从莫斯科、列宁格勒、新西伯利亚……这些中国越剧团访问演出过的城市的来信，在我的手中拆开，每页信笺像春天的阳光一样，透过被撕开了的封口，友谊的温暖冲了出来，向人们倾吐着思念的激情。不论是莫斯科的尼娜和柳芭，还是列宁格勒的米海尔柯夫以及斯维尔德洛夫斯克的卡佳，他们用不同的词句说出了共同的话语：友谊。
    同志们和我一样，她们也收到好些信。每当一个人收到苏联朋友的来信时，她会像收到家信似地向周围的人传播开来，让大家共同享受着那伟大友谊的温暖。每当任何一个人给苏联朋友写信的时候，她旁边会拥着许多人，你一言我一语地说：“替我问他的好！”于是，她只得在信上这样写着：“我的同志们热切地问您的好！祝您获得更大成就！”因为问好的人很多，写了这个丢了那个反而不周到。——这就是上海越剧院在苏联作了访问演出后，中国人和苏维埃人建立起来的亲密友谊。
    这几天来，我们都等待一个喜庆的节日——伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年，我们的心情像是等待着自己祖国的国庆节似的欢腾。
    这几天，回忆似乎在感情中起着特别强烈的作用，回忆不时把我们引进前两个月在伟大友邦所渡过的幸福而欢悦的日子中去，使人们难以克制自己的激动。
    我想起：就在十月革命节的这天，横跨鄂毕河两岸的新西伯利亚大桥，要落成了。——我们在去到新西伯利亚时，那儿的工人这样告诉过我。这座桥的工程是雄伟的，它将联系着两岸的劳动人民，使新西伯利亚的工业区和对岸的农业区联结起来。这座桥是很美丽的，它是未来风景区的一个组成部分。过去帝俄时代流放政治犯的荒凉严寒的西伯利亚，斯大林和斯维尔德洛夫同志曾经在这儿流放过战斗过的西伯利亚，如今已是工厂林立、嘉禾遍处的富饶之乡了。乌拉尔重型机器厂在“为完成中国订货的超额任务而努力！”我们参观过这里的集体农庄，肥沃的土地哺育出果实累累的庄稼。我们会见了集体农庄的养猪模范、斯大林奖金获得者，她们是平凡而伟大的人，她们已经养了三十年左右的猪，为苏维埃祖国作了巨大贡献，人民给予了她们以应有的荣誉，但她们却认为能把自己的青春奉献给社会主义—共产主义事业是最大幸福。这种高度的爱国主义思想，是每个苏维埃人普遍具有的。
    莫斯科举行的全苏农业展览会吸引了我们。雄伟的多拱的大门上，伫立着拖拉机手和女集体农庄庄员高擎金黄麦穗的塑像。跨入大门，宽阔的林荫大道向你舒展开来，道旁两侧的果木、花卉、喷泉在向你招手，它们充满了生命。
    在展览会里，我们看到了苏维埃十六个加盟共和国的丰富物产。这些产品，都标志着在苏联共产党领导下农业集体化的胜利，反映了苏联经济和文化生活的发展道路，工人阶级对集体农民不可分离的联盟关系，国家对人民福利的关怀，以及苏联对保卫和巩固世界和平的斗争。在展览会里，人们不仅看到农业的新收获新成就，而且看到工业发展对农业生产的巨大影响；人们不仅看到农业技术上的重大改革，而且看到普通苏联农庄庄员的富裕生活和丰富的文化生活；人们不仅看到今天苏联农业的状况，而且看到苏联农业在列宁斯大林的党的领导下的成长过程；人们不仅看到苏联农业的今天，而且看到了苏联农业的明天……
    当我们看到广场上最大的两座喷泉时，我们很难想像自己置身在展览会里，而像是到了神话世界一般。一座是围着一棵农作物，立着十六个加盟共和国的金色女神塑像，泉水从各处喷射出来，和变幻的彩色电灯交映着，幻化出各色水花，十六个金色女神，像在翩翩起舞；另一座是泉水从四面射出，泉水被变幻的彩色电灯映照着朝池中喷洒，池中开放着一颗用彩色玻璃砌成的宝石花。这两座喷泉，加上周围也用彩色灯光变幻着的树林花卉，构成了瑰美无比的图画，真是“人在画中”了。
    当我们最近读到毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的文章后，再回想在全苏农业展览会所见真有说不出的欢喜，因为祖国农业合作化的美好未来，就是全苏农业展览会所展现出来的。展览会生动明确的告诉我们：祖国工业化和农业合作化将把我国引进富强的社会主义社会。
    莫斯科，是我第二次来到的伟大城市。记得一九五○年我到莫斯科时，列宁山上的莫斯科大学刚打好地基，如今它已高耸入云地巍立在列宁山上了，据说它未来将是一个拥有百万人口的城区。莫斯科好些新建大厦是我前次没有见过的，如今它们已经接待了新的主人。我们虽然没到共产主义的伟大工程去看一下，但莫斯科和其它城市，随处都可以感到共产主义的脉搏在跳跃。
    越剧，是第一次和陌生的苏联观众见面。越剧团演出的“西厢记”和“梁山伯与祝英台”将中国戏曲给苏联观众介绍了一个新的概念。
    越剧在莫斯科首次演出后，立即受到了观众的欢迎。我深深知道，不管我们演得如何，观众席里传来的热烈掌声，不仅是对我们艺术的微薄劳动的谢意，首先是苏联人民对我们祖国、人民，和她创造的悠久文化传统，对伟大的中国共产党、毛主席所领导的辉煌事业，所表示的敬意。
    我们演出之后，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米洛维奇—丹钦柯音乐剧院的女导演凯玛尔斯卡娅·戈尔吉娜·麦尔泽和影片“大音乐会”的女导演，反复问我手的动作，她们拖着我，抚摩着我的手，端详着说：“我看看你的手！你的手是怎样动作的？一会儿像是在生活里似的，一会儿又舞蹈起来了。你动作得多么美，多么愉快，多么得心应手而又无拘无束！”面对着这些赞美，我很感到不安，她们在艺术上的造诣比我们高得多。如果说他们是赞美我，毋宁说是在赞美我们的先辈艺术家所创造的这种“自由”的表演传统。
    苏联人民演员、著名的芭蕾舞蹈家列别辛斯卡娅，是个可爱而又热情的人，她爽朗多趣而又真诚朴实，她和我一见如故而成了知己。她谦虚地对我说：“看了你们演出的‘西厢记’，使我想起了我在舞剧‘红罂粟花’里扮演的桃花，你们的演出使我发现我对她的理解和处理有点不对头了。”她告诉我：她要重新创造这个人物。她的话使我深深感动，苏维埃艺术家对艺术劳动严谨虚心的态度，值得我们每个人学习仿效。我们在莫斯科分手，后来，我们将离开列宁格勒时，她从莫斯科又特地赶来送我们。我们像亲姊妹似的在列宁格勒告别，不知道什么时候再聚？幸运的是当庆祝中华人民共和国六周年国庆节时，她作为苏联文化代表团的一员来到了中国朋友的祖国，我们在北京机场再见时，心都要欢腾得跳了出来。我衷心期待她能和我国观众见面，让我们向她精湛卓越的表演艺术好好学习一下。
    苏联人民演员、杰出的木偶艺术家奥布拉兹卓夫，他依然像一九五二年庆祝十月革命节三十五周年在北京和我们初遇时那样热情诙谐，他待中国朋友分外亲切，在莫斯科和他再聚，真有“他乡遇故知”的感触。他知道我们想吃中国菜，于是就在家里备了皮蛋、海蜇、海参来接待他的中国同行。他爱中国艺术就如爱俄罗斯艺术一样，他家中布满了中国的雕刻、绘画、木偶、刺绣……我们在他家里清唱了一段录了音，他还播放了去年访苏时陈书舫、陈伯华同志的清唱给我们听，他非常珍爱这些清唱。他告诉我们，他正在写一本介绍中国地方戏曲的书，我们再一次地欣赏了他特为我们表演的精彩节目：醉鬼和催眠曲。这天夜晚，我们像是回到了自己的家里。
    苏联共产党和政府的领导人伏罗希洛夫等同志看了我们的演出，他们招待了我们，并赠给我们鲜花，伏罗希洛夫同志说：“你们的艺术不仅表现了人民的痛苦，像‘化蝶’一场，还表现了人民的意志和力量。”他说完就举起手里的酒杯为毛主席的健康干杯。
    中国有句老话：“人逢佳节倍思亲”，在十月革命节三十八周年来到的时候，这种思念亲人的感情，我们是特别强烈的，这几天那些可爱的苏联朋友的形影不时在我跟前映现。记得一九五○年我到华沙参加世界和平大会，是在列车上渡过这一伟大节日的，郭沫若团长把我们全体同志邀在一起和列车上的苏联朋友们共庆这一节日。能在苏维埃国土上过节，使大家无比的激动，但人们还感到不满足的是不能在莫斯科去看敬爱的斯大林同志检阅盛大的阅兵式和游行，于是有人说：“早走几天不也就赶上莫斯科的节日了吗？”这几天剧院里的同志们和我又天真地在说：“迟走些时候，不也是参加了十月革命节吗？”
    今年的国庆节，我在祖国的首都渡过了欢乐的一天。当我站在雄伟的天安门城楼下，看到我最敬爱的父亲和领袖毛主席在“东方红”乐声中登上天安门城楼，又看见他和党、政府的领导人一起检阅着我们英雄的子弟兵、祖国建设的保卫者人民解放军和欢悦沸腾的群众队伍；我向站在观礼台上苏联文化代表团、苏联艺术家代表团的朋友们看去，他们在谈笑，在注视着那一路一路接受检阅的队伍，不时也像我们一样回过头去瞻视一下天安门城楼上的毛主席和中国共产党和政府的领导人；我也看到了来自各人民民主国家，资本主义国家的朋友，我激动得很。“和平—友谊—文化”把我们联结在一起。这时我不由地想起了红场，想到五一节或是十月革命节的欢乐景象，在天安门悠扬的军乐声中，我似乎听到克里姆林宫的钟声。当孩子们手中的汽球和白鸽飞翔在天安门上空时，我想起在苏联时所拥抱过、亲吻过的蓝眼睛、褐眼睛、黄眼睛的孩子们，他们曾经对我说过：“问中国小朋友的好！”……
    在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年的前夕，我的心又像飞到了莫斯科。我们和苏联人民是共同来欢庆我们的节日的。记得中国越剧团快要回国时，我们很自然地谈起了自己的祖国，接待我们的谢妙尼盖奇同志激动而天真地说：“你们又想念祖国了！不要谈了！好的事常常飞快地过去，你们在这里的一个多月，就像过了一天一样……”他对我们说，别“你们”“我们”的称呼，他说：
  “我们就是我们！我们——越剧团和接待团——是一个单位。”“我们”这两个字，确是包含了这深刻的含义。我在这里寄语给我那些苏联朋友：我和我的同志们时刻在你们的中间！伏罗希洛夫同志曾经叮嘱我们下次再到莫斯科时别忘了去看他们。我时刻都记忆着这句嘱咐的话语，我时刻都在他们身边！
    共同的事业和理想把我们紧紧相联，苏联共产主义的建设事业和我国社会主义的建设事业是沸腾着的，中苏两国人民的心声是相通的！
