　　Who is Obstructing the Resolution of European Security and the German Question
　　Tan Wenrui
    The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has held many discussions on the first item on the agenda—European security and the German question. Because the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France have adopted a position that does not conform to the "Geneva Spirit," the Four Foreign Ministers have so far failed to reach an appropriate agreement on this issue. The Western three countries bear full responsibility for the stagnation of the European security and German questions. However, Western foreign ministers, especially Dulles, have instead slandered the Soviet Union for undermining the instructions of the heads of the four governments, thus "greatly shattering the confidence generated at the Geneva summit," attempting to shift the responsibility for obstructing the establishment of European security and the restoration of German unity onto the Soviet Union. Such a clumsy attempt will certainly not achieve its purpose.
    Anyone who pays attention to the progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference can see how much effort the Soviet Union has made to seek convergence of views among all parties. In the process of discussing European security and the German question, the Soviet delegation successively put forward proposals on the basic principles of an all-European treaty on European collective security, proposals for concluding a European security treaty and establishing zones for the limitation and inspection of armaments in Europe, and, in accordance with the principle of promoting the reunification of Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis, put forward four proposals for the establishment of an all-German committee. Even at the ninth meeting on November 9, the Soviet delegation was making its best efforts to seek agreement, proposing to reduce the four countries' troops stationed in Germany by 50 percent and to sign a treaty between the existing national groups in Europe. The purpose of these Soviet proposals was to promote the resolution of the fundamental issue of European security, and at the same time to open the way for the restoration of German unity. All of this fully demonstrates that the Soviet Union is acting in the "Geneva Spirit" and sincerely wants to resolve the issues of European security and Germany.
    The Soviet Union holds such a firm position on European security and the German question: guaranteeing European security is the most urgent international issue, and a European collective security system must be established through the efforts of all European countries; at the same time, German unity should be restored in accordance with the interests of European security and the national interests of the German people, and the reunification of Germany is primarily a matter for the German people. The Soviet Union, taking into account the existing military blocs and agreements in Europe and the obligations undertaken by certain countries under these agreements, advocates that European collective security be implemented in two stages. In the first stage, a European security treaty should first be concluded by a relatively limited number of countries, and then a pan-European collective security system should be gradually realized. On the other hand, the Soviet Union, taking into account the actual situation that there are currently two Germanys with different social systems, and especially the obstacles to the restoration of German unity caused by the implementation of the Paris Accords, also believes that only by establishing a European collective security system can these obstacles be removed. Therefore, the Soviet Union advocates establishing a European security system in which the two Germanys that currently exist participate together, and gradually abolishing the existing military blocs, in order to create favorable conditions for resolving the German question. With such a prerequisite, it is possible to rely on the efforts of the German people themselves to achieve German unity, and the four major powers, which bear the primary responsibility for the German question, should do their best to promote the rapprochement and cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Therefore, the Soviet proposal is undoubtedly the most realistic path to resolving the European security and German questions.
    The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France have adopted a completely opposite position on this issue. From the very beginning, they have avoided the fundamental issue of consolidating European security, refused to establish a European collective security system, and insisted on using their so-called "restoration of German unity and security" plan to merge eastern Germany into West Germany, and also to make the unified Germany participate in the North Atlantic Group and the Western European Union. The Western countries' proposal to hold all-German elections is for this purpose. They even want the Soviet Union to accept their proposal as a prerequisite for resolving the European security issue. This approach by the Western countries can only make people think that they do not want to consolidate European security or restore German unity.
    It is clear that the Western countries are attempting to obstruct the real resolution of the German question, but they are trying their best to pretend to be concerned about the restoration of German unity, insisting that the Soviet Union is unwilling to reunify Germany. May I ask, who is it that does not want to reunify Germany? As everyone knows, the main obstacle currently hindering the restoration of German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis is that West Germany has begun to remilitarize and has joined the Western military bloc. To mechanically merge such a West Germany with the German Democratic Republic, which is developing on the road of peace and democracy, is obviously unrealistic and impossible. However, the Western countries not only insist on refusing to abolish the military blocs including West Germany, but also want to incorporate the unified Germany into these military blocs. Does this have anything in common with the sincere desire to unify Germany? Everyone knows that it is impossible to achieve German unity without considering the will of the German people and through the efforts of the German people themselves. However, the Western countries refuse to accept the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German committee, and even reject the Soviet Union's proposal and oppose allowing the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference on the German question. What does this have in common with the sincere desire to unify Germany?
    Even more ridiculous is that, in order to justify their untenable position, the foreign ministers of the Western three countries groundlessly slander the Soviet Union's proposals for resolving European security and the German question as violating the instructions of the heads of the four governments. But everyone can clearly see that it is not the Soviet Union that is violating the instructions of the heads of the four governments, but precisely the foreign ministers of the Western three countries. The instructions of the heads of the four governments clearly state that the issue of European security should be given the first priority, and the German question should be subordinate to the fundamental issue of European security. However, the foreign ministers of the Western three countries have placed the German question in the first place and downgraded the European issue to a secondary issue, attempting to narrow the European security and German questions to the issue of all-German elections. The heads of the four governments clearly instructed that "the resolution of the German question and the work of reunifying Germany through free elections should be carried out in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security." However, the Western countries' so-called "restoration of German unity and security" plan completely disregards the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. According to the Western countries' "plan," it is to make not only half of Germany but the entire Germany embark on the road of remilitarization, and to make not only half of Germany but the entire Germany become a breeding ground for new wars in Europe. This is clearly not in line with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. Under such a premise, the so-called holding of free elections is nothing more than imposing a militarist regime on the entire German people through the form of all-German elections. The German people and the people of European countries who have learned from history will never approve of such a German unification achieved at the expense of the national interests of Germany and the interests of European security.
    The foreign ministers of the Western three countries unreasonably rejected the Soviet Union's proposal to establish an all-German committee. They attempted to prove that the German Democratic Republic seemed not to exist, so there was no need for any all-German understanding at all. But the Western countries' position of disregarding reality is obviously extremely absurd. As Soviet Premier Bulganin once pointed out: "The international prestige of the German Democratic Republic is growing year by year. Talk of 'non-recognition' of the German Democratic Republic cannot stop this. ... Whether some people like it or not, it will continue to be consolidated in the future." The Western countries want to use the absurd argument of not recognizing the existence of the German Democratic Republic to cover up their attempt to obstruct the rapprochement and cooperation between the two parts of Germany, which is enough to show that they are unwilling to solve the German question realistically.
    It is very clear that the Western countries are一心 to create a deadlock on the issue of German unity, and use this deadlock to block the road to guaranteeing European security. Before the opening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Western propaganda machine revealed that the Western countries would use the so-called "Soviet Union's refusal to 'unify' Germany" to make the Foreign Ministers Conference achieve nothing on the issue of European security and Germany. It has now been proven that this statement is not without basis.
    However, the people of all countries do not allow the Foreign Ministers Conference to put aside the issue of European security without reaching any agreement. People particularly note that even the foreign ministers of the Western countries believe that opinions on the issue of guaranteeing European security have become closer, so the people of all countries have more reason to demand that the Four Foreign Ministers continue to work in the "Geneva Spirit" to reach an agreement on the issue of European security, which would create favorable conditions for resolving the German question. Anyone who attempts to play tricks to obstruct the establishment of European security will not be able to deceive the eyes and ears of the people of the world.

　　谁阻挠解决欧洲安全和德国问题
　　谭文瑞
    四国外长会议已对第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题进行了多次的讨论。由于美、英、法三国外长采取了一种不符合“日内瓦精神”的立场，四国外长迄今未能在这个问题上达成适当的协议。欧洲安全和德国问题的搁浅，西方三国应负完全的责任。但是西方外长特别是杜勒斯却反而诬赖苏联破坏四国政府首脑的指示，因而“大大地打破了日内瓦最高级会议时所产生的那种信心”，企图把阻挠建立欧洲安全和恢复德国统一的责任推到苏联的身上。这样一种拙劣的图谋当然是达不到目的的。
    每一个注意外长会议进程的人，都可以看得见苏联进行了多大的努力来谋求各方观点的接近。在讨论欧洲安全和德国问题的过程中，苏联代表团先后提出了关于欧洲集体安全的全欧条约的基本原则的建议、缔结欧洲安全条约和在欧洲建立限制和视察军备地区的建议，并且本着促使德国在和平民主的基础上恢复统一的原则提出了关于建立全德委员会的四点建议，甚至在十一月九日的第九次会议上，苏联代表团还在尽最大的努力来谋求协议，提出裁减四国驻德军队百分之五十和签订一项欧洲现有的国家集团之间的条约的建议。苏联这些建议的目的都是为了促成欧洲安全这个根本问题的解决，同时也是为了打开恢复德国统一的道路。所有这一切都充分表明苏联本着“日内瓦精神”行事，真心诚意要解决欧洲安全和德国问题。
    苏联在欧洲安全和德国问题上抱着这样一种坚定不移的立场，即：保障欧洲安全是最迫切的国际问题，必须通过欧洲所有国家的努力来建立欧洲的集体安全体系；同时应当按照欧洲安全的利益和德国人民的民族利益恢复德国的统一，而重新统一德国首先是德国人民的事情。苏联考虑到欧洲现有的军事集团和协定以及某些国家根据这些协定承担了义务，主张欧洲集体安全分两个阶段实行，在第一个阶段中首先由比较有限的国家来缔结一项欧洲安全条约，然后逐步实现建立全欧的集体安全体系。另一方面，苏联由于考虑到目前存在着两个社会制度不同的德国的实际情况，特别是由于巴黎协定的实施而给恢复德国统一造成的障碍，也认为只有通过建立欧洲集体安全体系才能扫除这种障碍。因此苏联主张建立一个由目前存在的两个德国一同参加的欧洲安全体系，逐步取消现有的军事集团，以创造解决德国问题的有利条件。有了这样的前提，就可以依靠德国人民自己的努力来实现德国的统一，而对德国问题负有主要责任的四大国，就应该尽力促成德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国之间的接近和合作。所以苏联的建议无疑是解决欧洲安全和德国问题最现实的道路。
    美、英、法三国外长在这个问题上却采取了一种完全相反的立场。他们一开始就回避巩固欧洲安全的根本问题，拒绝建立欧洲集体安全体系，而主张要按照他们的所谓“恢复德国统一和安全”计划，来把德国的东部合并到西德去，而且还要使统一后的德国参加北大西洋集团和西欧联盟。西方国家提出举行全德选举的建议，也就是为了这样的目的。他们甚至要苏联接受它们的建议作为解决欧洲安全问题的先决条件。西方国家这种做法，只能使人认为它们既不想巩固欧洲安全，也不想恢复德国统一。
    明明是西方国家企图阻挠德国问题的真正解决，它们却竭力装出关心恢复德国统一的样子，硬说是苏联不愿意重新统一德国。试问究竟是谁不想使德国恢复统一呢？大家知道，目前阻碍着德国在和平民主基础上恢复统一的主要障碍，就是西德已开始重新军国主义化和参加了西方军事集团。要想把这样的一个西德和在和平民主道路上发展的德意志民主共和国机械地合并起来，显然是不现实和不可能的。但是西方国家却不仅坚持不肯取消包括西德在内的军事集团，而且还要把统一后的德国纳入这些军事集团之中，这难道同统一德国的真诚愿望有任何相同之处吗？谁都知道，不考虑德国人民的意志，不通过德国人民自己的努力，要实现德国的统一是不可能的。但是西方国家却不肯接受苏联关于建立全德委员会的建议，甚至拒绝苏联的主张，反对让德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国参加外长会议关于德国问题的讨论。这同统一德国的真诚愿望又有什么相同之处呢？
    更可笑的是，西方三国外长为了要给自己站不住脚的立场辩解，毫无根据地诬蔑苏联为解决欧洲安全和德国问题而提出的建议违反四国政府首脑的指示。但是人人都能清楚地看出，违反四国政府首脑指示的不是苏联，而恰恰是西方三国的外长。四国政府首脑的指示明明是把欧洲安全的问题列为第一位，德国问题应当是从属于欧洲安全这个根本性的问题的。而西方三国外长却把德国问题放在第一位，而把欧洲问题降为次要问题，企图把欧洲安全和德国问题缩小成为全德选举问题。四国政府首脑明明指示说：“德国问题的解决和通过自由选举重新统一德国的工作应该在符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下进行”。而西方国家的所谓“恢复德国统一和安全”计划却把德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全利益完全置之不顾。根据西方国家的“计划”，就是要使不仅半个德国而且整个德国走上重新军国主义化的道路，要使不仅半个德国而且整个德国变成欧洲新战争的温床。这同德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益都显然是不相符合的。在这样的前提下，所谓举行自由选举，也不过是要通过全德选举的形式把一个军国主义的政权强加在全体德国人民的头上罢了。接受过历史教训的德国人民和欧洲各国的人民，都绝对不会赞成这样一种牺牲德国民族利益和欧洲安全利益来实现的德国统一的。
    西方三国外长无理地拒绝了苏联关于建立全德委员会的建议。他们企图证明德意志民主共和国仿佛是并不存在的，因此根本不必要有什么全德的谅解。但是西方国家这样一种不顾现实的立场显然是极端荒谬的。正如苏联布尔加宁总理所曾指出的：“德意志民主共和国的国际威信在一年年增长。关于‘不承认’德意志民主共和国的言论并不能阻挡这一点。……不管某些人喜欢或是不喜欢，今后它仍将日益巩固。”西方国家想用不承认德意志民主共和国的存在这样一种荒谬论调来掩盖它们阻挠德国两部分接近和合作的图谋，适足以说明它们不愿意实事求是地解决德国问题。
    事情很明白，西方国家一心要在德国统一问题上制造僵局，而利用这个僵局来堵塞保障欧洲安全的道路。在四国外长会议开幕以前，西方宣传机器就透露说，西方国家要利用什么“苏联对‘统一’德国的拒绝”来使外长会议在欧洲安全和德国问题上无所成就。现在证明，这种说法不是没有根据的。
    但是，各国人民不容许外长会议未取得任何协议就把欧洲安全问题搁置下来。人们特别注意到，就是西方国家的外长们也认为大家在保障欧洲安全问题上的意见已趋接近，因此各国人民更有理由要求四国外长本着“日内瓦精神”，继续努力就欧洲安全问题达成协议，这样也就能够为解决德国问题创造有利的条件。任何人企图玩弄花样来阻挠建立欧洲安全，都是骗不过世界人民的耳目的。
