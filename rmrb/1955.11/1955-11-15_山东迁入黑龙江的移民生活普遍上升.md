　　Immigrants from Shandong to Heilongjiang Experience Universal Improvement in Living Standards
    This spring, more than 10,000 impoverished farming households who moved from Liangshan, Laiyang, and other counties in Shandong Province to Heilongjiang Province have universally increased their grain production and income this year after a year of hard work, and their living standards have rapidly risen. According to a survey and statistics from twelve villages in the third district of Qing'an County, 75.8% of the immigrants have caught up with the living standards of local farmers.
    The main reason for the rapid rise in the living standards of immigrants is their participation in agricultural producers' cooperatives. According to provincial statistics, more than 90% of the immigrants have joined agricultural producers' cooperatives. When the immigrants first arrived, they did not understand the local agricultural production techniques. Many agricultural cooperatives set up specialists to guide them in learning the techniques. Some cooperatives also established a system of mutual teaching and learning between new and old members, enabling them to master the local agricultural production techniques in a short period of time and increasing their enthusiasm for production. Zhou Jipu, an immigrant from Xiangyang Village in the fourteenth district of Nehe County, and his wife worked 190 labor days. After deducting investments, agricultural taxes, public accumulation funds, etc., they also received 27 *shi* of grain. All six members of their family had new cotton clothes made, added new cotton quilts and furniture, and also raised two large, fat pigs. The elderly couple Xu Guozhi, who are both over sixty years old, also worked 40 labor days this year and received more than six *shi* of grain, which is enough for them to eat.
    Because they joined the agricultural producers' cooperatives, received a lot of grain, and had a guarantee of life, the thoughts of some immigrants who were not at ease with production and attempted to return home have been completely eliminated. When the immigrant Gao Deping first came, he was worried that he would not be accustomed to the climate and soil, and his emotions were not very stable. After the autumn harvest, he received 21 *shi* of grain. He happily said, "This Great Northern Wilderness is really a granary! I don't want to go back to Guannei anymore." (Liu Xiwen)

　　山东迁入黑龙江的移民生活普遍上升
    今春从山东省梁山、莱阳等县移到黑龙江省的一万多户贫困农民，经过一年来的辛勤劳动，今年普遍多打了粮食，增加了收入，生活水平迅速上升。据庆安县三区十二个村的调查统计，有百分之七十五点八的移民，赶上了当地农民生活水平。
    移民生活水平迅速上升的主要原因是由于参加了农业生产合作社。据全省统计，有百分之九十以上的移民，参加了农业生产合作社。移民刚来时不懂得当地农业生产技术，很多农业社设置了专人指导他们学习技术，有些社还订立了新老社员互教互学制度，使他们在短时期内就掌握了当地农业生产技术，提高了他们的生产积极性。讷河县十四区向阳村的移民周继普，夫妇俩做了一百九十个劳动日，除去投资、农业税、公积金等，还分到了二十七石粮食，一家六口都做了新棉衣，添置了新棉被和家具，还养了两头大肥猪。移民徐国志老俩口已六十多岁了，今年也做了四十个劳动日，分得了六石多粮食，足够他们食用。
    由于加入了农业生产合作社，分到很多粮食，生活有了保障，有些移民不安心生产，企图回家的思想已全部消除。移民高德平初来时担心气候、水土不习惯，情绪不大安定，秋收后，分到二十一石粮食，他高兴地说：“这北大荒真是粮仓啊！我再也不想回关里了。”　（刘喜文）
