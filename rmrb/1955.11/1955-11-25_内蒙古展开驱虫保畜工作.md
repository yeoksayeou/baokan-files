Inner Mongolia Launches Deworming Campaign to Protect Livestock

To ensure the safe overwintering of livestock, farmers and herdsmen in various parts of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have launched a large-scale deworming campaign for livestock, in conjunction with preparations for livestock to survive the winter.

Before liberation, internal parasite diseases were extremely serious in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; large numbers of livestock often died each year due to parasite diseases. After liberation, with the development of animal husbandry production and the continuous improvement of livestock feeding and management conditions, livestock parasite diseases have been reduced year by year. However, local farmers and herdsmen were accustomed to deworming livestock in the spring; at this time, livestock have just suffered from the severe winter and have weak resistance, making them prone to death and abortion due to medication. This year, in late autumn and early winter, the Department of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region carried out drug drenching deworming work while livestock were plump and fleshy. In the deworming work in various parts of the Yikezhao League, the method of simultaneously administering carbon tetrachloride and copper sulfate was trialed, so that each sheep only required two cents of medicine cost, which was widely welcomed by farmers and herdsmen.

At present, the large-scale deworming work in the region has entered a tense stage; some areas have already successfully concluded, and other areas are expected to be basically completed before and after winter. This will create favorable conditions for livestock to safely overwinter and overspring. (This newspaper’s collective correspondent and Inner Mongolia Daily Editorial Department)

　　内蒙古展开驱虫保畜工作
    内蒙古自治区各地农、牧民，为了保护牲畜安全过冬，结合各项牲畜过冬准备，展开了大规模的驱除牲畜体内寄生虫工作。
    解放前，内蒙古自治区牲畜内寄生虫病十分严重；每年常有大批牲畜因寄生虫病死亡。解放后，随着畜牧业生产的发展，牲畜饲养管理条件的不断改善，牲畜寄生虫病已逐年减少。但当地农牧民对牲畜的驱虫工作，习惯在春季进行；这时由于牲畜刚受严冬摧残，抵抗力较弱，容易因服药而发生死亡与流产。今年内蒙古自治区农牧厅在秋末冬初时，趁牲畜膘满肉肥时，即进行了药物灌治驱虫工作。伊克昭盟各地在驱虫工作中，试行了四氯化碳及硫酸铜同时投药的方法，使每只羊只要二分钱的药费，受到了农、牧民的普遍欢迎。
    目前，全区大规模的驱虫工作已进入紧张阶段；部分地区业已胜利结束，其他各地预计可在入冬前后基本完成。将给牲畜安全过冬过春创造有利条件。　（本报集体通讯员内蒙古日报编辑部）
