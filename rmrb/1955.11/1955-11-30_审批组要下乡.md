Title: Approval Teams Should Go to the Countryside

Agricultural producers' cooperatives are being established in large numbers, awaiting approval from higher authorities. However, some Party organizations are handling the approval procedures behind closed doors, which is not only slow but also creates many problems. The main basis for this approval method is the new cooperative's charter. Some charters may seem fine on the surface, but they are actually copied from other cooperatives and are thus approved. Some new cooperatives meet all the conditions, but because of low literacy levels, their charters are incomplete and therefore not approved. This phenomenon once occurred in Fengrun County, Hebei Province.

The Fengrun County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party immediately changed the practice of closed-door approval. It selected some cadres, trained them, and sent them to various districts to form approval teams in coordination with the district committees. The entire district was then divided into several zones, with an approval station established in each zone. The approval team would rotate to each station on a scheduled basis for approvals. The main responsible cadres of the townships and the directors of old cooperatives were required to participate in the approval process, along with the key members of the cooperative framework, for the purpose of learning. Small problems were solved on the spot, while larger problems were assigned to township cadres and old cooperative directors to help solve. For even larger problems, the approval team would go deep into the cooperatives to help resolve them. This approach not only speeds up the process but also ensures the quality of the cooperatives, while also providing extensive education to the new cooperatives and their frameworks.

The new situation of the cooperative movement demands that we constantly create new methods in all aspects of our work. Only in this way can we ensure that we are at the forefront of the movement and avoid falling behind.

    审批组要下乡
    农业生产合作社正在大批大批地建立起来，等待上级批准。可是，有些党组织却关起门来办理批准手续，不仅速度慢，而且问题多。因为这种审批办法的主要根据就是新社的社章，有的社章看起来没有问题，但是实际上是从别的社抄来的，结果也被批准了；有的新社各方面都够条件，就是由于文化低，社章写得不完备，反而得不到批准。河北省丰润县就曾经发生过这种现象。
    中共丰润县委立即改变了关门审批的作法，抽调了部分干部，加以训练，派到各区，协同区委组成审批组。再把全区划成几个片，每片建立审批站，这个审批组就规定日期，轮流到站审批。并且要乡的主要负责干部和老社主任一起参加审批，同时还让社架子的骨干参加，以便学习。小问题当场解决，较大的问题责成乡干部和老社主任帮助解决，更大的问题即由审批组深入到社帮助解决。这样做不但速度快，而且可以保证社的质量，同时对新建社和社架子都有广泛的教育作用。
    合作化运动的新形势，要求我们在工作的各个环节上不断创造新方法。这样才能保证走到运动的前头，避免落在运动的后头。
