Xinhua News Agency Dispatch:

    The Soviet Union is preparing to further broadly expand scientific research work in the Arctic.

    The Director of the Soviet Northern Sea Route Administration, Bukhanov, recently told a TASS reporter that comprehensive surveys in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions are a complete and independent part of the International Geophysical Year program. The Soviet Union, with thousands of kilometers of its northern border in the Arctic region, will actively participate in this survey work. Soviet scientific institutions are making thorough preparations for this. According to the plan, the survey work will be carried out by more than a hundred fixed observation stations, including a number of new stations that will be established. The Arctic Scientific Research Institute’s five observation stations located between 70 and 81 degrees north latitude, and the "North Pole-4," "North Pole-5," and the "North Pole-6" drifting ice scientific stations which will be established, will all participate in this work.

    Various mobile teams of scientists will explore the vast seas of the Arctic Ocean. It is expected that these teams, transported by aircraft, will conduct observations in more than five hundred locations.

    Bukhanov said: Relying on this widely distributed network composed of fixed observation stations and mobile survey teams, Soviet scientists intend to implement an extensive scientific observation program to further study the Arctic situation, especially to explore blank spots in the Arctic seabed topography, determine the paths of ocean currents and the direction of ice drift, thereby ensuring the safety of navigation along the Arctic sea route.

    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow: The staff of the Soviet "North Pole-4" drifting ice scientific station have been working for a full seven months since taking over the work shift. During this period, the position of the ice floe where the scientific station is located has moved 570 kilometers directly north, and drifted more than 1,400 kilometers in a curve. It is approaching the starting point of the "North Pole-3" drifting ice scientific station last year. This means that in the dozen years since the establishment of the "North Pole-1" scientific station in 1937, the drifting routes of the five scientific stations established by the Soviet Union one after another have been connected into a line, traversing the entire Arctic from the Bering Strait to the Greenland Sea. This line connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The scientific materials collected in this area have been used to predict weather, determine the condition of ice along the Arctic route, and to solve some scientific problems of great significance to the Soviet national economy. Now, the Arctic region is in the pitch-black Arctic night, often with storms, heavy snow, and cold air. But these have not affected the work of the scientific station.

### 苏联准备进一步展开北极科学考察工作

    苏联准备进一步展开北极科学考察工作
    据新华社讯　苏联正在准备进一步广泛展开对北极的科学考察工作。
    苏联北海海运管理局局长布哈诺夫最近对塔斯社记者说，在北极地区和亚北极地区进行综合考察，是国际地球物理学年计划中一个完整的独立部分。北部边境有几千公里在北极地区的苏联，将积极参加这一考察工作。苏联的科学机关正在为此进行周密的准备。根据计划，考察工作将由一百多个固定的考察站进行，其中包括一批将建立起来的新站。北极科学研究所在北纬七十度到八十一度内的五个观察站和“北极—四号”、“北极—五号”以及将建立的“北极—六号”浮冰科学站都将参加这一工作。
    科学家组成的各个流动小组将探测北极海的广阔海面。预计，这些由飞机运送的小组将在五百多个地方进行观测。
    布哈诺夫说：依靠这种由固定的考察站和流动的考察小组组成的广泛分布网，苏联科学家们打算执行一个广泛的科学观测计划，进一步研究北极情况，特别是探测北极海底地形的空白点，确定大洋水流的道路和冰的飘流方向，从而保证极北海道沿途的航行安全。
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联“北极四号”浮冰科学站的工作人员自从接替工作班时候起已经整整七个月了。在这段期间，科学站所在的冰块的位置直线向北移了五百七十公里，而曲线漂浮了一千四百多公里。它已接近去年“北极三号”浮冰科学站的起点。这就是说，自从一九三七年建立“北极一号”科学站以来的十几年中，苏联先后建立的五个科学站的漂浮路线已连成一线，从白令海峡到格陵兰海，横贯整个北极。这条线联结了大西洋和太平洋。在这一带地区收集的科学材料已被用来预测天气，测定冰在北极航线上的状况，并且被用来解决一些对苏联国民经济有重大意义的科学问题。现在，北极地区是漆黑的北极夜，常常有暴风、大雪、寒气。但是这些并没有影响科学站的工作。
