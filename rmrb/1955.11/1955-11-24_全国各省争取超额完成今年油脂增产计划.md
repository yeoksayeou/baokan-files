Provinces Across the Country Strive to Exceed This Year's Oil Production Increase Plan

　　(Our report) Provinces across the country are striving to exceed this year's oil production increase plan. As of the end of the third quarter, according to incomplete statistics from nine provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Anhui, Sichuan, Rehe, and Shanghai, the edible oil production has increased by more than 31,990 tons. Among them, Shanghai increased its production by more than 7,760 tons, accounting for more than 388% of the original production increase plan. Currently, Shanghai oil factories have decided to increase production by another 2,939 tons in the fourth quarter. Twenty-one state-owned and joint state-private oil factories in Jiangsu Province have exceeded the third quarter oil production plan by 116.87%, increasing the edible oil production by 7,399 tons; by the end of this year, they will complete and exceed the annual target of increasing oil production by 10,000 tons. Heilongjiang Province increased its oil production by 4,362 tons from January to September. In the fourth quarter, the province plans to increase the oil extraction rate of hot-pressed soybeans to 13.31% and cold-pressed soybeans to 11.1%, which will increase edible oil production by another 2,507 tons. Shanxi Province requires a further increase of 1,379.7 tons of oil in the fourth quarter, which will complete 113.93% of the annual production increase plan.
    In order to improve the oil extraction rate, various provinces and cities have widely promoted various advanced experiences, especially the Li Chuanjiang oil extraction operation method. Shanghai oil factories have increased edible oil production by more than 1,580 tons due to the improved oil extraction rate. The oil extraction rate of soybeans in Jiangsu Province oil factories has increased most significantly. In January of this year, only 11.77 catties of oil could be extracted, but by September it had generally risen to 13.77 catties. Various provinces are also promoting the experience of "thin, grass-free cake rings."
    Opening up new oil sources has also played a very important role in increasing edible oil production. Provinces are generally using "cold-pressed soybeans to copy tofu," "hot-pressed soybeans to copy soy sauce," "rice bran oil extraction," and other wild oil materials to increase oil production.

　　全国各省争取超额完成今年油脂增产计划
    本报讯　全国各省正在争取超额完成今年油脂增产计划。截至第三季度末，据江苏、山西、黑龙江、河南、湖南、安徽、四川、热河和上海九个省市的不完全统计，已增产食油三万一千九百九十多吨。其中上海共增产七千七百六十多吨，占原增产计划的百分之三百八十八以上。目前，上海各油厂又决定在第四季度内再增产二千九百三十九吨。江苏省地方国营、公私合营的二十一个油厂，已超额完成第三季度产油计划的百分之一百一十六点八七，增产了七千三百九十九吨食油；到今年年底，将要完成和超额完成全年增产一万吨食油的任务。黑龙江省从一月到九月期间，共增产油四千三百六十二吨。在第四季度内，全省准备把热榨大豆的出油率提高到百分之十三点三一，冷榨提高到百分之十一点一，这样，就可再增产食油二千五百零七吨。山西省要求在第四季度内再增产油一千三百七十九点七吨，这样就可以完成全年增产计划的百分之一百十三点九三。
    为了提高出油率，各省市普遍地推广了各种先进经验，特别是李川江榨油操作法。上海市各油厂由于提高了出油率而增产了一千五百八十多吨食油。江苏省各油厂大豆的出油率上升最显著，在今年一月，只能出油十一点七七斤，到九月已普遍上升到十三点七七斤。各省还正在推广“薄型无草饼圈”经验。
    开辟新油源也对食油增产起了非常重大的作用。各省正普遍运用“冷榨大豆复制豆腐”、“热榨大豆复制酱油”、“米糠榨油”以及其它野生油料来增产油脂。
