Overseas Chinese in Fujian Invest in and Establish Enterprises

Over the past six years, Overseas Chinese in Fujian have established dozens of enterprises.

These factories include the joint state-private owned Quanzhou Sugar Factory, Tong'an Oil Factory, Fuqing Oil Factory and its affiliated power plant, Putian Power Plant, and four rosin factories in Nanping, Dehua, Yongtai, and Wuping. In addition, Overseas Chinese have solely invested in the Longyan Paper Mill (which became a joint state-private enterprise in 1953) and the Gutian Overseas Chinese Iron Smelting Plant. After the Gutian Overseas Chinese Iron Smelting Plant signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative last year and received a payment of 4,000 yuan, the number of smelting furnaces increased from two to four, with a daily output of 2,000 jin of pig iron, which is sold by the cooperative to the rural areas of Nanping, Yong'an, and Jianyang prefectures.

The broad masses of Overseas Chinese have also vigorously invested in the development of the mountainous economy of Fujian Province. On Dongbao Mountain in Longyan, there is an Overseas Chinese reclamation farm with fruit trees covering the mountains and pigs in flocks; on Menghu Mountain in Yongchun, there is the Penglai Overseas Chinese Reclamation and Planting Farm with a combination of fruit and animal husbandry; in Shuitou and Banqiao in Tong'an, there are the New Overseas Chinese Pasture and Reclamation Farm; in Taiwu Mountain in Zhangpu, there is the Gutai Reclamation Farm, mainly engaged in animal husbandry; in addition, there are the Huangbang Mountain Overseas Chinese Reclamation Farm in Longyan, the Yongchun Huaxing Plantation Company Tea Farm, the Yongchun Beikong Overseas Chinese Reclamation Farm, and the Tajia Township Tea Farm in Nanjing. Since these agricultural and pastoral farms were established, production has been expanding daily.

At the end of 1954, Overseas Chinese in Xiamen also established the Overseas Chinese Breeding Farm (now a joint state-private enterprise), with a total area of more than 55,000 mu available for shellfish breeding. This year, a trial breeding of razor clams has been carried out on 50 mu.

Currently, the Fujian Investment Company plans to build the Longyan Power Plant, the Longyan Iron Plant, a large sugar factory, and four rosin factories; enterprises being planned and funded solely or jointly by Overseas Chinese include: the joint state-private Longxi Overseas Chinese Farm, the Tajia Township Livestock Farm in Nanjing County, the Zhangshanxia Overseas Chinese Reclamation Farm in Yongding County, the Fotan Overseas Chinese Farm in Zhangpu County, and the Gaotou Tea Farm and the Daxi Reclamation and Planting Farm in Yongding County.

    福建华侨投资兴办企业
    六年来，福建华侨共兴办了数十个企业。
    这些工厂包括有公私合营泉州糖厂、同安油厂、福清油厂及其附设电厂，莆田电厂和南平、德化、永泰、武平等四座松香厂。另外，华侨还独资兴办了龙岩造纸厂（已于一九五三年公私合营）和古田华侨炼铁厂。古田华侨炼铁厂去年和供销合作社订立合同，得到四千元的货款后，炼铁炉由两座增到四座，日产生铁两千斤，由合作社代为推销到南平、永安和建阳专区的农村中去。
    广大华侨还大力投资开发福建省山区经济。在龙岩东宝山，出现了果树满山、猪只成群的华侨垦牧场；在永春猛虎山，出现了果、牧并重的蓬莱华侨垦植场；在同安水头、板桥，出现了新侨牧场和垦业农场；在漳浦太武山，出现了以畜牧为主的古台垦牧场；此外还有龙岩黄邦山华侨垦牧场、永春华兴种植公司茶场、永春北硿华侨垦牧场、南靖塔下乡茶场。这些农牧场开办以来，生产日益扩展。
    一九五四年底，厦门华侨还创办了华侨养殖场（已改为公私合营），全场可供养殖贝类的面积有五万五千多亩，今年已试养殖蛏五十亩。
    目前，福建投资公司计划再建龙岩电厂、龙岩铁厂和一个大糖厂、四个松香厂；华侨独资或合股筹办中的企业有：公私合营龙溪华侨农场，南靖县塔下乡畜牧场，永定县掌山下华侨垦牧场、漳浦县佛昙华侨农场、永定县高头茶场和大溪垦植场等。
