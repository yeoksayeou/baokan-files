To the Editor:

The autumn plowing work in Songzhuang Village, Ooze Township, Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, is very poor. Of the village's 2,193 mu of autumn land, only about 200 mu have been plowed. The village's Party Branch Secretary, Gao Jintang, and cooperative director, Zhang Yucheng, do not understand the overall situation of autumn plowing in the village and carelessly say "autumn plowing is not a problem." The leaders of the agricultural production cooperatives have abandoned autumn plowing and are only focusing on sideline occupations. Many new farmers who have signed up to join the cooperatives believe that plowing the land is now the cooperative's business. Some only care about tidying up trivial matters at home, while others engage in sideline occupations.

Why has the autumn plowing work in this village fallen into a state of laissez-faire? The reason is that the village cadres mistakenly oppose the two tasks of establishing cooperatives and production. They believe: building cooperatives is very busy, so we cannot take care of autumn plowing. Some people even seem to have a good reason to say: "If we were not busy building cooperatives, autumn plowing would not be a problem, and it could be plowed once over in three or five days."

This practice of only focusing on building cooperatives and neglecting production will seriously damage production, and the agricultural production cooperatives will certainly not be well-run. The Tunliu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party should educate the cadres of Songzhuang Village to understand the principle that building cooperatives and production must be combined, recognize the great significance of doing a good job in autumn plowing to ensure increased agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives next year, and correct the erroneous thinking of neglecting autumn plowing and the single-handed approach. The village cadres of Songzhuang Village should immediately organize the masses to launch a crash autumn plowing campaign to ensure that all autumn land is plowed once over.

### 宋庄村只管建社放松秋耕

　  宋庄村只管建社放松秋耕编辑同志：
    山西屯留县藕泽乡宋庄村的秋耕工作搞得很不好。全村二千一百九十三亩秋地，还只耕了二百来亩。村里的党支书高金堂和社主任张玉成对于全村的秋耕情况都不了解，还满不在意地说“秋耕不成问题”。农业生产合作社的领导人员放下秋耕工作不管，却去专门搞副业。不少新报名入社的农民认为耕地已经是社里的事了，有的就只顾拾掇家里的琐碎杂事，有的搞副业。
    为什么这个村的秋耕工作会陷于自流状态呢？原来是村干部们错误地把办社和生产两件工作对立起来了。他们认为：建社很忙，那顾得上秋耕地。有些人还似乎很有理由地说：“如果不是忙建社，秋耕是不成问题的，三、五天就能普耕一遍。”
    这种只管建社、丢掉生产的做法，将使生产受到严重损失，而农业生产合作社也一定是办不好的。中共屯留县委应该教育宋庄村的干部懂得办社同生产必须结合起来的道理，认识做好秋耕工作对保证明年农业增产和农业社巩固的重大意义，纠正忽视秋耕的错误思想和单打一的做法。宋庄村的村干部们应该立即组织群众开展突击秋耕运动，保证将所有的秋地都耕一遍。
