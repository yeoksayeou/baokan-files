Xinhua News Agency, 24th: According to the Soviet "Komsomolskaya Pravda," Soviet scientists are conducting research on building power stations using underground thermal energy, which has high economic value. Under the leadership of scientists from the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Soviet drilling workers will soon begin drilling for two geothermal power stations. The cost of electricity generated by this type of geothermal power station is very low, 90% cheaper than thermal power stations and 75% cheaper than hydroelectric power stations.

Underground thermal energy is underground hot water and hot gas generated by atomic fission of radioactive materials deep inside the earth and other causes. Geothermal power stations can be built as long as wells are drilled in areas where underground thermal energy is relatively shallow. It requires neither fuel nor expensive boilers, nor dams, sluice gates, or other costly hydraulic枢纽 buildings. The funds used to build a geothermal power station can be fully recovered two years after the power station generates electricity.

In addition, geothermal power stations can also use underground thermal energy to supply cities and enterprises with heating. Valuable chemicals such as boron, arsenic, and bromine can also be extracted from underground hot water and hot gas.

The Soviet Union has abundant underground thermal energy. From the Kuril Islands to Siberia, from the Pamirs and Tianshan Mountains to the Caucasus, from the Far North to the Transcarpathian region, there are large amounts of readily available underground hot water and hot gas. In Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, people can obtain hot gas with a temperature of 300 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 30 atmospheres by drilling to a depth of only 200 to 500 meters.

### 苏联即将开始建立两个地热发电站

　　苏联即将开始建立两个地热发电站
    新华社二十四日讯　据苏联“共青团真理报”报道：苏联科学家正在进行利用经济价值很高的地下热能建立发电站的研究工作。在苏联科学院科学家的领导下，苏联的钻井工作人员很快就要开始为两个地热发电站钻井。这种地热发电站发出的电力的成本很低，比火力发电站要便宜百分之九十，比水力发电站要便宜百分之七十五。
    地下热能就是由地球内部深处放射性物质发生原子分裂和其他原因而产生的地下热水和热气。只要在地下热能蕴藏较浅的地方钻井，就可以建立起地热发电站。它既不需要燃料和价值很贵的锅炉，也不需要堤坝、水闸和其他很费钱的水力枢纽建筑物。在发电站发电两年以后，用于建筑地热发电站的资金就可以全部收回。
    此外，地热发电站还能够利用地下热能来供应城市和企业以暖气。地下热水和热气还可以提炼出像硼、砷、溴等贵重的化学品。
    苏联境内蕴藏着丰富的地下热能。从千岛群岛到西伯利亚，从帕米尔、天山到高加索，从极北地区到外喀尔巴阡地区，都有着大量的便于利用的地下热水和热气。在堪察加和千岛群岛，人们只要钻井到二百到五百公尺的深处，就能够获得摄氏三百度和三十个大气压的热气。
