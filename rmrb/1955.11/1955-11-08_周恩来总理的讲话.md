Respected Ambassador, Comrades, Friends:

Today is the 38th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution. On behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, I extend my heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet government and the Soviet people with extremely joyful feelings.

Over the past thirty-eight years, the great Soviet people have traversed a glorious and arduous path, achieving brilliant accomplishments in the struggle to build a communist society and safeguard world peace. The Chinese people regard every achievement of the Soviet people as their own and are encouraged and gladdened by it.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, the Soviet people used four years and four months to complete the industrial production targets of the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule at the end of April this year, further developing the national economy and improving the material and cultural living standards. These tremendous achievements of the Soviet people not only advanced the cause of communist construction but also greatly strengthened the forces of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp. These achievements have also inspired the people of the people's democratic countries engaged in socialist construction and the entire progressive humanity's confidence in defending world peace and striving for a better future.

In the past year, the Soviet government has taken a series of major measures in easing international tensions, promoting peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries, and maintaining peace in Europe and the world. These measures have had a profound impact. The Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference is currently underway, and the correct propositions and specific proposals put forward by the Soviet government delegation on European security and the German question, disarmament, and the development of contacts between East and West express the common aspirations of the people of Europe and the world. The Chinese government and the Chinese people fully agree with and support these propositions and proposals. We believe that if all participating countries have the same spirit of reconciliation and make corresponding efforts, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference should be able to achieve positive results.

On the other hand, one cannot fail to notice that in Asia, the tension in the Taiwan area still exists, the implementation of the Geneva Accords for the restoration of peace in Indochina has been obstructed, and the peaceful reunification of Korea has not yet been realized. Therefore, the serious situation in Asia also requires the countries concerned to seek solutions through consultation. The Soviet Union, India, China, and some other countries have made continuous efforts for this purpose. If all the countries concerned have the same desire and make corresponding efforts, all outstanding issues in Asia and the Far East should also be able to be resolved reasonably.

The path that the Soviet people have traversed in the past thirty-eight years is precisely the path that the Chinese people are taking today. The Soviet people have given us tremendous help while carrying out the great cause of communist construction, which is of utmost importance to the successful realization of our first Five-Year Plan. The fraternal friendship and close unity between China and the Soviet Union are a powerful factor in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world, and guarantee our peaceful construction. The Chinese people are very grateful for the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet people and will continue to work hard to consolidate and develop the great friendship between our two countries.

I propose:

	For the great Soviet people, for the strength and prosperity of the Soviet Union,
	For the Soviet Union's great contribution to the cause of safeguarding world peace,
	For the health of the leading comrades of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government,
	For the unbreakable great friendship between China and the Soviet Union,
	For world peace,
	Cheers!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

专栏：

    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的大使同志、同志们、朋友们：
    今天是伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念日，我代表中国政府和中国人民以极愉快的心情向苏联政府和苏联人民表示衷心的祝贺。
    三十八年来，伟大的苏联人民走过了光荣的艰苦的道路，在建设共产主义社会和维护世界和平的斗争中获得了光辉的成就。中国人民把苏联人民的每一个成就都看成是自己的成就，并且为此而感到欢欣鼓舞。
    苏联人民在苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导下，用了四年零四个月的时间，在今年四月底提前完成了第五个五年计划的工业生产指标，进一步发展了国民经济，提高了物质的和文化的生活水平。苏联人民所获得的这些巨大成就，不仅把共产主义建设事业向前推进了一步，而且大大地增强了和平、民主、社会主义阵营的力量。这些成就也鼓舞了正在从事社会主义建设的各人民民主国家的人民和全体进步人类保卫世界和平和争取美好未来的信心。
    一年以来，苏联政府在和缓国际紧张局势、促进各国之间的和平共处和友好合作和维护欧洲和世界和平等方面，采取了一系列的重大措施，这些措施已经产生了深远的影响。目前日内瓦四国外长会议正在进行，苏联政府代表团就欧洲安全和德国问题、裁军问题和发展东西方之间的接触问题所提出的正确主张和具体建议，表达了欧洲和世界人民的共同愿望，中国政府和中国人民完全赞成和支持这些主张和建议。我们认为：如果与会各国都抱有同样的和解精神，并且作出相应的努力，四国外长会议应该能够获得积极的结果。
    另一方面，人们不能不注意到，在亚洲，台湾地区的紧张局势仍然存在，恢复印度支那和平的日内瓦协议的执行遭到了阻挠，朝鲜的和平统一至今还没有实现。因此，亚洲的严重局势同样要求有关的国家通过协商来谋求解决。苏联、印度、中国和某些国家曾经为此目的作过不断的努力。如果一切有关国家都具有同样的愿望，并且作出相应的努力，亚洲和远东的一切悬而未决的问题也应该能够得到合理的解决。
    三十八年来苏联人民所走过的道路，正是今天中国人民所走着的道路。苏联人民在进行伟大的共产主义建设的同时，给了我们巨大的帮助，这对于我国顺利实现第一个五年计划有着极重要的意义。中苏两国的兄弟友谊和亲密团结，是维护远东和世界和平的强大因素，并且保障了我们的和平建设。中国人民十分感激伟大的苏联人民的兄弟援助，并且将继续努力来巩固和发展我们两国之间的伟大友谊。
    我提议：
    为伟大的苏联人民，为苏联的强大和繁荣，
    为苏联在维护世界和平事业中的巨大贡献，
    为苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导同志们的健康，
    为中苏两国牢不可破的伟大友谊，
    为世界和平，
    干杯！
