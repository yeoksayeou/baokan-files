How to Plan for Eliminating Rural Illiteracy
Ke Mian

Planning for the elimination of illiteracy in rural areas must be based on certain data. I believe the following information is indispensable:

	It is necessary to understand how many illiterate and semi-literate young and middle-aged people there are in the local rural areas, and to understand their requirements and conditions for learning, as well as the actual problems existing in learning. By grasping these specific situations, we can propose suitable forms of learning organization for them, determine who should adopt class teaching, who should adopt group teaching, and who still needs to adopt the method of individual tutoring.

	Understanding the situation of illiterates is only to put forward the task of eliminating illiteracy. To complete the task requires strength, which is mainly teachers. Therefore, we should understand how many literate people there are locally, what their educational level, production and living conditions, and political situation are. Among these people, how many can be organized to serve as teachers for eliminating illiteracy, and how many hours can they teach each day. With this information, we can organize forces. Those with more time can undertake class teaching, and those with less time can undertake group teaching or individual tutoring. The number of literate people in rural areas is constantly increasing. In the next few years, the number of middle school, higher primary school, and junior primary school graduates, as well as those who have emerged from illiteracy, will increase. This should be taken into account when calculating the strength of teachers.

	Farmers' literacy is carried out in their spare time, and the amount of time farmers spend learning determines the speed of eliminating illiteracy. We should conduct a detailed understanding of farmers' learning time according to the local farming season, clarifying how long the busy and slack seasons are, how long should be given off during the busy season, how many times a week can be studied during the slack season, and how many hours can be studied each time. When calculating learning time, we must consider many complex situations to prevent excessively high or low estimates. In terms of production time, farmers' learning time also varies due to different production burdens and the nature of the crops they plant, such as the difference between members of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid team members, and individual farmers, the difference between planting grain crops and planting technical crops, and the difference between young people and adults. In addition to production, farmers also need different amounts of time to handle household affairs. Some people need more time, some less, and some young people need even less. Therefore, learning time should be calculated separately for these different objects, and different requirements should be put forward for learning.

	Farmers' learning time is constantly changing. Because farmers have joined cooperatives, the unification of production time and the simplification of production burdens will increase farmers' learning time; the improvement of cooperative production management and the improvement of production technology will also increase learning time. Therefore, when studying learning time, this should also be taken into account.

	The situation of illiteracy, the strength of teachers, and learning time are the basic data for planning the elimination of illiteracy. If we clarify these situations, plus some other situations, such as the foundation of farmers' culture and education and the experience of mass education in the local area, we can make a plan for eliminating illiteracy.

	To obtain these data, we must conduct investigation and research. If a province or county can carefully select one or two (or three or four) townships and cooperatives to conduct detailed investigations, and analyze and study the materials based on the investigation, it can formulate a plan for eliminating illiteracy in the province or county. It is best to assist townships and cooperatives in formulating plans for eliminating illiteracy while conducting investigations. This approach is of great use in formulating plans for the region, as it can help to understand the situation, discover problems, gain experience, and train cadres.

	The formulation of the plan should generally be: the higher level puts forward the overall indicators and overall requirements from top to bottom, and the lower level formulates the plan from bottom to top. For example, after investigation and research, a province or county puts forward the overall indicators for eliminating illiteracy in the province or county; townships (villages) and cooperatives, according to the requirements put forward by the higher level, combined with the specific conditions of the township, village, and cooperative, formulate a plan for eliminating illiteracy within a few years and specific measures to achieve the plan. The province and county then make necessary revisions to the original plan based on the lower-level plans to make the province's and county's plans for eliminating illiteracy more in line with reality.

	Planning the elimination of rural illiteracy is a complex task and should be carried out under the direct leadership of party committees and governments at all levels. It is necessary to conduct in-depth propaganda and education for staff and the masses to make them understand the significance of eliminating illiteracy for socialist construction; it is necessary to specifically analyze the current favorable conditions and objective difficulties in eliminating illiteracy to prevent the two deviations that have occurred in the past: one is the failure to see the favorable conditions brought about by the development of the agricultural cooperation movement to the elimination of illiteracy and the importance of eliminating farmers' illiteracy, and to adopt a passive and conservative attitude towards eliminating illiteracy; the other is the failure to base on the development of the cooperation movement, to ignore objective conditions, and to put forward unrealistic demands. Only in this way can we do this work well.

　　怎样作扫除农村文盲的规划
　　苛勉
    规划农村的扫除文盲工作，必须有一定的资料做根据。我认为下面的一些资料是不可缺少的：
    要了解当地农村青壮年中有多少文盲，有多少半文盲，并了解这些人对于学习的要求和学习的条件，以及在学习中存在的实际问题。掌握了这些具体情况，就可以提出适合于他们的学习组织形式，确定哪些人采取班级教学，哪些人采取小组教学，哪些人还需要采取包教包学的办法。
    了解了文盲的情况，只是提出扫除文盲的任务，完成任务需要有力量，这主要是师资。因此，应该了解当地有多少识字的人，这些人的文化程度、生产和生活情况、政治情况如何，这些人中间有多少人可以组织他们担任扫除文盲的教师，他们每天能够教几个小时。有了这些情况，就可以组织力量，时间多的人可以担任班级教学，时间少的人可以担任小组教学或包教包学。农村识字的人在不断增加，今后几年内中学、高小和初小毕业生，以及脱离了文盲状态的人都将有所增加，在计算师资力量的时候，应该考虑到这一点。
    农民的识字是在业余进行的，农民学习时间的多少决定着扫除文盲的速度。应该根据当地的农事季节，对农民的学习时间进行详细的了解，弄清农忙季节和农闲季节各有多长时间，农忙季节应该放多长时间的假，农闲季节每周可以学几次，每次可以学习几小时。在计算学习时间的时候，要考虑到许多复杂的情况，防止偏高偏低的现象。就生产时间来说，农民由于生产负担不同，也由于所种农作物的性质不同，农民的学习时间也有所区别，如农业生产合作社的社员、互助组组员和单干农民不同，种植粮食作物的和种植技术作物的不同，青年和壮年不同。农民除生产外，处理家务事情所需要的时间也有不同，有的人要多一些，有的人少一些，有一部分青年人更少。所以，学习时间应该根据这些不同的对象分别计算，在学习上提出不同的要求。
    农民的学习时间在不断地发生变化。由于农民参加了合作社，生产时间的统一、生产负担的单纯化，农民学习的时间就会多一些；合作社生产管理的改善、生产技术的改进，也会增加学习时间。因此，在研究学习时间的时候，也应该考虑到这一点。
    文盲情况、师资力量、学习时间，是规划扫除文盲工作的基本资料。把这些情况弄清楚，再加上其他的一些情况，如当地农民文化教育的基础、群众办学的经验等，就可以作出扫除文盲的规划。
    要取得这些资料，就必须调查研究。假如一个省或一个县，能够认真选一、二个（或者三、四个）乡和合作社，作详细的调查，根据调查的材料加以分析研究，就可以制定出本省或本县的扫除文盲规划。最好在调查的同时，能够协助乡和合作社订出扫除文盲规划。这种作法对于制定本地区的规划有很大作用，它可以帮助摸清情况，发现问题，取得经验，训练干部。
    规划的制定，一般的应该是：由上而下提出总指标、总要求，由下而上地制定计划。比如一个省、一个县，经过调查研究，提出本省、本县的扫除文盲总指标；乡（村）、合作社，根据上级提出的要求，结合本乡本村本合作社的具体情况，订出几年内扫除文盲的计划和实现计划的具体办法。省、县再根据下边的规划，对原订规划加以必要的修改，使省、县的扫除文盲规划更加符合实际。
    规划扫除农村文盲的工作，是一个复杂的工作，应该在各级党委和政府的直接领导下进行。要向工作人员和群众进行深入的宣传教育，使他们懂得扫除文盲对于社会主义建设的意义；要具体地分析当前扫除文盲工作中的有利条件和客观困难，以防止过去曾经发生的两种偏向：一种是看不到农业合作化运动的发展给扫除文盲工作带来的有利条件，以及扫除农民文盲的重要性，而对扫除文盲采取消极保守的态度；一种是不根据合作化运动发展的情况，不注意客观条件，提出不切实际的要求。只有这样才能做好这项工作。
