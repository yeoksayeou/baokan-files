Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 10th: Thirty-nine business groups, including the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, jointly held a meeting in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 9th to hear the summary report on the visit to China by the Japanese business delegation headed by Masao Tajima.

Among those attending the report meeting were Shozo Murata, President of the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, Ichiro Shimamura, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of International Trade and Industry, and approximately 600 people from the business community. Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, and Xiao Xiangqian, deputy head, were also invited to attend the report meeting.

The report meeting unanimously adopted a resolution, the main content of which was to oppose the "embargo," and sent it to the Japanese government, the U.S. government, and the governments of countries related to the "Paris Committee."

The resolution to the Japanese government requested the Japanese government to support and assist the trade contracts signed by the Japanese business delegation and the Chinese import and export corporations during this visit to China, and at the same time, to take measures as soon as possible to abolish or relax the restrictions of the "Paris Committee," to sign payment agreements with China, to establish commercial representative offices in each other's countries, and to relax restrictions on entry and exit.

The resolution to the U.S. government and the governments of countries related to the "Paris Committee" stated that the Chinese people are peace-loving. China is building a new peaceful economy, and it is not in accordance with the facts to regard China as an aggressor country.

The resolution emphasized that there is no reason to continue to obstruct economic exchanges between Japan and China with the artificial "embargo" of the "Paris Committee." The resolution went on to say: We cannot help but believe that if this measure continues, it will hinder East-West exchanges and hinder world peace at the same time.

The resolution requested countries related to the "Paris Committee" to resolutely take steps to lift the "embargo" restrictions.

Many people spoke at the meeting, hoping to promote the development of Sino-Japanese trade.

Ichiro Shimamura, Parliamentary Vice-Minister of International Trade and Industry, read a speech on behalf of International Trade and Industry Minister Tanzan Ishibashi. Ishibashi said that the volume of Japan's trade with China is far below the pre-war level. The main reason is the restrictions of the "embargo." He believes that this visit to China by the Japanese business delegation has opened up new avenues for exchanges between China and Japan and laid the foundation for the development of Sino-Japanese trade in the future. He hopes that all parties concerned will work together to enable Sino-Japanese trade to achieve further development.

Masao Tajima, head of the Japanese business delegation to China, gave a detailed report on the specific content of the agreements they reached with the Chinese side in Beijing. He emphasized that as long as the restrictions of the "Paris Committee" are lifted, trade between China and Japan can be carried out without hindrance. He also emphasized the need to resolve the issue of establishing commercial representative offices in each other's countries and signing payment agreements as soon as possible.

Cao Zhongshu, head of the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation, also spoke at the meeting.

　　日本工商界人士集会一致要求取消“禁运”
    据新华社东京十日电　日本国际贸易促进协会等三十九个工商团体，九日下午在东京联合举行集会，听取以田岛正雄为首的日本工商界访华代表团的访华总结报告。
    参加报告会的有日本国际贸易促进协会会长村田省藏，日本通商产业省政务次官岛村一郎和工商界人士约六百人。中国商品展览团团长曹中枢、副团长萧向前等也应邀参加了报告会。
    报告会一致通过了以反对“禁运”为主要内容的决议，分送给日本政府和美国政府以及与“巴黎统筹委员会”有关的各国政府。
    给日本政府的决议要求日本政府对这次日本工商界访华代表团同中国各进出口公司签订的交易合同，予以支持和协助，同时尽速采取措施撤销或放宽“巴黎统筹委员会”的限制，同中国签订支付协定、互设商务代表机构和放宽出入国境的限制。
    给美国政府和与“巴黎统筹委员会”有关的各国政府的决议说，中国人民是爱好和平的。中国正在建设新的和平经济，把中国认为侵略国是不符合事实的。
    决议强调说，没有任何理由使日中两国间的经济交流继续被“巴黎统筹委员会”的人为的“禁运”所阻碍。决议接着说：我们不能不认为，这种措施如果继续下去，将阻碍东西方的往来，同时也妨碍着世界和平。
    决议要求与“巴黎统筹委员会”有关各国，坚决采取步骤撤销“禁运”限制。
    会上很多人讲话，希望促进日中贸易的发展。
    通商产业省政务次官岛村一郎代读了通商产业大臣石桥湛山的致词。石桥说，日本同中国的贸易数量，还远不及战前的水平。主要的原因是“禁运”的限制。他认为这次日本工商界代表团的访问中国，对中日两国间的交往，开辟了新的道路，并且打下了今后开展中日贸易的基础。他希望有关各方面共同努力，使中日贸易能获得进一步的发展。
    日本工商界访华代表团团长田岛正雄就他们在北京同中国方面达成的协议的具体内容作了详细的报告。他着重指出，只要撤销“巴黎统筹委员会”的限制，中日两国间就可以毫无阻碍地进行贸易。他并且强调必须早日解决中日两国互设商务代表机构和签订支付协定的问题。
    中国商品展览团团长曹中枢也在会上讲了话。
