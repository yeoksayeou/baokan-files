　　Autumn in the Miao Mountains brings a new look to everything. In the fields, the yellow millet and white cotton, set against the backdrop of lush green primeval forests, make the Kaili Miao Autonomous Region in Guizhou Province even more beautiful. Miao farmers are busily engaged in the autumn harvest on this beautiful land. In the courtyards of each household, plump, golden millet is spread out to dry, and bundles of tall, thick rice straw are neatly arranged in the fields, presenting a scene of abundant harvest.

　　I visited Dazhai Village, a village of forty-two households nestled along the banks of the Qingshui River. The village boasts the Longtou Agricultural Production Cooperative, comprising thirty-six members from three ethnic groups, including Miao and Han. The cooperative is known for the story of the three sisters: Three young women in the cooperative, named Hu Zhengying (Miao), Sun Shilan (Han), and Jin Yinchang, are all seventeen or eighteen years old and members of the Communist Youth League. Although they come from different ethnic groups, they are as closely united as real sisters. Previously, they were in a mutual aid team together, and later they all joined the agricultural production cooperative. In the past, they didn't know how to plow fields, transplant rice seedlings, or thresh grain, so they learned these skills from older farmers. They are unwilling to lag behind in production. In the past, the farmers in this village didn't have the habit of carrying manure from the market towns, fearing they would lose face. Once, the cooperative mobilized members to carry manure from Kaili Town, and some members were reluctant to go. The three of them said, "The Party teaches us that labor is glorious, what is there to be ashamed of?" Inspired by them, some young farmers also volunteered to sign up. Because of their hard work, the three of them were praised by the cooperative several times, and last year they were all named models in the production team. This year, in June, Hu Zhengying was also named a model member by the Youth League branch. Now, more than a dozen young women in the cooperative are united around them, and they actively respond to every call from the cooperative, never shrinking from any task or fearing any difficulties. They say, "We are not just three sisters, we are eighteen sisters now!"

　　The power of organization and the selfless labor of the members have enabled the Longtou Agricultural Production Cooperative to achieve a harvest surpassing last year's. This year, the total amount of fertilizer applied by the cooperative increased almost twofold compared to last year. In the summer, the fields encountered serious insect infestations and droughts. All the men, women, old, and young people in the cooperative went to the fields together, catching insects and watering the crops, not returning home for dinner until late at night. One night, Hu Zhengying, Sun Shilan, and several other women were missing from the cooperative, and everyone was very worried. They didn't return until almost dawn, after finishing watering the cornfields. The production enthusiasm of the members overcame the natural disasters.

　　According to preliminary calculations, the cooperative's corn production increased by more than fifty percent this year. Last year, the cooperative planted seven thousand tobacco plants, harvesting a total of one hundred and forty jin; this year, they planted twenty thousand plants, and have already harvested more than one thousand five hundred jin. Rice production increased by twenty percent, exceeding that of individual farmers by nineteen percent. The income of all the members has increased compared to last year.

　　When I met the three sisters, Hu Zhengying, Sun Shilan, and Jin Yinchang, I pointed to the two large piles of grain and asked them, "How will you ever be able to eat all this grain?" Hu Zhengying smiled and said, "Is it still too much? Only by producing more grain can we help the workers and older brothers manufacture more machines!"

    苗岭山下好年景
    本报记者　刘希
    秋天的苗岭山脉万象更新。田野里黄的谷子，白的棉花，映照着葱绿的原始森林，把贵州省凯里苗族自治区装饰得更加美丽。苗族农民正在这美丽的土地上紧张地进行秋收。各家的院坝里摊晒着饱满的、黄金色的谷子，又粗又高的稻草一簇簇整齐地在田里排列。呈现一片丰收景象。
    我访问了清水江畔居住着四十二户农民的大寨村，村子里有一个包括苗、汉等三个民族、三十六户社员的龙头农业生产合作社。合作社里流传着三姊妹的故事：社里有三个青年妇女，一个叫胡正英（苗族），一个叫孙士兰（汉族），另一个叫金银昌，都是十七、八岁的姑娘，青年团员。她们虽然不是一个民族，却亲密团结得像亲姊妹一样。以前在一个互助组里，后来又都加入了农业生产合作社。她们以前不会犁田、栽秧、打谷，就一起跟老年农民学会了犁田、栽秧、打谷。在生产上谁也不愿落后。过去这个村子的农民，没有到集镇上抬粪的习惯，怕丢脸。有一次社里动员社员到凯里镇上抬粪，有些社员不愿意去。她们三个人说：“党教育我们劳动是光荣的，有甚怕丢人的。”在她们的带动下，一些青年农民也自告奋勇地报了名。由于辛勤地劳动，她们三个人受到社里的几次表扬，去年她们在生产队里都被评为模范。今年六月，胡正英又被团支部评为模范团员。现在合作社的十几个青年妇女都团结在她们的周围，合作社的每一个号召，她们都积极响应，做任何活路都不畏缩，不怕困难。她们说：“我们不是三姊妹，是十八姊妹了。”
    组织起来的力量和社员们的忘我劳动，使龙头农业生产合作社又获得了超过去年的丰收。今年全社增施的肥料，差不多比去年增加一倍。夏天田里遇到了严重的虫灾和旱灾，她们全社男、女、老、幼一齐下田，抓虫的抓虫，浇水的浇水，直到深夜才回家吃饭。有一天晚上，合作社里找不到胡正英和孙士兰等几个妇女，大家都很挂念。直到快天亮的时候，她们才浇完了玉米田回来。社员们的生产积极性战胜了自然灾害。
    根据初步计算结果：今年合作社的玉米增产百分之五十以上。去年全社栽种了七千株烤烟，共收了一百四十斤；今年种了两万株，现已收一千五百多斤。稻谷增产百分之二十，比单干农民多增产百分之十九。社员都比去年增加了收入。
    当我会见了胡正英、孙士兰、金银昌三姊妹的时候，我指着两大堆粮食问她们：“你们这么多的粮食，怎样能吃得完哪？”胡正英笑了笑说：“还嫌多吗？我们多生产粮食，才能帮助工人老大哥多制造机器呢！”
