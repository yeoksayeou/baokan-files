Xinhua News Agency: Bombay – Bulganin and Khrushchev were welcomed at a reception held by Bombay Governor Matab on the evening of November 23rd.

On the morning of the 24th, Khrushchev and Bulganin attended a children's extracurricular art festival, visited a textile factory, and toured the Aarey state-owned milk farm, located 30 kilometers from the city.

During his visit to the milk farm, Khrushchev expressed his hope that the managers of the milk farm would visit the Soviet Union to see the Soviet agricultural exhibition and study Soviet agricultural achievements.

He said that in this area we can compete with you. Competition is necessary to improve work. Competition does not mean keeping each other's achievements secret. Competition is the mutual exchange of experience and knowledge, and no matter who wins in this competition, all participants benefit. Khrushchev emphasized the fundamental difference between the principles on which this competition is based and the principles of capitalist competition.

In the afternoon, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. This institute was established in the past with the help of Tata capital and is now almost entirely funded by the state. Under the leadership of Professor Bhabha and other prominent scientists, research is being conducted there on nuclear physics and cosmic rays.

That evening, Bombay State Chief Minister Desai held a reception for Bulganin and Khrushchev. Three hundred members of the Bombay State Legislative Assembly attended the reception.

Bulganin said at the reception that the Soviet Union, which has been freed from capitalism, and India, which has been freed from colonialism, can achieve great achievements in consolidating their independence and promoting the well-being of their people.

Bulganin said: We Soviet people have our great leader Lenin, who opened up a new path for the happy future of our people. You have your great leader Gandhi. Although these two great leaders had different philosophies, they had many things in common. They both taught their people how to liberate the country and build its independence.

In the evening, the Indo-Soviet Cultural Society held a banquet for the Soviet leaders.

Bulganin, Khrushchev, and their entourage left Bombay by plane on the morning of November 25th for Pune.

　　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫在孟买参观访问
    据新华社讯　孟买省长马塔布在十一月二十三日晚上举行招待会，欢迎布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫。
    二十四日上午，赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁参加了儿童课余艺术联欢大会，访问了一家纺织厂，并且参观了离城三十公里的阿雷国营牛奶场。
    赫鲁晓夫在参观牛奶场时，表示希望这个牛奶场的管理人员到苏联去参观苏联农业展览会和研究苏联农业的成就。
    他说，在这方面我们可以同你们竞赛。竞赛是改进工作所必需的。竞赛并不是把各人的成就保守秘密。竞赛是互相交换经验和知识而不问谁在这种竞赛中获胜，所有参加竞赛的人都得到好处。赫鲁晓夫着重说明了这种竞赛所依据的原则同资本主义竞争原则的基本差别。
    下午，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫访问了塔塔基本研究所。这个研究所在过去是借塔塔资本的帮助设立的，现在差不多完全是由国家供给经费了。在巴巴教授和其他著名科学家的领导下，那里正在研究核子物理和宇宙线等问题。
    这天晚上，孟买省首席部长德赛为布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫举行了招待会。三百名孟买省立法议员参加了招待会。
    布尔加宁在招待会上说，已经摆脱了资本主义的苏联和已经摆脱了殖民主义的印度能够在巩固他们的独立和促进他们人民的福利方面取得巨大的成就。
    布尔加宁说：我们苏维埃人民有我们伟大的领袖列宁，他为我国人民的幸福前途开辟了新的道路。你们有你们伟大的领袖甘地。虽然这两位伟大的领袖具有不同的哲学，但是，他们有许多共同点。他们两人都教导他们的人民怎样解放国家和建立它的独立。
    在晚上，印苏文化协会为苏联领袖举行了宴会。
    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫和随行人员在十一月二十五日早晨乘飞机离开孟买前往浦那。
