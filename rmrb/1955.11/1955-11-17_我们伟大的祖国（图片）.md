Our Great Motherland
The Xin Xin Agricultural Production Cooperative in the southern suburbs of Tianjin has eliminated 40% of illiteracy in the past three years. Now, 73 out of 118 members are literate, and more than 20 can read newspapers and write letters. Jiang Junying (second from the right), the leader of the first production team, was illiterate in the past. After three years of spare-time study, she can now read the Tianjin Suburban Peasant Newspaper and write letters. She is currently recording work points for the team members.
