    When the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory revised its fourth-quarter production plan, it only increased the original plan by two 75-horsepower locomobiles, three 7-horsepower ones, one water pump, and some parts for double-wheeled double-furrow plows.

    After studying Chairman Mao’s report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the factory's leadership and staff were determined to increase production to support agricultural cooperation. However, could production be further increased? There were many discussions. Some people said that it took a lot of effort to barely complete the plans for the first three quarters, indicating that production capacity had reached its peak. Some people said that although there was potential, it had been almost fully tapped. Although some people disagreed with these views, they lacked confidence and could not offer opposing opinions.

    The factory's Party committee felt that discussing whether production could be increased in the office was impractical and suggested that the administrative leadership and staff consult with the workers.

    In fact, the workers had long had opinions about the leadership. The workers said, "After studying Chairman Mao's instructions, we have been full of energy, but because the leadership's plan is conservative, I can't do more even if I want to!" At this moment, the leadership and staff found the workers, and as a result of the discussion, it was determined that the fourth quarter could produce an additional sixteen 7-horsepower locomobiles, four 75-horsepower ones, and another one thousand double-wheeled double-furrow plows.

    What experience is there in this? There is some. Some leading staff members of the Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory said well: "When drawing up the plan, we made the mistake of 'building a cart behind closed doors' and not trusting the masses, and we did not take into account the workers' enthusiasm to support industrialization and agricultural cooperation." It is clear that as long as we rely on the masses at all times, the potential in enterprises will never be exhausted!

    潜力在哪里
    石家庄动力机械厂修订第四季度生产计划的时候，只比原计划增加了七十五马力的锅驼机两台、七马力的三台、一台水泵、一部分双轮双铧犁的零件。
    这个厂的领导工作人员，学习了毛主席的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，决心增加生产，支援农业合作化。但是，能不能再增加生产呢？大家议论纷纷。有的人说费了好大的劲才勉强完成前三个季度的计划，说明生产能力已到了顶点。有的人说潜力虽有，已挖的差不多了。有人虽不同意这些看法，心里却没底，不能提出相反的意见。
    厂的党委会觉得在办公室里讨论能不能增产的问题不合乎实际，建议行政领导工作人员去找工人商量。
    实际上，工人对领导上早有意见。工人说：“学习毛主席指示以后，劲头早就蹩足了，就是因为领导上计划保守，使我想多干也干不了！”正在这个时候，领导工作人员找到了工人，讨论的结果，第四季度可以增产七马力锅驼机十六台、七十五马力的四台，另外还有双轮双铧犁一千部。
    这里面有什么经验呢？有的。石家庄动力机械厂的某些领导工作人员说得好：“订计划时我们犯了‘闭门造车’、不相信群众的错误，没有把工人支援工业化和农业合作化的积极性的因素估计进去。”很明显，只要时时刻刻依靠群众，企业中的潜力是永远挖不尽的！
