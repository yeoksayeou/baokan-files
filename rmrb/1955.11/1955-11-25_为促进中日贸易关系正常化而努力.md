　　Striving to Promote the Normalization of Sino-Japanese Trade Relations
　　Ji Chaoding, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade

The joint communiqué issued on October 17th by Peng Zhen, Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, and Uemura Kogoro, head of the Japanese Diet Members Delegation to China, reached a consensus on seven issues, including the realization of the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. This development in Sino-Japanese relations is the result of the joint efforts of the people of both countries over the past few years. It is of great significance for promoting the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations and strengthening the friendship between the people of China and Japan.

The joint communiqué contains two important points regarding Sino-Japanese trade relations.

The second point of the joint communiqué states: "Regarding trade relations, the regulations of the Coordinating Committee for Export Control (COCOM) have resulted in an increasing number of items embargoed by Japan to China. This situation must be changed, and efforts must be made to abolish it quickly."

The Chinese government and people have consistently advocated for free trade with Japan on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, according to the needs and possibilities of both sides, and for the development of broad trade relations. However, the Japanese government has preferred to violate the interests of its own people and implement the U.S. "embargo" policy. Only under the strong demands of the Japanese people has it reluctantly allowed the Japanese business community to conduct some extremely limited transactions with China, while the Japanese government has been unwilling to assume its due responsibilities and obligations. The Japanese government's implementation of the "embargo" policy has not and cannot prevent the development of China's economy; on the contrary, China's economic construction is flourishing. It is the Japanese economy that suffers from the disaster of the "embargo."

Recently, Japanese business people visited the Chinese Commodity Exhibition held in Tokyo, and their general impression was: "Many of the things Japan needs can be bought from China." One Japanese manufacturer said, "I feel how foolish it is to embargo China!" A shipbuilder from Hyogo Prefecture said, "If we don't export fishing boats to China, our shipyards will not be able to survive." Masao Tajima, head of the Japanese business delegation to China, also said in his statement at the end of his visit to China: "In the contracts we signed this time, we also included a lot of ships and steel products, etc., and these commodities are currently still within the scope of the embargo, so we can only sign reservation contracts. However, we must strive to eliminate this artificial obstacle and fulfill the contract." This urgent feeling of the Japanese business community is completely understandable, and the Chinese people fully sympathize with and support the efforts and demands of the Japanese people.

As everyone knows, the percentage of China's exports to Japan completed in the implementation of the Second Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement exceeded Japan's exports to China by about double. The reason is not that Japan does not have commodities to export to China, but that many commodities that Japan can export and that Japanese manufacturers are eager to export are blocked by the "embargo" measures of the "Coordinating Committee for Export Control."

Obviously, this measure of the "Coordinating Committee for Export Control" infringes upon Japan's independent autonomy and violates the interests of the Japanese people. The question is whether the Japanese government is willing to get rid of this artificial "embargo" constraint, assume its due responsibilities, and open the door to trade with China, based on the interests and demands of the Japanese people. If this can be done, there is no doubt that Sino-Japanese trade will develop rapidly.

The third point of the joint communiqué states: "The commodity exhibitions held in the capitals of China and Japan will be established as permanent institutions to handle liaison affairs related to trade between the two sides, and the two countries should provide due protection to the personnel dispatched by both sides."

Originally, the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement stipulated that both parties should have the right to establish permanent commercial representative offices with power and effectiveness; with such institutions, they could closely contact each other, understand each other's commodity supply and demand at any time, and solve problems related to trade between the two sides in a timely manner. However, the issue has remained unresolved because the Japanese government has refused to agree.

This spring, when the Chinese trade delegation visited Japan, it conducted extensive contact with the Japanese business community; recently, when the Japanese business delegation visited our country, it conducted specific trade negotiations and extensive visits and discussions. Everyone agreed that this exchange of visits by delegations from both sides is of great benefit to enhancing mutual understanding and promoting trade. However, everyone also felt that this kind of contact is inevitably limited. If there are permanent institutions with each other, it will be possible to maintain contact regularly and handle trade-related affairs in a timely manner. It should be said that this requirement is natural and necessary.

The Chinese Commodity Exhibition was exhibited in Japan and was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Japan. The reception room of the exhibition was crowded with people from various industries in the Japanese business community from morning to night, who inquired about various trade-related matters. It can be seen from this that it is a completely practical and feasible way to use the exhibition as a permanent institution to handle liaison affairs related to trade between the two sides. This can become a concrete step to implement the provisions of the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement that each other establishes a permanent commercial representative office with power and effectiveness. Katsumi Nozoe, a member of the Japanese Socialist Party, a member of the House of Councillors, and the leader of the Second Japanese Diet Members Delegation to the Soviet Union, said after visiting the Chinese Commodity Exhibition: In order to expand trade relations between China and Japan, it is only natural to establish this commodity exhibition as a permanent institution. Kozo Uchiyama, Vice President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, expressed his full support for the views expressed in the joint communiqué issued by Secretary-General Peng Zhen and Uemura Kogoro at the opening ceremony banquet held by the Chinese Commodity Exhibition Delegation in Tokyo, which aroused warm applause from the audience, which can also prove the eager hope of the Japanese trade community and the broad masses of people that the two countries will establish permanent trade institutions.

China and Japan have a long history of trade relations, are geographically close, and have many commodities that can be exchanged with each other, with various favorable conditions for developing trade. China is carrying out large-scale economic construction, and the living standards and purchasing power of the people are constantly improving, providing great prospects for the development of Sino-Japanese trade.

However, if Sino-Japanese trade is to achieve the large-scale development it deserves, the key lies in normalizing Sino-Japanese trade relations. This requires the signing of trade agreements between the two governments, the signing of payment agreements between the national banks of the two countries, the mutual establishment of commercial representative offices, and the abolition of "embargo" policies on trade. And the solution of these problems depends entirely on the attitude of the Japanese government.

In order to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade relations, the Chinese people will make unremitting efforts with consistent sincerity. On the Japanese side, as Tetsuya Katayama, a member of the Japanese Socialist Party and former Prime Minister, said after visiting the Tokyo Commodity Exhibition, the issue of normalizing Sino-Japanese relations lies in how to promote the Japanese government. He also said that the Japanese people should do their best to promote the Japanese government to normalize Sino-Japanese relations. The normalization of Sino-Japanese trade relations is, of course, an important part of the normalization of the entire Sino-Japanese relations. We believe that the Japanese people and people from all walks of life will actively work to promote the normalization of Sino-Japanese trade relations, so that Sino-Japanese trade can move forward smoothly along a normal track in the future.

### 为促进中日贸易关系正常化而努力

　　为促进中日贸易关系正常化而努力
　　中国国际贸易促进委员会副主席兼秘书长　冀朝鼎
    十月十七日，我国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真和日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉发表的联合公报，对实现中日邦交正常化等七项问题取得了一致的意见。中日两国关系上的这个发展，是两国人民几年来共同努力的结果。它对于促进中日关系的正常化，加强中日两国人民的友谊都有重大的意义。
    联合公报中，有两项是关于中日贸易关系的重要问题。
    联合公报的第二项写着：“在贸易关系上，由于巴黎统筹委员会的规定，日本对中国的禁运物品越来越多，这种情况必须予以变更，并且必须以迅速废除它为目标而努力。”
    中国政府和人民一贯主张和日本在平等互利的基础上，按照双方的需要和可能，自由地互通有无，发展广泛的贸易关系。然而，日本政府却宁愿违反它本国人民的利益，执行美国的“禁运”政策；只是在日本人民的强烈要求下，才勉强允许日本贸易界和中国做些极其有限的交易，而日本政府却不愿承担应有的责任和义务。日本政府执行“禁运”政策，对于中国来说，并没有也不可能阻止中国经济的发展；恰恰相反，中国的经济建设正在蓬勃发展。受到“禁运”的灾难的，只是日本的经济。
    最近，日本工商业界人士参观了在东京举行的中国商品展览会，他们普遍的印象是：“日本所需要的东西，很多可以从中国买到。”有一位日本厂商说：“我感到对中国禁运是多么愚蠢的事！”有一位来自兵库县的造船工业家说：“如果不向中国输出渔船，我们的造船厂就无法维持下去。”日本工商界访华代表团团长田岛正雄在结束这次访问中国的时候所发表的声明书中也说：“我们在这次签订的合同中，还包括了不少的船舶和钢铁制品等，而这些商品在目前还属于禁运范围，因此只能签订预约性合同。但是，我们要为排除这种人为的障碍和履行合同而努力。”日本工商界人士的这种迫切的心情是完全可以理解的，中国人民完全同情和支持日本人民这种努力和要求。
    大家知道，第二次中日贸易协议执行结果，中国对日本出口完成的百分比，超过了日本对中国出口一倍左右。原因不是日本没有商品可以向中国出口，而是日本有许多可以出口、日本厂商也热烈要求出口的商品，被“巴黎统筹委员会”的“禁运”措施堵住了。
    显然，“巴黎统筹委员会”这种措施，侵犯了日本的独立自主权，违犯了日本人民的利益。问题是日本政府是否愿意根据日本人民的利益和要求，摆脱这种人为的“禁运”束缚，承担起应负的责任，打开对中国贸易的大门。能够做到这样，无疑地中日贸易将会迅速地发展起来。
    联合公报的第三项写道：“把在中日两国首都举行的商品展览会作为常设的机构，以处理有关双方贸易的联络事务，两国应对双方所派遣的人员等互相予以应有的保护等。”
    本来，在第三次中日贸易协定中，曾规定双方互设有权力和有效的常驻商务代表机构；有了这种机构，就可以密切彼此间的联系，随时了解彼此的商品供需情况，及时地解决有关双方贸易的问题。但是，由于日本政府不肯同意，问题一直悬而未决。
    今年春天，中国贸易代表团访问日本时，曾和日本工商界进行了广泛的接触；最近日本工商界代表团来访我国时，进行了具体的贸易谈判和广泛的参观、座谈。大家一致感到双方代表团的这种交流来往，对增进彼此间的了解和促进贸易有很大益处。但是，大家也感到这种接触不免有局限性，如果彼此有常驻的机构，就能够经常地保持接触，及时地处理有关贸易的事务。应该说，这种要求是很自然的也是必要的。
    中国商品展览会在日本展出，受到日本各界广大人士的热烈欢迎。展览会的接待室里，每天从早到晚挤满了日本工商界各行业的人士，他们纷纷洽询各种有关贸易的事宜。由此可见，把展览会作为常设机构，处理有关双方贸易的联络事务，是完全切实可行的办法。这样就可以成为执行中日贸易第三次协议中互设有权力和有效的常驻商务代表机构的规定而采取的具体步骤。日本社会党参议员、日本国会议员访苏团第二团长野沟胜在参观中国商品展览会后说：为了扩大中日两国的贸易关系，把这个商品展览会作为常设机构也是理所当然的。日中友好协会副会长内山完造在中国商品展览团在东京举行开幕式宴会上表示完全支持彭真秘书长和上林山荣吉团长所发表的联合公报的意见的时候，引起全场热烈鼓掌，也可以证明日本贸易界和广大人民迫切希望两国互设贸易常设机构的心情。
    中日两国有悠久的贸易关系，地理邻近，彼此可以交换的商品很多，具备着发展贸易的各种便利条件。中国正进行大规模的经济建设，人民生活水平和购买力不断地普遍提高，给中日贸易提供了很大的发展前途。
    然而，要使中日贸易得到应有的大规模发展，关键在于使中日贸易关系正常化。这就需要签订两国政府间的贸易协定，签订两国国家银行间的支付协定，互设商务代表机构，废除贸易上的“禁运”政策。而这些问题的解决，完全是要看日本政府的态度如何。
    为了促进中日贸易关系的正常化，中国人民将本着一贯的诚意，进行不懈的努力。在日本方面，诚如日本社会党国会议员、前首相片山哲在参观东京商品展览会后所说的，中日关系正常化的问题在于怎样来推动日本政府。他并表示日本人民应该为推动日本政府使中日关系正常化而尽最大的努力。中日贸易关系的正常化，当然是整个中日关系正常化的重要组成部分。我们相信日本人民和各界人士一定会积极努力促进中日贸易关系的正常化，使中日贸易今后能够循着正常的轨道顺利前进。
