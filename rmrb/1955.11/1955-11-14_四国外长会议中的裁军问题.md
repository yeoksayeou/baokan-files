　　Disarmament Issue in the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference
　　The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has discussed the disarmament issue. This is another of the most important and pressing issues on the agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and also one of the issues that peace-loving people around the world are most concerned about. For a long time, the people of all countries have been urgently demanding an early end to the arms race in order to eliminate the threat of a new war; the Ninth United Nations General Assembly and the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference have both made corresponding resolutions and instructions for this purpose. Therefore, the people of all countries expect the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to make practical contributions in this regard. It is precisely this universal demand of the people that has made the foreign ministers of the three Western countries unable to avoid affirming the necessity of disarmament and using conciliatory tones in their speeches. However, the conference ultimately failed to conduct a full discussion on this urgent issue and reach the due agreement. The Western countries should be responsible for this. They used the same tactics as when discussing the first item on the agenda, avoiding the substantive issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, while emphasizing the subordinate and technical issues of specific methods of implementation of supervision. The attitude of the Western countries in evading the substance and pursuing the superficiality is in sharp contrast to the Soviet Union's sincere pursuit of agreement and realistic handling of issues.
　　Based on the consistent desire to strive for peace and the security of the people of all countries, the Soviet delegation put forward suggestions on reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons at the Foreign Ministers Conference. This proposal calls on the four governments to clearly record the consensus they have already reached on the level of armed forces, the order of measures to be implemented for the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the establishment of effective international supervision over the implementation of measures for reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons. At the same time, it also advocates reviewing the various proposals related to disarmament that have been successively put forward by the governments of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France within the United Nations Organization in order to reach the necessary agreements. This proposal also requires the four governments to declare that before the conclusion of a convention on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons, they undertake the obligation not to be the first to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons against any country, and calls on all other countries to participate in this declaration as well. Obviously, accepting the Soviet proposal would achieve practical progress on the disarmament issue and create favorable conditions for countries to further seek a complete agreement on this important issue. In particular, if the four major powers declare that they will not be the first to use atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, this will greatly strengthen the confidence of the people of all countries in eliminating the threat of a new war.
　　The Western countries also put forward a statement on the issue of disarmament. In this statement, the Western countries regard the implementation of international supervision and inspection as a prerequisite for reaching a disarmament agreement. US Secretary of State Dulles stated that if the Soviet Union agrees to this proposal, the United States is prepared to apply its proposals on the exchange of military intelligence and aerial photography to countries other than the Soviet Union and the United States. In this regard, the attitude of the United States is clearer than before. However, the important issue is that the Western countries' proposals completely ignore the issue of implementing the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Talking about international supervision and inspection in this situation is shooting at a target that doesn't exist.
　　It must be pointed out that, judging from the attitude of the Western countries at the Foreign Ministers Conference, their position on the disarmament issue is not advancing, but retreating. Because people know that, due to the sincere efforts of the Soviet Union, the four governments have reached agreement on several important issues in the disarmament plan. In its proposal of May 10 this year, the Soviet Union accepted the levels to which the armed forces of the five major powers should be reduced, the stages for implementing the disarmament plan, and the effective date of the decision to prohibit atomic weapons in the Western countries' proposal. Therefore, the Soviet Union has taken a big step closer to the Western countries in this regard. However, when the Soviet Union approached the Western countries, the United States dodged away again. At the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee in New York, the US representative declared that the United States "reserved" its previous position on the disarmament issue and has been avoiding any specific measures for implementing the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This regressive policy of the United States is the fundamental reason why the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee has not made any concrete progress on the disarmament issue. The proposals put forward by the Western countries at the Foreign Ministers Conference this time are exactly the same as the outdated arguments of the United States in the Disarmament Subcommittee. This position of the Western countries will not only not be of any help in promoting the resolution of the disarmament issue, but is obviously harmful.
　　The United States insists that only by first implementing international supervision can trust be restored between countries, especially mutual trust between major powers, otherwise the reduction of armaments is "impossible" in fact. This position is fundamentally untenable. Because since measures for reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons are not implemented simultaneously, then what can be supervised and inspected? The implementation of such international supervision and inspection can only lead to one result, that is: on the one hand, there is so-called international supervision and inspection, and on the other hand, one can more freely expand armaments and accumulate atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons in greater quantities. In that case, the so-called international supervision and inspection is nothing more than a disguise for expanding armaments and preparing for a new war, which can only aggravate the danger of another war. Where can one talk about strengthening international trust? The purpose of this approach is only to deceive the public and make them relax their efforts to demand disarmament.
　　No one denies the importance of establishing effective international supervision over the implementation of the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet Union's May 10 proposal and the proposal put forward at the Foreign Ministers Conference this time both emphasized the importance of this issue. However, this international supervision must be closely linked with specific steps related to the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. To this end, the Soviet Union put forward its own practical and feasible suggestions on implementing international supervision in its May 10 proposal, especially the suggestion on establishing monitoring posts in important locations to prevent one country from launching a surprise attack on another country. Implementing the Soviet proposal would guarantee effective supervision over the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Not only that, the Soviet Union also seriously considered the US proposal on the exchange of military intelligence and aerial photography. Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out at the Foreign Ministers Conference on November 10 that if the measures contained in these proposals are closely integrated with the task of reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, the Soviet Union is willing to give sympathetic consideration to such proposals and believes that the issue of aerial photography can be considered as one of the forms of supervision for the final stage of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. This shows that the Soviet Union is striving to reach a consensus with the Western countries not only on specific measures for achieving disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, but also on the issue of establishing international supervision.
　　While emphasizing international supervision, the Western countries also deny the possibility of establishing effective supervision, thereby even believing that universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons are fundamentally impossible. The foreign ministers of the three Western countries have all expressed this meaning in their speeches. This clearly exposes the intention of the Western countries: they refuse to implement disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Therefore, Dulles even openly rejected the Soviet Union's proposals on destroying atomic weapons, stopping the testing of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and the four countries guaranteeing not to be the first to use atomic weapons before reaching a complete disarmament agreement. This statement by Dulles, linked with the recent clamor of some American generals and officials, especially US Air Force Secretary Quarles, about developing the US atomic air power in order to "destroy Communist Russia," clearly shows what the purpose of the United States is in talking about supervision while actually refusing disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.
　　People know that the Western countries deliberately created a stalemate on the issue of European security to obstruct the resolution of that issue. They have also taken regressive steps on the disarmament issue. Moreover, according to reports from Western news agencies, the Western countries have also adopted an attitude of unwillingness to reach an agreement on the issue of developing East-West contacts, especially refusing to abolish artificial trade restrictions and discriminatory policies. All of this not only does not conform to the spirit of the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries and the desire of the people of all countries to demand peace and strengthen international trust, but is also a blatant violation of the "Geneva spirit." What the Western countries have done can only give people such an impression.
　　The foreign ministers of the Western countries, especially US Secretary of State Dulles, have stated that they are unwilling and do not intend to return to the situation that existed before the Four-Power Heads of Government Conference in July this year. If this statement is sincere, people have reason to expect them to adopt another attitude, that is, an attitude of striving to seek agreement.
　　The Chinese people resolutely support the Soviet Union's proposals on reducing armaments and prohibiting atomic weapons, as well as its firm position on the disarmament issue. Because the path prescribed by the Soviet proposals is the real path to end the arms race and free the people of all countries from the threat of another war.

### 四国外长会议中的裁军问题

　　四国外长会议中的裁军问题
    四国外长会议已经讨论了裁军问题。这是外长会议议程上另一项最重要、最迫切的问题，同时也是全世界爱好和平人民最关心的问题之一。各国人民长期以来一直迫切地要求早日结束军备竞赛，以消除新战争的威胁；第九届联合国大会和四国政府首脑会议都曾为此作出了相应的决议和指示。因此，各国人民都期待四国外长会议能够在这方面作出实际的贡献。正是人民的这一普遍要求，使得西方三国外长不能不在他们的发言中间肯定裁军的必要性并且使用了和解的语调。但是，会议终究未能在这个迫切的问题上进行充分的讨论并达成应有的协议，西方国家是应该负责的，它们在这个问题上使用了它们在讨论第一项议程时的同样策略，避开裁军和禁止原子武器这些实质问题，而强调实施监督的具体方法这样从属的、技术性的问题。西方国家的这种避实就虚的态度和苏联的真诚地谋求协议和实事求是地处理问题的态度形成鲜明的对照。
    苏联代表团本着争取和平和各国人民安全的一贯愿望，在外长会议上提出了关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议。这个建议要求四国政府把它们在武装部队水平问题上、禁止原子武器应当实行的措施的次序问题上，以及应对裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施的实行建立有效的国际监督问题已经取得的一致意见，明确地记录下来。同时它还主张在联合国组织中审查苏、美、英、法四国政府已经先后提出有关裁军问题的各项建议，以求达成必要的协议。这个建议并要求四国政府宣布，在关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的公约缔结以前，承担不首先对任何国家使用原子武器和氢武器的义务，并呼吁其余一切国家也参加这一宣言。很显然，接受苏联的这个建议就能在裁军问题上求得实际的进展，并将为各国在这个重要的问题上进一步谋求完全的协议造成有利的条件。特别是如果四大国宣布它们不首先使用原子武器和氢武器，这将大大加强各国人民对于消除新战争威胁的信心。
    西方国家也提出了一个关于裁军问题的声明。在这个声明中，西方国家把实行国际监督和视察作为达成裁军协议的先决条件。美国国务卿杜勒斯表示，如果苏联同意这个建议，美国准备把它关于交换军事情报和空中摄影的建议适用于苏联和美国以外的国家。在这方面美国的态度比以前明确了。但是，重要的问题是西方国家的建议对于实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题完全撇开不谈。在这种情况来谈国际监督和视察就是无的放矢。
    不能不指出：从西方国家在外长会议上的态度看来，它们在裁军问题上的立场不是前进了，而是倒退了。因为人们知道，由于苏联的真诚努力，四国政府在裁军计划的若干重要问题上的意见已经一致了。苏联在它的今年五月十日的建议中，接受了西方国家建议中关于五大国武装部队裁减到的水平、关于实施裁减军备计划的阶段以及关于禁止原子武器的决定的生效时期，因此苏联在这方面已向西方国家靠近了一大步。但是，当苏联向西方国家走近了的时候，美国却又躲开去了。在纽约举行的联合国裁军小组委员会上，美国代表就声明美国“保留”它以前在裁军问题上的立场，并且对于实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的具体措施问题一直避而不谈。美国的这种倒退政策，是联合国裁军小组委员会在裁军问题上没有取得任何具体进展的根本原因。这次西方国家在外长会议上提出的建议，和美国在裁军小组委员会上的陈旧论点是一模一样的。西方国家这种立场对于促进裁军问题的解决不但不会有丝毫的帮助，而且显然是有害的。
    美国硬说只有先实行国际监督，才能恢复国与国之间的信任，特别是大国之间的相互信任，否则裁减军备在事实上是“不可能的”。这种立场是根本站不住脚的。因为既然并不同时实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器的措施，那末有什么可以监督和视察的呢？实行这样的国际监督和视察只能造成一种结果，那就是：一方面存在着所谓的国际监督和视察，另一方面却可以更自由地实行扩充军备和更大量地累积原子武器和氢武器。在那样的情况下，所谓的国际监督和视察只不过是扩充军备和准备新战争的掩饰物罢了，这只能加剧另一次战争的危险，哪里还谈得上什么加强国际信任呢？这种做法的目的只是为了欺骗公众，使他们放松要求裁减军备的努力。
    没有人否认对实行裁减军备和禁止原子武器建立有效国际监督的重要性。苏联五月十日的建议和这次在外长会议上提出的建议，都强调了这一问题的重要性。但是，这种国际监督必须同采取有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器的具体步骤密切联系起来。为此，苏联在五月十日的建议中提出了自己的关于实行国际监督的实际可行的建议，特别是关于为防止一个国家对另一个国家发动突然袭击而在重要地点建立监察所的建议。实行苏联的建议就能够保证对裁减军备和禁止原子武器实行有效的监督。不仅这样，苏联也郑重地考虑了美国关于交换军事情报和空中摄影的建议。莫洛托夫外长在十一月十日的外长会议上就指出，如果这些建议所包含的措施是密切结合着裁减军备和禁止原子武器的任务，苏联愿意对这种建议给予同情的考虑，并且认为可以把空中摄影问题作为对裁军和禁止原子武器最后阶段进行监督的形式之一来考虑。这表明，苏联不仅在实现裁军和禁止原子武器的具体措施上，而且在建立国际监督的问题上，也力求和西方国家取得一致的意见。
    西方国家一方面强调国际监督，另一方面又否定建立有效监督的可能性，从而甚至认为根本不能够实行普遍裁军和禁止原子武器。西方三国外长在他们的发言中都曾表示了这种意思。这就明明白白地暴露了西方国家的意图：它们拒绝实行裁军和禁止原子武器。因而，杜勒斯甚至公开拒绝苏联关于销毁原子武器、停止原子武器和氢武器的试验，以及在达成完全的裁军协议以前四国保证不首先使用原子武器的建议。杜勒斯的这种表示和美国的一些将军和官员们，特别是美国空军部长卡利斯最近关于发展美国原子空中力量，以便“可以摧毁共产党俄国”的喧嚷联系起来，就很清楚地看出，美国空谈监督而实际上拒绝裁军和禁止原子武器的目的究竟何在。
    人们知道，西方国家在欧洲安全的问题上故意制造了一个僵局，来阻挠那个问题的解决。在裁军问题上它们又采取了倒退的步骤。并且，根据西方通讯社的报道，西方国家在发展东西方接触的问题上也采取了不愿达成协议的态度，特别是拒绝取消人为的贸易限制和歧视政策。所有这一切不但不符合四国政府首脑指示的精神和各国人民要求和平和加强国际信任的愿望，而且是对“日内瓦精神”的公然违反。西方国家的所做所为只能令人有这样一种看法。
    西方国家的外长，特别是美国国务卿杜勒斯曾表示，它们不愿意，也不打算回到今年七月四国政府首脑会议以前存在的局面。如果这种说法是真诚的话，人们有理由期待他们采取的是另一种态度，即：努力寻求协议的态度。
    中国人民坚决支持苏联关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的建议，以及它在裁军问题上的坚定的立场。因为苏联的建议所规定的道路，是结束军备竞赛和使各国人民摆脱另一次战争威胁的真正的道路。
