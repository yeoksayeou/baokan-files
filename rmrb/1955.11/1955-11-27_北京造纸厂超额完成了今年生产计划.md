　　Beijing Paper Mill Exceeds This Year's Production Plan

To the Editor:

    Our state-owned Beijing Paper Mill has already exceeded this year's national production plan. The output plan for the main product, poster paper, was fulfilled by 114.21%, the total production value plan by 108.28%, the profit delivery plan by 242.93%, and the cost is expected to be 7.42% lower than the state plan.

    The achievements we have made in production are the result of the active efforts and overcoming of difficulties by all employees under the leadership of the Party. In the first quarter of this year, due to limited sales of glazed paper, our No. 2 paper machine was converted to produce 60-gram poster paper. This was a new product, and the workers lacked experience in equipment conditions, raw material ratios, etc., so they encountered many problems in production. For example, at the beginning of January, when paper edge pulp and reed pulp were mixed, the produced poster paper had severe fluffing problems, and the printed poster pictures were blurred. As a result, there were many user complaints. The administrative leaders of our factory went to the paper-using units to listen to opinions and learn from the experience of fraternal factories. After returning to the factory, they held technical seminars and factory-wide employee meetings to discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided to use reed pulp as the raw material for the paper core and paper edge pulp as the raw material for the paper surface, and to replace the felt with fine-grained ones. This not only solved the fluffing problem, but also increased the gloss and water resistance of the paper. The user units were satisfied with this improved product. The Beijing Fine Arts Printing Factory used this paper to test print multi-color offset prints, continuously printing more than 3,500 sheets, and the picture was still very clear. This paper can also be used to make packaging paper for cigarettes and food, which can reduce the cost by 34% compared to using double-sided coated printing paper. As a result, the sales of poster paper have expanded. This year's annual output will increase by more than 400 tons compared to the plan.

    In June, we studied the use of newspaper edge pulp to replace reed pulp, and the effect was good. This can not only reduce costs but also solve the problem of insufficient reed pulp supply. Now the newspaper edge pulp we use has increased from 10% to 35%, and it is estimated that more than 143 tons of reed pulp can be saved by the end of the year.

    In addition, according to the experience of fraternal factories, we have increased the ratio of fillers and adopted the method of adding talc powder after alum to improve the retention rate, so that the amount of pulp used per ton of glazed paper has been reduced from 1,079 kg in January to 1,035 kg, and the amount of pulp used per ton of poster paper has been reduced from 1,048 kg to 939 kg.

### 北京造纸厂超额完成了今年生产计划

　　北京造纸厂超额完成了今年生产计划编辑同志：
    我们国营北京造纸厂已经超额完成了今年的国家生产计划，主要产品招贴纸产量计划完成了百分之一百一十四点二一，生产总值计划完成了百分之一百零八点二八，上缴利润计划完成了百分之二百四十二点九三，成本预计可以比国家计划降低百分之七点四二。
    我们在生产中取得这样的成绩，是全体职工在党的领导下积极努力、克服困难的结果。今年第一季度，因为有光纸受销路所限，我厂的二号造纸机改为生产六十克招贴纸。这是一种新产品，职工们对设备条件、原材料配比等都缺乏经验，因此在生产中遇到了很多问题。如一月初纸边浆和苇浆混合使用时，生产的招贴纸拔毛情况严重，印刷的招贴画画面模糊。因此，用户意见很多。我们厂的行政领导同志就到用纸单位听取意见，并且到兄弟厂吸取经验。回厂后召开了技术研究会和全厂职工会讨论。结果，决定改用苇浆作纸里原料、纸边浆作纸面原料，并且把毛布换成细纹的。这样，不但解决了拔毛问题，而且还使纸张增加了光度，提高了耐水度。这种改进后的产品，使用单位都感到满意。北京美术印刷厂曾用这种纸试印多色胶版，连续印了三千五百多张，画面还是非常清楚。这种纸还能用来做纸烟、食品的包装纸，比用双面光胶版印刷纸包装成本可以降低百分之三十四。由于这样，招贴纸的销路扩大了。今年年产量将比计划增加四百多吨。
    六月份，我们又研究用报纸边浆代替苇浆，效果良好。这不仅可以降低成本，还能解决苇浆供应不足的问题。现在我们所用的报纸边浆已由百分之十增至百分之三十五，预计年终可节省苇浆一百四十三吨多。
    另外，我们又根据兄弟厂的经验，增加了填料的配比，采取使矾后加滑石粉的方法来提高含留率，使每吨有光纸的用浆量由一月份的一千零七十九公斤降低至一千零三十五公斤，每吨招贴纸的用浆量由一千零四十八公斤降低为九百三十九公斤。
