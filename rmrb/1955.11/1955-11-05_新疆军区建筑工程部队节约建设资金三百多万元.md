The Construction Engineering Corps of the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps has saved the state more than 3.8 million yuan in construction funds since July. Among them, 3.2 million yuan was saved by the design department after reviewing the construction projects that have started, are about to start, and are still in the design stage, and merging 32 projects. The construction units of the engineering corps have vigorously promoted advanced experience, improved operating techniques, and reduced project costs, which has also saved a large amount of funds. For example, the bricklaying teams in the Urumqi work area have universally learned and promoted the Soviet Shavlyugin's bricklaying method, which is expected to save 69,000 yuan for the whole year. The experience of using reeds instead of batten ceilings on construction sites in Beijing has also been promoted in this engineering corps, and so far it has saved more than 62,200 yuan. Each work area has also organized more than 50 economy teams to collect construction waste materials. In September alone, the nails, scrap iron, hemp rope, wood, leftover paint, etc. collected were worth more than 21,000 yuan. (Xinjiang Daily Editorial Department)

    新疆军区建筑工程部队节约建设资金三百多万元
    新疆军区生产建设兵团建筑工程部队，七月份以来，已给国家节约了建设资金三百八十多万元。其中有三百二十万元是设计部门在审查了已经开工的和即将开工的以及尚在设计的建筑工程项目之后，合并了三十二项工程而节约下来的。工程部队各施工单位，大力推广先进经验、改进操作技术、降低工程造价，也节约了大批资金。如乌鲁木齐工区各砖工工队普遍学习和推广了苏联沙夫留金的砌砖法，预计全年能节省六万九千元。北京建筑工地用苇子代替板条天棚的经验，也已在这个工程部队中推广，到现在已经节约了六万二千二百多元。各工区还组织了五十多个节约队，收集建筑废料，仅九月份收集起来的钉子、废铁、麻绳、木料、残剩油漆等就值两万一千多元。（新疆日报编辑部）
