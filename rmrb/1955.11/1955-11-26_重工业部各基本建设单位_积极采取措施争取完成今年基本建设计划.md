　　Basic Construction Units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
　　Actively Take Measures to Strive to Complete This Year's Basic Construction Plan

　　(Our report) The basic construction units of the Ministry of Heavy Industry system are actively taking measures to accelerate the construction progress and strive to complete the basic construction plan for 1955.

　　In mid-September, the Ministry of Heavy Industry, in light of the slow construction progress of many basic construction units, issued an emergency instruction on ensuring the completion of the 1955 basic construction plan. Based on this instruction, the basic construction units first strengthened their organizational leadership. For example, the Third Engineering Company directly under the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry established an office for the comprehensive completion of tasks to strengthen the inspection and supervision of the implementation of the construction plan. At the same time, it convened a meeting of Party activists to convey and discuss the emergency instructions of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and mobilize employees to improve construction efficiency. The company completed its construction tasks in October, reversing the situation of failing to complete the plan every month.

　　Various construction departments and construction units have strengthened coordination and cooperation. The construction departments and construction units of many units, such as Benxi Iron and Steel Company, Tongguanshan Mining Bureau, and Yunnan Tin Industry Company, have implemented a joint office system. The Tongguanshan Mining Bureau organized the heads of the construction department, production department, construction department, and design department to form a four-person team, and established a joint office for key projects with the participation of the above four departments, responsible for negotiating and resolving problems in construction and ensuring the smooth progress of basic construction work. A track-laying project under the pit of the mining bureau was originally estimated to be unable to be completed this year due to the mutual involvement of production and construction. Now, after the above-mentioned institutions have properly arranged production and construction, it has been determined that it can be completed this year.

　　The basic construction units also inspected the design, equipment, materials, and labor preparation of various projects, and took measures such as sending people to urge the acquisition of drawings and equipment to solve the problems found in the inspection. Many units have also decided to start some projects that were originally scheduled to be constructed next year but are now ready for construction ahead of schedule this year. According to current statistics, units such as Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Benxi Iron and Steel Company, and Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant have decided to start projects ahead of schedule, totaling 2.3 percent of the total basic construction workload of the Ministry of Heavy Industry for the whole year. Some basic construction units in Northeast and North China regions have stepped up preparations for winter construction. Many projects have been put into winter construction in a timely manner.

　　Due to the adoption of the above-mentioned measures, the construction situation has improved compared with the past. In October, seven units including Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, the Third Engineering Company directly under the Construction Bureau, the Fourth Engineering Company, and Tianjin Engineering Office completed their construction plans.

### 重工业部各基本建设单位　积极采取措施争取完成今年基本建设计划

　　重工业部各基本建设单位
　　积极采取措施争取完成今年基本建设计划
    本报讯　重工业部系统各基本建设单位积极采取措施加速施工进度，争取完成一九五五年的基本建设计划。
    九月中旬，重工业部根据不少基本建设单位施工进度缓慢的情况，发出了关于保证完成一九五五年基本建设计划的紧急指示。各基本建设单位根据这一指示，首先加强了组织领导工作。如重工业部建筑局直属第三工程公司成立了全面完成任务办公室，加强施工计划执行情况的检查督促，同时召开党的活动分子会议，传达和讨论了重工业部的紧急指示，发动职工提高施工效率。这个公司在十月份完成了施工任务，扭转了月月完不成计划的局面。
    各建设部门和施工部门都加强了协作配合。本溪钢铁公司、铜官山矿务局、云南锡业公司等许多单位的建设部门和施工部门都实行了联合办公制度。铜官山矿务局组织建设部门、生产部门、施工部门和设计部门的负责人共同组成四人小组，并且设立了有上述四部门参加的重点工程联合办公室，负责协商解决施工中的问题，保证基本建设工作的顺利进行。这个矿务局的一项坑下铺轨工程，由于生产、施工互相牵扯，原来估计今年不能完成，现在经过上述机构对生产和施工加以妥善安排，已经确定可以在今年完工。
    各基本建设单位还对各项工程的设计、设备、材料、劳动力准备情况进行了检查，并且采取派人催取图纸、设备等办法解决检查中发现的问题。许多单位还决定将一部分原定在明年施工、现在已经具备施工条件的工程提前在今年开工。据目前统计，鞍山钢铁公司、本溪钢铁公司、太原钢铁厂等单位决定提前开工的工程，共达今年全年重工业部基本建设工作量的百分之二点三。东北、华北地区的一些基本建设单位抓紧进行了冬季施工准备工作。许多工程已经及时投入了冬季施工。
    由于采取上述各种措施，施工情况已较前好转。十月份有鞍山钢铁建设公司、建筑局直属第三工程公司、第四工程公司、天津工程处等七个单位完成了施工计划。
