　　Heilongjiang to Use Ice Sleds for Winter Transportation

　　The Heilongjiang Provincial Shipping Administration Bureau will begin using ice sleds (commonly known as "pala") for winter ice transportation this year.

　　The four major rivers in Northeast China—Songhua River, Heilongjiang River, Wusuli River, and Nenjiang River—have a freezing period of approximately 160 to 180 days each winter, making it impossible for ships to operate. To overcome this natural obstacle in inland river transportation, the Heilongjiang Provincial Shipping Administration Bureau established a Winter Transportation Experiment Committee in October to prepare for winter ice sled transportation.

　　Using ice sleds for transportation on inland rivers in our country is an innovation. The bureau began researching this work as early as the winter of 1952. Successful trials were conducted in 1953 and 1954. This year, it has been decided to use ice sleds for small-volume transportation over shorter distances. Currently, the organization of cargo sources and all preparations are actively underway. Soon, twenty-five ice sleds will be operating on the Songhua River, towed by two automobiles and two tractors each, commencing ice transportation. (Li Yisha)

　　黑龙江将用冰橇进行冬季运输
    黑龙江省航运管理局今年将开始用冰橇（俗称爬犁）进行冬季冰上运输。
    东北松花江、黑龙江、乌苏里江、嫩江等四大主要河流，每年冬季约有一百六十天到一百八十天的冰冻期，船舶无法进行运输。黑龙江省航运管理局为克服内河运输上的这一天然障碍，十月份成立了冬季运输试验委员会，着手进行冬季用冰橇运输的筹备工作。
    在我国内河上使用冰橇运输是一个创举。该局从一九五二年冬就已开始研究这一工作。一九五三年和一九五四年又曾进行过两次成功的试验。今年，已经决定用冰橇作较短距离的小量运输。目前，组织货源和一切准备工作正在积极进行，不久，在松花江上将有二十五台冰橇，由汽车和拖拉机各两部拖拉开始在冰上运输。　（李一沙）
