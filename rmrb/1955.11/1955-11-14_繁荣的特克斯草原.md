　　Prosperous Tekes Grassland
　　Xiao Du, Lian Shan
    In the Tekes Grassland surrounded by mountains, it is now the season of "autumn high and horses fat." More than six thousand households of Kazakh, Kirgiz, and Mongolian herders are gradually moving from the summer pastures in the Tianshan Mountains to the plains at the foot of the mountains. Herds of livestock and yurts with smoke rising from their chimneys are scattered on both banks of the Tekes River, stretching for one or two hundred li along the hillsides and foothills. From the grassland, the sounds of horses neighing are often heard, and Kazakh herdsmen with long whips are herding and grazing their livestock with joy. As the number of livestock has increased by more than 17% compared to last year, the herders' enthusiasm for production is high. They have just finished shearing wool and are immediately paying close attention to grazing the sheep, conducting autumn sheep mating work; in addition, they are also busily storing fodder, building sheds and pens, and constructing windbreaks to prepare for the safe wintering and spring survival of their livestock. Although the pasture on the Tekes Grassland is not as lush this year as in previous years, the winter grass stored by the herders is richer than in any previous year. The existing winter grass is enough to last until February or March next year. Herdsmen of the Abuduhan Pastoral Year-Round Mutual Aid Group in Habushalang Township, Fifth District, even climbed over mountains and ridges to the remote deep mountains to cut the fresh pasture in the untouched deep mountain pastures. Now, every family's felt tent and the roof of their mud house are piled high with haystacks.
    The bumper harvest of various livestock and livestock products has brought a scene of joy and prosperity to the Tekes Grassland. Since the beginning of autumn, the market in Tekes County, the center of the grassland, has been particularly lively every day by noon, and the streets are full of horses with bright saddles and bridles tethered. After selling their livestock products to the state purchasing station, the herders coming down from the mountains crowded into the department of state-owned stores and cooperatives, selecting the things they need for production and life. According to the statistics of the livestock product purchasing department in early October, the herders sold more than 94,000 kilograms of wool to the state alone, accounting for more than 72% of the actual wool production in the county. At the same time, the quantity of various production and living materials supplied by state-owned stores and cooperatives to the herders is also increasing month by month. Among them, cloth, tea, sugar, boots and shoes are the most popular among the herders. Many herders' families are already using brand-new copper kettles, alloy pots, iron stoves, and enameled buckets for their daily lives. Herders are particularly satisfied with the establishment of state-owned stores and cooperatives on the grassland. Sagetber, a sixty-year-old Kazakh herdsman, happily said: "The state can set up state-owned stores in the deep mountain grassland, so we will no longer be afraid of not being able to buy things and being deceived and exploited by merchants."

　　繁荣的特克斯草原
　　萧渡　练善
    在群山环抱的特克斯草原上，现在正是“秋高马肥”的季节，六千多户哈萨克、柯尔克孜和蒙古等族的牧民，都从天山上的夏季牧场逐渐转移到山麓平川地带来了。成群的牲畜和冒着炊烟的蒙古包。散布在特克斯河两岸，绵延一两百里的山坡和山麓一带。草原上，不时传来马群嘶鸣的声音，手执长鞭的哈萨克牧民赶着畜群，愉快地在牧放着。由于今年大小牲畜又比去年增加了百分之十七以上，牧民的生产热情高涨。他们刚剪完羊毛，就马上加意地牧放羊群，进行秋季绵羊配种工作；另外还紧张地储备饲草饲料、搭盖棚圈和修筑防风墙，准备牲畜安全过冬和过春。今年特克斯草原上的牧草虽然长得不如往年茂盛，但牧民们储备的冬草却比过去任何一年都丰富。现有的冬草足够吃到明年二、三月。第五区哈布沙浪乡阿不都汗牧业常年互助组的牧民，还翻山越岭到遥远的深山里去，把人迹不到的深山草场上鲜嫩的牧草，也割了回来。现在，无论那一家牧民的毡房旁边和泥土房子的屋顶上，都堆垛着高高的草堆。
    各种牲畜和畜产品的丰收，使特克斯草原呈现出一片欢乐和繁荣的景象。入秋以来，在草原中心的特克斯县的市场上，每天一到中午就特别热闹起来，满街都拴着鞍辔鲜明的马匹。从山上下来的牧民把畜产品卖给国家收购站以后，拥挤在国营商店和合作社的门市部里，选购自己生产和生活上需要的东西。据畜产品收购部门十月初的统计，牧民们卖给国家的畜产品中，单是羊毛就已经有九万四千多公斤，占全县羊毛实产量的百分之七十二以上。同时，国营商店和合作社供应给牧民的各种生产和生活资料的数量也逐月增多。其中布匹、茶、糖、靴鞋等最受牧民的欢迎。许多牧民家里，都已使用着崭新的铜壶、合金锅、铁火炉、洋磁的水桶等日常生活用具。牧民对草原上设立了国营商店和合作社特别感到满意。六十多岁的哈萨克牧民沙格特伯高兴地说：“国家能在深山草原上设立国营商店，从此我们再也不怕买不到东西和受商人的欺骗剥削了。”
