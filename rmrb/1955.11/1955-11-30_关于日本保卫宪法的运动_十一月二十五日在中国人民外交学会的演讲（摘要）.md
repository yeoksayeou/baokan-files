　　On the Movement to Defend the Constitution in Japan
　　——Speech at the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs on November 25 (Abstract)
　　Member of the Japanese "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution" Delegation to China
　　Dean of the Faculty of Law, Hosei University, Japan: Nakamura Tetsu

　　Tonight, I would like to talk about how the Japanese Constitution was formulated, how the United States instigated its revision, and how the Japanese people are defending the Constitution.

　　In the past, Japan was a totalitarian country. It was defeated in the war against the democratic countries, and the democratic countries demanded that Japan's constitution be formulated in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation. The Potsdam Proclamation required Japan to restore democracy and eliminate the forces that created the war. Therefore, after the war, to restore democracy according to the Potsdam Proclamation, the constitution should be revised. At that time, the Japanese government did not want to restore democracy according to the Potsdam Proclamation. If possible, it even wanted to maintain the old constitution with the Emperor as the center. However, the Allied countries wanted Japan to change it, so the Japanese government had to reluctantly accept and began to revise the constitution.

　　At that time, Japan was nominally under the control of the Allied countries, but in fact, it was under the control of the US occupation headquarters. Therefore, the revision of the constitution had to be approved by the United States. If Japan could propose a democratic draft, the United States would not prepare to propose its own draft. However, Japan proposed a relatively conservative draft constitution, so the United States proposed its own draft. It is said that the Japanese government was greatly alarmed after seeing the American draft, but if it did not accept this draft, China, India, and Australia might propose a draft to abolish the Emperor, so it accepted this draft.

　　The American draft was not the opinion of the United States alone. It was written in accordance with the Potsdam Proclamation and the opinions of the Allied countries, so it still contained some democratic elements. It stipulates the right to social survival, the right to education, the right to work, and the right to unity and action. These provisions are less capitalist and more socialist. At that time, the Japanese government did not accept it unchanged, and it was discussed in the Diet for one hundred days. The House of Representatives revised seven articles, and the House of Peers revised four articles and added some new articles. Although we civilian scholars and democratic parties were not satisfied with this constitution, it was still more progressive than the previous reactionary constitution, so we expressed our support.

　　This constitution has three characteristics: first, democracy; second, pacifism; third, internationalism – that is, friendly cooperation with all countries in the world. Pacifism is particularly embodied in Article 9 of the Constitution, which stipulates that Japan renounces war. This is the characteristic of the Japanese Constitution. The Japanese Constitution stipulates that it renounces any kind of war. This has two meanings: first, no matter what kind of international disputes occur, war should not be used to solve them, but negotiation should be used. Second, it does not possess land, sea, air, or any other war forces.

　　But soon, the Korean War broke out. The United States transferred the troops stationed in Japan to the Korean front and advocated that the defense of Japan should rely on its own army. Therefore, it trained a large number of police reserve forces, which were actually the army. We people believe that the Japanese Constitution prohibits armaments, and it is unconstitutional to engage in the army in the name of the police. I wrote articles in newspapers and magazines criticizing this, and we also expressed this view in the Diet debate. The Japanese Socialist Party and the Communist Party unanimously pointed out in the Diet that the government's rearmament violated the Constitution. The United States encountered great difficulties in Korea and suffered great sacrifices. Therefore, it wanted to set up the Japanese army in order to reduce American losses by using Asians to fight Asians. Therefore, the United States strengthened the police in Japan. The United States also believes that it is not good for the Japanese Constitution to stipulate that Japan is not allowed to fight, so it wants to revise it and promote it through conservative parties. The US-Japan Treaty of Peace was concluded in 1951. At the same time, the US-Japan Security Treaty was also concluded, allowing the United States to maintain military bases in Japan. The US-Japan Security Treaty also stipulates that if so-called domestic unrest or riots occur in Japan, the United States can dispatch its troops. Japanese trade unions and democrats believe that such a provision means that if the Japanese people rise up in revolution, the United States can send troops, which is clearly interference in internal affairs.

　　We believe that proposing to defend the peaceful constitution is the best way to launch a peace movement. We organized a "Society for the Protection of the Peaceful Constitution," which initially had ten members and has grown to its current scale. The central figure at that time was Tetsu Katayama. The process of its establishment was: Hachiro Arita (who had served as Foreign Minister four times) published a booklet entitled "Against War." We thought it was very good, so we invited him to give a speech, and thus the "Japan National Constitution Protection Research Association" was established. The members of the research association included people from political circles, scholars, cultural figures, religious figures, etc., including conservative people. Later, Minoru Takano, the leader of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), proposed to launch a united front in Japan, so the research association cooperated with Sohyo and expanded to trade unions. In this way, it developed into the current "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution." More than 110 organizations participate in this association, and they unanimously oppose amending the Constitution and have launched active activities.

　　Those who oppose us have put forward many reasons. The first reason is that the Constitution can be changed at any time, and if the Constitution has shortcomings, it should be changed. Our reply is that of course the Constitution has shortcomings, but the revision of the Constitution stems from the American request to rearm Japan, so we oppose it. Their second reason is that the original Constitution was formulated according to American instructions, and now that we are independent, we should revise it with our own Japanese hands. We believe that although the current Constitution is not as ideal, it is better to maintain the status quo than to change it for the worse. Their third reason is that the Constitution does not allow Japan to have an army, and foreign armies can invade, meaning China and the Soviet Union. We refute this in this way: First, socialist countries based on the working people will not invade people. This statement is generally accepted by people who understand socialism. Second, from a realistic point of view, Chinese politicians headed by Premier Zhou have all talked about that China does not adopt the policies they say. For those who do not understand socialism, we use this realistic policy to explain.

　　The Japanese Communist Party opposes rearmament. The Socialist Party participated in the election with the slogan "Young people, don't take up weapons." We are very worried that if the Constitution is revised in accordance with the American way, it will not produce an army to defend Japan. On the contrary, it will make Japan an aggressive army. They say that if you give up war, others will invade. The fact is that the United States has bases all over Japan. The total area of the bases accounts for one-fifth of the entire Japanese territory, about the size of Shikoku Island. If you want to talk about invasion, the United States is currently invading. The various democratic parties and trade unions in Japan are currently carrying out a movement against the expansion of American military bases.

　　The "National Federation for the Protection of the Constitution" opposes amending the Constitution, but the Japanese government is actually implementing it. Therefore, we must also oppose unconstitutional facts, such as rearmament and expansion of bases.

　　The amendment to the Constitution must be passed by a two-thirds majority in the Diet and must be approved by more than half of the national vote. To oppose the amendment, it is necessary to obtain more than one-third of the seats in the Diet. Currently, the number of seats held by the Japanese Socialist Party, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Communist Party in the Diet exceeds one-third, so it is impossible to amend it. The Socialist Party had differences of opinion when concluding the peace treaty and split into two. Recently, it has united due to a consensus on the movement to protect the Constitution. The conservative parties, the Liberal Party and the Democratic Party, are worried that the unified Socialist Party will become the largest party and seize power, so they have also merged.

　　关于日本保卫宪法的运动
　　——十一月二十五日在中国人民外交学会的演讲（摘要）
　　日本“拥护宪法国民联合会”访华团团员
　　日本法政大学法学院长　中村哲
    我今晚想谈一谈，日本宪法过去是如何制定的，美国如何鼓动修改宪法，日本人民如何保卫宪法。
    过去日本是极权主义国家，它在同民主国家的战争中被打败了，民主国家要求按波茨坦公告来制定日本的宪法。波茨坦公告要日本恢复民主，消灭制造战争的力量。因此在战后，要按波茨坦公告恢复民主，就应修改宪法。当时日本政府并不想按波茨坦公告恢复民主，可能的话，还想以天皇为中心，保持旧宪法。但同盟国要日本改，因此日本政府只得勉强接受，开始着手改正宪法。
    当时日本名义上是在同盟国的管制下，事实上是在美国占领军司令部的管制下，因此修改宪法必须要得到美国的批准。如果日本能提出一个民主的草案，美国是不预备提出它的草案来的。但日本却提出了一个比较保守的宪法草案，因此美国就提出了它的草案。据说日本政府看到美国的草案之后，大为惊慌，但如果不接受这个草案，中国、印度和澳大利亚等可能还要提出一个废除天皇的草案来，因此接受了这个草案。
    美国的草案也不是美国一国的意见，它是按照波茨坦公告和同盟国家的意见写出的，因此还有些民主成份在内。它规定有社会生存的权利，受教育的权利，劳动的权利，团结和行动的权利。这些规定，与其说是资本主义的成份，还不如说是社会主义的成份。当时日本政府，并没有原封不动地接受，在国会进行了一百天的讨论，众议院修改了七条，贵族院修改了四条，又添了些新条文。我们这些民间学者和民主党派团体，虽然对这个宪法并不满意，但较之以前反动的宪法还是比较进步的，因此表示拥护。
    这个宪法有三个特色：一，民主主义；二，和平主义；三，国际主义——即和世界各国友好合作。和平主义特别体现在宪法第九条，这条规定日本放弃战争，这是日本宪法的特征。日本宪法规定放弃任何种类的战争。这有两层意思：一、不论国际发生何种纷争，不用战争来解决，而应用协商的方法来解决。二、不具有陆海空和其他任何战争力量。
    但不久，发生了朝鲜战争。美国把驻在日本的军队调到了朝鲜前线，主张保卫日本要靠日本自己的军队，因此训练了大批警察预备队，事实上就是军队。我们这些人认为，日本宪法禁止军备，以警察为名搞军队是违反宪法的。我在报纸杂志上写文抨击，在国会辩论中，我们也发表了这种主张。日本社会党和共产党在国会一致指出政府重新武装违背宪法。美国在朝鲜遇到了很大的难关，牺牲很大，因此想搞起日本军队，以便用亚洲人打亚洲人的办法，来减少美国的损失。因此美国在日本加强警察。美国并认为日本宪法规定日本不准打仗很不好，因此要加修改，并通过保守的政党来宣传。美日和约是在一九五一年缔结的，与此同时，又缔结了日美安全条约，使美国在日本可以保有军事基地。美日安全条约并规定，如日本国内发生所谓内乱、骚动，美国可以出动其军队。日本工会和民主人士都认为这样的规定就是说，如果日本人民自己起来革命，美国即可出动军队，这显然是干涉内政。
    我们认为提出保卫和平的宪法是展开和平运动的最好的方法。我们组织了一个“拥护和平宪法会”，最初有十个人参加，一直发展到现在的规模，当时中心人物是片山哲。成立的经过是：有田八郎（当过四次外务相）发表了一本小册子题为“反对战争”，我们觉得很好，就请他来演讲，因之就成立了“日本国民拥护宪法研究会”。研究会的成员包括有政界、学者、文化人、宗教家等，其中包括保守的人士。后来日本总评的领导人高野实又提议在日本展开统一战线，因此研究会又和总评合作，扩大到了工会。这样就发展成为现在的“拥护宪法国民联合会”。参加这个会的有一百十几个团体，它们一致反对修改宪法，展开了积极的活动。
    反对我们的人提出了很多理由。第一个理由是，宪法是随时可以变更的，宪法有缺点就应该改。我们的答复是，当然宪法有缺点，但修改宪法出于美国要重新武装日本的要求，因此我们反对。他们第二个理由是，原来的宪法是按美国的指示制定的，现在我们已独立，应该用日本人自己的手改过来。我们认为，目前的宪法虽不如理想，但与其改坏，不如维持现状。他们第三个理由是，宪法不许日本有军队，外国军队可以来侵略，他们的意思是指中国和苏联。我们是这样反驳的：一、以劳动人民为基础的社会主义国家不会侵略人。这个说法，一般对社会主义有理解的人都能接受。二、从现实看，以周总理为首的中国政治家们都谈到，中国并不采取他们所说的那样的政策。对一般不理解社会主义的人就用这个现实政策来解释。
    日本共产党反对重新武装。社会党以“青年们，你们不要拿武器”的口号来参加竞选。我们很担心，如果按照美国的方式来修改宪法，并不能产生保卫日本的军队，相反的是使日本形成侵略性军队。他们说，如果放弃了战争，别人就要来侵略。事实是，美国在日本遍布基地，基地的总面积占全日本领土的五分之一，约有一个四国岛那末大，要说侵略，目前就是美国在侵略。日本各民主党派、工会目前就在进行反对美国扩大军事基地的运动。
  “拥护宪法国民联合会”反对修改宪法，但日本政府事实上已在那里实行。因此，对于违宪的事实，如重新武装、扩大基地等，我们也要反对。
    修改宪法须国会三分之二多数通过，还要经过国民投票过半数赞成才成立。要反对修改须取得国会三分之一以上的议席。目前日本社会党、劳农党和共产党在国会的议席，超过三分之一，因此不可能修改。社会党在缔结和约时意见分歧，分裂为二，最近因在拥护宪法运动上意见一致，已统一起来。保守的党派自由党和民主党，担心统一的社会党会变成第一大党，掌握政权，因此也合并了。
