　　American Military Bases in Japan
    American military bases in Japan were gradually occupied and established by the U.S. military after the occupation of Japan. Through the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" of September 1951 and the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement" of February 1952, the United States forced Japan to grant it the privilege of stationing troops and occupying military bases in Japan indefinitely. In July 1952, the United States signed the so-called "Facilities and Areas Agreement" with the Japanese authorities, making this privilege concrete.
    According to materials published by Japanese newspapers, the United States then occupied more than 600 military bases in Japan, including barracks, airfields, naval facilities, warehouses, and military training grounds, of which about 300 were designated for indefinite use by the U.S. military. In addition, U.S. troops stationed in Japan occupied 671 private residences for exclusive use, as well as many secret communication facilities, intelligence agencies, radar bases, and so on.
    Since then, the United States has continued to increase and expand its military bases in Japan. According to statistics published by the Japanese magazine "Economist," from the signing of the U.S.-Japan "Facilities and Areas Agreement" to April 1, 1954, the United States added more than 20 bases for indefinite use; during the same period, the U.S. military authorities made 66 requests to expand bases. Recently, the United States has again driven the Japanese authorities to take measures such as forcibly purchasing and requisitioning land, and using force to suppress residents, in order to expand many U.S. military bases, especially at air force bases in Tachikawa, Yokota, Kisarazu, Komaki, Niigata, and Itazuke.
    These American military bases are distributed throughout Japan, from Hokkaido to Kyushu, controlling all key areas. For example, in the Tokyo-Yokohama area, there are more than 70 bases for permanent use by the U.S. military; there are more than 30 similar bases in the Kyoto-Osaka-Kobe area. All of Japan's important airfields and famous naval ports such as Yokosuka and Sasebo have now become American military bases.
    According to materials recently published by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the total area occupied by these American military bases is equivalent to the size of Shikoku Island, one of Japan's main islands (about 18,000 square kilometers). But the United States wants more. Fukushima Shintaro, Director-General of the Japan Procurement Agency, said in the Japanese Senate not long ago that the United States had asked the Japanese government to give it another 377,300 acres of land in order to expand U.S. military training grounds and air force bases; this land alone amounts to about 2.34 million mu, exceeding the total cultivated land area of the three prefectures of Kyoto, Osaka, and Nara in Japan.
    According to a survey by the Japanese Fisheries Agency, the area of Japanese fishing grounds designated by the U.S. military as maritime training grounds is 48,000 square kilometers, which is about the size of Kyushu Island. More than 89,000 Japanese fishermen have suffered losses due to the ban on fishing.
    According to the provisions of the "U.S.-Japan Administrative Agreement," the United States has obtained all powers and rights to manage and use these base areas, and has the right to "easy access" in neighboring areas; Japan has no right to use these bases and facilities, and in many places, Japanese people are even prohibited from entering. However, Japan has to pay huge "defense burden-sharing fees" every year to support the American occupation army and facilitate the United States in maintaining and expanding these bases. In these base areas and their vicinity, the U.S. authorities have the "right to arrest" and the "right to judge" Japanese people; Americans, not only are not subject to Japanese law within these areas, but can also enter and leave the entire Japanese territory in the name of military personnel, civilian personnel, or their families, and "Japanese laws on passports and certificates" and "Japanese laws on foreign registration and management" "do not apply." The agreement also stipulates that Japan cannot tax or inspect all goods and mail transported in and out by the United States in the name of military use or use by military personnel and their families. Because of this, these bases have actually become hundreds of U.S. concessions in Japan, and are centers that facilitate Americans' smuggling, crime, rampant lawlessness, and demoralization. For example, Americans openly sell tax-free imported goods in Japan in the name of auctioning "surplus military supplies." According to Kyodo News, in the ten months from October 1953 to August 1954, American soldiers and civilian personnel committed more than 5,000 cases of murder, robbery, theft, and rape in Japan, but only 100 cases were prosecuted. Chitose in Hokkaido was originally a town with a population of less than 10,000, but after becoming an American military base, it increased by 1,000 American soldiers who "patronize prostitutes" and 1,000 "hostesses."
    These military bases are the center of U.S. activities to create war in the Far East. The U.S. Far East Command and the headquarters of the U.S. military invading Korea are located in Japan. During the Korean War, the United States used Japanese bases to concentrate, dispatch, and reorganize troops, and directly dispatched aircraft from Japanese airfields to massacre the peaceful people of Korea. Many of the special agents and spies that the United States airdropped into our country were also trained at Japanese bases and took off from Japan. Recently, the United States has openly transported atomic cannons to Japan and conducted exercises in Japan, attempting to drag Japan into the disaster of an atomic war.
    American military bases in Japan threaten peace in the Far East and infringe upon Japan's sovereignty and independence. Therefore, the Japanese people have been waging a wide and resolute struggle against American military bases for several years. (Ping)

### 美国在日本的军事基地

　　美国在日本的军事基地
    美国在日本的军事基地，是美国军队占领日本以来陆续占有和设置的。通过一九五一年九月的“美日安全条约”和一九五二年二月的“美日行政协定”，美国强使日本给予它无限期地在日本驻扎军队和占有军事基地的特权。一九五二年七月，美国又同日本当局签订了所谓“设施与区域协定”，使得这种特权具体化。
    据日本报纸公布的材料，当时美国在日本共占有兵营、飞机场、海军设施、仓库和军事演习场等军事基地共六百多处，其中约三百处被规定是由美军无限期使用的。此外，驻日美军并占有专用的个人住宅六百七十一处，还有许多秘密的通讯设施、情报机构、雷达基地等。
    在此以后，美国仍在日本不断地增加和扩大军事基地。据日本“经济学人”杂志发表的统计，从美日“设施与区域协定”签订后，到一九五四年四月一日为止，美国占有的无限期使用基地又增加了二十余处；同一期间，美军当局提出了六十六件扩大基地的要求。最近，美国又驱使日本当局采取强购、强征土地以及用武力镇压居民等手段来扩大许多美军基地，特别是在立川、横田、木更津、小牧、新潟、板付等处的空军基地。
    这些美国军事基地，分布在从北海道到九州的日本全境，控制着所有要害地区。例如在东京——横滨地区，就有美军永久使用的基地七十多处；同类的基地在京都——大阪——神户地区有三十多处。日本的所有重要飞机场和横须贺、佐世保等著名军港，现在都变成了美国的军事基地。
    据日本工会总评议会最近发表的材料，这些美国军事基地所占的总面积，相当于日本主要岛屿之一的四国岛那么大（约一万八千平方公里）。但美国还要得更多。日本调达厅长官福岛慎太郎不久前在日本参议院说，美国要求日本政府再给它土地三十七万七千三百英亩，以便扩大美国军事演习场和空军基地；单只这项土地，就约合二百三十四万华亩，超过了日本的京都、大阪、奈良三个府县耕地面积的总和。
    又据日本水产厅的调查，日本渔场被美军划作海上演习场的面积达四万八千平方公里，约等于九州岛的面积，由于禁止捕鱼而受到损失的日本渔民有八万九千多人。
    依照“美日行政协定”的规定，美国取得了管理和使用这些基地区域的一切权力和权利，并在邻近地区有“出入方便”之权；日本无权使用这些基地和设施，许多地方甚至禁止日本人入内，但日本每年要缴付巨额的“防卫分担费”，以供养美国占领军和便利美国维持和扩充这些基地。美国当局在这些基地区域及其近旁，对日本人有“逮捕权”和“裁判权”；美国人则不但在这些区域以内不受日本法律管辖，而且还能以军事人员、文职人员或其家属的名义出入整个日本国境也“不适用日本的护照及证明的法令”，“不适用日本国的外人登记与管理的法令”。协定还规定，美国以军队公用或军队人员和家属使用的名义运进运出的一切货物和邮件，日本不能征税也无权检查。由于这样，这些基地实际上变成了美国在日本的几百处租界，并且是便利美国人走私、犯罪、横行不法和伤风败俗的中心。例如，美国人以拍卖“剩余军用物资”的名义，公开在日本抛售免税输入的商品。据共同社报道，在一九五三年十月到一九五四年八月的十个多月中，美国军人和文职人员在日本犯杀人、抢劫、偷窃、强奸等罪的案件达五千多起，但被起诉的只有一百件。北海道的千岁原来是人口不到一万的乡镇，但在变成美国军事基地后，竟增加了美国军人的“包娼”一千人和“女招待”一千人。
    这些军事基地，是美国在远东制造战争的活动的中枢。远东美军总司令部和侵朝美军总部就设在日本。在朝鲜战争期间，美国曾利用日本的基地来集中、调遣和整休部队，并直接从日本的飞机场派遣飞机来屠杀朝鲜的和平人民。美国空投到我国境内的特务间谍，也有许多是在日本基地训练和从日本起飞的。最近，美国又公开把原子炮运到日本，并在日本进行演习，企图把日本拖入一场原子战争的灾难中去。
    美国在日本的军事基地威胁着远东的和平，侵犯日本的主权和独立。因此日本人民几年来一直为反对美国军事基地进行着广泛和坚决的斗争。（平）
