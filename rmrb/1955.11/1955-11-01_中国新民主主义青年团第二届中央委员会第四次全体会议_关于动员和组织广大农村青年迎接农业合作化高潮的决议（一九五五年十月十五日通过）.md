    I
    Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the question of agricultural cooperation have summarized the experience of China's agricultural cooperation movement and made comprehensive plans for the future development of agricultural cooperation. The Youth League should mobilize the youth of the whole country to work with the peasants of the whole country to realize our Party's great program of socialist transformation of agriculture, so that our 500 million peasants can embark on the broad road of socialism, and powerfully promote our great cause of socialist construction.

    The broad masses of rural youth, especially the Youth League members, warmly welcome and actively participate in the cause of agricultural cooperation. They have increasingly shown themselves to be the most active force in the socialist mass movement in the countryside. The organizations of the Youth League at all levels, especially the grassroots organizations of the Youth League in rural areas, have also achieved considerable success and experience in mobilizing and organizing rural League members and youth to participate in the cooperative movement and assisting the Party in running cooperatives well. However, many comrades in the League still lack a complete and profound understanding of the Party's general line, their understanding of the principles and policies of the socialist transformation of agriculture is not clear enough, and they often underestimate the enthusiasm of the broad masses of youth to take the socialist road. In practical work, we have not fully guided and brought into play the enthusiasm of the youth. In some places, there have even been erroneous behaviors that restrict youth from joining or establishing cooperatives. All these indicate that the guidance of our many Youth League committees on cooperative work is lagging behind the mass movement.

    The Party Central Committee pointed out in its resolution on the question of agricultural cooperation that both the work of establishing cooperatives and the work of consolidating cooperatives must rely on the organizations of the Party and the Youth League. That is to say, in the great and arduous historical task of realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture, our Party requires the Youth League to act as a loyal and active assistant of the Party. Therefore, the Youth League committees at all levels must, under the unified planning and unified deployment of the Party committees at the same level, earnestly improve their leadership over rural work, resolutely take agricultural cooperation as the center of all work in the countryside, and must, with a positive and active spirit, boldly organize and bring into play the enthusiasm of young people in building socialism, so that young people can truly become a shock force in the cause of agricultural cooperation, and strive to build a new socialist countryside.

    II

    In order to assist the Party in successfully carrying out the socialist transformation of agriculture, it is necessary first to arm the minds of the entire League and the broad masses of youth with the Party's principles and policies on the agricultural cooperation movement, and to continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the youth through practical movements.

    At present, the Youth League committees at all levels should organize all League cadres, all League members and the broad masses of youth to earnestly study Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperation, study the Party Central Committee's resolution on the question of agricultural cooperation, and study the "Model Regulations for Agricultural Production Cooperatives" that will be promulgated soon. Through this large-scale study and publicity activity, everyone from the cadres of the Youth League committees at all levels to the grassroots organizations of the League, from all League members to the broad masses of youth, from rural youth to urban youth, will receive the most profound education.

    First, all League members and the broad masses of youth must understand the great significance of China's agricultural cooperation: only by accelerating agricultural cooperation can we support and promote the development of China's socialist industry and make the worker-peasant alliance obtain a new and solid foundation; only then can the broad masses of peasants finally get rid of poverty, get rid of the threat of capitalism, and embark on the road to common prosperity; only then can we continuously promote the political, economic, cultural, health and other aspects of work in the countryside, and build a new socialist countryside.

    Second, all League members and the broad masses of youth must understand the basic policies for establishing and consolidating cooperatives: only by firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants while consolidating the unity of all middle peasants, only by consistently adhering to the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, and only by implementing comprehensive planning and establishing cooperatives in stages and batches can we ensure the healthy development of the agricultural cooperation movement.

    Third, all League members and the broad masses of youth must understand that realizing agricultural cooperation is a serious struggle: we must carry forward the spirit of communism to overcome various capitalist tendencies, we must use heroic model behaviors to overcome the various difficulties that we are bound to encounter, we must adopt the method of patient persuasion to promote the advancement of backward people, and we must wage a relentless struggle against counter-revolutionary sabotage activities with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and revolutionary responsibility.

    It should be emphasized that studying and publicizing the question of agricultural cooperation is a long-term and regular task. In addition to carrying out publicity through various meetings and newspapers and periodicals, the Youth League committees at all levels must also, with the development of agricultural cooperation, promptly summarize and disseminate the experiences of advanced regions and advanced units, and repeatedly conduct education in light of the new ideological situation of League members and youth.

    III

    Fully organizing and bringing into play the labor enthusiasm of the youth, and continuously improving the production technology of both male and female youth, are important conditions for consolidating cooperatives and a fundamental method of carrying out communist education among youth.

    After a large number of cooperatives are established this winter, the League organizations in various localities should, according to local conditions, launch various activities to develop production, especially activities such as maintaining livestock, increasing fertilizer accumulation, repairing land, building water conservancy projects, and selecting and collecting fine varieties. During the spring plowing next year, the League organizations in various localities should launch various competition activities to increase production, such as deep plowing and fine cultivation, prevention and control of diseases and pests, planting of high-yield crops, afforestation, and organizing small-scale land reclamation in close proximity.

    Over the past year or so, many places have organized youth shock brigades, youth production teams, and youth planting groups under the unified planning of the cooperatives. Experience has proved that these teams and groups have played a significant role in taking the lead in overcoming difficulties, implementing technological improvements, improving labor productivity, and cultivating the socialist labor attitude of the broad masses of youth. The Youth League committees at all levels must care for these organizations, not only to ensure that the youth participating in these organizations receive reasonable remuneration and appropriate rewards in order to promote their enthusiasm, but also to constantly strengthen their education to prevent them from becoming detached from the masses due to pride and complacency.

    Universally calling on youth to strive to be excellent cooperative members, vigorously organizing youth to put forward rationalization proposals, and organizing youth inspection groups by cooperative unit can greatly enhance the youth's enthusiasm for loving the cooperative and enable the cooperative's business management to be continuously improved. The Youth League committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership in this regard.

    Organizing youth to learn from old peasants and inherit the rich harvest experience of the older generation; organizing youth technology learning groups, signing contracts with agricultural technology agencies to teach and learn, and accepting new scientific and technological knowledge are two ways to educate both male and female youth to improve their farming techniques. The Youth League committees at all levels must also strengthen their leadership.

    IV

    The large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives requires a large number of cooperative management cadres. The League organizations should proactively and systematically assist the Party in cultivating a large number of technical and management personnel.

    The League's task in this regard should focus on cultivating accountants, technicians, feeders, farm implement workers, production team leaders, and technical crop planting group leaders. In order to meet the needs of the national plan for the development of agricultural production cooperatives before the spring of 1958, during this period, the country should cultivate 2 million accountants, 3 million farm implement workers, 1.5 million technicians, and 500,000 feeders from among the youth. The Youth League committees of various provinces, prefectures, and counties should formulate specific training plans based on the local cooperative development plans, select outstanding League members and youth activists to participate in various training courses organized by the government, strengthen their political and ideological work and learning guidance work, so that they can truly undertake these work tasks.

    At present, in culturally underdeveloped areas, especially mountainous areas, there is a shortage of cooperative accountants and other technical personnel with a certain level of education. The Youth League committees of various provinces and cities should, according to needs, mobilize a group of primary and junior high school graduates from cities to go to those places to participate in the cooperative movement. When these young people consciously accept this glorious task, they should be fully informed of the various difficulties so that they can make the greatest determination to serve the peasants in those places for a long time.

    V

    The phenomenon of a large number of illiterates in the countryside left over from the old China seriously hinders the progress of the peasants and is also a difficulty in developing agricultural cooperation. With the advancement of agricultural cooperation, the broad masses of peasants, especially the youth, are increasingly eager to learn culture. In the agricultural cooperation movement, the organizations of the Youth League must regard eliminating illiteracy as an extremely important task.

    Based on the various aspects of the rural situation, it is entirely possible to basically eliminate illiteracy among rural youth before 1962, that is, to enable 80% of rural youth to recognize more than 1,000 characters. The Youth League committees at all levels should, in accordance with this general requirement, coordinate with the government's education departments to formulate a long-term plan for eliminating illiteracy in their provinces, counties, and townships, and specific arrangements for each year, mobilize more than 5 million primary and junior high school graduates and more than 30 million young people who have already gotten rid of illiteracy in rural areas, form a large army of literacy, and use learning forms such as year-round people's schools, literacy groups, and work-point literacy classes to carry out the work of eliminating illiteracy. The Youth League county committees should coordinate with the government's education departments to hold a meeting of literacy cadres and activists once a year to review the educational achievements of the previous year, stipulate the task of eliminating illiteracy for the next year, promote the experiences of advanced units, and commend teaching models, learning models, and school-running models. In the autumn of 1956, the Central Committee of the Youth League and the Ministry of Education will jointly convene a national conference of literacy activists in order to launch a large-scale mass movement to eliminate illiteracy.

    For young people who are already literate, in addition to establishing advanced classes for people's schools as much as possible, it is also necessary to vigorously organize them to read popular books and newspapers in order to consolidate their literacy achievements and continue to improve their cultural level. Before 1957, the vast majority of rural villages across the country should rely on the strength of the youth masses themselves to establish and run a library well. The Youth League committees of counties and districts should also actively cooperate with the postal and telecommunications and transportation departments to universally establish township volunteer post offices in a planned way, and rely on youth activists to do a good job in the publicity, subscription and delivery of newspapers and periodicals.

    VI

    The Party Central Committee pointed out in its resolution on the question of agricultural cooperation: "Strengthening the Party and Youth League branches is the key to running cooperatives well." At present, the rural Youth League organizations, whether in terms of the organizational leadership of the branches, or in terms of the quantity and quality of the League members, cannot keep up with the requirements of cooperative development. We must carry out the building and consolidation of the League in conjunction with the establishment and consolidation of cooperatives and the building and consolidation of the Party. The building and consolidation of the League must achieve these three goals: strengthening the leadership core of the grassroots organizations, improving the quality of the League, and absorbing new activists into the League.

    First, in order to strengthen the leadership core of the grassroots organizations of the League, it must be ensured that there are no class alien elements and long-term passive and sluggish elements in the grassroots leadership backbone; the system of regular re-election must be strictly implemented to ensure that the leadership core of the branches is composed of loyal, capable and active elements within the League.

    Second, in order to improve the quality of the League, it is necessary to improve the organizational life of the League, establish a regular learning system for branches and groups to continuously enhance the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of League members; it is necessary to develop the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism within the League, and overcome various erroneous ideas and behaviors within the League in a timely manner; it is necessary to purge the extremely small number of counter-revolutionary elements, class alien elements and degenerate elements who have infiltrated the League in order to maintain the purity of the League's organization.

    Third, in order to absorb new activists into the League, it is necessary to attach importance to the emerging forces that have emerged with the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, especially the emerging forces that have emerged from among the poor and lower-middle peasants; it is necessary to absorb those emerging forces, especially the emerging forces from among the poor and lower-middle peasants, into the League in batches, in accordance with the conditions for joining the League stipulated in the League Constitution, and after examination. We should strive to develop the number of League members in rural areas across the country to about 20 million by the end of 1957. According to this general requirement, the Youth League committees of various provinces should formulate their own phased development plans, and check them frequently to ensure both quality and quantity.

    The plans for building and consolidating the League of the Youth League committees at all levels should be approved by the Party committees and included in the Party committees' plans for cooperative planning and Party building and consolidation, and implemented actively and with leadership.

    VII

    In the vigorous socialist transformation movement of agriculture, the Youth League committees at all levels must earnestly improve their leadership over rural work. The rural League cadres must delve into the work of the cooperative in a down-to-earth manner and turn themselves into experts. The Youth League committees at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels, on the one hand, must go deep into reality, conduct typical investigations and research, and provide specific guidance and assistance to the grassroots organizations; on the other hand, they must convene some professional and mass meetings frequently in a planned and prepared manner, combining the work of organizing learning, mobilizing the masses, finding models, training cadres, summarizing experiences, and formulating plans.

    The great socialist transformation movement of agriculture is a good opportunity for us to learn how to build socialism. We must strive to cultivate ourselves into experienced and capable people in this movement. We must rely closely on the leadership of the Party and learn from the masses with humility. As long as we can use an active, enthusiastic, happy, welcoming, and all-out spirit to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broadest masses of youth to build socialism, we will certainly be able to fulfill our glorious responsibility in assisting the Party to victoriously complete the historical task of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    中国新民主主义青年团第二届中央委员会第四次全体会议
    关于动员和组织广大农村青年迎接农业合作化高潮的决议
    （一九五五年十月十五日通过）
    一
    毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党第七届中央委员会第六次全体会议（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，总结了我国农业合作化运动的经验，为今后农业合作化的发展作了全面的规划。青年团应当动员全国青年，同全国农民一道为实现我们党的这个农业的社会主义改造的伟大纲领而奋斗，使我国五万万农民走上社会主义的康庄大道，有力地推进我国伟大的社会主义建设事业。
    农村中的广大青年，首先是青年团员，对于农业合作化的事业是热烈欢迎和积极参加的。他们已日益表现出自己是农村中社会主义群众运动的一支最活跃的力量。各级团的组织，特别是农村团的基层组织，在动员和组织农村团员和青年参加合作化运动、协助党办好合作社的工作中，也已经取得不少成绩和经验。但是，团内有许多同志对党的总路线还缺乏完整的深刻的理解，对农业的社会主义改造的方针政策还认识得不够明确，对广大青年要求走社会主义道路的劲头也往往估计不足。在实际工作中，我们还没有充分地去引导和发挥青年的积极性。有些地方甚至还发生过限制青年入社、办社的错误行为。这些，都说明了我们许多团委对合作化工作的指导是落在群众运动的后头的。
    党中央在关于农业合作化问题的决议中指出，建社工作和整社工作都要依靠党和青年团的组织。这就是说，在实现农业的社会主义改造这个伟大而艰巨的历史任务中，我们的党要求青年团充当党的忠实的积极的助手。因而各级团委必须在同级党委的统一规划和统一部署下，切实地改进自己对农村工作的领导，坚决地把农业合作化作为在农村中进行一切工作的中心；必须以积极主动的精神，放手地组织和发挥青年人建设社会主义的积极性，使青年真正成为农业合作化事业中的一支突击队伍，为建设社会主义的新农村而努力奋斗。
    二
    为了协助党胜利地进行农业的社会主义改造，必须首先用党的关于农业合作化运动的方针政策把全团和广大青年的头脑武装起来，并且通过实际运动不断地提高青年的社会主义觉悟。
    在目前，各级团委都应当组织全团干部、全体团员和广大青年认真学习毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，学习党中央关于农业合作化问题的决议，学习即将颁布的“农业生产合作社示范章程”。通过这次大规模的学习和宣传活动，做到从各级团委干部到团的基层组织，从全体团员到广大青年，从农村青年到城市青年，都受到一次最深刻的教育。
    第一要使全体团员和广大青年认清我国农业合作化的伟大意义：只有加速农业合作化，才能支援和促进我国社会主义工业的发展，使工农联盟获得新的稳固的基础；才能使广大农民最后脱离贫困状况，摆脱资本主义的威胁，走上共同富裕的境地；才能不断地推进农村的政治、经济、文化、卫生等各方面的工作，建成社会主义的新的农村。
    第二要使全体团员和广大青年懂得建社和整社的基本政策：只有牢固地依靠贫农和下中农同时又巩固地团结全体中农，只有一贯地坚持自愿互利的原则，只有实行全面规划分期分批地建社，才能保证农业合作化运动健康地向前发展。
    第三要使全体团员和广大青年懂得实现农业合作化是一场严重的斗争：必须发扬共产主义的精神去战胜各种资本主义的倾向，必须用英勇的模范行为去克服必然要遇到的各种困难，必须采取耐心说服的方法去推动落后的人们前进，必须以高度的革命警惕性和革命责任感同反革命的破坏活动作无情的斗争。
    应该着重指出，学习和宣传农业合作化问题是一个长期的经常工作。各级团委除了通过各种会议和报纸刊物进行宣传外，还必须随着农业合作化的发展，及时地总结和传播先进地区和先进单位的经验，并且针对团员和青年的新的思想情况反复地进行教育。三
    充分地组织和发挥青年的劳动热情，不断地提高男女青年的生产技术，这是巩固合作社的重要条件，也是对青年进行共产主义教育的根本方法。
    在今年冬季大批合作社建立起来之后，各地团的组织都应当根据本地情况，发动广大青年展开各种发展生产的活动，特别是保养牲畜、增积肥料、整修土地、兴修水利、选留和采集优良品种等活动。在明年春耕的时候，各地团的组织都应当发动广大青年展开各种增加生产的竞赛活动，例如深耕细作、防治病害虫害、种植高产作物、植树造林以及组织近距离的小型开荒等。
    一年多来，许多地方在合作社的统一规划下，组织了青年突击队、青年生产队和青年种植小组。经验证明，这些队和组在带头克服困难、实行技术改良、提高劳动生产率和培养广大青年的社会主义劳动态度等方面，都起了显著的作用。各级团委必须关怀这些组织，既要使参加这些组织的青年得到合理的报酬和恰当的奖励，以发扬他们的积极性；又要经常地加强对他们的教育，防止他们因骄傲自满而脱离群众。
    普遍号召青年争取做一个优秀社员，大力组织青年提合理化建议，以及以社为单位组织青年检查小组，都能够大大提高青年的爱社热情，使合作社的经营管理得到不断的改进，各级团委必须加以很好的领导。
    组织青年向老农学习，把老一辈的丰产经验继承下来；组织青年技术学习小组，同农业技术机关订立包教包学合同，接受新的科学技术知识，这是教育男女青年提高耕作技术的两个途径。各级团委也必须加强领导。
    四
    农业生产合作社的大量发展，需要大批的办社骨干。团的组织应当主动地、有计划地协助党培养出大量的技术人员和管理人员来。
    团在这方面的任务，应当着重培养会计员、技术员、饲养员、农具手、生产队长和技术作物种植小组长。为了适应全国在一九五八年春季以前农业生产合作社的发展计划的需要，在这个时期内，全国应当从青年中培养出会计员二百万人，农具手三百万人，技术员一百五十万人，饲养员五十万人。各省、地、县团委都应当根据本地合作化的发展计划，具体订出培养计划，选派优秀团员和青年积极分子参加政府举办的各种训练班进行学习，加强对他们的政治思想工作和学习辅导工作，使他们确实能够承担这些工作任务。
    目前在文化不发达的地区，特别是山区，缺少具有一定文化程度的合作社的会计和其他技术人员。各省市团委应当根据需要，从城市中动员一批高小和初中毕业学生到那些地方去参加合作化运动。当这些青年自觉地接受这个光荣任务的时候，应当充分地向他们讲明各种困难，使他们能够下定最大的决心，长期地为那些地方的农民服务。
    五
    由旧中国所遗留下来的农村大量文盲存在的现象，严重地妨害着农民的进步，也是发展农业合作化的一个困难。随着农业合作化的向前发展，广大农民群众，特别是青年群众日益迫切地要求学习文化。在农业合作化运动中，青年团的组织必须把扫除文盲当作一项极为重要的任务。
    根据农村各方面的情况，在一九六二年以前，基本扫除农村青年中的文盲，就是使百分之八十的农村青年都能够认识一千个字以上，这是完全可能的。各级团委应当按照这个总的要求，协同政府的教育部门订出本省、本县、本乡的扫除文盲的远景计划和每年的具体部署，动员农村中五百多万高小、初中毕业生和三千多万已经摆脱了文盲状态的青年，组成扫盲大军，运用常年民校、识字小组、记工识字班等学习形式来开展扫除文盲的工作。团的县委应当协同政府的教育部门，每年举行一次扫盲干部会议和积极分子会议，检查上年度的教育成果，规定下年度的扫除文盲的任务，推广先进单位的经验，表扬教学模范、学习模范和办学模范。在一九五六年秋季，团中央和教育部将联合召开一次全国扫盲积极分子会议，以便掀起一个大规模的扫除文盲的群众运动。
    对于已经识字的青年，除了应当尽可能创办民校高级班外，还必须大力组织他们阅读通俗书报，以便巩固他们的扫盲成果，继续提高他们的文化水平。在一九五七年以前，全国绝大部分乡村都应当依靠青年群众自己的力量，建立和办好一个图书室。县区团委还要积极配合邮电和交通部门有步骤地把乡的义务邮站普遍地建立起来，依靠青年积极分子做好报刊的宣传、收订和传递工作。
    六
    党中央在关于农业合作化问题的决议中指出：“健全党和青年团的支部，是办好合作社的关键。”目前，农村青年团组织不论在支部的组织领导上，在团员的数量和质量上，都赶不上合作化发展的要求。我们必须结合着建社整社和建党整党进行建团整团。建团整团必须达到这样三个目的：加强基层组织领导核心，提高团的质量和吸收新的积极分子入团。
    第一，为了加强团的基层组织的领导核心，必须做到使基层领导骨干中没有阶级异己分子和长期的消极怠工分子；必须严格执行定期改选的制度，保证支部的领导核心由团内忠实的能干的积极分子所组成。
    第二，为了提高团的质量，必须健全团的组织生活，建立支部和小组经常的学习制度，以不断增强广大团员的社会主义觉悟；必须发展团内批评和自我批评的风气，及时克服团内的各种错误思想和错误行为；必须把极少数混入团内的反革命分子、阶级异己分子和蜕化分子清洗出去，以保持团的组织上的纯洁。
    第三，为了吸收新的积极分子入团，必须重视随着农业合作化运动发展所涌现出来的新生力量，特别是从贫农和下中农中间所涌现出来的新生力量；必须按照团章所规定的入团条件，并且经过审查，把那些新生力量，特别是贫农和下中农中间的新生力量，一批一批地吸收到团内来。我们应当争取到一九五七年底，把全国农村中的团员发展到两千万左右。根据这个总的要求，各省团委应当订出自己分期分批的发展计划，并且勤加检查，以保证质量又保证数量。
    各级团委的建团整团计划，都应当经过党委的批准，包括在党委对合作化的规划和建党整党的计划之内，积极地有领导地贯彻执行。
    七
    在蓬蓬勃勃发展的农业社会主义改造运动中，各级团委都必须切实改进自己对农村工作的领导。农村团的干部对合作社的工作都必须扎扎实实地钻进去，把自己变成内行。省、地、县三级团委，一方面要深入实际，进行典型的调查研究，对基层组织进行具体的指导和帮助；另一方面要有计划有准备地经常召开一些专业性群众性的会议，把组织学习，发动群众，寻找典型，培养干部，总结经验，制订计划等工作结合起来。
    伟大的农业社会主义改造运动是我们学习建设社会主义的良好机会。我们一定要在这个运动中，努力把自己培养成为有经验有办法的人。我们必须紧紧地依靠党的领导，虚心地向群众学习。只要我们能够用主动的、积极的、高兴的、欢迎的、全力以赴的精神，把最广大的青年群众建设社会主义的积极性发动起来，我们就一定能够在协助党胜利地完成农业的社会主义改造的历史任务中，尽到自己的光荣的责任。
