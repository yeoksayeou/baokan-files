Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 1st: According to TASS, the Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States held their fourth meeting on October 31st, with Dulles as chairman.

    According to the decision of the previous meeting, the meeting began by discussing the third item on the agenda—the issue of developing contacts between East and West—in order to establish a committee of experts on this issue.

    Pinay spoke first on this issue. He talked about cultural exchange and advocated developing trade relations between East and West. However, when he talked about the trade restrictions imposed by Western countries on the Soviet Union through the embargo on so-called strategic materials, he insisted that the scope of these restrictions was very narrow, so it was impossible to expect a large increase in trade by lifting them.

    Pinay advocated expanding Franco-Soviet cooperation and suggested establishing news centers in the capitals of both countries, declaring that he reserved the right to make more specific suggestions later.

    Macmillan then spoke, noting that the British government attached great importance to eliminating obstacles to free exchange between peoples and peaceful trade among nations. Macmillan said that progress had already been made in expanding British contacts with the Soviet Union, for example, in the increased number of mutual visits by delegations between the two countries. Macmillan said that when the meeting discussed the issue of contact in detail, the British delegation would make specific suggestions on the issue of cultural exchange.

    When talking about the development of trade, Macmillan, like Pinay, insisted that Western embargo restrictions did not play a major role in trade with the Soviet Union, and he blamed the Soviet Union for the failure of Anglo-Soviet trade relations to develop fully. Macmillan concluded by saying that the British delegation was prepared to study any suggestions that could develop world trade with a sympathetic attitude.

    Subsequently, Molotov spoke on the issue under discussion (see page 4). He submitted the Soviet delegation's proposals for developing contacts between East and West for consideration by the meeting.

    Then Dulles spoke. He said that the United States had hopes, but also caution, about taking measures to eliminate various obstacles in the way of free international exchange and the development of international trade. He believed that in an atmosphere of tension, it was impossible to achieve freedom of contact or normalization of trade all at once.

    Dulles divided the issue of contact into three parts: the free exchange of information and ideas; the free movement of people and freedom of travel; and the development of trade between East and West. In these areas, Dulles insisted that the Soviet Union was creating obstacles.

    When talking about the exchange of delegations between the United States and the Soviet Union, Dulles said that Americans would continue to take a favorable attitude toward such visits, as long as such visits were beneficial to both countries and reflected a genuine spirit of cooperation. When talking about expanding trade, Dulles agreed with Pinay and Macmillan on the view of restricting trade in so-called strategic materials.

    Pinay, on behalf of the French, British, and American delegations, submitted a memorandum including the suggestions of the three delegations on developing East-West contact. He pointed out that he believed that several points included in this document were close to the suggestions of the Soviet delegation.

    Dulles suggested that experts should consider the statements made by the ministers at the October 31st meeting and the suggestions they made.

    The ministers announced the names of the experts appointed by their governments.

    It was decided that the committee of experts should report their work to the ministers by November 10th, at which time the ministers would decide on the date to discuss the report at their meeting.

    Then, according to the agreement, the foreign ministers continued to discuss the first item on the agenda—European security and the German question.

    Molotov suggested inviting representatives of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to participate in the discussion of the German question. Molotov said that this should be done according to the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries. He pointed out that when two sovereign German states had already been formed on German territory, it was abnormal to pass decisions on the German question without the participation of their representatives.

    Molotov advocated that the four countries assist the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in approaching each other. He suggested that the meeting invite German Democratic Republic Premier Grotewohl and Federal Republic of Germany Federal Chancellor Adenauer to come to Geneva in person, or send their representatives to Geneva, to participate in the discussion of the German question.

    Dulles, Pinay, and Macmillan rejected the Soviet suggestion. They opposed inviting representatives of the German Democratic Republic. They said that, in their opinion, only representatives of the Federal Republic of Germany should be invited to participate.

    Molotov spoke, pointing out that the representatives of the three countries were obviously trying to prevent the German people from expressing their opinions at this meeting. He said that the Soviet Union advocated that representatives of the two Germanies participate in the meeting equally and opposed discrimination in this regard.

    He said that the fact that the meeting had not adopted a positive decision on the issue of inviting representatives from the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany could not but have a negative impact on the discussion of the German question. Undoubtedly, it would also be reasonably believed in Germany that the position taken by the representatives of the Western countries on this issue was not in line with the interests of the matter.

    Subsequently, Molotov made a speech on the issue of European security (see page 4). He submitted a draft European security treaty to the meeting.

    Macmillan said that the representatives of the three Western countries would study Molotov's speech and suggestions very carefully, and he was very interested in this speech and suggestions. Macmillan also said that he hoped to see the Soviet delegation's suggestions on the issue of restoring German unity.

    Dulles agreed with Macmillan's opinion.

    Molotov said that the Soviet delegation believed that at the next meeting the foreign ministers would be able to exchange views on the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation today, and then the Soviet delegation also intended to express its views on the German question.

    The meeting ended at this point. The next meeting was scheduled for November 2nd.

    四国外长会议讨论第一、三两项议程
    莫洛托夫提出欧洲安全条约草案
    并提出关于发展东西方之间接触的建议
    新华社一日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：法、英、苏、美四国外长十月三十一日举行第四次会议，由杜勒斯担任主席。
    根据上次会议的决定，这次会议一开始就讨论第三项议程——关于发展东西方之间的接触问题，以便成立关于这个问题的专家委员会。
    比内首先就这个问题发言。他谈到文化交流问题，并且主张发展东西方之间的贸易关系。但是他在谈到西方国家通过对苏联禁运所谓战略物资而实行的贸易限制时，他硬说采取这种限制的范围是十分狭窄的，所以不可能指望通过取消这种限制来大大增加贸易量。
    比内主张扩大法苏两国的合作，建议在两国首都建立新闻中心，他声明保留以后提出较为明确的建议的权利。
    麦克米伦接着发言，他指出，英国政府十分重视消除阻碍各国人民之间自由往来和和平贸易的障碍。麦克米伦说，在扩大英国同苏联的接触方面已经有了进展，例如在两国互相访问的代表团的数量增加了。麦克米伦说，当会议详细地讨论关于接触的问题时，英国代表团将就文化交流的问题提出具体的建议。
    麦克米伦在谈到发展贸易的时候，同比内一样，硬说西方的禁运限制在同苏联的贸易中并不起重大的作用，他并且把英苏贸易关系未能充分发展的责任推到苏联身上。麦克米伦最后说，英国代表团准备抱着同情的态度研究能够发展世界贸易的任何建议。
    随后，莫洛托夫就所讨论的问题发言（见第四版）。他把苏联代表团提出的关于发展东西方之间的接触的建议提交会议考虑。
    接着由杜勒斯发言。他说，美国对采取措施来消除在国际自由交往和发展国际贸易方面的种种障碍这个问题抱着希望，但是也很慎重。他认为，在紧张的气氛中，不可能一下子就达到交往的自由或贸易的正常化。
    杜勒斯把接触问题分成三部分：情报和思想的自由交流；人们的自由往来和旅行自由；发展东西方之间的贸易。杜勒斯在这些方面硬说苏联在制造着障碍。
    杜勒斯在谈到美苏两国交换代表团时，表示美国人将继续对这种访问采取赞同的态度，只要这种访问对两国都有利而且反映真诚的合作精神。杜勒斯在谈到扩大贸易问题时表示同意比内和麦克米伦对于限制所谓战略物资贸易的看法。
    比内代表法国、英国和美国代表团提出了包括三国代表团关于发展东西方接触的建议的备忘录。他指出，他认为这个文件中包括的若干点都和苏联代表团的建议接近。
    杜勒斯建议，专家们应当考虑部长们在十月三十一日的会议上的发言和他们所提出的建议。
    部长们宣布了他们的政府任命的专家们的姓名。
    经决定，专家委员会应于十一月十日以前向部长们报告他们的工作，而部长们那时将决定在他们的会议上讨论这个报告的日期。
    接着按照协议，外长们继续讨论第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题。
    莫洛托夫建议邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的代表参加对德国问题的讨论。莫洛托夫说，根据四国政府首脑的指示，应该这样做。他指出：当德国的领土上已经形成了两个有主权的德意志国家的时候，如果没有它们的代表参加就通过关于德国问题的决定，是不正常的。
    莫洛托夫主张四国协助德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近起来。他建议会议邀请德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥和德意志联邦共和国联邦总理阿登纳亲自前来，或者派遣他们的代表前来日内瓦，以便参加德国问题的讨论。
    杜勒斯、比内和麦克米伦拒绝苏联的建议。他们反对邀请德意志民主共和国的代表。他们说，在他们看来，只应邀请德意志联邦共和国的代表参加。
    莫洛托夫发言指出，三国代表显然是要阻止德国人民在这个会议上表达他们的意见。他说，苏联主张两个德国的代表平等地参加会议，反对在这一方面的歧视。
    他说，会议就邀请德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国代表的问题没有采取积极的决定这一事实，不能不对德国问题的讨论产生消极的影响。无疑，在德国也将合理地认为西方国家代表在这一问题上所采取的立场是不符合事情的利益的。
    随后莫洛托夫作了关于欧洲安全问题的发言（见第四版）。他向会议提出了欧洲安全条约草案。
    麦克米伦说道，西方三国代表将极其仔细地研究莫洛托夫的发言和建议，他对这一发言和建议很感兴趣。麦克米伦还说，他希望看到苏联代表团关于恢复德国统一问题的建议。
    杜勒斯赞成麦克米伦的意见。
    莫洛托夫说道，苏联代表团认为，在下次会议上外长们将可以就苏联代表团今天提出的建议交换意见，然后苏联代表团也打算就德国问题表示意见。
    会议至此结束。下次会议定在十一月二日举行。
