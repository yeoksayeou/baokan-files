Some time ago, when the weather turned cold, people were unable to find woolen sweaters of suitable colors and sizes in the various branches of the Beijing Department Store.

However, in October, the Beijing Knitwear Factory was on the verge of being forced to shut down due to the stockpile of more than 10,000 dozens of various woolen sweaters and pants, and consequent financial difficulties.

Why did this strange phenomenon occur? In the third quarter of this year, the knitwear factory, acting on the suggestion of the Municipal Department Store, changed the wooden boxes originally used for packing woolen sweaters to cardboard boxes, reducing the cost of each box by 2.4 yuan. The knitwear factory wanted to count this money as their own production improvement, but the Municipal Department Store disagreed, arguing that since cardboard boxes were used, they should not pay the price of wooden boxes. There was also another matter: the woolen sweaters produced by the knitwear factory had their sizes shortened according to new specifications in six varieties, and one more piece could be produced for every two and a half dozens. The handling of this money was also a matter of endless dispute between the two parties. In a word, they argued for several months over this small amount of money and were unwilling to sign a contract.

The fourth quarter arrived, and both sides believed the time was ripe. The Municipal Department Store thought: If I don't purchase your goods, you will have a stockpile of funds and production will be difficult, and in the end, you will have to compromise. The knitwear factory thought that the problem would be easily solved when it was time to sell. The more tense the market, the fiercer they argued, until October 17, when the Beijing First Bureau of Industry and the First Bureau of Commerce intervened and resolved the issue: the money saved from simplifying the packaging would be split 50-50; the money saved from changing the specifications of the woolen sweaters would result in the knitwear factory lowering the ex-factory price, and the Municipal Department Store lowering the selling price.

After the problem was solved, both sides were still full of complaints. The person in charge of the knitwear factory said, "This is our production improvement, why should it be shared with the Municipal Department Store?" The person in charge of the wholesale station of the Municipal Department Store said, "We are paying for wooden boxes, but they are giving us cardboard boxes. They are calling this increased production and conservation. Is there such a thing in the world?" May I ask these departmentalists, why don't you think about the needs of the masses at all? Do you have to wait until the factory closes down and the store closes down before you think about the overall interests?

    本位主义的毒害
    前些时候，天气冷了，人们却无法在北京市百货公司各门市部里挑到合适的颜色和号码的绒衣。
    但是，北京市针织厂十月份却因为积压各种绒衣绒裤一万多打，资金困难，几乎被迫停工。
    这种奇怪的现象为什么会发生？今年第三季度，针织厂接受了市百货公司的建议，把原来装绒衣的木箱改成纸箱了，每个箱子的成本降低了二元四角。针织厂要把这笔钱算在自己改进生产的账上，市百货公司不同意，认为既然用的是纸箱子，就不能按木箱子收钱。还有一件事：针织厂生产的绒衣有六种按着新的规格改短了尺寸，每生产两打半就可多出一件，这笔钱的处理，双方也争个不休。一句话，就是为了这点钱，争执了好几个月，都不愿意签订合同。
    第四季度来了，双方都认为时机已到。市百货公司认为：我不进货，你就得积压资金，生产就会困难，最后不能不让步；针织厂认为，到你脱售的时候，问题就容易解决了。市场越紧张，他们越吵得凶，直到十月十七日北京市第一工业局和第一商业局进行调处，问题才获得解决：简化包装省下来的钱各得百分之五十；改变绒衣规格省下的钱，针织厂降低出厂价格，市百货公司降低价格出售。
    问题解决以后，双方仍然牢骚满腹。针织厂的负责人说：“这是我们的生产改进，为什么要分给市百货公司？”市百货公司批发站的负责人说：“拿我们木箱子的钱，给的却是纸箱子，他们倒叫增产节约，天底下哪有这样的道理呢？”请问这些本位主义者，你们为什么一点也不为群众的需要着想，难道要等到工厂倒闭，商店关门的时候，你们才会想到整体利益吗？
