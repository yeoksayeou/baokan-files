Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, November 14th. The first exploration well drilled by Xinjiang Petroleum Company in the Karamay Oilfield was completed on October 30th. Now, crude oil is continuously gushing straight up from the bottom of the well, and oil workers are conducting oil tests on the wellhead.

Based on the oil production of this exploration well and the seismic and electrical survey data this year, geologists believe that the Karamay Oilfield is a promising oilfield. Its oil layers are shallow, and development requires less investment than the oilfields currently being prepared for or already under exploitation. At present, Xinjiang Petroleum Company is actively building roads to this oilfield and constructing housing, preparing to continue drilling two more exploration wells. After drilling another batch of exploration wells next year, the reserves of this oilfield can be basically determined.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, November 14th. The first low-temperature carbonization furnace for artificial petroleum, which Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 began restoring in April this year, has been completed and was ignited and dried on the 5th. Trial production is expected at the end of the month.

This low-temperature carbonization furnace suffered severe damage during the Japanese imperialist surrender and the Kuomintang rule. After this restoration and formal commissioning, its efficiency will be 50% higher than its original peak efficiency. The main function of this low-temperature carbonization furnace is to produce tar from coal using low-temperature carbonization. This tar can be made into gasoline, kerosene, or diesel through hydrogenation or distillation. It is estimated that more than ten tons of tar can be extracted from every hundred tons of coal, and the entire production process only takes about twenty hours. The byproduct, semi-coke, is another raw material for the synthetic oil industry.

While restoring the first low-temperature carbonization furnace, Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5 has already started the restoration of another low-temperature carbonization furnace. Next year, the factory will also construct new low-temperature carbonization furnaces.

### 新疆石油公司黑油山油田第一口探井出油　东北石油五厂第一部低温干馏炉点火烘炉

　　新疆石油公司黑油山油田第一口探井出油
　　东北石油五厂第一部低温干馏炉点火烘炉
    新华社乌鲁木齐十四日电　新疆石油公司在黑油山油田钻凿的第一口探井，已经在十月三十日钻凿完成。现在，地下原油已经不断地从井底直喷上来，采油工人正在井上试油。
    根据这口探井出油情况和今年地震、电测的资料，地质人员认为黑油山油田是一个有希望的油田。它的油层较浅，开采起来比目前准备开采的和已经开采的油田投资都少。目前，新疆石油公司正积极修建通往这个油田的公路，同时在建筑施工房舍，准备继续开钻两口探井。等到明年再钻凿一批探井后，这个油田的储量就可以基本上探清。
    新华社沈阳十四日电　东北石油五厂今年四月动工恢复的第一部人造石油低温干馏炉已经完工，并且在五日点火烘炉，预计月底可以试生产。
    这部低温干馏炉在日本帝国主义投降和国民党统治时期曾遭受严重的破坏。这次恢复完成并且正式投入生产以后，它的效率将比原来的最高效率还要提高百分之五十。这部低温干馏炉的主要作用是把煤用低温干馏的方法生产出焦油。这些焦油经过加氢或蒸馏的方法，就可以制成汽油、煤油或柴油。据估计，每一百吨煤可以提炼出十吨以上的焦油，全部生产过程只需要二十个小时左右。副产品半焦还是人造油工业的另一种原料。
    东北石油五厂在恢复第一部低温干馏炉的同时，已经着手进行另一部低温干馏炉的恢复工作。明年，这个工厂还要建设新的低温干馏炉。
