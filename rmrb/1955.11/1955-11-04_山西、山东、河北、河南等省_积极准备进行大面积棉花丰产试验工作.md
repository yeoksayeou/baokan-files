Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Gansu, Shaanxi and other major cotton-producing provinces are actively preparing for large-scale cotton high-yield trials based on the suggestions of Soviet expert Professor Titov. Shanxi and Shandong provinces plan to conduct large-scale high-yield trials on 700,000 mu of cotton fields in 4,200 agricultural production cooperatives, requiring an average yield of about 200 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of 40 to 60 jin compared with this year's output. Shandong Province also requires state-owned farms throughout the province and the cotton fields of 300 key agricultural production cooperatives to produce 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, of which the cotton fields of 15 key state-owned farms will produce 360 jin per mu. In order to implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, Qiliying Township, Xinxiang County, Henan Province, examined the shortcomings of past cotton planting work and plans that the township's 13,000 mu of cotton will produce an average of 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, an increase of more than 36 percent compared with this year. In order to ensure the realization of this large-scale high-yield plan, all regions have focused on studying and carrying out technical measures and preparing production materials such as close planting, winter plowing, fertilization, seed selection, and pest control. Shanxi Province plans to train 300,000 peasant technicians this winter and next spring, and Shandong Province will print and distribute 300,000 technical manuals. Other cotton-producing provinces are also actively carrying out this work.
    In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture has also determined that the Anyang Cotton Farm in Henan, the Shanghai Farm in Jiangsu, the Linqing Cotton Farm in Shandong, and the Yuncheng in Shanxi, the Shijiazhuang in Hebei, and the Jinghui three experimental stations in Shaanxi as key points for large-scale cotton high-yield trials in 1956. It is planned to conduct high-yield trials on more than 22,800 mu of cotton fields, including more than 1,600 mu of Soviet fine "108F" cotton. It is planned to plant about 6,000 cotton plants per mu, with an estimated output of 400 to 600 jin of seed cotton. At present, in addition to making preparations for technology and production materials, these farms and stations have also invited a group of technicians from the Xinjiang Agricultural Production and Construction Corps to specifically help them learn from Xinjiang's high-yield experience.
    Recently, Professor Titov, a Soviet expert from the Xinjiang August 1st Agricultural College, visited cotton producing areas in Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces and found that these areas have great potential for cotton production. Due to the old cotton varieties used in these areas, poor autumn plowing for moisture conservation, late sowing, sparse cotton plants, and too early pruning, cotton production has been greatly affected. Therefore, Professor Titov suggested that all regions should plan to introduce Soviet fine cotton varieties and use Soviet advanced experience to conduct high-yield trials. Therefore, the Ministry of Agriculture has decided to introduce 22 kinds of Soviet fine cotton seeds in 1956 for trials in agricultural science research institutes and experimental stations in various regions.

    山西、山东、河北、河南等省
    积极准备进行大面积棉花丰产试验工作
    山西、山东、河北、河南、甘肃、陕西等主要产棉的省份，根据苏联专家提托夫教授的建议，积极准备进行大面积棉花丰产试验工作。山西、山东两省计划在四千二百个农业生产合作社七十万亩棉田进行大面积丰产试验，要求每亩平均产籽棉二百斤左右，比今年产量增加四十至六十斤。山东省还要求全省国营农场和三百个重点农业生产合作社的棉田每亩产三百斤籽棉，其中十五个重点国营农场的棉田每亩产三百六十斤。河南省新乡县七里营乡为了贯彻执行苏联专家的建议，检查了过去植棉工作的缺点，计划全乡一万三千亩棉花，平均每亩产籽棉三百斤，比今年增百分之三十六以上。为了保证实现这个大面积丰产计划，各地都着重研究和进行了密植、冬耕、施肥、选种、治虫等技术措施和生产资料准备工作。山西省计划在今冬明春训练三十万农民技术手，山东省印发三十万册技术手册。其他各产棉省目前也正在积极进行这个工作。
    另外农业部还确定在河南安阳棉场、江苏上海农场、山东临清棉场和山西运城、河北石家庄、陕西泾惠三个试验站作为一九五六年进行大面积棉花丰产试验重点，计划进行丰产试验的棉田有二万二千八百多亩，其中引种苏联优良“一○八夫”棉一千六百多亩。计划每亩植棉六千株左右，计产籽棉四百至六百斤。目前，这些场、站除了作好技术和生产资料的准备外，还邀请新疆农业生产建设部队派遣一批技术人员来具体帮助他们学习新疆丰产经验。
    最近新疆八一农学院苏联专家提托夫教授分别到河南、河北、江苏等省棉产区考察后，发现这些地区的棉田潜力很大，由于这些地区采用的棉花品种很老，秋耕保墒不好，播种期迟，棉株稀，整枝太早等原因使棉花的产量受到很大影响。所以提托夫教授建议各地有计划的引进苏联优良棉花品种和运用苏联先进经验进行丰产试验。因此，农业部决定一九五六年引进苏联优良棉种二十二种，在各地农业科学研究所和试验站进行试验。
