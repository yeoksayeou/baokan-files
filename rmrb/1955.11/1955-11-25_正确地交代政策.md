　　Correctly Explain the Policies
　　After Yangpan Township in Minhou County, Fujian Province, set up the "cooperative framework," they explained the cooperative's specific policies to the members and estimated the potential income each household could receive from labor, land, and other aspects. This allowed members to understand the benefits of joining the cooperative and the possible problems they might encounter. After these estimations, out of the 141 households who signed up, a dozen or so households with a lack of labor or a larger amount of land realized their income might temporarily decrease. These households fully considered various situations and re-evaluated their attitude towards joining the cooperative. Among them, fourteen households who already had production difficulties felt that although joining the cooperative might temporarily reduce their income, not joining would create even greater difficulties, so they decided to stay in the cooperative. Another five households were concerned that their income after joining the cooperative might not immediately catch up with what they earned outside of it, so they preferred to withdraw temporarily and rejoin next year.
　　The experience of this township proves that this approach can enable farmers joining the cooperative to fully understand the policies, dispel various doubts, ensure truly voluntary participation, and avoid "wavering" after encountering difficulties. However, some local workers, not understanding this principle and merely aiming for a more in-depth explanation of the policies, deliberately exaggerated the difficulties after joining the cooperative when explaining it to the members. This is, of course, utterly absurd.

　　正确地交代政策
    福建省闽侯县洋泮乡把“社架子”搭起以后，向社员说明了合作社各种具体政策，估算了各户从劳力、土地等方面可能得到的收入，让社员了解入社的好处和可能发生的问题。经过估算，报名入社的一百四十一户中，有十几户缺乏劳力或土地较多的户，收入可能暂时要少一些。这些户充分考虑了各种情况，重新确定了自己是否入社的态度。他们中间有十四户，原来生产就有困难，他们觉得入了社虽然可能暂时减少一些收入，但是不入社困难更大，决心留在社里。另有五户怕入社后的收入一时赶不上自己留在社外的收入多，愿意暂时退出到明年再入。
    这个乡的经验证明，这样作可以使入社农民全面了解政策，解除各种疑虑，作到入社真正自愿，免得入社后遇到困难，又“二心不定”。但是，有个别地方的工作人员，不了解这个道理只是为了更深入地交代政策，在向社员讲解的时候，故意夸大入社后的困难，这当然是十分荒谬的。
