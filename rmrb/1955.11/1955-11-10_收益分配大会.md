    Income Distribution Meeting
    This year, the four agricultural cooperatives in Xinnong Village, Zhangtaizi District, Liaoyang County, Liaoning Province, have all increased production, with yields about 20 percent higher than those of farmers outside the cooperatives in the village. At this time, the members are most concerned about the issue of income distribution. Some worry about receiving too little, not enough to eat; others worry that the distribution will not be fair, and they will suffer losses.
    The Xinnong Village Branch of the Chinese Communist Party led the four cooperatives to hold income distribution meetings separately, and invited more than 200 farmer households outside the cooperatives to participate. At the meetings, each cooperative summarized its production achievements over the past year, reported on the distribution principles, and the actual income of each member household. This not only compared the production of the cooperatives with that of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, but also compared the income of members with more land and less labor, and those with more labor and less land, with their income before joining the cooperatives. As a result of this distribution, ninety-four member households were all very happy, as their incomes had all increased compared to before joining the cooperatives.
    This kind of income distribution meeting educated the members. They personally reviewed the income and expenditure of the entire cooperative, and truly understood the principles of fair and reasonable distribution. It also educated the farmers outside the cooperatives, who from then on specifically recognized the superiority of the cooperatives. More than one hundred farmers have already signed up to join the cooperatives.

    收益分配大会
    辽宁省辽阳县张台子区新农村四个农业合作社今年都增产了，产量高于本村社外农民百分之二十左右。这时社员们最关心的是收益分配问题。有的怕分得少，不够吃；有的怕分的不公平，吃了亏。
    中共新农村支部领导四个社分别召开收益分配大会，并邀请全村二百多户社外农民参加。各社在会上总结一年来的生产成绩，报告分配原则和每户社员的实际收入。这不但把合作社的生产同互助组、单干农民的生产作了对比，而且把土地多劳力少、劳力多土地少的社员的收入情况同入社前作了比较。这样分配的结果，九十四户社员皆大欢喜，他们的收入都比入社以前增加了。
    这种收益分配大会使社员受到教育，他们亲自审查了全社的收支情况，真正认识了公平合理的分配原则。也使社外农民受到教育，他们从此具体地认识了合作社的优越性，有一百多户农民已报名要求入社。
