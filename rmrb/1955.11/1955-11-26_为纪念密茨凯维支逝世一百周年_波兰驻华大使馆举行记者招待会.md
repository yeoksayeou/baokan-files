Xinhua News Agency, November 25th: To commemorate the centenary of the death of the great Polish poet and political activist Adam Mickiewicz on November 26th, the Polish Embassy in China's Chargé d'affaires ad interim, Majman, held a press conference in Beijing on the 25th to introduce Mickiewicz's life and works.

At the meeting, Majman said: "This year, not only the Polish people, but also progressive people all over the world are commemorating Mickiewicz. He is great because his works belong to the most outstanding literary treasures of Poland and the world. Through his writings, he beautified Polish culture and also beautified world literature."

Next, Majman gave a detailed introduction to Mickiewicz's life and works. He said: "Mickiewicz embodied the great national traditions of revolution, patriotism, and humanism in his life and creation."

Majman said that as the author of the poetic drama "Forefathers' Eve," Mickiewicz joined the ranks of the greatest writers in mankind who dedicated their genius to the struggle for the happiness of all nations tormented by slavery and exploitation. Today, all of our people commemorate him not only as the creator of the greatest masterpieces of Polish poetry, but also as the standard-bearer of the ideological struggle for his motherland's liberation from political enslavement and the ideological standard-bearer of the struggle for the rights of the oppressed Polish people.

Chi Zhike, a Polish language expert from Peking University, then answered questions from reporters about Mickiewicz's life and deeds.

As early as 1907, Mickiewicz was introduced to China by Mr. Lu Xun. Among the works of this Polish writer published in Chinese in China are "Pan Tadeusz" and a selected collection of poems.

Mickiewicz is one of the four world cultural figures who were commemorated at a conference held in Beijing this May.

　　为纪念密茨凯维支逝世一百周年
　　波兰驻华大使馆举行记者招待会
    新华社二十五日讯　十一月二十六日是波兰伟大诗人和政治活动家密茨凯维支逝世一百周年纪念，波兰驻华大使馆临时代办马伊曼二十五日在北京举行了记者招待会，介绍密茨凯维支的生平和著作。
    马伊曼在会上说：“今年，不仅波兰人民，而且全世界进步人类都在纪念密茨凯维支。他之所以伟大是由于他的作品是属于波兰和全世界最优秀的文学宝库的。通过他的著作，他美化了波兰文化，也美化了世界文学。”
    接着，马伊曼详尽地介绍了密茨凯维支的生平事迹和他的作品。他说：“密茨凯维支在自己的生活和创作中体现了革命性、爱国主义和人道主义的伟大民族传统。”
    马伊曼说，作为“先人祭”这一诗剧的作者，密茨凯维支加入了把自己的天才献给为争取所有被奴役和剥削所折磨的各民族的幸福而斗争的人类最伟大作家的行列。今天我们全体人民不仅把他作为波兰诗歌最伟大的杰作的创造者来纪念他，而且也把他作为争取自己祖国摆脱政治奴役的解放斗争思想的旗手和为被压迫的波兰人民争取权利的斗争的思想旗手来纪念他。
    北京大学波兰文专家契日克接着回答了记者们提出来的有关密茨凯维支的生平和事迹的问题。
    密茨凯维支远在一九○七年就由鲁迅先生介绍到中国来。在中国用中文出版的这位波兰人的著作中有“塔杜施先生”和一本诗选。
    密茨凯维支是北京今年五月曾经举行大会纪念的四位世界文化名人之一。
