　　We are Already Doing the Work of 1956
　　Completing Production Tasks Ahead of Schedule Even with Old Machines
To the Editor:
    I am a lathe operator in the wheel workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory. On August 10th of this year, I already completed my production task for the entire year and started doing the work of 1956. By the beginning of November, I had done the equivalent of five months' worth of this year's production tasks.
    I am able to complete the tasks assigned by the state ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota because of the Party's education. The lathe I use is very old. In the past, working with it was like a slow ox pulling a broken cart. It took three hours to turn a locomotive axle once. At that time, I felt that there was no way to improve efficiency because the machine was old, so I didn't pay attention to learning advanced experience and improving operating techniques. In the third and fourth quarters of last year, our production tasks continued to increase, but I often failed to complete the daily plan, even affecting the locomotive's failure to leave the factory according to plan. What to do? I worked overtime to catch up with the task, but I was so tired every day that my back ached and my legs hurt, and I still couldn't complete the plan.
    Later, the leaders of the Party and the trade union repeatedly educated me, which made me break the wrong idea that "production plans cannot be completed without replacing the old machine with a new machine." Therefore, I formulated a plan to promote the Soviet Kolesov tool method and determined to try this advanced operating technology. Considering that deep cuts and increased feed speeds would cause the top of the product to heat up and easily cause accidents, I installed an automatic oiler on the lathe to keep the oil flowing onto the top. On the first day I started trying high-speed cutting, I increased the number of revolutions of the lathe from more than 20 revolutions per minute in the past to 200 revolutions, which increased work efficiency by more than three times. From then on, my lathe was no longer a slow ox pulling a broken cart! From September to the end of last year, in four months, I completed seven months of work.
    I am not satisfied with such achievements. I continued to study the advanced experience of high-speed cutting and adopted the method of installing a chip breaker on the tool bar to prevent the long curled chips from damaging the cutting edge. With the support of the leadership and the help of the workers, this experiment was successful, which not only further improved work efficiency but also extended the service life of the tool. Then, I learned the advanced operating method of Zhuang Minggeng, an advanced lathe operator from Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, and prepared materials, drawings, tools, etc. before starting work, and implemented phased operations to save unnecessary auxiliary time. In this way, I overfulfilled the production plan every month this year, and completed two months of work in June alone. I and other worker comrades took the initiative to request to increase the quota, but still overfulfilled the plan, and the product quality was very good, and there were no defective products.
    I will work harder to contribute more to the completion of the country's first five-year plan.

　　Saving Auxiliary Time in Production
To the Editor:
    At the end of October, I had already completed the work volume for the whole year ahead of schedule and started doing the work of 1956!
    I am a mechanic of a thread rolling machine. This thread rolling machine is manufactured in Democratic Germany, and it can produce thousands of various screws needed for repairing automobiles every day. The Five-Year Plan requires each of us workers to work harder and do our work well. I often think about my beloved thread rolling machine, how can we produce more screws for the country?
    Finally, I figured out a truth: using a thread rolling machine to produce screws is just one action by pressing the electric gate; however, the time spent on auxiliary processes such as taking the work-piece, placing the work-piece, and aligning the tool is even longer than the time the machine works. This means that the production volume can be greatly increased if the auxiliary production time can be shortened as much as possible.
    Therefore, I tried hard to find ways to save auxiliary time in production. I rationally changed the direction of placing the work-piece and shortened the time for aligning the tool. According to the characteristics of thread rolling machine production, I reduced the number of work-piece measurements. Every time I changed the work-piece, I made the first piece (the first sample) accurately, and then measured a few more work-pieces, so that each subsequent work-piece did not need to be measured; this can ensure the quality of the product. For example, in October, the defective rate in my production was more than 70% lower than the quota. I used to wipe the tool with dry cotton thread, but later I switched to wiping the tool with oil-soaked cotton thread, which made it faster to change the tool and also saved cotton thread.... The time saved by seconds or even half-seconds, when put together, ensures that I can complete the annual plan two months ahead of schedule.
    I cannot be satisfied with the above achievements. I thought that if some auxiliary production processes could be automated, more time could be saved. I started thinking about this in September. With the support of the leadership and the help of comrades, I used waste materials to trial-produce an automatic material return tool. After testing in October, this creation has achieved initial success; it is now being improved.
    Of course, my work still has shortcomings, and I haven't done enough to help other comrades. For example, a comrade who works with me in shifts on the same machine cannot achieve the quota. I am a member of the Communist Youth League and have a responsibility to help him. Recently, the leaders have decided to have me introduce experience in the group to help other comrades improve their operating skills. I will definitely do my best to do this work well, and I will also humbly learn from the experience of other comrades so that we can jointly make greater achievements in production!

　　我们已经在做一九五六年的工作
　　用旧机器也能提前完成生产任务编辑同志：
    我是长辛店机车车辆修理工厂车轮车间的一名车工。今年八月十日，我就已经完成了全年的生产任务，开始做一九五六年的工作。到十一月初，我又做了等于今年五个月的生产任务的工作。
    我能够提前和超额完成国家交给的任务，是党对我教育的结果。我使用的旋床很旧，过去工作起来像老牛破车似的，一根机车轮轴旋一遍刀需要三个小时。那时候，我觉得机器破旧没有办法提高效率，因此就不注意学习先进经验，改进操作技术。去年第三、四季度，我们的生产任务不断地增加，但是我经常完不成日计划，甚至影响到机车不能按计划出厂。怎么办呢？我就加班加点赶任务，但是每天累得腰酸腿痛仍然完不成计划。
    后来，党和工会的领导人员再三向我进行教育，使我打破了“不换新机器就不能完成生产计划”的错误看法。于是，我就拟定了推行苏联科列索夫车刀法的计划，决心试用这种先进的操作技术。我考虑到吃深刀和加大走刀速度以后，会使得产品顶尖部分发热，容易发生事故，于是就在车床上安装了一个自动给油器，使油源源不断地浇在顶尖上。在我开始试用高速切削法的第一天，就把车床的旋转次数从过去每分钟二十多转提高到二百转，使工作效率提高了三倍多。从此，我这台车床再也不是老牛破车了！去年九月到年底四个月中，我完成了七个月的工作量。
    我并不满足于这样的成绩。我继续研究高速切削的先进经验，采取在刀杆上安装断屑器的办法，防止卷屑过长损坏刀刃。在领导的支持和工人们的帮助下，这一项试验成功了，不但进一步提高了工作效率，而且延长了刀的使用期限。接着，我又学习了戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂先进车工庄铭耕的先进操作法，在开工前做好材料、图纸、工具等准备工作，并且实行分段作业节省不必要的辅助时间。这样，今年每个月我都超额完成了生产计划，六月份一个月就完成了两个月的工作量。我和其他工人同志们主动要求提高定额，但是仍然超额完成计划，而且产品质量很好，没有出过一件废品。
    我还要加倍努力，争取为完成国家第一个五年计划贡献更大的力量。

　　节约生产中的辅助时间编辑同志：
    十月底，我已经提前完成了今年全年的工作量，开始做一九五六年的工作！
    我是一个滚扣机的机工。这台滚扣机是民主德国制造的，它一天可以生产好几千个修配汽车所需要的各种螺丝。五年计划要求我们每一个工人加倍努力地做好工作，我经常对着我那台心爱的滚扣机想，咱们怎样才能再为国家生产更多的螺丝呢？
    终于，我捉摸出了一个道理：用滚扣机生产螺丝，只要按一下电闸就是一个活；但是，拿活、放活和对刀等辅助过程所用的时间却比机器干活的时间还长。这就是说，必须尽量缩短生产辅助时间，生产量才可以大大提高。
    因此，我在生产中就努力想办法节约辅助时间。我合理地改变了放活的方向，缩短了对刀的时间。根据滚扣机生产的特点，我减少了量活的次数，在每次换活的时候先把首件（第一件样子）做精确，接着再量几个活，以后的活就不必每个都量了；这样做是可以保证产品质量的，像十月份我生产中的废品率就比定额降低了百分之七十以上。我过去用干棉丝擦刀，后来改用沾油的棉丝擦刀，换刀就快了，还节省了棉丝……。这样节约的一秒钟甚至半秒钟的时间，集中起来就保证我能够提前两个月完成全年计划。
    我不能满足于以上的成绩。我想到，如果把某些辅助的生产过程自动化，就可以节省更多的时间。九月份开始我就捉摸这件事。在领导的支持下和同志们的帮助下，我利用废料试制了一个自动退料工具。十月份经过试验，这个创造已经得到了初步的成功；现在正在改进中。
    当然，我的工作还是有缺点的，对其他同志的帮助就做得还不够。像同我一台机床倒班干活的一个同志，生产还不能达到定额。我是一个青年团员，有责任帮助他。最近领导同志已经决定要我在小组里介绍经验，帮助其他同志提高操作技术。我一定尽力把这件工作做好，而且也要虚心地学习其他同志的经验，以便共同在生产中做出更大的成绩！　　　　　　第一机械工业部第一汽车附件厂工人　宗光瑞
