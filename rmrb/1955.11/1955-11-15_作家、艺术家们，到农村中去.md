　　Writers and Artists, Go to the Countryside

　　The upsurge of socialist reform in our country's rural areas has arrived. This is an earth-shattering historical event. Needless to say, it attracts our writers and artists, who possess a keen sense of the times, like a magnet.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China are the signal and pointer for this socialist movement, and for writers and artists, it is also a great encouraging force. From this, writers, artists, and the people of the whole country have received infinite inspiration. Precisely because of this, some writers and artists who are willing to strive to portray the rural life of our country but are not currently in the countryside, after studying these documents, quickly went to the countryside, and some writers and artists are also about to go down, determined to personally observe, experience, and creatively express this great historical revolutionary change.

　　This is undoubtedly correct and welcome. The large-scale socialist revolutionary movement of 500 million peasants, the historically significant and profound transformation of the material and spiritual lives of 500 million peasants in this great movement, should never leave a blank space in literature and art. The current basic task of our country's people's literature and art is to express the people's enthusiastic and colorful struggle for socialism, and to create authentic characters with the spiritual outlook of advanced laborers. And in order to express and create anything, one must first be familiar with that thing, which has long been a recognized common sense.

　　It should be pointed out that some works reflecting agricultural cooperation have already been produced in the past two years, among which, although there are many monotonous, formulaic, and conceptual things, there have also been some excellent harvests welcomed by the masses. However, both in terms of quantity and quality, the existing achievements are still not satisfactory, not to mention that the current development of the movement has long exceeded the level reflected in the existing works. While closely watching the development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the broad masses of people are eagerly looking forward to obtaining the latest reflection of rural life from literary and artistic works, and to obtaining more magical and inspiring expressions than the existing works. Writers and artists have no reason not to work hard to satisfy this ardent wish of the people. Of course, we do not regard agricultural cooperation and the revolutionary changes of the peasants as the only themes in current literature and art; and in order to comprehensively express rural life and profoundly portray the image of peasants, we must not limit ourselves to one time, one place, one issue, or one perspective. However, one cannot imagine that a writer or artist who intends to portray our times on a broad canvas can lack the necessary observation and understanding of the current "hot" rural areas. Even writers and artists who do not intend to focus on depicting rural life, it is entirely necessary to spend some time getting to know the dynamics of the peasants, who account for six-fifths of our country's population, in the current events. We hope that more writers and artists will take advantage of the high tide of the movement to go to the countryside, to increase their talents, temper their thoughts, and obtain creative inspiration. Some writers and artists are engaged in other occupations or other work that cannot be separated from for a long time, and the leading aspects of the units where they are located should also make some special arrangements to free up some time for them to go down, even if the time is shorter. Writers and artists, go deep into the fiery struggle, go deep into the countryside which is in the high tide of social reform, and strive to enrich our country's literary and artistic creation with multi-faceted and profound observations and vivid and splendid expressions!

　　作家、艺术家们，到农村中去
    我国农村中的社会主义改革的高潮已经到来了。这是一个惊天动地的历史事件。不用说，它像磁石般地吸引着我们具有敏锐的时代感的作家和艺术家。
    毛泽东同志的“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”，是这一社会主义运动的信号和指针，对于作家、艺术家说来，也是一个伟大的鼓舞的力量。从这里，作家、艺术家和全国人民一样，得到了无穷的启示。正因为这样，有一些愿意努力表现我国农村生活而现在不在农村的作家、艺术家，在学习了这些文件之后，很快就到农村去了，还有一些作家、艺术家也将要下去，他们立志要去亲自观察、体验并且创造性地表现这一伟大的历史性的革命变化。
    这无疑是正确的，值得欢迎的。五亿农民的大规模的社会主义的革命运动，五亿农民的物质生活和精神生活在这个伟大运动中的有历史意义的深刻转变，在文学艺术中决不应该留下空白。我国人民文学艺术目前的基本任务，正是表现人民群众为社会主义而进行的热烈的多采的斗争，创造具有先进的劳动者的精神面貌的真实人物。而为了表现和创造无论什么事物，就得首先熟悉这个事物，这早已是公认的常识了。
    应该指出：反映农业合作化的作品在过去两年内已经产生了一些，其中虽然有不少是单调的公式化概念化的东西，但是也出现了一些优秀的、得到群众欢迎的收获。但是无论从数量和质量来说，已有的成绩都还是不能令人满足的，更不必说目前运动的发展早已超出了已有的作品所反映的水平。广大人民在密切地注视着农业合作化运动的发展的同时，迫切地盼望从文学艺术作品中得到农村生活的最新的反映，得到比已有的作品更有魔力、更能够激动人心的表现。作家、艺术家没有理由不努力去满足人民这个殷切的愿望。自然，我们并不把农业合作化和农民的革命变化，看做是当前文学艺术中的唯一主题；而要全面地表现农村生活，深刻地刻划农民形象，更不能以一时一地一个问题一个角度为限。但是，总不能设想，一个打算要在广阔的画面上表现我们的时代的作家、艺术家，对于当前的“热火朝天”的农村可以缺少必要的观察和理解。甚至不打算着重描写农村生活的作家、艺术家，用一定的时间来认识一下占我国人口六分之五的农民在当前事变中的动态，也是完全必要的。我们希望有更多的作家、艺术家，趁着运动的高潮，到农村中去，到那里去增长才干，锻炼思想，取得创作的灵感。有一部分作家、艺术家，担任着其他的不能长期脱离的职业或其他的工作，他们所在的单位的领导方面，也应该做一些特殊的安排，让他们腾出些时间下去，那怕时间短些也好。作家、艺术家们，深入到火热的斗争中去，深入到处在社会改革的高潮中的农村去，努力用多方面的精深的观察和有血有肉的灿烂的表现，来丰富我国的文学艺术创作！
