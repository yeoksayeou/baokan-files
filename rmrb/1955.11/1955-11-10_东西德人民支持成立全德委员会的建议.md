Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 9th. According to the German News Agency: Representatives of people from all walks of life and social figures in East and West Germany have expressed their support for the proposal in the statement by the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the establishment of an All-German Committee.

    Representatives from the Karl Marx Stadt district, representing two million voters, sent the recent statement by the government of the German Democratic Republic to the members of the North Rhine-Westphalia state parliament in West Germany, requesting them to discuss the proposal to establish an All-German Committee with their voters, and also suggesting the mutual dispatch of delegations.

    Some municipal leaders from the German Democratic Republic and West Germany, as well as representatives from West German immigrant organizations, in a joint letter, requested that the foreign ministers of the four powers listen to the opinions of representatives from both Germanys on issues that are closely related to the German people. The letter expressed its belief that the proposal by the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the establishment of an All-German Committee is a useful basis for holding negotiations between the two Germanys.

    The presidium of a pan-German group composed of representatives from East and West German townships—the German Conference—in a telegram to the foreign ministers of the four powers, expressed the hope that they would reach an agreement on the issue of establishing a European security system, so that both Germanys could participate. At the same time, it stated that in order to reunify peacefully, the Germans themselves must reach an understanding. To achieve this goal, the proposed All-German Committee is an appropriate format.

    Professor Fassbinder of Bonn, speaking at a conference held by West German non-violent activists on the 6th, also welcomed the proposal to organize an All-German Committee.

    东西德人民支持成立全德委员会的建议
    新华社柏林九日电　据德意志通讯社讯：东西德各阶层人民的代表和社会人士纷纷表示支持德意志民主共和国政府声明中关于成立全德委员会的建议。
    卡尔·马克思斯塔特专区的代表们代表两百万选民把德意志民主共和国政府最近的声明送给西德北莱因—威斯特伐利亚州议会的议员，要求他们同他们的选民讨论成立全德委员会的建议，同时，建议互派代表团。
    德意志民主共和国和西德的一些市政领袖以及西德移民组织的代表在一封联名信中要求四国外交部长在和德国人民有切身关系的问题上听取两个德国的代表的意见。这封信表示相信，德意志民主共和国政府关于成立全德委员会的建议是在两个德国之间举行谈判的有用的基础。
    由东西德乡镇代表组成的一个全德性的团体——德意志会议的主席团在打给四国外交部长的电报中，希望他们就建立欧洲安全体系问题达成协议，以使两个德国都能参加。同时表示，为了在和平中重新统一，德国人自己必须取得谅解。为了达到这一目的，拟议中的全德委员会是适当的形式。
    波恩的法斯宾德教授六日在西德非战主义者举行的大会上讲话，也表示欢迎组织全德委员会的建议。
