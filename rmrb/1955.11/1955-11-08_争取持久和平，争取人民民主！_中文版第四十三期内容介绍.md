The 43rd issue of the Chinese edition of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, has been published.

This issue publishes in full Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" delivered at the meeting of secretaries of provincial, municipal, and district Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party on July 31 this year, and publishes excerpts of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on the question of agricultural cooperation. This issue published an editorial entitled "People of All Countries Strengthen Unity to Strive for Peace." The editorial said that the peace aspirations of the people of all countries have formed a great mass movement for peace, playing a huge role in the struggle to ease international tensions. Currently, the people of all countries are watching Geneva, where the Four Foreign Ministers Conference is being held. All good people in the world hope that the participants in this meeting will make new contributions to the cause of peace. Of course, no one will ignore the serious difficulties that the foreign ministers will encounter in resolving complex international problems. However, these difficulties can be overcome as long as all participants are willing to strengthen and develop the "Geneva spirit," are sincere in negotiations, seek common ground while reserving differences, strive for cooperation, strive to reach agreements, and have the desire to consolidate peace and world security. People from all walks of life in all countries will closely and vigilantly pay attention to the progress of the negotiations, and they will never tolerate anyone using the excuse that an agreement has not been reached on a certain issue on the agenda to overturn the achievements that have already been made, or use this to make this meeting a failure. This issue also published an article by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, entitled "Strengthening the Alliance of Workers and Land Laborers." Thorez's article pointed out that since its establishment, the French Communist Party has consistently been concerned with safeguarding the true interests of small farmers. The Communist Party advocates that tillers should own their land, and advocates returning the land seized by large landowners to the deprived. Therefore, the Communist Party is the party that struggles for the alliance of the working class and the laboring peasants. The reason why we must strengthen the alliance of workers and land laborers today is because both need to oppose the rampant economic offensive of capitalism, and oppose poverty and bankruptcy. French farmers will surely unite with the proletariat against exploitation and oppression. They will surely fight for socialism, because socialism will give French farmers full opportunities for development. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版第四十三期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第四十三期中文版已经出版。
    这一期全文刊载了毛泽东同志今年七月三十一日在中国共产党省委、市委和区党委书记会议上所作的报告——“关于农业合作化问题”，并且摘要刊载了中国共产党中央委员会第六次全体会议关于农业合作化问题的决议。这一期以“各国人民加强团结争取和平”为题发表了社论。社论说，各国人民的和平愿望已经形成为群众争取和平的伟大的运动，在争取缓和国际紧张局势的斗争中起了巨大的作用。目前，各国人民都注视着日内瓦，因为四国外长会议在那里召开。全世界善良的人都希望这个会议的参加者对和平事业作出新的贡献。当然，没有人会忽视外长们在解决复杂的国际问题时将要遇到的严重困难。但是，这些困难都是能够克服的，只要所有参加会议的人都愿意加强并发展“日内瓦精神”，在谈判的时候具有诚意，极力求同存异，努力争取合作，争取达成协议，具有巩固和平和世界安全的意愿。各国社会人士都将密切地、警惕地注意谈判的进展，他们决不会容忍任何人借口议程上的某一问题没有达成协议而推翻已经获得的成就，或者借此使这次会议遭受失败。这一期还刊载了法国共产党总书记莫·多列士的文章“加强工人和土地劳动者的联盟”。多列士的文章指出，法国共产党成立以来一贯地关心保卫小农的真正利益。共产党主张耕者有其田，主张把大土地所有者攫夺的土地还给被剥夺的人。因此，共产党是为工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟而斗争的党。我们今天之所以必须加强工人和土地劳动者的联盟，是因为两者都需要反对资本主义的猖獗的经济攻势，反对贫穷和破产。法国农民一定会同无产阶级团结起来反对剥削和压迫。他们一定会为社会主义而斗争，因为社会主义将使法国农民得到充分发展的机会。　（新华社）
