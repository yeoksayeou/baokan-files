　　Too Many or Too Few "Private Plots" Are Harmful
　　Jian Hong
    Agricultural cooperatives must handle the "private plots" of their members very appropriately. Too many or too few will affect the lives of the members and the consolidation of the cooperative.
    The Huoxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiafang Township, Lianhua County, Jiangxi Province, was established last year. At that time, the staff who helped establish the cooperative were afraid that if members kept land, it would affect investment and attendance. They mistakenly stipulated that "private land is not allowed at all." This opinion was widely opposed by the members. Later, it was changed to allow each person to keep only three or four li. Because too little land was kept, there were not enough vegetables to eat, which greatly affected the daily lives of the members. Women had the biggest opinions on this issue. They said: We eat chili peppers and side dishes every day, and pig feed cannot be separated from sweet potato vines. Now it's difficult everywhere. If I had known that joining the cooperative would be subject to this restriction, I wouldn't have joined! Some members opened up two or three fen of wasteland to grow more vegetables, but these were also "unified" by the cooperative. The vegetables eaten by the members and the feed for the pigs have to be collected from the keeper every day. This added a lot of trouble to the agricultural production cooperative, and it was also very inconvenient for the members themselves. A small number of members have stopped raising pigs because of this restriction.
    Contrary to this situation, some cooperatives have taken another deviation when dealing with the "private plot" issue, leaving too much for the members. In some cooperatives in Pingshan Township, Beiliu County, Guangxi Province, the assessment of production was not reasonable enough, and some members were not voluntary enough, so they adopted the method of "straddling two boats" and "joining a section and retaining a section," leaving a lot of land for private cultivation. In the seven cooperatives in the township, 1,049.13 mu of land was entered into the cooperative, and 139.15 mu were retained as private plots, accounting for 13 percent of the land entered into the cooperative. The local staff also felt that too much was being retained, but they were afraid that the members would not be willing if too little was retained, so they did not persuade the members and just acquiesced. When the production season arrived, the members with more private plots only cared about planting their own land and were unwilling to participate in the collective production of the cooperative. Not only that, but the production of the cooperative was not done well. In the Pengtongfen Agricultural Production Cooperative in the township, six members retained too much land. During the busy farming season in April this year, they worked an average of only eleven workdays in the cooperative. When the cooperative cadres asked them to work, they procrastinated and refused to go. Some even said: I will earn fewer work points if I work less, and I won't ask you for food in the future! The same was true for the Shengli Cooperative in Dazaozhuang Township, Wuqing County, Hebei. Due to the excessive amount of private plots, one-fifth of the members often did not work in the cooperative during the busy farming season, so that spring plowing and wheat planting could not be completed on time. Excessive land retention by members not only affected the members' production in the cooperative but also affected their normal working lives. Liu Changshan, a member of the Zang Fuzeng Cooperative in Dazaozhuang Township, retained three mu of good land for himself. He had to work in the cooperative and also take time in the morning, noon, and evening to work on his private plot. Overwork made him sick for more than a month, and the money he spent on medicine and the loss of work added up to more than the total income from the three mu of land.
    Leaving a small amount of land for the members is to take care of the members' need to grow vegetables. The amount of land retained should be determined according to the number of family members and the amount of local land, but it should not exceed 5 percent of the average land owned by each person in the whole village. Some rural workers unilaterally emphasize "everything unified" and are unwilling to leave the necessary "private plots" for the members, that is, they do not appropriately take care of the personal interests of the members under the premise of meeting the production needs of the cooperative, and the result will inevitably cause the members to object. They want to "take over" all the vegetables needed by the members. Countless experiences have long proved that this cannot be taken over no matter what. It cannot be taken over now, and it will still be impossible in the future. Of course, allowing members to retain too much land violates the principle of unified use of land by the cooperative, which will inevitably affect the consolidation and development of the agricultural cooperative, and cannot overcome or even encourage members to retain the habit of individual management. Which worker who is willing to develop socialism in the countryside can do this?

　　“自留地”过多过少都有害处
　　剑虹
    农业合作社处理社员的“自留地”要很适当，过多过少都会影响社员的生活和社的巩固。
    江西省莲花县下防乡火星农业生产合作社是去年建立的。当时帮助建社的工作人员害怕社员留了地，会影响投资和出工，错误地规定“一律不准留私地”；这个意见遭到社员的普遍反对，后来改成每人只准留三、四厘。因为留地太少，种的蔬菜不够吃，大大影响了社员的日常生活。妇女对这个问题的意见最大，她们说：辣椒小菜天天吃，喂猪离不了薯藤，现在处处困难了，早知道入社受这个限制，我才不入哩！有的社员为了多种些蔬菜，自己开了两、三分荒地，也被合作社“统一”去了。社员吃的蔬菜、喂猪的饲料，天天要向保管员领。这样，农业生产合作社添了许多麻烦，社员自己也很不方便。少数社员受了这个限制，已经不养猪了。
    同这种情形相反，有些合作社处理“自留地”问题的时候，发生了另一种偏向，给社员留的过多了。广西省北流县平山乡有些合作社评产不够合理，有些社员不够自愿，就采取“脚蹬两只船”“入一截留一截”的办法，把许多土地留下自耕。全乡七个社，入社土地一千零四十九点一三亩，自留地就有一百三十九点一五亩，占入社土地的百分之十三。当地工作人员也觉得留的太多，但是害怕留少了社员不愿意，他们不向社员进行说服教育，就这样迁就下来了。到了生产季节，自留地多的社员，只顾种自己的地，不愿意参加社里的集体生产。他们不仅这样，社的生产就搞不好了。该乡朋同分农业生产合作社有六户社员留地过多，今年四月份农忙的时候，平均每人只在社里作了十一个工。社干部去叫他们作工，他们推推拖拖不肯去，有的还说：我少出工少得工分，以后没吃的也不向你们要！河北武清县大枣庄乡胜利社也是这样。由于自留地过多，在农忙的时候，经常有五分之一的社员不到社里干活，以致春耕、种麦都不能按时完成任务。社员留地过多，不仅影响社员在社内生产，甚至影响了社员正常的劳动生活。大枣庄乡臧福增社的社员刘长山，自己留下三亩好地。他要在社里干活，还要抽早晨、中午和晚上的休息时间，在自留地里劳动。过度的劳动累得他病了一个多月，把吃药用的钱和误工受的损失加起来，比三亩地的全部收入还要多。
    给社员留下少量的土地，是为了照顾社员种植蔬菜的需要。留地多少，应该按照社员家庭人口和当地土地多少而定，但是最多不能超过全村每口人所有土地的平均数的百分之五。有些农村工作人员片面强调“一切统一”，不愿意给社员留下必要的“自留地”，也就是没有在满足合作社的生产需要的前提下，适当照顾社员个人的利益，结果必然引起社员的反对。他们想把社员需要的蔬菜都“包下来”，无数经验早已证明，这无论如何是包不了的。现在包不了，将来仍然不可能。当然，让社员留地过多，违背了合作社统一使用土地的原则，就必然影响农业合作社的巩固和发展，就不能克服甚至会鼓励社员保留个体经营的习惯。哪一个愿意在农村发展社会主义的工作人员能够这样办呢？
