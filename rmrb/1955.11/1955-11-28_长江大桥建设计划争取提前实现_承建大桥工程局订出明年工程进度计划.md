　　Yangtze River Bridge Construction Plan Strives for Early Completion
　　Bridge Engineering Bureau Formulates Next Year's Construction Progress Plan
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 27th) The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau completed the compilation of the 1956 basic construction plan in mid-November and decided to strive for early completion of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge construction plan.

    In late October, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau, based on the overall progress schedule of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge approved by the State Council and in combination with the estimated completion of this year's plan, initially drafted an outline of the 1956 basic construction plan. However, after studying the First Five-Year Plan and the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, the leadership of the Engineering Bureau deeply felt that this plan outline could no longer adapt to the development requirements of the objective situation. In particular, after studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the entire bureau focused on criticizing the conservative thinking of some cadres in compiling the plan who did not estimate existing potential and mass enthusiasm, and on the basis of comprehensive planning work, considered how to make the construction progress even earlier. According to this new requirement, the previously drafted plan outline was revised in mid-November, and the basic construction plan for 1956 was officially compiled.

    According to the requirements of the new plan, the most difficult and critical project of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge - the eight underwater bridge piers - must be fully constructed in 1956. Among them, the construction of piers No. 1, 2, and 8 must be fully completed, and other piers must complete the sinking of pipe columns, the concrete of the cap, and part of the foundation works; the approach bridges on both sides are required to reach the railway line elevation. Parts below the highway surface that do not affect the erection of steel beams, as well as prefabricated reinforced concrete beams, must also be fully completed; in addition, the Hanyang side connecting railway line and highway line are required to reach the bridgehead, and the upper and lower structures of the Wuchang side connecting line and all overpasses must also be completed in 1956. The plan also determined that the first span of steel beams of the Yangtze River Bridge will begin to be erected in 1956. If the steel beams can be delivered in time, efforts will be made to erect more. In addition, all auxiliary and supporting projects on both sides of the Yangtze River are also required to be fully completed in 1956.

    The compilation of this plan has greatly encouraged all employees of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau. They proposed that under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, they would ensure the completion and over-completion of the 1956 basic construction plan, and be sure to complete the construction task of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge ahead of schedule.

### 长江大桥建设计划争取提前实现  承建大桥工程局订出明年工程进度计划

　　长江大桥建设计划争取提前实现
　  承建大桥工程局订出明年工程进度计划
    本报武汉二十七日电　武汉长江大桥工程局已经在十一月中旬完成了一九五六年度基本建设计划的编制工作，并决定争取提前完成武汉长江大桥的建设计划。
    十月下旬，武汉长江大桥工程局曾根据国务院批准的武汉长江大桥总进度表，结合今年计划预计完成情况，初步拟订了一九五六年度基本建设计划轮廓。但是，在学习第一个五年计划和党的七届六中全会文件以后，工程局领导方面深感这个计划轮廓已不能适应客观形势的发展要求，特别是学习了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以后，全局着重批判了部分干部在编制计划时不估计现有潜力和群众热情的保守思想，并在全面规划工作的基础上，考虑了如何使建设进度再行提前的可能性。根据这个新的要求，在十一月中旬对过去初步拟订的计划轮廓进行了修改，正式编制成一九五六年度的基本建设计划。
    根据新计划的要求，武汉长江大桥正桥最艰巨的关键工程——八个水中桥墩要在一九五六年内全面施工，其中一、二、八号桥墩工程要全部完成，其他各桥墩要完成管柱下沉、承台混凝土和部分基础工程；两岸引桥要求达到铁路线标高，公路面以下在不影响架设钢梁的部分及钢筋混凝土预制梁，也要全部完成；另外，汉阳岸联络线铁路线和公路线要求达到桥头，武昌岸联络线的上下部建筑和所有跨线桥也要在一九五六年内完工。计划中还确定：一九五六年将开始架设长江大桥的第一孔钢梁，如果钢梁能及时运到，还争取多架。另外，长江两岸的全部附属工程和辅助工程，也要求在一九五六年内全部完成。
    这个计划的编制，使武汉长江大桥工程局全体职工受到很大的鼓舞，他们提出在党的领导下和苏联专家的帮助下，保证完成并超额完成一九五六年度的基本建设计划，一定要提前完成武汉长江大桥的建设任务。
