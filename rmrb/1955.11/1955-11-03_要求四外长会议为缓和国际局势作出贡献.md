    Demanding the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to Contribute to Easing the International Situation
    World Federation of Trade Unions Writes to the Four Foreign Ministers
    Demanding the Foreign Ministers' Conference Be Conducted in an Atmosphere of Understanding
    According to TASS, Vienna, November 2nd: The World Federation of Trade Unions issued a letter to the Foreign Ministers of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union.
    The letter stated: The Four Heads of Government Conference received a very enthusiastic response from the working people of all countries, who warmly welcomed these initial achievements of the policy of easing tensions. The letter requested that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference be conducted in an atmosphere of mutual understanding in line with the Geneva spirit.
    The letter pointed out that millions of working people are uneasy because a group of figures hostile to improving international relations has launched activities threatening the success of the negotiations. The letter said: International tensions and the arms race they cause seriously affect the working and living conditions of workers. Therefore, the working class of all countries urgently hopes to further ease international tensions, to greatly reduce armaments, and demands the elimination of the threat of atomic war. All working people hope to improve relations in all aspects between the East and the West, and they first hope that governments will not hinder the development of international ties between trade unions.
    The letter stated: The Paris Agreements are an obstacle to resolving the issue of restoring German unification. Establishing a European collective security system would make the peaceful resolution of the German unification issue possible. The working people eagerly hope that the negotiations will achieve further success, and are prepared to do everything in their power to consolidate these achievements, because achieving these achievements will make it possible for them to obtain security and improve the situation of the working people.
    Many French Cities and Towns Hold Rallies
    Demanding the Success of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference
    According to TASS, Paris: Many cities and villages in France have recently held rallies one after another. Resolutions were passed at the meetings, hoping for the success of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    A rally with a large number of participants was held in Montceau-les-Mines, Saône-et-Loire province, on October 30. Prominent activists from local organizations of the Socialist Party, Communist Party, and Radical Socialist Party participated in the rally. Representatives of the West German Committee for the Defense of Peace also participated in the rally. The meeting elected a delegation to go to Geneva to express to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference the wish of the French peace supporters for the success of the conference.
    The Presidium of the French National Peace Council issued a statement saying that the French public hopes that the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference will "turn the hopes that the people of all countries have placed on the consultations of the four governments into concrete actions." The statement urged the French representative attending the Geneva meeting to implement policies that are in line with the national interests of France and promote world peace.
    German People Write Letters to the Four Foreign Ministers One After Another
    Demanding a Solution to European Security and the German Question
    According to the German News Agency: The German people are writing letters to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference one after another, requesting the conference to contribute to maintaining European security and promoting the resolution of the German question.
    More than 5,000 workers at the state-owned Carl Liebknecht hard coal factory in the German Democratic Republic wrote to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, requesting the Four Foreign Ministers to respect the principles stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement for guaranteeing the genuine democratic development of the German people.
    The letter from peace advocates in Bremen, West Germany, requested the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference to make resolutions on ending the "Cold War" and on disarmament. The local committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany in Nauhausen and peace advocates in Lemscheid, West Germany, jointly wrote to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, requesting the establishment of a European collective security system that includes the two Germanys. The letter emphasized that this is the most effective way to resolve the German question.
    Vietnam Peace Committee Cables the Foreign Ministers' Conference
    Hoping that the Four Foreign Ministers Will Pay Attention to the Far East Issue
    According to the Vietnam News Agency: The Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace held an enlarged meeting on October 31 and passed a telegram to the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. The telegram wished the Foreign Ministers' Conference success, and believed that while discussing European issues, the Foreign Ministers' Conference should pay attention to various Far Eastern issues, including the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Indochina.
    The telegram pointed out that "the situation in Indochina and the situation in Taiwan and Korea remain tense." After pointing out the conspiracy of "the Ngo Dinh Diem government on October 23, 1955, forcibly forcing the people of the South to recognize Ngo Dinh Diem as president, and Ngo Dinh Diem is trying to formulate a separate constitution and establish a separate 'congress' in South Vietnam," the telegram said: This action violates the Geneva Accords and the final declaration of the Geneva Conference, and its purpose is to permanently split Vietnam and make the South hostile to the North.
