　　Why Important Equipment for Tunnel Construction Has Been Backlogged for a Long Time

　　Editor:
    Due to the needs of tunnel construction on the Baocheng Railway, the Tunnel Engineering Company of the New Railway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways requested the New Railway Engineering Bureau to allocate twenty battery-powered locomotives (with a full set of charging equipment) to them before February of this year. They waited and waited, and it was not until the end of May this year that this batch of important mechanized tunnel construction equipment was transported to Baoji. Upon opening the boxes, it was discovered that chargers were missing, rendering them unusable. Although the Tunnel Engineering Company promptly wrote a report, the New Railway Engineering Bureau delayed sending a portion of the chargers until September. To add insult to injury, these chargers were also missing starting controllers and distribution panels, forcing the Tunnel Engineering Company to purchase them on their own. By late October, a portion of these battery-powered locomotives could finally be used; however, Tunnel No. 36 of the First Engineering Section had already been completed, and the Yangpingguan and Enjiaoshi tunnels in the Jinlue section were on the verge of completion, with the other tunnel projects largely finished. Now, despite efforts to allocate as much as possible, nine battery-powered locomotives remain, destined to be shelved and used on newly constructed lines next year.
    Within the Ministry of Railways' New Railway Engineering Bureau system, due to the irresponsibility of staff, inadequate planning of materials and machinery, and mismanagement, the incidents of backlog and waste are far from limited to this one case. For example, the Tunnel Engineering Company currently has five categories of materials, including air compressors and pneumatic drill accessories, worth more than 142.8 million yuan, lying idle. In 1953, when they were allocating state treasury materials in Kunming, due to the mentality of being overly broad in their estimates and wanting to be prepared for anything, they also allocated pneumatic drill accessories that were not needed, causing long-term backlog of state funds. Last year, when this company promoted water-powered drilling construction, the company's supply station ordered 60 water tanks, but due to incorrect specifications and unsuitability for use in the tunnels, they have been backlogged for more than a year.
    The state has invested huge sums of money to build new railways. Every penny of these valuable funds should be used in the most needed areas. Such phenomena of backlog and waste cannot be allowed.

### 为什么长期积压了隧道施工的重要设备

　　为什么长期积压了隧道施工的重要设备编辑同志：
    铁道部新建铁路工程总局隧道工程公司由于宝成路隧道施工的需要，在去年年底要求新建铁路工程总局在今年二月以前拨给他们二十台电瓶机车
  （附全套充电设备）。左盼右盼，一直盼到今年五月末，这批隧道机械化施工的重要设备才运到宝鸡。开箱一看，却缺少充电机，不能使用。隧道工程公司虽然及时写了报告，但是新建铁路工程总局拖延到九月才送来一部分充电机。叫人啼笑皆非的是，这些充电机又缺少起动控制器和配电盘等设备，隧道工程公司只好自己设法购制。到了十月下旬，这批电瓶机车总算有一部分可以使用了；但是第一工程处第三十六号隧道已经打通，锦略段阳平关和恩角石两个隧道眼看就要完工，其他隧道工程也已经完成了一大半。现在，虽然经过尽量调拨，还剩下九台电瓶机车只好搁到明年调往修建的新线路上去使用。
    在铁道部新建铁路总局系统中，由于工作人员不负责任，对于材料、机械计划不周和管理不当而造成积压浪费的事件，远不止这一起。例如，隧道工程公司现在积压的空气压缩机和风钻配件等五项材料，就达一十四万二千八百多万元。一九五三年他们在昆明调拨国库物资的时候，由于宽打窄用和有备无患的思想作祟，把用不着的风钻配件也一并调进来，使国家资金长期积压。去年，这个公司推行水风钻施工的时候，由公司经租站订制水箱六十个，但是由于规格不对头，不合峒内使用，积压了一年多。
    国家为了新建铁道，投入巨额的资金。这些宝贵的资金，每一文钱都应该用到最需要的地方去。这种积压浪费的现象是不能允许的。
