    Cultural Exchange is an Important Factor in Promoting International Cooperation
    Su Xin
    The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has begun the discussion of its third item on the agenda – the issue of developing contacts between East and West. In order to further ease international tensions, the people of all countries expect the four foreign ministers to broadly exchange views and reach agreements on this topic.
    The primary issue in developing East-West contact is the restoration of normal international trade. Only on the basis of international economic development is it possible to truly strengthen East-West contact. However, this does not negate the significant role of cultural exchange and broad interaction among people of various countries in promoting international cooperation. Through cultural exchanges and mutual visits between countries, the people of all nations can eliminate estrangement, enhance understanding, and communicate ideas, thereby helping to establish and strengthen trust and cooperation among them. Broad contact and interaction between countries with different social systems is particularly important. As Indian Prime Minister Nehru recently stated at the 10th Congress of the International Union of Official Travel Organizations, "People are traveling more freely and coming into contact with people of other countries, and discovering that, however different the places, there is still some basic common factor."
    There are clearly two different attitudes and situations in dealing with this issue.
    The Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democracies have consistently advocated the development of international cultural exchange and friendly contact among the people of all countries. They respect the culture of all countries, large and small, and hope that international cultural exchange will become an important tool for promoting international cooperation.
    The efforts made by the socialist camp countries in recent years to enhance international cultural exchange and broad contact among people of all countries are obvious to all. In 1954 alone, the Soviet Union received approximately 10,000 guests from more than 90 countries, including social figures, scientists, writers, artists, and other various people with different beliefs and viewpoints. At the same time, the Soviet Union sent various delegations totaling 7,000 people to visit countries in Europe, the Americas, Asia, and Africa. On February 9th of this year, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a declaration emphasizing the importance of establishing direct contact between the parliaments of various countries and exchanging parliamentary delegations. This declaration was accepted by the parliaments of many countries and played a significant role in promoting direct contact between countries. After the declaration was issued, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union exchanged visits with parliamentary delegations from many capitalist countries. At the same time, Soviet agricultural workers, construction workers, scientists, artists, and athletes have also conducted mutual visits and exchanged experiences with their counterparts in many countries this year. Thanks to the facilities provided by the Soviet government, several thousand foreign travelers have recently toured various parts of the Soviet Union in the past two months.
    The People's Republic of China has always adopted a positive attitude towards carrying out international cultural exchange and establishing friendly contact among the people of all countries. In this regard, there are indeed objective difficulties. That is, some Western countries deliberately create various artificial obstacles to prevent their people from understanding the truth about the new China. But even so, our country still strives to promote various contacts between countries. In the five years before August of last year, our country sent more than 700 science, literature, art, and sports delegations to visit more than 20 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, and at the same time received various delegations and individuals from all over the world. As of October 15th of this year, there were 40 large-scale art troupes, totaling 4,064 people, who came to our country to perform. Since the beginning of this year, China's foreign cultural ties have been further expanded. A total of over 40 countries' delegations and people of different professions and beliefs were invited to visit China and participate in our National Day celebrations. At the same time, our art, cultural, religious, and sports delegations also visited and performed in many countries in Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, contacting the people of these countries and establishing good friendships.
    Facts show that mutual exchanges between the people of socialist camp countries and capitalist countries can have a positive impact on enhancing mutual understanding and close relations, and especially help to eliminate the suspicion and distrust deliberately created by the "Cold War" advocates among the people of all countries. For example, Lambert, the head of the American agricultural delegation that recently visited the Soviet Union, said: "Only through this direct contact between the Soviet people and the American people can we achieve better mutual understanding between our two peoples. This mutual understanding and mutual respect is the most important way to consolidate lasting world peace and future progress." American Democratic Senator Allen, who recently visited Poland, the Soviet Union, Romania, and Hungary, also said: "My impressions are very different from what I previously got from the U.S. State Department's news. I saw a lot and talked to people a lot, which convinced me that they do not want any war." The Finnish newspaper "Helsingin Sanomat," in commenting on the visit and performance of the Chinese Classical Song and Dance Troupe in Finland, pointed out the role of art in communicating the voices of the people of all countries. The newspaper wrote that the Chinese classical song and dance art, which reflects the life of the Chinese people, "shortened the distance between China and Finland."
    But unfortunately, not all countries treat the issue of international cultural exchange with a positive attitude. Some countries deliberately set up various roadblocks on the road to East-West contact. Like in international political and economic affairs, they apply "Cold War" tactics to all aspects of international cultural exchange, attempting to spread elements of mutual suspicion and fear between countries with different social systems.
    The "Cold War" policy is one of the fundamental reasons why international cultural exchange has not been widely developed in recent years. In the past few years, many Soviet artists, scientists, athletes, and other people who were invited by the American people have been unable to travel due to various difficulties and restrictions imposed by the American authorities. At the same time, many Americans have been unable to leave the United States to visit foreign countries because they could not obtain passports. For example, the fact that the American genius black singer Robeson and writer Howard Fast were obstructed from traveling abroad is well known. American artist Rockwell Kent, who wanted to go abroad to paint, also encountered the same situation. The famous film artist Chaplin recently sent a telegram to Rockwell Kent, in which he denounced this restriction imposed on American citizens. He said: "Due to the unreasonable refusal to issue passports, the right of travel of every free person has been increasingly violated."
    It needs to be specifically pointed out that although the responsible persons of some Western countries have recently verbally expressed their willingness to develop East-West contact, they have not taken effective measures to eliminate the artificial barriers to East-West contact that still exist. Some people even do not welcome certain progress that has already emerged in East-West contact. In this regard, people cannot but notice the remarks made by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles at a recent press conference. He believed that the American people's sincere feelings of hoping to be friendly with the Soviet people, as expressed when welcoming the Soviet agricultural delegation, were "not very good" and expressed his unwillingness to see this kind of thing "repeated." Some spokespersons of the U.S. State Department also said that the idea of sending American actors to the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies to perform the opera "Porgy and Bess" by the famous American composer George Gershwin "is politically premature." In fact, people cannot but think that such remarks are just an excuse against international cultural exchange.
    All these run counter to the wishes of the people of all countries. International cultural exchange and the broad contact of people from all walks of life are important steps to promote international cooperation. The people of all countries demand that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference seriously discuss and implement the instructions given to them by the heads of the four governments and achieve positive results in eliminating artificial barriers to East-West contact.

### 文化交流是增进国际合作的重要因素

    文化交流是增进国际合作的重要因素
    苏新
    四国外长会议已开始了第三项议程——关于发展东西方之间的接触问题——的讨论。为了进一步缓和国际局势，各国人民期望四国外长在这个议题上广泛地交换意见并达成协议。
    发展东西方接触的首要问题，是恢复国际间的正常贸易。只有在国际经济发展的基础上，才有可能真正地加强东西方的接触。但这并不等于否认文化交流和各国人士的广泛交往对于增进国际合作的重大作用。通过各国之间的文化交流和相互访问，就能使各国人民消除隔阂、增进了解和沟通思想，从而有助于建立和加强各国人民之间的信任和合作。在不同社会制度的国家之间进行广泛的接触往来，尤其重要。这正像印度总理尼赫鲁最近在国际官方旅行组织联合会第十届大会上所说的“人们更加自由地往来和同其他国家的人民进行接触，并且去发现，无论怎样不同的地方，仍然有某种基本的共同因素。”
    在对待这一问题上，显然存在着两种不同的态度和情况。
    苏联、中国和各人民民主国家是一贯主张发展国际文化交流和各国人民之间的友好接触的。它们尊重一切大小国家的文化，并且希望国际文化交流成为促进国际合作的重要工具。
    社会主义阵营各国近年来为增进国际文化交流和各国人士广泛接触而作的努力是人所共见的。仅仅在一九五四年，苏联就曾接待了来自九十多个国家的来宾约一万名，其中包括具有不同信仰和不同见解的社会名流、科学家、作家、艺术家和其他各种人士。同时，苏联也派出了为数达七千人的各种代表团访问欧洲、美洲、亚洲和非洲各国。今年二月九日，苏联最高苏维埃发表宣言，强调建立各国议会之间的直接接触和互派议会代表团的重要性。这个宣言为许多国家的议会所接受，在促进各国之间的直接接触上起了很大的作用。在这个宣言发表以后，苏联最高苏维埃同许多资本主义国家的议会互相派遣代表团进行了访问。同时，苏联的农业工作者、建筑工作者、科学家、艺术家和运动员今年以来也同许多国家的同行们进行了相互访问和交流经验。由于苏联政府所提供的便利，最近两个月来有好几千名外国旅行者到苏联各地作了参观旅行。
    中华人民共和国对于开展国际文化交流和建立各国人民之间的友谊接触，一向采取积极的态度。在这方面，并不是没有客观困难的。这就是某些西方国家故意建立各种人为的障碍，不让它们的人民了解新中国的真相。但即使如此，我国还是努力促进国与国间的各种接触。在去年八月以前的五年内，我国曾派出科学、文学、艺术和体育代表团共七百余人访问了亚洲、欧洲、美洲的二十多个国家，同时接待了来自世界各国的各种代表团和个人。截至今年十月十五日为止，仅仅来我国进行访问演出的大型艺术团体就有四十个，共四千零六十四人。今年以来，我国的对外文化联系更形扩大。应邀前来我国访问并参加我国国庆观礼的，共有四十多个国家的各种代表团和具有不同职业与信仰的各种人士。同时，我国的艺术、文化、宗教和体育代表团也到亚洲、中近东和欧洲的许多国家去作了访问和演出，同这些国家的人民进行接触并建立了良好的友谊。
    事实表明，社会主义阵营各国同资本主义国家人民之间的相互往来，对于增进彼此了解和密切相互关系是能够发生积极影响的，特别是有助于消除那些“冷战”鼓吹者在各国人民之间故意制造的猜忌和疑虑。例如，不久以前访问苏联的美国农业代表团团长兰伯特就这样说过：“只有通过苏联人民和美国人民的这种直接接触，我们才能在我们两国人民之间达到更好的相互谅解。这种相互谅解和相互尊重是巩固世界持久和平和今后进步的最重要的方法”。最近访问过波兰、苏联、罗马尼亚和匈牙利的美国民主党参议员埃伦大也说：“我的印象同我以前在美国国务院消息中所得到的印象大不相同。我看了很多，同人们谈得很多，这使我相信，他们是不要任何战争的”。芬兰报纸“赫尔辛基新闻”在评论中国古典歌舞团在芬兰访问演出时指出了艺术在沟通各国人民心声上的作用。该报写道：反映中国人民生活的中国古典歌舞艺术“缩短了中国与芬兰之间的距离”。
    但可惜的是，并不是所有国家都是以积极的态度来对待国际文化交流这个问题的。某些国家在东西方接触的道路上故意设置各种路障。它们也像在国际政治和经济事务中一样，把“冷战”的手段应用到了国际文化交流的各个方面，企图借此在不同社会制度的国家之间散布互相猜疑和恐惧的因素。
    “冷战”政策是近年来国际文化交流不能得到广泛发展的根本原因之一。在过去几年内，受到美国人民邀请的许多苏联艺术家、科学家、运动员和其他人士，因为美国当局的种种刁难和限制而未能成行。同时，许多美国人士也因为得不到出国护照而一直未能离开美国到国外去访问。例如，美国天才的黑人歌唱家罗伯逊和作家霍华德·法斯特的出国愿望受到阻挠的事实是谁都知道的。想到国外去作画的美国艺术家罗克威尔·肯特也碰到了同样的遭遇。著名的电影艺术家卓别麟最近在打给罗克威尔·肯特的电报中，曾斥责了强加在美国公民身上的这种限制。他说：“由于不讲理地拒绝发给护照，已经使每个自由人的旅行权利受到越来越多的侵犯”。
    需要特别指出的是，虽然某些西方国家的负责人士最近也在口头上表示开展东西方接触的愿望，但是却并没有采取有效的措施来消除迄今尚存的东西方接触的人为障碍。有些人甚至对已经出现的东西方接触的某些进展也不表欢迎。在这方面人们不能不注意到美国国务卿杜勒斯在最近举行的一次记者招待会上的谈话。他认为美国人民在欢迎苏联农业代表团时所表露出来的希望同苏联人民友好的真情是“不大好的”，并且表示不愿看到这种事情“再重复发生”。美国国务院的一些发言人也说，现在由美国派遣演员到苏联和人民民主国家去演出美国著名作曲家乔治·葛许温的歌剧“波吉与白丝”的想法，“在政治上是为时过早的”。实际上，人们不能不认为这样的言论只是一种反对国际文化交流的遁辞而已。
    所有这些都是同各国人民的愿望相违背的。国际文化交流和各界人士的广泛接触是增进国际合作的重要步骤。各国人民要求四国外长会议认真地讨论和执行四国政府首脑给他们的指示，在消除东西方接触的人为障碍上取得积极的成果。
