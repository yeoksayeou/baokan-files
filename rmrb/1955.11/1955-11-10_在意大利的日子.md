    Days in Italy
    Zhao Feng, Deputy Head of the Chinese Art Troupe

    The Chinese Art Troupe gave performances in six Italian cities—Venice, Milan, Turin, Florence, Naples, and Rome—and received the same warm welcome as in other Western European countries. The Art Troupe participated in the 18th International Festival of Contemporary Music in Venice. Italian public opinion fully recognized the significance of the Chinese Art Troupe's tour in promoting mutual understanding between the Chinese and Italian people. It was the first time the Italian public had come into contact with Chinese classical opera, an art form that was both unfamiliar in content and novel in form. However, due to the Italian people's widespread friendliness towards the new China and the accessible nature of Chinese classical opera, the Italian public quickly accepted and appreciated it. As the Rome newspaper "Avanti!" commented:
    "The reason for the astonishing success of Chinese opera lies in the fact that this art is entirely comprehensible to us. Although the Chinese people are culturally very distant from us, this is mainly because Chinese opera is deeply rooted in the traditions of the people. This opera values rhythm, and perfectly organizes singing, dancing, music, and expression. Their performance and the object they want to perform are completely combined, and their performance and the purpose of the performance are clearly linked together." Rome's "Unità" said: "This drama is loved by everyone, it can be said that because from behind this art we can see a people and a civilization moving forward. This is ancient drama, but it shows its youth because of its vitality."
    The Chinese Art Troupe made extensive contact with people from all walks of life in Italy. What impressed us most was the Italian people's universal desire for peace. The Italian people clearly understand that war will bring infinite suffering to people's lives and heartbreaking destruction to cultural treasures. In Milan, we visited a beautiful museum, the building of which was bombed into ruins at the end of World War II. Many beautiful stone columns, roof decorations, and sculptures can no longer be restored. In Florence, in a large theater with a capacity of three to four thousand spectators where the Art Troupe performed, there was a row of beautiful Roman-style columns, and the auditorium was like an ancient Roman theater, but this theater had also been partially destroyed. It is precisely because the Italian people have this strong desire for peace that the performances of the Chinese Art Troupe have resonated with all sectors of Italian society, and as the mayors of these cities said when welcoming us, the Chinese Art Troupe, as cultural envoys and peace envoys, has made important contributions to promoting friendly relations between the two great ancient civilizations of East and West.
    During its tour in Italy, the Chinese Art Troupe, despite being very busy, still tried its best to come into contact with and learn from Italy's outstanding cultural traditions. The majestic architectural ruins of ancient Rome could not but amaze us at the height of architectural art and technology that could be achieved hundreds of years before the Christian era. The exquisite architecture of the Renaissance era turned the entire city of Venice into a museum and a garden. We saw the sculptures of the great Michelangelo, whose characters' emotions reached extreme depth and truth. In the series of brilliant painters in Italy, we cannot forget the immortal masters such as Giorgione, da Vinci, and Raphael, who achieved a high degree of harmony and unity on the screen and the beauty of the characters' inner emotions and character. All of these not only gave our artists a deep impression and directly contributed to their future artistic creation, and not only enabled us to have a further understanding of Italy's outstanding culture, but more importantly, facing the outstanding achievements of the world's progressive human culture, we have become more firm in our belief in striving for perfect artistic creation to serve the people and in our determination to do everything possible to protect these human cultural treasures.
    The Chinese Art Troupe had peer-like contact with famous Italian artists in music, drama, film, dance, painting, and other fields, exchanged views on artistic creation, and learned many valuable experiences from Italian artists. The excellent working conditions and clear working objectives of our country's artists can be clearly seen from the performances of the Chinese Art Troupe. Italian artists unanimously praised our achievements in inheriting national traditions, just as Rome's "Unità" said: "Chinese opera provides us with a solution to the main problems that currently exist in our art, that is, how to inherit national traditions." Italian artists, like the Italian public, particularly praised the realistic elements and lyrical characteristics of some programs in Chinese classical opera. The "Milan Evening Post" commented: "This dramatic art and the typical and refined methods of action depict a beautiful and fantastic artistic conception. But this wonderful technique is based on realism, and thus gives people a strong sense of real life." Italian artists and the public are particularly interested in the wide circulation and extremely popular nature of Chinese classical opera among the people. Many people believe that artworks can only be continuously improved and gradually perfected through long-term testing by the audience. Italian public opinion also universally mentioned the profound popular characteristics of Chinese classical opera, so although some newspapers discussed the symbolism, abstract art, and religious style of Chinese classical opera, they all unanimously praised the characteristic of Chinese opera combining with the masses and forming an important part of the masses' lives. Milan's "Avanti!" said: "It is in this drama that we can see the eternal Chinese people, the simple, imaginative, legendary national temperament and the spirit of the people." Some of these friends' praises exceed our existing level. The entire staff of the Chinese Art Troupe deeply appreciates their encouragement and expectations.
    The Italian public warmly hoped that the Chinese Art Troupe would extend its performance period or be able to perform in Italy again. Regrettably, the Art Troupe had to leave Italy immediately to continue its European tour. But as the Deputy Minister of the Italian Ministry of Performing Arts stated, Italy and China should frequently exchange such theater groups. We also firmly believe that strengthening the understanding between the people of the two great ancient cultures of East and West through cultural relations, and clarifying the misunderstandings or even misinterpretations caused by the lack of contact, will greatly help the cause of world peace.

    在意大利的日子
    中国艺术团副团长　赵沨
    中国艺术团在意大利的威尼斯、米兰、都灵、佛罗伦萨、那不勒斯、罗马六个城市作了旅行演出，受到了与在西欧其它国家同样的欢迎。艺术团在威尼斯参加了第十八届国际现代音乐节。意大利舆论充分地估计到中国艺术团的旅行演出对于促进中意两国人民相互了解的意义。意大利公众第一次接触到中国古典戏剧，这种艺术在内容上对他们是陌生的，在形式上对他们是新奇的，但是由于意大利人民普遍地对新中国的友好和中国古典戏剧通俗易晓的特点，意大利公众很快就接受并且欣赏了中国戏剧。正如罗马的“前进报”的评论所说：
  “中国戏剧得到惊人成功的原因，在于这种艺术完全为我们所理解，尽管中国人民与我们的文化相距很远，这主要是因为中国戏剧在人民的传统里深深地生了根。这种戏剧重视格律，把歌、舞、音乐、表情完美地组织起来，他们的表演和他们所要表演的对象，是完全结合起来的，他们的表演和表演的目的是清楚地联系起来的。”罗马的“团结报”说：“这种戏剧之所以为大家喜爱，可以说是因为从这种艺术的后面我们可以看到一个前进中的人民和前进中的文明。这是古老的戏剧，但由于他的生命力而又显示出它的青春”。
    中国艺术团和意大利各阶层的公众作了广泛的接触。给我们印象最深刻的是意大利人民普遍的爱好和平的意愿，意大利人民清楚地了解，战争将要带给人民生活以无限的痛苦和对文化财富的痛心的摧毁。在米兰，我们参观了一个美丽的博物馆，而这个博物馆的建筑在第二次世界大战的末期曾被轰炸成为废墟，许多美丽的石柱和屋顶装饰、雕塑现在已经不能复原了。在佛罗伦萨，就在艺术团上演的一个容纳三四千观众的大剧场，这个剧场有一排排的美丽的罗马式的柱子，观众厅就像罗马的古剧场那样，但是这个剧场也曾经被部分炸毁。正是由于意大利人民有着这种强烈的爱好和平的意愿，中国艺术团的演出才得到了意大利社会各阶层的普遍共鸣，也正如这些城市的市长们在欢迎我们的时候所说的那样，中国艺术团作为文化的使节和和平的使节，已经对促进东西方两大文明古国之间的友好关系作出了重要的贡献。
    中国艺术团在意大利旅行演出期间，尽管在非常繁忙的情况下，也仍然尽量接触并学习意大利的优秀文化传统。古罗马的雄伟的建筑遗址，使我们不能不惊奇于能在纪元前数百年达到如此高度的建筑艺术和技术的水平。文艺复兴时代的精美的建筑，使威尼斯整个城市变成了博物馆和花园。我们看到了伟大的米开朗琪罗的雕塑，人物情绪达到了极度的深刻和真实。在意大利一连串的光辉的画家的名字行列中，我们不能忘记佐尔佐内、芬奇、拉菲尔等不朽的大师在画面上达到的高度的和谐统一和人物的内在情操和性格的美丽。所有这些，不仅给予我们艺术家以深刻的印象并直接有助于他们今后的艺术创造，也不仅使我们对意大利的优秀文化有了进一步的认识和了解，更重要的是我们面对着世界进步人类文化的优秀成果，更加坚定了我们努力追求完美的艺术创造以服务于人民的信念和全力来保卫这些人类文化财富的信心。
    中国艺术团同意大利的音乐、戏剧、电影、舞蹈、绘画各方面的著名艺术家作了同行式的接触，交流了有关艺术创造的意见，并向意大利艺术家们学习到不少宝贵的经验。我国艺术家们的优良的工作条件和明确的工作目的，从中国艺术团的演出中就可以清楚地看到。意大利艺术家们一致赞美我们在继承民族传统上所获得的成就，正像罗马“团结报”所说：“中国戏剧提供给我们解决我们艺术上目前存在的主要问题的办法，那就是如何继承民族传统的问题。”意大利的艺术家们和意大利的公众一样，都特别称赞中国古典戏剧的现实主义因素和某些节目的抒情的特点。“米兰晚报”评论指出：“这种戏剧艺术和动作的典型化、洗练化的方法描绘出一幅优美的幻想的意境。但这种奇妙的手法是基于现实主义的基础之上的，因而也就给予人们以强烈的生活现实感”。意大利的艺术家和公众特别对中国古典戏剧在民间的广泛流传和极度通俗的性质感到强烈的兴趣，很多人认为艺术品只有在观众中长期地考验，才能达到不断的提高和逐步的完美。意大利的舆论也普遍提到中国古典戏剧这种深刻的人民性的特点，所以虽然有些报纸在讨论中国古典戏剧的象征主义、抽象艺术和宗教风格，但也都一致地赞美中国戏剧和群众结合而形成为群众生活的重要构成部份这一特点。米兰“前进报”说：“就在这种戏剧中我们能看到永恒的中国人民，朴素的充满想像的传奇的人民气质和人民精神。”这些朋友们的称赞，有些是超过我们现有的水平的，对他们的鼓励和期许，中国艺术团的全体人员深深感谢。
    意大利公众热烈地希望中国艺术团延长演出期限或者能再次到意大利演出，遗憾的是艺术团不得不立即离开意大利来继续它的欧洲旅行。但是正如意大利艺术表演部的副部长所表示的，意大利和中国应该经常交换这样的剧团。我们也深信，通过文化关系加强东西方两大文化古国的人民之间的了解，澄清由于缺少接触而造成的不了解甚至误解，这必将大大有助于世界人类的和平事业。
