    YuMen Crude Oil Desalting and Dehydration Test Successful

    The problem of desalting and dehydrating YuMen crude oil has recently been successfully tested in a certain refinery.

    Solving the problem of desalting and dehydrating YuMen crude oil is one of the important issues in China's petroleum industry. Because salt water is distributed in the crude oil as extremely fine water droplets, and the water droplets are covered with a layer of oil film, it is difficult to separate the oil and water. During the refining process, the water vaporizes in the furnace tubes, the pressure in the furnace tubes suddenly increases, and the amount of crude oil refined has to be reduced significantly. At the same time, when the salt water in the crude oil is heated in the furnace, salt particles will form on the tube walls, quickly blocking the furnace tubes. Moreover, magnesium chloride in the salt decomposes into hydrogen chloride when heated, which seriously corrodes the equipment. Due to these reasons, the completion of the oil refining production increase plan is affected, and the time for shutdown and maintenance is increased. According to the characteristics of YuMen crude oil, the staff of a certain refinery carried out more than 400 small-scale desalting and dehydration tests. The results showed that adding cotton seed oil foots mixed with caustic soda to make a soap solution and mixing it into the crude oil could achieve a desalting and dehydration efficiency of more than 95%.

    Now, this refinery has built a new set of desalting and dehydration equipment and officially put it into production. (Shang Chongli)

    玉门原油脱盐脱水试验成功
    玉门原油脱盐脱水问题最近已在某炼油厂试验成功。
    解决玉门原油脱盐脱水问题，是我国石油工业中的重要问题之一。因为盐水分布在原油中成为极细微的水珠，水珠外面包有一层油膜，所以油水很难分开。在炼制过程中，水在炉管中汽化，炉管压力突然增大，原油炼量就要降低很多。同时原油中的盐水在炉中加热的时候，盐粒就结在管壁上，很快将炉管堵死，而且盐类中的氯化镁遇热分解变成氯化氢以后，严重地腐蚀设备。由于这些原因，就影响了炼油增产计划的完成和增加了停炉检修的时间。某炼油厂职工根据玉门原油的特点，进行了四百多次脱盐脱水的小型试验，结果证明把棉籽油脚加火碱制成肥皂溶液，混合在原油内，能够使原油有百分之九十五以上的脱盐脱水效率。
    现在，这个炼油厂已经新建了一套脱盐脱水的设备，正式投入了生产。　（尚崇礼）
