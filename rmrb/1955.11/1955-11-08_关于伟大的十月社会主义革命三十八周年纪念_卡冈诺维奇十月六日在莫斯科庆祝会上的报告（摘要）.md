Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, November 6th: TASS reported from Moscow on November 6th that Kaganovich, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered a report on the thirty-eighth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution at the celebration meeting held at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.

Kaganovich said: We can say without exaggeration that in world history, there has never been an event more significant to the fate of mankind than the October Revolution. In the thirty-eight years of Soviet power, our motherland has transformed from an economically backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial-collective farm socialist country, a country with advanced science and culture. Our motherland has become a beacon and hope for people all over the world.

National electrification is the most important link in Lenin's plan for building communism. Previously, our country was one of the most backward countries in terms of electricity production. Today, it ranks second in the world. During the Fifth Five-Year Plan, electricity production increased by 84 percent. During the era of Soviet power, more than three hundred large and medium-sized power stations have been built and put into production, including ninety hydroelectric power stations.

The electricity generation of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station alone reaches 11.4 billion kilowatt-hours, which is six times the national electricity generation of pre-revolutionary Russia in 1913. The first batch of turbines at the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will begin generating electricity by the end of this year, 1955.

We will continue to carry out electrification on an even larger scale. In the next five years, the first part of the world's largest Bratsk Hydroelectric Station on the Angara River will be completed and put into production.

Kaganovich cited historical facts to refute the shortsighted individuals in capitalist countries who did not understand the reality of Lenin's great plan. He said: All of this should be something for those who today despise the Chinese people and their government's efforts to industrialize and electrify their entire country to ponder.

Kaganovich pointed out: What was produced in the entire year of 1920 can now be produced in just a few days in 1955: electricity - one day, pig iron - one and a half days, coal - eighty days, oil - twenty days, sugar - seven days.

Lenin's plan for building communism has become the fighting program of our party and the Soviet people, and it is being victoriously implemented. The Soviet people are greeting the thirty-eighth anniversary of the October Revolution by completing the Fifth Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule.

The level of industrial production in 1955 increased to 184 percent of that in 1950, and 318 percent of that in 1940; the production of means of production increased to 189 percent of that in 1950; the production of consumer goods increased to 176 percent of that in 1950.

However, when summing up our achievements, we should remember Lenin's instruction: "The best way to celebrate the anniversary of a great revolution is to focus attention on the unfinished tasks of the revolution." The Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union have put forward these unfinished tasks to us in many resolutions.

Our industry, especially heavy industry, has gloriously fulfilled its mission in the past and is still doing so now. We have fostered it as a beloved child, as the foundation of communism, our country's defense, and independence.

However, the existing achievements cannot satisfy us. Our country is vast, and demands are constantly increasing. We are still economically behind the major capitalist countries. Therefore, we cannot be complacent.

The current task is to ensure the victorious elimination of shortcomings based on the resolutions of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee.

Since the October Revolution created new socialist relations of production, the main problem in the advancement of our country's economy is to ensure technological progress and better organization of production and labor.

To fall behind in this era of vigorous development of science and technology means to fall behind in the economic competition with capitalism. Only by rapidly and extensively adopting the latest achievements in science and technology at home and abroad can we achieve the higher labor productivity than capitalism that is necessary for the victory of communism.

Compared with 1940, our labor productivity in industry has increased two-fold in 1955, and 44 percent compared with 1950, but we have not exhausted all the potential for increasing labor productivity. In addition to adopting new technologies, it is also necessary to improve labor organization and improve the organization of socialist competition.

Our transportation industry has developed greatly in the years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan and is completing the plan. In 1955, the volume of freight transported by railways will increase by 60 percent compared with 1950.

Our socialist agriculture is greeting the thirty-eighth anniversary of the October Revolution with new victories. Collective farmers are working hard to complete the tasks assigned to them by the Communist Party.

The sown area in the Soviet Union has expanded by 27 percent compared with 1950, including more than 30 million hectares of virgin land that have been reclaimed.

Compared with 1954, the sown area of corn has increased more than four times. Animal husbandry is developing. This year, 1955, although the climatic conditions are not good (especially in Kazakhstan), the total national corn harvest is higher than last year. As of November 1, the amount of grain purchased was 129 million poods more than in 1954.

However, we are not satisfied with the achievements we have made and must make every effort to eliminate the existing shortcomings. It is necessary first of all to increase the yield per unit area of ​​grain and industrial raw material crops, ensure the development of animal husbandry, and improve the utilization of technology. Only in this way can we ensure that collective farmers live a prosperous life and ensure that the state's growing need for raw materials and grain is met.

In 1955, our party and government, as before, are concerned about meeting the material and cultural needs of the Soviet people. With the increase in residents' purchasing power and the reduction of prices, the domestic commodity circulation has also increased. The five-year plan for retail commodity circulation was completed in four years.

The real wages of industrial sector employees in 1955 were 39 percent higher than in 1950; 91 percent higher than in 1940; and the income of farmers (calculated on the average per worker) in 1955 was 50 percent higher than in 1950 and 122 percent higher than in 1940.

The state's allocations for social and cultural facilities - free education and scholarships, free medical care and convalescence, and paid vacation wages - have increased more than three and a half times compared with 1940. During this five-year plan, 150 million square meters of residential area have been completed and put into use.

We are now facing a new, Sixth Five-Year Plan. The state's task of leading the economy needs to be further expanded. Therefore, the work of state organs should be improved.

Kaganovich then pointed out that the results of the development of our country's national economy clearly demonstrate the great superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system. Compared with 1929, the industrial production index of the capitalist world in 1954 was 176. The industrial production index of the Soviet Union in 1954 was 1,785, which is about 18 times higher.

The average annual increase in industrial production in the Soviet Union during these years was more than five times the average annual increase in the capitalist world during the corresponding period. However, as everyone knows, of the thirty-eight years, our industrial production only rose in twenty years, because we had to devote ourselves to war and post-war reconstruction for eighteen years. We know that in terms of the total output of industrial products, we are now second only to the United States and rank second in the world. We are still behind the United States in many aspects, but we believe that according to our growth rate, as long as we eliminate the existing shortcomings, we will realize Lenin's instruction - to catch up with and surpass the United States in economic terms, that is, in terms of the quantity of products per capita.

The socialist economy of the Soviet Union develops in a planned and continuous manner, without crises or unemployment; the United States is rich, it has a strong industry, but the capitalist economy develops intermittently and often with crises.

Kaganovich pointed out that reality shows that no prescription can change the laws of capitalist development, or eliminate the increasingly acute contradictions inherent in capitalism, especially in its imperialist stage. Therefore, the most reactionary and arrogant imperialist groups attempt to find a "way out" on the path of escalating international tensions and military adventures. It is these groups that influenced in the past, and continue to influence to some extent, the policies of Western capitalist countries. As a result, the international situation between 1953 and 1954 was extremely tense and fraught with danger.

Kaganovich then elaborated on the successive measures taken by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries to ease international tensions. He pointed out that the various measures taken by the Soviet Union were not the usual purely diplomatic actions, but rather genuine and significant actions by the Soviet government, our Leninist party, and the Central Committee of the Party in the struggle for peace.

We have done and are doing everything in our power to promote peace, certainly not because of weakness, as imperialist propagandists would like to prove, but because we recognize our growing strength and power. We do not advise anyone to test our strength, especially those who have already tried it.

Today we can say that the forces of peace have grown. The power of the people of all countries is a decisive force. The people of all countries, including the people of the imperialist countries themselves, are unwilling to suffer and die for the interests of the militarists. It is precisely because of this that the wisest part of the bourgeoisie, feeling the increasingly strong resistance of the people of all countries to their policies, has brought about a certain degree of easing of international tensions.

If no significant steps to ease international tensions could be counted on the accounts of Western countries until recently, then today we can be satisfied to record on their accounts the effective and fruitful participation of the governments of the United States, Britain and France, together with the Soviet Union, in the summit conference of the four governments held in Geneva in July this year. Our Soviet delegation played a particularly outstanding role in Geneva, which was conducive to peace, and the Soviet delegation gloriously fulfilled the mission entrusted to it by our people.

The Geneva summit conference of the four governments was a major event in the entire international life. All those who support peace welcome this meeting. After the Geneva conference, the Soviet Union implemented the spirit of Geneva with actions, but the other participants in the Geneva conference not only did not take significant steps, but even deviated from the spirit of Geneva.

We have always believed that although the environment created after the Geneva conference is more conducive to the struggle for peace, this is not a period of peace and tranquility in which the enemies of peace cannot disrupt the peaceful life of the people of all countries.

World opinion is now watching the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The Soviet government believes that the issue of European collective security is an important issue for the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference.

The people of Europe have the right to firmly demand that some practical measures be taken to prevent new wars and ensure the security of European countries, especially those that suffered from Hitler's aggression. The Soviet proposal is also in line with this goal.

We advocate the reunification of Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. This is the firm and unshakable position of the Soviet government, and we will not budge on this point. We agree to discuss the two issues together, but connecting them does not mean subordinating the more important issue of European security to the German issue, as the representatives of the three Western countries strove for in Geneva.

The reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons are now one of the most pressing demands of the people of all countries in the struggle to consolidate peace.

We advocate establishing supervision over disarmament and establishing supervision over continued armaments. We cannot abandon the proposal to stop the arms race and prohibit atomic weapons. What the people of all countries expect is not verbal promises, but practical actions, not disarmament declarations, but genuine disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

After the Second World War, many countries in Asia and Africa gained independence for the first time. The Bandung Conference of twenty-nine Asian and African countries played a huge role in the struggle to consolidate universal peace. The Soviet Union and our party have always sympathized with the struggle of the people of these countries for freedom and independence, and have given and will continue to give them moral and political support.

We believe that the upcoming visit of Comrades N.A. Bulganin and N.S. Khrushchev to great India, Burma and Afghanistan will promote further strengthening of the friendship between the Soviet people and the people of India, Burma and Afghanistan, and the people of the East.

The experience of international relations in 1955 proves that the Soviet Union's policy of resolving international disputes through negotiations is entirely correct. (Applause)

Now there are all the conditions in the world to stop the "Cold War" and to establish lasting and consolidated peaceful relations. To achieve this goal, the reactionary forces of imperialism must be more rejected, and governments must guarantee peace to the people with actions.

The summary we made when celebrating the thirty-eighth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution shows that great achievements have been made in the struggle for peace and for the coexistence of the two systems. The peace movement is growing stronger. The unity of the people of all countries in the struggle for peace is constantly strengthening.

However, everyone who cherishes peace and the friendship of the people of all countries knows that it is impossible to be complacent. The struggle for peace requires vigilance, requires exposing aggressive policies, and requires strengthening the peace front.

The people of all countries and the working people of all countries can rest assured that the Soviet state created by the October Revolution was, is, and will continue to be a reliable pillar of peace, the friendship of the people of all countries, and fraternal unity.

The Soviet people are patriots who love their motherland, and have been, are, and will continue to be proletarian internationalists. Therefore, no one can undermine this close bond that links the Soviet people with the broad masses of the people and with the working class of all countries. Of course, this does not mean that our state, established by the October Revolution, interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.

Revolutionary ideas have no borders. It can travel around the world without a passport or fingerprint. If the 19th century was the century of capitalism, then the 20th century is the century of the victory of socialism and communism.

Kaganovich emphasized that the experience of our revolution proves that if the centuries-long struggle of the oppressed and exploited working people cannot achieve victory because there is no proletariat, then in the presence of the working class, victory is also impossible without a revolutionary communist party armed with advanced Marxist-Leninist theory and closely linked with the masses.

The strength of our party lies in its principles, in the fact that it always shares weal and woe with the workers and working people, the party teaches the working people and learns from the working people. It requires an iron will, an indestructible confidence in the righteousness of its cause based on scientific communism, and the greatest loyalty to the working class and all the people. Only in this way can we have traversed such a glorious and victorious path as our party has traversed in more than fifty years. The socialist motherland is full of self-esteem and pride, so it is understandable why all ordinary people love and respect our great Communist Party so much.

The Party is preparing to greet its Twentieth National Congress. The entire people are preparing to greet the Congress worthily. All parts of the Soviet Union are launching a nationwide socialist competition to greet the Party's Twentieth National Congress.

The people, the Party, and its Central Committee are convinced that the resolutions of the Twentieth National Congress will inspire and organize our people to strive for new and glorious victories of communism.

    关于伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念
    ——卡冈诺维奇十月六日在莫斯科庆祝会上的报告（摘要）
    新华社七日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会主席团委员、苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇十一月六日在莫斯科的大剧院举行的庆祝会上作了关于伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年纪念的报告。
    卡冈诺维奇说：我们可以毫不夸张地说，在世界历史上，从来没有过比十月革命对人类命运更重大的事件了。在苏维埃政权的三十八年中，我们的祖国已经从一个经济上落后的农业国家变成了一个强大的工业—集体农庄社会主义国家，一个具有先进的科学和文化的国家。我们的祖国已经成为全世界人民的灯塔和希望。
    国家电气化是列宁的建设共产主义的计划中最重要的环节。以前我们的国家是电力生产最落后的国家之一。今天，它已经在世界上占第二位。在第五个五年计划期间，电力生产增加百分之八十四。在苏维埃政权的年代中，有三百个以上的大型和中型电力站建立起来和投入生产，其中包括九十个水力发电站。
    单单古比雪夫水力发电站一个站的发电量就达到一百一十四亿度，那就是说，为革命前俄国在一九一三年的全国发电量的六倍。古比雪夫水电站的第一批涡轮将在今年即一九五五年年底前开始发电。
    我们将以更大的规模继续开展电气化工作。在今后五年期间，安加拉河上的全世界最大的布拉次克水电站的第一部分将要建成并且投入生产。
    卡冈诺维奇引述史实驳斥了当年资本主义国家某些见识短浅的人不了解列宁的伟大计划的现实性。他说：这一切，应该是值得那些今天蔑视中国人民和他们的政府为他们整个国家工业化和电气化而努力的人们深思的事情。
    卡冈诺维奇指出：一九二零年整年生产的东西在一九五五年只要若干天就生产出来了：电力——一天，生铁——一天半，煤——八十天，石油——二十天，糖——七天。
    建设共产主义的列宁计划成了我们党和苏联人民的战斗纲领，并且正在胜利地执行中。苏联人民以提前完成第五个五年计划来迎接十月革命三十八周年。
    一九五五年的工业生产水平增加为一九五零年的百分之一百八十四，而为一九四零年的百分之三百一十八；生产资料的生产量增为一九五零年的百分之一百八十九；消费品生产量增为一九五零年的百分之一百七十六。
    不过我们在总结成就的时候应该记住列宁的这一遗训：“庆祝伟大革命周年的最好方法，就是把注意力集中在尚未完成的革命任务上。”党中央委员会和苏联部长会议在许多决议中就向我们提出了这些尚未完成的任务。
    我们的工业特别是重工业，过去和现在都一直光荣地完成着自己的使命，我们曾把它作为一个亲爱的婴儿，作为共产主义、我国的国防和独立的基础的基础而加以扶植。
    但是，现有的成就不能使我们满足。我们的国家是巨大的，需求总是不断增加，我们在经济上仍然落后于主要的资本主义国家。因此我们不能骄傲自满。
    目前的任务是，保证根据党中央七月全会的决议胜利地消除缺点。
    自从十月革命创造了新的社会主义生产关系以后，我国经济向前推进的主要问题就是保证技术进步和更好地组织生产和劳动。
    在目前科学和技术蓬勃发展的时代中落后，就意味着在同资本主义进行的经济竞赛中落后。只有迅速和广泛地采用祖国和世界的科学技术上的最新成就，我们才能取得为共产主义胜利所必需的、比资本主义高的劳动生产率。
    一九五五年同一九四零年相比，我们在工业方面的劳动生产率已经提高为两倍，同一九五零年相比提高了百分之四十四，但是我们并没有用尽提高劳动生产率的全部潜力。除了采用新技术外，还必须改善劳动组织，改善在进一步展开社会主义竞赛方面的组织工作。
    我们的运输业在第五个五年计划的几年中大大地发展了，并且正在完成着计划。一九五五年铁道运输的货运量要比一九五零年增加百分之六十。
    我们的社会主义农业以新的胜利迎接十月革命三十八周年。集体农民正在努力完成共产党交给他们的任务。
    苏联的播种面积比一九五零年扩大了百分之二十七，其中包括开垦了的三千多万公顷的荒地。
    同一九五四年相比，玉蜀黍的播种面积已经增加为四倍以上。畜牧业正在发展。在今年，一九五五年，虽然气候条件不好（特别是在哈萨克），全国的玉蜀黍总收获量要比去年为高，到十一月一日为止征购的粮食量比一九五四年多一亿二千九百万普特。
    但是，我们并没有满足于已有的成就，必须尽
  一切努力来消除现有的缺点。必须首先提高谷物和工业原料作物的单位面积产量，保证发展畜牧业并且改进技术的利用情况。这样才能保证集体农民过富裕的生活，保证供应国家对原料和粮食日益增长的需要。
    在一九五五年，我们党和政府像从前一样关怀满足苏联人民的物质和文化需要。随着居民购买力的增长和价格的降低，国内的商品流转也增加了。零售商品流转方面的五年计划四年就完成了。
    工业部门职工的实际工资一九五五年比一九五零年高百分之三十九；比一九四零年高百分之九十一；而农民的收入（按照一个劳动者平均计算），在一九五五年比一九五零年高百分之五十，比一九四零年高了百分之一百二十二。
    国家对社会和文化设施——免费教育和助学金、免费医疗和疗养、休假工资照付——的拨款同一九四零年相比增为三倍半以上。在这个五年计划期间，有一亿五千万平方公尺的住宅面积已经落成和使用。
    我们现在面临着新的、第六个五年计划。国家领导经济的任务要更加扩大了。因此，国家机关的工作应当改进。
    卡冈诺维奇接着指出：我国国民经济发展的结果，明显地证明了社会主义制度对资本主义制度的巨大优越性。同一九二九年相比，资本主义世界的工业生产指数在一九五四年为一百七十六。而苏联的工业生产指数，在一九五四年为一千七百八十五，即约增为十八倍。
    苏联的工业生产在这些年代中平均每年增加的速度，为资本主义世界在这相应的时期内每年平均增加速度的五倍以上。然而大家知道，在三十八年当中，我们工业生产的上升只是在二十年里面进行的，因为有十八年的时间我们不得不投身于战争和从事战后的恢复工作。我们知道，在工业品的总产量上，我们现在还次于美国而占世界第二位，我们在很多方面还落后于美国，但是我们相信，按照我们的增长速度，只要我们消除现有的缺点，我们将会实现列宁的遗训——在经济方面，也就是在按人口计算的产品数量方面赶上美国并且超过美国。
    苏联的社会主义经济有计划地、不间断地发展着，没有危机，没有失业；美国是富有的，它有强大的工业，但是资本主义经济是在断断续续、常常有危机的情况下发展着的。
    卡冈诺维奇指出：现实生活表明，没有任何药方能够改变资本主义发展的法则，能够消除资本主义所固有的，特别是在它的帝国主义阶段所固有的越来越尖锐的矛盾。因此，最反动和最狂妄的帝国主义集团企图在国际局势尖锐化和军事冒险的道路上寻找“出路”。正是这些集团在过去影响了、并且，现在继续在某种程度上影响着西方资本主义国家的政策。其结果是在一九五三到一九五四年间国际局势极端紧张而且包藏着危险。
    卡冈诺维奇接着详述了苏联和各人民民主国家为缓和国际紧张局势而采取的接二连三的措施。他指出，苏联的各种措施不是通常的单纯外交性质的行动，而是苏联政府、我们的列宁的党和党中央委员会在争取和平的斗争中的真正重大的行动。
    我们过去和现在竭尽一切力量来促进和平，当然，这绝不是如同帝国主义宣传家所想证明的那样是由于软弱，而是认识到自己的日益增长的力量和实力。我们不劝告任何人来试试我们的力量，特别是那些已经试过我们力量的人。
    今天我们可以说，和平的力量增长了。各国人民的力量是一种决定性的力量，各国人民，其中包括帝国主义国家自己的人民在内，都不愿为了军国主义者的利益而去受难送死。正是因为这样，资产阶级最明智的一部分人由于感到他们的政策引起各国人民越来越强大的反抗，使国际紧张局势得到一定程度的缓和。
    如果说在最近时期以前没有任何缓和国际紧张局势的重大步骤可以算在西方国家的账上的话，那末今天我们可以满意地把美国、英国和法国三国政府同苏联一起有效地、富有成果地参加今年七月在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议这件事记在它们的账上了。我们苏联代表团在日内瓦会议上起了特别有利于和平的卓越作用，苏联代表团光荣地完成了我国人民的委托。
    四国政府首脑日内瓦会议是整个国际生活中的一个重大的事件。所有拥护和平的人都欢迎这次会议。在日内瓦会议以后苏联用行动实现了日内瓦精神，但是日内瓦会议的其他参加者不但没有采取重大的步骤，反而甚至背离了日内瓦精神。
    我们过去和现在一直认为，虽然在日内瓦会议以后创造了更有利于和平斗争的环境，但是这并不是一个平安无事的、和平的敌人不能够破坏各国人民的和平生活的时期。
    现在世界舆论注视着日内瓦四国外长会议。苏联政府认为欧洲集体安全问题是日内瓦四国外长会议的一个重要的问题。
    欧洲人民有权坚决要求，总要采取一些实际的措施以防止新战争，保障欧洲各国，首先是遭受希特勒侵略灾祸的国家的安全。苏联的建议也符合这个目标。
    我们主张把德国重新统一成为爱好和平和民主的国家。这是苏联政府的坚定不移的立场，在这点上我们是丝毫不会让步的。我们同意把两个问题联系起来讨论，但是联系起来并不是说像西方三国代表在日内瓦力争的那样，把更加重大的关于欧洲安全的问题从属于德国问题。
    裁减军备和禁止原子武器，现在是各国人民在争取巩固和平的斗争中的最迫切的要求之一。
    我们主张对裁军建立监督，主张对继续武装建立监督。我们不能放弃关于停止扩充军备和禁止原子武器的建议。各国人民期待的不是口头诺言，而是实际行动，不是裁军宣言，而是真正的裁军和禁止原子武器。
    在第二次世界大战之后，亚洲和非洲的许多国家第一次获得了独立。亚非二十九个国家的万隆会议对争取巩固普遍和平的斗争，起了巨大的作用。苏联和我们的党一向同情这些国家的人民争取自由和独立的斗争，过去和将来都给予他们以道义和政治上的支持。
    我们相信：尼·亚·布尔加宁同志和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的即将访问伟大的印度、缅甸和阿富汗，将会促使苏联人民同印度、缅甸、阿富汗三国人民，同东方人民之间的友谊得到进一步的加强。
    一九五五年国际关系发展的经验证明，苏联主张通过谈判来解决国际分歧的方针是完全正确的。（掌声）
    现在世界上已经具备一切条件来停止“冷战”，来确立持久的巩固的和平的关系。为了达到这个目的，必须使帝国主义反动势力受到更大的排斥，使各国政府用行动保证给人民以和平。
    我们在庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年的时候所作的总结，说明了在争取和平和争取两种制度共处的斗争中得到了重大的成就。和平运动日益壮大。各国人民在争取和平斗争中的团结不断加强。
    但是，一切珍视和平和各国人民友好的人都知道，陶醉是不行的，争取和平的斗争需要警惕，需要揭露侵略政策，需要加强和平阵线。
    各国人民和各国的劳动人民可以相信，由十月革命所创造的苏维埃国家，过去是，现在仍是和平、世界各国人民友好和兄弟团结的可靠支柱。
    苏联人是热爱自己祖国的爱国者，而且过去、现在和将来都是无产阶级的国际主义者。所以，不论是谁，决不可能破坏这种把苏联人民同广大人民群众、同世界各国的工人阶级联系在一起的紧密结合。当然，这并不意味着我们这个由十月革命建立起来的国家干涉其他国家的内政。
    革命思想是没有国界的，它可以不要护照也不要捺指印而旅行全世界。如果十九世纪是资本主义的世纪，那末，二十世纪就是社会主义和共产主义胜利的世纪。
    卡冈诺维奇强调指出：我们革命的经验证明了，如果说，被压迫的和被剥削的劳动人民的许多世纪的斗争因为没有无产阶级而不能取得胜利，那末，在有了工人阶级的情况下，如果没有革命的、用先进的马克思列宁主义理论武装起来的、同群众有密切联系的共产党，胜利也是不可能的。
    我们党的力量就在于它的原则性，在于：它永远同工人、同劳动人民同甘共苦，党教导劳动人民并向劳动人民学习。需要有钢铁的意志，对自己事业的正义性有不可摧毁的以科学共产主义为基础的信心，对工人阶级和全体人民有最大的忠诚。才能在五十多年中走过像我们党所走过的这样一条光荣的胜利的道路。社会主义祖国充满自尊感和自豪感，那末，就可以理解为什么所有的普通人都这么热爱和尊敬我们伟大的共产党了。
    党在准备迎接自己的第二十次代表大会。全体人民在准备无愧地迎接代表大会。苏联各地在展开全民的社会主义竞赛来迎接党的第二十次代表大会。
    人民、党和它的中央委员会深信，第二十次代表大会的决议将鼓舞和组织我国人民争取新的、光荣的共产主义的胜利。
