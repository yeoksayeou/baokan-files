Warmly Welcome the Korean Youth Art Troupe

The Korean Youth Art Troupe gave its premiere performance on the evening of the 18th at the Tianqiao Theater in Beijing, presenting the five-act opera "Kongjwi and Patjwi." "Kongjwi and Patjwi" is based on a popular Korean folktale, written by Zhao Lingchu and composed by Li Mianxiang. The opera depicts the hardworking and kind Kongjwi being mistreated by her stepmother and stepsister Patjwi, but with the support of righteous forces, she finally finds happiness, while those who abused Kongjwi are despised by the people. On the evening of the 19th, the Korean Youth Art Troupe performed many more wonderful song and dance programs to entertain the families of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army martyrs, military families, and returned volunteers. Each program was warmly welcomed by the audience.
