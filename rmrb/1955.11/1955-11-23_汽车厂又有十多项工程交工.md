Following the acceptance of the first batch of over twenty individual projects, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has recently completed and handed over more than ten additional projects, including three factory buildings, two power stations, and various power pipelines and sewage systems.

　　The quality of the factory buildings in the seven workshops and the five power station projects that have been handed over for acceptance has been rated as excellent or good. The forging workshop, constructed entirely of steel and equipped with a large number of heavy forging and pressing equipment, the general assembly workshop connecting all production workshops in the factory, and the No. 2 air compressor station have been rated as excellent quality.

　　All metal structures and reinforced concrete structures of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant are designed according to Soviet standards, with components prefabricated by processing plants or on-site, and then assembled. Because the technical supervision system has been strictly implemented during construction, and each process has undergone self-inspection by the construction unit and re-inspection by the acceptance unit, the quality of all major construction projects in the factory has been ensured.

　  汽车厂又有十多项工程交工
    第一汽车制造厂继第一批二十多项单位工程交工验收以后，最近又有三个厂房、两个动力站，以及各种动力管道、上下水道等十多项工程陆续交工。
      已交工验收的有七个工场的厂房和五个动力站工程的质量，都被评定为优或良。完全用钢结构组成的并已安装了大量重型锻压设备的锻工场、连接全厂各个生产车间的总装配工场，以及二号空气压缩站等厂房，被评定为优等质量。
    第一汽车制造厂的全部金属结构和钢筋混凝土结构，都是按照苏联标准设计，先由加工厂或就地预制成构件，然后实行装配式施工的。由于在施工中严格地贯彻技术监督制度，各个工序都经过施工单位自检和验收单位复检，因而保证了全厂各项主要建筑工程的质量。（新华社）
