Fujian Province held its first People's Police and Public Security Protection Committee Member Model Hero Representative Conference from November 20th to 25th. The conference exchanged experiences in the struggle against the enemy and elected representatives to attend the National People's Police Public Security Hero Model Representative Conference.

In supporting the liberation of Taiwan, consolidating coastal defense, and maintaining urban and rural public security, the people of Fujian have produced a large number of activists, model public security protection committee members, and people's police. More than 8,000 heroes and models participated in the recent people's police and public security committee model hero conferences held in 70 counties and cities throughout the province. Kang Muju, director of the Public Security Protection Committee of Qiannei Township, Hui'an County, which faces the bandit Chiang-occupied Wuqiu Island, has relied on the masses over the years to assist public security organs in cracking two US-Chiang Kai-shek spy cases and, together with the people of the township, seized more than 100 firearms hidden by counter-revolutionaries. He also went to enemy-occupied islands several times to distribute propaganda materials, risking danger to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in sweeping away the mines placed by the Chiang bandits in the fishing grounds, protecting fishermen's safe voyages to sea for fishing, and was therefore rated as a county-level first-class public security model. Wu Yihui, a traffic policeman and anti-bombing model in Fuzhou City, disregarded danger and rescued four people from the raging fire during the enemy bombing of Fuzhou on January 20 this year. Lin Dongqin, a first-class public security model in Haicheng County, actively participated in the security work of the agricultural production cooperative. During the rectification of the cooperative this year, he mobilized the masses to identify and clear out eight bad elements who had infiltrated the cooperative.

At the conference, the hero models stated that they would continue to rely on the masses, strengthen the struggle against the enemy along the coast, defend the agricultural cooperation movement, and strengthen the security work of organs, factories, and schools.
