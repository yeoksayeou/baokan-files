　　"Allies'" Grievances
　　At the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France claimed to speak on behalf of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, which, according to them, was the "only one qualified to represent the German people."
　　But even the West German government is not satisfied with these self-appointed representatives.
　　According to "New York Times" reporter Heider, "In public, the West German government expressed satisfaction with the plan on the German question submitted by the Western three foreign ministers to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. On the day the plan was presented, the Bonn government even hailed it as a truly remarkable masterpiece. However, the private opinions of West German officials do not contain such public views." Because "the fact is that although West German experts participated in the Western working group that formulated the plan, when West German Foreign Minister Brentano went to New York to meet with the Western three foreign ministers, the three foreign ministers had already completed their plan and agreed on the final position. Brentano was invited to express his views and agree to the Western plan."
　　Heider said, "West Germany had to express its agreement, although some of their main opinions were not incorporated into this document." West Germany believes that these opinions "would make this final plan negotiable," while the Western plan is "non-negotiable." And to use a clearly unworkable plan for a unified Germany to deceive the West German people who demand unification is obviously impossible to succeed.
　　During the Foreign Ministers Conference, on the surface, the West German government had "observers" stationed in Geneva who frequently contacted the Western three foreign ministers, as if the opinions of the West German government were respected and considered. But in reality, this West German "observer" only played a minor role in the Western countries' performance. Heider wrote: "Almost every day, the Western three foreign ministers did not consult with the Bonn government's observers before taking a position directly related to the future of Germany, and only told them after it was publicly announced." And the way they did it was that the West German observers "sat and waited for the Western delegations to 'briefly describe' what happened during the day's meeting. And the situation that these Western countries briefly told the West German delegation was something that any reporter could get by attending the daily press conferences held by the delegations of various countries." According to him, some reporters were more informed than the West German delegation who listened to the Western officials' one-hour report.
　　Therefore, according to Heider, the West German officials in Geneva felt that they were just "second-class" allies of the West, although they paid a "huge price, including the permanent division of Germany," to participate in the North Atlantic Group.
　　But, since they are willing to link their fate with the military bloc policy of the United States, such grievances are superfluous. (Sheng)

### “盟国”的牢骚

　　“盟国”的牢骚
    在四国外长会议上，美、英、法三国外长自称代表德意志联邦共和国政府说话，而德意志联邦共和国政府据他们说又是“唯一有资格作为德国人民代表的”。
    但是甚至西德政府也对于这些自封的代表并不满意。
    据“纽约时报”记者海德尔报道：“在公开场合，西德政府对于西方三国外长提交给苏联外长莫洛托夫的关于德国问题的计划表示满意。在提出这个计划那一天，波恩政府还把这个计划欢呼为一件真正了不起的杰作。西德官员私下的意见里却并不含有这种公开的看法。”因为“事实是西德专家虽然参加了制定计划的西方工作组，然而当西德外长勃伦塔诺到纽约与西方三国外长见面时，三国外长已经完成他们的计划并同意了最后的立场。勃伦塔诺是被请去发表他的观点并且同意西方的计划的。”
    海德尔说，“西德只好表示同意，虽然他们的某些主要意见没有被纳入这个文件。”西德认为，这些意见是“会使得这个最后计划成为可以谈判的”，西方的计划却是“没有谈判余地的”。而要拿一个明显地行不通的统一德国的计划来欺骗要求统一的西德人民，显然是不可能成功的。
    在外长会议期间，表面上西德政府在日内瓦派有“观察员”经常同西方三国外长接触，好像西德政府的意见是受到尊重和考虑的。但是实际上这个西德的“观察员”只是在西方国家的演出里担任跑龙套的脚色。海德尔写道：“几乎每天，西方三外长在采取直接有关德国前途的立场之前，是不跟波恩政府的观察员商量的，而且只是在公开发表了之后才告诉他们。”而所采取的方式是西德观察员们“坐着等西方代表团来‘简要叙述’一天会议进程中所发生的事。而这些西方国家简略告诉西德代表团的情况是任何一个记者在参加各国代表团所举行的每日记者会议上都可以得到的。”据他说，有些记者要比西德代表团听西方官员的一个钟点的报告还来得完全。
    因此，据海德尔说，在日内瓦的西德官员们觉得他们不过是“西方的‘二等’盟友”，虽然他们付出了“包括永远分裂德国”在内的“巨大代价”来参加北大西洋集团。
    但是，既然甘心把自己的命运同美国的军事集团政策联系在一起，这种牢骚也就是多余的了。（生）
