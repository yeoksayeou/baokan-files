　　Shanghai's Private Cigarette Industry Implements Industry-Wide Public-Private Partnership
　　Jie Xiao

　　In October of this year, all sixteen private cigarette factories in Shanghai implemented public-private partnerships. From then on, the private factories in Shanghai's cigarette industry were all brought into the orbit of state capitalism.

　　These sixteen factories had a total of 9,603 employees and 72 capitalists. Their total output value in 1954 was 114.8 million yuan, accounting for 41% of Shanghai's total cigarette output value. This time, apart from five factories that were individually converted into joint state-private enterprises, eleven factories were merged into three larger factories. The sizes of these eleven factories varied greatly. Huamei Cigarette Factory was a relatively large factory with 1,473 people and 20 cigarette machines; Youli Cigarette Factory had only 48 people and one machine. The quality of technical equipment also varied greatly from factory to factory. Some factories' machines were old and incomplete, operating semi-manually. For example, Ruilun Cigarette Factory had six cigarette machines, of which three had incomplete parts, and the other three had been in use for more than 30 years, exceeding their service life. Some factories didn't even have radiators; they used fire to dry the tobacco leaves, lacking steam-drying equipment, resulting in a lot of broken tobacco shreds. Some factories had very small or dilapidated buildings. Some were illegal constructions, others were in lane houses, with mezzanines built on top of mezzanines, and several machines squeezed into a small room. Workers would accidentally bump into the machines and get injured when they turned around. Some factories didn't even have windows, and they had to turn on the lights during the day to work. In summer, the workers felt like they were trapped in a box. The walls of some factories were already leaning, and people felt the building moving when they walked upstairs. Moreover, the boiler and the workshop were connected together, so if the boiler had a problem, the lives of all the workers in the factory would be in danger.

　　Because of the poor equipment, there was a lot of waste in production, and the quality was also very poor. For example, some factories did not have steam leaf machines, so they had to pile the tobacco leaves to be steamed in a small room and let the steam in, but the room was leaky, making it difficult to steam them to the right level of dryness. Sometimes they were steamed too wet, and the tobacco leaves would become moldy; if they were steamed too dry, the tobacco leaves would become brittle and easily break. Because the machines were old and incomplete, the cigarettes produced also did not meet the standards, often being too long or too short, too thick or too thin, too light or too heavy. In some factories, the leaf-tearing workshop was open on all sides, and broken leaves were blown all over the ground. Yuhua Cigarette Factory used as much as 28 kilograms of coal per case of cigarettes because of the poor furnace (while general factories only use about 10 kilograms per case).

　　Some factories not only had poor equipment but also lacked working capital, relying on borrowing to survive. Because Jinlei Cigarette Factory didn't have money, they never added new parts when the parts on the machines broke, only going to the used goods stalls to get some old parts. Sometimes the parts they got were too small, so they would file down the machine a bit to install them. However, some large factories had ample funds, some even having too much capital that they couldn't use and had to deposit it in the bank. These factories had complete equipment, with new machines and new and spacious factory buildings. For example, Huamei Cigarette Factory also had new machines sitting idle, and the factory buildings and equipment could originally be used by more than 1,000 people working day and night shifts, but now even one shift was not fully utilized. Only one-third of the factory buildings of Dadong Cigarette Factory were used. Because the equipment was not fully utilized, it also caused waste in production. More than 300 people were producing using a large furnace that could be used by more than 1,000 people.

　　From the above, it can be seen that some factories were not in a position to independently convert into joint state-private enterprises, and it was even difficult for them to continue production. Therefore, the method of large factories leading small factories was adopted to implement mergers and joint operations. In this way, factories could learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, eliminate the dross, and utilize the surplus funds and idle good equipment to play a greater role. Without spending money to add anything, three large joint state-private cigarette factories with relatively complete equipment could be established.

　　On August 11th, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee announced the approval of the joint state-private factories. The eleven cigarette factories preparing to merge and jointly operate immediately began to prepare for the work of asset inventory and valuation. At this time, the capitalists were most worried about suffering losses. The public representatives explained the principle of "fair and reasonable, seeking truth from facts" in the inventory and valuation to the capitalists. The capitalists said they believed in the state's policies, but they still had doubts in their hearts. Some capitalists tested the waters when talking to the public representatives, and when they couldn't find out anything, they went to the workers to test the waters. Some capitalists even deliberately estimated the price of the machines lower, or said that good machines were bad machines, to see if the public representatives were really seeking truth from facts. Only when they saw with their own eyes that the public representatives and workers were doing a fair and reasonable job in inventory and valuation, and that they consulted with them to solve problems, did the capitalists' original fear of suffering losses slowly disappear. The public representatives, on the one hand, based on the principle of fairness and reasonableness, seeking truth from facts, estimated the price of each item according to its value. If the capitalists estimated it too high, they would bring it up with them and consult with them to solve it; if the capitalists deliberately underestimated it, they would also point out that it was underestimated and price it according to its actual value. On the other hand, they relied on workers and staff to explain the truth to the capitalists. For example, Guohua Cigarette Factory had a cigarette machine that could only be used for another five years, but the capitalist wanted to estimate it for eight to ten years. So the public representatives mobilized the workers, disassembled the machine, and pointed out the problems on the machine parts one by one to the capitalist. With the facts in front of him, the capitalist was convinced. The capitalist of Jinlei Cigarette Factory estimated the price of everything particularly high, and the other capitalists had opinions, but they also wanted to estimate their own things higher, so they kept their opinions to themselves. The public representatives organized a group of workers and technicians in the five factories to be merged to form an evaluation team to uniformly evaluate the machines of the five factories. As a result, the capitalists automatically reduced their originally overestimated figures.

　　The public representatives also handled the contradictions between the capitalists in the processing of asset inventory and valuation based on the principles of fairness and reasonableness, seeking truth from facts. For example, Dayunlong Cigarette Factory had a cigarette machine that could actually be considered a bad machine, but the capitalist wanted to count it as a good machine. The capitalists of other factories also felt that it should not be counted as a good machine. So the public representatives invited the capitalists of other factories to evaluate it. Capitalist Chen Jiqun said, "To be honest, this machine is not good to use." The capitalist of Dayunlong had nothing to say.

　　On the issue of personnel arrangements, because the situations of the capitalists were different, there were various concerns at the beginning. Those capitalists of large factories or those who had some status in the industry were not worried about their future work and were very active, but they often looked down on small and medium-sized capitalists. Some capitalists of small factories were worried that their status would be lower and their income would be reduced after the merger. Some capitalists who were old or uneducated and had poor work ability were afraid that they would not have work to do or income after the merger. Capitalists of "inverted" (liabilities exceeding assets) factories secretly rejoiced at the opportunity to get rid of the mess, but they were also worried that they would not be given a position.

　　In response to these thoughts, the public representatives explained to the capitalists that our principle of personnel arrangement is to employ people according to their abilities. As long as they are law-abiding capitalists, they can all have positions and powers, but they must fulfill their responsibilities. In dealing with this issue, based on the principle of employing people according to their abilities, they repeatedly consulted with the capitalists. For example, Wang Weilin, the capitalist of Ruilun Cigarette Factory, was illiterate and had poor work ability, but he had some production technology. The factory planned to make him a technical consultant, but he himself proposed to be the deputy director. So the public representatives explained to him that the deputy director after the joint state-private operation was different from the deputy director in the private sector. In the future, when dividing work, the deputy director would have to stand alone, planning, arranging work, and inspecting, summarizing, and reporting work. If he couldn't do the work, it would be detrimental to the factory and himself. At the same time, they also explained to him that the status of a technical consultant was not low, and the work was also very valuable. Wang Weilin felt that he really couldn't be the deputy director in the future, and that it would not be easy to handle, so he agreed to be a technical consultant.

　　After Shanghai's private cigarette factories adopted the method of "large factories leading small factories" to implement joint state-private operations, many benefits can already be seen. Many small factories in the past were in a serious situation of poor product quality and high costs for a long time due to poor equipment and backward management. After merging into large factories, the problems caused by technical equipment were solved by utilizing the advanced equipment of the large factories. For example, Yuhua Cigarette Factory used to use more than 28 kilograms of coal per case of cigarettes because of the poor boiler. Now, using the good boiler of Huamei Cigarette Factory, it only uses more than 7 kilograms of coal per case. Some small factories that merged into Dadong Cigarette Factory originally had short and small cylinders on their silk-drying machines, and the tobacco silk was squeezed into the cylinders and could not be stirred evenly. As a result, some tobacco silk was baked, while some was still wet. Now, using the silk-drying machine of Dadong Cigarette Factory, the cylinders on the machine are large and long, and the tobacco silk is stirred evenly inside. The dried tobacco silk is just right in dryness and wetness, and it will not be baked. The specialized company stipulates that each case of cigarettes uses 107 kilograms of tobacco leaves. But before the merger, some small factories always used 110 kilograms, or even 112 kilograms. Now the merged factories have been able to meet the standards set by the specialized company, and the quality of the cigarettes is also higher than in the past. Huamei Cigarette Factory, which was merged, can save more than 17,000 kilograms of tobacco leaves in one month. The technical expertise of the workers has also been given the opportunity to be brought into full play, overcoming the waste of labor. Originally, Yuhua Cigarette Factory had a worker who could repair machines quickly and well, but because there were few machines in the factory, he didn't have much to do all day. Now, he is full of energy in his work. These small factories that merged into large factories used to have very few welfare facilities. Now they use the original welfare facilities of the large factories, and their working conditions and material lives have also been improved. For example, some small factories used to have no heating equipment, and the northwest wind drilled into the packaging workshop from the cracks in the walls, making the workers' fingers stiff with cold. After merging into a large factory, walking into the packaging workshop is as warm as spring.

　　上海私营卷烟工业实行了全行业公私合营
　　解宵
    今年十月，上海市十六家私营卷烟厂都实行了公私合营。从此，上海市卷烟业中的私营厂都纳入了国家资本主义的轨道。
    这十六家厂，共有职工九千六百零三人，资本家七十二人。一九五四年的总产值是一亿一千四百八十万元，占上海卷烟总产值的百分之四十一。这次除了五个厂是单独合营的以外，有十一个厂是合并合营的，共合并合营成三个大厂。这十一个厂规模的大小很悬殊，华美烟厂是一个规模较大的厂，有一千四百七十三人，光卷烟车就有二十部；友利烟厂只有四十八人，一部机器。技术设备的好坏，各厂相差也很远。有些厂的机器又旧又不齐全，是半手工操作的。例如瑞伦烟厂有六部卷烟机，其中三部机件残缺不全，另外三部已用了三十多年，超过了使用年限。有的厂连水汀都没有，烘烟丝用火烘，没有蒸气烘的设备，因此，碎断的烟丝多。有些厂的厂房很小或很破旧。有的是违章建筑，有的是弄堂房子，搁楼上搭搁楼，几部机器挤在一间小房子里，工人转动时，稍不小心，就会碰上机器轧伤。有些厂连窗子都没有，白天也开着电灯工作。夏天，工人像闷在箱子里一样。有的厂墙壁已经歪斜，人在楼上走，就觉得房子在动。而且锅炉和车间联在一起，一旦锅炉发生毛病，全厂工人的生命都有危险。
    因为设备差，在生产上造成的浪费很大，质量也很差。例如有些厂没有蒸叶机，只好把要蒸的烟叶堆在一间小房子里，把蒸气通进去，而房子又是漏气的，因此很难蒸得干湿正好。有时蒸得太湿了，烟叶就会发霉，蒸得太干了，烟叶发脆，容易碎。因为机器破旧不全，生产出来的烟支也很不符合标准，往往不是太长就是太短，不是太粗就是太细，不是太轻就是太重。有的厂扯叶车间八面通风，碎叶吹得满地都是。裕华烟厂因为炉子不好，每箱烟竟要用煤二十八公斤（一般厂每箱烟只用十公斤左右）。
    有一些厂不但设备差，而且连流动资金都没有，靠借债度日。金蕾烟厂因为没钱，机器上的零件坏了，从来不添新的，只到旧货摊上去弄些旧零件来。有时弄来的零件太小了，就把机器锉掉一些装上去。但有一些大厂却资金十分充足，有的还因资金过多用不了而存在银行里。这些厂设备齐全，机器是新式的，厂房新而宽敞。像华美烟厂，还有新机器空着不生产，厂房和设备原来可供一千多人开日夜两班用，但现在是一班也没有开足。大东烟厂的厂房只用了三分之一，由于设备得不到充分的利用，也造成了生产上的浪费，三百多人生产，用的是可供一千多人生产的大炉子。
    从上面的一些情况可以看出，有些厂是没有条件单独合营的，连继续生产下去都很难。因此就采取大厂带小厂的办法，实行合并合营。这样，厂与厂之间就可以取长补短，把糟粕去掉，把多余的资金和搁着没用处的好的设备利用起来，发挥更大的作用。不要花钱增添什么，就可以搞成三个设备比较完备的大的合营烟厂。
    八月十一日，上海市人民委员会宣布了批准合营的工厂。准备合并合营的十一个烟厂，立即筹备进行清产估价工作。这时，资本家最担心的是自己要吃亏。公方代表就把“公平合理，实事求是”的清估原则，向资本家解释清楚。资本家嘴里说相信国家的政策，但心里还是有怀疑。有些资本家和公方代表讲话时试探口气，探不出什么，又到工人那里去试探。有些资本家甚至故意把机器的价钱估低一些，或是把好机器说成是坏机器，看公方代表是否真是实事求是。及至他们亲眼看见了公方代表和工人在清点估价时，做得公平合理，而且有事就同他们协商解决，原来怕吃亏的思想才慢慢消除了。公方代表一面依据公平合理、实事求是的原则，对每样东西，该估多少钱的，就估多少钱，资本家估高了，就向他提出，同他协商解决；资本家故意低估的，也向他指出估低了，并照实际价值作价。另一方面又依靠工人、职员，向资本家说清道理。如国华烟厂有一部卷烟车，明明只可再用五年，资本家却要估八年到十年。于是公方代表就发动工人，把机器拆开来，把机件上的毛病，一样样地仔细指给资本家看。事实摆在面前，资本家就心服了。金蕾烟厂的资本家把什么东西的价钱都估得特别高，别的资本家都有意见，但是他们也想把自己的东西估得高些，所以意见都放在肚皮里。公方代表就在五个要合并在一起的厂里，组织了一部分工人、技术人员，成立一个评比组，来统一评定五个厂的机器。于是资本家就把自己原来估得过高的数字自动减低了。
    公方代表在处理清产估价中资本家之间的矛盾时，也是根据公平合理、实事求是的原则来办事。像大运隆烟厂有一部卷烟机，实际只能算坏机器，可是资本家要算作好机器。别厂的资本家也觉得不该算作好机器。于是公方代表就请别的资本家来评，资本家陈继群说：“这车子，实实在在说是不好用了。”大运隆的资本家也就没话讲了。
    在人事安排问题上，因为资本家各人的情况不同，所以在开始的时候，有各种各样的顾虑。那些大厂的或是原在同业中有些地位的资本家，对自己今后的工作不担心，表现得很积极，但常瞧不起中小资本家。有些小厂资本家担心在合并后，地位要低了，收入要减少了。有些年纪老或是没有文化，工作能力差的资本家，怕合并后没有工作做，没有收入。“倒挂”（负债超过资产）厂的资本家，想趁此机会丢掉烂摊子，心里暗暗高兴；但又怕不给他安排职位，心里又担忧。
    针对这些思想，公方代表就向资本家说明我们安排人事的原则是量才录用，只要是守法的资本家，都可有职有权，但必须要尽责守职。在处理这个问题时，根据量才录用的原则，反复同资本家协商，像瑞伦烟厂的资本家王维林，不识字，工作能力差，但有一些生产技术。厂里准备叫他做技术顾问，但他自己提出来要当副厂长。于是公方代表就向他说明，合营后的副厂长和私营时的副厂长不同，以后在分工时，副厂长要独当一面，既要计划、布置工作，又要检查、总结、汇报工作。如果工作做不来，对工厂、对自己都不利。同时又向他说明技术顾问地位也不低，工作也很有价值。王维林一听，就觉得以后的副厂长，自己确是当不了，弄不好不是玩的，因此就同意了做技术顾问。
    上海私营卷烟厂采取“大厂带小厂”的办法实行合营后，已可以看出有许多好处。许多小厂过去因为设备差，管理落后，生产上就长期处于产品质量不好，成本高等严重局面。并入大厂后，利用了大厂先进的设备，这些因技术设备而引起的问题，就得到了解决。如裕华烟厂，过去因为锅炉不好，每箱烟要用煤二十八公斤多，现在，利用了华美烟厂的好锅炉，每箱烟只用煤七公斤多。并到大东烟厂去的一些小厂，原来烘丝机上的筒又短又小，烟丝挤在筒里搅不匀，结果往往有的烟丝已烘焦了，有的还是湿湿的。现在用大东烟厂的烘丝机，机上的筒又大又长，烟丝在里头搅得均匀，烘出来的烟丝干湿正好，也不会烘焦了。专卖公司规定每箱烟用烟叶一百零七斤。但在合并合营前，有些小厂总是要用一百一十斤，甚至到一百一十二斤。现在合并后的厂已经能达到专卖公司规定的标准了，而且烟的质量也比过去高。仅合并合营的华美烟厂，一月就能节约一万七千多斤烟叶。工人的技术特长也得到了发挥的机会，克服了劳动力的浪费。原来裕华烟厂有一个工人，修机器又快又好，但因为厂里机器少，整天没有多少事干。现在，他工作的劲头十足。这些并进大厂的小厂，过去福利设备很少，现在他们利用大厂的原有福利设备，劳动条件和物质生活也都得到了改善。例如，过去有些小厂没有取暖设备，包装车间里西北风从墙缝里钻进来，工人冷得手指发僵，并进大厂后，走进包装车间，却像春天一样温暖。
