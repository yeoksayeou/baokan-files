　　Broadly Develop Mass Shooting Sports
　　Lieutenant General Peng Shaohui, Vice Chairman and Chief Referee of the Organizing Committee of the International Friendship Shooting Competition
    The "1955 International Friendship Shooting Competition," organized by China at the suggestion of the USSR Volunteer Association for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force to the China Central National Defense Sports Club, is being held in our capital, Beijing, on the 17th of this month. We are honored to be able to hold such a large-scale event in our country, inviting so many outstanding shooting athletes from various countries to participate in friendly competition. According to the regulations of the International Friendship Shooting Competition, this competition can further consolidate the friendship between shooting athletes from participating countries and between countries, and enhance international connections in sports; at the same time, the competition can also broadly exchange shooting experiences for achieving excellent results and further develop shooting sports in the participating countries.
    Our people have always attached great importance to learning shooting techniques. In particular, due to the preparation for participating in the International Friendship Shooting Competition held in our country this year and the Shooting and Sports Review Conference of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held in October this year, China's shooting sports have been further developed. We have trained many outstanding shooters in the army and locally, and have begun to cultivate new athletes. In order to promote the widespread development of shooting sports, a modern shooting range has been built in the western suburbs of our capital. It is fully believed that through this International Friendship Shooting Competition and the efforts to learn the shooting techniques of outstanding athletes from the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, as well as learning their experience in developing shooting sports, it will create favorable conditions for further developing shooting sports in our country.
    Shooting sports have a long history in the Soviet Union. Many factories, enterprises, schools, and collective farms in the Soviet Union have permanent shooting sports organizations, which regularly conduct shooting training and organize various competitions. Because shooting sports are valued by the people and widely developed in the Soviet Union, during the Great Patriotic War, thousands of people who had received shooting training were able to severely strike the invaders after serving in the military. Many of them were trained to become excellent snipers, submachine gunners, and machine gunners in a very short period of time. They accurately hit the invaders. Soviet hero Ilya Grigoryev was such a shooter who was trained. During the war years, he alone eliminated 328 enemy soldiers and officers. In the post-war era, outstanding Soviet meritorious athletes and shooting masters have created many world records in international shooting competitions, winning new honors for the motherland. The Soviet shooting team won the championship at the 15th Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952. This autumn, the Soviet team also took first place with the highest total score at the European Shooting Championship held in Bucharest. The Soviet Union's experience in developing shooting sports is the best example for us to learn from. The achievements of other people's democratic countries in this regard are also worth learning.
    If shooting sports can be widely developed among the people, it will have extremely important significance for strengthening national defense and safeguarding world peace. Shooting sports are very meaningful and interesting, and are a sport that develops physical fitness and enhances the people's physique. It can not only improve people's shooting skills, but also cultivate people's very valuable qualities: tenacity, indomitable will, self-confidence, accuracy, quick response, and trust in their weapons; it can also cultivate collectivist ideas, unity and discipline, and other good qualities.
    The development of shooting sports in the army will help improve shooting coaching results, and will make every officer and soldier more familiar with and confident in the weapons in their hands; and this belief and skill is the material basis for despising the enemy and increasing one's confidence in victory. Through a series of training and competitions before and after this year's military shooting review, all troops and military schools will surely play a significant role in improving the quality of shooting coaching in our army.
    In order to promote and develop shooting sports among the people, to increase the interest of the people and youth in learning shooting, and to commend athletes who have achieved excellent results in shooting, the Physical Culture and Sports Commission of the People's Republic of China has formulated standards for awarding grade titles in the use of various weapons and in various events, up to the title of shooting sportsman. Shooting athletes who meet the standards prescribed by the grade title in formal competitions can obtain the honorary title of the corresponding shooter grade.
    The Party and the government have attached great importance to the development of sports. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, proceeding from the vital interests of the working people and the long-term prospects of socialist construction, have repeatedly instructed us to "develop sports and enhance the people's physique," and called on us to train ourselves into iron bodies, ready to serve the construction of socialism and the defense of the motherland. We wish the success of this conference and make this conference a good start for the widespread development of shooting sports in our country.

　　广泛地开展群众性的射击运动
　　国际友谊射击竞赛组织委员会副主席兼总裁判长　彭绍辉上将
    由苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会向我国中央国防体育俱乐部建议，而由中国组织的“一九五五年国际友谊射击竞赛”于本月十七日在我国首都——北京举行，我们以能够在我国举行规模这样大的，邀请这么多国家的优秀射击运动员来到我国进行友谊比赛而感到光荣。根据国际友谊射击竞赛章程的规定，通过这次竞赛可以进一步地巩固参加竞赛各国射击运动员和各国之间的友谊，和增进国际间在体育运动方面的联系；同时通过竞赛更可以广泛地交流取得优良成绩的射击经验和在参加竞赛的各国中进一步地开展射击运动。
    我国人民群众对学习射击技术，从来都是很重视的。特别是由于准备参加今年在我国举行的国际友谊射击竞赛和在今年十月举行的中国人民解放军射击与体育检阅大会，我国射击运动又有了进一步的发展。我们在军队和地方上训练了不少的优秀射手，并且已开始培养出新的运动员。为了推动射击运动的广泛开展，在我国首都西郊并兴建了一座近代化的射击场。完全可以相信：在通过这次国际友谊射击竞赛和努力学习苏联及各人民民主国家优秀运动员的射击技术和学习它们开展射击运动经验的基础上，必将为我国进一步开展射击运动创造良好的条件。
    射击运动在苏联已经有了很久的历史了。在苏联许多工厂、企业、学校和集体农庄中都有常设的射击运动组织，他们经常地进行射击训练并且组织各种比赛。由于在苏联射击运动被人民重视和得到广泛的开展，因而在卫国战争期间成千上万受过射击训练的人服兵役后即能沉重地打击侵略者，他们中许多人在很短时期里就被培养成为优秀的狙击手、冲锋枪手和机枪手。他们百发百中地打击着侵略者。苏联英雄伊里亚·哥里高里也夫就是被这样培养起来的射手，在战争年代里他一个人就消灭了三百二十八名侵略者的士兵和军官。而在战后的年代里，苏联优秀的功勋运动员和射击健将们，在参加国际射击竞赛中又创造出许多世界纪录，为祖国争取了新的荣誉。苏联射击代表队在一九五二年于赫尔辛基十五届奥林匹克运动会上取得了冠军。今年秋季在布加勒斯特所举行的欧洲射击冠军赛上苏联代表队也以总分第一取得了首位。苏联开展射击运动的经验是我们学习的最好的榜样。其他各人民民主国家在这方面的成就也值得我们学习。
    射击运动如能在人民群众中广泛地开展起来，这对增强国防力量、保卫世界和平都有着极为重要的意义。射击运动是非常有意义又是非常有兴趣的发展体育运动、增强人民体质的一种运动。它不仅能提高人们的射击技术而同时还能养成人们非常可贵的品质：坚韧性、不屈不挠的意志、自信心、准确性、反应敏锐及对自己武器的信赖；它还可以培养集体主义观念，团结一致和遵守纪律等优良作风。
    射击运动在军队中开展，将有助于射击教练成绩的提高，将使每个军官和士兵更加熟习和确信自己手中的武器；而这种信念和技能则是蔑视敌人和增强自己胜利信心的物质基础。全军各部队、各军事学校，通过今年全军射击检阅前后一系列的训练和比赛，对我军射击教练质量的提高必将起到显著的作用。
    为了在人民群众中宣传和开展射击运动，为了提高人民群众和青年学习射击的兴趣和表彰在射击中取得优良成绩的运动员，中华人民共和国体育运动委员会已经制定了授予在使用各种武器和各种项目中取得等级称号的标准，直至取得射击运动家的称号。射击运动员凡在正式比赛中打到等级称号所规定的标准，即可得到相应的射手等级的荣誉称号。
    党和政府对体育运动的发展给予了极大的重视，党中央和毛主席从劳动人民的切身利益和远大的社会主义建设前途着眼，一再指示“发展体育运动，增强人民体质”，并号召我们，锻炼成为铁的体质，准备为建设社会主义和保卫祖国服务。我们预祝本次大会的胜利成功，并使这次大会成为在我国广泛开展射击运动的良好开端。
