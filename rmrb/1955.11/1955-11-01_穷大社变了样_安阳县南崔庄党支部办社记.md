"The Poor Big Cooperative Has Changed Its Appearance"
    ——A Record of the Nan Cuizhuang Party Branch in Anyang County Running a Cooperative
    Song Binquan

    In the spring of 1953, the Nan Cuizhuang Welfare Agricultural Production Cooperative in Anyang County, Henan Province, was still a small, impoverished cooperative with only eighteen households. However, thanks to the correct leadership of the Party branch and the close unity of its members, it overcame numerous difficulties and has now become a large cooperative with eighty-eight households.

    All the members of this cooperative were poor and lower-middle peasants when it was established. After the land reform, the poor peasants in the village faced many difficulties in production due to their empty households, poor land, few livestock, and lack of farm tools. In the autumn of 1950, under the leadership of Party member Zhang Huaide, seven poor peasant households organized a temporary mutual aid team. As a result of mutual aid, wheat yields increased from one hundred jin to one hundred and twenty jin, demonstrating the superiority of being organized. In 1952, the team expanded from seven households to eleven (ten poor peasants, one lower-middle peasant) and changed from a temporary team to a permanent one. Although the mutual aid team expanded, the number of production tools did not increase significantly. The whole team had only seven small donkeys and four small carts. During the busy farming season, labor was used to pull plows and harrows, and manure and crops were transported by small carts and carried by people. Therefore, some villagers laughed at them, calling them a "poor big team, a carrying-pole brigade, and grasshopper donkeys." Despite this, the mutual aid team overcame difficulties that could not be overcome by individual farming. Problems such as grass eating seedlings, rain damaging the threshing ground, and missing sowing dates were eliminated, and yields increased. At the same time, by promoting the spirit of class friendship, they reduced and avoided disasters caused by natural and man-made calamities. For example, during the spring plowing, poor peasant Zhang Guangli became seriously ill. In addition to helping him find a doctor and buy medicine, the team members did all the farm work in his fields. His seven mu of cotton fields were harrowed three times, and the cotton seedlings emerged more neatly and robustly than in ordinary cotton fields. When Zhang Guangli left his sickbed and saw these cotton seedlings in the fields, he was moved to tears. In the autumn, his cotton yielded 150 jin per mu, which was an unprecedented good harvest. "There is great strength in being organized," was the unanimous conclusion of all team members, and it was also the ideological foundation for their determination to switch to a cooperative.

    In the winter of 1952, Zhang Guangli and several other poor peasant activists proposed to the Party branch that they wanted to switch to a cooperative. Zhang Huaide, the branch secretary, agreed to their request. To lead the team members in switching to a cooperative, he made several trips to old cooperatives in Boai and Taojiaying to learn from their experience. After that, the branch formulated a plan to switch to a cooperative and decided to merge with another mutual aid team to establish the Welfare Agricultural Production Cooperative (23 households).

    After switching to a cooperative, they were ridiculed by some wealthy households in the village, who said, "A bunch of paupers still want to run a cooperative? I've never seen a chicken feather fly to heaven." This young cooperative, composed of poor and lower-middle peasants, did face many difficulties at that time. During the tense spring plowing season, twelve of the eighteen households in the cooperative had nothing to eat. If Cui Fenglong, Zhang Shousheng, and other four poor peasant households did not work odd jobs for a day to earn some money, their families would run out of food. The production difficulties were even greater. The seven oxen were so thin from lack of fodder that they staggered and fell, unable to get up. They couldn't even afford ropes to tie the oxen and used straw ropes instead. Some people sarcastically said, "The big team is really something, even the ropes for tying the oxen are new." The broken cart, two earthen plows, and four old seeders that the members contributed as shares were also missing parts. They lacked everything, even whips to drive the animals. But even in these extremely difficult circumstances, thanks to the strong leadership of the Party branch and the active leadership of the Communist Party members, all the members were not intimidated by the difficulties. Zhang Huaide (the cooperative's director), the Party branch secretary, stated at a Party meeting: "I am a Communist Party member. No matter how difficult my family is, even if I don't eat for three days, I will insist on leading everyone to run the cooperative and never bow to difficulties." His words strengthened the confidence of the Party members in the cooperative. The Party members unanimously proposed: "We will resolutely work to the end, and we will make chicken feathers fly to heaven!" At the same time, the Party branch often used the stories of the Long March and other arduous struggles to educate the members and used the bright future of socialism to inspire them, which greatly increased the members' enthusiasm for overcoming difficulties. Everyone helped each other in production and life, and they promoted the spirit of class friendship. For example, when someone had nothing to eat, everyone took the initiative to collect grain for them. To solve the difficulty of livestock fodder, poor peasant Zhang Guangli (who had joined the Party) took the lead in selling two broken windows and two purlins from his house and gave the money to the cooperative to buy fodder. Under his influence, everyone turned dead objects into living ones and collected more than ten yuan to invest in the cooperative to solve the livestock fodder shortage. Old lower-middle peasant Li Yongxiang once wanted to withdraw from the cooperative, but under the education of the exemplary actions of Party members and the unity and friendship of poor peasant members, he also persisted. In this way, they not only survived the spring famine but also completed the spring sowing tasks for the cooperative's 120 mu of cotton fields on time. Before the wheat harvest, the state allocated a loan of 550 yuan to allow them to buy two mules and a cart, and the members' enthusiasm for production was even higher. At this time, people outside the cooperative also changed their tune, saying, "The poor big cooperative is about to change its appearance."

    Wealthy middle peasant Cui Jingao was not convinced, so he and several other wealthy middle peasants also started a cooperative. The Party branch sent a Party member to participate in the leadership. When this cooperative was established, there were eight wealthy middle peasant households and two poor peasant households. However, because the cooperative was controlled by individual wealthy middle peasants with serious capitalist ideas, they initially attempted to use their superior conditions of more carts, horses, and funds to crush the welfare cooperative. However, as a result of the competition, they failed, and the welfare cooperative won. After the autumn harvest, the Cui Jingao cooperative averaged 95 jin of cotton per mu and 160 jin of grain per mu. The welfare cooperative averaged 200 jin of grain per mu and 120 jin of cotton per mu on 118 mu of non-alkaline land, averaging 93 jin. Although the per-unit yield of cotton was not as high as that of the Cui Jingao cooperative due to the alkaline land, it exceeded the average yield of 90 jin per mu in the entire village. Why was it that such a poor cooperative could catch up with or even exceed a wealthy cooperative with fertile land, many carts and horses, and large investments? The main reason was that this cooperative implemented the principles of "running the cooperative diligently and thriftily." Because they didn't have money to buy fertilizer, the branch mobilized the members to seize every opportunity to carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign, building three large toilets, digging ten manure pits, and dismantling old walls and old kangs to use as fertilizer. This ensured that the grain and cotton fields had sufficient fertilizer, achieving the goal of small investment and large returns. Secondly, the branch led everyone to improve farming techniques. In cotton planting, they implemented wide ridges and dense planting. After sowing, to ensure full seedlings and eliminate missing seedlings and broken ridges, all the fields, except for a few alkaline lands, were transplanted and replanted. Subsequently, according to the growth of the cotton, they strengthened management in stages, ensuring that the cotton fields were ventilated and well-lit, matured early, and had fewer red bolls. As a result, the cooperative's cotton yield was high, and the selling price was high. But these new techniques did not work in the Cui Jingao cooperative. They retorted, "We didn't plant densely in the past, and we didn't harvest less." The results of this "competition" gave all the farmers in the village a profound education. Not only did they see the superiority of the cooperative, but they also saw how to run the cooperative well. The masses said, "The poor big cooperative has changed its appearance, and chicken feathers can fly around the sky." At that time, twenty-six households actively requested to join the cooperative, and some poor and lower-middle peasants even proposed: "If you don't let me join, I'll push my way in." As for the Cui Jingao cooperative, not only did no one want to join, but on the contrary, five or six households wanted to withdraw. The branch persuaded these households to work together to run the cooperative well.

    After the autumn harvest of 1953, various places promoted the Party's general line. The Party branch used the facts of the welfare cooperative to conduct a vivid socialist education for the farmers in the entire village, further enhancing the socialist awareness of the farmers inside and outside the cooperative. Mutual aid team leader Zhang Shunchang (lower-middle peasant) led all five members of his team to actively apply to join the cooperative. They proposed: "Wherever the Party leads us, we will go." In addition to the welfare cooperative, two more cooperatives were established in the village (including the Cui Jingao cooperative, which had been rectified and transformed). The welfare cooperative had expanded to thirty-five households. After the cooperative expanded, there were eighteen poor peasant households, thirteen lower-middle peasant households, and four new upper-middle peasant households. The poor and lower-middle peasants still accounted for the vast majority. In 1954, they achieved an even greater harvest than in 1953. This year, the three cooperatives merged in the autumn. Thus, except for fourteen landlord and rich peasant households and two controlled elements, all eighty-eight poor and middle peasant households in the village joined the cooperative, realizing village-wide cooperation. In the year since the merger, thanks to large-scale production, mechanized farming, and adherence to the state plan, the cooperative has achieved another bumper harvest this year. The wheat yield on 420 mu averaged 198 jin per mu, of which 26 mu were cultivated and sown by machines, averaging 267 jin per mu. The cotton yield on 1,004 mu (including 400 mu of wheat stubble cotton) is expected to be at least 132 jin per mu, with a total yield of more than 130,000 jin, exceeding the contracted production plan by more than 9,000 jin.

    This living fact shows that poor and lower-middle peasants are fully capable of running cooperatives well under the leadership of the Party, and the claim that poor peasants cannot run cooperatives well without wealthy peasants is wrong and does not conform to reality.

    Due to the annual increase in actual income, many members have changed from poor to rich. Among the thirty-five members of the original welfare cooperative, as early as the autumn grain unified purchase last year, twenty-eight households sold more than 3,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and deposited 1,500 yuan in the credit cooperative. According to the pre-distribution trial calculation results this year, the income of the remaining members of the cooperative's eighty-eight households, except for six elderly, weak, orphaned, and one township cadre, has generally increased compared with last year. Zhang Shousheng, the poorest poor peasant member, had a net surplus of 80 yuan last year, but this year his family of two can distribute 445 yuan. After deducting annual expenses, he can also deposit 200 yuan in the credit cooperative. It is estimated that after the final accounting this year, there will be more depositors than last year. Therefore, after issuing pre-distribution certificates and announcing the pre-distribution plan, the members' enthusiasm for production is even higher.

    Although the Nan Cuizhuang Party branch has achieved the above-mentioned achievements on the agricultural cooperation front, they are not complacent about this. After studying Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," according to the principle of "overall planning and strengthening leadership," the branch has formulated a plan to merge with Hanzhuang next year and strive to transition to an advanced cooperative in 1957. It is also actively leading all members to carry out cotton overproduction and grass cutting and fertilizer accumulation campaigns, striving to achieve the goals of the branch's overall plan with practical actions.

    “穷大社变了样”
    ——安阳县南崔庄党支部办社记
    宋斌全
    河南省安阳县南崔庄福利农业生产合作社在一九五三年春季还是一个贫困的十八户的小社，但由于党支部的正确领导，由于社员紧紧团结在一起，终于克服了重重困难，现在已成为八十八户的大社。
    这个社的成员在建社时全部是贫农和下中农。土地改革后该村贫农由于家底空，土地薄，少牲口，没农具，生产上遇到不少困难。一九五○年秋在党员张怀德带领下由七户贫农组织了一个临时互助组。互助的结果，麦子产量由一百斤提高到一百二十斤，开始显示了组织起来的优越性，一九五二年即由七户扩大到十一户（十户贫农，一户下中农），并由临时组转为常年组。互助组虽然扩大了，但是生产工具增加不多，全组只有七头小毛驴，四辆小红车，农忙时劳力拉犁拉耙，送粪、收庄稼全靠小车推、人担。因此村里有人笑他们“穷大组、扁担队、蚂蚱驴”。尽管如此，互助组还是克服了单干所不能克服的困难，草吃苗、雨淋场、误下种等现象都没有了，产量提高了。同时由于他们发扬了阶级友爱的精神，减少和避免了天灾人祸所给予的灾难。例如春耕中，贫农张光礼身得重病，互助组的组员除到他家去帮助请医生、买药外，给他把地里的一切农活做得一干二净，七亩棉田给耙了三遍，棉苗出的比一般棉田整齐肥壮。当张光礼离开病床到田间看到这些棉苗时，感动得掉下眼泪来。秋季他的棉花每亩收一百五十斤，这是从来没有的好收成。“组织起来力量大”，这是全体组员一致的结论，也是他们决心转社的思想基础。
    一九五二年冬季张光礼几户贫农积极分子就向党支部提出了转社的要求，支部书记张怀德同意他们的要求。为了领导组员转社，他几次跑到博爱、陶家营等老社投师访友，学习建社经验。之后，支部订出转社计划，确定同另一个互助组合并，成立了福利农业生产合作社（二十三户）。
    转社之后，他们受到了村里一些富裕户的讽刺，说“一伙穷光蛋还想办社哩，没有见过鸡毛能上天”。这个由贫农和下中农组成的年青的社，当时确实困难重重。正当春耕生产紧张期间，全社十八户就有十二户没吃的，崔凤龙、张守生等四户贫农一日不去打短工挣点钱，家里就要断炊。在生产上困难更大，七头耕牛因没草料喂，瘦得东倒西歪，跌倒了扶不起来，甚至连拴牛绳也买不起，用草绳拴牛。有人就讽刺说：“大组真不简单，拴牛绳都是新式的”。社员入股的一辆破大车、两张土犁、四张旧耧也都是缺胳膊少腿，要什么没什么，甚至连赶牲口的鞭子也没有。但就在这种极端困难的情况下，由于党支部的坚强领导，共产党员积极带头，全体社员并没有被困难所吓倒。党支部书记张怀德（社长）在党的会议上表示：“我是共产党员，家里再困难，三天不吃饭，也要坚持领导大家把社办下去，绝不向困难低头。”他的话坚定了社内党员办社信心。党员们一致提出：“坚决干到底，非叫鸡毛上天不行！”同时党支部经常以党的二万五千里长征等艰苦奋斗的故事教育社员，用社会主义的美好前途鼓舞社员，这就大大提高了社员克服困难的积极性。在生产上生活上大家互助互济，发扬了阶级友爱精神，如有人没吃的，大家就主动给凑粮食。为了解决牲口草料困难，贫农张光礼（他已入党）带头将自己房子上撤下来的两个破窗子、两根檩条卖了交给社内买草料。在他的影响下，大家变死物为活物，凑集了十来元投入社内解决牲口缺草困难。国家也给了这个合作社以有力的支持，贷给他们一万斤饼子。这样就完全解决了牲口吃料的困难。老下中农李永香曾一度想退社，但在党员的模范行动和贫农社员团结友爱的教育下，也坚持下来了。就这样，他们不但渡过了春荒，并且按时完成了全社一百二十亩棉田春耕播种任务。麦收前国家又拨贷款五百五十元，让他们买了两头骡子，一辆大车，社员生产情绪更加高涨起来。这时，社外的人也改变了口气，说：“穷大社快变样子了”。
    富裕中农崔金高不服气，就同其他几个富裕中农也来办社。支部就派了一个党员进去参加领导。这个社成立时，共有八户富裕中农，两户贫农。但是这个社被资本主义思想严重的个别富裕中农所掌握，所以一开始，就企图以他们的车、马、资金多这些优越条件，来挤垮福利社。可是比赛的结果，他们失败了，福利社胜利了。秋后总结，崔金高的社棉花平均每亩收九十五斤，谷子平均收一百六十斤；福利社种的谷子，单位产量则平均收到二百斤，棉花一百十八亩非碱地每亩收一百二十斤，平均九十三斤。棉花由于社内碱地多，单位产量虽不及崔金高的社，但超过了全村每亩九十斤的平均收成。为什么这样穷的一个社，而产量能够赶上甚至超过土地肥、车马农具多、投资力量大的一个富裕的社呢？主要原因是这个社贯彻执行了“勤俭办社”等方针。没有钱买肥料，支部就发动社员抓紧一切空隙开展积肥运动，修建了三个大厕所，挖了十个粪坑，拆旧墙旧炕充作肥料。这样就保证了谷田、棉田有充足的肥料，达到了投资少收益大的目的。其次，支部领导大家改进了耕作技术。在棉花播种中，他们实行了宽垅密植；在播种之后，为了保证全苗，消灭缺苗断垅现象，除了少数碱地外，又全部进行了移苗、补苗；随后根据棉花生长情况，分期加强管理，使棉田通风透光，成熟早，红花少，因而社的棉花产量高、售价大。但这些新的技术在崔金高的社是行不通的，他们反说：“过去不密植，也没少收。”这次“比赛”结果给全村农民一次深刻的教育，不但让他们看到了合作社的优越性，而且看到了怎样才能把社办好。群众说：“穷大社变了样，鸡毛也能绕天飞。”当时积极要求参加社的就有二十六户，甚至有些贫农和下中农提出：不叫我参加，拥也要拥进去。而崔金高的社呢，不但没人要求参加，相反地，有五六户要退社。支部就劝说这些户应当同心协力把社办好。
    一九五三年秋收后，各地宣传党的总路线，党支部就用福利社的事实向全村农民进行了一次生动的社会主义教育，使社内外农民的社会主义觉悟有了进一步提高。互助组长张顺昌（下中农）带领全组五户组员，积极申请入社，他们提出：“党领导我们到那里我们就到那里。”全村除福利社外，又办起了两个社（其中有经过整顿改造过的崔金高的社）。福利社已扩大到三十五户。社扩大之后，有贫农十八户，下中农十三户，新上中农四户，贫农和下中农仍占绝大多数。一九五四年，他们获得了比一九五三年更大的丰收。这年秋季三个社合并。这样，除十四户地主、富农和两户被管制分子外，全村八十八户贫、中农全部参加了合作社，实现了全村合作化。并社一年来，由于进行了大规模生产，实行了机器耕种和服从了国家计划，今年全社又获得丰收。麦子四百二十亩，单位产量平均一百九十八斤，其中机耕机播的二十六亩，平均每亩二百六十七斤。棉花一千零四亩（包括四百亩麦茬花），预计每亩最少可收一百三十二斤多，总产量可达到十三万多斤，可超过包产计划九千多斤。
    这个活生生的事实说明，贫农和下中农在党的领导下是完全可以把社办好的，认为贫农离开了富裕农民就办不好社的说法是错误的，不合乎实际情况的。
    由于实际收入的逐年增加，不少社员已由穷变富，原福利社的三十五户社员中，远在去年秋粮统购的时候，就有二十八户卖给国家余粮三千斤，向信用社存款一千五百元。根据今年预分试算结果，全社八十八户，除六户孤寡老弱和一个乡干部外，其余社员的收入则普遍较去年增加了。原来最穷的贫农社员张守生去年净余款八十元，今年两口人可分四百四十五元，除全年开支外，还可以向信用合作社储存二百元。估计今年决算后，将会出现比去年更多的存款户，所以经发预分证、公布预分方案后，社员生产情绪更高涨了。
    南崔庄党支部在农业合作化战线上虽然取得了上述成绩，但他们并不以此自满。他们学习毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告后，根据“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，支部已订出明年同韩庄并社、一九五七年争取转入高级社的计划，并积极领导全体社员开展棉花超产和割草积肥运动，以实际行动为实现支部全面规划的目标而奋斗。
