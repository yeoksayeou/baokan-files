Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 17th. The factories in Shanghai's cotton spinning, wool spinning, linen spinning, paper making, cigarette, enamelware, rice milling, and flour milling industries, which implemented joint state-private ownership this year, are currently preparing their 1956 production plans under the guidance of the relevant departments.

	Such planned arrangement of a year's production is a first for these factories since their establishment. During the private ownership period, production was largely blind and annual plans were impossible to create. Even when accepting processing tasks or having products exclusively sold by state-owned commercial departments, they could only arrange production based on monthly or quarterly processing or exclusive sales contracts signed with state-owned commercial departments. Now, in addition to preparing annual production plans, the factories are also preparing to set various production quotas and quality indicators. Woolen mills are preparing plans for trial production of new varieties, and some factories in the cotton spinning, paper making, and cigarette industries are also preparing cost reduction plans, labor plans, and financial plans for next year.

	When preparing annual plans, the factories made appropriate adjustments to product varieties and labor organization to meet national needs. For example, before the cotton spinning, wool spinning, and paper making factories prepared their plans this time, the relevant departments comprehensively considered the equipment conditions and production situations of each factory and readjusted the product varieties. The cotton spinning, paper making, and cigarette factories changed unreasonable labor organization. Shenxin No. 2 Cotton Mill decided to thoroughly overhaul and supplement the equipment in the opening and cleaning workshop to balance the production capacity of each process.

	This newspaper Shanghai, November 17th dispatch Shanghai’s Songshan District's nine private wool shops have all implemented joint state-private ownership. A joint state-private ownership conference was held on November 15th, formally establishing the joint state-private Songshan District Wool Shop. This is the first instance of all private businesses in a district in Shanghai implementing joint state-private ownership, marking new progress in the socialist transformation of capitalist commerce in Shanghai. The joint state-private Songshan District Wool Shop has five retail outlets, located on several main streets in Songshan District. All retail outlets officially began operating as a new type of enterprise starting from the 16th.

	Prior to this, these nine wool shops had already become distributors for state-owned companies. However, the backward business management practices of capitalist enterprises still existed, and the difficulties in business operations could not be fundamentally resolved. After several consultations between labor and capital in each shop, it was felt that further transformation was needed. Based on the applications of the capitalists of these shops, the People's Government approved their full implementation of joint state-private ownership in early November this year.

	In the process of preparing for joint state-private ownership, both public and private parties fully consulted and fairly and reasonably determined the principles for clearing and evaluating enterprise assets. To make the distribution of the retail network more reasonable, the original nine shops have been adjusted to five. In terms of personnel arrangements, talent was also used appropriately.

	The further change in the nature of the enterprise greatly increased the enthusiasm of the workers. Shop assistants have made guarantees to further improve service attitudes under the leadership of the public representatives, unite with private practitioners, and work together to improve business management. The capitalists of the original nine wool shops also expressed their willingness to accept the leadership of the public representatives, study hard, and transform their thinking.

　　上海今年公私合营的八个行业的工厂
　　第一次有计划地安排生产
　　上海嵩山区私营绒线商店全部公私合营
    新华社上海十七日电　上海市今年实行公私合营的棉纺、毛纺、麻纺、造纸、卷烟、搪瓷、碾米、面粉等八个行业的工厂，最近都在主管部门的指导下编制一九五六年度的生产计划。
    这样有计划地安排一年的生产，是各厂建厂以来第一次。它们在私营时期，生产带有很大的盲目性，不可能编制年度计划；在接受国营商业部门加工任务或产品由国营商业部门包销时期，也只能根据每月或每季同国营商业部门订立的加工或包销合约来安排生产。现在，各厂除了编制年度的生产计划外，还准备订出各种生产定额和质量指标。毛纺织厂正在编制试制新品种的计划，棉纺、造纸、卷烟等行业有些厂也在编制明年度的降低成本计划、劳动计划和财务计划等。
    各厂在编制年度计划时，对产品品种和劳动组织等方面作了适当的调整，以适应国家需要。如棉纺、毛纺、造纸等厂这次编制计划前，都由主管部门通盘考虑了各厂的设备条件和生产情况，重新调整了产品品种。棉纺、造纸、卷烟等厂改变了不合理的劳动组织。申新第二棉纺织厂决定彻底检修和补充清花车间的设备，以使各个工序的生产能力得到平衡。
    本报上海十七日电上海市嵩山区九家私营绒线商店全部实行公私合营，十一月十五日举行了公私合营大会，正式成立公私合营嵩山区绒线商店。这是上海市私营商业在一个区的范围内全部实行公私合营的先例，标志着上海市对资本主义商业进行社会主义改造的新进展。公私合营嵩山区绒线商店下设五个门市部，分设在嵩山区的几条主要街道上。各门市部从十六日起都正式以新型企业的面貌开始营业。
    在这以前，这九家绒线商店都已经成为国营公司的经销店。但是资本主义企业经营管理落后的现象仍然存在，业务经营中的困难仍不能根本解决，各商店劳资双方经过多次协商，都感到需要进一步进行改造。人民政府根据这些商店资本家的申请，在今年十一月上旬批准它们全部实行公私合营。
    在筹备公私合营的过程中，公私双方充分进行了协商，公平合理地确定了清估企业资产的原则。为使零售网的分布合理，已经将原来的九个店调整为五个店。在人事安排方面，也做到了量才任用。
    企业性质的进一步改变，使职工们的积极性大为提高。店员们纷纷提出保证，要在公方代表的领导下，进一步改善服务态度，团结私方从业人员，共同努力改进经营管理。原来九家绒线商店的资方，也表示要接受公方代表的领导，努力学习，改造思想。
