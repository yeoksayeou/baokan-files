Rapid Steelmaking
By our reporter, Gu Ye

On September 20th of this year, the Ministry of Heavy Industry made a decision to launch a rapid steelmaking campaign nationwide. Implementing this decision will greatly increase steel production, thereby accelerating the progress of China's industrialization.

Leaders of steel plants are not unaware of the significance of promoting advanced steelmaking experiences. However, many say that there are difficulties in implementing rapid steelmaking. For example, some say: the smelting time has already been shortened a lot compared to the past, the potential has been exhausted, and there is no more "oil" to be squeezed; some say: our furnaces are old and cannot withstand the high temperatures of rapid steelmaking. Some also doubt: can our workers' technical level be sufficient to implement rapid steelmaking? Can the quality of the steel be guaranteed?

These ideas are far behind reality. Just one example below is enough to prove it: after Kolesnikov, an excellent Soviet steelworker who came to China to participate in the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Congress, demonstrated rapid steelmaking in Anshan, Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places, workers in various factories achieved new achievements under the original equipment and original technical conditions. Workers at Anshan Iron and Steel Plant smelted a furnace of steel in five hours and fifty-five minutes on the No. 5 open hearth furnace (three hours and thirty-five minutes shorter than the planned time).

However, some people are still saying: Anshan's furnaces are better than ours, they can implement rapid steelmaking, but we cannot.

In order to strengthen the confidence of leaders and all employees of steel enterprises in implementing rapid steelmaking, not long ago, the Ministry of Heavy Industry took advantage of Kolesnikov's performance at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant to organize representatives of its affiliated steel enterprises to visit Taiyuan for study.

In recent years, the production of the steelmaking department of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has greatly improved. However, compared with other steelmaking enterprises, it is the worst in terms of smelting time or hearth utilization factor. What is particularly serious is that when Kolesnikov came to perform this time, all the open hearth furnaces in the steelmaking department were in a state of extreme difficulty: the furnace roof was thin, the front and rear walls were red, the gas conveying pipe was not very smooth, and the temperature of the regenerator was not high. These made the smelting time of each furnace of steel longer than before. In order to change this situation, the plant specially selected some of the best workers to form a steelmaking group to practice. However, production continued as before: one furnace took more than six hours, and the next furnace took more than nine hours. People anxiously said: "At this rate, the plan will definitely not be completed!"

At this critical moment, Kolesnikov came to Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. He went to the workshop to feel the temperament of the furnace and looked at the workers' operations. He decided to perform rapid steelmaking on the No. 3 open hearth furnace, which everyone considered to be in the worst condition, without making any special preparations. This made the workers both happy and worried. They were happy because every time Soviet experts came to the plant, everyone could learn a lot of valuable things, thereby improving their production technology. They were worried because what would happen if rapid steelmaking was not successful on such a furnace?

On the morning of October 30th, Kolesnikov's performance began.

From the beginning, the workers felt the perseverance of this Soviet steelworker. He calmly put on his blue work clothes and heavy canvas boots and began to meticulously arrange various tasks. At 6:07, when the molten steel from the previous furnace had not yet been completely discharged, he broke the previous practice of waiting until the molten steel was discharged before starting to repair the furnace. He picked up a shovel and led everyone to shovel the furnace repair material into the furnace shovel by shovel. In this way, not long after the molten steel was discharged, the hearth was repaired and loading began.

People who were visiting and studying in front of the No. 3 open hearth furnace were attracted by every skilled and agile action of Kolesnikov. When directing the loading, he would first look at the furnace roof temperature and see how the steel material should be distributed in the furnace for each bucket of material loaded. Then, he would rush to the material rack and ask the loading driver to connect the bucket of material he had selected and load it into the furnace. He himself would return to the side of the furnace door and direct the driver to pour the large pieces of scrap steel that were difficult to melt into the place with the highest temperature and pour the materials that were easy to melt into the place with the low temperature. If the pouring was not even, he would ask the driver to flip the bucket and level the material. Pang Dingchang, an engineer in the steelmaking department, excitedly told people: "The loading time has been shortened by twenty-three minutes compared to normal!"

Yang Xi'en from Tianjin Steel Plant found the key to advanced experience. He said: This is a very important link in shortening steelmaking time. Not only should the loading be fast, but it should also create favorable conditions for the next process—melting the steel material—during the loading process. In the past, steelworkers did not care about loading, and only asked the second assistant to direct it. At that time, they did not care about the size of the scrap steel, as long as the material was stuffed into the furnace. As a result, the materials loaded from the three furnace doors piled up into three small mountains. The material on the south side melted, the material on the north side did not melt, the surrounding materials were melted, and there were still several large lumps in the middle. Those large lumps were very difficult to melt.

During the process of melting the steel material, Kolesnikov constantly ran to the front of the furnace door that was spewing flames, looked at the color of the furnace roof, and observed the burning situation in the furnace. After a while, he went to the window to see what kind of smoke was coming out of the chimney, and then he went to see if the gas was burning completely. When he found that the furnace roof was turning white and there was a danger of being burnt, he would ring the bell to direct the switching of the direction of air and gas, so that the furnace material could melt faster under the condition of not burning the furnace roof and maintaining the highest temperature in the furnace. In order to melt the furnace material better, when he found that the slag was too thick, he immediately grabbed the wooden rake with the workers, stretched the wooden rake into the furnace door, and raked the slag out, so that the heat quickly entered the molten steel. Steelworker Fan Zhiguo said: "In the past, we would not take the initiative to rake the slag in this situation, and we would always wait for the temperature to rise. This wait often dragged on for three hours."

The most important moment was approaching. People stared at the instrument emitting the bell sound, watching it report how much the carbon content in the molten steel had been reduced. At 11:34, a stream of scalding molten steel surged out of the tap hole and quickly poured into the huge steel ladle. At this time, joyful news came from the loudspeaker: "The smelting time for this furnace of steel is five hours and twenty-seven minutes, which is two hours and one minute shorter than the steelmaking time under the same conditions!"

The entire workshop was in an uproar. Representatives from various steel plants and workers who were operating all rushed to Comrade Kolesnikov to congratulate him. When he and the old worker Fan Zhiguo hugged each other tightly, he said, "This is a gift I give to my Chinese counterparts."

Kolesnikov pointed out the way for Chinese steelworkers to improve production in existing enterprises. In Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant alone, as long as the smelting time for each furnace of steel is shortened by two hours and one minute, the annual steel output in 1955 can be increased by 25.16 percent. Now, the argument that existing enterprises cannot improve production is gone. Representatives from various factories who came to Taiyuan to visit Kolesnikov's rapid steelmaking performance all firmly stated that they would seriously study his operating technical experience and further improve China's steel production.

Now, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant has been making steel according to Kolesnikov's method. The furnace has also become better, and the gas is coming normally. The time for the seven consecutive furnaces of steel smelted on the No. 3 open hearth furnace has been greatly shortened, and one of them took only five hours and twenty-six minutes. The quality of the steel is also very good. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant also overfulfilled its steelmaking task in October because of this. The No. 2 open hearth furnace of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant is old and will be overhauled in mid-November. The average smelting time for each furnace of steel in October was more than eight hours. After the workers implemented rapid steelmaking from November 1st to 6th, the smelting time for each furnace of steel has been maintained at around six hours, and two of them took only five hours and forty-two minutes!

The fact that Kolesnikov performed rapid steelmaking in China proves that the promotion of some advanced experiences is not limited by equipment conditions; as long as the leading departments organize performances and promotions in a planned way, production can be greatly improved.

　　快速炼钢
　　本报记者　顾页
    今年九月二十日，重工业部作出了关于在全国开展快速炼钢的决定。贯彻执行这个决定，就可以大大提高钢的产量，从而加速我国工业化的进展。
    各炼钢厂的领导同志对于推广炼钢的先进经验的意义并不是不了解的。可是，许多人都说有困难不能实行快速炼钢。如有的说：熔炼时间比过去已经缩短了很多，潜力已经挖尽，再没有“油水”了；有的说：我们的炉子老旧了，承受不住快速炼钢时的高温。也有人怀疑说：实行快速炼钢，我们工人的技术水平够吗？钢的质量能够保得住吗？
    这些想法是远远落后于现实的。只要举出下边一个例子就可以证明了：来我国参加全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会的苏联优秀炼钢工人科列斯尼科夫在鞍山、上海、重庆等地表演了快速炼钢以后，各厂工人们就在原有设备、原有的技术条件下取得了新的成就。鞍钢炼钢厂工人就在五号平炉上，用五小时五十五分钟（比计划时间缩短了三小时三十五分）炼了一炉钢。
    但是，还有人在说：鞍钢的炉子比我们的好，它可以实行快速炼钢，我们则不能。
    为了坚定各炼钢企业的领导人员和全体职工实行快速炼钢的信心，不久以前，重工业部趁科列斯尼科夫到太原钢铁厂表演的机会，组织所属炼钢企业的代表到太原参观学习。
    这几年来，太原钢铁厂炼钢部的生产有了很大的提高。但是，跟其他炼钢企业比较起来，无论就冶炼时间或炉底利用系数来说，都是最差的。特别严重的是，这次科列斯尼科夫来表演的时候，正是炼钢部所有的平炉都处于一种极端困难的时期：炉顶薄了，前后墙发红了，煤气输送管也不大畅通了，蓄热室的温度不高了。这些，就使得每炉钢的熔炼时间都比以前拉长。为了改变这种情况，这个厂特别抽调了一些比较优秀的工人组成一个炼钢组，进行演习。然而，生产仍然按照老样子进行：上一炉是六个多小时，下一炉却是九个多小时。人们焦急地说：“这样下去，计划准完不成了！”
    在这个紧要的时刻，科列斯尼科夫来到了太原钢铁厂。他到车间摸了一下炉子的脾气，看了看工人们的操作，就决定要在大家认为条件最坏的三号平炉上表演快速炼钢，并且不要作任何特殊准备。这件事，真叫工人们又喜又忧。喜的是，每次苏联专家到厂里来，大家都能够学到很多宝贵的东西，从而提高自己的生产技术。忧的是，在这样的炉子上实行快速炼钢，不成功怎样办？
    十月三十日清晨，科列斯尼科夫的表演开始了。
  一开始，工人们就感到这个苏联炼钢工人的毅力。他从容地穿上蓝色工作服和那双沉重的帆布短靴，开始一丝不苟地安排着各种工作。六点零七分，上
  一炉钢的钢水还未出完的时候，他打破了以往等到钢水出完才开始补炉的惯例，拿起铁锹，领着大伙
  一锹一锹地往炉内投送补炉材料。这样，钢水出完后没多时，炉底就补好，开始装料了。
    站在三号平炉跟前参观学习的人们，为科列斯尼科夫的每一个纯熟敏捷的动作所吸引了。在指挥装料的时候，每装一斗料，他都先看看炉顶温度，看看钢料在炉内应该如何分布，然后再赶到料架跟前，叫装料司机接上他选好的那斗料向炉内装去。而他自己，就再返回到炉门旁边，指挥司机把难熔化的大块废钢倒到温度最高的地方，把容易熔化的料倒到温度低的地方。如果倒的不均匀，他就叫司机翻转料斗，把料推平。炼钢部工程师庞定昌兴奋地告诉人们：“装料时间比平常缩短了二十三分钟！”
    天津钢厂的杨锡恩同志找到先进经验的所在了。他说：这是缩短炼钢时间的很重要的一环，不仅装料要快，而且在装料过程中为下一道工序——熔化钢料——创造有利的条件。在过去，炼钢工人是不管装料的，只叫二助手来指挥。那时候，也不管废钢大小，只要把料塞进炉内就算完事。结果，从三个炉门装的料，就堆成了三个小山，南面的料熔开了，北面的料没熔开，周围的料化完了，当中还有几个大疙瘩。那些大疙瘩熔化起来就很费事。
    在钢料熔化的过程中，科列斯尼科夫不断地跑到喷出火苗的炉门跟前，看炉顶的颜色，观察着炉内燃烧的情况。一会儿，他走到窗口跟前去探望烟囱里冒的什么烟，一会儿又去看一看煤气是否燃烧的完全。当他发现炉顶发白，有被烧化危险的时候，他就去敲钟指挥转换空气和煤气的方向，以便在不烧化炉顶而又保持炉内最高温度的条件下，让炉料更快地熔化。为了把炉料熔化得更好，当他发现渣子太厚，立即同工人一起抓住木扒，把木扒伸进炉门，往外扒渣，使热量很快传入钢水。炼钢工人樊志国说：“过去遇到这种情形，我们就不会主动扒渣，老等温度升高。这一等，往往就拖长了三小时。”
    最重要的瞬间临近了。人们盯着发出电铃声的仪表，看它报出钢水里已经降低了多少含炭量。十一点三十四分，一股滚热的钢水汹涌地冲出了出钢口，迅速地倾泻到巨大的钢水包里。这时从扩音器里传出了令人欢乐的消息：“这一炉钢冶炼的时间是五小时二十七分，比在同一条件下炼钢时间缩短了两小时零一分钟！”
    整个车间为之轰动了。各炼钢厂的代表们，正在操作的工人们，一齐拥到科列斯尼科夫同志跟前，向他祝贺。当他和老工人樊志国紧紧地拥抱在一起的时候，他说：“这是我献给中国同行的礼物。”
    科列斯尼科夫给我国钢铁工人指明了提高现有企业生产的道路。仅是太原钢铁厂一个工厂，只要每炉钢缩短熔炼时间两小时零一分，一九五五年钢的年产量就可以提高百分之二十五点一六。现在，关于现有企业无法提高生产的论调已经没有了。来太原参观科列斯尼科夫快速炼钢表演的各厂代表们都坚决表示：要认真地学习他的操作技术经验，进一步提高我国的钢铁生产。
    现在，太原钢铁厂已经按照科列斯尼科夫的方法炼钢了。炉子也变好了，煤气来的也正常了。在三号平炉上一连炼的七炉钢，时间都大大缩短了，其中有一炉只用了五小时二十六分。钢的质量也很好。太原钢铁厂在十月份还因此超额完成了炼钢任务。太原钢铁厂的二号平炉，炉龄已衰老，十一月中旬就要中修了，十月里每炉钢的平均冶炼时间都在八小时以上。工人们在十一月一日到六日，实行快速炼钢以后，每炉钢的冶炼时间都一直保持在六小时左右，其中有两炉只用五小时四十二分钟！
    科列斯尼科夫在我国表演快速炼钢的事实证明：有些先进经验的推广是不受设备条件的限制的；只要领导部门有计划地组织表演，组织推广，就可以大大提高生产。
