In the correct line of agricultural cooperation stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, over the past three years, 650,000 semi-socialist agricultural production cooperatives have emerged in rural areas across the country. These cooperatives have proven a truth to male and female peasants: only cooperation can increase crop yields, increase peasant household income, and improve peasants' living standards. Therefore, not only are male peasants elated and their socialist enthusiasm constantly rising, but female peasants are equally elated and love socialism. These 650,000 cooperatives have also presented women with another truth, that is, only by participating in agricultural cooperatives and collective labor can rural working women achieve true equality between men and women and the complete emancipation of women. Facts have proven that wherever cooperatives develop, the labor enthusiasm of women is stimulated due to work points being recorded according to labor and more pay for more work, and more and more women participate in cooperative collective labor. At the same time, collective labor enables women to learn and improve their skills and earn work points, thus demonstrating the independent economic status of women and gaining respect from their families and society, thereby greatly increasing women's enthusiasm for taking the road of cooperation. Under these circumstances, a high tide of the agricultural cooperative movement has emerged everywhere in the vast rural areas of the country. This is entirely in line with the laws of motion development.

However, there are still many people who underestimate the socialist enthusiasm of women. They believe that "men have a high tide, but women do not." Some even believe that women are "roadblocks" to socialism. In fact, most new and old lower-middle peasant women and poor peasant women are eager to establish cooperatives. For example, Ma Danniang, a poor peasant woman from Kongtui Township, Shandong, wanted to join the cooperative. Just as the director of the prefectural women's federation, accepting the task of the prefectural committee, went to the countryside to shrink the cooperatives, she advised Ma Danniang not to join the cooperative, saying that the leadership was too weak and unable to lead. Ma Danniang was very angry and questioned her why she didn't want poor peasants, and said, "If you can't lead, let us do it ourselves!" This is a very good proof. Some comrades lack sensitivity to new things and new situations, and lack correct class analysis. They do not know that women are also in a new era and have also become masters of the country and society. Rural women are also peasants, and there are also differences between rich middle peasants, new and old lower-middle peasants, and poor peasants among them. New and old lower-middle peasant and poor peasant women also share the same interests and thoughts as the peasants of their respective classes. How could it be possible that "men have a high tide, but women do not"? This shows that some people do not look at women from a class perspective, nor do they look at women from the perspective of historical evolution and social development. They view women without distinction. Therefore, the general concept of "women's backwardness" remains unchanged in their minds forever. Lenin said: "This work, which was started by the Soviet regime, can only move forward when millions of women, not hundreds of women, participate in this work throughout Russia. At that time, we believe that the cause of socialist construction will be unbreakable." Stalin said:
"They (referring to women) can only obtain equal status with men in collective farms." Their words are both the theory of practice and the practice of theory. Our Party must promote the socialist enthusiasm of male and female peasants and actively lead them to advance together in leading the socialist transformation of agriculture. It is undeniable that in the process of socialist transformation of agriculture, the socialist enthusiasm of women has been supported and promoted by the Party; however, the suppression of this enthusiasm from various aspects is greater than that encountered by male peasants. The feudal remnants of valuing men over women still blind the eyes of many people, making them unable to see the socialist enthusiasm of women, the role of women in developing and consolidating cooperatives, and the huge potential labor force of women. Therefore, they do not consciously promote women's socialist enthusiasm and actively lead women and male peasants to advance together. For example, some comrades who lead rural work do not comprehensively plan from the leadership level and rationally arrange the labor force in areas with a large labor force, and use the surplus labor force to develop production; instead, they emphasize that there is too much labor force and cannot mobilize women, simply using the method of excluding women to solve the problem. Some even put on big hats and say: "Women are narrow-minded and always want to earn work points." For example, in some places where labor is scarce and women actively participate in labor, there are even phenomena such as women getting sick from overwork or having miscarriages, and they often do not receive reasonable care from the leadership. For example, in the issue of equal pay for equal work in production, although many places pay attention to solving this, there are still many places that ignore this very much. All of the above are detrimental to women's enthusiasm for participating in production and socialism.

Our Women's Federation lacks sensitivity to the arrival of the new high tide of the socialist mass movement in rural areas in the leadership of rural women's work. Therefore, we lack the necessary ideological and organizational preparation for the arrival of the high tide of the cooperative mass movement. Some comrades are afraid that the Women's Federation will not be able to exert its strength in the high tide of the movement, and they are inevitably somewhat panicked; some worry that there are too few women cadres and that they cannot equip the cadres needed for the new cooperatives and establish women's work in the new cooperatives; some feel that they have not yet learned the skills of running cooperatives and worry that they will not be able to lead the women masses, thus generating "fear of cooperatives" and "avoiding cooperatives" emotions. From these aspects, it can be seen that our Women's Federation is also far behind the masses in leadership, and this phenomenon must be quickly overcome.

The agricultural cooperative movement is a socialist revolutionary movement that is more complex and has sharper struggles than the land reform, and it is a revolutionary movement in which hundreds of millions of male and female peasants have consciously and willingly acted. This movement requires not only the entire Party to comprehensively plan and strengthen leadership according to the instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong; as a mass women's organization led by the Party, the All-China Women's Federation and women's federations at all levels should also assure the Party that they will quickly clear their minds, raise their awareness, concentrate their efforts, and bravely, actively, and practically throw themselves into the movement. Every woman cadre must learn to run cooperatives and become an expert in running cooperatives; every woman cadre must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism, study the various policies for the socialist transformation of agriculture and various advanced experiences in running cooperatives, so that they can become excellent propagandists and organizers in promoting the cooperative movement under the leadership of the Party. It is necessary to go deep among the women masses and strengthen socialist political work. Political work must be done deeply, broadly, and thoroughly, and done repeatedly and painstakingly for a long time, targeting the masses' level of understanding and ideological situation. Only by exerting such subjective efforts can we guarantee the healthy and victorious development of the cooperative movement. We cannot deny the fact that women are still relatively backward. Precisely because of this, it is even more important to carry out such political propaganda work for women in rural areas. Women's grassroots organizations are the best organizational form for carrying out political work among women. This organizational form must be adapted to the situation of cooperative development. Therefore, our Women's Federation must, under the leadership of the Party, combine the development and rectification of cooperatives, rectify women's grassroots organizations at any time, so that it is sound, pure, and able to serve the promotion of the cooperative movement. It is also necessary to assist the Party in proposing plans for training women cadres, women activists, and women technicians when the Party makes unified plans to train cadres, activists, and technicians, and after the Party approves them, they become part of the entire plan. In short, the entire rural work of the Women's Federation, from ideological work to organizational work, must be closely centered on the cooperative movement.

The Women's Federation must, under the leadership of the Party, lead hundreds of millions of women masses to become a huge force for the Party to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture. To make the women's organization such a force, the Party's strengthening of leadership over the women's organization is the decisive key. To this end, we put forward the following suggestions to party committees at all levels in leading rural women's work:

1. Party committees at all levels must continue to implement the policy of mobilizing and educating men and women together when mobilizing the vast number of peasants to participate in the agricultural cooperative movement. To make socialist education known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, it is necessary to carry out more educational work for women.

2. Women's ideological awareness and attitude towards agricultural cooperation are basically determined by their class status and economic life. Therefore, we must also correctly use the method of class analysis and implement the class line when dealing with women masses. It is incorrect to mechanically regard women as "backward" or as a force that can be relied upon in the agricultural cooperative movement.

3. In the various specific measures of agricultural production cooperatives, ensure the due rights and interests of women, reasonably take care of and gradually solve the practical difficulties of women.

4. Consciously train women cadres to participate in the leadership of cooperation. Special attention should be paid to training women activists from poor and lower-middle peasants, so that every cooperative has cadres and every township has banners.

### 农业合作化运动中必须贯彻执行男女农民一齐发动的方针

    农业合作化运动中必须贯彻执行男女农民一齐发动的方针
    中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席　章蕴
    在党中央和毛泽东同志所规定的农业合作化的正确路线指导之下，三年来，全国农村已经出现了六十五万个半社会主义的农业生产合作社。这些合作社向男女农民证明了一条真理：只有合作化才能增加农作物产量，增加农民家庭收入，提高农民生活水平。因此，不仅男农民欢欣鼓舞，社会主义积极性不断高涨，女农民也同样欢欣鼓舞，热爱社会主义。六十五万个合作社又向妇女提出了另一条真理，那就是农村劳动妇女只有参加农业合作社，参加集体劳动，才能导致真正的男女平等和妇女的彻底解放。事实已经证明，凡是合作社发展的地方，由于按劳记分，多劳多得，刺激了妇女的劳动热情，参加合作社集体劳动的妇女就越来越多；同时，集体劳动使妇女学会和提高了本领，挣得了工分，从而显示了妇女独立的经济地位，获得了家庭和社会的尊重，因此大大提高了妇女走合作化道路的积极性。在这种情况下，全国广大农村到处出现了农业合作化运动的高潮。这是完全合乎运动发展规律的。
  但是现在还有许多人对妇女群众的社会主义积极性估计不足，他们认为“男的有高潮，女的没有高潮”。甚至认为妇女是社会主义的“拦路人”。实际上一般新、老下中农妇女和贫农妇女是迫切要求办社的。例如山东孔推乡贫农妇女马大娘要求入社，正遇着专区妇联主任接受了地委的任务下乡，收缩合作社，她劝马大娘不要入社，说领导太弱，领导不起来，马大娘很生气，质问她为什么不要贫农，并说：“你们领导不起来，让我们自己办好啦！”这就是一个很好的证明。有些同志缺乏对新事物新情况的敏感，缺乏正确的阶级分析，他们不知道妇女同样是处在新时代，同样作了国家和社会的主人，农村妇女也是农民，她们中间也同样存在着富裕中农、新、老下中农和贫农的区别，新、老下中农和贫农妇女，也是和同她们所属阶层的农民利害一致，思想一致的，怎么可能会“男的有高潮、女的没有高潮”呢？这就说明有些人不是用阶级观点来看妇女，不是从历史演变和社会发展上来看妇女，没有区别地来看妇女，因此，“妇女落后”这个笼统的概念在他们的脑子里就永远不变。列宁说：“这个由苏维埃政权所开始的工作，只有在全俄国，不是数百个妇女，而是千百万妇女参加这一工作的时候，才能够向前推进的。那个时候，我们相信，社会主义建设事业，便牢不可破了。”斯大林说：
  “她们（指妇女）只有在集体农庄里面才有可能获得与男子平等的地位。”他们的话都是实践的理论，理论的实践。我们的党在领导农业的社会主义改造中，必须发扬男女农民的社会主义积极性，积极领导男女农民一齐前进。不可否认，在农业的社会主义改造过程中，妇女们的社会主义积极性是得到了党的支持和发扬的；但是，这种积极性所遇到的来自各方面的压抑，比男农民遇到的更多更大，重男轻女的封建残余思想，还蒙蔽着许多人的眼睛，使人看不见妇女的社会主义积极性，看不见妇女在发展和巩固合作社中间的作用，看不见妇女的巨大的潜在劳动力，因而不去有意识地发扬妇女的社会主义积极性，积极地领导妇女和男农民一起前进。例如有些领导农村工作的同志对劳动力多的地区，不从领导上全面规划，合理地安排劳动力，把剩余的劳动力用于发展生产；而是强调劳动力过多，不能发动妇女，简单地用排斥妇女的办法来解决问题。有的还扣上大帽子说：“妇女狭隘，总是想挣工分。”又例如有些劳动力缺乏，妇女积极参加劳动的地方，甚至有妇女累病、累得小产等现象发生，而往往得不到领导上的合理照顾。再例如在生产中同工同酬的问题，固然有许多地方对此是注意解决的，但是也仍然有许多地方对此非常忽视。以上种种，都是对妇女参加生产和社会主义的积极性有损害的。
    我们妇联在农村妇女工作的领导上，对农村中社会主义群众运动的新高潮的到来是缺乏敏感的。因而对合作化群众运动高潮的来临，缺乏应有的思想准备和组织准备，有的同志惟恐妇联在运动高潮中使不上力，不免有些惊慌失措；有的愁着妇女骨干太少，无法配备新社所需的干部，建立不起新社中的妇女工作；有的感到还没有学会办社本领，发愁没法领导妇女群众，因而产生“怕社”、“躲社”的情绪。从这些方面可以看出我们妇联也是领导远远落后于群众的，这种现象必须迅速克服。
    农业合作化运动是一个比土地改革更为复杂、斗争更为尖锐的社会主义革命运动，而且是亿万男女农民已经自觉自愿地行动起来了的革命运动。这个运动不仅全党都要按照毛泽东同志的指示全面规划，加强领导；作为党领导的妇女群众组织，全国妇联和各级妇联，也应该向党保证，赶快清醒头脑，提高认识，集中力量，勇敢地、积极地、脚踏实地地投到运动中去。每个妇女干部都必须学会办社，成为办社的能手；每个妇女干部必须认真学习马克思列宁主义，钻研农业的社会主义改造的各项政策和办社的各种先进经验，使自己成为在党的领导下推行合作化运动的优秀的宣传者和组织者。要深入妇女群众，加强社会主义的政治工作。政治工作必须做得深，做得广，做得透，不怕反复和麻烦地长期做，针对群众的认识水平和思想情况来做。只有发挥了这样的主观努力，才能保证合作化运动健康地胜利地发展。我们不能否认妇女仍然比较落后的事实，正因为如此，在农村中对妇女进行这样的政治宣传工作，就显得更为重要。妇女基层组织就是最好的向妇女群众进行政治工作的组织形式。必须使这一组织形式和合作化发展的形势相适应。因此我们妇联必须在党的领导下，结合发展和整顿合作社，随时整顿妇女基层组织，使它健全、纯洁，能够为推进合作化运动服务。还要在党统一规划培养训练干部积极分子和技术人员的时候，协助党提出培养训练女干部、女积极分子和女技术人员的计划，经过党的批准成为整个规划的一部分。总之，妇联整个农村工作，从思想工作到组织工作，都要紧紧地围绕着合作化运动来进行。
    妇联一定要在党的领导下，率领着亿万妇女群众，成为党完成农业的社会主义改造中的一支巨大力量。要使妇女组织成为这样的一种力量，党加强对妇女组织的领导是决定的关键。为此，我们对各级党委在领导农村妇女工作方面提出以下建议：
    一、各级党委在发动广大农民参加农业合作化运动的时候，必须继续贯彻执行男女一齐发动、一齐教育的方针，社会主义教育要做到家喻户晓，深入人心，就必须对妇女进行更多的教育工作。
    二、妇女的思想觉悟和对待农业合作化的态度，基本上是由她们的阶级地位、经济生活来决定的，因此我们对待妇女群众，也必须正确运用阶级分析的方法，贯彻执行阶级路线。在农业合作化运动中机械地把妇女一律看成“落后”或一律看成可以依靠的力量，都是不对的。
    三、在农业生产合作社的各项具体措施中，保证妇女应得的权益，合理照顾并逐步解决妇女的切身困难。
    四、有意识地培养妇女骨干，参加合作化的领导。特别要注意培养贫农和下中农中的妇女积极分子，做到社社有骨干，乡乡有旗帜。
