Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's Mechanized Supply Station has recently received a new batch of advanced construction machinery. Among these newly arrived machines are giant excavators, bulldozers, and pile drivers for earthwork projects; and a 25-ton crane for factory roof pillar construction and machinery installation. These machines all have high production efficiency. Take the giant universal excavator as an example: it weighs 160 tons and has a bucket capacity of three cubic meters, three times larger than past excavator buckets. Based on its designed capacity, it can excavate more than 2,000 cubic meters of earth per day, equivalent to the labor of 500 workers. In addition, this machine can not only excavate earth but also be used as a crane after modification. Some of these machines are already in operation, and some are actively preparing for test runs. The chief mechanical engineer of Ansteel Construction Company is considering the usage plan for this giant excavator, intending to use it on the construction project of key factory buildings.

    鞍钢新到一批新式建筑机械
    鞍山钢铁建设公司机械化供应站最近又新到了一批新式建筑机械。在这批新到的机械中，有服务于土方工程的巨型挖土机、推土机、打桩机；也有用于进行厂房顶制柱和机械安装的起重二十五吨的起重机。这些机械的生产效率都很大。以巨型万能挖土机为例，它本身重量就达一百六十吨，挖斗容量达三立方公尺，比过去挖土机的挖斗大三倍。根据设计能力，一天可以挖土二千多立方公尺，相当五百个工人一天的劳动。此外，这种机械不仅能挖掘土方，而且经改装以后，还可以当吊车使用。现在这些机械有的已经投入施工，有的正积极准备试车。鞍钢建设公司的总机械师，正在考虑这台巨型挖土机的使用方案，准备用在重点厂房的建厂工程上。　　　　（冯世明）
