　　Evaluating the Quality of Newly Established Cooperatives
　　On November 3rd, in the third district of Wuming County, Guangxi Province, three townships conducted an evaluation of thirty-nine new cooperatives after their establishment work had come to a close.

　　They agreed upon the following evaluation standards: 1. All cooperative members have a clear understanding of the merits of the two paths, firm confidence in joining the cooperative, and everyone is willing; 2. The class policy is well publicized and implemented, the leadership and membership within the cooperative are pure, and the superiority of the poor peasants is established; 3. The "three evaluations" are fair and reasonable, and everyone is satisfied; 4. All leaders and members within the cooperative are united, more than 95% are in high spirits, and production is enthusiastic. Those that meet the standards are considered first-class cooperatives; those that basically meet the standards are considered second-class cooperatives; and those that are far from the standards are considered third-class cooperatives. The evaluation method is to first divide into groups to compare each item with the specific situation of each cooperative, self-report and discuss publicly; then take the township as a unit, and compare township with township.

　　After such an evaluation, everyone had concrete examples, which encouraged the confidence to run the cooperatives better; at the same time, they also found shortcomings in their work and overcame the blind optimism of some staff members.

　  评比新建社的质量
    十一月三日，广西省武鸣县三区有三个乡在三十九个新社的建社工作告一段落的时候，进行了一次评比。
    他们议定了评比的标准：一、全体社员对两条道路好坏认识清楚，入社信心坚定，人人自愿；二、阶级政策宣传和执行得好，社内领导人员和社员成分纯洁，树立了贫农的优势；三、
  “三评”公平合理，人人满意；四、全体社内领导人员和社员互相团结，百分之九十五以上情绪饱满，生产积极。达到标准的就算一类社；基本上达到的算二类社；距离标准较远的算三类社。评比的方法是先分成小组逐条和各社具体情况对照，自报公议；然后以乡为单位，乡同乡比。
    这样评比了以后，大家有了具体的榜样，鼓舞了把社办得更好的信心；同时也找出了工作中的缺点，克服了部分工作人员的盲目乐观情绪。
