    The production work of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Dyeing and Printing Factory is carried out under extremely difficult circumstances. The task of the dyeing and printing factory is to process various types of fabrics from state-owned textile factories. However, the quality of the fabrics sent by many textile factories is very poor and cannot be dyed and printed. The Shanghai State-owned No. 16 Cotton Mill only cares about completing its own tasks and uses the method of "waxing" to overcome the "difficulty" of yarn breakage in the "Worker-Peasant Brand" bad cloth. As a result, this "difficulty" is passed on to the workers of the dyeing and printing factory. Once this batch of bad cloth is processed, the waxed edges cannot be dyed, and this batch of cloth becomes third-class cloth. When the dyeing and printing factory raised this serious issue, the State-owned No. 16 Cotton Mill continued to produce with waxing as usual. Helpless, the No. 1 Dyeing and Printing Factory was forced to stop the production of "Worker-Peasant Brand" blue cloth.
    This is not only the case with this one factory, but similar things have also happened in the State-owned Cotton Mills No. 5, No. 1, No. 6, No. 9, No. 10, and No. 12.
    These tendencies to disregard product quality and "only care about completing one's own tasks, regardless of the life or death of others" must be eliminated. The Shanghai "Liberation Daily" opened a special column on November 2nd called "Mutual Criticism and Suggestions Between Factories and Enterprises," and published articles by the State-owned No. 1 Dyeing and Printing Factory criticizing the aforementioned State-owned No. 16 Cotton Mill and other factories. Advocating this practice of mutual criticism and suggestions between factories and enterprises is a good way to improve production.

### 印染厂灾难的来源

    印染厂灾难的来源
    国营上海第一印染厂的生产工作，是在七灾八难的情况下进行的。印染厂的任务，就是把各国营纺织厂的各类布匹，进行加工。可是，许多纺织厂送来的布匹质量非常低劣，无法印染。上海国棉十六厂只顾自己完成任务，把“工农牌”坏布，用“擦蜡”的办法来克服纱断头的“困难”，结果，这个
  “困难”却推到印染厂的工人头上。这批坏布一经加工，擦蜡的两边颜色染不上，这批布变成了三等次布。当印染厂提出这个严重问题的时候，国棉十六厂还是照旧擦蜡生产。无法，第一印染厂被迫停止“工农牌”蓝布的生产。
    不仅这一个工厂这样，还有国营棉纺五厂、一厂、六厂、九厂、十厂、十二厂也有这类事情发生。
    这些忽视产品质量，“只顾自己完成任务，不管别人死活”的偏向，必须消除。上海“解放日报”十一月二日专辟了一栏，叫“工厂企业间的相互批评和建议”，并且刊登了国营第一印染厂批评前面国营棉纺第十六厂等工厂的文章。提倡这种工厂企业间相互批评和建议的作法，是改进生产的一个好方法。
