The first tugboat to navigate the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the "Pioneer," has successfully completed its trial voyage in Inner Mongolia and is now officially participating in grain transportation on the Yellow River waterway. The "Pioneer" tugboat was manufactured by the Harbin Shipbuilding and Repair Plant. Its carrying capacity is sixteen times greater than that of ordinary wooden boats, and its sailing speed is three times faster. To adapt to the shallow conditions of the upper reaches of the Yellow River, its draft is only 0.7 meters. In previous years, the transportation of grain from the Hetao Administrative Region relied on wooden boats on the Yellow River waterway. This year, the Hetao Administrative Region has had a bumper harvest, and the successfully trial-run "Pioneer" tugboat is transporting this grain outwards. (Our correspondent in Hohhot)

    黄河上游试航拖轮成功
    在黄河上游航行的第一艘拖轮“先锋号”已在内蒙古试航成功，现已正式参加了黄河航道上的粮食运输工作。“先锋号”拖轮是哈尔滨船舶修造厂制造的，它的载重量比普通木船大十六倍，航行速度比普通木船快三倍。为适应黄河上游滩浅情况，吃水量只有零点七公尺。往年，河套行政区的外运粮食都依靠黄河航道上木船运输。今年，河套行政区获得丰收，试航成功的“先锋号”拖轮正载运着这些粮食向外运输。　（本报驻呼和浩特记者）
