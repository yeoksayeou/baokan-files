    Actions Violating the Common Aspirations of the Chinese and Japanese Peoples

    Shortly after the joint communiqué was issued by the head of the Japanese Diet Delegation to China, Sakae Koyama, and the Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Peng Zhen, and just as the Chinese and Japanese peoples were making further efforts to realize the normalization of relations between the two countries, news came that the Japanese government would forcibly send 114 Chinese residing in Hamamatsu to Taiwan on November 4. At the same time, there was also news that the remains of Tang Xuanzang, which Japan had looted from Nanjing during the War of Aggression Against China, would also be sent to Taiwan in the near future. Such actions are clearly incompatible with the common aspirations of the Chinese and Japanese peoples to improve relations between the two countries. The Chinese people cannot but protest against this.

    Both the Chinese and Japanese peoples hope to improve relations between the two countries and demand the promotion of the normalization of diplomatic relations. The Chinese and Japanese peoples also hope to find a friendly solution to the issue of compatriots returning to their countries and the return of the remains of the deceased, and have made many concrete efforts. The Chinese side has assisted approximately 29,000 Japanese nationals in returning to Japan, and has also adopted the lenient measure of sending back to Japan 417 former Japanese soldiers whose crimes during the War of Aggression Against China and the Chinese People's Liberation War were not particularly serious. The Chinese side has also assisted in sending back the ashes of some Japanese who died in China. Japanese people's organizations have also adopted a friendly and cooperative attitude, assisting Chinese residing in Japan to return to their country and returning the remains of Chinese who died in Japan. In the joint communiqué issued on October 17, 1955, by the head of the Japanese Diet Delegation to China, Sakae Koyama, and the Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China, Peng Zhen, in addition to stipulating that China and Japan should actively strive to realize the normalization of diplomatic relations, it was specifically stipulated: "China and Japan should actively take care of the compatriots of both sides so that they can freely travel to and from their respective countries." The communiqué also stipulated: "China and Japan have previously returned the remains of the deceased to each other, and in the future, both sides should continue to return the remains of the deceased to their respective countries as soon as possible." It is heard that the Red Cross Society of China will soon take concrete measures in this regard.

    However, the Japanese government has taken the opposite attitude, not only detaining a large number of Chinese residing in Japan but also forcibly sending them to Taiwan. The Japanese government has also condoned the transfer of the remains of Xuanzang, looted from China, to Taiwan. Thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese side and Japanese people's organizations, the issue of Japanese nationals returning to China has been resolved. The Chinese government has also stated that if any Japanese nationals currently in China apply to return to their country, the Chinese government will still provide various facilities to enable them to realize their wishes. However, as pointed out in the statement of the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman on August 16: "China has tens of thousands of compatriots residing in Japan, whose legitimate rights and interests have not been properly taken care of. Their ties with their motherland and families are still obstructed, and they do not have the convenience of returning home." The Japanese government's action of forcibly sending Chinese residents to Taiwan further proves that on the issue of compatriots residing in China and Japan, what needs to be resolved through negotiation is not the issue of Japanese nationals, but the issue of Chinese nationals.

    We believe that these actions, which violate the common aspirations of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, will not only arouse the indignation of the Chinese people but also the dissatisfaction of the Japanese people. Japanese people's organizations and Japanese Diet members who are willing to be friendly with China have a responsibility to demand clarification and correction of this.

### 违反中日两国人民共同愿望的行动

    违反中日两国人民共同愿望的行动
    正当日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉同中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真发表联合公报后不久，中日两国人民正在为实现两国邦交正常化作进一步努力的时候，却有消息说，日本政府将在十一月四日把被拘留在滨松的一百十四名华侨强制送到台湾。同时，还有消息说，日本在侵华战争期间从南京劫去的唐玄奘遗骨也将在最近期间送往台湾。这种行动同中日两国人民改进两国关系的共同愿望显然是不相调和的。中国人民对此不能不提出抗议。
    中日两国人民都希望改进两国之间的关系，要求促进两国邦交的正常化。中日两国人民对于两国侨民回国和送还死亡者遗骨的问题，也都希望求得友好的解决并且作了许多具体的努力。中国方面已经协助了约二万九千名日侨返回日本，对四百十七名在日本侵华战争和中国人民解放战争中罪行不甚严重的前日本军人，也采取了送回日本的宽大措施。中国方面并且曾经协助送还在中国死亡的一部分日本人的骨灰。日本人民团体也采取了友好合作的态度，曾经协助华侨回国并且送还死亡在日本的中国人的遗骨。一九五五年十月十七日，日本国会议员访华团团长上林山荣吉同中国全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长彭真共同发表的联合公报中，除规定中日两国应该为实现邦交的正常化积极努力外，并具体规定：“中日两国应该积极地照顾双方侨民，使他们能够自由地来往本国。”公报中还规定：“中日间过去曾经互相送还过死亡者的遗骨，今后双方应该继续把双方死亡者的遗骨尽速地送还其本国。”据闻中国红十字会总会即将对此采取具体措施。
    但是，日本政府却采取了相反的态度，不仅拘留了大批在日华侨，而且将把他们强制送到台湾。日本政府还纵容把从中国劫去的玄奘遗骨送交台湾。由于中国方面同日本人民团体的共同努力，在华日侨回国问题已经获得了解决。中国政府并且已经表示，如果现在在华的日侨中有人申请回国，中国政府仍将给予各种便利，使他们能够实现自己的愿望。但是，正如中国外交部发言人在八月十六日的声明中所指出：“中国在日本有数万侨民，他们的正当权益并未得到应有的照顾。他们同祖国和家庭的联系还受到阻挠，他们更没有回国的便利。”日本政府把华侨强制送到台湾去的行动，更加证实在中日两国侨民问题上，应该谈判解决的并不是日本侨民问题，倒是中国侨民问题。
    我们相信，这种种违反中日两国人民共同愿望的行动不仅引起中国人民的愤慨，而且也将引起日本人民的不满。愿意同中国友好的日本人民团体和日本议员们有责任对此要求澄清并且加以纠正。
