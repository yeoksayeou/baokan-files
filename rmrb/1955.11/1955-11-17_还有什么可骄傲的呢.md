What Else Is There to Be Proud Of?

    Anshan Iron and Steel Company has not earnestly studied the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and fraternal factories and mines.
    Spraying tar in open-hearth furnaces is an advanced Soviet technique for increasing steel production in recent years. A year ago, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works raised a technical measure plan requesting the installation of permanent tar spraying equipment, but it has not been installed to this day. A year ago, Soviet experts proposed adding manganese outside the steelmaking furnace. After Chongqing's steel plant implemented this in July of this year, it saved a large amount of manganese, reduced costs, and can produce an additional 1,500 tons of steel per year. However, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works did not begin implementing it until October of this year. Due to the failure to adopt this experience early, it is estimated that at least 10,000 tons of steel will be lost annually. When smelting heavy rail steel, the advanced Soviet experience of using ferromanganese inside the furnace and silicomanganese after the furnace was only tried for a week by the steelmaking plant before being stopped. The blooming mill, the second sheet mill, and the medium-sized rolling mill in the rolling system also failed to thoroughly implement the suggestions made by Soviet experts, resulting in frequent equipment accidents and great losses to the country.
    Anshan Iron and Steel Company's factories and mines have also poorly learned the advanced experiences of fraternal factories and mines. For example, the ironmaking plant has not well studied the experiences of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Benxi Iron and Steel Plant in increasing the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and reducing the coke ratio; the steelmaking plant does not learn from the experiences of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and other units in improving the quality of cast steel.
    According to the inspection by leading staff members of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the fundamental reason for not seriously studying the advanced experiences of the Soviet Union and fraternal factories and mines is that some leading personnel have complacency and arrogance. But since they have already fallen behind, what else is there to be proud of or complacent about? Now is the time to truly learn humbly, be aggressive, and catch up quickly!

    还有什么可骄傲的呢
    鞍山钢铁公司没有切实学习苏联的和兄弟厂矿的先进经验。
    在平炉内喷焦油，是苏联近几年来增加钢产量的先进技术。一年前，鞍钢炼钢厂就提出技术措施计划，要求安装永久性的喷焦油设备，到现在还没安装。一年前，苏联专家就提出在炼钢炉外加锰的建议，重庆的炼钢厂在今年七月份实行以后，节约了大量的锰，降低了成本，一年还可以多生产一千五百吨钢。但是，鞍钢炼钢厂到今年十月份才开始实行，由于没有及早地采用这一经验，估计一年至少少生产一万吨钢。冶炼重轨钢的时候，在苏联，是炉内锰铁，炉后加矽铁，这个先进经验，炼钢厂仅试用一星期就停止了。轧钢系统的初轧厂、第二薄板厂、中型轧钢厂也没有很好贯彻实现苏联专家提出的建议，因而经常发生设备事故，给国家造成了很大的损失。
    对兄弟厂矿的先进经验，鞍钢各厂矿学习得也很差。如炼铁厂没有很好学习石景山钢铁厂和本溪钢铁厂的提高高炉利用系数、降低焦炭比的经验；炼钢厂不学习太原钢铁厂等单位改进铸钢质量的经验。
    据鞍山钢铁公司的领导工作人员检查，没有认真学习苏联的和兄弟厂矿的先进经验的根本原因，是有些领导人员有骄傲自满情绪。但是既然已经落在人家后面，还有什么可骄傲，可自满的呢？现在应该是真正地虚心进取急起直追的时候了！
