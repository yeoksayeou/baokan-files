Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, November 26th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China convened its first district committee secretary meeting from November 10th to 23rd. More than 1,700 people attended the meeting, including district committee secretaries, outstanding agricultural production cooperative directors, and cadres stationed in the cooperatives. The meeting fully discussed the issue of consolidating cooperatives. Since Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" were issued, Guangdong Province's cooperativization movement has been vigorous and rapidly developing over the past two months. The number of cooperatives has increased from the original 15,000 to 50,000, and another 50,000 cooperatives have already been framed up and can be established after the autumn harvest. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has increased from 6.7% of the total number of peasant households to 40%. According to the plan finally revised by the Provincial Party Committee, as long as these 100,000 cooperatives are consolidated, each cooperative will be expanded by another 10 households next year. At the same time, 50,000 new cooperatives will be established. By the end of next year, the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives will reach about 80% of the total number of peasant households, basically realizing the semi-socialist cooperativization of agriculture in the province. At the meeting, Comrade Tao Zhu, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, delivered a summary report on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee. He particularly emphasized the need to rely on the superiority of the cooperatives to develop agricultural production, and demanded that grain production be increased by 4.3 billion jin in the next two years in order to achieve the task of increasing agricultural production by 42% during the First Five-Year Plan. On this basis, efforts should be made to achieve the goal of an average grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu throughout the province by 1967.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, November 26th: Jiangsu Province will basically achieve semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization by 1956.

Jiangsu Province's agricultural production cooperatives have developed to more than 140,000 during the first high tide of cooperativization this autumn, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has accounted for more than half of the total number of peasant households in the province. At the beginning of November, a mass movement to consolidate cooperatives was formed throughout the province. At present, most of the more than 110,000 new cooperatives established in the autumn have improved their organizational structure, adjusted their labor organization, established production order, and handled specific issues such as draught cattle and production investment in accordance with the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Among these cooperatives, some have already formulated short-term production plans, seasonal plans, and annual plans for next year, and have entered winter production. The more than 35,000 old cooperatives established before the autumn have also further improved their management through autumn distribution and production summaries in the cooperative consolidation movement. The vast majority of cooperatives are in the process of making or have already made production plans. All the old cooperatives generally increased production this year compared with the surrounding farmers, setting an example for the farmers.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out at an enlarged meeting of the Provincial Party Committee attended by local committee secretaries on the 21st that as long as the party organizations and party members throughout Jiangsu Province earnestly follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively, enthusiastically, and systematically lead the movement, mobilize the existing agricultural production cooperatives to seize the production in this winter and next spring, carry out continuous rectification and improvement work, strive for a bumper summer harvest next year, and make ideological, organizational, and material preparations for development in a planned way next summer, make overall plans, strengthen leadership, and have another major development next autumn, so that the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives will reach 75% to 85% of the total number of peasant households in the province, it is entirely possible to basically realize semi-socialist agricultural cooperativization throughout the province.

　　广东江苏明年将基本实现农业合作化
    本报广州二十六日电　中国共产党广东省委员会从十一月十日至二十三日召开了第一次区委书记会议。参加会议的有区委书记、出色的农业生产合作社主任和驻社干部等一千七百多人。这次会议充分地讨论了巩固合作社问题。自从毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示下达以后，两个多月来广东省的合作化运动是声势浩大、发展迅速的，合作社的数量已由原有的一万五千多个发展到五万个，还有五万个社已经搭好架子，秋收后即可建成，入社农户已由占农户总数的百分之六点七增加到占农户总数的百分之四十。根据省委最后修订的规划，只要把这十万个社巩固好，明年每社再扩大十户，同时新建五万个社，到明年年底全省入社的农户就能达到农户总数的百分之八十左右，基本上实现全省农业的半社会主义合作化。在会议上省委书记陶铸同志代表省委作了总结报告。他特别强调要依靠合作社的优越性来发展农业生产，要求今后两年内增产粮食四十三亿斤，以便实现第一个五年计划农业增产百分之四十二的任务，并且在此基础上争取在一九六七年实现全省粮食产量达到每亩平均一千斤的目标。
    新华社南京二十六日电　江苏省到一九五六年将基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化。
    江苏省农业生产合作社在今年秋季的第一个合作化新高潮中已经发展到十四万多个，入社农户已经占到全省农户总数的一半以上。十一月初，全省就形成了群众性的整社运动。目前在秋季建立的十一万多个新社，大部分都健全了组织机构，调整了劳动组织，建立了生产秩序，并且按照自愿互利原则处理了耕牛和生产投资等具体问题。在这些社中，有的已经订立小段生产计划、季节计划和明年的全年计划，进入了冬季生产。在秋季以前建立的三万五千多个老社，在整社运动中也都通过秋季分配和总结生产，进一步改善了经营管理。绝大部分的社正在做或者已经做好了生产规划。所有老社今年普遍比周围农民增产，又给农民树立了榜样。
    中共江苏省委员会在二十一日召开的有各地委书记参加的省委扩大会议上指出，只要江苏全省党的组织和党员切实地遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，积极地热情地有计划地领导运动，发动现有农业生产合作社抓紧今冬明春的生产，进行不断的整顿提高工作，争取明年夏熟丰收，在明年夏季再有计划地做好发展的思想准备、组织准备和物质准备工作，全面规划，加强领导，明年秋季再一个大发展，入社农户达到全省农户百分之七十五到八十五，在全省基本上实现半社会主义的农业合作化，是完全可以做到的。
