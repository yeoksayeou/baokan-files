What Was Learned from This International Friendship Shooting Competition
Ji He, Head of the Chinese Shooting Delegation

Shooting is an interesting and very meaningful sport. Widely developing shooting sports is of great significance for consolidating national defense, enhancing the people's physical fitness, and cultivating the strong will of athletes.

In our country, it was only after the founding of the People's Republic of China that the widespread development of shooting sports became possible. The reactionary ruling class of old China not only did not care about developing shooting sports among the people, but they were also afraid of the people mastering shooting techniques.

The Party and the government pay great attention to the widespread development of shooting sports among the people. In recent years, the Central National Defense Sports Club has done a lot of work in developing shooting sports, and shooting sports in some city organs, schools, and factories have also been developed. However, from a general perspective, we still lack experience in developing shooting sports. Therefore, we attach great importance to this international friendship shooting competition held in China. Mutual exchange of experience and mutual learning through the competition will be a great driving force for our future widespread development of shooting sports.

The young shooters of the Chinese shooting delegation feel very honored to be able to participate in this friendship shooting competition together with outstanding shooting athletes from various fraternal countries. Our shooters have not been engaged in shooting sports for a long time, and they are insufficient in terms of both shooting technical level and competition experience. Therefore, we regard this competition as a good learning opportunity, and each athlete participates in this competition with a humble attitude of learning.

In the short few days since the competition began, we have already learned a lot from athletes from various countries. Chinese athletes have observed the shooting actions of outstanding athletes from various countries in great detail, and found that many athletes maintain consistent shooting postures, thus achieving excellent results. Soviet master athlete Comrade Kolmushkina was able to achieve an excellent result of hitting 599 rings out of 60 shots in the 50-meter and 100-meter prone shooting, one of the very important reasons is that she paid attention to maintaining a certain shooting posture. It is also very important to correctly grasp the time in shooting competitions, because there are strict time limits for shooting in each event, ranging from a few seconds to several hours. Fully utilizing and allocating this time is an indispensable condition for striving for victory. In this regard, Chinese shooters still have many shortcomings. For example, some shooters are slower at the beginning of shooting, so that in the later stage there is insufficient time, and they have to speed up, so they cannot perform more accurate aiming and confident shooting, which affects the shooting results. We have seen that many athletes from fraternal countries are worth learning from in mastering time. They can perform faster shooting when the meteorological conditions are normal and the shooting is smooth, and take appropriate rest when shooting under difficult conditions, so as to shoot with more confidence.

This competition also showed that our shooters still lack competition experience. Some shooters have good usual results, but in the competition, they show nervousness and cannot shoot calmly, which significantly reduces their shooting results. The reason why the shooters of our team missed two shots in this small-caliber pistol silhouette target rapid-fire was due to lack of experience. When the first shooter was shooting, in order to strive for a higher number of rings, he exceeded the shooting time and missed one shot. Seeing that the first shooter missed a shot, the third shooter became over-nervous and also missed a shot. Although the number of rings in the pistol rapid-fire of the Czechoslovak delegation was not high, they won the second place because they mastered the method of focusing on hitting the target.

This competition is a friendship competition, and the internationalist spirit of unity and mutual assistance among athletes demonstrates the characteristics of this competition. Athletes from various countries introduce their successful experiences without reservation and enthusiastically help others as if they were helping their own brothers and sisters. There is no jealousy or disputes here; there is only friendship and unity. Because everyone recognizes that we have common aspirations and are taking a common path.

The athletes of the Chinese delegation have been exercised in this competition and enriched our knowledge and experience. This should be thanks to the help of athletes from various countries, especially the help of the Soviet delegation. This friendly mutual assistance will further enhance our unity.

　　在这次国际友谊射击竞赛中学到了什么
　　中国射击代表团团长　吉合
    射击是一种富有兴趣而又十分有意义的运动。广泛地开展射击运动，对巩固国防，增强人民体质，培养运动员的坚强意志都有重要的意义。
    在我国，只有在中华人民共和国成立之后，广泛地开展射击运动才成为可能。旧中国的反动统治阶级不仅不会关心在人民群众中开展射击运动，而且他们还害怕人民掌握射击技术。
    党和政府十分注意在人民群众中广泛地开展射击运动。近年来，中央国防体育俱乐部在开展射击运动方面做了很多工作，有些城市的机关、学校和工厂的射击运动也已经开展起来，但是，从总的方面来看，我们对开展射击运动的工作还缺乏经验。因此我们十分重视这次在中国举行的国际友谊射击竞赛，通过竞赛能够互相交流经验、互相学习，对我们今后广泛开展射击运动是一个很大的推动力量。
    年青的中国射击代表团的射手们能够和各兄弟国家的优秀射击运动员共同参加这次友谊射击竞赛感到十分光荣。我们的射手从事射击运动历史不长，不论在射击技术水平和竞赛经验方面都是不足的。因此，我们把这次竞赛看成是一个良好的学习机会，每个运动员都抱着虚心学习的态度，来参加这次竞赛。
    从竞赛以来短短几天中，我们已经从各国运动员那里学习到很多的东西。中国运动员十分详细地观察了各国优秀运动员的射击动作，发现很多运动员射击姿势始终一致，因而获得了优异的成绩。苏联运动健将科尔穆什金娜同志在五十公尺和一百公尺卧射六十发子弹中，能够达到命中五百九十九环的优秀成绩，其中一个十分重要的原因，就是由于她注意保持一定的射击姿势。在射击竞赛中正确地掌握时间也是十分重要的，因为每个项目的射击都有严格的时间限制，短则数秒，长则数小时，充分地利用和分配这些时间是争取胜利所不可缺少的条件。在这一方面，中国的射手还有很多缺点，例如有的射手在起初射击时，速度较慢，以致在后一阶段中时间不足，不得不加快速度，因而不能进行更精确的瞄准和有把握的射击，使射击成绩受到影响。我们看到兄弟国家的许多运动员在掌握时间上是值得我们学习的。他们能在气象条件正常，射击顺利的时候进行较快的射击，而在困难条件下射击的时候，则适当进行休息，以便在更有把握的情况下进行射击。
    在这次竞赛中也表现出我们射手还缺乏竞赛经验，有些射手的平时成绩很好，但是在竞赛的场合下，却表现精神紧张，不能沉着地进行发射，以致使射击成绩显著下降。这次小口径手枪人像靶的速射，我国代表队的射手所以脱靶两发，就是由于缺乏经验所致。在第一名射手射击的时候，为了争取更高的环数，超过了射击时间而脱靶一发，第三名射手见第一名射手脱靶，精神上过度紧张也脱靶一发。捷克斯洛伐克代表队手枪速射的环数虽然不高，但是由于他们掌握了以命中目标为主的方法，因而获得第二名。
    这次竞赛是一场友谊的竞赛，运动员之间团结互助的国际主义精神表现出这次竞赛的特点。各国运动员毫无保留地介绍自己的成功经验，热心地帮助别人就像帮助自己的兄弟姊妹一样。这里没有妒忌和纠纷；这里有的是友谊和团结。因为大家都认识到：我们有共同的愿望；走的是共同的道路。
    中国代表团的运动员在这次竞赛中得到一次锻炼，丰富了我们的知识和经验，这应该感谢各国运动员对我们的帮助，特别是苏联代表团对我们的帮助，这种友谊的互助将进一步增进我们的团结。
