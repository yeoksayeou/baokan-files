Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch: The ranks of the Chinese Communist Party in rural areas have greatly developed over the past year. At the end of June 1954, only 70 percent of townships nationwide had established CCP branches; now, more than 90 percent of townships nationwide have established CCP branches. In the first half of 1955, more than 485,000 activists in the agricultural cooperativization movement joined the Chinese Communist Party in rural areas nationwide.

The development and strengthening of CCP rural organizations have greatly enhanced the core strength of the agricultural cooperativization movement. More than 92 percent of the 318 agricultural production cooperatives established this year in Yanhe County, Guizhou Province, were established under the specific leadership of CCP rural branches. In Wuchuan, Zunyi, and other counties, 85 percent of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives quickly began production activities and were consolidated because of the participation of Communist Party members in leadership. The 196 agricultural production cooperatives established this autumn in Chihe District, Dingyuan County, Anhui Province, were all established relying on the strength of CCP rural branches. In Xuanji Township, Siyang County, Jiangsu Province, because new and old Communist Party members promoted farmers' joining cooperatives through their actions of actively participating in and leading agricultural production cooperatives, the township recently developed from four agricultural production cooperatives to twenty-six agricultural production cooperatives. Chen Xiuhe, a Communist Party member in Dalin District, Qiongshan County, Guangdong Province, who recently joined the Party, had been rated as a township model four times in a row since the land reform. Not long ago, he painstakingly and thoroughly mobilized nine poor peasant households to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, enabling the number of farmers in the village participating in agricultural production cooperatives to exceed the original plan by 43 percent. Aimaiti Mamuti, a new Party member in Xiaokaohu Township, Shufu County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, persuaded his father to contribute ten mu of alfalfa land to the cooperative, and then motivated three households including Awuti to contribute seven mu of alfalfa land to the cooperative.

Currently, CCP rural organizations at all levels are formulating plans to develop new Party members in rural areas in the future, in conjunction with the overall planning work of agricultural cooperativization. In the great development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, CCP rural grassroots organizations are continuing to recruit large numbers of peasant activists who meet the requirements for Party membership into the ranks of the Party.

　　中国共产党农村组织有很大发展
　　农业合作化运动的核心力量大大增强
    新华社二十一日讯　中国共产党在农村中的队伍一年来又有很大的发展。在一九五四年六月底的时候，全国还只有百分之七十的乡建立中共支部；现在，全国百分之九十以上的乡都建立了中共支部。在一九五五年上半年，全国农村中有四十八万五千多个农业合作化运动中的积极分子参加了中国共产党。
    中共农村组织的发展壮大，大大增强了农业合作化运动的核心力量。贵州省沿河县今年建立的三百一十八个农业生产合作社，有百分之九十二以上是在中共农村支部的具体领导下建立起来的。婺川、遵义等县百分之八十五的新建立的农业生产合作社因为有共产党员参加领导，很快就展开生产活动，得到了巩固。安徽省定远县池河区今年秋天建立的一百九十六个农业生产合作社，都是依靠中共农村支部的力量建立起来的。江苏省泗阳县宣集乡由于新、老共产党员都以积极参加和领导农业生产合作社的行动推动农民入社，全乡最近由四个农业生产合作社发展到二十六个农业生产合作社。最近入党的广东省琼山县大林区的共产党员陈秀和，从土地改革以来曾经连续四次被评为乡的模范，不久以前他又艰苦深入地发动了九户贫农参加农业生产合作社，使全村参加农业生产合作社的农民超过了原计划百分之四十三。新疆维吾尔自治区疏附县肖考胡乡新党员艾买提麻木提说服父亲把十亩苜蓿地入社以后，带动阿吾提等三户农民也把七亩苜蓿地入了社。
    现在，中共各级农村组织正在结合农业合作化的全面规划工作，制定今后在农村中发展新党员的计划。各地的中共农村基层组织在农业合作化运动的大发展中，还在继续把大批有入党条件的农民积极分子接收到党的队伍中来。
