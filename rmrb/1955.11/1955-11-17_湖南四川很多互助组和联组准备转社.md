　　Many Mutual Aid Teams and Joint Teams in Hunan and Sichuan are Preparing to Transition to Cooperatives
　　In Hunan Province, over 500,000 mutual aid teams are actively creating conditions to transition into cooperatives. Preliminary statistics indicate that 50,000 permanent mutual aid teams across the province already meet the requirements for transition and have been identified as transition targets by the leadership organs of various districts and townships. After the issuance of Chairman Mao's instructions "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," the enthusiasm of the team members for establishing cooperatives has been further inspired. They are uniting with over 100,000 surrounding mutual aid teams and individual farmers to automatically form joint teams, study the relevant policies of agricultural cooperatives, and further create conditions to welcome the establishment of cooperatives. Baiyu Township in Pingjiang County has a total of 45 mutual aid teams, of which 40 automatically merged after the autumn harvest. Among them, the Yu Nongzhang mutual aid team, which previously lacked draft cattle, recently specifically purchased draft cattle in preparation for transitioning into a cooperative.
　　Since implementing the policy of comprehensive planning and strengthening leadership, local Party branches have also been paying great attention to cultivating and improving mutual aid teams. The Lianhu Township Party branch in Wangcheng County has identified 11 out of 29 mutual aid teams in the township as targets for establishing cooperatives and four teams as targets for expanding cooperatives. They are now actively cultivating key personnel, developing Party and Youth League members, conducting political and ideological education for team members, and strengthening the leadership of these 15 mutual aid teams.

　　Xinhua News Agency. Tens of thousands of mutual aid joint teams in rural Sichuan Province, who are preparing to build cooperatives, recently put forward the slogan "Do a good job in production and welcome the establishment of cooperatives." Production is proceeding enthusiastically in many areas. In the Nanchong area, more than 300,000 farmers are building small-scale water conservancy projects; the 2,900 mountain ponds originally planned to be completed before the spring plowing next year have now been completed ahead of schedule. In Tongliang County, 52 villages preparing to build cooperatives have accumulated more than 11 million catties of fertilizer in less than a month. Farmers in Shangyi Township, Meishan County, who are preparing to run cooperatives, have added 36 new cattle and 419 pigs.
　　In order to welcome the establishment of cooperatives, many farmers are actively adopting advanced farming techniques and carrying out production in accordance with national plans. In Kongming Township, Qionglai County, there are more than 1,100 mu of wheat land, and in the past few people used the method of strip planting and dense planting. Recently, most of the poor and lower-middle peasants in this township who requested to set up cooperatives decided to implement strip planting and dense planting on more than 700 mu of wheat land.

　　湖南四川很多互助组和联组准备转社
    湖南省有五十多万个互助组正在积极创造条件，准备转社。据初步统计，全省已有五万个常年互助组具备了转社条件，已被各区、乡领导机关确定为转社对象。毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的指示下达后，更鼓舞了广大组员办社的热情，他们正在联合周围十万多个互助组和个体农民，自动成立联组、学习农业合作社的有关政策，进一步创造条件，迎接建社。平江县白雨乡共有四十五个互助组，其中有四十个互助组在秋后就自动并组，其中余弄章互助组过去一直没有耕牛，最近特地买了耕牛，准备转社。
    各地党支部在贯彻执行全面规划、加强领导的方针以后，目前也十分重视对互助组的培养和提高。望城县联湖乡党支部在全乡二十九个互助组中，已确定十一个组为建社对象，四个组为扩社对象，现在正积极培养骨干，发展党团员，对组员进行政治思想教育，加强这十五个互助组的领导。

    四川省农村中成千上万准备建社的互助联组，最近提出了“搞好生产，迎接办社”的行动口号。许多地区的生产正在热火朝天地进行。南充专区有三十多万农民在兴修小型水利；原计划到明年春耕前修成的两千九百口山弯塘，现在已提前完工。铜梁县五十二个准备建社的村子，在不到一个月的时间内，积肥一千一百万斤以上。眉山县尚义乡准备办社的农民新添耕牛三十六头，猪四百一十九口。
    为了迎接办社，许多农民积极采用先进的耕作技术，按国家计划进行生产。邛崃县孔明乡有一千一百多亩小麦地，过去很少有人采用条播密植的方法。最近这个乡要求办社的大部分贫农和下中农，决定在七百多亩的小麦地上实行条播密植。　（新华社）
