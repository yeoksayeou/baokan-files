    Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau Trains a Group of Young Divers
    The Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge Engineering Bureau's Workers' Technical School has trained a group of new young diving technicians.
    These new divers were carpenters, riveters, riggers, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army just a few months ago. In the three months of their studies at the school, in order to quickly master the technology and participate in the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge, they overcame various difficulties, persisted in their studies, and, with the patient help of experienced masters and veteran divers, they basically mastered diving knowledge in a short period of time and reached the standards of a fifth-grade diver. Now they are actively participating in the underwater construction projects of the Yangtze River Bridge construction site.

    长江大桥工程局培养出一批青年潜水员
    武汉长江大桥工程局职工技术学校培养出一批新的青年潜水技术工人。
    这批新的潜水员在几个月前还是木工、铆工、装吊工和解放军的战士。他们在学校学习的三个月中，为了迅速掌握技术，参加长江大桥的建设，曾经克服了各种困难，坚持学习，在老师傅和老潜水员的耐心帮助下，在短期中就基本掌握了潜水知识，达到五级潜水工的标准。现在他们正积极参加长江大桥工地的水下施工工程。（戴全海）
