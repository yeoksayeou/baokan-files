Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 14th - The Indonesian Parliament is scheduled to hold a vote of confidence on the evening of November 15th to decide whether the Harahap cabinet will continue to remain in office. The Indonesian Nationalist Party (PNI) formally announced on the 14th that it does not have confidence in the current cabinet. A statement issued by Mangunsarkoro, Acting Chairman of the PNI, and Lasjad, Secretary-General, said that the Indonesian Nationalist Party believes that the Harahap cabinet can no longer be regarded as an ordinary cabinet after September 29, 1955. It should have restrained itself long ago, limiting itself to carrying out work that is still in progress. After criticizing the Harahap cabinet's policies in various aspects, the statement said, "The Indonesian Nationalist Party cannot express confidence in the Harahap cabinet." The statement said that the PNI made this decision after carefully studying the current political situation. It noted that the current cabinet does not reflect the current social trends indicated by the preliminary results of the parliamentary elections. The statement pointed out that the current cabinet continues to maintain its attitude, regardless of the will of the people, and has adopted principled measures in economic, financial, diplomatic, government personnel, and transportation policies. These measures "exceed the normal rights of the cabinet and violate the principles of parliamentary democracy."

Earlier last week, Asing, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Indonesian Islamic Teachers Association, told Parliament that his party's attitude towards the current cabinet would depend on the government's response regarding the date of the establishment of the new parliament.

　　印度尼西亚国民党宣布不信任现任内阁
    国会即将举行信任投票决定哈拉哈普内阁是否留任
    新华社雅加达十四日电　印度尼西亚国会订于十一月十五日晚间举行信任投票，决定哈拉哈普内阁是否将继续留任。印度尼西亚国民党十四日正式宣布它不能信任现任内阁。国民党代理主席曼贡萨科罗和总书记拉斯雅德发表的一个声明说，印度尼西亚国民党认为哈拉哈普内阁在一九五五年九月二十九日以后已经不能再被认为是一个普通的内阁，它早已应当克制自己，仅限于执行仍然在进行中的工作。声明在批评了哈拉哈普内阁在各方面的政策以后说，“印度尼西亚国民党对于哈拉哈普内阁不能表示信任。”声明说，国民党是在对目前的政治局势进行了认真研究以后作出这个决定的，它注意到现内阁不能反映国会选举临时结果所表明的目前的社会趋势。声明指出，现内阁不顾人民的意志继续保持它的态度。并且在经济、财政、外交、政府人事和交通运输各方面的政策上采取了原则性的措施。这些措施“越过了内阁的正常权利，违反了议会民主的原则”。
    在上星期初，印度尼西亚回教师联合会国会议员团主席阿辛告诉国会说，他的党对现内阁的态度将看政府关于新国会成立的日期的答复而定。
