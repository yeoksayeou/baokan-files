Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 3rd: The Foreign Ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States held their fifth meeting on November 2nd, chaired by Pinay. The Foreign Ministers continued to discuss the first item on the agenda – European security and the German question.

First to speak was Macmillan. He believed that the draft European security treaty proposed by Molotov at the previous meeting covered almost all the issues contained in the Western countries' proposals for guaranteeing security, indicating that some progress had been made. He went on to point out that there were significant differences between the two plans submitted for discussion. Namely, the Western countries' proposal took the reunification of Germany as its basic precondition, while the Soviet proposal "seemed to ignore this task and was based on the division of Germany." Macmillan also said that the Western countries did not believe that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union threatened European security. He believed that the Soviet Union's new plan was a step forward compared to previous plans, because the Soviet delegation now seemed to agree to postpone indefinitely the demand for the dissolution of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

Macmillan said that the Western countries were willing to discuss the clauses in this draft treaty or any new treaty regarding guarantee issues and mutual consultation issues. However, the Western countries could not adopt any other view on this issue except to maintain that Germany must be unified.

Macmillan finally stated that if the Soviet delegation did not put forward proposals regarding the reunification of Germany, the discussion of the first issue would not be fruitful.

Subsequently, Dulles and Pinay expressed their opinions on Molotov's speech on European security and the draft European security treaty he had proposed.

Dulles said that the discussion of the first part of the first item on the agenda, namely the issue of security, has brought our positions much closer. If we can achieve such success in the other part of this agenda, then we will not disappoint the expectations of the world for this meeting.

Dulles said that comparing the proposals of both sides, it could be concluded that there was a "considerable degree of similarity in ideas" between the Western delegations and the Soviet delegation, although the wording of the proposals was not always the same.

Dulles went on to say that, thanks to the constructive consideration of both sides, there was now a real prospect of establishing European security through the conclusion of a security treaty. However, the meeting had not yet achieved any success on the second part of the first item on the agenda, namely the question of the unification of Germany. He believed it was important and urgent for the Soviet Union to put forward its own proposal for a unified Germany. He said that progress could not be made in the discussion of European security until the West understood the Soviet views on "restoring German unity through free elections."

Pinay also said that the Soviet Union must put forward proposals on the German question so that the meeting could continue to work.

Pinay believed that the European security treaty proposed by the Soviet Union had fully taken into account the view of the three Western countries: they could never agree to the Soviet security agreement being based on the abolition of the Atlantic Group and the Western European Union.

Pinay then expressed satisfaction with Molotov's statement that the Western countries' proposal on limiting and supervising troops and armaments was worthy of attention.

Pinay pointed out that the major difference between the positions of the Western countries and the Soviet Union was that the Soviet Union believed that the Federal Republic of Germany and East Germany should participate in the security system, while the Western countries could not agree to European security not being based on the reunification of Germany.

After Pinay's speech, Molotov spoke on the issues of European security and Germany (see page 3) and submitted the Soviet government's proposal for the establishment of an All-German Committee for discussion at the meeting.

Dulles then spoke. He said that he would study the full text of the Soviet delegation's statement very carefully. He said that it was possible to reach an agreement on security issues as long as we reached an agreement on the unification of Germany. Dulles said that the Soviet proposal on the establishment of an All-German Committee discouraged him somewhat, because this proposal was not only impractical, but also a clear departure from the instructions of the heads of government. He hoped that after the meeting discussed the issue of restoring German unity, the Soviet delegation could put forward a proposal that more fully reflected the instructions of the four heads of government and gave more consideration to the views of the three Western countries.

Dulles added that he hoped the Soviet delegation would put forward its own proposals on the issue of holding free elections in Germany, or agree to the Western countries' proposals.

Pinay first stated that he had not yet had time to carefully study the proposal put forward by the Soviet delegation, and then expressed his opinion on Molotov's speech. He said that the Western countries' proposal did not mean to guarantee that the entry of West Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was a condition for the treaty to take effect. He insisted that the purpose of the Soviet proposal was to impose economic, social and political systems of a certain nature on the German people, while the Western countries were only striving to end the instability in Europe by eliminating the division of Germany.

Macmillan then spoke. He said that he would seriously study the Soviet proposal. He said that the reunification of Germany should not be based on consultations between the two German states, but should be achieved through free elections. He said that the central issue was to establish an independent and unified Germany that could freely decide its own foreign policy and domestic policy issues. Germany should be able to decide for itself which alliances and leagues it wishes to join.

Macmillan finally expressed the hope that the Soviet delegation would move closer to the positions of the Western countries on the issue of German reunification, as well as on the issues of free elections and the establishment of an independent German government, so that a complete agreement could be reached.

Molotov then spoke, saying: Due to lack of time, it is not possible to seriously discuss the Soviet delegation's speech at today's meeting, but the Soviet delegation noted the expressions of the U.S., French, and British delegations regarding their willingness to study the Soviet proposal.

Molotov said that we are in favor of holding all-German elections. But there are all kinds of elections, for example, there have been such all-German elections, as a result of which the power of the parliament gradually fell into the hands of Hitler, who then launched the Second World War.

Molotov said that the four governments have all undertaken obligations, in order to ensure European security and ensure that Germany becomes a peaceful and democratic country, so that Germany will no longer fall into the hands of those forces that may provoke a new war in Europe and in the world. The instructions made by the heads of the four governments on the German question proceed precisely from this point of view. The instructions point out that the resolution of the German question and the work of reunifying Germany through free elections should be carried out in a way that conforms to the national interests of the German people and the interests of European security. Molotov pointed out that Dulles, Macmillan, and Pinay all avoided talking about this.

Molotov went on to say that it was particularly strange that the three Western delegations did not talk at all about the Soviet delegation's proposal on promoting the rapprochement of the two Germanys and establishing all-German institutions. Molotov pointed out that there was no reason for the meeting not to come closer on such a question that would serve as a first step in preparing for the real unification of Germany, and that there was no reason to be afraid of hearing the speeches of the representatives of the German people at the meeting.

Molotov said that the Soviet delegation agreed with Dulles, Pinay, and Macmillan’s view that the positions of the Soviet Union and the Western countries had become closer in many respects, and the Soviet delegation had no doubt that all participants in the meeting hoped to promote the unification of Germany. He pointed out that if this was the case, the meeting should take practical steps to support the establishment of all-German institutions, so that the two Germanys could work together in the All-German Committee for the benefit of the German people, and also to ensure security throughout Europe.

Molotov finally expressed the hope that after the Western delegations had studied the Soviet delegation's proposal more carefully, they would be able to accept this proposal to a greater extent.

The meeting adjourned at this point. The Foreign Ministers are scheduled to hold their next meeting on the afternoon of November 3.

    四国外长会议讨论欧洲安全和德国问题
    苏联提出建立全德委员会的建议
    据新华社三日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦三日讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长十一月二日举行第五次会议，由比内担任主席。外交部长们继续讨论第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题。
    首先发言的是麦克米伦。他认为，莫洛托夫在上次会议上所提出的欧洲安全条约草案几乎涉及西方国家关于保障安全问题的建议中所包含的一切问题，这种情况表明取得了一定的进展。他接着指出，在提交会议讨论的两个计划之间有重大的区别。这就是：西方国家的建议是以必须重新统一德国为其基本的先决条件，而苏联的建议“似乎忽视这种任务，并且是以德国的分裂为基础的”。麦克米伦还说，西方国家认为，北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟并不威胁欧洲的安全。他认为，苏联的新计划同以前的计划比较，是前进了一步，因为苏联代表团现在看来是同意把关于解散北大西洋公约组织的要求无限期地推迟。
    麦克米伦说，西方国家愿意讨论这一条约草案中或者任何新的条约中关于保证问题和彼此协商问题的各项条款。但是西方国家在这一问题上除了采取德国必须统一的观点外，不能够采取其他观点。
    麦克米伦最后表示，如果苏联代表团不提出关于重新统一德国问题方面的建议的话，讨论第一个问题就不会有结果。
    随后，杜勒斯和比内就莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全问题的发言和他所提出的欧洲安全条约草案发表意见。
    杜勒斯说，关于第一项议程前部分，即关于安全问题的讨论已经使我们的立场大大地接近了。如果我们在这个议程的另一部分也能获得这样的成就，那末我们就将不辜负全世界对我们这次会议的期望。
    杜勒斯说，把双方建议比较一下，可以得出结论：西方国家代表团和苏联代表团在“想法上有相当大程度的类似”，虽然双方建议的措词并不总是相同的。
    杜勒斯接着说，由于双方建设性的考虑，目前存在着通过缔结安全条约来建立欧洲安全的实际前景。但是会议在第一项议程的第二部分，即统一德国的问题上还没有取得任何成就。他认为苏联提出自己的统一德国的建议是很重要的和迫切的。他说，在西方还没有了解苏联对“关于通过自由选举恢复德国统一”问题的意见以前，在欧洲安全问题的讨论上是不可能获得进展的。
    比内也说，苏联必须就德国问题提出建议，这样会议才能够继续工作下去。
    比内认为苏联所提的欧洲安全条约已经充分地估计了西方三国的这种意见：它们永远不能同意苏联的安全协定以取消大西洋集团和西欧联盟作为基础。
    比内接着对莫洛托夫所说的西方国家关于限制和监督军队和军备问题的建议值得重视这一句话，表示满意。
    比内指出，西方国家和苏联的立场的重大分歧是，苏联认为德意志联邦共和国和东德应当参加安全体系，而西方国家不能同意欧洲安全不建立在德国重新统一的基础上。
    在比内发言结束后，莫洛托夫就欧洲安全和德国问题发言（见第三版），并且把苏联政府关于建立全德委员会的建议提交会议讨论。
    杜勒斯随后发言。他表示要十分仔细地研究苏联代表团的声明全文。他说，只要我们在统一德国问题上达成协议，在安全问题上达成协议是有可能的。杜勒斯说，苏联的关于建立全德委员会的建议使他有些灰心，因为这一建议不仅是不实际的，而且是明显地背离了政府首脑的指示。他希望，在会议讨论恢复德国统一问题之后，苏联代表团能够提出一个更充分地反映四国政府首脑指示并且更多地考虑西方三国意见的建议。
    杜勒斯补充说，他希望苏联代表团将对在德国举行自由选举的问题提出自己的建议，或者同意西方国家的建议。
    比内首先声明他还没有时间仔细研究苏联代表团提出的建议，然后又对莫洛托夫的发言表示意见。他说，西方国家的建议并没有要保证条约的生效从属于西德的加入北大西洋公约组织。他硬说，苏联的建议的目的是要把某种性质的经济、社会和政治制度强加在德国人民身上，而西方国家却只是在力求通过消除德国的分裂而结束欧洲的不稳定状态。
    麦克米伦接着发言。他表示将认真地研究苏联的建议。他说，实现德国统一不应当以两个德意志国家之间的协商为基础，而应当通过自由选举。他说，建立一个能够自由地决定自己的外交政策和国内政策问题的独立统一的德国是中心的问题。德国应当有可能自己决定它希望加入任何联盟和同盟。
    麦克米伦最后表示希望苏联代表团在统一德国的问题上以及在自由选举和建立独立的德国政府的问题上同西方国家的立场趋于接近，这样就能够达成完全的协议。
    莫洛托夫接着发言说：由于时间不够，今天会议上还不可能认真地讨论苏联代表团的发言，但是苏联代表团注意到美、法、英三国代表团关于准备研究苏联建议的表示。
    莫洛托夫说，我们是主张举行全德选举的。但是有各种各样的选举，譬如，有过这样的全德选举，由于这种选举的结果，议会的权力一步一步地落到希特勒手里，随后他就发动了第二次世界大战。
    莫洛托夫说，四国政府都曾经承担义务，为了欧洲安全并确保德国成为和平和民主的国家，使德国不再落入那些可能在欧洲和在全世界挑起新战争的势力的掌握之中。四国政府首脑就德国问题作出的指示正是从这一观点出发的。指示指出，德国问题的解决和通过自由选举重新统一德国的工作应该在符合德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益的情况下进行。莫洛托夫指出，杜勒斯和麦克米伦、比内都避而不谈这一点。
    莫洛托夫接着说道，特别奇怪的是，西方三国代表都根本不谈苏联代表团关于促使两个德国接近以及建立全德机构的建议。莫洛托夫指出，会议没有理由不在这样一个作为准备实实在在的统一德国的第一步的问题上接近起来，也没有理由害怕在会议上听取德国人民的代表的发言。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团同意杜勒斯、比内和麦克米伦所说的关于苏联和西方国家在许多方面的立场已经接近的意见，苏联代表团不怀疑，会议的所有参加者都希望促成德国的统一。他指出，如果是这样，会议就应当采取实际的步骤，支持建立全德机构，使两个德国在全德委员会中可以为德国人民的利益，同时也为保障全欧安全而共同努力。
    莫洛托夫最后表示，希望西方国家的代表团在更仔细地研究苏联代表团的建议以后，能在更大的程度上接受这一建议。
    会议到此休会。外长们定于十一月三日下午举行下次会议。
