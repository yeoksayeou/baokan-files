The Huai'de County Committee of Jilin Province has stipulated four standards for the completion of agricultural production cooperatives: 1. Reasonably determine the compensation for major means of production such as land and draught animals; draft the cooperative's charter; 2. Determine and raise the share fund; accurately issue the poor peasant cooperative fund loans to those who should receive them; 3. Establish a management committee through democratic elections by the members' congress; determine the keepers and custodians; 4. Establish accounts. It is also stipulated that after completion, production should be organized, and research and discussion on next year's production plan should begin.

What does it really mean to have a cooperative "completed?" It is indeed necessary to make clear regulations. The Huai'de County Committee's regulations on the standards for completing cooperatives can ensure that cooperatives have a certain quality. However, the regulations of the Huai'de County Committee also have some less-than-appropriate aspects. To complete all these matters before starting to organize production will cause production to stall for a period; the preliminary determination of production organization and short-term plans for current farm work should also be taken as a standard. Regarding the share fund, it is not necessary to stipulate that it must be fully raised before the cooperative is established; it is possible to first determine the amount and method of raising it, raise what is urgently needed first, and then slowly raise the rest. The cooperative's charter cannot simply be "drafted," it must be discussed and adopted by the members' congress. In addition to the management committee, the supervisory committee should also be elected at the time of establishment.

    规定建成合作社的标准
    吉林省怀德县委规定了建成农业生产合作社的四条标准：一、合理地确定了土地、耕畜等主要生产资料的报酬；拟定了社章；二、确定和筹集了股份基金；准确地把贫农合作基金贷款发给应得贷款的人；三、经过社员大会民主选举成立了管理委员会；确定了饲养员、保管员；四、建立了账目。并且规定：建成以后就要组织生产，开始研究和讨论明年的生产计划。
    怎样才叫做把一个社“建成了”？这的确需要作出明确规定。怀德县委规定了建成合作社的标准，就可以保证合作社有一定的质量。不过，怀德县委的规定也有不十分妥善的地方。要把这些事情都做完才着手组织生产，就会使生产停顿一个时期；应当把初步确定生产组织和当前农活的短期计划也作为一条标准。对于股份基金，却不必规定必须在建社之前完全筹集齐毕；可以先确定筹集的数量和办法，把当前急需的先筹集起来，然后慢慢筹集。社章不能只是“拟定了”就算，必须由社员大会讨论通过。除了管理委员会以外，监察委员会也是在建社的时候就应该选举出来的。
