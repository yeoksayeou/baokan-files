　　Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and other cities
　　A large number of private factories implement joint public-private ownership
　　Shanghai Yong'an Company to implement joint public-private ownership soon
　　(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 23rd dispatch) The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee has approved the implementation of joint public-private ownership for all private paint industrial enterprises in Shanghai. In order to lead the reorganization and transformation of the paint industry in Shanghai, relevant parties have established a preparatory office for a paint industry specialized company. A preparatory committee for joint public-private ownership in the paint industry has also been established.
　　The total output value of Shanghai's paint industry accounts for about half of the country's total. It is not only necessary for heavy industry, national defense industry, and transportation industry, but also an indispensable material for furniture and supplies manufacturing. However, the machinery, equipment, and management of the original 27 private paint factories in Shanghai were very backward. Among all enterprises, 15 factories processed orders, and 12 factories produced and sold their own products. Apart from 10 factories with more than 16 employees, the rest were small factories with fewer than 10 employees. After the implementation of joint public-private ownership for the entire industry, all paint factories will be merged and reorganized into four joint public-private factories. They will implement professional division of labor with two local state-owned factories and carry out production according to national plan requirements.
　　(Our newspaper, Shanghai, 23rd dispatch) Today, the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee approved the request of the largest private department store in the country, Yong'an Co., Ltd., to implement joint public-private ownership.
　　Private Yong'an Company was founded in 1918. The business area totals 13,400 square meters, and it deals in more than 14,000 categories of goods. Before liberation, most of the goods this company dealt with were high-end luxury goods. After liberation, under the leadership of the state-owned economy, the business direction changed. In November 1954, it signed a wholesale purchase contract with the state-owned department store. In March this year, the state-owned department store further expanded the types of goods that Yong'an Company distributed and sold on commission.
　　On November 23, the Shanghai municipal authorities convened a meeting of directors, supervisors, and actual responsible persons of the capitalist side of Yong'an Company, announcing the news that the People's Government had approved Yong'an Company's joint public-private ownership. Guo Linshuang, general manager of Yong'an Company, said at the meeting that he would work hard in the future and gradually transform himself into a citizen who loves labor in the process of enterprise transformation. Yong'an Company employees were even more excited. More than 40 employees organized a celebratory team to spread the good news to employees in various departments. Many stores also sent people to congratulate Yong'an Company employees.
　　(Our newspaper, Chongqing, 23rd dispatch) Chongqing held a conference on November 22 for the implementation of joint public-private ownership in 24 private factories. These factories were recently approved for joint public-private ownership by the Chongqing Municipal People's Committee based on national needs, the possibility of enterprise transformation, and the principle of capitalists' voluntariness. Among them, private Southwest Chemical Factory, Yongji Steel Factory, Tongjunge Pharmaceutical Factory, and Huazhong Machine Factory will implement joint public-private ownership independently. Private Weichang Yarn Factory and Xinghua Paint Factory will merge with the already joint public-private Yuhua Textile Factory and Chongqing Paint Factory to implement joint public-private ownership. The 18 factories in the private rubber and battery industries (groups) will also first merge and then implement joint public-private ownership for the entire industry. After the implementation of joint public-private ownership, these private factories will change their past state of simple equipment, backward management, scattered locations, and frequent failure to complete production plans.
　　(Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 23rd dispatch) Currently, there are 179 private factories in Guangzhou that have implemented joint public-private ownership, including 19 industries. Although these joint public-private factories only account for slightly more than 4 percent of the total number of private industrial enterprises in the city, the joint public-private industries are relatively large-scale industries, and their output value accounts for about 32.29 percent of the city's total private industrial output value.
　　After these private industries were reorganized into joint public-private enterprises, due to the initial implementation of socialist enterprise management principles and overcoming the speculative and blind nature of capitalist management, production began to be incorporated into the national planned track, changing the extremely chaotic and wasteful phenomenon of production management during the private period, and significantly improving the productivity of the enterprises. For example, after the private Eryou Toothpaste Factory implemented joint public-private ownership and established a quality inspection system, the past grade B and grade C products were upgraded to grade A. The scrap rate of the Shanghai Flexible Tube Factory decreased from 11.5 percent before joint public-private ownership to below 5.5 percent.
　　With the change of enterprise production relations, labor-capital relations have become more normal, workers have changed their work attitude, unprecedentedly cared about production, actively tapped production potential, put forward rationalization proposals, and improved production, resulting in a general increase in enterprise profits. For example, after the private Huanan Thread Factory implemented joint public-private ownership, the worker attendance rate increased by 12 percent compared to before joint public-private ownership, and the non-conforming products also decreased from 46.3 percent to 5 percent. Under the education of facts, many capitalists have eliminated their concerns and worked actively. Liu Shiting, deputy director of the joint public-private Yifeng Enamel Factory and representative of the capitalist side, has disclosed the long-kept secret formula of the enamel powder mixture.
　　(Our newspaper dispatch) The Hangzhou Municipal People's Committee recently approved the implementation of joint public-private ownership in 38 private silk factories. In this way, all private silk factories in Hangzhou that process silk for export have implemented joint public-private ownership.
　　Silk is a specialty of Hangzhou, known in the international market. These silk factories that recently implemented joint public-private ownership all produce silk for export. Before joint public-private ownership, these factories could not adapt to the needs of production development due to their small scale, backward technology, decentralized operations, and chaotic management. Before the implementation of joint public-private ownership, the Hangzhou Municipal Bureau of Industry had initially rectified and transformed these factories through methods such as merger and joint management.

　　上海、重庆、广州、杭州等城市
　　大批私营工厂实行公私合营
　　上海市永安公司即将实行公私合营
    本报上海二十三日电　上海市私营造漆工业企业已得到上海市人民委员会批准实行全行业公私合营。为了领导上海造漆工业全业的改组改造工作，有关方面已经成立了造漆业专业公司筹备处。造漆工业的公私合营筹备委员会也已成立。
    上海市造漆工业的总产值约占全国造漆工业的一半左右，它不仅为重工业、国防工业和交通运输工业所必需，也是家具、用品制造所不可缺少的材料。但上海旧有的二十七户私营造漆厂的机器设备和经营管理都很落后。全业中属于加工订货工厂十五户，自产自销厂十二户，除了十户是十六人以上的工厂外，其余都是十人以下的小厂。实行全行业公私合营以后，所有造漆工厂将全部实行合并，改组成四个公私合营工厂。它们将和两个地方国营厂实行专业分工，按照国家计划要求进行生产。
    本报上海二十三日电　今天，上海市人民委员会批准了全国最大的私营百货商店——永安股份有限公司实行公私合营的要求。
    私营永安公司创设于一九一八年。商场面积共有一万三千四百平方公尺，经营商品有一万四千多类。解放以前，这个公司经营的商品大部分是高贵奢侈品，解放后在国营经济领导下，经营方向有了改变，一九五四年十一月和国营百货公司签订了批购合约，今年三月国营百货公司又对永安公司进一步扩大了经销、代销商品种类。
    十一月二十三日，上海市主管部门召集了永安公司的董监事和资方实职人员集会，宣布了人民政府批准永安公司公私合营的消息，永安公司总经理郭琳爽在会上表示今后将努力工作，在企业改造过程中，逐步把自己改造成为热爱劳动的公民。永安公司职工更是欢欣鼓舞，四十多个职工组织了报喜队，向各部门职工报喜，许多商店也纷纷派人前来向永安公司职工祝贺。
    本报重庆二十三日电　重庆市在十一月二十二日举行了二十四个私营工厂实行公私合营大会。这些工厂是重庆市人民委员会根据国家需要、企业改造的可能和资本家的自愿的原则在最近批准公私合营的。其中除私营西南化工厂、永记钢厂、桐君阁药厂和华中机器厂等厂单独进行公私合营以外，私营维昌纱厂和兴华油漆厂分别同已经公私合营的裕华纺织厂和重庆油漆厂合并实行公私合营，私营橡胶和电池两个行业（组）十八个厂也是先并厂然后实行全行业的公私合营的。这些私营工厂在实行公私合营以后，将会改变过去设备简陋、经营管理落后、地区分散和经常不能完成生产计划的状态。
    本报广州二十三日电　广州市目前已经进行公私合营的私营工厂有一百七十九户，包括十九个行业。这些公私合营的工厂虽然只占全市私营工业总户数的百分之四强，但公私合营工业都是比较大型的工业，其产值约占全市私营工业产值百分之三十二点二九。
    这些私营工业经过改组为公私合营企业后，由于初步实行了社会主义企业管理原则，克服了资本主义经营管理的投机性和盲目性，生产开始纳入了国家计划轨道，改变了私营时期生产管理极度混乱和浪费很大的现象，使企业的生产力有了显著的提高。如私营二友牙膏厂，实行公私合营后，由于建立了质量检查制度，过去的乙级、丙级产品都提高到甲级。上海软管厂的废品率由公私合营前占百分之十一点五降到百分之五点五以下。
    随着企业生产关系的改变，劳资关系更趋于正常，工人改变了劳动态度，空前地关心生产，积极地挖掘生产潜力，提合理化建议，改进生产，使企业盈余普遍增加。如私营华南线辘厂公私合营以后，工人出勤率比公私合营前提高了百分之十二，不合规格的产品也从百分之四十六点三降到百分之五。许多资本家在事实的教育下，消除了顾虑，积极工作。公私合营益丰搪瓷厂副厂长、资方代表刘士挺，已把长期守密的琅粉配料方公开了。
    本报讯　杭州市人民委员会最近批准了三十八个私营绸厂实行公私合营。这样，杭州市加工外销绸缎的私营绸厂已经全部实行公私合营了。
    绸缎是杭州的特产，闻名国际市场。最近公私合营的这些绸厂，生产的都是外销绸缎。公私合营以前，这些工厂因为规模小、技术落后、经营分散、管理混乱，不能适应生产发展的需要。这次实行公私合营以前，杭州市工业局曾经通过合并联合管理等方式对这些厂进行了初步的整顿改造。
