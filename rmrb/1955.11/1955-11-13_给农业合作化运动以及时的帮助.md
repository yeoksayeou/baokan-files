　　Giving Timely Help to the Agricultural Cooperation Movement
　　Shi Xin
    The agricultural cooperation movement, which is forming a high tide nationwide, has brought enormous propaganda tasks to the Party's newspapers. Newspapers should be ahead of this movement, reflecting new situations and new problems in the movement in a timely manner, and bringing them to the attention of the entire Party and all peasants. Only in this way can newspapers truly play the role of the Party's assistant and provide practical help to the agricultural cooperation movement.
    Currently, some newspapers are doing just that. The Hebei Daily is one that is doing a relatively good job. Since the agricultural cooperation movement in Hebei Province entered a new high tide, the Hebei Daily has paid attention to raising new issues at any time in conjunction with the development of the movement. From September 16th to the end of October, just looking at the editorials published in this newspaper, it raised and discussed the following issues: strengthening the preparation work for developing agricultural cooperatives, doing a good job of overall planning for agricultural cooperation, strengthening specific leadership over newly established cooperatives, and so on. While expounding on the issue of developing agricultural cooperatives, the newspaper also addressed the situation in some areas where only the development of new cooperatives was emphasized while neglecting the consolidation of existing cooperatives, proposing to rectify and consolidate existing agricultural cooperatives with autumn harvest distribution as the central content; and in response to the situation in some areas where only the establishment of cooperatives was emphasized while neglecting the urgent task of autumn plowing and wheat planting, it repeatedly discussed the importance of seizing the opportunity to do a good job of autumn plowing and autumn planting.
    Of course, the responsibility of newspapers is not only to raise issues, but also to come up with solutions. The Hebei Daily did not neglect this point. When it raised the many issues mentioned above, it introduced and promoted the experiences of some localities in solving these problems. For example, regarding the issue of overall planning, the newspaper not only reported on how some counties started with class analysis and determined the cooperative planning for phased and batch development according to the economic status and awareness level of various peasant households, but also reported on how some counties combined cooperative planning with production planning; it not only reported on the experience of one county in conducting overall planning, but also reported on the experience of one township in conducting overall planning.
    It is precisely because many of the issues raised by the Hebei Daily are emerging in real life, and generally speaking, they are raised in a relatively timely manner, that the raising of these issues can promote the current movement to advance along the correct track. For example, when the newspaper published editorials on "Strengthening Specific Leadership Over Newly Established Cooperatives" and "Rectifying and Consolidating Agricultural Production Cooperatives with Autumn Harvest Distribution as the Central Content" in mid-October, there was a tendency in the cooperative movement in the Shijiazhuang Special District to only focus on developing new cooperatives, neglecting the consolidation of old cooperatives and the specific leadership of newly established cooperatives. After studying the newspaper's editorials, the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Committee immediately organized cadres to go to the countryside to inspect work and issued instructions requiring the correction of the aforementioned tendencies. The many working experiences disseminated by the newspaper have become a powerful weapon for the vast number of rural cadres to solve problems in their work. Niu Zhongfu, a staff member of the Xushui County Party Committee, once wrote to the editorial department saying that he previously did not know what production planning included or how to do it. After seeing the "Experience of Xingtai County in Conducting Overall Production Planning" and other articles published in the Hebei Daily on September 30th, he and the grassroots cadres initially formulated the cooperative plan for Shangzhuang Township and the production plan for the Red Flag Agricultural Cooperative. He expressed his gratitude for the newspaper's help.
    Like the Hebei Daily, striving to be ahead of the agricultural cooperation movement and giving the movement timely and practical help, there are also the Southern Daily and other newspapers. These newspapers' practices are good. However, we also see another situation. Some newspapers are only enthusiastic about reflecting the enthusiastic emotions of the broad masses of peasants demanding to take the road of cooperation and the vigorous development and scale of the cooperative movement. Of course, paying attention to reporting these contents is very necessary, and it cannot be said that our newspapers have already reported them very well. However, if we are only satisfied with reporting these, and do not pay attention to raising new situations and new problems in the movement in a timely manner, reflecting the difficulties and contradictions in the movement, and pointing out the ways to overcome difficulties and solve contradictions, then it cannot be said that the newspaper has fully fulfilled its responsibilities. When the broad masses of cadres have listened to the transmission of Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" or studied this document, have realized the past right-leaning errors and are determined to correct these errors, there are also a few newspapers that do not enthusiastically give them help and encouragement, analyze the causes of the errors, and point out ways to correct the errors, but instead criticize them blindly, even rudely rebuke them. Some of the commentary short articles (miscellaneous talks) published by the Anhui Daily from late September to mid-October have this shortcoming. These short articles describe those comrades who have had right-leaning errors as "worrying needlessly," "making trouble out of nothing," "all are ideological idlers and political mediocrities," "only care about enjoying themselves and have no socialist enthusiasm, only care about their own 'tranquility' and do not care about the vital interests of the masses"... I ask, when cadres have already begun to recognize their mistakes, and are making efforts to correct their mistakes with practical actions, what benefits does such "criticism" have for improving the ideological level of cadres and for promoting the current movement?
    In his report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation," Comrade Mao Zedong instructed Party committees at all levels to check their work at any time, and to discover and solve problems at any time when leading the cooperative movement; criticism should also be timely criticism, and do not always like post-mortem criticism. The newspaper is a tool of leadership. Comrade Mao Zedong's instruction is also fully applicable to our newspaper work.

### 给农业合作化运动以及时的帮助

　　给农业合作化运动以及时的帮助
　　湜辛
    在全国范围内正在形成高潮的农业合作化运动，给党的报纸带来了巨大的宣传任务。报纸应当走在这个运动的前面，及时地反映运动中的新情况新问题，把它们提到全党和全体农民的面前。这样，报纸才算真正发挥了党的助手的作用，才算给了农业合作化运动以切实的帮助。
    目前有些报纸正是这样做的。河北日报便是做得比较好的一个。自从河北省的农业合作化运动进入新的高潮以来，河北日报就注意结合运动的发展随时提出新的问题。从九月十六日到十月底，单拿这个报纸发表的社论来看，就提出和讨论了这样一些问题：加强发展农业社的准备工作，做好农业合作化的全面规划，加强对新建社的具体领导等等。在阐述发展农业合作社问题的同时，报纸还针对有些地方只顾发展新社忽视原有社的巩固工作的情况，提出要以秋收分配为中心内容来整顿和巩固原有农业合作社；并且针对有些地方只顾建社忽视当前秋耕种麦的紧迫任务的情况，反复地论述了抓紧时机搞好秋耕秋种的重要。
    当然，报纸的责任不光是提出问题，而且要拿出解决问题的办法。河北日报并没有忽视这一点。它在提出上面所说的许多问题的时候，就介绍和推广了一些地方解决这些问题的经验。例如，关于全面规划问题，报纸不仅报道了一些县份怎样从阶级分析入手，按各种农户的经济地位和觉悟程度确定分批分期发展的合作化规划的做法，而且报道了一些县份怎样结合合作化规划进行生产规划的做法；不仅报道了一个县进行全面规划的经验，而且报道了一个乡进行全面规划的经验。
    正是因为河北日报所提出的许多问题是实际生活中出现的，而且一般说来又提得比较及时，所以这些问题的提出就能推动当前的运动沿着正确的轨道前进。例如，十月中旬报纸发表“加强对新建社的具体领导”和“以秋收分配为中心内容整顿巩固农业生产合作社”的社论的时候，石家庄专区的合作化运动中就存在着只顾发展新社，不注意巩固老社和对新建社进行具体领导的偏向。石家庄地委在学习了报纸的社论后，立即组织干部下乡检查工作，并发出指示，要求纠正上面所说的偏向。报纸所传播的许多工作经验更成为广大农村干部解决工作中的问题的有力武器。徐水县委的工作人员牛中孚曾经写信给编辑部说，他以前不知道生产规划包括哪些内容、怎样搞法，看到河北日报九月三十日发表的“邢台县进行全面生产规划的经验”等文章后，他就同基层干部初步作出了商庄乡的合作化规划和红旗农业社的生产规划。他对报纸的帮助表示感谢。
    像河北日报这样，力求走在农业合作化运动的前面，给运动以及时的切实的帮助的报纸，还有南方日报等。这些报纸的做法是好的。但是我们也看到另外一种情况。有些报纸只热心于反映广大农民群众要求走合作化道路的热烈情绪和合作化运动蓬勃开展的声势和规模。当然，注意报道这些内容是十分必要的，而且不能说我们的报纸已经报道得很好。但是如果只满足于报道这些，而不注意及时地提出运动中的新情况新问题，反映运动中的困难和矛盾，并指出克服困难解决矛盾的途径，那还不能说报纸已经全面地尽到了自己的责任。当着广大干部听了毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告的传达或学习了这个文件以后，已经认识到过去的右倾错误并决心改正这种错误的时候，也有少数报纸并不是满腔热情地给他们以帮助和鼓励，分析产生错误的原因，指出纠正错误的办法，而是一味地批评，甚至粗暴地斥责。安徽日报在九月下旬至十月中旬发表的某些评论性短文（杂谈），就有这种缺点。这些短文把那些有过右倾错误的同志说成“杞人忧天”，“庸人自扰”，“都是一些思想上的懒汉，政治上的庸人”，“只管自得其乐地混混日子而没有社会主义的积极性，只管自己的‘安宁’而毫不关心群众的切身利益”……。试问，在干部已经开始认识自己的错误，而且用实际行动正在努力改正错误的时候，这样的“批评”对于提高干部的思想水平、对于推动当前的运动究竟有什么好处呢？
    毛泽东同志在“关于农业合作化问题”的报告中，指示各级党委在领导合作化运动中要随时检查工作，随时发现和解决问题；批评也应当是及时的批评，不要老是爱好事后的批评。报纸是一种领导的工具。毛泽东同志的这个指示，对于我们报纸工作也是完全适用的。
