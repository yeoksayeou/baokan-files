　　Prevent Waste After the Harvest
　　The Qianjin and Xinsheng agricultural production cooperatives in Songguantun Village, Fourth District, De County, Shandong Province, recently formulated a plan to increase production. Next year, in terms of water conservancy construction, they will dig 25 new wells, renovate 10 old wells, and purchase one water pump.

　　This plan is practical and achievable. The problem is to educate the cooperative members to actively invest in the cooperative. Both cooperatives achieved unprecedented harvests this year, with total income increasing by more than 40% compared to last year. The income of cooperative members has increased, and their lives have also improved. However, some cooperative members have developed plans for extravagance and waste and are unwilling to invest in the cooperative.

　　The village branch and the cooperative management committee discovered this problem and conducted education among party members, Youth League members, and cooperative cadres, requiring everyone to lead the cooperative members to actively invest in the cooperative. They repeatedly explained to the cooperative members that to complete next year's production increase plan, they must rely on the cooperative members to invest their savings in the cooperative and not solely rely on state loans. They also explained the principles of voluntary investment, with principal and interest, and repayment on schedule. At the same time, they reviewed the past mistakes of coercion and commandism in mobilizing investment. After education, the cooperative members have made planned arrangements for their income, and more than 130 cooperative members have automatically invested 20,600 yuan in the cooperative.

　　Agricultural cooperatives in various regions that have had good harvests this year should pay attention to educating cooperative members to prevent extravagance and waste and actively invest in the cooperatives to expand production next year.

　　丰收以后要防止浪费
    山东省德县四区宋官屯村前进、新生两个农业生产合作社最近制定了增产规划，明年在水利建设方面要打新井二十五眼，锥旧井十眼，买抽水机一部。
    这个规划是切合实际需要也是可能实现的，问题是要教育社员积极向社里投资。这两个社今年都获得了空前的丰收，总收入比去年增加了百分之四十以上。社员的收入增加了，生活也有了改善。但是，有些社员产生了铺张浪费的打算；不愿意向社里投资。
    村支部和社管理委员会发现了这个问题，就在党员、团员和社干部中进行教育，要求大家带动社员积极向社投资，并且反复地向社员群众说明：要完成明年的增产计划，必须靠社员把节约下来的钱向社投资，不能单纯依赖国家的贷款扶持。他们又向社员讲解了自觉自愿、有本有息、按期偿还的投资原则，同时检讨了过去动员投资中的强迫命令错误。经过教育以后，社员们都把自己的收入作了有计划的安排，有一百三十多个社员已自动向社投资二万零六百元。
    今年各地丰收了的农业合作社，应注意教育社员防止铺张浪费，积极向合作社投资，以便扩大明年的生产。
