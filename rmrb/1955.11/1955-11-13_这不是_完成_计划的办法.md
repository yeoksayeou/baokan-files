This is Not the Way to “Complete” the Plan

To the Editor:

　　The local state-owned Jinzhou Wood Furniture Factory has had more than 3,800 upholstered chairs stockpiled since last year. This backlog was caused by using improper means to “complete” the output value plan.

　　In early October of last year, the factory director, Wang Qingzhu, learned from the statistician's report that 32 percent of the factory’s annual output value plan target had not yet been completed. Instead of adopting legitimate methods to increase production, he decided on the following "measure": to rush the production of 4,000 upholstered chairs by the end of the year, each with a reported output value of eight yuan; in this way, not only could the output value plan be completed, but it could also be greatly overfulfilled.

　　Therefore, Director Wang convened a factory affairs meeting and personally arranged this "measure" to complete the annual output value plan. At the meeting, the supply and marketing section chief pointed out: "Chairs are not selling well in the market, and production will only lead to stockpiling; furthermore, there is no empty space in the warehouse, and if the chairs are left outside, they will be damaged by wind and rain." Others also disagreed with this approach. But Director Wang ignored all of this. He said, "Can't we overcome these minor difficulties!" He immediately made the decision to "guarantee that the tasks previously fallen behind in October will be caught up."

　　The 4,000 chairs were completed as scheduled. However, the problem was exactly as the supply and marketing section chief had predicted: very few people wanted to buy them in the market, and there was no place to store them in the warehouse; the chairs were placed in the open air, and although they were covered with oilcloth, over time, they were damaged and deteriorated by wind and sun. Now, although the price of the chairs has been reduced by 23 percent compared to the past, they still cannot be sold.

### 这不是“完成”计划的办法

　  这不是“完成”计划的办法编辑同志：
    地方国营锦州木器厂有三千八百多只布心椅子从去年一直积压到现在。这批积压，是因为用不正当手段来“完成”产值计划而造成的。
    去年十月初，这个厂的厂长王庆助听到统计员的汇报，知道工厂的全年产值计划指标还有百分之三十二没有完成。他不是采取正当的办法来提高生产，却决定这样一项“措施”：到年底赶制出四千只布心椅子，每只产值报八元；这样，产值计划不但可以完成，而且还能大大地超额完成。
    于是，王厂长就召开厂务会议，亲自布置这项完成全年产值计划的“措施”。会上，供销股长提出：“市场上椅子销路不好，生产了也要积压；再说仓库里已经没有空地方，椅子搁在外边，风吹雨淋，坏了怎么办？”别的人也不同意这种做法。但是王厂长却不管这些。他说：“难道这点困难还克服不了！”马上就作出决定，要大家“保证在十月份把以前亏下的任务赶上”。
    四千只椅子如期完成了。但是问题正像供销股长估计的那样：市场上要买的人极少，仓库里又没有地方放；椅子放在露天里，虽然用油布遮盖，但是日久天长，风吹日晒，有的也受损变质了。现在椅子的价格虽然比过去降低百分之二十三，但是仍然卖不出去。
