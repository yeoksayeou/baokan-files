Xinhua News Agency, Paris, November 26th: According to TASS, in view of the fact that the Western countries' attitude at the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference prevented the conference from passing resolutions on important international issues, the Executive Committee of the French National Peace Council issued a statement demanding that French patriots more resolutely oppose any attempt to restore the "Cold War."

The statement emphasized that the main obstacle to solving the German question is the Paris Agreement, and the responsibility for the fact that the German question has not yet been resolved lies with the creators of these agreements, which stipulate the rearmament of West Germany and its inclusion in the North Atlantic Group.

The statement said that the French public must reaffirm its will and immediately demand that the government and parliament implement an independent policy. The main objectives of this policy must be to conclude agreements on security and control that both Germanys can participate in and that can avoid the danger of German militarization; to take effective measures on disarmament; to ban atomic weapons; and to systematically develop economic and cultural exchanges with Eastern countries.

　　法国和平理事会执行委员会发表声明
　  号召法国爱国者坚决地反对恢复“冷战”
    新华社二十六日讯　据塔斯社巴黎二十五日讯：鉴于西方国家在日内瓦四国外交部长会议上的态度使得会议未能在重要的国际问题上通过决议这一事实，法国全国和平理事会执行委员会发表声明，要求法国爱国者更加坚决地反对任何恢复“冷战”的企图。
    声明强调指出，解决德国问题的主要障碍是巴黎协定，德国问题至今没有得到解决的责任在于规定重新武装西德和把它包括在北大西洋集团内的这些协定的缔造者。
    声明说，法国公众必须重申它的意志并且立刻要求政府和议会执行一个独立政策。这个政策的主要目的必须是缔结两个德国都能参加的而且能够避免德国军国主义化的危险的关于安全和控制的协定；在裁军问题上采取有效的措施；禁止原子武器；有系统地发展同东方国家的经济和文化交流。
