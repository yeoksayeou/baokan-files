The so-called "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in various places in the past, regardless of how many small differences there were between them, or thought they had distinctions, served the feudal landlord class, imperialism, and the bourgeoisie, and stood on the side of the reactionary regime. The only difference between them was that some stood on the position of the feudal landlord class, colluding with and relying on imperialism; others stood on the position of the comprador bourgeoisie, representing imperialism, especially American imperialism, and colluding and contacting the feudal landlord class. The former was represented by the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in Zouping, Shandong, and other places, organized by Liang Shuming; the latter was represented by the Chinese Mass Education Movement, led by Y. C. James Yen.

I participated in the Chinese Mass Education Movement for many years in the past, carrying out "rural construction" work; I also knew Liang Shuming for many years, and used to attach great importance to his ideas. Recently, after reading the articles of Feng Youlan, Wu Jingchao, Xu Zongmian and others, I further realized the reactionary essence of Liang Shuming's thought, and my own ugly image in the past.

In this short article, I do not intend to make ideological or theoretical analysis and criticism, but to present some facts to expose the reactionary essence of the so-called "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in the past.

First of all, in terms of the source of funds, Liang Shuming and others first ran the Village Governance College in Henan, and the funds were paid by the puppet Henan Provincial Government. At that time, the chairman of the puppet Henan Province was Han Fuju. After Han Fuju left Henan, the Village Governance College could not continue, and all the teachers and students went to Beijing. After Han Fuju became the chairman of the puppet Shandong Province, Liang Shuming and others established the Rural Construction Research Institute in Zouping, Shandong, and the funds were paid by the puppet Shandong Provincial Government. Later, the puppet National Government passed the so-called "County Administration Reform" proposal at the Second Internal Affairs Conference, which included the provision of "setting up county administration construction experimental zones." Liang Shuming and Y. C. James Yen both attended this meeting. Since then, the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" has had a basis for drawing funds from the puppet Shandong Provincial Government's budget, and the rural autonomy organs organized by Liang Shuming have actually become part of the puppet government organs. Subsequently, some provinces also saw the emergence of so-called "experimental counties" or "experimental zones." The people associated with Liang Shuming were not completely unrelated to "financial resources" "from foreign countries." Around 1933, the American "Rockefeller Foundation" – that is, the foundation of the "American Oil King" – came to China to "help rural movement groups" and promote "rural construction." Nankai University, Jinling University, Peking Union Medical College, Yenching University and the Chinese Mass Education Movement jointly formed a "North China Rural Construction Promotion Association" to carry out research, experimentation, and training work related to "rural construction." At that time, Zouping's approach had been extended to Jinan, Heze and other commissioner districts. The "North China Rural Construction Promotion Association" cooperated with the puppet Jinan Commissioner's Office to set up an "Internship Office" in Jinan. Some people from these cooperative organizations worked in Jinan, and some students interned in Jinan. It cannot be said that there was no relationship in terms of funding.

As for the Chinese Mass Education Movement, its funding has relied on American imperialism from the beginning. In addition to requesting funds from the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, it has also applied for "subsidies" from the "Milbank Memorial Fund," "Carnegie Foundation," "Rockefeller Foundation," and "United China Relief," solicited "donations" from individual American imperialist elements, and requested funds from the "American Aid" of the "Joint Committee on Rural Reconstruction." The main source of funds was provided by American imperialism. The "County Administration Construction Research Institute" established by the association in Dingxian according to the so-called "County Administration Reform" proposal, with an annual budget of nearly 100,000 yuan, was paid by the puppet Hebei Provincial Government. In the process of promotion, it also took money from the puppet government. The funds for running "experimental counties" in Hunan and Sichuan were also paid by the puppet provincial governments of Sichuan and Hunan.

Judging from the source of funds, it is already very clear who the so-called "Rural Movement" served.

Liang Shuming once said that the cooperative was a kind of doctrine for him, "a kind of socialism." But how did he actually run the cooperative? He himself said in the same article, "Our Zouping American Cotton Sales Cooperative, although there are quite a few members among the cotton ginning workers, there are also non-members... which to some extent contains the nature of exploiting others' labor to make profits." Obviously, this kind of cooperative has an exploitative nature. Liang Shuming himself frankly said that this is "a cooperative in the transitional stage, which, in a sense, is also like a kind of capitalism." (All quotations are from "The Road to China's Cooperative Movement") However, seriously speaking, the cooperatives in Zouping and Dingxian actually served the interests of landlords and rich peasants and supplied raw materials to imperialism. The American Cotton Sales Cooperative run in Zouping was quite appreciated by the reactionary forces at that time. However, it is worth noting that: (1) It runs the sale of cotton, (2) The Bank of China has invested heavily. The superficial liveliness of finance is due to the bank's temporary investment. The so-called "restoring agricultural productivity" benefits landlords and rich peasants; what is increased is the raw materials needed by imperialism. The cooperative in Dingxian is the same thing. Didn't the Jincheng Bank, the Economic Research Institute of Nankai University, and the Mass Education Movement jointly form a "North China Agricultural Improvement Association"? In fact, Jincheng Bank invests, and the collection of cotton, ginning, packaging, and even transportation out are all handled by the cooperative. In this way, the so-called cooperative is just buying cotton for the bank. Not only Jincheng Bank came to Dingxian, but also the puppet Bank of China. So, the scope was delineated and purchases were made in districts. At the same time, in Dingxian, there were also reports of members borrowing money from the cooperative in the form of credit loans and lending it to farmers at interest. From here, we can see that the cooperatives in Zouping, Dingxian and other places were all controlled by bureaucratic capital, and bureaucratic capital was the assistant of imperialism. It can be seen that the cooperatives opened by the founders of the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in the past did not serve the peasants, but served the feudal landlord class, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Not only that, this kind of cooperative actually echoed the Kuomintang government. Since 1930, hasn't the Kuomintang government been vigorously promoting "cooperatives"? The establishment of the "Training Institute for Cooperative Personnel in the Four Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui and Jiangxi", the establishment of the Farmers Bank, and the handling of agricultural loans are all facts. In 1935, what "Cooperative Law" was promulgated, and what "Cooperative Department" was set up in the puppet Ministry of Industry, and later the so-called "Agricultural Bank" and other agencies "all took cooperatives as their trading objects." It is not obvious who the cooperatives at that time served, is it?

At that time, those who ran the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" also chanted what "Rural Self-Defense" was. Liang Shuming first said it was "Rural Self-Salvation", and then demanded the establishment of "local armed self-defense" forces. In fact, what he wanted to establish was the armed forces of the landlords, and its purpose was to "defend" the feudal order in the countryside and suppress the peasant movement. Peng Yuting, a big local tyrant in Wanxi, Henan, was originally one of the core members of the "Village Governance College" founded by Liang Shuming. He was the most active in running "Rural Self-Defense." After this big local tyrant maintained the local "order" "well" in Wanxi, he also began to run education, cooperation and other undertakings. In order to help him maintain the feudal order, the Mass Education Movement sent people to help run normal schools and mass education as requested. From this kind of fact, doesn't the so-called "Rural Self-Defense" use force to maintain and strengthen the feudal rule?

Sun Zerang, who once served as the vice president of the Zouping Rural Construction Research Institute, later became the puppet Heze Commissioner of Shandong, "promoting" rural construction. In Heze, he ran many rural agricultural schools. He organized and trained a part of the "scholars" with land in the rural agricultural schools into a "self-defense" force. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, when Han Fuju left Shandong, this "self-defense" force did not resist the Japanese or carry out self-defense. Sun Zerang took this force of nearly 10,000 people and fled to Hankou, handing the force over to He Yingqin, the puppet Minister of the Army. From these kinds of examples, the "Rural Self-Defense" advocated by the founders of the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" was just working for the feudal landlord class, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and imperialism.

The so-called "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in the past all tried to rely on the so-called "local leaders," the so-called "elders and gentry" and the like. Liang Shuming once explained the importance of the "village head" and "school head" who were "above the public," and the Chinese Mass Education Movement also organized so-called "elders' associations" and other things in Dingxian. However, how were these "local leaders" found? In the past, those who did the so-called "rural work" mostly visited and contacted landlords and gentry first when they went to a village, and asked them to "lead" and "promote." In this way, the leadership of the so-called "Rural Reconstruction Movement" was firmly in the hands of the feudal landlord class.

These are the facts that the "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in various places in the past served the reactionary rule.

In recent years, thinking about my past participation in the so-called "Rural Reconstruction" for many years, I really feel ashamed, resentful, and disgusted; and I feel infinite excitement about the various measures of the new China in the countryside. I think the most powerful education is the education of facts, and everyone should obey the truth.

The ideological source of the so-called "Rural Reconstruction Movement" in the past was reactionary subjective idealism. The advocates of this movement closed their eyes and did not look at objective facts or historical development, and insisted on using objective facts to accommodate subjective imagination and wishes. In fact, they stood on a reactionary position and served the feudal forces, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism.

Those who have done this kind of "work" in the past should completely abandon the old set, earnestly pursue the truth. To pursue the truth, the only way is to study sincerely, seek truth from facts, and study Marxism-Leninism. Only in this way can we truly criticize the past thoughts, change our positions, and transform ourselves.

    梁漱溟等所谓“乡村建设运动”是为什么人服务的
    瞿菊农
    过去各地的所谓“乡村建设运动”，不问他们之间有多少小的差别，或者自以为有区别，都是为封建地主阶级、帝国主义、资产阶级服务的，都是站在反动政权一面的。他们的区别只是有的站在封建地主阶级的立场，勾结依靠帝国主义；有的站在买办资产阶级的立场，代表帝国主义尤其是美帝国主义，并勾结联络封建地主阶级。前者以梁漱溟主办的山东邹平等地的“乡村建设运动”为代表；后者以晏阳初主持的中华平民教育促进会为代表。
    我过去曾多年参加中华平民教育促进会，进行“乡村建设”工作；和梁漱溟也认识多年，过去相当重视他的思想。最近读了冯友兰、吴景超、徐宗勉等人的文章，我进一步认识到梁漱溟思想的反动实质，和我自己过去的丑恶形象。
    在这篇短文里，我不打算作思想上、理论上的分析和批判，而是要提出一些事实来，揭露过去所谓“乡村建设运动”的反动实质。
    先就经费的来源说，梁漱溟等人先在河南办村治学院，经费是由伪河南省政府支出的。当时伪河南省主席是韩复矩。韩复矩离开河南，村治学院办不下去，全体师生曾到北京来。韩复矩担任伪山东省主席之后，梁漱溟等人才在山东邹平成立乡村建设研究院，经费由伪山东省政府支付。伪国民政府后来在第二次内政会议通过所谓“县政改革”案，其中有“设置县政建设实验区”的规定。梁漱溟、晏阳初都出席了这次会议。自此之后，“乡村建设运动”在伪山东省政府预算里动支经费，就有了根据，梁漱溟主办的乡村自治机关，实际上也就成伪政府机关的一部分。随后，有些省份也出现了所谓“实验县”或“实验区”。和梁漱溟有关的人们，并不是和“从外国来的”“财源”完全没有关系的。一九三三年前后，美国的“罗氏基金会”——即“美国煤油大王”的基金会——曾到中国来“帮助乡村运动团体”，提倡“乡村建设”。南开大学，金陵大学，协和医学院，燕京大学和中华平民教育促进会等合组了一个“华北农村建设协进会”，进行有关
  “乡村建设”的研究、实验、训练的工作。那时邹平的做法，已推广到济宁，菏泽等专员区。“华北农村建设协进会”曾和伪济宁专员公署合作，在济宁设立了一个“实习处”，这几个合作机关有人在济宁工作，有学生在济宁实习。在经费上不能说没有关系。
    至于中华平民教育促进会，其经费来源则自始依靠美帝国主义。除了向中国教育文化基金董事会请款之外，还曾向“米尔版基金会”、“卡匿奇基金会”、“罗氏基金会”、“美国援华联合委员会”申请“补助”，向美帝国主义分子个人“捐款”，向“农村复兴联合委员会”的“美援”请款，主要财源都是美帝国主义供给的。该会在定县根据所谓“县政改革”案设立的“县政建设研究院”，年近十万元的预算，是由伪河北省政府支出的，在进行推广工作中，也曾向伪政府拿钱。在湖南、四川办“实验县”的经费，也是由四川、湖南两伪省府支出的。
    从经费上看，所谓“乡村运动”是为什么人服务，已经是很明白了。
    梁漱溟曾说过，合作社对于他是一种主义，“是社会主义的一种”。但实际上他是怎样办合作社呢？他自己在同一篇文章上说，“我们邹平的美棉运销合作社，轧花工人固然也有不少的社员，可是也有非社员在内……则多少含有借他人的劳力以营取利润的性质。”显然，这种合作社是带有剥削性质的。梁漱溟自己曾这样坦然地说，这是“在过渡阶段中的合作社，从某一意义说，也很像一种资本主义”。（引文均见“中国合作运动之路向”）但是，认真说来，邹平和定县的合作社实际上是为地主富农的利益服务并为帝国主义供应原料。邹平办的美棉运销合作社，在当时颇得到反动势力的赞赏。然而值得注意的是：（一）办的棉花运销，（二）中国银行曾大量投资。表面上的活泼金融是银行一时的投资所致。所谓“恢复农业生产力”是地主富农得利；增产的是帝国主义需要的原料。定县的合作社也是同样的东西，当时金城银行，南开大学经济研究所和平民教育促进会不是合组了一个“华北农产改进社”吗？实际上，金城银行投资，而收集棉花、轧花、包装直到运输出去，则完全由合作社办。这样，所谓合作社，不过是代银行收买棉花罢了。到定县来的不止金城银行一家，还有伪中国银行。于是划定范围，分区收买。同时，在定县也听得有社员以信用贷款的方式向合作社贷得款子回去向农民放债的事情。从这里可以看到，当时邹平、定县等地的合作社，都受到官僚资本的支配，而官僚资本，则是帝国主义的助手。可见过去“乡村建设运动”创导者开办的合作社并不是为农民服务，而是为封建地主阶级、帝国主义和官僚资本主义服务。不仅如此，这种合作社实际上还和国民党政府相呼应。一九三○年以来，国民党政府不是在大力提倡“合作社”么？设立“豫鄂皖赣四省合作人员训练所”，设立农民银行，办农贷，这些都是事实。一九三五年，还颁定什么“合作社法”，在伪实业部设什么“合作司”，后来又成立所谓“农本局”之类“都以合作社为其交易对象”的机关。那时的合作社是为什么人服务的，难道还不明显么？
    那时办“乡村建设运动”的人，还高唱什么“乡村自卫”。梁漱溟先说是“乡村自救”，进而要求建立“地方武装自卫”的力量。其实，他所要建立的是地主的武装，其目的是为了“保卫”乡村里的封建秩序，镇压农民运动。河南宛西大恶霸彭禹廷本来是梁漱溟创办的“村治学院”的骨干分子之一，他办“乡村自卫”最积极。这个大恶霸在宛西把地方“秩序”维持“好”了之后，也着手办教育、合作之类的事业。平民教育促进会为要帮助他维持封建秩序，曾应约派人去帮助办师范学校和民众教育。从这种事实看来，所谓“乡村自卫”，难道不是用武力维持和加强封建统治么？
    曾经担任邹平乡村建设研究院副院长的孙则让，后来做伪山东菏泽专员，“推广”乡村建设。他在菏泽，办了许多乡农学校。将乡农学校中有土地的一部“学众”，组织训练成一支“自卫”武力。抗战初期，韩复矩离开山东，这支“自卫”武力，并不曾对日抗战，实行自卫。孙则让把这支近一万人的部队带走，逃到了汉口，把部队交给伪陆军部长何应钦。从这类事例来看，“乡村建设运动”创导者主张的“乡村自卫”，不过是替封建地主阶级、官僚资产阶级和帝国主义卖力罢了。
    过去的所谓“乡村建设运动”，都想法依靠所谓“地方领袖人物”，所谓“耆老士绅”之类。梁漱溟曾说明“超居众人之上”的“乡长”“学长”的重要，中华平民教育促进会在定县也组织过所谓
  “耆老会”之类的东西。可是，这些“地方领袖人物”到底是怎样找出来的呢？过去做所谓“乡村工作”的人，到一个村子里，先访问接洽的大都是地主士绅，请他们来“领导”“提倡”。这样，所谓“乡村建设运动”的领导权，就牢牢地掌握在封建地主阶级的手中了。
    这些就是过去各地“乡村建设运动”为反动统治服务的事实。
    这些年来，想到过去自己参与多年的所谓“乡村建设”，实在感到惭愧，感到愤恨，感到憎恶；对于新中国在乡村里的种种措施，又感到无限的兴奋。我觉得，最有力量的教育是事实的教育，每一个人都应当服从真理。
    过去所谓“乡村建设运动”的思想根源是反动的主观唯心论。这个运动的倡导者闭着眼睛不看客观事实，不看历史发展，硬要以客观事实来迁就主观想像和愿望，实际上是站在反动立场上，为封建势力、帝国主义、官僚资本主义服务。
    过去曾经做过这种“工作”的人，应该完全抛弃旧的一套，认真追求真理。要追求真理，唯一的道路是诚诚恳恳地学习，实事求是，学习马克思列宁主义，这样，才能真正地批判过去的思想，转变立场，改造自己。
