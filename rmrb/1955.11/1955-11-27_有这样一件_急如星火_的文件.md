　　A File as "Urgent as a Shooting Star"
To the Editor:
    "Urgent" "Urgent" "Urgent," three large red stamps were affixed to a document issued by the Ministry of Education. On November 2nd, this "urgent as a shooting star" document was sent to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, with the words "Sent to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions" marked on it (presumably meaning to solicit opinions from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions). Consequently, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions immediately conducted research, provided opinions, and returned the document to the Ministry of Education.
    This document was a reply to the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Education Department's request for instructions regarding the standards for pensions following the death of school faculty and staff. Judging from the three "Urgent" red stamps on the document when it was sent out by the Ministry of Education, it seemed that they were striving for speed and timeliness in handling this issue; however, the opposite was true. From the numerous memos and instructions on this document, it could be seen that they displayed a seriously intolerable "passing the buck" attitude in the process of handling this issue.
    The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's report arrived at the Ministry of Education on August 5th. Immediately, this document began circulating among the General Office, the Planning and Finance Department, the Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education Department, the Workers' and Peasants' Accelerated Secondary School Education Department, the Secondary Education Department, the Secondary Normal School Education Department, the Elementary Education Department, the Higher Normal School Education Department, the Cadre Education Bureau, and the relevant sections of these departments and bureaus. During the document's journey, one comrade seemed to feel that this was not very good, and on a note written on August 22nd, offered the opinion: "Please have the General Office decide who should handle this… it shouldn't be randomly circulated." However, this opinion had no effect, and the document continued to be passed around, traveling for over a month. As a result, the document had a total of thirteen notes of various sizes attached, filled with different opinions. Of course, there was no expectation that these opinions could solve any practical problems; the content of these opinions could be expressed in one word – "push"!
    By September 11th, a responsible comrade wrote on a note that the "Planning and Finance Department should take charge." Obviously, this instruction still had no effect. The Planning and Finance Department also wrote a note on October 12th, saying: "Regarding the handling of such issues, there are clear regulations in the research and determination of the division of labor among various units. We cannot handle it just because it involves financial expenditure." Who should be responsible for solving this problem? Nobody knows! Each unit is still actively and diligently "pushing" it outwards!
    On October 25th, the document had been at the Ministry of Education for two months and twenty days. At this point, the "pushing" phase finally ended. A unit of the Ministry of Education was responsible for drafting a reply, which, after being reviewed and signed by the leading comrades of the Ministry of Education, the document, in an "urgent as a shooting star" posture, arrived at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
    This matter should not be seen as an isolated phenomenon. The Ministry of Education needs to draw the necessary lessons from this to improve its work.

### 有这样一件“急如星火”的文件

　　有这样一件“急如星火”的文件编辑同志：
    “急”“急”“急”，三个大红戳子盖在教育部发出的一件文件上。十一月二日，这件“急如星火”的文件送到了中华全国总工会，上面批着“送全国总工会”的字样（意思大概是请全国总工会提意见）。于是，全国总工会马上进行研究，提出意见后把文件退给了教育部。
    这个文件是对内蒙古自治区教育厅请示关于学校教职员工死亡以后的抚恤标准问题的批复。从教育部送出文件的时候三盖“急”字红戳的情况看，似乎他们处理这个问题是力求迅速及时的；但是，情况恰恰相反，从这个文件上的大量签条和批示上可以看出，他们在处理这个问题的过程中，表现出严重得令人不能容忍的“推”的作风。
    内蒙古自治区的这份报告在八月五日就到了教育部。马上，这个文件在办公厅、计划财务司、工农业余教育司、工农速成中学教育司、中学教育司、中等师范教育司、小学教育司、高等师范教育司、干部教育局和这些司、局的有关科旅行起来。在文件旅行的过程中，有一位同志似乎觉得这样不大好，于是在八月二十二日写的一张条子上提出意见：“请办公厅决定，该谁来处理……不应乱批。”可是，这个意见并没有起什么作用，文件还是照样转来转去，先后转了一个多月。结果是文件上面附上了签满各种意见的大小条子共十三张。当然，不必期望这些意见能够解决任何实际问题；这些意见的内容，用一个字来表达——就是“推”！
    到了九月十一日，有一位负责同志在一张条子上批着要“计划财务司主办”。显然这个批示仍然不起什么作用，计划财务司在十月十二日也写了一张条子说：“关于此类问题的处理，在研究和确定各单位分工时，都有明确规定，不能因涉及经费开支就要我司处理。”这个问题究竟应该由谁负责解决呢？不知道！各个单位还是积极努力地往外“推”！
    十月二十五日，这个文件到教育部已经有两个月又二十天，这时总算结束“推”的阶段。教育部有一个单位负责拟出批复的草稿来，经教育部的领导同志审核签字后，文件又以“急如星火”的姿态到了全国总工会。
    不要把这件事看成一个偶然的现象，教育部有必要从这里吸取应有的教训来改进工作。
