　　Xinhua News Agency, Seoul, 19th: According to the Associated Press, a group of South Korean army officers have received more than twenty days of training from six American atomic experts. It is expected that the first phase of the training program will end in January next year.

　　This training work, which violates the principles of the Korean Armistice Agreement, is preparing for the U.S. plan to equip the South Korean army with atomic weapons. The news said that "once full-scale warfare is resumed," the South Korean army will be armed with atomic cannons. South Korean Minister of National Defense Son Won-il and Army Chief of Staff Chung Il-kwon, during their visits to the United States this year, both requested atomic weapons from the United States.

　  美国训练李伪军进行原子战争
    新华社十九日讯　汉城消息：据美联社透露，有一批南朝鲜陆军军官已从六个美国原子专家那里受了二十多天的训练。预料训练计划的第一阶段将在明年一月结束。
    这种违反朝鲜停战协定的原则的训练工作，是替美国的用原子武器装备南朝鲜军队的计划进行准备。消息说，“一旦真枪实弹的战争恢复”，南朝鲜陆军将用原子大炮武装起来。南朝鲜国防部长官孙元一和陆军参谋长丁一权在今年先后到美国访问时，都曾经向美国要原子武器。
