　　The production level of joint state-private industrial enterprises in Beijing has significantly increased this year. According to the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Statistics' data on joint state-private industrial enterprises with production plans for this year, from January to October this year, the total output value of two central joint state-private industrial enterprises increased by an average of 6.6% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by an average of 22% compared with the same period last year; the total output value of twenty-four local joint state-private industrial enterprises increased by an average of 69.7%, and labor productivity increased by an average of 51.6%.
　　Since these industrial enterprises implemented joint state-private ownership, production tasks have been more normal than before, management has also improved, and the enthusiasm of workers has greatly increased. This year, these factories have further strengthened the scientific management of enterprises, promoted advanced experiences, and launched labor competitions and movements to increase production and practice economy, thereby further improving the level of production. Since the Joint State-Private Xingye Wood Factory established a quota-based material requisition and centralized material distribution system in February this year, and implemented a production operation plan, production efficiency and product quality have improved, and costs have been reduced. As a result, from May 1st, the ex-factory price of products was generally reduced by 3%. After the Joint State-Private Jianguo Steel Rolling Plant implemented the team-based economic accounting system, the steel rolling workshop improved production tools, and the first-grade product rate for rolling 6mm diameter round steel in September increased from 75.39% in the first half of the year to 95.42%. The quality of the factory's products has improved, and the consumption of raw materials has been reduced, saving a large amount of steel for the country and reducing costs by 2.14%. The Joint State-Private Sanxing Pencil Factory and Sanming Asbestos Factory also successfully trial-produced new products this year, such as copying pencils, glass pencils, and advanced building materials - "Baolulin Board".
　　The Joint State-Private Sanming Asbestos Factory and Sanxing Pencil Factory have fully completed the national plan for the first three quarters of this year according to the four indicators of total output value, labor productivity, cost, and profit. At present, joint state-private enterprises such as Jinghua Printing House, Shuanghesheng Five Star Beer Soda Factory, Sanxing Pencil Factory, Sanming Asbestos Factory, Chaoyang Electrical and Mechanical Manufacturing Factory, and Daming Wire Factory have already completed the annual total output value plan ahead of schedule.

　　北京市公私合营工业企业今年生产水平显著提高
    北京市公私合营工业企业的生产水平今年有很大的提高。据北京市统计局对今年有生产计划的公私合营工业企业的统计，今年一到十月份，两个中央公私合营工业企业的总产值平均比去年同期增加百分之六点六，劳动生产率平均比去年同期提高百分之二十二；二十四个地方公私合营工业企业的总产值平均增加百分之六十九点七，劳动生产率平均提高百分之五十一点六。
    这些工业企业实行公私合营以后，生产任务比以前正常，经营管理也有了改进，职工生产积极性都大为提高。今年，这些工厂又进一步加强了企业的科学管理，推广了先进经验，开展了劳动竞赛和增产节约运动，因而使生产水平进一步提高。公私合营兴业制材厂从今年二月间建立限额领料、集中配料等制度，实行生产作业计划以后，生产效率和产品质量提高，成本降低。结果从五月一日起，产品对外售价普遍降低了百分之三。公私合营建国轧钢厂推行班组经济核算以后，轧钢车间改进了生产工具，九月份轧制直径六公厘元钢的一级品率由上半年的百分之七十五点三九提高到百分之九十五点四二。全厂产品质量提高，原材料消耗降低，为国家节约了大量钢材，并且降低成本百分之二点一四。公私合营三星铅笔厂、三明石棉厂等还在今年试制成功了拷贝铅笔、玻璃铅笔、高级建筑材料——“鲍露林板”等新产品。
    公私合营三明石棉厂和三星铅笔厂今年前三个季度，都按总产值、劳动生产率、成本、利润四项指标全面完成了国家计划。目前，京华印书局、双合盛五星啤酒汽水厂、三星铅笔厂、三明石棉厂、朝阳机电制造厂、大明电线厂等公私合营企业已经提前完成了全年的总产值计划。
