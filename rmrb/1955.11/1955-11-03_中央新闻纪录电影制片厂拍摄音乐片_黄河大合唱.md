    Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio Filming Musical Film "Yellow River Cantata"
    The Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio is producing the musical film "Yellow River Cantata" to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the death of the people's musician Xian Xinghai. This film will be released in early November.
    "Yellow River Cantata" is China's first musical film. In the film, audiences will not only be able to hear the majestic singing of the "Yellow River Cantata" once again, but also see scenes of the Yellow River rushing straight down and the Yellow River boatmen fighting against the raging waves, as well as the heroic battles of the people on both sides of the Yellow River against Japanese imperialism.
    This film is performed by the Literary and Art Troupe of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, directed by Lü Ban, and conducted by Shi Lemeng. The music consultants are He Shide and Li Huanzhi. The film crew went to the Jundu Ferry and Sanmenxia on the Yellow River in September to shoot outdoor scenes. (Xinhua News Agency)
