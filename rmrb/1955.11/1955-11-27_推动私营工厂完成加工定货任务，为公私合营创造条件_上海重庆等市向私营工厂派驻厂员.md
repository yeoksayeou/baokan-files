　　Promoting Private Factories to Complete Processing Orders and Creating Conditions for Joint Public-Private Ownership
　  Shanghai, Chongqing, and Other Cities Send Factory Representatives to Private Factories
    Since last year, industrial and commercial administrative organs or state-owned economic departments in cities such as Shanghai, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shijiazhuang have dispatched a group of factory representatives to private factories that accept processing orders from state-owned companies. According to statistics as of the end of August this year, the four cities of Shanghai, Chongqing, Hangzhou, and Shijiazhuang have a total of 1,142 factory representatives (also known as supervisors or factory liaison officers), stationed in 702 private factories. These factory representatives are generally stationed in key industries and key factories. Some have one or several people stationed in one factory, while others have one person or one working group stationed in several factories concurrently. Under the leadership of the Party organizations in the private factories where they are stationed, and with the active support and cooperation of the broad masses of workers and the Communist Youth League and trade union organizations, these factory representatives have made excellent achievements in promoting the comprehensive completion of processing orders by private factories and creating conditions for joint public-private ownership of enterprises.
    After being stationed in private factories, the factory representatives in various places, based on the actual production situation of each factory, liaised with state-owned economic departments to rationally arrange the production of these enterprises and supervised the capitalists to correctly accept processing orders. At the same time, they urged the capitalists to formulate production plans, improve business management, and assisted the trade unions in mobilizing workers and technicians to actively improve production technology. In this way, they guaranteed to varying degrees the timely completion of processing orders with the required quality and quantity. In Chongqing, private factories in the steel and machinery industry with resident factory representatives signed 160 processing order contracts last year, all of which were completed as scheduled, with 23 of them even being overfulfilled.
    Factory representatives in various places have promoted production reforms in private factories. Of the 130 private factories to which the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China Department Store Company sent resident factory representatives, more than 90% have established and improved functional departments and management systems. Under the promotion of resident factory representatives, most of the more than 160 private factories in Hangzhou have established production increase and economy committees or production increase and economy groups. The production increase and economy committees of the Xinda, Wuxin, and Wanzheyi cloth factories promoted the capitalists to improve production management, and the defect rates of these three factories in August decreased by 1.4 to 11 percentage points respectively compared with June.
    Factory representatives in various places have conducted unity and education work for the capitalists, which has improved the management enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of many capitalists and reduced illegal activities. Factory representatives in various places also systematically learned about the various aspects of the enterprise through Party, Youth League, and trade union organizations, and they themselves became familiar with production management knowledge.
    Due to the above-mentioned work of the factory representatives, many private factories were more quickly prepared to implement joint public-private ownership. By the end of August this year, 250 private factories in Shanghai with resident factory representatives had been reorganized into joint public-private enterprises.
    Not long ago, the Central Administration for Industry and Commerce convened a meeting to comprehensively study the experience of various places in sending resident factory representatives to private factories that accept processing orders. The meeting held that the work of dispatching resident factory representatives should be strengthened in the future under the premise of overall planning and industrial transformation, strengthened leadership, and gradually promoted.

　　推动私营工厂完成加工定货任务，为公私合营创造条件
　  上海重庆等市向私营工厂派驻厂员
    上海、重庆、杭州、石家庄等市的工商行政机关或国营经济部门，从去年开始向接受国营公司加工定货任务的私营工厂派了一批驻厂员。据截至今年八月底的统计，上海、重庆、杭州、石家庄四市共有驻厂员（或称督导员、驻厂联络员）一千一百四十二人，派驻在七百零二家私营工厂。这些驻厂员一般都驻在重点行业和重点工厂。他们有的是一个人或几个人驻在一个工厂，有的是一个人或一个工作组兼驻几个厂。这些驻厂员在所驻私营工厂党组织的领导下，依靠广大职工和青年团、工会组织的积极支持和配合，在推动私营工厂全面完成加工定货任务和为企业公私合营创造条件等方面作出了很好的成绩。
    各地驻厂员派驻私营工厂以后，都根据各厂生产的实际情况，联系国营经济部门合理地安排了这些企业的生产，监督资本家正确地接受加工定货任务。同时，他们督促资本家制定生产计划，改善经营管理，并且协助工会，发动职工和技术人员积极提高生产技术。这样，就在不同程度上保证了按时、按质、按量地完成加工定货任务。重庆市钢铁机器业有驻厂员的私营工厂去年签订的一百六十份加工定货合同，全部如约完成，其中还有二十三份超额完成。
    各地驻厂员都推动私营工厂进行了生产改革。中国百货公司上海采购供应站派驻驻厂员的一百三十个私营工厂，百分之九十以上都建立和健全了职能科室和经营管理制度。杭州市一百六十多家有驻厂员的私营工厂，在驻厂员的推动下，绝大部分都建立了增产节约委员会或增产节约小组。信大、五新、皖浙义三家布厂的增产节约委员会推动资方改进了生产管理，这三个工厂八月份的次品率就比六月份分别降低百分之一点四到百分之十一。
    各地驻厂员都对资本家进行了团结、教育工作，使不少资本家提高了经营积极性和责任心，减少了违法活动。各地驻厂员还通过党、团、工会组织，系统地了解了企业各方面的情况，自己也熟悉了生产管理知识。
    由于驻厂员进行了上述各方面的工作，不少私营工厂更快地具备了实行公私合营的条件。上海市有驻厂员的私营工厂，在今年八月底以前已经有二百五十家改组为公私合营企业。
    不久以前，中央工商行政管理局召开会议，综合研究了各地向接受加工定货任务的私营工厂派驻驻厂员的经验。会议认为，派驻驻厂员的工作，今后应在全面规划、按业改造的前提下，加强领导，逐步推广。
