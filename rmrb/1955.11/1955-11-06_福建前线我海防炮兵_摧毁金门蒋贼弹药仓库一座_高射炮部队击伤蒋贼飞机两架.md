Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 5th: On the Fujian front, the People's Liberation Army coastal artillery destroyed a munitions depot of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Kinmen Island.

At 8:25 AM on November 2nd, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army entrenched on Greater Kinmen Island shelled Jiaoyu Island in an attempt to harass us. At 4:15 PM on the same day, the enemy artillery again shelled Dadeng Island in an attempt to harass us, firing a total of more than 700 shells. At this time, a certain unit of our coastal artillery retaliated with fierce artillery fire, and bombarded more than 60 Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers active in the Longkou area of Greater Kinmen Island, with all shells hitting the enemy group. Our artillery then hit an enemy ammunition depot on the south side of Height 178 on Taiwu Mountain, Greater Kinmen Island, immediately causing thick smoke and flames, and deafening explosions. The explosions continued until midnight that day, and the smoke and fire lasted until dawn on the 3rd.

Xinhua News Agency, Fujian Front, 4th: On the Fujian front, the People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery units damaged two U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek bandit jet fighters on the 2nd.

At 4:50 PM on November 2nd, four U.S.-made Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter jets sneaked into the airspace above Dongchongkou, Fujian, dropping two bombs into the sea, and then sneaked into the airspace above Huangqi Peninsula, attempting to dive-bomb and strafe. At this time, our anti-aircraft artillery units had already discovered the Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft and made combat preparations. As the first two Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft were diving towards the ground, the gunners on each artillery position gave them a head-on blow with fierce and accurate artillery fire. The fuselage of the first Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft was hit, and the left wing of the second was hit. The two wounded Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft then hurriedly dropped their bombs into the sea near Huangqi Peninsula and fled in a southeast direction. The other two Chiang Kai-shek bandit aircraft also quickly followed the first two damaged enemy aircraft and fled.

    高射炮部队击伤蒋贼飞机两架
    新华社福建前线五日电　福建前线中国人民解放军海防炮兵摧毁了金门岛蒋贼军的一座弹药仓库。
    二日上午八时二十五分，盘踞在大金门岛上的蒋贼军炮兵向我角屿岛发炮袭扰；同日下午四点十五分，敌炮兵又向我大嶝岛发炮袭扰，共计发射炮弹七百余发。这时，我海防炮兵某部以猛烈炮火还击，并且向在大金门岛垅口地区活动的六十多名蒋贼军轰击，炮弹全部命中敌群。我军炮兵接着又击中大金门太武山一七八高地南侧的一座敌军弹药仓库，当即冒起浓烟烈火，响起震耳的爆炸声。爆炸声一直响到当天深夜十二时才停止，烟火持续到三日天明才熄灭。
    新华社福建前线四日电　福建前线中国人民解放军高射炮部队在二日击伤美造蒋贼喷气战斗机两架。
    二日下午四点五十分，美造蒋贼F—八四型战斗机四架窜入我福建东冲口上空，向海面投弹两枚，随后又窜入黄岐半岛上空，企图俯冲轰炸、扫射。这时，我高射炮部队早已发现蒋贼飞机并做好了战斗准备。当先头的两架蒋贼飞机正向地面俯冲时，各炮兵阵地上的炮手们便以猛烈、准确的炮火，给以迎头痛击。第一架蒋贼飞机被打中机身，第二架被打中了左翼。这两架受伤的蒋贼飞机随即慌乱地把炸弹扔到黄岐半岛附近的海里，向东南方向逃去。另两架蒋贼飞机也连忙跟着前两架被击伤的敌机逃去。
