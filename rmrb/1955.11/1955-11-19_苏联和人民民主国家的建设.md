　　Construction in the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries
　　Soviet Union Building Largest Gas Pipeline
    The Soviet Union is laying one of its largest gas pipelines – 1,500 kilometers long and 720 millimeters in diameter – from the gas fields of Stavropol to Moscow. This is a large-scale construction project. It will cross 329 rivers and mountain ridges, involving 4.7 million cubic meters of earthwork and the welding of 260,000 tons of pipes. Once completed, this gas pipeline will pass through the Ukrainian and Russian Federation republics and dozens of states, providing a large amount of natural gas to dozens of major cities.
    Modern technology is being used in the construction of the gas pipeline. A powerful multi-bucket ditching machine can dig one kilometer of ditch, two meters deep, every four hours. To check the quality of installation and welding, workers use radioactive element devices to inspect the welds; electronic instruments are used to check the quality of the anti-rust coating applied to the outside of the pipes.
　　Leningrad Underground Railway Opens
    The first line of the Leningrad underground railway officially opened on November 15th.
    This is the second underground railway in the Soviet Union. After the first phase of the project was officially completed, a five-day trial run was conducted from November 5th to 9th. During these five days, there were 2,000 trips, and 400,000 passengers were invited to visit and ride the underground train.
    The underground railway runs from the "Moscow" railway station in the city center to the village of Avtovo in the southwest suburbs, passing through busy areas such as the Kirov district, which has the largest population in the city. The surface tram takes one hour to travel from the "Moscow" railway station to Avtovo village, but now the underground train only takes 15 to 17 minutes.
    In order to fulfill the wishes of the working people of Leningrad, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided to name the Leningrad underground railway after V.I. Lenin.
　　Rapid Development of the Electricity Industry in Northern Korea
    Since the armistice, the electricity industry in the northern half of Korea has been rapidly restored and developed. If the energy of the power generation equipment at the time of the armistice in July 1953 is taken as 100, it had already increased to 158 by the end of 1953, and further increased to 248 by the end of 1954. It is expected to increase to 455 by the end of this year.
    In order to implement the national industrialization plan, the northern half of the republic is now extensively conducting surveys of hydroelectric power resources in order to supply more abundant electricity.
    The Jiangjie and Turujiang power stations, which are currently under construction, will soon be generating electricity. At the same time, measures are being taken to provide more electricity for industrial, railway, rural electrification and people's lives.
    The abundant electricity currently produced in the north is not only sufficient to meet the needs of the north but also has a surplus, and it is sufficient to supply the entire Korean people, which is a strong guarantee for the industrialization of Korea and the continuous improvement of people's lives.
　　Romania's Five-Year Plan for Total Industrial Output is 99 Percent Completed
    According to the statistics of the Central Bureau of Statistics of the Council of Ministers of the Romanian People's Republic, as of October 31, the plan for total industrial output of Romania's first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) has been 99 percent completed. Important industrial sectors that completed the Five-Year Plan two to eight months ahead of schedule include oil, natural gas, iron ore, machine manufacturing and metal processing, chemical, electrical, logging, wool weaving, and canned food.
    As a result of the successful implementation of the first Five-Year Plan, Romania's industry has experienced rapid growth. Its total output is now 2.9 times that of 1938. Oil has increased from 6.6 million tons in 1938 to 10.5 million tons, steel from 284,000 tons to 785,000 tons, electricity from 1.1 billion kilowatt-hours to 4.3 billion kilowatt-hours, and coal from 2.8 million tons to 6.3 million tons. Cotton and wool fabrics have increased to approximately two and three times their 1938 levels, respectively.
　　Dimitrov Hydropower Station Generates Electricity
    One of Bulgaria's largest construction projects, the Dimitrov Hydropower Station, has recently been completed and put into production. The rushing waters of the Tundzha River, which crosses central Bulgaria, have been dammed. Near the hydropower station, a new artificial lake has appeared, nine kilometers long and covering an area of 8.6 square kilometers.
    The economic significance of the Dimitrov Hydropower Station is enormous. The water in the reservoir will drive water turbines in two large power stations. It will generate 80 to 100 million kilowatt-hours annually, which is about one-fourth of Bulgaria's electricity generation ten years ago. At the same time, the water in the reservoir can also be used to irrigate nearly 600,000 mu of land.

### 苏联和人民民主国家的建设

　　苏联和人民民主国家的建设 　 苏联建设最大的煤气输送管
    苏联一条最大的煤气管——长达一千五百公里，管子直径达七百二十公厘的煤气输送管，正在从煤气产地斯塔夫罗波尔向莫斯科敷设中。这个建设工程规模巨大。它要穿过三百二十九处河道和山梁，一共要完成四百七十万土方的工程和焊接二十六万吨的管子。这条煤气管建成以后，将通过乌克兰和俄罗斯联邦两个加盟共和国和十几个州，使几十个大城市获得大量的天然煤气。
    煤气管的建设工程是采用现代化的技术进行的。有一种强力的多斗挖沟机每四小时能够挖一公里长、两公尺深的沟。为了检查安装和焊接工程的质量，工人们用有放射性元素的装置来检查电焊的焊缝；利用电子仪器来检查涂在管子外表的防锈涂料的质量。
　  列宁格勒的地下电车道通车
    列宁格勒地下电车道第一条路线已经在十一月十五日正式通车。
    这是苏联的第二个地下电车道。它的第一期工程正式完工后，从十一月五日到九日曾经进行了五天试验性的通车。在五天当中，行车二千次，有四十万乘客被邀请参观并且乘坐了地下电车。
    地下电车道从市中心的“莫斯科”火车站到西南郊的阿夫托沃村，经过城市中人口最多的基洛夫区等热闹地区。从“莫斯科”火车站到阿夫托沃村，地上电车要走一点钟，但是现在地下电车只要走十五到十七分钟就够了。
    苏联最高苏维埃主席团为了满足列宁格勒劳动者的愿望，决定以弗·伊·列宁的名字来命名列宁格勒的地下电车道。
  　朝鲜北部电力工业迅速发展
    停战后朝鲜北半部的电力工业有了迅速恢复和发展。如果把一九五三年七月停战时的发电设备的能量作为一百，它到一九五三年年底时就已经增加到了一五八，到一九五四年年底时更增加到二四八，预料到今年年底时将增加到四五五。
    为了执行国家工业化的计划，共和国北半部现在正在广泛地进行勘测水力发电资源的工作以便供给更丰富的电力。
    现在正在兴建的江界和秃鲁江发电站发电的日期已经不远了。同时，正在采取措施为工业、铁路、农村的电气化和人民的生活提供更多的电力。
    目前在北部生产的丰富的电力不仅能供应北部的需要而有余，而且也足够供给全朝鲜人民，这是使朝鲜工业化和不断提高人民生活的有力保证。
  　罗五年计划工业总产量计划已经完成百分之九十九
    根据罗马尼亚人民共和国部长会议中央统计局的统计，截至十月三十一日为止，罗马尼亚第一个五年计划（一九五一—一九五五年）的工业总产量计划已经完成了百分之九十九。提前两个月到八个月完成五年计划的重要工业部门包括石油、天然气、铁矿、机器制造和金属加工、化学、电器、伐木、毛织、罐头等。
    由于第一个五年计划胜利执行的结果，罗马尼亚的工业获得了迅速高涨。目前它的总产量已经增为一九三八年的二点九倍。石油从一九三八年的六百六十万吨增加到一千零五十万吨，钢从二十八万四千吨增加到七十八万五千吨，电力从十一亿度增加到四十三亿度，煤从二百八十万吨增加到六百三十万吨。棉织品和毛织品分别增为一九三八年的两倍和三倍左右。
　  保季米特洛夫水电站发电
    保加利亚最大的建筑工程之一，季米特洛夫水电站已在最近完工，并投入生产。横贯保加利亚中部的通加河的奔腾河水已被阻挡住了。在水电站的附近，出现了一个九公里长、面积占八点六平方公里的新的人造湖。
    季米特洛夫水电站的经济意义是十分巨大的。水库里的水将带动两个大的发电站里的水轮机。这里每年将发电八千万到一亿瓩时，这个数字约等于十年前保加利亚发电量的四分之一。同时，水库里的水还可以用来灌溉近六十万亩的土地。
