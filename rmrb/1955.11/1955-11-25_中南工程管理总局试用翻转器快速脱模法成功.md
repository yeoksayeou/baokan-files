　　Central South Engineering Management Bureau Successfully Trials Quick Demolding Method with Tilting Device

　　The Concrete Workshop of the Fifth Engineering Department of the Central South Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has recently achieved success in trialing the "Tilting Device" model board, a quick demolding method for prefabricated concrete components created by engineers A.B. Pochkurinko of the Soviet Vosniushiu Construction Company. In the initial trial production of three molds, 230 prefabricated panels were produced in just six days. They fully met the design requirements, with no pitted surfaces or chipped corners, and reduced project costs. Operation was also safe and convenient.

　　The advantage of the quick mold tilting device is that it allows workers to easily flip the prefabricated components and immediately remove the mold. This reduces the two processes of "demolding" and "assembly," thus improving labor efficiency. According to initial trial results, each group (five people) can prefabricate 42 pieces per day, an efficiency increase of over 20% compared to the past. The cost can also be reduced by more than 49% per square meter.

　　Currently, the Central South Engineering Management Bureau has made a summary of the trial production and is preparing to promote it vigorously.

　　中南工程管理总局试用翻转器快速脱模法成功
    建筑工程部中南工程管理总局第五工程处混凝土车间，试用苏联沃新涅休建筑公司工程师彼奇库林科A鲍—琴创造的“翻转器”模型板，预制混凝土构件快速脱模法，最近已获得成功。初步试制三个模板，仅六天的时间，制成了二百三十块预制板。完全符合设计要求，没有麻面脱角现象，并降低了工程造价。在操作上也很安全和方便。
    快速模板翻转器的好处是，便于工人把预制的构件，很轻便地翻转过来，立即脱去模板。它可以减少“拆模”、“拼装”两道工序，因此能提高劳动效率。据初步试制结果，每个小组（五人）每天可预制四十二块，比过去提高效率百分之二十以上。每一平方公尺并可降低成本百分之四十九以上。
    目前，中南工程管理总局已经作了试制总结，准备大力推广。
