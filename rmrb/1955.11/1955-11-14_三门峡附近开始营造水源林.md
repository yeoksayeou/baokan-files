　　Water Source Forest Creation Begins Near Sanmenxia
　　The two counties of Shanxian and Lingbao near Sanmenxia plan to create more than 35,000 mu of water source forest this year. Shanxian and Lingbao counties are located in the Loess hilly area, with loose soil, few trees, and very serious soil erosion. Since liberation, in order to improve this situation, the two counties have successively afforested more than 50,000 mu in the areas with the most serious soil erosion, initially playing a role in maintaining soil and water. This autumn, the two counties held afforestation and soil conservation and forestry representative conferences, planning to create 35,000 mu of water source forest. At present, in addition to a large number of seedlings being cultivated in local nurseries, 200,000 jin of seeds such as oak and purple acacia, and 200,000 seedlings have been successively transported from other places. The afforestation work is in full swing. (Qi Baoyuan)

　  三门峡附近开始营造水源林
    三门峡附近陕县、灵宝两县，今年计划营造水源林三万五千多亩。陕县、灵宝两县处于黄土丘陵地带，土质松散，树木很少，水土流失情况十分严重。解放后，为了改善这种情况，两县已经在水土流失最严重的地方，先后造林五万多亩，初步起了保持水土作用。今年秋季，两县召开了营林保土和林业代表会议，计划营造水源林三万五千亩。现在，除当地苗圃已培育了大批树苗外，已陆续从外地运来了橡树、紫穗槐等种子二十万斤，树苗二十万株。造林工作正在积极进行。（齐保元）
