Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 28th - Nikolai Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and Nikita Khrushchev, Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, arrived in Coimbatore, one of the important industrial centers of South India, in Madras Province, by plane on the morning of the 27th from Bangalore. At the airport, they were welcomed by Sethu Pathi, Minister of Public Works of Madras Province, and representatives of local government and military authorities. Many people holding garlands and national flags gathered at the airport. Six elephants, adorned in festive attire—wearing golden nose rings, blue back cloths, and colorful parasols towering on their backs—welcomed the distinguished guests at the plane exit. As the distinguished guests traveled from the airport to Chitambaram Pillai Park to attend the Coimbatore citizens' welcome rally, the entire seven-mile road was lined with enthusiastically welcoming people, estimated to be over 400,000.

Two hundred thousand citizens of Coimbatore attended the citizens' welcome rally. Representatives of various people's organizations in the city presented garlands to Bulganin and Khrushchev according to traditional etiquette. Bulganin and Khrushchev addressed the attendees.

Bulganin first extended warm and friendly greetings to everyone on behalf of the Soviet people. He said that the Soviet people were pleased that they had established good friendly relations with the great Indian people. This friendship would be a pillar of world peace. The Soviet people, like you, hate war.

Bulganin thanked the city of Coimbatore for its warm hospitality to the Soviet delegation and congratulated the Soviet-Indian friendship.

Khrushchev then spoke, saying that we will consolidate this great friendship between the people of our two countries and the people of all countries who are striving for peace. We hope to consolidate this friendship without harming the people of other countries. We hope that the same peaceful and friendly relations that exist between our two countries will also exist between other countries.

In concluding his speech, Khrushchev shouted, "Long live the eternal fraternal friendship between the Soviet people and the people of the great Republic of India!"

Bulganin and Khrushchev's speeches elicited stormy applause and enthusiastic cheers from the attendees.

After the meeting, the guests traveled to one of India's most scenic areas—the Blue Mountains (Nilgiris), 60 kilometers from Coimbatore. It took the Soviet guests almost five hours to travel along this road, which was adorned with welcome arches and fluttering welcome flags, to reach the Ootacamund hill resort, located in the center of the Blue Mountains, 2,500 meters above sea level. Along the way, the Soviet guests were constantly cheered by Indian farmers. Khrushchev and Bulganin were also invited by the Madras Provincial authorities to visit some agricultural enterprises in the province. They visited a coconut and banana plantation in the Vadama Durai area, where they tasted coconut juice and, at the request of the owner, planted two coconut saplings as a memorial to their visit. Later, Khrushchev and Bulganin visited another coconut plantation and inspected rice paddies.

In the resort town of Ootacamund, located in the heart of the mountains, thousands of residents were waiting for the guests in the square. Warmly welcomed by the residents, Khrushchev and Bulganin proceeded to their prepared residences.

In the afternoon, Bulganin and Khrushchev visited tea and coffee plantations not far from Ootacamund. Later, the Soviet guests also visited the small tea and coffee factories attached to this farm. The guests spent the night of the 27th in Ootacamund. They will fly from Coimbatore to Madras on the 28th.

    布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫访问哥印拜陀
    新华社新德里二十八日电　苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫，在二十七日上午从班加罗尔乘飞机到达南印度重要工业中心之一，马德拉斯省的哥印拜陀城。在机场欢迎贵宾的有马德拉斯省公共工程部长谢特胡帕特希和当地政府和军事当局的代表。许多人手持花环和国旗聚集在机场上。六只大象披着节日的装束——戴着黄金的鼻套，披着蓝色的背衣，背上高耸着五彩罗伞，在飞机出口处欢迎贵宾。当贵宾们从飞机场到只陀姆婆罗姆·比莱公园去参加哥印拜陀市民欢迎大会时，整整七英里长的道路上都站满了热情欢迎的人们，估计在四十万以上。
    出席市民欢迎大会的有二十万哥印拜陀的市民们。这个城市各人民团体的代表按照传统的礼节向布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫献了花环。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫向到会者致词。
    布尔加宁首先代表苏联人民向大家致热烈的友好问候。他说，苏联人民为他们同伟大的印度人民建立了良好的友谊关系而感到高兴。这种友谊将是世界和平的支柱。苏联人民和你们一样仇恨战争。
    布尔加宁感谢哥印拜陀市对苏联代表团的热情招待，并且为苏印友谊祝贺。
    赫鲁晓夫随后发言说，我们将巩固我们两国人民之间和正在争取和平的各国人民之间的这种伟大的友谊。我们希望巩固的这种友谊，并不危害其他国家的人民。我们希望其他各国之间也存在着我们两国之间的那种和平友好关系。
    赫鲁晓夫在结束自己的演说时，高呼苏联人民和伟大的印度共和国人民之间的永恒的兄弟友谊万岁。
    布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫的讲话，引起了到会者暴风雨般的掌声和热烈的欢呼。
    在大会结束以后，客人们前往印度风景最优美的地区之一——离哥印拜陀六十公里的蓝山（尼尔盖里）。苏联客人们在这条到处都搭着欢迎牌楼，飘着欢迎旗帜的路上走了差不多五小时才到达拔海两千五百公尺高的位于蓝山中心的奥塔卡孟德山地疗养地。一路上，苏联贵宾不断受到印度农民的欢呼。赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁还应马德拉斯省当局的邀请，参观了这个省的一些农业企业。他们在瓦达马杜拉伊地区参观了一个椰子和香蕉园，在那里尝了椰子汁，并且应主人的要求，栽了两棵椰子树苗，作为他们访问的纪念。后来，赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁访问了另一个椰子园，并且参观了稻田。
    在位于山区中心的疗养城奥塔卡孟德，几千居民在广场上等候着客人。受到居民热烈欢迎的赫鲁晓夫和布尔加宁前往为他们准备好的住处。
    下午，布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫参观了距奥塔卡孟德不远的茶园和咖啡园。以后，苏联客人们又参观了附设在这个农场的不大的制茶厂和咖啡工厂。客人们二十七日晚上在奥塔卡孟德过夜。他们将在二十八日从哥印拜陀飞往马德拉斯。
