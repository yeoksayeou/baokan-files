　　Good Ways to Improve Rural Market Supply
　　Mu Lan
　　Since late September, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has adopted many effective measures that have greatly changed the supply work in rural markets in Hubei Province.

　　When convening a material supply meeting, the Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative helped staff calculate accounts for the bumper harvest, placement of goods, and purchasing power of the masses. It used practical materials to criticize the prevalent incorrect idea among supply and marketing cooperative staff of "fearing stockpiles but not fearing stockouts." This method of calculating detailed accounts has had a great effect on overcoming conservative thinking, thereby strengthening the confidence of grassroots cooperatives in expanding purchases and completing sales plans.

　　After conducting inventory checks and streamlining operations, many county supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province also convened "three-member" meetings attended by district cooperative directors and incorporating district cooperative purchasing agents, salespersons, and warehouse keepers. At the meeting, the purchasing agents, salespersons, and warehouse keepers first introduced the situation of purchasing, selling, and storing goods, and then explained the responsibilities and interrelationships of the "three members" to eliminate the disconnection between purchasing, sales, and storage. In Jiangling County, the "three-member" meeting allowed for mutual exchange of information. The salespersons talked about the needs of farmers, the purchasing agents talked about the purchasing situation, and the warehouse keepers talked about the inventory situation, so that everyone had a clear picture. Eight district supply and marketing cooperatives in Tianmen County established a system at the "three-member" meeting, delineating the responsibilities of the "three members": if the warehouse has goods that are not transferred to the retail department in time, causing a stockout, the warehouse keeper is responsible; if the warehouse has goods, but the salesperson does not notify the warehouse keeper to ship them, causing a stockout, the salesperson is responsible; if state-owned companies have goods, but the cooperative does not purchase them in time, causing a stockout, the purchasing agent is responsible. They also stipulated that a coordination meeting should be held once a month, a service pledge should be established in the retail department, and a customer feedback book should be set up at the counter.

　　Combining inventory checks and "three-member" meetings, supply and marketing cooperatives in Hubei Province revised and expanded the supply plan for the fourth quarter, increasing the province's fourth-quarter supply plan by more than 20 percent compared to the original. When expanding the supply plan, they also actively organized commodity adjustments between districts through material exchange meetings and visits to state-owned company warehouses, so that commodities could be arranged in a way that better suits the needs of farmers.

　　The Hubei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative's approach of starting with calculating detailed accounts and solving ideological problems of the staff, mobilizing the purchasing agents, salespersons, and warehouse keepers who specifically grasp the business to understand the specific situation of the cooperative's purchasing, sales, and inventory, and then expanding the sales plan and increasing the variety of operations based on these situations is correct. Because by calculating detailed accounts and helping them understand and analyze the specific situation, they realize that the current rural supply work is far from meeting the needs of farmers, prompting them to overcome conservative thinking. The method of convening "three-member" meetings to understand the specific situation of the cooperative's purchasing, sales, and inventory, and clarifying responsibilities is also very important, because this allows them to understand the specific situation of purchasing, sales, and inventory, so that they will not blindly reject or blindly demand goods and cause the phenomenon of warehouse stockpiles and retail department stockouts. Organizing commodity adjustments between districts can avoid stockpiles here and stockouts there due to improper arrangement of commodities. This will enable the supply and marketing cooperatives to expand the supply plan and try to meet the needs of farmers' production and livelihood materials based on the specific situation of the rural market.

　　改进农村市场供应的好办法
　　牟澜
    九月下旬以来，湖北省供销合作社，采取了很多有效措施，使湖北省农村市场的供应工作有了很大转变。
    湖北省供销合作社在召开物资供应会议的时候，采用了帮助工作人员算丰收账、投放账、群众购买力账，用实际材料来批判目前在供销合作社工作人员中普遍的“怕积压不怕脱销”的不正确的思想。这种采用算细账的办法，对克服保守思想的作用很大，因而加强了基层社扩大进货、完成销售计划的信心。
    湖北省不少地区的县供销合作社在进行清仓排队以后，还召集了区社主任并吸收区社的采购员、营业员、仓库保管员参加的“三员”会议。会上先由采购员、营业员、保管员介绍进货、销货和仓库存货的情况，再说明“三员”的责任和相互关系，以消除进、销、存的脱节现象。江陵县在“三员”会议上互相交谈了情况，营业员谈农民的需要，采购员谈采购的情况，保管员谈库存商品情况，使大家心中有数。天门县八个区供销合作社在“三员”会议上订立了制度，划清了“三员”的责任：凡仓库有货没有及时调拨给门市部而造成脱销的，由保管员负责；凡仓库里有货营业员没有通知保管员发货而脱销的，由营业员负责；凡国营公司有货，合作社没有及时进货而脱销的，由采购员负责。他们还规定每一月开一次碰头会，在门市部订立了服务公约，在柜台上设了顾客意见簿。
    结合清仓排队和“三员”会议，湖北省各地供销合作社修订和扩大了第四季度供应计划，使全省第四季度供应计划比原来扩大百分之二十以上。各社在扩大供应计划的时候，他们又通过物资交流会、参观国营公司仓库等办法，积极组织区和区之间的商品调剂，使商品能摆布得更适合农民需要。
    湖北省供销社这种先从算细账、解决工作人员思想问题着手，发动具体掌握业务的采购员、营业员、保管员来摸清社内进货、销售、存货的具体情况，再根据这些情况来扩大销售计划和增加经营品种的做法，是正确的。因为通过算细账、帮助他们了解分析具体情况，使他们认识到目前农村供应工作还远远不能满足农民的需要，促使他们克服了保守思想。召开“三员”会议摸清社内进货、销货、存货的具体情况、分清责任的办法也十分重要，因为这样可使他们了解了进、销、存的具体情况，才不致发生盲目不要或盲目乱要商品和仓库积压门市部脱销的现象。组织区和区之间的商品调剂，才可以避免因商品摆布不合适而造成这里积压那里脱销。才能使供销合作社根据农村市场的具体情况，扩大供应计划，尽量满足农民生产和生活资料的需要。
