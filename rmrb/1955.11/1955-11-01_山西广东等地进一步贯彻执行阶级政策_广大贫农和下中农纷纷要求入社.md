    Shanxi, Guangdong and other places further implement the class policy; vast numbers of poor and lower-middle peasants actively request to join cooperatives

    (Our Dispatch) In Shanxi, Guangdong, Rehe, Qinghai and other places, in the work of carrying out agricultural cooperation planning and establishing agricultural production cooperatives, the class policy of the Party in rural areas has been further implemented, and the vast numbers of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants have actively requested to join cooperatives.

    In the rural areas of Shanxi Province, a mass upsurge of joining cooperatives has been set off. According to incomplete statistics in mid-October, more than 500,000 peasant households in the province have applied to join cooperatives. Among them, more than 164,000 households have been absorbed by just 13,000 old cooperatives. The remaining hundreds of thousands of peasant households have established more than 1,000 new cooperatives, and more than 12,000 are under preparation. In the process of developing agricultural production cooperatives, counties, according to Chairman Mao's report on the question of agricultural cooperation, paid attention to class analysis, giving priority to satisfying the demands of poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants to join cooperatives, and absorbing rich middle peasants who truly voluntarily joined cooperatives. According to statistics from Taigu, Pingding, Yuci and other counties, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants accounted for about 70 percent of the peasant households applying to join cooperatives. In the 202 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Meng County, with more than 4,900 households, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants accounted for 91.4 percent, and upper-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants accounted for 8.6 percent. Therefore, the peasants who joined the cooperatives have high enthusiasm for running the cooperatives and are full of energy in production. Most of the more than 1,000 agricultural production cooperatives newly established in the Xin County Special District this autumn immediately launched autumn production activities after their establishment.

    In Guangdong Province, in the planning and establishment of cooperatives, the vast majority of areas have implemented the Party's class line, first absorbing activists among the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants into the cooperatives. According to the planning results in Shixing County, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants accounted for 85.7 percent of the peasant households absorbed into the cooperatives. In the 255 newly built cooperatives in Conghua County, poor peasants accounted for 66.49 percent, and lower-middle peasants accounted for 28.94 percent. Among the backbone selected for building cooperatives, according to statistics from twelve counties in central Guangdong, poor peasants accounted for 76 percent. In the 3,649 new cooperatives in Huaiji and other six counties, 92.4 percent of the backbone were activists among the poor peasants and lower-middle peasants.

    Recently, in the rural areas of Rehe Province, about 75 percent of the poor peasants outside the cooperatives and about 65 percent of the lower-middle peasants have put forward demands to join the cooperatives. More than 11,000 of these peasants who requested to join the cooperatives have formed more than 620 new agricultural production cooperatives. More households are preparing for various cooperative establishment work. In Lingyuan and Pingquan counties, more than 950 mutual aid teams are preparing to establish cooperatives after the autumn harvest. In Lingyuan County, more than 3,300 other peasant households have signed up and are preparing to join 426 old cooperatives after the autumn harvest. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has made an overall plan for cooperation throughout the province. It is expected that more than 4,700 new cooperatives will be established before the spring ploughing next year. After the completion of this plan, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the province will increase from 28.2 percent of the total number of peasant households to more than 51 percent.

    As of October 25, in Qinghai Province, a total of more than 50,000 peasant households in eleven counties (autonomous counties) and suburban districts in the province's agricultural area have requested to join agricultural production cooperatives. Together with the original 30,000 peasant households who joined the cooperatives, the peasant households who have joined and requested to join the cooperatives account for more than 42 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. Among the peasant households requesting to join the cooperatives, the poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants are the most active. According to statistics from Zhongxing Township in Huangzhong County, Caojia Township in the suburbs of Xining City, and Gaozhai Township in Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, among the 688 peasant households requesting to join the cooperatives, poor peasants and lower-middle peasants accounted for 556 households.

    山西广东等地进一步贯彻执行阶级政策
    广大贫农和下中农纷纷要求入社
    本报讯　山西、广东、热河、青海等地在进行农业合作化规划和建立农业生产合作社的工作中，进一步贯彻执行党在农村中的阶级政策，广大贫农和新、老中农中的下中农纷纷要求入社。
    山西省农村中已掀起群众性的入社热潮，据十月中旬的不完全统计，全省已有五十多万农户申请入社，其中仅一万三千个老社就吸收了新社员十六万四千多户，其余数十万农户已建成新社一千多个，正在酝酿中的还有一万二千多个。在发展农业生产合作社的过程中，各县根据毛主席关于农业合作化问题的报告，注意了阶级分析，尽先满足了贫农和新、老中农中的下中农的入社要求，并吸收真正自愿入社的富裕中农入社。据太谷、平定、榆次等县的统计，贫农和下中农占申请入社农户的百分之七十左右，在盂县新建的二百零二个农业生产合作社的四千九百多户中，贫农和下中农占百分之九十一点四，新、老中农中的上中农占百分之八点六，因此入社农民办社情绪很高，生产劲头很足。忻县专区今秋新建的一千多个农业生产合作社，大部分都在建社后立即展开秋季生产活动。
    广东省在合作化规划和建社中，绝大多数地区都贯彻执行了党的阶级路线，首先吸收贫农和下中农中的积极分子入社。始兴县规划结果，在吸收入社农户中，贫农和下中农占了百分之八十五点七。从化县新建的二百五十五个社中，贫农占了百分之六十六点四九，下中农占了百分之二十八点九四。在挑选出来的建社骨干中，据粤中十二个县的统计，贫农占百分之七十六。怀集等六个县的三千六百四十九个新社中，百分之九十二点四的骨干是贫农和下中农中间的积极分子。
    最近在热河省农村中，社外贫农的百分之七十五左右，下中农的百分之六十五左右提出了入社的要求。这些要求入社的农民，已有一万一千多户组成了六百二十多个新的农业生产合作社。其余更多的农户正在作各种建社的准备工作。凌源、平泉两县有九百五十多个互助组准备在秋收后建社。凌源县另有三千三百多户农民已经报名，准备秋收后分别加入四百二十六个老社。中共热河省委已经作出了全省合作化的全面规划。预计在明年春耕前，将建立新社四千七百多个。这个计划完成后，全省入社的农户将从占农户总数百分之二十八点二增加到百分之五十一以上。
    青海省到十月二十五日为止，全省农业区十一个县（自治县）和市郊区要求参加农业生产合作社的农户共达五万多户。加上原有入社的三万多农户，已经入社和要求入社的农户共占全省农户总数的百分之四十二以上。在要求入社的农户中，贫农和新、老中农中间的下中农最积极。据湟中县中兴乡、西宁市郊曹家乡和互助土族自治县高寨乡三个乡的统计，要求入社的六百八十八户农民中，贫农和下中农占五百五十六户。
