To the Editor:

    On August 16th, the first cooperative of the "Shuguang" (Dawn) Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongzhao Village, Fourth District of Huayin, Shaanxi, expelled a member named Zhao Chunxi. This incident has caused dissatisfaction among many cooperative members.

    Zhao Chunxi originally participated in the earthwork team of the cooperative. In March of this year, one day, the leader of the earthwork team, using the excuse that there were too many wall builders, reduced the number of people in the group by five, including Zhao Chunxi; however, the next day, they newly absorbed a person who did not understand wall building techniques. This person was the son of the accountant, Zhao Youyun; and the accountant Zhao Youyun had always been aligned with the cooperative's deputy director Zhao Shixun and the security committee member Zhao Luowa, being undemocratic towards the members. Therefore, the members had long been dissatisfied with them, calling them the "Three-Horse Link". Zhao Chunxi had opinions about this practice of the earthwork team leader, and talked to the earthwork team leader and deputy director Zhao Shixun several times, but was rebuffed each time. Thus, he "beat the drum and cried injustice," carrying a washbasin and knocking it in the alley while shouting, "Cooperative cadres are undemocratic!"

    This caused a major storm. Deputy Director Zhao Shixun immediately called back all the cooperative members who were in production to a meeting, demanding that Zhao Chunxi be fined a day's worth of work points for those responsible for calling the meeting. After the Party Branch Secretary Zhao Zhihua, who was responsible for consolidating the Shuguang First Cooperative, returned, he also scolded Zhao Chunxi, and labelled Zhao Chunxi as a "saboteur". Afterwards, in several meetings, Zhao Zhihua indirectly scolded Zhao Chunxi. This made Zhao Chunxi feel anxious every day and forced him to request withdrawal from the cooperative. However, Zhao Zhihua adopted a soft-dragging approach, not resolving the issue.

    This dragged on until the busy summer harvest, and Zhao Chunxi's idea of withdrawing from the cooperative had faded. However, after the summer harvest and during the autumn planting, Zhao Chunxi planted more land but was recorded fewer work points, and Zhao Shixun, one of the "Three-Horse Link," was still undemocratic. Therefore, Zhao Chunxi was determined to write an application to withdraw from the cooperative. At this time, ten other cooperative member households also wanted to withdraw from the cooperative because they were dissatisfied with the "Three-Horse Link". Zhao Zhihua decided to use Zhao Chunxi as a "killing the chicken to warn the monkeys", so when the cooperative went to plow Zhao Chunxi's land and was obstructed, he deployed militiamen all over the village, and then convened a meeting of cooperative members announcing "Someone wants to sabotage the agricultural cooperative", saying many threatening words. After the meeting, Zhao Chunxi was called to the township. Zhao Chunxi felt that he had no way to go and, steeling himself, he bumped his head against the gate of the township government, but fortunately he was pulled away by the township clerk.

    After this, a staff member from the county named Yuan Chunyu was sent. He fabricated four "trumped-up" charges against Zhao Chunxi, and convened a meeting of cooperative members on the evening of August 16th, not allowing Zhao Chunxi's family to attend, and decided to expel Zhao Chunxi.

    We believe that Zhao Chunxi's practice of knocking on a washbasin to "cry injustice" was not good; however, the undemocratic work style of the cooperative's leaders was the root cause of this incident and the dissatisfaction of other cooperative members. The decision to expel Zhao Chunxi was wrong. The CCP Huayin County Committee should re-examine this incident.

### 中共华阴县委应该重新处理赵春熙被开除出社的事件

    中共华阴县委应该重新处理赵春熙被开除出社的事件编辑同志：
    八月十六日，陕西华阴四区东赵村曙光农业生产合作社第一社开除了一个名叫赵春熙的社员。这件事引起了很多社员的不平。
    赵春熙原来参加了社里的土工组。今年三月，有一天土工组组长借口打墙人太多，把赵春熙等五个人减去了；但是第二天却新吸收了一个不懂打墙技术的人。这个人是会计赵友云的儿子；而会计赵友云一直和社里的副主任赵世勋、保卫委员赵罗娃扭成一股，对社员不民主，因此社员们很早就对他们不满意，称他们是“三马连环”。赵春熙对土工组组长这种做法有意见，先后几次找土工组组长和副主任赵世勋谈过，都碰了钉子，于是就“鸣鼓喊冤”，提了洗脸盆子在巷子里一边敲、一边喊“社干部不讲民主”！
    这下就引起了一场大风波。副主任赵世勋马上把全社正在生产的社员都找回来开会，要罚赵春熙负责开会的人一晌的工分。负责巩固曙光一社的党支部书记赵志华回来后又找赵春熙来责骂，并且给赵春熙戴了个“破坏分子”的帽子。以后，在几次会议上，赵志华都指桑骂槐地骂赵春熙。弄得赵春熙每日提心吊胆，被迫要求退社。但是赵志华又采取软拖的办法，不给解决问题。
    一直拖到繁忙的夏收，赵春熙退社的念头已经淡了。可是夏收以后种秋，赵春熙种地多而记的工分却少，“三马连环”之一的赵世勋仍然不民主。于是赵春熙下决心写了一张退社的申请书。这时，还有十户社员也因为不满意“三马连环”而要求退社。赵志华就决定拿赵春熙来“杀一儆百”，于是当社里去犁赵春熙的地而受到阻拦后，就在村头巷尾布满了民兵，然后召开社员大会宣布“有人想破坏农业社”，说了很多威胁的话。会后又把赵春熙叫到乡上。赵春熙被逼得感到无路可走，心一横就把头向乡政府的大门上碰去，幸亏被乡文书拉住了。
    在这以后，县上派来一个名叫员春玉的工作人员。他给赵春熙捏造了四条“莫须有”的罪状，在八月十六日的晚上召开社员大会，不让赵春熙一家人参加，就决定将赵春熙开除了。
    我们认为，赵春熙敲脸盆“喊冤”的做法是不好的；但是社里的领导人员作风不民主，却是引起这件事和其他社员不满意的根本原因。开除赵春熙的决定是错误的。中共华阴县委会应该对这个事件重新进行处理。　毛锜　董俊祥
