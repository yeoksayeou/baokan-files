    The State Council Approves Resolution of the National Conference of Principals of Workers' Technical Schools
    Improve the Quality of Teaching in Workers' Technical Schools
    The State Council recently approved the resolution on improving the quality of teaching work made by the first National Conference of Principals of Workers' Technical Schools jointly convened by the Ministry of Labor and various industrial and transportation departments.
    The resolution pointed out: Under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government, and through the efforts of all comrades engaged in workers' technical education, workers' technical schools across the country have developed considerably in recent years, cultivating a batch of new technical forces for the country. However, workers' technical schools still have some shortcomings and problems at present. The most important of these is the lack of a clear understanding that production practice teaching must be the main focus in training technical workers. Teaching work tends to focus on theoretical teaching, neglecting production practice. In addition, political and ideological education in schools is weak, insufficient attention is paid to teaching research, teaching inspection, and the training and improvement of teachers, and relevant departments and dedicated assisting enterprises do not provide enough assistance to schools. The lack of appropriate solutions to the internship equipment and internship workpieces has seriously affected the quality of teaching. In order to improve future teaching work and improve the quality of teaching, the conference resolved:
    1. Actively implement the principle of focusing on production practice teaching. Production practice teaching is the most important part of the teaching work in workers' technical schools and is the foundation for cultivating students' mastery of production skills. Schools must organize students to engage in internships in valuable labor in accordance with the provisions of the teaching plan and teaching syllabus. The source of internship workpieces, in addition to being solved by dedicated assisting enterprises, should also actively strive for processing orders from other enterprises and request that the competent authorities allocate part of the production tasks and organize collaborative processing between schools. It is recommended that the competent authorities designate dedicated assisting enterprises for schools that do not currently have such assistance, based on the setting of their types of work, so that the dedicated assisting enterprises have the responsibility to entrust schools with processing tasks, provide necessary technical information, ensure that students have independent work positions during their production practice in enterprise workshops, and assist schools in training and improving teachers. The equipment in the internship workshops should meet the requirements of classroom teaching and modern technical standards. For schools where internship equipment is insufficient or too old, it is recommended that the competent authorities gradually replenish it and modify the old equipment. Internship teachers should also prepare thorough lesson plans and make good daily teaching plans. In internship teaching, special attention should be paid to labor protection and technical safety education for students, teaching students how to correctly organize work positions, master the latest technical operation methods, and cultivate students' ability to work independently and develop civilized production habits that comply with technical operating procedures. 2. Improve the quality of theoretical lessons and improve teaching research work. While strengthening production practice teaching, schools must correspondingly improve the quality of theoretical teaching. Teachers should carefully prepare lessons and conscientiously make semester teaching plans and lesson plans to ensure correct and systematic teaching. In the teaching process, teachers must pay attention to the close integration of theoretical teaching and production practice, and adopt various methods to cultivate students' ability to think independently and apply theoretical knowledge to practical work. Schools must strengthen intuitive teaching and gradually establish specialized classrooms. In order to improve teaching research work, principals must strengthen the leadership of school affairs meetings and teaching research groups.
    3. Strengthen political and ideological education and mass cultural activities. In order to improve the quality of political courses and eliminate the phenomenon of overly complex and impractical content of political courses in the past, the main content should now be education in patriotism, collectivism, and love for labor. In cities with a large number of workers' technical schools, it is recommended that the local labor administrative departments organize schools to jointly establish teaching research groups for political courses to promptly summarize and exchange experiences and improve teaching effectiveness. Political and ideological education for students should be carried out constantly in collective life and production labor. Because the view of belittling labor is relatively common among students at present, it is even more important to strengthen labor education and conscious discipline education. Therefore, in addition to conducting ideological education regularly in classroom teaching, schools should also organize students' teams, groups, and types of work in production practice labor competitions in a planned way. Schools must also vigorously carry out sports and cultural activities such as singing and dancing in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on "three goods" (good in health, good in study, and good in work) thereby enhancing students' physical fitness, exercising their will, and enriching their lives. Youth League and trade union organizations among students should play a major role in the school's political and cultural education work. Therefore, the conference suggested that the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League strengthen its leadership over the school's Youth League organizations, and suggested that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions establish trade union organizations among students in workers' technical schools and guide their work.
    4. Regularly check the quality of teaching. Schools must regularly check teaching work, especially production practice teaching work, including checking the quality of teachers' teaching, the degree to which students master knowledge and production skills, and the planning of teaching work.
    5. Systematically improve the level of existing teachers and train new teachers. Schools should organize teachers to study Marxism-Leninism theory, strengthen political and ideological education for teachers, and improve their ideological awareness; and constantly adopt methods such as observing teaching, studying the basic knowledge of pedagogy, organizing exhibitions of teaching achievements, and exchanging work experience to continuously improve teachers' professional abilities. And outstanding students should be selected from the school's graduates for further training as the main source of new teachers. At the same time, it is recommended that the competent department equip schools with a certain number of outstanding teachers and select former graduates from enterprises to return to school and gradually improve their teaching ability through teaching internships.
    The resolution finally pointed out: The principal must rely on the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union organizations to do a good job in political and ideological education, face teaching, strengthen unity, conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, work actively, overcome difficulties, and strive to achieve the resolution.

    国务院批准全国工人技术学校校长会议决议
    提高工人技术学校教学质量
    国务院最近批准了劳动部和工业、交通运输各部联合召开的第一次全国工人技术学校校长会议所作出的关于提高教学工作质量的决议。
    决议指出：几年来在党和人民政府的正确领导下，经过全体工人技术教育工作同志的努力，全国工人技术学校已有相当的发展，为国家培养了一批新的技术力量。但工人技术学校当前仍存在着一些缺点和问题，其中最主要的是对于培养技术工人必须以生产实习教学为主的观点不够明确，教学工作多偏重理论教学，忽视了生产实习，加上学校的政治思想教育薄弱，对教学研究工作、教学检查工作和培养、提高教师重视不够，各主管部门和专责协助企业对学校帮助不够，学校的实习设备和实习工件没有得到适当解决等，严重地影响了教学质量。为了改进今后教学工作，提高教学质量，会议决议：
    一、积极贯彻以生产实习教学为主的方针。生产实习教学是工人技术学校教学工作的最主要部分，是培养学生掌握生产技能的基础，学校必须根据教学计划、教学大纲的规定，组织学生在有生产价值的劳动中进行实习。实习工件的来源，除由专责协助企业解决外，并应积极争取其他企业的加工订货和要求主管部门分配一部分生产任务及组织学校间的协同加工。建议主管部门对目前尚无专责协助企业的学校，必须根据其工种的设置，指定专责协助企业，使专责协助企业有责任委托给学校加工任务，供给必要的技术资料，保证学生在企业车间生产实习时有独立的工作位置，及协助学校培养和提高师资等。实习工场的设备应适合课堂教学的要求和现代的技术水平。目前实习设备不足或过于陈旧的学校，建议主管部门逐步予以充实，并将旧的设备加以改装。实习教师还应在充分备课的基础上做好课日授课计划，在实习教学中，应特别注意对学生的劳动保护和技术安全教育，教会学生正确地组织工作位置，掌握最新的技术操作方法，培养学生具有独立工作的能力和遵守技术操作规程的文明生产习惯。二、提高理论课的授课质量和改进教学研究工作。学校在加强生产实习教学的同时，必须相应地提高理论教学质量，教师应认真备课，切实做好学期授课计划和课时授课计划，以求正确地系统地授课。在教学过程中，教师必须注意理论教学同生产实习的密切结合，并采用各种办法，培养学生独立思考和将理论知识运用于实际工作的能力。学校必须加强直观教学，逐步建立专课教室。为了改进教学研究工作，校长必须加强校务会议和教学研究组的领导。
    三、加强政治思想教育和群众文化活动工作。为提高学校讲授政治课的质量，消除过去政治课的内容过于繁杂、不切合实际的现象，今后应以爱国主义、集体主义、热爱劳动的教育为主要内容。在工人技术学校较多的城市中，建议当地劳动行政部门组织学校联合成立政治课的教学研究组，及时总结和交流经验，提高教学效果。对学生的政治思想教育工作，应该是在集体生活和生产劳动中经常不断地进行。由于当前学生中较普遍地存在着轻视劳动的观点，加强劳动教育和自觉纪律教育就更为重要。因此，学校除在课堂教学中经常进行思想教育外，还应有计划地组织学生的班、组和工种间的生产实习劳动竞赛。学校还必须依据毛主席关于“三好”的指示，大力开展体育运动及歌詠、舞蹈等文化活动，从而增强学生体质，锻炼学生意志和丰富学生的生活内容。学生中的青年团和工会组织，在学校的政治文化教育工作中应起重大作用，因此会议建议中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会加强对学校青年团组织的领导，建议中华全国总工会在工人技术学校学生中建立工会组织并指导其工作。
    四、经常地检查教学质量。学校必须经常检查教学工作，特别是检查生产实习教学工作，其中包括检查教员授课的质量，学生掌握知识和生产技能的程度，以及教学工作的计划性。
    五、有计划地提高现有师资水平和培养新师资。学校应组织教师学习马克思列宁主义理论，加强对教师的政治思想教育，提高其思想觉悟；并经常采用观摩教学、研究教育学的基本知识、组织教学成绩展览和交流工作经验等办法，不断提高教师的业务能力。并应从学校毕业学生中，选择优秀的学生继续进一步培养，作为新师资的主要来源。同时，建议主管部为学校配备一定数量的优秀教师，和从企业中选调过去毕业学生回校，经过教学实习，逐步提高其教学能力。
    决议最后指出：校长必须依靠党、团、工会组织，做好政治思想教育工作，面向教学，加强团结，认真学习苏联先进经验，积极工作，克服困难，为实现决议而奋斗。　（新华社）
