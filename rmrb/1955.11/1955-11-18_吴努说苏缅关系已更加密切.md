Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon Dispatch: Burmese Prime Minister U Nu returned to Rangoon on November 16th. U Nu left Rangoon on October 17th for a foreign visit. In addition to the Soviet Union, U Nu also visited India, Afghanistan, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Poland.

On the afternoon of the 15th, U Nu passed through New Delhi on his way back to the country. He told reporters at the airport that relations between the Soviet Union and Burma have become closer. The Soviet Union's purchase of Burmese rice has helped Burma overcome economic difficulties.

A few hours before returning to Rangoon, U Nu told reporters in Calcutta that the most striking impression he had after visiting the Soviet Union was that the Soviet people "earnestly hope for peace and friendship with other countries."

Speaking of the friendly exchanges between the Soviet Union and Burma, U Nu said that some Soviet agricultural experts will soon visit Burma to study the agricultural situation in Burma and draft a detailed plan on "diversifying agriculture" as in the Soviet Union. The conditions in the two countries are different, but the Soviet method can be applied to Burma with some local changes.

　　吴努说苏缅关系已更加密切
    据新华社讯　仰光消息：缅甸总理吴努已经在十一月十六日回到仰光。吴努是在十月十七日离开仰光出国访问的。除了苏联以外，吴努还到了印度、阿富汗、芬兰、瑞典、丹麦和波兰。
    十五日下午吴努在返国途中经过新德里，他在机场对记者们说，苏联和缅甸的关系更加密切了。苏联购买缅甸大米一事帮助了缅甸克服经济困难。
    在回到仰光以前几个小时，吴努在经过加尔各答时对记者说，他访问苏联后的最显著的印象是，苏联人“热切地希望同其他国家和平和友好”。
    吴努在谈到苏缅两国的友好交往时说，一些苏联农业专家不久将访问缅甸，研究缅甸的农业情况，并且草拟一个关于像在苏联那样“使农业多样化”的详细计划。两国的条件是不同的，但是苏联的方法经过局部的改变是能够应用于缅甸的。
