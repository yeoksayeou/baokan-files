　　A Czechoslovakian Factory Directly Refines Steel in Open-Hearth Furnace Using Poor Iron Ore
    The Lenin Heavy Machinery Factory in Czechoslovakia has adopted a new method to solve a long-standing problem in the global metallurgical industry, enabling the direct refining of steel from poor iron ore in open-hearth furnaces without the need for blast furnace ironmaking. The factory's experience proves that steel produced using this method is of the same quality as ordinary steel made from pig iron, while the total smelting time is approximately the same as that required for ordinary pig iron steelmaking. At the same time, this method can reduce costs by two-thirds.
    The process of using this new steelmaking method is not too complicated. The procedure for processing poor iron ore before steelmaking is the same as before blast furnace smelting, first undergoing a beneficiation process to increase the iron content of the poor iron ore from 20-30% to about 80%. Then, 50% to 75% of the refined ore can be mixed with about 25% of pig iron and scrap steel and directly sent into the open-hearth furnace for smelting. During the smelting process, in order for the general steelmaking open-hearth furnace to function as both an ironmaking and a steelmaking facility, it is necessary to create a blast furnace environment within the open-hearth furnace. In the first stage of smelting, when the silicon dioxide impurities in the ore melt and float up, the open-hearth furnace body is automatically tilted to a certain angle to pour out the silicon dioxide slag, in order to avoid the acidic effect of ironmaking affecting the alkaline changes in the open-hearth furnace. In the second stage of smelting, sufficient and appropriate amounts of coke and limestone must be filled into the open-hearth furnace. At this time, the coke and limestone react with the excessive sulfur and phosphorus impurities contained in the poor iron ore to form slag that is removed, and through complex reduction and oxidation processes, the steel can be finally refined.
    The new creation of the Lenin Heavy Machinery Factory in steelmaking technology has aroused great attention in the Czechoslovakian metallurgical industry. Everyone believes that this new steelmaking method is not only of great significance to Czechoslovakia, which has a large amount of poor iron ore, but also of great significance to many countries in the world.

　　捷克斯洛伐克一工厂用贫铁矿在平炉内直接炼钢
    捷克斯洛伐克列宁重型机器工厂，采用一种新方法，解决了全世界冶金界久未解决的问题，使贫铁矿不经过高炉炼铁过程而在平炉内直接炼钢。这个工厂的经验证明，使用这种炼钢方法炼出的钢与普通由生铁炼出的钢的质量并无差别，而全部冶炼时间约等于普通用生铁炼钢所需的时间。同时，用这种方法还可以减低成本三分之二。
    使用这种新炼钢法的过程并不太复杂。在炼钢以前处理贫铁矿的手续也像高炉冶炼前一样，先经过选矿过程，使贫铁矿的含铁率由百分之二、三十提高到百分之八十左右。然后就可以用百分之五十到七十五的精选过的矿石混合约百分之二十五的生铁和废铁直接送入平炉进行冶炼。在冶炼过程中，为了使一般的炼钢平炉既起炼铁作用又起炼钢作用，必须在平炉内创造出高炉的炉内环境。在冶炼中的第一阶段，当矿石中的二氧化矽杂质经过融化而浮起时，就使平炉炉身自动倾斜到一定角度，把二氧化矽的渣滓倾出，以避免炼铁的酸性作用影响平炉中的碱性变化。在冶炼的第二阶段，要把足够和适量的焦炭和石灰石填入平炉，这时由于焦炭、石灰同贫铁矿中所含过多的硫和磷的杂质起了化合作用而变成渣滓被清除出去，并且由于经过复杂的还原和氧化作用，钢就可以最后炼成。
    列宁重型机器工厂在炼钢技术方面的新创造，已经引起了捷克斯洛伐克冶金工业界的巨大注意。大家认为，这种新炼钢法不仅对贫铁矿较多的捷克斯洛伐克有巨大意义，而且对世界许多国家都有着重大意义。　（据新华社讯）
