　　Frequently Commend Advanced Individuals Who Excellently Fulfill National Plans
　　Zhang Qian
    Frequently commending various advanced individuals who fulfill or overfulfill industrial production plans is an important method for newspapers to mobilize the masses to complete national plans. Doing so can powerfully support and promote people's enthusiasm for building socialism, attract the masses to learn from the working spirit and experience of advanced individuals in completing plans, and give play to the propaganda and organizational role of newspapers in industrial construction.

    Not long ago, the "Beijing Daily" reported in a prominent position the deeds of young lathe operators Shi Hongzhi and Shen Qunwang, who, after completing this year's plan, devoted themselves to next year's production tasks. When the "People's Railway" newspaper reported that more than 300 advanced workers, including Le Junde, Wang Xinnian, and Zhang Jinming, had begun work on next year's tasks, it also published an editorial calling on everyone to learn from these advanced individuals. Over the past year, the "Liaoning Daily" has done this relatively frequently and forcefully.

    The "Liaoning Daily" pays attention to commending advanced individuals based on the current problems and needs in the implementation of national plans by various factories and mining enterprises. For example, an important reason why many factories and mining enterprises could not complete the national plan in the first half of this year was the poor quality of products. The newspaper then introduced the advanced deeds of Zhan Shuijing, a lathe operator at the Dalian Shipyard, who had not produced any defective or reworked products in seven and a half years and had overfulfilled the national plan every month. After seeing this report, many workers changed their irresponsible attitude towards product quality, and some even wrote self-criticism articles to the newspaper. In the Liaoning Province's campaign to increase production and practice economy this year, in order to promote workers to comprehensively increase production and practice economy, the newspaper reported the process of Xu Liangui, a technician at the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory, creating advanced technologies for saving steel materials and improving labor productivity; it reported the achievements of Song Fenglin, the workshop director of the Shenyang Wire Rod Factory, in leading employees to improve large rolling equipment and give play to production potential. These propagandas have a positive role in encouraging the masses to complete the national plan. The newspaper's publicity of the advanced deeds of young coal miner Wang Hengcheng from November last year to February this year has a more obvious purpose. In the second half of last year, in many enterprises in Liaoning Province, the labor competition was disconnected from the completion of the plan, and many employees greedily sought novelty and pursued personal inventions and creations, without paying attention to observing labor discipline and operating procedures, so that the national plan could not be completed on time or comprehensively. In response to this production and ideological situation, the newspaper prominently publicized Wang Hengcheng's deeds of not being absent from work even once in the past six years, not having an accident in five years, and overfulfilling the plan every month. The down-to-earth and diligent work attitude that the newspaper focused on commending was exactly what ordinary employees ignored at the time, and it was indispensable for completing the national plan. Therefore, once the newspaper called on everyone to learn from Wang Hengcheng, it immediately received a wide response. After learning Wang Hengcheng's deeds, many coal miners in Benxi changed their attitude towards labor, the attendance rate increased, and accidents decreased.

    In order to establish role models in various fields, the "Liaoning Daily" reported on advanced individuals in various fields. In addition to the advanced individuals mentioned above, it also commended Qi Changyuan, who loved machines and kept them from being damaged, and therefore always completed the plan on time or ahead of schedule; Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande, who carried out frequent labor competitions and brought into play the spirit of mutual assistance in production to complete the production quota ahead of schedule; Chu Yunde, a material number worker who paid attention to saving steel for a long time; and other advanced individuals who emerged in the campaign to increase production and practice economy. It is precisely because the workers and masses in various production positions have different needs that they require advanced individuals in various fields as role models for their own learning. Therefore, such extensive commendation can better meet people's needs. And because of the wide range of commendation objects, this propaganda of the newspaper may be more frequent.

    When the "Liaoning Daily" used advanced individuals to educate the masses, it also publicized that these advanced individuals worked under the same conditions as ordinary people and completed the national plan ahead of schedule. In this way, people can more convincingly understand that as long as they work hard, they can complete and complete the plan ahead of schedule. In the report commending young lathe operators Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande, people can see that they only learned the technology in recent years, and they have been using an old belt lathe for several years. But even under such conditions, because they brought into play the spirit of mutual assistance in production, loved the old equipment and improved the equipment to bring its potential into play, they completed the production quota for four years in two and a half years, and proposed a guarantee to complete the quota for eight years during the five-year plan period. Through this convincing example, the newspaper pointed out to everyone: Zhu Weiqin and Zhang Liande's deeds are outstanding and advanced; but their method of breaking through the quota is nothing special, but anyone can do it. When the newspaper commended Qi Changyuan, an advanced worker who consistently completed the plan on time or ahead of schedule, it also explained to everyone through facts that although he used a belt lathe that was more than 40 years old, he had not produced any defective products in seven and a half years.

    The "Liaoning Daily" can widely and frequently publicize advanced individuals who excellently complete the national plan, which is inseparable from the specific leadership and research of the editorial department on this work. The editorial department requires its personnel to pay attention to the interview and reporting work of new situations and new clues; the editorial department also strengthens its own understanding and research in this regard, and strives to give sufficient evaluation to new things. This makes it possible for advanced individuals and their creations to be reported in a timely manner. For example, not long ago, the employees of the metalworking workshop of the Shenyang Transformer Factory learned from the Soviet experience and launched the "working day without receiving raw materials." After the newspaper reporter discovered it, he believed that the result of implementing it in this workshop for more than a month was only saving more than 300 yuan of raw materials, so he did not intend to carry out a larger propaganda. After research, the editorial department believed that it should not only consider the short-term economic effect. They believed that this initiative could guide employees to carry out mass activities to save raw materials, which not only the machinery industry needs to promote, but also other industries need to promote. They published editorials, news, and articles to vigorously promote this experience. At present, this experience has been promoted in twelve factories in Shenyang and some factories in the Lushun-Dalian area. The reason why advanced individuals can be commended in a timely manner is also related to the newspaper's proactive spirit towards this work. For example, Wang Hengcheng, an advanced individual who has overfulfilled the plan every month for several years, was discovered by the "Liaoning Daily" reporter in in-depth interviews. Initially, some leaders of the Benxi Coal Mine believed that "publicizing Wang Hengcheng has no great effect" and disagreed to be commended as a role model. At this time, the newspaper editorial department took the initiative to propose to the relevant leading organs of the province, and after the relevant leading organs checked and affirmed it, it carried out continuous publicity in the newspaper. These two examples show that it is precisely because the editorial department can attach importance to leading and researching the propaganda work in this regard, and has given timely and active support to advanced individuals, that these advanced individuals have been fully developed in the newspaper.

    However, the "Liaoning Daily" also has some shortcomings in publicizing advanced individuals. According to the "Liaoning Daily" inspection, during the publicity of Wang Hengcheng, many people, including some leading staff of enterprises, believed that Wang Hengcheng's deeds were very ordinary and not worth learning. The newspaper did not criticize this conservative thinking. Obviously, if the "Liaoning Daily" pays attention to combining with carrying out criticism when commending advanced individuals, it will be more conducive to the growth of advanced individuals.

### 经常地表扬卓越完成国家计划的先进人物

　　经常地表扬卓越完成国家计划的先进人物

    经常地表扬完成或超额完成工业生产计划的各种先进人物，是报纸动员群众完成国家计划的一个重要方法。这样做，就能有力地支持和发扬人们建设社会主义的积极性，吸引群众学习先进人物完成计划的工作精神和工作经验，发挥报纸在工业建设方面的宣传作用和组织作用。
    不久以前，北京日报用显著地位报道了青年车工史洪志、沈群旺完成今年计划后投入明年生产任务的事迹。“人民铁道”报在报道乐俊德、王新年、张金铭等三百多先进工人开始做明年工作的时候，又发表社论号召大家学习这些先进人物。一年以来，辽宁日报在这方面作的比较经常和比较有力。
    辽宁日报注意根据当前各厂矿企业执行国家计划中的问题和需要，来表扬先进人物。例如，今年上半年许多厂矿企业中不能完成国家计划的一个重要原因，是产品的质量低劣。报纸就介绍了大连造船公司车工詹水晶七年半没出过废品返工活，月月超额完成国家计划的先进事迹。不少工人看到这一报道后，改变了自己对待产品质量不负责任的态度，有的人还给报纸写来了自我检查的文章。在辽宁省今年开展的增产节约运动中，报纸为了推动工人全面地增产节约，报道了沈阳风动工具厂技术员徐连贵创造节约钢料和提高劳动生产率的先进技术的经过；报道了沈阳线材厂车间主任宋凤林带动职工改进大压延设备，发挥生产潜力的成就。这些宣传对鼓舞群众完成国家计划有积极的作用。报纸从去年十一月到今年二月关于青年采煤工人王恒成的先进事迹的宣传，更具有比较明显的目的性。去年下半年在辽宁省的不少企业中，劳动竞赛同完成计划脱节，不少职工贪新图大地追逐个人的发明创造，不注意遵守劳动纪律和操作规程，以致国家计划不能按时完成或全面完成。报纸针对这种生产和思想状况，突出地宣传了王恒成六年来没缺过一次勤，五年中没出过一次事故，月月超额完成计划的事迹。报纸所着重表扬的这种老老实实、勤勤恳恳的劳动态度，正是当时一般职工所忽视，而又是完成国家计划所不可少的。因此一旦报纸号召大家学习王恒成，就立时得到了广泛的响应。本溪的采煤工人学习王恒成的事迹之后，许多人对待劳动的态度有所转变，出勤率提高了，事故也减少了。
    为了树立各方面的榜样，辽宁日报报道了各方面的先进人物，除了上面所谈到的一些先进人物外，还表扬了爱护机器使它不受伤，因而一贯按时或提前完成计划的齐长源；开展经常的劳动竞赛，在生产中发挥互助精神提前完成生产定额的朱维勤和张连德；长期注意节约钢材的号料工人初允德；以及增产节约运动中所涌现出来的其他一些先进人物。正因为在各种生产岗位上的工人群众有着不同的需要，他们要求有各方面的先进人物作为自己学习的榜样。因此像这样进行比较广泛的表扬，能够更多地满足人们的需要。而由于表扬对象的广泛，报纸的这一宣传也有可能做到比较经常。
    辽宁日报用先进人物教育群众的时候，还宣传了这些先进人物是在同一般人相同条件下工作而提前完成国家计划的。这样，就能使人们更加信服地了解，只要自己努力，就可以完成和提前完成计划。在表扬青年车工朱维勤和张连德的报道中，人们可以看到，他们是在最近几年中才学到技术的，而几年来他们又一直是使用着一台老旧的皮带车床。但就是在这样的条件下，由于他们在生产中发挥互助精神，爱护旧有设备并改进设备使它的潜力得到发挥，就在两年半的时间内完成了四年的生产定额，并提出了在五年计划期间完成八年定额的保证。报纸通过这个富有说服力的事例，向大家指出：朱维勤和张连德的事迹是突出的、先进的；可是他们突破定额的方法，却没有什么特殊，而是任何人都可以作到的。报纸在表扬一贯按时或超额完成计划的先进工人齐长源的时候，也通过事实向大家说明，他虽然使的是已经有四十多年寿命的皮带大车床，却在七年半当中没出过废品。
    辽宁日报能够比较广泛而经常地宣传优越完成国家计划的先进人物，这同编辑部对这一工作的具体领导和研究是分不开的。编辑部要求它的人员注意对新情况新线索的采访和汇报工作；编辑部也加强自己在这方面的了解和研究，并努力对新事物给以足够的估价。这就有可能使先进人物和他们的创造及时被报道出来。例如不久以前，沈阳变压器厂金工车间的职工们学习了苏联的经验，发起了“不领原材料工作日”。报纸记者发现后，认为在这个车间实行一个多月的结果，只节约了三百多元的原材料，因此不准备作较大的宣传。编辑部经过研究，认为不能只从短时间的经济效果上去考虑。他们认为这个倡议能够引导职工进行群众性的节约原材料的活动，不仅机械工业需要推行，其它产业也需要推行。就发表社论、新闻和文章，大力提倡了这个经验。目前这个经验已经在沈阳的十二个工厂和旅大市的一些工厂中得到推广。先进人物所以能及时得到表扬，也同报纸对待这一工作的主动精神有关系。例如，王恒成这个几年来月月超额完成计划的先进人物，就是辽宁日报记者在深入采访中发现的。最初本溪煤矿的某些领导人员认为“宣传王恒成没有什么大作用”，不同意作为榜样加以表扬。报纸编辑部这时又主动向省的有关领导机关提出，经有关领导机关检查肯定后，在报上作了连续的宣传。这两个例子说明，正是由于编辑部能够重视领导和研究这一方面的宣传工作，对先进人物及时而主动地进行了支持，才使得这些先进人物在报上得到比较充分的发扬。
    但是辽宁日报在宣传先进人物中，也还有一些缺点。据辽宁日报检查，在宣传王恒成这个先进人物期间，许多人包括一些企业的领导工作人员在内，都认为王恒成的事迹很平凡，不值得学习。对于这种保守思想，报纸却没有进行批评。很明显，辽宁日报如果在表扬先进人物的时候，注意同开展批评结合起来，那就会更有利于先进人物的成长。
