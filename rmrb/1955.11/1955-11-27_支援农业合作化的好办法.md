　  Good Ways to Support Agricultural Cooperativization
    Some staff members in government agencies, military units, and enterprises whose families are in rural areas do not pay attention to educating and encouraging their family members in rural areas to participate in agricultural production cooperatives, but instead send them large amounts of money. As a result, some family members of these staff members are not actively participating in labor, are not actively joining cooperatives, and are hesitant and wavering in the cooperativization movement. Some individuals even engage in exploitative behaviors such as lending money at interest and hiring labor. This situation has created a negative impact among the farmers.

    In order to solve this problem, the General Office of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of the party committee secretaries from various agencies of the autonomous region's Party, government, and military, as well as the Hohhot Municipal Committee, to examine the learning situation of staff members on the issue of agricultural cooperativization. It also proposed that the Party branches of each agency mobilize Party members, Youth League members, and all staff members with families in rural areas to write letters to their families, conduct socialist education for them, and mobilize their family members to actively participate in the agricultural cooperativization movement. The method of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in mobilizing staff members from Party, government, military agencies and enterprises with families in rural areas to write letters to their families, encouraging their family members in rural areas to actively participate in the cooperativization movement, is a good way to actively support the cooperativization movement and is worthy of emulation by government agencies, military units, and enterprises in various cities.

　  支援农业合作化的好办法
    机关、部队、企业中有些家在农村的工作人员，不注意教育和鼓励在农村的家属参加农业生产合作社，只是大批地给他们寄钱。这样，有些工作人员家属就不积极参加劳动，不积极参加合作社，在合作化运动中犹豫动摇，个别的甚至有放债、雇工等剥削行为。这种情形已经在农民中造成了不好的影响。
    为了解决这个问题，中共内蒙古自治区委员会办公厅，最近召集自治区党、政、军各机关及呼和浩特市机关党委书记开会，检查了各机关工作人员对于农业合作化问题的学习情况，还提出了由各机关党支部发动家在农村的党员、团员及全体工作人员给家里写信，向家庭进行社会主义教育，动员家属积极参加农业合作化运动。中共内蒙古自治区委员会发动党、政、军机关和企业部门家在农村的工作人员给家里写信，动员自己在农村的家属积极参加合作化运动的办法，是一种积极支持合作化运动的好办法，值得各个城市的机关、部队和企业仿效。
