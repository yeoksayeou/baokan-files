Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 6th: An Egyptian Embassy spokesman in Washington said on November 5th that the Egyptian Ambassador to the United States, Hussein, lodged a strong protest on November 5th during a meeting with George Allen, Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern, South Asian, and African Affairs. Hussein told Allen that he was very dissatisfied with the way the US State Department had summoned him.

The spokesman said that the US State Department had informed journalists on the evening of the 4th about inviting Hussein before notifying him. Hussein said that this was the most undiplomatic way to summon an ambassador for consultations.

Allen gave Hussein a US State Department statement regarding Israeli-Egyptian hostilities. In this statement, the United States accused both Egypt and Israel of violating the armistice agreement. Hussein also protested against this US attitude.

    埃及驻美大使抗议美国国务院的无理态度
    新华社六日讯  华盛顿消息：埃及驻美国大使馆发言人五日说，埃及驻美国大使侯赛尼五日在会见美国负责近东、南亚和非洲事务的助理国务卿乔治·艾伦时提出了强硬的抗议。侯赛尼向艾伦说，他对美国国务院召见他的方式感到非常不满意。
    发言人说，美国国务院在未通知侯赛尼之前在四日晚间就把关于邀请他的事告诉了新闻记者。侯赛尼说，这是召见一个大使来进行商谈的最不合外交礼节的方式。
    艾伦曾把一份美国国务院关于以色列—埃及敌对行动的声明交给侯赛尼。美国在这个声明中指责埃及和以色列双方都破坏了停战协定。侯赛尼对于美国的这种态度也提出了抗议。
