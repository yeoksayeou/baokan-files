A special column.

(Our correspondent in) Shuajing Temple, November 10th. The Chengdu-Aba Highway, running through the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, was fully opened to traffic today. A grand ceremony was held in Shuajing Temple, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, to celebrate the full opening of the highway. Among those attending the ceremony were Yu Jitang, Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, Li Xuehou, representative of the Chengdu Military Region, and responsible persons of the CPC Maoxian Prefectural Committee, the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Sichuan Province, the Maoxian Military Sub-district of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and over two thousand people from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Shuajing Temple. Dozens of military engineers, civilian workers, and model heroes who participated in the road construction were also invited to attend the conference.

The conference began with a moment of silence for the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the construction of the Chengdu-Aba Highway, and awards were presented to those who made contributions to the road construction. Subsequently, Luo Zhenhai, Deputy Director of the Chengdu-Aba Highway Project Office of Sichuan Province, reported on the construction process of the Chengdu-Aba Highway.

Yu Jitang, Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, spoke at the meeting. He congratulated the road construction personnel on behalf of the Sichuan Provincial People's Committee and encouraged the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region to work hard to build a prosperous and happy Tibetan Autonomous Region under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Suo Guanying, Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Government, also spoke, expressing on behalf of the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region their heartfelt gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for their concern for the people of all ethnic groups in the autonomous region, and expressing their condolences to the road construction personnel. Finally, the conference adopted a telegram of tribute to Chairman Mao.

After the meeting, a ribbon-cutting ceremony was held to mark the opening of the highway. After Yu Jitang, Deputy Governor of Sichuan Province, cut the colored silk, a total of more than 30 trucks and cars loaded with cloth, tea, salt, and grain left Shuajing Temple amidst the sound of firecrackers and the cheers of people of all ethnic groups, heading towards the grasslands.

The construction of the Chengdu-Aba Highway began in 1951. The highway is more than 500 kilometers long. Except for the 50-plus kilometers from Chengdu to Guanxian, which were built earlier, more than 400 kilometers of new routes were constructed. The construction of the new routes was extremely difficult, as they had to pass through mountains such as Mount Zhegu and Mount Ayila, which are more than 4,000 meters above sea level, cross the Minjiang River and the Zagunao River, which are turbulent and rushing, and finally pass through the vast grasslands. This area is the snow-capped mountains and grasslands that the Red Army passed through during the Long March twenty years ago. The Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and civilian workers who were responsible for the road construction, with the active support of the people of all ethnic groups in northwestern Sichuan and under the guidance of Soviet experts, after four years of arduous struggle, finally built the highway to Aba, a major town in the center of the grasslands on the border of Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai.

　　成都到阿埧公路修筑完工全线通车
    本报刷经寺十日电　贯穿四川省藏族自治区境内的成（都）阿（埧）公路已在十日全线通车。四川省藏族自治区首府刷经寺同日举行庆祝全线通车典礼大会。参加大会的有四川省副省长余际唐、成都军区代表李学厚以及中共茂县地委、四川省藏族自治区人民政府、中国人民解放军茂县军分区的负责人和刷经寺各族各界人士二千多人。筑路军工、民工及模范功臣数十人也应邀出席了大会。
    大会首先向在修筑成阿公路中牺牲的烈士致哀，并向筑路中有功人员发奖。接着，四川省成阿公路工程处副处长罗振海报告了成阿公路修筑经过。
    四川省副省长余际唐在会上讲话，他代表四川省人民委员会向筑路人员表示祝贺，并勉励自治区各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，为建设繁荣幸福的藏族自治区而努力。自治区人民政府副主席索观瀛也讲了话，他代表自治区各族人民向中国共产党和毛主席对自治区各族人民的关怀表示衷心的感谢，并对筑路人员表示慰问。大会最后通过了给毛主席的致敬电。
    大会结束后即举行了通车剪彩仪式，由四川省副省长余际唐剪落彩绸后，满载布匹、茶叶、盐巴、粮食的货车及大小汽车共三十多辆，在鞭炮声和各族人民欢呼声中离开刷经寺向草地开去。
    成阿公路在一九五一年开始修筑，全长五百多公里，其中除成都到灌县的五十多公里是早建的以外，新建路线有四百多公里。新建线路工程是非常艰巨的，它要通过拔海四千公尺以上的鹧鸪山、阿依拉山等山岭，跨过湍急奔流的岷江、杂谷脑等河流，最后还要穿过辽阔的草地。这一带是二十年前红军长征经过的雪山草地。担任筑路的中国人民解放军战士们和民工们，在川西北各族人民的积极支援下，在苏联专家的指导下，经过四年来的艰苦奋斗，终于把公路修到川、甘、青边境草地中心的重镇阿埧。
