　　Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: China's industrial sector is supplying more agricultural machinery to rural areas year by year. From January to October this year, supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels supplied more than 400,000 double-wheeled double-furrow plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows, 100,000 waterwheels, and more than 250,000 sets of various pesticide application machines to various regions. It is estimated that this year, industrial sectors across the country, through supply and marketing cooperatives alone, will supply farmers with 15 percent more new-style animal-powered farm implements (including waterwheels) than the total supplied in the past three years.
    This year, the machinery industry is manufacturing more than a dozen major types of machinery for cultivation, irrigation, animal feeding, and pesticide application. Among them, the production of double-wheeled double-furrow plows and double-wheeled single-furrow plows will reach 580,000 units, an increase of more than tenfold compared to 1954. This year, the national plan is to produce more than 51,000 three-tooth cultivators. The large number of ten-row and twelve-row seeders produced by various factories this year are very suitable for sowing crops such as barley, wheat, and soybeans. The industrial sector also manufactured more irrigation machinery such as water pumps and waterwheels this year than last year, with the output of waterwheels increasing by more than 1.2 times compared to last year. Among the pesticide application machines manufactured by the machinery industry this year, there is a sprayer equipped with double-pipe joints, which can increase the spraying area by one time in the same amount of time compared to the previous single-pipe joint sprayers. The machinery industry also produced a large number of walking plows suitable for mountain cultivation and paddy field plows suitable for paddy field cultivation, as well as disc harrows, spike-tooth harrows, rocker arm harvesters, threshers, peanut shellers, small diesel engines, and boiler-tractor machines for cultivation and power.
    This year, China's machinery industry also produced and trial-manufactured many types of tractor-towed farm implements for state-owned farms and machine tractor stations, including grain combine harvesters, five-furrow plows, fertilizer spreaders, universal cultivators, forty-eight-row seeders, four-row cotton seeders, seed selectors, and mowers, several of which have never been manufactured in China before.

　　工业部门供应农村的农业机械逐年增多
    据新华社十二日讯　我国工业部门供应农村的农业机械一年比一年增多。今年一月到十月，由各级供销合作社供应给各地的农业机械，就有双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁四十多万部，水车十万部，各种农药器械二十五万多架。预计今年全国工业部门单是通过供销合作社供应农民的新式畜力农具（包括水车），就将超过过去三年供应总数的百分之十五。
    今年机械工业制造的耕作、灌溉、饲养、农药等方面的机械主要的共有十几种。其中双轮双铧犁和双轮单铧犁的产量将达到五十八万部，比一九五四年增加了十多倍。今年全国计划生产的三齿耘锄共有五万一千多部。各工厂今年生产的大批十行和十二行播种机，很适宜播种大麦、小麦、大豆等作物。今年工业部门制造的水泵、水车等灌溉用的机械也比去年增多，其中水车的产量比去年增加了一点二倍以上。今年机械工业部门制造的农药器械中，有一种装有双管接头的喷雾器，它在同样的时间内比过去单管接头的喷雾器的喷射面积能增加一倍。机械工业部门还生产了大批适合山地耕作的步犁和适合水田耕作的水田犁，以及圆盘耙、钉齿耙、摇臂收割机、脱谷机、花生脱皮机、小型柴油机、锅驼机等耕作和动力用的机械。
    我国机械工业今年还为国营农场和机器拖拉机站生产和试制了许多种拖拉机牵引的农具，主要的有谷物联合收割机、五铧犁、施肥机、万能中耕机、四十八行播种机、四行棉花播种机、选种机和割草机，其中好几种是我国过去没有制造过的。
