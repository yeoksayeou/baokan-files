From a nationwide perspective, the high tide of cooperativization has arrived. Does this mean that every rural village can simply not work, and the cadres can just keep their hands in their sleeves, sitting and waiting for the high tide to arrive? This question seems laughable; who would think like that? According to readers' letters, in Tu Zhong Township of the Sixth District of Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, and Xia Ci Township of Xiajiang County, there are comrades who are sitting and waiting for the high tide. They believe that the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement has arrived, the broad masses of peasants will actively request to join the cooperatives, and the Party organization can stop doing political and ideological work. As a result, facts have educated these comrades. Although the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement has arrived in various places one after another, these places are still deserted, and few peasants have signed up to join the cooperatives. In Tu Zhong Township of the Sixth District of Yongxin County, a mutual aid team of twenty-two households preparing to transition to a cooperative had only four households applying to join. In Xia Ci Township of Xiajiang County, twenty-nine households should have signed up, but only eleven households did.

This precisely illustrates that if the Party's leadership work is not done well, even if there are conditions for a high tide, a high tide will not appear.

    坐等高潮等不来
    从全国范围来说，合作化的高潮是来到了。是不是说，每一个农村就可以不作工作，干部只要把手揣在袖筒里，就可以坐着等待高潮到来呢？这个问题看起来似乎提得很可笑，谁还会这样想呢？据读者来信反映，江西省永新县六区涂中乡和峡江县下茨乡就有这种坐等高潮的同志。他们认为：农业合作化运动的高潮到来了，广大农民会主动要求入社，党组织可以不再做政治思想工作了。结果，事实教育了这些同志。尽管各地农业合作化运动高潮先后到来了，但是这些地方还是冷清清的，农民报名入社的很少。永新县六区涂中乡一个准备转社的二十二户的互助组，却只有四户申请入社。峡江县下茨乡应该有二十九户报名入社，但是只有十一户报名。
    这正说明了如果党的领导工作做得不好，即使有高潮的条件，也不会出现高潮。
