    Actively and systematically carry out the agricultural cooperation movement
    People's Transformation
    An Gang
    The high tide of agricultural cooperation has caused tremendous changes in the countryside. "Listen to Chairman Mao and take the socialist road" is the universal cry. Outside the waiting room of the Baoding Railway Station, I met a farmer from Yuci County, Shanxi Province, who came to Baoding to sell pears. He said cheerfully and loudly, "I won't come next time, I'm going back to join the cooperative." "For these pear trees, I pondered for a whole year, whether it's better to join the cooperative or not? Yuci County produces good fruit, and having pears means having pocket money. But it was this little bit of pocket money that kept me from joining the cooperative for a year." This farmer has now figured it out, he sees that after joining the cooperative, the cooperative can give him more pocket money. Therefore, he said, "All the neighbors in the village are listening to Chairman Mao and vigorously increasing production, it's too boring for me to be alone in a small mountain ditch."

    The most intense ideological change is among a small number of Communist Party members who have not firmly established the Party's position, and therefore hold erroneous attitudes towards the agricultural cooperation cause.

    At the experience exchange meeting of agricultural production cooperatives in the four districts of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, people welcomed a Communist Party member's self-criticism with warm applause. This person's name is LÃ¼ Leshun, the director of a newly established cooperative in Beiliang Village, Fourth District, Xingtai County. The title of his report was: "I thought about it for three years before I figured it out."

    "I am a liberated peasant, the Party and Chairman Mao gave me a good life, I have twenty or thirty mu of land, an ox, and I can sell some surplus grain every year." "During the land reform, I was an activist, and after the land reform, my work wasn't the most backward either. But I had one problem: I was unwilling to engage in agricultural production cooperatives. For three whole years, I kept away from cooperatives. The county party secretary once said to me: 'Let's start a cooperative!' I said, 'No, even families are splitting up, how can so many people be together?' To avoid starting a cooperative, I joined a mutual aid team every year, and I joined the most backward mutual aid team. I myself didn't work actively in the mutual aid team, afraid that if the mutual aid team did well, I would have to 'transfer to a cooperative'. This year, the socialist wave came, and the masses forced me to start a cooperative, everyone pushed me to do it; at first, I said, I don't object to joining the cooperative, but don't ask me to be the director, I can't read, I'm afraid of 'laboring my brains'. Everyone was enthusiastic, and a cooperative with sixty households was quickly established. I said to everyone, don't elect me as the director, but everyone still elected me. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep for several nights, how could I lead! You see, everyone is together, this one is talking, that one is asking, this one is crying, that one is laughing, what should I do? After Chairman Mao's instructions came down, I figured it out. I am a Communist Party member, I joined the Party in 1946, how can I be so selfish? I thought to myself: You are a Communist Party member, everyone trusts you, if you don't lead, are you going to let the landlords do it? No, as a party member, the idea of 'not being willing to pull the cart' (meaning serving the people) is wrong. Agricultural production cooperatives are a bridge to socialism and a happy life, we have to do it even if we turn twenty-four circles. I have since resolved to listen to the instructions from higher levels, learn from the old cooperatives, and definitely run the cooperative well."

    Wherever cooperation is reaching a high tide, people's new ideas are growing rapidly. The poor and lower-middle peasants who join the cooperative openly and firmly say: We are of one mind, we have no worries, we are heading straight for socialism; Chairman Mao relies on us, aren't we going to compete for a better life?

    Some individual households are calculating, and some have already calculated. In the past, some people regarded "starting a cooperative" as "staying up late" (meaning holding meetings) and "empty talk", "it won't succeed". Now their views have changed. I listened to a lot of people talk, and their opinions are: First, individual farming can't afford a double-wheeled double-furrow plow in a lifetime; the cooperative can buy a double-furrow plow together today, and it will definitely be able to use a tractor in the future; individual farming can't compete with a double-furrow plow, and it will be even less able to compete with a tractor in the future. Second, if farmers want to be prosperous, the land must have "fertility", individual farming can't accumulate a lot of manure; the cooperative makes manure and buys fertilizer, hauling it to the fields in large carts, there is enough fertilizer, and it is applied in a timely manner, how can individual farming compare? Third, individual farming can't buy one or two waterwheels in a lifetime, but the cooperative increases fifty a year (Wozhuang, Xingtai); repairing canals, repairing beaches, and digging rivers all require manpower, the cooperative not only has people, but also has organization, whatever you want to do, you can do it. Fourth, individual farming has to be subject to the land, the land tells you what to plant, and you have to plant it; the state's planting plan can't be completed, and crops with large profits can't be planted; the cooperative solves these problems.

    These opinions reflect the changes in the thinking of many individual farmers. They see and believe in the great power of organizing and taking the socialist road. The problem now is: "Joining the cooperative is a must, when is the best time to join?" The increasingly turbulent socialist revolution in the countryside and Chairman Mao's instructions are helping them to make up their minds. Some people's conclusion is: It is better to join now than to join in the future; the reason is that if you join now, you will become an old member in two years, and you will be politically honored. Of course, the main thing is to see that the economic strength of the cooperative is growing day by day, and it has fertilizer and new agricultural tools, large investment, and increased production; if you join in two years, your land fertility will not keep up, and you will have to pay money, which is not worthwhile.

    On this basis, we see an increasing number of farmers in the countryside demanding to join and start cooperatives. They actively connect with cooperative farmers, strive to accumulate fertilizer, exchange for large livestock, and make various preparations. They call this "presenting a gift for joining the cooperative," which is also a sign of sincerity. In many places, farmers are asking Communist Party members and cadres to come out to lead the establishment and expansion of cooperatives. This demand is increasing.

    How to solve this problem?

    Most areas are solving it well, such as Qianluzi Village in Xingtai County. Of the 99 households in the village, except for two landlord and rich peasant households, only two farmers have not yet joined the cooperative. The cooperative members said: These two households don't get along well with people, and they haven't figured it out yet. It won't be good if they come in all of a sudden. Let them stay outside for a period of time, let's try with them. This is in line with the actual situation.

    However, in individual places, the development of cooperatives is still lagging behind the demands of farmers (poor peasants and lower-middle peasants). This situation once occurred in Dawujiazhuang, Xingtai. This is a backward village. Of the 140 households in the village, a cooperative was established last year and collapsed. This year, poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead in establishing a cooperative with 40 households. The class situation in the village is: poor and lower-middle peasants account for 66.6% of the total number of farmers, upper-middle peasants account for 27%, and landlords and rich peasants account for 6.4%. The poor and lower-middle peasants who have joined the cooperative account for a very small part of the existing households. Is it true that all individual farmers are unwilling to join the cooperative? According to the director of the village people's committee, the masses are rushing to join the cooperative, and they go to the boundary every day to study the crops of cooperatives in the surrounding villages. The wheat in the Xiaowujiazhuang cooperative averaged 250 jin this year, but the wheat in Dawujiazhuang averaged only 190 jin because there was no cooperative organization. This specific number deeply impressed the superiority of the cooperative on the minds of the farmers and became the ideological basis for the farmers to demand to join and build cooperatives. Why not accept more volunteers into the cooperative? One member of this cooperative said: "Our cooperative cannot be a long stream, it is always open, you have to wait another year to join." Another member said: "We established a cooperative in the past, you didn't join, now you regret it, you are trying hard to get in, we have to wait and see, we have to investigate and see if you are genuine." Yes, before accepting each farmer, we must review them in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, proceed cautiously, and never violate the principle of voluntariness, so that farmers have ample room for consideration, and do not force them to pull them in. However, in areas where the conditions for the great development of cooperatives are already in place, neither should a closed-door attitude be adopted, nor should a wait-and-see approach be adopted across the board. This autumn and winter, cooperatives are conducting distribution work, which is a great review of the victorious achievements of the cooperatives. It will arouse the enthusiasm of more poor and lower-middle peasants to join the cooperative. For those farmers who truly voluntarily demand to join the cooperative, a welcome attitude should be adopted, which is beneficial to the entire agricultural socialist transformation cause.

    We must see the ideological changes of farmers, especially poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, in the high tide of agricultural cooperation, and we must rush to the front to meet and lead this change, instead of looking at the problem mechanically.

    As for those farmers who have no desire to join the cooperative? The Central Committee instructed us: "We should use the superiority of the cooperative to influence them, let them watch for a while longer, and absorb them into the cooperative after their level of consciousness has been raised." Rural party organizations and cooperatives in many areas have implemented this correct policy. Some wealthy middle peasants who once said "as long as you insist on voluntariness, I will always do as I please" have now also undergone ideological changes. According to their estimates, this time of "great development," it will always be their turn first, they waited and waited; however, no one came to "mobilize" them, these people were surprised. A wealthy middle peasant who withdrew from a cooperative in Zhangjiaying said: "When I was in the cooperative, I had to attend meetings, I didn't sleep a full night; after I withdrew from the cooperative, I haven't been able to sleep these days." It turned out that they were thinking about the cooperative's "framework" (meaning overall planning) day and night. The cooperative increased double-furrow plows, purchased fine fertilizer, added waterwheels... Every daily development stirred their hearts. They saw the great tide of cooperation, and therefore affirmed: "Society (meaning socialism) is the main road, everyone has to take it," "people let us be voluntary, we have to make up our minds." Now, many people hope that people in the cooperative will often go to "mobilize" them, tell them the policies, and help them open their minds. In individual places, there is a cold or even sarcastic phenomenon towards some wealthy middle peasants, such as calling them "old singles," which is inappropriate. We are not absorbing these people for the time being because they have not yet reached true voluntariness. We should educate them, use the superiority of the cooperative to influence them, and not isolate them.
