    Actively and systematically carry out the agricultural cooperation movement
    People's Transformation
    An Gang
    The high tide of agricultural cooperation has caused tremendous changes in the countryside. "Listen to Chairman Mao and take the socialist road" is the universal cry. Outside the waiting room of the Baoding Railway Station, I met a farmer from Yuci County, Shanxi Province, who came to Baoding to sell pears. He said cheerfully and loudly, "I won't come next time, I'm going back to join the cooperative." "For these pear trees, I pondered for a whole year, whether it's better to join the cooperative or not? Yuci County produces good fruit, and having pears means having pocket money. But it was this little bit of pocket money that kept me from joining the cooperative for a year." This farmer has now figured it out, he sees that after joining the cooperative, the cooperative can give him more pocket money. Therefore, he said, "All the neighbors in the village are listening to Chairman Mao and vigorously increasing production, it's too boring for me to be alone in a small mountain ditch."

    The most intense ideological change is among a small number of Communist Party members who have not firmly established the Party's position, and therefore hold erroneous attitudes towards the agricultural cooperation cause.

    At the experience exchange meeting of agricultural production cooperatives in the four districts of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, people welcomed a Communist Party member's self-criticism with warm applause. This person's name is Lü Leshun, the director of a newly established cooperative in Beiliang Village, Fourth District, Xingtai County. The title of his report was: "I thought about it for three years before I figured it out."

    "I am a liberated peasant, the Party and Chairman Mao gave me a good life, I have twenty or thirty mu of land, an ox, and I can sell some surplus grain every year." "During the land reform, I was an activist, and after the land reform, my work wasn't the most backward either. But I had one problem: I was unwilling to engage in agricultural production cooperatives. For three whole years, I kept away from cooperatives. The county party secretary once said to me: 'Let's start a cooperative!' I said, 'No, even families are splitting up, how can so many people be together?' To avoid starting a cooperative, I joined a mutual aid team every year, and I joined the most backward mutual aid team. I myself didn't work actively in the mutual aid team, afraid that if the mutual aid team did well, I would have to 'transfer to a cooperative'. This year, the socialist wave came, and the masses forced me to start a cooperative, everyone pushed me to do it; at first, I said, I don't object to joining the cooperative, but don't ask me to be the director, I can't read, I'm afraid of 'laboring my brains'. Everyone was enthusiastic, and a cooperative with sixty households was quickly established. I said to everyone, don't elect me as the director, but everyone still elected me. I was so worried that I couldn't sleep for several nights, how could I lead! You see, everyone is together, this one is talking, that one is asking, this one is crying, that one is laughing, what should I do? After Chairman Mao's instructions came down, I figured it out. I am a Communist Party member, I joined the Party in 1946, how can I be so selfish? I thought to myself: You are a Communist Party member, everyone trusts you, if you don't lead, are you going to let the landlords do it? No, as a party member, the idea of 'not being willing to pull the cart' (meaning serving the people) is wrong. Agricultural production cooperatives are a bridge to socialism and a happy life, we have to do it even if we turn twenty-four circles. I have since resolved to listen to the instructions from higher levels, learn from the old cooperatives, and definitely run the cooperative well."

    Wherever cooperation is reaching a high tide, people's new ideas are growing rapidly. The poor and lower-middle peasants who join the cooperative openly and firmly say: We are of one mind, we have no worries, we are heading straight for socialism; Chairman Mao relies on us, aren't we going to compete for a better life?

    Some individual households are calculating, and some have already calculated. In the past, some people regarded "starting a cooperative" as "staying up late" (meaning holding meetings) and "empty talk", "it won't succeed". Now their views have changed. I listened to a lot of people talk, and their opinions are: First, individual farming can't afford a double-wheeled double-furrow plow in a lifetime; the cooperative can buy a double-furrow plow together today, and it will definitely be able to use a tractor in the future; individual farming can't compete with a double-furrow plow, and it will be even less able to compete with a tractor in the future. Second, if farmers want to be prosperous, the land must have "fertility", individual farming can't accumulate a lot of manure; the cooperative makes manure and buys fertilizer, hauling it to the fields in large carts, there is enough fertilizer, and it is applied in a timely manner, how can individual farming compare? Third, individual farming can't buy one or two waterwheels in a lifetime, but the cooperative increases fifty a year (Wozhuang, Xingtai); repairing canals, repairing beaches, and digging rivers all require manpower, the cooperative not only has people, but also has organization, whatever you want to do, you can do it. Fourth, individual farming has to be subject to the land, the land tells you what to plant, and you have to plant it; the state's planting plan can't be completed, and crops with large profits can't be planted; the cooperative solves these problems.

    These opinions reflect the changes in the thinking of many individual farmers. They see and believe in the great power of organizing and taking the socialist road. The problem now is: "Joining the cooperative is a must, when is the best time to join?" The increasingly turbulent socialist revolution in the countryside and Chairman Mao's instructions are helping them to make up their minds. Some people's conclusion is: It is better to join now than to join in the future; the reason is that if you join now, you will become an old member in two years, and you will be politically honored. Of course, the main thing is to see that the economic strength of the cooperative is growing day by day, and it has fertilizer and new agricultural tools, large investment, and increased production; if you join in two years, your land fertility will not keep up, and you will have to pay money, which is not worthwhile.

    On this basis, we see an increasing number of farmers in the countryside demanding to join and start cooperatives. They actively connect with cooperative farmers, strive to accumulate fertilizer, exchange for large livestock, and make various preparations. They call this "presenting a gift for joining the cooperative," which is also a sign of sincerity. In many places, farmers are asking Communist Party members and cadres to come out to lead the establishment and expansion of cooperatives. This demand is increasing.

    How to solve this problem?

    Most areas are solving it well, such as Qianluzi Village in Xingtai County. Of the 99 households in the village, except for two landlord and rich peasant households, only two farmers have not yet joined the cooperative. The cooperative members said: These two households don't get along well with people, and they haven't figured it out yet. It won't be good if they come in all of a sudden. Let them stay outside for a period of time, let's try with them. This is in line with the actual situation.

    However, in individual places, the development of cooperatives is still lagging behind the demands of farmers (poor peasants and lower-middle peasants). This situation once occurred in Dawujiazhuang, Xingtai. This is a backward village. Of the 140 households in the village, a cooperative was established last year and collapsed. This year, poor and lower-middle peasants took the lead in establishing a cooperative with 40 households. The class situation in the village is: poor and lower-middle peasants account for 66.6% of the total number of farmers, upper-middle peasants account for 27%, and landlords and rich peasants account for 6.4%. The poor and lower-middle peasants who have joined the cooperative account for a very small part of the existing households. Is it true that all individual farmers are unwilling to join the cooperative? According to the director of the village people's committee, the masses are rushing to join the cooperative, and they go to the boundary every day to study the crops of cooperatives in the surrounding villages. The wheat in the Xiaowujiazhuang cooperative averaged 250 jin this year, but the wheat in Dawujiazhuang averaged only 190 jin because there was no cooperative organization. This specific number deeply impressed the superiority of the cooperative on the minds of the farmers and became the ideological basis for the farmers to demand to join and build cooperatives. Why not accept more volunteers into the cooperative? One member of this cooperative said: "Our cooperative cannot be a long stream, it is always open, you have to wait another year to join." Another member said: "We established a cooperative in the past, you didn't join, now you regret it, you are trying hard to get in, we have to wait and see, we have to investigate and see if you are genuine." Yes, before accepting each farmer, we must review them in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions and the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, proceed cautiously, and never violate the principle of voluntariness, so that farmers have ample room for consideration, and do not force them to pull them in. However, in areas where the conditions for the great development of cooperatives are already in place, neither should a closed-door attitude be adopted, nor should a wait-and-see approach be adopted across the board. This autumn and winter, cooperatives are conducting distribution work, which is a great review of the victorious achievements of the cooperatives. It will arouse the enthusiasm of more poor and lower-middle peasants to join the cooperative. For those farmers who truly voluntarily demand to join the cooperative, a welcome attitude should be adopted, which is beneficial to the entire agricultural socialist transformation cause.

    We must see the ideological changes of farmers, especially poor peasants and lower-middle peasants, in the high tide of agricultural cooperation, and we must rush to the front to meet and lead this change, instead of looking at the problem mechanically.

    As for those farmers who have no desire to join the cooperative? The Central Committee instructed us: "We should use the superiority of the cooperative to influence them, let them watch for a while longer, and absorb them into the cooperative after their level of consciousness has been raised." Rural party organizations and cooperatives in many areas have implemented this correct policy. Some wealthy middle peasants who once said "as long as you insist on voluntariness, I will always do as I please" have now also undergone ideological changes. According to their estimates, this time of "great development," it will always be their turn first, they waited and waited; however, no one came to "mobilize" them, these people were surprised. A wealthy middle peasant who withdrew from a cooperative in Zhangjiaying said: "When I was in the cooperative, I had to attend meetings, I didn't sleep a full night; after I withdrew from the cooperative, I haven't been able to sleep these days." It turned out that they were thinking about the cooperative's "framework" (meaning overall planning) day and night. The cooperative increased double-furrow plows, purchased fine fertilizer, added waterwheels... Every daily development stirred their hearts. They saw the great tide of cooperation, and therefore affirmed: "Society (meaning socialism) is the main road, everyone has to take it," "people let us be voluntary, we have to make up our minds." Now, many people hope that people in the cooperative will often go to "mobilize" them, tell them the policies, and help them open their minds. In individual places, there is a cold or even sarcastic phenomenon towards some wealthy middle peasants, such as calling them "old singles," which is inappropriate. We are not absorbing these people for the time being because they have not yet reached true voluntariness. We should educate them, use the superiority of the cooperative to influence them, and not isolate them.

    积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
    人的变化
    安岗
    农业合作化的高潮引起农村巨大的变化。“听毛主席的话，走社会主义的路”，这是普遍的呼声。在保定车站候车室外，我碰到一位农民，他是山西榆次县人，来保定卖梨。他兴高采烈地大声说：“下次不来了，回去就要入社。”“为了这点梨树，我整整琢磨了一年，入社好还是不入社好？榆次县出好果子，有了梨就有零花钱。可是，就是这点零花钱，害得我一年没有入社。”这位农民现在想通了，他看到入社以后，合作社能够给他更多的零花钱。因此，他说：“全村邻坊四邻都听毛主席的话，红火火地闹增产，咱孤零零地一个人在小山沟里干，太闷得慌。”
    思想变化最激烈的是一小部分没有站稳党的立场，因而对农业合作化事业抱有错误态度的共产党员。
    在河北省邢台县四个区农业生产合作社交流经验的大会上，人们用热烈的鼓掌来欢迎一位共产党员的自我批评。这个人名叫吕乐顺，是邢台县四区北良村一个新近成立的合作社的主任，他报告的题目是：“想了三年，思想才搞通了。”
    “我是一个翻身户，党和毛主席给了我好日子，有了二三十亩地，一头牛、每年都能卖出一些余粮”，“土地改革的时候，我是积极分子，土地改革以后，我的工作也不是顶落后的。可是，就有一个毛病：不愿意搞农业生产合作社。整整三个年头，我一直躲着合作社，县委书记有一次对我说：搞合作社吧！我说，不行，一家一户还闹分家呢？这么多人在一起咋办？我为了逃避办合作社，一年参加一个互助组，哪个互助组落后，我就参加哪一个。我自己在互助组也不积极干，怕把互助组搞好了又得‘转社’。今年，社会主义的浪头来了，群众逼着要办社，大家推着我干；起初，我还说，加入社我不反对，可是别教我当社长，我不识字，怕‘劳动脑筋’。大家劲头大，一下子就搞起了一个六十户的合作社。我向大家说，不要选我当社长，大家还是选了我。我愁的几夜睡不着觉，怎么领导啊！你看，大家弄到一起，这个说的，那个问的，这个哭的，那个笑的，让我咋办？毛主席指示下来后，我想通了。我是共产党员啊，从一九四六年就参加了党，怎么能这样自私自利？我心里想：你是共产党员，大家信任你，你不去领导，难道是要让地主干吗？不行，作为一个党员，‘不愿拉套’（即为人民服务的意思）的思想是不对的。农业生产合作社是走向社会主义，过幸福时光的桥梁，转二十四个圈也还得这样干。我从此立下决心，今后要听上级指示，向老社学习，一定要把社办好。”
    凡是合作化走向高潮的地方，人们的新思想都在急速地成长。入社的贫农和下中农公开而坚定地说：我们心齐，没有牵挂，一个劲儿奔社会主义；毛主席依靠咱们，咱不争馒头，还不争口气吗？
    一部分单干户正在打算盘，有的已经盘算好。过去，有人把“办社”看作是“熬眼”（即夜间开会）“耍嘴”，“成不了事”。现在改变了看法。我听了不少的人谈话，他们的意见是：一、单干一辈子也买不起、使不了双轮双铧犁；合作社今天能合伙买双铧犁，将来就一定能使上拖拉机；单干跟双铧犁赛不过，将来跟拖拉机更不能比。二、农民要富裕，就得地里有“肥劲”，单干不能攒很多粪；合作社又造粪，又买肥料，一大车一大车往地里运，肥料足，上得及时，单干怎能比的了？三、单干一辈子买不上一两辆水车，可是，合作社一年就增加五十辆（邢台窝庄）；修渠，修滩，挑河都得靠人干，合作社不但有人，还有组织，想干个啥就是个啥。四、单干得受土地的支配，地教你种啥，你就得种啥；国家种植计划完不成，得利大的作物种不成；合作社把这些问题都解决了。
    这些意见反映出不少单干农民思想的变化。他们看到而且信服了组织起来走社会主义道路的伟大力量。现在的问题是：“入社是一定得入，什么时候入好？”农村中日益汹涌澎湃的社会主义革命浪潮和毛主席的指示帮助他们下定决心。一部分人的结论是：现在入比将来入好；理由是，现在入，过两年成了老社员，政治上光荣。当然更主要的是看到社的经济力量一天比一天大，又有肥料，又有新式农具，投资大，增产多；过两年再入，自己的地力跟不上，就得贴钱，不合算。
    就在这个基础上，我们在农村看到日益众多的要求入社、办社的农户。他们积极串连入社农户，努力积肥，换大牲口，作各种准备工作。他们管这叫做“入社献礼”，这也是一种诚意的表示。很多地方，农民要求共产党员、干部出来领导办社、扩社。这种要求有增无已。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    多数地区解决的好，如邢台县前炉子村，全村九十九户，除两户地主富农外，只有两户农民还没入合作社。社员们说：这两户同人合不来，思想又还没有想开，他们进来一下子也搞不好，让他们在外边呆一个时期，咱们跟他们试试吧。这是合乎实际情况的。
    但是，个别地方，合作社的发展还落后于农民（贫农及新老中农的下中农）的要求。邢台大吴家庄就曾发生过这种情形。这是一个落后村。全村一百四十户，去年成立一个社，垮了，今年贫农和下中农带头成立了一个包括四十户的合作社。全村的阶级状况是：贫农和下中农占总农户的百分之六十六点六，上中农占百分之二十七，地主富农占百分之六点四。入社的贫农和下中农占现有户数很少的一部分。是不是单干农户全不愿入社呢？据村人民委员会主任谈，群众抢着要求入社，他们天天到地界去研究周围村庄合作社的庄稼。小吴家庄合作社的麦子今年平均收二百五十斤，可是大吴家庄由于没有组织合作社，麦子平均只收一百九十斤。这个具体数字把合作社的优越性深深印到农民心中，成为农民要求入社、建社的思想基础。为什么不多接受一些自愿的人入社呢？这个社的一位委员说：“我们的社不能长流水，天天开着门，要入社得再等一年。”另一位委员说：“我们过去成立社，你不加入，现在后悔了，硬往里钻，我们要等一等，得调查调查，看你是真是假。”是的，在接受每一个农户之前，都要按照毛主席指示和党的七届六中全会的决议精神来审查一下，慎重从事，一定不要违反自愿原则，要使农民有充分考虑的余地，不要勉强把他们拉进来。但是，在合作社大发展的条件已经具备的地区，既不应采取关门的态度，也不应一律采取等一等的办法。今年秋冬，合作社都在进行分配工作，这是合作社胜利成果的大检阅。它将会唤起更多贫农和下中农入社的热情，对于其中真正自愿要求入社的农户，应当采取欢迎的态度，这对于整个农业社会主义改造事业是有利的。
    我们要看到人们在农业合作化高潮中农民特别是贫农、下中农的思想变化，要赶到前面去迎接和领导这一变化，而不要机械地看问题。
    至于那些没有入社要求的农民呢？中央指示我们：“应该用合作社的优越性去影响他们，让他们多看一些时候，等到他们的觉悟程度提高了以后，再去吸收他们入社。”许多地区农村党组织和合作社执行了这一正确的方针，有一些曾经表示“只要你坚持自愿，我就永久自便”的富裕中农，现在也发生了思想变化。按照他们的估计，这回搞“大发展”，第一个总要轮到他们的头上，他们等了又等；可是，并没有一个人来“动员”他们，这些人奇怪起来。张家营一个退出合作社的富裕中农说：“在社时候，要开会，没睡过整觉；退社后，这些天简直睡不着觉。”原来他们日夜都在琢磨合作社的“社架”（即全面规划的意思）。合作社增加了双铧犁，购进了细肥，添了水车……每一个日常的发展都使他们的心为之一动。他们看到了合作化的大浪潮，因而肯定认为：“社会（即社会主义）是大路，人人得走”，“人家让咱自愿，咱到底得拿个主意”。现在，有不少人希望合作社里的人经常去“动员”他们，告诉他们政策，帮助他们开开脑筋。个别地方发生对某些富裕中农冷淡以至讽刺的现象，如把他们叫做“老单”，这是不妥当的。我们暂时不吸收这些人，是因为他们还没有达到真正的自愿，我们应当教育他们，用合作社的优越性去影响他们，而不要同他们隔绝起来。
