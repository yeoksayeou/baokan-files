Benxi, Local State-Owned Benxi Alloy Factory has successfully trial-produced seven types of copper alloys, including phosphor bronze and tin bronze, and nine types of master alloys, including phosphorus copper, nickel copper, and silicon copper, this year. These master alloys can be used to formulate hundreds of different specifications of alloys, which are indispensable materials for manufacturing parts for airplanes, ships, automobiles, tractors, and so on.

The first batch of phosphorus copper produced by the alloy factory has already been used in heavy industrial construction. Recently, the factory accepted a commission from the state to manufacture a batch of tin bronze for a certain factory in 1956. In order to ensure the glorious task of producing new products next year, the factory, in addition to further training workers to prepare for next year's production work, also plans to successfully trial-produce various aluminum alloys, fusible alloys, Babbitt alloys, and other alloys in the fourth quarter. These are non-ferrous metal materials urgently needed by the state's heavy and light industries.

　　本溪合金厂制成多种合金材料
    地方国营本溪合金厂今年共试制了磷青铜、锡青铜等七种铜合金和磷铜、镍铜、矽铜等九种母合金。利用这些母合金还能配制成几百种规格不同的合金，它们是制造飞机、船舶、汽车、拖拉机等的机件不可缺少的材料。
    合金厂生产的第一批磷铜已用到重工业建设上了。最近这个厂又接受了国家委托一九五六年给某厂制造一批锡青铜的订货任务。这个厂为了保证完成明年生产新产品的光荣任务，除进一步培养工人做好来年的生产准备工作外，在第四季度中还准备把各种铝合金、易熔合金、巴特合金等多种合金试制成功。这些都是国家重工业和轻工业迫切需要的有色金属材料。
