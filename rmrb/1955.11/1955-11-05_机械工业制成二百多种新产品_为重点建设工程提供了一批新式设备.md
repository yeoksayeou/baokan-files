    The state-owned mechanical industry has trial-produced many new types of products this year. According to incomplete statistics, state-owned mechanical factories across the country have successfully trial-produced and certified over 240 new products within ten months. Many other new products are currently undergoing testing and certification after being manufactured. The new products trial-produced this year are generally new equipment for key construction projects. Compared to similar products manufactured in the past, they require higher precision, or have larger capacity, necessitating further technological advancement and the overcoming of certain difficulties for their production. The successful trial production of these new products marks a further improvement in the technological level of China's mechanical industry.
    Many large-scale machines are among the new products successfully trial-produced this year. The 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine power generating equipment is quite large; the 40-ton boiler trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory alone has over 110,000 parts and stands six stories high when assembled. The 50-ton bridge crane successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant can lift 50 tons of workpieces with its main hook, moving at a speed of 105 meters per minute longitudinally and 43.3 meters per minute laterally on the steel beams of the metalworking workshop. Many of these new products are machines with very high precision. For example, the CK371 surface grinder successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai Machine Tool Plant is a first-class precision machine tool, with a tolerance of only half a silk (about one-fourteenth the thickness of a hair) within 500 centimeters of grinding workpiece.
    The production of these new products has strengthened the production capacity of various sectors of the national economy. The 1A62 lathe manufactured by the state-owned Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Plant is currently the most precise and efficient lathe in China. It enables machining operations such as turning planes, round surfaces, inclined surfaces, screws, inner diameters, and drilling to achieve high precision and smoothness. During the First Five-Year Plan period, this new type of lathe bears the heavy task of equipping various industrial sectors. The 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine manufactured by the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory and the 40-ton boiler manufactured by the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory, together with the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory last year and the power generation control equipment manufactured by the joint state-private Huatong Switch Factory, constitute China's first domestically made largest set of thermal power equipment, which has now begun to be installed in a power plant. The 600-ton molten iron furnace manufactured by the state-owned Dalian Engineering and Mining Vehicle Plant is an important piece of equipment for the metallurgical industry. It is used to store molten iron smelted by blast furnaces, adjust the composition of the molten iron, and maintain the high temperature of the molten iron with gas, which can shorten steelmaking time and improve steel quality. A new type of ventilator successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Shenyang Fan Factory has an air supply of 700,000 cubic meters per hour, which can ensure that large mines with 2,000 workers always have sufficient fresh air. The one-meter diameter centrifugal honey extractor successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory produces about 100 jin of white granulated sugar in just over ten minutes after the sugar paste is poured into the machine through a funnel.
    The broad masses of workers have fully demonstrated their enthusiasm and creativity in the process of trial-producing new products, and have greatly improved their technical level with the help of experts from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and other fraternal countries. For example, in the process of trial-producing the 6,000-kilowatt steam turbine at the state-owned Shanghai Turbine Factory, 73 advanced workers and outstanding workers emerged, and 174 workers were commended. During this period, the factory trained many young technical workers. Now, this factory, which was originally a repair shop, is able to produce new types of steam turbines with high technical requirements in batches. In 1950, the state-owned Guangzhou General Machinery Factory could only manufacture simple agricultural tools and other products, and encountered many technical problems in making even a animal-powered sugarcane press. In the process of trial-producing new products such as centrifugal honey separators, all the factory workers actively learned from the advanced experience of fraternal countries, overcame many difficulties, and finally mastered the technology for manufacturing relatively complex machines.

    机械工业制成二百多种新产品
    为重点建设工程提供了一批新式设备
    本报讯　国营机械工业今年试制了许多新种类产品。据不完全统计，全国国营机械工厂在十个月内试制成功并经鉴定合格的新产品，有二百四十多种。还有许多新产品制成以后正在试验和鉴定。今年试制的新产品，一般都是供应重点建设工程的新式设备。同过去制造的同类产品比较，它们都是精度要求高，或者容量比较大，需要进一步提高技术，克服一定困难才能制成的。这些新产品的试制成功，标志着我国机械工业技术水平的进一步提高。
    今年试制成功的新产品中有许多大型机械。六千瓩汽轮发电设备就很庞大，其中仅国营上海锅炉厂试制成功的四十吨锅炉，就有十一万多个零件，安装起来有六层楼高。国营太原重型机器厂试制成功的五十吨桥式起重机，它的主钩可以提起五十吨重的工作物，以每分钟纵行一百零五公尺、横行四十三点三公尺的速度在金工车间钢梁上走动。这些新产品中有许多是精密度很高的机器。如国营上海机床厂试制成功的CK371平面磨床就是一级精度机床，它磨制工作物的公差，五百公分以内只差半公丝（粗细相当于一根头发的十四分之一）。
    这些新产品的制成加强了国民经济各个部门的生产能力。国营沈阳第一机床厂制成的1A62车床是我国目前精密度和效能最高的一种车床。它可使机械加工中车削平面、圆面、斜面、螺丝、内径和钻孔等工作达到很高的精密度和光洁度。在第一个五年计划期间，这种新式车床负有装备各个工业部门的繁重任务。国营上海汽轮机厂制成的六千瓩汽轮机、国营上海锅炉厂制成的四十吨锅炉，已经同国营上海电机厂在去年试制成功的六千瓩汽轮发电机以及公私合营华通开关厂制造的发电控制设备一起，组成了我国自制的第一套最大的火力发电设备，现在已经开始在一个发电厂里安装。国营大连工矿车辆厂制成的六百吨混铁炉，是冶金工业的重要设备。用它容贮高炉化好的铁水，调和铁水的成分，并用瓦斯保持铁水的高温，可以缩短炼钢时间，提高钢的质量。国营沈阳扇风机厂试制成功的一种新型通风机，每小时的送风量达七十万立方公尺，可以使有二千名工人生产的大矿井经常得到充足的新鲜空气。国营广州通用机器厂试制成功的直径一公尺的离心分蜜机，在糖膏由漏斗注入机内以后，十多分钟就生产出约一百斤的白砂糖。
    广大职工在试制新产品的过程中充分发挥了积极性和创造性，并且在苏联以及捷克斯洛伐克等兄弟国家的专家的帮助下，大大地提高了技术水平。如国营上海汽轮机厂在试制六千瓩汽轮机的过程中，就出现了七十三个先进工作者和优胜工作者，有一百七十四个职工记了功。这个期间，全厂培养出了许多青年技术工人。现在，这个原来是修配厂的工厂，已能成批地生产新型的、技术要求很高的汽轮机。国营广州通用机器厂在一九五零年还只能制造简单的农具等产品，制一部畜力榨蔗机就在技术上发生许多问题。在试制离心分蜜机等新产品的过程中，全厂职工积极学习兄弟国家的先进经验，克服了许多困难，终于掌握了制造比较复杂的机器的技术。
