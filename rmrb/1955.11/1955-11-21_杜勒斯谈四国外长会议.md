　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, November 20th, TASS dispatch: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a broadcast address on the evening of the 18th. He said that the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Meeting did not reach an agreement, and therefore, "many questions remain unresolved."
    After pointing out the Soviet Union's peaceful initiative, Dulles said that the Four Powers Summit held in Geneva in July "showed that all parties hoped to end the resentment and enmity that could cause war. Everyone recognized that war would be a common disaster."
    Then, Dulles tried to prove that the Soviet Union seemed to have violated the instructions of the heads of government. He insisted that the Western countries' proposals on the first item on the agenda were "serious and far-reaching." He portrayed the Soviet Union as an opponent of German reunification, completely ignoring the Soviet Union's efforts at the meeting to enable the Germans themselves to participate in the discussion of the German issue.
    Dulles portrayed the United States as a country that has consistently advocated disarmament. He said that no agreement was reached on the second item on the agenda because the Soviet Union
   “did not attach as much importance to inspection and supervision as we did, and it continued to strive to conclude agreements, although there was no way to adequately check whether these agreements had been fulfilled.”
    Dulles also gave a one-sided explanation of the Soviet Union's position on the issue of East-West contact.
    Dulles did not dare to say that the Geneva spirit was dead, but he slandered the Soviet Union in every possible way, saying that it was "unwilling to create conditions for lasting peace" and "hindered the growth of trust."
    He said that he never believed that "the Geneva spirit is a panacea that can solve all the major problems in the world." He said: "President Eisenhower once said that he believes that the summit meeting has reduced the possibility of open war between our countries. Nothing has happened at the Foreign Ministers Meeting that requires changing this estimate of the situation. Therefore, this aspect of the Geneva spirit still exists."
    Dulles said that the term "Cold War" is "too ambiguous." He attempted to equate the "Cold War" with a "peaceful competition between countries" with different social systems and political systems. He said: "The Cold War in the sense of peaceful competition will inevitably continue." Dulles added: "The Geneva spirit could not and will not change this fact." He emphasized that the results of the Geneva conference "do not require" the United States to change its "defense" and "common security" plans.
    When talking about the prospects for future negotiations with the Soviet Union, Dulles said that the Foreign Ministers Meeting did not end future negotiations. Dulles said:
  “This is not necessarily the end of future negotiations. Neither the President nor I believe this will be the end of negotiations.”
    In the final part of his speech, Dulles said that President Eisenhower fully agreed with his assessment of the Geneva conference and the impact of this conference on American policy.
    Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 19th, TASS dispatch: After the conclusion of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Meeting, some Western political figures openly expressed satisfaction that the meeting was unable to make a decision to further ease international tensions on the basis of the instructions of the heads of government due to the attitude adopted by the Western delegations.
    A speech by Morton, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State in charge of congressional liaison, at a dinner at the American Club in Geneva, proves this point. According to United Press International, Morton said that "the Geneva conference dispelled false optimism" and would help the U.S. Congress pass the military appropriations bill. He believed this was a good result of the meeting.

### 杜勒斯谈四国外长会议

　　杜勒斯谈四国外长会议
    新华社二十日讯　塔斯社华盛顿二十日讯：美国国务卿杜勒斯十八日晚间发表广播演说。他说，四国外交部长日内瓦会议没有达成协议，因此，“许多问题悬而未决”。
    杜勒斯在指出苏联的和平主动精神以后说，七月间在日内瓦举行的四国政府首脑会议“表明各方都希望结束那种足以引起战争的结怨结仇情况。大家都认识到：战争将是一个共同的灾难。”
    接着，杜勒斯企图证明，似乎苏联违背了政府首脑的指示。他硬说，西方国家关于第一项议程的建议是“认真的和有深远意义的”。他把苏联说成是德国统一的反对者，而完全不谈苏联方面在会议上为使德国人自己参加对德国问题的讨论而作的努力。
    杜勒斯把美国说成是一贯主张裁军的国家。他说，在第二项议程上没有达成协议，是因为苏联
  “并不像我们那样重视视察和监督，它继续竭力要求订立协定，虽然没有办法充分地检查这些协定是否已经得到履行。”
    杜勒斯对苏联在东西方接触问题上的立场也作了片面的解释。
    杜勒斯不敢说日内瓦精神死了，但是他却百般地诬蔑苏联，说它“不愿意为持久和平创造条件”，并且“阻碍了信任的增长”。
    他说，他从来不认为“日内瓦精神是能够解决世界上一切重大问题的万灵药”。他说：“艾森豪威尔总统曾经说，他相信最高级会议已经使我们国家之间发生公开战争的可能性减少了。在外交部长会议上并没有发生任何事情而需要改变对情况的这种估计。因此，日内瓦精神的这个方面也仍然是存在的。”
    杜勒斯说，“冷战”一词是“过于暖昧的”。他企图在“冷战”同具有不同社会制度和政治制度的
  “国家的和平竞赛”之间划一个等号。他说：“和平竞赛意义上的冷战将会不可避免地继续下去。”杜勒斯又说：“日内瓦精神过去不能而且将来也不会改变这个事实。”他着重指出，日内瓦会议的结果“并不要求”美国改变它的“防务”和“共同安全”计划。
    杜勒斯谈到今后同苏联谈判的远景时说道，外交部长会议并没有结束将来的谈判。杜勒斯说道：
  “这不一定是将来谈判的结束。总统和我都不认为这会是谈判的结束。”
    杜勒斯在演说的最后部分说道，艾森豪威尔总统完全同意他对日内瓦会议和这次会议对美国政策的影响的估计。
    新华社十九日讯　塔斯社纽约十九日讯：在日内瓦四国外交部长会议结束以后，西方国家某些政界人士对由于西方国家代表团所采取的态度而使会议没有能够在政府首脑指示的基础上作出进一步缓和国际紧张局势的决定一事，公开表示满意。
    美国负责国会联系的助理国务卿摩顿在日内瓦的美国俱乐部的一次宴会上的演说，就可以证明这一点。据合众社报道，摩顿说，“日内瓦会议吹散了虚假的乐观主义”，并且会有助于美国国会通过军事拨款法案。他认为这是这次会议的一个良好结果。
