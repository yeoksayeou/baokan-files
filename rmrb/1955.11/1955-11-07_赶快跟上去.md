The Dadukou Branch of the Chongqing Post Office, from April to September this year, successively promoted "Volunteer Letter and Newspaper Stations" and "Cooperative Delivery Personnel" in Baqiao, Huayan, Jiansheng and other townships. Now, it is promoting this method in other townships, which has been supported by the masses. Zeng Pinfu, a cadre of the Jiansheng Township Agricultural Production Cooperative, said: "With the establishment of the volunteer letter and newspaper station, the newspapers are delivered to the cooperative every day, so that the members can see the newspapers in time and know the current events at home and abroad; unlike before, the newspapers were placed in the agency in the street, and it was only possible to pick them up during market days. Once we picked them up, there would be two or three sheets, and we couldn't finish reading them even if we piled them up. What we saw was also a thing of the past." With the great development of agricultural cooperativization, farmers are eager to learn policies, culture, and experience in running cooperatives and production through newspapers. In some areas of Northeast China and Shanxi, Hebei, Jiangsu and other provinces, farmers have also spontaneously established "Volunteer Township Post Offices."

Agricultural cooperativization has put forward many new requirements for all aspects of work, and the work of book and newspaper distribution should also hurry up and catch up!

    赶快跟上去
    重庆邮局大渡口支局，从今年四月至九月先后在八桥、华岩、建胜等乡推行了“义务信报站”和“合作社投递员”，现在又在其他几个乡推广这个办法，得到群众的拥护。建胜乡农业生产合作社的干部曾品富说：“建立了义务信报站，天天把报送到社里来，社员们能及时看到报纸，知道国内外时事；不像以前报纸放在街上代办所里，要逢场期才能去拿，一拿就有两三张，堆起看也看不赢，看到的东西也是过去的事。”在合作化大发展的情况下，农民迫切要求经过报纸学习政策、学习文化、学习办社和生产的经验，东北各地和山西、河北、江苏等省的有些地区，农民群众还自动建立“义务乡邮站”。
    农业合作化向各方面的工作都提出很多新要求，书报发行工作也应当赶快跟上去！
