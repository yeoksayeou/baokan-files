    Seize the Time to Complete Autumn and Winter Plowing

    The autumn harvest in most areas has concluded. One of the important tasks currently facing farmers is to seize the time and work hard to complete autumn and winter plowing, laying a good foundation for striving for an even greater harvest next year. Many regions have attached importance to autumn and winter plowing and have completed the plowing tasks in a timely manner. However, it is estimated that there are still around 800 million mu of land nationwide that should be plowed but have not yet been plowed, including 80 million mu of cotton fields, over 300 million mu of rice paddies and late autumn crop fields, and 400 million mu of miscellaneous grain crop fields. These should be plowed as quickly as possible.

    According to the state plan, the production of grain and cotton in 1956 must increase significantly compared to this year. Doing a good job in this year's autumn and winter plowing is a fundamental key to ensuring increased agricultural production next year. Autumn and winter plowing can not only preserve soil moisture and reduce the harm from diseases, insects, and weeds, but also improve soil structure and enhance soil fertility. The experience of farmers in many areas has proven that land that has undergone autumn and winter plowing generally sees an increase in production of about 10 percent.

    There are still quite a few people who do not understand the benefits of autumn and winter plowing; they tend to value spring plowing and neglect autumn and winter plowing. However, the effect of autumn and winter plowing is far greater than that of spring plowing. Especially in the northern regions, where droughts often occur in the spring, implementing autumn and winter plowing can better preserve soil moisture, prevent drought, facilitate timely sowing, and strive for a bumper harvest. According to a survey conducted by the Shandong Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences near Jinan, the soil moisture content of winter-plowed land was 11.6 percent, while the moisture content of spring-plowed land was only 9.04 percent; the grain yield of winter-plowed land was generally 3 to 5 percent higher than that of spring-plowed land. According to a survey conducted by the Shanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Work Team in Quwo County, cotton plants in fields that underwent autumn and winter plowing produced an average of more than one additional cotton boll per plant, and each mu of cotton field yielded an additional five to ten jin of ginned cotton. Generally, implementing autumn and winter plowing in rice paddies, gradually deepening the tilled layer, can improve soil structure, eliminate overwintering rice borers, and significantly increase rice yield. Whether in the South or the North, there are examples everywhere of increased production due to the implementation of autumn and winter plowing. These concrete examples should be used to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity and education to make farmers who do not value autumn and winter plowing recognize the benefits of autumn and winter plowing, so that their habit of not wanting to implement autumn and winter plowing will gradually change.

    This year's agricultural harvest is the best in the past three years. The cotton and rice harvests are especially bountiful. Some farmers have therefore developed a sense of complacency and relaxation; they want to "take a break" and have therefore relaxed their autumn and winter plowing work. If this lax attitude is allowed to develop, it will hinder the completion of next year's and even the entire Five-Year Plan's agricultural production increase tasks. Therefore, all localities must overcome this lax attitude and be sure to do a good job in autumn and winter plowing, create good conditions for next year's agricultural production increase, and strive for a better harvest in next year's agricultural production.

    Autumn and winter plowing require more labor and animal power, and some farmers have difficulties in this regard. Therefore, all localities must help farmers solve this difficult problem, so that the labor and animal power in rural areas can be rationally adjusted and the land can be plowed in a timely manner. In some areas, farmers often need to purchase some draft animals every autumn and winter for autumn and winter plowing. In these areas, in addition to strengthening the supply of draft animals, it is also necessary to strengthen the organization and allocation of animal power, so that the existing draft animals are fully utilized. Shuangcheng County in Heilongjiang Province has adopted two methods to solve this problem: one is to implement a method of joint use of draft animals by cooperatives and mutual aid teams in villages with less animal power, and to uniformly allocate animal power according to the needs of agricultural work. The other is to use the cooperative as a unit in villages with more animal power, and to rationally use draft animals according to the intensity of agricultural work. In this way, the problems of most villages have been solved.

    While carrying out autumn and winter plowing, technical guidance for farmers should be strengthened. Agricultural technology promotion stations should guide farmers to implement early plowing and deep plowing. Farmers in cotton-producing areas should handle cotton bolls and remove cotton stalks as early as possible in order to gain time for early plowing and deep plowing. Some farmers are afraid that early removal of cotton stalks will affect production, but this concern is unfounded. After severe frost, the vitality of cotton plants has ceased. As long as the cotton bolls are handled properly and not allowed to rot, even removing the cotton stalks will not affect production. In southern areas that grow late rice, the water in the fields should be gradually drained during the yellow ripening period of the rice to strive for early plowing. In arid areas in the North, the land should be plowed and harrowed immediately after the autumn crops are harvested in order to preserve soil moisture; in winter, fields with more rain and snow or low-lying fields can be left unharrowed after plowing to allow the soil to fully weather.

    The great development of the agricultural cooperation movement has provided the most favorable conditions for this year's autumn and winter plowing. Agricultural cooperatives have relatively sufficient manpower and animal power, and also occupy more cultivated land. We must actively lead agricultural cooperatives to do a good job in autumn and winter plowing, and influence and promote the vast number of farmers to complete this major task. Increasing crop yields is the main sign of running agricultural cooperatives well. Whether they are old or new cooperatives, they should demonstrate their superiority in the process of autumn and winter plowing. Rural workers who are leading the establishment of cooperatives should simultaneously organize farmers inside and outside the cooperatives to carry out autumn and winter plowing, and must not separate the establishment of cooperatives from production. Some farmers who are preparing to join cooperatives are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards autumn and winter plowing; they must be made to understand that if the opportunity to plow the land is lost, this will be very unfavorable for the cooperative and for themselves.

    This year, the promotion of double-wheel double-铧 plows and other new-style animal-powered farm implements has increased significantly compared to previous years. This is another favorable condition for carrying out autumn and winter plowing this year. The double-wheel double-铧 plows that have already been supplied to farmers should all be put into autumn and winter plowing, and the phenomenon of being left idle must be eliminated. New-style walking plows and original cultivated land farm implements should also be fully utilized. These farm implements account for a large proportion and cannot be ignored.

    This year, the equipment of agricultural machinery stations in various localities has increased, and this is also an important force for autumn and winter plowing, and their role should be better发挥发挥. In order to meet the farmers' requirements for expanding the area of autumn plowing, the Jilin Dehui County Agricultural Machinery Station has set this year's autumn plowing plan nine times larger than last year's. This is a very good approach, and all agricultural machinery stations should learn from this approach and set their work plans more aggressively.

### 抓紧时间完成秋耕冬耕

    抓紧时间完成秋耕冬耕
    大部地区的秋收工作已经结束，当前农民的重要任务之一，就是要抓紧时间，努力做好秋耕冬耕工作，为争取明年的更大丰收打好基础。不少地区对秋耕冬耕是重视的，已经及时地完成耕地任务。但是，估计全国应耕未耕的田地还有八亿亩左右，其中包括棉田八千万亩，稻田、晚秋作物田三亿多亩，杂粮作物田四亿亩，应该赶快把它们耕完。
    根据国家的计划，一九五六年粮食、棉花都要比今年增产很多。做好今年的秋耕冬耕工作，就是保证明年农业增产的一个根本关键。秋耕冬耕不仅可以保藏土壤水分，减少病、虫、杂草的为害，而且可以改良土壤结构，增进土壤肥力。许多地区农民的经验证明，经过秋耕冬耕的田地，一般约可增产百分之十。
    有不少的人还不懂得秋耕冬耕的好处，他们往往重视春耕、忽视秋耕冬耕。但是，秋耕冬耕的效果远远大于春耕。特别是在春季常常干旱的北方地区，实行秋耕冬耕，更可以保藏土壤水分，防止干旱，便于适时播种，争取农产丰收。根据山东省农业科学研究所在济南附近的调查，冬耕地的土壤含水量为百分之十一点六，而春耕地的含水量只有百分之九点零四；冬耕地的粮食产量一般比春耕地增加百分之三到百分之五。据山西省农业科学工作队在曲沃县调查，实行秋耕冬耕的地，每株棉花平均多结一个多棉桃，每亩棉田多收皮棉五斤到十斤。一般稻田实行秋耕冬耕，逐年加深耕层，可以改善土壤结构，消灭越冬螟虫，显著地提高水稻产量。无论南方或北方，到处都有由于实行秋耕冬耕而增产的事例。应该通过这些具体事例，广泛地深入地展开宣传教育，使不重视秋耕冬耕的农民认识秋耕冬耕的好处，这样，他们不愿实行秋耕冬耕的习惯就会逐渐改变过来。
    今年的农业收成是近三年来最好的一年。棉花和水稻更是大丰收。部分农民因此产生了自满松懈的情绪，他们想要“歇一歇”，因而放松了秋耕冬耕工作。这种松懈的情绪如果任凭它发展下去，就会妨碍明年的以至整个五年计划的农业增产任务的完成。所以各地都要克服这种松懈的情绪，一定要把秋耕冬耕工作做好，给明年农业增产创造良好条件，争取明年的农业生产有更好的收成。
    秋耕冬耕需要较多的劳力和畜力，而有一部分农民在这一方面有困难，因此，各地必须帮助农民解决这个困难问题，使农村中的劳力、畜力得到合理的调剂，及时把地耕好。有些地区的农民在每年秋冬两季，常常要购买部分耕畜，用于秋耕冬耕。在这些地区，除了要加强耕畜的供应工作以外，还必须加强对畜力的组织调配工作，把原有的耕畜都充分使用起来。黑龙江双城县采用两种方法解决这个问题：一是在畜力较少的村，实行合作社、互助组联合使用耕畜的办法，根据农活的需要，统一调剂畜力。一是在畜力较多的村，以合作社为单位，按照农活轻重，合理使用耕畜。这样，多数村庄的问题都解决了。
    在进行秋耕冬耕的时候，应该加强对农民的技术指导。农业技术推广站要指导农民实行早耕深耕。棉产区的农民要及早处理棉铃，拔除棉秸，这才能争取时间早耕深耕。有些农民害怕早拔棉秸影响产量，这种顾虑并无根据。棉株在严霜以后，生机已经停止，只要把棉桃处理得当，不要使它霉烂，即使拔除棉秸，也不影响产量。南方种植晚稻地区，要在水稻黄熟期逐渐放干田水，争取及早翻耕。北方干旱地区，要在大秋作物收获后，随耕随耙耱，以便保藏土壤水分；冬季雨雪较多或低洼的田地，耕后可以不耙，使土壤充分风化。
    农业合作化运动的大发展，给今年的秋耕冬耕提供了最有利的条件。农业合作社都有比较充足的人力畜力，占有的耕地也比较多。要积极领导农业合作社做好秋耕冬耕，去影响和推动广大农民完成这一重大任务。增加农作物的产量是办好农业合作社的主要标志，不论老社或新社，都应该在秋耕冬耕过程中把自己的优越性显示出来。领导建社的农村工作人员，应该同时组织合作社内外的农民群众进行秋耕冬耕，决不能把建社和生产分开。有些准备入社的农民，对秋耕冬耕抱观望态度；要使他们懂得，如果失掉耕地的时机，这对合作社，对他们自己，都非常不利。
    今年推广的双轮双铧犁和其他新式畜力农具比往年增加很多。这是今年进行秋耕冬耕的又一个有利条件。已经供应到农民手中的双轮双铧犁都应该投入秋耕冬耕，必须消除闲置不用的现象。新式步犁和原有耕地农具也应该充分加以利用，这些农具的比重很大，不容忽视。
    今年各地的农业机器站的设备都增加了，这也是秋耕冬耕的一支重要力量，应该更好地发挥它们的作用。吉林德惠县农业机器站为了满足农民的扩大秋翻地面积的要求，把今年秋翻地的计划，订的比去年大九倍。这样作很好，所有农业机器站都应该学习这种作法，把自己的工作计划订得更积极些。
