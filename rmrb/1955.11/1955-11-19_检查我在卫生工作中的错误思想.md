　　Examining My Erroneous Thoughts in Health Work
　　He Cheng
　　Editor's Note: During his tenure as Vice Minister of Health, Comrade He Cheng violated the directives of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong to unite Chinese and Western medicine, negated the practical role of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), despised the national cultural heritage, and insisted on the erroneous idea of restricting and excluding TCM. He held a despicable and malicious sectarian attitude towards TCM, causing no small losses to health work. What is particularly serious is that even after the Party Central Committee repeatedly pointed out this directional error, he still did not fundamentally change in his actual work. This is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology that is divorced from politics and the leadership of the Party. Comrade He Cheng's erroneous thinking is not only manifested in the issue of TCM but also in other aspects of health work. With the help of the Party and comrades, Comrade He Cheng has made a self-criticism of his erroneous thoughts. We are now publishing his self-criticism. Because Comrade He Cheng's erroneous thinking is harmful to the current socialist construction and also has a certain representativeness, we plan to continue publishing articles criticizing this aspect of erroneous thinking.
　　The criticism of Wang Bin's ideology that began in the Health News in early February of this year has been very educational for me. It inspired me to examine my erroneous thoughts in health work, allowing me to recognize the root of the errors and how to correct them.
　　In July, the People's Daily published speeches by Comrade Lin Feng, Director of the Second Office of the State Council, and Li Dequan, Minister of Health, at the National People's Congress, criticizing the Ministry of Health's errors in TCM work and other areas. I was the main person responsible for those errors. I would like to expose my erroneous thoughts as follows:
　　First, I want to address the issue of TCM. The issue of TCM is related to the health of the broad masses of the Chinese people, the inheritance and development of the precious medical heritage of the motherland, and the business of hundreds of thousands of TCM practitioners and over ten thousand households involved in the TCM industry. Whether the Ministry of Health grasps the policy on TCM correctly is of great importance to the successful completion of the task of people's health. However, I have made serious mistakes on the issue of TCM.
　　The Party's policy towards TCM is "to unite Chinese and Western medicine, correctly utilize the strength of TCM, and serve the people's health." However, in my work related to TCM over the past few years, I have, as the Party Central Committee pointed out, "adopted inappropriate policies of restriction and exclusion towards TCM in many respects." This is clearly contrary to the central policy.
　　How did this error form?
　　First, I looked at TCM techniques solely from a formal perspective, only seeing the backward and unscientific aspects of TCM, while ignoring the medical effectiveness of TCM and its enormous role in the people's health. Because of the underestimation of TCM techniques, the basis for uniting with TCM was lost. Although I generally followed the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions, mentioning the policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine and the importance of uniting with TCM in the summary reports of the First National Health Conference in 1950 and the Second National Health Conference in 1952, I did not truly and deeply appreciate the spirit of Chairman Mao's instructions. I merely felt that the number of Western-trained doctors was small and the people's health could not be ensured without the participation of TCM, rather than viewing the issue of TCM from a comprehensive and long-term policy perspective. Therefore, my unity with TCM stemmed from a temporary and expedient viewpoint, believing that Western medicine would ultimately replace TCM. So wherever there were Western-trained doctors, I didn't consider how to properly arrange for TCM. When TCM practices in cities became slow, I did not first examine the errors of the health administrative departments in restricting and excluding TCM; instead, I believed that this was a natural result of the improvement of the people's cultural living standards and the technical competition between Chinese and Western medicine. Therefore, I once called on urban TCM practitioners to go to the countryside to solve the problem of slow business. At the same time, I also believed that although TCM currently mainly serves farmers, TCM would inevitably be replaced by Western medicine in the future countryside. That is to say, I believed that the future of TCM would be: from city to countryside, from countryside to natural elimination. Furthermore, the adoption of inappropriate restrictive and exclusionary measures would accelerate the natural elimination process of TCM, ultimately leading to the extinction of TCM. Therefore, I would not actively utilize the strength of TCM and closely unite with TCM. Secondly, also because I looked down on TCM techniques, I was not confident in TCM's ability to take on the people's medical work. Therefore, I formulated a series of management, examination, and training methods. For example, in 1951, the "Regulations on Organizing TCM In-service Training Schools and Classes" were promulgated. Because the content of the training was mainly Western medical theory and preventive medicine, instead of adopting the approach of improving TCM techniques while concurrently studying Western medical theory and preventive medicine, many TCM practitioners who had undergone training had their faith in TCM shaken and did not master Western medicine well. In 1951, the "Provisional Regulations for TCM Physicians" were promulgated. In areas where TCM physicians were registered and reviewed according to the regulations, a large number of TCM physicians were unable to obtain legal practice status, resulting in so-called "underground doctors approved by the people despite government bans." This proves that this was a regulation that was divorced from reality and therefore divorced from the masses. The "Provisional Measures for the Examination of Physicians, TCM Physicians, Dentists, and Pharmacists" promulgated in 1952 were even more unreasonable. It was already inconsistent with the objective situation to hastily adopt examination methods to determine the quality and selection of TCM physicians. Adding Western medical content to the exam questions was extremely subjective and actually made things difficult for TCM. In Tianjin, the number of those admitted accounted for only about one-tenth of the applicants, which proves the inappropriateness of the examination method. These inappropriate regulations and measures formed many bad consequences in health departments across the country, ideologically influencing health administrative cadres nationwide to restrict and exclude TCM, resulting in a general deviation in TCM policy. No importance was attached to the rational arrangement and exertion of the strength of TCM and Chinese medicine. For example, TCM physicians could not legally enter hospitals, the production, supply, and sales of Chinese medicine were in a state of self-flow, the reimbursement of Chinese medicine expenses in public medical care was severely restricted, and TCM physicians were poorly paid for their work. For a long time, TCM business was not included in the national health plan. Also, because of the underestimation of TCM techniques, I neglected to organize the study and research of TCM techniques. Although the First National Health Conference called for mutual learning between Chinese and Western medicine, in actual work, only the study of Western medicine by TCM practitioners was emphasized. There was also no planned organization of academic exchanges between Chinese and Western medicine. Due to the lack of importance attached to TCM research institutions, research achievements were minimal, almost nonexistent. The publication of TCM books was not valued at all. China has always been known as a treasure house of crude drugs, with extremely rich experience in the cultivation, collection, identification, use, and preparation of crude drugs. However, few crude drugs were included in the newly published Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, and no serious collection and promotion of effective TCM treatment prescriptions was made.
    Since I had the idea of underestimating TCM techniques, I would naturally not seriously criticize the ideas of underestimating, discriminating against, excluding, and eliminating TCM. In fact, I defaulted to and supported this erroneous thinking. I naturally would not give any criticism to the arrogant calls to eliminate TCM made by Yu Yunxiu and others, nor even take a laissez-faire attitude toward the erroneous thinking toward TCM of Wang Bin, who once served as a senior health administrative cadre. For example, Wang Bin's remarks on TCM in his essay, "A Certain Medical and Health Organizational Form and Ideological Style Arise from a Certain Political and Economic Foundation," were extremely absurd, yet they spread without hindrance. Not only did some people in the Northeast write articles praising Wang Bin's essay as "having clear class nature and practicality," but also some people in Guannei regarded Wang Bin's essay as the supreme truth, and it was even used as study material for the ideological transformation of health personnel. Someone in the Ministry of Health also recommended Wang Bin's essay as material for foreign cultural exchange. This state of ideological confusion was not clarified for a long time, and it was impossible to fundamentally reverse TCM work in accordance with the Party's policy toward TCM.
    The above examples show that, in fact, I played a destructive role in the policy of uniting with TCM; I played a restrictive role in TCM business; and I showed an indifferent attitude toward the national medical heritage. These are the specific manifestations of the policy of restricting and excluding TCM. The harm of this erroneous policy is, as the Party Central Committee pointed out: "If it exists for a long time, not only will the people's health cause continue to suffer significant losses, but this part of our cultural heritage will be in danger of being lost." This is completely contrary to the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine and correctly utilizing the strength of TCM. The Party Central Committee pointed out: "They have adopted inappropriate policies of restriction and exclusion towards TCM in many respects, so that the situation of antagonism between Chinese and Western medicine and discrimination against TCM that has existed in society for a long time has not been changed. This is an extremely serious directional error in the work of the health department." This is a completely practical and completely correct criticism. I should be responsible for this error.
    The root cause of the above errors is my one-sidedness in ideological methods and my sectarian emotions towards TCM. I was blinded by this sectarian emotion and looked at the TCM issue incorrectly. I have not studied and researched TCM. I rely solely on subjective conjecture, echoing what others say, and erroneously believe that since TCM originated in ancient times (mainly the feudal era), its backwardness is inevitable. So I arbitrarily underestimated TCM techniques. My view of TCM techniques is also one-sided and formal, without focusing on the medical effectiveness of TCM, and without understanding the principle that practice is the standard of truth. For thousands of years, the Chinese people have relied on TCM to treat diseases, which is the greatest practice. Practice proves that since TCM can cure diseases, including diseases that Western medicine considers difficult to treat (such as the recent confirmation that TCM treatment of epidemic encephalitis B has amazing results. The facts convinced me). That is to say, many of TCM's diagnostic and treatment methods are reasonable; otherwise, diseases could not be cured. Not acknowledging the fact that TCM has medical effectiveness is an anti-scientific attitude. If the medical effectiveness of TCM has been confirmed, but is not promoted, then we are indifferent to the suffering of the people. Furthermore, since TCM has summarized long-term experience, it should also be recognized that it has a certain theory. Even if TCM's diagnostic and treatment techniques are not yet complete due to the lack of modern diagnostic and treatment facilities, and TCM's theory is not systematic and accurate enough due to the lack of a modern natural science foundation, it cannot be denied that it contains reasonable parts. From incompleteness to completeness, from unfamiliarity to familiarity, is precisely the inevitable process on the road of medical development. Therefore, taking a negative attitude towards TCM's techniques and theories is an extremely incorrect attitude. The correct attitude is to accept all of this heritage, and through careful study and research, remove the unreasonable parts, absorb all its reasonable parts, and continue to improve and enhance it to enrich modern medical science and serve the people's health. However, I did not have a correct understanding of the precious medical heritage of the motherland, and I took a one-sided view and an indifferent attitude. This is neither a honest scientific attitude, nor does it violate the Party's policy toward national cultural heritage. Secondly, because I did not adhere to the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine, but rather carried sectarian emotions in many aspects, I showed contempt for TCM, unwillingness to respect TCM, unwillingness to understand the strengths of TCM, and even exaggerated some weaknesses of TCM, obliterating everything. The management, examination and training methods promulgated by the Ministry of Health in the past, as well as other inappropriate measures, are specific manifestations of sectarianism, which played a role in undermining the policy of uniting with TCM, and continued to keep TCM in a position of being underestimated and excluded. This is very wrong. The correct attitude towards TCM is: it should be affirmed that uniting with TCM is a long-term policy, and uniting with TCM is not only because TCM has content sufficient to enrich world medicine, but also because they are a huge force in the people's health cause. Nearly half of the urban residents and almost all rural residents in the country now rely on hundreds of thousands of TCM physicians for treatment, which is a major political issue. Therefore, closely uniting with TCM and correctly utilizing the strength of TCM is a political task of the health department. According to the actual situation, in the unity between Chinese and Western medicine, Western medicine should bear more responsibility, and Western medicine personnel in leadership positions should more actively implement the Party's policy of uniting Chinese and Western medicine. In the past, I did not recognize such a political task and did not assume the responsibility I should have. In order to correctly implement the Party's TCM policy in the future, it is necessary to further criticize the erroneous thinking towards TCM, oppose the practice of attempting to obliterate TCM without investigation and research, vigorously publicize the Party's policy towards TCM, reverse the long-term situation of TCM being underestimated and excluded, and vigorously expand TCM business in urban and rural areas, so that everyone can use their talents and get what they deserve, and then improve and improve TCM on the basis of unity, so that TCM can play its due role in the people's health cause.
    Taking an indifferent attitude towards the medical heritage of the motherland, and adopting a policy of restricting and excluding the TCM forces that bear the health tasks of the broad masses of the people, is an extremely serious, rude, sectarian attitude, and an attitude of indifference to the health of the broad masses of the people. This is precisely a manifestation of extremely bad and despicable bourgeois psychology. This is the source of the erroneous thinking I have in TCM work.
    My erroneous thinking towards TCM did not fundamentally change for a long time, because I insisted on my erroneous views and did not quickly correct my errors in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and the criticisms from all sides. For example, the errors in the TCM issue before the end of 1952 were already relatively obvious, but at the Second National Health Administrative Conference, I believed that the basic issue of unity between Chinese and Western medicine had been largely resolved. By 1953, the regulations and measures for TCM promulgated by the Ministry of Health had already begun to be implemented one after another, and criticisms from various angles were reflected to the Ministry of Health. The correct attitude should have been to humbly consider the criticisms, admit errors, and carefully study ways to correct the errors. But at that time, I believed that the TCM issue was nothing great, and I rejected many correct criticisms. Even more serious was that after the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao pointed out in the winter of 1954 that TCM work had made directional errors, I erroneously believed that my views on the TCM issue were basically consistent with the central government. If there were errors, it would not be a directional error, but only deviations in execution, or the errors of subordinates. I even continued to look for evidence to insist on the erroneous views that TCM was backward and unscientific. Under this incorrect ideological situation, I would naturally not immediately and proactively conduct criticism of Wang Bin's erroneous thinking toward TCM, and I would not humbly examine my own ideological errors, and actual work would not have fundamental changes. The development of erroneous thinking to this point is because I had excessively emphasized the special technical nature of health work, neglecting the serious political nature of health work related to the birth, aging, illness and death of 600 million people, and treating the TCM issue only as a technical issue. I thought that I understood it, but the Party might not be clear about it. This created the ideological root of not relying on the Party in health work and neglecting the Party's collective leadership system, which led me to act hastily and arbitrarily on major TCM issues under the self-righteous mentality. I did not carefully study and understand the TCM policy that the Party had already clarified since the Anti-Japanese War, and many important regulations and measures were not reported to the Party Central Committee. After the Party Central Committee discovered and strictly pointed out that TCM work had directional errors, I did not take the instructions and criticisms of the Party Central Committee as a guide for examining my thoughts and correcting my errors, nor did I humbly accept the criticisms of the Party organization of the Ministry of Health. Instead, I regarded some slanderous remarks that underestimated and discriminated against TCM as my "theoretical" basis, so that for a considerable period of time, my views and practices on the TCM issue were inconsistent with the Party Central Committee. Therefore, it affected the normal development of TCM work and made myself an obstacle to the implementation of the Party's policy toward TCM in the health department. In fact, it was a rejection of the Party's leadership in health work and a self-governing state of the work department under my charge. This is a kind of reactionary bourgeois ideology, and it is precisely the crux of the matter that I could neither prevent errors nor easily correct them.
                ×　×　×
    My errors in ideology and in my relationship with the Party, in addition to being manifested in the TCM issue, have also been manifested in other issues:
    On the issue of higher medical education, I also had differences with the Party's education policy. Regardless of changes in conditions, I transferred the spirit of the medical education system during the war in the Northeast region, formulated a specialized key system and curriculum plan for higher medical education, and announced it for trial implementation in 1952. I had excessively emphasized the role of the specialized key system and short-term accelerated education, neglecting the adverse consequences it might produce. I only wanted to solve the current number of health cadres, neglecting that after the liberation of the country, we should focus on running regular education to cultivate high-quality construction talents for the country. This is a manifestation of the failure to combine current needs and long-term interests in the medical education issue. Because the subjects were too detailed, the specialization was too early, and the key points were too prominent, students could not obtain the comprehensive knowledge they should have, which limited the graduates' ability to continue to improve and develop on the basis of comprehensive knowledge. Moreover, because not only undergraduate courses adopted a specialized key system, but also specialized courses adopted a specialized key system, resulting in a wide variety of classes, different lengths of time, and different requirements, so several different lecture notes had to be compiled for one course, which put too much burden on the medical colleges that were reformed, making their work busy and chaotic, affecting the emotions of the teaching staff, and reducing the quality of teaching, so that many specialized graduates could not complete the tasks of specialized physicians. I also supported image teaching methods that violated the principles of Marxist education.
    During the economic recovery period, I did not pay attention to industrial hygiene. I pushed all industrial hygiene construction and even business guidance to the industrial departments to be responsible for themselves. As a result, industrial hygiene work at that time did not have a comprehensive work policy and appropriate business guidance, and the systems, steps, and methods of industrial hygiene were inconsistent. The number and quality of cadres were lacking, so that industrial hygiene work lagged behind the objective requirements of the economic recovery period, and it did not vigorously support the national industrialization from the health work aspect, which caused great losses to both economic recovery and economic construction. This is a manifestation of the fact that my arrangement of health work was not combined with the current political tasks stipulated by the Party. On the other hand, due to the errors in the TCM issue, the failure to enable TCM to exert its due strength also affected the normal development of rural medical and health work.
    During the Liberation War, I also erroneously believed that doctors who served the reactionary ruling class played the role of assistants to the reactionary ruling class. I did not regard them as medical science workers or mental laborers, but rather nitpicked on them.
    In the selection and use of cadres, I did not pay attention to political quality first. Wang Bin's problem is a prominent example. I did not recognize his extremely bad political quality, but trusted him, and with him brought many erroneous thoughts. I did not give serious criticism to the articles he published on TCM, Western medicine, and medical education, which was a default to and support for his erroneous thinking, which promoted the spread of his ideological toxins. Also, because a bad person like Wang Bin was trusted, good cadres were alienated.
              ×　×　×
    I am willing to publicly expose my erroneous thoughts and the bad consequences caused in health work here, taking it as a profound lesson. Secondly, it is also to alert health workers who share my erroneous thoughts. The reason why some of their erroneous thoughts have not been overcome is related to the errors in my leadership thinking. I am willing to accept criticism and accusations. From exposing and criticizing my erroneous thoughts, we can all be jointly alerted, eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, and open up a broader prospect for the people's health cause. From personal experience, I clearly realize that only under strong political leadership can we successfully eliminate bourgeois ideology, and only then will there be genuine and effective business and technical leadership, and only then can we develop and improve business and technical levels. Only under the strict leadership and supervision of the Party can we achieve strong political leadership; otherwise, it is all fantasy. In the past, our Party was able to lead the people and the army across the country to overthrow the rule of imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek and establish a people's democratic regime. After liberation, it was able to smoothly complete the various tasks of economic recovery in a short period of time, and it will also be able to lead the people across the country to smoothly complete the construction of economy, culture, education, and health in the era of socialist construction. The Party must lead everything. Practical experience has also proven that the Party can lead everything. Only by adhering to the Party's leadership in all work can the country's construction cause move forward with unified goals and steps. Maintaining the Party's unified leadership and obeying the Party's unified leadership are the keys to our winning the victory of socialist construction. Weakening or even breaking away from the Party's leadership will develop bourgeois ideology and cause serious errors. Unilaterally emphasizing that the health department is a special technical department and rejecting the Party's leadership is a reflection of bourgeois ideology and deserves my serious alert. I must also remember to humbly accept criticism and earnestly conduct self-criticism, so that I can clear the clouds for my bright future; a self-satisfied and self-righteous attitude is a poisonous flame that destroys oneself and endangers the revolutionary cause. In the future, I must strictly work under the leadership and supervision of the Party, with a honest scientific attitude and a diligent work style, and strive to avoid any exaggeration and pride, and do my part in the great cause of socialist construction.

　　检查我在卫生工作中的错误思想
　　贺诚
    编者按：贺诚同志在担任卫生部副部长工作期间，违背了党中央和毛泽东同志团结中西医的指示，否定中医的实际作用，鄙视祖国文化遗产，坚持限制和排斥中医的错误思想，对中医抱着卑鄙恶劣的宗派主义态度，使卫生工作遭受不小损失。尤其严重的是党中央一再指出这种方针性的错误以后，他在实际工作中仍然没有根本的改变。这是一种脱离政治、脱离党的领导的资产阶级思想的表现。贺诚同志的错误思想不仅表现在对待中医的问题上，同时也表现在卫生工作的其他方面。经过党和同志们对他的帮助，贺诚同志对于他的错误思想已经作了检讨。我们现在先发表他的检讨。由于贺诚同志的错误思想对于当前社会主义建设是有危害性的，同时也有着一定的代表性，我们准备继续发表有关批判这一方面错误思想的文章。
    本年二月初健康报开始进行的对王斌思想的批判，对我的教育意义很大。它启发了我检查自己在卫生工作中的错误思想。使我认识到错误的思想根源和纠正错误的办法。
    七月份人民日报登载了国务院第二办公室主任林枫同志及卫生部李德全部长在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言，批评了卫生部在中医工作方面以及其它方面的错误，我正是那种错误的主要负责者。我愿在这里揭露我的错误思想如下：
    首先我要提出的是中医问题。中医问题关系到我国广大人民的保健事业，关系到祖国宝贵医学遗产的继承和发扬，关系到几十万中医和十万户以上中药业的业务。卫生部掌握中医政策是否正确，对是否能顺利地完成人民保健事业的任务，关系极为重大。而我却在中医问题上犯了严重的错误。
    党对待中医的政策是“团结中西医，正确地发挥中医力量，为人民保健事业服务”。而我在几年来的中医工作中，则正如党中央所指出的那样：“在很多方面对中医采取了不适当的限制和排挤政策。”很明显这是同中央方针相违背的。
    这种错误是怎样形成的呢？
    首先我单从形式上去看中医技术，只看到中医的落后和不科学部分，忽视了中医的医疗效果和在人民保健事业中的巨大作用。由于对中医技术的轻视，就对团结中医失去了依据。虽然我曾一般地遵照毛主席指示的精神，在一九五○年的第一届和一九五二年的第二届全国卫生会议的总结报告上提到团结中西医的方针及团结中医的重要性，却并没有真正地深刻地体会到毛主席指示的精神。只是觉得当前西医数量很少，人民保健事业非有中医参加不行，而不是从全面的长远的对待中医的政策观点去看中医问题；因此我的团结中医是从临时应急观点出发，并且认为终必以西医代替中医。所以凡是有西医的地方，就不去设想如何妥善安排中医的问题。当城市中医业务清淡的时候，没有首先去检查卫生行政部门限制和排斥中医的错误，反而认为这是人民文化生活水平提高以及中西医的技术比赛的自然结果，因此曾号召城市中医下乡以解决业务清淡问题。同时又认为中医目前虽然主要为农民服务，但在将来的农村中，中医也必为西医所代替。这就是说，我认为中医的前途将是：由城到乡，由乡走向自然淘汰。更由于采取了不适当的限制和排挤措施，就会加速中医的自然淘汰过程，归根到底是使中医走向消灭，因此也就不会从积极方面去发挥中医力量，和紧密地团结中医了。其次也由于看不起中医技术，对中医担任人民医疗工作是不放心的。因此便制定了一系列的管理、考试和进修的办法。如一九五一年公布了“关于组织中医进修学校及进修班的规定”，由于进修内容主要为西医的理论和预防医学，不是采取在提高中医技术的基础上兼修西医理论及预防医学，致使不少进修过的中医既动摇了对中医学的信念，又未学好西医学。一九五一年公布了“中医师暂行条例”，凡根据条例举办过登记、审查中医的地区，就使大量中医不能得到合法执业的地位，便产生了所谓“政府取缔，人民批准”的“地下医生”。这就证明了这是一个脱离实际，因而也是脱离群众的条例。一九五二年公布的“医师、中医师、牙医师、药师考试暂行办法”更不合理。对中医急于采用考试办法定优劣，定取舍，已属不合客观情况，且在考题中加上西医内容，更是主观之极，实际上是与中医为难。天津考试结果，被录取者约只占投考人员的十分之一，这就证明考试办法的不当。这些不适当的规定、条例和办法在全国卫生部门中形成了不少恶果，从思想上就给全国卫生行政干部以限制和排斥中医的影响，致形成在中医政策上带普遍性的偏差，对中医中药的合理安排和力量发挥亦未加以重视，如中医不能合法地进入医院，中药的产供销处于自流状态，公费医疗中对中药费的报销限制甚严，对中医使用多报酬少，长期以来未将中医业务纳入国家卫生计划之中等。也由于对中医技术的轻视，就忽视了组织学习和研究中医技术。第一届全国卫生会议虽然号召了中西医互相学习，但在实际工作中则只着重要中医学习西医学。也不曾有计划地组织中西医间的学术交流。由于对中医药研究机构的不重视，致使研究成绩很小，几乎近于虚设。对中医书籍的出版，根本没有重视。中国一向被称为生药宝库，对生药的种植、采集、识别、使用、泡制等都有极为丰富的经验，但在新出版的中华人民共和国药典上收载的生药很少，对中医的有效治疗方剂，也未作认真的搜集和推广。
    由于我有轻视中医技术的思想，自然不会对轻视、歧视、排斥和消灭中医的思想进行严肃的批判。实际上我对这种错误思想是默认和支持的。对余云岫等的狂妄叫嚣消灭中医的言论和著述，自然就不会去给予任何批评，甚至对曾任高级卫生行政干部的王斌的对待中医的错误思想，也长期采取放任态度。如王斌的“在一定的政治经济基础上产生一定的医药卫生组织形式与思想作风”论文中对中医学的言论，荒诞已极，却毫无阻碍地传播开来，不只在东北有人著文称赞王斌的论文“有明确的阶级性和实践性”，即在关内也曾有人将王斌的论文奉为至理名言，并且还曾被作为卫生人员思想改造的学习材料，在卫生部也曾有人推荐王斌论文作为对外文化交流的材料。这种思想混乱的情况，长期未得澄清，也就不可能遵照党对待中医的政策根本扭转中医工作。
    从上述这些事例说明，实际上我对团结中医政策，起了破坏作用；对中医业务起了限制作用；对民族医学遗产，表现了漠视的态度。这些正是限制和排挤中医政策的具体表现，这个错误政策的危害，也正如党中央所指出的：“如果长期存在下去，不但将使我国人民保健事业继续受到重大损失，我国这部分文化遗产就有散失的危险。”这和党的团结中西医，正确地发挥中医力量的方针是背道而驰的。党中央指出：“他们在很多方面对中医采取了不适当的限制和排挤政策，以致长时期来在社会上存在的中西医对立和歧视中医的情况，没有得到改变，这是卫生部门工作中一项极为严重的方针性错误。”这是完全合乎实际，完全正确的批评。我应对这个错误负责。
    产生上列错误的根源，是由于自己的思想方法的片面性和对待中医的宗派主义情绪，我被这种宗派主义情绪蒙蔽了眼睛，把中医问题看错了。我对于中医学并没有进行过学习和研究，单凭主观臆测，人云亦云，错误地认为中医既然产生于古代（主要是封建时代），其落后是必然的，便武断地轻视了中医技术。我对中医技术的看法，也是片面的形式的，没有着重地从中医的医疗效果去看，没有体会实践是真理的标准的原则。几千年来，我国人民曾赖中医治病，就是最大的实践。从实践中证明中医既然能治好病，其中也包含西医认为难治之病（如近来证实中医治疗流行性乙型脑炎，有惊人的效果。事实使我折服了），就是说中医的许多诊疗办法是合理的，否则就治不好病。不承认中医的医疗效果这一事实，是反科学的态度。对证实了的中医医疗效果，若不推广使用，就是对人民的疾病痛苦漠不关心。更由于中医总结了长期的经验，也应当承认它有一定的理论。即使中医的诊疗技术由于缺乏现代诊疗设施，还不是较完备的，中医学的理论由于缺乏现代自然科学基础，还不够系统和准确，但是它包含有合理部分却是不能否认的。由不完备到完备，由不认识到认识，正是医学发展道路上必不可避免的过程。因此对中医的技术和理论采取否定态度，是极端不正确的态度。正确的态度是把这一份遗产全部接受下来，经过认真的学习和研究，去掉其中不合理部分，吸收它的一切合理部分，并加以继续改进和提高以充实现代医学科学，为人民保健事业服务。而我对祖国宝贵的医学遗产却无正确的认识，采取了片面的看法和漠视态度，这既不是老老实实的科学态度，也违背了党对待民族文化遗产的方针。其次由于没有坚持党的团结中西医的政策，而是在许多方面带有宗派主义的情绪，就表现出看不起中医，不愿尊重中医，不愿了解中医的长处，甚至夸大了中医某些弱点，抹煞一切。过去卫生部所公布的管理、考试和进修办法、以及其他不适当的措施，正是宗派主义态度的具体表现，起了破坏团结中医政策的作用，使中医继续处在被轻视和被排挤的地位，这是非常错误的。对待中医的正确态度是：应当肯定团结中医是长期的方针，团结中医不只由于中医学具有足以丰富世界医学的内容，而且由于他们是人民保健事业中一支巨大力量。全国近半数以上的城市居民和几乎全部乡村居民现在还依靠几十万中医治病，这就是一个重大的政治问题。所以紧密地团结中医，正确地发挥中医力量，是卫生部门的一项政治任务。根据实际情况，中西医间的团结，西医应负更多的责任，站在卫生领导岗位的西医更应积极贯彻执行党的团结中西医政策。我过去对这样一项政治任务，既然没有认识，也没有负起应有的责任。为了今后正确地贯彻执行党的中医政策，必须进一步批判对待中医的错误思想，反对不经调查研究便妄图抹煞中医的作风，大力宣传党对待中医政策，扭转中医长期被轻视、被排挤的局面，大力扩展城乡中的中医业务，使人尽其才、各得其所，然后在团结基础上改进和提高中医，使中医在人民保健事业中发挥应有的作用。
    对于祖国医学遗产采取了漠视态度，对担负着广大人民的保健任务的中医力量采取了限制和排挤的方针，这是极为严重的粗暴的宗派主义态度，是对广大人民健康漠不关心的态度。这正是极为恶劣的卑鄙的资产阶级心理的表现。这就是我在中医工作上产生错误的思想根源。
    我对待中医的错误思想，长时期内没有得到根本性的改变，其原因则在我坚持了自己的错误见解，未遵照党中央的指示和各方面的批评意见迅速地纠正错误。如一九五二年底前中医问题上的错误，已较为明显了，但我在第二届全国卫生行政会议上则认为中西医团结这一基本问题，已大体解决。到一九五三年，卫生部公布的对中医的条例、办法和规定，业已先后开始实施，就有从各个角度来的批评意见纷纷反映到卫生部。正当的态度应当是虚心地考虑批评意见，承认错误，仔细研究改正错误的办法。而我当时却认为：中医问题没有什么了不起，便把许多正确的批评意见顶回去了。更为严重的则是一九五四年冬党中央、毛主席指出中医工作犯有方针性错误的文字指示下达之后，我曾错误地认为自己在中医问题上的主张同中央基本一致，如果错了，不会是方针性的错误，也只是执行中的偏差，或下级的错误，甚至继续寻找根据，坚持中医的落后和不科学的错误见解。在这种不正确的思想情况下，自然就不会立即地主动地进行对王斌对待中医的错误思想的批判，更不会虚心地检查自己的思想错误，实际工作也就不会有根本性的改变。错误思想发展到这样地步，是由于我曾过分地强调了卫生工作的特殊技术性，忽视了卫生工作关系六亿人口的生老病死的严重政治性，更把中医问题只视为技术问题，自以为自己懂，党未必清楚，这就产生了卫生工作不依靠党，忽视党的集体领导制度的思想根源，促成自己在自以为是的心理下，对重大的中医问题，草率从事，妄作主张，既未仔细地研究和体会党自抗日战争时期就已明确了的中医政策，许多重要的条例、办法和规定的制定也未向党中央报告。当党中央发觉和严格地指出中医工作有方针性错误之后，也未把党中央的指示和批评作为检查思想和纠正错误的指针，也未虚心地接受卫生部党组织的批评意见，反而把某些轻视、歧视中医的谰言，视为自己的“理论”根据，以致在一个相当长的期间内在中医问题上同党中央的看法和作法不一致。因而影响了中医工作的正常开展，使自己成为在卫生部门中贯彻执行党对待中医的政策的阻碍，实际上就是拒绝党对卫生工作的领导，把自己所主持的工作部门作为自己的独立王国。这正是一种反动的资产阶级思想，也正是既不能防止错误，也难以纠正错误的症结所在。

    我在思想上以及对党的关系上的错误，除表现在中医问题上外，也曾表现在其它问题上：
    在高等医学教育问题上，也曾同党的教育方针有过分歧。我曾不顾条件的变化搬运了东北区战争时期的医学教育制度精神，拟订了高等医学教育专科重点制及课程计划，于一九五二年公布试行。我曾过分强调了专科重点制和短期速成教育的作用，忽视了它可能产生的不良后果。只想借此解决当前卫生干部数量问题，忽视了全国解放之后应当着重办正规教育，为国家培养质量较高的建设人材。这是在医学教育问题上当前需要和长远利益未能结合的表现。由于分科过细，专门化过早，重点过于突出，使学生不能获得应有的全面的知识，这就限制了毕业生在全面知识的基础上继续提高和发展。且由于不仅本科采用专科重点制，专修科亦采用专科重点制，以致班次种类繁多，时间长短不一，要求又各有不同，一门课程便要编好几种不同的讲义，使改制的几个医学院负担过重，工作忙乱，影响了教学人员的情绪，降低了教学质量，使许多专科毕业生完成不了专科医师的任务。我也曾支持过违反马克思主义教育原理的形象教学法。
    在经济恢复时期，对工业卫生没有重视，把全部工业卫生建设以至业务指导，都推给工业部门自行负责，以致当时工业卫生工作没有全面性的工作方针和适当的业务指导，工业卫生的制度、步调和方法都不一致，干部的数量和质量都缺，使工业卫生工作落后于经济恢复时期的客观要求，也就未从卫生工作方面来大力支援国家工业化，这对经济恢复和经济建设都造成很大损失。这就是我对卫生工作的安排没有结合党所规定的当前政治任务的表现。另一方面由于在中医问题上的错误，未能使中医发挥应有力量，也影响了农村医疗卫生工作的正常开展。
    在解放战争时期也曾错误地认为为反动统治阶级服务的医师，起了反动统治阶级的助手作用，没有把他们视为医学科学工作者、脑力劳动者，而是对他们吹毛求疵。
    在干部的选拔和使用上不是首先注意政治品质，王斌的问题正是一个突出的例子。我未认识出他极其恶劣的政治品质，竟信任了他，随着他便带来了不少的错误思想。他在中医、西医和医学教育等问题上所发表的文章，我没有及早给予严肃的批判，这就是对他的错误思想的默认和支持，助长了他的思想毒素的传布。也由于王斌这样的坏人被信任，使好的干部疏远了。

    我愿意在这里公开揭露自己的错误思想以及在卫生工作上所造成的恶果，引为深刻的教训。其次也借以警惕同我有共同错误思想的卫生工作人员，他们之中有些人的错误思想所以未能克服，是同我的领导思想的错误有关系的。我愿接受批评和指责，我从揭露和批判我的错误思想中，使我们都能共同地警觉起来，清除资产阶级思想的影响，给人民保健事业开辟更广阔的前途。我从切身的教训中清楚认识到，只有在坚强的政治领导下，才能胜利地清除资产阶级思想，也才会有真正的和有效的业务和技术领导，才能发展和提高业务和技术水平。也只有严格地在党的领导和监督之下，才能实现坚强的政治领导，否则都是幻想。我们党过去能够领导全国人民和军队，推翻帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石的统治，建立了人民民主政权。解放之后又能够在短短时期内顺利地完成了经济恢复的各项任务，也必然能够在进入社会主义建设时期，领导全国人民顺利完成经济、文化教育和卫生的建设。党必须领导一切，实际经验也证明党能够领导一切，只有坚持党对一切工作的领导，才能使国家的建设事业，以统一的目标和步骤迈步前进。维护党的统一领导，服从党的统一领导，是我们赢得社会主义建设胜利的关键。削弱以至脱离党的领导，就会发展资产阶级思想，造成严重错误。片面地强调卫生部门是特殊技术部门，拒绝党的领导，是资产阶级思想的反映，值得我严重警惕。我还必须记着虚心地接受批评，认真地进行自我检讨，这样才能为自己的光明远景拨开云雾；自负自满、自以为是的态度，则是一种毁灭自己，危害革命事业的毒焰。今后必须严格地在党的领导和监督下，以老老实实的科学态度，勤勤恳恳的工作作风，力戒任何虚夸和骄傲，在伟大的社会主义建设事业中尽自己一分责任。
