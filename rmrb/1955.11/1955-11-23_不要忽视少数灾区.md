　　Don't Neglect the Few Disaster Areas

　　This year, the country has had a bumper harvest of agricultural products, with significant increases in both grain and cotton production. At this time, we must not be complacent and forget the localized disasters suffered by a few areas. The People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has promptly seized upon this issue, issuing instructions on November 10th to the entire region regarding production and disaster relief. This instruction points out that the characteristic of the Inner Mongolia region this year is "interspersed abundance and scarcity," with areas of good harvest and areas of disaster. Even within areas of good harvest, there are villages suffering from partial disasters. Therefore, it is necessary to go deep into disaster-stricken areas and villages to understand and grasp the disaster situation. In conjunction with the "autumn grain requisition" and "three fixings" work, verify the disaster situation, ascertain the number of acres affected by the disaster in the affected areas, the degree of disaster and reduced yield, the amount of grain shortage, and the time of grain shortage, as well as the number of people in need of relief. Investigate and register outside disaster victims. When carrying out cooperative planning, attention should be paid to considering the participation of disaster victims in cooperatives and the issue of overcoming famine through production, so that production and disaster relief work are closely integrated with the cooperative movement.

　  不要忽视少数灾区
    今年，全国农产品大丰收，粮食和棉花，都大大增产。在这个时候，不要麻痹大意，忘掉了少数地区所遭到的局部性灾害。内蒙古自治区人民委员会就及时抓紧了这个问题，在十一月十日向全区发出关于生产救灾的指示。这个指示中指出今年内蒙古地区的特点是“丰歉插花”，有丰收区、有灾区，在丰收地区之间，又有遭受偏灾的村庄。因之，必须深入灾区灾村，了解和掌握灾情，结合
  “秋征”和“三定”工作，核实灾情，查清受灾地区成灾的亩数，灾歉程度，缺粮数量和缺粮时间以及需要救济的人数，调查和登记外来灾民。在进行合作化规划的时候，要注意考虑灾民参加合作社和生产渡荒的问题，使生产救灾工作和合作化运动紧密结合起来。
