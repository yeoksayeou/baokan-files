　　Transportation Conditions Improve in the Qaidam Basin
    To support the exploration and development work in the Qaidam Basin, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation has established road maintenance and repair organizations, as well as transportation hostels, along the basin's major transportation lines to facilitate transportation work. In March of this year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Transportation established a road maintenance section in Dulan to participate in the maintenance of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway. Automobile management organizations were established in Daotanghe and Dulan. In July, a civilian labor repair team was formed to carry out mobile maintenance work. In November, road maintenance sections were established in Nuomuhong and Mangai. This year, relevant departments have also established four transportation hostels along the transportation lines in the basin, with more than 140 newly built rooms.
