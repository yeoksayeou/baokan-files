　　Diverse Styles, Distinct Personalities
　　——After Viewing the “Finnish Print Art Exhibition”
　　Wang Chaowen
    The Finnish prints displayed in the waterside pavilion of Zhongshan Park in Beijing, with their keynote of love for life, beauty, and peace, are infecting Chinese audiences who also love life, beauty, and peace.
    These hundred-plus prints represent the labor of more than forty artists. The artists have utilized the unique effects of various printmaking techniques—woodcut, lithograph, and copperplate—to depict the lives and characters of the Finnish people, and the natural scenery of Finland. The themes are diverse, and the forms of expression are also diverse. The artists have chosen phenomena they deem worthy of evoking the audience's attention, sought unique forms of expression, and formed special styles. There is no echoing, no twin-like similarity among them; the personalities are very distinct.
    Many prints repeatedly depict ice and snow. Perhaps because Finland is a country located in Northern Europe, ice and snow are a common natural phenomenon, and the artists are concerned about this natural phenomenon. It is not only often the object of landscape paintings, not only often the environment of the figures in the paintings, but also sometimes the background of pictures featuring birds and animals. However, the ice and snow appearing in individual pictures are very varied, and never make people feel that they are monotonous or repetitive because of the artists' repeated depictions.
    Professor Aukusti Tuhka, who is visiting China this time and enthusiastically teaching printmaking techniques to Chinese artists, created the lithograph "Landscape of Lapland," which is as natural as an extemporaneous poem. The author wields bold strokes, using lush trees as a backdrop, and focuses on depicting snow-capped mountains illuminated by dazzling sunlight. It, like other works that also depict ice and snow, such as Vilho Askola's "By the Window" and Erkki Tanttu's "River," possesses the tranquil characteristics of Finnish landscape paintings. However, the main feature of "Landscape of Lapland" is its straightforwardness. "By the Window" depicts a village and alleys covered with unmelted snow from a bird's-eye view. The small houses in the distance have two glowing windows, revealing warmth in the cold and liveliness in the silent keynote. "River," in a conspicuous place, has a woman in thick clothes washing something by the water, emphasizing the ripples, which gradually spread out in circles, breaking the calm and giving the static landscape painting a dynamic mood. Here, ice and snow are a foil for the actions of the person washing clothes, which is conducive to expressing the resilient character of the people fighting against nature. The landscape paintings of these few artists, whose keynote is tranquility and whose style is simple and unadorned, like the works of other artists that cannot be mentioned here one by one, have one of their advantages, in our accustomed way of saying, which is "let a hundred flowers bloom."
    I do not attempt to introduce these many beautiful works one by one. To illustrate the variety of Finnish prints, it is necessary to compare Lennart Segerstråle's "Wild Ducks" and "Swans" with Erkki Karanka's "Rooster." "Wild Ducks," which are reminiscent of Chinese ink paintings of "Reeds and Geese," and "Swans," which are reminiscent of Chinese embroidery, depict the shapes, postures, and habits of ducks and geese in a leisurely and unhurried manner. The notable feature of these prints is their strong decorative interest, gentle changes in light and dark, and attention to balance and symmetry everywhere. "Rooster," on the other hand, has a completely different style. The artist used clear black and white tones, and rapid brushstrokes, to exaggerate the characteristics of the proud rooster. The spirit of this rooster, spreading its wings and tail, sticking out its chest, raising its head, and screeching with its throat tightened, appears particularly vivid due to the strong tones. These works, which have chosen different themes and used different methods to deal with the themes, boldly express the artists' own interests and preferences. And this interest and preference does not violate the characteristics of the object, but rather makes the vividness of the artist's emotions and the characteristics of the object able to be harmoniously expressed together.
    The prints with human life as their subject matter also have very distinct characteristics. Just looking at the titles of Henri Eriksson's five works, the audience will feel that it is very different from the works of other artists such as Aarne Aho. The former are "Patrol," "Spanish Parade," "Demonstration March," "Agitator," and "Prisoner Camp"; the latter are "Nude," "Weaver," "Grandma," and "Boy."
    I do not understand the specific basis of the themes chosen by Henri Eriksson's works, but I think that works like "Prisoner Camp" are good works that excel in the profound depiction of human psychology. On the hillside with barbed wire as a background, some tired men are sitting and lying down, bare-chested and barefoot. The young man who occupies a prominent position in the picture is sitting, his arms crossed over his knees, his lips pressed against the back of his hand, thinking about his own destiny. The non-verbal art of modeling does not and does not need to directly tell the audience what the characters are thinking about; however, the power of this image lies in its ability to clearly show the characters' psychological state in itself. As long as this troubled and uneasy image of this work is compared with works with similar content such as Rodin's "The Thinker," the unique achievements of this printmaker, who is good at expressing psychology, can be clearly seen. In addition, works such as Hugo Simberg's "Discordant Melody," "Death and the Farmer" and Tapio Tapiovaara's "Accident," "Guernica," are all attempts to profoundly express human emotions, or do not shy away from depicting the painful side of life.
    The works of Aarne Aho, which also focus on human life, such as "Weaver," show that the author chooses smaller phenomena in daily life and is concerned with quiet beauty. The form corresponding to this is gradually changing soft light and dark tones, rounded, stable, and even somewhat naive modeling. I don't want to compare the gains and losses of these works in content out of thin air, I just want to say again one of their achievements: distinct personality, cannot be replaced by each other, cannot be confused with each other.
    For the time being, I am still unable to deeply understand the realistic basis for the formation of the characteristics of Finnish prints, but I am certain that this art exhibition, for Chinese artists who are enriching and developing artistic taste and striving to form a diversity of forms, styles and genres, will be more than just further understanding the character of the Finnish people and the beauty of nature. Because, in addition to the above-mentioned works, other works, such as Inni Pärnänen-Grånfeldt's lively and fluent "Dance of Heaven and Earth," Henri Tikkanen's "Net Mender," which seems to try to avoid fire and is as simple and black and white as Chinese paper-cuts, Matti Visanti's illustration "Lamb," which is good at using needle carving to construct gray tones, Veikko Vionoja's "On the Way to the Factory," which intentionally does not emphasize the three-dimensionality of the shape and has rustic colors, and other prints on display, all possess distinct personality characteristics. These prints may have an impact on the art of New China, strengthening expressiveness and strengthening the personality of the works. (Attached pictures)

### 多样的风格，鲜明的个性——“芬兰版画艺术展览”观后

　　多样的风格，鲜明的个性
　　——“芬兰版画艺术展览”观后
　　王朝闻
    陈列在北京中山公园水榭的芬兰版画，以热爱生活、美与和平的基调，感染着热爱生活、美与和平的中国观众。
    这一百多幅版画，代表四十多个画家的劳动成果。画家们发挥了各种版画——木刻、石版、铜版的特殊效能，描写了芬兰人民的生活、性格和芬兰的自然景色。题材是多样的，表现形式也是多样的。画家们选择了他们认为值得唤起观众注意的现象，寻求独特的表现形式，形成了特殊的风格。它们之间没有随声附和，没有双生儿般的相似，个性很鲜明。
    许多版画都反复地描写了冰和雪。也许因为芬兰是位于北欧的国度，冰雪是一种常见的自然现象，画家们关心这种自然现象。它不只常常是风景画的对象，不只常常是画中人物的环境，而且有时是以鸟兽为主的画面的背景。可是，出现在各别画面上的冰雪，很有变化，绝不因为画家的反复描写而使人感到它单调、重复。
    这一次来中国访问、热情地把版画技术教给中国美术家的奥库斯蒂·杜赫格教授的石版画“拉比省的风景”，是一幅即兴诗一样自然的作品。作者挥动着粗豪的笔触，以葱郁的林木为映衬，着重描写了被耀眼的阳光照射着的雪山。它和同样是描写了冰雪的其他作品，例如维尔荷·阿斯高拉的“凭窗”、埃基·坦杜的“河”一样，都具有芬兰风景画的宁静的特色。可是“拉比省的风景”的主要特色在于爽朗。“凭窗”，是从俯视的角度，描写覆盖着尚未融化的雪的村庄和小巷。远处的小屋有两个发光的窗户，在寒冷中透露出温情，在沉寂的基调中透露着活泼。“河”，在触目的地方，有一个衣服很厚的妇人正在水边洗东西，着重描写了波纹，一圈圈地逐渐荡漾开来，冲破了平静，使静的风景画具有动的情调。冰雪在这儿是洗东西的人的行动的衬托，它是有利于表现坚韧地同自然斗争的人民性格。基调宁静，风格朴实无华的这几位画家的风景画，和其他在这儿不能一一提到的画家的作品一样，它们的好处之一，用我们习惯了的说法，就是“百花齐放”。
    我不企图一一介绍这许多美丽的作品。为了说明芬兰版画的多采，有必要比较一下伦纳尔特·塞格尔斯特列尔的“野鸭”、“天鹅”和尔斯科·卡拉卡的“公鸡”。使人联想到中国水墨画“芦雁”之类的“野鸭”，使人联想到中国刺绣的“天鹅”，作者描写了悠然自得、从容不迫的鸭和鹅的形状、姿态和习性。这几幅版画引人注意的特点，是装饰趣味浓厚，明暗变化很柔和，处处注意均衡和对称。而“公鸡”，格调完全两样。画家运用了黑白分明的色调，节奏急促的笔触，夸张地表现了得意的公鸡的特点。这个张着翅膀和尾巴、挺着胸、昂着头、逼尖了喉咙喔喔高叫的公鸡的神气，由于强烈的调子，显得分外鲜明。选择了不同题材和运用了不同方式来处理题材的这些作品，大胆地表现了画家自己的兴趣和偏爱。而这种兴趣和偏爱，并不违背对象的特征，却是使画家情感的鲜明性和对象的特征能够和谐地表现在一起。
    以人的生活为题材的版画，特点也很鲜明。单看亨利·埃里克逊的五幅作品的标题，观众就会感到它和其他画家如阿尔恩·阿荷的作品很不同。前者是“巡逻”、“西班牙的游行队伍”、“示威游行”、“鼓动者”、“俘虏营”；后者是“裸体”、
  “编织工”、“奶奶”、“男孩”。
    我不懂得亨利·埃里克逊的作品所选择的题材的具体根据，可是我以为“俘虏营”这样的作品，是以人物心理描写的深刻见长的好作品。用铁丝网作背景的坡地上，坐着和躺着一些疲乏的裸着上身和赤着脚的男人。占据画面的显著地位的那个青年，坐着，交叉的双臂拦在膝盖上，嘴唇贴在手背上，为自己的命运思索着。不会说话的造形艺术，没有也不必直接告诉观众说人物究竟正在思索什么；可是，这一形象的力量，在于它本身能够分明显示出人物的心理状态。只要把这一作品的那个烦恼、不安的形象和罗丹的“思想者”等等内容相接近的作品相比较，就可以明显地看出这个长于表现心理的版画家的独特的成就。此外，像雨果·辛伯的“不和谐的音调”、“死亡和农民”和塔皮奥·塔皮奥瓦拉的“事故”、“奎尼卡”那样，都是企图深刻表现人的情绪的，或者是不回避描写生活的痛苦的一面的。
    同样是以人的生活为对象的阿尔恩·阿荷的作品，例如“编织工”，看得出作者选择的是日常生活中较小的现象，关心的是安静的美。和这相适应的形式，是渐变的柔和的明暗调子，圆润的稳重的甚至可以说是有些稚拙味的造形。我不想凭空比较这些作品在内容上的得失，我只想再一次说到它们的成就之一：个性鲜明，不能互相替代，不能互相混淆。
    暂时我还不可能深入了解形成芬兰版画特色的现实根据，但我确信：这一画展，对于正在丰富和发展艺术趣味，正在争取形成形式、风格和体裁的多样化的中国艺术家，将不止于仅是进一步了解芬兰人民的性格和自然的美丽。因为，除了上述作品之外的其他作品，像印纳·白尔生—高里安得尔的刀法活泼、流畅的“天地舞”，亨利·提康宁的似乎极力避免火气、像中国剪纸那样简洁和黑白分明的“补网者”，马蒂·夫塞蒂的善于利用针刻、构成灰色调子的插图
  “羔羊”，伏依托·维凯宁的存心不强调造形的立体感而色彩古朴的“到工厂去的路上”，以及展出的其他版画，都具备着个性鲜明的特点。这些版画对于新中国艺术，可能产生加强表现力和加强作品的个性的影响。（附图片）
