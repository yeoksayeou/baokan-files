    The Kurle Oasis on the Frontier of the Motherland
    Wen Bin
    Crossing the Tiemen Pass, which is precipitous and beautiful, through the Tianshan Mountains, you will see an endless oasis, with the Peacock River flowing through it like a giant green belt. On both sides of the river, trees are dense, and canals are winding. This is the rich and beautiful Kurle Oasis in Xinjiang.
    On this flat, fertile and beautiful oasis, there are more than 160,000 mu of fertile cultivated land, and more than 100,000 mu of virgin land waiting to be reclaimed. More than 30,000 hardworking and brave Uyghur people live here. For hundreds of years, they have used their own hands to dig canals, draw water from the Peacock River, irrigate farmland, plant trees, and defend against the invasion of wind and sand, transforming this alkali滩 covered with weeds into an oasis.
    The Kurle Oasis has a mild climate, with an average annual temperature of about 12 degrees Celsius. The frost-free period is more than 170 days. Rainfall is extremely scarce here, but irrigation water is abundant, making it most suitable for cotton planting, and it is one of China's future high-quality cotton planting bases. Since liberation, thanks to the attention and help of the Party and the People's Government, the cotton planting industry has developed rapidly. In 1949, there were only more than 6,390 mu of cotton fields in Kurle County, with an average yield of only 20 jin of ginned cotton per mu; in 1954, the county's cotton fields had expanded to more than 17,500 mu, and the average yield of ginned cotton per mu had also increased to 56 jin. This year, the cotton planting area has expanded to more than 24,000 mu, with an average yield of about 70 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The cotton here is pure white in color and has fine and long fibers, making it the most popular raw material for fine yarn. The wasteland here is full of wild hemp. The fiber of this wild hemp is fine, long, and tough, making it an excellent textile raw material. Using the textile raw materials here, relatively high-grade textiles such as gabardine, women's melton, and valitin have now been woven. Sericulture also has great development prospects here. According to preliminary investigations, the existing mulberry trees in Kurle County can raise 1,300 boxes of silkworms. In 1956, the county plans to raise 500 boxes of silkworms, which can produce about 2,000 jin of cocoons. The Kurle Oasis also abounds in food crops such as wheat, corn, and rice, and oil crops such as safflower and rapeseed.
    The Kurle Oasis is also famous throughout Xinjiang for its abundant melons and fruits. The fragrant pears produced here are famous throughout the country for their strong fragrance, high water content, low residue, and storage resistance. In addition, fruits such as peaches, plums, apricots, walnuts, hawthorns, figs, grapes, pomegranates, oleaster, and red dates, as well as cantaloupe and watermelons, are everywhere. People can eat fresh melons and fruits here all year round.
    The natural scenery of the Kurle Oasis is also extremely beautiful. In early spring, the willows sprout catkins, and peach and apricot flowers bloom, with red and green reflecting each other, weaving into beautiful patterns. In midsummer in Kurle, lush trees are connected into one piece, like a curtain of green velvet. The Kurle wilderness in mid-autumn is a tapestry of gorgeous colors. Even when the earth is frozen and the wilderness is covered with snow, the scenery here is like "Jiangnan outside the Great Wall."

    祖国边疆的库尔勒绿洲
    文斌
    从险要峻峭、风景优美的铁门关穿越天山，便看到一片无垠的绿洲，孔雀河像一条绿色巨带，穿流而过。河两岸树木密密丛丛，渠水弯弯曲曲。这便是新疆富饶美丽的库尔勒绿洲。
    在这块地势平坦、富饶美丽的绿洲上，有十六万多亩肥沃的耕地，还有十多万亩处女地，等待开垦。这里居住着三万多勤劳勇敢的维吾尔族人民。几百年来，他们用自己的双手，开挖渠道，引出了孔雀河的水，灌溉农田，栽植树木，防御风沙的侵袭，把这片长满杂草的碱滩，改造成了绿洲。
    库尔勒绿洲气候温和，年平均温度在摄氏十二度左右。无霜期有一百七十多天。这里降雨量极少，灌溉水源却很充足，最适宜于植棉，是我国未来优良的植棉基地之一。解放以后，由于党和人民政府的重视和帮助，植棉事业已有了飞跃的发展。一九四九年时，库尔勒全县只有六千三百九十多亩棉田，每亩平均只产皮棉二十斤；一九五四年，全县棉田已扩大到一万七千五百多亩，每亩平均皮棉产量也提高到五十六斤了。今年棉田播种面积更扩大到二万四千亩，每亩平均产量约有皮棉七十斤左右。这里的棉花颜色洁白，纤维细长，是最受欢迎的细纱原料。这里荒地里满是野麻，这种野麻纤维细长、韧性大，是优良的纺织原料。用这里的纺织原料，现在已经织出华达呢、女色呢和凡立丁呢等较高级的纺织品。在这里，养蚕业也有很大的发展前途。据初步调查，库尔勒全县现有的桑树，可养蚕一千三百盒，一九五六年这个县计划养蚕五百盒，可产生茧二千斤左右。库尔勒绿洲还盛产小麦、玉米、水稻等粮食作物和红花、油菜等油料作物。
    库尔勒绿洲还以盛产瓜果闻名全疆。这里所产的香梨，以香味浓、水分多、渣汁少、耐贮藏等优点驰名全国。此外，桃、李、杏、胡桃、沙果、无花果、葡萄、石榴、沙枣、红枣等果类，和甜瓜、西瓜，遍地皆是。人们在这里一年四季都可以吃到新鲜的瓜果。
    库尔勒绿洲，自然风景也极其优美。初春，杨柳吐絮，桃杏花开，红绿相映，交织成美丽的图案。盛夏的库尔勒，茂盛的树木连成一片，像挂上了绿色天鹅绒的幕布。仲秋的库尔勒原野，是一幅颜色绮丽的地毡。就是当冰封大地、雪盖原野的时候，这里的风光也像是“塞外江南”。
