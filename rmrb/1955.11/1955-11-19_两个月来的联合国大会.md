The tenth session of the United Nations General Assembly has been underway in New York for nearly two months since its opening on September 20th. During this period, the General Assembly conducted general debates and reviewed the agenda, the various working committees of the General Assembly discussed the items on the agenda, and the General Assembly plenary session conducted elections for non-permanent members of the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and the Trusteeship Council.

This session of the General Assembly is being held under the favorable international situation following the four-power summit. Public opinion in all countries strongly demands the consolidation of the "Geneva spirit" and the development of peaceful cooperation among countries. This situation cannot but have an important impact on the work of this session of the United Nations General Assembly.

In the general debate of the General Assembly, the representatives of the vast majority of countries affirmed the achievements already made in maintaining peace and pointed out that further efforts must be made to resolve major international issues such as disarmament in order to consolidate peace. Many national representatives called on the United Nations to play its due role in promoting peaceful coexistence among nations. The Soviet delegation submitted to the General Assembly a proposal on "Measures for Further Easing International Tension and Developing International Cooperation," calling on the General Assembly to urge governments to continue their efforts to consolidate universal peace and security, so as to further improve international relations and strengthen trust among countries. This proposal has received widespread attention both inside and outside the United Nations.

The General Assembly's discussion on the peaceful use of atomic energy has achieved positive results in developing international cooperation in this area. The Political Committee of the General Assembly adopted a proposal without a single country voting against it, recommending that a second international conference on the peaceful uses of atomic energy be held within two or three years, stipulating that twelve countries, including the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, India, and Czechoslovakia, jointly draft the charter of an international agency for the peaceful use of atomic energy, and inviting all UN member states and member states of specialized agencies to participate in the conference to draft the final version of the charter.

The outcome of the discussion on this issue is a victory for the principle of international cooperation upheld by the majority of countries, and a failure for certain countries' attempts to monopolize this international agency as their tool. The representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries originally advocated that only eight Western countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, should draft the charter of the international agency, and that the agency should not be subordinate to the United Nations. However, this proposition met with widespread opposition. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries therefore had to revise their proposals repeatedly, adding invitations for the Soviet Union, India, Czechoslovakia, and other countries to participate in the charter drafting work, and only then was the proposal adopted. The adopted proposal does not explicitly mention issues such as the agency should be established within the framework of the United Nations, and that the agency should not exclude any country from participating. These issues need to be resolved through further consultations.

The Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries have raised the issue of stopping the testing of atomic weapons and banning atomic weapons during discussions on the peaceful use of atomic energy and the effects of atomic radiation. The United States has been evading discussion of this issue. However, this issue cannot be evaded, and the General Assembly's discussion on atomic energy issues further shows that the United Nations General Assembly should urgently undertake one of its main tasks—to promote the resolution of the disarmament and prohibition of atomic weapons issues.

A prominent feature of this session of the General Assembly is the upsurge of the anti-colonialist struggle. Issues related to colonialism account for nearly a quarter of the agenda of this session of the General Assembly. Despite the best efforts of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and other colonial countries to obstruct the inclusion of colonial issues on the agenda, some current urgent issues, such as the Algerian issue, the Moroccan issue, the Cyprus issue, and the West Irian issue, have been included on the agenda by a majority vote, with the exception of the Cyprus issue.

When the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee discussed the provision in the draft International Covenant on Human Rights recognizing the right to national self-determination, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries openly opposed the principle of national self-determination, demanding that the committee not discuss this provision, and were repeatedly met with shameful failures. The committee passed a motion by a vote of thirty-six to eighteen to discuss this provision first when discussing the draft of the Covenant on Human Rights, and then on November 7, it passed a motion by a vote of thirty-five to thirteen deciding that this session of the General Assembly should adopt the provision on the right to national self-determination.

It can be seen from this session of the General Assembly that the anti-colonialist front within the United Nations is strengthening and expanding. This front includes the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, Asian and African countries, and many Latin American countries have joined in. This situation reflects the vigorous development of the national liberation movement from Asia and Africa to Latin America, and reflects the expanding influence of the "Bandung Spirit." Many Asian and African countries and Latin American countries spoke in the general debate and in discussions on various issues, fiercely condemning the colonial countries for forming alliances to suppress the national liberation movement by force, condemning the colonial countries for hindering the economic development of backward countries, and demanding an end to colonialism in accordance with the resolutions of the Bandung Conference. The colonial countries were put on trial politically and morally. The United States has been standing with other colonial countries in this session of the General Assembly when discussing these issues, and the false mask of "anti-colonialism" that it put on itself has been torn to shreds.

An important phenomenon of this session of the General Assembly is that the United States' "voting machine" has largely failed. This is not only reflected in the voting on the above-mentioned colonial issues, but also in the election of non-permanent members of the Security Council. In the election of a non-permanent member of the Security Council to be held by an Eastern European country, the United States violated the provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Gentlemen's Agreement of London of the great powers, and insisted on nominating the Philippines to run for election. The Eastern European countries originally nominated Poland, but later changed to Yugoslavia in order to break the deadlock. However, the United States stubbornly insisted on electing the Philippines and exerted rude pressure on many countries. The General Assembly did not achieve a result after twenty-one ballots. The Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, the United Kingdom and most other countries of the Commonwealth, all European countries, and most Arab and Asian countries unanimously supported Yugoslavia and opposed the United States' attempt to undermine the agreed regional principle. This situation, even the American commentator Reston admitted that the United States in the United Nations "has suffered some failures that are too frightening to even talk about." Reston bleakly concluded: "The button-pushing majority in the United Nations has ended," and "American leadership" is "losing its effect."

Of course, in reviewing the work of the United Nations General Assembly over the past period, it can also be seen that although the international situation is tending to ease, and although the forces opposing peace and international cooperation have suffered continuous setbacks, these forces are still continuing to act and are still trying their best to obstruct the work of the United Nations General Assembly as an institution for international peaceful coexistence and cooperation. On the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Charter at the end of last month, the United States Representative to the United Nations, Lodge, delivered a speech, actually attempting to deny that the United Nations is an organization to promote peaceful coexistence among nations, and advocating that the United Nations be turned into an ideological group against the Soviet Union and communism. Lodge emphasized that the United States "frequently uses the United Nations platform" to conduct the Cold War. The United States is pursuing this course of action that Lodge spoke of in the United Nations General Assembly.

The United States and its followers once again obstructed the settlement of the issue of China's representation in the United Nations at the beginning of this session of the General Assembly. However, the great significance of resolving this issue cannot be diluted by any obstruction. In the general debate and the discussions of the committees of this session of the General Assembly, many countries spoke about the urgent need to restore the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. More and more people realize that the sooner this unreasonable situation is corrected, the more it will help to rebuild the prestige of the United Nations and restore the United Nations to a truly global organization capable of effectively discussing and resolving major international issues.

The "Cold War" forces are still obstructing this session of the General Assembly from discussing and resolving many major issues. This session of the General Assembly has been going on for nearly two months, but many major issues have not yet been discussed. The United States, fearing that its position in obstructing the resolution of the disarmament issue would be criticized, obstructed the UN Political Committee from discussing the disarmament issue before and during the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The United States also obstructed the Political Committee from quickly discussing the Soviet proposal on "Measures for Further Easing International Tension and Developing International Cooperation." Recently, the United States has also directed some South American countries to actively work to remove the Algerian issue from the agenda of the General Assembly.

The United States also unreasonably prevented the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the General Assembly's discussion on the Korean issue. Although fourteen countries in the United Nations advocated inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean issue, and ten other countries disagreed with the United States' practice of excluding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States still insisted on its unreasonable position, exerted pressure on other countries, and forced the General Assembly to pass a resolution excluding representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the discussion. Moreover, during the general debate on the Korean issue in the Political Committee of the General Assembly, the United States representative only slandered the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, without putting forward any constructive suggestions. All this shows that the United States is doing its utmost to prevent this session of the General Assembly from making its due contribution in promoting the settlement of the Korean issue and thus eliminating a factor of international tension.

It should be said that the current international situation has provided very favorable conditions for the United Nations to play its role and rebuild its prestige. However, due to the obstruction of the "Cold War" forces, the United Nations is still lagging considerably behind the development of the situation, and has not yet played its due role as an institution for international cooperation, which is not in line with the expectations of the people of all countries. There are still many major issues on the agenda of this session of the General Assembly—the disarmament issue, the Soviet proposal on further easing international tension and developing international cooperation, the issue of admitting new member states, the Korean issue, the Algerian issue, the West Irian issue, the issue of international economic cooperation, etc.—awaiting discussion, and the General Assembly should make positive contributions in promoting the resolution of these issues in the spirit of the United Nations Charter, and play its role in promoting the development of the situation towards peaceful coexistence among nations.

　　两个月来的联合国大会
　　万光
    联合国大会第十届会议自从九月二十日在纽约开幕以来，已经进行了将近两个月的工作。在这个期间，大会进行了一般性辩论和审查议程，大会各工作委员会讨论了议程上的各项问题，大会全体会议并进行安全理事会非常任理事国、经济及社会理事会和托管理事会理事国的选举。
    这届大会是在四国政府首脑会议以后有利的国际局势下举行的。各国公众强烈地要求巩固“日内瓦精神”和发展各国间的和平合作。这种情形对这届联合国大会的工作不能不发生重要的影响。
    在大会的一般性辩论中，绝大多数国家代表都肯定在维护和平方面已经取得的成果，并且指出必须进一步努力来解决裁军等重大国际问题，以巩固和平。许多国家代表要求联合国组织在促进各国和平共处上发挥它应起的作用。苏联代表团向大会提出了“关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”的提案，要求大会号召各国政府继续为巩固普遍和平和安全而努力，以便进一步改善国际关系和加强各国之间的信任。这个提案在联合国内外受到了普遍的重视。
    大会关于和平利用原子能问题的讨论，在发展这方面的国际合作上取得了积极的结果。大会政治委员会在没有国家投票反对的情况下通过了提案，建议在两年或三年之内举行第二次和平利用原子能国际会议，规定由苏、美、英、法、印度、捷克斯洛伐克等十二国共同来拟订和平利用原子能国际机构的章程，邀请全体联合国会员国和专门机构会员国参加拟订章程定本的会议。
    关于这个问题的讨论结果，是大多数国家维护国际合作原则的胜利，是某些国家企图垄断这个国际机构作为它们的工具的失败。美、英等国代表原来主张仅由美、英、法等八个西方国家来拟订国际机构的章程，主张这个机构不隶属联合国组织。但是，这种主张遭到了广泛的反对。美、英等国因此不得不把它们的提案一再作了修正，增加邀请苏联、印度、捷克斯洛伐克等四国参加章程拟订工作等，这样提案才获得通过。通过的提案还没有明确谈到这个机构应在联合国范围内成立、这个机构不排斥任何国家参加等问题，这些问题有待在进一步的协商中求得解决。
    苏联和其他爱好和平国家在讨论和平利用原子能和原子放射影响问题时，都提出停止试验原子武器和禁止原子武器的问题。美国一直在规避讨论这个问题。但是，这个问题是不容规避的，大会关于原子能问题的讨论更加显示出联合国大会迫切地应该承担起它的主要任务之一——促进解决裁军和禁止原子武器问题。
    这届大会的一个突出的特征是反殖民主义斗争的高涨。有关殖民主义的问题在这届大会的议程中占了将近四分之一。尽管美、英、法等殖民国家曾竭尽一切力量来阻挠把殖民地问题列入议程，但是除塞浦路斯问题外，一些当前的紧迫问题，如阿尔及利亚问题、摩洛哥问题、塞浦路斯问题、西伊里安问题等都以多数票通过列入议程。
    美、英等国在社会、人道及文化委员会讨论到国际人权公约草案中承认民族自决权的条款时，公然反对民族自决原则，要求委员会不讨论这项条款，也一再遭到可耻的失败。委员会以三十六票对十八票通过在讨论人权公约草案时首先讨论这项条款，接着在十一月七日又以三十五票对十三票通过决定规定本届大会要通过民族自决权条款。
    从这届大会上可以看到联合国内反殖民主义阵线的加强和扩大。在这个阵线里有苏联和东欧国家、亚非国家，并且有许多拉丁美洲国家参加进来。这种情况反映出从亚洲、非洲到拉丁美洲广大地区民族解放运动的蓬勃发展，反映出“万隆精神”的影响正在扩大。许多亚非国家和拉丁美洲国家在一般性辩论中、在讨论各项问题中发言猛烈谴责殖民国家结成联盟用武力镇压民族解放运动，谴责殖民国家阻挠落后国家的经济发展，要求根据万隆会议决议结束殖民主义。殖民国家在政治上和道义上受到了审判。美国在这届大会讨论到这方面的问题时都是同其他殖民国家站在一起，它给自己挂上的
  “反殖民主义”的假面具被撕得粉碎了。
    这届大会的一个重要现象是美国的“表决机器”大大地失灵了。这除了表现在上述殖民主义等问题的表决外，还表现在安全理事会非常任理事国的选举上。在选举安全理事会一个应由东欧国家担任的非常任理事国时，美国破坏联合国宪章的规定和大国伦敦君子协定，硬要提名菲律宾竞选。东欧国家原来提名波兰，后来为了打开僵局，改提南斯拉夫。但是美国一直顽固地坚持要选举菲律宾，并且对许多国家施加了粗暴的压力。大会经过二十一次投票仍未获结果。苏联和东欧国家、英国和英联邦大多数其他国家、所有欧洲国家以及大多数阿拉伯和亚洲国家都一致支持南斯拉夫，反对美国破坏协议了的地区原则的企图。这种情形，连美国评论员拉希也承认美国在联合国中“已经遭到了某些令人吓得连话都讲不出来的失败”。拉希凄凉地得出结论：“联合国中按电钮的多数已经结束了”，“美国的领导”在“失去作用”。
    当然，在回顾过去一段时期的联合国大会工作时还可以看到，尽管国际局势在趋向缓和，尽管反对和平和国际合作的势力在连续遭到挫折，但是这种势力还在继续活动着，还在竭力从各方面来阻挠联合国大会作为国际和平共处和合作的机构的工作。在上月下旬联合国宪章生效十周年纪念日时，美国驻联合国代表洛奇曾发表演说，实际上企图否认联合国是一个促进各国和平共处的组织，而鼓吹要把联合国变成反苏反共的思想集团。洛奇着重说，美国“经常利用联合国讲坛”进行冷战。美国在联合国大会中奉行的就是洛奇说的这一行动方针。
    美国及其追随者在这届大会一开始就又一次阻挠解决中国在联合国中的代表权问题。但是解决这个问题的重大意义不是任何阻挠可能冲淡的。在这届大会一般性辩论和各委员会的讨论中，都有不少国家在发言中谈到恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利的迫切必要性。越来越多的人们认识到，越快纠正这一不合理状况，就越有助于重建联合国的威信，使联合国恢复成为一个能够有效讨论和解决国际重大问题的真正世界性组织。
    “冷战”势力还在阻挠着这届大会讨论和解决许多重大问题。这届大会进行了将近两个月，但是许多重大问题还没有讨论。美国由于害怕它在阻挠解决裁军问题上的立场受到指责，阻挠联大政委会在四外长会议举行以前及期间讨论裁军问题。美国也阻挠政治委员会迅速讨论苏联提出的“进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的措施”的提案。最近美国并且指使一些南美国家积极活动，企图从联大的议程上删去阿尔及利亚问题。
    美国还无理地阻止朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论。尽管联合国中的十四个国家都主张邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论朝鲜问题，另外十个国家不同意美国排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的做法，但是美国仍然坚持它的无理立场，对其他国家施行压力，强使大会通过了排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加讨论的决议。而且在联大政委会就朝鲜问题进行一般辩论当中，美国代表只是大肆诽谤朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国，而没有提出任何建设性的建议。这都表明美国竭力阻挠本届联大在促成解决朝鲜问题从而消除国际紧张局势的一个因素方面作出应有的贡献。
    应该说，目前国际局势已经为联合国发挥其作用和重建其威信提供了十分有利的条件。但是，由于“冷战”势力的阻挠，联合国还相当落后于局势的发展，还远没有发挥其作为国际合作机构的应有的作用，这是不符合各国人民的期待的。在这届大会议程上还有着许多重大问题——裁军问题、苏联关于进一步缓和国际紧张局势和发展国际合作的提案、接纳新会员国问题、朝鲜问题、阿尔及利亚问题、西伊里安问题、国际经济合作问题等有待讨论，大会应该本着联合国宪章的精神在促进解决这些问题上作出积极的贡献，在推动局势向着各国和平共处发展上起到它的作用。
