　　"No Raw Materials Received" Workday at Shenyang Transformer Factory
　　Wen Tianshen
　　After receiving the material head from Huang Jinshan, the duty section chief, the turners immediately inserted red flags reading "No Raw Materials Received Workday" on their beloved lathes.
　　Since the first shift of the metalworking workshop began learning from the "No Raw Materials Received Workday" experience of the Moscow "Paris Commune" shoe factory in the Soviet Union on July 13th this year, eight workshops and thirty production teams throughout the factory have been carrying out "No Raw Materials Received Workday" production. As of October 20th, the workers in the metalworking workshop had completed 256 "No Raw Materials Received Workdays". In the last ten days of October, they will strive to complete eleven more "No Raw Materials Received Workdays." In this way, the entire workshop can strive to save 3,800 yuan in material costs in October.
　　On October 21st, eleven lathes in the metalworking workshop were engaged in "No Raw Materials Received Workday" production. Next to a muffle furnace lathe, I met turner Yan Fuyu, a young worker who was among the first to trial the "No Raw Materials Received Workday" in the metalworking workshop. That day, he happened to be carrying out his eighth "No Raw Materials Received Workday" production. He was concentrating on holding the tool handle, processing a shaft sleeve retaining ring for a transformer. Iron filings fell from the workpiece onto the bed in thin strands. To make the workpiece smoother, he frequently and carefully brushed some emulsified oil onto the processed part.
　　In order to save material heads, Yan Fuyu and turner Liu Tingju recently jointly improved several tools and operating methods. For example, after changing the previously thick back-cutting tool to a thin straight-rod tool, the material that could only produce five parts before could now produce two more parts. After they changed the six-millimeter-thick cutting blade to a three-millimeter-thick one, because the cutting surface was smaller, they could save three millimeters of material head for each part cut off. In the past, processing the "rotating shaft" on a transformer required two processes of cutting and punching. The 170-millimeter round iron could only make a 143-millimeter-long part. Now, using the live center method, a finished product can be produced in one operation, and 27 millimeters of material head that can be used as chuck material can be saved. These methods of saving raw materials have been widely used by workers on other lathes.
　　Zhang Qinggui, who works on a lathe with Yan Fuyu, suddenly thought of the copper rod required for producing two "top contact posts" (the parts he makes) during the "No Raw Materials Received Workday." If the rod material is twice as long, the material head remaining after cutting off two parts will also be longer, and it can be used more effectively. He once used such material heads to produce twenty-six "terminal" components.
　　To the right of Yan Fuyu's lathe, turner Li Chunmian had already made fifty-seven "long shafts" from fifty-seven material heads saved during the production process in the six hours since he started work at five o'clock in the morning. Comrades in the workshop told me that four years ago, he was still a young man from the countryside, and he only graduated from a technical school in 1952. Previously, it took him twelve minutes to make a "long shaft," but now he can make one in six or seven minutes.
　　In the workshop office, I saw a statistical table - with figures showing that in June, before the workshop launched the "No Raw Materials Received Workday," the scrap rate was 0.53 percent; since the "No Raw Materials Received Workday" was launched in July, the scrap rate has dropped to 0.31 percent by September. The reason is that the workers have improved their skills in order to save every little bit, and at the same time, the workers feel that everyone is striving to make more use of material heads, and it would be too outrageous to produce scrap again, so they are particularly careful when working. All these changes are reflected in the workshop costs, that is, the actual cost of the workshop in September was 8 percent lower than the planned cost.
　　On October 21st, the materials saved by the entire transformer factory supplied the activities of twenty-six "No Raw Materials Received Workdays," saving the country 1,081.80 yuan in material costs. If such "No Raw Materials Received Workdays" are carried out in Shenyang and even across the country, it will be able to accumulate more and more wealth for our motherland.

### “不领原材料工作日”在沈阳变压器厂

　　“不领原材料工作日”在沈阳变压器厂
　　文天申
    车工们从值班工段长黄金山手里接到料头以后，立刻在自己心爱的车床上插上了红色的“不领原材料工作日”的旗子。
    自从今年七月十三日金工车间第一工段首先学习苏联莫斯科“巴黎公社”制鞋厂“不领原材料工作日”经验以来，全厂已有八个车间、三十个生产小组进行“不领原材料工作日”的生产。金工车间的工人们到十月二十日止，已做了二百五十六个“不领原材料工作日”。在十月的最后十天中，他们还要争取完成十一个“不领原材料工作日”。这样，全车间就可以在十月份争取节约材料费三千八百元。
    十月二十一日，金工车间有十一台车床进行“不领原材料工作日”的生产。在一台焖罐车床旁边，我见到车工阎富余，一位最先在金工车间试行“不领原材料工作日”的青年工人。这一天，正巧是他实行第八个“不领原材料工作日”的生产。他正在精神贯注地扶着车刀手把，加工变压器上的一种轴套固定圈。铁屑一丝丝地从工作物上落在床前。为了使工作物更加光滑些，他经常细心地用刷子在加工部件上浇上一些乳化油。
    为了节约料头，阎富余最近和车工刘廷举共同改进了好几种刀具和操作方法。例如把过去厚的反切刀改为薄的直杆刀后，可以使原先只能出五个活的料多出两个活；他们把六公厘厚的切刀板改成三公厘厚的以后，由于吃刀面小，每截一个活，就可省出三公厘的料头来。过去加工变压器上的“转轴” 必须经过切料、打眼二道工序，一百七十公厘的元铁只能做一百四十三公厘长的活，现在改用顶尖顶的操作法，一次就能出成品，并能节省二十七公厘长的可作卡料用的料头。这些节约原材料的办法，已经被其他车床的工人广泛地运用了。
    跟阎富余在一台车床上工作的张庆贵，在“不领原材料工作日”里，忽然想到一次领两个“顶触柱”（他所做的活）所需的铜棒。棒料长了一倍，截下两个活后剩下的料头也长些，可以更有效地利用。他曾经利用这样的料头生产了二十六个“接线头”部件。
    在阎富余车床的右侧，车工李春绵从上午五点钟上班以来，在六小时的时间里，已经把五十七个在生产过程中节约下来的料头制成了五十七根“长轴”。车间的同志告诉我，四年前，他还是一个农村的小伙子，一九五二年才从技工学校毕业。以前，他加工“长轴”，要十二分钟才能做一个，现在六、七分钟就能做一个了。
    在车间的办公室里，我看到一张统计表——上面用数字说明：六月份，车间在开展“不领原材料工作日”前，废品率是百分之零点五三；自从七月份开展了“不领原材料工作日”以来，到九月份为止，废品率已经降低到百分之零点三一。原因是工人们为了一点一滴地节约，提高了技术，同时工人们觉得大家都在争取多利用料头，如果再出废品，就太不像话了，所以干活时特别细心。这一切变化反映在车间成本上，就是九月份车间实际成本比计划成本降低了百分之八。
    十月二十一日这一天，整个变压器厂节约的材料供给了二十六个“不领原材料工作日”的活动，为国家节约了材料费一千零八十一元八角。像这样的“不领原材料工作日”如果在沈阳以至全国都开展起来，它就能够为我们的祖国积累更多更多的财富。
