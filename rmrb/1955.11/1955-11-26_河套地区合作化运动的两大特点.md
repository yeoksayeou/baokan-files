　　Actively and Plannedly Carry Out the Agricultural Cooperative Movement
　　Two Major Characteristics of the Cooperative Movement in the Hetao Area
　　Hao Pingnan, Secretary of the Hetao District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region

    In 1953, the Hetao District of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region experimentally established eight agricultural production cooperatives; in 1954, another forty-eight cooperatives were established, achieving the goal of having cooperatives in every district; in 1955, four hundred and fifty-seven cooperatives were established, with peasant households joining the cooperatives reaching 18.75 percent of the total peasant households, basically achieving the goal of having cooperatives in every township. Over 95 percent of the cooperatives in the region have increased production.

    This year, the Party committees at all levels in the Hetao area, based on the principle of comprehensive planning and strengthened leadership, have re-formulated plans for the development of cooperatives. According to the plans of various counties and banners, in the winter of 1955, the proportion of households joining cooperatives in the total number of peasant households in the region will reach 35 percent, in the winter of 1956 it will reach 70 percent, and in the winter of 1957 it will reach 75 percent. Furthermore, in 1956 and 1957, the region will also experimentally establish ten to twenty advanced forms of agricultural production cooperatives. We believe that this task can be successfully completed.

    At present, the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants is unprecedentedly high. Before the autumn harvest, many mutual aid teams had already submitted requests to the township branches for the establishment of cooperatives. The Linhe County Party Committee once received more than forty applications from peasants requesting the establishment of cooperatives. When the Deputy Secretary of the District Committee of the First District of Hanggin Rear Banner went to Shagou Township, the masses surrounded him and refused to let him leave, questioning him: "Last year it was postponed to this year, this year it is postponed to next year, when will the cooperatives be established?" When the members of a mutual aid team in Haizi Yan Township, Dalat Rear Banner, heard that the district committee's plan for establishing cooperatives this year did not include them, they immediately asked the mutual aid team leader to ride a horse to the district committee to apply again. Finally, their request to establish a cooperative was approved. In many areas, mutual aid teams are actively accumulating public property, purchasing new agricultural tools, studying and introducing books on the experience of establishing and running cooperatives, visiting old cooperatives, and inviting old cooperative cadres to give reports... preparing to establish cooperatives. The work teams can carry out the "four assessments" as soon as they enter the village for most of the mutual aid teams that request to establish cooperatives, and some mutual aid teams have even completed the "four assessments" during the preparatory period. Therefore, the work of establishing cooperatives this year has been particularly smooth. We plan to establish 305 new cooperatives this year. In September, in conjunction with the autumn harvest, we established 210 cooperatives (accounting for 70 percent of the plan for establishing cooperatives) in about twenty days.

    In the cooperative movement in the Hetao area, there are two major issues that must be paid special attention to.

    First, the overall plan for cooperation must be closely integrated with the plan for water conservancy construction.

    The Hetao area has flat terrain and fertile land, and all cultivated land relies on irrigation from the Yellow River. As the saying goes, "The Yellow River has a hundred harms, but only enriches the Hetao area." However, the biggest difficulty in agricultural production in the Hetao area is: large area of land with a small population, insufficient labor force, with an average of twelve mu of irrigated land per agricultural population. Due to the old water conservancy projects being controlled by feudal landlords, the irrigation channels are uneven, too curved, and silt up quickly; every year, opening new channels and repairing old ones becomes a huge burden for the masses. For example, the annual water fee burden for the main canals and large branch canals alone is equal to 30 to 40 percent of the agricultural tax. There are extremely numerous small branch canals. In some places, small branch canals that can only irrigate 20 to 30 mu of land account for more than 70 percent of the entire branch canals. Due to the excessive number of branch canals, the irrigation difficulties are further increased. Branch canals often cause disasters due to unstable canal mouths or negligent supervision, and 90 percent of the water disasters every year occur at the mouths of branch canals. There are even more disputes between regions over water distribution. The utilization of water is also uneven, with some places using too much water, causing soil alkalization, while other places are drought-stricken and lack water. However, the development of cooperation will provide favorable conditions for gradually solving these problems. Now, many cooperatives have carried out the work of straightening canals and merging several small branch canals into large branch canals (with smaller canals branching off from the branch canals). This can better exert the effectiveness of water conservancy equipment. For example, the Jian'an Canal in Langshan County is formed by the merging of fifteen small canals. In the past, fifteen people were too busy to irrigate the land, but now only a few people are enough. If you ask individual farmers what the benefits are of organizing cooperatives, they will first say: Cooperatives have more people and are better organized, so irrigation and cultivation are not delayed! It can be seen that the reform of the water conservancy system has become an important factor in promoting agricultural cooperation. However, there are still some water conservancy workers who have not integrated water conservancy construction with the cooperative movement. They only shout empty slogans about technical reform and do not summarize the experience of water conservancy reform created by the cooperatives. On the other hand, some cooperative cadres do not pay attention to combining the water conservancy creations of the masses with the scientific guidance of the water conservancy departments. Both of these ideas must be criticized. We must closely integrate the overall plan for cooperation with the overall plan for water conservancy work.

    Second, the Hetao area is an area where many ethnic groups live together. In the overall plan for cooperation, we must strengthen economic cooperation between Mongolians and Han Chinese, and closely integrate agriculture and animal husbandry.

    In the past, under the persecution of the reactionary ruling class of the Kuomintang, the broad masses of Mongolian working people suffered economic bankruptcy and lost their livestock. Although they were allocated land in the land reform, they did not know how to cultivate it. Then, how should the production of Mongolians in the Hetao area develop after the land reform? Some people advocate simply developing animal husbandry. This opinion is unrealistic. Because the vast majority of Mongolian residents have very few livestock or no livestock at all, it is difficult to maintain a living by relying solely on animal husbandry, let alone improve their lives. At the same time, we must also see that the Hetao area is an ideal agricultural area. With the construction of projects to control the harm of the Yellow River and develop Yellow River water conservancy, the cultivated area in the Hetao area will gradually expand year by year. Under such natural conditions, developing agriculture is more economically advantageous. Some people advocate free development, that is, "graze if you can graze, farm if you can farm." This is essentially an irresponsible approach. We believe that the correct production direction for the Mongolian people in the Hetao area must be: engage in agriculture, while taking into account animal husbandry, and combine agriculture and animal husbandry. The specific method is: vigorously organize mutual aid teams and cooperatives jointly participated in by Mongolians and Han Chinese. We should enable Mongolian and Han farmers to respect each other, learn from each other's strengths, and appropriately divide labor in mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Those who are good at herding should herd, and those who are good at farming should cultivate the land. In mutual aid and cooperative organizations, we must especially educate Han farmers to enthusiastically help Mongolian residents learn to cultivate the land. In recent years, the broad masses of Mongolian people have actively participated in mutual aid teams, and twenty-nine agricultural production cooperatives jointly formed by Mongolian and Han farmers have been established throughout the region. Therefore, the lives of the Mongolian people have been greatly improved. For example, there are six Mongolian households in Suhai Township, Linhe County, who joined the mutual aid team after liberation, and last winter they jointly established a cooperative with twenty-six Han farmers. Now, the Mongolian cooperative members have all learned to cultivate the land. The per-mu yield of their mutual aid team was 105 jin in 1952, 150 jin in 1953; after the establishment of the cooperative in the winter of 1954, the per-mu yield reached 237 jin in 1955. Three cooperative members including Halabudai had no land before liberation. After the land reform, they were allocated a total of 69 mu of irrigated land and five sheep. They started farming in 1952 and harvested nine shi of grain, harvested twenty shi of grain in 1953, and harvested forty shi of grain in 1954. It is estimated that they can be allocated more than forty shi of grain this year. Now, the livestock of their three households has also increased from 72 heads (including 60 sheep) before liberation to 135 heads (including 108 sheep). Mongolian cooperative member Halima said: "Participating in mutual aid teams and cooperatives, learning to cultivate the land, and animal husbandry have also developed. In the past, we had little to eat and nothing to wear, but now we have everything we want." In the cooperative movement in the Hetao area, we must pay great attention to the cooperatives jointly formed by Mongolian and Han farmers, and run these cooperatives well and in large numbers, to ensure the smooth development of agriculture and animal husbandry throughout the region.

### 河套地区合作化运动的两大特点

　　积极地有计划地开展农业合作化运动
　　河套地区合作化运动的两大特点
　　中共内蒙古自治区河套地委书记　郝平南
    内蒙古自治区河套专区一九五三年试办了八个农业生产合作社；一九五四年又办了四十八个社，达到区区有社；一九五五年办了四百五十七个社，入社农户达到总农户的百分之十八点七五，基本上达到乡乡有社。全区百分之九十五以上的合作社都增加了生产。
    今年河套地区的各级党委根据全面规划、加强领导的方针，重新制定了发展合作社的计划，根据各县、旗的计划，一九五五年冬季，全区入社户数在总农户中的比重将达百分之三十五，一九五六年冬季将达百分之七十，一九五七年冬季将达百分之七十五。并且，在一九五六、一九五七两年全区还将试办十至二十个高级形式的农业生产合作社。我们认为，这个任务是可以胜利地完成的。
    目前广大农民的社会主义积极性空前高涨。秋收之前，已经有不少互助组向乡支部提出了建社的要求。临河县委曾经收到四十多份农民要求建社的申请书。杭锦后旗一区区委副书记到沙沟乡的时候，群众把他围住不让走，质问他说：“去年推今年，今年推明年，到底什么时候建社？”达拉特后旗海子晏乡一个互助组的组员听说区委制定的今年建社计划里没有他们，立刻要互助组长骑马赶到区委会再次申请，最后他们建社的要求终于被批准了。在许多地区，互助组积极积累公共财产、购买新式农具、学习介绍建社办社经验的书籍、到老社参观、请老社干部报告……准备建社。绝大部分要求建社的互助组工作组一进村就可以进行“四评”，有的互助组在筹备期间连“四评”都作好了。因此，今年建社工作特别顺利。我们计划今年新建三百零五个社，九月间结合秋收，用了二十天左右的时间就建起了二百一十个社（占建社计划的百分之七十）。
    在河套地区的合作化运动中，有两个大问题，必须特别注意。
    第一、合作化的全面规划，必须同水利建设的规划密切结合起来。
    河套地区地势平坦，土地肥沃，全部耕地都靠引黄河的水灌溉。俗话说：“黄河百害，唯富一套。”但是，河套地区农业生产上最大的困难是：地多人少，劳力不足，每个农业人口平均有水地十二亩。由于旧的水利事业被封建地主操纵，灌溉渠道高低不平，弯曲太多，淤积快；每年开新挖旧，成为群众的巨大负担。例如，仅仅干渠和大支渠的每年水费负担，就等于农业税的百分之三十到四十。小支渠极其繁多，在有的地方，只能浇二、三十亩地的小支渠，竟占整个支渠的百分之七十以上。由于支渠过多，顾此失彼，更增加了灌溉上的困难。支渠常因渠口不固或看管不周而决口成灾，每年百分之九十的水灾都是在支渠口上发生的。至于地区之间因分水争吵的事情，就更多了。在水利的利用上也不均衡，有的地方用水过多，造成了土地的碱化，有的地方却干旱缺水。但是，合作化的发展将为逐渐解决这些问题，提供有利的条件。现在，不少合作社已经进行了渠道取直的工作，把若干小的支渠合并成大支渠（支渠下再开毛渠）。这样可以更好地发挥水利设备的效用。如狼山县的建安渠，就是由十五道小渠并成的，过去浇地时十五个人忙不过来，现在几个人就够了。如果问单干农民组织合作社有什么好处？他们首先会说：合作社人多组织好，灌溉耕耘两不误！可见，水利制度的改革已成为促进农业合作化的重要因素了。但是现在仍有一部分水利工作人员，没有把水利建设同合作化运动结合起来，他们只是空喊技术改革，对合作社已经创造出来的水利改革的经验不去总结。另一方面，也有一部分办社干部，不注意把群众在水利上的创造同水利部门的科学指导相结合。这两种思想都要批判。我们必须使合作化的全面规划同水利工作的全面规划紧密地结合起来。
    第二、河套是民族杂居地区，在合作化的全面规划中，必须加强蒙族汉族之间的经济合作，使农牧业密切结合。
    过去，广大蒙族劳动人民在国民党反动统治阶级的迫害下，经济破产，失掉了牲口，他们虽然在土地改革中分到了土地，但是不会耕种。那末，土地改革后的河套地区蒙族的生产究竟如何发展？有人主张单纯发展畜牧业。这种意见是不现实的。因为绝大多数的蒙族居民牲畜很少，或根本没有牲畜，因此，单靠畜牧业，势难维持生活，更谈不到改善生活了。同时，我们还要看到：河套是理想的农业区，随着根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的工程的建设，河套地区的耕地面积将逐年扩大。在这样的自然条件下，发展农业在经济上是更为有利的。有人主张自由发展，就是说，“能牧则牧，能农则农”。这实质上是一种不负责任的办法。我们认为河套地区蒙族人民正确的生产方向，必须是：从事农业，兼顾牧业，使农牧业结合。具体办法就是：大力组织蒙族和汉族共同参加的互助组和合作社。我们应当使蒙、汉族农民在互助合作组织中互相尊重，取长补短，适当分工，长于牧者放牧，长于农者种地。在互助合作组织中，特别要教育汉族农民热情地帮助蒙族居民学会种地。几年来，广大的蒙族人民积极参加了互助组，全区已建立了二十九个由蒙汉族农民联合组成的农业生产合作社。因此蒙族人民的生活有了很大的改善。如临河县宿亥乡有六户蒙族居民，解放后就参加了互助组，去冬又同二十六户汉族农民联合建立了合作社。现在，蒙族社员都学会了种地。他们所在的互助组的每亩产量，一九五二年是一百零五斤，一九五三年是一百五十斤；一九五四年冬建立合作社后，一九五五年每亩产量便达到了二百三十七斤。哈拉布代等三户社员，解放前地无一垅，土地改革后共分到水地六十九亩、羊五只。一九五二年他们开始种地，打了九石粮，一九五三年打了二十石粮，一九五四年就打了四十石粮，今年预计可分到四十多石粮。现在，他们三户的牲畜也由解放前的七十二头（其中羊六十只）增加到了一百三十五头（其中羊一百零八只）。蒙族社员哈利玛说：“参加互助组合作社，学会了种地，牧业也有了发展，过去少吃无穿，现在要什么有什么。”在河套地区的合作化运动中，必须十分重视蒙汉两族农民联合组成的合作社，把这种合作社办得又多又好，以保证全区农业和牧业的顺利发展。
