In Shenyang, design units, while ensuring the completion of this year's design tasks, have generally begun preparations for next year's infrastructure construction design work.

As of now, the design units have accepted more than 120 design projects for 1956, including the design of machinery and electrical manufacturing plants, coal mine shafts, highway bridges, as well as the design of factory welfare facilities, employee family dormitories, schools, warehouses, office buildings, and other projects. These projects are distributed throughout the country. To ensure the completion of survey and design tasks, the units are estimating workloads and balancing design forces, and making contact with construction units. The Fourth Design Branch of the First Ministry of Machine Building has been preparing for the 1956 survey and design plan since September this year, and has signed various data submission agreements and construction drawing delivery contracts with construction units, sending personnel to construction sites to collect data. In addition to making various preparations, the Coal Mine Design Institute is also assisting various mine construction units in preparing basic construction plans while reducing unnecessary construction projects. Preliminary calculations show that it has saved the state more than 5 million yuan in investment. The Shenyang City Design Office completed this year's design tasks in October. While collecting design data for next year, they have also sent some personnel to this year's construction sites to understand the design quality and savings effects over the past year, in order to summarize experiences and lessons, and better carry out next year's design work.

　　沈阳设计单位开始明年基建设计准备工作
    在沈阳市的各设计单位，在保证完成今年设计任务的同时，普遍着手进行明年基本建设的设计准备工作。
    到目前为止，各设计单位已接受的一九五六年设计项目，共达一百二十多项，包括机械和电器制造工厂的设计、煤矿矿井的设计、公路桥梁的设计以及厂区福利设施、职工家属宿舍、学校、仓库、办公楼等工程的设计。这些工程分布在全国各地。各单位为保证完成勘察设计任务，正估计工作量和平衡设计力量，同建设单位取得联系。第一机械工业部第四设计分局从今年九月起就已经着手进行一九五六年勘察设计计划的准备工作，并且同建设单位签订各项资料提交协议和设计交付施工图纸合同，派人赴建设现场搜集资料。煤矿设计院除已经进行各项准备外，还在协助各矿井建设单位编制基本建设计划的同时削减了不必要的建设项目，初步计算，已经给国家节约了五百多万元的投资。沈阳市设计处在十月份已经完成今年的设计任务，他们在着手搜集明年设计资料的同时，还派了一部分人员到今年的施工现场去了解一年来的设计质量和节约效果，以便总结经验教训，更好地进行明年的设计。
