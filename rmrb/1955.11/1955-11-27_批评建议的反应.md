Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the Business Section of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau: October 10th
  The criticism on the "Reader's Letters" page regarding the waste caused by the Jiamusi Branch under our bureau sending telegrams indiscriminately is completely correct. In addition to criticizing and educating the personnel involved, we are determined to learn from this lesson and prevent similar mistakes from happening again.
                    ×  ×  ×
    A letter from the Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 5: October 16th
  The "Reader's Letters" page criticized the frequent oil spills and chaotic management system in our factory's distillation workshop. We have conducted a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of the distillation workshop's work. Through this inspection, we have strengthened the leadership and management system of the distillation workshop, revised the operating procedures, established an oil recovery section, and built an oil recovery pool. We will continue to work hard to improve the work of this workshop in the future.

    A letter from the Organization Department of the Xingtai Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China:
  The "Reader's Letters" page on September 18th published a letter titled "Why are Normal School Students Being Reassigned to Other Jobs?", which criticized our mistaken practice of assigning normal school graduate Wang Xiufeng to a non-teaching job. We accept this criticism and guarantee that similar phenomena will not occur in the future.

    A letter from the Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Commerce:
  The "Reader's Letters" page on September 11th published a letter titled "10,000 Kilograms of Squid Mistakenly Shipped to Xinjiang", criticizing the irresponsible work style of the native produce warehouse of the Third Wholesale Department of the Xi'an Trading Company. The situation is completely accurate. We have decided to give Qi Guangyu, the person in charge of the native produce warehouse, a major demerit and Huang Fuhan, the person directly responsible, a dismissal.

    A letter from the Beijing Metal Crafts Factory accepting the criticism in the October 30th "Reader's Letters" page. In order to remedy the adverse effects caused by the poor quality of the Class One Labor Defense System medals, they have rushed to produce 180,000 copper medals to replace the zinc medals, and have decided to organize technical forces to continue research and experiments on the use of zinc instead of copper.
