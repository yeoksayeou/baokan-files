    Foreign Friends Talk About Their Impressions of Visiting China
    Indian Minister of Health, Kaur
    Indian Government Minister of Health, Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, expressed her impressions of her recent visit to China at a press conference in New Delhi on October 31st. She said that the Chinese people's "desire for friendship with India and their hope for peace are very sincere and obvious."
    Kaur said that China faces similar health problems to India. She also said: But the Chinese government "is working hard to solve these huge problems with practical methods, and has achieved many successes since liberation."
    She said that Chinese health authorities plan to adopt modern scientific medical systems and absorb the most valuable contributions of traditional Chinese medicine. She said that because India's treasure trove of traditional medicine is very rich, it would be beneficial to do the same in India.
    When talking about the state's care for people's health, she emphasized that China "gives great priority to rural health stations and care for women and children. In fact, care for children receives the highest priority from their earliest age." She said, "Great attention is also paid to physical exercise."
    She added that cleanliness is a remarkable achievement, and flies have been reduced to a minimum. She said she would recommend launching a fly eradication campaign in Delhi as well.
    Regarding the issue of women's rights, Kaur said that monogamy is stipulated by law. She also said that Chinese women are completely free, and their standards of morality and character are very high. She said that Chinese women enjoy equal status with men and have the opportunity to receive the same education as men.
    Secretary of the Burmese National Football Team
    U Than Swe, Secretary of the Burmese National Football Team, told reporters on October 29th upon returning to Rangoon from China: "The Burmese team learned a lot of advanced experience from this visit to China, and strengthened the unity between sports people of China and Burma and the friendship between the two peoples."
    U Than Swe said that from the friendly matches held in China this time, it can be seen that the progress of Chinese sports is amazing, and the skills and sportsmanship of Chinese players are very good. They are all strong, energetic, and adopt collective coordination, able to attack and defend, especially with short passes that are fast and accurate. He said that the progress of Chinese players can be so rapid because the government attaches great importance to the development of sports.
    Head of the British Friends Service Council Delegation
    According to the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on October 30th, Ronald W. Woods, head of the British Friends Service Council delegation, who visited China and returned home via Hong Kong, told reporters who interviewed him on October 29th about his impressions of New China: "The tragic scenes that people often saw in old China can no longer be seen."
    Woods visited China ten years ago. He said that the most impressive change in China today is the change in the people's spirit and attitude. China has many material changes, but the efforts made for progress are the most interesting. He also said that the Chinese are happier now than before, and they now have a goal.
    Woods said that the friendly atmosphere during the delegation's talks with Premier Zhou Enlai was exactly the same as the atmosphere they felt while traveling in China. He expressed satisfaction with the delegation's visit. Woods believes that there is religious freedom in China, and he praised the cleanliness and construction work in Chongqing, Chengdu and other places. (Xinhua News Agency)

    外国朋友谈访问我国的观感
    印度卫生部长考尔
    印度政府卫生部长拉·阿·考尔十月三十一日在新德里的记者招待会上发表了她最近访问中国的观感。她说，中国人民“希望和印度友好和希望和平的愿望是非常真诚和明显的”。
    考尔说，中国面临着同印度类似的卫生问题。她又说：但是中国政府“正在努力用实际的办法解决这些巨大的问题，解放以后，已经获得了许多成就”。
    她说，中国的卫生当局计划采用现代科学医疗制度，并且吸收中医的最有价值的贡献。她说，由于印度传统医学的宝藏十分丰富，在印度也这样做是会有好处的。
    她在谈到国家对人民健康的关怀时强调说，中国“乡村的保健站和对妇婴的照顾得到很大的优先权。事实上，对儿童的照顾从他们最幼小的时候起就得到最大的优先权了。”她说，“对体育锻炼也给予了极大的注意。”
    她又说，清洁是一个惊人的成就，苍蝇已减少到最小限度。她说她将建议在德里也展开灭蝇运动。
    关于妇女权利的问题，考尔说，一夫一妻制是法律规定。她又说，中国的妇女是完全自由的，她们的道德和品格的水准是很高的。她说，中国妇女享有同男子平等的地位，有和男子受同等教育的机会。
    缅甸国家足球代表团秘书
    缅甸国家足球代表团秘书吴丹岁十月二十九日在从中国回到仰光时对记者发表谈话说：“缅甸球队这次访问中国学到了很多先进经验，并且加强了中缅体育界人士之间的团结和两国人民之间的友谊。”
    吴丹岁说，从这次在中国举行的友谊比赛中可以看出，中国体育运动的进步是很惊人的，中国球员的技术和体育道德都非常好。他们个个身体强壮，气力充沛，采取集体联系，进能攻，退能守，尤其是短传快捷准确。他说，中国球员的进步能够这样迅速，是因为政府很重视开展体育运动的结果。
    英国公谊会代表团团长
    据香港“大公报”十月三十日报道，访问中国后取道香港回国的英国公谊会代表团团长伍德十月二十九日对访问他的记者们谈到他对新中国的印象说：“人们在旧中国经常看到的悲惨的景象，现在看不到了。”
    伍德在十年前曾经访问过中国。他说，目前中国给人印象最深的改变，是人民的精神和态度的改变。中国有许许多多物质上的改变，但是为进步而作出的努力是最令人感兴趣的。他又说，中国人现在比以前更加愉快了，他们现在有了一个目标。
    伍德说，代表团同周恩来总理谈话时的友好气氛同他们在游历中国时所感到的气氛完全一样。他对代表团的这次访问表示满意，伍德认为中国有宗教自由，并且对重庆、成都等地的清洁卫生工作和建设工作备加赞扬。　（据新华社讯）
