　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th. In the great development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in rural areas across the country are joining agricultural production cooperatives one after another. The number of rural martyr and military families joining cooperatives accounts for about 20 percent of their total number of households in rural areas, which is higher than the proportion of ordinary people joining cooperatives. The number of demobilized construction soldiers joining cooperatives nationwide has also accounted for more than 25 percent of those engaged in agricultural production. In a few counties and townships, the proportion of martyr and military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers joining cooperatives is over 90 percent. As of October 1, Ju'nan County, Shandong Province, the number of martyr and military families joining cooperatives accounted for 95.4 percent of their total number of households. In Sh窝乡 Township, Changqing County, Shandong Province, all martyr and military families and demobilized construction soldiers have joined cooperatives.
    The vast majority of martyr and military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in rural areas are poor and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants. They have an inseparable relationship with the People's Government and the People's Army. Therefore, they are determined to take the road of socialist cooperation. Zhang Jingxiu, a martyr's family member in Datang Township, Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province, said when Datang Township was promoting the establishment of cooperatives: "My son follows Chairman Mao, and I also follow Chairman Mao, and resolutely take the road of socialism." When Datang Township transitioned the first batch of mutual aid teams to cooperatives, he was the first to apply to join the cooperative. Many martyr and military families and former Red Army veterans in Jinggang Mountain and its surrounding areas often used the evenings to collectively study the draft model charter of agricultural production cooperatives during the establishment of cooperatives, and actively promoted it to the peasants. Some traveled back and forth two or three hundred miles across mountains to learn cooperative management experience from old cooperatives below Jinggang Mountain. Under their leadership, many peasants joined agricultural production cooperatives. Now, some basically cooperative villages have emerged in Jinggang Mountain and its surrounding areas. After Gao Yanli, a demobilized construction soldier from Dongguang County, Hebei Province, returned to his hometown, he took the lead in organizing an agricultural production cooperative. He used his production material subsidy to buy three cattle and some farm tools and seeds and invested them in the cooperative. When there was a shortage of food, he took the initiative to take out his own grain to help the nearby members. Because he often overworked, he fell ill four times, but even in his illness, he continued to lead the members to overcome difficulties and consolidate and develop the agricultural production cooperative. Now the agricultural production cooperative he leads has grown from 22 households to 180 households.
    Many martyr and military families, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have become leaders of agricultural production cooperatives. Among the demobilized construction soldiers in Shaanxi Province, 1,078 served as chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives. Ten percent of the martyr and military families participating in agricultural production cooperatives in Guangxi Province have become the backbone of the cooperatives.

　　烈属军属和复员军人积极加入农业合作社
    新华社十五日讯　在农业合作化运动的大发展中，全国农村中的革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人正在纷纷加入农业生产合作社。全国农村烈属、军属入社的户数已经占到他们在农村的总户数百分之二十左右，高于一般群众入社的比例。全国入社的复员建设军人也已经占到他们参加农业生产部分的百分之二十五以上。有少数县和乡的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人入社的比例在百分之九十以上。山东省莒南县到十月一日止，入社的烈属、军属占到了他们总户数的百分之九十五点四。山东省长清县石窝乡烈属、军属和复员建设军人已经全部入社。
    各地农村的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人绝大部分是贫农和新老中农中间的下中农，他们同人民政府和人民军队有着血肉不可分的关系。因此，他们坚决要求走社会主义合作化的道路。江西省兴国县大塘乡烈属张井秀在大塘乡宣传建社的时候说：“我儿子跟毛主席走，我也跟毛主席走，坚决走社会主义的道路。”大塘乡在第一批互助组转社的时候，他第一个申请入社。井冈山和其周围地区的许多烈属、军属和前工农红军老战士在建社时经常利用夜晚集体学习农业生产合作社示范章程草案，并且积极向农民宣传。有的爬山越岭往返两三百里到井冈山下面的老社学习办社经验。在他们的带动下，许多农民加入了农业生产合作社，现在，井冈山及其周围地区已经出现了一些基本合作化的乡村。河北省东光县复员建设军人高颜礼回乡以后，带头组织了一个农业生产合作社。他用自己的生产资料补助金买了三头牛和一部分农具、种子投入社内，在青黄不接的时候，又主动拿出自己的粮食接济旁的社员。由于他经常操劳过度，曾病了四次，可是他在病中也一直领导社员战胜困难，巩固和发展了农业生产合作社。现在他领导的农业生产合作社已由二十二户发展到一百八十户。
    许多烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人已经成为农业生产合作社的领导人员。陕西省复员建设军人中有一千零七十八人担任农业生产合作社社长。广西省参加农业生产合作社的烈属、军属有百分之十成为社的骨干力量。
