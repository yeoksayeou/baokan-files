School Teachers Should Actively Participate in Language Reform and Standardization of Chinese
    Lu Zhengyi, Deputy Director of the Primary Education Department of the Ministry of Education

    Language and writing are tools for people to exchange ideas, tools for social struggle, and also tools for teachers to carry out teaching activities. Teachers cannot carry out teaching work without language and writing. If teachers do not master the skills of using language and writing proficiently, it is impossible to effectively improve the quality of teaching.

    Chinese is one of the most developed and important languages ​​in the world, and Chinese writing symbols—Chinese characters—are one of the oldest and most widely influential scripts in history. No one can deny the contribution of Chinese and Chinese characters to the development of Chinese history and culture, nor can they deny the role of Chinese and Chinese characters in serving socialist construction and socialist transformation. However, in order to better serve socialist construction and socialist transformation with Chinese and Chinese characters, the standardization of Chinese and the reform of Chinese characters must be carried out. This is a nationally recognized conclusion and is already an urgent task in our country.

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "On New Democracy" long ago:

  "Writing must be reformed under certain conditions, and language must be close to the people." Comrade Mao Zedong instructed again in 1951: The reform of writing should follow the common phonetic direction of world writing; but before the realization of pinyinization, Chinese characters must first be simplified to facilitate current applications, and various research and preparation work for pinyinization must be carried out at the same time. The National Conference on Writing Reform focused on discussing the simplification of Chinese characters and the promotion of Putonghua based on the above instructions, exchanged views on the preparation for the realization of pinyinization, and passed eight resolutions. In order to correctly implement the resolutions of the National Conference on Writing Reform in schools at all levels, the Ministry of Education issued the "Notice on Promoting Simplified Chinese Characters in Schools at All Levels" and "Instructions on Vigorously Promoting Putonghua in Primary and Secondary Schools and Teacher Training Schools at All Levels." Teachers in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels across the country should actively undertake the tasks that they should undertake in the work of writing reform.

    As everyone knows, the complexity of Chinese characters is one of the reasons why the vast number of workers and peasants in the old society had difficulty accessing cultural and scientific knowledge. After liberation, the working class became the leading class of the country, and the worker-peasant alliance became the foundation of the country. However, due to the difficulty in recognizing, writing, and remembering Chinese characters, the majority of workers, peasants, and many cadres from worker and peasant backgrounds cannot quickly improve their cultural and scientific knowledge level. Our country's current school system requires twelve years to complete ordinary education subjects, and the quality of education is still far behind the Soviet Union's ten-year system school. The complexity of Chinese characters is one of the main reasons for this situation. Although the simplification of Chinese characters does not fundamentally reform Chinese characters, it cannot fundamentally solve the difficulties in literacy teaching, nor can it fundamentally relieve the heavy burden of children's education, adult education, and illiteracy elimination caused by the complexity of Chinese characters. However, promoting simplified Chinese characters in schools will play a certain positive role in improving teaching quality, and it is entirely certain that students can save a lot of time and energy by learning and using simplified Chinese characters. Students have always loved using simplified characters. Most teachers have also always welcomed simplified characters, but they were bound by a kind of traditional prejudice in the past. Some teachers often use simplified characters themselves, but restrict students from using simplified characters. Students are often given lower grades for writing simplified characters, and teachers are often seen as having low teaching quality for using simplified characters. This method of assessing academic performance and evaluating teaching effectiveness based on writing traditional characters or simplified characters should be completely abolished. We should not let the vitality of the new generation be wasted on writing traditional characters in vain. We should give young people, teenagers, and children more time to exercise, study, participate in various extracurricular activities, and public welfare labor. The Ministry of Education stipulates that: "The teaching, student assignments, daily writing, announcements, letters, etc. in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels across the country, as well as worker-peasant spare time schools, must use simplified Chinese characters." This measure is fully in line with the educational policy of all-round development, fully in line with the purpose of improving the quality of education, and fully in line with the requirements of socialist construction. Teachers across the country should actively strive to promote simplified Chinese characters.

    Modern Chinese, on the one hand, has considerable dialectal divergence and large regional differences; on the other hand, it has gradually formed a common language of the Han nationality, which is Putonghua based on the Northern dialect and Beijing pronunciation as the standard sound. Due to dialectal divergence, there are great difficulties in communication between people in different regions. The continuous development of social life requires changing this situation, and Putonghua has gradually formed. Due to the formation of Putonghua, the social communication effectiveness of Chinese has gradually increased. The gradual expansion of the use of Putonghua and the gradual reduction of the use of dialects is an inevitable trend of historical development, but in the past, there was a lack of organized leadership and overall planning for the promotion of Putonghua.

    Teachers have a direct responsibility for teaching students to speak Putonghua with Beijing pronunciation. Due to their age, primary and secondary school students have the most sensitive hearing, the most flexible vocal organs and various tissues, and are particularly easy to learn languages. Students rely on the help of language and writing to accept cultural and scientific knowledge. Whether a person's language is precise, whether it conforms to grammar and logic, and whether the vocabulary is rich, is a manifestation of whether the person's thinking is precise and whether the knowledge is rich. In the past, language teaching in schools focused on the interpretation of language and writing, and did not pay attention to language training for students, nor did it pay attention to arming students with basic knowledge of systematic language rules, resulting in students often making grammatical and logical errors in their writing, and even some university students cannot write fluent articles. To completely change this situation, it is necessary to improve language teaching based on fundamentally reforming Chinese characters and realizing the standardization of Chinese. Teachers using Putonghua for teaching and teaching students to speak Putonghua can not only provide students with better communication tools for engaging in various construction works after graduation, but also enable students to better exert their talents, and also promote the early realization of Chinese character reform and Chinese standardization. Teachers in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels should actively promote Putonghua and use Putonghua for teaching in order to improve the quality of teaching and promote the reform of writing. For teachers in dialect areas, there will be more difficulties in using Putonghua for teaching; but as long as they truly realize that this is closely related to cultivating socialist talents for the country and closely related to the cause of socialist construction, they will have the confidence and perseverance to overcome difficulties. With the confidence and perseverance to overcome difficulties, all difficulties can be solved easily.

    School teachers should not only teach students to use simplified characters and speak Putonghua, and not only promote the reform of writing and realize the standardization of Chinese by improving language teaching, but also actively participate in social publicity work regarding the promotion of simplified Chinese characters and the promotion of Putonghua. School students not only receive education and influence from teachers, but also receive education and influence from families and society. School education must not be isolated from society, and school language education must not be unrelated to the language and writing used daily in society. In order to make the masses like to use simplified Chinese characters and be happy to speak Putonghua; in order to obtain the support of students' parents and encourage students to use simplified characters and speak Putonghua, teachers should actively participate in social publicity work for promoting simplified Chinese characters and promoting Putonghua.

    School teachers can also participate in other work related to writing reform according to their own conditions, such as continuing to collect simplified characters, investigating dialects, and conducting research on the teaching effects of phonetic writing and Chinese characters. The simplified characters created by the masses in various places have not yet been fully collected, and after the promotion of simplified Chinese characters, the masses will create more simplified characters. If teachers in various schools can collect the simplified characters created by the masses at any time and send them to the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, it will be of great help to completing the work of simplifying Chinese characters. In the process of learning Putonghua and using Putonghua for teaching, if teachers in various places can record the corresponding rules between local sounds and Beijing pronunciation and send them to the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences or the Chinese Writing Reform Committee, it will also be of great help to completing the work of investigating dialects. It has been generally recognized that phonetic writing is superior to Chinese characters. It is not difficult to predict that after the pinyinization of Chinese writing, the quality of school education, especially primary school education, will be significantly improved, and the length of primary school education will also be shortened; however, changing from Chinese characters to phonetic writing will bring about many new problems in teaching. After the Chinese Writing Reform Committee publishes the pinyin scheme, we should immediately conduct teaching experiments on phonetic writing and comparative research on the teaching effects of phonetic writing and Chinese characters. The conduct of this work needs to be actively supported and helped by teachers.

    The work of reforming Chinese characters and realizing the standardization of Chinese is an important part of the socialist construction cause. Reforming Chinese characters is a necessary condition for realizing the socialist cultural revolution. To complete the work of Chinese character reform and Chinese standardization, writing reformers, language workers, literary and art workers, educators, and the broad masses of people must actively participate, work together, and cooperate with each other. Teachers are people who use language and writing to conduct teaching labor. Teachers have a direct responsibility for educating students to master the knowledge, skills, and proficiency in using language and writing. The convening of the National Conference on Writing Reform and the resolutions of the National Conference on Writing Reform have paved the way for the fundamental reform of Chinese writing. The Ministry of Education's "Notice on Promoting Simplified Chinese Characters in Schools at All Levels" and "Instructions on Vigorously Promoting Putonghua in Primary and Secondary Schools and Teacher Training Schools at All Levels" have officially included the work of writing reform in the school's work agenda. Teachers in primary and secondary schools and teacher training schools at all levels across the country should actively strive to take on their responsibilities.

　　学校教师应该积极参加文字改革和汉语规范化工作
　　教育部小学教育司副司长　卢正义
    语言文字是人们交流思想的工具，是社会斗争的工具，同时也是教师进行教学活动的工具。教师离开了语言文字，就不可能进行教学工作。教师如果不熟练地掌握使用语言文字的技能，就不可能有效地提高教学质量。
    汉语是世界最发达最重要的语言之一，汉语的书写符号——汉字是历史最长久、影响最广泛的文字之一。谁也不能否认汉语和汉字对中国历史文化发展的功绩，不能否认汉语和汉字在为社会主义建设和社会主义改造服务中的作用。但为了使汉语和汉字为社会主义建设和社会主义改造服务得更好些，汉语必须规范化，汉字必须改革，已经是全国公认的定论，并且已经是我国当前迫切的任务了。
    毛泽东同志在“新民主主义论”里早就指出：
  “文字必须在一定条件下加以改革，言语必须接近民众。”毛泽东同志在一九五一年又指示：文字改革要走世界文字共同的拼音方向；但在实现拼音化以前，首先必须简化汉字，以利目前的应用，同时进行拼音化的各项研究工作和准备工作。全国文字改革会议根据上述的指示，着重讨论了简化汉字、推广普通话问题，对于实现拼音化的准备工作问题交换了意见，并通过了八项决议。教育部为了在各级学校中正确地贯彻执行全国文字改革会议决议，发出了“关于在各级学校中推行简化汉字的通知”和
  “关于在中、小学和各级师范学校中大力推广普通话的指示”。全国中、小学和各级师范学校教师都应该积极地担负起自己在文字改革工作中应该担负的任务。
    大家知道，汉字的繁难，是使广大的工农群众，在旧社会里很难接近文化科学知识的原因之一。解放以后，工人阶级成了国家的领导阶级，工农联盟成了国家的基础，但也由于汉字的难认、难写、难记，使多数的工农群众和不少工农出身的干部，不能迅速地提高自己的文化科学知识水平。我国现行学制需要十二年才能修完普通的教育学科，教育质量还远远落后于苏联十年制学校，汉字的繁难就是造成这种情况的主要原因之一。汉字简化虽然不是从根本上改革汉字，因此还不能从根本上解决识字教学上的困难，不可能根本解除由于汉字繁难所造成的儿童教育、成人教育和扫除文盲工作的沉重负担。但在学校中推行简化汉字，对提高教学质量将起一定的积极作用，学生学习和使用简化汉字，时间和精力可以节省很多，却是完全可以肯定的。学生是一向爱用简体字的。大多数教师也一向欢迎简体字，只是过去被一种传统的成见所束缚，有些教师往往一面自己用简体字，一面又限制学生用简体字。学生常常因为写了简体字而被降低了学业成绩，教师也常常因为用了简体字而被看成教学质量不高。这种根据写繁体字或者写简体字评定学业成绩和考核教学效果的办法是完全应该废除的。我们不应该让新的一代的生命活力白白地浪费在写繁体字上。我们应该使青年、少年和儿童们有更多的时间用去锻炼身体、钻研学问、参加各种课外活动和公益劳动。教育部规定：“全国中、小学和各级师范学校以及工农业余学校的教学、学生作业和日常书写、布告、函件等，必须使用简化汉字。”这一措施，完全符合全面发展的教育方针，完全符合提高教育质量的目的，也完全符合社会主义建设的要求。全国教师应该为推行简化汉字而积极努力。
    现代汉语，一方面，方言相当分歧，地区的差别性很大；另一方面，已经逐渐形成一种汉民族共同语，这就是以北方话为基础方言、以北京语音为标准音的普通话。由于方言分歧，不同地区的人们之间的交往存在着很大困难。社会生活的不断发展，要求改变这种情况，普通话就逐渐形成。由于普通话的形成，汉语的社会交际效能就逐步提高。这种普通话使用范围的逐渐扩大和方言使用范围的逐渐缩小，是历史发展的必然趋势，只是过去对推广普通话还缺少有组织的领导和全面规划罢了。
    教师对于教学生用北京语音说普通话，担负着直接的责任。中、小学学生由于年龄的关系，听觉最灵敏，发音器官和各种组织最灵活，特别容易学习语言。学生是依靠语言文字的帮助接受文化科学知识的。一个人的语言是否精密，是否合乎文法和逻辑，语汇是否丰富，就是这个人的思想是否精密、知识是否丰富的表现。过去，学校的语文教学偏重于语言文字的解释，不重视对学生进行语言训练，不重视以系统的语言规律的基本知识武装学生，结果使学生的写作经常发生语法和逻辑上的错误，甚至有些大学生还写不出通顺的文章。彻底改变这种情况，需要在根本改革汉字和实现汉语规范化的基础上改进语文教学。教师用普通话教学，教学生学会说普通话，不仅可以使学生毕业后从事各项建设工作有了更好的交际工具，而且可以使学生能更好地发挥自己的才能，同时也会促进汉字改革和汉语规范化的早日实现。中、小学和各级师范学校的教师，为提高教学质量，为促进文字改革，应该积极地推广普通话，用普通话教学。对方言地区的教师来说，用普通话教学，会遇到较多的困难；但只要真正认识到这和为国家培养社会主义的人材有着密切的关系，和社会主义建设事业有着密切的关系，就会产生克服困难的信心和毅力。有了克服困难的信心和毅力，一切困难便都可以迎刃而解。
    学校教师不但要教学生用简体字，说普通话，不但要通过改进语文教学来促进文字改革和实现汉语规范化，而且应该积极地参加关于推行简化汉字和推广普通话的社会宣传工作。学校学生不只是从教师那里接受教育和影响，而且还从家庭和社会接受教育和影响。学校教育决不能孤立在社会之外，学校的语文教育也决不能跟社会日常使用的语言文字不发生关系。为了使群众喜爱用简化汉字，乐于说普通话；为了获得学生家长的支持，并鼓励学生用简体字，说普通话，教师应该积极参加推行简化汉字和推广普通话的社会宣传工作。
    学校教师还可以根据自己的条件参加有关文字改革的其他工作，如继续收集简体字、调查方言、进行拼音文字和汉字教学效果的研究等。各地群众创造的简体字，现在并没有完全收集起来，推行简化汉字之后，群众还要创造更多的简体字。各地学校教师如果能随时收集群众创造的简体字，把它寄给中国文字改革委员会，对完成简化汉字的工作会有很大帮助。各地教师在学习普通话和用普通话教学的过程当中，如果能把地方音和北京语音的对应规律记录下来，把它寄给中国科学院语言研究所或者中国文字改革委员会，对于完成调查方言的工作也会有很大帮助。拼音文字比汉字优越，已经为人们所公认。不难预料，中国文字拼音化之后，学校教育质量特别是小学教育质量将会显著提高，小学修业年限也将因而缩短；但从汉字改变为拼音文字，在教学上将会产生不少新的问题。在中国文字改革委员会发表拼音方案之后，我们应该立即进行关于拼音文字的教学试验和关于拼音文字跟汉字教学效果的比较研究，这一工作的进行需要得到教师们的积极支持和帮助。
    改革汉字和实现汉语规范化的工作，是社会主义建设事业中的重要的一环。改革汉字是实现社会主义的文化革命的必要条件。要完成汉字改革和汉语规范化的工作，必须文字改革工作者、语言工作者、文艺工作者、教育工作者和广大的人民群众积极参加，共同努力，分工合作。教师是使用语言文字进行教学劳动的人。教师在教育学生掌握使用语言文字的知识、技能和熟练技巧方面担负着直接的责任。全国文字改革会议的召开和全国文字改革会议的决议，为中国文字的根本改革开辟了道路。教育部“关于在各级学校中推行简化汉字的通知”和“关于在中、小学和各级师范学校中大力推广普通话的指示”把文字改革工作正式列入了学校工作的日程。全国中、小学校和各级师范学校教师应该积极努力，把自己的责任担负起来。
