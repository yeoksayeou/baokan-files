　　The Iron Plinth Caused a Big Problem
    The machine installation workers at the busy Jining North Station, in order to ensure the timely opening of through transport between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia, were so busy that they didn't even have time to rest on Sundays. By the beginning of November, it looked like most of the machines were about to be installed. One day, the workers were busily installing the largest machine—an air hammer—when suddenly, the work stopped. It turned out that the plinth on the air hammer was thirty centimeters too high, and it couldn't be matched with the air hammer. Everyone was very anxious and immediately sent a telegram to the manufacturer of the air hammer—Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant. The plant sent three workers to come and, after studying it for a long time, they had to dismantle the air hammer that had just been installed and saw off the extra thirty centimeters of the plinth.
    Why did Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant manufacture such substandard machinery? It turned out that the factory thought the plinth was a simple iron墩子 (dūnzi, a low stool or block) and did not test it with the air hammer before it left the factory. They never expected that such a simple iron墩子 would waste 140 workdays and 700 yuan in wages and travel expenses for the country. What was particularly serious was that the air hammer installation plan, which was supposed to be completed by the beginning of November, had to be postponed to December. If the air hammer is not installed properly, the ground leveling and other civil engineering projects will also have to be postponed.

　　铁鉔子带来了大问题
    在集宁北站紧张施工的机械安装工人，为了保证中、苏、蒙三国按期通车联运，忙得连星期天都顾不上休息。到十一月初，眼看大部分机器都要安装好了。有一天，工人们正紧张地安装最大的一部机器——空气锤，忽然，工作停下来了。原来是空气锤上的鉔子高出三十公分，同气锤配不在一起。大家非常着急，马上给空气锤的制造者——沈阳重型机器厂打了个电报，厂方派了三个工人赶来，研究半天，只好把刚安起的空气锤拆卸，把鉔子多余的三十公分锯去。
    为什么沈阳重型机器厂会制造出这种不合格的机器呢？原来是：厂方认为鉔子是一个简单的铁墩子，出厂时没跟气锤在一块试验。却没想到这么一个简单的铁墩子就给国家浪费了一百四十个工，工资、路费等七百元。特别严重的是眼看十一月初就要完成的空气锤安装计划，只好拖到十二月份去了。空气锤安装不好，打地平等土建工程也只好往后挪了。
