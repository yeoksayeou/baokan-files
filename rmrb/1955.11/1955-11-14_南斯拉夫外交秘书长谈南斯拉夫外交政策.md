Xinhua News Agency, Prague, December 12th: According to a Belgrade dispatch from the Yugoslav News Agency: Yugoslav Foreign Secretary Popović made a report on Yugoslav foreign policy at a joint session of the two houses of the Federal National Assembly on the 11th.

　　Popović said that in the current year, Yugoslavia has continued to make great efforts to implement a policy of active coexistence in order to promote the relaxation of international tensions as much as possible. Yugoslavia has consistently strived to resolve its disputes with other countries, especially with its neighbors, through negotiations and consultations.

　　Popović stressed that in the past year, there have been significant changes in the Cold War policy. "We believe that the constructive direction already known as the 'Geneva spirit' cannot be eliminated from the world."

　　Popović said: Yugoslavia has achieved significant achievements in its foreign policy by adhering to these principles in the past year, especially in its relations with the Soviet Union. In this regard, the visit of Soviet politicians to Belgrade played a significant role. President Tito has accepted the Soviet invitation to visit the Soviet Union, and this visit will powerfully demonstrate the determination of the two governments to continue to follow the path indicated in the joint Soviet-Yugoslav declaration in terms of bilateral relations and international cooperation. Popović then spoke about the improvement of Yugoslavia's relations with Eastern European countries.

　　When talking about the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, Popović said: There is no doubt that any agreement on the gradual elimination of current divisions in Europe, or even partial results in the limitation of armaments, would constitute an extremely significant contribution to further improving the international situation and would create conditions for the smooth resolution of other international problems.

　　In his report, Popović also spoke about Yugoslavia's relations with Western countries. He said that the friendly relations between Yugoslavia and the United States have continued to develop smoothly this year. The two governments continue to adopt the method of exchanging views on various issues of common concern on an equal footing. Yugoslavia is determined to continue to strengthen its policy of maintaining independence in all aspects, thereby helping to further improve and ease the world situation.

　　Popović pointed out that relations with other European countries have developed in a spirit of mutual understanding, and Western European countries are Yugoslavia's main markets. He hoped that Western Europe will continue to be an important partner for Yugoslavia in its economic relations with foreign countries.

　　When talking about Yugoslavia's relations with Asian countries, Popović said: Yugoslavia is pleased to note the active role played by these countries in international life, because Yugoslavia is linked to these countries by a common effort to maintain peace.

　　Popović said that Yugoslavia was one of the first countries to recognize the People's Republic of China as early as October 1949. Although the people of these two countries are geographically far apart, they have many things in common, whether in the struggle for independence and freedom, or in the efforts to get rid of economic backwardness and maintain world peace.

　　南斯拉夫外交秘书长谈南斯拉夫外交政策
    新华社布拉格十二日电　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫外交秘书长波波维奇十一日在联邦国民议会两院联席会议上作了关于南斯拉夫外交政策的报告。
    波波维奇说，在今年，南斯拉夫继续作了巨大努力实行积极共处政策，以求尽可能促进国际紧张局势的缓和。南斯拉夫始终不渝地努力用谈判和协商的方式来解决它同其他国家、主要是同它的邻邦的纠纷。
    波波维奇着重指出，这一年来，冷战政策已经有了重大的改变。“我们相信，已被称为‘日内瓦精神’的建设性方向是不能够从世界上被消除掉的。”
    波波维奇说：南斯拉夫在外交政策方面奉行着这些原则，在过去一年中已经获得重大的成就，特别是在同苏联的关系上。在这方面，苏联政治家到贝尔格莱德的访问起了重大的作用。铁托总统已经接受苏联邀他访问苏联的建议，这次访问将有力地说明两国政府具有决心在两国关系上和国际合作方面继续遵循苏南两国联合宣言所指出的道路。波波维奇接着谈到了南斯拉夫同东欧国家的关系改善的情况。
    波波维奇在谈到日内瓦外长会议时说：毫无疑问，关于逐渐消除目前在欧洲方面的分歧的任何协议，甚至在限制军备方面的局部的结果，都会构成对进一步改进国际局势的极有意义的贡献，并且会为顺利地解决其他国际问题创造条件。
    波波维奇在报告中也谈到了南斯拉夫同西方国家的关系。他说，南斯拉夫和美国的友好关系在这一年来仍然发展得很顺利。两国政府继续采用以平等地位对各种共同有关问题交换意见的办法。南斯拉夫决心继续加强在一切方面保持独立的政策，从而帮助进一步改善和缓和世界局势。
    波波维奇指出，同欧洲其他国家的关系是本着相互了解的精神发展的，西欧国家是南斯拉夫的主要市场。他希望西欧将继续是南斯拉夫在同外国的经济关系方面的一个重要的伙伴。
    在谈到南斯拉夫同亚洲国家的关系时，波波维奇说：南斯拉夫满意地注意到这些国家在国际生活中所起的积极作用，因为南斯拉夫是由于维护和平的共同努力而同这些国家联系在一起的。
    波波维奇说，南斯拉夫是早在一九四九年十月承认中华人民共和国的第一批国家中的一个国家。这两个国家的人民虽然在地理上相隔很远，但是，不论是在争取独立和自由的斗争方面，还是在致力于摆脱经济落后状态和维护世界和平的努力方面，他们有许多共同之处。
