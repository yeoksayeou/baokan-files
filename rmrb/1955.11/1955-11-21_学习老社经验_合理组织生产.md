Learning from Experienced Cooperatives: Rationally Organizing Production

Editor:

Our agricultural production cooperative was established in early October this year, after the township conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions on agricultural cooperation. The primary task after the cooperative was formed was to mobilize and organize the masses to do a good job of rushing the harvest and winter planting. However, due to a lack of experience in collectively leading production, the cooperative committee members and I were extremely busy, but the work was still not going well. We were truly like ants on a hot pan, anxiously at a loss.

What to do? We could only humbly learn from the experienced cooperatives. The Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in our village has a lot of experience, and their production is well-organized. So, I went to them. The cadres of the Hongguang Cooperative warmly and patiently helped us. They explained in detail their experience in forming production teams and groups and formulating production plans. This increased our confidence in running the cooperative. We quickly divided the entire cooperative into three production brigades and six production teams, delineated the cultivated areas, and stipulated the method of recording work points and evaluation. Production immediately had a direction.

With reasonable organization, the enthusiasm of the cooperative members for production increased greatly. From the end of October, male members invested themselves in the rush harvest campaign to get every grain home. Female members ensured careful and detailed planting, preserving the winter seedlings. More than one hundred male and female members went to work in the fields every day, working early and returning late, with high efficiency. At present, all 290 mu of late double-cropping rice in the cooperative have been harvested, and dozens of mu of barley and rapeseed and other crops have been quickly planted. The members have proactively invested 20,000 jin of ash fertilizer and are preparing to invest cash to buy manure fertilizer. Everyone is determined to strive for an increase of 50,000 jin of grain next year.

### 学习老社经验　合理组织生产

　　学习老社经验　合理组织生产编辑同志：
    我们的农业生产合作社是在今年十月初乡里传达毛主席关于农业合作化的指示之后建立起来的。社建成后的首要任务是发动和组织群众做好抢收和冬种。但是，由于缺乏领导集体生产的经验，我和社务委员们忙得团团转，工作还是搞不好。我们真是像热锅上的蚂蚁一样，急得没有办法了。
    怎么办呢？只有虚心地向老社学习。我们村里的红光农业生产合作社经验多，生产搞得有条有理，我就找他们去了。红光社的干部热情而耐心地帮助了我们，他们详细地介绍了编队编组和订生产计划的经验。这使我们提高了办社的信心。我们很快地把全社编成三个生产大队和六个生产小组，划定了耕作区，规定了记工评分的办法，生产马上有了头绪了。
    有了合理的组织工作，社员们生产劲头就大了。从十月底起，男社员投入了争取颗粒还家的抢收运动；女社员保证精作细种，保全冬苗。每天下地干活的男女社员有一百多人，大家早出晚归，效率很高。目前全社二百九十亩双季晚稻已经抢收完毕，同时抢种了几十亩大麦和油菜籽等作物。社员们主动投资二万斤灰肥，还准备投资现金买粪肥。大家决心要为明年增产五万斤粮食而努力。
