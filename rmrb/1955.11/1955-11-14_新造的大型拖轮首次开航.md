　　Newly Built Large Tugboat Sets Sail for the First Time

　　The newly built large tugboat "Quxia," of the joint state-private Minsheng Shipping Company, was completed five days ahead of schedule and set sail for the first time on October 27th. The Quxia is 163 feet long, 29 feet wide, and has a draft of 7 feet 6 inches, and can carry 300 tons of cargo. This tugboat can navigate the rapid and shoal-filled Sichuan River in all seasons and can tow two "柒" series iron barges and one "伍" series iron barge, carrying more than 2,400 tons of cargo each time.

　　The Quxia was built by the Chongqing Ship Repair and Building Factory of the Minsheng Shipping Company. Except for the boiler, which was salvaged from the Yiling, the tugboat's main engine, auxiliary engine, hull, technical equipment, and all other equipment were manufactured by this factory.

　  新造的大型拖轮首次开航
    公私合营民生轮船公司新造的大型拖轮——瞿峡轮，已经提前五天出厂，并在十月二十七日首次开航。瞿峡轮长一百六十三呎，宽二十九呎，吃水七呎六吋，能载三百吨重的货物。这艘拖轮能在滩多水急的川江中四季航行，并能拖带柒字头铁驳两只、伍字头铁驳一只，每次可载货物二千四百多吨。
    瞿峡轮是由民生轮船公司重庆船舶修造厂建造的。除了锅炉是利用打捞起来的彝陵轮的锅炉外，拖轮的主机、副机、轮壳、技术装备以及其他一切设备，都是由这个厂制造的。（郝炎午）
