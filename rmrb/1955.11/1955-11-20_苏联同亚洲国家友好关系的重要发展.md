　　Editorial: Important Development of Friendly Relations Between the Soviet Union and Asian Countries
    At the invitation of the Government of the Republic of India, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and the Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, have arrived in India for a friendly visit. After visiting India, the Soviet leaders will also visit the Union of Burma and the Kingdom of Afghanistan at their invitation.
    The Soviet leaders' visits to India, Burma, and Afghanistan are events of great significance internationally. Comrade N.A. Bulganin, First Vice-Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, said in his report at the meeting in Moscow celebrating the 38th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution on November 6:
  “We believe that the forthcoming visits of Comrades N.A. Bulganin and N.S. Khrushchev to great India, Burma, and Afghanistan will further strengthen the friendship between the Soviet people and the people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan, and the people of the East." This shows that the Soviet government and people attach great importance to the friendship with the people of Asian countries, and will further strengthen the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, Afghanistan, and other peace-loving Asian countries, thereby promoting the consolidation of peace in Asia and the world. Bulganin and Khrushchev's arrival in India, greeted by an unprecedentedly grand welcome from the Indian government and the broad masses of the Indian people, also demonstrates the Indian people's consistent and profound friendship with the Soviet people, and reflects the sincere desire of the peace-loving people of Asian countries to carry out international friendly cooperation with the Soviet people.
    Ensuring peace and safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of all countries has always been the main goal of Soviet foreign policy. The people of India, Burma, and Afghanistan have received the friendly support and sympathy of the Soviet people in their struggle for national independence and in their efforts to consolidate international peace and security. Solid friendly and cooperative relations have long been established between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan. In recent years, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India and Burma have developed greatly in the common struggle to strive for peace and eliminate international tension. In particular, this year, Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu successively visited the Soviet Union and respectively issued joint statements with Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Bulganin, proving the consistent views of the Soviet Union, India, and Burma on many major international issues, which has further laid a solid foundation for the friendly cooperation between the Soviet Union and India and Burma. Prime Minister Nehru said at a mass rally in Moscow: “As long as there is no mutual interference and no forced attempt to dominate the other, there is no reason why countries with different political, social or economic systems cannot cooperate in this way." Prime Minister U Nu stated at a gathering in Moscow: “Let me declare on behalf of my country that in our common desire to strive for the independence of colonies, in our efforts to strive for world peace, we will unite with the Soviet Union." The increasingly enhanced friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan are built on the reliable foundation of this common desire to respect national independence and national sovereignty, maintain peace, and promote international cooperation.
    In the joint statements issued separately by the heads of the Soviet-Indian and Soviet-Burmese governments, the principles of peaceful coexistence were affirmed as the criteria for the development of Soviet-Indian and Soviet-Burmese relations now and in the future. These principles are: mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The joint statements by the heads of the Soviet-Indian and Soviet-Burmese governments emphasized that these principles can serve as a common program for the people of all countries in the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace. As long as all countries are willing to accept and are determined to abide by these principles, the trust and cooperation between countries can be strengthened, and it will greatly help to ease international tensions. The rapid development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India and Burma fully confirms this point.
    In the friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan, developing economic and cultural ties with each other based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit is an extremely important factor. The Soviet-Indian agreement signed between the Soviet Union and India in February this year is an example of establishing friendly relations on the basis of such principles of equality and mutual benefit. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union provides India with long-term loans at very low interest rates to build a steel plant with an annual output of one million tons of steel, and provides technical assistance. The Soviet Union and Burma have also concluded a trade agreement. The Soviet Union will export to Burma the industrial equipment it urgently needs in exchange for rice and other commodities that Burma is eager to sell. The trade relations between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan have been developing normally. The Soviet Union has helped Afghanistan build some factories that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and has assisted it in urban and transportation construction. The important characteristics of expanding economic ties between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan are: the Soviet Union not only does not attach any political conditions, and conducts trade on the basis of genuine equality and mutual benefit; but also supplies them with complete sets of factory equipment, provides loans and raw materials, and dispatches first-class technical experts to help them with construction. Prime Minister U Nu said at a press conference in Moscow: “The Soviet Union is the first country to agree to provide Burma with technical assistance according to the conditions proposed by Burma."
    The expansion of economic and cultural ties between India, Burma, Afghanistan and the Soviet Union is undoubtedly conducive to their respective national economic and cultural construction, and has an important impact on their efforts to strive for economic independence and improve people's lives.
    For many centuries, the people of Asian countries have been subjected to cruel colonial oppression and exploitation, and have been in a state of poverty and backwardness. Now, many Asian countries have broken free from the shackles of colonialism and embarked on the road of independence and revival. In the struggle of the people of Asian countries to strive for their own national independence and eliminate the scourge of colonialism, in the struggle to build their own countries and get rid of poverty and backwardness, and in the struggle to maintain peace and strengthen international cooperation, they are increasingly clearly aware that the Soviet people are the loyal friends of the people of Asian countries. Establishing and developing friendly and cooperative relations with the Soviet people is entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the people of Asian countries.
    The friendly visits of the Soviet government leaders to India, Burma, and Afghanistan are important milestones on the road to strengthening peaceful cooperation between the Soviet Union and Asian countries, and will be warmly welcomed by the peace-loving people of Asian countries and progressive mankind all over the world. The Chinese people, with feelings of infinite joy, welcome the visits of the Soviet government leaders to Asian countries, welcome the further development of friendly and cooperative relations between the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan, and welcome the important efforts made by the Soviet Union and India, Burma, and Afghanistan to promote peace in Asia and the world.

### 苏联同亚洲国家友好关系的重要发展

　　苏联同亚洲国家友好关系的重要发展
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫，应印度共和国政府的邀请，已经到达印度进行友好访问。在访问印度之后，苏联的领袖们还将应邀到缅甸联邦共和国和阿富汗王国作友好访问。
    苏联领袖的访问印度、缅甸和阿富汗，是国际上一件具有重大意义的事件。苏联部长会议第一副主席卡冈诺维奇十一月六日在莫斯科庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年大会上的报告中说：
  “我们相信：尼·亚·布尔加宁同志和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同志的即将访问伟大的印度、缅甸和阿富汗，将会促使苏联人民同印度、缅甸、阿富汗三国人民，同东方人民之间的友谊得到进一步的加强。”这表现了苏联政府和人民十分重视同亚洲国家人民间的友谊，并将进一步加强苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗以及其他亚洲爱好和平国家间的友好关系，从而促进亚洲和世界和平的巩固。布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫到达印度，受到印度政府和印度广大人民盛况空前的欢迎，同样表现了印度人民对苏联人民一贯的深厚友谊，也反映了亚洲各国爱好和平人民热烈要求和苏联人民进行国际友好合作的真诚愿望。
    保障和平和维护各国人民的独立主权，一向是苏联外交政策的主要目标。印度、缅甸和阿富汗人民在争取自己民族独立的斗争中，在巩固国际和平与安全的努力中，都得到了苏联人民的友好支持和同情。苏联和阿富汗之间早就建立了巩固的友好合作关系。苏联和印度、缅甸之间的友好关系，近几年来在争取和平和消除国际紧张局势的共同斗争中，有了很大的发展。特别是今年印度总理尼赫鲁和缅甸联邦总理吴努先后访问了苏联，分别和苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁发表了联合声明，证明苏联和印度、缅甸在许多重大国际问题上的一致看法，这就更加奠定了苏联和印度、缅甸之间友好合作的坚固基础。尼赫鲁总理在莫斯科的群众大会上说：“只要不互相干涉和不强行企图支配对方，具有不同的政治、社会或经济制度的国家之间是没有理由不能这样合作的。”吴努总理在莫斯科的集会表示：“让我代表我的国家宣布，在我们争取殖民地的独立的共同愿望中，在我们争取世界和平的努力中，我们将同苏联团结一致。”苏联和印度、缅甸、阿富汗之间日益增进的友好关系，就是建立在这种尊重民族独立和国家主权、维护和平和促进国际合作的共同愿望的可靠基础上的。
    在苏印和苏缅政府首脑分别发表的联合声明中，都曾肯定和平共处的原则，作为现在和将来发展苏印和苏缅关系的准则。这些原则就是：互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利和和平共处。苏印和苏缅政府首脑的联合声明强调指出，这些原则可以作为各国人民在维护和巩固和平的事业中的共同纲领。只要所有国家都愿意接受并决心遵守这些原则，就可以加强国与国之间的信任和合作，并大大有助于缓和国际紧张局势。苏联和印度、缅甸之间友好关系的迅速发展，就完全证实了这一点。
    在苏联和印度、缅甸、阿富汗之间的友好合作关系中，基于平等互利原则发展彼此之间的经济和文化联系，是一个极其重要的因素。苏联和印度今年二月间签订的苏印协定，就是在这种平等互利原则的基础上建立友好关系的范例。根据这个协定，苏联以利息很低的长期贷款为印度建设一个年产一百万吨钢的炼钢厂，并提供技术援助。苏联和缅甸之间也订立了贸易协定，苏联将向缅甸输出它所迫切需要的工业装备，交换缅甸所急于出售的大米和其他商品。苏联和阿富汗之间的贸易关系，一直是在正常地发展着。苏联已经帮助阿富汗建设了一些有利于国计民生的工厂，并协助它进行城市和交通的建设。苏联同印度、缅甸、阿富汗三国之间扩大经济联系的重要特点是：苏联不仅不附带任何政治条件，在真正的平等互利的基础上进行贸易；而且供应它们成套的工厂设备，提供贷款和原料，派遣头等的技术专家帮助它们进行建设。吴努总理在莫斯科举行的记者招待会上就说：“苏联是第一个同意根据缅甸提出的条件给予缅甸以技术援助的国家。”
    印度、缅甸、阿富汗同苏联之间的经济和文化联系的扩大，无疑有利于它们进行各自国家的经济和文化建设，对它们争取经济独立和改善人民生活所作的努力有重要的影响。
    许多世纪来，亚洲各国人民受到了残酷的殖民主义的压迫和剥削，处于贫穷和落后的状态之中。现在，亚洲许多国家挣脱了殖民主义的镣铐，而走上了独立和复兴的道路。亚洲各国人民在争取自己民族独立和消除殖民主义祸害的斗争中，在建设自己国家和摆脱贫困和落后的斗争中，在维护和平和加强国际合作的斗争中，越来越清楚地认识到苏联人民是亚洲各国人民的忠实的朋友。同苏联人民建立和发展友好合作关系，是完全符合于亚洲各国人民的根本利益的。
    苏联政府领袖对印度、缅甸和阿富汗的友好访问，是加强苏联和亚洲国家间和平合作道路上的重要里程碑，将得到亚洲各国爱好和平人民和全世界进步人类的热烈欢迎。中国人民怀着无限喜悦的感情，欢迎苏联政府领袖的访问亚洲国家，欢迎苏联同印度、缅甸和阿富汗之间的友好合作关系进一步发展，欢迎苏联和印度、缅甸、阿富汗为促进亚洲和世界和平所作的重大努力。
