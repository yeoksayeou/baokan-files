Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 23rd: Bulganin and Khrushchev, along with their entourage, visited the Rudrapur State Farm in the Terai region of Uttar Pradesh on the morning of the 23rd after inspecting the Bhakra-Nangal project. They arrived in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, from Ambala.

Dr. Sampurnanand, Chief Minister of the Uttar Pradesh government, and other officials welcomed the Soviet leaders at the Bareilly airport.

Many colorful arches were erected along the road from the airport to the Rudrapur State Farm. Soviet and Indian flags fluttered in the wind along the road and on the houses. Farmers from nearby villages enthusiastically came to welcome the Soviet leaders. According to Indian traditional rituals, decorated elephants were also lined up along the road to welcome the distinguished guests.

Bulganin planted a sapling at the Rudrapur State Farm as a memento of his visit.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 22nd: On the morning of the 21st, Bulganin and Khrushchev, along with Vice President Radhakrishnan and Prime Minister Nehru, arrived at the Children's Park and participated in a gathering of Indian children in Delhi. Then, accompanied by Prime Minister Nehru, the guests visited a Boy Scout encampment.

The head of the All-India Boy Scouts Association, Kunzru, delivered a welcoming speech to the guests. Following this, Khrushchev spoke at the gathering. He spoke about the excellent friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India. He said that the foundation of this relationship is mainly the common struggle for the noble cause of consolidating world peace.

Khrushchev said: India is a country with a large population, and there is no doubt that its need for food and daily necessities will increase year by year. However, on the other hand, if industry is not developed, the task of improving agriculture cannot be successfully resolved. The key to developing both industry and agriculture is the manufacturing of machinery.

Khrushchev said that the freedom that has been won must be defended. In order to create conditions for the country's complete independence, a solid foundation must be created—a good industry, and reliance on it. He said that in this regard, it is important to first rely on one's own strength, especially because some wealthy countries, when helping others, want to make the country they are helping subservient to themselves.

Khrushchev continued, "We want to strive for permanent friendship. But the people with whom we have established friendship are the older generation. Young people! The future belongs to you. You should continue this established friendly relationship, consolidate it, and pass it on from generation to generation."

The children responded to Khrushchev's speech with continuous, stormy applause. (Photo attached)

　　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫参观印度一国营农场
　　赫鲁晓夫在德里的印度儿童们集会上讲话
    新华社新德里二十三日电　布尔加宁和赫鲁晓夫以及他们的随行人员在参观了巴克拉—南加尔工程以后，二十三日上午从翁巴拉到达北方省的巴累利。他们从巴累利到特拉伊地区参观了鲁德拉普尔国营农场。
    北方省政府首席部长萨姆普尔纳南德博士和其他官员们曾到巴累利的机场上欢迎苏联领袖们。
    从机场到鲁德拉普尔国营农场的道路上扎起了许多彩门。苏联和印度的国旗在路上和房屋上迎风飘扬。附近各村庄的农民都热情地赶来欢迎苏联领袖们。按照印度的传统仪式，路边还排列着一些装饰起来的大象对贵宾们表示欢迎。
    布尔加宁在鲁德拉普尔国营农场栽植了树苗作为访问的纪念。
    据新华社新德里二十二日电　二十一日上午，布尔加宁、赫鲁晓夫同拉德哈克里希南副总统、尼赫鲁总理一起到达儿童公园，参加了德里印度儿童们的一次集会。然后，在尼赫鲁总理的陪同下，客人们参观了一个童子军野营。
    全印童子军组织的负责人孔兹鲁向客人致欢迎词。接着，赫鲁晓夫在会上讲话。他谈到苏印两国之间的最良好的亲善关系。他说，这种关系的基础主要是为争取巩固世界和平这样的卓越崇高事业而进行的共同斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫说：印度是人口众多的国家，没有疑问，它对粮食和日用必需品的需要将逐年增加。然而，在另一方面，如果工业得不到发展，提高农业这项任务也不可能胜利地解决。而发展工业和发展农业的关键是机器制造业。
    赫鲁晓夫说，争得的自由是必须保卫的。为了给国家的完全独立创造条件，必须创造巩固的基础——很好的工业，并且依靠它。他说，在这方面，重要的是首先要依靠自己的力量，尤其是因为某些富裕的国家在帮助别人的时候，就想使它所帮助的国家屈从自己。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，我们要争取永久的友谊。但是我们建立了友谊的人是老一代的人。青年们！未来是属于你们的。你们应当继续这种已经建立起来的友好关系，巩固它，把它一代一代地传下去。
    孩子们用不断的暴风雨般的掌声回答赫鲁晓夫的讲话。（附图片）
