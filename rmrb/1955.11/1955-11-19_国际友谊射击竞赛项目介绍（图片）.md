Introduction to the International Friendship Shooting Competition Events

　　The International Friendship Shooting Competition includes five events, using small-bore rifles, military combat rifles, and small-bore pistols. Each country's shooting delegation participating in each event is required to have a shooting team consisting of five shooting athletes.

　　The five competition events are: (1) Men's free small-bore rifle, distance of 50 meters, shooting in prone, kneeling, and standing positions; (2) Men's military combat rifle, distance of 300 meters, shooting in prone, kneeling, and standing positions; (3) Men's free small-bore pistol silhouette rapid-fire, distance of 25 meters; (4) Women's free small-bore rifle, prone shooting at distances of 50 meters and 100 meters; (5) Women's free small-bore rifle, distance of 50 meters, shooting in prone, kneeling, and standing positions.

　　The competition awards three types of champions: overall champion for all events, team champion, and individual champion. The overall champion for all events is determined based on the scores calculated according to the rankings of the delegation in all five competition events and the results achieved in the men's first event; the highest score wins. The team champions for the first, second, fourth, and fifth events, as well as the team champions for the prone, kneeling, and standing positions in the first event, are determined based on the combined scores of the five shooting athletes. The team champion for the third event is determined based on the total number of targets hit by the four best shooting athletes out of the five; if the total number of targets hit is equal, the total number of rings is used as the tiebreaker. Individual champions are determined separately based on each event and the prone, kneeling, and standing positions in the first, second, and fifth events.
