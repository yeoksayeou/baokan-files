Guizhou Further Develops Cork Production

    Based on the production and purchase of 500 tons of cork last year, Guizhou Province has further completed the production and purchase plan of 700 tons of cork this year. These corks are now being transferred out of the province to supply the needs of other regions.

    Guizhou is one of the provinces with the highest cork production in China, with almost every county in the province producing it. The Ujiang River, Qingshui River, and Panjiang River basins have the highest output. According to a 1954 survey, Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County in the upper reaches of the Ujiang River alone has more than 5,000 cork oak trees of all sizes, of which about one-tenth have reached the harvesting age, producing 100,000 jin of cork annually.

    In order to further develop cork production, Guizhou Province, in addition to planting more than 5,100 mu of cork oak forests last year, plans to plant another 10,000 mu this year. The province has decided to establish a cork processing plant in Bijie, which is currently under construction and will be put into production next year. After the completion of this cork processing plant, it can produce 600 tons of finished products annually. (Zhang Ke)

    贵州进一步发展栓皮生产
    贵州省在去年生产和收购五百吨栓皮的基础上，今年又进一步完成了七百吨栓皮的生产和收购计划。这些栓皮，现在正陆续调运出省，供应外区的需要。
    贵州是我国产栓皮最多的省份之一，全省各县几乎都有出产。其中又以乌江、清水江和盘江流域出产最多。据一九五四年调查，仅乌江上游的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县，就有大小栓皮栎树五千多株，其中达采剥年龄的约占十分之一，每年可产栓皮十万斤。
    为了进一步发展栓皮生产，贵州省除去年营造了五千一百多亩栓皮栎林外，今年计划再营造一万亩。省里决定在毕节建立的一个栓皮加工厂，现正在进行筹建，明年可以投入生产。这个栓皮加工厂建成后，每年可以生产出六百吨成品。（张克）
