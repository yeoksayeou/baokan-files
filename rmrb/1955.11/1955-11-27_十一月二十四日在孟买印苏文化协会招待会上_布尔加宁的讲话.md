　　Bulganin's Speech at a Reception of the Indian-Soviet Cultural Society in Bombay on November 24th

　　Friends! Please allow me to first thank you for the warm welcome you have given us.

　　We could not help but be excited as we approached your border. We could not help but be excited as we entered Indian territory and arrived in your beautiful city of Delhi—your country’s capital.

　　We have come to visit your country, understand your people, and get to know you.

　　Although I have only spent a few days in your country, I must say that we are deeply moved by your sincerity and friendly attitude towards us, the Indian people, their representatives, the Indian authorities, and at this meeting with you today. We feel like we are at home here, as if we are among close friends. (Warm applause)

　　We have come to the Indian-Soviet Cultural Society as guests today. The name of this association itself illustrates the task it undertakes.

　　In recent years, the great Indian people have sent many delegations and individual representatives to our Soviet Union. Many Soviets have also come to India.

　　Those who have visited the Soviet Union include representatives from the Indian scientific community, writers, many social activists, filmmakers, actors, and directors. Many of them are now highly regarded among the Soviet people. We have seen many people we recognize here today. (Applause)

　　We are very happy about this meeting. We especially express our gratitude to the Honorable Chairman of this Indian-Soviet Cultural Society, Dr. Baliga. We also thank the Chief Minister of Bombay State, Mr. Matab, for allowing us to participate in this excellent evening gathering.

　　I propose a toast to the further development of the work of the Indian-Soviet Cultural Society. I toast to the health of the Chairman of this association, Dr. Baliga, and to the health of the Chief Minister of Bombay State, Mr. Matab.

　　Long live Indian-Soviet friendship! (Prolonged applause)

　　十一月二十四日在孟买印苏文化协会招待会上
　  布尔加宁的讲话
    朋友们！请允许我首先感谢你们给予我们的热情的欢迎。
    我们快到你们的国境的时候是不能不激动的。我们在进入印度国土到达你们的美好城市德里——你们国家的首都的时候是不能不激动的。
    我们前来是要访问你们的国家、了解你们的人民和认识你们。
    虽然我在你们的国家才度过几天，但是我应该说，在同印度人民、他们的代表、印度当局以及今天同你们会见时，你们对我们的真诚和友好的态度使我们深深感动。我们在这里好像在家里一样，好像在亲近的朋友当中一样。（热烈的掌声）
    我们今天到印苏文化协会来作客。这个协会的名称本身就说明了它所担负的任务。
    近几年来，伟大的印度人民派了不少的代表团和个别代表到我们苏联。也有很多苏联人来印度。
    访问苏联的有印度科学界代表、作家、很多社会活动家、电影工作者、演员和导演。他们之中有很多人现在在苏联人中间有很大的声誉。我们这一次在这儿看到了很多我们所认识的人。（掌声）
    我们很高兴这次会见。我们特别向领导这个印苏文化协会的可敬的主席巴利加博士表示感谢。我们同样感谢孟买省省长马塔布先生，他使我们能够参加今天这个出色的晚会。
    我建议为印苏文化协会的工作的进一步发展干杯。我为这个协会的主席巴利加博士的健康、为孟买省省长马塔布先生的健康干杯。
    印苏友好万岁！（经久不息的掌声）
