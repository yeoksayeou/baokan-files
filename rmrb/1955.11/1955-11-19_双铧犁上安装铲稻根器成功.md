　　The Huadong Agricultural Science Research Institute, following instructions from the Ministry of Agriculture, recently successfully test-installed a rice root plow on a double-wheel, double-share plow. According to tests, using this rice root plow to dig up rice roots and control rice stem borers can kill up to 96 percent of the stem borers on the spot by the plow blade. Stem borers that are not cut to death will also die due to the very short remaining rice roots, making it impossible for them to survive the winter cold. This double-wheel, double-share plow equipped with a rice root plow only requires one person and one animal to operate, and can plow at least fifteen mu of rice roots per day, which is fifteen times more efficient than in the past. Currently, the Huadong Agricultural Science Research Institute is rushing to produce a batch of rice root plows, preparing to distribute them to Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for key use and experimentation.

　  双铧犁上安装铲稻根器成功
    华东农业科学研究所根据农业部的指示，最近在双轮双铧犁上试装铲稻根器成功。根据试验，使用这种铲稻根器来掘稻根治螟，当场被铲刀切死的螟虫，可达到百分之九十六，留下未被切割死的螟虫，也将因残余的稻根很短，无法度过冬寒而死亡。这种双轮双铧犁附装铲稻根器，只需一人一畜操作，每天至少可以铲切稻根十五亩，可比过去提高工作效率十五倍。目前华东农业科学研究所，正在赶制一批铲稻根器，准备分发江苏、浙江二省作重点使用试验。　（赵伯桃、孔德山）
