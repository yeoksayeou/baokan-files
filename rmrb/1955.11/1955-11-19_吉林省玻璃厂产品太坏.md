Jilin Province Glass Factory's Products Are Too Bad

　　Last year, several products made by the Jilin Province Glass Factory had characteristics. The characteristics of their thermos bottles were: prone to explosion, many breakages, and short insulation time—some only kept warm for two or three hours. The characteristics of their syringes were: leakage of air and water, and inability to secure the needle. The characteristics of their thermometers were: inaccurate sensitivity, small reflective surface, and the degree markings would fall off after use—making it impossible to check the temperature. The style of their hanging ornaments was old and unpopular with the market. Workers sarcastically said: "Nobody wants the hanging ornaments; they are not transparent enough to be used as fish tanks; and they leak when used as flower pots." More than 60,000 were manufactured, but only over 1,000 were sold. In one year, this factory caused a loss of more than 393,000 yuan to the state, and the losses to consumers are incalculable!

　　This year, the quality of the factory's products has not improved much. Most of the thermos bottles do not keep warm. In September, out of more than 101,000 thermos bottles produced, more than 21,000 were reworked, and the breakage rate was 15 percent. Because of the large number of defective products and low quality, another 300,000 yuan has been backlogged and wasted this year.

　　Thermos bottles, thermometers, syringes, hanging ornaments, and the like are not technically complex products. The reason why this factory has been unable to improve product quality for a long time is that some leading staff members often think not of the interests of the state and the broad masses of consumers, but only of themselves and their own unit. As the former factory director, Na Qingxun, said in his self-criticism: "I only considered how to increase output value so that the factory could be changed from a fourth-class factory to a third-class factory. With the rising tide, I, the factory director, would naturally leap from the factory director of a fourth-class factory to the factory director of a third-class factory." Thus, they adopted methods of harming others to benefit themselves and engaging in speculation and trickery in production.

　　The people do not allow a socialist enterprise to adopt capitalist business methods. The leading staff of this factory should immediately correct their mistakes.

### 吉林省玻璃厂产品太坏

　　吉林省玻璃厂产品太坏
    去年，吉林省玻璃厂生产的几种东西都有特点。暖水瓶的特点是：容易爆炸，破损很多，保温时间短——有的只能保暖两三个小时。注射器的特点是：泄气、漏水、安不住针头。温度计的特点是：灵敏度不准、返光面小、刻的度数一用就掉——无法查温度。吊球的式样老，不受市场欢迎，工人讽刺说：“当吊球无人要，当养鱼缸不透亮，当花盆吧，还不漏水。”制造了六万多个，只卖掉一千多个。一年之中这个工厂给国家造成了三十九万三千多元的损失，至于给消费者带去的损失是难以计算的！
    今年，这个厂的产品质量还是没有多少改进，暖水瓶大部分不保温。九月份生产了十万零一千多个暖水瓶，返工品就有二万一千多个，破损的占百分之十五。因为废品多，质量低，今年又积压和浪费了三十万元。
    暖水瓶、温度计、注射器、吊球等并不是技术复杂的产品，这个工厂所以长期不能改进产品质量，是因为某些领导工作人员经常想到的不是国家的利益和广大消费者的利益，而是只想个人和本位。正如前任厂长那庆勋检讨时所说的：“只考虑如何提高产值，好叫厂子由四类厂改为三类厂，水涨船高，我厂长也自然由四类厂的厂长一跃而为三类厂的厂长。”这样，他们就采用损人利己、投机取巧的方法进行生产。
    人民是不允许一个社会主义企业采取资本主义经营方法的。这个工厂的领导工作人员应该立即改正错误。
