Further Improve the Transformation of Capitalist Industry and Commerce

　　Before and After the Public-Private Partnership of All Private Cotton Cloth Dealers in Beijing

　　By Our Reporter Shen Wenying

　　Since the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth last September, private cotton cloth dealers in Beijing have embarked on the path of state capitalism, becoming distributors of the Beijing Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation. Over the past year, the state has carried out a series of socialist transformation efforts on private cotton cloth dealers. Through distribution, mergers, and joint operations, a full industry-wide public-private partnership was implemented on October 1st of this year. This is a great victory for the state's socialist transformation of capitalist commerce.

　　In the early days after liberation, the state did not control many goods, and the free market for cotton cloth still existed. Speculation by cotton cloth merchants in Beijing was rampant, treating "Wufu Cloth" as their "chip" for hoarding and cornering the market. Buxiangzi outside Qianmen and Dahengzhan outside Chongwenmen in Beijing were places for unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculation and profiteering. In June 1949, cloth prices fluctuated more than ten times a day, and state-owned companies had to sell thousands of bolts of cotton cloth every day to stabilize market prices, but cloth prices continued to rise. Many large cotton cloth retail stores resisted state-owned companies by lowering the prices of ordinary goods and raising the prices of high-end goods. Many cotton cloth stores deceived customers by using inferior goods to imitate good goods and by shortchanging dimensions.

　　After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of cotton cloth in September 1954, 142 private cotton cloth dealers in Beijing were approved by the Beijing Administration for Industry and Commerce as distributors of the Beijing Company of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, which improved the business situation of the entire industry. However, the commercial network was not set up reasonably. In addition, the market situation had changed greatly after the planned supply of cotton cloth. Therefore, the business of cotton cloth merchants was unbalanced between districts and between households. For example, six cotton cloth merchants were squeezed into one Buxiangzi outside Qianmen. Before the unified purchase and sale, their main supply targets were farmers selling grain in the Tianqiao grain market, as well as farmers selling fruits in the fruit market not far from Buxiangzi and farmers selling vegetables in the Fengtai area. The commodities supplied were also small native cloth, blue cloth, green cloth, pockets, etc. suitable for farmers' needs. After the unified purchase and sale of grain, supply and marketing cooperatives strengthened the work of purchasing and supplying in rural areas. After the development of the cooperative movement in rural areas, fewer farmers entered the city. Therefore, the business of these cotton cloth stores was very quiet. For example, seven cotton cloth retail stores were squeezed south of Xidan Shopping Center. In the past, when these cloth stores were opened, they mainly catered to the old habit of customers "shopping around to avoid being cheated." Now, cotton cloth has become a planned supply commodity, the prices in the city are unified, and the variety of cotton cloth is basically distributed to each store according to the preferences of consumers in each region. Therefore, such concentration is not needed. However, there is only one cotton cloth store in a large area north and south of Xisi Archway; near Dongsi Archway is a densely populated area, with only four cotton cloth stores with small capital. This not only makes the business of cotton cloth merchants unbalanced, but also cannot meet the needs of consumers. In addition, private cotton cloth stores have decadent and backward management and business practices, and unreasonable expenses are high. Therefore, the business of a large number of stores cannot be maintained. For stores with more capital, good locations, and more varieties, capital turnover is faster and business is better. In response to this situation, the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, in accordance with the principle of "overall consideration and comprehensive arrangement," adopted the method of "calculating accounts household by household and arranging them monthly" to restrict stores with overly good business from purchasing plans and allocating commodity varieties, and adopted the method of distributing hot-selling goods, introducing cloth for government agencies and groups, and lending funds to maintain the operation of loss-making households. The staff of the Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also often mobilized private store employees to urge capitalists to reduce expenses and improve business management. Although there have been some changes, the phenomenon of uneven prosperity and adversity cannot still be resolved.

　　Starting in October of last year, the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, based on this situation, obtained the assistance of relevant departments such as local Party committees, administrative departments, and trade unions. First, Hengxingxiang in Xidan District and Yiji in Buxiangzi outside Qianmen were used as pilot projects for merging stores, adopting the method of "large leading small and prosperous leading struggling," leading private cotton cloth merchants to carry out merging stores, relocating, organizing joint operations, and improving business management. Hengxingxiang is located in the prosperous commercial area of Xidan. Manager Li Zhongjie is a backbone member of the business community, but lacks sufficient capital and is difficult to maintain operations. Yiji Cloth Store is located in Buxiangzi outside Qianmen. Although it has sufficient capital, it is difficult to maintain due to its poor location. The Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company organized Yiji Cloth Store to merge into Hengxingxiang Cloth Store in Xidan, which precisely complemented each other's strengths. After the merger, the business improved and there was a surplus. This example pointed out the direction for joint operations and merging stores in the cotton cloth industry. In the first half of this year, the work of merging stores and joint operations in Xidan District was first piloted at Huachang and Tiancheng. These two cotton cloth stores near the Xidan Shopping Center are located in a concentrated area of cotton cloth stores, but are heavily indebted and have difficulty maintaining business. The Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company mobilized them to merge and relocate to areas with fewer cloth stores near Xisi Archway. During the process of relocating and merging stores, Meng Baichuan, the manager of Huachang Cotton Cloth Store, had concerns. He was afraid that the business would not improve after merging and relocating, and that he would not be able to bear the responsibility. He was afraid that it would be even more difficult to repay the government loan if he lost money. In addition to conducting persuasion and education, the staff of the Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also persuaded Meng Baichuan through Li Zhongjie, the manager of Hengxingxiang, and distributed fast-selling goods and increased commodity varieties. As a result, these two cotton cloth stores not only no longer lost money, but also had monthly surpluses. In April of this year, cotton cloth stores in various districts merged and relocated one after another. During the process of merging stores, stores with good business and surpluses were unwilling to merge with stores with poor business and losses. Individual households even reduced the variety of cotton cloth to reduce turnover. In addition to the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company explaining the benefits of merging stores to private cotton cloth merchants, it also organized capitalists to study and discuss through the Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce, so that capitalists could recognize the benefits of merging stores.

　　After merging stores and relocating, the commercial network was also appropriately adjusted. However, the situation of excessive prosperity or adversity among cotton cloth dealers still cannot be completely changed, resulting in prosperous households being passive in their operations due to controlled turnover, while struggling households simply rely on care and are not actively improving operations, and the enthusiasm of employees cannot be brought into play. At the same time, when carrying out the adjustment of the city's commercial network, it is still difficult to arrange private cotton cloth stores completely according to the needs of the people. In order to better carry out the socialist transformation of private cotton cloth merchants, when the cotton cloth stores in Xidan District carried out district-wide joint operations and applied for public-private partnership, the government approved their application. On September 1st, the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company officially entered into a joint venture with cotton cloth dealers in Xidan District. On October 1st, the urban cotton cloth dealers implemented industry-wide public-private partnership.

　　During the process of industry-wide joint ventures of cotton cloth dealers, the shop assistants were very excited. They demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm in clearing assets and verifying capital. Zhang Danlin, an old worker at Qianxiangyi Cotton Cloth Store in Qianmen District, led his team to prepare before the commodity inventory began. Many employees actively took the lead in carrying out inventory work.

　　After the implementation of public-private partnership, in terms of personnel arrangements, full consultation was conducted with capitalists. All capitalists in actual positions and capitalist agents were assigned appropriate jobs based on the principle of making the best use of their talents, taking into account their specific performance and specific circumstances in accepting transformation. They are generally arranged to serve as deputy directors in various business departments after the joint venture. Most capitalists expressed satisfaction with the asset liquidation and personnel arrangements.

　　In the one month since the joint venture of cotton cloth dealers in Beijing, the state, through public representatives, has strengthened the leadership of business management. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, a series of measures have been taken:

　　In enterprise management, implement democratic management to improve the status of employees in the enterprise. In many districts, the sales plan is proposed by salespersons from the bottom up. After the Municipal Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company studies and proposes plan indicators, the plan is transmitted to various business units. After the salespersons study and discuss, they formulate the work plans for each business group and salesperson, so that the plan meets the masses and the salesperson has a goal to strive for. In order to better complete the tasks assigned by the state, labor competitions have been launched in various districts. The cotton cloth store in Xisi District has also formulated competition indicators such as reducing commodity circulation costs, reducing errors and accidents, and improving work efficiency. The business departments of cotton cloth stores in Chongwen District have formulated work plans and are throwing themselves into a sales drive for slow-moving goods. Some business departments in Qianmen District are trying to reduce the loss rate of cotton cloth. Many business departments have established shortage registration books and customer opinion books. In order to better improve business, a person in charge of business has been drawn from cotton cloth stores in various districts of the city to organize observation groups to visit business departments in various districts, conduct seminars, and exchange business experience. Commodities that are not suitable for the needs of consumers in this district are organized for inter-district adjustment. Due to the increased labor enthusiasm of employees and the change in consumers' views after the public-private partnership, the business volume of public-private partnership cotton cloth in various districts has generally increased.

　　Adjustments and arrangements have also been made for funds and manpower. Qianmen District has more funds and has transferred 20,000 yuan to cotton cloth stores in Xidan District with a shortage of funds and 5,000 yuan to cotton cloth stores in Dongsi District. This has increased the funds in these two districts, increased the variety of cotton cloth, and can meet the needs of the people's lives. In terms of manpower allocation, there are now many cotton cloth stores concentrated in Qianmen District, and there are also many people. It is planned to transfer some of them to state-owned companies and areas with fewer cotton cloth stores such as Dongsi and Xisi, so as to better exert their labor enthusiasm and serve consumer needs.

　　The various districts are now preparing revenue and expenditure budget forms, establishing a unified budget and final account system and property management system, eliminating past blind expenditures and waste. Meeting reporting and rotation systems are being established in various business departments.

　　The Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is further investigating the distribution of residents in various districts, studying the needs of residents and the distribution of the original commercial network, so as to better adjust the supply network, so that it can both meet the needs of the masses and be conducive to the transformation of enterprises.

　　进一步做好改造资本主义工商业的工作
　　北京市私营棉布座商全行业公私合营前后
　　本报记者　沈文英
    去年九月，国家实行棉布统购统销后，北京市私营棉布座商走上了国家资本主义的道路，成为中国花纱布公司北京市公司的经销店。一年多以来，国家对私营棉布座商进行了一系列的社会主义改造工作。通过经销、并店联营，到今年十月一日，已经实行全行业公私合营。这是国家对资本主义商业进行社会主义改造工作的一个很大的胜利。
    解放初期，国家掌握的货源还不多，棉布自由市场仍然存在，北京市棉布商投机活动很猖狂，把五福布当作他们囤积居奇、买空卖空的“筹码”。北京市前门外的布巷子和崇文门外的大恒栈，就是奸商们投机倒把的场所。一九四九年六月间，布价每日涨落十多次，国营公司每天要抛售数千匹棉布来稳定市价，但是布价仍旧不断上涨。许多业务较大的棉布零售店，他们用压低普通商品的价格、提高高贵商品的价格来同国营公司对抗。很多棉布店用次货充好货、克扣尺寸来欺骗顾客。
    一九五四年九月国家对棉布实行统购统销后，北京市一百四十二户私营棉布座商被北京市工商行政机关批准为中国花纱布公司北京市公司的经销店，使整个行业的营业情况有了好转。但是商业网设置得不合理，加上棉布计划供应后市场情况发生了很大变化，因此区和区、户和户之间棉布商的经营不平衡。如在前门外一条布巷子内，就挤着六户棉布商。在统购统销以前，他们主要的供应对象是天桥粮食市场上卖粮的农民，还有离布巷子不远的水果市场上卖水果的和丰台一带进城卖菜的农民，供应的商品也是适合农民需要的小土布、蓝布、青布、口袋等。在粮食统购统销后，供销合作社加强了农村的收购和供应工作，农村开展合作化运动以后，农民进城的也少了，因而这些棉布店的生意很清淡。再如在西单商场以南就挤着七户棉布零售店。过去在开设这些布店的时候，主要是迎合顾客“货跑三家不吃亏”的老习惯。现在，棉布已成为计划供应的商品，全市价格统一了，棉布的花色品种基本上按照各地区消费者的爱好分配给各店了，因此这样的集中是不需要的。但是，在西四牌楼南北很大方圆内只有一户棉布店；东四牌楼附近是个居民稠密的地区，只有四家资金不大的棉布店。这样不但使棉布商的营业不平衡，而且也不能适应消费者的需要。再加上私营棉布店在经营管理和经营作风上的腐朽落后，不合理的开支又多，因而有较大一部分商店的业务不能维持。部分商店资金多、地点好、品种多的，资金就周转得快，营业就好。针对这一情况，北京市花纱布公司根据“统筹兼顾、全面安排”的方针，采取了“逐户算账、月月安排”的办法，对营业过好的商店从进货计划和分配商品品种上加以限制，对亏损户采用分配给热销货、介绍机关团体用布、贷给资金等办法来维持经营。市花纱布公司的工作人员还经常发动私营商店职工督促资本家降低开支、改善经营管理。这样虽然有了一些转变，但仍然不能解决苦乐、肥瘦不匀的现象。
    去年十月开始，北京市花纱布公司根据这一情况，取得了当地党委、行政部门和工会等有关部门的协助，先以西单区恒兴祥和前门布巷子益记两家布店并店为试点，采取“以大带小、以肥带瘦”的办法，领导私营棉布商进行并店、迁移和组织联营、改善经营管理工作。恒兴祥在西单商业繁荣的地区，经理李仲杰是工商界的骨干分子，但是资金不足，经营难以维持。益记布店在前门外布巷子里，虽然资金充足，但是地区不好，也难维持。市花纱布公司组织益记布店并到西单恒兴祥布店去，正好取长补短，并店后营业好转并且有了盈余。这一事例，给棉布业的联营、并店指出了方向。今年上半年，西单区的并店联营工作首先在华昌和天成两家棉布店试点。这两家在西单商场附近棉布店集中的地区，但是负债累累，营业维持有困难。市花纱布公司就动员他们合并后迁移到西四牌楼附近布店较少的地区去。在迁移并店的过程中，华昌棉布店的经理孟百川是有顾虑的，他恐怕并店迁移后营业再不好负不了责任，怕政府贷给他款子亏累了更难办。市花纱布公司的工作人员除了向他进行说服教育外，又通过恒兴祥的经理李仲杰去说服孟百川，并分配给畅销商品，增加了商品品种。这样做的结果，不但使这两家棉布店不再有亏累，而且月月有了盈余。今年四月间，各区棉布店都纷纷并店、迁移。在并店过程中，营业好的有盈余的就不愿意同营业不好有亏累的合并，个别户甚至用减少棉布品种来降低营业额。除了北京市花纱布公司向私营棉布商解释并店的好处外，还通过民主建国会、工商业联合会组织资本家学习讨论，使资本家认识到并店的好处。
    经过并店、迁移，也适当地调整了商业网。但是棉布座商中过肥过瘦的情况仍然不能彻底改变，以至产生肥户因受控制营业额而经营消极，瘦户则单纯依赖照顾，不积极改善经营，职工的积极性也不能发挥。同时，在进行全市商业网调整的时候，要使私营棉布店完全按照人民群众的需要来安排，仍有很多困难。为了更好地对私营棉布商进行社会主义改造，在西单区棉布店进行全区联营，提出申请公私合营的时候，政府就批准他们的申请。九月一日北京市花纱布公司就正式和西单区棉布座商合营。到十月一日，城区棉布座商就实行全行业公私合营。
    在棉布座商全行业合营的过程中，店员都十分兴奋。在清产核资中，他们发挥了高度的积极性。前门区谦祥益棉布店老工人张丹林，在清点商品没有开始的时候，就领着本小组人员作好准备。许多职工都积极带头进行清点工作。
    实行公私合营后，在人事安排上，采取同资本家进行充分协商，对所有的实职资方和资本家代理人，本着量才使用的原则并且照顾到他接受改造的具体表现和具体情况，安排了适当的工作。一般都安排在合营后的各门市部担任正副主任。大多数资本家对清产核资和人事安排都表示满意。
    北京市棉布座商在合营后一个多月以来，国家通过公方代表，加强对经营管理的领导，在市花纱布公司的统一领导下，采取了一系列的措施：
    在企业管理上，贯彻执行民主化管理，提高职工在企业中的地位。许多区的销货计划是自下而上由营业员提出意见，经过市花纱布公司研究后提出计划指标，再把计划传达到各业务单位，经过营业员研究讨论，订出各业务组、营业员的工作计划，使计划同群众见面，使营业员有了奋斗的目标。为了更好地完成国家所交给的任务，各区都展开了劳动竞赛。西四区棉布店还订出了降低商品流转费用、减少差错事故、提高工作效率等竞赛指标。崇文区各棉布店门市部都订出工作计划，正投入推销冷背货热潮。前门区有些门市部正在设法降低棉布的损耗率。很多门市部已经建立了缺货登记薄、顾客意见簿。为了更好地改进业务，在全市各区棉布店中抽调了一个业务上的负责人，组织观摩小组，到各区门市部参观，进行座谈，交流业务经验。对不适合本区消费者需要的商品，就组织在各区间调剂。由于职工们的劳动热情提高，以及公私合营后消费者的看法有了改变，各区公私合营的棉布营业额普遍上升。
    对资金和人力也作了调剂和安排。前门区资金较多，已经调剂给资金短少的西单区棉布店二万元，调剂给东四区棉布店五千元。这样就使这两个区的资金增多，使棉布的花色品种增加，能满足群众生活的需要。在人力配备上，现在前门区棉布店集中，人员也多，准备抽调一部分到国营公司和东四、西四等棉布店较少的地区去，以更好地发挥他们的劳动热情，为消费者需要服务。
    现各区正在编制收支预算表，建立统一的预决算制度和财产管理制度，消除过去盲目开支和浪费现象。会议汇报和轮休制度正在各门市部建立。
    北京市花纱布公司正在进一步调查各区居民的分布情况、研究居民需要和原有商业网分布的情况，以便更好地调整供应网，使它既能适应群众的需要，又能有利于对企业的改造。
