    Relying on the Party's Rural Branches to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well

    "Villages look to villages, households look to households, what the masses look at is the Party branch." This popular saying in the countryside demonstrates the farmers' infinite trust in the Communist Party. This understanding of the peasants comes from their own experience. The Party's branches in the countryside are the grassroots organizations that implement the Party's policies. The Party must use rural branches to understand the situation, to combine the Party's guidelines and policies with reality, to guide the revolutionary actions of the masses; to rely on rural branches to directly mobilize and organize the peasant masses, and to lead Party members to stand at the forefront of the struggle, to lead the masses forward with exemplary actions; and also to rely on rural branches to unify the leadership of any arduous work tasks in the countryside, to uniformly arrange all aspects of work in the countryside, to give full play to the strength of various organizations, and to carry out work in a focused and planned manner.

    In the high tide of the agricultural cooperation movement, the Party's branches in the countryside should play an even stronger role as fighting fortresses.

    The resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee states: "In carrying out the planning work of agricultural cooperation, special attention should be paid to the cooperation planning of townships or villages, because the cooperation planning of townships or villages is the foundation of the entire cooperation planning." How can we do a good job in the overall planning of cooperation? This requires the active participation of rural branches. In order to formulate a cooperation plan for a township or village, it is necessary to specifically analyze the class situation in the township or village in order to accurately implement the Party's class policy and understand who to organize first to form a firm core force for the cooperative movement. It is necessary to investigate the level of awareness, living conditions and personal relationships of farmers at all levels in order to make plans for establishing or expanding cooperatives in batches and phases based on the principle of voluntariness, avoiding coercion and commandism. It is necessary to analyze the current situation of cooperatives and mutual aid teams in order to understand the current problems in cooperatives or mutual aid teams, so as to formulate plans for consolidating cooperatives, expanding cooperatives, combining mutual aid teams, developing mutual aid teams, cultivating activists, and appropriately allocating backbone forces for establishing cooperatives and teams. These overall planning tasks of cooperation are extremely detailed and complex, and at the same time require extensive political and ideological work. These are all the duties of the Party's grassroots organizations in the countryside.

    However, some people still have many worries and dare not let go of relying on the branches to establish and consolidate cooperatives. They believe that "the branch's ability is weak, and there are few methods," and that "the branch does not understand the business of the cooperative and cannot lead it." They believe that a full-time cadre must be sent to establish a cooperative. They are accustomed to the method of taking over and doing everything themselves, which is actually equivalent to abandoning the rural branch and canceling the branch's role as a fortress in the countryside. Their thinking and practice are obviously wrong. In fact, in some areas where the high tide of the cooperative movement has already arrived, such as Shanxi Province, by the summer of 1955, farmers participating in agricultural production cooperatives accounted for 41 percent of the total number of farm households in the province, which was not initiated by a small number of cadres "taking over," but by the active and creative efforts of the Party's more than 13,600 rural branches. Even in areas that were liberated later, as long as the cooperative movement is launched, many branches can quickly learn the work of establishing and consolidating cooperatives. Baise County in Guangxi Province is an example. Most of the 80 township branches in Baise County have learned how to establish cooperatives. Of the 179 cooperatives in the county, 56 were established by the Party's township branches themselves, and they were run very well. Before the autumn of 1954, the Dahe Township Branch in District One had established a cooperative with the help of a cadre sent by the higher authorities; in the spring of 1955, the branch established two more cooperatives on its own. When the district committee transferred the cadre away, it was worried that the Dahe Township Branch would not be able to lead the agricultural cooperative; however, due to the branch's initiative, the collective leadership of the branch committee was strengthened, meetings were frequently held to study the issue of running the cooperative, and when encountering difficulties, not only were the masses consulted, but the district committee was actively consulted, and at the same time, they went to the old cooperative in nearby Fulu Township to learn, and finally made all three cooperatives increase production.

    Some people have also misunderstood and distorted the method of key leadership proposed by the Party. When the village branch has not gained any experience in independently running a cooperative, the leadership should be hands-on and create a prototype to foster the cadres' independent ability and leadership. In addition, model the work and summarize the experience to guide the typical. In the key trial operation, the support of the branch is needed. Help the branch comrades by completing tasks, encourage them with genuine assistance and improving their ability to complete tasks. However, some comrades have turned the leadership method of key trial operation into a method of relying solely on cadres sent from above to take over and do everything themselves. The cadres who were sent neglected the branch, reducing the role of the branch to simply "issuing notices before meetings, moving benches during meetings, and compiling statistical materials in ordinary times." As a result, these cooperatives established by the method of taking over and doing everything themselves appeared to be thriving on the surface when cadres were sent; once the cadres left, the work also went with them. Such "typical examples" and "experiences" are unreliable and one-sided. All cadres sent from above to the countryside must change the erroneous view of not trusting the Party's grassroots organizations, and conscientiously implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions: "Whether it is the work of establishing cooperatives or the work of consolidating cooperatives, local cadres in the countryside should be the main force, and they should be encouraged and charged to do it; cadres sent from above should be the auxiliary force, playing a guiding and helping role there, rather than taking over and doing everything themselves."

    Of course, we should see that the development of Party branches in the vast countryside is extremely uneven. Some provinces still have thousands of villages without branches; even in provinces where rural branches have been generally established, 5 to 20 percent of the branches are still lagging behind in their work. Each county party committee must first analyze the situation of rural branches in the county, classify them, and rely on strong branches to drive general branches, and send cadres to weak or backward branches to help them work, and conduct party consolidation in conjunction with establishing and consolidating cooperatives; for villages without branches, party building work should be carried out at the same time as establishing cooperatives; for villages with few party members, attention should be paid to discovering and cultivating activists in the cooperative movement, developing new party members, and establishing the Party's leadership core in the countryside. The Wu County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Jiangsu Province has adopted this method for half a year, which has improved the better branches, strengthened the general branches, and also enabled the relatively backward branches to begin to change their work. Among the 107 township branches in the county, the better branches have increased from 25 to 61, and the relatively backward branches have decreased from 26 to 17. In the past, the Wangdong Township in Huguan District of Wu County could not work independently due to the district committee's lack of attention to relying on the township branch to run cooperatives. There were only more than 20 mutual aid teams in the township. Although a cooperative was established in 1954, there were many problems and it was not run well. Now, due to the strengthening of leadership by the district committee, the branch in this township has been able to work independently. Eighty percent of the farm households in the township have joined mutual aid teams, and four agricultural cooperatives have been established. The role of the branch has been strengthened, and the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been successfully carried out.

    Whether the rural party branch can play its full role in running cooperatives depends on whether the higher-level party committees, especially the county party committees, provide specific leadership to the branch. It must not be assumed that since rural branches are to be relied upon, the specific leadership of higher-level party committees can be relaxed. The role of rural branches cannot be replaced by higher-level party committees, and the leadership of county and district party committees cannot be replaced by rural branches. Therefore, first of all, county committees should be required to make specific work arrangements. When making work arrangements, it is not only necessary to explain the tasks to the branch, but also to explain the policies and working methods, to explain the favorable conditions for completing the tasks, and to encourage the branch's confidence in the work; at the same time, it is also necessary to explain the possible difficulties and lead them to do arduous and meticulous work. When explaining the Party's guidelines and policies to the branch, they should be explained in great detail and completeness, right-leaning ideas should be criticized, and the branch's enthusiasm and confidence in building cooperatives should be enhanced; at the same time, it should be emphasized that preparations must be made for building cooperatives, that cooperatives must be run well, and that quality must be guaranteed. In addition, it is also necessary to study how to organize the activists among the poor peasants and the lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants to become the core of the cooperative movement, and at the same time, to explain clearly that the middle peasants are the permanent allies of the working class and the poor peasants, and how to consolidate the unity of the middle peasants. The county party committee must also conduct regular inspections of the work, solve the difficulties encountered by the branch, discover good experiences, and quickly promote them, and rely on the key points mastered by the county and district party committees to promote the overall work. In this way, we can help the rural branches continuously improve their work level in the practice of cooperation, further strengthen the unity of the broad masses of peasants, and enable the socialist mass movement to continuously achieve new victories in the countryside.

### 依靠党的农村支部，办好农业生产合作社

    依靠党的农村支部，办好农业生产合作社
    “村看村，户看户，群众看的是党支部。”这句流行在农村里的口头语，表现了农民对共产党的无限信任。农民的这一种认识，是从他们自己的经验里得来的。党在乡村中的支部是执行党的方针政策的基层组织。党要通过农村支部去了解情况，使党的方针和政策同实际结合起来，指导群众的革命行动；要依靠农村支部去直接动员和组织农民群众，并且领导党员站在斗争的最前列，以模范行动带动群众前进；也要依靠农村支部去统一领导农村中任何繁重的工作任务，统一安排农村中各方面的工作，发挥各种组织的力量，有中心地有计划地进行工作。
    在农业合作化运动的高潮里，党在农村的支部更应该发挥坚强的战斗堡垒的作用。
    七届六中全会的决议中写着：“在进行农业合作化的规划工作方面，应该特别注意乡或村的合作化规划，因为乡或村的合作化规划是整个合作化规划的基础。”怎样才能做好合作化的全面规划呢？这就需要农村支部的积极活动了。为了拟定一个乡或村的合作化规划，必须具体分析乡或村中的阶级情况，才能准确地执行党的阶级政策，懂得首先把那些人组织起来，形成一个坚定的合作化运动的核心力量。要调查农民各阶层的觉悟程度，居住条件和人事关系，才能根据自愿原则，作出分批分期建社或扩社的计划，避免强迫命令。要分析现有的合作社和互助组的情况，才能了解当前合作社或互助组中存在的问题，以便拟定整社、扩社、联合互助组、发展互助组的计划，培养积极分子，适当地配备建社建组的骨干力量。这些合作化的全面规划工作，是极其细致和复杂的，并且同时要进行广泛的政治思想工作。这都是党在农村的基层组织应尽的职责。
    但是，还有人有许多忧虑，不敢放手依靠支部建社和整社。他们认为“支部能力弱，办法少”，“支部不懂合作社的业务，领导不了”。他们认为要建一个社必须派一个专职干部。他们习惯于包办代替办法，实际上就等于撇开了农村支部，取消了支部在农村中的堡垒作用。他们的这种想法和做法，显然是错误的。事实上，有些合作化运动的高潮已经到来的地区，像山西省，到一九五五年夏天，参加农业生产合作社的农户已占全省农户总数的百分之四十一，它们不是由少数干部“包办”发动起来的，而是由党的一万三千六百多个乡村支部发挥了积极性和创造性的结果。就是在解放较晚的地区，只要合作化运动开展了，不少支部也能很快学会建社整社的工作。广西省百色县就是一个例子。百色县八十个乡支部，已经大部分学会了建社工作。全县现有的一百七十九个社，其中五十六个是党的乡支部自己办的，并且办得很好。一区大河乡支部，一九五四年秋前，曾在上级派来的一个干部帮助下，建立了一个社；一九五五年春，支部又自建了两个社。区委把干部调走的时候，还曾担心大河乡支部领导不了农业合作社；可是，由于支部发挥了积极性，加强了支委会的集体领导，经常开会研究办社问题，遇到困难，不但同群众商量，还主动向区委请示，同时到附近福禄乡的老社去学习，终于使三个社都增产了。
    还有些人误解和歪曲了党所提出的重点领导的方法。在乡村支部还没有取得独立办社经验的时候，领导机关就应该亲自动手，重点试办，具体示范，培养干部独立工作能力，而且通过试办来创造典型，做出样子，总结经验，指导一般。在重点试办中应该依靠支部，处处帮助支部的同志去进行工作，用切实的帮助去鼓舞他们办社的信心和提高他们办社的能力。但是我们有的同志却把重点试办的领导方法，变成了只是依靠上面派干部包办的方法。派去的干部撇开了支部，把支部的作用降低到只是“开会前下通知，开会的时候搬凳子，平常搞搞统计材料”。结果，这些用包办代替方法所建立的合作社，在派去干部的时候，表面上工作蓬蓬勃勃；派去的干部一走，工作也就跟着走了。这样的“典型”和“经验”是靠不住的、片面的。一切从上面派到乡村中去的干部，必须改变不相信党的基层组织的错误观点，认真执行毛泽东同志的指示：“不论建社工作和整社工作，都应当以乡村中当地的干部为主要力量，鼓励和责成他们去做；以上面派去的干部为辅助力量，在那里起指导和帮助的作用，而不是去包办代替一切。”
    当然，我们应当看到，目前广大农村中党的支部的发展状况是极其不平衡的。有的省还有成千的乡村没有支部；就是已普遍建立了农村支部的省，也还有百分之五到百分之二十的支部工作比较落后。每个县委首先要分析全县农村支部的情况，分类排队，要依靠坚强的支部去带动一般的支部，并有重点地派干部到力量薄弱或者落后的支部去帮助工作，结合建社整社进行整党；对没有支部的乡村，要在建社中同时进行建党工作；对党员少的乡村，要注意在合作化运动中发现和培养积极分子，发展新党员，树立起乡村中党的领导核心。中共江苏省吴县县委，半年以来就采用了这个办法，提高了较好的支部，加强了一般的支部，也使比较落后的支部开始了工作的转变。全县一百零七个乡支部中，较好的支部已从二十五个增加到六十一个，比较落后的支部从二十六个减少到十七个。吴县浒关区望东乡，以前由于区委不重视依靠乡支部办社，支部就不能独立工作，全乡只有二十多个互助组，一九五四年虽然建立了一个合作社，但问题很多，没有办好。现在，由于区委加强了领导，这个乡的支部已经能独立工作，全乡百分之八十的农户参加了互助组，并且建立了四个农业合作社。支部的作用加强了，互助合作运动也就顺利开展了。
    农村党支部能不能在办社中充分发挥作用，决定于上级党委、特别是县委对支部有没有具体领导。绝不能以为既然要依靠农村支部，就可以放松上级党委的具体领导。农村支部的作用是上级党委不能代替的，而县区党委的领导同样是农村支部所不能代替的。因此，首先应该要求县委具体地布置工作。在布置工作的时候，不只是应该向支部交代任务，而且还要交代政策和工作方法，要说明完成任务的顺利条件，鼓舞支部的工作信心；同时也要说明可能碰到的困难，领导他们去做艰苦细致的工作。在向支部交代党的方针和政策的时候，要讲解得十分详尽和完整，要批判右倾思想，提高支部建社的热情和信心，同时，要强调建社必须做好准备工作，办社要办好，要保证质量。此外，还要研究如何把贫农和新老中农中间的下中农的积极分子组织起来，成为合作化运动的核心，同时，又要讲清中农是工人阶级和贫农的永久同盟者，以及怎样才能巩固地团结中农。县委还必须定期检查工作，解决支部碰到的困难问题，发现好的经验，迅速加以推广，依靠县委和区委掌握的重点，推动全面工作。这样才能帮助农村支部在合作化的实践中不断提高自己的工作水平，进一步加强广大农民的团结，使社会主义的群众运动在农村中不断获得新的胜利。
