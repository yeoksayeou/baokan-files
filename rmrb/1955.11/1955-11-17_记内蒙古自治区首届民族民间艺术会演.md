　　Recording the First Ethnic Folk Art Performance of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
　　Zhou Tiemin
    In October, the Cultural Bureau of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region held the first regional folk music, dance, and drama performance and observation conference in Hohhot. This was a grand gathering of the arts of all ethnic groups in the region, showcasing the rich and diverse artistic treasures of the people of Inner Mongolia. More than 800 actor representatives from eight ethnic groups participated in the performance, presenting a total of 282 programs over nearly 20 days. This performance demonstrated that in the new era of being masters of their own affairs, peace, and happiness, and under the guidance of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policies, the artistic endeavors of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have greatly developed, presenting a flourishing new landscape.
    The Mongolian people have always been a musical people, and the Inner Mongolia region is known as the "sea of songs." Over the long years, the working people of Inner Mongolia have created extremely rich and beautiful folk songs and narrative poems. From these folk songs, you can see that the working people used the most beautiful and subtle language to express their love for their hometowns and their lives, to express their ardent love, suffering, opposition to evil, and exposure of darkness. When the singer sings, "Pearl-like cattle and sheep, slowly walking on the green satin-like grassland," the loud singing makes you feel as if you see herdsmen riding horses, herding cattle and sheep, and singing loudly on the green, boundless grassland. If you listen to the "Wuling Flower" sung by Grandma Gailigu, who is 75 years old and has 40 years of singing history, you will painfully feel the deep suffering of the working people in the old society. "Wuling Flower" describes the tragic experience of a young couple in the old society who were not free in love. Gailigu's singing is full of sorrow and indignation, which cannot but move you.
    "Climbing Song," sung by mountain singer Zhang Eryinhu, is a kind of oral poetry widely circulated in the western part of Inner Mongolia. Most of it is created by singers based on their own personal feelings. Zhang Eryinhu, who sang "Climbing Song" this time, is an outstanding folk singer. After liberation, he composed many new lyrics and melodies to sing about the Communist Party and the real life of the people. Based on his years of singing experience, he created a new singing style, and the local people called many of the tunes he composed "Eryinhu Tunes."
    The Mongolian people love peace and freedom. Many folk singers and poets use songs to awaken people's courage for life and struggle, and use songs to praise the heroic figures revered by the broad masses of the people. "Gada Meilin," sung by Bao Suozhu this time, which praises national heroes, and "Singing of Xini Lama," sung by the Ike Zhao League delegation, expressed the working people's precious feelings and high respect for these national heroes. The lyrics of "Gada Meilin" are more than 270 sections long. It is like a long narrative epic, tragic and lingering, full of love for the national hero Gada Meilin and hatred for the warlord Zhang Zuolin. Xini Lama was a person who made great contributions to the revolutionary struggle of the people of Inner Mongolia. He left an indelible impression on the people's hearts, so the people still enthusiastically sing his praises today.
    Songs such as "The Sun That Never Sets Rises on the Grassland," "New Life, New Road," "Village Girl Chorus," "Good Time for Flowing and Sending," and "On the Way Home" sung at the conference expressed the Inner Mongolian people's love for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao and the happy lives of the people from various perspectives. For example, the "Village Girl Chorus" is a lively and novel form. The ten members of the chorus team are rural women from seven townships in three counties in the Hetao Administrative Region. Most of them are production experts and activists in literary and artistic activities. They live in the "sea of songs" and love folk songs. When they sing, their pronunciation is true, their articulation is clear, their expressions are simple, and they are full of strong folk flavor.
    The "Iron Bull" sung by Mao Yihan, a famous artist in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and the "Good Mutual Aid and Cooperation" sung by Pa Jie and others, also left a deep impression on people. These two veteran artists began their artistic lives at the age of fifteen or sixteen and enjoy a high reputation on the grassland. After liberation, they created many excellent Haolaibao and storytelling works. This time, Mao Yihan's "Iron Bull" is his latest masterpiece. He uses figurative and poetic language to describe the Mongolian people's joy at the upcoming opening of the Beijing-Ulan Bator-Moscow railway, singing the unbreakable friendship of the people of the three countries.
    In terms of instrumental performance, we also saw the diversity of folk instruments of various ethnic groups and regions. Many instrumentalists not only let us hear many beautiful tunes, but also showed their pure skills and superb talents. The matouqin played by veteran artist She Laxi won an award for excellent performance at the National Folk Music and Dance Performance in 1953. This time, he played folk songs such as "Zhaomei" and "National Hero Tao Ketu," and the tunes he played were melodious and moving, making you feel refreshed. The "Asier" played by 68-year-old matouqin player Lao Buseng was also touching. His qin sound seems to take you to the boundless grassland. On the grassland, countless knights mounted their horses, passed through sand dunes and willow clumps, and crossed valleys and fields, and various sounds of horseshoes sounded.
    The dances of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have developed rapidly after liberation. More than 60 dance programs were performed at the conference this time. These dance programs all expressed the lives of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia in diverse forms and unique ethnic styles. Jia Zuoguang's "Herding Horse Dance" and "Goose Dance" left a deep impression on people. In "Herding Horse Dance," he shaped the image of a brave and decisive young herdsman: on the vast grassland, a young herder drove the horses to the pasture. He was attracted by the beautiful scenery of the grassland, but suddenly a wild horse ran out of the herd. The herdsman immediately mounted his horse and chased after it. He finally conquered the wild horse, and a smile of victory flashed across his face.
    The dance "Buryat Wedding," directed by Baoyin Batu and others and performed by the Inner Mongolia Song and Dance Troupe, vividly expressed the heroic, bold, and optimistic character and rich inner world of the Inner Mongolian people through the depiction of the customs and habits of the Buryat people on the grassland. It has a strong atmosphere of life and ethnic characteristics. "Milking Dance" and "Chopsticks Dance" are also two successful performances. Both of these dances are full of the joy of labor. They are both like odes to life, telling the beautiful and happy lives of herdsmen.
    The "Hunter Dance" of the Oroqen people vividly expresses the happy mood of the Oroqen people, who live in the deep mountains and dense forests all year round, gathering together to sing and dance and celebrate their victory after a successful hunt. "Taiping Drum Dance" is an art that is loved by the broad masses of people in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia. Through simple and strong steps and crisp and loud drum sounds, it expresses the different emotions and festive harvest of the working people in various labor processes in different seasons.
    In this observation and performance, we also saw the development of Inner Mongolian drama art. For example, Mongolian dramas such as "Moving Forward Again," "Good Start," and "Participating in Mutual Aid Group" were all produced by young Mongolian playwrights. They all more profoundly reflected the real life and new moral concepts of farmers and herdsmen in the Inner Mongolia region, and embodied the victory of the Party's policy of developing mutual aid and cooperation in pastoral areas. The Manchu troupe's octagonal drum "Duilinghua" expressed the broad working women's pursuit of freedom of marriage and happy life through the story of a young couple who passionately love each other. The octagonal drum is a new type of drama performed by the Manchu people. This is a long-buried and about-to-be-lost program. It was rediscovered only after liberation.
    Errentai is an art form loved by the working people in the western part of Inner Mongolia. Its language is refined, its melody is rough and simple, and its form is short and concise. According to incomplete statistics, more than 100 programs have been discovered so far. Some reflect the major events that have occurred in the western part of Inner Mongolia over the years, some expose the various dark forces of the old society, and some praise the working people's pursuit and yearning for a happy life, and praise the pure love between young men and women. The "Walking to the West" and "Visiting the Sick" performed this time have been greatly improved in all aspects.
    This observation and performance conference fully demonstrated that the ethnic folk customs of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have a rich and excellent artistic heritage and the artistic creative power of the people of all ethnic groups. At the same time, this observation and performance will also promote the entire literary and artistic work of the autonomous region, continue to explore and develop ethnic folk art, further carry out mass literary and artistic activities, and encourage the broad masses of the people to actively carry out socialist construction.

　　记内蒙古自治区首届民族民间艺术会演
　　周铁民
    十月间，内蒙古自治区文化局在呼和浩特市举办了全区第一届民族民间音乐、舞蹈、戏剧观摩演出大会。这是全区各族人民艺术的大会师，它向人们展示了内蒙古各族人民丰富多采和悠久的艺术宝藏。参加这次会演的有来自八个民族的八百多个演员代表，在近二十天的演出中，共表演了二百八十二个节目。这次会演表现了内蒙古各族劳动人民在当家作主、和平、幸福的新时代，在共产党和毛主席的文艺方针的指导下，各族人民的艺术事业有了很大的发展，出现了繁荣旺盛的新景象。
    蒙古民族从来就是个音乐的民族，人们称内蒙古地区为“歌海”。内蒙古各族的劳动人民在悠久的年代里创造出了极其丰富、美丽的民歌和诗歌说唱，从这些民歌里你会看出，劳动人民运用了最美丽的最含蓄的语言来表达他们对家乡、对生活的热爱，来表达他们炽烈的爱情、痛苦，反对邪恶，揭露黑暗。当演唱者唱到“珍珠似的牛羊，慢步在绿缎子似的草原上”的时候，那嘹亮的歌声使你仿佛看到在那绿草如茵，一望无际的草原上，牧人骑着马，赶着牛羊，高声歌唱。如果你再听一听年已七十五岁、有四十多年歌唱历史的改利古老大娘所演唱的“乌苓花”，你就会痛楚地感到劳动人民在旧社会的深重的灾难。“乌苓花”是描述旧社会一对青年男女在爱情上不得自由的悲惨遭遇，改利古在演唱中腔调悲愤，使你不得不感动。
    爬山歌手——张二银虎所演唱的“爬山调”，是内蒙西部地区流传极广的一种口头诗歌，绝大部分是歌者根据自己的亲身感受所创编的。这次演唱爬山调的张二银虎是一个杰出的民间歌手，解放后，他编了许多新的歌词和曲调，来歌唱共产党和人民的现实生活。他根据多年的演唱经验，创造一套新的演唱风格，当地的人民把他编的许多曲调称为“二银虎调”。
    蒙古民族是热爱和平和自由的，许多民间歌唱家和诗人，他们用歌声唤起人们对生活和战斗的勇气，用歌声来赞颂那些为广大人民所崇敬的英雄人物。这次会演中包锁柱演唱的歌颂民族英雄的“嘎达梅林”，伊克昭盟代表团演唱的“歌颂锡尼喇嘛”，表现了劳动人民对这些民族英雄的珍贵感情和崇高的敬爱。“嘎达梅林”歌词全长约有二百七十多段，它像一部长篇叙事史诗，悲壮缠绵，歌内充满了对民族英雄嘎达梅林的热爱和对军阀张作霖的切齿痛恨。锡尼喇嘛是一个在内蒙古人民的革命斗争事业上有很大贡献的人，他在人民心里留下了不可磨灭的印象，所以人民在今天还热情地歌颂他。
    会演大会上所演唱的“草原上升起不落的太阳”、“新生活新道路”、“村姑合唱”、“流送的好时光”、“在回家的路上”等歌曲，从各个角度道出了内蒙古人民对共产党毛主席的热爱和人民的幸福生活。如“村姑合唱”是一种活泼、新颖的形式，合唱队的十个人是来自河套行政区三个县七个乡的农村妇女，绝大部分是生产能手和文艺活动积极分子。她们生活在“歌海”里，酷爱民歌；她们演唱的时候吐字真，咬字清，表情纯朴，富有浓厚的民间风味。
    内蒙古自治区的名艺人毛依罕演唱的“铁牤牛”、爬杰等演唱的“互助合作好”等两个好来宝，也给人留下了极深的印象。这两个老艺人都是在十五、六岁便开始了艺术生活，在草原上享有盛名。解放后，他们创作了许多优秀的好来宝和说书。这次，毛依罕的“铁牤牛”，便是他自己最近的杰作，他用形象的富有诗意的语言，描述了蒙古人民对北京——乌兰巴托——莫斯科即将通车的欢乐心情，歌唱着三国人民牢不可破的友谊。
    在器乐演奏方面，也使我们看到了各族各地民间器乐的多种多样。许多琴手不仅使我们听到许多优美的曲调，同时也表现出了他们那种纯熟的技巧和高超的才能。老艺人舍拉西所演奏的马头琴，在一九五三年全国民间音乐舞蹈会演时获得优秀奖，这次他又演奏了“召梅”、“民族英雄陶克图”等民歌，他奏出的曲调悠扬动人，使你心往神怡。六十八岁的马头琴手老布僧演奏的“阿斯尔”也感人心腑的。他的琴声，仿佛把你带到了一望无际的草原，草原上无数的骑士跨上了骏马，穿过了沙丘、柳丛，越过了山谷、田野，响起了各种马蹄声。
    内蒙古各族人民的舞蹈在解放后有了迅速的发展，这次在会上表演的舞蹈节目就有六十多个。这些舞蹈节目都以多样的形式和独特的民族风格表现了内蒙古各族人民的生活。贾作光表演的“牧马舞”和“雁舞”，给人留下了深刻的印象。他在“牧马舞”里塑造了一个勇敢、果断青年牧人的形象：在广阔的草原上，一个年轻放牧者把马群赶到牧场。他被草原美丽的景色吸引住了，然而忽然有一匹烈性的马跑出了马群。牧人马上跨上骏马，追驰而去。他终于征服了烈马，脸上闪耀着胜利的微笑。
    宝音巴图等编导、内蒙古歌舞剧团演出的舞蹈“布利亚特婚礼”，通过对草原上布利亚特人民婚礼的风俗习惯的描写，把内蒙古人民英勇、豪迈的乐观的性格，丰富的内心世界，形象地表达了出来。它有着浓厚的生活气息和民族特点。“挤奶舞”和“筷子舞”，也是两个成功的演出，这两个舞蹈都充满了劳动的欢乐情绪。它们都像一首生活的颂歌，倾诉牧民的美丽的幸福的生活。
    鄂伦春族的“猎人舞”，生动地表现了常年生长在深山密林里的鄂伦春人，在获猎胜利后，男男女女聚集在一起尽情歌舞、共祝胜利的愉快心情。“太平鼓舞”是内蒙古东部地区广大人民所喜闻乐见的艺术。它通过纯朴健壮的步伐及清脆响亮的鼓声，表现了劳动人民在不同季节各种劳动过程中的不同和喜庆丰收的欢乐情绪。
    在这次观摩演出中，我们也看到了内蒙古戏剧艺术的发展。如蒙语话剧“再前进”、“好的开端”、“参加互助组”等都产生在蒙族年轻的剧作者手里。他们都较深刻地反映了内蒙古地区农、牧民的现实生活和新的道德观念，体现了党在牧区发展互助合作政策的胜利。满族剧团演出的八角鼓“对菱花”，通过一对青年男女纵情相爱的故事，表现了广大的劳动妇女对婚姻自由和幸福生活的追求。八角鼓是由满族人民演出的一个新剧种，这是一个埋没已久，即将失传的节目。解放以后，才重新被挖掘出来。
    二人台是内蒙古西部地区劳动人民所喜闻乐见的一种艺术形式，它的语言洗练，曲调粗犷朴实，形式短小精悍。据不完全统计，现在发掘出的节目有一百多个，有的反映了内蒙古西部地区历年来所发生的重大事件，有的暴露了旧社会各种黑暗势力，有的歌颂了劳动人民对幸福生活的追求和向往，歌颂了青年男女之间的纯真爱情。这次演出的“走西口”、“探病”等，在各方面都有很大的改进。
    这次观摩演出大会充分显示了内蒙古自治区民族民间有着丰富的优秀的艺术遗产和各族人民蕴藏着的艺术创造力量。同时，这次观摩演出也将会推动自治区的整个文学艺术工作，继续发掘和发展民族民间艺术，进一步开展群众文艺活动，鼓舞广大人民积极进行社会主义建设。（附图片）
