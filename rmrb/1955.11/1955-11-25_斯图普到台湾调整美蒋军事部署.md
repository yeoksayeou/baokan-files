　  Twining Arrives in Taiwan to Adjust US-Chiang Military Deployment
    Xinhua News Agency, 24th. Pacific US Forces Commander Twining "visited" Taiwan from the 20th to the 24th.

    Twining held successive meetings with the Chiang Kai-shek traitor and high-ranking US-Chiang generals in Taiwan. According to reports, Twining wants to adjust Taiwan's "defense." He will finalize the "coordination system" for mutual relations and cooperation between the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the US armed forces stationed in Taiwan, as well as approve the relationship between the "US Military Assistance Advisory Group to Taiwan" and the entire US military system in the Pacific. In order to make greater use of Taiwan's cannon fodder to serve the United States' policy of occupying Taiwan, the United States will increase the military equipment shipped to Taiwan and implement a more extensive plan to train people to use this new equipment.

    On the 22nd, Twining also went to Kinmen to "inspect front-line defenses." Twining held secret meetings with local Chiang bandit military leaders in Kinmen, listened to reports on the current defense situation of the Chiang bandit troops, and extensively exchanged views on combat deployment.

　  斯图普到台湾调整美蒋军事部署
    新华社二十四日讯　太平洋美军总司令斯图普从二十日到二十四日“访问”了台湾。
    斯图普在台湾同蒋介石卖国贼和美蒋高级将领接连举行多次会谈。据消息说，斯图普要调整台湾的“防御”。他将最后批准蒋介石卖国集团和美国驻台湾的武装部队之间的互相关系和合作的“协调制度”，以及批准“美军协防台湾司令部”和太平洋整个美国军事体系的关系。为了更多地利用台湾的炮灰来为美国侵占台湾的政策服务，美国要增加运给台湾的军事装备，并且要实现一个训练使用这种新装备的人的更加广泛的计划。
    斯图普在二十二日还曾到金门“参观前线防务”。斯图普在金门和当地蒋贼军首脑举行了机密性会议，听取蒋贼军现阶段防务情况的报告，并且就作战部署广泛交换了意见。
