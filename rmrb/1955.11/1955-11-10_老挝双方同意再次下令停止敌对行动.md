Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th: A message from Laos: The Lao Joint Military Commission held a meeting in Vientiane on the 4th.

    At the meeting, the Lao Kingdom and the Lao Fighting Forces discussed a unified resolution to the ceasefire issue in some current areas, especially in Na Kay. Both sides agreed that the general headquarters of both sides' forces would once again order their troops to cease hostilities, with a ceasefire to take effect at zero hours on November 8th. After the ceasefire, the troops of both sides would be stationed in place until the meeting decides on the temporary stationing areas for the Kingdom's troops.

    The meeting then discussed the issue of temporary stationing areas for the Kingdom's troops. The Kingdom side put forward a new proposal to expand their temporary garrison areas. This proposal requires a vast area from Dat Do and Meng Sang near Sam Neua Province to the border of Xieng Khouang Province to be designated as a temporary stationing area for the Kingdom's troops. This area would be about twice as large as the area originally discussed by both sides at the military conference.

    老挝双方同意再次下令停止敌对行动
    新华社河内九日电　老挝消息：老挝联合军事委员会四日在万象举行了会议。
    会上，老挝王国和寮国战斗部队双方讨论了统一解决在目前的一些地方、尤其是在那经的停火问题。双方同意双方部队的总司令部再一次向自己的军队下令停止敌对行动，十一月八日零时起必须停火，停火后双方军队各在原地驻扎，直到会议决定王国军队的暂时驻扎地区为止。
    会议接着讨论了王国军队的暂时驻扎地区问题。王国方面提出了一个要求扩大他们的暂时驻军地区的新建议。这个建议要求把从桑怒省的达多、孟桑附近直至川圹省边境的一块广大地区作为王国军队的暂时驻扎地区，这个地区要比原来军事会议上双方讨论的地区要扩大一倍左右。
