Xinhua News Agency, Prague, November 28th (Dispatch from Yugoslav News Agency, Belgrade): Yugoslav Federal People's Republic President Tito discussed Yugoslavia's current economic problems at the plenary session of the Federal Committee of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia on November 27th.

Tito described the achievements made so far in Yugoslavia's rapid industrialization and emphasized that the time has come to make certain corrections in the programmatic planning of industry and the entire economy in the future, and in eliminating various negative manifestations and abnormal situations—whether subjective or objective. Tito said that today we have reached such a level in the construction of heavy industry, and we already have a certain foundation, that we can continue construction at a slower pace. This is urgently needed in order to relieve the residents of the burden they have borne up to now, to produce as many mass consumer goods as possible as quickly as possible, and to be able to adapt prices to the purchasing power of the residents.

Tito then said that Yugoslavia has paid great attention to the establishment of basic industries, because without these industries, we would not be able to start any large-scale construction. However, the construction of basic industries was not always carried out economically and correctly. The funds used to build large projects were squandered on various non-productive purposes, so billions of dinars were not really used for basic industries, but for various luxurious buildings and other narrow local needs, which slowed down the construction of large projects.

Tito went on to sharply criticize the tendency that has emerged in various places to deny the possibility of establishing smaller, more profitable enterprises locally, and the tendency to desperately build large factories regardless of whether the necessary conditions are available. He also pointed out that in further industrializing Yugoslavia, it is necessary to continue to pay attention to backward areas.

Tito then said that some changes must be made in planning the further development of the Yugoslav economy, and he emphasized that this issue should be treated extremely seriously and all practical possibilities should be properly studied. He recalled that the enlarged meeting of the Executive Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia had discussed the need to revise the current national industrialization plan policy, because that industrialization plan was too large, no longer in line with actual material conditions, and would constitute an increasing burden and threat to the people's living standards.

Tito said that Yugoslavia will not start construction of new large-scale projects this year. The construction of projects that have just started and are not very necessary for the current stage of economic development will be postponed, and the construction of enterprises that require a lot of funds will also be postponed. The capacity of existing enterprises should be fully utilized. At the same time, the possibility of cooperation between various enterprises should also be fully utilized.

Tito pointed out that investment should first be used to meet domestic needs, and first to accelerate domestic development, and then for foreign markets. He believes that the method of advocating balancing the balance of payments solely through the export of industrial products first is wrong. These kinds of industrial products encounter fierce competition in foreign markets, and Yugoslavia must import raw materials at very high prices when manufacturing these industrial products, especially since credit conditions are difficult, and these raw materials must be purchased at prices 25% higher than world market prices. Tito said that therefore, we must mainly establish and develop those industrial sectors that process various raw materials that can be found in Yugoslavia. In the future, we should try to find new possibilities for export goods.

Tito said that the imbalance between industrial and agricultural development should be eliminated, with agriculture accounting for only 26.6% of the national income. He said: The time has come to give priority to agricultural development, because Yugoslav factories are now able to provide machines and artificial fertilizers that used to be imported from abroad. According to the new plan for 1956, agricultural investment should increase by 65% compared to 1954.

Tito then emphasized that the reason why Yugoslavia allowed the dissolution of most agricultural production cooperatives was not because Yugoslavia had abandoned the development of socialist modes of production, but because, as already pointed out, the tradition of private land ownership can only be eliminated by gradually making agricultural producers aware of the superiority of cooperatives. Therefore, cooperatives must become the kind of factor that can stimulate farmers to increase production in the future. In this way, the standard of living in the countryside will be improved, and speculation in prices will become impossible. Cooperatives must help farmers to better organize work and utilize scientific achievements in agriculture. He expressed his belief that through correct policies, the output of certain agricultural products can at least double in five years.

Speaking of the adverse phenomena in foreign trade, Tito pointed out that Yugoslavia now has 536 registered export companies, with little or no management over them. Unscrupulous competition is carried out between export companies, and goods are sold at discounted prices or imported at high prices, which causes losses to the Yugoslav economy.

Finally, Tito said that he only criticized the adverse phenomena in the national economic life in his speech. He said that members of the Socialist Alliance of Working People of Yugoslavia must work harder to eliminate shortcomings in order to achieve greater results. He said that then we will be able to affirm that we will definitely be able to build our economic development on a solid and sound socialist foundation, and ensure the complete victory of our efforts to build socialism.

### 铁托总统谈南斯拉夫目前的经济问题

　　铁托总统谈南斯拉夫目前的经济问题
    新华社布拉格二十八日电　据南斯拉夫通讯社贝尔格莱德讯：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托十一月二十七日在南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟联邦委员会的全体会议上谈到南斯拉夫目前的经济问题。
    铁托叙述了到目前为止在南斯拉夫的迅速工业化方面所取得的成果，并且强调指出，在今后工业和整个经济的纲领计划工作方面以及在消除各种消极的表现和不正常状况——无论是主观的还是客观的——方面实行某些改正的时候已经到来了。铁托说，今天我们在重工业建设方面已经达到了这种水平，我们已经有了一定基础，可以以较慢的速度继续进行建设了。为了使居民解除他们到现在为止所承担的负担，为了尽快生产出尽可能多的大众消费资料，为了能够使价格适应居民的购买力，这样做是迫切需要的。
    铁托接着说，南斯拉夫曾经非常注意建立基本工业，因为，如果没有这些工业，我们将不可能开始进行任何大规模建设。但是，基本工业的建设并不总是经济地和正确地进行。用来建设大工程的资金被乱花在各种非生产的目的上，因此数十亿第纳尔并没有真正用于基本工业，而是用于各种豪华的建筑和其他狭隘的地方需要，这样一来，大工程的建设就放慢了。
    铁托接着尖锐批评在各地出现的否定地方上建立规模较小而赢利较多的企业的可能性的那种倾向，以及不顾是否具备必要条件而拚命要建立大工厂的那种倾向。他还指出，在进一步实行南斯拉夫工业化的时候必需继续注意落后的地区。
    铁托然后说，在计划进一步发展南斯拉夫经济的时候必须作一些改变，他强调指出应当极严肃地处理这个问题，应当恰当地研究一切实际的可能性。他追述说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟执行委员会扩大会议曾经讨论过有必要修改到现在为止的国家工业化的计划政策的问题，因为那个工业化计划太大了，已经不再符合实际的物质条件，而且将构成一种愈来愈大的负担和威胁到人民的生活水平。
    铁托说，南斯拉夫今年将不开始建设新的大规模的工程。刚刚开始而对现阶段的经济发展不是非常必要的工程的建设将延期进行，需要大量资金的企业的建设也将延期进行。对已经建成的企业的能力要加以充分利用。同时，对各个企业间进行协作的可能性也要充分加以利用。
    铁托指出，投资首先是用于满足国内需要，首先是为了加速国内的发展，然后才是为了国外市场。他认为主张仅仅通过首先输出工业品的办法来平衡支付账目的办法是错误的。这类工业品在国外市场遇到很厉害的竞争，而且南斯拉夫制造这种工业品的时候必须以非常高的价格进口原料，特别是由于信贷条件困难，必须以高于世界市场价格百分之二十五的价格来购买这些原料。铁托说，因此，我们必须主要建立和发展那些为可以在南斯拉夫找到的各种原料加工的工业部门。今后应该设法为出口货寻找新的可能性。
    铁托说，工业和农业发展不成比例的状况应该予以消除，农业在国民收入中仅仅占百分之二十六点六。他说：使农业得到优先发展的时候已经到了，因为南斯拉夫的工厂今天已经能够提供以前要从国外进口的机器和人造肥料了。根据一九五六年的新计划，农业投资应该比一九五四年增加百分之六十五。
    铁托接着着重指出，南斯拉夫所以允许大多数农业生产合作社解散，并不是因为南斯拉夫已经放弃了发展社会主义生产方式，而是因为根据已经指出的，土地的私有制传统只有通过逐步使农业生产者认识到合作社的优越性的办法才能消灭。因此，合作社将来必须成为能够刺激农民增加生产的那种因素。这样，乡村的生活水平将会提高，在价格上进行的投机也会成为不可能。合作社必须帮助农民更好地组织工作和在农业中利用科学成就。他表示相信，通过正确的政策，某些农产品产量至少可以在五年内增加一倍。
    铁托在谈到对外贸易的不良现象时指出，南斯拉夫现在有五百三十六家注册的出口企业，对它们的管理很少，或是根本没有管理。出口企业之间进行着没有信义的竞争，货物削价出售或是以高价输入，这使南斯拉夫经济遭到损失。
    最后，铁托说，他在演说中仅仅批评了国家经济生活中的不良现象，他说，南斯拉夫劳动人民社会主义联盟盟员们必须更加努力消灭缺点以取得更大的结果。他说，到那时我们就能够肯定，我们一定能够把我们的经济发展建立在巩固和健全的社会主义基础之上，并且保证我们争取建设社会主义的努力得到完全胜利。（附图片）
