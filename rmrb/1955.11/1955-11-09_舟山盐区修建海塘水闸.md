    Zhoushan Salt District Builds Seawalls and Sluice Gates

    Since the Zhoushan Salt District of Zhejiang Province built a large seawall and three large sluice gates in March of this year, a new atmosphere has emerged.

    The Zhoushan Islands have wide stretches of large beaches, which have been developed into salt fields. However, because the islands protrude into the vast ocean, they are subject to frequent storms throughout the year, and the beaches are often submerged by tides. Not only are the tens of thousands of salt farmers unable to produce salt during the two major spring tides each month, but even during neap tides, they are unable to produce salt because the tide cannot be drawn in. As a result, thousands of acres of large salt fields are abandoned for most of the year. Now that the large seawall has been built, the seawater has been isolated, and more than 7,000 acres of salt fields and more than 3,000 acres of farmland in the pond have benefited from it. At the same time, the seawall can control the seawater and make it available to the salt farmers. During the autumn flood peak production period this year, more than 30,000 dan of salt have been added. The salt farmers said happily: The poor beach has become a rich salt field.

    After the construction of the large seawall changed the face of the Zhoushan Salt District, it greatly promoted the development of the cooperative movement. Many individually producing individual salt farmers are willing to join the salt production cooperatives.

### 舟山盐区修建海塘水闸

    舟山盐区修建海塘水闸
    浙江舟山盐区在今年三月修筑了一条大海塘和三座大水闸以后，出现了新气象。
    舟山群岛有着成片宽广的大海滩，这些海滩已经被开成了盐田。但是因为群岛突出在大海洋里，四季多风暴，海滩常被潮浪所吞没，成千上万的盐民们不但在每月两次大潮汛的时候无法制盐，就是在小潮汛的时候，也因潮水引不上来而无法制盐。所以几千亩的大盐田一年就有大半年荒废。现在，筑起了大海塘以后，海水被隔断了，从此塘闸里七千多亩盐田和三千多亩农田都受了益。同时塘闸能控制住海水，使它为盐民们所利用，今年在秋汛旺产期中，就增加了三万担以上的盐。盐民们高兴地说：穷海滩变成富盐田了。
    修筑大海塘改变了舟山盐区的面貌以后，大大促进了合作化运动的开展。许多独立生产的个体盐民，都愿意参加盐业生产合作社了。
