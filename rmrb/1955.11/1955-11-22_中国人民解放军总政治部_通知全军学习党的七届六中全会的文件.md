　　The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
　　Notice on Studying the Documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party Throughout the Army
    The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice calling on the entire army to conscientiously study the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party.
    The notice first pointed out the important significance of the agricultural cooperation movement. The notice said that the implementation of the policy of agricultural cooperation will inevitably have a huge impact on the broad masses of officers and soldiers in our army. If our work is done well, the thinking of the broad masses of officers and soldiers in our army will be further transformed, and their socialist consciousness will be further enhanced. This is not only necessary for supporting the great cause of agricultural cooperation, overcoming petty-bourgeois economic ideas, and resisting the encroachment of capitalist ideas, but also of extreme importance for consolidating and strengthening the combat effectiveness of our army. Therefore, all personnel in the army must attach importance to this study, and leading organs at all levels must organize this study well.
    The notice pointed out that in studying this document, it is necessary to connect it with reality and with thinking, criticize various erroneous understandings, so that our army personnel, under a unified will, can enthusiastically greet the socialist upsurge in the rural areas of the country and support the agricultural cooperation movement in all aspects.
    The notice requires: all troops should pay attention to regularly publicizing the benefits of agricultural cooperation and the Party's policies on agricultural cooperation to the masses in their garrison areas. During the high tide of the movement, or during the annual rectification of the cooperatives, work teams can also be organized to help promote the agricultural cooperation movement and help with the work of rectifying the Party and the cooperatives under the unified leadership of the local Party committee. It is necessary to mobilize officers and soldiers to write letters to their families, publicizing the benefits of taking the socialist road. During the busy farming season, attention should be paid to helping agricultural production cooperatives with labor and animal power, and usually helping to accumulate fertilizer, help build small-scale water conservancy projects, help repair farm tools, and treat livestock diseases for agricultural production cooperatives. In the event of disasters, the army should actively provide support. Assistance should also be given to poor farmers who are working individually, and they should be informed of the benefits of cooperation and mobilized to join the cooperatives. Attention should also be paid to helping farmers with literacy education and cultural activities. Army farms should regard helping agricultural production cooperatives as their own responsibility. Troops stationed in border areas can also run small army farms when possible, using their exemplary role to promote the improvement of agricultural production technology and the development of the cooperation movement in minority areas.
    The notice pointed out that agricultural cooperation education should be particularly strengthened for soldiers who will be demobilized this winter and next spring, so that these personnel can truly become a force for promoting the cooperation movement after returning to the countryside.
    The notice finally made specific arrangements for this study. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　中国人民解放军总政治部
　　通知全军学习党的七届六中全会的文件
    中国人民解放军总政治部最近发出通知，号召全军认真学习党的七届六中全会（扩大）文件。
    通知首先指出了农业合作化运动的重要意义。通知说，农业合作化政策的实施，在我军广大官兵中必然引起巨大的影响。如果我们的工作做好了，我军广大官兵的思想将得到进一步改造，社会主义觉悟将进一步提高。这不仅对拥护和支持农业合作化这一伟大事业，克服小农经济思想和抵制资本主义思想的侵袭是必需的，而且就巩固和加强我军的战斗力来说，也是极关重要的。因此，全军人员必须重视这一学习，各级领导机关必须很好地组织这一学习。
    通知指出，在学习这一文件时，必须联系实际，联系思想，批判各种错误认识，以便使我军人员在统一意志下热情地迎接全国农村中的社会主义高潮，从各方面来支援农业合作化运动。
    通知要求：各部队要注意经常向驻地群众宣传农业合作化的好处和党的农业合作化的政策。在运动高潮时，或每年整社时，还可组织工作队在地方党委统一领导下帮助推动农业合作化运动，帮助整党整社的工作。要动员官兵向自己的家属写信，宣传走社会主义的路的好处。在农忙时，要注意用劳力、畜力帮助农业生产合作社，平时注意帮助积聚肥料，帮助兴修小型水利，帮助修理农具，替农业生产合作社的牲畜治病等。有灾害时，军队更应积极支援。对单干的穷苦农民也应该加以帮助，并向他们宣传合作化的好处，动员他们入社。军队对于农民的识字教育、文化活动也应当注意帮助。军营农场应当把帮助农业生产合作社当作自己的责任。驻边疆的部队，可能时也可举办小型军营农场，以自己的模范作用，推动少数民族地区的农业生产技术的改进和合作化运动的开展。
    通知指出，对将在今冬明春复员的军人要特别加强农业合作化的教育，使这批人员回到农村后，确实成为推动合作化运动的一支力量。
    通知最后对这一学习作了具体的布置。　（新华社）
