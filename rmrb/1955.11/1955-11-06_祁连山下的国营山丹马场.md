    The State-Run Shandan Horse Ranch at the Foot of the Qilian Mountains
    Zhang Yongsheng
    Near Shandan County in the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province, there is a vast grassland of over a hundred li in area, nestled between the Qilian Mountains and the Yinzhi Mountains. On this grassland, thousands upon thousands of horses graze, herders gallop after the herds, and the barley planted as feed for the horses has ripened. The rattling combine harvesters are busy harvesting. This grassland is the historically renowned state-run Shandan Horse Ranch.
    This horse ranch has a history of over four hundred years, dating back to the Ming Dynasty. Throughout the ages, reactionary rulers seized horses from the common people here as tools for launching wars. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the Ma Bufang bandit gang occupied this ranch, their plunder of the people becoming even more cruel and vicious. On the eve of liberation, they stole over three thousand horses, leaving behind only five thousand old, weak, and decrepit ones.
    After liberation, the state took over the ranch. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the operational policy of the ranch was determined. From then on, the ranch emphasized the improvement and breeding of horse breeds. Starting in 1952, artificial insemination with Don horses (from the Soviet Union) was implemented to improve the breeds. Don horses are tall, can endure hardship and are very hard working. They have great load-bearing capacity, are fast, and have a beautiful appearance, making them well-suited to our country's climate and environment. To ensure the accuracy of the breeding work, the ranch staff brought their collective wisdom into play and studied the estrus cycle of mares, improving the effectiveness of each stallion. Each stallion can now breed with one hundred mares, and its accuracy has reached about 70%. There are now more than four hundred foals bred from Don horses. Added to the foals bred through natural mating of Mongolian and native horses, the total number of horses on the ranch has more than doubled compared to the early days of liberation. Since 1951, the ranch has supplied an average of 1,500 horses to rural areas and the army each year. Starting this year, rural areas and fraternal horse ranches have also signed supply contracts with the Shandan Horse Ranch. The number of horses leaving the ranch this year will reach 2,437.
    The Shandan Horse Ranch has natural conditions for developing horse breeding. Not only is there a large area of grassland here, but there is also a small river flowing straight down from the Qilian Mountains. As the saying goes, "With water and grass, horses and sheep are fat," this is an excellent site for large-scale grazing. On this grassland, a large amount of barley can also be planted every year. In recent years, the state-run Shandan Horse Ranch has reclaimed more than 20,000 mu of wasteland, and this year alone, more than 10,000 mu have been planted, which is currently being harvested. This solves the need for winter feed for some of the horses on the ranch.

    祁连山下的国营山丹马场
    张永生
    在甘肃省河西走廊的山丹县附近，有一片座落在祁连山与姻脂山之间的方圆百余华里的辽阔草原，草原上有成千上万的马匹在啃着青草；放牧的人们飞驰地追赶着马群；播种在草原上的作为马的饲料的青稞已经成熟，轧轧作响的联合收割机正在进行收割，这个草原就是历史悠久的国营山丹马场了。
    这个马场从明朝建立到现在已经有四百多年的历史了。历代反动统治者，在这里抢夺老百姓马匹，作为发动战争的工具。在国民党反动统治的年代里，马步芳匪帮占据了这个马场，对老百姓掠夺更加凶残毒辣，解放前夕，还被他抢走了三千多匹马，只留下五千多匹老弱不堪的马匹。
    解放后，国家接收了这座马场，在党和政府的领导下，确定马场的经营方针。从此，马场重视了马种的改良和繁殖工作，从一九五二年开始以顿河种马（苏联）实行人工授精来改良马的品种。顿河种马，身材高大，能吃苦耐劳，负担力大，速度快，并且外貌美观，很适于我国气候和环境。为了使配种工作准确，马场职工发挥了集体智慧，研究出母马的试情规律，提高了每匹种马的效力，一匹种马可配一百匹，并且它的准确性达到了百分之七十左右。现在顿河种马繁殖的幼驹已有四百多匹了。加上蒙古种马和土种马的自然交配所繁殖的幼驹，全场马匹数目比解放初期增加了一倍多。从一九五一年开始，全场平均每年供应农村和部队的马匹就有一千五百匹。从今年开始，农村和各兄弟马场还与山丹马场订立了供应合同，今年马场出场的数目达到二千四百三十七匹。
    山丹马场有着发展马匹的天然条件。这里，不但有着大面积的草原，而且还有一条从祁连山上直奔下来的小河，俗语说：“有水有草、肥马壮羊”，这是大群放牧的优良场地。在这个草原上，每年还可以种植大量青稞。几年来，国营山丹马场已先后垦荒有二万多亩，今年就播种有一万亩以上，目前正在收割。这就解决了马场一部分马匹的冬季饲料的需要。
