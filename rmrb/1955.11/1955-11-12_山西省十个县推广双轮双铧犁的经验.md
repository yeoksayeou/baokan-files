Shanxi Province's Ten Counties Promote the Experience of Double-Wheel Double-Share Plows
Liu Jie

By the end of August this year, Xinjiang, Luan, and eight other counties in Shanxi Province had promoted a total of 3,433 double-wheel double-share plows, accounting for 76.5% of the annual promotion plan. These counties have used double-wheel double-share plows to cultivate 390,000 mu of land. Due to the late arrival of some plows, they did not catch up with the summer plowing, and the average plow cultivated only over 110 mu of land.

The facts from the ten counties prove that using double-wheel double-share plows results in high efficiency and good quality cultivation. If used appropriately, it can achieve early plowing, universal plowing, and deep plowing that were previously impossible, significantly increasing crop yields. According to land cultivation experiments by the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaxian County, the Advanced Agricultural Cooperative in Changzi County, and the Leixin Agricultural Cooperative, under the same conditions, the land cultivated with the new plow increased wheat production by 17 to 24 jin per mu compared to land cultivated with the old plow. In Yueshe County, the Nankou Village had eight mu of wasteland, known by the masses as the "Golden Sands," which had a very low yield in previous years. After using a double-share plow to till the land, the yield per mu reached 162 jin, an increase of 1.2 times compared to the previous year. Using a double-share plow also reduced heavy physical labor, and the farmers responded very well to the double-share plow.

The ten counties have gained some experience in promoting double-share plows:

1.  The promotion of double-wheel double-share plows should be based on local conditions of land and draught animals, the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation, and the purchasing power of the masses to formulate zoning and classification promotion plans according to local conditions. A plan formulated in this way will be more practical and can prevent backlog and coercion in the work. Shouyang County divided the county into three types of areas based on the above four conditions. The first type is areas with more mountains and less plains, where the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is relatively good, but the economic strength is weak, and the draught animals are mostly small cattle and small donkeys. In this type of area, it was decided to focus on promoting new-style walking plows and appropriately promote double-share plows. The second type of area has half mountains and half plains, good economic conditions, draught animals are mostly large cattle and large donkeys, and the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is also good. In this type of area, it was decided to focus on promoting double-share plows and universally promote new-style walking plows. The third type of area has more plains and less mountains, good economic conditions, draught animals are mostly mules and horses, but the foundation of mutual aid and cooperation is poor. This type of area was determined to focus on promoting double-share plows and appropriately promote new-style walking plows. According to this plan, the county promoted 139 double-share plows and 170 new-style walking plows. At the same time as formulating the plan, universally mobilizing the masses to sign pre-purchase contracts is the best way to make the promotion plan close to actual needs. Among the double-share plows promoted in the ten counties, those with pre-purchase contracts accounted for 40% to 70% of the total.

2.  When promoting double-wheel double-share plows, attention should be paid to dispelling the various ideological concerns of the farmers. They are afraid that the land cultivated with double-share plows will not increase production, that the structure of the plow is complex and they cannot master the technology, that the price is too high and they cannot afford it, that there is no place to repair it when it breaks down, and that it will harm the livestock. These ideological concerns of the farmers must be dispelled. In some places, they calculate the increase in production compared to old plows for the farmers, calculate the increase in cultivation efficiency, and calculate the savings in human and animal labor, which has a very good effect. The Wujiapo Agricultural Cooperative in the semi-mountainous area of ​​Linfen County bought a double-share plow. This year, it can cultivate 300 mu of land, saving 151 human and animal labor days compared to using old plows, which is equivalent to 225 yuan. With this money, you can buy two more double-share plows (before the price reduction). The increase in crop production after deep plowing has not yet been calculated. After this calculation, the cooperative bought two more double-share plows. Under their influence, two nearby townships also bought 24 double-share plows.

3.  While promoting double-wheel double-share plows, technical training should be done well so that double-share plows can truly exert their effectiveness in production. The ten counties have attached great importance to technical training and the training of farmer-tool operators. By the end of August, they had trained 839 cadres who could master the technology and 9,719 farmer-tool operators, an average of 2.8 plowmen per plow. In terms of teaching methods, in addition to running technical training classes in a planned way, the method of "technical assistance delivered to the door" was also adopted, and technicians were sent to the countryside for specific guidance during the plowing season, which was welcomed by the farmers.

4.  While promoting double-wheel double-share plows, help should be given to agricultural cooperatives to solve the problems of draught animal use and labor management. Some members are unwilling to let their livestock pull double-share plows, fearing that the livestock will suffer. The Dazhai Livestock and Agricultural Implement Station in Yueshe County adopted the following methods to solve this problem: (1) Implement a two-shift cultivation system: prepare six heads of livestock, two agricultural implement operators, divide them into a morning shift and an afternoon shift, and the draught animals that cultivate the land in the morning will be replaced with other lighter work in the afternoon, combining light and heavy work. (2) Appropriately increase the remuneration for draught animals pulling double-share plows so that livestock farmers do not suffer losses. (3) According to different draught animals and different land, stipulate the quantity and quality standards for each draught animal's cultivation to prevent the tendency of agricultural implement operators pursuing more cultivation without caring for the draught animals.

In addition, close cooperation between agricultural and supply and marketing departments is an important key to doing a good job in promoting double-wheel double-share plows. The relevant departments in Xinjiang County closely cooperated, divided responsibilities, the Party Committee was responsible for overall leadership and ideological mobilization, the agricultural department was responsible for technical training, the supply and marketing cooperatives were responsible for timely supply, and the handicraft industry cooperatives were responsible for repair and assembly. This approach is very popular among the masses.

　　山西省十个县推广双轮双铧犁的经验
　　刘杰
    山西省新绛、潞安等十个县，到今年八月底共计推广了三千四百三十三部双轮双铧犁，占全年推广计划的百分之七十六点五。这些县已经用双轮双铧犁耕地三十九万亩，由于有一部分犁调到较迟，没有赶上夏耕，平均每部犁只耕地一百一十多亩。
    十个县的事实证明，用双轮双铧犁耕地效率高，质量好。如果运用适当，可以做到过去做不到的早耕、普耕、深耕，使农作物的产量显著增加。根据夏县曙光、长子县先进、雷新等三个农业合作社耕地试验，在同等条件下比旧犁耕的地每亩增产小麦十七斤到二十四斤。榆社大寨村南口有八亩荒地，群众称之为金沙滩，历年产量很低，使用双铧犁翻耕后，每亩产量达到一百六十二斤，比去年增产一点二倍。使用双铧犁，还减轻了笨重的体力劳动，农民对双铧犁的反映很好。
    十个县在推广双铧犁的工作中取得了一些经验：
    一、推广双轮双铧犁要根据当地土地和耕畜的条件、互助合作基础以及群众购买力等情况，因地制宜地订定分区分类推广计划。这样订出来的计划，就比较切合实际，可以防止积压和工作中强迫命令现象的产生。寿阳县根据上述四个条件把全县划分为三种类型区。第一种是山地多、平地少的地区，互助合作基础虽是比较好，但是经济力量薄弱，畜力多为小牛、小驴。在这类地区，确定以推广新式步犁为主，适当地推广双铧犁。第二种地区的情况是山地、平地各半，经济条件好，耕畜多为大牛、大驴，互助合作基础也较好。在这类地区便确定重点推广双铧犁，普遍推广新式步犁。第三种地区是平川地多、山地少，经济条件好，耕畜多为骡马，但是互助合作基础差。这类地区则确定以推广双铧犁为主，适当地推广新式步犁。根据这个计划，全县推广了一百三十九部双铧犁和一百七十部新式步犁。在订计划的同时，普遍发动群众订定预购合同，是使推广计划接近实际需要的最好方式。十个县推广的双铧犁中订了预购合同的就占总数的百分之四十到七十。
    二、推广双轮双铧犁要注意解除农民各种不同的思想顾虑。他们怕使用双铧犁耕的地增不了产，怕犁的构造复杂掌握不了技术，怕价格高买不起，怕坏了没处修，怕拉坏牲口。必须解除农民的这些思想顾虑。有些地方向农民算新旧犁对比增产账，算提高耕作效率账，算节省人、畜工账，效果很好。临汾县半山区武家坡农业合作社买了一部双铧犁，今年可耕地三百亩，比用旧犁要节省人、畜工一百五十一个，折人民币二百二十五元，用这笔钱又可买到两部双铧犁（降价前），深耕以后作物增产的数字还没算在内。算过这笔账以后，社内又买了两部双铧犁。在他们的带动下，附近两个乡也买了二十四部双铧犁。
    三、在推广双轮双铧犁的同时，要做好技术传授工作，使双铧犁真正能在生产中发挥它的效用。十个县都十分重视技术传授和农民农具手的培养工作，到八月底共训练出能掌握技术的干部八百三十九人，农民农具手九千七百一十九人，平均每部犁有二点八个扶犁手。在传授方法上除了有计划地开办技术训练班外，还采用“技术送上门”的办法，在耕地季节派技术员深入农村作具体指导，受到农民欢迎。
    四、在推广双轮双铧犁的同时，要帮助农业合作社解决耕畜使用和劳动管理问题。有些社员不愿让自己牲口拉双铧犁，怕牲口吃苦。榆社县大寨畜力农具站采用以下几个办法来解决这个问题：（一）实行两班耕作制：即准备六头牲口，两个农具手，分成午前一班午后一班，上午耕地的耕畜下午就换其他较轻的活，把轻重活搭配起来。（二）适当增加拉双铧犁的耕畜报酬，使养畜户不吃亏。（三）根据不同耕畜、不同土地，规定每头牲畜的耕作数量和质量标准，防止发生农具手追求多耕，不爱护耕畜的偏向。
    此外，农业、供销等部门密切配合，是作好双轮双铧犁推广工作的重要关键。新绛县几个有关部门密切配合，分工负责，党委负责全面领导和思想发动工作，农业部门负责技术传授，供销合作社负责及时供应，手工业合作社负责修配。这样做法很受群众欢迎。
