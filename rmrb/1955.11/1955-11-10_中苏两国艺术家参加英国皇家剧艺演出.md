The "Daily Worker" said that the Soviet and Chinese artists "caused a sensation."

The "News Chronicle" wrote that the Chinese Art Troupe's "gorgeous costumes, somersaulting like excited fish in a pond, and the sight of six people somersaulting backwards over a six-foot-high wall during the final attack on the castle, were the most amazing spectacles of the evening."

The "Daily Sketch" said that the Chinese Art Troupe's performance "excited the royal family to the point where they almost stood up." When Soviet dancer Tsvetkov performed, "the audience was delighted and roared with laughter."
