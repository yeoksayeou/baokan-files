Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 20th: A mass rally of 500,000 citizens of Delhi was held yesterday afternoon between Old and New Delhi at the Ramlila Grounds to welcome Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev. The rally was presided over by Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

Soviet and Indian Republic flags fluttered everywhere in the square. The ten-foot-high platform’s architecture imitated the style of the famous Buddhist monument in Sarnath, and the gate to the rally venue was built entirely according to the famous Buddhist architecture of Sanchi.

When Bulganin, Khrushchev, and Nehru ascended the platform, thousands of Soviet and Indian flags of all sizes were raised high. The crowd cheered enthusiastically. Colorful kites rose into the sky. Bulganin, Khrushchev, and Nehru waved warmly to the people.

Also on the platform were Chairman of the Delhi Municipal Committee, Agarwal, Chief Minister of Delhi State, Singh, President of the Indian National Congress, Dhebar, as well as Bulganin and Khrushchev's entourage.

After Nehru announced the opening of the meeting, Chairman of the Delhi Municipal Committee, Agarwal, first read out a welcome address on behalf of the citizens of Delhi. The welcome address stated that the visit of the Soviet leaders to India "confirms and strengthens the growing friendship between India and the Soviet Union. We firmly believe that this friendship is not only beneficial to our two countries but will also help advance the cause of world peace and cooperation, which we cherish so dearly." The welcome address stated that the Indian people highly value the many measures taken by the Soviet government to consolidate peace, ease tensions, and eliminate the terror that unfortunately shrouds the world. The welcome address concluded by expressing the hope that the Soviet guests would convey the respect of the citizens of Delhi to the Soviet people and their wishes for the further development and prosperity of the great country of the Soviet people.

Agarwal presented Bulganin and Khrushchev with the full text of the welcome address embroidered in gold thread on silk, as well as ivory carvings carved by famous Delhi artisans.

Next, Nehru invited Bulganin to speak (to be sent separately).

Bulganin's speech was continuously met with warm applause. He concluded by saying "Long live India!" in Hindi! The participants in the rally responded with stormy applause and enthusiastic cheers.

Nehru then spoke (to be sent separately).

By the time the rally ended, it was already dark, and the colored electric lights on the trees around the square sparkled like countless jewels.

As the Soviet guests left Ramlila Grounds, they were once again warmly cheered by the people of Delhi who attended the rally and waited on the streets.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, November 20th: Vice President of the Indian Republic, Radhakrishnan, received Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Bulganin, and Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, yesterday.

Indian Prime Minister Nehru was also present at the meeting.
