Xinjiang to Establish a Large Number of Radio Listening Stations

The People's Committee of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has decided to establish 379 district radio listening stations and 100 agricultural production cooperatives and animal husbandry production cooperatives radio listening stations within the autonomous region next year. The radios and parts for these radio listening stations will be distributed free of charge by the People's Government, along with dry batteries for three months of use.

In recent years, the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region has established radio listening stations in various special districts (autonomous prefectures), counties (autonomous counties), 113 pastoral areas, and remote agricultural areas. After the new stations are completed next year, all 492 agricultural and pastoral areas in Xinjiang will have radio listening stations.
