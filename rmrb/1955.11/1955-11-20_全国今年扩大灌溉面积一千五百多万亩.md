　　The nation expanded its irrigated area by more than 15 million mu this year.
    This year, all parts of the country vigorously constructed small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, expanding the irrigated area by more than 15.58 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 12.9 percent. Calculated at an average increase of 50 jin of grain per mu of cultivated land after irrigation, this can increase the nation’s grain production by 790 million jin.

　　Agricultural producers' cooperatives played a leading and promoting role in the construction of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. Jilin Province expanded its irrigated paddy field area by a total of 269,000 mu this year. Apart from 92,000 mu belonging to state-owned irrigation projects, more than 80 percent of the remaining 177,000 mu of paddy fields were developed by agricultural producers' cooperatives. This spring, under the impetus of 100 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the sixth district of Kunyu County, Shandong Province, many water diversion channels, reservoirs, and wells were built, expanding the irrigated area by more than 3,000 mu, and it is estimated that grain production can be increased by about 400,000 jin. This year, various localities have further implemented the principle of developing farmland water conservancy according to local conditions, achieving the goals of saving labor, saving money, ensuring good quality, and achieving quick results. According to the characteristic that more than 60 percent of Sichuan Province is hilly, Sichuan Province mobilized the masses to build more than 17,000 mountain bay ponds this year, expanding the province's irrigated area by more than 2.9 million mu, more than double the original plan.

　　This year, in order to help farmers build water conservancy projects, in addition to issuing large amounts of loans, the state also newly established many pumping stations and drainage stations. According to incomplete statistics, the country added more than 1,200 pumping machines this year, with a total of more than 27,000 horsepower, benefiting an area of more than 900,000 mu. This year, Guangdong Province established a large-scale Xiataihewei mechanical drainage station in Gaoming County, which permanently relieved the six villages in the fourth district of Gaoming County from the threat of perennial waterlogging, and can increase the nation’s grain production by more than 7 million jin every year.

　　In order to meet the urgent requirements of industrial and agricultural development and the needs of the rapid development of agricultural cooperation, the country plans to expand the irrigated area by 100 million mu during the first five-year plan, increasing grain production by 6 to 10 billion jin per year. In order to complete the state's plan, the Ministry of Water Resources successively convened meetings in various provinces and regions in Beijing, Changsha, Chengdu, Shenyang, and Lanzhou, summarized the work in the first half of the year, and formulated a plan to expand the irrigated area by more than 30 million mu in 1956. At present, winter construction work is being actively carried out in various places, and various projects have been started one after another.

　　全国今年扩大灌溉面积一千五百多万亩
    全国各地今年大力兴修小型农田水利工程，扩大灌溉面积一千五百八十多万亩，超过原计划百分之十二点九。以每亩耕地经灌溉后平均增产五十斤粮食计算，共可为国家增产粮食七亿九千万斤。
    在兴修小型农田水利工程中，各地农业生产合作社起了带头和推动作用。吉林省今年共扩大水田灌溉面积二十六万九千多亩，除有九万二千多亩系国营灌溉工程以外，其余十七万七千多亩水田，百分之八十以上是农业生产合作社开拓的。山东省昆嵛县六区今春在一百个农业生产合作社的带动下，兴修了许多引水渠、蓄水池、水井等水利工程，扩大了三千多亩灌溉面积，估计可增产粮食四十万斤左右。今年各地还进一步贯彻因地制宜兴办农田水利的方针，达到了省工、省钱，质量好、收效快的目的。四川省今年根据本省的百分之六十以上为丘陵地区的特点，发动群众兴修了一万七千多处山湾塘，使全省扩大了灌溉面积二百九十多万亩，比原计划大一倍多。
    今年国家为了帮助农民兴修水利，除发放了大批贷款外，还新建立了许多抽水机站和排水站。据不完全统计，全国今年增加了一千二百多台抽水机，共有二万七千多马力，受益面积达九十多万亩。广东省今年在高明县建立了一个规模较大的下泰和围机械排水站，使高明县第四区六个乡的三万五千多亩农田永远解除了历年内涝的威胁，每年可为国家增产七百多万斤粮食。
    为适应工、农业发展的迫切要求和农业合作化迅速发展的需要，在第一个五年计划内，全国计划扩大灌溉面积一亿亩，每年增产粮食六十至一百亿斤。为了完成国家的计划，水利部曾先后在北京、长沙、成都、沈阳、兰州分别召开了各省区的会议，总结了上半年的工作，拟订了一九五六年扩大灌溉面积三千多万亩的计划。目前，各地冬修工作正在积极开展，各项工程已陆续开工。
