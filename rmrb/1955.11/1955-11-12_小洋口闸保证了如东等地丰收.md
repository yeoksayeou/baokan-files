　　Xiaoyang Estuary Sluice Gate Guarantees Bumper Harvest in Rudong and Other Areas

The newly built Xiaoyang Estuary Sluice Gate at the mouth of the Bicha Canal in Nantong Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, has for the first time protected the bumper harvest of grain and cotton on more than 1.9 million mu of land in Rudong, Hai'an, and Rugao counties. It is estimated that grain production will increase by 13 million jin this year.

The Xiaoyang Estuary Sluice Gate is one of the projects for harnessing the Huai River downstream, and the entire project was completed this year. From February to July, over ten thousand laborers dredged the narrow and shallow lower reaches of the Bicha Canal, and the sluice gate construction workers worked day and night on the beach to build this nine-gate steel and concrete sluice gate. The completion of this sluice gate not only eliminates the threat of waterlogging and drought to the surrounding farmland but also plays a significant role in reducing water and drought disasters in the Lixiahe area.

In June and July of this year, heavy rains fell continuously on both sides of the Bicha Canal, and the farmland was submerged in water half a person deep. At this time, the Xiaoyang Estuary Sluice Gate was completed and opened on July 21, ahead of schedule, guaranteeing this year's bumper harvest of cotton and grain. Changlao Wasteland is one of the famous low-lying areas in Rudong County. Last year, due to the heavy flood, most of the autumn crops were completely lost. This year, although it was flooded four times, each time the water flowed into the Yellow Sea as soon as the sluice gate was opened, and all 10,000 mu of crops reaped a bumper harvest. (Jiang Hai)

　　小洋口闸保证了如东等地丰收
    江苏南通专区栟茶运河入海处新建的小洋口闸，第一次保卫了如东、海安、如皋三县一百九十多万亩土地粮、棉的丰收，预计今年可增产粮食一千三百万斤。
    小洋口闸是淮河下游治淮工程之一，全部工程都是在今年完工的。从二月到七月的五个月时间里，上万民工疏浚了狭浅的栟茶运河下游，建闸工人不分日夜在海滩上建造起这座钢骨水泥的九门水闸。这座闸建成后，不仅免除了周围农田的涝、旱威胁，对减轻里下河地区的水、旱灾害也有重大作用。
    今年六、七月间，栟茶运河两岸连降大雨，农田积水有半人深，正在这时，小洋口闸建成，并提前于七月二十一日开闸放水。保证了今年棉粮丰收。长潦荒田是如东县有名的低洼地区之一，去年大水，秋熟作物大部分颗粒无收，今年虽然也被淹过四次水，但是每次都是只要闸门一开，水就流入黄海，一万亩庄稼全部获得丰收。（江海）
