Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, November 21st:

　　Esteemed Mr. Chairman! Esteemed Members of Parliament!
    First, I want to express my deep gratitude for giving me the opportunity to speak from this esteemed platform, which I consider a great honor. (Prolonged applause)
    When meeting with the citizens of your glorious capital, Delhi, I had the opportunity to express our gratitude to them and your government, and to thank them for the warm and sincere reception we received everywhere. On behalf of the Soviet people, we extend cordial greetings and best wishes to the great people of India. (Applause) I must say that when all of us, your guests, saw hundreds of thousands of friends welcoming us at Ramlila Square, we were deeply moved. The atmosphere of harmony, sincerity, and warmth convincingly showed us that the Indian people are the faithful and selfless friends of the Soviet people. The Soviet people, for their part, will do everything possible to make this friendship grow and strengthen. (Prolonged applause)
    The friendship between our two peoples has a long history. About five hundred years ago, before the first European ships had reached the shores of your country, a Russian traveler, Afanasy Nikitin, visited India and wrote a remarkable work at that time, describing the situation in this wonderful country. He lived in this country for several years and deeply fell in love with it. This was the first "discovery of India" by a Russian.
    The relations established between our two countries have gradually consolidated and developed. Works introducing India began to be published in Russia. At the same time, Russians learned about and recognized your country from your outstanding literary works. The earliest translations of the works of Indian writers (including those of the great Indian poet and playwright Kalidasa) appeared in Russia as early as the eighteenth century. (Applause) Later, translations of Indian epic works gained wide circulation. (Applause)
    After the victory of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the ties and mutual understanding between our two peoples were further strengthened. The principles of equality and self-determination of all nations proclaimed by our revolution received a wide response in other countries, including India, which was then in a colonial dependent state.
    The Soviet people also expressed heartfelt sympathy for the selfless and heroic struggle of your people against colonial oppression and for the restoration of the independence of their motherland. (Applause) It is well known that the thoughts and leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, the outstanding leader of the Indian national movement, played a significant role in this struggle. (Prolonged applause)
    The Soviet people have great interest in India, its history, culture, the life of its people, and the reforms being carried out in your country. This is evidenced by the constantly developing ties between the Soviet Union and India in culture, art, science, and sports. Indian films screened in our country and Indian exhibitions held in various cities of the Soviet Union have been very successful. (Applause)
    Soviet people are also very interested in Indian literature. (Applause) Tagore's brilliant works have been published more than once in our country, and now his complete works are being published. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has published the works of the great Indian poet Tulsidas. (Applause) The works of the excellent writer Premchand and many others have been translated and published. Mr. Nehru's book "The Discovery of India" has been published in Russian, and Soviet readers have learned many new and interesting things about your country from this book.
    The cultural exchanges between our two countries enable the Soviet people to see the diversity of your ancient culture, provide a concept of India's contribution to world civilization, and familiarize us with the modern cultural and scientific wealth of the Indian people. (Applause) There is no need to explain what this means and how it promotes spiritual enrichment.
    The development and strengthening of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India were greatly promoted by the visit of Indian Prime Minister Nehru to our country, who was warmly welcomed by the Soviet people. (Applause)
    Mr. Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union was a major and memorable event for our people. As a result of his visit, it has become even clearer that our two countries have much to learn from each other and can benefit greatly from cooperation. (Prolonged applause)
    Now, the cooperation between India and the Soviet Union is multifaceted, including not only cultural relations but also economic aspects and the struggle to consolidate peace and ease international tensions. I would like to talk about the latter issue in more detail.
    As everyone knows, the era in which we live is an era of great reforms and scientific discoveries, which have paved the way for unprecedented prosperity of human culture and material life. We should all take this into account. At the same time, we cannot fail to take into account the attempts of reactionary forces to turn back the course of history, to use the discoveries of human genius to harm the people, and to use the achievements of science and technology to destroy culture and material wealth and to eliminate millions upon millions of people. This situation prompts the people, parliaments, and governments of all countries to bear a special responsibility for the fate of peace. The Soviet people and the Soviet government fully understand this responsibility and will do everything possible to defend peace and progress. (Applause) We Soviet people are deeply satisfied that, in this regard, there are no differences in the paths of our two peoples and our two governments. (Prolonged applause)
    The Soviet people give a high appraisal of India's contribution to the cause of consolidating peace. (Applause) Thanks to the joint efforts of India, the People's Republic of China, and the Soviet Union, the Korean armistice was achieved, and the flames of war in Indochina were extinguished. India actively advocates granting the People's Republic of China its legitimate status in the United Nations. The Indian government advocates a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue based on consideration of the national interests and legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China.
    India was one of the initiators of the first Asian-African Conference, and it played a prominent role in the conference. The significance of this conference for consolidating universal peace and guaranteeing the rights and national interests of the peace-loving people of the two continents is inestimable.
    The Soviet Union understands and warmly supports the Indian government's attitude on the issue of banning atomic and hydrogen weapons, and on the issue of disarmament in order to use the huge sums of money now spent on expanding armaments for peaceful construction.
    The Soviet people deeply respect the Indian government's efforts to oppose the policy of forming military aggression blocs, to uphold collective peace, and to use negotiations as a tool for resolving international issues. (Applause)
    The relations between the Soviet Union and India, based on the well-known Five Principles, convincingly prove that the principle of peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation between countries with different social and political systems is correct. This important principle is now supported by more and more people, and I hope that most of those who now oppose the peaceful settlement of international issues through negotiations and who are still attempting to pursue a policy of diplomacy based on strength will also accept this principle.
    The foreign policy of the Soviet Union is a policy of peace and friendship among all nations, a policy of actively and consistently striving for peace, opposing war, and opposing any interference by one country in the internal affairs of other countries. (Applause) We follow the teachings of our great teacher Lenin and base our policy on respecting the principles of all nations and on the right of all nations to independently develop their countries according to their own will and interests. (Applause)
    The Soviet Union believes that any aggression is contrary to the conscience and honor of all nations and will lead to the destruction of a large amount of material wealth and the most precious thing in the world – human life. Therefore, we resolutely oppose the use of war as a tool for resolving international disputes and advocate the peaceful settlement of outstanding issues through negotiations. (Prolonged applause)
    The joint efforts made in this regard by the forces of peace, including India and the Soviet Union, have already brought positive results and influenced the outcome of the Geneva summit conference of the four governments. This conference was conducted in a spirit of cooperation, and it played an important role in easing international tensions and restoring trust between the four countries. It paved the way for the foreign ministers of the four countries to specifically discuss issues such as disarmament, European security and Germany, and the development of contacts between East and West.
    At the recent meeting of the four foreign ministers, the Soviet Union, in the spirit of Geneva, was committed to finding mutually agreed resolutions on all these issues.
    As everyone knows, the issue of disarmament is currently attracting particularly close attention from all mankind, because both the increase in conventional armaments and the increase in weapons of mass destruction are causing the people of all countries deep concern about their future.
    The Soviet Union has consistently advocated disarmament and the complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons. (Applause) For many years, the Soviet government has been fighting to achieve this goal, considering the issue of disarmament as the primary task of its foreign policy. We believe that the main point of the issue of disarmament is to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and to stop the expansion of armaments.
    In order to show its sincerity and strive to achieve genuine disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, the Soviet Union agreed to the suggestions made by Western countries at the beginning of this year regarding the limits on the armed forces of the United States, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the United Kingdom, and France, as well as the effective period of the ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons. The Western countries said that they could not agree to the prohibition of nuclear weapons until 75 percent of conventional armaments had been reduced from the agreed disarmament quotas. We also accepted this suggestion.
    In addition, the Soviet government, considering that facts speak louder than words, decided to reduce its armed forces by 640,000 people, and to date, this decision has been largely implemented. This is a very realistic contribution to building mutual trust between countries.
    Our proposals stipulate the establishment of an effective supervision system for the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, including the establishment of monitoring stations in the territories of the respective countries to prevent one country from launching a surprise attack on another. We are very clear that the issue of supervision should be resolved in connection with the main issue of disarmament. Attempting to resolve the issue of supervision of disarmament without implementing disarmament is contrary to common sense and the wishes of the people.
    It is very regrettable that our efforts to break the deadlock on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons have not yet led to positive results.
    In fact, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France are now rejecting what they themselves suggested at the beginning of this year. Now it is necessary to make the conclusion that the Western countries are untrustworthy in the issue of disarmament, they have retreated from their original position, and the new suggestions they have made have set back the issue of disarmament by a whole decade.
    Despite the difficulties, the Soviet government will continue to strive for the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons and to resolve the issue of disarmament. (Prolonged applause)
    Esteemed Members of Parliament, I would also like to express some opinions on the issue of European security. Europe is far away from India, but for hundreds of years, the events that have occurred in this region of Europe have had an impact on the entire world. For example, both World War I and World War II started in Europe.
    Now, the existence of military blocs in Europe, the presence of foreign troops and foreign military bases on the territories of some European countries, causes the justifiable concern of the people of all countries. As Mr. Nehru has repeatedly pointed out, the policy of establishing military blocs does not lead to peace and the easing of international tensions, but rather to the sharpening of international relations, and ultimately to war. As everyone knows, we happen to hold this view as well. (Applause)
    The Soviet government opposes the policy of forming military blocs and advocates the abolition of those blocs that have already been formed.
    We have suggested the establishment of a European collective security system with the participation of all European countries as well as the United States. We made this suggestion last year, and it was opposed by Western countries, who believed that it would undermine the North Atlantic Group, which they claimed was purely defensive. But when we expressed our desire to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western countries rejected us again, thus confirming that their claim that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is defensive is incorrect, and proving that this group is exclusive and aggressive.
    In view of this situation, in view of the signing of the Paris Accords that dragged the Federal Republic of Germany into the North Atlantic Group, the Soviet government and the governments of other Eastern European countries had to take further measures to ensure their own security, and therefore signed the Warsaw Treaty this spring.
    The conclusion of the Warsaw Treaty was a last resort, it was forced by the position taken by the Western countries, therefore, as long as the European security system is established, and the Western countries abandon the North Atlantic Treaty and the Paris Accords, we are ready to abandon the Warsaw Treaty.
    The policy of establishing and expanding military blocs, as well as the policy of establishing and maintaining military bases on foreign territories, does not promote international trust, but rather is an obstacle to the path of peaceful development of all nations.
    The Soviet Union, taking this into account, has abandoned its base in Port Arthur on Chinese territory and its base on the Porkkala Peninsula on Finnish territory, and now it does not have any military bases on foreign territories. (Applause) If some other countries that have military bases in foreign countries were to follow the example of the Soviet Union, it would be a great contribution to further easing international tensions and supporting the "Geneva spirit" with concrete actions. (Applause)
    Regrettably, it must be pointed out here that some people are unwilling to follow the "Geneva spirit" in their actual activities. For example, attempts to expand and strengthen the notorious Southeast Asia "Defense" Treaty Organization (most of the participants in this treaty are non-Asian countries) and to form military blocs in the Middle East, near the borders of India and the Soviet Union, prove this point. In this situation, the Soviet government believes that it is its duty to be particularly vigilant against the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and international cooperation.
    There is no doubt that the German issue is one of the most important issues: whether Germany will develop along the path of establishing a peaceful and democratic country that does not participate in military blocs, or will embark on the path of reviving militarism and joining the military blocs of Western countries. The interests of European and world peace require a unified Germany to embark on the first path – the path of peaceful and democratic development. The Soviet Union determines its position on the German issue based on this interest.
    We also proceed from this reality: that there are now two Germanys that have formed in the last ten years – the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, which have different social structures. We believe that resolving the German issue is primarily the matter of the German people themselves, and that the task of the major powers is to assist them in unifying Germany on the path of peaceful and democratic development. (Applause)
    The Soviet Union has proposed the establishment of an All-German Committee, an institution that can coordinate the efforts of the two existing German states in the political, economic, cultural life of the German people and in cooperation with other countries to consolidate peace. All this will help create the conditions to resolve the German issue and restore the unity of Germany through free elections based on German national interests and European security interests.
    In the past six months, the Soviet government has taken many new and significant steps that have helped create an atmosphere of trust and consolidate peace in Europe. The Soviet Union has restored and successfully developed friendly relations with Yugoslavia. The Austrian State Treaty has been concluded with Austria, which has embarked on the path of permanent neutrality. An agreement on the establishment of diplomatic relations has been reached between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany. The Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have concluded a treaty on relations that consolidates the sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic. These actions of the Soviet government speak for themselves and need no further explanation. (Applause)
    Our era is characterized by profound changes in the political situation in Asia and the entire East. The great historical process of the awakening and participation in political life of the people of Eastern countries is taking place. This process is proceeding vigorously, and no force can stop it. Of course, there are also those who attempt not to see or ignore the great historical changes that are now taking place in the East. However, these changes exist, are having a tremendous impact on the entire international life, and will inevitably have a tremendous impact on the entire international life in the future.
    The current international situation in Asia is characterized by the existence of several issues that require significant efforts to be resolved. For example, the issue of realizing a political settlement in Indochina in accordance with the resolutions of the 1954 Geneva Conference has caused unease. The Soviet Union will tirelessly strive to implement these resolutions. (Applause)
    Members of Parliament, it is clear from this that there are many things in common in the foreign policies of our two countries. We are jointly committed to an ultimate goal: easing international tensions, maintaining and consolidating peace, preventing war, freeing humanity from the horrors of war, and ensuring that people can work with peace of mind and live a happy and peaceful life.
    What could be more noble than this? I think everyone agrees that in order to achieve this noble goal, we should work hard, and as our proverb says, roll up our sleeves and work tirelessly. (Prolonged applause)
    We also have a lot in common in resolving the tasks put forward by our two countries' respective domestic lives.
    When the people of our country completed the October Revolution, they set themselves the task of realizing economic and cultural reforms in their homeland, turning it into an industrialized socialist country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people successfully solved this historical task.
    You are going your own way. You are also faced with the task of turning your homeland, which has been forever freed from colonial rule, into an advanced country with a developed national economy and a relatively high standard of living. The Soviet people fully understand and wholeheartedly sympathize with your efforts to complete these tasks. (Applause)
    We believe that there are currently all possibilities to further expand Soviet and Indian cooperation in the economic and cultural fields, as well as in scientific and technological research. We are prepared to introduce our economic and scientific and technological experience to you. (Applause) This is in line with the wishes of our people. All the necessary prerequisites for further developing trade between our two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit are also in place. (Long applause)
    Everything we have seen in the first few days after arriving in India has confirmed our firm belief that the further development of our two countries' relations is based on the solid foundation of common and multifaceted interests. (Applause)
    For the benefit of the people of India and the Soviet Union, for the sake of maintaining and strengthening world peace, may the friendship and cooperation between our two peace-loving countries be consolidated and developed! (Stormy and prolonged applause)

### 十一月二十一日在印度共和国国会　布尔加宁的演说

专栏：

　　十一月二十一日在印度共和国国会
　　布尔加宁的演说敬爱的主席先生！敬爱的议员先生们！
    首先我要深深感谢给我机会在这个崇高的讲坛上讲话，我认为这对我是极大的荣幸。（经久不息的掌声）
    在同贵国的光荣首都德里的市民们会面的时候，我有机会向他们和向你们的政府表达我们的谢忱，对我们到处受到的热烈和恳切的招待表示感谢。我们代表苏联人民向伟大的印度人民转达亲切的问候和祝福。（掌声）我得说一句，当我们大家，你们的客人，在拉姆利拉广场上见到几十万朋友欢迎我们的情景的时候，我们十分感动。当时的气氛的融和、恳切和热烈十分令人信服地向我们说明：印度人民是苏联人民的忠实和无私的朋友。苏联人在自己这方面，也将尽一切努力，以便使这种友谊成长和壮大。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们两国人民的友谊有着久远的渊源。大约在五百年前，当第一批欧洲船只还没有到达你们国家的海岸的时候，俄国的一位旅行家阿法纳西·尼基京就访问了印度，并且写了一部当时很出色的作品，记述这个美妙的国家的情况。他在这个国家住了好几年，并且深深地爱上了它。这就是由俄国人实现的第一次“印度的发现”。
    我们两国之间建立的关系逐渐地巩固和发展。介绍印度的作品开始在俄国出版了。俄国人同时从你们卓越的文学作品中了解了和认识了你们国家。印度作家的作品（包括印度伟大的诗人和戏剧家迦梨陀娑的作品在内）的最早的译本远在十八世纪就在俄国出现了。（掌声）随后印度史诗作品的译本获得了广泛的流传。（掌声）
    在伟大的十月社会主义革命在俄国胜利以后，我们两国人民之间的联系和互相了解更为加强了。我们的革命所宣布的各国人民平等和自决的原则在其他国家（其中包括当时处在殖民地附属国地位的印度）得到了广泛的反应。
    苏联人民并且对你们的人民为反对殖民压迫和为恢复祖国独立而进行的奋不顾身的英勇的斗争表示衷心的同情。（掌声）大家知道，印度民族运动的卓越领袖圣雄甘地的思想和领导在这个斗争中起了重大的作用。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联人民对印度，对它的历史、文化、人民的生活和你们国家正在进行着的改革，有很大的兴趣。这一点从苏联和印度之间在文化、艺术、科学和体育方面不断发展着的联系中得到了证明。在我国放映的印度电影和在苏联各城市举办的印度展览会，都得到了很大的成功。（掌声）
    苏联人对印度的文学也有很大兴趣。（掌声）泰戈尔的天才的著作不止一次地在我国出版，现在正在出他的全集。苏联科学院出版了印度伟大的诗人图尔西·达斯的作品。（掌声）优秀作家普雷姆·昌德和其他许多人的著作都已经翻译出来，并且出版了。尼赫鲁先生所著的“印度的发现”一书已经用俄文出版，苏联读者从这本书里知道了很多有关你们国家的新的和有趣的事情。
    我们两国之间所进行的文化交流使苏联人能看到你们的各种各样的古代文化，提供了关于印度对世界文明的贡献的概念，使我们熟悉印度人民的现代文化和科学财富。（掌声）没有必要再来解释这有什么样的意义以及这一切如何促进精神上的丰富。
    苏联和印度两国之间友好关系的发展和加强在极大程度上是由印度总理尼赫鲁的访问我国所促成的，他曾经受到苏联人的热烈欢迎。（掌声）
    尼赫鲁先生访问苏联对我国人民来说是重大的和值得纪念的事件。由于他访问的结果，已经显得更加清楚，我们两国有许多东西可以互相学习，并且可以从合作中得到不少的益处。（经久不息的掌声）
    现在，印度和苏联两国的合作是多方面的，除文化关系外，还包括经济方面以及为争取巩固和平和缓和国际紧张局势而斗争的问题。关于后面一个问题我想比较详细地谈一谈。
    大家知道，我们所生活的时代是伟大的改革和科学发现的时代，这种改革和发现为人类的文化和物质的空前繁荣铺平了道路。我们大家都应该考虑到这一点。同时，也不能不考虑到反动势力的这种企图：它要使历史的进程倒退，利用人类天才的发现来危害人民，把科学和技术的成就用来破坏文化和物质财富，消灭千千万万的人们。这种情况促使各国人民、议会和政府对和平的命运负担起特别的责任。苏联人民和苏联政府完全懂得这种责任，并且将竭尽全力来保卫和平和进步。（掌声）我们苏联人感到深深满意的是：在这方面，我们两国的人民和我们两国的政府的道路没有分歧。（经久不息的掌声）
    苏联人民对于印度对巩固和平事业的贡献给予崇高的估价。（鼓掌）由于印度、中华人民共和国和苏联的共同努力，朝鲜停战实现了、印度支那的战火被扑灭了。印度积极主张给予中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。印度政府主张在考虑中华人民共和国的国家利益和合法权利的基础上和平解决台湾问题。
    印度是第一次亚非会议的发起国之一，它对这次会议的进行起了卓越的作用。这次会议对巩固普遍和平、保证两大洲爱好和平的各国人民的权利和民族利益的意义是难以估计的。
    苏联了解并且热烈赞同印度政府在禁止原子武器和氢武器问题上，以及在裁减军备以便把现在在扩充军备方面所耗费的巨额资金用来进行和平建设问题上所采取的态度。
    苏联人民深为敬重印度政府为反对拼凑军事侵略集团的政策、为维护集体和平和作为解决国际问题的工具的谈判方法而作的努力。（鼓掌）
    以著名的五项原则为基础的苏印两国的关系，令人信服地证明了具有不同社会制度和政治制度的国家可以和平共处和友好合作这个原理是正确的。这一重要的原理现在受到越来越多的人的拥护，我希望，在那些现在反对通过谈判和平解决国际问题的人以及还在企图实行实力地位的外交政策的人当中，大多数人也将要接受这个原理。
    苏联的外交政策是和平和各国人民友好的政策，是积极地和一贯地争取和平、反对战争和反对一个国家对其他国家的内政进行任何干涉的政策。
  （掌声）我们遵循我们的伟大导师列宁的遗训，把自己的政策建立在尊重各国人民的原则上，建立在各国人民有权利根据他们自己的意志和利益独立地发展国家的基础上。（掌声）
    苏联认为，任何侵略都是违背各国人民的良心和荣誉的，都会导致大量的物质财富和世界上最宝贵的东西——人的生命的毁灭。因此我们坚决反对以战争作为解决国际争执问题的工具，并且主张通过谈判和平解决悬而未决的问题。（经久不息的掌声）
    包括印度和苏联在内的和平力量在这方面所作的共同努力已经带来了积极的成果，并且影响到日内瓦四国政府首脑会议的结果。这个会议是本着合作的精神进行的，它在缓和国际紧张局势和恢复四国之间的信任方面起了重要的作用。它为四国外长具体地讨论裁军、欧洲安全和德国、发展东西方之间的接触这样一些问题铺平了道路。
    在不久以前结束的四国外长会议上，苏联本着
  “日内瓦精神”，致力于在所有这些问题上找到一致同意的决议。
    大家知道，裁军问题目前引起了全人类特别密切的注意，因为不论是常规军备的增加，不论是大规模毁灭性武器的增加都引起各国人民对自己未来的深深的忧虑。
    苏联一贯主张裁军和完全禁止原子武器和氢武器。（掌声）许多年以来，苏联政府一直为实现这个目标而斗争，认为裁军问题是自己外交政策的首要任务。我们认为裁军问题的主要之点是禁止原子武器和氢武器，停止扩充军备。
    苏联为了表示诚意和力求达到真正的裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器的目的，同意了西方国家在今年年初提出的关于美国、苏联、中华人民共和国、英国和法国的武装部队限额问题以及关于完全禁止原子武器和氢武器的禁令生效时期的问题的建议。西方国家说，在从一致同意的裁军定额中裁减掉百分之七十五的常规军备之前，它们不能同意禁止核子武器。这个建议我们也接受了。
    此外，苏联政府考虑到事实胜于雄辩，决定裁减自己的武装部队六十四万人，并且到现在为止，基本上已经实现了这个决定。这对于建立国与国之间的相互信任是十分现实的贡献。
    我们的建议规定对裁减军备和禁止原子武器和氢武器建立有效的监督制度，其中包括在相应国家的领土上设立监督站以防止一国对另一国发动突然袭击。我们十分清楚，监督问题应当同关于裁军的主要问题联系起来解决。企图不实行裁军而解决对裁军的监督问题是违反常识和人民的愿望的。
    十分遗憾的是，我们为打开关于裁军和禁止原子武器和氢武器问题上的僵局所作的努力，现在还没有导致积极的结果。
    实际上，美国、英国和法国现在拒绝了它们自己在今年年初所建议的东西。现在不得不下这样的论断：西方国家在裁军问题上是言而无信，它们离开自己原先的立场后退了，它们所提出的新建议使裁军问题整整倒退了十年。
    虽然有困难，苏联政府今后还将争取禁止原子武器和氢武器，争取解决裁军问题。（经久不息的掌声）
    敬爱的议员先生们，我还想就欧洲安全问题谈一些意见。欧洲离印度很远，但是，几百年来欧洲这个地区所发生的事件都是对全世界有影响的。例如，第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战都是从欧洲开始的。
    现在欧洲存在着军事集团，在欧洲一些国家的领土上还驻有外国军队和建有外国军事基地，这种情况引起了各国人民的理所当然的担心。正像尼赫鲁先生所一再指出的，建立军事集团的政策不会导致和平和国际紧张局势的缓和，而是导致国际关系的尖锐化，最后导致战争。大家知道，我们恰好也是抱着这种看法。（掌声）
    苏联政府反对拼凑军事集团的政策，主张取消那些已经形成的集团。
    我们曾建议建立有欧洲各国以及美国参加的欧洲集体安全体系。我们在去年就提出了这个建议，而这个建议遭到西方国家的反对，它们认为这个建议会破坏以所谓纯粹防御为目的的北大西洋集团。而当我们表示希望参加北大西洋公约组织时，西方国家又拒绝了我们，这样就证实了他们硬说北大西洋公约组织是防御性的这种说法是不正确的，并且证明了这个集团是排他的和侵略性的。
    鉴于这种情况，鉴于把德意志联邦共和国拖入北大西洋集团的巴黎协定的签订，苏联政府和其他东欧国家政府不得不采取保障自己安全的进一步措施，因此于今年春季签订了华沙条约。
    缔结华沙条约是迫不得已的事，它是迫于西方国家所采取的立场而产生的，因此，只要欧洲安全体系一经建立，西方国家抛开北大西洋条约和巴黎协定，我们就准备放弃华沙条约。
    建立和扩大军事集团的政策以及在外国领土上建立和保持军事基地的政策，不会促成国际信任，而是各国人民和平发展道路上的障碍。
    苏联考虑到这一点，因而放弃了自己在中国领土旅顺港的基地和在芬兰领土波卡拉半岛的基地，现在它在外国领土上没有任何军事基地。（掌声）如果在外国有军事基地的其他某些国家也照苏联的榜样去做，那将会是对进一步缓和国际紧张局势的一大贡献，是用具体行动来支持“日内瓦精神”。
  （掌声）
    遗憾的是，这里不得不指出，某些人不愿意在自己的实际活动中遵循“日内瓦精神”。例如，企图扩大和加强臭名昭彰的东南亚“防御”条约组织
  （参加这一条约的基本上是一些非亚洲国家）以及在中近东、靠着印度和苏联国境的地方拼凑军事集团这一切做法，就证明了这一点。在这种情况下，苏联政府认为，对和平和国际合作的敌人的阴谋活动特别保持警惕是自己的本分。
    毫无疑问，德国问题是最重要的问题之一：德国将沿着建立一个和平民主的、不参加军事集团的国家的道路发展，还是将走上复活军国主义和加入西方国家的军事集团的道路。欧洲和世界和平的利益要求统一的德国走上头一条道路——和平民主发展的道路。苏联就是从这种利益出发，确定它在德国问题上的立场。
    我们还从这个现实情况出发：现在存在着最近十年中形成的两个德国——具有不同社会结构的德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国。我们认为，解决德国问题首先是德国人民自己的事情，而大国的任务在于协助他们在和平和民主的发展的道路上统一德国。（鼓掌）
    苏联建议建立一个全德委员会，这个机构可以协调现在所存在的两个德意志国家在德国人民政治、经济和文化生活方面以及在同其他国家为了巩固和平而实行合作方面的种种努力。所有这一切将有助于创造条件来解决德国问题和根据德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益通过自由选举来恢复德国的统一。
    在过去六个月当中，苏联政府曾经采取了有助于创造信任和巩固欧洲和平的气氛的许多新的重大步骤。苏联恢复了，并成功地发展了同南斯拉夫的友好关系。同踏上了永久中立的道路的奥地利缔结了奥地利国家条约。苏联和德意志联邦共和国之间达成了建立外交关系的协议。苏联和德意志民主共和国缔结了巩固德意志民主共和国主权的关系条约。苏联政府这些行动本身就可以说明问题，不须再作解释了。（掌声）
    我们时代的特点是亚洲和整个东方国家中的政治局势的深刻变化。东方各国人民觉醒和参加政治生活的伟大历史过程正在发生。这个过程正在热火朝天地前进，没有任何力量可以使它停止。固然，也有人企图不看到，或是无视现在在东方所发生的伟大的历史性变动。但是，这些变动是存在的，正在对整个国际生活发生巨大的影响，并且将来不可避免地还要对整个国际生活发生巨大的影响。
    亚洲当前的国际局势的特点是：存在着需要作重大的努力才能获得解决的若干问题。譬如，根据
  一九五四年日内瓦会议决议实现在印度支那的政治解决的问题引起了不安。苏联将始终不倦地力求实现这些决议。（掌声）
    议员先生们，由此可见，在我们两国的外交政策上是有许多共同之处的。我们共同致力于一个终极目标：缓和国际紧张局势，维持和巩固和平，防止战争，使人类免除战争恐怖，保证人民安心地劳动和愉快地和平生活。
    有什么事情会比这件事更崇高呢？我想大家都同意：为了达到这个崇高的目的，应该努力，应该像我们的俗话所讲的那样，卷起袖子，不吝惜自己的力量地去干。（经久不息的掌声）
    我们在解决我们两国各自的国内生活所提出来的任务上，也有很多的共同点。
    当我国人民完成了十月革命以后，他们就给自己提出了任务，要在自己的祖国实现经济改革和文化改革，把它变成一个工业化的社会主义国家。苏联人民在共产党的领导下顺利地解决了这个历史任务。
    你们走着自己的道路。你们也面临着这样的任务，就是把自己的永远摆脱了殖民统治的祖国变成一个有着发达的民族经济和生活水平相当高的先进国家。苏联人民充分理解和衷心同情你们为完成这些任务所作的努力。（掌声）
    我们认为目前有着一切可能来进一步扩大苏联和印度在经济和文化方面以及在科学和技术研究方面的合作。我们准备把我们的经济和科学技术的经验介绍给你们。（鼓掌）这是符合我国人民的愿望的。在平等和互利的基础上进一步发展我们两国之间贸易的一切必要的前提也已经具备了。（长时间的鼓掌）
    我们到印度来后头几天所看到的一切证实了我们坚强的信念：我们两国关系的进一步发展是奠定在共同的和多方面的利益的巩固基础之上的。（鼓掌）
    为了印度和苏联两国人民的利益，为了维护和加强世界和平，愿我们两个爱好和平的国家的友谊和合作得到巩固和发展！（暴风雨般的经久不息的掌声）（新华社据塔斯社德里二十一日电）
