The cooperative movement in the coastal fishing and salt-producing areas of Fujian has seen significant development.

According to statistics from early October, 473 new fishery production cooperatives have been established, nearly one and a half times more than before the movement. Many old cooperatives have also expanded their organization. The new and old cooperatives together account for more than 30% of the province's fishing households, exceeding the original plan set by the Provincial Party Committee. It is expected that by the spring fishing season next year, half of the province's fishing households will have joined the cooperatives.

Near the four major salt fields of Putian, Shanyao, Lianxun, and Dongshan in Fujian Province, 77 salt industry production cooperatives have been established. Together with the 48 expanded old cooperatives, 4,396 salt farmer households have joined, accounting for more than 73% of the total salt farmer households. This exceeds this year's development plan.

Starting in September, the Party committees at all levels in the fishing and salt areas publicized Chairman Mao's instructions to the fishermen and salt farmers, made cooperative plans, sent out work teams, and trained a large number of backbone personnel for running the cooperatives. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of fishermen and salt farmers, especially the fishermen and poor fishermen and salt farmers, for setting up cooperatives was unprecedentedly high. According to statistics from 65 newly built fishery cooperatives, fishermen and poor fishermen accounted for more than 64%. At present, the new and old fishery cooperatives are closely integrating with winter fishing production and are formulating production plans for this winter and next year. The newly established salt industry cooperatives have begun unified management, and many cooperatives have implemented a combination of agriculture and salt industry. Encouraged by the cooperative upsurge, the Lianxun and Dongshan salt fields have completed this year's production plan ahead of schedule.

　　福建渔区和盐区合作化运动迅速发展
    福建沿海渔区、盐区合作化运动已有很大发展。
    据十月上旬统计，新建渔业生产合作社已有四百七十三个，比运动前的增加近一倍半。许多老社也扩大了组织。新老社共计已占全省渔户的百分之三十多。超过了省委原订计划。预计到明年春汛前，全省将有半数渔户入社。
    福建省莆田、山腰、莲浔、东山四大盐场附近已办了七十七个盐业生产合作社，连同扩大了的四十八个老社，已经有四千三百九十六户盐民入社，占盐民总户数的百分之七十三以上。超过今年发展计划。
    从九月份开始，渔、盐区各级党委向渔、盐民宣传了毛主席的指示，作出了合作化规划，派出工作队，并训练了大批办社骨干。广大渔、盐民特别是渔工和贫苦渔、盐民办社热情空前高涨。据六十五个新建渔业社统计，渔工和贫苦渔民占百分之六十四以上。目前，新老渔业社正密切结合冬汛生产，纷纷制定今冬和明年生产规划。新建的盐业社已开始统一经营，许多社已实行农、盐业结合。莲浔、东山两盐场在合作化高潮鼓舞下，已经提前完成今年生产计划。
