　　Qaidam Basin Completes General Survey This Year
　　The No. 632 Team of the Northwest Geological Bureau's various field detachments have completed this year's geological survey of the Qaidam Basin ahead of schedule and exceeded their targets. In this year's survey work, they discovered many oil-bearing structures, as well as iron, coal and other mineral deposits. Due to the development of a comprehensive conservation campaign, reduced expenditures, and increased work efficiency, the country saved more than 1.4 million yuan in investment. Geological personnel overcame various difficulties in their work. The fifth detachment of this team worked for a long time in mountainous areas above 5,000 meters above sea level, not only experiencing difficulty breathing but also constantly fighting against ice and snow, but they happily completed 39% more route reconnaissance tasks than originally planned. Currently, the various field teams are studying and summarizing this year's survey work and formulating work plans for next year.
　　Xinhua News Agency reported: An oil-bearing structure in the Qaidam Basin encountered oil during shallow drilling. Drilling personnel have continuously obtained more than 100 meters of oil-bearing sandstone from the core retrieval筒. According to preliminary analysis and identification at the construction site, the oil content of this sandstone is very good. Now, this shallow well is about to be completed, and test oil extraction and other work to determine whether this structure has exploitable value will be carried out soon.

　　柴达木盆地今年普查工作完成
    西北地质局六三二队各野外分队提前超额完成了今年度柴达木盆地的地质普查工作任务。他们在今年的普查工作中，发现了很多储油构造以及铁、煤等矿藏。由于开展全面节约运动，紧缩开支，提高工作效率，给国家节约投资一百四十多万元。地质人员在工作中克服了各种困难。这个队的第五分队长期工作在拔海五千公尺以上的山岳地区，不但呼吸感觉困难，并且经常要和冰雪作斗争，但是他们却愉快地超过原计划百分之三十九完成了路线概查任务。现在，各野外队正在研究总结今年的普查工作和制定明年的工作计划。
    柴达木盆地的一个储油构造在浅钻过程中钻到了石油。钻井人员从岩心采取筒里接连获取的含油砂岩已有一百多公尺长。根据工地上的初步分析鉴定，这种砂岩的含油情况很好。现在，这口浅井就要钻成，为确定这个构造是否具有开采价值的试油、试采等工作也将很快进行。（据新华社讯）
