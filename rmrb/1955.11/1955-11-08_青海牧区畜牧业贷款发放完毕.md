    Livestock Loans in Qinghai Pastoral Areas Fully Distributed

    Livestock loans in seven counties in Qinghai Province's pastoral areas, including Gangca and Nangqian, have been fully distributed. According to incomplete statistics, the state has distributed more than 230,000 yuan in livestock loans in these areas, helping 1,113 poor herding families purchase more than 13,800 head of cattle and sheep, establishing a preliminary production foundation for them.

    Party and government leading organs in these areas have attached great importance to the distribution of livestock loans this year.

    In the process of distribution, the principles of "general consideration, key distribution" and "focusing on means of production, supplemented by means of subsistence" were adhered to; and multi-livestock households were mobilized to sell livestock, so that poor herders could immediately buy breeding livestock after receiving loans. 127 poor herding families in Gangca County purchased 3,094 ewes after receiving loans, averaging 24 ewes per household.

    青海牧区畜牧业贷款发放完毕
    青海省牧业区刚察、囊谦等七个县畜牧业贷款已经发放完毕。据不完全统计：国家在这些地区共发放畜牧业贷款二十三万多元，帮助一千一百一十三户贫苦牧民购买了牛、羊一万三千八百多头，使他们建立了初步生产基础。
    这些地区的党、政领导机关对今年发放畜牧业贷款工作都很重视。
    在发放过程中，坚持了“一般照顾，重点发放”“以生产资料为主，生活资料为辅”的原则；并动员多畜户出卖了牲畜，使贫苦牧民得到贷款以后，立即买到了母畜。刚察县一百二十七户贫苦牧民，得到贷款后买到了母羊三千零九十四只，平均每户可得母羊二十四只。
