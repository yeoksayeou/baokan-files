Commemorating the Sixtieth Anniversary of the Discovery of X-Rays
Yu Yiti, Deputy Chairman of the Radiological Society of the All-China Medical Association

To see through the internal structure of objects, including people's own bodies, has been mankind's wish and fantasy for thousands of years. This fantasy was finally realized sixty years ago—on November 8, 1895. This is the discovery of X-rays.

At that time, the entire physics community around the world was focusing on the study of cathode rays. Röntgen (1845-1923), who served as a physics professor at various universities in Germany, was no exception. Before 1895, Gassiot, Crookes, Lenard and others had conducted many experiments on "discharge phenomena through low pressure."

People often discover the mysteries of nature from ordinary things. For example, Newton saw an apple falling and understood gravity, and Watt saw a kettle lid being pushed open by steam and invented the steam engine. But these inventions and discoveries are not accidental. One must have keen observation and scientific foresight to grasp these natural phenomena. Gassiot, in his discharge experiment in a vacuum tube, inadvertently produced X-rays. He attempted to photograph them with a photographic glass plate, but he did not expect that this invisible ray could penetrate the packaging of the photographic glass plate and expose the plate. During the experiment, he placed the photographic glass plate close to the vacuum tube without any isolation, so that the photographic glass plate was already exposed before the photography. Repeated experiments failed, and he had to stop. In the spring of 1894, Röntgen started from scratch again with the study of "discharge phenomena through low pressure." The instruments he used were a Lenard vacuum tube with an aluminum window and a cardboard fluorescent screen coated with barium platinocyanide crystals. He did not anticipate or plan to discover X-rays, but merely attempted to prove whether Hertz's experiment was correct: that cathode rays could penetrate thin metal sheets. However, the light emitted by the vacuum tube during the experiment hindered the work. He thought that since cathode rays could penetrate wood and metal, then wrapping the vacuum tube in black paper would certainly still allow them to pass through. Sure enough, it was confirmed that a certain invisible ray passed through the wrapped black paper and caused the barium platinocyanide fluorescent screen to fluoresce. He then placed his hand between the vacuum tube and the fluorescent screen and discovered that a black shadow of his hand bones appeared on the fluorescent screen. Because the fluorescence occurred, he inferred that there must also be a photochemical effect, so he tried to photograph Mrs. Röntgen's hand. This is the first X-ray photograph in history. Because the physical properties of this invisible ray had not yet been observed, it had to be represented by the unknown number in algebra, called X-ray.

X-ray photography was originally just one of the research methods, but now it has become the purpose of research. After the discovery of X-rays, newspapers in various countries competed to spread the news around the world under the titles of "Translucent Photography of Opaque Objects," "Radiation that Penetrates All Things," and "Special Diagnostic Method for Fractures and Bone Diseases." Research institutes around the world with vacuum tube equipment competed to experiment with X-ray photography. Within a week of the publication of research papers, hundreds of photographs had been taken worldwide. On January 6, 1896, Röntgen announced his discovery of X-rays. The next day, someone had already used this new radiation to remove a needle embedded in a woman's palm. This is the only example of the fastest application of the results of physics research to medicine. Half a year after the discovery of X-rays, the first radiological society was established, and a magazine called "Clinical Photographs" was published.

As a scientist, Röntgen is worthy of our learning for his thoroughness and humility in research. Although he received the highest honor in the scientific community, won numerous medals, and the first Nobel Prize in Physics, he humbly did not hold a commemorative lecture. He declined the honorary position of President of the Berlin National Physical Society, declined the title of nobility of the German Empire, and continued to study day and night. The paper of December 28, 1895, clarified that the new radiation could cause barium platinocyanide paper to fluoresce in a dark room, whether on the surface or the back of the paper, and even at a distance of two meters. He experimented with various substances, including paper, wood, rubber, various liquids, various metals, and various minerals, proving that the density of the substance was not the determining factor in the X-ray penetration rate. He further proved that the newly discovered radiation and the properties of cathode rays were completely different: it did not refract on the spectroscope, it was absorbed in the air, and it did not deviate in the magnetic field. The second research paper of March 9, 1896, added the physical effects of X-rays: it has an ionization effect, and when it passes through gas, the gas becomes a conductor. All substances that collide with cathode rays can generate X-rays, but to varying degrees. The axis of the anode to the cathode needs to be tilted at less than forty-five degrees, which gave great inspiration to the manufacture of X-ray tubes. The third research report published in May 1897 further included many new discoveries: air significantly scatters X-rays. The X-rays emitted from the vacuum tube are a mixed radiation, and its properties vary with the voltage. Scientists like Röntgen, who are not satisfied and do not stop at the achievements they have made, but continue to discover new problems and solve them accurately and thoroughly, are worthy of our learning.

What is even more commendable is Röntgen's humanitarian spirit of saving lives and helping the wounded. At that time, it was the mature period of capitalism before the First World War. Inventions and discoveries were regarded as commodities, patent rights were contested, and exaggerated publicity or concealment of new inventions and discoveries were carried out in advertisements. However, although Röntgen possessed a new discovery that sensationalized the world, he advocated that all instruments and drugs that were beneficial to mankind and had therapeutic effects on patients should be made public unconditionally and should not be privately owned. When Siemens, the largest electrical plant in Germany, proposed to buy his patent rights, Röntgen flatly replied: "I do not ask for a patent. X-rays were not discovered by me. X-rays are the common property of all those who use X-rays. I believe that there is still much room for research in X-rays. I never want to monopolize my research results. For those who are interested in research, I am willing to provide all my writings and equipment."

In capitalist society, tools that are beneficial to mankind are often used for evil purposes: the function of X-rays has been distorted to: they can be used to peek into the contents of safes and the secret documents of diplomats; a row of vacuum tubes can be used to observe the enemy's positions. A student at Columbia University in New York even told the press that X-rays could be used to turn a dime and three cents' worth of metal into one hundred and fifty-three gold yuan in three hours. Reed, a member of the Toronto State Assembly in the United States, was so ignorant that he mistakenly believed that X-rays could see naked bodies, and therefore thought it was immoral. He proposed a bill: in the future, the use of X-ray opera glasses will be prohibited. As for the dispute over who the discoverer of X-rays was and the rumors that slandered Röntgen, they have been circulating for a long time. But Röntgen's achievements cannot be submerged. Although X-rays are not omnipotent in medicine, the breadth of their application and the accuracy of diagnosis are unprecedented among other scientific research results. It can not only detect fractures and bone diseases, but also observe pathological changes in internal organs. It not only indicates changes in the morphology of organs, but also reveals abnormalities in the motor function of internal organs. The objects of pathological anatomy and biopsy are organs and tissues that are disconnected from the human body, while the objects of X-ray examination are living organs and tissues of living bodies. This is the superiority of X-rays compared to pathological examination. X-ray diagnostics has occupied a very important position in medical scientific research and clinical application. The early X-ray machines emitted less radiation and had weak penetration. The film used thirty years ago was a glass plate, which was slow to sensitize and had coarse particles. It took more than half an hour to take a picture, which often burned the skin and caused medical accidents. There is a monument in St. Georg Hospital in Hamburg, Germany, to the 160 victims of X-ray and radium treatment. Now there are machines with up to 150,000 volts and 1,000 milliamperes, and photographic film has been replaced with fast-sensitive and fine-grained film or rolls, which shortens the exposure time and improves the penetration and clarity of the photos. In recent years, electronics has further advanced fluoroscopy. The brightness of the image can be magnified 300 to 3,000 times, and fluoroscopy can be performed in bright places without the need for a darkroom. Internal organs that could only be observed under fluoroscopy in the past—such as the pulsation of the heart and blood vessels—can now be accurately recorded by wave meter photography. And the peristalsis of the gastrointestinal tract can be continuously photographed at the fastest speed, so that doctors can have a comprehensive understanding of the function of the gastrointestinal tract. Due to the creation of various contrast imaging methods, it is now possible to observe not only hollow organs such as the stomach, intestines and bronchi, but also the kidneys, gallbladder, and even the blood vessels of the liver and the blood vessels of the brain, the location, scope and nature of brain tumors. X-ray diagnostics has become an important branch of medicine, and its scope will continue to expand and become more complex. In terms of preventive medicine, rapid and inexpensive fluoroscopic miniature radiography (also known as indirect photography) is no longer new. However, it has not yet been popularized in capitalist countries. Only in the socialist Soviet Union is it possible to apply it not only to collective chest examinations to search for early tuberculosis, but also to further apply it to collective examinations of the gastrointestinal bones to detect cancer early.

Cancer, which is second only to tuberculosis in prevalence but far exceeds tuberculosis in harm, can only be surgically treated in a few cases. For this evil disease that harms mankind, radium and X-ray deep therapy are the most effective medical tools. The progress of atomic energy research has produced more than 800 radioactive isotopes. Radium will tend to be replaced by inexpensive radioactive isotopes. But in the near future, X-rays will still be a treatment method for cancer that is parallel to surgery and radium. The progress of X-rays in the past sixty years should be attributed to the cooperation of various scientific departments.

The discovery and utilization of atomic energy are inseparable from the discovery of X-rays. The year after the discovery of X-rays (1896), Becquerel discovered natural radioactivity. Then, Marie Curie discovered radium three years later (1898). After forty-seven years of research (until December 1942), human society has entered the atomic age. Although atomic energy has been used by American imperialists for mass killings and atomic blackmail, justice will eventually triumph over evil. The Soviet Union has built the first atomic power plant in history, providing an endless source of power. The creation of hundreds of radioactive isotopes has provided inexpensive diagnostic and therapeutic materials and industrial tools for testing the quality of steel.

X-rays, a discovery that benefits mankind, is worthy of our commemoration. And Professor Röntgen's thorough research spirit and humility are worthy of our scientific workers to emulate.

The Republic of India has invited radiology experts from various countries to hold a grand commemorative meeting today. Let us wish the conference a success from afar. And may we promote friendly cooperation between countries while exchanging academic ideas.

    纪念爱克斯线发现六十周年
    中华医学会总会放射学会副主任委员　余贻倜
    透视物体内部构造，包括人们自己的身体是人类几千年来的愿望和幻想。这幻想终于在距今六十年前——一八九五年十一月八日实现了。这就是爱克斯线的发现。
    当时全世界物理学界都集中精力于阴极线的研究。在德国各大学担任物理学教授的伦琴（一八四五——一九二三）当然也不例外。在一八九五年以前盖斯那氏、克鲁克斯氏、列拉氏等曾经做了很多“通过低气压的放电现象”的试验。
    人们常常从平凡的事物发现大自然的奥秘。例如牛顿见苹果落地而悟万有引力，瓦特见水壶盖被水蒸气冲开而发明蒸气机。但这些发明发现并不是偶然的。必须有锐敏的观察力和科学的预见才能抓住这些自然现象。盖斯那氏在真空管内放电试验中，无意中产生了爱克斯线，他企图用照像玻璃板撮影，但他没有料想到这种不可见的射线能够透过照像玻璃板的包装使玻璃板曝光。在试验时他把照像玻璃板毫无隔离地放在真空管的近旁，以致照像玻璃板在撮影前已经曝光。反复试验都失败了，最后只得中止。伦琴在一八九四年春再一次从头进行“通过低气压的放电现象”的研究。他所用的仪器是有铝制窗孔的列拉氏真空管和涂上氰化铂钡结晶的硬纸萤光板。他并没有预想或计划发现爱克斯线，只不过企图证明赫兹氏的实验是否正确：阴极线能穿透金属薄片。但试验时真空管发出的光亮妨碍工作。他想阴极线既然能穿透木板和金属，那末，把真空管包上黑纸当然仍能透过。果然证实某种不可见的光线透过包扎的黑纸使氰化铂钡萤光板发生萤光。他又把手放在真空管与萤光板之间，发现萤光板上出现了手骨的黑影。由于发生萤光推想到也必有光化作用，就试用伦琴夫人的手撮影。这就是历史上第一张爱克斯线照片。因为还没有观察出这种不可见光线的物理性质，只好用代数学的未知数代表它，称为爱克斯线。
    爱克斯线撮影原先不过是研究方法之一，现在却变为研究的目的。爱克斯线发现后，各国的报纸竞先以“不透明体的透过摄影”，“透过万物的放射线”和“对骨折和骨疾病的特殊诊断法”等为题传播全世界。世界各国凡有真空管设备的研究所争先实验爱克斯线摄影，研究论文发表后一周间，全世界已经摄影数百张。一八九六年一月六日伦琴宣布他发现的爱克斯线。第二天就已经有人应用这种新放射线来为一个妇女取出扎进手掌内的针。这是物理学的研究成果最快应用于医学的唯一范例。爱克斯线发现后半年成立了第一个放射学会，并出版了一个名为“临床照片”的杂志。
    作为一个科学家，伦琴值得我们学习的是他研究的彻底性和谦逊态度。他虽然取得了科学界最高的荣誉，获得了多数的奖章和第一届诺贝尔物理学奖，但他谦逊地没有举行纪念讲演。他辞退了柏林国立物理学会会长的名誉职，辞谢了德意志帝国贵族的勋位，继续夜以继日地钻研。一八九五年十二月二十八日的论文阐明新放射线在暗室内能使氰化铂钡纸板发生萤光，无论在纸板的表面或背面，甚至距离二公尺也能发光。他用各种物质试验，包括纸片，木板，橡皮，各种液体，各种金属，各种矿物，证明物质的密度不是爱克斯线穿透率的决定因素。更进一步证明新发现的放射线和阴极线性质完全不同：它对分光镜不屈折，在空气中被吸收，在磁场内不发生偏倚现象。一八九六年三月九日第二篇研究论文追加爱克斯线的物理作用：它有电离作用，它通过气体时气体就变为导电体。一切物质与阴极线冲突都能发生爱克斯线，但程度不等。阳极对阴极的轴需要作四十五度以下的倾斜，这些对爱克斯线管的制造给予很大的启示。一八九七年五月发表的第三次研究报告更进一步包括了很多的新发现：空气显著地使爱克斯线散乱。从真空管里发射出来的爱克斯线是一种混合放射线，其性质随电压的高低而异。像伦琴这样不满足不停止于既得的成就而继续不断地发现新问题，并且准确彻底地加以解决的科学家是值得我们学习的。
    更难能可贵的是伦琴救死扶伤的人道主义精神。当时正是第一次世界大战前资本主义的烂熟时期。把发明发现当作商品，争夺专利权，在广告上夸大宣传或隐慝新发明新发现。而伦琴虽拥有轰动全世界的新发现，独主张凡有益于人类，对病人有疗效的仪器药品都应该无条件地公开，不得据为私有。当德国最大的西门子电厂提出收买他的专利权时，伦琴斩钉截铁地回答：“我不要求专利。爱克斯线不是我发现的。爱克斯线是一切利用爱克斯线的人们的公有物。我相信爱克斯线还有很多研究的余地。我决不想独占自己的研究成果。对于有志研究的人，我愿提供我的一切著作和仪器设备。”
    在资本主义社会，有益于人类的工具往往被利用于邪恶的用途：爱克斯线的功用竟被歪曲成为：可以偷看保险柜的内容和外交官的秘密文件；用一排真空管可以了望敌军的阵势。纽约哥伦比亚大学
  一个学生甚至对报界发表用爱克斯线在三小时内能把一角三分钱的金属变成一百五十三枚金元。美国多伦多州议会议员李德竟无知到误解爱克斯线能够窥见裸体，因而认为是违反道德的，他提出一件法案：今后禁止使用爱克斯线观剧用望远镜。至于爱克斯线发现者为谁的争论和诬蔑伦琴的谣言曾经传播了很长一个时期。但是伦琴的功绩是淹没不了的。爱克斯线在医学上虽不是万能的，但它应用范围的广泛性和诊断的准确性是其他科学研究成果中前所未有的。它不仅能探察骨折和骨病，而且能观察内脏的病理变化。它不仅指示脏器形态的改变，同时揭露内脏的运动机能的失常。病理解剖和活体检查的对象是与人体割断联系的脏器和组织，爱克斯线检查的对象则是生活体的有生命的脏器和组织。这一点是爱克斯线比较病理检查的优越性。爱克斯线诊断学在医学科学研究上和临床应用上已经占了很重要的地位。初期的爱克斯线机发射的线量少，穿透力弱。三十年前所用的底片是玻璃板，感光慢，粒子粗，撮一张照片需要半点钟以上的时间，常常烧伤皮肤，造成医疗事故。德国汉堡的圣格俄克医院就有一个由于爱克斯线和镭锭治疗的牺牲者一百六十人的纪念碑。现在已经有了高达十五万伏特、一千毫安培的机器，照像底片改用感光快、粒子细的软片或胶卷；缩短了曝光时间，提高了穿透力和照片的清晰度。近年来电子学更推进了透视术，影像的明亮度能够放大到三百至三千倍，并且不必在暗室，可以在明亮的地方进行透视。以前只能在透视下观察的内脏——例如心脏血管的搏动，现在可以用计波摄影正确地记录下来。并以最快的速度连续拍摄胃肠道的蠕动，使医生能对胃肠的机能得到全面的了解。由于多种造影法的创造，现在不仅能观察胃肠支气管等空腔脏器，而且能观察肾脏、胆囊以至肝脏血管和脑血管、脑瘤的部位范围和性质。爱克斯线诊断学已经成为医学的重要分科，它的范围将日益扩大和复杂化。在预防医学方面，快速而廉价的萤光缩影（又名间接摄影）已经不算新奇。但在资本主义国家里至今未能普及。只有在社会主义的苏联才有可能不仅应用于集体胸部检查来搜寻早期肺结核，而且进一步应用于胃肠骨骼的集体检查来早期发现癌瘤。
    普遍性仅次于结核而危害性远远超过结核病的癌瘤只有少数可以施行手术。对这一危害人类的恶症，镭锭和爱克斯线深部治疗是最有效的医疗工具。原子能研究的进展，产生了八百余种放射性同位素。镭锭的位置将有被廉价的放射性同位素取而代之的趋势。但在最近的将来爱克斯线仍不失为对癌瘤与手术和镭锭并列的治疗法。六十年来爱克斯线的进展应当归功于各科学部门的合作。
    原子能的发现和利用是和爱克斯线的发现分不开的。爱克斯线发现的次年（一八九六年）柏斯魁氏发现了自然放射能。接着居里夫人在三年后（一八九八年）发现了镭。经过四十七年（到一九四二年十二月）的研究，人类社会已经进入了原子时代。德国明兴国立博物院内伦琴纪念碑碑文作了恰如其分的概括：“命名为伦琴线的放射线对医学揭露了人体的内部；对工业指示工业器材的本质；对科学揭露了原子的内部构造。”原子能虽然曾经被美帝国主义者用于大量杀人和原子讹诈，但正义终究要战胜罪恶。苏联已经建成了历史上第一座原子能发电站，提供了无尽的动力来源。数以百计的放射性同位素的创造，提供了廉价的诊断治疗物质和工业用检验钢材品质的工具。
    爱克斯线，这一造福人类的发现是值得我们纪念的。而伦琴教授彻底的研究精神和谦逊态度是值得我们科学工作者效法的。
    印度共和国邀请了各国放射学专家，将在今天举行盛大的纪念会。让我们遥祝大会的成功。并愿在学术交流的同时增进国际间的友好合作。
