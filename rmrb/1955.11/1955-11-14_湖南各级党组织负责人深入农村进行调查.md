Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 13th: Leading cadres of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) organizations at all levels in Hunan Province have recently gone deep into rural areas to conduct investigation and research work. After investigation and research, the leading cadres of the CCP organizations at all levels generally understand the new changes in class relations and class struggle in rural areas after the land reform, and the ideological trends of farmers of all strata in the agricultural cooperation movement. Thus, they have further overcome the right-leaning thoughts in leading the cooperation movement and revised the preliminary plan for developing agricultural producers' cooperatives.

After more than a month of class investigation in Hexin Township, the secretary of the CCP Changsha County Committee discovered that poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for 57 percent of the township, and 75 percent of them were eager to join the cooperatives. He helped Hexin Township formulate a cooperative plan for the entire township based on this situation, which corrected the tendency to exclude poor peasants from joining the cooperatives. As a result, all the poor peasants in the township were excited. Now, among the 158 poor peasant households, only six have not yet expressed their desire to join the cooperatives. Hexin Township originally planned to achieve basic cooperation by the spring of 1957, but now it plans to achieve it by the spring of next year. The county is now piloting the work of formulating agricultural cooperation plans in more than ten townships across the county.

Fan Diwen, the secretary of the CCP Bai Lin District Committee of Xiangyin County, on the shore of Dongting Lake, saw that five well-to-do middle peasant households often wanted to withdraw from the cooperative when he led farmers to set up cooperatives in Litang Township last year. He believed that the peasants' enthusiasm for joining the cooperative was not high, and he shouted that cooperation was "rushing forward." Recently, he conducted a serious investigation in Litang, Jixiang and other townships. The results showed that 90 percent of the poor peasants who have not joined the cooperative now urgently want to join, 70 percent of the new lower-middle peasants want to join, and 63 percent of the old lower-middle peasants want to join. Poor peasant Li Zhengqing moved twice in order to join the cooperative. After he informed the party branches of the townships about this situation for discussion, the number of farm households in the district planning to participate in the cooperatives this winter and next spring was expanded from the original 50 percent of the total farm households to more than 60 percent.

Yuan Danchu, secretary of the CCP Huangshajie District Committee of Yueyang County, used to think that it was not good to have too many cooperatives, which would bring difficulties to other work. After conducting in-depth investigations in rural areas this time, he concluded that: in townships with more cooperatives, the farmers' awareness improves quickly, and all work is easier; in townships with a poor foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation, the farmers' awareness is low, spontaneous capitalist forces are strong, and work is difficult.

Hua Guofeng, secretary of the CCP Xiangtan Prefectural Committee, published an article after conducting in-depth investigations in rural areas, saying: poor peasants in Caotang Township, Changsha County, account for 34.3 percent of the total households in the township; poor peasants in Qimei Township, Xiangtan County, account for 27 percent of the total households. In rural areas, the truly lonely, widowed, old, and weak actually only account for 4 to 5 percent of the rural population. In the past, some cadres believed that there were few poor peasants now, and they were all old, weak, disabled, and "lazy people" and could not be relied upon. This view is completely unfounded.

### 湖南各级党组织负责人深入农村进行调查

　　湖南各级党组织负责人深入农村进行调查
    新华社长沙十三日电　湖南省中共各级组织的负责人最近纷纷深入农村，进行调查研究工作。经过调查研究以后，各级中共组织的负责人一般都了解了土地改革以后农村阶级关系、阶级斗争的新变化，和各阶层农民在农业合作化运动中的思想动向，从而进一步克服了在领导合作化运动中的右倾思想，修订了发展农业生产合作社的初步规划。
    中共长沙县委书记在合心乡进行了一个多月的阶级考察工作后，发现这个乡里的贫农和下中农占百分之五十七，他们中间有百分之七十五迫切要求入社。他帮助合心乡根据这个情况制定了全乡的合作化规划，使排挤贫农入社的偏向得到了纠正。于是，全乡贫农都兴奋起来，现在一百五十八户贫农中，只有六户暂时还没有入社要求。合心乡原来计划到一九五七年春天才能达到基本合作化，现在计划到明年春天就可以实现了。这个县现在正在全县十多个乡里试行制定农业合作化规划的工作。
    洞庭湖滨中共湘阴县白临区区委书记范迪文去年在栗塘乡领导农民办社的时候，看到五户富裕中农常闹退社，就认为农民要求入社的情绪不高，并且叫喊合作化“冒进”了。最近他在栗塘、吉祥等乡认真进行了调查，结果发现没有入社的贫农中现在迫切要求入社的人占百分之九十，新下中农中占百分之七十，老下中农中占百分之六十三。贫农李正清为了要入社，曾经一连搬了两次家。他把这个情况通报到各乡党支部讨论以后，全区计划今冬明春参加合作社的农户，便由原来占总农户的百分之五十扩大到百分之六十以上。
    中共岳阳县黄沙街区区委书记袁旦初过去认为合作社多了不好办，还会给其他的工作带来困难。这次他深入农村调查以后得到的结论说：凡是合作社多的乡，农民觉悟提高快，一切工作都好做；互助合作基础较差的乡，农民觉悟低，资本主义自发势力大，工作就难做。
    中共湘潭地委书记华国锋在深入农村调查以后发表文章说：长沙县草塘乡贫农占全乡总户数百分之三十四点三；湘潭县棋梅乡贫农占总户数百分之二十七。农村中真正的孤寡老弱，实际上只占农村人口百分之四、五。过去有些干部认为现在贫农少，都是老弱残废、“懒汉”，不能作为依靠对象的看法，是完全没有根据的。
