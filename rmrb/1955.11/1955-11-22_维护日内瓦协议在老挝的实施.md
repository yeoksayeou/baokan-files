    Safeguarding the Implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos
    On November 10th, Souphanouvong, the representative of the Lao Fighting Units, wrote to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The letter pointed out that the Royal Lao Government had seriously violated the explicit provisions of the Geneva Accords, continuing to attack the Lao Fighting Units in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, and attempting to hold separate elections excluding the Lao side. Souphanouvong emphasized in the letter that the Royal Lao Government should immediately cease its attacks on the Lao Fighting Units, and that the Lao parties should seek a resolution of political issues through consultation so that the Lao Fighting Units can participate in the elections. Souphanouvong requested the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference to take all necessary measures to ensure that the provisions of the Geneva Accords relating to Laos are observed.
    Recently, the International Commission for Laos also submitted its second working report. The report expressed serious concern about the continued occurrence of armed conflicts in Laos and the obstruction of political settlements. The report called for an immediate cessation of armed conflicts in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly, and hoped that the Lao parties could seek and reach agreement on various political issues through consultation. The report also repeatedly emphasized that the Geneva Accords should be faithfully implemented in Laos. These propositions of the International Commission for Laos are consistent with the demands made by Souphanouvong in the aforementioned letter of November 10th.
    However, on the other hand, the United States Information Service reported on November 14th that the Royal Lao Government was preparing to request the Manila Treaty military group organized by the United States to "take appropriate measures" in Laos to gain control of the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. Subsequently, the United States Information Service clamored on November 15th that the meeting of the staff planning personnel of the Manila Treaty military group, which closed in Honolulu on that day, had "formulated plans for the defense of free Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia." The Associated Press also predicted on November 14th that a large-scale battle would break out in Laos, and "the spreading war may cause direct intervention by the countries of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." The United States is clearly not only unprepared to stop its illegal acts of instigating and financing the Royal Lao Government to attack the Lao Fighting Units, but also attempting to further use the organization of the Manila Treaty military group to expand the armed conflict in Laos. The Royal Lao Government also does not seem to realize the serious consequences that its actions taken under the direction of the United States will inevitably lead to.
    The United States' sabotage of the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos has been consistent and increasingly intensified. Shortly after the signing of the Geneva Accords, the United States organized the Manila Treaty military group, and disregarding the explicit provisions of the Geneva Accords prohibiting the inclusion of Indochinese countries into military blocs in any way, illegally included Indochinese countries such as Laos within the so-called "protected area" of this military group. The Geneva Accords clearly stipulated that the Lao parties should cease all armed conflicts, and the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly should be designated as assembly areas for the Lao Fighting Units. However, Dulles openly described the Lao Fighting Units as elements carrying out "subversive activities" in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly on March 8th this year, clamoring that the Royal Lao Government should boldly "suppress" them under the "protection" of the Manila Treaty military group. The Geneva Accords clearly stipulate that the entry of reinforcement war materials into Laos after the ceasefire is prohibited. However, the United States has provided the Royal Lao Government with a large amount of military equipment for more than a year. U.S. Senator Mansfield recently revealed that the U.S. "aid" to the Royal Lao Government now reaches 50 million U.S. dollars annually. Lao Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith also openly admitted that this U.S. aid is used to maintain the Lao National Army and purchase military equipment. The recent working report submitted by the International Commission for Laos also pointed out that the Royal Lao Government has not, as required by the International Commission, reported to the International Commission on a monthly basis the situation of war materials transported in the previous month, and the quantity, time, and location of war materials to be transported in the current month. Recently, with the assistance of the International Commission for Laos, the Lao parties reached an agreement in the Rangoon talks to cease armed conflicts and agreed to resolve various political issues through consultation, so as to achieve national unity and unification through national elections with the participation of the Lao side. However, the United States quickly planned and loudly clamored to carry out direct armed intervention in Laos through the Manila Treaty military group. The United States bears a serious responsibility for the fact that the implementation of the Geneva Accords has been undermined in Laos, the armed conflict has not yet ceased, and the resolution of political issues has been repeatedly obstructed.
    The Royal Lao Government has repeatedly stated that it is willing to "jointly implement the Geneva Accords with the Lao side, consolidate peace, bring freedom and democracy to the people, and achieve unity and national independence." The Royal Government has also stated that it is willing to "seek all possible ways to resolve all issues related to national independence through consultation, in order to achieve satisfactory results" with the Lao side. However, under the instigation and direction of the United States, the Royal Lao Government is increasingly being led onto a completely different path. The Royal Government, disregarding the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the cessation of all hostile acts and the designation of the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly as assembly areas for the Lao Fighting Units, dispatched a large number of troops into the two provinces to attack the Lao Fighting Units, provoking armed conflicts. On October 11th, Lao Prime Minister Katay Don Sasorith personally signed an agreement with Souphanouvong in the Rangoon talks to cease all hostile actions in the provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly. It was originally hoped that the armed conflicts in these two provinces would be completely stopped in accordance with this agreement on October 21st, so that the provisions of the Geneva Accords regarding the cessation of all hostile actions in Laos could finally be implemented. However, the agreement of October 11th was sabotaged by the Royal side on the very first day of its implementation.
    As for the Lao election issue, the Geneva Accords clearly stipulated that the Royal Lao Government should "take measures to enable all citizens to participate in the national common life, especially in the forthcoming general elections"; and that this general election should be held "under conditions of respect for fundamental freedoms" within 1955. The Lao Fighting Units' request to participate in the elections is fully in line with the provisions of the Geneva Accords. This is also a reasonable way to achieve peaceful unification in Laos. In the Rangoon talks, the Royal Government also agreed that various political issues should be resolved through consultation so that the Lao side could participate in the elections. At that time, both parties also agreed to task a political conference composed of representatives of both parties to continue discussions on the issue of general elections. However, in the political conference held in late October this year, the Royal side not only overturned the promises it had already made in the Rangoon talks, but also unilaterally interrupted the conference only ten days after it had just started, openly stating that it refused to continue negotiations with the Lao side. At the same time, the Royal Government is stepping up preparations to hold separate elections excluding the Lao side in its controlled areas on December 25th this year.
    Not only that, but there are even people in the Royal Lao Government who advocate allowing the Manila Treaty military group to carry out direct armed intervention in Laos. This is completely contrary to the Geneva Accords and the decisions of the Rangoon talks, and against the interests of the Lao people. For the sake of the peace, unity, and independence of Laos, the Royal Lao Government should return to the path prescribed by the Geneva Accords, stop the armed attacks on the Lao side, resume the political conference between the two parties, resolve various political issues in Laos through consultation, and hold truly democratic and free national elections with the participation of the Lao side.
    The People's Republic of China is one of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference and is a neighboring country with a common border with Laos. Any attempt to continue and expand the armed conflict in Laos by using the Manila Treaty military group will not only inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Lao people, but also will absolutely not be tolerated by China and all peace-loving countries that uphold the Geneva Accords. The Chinese people fully support the demands made by Souphanouvong in his letter of November 10th to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The Chinese people firmly believe that all parties concerned should respect the implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and safeguard the peace of Laos and Indochina.

### 维护日内瓦协议在老挝的实施

    维护日内瓦协议在老挝的实施
    十一月十日，寮国战斗部队代表苏发努冯写信给日内瓦会议的两位主席。信中指出：老挝王国政府严重违反了日内瓦协议的明文规定，继续在老挝的桑怒、丰沙里两省进攻寮国战斗部队，并且正在企图举行排斥寮方参加的单独选举。苏发努冯在信中强调：老挝王国政府应该立即停止对寮国战斗部队的进攻，而老挝双方应该通过协商求得政治问题的解决，使寮国战斗部队能够参加选举。苏发努冯要求日内瓦会议的两位主席采取一切必要措施，使日内瓦协议中有关老挝的条款得到遵守。
    最近，老挝国际委员会也提出了它的第二次工作报告。报告对老挝武装冲突的继续发生和政治解决的遭受阻碍，表示严重的关怀。报告要求立即停止在桑怒、丰沙里两省的武装冲突，希望老挝双方能够经由协商的方式，在各项政治问题上寻求并达成协议。报告并且再三强调日内瓦协议应该在老挝被忠实地实施。老挝国际委员会的这些主张，同苏发努冯在上述十一月十日的信中所提出的要求，是一致的。
    但是，另一方面，美国新闻处却在十一月十四日报道说：老挝王国政府，准备要求美国所组织的马尼拉条约军事集团在老挝“采取适当的措施”，来取得它对桑怒、丰沙里两省的控制。接着，美国新闻处在十一月十五日又叫嚣说：当天在檀香山闭会的马尼拉条约军事集团参谋计划人员会议，已经
  “制定了关于保卫自由越南、老挝和柬埔寨的计划”。美联社在十一月十四日还预言说：老挝将爆发大规模的战斗，“蔓延的战事可能引起东南亚条约组织国家的直接干涉”。美国显然不但不准备停止它唆使并且资助老挝王国政府进攻寮国战斗部队的非法行为，而且还企图进一步利用马尼拉条约军事集团的组织，扩大老挝的武装冲突。老挝王国政府也似乎还没有认识到它在美国指使之下所采取的各种行动将必然引起的严重后果。
    美国破坏日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，是一贯的，而且是变本加厉的。日内瓦协议签订后不久，美国就组织了马尼拉条约军事集团，不顾日内瓦协议禁止用任何方式把印度支那国家拉入军事集团的明文规定，非法地将老挝等印度支那国家划入这一军事集团的所谓“保护地区”之内。日内瓦协议明文规定老挝双方应该停止一切武装冲突，桑怒和丰沙里两省应该作为寮国战斗部队的集结区。但是，杜勒斯在今年三月八日却公然把寮国战斗部队说成是在桑怒、丰沙里两省进行“颠覆活动”的分子，叫嚣老挝王国政府在马尼拉条约军事集团的“保护”下放手加以“镇压”。日内瓦协议明文规定：禁止在停战后把增援性作战物资运入老挝。但是美国一年多来却提供了老挝王国政府大量的军事装备。美国参议员曼斯菲尔德最近曾透露，美国现在每年给老挝王国政府的“美援”，达到五千万美元。老挝王国首相克特·萨索里斯也公开承认：这些美援是用来维持老挝国民军并购买军事装备的。老挝国际委员会前不久所提出的工作报告中也已经指出：老挝王国政府并没有按照国际委员会的要求，逐月向国际委员会报告上月份运入作战物资的情况，和本月份准备运入作战物资的数量、时间和地点。最近，在老挝国际委员会的协助下，老挝双方在仰光会谈中就停止武装冲突达成了协议，并同意经由协商解决各项政治问题，通过有寮方参加的全国选举来实现全国的团结和统一。但是，美国却连忙策划并且大声叫嚣要通过马尼拉条约军事集团来对老挝进行直接的武装干涉。对于日内瓦协议的实施在老挝遭到破坏，武装冲突至今还没有停止，政治问题的解决一再遭到阻挠，美国负有严重的责任。
    老挝王国政府曾经一再表示，它愿意同寮方
  “共同履行日内瓦协议，巩固和平，给人民带来自由和民主，实现统一和达到国家独立。”王国政府并且曾经声明，它愿意同寮方“寻求一切可能的办法，通过协商解决一切有关国家独立的问题，以期取得圆满的结果。”但是，在美国的挑拨和指使下，老挝王国政府正日益被引上一条完全不同的道路。王国政府不顾日内瓦协议关于停止一切敌对行为和桑怒、丰沙里两省应该划为寮国战斗部队的集结区的规定，派遣了大批部队进入两省，进攻寮国战斗部队，挑起武装冲突。十月十一日，老挝王国首相克特·萨索里斯曾亲自在仰光会谈中同苏发努冯签订了在桑怒、丰沙里两省停止一切敌对行动的协议。人们原都希望这两省的武装冲突将会按照这一协议在十月二十一日完全停止，从而使日内瓦协议关于停止老挝的一切敌对行动的规定终于能够付诸实施。但是，十月十一日的协议在开始实施的第一天就又遭到了王国方面的破坏。
    至于老挝选举问题，日内瓦协议曾明白规定：老挝王国政府应该“采取使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活的措施，特别是参加最近的普选”；而这一普选应该在一九五五年内“在尊重基本自由的条件下”举行。寮国战斗部队要求参加选举是完全符合日内瓦协议的规定的。这也正是老挝实现和平统一的合理途径。在仰光会谈中，王国政府也曾经同意应该经由协商来解决各项政治问题，使寮方能够参加选举。双方当时并且协议责成双方代表所组成的政治会议，继续就普选问题进行讨论。但是在今年十月下旬召开的政治会议中，王国方面不但推翻了自己在仰光会谈中所已经作出的承诺，而且在会议刚召开不过十天就片面予以中断，公开声称它拒绝同寮方再继续谈判。与此同时，王国政府正加紧筹划在今年十二月二十五日在它的统治区内举行排斥寮方参加的单独选举。
    不但如此，老挝王国政府中竟然还有人主张让马尼拉条约军事集团对老挝进行直接的武装干涉。这更是完全违反日内瓦协议和仰光会谈的决定，违反老挝人民的利益的。为了老挝和平、统一和独立的利益，老挝王国政府应该回到日内瓦协议所规定的道路上来，停止对寮方的武装进攻，恢复双方政治会议，经由协商解决老挝各项政治问题，举行有寮方参加的真正民主自由的全国选举。
    中华人民共和国是日内瓦会议参加国之一，而且是同老挝有着共同边界的邻国。任何利用马尼拉条约军事集团继续和扩大老挝武装冲突的企图，将不但必然遭到老挝人民的坚决反对，而且也是中国和一切爱好和平、维护日内瓦协议的国家所绝对不能容许的。中国人民完全支持苏发努冯十一月十日给日内瓦会议两位主席的信中所提出的要求。中国人民坚决认为，一切有关方面都应该尊重日内瓦协议在老挝的实施，维护老挝和印度支那的和平。
