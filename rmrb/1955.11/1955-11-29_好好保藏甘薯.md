　　Properly Store Sweet Potatoes
　　Zhao Qi
    Recently, a large-scale sweet potato rot has occurred in the suburbs of Beijing. According to very incomplete statistics, 1.6 million jin of sweet potatoes have rotted in four districts, equivalent to several hundred thousand jin of grain. This issue should be taken seriously by rural workers and the broad masses of farmers in sweet potato producing areas.
    The large-scale rotting of sweet potatoes is due in some cases to harvesting too late, resulting in excessive moisture; in other cases, it is due to the failure to remove bruised potatoes during cellar storage; and in still other cases, it is due to improper temperature and humidity in the sweet potato cellars. These are some frequently occurring, often overlooked phenomena; however, it is these small things that often cause us to lose large quantities of sweet potatoes.
    Some people think that with agricultural cooperatives, the phenomenon of sweet potato rot will naturally not occur, and so they relax their attention to this issue. In fact, judging from the situation in the suburbs of Beijing, many of the rotted sweet potatoes are precisely those of the agricultural cooperatives. Agricultural cooperatives do indeed have the conditions to store sweet potatoes well, conditions that individual farmers do not have. However, whether it is individual farmers or agricultural cooperatives, they generally lack experience in storing large quantities of sweet potatoes. If rural workers cannot help agricultural cooperatives to fully utilize their favorable conditions, sweet potatoes may still rot, and even rot more.
    Regularly inspecting stored sweet potatoes is an effective way to prevent sweet potato rot. According to farmers' experience, sweet potatoes are most prone to rotting about half a month after entering the cellar and after the spring warm-up next year. During these two periods, regular inspections should be carried out, and if rot is discovered, it should be dealt with in a timely manner to prevent its development and spread. The cooperatives and farmers in the suburbs of Beijing who experienced large-scale sweet potato rot did not conduct timely inspections. This should attract people's attention. The experience of Liu Yongkui, a member of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Taihua Township, Nanbu County, Sichuan Province, in storing sweet potatoes in earth cellars, is worth promoting.
    Urban residents need to consume a certain amount of sweet potatoes. Supplying sweet potatoes to urban consumers as early as possible can not only appropriately reduce the task of storing fresh potatoes, but also save part of the staple food. The urban food supply departments should carry out this work as early as possible to avoid large-scale sweet potato rot.

### 好好保藏甘薯

　　好好保藏甘薯
　　赵起
    北京市郊区最近发生甘薯大量腐烂的现象。据很不完全的统计，四个区腐烂的甘薯已经有一百六十万斤，相当几十万斤粮食。这个问题，应该引起产薯区的农村工作人员和广大农民的严重注意。
    甘薯这样大量腐烂，有的是因为刨收过晚，水分太多；有的是因为在窖藏的时候没有剔出刨伤的薯块；有的是因为薯窖的温度、湿度不恰当。这是一些经常发生的、常常被人忽视的现象；但是，就是这些小事情，常使我们损失大量甘薯。
    有些人以为，有了农业合作社，自然不会发生甘薯腐烂的现象，于是放松了对于这个问题的注意。其实，从北京郊区的情况看，许多腐烂了的甘薯，正是农业合作社的。农业合作社确实有足以把甘薯贮藏好的、个体农民所没有的条件。但是，不管个体农民也好，农业合作社也好，一般地缺乏大量保藏甘薯的经验。农村工作人员如果不能帮助农业合作社充分运用它的有利条件，仍然可能腐烂甘薯，甚至烂得更多。
    必须经常检查窖藏的甘薯，这是防止甘薯腐烂的有效办法。根据农民的经验，甘薯在入窖以后半个月左右和明年春暖以后，最容易腐烂。在这两个时期，要经常进行检查，发现腐烂现象，及时加以处理，防止发展和蔓延。北京郊区大批腐烂甘薯的合作社和农户，都是没有及时进行检查的。这应该引起人们的注意。四川省南部县太华乡红光农业生产合作社社员刘永奎家打土窖藏甘薯的经验，是值得推广的。
    市镇居民需要消费一定数量的甘薯。把甘薯及早供应给市镇消费者，不但可以适当减轻贮藏鲜薯的任务，同时可以节约部分主粮。市镇粮食供应部门应该及早地进行这一工作，以免甘薯大量腐烂。
