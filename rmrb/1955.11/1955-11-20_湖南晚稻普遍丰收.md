Hunan's Late Rice Harvest Generally Abundant

The more than 5.3 million mu of continuous cropping and intercropping late rice planted in Hunan Province this year have generally yielded a bumper harvest. In Liling County, with over 620,000 mu of late rice, the average yield per mu is around 400 jin, with the highest reaching 500-600 jin, except for some low-lying and easily flooded fields. In the Changde Special District along the Dongting Lake plain, the late rice hastily planted after last year's floods mostly failed. This year, in the poldered fields surrounded by new dikes, the 1.6 million mu of late rice yielded 250 to 300 jin per mu. The total area of late rice in the district increased by 800,000 mu this year, and the yield per unit area also increased. The late rice harvest is more than double that of the bumper year of 1953.

　  湖南晚稻普遍丰收
    湖南省今年种植的五百三十多万亩连作和间作晚稻，普遍获得丰收。醴陵县六十二万多亩晚稻，除部分滂田、冲田外，一般每亩产量都在四百斤左右，最高的达五、六百斤。常德专区沿洞庭湖平原上，去年在水灾后赶插的晚稻大部分失收，今年在新堤环抱的垸田里，一百六十多万亩晚稻，每亩收谷二百五十斤到三百斤。全区今年晚稻面积扩大八十万亩，单位产量也提高，比丰收的一九五三年要多收一倍以上的晚稻。　（姚焕廷）
