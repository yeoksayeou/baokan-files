　　Controlling Water and Loess on the Plateau
　　Ye Hong
　　Wei River is one of the dozen or so major tributaries of the Yellow River on the Loess Plateau in Northwest China. Tianshui Prefecture in Gansu Province is located in the upper reaches of the Wei River. Ninety-one percent of the prefecture's cultivated land is mountainous. During the months of July, August, and September each year, rainfall is concentrated, and the Loess Plateau is eroded by floods into thousands of gullies. Therefore, this area is known as a "hilly and gully region." Severe soil erosion has damaged agricultural production. It is estimated that the fertile loess carried away annually by just one tributary of the Wei River – the Hulu River – could cover 700,000 mu of land with a five-inch thick layer, which is approximately equal to the cultivated layer of all the cultivated land in Wushan County, Tianshui Prefecture. According to a nine-year small-scale experiment by the Tianshui Soil and Water Conservation Work Promotion Station, on loess slopes with gradients of 5% to 35%, an average of 21,153 jin of water and 2,587 jin of fertile soil are lost per mu each year. At the same time, a large amount of loess flows into the Yellow River, increasing its sediment content and causing long-term disasters for the people downstream.
　　The purpose of soil and water conservation work is to control water and loess on the plateau, to create happiness for farmers in mountainous areas, and to prevent it from flowing downstream and causing disasters. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, Tianshui Prefecture has carried out soil and water conservation work in accordance with local conditions and by guiding actions according to circumstances. In arid areas, the Party and the government have mobilized the masses to dig wells, build water cellars, and excavate ponds to store floodwater to solve the problem of drinking water for humans and livestock. They have also widely built flood diversion channels to divert floodwater for irrigation, and used fallow land to plant alfalfa to increase land cover, while solving the problems of fuel, feed, and fertilizer locally. In areas with crisscrossing gullies, field projects such as building field ridges and digging land trench ditches are carried out first to keep most of the water and soil on the cultivated land, and then the gullies are managed in a planned way. In river valley areas, the main focus is on flood control projects, such as building flood control forests and repairing flood control channels. Since 1952, with the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, the scale of soil and water conservation has been expanding day by day. As of June this year, in the past three and a half years, Tianshui Prefecture has completed more than 1,651,000 mu of field projects, built more than 140,000 mu of terraced fields, planted more than 121,000 mu of alfalfa, planted more than 11,970,000 trees, built more than 23,000 flood interception earth dams, excavated more than 57,900 ponds and water cellars, and diverted floodwater to irrigate 1,991 mu of land. After the Second Session of the First National People's Congress passed the resolution on the comprehensive plan for fundamentally eliminating the Yellow River's water hazards and developing the Yellow River's water resources in July this year, the broad masses of people in the Tianshui area further realized that their work of building a field ridge and repairing an earth dam with a hoe and a shovel in the deep mountain gullies was not only to increase agricultural production for themselves, but also for the welfare of the broad masses of people downstream of the Yellow River and for the benefit of the great cause of socialist construction. Therefore, their enthusiasm for carrying out soil and water conservation work has been further enhanced. Since the beginning of July, the soil and water conservation work in Tianshui Prefecture has shifted from the stage of key pilot projects to a large-scale mass development stage. In the three months up to the end of September, field projects have been completed on more than 1,362,000 mu of land, which is equal to 82% of the field projects completed in the past three and a half years, and floodwater has been diverted to irrigate more than 20,300 mu of land, which is more than ten times the amount completed in the past three and a half years. Currently, only 35% of the land in the entire region that should have field ridges built still lacks them. By next year, Wushan, Gangu, Qin'an, and Zhangjiachuan counties can achieve "ridges on every piece of land"; by 1957, the entire region can achieve "ridges on every piece of land."
　　In the process of carrying out soil and water conservation work, Tianshui Prefecture once adopted the method of mobilizing scattered farmers to do projects on fragmented cultivated land, but the results of this method were extremely small. Experience has proved that only by relying on the development of agricultural cooperation can soil and water conservation work be carried out on a large scale. Tianshui Prefecture piloted eight agricultural production cooperatives in 1953, and by the spring of 1955, the number of cooperatives had developed to 1,288. Soil and water conservation work has also developed with the development of the cooperative movement. In 1952, soil and water conservation was only piloted in three townships, but now 177 townships and 931 villages in the entire region have become key areas for soil and water conservation. After the summer harvest this year, on the basis of the further development of the mass movement of cooperation, soil and water conservation has also shifted from the pilot stage to full-scale implementation. In the summer harvest of 1952, Dengjiabao Village in Wushan County organized four mutual aid teams. After the summer harvest, the team members actively built field ridges in some of the sloping land. In 1954, this township established an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative based on five mutual aid teams that had done a good job in soil and water conservation. At this time, the entire village fully launched soil and water conservation work, building field ridges in more than 2,000 mu of sloping land, achieving "ridges on every piece of land, ridges connected to each other"; at the bottom of the four large gullies, 273 flood interception earth dams were built, achieving "dams in every gully, dams storing water"; more than 100,000 poplar, willow, apple, and other trees were planted on the slopes, and more than 500 mu of alfalfa were mixed under the trees, achieving "trees and grass on every slope."
　　With the development of soil and water conservation work, many originally poor mountain gullies have begun to become prosperous mountain gullies. Before liberation, about 50 mu of farmland in Qingming Township, Gangu County, were washed away by floods every year, and more than 70 gullies were washed out throughout the township. Now, by relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, various field projects have been carried out on more than 15,400 mu of mountainous land in the entire township, turning sloping land into flat land; trees and grass have been planted in the originally barren red clay gullies, turning red gullies into green gullies, and now spring water is also flowing down. According to a survey in Niujiaping Village in this township, the yield of wheat per mu has increased from 112 jin to 280 jin. Tianjiazhuang Village in Tianshui County is located on the south bank of the Jie River. In the past, whenever mountain floods broke out, houses would be washed away, and furniture and livestock would be washed away. However, since 164 of the 180 households in the entire village participated in agricultural production cooperatives, a dense poplar forest has been built in the mountain bays and gullies. Now, the area of newly planted young forest has accounted for 23% of the total mountain area of the entire village; at the same time, valley weirs and dams have been built in ten deep gullies, and water and soil loss has been completely stopped in three gullies. In the past, one mu of sloping land could only produce 120 jin of grain; after terracing, each mu can produce 400 jin. The farmers said: Three mu of sloping land is not as good as one mu of terraced land. In the past, due to soil erosion and exposure of red soil, agricultural production in Xujia Township, Qin'an County, declined year by year. However, after the masses organized to carry out soil and water conservation, this situation changed. In 1949, the average yield per mu in this township was only 100 jin, but now the average yield per mu has reached more than 180 jin. Before liberation, the entire township lacked about 500,000 jin of food grain every year, but now there is a surplus of more than 120,000 jin every year. They plan to turn all the smaller gullies in the township into fertile fields by the end of 1957 on the basis of further development of cooperation, which is estimated to increase cultivated land by 1,000 mu. At the same time, they also plan to renovate and divert the Lujia River, which is expected to increase paddy fields by 60 mu. In the early days of liberation, the average grain harvest per person in the entire township was about 370 jin, but by 1957, the average grain harvest per person is likely to reach 744 jin.
　　With the vigorous development of agricultural cooperation and the construction of projects to fundamentally eliminate the Yellow River's water hazards and develop the Yellow River's water resources, Tianshui Prefecture will launch large-scale mass soil and water conservation work. The people of the Tianshui area have the confidence to turn the Loess Plateau with thousands of gullies into a beautiful homeland with green mountains and clear waters, and are determined to contribute to the great project of harnessing the Yellow River.

　　把水和黄土控制在高原上
　　叶红
    渭河是黄河在西北黄土高原上的十几条主要支流之一，甘肃省天水专区就在渭河上游。全专区百分之九十一的耕地都是山地，每年七、八、九几个月间，雨量集中，黄土高原被洪水冲刷成了千沟万壑。因此这个地区被称为“丘陵沟壑区”。严重的水土流失，破坏了农业生产。据估计仅渭河的一条支流——葫芦河，每年带走的肥沃黄土，就可以铺五寸厚的地表七十万亩，约等于天水专区武山县全县耕地的耕作层。据天水水土保持工作推广站九年来的小区试验，百分之五至百分之三十五度的黄土坡地上，每亩地每年平均要流失水分二万一千一百五十三斤，冲走肥土二千五百八十七斤。同时，大量的黄土汇注入黄河，使黄河增加了含砂量，给下游人民造成了长期的灾难。
    把水和黄土控制在高原上，为山区农民创造幸福，不让它泻到下游去制造灾害，这就是水土保持工作的目的。近几年来，天水专区在党的领导下，因地制宜、因势利导地开展了水土保持工作。在干旱地区，党和政府发动群众打井、打水窖、挖涝池，储蓄洪水以解决当地人畜饮水的困难问题，广修引洪渠道，以接引洪水浇地；利用轮歇地种植草木樨，增加土地被覆，同时解决当地燃料、饲料、肥料的问题。在沟壑纵横地区，先进行田间工程，如培地埂、挖地坎沟等，把大部水土留在耕地上，然后有计划地治理沟壑。在河谷地区，主要是进行防洪工程，如造防洪林、修防洪渠道等。自一九五二年开始，随着农村互助合作运动的开展，水土保持的规模日益扩大。截至今年六月，在三年半的时间内，天水专区已经完成了田间工程一百六十五万一千多亩、修梯田十四万多亩，种苜蓿和草木樨十二万一千多亩，植树一千一百九十七万多株，筑拦洪土坝二万三千多条，挖涝池、打水窖五万七千九百多个，引洪浇地一千九百九十一亩。今年七月间第一届全国人民代表大会第二次会议通过了关于根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利的综合规划的决议以后，天水地区的广大群众进一步地认识到：他们在深山沟壑中一锄一锨地培一条地埂，修一个土坝，不只是为了给自己增加农业产量，而且是为了黄河下游广大群众的福利，为了社会主义建设的伟大事业的利益。于是，他们对于进行水土保持工作的积极性更加提高了。自七月初起，天水专区的水土保持工作就由重点试办阶段转入了规模宏大的群众性的发展阶段。截至九月底的三个月中，已在一百三十六万二千多亩土地上完成了田间工程，等于过去三年半时间内所完成的田间工程百分之八十二，引洪浇地二万零三百多亩，等于过去三年半时间内所完成的十倍多。现在，全区应该培地埂的土地中仅剩下百分之三十五的地未培地埂了。到明年，武山、甘谷、秦安、张家川四个县可以做到“地地有埂”；到一九五七年，全区都可以达到“地地有埂”了。
    天水专区在进行水土保持工作过程中，曾采用过动员分散的农民在零星耕地上做工程的办法，但是这个办法的收效极其微小。经验证明，只有依靠农业合作化的发展，才能大规模地开展水土保持工作。天水专区自一九五三年试办了八个农业生产合作社，到一九五五年春季以前，合作社发展到了一千二百八十八个。水土保持工作也随着合作化运动的发展而发展，一九五二年只开始在三个乡试办水土保持，现在全区已经有一百七十七个乡和九百三十一个村变成了水土保持的重点。今年夏收后在合作化的群众运动进一步开展的基础上，水土保持也由试办阶段转入全面开展。武山县邓家堡村一九五二年夏收的时候组织了四个互助组，夏收后组员们积极地在一部分坡地里培了地埂。一九五四年这个乡以五个水土保持搞得好的互助组为基础，建立了一个农林牧生产合作社。这时候，全村就全面地展开了水土保持工作，在二千多亩坡地内培起地埂，做到了“地地有埂，埂埂相连”；在四条大沟的沟底上，筑起了防冲拦洪土坝二百七十三座，做到了
  “沟沟有坝，坝坝蓄水”；在斜坡上栽植了十万多株洋槐、柳、苹果等树，并在树下混种五百多亩草木穉，做到“坡坡有树有草”。
    水土保持工作的开展，许许多多本来贫瘠的山沟开始变成富庶的山沟了。甘谷县清明乡在解放前每年被洪水冲毁的农田总有五十亩左右，全乡被冲成的沟壑竟有七十多条。现在，由于依靠互助合作组织，在全乡一万五千四百多亩的山地上做了各种田间工程。使坡地变成了平地；在原来光秃秃的红胶土的沟壑中植树种草，使红沟变绿沟，现在泉水也流下来了。根据这个乡牛家坪村的调查，小麦每亩产量已由一百一十二斤提高到二百八十斤。天水县田家庄位于藉河南岸，过去每逢山洪暴发，总要冲毁房院、冲走家具和牲畜。但是自从全村一百八十户人家中有一百六十四户参加了农业生产合作社以后，在山湾沟壑间营造起茂密的洋槐林，现在新造幼林的面积已占到全村总山地面积的百分之二十三；同时在十条深沟里筑谷坊、打坝堰，现有三条沟已完全制止了水土流失。过去一亩坡地只能产一百二十斤粮食；修成梯田后每亩就能产四百斤。农民们说：三亩坡地，还顶不住一亩梯田。秦安县胥家乡过去因黄土流失，红土暴露，农业生产逐年下降。但是，群众组织起来进行水土保持以后，这种情况就有了改变。一九四九年这个乡每亩平均产量只有一百斤，现在每亩平均产量已达到一百八十斤以上，解放前全乡每年缺少口粮约五十多万斤，现在每年就有余粮十二万多斤了。他们计划在合作化进一步发展的基础上，到一九五七年底把全乡所有较小的沟壑都变成良田，估计共可增加耕地一千亩，同时还计划把逯家河加以整治改道，预计可增加水田六十亩。解放初期全乡每人平均收获粮食约三百七十斤，到一九五七年，每人平均粮食收获量就可能达到七百四十四斤。
    随着农业合作化的蓬勃发展，随着根治黄河水害和开发黄河水利工程的建设，天水专区将要更大规模地展开群众性的水土保持工作。天水地区人民有信心把千沟万壑的黄土高原变成山青水绿的美好家园，并且决心对治理黄河的伟大工程贡献力量。
