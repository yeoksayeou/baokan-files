    Requesting Japan to Return the Relics of Monk Xuanzang to China
    Shi Mingke
    The Tang Dynasty monk Xuanzang was born in 596 AD (the 16th year of the Kaihuang era of Emperor Wen of the Sui Dynasty) and passed away in 664 AD (the first year of the Linde era of Emperor Gaozong of the Tang Dynasty). Xuanzang not only made extensive contributions to Buddhism through his translations but also significantly promoted cultural exchange between ancient China and India. His work, "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," remains a valuable document for studying the cultural history of ancient Central Asia and India. The Chinese people (including Chinese Buddhists) have always held this cultural giant in high esteem.
    After Xuanzang's death, his remains were initially buried east of the Chan River in Chang'an, Shaanxi. In 667 AD, they were moved to the north of Fanzhou, where a pagoda and temple were built (now Xingjiao Temple in Chang'an, Shaanxi) to enshrine his relics. In the early Northern Song Dynasty, Xuanzang's skull was taken to Nanjing by the monk Kezheng, where a pagoda was built for its enshrinement. According to the "Zhizheng Jinling Zhi" of the Yuan Dynasty:
    "The pagoda is located east of the temple (referring to Tianxi Temple) and is where the skull of the Greatly Enlightened Master Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty is buried. The Nanjing monk Kezheng obtained it from Zige Temple in the Zhongnan Mountains of Chang'an in the first year of the Duan Gong era of the Song Dynasty (988 AD)."
    An earlier record can be found in the "Jingding Jiankang Zhi" of the Southern Song Dynasty:
    "In the first year of the Duan Gong era, the monk Kezheng went to the Zhongnan Mountains and obtained the skull of the Greatly Enlightened Master Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty. He built a pagoda in the temple to bury it."
    Before the Anti-Japanese War, some scholars in China investigated the location where Xuanzang's skull was buried in Nanjing but were unable to locate it due to their failure to connect with the Buddhist community. In fact, the raised area to the right of the Xuanzang Hall outside the Zhonghua Gate in Nanjing is the base of the pagoda (White Pagoda) that housed Xuanzang's skull.
    The location of Xuanzang's skull pagoda was originally the famous Changgan Temple of the Jin, Liang, Sui, and Tang dynasties. It was renamed Tianxi Temple in the Song Dynasty, Ci'en Jingzhong Temple in the Yuan Dynasty, and Bao'en Temple in the Ming Dynasty. The buildings of each dynasty were extremely magnificent, especially the scale of the Ming Dynasty. The glazed pagoda, known as the "Number One Pagoda in the World," was the center of the temple. This royal temple gradually declined towards the end of the Ming Dynasty. Although it underwent a restoration in the Qing Dynasty, it only encompassed a portion surrounding the glazed pagoda. Later, the glazed pagoda collapsed, and Xuanzang's skull pagoda was also destroyed. The Xuanzang Hall was likely a memorial built by monks later to honor Xuanzang.
    In early 1943, the invading Japanese army, stationed in Nanjing, destroyed the pagoda base to build houses, unearthing the large stone casket that contained Xuanzang's skull. Inside the stone casket, besides a small silver box containing the skull, there were also small gold Buddha statues, bronze incense burners and candlesticks, Song porcelain vases, ancient coins from the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, gold and silver jade artifacts, gems, corals, and other precious items. Both sides of the stone casket were engraved with inscriptions from the Song and Ming dynasties.
    The Song inscription reads:
    "The skull of the Greatly Enlightened Master Xuanzang of the Tang Dynasty was excavated during the Huang Chao rebellion. Now, Kezheng, the Master of Evolution of Changgan (Temple), obtained it from Chang'an and buried it here. Fifth day of the second month of the Dingmao year of the Tiansheng era (1027 AD). Disciples Tang Wenyu, his brothers Wende and Wenqing, Ding Hongshen, Liu Wenjin, and Zhang Ai, together contributed."
    The Ming inscription reads:
    "The Xuanzang Master Skull Pagoda was originally located east of Tianxi Temple. In the nineteenth year of the Hongwu era of the Great Ming Dynasty (1386 AD), Huang Fudeng, a disciple who received the Bodhisattva precepts, and ×××× (original characters are blurred), moved it to the top of the three pagodas on the south hill of the temple. Written respectfully by the teaching Bhikkhu Shouren in the tenth month of the winter of the year Bingyin."
    The above explanation shows that the pagoda containing Xuanzang's skull was built in Nanjing, as recorded in historical records and widely known to Buddhists. After the Japanese militarists unearthed Xuanzang's skull, they broke it into several pieces, one of which was taken to Japan. The current Japanese Foreign Minister, Mamoru Shigemitsu, was the one who oversaw this event. As for the portions remaining in China, after the liberation, the Chinese Buddhist Association, through its full investigation, learned that there were still five portions of Xuanzang's skull in our country: one enshrined in the pagoda on Xuanhu Mountain in Nanjing; one enshrined in the Liurong Temple in Guangzhou; one enshrined in the Tianjin Buddhist Association; one enshrined in the Jinci Temple in Chengdu; and one enshrined in the China Buddhist Association in Beijing—this portion was originally enshrined in a pagoda in Beihai Park (located within the current Beihai Park Stadium). After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries demolished the pagoda and abandoned Xuanzang's skull beneath the pagoda base, where it was left unattended. It was not until after liberation that the Chinese Buddhist Association retrieved it from the original pagoda base and enshrined it in the "Sarira Pavilion" of Guangji Temple.
    Since liberation, the Chinese Buddhist community, with the assistance of the Chinese government, has made various efforts to collect and preserve the relics of our Buddhist predecessors. We are preparing to hold a solemn commemoration of Xuanzang in 1956, coinciding with the 2,500th anniversary of the Nirvana of our Buddha, Shakyamuni. We hope that our Japanese Buddhist friends will be able to cooperate with us and find a way to return the portion of Xuanzang's relics that are in Japan to us. However, we recently heard that some people are attempting to transport the portion of Xuanzang's relics in Japan to Taiwan. We Chinese Buddhists strongly protest this. At the same time, we believe that this act, which harms the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people, will also be opposed by Japanese Buddhists! We hope that our Japanese Buddhist friends will stand up and stop this action! (Xinhua News Agency)

    要求日本把玄奘法师遗骨归还中国
    石鸣珂
    唐三藏玄奘法师，诞生于公元五九六年（隋文帝开皇十六年），逝世于公元六六四年（唐高宗麟德元年）。三藏不仅在佛教方面译著宏富，而且对古代中印文化的沟通，亦卓有贡献。其所著“大唐西域记”，至今仍为研究古代西域、印度文化史的珍贵文献。中国人民（包括中国佛教徒）对于这位文化巨匠，是一直怀着崇敬心情的。
    三藏逝世后，遗体初安葬于陕西长安滻水的东面；六六七年又迁葬于樊州的北面，建塔造寺（即现在陕西长安的兴教寺），供奉遗骨。到了北宋初年，玄奘法师的顶骨为僧人可政赍至南京，建塔供奉。据元代的“至正金陵志”中载：
    “塔在寺（按即天禧寺）之东，即葬唐三藏大遍觉玄奘法师顶骨之所。金陵僧可政，于宋端拱元年（即公元九八八年），得之于长安终南山紫阁寺。”
    记载更早的有南宋“景定建康志”：
    “端拱元年，僧可政往终南山，得唐三藏大遍觉玄奘法师顶骨，为建塔归瘗于寺。”
    抗日战争前，国内曾有些学者在南京调查埋葬玄奘法师顶骨的所在地，终以未能和佛教界取得联系，致未发现。实际上，现在南京中华门外的三藏殿右侧的隆起处，即玄奘法师的顶骨塔（白塔）塔基。
    玄奘法师的顶骨塔所在地，原是晋、梁、隋、唐著名的长干寺，宋改称天禧寺，元改称慈恩旌忠寺，明又改称报恩寺。历代的建筑都极宏伟，而明朝的规模尤大。当时号称为“天下第一塔”的琉璃塔为寺的中心。这个皇家大寺到明朝末年渐趋衰落，清代虽经过一度重修，也仅只是近绕琉璃塔的一部分。后来，琉璃塔倒毁，玄奘法师的顶骨塔也圮坏；三藏殿，当是后来僧人为瞻仰玄奘法师而修建的纪念物。
      一九四三年初，盘踞在南京的侵华日军，为了修建房屋，竟平毁塔基，掘出了埋葬玄奘法师顶骨的大石函。石函中除一银质小盒安置顶骨外，还附有金质的小佛像和铜质的香炉、烛台以及宋瓷瓶、唐、宋、元、明的古钱、金银玉器、宝石、珊瑚等珍物。石函的两面，并刻有宋、明两代的文字说明。
    宋的刻文是：
    “大唐三藏大遍觉法师玄奘顶骨，早因黄巢发掘，今长干（寺）演化大师可政于长安传得，于此葬之。天圣丁卯年（一○二七年）二月五日，同缘弟子唐文遇、弟文德、文庆、弟子丁洪审、弟子刘文进、弟子张霭。”
     明的刻文是：
    “玄奘法师顶骨塔，初在天禧寺之东冈；大明洪武十九年（一三八六年），受菩萨戒弟子黄福灯、××××（原字模糊）普宝，迁于寺之南冈三塔之上，是岁丙寅冬十月，传教比丘守仁谨志。”
    以上说明玄奘法师的顶骨建塔在南京，是志书所载，也是佛教徒所共知的事。日本军国主义者把玄奘法师的顶骨从地下掘出后，即打碎为数份，其中一份被劫至日本。现在日本政府外务相重光葵就是当年主持这件事的。留在国内的，解放后经中国佛教协会的全力调查，得知留在我国的玄奘法师的顶骨还有五份：一份供在南京玄湖山的塔中；一份供在广州六榕寺；一份供在天津佛教协会；一份供在成都近慈寺；一份供在北京中国佛教协会——这一份，原建塔供奉于北海公园（地址在现在的北海公园运动场内）。日本投降后，国民党反动派把塔拆毁，玄奘法师的顶骨弃置在塔基之下，无人过问。直到解放后，始由中国佛教协会从原塔基下取出，供奉在广济寺的“舍利阁”内。
    解放以来，我国佛教界在我国政府协助下，曾作过各种努力从事搜集、保全我国佛教先哲遗骨的工作。我们准备在一九五六年纪念我佛释迦牟尼湼槃二千五百周年的同时，对玄奘法师也举行庄严的纪念。我们希望，日本佛教界的朋友们将能够同我们合作，设法把存在日本的那部分玄奘法师的遗骨送还我们。但最近听说，竟有人企图将玄奘法师遗骨存在日本的一部分运至台湾。我们中国佛教徒对此提出严重的抗议。同时，我们相信，这种损害中日两国人民友好关系的举动，亦必为日本佛教徒所反对！我们希望日本佛教界的朋友们能起而制止这一行动！（新华社）
