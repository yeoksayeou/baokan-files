Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, November 5th: The opening ceremony of the Soviet Film Week, jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, was held on the afternoon of the 5th. The Soviet Film Week will be held in thirty cities across the country starting on November 7th.

Among those present at the opening ceremony were Shen Junru, Vice President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Culture and Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other Vice Ministers of various ministries; heads of various people's organizations; and people from all walks of life.

Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, Chakhalevich, General Representative of the Soviet Film Export Company in China, and other foreign envoys and diplomatic officials in China also attended the opening ceremony.

The opening ceremony was presided over by Wang Lanxi, Director of the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture.

Qian Junrui, Acting Minister of the Ministry of Culture and Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, delivered the opening speech. He extended warm welcome and heartfelt congratulations on the start of the Film Week on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. Qian Junrui said: Soviet films reflect the epic deeds of the Soviet people under the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party in carrying out socialist and communist construction for more than 30 years, and have created a series of artistic images of people's heroes fighting for the cause of communism. These films have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people. From 1949 to August 1955, the number of viewers of Soviet films officially screened in China reached 1,003 million. Soviet films have made tremendous contributions to consolidating and developing the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people and to promoting the earnest study of the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction by the entire Chinese people.

Li Haiqiu, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China, then spoke. He said: Holding Soviet Film Weeks in China and Chinese Film Weeks in the Soviet Union has become a fine tradition. It plays a significant role in enabling the people of our two countries to understand each other's creative activities and each other's lives. Li Haiqiu said: Soviet films serve the people and are one of the most important tools for instilling communist spirit and ardent love for the motherland in the people. He said: In the Soviet Union, films are closely linked to the pressing issues and tasks facing the Soviet people. Following the resolution of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU to vigorously develop socialist industry, the Soviet film industry has made certain achievements. In 1955, Soviet film studios released a total of 60 feature films, 90 popular science educational films, documentaries, and hundreds of short films. Many excellent feature films with high artistic quality about the lives of the Soviet people have been released. Films are widely used to disseminate and popularize the advanced experience of workers and peasants, and are used for teaching in primary, secondary, and tertiary institutions. This year, the Soviet film industry has achieved new technological achievements. The first wide-screen stereophonic cinema has been established in Moscow. Finally, Li Haiqiu used Chinese to wish the cultural ties between the two fraternal countries of the Soviet Union and China to be consolidated and developed.

After the opening ceremony, the Soviet film "True Friends" was shown.

    苏联驻华大使馆参赞李海秋接着讲话。他说：在中国举行苏联电影周以及在苏联举行中国电影周已成为优良的传统。它在使我们两国人民间相互了解彼此的创造性活动及彼此的生活方面，起着不小的作用。李海秋说：苏联的电影是为人民服务的，是向人民灌输共产主义精神和衷心热爱祖国精神的最重要的工具之一。他说：在苏联，电影紧密地联系着苏联人民所面临着的迫切问题和迫切任务。遵循着苏共中央七月全会大力发展社会主义工业的决议，苏联的电影事业已获得了一定的成就。一九五五年，苏联各电影制片厂共发行了六十部艺术片和九十部科学普及教育片、纪录片以及数百部小型影片。现已上映了不少有关苏联人们的生活的优秀的具有高度艺术水平的故事片。电影被广泛地运用来传播和普及工农业劳动者的先进经验，并在中、小学和高等学校中用于教学。今年，苏联电影事业取得了技术上的新成就。在莫斯科，建立了第一所宽银幕立体声电影院。最后，李海秋用中国话祝苏中两个兄弟国家的文化联系巩固和发展。
