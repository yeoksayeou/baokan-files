    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 9th: The foreign ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States held their eighth meeting on the 8th, after a three-day recess. Dulles chaired the meeting. The foreign ministers continued to discuss the first item on the agenda – European security and the German question.
    Pinay stated that discussions at the meeting in recent days had made little progress. According to him, the reason for this situation was that the participants did not understand the Soviet government's views on the procedures for holding free elections as a way to restore German unification.
    In discussing the issue of European security, Pinay tried hard to defend the Western countries' plan. He insisted that the Western countries had proposed to the Soviet Union a security plan that could eliminate all concerns, including all reasonable concerns of the Soviet Union. He added that this plan was subject to change, and we are ready to study any suggestions from Molotov, as long as we are not told that the security of the Soviet Union requires the abolition of our security conditions.
    Macmillan then spoke, saying that he intended to try to remove obstacles in the way of reaching a full agreement and pave the way for a compromise solution. However, he went on to say that the current problem lies in drafting some regulations and measures sufficient to ensure that a rearmed Germany does not become a threat to its neighbors. In this regard, he expressed disagreement with the Soviet delegation's view that the draft treaty on security guarantees proposed by the Western countries was insufficient because it ignored guarantees for the security of Germany's neighbors.
    According to Macmillan, the Western countries consciously did not list one by one the participants in the proposed guarantee treaty. However, the Western countries believe that it is highly desirable for Poland and Czechoslovakia on the one hand and Germany's western neighbors on the other to become parties to this treaty.
    According to Macmillan, the draft guarantee treaty proposed by the Western countries is a suggestion for when Germany decides to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. However, the Western countries have never had the view that it is impossible to conclude a guarantee treaty before Germany joins the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
    Macmillan believes that the Soviet proposal to establish an all-German committee is not a proposal for the reunification of Germany. He asked Molotov to agree to discuss the Western countries' proposals.
    Molotov then spoke (separately).
    After Molotov finished speaking, Dulles said that, in view of the serious significance of the speech just made, he would like to consider it before continuing the discussion.
    No one objected to the proposal for a recess.
    The foreign ministers will hold their next meeting on the morning of November 9.

### 四国外长会议继续讨论首项议程

    四国外长会议继续讨论首项议程
    据新华社讯　据塔斯社日内瓦九日讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长在休会三天之后，在八日举行第八次会议。杜勒斯担任会议主席。外交部长们继续讨论第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题。
    比内发言说，最近几天会议的讨论很少进展。照他说，造成这种局面的原因是与会者不了解苏联政府对于作为恢复德国统一的途径的自由选举的进行程序问题有什么意见。
    比内在谈到欧洲安全问题时竭力为西方国家的计划辩解。他硬说，西方国家已经向苏联提出了一个能够消除各种忧虑、包括苏联一切合理忧虑的安全计划。他又说，这个计划是可以改变的，我们准备研究莫洛托夫的任何建议，只要不对我们说：苏联的安全要求取消我们的安全条件。
    麦克米伦接着发言说，他打算设法消除取得完全协议的道路上的障碍，并且为取得折衷解决铺平道路。然而，他接着说，目前问题在于要草拟一些足以保证重新武装后的德国不致成为对邻邦的威胁的条例和措施。在这方面，他表示不同意苏联代表团这样的意见：西方国家所提出的关于安全保证的条约草案是不够的，因为它忽视了对德国邻邦的安全的保证。
    麦克米伦说，西方国家有意识地不一一列举会上所提出的保证条约的参加者。不过，西方国家认为下面这一点是十分合乎愿望的：波兰和捷克斯洛伐克为一方和德国的西方邻国为另一方成为这一条约的缔约国。
    据麦克米伦说，西方国家提出的保证条约草案，是在德国如果决定加入北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟的时候的建议。不过，西方国家从来也未曾有过这样一种观点，就是德国加入北大西洋公约组织之前，就不可能缔结保证条约。
    麦克米伦认为苏联提出的关于建立全德委员会的建议并不是一个关于重新统一德国问题的建议。他要求莫洛托夫同意讨论西方国家的建议。
    莫洛托夫接着发言（另发）。
    莫洛托夫发言完毕后，杜勒斯就说，由于考虑到刚才发言的严重意义，他希望在继续进行讨论以前先考虑一下。
    休会的建议没有人反对。
    外交部长们将在十一月九日上午举行下次会议。
