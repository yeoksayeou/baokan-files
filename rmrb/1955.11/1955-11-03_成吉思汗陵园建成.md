    The newly built Genghis Khan Mausoleum now stands atop the Ejin Horoo Khohog Nuur Mountain in Inner Mongolia.

    Construction began on May 5th of this year, and all work was completed on schedule by October 30th.

    The newly built Genghis Khan Mausoleum is a palace-style building with yellow and blue glazed tiles on the Mongolian yurt-style roof. It includes three parts: a memorial hall, two exhibition halls on the left and right, and a rear sleeping palace. There is also a guest house specifically for visitors. (Bai Gele)
