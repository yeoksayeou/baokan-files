　　We have Implemented the Policy of "Serving the Rural Economy"
　　Guo Ren, Director of Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory

　　The Shijiazhuang Power Machinery Factory is now producing a steam power machine – the boiler-tractor engine. The steam engine is one of the oldest in the history of power machinery development, and it is now enthusiastically welcomed by our farmer brothers. In recent months, we have received many inquiries and order letters every day, and we receive many people who come to negotiate orders every day. All the boiler-tractor engines stipulated in our factory's production plan for this year were ordered by early September. In mid-September, we set a plan to increase production, but still could not meet the requirements of the customers. According to the current incomplete statistics, next year's order requirements also cannot be met. Our factory's production tasks have always been "not enough to eat," and now it has become a "supply cannot meet demand," making the factory embark on the road to normal production for the first time.
　　This change is the result of our implementation of the policy of serving the rural economy.
　　We did not find this correct path all at once. From 1949 to the first half of 1952, our factory did not even have a fixed production target. We did whatever work we could get. To complete orders, we added people if we didn't have enough; as soon as we added people, there wasn't enough work to do, so we went to look for work again. In the second half of 1952, the higher authorities asked us to produce seven-inch walking plows. We did not go to the countryside to investigate the specific needs of the farmers, but only produced behind closed doors. As a result, although we produced many walking plows, they could not be sold, and we were forced to stop production in less than a year. We did not learn the correct lessons from this failure. On the contrary, we one-sidedly believed that the current countryside was not a market for industry. We put away the signboard of serving agriculture and began to face urban and industrial construction. In order to complete the output value plan, on the one hand, we asked the central competent department to assign some production tasks, and on the other hand, we sent people to large cities to contract for odd jobs. At this time, production management was in chaos, and we couldn't even make a plan for what products to produce each month. We were living in worry every day: we worried when there was no work to do, and we worried about not being able to deliver on time when we found work. The factory was often working overtime and rushing to produce. Because of shoddy workmanship, rework and waste products piled up, and some users refused to accept the goods, while others returned the goods. In a word, the factory was full of difficulties and overwhelmed.
　　It was at this time that we heard the central government's policy for local industry of "serving the rural economy and combining with the rural economy." Our minds became clear. We deeply examined the factory's production direction and our own management thinking, and realized that the reason for our past failures was due to our low awareness and capitalist management thinking. We only knew how to produce, but the purpose of production was not clear. We thought it was troublesome to serve agriculture and were unwilling to deal with scattered farmers. We only considered completing our factory's tasks and did not think from the overall perspective. With such thinking, it would not work no matter who we served. This was the root cause of our repeated setbacks. From then on, we made up our minds to resolutely follow the central government's policy.
　　After examining our thinking, we went to the countryside to understand the needs of the farmers. We found that after the farmers were organized, they demanded to improve labor efficiency, improve production tools, and use machines to replace manpower and animal power in order to achieve a large increase in production. At this time, some agricultural production cooperatives had already purchased diesel engines to drive waterwheels. However, diesel engines were not easy to master and often broke down, and the farmers were not completely satisfied. At this time, we thought: if we use small boiler-tractor engines to supply agricultural production cooperatives as power for irrigation and agricultural product processing, it may be suitable for the current situation in rural areas and may be welcomed by farmers. So we decided to design and trial-produce a seven-horsepower boiler-tractor engine.
　　The first seven-horsepower boiler-tractor engine was trial-produced in November 1954. We first performed pumping demonstrations in the factory and Baoding City. During the Spring Festival, we held a workers and peasants get-together, invited representatives of suburban farmers to visit the factory, and solicited their opinions. After formal production, we also provided specific assistance to the agricultural production cooperatives that used this machine first, examining the effect of the boiler-tractor engine and attracting the masses to visit. In May and June of this year, we organized a rural visiting group to carry machines to the countryside to perform pumping and grass-cutting demonstrations. In order to obtain guidance from the central departments and academic institutions, a performance was held in Beijing in July of this year under the auspices of the Third Ministry of Machine Building. These performances and key demonstrations have played a good role. The two agricultural production cooperatives in Xiguan and Beiguan in Xingtang County used boiler-tractor engines, and people came to visit in an endless stream. Especially during market days, the people who came to the market had to go to see it. In recent months, the boiler-tractor engine has become a topic of conversation for local farmers. Now all the agricultural production cooperatives in Xingtang County are considering buying boiler-tractor engines.
　　When the masses realized the benefits of the boiler-tractor engine and were preparing to adopt it, the first thing they considered was whether they could operate the machine. In order to solve the difficulty that farmers did not understand operating technology, we held boiler-tractor engine driver training classes and notified each customer to send people to participate. The study time was one and a half to two months. Our factory assigned technicians to give lectures, took out machines for practice, and extracted skilled workers for guidance. We held a total of four such training classes, and trained a total of 214 boiler-tractor engine drivers. Generally, those who have studied can master the normal operation of the machine after returning. Many agricultural production cooperatives dared to buy machines only when they knew that the factory could train operators on their behalf. Now we are cooperating with the government's water conservancy department to open a larger-scale training class and are gradually improving the training level.
　　In November last year, we further transferred a group of technicians and technical personnel and organized an external service team. If some users lacked technical strength, we would send people with higher technical skills to help them until their operators were more skilled before returning. If a machine malfunctions during use, as long as the user sends a letter, no matter how far away or how busy we are, we will quickly send someone to solve it until the machine is repaired and used normally before returning. After farmers adopted boiler-tractor engines, they encountered difficulties in purchasing various machine parts and accessories. For example, transmission belts are easy for us to buy, but it is difficult for farmers to handle; boiler water must be chemically treated, but farmers do not know where to buy medicines; it is especially difficult when accessories are broken. In order to solve these problems, in addition to attaching certain spare parts with the machine, the service team also undertook the work of purchasing chemical medicines and machine accessories on behalf of the users. As long as the user sends a letter, we will send it out immediately. We also took the initiative to visit users to check whether the users' use of the machine was appropriate, and solicit opinions, exchange experiences, and impart technology. Therefore, this organization played a very important role in the promotion of new products and has been well received by many users. Due to the needs of the work, the organization of the service team is gradually expanding and strengthening. However, in the future, there will be more and more machines in rural areas, and it is not enough to rely solely on the service force of each factory. We suggest that the relevant government departments should pay attention to organizing local technical forces to take on the technical instruction and repair work of using agricultural machinery in rural areas in the future.
　　We have also done a lot of work in reducing costs and improving quality. Since the seven-horsepower boiler-tractor engine was officially put into production this year, the cost has been reduced by 26.7%, and the selling price in the second half of the year has been reduced by 13.16% compared with the first half of the year. The quality of the products is also gradually improving. Recently, under the auspices of the Third Ministry of Machine Building, engineering technicians and university professors from relevant departments were invited to conduct technical calibration of the seven-horsepower boiler-tractor engine produced by our factory. As a result of the research, the specifications of the boiler-tractor engine were changed to two types, five horsepower and ten horsepower, so as to be more suitable for actual needs. The structural form has also been greatly changed, which can greatly reduce costs, increase output, and improve quality. Now we are drawing new design drawings and preparing for mass production next year.
　　Our implementation of the policy of serving the rural economy has completely changed the face of the factory. However, its greater effect is to promote agricultural production, increase farmers' income, promote the agricultural cooperation movement, and further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The following examples can prove this.
　　Youyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiguan, Xingtang County, Hebei Province, purchased a seven-horsepower boiler-tractor engine and used it to irrigate 160 mu of wheat. The average yield per mu was 76 jin more than last year. It irrigated 65 mu of corn, and the average yield per mu was 46 jin more than last year. It irrigated 315 mu of cotton, and the estimated yield per mu was 63 jin more than last year. The total increase in income per household for the 116 households in the cooperative was more than 65 yuan. Because of the drought, the output of individual households was not as good as last year. The cooperative members said: This year, it has not rained for a long time. Individual farmers harnessed donkeys, irrigated this piece, and let that piece be damaged by drought. There was no way to deal with it. Only the cooperative's land has green and lush seedlings and wet soil. As soon as the boiler-tractor engine started, it drove away the drought. Individual households were envious of the boiler-tractor engine. This reflects that the use of agricultural machinery has a great effect on attracting farmers to participate in the agricultural cooperation movement. Using a boiler-tractor engine to irrigate land is also less expensive than using animal-powered waterwheels. According to the calculation of Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingtang County, the cost of using animal-powered waterwheels is six times higher than that of using boiler-tractor engines; moreover, irrigating with a boiler-tractor engine can resist drought for nine days, while irrigating with a waterwheel can only resist drought for four days.
　　Boiler-tractor engines can not only be used for irrigation to increase agricultural production, but also can be put into sideline production after the autumn harvest. Wuyi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Beiguan, Xingtang County, uses a boiler-tractor engine to drive a machine mill, which can grind 2,000 jin of wheat or 10,000 jin of corn per day, which is equivalent to the labor of 25 people and 25 livestock for one day. After the new cotton was on the market, they signed a contract with the county supply and marketing cooperative to process and gin cotton. Using a boiler-tractor engine to drive three cotton gins and one cotton cleaner, they can gin 800 to 900 jin of cotton per day, which is equivalent to the labor of 50 to 60 people, and can earn 110 to 120 yuan in processing fees per day.
　　After seeing the role played by the boiler-tractor engine, we gradually realized more deeply the great responsibility of state-owned industry in consolidating and strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. We are determined to further improve our technical level, improve enterprise management, carry out labor competitions, and produce more and better agricultural machines to support agriculture, and join hands with our farmer brothers to strive for the early realization of a free and happy socialist society.

### 我们执行了“为农村经济服务”的方针

　　我们执行了“为农村经济服务”的方针
　　石家庄动力机械厂厂长　郭韧
    石家庄动力机械厂现在生产一种蒸汽动力——锅驼机。蒸汽机是动力机发展史上最古老的一种，现在又得到了农民兄弟的热烈欢迎。近几个月来，我们每天都要收到许多询问的和订货的信，每天要接待许多商洽订货的人。我厂今年的生产计划所规定的全部锅驼机，九月初便被订购完了。九月中旬，我们订了增产计划，但是仍然没有能满足订户的要求。根据现有的不完全的统计，明年的订货要求也不能满足。我厂历年来的生产任务总是“吃不饱”，现在变成了“供不应求”，使工厂第一次走上了正常生产的道路。
    这个变化，是我们贯彻执行了为农村经济服务的方针的结果。
    这条正确的道路，我们不是一下子找到的。一九四九年到一九五二年上半年，我厂连固定的生产对象都没有，承揽到什么活，就做什么活。为完成订货，人不够，就添人；人刚添了，活又不够做了，就再去找活。一九五二年下半年，上级要我们生产七吋步犁。我们不到农村去调查农民的具体需要，只是关门生产。结果虽然生产出了许多步犁，但是销不出去，不到一年就被迫停止了生产。我们从这次失败中没有得到正确的教训，反而片面地认为目前的农村不是工业的市场，收拾起为农业服务的招牌，开始面向城市和工业建设。为了完成产值计划，我们一方面向中央主管部门要求分给一些生产任务，一方面派人到大城市承揽零货。这时，生产管理一片混乱，每个月要生产些什么产品，连计划都订不出来。天天过着发愁的日子：没活做的时候发愁，找到了活又愁着到期交不了。工厂是经常地加班加点，突击生产。因为粗制滥造，返修品和废品成堆，用户有的拒绝收货，有的退货。一句话，工厂是困难重重，焦头烂额。
    正在这个时候，我们听到了中央对地方工业所规定的“为农村经济服务，并且同农村经济相结合”的方针，我们的头脑才清醒了。我们深刻地检查了工厂的生产方向和自己的经营思想，认识到过去所以失败都是由于我们的觉悟不高和有资本主义的经营思想。我们只知道生产，但是生产的目的性不明确。我们嫌为农业服务麻烦，不愿意同分散的农民打交道。只考虑完成本厂的任务，而不从全局着想，有这样的思想不论为谁服务都是不行的，这是我们屡次碰壁的根源。从此，我们下定了决心：坚决地按照中央的方针去做。
    检查了思想以后，我们便到农村去了解农民的需要。我们发现，农民在组织起来以后，要求提高劳动效率，要求改进生产工具，要求使用机器代替人力、畜力，以达到大量地增产。这时，有的农业生产合作社已经购买了柴油机带动水车。但是，柴油机不易掌握，常出故障，农民还不完全满意。这时我们便想：如果用小型的锅驼机来供给农业生产合作社作为灌溉和农产品加工的动力，可能适合农村目前的情况，可能受到农民的欢迎，于是我们便决定了设计和试制七马力锅驼机。
    第一台七马力锅驼机在一九五四年的十一月试制出来了。我们先在工厂和保定市进行了抽水表演，春节期间又举办了工农联欢会，邀请郊区农民代表来厂参观，征求他们的意见。正式生产以后，我们又对最先使用这种机器的农业生产合作社进行了具体帮助，一面考察锅驼机的效果，一面吸引群众来参观。今年五、六月间，我们又组织了农村访问团，携带机器下乡进行抽水、铡草表演。为了取得中央有关部门和学术机关的指导，在第三机械工业部主持下，今年七月又在北京进行了表演。这些表演和重点示范都起了良好的作用。行唐县西关和北关的两个农业生产合作社使用锅驼机，参观的人络绎不绝。特别是逢集的时候，赶集的群众都要去看。在最近几个月里，锅驼机成了当地农民的谈话资料。现在行唐县的各个农业生产合作社都盘算着要购买锅驼机。
    群众认识了锅驼机的好处并且准备采用的时候，首先考虑自己是否能操纵这个机器。为了解决农民不懂操作技术的困难，我们举办了锅驼机司机训练班，通知各个订货户派人参加。学习时间是一个半月到两个月，由我厂指派技术人员讲课，抽出机器供实习用，抽出技术工人进行辅导。这样的训练班我们一共举办了四期，共训练出了二百一十四名锅驼机的司机人员。凡学习过的，回去后一般都能掌握机器正常运转。许多农业生产合作社知道工厂能够代训操作人员，才敢于购买机器。现在我们正协同政府的水利部门开办了较大规模的训练班，并且在逐步地提高训练水平。
    去年十一月，我们又进一步抽调了一批技术工人和技术人员，组织了一个对外服务队。有的用户技术力量不足，我们就派技术比较高的人去帮助，直到他们的操作人员比较熟练之后再回来。如果机器在使用当中发生故障，用户只要来一封信，不论多么远，工作多么忙，我们总是很快地派人前去解决，直到把机器修好使用正常以后才回来。农民采用锅驼机以后，在采购各种机器零件和配件上发生了困难。比如，传动皮带在我们是容易购买的，农民却不好办；锅炉用水一定要经过化学处理，但是农民不知道在哪里买药品；尤其是配件坏了的时候更是困难。为了解决这些问题，我们除了随同机器附带一定的备件之外，还由服务队担负了代办化学药品和机器配件的工作，只要用户来信，我们立刻寄出。我们还主动地到各用户那里去巡视访问，检查用户对机器的使用是否得当，并征求意见，交流经验，传授技术。因此，这个组织在新产品的推广工作中发挥了极大的作用，得到了许多用户的好评。由于工作的需要，现在服务队的组织正在逐步扩大和加强。但是，今后农村中机器越来越多，只靠各工厂的服务力量是不够的，我们建议政府有关部门应该注意组织地方性的技术力量来担任今后农村中使用农业机械的技术传授和修配工作。
    我们在降低成本、提高质量方面，也做了许多工作。七马力锅驼机从今年正式生产以来，成本已降低了百分之二十六点七，下半年的售价比上半年降低了百分之十三点一六。产品的质量也在逐渐提高。最近在第三机械工业部的主持下，邀请了有关部门的工程技术人员和大学教授们对我厂出产的七马力锅驼机进行了技术标定。研究的结果，把锅驼机的规格改成了五马力和十马力两种，以便更适合于实际需要。构造形式也有了很大的改变，这样既可以大大降低成本，增加产量，又可以提高质量。现在我们正在绘制新的设计图纸，准备明年大量生产。
  我们实行了为农村经济服务的方针，使工厂的面貌彻底改变了。但是，它的更大的效果是能够促进农业增产，增加农民收入，能够推动农业合作化运动，进一步地巩固工农联盟。下面的几个实例，就可以证明这一点。
    河北省行唐县西关友谊农业生产合作社购买了一台七马力锅驼机，用它灌溉了小麦一百六十亩，每亩平均收成比去年多七十六斤，灌溉玉米六十五亩，每亩平均收成比去年多四十六斤，棉花三百一十五亩，估计收成每亩平均比去年多六十三斤，全社一百一十六户，平均每户增加收入六十五元多。而因为天旱，单干户的产量都不如去年。社员们说：今年长期不下雨，单干农民套着毛驴，浇了这块，旱坏了那块，眼看没有办法。只有社里的地都是青旺旺的苗子，湿呼呼的地皮，锅驼机嘣嘣地一开，赶走了旱灾，单干户们眼看着锅驼机发馋。这反映了使用农业机器对吸引农民参加农业合作化运动是有很大作用的。用锅驼机浇地，费用也比畜力水车少。据行唐县五一农业生产合作社计算，用畜力水车要比用锅驼机费用高六倍；而且，锅驼机浇一水能抗旱九天，水车浇一水只能抗旱四天。
    锅驼机不但能用来灌溉，增加农业生产，秋收以后，它还能投入副业生产。行唐县北关五一农业生产社用锅驼机带动机器磨，每天可磨小麦两千斤或玉米一万斤，顶二十五个人、二十五头牲口一天的劳动。新棉上市后，他们同县供销社订了加工轧棉花合同，用锅驼机带动三部轧花机，一部清花机，每天可轧花八百到九百斤，能顶五十到六十个人劳动，每天能挣加工费一百一、二十元。
    我们看到了锅驼机所起的作用以后，逐渐地更深刻地认识了国营工业在巩固和加强工农联盟中的重大责任。我们决心进一步提高技术水平，改进企业管理，开展劳动竞赛，生产出更多更好的农业机器来支援农业，同农民兄弟携起手来，为早日实现自由幸福的社会主义社会而奋斗。（附图片）
