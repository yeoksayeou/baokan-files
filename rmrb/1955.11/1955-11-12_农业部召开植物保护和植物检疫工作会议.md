Xinhua News Agency report: To ensure the completion of the production increase targets for grain, cotton, and other agricultural crops as stipulated in the First Five-Year Plan, the Ministry of Agriculture recently convened a national conference in Beijing on plant protection and plant quarantine work. In addition to formulating the tasks and specific measures for plant protection and plant quarantine in the next two years, the conference also studied the fulfillment of international plant protection and plant quarantine obligations.

The conference believes that plant protection work must actively expand the area for preventing and controlling diseases and pests, fully utilize pesticides and machinery, and combine agricultural measures to achieve early and thorough prevention and control in the future. Plant quarantine work must also be actively carried out in the future to strictly prohibit the introduction of dangerous pests into protected areas, to blockade epidemic areas, and to quickly eliminate locally occurring dangerous diseases and pests. In 1956 and 1957, all regions should focus on preventing and controlling diseases and pests of grain, cotton, and major industrial crops. The national plan for 1956 is to use pesticides to control diseases and pests on more than 360 million mu of land, striving to reach more than 450 million mu, and the plan for 1957 is to double the area on the basis of 1956. Within these two years, all regions should investigate the occurrence and distribution of internal quarantine diseases and pests, delineate protected areas and epidemic areas, and take protection, blockade, and elimination measures in protected areas and epidemic areas respectively for quarantine diseases and pests that have been preliminarily understood. The conference also requested all provinces to make long-term plans for plant protection and plant quarantine work.

In addition, the conference believes that fulfilling international plant protection and plant quarantine obligations is extremely important. The conference requires all provinces, cities, and autonomous regions to resolutely complete the tasks of plant protection and plant quarantine in order to welcome the Eighth International Plant Quarantine and Plant Protection Conference to be held in our country next year.

　　农业部召开植物保护和植物检疫工作会议
    据新华社讯　为保证完成第一个五年计划规定的粮、棉及其他农作物增产的任务，农业部最近在北京召开了全国植物保护和植物检疫工作会议。会议除拟定今后两年内植物保护和植物检疫的任务和具体措施外，还对履行国际植物保护和植物检疫的义务进行了研究。
    会议认为：植物保护工作在今后必须积极扩大防治病、虫的面积，充分使用药械，结合农业措施，做到及早、彻底防治。植物检疫工作今后也必须积极开展，严禁危险病虫传入保护区，封锁疫区，迅速肃清局部发生的危险病、虫。一九五六、一九五七两年各地要以防治粮、棉及主要技术作物的病、虫为主，全国在一九五六年计划用药剂防治病、虫三亿六千余万亩，争取达到四亿五千余万亩，一九五七年计划在一九五六年的基础上扩大一倍。在这两年内，各地要把对内检疫病、虫的发生和分布情况调查清楚，划定保护区和疫区，并对已初步了解情况的检疫病、虫，在保护区和疫区分别采取保护、封锁和肃清等措施。会议还要求各省做出植物保护和植物检疫工作的长远规划。
    此外，会议认为履行国际植物保护和植物检疫的义务极为重要。会议要求各省、市、自治区坚决完成植物保护和植物检疫的任务，以迎接明年在我国召开的第八届国际植物检疫和植物保护会议。
