Leading New Cooperatives to Do a Good Job in Collective Production

The more than 10,100 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Jiangxi Province have mostly投入集体生产, and the winter planting is not bad. However, there are also many cooperatives where production has not been successful or is not doing well, and some members are even working individually. For example, in the Shangrao Special District, among the 2,004 new cooperatives in nine counties including Fuliang and Poyang, more than 450 have chaotic production order, and some people are still working individually even after joining the cooperative.

Why does this phenomenon occur? It turns out that some rural workers, seeing that the high tide of cooperation had arrived, thought that "the criteria for establishing cooperatives have been relaxed and the conditions lowered," and that they could establish a large number of cooperatives without much effort. In Nancheng County, when establishing cooperatives, some comrades openly said: "Comrades, the peasants' enthusiasm for joining cooperatives is so high, let's hurry up! Problems can be fixed later." Because some workers were originally prepared to cook "half-cooked rice," some townships only held a conference to publicize and then asked the peasants to sign up to join the cooperative. In Tongji Township, Xinyu County, when establishing cooperatives, they held a conference for publicity on the first day, discussion on the second day, and launched enrollment to join the cooperative on the third day, and considered a cooperative established on the fifth day. The issues of how to join the cooperative with land, cattle, and farm implements have not been resolved, and production plans have not been made. The members have many opinions and are not in the mood to produce. How can such a cooperative do a good job in collective production?

Establishing cooperatives should focus on quality and should not cook "half-cooked rice." All localities should pay attention to leading the newly established cooperatives and doing a good job in collective production.

### 领导新社搞好集体生产

　　领导新社搞好集体生产
    江西省最近新建的一万零一百多个农业生产合作社，大部分都已投入集体生产，冬种搞得不坏。可是，也有不少的社，生产没有搞起来或者搞得不好，甚至有些社员还在单干。如上饶专区浮梁、鄱阳等九个县新建的二千零四个社，就有四百五十多个社生产秩序紊乱，有的人入了社还在单干。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？原来是一些农村工作人员看到合作化的高潮已经到来，以为“建社的尺度放宽了，条件降低了”，用不着费什么力气就可以把大批合作社建立起来。南城县在建社的时候，有的同志公开说：“同志们，农民入社情绪这么高，赶快干吧！出了问题将来补课。”因为有些工作人员原来就准备烧“夹生饭”，所以有的乡只开个大会宣传一下，就叫农民报名入社。新喻县一区通济乡在建社的时候，第一天开大会宣传，第二天讨论，第三天就发动报名入社，第五天就算建成了一个社。土地、耕牛、农具如何入社的问题，都没有解决，生产计划也没有订好，社员意见很多，没有心情生产。像这样的社，怎么能搞好集体生产呢？
    建社应该注重质量，而不应该做“夹生饭”。各地应该注意领导新建的社，搞好集体生产。
