Searching for Petroleum Resources for the Motherland

The Qaidam Basin in Qinghai Province has abundant petroleum reserves. Geological exploration personnel from all over the country are here, traversing mountains and rivers, working tirelessly to find petroleum resources for the motherland. This year, they will complete detailed geological surveys and general surveys covering an area of 10,000 square kilometers. Currently, in the oil-bearing structure area discovered last year, geological exploration personnel are conducting detailed exploration; in some remote and uninhabited places, good news of the discovery of new oil-bearing structures is constantly being reported.

　　为祖国寻找石油资源
    青海省柴达木盆地的石油蕴藏量很丰富。来自各地的地质勘探人员正在这里跋山涉水、不辞劳苦地为祖国寻找石油资源。今年，他们将要完成的地质详查和普查的面积达一万平方公里。现在，在去年发现的储油构造地区，地质勘探人员正在进行细致的探测；在一些人迹罕到的地方，不断地传出发现新的储油构造的捷报。
