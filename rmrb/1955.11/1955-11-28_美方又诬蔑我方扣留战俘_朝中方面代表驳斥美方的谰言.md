　　The US Side Again Slanders Our Side for Detaining Prisoners of War
　　Representatives from the Korean and Chinese Sides Refute the US Side's Absurdities
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, November 27th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: The Military Armistice Commission held a meeting on November 26th.

    At the meeting, the US side, reversing right and wrong, insisted that the Korean and Chinese sides were detaining US prisoners of war and demanded an explanation.

    Regarding this matter, Major General Zheng Guolu, the chief representative of the Korean and Chinese side, pointed out that it was none other than the US side that detained a large number of prisoners of war.

    The whole world knows that in June 1953, the US side and the Lee Seung-man clique forcibly detained more than 27,000 prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese side under the pretext of "escape." After receiving a protest from the Korean and Chinese side, General Clark, then commander-in-chief of the US side, reluctantly agreed to continue efforts to recover the "escaped" prisoners of war. Despite this, the US side has not provided any explanation for even one of them to this day.

    The US side also violated the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and disregarded the resolutions of the commission, kidnapping more than 21,000 prisoners of war in January 1954 and forcibly incorporating them into the South Korean army and Chiang Kai-shek's army in Taiwan.

    In addition, the US side has not yet provided an explanation for the list of 98,742 prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese side submitted by the Korean and Chinese side on September 21, 1953.

    Major General Zheng Guolu pointed out that the US side must not evade responsibility for forcibly detaining a large number of prisoners of war and must provide a responsible explanation for this.

    Major General Zheng Guolu also said that as for the US prisoners of war in the prisoner-of-war camps of the Korean and Chinese side, they had long been repatriated or handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in accordance with the armistice agreement. The Korean and Chinese side has already given an account of the US prisoners of war who were released at the front, or who escaped, or who were killed in battle. The remains of deceased US prisoners of war have also been handed over to the US side in accordance with the detailed administrative understanding regarding the transfer of the remains of military personnel of both sides.

　　美方又诬蔑我方扣留战俘
　　朝中方面代表驳斥美方的谰言
    据新华社平壤二十七日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会在十一月二十六日举行了会议。
    在会议上，美方又颠倒是非地硬说朝中方面扣留着美方的战俘，并且要求作出交代。
    对于这件事，朝中方面首席委员郑国禄少将指出，大批扣留战俘的不是别人，正是美方。
    全世界都知道，美方和李承晚集团在一九五三年六月以“逃跑”为借口强迫扣留了朝中方面战俘两万七千多人。当时的美方总司令克拉克将军在接到朝中方面的抗议后，勉强答应继续努力追回“逃跑”的战俘。尽管如此，直到今天美方还没有对其中一个人作出任何交代。
    美方还违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”并且无视这个委员会的决议，在一九五四年一月绑架了两万一千多名战俘，并且把他们强迫编入南朝鲜军队和在台湾的蒋介石军队。
    此外，美方还没有对朝中方面在一九五三年九月二十一日提出的关于九万八千七百四十二名朝中方面战俘名单作出交代。
    郑国禄少将指出，美方决不能逃避强迫扣留大批战俘的责任，并且必须对此作出负责的交代。
    郑国禄少将又说，至于在朝中方面战俘营中的美方战俘，早已根据停战协定予以遣返或者移交给中立国遣返委员会。关于在前线释放的，或者逃亡的，或者在战斗中被打死的美方战俘，朝中方面已经作出了交代。美方已故战俘的尸体也已根据关于移交双方军事人员的尸体的详细行政谅解移交给美方。
