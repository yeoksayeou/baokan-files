Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 18th. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 18th regarding the Lao Foreign Minister Sananikone's answers to reporters published in the "New York Times" as reported by Agence France-Presse. The statement said that the dispatch mentioned that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam interfered in the resolution of Laos' political issues, sent political commissars and military cadres to be stationed with the Lao fighting forces, and continued to support the Lao fighting forces militarily and economically. The statement pointed out that these words are completely inconsistent with the facts.

The statement said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always believed that the Geneva Accords' resolution of the political issues between the government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao fighting forces is an internal Lao matter, and reaffirmed this policy in the statement issued in Bandung. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always respected this statement, and in particular hopes that the government of the Kingdom of Laos and the Lao fighting forces will find correct solutions to political and military issues in accordance with the Geneva Accords, and establish a unified, independent and peaceful Lao nation. The statement pointed out that there are currently no Vietnamese cadres stationed with the Lao fighting forces.

The statement said that the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly expressed its willingness to develop good-neighborly relations with the Kingdom of Laos, although the government of the Kingdom of Laos has not yet responded.

The statement also pointed out that, according to Agence France-Presse's report, the Lao government's attitude towards the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a complete violation of the Geneva Accords.

The statement said: The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is a party to the Geneva Accords. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam requests all parties concerned to thoroughly and strictly implement the Geneva Accords.

　　越南民主共和国外交部发言人发表声明
　  指出老挝王国外交大臣答记者问与事实不符
    新华社河内十八日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人十八日就法新社报道“纽约时报”所刊载的老挝王国外交大臣萨纳尼空答记者问，发表声明说，这篇电讯提到越南民主共和国干涉老挝的政治问题的解决，派遣政治委员和军事干部驻在寮国战斗部队那里，以及继续在军事和经济方面支持寮国战斗部队。声明指出，这些话完全不符合事实。
    声明说，越南民主共和国一直认为日内瓦协议解决老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间的政治问题是老挝内部的问题，在万隆发表的声明中曾经再一次肯定这个政策，越南民主共和国政府一直尊重这项声明，尤其是希望老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队方面找出关于政治和军事问题的正确的和符合于日内瓦协议的解决办法，建立一个统一、独立和和平的老挝国家。声明指出，目前没有任何一个越南的干部驻在寮国战斗部队那里。
    声明说，对于老挝王国，越南民主共和国曾经多次表示愿意发展睦邻关系，尽管老挝王国政府还没有答复。
    声明还指出，根据法新社的报道来看，老挝王国政府对于东南亚侵略条约的态度是完全违反日内瓦协议的。
    声明说：越南民主共和国政府是签订日内瓦协议的一方。越南民主共和国政府要求有关各方彻底地和严格地履行日内瓦协议。
