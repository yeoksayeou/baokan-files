　　Produce More, Better, and Cheaper Farm Tools for Farmers
　　Li Qian
    In the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory, workers are using their labor to support the agricultural collectivization movement.

    The Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory only began producing large-scale farm tools such as double-wheel double-share plows, twelve-row seeders, and horse-drawn wheat harvesters this year. In the beginning, the workers did not master the operating techniques, and the products produced did not meet the specifications. The workers organized "Technical Research Associations" and "Defective Product Appraisal Meetings," diligently learning the advanced production experience of fraternal factories and improving their technology, thereby exceeding the national plan in the third quarter. Compared with February, the cost of each double-wheel double-share plow was reduced by 17 yuan in August, and the cost of each twelve-row seeder was reduced by 80 yuan; the cost of each horse-drawn wheat harvester was reduced by 150 yuan. The defect rate in the third quarter was reduced by 18.6 percent compared to the first quarter.

    The publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the question of agricultural cooperation further encouraged the workers of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory. They asked themselves: "The high tide of the socialist transformation of agriculture is about to arrive. As workers who produce agricultural means of production, can we stand outside this movement?" Of course not. In order to adapt to the needs of the new high tide of agricultural cooperation, we must produce more, better, and cheaper farm tools. The entire factory, from leading staff to workers, took action. Leading staff and management personnel at all levels reviewed the cost and work-hour plans item by item and proposed to reduce costs by 1.5 percent on the basis of the fourth quarter plan, shorten the average work-hour quota by 5 percent, and increase production by 50 harvesters and 100 seeders.

    The workers in each workshop have formulated their own guarantee conditions in order to strive to complete and overfulfill the newly set production plan. Many of these guarantee conditions have already begun to be realized. In the foundry workshop, most of the workers are actively learning Ke Maowa's advanced experience. Ke Maowa is responsible for producing parts for large agricultural implements. In this workshop, the production of each part requires the use of more than seven kinds of tools. If each foundry worker produces 300 parts for double-wheel double-share plows per day, that is 300 uses of these seven kinds of tools. Other foundry workers did not put the tools in a fixed place, but looked for them when they needed them, wasting a lot of time looking for tools. Ke Maowa arranged the tools according to the order of production, so that they could be taken at hand when needed and put back in place after use. In this way, he produced each part one minute faster than others, and the total output was always about 10 percent higher than others, and the quality was also better. However, in the beginning, his experience did not attract the attention of others. Because in the impression of others, Ke Maowa was only a third-grade worker who had just completed his apprenticeship. According to the veteran workers, he was still a "greenhorn." Later, everyone realized that only by learning from his experience could they increase output and improve quality. As a result, new achievements appeared. In October, the daily output of ten kinds of parts for double-wheel double-share plows and seeders exceeded the factory's highest record. For example, the "plow bottom" on the double-wheel double-share plow, which used to be produced by a maximum of 79 per person per day, can now be produced at 120 per day. The "seed-blocking disc" on the seeder, which used to be produced by a maximum of 400 per person per day, can now produce 970. The foundry workshop, based on the suggestion of technician Cao Yu, modified the open-hearth furnace, and the output increased by about one time.

    In the machine shop, the workers also came up with ways to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Xu Hongji was originally doing adjusting nut work, but recently he was transferred to the tool room because the tool supply could not keep up. In the beginning, he could only sharpen a dozen knives a day, which could not meet the production needs. He thought: How can we produce more agricultural machines and support the agricultural cooperation movement if we continue like this? Therefore, he worked hard to study and improve the operation method, and now he can sharpen 60 knives a day, and he can also save 40 to 50 yuan worth of tool materials every month. Mechanic Zhu Wenying improved the operation method of adjusting the lead screw, and two people completed the workload of three people in one month. Workers in the fitter, forging and other workshops also came up with many ways to increase production. For example, the electric welding team in the fitter workshop used to weld seed delivery hoppers on the seeder one by one, and one welding rod could only weld six hoppers. Li Yongxing suggested welding the seed delivery hoppers together, which reduced the time for striking a fire each time a weld was made, and each welding rod could weld 14 hoppers.

    In the production to support the agricultural cooperation movement, many workers who were previously not active enough or even backward have also become active. For example, foundry worker Li Yuwan had always failed to complete the production plan in the past. Since reading Chairman Mao's report, he has become active in production. The parts he produces for the gate valve seat have increased from 320 per day to 450. Veteran fitter Cao Guangyan reviewed his past thought of being impatient when teaching apprentices and guaranteed that he would patiently teach his skills to his apprentices in the future. Because he knew that to support the agricultural cooperation movement, everyone must work hard, and apprentices cannot do a good job if they do not master the technology.

    In October, all the workers of the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory overproduced 130 double-wheel double-share plows. Now they are working hard to overfulfill the production tasks for the fourth quarter and are preparing for reducing costs and trial-producing new products next year. They plan to reduce the cost of each double-wheel double-share plow by another 23 yuan next year and start producing cotton seeders.

　　为农民生产更多、更好、更便宜的农具
　　李茜
    在西安农业机械制造厂里，职工们正以自己的劳动来支援农业合作化运动。
    西安农业机械厂今年才开始生产双轮双铧犁、十二行播种机和马拉割麦机等大型农具。在开始的时候，工人掌握不了操作技术，生产出的产品不合规格。职工们就组织“技术研究会”、“废品评议会”，努力学习兄弟厂的先进生产经验，提高自己的技术，从而在第三季度就超额完成了国家计划。八月份成本跟二月份比较，每部双轮双铧犁降低了十七元，每部十二行播种机的成本降低八十元；每部马拉割麦机成本降低一百五十元。第三季度的废品率比第一季度减少了百分之十八点六。
    毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中共中央关于农业合作化问题的决议的发表，更加鼓舞了西安农业机械厂的职工。他们问自己：“农业的社会主义改造的高潮就要到来了，作为生产农业生产资料的工人，能够站在这个运动的外面吗？”当然不能。为了适应农业合作化新高潮的需要，必须生产更多、更好、更便宜的农具。全厂从领导工作人员到工人，都行动了起来。各级领导工作人员和管理人员逐项审查了成本和工时计划，提出了在第四季度计划的基础上，降低成本百分之一点五，平均缩短工时定额百分之五，增产五十部收割机和一百部播种机。
    各车间的工人都制定了自己的保证条件，以便争取完成和超额完成新订出的生产计划。这些保证条件有很多已经开始实现了。在铸工车间里，绝大部分工人都在积极学习科毛娃的先进经验。科毛娃负责生产大型农具的零件。在这个车间里，生产每一个零件都需要用七种以上的工具，如果每个铸工每天生产三百个双轮双铧犁上的零件，那就三百次使用这七种工具。别的铸工没把工具放在固定的地方，现用现找，很多时间都浪费在找工具上了。科毛娃根据生产的次序，把工具排列起来，用时随手可以拿到，用完再放回原处。这样，他每生产一个零件就比别人快一分钟，总产量总是比别人高百分之十左右，质量也比较好。但是，开始的时候，他的经验没有引起别人的注意。因为在别人的印象里，科毛娃只是一个刚刚出师的三级工人，按老师傅们的说法，他还是个毛娃娃哩。后来，大家认识到，只有学习他的经验才能增加产量和提高质量。于是，新的成就出现了。在十月份，就有十种双轮双铧犁和播种机上的零件的日产量超过了这个厂的最高纪录。如双轮双铧犁上的“犁床”，过去每人每天最多生产七十九个，现在每天可以生产一百二十个。播种机上的“堵种盘”，过去每人每天最多生产四百个，现在能生产九百七十个。铸工车间根据技术员曹愚的建议改装了马钢炉，产量提高了一倍左右。
    在机工车间里，工人们也想出了提前完成计划的办法。许鸿基本来是做调节丝母工作的，最近因为刀具供应不上，才被调到刀具室工作。开始的时候，他每天只能磨十几把刀，不能满足生产需要。他想：这样下去怎么能多生产农业机器，支援农业合作化运动呢？于是，他便努力钻研，改进了操作方法，现在每天可以磨六十把刀，并且每月还能节约价值四、五十元的刀具原料。机工朱文营改进了调节丝杆的操作方法，两个人用二十天的时间完成了三个人一个月的工作量。钳工、锻工等车间的工人也想出了很多增产的办法。如钳工车间电焊组过去焊播种机上的输籽漏斗，是一个一个的焊，一根焊条只能焊六个漏斗。李永兴建议把输籽漏斗排在一起焊，这样，就减少了每焊一次打一次火的时间，每根焊条可以焊十四个漏斗。
    在支援农业合作化运动的生产中，许多过去不够积极甚至落后的工人也积极起来了。如铸工李玉万过去一直完不成生产计划，自从读了毛主席的报告以后，生产积极起来了。他生产的闸肖座零件由过去日产三百二十个提高到四百五十个。钳工老师傅曹光炎检讨了过去教徒弟不耐烦的思想，保证今后一定把自己的技术耐心地教给徒弟。因为他知道了：要支援农业合作化运动，必须大家努力，徒弟不掌握技术就不能做好工作。
    十月份，西安农业机械厂的全体职工超额生产了一百三十部双轮双铧犁。现在他们一方面努力超额完成第四季度的生产任务，一方面为明年降低成本和试制新产品做准备工作。他们计划在明年把每部双轮双铧犁的成本再降低二十三元，并开始生产棉花播种机。
