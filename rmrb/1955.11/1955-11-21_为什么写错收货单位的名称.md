　　To the Editorial Board:
    When sending goods, some commercial units and factories and mines often miswrite the names of the consignees, causing difficulties for the consignee units to pick up the goods, and sometimes even subject them to fines from the railway department. For example, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Company Purchasing and Supply Station, Tianjin Pharmaceutical Company, Tianjin Chemical Company, and Jinan Xinhua Pharmaceutical Factory have all mistakenly written the name of the consignee, Chaoyang County Pharmaceutical Department, as "Chaoyang Pharmaceutical Company," so that the Pharmaceutical Department could not immediately pick up the goods after they arrived, and was also fined for overdue pickup. Furthermore, units such as the Beijing Handicraft Industry Cooperative and its affiliated Chemical Factory, Andong Needle Factory, Changchun Glass Factory, and Shanghai Record Company have mistakenly written the name of the consignee, Chaoyang Department Store Wholesale Station, as "Zhongbai Chaoyang Supply Station," "Zhongbai Chaoyang City Company," or "Zhongbai Chaoyang Purchasing and Supply Station." Among them, the Beijing Handicraft Industry Cooperative has misspelled the name of the consignee five times in a row; as a result, before Chaoyang Department Store Wholesale Station could pick up the goods, it had to first obtain a certificate from the local government department, which affected the time for the goods to be put in storage and sold.
    In order to avoid this phenomenon, the state-owned commercial units of Chaoyang County have repeatedly notified the consignors to pay attention through official documents; however, the situation has not improved. Don't these units know how much trouble their careless work style has caused to the work of the consignees?

### 为什么写错收货单位的名称

　  为什么写错收货单位的名称编辑同志：
    某些商业单位和厂矿企业在发送货物的时候，经常把收货方的名称写错，使收货单位提货的时候发生困难，有时甚至还要受到铁道部门的罚款。例如，上海医药公司采购供应站、天津医药公司、天津化工公司和济南新华药厂等单位都曾将收货方的朝阳县医药部的名称误写为“朝阳医药公司，以致货物运到以后医药部无法立即提取，并且由于过期提货还出了罚款。又如，北京手工业合作社及其所属化学厂、安东制针厂、长春玻璃厂和上海唱片公司等单位曾把收货方的朝阳百货批发站误写为
  “中百朝阳供应站”、“中百朝阳市公司”或“中百朝阳采购供应站”，其中北京市手工业合作社一连把收货方名称写错了五次；于是朝阳百货批发站提货以前，必须先到当地政府部门开具证明信，影响了商品入库和销售的时间。
    朝阳县各国营商业单位为了避免这种现象，曾经多次用公文通知发货方提起注意；但是情况并没有好转。这些单位难道不知道他们这种粗枝大叶的工作作风，已经给收货方的工作造成了多大的麻烦吗？
