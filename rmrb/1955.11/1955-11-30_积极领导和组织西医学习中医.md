    Actively Lead and Organize Western Medicine Practitioners to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine
    Chairman of the Chinese Medical Association, Fu Lianzhang
    Since 1954, when the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao once again criticized the serious errors of neglecting and discriminating against Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), and pointed out that the most important task at present is to vigorously lead and organize Western medicine practitioners to study TCM, cooperate with TCM practitioners, and research and organize the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, the vast number of health cadres across the country have gained a deeper understanding of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, have begun to criticize the erroneous ideas of neglecting and discriminating against TCM, and have begun to set off a wave of enthusiasm for studying TCM. The number of people reading and studying TCM books has increased, and the number of people apprenticing to TCM practitioners and learning from TCM has also increased. All aspects have shown an atmosphere of unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, with mutual learning.
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese Medical Association has done some work to strengthen the unity of TCM and Western medicine and to organize Western medicine practitioners to learn from TCM. For example, in 1953, the Academic Exchange Committee of TCM and Western Medicine was officially established to carry out academic exchanges; TCM practitioners were invited to participate in the academic seminars organized by the Chinese Medical Association. In early 1954, TCM forums were organized, and TCM practitioners were regularly invited to give academic reports. Medical journals paid attention to publishing articles related to TCM. After studying the central instructions, the enthusiasm of the broad membership for learning TCM increased. The Chinese Medical Association promptly organized seminars on how to study TCM and how to read TCM books, and, together with relevant parties, prepared to organize study classes for Western medicine practitioners to study TCM, mobilizing and organizing Western medicine practitioners to systematically read TCM books and comprehensively study traditional Chinese medicine.
    Thanks to the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the attention of health administrative leading organs at all levels, and the efforts of the broad masses of comrades, in the past year, the work of strengthening the unity of TCM and Western medicine and organizing Western medicine practitioners to learn from TCM has achieved some initial gains. The vast number of health cadres have undergone a relatively profound change in their understanding of TCM. Under the guidance of the Party and Chairman Mao, the vast number of health cadres have enhanced their understanding and criticized erroneous ideas through the study and discussion of documents. For example, many Western medicine practitioners have said that in the past, when they heard that TCM had cured certain diseases, they would say that these diseases would have gotten better even without treatment, which was a statement based on prejudice. More people examined and criticized the fact that their previous opposition to TCM was blind, echoing others, and echoing that TCM talked about yin and yang and the five elements, which was unscientific, but they really did not understand how TCM worked. The criticism of these ideas undoubtedly has a great positive effect on strengthening the unity of TCM and Western medicine and learning from TCM.
    Due to increased understanding, the number of cases of Western medicine practitioners cooperating with TCM practitioners, learning from TCM, and TCM and Western medicine jointly researching and treating diseases has greatly increased, and some preliminary results have been achieved. For example, TCM and Western medicine have cooperated to jointly study the use of TCM piles powder to treat hemorrhoids, and the use of TCM Qingwen Baidu Decoction and Baihu Decoction, Angong Niuhuang Pills, etc. to treat type B encephalitis, and have achieved good results; acupuncture and moxibustion have been used to treat tonsillitis, TCM Rehmannia Mixture to treat diabetes, TCM Artemisia scoparia to treat hepatitis, and TCM Coptis chinensis to treat pertussis, all of which have achieved preliminary results. The achievement of these results can be said to be the harvest of mutual unity and cooperation between TCM and Western medicine, which powerfully proves the correctness of the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao.
    The atmosphere of Western medicine practitioners reading and studying TCM books has gradually become stronger. Many Western medicine practitioners have begun to actively read TCM books, including many experts and professors. The TCM study class for Western medicine practitioners run by the Chinese Medical Association has been enthusiastically attended, with a full learning atmosphere. Most of the groups have held after-class discussions, and some doctors have also written learning experiences. Through study, many people feel that their understanding of TCM has greatly changed; they feel that traditional Chinese medicine has a very rich content, and some students have a preliminary understanding of TCM.
    The vast number of cadres in the health department are enthusiastically responding to the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the enthusiasm for learning is constantly rising, and learning will become more in-depth. However, there are still some problems in learning. First of all, the purpose of learning is not clear enough in the minds of some comrades. The lack of clarity in understanding is mainly manifested in not regarding learning TCM as a problem of researching and organizing the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, so the consciousness of learning is not enough. We know that TCM has a history of thousands of years in China and is an important part of the motherland's culture. Almost all of our rural residents and more than half of our urban residents still rely on TCM for medical treatment. In the past 100 years, Western medicine has been imported, which has improved our level of medical science and solved the treatment and prevention of many diseases, but it is a foreign thing in our country, which is not connected with the development of our TCM, and has not been integrated. We have not been good at accepting foreign things on our own foundation, and enriching and improving our original things in absorbing foreign culture. The purpose of our learning TCM is to learn and organize the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine, and to improve and promote it with today's scientific knowledge. The completion of this task requires close cooperation and joint efforts between TCM and Western medicine, especially the active participation of Western medicine practitioners with modern scientific knowledge. Only in this way can our inherent medical knowledge be developed and raised to the modern scientific level. This is the purpose of the Party's call for us to learn TCM.
    Secondly, there is a restless mood in learning, wanting to simply learn a few treatment methods and quickly learn how to take pulses and prescribe prescriptions. This idea is because TCM is seen as too simple. This method of learning is most likely to be piecemeal, knowing what it is but not why it is, and it is impossible to talk about research and improvement. Learning TCM is a long-term process, and it must take a long time to learn well. To research and organize the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine requires an even longer time. Therefore, the restless mood must be overcome. Learning is voluntary, but if you want to learn, you must have a long-term plan, learn to the end, do not give up halfway, and systematically and comprehensively learn step by step.
    Thirdly, the study of TCM theory is not valued. Reading TCM books and systematically studying TCM theory is an important study. We learn TCM not only to learn TCM single prescriptions and simple prescription drugs, but also to learn TCM theory, comprehensively and deeply study TCM academics, so as to take its essence and discard its dross. Therefore, it is impossible not to read TCM books. At present, it is often heard that TCM books are difficult to read. Because TCM books are difficult to understand due to their difficult language, it is much more difficult to study TCM theory than to study a specific clinical treatment method or prescribe a prescription, but it is not as difficult as it is said.
    In learning, some people have adopted the practice of rigidly comparing TCM and Western medicine, requiring that TCM things be applied to Western medicine. It is natural to have this requirement, but in reality it is difficult to do so, and it should generally not be done. Because TCM classifies diseases according to syndromes, a certain part mentioned by TCM may not be the certain part referred to by Western medicine, and a certain disease name mentioned by TCM may not be the disease referred to by Western medicine under the same disease name. A rigid approach will cause errors.
    Learning TCM requires a humble and cautious attitude and eliminating all prejudices. TCM has a long history in our country and is an extremely rich accumulation of our people's thousands of years of fighting against diseases, although there are indeed many unreasonable parts in it. Due to the limitations of its historical conditions on some issues, not all of them can conform to modern scientific explanations and have modern scientific value, but without serious study, there is no way to talk about scientific organization, and it is difficult to distinguish between essence and dross before modern scientific organization. Therefore, when learning, do not make premature criticisms, and should first accept it, and then slowly study it in learning. Some problems in TCM clinics cannot be explained all at once, and do not say that it is unscientific and doubt its role because it cannot be explained. Because there are TCM clinics that have cured diseases but cannot explain the reasons, being able to see diseases and study problems together with TCM, some problems that cannot be given scientific explanations may be solved, and academic knowledge can be improved a step. There are also difficulties in explaining the problems. Many TCM practitioners have rich clinical experience, but are not good at systematically explaining or cannot explain. We should listen to what is said, find more reference books, study more with others, and slowly and repeatedly experience it. We cannot simply use the practice of regular schools to require TCM teachers. Of course, a diligent and studious learning attitude is also important. With the correct learning attitude, willingness to work hard, and learning step by step, we will definitely learn well.
    Recently, the Ministry of Health decided to launch and organize large-scale learning among the broad masses of health cadres throughout the country, in coordination with the ideological criticism of Comrade He Cheng. This is very correct and should not be delayed, and we must actively do it.
    Responding to the call of the Party and launching and organizing the vast number of health cadres to learn TCM is the responsibility of every member of the Chinese Medical Association. We must take on this task. It is hoped that the local branches of the Chinese Medical Association will actively mobilize more members to participate in this study.

    积极领导和组织西医学习中医
    中华医学会理事长　傅连暲
    自从一九五四年党中央和毛主席再次批评了轻视、歧视中医的严重错误，指出当前最重要的事情，是大力领导和组织西医学习中医，同中医合作，研究并整理祖国医学遗产以后，全国范围内广大的卫生干部对祖国医学遗产有了进一步的认识，对轻视、歧视中医的错误思想开始进行批判，并且开始掀起学习中医的热潮。阅读研究中医书籍的人增多了，拜中医为师向中医学习的人也增多了，各方面都表现了中、西医团结合作，互相学习的气氛。
    中华医学会在党的领导下，曾经作了一些加强中西医团结，组织西医向中医学习的工作。如一九五三年正式成立了中西医学术交流委员会，开展学术交流；中华医学会组织的学术座谈会都邀请中医参加。一九五四年初，又组织了中医座谈，定期请中医做学术报告。医学杂志注意刊登有关中医药的文章。学习中央指示后，广大会员学习中医的情绪增高，中华医学会及时组织了如何学习中医、如何读中医书的座谈会，并同有关方面筹备组织了西医学习中医的学习班，发动和组织西医有系统地阅读中医书籍，全面研究祖国医学。
    由于党中央和毛主席的领导，各级卫生行政领导机关的重视，广大同志的努力，一年以来，加强中西医团结，组织西医向中医学习的工作，已有了一些初步的收获。广大卫生干部对中医的认识有了较深刻的转变。广大卫生干部在党和毛主席的教导下，通过对文件的学习、讨论，提高了认识，批判了错误的思想。例如：很多西医都说，过去听说中医治好了某些病的时候，就说这些病不治也会好，这是从成见出发的说法。更多的人检查批判了以往对中医的反对是盲目的，人云亦云的，随声附和地说中医讲阴阳五行，不科学，但是中医究竟怎样，实在并不懂。这些思想的批判，对于加强中西医团结和向中医学习，无疑地有着很大的积极作用。
    由于认识提高，西医同中医合作，向中医学习，中西医共同研究和治疗疾病的事例大大增加了，并且初步取得了一些成绩。如中西医合作共同研究用中药枯痔散治疗痔核，用中药清瘟败毒饮和白虎汤、安宫牛黄丸等治疗乙型脑炎，都已取得了较好的成绩；用针灸治疗扁桃腺炎，用中药地黄合剂治疗糖尿病，用中药茵陈蒿治疗肝炎，以及用中药黄连治疗百日咳等也都取得了初步的成绩。这些成绩的获得，可以说是中西医互相团结合作的收获，有力地证明党中央和毛主席指示的正确性。
    西医阅读、研究中医书籍的空气逐渐浓厚了。不少西医开始积极阅读中医书籍，其中包括不少专家、教授。中华医学会所办的西医学习中医的学习班，参加学习的人非常踊跃，学习情绪饱满，大多数的小组都作了课后讨论，一部分医生还写了学习心得。通过学习，许多人都觉得对中医的认识有了很大改变；觉得祖国医学是有很丰富内容的，一些学员对中医学术有了初步的了解。
    卫生部门中的广大干部对中央和毛主席的指示是热烈响应的，学习的积极性正在不断高涨，学习将更走向深入。但是在学习中也还存在着一些问题。首先，学习的目的性在一些同志的思想上还不够很明确。认识的不明确，主要表现在没有把学习中医看成是研究、整理祖国医学遗产的问题，因而学习的自觉性还不够。我们知道，中医在中国有几千年的历史，是祖国文化的重要部分，我们几乎全部农村居民和一半以上城市居民至今依靠中医治病。近百年来输入了西洋医学，使我们的医学科学水平提高了一步，解决了我们许多疾病的治疗和预防问题，但是它在我国则是外来的东西，同我国中医的发展是不相衔接的，还没有融合起来。我们还没有在学习接受外来的西洋医学的同时把我们的中医医学发扬光大，因此就形成了中西医的脱节。我们应该善于在自己的基础上接受外来的东西，在吸收外来的文化中丰富和提高自己原有的东西。我们学习中医的目的，就是学习和整理祖国医学的遗产，用今天的科学知识来提高它，发扬它。这一任务的完成，需要中西医的密切合作，共同努力，特别需要具有现代科学知识的西医积极参加。只有这样才能使我国固有的医药知识得到发展，并提高到现代的科学水平。这就是党所以号召我们学习中医的目的。
    其次，学习中有急躁情绪，想单纯学习几个治疗方法，一下子就学会按脉开方。这种想法是由于把中医学术看得太简单了。这种学法最容易断章取义，知其然而不知其所以然，根本谈不到什么研究和提高。学习中医是一个长期的过程，必须有一个较长的时间才能学好，要想研究和整理祖国医学，就需要一个更长的时间，因此，急躁情绪必须克服。学习是自愿的，但要学的话就得有一个长期的打算，学习到底，不要半途而废，并且要有系统地全面地一步步学下去。
    再次，不重视中医理论学习。读中医书，系统学习中医理论，是一个重要的学习。我们学习中医不仅要学习中医单方，简单的开方用药，而且要学习中医理论，全面深刻地研究中医学术，从而取其精华，去其糟粕。因此，不读中医书是不行的。目前常常听到说中医书难读。中医书因文字艰深，一些地方难理解其含义，学习中医理论比学习一个具体的临床疗法、开方用药要困难得多，但是，也并不像所说的那样难。
    在学习中，有些人采用了中、西医硬套硬比的作法，要求把中医的东西套在西医上。有这种要求也是很自然的，但是实际上很难这样作，一般也不应该这样作。因为中医讲病是按症候分类的，中医所说的某部分不一定就是西医所指的某部分，中医所说的某一病名，不一定就是西医同类病名所指的疾病，硬套的作法会造成错误。
    学习中医要有谦虚谨慎的态度，排除一切偏见。中医中药在我国已有悠久的历史，是我国人民几千年来同疾病作斗争的极为丰富的经验的积累，虽然其中也确有不少不合理的部分。由于在一些问题上受其历史条件的限制，不能都符合现代科学的解释，都有现代科学的价值，但是未经认真的学习就谈不到科学的整理，而未经现代科学整理之前是很难分别精华和糟粕的。因此在学习的时候，不要做过早的批判，应当先接受过来，以后在学习中再慢慢地去研究它。中医临床上有一些问题不能一下子讲出道理来，也不要因为讲不出道理来，就说是不科学，就怀疑其作用。因为中医临床上有治好了病而讲不出道理的，能和中医在一起看病，一道研究问题，一些不能作出科学解释的问题，或可能得到解决，就能把学术提高一步。在讲解的问题上也有困难。有很多中医有丰富的临床经验，但是不善于系统地讲解，或讲解不出。我们就应该讲什么听什么，多找些参考书，多同别人研究，慢慢地反复地体会，不能简单地用正规学校的作法来要求中医老师。当然刻苦钻研的学习态度也是重要的，有了正确的学习态度，肯努力，一步步地学习下去，就一定学得好。
    最近卫生部决定在全国范围内，在广大卫生干部中，配合对贺诚同志的思想批判，发动和组织大规模的学习。这是非常正确的，也是不应迟缓的，我们必须积极去做。
    响应党的号召，发动和组织广大卫生干部学习中医，中华医学会的每一个会员都有责任，我们一定要把这个任务担当起来。希望中华医学会各地分会，积极发动更多的会员参加这一学习。
