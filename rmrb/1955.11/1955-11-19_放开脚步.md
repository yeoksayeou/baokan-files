When Jiangxi Township in Fengyi County, Yunnan Province, conducted its overall township planning, the township cadres originally only planned to reclaim 200 mu of wasteland. When the masses discussed it, everyone disagreed. Some said, "You cadres aren't calculating carefully enough. Of the 40-plus cattle, 28 can be used for reclamation. If each head is calculated at one mu per day, how much will be reclaimed in a month?" As a result, they had to change 200 mu to 600 mu. The agricultural production cooperative in Sanshao Township also originally planned to reclaim just over 200 mu, but as a result reclaimed over 700 mu in one month. In the plan, they wanted to buy horse carts and build ox carts, but the cooperative cadres emphasized the difficulty in obtaining funds. After the masses accepted the plan, they raised more than 1,800 yuan in a few days. So the cooperative cadres had to examine themselves and say, "We are walking like bound-footed women; we just can't take big steps."

In the agricultural cooperation movement and other tasks, there are still many workers who cannot see far ahead and do not understand the demands and changes of the masses. If we do not advance quickly, we will fall behind the tide.

　　放开脚步
    云南省凤仪县江西乡进行乡的全面规划时，原来乡干部在规划中只准备开荒二百亩，群众讨论时，大家都不同意。有的说：“你们干部也不仔细算一算，四十多头牛，可以用在开荒的就有二十八头，每头一天就按一亩算，一个月要开多少？”结果只好把二百亩改为六百亩。三哨乡的农业生产合作社，原计划也是开荒二百多亩，结果一个月就开了七百多亩。规划中要买马车，打牛车，社干部强调资金困难，群众接受规划后，几天就凑集了一千八百多元。于是社干部只好检讨说：“我们是小脚婆娘走路，就是迈不开步子。”
    在农业合作化运动以及其他各项工作中，还有很多工作人员眼睛看不到远处，也不知道群众的要求和变化。如不赶快前进，就要落在潮流的后面了。
