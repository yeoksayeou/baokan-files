Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 6 Increases Crude Oil Production

　　The production of synthetic crude oil at Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 6 is rapidly increasing. The crude oil produced in the first ten months of this year exceeded the total output of last year by more than 3,600 tons.

　　Northeast Petroleum Factory No. 6 uses coal as raw material, first manufacturing coal gas, and then using synthetic methods to produce crude oil. In order to increase the production of crude oil, the technical management personnel and workers of this factory have tried in many ways to increase the production of coal gas this year, so that the daily output of each gas furnace has increased by more than 700 cubic meters compared with the beginning of the year.

　  东北石油六厂原油产量增长
    东北石油六厂人造石油的产量迅速增长。今年前十个月生产出的原油比去年全年的产量还多三千六百多吨。
    东北石油六厂是以煤作原料，先制造出煤气，再利用合成方法生产原油。为了增加原油的产量，今年这个工厂的技术管理人员和工人从多方面设法提高煤气的产量，使每座煤气炉每天产量比年初时增加了七百多立方公尺。　（新华社）
