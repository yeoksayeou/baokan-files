Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, October 30th: According to TASS, Bulgarian Council of Ministers Chairman Chervenkov answered several questions regarding Bulgarian-British relations posed by British reporters Green and Hicks. The two British reporters were in Sofia to cover the football match between the national teams of Bulgaria and Britain.

In answering the British reporters' questions, Chervenkov said that the warm reception given to the British football team in Sofia is one expression of the Bulgarian people's and government's willingness and readiness to maintain and strengthen friendly ties with Britain and the British people. To achieve these goals, I believe that mutual visits by representatives of the scientific, artistic, and sporting circles of both countries, as well as social and political activists, are some good measures that can be taken. These measures should be encouraged to develop and strengthen friendly ties between the two countries.

Chervenkov said that the trade agreement concluded between Bulgaria and Britain this year is a significant measure beneficial to both countries. There is no reason not to continue taking new measures in this direction. Everything that helps to improve relations between Bulgaria and Britain on the basis of mutual benefit, equality, and trust will always receive the support and sincere welcome of the Bulgarian government.

    契尔文科夫就保英两国关系答英国记者问
    新华社三十一日讯　据塔斯社索非亚三十日讯：保加利亚部长会议主席契尔文科夫，对英国记者格林和希克斯所提出的有关保英两国的一些问题作了答复。这两个英国记者是到索非亚采访保英两国国家足球队比赛的消息的。
    在回答英国记者的问题时，契尔文科夫说，英国足球队在索非亚受到亲切的接待，是保加利亚人民和政府愿意并且准备维持和加强同英国和英国人民的友好联系的表现之一。为要达到这些目的，我认为两国科学、艺术、体育界的代表，社会和政治活动家的互相访问，就是一些可以采取的很好的措施。要发展和加强两国间的友好联系，这些措施是应当受到鼓励的。
    契尔文科夫说，保加利亚和英国之间今年所缔结的贸易协定是有利于两国的重大措施。没有理由不朝着这个方向继续采取新的措施。凡是有助于在互利、平等和信任的基础上改善保英两国之间的关系的一切，将会始终得到保加利亚政府的支持和真诚的欢迎。
