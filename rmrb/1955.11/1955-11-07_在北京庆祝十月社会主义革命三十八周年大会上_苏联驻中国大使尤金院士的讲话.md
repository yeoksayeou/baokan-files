Comrade Chairman! Dear Comrades and Friends!

The Soviet people are celebrating the 38th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution with great excitement and joy. The people of the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries, as well as all progressive mankind, share this festive joy of the Soviet people.

Thirty-eight years ago, the Russian working class, under the leadership of the Communist Party headed by the great Lenin, realized the socialist revolution for the first time in human history, liberating the Russian working people from the regime of capitalists and landlords, and creating the world's first socialist state. Over the past thirty-eight years, the Soviet people have traveled a heroic and arduous road. The Soviet people had to pioneer the road to socialism for the first time. Every step forward on this road is a historically significant new creation.

The Soviet state was once surrounded by hostile capitalist countries, which used military intervention, economic blockade, espionage and provocation in various ways to carry out countless obstructions and sabotage against us, but we finally overcame all difficulties and became victors after numerous struggles.

The Soviet people will never forget the great and valuable support given to us by the world working class and progressive people in the past and present.

On this festive day that makes us all rejoice, we express our fraternal gratitude to the Chinese working class and working people and to the working people all over the world for their great support for the victory of Soviet socialist construction.

Now, the Soviet people are living in an atmosphere of boiling creative labor, striving to build a communist society. The Soviet people are greeting the great festival with new achievements on all fronts of peaceful construction. A more magnificent future lies ahead of us. Our goal is to build communism! The Soviet people are looking forward to their tomorrow with full confidence, because the Communist Party, which has been tested and tempered, is leading our people forward.

The tasks of the Fifth Five-Year Plan in terms of total industrial production have been completed ahead of schedule in four years and four months. The industrial production level this year will be more than double that of the pre-war year of 1940. In 1955, the Soviet Union will produce more than 33 million tons of pig iron, about 45 million tons of steel, and extract more than 390 million tons of coal and 70 million tons of oil. Electricity production this year will reach 166 billion kilowatt-hours. Many new and huge power stations have begun production. Not long ago, the Narva, Kama, Kakhovka and Gorky hydroelectric power stations generated their first batch of industrial electricity. The construction of the Kuibyshev hydroelectric power station and many other hydroelectric power stations is nearing completion.

On the eve of the October Revolution, Russia was on the verge of a huge national disaster, but now the Soviet Union has become the world's greatest socialist power, its industry and agriculture being equipped with advanced modern technology. To judge how big a step socialist Russia has taken forward, the following facts can be used to illustrate: In 1954, the total output value of Soviet large-scale industry increased 35 times compared with 1913, the production of means of production increased 60 times, electricity production increased 75 times, and the production of machinery manufacturing increased 150 times.

In modern history, there is no faster rate of economic development than that of the Soviet Union.

Soviet scientists, engineers and technicians have solved the world's largest problem for the first time - the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The Soviet atomic power station has been generating electricity for nearly two years now.

This is where the great significance of the socialist revolution lies. At the same time, this also proves that socialism is a much more progressive mode of production than capitalism.

Socialism is a social system where there are no landlords, exploiters, and all other parasites who live off the labor of others.

All the achievements of science, culture, technology and industrial and agricultural production are only used to create happiness for the working people and for all the people. This is the highest law of socialism.

The July Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union formulated a far-reaching plan to further improve socialist industry, and once again declared that the Communist Party's general line of giving priority to the development of heavy industry is unshakable.

The Communist Party and the Soviet government tirelessly care for the further development of socialist agriculture. The Soviet Union has launched a huge work of reclaiming virgin and fallow land, and has taken various measures to increase crop yields and livestock product output. Socialist agriculture is receiving more and more tractors, combine harvesters and other machines every year. Soviet agricultural workers are resolutely fighting for the annual harvest of 10 billion poods of grain. The past year was a significant milestone on the road to this goal.

On the basis of the continuous growth of industrial and agricultural production in the whole society, the material well-being and cultural level of the Soviet working people are increasing year by year, and their growing needs are being met more and more fully. The vigorous prosperity of the cultures of all nationalities in the Soviet Union is a remarkable sign of the great achievements of the October Revolution. The Soviet Union has changed from a country where most of its inhabitants were illiterate in the era of Tsarist Russia into a country where the people are universally literate and have a high level of culture.

The banner of the October Revolution is the banner of peace and friendship among all peoples.

From the very beginning of the establishment of Soviet power, our Party has been a defender of peace and a defender of the development of cooperative relations between the people of all countries in the world. If the young Soviet state, which issued the historically significant Decree on Peace as its first decree, had to defend peace alone at that time, then now, together with the Soviet Union, the great People's Republic of China, which is holding the banner of peace, democracy and socialism, and the people's democratic countries that have forever abandoned capitalism and embarked on the road of socialist construction, are holding the same banner.

The Soviet Union's recent persistent efforts to ease the international situation are conclusive evidence of the Soviet Union's love of peace. The Soviet Union's substantial reduction of its armed forces, its improvement of friendly relations with Yugoslavia, the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany, the conclusion of a treaty on bilateral relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, and the Soviet Union's return of the naval base of Porkkala-Udd to Finland - these are only some of the practical steps taken by the Soviet Union in this direction. These steps by the Soviet government are conducive to creating an atmosphere of international trust, have been warmly praised by world public opinion, and are a valuable contribution to the cause of peace.

The immortal ideas of October are not only growing and winning in the Soviet Union. It has an increasing influence on the fate of all nations in the world. The working people of the people's democratic countries have embarked on the road of socialist construction. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is consolidating year by year.

Under the leadership of the long-tested Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people are fighting to realize their first Five-Year Plan, and their achievements have worldwide historical significance for the cause of democracy and socialism. The first three years of the Five-Year Plan have marked great victories in all sectors of the national economy.

The recent Resolution on the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization adopted by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China based on Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant instruction to lead 500 million Chinese peasants onto the socialist road will be of tremendous significance to the Chinese peasants and the entire Chinese people.

The victorious advance of the Chinese people on the road to socialism is being carried out under the sign of constantly consolidating and further developing the unbreakable friendship with the Soviet people. This friendship is permanent and unbreakable because it is based on the complete identity of interests of the Soviet and Chinese peoples and embodies the ardent desire of the two peoples. The friendship between the Soviet Union and People's China is vividly creative, helping the two peoples to enrich each other and promote their economic and cultural development at a rapid pace.

The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples is a huge positive force for maintaining world peace, and it is having an increasing influence on the entire course of historical events today.

The People's Republic of China has become an important factor in international development and progress. It is now clear to everyone that international issues in the world, especially in the Far East, cannot be resolved without the participation of the People's Republic of China. This is a truth that every sane person understands, but the authorities in certain bourgeois countries simply ignore it. As a result of their brutal suppression, the Tenth Session of the United Nations General Assembly has once again postponed the resolution of the issue of restoring the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. But no one can change the fact that the great People's China exists, and China has now firmly occupied its due position as a great power on the international stage.

China's growing role was particularly evident at the Bandung Conference held this spring, attended by representatives from 29 Asian and African countries. Recently, the Chinese government has taken a series of new steps aimed at consolidating peace in Asia and the world. The People's Republic of China's proposal to hold direct negotiations with the United States in order to ease the tension in the Taiwan region and resolve other disputes between China and the United States is conclusive evidence of the People's Republic of China's desire for peace. The proposal put forward by the People's Republic of China to conclude a collective peace pact among Asian and Pacific countries has received widespread support from all peace-loving people. This pact can be joined by the United States and can replace the hostile military blocs that exist in this region of the earth.

The Soviet people warmly hope that the Chinese people will achieve success in implementing a peaceful policy, hope that the Chinese people will realize their sovereignty over Taiwan, and believe that the Chinese people's just cause will surely win.

The people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and the people's democratic countries, who are united in unbreakable brotherhood, are marching forward along the road of prosperity and progress, the road of consolidating friendship and peaceful cooperation with all countries, and the road of maintaining and consolidating world peace.

Long live the 38th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution!

Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples, a powerful factor for world peace, and its ever-increasing prosperity!

### 在北京庆祝十月社会主义革命三十八周年大会上  苏联驻中国大使尤金院士的讲话

    在北京庆祝十月社会主义革命三十八周年大会上
    苏联驻中国大使尤金院士的讲话主席同志！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    苏联人民正以万分兴奋愉快的心情庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年。中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的人民以及全体进步人类，都分享着苏联人民的这种节日的欢欣。
    三十八年以前，俄国工人阶级在以伟大的列宁为首的共产党的领导下，在人类历史上第一次实现了社会主义革命，使俄国劳动人民从资本家和地主政权下获得解放，创立了世界上第一个社会主义国家。三十八年来苏联人民走过了一段英雄的、艰巨的道路。苏联人民曾经不得不第一次去开辟通向社会主义的道路。在这条道路上的每一步进展都是具有历史意义的新创造。
    苏维埃国家曾经处在敌对的资本主义国家的包围之中，这些国家用军事干涉、经济封锁、间谍和挑衅等各种方式对我们进行过数不清的阻挠和破坏，但我们终于克服了一切困难，经过重重斗争而成为胜利者。
    苏联人民永远也不会忘记世界工人阶级和进步人士在过去和现在所给予我们的伟大而宝贵的支援。
    在这个使我们大家欢欣鼓舞的节日里，我们对中国工人阶级和劳动人民以及全世界劳动人民对苏联社会主义建设取得胜利所给予的伟大支援，表示我们的兄弟的感谢。
    现在，苏联人民生活在沸腾的创造劳动的气氛中，努力建设共产主义社会。苏联人民正以和平建设各个战线上的新成就来迎接伟大的节日。摆在我们前面的是更加壮丽的前途。我们的目的是建成共产主义！苏联人民满怀信心地瞻望着自己的明天，因为，领导我们人民前进的是久经考验和百炼成钢的共产党。
    第五个五年计划在工业生产总量方面的任务已经在四年零四个月时间中提前完成了。今年的工业生产水平增为战前一九四○年的两倍以上。在一九五五年，苏联将生产三千三百多万吨生铁，约四千五百万吨钢，开采三亿九千多万吨煤和七千万吨石油。电力生产在今年将达到一千六百六十亿瓩时。许多新的巨大的电力站已开始投入生产。不久前纳尔瓦、卡马、卡霍夫卡和高尔基水电站发出了第一批工业用电。古比雪夫水电站和许多别的水电站的建设工程即将完成。
    在十月革命前夕，俄国濒于巨大的民族的灾难，而现在苏联已经变成了世界上最伟大的社会主义强国，它的工业和农业都是用先进的现代技术装备起来的。要判断社会主义的俄国向前跨越了多么大的一步，可以用下列事实来说明：一九五四年苏联大工业总产量和一九一三年相比增加了三十五倍，生产资料的生产增加六十倍，电力生产增加七十五倍，机器制造业的生产量增加一百五十倍。
    在近代历史中，没有比苏联更快的经济发展的速度。
    苏联科学家、工程师和技术人员第一次解决了世界上最大的问题——将原子能利用于和平目的。苏联的原子能发电站发电到现在已将近有两年了。
    社会主义革命的伟大意义就在这里。同时，这也证明社会主义是比资本主义更要进步得多的生产方式。
    社会主义是这样的一种社会制度，这里没有地主、剥削者和靠别人的劳动过活的其他一切寄生虫。
    科学、文化、技术和工农业生产的一切成就，都只用来为劳动人民、为全体人民创造幸福。这是社会主义的最高法则。
    苏联共产党中央委员会七月全会制定了进一步提高社会主义工业的远大计划，并再一次宣告共产党的优先发展重工业的总路线是不可动摇的。
    共产党和苏联政府不倦地关怀着社会主义农业的进一步发展。苏联国内展开了开垦生荒地和熟荒地的巨大工作，并采取各种措施来提高农作物收获量和畜产品产量。社会主义农业逐年获得越来越多的拖拉机、联合收割机和其他各种机器。苏联农业劳动者正在坚决地为每年收获一百亿普特谷物而斗争。过去的一年是走向这个目的的道路上的一个显著的路标。
    在全社会工农业生产不断增长的基础上，苏联劳动人民的物质幸福和文化水平正在逐年提高，他们日益增长的需求得到越来越充分的满足。苏联各民族文化的蓬勃繁荣，是十月革命的伟大成果的显著标志。苏联已从沙俄时代大多数居民都是文盲的国家，变成了一个人民普遍识字并有高度文化的国家。
    十月革命的旗帜是各族人民和平和友谊的旗帜。
    从苏维埃政权开始建立的时候起，我们党就是和平的捍卫者，发展世界各国人民间的事务合作关系的捍卫者。如果说当时发布的第一个法令就是具有历史意义的和平法令的年青苏维埃国家不得不单独保卫和平的话，那末，现在和苏联一起擎着和平、民主和社会主义旗帜的已有伟大的中华人民共和国，以及永远抛弃了资本主义和走上社会主义建设道路的各人民民主国家了。
    苏联近来为着和缓国际局势所作的坚毅的努力，是苏联爱好和平的确凿的证据。苏联大量裁减军队，改善同南斯拉夫的友好关系，苏联同德意志联邦共和国建立外交关系，苏联同德意志民主共和国缔结两国关系条约，以及苏联将海军基地波卡拉—乌德交还给芬兰，——这只是苏联向着这方面努力的一些实际步骤。苏联政府的这些步骤，是有助于创造国际间的信任气氛的，是受到全世界舆论热烈赞许的，是对和平事业的宝贵贡献。
    十月的不朽的思想不但在苏联生长着和胜利着。它对于全世界各民族的命运给了日益增长的影响。人民民主国家的劳动人民已经走上社会主义建设的道路。以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的社会主义阵营正在一年比一年巩固。
    中国人民在久经考验的中国共产党的领导之下正在为着实现自己的第一个五年计划而奋斗，他们所取得的成就对于民主和社会主义事业有着全世界历史的意义。五年计划的头三年已经标志出在国民经济各部门中所取得的巨大胜利。
    中国共产党中央委员会六中全会最近根据毛泽东同志将五亿中国农民引到社会主义道路的英明指示所通过的关于农业合作化问题的决议，对于中国农民和全中国的人民将有非常巨大的意义。
    中国人民向着社会主义道路上的胜利进军，是在不断巩固和更进一步地发展同苏联人民的牢不可破的友谊的标志下进行的。这种友谊是永久的和牢不可破的，因为这种友谊是以苏中两国人民的利害完全一致为基础的，并体现着两国人民的热切愿望。苏联和人民中国的友谊具有活生生的创造性，它有助于两国人民的互相丰富和推进自己的经济和文化飞速地向前发展。
    苏中两国人民的友谊是维护世界和平的巨大的积极力量，它在今天对于历史事变的全部进程发生着日益增长的影响。
    中华人民共和国已经成了国际发展和进步的重要因素。现在大家都可以看到，全世界特别是远东的国际问题，如果没有中华人民共和国的参加就不能获得解决。这原是每一个思想健全的人都明白的真理，但是某些资产阶级国家的当权人物却偏偏不去理会。由于他们粗暴压制的结果，第十届联合国大会又把解决恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利问题延搁下来了。可是任何人也改变不了伟大人民中国存在的这一事实，现在中国在国际舞台上已经巩固地占有了自己应有的大国地位了。
    在今年春天召开的、有二十九个亚非国家代表出席的万隆会议上特别明显地表现出中国日益增长的作用。最近，中国政府采取了一系列旨在巩固亚洲及世界和平的新步骤。中华人民共和国为着缓和台湾地区紧张局势和解决中美两国之间的其他争执问题建议同美国进行直接谈判，是中华人民共和国希望和平的确凿证据。中华人民共和国所提出的缔结亚洲及太平洋区域国家集体和平公约的建议，受到了全体爱好和平人民的普遍支持，这个公约可以有美国参加，它可以代替地球上这个地区所存在的敌对性的军事集团。
    苏联人民热烈地希望中国人民在实行和平政策中获得成就，希望中国人民实现在台湾的主权，并相信中国人民的正义事业一定会获得胜利。
    牢不可破地兄弟般地团结在一起的苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家的人民，正沿着繁荣和进步的道路、同一切国家巩固友谊和和平合作的道路、维护和巩固世界和平的道路向前迈进。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年万岁！
    世界和平的强大因素——苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊与合作万岁和日益繁荣！
