The Dahuo House Reservoir project on the Hun River, intended to eradicate the water hazards of the Liao River, has fully resumed construction. Currently, the 1,367-meter-long dam across the Hun River is taking shape. The clay core wall of the northern section of the dam foundation has long been backfilled, and the wide dam body is already eight meters above the ground. The middle and southern sections of the dam foundation, which were recently excavated, are either being cleared of silt and seepage, or have already begun to expose bedrock. The Hun River water, which flowed through the middle section of the dam site in mid-October, has now been diverted to a narrow diversion channel. By the end of October, after two years of excavation, the 500-meter-long water conveyance tunnel passing through the base of the mountain at the southern end of the dam was lined. Immediately afterwards, the 600-meter-long spillway project on the mountainside at the northern end was launched.

This reservoir project, which began in November 1953, was once suspended due to technical design errors. Since resuming construction on September 1 this year, 560,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work have been completed, and the 1955 construction plan is nearing completion.

In order to quickly complete the reservoir and benefit the people with the floodwaters of the Hun River as soon as possible, large-scale winter construction will be carried out on the entire reservoir site in severe cold ranging from minus 15 degrees to 30 degrees Celsius. In the five months of this winter and next spring, 900,000 cubic meters of earth and stone work will be completed to ensure that the dam can be successfully closed after the flood season next year.

### 浑河大伙房水库工程复工

　  浑河大伙房水库工程复工
    根治辽河水害的浑河大伙房水库工程已经全面复工。目前，横跨浑河一千三百六十七公尺的拦河大坝已经初具规模。北段坝基粘土心墙早就回填完了，宽大的坝身已经露出地面八公尺。近日开挖的中段和南段坝基，有的正在清除淤泥、渗水，有的已经开始露出岩石。十月中旬还穿行在坝址中段的浑河水流，如今已被推移到一条狭长的引河里。到十月末，经过两年开凿，穿越大坝南端山底五百多公尺的输水隧洞刚被衬砌完成，在北端山腰间长达六百多公尺的溢洪道工程紧接着就破土动工了。
    这个水库从一九五三年十一月开工后，因技术设计上的错误，曾一度停工。今年九月一日复工以来，已完成了五十六万土石方工程，一九五五年的施工计划已经接近完成。
    为了把水库迅速建成，早日使浑河洪水为人民造福，整个水库工地将在零下十五度到三十度的严寒里进行大规模的冬季施工。今冬明春的五个月里，要完成九十万公方的土石工程，以保证拦河大坝能在明年汛后顺利合龙。
