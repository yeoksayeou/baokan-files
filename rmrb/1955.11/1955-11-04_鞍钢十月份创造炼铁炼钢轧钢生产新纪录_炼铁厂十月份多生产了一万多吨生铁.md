Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Anshan Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling mills have continuously set new production records several times in October. After setting a new daily pig iron production record on October 2nd, the Ironmaking Plant set a new daily pig iron production record since the start of operations on the 26th, an increase of 11% over the average daily output in September, which was already a relatively good production month this year.

The Steelmaking Plant set three new fast steelmaking records in October. The highest record was set by No. 5 open-hearth furnace on October 20th, refining a furnace of steel in 5 hours and 55 minutes, shortening the planned time by 3 hours and 35 minutes, and shortening the average smelting time by 2 hours and 10 minutes compared to April, which had the shortest smelting time since the beginning of the year. In addition, on October 11th, a new record of 100% planned steel grade production was achieved. In the past, the highest planned steel grade production rate in April was only about 88.5%. Therefore, the average daily output in October increased significantly compared to September.

Due to the good steelmaking production situation, the primary rolling mill also set three new records on October 11th, 15th, and 16th. The highest record was on the 16th, with a daily steel billet output 11% higher than the average daily output in September. The medium-sized rolling mill set a new daily output record when rolling light rails on the 19th, rolling 13.4% more than the previous highest record. The first section of the small rolling mill also set two new records for shift output and daily output in October.

The emergence of these new records is primarily due to the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Party organizations repeatedly conducting propaganda and education among employees on completing the state plan in late September and early October, examining the reasons for the poor completion of the plan, specifically analyzing the company's potential, and criticizing the conservative thinking among employees, thereby enhancing the employees' enthusiasm for production. Secondly, it is due to the employees learning and promoting new Soviet technology with the help of Soviet experts. In August and September, Soviet experts went deep into the field to guide technicians and workers in conducting systematic technical measurements and proposed measures such as "fixed furnace, fixed steel grade" and strengthening thermal engineering systems in order to reverse the poor completion of the steelmaking plant's production plan. In October, the steelmaking plant employees learned advanced operations from the Soviet worker Kolesnikov, who won the title of "National Best Steel Worker," which improved production technology.

Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 3rd: The Anshan Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking plant overfulfilled the plan and produced more than 10,000 tons of pig iron for the country in October. The ironmaking workers are continuing to launch a labor emulation campaign to increase production by 100,000 tons of pig iron for the country throughout the year.

The workers of the youth ironmaking furnace – No. 7 blast furnace – overfulfilled the state plan again in October. This year, they have already produced more than 18,000 tons of pig iron for the country, completing ahead of schedule the guarantee plan of increasing production by 17,200 tons of pig iron proposed by the youth ironmaking furnace foreman Wang Hongshun at the National Youth Socialist Construction Activists Conference.

In the labor emulation campaign centered on learning advanced Soviet ironmaking technology, the effective volume of the blast furnace occupied per ton of iron produced by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking plant in October has been reduced from 0.927 cubic meters last year to 0.814 cubic meters. This major technical and economic indicator has exceeded the level stipulated in the first Five-Year Plan.

    鞍钢十月份创造炼铁炼钢轧钢生产新纪录
    炼铁厂十月份多生产了一万多吨生铁
    新华社三日讯　鞍山钢铁公司炼铁、炼钢及轧钢工厂，十月份连续创造了几次生产新纪录。炼铁厂在十月二日创造日产生铁的新纪录后，又在二十六日创造开炉以来日产生铁的新纪录，比今年生产较好的九月份的平均日产量提高百分之十一。
    炼钢厂十月份创造了三次快速炼钢的新纪录。最高的纪录是五号平炉在十月二十日以五小时五十五分炼一炉钢，比计划时间缩短了三小时三十五分，比今年以来熔炼时间最短的四月份平均缩短了二小时十分。另外，在十月十一日创造了百分之百的按计划钢种出钢的新纪录，过去按计划钢种出钢率最高的四月份只达百分之八十八点五左右。因此，十月份平均日产量比九月份提高了很多。
    由于炼钢生产情况良好，初轧厂在十月十一日、十五日、十六日也连续创造了三次新纪录。其中以十六日的纪录为最高，日产钢胚比九月份平均日产量提高百分之十一。中型轧钢厂在十九日轧轻轨的时候所创造的日产量的新纪录比过去最高纪录多轧百分之十三点四。小型轧钢厂第一工段十月份也创造了两次班产量及日产量的新纪录。
    这些新纪录的出现，首先由于鞍山钢铁公司的中共组织在九月底、十月初反复地对职工进行了完成国家计划的宣传教育，检查了计划完成不好的原因，并具体分析了企业的潜力所在，批判了职工中的保守思想，从而提高了职工的生产积极性。其次，由于职工们在苏联专家帮助下，学习和推行了苏联的新技术。八、九月份苏联专家为了扭转炼钢厂生产计划完成不好的局面，曾深入现场，指导技术人员及工人进行系统的技术测定，并提出“定炉定钢”、加强热工制度等措施。十月份炼钢厂职工学习了荣获“国家最好的钢铁工人”称号的苏联工人科列斯尼柯夫的先进操作，提高了生产技术。
    新华社鞍山三日电　鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂在十月份超过计划为国家多生产了一万多吨生铁。炼铁工人们正在继续展开全年为国家增产十万吨生铁的劳动竞赛。
    青年炼铁炉——七号高炉的职工在十月份又超额完成了国家计划。今年他们已为国家多炼了一万八千多吨生铁，提前完成了青年炼铁炉炉长王洪顺在全国青年社会主义建设积极分子大会上所提出的增产一万七千二百吨生铁的保证计划。
    在以学习苏联先进炼铁技术为中心的劳动竞赛中，鞍钢炼铁厂在十月份每炼一吨铁所占用的高炉有效容积，已由去年零点九二七立方公尺降低到零点八一四立方公尺。这一主要技术经济指标，已超过了第一个五年计划所规定的水平。
