To the Editor:

This year, Hengyang Prefecture in Hunan Province has seen a generally good rice harvest. A few farmers have therefore become careless about conserving grain. For example, the accountant of the Xin Hong Agricultural Production Cooperative in Wuzhou Township, Dao County, held a ten-table wedding banquet on August 26th. Chen Zuhua, a farmer from Xulan Township, Hengnan, boiled more than 30 jin of rice into sweets. He Guangfeng, a middle peasant, did not have enough grain to eat last year, and the government sold him 650 jin; this year, he "forgot the pain once the sore healed," and held more than ten tables of banquet when "receiving ancestors" on the fifteenth day of the seventh lunar month, wasting more than 700 jin of grain. Yan Laoguan's daughter-in-law, a farmer in Shiqiao Township, Hengshan, fed her dog rice every meal, and when others advised her to conserve, she retorted: "If everyone eats one less mouthful, there will be enough!" In particular, the phenomenon of using rice to make sweet wine is very common. According to statistics, after the harvest of early and mid-season rice, 350 households in Daling Township, Hengnan, alone have already made sweet wine, consuming more than 10,000 jin of grain.

At present, our country's grain is not abundant, and conserving grain is an important task for the people of the whole country. "Many a little makes a mickle." We should start with small things when saving grain. The situation of farmers wasting grain after a good harvest may also exist in other regions. It is recommended that all localities pay attention to this issue and widely educate the masses of farmers on the importance of saving grain.

### 衡南等县少数农民秋收后不注意节约粮食

    衡南等县少数农民秋收后不注意节约粮食编辑同志：
    今年湖南省衡阳专区稻子普遍丰收。有少数农民因而就不注意节约粮食。例如，道县五州乡新红农业生产合作社的会计在八月二十六日结婚，就摆了十桌酒席。衡南徐兰乡农民陈祖华熬了三十多斤米的糖。中农贺光凤去年粮食不够吃，政府销给了六百五十斤；今年他“好了疮疤忘了疼”，在旧历七月半“接祖”的时候就摆了十多桌酒席，浪费粮食七百多斤。衡山石桥乡农民颜老倌的媳妇餐餐用饭喂狗，别人劝她节约，她反而说：“每人少吃一口，就有了！”特别是用大米蒸甜酒的现象非常普遍。据统计，早、中稻收割以后，仅衡南大岭乡已经有三百五十户蒸了甜酒，消耗的谷子在一万斤以上。
    目前我国粮食并不宽裕，节约粮食是全国人民的一项重要任务。“滴水流成河，粒米积成箩”。我们节约粮食应当从小处着手。农民丰收后浪费粮食的情况在其他地区可能也有，建议各地重视这个问题，广泛地向农民群众进行节约粮食的教育。
