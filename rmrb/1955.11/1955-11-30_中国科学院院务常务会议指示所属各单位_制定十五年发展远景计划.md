　　The Chinese Academy of Sciences Executive Council Directs Affiliated Units
　　Formulate Fifteen-Year Development Vision Plan
　　This News: In order to implement the "General Resolution of the Establishment of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Academic Divisions", to make scientific undertakings develop more systematically and better serve socialist construction, the Executive Council of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently passed the "Instructions on Formulating the Fifteen-Year Development Vision Plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences", requiring all research units and academic divisions affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences to begin discussing and formulating the fifteen-year (i.e., from the first five-year plan to the period of socialist society construction) development vision plan of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

　　The instructions state that, to formulate the vision plan, it is first necessary to carefully study the first five-year plan for the development of the national economy in our country, understand the requirements of national economic development for scientific work, study the current situation and trends of various sciences (domestic and international), and analyze the relationship between various scientific research and national construction practices. Estimate the country's further requirements for science from scientific foresight, find the growth points in various sciences; propose development paths and major issues that should be studied. The report by President Guo Moruo to the State Council of the Central People's Government in January 1954 and the report at the establishment conference of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in June 1955 should be used as the guiding principles for formulating the plan. When formulating the vision plan, a realistic estimate should be made of the current conditions and existing foundations in all aspects to ensure the practicality of the plan; at the same time, various favorable conditions for future development should be fully estimated, and these conditions should be utilized to give full play to various potential forces. The instructions also state that earnestly absorbing advanced international experience, especially the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, is an important factor in ensuring the rapid development of science in our country.

　　The content of the vision plan is: First, research on major scientific issues, including major issues in the national economy or scientific theory, including issues carried out by one unit alone or by several units (within and outside the academy) in cooperation, such as the investigation and research on the development and utilization of China's natural resources, the research on regional geology, and the research on dialectical logic, etc. Second, the development of disciplines, such as oceanography, inorganic chemistry, and sub-disciplines in large disciplines. Third, the development and establishment of institutions: including the development of existing institutions, which new institutions are responsible for developing, the establishment of new institutions and their basis, the conditions, regions, and times for establishment, and how to develop after establishment. Fourth, important investigation and research work, including comprehensive and professional, organized by region and organized by specialty, organized by one research unit and organized jointly by several research units inside and outside the academy. Fifth, the compilation of important scientific works and library materials. Sixth, the training of cadres. Seventh, basic construction and financial budget.

　　The instructions emphasized that the formulation of the vision plan is an extremely arduous task, and it is necessary to give full play to the wisdom and strength of the academic division members and scientists of the research institutes, and obtain the assistance of the State Planning Commission, various industrial sectors, the Higher Education Department, and various universities to do a good job. The academic divisions and research institutes should take the formulation of the vision plan as one of the central tasks at present, actively organize forces, conduct investigations and research, and carry out the work in a guided, organized, and step-by-step manner.

　　The instructions also specifically stipulated the procedures for formulating the vision plan.

    指示说，制定远景计划，首先要认真研究我国发展国民经济的第一个五年计划，了解国民经济发展对科学工作的要求，研究各门科学的现状和趋势
  （国内的和国际的），分析各项科学研究和国家建设实践的关系。从科学的预见去估计国家今后进一步对科学的要求，找出各门科学中的生长点；提出发展的途径和应该研究的重大问题。郭沫若院长在一九五四年一月给中央人民政府政务院的报告和一九五五年六月在中国科学院学部成立大会上的报告，应作为制定规划的方针。制定远景计划时，应对当前各方面的条件和已有的基础作切实的估计，保证计划的现实性；同时也要充分估计今后发展的各种有利条件，并善于利用这些条件，发挥各种潜在力量。指示又说，认真吸收国际先进经验，首先是苏联的先进经验，是保证我国科学迅速发展的重要因素。
    远景计划的内容是：第一、重大科学问题的研究，包括国民经济上或科学理论上的重大问题，包括一个单位单独进行的或几个单位（院内的院外的）合作进行的问题，如中国自然资源开发利用的调查研究，区域地质的研究，以及辩证逻辑的研究等。第二、学科的发展，如海洋学、无机化学以及大的学科中的分枝学科。第三、机构的发展和设置：包括现有机构的发展，现有机构负责发展哪些新的机构，新机构的设置及其依据，设置的条件、地区、时间及设置以后如何发展。第四、重要的调查和考察工作，包括综合性的和专业的，按地区组织的和按专业组织的，一个研究单位组织的和院内外几个研究单位联合组织的。第五、重要科学著作和图书资料的编纂。第六、干部的培养。第七、基本建设和财务概算。
    指示着重说明，制定远景计划是一项极其繁重的工作，必须充分发挥各学部委员、各研究所的科学家的智慧和力量，并取得国家计划委员会、各产业部门、高等教育部及各高等学校的协助才能做好。各学部、各研究所应该把远景计划的制定作为当前中心任务之一，积极组织力量，进行调查研究，有领导、有组织、有步骤地进行。
