    Dongting Lake Dike Consolidation Project About to Begin

    The Dongting Lake dike consolidation project in Hunan Province is about to begin, and preparations for construction are actively underway. This year's key lake management projects and annual maintenance projects will mobilize 470,000 laborers, using 38 million cubic meters of earth. Eleven medium and small-sized drainage sluices, water diversion sluices, and ship locks will be built, with the drainage sluice projects at Mingshantou and Datongkou already commencing on October 16th.

    This year's lake management project in Hunan Province is being carried out on the basis of last year's successful efforts, which ensured a bumper harvest for over six million mu of farmland in the counties surrounding the lake. To strive for an even greater harvest next year, to ensure no breaches under the high-water level of 1954, and to alleviate historical waterlogging disasters, this year's lake management project will focus on consolidating the flood channels of the Songzi River and the tail end of the Li River; reinforcing the dikes of South Dongting Lake; constructing drainage, irrigation, and navigation projects in the Datong Lake area; constructing drainage and irrigation projects in the West Dongting Lake area; and dredging the flood channels of the Yuan and Li Rivers. In addition, large-scale renovations will be carried out on the annual maintenance projects of general dikes and embankments.

    Currently, the majority of food, oil, salt, and other non-staple foods for the lake management laborers are being allocated and supplied locally. Other materials and equipment are also being transported to the construction sites from Hankou, Changsha, and other places.

    洞庭湖堤垸整修工程即将开始
    湖南省洞庭湖堤垸整修工程即将开工，施工前的准备工作正在积极进行。今年治湖的重点工程及岁修工程将要动员四十七万名民工；用土达三千八百万公方；兴建中、小型排水闸、引水闸、船闸共十一座，其中明山头和大通口的排水闸工程已在十月十六日开工。
    湖南省今年的治湖工程是在去年治湖工程的基础上进行的。由于去年治湖工程的成功，保证了今年滨湖各县六百多万亩农田的丰收。为了争取明年更大的丰收，保证在一九五四年的高水位下不溃口，减轻历史上的渍水灾害，今年的治湖工程的重点，将要整理松滋河和澧水尾闾的洪道；加固南洞庭湖的堤防，兴建大通湖区的排灌和航运工程；兴建西洞庭湖区的排灌工程和疏濬沅、澧两水的洪道。此外，一般堤垸的岁修工程，也将进行大规模的整修。
    现在，治湖民工的食粮、油盐等副食品等物资大部由当地划拨供应，其他物资和器材，也正由汉口、长沙等地向工地源源调运。
