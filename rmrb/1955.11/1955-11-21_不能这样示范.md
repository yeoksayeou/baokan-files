Cannot Demonstrate This Way

　　The state-owned Xijiao Farm in the suburbs of Beijing had 157 mu of paddy fields in Yangshui Lake, Beiwu Township, which were deeply flooded before the autumn harvest. This farm had plenty of water pumps, and had used them to drain water before, but this time they excused themselves by saying that the water pumps could not pump water less than one chi (Chinese foot, approximately 1/3 meter) deep. They did not drain the water completely, and more than 30 mu of paddy fields were submerged. The nearby Yuquan Agricultural Cooperative and other farmers had drained the water from their paddy fields, and the rice matured quickly. They started harvesting ten days earlier than the farm.

　　Other state-owned farms are demonstrating to the masses with advanced actions, but this farm is putting on a backward appearance to the masses. Because the farm's paddy fields were flooded, the rice not only matured late, but also suffered from wind damage, with many rice plants falling into the water, resulting in a loss of 10,000 jin (5,000 kg) of rice.

　  不能这样示范
    北京市郊区的国营西郊农场，在北坞乡养水湖的一百五十七亩稻田，在秋收前，积了很深的水。这个农场有的是抽水机，也用抽水机排过水，这时却借口抽水机不能抽一尺以下的积水，没有把水排净，还有三十多亩田的稻子浸在水里。附近的玉泉农业合作社和别的农民的稻田都排净了积水，稻子很快就成熟了，他们动手收割的时间比农场早了十天。
    别的国营农场是用先进的行动向群众示范，这个农场却向群众摆出了一付落后的样子。农场的稻田因为有积水，稻子不但成熟得晚，而且遭了风灾，有不少稻子倒伏在水里，造成了少收一万斤稻谷的损失。
