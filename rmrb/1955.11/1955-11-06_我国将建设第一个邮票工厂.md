    China to Build First Postage Stamp Factory
    The preliminary design for China's first postage stamp factory has been completed. According to the Sino-Czechoslovak Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement, the factory was designed with the assistance of Czechoslovak experts. Construction of the factory will begin next year.
    In the past, China did not have a specialized postage stamp printing factory. Postage stamps were printed by other printing factories on a commission basis. Commemorative stamps could only be printed in monochrome, and could not be produced in large quantities.
    The postage stamp factory to be built will be fully automated. In the future, each machine will be able to print more than 7,400 stamps per minute. It will be able to mass-produce ordinary stamps, and also print multi-colored commemorative stamps and color postcards. (Xinhua News Agency)

    我国将建设第一个邮票工厂
    我国第一个邮票工厂的初步设计已经做好。根据中、捷科学与技术合作协定，这个厂是由捷克斯洛伐克专家帮助设计的。工厂将在明年开工。
    我国过去没有专门印刷邮票的工厂。邮票都是委托别的印刷工厂代印的。纪念邮票也只能印单色，而且不能大量生产。
    将要兴建的这个邮票工厂是全部自动化的，将来每部机器在一分钟内可以印出七千四百多张邮票。它可以大量生产普通邮票，也可以印套色的纪念邮票和彩色明信片。　（新华社）
