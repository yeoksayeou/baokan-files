　　At the Quluota Dairy Farm
　　Mǎjiā
　　In the Houhangai Province of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Quluota Dairy Farm is a place of beautiful scenery. On the right is a mountain covered with dense trees, a lush green when viewed from afar. On the left is the Qielu River, narrow with shallow, clear water, allowing you to see straight to the bottom. Rows of cattle pens line the bank, along with the registrar's desk, and ten yurts supported by white felt. In the evening, the blue smoke from burning dried cow dung rises from the yurts, drifts over the cattle pens, swirls in the sky above the Qielu River, and slowly dissipates into the distance as wisps of gray.

　　When I arrived at the dairy farm, a herd of cows was returning, and the milkmaids were milking. Team leader Yadongsilong came out of a yurt, inspected the cattle pens, and walked over to the milking area. He was very sturdy, like a wrestler from the Naadam festival. He enthusiastically showed me the cattle pens, the cream-making machine, and his yurt, before we went to the milking area. He pointed to a milkmaid in her twenties and said:

　　"This is Daolege'erjiabu. The new method of milking three times a day started with her."

　　Daolege'erjiabu sat on a low stool, gently singing a folk song while skillfully milking the udder of a purplish-red cow. The milk flowed smoothly into a white aluminum bucket below. The cow stood obediently before her, as if hypnotized by the folk song, head down, tail not even twitching.

　　At that moment, ten milkmaids were milking simultaneously, sitting on stools of the same size, wearing identical white uniforms, and performing the operation in a similar manner. Only the cows were different: some purplish-red, some brownish-yellow, some deep red, some spotted, some with white markings. They all had large tails, thick necks, and short bodies, mostly without horns, and about a fist shorter than Chinese yellow cattle. Yadongsilong stared at the purplish-red cow, and seeing that it wasn't moving, praised:

　　"Dabixiliepo is so obedient!"

　　Daolege'erjiabu stopped singing, and while using her hands to stroke the cow's udder, looked up at Yadongsilong from under her flowered headscarf and smiled happily.

　　"Dabixiliepo won't leave until the task is completed."

　　The translator, Guerside, told me that Dabixiliepo means progress.

　　I asked Yadongsilong, "How much milk does Dabixiliepo produce in a day?"

　　Yadongsilong touched his bald head and said excitedly:

　　"Sometimes six and a half liters, sometimes six and eight-tenths liters. Yesterday it produced seven liters."

　　"If it exceeds seven liters today, that will be progress."

　　Yadongsilong laughed happily at my words. He told me that in the past, using the old method of milking twice a day, they only got four or five liters. The new method of milking three times a day has increased production by an average of thirteen percent. Last year, the dairy farm exceeded its target by 69,000 liters of milk. Last year, because Daolege'erjiabu exceeded her target, she was awarded a gold-lettered book at the women's congress in Ulan Bator. Daolege'erjiabu's new milking method was also mentioned in the report of the 12th Congress of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and promoted throughout the country. Provincial Party secretaries, production team leaders, herders, cooperative chairmen, and milkmaids from various provinces have come here to exchange experiences. The famous Soviet milkmaid, Nikolaeva, has also visited.

　　"Is your new method related to the Soviet Union?"

　　"Yes, let me tell you."

　　The year before last, the Mongolian People's Republic held a Mongolian-Soviet Friendship Month, calling for learning from the Soviet Union and creating new work experiences. Yadongsilong launched a competition, pondering and researching, and proposed the method of milking three times a day during the movement. Most milkmaids maintained the old habit of milking twice a day and opposed the new method. Only Daolege'erjiabu accepted Yadongsilong's suggestion, unafraid of opposition from other milkmaids, used the new method to milk three times a day, and increased milk production. The Houhangai Party Committee supported their new method, awarded them a cream-making machine, and equipped them with technicians. The Academy of Sciences and the Ministry of Animal Husbandry listened to their report, summarized their experience, and promoted it throughout the country. Yadongsilong received two Gold Star Medals, a Choibalsan gold-lettered book, and was elected as a delegate to the Mongolian People's Great Khural.

　　Yadongsilong is a very outstanding milking team leader. He understands the temperament of cows and their lives. Cows like to live in mountainous areas, so he built cattle pens at the foot of the mountains. Cows can withstand the cold. In February, when the blue snow falls, he lets them roll around in the snow. In the summer, when grazing, he always selects a fertile pasture with abundant water, like this beautiful pasture near the Qielu River, allowing the cows to bathe, which is healthy and increases milk production. When a cow gives birth to a calf, he finds a way to separate them, so that the cow produces more milk.

　　Daolege'erjiabu finished milking, left the stool, and carried the aluminum bucket of milk to the registrar to be recorded. At that moment, the other nine milkmaids also finished milking, took off their white work clothes, and went for a walk on the grass. The cows that had been milked seemed to relax, wagging their tails and strolling leisurely. On the milking area, there was also a large herd of cows that had just bathed, scrambling onto the grass in groups, creating a lively scene. The milkmaids, technicians, herders, and team leader Yadongsilong also mingled with the cattle. They finished their work for the day and spent this pleasant time together.

　　I followed Yadongsilong into the herd. Yadongsilong knew the history, habits, and personality traits of every cow, and could even call out their names.

　　A cow with a white back came, head up, ears erect, the tips of its ears also white, its deep purple fur mixed with white markings, particularly fresh. As soon as Yadongsilong saw this cow, he called out its name:

　　"Tonggela."

　　I asked Yadongsilong, "What does Tonggela mean?"

　　"In Mongolian, it means clean."

　　I pointed to a yellow cow with thick horns and a watermelon-shaped belly and asked:

　　"What's it called?"

　　"It's called Wulijige. Wulijige means increase."

　　A deep red cow is called "October," and a spotted cow is called "Brightness."

　　Yadongsilong said, "The milkmaids know the attributes of the cows, and the names are very appropriate."

　　I nodded in agreement. Suddenly, I thought of the cow named "Dabixiliepo" earlier. I asked Yadongsilong, how much milk did it produce today? Yadongsilong turned to ask the registrar, who looked at the record and reported:

　　"Seven and a half liters, breaking yesterday's record."

　　"Another step forward!" Yadongsilong laughed loudly.

　　When Daolege'erjiabu walked over with her flowered headscarf, many milkmaids congratulated her. Yadongsilong was in high spirits, and he raised his voice and said:

　　"Let's have a celebration! Today, a Chinese friend has come to our dairy farm, and he must also be happy about our overproduction."

　　In the evening, the pine forest on the hillside turned indigo. The Qielu River was covered with a thin mist. The cows went into the cattle pens. It was almost time to drink horse milk wine and beef soup, and smoke from burning cow dung rose from the yurts. On the grass of the milking area, an accordion played a Mongolian pastoral song, and a group of young men and women ran over and danced in circles: there were milkmaids wearing Mongolian flower robes, registrars wearing work clothes, oil workers wearing caps, and herders wearing Mongolian hooked boots. In the crowd, Daolege'erjiabu's figure appeared particularly slender and tall, and her movements were also agile. She wore a shimmering red satin long shirt, tied with a green belt, wrapped in a flower headscarf, spinning left and right, lightly dancing in the crowd.

　　After the people finished dancing, they were reluctant to leave and stood in a circle on the grass, singing a cattle song:

　　The herd moving on the pasture,
　　Like waves of spring wheat.
　　The herders of the new era,
　　Live in the big family of the cooperative.
　　The cattle on the mountain,
　　Endless lush green grass,
　　The happy herders,
　　Sing endless crisp songs.

　　Yadongsilong told me about the process of composing this song. One morning, as the sun was just rising, he went out to inspect the work, looking at the green grass on the hillside, where a herd of cows was grazing. He heard a crisp sound coming from the herd. The next morning, when he woke up, he seemed to hear the crisp sound coming from the herd again, the sound fascinated him, moved him, and he composed this song.

　　Yadongsilong explained why he liked the cattle so much:

　　"We are a livestock country, and our socialist construction must accumulate wealth bit by bit from animal husbandry. Our milk can be exported on the international market. In domestic life, we must supply the needs of the urban people, like our capital Ulan Bator."

　　I said, "I drank your milk at the Altai Hotel in Ulan Bator. The quality is very good. Today, I met you and should be especially grateful to you!"

　　At the time of parting, Yadongsilong hugged me, powerfully and warmly.

　　I crossed the Qielu River and walked towards Quluota Sumu. It was getting dark, the grass was vast and gray, covered with a thin gray smoke, and a string of green fireballs flickered in the deep grass in front. I walked closer and realized that they were the eyes of sheep. I turned back and looked at the yurts in the milking area, twinkling like faint red fireballs. I thought to myself: "Probably Yadongsilong is drinking horse milk wine inside."

### 在曲洛它挤奶场

　　在曲洛它挤奶场
　　马加
    在蒙古人民共和国后杭爱省，曲洛它挤奶场是一处风景美丽的地方。右边靠着一座山，山上长着密密的树，远远地望去，一色姣绿。左边临着切路河，河身窄，水流浅而清，一眼望到底。岸边搭着成排的牛栏，放着登记员办公的桌子，排列着十个用白毡撑起的蒙古包。到了晚上，蒙古包升起干牛粪的青烟，飘过牛栏，在切路河的上空打旋，一缕青灰，慢慢地向远处飘散。
    我到挤奶场的时候，一群犀牛回到挤奶场上，挤奶员挤着奶。队长亚东斯隆从蒙古包里走出来，视察一下牛栏，走到挤奶场上来。他的身体非常结实，好像是那达慕大会上的摔跤家。他热情地领我看了牛栏，看了制奶油机器，看了他住的蒙古包，随后到挤奶场上来。他指着旁边一个二十几岁的女挤奶员说：
    “这是道乐格尔加布，一天挤三次奶的新经验，是从她开始的。”
    道乐格尔加布坐在一只矮腿凳子上，一边轻轻地唱着民歌，一边敏捷地挤着一头绛紫色犀牛的乳房，牛奶畅快地流到下面一只白色的铝桶里。那犀牛驯服地站在她的跟前，仿佛给民歌催眠住了，低着头，尾巴一摇也不摇。
    这工夫，十个挤奶员同时在挤奶，坐着一样大小的凳子，穿着一样白色的工作服，操作也仿佛一样。只是犀牛不一样，有绛紫色的，有褐黄色的，有深红色的、有花斑的，有带着白花的。它们全是大尾巴，粗脖颈，身腰短，大半没长角，比中国的黄牛大约矮一拳头。亚东斯隆盯住了那条绛紫色的犀牛，见它一动也不动，夸奖了一句：
      “达必西列坡可听话呢！”
    道乐格尔加布停止了唱歌，一边用手橹犀牛的奶子，一边仰起花头巾，瞅了亚东斯隆一眼，愉快地笑一笑。
      “达必西列坡不完成任务，是不会走的。”
    翻译古尔斯德告诉我说：达必西列坡就是进步的意思。
    我问亚东斯隆：“达必西列坡一天挤多少牛奶？”
    亚东斯隆摸摸光脑袋，兴奋地对我说：
      “有时候挤六公升半，有时候挤六公升八。昨天挤七公升。”
      “如果今天超过七公升，就是进步了。”
    亚东斯隆听了我的话，快活地笑了。他告诉我：过去用老方法：一天挤两次，只挤四、五公升。新方法一天挤三次，产量平均增加百分之十三。挤奶场去年超额完成六万九千公升奶。去年，由于道乐格尔加布超额完成了任务，在乌兰巴托的妇女大会上，奖给她金字书。在蒙古人民革命党第十二次代表大会的报告里，也提到道乐格尔加布的挤奶新经验，向全国介绍推广。到这里来交流经验的，有各省的省委书记、生产队长、牧畜家、合作社社长、挤奶员，苏联有名的挤奶员尼克拉叶娃也到过这里。
    “你们的新经验是不是和苏联有关系？”
    “有关系，你听我说吧。”
    前年，全蒙古人民共和国举行蒙苏友好月，号召向苏联学习，创造新的工作经验。亚东斯隆发动竞赛，揣摩研究，在运动中提出一天挤三次奶的方法。挤奶员大都保持挤两次奶的老习惯，反对新方法。只有道乐格尔加布接受了亚东斯隆的建议，不怕别的挤奶员反对，用新方法挤三次奶，提高了牛奶的产量。后杭爱党委支持他们的新方法，奖给他们制奶油机，配备了技术员。科学院和畜牧业部听取了他们的报告，把他们的经验加以总结，向全国推广。亚东斯隆获得两颗金星勋章，一本乔巴山金字书，并且当选了蒙古人民大呼拉尔代表。
    亚东斯隆是一个非常出色的挤奶队长。他懂得犀牛的性情，犀牛的生活。犀牛喜欢居住在山多的地方，他就在山坡下搭起牛栏来。犀牛能耐寒，二月里下青雪，他让它们在雪地里打滚。夏天放牧，他一定挑选一个草肥水畅像靠切路河这个幽美的牧场，让犀牛洗洗澡，又健康，又能增加奶汁。乳牛生下了小牛，他就想法隔离开，这样乳牛就多出奶。
    道乐格尔加布挤完了牛奶，离开了凳子，提着装牛奶的铝桶，送到登记员那里去登记。这工夫，另外九个挤奶员也挤完了奶，脱去了白工作服，到草地上去散步。那些被挤过奶的乳牛似乎也轻松起来，摇着尾巴，闲散地蹓跶着。在挤奶场上，还有刚刚洗过澡的一大群犀牛，左一群，右一伙，乱哄哄地闯到草地上来，显得热热闹闹。挤奶员、技术员、牧民、队长亚东斯隆，也都混到牛群里。他们做完了当天的工作，共同来度过这愉快的时间。
    我随着亚东斯隆走进犀牛群里。亚东斯隆知道每一条犀牛出生的历史、生活习惯、性格特征，还能叫出它们的名字。
    一条白脊背的犀牛来了，仰着头，竖着耳朵，耳梢也是白的，深紫色的皮毛掺杂着白花，分外新鲜。亚东斯隆一看见这条牛，就叫出它的名字：
      “通格拉。”
    我问亚东斯隆：“通格拉是什么意思？”
      “用蒙古话说，就是清洁。”
    我指着一条长着粗角和西瓜肚子的黄犀牛问道：
      “它叫什么？”
      “它叫乌里基格，乌里基格就是增加的意思。”
  一条深红色的大犀牛叫“十月”，一条花斑犀牛叫“光明”。
    亚东斯隆说：“挤奶员知道犀牛的属性，名字都起得很恰当。”
    我点头承认。忽然，我想起方才那条叫“达必西列坡”的犀牛，我问着亚东斯隆，今天挤多少牛奶？亚东斯隆转问登记员，登记员看看记录，报告说：
      “七公升半，打破了昨天的纪录。”
      “又进步啦！”亚东斯隆哈哈大笑起来。
    道乐格尔加布扎着花头巾走过来的时候，许多挤奶员都向她祝贺。亚东斯隆兴致很高，他提高喉咙说：
    “大家来欢乐一场吧！今天，在我们的挤奶场上来了一位中国朋友，他也一定为我们的超额生产感到高兴。”
    晚上，山坡上的松林变成靛青色。切路河蒙上一层薄幕。犀牛进了牛栏里。快要喝马奶酒和牛肉汤的时候，蒙古包里升起牛粪的炊烟。在挤奶场的草地上，手风琴奏起蒙古牧歌，一群青年男女都跑过来，团团转地跳起舞来：有穿着蒙古花袍的女挤奶员，穿着工作服的登记员，戴着便帽的制油工人，蹬着蒙古钩靴的牧民。在人群里，道乐格尔加布的身材显得特别细高，动作也敏捷，她穿着闪光的红缎子长衫，扎着绿带子，包着花头巾，左旋右转，轻轻地在人群里飘舞起来。
    人们跳完了舞，还舍不得走开，在草地上站了一圈，唱了一首牛群歌：
    牧场上蠕动的牛群，
    像春天的麦浪掀起波纹。
    新时代的牧民，
    生活在合作社的大家庭里。
    山上的牛群呀，
    吃不尽的野草青青，
    幸福的牧民呀，
    唱不完的清脆歌声。
    亚东斯隆告诉我编这首歌子的经过。有一天早晨，太阳刚冒嘴，他出去检查工作，望着山坡上一片青青草地，一群犀牛正在那里放牧。他听见牛群里发出一种清脆的声音。他第二天早晨起来，耳朵里仿佛又听到牛群发出的清脆声音，那声音使他迷恋，使他感动，就编了这首歌子。
    亚东斯隆为什么喜欢牛群，他说得好：
    “我们是一个畜牧业国家，我们的社会主义建设，就要从畜牧业上一点一滴积累财富。在国际市场上，我们的牛奶可以出口。在国内生活中，我们要供应城市人民的需要，像我们的首都乌兰巴托。”
    我说：“我在乌兰巴托的阿尔泰旅馆，喝过你们的牛奶，质量很好，今天我见了你，应该特别感激你！”
    临别的时候，亚东斯隆拥抱我，有力而热情。
    我过了切路河，向着曲洛它苏木走去。天黑了，草地上一片苍苍，蒙着薄薄的灰烟，在前边的深草棵子里，闪烁着一串绿火球。我走到近前，才看出是羊的眼睛。我回过头去，望着挤奶场上的蒙古包，星星点点，那里闪着淡淡的红火球。我心里想：“大概亚东斯隆正在里面喝马奶酒吧。”
