Combining Party Rectification with Socialist Education

The Battle Agricultural Production Cooperative in Changxing Village, Huguan County, Shanxi Province, was established in 1951 by merging two mutual aid groups. Initially, it had only twenty-one households, but by the autumn of 1953, it had grown to one hundred and three households, achieving complete cooperativization in the village. As the cooperative developed, all twenty-four Party members in the village joined the cooperative, and the village branch formally changed into the Battle Agricultural Production Cooperative Branch.

After the expansion of the Battle Cooperative, many problems arose, the main ones being: 1. The financial system was extremely chaotic. Accountants Xu Jishun and Xu Jiashun (a counter-revolutionary element who fraudulently obtained the positions of branch secretary and vice-chairman) jointly embezzled 1,600 yuan of public funds from the cooperative. As a result, fifty-seven cooperative members were in debt last year due to unfair distribution. At the same time, many expenditure items in the cooperative had no receipts at all. Irregular expenses such as buying cigarettes and eating steamed buns amounted to 174 yuan in 1954 alone. Cooperative members complained: "Our cooperative's accountant has a mouth like a running stream and a stomach full of old debts, saying whatever he wants." 2. 富农 (rich peasant) element Xu Hexi infiltrated the cooperative as a shepherd. He caused the death of eighty-five sheep. Later, he hollowed out the pillar of the sheep pen, attempting to crush all the sheep to death. This was discovered and prevented. 3. Poor management, lax discipline, and production plans could not be achieved at all. In 1954, the original plan was to produce 270 jin of grain per mu, but only 217 jin were produced. This year, the original plan was to apply 82 dan of fertilizer per mu, but 60 mu of land were not fertilized, and 53 mu were sown without plowing. Two hundred mu of corn lacked one-fifth of the seedlings.

Why did such serious problems occur in this cooperative, and why were they not dealt with in a timely manner? This is closely related to the many problems existing in the Party branch.

Among the twenty-four Party members in the Party branch, twenty had varying degrees of arrogance and complacency, and seven branch committee members were even more serious. They attributed all the achievements of the village to themselves, becoming arrogant and complacent, and not seeking progress. They even boasted that "we won't fall behind even if we don't work for three years." Xu Shunhai, the township general branch secretary, arrogantly said: "Our village's Party members are really strong. Ordinary Party members can be branch secretaries in other villages." Xu Haishui (the cooperative chairman) often relied on his seniority, saying: "I cultivated twenty-three of the twenty-four Party members in our village. Now that we have Jiashun for paperwork and Xiaobao for action, I should enjoy a few days of leisure." They tried to resist or make things difficult for superior cadres who sincerely criticized them. However, they treated individual staff members who frequently praised their achievements as honored guests. Because most Party members had serious arrogance and complacency, they turned a blind eye to the sabotage of class enemies. Cooperative members reported "the 富农 (rich peasant) starved the sheep to death," but Chairman Xu Haishui said: "People get sick too, what does it matter if sheep die?" Cooperative members reported "unclear accounts and embezzlement," but Xu Haishui said: "Ten fingers are not all the same length, a small mistake doesn't matter." How can such a branch lead the cooperative well?

More seriously, the organization was impure. Counter-revolutionary element Xu Jiashun had participated in the Kuomintang. When the Japanese invaders occupied the area, he colluded with traitors to sabotage the resistance against Japan. In 1944, he concealed his history and joined the Party. After that, he used double-dealing tactics to gain the trust of the Party. In 1953, he fraudulently obtained important positions such as secretary of the Battle Agricultural Cooperative Branch and vice-chairman. He frequently exploited the weaknesses of some Party member cadres, sending gifts and lending money to buy them over, organizing small cliques, sowing discord, and sabotaging the Party's policies. After the division of townships in 1953, Xu Shunhai was elected as the Party's township general branch secretary, and Xu Jiashun took the opportunity to sow discord, making Xu Haishui dissatisfied with the Party. After the implementation of the unified purchase of grain that winter, Xu Jiashun incited everyone to be dissatisfied with Zhang Xiaobao, causing doubts about the Party's policies. During the expansion of the cooperative, he deliberately pulled 富农 (rich peasants) Xu Hexi and Xu Longqi into the cooperative, and suppressed and excluded poor peasants within the cooperative.

How to carry out Party rectification and socialist education? When the work team first arrived in the village, most Party members said that their village was a model village and there was nothing to rectify. The work team and the branch committee members conducted research and analysis, believing that the ideological situation of Party members at that time could be roughly divided into three types: The first type included Zhang Xiaobao, Xu Shunhai, and other eight Party members. They knew that there were problems in the cooperative, but they were unwilling to expose them for fear of losing the title of "model village." The second type included Xu Xishun, Li Jingxian, and other ten Party members, who knew there were problems but dared not speak out, fearing retaliation from Xu Jiashun and Xu Haishui. The third type was Xu Haishui's group, who feared being punished if the problems were clarified (counter-revolutionary element Xu Jiashun was of course afraid of being exposed). Based on this analysis, the Party members were first organized to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, as well as the report on the suppression of democracy incident in the coking department of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. Through study, the ideological understanding of Party members was improved, clarifying the sharpness and complexity of the class struggle in the transition period, criticizing arrogance and complacency, and underestimating the enemy's paralysis. They examined and exposed the problems existing in the branch and the cooperative. After Xu Shunhai examined his mistakes in making false reports in the past two years, he said: "Only pursuing good reputation without practical work is the reason for the decline in production, the result of arrogance." Zhang Xiaobao also examined his arrogance and complacency, and exposed Xu Haishui's reliance on seniority and the superficial style of not going deep into his work. Xu Xishun revealed Xu Jiashun's conspiracy to sow discord. Xu Jiyuan revealed the 富农 (rich peasant) Xu Hexi's sabotage of the sheep flock and said: "We boast about being a model every day, but the 富农 (rich peasant) is about to grab us by the neck." Xu Guize was originally one of those pulled into a small clique by Xu Jiashun. After listening to the comrades' speeches, he slowly realized his mistakes and angrily exposed Xu Jiashun's criminal activities of colluding with 富农 (rich peasants) and making false accounts for embezzlement. After listening to everyone's speeches, Xu Haishui also began to feel that the problem was serious and expressed his determination, saying: "This time, I must stand with everyone and thoroughly clarify the problems within the Party and the cooperative." Then he revealed the facts that Xu Jiashun gave him meat and cigarettes, confirming that the comrades' speeches were true. This exposed the true face of the counter-revolutionary element Xu Jiashun, who had infiltrated the Party and usurped the leadership, and left him isolated. At this time, most Party members felt that it was not that there was nothing to rectify, but that it was impossible not to rectify. On this basis, the branch, while continuing to understand and clarify the revealed problems, formulated plans for rectifying the cooperative and the Party, and mobilized all Party members to shift the focus to the work of rectifying the cooperative.

Then, the branch led Party members to go deep into the cooperative members, publicizing the purpose and significance of rectifying the cooperative and the Party's class policy, and mobilizing cooperative members to participate in the work of rectifying the cooperative. At first, many cooperative members believed that "rectifying or not is the same, just wasting a few days of work," and did not believe that the cooperative could be thoroughly rectified. Party members, on the one hand, showed the cooperative members their determination to rectify the cooperative well, and on the other hand, publicized the facts of the counter-revolutionary elements sabotaging the Jinxing Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Xigou, Pingshun, specifically and vividly explaining the fierceness of the class struggle. In order to attract everyone to actively rectify the cooperative and fully promote democracy, the branch also adopted the following three methods: First, the cooperative members elected representatives to organize a cooperative rectification committee, which widely contacted cooperative members and collected their opinions through the representatives; second, a special cooperative rectification suggestion box was set up; and third, the work team went deep into the fields to conduct visits. This worked very well. A total of forty-seven opinions from the cooperative members regarding the rectification of the cooperative and Party issues were received from the representatives and in the suggestion box, covering a wide range of content.

After the masses were mobilized, the branch grasped the issue of accounts that the cooperative members were most concerned about, and started the rectification from clearing up embezzlement. A liquidation team was organized with active elements inside and outside the Party, including Party member Xu Zhuhai, poor peasant cooperative members Xu Guangrong and Xu Juzhong, and seven cooperative member representatives. After detailed verification, the criminal facts of accountant Xu Jishun colluding with Xu Jiashun to embezzle 1,600 yuan were found. Then, the income of 1954 was re-distributed, and the list was posted in a timely manner: the output per dan was increased from the original distribution of 1.90 yuan to 2.30 yuan, and each work day was increased from the original distribution of 0.32 yuan to 0.46 yuan. In this way, the original fifty-seven households in debt due to unfair distribution became deposit households. At this time, the cooperative members' emotions were even higher, and the branch seized the fact that 富农 (rich peasant) Xu Hexi had sabotaged the sheep flock, further conducting class education for the cooperative members, improving the cooperative members' class consciousness and deepening their hatred for class enemies. Everyone unanimously demanded that the government bring these bad guys to justice.

At the request of the masses, after the county procuratorial organs verified the materials one by one and went through certain procedures, the counter-revolutionary element Xu Jiashun, the embezzler Xu Jishun, and the 富农 (rich peasant) element Xu Hexi, who had sabotaged the agricultural cooperative, were arrested and brought to justice. On this basis, all cooperative members turned to deliberating and discussing the election of new cooperative staff and formulating various working systems within the cooperative.

After the preliminary rectification of the agricultural cooperative and the cleansing of counter-revolutionary elements, and after educating all Party members with vivid facts, ideological examination was further carried out within the Party. Xu Haishui painfully examined his mistakes. He said in surprise: "People can't just look at the face, my literary assistant (referring to Xu Jiashun) almost cost me my life, this is the end of arrogance and complacency." With the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism, and based on the eight criteria for Party members and their performance in this rectification of the cooperative and the Party, Party members were carefully reviewed and evaluated. Xu Haishui, Xu Yushui and other three people committed serious mistakes, but they were active in the rectification of the cooperative, examined their mistakes relatively thoroughly, and expressed their determination to correct them. The branch decided to give them a warning within the Party. Xu Guihai and Xu Changfa knew that Xu Jiashun had sabotaged the facts but did not report them in time, and the branch gave them criticism and education. Zhang Xiaobao, Xu Zhuhai and other five people who had always been active in their work, resolute in their struggle, and performed well in the rectification of the cooperative and the Party were commended. After the Party members were evaluated, the branch was re-elected, and Zhang Xiaobao, Xu Zhuhai, and Xu Zhangshun were elected as branch committee members. After the new branch committee was elected, it formulated a branch work plan, and everyone unanimously expressed that they would strengthen unity and run the cooperative well.

Because the Party members had been evaluated, they were able to play a model and leading role in the cooperative when checking compliance with the cooperative charter. The branch checked its leadership of the cooperative. Cooperative chairman Xu Haishui examined his mistakes. The cooperative members, on the one hand, criticized some derelict cadres, and on the other hand, also seriously examined their various mistakes. A total of forty-seven people in the cooperative examined their mistakes for not strictly complying with the cooperative charter. Then, the cooperative cadres were re-elected, and Zhang Xiaobao, Xu Fazhu, Xu Guangrong and other twelve Party members and poor peasant active cooperative members were elected, strengthening the Party's leadership over the cooperative organizationally. After the new cooperative affairs committee was formed, it immediately carried out division of labor, formulated the cooperative's financial management system, equipped with a new accountant, and improved the cooperative's various meeting systems. Because democracy was fully promoted in the rectification of the cooperative, the problems within the cooperative were resolved more thoroughly, and the cooperative members' production enthusiasm was very high. In the more than twenty days after the rectification alone, the cooperative members increased the purchase of thirteen new agricultural tools (including a double-wheeled double-share plow), two horses, and two carts. Xu Qifu and other three cooperative members who had gone out to produce in the past because the cooperative was not well run also rushed back to participate in the cooperative's production.

    整党整社工作结合进行
    中共长治地委组织部
    山西省壶关县常行村战斗农业生产合作社是在一九五一年由两个互助组合并建立起来的。初建社的时候只有二十一户，到一九五三年秋后就发展到一百零三户，全村实现了合作化。随着社的发展，全村二十四个党员全部入了社，村支部也就正式改变为战斗农业生产合作社分支部。
    战斗合作社扩大后，发生了不少问题，主要的有：一、财务制度十分混乱，会计徐计顺和徐加顺（反革命分子，骗取了支部书记和副社长职务）共同贪污社内公款一千六百元。这样，就使去年社内有五十七户社员因为分配不实而欠债。同时，社内好多开支项目根本就没有凭据，光一九五四年买纸烟、吃蒸馍等不合制度的开支竟达一百七十四元。社员反映：“咱社的会计嘴是流水，肚是老账，说啥算啥。”二、富农分子徐和喜钻进社内当羊工。他弄死了八十五只羊。后来他又将羊窑柱脚?空，企图把羊全都压死。因为被人发觉，没有办成。三、管理不善，纪律松懈，生产计划根本不能实现。一九五四年每亩土地原计划产粮二百七十斤，结果只产了二百一十七斤。今年原计划每亩地上肥八十二担，实际上有六十亩地没上肥，并且有五十三亩地没有耕就下了种，有二百亩地种玉茭缺苗五分之一。
    这个合作社为什么会发生这样严重的问题，而又不能及时得到处理呢？这同党支部存在不少问题有密切关系。
    党支部一共有二十四个党员，其中就有二十个党员有程度不同的骄傲自满情绪，七个支部委员更为严重，他们把全村工作成绩完全记在个人名下，骄傲自满，不求前进。他们甚至夸口什么“三年不工作也落不了后”。乡总支书记徐顺孩自高自大地说：“咱村的党员真强，普通党员到外村也能当个支部书记。”徐海水（社长）经常依老卖老地说：“咱村二十四个党员，有二十三个是我培养起来的，现在工作文的有加顺，武的有小保，我该享几天清福啦。”对于认真对他们提出批评的上级干部，他们就设法抵抗或为难。但对经常替他们吹嘘成绩的个别工作人员却是宾客相待。正因为多数党员有严重骄傲自满情绪，他们就对阶级敌人的破坏熟视无睹。社员纷纷反映“富农把羊困死了”，社长徐海水还说：“人还要生病，羊死算什么？”社员反映“账目不清有人贪污”，徐海水却说：“十个指头不一般齐，差一错二算不了个啥。”像这样的支部，怎么能领导办好合作社呢？
    更严重的是组织不纯。反革命分子徐加顺曾经参加过国民党，日寇侵占的时候，他又同汉奸勾结，破坏抗日。一九四四年他隐瞒历史混入了党内以后，利用两面派手法，取得了党的信任，一九五三年他骗取了战斗农业社分支部书记和副社长等重要职务。他经常利用某些党员干部的弱点，送东西、借钱，进行收买，组织小集团，挑拨离间，破坏党的政策。一九五三年划乡后，徐顺孩当选为党的乡总支书记，徐加顺便趁机挑拨，使徐海水对党不满。这年冬天粮食实行统购以后，徐加顺又煽动大家对张小保不满，对党的政策发生了怀疑。在扩大合作社的时候，他又有意把富农徐和喜、徐龙岐拉进社内，并且在社内打击排挤贫农。
    怎样进行整党和整社呢？工作组刚到村的时候，大部分党员说他们村是模范村，没有啥可整。工作组和支委们进行了研究分析，认为当时党员思想情况大概可分三种：第一种是：张小保、徐顺孩等八个党员，他们也知道社内有问题，因怕失掉“模范村”的称号，就不愿揭露问题。第二种有徐喜顺、李景仙等十个党员，明知有问题，但不敢说，怕遭到徐加顺、徐海水的报复。第三种是徐海水的一伙，怕把问题搞清自己受处分（反革命分子徐加顺当然是怕把自己露出来）。根据这个分析，首先组织党员学习了党的七届四中全会文件，还学习了关于太原钢铁厂炼焦部压制民主事件的报道。通过学习，党员的思想认识提高了，明确了过渡时期阶级斗争的尖锐性和复杂性，批判了骄傲自满情绪和轻敌麻痹思想，检查和揭发了支部和合作社里存在的问题。徐顺孩检查了自己前二年作假报告的错误后说：“光图好听没有实干，这就是减产的原因，骄傲的结果。”张小保也检查了自己的骄傲自满情绪，揭发了徐海水依老卖老思想和工作不深入的肤浅作风。徐喜顺揭露了徐加顺挑拨离间的阴谋。徐积元揭露了富农徐和喜破坏羊群的事情后说：“我们天天夸自己模范，可是富农快捏住我们的脖子了。”徐贵则原来是被徐加顺拉入小集团的一个，听了同志们的发言，也慢慢认识了自己的错误，愤怒地揭发了徐加顺勾结富农、造假账进行贪污的罪恶活动。徐海水听了大家发言后也开始感到问题严重，表示自己的决心说：“这次我一定和大家站在一起，把党内和社内问题彻底搞清。”接着他就揭露了徐加顺给他送肉、纸烟等事实，证实了同志们的发言是真实的。这样就使得钻入党内并篡夺了领导职务的反革命分子徐加顺的原形毕露，陷于孤立。这时，绝大部分党员都感到不是没啥整，而是不整就不行了。在此基础上，支部一面将所揭发的问题继续进行了解澄清，一面制定了整社和整党计划，发动全体党员把重点转向整社工作。
    接着支部就领导党员深入到社员中，宣传整社的目的、意义和党的阶级政策，发动社员参加整社工作。起初，不少社员认为“整不整一个样，不过白误几天工”，不相信能把社彻底整好。党员一面向社员表明一定要把社整顿好的决心，一面给大家宣传了反革命分子破坏平顺西沟金星农林牧生产合作社的事实，具体生动地说明了阶级斗争的激烈。为了吸引大家积极整社，更充分地发扬民主，支部还采取了以下三种方法：一是由社员选举出代表，组织了整社委员会，通过代表广泛地联系社员，收集社员的意见；二是设立了专门的整社意见箱；三是工作组深入田间进行访问。这样做效果很好，从代表口中和意见箱内共收到社员群众提出的四十七件有关整社和党内问题的意见，内容十分广泛。
    当群众发动起来以后，支部就抓住社员最关心的账目问题，从清算贪污着手进行整顿。以党内外的积极分子党员徐珠孩，贫农社员徐光荣、徐聚中等和社员代表七人组织了清算小组，经过详细的查对结果，查出会计徐计顺勾结徐加顺贪污一千六百元的罪恶事实。接着便将一九五四年收入重新作了分配，及时贴出了清单：每石产量由原分配一元九角提高到二元三角，每个劳动日由原分配三角二分提高到四角六分。这样，原来因分配不实而欠债的五十七户就变成存款户了。这时社员情绪更高起来了，支部又抓住富农徐和喜破坏羊群的事实，进一步对社员进行了阶级教育，提高社员的阶级觉悟和加深对阶级敌人的仇恨。大家一致要求政府法办这些坏家伙。
    在群众的要求下，经县检察机关一一对证材料后，经过一定手续，就把破坏农业社的反革命分子徐加顺、贪污分子徐计顺和富农分子徐和喜等人逮捕法办。在此基础上全体社员转向酝酿讨论选举新的社内工作人员和制定社内各项工作制度。
    经过对农业社的初步整顿和清洗反革命分子，用活生生的事实教育了全体党员之后，党内又进一步进行思想检查。徐海水痛心地检查了自己的错误。他吃惊地说：“人不能光看面皮，我这个文助手（指徐加顺），险些把我命要了，这就是骄傲自满的下场。”随着批评和自我批评的展开，根据党员标准八项条件和这次整社整党中的表现，对党员进行了慎重的审查鉴定。徐海水、徐玉水等三人犯有严重错误，但在整社中表现积极，检查自己的错误比较彻底，表示决心改正，支部决定给予党内警告处分。徐贵孩、徐长法知道徐加顺破坏事实不及时检举，支部给予批评教育。一贯工作积极、斗争坚决、整社整党中表现好的张小保、徐珠孩等五人受到了表扬。党员鉴定之后，支部又进行了改选，张小保、徐珠孩、徐张顺当选为支部委员。新的支委会选出之后，制定了支部工作计划，大家一致表示要加强团结，把社办好。
    因为党员经过了鉴定，所以在社内检查遵守社章的时候，都能起模范带头作用。支部检查了对社的领导。社长徐海水检查了自己的错误。社员一方面对部分失职干部进行了批评，一方面也认真检查了自己的各种错误。全社共有四十七人检查了不严格遵守社章的错误。接着又改选了社干部，张小保、徐法柱、徐光荣等十二个党员和贫农积极社员都当选，从组织上加强了党对社的领导。新社务委员会组成后，马上进行了分工，制定了社内财务管理制度，配备了新会计，健全了社内各种会议制度。由于整社中充分发扬了民主，社内问题解决较透彻，社员的生产情绪十分高涨。仅在整顿后的二十多天中，社员就增买了新式农具十三件（包括双轮双铧犁一部）、马二匹、大车两辆。过去因社办得不好出外生产的徐其富等三个社员，也都赶回来参加了社内生产。
