Chapter I: General Provisions

Article 1: Agricultural production cooperatives are collective economic organizations of laboring peasants. They are formed under the leadership and assistance of the Communist Party and the people's government, based on the principles of voluntarism and mutual benefit. They collectively use the land, draft animals, farm tools, and other major means of production of the members, and gradually turn these means of production into collective ownership. They organize members to engage in collective labor and distribute the results of collective labor among the members.

The purpose of developing agricultural production cooperatives is to gradually eliminate the capitalist exploitation system in rural areas, overcome the backwardness of small-scale peasant economy, develop socialist agriculture, and meet the needs of socialist industrialization. This means gradually replacing private ownership of the means of production with collective ownership by the laboring masses, replacing small-scale production with large-scale, mechanized production, and developing agriculture to a high level, making all peasants prosperous, and meeting the society's increasing demand for agricultural products.

Article 2: Agricultural collectivization is the only bright path for laboring peasants to permanently free themselves from poverty and exploitation. Therefore, agricultural production cooperatives should gradually absorb all laboring peasants into the cooperative, ensuring that socialism prevails in rural areas. Agricultural production cooperatives should achieve this goal not by coercion but by persuasion, setting an example to make peasants who have not yet joined the cooperative realize that joining has only benefits and no losses, thereby voluntarily joining.

Agricultural production cooperatives should be a mutually beneficial union of laboring peasants, especially a mutually beneficial union of poor and middle peasants. Only on the basis of mutual benefit can peasants voluntarily take the path of collectivization. The principle of developing agricultural production cooperatives is to rely on poor peasants and firmly unite with middle peasants. Agricultural production cooperatives must not harm the interests of any poor peasant or middle peasant. In the advanced stage of developing agricultural production cooperatives, when major means of production have been collectivized and peasants have become prosperous, there will be no distinction between poor and middle peasants.

Article 3: The development of agricultural collectivization is divided into two stages: primary and advanced.

The primary stage cooperatives are of a semi-socialist nature. In this stage, the cooperative already has some collectively owned means of production. For the land and other means of production contributed by members for collective use, ownership remains with the members for a certain period, and members receive appropriate compensation.

As production develops and members' socialist consciousness improves, the cooperative gradually abolishes compensation for members' land. For other means of production contributed by members for collective use, the cooperative, with the members' consent, gradually turns them into collective ownership through compensation or other mutually beneficial methods. This way, the cooperative gradually transitions from the primary stage to the advanced stage.

Advanced stage cooperatives are of a fully socialist nature. In such cooperatives, members' land and other necessary means of production have been collectivized.

In both the primary and advanced stages of agricultural production cooperatives, members' personal belongings and small plots of land, scattered trees, poultry, livestock, small farm tools, and tools needed for operating family sideline businesses are not collectivized.

Article 4: Agricultural production cooperatives must continuously develop production, improve the level of agricultural production, increase members' labor efficiency, and raise the yield per unit area of crops.

The production of agricultural production cooperatives should be planned. The cooperative's production plan and product sales plan should be based on its specific conditions and should align with the state's production plan and procurement plan.

Based on the collective use of land and collective labor, agricultural production cooperatives should, as much as possible, use advanced agricultural production tools, continuously improve agricultural technology, and gradually, with the help of the state and the working class, achieve mechanization and electrification of agriculture.

Agricultural production cooperatives should adopt various measures to fully utilize the advantages of organized collective labor, launch labor competitions, encourage and require each member to work actively, and strive to create public and personal wealth.

Article 5: Agricultural production cooperatives should implement the principle of "distribution according to labor, more labor, more reward" for members' labor compensation.

Article 6: Agricultural production cooperatives are not allowed to engage in any form of exploitation. They are not allowed to hire long-term laborers, rent out land, lend money at interest, or engage in commercial exploitation. They are also not allowed to have members bring hired laborers into the cooperative.

Agricultural production cooperatives can hire technical personnel. In times of urgent production needs, they can also hire a small number of temporary laborers for assistance. Agricultural production cooperatives should provide reasonable treatment to those they hire.

Article 7: When handling all economic issues within the cooperative, agricultural production cooperatives should adhere to the principle of balancing public and private interests, ensuring that the interests of the state, the entire cooperative, and individual members are correctly combined.

Agricultural production cooperatives must model themselves on fulfilling their obligations to the state, paying agricultural taxes according to the quantity, quality, and time specified by the state, selling agricultural products according to the state's procurement plan, and selling agricultural products according to the pre-purchase contracts signed with state procurement agencies.

When distributing the results of labor, agricultural production cooperatives should reserve funds necessary for developing production and public cultural and welfare undertakings, and ensure that each member receives their due compensation.

Agricultural production cooperatives should, based on developing production, gradually improve members' material and cultural living standards.

Article 8: The internal life of agricultural production cooperatives should adhere to the principles of democracy, unity, and continuous progress.

Agricultural production cooperatives practice democratic management. All cooperative staff should closely connect with members, fully consult on matters, rely on the masses to run the cooperative well, and not abuse their power or suppress democracy.

Agricultural production cooperatives should adopt various effective methods to continuously strengthen unity within the cooperative, develop comradely friendship among members. No member is allowed to discriminate against minority nationalities, outsiders, new members, and female members.

Agricultural production cooperatives should adopt various effective methods to continuously improve members' political awareness, regularly conduct socialist and patriotic ideological education among members, ensure that members abide by the laws of the state, respond to the calls of the Communist Party and the people's government, and lead members to advance towards a socialist society.

Article 9: Agricultural production cooperatives should establish close ties with other agricultural production cooperatives and with supply and marketing cooperatives, credit cooperatives, handicraft cooperatives, and other cooperative organizations and state-owned economic agencies in rural areas to assist each other in implementing their economic plans and jointly strive to implement the state's economic plan.

Agricultural production cooperatives should strive to unite laboring peasants outside the cooperative (including those who have joined agricultural mutual aid teams and individual farmers), actively help them develop production and take the path of collectivization.

Article 10: Agricultural production cooperatives should launch struggles against rich peasants and other exploiters to restrict capitalist exploitation in rural areas and gradually eliminate it.

Chapter II: Members

Article 11: Any male or female laboring peasant who is 16 years old or above, or any other laborer (such as handicraft workers and accountants) who can participate in the cooperative's labor, can become a member of the agricultural production cooperative upon approval by the members' meeting after voluntarily applying.

When absorbing members, agricultural production cooperatives should adhere to the following regulations:

(1) Poor peasants should not be restricted from joining, and middle peasants should not be excluded.

(2) Demobilized soldiers, families of martyrs, families of soldiers, families of state cadres, and immigrants should be actively absorbed, and a planned effort should be made to absorb elderly, weak, and orphaned individuals who can participate in auxiliary labor.

(3) In the first few years after the cooperative is established, former landlords and rich peasants should not be accepted. Only after the cooperative has been consolidated and more than three-quarters of the laboring peasants in the county and township have joined the cooperative, can former landlords who have changed their class status according to the law, and rich peasants who have given up exploitation for many years, be individually accepted after being reviewed and approved by the members' meeting and the county-level people's committee.

(4) Those who have been deprived of political rights should not be accepted, but their family members are not subject to this restriction.

Article 12: Agricultural production cooperatives can accept individuals who do not meet the membership criteria but wish to participate in the cooperative's labor (such as those under 16 years old) and should compensate them for their labor according to the same standards as members.

Article 13: Each member has the following rights within the cooperative:

(1) To participate in the cooperative's labor and receive due compensation.

(2) To participate in cooperative affairs, propose and criticize matters related to cooperative affairs, and supervise cooperative affairs. To elect and be elected as cooperative leaders and to hold positions in the cooperative.

(3) To operate family sideline businesses without hindering participation in the cooperative's labor.

(4) To enjoy the benefits of various public undertakings organized by the cooperative.

Former landlords and rich peasants, after joining the cooperative, are not allowed to hold any important positions within the cooperative for a certain period.

Article 14: Each member has the following obligations within the cooperative:

(1) To abide by the cooperative's constitution and implement the resolutions of the members' meeting and the management committee.

(2) To abide by the cooperative's labor discipline and complete the assigned tasks on time.

(3) To cherish the property of the state, the collective property of the cooperative, and the private property of members that is used collectively by the cooperative.

(4) To strengthen the unity of the entire cooperative and resolutely fight against all activities that harm the cooperative.

Article 15: Members have the freedom to withdraw from the cooperative.

When members withdraw, they can take away the means of production that are still privately owned and withdraw the share capital fund and investment they have contributed. If the land has undergone significant construction by the cooperative and cannot be taken away, the cooperative should exchange it with equivalent land or pay appropriate compensation. If the land's quality has improved due to the cooperative's operations, or if the value of the farm tools and implements has increased due to the cooperative's repairs, the withdrawing member should also pay appropriate compensation to the cooperative.

Members who request to withdraw generally have to wait until the end of the production year to withdraw, to avoid disrupting the cooperative's production and to facilitate the settlement of accounts.

Article 16: If a member commits a serious crime and is deprived of political rights, the cooperative must expel them.

If a member seriously violates the cooperative's constitution or commits multiple major errors and does not repent after multiple educations and punishments, the cooperative can, after discussion and decision by the members' meeting, expel them. If the expelled person is dissatisfied, they can appeal to the county-level people's committee for resolution.

Expelling a member does not entail the expulsion of their family members who are also members.

The property of the expelled person within the cooperative is handled in the same way as that of a withdrawing member.

Chapter III: Land

Article 17: Members' land must be handed over to the agricultural production cooperative for collective use because the basic condition for the formation of the cooperative is to unite the land that members operate individually and manage it collectively in a reasonable and planned manner.

Members' special lands such as lotus ponds, fish ponds, and reed fields, if the area is relatively large and not suitable for individual operation, can, with the owner's consent, also be collectively operated by the cooperative.

To meet the needs of members for growing vegetables or other horticultural crops, members should be allowed to have small plots of private land. The size of each household's private land should be determined based on the number of household members and the amount of land in the village, but the land per person should not exceed 5% of the average land per person in the entire village.

Article 18: In the primary stage of the agricultural production cooperative, the cooperative should, based on the quantity and quality of the land contributed by members, pay members appropriate compensation from the annual income.

The income of the agricultural production cooperative is created by the labor of members, not by the ownership of land. Therefore, land compensation must be lower than agricultural labor compensation to encourage all members to actively participate in the cooperative's labor. However, in the initial stage of developing the agricultural production cooperative, land compensation should not be too low to attract peasants with more and better land to join the cooperative and to ensure that members with land but lacking labor power can obtain appropriate income.

In places with a lot of land and few people, even when the cooperative is first established, land compensation can be set lower or not given at all based on local customs. Conversely, in places with little land and many people, land compensation can be temporarily set equal to agricultural labor compensation with the approval of the provincial-level people's committee.

Article 19: Under the condition that members receive land compensation, agricultural taxes should be borne by members. If agricultural taxes are borne by the cooperative, members' land compensation should be correspondingly reduced.

Article 20: Land compensation should generally be fixed by the cooperative and should not increase with the development of the cooperative's production, so that the benefits of the cooperative's production development can be fully used for labor compensation and the accumulation of public property.

However, when the cooperative is first established, especially in places where land yield is unstable, if the cooperative is not confident in setting a fixed amount for land compensation, it can temporarily adopt a share-based compensation method or other appropriate transitional methods. Share-based compensation means, after deducting the current year's production costs, public accumulation fund, and public welfare fund from the actual harvest each year, allocating a certain percentage as land compensation and the remaining part as labor compensation.

After the amount or percentage of land compensation is set, it should not be reduced within a certain period and before production significantly increases, to avoid members with more and better land feeling disadvantaged and members with land but lacking labor power reducing their income.

The compensation for special lands such as lotus ponds, fish ponds, and reed fields should be set separately according to local customs.

Article 21: Land compensation should be calculated based on the yield that the land contributed by members can normally achieve in an average year. When assessing the yield of the land contributed by members, on the one hand, it should consider the quality of the land and the fact that many poor members' land originally could not achieve the expected yield, but after joining the cooperative, the yield can be improved. On the other hand, it should consider the actual yield of the land to ensure that members who improved the land quality before joining the cooperative receive their due compensation.

Article 22: Land rented or managed by members should generally be changed to be rented or managed by the cooperative. However, for individual poor members who rent land at a low rent or manage land for relatives, with the approval of the members' meeting, they can also receive appropriate compensation.

Members' privately owned wasteland can, with the owner's consent, be reclaimed by the cooperative, and no land compensation will be given for the first two to three years after reclamation.

Wasteland reclaimed by agricultural mutual aid teams will be used by the cooperative when the team members collectively join the cooperative. For individual team members who do not join, the cooperative can provide appropriate compensation.

Article 23: When members join the cooperative, if there are young crops on their land, they should be handed over to the cooperative for collective operation. The handling of the harvest from young crop land can adopt one of the following methods:

(1) The entire harvest belongs to the owner, and the owner compensates the cooperative for the costs incurred in collective operation. If this young crop land is harvested only once in a year, the owner should not receive land compensation. If it is harvested more than once, the owner should receive less land compensation.

(2) The harvest is collectively distributed by the cooperative, and the cooperative compensates the owner for the costs incurred in the young crop before joining the cooperative and pays land compensation.

(3) The harvest is handled separately according to the temporary distribution ratio of land compensation and labor compensation, with separate harvesting, threshing, and distribution.

Article 24: Water conservancy facilities such as ponds, wells, canals, and dams attached to members' land should be used by the cooperative along with the land and should be maintained and repaired by the cooperative.

If such water conservancy facilities are old, they have already increased the yield of the land before members joined the cooperative and the land compensation after joining, the cooperative generally does not need to pay additional compensation to the owner. If such water conservancy facilities can irrigate other lands after being handed over to the cooperative, the cooperative should pay appropriate compensation to the owner based on the irrigation benefits and local customs. If such water conservancy facilities are newly built, the owner has not yet obtained appropriate benefits, and requests the cooperative to purchase them with the cooperative's consent, the cooperative can appropriately compensate the owner for the costs incurred and turn them into collective property. The amount to be paid should be paid in installments over a few years; the interest issue before full payment should be resolved through consultation between the cooperative and the owner.

Chapter IV: Major Means of Production Other Than Land

Article 25: Major means of production other than land that the cooperative needs should be collectively used or collectively operated by the cooperative, with appropriate compensation to the owner, and gradually turned into collective ownership with the owner's consent. The specific scope and methods of collective use or collective operation of these means of production, the methods of compensating the owner, and the time and methods of collectivization should be handled separately according to the nature of the means of production. The means of production mentioned in this chapter include the following three categories:

(1) Draft animals (horses, oxen, mules, donkeys, etc. used for plowing), large farm tools (plows, modern plows, horse-drawn farm tools, water wheels, windmills, water pumps, etc.), and agricultural transportation tools (carts, boats, etc.). These means of production are indispensable for agricultural production and should be collectively used by the cooperative first.

(2) Large areas of trees and herds of livestock (livestock raised or grazed in groups). These means of production are closely related to agriculture and should generally be gradually collectively operated by the cooperative.

(3) Large sideline tools and equipment. These means of production have a less fixed relationship with agriculture, and the cooperative only needs to collectively use a part of them.

Article 26: The cooperative can handle members' privately owned draft animals in the following three ways:

(1) The draft animals are still privately owned by members and fed by themselves, and the cooperative rents them at the normal local rent (private ownership, private feeding, collective use). This method is generally suitable for newly established cooperatives.

The draft animals rented by the cooperative can be used by the owner, rented to others, or lent to others when the cooperative does not need them. However, if the owner sells these draft animals, they must obtain the cooperative's consent.

If the cooperative, due to improper management during the rental period, causes the death or disability of members' draft animals, it should compensate the owner appropriately.

(2) The draft animals are still privately owned by members but are collectively fed and used by the cooperative, with appropriate compensation to the owner (private ownership, collective feeding, collective use).

The offspring of collectively fed draft animals can be shared between the cooperative and the owner or can belong entirely to the owner or the cooperative. The handling method should be set according to local customs.

If the cooperative, due to improper management, causes the death or disability of members' draft animals, it should compensate the owner appropriately.

(3) The cooperative purchases members' draft animals at the normal local price and turns them into collective property. This method is one that all cooperatives must adopt after operating for a certain period. Some cooperatives, although they have not been operating for long, have the strength to purchase and feed draft animals and can also adopt this method.

To balance the burden on members and the interests of the owner, the cooperative should pay the purchase price of draft animals to the owner in installments over an appropriate period, generally three years, and no more than five years. The interest issue of the unpaid price should be resolved through consultation between the cooperative and the owner.

Draft animals collectively owned by agricultural mutual aid teams will be turned into collective property when the team members collectively join the cooperative. For individual team members who do not join, the cooperative can provide appropriate compensation.

Article 27: The cooperative can rent members' privately owned large farm tools and agricultural transportation tools based on production needs. The rental compensation should be set based on the value of these items at the time of the first rental and the number of years they can be used. If the rented farm tools and agricultural transportation tools are damaged, the cooperative should be responsible for repairs. If the damage is severe and cannot be repaired, the cooperative should compensate for it. Small farm tools (such as sickles and hoes) should be provided and repaired by members themselves.

Article 28: The cooperative can purchase members' privately owned large farm tools and agricultural transportation tools that are frequently needed, turning them into collective property according to the method of purchasing draft animals. Large farm tools and agricultural transportation tools collectively owned by agricultural mutual aid teams will be handled according to the method of handling collectively owned draft animals when the team members collectively join the cooperative.

Article 29: Members' privately owned trees should be handled according to the following principles and separately according to different situations:

(1) Scattered trees should be privately owned and operated by members themselves.

(2) Trees that require a constant large amount of labor, such as orchards, tea mountains, mulberry fields, paulownia mountains, and bamboo groves, should be collectively operated by the cooperative, with the cooperative paying reasonable compensation. The compensation should be set based on the size of the income and the difficulty of operation, considering the costs incurred by the owner before and the costs that the cooperative will incur in the future.

(3) Trees with less labor and more income, such as pine forests and cypress forests, can, with the owner's consent, also be collectively operated by the cooperative. The income obtained by the cooperative from operating these trees, after deducting the costs (protection, felling, transportation, etc.) and the appropriate benefits, should be given to the owner.

(4) Newly planted young trees should be collectively operated by the cooperative. The compensation that the owner should receive can be paid when there is income. If the owner agrees, young trees can also be purchased by the cooperative at the cost incurred by the owner, turning them into collective property. After young trees are turned into collective property, the land compensation issue should be handled by the cooperative according to local customs.

Article 30: In agricultural production cooperatives where livestock farming is not the main focus, members' privately owned livestock should generally still be privately owned and operated by members themselves. If the number of livestock is very large and the cooperative has suitable conditions for developing livestock farming, with the agreement of both the cooperative and the owner, it can also be collectively operated by the cooperative. The compensation that the owner should receive should be set according to local customs.

If members request the cooperative to purchase their livestock, the cooperative can purchase it with the agreement of both parties, turning it into collective property.

Article 31: Members' large sideline tools and equipment should be handled according to the nature of the sideline business. If the sideline business is suitable for family operation, the tools and equipment should be privately owned by members. If the sideline business is suitable for collective operation by the cooperative, the tools and equipment can be handled according to the method of handling members' privately owned large farm tools.

Chapter V: Share Capital Fund

Article 32: Agricultural production cooperatives need to collect share capital funds from members to prepare for production expenses such as seeds, fertilizers, and fodder, and to purchase members' draft animals, farm tools, and other means of production. Funds used for production expenses are called production expense share capital funds; funds used to purchase members' draft animals, farm tools, and other means of production are called collectivization share capital funds.

Share capital funds are generally allocated among members based on the land they contribute when joining. If members' land compensation is relatively low, a portion can also be allocated based on labor power; if land compensation is very low or non-existent, it should be entirely allocated based on labor power. If the collected share capital funds are used for livestock farming, forestry, or sideline production, separate allocation methods can be specified.

Poor members who genuinely cannot pay the share capital funds can apply to the bank (either personally or through the cooperative) for loans from the poor peasants' cooperative fund to pay off the funds.

The share capital funds paid by members are recorded in their names, do not accrue interest, and can only be withdrawn when members withdraw from the cooperative.

Article 33: The production expense share capital funds that members should pay should roughly be equivalent to the cost of seeds, fertilizers, fodder, etc. used by an average peasant in one year on similar land.

Production expense share capital funds are calculated in cash, but members can pay with goods.

Production expense share capital funds should generally be paid in full when members join the cooperative. However, the fodder item should not be paid until the cooperative has collectively fed or collectively owned draft animals.

Article 34: The collectivization share capital funds that members should pay should, in principle, be equivalent to the price of the draft animals, farm tools, and other means of production purchased by the cooperative from members. If this amount is too large and many members cannot afford it, the collectivization share capital funds cannot be set according to this amount but should only be equivalent to a large part or a part of the price. In this case, the remaining part of the price should be paid by the cooperative from the public accumulation fund.

Members who sell draft animals, farm tools, and other means of production to the cooperative can use the price that the cooperative should pay them to offset the collectivization share capital funds they should pay, with excess refunded and deficit supplemented; that is, after offsetting, the excess part should be refunded by the cooperative to the member, and the deficit part should be supplemented by the member to the cooperative.

The deadline for members to pay the collectivization share capital funds is the same as the deadline for the cooperative to pay the price to the owner of draft animals, farm tools, and other means of production, generally three years, and no more than five years. Before members pay the collectivization share capital funds, the interest on the price owed by the cooperative to the owner should be paid by the cooperative from the public accumulation fund.

Article 35: When the members of an agricultural mutual aid team collectively join the cooperative and turn their collective property into the cooperative's collective property, the share capital funds they should pay should be appropriately reduced.

Article 36: When the funds of the agricultural production cooperative are insufficient, members should invest in the cooperative according to their abilities. The cooperative should repay members' investments within one to three years.

The interest that the cooperative pays to members for their cash investments should generally be equivalent to the interest on deposits in credit cooperatives. The interest that the cooperative pays to members for their goods investments can be set according to local customs, either lower than the interest on cash investments or not accruing interest.

Article 37: Agricultural production cooperatives have the right to purchase members' family-stored fertilizers at reasonable prices. The price of fertilizers can be paid after the harvest, without accruing interest.

Chapter VI: Production

Article 38: Agricultural production cooperatives should, based on their economic conditions and local natural conditions, actively adopt the following measures to improve the level of agricultural production:

(1) Reasonably use arable land (planting suitable crops according to the land conditions, reasonable rotation and intercropping of various crops, increasing the area of double-cropping according to possible conditions, and expanding the area of high-yield crops, etc.).

(2) Develop small-scale water conservancy projects (digging ponds, drilling wells, building dams, digging canals, repairing dikes, building fences, building small reservoirs, etc.), increasing paddy fields, expanding the area of irrigation, and improving irrigation methods.

(3) Use modern farm tools and master the technology of using modern farm tools.

### Chapter Five: Increasing Production

(IV) Protect and Breed Draft Animals (Establish a system for feeding and using draft animals, prevent poor feeding and overuse, prevent and treat animal diseases, actively breed draft animals, improve animal breeds, etc.), develop animal husbandry.

(V) Improve Crop Varieties (Implement seed selection, retention, replacement, and cultivation of superior varieties, etc.).

(VI) Increase Fertilizer and Apply Fertilizer Reasonably (Make full use of various natural and artificial fertilizers, encourage members to accumulate fertilizer, improve fertilization methods, etc.).

(VII) Improve Cultivation Methods (Deep plowing and fine tillage, adopt advanced methods for seed treatment and seedling cultivation, timely sowing, appropriate planting density, strengthen field management, etc.), prevent and control pests and diseases, and fight against various natural disasters.

(VIII) Improve Farmland, Improve Soil, Protect and Plant Forests, Cultivate and Protect Grasslands, and Implement Comprehensive Water and Soil Conservation Measures for Agriculture, Forestry, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries.

(IX) Under the condition of not affecting water and soil conservation, open up wasteland, and under possible conditions, organize migrant settlement and land reclamation.

(X) Utilize barren mountains to develop forestry, utilize water flow to develop fisheries. Each agricultural production cooperative should strive to find the most critical ways to increase production for the cooperative and implement them with the greatest effort.

Article 39: Under the condition of not affecting agricultural production and not engaging in commercial speculation, agricultural production cooperatives should, according to needs and possibilities, actively engage in sideline production, gradually develop a diversified economy combining agriculture with handicrafts, transportation, animal husbandry, fisheries, and forestry, in order to tap the potential of the cooperative, help the development of agriculture and the entire rural economy.

Under the condition of not affecting the cooperative's production, agricultural production cooperatives should encourage and help members engage in sideline production suitable for decentralized management.

Article 40: Agricultural production cooperatives should mobilize all male and female members to actively participate in the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production. The cooperative should do its best to help female members overcome obstacles and difficulties in participating in production, and pay attention to their strengths and characteristics when assigning production tasks.

Article 41: Agricultural production cooperatives should actively promote and organize members to study scientific knowledge and production technology, reward members for their innovations in production. The cooperative should cooperate with agricultural scientific institutions and agricultural technology promotion stations to improve the technical level of members, train the cooperative's technical personnel, and actively promote various advanced experiences according to specific conditions.

Article 42: Agricultural production cooperatives, in order to carry out production planning, gradually implement the various production development tasks stipulated in this chapter, and make their production compatible with the requirements of the state, should formulate the annual production plan at the end of autumn or winter each year.

The annual production plan should gradually include the following contents: sowing plan and yield plan; labor and animal power utilization plan; supply plan for production materials; basic construction plan; sideline production plan.

To ensure the completion of the annual production plan, the cooperative should formulate a plan for one season or one segment according to the local agricultural seasons or farming stages, specifically stipulating the production tasks and deadlines for completion.

To make the annual production plan have a long-term plan as a basis and make the cooperative's activities adapt to the needs of all aspects of rural development, the cooperative should formulate a long-term plan of three years or more, comprehensively planning the tasks of various productions and constructions during this period.

### Chapter Seven: Labor Organization and Labor Discipline

Article 43: Agricultural production cooperatives, in order to carry out organized collective labor, must, according to the needs of production and the conditions of the members, implement labor division and establish a certain labor organization, gradually implement the responsibility system in production.

The cooperative, in order to implement the responsibility system in agricultural production, should divide the members into several production teams, take the production team as the basic form of labor organization, and let each production team, under the guidance of the cooperative's production plan, arrange the production for a period of time and each day.

The production team can, according to needs, divide into temporary production groups. Small-scale cooperatives can only divide into production groups without setting up production teams.

The cooperative should appoint or assign people to be responsible for the positions of accountant, technician, livestock keeper, and custodian. Cooperatives with a large number of public livestock can set up a special production team or production group responsible for feeding livestock.

Cooperatives with large-scale sideline production can, according to needs, set up a special production team or production group responsible for sideline production.

The production team has a team leader, and the production group has a group leader, who is responsible for the production work of the entire team or group.

Article 44: When the cooperative assigns members to field production teams, it should generally make the teams similar in terms of the number of laborers, technical level, leadership strength, and distance from the residence, all of which should be convenient for independent operation; when assigning tasks to each production team, it should make appropriate arrangements so that each team can always have work.

Article 45: The organization of the production team should be a permanent one. However, it can also be an organization for one farming stage or one season at the beginning, in order to gain experience and gradually transition to a permanent organization.

After the field production team has a permanent organization, the land that each team is responsible for, the draft animals and tools used, should gradually become permanent, so that each team can be responsible for managing the land allocated to it, responsible for protecting the draft animals and tools allocated to it, can make its own production plan, and be responsible for completing its own production tasks.

After the field production team has a permanent organization, the cooperative can still make necessary adjustments and temporary transfers of the team's personnel, draft animals, and tools.

Article 46: The team leader or group leader should pay attention to correctly assigning the labor tasks of each person in the unit, fully utilizing the advantages of organized collective labor to improve production efficiency; and should try to make every person (especially the elderly, weak, sick, and disabled members) be able to contribute their strength and obtain a certain income from labor.

Within the possible range, the team leader or group leader should assign each person a specific section or job to be responsible for, thoroughly implementing the responsibility system in production.

Article 47: The team leader or group leader should, after each day's work is completed, check the work performance of each person in the unit and, based on the work quota, record the number of labor days each person should receive. If the cooperative has not yet set work quotas, the team leader or group leader should, within a certain period, convene the team members or group members to, based on each person's work situation, democratically evaluate the remuneration each person should receive.

The cooperative's director, deputy director, and other responsible personnel should regularly and plannedly check the work of the production teams and production groups.

Article 48: Members of agricultural production cooperatives, except in special cases with the approval of the members' meeting, must complete a certain number of labor days in the cooperative each year.

Article 49: Members of agricultural production cooperatives should abide by labor discipline. Labor discipline must include the following items: (1) not absenting oneself from work without reason; (2) listening to commands during work; (3) ensuring the quality of labor; (4) protecting public property.

Members who violate labor discipline should be educated and criticized; if the offense is serious, appropriate penalties such as deducting labor days, compensating for losses, removing positions, or even expelling from the cooperative should be imposed.

### Chapter Eight: Labor Remuneration

Article 50: Agricultural production cooperatives should, based on the principle of "distribution according to work" and "more work, more pay," gradually implement the piecework system, and unconditionally implement equal pay for equal work for men and women.

To implement the piecework system, it is necessary to set different quotas and remuneration standards for different types of work.

For a certain type of work, under certain conditions of land, draft animals, tools, weather, etc., the amount and quality that a person of average labor capacity can achieve in one day is the quota for that type of work. The cooperative must gradually and correctly set the quotas for all types of work in the cooperative. The quota should not be set too low, so that most members can easily exceed it; nor should it be set too high, so that most members cannot reach it. If the originally set quota is too low or too high, or if the labor conditions have changed, the quota should be appropriately adjusted.

The remuneration for completing the quota for each type of work is calculated in labor days. One labor day is equal to ten work points. The number of labor days for completing the quota for each type of work should be evaluated based on the technical level required for each type of work, the degree of hardship in the labor process, and the importance of that type of work in the overall production. Completing a quota for an average type of work should be recorded as one labor day.

The cooperative must correctly evaluate the number of labor days for completing the quota for each type of work. The number of labor days obtained for completing the quotas for various types of work should have an appropriate difference, which should neither be too small nor too large. On the one hand, it should prevent egalitarianism and make sure that members engaged in difficult work do not suffer a loss; on the other hand, it should not make the remuneration standards for some types of work too high, so that everyone rushes to do them, or too low, so that no one is willing to do them.

Article 51: Before setting the quotas and remuneration standards for various types of work, the cooperative can temporarily adopt the "fixed distribution and flexible evaluation" method, evaluating a certain number of work points for each member based on the strength of their labor capacity and technical level, and then, based on their actual labor situation, conducting evaluations, adding points for good work and subtracting points for poor work, as the number of labor days they receive for that day. However, this method not only takes time but also cannot correctly calculate the remuneration for each member's actual labor, so the cooperative must quickly set the quotas and remuneration standards for various types of work to overcome the confusion in labor remuneration and avoid losses in production.

Article 52: How much a labor day can be divided into depends on the total income of the cooperative for the year. Generally speaking, the total income of the cooperative for the year, after deducting production costs, public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and land remuneration, is divided by the total number of labor days for the year, and the result is the amount that each labor day should receive. The more income the cooperative has for the year, the more each labor day receives; the less income the cooperative has for the year, the less each labor day receives. Therefore, each member, in order to obtain more income, should not only actively work to obtain more labor days but also strive to increase the overall income of the cooperative, so that the amount that each labor day can receive increases. In this way, the personal interests of the members and the collective interests of the cooperative are correctly combined.

Article 53: For members of the cooperative who cannot participate in production labor due to participating in cooperative affairs, the cooperative can, by a resolution of the members' meeting, based on the amount of work they undertake and the quality of their work, supplement them with an appropriate number of labor days each year. The supplement for the director of the cooperative, plus the labor days he obtains from participating in production labor, should generally be higher than the average number of labor days obtained by the average labor force in the cooperative. The remuneration for the accountant and the director of a large-scale cooperative, if they must leave production labor, should also be decided by the members' meeting; this remuneration should generally be equivalent to or higher than the average number of labor days obtained by the average labor force.

Article 54: Members who receive substitute farming benefits, such as the families of martyrs and military personnel, can have the labor days completed by the substitute farmers (whether or not they are members) recorded as their own labor days. Members who receive substitute farming fees, if they and the cooperative both agree, can also hand over the substitute farming fees to the cooperative, which will then record an equivalent number of labor days.

Article 55: In order to combine the piecework system in labor remuneration with the responsibility system in labor organization, agricultural production cooperatives should implement the contract system, that is, assign a certain production task to the production team, pre-calculate a certain number of labor days based on the work quota (if the cooperative has not yet set work quotas, it can, based on local contract practices, agree on a certain number of labor days), and have the production team complete it within a limited time. The production team, whether it uses less labor time due to high labor efficiency or more labor time due to low labor efficiency, will receive the same number of labor days.

If the quality of the production team's work does not meet the requirements, the cooperative can require it to redo the work or appropriately deduct the number of labor days it should receive. If the production team's work time exceeds the deadline, the cooperative can also appropriately deduct the number of labor days it should receive. If the production team overcomes special difficulties and achieves special results in production, the cooperative should appropriately increase the number of labor days.

The number of labor days obtained by the production team implementing the contract system should be distributed to the team members based on the actual completion of the work quota by each member. If the cooperative has not yet set work quotas, it can temporarily adopt the method of democratic evaluation to evaluate the number of labor days each member should receive.

Article 56: Agricultural production cooperatives should, from implementing the contract system for farming stages and seasons (small contracts), gradually transition to implementing the annual contract system (large contracts).

When implementing the annual contract system, the production plan for the agricultural products that the production team must complete and the supply plan for production materials that the cooperative management committee must be responsible for should be set, and the overproduction reward system should be implemented. For production teams that have exceeded the production plan, the cooperative should appropriately increase the number of labor days as a reward; for production teams that have not managed well and whose production is less than 90% of the planned amount, the cooperative can also appropriately deduct labor days as a penalty. If there are unforeseen disasters during the contract period, the production plan should be adjusted according to the degree of the disaster.

Article 57: Agricultural production cooperatives should reward units and individuals that have won in labor competitions, and units and individuals that have made special contributions in production technology and production management. Agricultural production cooperatives, due to good leadership, have exceeded the cooperative's production plan, and the personnel responsible for the cooperative's affairs should also receive appropriate rewards.

### Chapter Nine: Financial Management and Distribution

Article 58: The cooperative management committee should formulate the annual budget at the same time as the annual production plan, that is, the financial income and expenditure plan, and submit it to the members' meeting for review and approval.

The cooperative's budget should include: the source of funds (including physical and monetary assets) and the plan for the use of funds for the year; the estimated total value of production (including physical and monetary assets obtained from agricultural and sideline production) for the year and the estimated distribution.

Article 59: The main sources of funds for agricultural production cooperatives are: the share capital contributed by members; income from production; investment by members. When necessary, the cooperative can apply for loans from banks or credit cooperatives.

Article 60: The use of funds by agricultural production cooperatives must strictly adhere to the principle of thrift and avoid waste. The amount of production expenses (including the cost of seeds, fodder, and internal fertilizer, the cost of purchasing fertilizer and pesticides from outside, the cost of repairing tools and treating draft animals, the remuneration for renting members' draft animals and tools, production management expenses, etc.) in the annual budget should be set according to the specific conditions of each place and each cooperative, and should not be too high or too low. The limit for each item of production expenses should be set, and the limit for production management expenses should not exceed 1% of the total production value for the year.

The cooperative should educate and supervise its personnel to practice thrift in the use of funds and should educate and supervise all members to protect public property and prevent the waste and loss of public property.

Article 61: Agricultural production cooperatives, in order to avoid the waste and loss of funds, should establish necessary financial systems.

General expenditures within the budget must be approved by the director of the management committee. Large expenditures within the budget must be approved by the management committee. Additional budgets must be reviewed and approved by the members' meeting. The accountant has the right to refuse any expenditure that does not comply with the system and procedures.

All income and expenditure of the cooperative must be supported by vouchers, and the accountant must record accounts based on vouchers. Accounting and cashiering should gradually be done by different people: the accountant is responsible for accounting but not for money, and the cashier is responsible for money but not for accounting. The cashier has no right to pay any amount of money on their own.

All public property of the cooperative must be managed by a designated person, and methods for registration, management, and regular inventory should be established.

If a member of the cooperative embezzles, steals, or damages public property, or causes significant loss of public property due to negligence, they must compensate for it and receive appropriate punishment; if the offense is serious, the cooperative should request the judicial authorities to handle it.

Article 62: The accounts of agricultural production cooperatives must be published on time. The number of labor days each member receives should be published monthly and by production season. Financial expenditures should be published monthly and annually. The inventory of public property should be published at the end of the year.

The cooperative's supervisory committee must regularly check the various accounts of the cooperative.

Article 63: Agricultural production cooperatives, in the entire year's production, have the following two methods of distribution for the physical and monetary assets obtained:

(1) In the case where members' families are responsible for paying agricultural taxes, delivering state-mandated agricultural products, and selling agricultural products to purchasing agencies, the distribution should be carried out in the following order:
1. Deduct the various expenditures in this year's production and leave them for next year's production expenses.
2. Reserve a certain amount of public accumulation funds and public welfare funds.
3. Pay remuneration for members' land, trees, and livestock, and pay rent for rented land.
4. Distribute members' labor remuneration according to the total labor days of agricultural production, sideline production, and cooperative affairs.

(2) In the case where the cooperative is responsible for paying agricultural taxes, delivering state-mandated agricultural products, and selling agricultural products to purchasing agencies, the cooperative should first fulfill the above-mentioned obligations to the state, and then distribute the remaining physical and monetary assets and the monetary assets obtained from delivering and selling agricultural products according to the order listed in the previous item.

Cooperatives that implement the first method should actively prepare to implement the second method.

Article 64: The use of public accumulation funds is limited to the basic construction of the cooperative (such as purchasing draft animals, tools, and sideline tools, improving land, conserving water and soil, building small-scale water conservancy projects, reclaiming wasteland, afforestation, etc.) and increasing production expenses, and cannot be used for other purposes. The amount of public accumulation funds, when the cooperative is first established, generally should not exceed 5% of the cooperative's actual income (total production value minus various expenditures in production) for the year, and can gradually be increased to 10% as production develops. However, in cooperatives that operate technical crops, the public accumulation funds can be slightly increased.

The use of public welfare funds is limited to the development of the cooperative's cultural undertakings and public welfare undertakings, and cannot be used for other purposes. The amount of public welfare funds, when the cooperative is first established, generally can account for 1% of the cooperative's actual income for the year, and can gradually be increased to 2% or 3% as production develops.

Article 65: In years of good harvest, the public accumulation funds and public welfare funds of agricultural production cooperatives can be appropriately increased. In years of disaster, the public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and members' land remuneration should be appropriately reduced, and the cooperative's external loans and members' investments can be requested by the cooperative to be postponed for repayment. If next year's production expenses cannot be left enough, they can be made up after next year's harvest.

Article 66: Agricultural products harvested in the spring and summer, after the cooperative retains the necessary portion, should be distributed to members according to the number of labor days they have received, while also considering the actual needs of the members, and distributed in advance. The final settlement should be made at the end of the production year.

The cooperative's monetary income, after the cooperative retains the necessary portion, can also be allowed to be advanced to members (especially those in difficulty) according to their actual needs, and the final settlement should be made at the end of the production year. Members' advances generally should not exceed the remuneration they are expected to receive for the labor days they have completed.

Article 67: The combination of physical and monetary assets distributed to members, as well as the combination of various physical assets, should take into full consideration the actual needs of the members. For products within the scope of state-mandated purchase and sale, if there is surplus or shortage among members, the cooperative should make adjustments.

Article 68: Public accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and all other public property accumulated by the cooperative must not be dispersed. Members who withdraw from the cooperative can only take away the production materials that are still their private property and withdraw the share capital and investments they have contributed, and cannot take away any of the public property accumulated by the cooperative. When two or more cooperatives merge, it is not allowed for any cooperative to take away all the public property accumulated before the merger.

Cooperatives that have already accumulated public property, when accepting new members, should, in addition to requiring them to contribute the share capital they should contribute, not make any additional demands on them.

### Chapter Ten: Political Work and Cultural and Welfare Undertakings

Article 69: Agricultural production cooperatives should, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the assistance of the Communist Youth League and the Women's Federation, carry out political work in the cooperative.

The political work in the cooperative includes the following contents:
1. Explain domestic and international events to members, propagate the Party's proposals and the government's policies, especially emphasizing the propaganda of the road to socialist transformation of agriculture and various rural work policies, and call on members to love the motherland, observe state laws, consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, and build socialism.
2. Promote the love for the cooperative and public property, promote thrift in running the cooperative, and love the cooperative as one's own home.
3. Educate members to voluntarily abide by labor discipline and oppose behaviors that violate labor discipline.
4. Carry out labor competitions, promote the study and improvement of production technology, encourage members to be active and creative in labor, strive to increase production and income.
5. Promote democracy within the cooperative, encourage members to actively participate in the management of cooperative affairs, and strive to improve the work of the cooperative.
6. Carry out collective education, strengthen the unity of all members, production teams, cooperatives, and external laboring peasants, and promote mutual assistance and mutual aid in life. In areas where different ethnic groups live together, special attention should be paid to the education of unity, mutual assistance, and mutual respect for customs and habits among ethnic groups.
7. Improve members' revolutionary vigilance and strengthen the cooperative's defense work.

Article 70: Agricultural production cooperatives should actively mobilize, organize, and help members to eliminate illiteracy, study culture and science. The cooperative should plan and carry out cultural, recreational, and sports activities to improve the cultural life of members.

Article 71: Agricultural production cooperatives must pay attention to the safety of members in labor. When assigning labor tasks, attention should be paid to the physical condition of members.

The cooperative should provide medical treatment and assistance to members who are injured on duty; the cooperative should provide relief to the families of members who die on duty.

Article 72: Agricultural production cooperatives should, with the development of production, gradually develop the following welfare undertakings:
1. Carry out public health work and family health work for members.
2. Organize childcare centers during busy farming seasons to solve the difficulties of female members.
3. Provide assistance to female members when they give birth.
4. Provide assistance to members who encounter unfortunate accidents and have serious difficulties in life.

### Chapter Eleven: Management Structure

Article 73: The highest management organ of agricultural production cooperatives is the members' meeting.

The members' meeting elects the management committee to manage cooperative affairs, elects the supervisory committee to supervise cooperative affairs, and elects the director of the cooperative to lead daily work.

The director of the cooperative serves as the director of the management committee and represents the cooperative externally.

Article 74: The members' meeting has the following powers:
1. To adopt and amend the cooperative charter.
2. To elect and remove the director of the cooperative, members of the management committee, the director and members of the supervisory committee.
3. To decide on the remuneration for land and other major means of production entering the cooperative, the collection of share capital, and the distribution of annual income.
4. To review and approve the production plan and budget submitted by the management committee, the quotas for various types of work and the number of labor days for completing the quotas for various types of work, and important contracts signed with external parties.
5. To review and approve the work reports of the management committee and the supervisory committee.
6. To approve the admission of new members.
7. To decide on major rewards and major punishments for members and to decide on the expulsion of members.
8. To decide on other major matters within the cooperative.

The members' meeting, when exercising the powers listed in items (1), (2), (3), (4), and when deciding on the expulsion of members, must have the attendance of two-thirds of the members, and the approval of more than half of the attending members to make a decision; when exercising other powers, it must have the attendance of more than half of the members, and the approval of more than half of the attending members to make a decision.

Article 75: The members' meeting is convened by the management committee and should be held at least once every quarter.

Article 76: When the number of members in the cooperative is too large, or the places of residence are too scattered, making it difficult to convene a members' meeting, with the approval of the county-level people's committee, the members' representative meeting can be held to exercise the powers of the members' meeting.

The number of representatives and the method of their election for the members' representative meeting should be proposed by the management committee and approved by the county-level people's committee. To facilitate the reflection of the opinions of all members, the number of representatives for the members' representative meeting should not be too small, generally not less than one hundred.

The members' representative meeting, when exercising the powers listed in Article 74, items (1), (2), (3), (4), and when deciding on the expulsion of members, must have the approval of two-thirds of all representatives to make a decision; when exercising other powers, it must have the approval of more than half of all representatives to make a decision.

Article 77: The management committee of the cooperative manages cooperative affairs according to the cooperative charter and the resolutions of the members' meeting.

The management committee generally consists of five to fifteen members. The members of the management committee can be divided into agricultural production management, technical management, sideline production management, financial management, political work, and cultural and welfare undertakings according to their responsibilities.

When necessary, the management committee can elect one to several deputy directors to assist the director in his work.

Article 78: The management committee of the cooperative can, according to needs, appoint cooperative personnel.

The management committee appoints team leaders and direct production group leaders, and should seek the agreement of team members or group members. The leaders of production groups below the team level are appointed by the team leader.

Article 79: The supervisory committee of the cooperative supervises the director and members of the management committee to abide by the cooperative charter and the resolutions of the members' meeting, checks whether the cooperative's financial income and expenditure are correct, and checks whether there are any cases of embezzlement, theft, damage, waste, or loss of public property within the cooperative. The supervisory committee should report its work to the members' meeting regularly and can also propose opinions to the management committee at any time.

The supervisory committee generally consists of three to nine members. When necessary, the supervisory committee can elect one to two deputy directors to assist the director in his work.

The director, members of the management committee, accountant, cashier, and custodian of the cooperative cannot hold positions in the supervisory committee.

Article 80: The director, members of the management committee, and members of the supervisory committee of the cooperative are elected annually and can be re-elected. When the cooperative is rapidly expanding, attention should be paid to absorbing active elements from new members to participate in the management structure.

In the leadership and personnel of the cooperative, female members should occupy a certain number of positions.

If the members of the cooperative have different ethnic compositions, the members of each ethnic group should occupy an appropriate proportion in the leadership and personnel of the cooperative.

### Chapter Twelve: Supplementary Provisions

Article 81: The establishment of agricultural production cooperatives should be registered with the county, city, or district people's committee. When registering, the cooperative charter, the list of members, and the list of management committee members should be submitted to the registration authority.

Article 82: These regulations are mainly applicable to primary-level agricultural production cooperatives.

Cooperatives that have transitioned to the advanced stage should, based on the fact that land and other major means of production have been publicized, formulate a cooperative charter in accordance with these regulations and submit it to the registration authority for approval.

    农业生产合作社示范章程草案
    （一九五五年十一月九日全国人民代表大会常务委员会第二十四次会议通过）
    目　次
    第一章　总则
    第二章　社员
    第三章　土地
    第四章　土地以外的主要生产资料
    第五章　股份基金
    第六章　生产
    第七章　劳动组织和劳动纪律

    第十一章　管理机构
    第十二章　附则
    第一章　总则
    第一条　农业生产合作社是劳动农民的集体经济组织，是农民在共产党和人民政府的领导和帮助下，按照自愿和互利的原则组织起来的；它统一地使用社员的土地、耕畜、农具等主要生产资料，并且逐步地把这些生产资料公有化；它组织社员进行共同的劳动，统一地分配社员的共同劳动的成果。
    发展农业生产合作社的目的，是要逐步地消灭农村中的资本主义的剥削制度，克服小农经济的落后性，发展社会主义的农业经济，适应社会主义工业化的需要。这就是说，要逐步地用生产资料的劳动群众集体所有制代替生产资料的私人所有制，逐步地用大规模的、机械化的生产代替小生产，使农业高度地发展起来，使全体农民共同富裕起来，使社会对于农产品的不断增长的需要得到满足。
    第二条　农业合作化是使劳动农民永远摆脱贫穷和剥削的唯一的光明道路，因此，农业生产合作社应该逐步地吸收全体劳动农民入社，使社会主义在农村中得到完全的胜利。农业生产合作社要达到这个目的，决不能用强迫的方法，应该用劝说的方法，并且作出榜样，使没有入社的农民认识到入社只有好处，不会吃亏，因而自愿地入社。
    农业生产合作社应该是劳动农民互相有利的联合，特别是贫农和中农互相有利的联合。只有在互利的基础上才能保证农民自愿地走合作化的道路。农业生产合作社的发展原则是依靠贫农，巩固地联合中农。农业生产合作社必须不损害任何贫农的利益，也不损害任何中农的利益。在农业生产合作社发展的高级阶段，主要生产资料已经公有化，农民已经共同富裕起来，那时候将没有贫农和中农的区别。
    第三条　农业生产合作化的发展，分做初级和高级两个阶段。
    初级阶段的合作社属于半社会主义的性质。在这个阶段，合作社已经有一部分公有的生产资料；对于社员交来统一使用的土地和别的生产资料，在一定的期间还保留社员的所有权，并且给社员以适当的报酬。
    随着生产的发展和社员的社会主义觉悟的提高，合作社对于社员的土地逐步地取消报酬；对于社员交来统一使用的别的生产资料，按照本身的需要，得到社员的同意，用付给代价的办法或者别的互利的办法，陆续地转为全社公有，也就是全体社员集体所有。这样，合作社就由初级阶段逐步地过渡到高级阶段。
    高级阶段的合作社属于完全的社会主义的性质。在这种合作社里，社员的土地和合作社所需要的别的生产资料，都已经公有化了。
    无论在农业生产合作社的初级阶段或者高级阶段，社员所有的生活资料和小块园地、零星树木、家禽、家畜、小农具、经营家庭副业所需要的工具，都不实行公有化。
    第四条　农业生产合作社必须不断地发展生产，提高农业生产的水平，提高社员的劳动效率和农作物的单位面积产量。
    农业生产合作社的生产要有计划。合作社的生产计划和产品销售计划要根据本身的具体条件，同时要适应国家的生产计划和收购计划。
    农业生产合作社在统一使用土地和共同劳动的基础上，要尽可能地使用进步的农业生产工具，不断地改进农业技术，逐步地在国家和工人阶级的帮助下，实现农业的机械化和电气化。
    农业生产合作社要采取各种办法，充分地发挥有组织的共同劳动的优越性，开展劳动竞赛，鼓励和要求每一个社员积极地劳动，努力地创造公共的和归社员个人所得的财富。
    第五条　农业生产合作社对于社员的劳动的报酬，实行“按劳计酬、多劳多得”的原则。
    第六条　农业生产合作社不许进行任何剥削，不许雇佣长工、出租土地、放债取利、进行商业剥削，也不许社员带雇工入社。
    农业生产合作社可以雇请技术人员；在生产紧急需要的时候，也可以雇请少数短工帮忙。农业生产合作社要给被雇请的人以合理的待遇。
    第七条　农业生产合作社在处理社内一切经济问题的时候，应该遵守公私兼顾的原则，使国家的利益、全社的利益和社员个人的利益得到正确的结合。
    农业生产合作社必须模范地尽它对国家的义务，按照国家规定的数量、质量和时间交纳农业税，按照国家的统购计划交售农产品，按照同国家采购机关所订的预购合同出卖农产品。
    农业生产合作社在分配劳动成果的时候，应该给全社留下为发展生产和发展公共文化福利事业所必需的资金，同时使每个社员得到应得的报酬。
    农业生产合作社应该在发展生产的基础上，逐步地提高社员的物质生活和文化生活的水平。
    第八条　农业生产合作社的内部生活，应该遵守民主的原则、团结的原则和不断进步的原则。
    农业生产合作社实行民主管理。合作社的一切工作人员应该同社员密切结合，遇事充分协商，依靠群众办好合作社，不得滥用职权，压制民主。
    农业生产合作社要采取各种有效的方法，不断地加强社内的团结，发展社员之间的同志的友爱。任何社员都不许歧视少数民族社员、外来户社员、新社员和女社员。
    农业生产合作社要采取各种有效的方法，不断地提高社员的政治觉悟，在社员中间经常地进行社会主义和爱国主义的思想教育，保证社员遵守国家的法律，响应共产党和人民政府的号召，领导社员向社会主义社会前进。
    第九条　农业生产合作社要同别的农业生产合作社建立密切的联系，并且要同供销合作社、信用合作社、手工业合作社等合作组织和农村里的国营经济机关建立密切的联系，以便互相协助来实现各自的经济计划，共同努力来实现国家的经济计划。
    农业生产合作社要努力团结社外的劳动农民（包括加入农业生产互助组的农民和单干的农民），积极地帮助他们发展生产和走上合作化的道路。
    第十条　农业生产合作社要开展对于富农和别的剥削分子的斗争，使农村中的资本主义剥削受到限制，逐步消灭。
    第二章　社　员
    第十一条　凡是年满十六岁的男女劳动农民，或者能够参加合作社劳动的别的劳动者（例如手工业劳动者和会计人员），自愿申请参加农业生产合作社的，经过社员大会通过，就成为社员。
    农业生产合作社在吸收社员的时候，要遵守以下的规定：
    （一）不许限制贫农入社，也不许排斥中农入社。
    （二）要积极地吸收复员军人、烈士家属、军人家属、国家机关工作人员家属和外来移民入社，并且要有计划地吸收参加辅助劳动的老弱孤寡入社。
    （三）在合作社初成立的几年之内，不接受过去的地主分子和富农分子入社。在合作社已经巩固，并且本县和本乡的劳动农民已经有四分之三以上参加了合作社的时候，对于已经依照法律改变成份的过去的地主分子，和已经多年放弃剥削的富农分子，才可以经过社员大会审查通过、县级人民委员会审查批准，个别地接受他们入社。
    （四）不接受被剥夺了政治权利的人入社，但是他的家属不受这个限制。
    第十二条　农业生产合作社可以接受不够社员条件而要求参加合作社劳动的人（例如不满十六岁的男女）参加劳动，并且应该同对待社员一样地按照他们的劳动给以报酬。
    第十三条　每个社员在社内都有以下的权利：
    （一）参加社内的劳动，取得应得的报酬。
    （二）参加社务活动，提出有关社务的建议和批评，对社务进行监督。选举合作社的领导人员和被选为合作社的领导人员。担任合作社的职务。
    （三）在不妨碍参加合作社劳动的条件下，经营家庭副业。
    （四）享受合作社举办的各项公共事业的利益。
    过去的地主分子和富农分子，在入社以后的一定时期内，不许担任社内任何重要的职务。
    第十四条　每个社员在社内都有以下的义务：
    （一）遵守社章。执行社员大会和管理委员会的决议。
    （二）遵守合作社的劳动纪律。按时完成分配给他的工作任务。
    （三）爱护国家的财产、全社公有的财产和社员私有而交给合作社公用的财产。
    （四）巩固全社的团结，同一切破坏合作社的活动作坚决的斗争。
    第十五条　社员有退社的自由。
    社员退社的时候，可以带走还是他私人所有的生产资料，可以抽回他所交纳的股份基金和他的投资。如果他的土地已经由合作社进行了重要的建设，无法带走，合作社应该用相当的土地同他交换，或者付给他适当的代价。如果他的土地经过合作社的经营质量变好了，他的农具和工具经过合作社的修理价值提高了，退社的人也应该付给合作社适当的代价。
    要求退社的社员一般地要到生产年度完结以后才能退社，以免妨碍全社生产，并且便于结算账目。
    第十六条　社员如果犯了严重罪行，被剥夺了政治权利，合作社必须把他开除出社。
    社员如果严重地违反社章，或者犯了多次重大错误，经过多次教育和处分还不悔改，合作社可以经过社员大会讨论决定，把他开除出社。被开除的人如果不服，可以请求县级人民委员会解决。
    开除社员，不能把他的家属中的社员连带开除。
    对于被开除的人在合作社里的财产，同退社的人的财产一样处理。
    第三章　土地
    第十七条　社员的土地必须交给农业生产合作社统一使用，因为农业生产合作社组成的基本条件，就是把社员分散经营的土地联合起来，加以合理的和有计划的经营。
    社员所有的藕池、鱼塘、苇地等特殊土地，如果面积比较大，不宜于个人经营，经过本主同意，也可以由合作社统一经营。
    为了照顾社员种植蔬菜或者别的园艺作物的需要，应该允许社员有小块的自留地。社员每户自留地的大小，应该按照每户人口的多少和当地土地的多少来决定，但是每口人所留的土地至多不能超过全村每口人所有土地的平均数的百分之五。
    第十八条　在农业生产合作社的初级阶段，合作社按照社员入社土地的数量和质量，从每年的收入中付给社员以适当的报酬。
    农业生产合作社的收入是由社员的劳动创造出来的，不是由社员的土地所有权创造出来的，因此，土地报酬必须低于农业劳动报酬，以便鼓励全体社员积极地参加合作社的劳动。但是在农业生产合作社发展的初期，土地报酬也不要过低，以便吸收土地较多较好的农民入社，并且使有土地而缺少劳动力的社员能够得到适当的收入。
    在土地特别多、人口特别少的地方，即使在合作社初办的时候，也可以根据当地的习惯，把土地报酬定得低些，或者不给土地报酬。相反，在土地特别少、人口特别多的地方，在合作社初办的时候，经过省级人民委员会许可，土地报酬也可以暂时相当于农业劳动报酬。
    第十九条　在社员取得土地报酬的条件下，农业税应该由社员负担。如果农业税由合作社负担，社员的土地报酬就应该相应地减少。
    第二十条　土地报酬一般地应该由合作社议定固定的数量，不随着全社生产的发展而增加，以便全社生产发展的利益能够充分地用在劳动报酬方面和公共财产积累方面。
    但是，在合作社初办的时候，特别是在土地的产量比较不稳定的地方，如果还没有把握议定土地报酬的固定数量，也可以暂时采取分成报酬的办法，或者别的适当的过渡办法。分成报酬就是从每年实际收获中扣除当年的生产费、公积金和公益金以后，分出一定的成数作为土地报酬，把其余的部分作为劳动报酬。
    土地报酬的数量或者成数议定以后，在一定的时期内，在生产没有显著地增长以前，不应该降低，以免土地较多较好的社员觉得吃亏，有土地而缺少劳动力的社员减少收入。
    藕池、鱼塘、苇地等特殊土地的报酬，分别参照当地的习惯议定。
    第二十一条　土地报酬按照社员入社的土地在平常年成可能达到的产量来计算。评定社员入社土地的产量，一方面要根据土地的质量，照顾许多贫苦社员的土地原来不能达到应有的产量，而入社以后产量就能够提高的情形；另一方面要根据土地的实际产量，使入社以前改善了土地质量的社员得到应得的报酬。
    第二十二条　社员租种的或者代管的土地一般地应该改为由合作社租种或者代管。但是，个别的贫苦社员用低租租种的土地，或者替亲友代管的土地，经过社员大会同意，也可以给他以相当的报酬。
    社员私有的荒地，经过本主同意，可以由合作社进行开垦，并且在开垦以后的两三年内不给土地报酬。
    农业生产互助组所开垦的荒地，在组员集体地加入合作社的时候归合作社使用；对于个别没有入社的组员，可以由合作社给以适当的补偿。
    第二十三条　社员入社的时候，他的土地上如果带有青苗，应该交给合作社统一经营。处理青苗地的收获可以采取下列办法的一种：
    （一）收获全归本主所有，由本主偿付合作社在统一经营中所费的工本。如果这块青苗地当年只收获这一次，本主就不应该得土地报酬；如果不止收获这一次，本主也应该少得土地报酬。
    （二）收获归合作社统一分配，由合作社偿付本主入社以前在青苗上所费的工本，并且照付土地报酬。
    （三）收获按照议定的土地报酬和劳动报酬的临时分配比例单独处理，单收、单打、单分。
    第二十四条　社员土地上附属的私有的塘、井、渠、坝等水利建设，随社员的土地归合作社使用，由合作社负责保养和修理。
    如果这种水利建设是旧有的，因为它已经增加了社员入社以前的土地产量和入社以后的土地报酬，合作社一般地无须再给本主以报酬。如果这种水利建设在归合作社以后，还可以灌溉别的土地，合作社应该按照灌溉的效益和当地的习惯，给本主以适当的报酬。如果这种水利建设是新修的，本主还没有得到适当的收益，要求合作社收买，并且得到合作社的同意，可以由合作社适当地偿付本主所费的工本，转为全社公有。应付的款项，在几年以内分期付清；没有付清以前的利息问题，由合作社和本主协商解决。
    第四章　土地以外的主要生产资料
    第二十五条　社员的土地以外的主要生产资料为农业生产合作社所需要的，应该由合作社统一使用或者统一经营，给本主以适当的报酬，并且在得到本主同意的条件下，由合作社分批分期地逐步实行公有化。统一使用或者统一经营这些生产资料的具体范围和方式，给本主报酬的方式，以及公有化的时间和方式，应该按照生产资料的性质分别处理。本章所说的生产资料包括以下三类：
    （一）耕畜（耕种用的马、牛、骡、驴等）、大型农具（犁、新式犁、马拉农具、水车、风车、抽水机等）、农业运输工具（车、船等）等。这一类生产资料是农业生产所不可缺少的，应该尽先由合作社统一使用。
     （二）成片的林木、成群的牧畜（成群地放牧或者饲养的牲畜）等。这一类生产资料同农业有密切的关系，一般地应该逐步由合作社统一经营。
    （三）大型的副业工具和副业设备。这一类生产资料同农业的关系比较不固定，合作社只需要统一使用其中的一部分。
    第二十六条农业生产合作社对于社员私有的耕畜的处理办法，可以有以下三种：
    （一）社员的耕畜还是由社员私有，并且由他自己喂养，由合作社按照当地的正常的租价租用（私有私养公用）。这种办法，一般地适用于初办的合作社。
    合作社租用的这些耕畜，在合作社不需用的时候，本主可以自己使用、租给别人或者借给别人。但是本主如果出卖这些耕畜，必须得到合作社的同意。
    如果合作社在租用期间因为照管不周，以致社员的耕畜死亡或者残废，要给本主以适当的赔偿。
    （二）社员的耕畜还是由社员私有，但是由合作社统一喂养，统一使用，给本主以适当的报酬（私有公养公用）。
    私有公养的耕畜生下的小畜，可以由合作社和本主伙分收益，也可以完全归本主或者完全归合作社。处理的办法，参照当地的习惯议定。
    如果合作社因为照管不周，以致社员的耕畜死亡或者残废，也要给本主以适当的赔偿。
    （三）社员的耕畜由合作社按照当地的正常的价格收买，转为全社公有。这种办法，是一切合作社在办了相当时期以后所必须采取的。有些合作社虽然办得不久，但是确实有力量收买和喂养耕畜，也可以采取这种办法。
    为了兼顾社员的负担能力和本主的利益，合作社收买耕畜的价款应该在适当的期限内分期地付给本主；期限一般地以三年为宜，至多不能超过五年。没有付清的价款的利息问题，由合作社和本主协商解决。
    农业生产互助组公有的耕畜，在组员集体地加入合作社的时候转为全社公有，对于个别没有入社的组员，可以由合作社给以适当的补偿。
    第二十七条　社员私有的大型农具和农业运输工具，合作社可以按照生产的需要租用。租用的报酬，按照开始租用的时候这些东西值多少钱、能用多少年来议定。租用的农具和农业运输工具有了损坏，由合作社负责修理。如果损坏很大，不能修理，由合作社赔偿。小型农具（镰刀、锄头等）由社员自备自修。
    第二十八条　社员私有而合作社经常需用的大型农具和农业运输工具，合作社可以按照收买耕畜的办法收买，转为全社公有。农业生产互助组公有的农具和农业运输工具，在组员集体地加入合作社的时候，按照处理互助组公有的耕畜的办法处理。
    第二十九条　社员私有的林木，应该根据以下的原则，按照不同的情况分别处理：
    （一）零星树木，归社员自己所有，自己经营。
    （二）需要经常投入大量劳动的林木，例如果园、茶山、桑田、桐山、竹林等，应该交给合作社统一经营，由合作社付给合理的报酬。报酬的议定，要根据收益的大小和经营的难易，兼顾本主以前所费的工本和合作社今后所费的工本。
    （三）费工比较少、收益比较多的成材林，例如松林、杉林等，经过本主同意，也可以由合作社统一经营。合作社经营这种林木所得的收益，在扣除所费的工本（护林、砍伐、运送等）和应得的利益以后，其余部分都给本主。
    （四）新栽的幼林应该交给合作社统一经营。本主应得的报酬可以到有收益的时候再付。如果本主同意，幼林也可以由合作社按照他所费的工本收买，转为全社公有。幼林转为公有以后，林地的土地报酬问题，由合作社按照当地的习惯处理。
    第三十条　在畜牧业不占主要地位的农业生产合作社中，社员私有的牧畜，一般地还是归社员自己所有，自己经营。如果牧畜数量很大，合作社又有发展畜牧业的适当条件，经过合作社和本主双方同意，也可以交给合作社统一经营。本主应得的报酬，参照当地的习惯议定。
    社员要求合作社收买他的牧畜，在双方同意的条件下，合作社可以收买，转为全社公有。
    第三十一条　社员的大型的副业工具和副业设备，应该按照副业的性质来处理。如果副业宜于由家庭经营，工具和设备应该归社员自己所有；如果副业宜于由合作社集体经营，工具和设备可以按照处理社员私有的大型农具的办法处理。
    第五章　股份基金
    第三十二条　农业生产合作社为了准备种子、肥料、草料等生产开支，为了收买社员的耕畜、农具等生产资料，需要向社员征集股份基金。用作生产开支的，叫做生产费股份基金；用来收买社员的耕畜、农具等生产资料的，叫做公有化股份基金。
    股份基金一般地由社员按照入社的土地分摊。如果社员的土地报酬比较低，也可以按照劳动力分摊一部分；如果土地报酬很低甚至没有报酬，就应该完全按照劳动力分摊。如果征集的股份基金是用在畜牧业、林业或者副业生产方面的，可以另行规定分摊的办法。
    贫苦的社员确实不能交清股份基金的，可以向银行申请（自己申请或者由合作社代为申请）贫农合作基金贷款来交清。
    社员交纳的股份基金分记在各人名下，不计利息，只有在社员退社的时候才能抽回。
    第三十三条　社员应交的生产费股份基金，大致相当于当地普通农民一年内在同样的土地上生产，所用的种子、肥料、草料等的价款。
    生产费股份基金按现金计算，但是社员可以用实物抵交。
    生产费股份基金一般地应该在社员入社的时候交清，但是其中草料一项，在合作社还没有公养的或者公有的耕畜以前不交，有了公养的或者公有的耕畜才交。
    第三十四条　社员应交的公有化股份基金，原则上相当于合作社所收买的社员的耕畜、农具等生产资料的价款。如果这笔价款数目过大，许多社员负担不起，公有化股份基金就不能按照这笔价款的数目来规定，而只能够相当于价款的大部分或者一部分。在这种情况下，其余部分的价款应该由合作社用公积金付清。
    向合作社出卖耕畜、农具等生产资料的社员，可以用合作社所应付给他的价款抵交他所应交的公有化股份基金，多退少补；这就是说，抵交以后多余的部分由合作社补付给社员，不足的部分由社员补交给合作社。
    社员交清公有化股份基金的期限，同本章程第四章规定的合作社给耕畜、农具等生产资料的本主付清价款的期限一样，一般地也以三年为宜，至多不能超过五年。在社员没有交清公有化股份基金以前，合作社所欠本主价款应付的利息，由合作社用公积金付出。
    第三十五条　农业生产互助组的组员集体地加入合作社，把他们的公共财产转为合作社公有，他们所应交的股份基金就应该适当地减少。
    第三十六条　农业生产合作社资金不够的时候，社员应该按照自己的力量向合作社投资。社员的投资应该由合作社在一年到三年内偿还。
    合作社对于社员的现金投资所付的利息，一般地要相当于信用合作社的存款利息。合作社对于社员的实物投资所付的利息，可以按照当地的习惯议定，或者比现金投资的利息低一些，或者不计利息。
    第三十七条　农业生产合作社有权按照合理的价格优先收买社员家庭所积存的肥料。肥料的价款可以在收获以后付清，不计利息。
    第六章　生　产
    第三十八条　农业生产合作社应该根据本身的经济条件和当地的自然条件，积极地采取以下各种办法，提高农业生产的水平：
    （一）合理地使用耕地（按照土地的条件种植适宜的作物，各种作物合理地轮种和间作，根据可能的条件增加复种面积，扩大高产量作物的播种面积等）。
    （二）兴修小型水利（挖塘、打井、筑坝、开渠、修堤、修围、修建小型水库等），增加水田，扩大灌溉面积，改善灌溉方法。
    （三）采用新式农具，掌握使用新式农具的技术。
    （四）保护和繁殖耕畜（建立喂养和使用耕畜的制度，防止喂养不好和使用过度，防治畜疫，积极地繁殖耕畜，改良畜种等），发展畜牧业。
    （五）改良作物品种（实行选种、留种，换用和培养优良品种等）。
    （六）增加肥料，合理地施肥（尽量利用各种自然的和人造的肥料，鼓励社员积肥，改进施肥的方法等）。
    （七）改进耕作方法（深耕细作，采用先进的方法处理种子和培育秧苗，及时地播种，适当地密植，加强田间管理等），防治病虫 害，同各种自然灾害作斗争。
    （八）修整耕地，改良土壤，护林造林，培护草坡，进行农、林、牧、水综合的水土保持措施。
    （九）在不妨碍水土保持的条件下开垦荒地，在可能的条件下组织移民垦荒。
    （十）利用荒山发展林业，利用水流发展水产。每个农业生产合作社应该努力找出增加本社生产的最关紧要的办法，用最大的力量贯彻实行。
    第三十九条　在不妨碍农业生产、不进行商业投机的条件下，农业生产合作社应该根据需要和可能，积极地经营副业生产，逐步地发展农业同手工业、运输业、畜牧饲养业、渔业、林业等生产事业相结合的多种经济，以便发挥合作社的潜力，帮助农业和整个农村经济的发展。
    在不妨碍合作社生产的条件下，农业生产合作社应该鼓励和帮助社员经营宜于分散经营的家庭副业生产。
    第四十条　农业生产合作社应该动员全体男女社员积极地参加全社的农业和副业生产劳动。合作社应该尽量地帮助女社员克服参加生产所遇到的障碍和困难，并且在分配生产任务的时候注意到她们的特长和特点。
    第四十一条　农业生产合作社应该积极地提倡和组织社员学习科学知识和生产技术，奖励社员在生产上的创造。合作社应该同农业科学机关和农业技术推广站合作，提高社员的技术水平，培养本社的技术人员，按照具体条件积极地推广各种先进经验。
    第四十二条　农业生产合作社为了有计划地进行生产，逐步地实现本章所规定的发展生产的各项任务，并且使自己的生产同国家的要求相适应，应该在每年的秋末或冬季定出下一年度的生产计划。
    年度生产计划应该逐步地做到包括以下的内容：播种计划和产量计划；劳动力和畜力的使用计划；生产资料的供应计划；基本建设计划；副业生产计划。
    为了保证年度生产计划的完成，合作社应该按照当地的农事季节或者耕作段落，订出一个季节或者一个段落的计划，具体地规定生产任务和完成任务的期限。
    为了使年度生产计划能够有长远的打算作根据，并且使合作社的活动能够适应整个农村的各方面发展的需要，合作社应该制定三年以上的长期计划，全面地规划这个时期内各项生产和建设的任务。
    第七章　劳动组织和劳动纪律
    第四十三条　农业生产合作社为了进行有组织的共同劳动，必须按照生产的需要和社员的条件，实行劳动分工，并且建立一定的劳动组织，逐步地实行生产中的责任制。
    合作社为了实行农业生产中的责任制，应该把社员编成几个生产队，把生产队作为劳动组织的基本形式，让各个生产队在全社的生产计划的指导下，自行安排一个时期的和每天的生产。
    生产队可以按照需要，分成临时性的生产组。规模比较小的合作社可以只分生产组，不设生产队。
    合作社应该指定专人担任或者兼任会计员、技术员、饲养员、保管员等。公共牲畜比较多的合作社，可以设专门负责喂养牲畜的生产队或者生产组。
    副业规模比较大的合作社，可以根据需要，设专门负责副业的生产队或者生产组。
    生产队设队长，生产组设组长，负责全队全组的生产工作。
    第四十四条　合作社在配备田间生产队的成员的时候，一般地应该使各个队在劳动力的多少上、技术的高低上、领导力量的强弱上和居住地点的远近上相差不多，都便于独立活动；在给各个生产队分配任务的时候，应该作适当的安排，使各个队都能够经常有工作。
    第四十五条　生产队的组织应该是常年固定的。但是一开始也可以是一个耕作段落的或者一个季节的组织，以便取得经验，逐步地过渡成为常年的组织。
    田间生产队有了常年固定的组织以后，各个队所负责经营的土地，所使用的耕畜和农具，也应该逐步地做到常年固定，以便各个队能够负责经营好分配给它的土地，负责保护好分配给它的耕畜和农具，能够作出自己的生产计划，负责完成自己的生产任务。
    田间生产队有了常年固定的组织以后，合作社对于生产队的人员、耕畜、农具还是可以作必要的调整和临时的调动。
    第四十六条　生产队长或者生产组长应该注意正确地分配本单位每个人的劳动任务，充分地发挥有组织的共同劳动的优越性，使生产效率提高；并且尽量地使每个人（特别是老弱病残的社员）都能够发挥力量，都能够从劳动中得到一定的收入。
    在可能的范围内，生产队长或者生产组长应该给每个人指定负责专管的地段或者工作，彻底地实现生产中的责任制。
    第四十七条　生产队长或者生产组长应该在每天工作完毕的时候，检查本单位各人的工作成绩，并且根据工作定额登记各人所应得的劳动日。如果合作社还没有规定工作定额，队长或者组长要在一定时期内，召集队员或者组员，根据各人的工作状况，民主评定各人所应得的报酬。
    合作社的主任、副主任等负责工作人员，应该经常地有计划地检查生产队、生产组的工作。
    第四十八条　农业生产合作社社员，除了有特殊情形得到社员大会许可的以外，都必须每年在社内做够一定的劳动日。
    第四十九条　农业生产合作社社员应该遵守劳动纪律。劳动纪律必须包括以下各项：（一）不无故旷工；（二）劳动的时候听指挥；（三）保证劳动的质量；（四）爱护公共财产。
    对于违反劳动纪律的社员，要进行教育和批评；如果情节严重，应该酌量给以扣减劳动日、赔偿损失、撤消职务以至开除出社的处分。
    第八章　劳动的报酬
    第五十条　农业生产合作社对于社员劳动的报酬，应该根据“按劳计酬、多劳多得”的原则，逐步地实行按件计酬制，并且无条件地实行男女同工同酬。
    为了实行按件计酬制，必须规定各种工作的不同的定额和不同的报酬标准。
    对于一种工作，在一定的土地、耕畜、农具、天时等条件下，一个中等的劳动力做了一天所能够达到的数量和质量，就是这一种工作的定额。合作社必须逐步正确地规定全社各种工作的定额。定额不应该定得太低，以免多数社员都可以不费力地超过定额；也不应该定得太高，以免多数社员都达不到定额。如果原定的定额太低，或者太高，或者劳动条件有了变化，就应该适当地修改定额。
    完成每一种工作的定额所应得的报酬，用劳动日作计算单位。一个劳动日等于十个工分。完成每一种工作的定额所应得的劳动日的多少，应该根据每一种工作所需要的技术程度、劳动过程中的辛苦程度和这种工作在整个生产中的重要性来评定。完成一种中等工作定额，应该记一个劳动日。
    合作社必须正确地评定完成每一种工作定额所应得的劳动日。完成各种工作定额所得的劳动日必须有适当的差别，这种差别既不要太小，也不要太大。一方面要防止平均主义，不使担任繁难工作的社员吃亏；另一方面也不要使一部分工作报酬标准过高，大家抢着做，一部分工作报酬标准过低，没有人愿意做。
    第五十一条　在没有规定各种工作的定额和报酬标准以前，合作社可以暂时采取“死分活评”的办法，按照每个社员劳动力的强弱和技术的高低评定一定的工分，再根据他每天劳动的实际状况进行评议，好的加分，不好的减分，作为他当天所得的劳动日。但是这种办法既费时间，又不能按照每个社员的实际的劳动正确地计算报酬，因此，合作社必须尽快地规定各种工作的定额和报酬标准，以便克服劳动报酬上的混乱现象，避免生产上的损失。
    第五十二条　一个劳动日能够分到多少东西，根据全社全年收入多少东西来决定。一般地说，全社全年在生产中得到的实物和现金，在扣除生产费、公积金、公益金和土地报酬以后，用全社全年劳动日的总数来除，除出来的就是每一个劳动日所应该分到的。全社全年的收入越多，一个劳动日分到的也越多；全社全年的收入少了，一个劳动日分到的也就少了。因此，每一个社员为了多得收入，既要自己积极劳动，以便多得劳动日；又要努力促进全社的整个收入增加，使每一个劳动日所能够分到的东西跟着增加。这样，就使社员的个人利益和合作社的集体利益得到正确的结合。
    第五十三条　合作社内因为参加社务工作不能经常参加生产劳动的工作人员，可以每年由社员大会议定，根据他所负担的工作的多少和工作成绩的好坏，补贴他适当数目的劳动日。合作社主任所得的补贴，加上他自己参加生产劳动所得的劳动日，一般地应该高于全社中等劳动力所得的劳动日的平均数。会计员和规模很大的合作社的主任等工作人员，如果必须脱离生产劳动，他们所应得的报酬也由社员大会议定；这种报酬一般地应该相当于或者高于中等劳动力所得的劳动日的平均数。
    第五十四条　受代耕待遇的烈士家属和军人家属，可以把代耕的人（无论是不是社员）代他们完成的劳动日作为他们自己的劳动日。领代耕费的烈士家属和军人家属，如果他们和合作社双方同意，也可以把所得的代耕费交给合作社，由合作社照记相当数目的劳动日。
    第五十五条　为了把劳动报酬上的按件制同劳动组织上的责任制结合起来，农业生产合作社应该推行包工制，就是把一定的生产任务，按照工作定额预先计算出一定数目的劳动日（如果合作社还没有规定工作定额，可以按照当地包工的习惯，议定一定数目的劳动日），包给生产队限期完成。生产队无论因为劳动效率高，少用了劳动时间，或者因为劳动效率低，多用了劳动时间，都得到同样数目的劳动日。
    如果生产队的工作质量不合要求，合作社可以要求它重做，或者酌量地扣减它所应得的劳动日。如果生产队的工作时间超过了限期，合作社也可以酌量地扣减它所应得的劳动日。如果生产队在生产中克服了特殊的困难，创造了特殊的成绩，合作社应该酌量地多给劳动日。
    实行包工制的生产队所得的劳动日，应该按照各个队员实际上完成工作定额的多少分配给队员。如果合作社还没有规定工作定额，可以暂时采取民主评议的方法，评定各个队员所应得的劳动日。
    第五十六条　农业生产合作社应该尽可能从实行耕作段落的和季节的包工制（小包工），逐步地过渡到实行常年的包工制（大包工）。
    在实行常年包工制的时候，应该规定生产队所必须完成的农作物的产量计划和合作社管理委员会所必须负责执行的生产资料的供应计划，并且实行超产奖励制。对于超额完成了产量计划的生产队，应该酌量地多给劳动日，作为奖励；对于经营不好，产量不到计划数的百分之九十的生产队，也可以酌量地扣减劳动日，作为处罚。如果在包工期间遇到不能抗拒的灾害，应该根据受灾程度，修改产量计划。
    第五十七条　农业生产合作社对于劳动竞赛中优胜的单位和个人，对于在生产技术、生产管理等方面有特殊贡献的单位和个人，都应该给以奖励。农业生产合作社由于领导得好，超额完成了全社的生产计划的时候，经常负责社务的工作人员也应该得到适当的奖励。
    第九章　财务管理和分配
    第五十八条　农业生产合作社管理委员会应该在制定年度生产计划的同时，制定年度预算，也就是财务收支计划，提交社员大会审查和批准。
    合作社的预算应该包括：资金（包括实物和现金）的来源和本年使用资金的计划；本年生产总值（包括农业和副业生产中所得到的实物和现金）的概算和分配的概算。
    第五十九条　农业生产合作社的资金的主要来源是：社员交纳的股份基金；生产的收入；社员的投资。在确有必要的时候，合作社可以请银行或者信用合作社贷款。
    第六十条　农业生产合作社使用资金，必须严格地注意节约，避免浪费。每年预算中的生产费（包括种子、草料和社内肥料的开支，向外购买肥料、农药的费用，修理农具、医治耕畜的费用，租用社员的耕畜、农具的报酬，生产管理费等）的多少，应该按照各地方各合作社的具体情况规定，不应该过高或者过低。生产费的各个项目，应该定出开支的限额，其中生产管理费的限额不能超过全年生产总值的百分之一。
    合作社应该教育和监督自己的工作人员在使用资金的时候厉行节约，并且应该教育和监督全体社员爱护公共财产，防止公共财产的浪费和损失。
    第六十一条　农业生产合作社为了避免资金的浪费和损失，应该建立必要的财务制度。
    预算内一般的开支，必须经过管理委员会主任批准。预算内较大的开支，必须经过管理委员会通过。追加预算，必须经过社员大会审查和批准。对一切不合制度和手续的开支，会计员有权拒绝。
    合作社的一切收支必须有单据证明，会计员必须凭单据记账。会计和出纳必须逐步地做到分人负责：会计员管账不管钱，出纳员管钱不管账。出纳员无权自行支付任何款项。
    合作社的一切公共财产必须有专人保管，并且定出登记、保管和按时清点的办法。
    合作社社员如果对于公共财产有贪污、盗窃、破坏的行为，或者由于不负责任造成公共财产的重要损失，都必须赔偿，并且受到应得的处分；情节严重的，合作社应该请司法机关处理。
    第六十二条　农业生产合作社的账目必须按时公布。每个社员所得的劳动日的账目，按月、按生产季度公布。财务开支，按月、按年度公布。公共财产的清单，在年度结账的时候公布。
    合作社监察委员会必须定期检查合作社的各种账目。
    第六十三条　农业生产合作社在全年生产中得到的实物和现金，有以下两种分配办法：
    （一）在由社员家庭各自负责交纳农业税、交售国家所统购的农产品、向采购机关出卖农产品的情况下，应该按照下列次序进行分配：
    一、扣出本年生产中的各项消耗，留作下年的生产费。
    二、留出一定数量的公积金和公益金。
    三、支付社员的土地、林木和牧畜的报酬，支付租种的土地的租金。
    四、按照农业生产、副业生产和社务工作的全部劳动日，分配社员的劳动报酬。
    （二）在由合作社统一负责交纳农业税、交售国家所统购的农产品、向采购机关出卖农产品的情况下，应该首先履行上述对国家的义务，然后对余下的实物、现金和由交售、出卖农产品得来的现金按照上一项所列的次序进行分配。
    实行第一种办法的合作社应该积极准备实行第二种办法。
    第六十四条　公积金的用途限于进行合作社的基本建设（例如购买耕畜、农具和副业工具，修整土地，保持水土，兴修小型水利，垦荒，造林等）和增加生产费，不能挪作别用。公积金的数量，在合作社初办的时候，一般地不要超过合作社每年实际收入（生产总值扣除生产中的各项消耗）的百分之五，以后随着生产的发展，可以逐步地提高到百分之十。但是，在经营技术作物的合作社，公积金可以略为增加。
    公益金的用途限于发展合作社的文化事业和公共福利事业，也不能挪作别用。公益金的数量，在合作社初办的时候，一般地可以占合作社每年实际收入的百分之一，以后随着生产的发展，可以逐步地提高到百分之二或者百分之三。
    第六十五条　在丰收的年份，农业生产合作社的公积金和公益金可以酌量增加。在灾荒的年份，公积金、公益金和社员的土地报酬应该酌量削减，社外的贷款和社员的投资可以由合作社向债权人请求延期归还。下年的生产费如果不能留够，可以在下年收获以后补齐。
    第六十六条　春季和夏季收获的农产品，在合作社留下所需要的部分以后，应该按照社员所得的劳动日的数目，同时顾到社员的实际需要，预先分配给社员，到生产年度终了再结算。
    合作社的现金收入，在合作社留下所需要的部分以后，也可以根据社员的实际需要，允许社员（特别是有困难的社员）预支，到生产年度终了再结算。社员预支，一般地不应该超过他已经完成的劳动日预计应得的报酬。
    第六十七条　分配给社员的实物和现金的搭配，以及各种实物的搭配，都要尽量顾到社员的实际需要。属于国家统购统销范围内的产品，社员中间有多余的，有不足的，合作社应该加以调剂。
    第六十八条　公积金、公益金和合作社所积累的别的一切公共财产，都不允许分散。社员退社，只能按照本章程第十五条的规定，带走还是他私人所有的生产资料，抽回他所交纳的股份基金和他的投资，不能分走合作社所积累的任何公共财产。两个以上的合作社合并的时候，不允许任何一个合作社分掉合并以前所积累的一切公共财产。
    已经积累了公共财产的合作社，在接受新社员入社的时候，除了要他交纳应交的股份基金以外，不应该对他提出额外的要求。
