Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 15th: The four foreign ministers concluded the discussion on the third item on the agenda – the development of contacts between East and West – at the meeting on the morning of November 15th. The meeting was chaired by Macmillan.

Molotov spoke first at the meeting. He said that regarding this issue, the Soviet delegation most hoped to achieve some positive gains in developing economic and cultural contacts between East and West, and in resolving all issues related to this matter. Moreover, the Soviet government has already taken many steps to implement the general instructions made at the four-government heads' meeting in July regarding this issue. Molotov pointed out the progress made in developing contacts in recent times. The number of political figures, industrialists, businessmen, journalists, cultural workers, and various groups from various countries visiting the Soviet Union has increased significantly. The number of various delegations sent by the Soviet Union to other countries has also increased.

Molotov said that the Soviet delegation carefully studied the draft statement proposed by the French delegation at the meeting on the 14th from the perspective of the extent to which it could promote economic and cultural relations between East and West. The Soviet delegation believes that the French delegation's draft is a step forward in the discussion of this issue, which we all value very much. This draft takes into account the opinions exchanged at the meeting to a certain extent, and therefore, we believe, it can help to coordinate our opinions. On the other hand, this draft contains suggestions that we consider inappropriate and off-topic. These are suggestions that in fact fall within the scope of the powers of each country and cannot be discussed at this meeting, as well as those that can be discussed directly by the parties concerned. Concrete discussions of such issues with the participation of experts from the parties concerned will yield better results than we can currently obtain.

Molotov said that after considering the French delegation's proposal, the Soviet delegation revised the original Soviet draft statement on the development of contacts between East and West.

The revised draft statement said that the four foreign ministers, in the interest of consolidating peace, establishing an atmosphere of trust between countries, and developing cooperation between countries, and after studying according to the instructions of the four heads of government, agreed to recommend to their respective governments: to create conditions conducive to the development of peaceful trade, and to take measures for this purpose to eliminate existing obstacles and restrictions in East-West trade, so that businessmen and trade organizations can more freely utilize the opportunities for East-West exchange. It is suggested that the four governments, within the scope of their capabilities, take measures to facilitate the free passage of merchant ships of all countries through straits and canals of international importance, and to eliminate existing restrictions on maritime traffic with certain countries. According to agreements that may be bilateral or multilateral in nature, promote the exchange of books, newspapers, scientific journals, films, and radio broadcasts.

The draft statement then advocated that the four foreign ministers agree to relax and expand East-West relations in terms of cultural, scientific, and technological exchanges, mutual visits of industrial, agricultural, and trade representatives, and scientific and technological groups and sports teams. These exchanges will be conducted under the most objective and effective conditions and in a mutually beneficial manner for all countries. Some specific issues that currently exist in connection with the development of East-West contacts should be studied directly by the countries concerned, recognizing the interests and legal standards of each country. Considering the contribution that the various agencies and specialized agencies of the United Nations can make to the measures for developing contacts, the four foreign ministers declare their support for the participation of all countries that wish to cooperate with international specialized agencies in these agencies.

After Molotov made his proposal, Dulles suggested a recess of twenty minutes so that the Western foreign ministers could study the Soviet proposal.

Dulles spoke first after the recess. He said that the United States was prepared to accept the French proposal if the Soviet Union accepted it. He insisted that the Soviet proposal did not contain or contained almost nothing that could promote the exchange of opinions and information, and did not conform to the instructions of the heads of government. Dulles believed that the Soviet delegation did not intend at all to consider the Western countries' opinions on the importance of freedom of movement and free contact in terms of ideas and information in its own proposal, although he admitted that the Soviet delegation had accepted certain points contained in the draft of the three Western countries on October 31.

Dulles said that the U.S. delegation could not accept the Soviet draft.

Pinay said that the draft proposed by the French delegation on the 14th was generally an attempt to reach a compromise. He insisted that the Soviet delegation had not taken into account this effort by the French delegation.

Pinay added that the exchanges that already exist should be maintained and developed. However, this contact is still very limited and does not provide an opportunity for an objective and thorough comparison of various ideas. Pinay reiterated that he believed that the French draft was in line with the instructions of the heads of government.

Macmillan said he agreed with Dulles' attitude. He said that if the French proposal could not be accepted, he thought it best to abandon all efforts to draft a document agreed upon by all parties and let each party publish its own document.

Molotov then spoke again, responding to the speeches of Dulles, Pinay, and Macmillan.

Molotov said: The purpose of the draft proposed by the Soviet delegation today is to provide a basis for making a unanimously agreed decision on the development of East-West contacts. It reflects everything that can become our common position on the development of East-West contacts and improve such contacts under the current circumstances. At the same time, this draft is moving closer to the French delegation's proposal. If the representatives of the United States, France, and the United Kingdom believe that the suggestions contained in our draft are unacceptable, then it is clear that the time has not yet come to formulate common opinions on this issue.

Molotov pointed out that Dulles listed the articles in the draft proposed by the three countries on October 31 and insisted that none of them had been accepted by the Soviet side. However, this is not in line with reality. On the other hand, Molotov cited some examples from the draft of the three countries to illustrate that this draft is neither in line with the suggestions made at the meeting of the heads of government, nor with the instructions made on this issue, and even less with the spirit of Geneva. Molotov pointed out that, for example, the draft of the three countries stipulated the establishment of "news centers" that any citizen could freely enter, while these "centers" that had once been established in some Eastern European countries were often centers of espionage activities. Such suggestions would only cause friction and would not help to effectively develop contacts that are in line with the interests of individuals, the interests of various economic and cultural groups, and the interests of our respective countries as a whole. For another example, the draft of the three countries regarding the development of personal tourism requires the Soviet Union to change its management system and the exchange rate of the Soviet currency, which violates the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. The draft of the three countries also suggests reaching an agreement on the principle of opening direct routes between Soviet cities and cities in the three Western countries on a reciprocal basis. This suggestion is not unacceptable in principle, but such issues must be discussed in direct negotiations between the parties concerned in appropriate places.

Molotov said: People get the impression that the suggestions of the three countries on October 31 were drafted in such a way as if the people who made the suggestions did not hope to reach an agreement. But if we put forward suggestions for the meeting to discuss only for such a purpose, or put them forward in such a way as to create an atmosphere of friction and make it difficult to reach an agreement on specific issues, then this is not in line with the proposition of developing contacts between East and West.

Molotov compared the suggestions of the three countries with the suggestions made by French Prime Minister Faure at the meeting of the four heads of government, proving that the suggestions of the three countries were not in line with the instructions of the heads of government, nor with the spirit of the Geneva Conference. Molotov said: We believe that most of Faure's suggestions are acceptable. Perhaps they are no longer acceptable to the French delegation, because it has already signed the draft of the three countries. Most of the seventeen points of the new suggestion are imbued with a completely different spirit, and their purpose is obviously not to strive for an agreement that all four countries can agree to.

The Soviet delegation is prepared to accept the above-mentioned suggestions made by Faure as a basis, if this suggestion can also be accepted by other delegations. Of course, some amendments and supplements need to be made to this suggestion, but these suggestions are imbued with the spirit of agreement and the spirit of Geneva; while what Pinay is now defending has a completely different purpose.

Speaking of the draft proposed by the Soviet delegation, Molotov said that the Soviet government believes that the main issue in the issue of developing East-West contacts is the issue of developing economic relations, that is, the issue of developing international trade. This will provide a solid foundation for the development of East-West contacts. The instructions of the heads of government indicate that it is appropriate to develop peaceful international trade and eliminate obstacles in this regard. These obstacles are more harmful to the countries that establish them than to the countries they are directed at when they are established. The Soviet Union is willing to promote the development of international trade, but if other governments think that this issue can wait, we are also willing to wait.

We advocate developing cultural ties, improving news services for the benefit of our respective countries, carrying out tourism, improving radio services, exchanging books and newspapers, etc. It seems that all these measures may be beneficial to both Eastern and Western countries. We believe that developing this kind of cultural ties, improving mutual news services, improving broadcasting services and the exchange of periodicals, and carrying out tourism in all aspects, that is, both individual and collective tourism - all this can be developed to the extent that the people of our respective countries are satisfied. This is the purpose of the Soviet draft submitted for the meeting to consider.

We suggest reaching an agreement on the development of contacts between East and West. We believe that it is not difficult to seek a basis for this agreement, if we consider the suggestions of the Soviet delegation and the suggestions of French Prime Minister Faure, as well as some parts of the suggestions of the three countries that were provided for our consideration. We believe that only such an agreement will conform to the decision of the heads of government and the instructions given to the foreign ministers.

After Molotov finished speaking, opinions were exchanged. During the exchange of opinions, the ministers of the three Western countries reiterated their negative attitude towards the Soviet delegation's proposal.

The morning meeting ended here.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 16th: The foreign ministers of France, Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States re-discussed the first item on the agenda – European security and the German question – at the afternoon meeting on November 15th. The meeting was chaired by Macmillan.

Molotov spoke first, talking about the issue of reducing foreign troops stationed in Germany. He said that the Soviet delegation had already made a suggestion, advocating the withdrawal of foreign troops from German territory within three months except for a limited number of troops stationed there. This suggestion is in line with the interests of the German people. But regrettably, this suggestion was not supported by the foreign ministers of the three Western countries. In view of this situation, the Soviet delegation made another suggestion on November 9, which stipulated that the troops stationed in Germany by the four countries should be reduced by 50%, and the number of troops withdrawn from Germany should be deducted from the total number of armed forces of their respective countries.

Molotov said that some people say that this suggestion seems to exceed the scope of the instructions of the heads of government. This statement cannot be agreed with. The Soviet government's suggestion now being discussed is directly based on the instructions of the four heads of government. Because the implementation of this suggestion will create a more favorable environment for implementing further measures to consolidate European security, and will be the first common step in disarmament. The implementation of this suggestion will improve the situation in Europe. In addition, reducing the number of foreign troops stationed in Germany, even if it is reduced by half, is in line with the interests of the German people.

Molotov said that the Soviet Union also suggested that an agreement should be reached now, with the consent of the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, on the issue of limiting the personnel establishment of the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. However, the three Western countries and the West German government did not agree, only the government of the German Democratic Republic agreed to this suggestion. The Soviet delegation attaches great importance to this suggestion, especially because it can eliminate suspicions in the relations between the two Germanys, and thus help to establish mutual understanding and cooperation between them.

Dulles then spoke, saying that the U.S. delegation was not prepared to consider these suggestions of the Soviet Union until the Soviet delegation continued to refuse to discuss the issue of restoring German unification through free elections. Dulles insisted that the American troops in Germany were stationed on German territory at the request of the German government and people to ensure collective security.

Pinay said that all his efforts to urge the Soviet delegation to discuss the entire proposal of the three Western countries had failed. He also said that the French government was very willing to discuss the Soviet government's proposals in the spirit of the heads of government's instructions, but, according to him, the Soviet delegation did not think it was possible to take this path.

Macmillan said that the suggestions made by the Soviet delegation had nothing to do with the work of the meeting and violated the spirit and provisions of the heads of government's instructions.

Subsequently, Molotov spoke again, talking about the Soviet proposal on the conclusion of treaties between existing European national groups. He said that at the meeting of the heads of government, this suggestion, like some other suggestions on European security issues, was not actually discussed. They were transferred to the meeting of foreign ministers for discussion.

Molotov said that since it would take time to reach a consensus on the issue of establishing a European collective security system, it was appropriate to reach an agreement on the conclusion of corresponding treaties aimed at maintaining and consolidating European peace, with the participants of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union as one party, and the participants of the Warsaw Treaty as the other party. The conclusion of such a treaty will promote the consolidation of international trust and create good conditions for taking other measures to organize an effective pan-European security system. This treaty takes into account the existing possibility of taking practical steps to further ease international tensions. This treaty also takes into account the interests of both sides to the same extent, and it does not involve the contentious issues that have not been able to reach a consensus at present.

Molotov pointed out that if the solution of any problem is subordinate to the solution of the entire German problem, this is actually equivalent to refusing to solve the problems that we can completely agree on at present. This suggestion is based on considering the actual situation in Europe at present, and is essentially based on the proposition previously made by Eden, who advocated reaching an agreement on the level of armed forces and armaments of the two groups on the territory of the existing two German states and on the territory of countries bordering Germany. This proposition was later endorsed in the instructions of the heads of government.

The Soviet delegation believes that if the delegations of the three Western countries adopt a positive attitude towards this suggestion, then the meeting can take a step forward on the road of further easing international tensions and strengthening international trust. This is what the people of all countries in the world are expecting.

Dulles said that the United States and the Soviet Union are both members of the United Nations, and the United Nations Charter already stipulates the obligations contained in the draft treaty proposed by the Soviet delegation. The United States intends to faithfully fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Charter, but is not prepared to sign any other security treaty with the Soviet Union that does not take into account the close relationship between the restoration of German unification and the issue of European security.

Pinay also said that the Soviet suggestion did not take into account the link between restoring German unification and ensuring security. He also said that this suggestion did not contain any new content compared with the United Nations Charter.

Macmillan said that Western countries could not adopt a security treaty based on maintaining the division of Germany. He said that the obligation not to use force is stipulated in the United Nations Charter and in the North Atlantic Treaty. He also said that the conclusion of the treaty suggested by the Soviet Union had no practical significance and seemed to cause misunderstandings among the public.

In response to the arguments of the foreign ministers of the three Western countries, Molotov pointed out that the fact that the United Nations Charter has provisions on the non-use of force did not prevent this from being included in the North Atlantic Treaty. Moreover, the draft treaty proposed by the delegations of the three Western countries on October 28 also suggested repeating this point.

Molotov said that all the suggestions in the draft treaty proposed by the Soviet delegation are fully in line with the United Nations Charter. However, the United Nations Charter never stipulates those military groups that have been established in Europe now. For the sake of peace, it is necessary for these groups to reach an agreement on the issue of not using force against each other and ensuring mutual consultation in the event of disputes. It would be very strange if some of us denied this necessity.

Molotov then said that someone told us that we either accept the suggestions made by the three Western countries on October 28, or we can only do nothing in terms of strengthening European security. After talking about the essence of the treaty draft of the three Western countries, Molotov pointed out that the real purpose of this treaty is not to ensure European security at all, but to re-militarize the entire Germany and drag the entire Germany into the military group of Western countries. Therefore, this draft cannot be used as the basis for an agreement, and this alone makes it inconsistent with the instructions of the heads of government and the spirit of the Geneva Conference.

After Molotov finished speaking, the foreign ministers of the Western countries said that they had nothing more to say about the first item on the agenda.

Molotov said that it might be very useful to make some summaries of the discussion on the first item on the agenda. We can point out on which issues our positions have been consistent or close, and express our willingness to continue to strive to reach an agreement on some other issues related to European security and the German question.

Based on the above situation, Molotov submitted the Soviet delegation's draft suggestion on the first item on the agenda to the meeting for discussion. The draft said: "The foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France confirm that although the result of the exchange of views on the first item on the agenda – European security and the German question – has not been able to obtain the necessary degree of consensus, there are the same attitudes on many important issues related to European security, namely:

1.  All participants in the meeting agree: The contracting states should stipulate in the European security treaty that they will renounce the use of force in their mutual relations.

2.  Agreement has been reached: According to the obligations undertaken under the European security treaty, some common measures should be stipulated to resist possible aggression in Europe.

3.  Agreement has also been reached: The contracting states will not help the aggressor.

4.  It is considered necessary to establish a region between the East and the West, in which measures to stipulate the maximum limits of the armed forces of the countries concerned and to stipulate corresponding inspections will be implemented.

5.  It is considered necessary for the contracting states to consult with each other to ensure that all countries fulfill the obligations they have undertaken under the European security treaty.

6.  It is also fully agreed that the obligations undertaken under the European security treaty should not harm the inalienable right of each country to individual or collective self-defense.

At the same time, all participants in the meeting pointed out that no agreement has been reached on the basic issues of ensuring European security, resolving the German question, and restoring German unification on the basis of strengthening cooperation between countries.

All participants in the meeting expressed their willingness to continue to strive to reach these agreements."

After Molotov made this suggestion, Dulles said that this suggestion should be studied tonight so that he can come back to talk about this suggestion at the next meeting to be held tomorrow. At the next meeting, the ministers will discuss the communique that the foreign ministers' meeting may make. Pinay agreed with this suggestion. Macmillan also said that such important documents needed to be studied. He said that tomorrow we should try to end our work, naturally, including reaching an agreement on the corresponding communique. He also suggested that the ministers hold a secret meeting "in order to determine what work still needs to be done."

The meeting accepted this suggestion, and then the ministers held a restricted meeting.

During today's meeting, the Soviet delegation also submitted to the meeting a draft statement of the four foreign ministers on the disarmament issue, the full text of which is as follows:

"In the spirit of promoting the easing of international tensions, strengthening trust between countries, eliminating threats of new wars, and reducing the burden of armaments.

The foreign ministers of the Soviet

### 四国外长会议十五日上午和下午继续举行　讨论第三项和第一项议程

　　四国外长会议十五日上午和下午继续举行
　　讨论第三项和第一项议程
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十五日讯：四国外交部长在十一月十五日上午的会议上结束了第三项议程——发展东西方之间的接触问题的讨论。会议主席是麦克米伦。
    莫洛托夫在会上第一个发言。他说，关于这个问题，苏联代表团最希望的是：在发展东西方之间的经济和文化接触方面以及在解决同这个问题有关的一切问题方面获得某些积极的收获。而且苏联政府已经采取了不少步骤来实施四国政府首脑七月会议上作出的关于这个问题的一般指示。莫洛托夫指出最近时期在发展接触方面获得的进展。到苏联参观访问的各国政界人士、工商业家、新闻记者、文化工作者和各种团体的数目已有显著的增加。苏联派到其他国家的各种代表团的数目也有增加。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团从能够促进东西方之间经济和文化关系的程度的观点出发，对法国代表团在十四日会议上提出的声明草案进行了仔细的研究。苏联代表团认为，法国代表团的草案在我们大家都非常重视的这个问题的讨论中前进了一步。这个草案在一定程度上考虑了会议上交换的意见，因此，我们认为，它能够有助于协调我们的意见。另一方面，这个草案中包含了我们认为是不适宜和离开主题的建议。这就是那些事实上只属于各国权限范围以内、不能够在这次会议上加以讨论的建议，以及那些能够由有关方面直接讨论的建议。这样的问题在有关方面专家参加下进行具体的讨论，所得到的结果将会比我们目前能够得到的结果为好。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团在考虑了法国代表团建议后，把苏联原来提出的四国关于发展东西方之间的接触的声明草案作了修改。
    修改后的声明草案说，四国外交部长本着巩固和平、建立国与国之间的信任气氛和发展国与国之间的合作的利益，遵照四国政府首脑指示进行研究后，同意向各自的政府建议：创造有利于发展和平贸易的条件，并且为这个目的采取措施，以便消除东西方贸易方面现存的障碍和限制，使商人们和贸易机构可以更自由地利用东西方交流的机会。建议四国政府在它们力所能及的范围以内采取措施来便利一切国家的商船自由通过具有国际重要性的海峡和运河，消除同某些国家在海上交通方面现有的限制。按照可以是双边或者多边性质的协定，促进书籍、报纸、科学杂志、影片以及无线电广播的交流。
    声明草案接着主张四国外交部长协议，在文化、科学技术交流，工业、农业、贸易代表和科学技术团体、体育队相互访问等方面放宽和扩大东西方之间的关系。这些交流将在最客观和最有效的条件下以及对各国互相有利的情况下进行。由有关国家在承认各该国的利益和法律标准的情况下，对现在存在着的一些同发展东西方之间的接触有关的具体问题直接予以研究。要考虑到联合国各机构和专门机构对发展接触的措施可以作出的贡献，四国外交部长声明赞成一切希望同国际性专门机构合作的国家参加这些机构。
    杜勒斯在莫洛托夫提出建议后建议休会二十分钟，以便西方国家的外交部长能够研究苏联的建议。
    杜勒斯在休会后首先发言。他说，美国准备接受法国的建议，如果苏联接受这个建议的话。他硬说苏联的建议中并没有或者是几乎没有能够促进意见和消息交流的东西，不符合政府首脑的指示。杜勒斯认为，苏联代表团在自己的建议中丝毫不打算考虑西方国家关于自由往来与思想和消息方面自由接触的重要性的意见，虽然他承认苏联代表团已经接受了十月三十一日西方三国的草案中包含的某些点。
    杜勒斯说，美国代表团不能接受苏联的草案。
    比内说，法国代表团在十四日提出的草案大体上是企图取得折衷。他硬说，苏联代表团并没有考虑到法国代表团的这种努力。
    比内又说，现在已经存在的交流应该继续保持和发展。但是这种交往仍然是很有限的，并且也不能为客观而彻底地比较各种思想提供机会。比内重复说他认为法国的草案是符合政府首脑的指示的。
    麦克米伦说他同意杜勒斯的态度。他说，如果法国的建议不能接受，他认为最好放弃一切拟订一个全体同意的文件的努力，而让各方公布各自的文件。
    莫洛托夫接着再次发言，答复杜勒斯、比内和麦克米伦的发言。
    莫洛托夫说：苏联代表团今天提出的草案的目的是，为在发展东西方接触问题上作出一致同意的决定提供基础，它反映了可以成为我们大家在发展东西方接触问题上的共同立场和在目前情况下改善这种接触的一切东西。同时，这一草案是向法国代表团的建议靠拢的。如果说，美国、法国和英国代表认为我们草案中所包含的那些建议是不能够接受的话，那末，很明显，就这一问题拟定出共同意见的时机还没来到。
    莫洛托夫指出，杜勒斯列举了三国在十月三十一日提出的草案中的各条，而且硬说，这个草案的任何一条都没有为苏联方面所接受。然而这是不符合实际情况的。另一方面，莫洛托夫从三国草案中举出一些例子，说明这个草案是既不符合在政府首脑会议上提出的建议，也不符合就这个问题所作出的指示，更不符合日内瓦精神。莫洛托夫指出，例如，三国草案，规定设立任何公民可以自由进入的“新闻中心”，而曾经一度在东欧一些国家设立过的这种“中心”常常是间谍活动的中心。这种建议只会引起磨擦而不能帮助有效地发展符合个人利益、各种经济和文化团体的利益以及我们各自的整个国家的利益的接触。又例如，三国草案关于发展个人游览旅行的建议，要求苏联改变管理制度和苏联货币的外汇率，这是违反互不干涉内政的原则的。三国草案还建议在相互的基础上就在苏联城市和西方三国的城市之间开辟直达航线的原则达成协议。这个建议在原则上并不是不可接受的，但是这种问题必须在适当的地方在有关双方之间的直接谈判里进行讨论。
    莫洛托夫说：人们得到这样的印象，十月三十一日的三国建议是这样起草的，好像提出建议的人并不希望取得协议。但是假使我们提出建议供会议讨论仅仅是为了这样的目的，或者用这样方式提出来以便制造一种摩擦的气氛，使具体问题难于达成协议的话，那么这就不符合于发展东西方之间的接触的主张。
    莫洛托夫把三国建议同法国总理富尔在四国政府首脑会议上提出的建议加以比较，证明三国建议是不符合于政府首脑们的指示，也不符合于日内瓦会议的精神的。莫洛托夫说：我们认为富尔的这些建议中大多数都是可以接受的。也许它们已经不能为法国代表团所接受了，因为它已经在三国草案上签了字。新建议的十七点中大多数都灌注着一种完全不同的精神，其目的显然不是要争取达成所有四国全都同意的协议。
    苏联代表团准备接受富尔所提出的上述建议作为基础，如果这个建议也能为其他代表团所接受的话。当然，对这项建议还需要提出某些修正案和作一些补充，但是这些建议里是灌注着协议精神、日内瓦精神的；而比内现在所为之辩护的东西却有着一个完全不同的目的。
    莫洛托夫在谈到苏联代表团所提出的草案时说，苏联政府认为发展东西方接触的问题中的主要问题就是发展经济关系的问题，就是发展国际贸易的问题。这将为东西方接触的发展提供坚实的基础。政府首脑的指示表明发展和平的国际贸易和消除这方面的障碍是相宜的。这些障碍对建立障碍的国家比对建立它们时所针对的国家更加有害。苏联愿意促进国际贸易的发展，但是假如其他政府认为这个问题可以等待，我们也愿意等待。
    我们主张发展文化联系，为了我们各国的利益改善新闻服务，开展游览，改善无线电服务，交换书报等等。看来所有这些措施可能对东方国家和西方国家都有好处。我们认为发展这种文化联系，改善相互的新闻服务，改善广播服务和期刊的交换工作，开展各方面的也就是个人的和集体的游览——这一切都能够发展到我们各国人民都感到满意的程度。这就是提供会议考虑的苏联草案的目的。
    我们建议就发展东西方之间的接触达成协议。我们认为要为这种协议寻求一个基础是不难的，如果我们把苏联代表团的建议和法国富尔总理的建议以及提供我们考虑的三国建议的有些部分都考虑在内的话。我们认为只有这种协议才会符合政府首脑的决定和给予外交部长的指示。
    莫洛托夫发言完毕后，就互相交换意见，在交换意见过程中西方三国部长们重申他们对苏联代表团的建议采取否定态度。
    上午会议到此结束。
    新华社十六日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦十六日讯：法、英、苏、美四国外交部长在十一月十五日下午会议上重新讨论了第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题。会议由麦克米伦担任主席。
    莫洛托夫第一个发言，他谈到关于减少驻德国的外国军队的问题。他说，苏联代表团已经提出过一项建议，主张除留驻有限的一部分军队以外在三个月内从德国领土上撤退外国军队。这一建议符合德国人民的利益。但是遗憾的是，这一建议没有得到西方三国外交部长的支持。鉴于这种情况，苏联代表团在十一月九日提出了另一项建议，这项建议规定把四国驻德军队缩减百分之五十，并且从它们各国的武装部队总额中裁减相当于从德国撤退的军队的人数。
    莫洛托夫说，有人说，这一建议似乎超出了政府首脑指示的范围。对这种说法是决不能同意的。现在所谈的苏联政府的建议是直接根据四国政府首脑的指示的。因为这一建议的实现会为实行巩固欧洲安全的进一步措施创造更有利的环境，并且将是在裁军方面的第一个共同步骤。这一建议的实现会改善欧洲的局势。此外，裁减外国驻德军队，即使是裁减一半，也是符合于德国人民的利益的。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联还建议现在就在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国政府的同意下，就限制德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国的武装部队的人员编制问题达成协议。但是西方三国和西德政府都不表同意，只有德意志民主共和国政府同意这个建议。苏联代表团十分重视这个建议，特别是因为它能消除两个德国关系中的猜疑，因此有助于在它们之间建立相互谅解和合作。
    杜勒斯接着发言说，在苏联代表团继续拒绝讨论通过自由选举恢复德国统一的问题之前，美国代表团不准备考虑苏联的这些建议。杜勒斯硬说，德国境内的美国军队是德国政府和人民希望驻扎在德国领土上以保障集体安全的。
    比内发言说，他为促使苏联代表团讨论西方三国的整个建议所作的一切努力都落空了。他还说，法国政府十分愿意本着政府首脑指示的精神讨论苏联政府的建议，但是，据他说，苏联代表团并不认为走这条路是可能的。
    麦克米伦说，苏联代表团提出的建议同会议的工作没有关系，并且是违反政府首脑指示的精神和条文的。
    随后莫洛托夫再次发言，谈到苏联提出的关于现有欧洲国家集团之间缔结条约的建议。他说，在政府首脑会议上，这个建议像有关欧洲安全问题的其他一些建议一样，实际上并没有经过讨论。它们被移交给外交部长会议讨论。
    莫洛托夫说，既然在建立欧洲集体安全体系问题上要取得立场的一致还需要时间，那末以北大西洋公约和西欧联盟参加者为一方，以华沙条约的参加者为另一方，就缔结旨在维护和巩固欧洲和平的相应条约达成协议是适宜的。缔结这样一个条约将能促进国际信任的巩固，为采取组织有效的全欧安全体系的其他措施创造良好的条件。这个条约考虑到采取实际步骤来进一步缓和国际紧张局势的现有可能性。这个条约也在同等的程度上考虑到双方的利益，它没有涉及到那些目前还没有能够取得一致意见的争执问题。
    莫洛托夫指出，如果把任何一个问题的解决都从属于整个德国问题的解决，这实际上就等于拒绝解决那些目前我们完全有可能达成协议的问题。这个建议是从考虑目前欧洲的实际情况出发的，并且实质上也是从艾登以前提出的主张出发的，艾登曾主张就两个集团在现存的两个德意志国家领土上以及在与德国接壤的国家的领土上的武装部队和军备的水平达成协议。这一主张后来在政府首脑指示中也得到了赞成。
    苏联代表团认为，如果西方三国代表团对这一建议采取肯定的态度，那末会议就可以在进一步缓和国际紧张局势和加强国际信任的道路上向前迈进一步。这是全世界各国人民都在期待着的。
    杜勒斯发言说，美国和苏联同是联合国的会员国，而联合国宪章已经规定有苏联代表团提出的条约草案中所包含的义务。美国打算忠实地履行宪章中规定的义务，但是不准备同苏联签订没有考虑到恢复德国统一和欧洲安全问题之间的密切关系的任何其他的安全条约。
    比内也说，苏联建议没有考虑到恢复德国统一和保障安全之间的联系。他还说，这一建议同联合国宪章比较一下也没有任何新的内容。
    麦克米伦说，西方国家不能够采纳以保持德国分裂为基础的安全条约。他说，不使用武力的义务，在联合国宪章中以及在北大西洋条约中都有规定。他还说，缔结苏联所建议的条约没有实际的意义，而且似乎会使公众发生误解。
    莫洛托夫在答复西方三国外交部长的论据时指出，联合国宪章中有不使用武力的规定并没有妨碍把这一点列到北大西洋公约中去。而且，西方国家代表团十月二十八日所提的条约草案中也同样建议重复这一点。
    莫洛托夫说，苏联代表团所提出的条约草案中的一切建议都完全符合联合国宪章。可是联合国宪章绝没有规定现在欧洲所建立起来的那些军事集团。为了和平的利益，这些集团就互不使用武力和保证在发生纠纷时互相磋商的问题取得协议是必要的，如果我们中间竟有人否认这种必要性，那才是很奇怪的。
    莫洛托夫接着说，有人对我们说，我们要么接受西方三国十月二十八日提出的建议，要么在加强欧洲安全方面就只能无所作为。莫洛托夫在谈到西方三国的条约草案的实质之后指出，这一条约的真正目的根本不是要保障欧洲安全，而是要使整个德国重新军国主义化和把整个德国拖进西方国家的军事集团。因此，这一草案不能作为协议的基础，单就这一点说它就不符合政府首脑指示和日内瓦会议的精神。
    莫洛托夫结束发言之后，西方国家外交部长们说，他们对第一项议程再没有什么意见。
    莫洛托夫说，对第一项议程的讨论作一些总结可能是十分有益的。我们可以指出在哪些问题上我们的立场已经一致或者接近了，并且表示准备继续努力谋求在同欧洲安全问题和德国问题有关的其他一些问题上达成协议。
    根据上述情况，莫洛托夫把苏联代表团关于第一项议程的建议草案提交会议讨论。草案说：“苏联、美国、英国和法国四国外交部长确认，虽然就第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题交换意见的结果还没有能够获得必需程度的一致，然而对有关欧洲安全的许多重要问题有了相同的态度，即：
    一、会议全体参加者赞成：在欧洲安全条约中规定缔约国在相互关系中放弃使用武力。
    二、已经取得同意：根据欧洲安全条约承担的义务，应该规定一些共同的措施，以便抵抗欧洲可能发生的侵略。
    三、还已经取得同意：缔约国不帮助侵略者。
    四、认为必须在东西方之间建立一个地区，在这个地区上实现关于规定有关国家武装部队最高限额和规定相应的视察的措施。
    五、认为缔约国有必要互相协商以保证各国履行根据欧洲安全条约所承担的义务。
    六、还完全同意，根据欧洲安全条约承担的义务不应当损害各国单独自卫或者集体自卫的不可剥夺的权利。
    同时，会议全体参加者都指出，在加强国与国之间的合作的基础上保障欧洲安全、解决德国问题和恢复德国统一这些基本问题上还没有达成协议。
    会议全体参加者都表示愿意为达成这些协议而继续努力。”
    在莫洛托夫提出这个建议之后，杜勒斯说，应当在今天晚上研究这个建议，以便在明天举行的下次会议上回头来谈这个建议。在下次会议上，部长们将讨论外长会议可能作出的公报。比内同意这个建议。麦克米伦也说，这样重要的文件需要加以研究。他说，明天我们应当设法结束我们的工作，自然，其中也包括就相应的公报达成协议。他还建议部长们举行秘密会议，“以便确定还需要进行的工作”。
    会议接受了这个建议，接着部长们举行限制性会议。
    在今天的会议过程中，苏联代表团还提交会议一项四国外交部长关于裁军问题的声明草案，全文如下：
      “本着促进国际紧张局势的缓和、加强国与国之间的信任、消除新战争的威胁和减轻军备负担的愿望。
    苏联、美国、英国和法国四国外交部长仍旧坚信必须继续争取就广泛的裁军计划达成协议，这一计划将有助于在以世界最少的人力物力用于军备需要的情况下保证国际和平和安全。
    他们的讨论表明，在这一目的上有了一致的意见，在有关裁减军备和禁止原子武器（包括必须建立有效的监督）的一些主要问题上，四国的立场已经接近。至于还没有达成协议的问题，四国外交部长同意，四国将会同其他有关国家一起努力消除现有的分歧，从而制定大家都可以接受的、包括在有效的保证下裁减各种军备和武装部队的裁军制度。
    同时四国外交部长同意，各国现在对各国履行裁军义务的监督方法的研究，应当以有助于解决裁军问题为目的。
    部长们同意，在这方面必须依照政府首脑的指示继续首先讨论包括在下列建议中的一些原则：
    一、苏联今年五月十日和七月二十一日关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和消除新战争威胁问题的建议；
    二、美国总统七月二十一日关于空中摄影和交换军事情报的建议；
    三、英国政府七月二十一日和八月二十九日关于裁军问题的建议；
    四、法国政府关于对裁军的财政监督和关于把节省下来的资源转用于和平目的的建议。
    部长们还确认，已经完全一致同意：四国依照四国政府首脑的声明，在它们之间的关系中将放弃使用武装力量，并且力求通过和平途径来解决它们之间所存在的、或是可能发生的分歧。”
    外交部长们将在十一月十六日举行下次会议。
