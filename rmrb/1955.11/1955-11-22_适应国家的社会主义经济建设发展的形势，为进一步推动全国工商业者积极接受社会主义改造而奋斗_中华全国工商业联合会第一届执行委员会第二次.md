Adapting to the Situation of National Socialist Economic Construction, Striving to Further Promote National Industrialists and Businessmen to Actively Accept Socialist Transformation
　　-- Opening Speech at the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce by Chen Shutong, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
Fellow Committee Members:

    Now, the Second Meeting of the First Executive Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce is open. It has been two years since the First Meeting held in November 1953. During these two years, our great motherland announced the general task for the transition period, promulgated the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, explicitly stipulated that our country would follow the socialist road, and inspired the enthusiasm of the people across the country in building socialism. Based on the recovery of the national economy, our country has begun the first five-year plan for developing the national economy, and is now nearing the completion of the third annual plan. The people across the country are making redoubled efforts to overfulfill this plan. The completion of the first five-year plan will begin to change the history of economic backwardness in our country for a century, push our country further toward the goal of an industrialized socialist society, and ensure that our country will be built into a prosperous and happy socialist society after several five-year plans.

    The general task of our country during the transition period is to realize the socialist industrialization of the country as the center, and on the basis of the socialist industrialization of the country, to carry out the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce. The basic task of the first five-year plan is to concentrate major forces on developing heavy industry, establishing the initial foundation for the socialist industrialization of our country; developing agricultural production cooperatives of partial collective ownership, and developing handicraft production cooperatives, establishing the initial foundation for the socialist transformation of agriculture and handicrafts; basically incorporating capitalist industry and commerce into various forms of state capitalism, establishing the foundation for the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. The people's democratic regime led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance enables our country to rely on state organs and social forces to gradually eliminate the exploitation system and establish a socialist society through socialist industrialization and socialist transformation of non-socialist components. Our socialist construction and socialist transformation cause has aroused the attention of the people of all countries and is of great international significance.

    Fellow Committee Members, it is of great significance that we are holding this meeting at this time. Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out: "Our cause of building socialism in China is based on socialist industrialization, and the transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce are two necessary components, and these three are inseparable." Now, the first five-year plan is proceeding smoothly, and the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement will appear nationwide. The socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce by the state has also made new developments. Many capitalist industrial and commercial enterprises, as well as handicrafts and small traders and peddlers, have gradually embarked on the road of state capitalism and cooperativization; many low-level and intermediate-level state capitalist enterprises have gradually been incorporated into the advanced form. At present, the state is adopting new methods such as overall planning, economic reorganization, and transformation by industry to transform private industry and commerce, which marks a step forward in the state's implementation of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Therefore, with the surge of economic construction and the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, under the new situation of the state's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce, it is even more necessary for our industrialists and businessmen to further strengthen our efforts and advance together with the development of the entire national economy.

    In the past two years, the state's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce has made great progress. In terms of private industry, in the initial stage of planned economic construction, the intermediate form of state capitalism, namely processing, ordering, unified purchase, and exclusive sales, was the main body, but many private factories still produced and sold their own products, and the unorganized free market still accounted for a considerable proportion. In the first half of this year, the value of products processed, ordered, uniformly purchased, exclusively sold, and purchased by the state accounted for more than 90 percent of the total output value of private industry, and many factories have moved from processing and ordering to the advanced form of state capitalism, joint state-private operation. The number of joint state-private factories was also small in the initial stage, and the way they were carried out was aimed at individual factories. Now, it has moved from the individual joint venture method to the method of merger and reorganization, and industry-wide joint venture. Beijing has already carried out industry-wide joint state-private operation in four industries, including flour, Tianjin has carried out industry-wide joint state-private operation in four industries, including paper making, and Shanghai has carried out industry-wide joint state-private operation in eight industries, including cotton spinning, creating experience for the more rapid transition of private industry to the advanced form of state capitalism in the future. In terms of private commerce, the general wholesalers in cities have basically been properly arranged, the employees have been absorbed by state-owned companies, and the vast majority of capitalists have also undergone study and happily become cadres of state-owned enterprises. Not long ago, retailers were mainly engaged in distribution and consignment sales. Now, some industries in Beijing have implemented industry-wide joint state-private operation through methods such as merging stores and joint operations, providing new methods for commercial transformation in various places. Many areas have organized handicrafts and established handicraft cooperatives. Under the leadership of supply and marketing cooperatives, small traders and peddlers in rural areas have also been largely arranged, some engaged in distribution and consignment sales, and some have become cooperative stores. The achievement of this socialist transformation of private industry and commerce should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and the government, and to the leadership and supervision of the working class. The active work of progressive elements in the industrial and commercial circles and members has also made significant contributions to the achievement of this achievement; however, we cannot be satisfied with some current achievements and stagnate. The country's entire economic construction is developing rapidly, and we must cooperate with the development of economic construction and move forward together.

    What is the overall situation of economic development in our country at present?

    The first five-year plan has been implemented for nearly three years. Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and the government, the conscious hard work of the people across the country, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the enthusiastic support of other fraternal countries, in terms of socialist industrialization and construction, 271 of the 694 industrial construction units above the quota specified in the first five-year plan will be put into production before the end of this year, and will produce many new products that our country has never produced in its history. Over the past three years, we have achieved great victories in all aspects of the national economy, forming a surge in the entire national economy.

    In the cause of realizing the socialist transformation of non-socialist economic components by the state, the enthusiasm of farmers for cooperativization is unprecedentedly high, and the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement will soon arrive. This year, the number of agricultural production cooperatives has developed to 650,000, and it will more than double by the autumn of next year. Some advanced areas have basically realized agricultural cooperativization. The development of the agricultural cooperativization movement and the development of industrialization and construction together are rapidly changing the face of the entire national economy, greatly strengthening the leadership of the socialist economy, and further incorporating the vast rural market into the state plan. All this is of great importance to the socialist transformation of our private industry and commerce.

    As we all know, the socialist economy and the capitalist economy are opposed and contradictory. With the development of the state's socialist industrialization and the arrival of the high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement, if our private industry and commerce are not further transformed, they will not be able to adapt to the new situation of economic development. It is undeniable that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is a fierce struggle between the socialist economy and the capitalist economy. In this struggle, the enthusiasm of our private industrialists and businessmen for accepting socialist transformation varies, and everyone's understanding and attitude towards transformation are not entirely consistent. Generally speaking, our industrialists and businessmen basically have several types: one is the progressive elements in the industrial and commercial circles, who have a better understanding of the policies, see the future of the country and the world clearly, are willing to wholeheartedly accept socialist transformation under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and have made contributions in practical actions. Through the continuous education of the Party and the government over the past few years, the number of our industrialists and businessmen who are learning from the advanced and actively accepting transformation is increasing day by day. Secondly, some people still do not have enough understanding of socialist transformation. They know that socialist transformation is the general trend and the socialist road has to be taken, but they are still reluctant to give up capitalist management and hope that capitalism and socialism can coexist without interfering with each other, so that when they encounter specific problems and touch their own interests, their thinking becomes blurred and wavering. Although this kind of person does not oppose transformation and many have already put their enterprises on the track of state capitalism, the degree of consciousness and willingness and the spirit of taking the initiative are still not enough, so that they are sometimes active and sometimes passive, often fluctuating and full of worries. This kind of person is quite a large number in our industrial and commercial circles. There is also a kind of person who is dissatisfied with socialist transformation and takes a passive and resistant attitude. They have adopted various passive and resistant attitudes towards socialist transformation. Since the announcement of the general task, they have withdrawn funds and operated negatively. Even if the enterprise is incorporated into the track of state capitalism, they still maintain a consistent capitalist management thinking, ignoring the interests of the state and the people, and only know how to seek profit. Among these three types of people, the first type is the advanced elements and backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles, who are respected by everyone. It is hoped that they will continue to improve themselves and become models in the cause of socialist transformation, leading the vast number of industrialists and businessmen to advance together. The second type of industrialists and businessmen are mainly due to insufficient learning, unclear direction, and poor absorption of new things, so they are worried about gains and losses. We should all help them well, unite them, and promote them to advance together. The third type of industrialists and businessmen should be said to be an obstacle to the cause of socialist transformation. But we must understand that as long as we explain the truth to them well, criticize and educate them seriously, patiently, and repeatedly, and help them correct their mistakes and gradually improve their ideological understanding, the vast majority of them can gradually adopt a positive attitude towards accepting socialist transformation. But at the same time, it must be pointed out that in our industrial and commercial circles, there are not no counter-revolutionary elements who resolutely resist transformation and oppose the people to the end. Facts have proved over the past few years that there are counter-revolutionary elements in the industrial and commercial circles who resolutely sabotage socialist transformation. These counter-revolutionary elements do not entrust their fate to the future of the country. For their own interests and for the interests of their descendants, they accept transformation, but spread rumors and sabotage, and carry out various open or covert counter-revolutionary activities. With the increasing development of socialist construction and socialist transformation, these counter-revolutionary elements who have abandoned themselves to the country and the people may still grow. We must be vigilant against these counter-revolutionary elements who have abandoned themselves to the country and the people, expose all their counter-revolutionary acts, and support the government's severe sanctions against them.

    Our industrialists and businessmen should know that our great motherland is prospering and becoming stronger at a flying speed, and the future of the country is our personal future. Our road is bright and broad, and there is no end to the work. Everyone, as long as he is willing to contribute his strength and serve the people, will have the opportunity to give play to his abilities. Therefore, we must strengthen our efforts and continue to move forward.

    × × ×

    In order to adapt to the new situation of economic development, in order to control our own destiny and unify our destiny with the future development of the country, we believe that all patriotic industrialists and businessmen will be willing to further accept transformation on the existing basis and continue to contribute their strength in the great construction cause of the great motherland. The question now is what should our industrialists and businessmen do at present? How to do it? That is, what are the tasks?

    In my opinion, the most basic responsibility and task of our industrialists and businessmen in the current great social change period is still patriotism and abiding by the law. In the past few years, our industrialists and businessmen have indeed greatly improved their understanding of patriotism and abiding by the law, and there has been a lot of progress in practical actions. However, in the industrial and commercial circles, some people think that patriotism and abiding by the law is an old saying, some people think that it is easy to be patriotic but difficult to abide by the law, and some people think that it is easy to abide by the law but difficult to be patriotic. This shows that there is insufficient understanding of the essence of patriotism and abiding by the law.

    To achieve true patriotism and abiding by the law, we must first thoroughly understand what kind of country we want to love and what kind of laws we want to abide by.

    First, let’s talk about the country. The country is not a general term, but has a certain class content. The world is now divided into two major camps. On the one hand, there are the increasingly declining capitalist countries and the colonial and semi-colonial countries under their enslavement. On the other hand, there are the increasingly prosperous and prosperous socialist countries. These are completely different in nature. If the country we love is a capitalist country, this means that we want to take the capitalist road, which is essentially to return to the old China and let imperialism and reactionaries come to slaughter us again. We all know that the people of our country have gone through more than a hundred years of heroic struggle, one after another, shed the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, and finally, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, got rid of the enslaved and exploited position of colonies and semi-colonies, and achieved the great victory of the people's revolution; the liberated Chinese people will certainly not allow imperialism and reactionaries to exploit and enslave us again, nor will they allow the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class to be transformed into a bourgeois dictatorship, allowing capitalism to spread in our country. Whoever wants to take the capitalist road is to let the reactionaries and imperialism restore in China, making China return to the tragic old road of colonies and semi-colonies. Therefore, this road is a dead end that we cannot take and the people of the country will never allow to take. In today's world capitalism has reached a dead end, according to the inevitable law of social development, our country only has the only way of socialism to take, and cannot but take. Only by taking the socialist road and building our country into a socialist country where everyone is rich can we make our country forever get rid of poverty and backwardness, so that every working people can enjoy a happy life. Therefore, we say that patriotism must be love of the socialist country, that is, patriotism must support and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, and under the leadership of the country and the working class, strive for socialist construction and accept socialist transformation, so that our country can transition from the current multi-component economic structure society, namely the new democratic society, to a socialist society.

    Let's talk about abiding by the law. We know that the law, like the country, has a certain class content. There are laws used by a few exploiters to extract the majority of people, and there are also laws that the majority of people must suppress a few counter-revolutionary elements in order to build a new society and seek a better and happier life. Our country has already promulgated the great Constitution, and has already had a series of laws, decrees, and regulations formulated according to the Constitution, all of which are to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and ensure the completion of socialist construction. Therefore, we say that abiding by the law means that we must actively strive, defend the people's democratic dictatorship, and build our country into a great socialist country on the basis of abiding by the Constitution and various laws, decrees, and regulations.

    According to these simple explanations, we can know that patriotism and abiding by the law are consistent, and there is no person who does not abide by the law who can be said to be patriotic. At the same time, we can also know that patriotism, abiding by the law, and accepting socialist transformation are consistent. Without socialist transformation, we cannot talk about patriotism and abiding by the law.

    Let me talk about socialist transformation again. Socialist transformation is a fierce struggle, which not only changes the old relations of production of enterprises, but also changes the old ideological style of each of us. We all know that the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce includes two aspects: enterprise transformation and personal transformation. In terms of enterprises, it is necessary to change capitalist private ownership into socialist public ownership. In terms of individuals, it is necessary to change oneself from an exploiter into a socialist citizen who loves labor, has labor skills, and earns a living on one's own. Undoubtedly, this is a long and arduous struggle process.

    In terms of enterprise transformation, we should strive to cooperate with the government, assist and accept the government's arrangements and transformation of us. In terms of industry, various places are launching the work of industry-wide arrangement and industry-wide transformation of private industry. During the first five-year plan period, the completion of our country's industrial production plan mainly relies on existing enterprises. Our private industry has a considerable part of potential strength, which can be brought into play and contributed to the country. The state's arrangements for our enterprises certainly have the effect of taking care of us and helping us overcome difficulties, but we cannot regard the arrangements as simply taking care of us; we must give play to our potential, do a good job in production, and actively strive for transformation in accordance with the national plan. In order to strive for transformation and be incorporated into the advanced form of state capitalism, joint state-private operation, we must confidently do a good job in the reorganization of enterprises. In the work of joint operation and factory merging, we must proceed from the perspective of the overall national interests, combine personal interests with the overall interests of the country, implement the principle of large leading small and advanced leading backward, use our strengths to help others with enthusiasm, and lead everyone to advance together and embark on the road of merger and joint operation; in enterprises that have embarked on joint state-private operation, we must learn the management methods of socialist enterprises under the leadership of the public side, so that enterprises gradually keep up with the similar state-owned economy, so as to meet the requirements of the national plan. Handicrafts still play an important role in meeting the needs of the broad masses of the people, especially in meeting the needs of production and consumption in rural areas. Capitalist handicrafts must be reorganized and transformed under the leadership and arrangement of the state, and embark on the road of state capitalism; individual handicraftsmen must actively organize themselves through mutual assistance and cooperation, improve product quality, and be incorporated into the national plan.

    In terms of commerce, some areas are currently carrying out merger and joint operation work on the basis of unified arrangements, and have created the experience of the new method of industry-wide joint state-private operation. Our industrialists and businessmen must improve business management and reduce expenses under the leadership of the relevant local party and government departments and under the supervision of the workers, and do a good job in preparing for merger and joint operation from the overall interests of socialist transformation. In the process of transformation, we must change the capitalist management style, establish the idea of serving production and consumers, and assist state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce in doing a good job in commodity circulation. Rural small traders and peddlers should do a good job in distribution and consignment sales according to the plan under the leadership of the supply and marketing cooperatives, and strive for transformation through mutual assistance and cooperation.

    It must be pointed out that practicing economy is an important principle of socialist enterprise management. In order to realize the socialist industrialization of the country, the source of funds in our country mainly relies on saving. The first five-year plan requires the people of the whole country: "In order to successfully complete and strive to overfulfill the first five-year plan, and to make the first five-year plan create a good start for future long-term economic construction, it is necessary to launch a regular and comprehensive movement to practice economy and oppose waste throughout the country." At present, there is serious waste in the production and enterprise management of private industry and commerce; in order to accumulate funds for the country, and also in order to improve the business management of our own enterprises, we must, under the premise of ensuring product quality, take practicing economy and opposing waste as one of the contents of accepting socialist transformation.

    The state's socialist transformation of private industry and commerce not only transforms enterprises, but also transforms people; to be more specific, we must combine the transformation of enterprises with the transformation of industrialists and businessmen. The reason why we emphasize that industrialists and businessmen must take the initiative to play a role in enterprises and do a good job is of course for the direct purpose of the transformation of enterprises, and equally important is also for the transformation of people. Enterprise transformation is the material basis for the transformation of people. Only by constantly improving ourselves in the process of enterprise transformation can we gradually transform ourselves. There is a fundamental difference between the management of socialist enterprises and the management of capitalist enterprises. The former is for the interests of the country and the people, while the latter is only for the purpose of making money for individuals. Therefore, after our industrialists and businessmen put their enterprises on the track of state capitalism and the relations of production have been initially changed, they must take the attitude of learning from scratch, actively and hard study the methods of socialist enterprise management, gradually transform their thinking, and establish the concept of serving the people. It must be understood that if there is any difference between the transformation of people and the transformation of enterprises, it is that the transformation of people needs to rely more on their own initiative and give play to their initiative. If we ourselves do not actively and diligently, and cannot improve our socialist consciousness during the transition period and learn our skills well, but continue to follow the old ways day by day, then although socialist transformation has a considerable period of time, this period of time will also pass quickly. The main thing for us to recognize our future and control our destiny is that we ourselves can look forward, see wider, see farther, stand on the progressive side, seize the time, and transform ourselves.

    In order to defend the fruits of our country's revolution and ensure the completion of the five-year plan, another important task of our industrialists and businessmen at present is to actively participate in the struggle to eliminate all counter-revolutionary elements. During the great social change period, the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution is very fierce, sharp, and complex. The victory of our socialist construction and socialist transformation is to establish a solid foundation for our country to build a socialist society and forever cut off the roots of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries' restoration in China. This is bound to be envied and hated by the enemies of our people. The greater our victory, the more frantic the conspiracies of imperialism and reactionaries will inevitably be. Therefore, our patriotic industrialists and businessmen must further draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy and resolutely fight against all counter-revolutionary elements who sabotage our socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    In the six years since liberation, under the education and cultivation of the Party and the government, the people of our country have generally improved their ideological understanding and patriotism. The vast majority of our compatriots are loyal to the motherland and love the great socialist future of the motherland, and the number of counter-revolutionary elements lurking in the country is extremely small. However, the seriousness of the harm caused by counter-revolutionary elements to the country and the people does not lie in the number of people. If we allow them to carry out their activities, even a very small number of counter-revolutionary elements can bring us incomparable harm. In order to defend our great construction, we must fully improve revolutionary vigilance and assist the government in eliminating all open and hidden counter-revolutionary elements, and smash the sabotage activities of domestic and foreign enemies against our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation.

    The vast majority of our industrialists and businessmen are good people, but in the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, our weakness is that many people have a serious tendency of not asking about politics, and they are not vigilant against counter-revolutionary elements and are easily exploited by counter-revolutionary elements and used by counter-revolutionary elements. At the same time, as I said above, with the development of the socialist transformation, the enthusiasm of our industrialists and businessmen for accepting transformation varies. Some people adopt a passive and resistant attitude towards transformation. If this kind of person does not repent in time and immediately correct their mistakes, and if they continue to develop, they may be pulled over by counter-revolutionary elements and become counter-revolutionary elements. At the same time, we must recognize that there are still some counter-revolutionary elements in the industrial and commercial circles who resolutely resist socialist transformation and sabotage socialist construction. The facts revealed in various places in the past few months deserve our serious vigilance.

    Fellow Committee Members, I have heard that a few industrialists and businessmen have some concerns in their minds about the movement to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements, such as they are afraid of being implicated, etc. This is completely unnecessary. Because good people are always good people, and counter-revolutionary elements are always counter-revolutionary elements. The line is clear and will not be confused. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us that on the one hand, we must not let a counter-revolutionary element slip through the net, and on the other hand, we must never wrong a good person; we must seek truth from facts and make a comprehensive analysis of everything. Even if some people have had various relationships with counter-revolutionary elements in the past, as long as they explain to the government, they can explain clearly; even if there are still counter-revolutionary activities now, under the country's policy of leniency for confession and rewards for meritorious service, as long as they can thoroughly repent, confess, and perform meritorious service in the movement, the government will definitely deal with them appropriately according to the circumstances.

    In the great struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements launched throughout the country, in order to purify the ranks of the industrial and commercial circles, all patriotic industrialists and businessmen must improve their ideological understanding, open their eyes, so that they can distinguish all the conspiracies of counter-revolutionary elements, stand firm on the people's position, draw a clear line between ourselves and the enemy, assist the government, and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate the open and hidden counter-revolutionary elements. At the same time, we must conduct propaganda and education for those industrialists and businessmen who have unclear understanding and ideological paralysis, help them improve their understanding, distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and join the struggle to eliminate counter-revolutionary elements.

    Fellow Committee Members, the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce is arduous, and the responsibility of each of us is great. However, with the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and the supervision of the workers, we have full confidence that we can gradually transform our enterprises and individuals through the road stipulated by the Constitution, and with the development of socialist construction, successfully complete the cause of socialist transformation.

    In the past few years, the facts in various places have proved that the advanced elements and backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles have played a great role in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce. All the committee members present here are leaders of the industrial and commercial federations and advanced elements and backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles, and have done a lot of useful work for the country and the industrial and commercial circles. You know more about the experience in this regard than I do. In addition to expressing my respect to you and learning from you, there is one thing that must be pointed out, that is, in the face of the new situation of the country's socialist economic construction and socialist transformation, the responsibility of the advanced elements and backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles is even greater than before, that is to say, your responsibility is also greater than before.

    In the past few years, we have often heard people ask, what are advanced elements and backbone elements? What are the standards? This question seems very complicated and abstract, but in fact it is easy to explain. In my opinion, the characteristics of advanced elements and backbone elements are that, first of all, under the leadership of the Party and the government, through continuous self-education and self-transformation, they can look forward, see wider, see farther, see the historical process of China's social development, see the bright future of socialism, and not be afraid of socialism, so that they can control their own destiny, consciously and happily accept socialist transformation, and actively participate in the glorious ranks of our country's socialist construction. In fact, our great motherland has been on the road of socialist advancement for six years, and we must take the socialist road and we will definitely be able to build a socialist society. This is already an extremely obvious objective law. However, in our industrial and commercial circles, there are still some people who cannot look wider and farther, cannot see the superiority of socialism, cannot see the example of the Soviet Union's great communist construction, cannot see the development of our country's national economy in the past six years, and cannot see their own future. They cling to the old stall and are unwilling to make any changes, just fearing that socialist transformation will make them lose the means of production. In fact, in socialist society, what is lost is only some privately owned means of production, and the entire socialist property is publicly owned by the people of the whole country. Our industrialists and businessmen, after transformation, become citizens of socialist society, and our material and cultural living standards will also continue to improve and improve. Socialism is to make everyone rich, and more and more rich. The responsibility of advanced elements and backbone elements is to tell others what we know and what we see, so that others can also see wider and farther, tell everyone the superiority of socialism and the truth that socialism will surely win, and help everyone strengthen their confidence in taking the socialist road.

    Advanced elements and backbone elements are valued by everyone not only because they know more than others, but also because they can be consistent in word and deed and put what they think is right into practice in action. In the cause of socialist transformation, the valuable thing about advanced elements and backbone elements is that they can set an example and take a step ahead of ordinary people. The achievements made in the socialist transformation of private industry and commerce in our country in the past few years are inseparable from the demonstration and leading role of advanced elements and backbone elements. Due to the leading role and demonstration of advanced elements and backbone elements, some industrialists and businessmen have gradually realized the future of the country and the superiority of socialism, thus gradually improving their enthusiasm for accepting socialist transformation.

    In the past few years, with the progress of the cause of socialist transformation, advanced elements and backbone elements in our industrial and commercial circles have been constantly growing and emerging, becoming a core force. However, it must be known that with the development of the entire economic situation, the cause of socialist transformation is also deepening step by step and becoming more and more complicated step by step. In order to meet the requirements of the new situation, the advanced elements and backbone elements in our industrial and commercial circles should shoulder a more important responsibility, must closely rely on the Party and the government, closely connect with the masses, learn from the masses and work for the masses under the leadership of the Party and the government; in the work, we must not be impatient and rash, so as to detach ourselves from reality and the masses, nor can we stagnate and fall behind the development of the situation; we must be modest, have a humble attitude, and never be complacent just because we have done some work and have some achievements; at the same time, we must not lose confidence and shrink back in the face of difficulties in the work; in the work, we must boldly represent the legitimate interests of the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen, reflect their reasonable demands, so as to connect with the masses and get along with everyone, and at the same time, we must strictly expose their illegal acts and give necessary criticism to their erroneous ideas, so that we can play a bridge role between the government and the industrialists and businessmen and help everyone to progress together. In order to meet the needs of work under the new situation, we must also discover, unite, and cultivate more activists, and encourage the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen to play a certain positive role. It must be known that this is not only for the overall interests of the country's socialist construction, but also for the interests of our industrial and commercial circles. Our advanced elements and backbone elements constantly and consistently do good things for the people and the country and make contributions, and the people and the country will not forget. At present, they will be valued by the people, and in the future socialist society, they will also get appropriate work and the position they deserve.

    × × ×

    Fellow Committee Members, in the past few years, our industrial and commercial federations at all levels, under the leadership of the relevant local party and government departments, have made certain achievements in uniting the broad masses of industrialists and businessmen, carrying out propaganda and education, and assisting the government in making arrangements for transformation. Now, the cause of socialist transformation has made new developments, and the work of our industrial and commercial federations is not to be weakened, but to be further strengthened on the existing basis. It is undeniable that we have many shortcomings in our past work. If we cannot further improve our work and do a good job in our work, then our industrial and commercial federation organizations will not be able to assume their due responsibilities, cannot play their due role, and cannot complete their due tasks. All the committee members are leaders of the industrial and commercial federations and advanced elements and backbone elements in the industrial and commercial circles. We must work hard, overcome difficulties, carry out criticism and self-criticism, guard against arrogance and rashness, help each other and encourage each other, correct the shortcomings in our work, and bravely and actively shoulder our important responsibilities and complete our glorious tasks in the face of the new situation.

    Our great motherland is like the rising sun, shining brightly. Our socialist construction and socialist transformation are advancing at an unprecedented speed in our country's history. This meeting is held under this new situation. Our great leader Chairman Mao cares about us affectionately and invited us to discuss and taught us in detail, indicating the direction for us to further our efforts. The relevant party and government departments and leaders have given us valuable guidance and assistance, enabling us to have a good meeting. This is the most important meeting since the Congress of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Let us, under the leadership of the great Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, fully bring into play the strength of each of us, and work together to complete the great cause that our predecessors have never done before, and advance towards socialist society with full confidence. Let us shout:

    Long live the People's Republic of China!
    Long live the Communist Party of China!
    Long Live the great leader Chairman Mao!

     适应国家的社会主义经济建设发展的形势，为进一步推动全国工商业者积极接受社会主义改造而奋斗
　　——中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会第二次
　　会议开幕词中华全国工商业联合会执行委员会主任委员陈叔通各位委员：
    现在，中华全国工商业联合会第一届执行委员会第二次会议开幕了。从一九五三年十一月第一次会议召开以来，到现在已经两年。就在这两年中，我们伟大的祖国宣布了过渡时期的总任务，公布了中华人民共和国宪法，明确地规定了我国走社会主义的道路，鼓舞了全国人民建设社会主义的积极性。我国在国民经济恢复的基础上，开始了发展国民经济的第一个五年计划建设，现在快将完成第三个年度计划，全国人民正在为超额完成这个计划而加倍地努力。第一个五年计划的完成，将开始改变我国百年来经济落后的历史，把我国向工业化的社会主义社会的目标推进一步，保证我国在几个五年计划后建设成为富强、幸福的社会主义社会。
    我国在过渡时期的总任务，是以实现国家的社会主义工业化为中心，并在国家的社会主义工业化的基础上，对农业、手工业和对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造。第一个五年计划的基本任务，便是集中主要力量发展重工业，建立我国的社会主义工业化的初步基础；发展部分集体所有制的农业生产合作社，并发展手工业生产合作社，建立对于农业和手工业的社会主义改造的初步基础；基本上把资本主义工商业分别地纳入各种形式的国家资本主义的轨道，建立对于私营工商业的社会主义改造的基础。以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主政权，使我国能够依靠国家机关和社会力量，通过社会主义工业化和对非社会主义成份的社会主义改造，保证逐步消灭剥削制度，建立社会主义社会。我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，引起各国人民的重视，是具有重大的国际意义的。
    各位委员，我们这次会议在这个时候召开，是有重大的意义的。李富春副总理指出：“我国建设社会主义的事业，是以社会主义工业化为主体的，而对农业、手工业的改造和对资本主义工商业的改造是两个必要的组成部分，这三者是不可分割的。”现在，第一个五年计划正在顺利地进行，农业合作化运动的高潮就将在全国范围内出现。国家对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造也有了新的发展。许多资本主义工商业以及手工业和小商小贩已经逐步地走上了国家资本主义和合作化的道路；许多低级形式和中级形式的国家资本主义企业，已逐步纳入高级形式。目前，国家采取统筹安排、经济改组、按业改造等新方式，对私营工商业进行改造，这标志着国家对资本主义工商业实行社会主义改造，向前迈进了一步。所以，随着经济建设高涨和农业合作化高潮的到来，在国家对私营工商业社会主义改造的新的形势下，我们工商业者更有必要进一步加强努力，随着整个国民经济的发展而一同前进。
    两年来，国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造，有了很大的发展。私营工业方面，在有计划的经济建设的初期，是以国家资本主义的中级形式，即加工、定货、统购、包销为主体，但不少私营工厂还是自产自销，无组织的自由市场还占相当大的比重。今年上半年由国家加工、定货、统购、包销和收购的产品价值，已占到全部私营工业产值的百分之九十以上，并有许多工厂已由加工、定货走上了国家资本主义高级形式的公私合营。公私合营的工厂，在初期也是不多的，而且进行的方式都是以个别工厂为对象，现在已由个别的合营方式进到合并改组、全业合营的方式。北京已有面粉等四个行业，天津已有造纸等四个行业，上海已有棉纺等八个行业，都进行了全业公私合营，为今后私营工业较迅速地走上国家资本主义高级形式创造了经验。私营商业方面，城市一般的批发商基本上都已妥善安排，职工已由国营公司吸收，极大多数资方也都经过学习，愉快地成为国营企业干部。零售商在不久前还只以经销、代销形式为主，现在北京市有的行业经过并店联营等方式，已实行全业公私合营，为各地商业改造提供了新的方式。许多地区的手工业已组织起来，成立了手工业合作社。农村的小商小贩在供销合作社的领导下，也大体上获得了安排，有的进行经销、代销，有的成为合作商店。对私营工商业的社会主义改造的这种成就，应该归功于党和政府的英明领导，归功于工人阶级的领导和监督。各地工商界进步分子和各位委员的积极工作，对于这种成就的获得也有显著的贡献；但是，我们不能满足于目前的一些成就，就停滞不前。国家整个经济建设正在迅速发展，我们必须配合经济建设的发展而一同前进。
    目前我国经济发展总的形势是怎样呢？
    第一个五年计划执行将近三年，由于党和政府的英明领导、全国人民自觉的辛勤劳动，又由于苏联的无私援助和其他兄弟国家的热诚支持，在社会主义工业化建设方面，第一个五年计划规定的限额以上的六百九十四个工业建设单位，有二百七十一个将在今年年底前投入生产，将出产我国历史上从未生产过的许多新产品。三年来，我们在国民经济的各个方面，都取得了很大的胜利，形成了整个国民经济的高涨。
    在国家对非社会主义经济成份实现社会主义改造事业方面，农民走合作化的积极性正在空前高涨，农业合作化运动的高潮就将迅速到来。今年农业生产合作社已经发展到六十五万个，到明年秋季将再增加一倍以上，有一些先进的地区基本上实现了农业合作化。农业合作化运动的发展和工业化建设的发展一起，正在迅速地改变着整个国民经济的面貌，大大地加强着社会主义经济领导的力量，并使国内广大的农村市场进一步纳入国家计划轨道。这一切对于我们私营工商业的社会主义改造都有重大的关系。
    我们大家知道，社会主义经济和资本主义经济是对立的、矛盾的。随着国家的社会主义工业化的发展和农业合作化运动高潮的到来，我们的私营工商业如不进一步进行改造，那就不能适应经济发展的新形势。不容讳言，私营工商业的社会主义改造，是社会主义经济和资本主义经济之间的激烈斗争。在这一斗争中，我们私营工商业者接受社会主义改造的积极性是参差不齐的，各人对改造的认识和态度是不全一致的。大体说来，我们工商业者基本上有这样几种类型：一种是工商界的进步分子，他们比较了解政策，看清国家和世界的前途，愿意全心全意地在共产党和毛主席领导下，积极地接受社会主义改造，并在实际行动中作出了贡献。这几年来经过党和政府对我们不断的教育，我们工商业者向先进看齐、积极接受改造的人，正在一天比一天地多起来。其次，有一种人对社会主义改造的认识还是不够的。他们明知社会主义改造是大势所趋，社会主义的道路不得不走，但仍对资本主义的经营恋恋不舍，希望资本主义和社会主义能够互不干扰，同时并存，以致遇到具体问题，触及本身利益，思想就模糊起来，摇摆不定。这种人虽然也不反对改造，并有很多已把自己的企业纳入国家资本主义的轨道，但自觉自愿的程度和积极主动的精神还很不够，以致时而积极，时而消极，常常动荡不定，顾虑重重。这种人，在我们工商界中，相当的多。还有一种是对社会主义改造心存不满而采取消极抗拒的人。他们对社会主义改造采取了各种消极抗拒的态度，自总任务宣布以来，抽逃资金，消极经营，即使企业纳入了国家资本主义轨道，也仍保持一贯的资本主义经营思想，不顾国家和人民的利益，只知唯利是图。在这三种人中，第一种类型的人是工商界中的先进分子、骨干分子，受到我们大家的尊重，希望他们继续不断地提高自己，使自己成为社会主义改造事业中的模范，带动广大工商业者一同前进。第二种类型的工商业者，主要是由于学习不够，方向不明，对新事物的吸收比较差，因此，患得患失。我们大家应该好好地帮助他们，团结他们，推动他们一同前进。第三种类型的工商业者，应该说，是对社会主义改造事业有阻碍的。但我们必须了解，只要我们向他们好好地说明道理，严肃地、耐心地、反复地加以批评教育，帮助他们改正错误，逐步提高他们的思想认识，他们之中绝大多数人，是可以逐步地对接受社会主义改造采取积极态度的。但同时，必须指出，在我们工商界中，并不是没有坚决抗拒改造、和人民作对到底的反革命分子的存在。几年来事实证明，在工商界中，是存在着坚决破坏社会主义改造的反革命分子的。这些反革命分子并不把自己的命运寄托在国家的前途上面，为自己的利益也为自己后代的利益，接受改造，而是造谣破坏，进行各种公开的或隐蔽的反革命活动。随着社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的日益发展，这种自绝于国家和人民的反革命分子，还可能有新的滋长。对于这些自绝于国家和人民的反革命分子，我们必须提高警惕，揭露他们的一切反革命行为，拥护政府对他们的严厉制裁。
    我们工商业者应该知道，我们伟大的祖国正以飞跃的速度在繁荣富强起来，国家的前途就是我们个人的前途。我们的道路是光明的，是广阔的，工作是做不完的。每一个人只要他愿意贡献他的力量，为人民服务，都会有他发挥能力的机会。所以，我们必须加强努力，不断前进。

    为了适应经济发展的新形势，为了掌握我们自己的命运，把自己的命运和国家发展的前途统一起来，我们相信，一切爱国的工商业者会愿意在现有的基础上进一步地接受改造，在伟大祖国的伟大建设事业中，继续贡献自己的力量。现在的问题是我们工商业者当前应该做些什么？怎样做？也就是有哪些任务？
    我认为，我们工商业者在当前伟大的社会变革时期，最起码的也是最基本的责任和任务，仍然是爱国守法。这几年来，我们工商业者对于爱国守法的认识的确已有很大的提高，在实际行动中也有不少的进步。但在工商界中，有的人以为爱国守法已是老生常谈，也有人认为爱国容易守法难，还有人认为守法容易爱国难。这说明对爱国守法的实质是认识不足的。
    我们要做到真正的爱国守法，首先必须彻底明白我们要爱的是什么样的国家，我们要守的是什么样的法律。
    先说国家。国家不是一个笼统的名词，而是有其一定的阶级内容的。现在世界已分成两大阵营，一方面有日趋没落的资本主义的国家及其奴役下的殖民地、半殖民地的国家，另一方面则有日益富强繁荣的社会主义的国家。这在性质上是完全不同的。假如我们所爱的国家是资本主义国家，这就是意味着我们要走资本主义的道路，在实质上就是回复到旧中国的道路，让帝国主义和反动派再来宰割我们。我们大家都知道，我国人民经过了一百多年来前仆后继的英勇奋斗，流尽了无数革命先烈的鲜血，终于在中国共产党领导下，摆脱了殖民地、半殖民地的被奴役、被剥削的地位，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利；解放了的中国人民固然决不会允许帝国主义和反动派再来剥削、奴役我们，同样也决不会允许把工人阶级领导的人民民主专政变为资产阶级专政，让资本主义在我国泛滥。谁要妄想走资本主义的道路、那就是让反动派和帝国主义在中国复辟，使中国退回到殖民地、半殖民地悲惨的老路上去。所以，这条道路是我们不能走的、全国人民决不允许走的死路。在世界资本主义已经走到绝路的今日，根据社会发展的必然规律，我国只有社会主义这条唯一的道路可走，而且不能不走。只有走社会主义道路，把我国建设成为一个大家富裕的社会主义国家，才能使我国永远摆脱贫穷落后，使每一个爱劳动的人民都能享受幸福生活。因之，我们说爱国，必然是爱社会主义国家，也就是说，爱国就必须拥护和巩固以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政，在国家和工人阶级的领导下，努力社会主义建设和接受社会主义改造，使我国由目前多成份的经济结构的社会，即新民主主义社会，过渡到社会主义社会。
    再说守法。我们知道法律也和国家一样，是具有一定的阶级内容的。有少数剥削者用以榨取多数人的法律，也有多数人为了建设新社会，寻求美好的幸福生活，因而必须同时镇压少数反革命分子的法律。我国已经公布了伟大的宪法，而且已经有了根据宪法而制订的一系列的法律、法令和规章，都是为了巩固人民民主专政，保证完成社会主义建设。所以，我们说守法，这就意味着我们要在遵守宪法和各种法律、法令、规章的基础上，积极努力，保卫人民民主专政，把我国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家。
    根据这些简单的说明，我们就可以知道，爱国与守法是一致的，决没有不守法的人而可以说是爱国的。同时，我们也可以知道，爱国守法和接受社会主义改造又是一致的，离开了社会主义改造，我们就谈不到爱国守法。
    我再来说一下社会主义改造。社会主义改造是一场激烈斗争，不但要改变企业的旧的生产关系，而且要改变我们每个人的旧的思想作风。我们都知道，私营工商业社会主义改造包括企业改造和个人改造两方面。企业方面要改变资本主义私有制为社会主义公有制，个人方面要把自己从一个剥削者改变成为一个爱好劳动、具有劳动技能、自食其力的社会主义公民。无疑的，这是一个长期的艰巨的斗争过程。
    我们在企业改造方面，应该努力配合政府，协助和接受政府对我们的安排和改造。工业方面，各地正在展开对私营工业的全业安排、按业改造的工作。在第一个五年计划时期，我国工业生产计划的完成，主要是依靠原有企业。我们私营工业具有相当大的一部分潜在力量，可以发挥出来，贡献给国家。国家对于我们企业的安排，固然是具有照顾我们、帮助我们克服困难的作用，但我们不能把安排视为单纯的照顾；必须在统一安排下，按照国家计划，发挥我们的潜力，搞好生产，积极争取改造。为了争取改造，纳入国家资本主义高级形式的公私合营，我们必须满怀信心地作好企业的改组工作。在联营并厂工作中，必须从整个国家利益的观点出发，把个人的利益和国家的整体的利益结合起来，贯彻以大带小、以先进带落后的原则，以自己的所长，满怀热情地去帮助别人，带动大家一同前进，走上合并合营的道路；在已走上公私合营的企业，必须在公方领导下，学会社会主义企业的经营管理方法，使企业逐步向同类的国营经济看齐，以完成国家计划的要求。手工业在满足广大人民的需要，尤其是满足农村中的生产和消费的需要方面，仍有重大的作用。资本主义手工业必须在国家的领导和安排下，进行改组和改造，走上国家资本主义道路；个体手工业者必须通过互助合作，积极组织起来，改进产品质量，纳入国家计划。
    商业方面，目前有的地区在统一安排的基础上，正在展开合并合营工作，已经创造了全业公私合营新方式的经验。我们工商业者必须在当地党政有关部门领导下，在工人群众的监督下，改善经营管理，降低开支费用，从社会主义改造的整体利益出发，做好合并合营准备工作。在改造过程中，必须改变资本主义经营作风，树立为生产及消费者服务的思想，协助国营商业和合作社营商业做好商品流转工作。乡村小商小贩应在供销合作社领导下，按照计划，做好经销、代销工作，通过互助合作方式，努力争取改造。
    必须指出，厉行节约是社会主义企业经营管理的重要原则。我国为了实现国家的社会主义工业化，资金来源主要是依靠节约。第一个五年计划要求全国人民：“为着胜利地完成和力求超额完成第一个五年计划，并使第一个五年计划能够为将来长期经济建设造成一个良好的开端，必须在全国范围内开展一个经常性的全面的厉行节约、反对浪费的运动。”目前私营工商业在生产和企业管理上存在着严重的浪费现象；为了给国家积累资金，同样也为了改善自己企业的经营管理，必须在保证产品质量的前提下，把厉行节约、反对浪费工作，作为接受社会主义改造的内容之一。
    国家对私营工商业的社会主义改造，不仅要改造企业，而且要改造人；更明确地说，必须把改造企业和改造工商业者的工作结合起来。我们所以强调工商业者必须在企业中主动地发挥力量，做好工作，其直接目的固然是为了企业的改造，同样重要的也是为了人的改造。企业改造是人的改造的物质基础，我们只有在企业改造过程中，不断提高自己，才能逐步改造自己。社会主义企业的经营管理和资本主义企业的经营管理是有原则上区别的。前者是为了国家和人民的利益，后者则只是为了个人赚钱的目的。所以，我们工商业者在企业纳入国家资本主义轨道，生产关系初步改变以后，就必须抱从头学起的态度，积极地努力学习社会主义企业经营管理的方法，逐步改造自己的思想，建立为人民服务的观点。必须明白，人的改造和企业的改造如有什么区别的话，那就是人的改造更需要依靠自己的主动，发挥自己的积极性。我们自己如不主动地积极努力，不能在过渡时期提高社会主义觉悟，好好地学会本领，而一天一天地因循下去，则社会主义改造虽有相当长的一段时间，这一段时间也是很快就会过去的。我们要认识自己的前途，掌握自己的命运，主要的是要我们自己能够向前看，看得广，看得远，站在进步方面，抓紧时间，改造自己。
    为了保卫我国革命胜利的果实，保证五年计划的完成，目前我们工商业者的另一重要任务是积极地投入肃清一切反革命分子的斗争。在伟大的社会变革时期，革命和反革命的斗争是非常激烈、尖锐、复杂的。我们社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的胜利，是为我国建设社会主义社会建立稳固的基础，永远斩断帝国主义和蒋介石反动派在中国复辟的根源。这必然为我国人民的敌人所嫉妒痛恨。我们的胜利愈大，帝国主义和反动派的阴谋破坏也必然愈加疯狂。所以，我们爱国的工商业者必须进一步地划清敌我界限，向一切破坏我们社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的反革命分子作坚决的斗争。
    解放六年来，我国人民在党和政府的教育和培养下，一般地都已提高了思想认识和爱国主义精神。我们极大多数的同胞都是忠诚于祖国，热爱祖国伟大的社会主义前途的，潜伏在国内的反革命分子是为数极少的。但是，反革命分子对国家对人民危害的严重性并不在于人数的多少，如我们放任其活动，即使极少数的反革命分子，也可以给我们带来无可比拟的损害。为了保卫我们伟大的建设，我们必须充分提高革命的警惕性，协助政府肃清一切公开的和暗藏的反革命分子，粉碎国内外敌人对我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的破坏活动。
    我们工商界中极大多数都是好人，但在肃清反革命分子的斗争中，我们的弱点就是有许多人带着严重的不问政治的倾向，对反革命分子的警惕性不高，容易被反革命分子钻空子，为反革命分子所利用。同时，我在上面说过，随着社会主义改造事业的发展，我们工商业者接受改造的积极性是参差不齐的。有些人对改造采取消极抗拒的态度。这种人如不及时悔悟，立即纠正自己的错误，发展下去，就有可能为反革命分子拉过去，变为反革命分子。同时，我们必须认识到：工商界中还有一些坚决抗拒社会主义改造和破坏社会主义建设事业的反革命分子。在过去几个月中，各地所揭露出来的事实，是值得我们严重警惕的。
    各位委员，我听说有少数工商业者对于肃清反革命分子运动在思想上存在着多少顾虑，如他们怕被牵连等等。这是完全不必要的。因为好人总是好人，反革命分子总是反革命分子，界限分明，不会被混淆起来的。毛主席一再指示我们，一方面不能让一个反革命分子漏网，一方面决不冤枉一个好人；对于任何事情都要实事求是，加以全面分析。有些人即使过去和反革命分子有过各种不同的关系，只要向政府交代，是可以说得明白的；就是现在还有反革命活动，在国家的坦白从宽、立功有赏的政策下，只要能够彻底悔悟，坦白交代，并在运动中立功，政府是一定会分别情况，适当处理的。
    在全国展开肃清反革命分子的伟大斗争中，为了纯洁工商界的队伍，一切爱国的工商业者必须提高思想认识，擦亮眼睛，使自己能够辨别反革命分子的一切阴谋诡计，站稳人民立场，划清敌我界限，协助政府，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地把公开的和隐藏的反革命分子肃清出去。同时，对于那些认识不清、思想麻痹的工商业者要进行宣传教育，帮助他们提高认识，分清敌我，投入肃清反革命分子斗争中去。

    各位委员，私营工商业的社会主义改造工作是艰巨的，我们每一个人的责任是重大的。但是，有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，有工人群众的监督，我们有充分的信心，可以通过宪法所规定的道路，逐步改造我们的企业和个人，随着社会主义建设的发展，胜利地完成社会主义改造的事业。
    几年来，各地事实证明，在私营工商业的社会主义改造中，工商界的先进分子、骨干分子是起着很大的作用的。在座的各位委员都是各地工商业联合会的领导人和工商界的先进分子、骨干分子都曾给国家和工商界做了不少有益的工作。对于这方面的经验，各位比我知道得多，我除了向各位表示敬意，要向各位学习以外，有一点必须提出，就是，在国家的社会主义经济建设和社会主义改造事业新的形势面前，工商界的先进分子、骨干分子的责任是比以前更为重大了，也就是说，各位的责任也是比以前更为重大了。
    这几年来，我们时常听到有人问，什么是先进分子、骨干分子？有什么标准呢？这个问题似乎是很复杂、很抽象，但事实上也是容易说得明白的。我认为，先进分子、骨干分子的特点，首先是他们在党和政府的领导下，经过不断的自我教育和自我改造，能够向前看，看得广，看得远，看出中国社会发展的历史进程，看到社会主义光明的前途，不害怕社会主义，因而能掌握自己的命运，自觉地、愉快地接受社会主义改造，积极参加我国社会主义建设的光荣行列。事实上，我们的伟大祖国已在社会主义前进的道路上走了六年，我们一定要走社会主义道路，一定能够建成社会主义社会，这已是极为明显的客观规律。但是，在我们工商界中，仍然有一些人不能把目光放得大一些、远一些，看不到社会主义的优越性，看不到苏联伟大的共产主义建设的榜样，看不到我国六年来的国民经济的发展，看不清自己的前途，死守着旧摊子不愿有所改变，就怕社会主义改造会使他们失去生产资料。实际上，到了社会主义社会，失掉的仅是一些私有的生产资料，整个社会主义财产都是全国人民所公有的。我们工商业者经过改造，成为社会主义社会的公民，我们的物质和文化生活水平同样地将不断地获得提高和改善。社会主义就是要使大家都富裕，而且越来越富裕。先进分子、骨干分子的责任就是要把我们自己所知道、所看到的，告诉别人，使别人也能看得广些、远些，把社会主义的优越性和社会主义必定胜利的道理，告诉大家，帮助大家坚定走社会主义道路的信心。
    先进分子、骨干分子所以受到大家重视，决不仅仅因为他们比别人知道得多些，而是因为他们能够表里相符，言行一致，把自己所认为正确的在行动上予以实践。在社会主义改造事业中，先进分子、骨干分子可贵的地方就是能够以身作则，比一般人先行一步。这几年来，我国私营工商业社会主义改造所取得的成就，是和先进分子、骨干分子的示范、带头作用分不开的。由于先进分子、骨干分子的带头和示范，使一些工商业者逐步认识国家前途和社会主义的优越性，因而逐步提高了接受社会主义改造的积极性。
    几年来，随着社会主义改造事业的进展，我们工商界中的先进分子、骨干分子正在不断地成长和涌现出来，成为一种核心力量。但是，必须知道，随着整个经济形势的发展，社会主义改造事业也是一步步地深入，一步步地复杂起来。为了适应新的形势的要求，我们工商界的先进分子、骨干分子，应该负起更重大的责任，必须紧密地靠拢党和政府，密切地联系群众，在党和政府领导下，向群众学习，为群众工作；在工作中，不能急躁冒进，以致脱离实际，脱离群众，也不能停滞不进，落在形势发展的后面；必须虚怀若谷，态度谦逊，决不因自己作了一些工作，有了一些成就，就自命不凡；同时，工作中遇到困难，也不要丧失信心，畏缩不前；在工作中必须大胆地代表广大工商业者的合法利益，反映他们的合理要求，才能联系群众，和大家打成一片，同时又必须对他们的不法行为，予以严格的揭露，对于他们的错误思想，予以必要的批评，才能在政府和工商业者之间，发挥桥梁作用，帮助大家共同进步。为了适应新形势下工作的需要，我们还要发掘、团结、培养更多的积极分子，鼓舞广大的工商业者都能发挥一定的积极作用。必须知道，这不但是为了国家的社会主义建设的整个利益，也是为了我们工商界的利益。我们的先进分子、骨干分子不断地、一贯地对人民、对国家做好事，有贡献，人民和国家是不会忘记的。在目前，他们会受到人民的重视，到将来社会主义社会时，他们也会得到适当的工作和应有的地位。

    各位委员，在过去几年中，我们各级工商业联合会在当地党政有关部门的领导下，对于团结广大工商业者，进行宣传教育，协助政府进行安排改造，是有一定成绩的。现在，社会主义改造事业已经有了新的发展，我们工商业联合会的工作不是削弱，而是要在已有的基础上进一步地加强。无庸讳言，我们在过去工作中的缺点是不少的。我们如不能进一步改进我们的工作，做好我们的工作，则我们工商业联合会组织就不能负起应有的责任，不能发挥应有的作用，不能完成应有的任务。各位委员都是工商业联合会的领导人和工商界的先进分子、骨干分子，我们必须努力工作，克服困难，展开批评与自我批评，戒骄戒躁，互助互勉，纠正我们工作中的缺点，勇敢地积极地在新形势面前负起我们的重大责任，完成我们的光荣任务。
    我们伟大的祖国正如旭日东升，光芒万丈。我们的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业，正以我国历史上从来未有的速度，一日千里地向前迈进。我们这次会议就是在这种新的形势下召开的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲切地关怀着我们，邀集了我们座谈，对我们谆谆教导，详尽地指示了我们进一步努力的方向。党政有关部门和各位首长都给予了我们宝贵的指导和帮助，使我们能够很好地开好这次会议。这是中华全国工商业联合会代表大会以来一次最重要的会议。让我们在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，充分地发挥我们每个人的力量，共同为完成我们前人所从来没有做过的伟大事业而努力，满怀信心地向着社会主义社会前进吧。让我们高呼：
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！
