　　Chander, a famous Indian writer and screenwriter, said that the warm cheers of Chinese audiences for Indian films were a friendly expression of six hundred million people to four hundred million people. He hoped that such friendly gatherings could last forever.
　　When asked about how to strengthen cultural exchanges between China and India in the future, Kapoor said, our great leader and Premier have said that since there are many things in common between China and India, it is natural for us to be close.
　　The reporter then asked them to talk about their most profound impressions during their visit to China.

　　Mr. Sani and Mr. Chander also enthusiastically talked about their unforgettable impressions when they met Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou. Mr. Chander said:
　　"When I shook hands with Chairman Mao, I saw that his hands were the hands of an architect. He is the architect of your country, and he is also a great figure in Asia and the world. I want to bring back the great friendship of these six hundred million people." Kapoor said, I will also always remember the moment I was with your Premier Zhou Enlai. He told us something beautiful. He said that strength comes from the people. I immediately understood what he meant. It is the strong love for the country and the people that gives the leaders strength.

　　外国朋友谈他们访问我国的观感
　  印度电影代表团
    印度电影代表团离开广州回国的时候，曾对广州市的新闻记者畅谈了在中国访问的观感。
    当他们谈到对中国各大城市举行印度电影周活动的印象时，团长卡普尔说，我们非常感谢中国政府和中国人民对我们的友谊。
    印度名作家和电影编剧家钱德尔说，中国观众对印度影片的热烈喝采，这是六亿人民对四亿人民的友好表现，他希望这样的友好聚会能够永远持久。
    谈到今后如何加强中印两国之间的文化交流时，卡普尔说，你们伟大的领袖和总理说过，中、印两国之间既然有很多共同之处，因此我们的接近是很自然的事。
    记者接着请他们谈谈在中国访问的时候比较深刻的印象。
    卡普尔说，我一踏进这个伟大国家的时候，给我印象最深的那伟大的时刻就是当我见到伟大的毛主席。
    萨尼和钱德尔先生也热烈谈述他们同毛主席、周总理会见的时候的难忘的印象。钱德尔先生说：
  “当我和毛主席握手时，我看见他的手是建筑家的手，他是你们国家的建筑家，同时他还是亚洲的和世界的伟大人物，我要把这六亿人民的伟大友谊带回去。”卡普尔说，我也永远记住和你们的总理周恩来先生在一起的时刻。他向我们说了一件美好的事情。他说，力量来自人民。我立刻懂得了他的意思。正是对国家和人民的强烈的爱，才使领袖有了力量。
　  印度尼西亚——中国友好协会代表团团员
  最近应邀访问了中国的印度尼西亚—中国友好协会代表团团员们对人民中国所取得的进展留下了深刻的印象。据雅加达“新报”十一月四日报道，代表团团长纳苏申在对新闻记者发表谈话时说，他这次访问中国已经是第二次了，他特别注意到中国执行新的婚姻法的情况。许多妇女都参加建设工作，因为她们希望对建设国家贡献一分力量。在工作中，男女有同等的权利和义务。
    据雅加达“生活报”三日报道，代表团副团长英德罗苏贡多说，新中国的文化、艺术和科学同国家建设密切联系，作家和其他文化工作者的生活得到充分的保证。他说，宗教自由在中国得到保证，少数民族不会受到任何歧视。
    代表团团员、马斯友美党三宝垄地方组织的领导者苏坦·巴图阿在回到三宝垄后十月二十七日在一次集会上说，中国有宗教自由，伊斯兰教正在没有任何束缚地发展。他说，当他在北京的时候，他曾经同中国伊斯兰教徒们一起参加聚礼。他还会见了一些已经了解可兰经的十多岁的少年。
