    The Chinese edition of the World Information Bureau's newspaper "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" No. 42, 1955, has been published.

    This issue contains the Communiqué on the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Resolution of the Plenary Session on Convening the Eighth National Congress of the Party, and an abstract of Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the question of agricultural cooperation. This issue also published an editorial entitled "Major Events in the Life of the Communist Party of China." The editorial pointed out that the resolution passed by the Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee opened up a new historical stage for China's cause of building a socialist society and has great international significance. The Chinese people have already made remarkable achievements in all economic and cultural sectors in the implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. The great socialist transformation movement being carried out among the rural population in China has been rising day by day. As the plenary session pointed out, the high tide of socialist reform of cooperation in the rural areas of the People's Republic of China is about to arrive. Practical life shows that the majority of peasants are determined to take the socialist road, and the cooperative movement in rural China will soon become popular throughout the country. The editorial emphasized that the Communist Party of China has full confidence in the masses, resolutely overcomes all obstacles and difficulties, and unswervingly leads China towards socialism. The achievements of the Chinese people strongly inspire the working people of all countries, who regard the People's China as a powerful force for consolidating peace and international friendship.

    Important articles in this issue include: "The Experience of Geneva and Canada" by Tim Buck, General Secretary of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada; "On the Communist Party" by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; "A Sense of Novelty is an Important Quality of Party Workers" by Koldělka, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; and "On the Eve of the Swiss Parliamentary Elections" by Baudemann, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Swiss Labor Party.

    Buck's article is an excerpt from his report at the National Committee meeting of the Labor Progressive Party of Canada this year. Buck pointed out that the Geneva Summit Conference of the Four Powers opened a new stage in post-war politics. At the same time, the achievements of the Geneva Conference opened up broad prospects for Canadians and a new stage in the struggle for stable post-war prosperity and national development. Some important measures taken recently by the Canadian government to strengthen relations with the Soviet Union reflect current changes. A broad political struggle must be launched to enable Canada to implement a truly independent and autonomous policy. Buck also said that the Geneva Conference has created new conditions for peaceful coexistence. In order to adapt to this situation, Canadian democrats must resolutely demand a change in the economic policy based on war and inflation and implement an economic policy aimed at peaceful prosperity.

    布克的文章是他今年在加拿大劳工进步党全国委员会会议上的报告摘要。布克指出：日内瓦四大国政府首脑会议开辟了战后政治上的新阶段。同时，日内瓦会议的成就为加拿大人开辟了远大的前景，开辟了争取稳定战后繁荣、争取国家发展的斗争的新阶段。加拿大政府最近采取的一些加强对苏联的关系的重要措施，反映了目前的变化。必须展开广泛的政治斗争，使加拿大实行真正独立自主的政策。布克又说，日内瓦会议为和平共处创造了新的条件，为了很好地适应这种情况，目前加拿大的民主人士必须坚决地要求改变以战争和通货膨胀为基础的经济政策，而实行以和平繁荣为目的的经济政策。
