    Widely Utilize Sugar Beet Pulp as Livestock Feed
    To the Editor:
    In order to save grain for the country, I suggest a wider use of sugar beet pulp as a mixed feed for livestock. In the process of sugar production from sugar beets, after the sugar content is extracted, more than 80% of the sugar beet pulp (sugar beet residue) remains. One hundred kilograms of sugar beet pulp can be pressed into six kilograms of dried pulp. The dried pulp contains: 12% moisture, 9.8% crude protein, 1.1% crude fat, 48.7% soluble carbohydrates, 24.3% crude fiber, and 4.1% crude ash. It has a certain nutritional value and is no worse as a mixed feed for livestock than by-products of ordinary grains. The Jilin Provincial Food Factory's farm uses sugar beet pulp as a mixed feed for dairy cows, and the effect is very good. When the farm lacks this feed, the milk production of the dairy cows will decrease by more than 11%.
    However, as far as I know, among the six sugar beet factories in Northeast China, only the Jilin Provincial Sugar Factory and the Harbin Sugar Factory have some production equipment for manufacturing dried sugar beet pulp. Other sugar factories either dump the sugar beet pulp into rivers, letting it flow away with the water, or leave it on the ground to rot. Take our Jilin Provincial Sugar Factory, for example. With the existing equipment, we can only produce 30 to 40 tons of dried sugar beet pulp per day, which can only process about 70% to 80% of our factory's total sugar beet pulp. Due to the limited production capacity of dried sugar beet pulp, the current product supply is far from meeting demand.
    The machinery and equipment for pressing sugar beet pulp into dried pulp are not technically complex. Setting up such a workshop in a sugar beet factory requires less investment than the entire sugar production equipment, but the benefits to the country are significant. I suggest that sugar beet factories in various regions and relevant higher-level leading departments pay attention to this work.

### 广泛地利用甜菜粕作牲畜饲料

    广泛地利用甜菜粕作牲畜饲料编辑同志：
    为了给国家节约粮食，我建议更加广泛地利用甜菜粕作为牲畜的混合饲料。甜菜在制糖的过程中，所含的糖的成分浸出来以后，还剩下百分之八十以上的甜菜粕（甜菜渣子）。每一百公斤甜菜粕可以压出六公斤干粕。干粕中含有：水分百分之十二，粗蛋白质百分之九点八，粗油脂百分之一点一，可溶性炭水化合物百分之四十八点七，粗纤维素百分之二十四点三，粗灰分百分之四点一。它具有一定的营养价值，作为牲畜的混合饲料并不比一般谷物的副产品差。吉林省食品工厂的牧场采用甜菜粕作为奶牛的混合饲料，效果就很好。当牧场缺乏这种饲料时，奶牛的产奶量便要降低百分之十一强。
    可是，据我所知，东北六个甜菜制糖厂，除吉林省制糖厂和哈尔滨糖厂有一部分制造干甜菜粕的生产设备外，别的糖厂，有的是把甜菜粕倒到江河里去，让它顺水流走；有的放在地里让它烂掉。就拿我们吉林省制糖厂已有设备来说，每天只能生产干甜菜粕三十吨到四十吨，只能处理我厂全部甜菜粕的百分之七十到八十左右。由于干甜菜粕的生产能力有限，目前产品供不应求的情况很严重。
    把甜菜粕压制成干粕的机器设备，在技术上并不复杂；在甜菜制糖厂中附设这样一个车间，比起整个制糖设备来说，投资额并不多，但是对国家的收益却很大。我建议各地的甜菜制糖厂和各有关的上级领导部门重视这个工作。　吉林省制糖厂　贺乃光
