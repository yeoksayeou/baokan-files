Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- The meeting of bureau chiefs of the Ministry of Geology, which closed today, determined the geological survey tasks for the Ministry of Geology system in 1956.

The total scale of geological exploration determined by the meeting for next year exceeds the total of the past three years. The total depth of core drilling will increase by 194% compared to the estimated completion in 1955, exceeding the total of the past three years by 49.4%. Pit exploration exceeds 1955 by 87%, equivalent to 99.3% of the total work volume of the previous three years. Trench exploration will increase by 180% compared to 1955, exceeding the total trench exploration work volume of the previous three years by 14.7%. All indicators of geological exploration greatly exceed the level stipulated for 1956 in the First Five-Year Plan.

The meeting believes that completing the geological survey tasks in 1956 is of great significance for ensuring the completion of the First Five-Year Plan and preparing for the Second Five-Year Plan. In 1956, the Ministry of Geology will organize mineral exploration teams and prospecting teams equivalent to twice the number this year. In terms of ferrous metal mineral resources, they will conduct exploration of ferrous metal mineral resources in more areas to discover more iron ore to meet the needs of establishing new iron and steel bases nationwide, especially in the southwest and northwest regions; at the same time, they must find more new producing areas of manganese and rich iron ore for steelmaking. They will also conduct exploration of non-ferrous metal mineral resources in hundreds of areas. In addition to continuing to identify more reserves of copper, lead, tin, etc., the main task is to find new reserve producing areas for exploration. In 1956, in addition to expanding the scope of the original petroleum prospecting areas and opening up new prospecting areas, regular prospecting surveys will be carried out in areas that have already undergone prospecting and reconnaissance and have hopes for exploration. Detailed surveys or fine measurements will be carried out on oil-bearing structures selected in the survey area, in order to provide reserve areas for drilling. In addition, more producing areas of oil shale coal and oil shale and other raw materials for artificial petroleum must be found, and the necessary reserves must be provided. In 1956, new coal producing areas will be vigorously explored. And minerals such as phosphorus and sulfur will be explored in more than 40 regions.

The meeting pointed out that although the geological survey tasks in 1956 are very heavy, all indicators are based on a reliable foundation. As long as all favorable factors are brought into full play and potential capabilities are further tapped, there are conditions to complete the geological survey tasks in 1956. In order to ensure the victorious completion of next year's tasks, the meeting decided to further strengthen prospecting inspection work and regional geological survey work, enhance the technical strength and technical equipment of the prospecting teams, give full play to the enthusiasm of local prospecting teams, and systematically organize mass ore reporting work. In terms of management, exploration teams are required to gradually move towards standardization, implement economic accounting systems, establish design and budget systems, as well as responsibility systems for various tasks, promote quota management, and strengthen technical management. In terms of scientific research work, it is necessary to strengthen organizational leadership, improve scientific and technical levels, further study advanced Soviet experience, establish comprehensive and specialized scientific research institutions in phases, and promote new scientific and technical methods.

This meeting began on October 28. In addition to the directors of geological bureaus under the Ministry of Geology, relevant departments of the central government also sent people to participate. The meeting also invited Soviet experts to give relevant reports.

Xinhua News Agency, 12th -- This reporter learned today from the Ministry of Geology that Chinese geological prospecting personnel have found three promising large-scale iron ore deposits this year in the northwest region, which previously lacked iron ore producing areas. According to preliminary data, the iron ore resources in these mining areas are abundant and may meet the needs of building an iron and steel base.

One of these three iron ore deposits is in Gansu Province. Its reserves may be very large, the iron content of the ore meets the requirements for iron smelting, and it also has good transportation conditions. Another iron ore deposit is on the border between Qinghai and Tibet. According to preliminary investigation, geological personnel believe that this is a promising large mining area. According to reports from geological personnel, the iron ore discovered in Qinghai Province is also a promising mining area.

This year, the Ministry of Geology sent more geological personnel to the Northwest region to search for iron ore than in any previous year. Geological personnel worked in the deep mountains and dense forests where few people had ever been, with the assistance of the local people. The discovery of these important iron ore resources is the result of the hard work of the vast number of geological personnel with the enthusiastic support of the local people.

### 明年地质勘察工作规模巨大　西北地区今年发现丰富的铁矿资源

　　明年地质勘察工作规模巨大
　　西北地区今年发现丰富的铁矿资源
    据新华社十二日讯　今天闭幕的地质部局长会议确定了地质部系统一九五六年的地质勘察任务。
    会议确定的明年地质勘察总规模超过了过去三年的总和。岩心钻探的总深度将比一九五五年预计完成数增加百分之一百九十四，超过过去三年总和百分之四十九点四。坑探超过一九五五年百分之八十七，相当于前三年工作总量的百分之九十九点三。槽探比一九五五年增加百分之一百八十，超过前三年槽探工作总量百分之十四点七。地质勘察的各项指标都大大超过了第一个五年计划规定的一九五六年的水平。
    会议认为，完成一九五六年的地质勘察任务对保证完成第一个五年计划和为第二个五年计划作好准备，具有重大的意义。一九五六年，地质部将组织相当于今年两倍的矿产勘探队和普查队。在黑色金属矿产方面，他们将在更多的地区进行黑色金属矿产的勘察，以便勘察出更多的铁矿来满足全国特别是西南、西北等地区建立新钢铁基地的需要；同时要找到更多的锰和炼钢用的富铁矿的新产地。他们还将在数百个地区进行有色金属矿产的勘察，除了继续探明更多的铜、铅、锡等的储量外，主要是要找到新的可供勘探的后备产地。一九五六年除了扩大原有石油普查地区的范围和开辟新的普查地区外，在已经进行过普查和踏勘并有勘探希望的地区，将进行正规的普查测量，并在测区选择良好的储油构造进行详查或细测，以便提供钻探后备地区。此外，还要找到更多的炼油煤和油母页岩等人造石油原料的产地，并提供出必要的储量。一九五六年将大力勘察新的煤炭产地。并将在四十多个地区勘察磷和硫等矿产。
    会议指出，一九五六年的地质勘察任务虽然十分繁重，但各项指标是建立在可靠基础上的。只要充分发挥各种有利因素，进一步挖掘潜在能力，是有条件完成一九五六年的地质勘察任务的。为了保证胜利地完成明年的任务，会议决定进一步加强普查检查工作和区域地质调查工作，增强普查队的技术力量和技术装备，同时充分发挥地方普查队伍的积极性，并系统地组织群众报矿工作。在管理方面，要求勘探队逐步走向正规化，贯彻实行经济核算制度，建立设计和预算制度，以及各种工作的责任制度，推行定额管理，加强技术管理等工作。在科学研究工作方面，要加强组织领导，提高科学技术水平，进一步学习苏联先进经验，要分期地建立综合性的和各项专业性的科学研究机构，推行新的科学技术方法。
    这次会议是在十月二十八日开始举行的，出席会议的除了地质部所属各地质局局长外，中央各有关部门也都派人参加。会议还邀请苏联专家作了有关的报告。
    新华社十二日讯　本社记者今天从地质部获悉：中国地质普查人员今年已在过去缺少铁矿产地的西北地区找到了三个有希望的大型的铁矿。根据初步资料，这些矿区的铁矿资源的储量丰富，可能满足建设一个钢铁基地的需要。
    这三个铁矿中有一个在甘肃省，它的储量可能很大、矿石含铁成分合乎炼铁要求，同时有着很好的交通条件。另一个铁矿在青海和西藏地区的边界。据初步调查，地质人员认为这是一个有希望的大矿区。据地质人员报告，在青海省境内发现的铁矿，也是一个有希望的矿区。
    今年，地质部派往西北地区寻找铁矿的地质人员比过去任何一年都多。地质人员在当地人民的协助下，在许多人迹罕到的深山密林中进行了工作。这些重要的铁矿资源的发现，就是广大地质人员在当地人民热情支援下艰苦工作的结果。
