    Feng Ruiju Cultivates Improved Rice Variety
    Feng Ruiju, an agricultural science worker at the Xiong Yue Agricultural Experiment Station in Liaoning Province, has cultivated a new rice variety called "Weiguo" rice, suitable for the rice-growing areas of southern Liaoning. "Weiguo" rice is disease-resistant, fertilizer-tolerant, has robust stalks that are not easily lodged, large ears with abundant grains, tightly packed grains, and matures relatively early, resulting in higher yields. According to three years of continuous planting on eight farms in Liaoning, the average yield per hectare reached 12,088 jin, 15.9 percent higher than the yield of the locally superior "Luyu No. 132" rice variety. Among them, the trial planting at Benxi Farm resulted in a maximum yield of 16,590 jin per hectare. This year, farmers in nine counties in southern Liaoning also conducted trial plantings, with yields exceeding 10,000 jin per hectare. The current rice yield in these counties is only around 6,000 to 8,000 jin. Southern Liaoning, crisscrossed by rivers, is a rice-producing area of the province. If the "Weiguo" improved rice variety is widely adopted, it is estimated that rice production could increase by at least 180 million jin. "Weiguo" rice was first tested in 1953. In 1955, the Ministry of Agriculture considered the trial results to be good and decided to further promote it in Gaiping, Yingkou, and Xiuyan counties, and organized farmers in Dalian and other places to conduct trial plantings. This autumn harvest, the farmers unanimously reported good results. To reward Feng Ruiju's contribution to agricultural production increase, the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee awarded him the title of First-Class Agricultural Production Increase Model, and also presented him with a certificate and prizes.

    冯瑞聚培育了水稻良种
    辽宁省熊岳农业试验站农业科学工作者冯瑞聚，培育出一种新的适应于辽宁南部水稻种植区的品种“卫国”水稻。“卫国”水稻抗病耐肥，植株健壮不易倒伏，穗大粒多，着粒紧密，成熟期较早，因而产量较高。据辽宁八个农场连种三年结果，平均每垧产量达一万二千零八十八斤，比用当地较好的“陆羽一三二号”稻种的产量高百分之十五点九，其中本溪农场试种结果，每垧最高产量达一万六千五百九十斤。今年辽宁南部九个县农民也进行试种，每垧产量都达到一万多斤，这些县现有水稻的产量，只在六千斤到八千斤左右。辽南地区河流纵横，是全省水稻产区，如果普遍采用“卫国”优良稻种，据最低估计可增产一亿八千万斤水稻。“卫国”水稻是于一九五三年开始试种的，一九五五年农业部认为试种结果良好，决定进一步在盖平、营口、岫岩三县推广，并组织旅大等地农民试种，今年秋收农民一致反映良好。为了奖励冯瑞聚对农业增产的贡献，辽宁省人民委员会除授予他一等农业增产模范称号外，并发给他奖状和奖品。
