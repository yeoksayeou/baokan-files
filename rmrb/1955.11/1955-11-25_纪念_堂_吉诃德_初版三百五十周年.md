　　Commemorating the 350th Anniversary of the First Edition of "Don Quixote"

    It has been 350 years since the first part of "Don Quixote," the famous novel by the great Spanish writer Cervantes, was published. Over the centuries, the names of many Spanish emperors and generals have been forgotten, but this novel, which seemed insignificant more than 300 years ago, is still alive and increasingly vibrant, increasingly loved by the people of Spain and the world. Generations of Spanish people have continuously drawn ideological and emotional resonance and spiritual support from the novel. They regard it as their life textbook, drawing infinite wisdom from it, accepting lofty humanistic ideas, and learning the spirit of resisting slavery and oppression and striving for freedom and justice. Long before the first part of the novel was published, "Don Quixote" went beyond the borders of its own country and began to spread abroad. Since the 18th century, it has been recognized as Spain's great contribution to human culture.
      Cervantes, the author of "Don Quixote," lived in a turbulent and rapidly changing era. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Spanish Empire, which possessed vast colonial resources overseas, suffered losses in years of foreign plundering wars, the national treasury was depleted, agriculture and industry and commerce declined, and its international status declined. In order to maintain their ruling position and extravagant lives, the ruling class intensified its oppression of the people at home. The Spanish people could not bear the autocratic oppression and extortionate taxes and rose up to resist. The feudal regime further carried out bloody suppression of the people, which aroused greater public resentment and further shook the foundation of feudal rule. Cervantes not only witnessed and participated in these turbulent events, but also suffered the unfortunate fate along with the people of his motherland. He spent his life in continuous suffering, misfortune, and poverty.
    Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra was born in 1547 in the city of Alcalá de Henares, Spain. His father was a poor doctor. He wandered with his father from an early age and later served as a soldier in the Spanish army stationed in Italy; he participated in the war between Spain and Turkey and was seriously injured in the Battle of Lepanto; he was captured by the Turks on his way back to his country and spent five years of humiliating captivity in Algeria; after returning to his country, he worked as a paymaster in the navy and a tax collector in the inland areas in order to make a living; he was persecuted by government officials and police and was imprisoned twice because he was falsely accused. He wrote many literary works in his life and died on April 23, 1616.
    Due to his unfortunate experiences, Cervantes established a close relationship with the Spanish people. He lived among the people from an early age, sharing their joys and sorrows and being educated by them. Decades of wandering gave Cervantes the opportunity to delve into the lowest levels of society to gain rich life experience, understand the difficult lives of the people under the autocratic oppression of the exploiting classes and their urgent demands, and discover their rich wisdom and potential.
    In "Don Quixote," Cervantes used extraordinary artistic skills to unfold a vast and true picture of Spanish social life in the 16th and 17th centuries. The novel's breadth and scope in terms of the number of characters, regions, and events it encompasses is rare in world literature. The novel profoundly exposes the corruption and collapse of the feudal system and the increasing power of capitalist monetary relations, and truly reflects the inhuman lives of the Spanish people in this turbulent era and their noble spirit of loving justice and freedom and resisting slavery and oppression. The author relentlessly satirizes and exposes the ugly side of feudal aristocrats and Catholic Spain, while placing great sympathy and hope on the hardworking, intelligent, and brave people in suffering. Therefore, Gorky later very justly included "Don Quixote" in the list of those few great works of the world "that astonishingly condense the world's thoughts, feelings, blood, bitter water, and tears in image and language and appear before us."
    Don Quixote is a very complex and contradictory character in Cervantes' pen. He worships the "heroic" age of chivalry in the past to the point of losing his mind, living madly in a fantasy world far removed from reality. In his eyes, the surrounding world has become a world of demons and monsters, and he imagines himself as a knight shouldering the great task of eliminating violence, helping the weak, and supporting the poor. But his fantasy world is too far from the real world, so he always messes things up and creates endless jokes. He embraces enthusiasm and rights wrongs for others, but often not only does no good to others, but harms them, and even gets himself beaten black and blue. Cervantes made a merciless satire and criticism of his protagonist's thought that was divorced from reality and his behavior of struggling in vain without regard to realistic historical conditions.
    But as readers read on page after page, they will gradually feel that the author's sharp and ruthless ridicule actually contains tears of infinite sadness and sympathy; behind the protagonist's absurd and ridiculous fantasy lies a very cruel and terrible reality; and Don Quixote's thoughts and actions, in addition to the humorous and ridiculous side, mainly have a respectable and lovable, sublime side.
    The novel unfolds a world where social evils are rampant, the ruling class is extravagant and corrupt, justice is not upheld, freedom is suppressed, and the masses of the people suffer. The police, the Holy Brotherhood, the priests, the extravagant and profligate aristocrats and their lackeys, etc., are of course representatives of the evil forces in the real world; aren't those enemies, demons, giants, bullies, etc., transformed from windmills, sheep flocks, wine bladders, etc., that Don Quixote sees in his fantasy also incarnations of the evil forces in the real world? In Cervantes' time, Western European entrepreneurs set up many mills to exploit farmers, and wealthy nobles enclosed farmers' cultivated land as pastures. Windmills and sheep flocks were associated with the concept of social evil forces in the minds of the people.
    Don Quixote, on the one hand, is a caricature of the knights in chivalric novels made by the author, but on the other hand, he is very different from these knights. He is not a noble knight who is loyal to the feudal aristocracy. On the contrary, he is the deadly enemy of the feudal ruling class. He is a poor knight who is incompatible with the lackeys of the feudal aristocrats and the domineering aristocratic knights. He hates the reality full of demons and is irreconcilable with the evil forces; at the same time, he loves freedom and justice, sympathizes with the oppressed, and stands with the suffering people. Cervantes fully embodied the advanced humanistic spirit of his era in Don Quixote, making him an expression of the Spanish people's rebellious sentiments under feudal oppression.
    Don Quixote, as Belinsky said, "is first of all an excellent and noble person, a fearless and impeccable true knight. No matter how ridiculous he is from head to toe, inside and out - he is not stupid, but on the contrary very smart; he is simply a truly wise and brave figure." He has far-reaching ideals. He longs to restore that free, democratic, and peaceful "Golden Age" on the earth. In that era, as he himself said, "People do not know the words 'yours' and 'mine'," "everything is public," and "there is an atmosphere of friendship, peace, and harmony everywhere" (Part 1, Chapter 11).
    Don Quixote is immortal not only because he has these lofty ideals, but also because he is not a dreamer, but a brave warrior. He has unwavering faith in his ideals and the determination to fight bravely for them to the end. He never considers his personal gains and losses. In order to achieve his ideals, he can endure any test, putting his life aside. Moreover, he is full of a high degree of optimism, not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of setbacks, and perseveres in the struggle to the end. Belinsky was right, "If this heroic spirit, this chivalry, this loyalty, if all these beautiful, sublime, and noble qualities are used appropriately and in a timely manner - Don Quixote is a truly great figure!"
    Why does Don Quixote, who has such lofty ideals and noble qualities, appear in Cervantes' novel as a person who has lost his mind? This also has its certain social roots. There are many such examples in literature. For example, Hamlet had to feign madness to avenge his father; in Griboyedov's play "Woe from Wit," the protagonist Chatsky was declared a madman in public because he fiercely condemned the stupidity, mediocrity, and cruelty of Russian high society; and in our classical literature, isn't there also a figure like Jia Baoyu who was accused of being insane because he expressed rebellious ideas? In the cannibalistic old society, if one wanted to express resistance, one often had to feign madness or be regarded as a madman. Don Quixote, who lost his mind, was fighting for a high degree of reason. He was a warrior against the social system that took unreason as the highest law. And Cervantes cleverly used the characteristic of the novel's protagonist losing his mind to express his ideals.
    In addition to Don Quixote, Cervantes also brilliantly created another extremely successful image, that is, the loyal friend and companion of the Knight of La Mancha, his squire Sancho Panza. The author truly embodies the high wisdom and beautiful qualities of the common people in this character. Sancho is a poor farmer who has lost his land. Dissatisfied with real life, he is willing to abandon his wife and children and leave his hometown to follow Don Quixote on adventures in pursuit of beautiful ideals. At first, he was always attracted by the prospect of being the governor of an island. Later, he established a deep friendship with his master, and his life experience became richer. His desire gradually faded. He slowly adopted a realistic attitude towards life and gradually overcame his personal desires and class limitations, and his noble qualities became more and more apparent. In the second part of the novel, Cervantes boldly made this Castilian farmer the governor of the fictional Barataria Island. He vividly showed how much talent an ordinary person can display when he breaks free from the constraints of social conditions. As governor, Sancho performed his duties excellently. His wise decision-making and selfless style were a sharp satire of the stupid, incompetent, and people-eating bureaucratic government of Spain at that time.
      "Don Quixote" is a work full of such great humanistic spiritual power, so it is naturally hated by the reactionary forces of the world. Long before the first part of "Don Quixote" was published, a rogue writer named Avellaneda appeared in Spain. He wrote a fake second part of "Don Quixote" from a reactionary Catholic point of view to attack Cervantes. Today, Franco's Spain and his master American imperialism have even deeper hatred for Cervantes and his "Don Quixote." They either frantically attacked, saying that Cervantes was a pioneer of the "Russian Bolsheviks," and therefore clamored to "drive Don Quixote out." Even the old building of the printing house that printed and published the first part of "Don Quixote" in 1605 was recently demolished by the Francoists and rebuilt into a casino. Or they viciously slandered,抹杀消掉 the social significance of "Don Quixote," saying that it was "the most boring book in the world," and described the author as a so-called politically neutral artist or simply "a devout and enthusiastic Catholic," and so on. Otherwise, they put on disguises, expressed "admiration" for Cervantes, and shamelessly painted him into their own image. For example, last summer, the Francoists set up a so-called "Cervantes Prize" to use the name of this talented writer to stimulate their reactionary fascist literature. The most ridiculous thing is that the notorious American spy chief J. Edgar Hoover actually "has deep respect and sympathy for 'Don Quixote'," and he believes that the protagonist of the novel, due to his "spirit of not being afraid of going through fire and water," should become a model for Americans, who he describes as "pioneers of the atomic age."
    But can the great "Don Quixote," which has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of the people for more than 300 years, be arbitrarily erased and distorted by the reactionaries? The reason why they persecute this great work so much is simply that they feel extremely terrified by its far-reaching influence among the people of the world. Their slander is in vain. This year, the people of all countries in the world are enthusiastically responding to the call of the World Peace Council to universally hold the commemoration of the 350th anniversary of the first edition of "Don Quixote," which shows that this immortal work has not lost its brilliance in the slightest. On the contrary, it is more brilliant than before. In our era, it has become a powerful force for uniting progressive mankind around the world and helping them fight against the dark forces of violence, slavery, and war!

　　纪念“堂·吉诃德”初版三百五十周年

    西班牙伟大作家塞万提斯的著名的长篇小说
  “堂·吉诃德”第一部出版至今已经三百五十年了。几世纪来，西班牙许多帝王将相的名字已经为人遗忘，但是在三百多年前看来似乎微不足道的这部小说却至今活着，而且越来越富有生命力，越来越为西班牙和全世界的人民所热爱。世世代代的西班牙人民不断地从小说里得到思想感情上的共鸣和精神上的支持。他们把它当作自己的生活教科书，从里面汲取无穷的智慧，接受崇高的人道主义思想，学习反抗奴役压迫和争取自由正义的精神。远在小说第一部出版之后不久，“堂·吉诃德”就越出自己祖国的范围，开始流传到国外去，从十八世纪起，它就被公认为西班牙人民对于人类文化的伟大贡献。
      “堂·吉诃德”的作者塞万提斯生活在一个动荡和激变的时代。在十六—十七世纪这个时期，在海外拥有广大殖民地富源的西班牙帝国，由于连年对外进行掠夺战争失利，国库枯竭，农业和工商业衰败，国际地位低落。为了维持自己的统治地位和荒淫生活，统治阶级对国内人民加紧压榨。西班牙人民不堪忍受专制压迫和横征暴敛，纷纷起义反抗。封建政权又进一步对人民施行血腥的镇压，因此激起了更大的民愤，同时也更动摇了封建统治的根基。塞万提斯不但目击和参与了这些动乱事变，而且和他祖国的人民一起遭受了不幸的命运，他的一生是在连绵不断的苦难不幸、贫困潦倒之中度过的。
    米盖尔·德·塞万提斯·萨维德拉于一五四七年生在西班牙阿尔卡拉·德·海那列斯城。父亲是一个穷医生。他从小随着父亲流浪，后来在西班牙驻意大利的军队里当过兵；参加过西班牙和土耳其的战争，在里班陀一役中身受重伤；返国途中被土耳其人俘掳，在阿尔及利亚度过五年屈辱的俘虏生活；回国后为了生活，做过海军里的军需官和内地的收税员；受过政府官吏和警察的迫害，因被人诬告而坐过两次牢。他一生中写过不少文学作品，于一六一六年四月二十三日逝世。
    由于不幸的遭遇，塞万提斯同西班牙人民建立了血肉相连的密切关系。他从小就在人民群众中间生活，和他们同呼吸，共甘苦，并且受到他们的教育。几十年的流浪生活使塞万提斯有机会深入到社会的最下层去获取丰富的生活经验，了解人民群众在剥削阶级专制压迫下的困苦生活和他们的迫切的要求，并且发现他们的丰富的智慧和潜力。
    在“堂·吉诃德”里，塞万提斯以非凡的艺术手腕展开了一幅广大而真实的十六—十七世纪西班牙社会生活的图画。小说所包罗的人物、地区和事件的数量之多和范围之广，在世界文学中是不多见的。小说深刻地暴露了封建制度腐化、崩溃和资本主义金钱关系日益得势的过程，并且真实地反映了西班牙人民在这个动乱时代所过的非人生活以及他们酷爱正义自由反抗奴役压迫的高贵精神。作者无情地讽刺和揭发了封建贵族和天主教的西班牙的丑恶的一面，而以十分的同情和希望寄托在苦难中的勤劳智慧英勇的人民的身上。所以后来高尔基非常公正地把“堂·吉诃德”列入了那些“在形象和语言中惊人地凝结了世界上的思想、感情、鲜血、苦水、热泪而在我们面前出现的”少数世界伟大作品之列。
    堂·吉诃德在塞万提斯的笔下是一个非常复杂和矛盾的人物。他崇拜过去“英雄的”骑士时代，以至于失去理智，疯疯癫癫地生活在一个远离现实的幻想世界里。在他的眼睛里，周围的世界成了一个妖魔鬼怪横行的世界，他把自己也想像成了一个负着锄暴安良、济弱扶倾的大任的骑士。但是他的幻想世界同现实世界距离实在太远，因此总是弄巧成拙，造成无穷笑料。他抱着满腔热忱，替别人打抱不平，结果却常常不但对别人没有好处，反而害了别人，甚至连自己也被打得头破血流。塞万提斯对于他的主人公这种脱离现实的思想和不顾现实历史条件而徒劳无益地斗争的行为作了毫不容情的讽刺和批判。
    但是当读者一页一页地读下去的时候，都会渐渐感觉到，在作者泼辣无情的嘲笑里实际上却包含着无限辛酸同情的热泪；在主人公的荒唐可笑的幻想后面却隐藏着非常残酷可怕的现实；而堂·吉诃德的思想行为，除了滑稽可笑的一面之外，却主要的还有着可敬可爱的崇高的一面。
    小说里展开的是一个社会恶势力当道、统治阶级荒淫腐化、正义不张、自由被压抑、人民大众受苦遭难的世界。警察、神圣保卫团、神父、骄侈淫逸的贵族和他们的奴才等等，固然是现实世界里的恶势力的代表；就是堂·吉诃德在幻想中所看到的那些由磨坊风车、羊群、酒囊等等变成的敌人、妖魔、巨人、恶霸等等，难道不也是现实世界里的恶势力的化身吗？在塞万提斯的时代，西欧的企业主设立了许多磨坊来盘剥农民，豪门贵族把农民的耕地圈作牧场，磨坊风车和羊群在人民的意识里正是和社会恶势力的概念相联结在一起的。
    堂·吉诃德这个人物，一方面是作者对骑士小说里的骑士所作的漫画像，但是另一方面他又和这些骑士大不相同，他不是一个效忠于封建贵族的贵族骑士，恰恰相反，他是封建统治阶级的死对头，他是同封建贵族的走狗、横行霸道的贵族骑士誓不两立的穷骑士。他痛恨魔障重重的现实，和恶势力不共戴天；同时他酷爱自由正义，同情被压迫者，和苦难的人民站在一起。塞万提斯在堂·吉诃德身上充分体现了他那个时代的先进的人道主义精神，使他成了封建制度压迫下西班牙人民的反抗情绪的表现者。
    堂·吉诃德，正如别林斯基所说，“首先是一个极优秀、极高贵的人，是一个无所畏惧、无可非议的真正骑士。不管他从头到脚、里里外外都如何可笑，——他不但不愚蠢，而且相反地很聪明；简直是一个真正大智大勇的人物。”他有着远大的理想。他渴望在大地上恢复那一个自由、民主、和平的“黄金时代”。在那个时代，象他自己所说的，
  “人们不知道你的和我的这两个词儿”，“一切都是公共的”，“到处一片友好、和平和融洽的空气”（第一部第十一章）。
    堂·吉诃德之所以成为不朽，不仅仅由于他有着这些崇高的理想，而且还由于他不是一个空想家，而是一个英勇的战士。他对自己的理想有着坚定不移的信念，而且有着为了它英勇奋斗到底的决心。他从来不考虑自己个人的利害得失。为了达到他的理想，他可以忍受任何的考验，生命都置之度外。而且他充满着高度的乐观主义精神，不怕困难，不怕挫折，坚持斗争到底。别林斯基说的对，
  “如果这种英勇精神、这种豪侠气概、这种忠诚，如果所有这些优美、崇高、高贵的品质运用得恰当，及时，——堂·吉诃德就是一个真正伟大的人物！”
    有着这样崇高理想和高贵品质的堂·吉诃德，为什么在塞万提斯的小说里要以一个失去了理智的人物的姿态出现呢？这也是有着它一定的社会根源的。文学上不乏这样的例子，譬如说，哈姆雷特为了报仇不得不装疯；在格里波耶陀夫的剧本“智慧的苦恼”里，主人公恰茨基由于他猛烈谴责俄国上流社会的愚蠢、庸碌、残酷而被当众宣布为疯子；而在我国古典文学里，不是也有贾宝玉这样的人物由于他表现了叛逆思想而被指责为疯癫吗？在吃人的旧社会里，如果要表示反抗，常常不是不得已而装疯，就是被目为疯子。失去了理智的堂·吉诃德是为了高度的理智而战斗的，他是反对那以不理智为最高法律的社会制度的战士。而塞万提斯却也正是巧妙地通过小说主人公的失去理智这个特点来表现了他的理想。
    除了堂·吉诃德之外，塞万提斯还出色地创造了另外一个极成功的形象，那就是拉·曼却骑士的忠实的朋友和伴侣，他的侍从桑科·判扎。作者在这个人物身上真实地体现了普通人民的高度智慧和优美品质。桑科是一个失去了土地的贫农。他不满现实的生活，为了追求美好的理想，他甘愿抛弃妻儿，远离故乡，跟随堂·吉诃德出去流浪冒险。起初他一直被海岛总督的前程所吸引着，后来他同他的主人建立了深厚的友谊，生活经验也丰富了，他的这种欲望就渐渐淡下去。他慢慢地对生活采取现实的态度，并且慢慢地克服自己的个人私欲和阶级局限性，而越来越显出他的高贵的品质了。在小说的第二部里，塞万提斯大胆地使这个卡斯蒂里亚的农民变成了幻想中的巴拉塔里亚海岛的总督。他形象地表明了，一个普通人民，当他挣脱了社会条件的限制，会表现出多大的才能。在总督任上，桑科出色地执行了他的职务，他的英明果断和大公无私的作风，对于西班牙当时愚蠢无能、鱼肉人民的官僚主义政府衙门，实在是一种尖锐无比的讽刺。
      “堂·吉诃德”是一部充满着这样伟大的人道主义精神力量的作品，所以它很自然地也受到全世界反动势力的痛恨。远在“堂·吉诃德”第一部出版之后不久，西班牙就出现了一个化名阿万里亚尼达的流氓文人，他以反动的天主教观点写了一本冒牌的“堂·吉诃德”第二部，来攻击塞万提斯。到了今天，佛朗哥的西班牙和他的主子美帝国主义对于塞万提斯和他的“堂·吉诃德”仇恨更深。他们或者是猖狂进攻，说什么塞万提斯是“俄国布尔什维克”的先驱者，因此叫嚣要“把堂·吉诃德驱逐出去”。甚至连那家在一六○五年印刷出版“堂·吉诃德”第一部的印刷所的古老建筑也在不久以前被佛朗哥分子拆毁而改建成了一所赌场。他们或者是恶毒地诬蔑中伤，抹杀“堂·吉诃德”的社会意义，说它是“世界上最枯燥无味的一本书”，而且把作者形容成一个所谓在政治上中立的艺术家或者仅仅是“一个虔诚而热情的天主教徒”等等。再不然，他们就披上伪装，对塞万提斯表示“倾倒”，无耻地把他涂抹成他们自己的相貌。例如去年夏天，佛朗哥分子设立了一种所谓“塞万提斯奖金”，想利用这位天才作家的名字来刺激他们的反动的法西斯文学。最可笑的是声名狼藉的美国特务头子艾德加·胡佛，居然也“对‘堂·吉诃德’怀着深深的敬意和同情”起来，他认为小说的主人公由于他的“不怕赴汤蹈火的精神”竟然应该成为被他形容成“原子时代先锋”的美国人的模范了。
    但是三百多年来早已深入人心的伟大的“堂·吉诃德”难道是反动派所能任意抹杀和歪曲的吗？他们之所以要对这部伟大作品这样横加迫害，没有别的，只能说明他们对于它在世界人民中间所起的深远影响感到万分恐惧。他们的污蔑是枉费心机的。今年世界各国人民热烈响应世界和平理事会的号召，普遍举行“堂·吉诃德”初版三百五十周年的纪念，就说明了这部不朽的作品不但丝毫没有失去它的光芒，相反地比以前更是光辉灿烂了。它在我们的时代已经成了一种团结全世界进步人类和帮助他们对暴力、奴役、战争的黑暗势力进行斗争的强大力量了！
