    Xinhua News Agency, Kuibyshev, November 3rd: According to TASS, the construction workers of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station achieved another significant engineering victory at the end of October: they completed the damming of the Volga River, Europe's largest river, ahead of schedule.

    According to the original plan, this project would have taken twenty days to complete. The builders of the hydroelectric station had guaranteed before the project began that they would complete it in eight days, but they ended up completing the task two days ahead of that schedule.

    During the critical moments of October 30th and 31st, the intense labor rhythm of the damming project on the construction site did not stop for a single minute. Fleets of powerful dump trucks continuously transported hundreds of large concrete blocks, each weighing more than 9,800 kilograms, and thousands of cubic meters of stone to the 350-meter-wide gap in the dam. They dumped them into the roaring Volga River until the gap was closed. During the day, hydrologists' helicopters constantly circled overhead, conducting aerial photography.

    Now, in the Zhiguli Mountains, sung in ancient Russian songs, where the reinforced concrete structures of the hydroelectric station stand tall, the turbulent river has calmed. The water level of the Volga River is rising significantly, and the artificial reservoir "Kuibyshev Sea," which will be up to five kilometers wide here, is about to form. The Volga River is flowing along a new artificial channel; ships on the Volga River are already passing through the canal's locks.

    The first generator unit of the Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station will send out its first batch of electricity by the end of this year. When the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opens in February 1956, this hydroelectric station, with a total generating capacity of two million kilowatts, will have three turbines generating electricity.

    苏联古比雪夫水电站建筑者的重大胜利
    完成拦断伏尔加河的工程
    新华社三日讯　据塔斯社古比雪夫讯：世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站的建筑工人，在十月底又获得了一个工程上具有决定意义的胜利：提前把欧洲最大的河流——伏尔加河的河床拦断了。
    根据原定计划，这一工程需要二十天才能完成。水电站的建筑工人在工程开始前曾经提出在八天内完成的保证，但是，结果在两天内就提前完成了这个任务。
    在十月三十日和三十一日两天的重要时刻里，工地上拦河工程紧张的劳动旋律，没有一分钟停顿过。成群的强大的自卸卡车，不断地把几百个每个重九千八百多公斤的大混凝土块和几千立方公尺的石块运到拦河坝宽三百五十公尺的缺口边，把它们倾倒到缺口中怒吼奔流的伏尔加河河水里，一直到把缺口封闭起来。白天，还有水文学家的直升飞机不断地在空中盘旋，进行空中摄影。
    现在，在古老的俄国歌曲所歌唱的日古里山地区，在水电站钢筋混凝土建筑物耸立的地方，汹涌澎湃的河水已经平静了。伏尔加河水面正在显著地上升，即将形成的人工水库“古比雪夫海”在这里将宽达五公里。伏尔加河水正顺着新的人工河道流去；伏尔加河上的航船已经通过运河的闸门行驶。
    古比雪夫水电站的第一个联动机将在今年年底发出第一批电力。当一九五六年二月苏联共产党第二十次代表大会开幕的时候，这座总发电能力达二百万瓩的水电站将有三个水轮机在发电了。
