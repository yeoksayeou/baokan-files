　　Since the Shenyang Wire Factory implemented cost accounting for savings at the team level, it has greatly reduced the consumption quotas for the two main raw materials: steel and fuel.
　　Expenditures on steel and fuel account for more than 80% of the factory's total costs. In the past, these two raw materials were wasted the most, with a waste of more than 1.54 million yuan in the first quarter of this year. The factory's wire rod rolling yield rate was only 93.5%. Compared with Anshan Iron and Steel's small rolling mill, if only the roughing stage of rolling is considered, 576 tons of steel would be wasted annually. This factory used more than 220 kilograms of coal to burn one ton of steel billets, while Qiu Guanghe's team at the Tianjin Rolling Mill used only 85 kilograms, a difference of more than 140 kilograms.
　　This spring, the wire factory analyzed the reasons for cost overruns, and since the second quarter, when it began to implement cost accounting for savings at the team level, waste has been greatly reduced. By mid-August, it had saved 256 tons of steel and 437 tons of raw coal, greatly reducing costs. As a result, the factory has comprehensively fulfilled the state plan, and it is expected that by the end of the year, a total of 400 tons of steel and 1,000 tons of raw coal can be saved.
　　The Shenyang Wire Factory has been able to achieve remarkable results mainly because it combines cost accounting for savings at the team level with labor emulation, and regards the requirements of cost accounting for savings at the team level as the content of labor emulation. In the beginning, many people did not recognize this, so the following situation arose: On the one hand, one workshop tried cost accounting for savings at the team level and saved 12 tons of steel and more than 50 tons of coal in 13 days; on the other hand, the trade union was troubled by the lack of a way to overcome the tendency towards formalism in labor emulation, and sat in the office evaluating red flags all day long, unable to make a decision for several days. As a result, the initial achievements of promoting cost accounting for savings at the team level could not be consolidated.
　　To universally promote the requirements of cost accounting for savings at the team level as the content of competition, the work of issuing plans, inspections, and evaluations must be meticulous and timely. This is a question of how to improve the management level of the entire enterprise so that it adapts to the new needs, and also a question of how to improve the enterprise management level through the promotion of cost accounting for savings at the team level. Some department staff believed that the indicators for cost accounting were too complicated to be issued and inspected in a timely manner, and advocated canceling some necessary indicators, such as quality indicators.
　　The Party organization studied this situation and believed that this was a manifestation of fear of trouble. Therefore, the administrative leaders focused on criticizing the fear of trouble among the department staff and organized them to study the labor emulation organization regulations proposed by the trade union and approved by the Party committee. After studying and researching, the planning department formulated the savings indicators to be issued to the workshops based on the enterprise plan, and the workshops then specifically compiled them into teams, so that the indicators for cost accounting for savings at the team level were unified with the requirements of the enterprise plan. The inspection department also reorganized the quality inspection organization and conducted education to strengthen quality inspection. The supply and marketing department and the planning department also established a system to strengthen contact to further accurately grasp the balance of supply, production, and sales. The workshops established and improved systems for waste recovery, shift handover, and other systems to bring production into a normal order.
　　On the basis of strengthening management work, the trade union organized workers to analyze the various indicators, assigned these indicators to various processes, and then formulated guarantees for competition, carried out labor emulation among workers of the same type in different processes, and changed the team's production meetings into production meetings of the same type, which overcame the formalism of having seventy or eighty people in one team and setting a general competition condition, and also overcame the phenomenon of different types of work mixing together in production meetings. This improvement also greatly facilitated the promotion of advanced experience. According to incomplete statistics, fifteen kinds of advanced experiences were promoted among the same types of work in the second quarter alone.
　　After taking the requirements of cost accounting for savings at the team level as the main content of labor emulation, it gradually became the habit of workers to care about the economic effect of daily production. The workers of Shi Chengjin's team in Workshop One found that the cost overrun was more than 11 yuan one day. After work, they held a meeting to study and found that the reason for the cost overrun was that the material feeder was not concentrated in his work and the steel cut-off exceeded the standard. Everyone criticized the worker and helped him calculate the detailed account. The worker also made a self-criticism, guaranteeing that he would concentrate on his work in the future. From that day on, this team never had a cost overrun again.
　　Now, the idea of economic accounting has taken deep root in the minds of the workers. The whole factory is filled with a competition atmosphere of "See who increases production and saves more for the country." In the past, some steel rolling workers would throw short steel billets aside when they encountered them, and then load those short materials into the furnace before leaving work. They called this practice "throwing short materials." If the previous shift "threw short materials," the next shift would also "throw short materials," and the short steel billets would be burned repeatedly several times, wasting five or six hundred kilograms of steel every day as a result. After the implementation of cost accounting for savings at the team level, the steel rolling workers unanimously criticized this idea of disregarding the whole and not caring about state property, strengthened contact with the furnace workers, completely eliminated the phenomenon of "throwing short materials," and could save dozens of tons of heating coal and reduce a lot of steel consumption for the country every month.
　　The phenomenon of burning and melting steel billets in the heating furnace was also a serious waste problem that had not been solved for a long time. The heating furnace managed by Su Quanrong, the group leader of the sixth team, alone, burned and melted an average of more than 450 kilograms of steel every day. After the implementation of cost accounting for savings at the team level, after more than ten days of observation, calculation, and research, the method of raising the furnace top was implemented, and the phenomenon of burning and melting steel billets was finally eliminated. Even some "backward teams" that were previously considered to be so because the leadership did not provide specific assistance were able to overfulfill their tasks every month.
　　The achievements of the Shenyang Wire Factory in implementing cost accounting for savings at the team level prove that the Soviet Union's advanced experience is an effective way to ensure the full development of labor emulation, organize all workers to tap savings potential, and strive for maximum economic results, and can improve the enterprise's management level and cultivate workers' economic accounting ideas in the process.

　　节约竞赛在沈阳线材厂
　　廖宁济
    沈阳线材厂推行班组节约核算以后，大大降低了两项主要原材料——钢材和燃料的消耗定额。
    钢材和燃料的开支，占全厂总成本的百分之八十以上。过去这两种原材料的浪费最大，今年第一季度曾浪费了一百五十四万多元。这个厂的线材压延收合率只达百分之九十三点五，跟鞍钢小型轧钢厂比起来，只大压延二段，一年就要浪费五百七十六吨钢材。这个厂烧一吨钢坯要用二百二十多公斤煤，而天津轧钢厂邱光河班只用八十五公斤，相差一百四十多公斤。
    今年春天，线材厂分析成本超支的原因，并从第二季度开始推行班组节约核算以来，浪费已大大减少。到八月中旬，已节约了钢材二百五十六吨，原煤四百三十七吨，大大降低了成本，全厂因而全面地完成了国家计划，预计到年底，总共可节省钢材四百吨，原煤一千吨。
    沈阳线材厂所以能取得显著的成绩，主要是把班组节约核算同劳动竞赛结合起来，把班组节约核算的要求作为劳动竞赛的内容。在开始的时候，许多人没有认识这一点，所以出现了这样的局面：一方面，有一个工段试行了班组节约核算，十三天内就节约了十二吨钢材和五十多吨煤；另一方面，工会却苦于没有办法来克服劳动竞赛中的形式主义倾向，整天坐在办公室里评红旗，一连几天评不下去。结果，推行班组节约核算所取得的初步成就也不能巩固。
    把班组节约核算的要求作为竞赛内容普遍推广，那末下达计划、检查、评比等工作也要细致、及时。这是如何提高整个企业管理水平，使它适应新的需要的问题，也是怎样通过推行班组节约核算把企业管理水平提高一步的问题。有些科室工作人员认为节约核算的指标太复杂，不好及时下达和检查，主张把一些必要的指标，如质量指标取消。
    党组织研究了这一情况，认为这是怕麻烦思想在作怪。于是行政领导人员便着重地批判了科室工作人员的怕麻烦思想，并组织他们学习工会提出、经党委批准的劳动竞赛组织条例。计划科经学习和研究后，根据企业计划制定了下达车间的节约指标，车间再具体编到班组，使班组节约核算的指标和企业计划的要求统一起来。检查科也整顿了质量检查组织，进行了加强质量检查的教育。供销科和计划科也订出了加强联系的制度，进一步准确地掌握供产销的平衡。车间则建立和健全废品回收、交接班等制度，把生产纳入正常的秩序。
    在加强管理工作的基础上，工会组织工人解剖各个指标，把这些指标分到各个工序里去，然后制定竞赛的保证条件，开展工序之间的同工种劳动竞赛，把班组的生产会议改为同工种的生产会议，这才克服了过去七、八十个人在一个班，订一个笼统的竞赛条件的形式主义的毛病，也克服了过去不同工种混在一起开生产会议的现象。这一改进，也大大地便利了推广先进经验工作。据不完全统计，仅第二季度在同工种之间就推广了十五种先进经验。
    以班组节约核算的要求作为劳动竞赛的主要内容以后，关心每天生产的经济效果，就渐成为职工们的习惯。一车间石成金小组的工人们，有一天发现成本超支十一元多，下班后便开会研究，发现成本超支的原因是续料工人在操作中思想不集中，钢材切头超过了标准。大家批评了那个工人，帮助他算了细账。那个工人也作了检讨，保证以后集中精神干活。从这天起，这个小组再也没发生过成本超支现象。
    现在，经济核算思想已深深地在职工中扎下根。全厂洋溢着“看谁给国家增产节约多”的竞赛气氛。过去有些轧钢工人一遇到短钢坯，就把它甩到一旁，临下班再把那些短料装到炉里。他们把这种做法叫做“甩短料”。上一班“甩短料”，下一班也“甩短料”，短钢坯就被反复烧几次，每天因此而浪费的钢材就达五、六百公斤。推行班组节约核算后，轧钢工人一致批判了这种不顾整体不关心国家财产的思想，加强跟大炉工人的联系，完全消灭了“甩短料”的现象，每月可以给国家节约数十吨加热用煤和减少许多钢材消耗。
    加热炉烧化钢坯的现象也是一个长期没解决的严重浪费问题。仅第六小组大炉组长苏全荣所管的加热炉，平均一天就要烧化四百五十多公斤钢材。推行班组节约核算以后，经过十几天的观察、计算、研究，实行了加高炉顶的办法，烧化钢坯的现象终于被消灭了。就是一些过去由于领导上没给具体帮助而被人们认为是“落后小组”的，也都能月月超额完成任务了。
    沈阳线材厂推行班组节约核算所取得的成就证明了：苏联这一先进经验是保证劳动竞赛饱满开展组织全体职工挖掘节约潜力，为最大的经济效果而斗争的有效办法，并能在这一过程中提高企业管理水平，培养职工的经济核算思想。
