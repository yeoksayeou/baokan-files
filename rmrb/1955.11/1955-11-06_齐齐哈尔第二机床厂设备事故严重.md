To the Editor:

From January to August this year, the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant experienced over 220 equipment accidents. However, this serious problem has not been given sufficient attention by the factory's leadership, leading to an increase in equipment accidents in September. From September 1st to 21st alone, there were 36 machine tool damage accidents, most of which were responsibility accidents caused by violations of operating procedures. For example, on September 11th, Cui Yongqi, a worker in the First Workshop, violated operating procedures while processing universal milling machine parts on a gantry milling machine, causing the top of the worm gear to contact the tooth plate, making the milling machine unable to start. Tian Chenglin, a maintenance worker, blindly turned on the power, damaging the transmission box bearings and gears of this valuable milling machine, resulting in over 150 machine-hours of downtime. Another example is Yan Yintong, a worker in the Third Workshop, who used an "iron chuck" (a steel chuck should have been used according to regulations) to clamp the workpiece when processing universal milling gear parts on a Soviet-style lathe. He did not tighten the workpiece and proceeded with rapid cutting. As a result, the tool broke, the trapezoidal hook of the tool holder was damaged, and the machine was out of service for 79 machine-hours.

The main reason for this situation is that the factory's leadership focuses only on production and rarely inquires about the maintenance of machine tools. Some workshop leaders even arbitrarily transfer workers, resulting in unreasonable phenomena such as lathe operators doing grinding work and planers operating milling machines. This causes many workers to cause accidents due to a lack of technical knowledge and skills. Some section chiefs and workshop directors also conceal accidents and fail to investigate and handle them after they occur, which encourages some workers' erroneous ideas of not cherishing machines. Some workers said: "If you don't take a big cut, you have to pay compensation; if you don't drive fast, you won't meet the quota. Machine tool accidents can be repaired, but who do you go to if you don't earn your basic wage?" Rong Guoguang, a worker in the First Workshop, used two tools and a cutting depth of 19 millimeters, which greatly exceeded the planer's load, in order to earn more quota when processing workbench parts, resulting in a broken transmission shaft.

Machine tools are the lifeblood of a mechanical factory! Any machine tool accident directly affects the completion of the production plan. The leaders of the Qiqihar No. 2 Machine Tool Plant repeatedly say "Production First!" I ask: With so many machine tool accidents, does it not affect the completion of state tasks?

### 齐齐哈尔第二机床厂设备事故严重

    齐齐哈尔第二机床厂设备事故严重编辑同志：
    齐齐哈尔第二机床厂从今年一月到八月发生设备事故二百二十多次。但是，这样严重的问题并没有引起厂里领导工作人员的重视，以致九月份设备事故发生的次数更增多了。从九月一日到二十一日，就发生机床损坏事故三十六次，其中大部分都是由于违犯操作规程而引起的责任事故。例如，九月十一日第一车间工人崔永祺在龙门铣床上加工万能铣机床部件的时候，违犯操作规程，使窝齿轮顶部同牙板齿相接触，铣床不能开动了；保修工人田成林竟盲目通上电流开车，结果把这台贵重铣床的传动箱轴承和牙轮给搞坏了，停车一百五十多个台小时。又如，三车间工人言音桐在使用苏式车床加工万能铣齿轮部件的时候，用“铁抓卡盘”（按规定应该用钢抓卡盘）卡活，活没有卡紧他就快速进刀。结果，刀打掉了，刀架的梯形勾也坏了，停车七十九个台小时。
    造成这种情况的主要原因是，这个厂的领导工作人员只顾生产，而很少过问机床维护保养的情况。有的车间领导工作人员还随便把工人调来调去，造成车工干磨工活、刨工操纵铣床等不合理现象，这就使不少工人由于不懂技术和技术不熟练而造成事故。个别的工段长和车间主任还隐瞒事故，在事故发生后不去查究和处理，这就助长了某些工人不爱护机器的错误思想。有的工人说：“不上大刀得赔钱，不打快车达不到定额；机床事故能修理，挣不到基本工资找谁去？”第一车间工人荣国光在加工工作台部件的时候，为了多挣定额，上了两把刀，并且吃刀深度达到十九个公厘，大大地超过刨床的负荷，结果就造成传动轴折断的事故。
    机床是机械工厂的命根子！任何一台机床发生事故都要直接影响到生产计划的完成。齐齐哈尔第二机床厂领导人员口口声声说“生产第一”；试问：机床事故这么多，难道对于完成国家任务没有影响吗？
