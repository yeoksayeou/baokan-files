　　Iranian Authorities' Atrocities Against Patriots
　　Cui Qi
　　According to Western news agency reports, Dr. Morteza Yazdi, former secretary of the Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party, has been sentenced to death by the Tehran Military Court. All honest people express deep concern for the suffering of this Iranian patriot.

　　Dr. Morteza Yazdi was a renowned Iranian surgeon and physicist, and formerly a professor at Tehran University. In 1946, he served as the Minister of Health in the Iranian government. Dr. Morteza Yazdi was one of the founders of the Iranian People's Party, the party of the Iranian working class and working people. For many years, he tirelessly fought for Iran's national independence, peace, and democracy, and for a bright future for Iran. His entire life and activities were dedicated to the Iranian people. However, the Iranian authorities are now attempting to kill this outstanding people's fighter on trumped-up charges of so-called "treason." This is a completely unreasonable and illegal atrocity.

　　The circumstances of Dr. Morteza Yazdi's trial also prove this point. The Iranian authorities disregarded the judicial system and completely deprived Morteza Yazdi of the opportunity to defend himself. Agence France-Presse reported that "the trial was conducted behind closed doors." Moreover, after Dr. Morteza Yazdi was arrested, he was immediately subjected to extremely barbaric torture, to the extent that his appearance became unrecognizable within a few days. One must ask, why did the Iranian authorities conduct a secret trial of Dr. Morteza Yazdi and inflict such inhumane torture? Clearly, there can only be one answer: the Iranian authorities attempted to fabricate false evidence behind the backs of the Iranian people in order to facilitate their despicable murder plot.

　　While Dr. Morteza Yazdi was being persecuted, Sarvat Shami, a member of the Central Committee of the Iranian People's Party, and Gaulaust Chakhalian, a member of the Tehran Provincial Committee of the People's Party, were also being tortured in prison. In addition to the People's Party members, the Iranian authorities are also conducting a frenzied persecution of other patriots and democrats. According to reports, in recent months, twenty-seven Iranian military officers have been sentenced to death, and one hundred and ninety-two military officers have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Thousands of other Iranian patriots are imprisoned in concentration camps on islands in the Persian Gulf and in prisons in Tehran and elsewhere, facing the threat of death. On the eve of Iran's accession to the Baghdad Pact, the Iranian authorities' persecution of patriots appears particularly brutal. This shows that these atrocities are not isolated incidents.

　　The Iranian authorities' persecution of Dr. Morteza Yazdi has aroused indignation and protest from the Iranian people and world public opinion. The Secretariat of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers has sent telegrams to the King of Iran, the Prime Minister of Iran, and the Iranian Association of Legal Workers, condemning the unreasonable verdict against Dr. Morteza Yazdi. The voices of protest are growing stronger, and the Iranian authorities must immediately cease the persecution of Dr. Morteza Yazdi!

### 伊朗当局迫害爱国者的暴行

　　伊朗当局迫害爱国者的暴行
　　崔奇
　　据西方通讯社报道，前伊朗人民党中央委员会书记莫特扎·雅兹迪博士，已被德黑兰军事法庭判处死刑。一切正直的人们都对这位伊朗爱国者的受难表示深切关怀。
　　莫特扎·雅兹迪博士是伊朗著名的外科医生和物理学家，曾任德黑兰大学教授。一九四六年，他做过伊朗政府的卫生部长。莫特扎·雅兹迪博士是伊朗工人阶级和劳动人民的政党——人民党的创始者之一。许多年来，他始终不倦地为争取伊朗的民族独立、和平和民主而奋斗，为争取伊朗的美好未来而奋斗，他的全部生活和活动都是忠于伊朗人民的。但是，伊朗当局竟以莫须有的所谓“叛国”罪名，要来杀害这位卓越的人民战士。这完全是无理的非法的暴行。
    对莫特扎·雅兹迪博士的审讯情况，也证明了这一点。伊朗当局不遵守司法制度，根本剥夺了莫特扎·雅兹迪进行辩护的机会。法新社报道，“审讯是在禁止旁听的情况下进行的。”而且，莫特扎·雅兹迪博士被捕以后，立即受到极端野蛮的刑罚，以致过了不几天，他的外貌就变得认不得了。人们要问，伊朗当局为什么要对莫特扎·雅兹迪博士进行秘密审讯，并施行如此惨无人道的刑罚呢？显然，答案只能有一个，伊朗当局企图背着伊朗人民，制造假证据，以便于他们实现卑鄙的谋杀计划。
    在莫特扎·雅兹迪博士遭受迫害的同时，伊朗人民党中央委员萨尔瓦特·夏密尼和人民党德黑兰省委员会委员盖劳斯特·查克哈利安，也在狱中遭受酷刑。除了人民党人以外，伊朗当局也对其他的爱国者和民主人士进行疯狂的迫害。据报道，最近几个月来，有二十七名伊朗军官被判处死刑，有一百九十二名军官被判处无期徒刑。还有几千名伊朗爱国者被监禁在波斯湾海岛上的集中营里和德黑兰等地的监狱里，受着死亡的威胁。在伊朗加入巴格达条约前夕，伊朗当局对爱国者的迫害显得特别残酷。由此可见，这些暴行并不是偶然的事件。
    伊朗当局对莫特扎·雅兹迪博士的迫害，已经引起伊朗人民和世界舆论的愤慨和抗议。国际民主法律工作者协会书记处就曾致电伊朗国王、伊朗首相和伊朗法律工作者联盟，谴责对莫特扎·雅兹迪博士的无理判决。抗议的声音日益强大，伊朗当局必须立即停止对莫特扎·雅兹迪博士的迫害！
