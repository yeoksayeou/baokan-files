In the process of establishing cooperatives in Minlang Town, Minhou County, Fujian Province, some new and old upper-middle peasants were ideologically disturbed due to insufficient understanding of the policies. Jiang Dalin, an old upper-middle peasant, was afraid that if he didn't join the cooperative now, he wouldn't be able to later, so he prepared to sell his cattle and waterwheels and signed up to join the cooperative. Jiang Tongzheng, a new upper-middle peasant, was afraid that people would say his class background was not good, so he went to the township cadres every day to ask to sign up. Some households were worried that if they didn't join the cooperative, the unified purchase quota would be increased, and they were afraid that they wouldn't be able to buy fertilizer. There were many concerns.

After discovering this situation, the Party branch held a forum for middle peasants (mainly upper-middle peasants). Addressing their ideological concerns, they explained the policy of developing cooperatives in batches and the policy of voluntary mutual benefit. After the meeting, they conducted individual interviews to answer their questions. The emotions of the new and old upper-middle peasants generally stabilized. After holding the forum and individual interviews, nine of the thirty-seven new and old upper-middle peasant households who originally did not understand the policies well volunteered to join the cooperative this year, and the other twenty-eight households also expressed their willingness to engage in production outside the cooperative with peace of mind and join the cooperative later.

　  召集中农座谈会
    福建闽侯县闽琅镇在建社过程中，有些新老上中农因为对政策了解不够，思想动荡不安。老上中农江达林怕现在不入社以后入不了，张罗卖耕牛、水车，报名入社；新上中农江通政怕人家说他成分不好，整天找乡干部要求报名；还有些户怕不入社加重统购任务，怕不入社买不到肥田粉，顾虑很多。
      党支部发现这个情况后，就召开了一个中农座谈会（主要是上中农），针对他们的思想顾虑，说明合作社分批发展的方针和自愿互利政策，会后又分别进行了个别谈话，解答了他们的疑问，新老上中农情绪普遍安定。经过召开座谈会和个别谈话，本来对政策了解不够的三十七户新老上中农，有九户自愿在今年入社，别的二十八户也表示在社外安心生产，以后再入社。
