Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 9th (TASS):

Mr. Chairman, Gentlemen,

    At the previous meeting on November 4th, Mr. Dulles, on behalf of the delegations of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France, put forward suggestions concerning the German question related to holding all-German elections. The Soviet delegation has thoroughly considered and studied these suggestions. Today, we have also heard speeches by Mr. Pinay and Mr. Macmillan expressing support for the three-power suggestions. In this regard, the Soviet delegation believes it is necessary to make the following explanations. Mr. Dulles's suggestion stated that it was put forward "in accordance with the plan proposed by the Western three powers on October 28th." The entire content of the aforementioned suggestion proves this point. Therefore, the suggestion put forward by the three-power delegations on November 4th does not propose anything new compared to the suggestion of October 28th. The three-power suggestion of October 28th showed that their aim was to remilitarize not only West Germany but also East Germany, and to drag not only West Germany but also the whole of Germany into the North Atlantic bloc, which is directed against the Soviet Union—in fact, not only against the Soviet Union. Needless to prove, the Soviet Union cannot agree to this aim and cannot help achieve this aim. The Soviet people know German militarism too well, and they themselves cannot help revive German militarism. They know that the revival of German militarism is incompatible with maintaining peace and the security of the people of European countries.

    Mr. Dulles's suggestion stated that it had reached agreement with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, it did not take into account the views of the government of the German Democratic Republic.

    However, in order to formulate a truly acceptable suggestion regarding the reunification of Germany, one must consider not only the views of the Federal Republic of Germany but also the views of the German Democratic Republic. The three-power delegations did not even think about considering the statement issued by the government of the German Democratic Republic a few days ago. Therefore, their suggestion is unrealistic.

    Naturally, the Four Powers bear a clear responsibility for resolving the German question and must strive to enable Germany to rebuild its life on a democratic and peaceful basis. It has always been considered that the Four Powers must be supported by the efforts made by the German people themselves for this purpose.

    Ten years ago, the situation was that Germany had just surrendered unconditionally, and there was no German authority working on German territory that could take responsibility for Germany's destiny. Since then, much time has passed, and the situation in Germany has undergone fundamental changes. On German territory, there is not a single country, but two Germanys—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. This fact has been recognized in well-known international documents.

    In September 1949, the Federal Republic of Germany emerged. It passed its own constitution, formed a parliament, government, and other organs of power. In this country, large monopoly capital and Junkers maintain their rule. It signed the Paris Agreements with the Western three powers—the United States, Britain, and France—joined the military groups of Western countries, and joined the North Atlantic bloc and the Western European Union.

    The Soviet Union does not agree with certain aspects of the development of the Federal Republic of Germany and believes that the practice of reviving militarism in the Federal Republic of Germany according to the Paris Agreements is dangerous to peace. However, in order to consolidate peace, the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. It believes that, under certain conditions, this can promote the final resolution of the German question, but we are by no means willing to underestimate the difficulties on this road.

    On the other hand, in the east of Germany, another German state was established in October 1949—the German Democratic Republic. In this country, the working people: workers, peasants, and laboring intellectuals, hold power. At the same time, private enterprises also have the opportunity to develop.

    The establishment of the German Democratic Republic is a turning point in German history and also a turning point in the history of the whole of Europe. For the first time, the German working people have their own true homeland in the form of the German Democratic Republic—a German state without large monopoly capital and Junkers, where the working people have become the masters of their own country.

    At the same time, for the first time in Europe, a truly peace-loving Germany has been established, which does not threaten the people of other European countries at all. Everyone knows that this country has expressed its agreement to participate in the establishment of a European collective security system, willing to make efforts aimed at approaching and cooperating with the Federal Republic of Germany, in order to create the necessary conditions for unifying Germany on a peaceful and democratic basis. It cannot be agreed with the statement: it seems that European security cannot be guaranteed before the restoration of German unity. The participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the European security system will be a major contribution to guaranteeing the development of the people of European countries in a peaceful environment.

    The German Democratic Republic, like the Federal Republic of Germany, has established diplomatic and trade relations with many countries. It enjoys the rights of a sovereign state and freely handles its own foreign policy and domestic policy issues. One must not ignore or underestimate the fact that the consolidated German Democratic Republic with a population of 18 million exists. Whether some people are happy or not, the German Democratic Republic has stood firm and is developing victoriously.

    The German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union recently signed a treaty based on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. The purpose of the participants in the treaty is to promote the maintenance and consolidation of European peace and security and to promote the reunification of Germany into a peaceful and democratic state. The Soviet Union is developing its relations with the German Democratic Republic in accordance with this treaty, and we cannot take actions that violate the obligations of this treaty. We will not make such violations.

    This is the actual situation in Germany that has been formed since the end of the European war ten years ago. This situation must be taken into account when discussing issues related to Germany.

    All this shows that the position of the three countries on the German question is not constructive and is unrealistic because it does not take into account the actual situation of things.

    There has been much talk here about the Western countries' election system, which is the election struggle between parties for parliamentary seats. However, in the elections that Mr. Dulles, Mr. Pinay, and Mr. Macmillan talked about, in the final analysis, the question is only whether the government resigns or continues to stay in office. Everyone knows that even without new elections, this change of government often happens.

    The question of all-German elections is not an ordinary change of government. The German elections are a question concerning the fate of the country, and it is a question of deciding whether a unified Germany will develop into a peaceful and democratic country or will become a militarist country, threatening its neighbors again.

    Here it is suggested to pass an all-German election plan as a means of reunifying Germany. On the one hand, as I have explained above, this plan ignores the actual situation in Germany because the question of carrying out such elections has not yet matured. On the other hand, even if we agree to this artificial plan, we cannot implement this plan without the consent of the Germans living in the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany. Finally, the mechanical merger of the two parts of Germany, implemented through so-called "free elections" (according to the provisions of the "Eden Plan," such elections should also be carried out in the presence of foreign troops), will infringe upon the vital interests of the working people of the German Democratic Republic, and people cannot agree with this practice. Of course, we cannot agree to take factories, land, and underground resources from the hands of the working people of the German Democratic Republic. It can be seen from this that the intention to implement the so-called "Eden Plan" will seriously complicate the internal situation in Germany. Needless to say, none of us would want to see this happen.

    Therefore, only by fully taking into account the following situation can it help to find the right way to solve the German question, that is, to take into account the existence of two different German states on German territory, and the reunification of Germany cannot be realized unless through an agreement between the two countries.

    Everyone knows that now, in the relationship between the two parts of Germany, there is no mutual trust that is necessary for the restoration of German unity. Representatives of one part of Germany—the Federal Republic of Germany—are even unwilling to meet with representatives of the other part of Germany—the German Democratic Republic. In this case, the task of the four countries is to do everything possible to help establish this trust, help the two Germanys approach each other, and arrange their cooperation. At the same time, it cannot be considered that the Germans in East and West Germany are less concerned about the restoration of German unity than the Americans, French, British, or Russians.

    Speaking of this, we believe it is necessary to reiterate what the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, said at the summit meeting. He said at the time: "If we talk about ways to restore German unity, then we cannot but think that, in the current situation, the only way to promote the achievement of this goal is to bring the two parts of Germany closer, eliminate the friction and tension that now exist between them, and create an atmosphere of cooperation between them.

    Life itself determines that the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany must approach each other. ...Of course, our direct task is to vigorously promote the approach of the two parts of Germany and promote the establishment and development of normal relations between the two parts of Germany and other countries. Doing so will not only help the cause of German unity but also help maintain European peace."

    The path to restoring German unity on a peaceful and democratic basis can and should be sought, although this path will not be short and smooth under the current conditions. It takes time, patience, and perseverance. We believe that the establishment of an all-German committee is such a path. The all-German committee will be able to first coordinate the corresponding activities of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in the political, economic, and cultural life that involve all-German interests, and coordinate their activities in consolidating European peace and security. There are many common problems—trade problems, transportation problems between East and West Germany, and other problems, and agreed decisions on these problems are beneficial to all Germans. Agreed decisions on these problems will promote the development of comprehensive cooperation between the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and create conditions for resolving the German question and restoring German unity through free elections in accordance with the national interests of the German people and the interests of European Security.

    All of this leads us to the conclusion that further discussion on the German question can only be beneficial when the Germans themselves find a common language and take on the responsibility of preparing to resolve the German question. The discussion at the meeting once again proved that there is no other way to solve the German question.

    The representatives of the Western countries have not yet stated their attitude towards the suggestion of establishing an all-German committee. However, it cannot be ignored that the above suggestion takes into account the actual situation in Germany, it will indeed lead to the approach of the two Germanys, and create the premise for restoring German unity, without harming the interests of the existing two Germanys, and without affecting the social systems of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    At the same time, this also answers Mr. Pinay's opinion on the internal conditions for unified Germany.

    As for the suggestions put forward here by the Western three countries, in fact, these suggestions will lead to the revival of imperialist Germany, that is, to implement the Paris Agreements to the whole of Germany, to restore the rule of large monopoly capital, Junkers, and militarists in the whole of Germany, and to abolish the democratic and social reforms and freedom obtained by the working people of the German Democratic Republic. However, the revival of such an imperialist and militarist Germany is incompatible with the interests of European peace and security, because it would restore the position of aggressive German militarism, which was destroyed during the war and after the war due to the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, thereby deepening the danger of a new European war. The people of European countries who care about maintaining and consolidating peace will not agree to do this. Rebuilding such a militarist Germany is particularly dangerous for its neighbors, for countries like France and Poland, and for all peace-loving countries in Europe.

    Mr. Dulles said here that the United States does not recognize the German Democratic Republic. But this does not change the actual situation. The question of recognition is a matter of time, and the German Democratic Republic—the country of German workers and peasants—has a great future because it is walking along the broad road of human development and has strong and loyal friends.

    Some people, especially Mr. Macmillan, insisted here that the Soviet Union seems to have changed its attitude towards the German question taken at the Berlin Conference in January 1954, saying that the Soviet government once thought that all-German elections could be agreed to. It is true that at that time we agreed that all-German elections could be carried out under certain conditions, but our suggestions were not considered. Almost two years have passed since then, and the situation has changed greatly—the Paris Agreements have come into effect, West Germany has opposed itself to East Germany, has taken many overt or covert measures of remilitarization, has joined military blocs (including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization), and has accepted the command of the joint military command of the Western countries. How can one not take into account everything that has happened in these two years? How can we talk about all-German elections in this situation?

    It is also remembered that when discussing the Paris Agreements, it was once said that after the ratification of this agreement, it would be possible to negotiate the German question with the Soviet Union from a "position of strength." Now, when the Paris Agreements have been fully implemented, it can be clearly seen that this attempt will not have any result on the German question or on any other question. It is also necessary to remind another point: we have pointed out more than once that the Paris Agreements destroyed the possibility of a unified Germany and created insurmountable obstacles on this road. However, this point has not been taken seriously.

    Under these conditions, the task of unifying Germany can no longer be completed in the same way as before the signing of the Paris Agreements. The fact that changes have taken place in the social and political development of East and West Germany since this period must be taken into account.

    At present, the task of unifying Germany can only be completed gradually, step by step, through the approach and cooperation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    As early as the summit conference of the four governments, the Soviet government denied the plan to mechanically merge the two parts of Germany, because this plan obviously violated the interests of European peace and security and was not in line with the national interests of the German people. Now, the Soviet position is still the same.

    All of this also shows that the main problem in the three-power suggestion is not the unified Germany, nor the carrying out of all-German elections. In the three-power suggestion, these two things are completely subordinate to the basic purpose they pointed out in the document of October 28. In this document, it is written that the treaty "will finally come into effect when the unified Germany decides to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union." It can be seen from this that this plan is a tool that some people want to use to achieve the goal of remilitarizing not only West Germany but the entire Germany and participating in the Western military blocs.

    All of this convinces us that the Western three countries' suggestions on the German question have nothing to do with guaranteeing European security.

    For the people of European countries, such a Germany is dangerous, whether it participates in the military blocs of Western countries or organizes military blocs in Europe itself. If the road to turning Germany into a militarist country is not blocked, the danger of a new war will increase immeasurably. The people of European countries facing this danger cannot rely on the so-called restrictions and supervision within the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union. Based on experience, they know that these restrictions are worthless because the rising German militarism will throw them away like waste paper again.

    The heads of government of the four countries instructed us to discuss European security and the German question. Starting from the main goal of establishing European security, we accepted the entrustment of our heads of government to discuss various suggestions to achieve this goal, among which the first is the convention on European or part of European security. At the same time, the heads of government determined some important principles of the convention on European or part of European security in the instructions to our meeting. These principles in the instructions include the following:

    Provisions on member states undertaking the obligation not to use force and not to assist aggressors;

    Implementation of restrictions, supervision and inspection of armed forces and armaments;

    Establishment of a region between East and West, within which agreements must be reached with each other regarding the deployment of armed forces.

    It has been pointed out here that some of these principles are in both the Soviet delegation's suggestions on European security and the three-power delegations' suggestions. We can notice this point. But we cannot but point out that we have not reached an agreement on some basic issues, such as the issue of guaranteeing European security on the basis of canceling military blocs and the issue of Germany's participation in the European collective security system.

    The Soviet delegation put forward its suggestions on European security and the German question from this position of the Soviet government and in accordance with the instructions of the heads of government of the four countries.

    Our suggestions take into account the interests of European countries and the national interests of the German people. These suggestions are based on realistic considerations of the situation. These suggestions cannot easily solve complex international problems, especially the German question—unfortunately, such a solution does not exist under the current conditions.

    Our suggestion to establish an all-German committee provides the possibility for the real approach of the two Germanys. We believe that this first all-German institution since World War II will play a historically significant role in creating the external and internal conditions for the reunification of Germany.

### 十一月八日在四国外交部长会议上  莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全和德国问题的发言

专栏：

    十一月八日在四国外交部长会议上
    莫洛托夫关于欧洲安全和德国问题的发言主席先生，各位先生，
    在十一月四日的前次会议上，杜勒斯先生代表美国、联合王国和法国三国代表团提出了有关举行全德选举的关于德国问题的建议。苏联代表团已经彻底考虑和研究了这些建议。今天我们还听取了比内先生和麦克米伦先生表示支持三国建议的发言。在这方面，苏联代表团认为有必要作如下说明。杜勒斯先生的建议说，它是“按照西方三国在十月二十八日提出的计划”提出的。上述建议的整个内容证明了这一点。因此，三国代表团在十一月四日提出的建议和十月二十八日的建议比起来没有提出任何新的东西。十月二十八日的三国建议显示，它们的目的是要不仅使西德而且同样使东德重新军国主义化，是要在以后不仅把西德而且还把整个德国拖入针对苏联——事实上，不仅是针对苏联——的北大西洋集团。毋须证明，苏联是不能赞成这种目的，是不能帮助达到这种目的的。苏联人民对德国军国主义认识得太清楚了，他们自己是不能帮助复活德国军国主义的。他们知道，复活德国军国主义和维护和平和欧洲各国人民的安全是不相容的。
    杜勒斯先生的建议说，它已经同德意志联邦共和国的政府取得了一致意见。但是，它却没有考虑到德意志民主共和国政府的意见。
    然而，为了拟订一项真正可以令人接受的关于德国重新统一问题的建议，人们不仅必须考虑德意志联邦共和国的意见，而且还必须考虑德意志民主共和国的意见。三国代表团甚至没有想考虑一下德意志民主共和国政府前几天发表的声明。因此，它们的建议是不现实的。
    自然，四大国对解决德国问题负有明确的责任，并且必须努力使德国能在民主和和平的基础上重建它的生活。人们始终认为：四大国必须受到德国人民自己为了这种目的而作的努力的支持。
    十年前的情况是，当时德国刚刚无条件地投降，在德国领土上没有一个能对德国的命运负起责任的德国当局进行工作。自从那时以来，已经过了许多时日了，德国的情况已经发生了根本的变化。在德国的领土上的并不是一个单独的国家，而是两个德国——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国。这个事实已经在大家都知道的国际文献中得到承认。
    一九四九年九月，出现了德意志联邦共和国，它通过了自己的宪法，组成了议会、政府和其他政权机构。在这个国家中，大垄断资本和容克地主保持着自己的统治，它同西方三国——美国、英国和法国签订了巴黎协定，参加了西方国家的军事集团，参加了北大西洋集团和西欧联盟。
    苏联对德意志联邦共和国发展的某些方面是不表赞同的，并且认为，根据巴黎协定在德意志联邦共和国复活军国主义的做法对和平说来是危险的。可是，苏联为了巩固和平，同德意志联邦共和国建立了外交关系，它认为，在某种条件下，这是可以促进德国问题的最后解决的，不过我们决不愿对这条道路上的困难估计不足。
    另一方面，德国的东部在一九四九年十月成立了另外一个德意志国家——德意志民主共和国，在这个国家中执掌政权的是劳动人民：工人、农民、劳动知识分子。同时，私人企业也有发展的机会。
    德意志民主共和国的成立是德国历史上的转折点，也是整个欧洲历史上的转折点。德国劳动人民第一次有了德意志民主共和国这样一个自己的真正的祖国——没有大垄断资本和容克地主的德意志国家，这里的劳动人民成了自己国家的主人。
    同时在欧洲第一次建立了一个真正爱好和平的、一点也不威胁其他欧洲国家人民的德国。大家知道，这个国家已经表示同意参加建立欧洲集体安全体系，愿意作出旨在同德意志联邦共和国接近和合作的努力，以便为在和平和民主的基础上统一德国创造必要条件。决不能同意这种说法：似乎在恢复德国统一以前不能够保障欧洲安全。德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国参加欧洲安全体系，将是对保障欧洲各国人民在和平环境中发展的一个重大贡献。
    德意志民主共和国，像德意志联邦共和国一样，已经同许许多多的国家建立了外交关系和贸易关系。它享有一个主权国家的权利，并且自由地处理自己的外交政策和国内政策的问题。决不能忽视或者低估拥有一千八百万人口的巩固的德意志民主共和国的存在这一事实。不管某些人是不是高兴，德意志民主共和国已经坚强地站起来，并且在胜利地发展中。
    德意志民主共和国和苏联不久前签订了以完全平等、相互尊重主权和互不干涉内政的原则为基础的条约。条约参加者的目的是要促进维护和巩固欧洲和平和安全以及促进德国重新统一为一个和平民主的国家。苏联根据这一条约发展它同德意志民主共和国的关系，我们不能够采取破坏这一条约的义务的行为。我们将不会作出这种破坏行为。
    这就是自从欧洲战争结束后十年以来形成的德国的实际情况。在讨论有关德国的问题时不能不考虑到这种情况。
    这一切说明，三国在德国问题上的立场并不具有建设性质，这种立场是不现实的，因为它没有考虑到事物的实际情况。
    在这里关于西方国家的选举制度谈得不少，也就是各党派之间争夺议会席位的选举斗争。但是，在杜勒斯先生、比内先生和麦克米伦先生讲到的那种选举中，归根结蒂，问题只不过是政府是否辞职或者继续留任。大家知道，即使没有新的选举，政府的这种更换也是常常发生的。
    关于全德选举的问题，这不是一个普通的更换政府的问题。德国的选举是一个有关国家命运的问题，而且是一个决定统一后的德国是将发展成为一个和平民主的国家，还是将变成一个军国主义国家，重新威胁它的邻国的问题。
    在这里有人建议通过一个全德选举计划作为重新统一德国的手段。一方面，正如我上面所说明的，这个计划忽略了德国的实际情况，因为关于进行这种选举的问题还没有成熟。另一方面，即使我们同意这种人为的计划，我们也不能够不征得住在德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的德国人自己的同意就把这个计划付诸实行。最后，通过所谓“自由选举”（依照“艾登计划”的规定，这种选举而且要在外国军队存在的情况下进行）而实行的德国两部分的机械合并，将会侵犯德意志民主共和国劳动人民的切身利益，对这种做法人们是不能够同意的。当然，我们是不能够同意从德意志民主共和国劳动人民的手中夺走工厂、土地和地下富源的。由此可见，实现所谓“艾登计划”的打算将使德国内部情况严重地复杂化，不用说，我们任何人都不会愿意看到这种情况发生的。
    因此，只有充分地考虑到下列情况才能有助于寻找正确解决德国问题的办法，这就是要考虑到在德国领土上存在有两个不同的德意志国家，除非通过这两个国家的双方协议，德国的重新统一就不能够实现。
    大家都知道，现在在德国两部分之间的关系中，还没有恢复德国统一所必需的那种相互的信任。德国的一部分——德意志联邦共和国的代表甚至还不愿意同德国的另一部分——德意志民主共和国的代表会见。在这种情况下，四国的任务就是尽一切办法来帮助建立这种信任，帮助两个德国接近和安排它们之间的合作。同时，不能认为，东德和西德的德国人对恢复德国统一的关心不及美国人、法国人、英国人或者是俄国人。
    谈到这里，我们认为必须重提一下苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁在政府首脑会议上所说的话。他当时曾说：“如果谈到恢复德国统一的办法，则不能不认为，在目前的情况下，唯有使德国两部分接近，消除它们之间的现在存在的摩擦和紧张局面，以及形成它们合作的气氛，才是促使达到这一目的的最好办法。
    生活本身决定了德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国必须接近。……当然，我们的直接工作是大力促进德国两个部分接近起来，促进德国两个部分和其他国家建立和发展正常关系，这样做将不但有助于德国统一的事业，而且有助于维护欧洲和平。”
    可以而且应该寻求在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国统一的途径，虽然在现在的条件下这种途径不会是短的和平坦的。需要时间、忍耐和坚毅精神。我们认为，建立全德委员会就是这样的一条途径，全德委员会将能够首先把德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国在政治、经济和文化生活各方面的牵涉到全德利益的相应活动协调起来，把它们在巩固欧洲和平和安全方面的活动协调起来。有着许多共同的问题——贸易问题、东西德之间的交通问题和其他问题，就这些问题取得一致同意的决定是有利于所有德国人的。就这些问题取得一致同意的决定将促使德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国之间的全面合作的发展，将为按照德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益通过自由选举解决德国问题和恢复德国统一创造条件。
    这一切使我们得出结论：只有当德国人自己找到共同的语言并且把准备解决德国问题的责任担当起来的时候，才能对德国问题作有益的进一步讨论。在会议上的讨论又一次证明，解决德国问题是没有别的途径的。
    西方国家的代表还没有说明自己对建立全德委员会的建议的态度。但是，不能不看到，上述建议考虑到了德国的实际情况，它的确将导致两个德国的接近，并且创造恢复德国统一的前提，而又不损害现有的两个德国的利益，不影响德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的社会制度。
    同时，这也对比内先生关于统一德国的内部条件的意见作了回答。
    至于西方三国在这里提出的建议，实际上这些建议将导致帝国主义德国的复活，也就是要把巴黎协定推行到整个德国，要在全德恢复大垄断资本、容克地主和军国主义者的统治，取消德意志民主共和国劳动人民所获得的民主和社会改革以及自由。但是，这种帝国主义和军国主义的德国的复活是同欧洲的和平和安全的利益不相容的，因为这就会恢复侵略性的德国军国主义在战争时期和在战后由于德意志民主共和国的成立而被摧毁的地位，从而加深欧洲新战争的危险。关心维护和巩固和平的欧洲各国人民不会同意这样做。重建这样一个军国主义德国对它的邻国，对像法国、波兰这样一些国家，以及对欧洲所有爱好和平的国家说来，是特别危险的。
    杜勒斯先生在这里说过，美国不承认德意志民主共和国。但是这并不改变实际的情况。承认的问题是时间的问题，而德意志民主共和国——德国工人和农民的国家，是有伟大的前途的，因为它正在沿着全人类发展的康庄大道走去，并且有着强大和忠实的朋友。
    有人，特别是麦克米伦先生在这里硬说，苏联似乎改变了在一九五四年一月在柏林会议上对德国问题采取的态度，说当时苏联政府曾经认为可以同意全德选举。不错，当时我们是同意可以在一定的条件下进行全德选举的，但是我们的建议并没有得到考虑。从那时以后差不多两年过去了，而局面已经大大改变了——巴黎协定生效了，西德把自己同东德对立起来，采取了许多公开的或者不公开的重新军国主义化的措施，加入了军事集团（其中包括北大西洋公约组织），并且接受了西方国家集团联合军事司令部的指挥。怎么可以不考虑到这两年内发生的一切事情呢？在这种情况下怎么能够谈全德选举呢？
    人们还记得，在讨论巴黎协定的时候曾经有人说过，这个协定批准后，就能从“实力地位”出发同苏联谈判德国问题了。现在，当巴黎协定已经全部实施的时候，可以明显地看出，这种企图不论是在德国问题或者是在其它任何问题上，都是不会有任何结果的。也不能不提醒另外一点：我们不止一次地指出，巴黎协定破坏了统一德国的可能性，并且在这条路上造成了不可克服的障碍。但是，这一点并没有受到重视。
    在这种条件下，统一德国的任务已经不可能像在巴黎协定签订以前那样来完成了，不能不考虑这个时期以来东德和西德在社会发展和政治发展方面发生了变化这个事实。
    目前，统一德国的任务只能通过德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近和合作的方式，逐渐地、一步步地完成。
    还在四国政府首脑会议上，苏联政府就否定了机械地合并德国两个部分的计划，因为这个计划明显地违反了欧洲和平和安全的利益，而且是不符合德国人民的民族利益的。现在，苏联的立场还是这样。
    这一切同时也说明了三国建议中的主要问题并不是统一德国，也不是进行全德选举。在三国建议中，这两件事完全是从属于他们在十月二十八日那个文件里所指出的基本目的。在这个文件里写道，条约“在统一后的德国决定参加北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟时最后生效”。由此可见，这个计划是一个工具，有人想借助于这个工具来达到不仅使西德而且使整个德国重新军国主义化和参加西方军事集团的目的。
    所有这一切使我们相信西方三国的关于德国问题的建议同保障欧洲安全毫无关系。
    对于欧洲各国人民说来，这样的德国是危险的，不管它是参加西方国家的军事集团，还是它自己在欧洲组织军事集团。如果不堵住把德国变为军国主义国家的道路，新战争的危险将就会无可计量地增长。面临着这种危险的欧洲各国人民不能够靠那些在北大西洋公约组织和西欧联盟的范围内的所谓限制和监督。他们根据经验，知道这种限制是不值钱的，因为抬头的德国军国主义又会把它们当作废纸一样地抛掉。
    四国政府首脑指示我们讨论欧洲安全和德国问题。从建立欧洲安全这个主要的目的出发，我们接受我们的政府首脑的委托来讨论要达到这个目的的各种建议，其中首先是关于欧洲或者欧洲一部分的安全的公约。同时，政府首脑在给我们的会议的指示中确定了关于欧洲或者欧洲一部分的安全的公约的一些重要原则。指示中的这些原则包括下列各项：
    关于成员国承担不使用武力和不援助侵略者的义务的规定；
    对武装部队和军备实行限制、监督和视察；
    在东西方之间建立一个地区，在这个地区之内，对于武装部队的部署必须彼此取得协议。
    这里曾经指出过，这些原则中的某几条，在苏联代表团的关于欧洲安全问题的建议和三国代表团的建议中都有。我们可以注意到这一点。可是我们不能不指出，在一些基本问题上，如在取消军事集团的基础上保障欧洲安全的问题以及德国参加欧洲集体安全体系的问题等，我们还没有达成协议。
    苏联代表团从苏联政府的这种立场出发，并且根据四国政府首脑的指示，提出了它对欧洲安全和德国问题的建议。
    我们这些建议是照顾到欧洲各国的利益和德国人民的民族利益的。这些建议是以对局势的现实的考虑为基础的。这些建议不可能使复杂的国际问题，特别是德国问题，得到轻易的解决——很遗憾，这样的解决在目前的条件下是没有的。
    我们关于建立全德委员会的建议替两个德国的真正接近提供了可能性。我们相信，这个第二次世界大战以后的第一个全德机构将对创造德国重新统一的外部条件和内部条件起具有历史意义的作用。
