　　Jiangxi Completes Winter Crop Seed Supply Work
    The Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has this year transferred 5 million jin of broad bean seeds, more than 600,000 jin of rice and wheat seeds, 400,000 jin of red clover seeds, and more than 40,000 jin of Shengli (Victory) rapeseed from Hubei and Sichuan provinces to supply farmers in various regions for planting. At present, these seeds have been transported to various places, solving the problem of seed shortage in winter planting throughout the province. In order to prepare for next year's spring plowing production, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Agriculture has also actively carried out seed procurement work. According to preliminary statistics from thirty counties, 22.34 million jin of early and mid-season rice seeds have been purchased, including improved varieties such as Nantet number, long-grain indica, Shengli indica, farmer's double-season early rice, and farmer's single-season early rice. Based on the current procurement situation, the province will basically be self-sufficient in seeds next year.

　　江西完成冬种种籽供应工作
    江西省农业厅今年从湖北、四川两省调运了蚕豆种五百万斤、稻麦种六十多万斤、红花草籽四十万斤和胜利油菜籽四万多斤供应各地农民播种。目前这些种籽已分别运至各地，解决了全省冬种中缺种问题。江西省农业厅为了给明年春耕生产作好准备，还积极开展了种籽收购工作。据目前三十个县的初步统计，已收购了二千二百三十四万斤早、中稻种，其中包括南特号良种、长粒籼、胜利籼、农家二季早稻，农家一季早稻等良种，根据目前收购的情况来看，明年全省种籽基本上已可自给自足。
