Engels on Agricultural Cooperativization
　　——Commemorating the 135th Anniversary of Engels' Birth
　　Chen Changhao
　　The founders of scientific socialism, Marx and Engels, based on a scientific analysis of capitalist society, not only proved that the capitalist system would inevitably perish and transition to a socialist society without exploitation, but also proved that the proletariat could and must unite all exploited working masses, mainly the peasant masses, to carry out the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the capitalist system and build a socialist society. Marx and Engels, proceeding from the interests of the proletariat's liberation cause, regarded the peasantry as a "very important element of population, production, and political power," and the peasant question as the question of the proletariat's allies, believing that before the victory of the proletarian revolution, if a peasant struggle against exploitation and oppression occurred, the proletarian revolution would gain a chorus, "Without this chorus, its solo in all peasant countries would become a lone cry." Therefore, the proletariat must unite with the laboring peasants to fight for the overthrow of the bourgeoisie's regime. After seizing power, in order to consolidate the revolutionary regime and build socialism, the working class must attract the broad masses of peasants to participate in the cause of socialist transformation. "The more peasants we can absorb to our side without actually transforming them into proletarians but still keeping them as peasants, the more quickly and easily the social transformation will proceed." The theory and strategy of proletarian revolution formulated by the founders of scientific socialism include the theory and strategy of the proletariat leading the peasants in revolutionary struggle. In the peasant question, Engels, as "the most outstanding scholar and mentor of the proletariat in the entire civilized world" after Marx's death, also made great contributions. He not only elaborated on Marx's theory and strategy that peasants would inevitably go bankrupt under the capitalist system, that peasants were the natural allies of the proletariat, and that the proletariat must unite with the laboring peasants to seize power, but also creatively proposed that after the victory of the proletarian revolution, in order to make the relations of production suitable for the development of productive forces, it was necessary to transform the small-peasant economy and implement agricultural cooperativization. Engels's brilliant ideas on agricultural cooperativization are concentrated in his 1894 work, "The Peasant Question in France and Germany." Although this idea was primarily a program for proletarian parties to attract broad masses of peasants to participate in the revolutionary struggle before seizing power, it was also a program for proletarian parties to guide the broad masses of peasants toward socialism after seizing power. Today, as the high tide of our country's socialist agricultural cooperativization movement has arrived, it is very necessary for us to earnestly study Engels's principles on the agricultural cooperativization issue.

　　The Path of Agricultural Cooperativization Is the Only Path to Liberate Peasants
　　Engels specifically analyzed the situation of the rural population in Western countries, especially France and Germany, believing that in such countries where the small-peasant economy was dominant, as long as the capitalist form of production existed, the small-peasant economy would inevitably go bankrupt, and most peasants would inevitably be on the verge of extinction. Because the characteristics of this small-peasant economy, which is based on individual private ownership, are scattered management, backward technology, and extremely low commodity production rate, it is not only impossible to realize expanded reproduction, but even simple reproduction is impossible. The oppression of taxes, crop failures, and usury makes "their situation worse and worse." The economic laws of capitalist development—large economies squeezing out small economies, large production overwhelming small production—inevitably destroy individual operations in rural areas and lead to the rapid bankruptcy of the broad masses of peasants. "The development of the capitalist form of production cuts off the lifeblood of small-scale agricultural production; this small-scale production is irresistibly dying out and declining." Engels analyzed the status of several strata of peasants—small peasants (poor peasants, including not-so-wealthy middle peasants), middle peasants (relatively wealthy peasants), and large peasants (rich peasants)—based on the ownership of the means of production, business operations, and exploitation relationships. He believed that "small peasants, like any remnants of outdated modes of production, are inevitably heading towards extinction," and that "large peasants have completely maintained and even expanded their old fields. Where middle peasants live among small peasants, in terms of their interests and views, middle peasants are not fundamentally different from small peasants." The masses of peasants, mainly small peasants, to get rid of this situation, the only way is to carry out the struggle to overthrow capitalist rule under the leadership of the proletariat. "Only the downfall of capital can raise the peasants, only the anti-capitalist government of the proletariat, can break the economic poverty and social decline of the peasants." It can be seen that the realization of agricultural cooperativization proposed by Engels is premised on the proletariat seizing power. Without this premise, any plan to realize agricultural cooperativization under capitalist rule is a utopian dream of petty-bourgeois socialism.

　　After the proletariat seizes power, if capitalism is not eliminated, and capitalism is allowed to develop, or in other words, if the capitalist road is taken, can most peasants get rid of their poverty? Is their liberation possible? Engels said that peasants would inevitably go bankrupt under the capitalist form of production. This statement is applicable not only before the rule of the bourgeoisie is overthrown, but also after the rule of the bourgeoisie is overthrown. "We do not need to wait for this change to reach the point where capitalist production has developed to the extreme everywhere, to the point where the last small handicraftsman and the last small peasant have become victims of large-scale capitalist production." Engels meant that as long as capitalist ownership exists, the bankruptcy of most peasants is inevitable. Even if the working class holds power, if capitalism is allowed to develop, small peasants will still become victims of capitalist production. Because scattered and small individual economies can never defeat the economically powerful capitalist economy, and the economy of poor peasants can never defeat the economy of rich peasants. In addition, the peasant individual economy itself is generating capitalism and the bourgeoisie every day, every hour, spontaneously, and in large numbers. Obviously, the road of developing capitalism is the road to the bankruptcy of peasants, and the working-class party can never lead peasants on this road to extinction.

　　If we cannot take the road of developing capitalism, can we take the road of preserving individual operations? The land program passed by the French Socialist Party Congress in 1892 advocated taking this road, and Engels resolutely refuted this road in "The Peasant Question in France and Germany." Based on the erroneous premise that producers can only be free when they control the means of production, and that separating private property from labor will cause the enslavement and poverty of proletarianized laborers, the program made the absurd conclusion that "the principle of socialism includes protecting the private property of small peasants from extinction under the capitalist mode of production." Engels mercilessly refuted this view that violated the principles of socialism, saying: "The ownership of the means of production by individual producers no longer gives them genuine freedom in our time. Handicraft industry in cities has gone bankrupt, and in large cities like London, it has even disappeared completely, replaced by large-scale industry, the sweat system, and pitiful quackery; for quackery, bankruptcy is the source of survival. Small peasants who live by labor are neither guaranteed their own small plots of land nor free. Like himself, his house, his yard, and his fields belong to usurers; his survival is more desperate than the survival of proletarians, who at least sometimes can get a peaceful day, but for slaves who are painfully burdened by debt, this is completely impossible. ... If you guarantee by law that the peasant's farm implements, livestock, etc., cannot be transferred, but when he 'voluntarily' sells his livestock, his person, body, and soul to the usurer in order to get a moment's respite, you still cannot extricate him from his hopeless situation. Your attempt to protect small peasants from their private property is not to protect their freedom, but merely to protect a special form of their slavery; it is to prolong their situation of not being able to survive or die." "If we give a promise to give peasants even a little excuse to speculate that we mean to maintain small land ownership for a long time, then this would be the worst possible disservice not only to the party but also to the small peasants themselves"; "If we could do this, then we would go back to a system from which the existing system will inevitably redevelop. We have not liberated the peasants, but only delayed their demise for a short time." Here, Engels sharply criticized the extremely wrong view of advocating the preservation of small-peasant private ownership, that is, preserving the small-peasant economy, because this view violates the principle of realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. We know that socialism is to eliminate classes and eliminate exploitation, and to eliminate classes and eliminate exploitation, we must first eliminate the individual ownership of the means of production, not only to eliminate the individual ownership of the landlord class and the bourgeoisie, but also to eliminate the individual ownership of small producers. The root cause of the poverty and bankruptcy of small peasants is not that they individually own less means of production (if they own more means of production, then they will become rich peasants who exploit others), but the individual ownership itself. Advocating the protection of the ownership of individual peasants or the preservation of the small-peasant economy is "protecting their slave status," is leading to capitalism, because the more the small-peasant economy is preserved, the more capitalism is promoted, that is, in the sharp struggle between socialism and capitalism, it is not helping socialism, but helping capitalism, and leading the cause of socialism to failure, which is what Engels called "disservice." It can be seen that the working-class party can never lead peasants on the road of preserving the individual economy, and the road of preserving the individual economy, in the final analysis, is the road of developing capitalism.

　　Engels opposed protecting the ownership of individual peasants, does this mean that he advocated expropriating peasants and small private owners after the victory of the proletarian revolution? Definitely not. As early as the "Communist Manifesto," Marx and Engels said: "To transform capital into collective property owned by all members of society is not to transform personal property into social property." After the proletariat seizes power, it first expropriates capital in industry and turns the means of production in industry into the property of the whole people, and also expropriates large landholders. Engels made it clear in "The Peasant Question in France and Germany": "As soon as our party has state power, it should simply expropriate the large landholders, just like expropriating the factory owners." Should small peasants be expropriated? Engels gave a categorical answer to this question: "First, the following proposition of the French program is completely correct, namely, we foresee that small peasants will inevitably perish, but we should in no way accelerate this demise by our intervention. Second, it is equally obvious that when we have state power, we cannot at all conceive of expropriating small peasants by violence (whether or not there is compensation is irrelevant), as we have to do with large landholders." Not only can small peasants not be expropriated at all, but "we will probably also refuse to carry out violent expropriation" of middle peasants. According to Engels's analysis, at that time in France and Germany, "where middle peasants live among small peasants, in terms of their interests and views, middle peasants are not fundamentally different from small peasants; his own experience should tell him: how many people like him have already descended into small peasants." It is an "absurd and criminal road" for the proletariat to expropriate small and medium producers in the countryside after seizing power, "because such a road would destroy any possibility of the victory of the proletarian revolution and would throw the peasants permanently into the camp of the enemies of the proletariat."

　　Since the capitalist road is the road to the bankruptcy of the peasant masses, preserving the ownership of individual peasants is still, in the final analysis, taking the capitalist road, and expropriating small and medium producers in the countryside is an absurd and criminal road, then what road should the working-class party lead the majority of peasants on after seizing power? What kind of policy should be adopted to enable peasants to get rid of poverty and move towards a prosperous and happy life?

　　As early as 1872, Engels put forward the superiority of large-scale agricultural economies based on the principle of combination, saying that "the large land ownership that still exists today will provide us with a good foundation for workers in combinations to start operating large-scale agriculture, and only on this huge scale can all modern auxiliary tools, machines, etc., be applied, thereby making small peasants clearly see the superiority of large economies based on the principle of combination." In a letter to Bebel in 1886, he said: "When transitioning to a communist economy, we must adopt cooperative production as a transitional link. Both Marx and I are firmly convinced of this." When Engels criticized the French Socialist Party's land program for wanting to "protect the private property of small peasants from extinction under the capitalist mode of production," he clearly put forward the principle of the socialist transformation of agriculture, saying, "The task of socialism is only to transfer the means of production to the collective ownership of the producers," and that "the material and spiritual preconditions for the form of collective ownership have been created by the development of capitalist society itself. ... We must use all means of the proletariat to fight for the transfer of the means of production to collective ownership," "The collective ownership of the means of production is put forward as the only main goal that must be strived for. This is true not only in industry where the foundation has been laid, but also everywhere, that is, in agriculture as well." Regarding the transformation of the small-peasant economy, Engels here proposed the issue of agricultural cooperatives, that is, agricultural cooperativization. After emphasizing that "when we have state power, we cannot at all conceive of expropriating small peasants by violence," he went on to say, "Our task for small peasants is first to transform their private production and private ownership into cooperative production and cooperative ownership, but not by using coercive means, but by providing examples and suggesting social assistance to achieve this goal. At that time, we will certainly have enough resources to make small peasants understand the benefits that they should have understood now." "The main problem here is to make peasants clearly see that the only way to save and maintain their estates and land ownership is to turn them into cooperative ownership and cooperative production. It is precisely the individual economy restricted by individual ownership that leads peasants to extinction. If they insist on their individual economy, they will inevitably lose their land and estates, and large-scale capitalist economies will squeeze out their outdated modes of production. That's how things are. So let's provide peasants with the possibility of carrying out large-scale operations themselves, not for the benefit of capital, but for their own common benefit. Can't we make peasants clearly see that this is for their own benefit, that this is their only way to salvation?" In this way, the fundamental problem of how the working class leads peasants to socialism in capitalist countries and backward countries where small producers such as peasants account for the majority of the population is solved. The road pointed out by Engels is: 1. Unite the laboring peasants and all small producers to carry out the revolutionary struggle to overthrow the bourgeoisie and seize power; 2. Expropriate factory owners in industry and large landholders in agriculture; 3. Gradually unite peasants into production cooperatives, gradually transform individual ownership into collective ownership, and gradually transform into large-scale operations using machines with the help of the state, and thus move towards socialist communism step by step. Such a road is the only road to liberate peasants.

  Basic Policies and Principles of Agricultural Cooperativization
　　Engels not only pointed out the direction and purpose of agricultural cooperativization, but also suggested the basic policies and principles for implementing agricultural cooperativization. Although Engels did not have the practice of the proletarian revolution after its victory at that time for reference, he had already suggested a series of key policy issues in the agricultural cooperativization issue based on a profound analysis of the laws of social development and the peasant question. Engels believed that to implement agricultural cooperativization, there must first be a firm class policy.

　　Based on the class analysis of the rural population, Engels put forward the class policy that the working-class party should have towards rural residents. In addition to encouraging and uniting agricultural workers to "fight for their rights," he believed that among peasants, small peasants were the force that the working-class party should firmly unite with. When formulating policies towards peasants, the party should start from the interests of small peasants. Engels said: "Among all peasants, the small peasant type is the most important, and not only for Western Europe in general. No, for the entire issue, the center of gravity is precisely on this type of peasant. As long as we clarify our attitude towards small peasants, we have all the foothold to determine our attitude towards other components of rural residents," and emphatically pointed out that "we are firmly standing on the side of small peasants; we will do everything possible to make their fate better." Because small peasants are the majority of the rural population, and their poor economic status, "his survival is more desperate than the survival of proletarians," which determines that they are the rural class force that is most easily receptive to socialist propaganda and socialist transformation. If the working-class party does not focus on small peasants and does not get the support of these basic peasant masses, any socialist transformation cause is impossible to achieve. Engels took an extremely firm attitude towards purifying the party's organization, believing that "there can be individual figures from any social class in our party, but in any case, we do not need any group of capitalists, middle bourgeoisie, or middle peasants who are linked by common interests." A firm class policy: relying on whom, uniting with whom, opposing whom, and for a certain purpose, on a certain issue, working hand in hand with what group without harming the party's political and organizational principles at any time—this is the guarantee of the party's victory in realizing socialist transformation as instructed by Engels.

　　Secondly, repeated socialist propaganda should be carried out among peasants, and peasants should be persuaded with examples of agricultural cooperatives to make them believe in the superiority of large-scale cooperative economies. Of course, the road of agricultural cooperativization is the road to saving peasants from bankruptcy and making peasants jointly prosperous. However, this truth is not easily accepted by most peasants until they have thoroughly understood it. As laborers, peasants tend towards socialism, but as private owners, peasants tend towards capitalism. Engels not only estimated the positive side of peasants, but also estimated their negative side. "As small peasants who are predecessors of proletarians, they should be willing to listen to socialist propaganda. But deeply rooted private concepts sometimes prevent him from doing this. The harder he struggles to maintain his small plot of land that is full of crisis, the more stubborn and desperate he is to hold on to this small plot of land, and the more he tends to regard social democrats who tell him to transfer land property to the entire society as dangerous enemies like usurers and lawyers." The reason why Engels made such an estimate was to explain that socialist propaganda must be carried out repeatedly among peasants to raise their political awareness and turn socialist ideas into their ideas. Only in this way can agricultural cooperativization be successfully realized. Engels taught us that "it is the duty of our party to explain to peasants anytime and anywhere that as long as capitalism still rules, their situation is completely hopeless, they can absolutely not maintain their small land ownership, and they should absolutely believe that large-scale capitalist production will crush their weak and outdated small production, just like trains on railways crush wheelbarrows." But at the same time, he firmly opposed saying empty words to peasants and making promises that could not be fulfilled. "Our interest is definitely not to attract peasants to our side today, so that when we cannot fulfill our promises, they will leave us again tomorrow." Engels emphasized that using examples for propaganda is the most effective way to enlighten peasants and raise their awareness. "These examples of agricultural cooperatives will convince the last resisting small peasants," making them "believe in the superiority of large-scale cooperative economies."

　　Again, the principle of voluntary mutual benefit must be observed. The voluntary principle of agricultural cooperatives is that "coercive means must never be used," and that "if they are determined, make it easy for them to transition to cooperatives, and if they are not yet determined, give them some time to consider on their small plots of land," and that "economic development will cleanse the minds of peasants and make them understand what we are talking about." The voluntary principle is based on the peasants' awareness. If they understand the benefits of cooperatives and are willing to join, let them join. If they do not yet understand, let them consider, and then join after they have considered. Coercive means must never be taken against peasants. Forcing peasants to join cooperatives is fundamentally contrary to the voluntary principle. Voluntariness is based on mutual benefit. Regarding this point, Engels also gave principled instructions: "The income obtained should be distributed proportionally according to the amount of land placed, the amount of capital invested, and the amount of labor contributed," and that "the rights and obligations of the entire cooperative and its individual personnel should be placed on an equal footing with the rights and obligations of other parts of the entire group." This means that production and distribution must be done well. When the products of the cooperative increase and the income of the members increases, peasants outside the cooperative will voluntarily and actively join the cooperative.

　　Finally, Engels also pointed out the importance of the state providing assistance to cooperatives: "Either allocate land from neighboring large estates to peasant cooperatives, or give them the resources and possibilities to carry out sideline work, even if mainly for their own consumption. In both cases, they will be in a better economic position, and this will at the same time ensure that the central social regime has the necessary influence to gradually transform agricultural cooperatives into higher forms... As for how to specifically realize this in each individual case, that will depend on the circumstances of this occasion and on the circumstances under which we are able to seize power. Perhaps we will be able to provide these cooperatives with more benefits: the state bank will accept all their mortgaged debts and greatly reduce their interest rates; subsidies will be drawn from public funds to help establish large-scale production (subsidies are not necessarily or only limited to money, but can also be necessities: machines, artificial fertilizers, etc.), and there are other benefits." Here, not only is the state's assistance mentioned, but also the steps for agricultural cooperatives to gradually transition to higher forms. Equally important, Engels, in order not to bind the hands and feet of future Marxist parties, pointed out that problems should be solved specifically according to specific occasions, which is also very important. Engels's brilliant ideas on agricultural cooperativization have become the guiding principles for the working-class parties of various countries in realizing the socialist transformation of agriculture. Lenin developed Engels's theory on agricultural cooperativization and creatively formulated a cooperative plan for building socialism based on the specific situation after the working class seized power. Stalin further developed Engels's principles of agricultural cooperativization after Lenin. The practice of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries fully proves that the road of agricultural cooperativization, which was laid by Engels and opened up by Lenin, "for all capitalist countries with a considerable number of small and medium producer classes, this road of development is the only possible and appropriate road for socialism to win victory." Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the resolution passed by the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China based on this report, are precisely the concrete realization of the principles of agricultural cooperativization of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin through Comrade Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China in China with 600 million people. Today, the rural areas of China, which account for one-fifth of the world's population, have set off a high tide of socialist mass movement that is unprecedented in scale. The rural areas with a population of more than 500 million are about to "gradually realize the socialist industrialization and gradually realize the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce, and at the same time, gradually realize the socialist transformation of the entire agriculture, that is, implement cooperation, eliminate the rich peasant economic system and the individual economic system in the rural areas, and make all rural people jointly prosperous." This will be another great victory for the Chinese people, and also another confirmation of the correctness of Engels's brilliant ideas. (Attached picture)

    恩格斯论农业合作化
　　——纪念恩格斯诞生一百三十五周年
　　陈昌浩
    科学社会主义的创始人马克思、恩格斯，根据对资本主义社会的科学分析，不仅证明资本主义制度必然灭亡而过渡到没有人剥削人的现象的社会主义社会，而且证明无产阶级有可能、有必要团结一切被剥削的劳动群众，主要是农民群众，来进行推翻资本主义制度和建设社会主义社会的革命斗争。马克思、恩格斯从无产阶级解放事业的利益出发，把农民看成是“人口、生产和政治力量的非常重要的要素”，把农民问题看成是无产阶级的同盟者问题，认为在无产阶级革命胜利以前，发生农民反剥削反压迫的斗争，无产阶级革命就得到了合唱，“没有这种合唱，则它在一切农民国家中的独唱就会变成孤鸣”，因此无产阶级必须联合劳动农民为推翻资产阶级的政权而斗争；在取得政权之后，工人阶级为了巩固革命政权，为了建设社会主义，必须吸引广大农民群众参加社会主义改造事业。“我们能使之不真正转变为无产者而把他们仍然作为农民吸收到我们这方面来的农民人数愈多，社会变革的进行也就愈加迅速和愈加容易。”科学社会主义创始人制定的无产阶级革命的理论和策略中，包括有无产阶级领导农民进行革命斗争的理论和策略，而在农民问题方面，作为在马克思去世后“整个文明世界最卓越的学者和无产阶级的导师”的恩格斯，也是有极伟大的贡献的。他不仅发挥了马克思关于在资本主义制度下农民必然破产、农民是无产阶级的天然同盟者、无产阶级必须团结劳动农民来夺取政权的理论和策略，而且创造性地提出了在无产阶级革命胜利后为了使生产关系适合于生产力的发展就必须改造小农经济，必须实行农业合作化的问题。恩格斯关于农业合作化的天才思想集中地体现在他一八九四年写的“法德农民问题”中。虽然这一思想首先是无产阶级政党在夺取政权之前吸引广大农民参加革命斗争的纲领，但同时它也是无产阶级政党在取得政权之后引导广大农民走向社会主义的纲领。今天，当我国社会主义农业合作化运动高潮已经来到的时候，我们来认真地学习恩格斯关于农业合作化问题的原理，是非常必要的。
　  农业合作化道路是使农民获得解放的唯一道路
    恩格斯具体地分析了西方国家，首先是法德两国农村人口的情形，认为在这样的小农经济占优势的国家中，只要资本主义生产形式存在，小农经济是必遭破产，大多数农民是必濒于灭亡的。因为这种建立在个人私有制基础上的小农经济的特点是分散经营、技术落后、商品生产率极低，不仅不能实现扩大的再生产，就连实现简单的再生产也不可能，租税、歉收、高利贷的压迫，使“他们的处境每况愈下”；而资本主义发展的经济规律：大经济排挤小经济，大生产压倒小生产，就必然使农村中的个体经营毁灭下去，使广大农民急剧地破产。“资本主义生产形式的发展，割断了农业小生产的命脉；这种小生产不可抑制地在灭亡着和衰落着。”恩格斯根据生产资料的占有、经营情况、剥削关系分析了农民中几个阶层——小农（贫苦农民，包括不富裕的中农）、中等农民（较富裕的农民）、大农（富农）的地位，认为“小农，正如任何过了时的生产方式的残余一样，不可避免地走向着灭亡”，“大农完整地保持了并且甚至扩大了自己旧有的田地。在中等农民居住于小农中间的地方，按其利益和观点讲来，中等农民是跟小农没有什么根本不同的”。农民群众，主要是小农，要摆脱这种情况，唯一的办法是在无产阶级的领导下进行推翻资本统治的斗争。“只有资本的倒台才能提高农民，只有无产阶级的反资本主义的政府，才能打破农民经济上的贫困和社会上的低落”可见恩格斯提出的农业合作化的实现是以无产阶级夺取政权为前提的，没有这一前提，任何想在资本主义统治下实现农业合作化的计划，都是小资产阶级社会主义的空想。
    究竟在无产阶级夺取政权以后，如果不消灭资本主义，让资本主义发展下去，或者说走资本主义的道路，大多数农民是否能摆脱自己的贫困地位呢？他们的解放是否可能呢？恩格斯说在资本主义生产形式下农民必然破产，这句话不仅在资产阶级的统治被推翻以前适用，在资产阶级的统治被推翻以后也是适用的。“我们无须等待这一变革到资本主义生产到处都发展到极点的时候，到最后的小手工业者和最后的小农都变成大规模资本主义生产的牺牲品的时候。”恩格斯这段话的意思是说，只要资本主义的所有制存在，大多数农民的破产是必不可免的；即使是工人阶级掌握政权，如果让资本主义发展下去，小农还是会成为资本主义生产的牺牲品的。因为零星细小的个体经济总是敌不过经济力量雄厚的资本主义经济，贫苦农民的经济总是敌不过富农的经济的。加之，农民个体经济本身就在每天每时地、自发地、大批地在产生着资本主义和资产阶级。很显然的，发展资本主义的道路是使农民破产的道路，工人阶级的政党是决不能领导农民走这条灭亡的道路的。
    不能走发展资本主义的道路，可不可以走保存个体经营的道路呢？一八九二年法国社会党代表大会通过的土地纲领上正是主张走这样的道路，而恩格斯在“法德农民问题”中所坚决驳斥的，也就是这条道路。纲领上根据生产者只有掌握生产资料时才能自由；把私有财产和劳动分隔开来，就会引起无产化了的劳动者的奴役和贫困的错误前提，作出了“社会主义的原则是包括着保护小农私有财产免于在资本主义生产方式下的灭亡”的荒谬结论。恩格斯无情地驳斥了这种违反社会主义原则的观点，他说：“生产资料之属于个别生产者所有，在我们的时代已经不赋予他们以真正的自由。城市中的手工业已经破产，而在像伦敦那样的大城市里则甚至全然绝迹，起而代之的是大规模工业、血汗制度和可怜的江湖骗子；对于江湖骗子讲来，破产正是生存的泉源。以劳动为生的小农既未被保证有自己的小块土地，也不自由。正如他自己一样，他的房屋、他的院子、他的田地都属于高利贷者；他的生存较之无产者的生存更加绝望，无产者至少有时还能获得平安的一日，而对于被债务压得痛苦不堪的奴隶，这却是完全没有的事。……试依据法律保证农民的农具、牲畜等等不得让渡，然而当他为了获得瞬间的喘息‘自愿地’将自己的牲口，将他本人、肉体和灵魂一并出卖给高利贷者的时候，你们是仍旧无法将他从走头无路的处境中解脱出来的。你们企图从其私有财产中保护小农，这不是保护他的自由，而仅仅是保护他的奴隶身份的特殊形式而已；这是延长他的求生不成求死不得的状况”。“如果我们给予诺言使农民哪怕有一点借口去推想我们的意思是指长期保持零细土地所有制，那末这不仅对于党而且对于小农自己也是最坏不过的倒帮忙”；“假使我们能够这样做，那末我们便回到这样的一个制度去，从它里面将不可避免地重新发展出现有的制度。我们并没有解放农民，而只是把他们的灭亡缓延了一个短时间。”恩格斯在这里尖锐地批判了主张保留小农私有制，即保留小农经济的极端错误的观点，因为这种观点是违反了对农业实现社会主义改造的原则的。我们知道，社会主义就是消灭阶级，消灭剥削，而消灭阶级、消灭剥削就首先要消灭生产资料的个人所有制，不仅要消灭地主阶级、资产阶级的个人所有制，而且要消灭小生产者的个人所有制。小农贫困破产的根源并不是他个人占有的生产资料少（如果他占有的生产资料多，那他就会变成剥削别人的富农），而是个人所有制本身。主张保护个体农民的所有制或保留小农经济，这是“保护他的奴隶身份”，是导向资本主义，因为越保留小农经济，就越助长资本主义，也就是说，在社会主义和资本主义的尖锐斗争中，不是帮助社会主义，而是帮助资本主义，把社会主义事业引向失败，这也就是恩格斯所说的
  “倒帮忙”。可见，工人阶级的政党决不能领导农民走保留个体经济的道路，而保留个体经济的道路，归根到底，是发展资本主义的道路。
    恩格斯反对保护个体农民所有制，这是否意味着他主张在无产阶级革命胜利后剥夺农民、剥夺小私有者呢？决不是的。还在“共产党宣言”上，马克思、恩格斯就说过：“变资本为社会全体成员所有的集体财产，这并不是变个人财产为社会财产。”无产阶级在取得政权后，首先剥夺工业中的资本，把工业中的生产资料收归全民所有，对于大土地占有者也实行剥夺。恩格斯在“法德农民问题”中说得很清楚：“我们的党一掌握了国家政权，它就应该干脆地剥夺大土地占有者，就像剥夺工业厂主一样。”究竟对小农是否实行剥夺呢？恩格斯对这个问题作了斩钉截铁的回答：“第一，法国纲领的下列命题是完全正确的，即我们预见到小农不可避免地要灭亡，但我们无论如何不应该以自己的干涉去加速这种灭亡。第二，同样地显而易见，当我们掌握了国家政权的时候，我们根本不能设想用暴力去剥夺小农
  （有无赔偿是无关紧要的），就像我们对于大土地占有者所不得不作的一样。”不仅对于小农根本不能实行剥夺，就是对于中等农民“我们大概也将拒绝实行暴力的剥夺”。根据恩格斯的分析，当时在法德两国，“在中等农民居住于小农中间的地方，按其利益和观点讲来，中等农民是跟小农没有什么根本不同的；他本身的经验应该告诉他：有多少类似他这样的人已经下降为小农了。”无产者取得政权后，剥夺农村中的中小生产者，这是“荒谬和犯罪的道路，因为这样的道路就会摧毁无产阶级革命胜利的任何可能性，就会把农民长久地抛掷到无产阶级敌人的阵营中”。
    既然资本主义的道路是使农民群众破产的道路，保留个体农民所有制归根结蒂还是走资本主义的道路，而剥夺农村的中小生产者则是荒谬和犯罪的道路，那末，工人阶级的政党在取得政权后，究竟应该领导大多数农民走什么道路呢？应该采取什么样的方针，才能使农民解脱贫困走向繁荣幸福的生活呢？
    恩格斯还在一八七二年就提出了基于组合原则的大农业经济的优越性，说“现在还存在着的大土地所有制将供给我们以良好基础来由组合工作者着手经营大规模的农业，只有在这种巨大规模下，才能应用一切现代辅助工具、机器等等，从而使小农明显地看到基于组合原则的大经济的优越性”。他在一八八六年给倍倍尔的信上说：“当过渡到共产主义经济的时候，我们必须采用合作社的生产作为过渡的环节，关于这一点，我和马克思两人都是确信无疑的。”恩格斯在批评法国社会党土地纲领中要
  “保护小农私有财产免于在资本主义生产方式下的灭亡”的时候，就明白地提出了农业社会主义改造的原则，他说“社会主义的任务仅仅在于把生产资料转交给生产者集体占有”，集体掌握形式的“物质的和精神的前提已经被资本主义社会的发展本身所造成了……必须以无产阶级所有的一切办法来为生产资料之转到集体占有而斗争”“生产资料之集体占有被提出来作为必须争取的唯一的主要目标。这不仅在基础已经打好了的工业方面是如此，而且在所有的地方，也就是说，在农业方面也是如此。”对于小农经济的改造，恩格斯在这里提出了农业合作社，即农业合作化的问题，他在强调“当我们掌握了国家政权的时候，我们根本不能设想用暴力去剥夺小农”之后，接着就说，“我们对于小农的任务首先是在于：将其私人的生产和私人的所有权变为合作社的生产和合作社的所有权，但决不是使用强迫的手段，而是凭借提供范例和建议社会帮助以达到这一目的。那时候我们当然会有足够的资力，使小农懂得他们现在本来就应该懂得的好处。”“这里主要的问题在于使农民明白地看到：要想挽救和保持他们的庄园和土地所有权，便只有把它们变成合作社的所有权和合作社的生产。正是被个人占有所制约着的个体经济把农民导向灭亡。如果他们坚持自己的个体经济，那末他们不可避免地将丧失土地和庄园，大规模的资本主义经济将排挤他们陈旧的生产方式。事情就是如此。所以我们就来提供农民以自己进行大规模经营的可能性，不是为了资本的利益，而是为了他们自己的共同利益。难道不能使农民明白地看到：这就是为了他们自己的利益，这就是他们的唯一得救的途径吗？”这样，也就解决了在农民等小生产者占人口多数的资本主义国家和落后国家中工人阶级如何领导他们走向社会主义这样的一个根本问题。恩格斯所指明的道路是：一、联合劳动农民及一切小生产者进行推翻资产阶级的革命斗争，夺取政权；二、剥夺工业厂主，剥夺农业中大土地占有者；三、逐步地把农民联合到生产合作社中，逐步地变个人所有制为集体所有制，在国家的帮助下，逐步地转为使用机器的大规模的经营，这样一步一步地走向社会主义共产主义。这样的道路就是使农民获得解放的唯一道路。
  农业合作化的基本政策和原则
    恩格斯不仅指出了农业合作化的方针、目的，而且提示了实行农业合作化的基本政策和原则。虽然恩格斯在当时还没有无产阶级革命胜利后的实践可供参考，但是他根据对社会发展规律和对农民问题的深刻分析，已经提示了农业合作化问题中一系列关于政策方面的关键性的问题。恩格斯认为要实行农业合作化，首先要有坚定的阶级政策。
    恩格斯根据对农村人口的阶级分析，提出了工人阶级政党对农村居民应有的阶级政策。除了必须鼓舞、团结农业工人去“为自己的权利而斗争”外，他认为在农民中间，小农是工人阶级政党所应该坚决联合的力量。党在制定对农民的政策时，要以小农的利益为出发点。恩格斯说：“在所有的农民当中，小农这一类型是最重要的，而且不仅仅对于一般西欧才是如此。不，对于整个问题说来，重心正是在这一类型的农民身上。只要我们搞清楚了我们对小农的态度，我们便有了确定我们对乡村居民其他组成部分的态度的一切立足点”，并且强调地指出，“我们是坚决地站在小农方面的；我们将尽一切可能使他们的命运较好些”。因为小农是农村人口的多数，他们的贫苦的经济地位，“他的生存较之无产者的生存更加绝望”，这就决定了他们是最容易接受社会主义宣传和社会主义改造的农村阶级力量。如果工人阶级政党不把重心放在小农身上，得不到这些基本农民群众的支持，任何社会主义改造事业都是不可能实现的。恩格斯对于纯洁党的组织这点，采取极坚决的态度，认为“在我们党内可以有来自任何社会阶级的个别人物，但是任何为共同利益所联系起来的资本家、中等资产阶级或中等农民的集团，无论如何我们是不需要的。”坚定的阶级政策：依靠谁，联合谁，反对谁，为了一定的目的，在一定问题上，可以和什么集团携手奋斗，任何时候也不损害党的政治、组织原则，这就是恩格斯所指示的党在实现社会主义改造中取得胜利的保证。
    其次，要反复地向农民进行社会主义宣传，用农业合作社的范例说服农民，使他们相信大规模合作社经济的优越性。固然，农业合作化的道路是挽救农民免于破产、使农民共同富裕的道路。但是，这番道理在大多数农民没有彻底了解以前，是不容易被他们接受的。作为劳动者，农民是倾向于社会主义的，但是作为私有者，农民是倾向于资本主义的。恩格斯不仅估计到农民积极的一面，也估计到他们的消极的一面。“作为无产者前身的小农，本来应当乐意地倾听社会主义的宣传。但是根深蒂固的私有观念，有时候还阻碍他做到这一点。他之为保持他那一小块危机四伏的土地的斗争愈加艰苦，他便愈加顽固和拚命地守着这一小块土地不放，他便愈加倾向于把那些告诉他将土地财产转交给整个社会掌握的社会民主党人看作如同高利贷者和律师一样危险的敌人。”恩格斯之所以作出这样的估计，是为了要说明：必须在农民中反复地进行社会主义的宣传，以提高农民的政治觉悟，使社会主义的思想变成他们的思想。只有这样，农业合作化才能顺利实现。恩格斯教导我们说：“我们党的职责是随时随地向农民解释：只要资本主义还统治着，他们的处境便完全绝望，他们便绝对不可能保持他们那样的零细土地所有制，他们应绝对相信资本主义的大规模生产将压碎他们的无力的过时的小生产，正如铁路上的火车压碎独轮手推车一样。”但在同时，他坚决反对向农民说空话，作出不兑现的诺言，“我们的利益决不在于今天就把农民吸引到自己这方面来，以便当我们不能实现自己的诺言时，让他们明天再离开我们。”恩格斯强调用范例来进行宣传是启发农民、提高农民觉悟最有效的办法。
  “这些农业合作社的范例将说服最后反抗的零细农民”，使他们“相信大规模合作社经济的优越处”。
    再次，要遵守自愿互利的原则。农业合作社的自愿原则就是“决不是使用强迫手段”，“如果他们下决心的话，就使他们易于过渡到合作社，如果他们还下不了决心的话，就给他们一些时间，让他们在自己的零细土地上考虑一下”，“经济发展则会清洗农民的头脑，使之了解我们所讲的话”。自愿原则是建筑在农民自觉的基础上的。他们了解到合作社的好处，愿意加入，就让他们加入。如果还不了解，就让他们考虑，等到考虑好了，再加入合作社。决不能对农民采取强迫手段。强迫农民加入合作社是根本违反自愿原则的。自愿又是建立在互利的基础上的。关于这点，恩格斯也作了原则上的指示：“将获得的收入根据所置田地、所投资金及所出劳力的多寡按比例分配”，“使整个合作社及其各别人员的权利和义务与整个集团其他各部分的权利和义务处于平等的地位。”这就是说，要搞好生产和分配。合作社的产品增加了，社员的收入增加了，社外农民就会自愿地积极地加入合作社。
    最后，恩格斯还指出了国家对合作社给予帮助的重要性：“或是从邻近的大领地中拨出田地给农民合作社，或是给他们以资力和可能性去进行副业工作，哪怕主要是为了他们自己的消费。在这两种情况下，他们都将处于较好的经济地位，并且这将同时保证中央社会政权具有必要的影响，逐渐把农业合作社转变为更高级的形式……至于怎样具体地在每一个别场合下将这一点实现出来，那将决定于这一场合的情形如何，并且决定于我们得以夺取政权的那些情况如何。可能我们这样便能够给这些合作社提供更多的裨益：由国家银行收受它们的一切抵押的债项并将其利息大大减轻；从公共资金中抽拨补助金以帮助建立大规模生产（补助金不一定或者不只是限于金钱，而且可以是必需品：机器、人工肥料等等），还有其他的裨益。”这里不仅提到了国家的帮助，还提到农业合作社逐渐转到更高级形式的步骤。同样重要的，恩格斯为了不束缚未来马克思主义政党的手脚，指出要根据具体场合来具体解决问题，这点也是很重要的。恩格斯关于农业合作化问题的天才思想已成为各国工人阶级政党在实现农业的社会主义改造时的指导原则。列宁发展了恩格斯关于农业合作化的理论，根据工人阶级取得政权后的具体情况创造性地制定了建设社会主义的合作社计划。斯大林继列宁之后又进一步地发挥了恩格斯的农业合作化的原理。苏联、各人民民主国家的实践充分地证明了农业合作化这条为恩格斯所奠定而为列宁所开辟的道路，“对于一切具有人数相当众多的中小生产者阶级的资本主义国家，这条发展道路是使社会主义获得胜利的唯一可能的和适当的道路”。毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党七届六中全会扩大会议根据这一报告所通过的决议，正是马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的农业合作化原理通过毛泽东同志和中国共产党在六亿人的中国的具体实现。今天，占全世界五分之一的人口的中国农村已经掀起了按规模说来是史无前例的社会主义群众运动的高潮，五亿多人口的农村，就要“在逐步地实现社会主义工业化和逐步地实现对于手工业、对于资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的同时，逐步地实现对于整个农业的社会主义改造，即实行合作化，在农村中消灭富农经济制度和个体经济制度，使全体农村人民共同富裕起来”。这将是中国人民的又一次伟大胜利，也是恩格斯天才思想的正确性又一次得到证实。（附图片）
