    Approval of "Spontaneous Cooperatives"
    In the past, some regions had set their plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives too low, failing to meet the demands of farmers to join and establish cooperatives. As a result, a large number of "spontaneous cooperatives" emerged. In the past year alone, farmers in Fujian Province organized more than 1,600 "spontaneous cooperatives."
    According to investigations in various parts of Fujian, about 80% of these cooperatives are well-run; with strengthened leadership, the vast majority can be consolidated. How should these "spontaneous cooperatives" be treated? Party organizations in various parts of Fujian have adopted a positive leadership attitude and measures, analyzing and studying the situation of these "spontaneous cooperatives." Now, with the exception of a small number of fake cooperatives run by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries, all "spontaneous cooperatives" have been approved. In the future, these cooperatives will be treated in the same way as ordinary cooperatives. After hearing the news of the approval, the members of these cooperatives were overjoyed and their enthusiasm for production was even higher. What should be done with those fake cooperatives run by landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries? They must be resolutely disbanded. Some farmers in these fake cooperatives may have genuinely joined and been deceived; they should be helped to organize other cooperatives or join other cooperatives.

    批准“自发社”
    过去一个时期，有不少地区发展农业生产合作社的计划定得偏低，不能满足农民入社办社的要求；因此，出现了大量的“自发社”。一年来，福建省各地农民组织的“自发社”就有一千六百多个。
    据福建各地调查，这些合作社，百分之八十左右是办好了的；只要加强领导，绝大部分可以巩固下来。怎样对待这些“自发社”呢？福建省各地党组织采取了积极领导的态度和措施，对这些“自发社”的情况作了分析研究；现在，除了地主、富农、反革命分子所办的少数假社以外，已经批准了所有的“自发社”，今后要用对待一般的合作社完全相同的态度对待这些合作社。这些合作社的社员听到批准的消息以后，欢欣鼓舞，生产情绪更加高涨了。对那些地主、富农、反革命分子办的假社，应该怎么办呢？必须坚决地解散它们。这些假社里，可能有些农民是真心入社而受骗的，应当帮助他们另外组织合作社，或者加入别的合作社。
