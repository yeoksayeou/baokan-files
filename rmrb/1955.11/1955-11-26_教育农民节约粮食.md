　　Educate Peasants to Conserve Grain

　　This year, the whole country celebrates a bumper harvest. However, the state has not only refrained from increasing the amount of agricultural tax grain levied but has also reduced the amount of grain purchased under the unified purchase system. The broad masses of peasants are actively selling surplus grain, joining agricultural cooperatives, and acquiring farm tools, draught animals, and fertilizers to expand agricultural and sideline production this winter and next spring. The countryside is filled with prosperity everywhere. However, it is worth noting that at this time, certain wasteful phenomena have begun to appear.

　　According to reports from many places, there are now many instances of grain waste in rural areas. Many peasants, mainly middle peasants, but also including some poor peasants, are holding extravagant banquets for “weddings and funerals” after the autumn harvest, feeding pigs and chickens with excessive amounts of staple grains, brewing large quantities of liquor and making sugar, and even holding “thanksgiving” ceremonies to gods, and organizing gambling contests. In Miaoshankou Township, Lingling, Hunan, 148 peasant households consumed an average of more than twice as much grain per day after the autumn harvest as they did before. Xie Fugen, a peasant in Fangdian Township, Dantu County, Jiangsu, held more than 30 tables of banquets for his son's wedding, wasting a lot of grain and turning from a surplus grain household into a grain-deficient household. Many peasants in Hailong County, Jilin, want to eat "good rice" and transport large quantities of new rice to private rice mills for processing, with a precision exceeding the national standard for first-class rice. These phenomena of grain waste bring difficulties to many peasants in terms of production and livelihood, and cause great losses to the country; for the sake of the country's interests, for the sake of the peasants' interests, this phenomenon must be eliminated immediately.

　　Peasants who waste grain are not unaware that grain is the most precious thing. But why do they think wrongly? How should we get through to them?

　　Some people think: "This year is a bumper harvest, we should improve our lives!" So they eat and drink extravagantly. Appropriately improving living standards is, of course, perfectly legitimate. The Party and the government lead peasants to run cooperatives and develop agricultural and sideline production, ultimately to improve living standards. Otherwise, who would be willing to work hard from morning till night to produce? However, we must never confuse improving living standards with waste. The basis for improving living standards is developing production. But at present, our country's production level is still very low, and there are often changes in good and bad years, so only by continuously developing production can we gradually and surely improve living standards. If, after a bumper harvest, all the grain is wasted, how can we develop production and continue to improve living standards? Every hardworking and thrifty peasant should consider the long-term interests of the country and himself, and after paying agricultural tax grain and selling surplus grain, plan the family's grain consumption in a planned way. This is the proper way to improve living standards. The examples cited above far exceed this limit, so it is not improving living standards, but wasting. Grain is the fruit of the hard work of the peasants, how can they not cherish the fruits of their labor?

　　The majority of areas that suffered from floods last year should pay more attention to conserving grain after achieving a bumper harvest this year. One of the most important reasons why these areas were able to steadily overcome those serious disasters last year and achieve such a good harvest this year is that the state implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, mastering the grain that can meet the needs of all parties. Whoever wastes grain weakens the strength of himself and the country to defend against disasters. Patriotic peasants will certainly understand this principle.

　　Some people say: "The 'three fixed' policy stipulates that output and purchase volume remain unchanged for three years, and increased production does not increase purchases. I have more and more grain on hand, so what is there to conserve?" This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the significance of the grain "three fixed" policy. The state implements the "three fixed" policy in order to systematize the unified purchase and sale system, encourage peasants to actively produce, support the country's industrial construction, and continuously improve the lives of peasants. If, because the state has implemented the "three fixed" policy, people eat and drink extravagantly and waste grain, then some surplus grain households and self-sufficient households may become grain-deficient households, which will inevitably affect the stability of the state's grain purchase and sale plan and damage the effect of the grain "three fixed" policy. Is this what the peasants of New China should do?

　　Some people say: "It's okay to eat more grain now, the government will supply it!" This idea is even more wrong. After the implementation of the grain "three fixed", the state has reduced the amount of grain purchased, and it is necessary to strictly control grain sales; if sales cannot be controlled, the purchase volume cannot be stabilized. The state has plans for who it supplies grain to, how much it supplies, and when it supplies it, and it is no longer possible or permissible to continue to supply grain beyond the plan. It can be said that whoever wastes grain and asks the state to supply grain is forcing the state to disrupt the grain unified sales plan. This is extremely harmful to the country, and it will not be of any benefit to the peasants!

　　We must not only conduct extensive and in-depth publicity on grain conservation among peasants, but also help peasants make specific plans for grain conservation. The phenomena of grain waste mentioned above are generally not difficult to correct. Because they are too serious, they have long been intolerable to rural public opinion. As long as we further explain the truth clearly, the peasants will correct themselves. However, we must also pay attention to correcting those phenomena of grain waste that are not easily noticed, and the most reliable way to correct these wasteful phenomena is to help peasants formulate daily grain-saving plans. For example, we should encourage peasants to raise chickens and ducks. We cannot stop raising them just to save grain. There are many substitutes for feeding chickens and ducks in rural areas, which can completely achieve the goal of raising more chickens and ducks while saving grain. In order to mobilize peasants to conserve grain, the Chinese Communist Party branch of Daling Township, Hengnan County, Hunan, specifically convened a meeting of mutual aid and cooperation representatives to commend models of grain conservation and criticize the phenomenon of grain waste. The branch helped everyone calculate an account: the township has a total of more than 28,800 chickens and ducks, which regularly consume a lot of grain. If attention is paid to feeding and some substitutes are used, each chicken and duck can save two deciliters of rice per month, and the whole township can save more than 40,000 catties of grain in five months. This figure surprised the peasants present, and people responded to the branch's call and came to formulate monthly grain consumption plans. As a result, everyone "knew what to expect" in their daily lives, and the phenomenon of grain waste was greatly reduced.

　　In order to save grain bit by bit in daily life, we must mobilize the broad masses of rural women. They are responsible for cooking, feeding pigs, raising chickens, and other tasks. The majority of the grain consumed by each family passes through their hands. If they all learn to live frugally and carefully, they will be able to save a lot of grain. Many villages and towns in Hunan and other provinces, where Party branches, agricultural cooperatives, or women's federations convene women's symposiums, promote the significance of grain conservation from a macro perspective, study methods of grain conservation from a micro perspective, and mobilize everyone to pay attention to saving in daily life, have been proven to be very effective.

　　Mobilizing peasants to conserve grain must also fight against backward ideas and habits. However, as long as we truly grasp the ideological situation of the peasants, adopt appropriate methods, and conduct persuasion and education, we can also achieve our goals. In Sanjiecang Village, Tai'an County, Liaoning, three peasant families prepared to slaughter three fat pigs on the first day of the tenth lunar month to worship gods and "fulfill vows" to cure their children's illnesses. Yang Ende, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch, patiently explained the details to these three peasant households, explaining that this practice was a great waste and would delay the illness; if they wanted to cure the illness, they should quickly ask a doctor. The three peasant households listened and found it reasonable, changing the habit of slaughtering pigs to "fulfill vows." The child's illness was cured by the doctor, and 1,500 catties of sorghum rice were saved.

　　Conserving grain is a long-term task for the people of the whole country. With the development of agricultural production, peasants have more and more grain in their hands. We must persuade members of agricultural cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and individual peasants to use and allocate the surplus grain rationally after completing the task of paying agricultural tax grain and selling surplus grain for the sake of the country's interests and their own interests. We should try our best to purchase the means of production and expand production next year, and appropriately improve our lives under this premise. Absolutely do not waste grain and money. Our country's peasants have always been hardworking and thrifty, and abhor extravagance and waste, especially the wasting of grain, which is considered a sin against basic morality. We must educate peasants to carry forward this fine tradition.

　　教育农民节约粮食
    今年全国喜庆丰收，可是国家不但没有增加征收公粮的数量，还减低了统购粮食的数量。广大农民积极出售余粮，参加农业合作社，添置农具、耕畜和肥料，扩大今冬明春的农业生产和副业生产，农村中到处充满了兴旺的气象。但是值得注意的是，在这个时候，某些浪费现象却开始出现了。
    据许多地方报告，目前有不少的农村出现了浪费粮食的现象。有不少农民，主要是中农，也包括一部分贫农，在秋收以后，大摆筵席办“红白事”，用过多的主粮喂猪养鸡，大量烧酒熬糖，甚至迎神
  “还愿”，赛会赌博。湖南零陵庙山口乡一百四十八户农民，秋后每天消费的粮食，平均超过秋收前两倍。江苏丹徒县方殿乡农民谢福根给儿子结婚，摆了三十多桌酒席，浪费许多粮食，由余粮户变成缺粮户。吉林海龙县许多农民想吃“好大米”，把大量新稻运到私营制米厂加工，精度超过国家规定的一等米的标准。这些浪费粮食的现象，给许多农民带来生产和生活上的困难，给国家造成很大的损失；为了国家的利益，为了农民的利益，这种现象必须立即消除。
    浪费粮食的农民，并非不知道粮食是最宝贵的东西。可是他们为什么想错了？应该怎样打通他们的思想呢？
    有人想：“今年大丰收，应该改善改善生活了！”于是大吃大喝起来。适当地改善生活，自然是完全正当的。党和政府领导农民办合作社，发展农业和副业生产，归根到底，都是为了改善生活。否则，谁还肯起早睡晚地努力生产呢？但是，决不能把改善生活同浪费混为一谈。改善生活的基础是发展生产。但目前我国的生产水平还很低，而且年成丰歉常有变化，只有不断地发展生产，才能逐步地有把握地改善生活。如果在丰收以后，都把粮食浪费了，还怎样发展生产，继续改善生活？每一个勤劳俭朴的农民，都应该为国家和自己的长远利益着想，在缴纳公粮、交售余粮以后，有计划地安排家庭的用粮，这才是正当的改善生活。像上面举的那些例子，远远超过这个限度，就不是什么改善生活，而是浪费了。粮食是农民们辛辛苦苦挣来的劳动果实，对于自己的劳动果实，怎么能够不加以爱惜呢？
    去年遭受水灾的多数地区，今年获得了丰收之后，更要注意节约粮食。这些地区所以能够稳稳渡过去年那些严重的灾害，得到今年这样好的丰收，最重要的原因之一，是国家实行了粮食统购统销政策，掌握了可以应付各方面需要的粮食。谁浪费了粮食，谁就削弱了自己和国家防御灾害的力量。爱国的农民当然会懂得这个道理。
    有人说：“三定政策规定产量、购量三年不变，增产不增购，我手头的粮食越过越多，还节约什么？”这是根本误解了粮食“三定”政策的意义。国家实行“三定”政策，是为了使粮食统购统销制度化，鼓励农民积极生产，支援国家的工业建设，并且不断地改善农民的生活。如果因为国家实行了
  “三定”政策，反而大吃大喝地浪费起来，那末，有些余粮户和自给户就可能变成缺粮户，这就势必影响国家粮食购销计划的稳定，损害粮食“三定”政策的效果。这难道是新中国的农民应该作的吗？
    有人说：“现在多吃点粮食，没什么，政府会供应的！”这种想法更错误了。实行粮食“三定”以后，国家减少了粮食购量，必然要严格控制粮食销量；如果销量不能控制，购量也就无法稳定。国家向哪些人供应粮食，供应多少，什么时候供应，都有了计划，已经不可能也不允许继续超计划地供应粮食。可以说，谁浪费了粮食而来要求国家供应粮食，谁就是迫使国家破坏粮食统销计划。这对国家固然有极大的害处，对农民更不会有任何好处！
    我们不仅要对农民进行广泛深入的节约粮食的宣传，还要帮助农民作出具体的节约粮食的计划。像上面提到的那些浪费粮食的现象，一般说还不难纠正。因为它们太严重，早为农村舆论所不容，只要进一步把道理说清楚，农民就会改正过来。但是，我们还必须同时注意纠正那些不大为人注意的浪费粮食的现象，而纠正这些浪费现象的最可靠的办法，就是帮助农民制定日常节约用粮的计划。比如应当提倡农民养鸡养鸭，不能因为节约粮食就不养，在农村里有很多喂鸡鸭的代食品，完全可以作到又要多养鸡鸭，又能节约粮食。湖南衡南县大岭乡中共支部为了发动农民节约粮食，专门召开了互助合作代表会议，表扬节约粮食的模范，批评浪费粮食的现象。支部帮助大家算了一笔账：全乡共有两万八千八百多只鸡鸭，经常消耗许多粮食。如果在饲养的时候加以注意，采用一些代食品，每只每月少喂两合米，全乡五个月能够节约四万多斤粮食。这个数字使到会的农民大吃一惊，人们响应支部的号召，都来制定每月用粮计划。这样一来，大家过日子“心中有数”了，浪费粮食的现象就大大减少了。
    为了一点一滴地在日常生活中节约粮食，必须把广大农村妇女发动起来。她们担任作饭、喂猪、养鸡等任务，每个家庭消费的粮食，大部分要从她们手中进出。她们如果都学会精打细算地过日子，必能节约许多粮食。湖南和其他省区的许多乡村，由党支部、农业合作社或妇联会召开妇女座谈会，从大处宣传节约粮食的意义，从小处研究节约粮食的办法，发动大家在日常生活中注意节省，已被证明很有作用。
    发动农民节约粮食，还必须同落后的思想习惯作斗争。但是，只要真正掌握了农民的思想状况，采用适当方法，进行说服教育，同样可以达到目的。辽宁台安县三界沧屯有三家农民，准备在旧历十月一日杀三口肥猪祭神，给小孩“还愿”治病。中共支部书记杨恩德耐心地给这三户农民算细账，说明这种作法是很大的浪费，而且会把病耽误了；要想治好病，赶快请医生。这三户农民听了有道理，改变了杀猪“还愿”的习惯作法。孩子的病被医生治好了，还节约了一千五百斤高粱米。
    节约粮食是全国人民的长期任务。随着农业生产的发展，农民手中的粮食一天天多起来，必须说服农业合作社社员、互助组员和个体农民，为了国家的利益，为了自己的利益，在完成缴纳公粮和出售余粮的任务以后，把多余的粮食加以合理的使用和支配。应该尽力购买生产资料，扩大明年的生产，在这个前提之下适当地改善生活，绝对不要把粮食和钱浪费掉了。我国农民一向勤劳俭朴，厌恶浮华浪费，特别厌恶糟踏粮食，认为是一种违反基本道德的罪恶。我们一定要教育农民把这个优良传统发扬光大。
