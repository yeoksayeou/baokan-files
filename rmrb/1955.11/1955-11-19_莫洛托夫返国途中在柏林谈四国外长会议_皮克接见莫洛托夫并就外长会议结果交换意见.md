　　Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: Berlin – The Soviet delegation to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, led by Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs V.M. Molotov, arrived in Berlin on the 17th on its way back to Moscow from Geneva.
    Molotov delivered a speech at the airport. He pointed out: Among the many important international issues discussed at the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the main one was the issue of guaranteeing European security. The people of all European countries know that the most important task at present is nothing more than preventing a new war. To this end, it is necessary to establish a European collective security organization that includes all European countries (regardless of these countries' national systems and social systems). To this end, it is necessary to stop establishing military blocs that pit some European countries against others.
    Molotov said: The Geneva conference proved that we have not yet reached the necessary agreement with some Western countries on major issues. This situation has created difficulties in resolving the German question. The Soviet delegation has no reason to agree to let the resolution of the German question produce such a result: not only to remilitarize West Germany, but also to remilitarize East Germany, dragging the entire Germany into certain military groups, as suggested by the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France at the meeting.
    In this situation, the German Democratic Republic, which is loyal to the cause of the working class and all working people, bears a special responsibility for defending the national interests of all German people and the interests of European security, and should play a glorious role. Only on the basis of uniting the peaceful forces of all German people and further strengthening the friendly relations between the people of all European countries can positive results be achieved on all these issues.
    Molotov said: The German Democratic Republic's proposal to establish an All-German Committee is fully in line with these goals. The All-German Committee, composed of representatives from both the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, will lay the foundation for the unity of the peaceful and democratic forces of all German people. The establishment of the All-German Committee can also provide the possibility of restoring Germany's unification on the basis of truly free all-German elections, in accordance with the interests of European security and the national interests of the German people.
    Molotov said: The Geneva Conference has shown more clearly than ever before that without the participation of Germans in the conference, it is impossible to achieve effective results in resolving the German question. This matter is primarily a matter for the Germans themselves. It is impossible to force the German people to accept a solution to this problem from the outside. It is necessary to enable the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany to embark on the road of rapprochement and friendly cooperation for this purpose. The measures that the German Democratic Republic has taken in the past and is taking now are fully in line with this purpose. This will create realistic internal and external prerequisites for restoring Germany's unification.
    Molotov finally represented the Soviet government in wishing the German Democratic Republic and all German people success on this path.
    Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: German Democratic Republic President Pieck received Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs V.M. Molotov at Niederschönhausen Palace on the 17th, who was passing through Berlin on his way back from Geneva.
    The meeting was conducted in a friendly and sincere atmosphere. During the meeting, views were exchanged on issues related to the conclusion of the Geneva Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Particular attention was paid to the first item on the agenda – European security and the German question – and completely consistent views were reached on the results of the Geneva Conference.

　　莫洛托夫返国途中在柏林谈四国外长会议
　　皮克接见莫洛托夫并就外长会议结果交换意见
    据新华社讯　由苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫率领的出席四国外交部长会议的苏联代表团，从日内瓦回莫斯科途中在十七日到达柏林。
    莫洛托夫在机场发表了谈话。他指出：在日内瓦四国外交部长会议讨论的许多重要国际问题中，主要的是保障欧洲安全的问题。欧洲各国人民知道，目前最重要的任务无过于防止新的战争。为此，必须建立一个包括所有欧洲国家（不问这些国家的国家制度和社会制度如何）在内的欧洲集体安全组织。为此，必须要停止建立使一些欧洲国家同另外一些欧洲国家对立的军事集团。
    莫洛托夫说：日内瓦会议证明，我们同一些西方国家在主要的问题上还没有达成必要的协议。这种情况给德国问题的解决造成了困难。苏联代表团没有理由同意让德国问题的解决产生这样的结果：不仅使西德重新军国主义化，而且也使东德重新军国主义化，像美、英、法三国代表在会议上所建议的那样把整个德国拖入某些军事集团。
    在这种情况下，忠实于工人阶级和全体劳动人民的事业的德意志民主共和国，对保卫全体德国人民的民族利益和欧洲安全的利益负有特别的责任，并且应当起光荣的作用。只有在团结全体德国人民的和平力量并且进一步加强欧洲各国人民之间的友好关系的基础上，才能够在这一切问题上获得积极的结果。
    莫洛托夫说：德意志民主共和国政府关于建立全德委员会的建议是完全符合这些目标的。由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国两国代表组成的全德委员会将会为全体德国人民的和平、民主力量的团结奠定基础。全德委员会的建立同时还能够提供可能，以便在真正自由的全德选举的基础上根据欧洲安全的利益和德国人民的民族利益恢复德国的统一。
    莫洛托夫说：日内瓦会议比以往任何时刻都更加清楚地表明：没有德国人参加会议，就不可能在解决德国问题上达到有成效的结果。这件事首先是德国人自己的事情。不能从外界强迫德国人民接受这个问题的解决办法。必须使德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国为了这个目的而走上接近和友好合作的道路。德意志民主共和国过去已经采取的和现在正在采取的那些措施，是完全符合这个目的的。这样就会为恢复德国的统一创造内部和外部的现实前提。
    莫洛托夫最后代表苏联政府，祝德意志民主共和国和全体德国人民在这条道路上获得成功。
    据新华社讯　德意志民主共和国总统皮克十七日在尼德申豪森宫接见了从日内瓦返国路过柏林的苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫。
    接见时的会谈是在友好和诚挚的气氛中进行的，在会谈时曾经就同日内瓦四国外交部长会议结束有关的问题交换了意见。会谈特别注意到第一项议程——欧洲安全和德国问题，并且对日内瓦会议的结果得出完全一致的看法。
