National middle schools, primary schools, and normal schools at all levels will gradually use Mandarin Chinese for teaching, so that students can learn to speak Mandarin. To this end, the Ministry of Education issued instructions to national education administrative departments on the 17th, requiring education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to include the promotion of Mandarin Chinese in their work plans, and to focus on training teachers and compiling textbooks.

The instruction stated: Vigorously promoting Mandarin Chinese among the Han nationality, which accounts for more than 90 percent of the country's population, has become an urgent task for our country. Using Mandarin Chinese for teaching in middle schools, primary schools, and normal schools at all levels will play a significant positive role in improving teaching quality. Students who learn to speak Mandarin will have a better communication tool for engaging in various construction works after graduation, which will facilitate bringing their talents into full play.

The instruction pointed out that the use of Mandarin Chinese in schools should start with the language and literature (语文) subject, and gradually extend to all subjects; extracurricular activities in middle schools, primary schools, and normal schools at all levels should use Mandarin Chinese as much as possible; in ethnic minority schools with Chinese language courses, these courses should be taught in Mandarin Chinese. The instruction puts forward the following preliminary requirements for students to learn Mandarin Chinese: middle and primary school students should learn the phonetic alphabet (currently using the National Phonetic Alphabet), be able to pronounce, spell, and read accurately; primary school students should practice speaking Mandarin Chinese inside and outside the classroom; middle school students should also speak Mandarin Chinese inside and outside the classroom; in addition to reaching the level of middle school students, students in normal schools at all levels should also master basic phonetic knowledge and conduct trial teaching in Mandarin Chinese.

The instruction requires that language and literature teachers in primary schools, the first year of junior high school and normal schools nationwide be trained by the summer vacation of 1956, in order to lay the foundation for teaching in Mandarin Chinese; teachers of other subjects who should be trained should complete intensive training by 1958. The Ministry of Education has decided to jointly organize the Beijing Phonetics Research Class with the Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to help various regions cultivate the backbone for promoting Mandarin Chinese. According to the requirements of this instruction, language and literature teachers in middle schools and normal schools will be trained by the provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus, primary school language and literature teachers will be trained by the county, city, and district education administrative departments, and teachers of other subjects and teachers of higher normal schools will organize self-study according to the situation of the schools. Provincial and municipal education departments and bureaus should open training classes for lecturers in phonetics to train lecturers for Beijing phonetics training classes in counties, cities, and districts, and open Beijing phonetics training classes for language and literature teachers in middle schools and normal schools. The instruction believes that to solve the problem of teachers teaching Beijing phonetics, the potential of society should also be fully tapped.

The instruction stipulates that those who have made significant achievements in promoting Mandarin Chinese and teachers who have achieved significant results in improving teaching quality by teaching in Mandarin Chinese should be rewarded. The instruction points out: In the future, speech contests within schools and localities must be conducted in Mandarin Chinese, and Mandarin Chinese should be used as one of the evaluation criteria. Schools and localities should specifically hold competitions to test the achievements of learning Mandarin Chinese; literary and artistic competitions for the masses and students in various places should use Mandarin Chinese, except for local operas, and Mandarin Chinese should be used as one of the evaluation criteria.

The instruction also made relevant provisions on the issue of editing textbooks and reference materials. The instruction said that the Ministry of Education is also preparing to consult with the Central People's Broadcasting Station to hold a lecture series on Beijing phonetics teaching, which will be broadcast regularly to help middle and primary school teachers and the masses learn Mandarin Chinese. The instruction also pointed out that it is necessary to mobilize the strength of all relevant parties to carry out publicity about the promotion of Mandarin Chinese to the general public through a variety of ways.

　　中学小学和师范学校将逐步用普通话教学
　　教育部指示各级大力训练师资并且编辑教材
    全国中、小学和各级师范学校将逐步用普通话教学，使学生学会说普通话。教育部为此在十七日向全国教育行政部门发出指示，要求各省、市教育厅、局将推广普通话列入工作计划之内，并且着重进行训练师资和编辑教材等工作。
    指示说：在占全国人口百分之九十以上的汉民族中间，大力推广普通话，已经成为我国当前的迫切任务。在中、小学和各级师范学校中用普通话教学，对于提高教学质量将起重大的积极作用。学生学会说普通话，毕业以后从事各项建设工作就有了更好的交际工具，更便于发挥自己的才能。
    这个指示指出，在学校中用普通话教学，应先从语文科做起，逐渐推广到各科；中、小学和各级师范学校的课外活动应尽量使用普通话；在设有汉语课的民族学校中，汉语课应该用普通话教学。指示中对学生学习普通话，提出以下初步要求：中、小学的学生应该学会拼音字母（暂用注音字母），能准确地发音、拼音和朗读；小学生在课内外应该练习说普通话；中学生在课内外也应该说普通话；各级师范学校学生的普通话水平除应该达到中学生的程度外，还应该掌握基本的语音知识，用普通话试教。
    这个指示要求在一九五六年暑假期内，将全国小学、初中一年级和师范学校的语文教师训练完毕，以便打下用普通话教学的基础；其他各科应该受训练的教师到一九五八年的时候集训完毕。教育部已决定会同中国科学院语言研究所举办北京语音研究班，帮助各地培养推广普通话的骨干。根据这个指示的要求，中学和师范学校的语文教师将由省、市教育厅、局负责训练，小学语文教师由县和市、区教育行政部门负责训练，其他各科教师和高等师范学校教师由学校根据情况组织自学。省、市教育厅、局应开办语音讲师训练班，给县和市、区小学北京语音训练班训练讲师，并且为中学和师范学校的语文教师开办北京语音训练班。指示认为，解决教北京语音的师资问题，还应充分发掘社会的潜力。
    指示规定对推广普通话工作有显著成绩的以及教师用普通话教学对提高教学质量有显著效果的人要给予奖励。指示指出：今后学校内部和地方的讲演比赛必须用普通话，并且以普通话作为评定标准之一，学校和地方应专门举办测验学习普通话的成绩的比赛；各地举办群众和学生的文艺竞赛，除地方戏外，应使用普通话，并且以普通话作为评定标准之一。
    指示中对编辑教材和参考资料问题也做了有关的规定。指示说，教育部还准备商请中央人民广播电台举办北京语音教学讲座，定期联播，帮助中、小学教师和人民群众学习普通话。指示还指出，要动员各有关方面的力量，通过多种多样方式，向广大人民群众进行关于推行普通话的宣传。
