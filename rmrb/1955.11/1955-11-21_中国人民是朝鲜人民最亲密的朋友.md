    The Chinese People are the Korean People's Closest Friends
　　Cui Wenqi, Head of the Korean Youth Art Troupe
    Our visit and performance in China for more than fifty days has been the most exciting event in our artistic life, a period full of profound impressions. We will never forget these valuable days of learning.
    Our art troupe has made friendly visits and performances to many cities such as Harbin, Changchun, Shenyang, Tianjin, Jinan, Nanjing, and Shanghai via Manzhouli. These performances were successfully carried out under the kind and deep care of the brotherly Chinese people. The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League provided various conditions for our performances as if they were their own work. Therefore, on behalf of all comrades of the Korean Youth Art Troupe, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Central Committee of the Youth League.
    At every station we arrived at, we were warmly welcomed, and every time we visited a factory, enterprise unit, or cultural palace, we received cordial receptions and guidance. In every theater where we performed, we received enthusiastic applause from the audience. Through these activities, we deeply felt the love and friendship of the 600 million Chinese people towards the Korean people, and we are even more convinced that the internationalist and brotherly unity between our two peoples, forged with blood, is unbreakable and will be increasingly consolidated. All this deeply moved the members of our art troupe, and we could not restrain our inner excitement. Therefore, we all sang and danced to our hearts' content with this excitement. What particularly moved us was that the veterans and families of the Chinese People's Volunteers who had fought heroically on the Korean battlefield were very happy after watching our consolation performances and kept applauding us warmly. Even elderly old ladies came onto the stage and held the hands of our art troupe members tightly as if they were their own children. When visiting the Shanghai Children's Palace, the lovely Young Pioneers presented us with red scarves and said: "Dear brothers and sisters! We warmly welcome you to bring us beautiful dances and songs. Brothers and sisters, after you return to your country, please say hello to Marshal Kim Il-sung on our behalf and send him and the young comrades in Korea our humble gifts." These touching things will forever be engraved in our memories.
    Our days in China were the most precious learning period in our lives. During this period, we visited many factories and cultural facilities and appreciated many works of art.
    When we visited the modern First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, which was built under the care of the great Chinese Communist Party, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, we saw the fighting spirit of the young workers who have mastered a high level of technology and are engaged in creative labor for the socialist construction of the motherland with an optimistic spirit. We felt infinite excitement and great encouragement that we have such strong friends as our comrades. When we visited the Industrial Exhibition Hall in Shenyang, the rapidly developing modern industrial face of China further encouraged our confidence in engaging in reconstruction. At the same time, when we visited various cultural facilities in Tianjin and Shanghai, we also saw the glorious traditions of the Chinese revolutionary struggle and learned about the deep concern of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government for the cultural life of the people. We also learned about China's splendid culture and history of five thousand years, saw the close friendly relations between the Chinese and Korean people since ancient times, and saw the increasing improvement of the material and cultural living standards of the Chinese working class and the role of workers' clubs in discovering the artistic creative talents of the working masses. We were particularly impressed by this when we visited the Shanghai Workers' Amateur Art Creation Exhibition.
    Through our visits to the Children's Homes, we saw the perfect equipment for developing the intellectual and physical education of children—the future masters—and were deeply moved by the happy lives of the Chinese children growing up under the kind care of the Party and the state.
    The famous Chinese Yue Opera and Peking Opera that we appreciated during our visit and performance in China, as well as the seminars with Chinese cultural and artistic workers, enabled us to learn many things that can serve as models for our artistic creation work. In particular, when we were in Jinan, we had the honor of meeting Mr. Zhou Xinfang, a famous Peking Opera actor who is loved and respected by the Chinese people. He personally performed for us, which made us feel very honored. Mr. Zhou's understanding of the inner world of art is a help to us young actors who are learning socialist realism performing arts.
    Before we came to China, we already knew that the Korean classical masterpiece "Chunhyangjeon" had been adapted and performed in various parts of China. When we personally appreciated the Yue Opera "Chunhyangjeon" in Tianjin and Shanghai this time, we were very surprised by the Chinese literary and art workers' profound research on Korean classical art works. Because the Chinese did not suffer restrictions or restraints from the original work when adapting it into Yue Opera for performance. The actors' skilled acting also made the performance successful.
    In a few days, we will end our performance in Beijing and return to our motherland. I would like to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League for inviting us to visit, and express the gratitude and friendship of the Korean people to the Chinese people who sent their outstanding children to help the Korean people in difficult times, and gave us great material and spiritual assistance in the post-war reconstruction period in our country. If our artistic performance can contribute to strengthening the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea and further promoting cultural exchanges, we will feel extremely honored.
    We wish the 600 million people of China brilliant achievements in socialist construction, in the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and in the struggle for world peace. Today, the Korean people have received selfless internationalist assistance from the great Soviet Union and China, as well as brotherly People's Democratic countries. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government, headed by our beloved leader Marshal Kim Il-sung, we will surely achieve greater achievements in the peaceful reunification of the motherland and in the struggle for strengthening the post-war reconstruction of the democratic base.
    Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea!

    中国人民是朝鲜人民最亲密的朋友
　　朝鲜青年艺术团团长　崔文岐
    我们在中国五十多天的访问演出，是我们艺术生活中最令人激动的事件，是一段充满了深刻印象的生活。我们永远也不会忘记这些宝贵的学习的日子。
    我们艺术团经满洲里到哈尔滨、长春、沈阳、天津、济南、南京、上海等许多城市进行了友谊的访问演出。这些演出都是在兄弟般的中国人民的亲切而深厚的关怀之下成功地进行的。中华人民共和国文化部和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会如同对待自己的工作一样，给我们的演出提供了各种条件。因此，我代表朝鲜青年艺术团全体同志向中华人民共和国文化部和青年团中央致以深切的谢意。
    我们每到一个车站，都受到热情的欢迎，每参观一个工厂或一个企业单位和文化宫时，都得到亲切的接待和导行。在我们公演的每个剧场中，都同样得到了观众们的充满热情的鼓掌。通过这些活动，我们深深体会到六亿中国人民对朝鲜人民的热爱和友谊，更加坚信我们两国人民之间的用鲜血凝成的国际主义的和兄弟般的团结是牢不可破的，并且将会日益巩固。这一切使得我们艺术团团员们深受感动，我们抑制不住内心的激动，因此我们都怀着这种兴奋的心情尽情地歌舞。特别使我们感动的是，曾在朝鲜战场上进行过英勇战斗的中国人民志愿军荣誉军人和军属们，观看了我们的慰问演出以后非常高兴，并且不断地为我们热烈鼓掌，甚至年老的老太太也上台来像对待自己亲生子女一样紧紧地握我们艺术团演员们的手。在访问上海市的少年文化宫时，可爱的少先队员们向我们献红领巾时说：“亲爱的哥哥、姐姐们！我们热烈地欢迎你们给我们带来优美的舞蹈和歌曲。哥哥、姐姐们，你们回国之后，请代我们向金日成元帅问好，并把我们微薄的礼物送给他和朝鲜的少年同志们。”这些令人感动的事情，将永远铭刻在我们的记忆中。
    在中国的日子是我们生活中最宝贵的学习期间。我们在这期间参观了许多工厂和文化设施，欣赏了许多艺术作品。
    当我们参观在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席以及人民政府关怀之下兴建起来的现代化的第一汽车制造厂时，我们看到了掌握着高度技术水平、以乐观的精神为祖国的社会主义建设从事创造性劳动的青年工人们的斗争姿态。我们以自己有这样坚强的朋友作为自己的战友而感到无限的兴奋和巨大的鼓舞。在沈阳参观工业陈列馆时，中国的迅速发展的现代工业的面貌，更鼓舞了我们从事恢复建设的信心。同时，当我们在天津和上海参观各种文化设施的时候，还看到了光荣的中国革命斗争的传统，了解到中国共产党和人民政府对人民文化生活的深切关怀。我们还了解了中国五千年来的灿烂的文化和历史，看到了自古以来朝中两国人民的亲密的友谊关系，并看到了中国工人阶级的物质文化生活水平日益提高的情况和发掘工人群众艺术创作天才的工人俱乐部的作用。在我们参观上海举行的工人业余美术创作展览会的时候，特别对这一点有深刻的印象。
    我们通过对少年之家的访问，看到了为了发展儿童——未来的主人翁的智育和体育的完善设备，对于在党和国家的亲切关怀之下成长起来的中国少年的幸福生活深为感动。
    我们在中国访问演出期间所欣赏的中国著名的越剧、京剧，以及同中国文化艺术工作者的座谈会，使我们学习了可以作为我们艺术创作工作榜样的许多东西。特别是当我们在济南时，曾会见了受到中国人民热爱和尊敬的著名京剧演员周信芳先生，他亲自为我们进行表演，使我们感到非常的荣幸。周先生对艺术的内心世界的体会，对我们这些正在学习着社会主义现实主义的表演艺术的青年演员们是一种帮助。
    我们在来中国以前就已经知道朝鲜的古典名作
  “春香传”已在中国各地改编上演。当我们这次在天津、上海亲自欣赏了越剧“春香传”以后，使我们对中国文艺工作者对于朝鲜古典艺术作品的深刻研究感到十分惊异。因为中国把它改编为越剧上演时并没有受到原作的限制和拘束，演员们熟练的演技也使得演出得到了成就。
    几天以后，我们将要结束在北京的演出而回到祖国去了。我再一次向邀请我们前来访问的中华人民共和国文化部和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会表示衷心的感谢，向在朝鲜人民困难时期派来了优秀儿女，并在我国战后的恢复建设时期给我们以巨大的物质和精神援助的中国人民，表示朝鲜人民的感谢和友谊。如果我们的艺术演出能够对加强朝中两国人民之间的友谊和团结、进一步促进文化交流作出贡献，我们感到无上光荣。
    我们预祝拥有六亿人口的中国在社会主义建设中，在解放台湾的斗争中以及在为世界和平的斗争中取得辉煌的成就。今天朝鲜人民受到了伟大的苏联和中国以及兄弟般的人民民主国家的无私的国际主义援助。在以我们敬爱的领袖金日成元帅为首的朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导之下，我们在祖国的和平统一和为了加强民主基地的战后恢复建设的斗争中，一定能够取得更大的成就。
    朝中两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和团结万岁！
