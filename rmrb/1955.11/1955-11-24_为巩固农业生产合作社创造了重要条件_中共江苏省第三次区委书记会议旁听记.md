    Creating Important Conditions for Consolidating Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
　　— Notes from Attending the Third District Committee Secretary Meeting of the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee
　　Jin Jingzhong
    From October 26th to November 8th, the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee convened the Third Provincial District Committee Secretary Meeting to study Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and the "Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party. On the basis of enhanced understanding, the attendees repeatedly discussed the matter, related to their own thinking and the actual situation of the current agricultural cooperation movement, and conducted criticism and self-criticism. This enabled the attending cadres to comprehensively and systematically understand the principles, policies, and methods of agricultural cooperation, unify their thinking, and create extremely important conditions for consolidating and improving the more than 140,000 new and old cooperatives across the province.

    At the beginning of the study, many of the district committee secretaries had a very incomplete and unsystematic understanding of the principles for developing agricultural cooperation. Some comrades even believed that the district committee secretaries did not need to understand the principles or grasp the principles. Wang Zhishun, Secretary of the Yangcheng District Committee of Wu County, said: "In the past, I simply did not study any principles. Whatever the leadership said to do, I would do it. If they said to develop, I would develop, and if they said to stop, I would stop." Wang Shutang, Secretary of the Xiting District Committee of Nantong County, had similar thoughts. After initial study, this thinking quickly changed. Some comrades said: "We were like blind men riding blind horses, not knowing where we were going!" Zhang Yutang, Secretary of the Chengxiang District Committee of Wujiang, reviewed: "In the past, my understanding of the principles was vague, and doing work was like 'a blind man groping in the dark, bumping into things everywhere'."

    During the study, everyone further criticized right-leaning conservative thinking. Then, the question of what the correct principles of agricultural cooperation actually were was discussed. During the discussion, some comrades raised several different formulations of the principles, such as "actively lead, steadily advance," "the secretary gets involved, the whole party runs the cooperatives," "only allow success, not failure," and now the "overall planning, strengthening leadership" principle. They could not understand the interrelationship between these formulations. Some comrades in the Suzhou area even thought that "actively lead, steadily advance" was "an old right-leaning conservative principle," "the secretary gets involved, the whole party runs the cooperatives" was "a small-scale development principle," and "overall planning, strengthening leadership" was the only "new large-scale development principle."

    In light of this situation, the CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee provided the necessary explanations. First, from the transformation of the nature of the revolution, the Party's program of socialist revolution, the relationship between agricultural cooperation and national industrialization and the transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, and the demands of the broad masses of poor and not-yet-prosperous peasants, it was repeatedly explained that the task of our Party is to actively, enthusiastically, and systematically lead the agricultural cooperation movement forward. At the same time, it was pointed out that as early as 1953, the Party Central Committee's "Resolution on Developing Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives" had already stipulated that the socialist transformation of agriculture must implement the principle of "actively lead, steadily advance." The Provincial Committee also made a clear explanation: "Actively lead means that the Party's leadership should not lag behind the demands of the masses and the needs of national construction. Steadily advance means that the Party's leadership should not exceed the level of awareness of the masses and the possible conditions." This is the basic principle that the Party has consistently adhered to in the socialist transformation of agriculture. The "overall planning, strengthening leadership" principle was proposed under the new circumstances in order to better implement the "actively lead, steadily advance" principle, and is a major development. The spirit of the two is completely consistent and there is no contradiction. In order to implement the "overall planning, strengthening leadership" principle, it is necessary for "the secretary to get involved, the whole party to run the cooperatives," otherwise, "overall planning, strengthening leadership" is in danger of becoming empty talk. "Only allow success, not failure" emphasizes the quality of the cooperatives, just as Comrade Mao Zedong instructed: "We must pay attention to the quality of the cooperatives from the beginning, and oppose the bias of simply pursuing quantity." This enabled the attending cadres to unanimously recognize that "the principles put forward by the Party Central Committee regarding agricultural cooperation include the entire content of the development and consolidation, quantity and quality of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and are comprehensive principles."

    Based on the spirit of "actively lead, steadily advance" and the development of the current agricultural cooperation movement in Jiangsu Province, the Provincial Committee pointed out that the first wave of the agricultural cooperation upsurge in the province has passed, and at present, development should be temporarily and comprehensively stopped throughout the province, and all efforts should be shifted to consolidation and rectification work. The various groups were organized to discuss issues such as "Why should development be temporarily stopped? How should development be temporarily stopped?" in order to fully understand the principles of agricultural cooperation.

    During the discussion process, some comrades lacked a correct understanding of the unity of development and consolidation, quantity and quality of agricultural producers' cooperatives. For example, Wan Weisheng, Secretary of the Sancang District Committee of Dongtai County, said: "I thought that large-scale development of cooperatives meant developing now, developing in winter, and developing again next spring. When I came to the meeting, my mind was full of development figures, and I didn't think that after development, there would still be consolidation." Zhou Fengwu, Secretary of the Sanzao District Committee of Funing County, said: "In the past, we one-sidedly believed that cooperative work was complicated, and the fewer the better to consolidate. Now that there is large-scale development, we one-sidedly believe that the more the better, and even if a batch collapses, there will still be another batch."

    Some comrades also believed that the cooperative movements in various places would advance at the same speed and develop according to the same model. Therefore, there was some blind comparison and competition. For example, the Secretary of the Third District Committee of Peixian said to the Secretary of the Fourth District Committee: "Our two districts were liberated at the same time. My district has developed more and your district has developed less. Either you are conservative or I am rushing ahead." During the upsurge of the movement, the district committee secretaries of Diandong, 　Jia, and Qiandun districts in Kunshan County often exchanged development figures over the phone, encouraging each other and secretly competing.

    Because the attending cadres had these ideological problems, their attitudes towards accepting the Provincial Committee's instructions to temporarily and comprehensively stop the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives and shift all efforts to rectification and consolidation were also different. Some comrades quickly realized the necessity of shifting to full-scale rectification and consolidation, consciously implemented the decision of the Provincial Committee, and immediately called back to the district to convey the spirit of the Provincial Committee's decision. Some comrades did not understand the true meaning of the Provincial Committee's decision, and developed a mood of numbness and slackness, thinking that they had completed the development task and could rest. Some comrades had ideological problems, disagreed with temporarily stopping development, and had an impatient and rash mood, wanting to "stop in name but not in reality." Some even asked: "What is the difference between 'braking' this year and 'braking' last year? Will we repeat the mistake of right-leaning conservatism?" "Will 'braking' frustrate the enthusiasm of the peasant masses?"

    In response to these ideological situations, the Provincial Committee led everyone to repeatedly study the documents of the Party Central Committee, especially focusing on the issues in the documents concerning the movement must have pauses and intervals, be realized through several waves of cooperation, concerning development and consolidation, quantity and quality, concerning the necessity of implementing methods that are appropriate to local conditions and timely guidance, etc., to compare their own understanding, carry out criticism and self-criticism; at the same time, everyone was guided to analyze the actual situation, and to see from the actual situation the necessity of temporarily stopping development and shifting all efforts to consolidation and rectification work.

    In the analysis of the actual situation, each group first checked the completion of the plan: By the time this meeting was held, 111,350 new cooperatives had been established in the province, and there were a total of 146,789 cooperatives, including the old cooperatives, which was more than 75% of the original development plan for the province for this winter and next spring. The number of peasant households joining the cooperatives has reached 50% of the total number of peasant households in the province. Most districts have also completed or overfulfilled the original development plan for this winter and next spring, and some have even overfulfilled it by more than double. Although individual counties and some districts have not completed the development plan for this winter and next spring, they have completed or are close to completing this year's development plan. Then, the class composition of the peasant households joining the cooperatives, their ideological situation, the composition and training of the backbone, the distribution of Party organizations and Party members, the progress of planning, the production and policy handling of the new cooperatives, and other aspects were checked. Everyone unanimously recognized that the mainstream of the movement is healthy, but there are many problems in the current movement. For example: The class composition of the peasant households joining the cooperatives: According to statistics from 765 cooperatives and 19,174 households in Lishui and Fengxian counties, poor peasants account for more than 53%, lower-middle peasants of new and old middle peasants account for more than 27%, upper-middle peasants of new and old middle peasants account for 17.1%, and small land renters account for 0.7%. In a small number of cooperatives, the organization is not pure. According to a check of 189 cooperatives in Taixian County, 1 landlord, 3 puppet village officials, and 13 puppet chiefs were mixed in, and some of them were even serving as cooperative cadres. The ideological situation of the peasant households joining the cooperatives: According to a survey of 1,029 cooperatives in Wuxi, Wu County, and Zhenze counties, more than 91% of the peasant households joined the cooperatives voluntarily, 7.1% followed the trend, and 1.7% joined the cooperatives hesitantly and reluctantly. The situation of the backbone: 84% of the newly established cooperatives have trained a backbone; 16% of the cooperatives have not trained a backbone; Among the backbone who have been trained: 58.56% are poor peasants, 28.11% are lower-middle peasants of new and old middle peasants, 10.75% are upper-middle peasants of new and old middle peasants, and 2.58% are others. The distribution of Party members in the cooperatives: 32.28% of the cooperatives in the province have three or more Party members, 46.69% of the cooperatives have one to two Party members, and 21.03% of the cooperatives have no Party members. The progress of planning: 18% of the townships in the province have carried out relatively comprehensive planning for cooperation, 62.85% have carried out preliminary planning, and 19.05% have not carried out planning. The main problems currently existing in the new cooperatives are: the production order of some cooperatives has not been established quickly; Due to the planning work not keeping up with the development of the movement, some cooperatives have also experienced the phenomenon of squeezing out poor peasants and forcibly pulling middle peasants into the cooperatives; The specific policy issues of some cooperatives have not been handled or have been handled relatively crudely; The grass-roots organizations generally feel that there is a "shortage of three things": a shortage of leadership methods, a shortage of Party members in the cooperatives, and a shortage of accountants.

    After analyzing the actual situation, everyone's minds became much clearer, and they fully recognized that the Provincial Committee's instructions to temporarily and comprehensively stop development and shift all efforts to consolidation and rectification work were timely and necessary. Everyone fully valued the quality and consolidation of the cooperatives. For example, Song Lianfang, Secretary of the Zhenze County Committee, said: "We used to only care about running forward, not looking back, only caring about development, not consolidation, and our heads were hot. We only saw that the masses demanded to run cooperatives, but we did not see that the broad masses of cooperative members urgently demanded to consolidate the new cooperatives, and the masses outside the cooperatives were also watching whether the cooperatives could be run well. After 'two rounds' (i.e., repeated study), we truly realized the importance of consolidating the cooperatives and improving their quality." Regarding the handling of some problems caused after stopping development, everyone's opinion is: Any cooperatives that have already been set up and have carried out collective autumn planting should strive to consolidate them and should not be simply "cut off." All those who originally planned to run cooperatives next spring should continue to do preparatory work and develop them according to plan next spring; Some can now first set up a preparatory committee to lead the preparatory work for building the cooperatives. If the backward state of the backward townships has changed and they have the conditions for building cooperatives, they can develop a batch according to the actual possibilities and the preparation work, but they should have planning and control. More importantly, they should immediately focus the enthusiasm and revolutionary fervor of the grass-roots cadres and cooperative members on rectification and consolidation work. In this way, everyone believes that as long as we have carried out sufficient ideological and organizational work, temporarily stopping development will not only not frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses, but can consolidate and improve the enthusiasm of the masses; On the contrary, if we only care about development and not consolidation, developing a batch and collapsing a batch will truly frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses.

    After fully estimating the problems existing in the current movement, some comrades' fear of difficulties in consolidating the cooperatives resurfaced. They saw that there were many problems in the cooperatives and did not know what to do. They lacked confidence in running the cooperatives well, and some even had panic and confusion, and wanted to mistakenly "cut off" the cooperatives again. This thinking was criticized in the discussion, pointing out that it was essentially a failure to truly and fully understand the principles of agricultural cooperation. Everyone believes that the conditions for consolidating more than 140,000 new and old cooperatives across the province are fully available. The problem lies in that we ourselves must actively study, overcome difficulties, follow the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, truly "delve into it and become experts," create typical examples, guide the general, and thoroughly overcome the two wrong ideas of arrogance, slackness, and fear of difficulties and retreat. It is entirely possible to consolidate and improve more than 140,000 new and old cooperatives across the province.

    为巩固农业生产合作社创造了重要条件
　　——中共江苏省第三次区委书记会议旁听记
　　金靖中
    中共江苏省委从十月二十六日到十一月八日，召开了全省第三次区委书记会议，学习毛泽东同志
  “关于农业合作化问题”的报告和党的七届六中全会（扩大）“关于农业合作化问题的决议”；并且在提高认识的基础上，联系思想，联系当前农业合作化运动的实际情况，反复地进行了讨论，开展了批评和自我批评，使到会干部比较完整地系统地懂得了农业合作化的方针、政策和办法，统一了思想，为巩固和提高全省十四万多个新老社创造了极为重要的条件。
    在学习开始的时候，区委书记中不少人对于发展农业合作化的方针领会得很不完整、很不系统，有一部分同志甚至认为区委书记可以不懂方针，不掌握方针。吴县阳城区区委书记王芝顺说：“我过去根本不研究什么方针不方针，领导上说干什么就干什么，说发展就发展，说停止就停止。”南通县西亭区区委书记王树棠也有类似的思想。经过初步学习，这种思想很快就转变了。有的同志说：“我们是盲人骑瞎马，自己也不知道走到那里去！”吴江城厢区区委书记张玉堂检讨说：“过去对方针认识模糊，做工作好比‘瞎子摸黑路，到处碰壁’。”
    在学习中，大家对右倾保守思想作了进一步的批判。接着，就讨论了农业合作化的正确方针究竟是什么？在讨论中，一部分同志提出了对方针问题提出了几种说法，如“积极领导，稳步前进”、
  “书记动手，全党办社”、“只许办好，不许办坏”，现在又有“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，弄不清这些提法之间的相互联系。苏州专区有些同志甚至以为
  “积极领导，稳步前进”是“右倾保守的老方针”，
  “书记动手，全党办社”是“小发展的方针”，“全面规划，加强领导”才是“大发展的新方针”。
    根据这样的情况，中共江苏省委作了必要的解释，首先从革命性质的转变，党的社会主义革命的纲领，农业合作化同国家工业化和对资本主义工商业的改造的关系，广大贫困的和还不富裕的农民的要求等方面，反复说明了我们党的任务就是要积极地热情地有计划地领导农业合作化运动前进。同时，指出早在一九五三年，党中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中，就已经规定了对农业的社会主义改造必须实行“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针。省委并且作了明确的解释：“积极领导，就是说，党的领导不应当落后于群众的要求和国家建设的需要。稳步前进，就是说，党的领导不应当超过群众的觉悟程度和可能的条件。”这是党对于农业的社会主义改造一贯坚持的基本方针。而“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，是在新的形势下为了更好地贯彻执行“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针而提出的，是一个重大的发展，两者的精神是完全一致的，是没有矛盾的。为了贯彻执行“全面规划，加强领导”的方针，就必须“书记动手，全党办社”，不然，“全面规划，加强领导”就有落空的危险。“只许办好，不许办坏”，就是强调合作社的质量问题，正如毛泽东同志所指示的：“必须一开始就注重合作社的质量，反对单纯地追求数量的偏向。”使到会干部一致认识到：“党中央提出的关于农业合作化的方针是包括了农业生产合作社的发展和巩固、数量和质量的全部内容，是全面的方针”。
    省委根据“积极领导，稳步前进”的精神，根据江苏省当前农业合作化运动的发展情况，指出了全省农业合作化高潮的第一个浪潮已经过去，目前应当在全省范围内暂时全面停止发展，全力转入巩固和整顿工作；并且组织各个小组讨论了“为什么要暂时停止发展？怎样暂时停止发展？”等问题，以求完整地领会农业合作化的方针。
    在讨论过程中，有些同志对于农业生产合作社的发展和巩固、数量和质量的统一性缺乏正确的认识。如东台县三仓区区委书记万维生说：“我认为合作社大发展就是现在要发展，冬季要发展，明年春天还要发展，来开会时满脑子是发展数字，没想到发展以后还要巩固。”阜宁县三灶区区委书记周凤五说：“我们过去片面地认为合作社的工作复杂，越少越好巩固；现在大发展了，又片面地认为越多越好，发展多些，就是垮掉一批还有一批”。
    还有些同志认为各个地方的合作化运动都将按照同样的速度前进，都将按照一个模型发展，因而有些盲目的互相攀比，互相竞争。如沛县三区区委书记对四区区委书记说：“咱们两个区同时解放，我区发展多，你区发展少，不是你保守，就是我冒进。”昆山县淀东、?葭、茜墩三个区的区委书记在运动高潮期间，经常通电话交流发展数字，互相鼓励，暗地比赛。
    由于到会干部有这些思想问题，因而接受省委关于农业生产合作社暂时全面停止发展，全力转入整顿巩固的指示的态度也是各不相同的，有些同志是较快地认识到转入全力整顿巩固的必要性，自觉地执行省委的决定，并且立即打电话回区传达省委决定的精神；有些同志不了解省委决定的真正意义，产生了麻痹松懈情绪，以为自己完成了发展任务，可以休息了；有些同志是思想不通，不同意暂时停止发展，有急躁冒进情绪，想“明停暗不停”，有的甚至提出：“今年‘刹车’和去年‘刹车’有什么不同？是否会重犯右倾保守的错误？”
  “‘刹车’是否会挫折农民群众的积极性？”
    针对这些思想情况，省委领导大家反复地学习党中央的文件，特别着重学习文件中关于运动必须有停顿、有间歇、经过几个浪潮来实现合作化，关于发展和巩固、数量和质量，关于必须实行因地制宜、及时指导的方法等等问题，来对照自己的认识，开展批评和自我批评；同时引导大家进行了实际情况的分析，从实际情况中来看暂时停止发展，全力转入整顿巩固工作的必要性。
    在实际情况的排队分析中，各个小组首先检查了计划完成的情况：到这个会议开会的时候为止，全省已经新建立合作社十一万一千三百五十个，连老社在内共有合作社十四万六千七百八十九个，已经超过原定全省今冬明春的发展计划的百分之七十五，入社农户已经达到全省农户总数的百分之五十。各区也大部分完成或超额完成了原定的今冬明春的发展计划，有的甚至超额完成一倍以上。个别县和一部分区虽然没有完成今冬明春的发展计划，也已经完成或接近完成今年的发展计划。再从入社农户的阶级成份、思想情况、骨干成份和训练的情况、党组织和党员的分布情况、进行规划的情况、新建社的生产和政策处理情况等各方面进行了排队检查，大家一致的认识是：运动的主流是健康的，但是目前运动中存在的问题不少。例如：入社农户的阶级成份：据溧水和丰县七百六十五个社，一万九千一百七十四户统计，贫农占百分之五十三多，新老中农的下中农占百分之二十七多，新老中农的上中农占十七点一，小土地出租者占○点七；少数社中还存在组织不纯的情况，据泰县一百八十九个社检查：混入了地主一，伪乡丁三，伪保长十三，其中个别的还担任了社干部。入社农户的思想情况：据无锡、吴县、震泽三个县一千○二十九个社排队，真正自愿入社的农户占百分之九十一多；随大流的占百分之七点一；思想犹豫勉强入社的占百分之一点七。骨干情况：已经训练骨干的合作社占新建社的百分之八十四；没有训练骨干的合作社占百分之十六；已经训练的骨干中：贫农占百分之五十八点五六，新老中农的下中农占二十八点一一，新老中农的上中农占百分之十点七五，其他占二点五八。合作社中党员分布情况：全省有三个以上党员的社数占百分之三十二点二八，只有一个至二个党员的社数占百分之四十六点六九，没有党员的社数占百分之二十一点○三。规划进行情况：全省进行了合作化的比较全面规划的乡数占总乡数的百分之十八多；进行初步规划的占百分之六十二点八五；没有规划的占百分之十九点○五。目前新建社内存在的问题主要是：一部分社的生产秩序没有迅速建立；由于规划工作跟不上运动发展，一部分社也发生了排挤贫农和勉强拉中农入社的现象；一部分社的具体政策问题还没有处理或处理得比较粗糙；基层组织领导上普遍感到“三少”：领导办法少，社里党员少，会计少。
    经过实际情况的排队分析以后，大家的头脑大为清醒了，都比较充分地认识到省委关于暂时全面停止发展，全力转入巩固整顿工作的指示是适时和必要的。大家都比较充分地重视了合作社的质量问题、巩固问题。如震泽县县委书记宋莲芳说：“我们以前只顾向前跑，不回头看一看，只顾发展，不顾巩固，头脑发热，只看到群众要求办社，不看到广大社员迫切要求巩固新社，社外群众也看着合作社能不能搞好；经过‘两个回合’（即反复学习），才真正认识到巩固社提高社的质量的重要性。”关于停止发展以后所引起的一些问题的处理，大家的意见是：凡是已经搭好架子，进行了集体秋种的合作社，应力争把它巩固起来，不允许简单地“砍掉”。凡原计划准备明春才办的，应该继续做好准备工作，到明年春季再按计划发展；有的现在可以先成立一个筹备委员会领导建社的准备工作。如果落后乡的落后状态已经转变，有了建社条件的，可以根据实际可能和准备工作的情况，发展一批，但是应该有规划有控制。而更重要的就是要立即把基层干部和社员群众的合作化的积极性和革命热情，集中引导到整顿巩固工作上来。这样，大家认为：只要我们进行了充分的思想工作和组织工作，暂时停止发展不仅不会挫折群众的积极性，而且可以巩固和提高群众的积极性；相反，如果只顾发展，不顾巩固，发展一批，垮掉一批，倒真正会挫折群众的积极性。
    在比较充分地估计了目前运动中存在的问题以后，一部分同志对巩固社的畏难情绪又抬起头来，他们看到社里的问题很多，不知如何是好，对办好社的信心不足，个别的甚至又有了惊惶失措的情绪，又想错误地去“砍掉”合作社。在讨论中批判了这种思想，指出它实质上还是对农业合作化的方针没有真正地、完整地领会。大家认为目前巩固全省十四万多个新老社的条件是完全具备的。问题就在于我们自己要去积极钻研，克服困难，遵照党中央和毛泽东同志的指示，真正“钻进去成为内行”，创造典型，指导一般，彻底克服骄傲松懈和畏难退缩的两种错误思想，巩固和提高全省十四万多个新老社是完全可能的。
