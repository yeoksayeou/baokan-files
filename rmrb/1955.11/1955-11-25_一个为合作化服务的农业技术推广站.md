　　An Agricultural Technology Extension Station Serving Cooperativization
　　Li Mingfa
　　The Yezhuhua Agricultural Technology Extension Station in Hailong County, Jilin Province, has been established for three years, and it has gained increasing prestige among the masses. Nowadays, farmers come to the extension station for solutions to both major and minor issues in production. Once, the piglets of farmer Li Chunqing from Xiaohebei Village suddenly lost their appetite. His family asked him, "What should we do?" He replied, "Isn't it obvious? Let's go to the comrades at the extension station!" The extension station has formed countless connections with the production activities of the broad masses.
　　Comrade Chen Xiuheng, the head of the extension station, often tells the comrades at the station: "If we want to do a good job in technology extension, we must frequently go deep into the cooperatives and mutual aid teams, help the masses solve problems in production, and closely integrate technology with the actual needs of the masses."
　　No matter when, wherever the cooperative's production teams are active, the staff of the extension station will follow. During the hot summer, people working in the fields sweat profusely. The extension station staff mix with the production teams, patiently providing technical guidance. When weeding, they notice that some members, greedy for more work points, disregard the quality of their work. They gently explain to them that poor quality will affect yield and advise them not to do so. Seeing some members accidentally step on seedlings, they carefully go over to help them up. The masses say with emotion: This is truly a new thing in the new society. The comrades at the extension station work so hard to help us with production. If we don't work hard, how can we live up to their enthusiastic help!
　　The technology extension station has eight staff members. Three are permanently responsible for artificial insemination of horses, while the remaining five are responsible for guiding agricultural technology work in thirteen villages, twenty-three cooperatives, and three permanent mutual aid teams. Based on the distribution of each village, the extension station links every two to three villages together, assigning specific personnel to be responsible for each area on a long-term basis, providing specific technical guidance. In addition to Xiaohebei Village, where the station is located, being the key village for the entire station, there are also key villages (or hamlets) within each area, and key cooperatives within each village (or hamlet). They use the methods of "using the station to promote the cooperative, using the cooperative to lead the team, and using the team to drive individual farmers" and organizing a technology extension network to promptly introduce and promote the experiences gained in the key areas to the broader surface. Each area makes a brief written report to the station at most every nine days. Every half month, the comrades in the area return to the station to report, collectively exchange experiences at "brainstorming sessions," study and arrange the next stage of work, and study at the station for two to three days. Then, everyone returns to their respective areas to specifically implement various technical measures and conduct roving technical guidance within each cooperative and team. The staff of the extension station also help cooperatives and mutual aid teams formulate small-scale work plans, reasonably arrange tasks, schedule time, and allocate labor. This ensures that various specific technical measures can be well implemented within mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Each village has established a technology extension organization (technology extension committee or technology research group). This vast technology extension network connects the areas, villages, hamlets, cooperatives, and teams vertically and horizontally, allowing them to communicate with each other and respond quickly to any call.
　　Before promoting each specific technology, the extension station prepares good examples in advance, demonstrating what to do, and then organizes the surrounding masses to observe, using vivid facts to inspire and guide farmers to adopt new technologies. For example, when promoting "straight-row rice planting," they organize the masses to visit fields planted with "straight-row rice planting" and "random rice planting" for comparison. The production team leader of the cooperative introduces the facts of the bumper harvests achieved over the years due to the implementation of "straight-row rice planting" and explains the specific methods. After the visit, the farmers respond: Hearing is false, seeing is believing. We have learned thoroughly this time and remembered it firmly. We guarantee to do the same when we go back!
　　Establishing technology transmission stations to train farmer technicians is a successful experience gained by the extension station in practice. The residences of technicians in each village and hamlet are very scattered. If they are all concentrated in the extension station to learn technology, it will be difficult for them to insist on regular systematic learning. Therefore, the extension station establishes technology transmission stations by area and region, convening technicians to give lectures at any time and place according to the needs of current work, imparting various technologies that are urgently needed at the moment. For example, during the summer hoeing season, when it was discovered that the progress of hoeing operations in each village was slow, and nocturnal cutworms and moths appeared in the fields, short-term training classes were opened in four "technology transmission stations," specializing in teaching the operating techniques of hoeing machines and methods of killing nocturnal cutworms. After the training class, the staff of the extension station went to the fields with the technicians to conduct field guidance. This kind of training method has greatly promoted current production. The role of this technology transmission station is very significant. In the first half of this year alone, 115 technicians of various types have been trained, and they generally play a backbone role in production. Jiang Zhifu, a technician from the Machang Village Central Agricultural Production Cooperative, can use four draught animals to pull a double-furrow plow for plowing. Due to his skilled technology, one person can save one labor unit by both holding the plow and driving the team, averaging seven mu of land per day. He plowed more than forty-one mu of land in six days, greatly improving work efficiency. Qu Yuefeng and Wang Guizhen, female technicians from the Liming Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yezhuhua Village, can independently operate new farm tools.
　　Correctly carrying out comprehensive technical guidance is an important working principle of the extension station. Each time the station leaders arrange work, they emphasize doing a good job in combining agriculture and animal husbandry and put forward the slogan "Ensure Both High Yields and Healthy Foals." For example, during the preparation period for spring plowing, technical staff went deep into each village, and while mobilizing the masses to collect manure sources, select seeds and test germination, and repair farm tools, they also held patriotic livestock increase competitions and meetings for owners of male and female livestock by village to help the masses select breeding sires and implement policies that benefit both parties. When cooperatives and mutual aid teams formulate agricultural production plans, they also help them combine to establish a reasonable quota system for contracting work and using livestock, and help cooperatives with many mares establish livestock breeding measures to avoid the bias of "emphasizing use and neglecting breeding." The spring planting season is also the appropriate period for livestock breeding, and the extension station put forward the slogan "Ensure Both Sowing and Mating" to educate farmers about "high yields and healthy foals, overall high production."
　　The achievements of the Yezhuhua Technology Extension Station are concentratedly reflected in the excellent performance of local agriculture and animal husbandry production. In agriculture, the unit area yield within the scope of the entire station in 1954 was about 15% higher than in other areas. For example, the 4,810 mu of land in Xiaohebei Village achieved universal yield increase due to the comprehensive improvement of production technology, increasing production by more than 20% compared to ordinary villages. Various crops planted with new-style farm tools in the whole village increased production by an average of more than 40% compared with those planted with old-style farm tools. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in this village planted 12 mu of soybeans with new-style farm tools, and the average actual yield per mu was as high as 508 jin, 212 jin more per mu than the same grade of land planted with old-style farm tools. This year, the farmland in various villages within the scope of the extension station's guidance has generally achieved a bumper harvest.
　　In animal husbandry, under the guidance of the technology extension station, 1,898 draught animals were vaccinated and 967 were quarantined for glanders in 38 villages in the district. Due to the vigorous promotion of artificial insemination technology for horses, more than 170 strong, tall "foreign foals" have appeared in more than 30 villages. Even farmers in the Wukuaishi Village in the Second District, 130 li away from the extension station, drove their horses to the extension station for mating. In addition, in 1954, the extension station helped the Xiaoguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Daliangou Village to produce 18,000 jin of silage feed using green corn stalks. Cooperative members reported: Silage feed has a natural fragrance and is watery, and livestock love to eat it. This year, the extension station has helped eight cooperatives to produce eight cellars of silage feed, totaling 150,000 jin.
　　The Yezhuhua Technology Extension Station has helped local farmers achieve bumper harvests year after year. With the vigorous development of agricultural cooperativization, the staff of the entire station are continuing to work hard to improve technical guidance work and enrich the content of technical guidance in order to serve agricultural cooperativization more effectively.

　　一个为合作化服务的农业技术推广站
　　李明发
    吉林省海龙县野猪河农业技术推广站建站三年了，它在群众中有了越来越高的威信。如今，农民们在生产上有个大事小事，都到推广站来要办法。有一次，小河北村的农民李春清家里的小猪忽然不爱吃食了，家里人问他：“咋办呢？”他说：“还用问吗？找推广站的同志去呗！”推广站同广大群众的生产活动结成了千丝万缕的联系。
    推广站站长陈修恒同志经常向站上的同志们说：“要想把技术推广工作做好，必须经常深入合作社和互助组，帮助群众解决生产上的问题，把技术同群众的实际需要紧密地结合起来。”
    无论什么时候，合作社的生产队在哪里活动，推广站的工作人员就会跟到哪里。盛夏季节，在田里干活的人们汗水直流。推广站的工作人员就夹杂在生产队中，耐心地进行技术指导。在铲地的时候，他们发现有个别社员贪图多赚分而不顾作业质量，便和颜悦色地向他说明作业质量粗糙会影响产量的道理，劝说社员不要这样做；看到有的社员不小心踩倒了小苗，他们会小心翼翼地过去帮助扶起来。群众感动地说：真是新社会出新事情，推广站的同志们辛辛苦苦帮助咱们生产，咱们再不好好干活，能对得起同志们的热心帮助吗！
    技术推广站有八名工作人员，除有三名固定负责马匹人工授精工作外，其余五名负责指导十三个村、二十三个合作社和三个常年互助组的农业技术工作。在这个地区，已推广了双轮双铧犁三十三部、单铧犁十八部、播种机十五台、钉齿耙二十八台、镇压器二十二台、综合号铲趟机数十台。根据各村的分布情况，推广站把每二—三个村联成为一片，采取专人分工、常年包干的方式，进行具体技术指导工作。除以站所在地的小河北村作为全站的重点村外，在每片内也有重点村（或屯），村（屯）内又有重点社。他们通过“以站推社、以社带组、以组带动单干户”和组织技术推广网的办法，及时把在重点里取得的经验向面上介绍推广。各片至多每隔九天要向站上做一次简要的书面汇报，每隔半个月，片里的同志回站汇报，在“碰头会”上集中地交流经验，研究安排下段工作，并在站内学习二—三天。然后，大家仍回到各片，具体贯彻执行各项技术措施，在各社组内进行巡回技术指导。推广站的工作人员还帮助合作社和互助组制定小段作业计划，合理地安排活计，安排时间，安排劳力。这样，就使各项具体技术措施能够在互助合作组织内执行得好。每个村里都成立有技术推广组织（技术推广委员会或技术研究小组）。这样一个庞大的技术推广网，使各片之间、各村、屯、社、组之间，发生纵横的联系，互相通气，一呼百应。
    在推广每项具体技术之前，推广站都要事先培养好典型，做出样子，然后组织周围群众观摩，通过生动的事实来启发诱导农民采用新技术。譬如在推广水稻“正行插秧”的时候，就组织群众到大田里对比参观“正行插秧”和“乱插秧”的稻田，由合作社的生产队长向大家介绍历年来由于推行“正行插秧”而获得丰收的事实，并介绍具体的做法。参观过后，农民反映：耳听为虚，眼见是实，这回学的透彻，记的踏实，回去后，保证照样做！
    建立技术传授站来培训农民技术手，是推广站在实践中取得的一条成功的经验。各村屯的技术手们的居住地点是很分散的，如果一律集中到推广站内学习技术，他们就很难坚持经常性的系统学习。因此，推广站便按片分区建立技术传授站，根据当前工作的需要，随时随地召集技术手讲课，传授当前迫切需要的各种技术。如在夏锄时期，发现各村铲趟作业进度迟缓，田里并且有夜盗虫蛾出现，便分别在四个“技术传授站”开办了短期训练班，专门传授铲趟机的操作技术和捕杀夜盗虫的办法。训练班结束以后，推广站的工作人员就随同技术手下地，进行田间辅导。这样的训练方法对当前生产的推动作用很大。这种技术传授站的作用是很显著的。仅在今年上半年内，就培养出各类技术手一百一十五名，他们在生产上一般都起到了骨干作用。马厂村中心农业生产合作社技术手姜志福，一个人能使役四头耕畜牵引双铧犁翻地，由于技术熟练，一个人连扶犁带赶套可以节省下一个劳力，平均每天能翻七亩地，六天工夫翻出四十一亩多地，大大提高了工作效率。野猪河村黎明农业生产合作社的妇女技术手曲月凤和王桂珍，都能独立驾驶新农具。
    正确地进行综合性技术指导，是推广站的重要工作原则。站的领导人员每次布置工作，都强调做好农牧业结合，并提出了“丰产丰驹两不误”的口号。如备耕时期，技术工作人员深入各村，在发动群众挖掘粪源、选种试芽、补修农具的同时，并且以村为单位召开爱国增畜比赛会和公母畜主座谈会，帮助群众挑选种公畜和贯彻执行两利政策。在合作社和互助组制定农业生产计划的时候，他们也帮助它们结合建立合理的包工定额使用牲畜的制度，帮助母马多的合作社建立牲畜繁殖措施等，避免“重使役，轻繁殖”的偏向。春种季节正是牲畜配种的适期，推广站就提出“播种配种两不误”的口号，向农民进行“丰产丰驹，全面丰产”的教育。
    野猪河技术推广站的工作成果，集中地表现在当地农业和畜牧业生产的优异成绩上面。在农业方面，一九五四年全站范围内的单位面积产量比其他地区高一成五左右。如小河北村的四千八百一十亩地，由于全面改进生产技术而获得了普遍增产，比一般村增产二成以上；全村用新式农具种的各种庄稼，平均比用旧式农具种的增产四成以上。这个村的前引农业生产合作社用新式农具种的十二亩大豆，平均每亩的实产量高达五百零八斤，比用旧式农具种的同等级土地每亩多收二百一十二斤。今年推广站指导范围内的各村的农田，普遍获得丰收。
    在畜牧业方面，在技术推广站的指导下，全区三十八个村内，实行防疫注射的耕畜有一千八百九十八头，实行鼻疽检疫的有九百六十七头。由于大力推广了马匹人工授精的技术，目前在三十多个村内已出现有一百七十多匹体质强壮、又高又大的“洋马驹儿”。连距离推广站一百三十里地远的第二区五块石村的农民，也都把马赶到推广站来配种。此外，推广站在一九五四年帮助达连沟村晓光农业生产合作社利用青玉米秸制造了一万八千斤的青贮饲料，社员反映：青贮饲料自来带有清香味儿，水汪汪的，牲口可爱吃啦。今年，推广站又帮助八个合作社制造了八个窖子的青贮饲料，共达十五万斤。
    野猪河技术推广站已经帮助当地农民连年获得丰收，随着农业合作化的蓬勃发展，全站的工作人员正在继续努力改进技术指导工作，充实技术指导的内容，以便更有成效地为农业合作化服务。
