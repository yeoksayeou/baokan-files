    An Engineering Section That Relies on Overtime to Complete Tasks

    To the Editor:

    The Main Factory Building Engineering Section of the Fourth Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which is undertaking the construction of the Datong Cement Plant factory buildings, frequently uses methods of forcing workers to work overtime in order to complete tasks. In May and June of this year, this engineering section accumulated more than 14,600 hours of overtime (equivalent to more than 1,600 workdays). In August, as construction entered a tense stage, the phenomenon of overtime became even more serious. From the 7th to the 20th, 275 workers worked 3,460 hours of overtime. Workers Zhou Shihai and others each worked continuously for 20 hours on August 25th. Steel bar foremen Lü Jianghao, Zhang Ou, and others worked continuously for five days and four nights from the 20th to the 25th.

    The administrative leaders of this engineering section also frequently adopt methods of disguised overtime such as "rotational leave" and "voluntary labor," extending workers' working hours without the consent of the trade union or the approval of the labor department, and without giving workers overtime allowances. When some workers are unwilling to work overtime, they even resort to means of coercion. For example, the veteran worker Xu Wenhe broke his foot after working eight hours of overtime one night; the next day, the foreman still asked him to continue working overtime. When he was unwilling to go, the foreman even notified the team leader not to record his work.

    Unlimited overtime has seriously harmed the workers' health. At present, the incidence of illness among workers in this engineering section is gradually increasing, and there are particularly many people suffering from headaches and eye diseases. This situation also threatens the safety of workers during production. For example, worker Xu Wenbin, unable to mentally cope due to continuous overtime, fell asleep on the springboard of the raw material grinding hopper, which was ten meters high.

    The Fourth Engineering Company of the Construction Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry should immediately correct the erroneous behavior of this engineering section in violating national labor laws.

### 一个依靠加班加点完成任务的工程段

    一个依靠加班加点完成任务的工程段编辑同志：
    承建大同水泥厂厂房工程的重工业部建筑局第四工程公司主厂房工段，经常用强迫工人加班加点的方法来完成任务。这个工段今年五、六月份加班加点就达一万四千六百多小时（等于一千六百多个工作日）；八月份施工进入紧张阶段，加班加点的现象更加严重了，从七日到二十日就有二百七十五名工人加点三千四百六十小时。工人周世海等在八月二十五日一天中，每人就连续工作了二十小时；钢筋工长吕疆豪、张鸥等从二十日到二十五日竟连续工作了五天四夜。
    这个工段的行政领导工作人员还经常采用“轮休”、“义务劳动”等变相加班加点的办法，不经过工会的同意和劳动部门的批准就延长工人的劳动时间，而且还不给工人加点津贴。有些工人不愿意加班加点，他们竟采用强迫命令的手段。如老工人徐文和在一天夜间加点八小时，把脚碰破了；第二天工长仍然让他继续加点，他不愿去，工长竟通知组长不给他记工。
    无限制地加班加点，已经严重地危害了工人的身体健康。目前，这个工段的工人发病率逐渐上升，患头痛病和眼病的人尤其多。这种情况还威胁着工人生产时的安全。如工人许文斌因为连续加点，精神支持不了，在高达十公尺的原料磨漏斗跳板上就睡着了。
    重工业部建筑局第四工程公司应该立刻纠正这个工段违反国家劳动法令的错误行为。
