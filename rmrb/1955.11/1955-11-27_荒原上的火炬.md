　　Torch on the Wasteland
　　By our correspondent Fang Qing

　　Since the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team arrived in Luobei County, they have received dozens of enthusiastic letters from young people all over the country every day, which has greatly encouraged the team members. Many letters also raise some common questions, such as "How did you settle down there?" "How did you reclaim the wasteland?" "How do you cultivate the new moral qualities of the team members?" These questions are well worth answering.

　　How They Settled Down

　　Luobei County is a very beautiful place. The county boundary is marked by water: the Heilongjiang River in the north and east, the Songhua River in the south, the Jiayin River in the northwest, and the Wutong River in the southwest. The northwestern part of the territory is the Lesser Khingan Mountains, a primeval forest covering an area of about 300,000 hectares, which blocks the cold currents from Siberia. Therefore, the coldest day on record here (1953), the temperature only dropped to minus 37 degrees Celsius. The Duluer River and the Yadan River also cross the territory, flowing into the Heilongjiang and Songhua Rivers respectively. The reclamation team settled in the middle of these two rivers, which is the central area of the county. This is a very flat area in the shape of a butterfly, with an area of more than 20,000 hectares. Twenty miles to its southwest is the state-owned Baoquanling Mechanical Farm. The team members were extremely happy to see the terrain here.

　　At the head of this "butterfly" is Tuanjie Village. The reclamation team chose a site three miles west of Tuanjie Village with a higher terrain to build their new village. The farmers of Tuanjie Village and another neighboring village, Wancai Village, helped the reclamation team build fifteen houses. The reclamation team also built five stables themselves. That's how they settled down.

　　The reclamation team dug a well in their new village. Digging a well was not difficult, only a little more than ten feet deep. The water was very sweet, and none of the team members had stomach problems after arriving. The team members said: With such sweet water to drink, we don't want to drink tea anymore.

　　They had prepared winter clothing long ago: sheepskin cloaks, rabbit fur hats with large earflaps, black cotton clothes, and cotton galoshes. As soon as the winter clothes were distributed, they put them all on. Speaking of clothing, we must thank the eleven girls in the team. For example, taking apart and washing bedding or adding cotton, they did it in their spare time outside of agricultural work. Although they all participated in heavy agricultural labor, as soon as they returned to the dormitory, they took the initiative to help the young men wash clothes and make quilts. Deng Guiying, because she worked as a cook and had more free time, would go to the beds to find clothes to wash as soon as the young men went to the fields, without asking whose they were, and fold them up and put them on the kang after washing.

　　They often eat rice, millet, cornmeal, and can also get enough vegetables. They eat so well that they are red and fat. Most of the team members have gained weight.

　　Young people from all over the country have donated more than 2,000 books to them, and they are starting to establish a small library. They also have musical instruments such as violins, huqins, and flutes. After meals and in the evenings, this new village is often filled with singing. The reclamation team has established drama groups, music groups, and acrobatics groups, and these entertainment organizations are actively rehearsing, preparing to perform at the welcoming party for the new team members.

　　How They Reclaimed the Wasteland

　　Reclamation, this is what they had been looking forward to for a long time. After arriving here, they started reclaiming the wasteland almost before they had time to unpack their luggage.

　　In the suburbs of Beijing, two mules can be used to plow the land. However, the wasteland in Luobei County is all virgin land, never plowed before. The soil is intertwined with tree roots and dense grass roots. As soon as they arrived, they asked the local farmers for advice. At the same time, ten young people from Huachuan County with proficient agricultural skills were sent to help them use six horses (later increased to eight horses) to pull double-wheeled single-铧 plows to reclaim the wasteland. The Huachuan youth personally demonstrated, telling them how to adjust the depth and how to repair the plow. Because the team members had only used cattle and mules at home and rarely used horse-drawn plows, they couldn't figure out their temper for a while; it also felt overwhelming to take care of a string of six or eight horses; especially the local horses didn't understand their commands and didn't obey. So the youth from Huachuan County patiently harnessed them and explained the temperament of the horses in detail... "High mountains can't block the sun, and difficulties can't defeat heroes," they quickly overcame these difficulties.

　　During the reclamation period, it rained almost every day, and the soil was very sticky. It took a lot of effort to pull out a foot. It was more than a mile from the field to the tent (the houses had not yet been built). At first, they would return to the tent as soon as it rained, and go to the field as soon as the rain stopped; but sometimes it seemed like they were deliberately joking, and the rain would start again just as they reached the edge of the field. The young men didn't want to be played by the rain anymore, and simply didn't go back unless it was a heavy rain. Li Zhenhua, who drove the horses, said: "Young people have fire in their bodies, and when the rain stops, the heat from their bodies will dry their clothes."

　　Plowing the land with a double-wheeled double-铧 plow was not done well all at once. At first, sometimes the clods of soil turned up by the 铧子 would not fall down. In this way, not only could the grass not be pressed under the soil to rot, but also the turned soil was uneven, which affected the harrowing later. Chen Qibin, the secretary of the Party branch, discussed this situation with Li Bingheng and found three reasons: First, the grass on the ground was high, second, the grass roots in the ground were dense, and third, the soil had strong cohesion. After they widened and lengthened the 铧子, there were indeed no more standing clods of soil, and the speed of reclamation also accelerated.

　　The girls were originally assigned to cut grass and dig tree roots; but they were not satisfied with this, so they elected Pang Shuying to learn how to hold the plow. Pang Shuying was very patient in learning how to operate the plow and how to repair the plow. She called Wei Fu, a youth from Huachuan, "Master Wei," and asked him whenever she didn't understand. Therefore, she was relatively skilled as soon as she started plowing. But the first time she held the plow, a tree root unexpectedly blocked the 铧子, the plow body tilted, and the two plow handles threw her far away, covered in wet mud. After that, when she held the plow, she stretched out her hands, tightly grasped the plow handles, and flashed her body outside the plow handles. In this way, even if she encountered any big tree roots, she would not be knocked down by the plow handles. She said: "This is an experience gained from a somersault."

　　They are training in the struggle for production in this way.

　　Two months ago, this was still a sea of withered yellow grass, but now, after the reclamation of the young people, eighty hectares of land in this sea have risen with black waves.

　　They Are Growing

　　Pang Shuying is considered the most active among the girls, and she takes the lead in everything. If the girls are assigned to cut grass today, she starts sharpening her sickle before others have put down their bowls; she starts cutting grass when others are still walking on the road. She thought: I am one of the initiators of the reclamation team, and I must do all the important work to the end, and I can't fall behind a step.

　　Later, Chen Qibin, the secretary of the Party branch, had a conversation with her, and Pang Shuying realized that the masses must be brought up to give play to the collective strength. After that, no matter what kind of work she did, she urged everyone to go together, and also led five girls to learn plowing techniques with her.

　　Gao Chongde, is an eighteen-year-old young man. When he participated in the work of digging tree roots, it was the time when there was a lot of groundwater and dense mosquitoes in the air. With his determination, he could endure any pain. However, one day he suddenly thought of his "little lover" - a very beautiful little girl who had been playing with him since childhood, studying together when they grew up, and were admitted to middle school together this summer vacation. Before the start of school, Yang Hua and others initiated the organization of the volunteer reclamation team. This matter spread to Gao Chongde's ears, and he thought: "My father and mother are both Communist Party members, and I am a member of the Communist Youth League. Of course, I must run in the front in response to the call of the motherland." He signed up without consulting anyone. Afterwards, he met his lover in a hurry and set off. Now he thought: "If she sees me now - covered in mud, with pimples all over my face from mosquito bites, swinging a large hoe here, will she still love me? Taking a step back: even if she is still so good to me, is she willing to leave Beijing? Is she willing to run more than 4,000 miles to live in a straw house?" This matter plagued him very much, and he was not so motivated to work.

　　The first person to discover his mood was Chen Baorong, the leader of the Youth League group, who had a sincere conversation with him. The partners also came to persuade him, and Chen Qibin, the secretary of the Party branch, also talked to him. At this time, he truly realized that as a member of the Communist Youth League, he should not be uneasy about production because of his lover's affairs. When his thoughts were clear, he was more active in production than before. Not long after, his lover wrote to him. Because he had joined the reclamation team, she loved him even more than before, and their feelings became closer.

　　Although this youth reclamation team only has sixty people, it is a torch for reclaiming the fertile virgin land of the motherland. Following it, more beautiful and fertile fields will appear on the grasslands of the motherland. (Attached picture)

　　The Huachuan County Committee of the Communist Youth League mobilized ten young people familiar with agricultural production techniques to help the Beijing Youth Volunteer Reclamation Team master reclamation techniques. This is Sun Gong (first person on the right), a youth from Huachuan County, explaining how to operate the plow to the team members of the reclamation team.

　　荒原上的火炬
　　本报记者　方青
    北京市青年志愿垦荒队到萝北县垦荒以来，每天都接到全国各地青年几十封热情洋溢的信，给队员们以极大的鼓舞。很多来信中也提出一些共同的问题：比如“你们是怎样在那里安居的？”“是怎样开荒的？”“是怎样培养队员们新的道德品质的？”这些问题很有必要加以回答。
      他们是怎样安居下来的
    萝北县是个很美的地方。县界是用水划成的：北面和东面都是黑龙江，南面是松花江，西北是嘉音河，西南是梧桐河。境内西北部分是小兴安岭，约占三十万公顷面积的原始森林，挡住了西伯利亚的寒流。因此，这里有记录以来最冷的一天（一九五三年），气温也只下降到摄氏零下三十七度。境内还横穿着都噜河和鸭蛋河，分别流入黑龙江和松花江。垦荒队就在这两道河的中间，也就是全县的中心地带定居的。这是一块蝴蝶形的非常平坦的地区，面积有两万公顷以上。它的西南面二十里的地方，就是国营宝泉岭机械农场。队员们看到这里的地形，都高兴得了不得。
    在这个“蝴蝶”的头部，有个团结村。垦荒队选择团结村以西三里远地势较高的地方建立起自己的新村。团结村和另一个邻近的村子万财村的农民帮助垦荒队盖了十五间房子。垦荒队自己也盖了五间马棚。他们就这样住下来了。
    垦荒队在自己的新村里打了一眼井。打井并不费事，只打一丈多深就行。水很甜，队员们来到后没有一个闹肚子的。队员们说：有了这样的甜水喝，再也不想喝茶了。
    他们早就准备好了冬装，羊皮大氅、大耳扇兔皮帽、黑棉衣、棉胶鞋。冬装一发下来，他们就全部穿戴起来。提起服装要感谢队上的十一位姑娘。比方拆洗被褥或者补充棉花，都是她们在农业劳动时间以外抽时间作的。尽管她们每人都同样参加繁重的农业劳动，但是一回到宿舍，就主动帮助小伙子们洗衣服，作被子。邓桂英因为作炊事员，空余时间多一些，她一等到小伙子下地以后就到铺上去找该洗的衣服，也不问是谁的，洗完就折好放在炕上。
    他们经常吃大米、小米、玉米面，也能吃到足够的蔬菜。他们吃得又红又胖。多数队员都增加了体重。
    各地青年捐赠给他们两千多本书，他们正着手建立小型图书室。他们还有提琴、胡琴、笛子等乐器。每逢饭后、晚间，这个新村经常飘荡着一片歌声。垦荒队成立了戏剧组、音乐组、杂耍组，这些娱乐组织正在积极排演，准备在迎接新队员的晚会上演出。
      他们是怎样开荒的
    开荒，这是他们早就向往着的事情，他们来到这里以后，几乎是还没等解开行囊就动手开起荒来了。
    在北京市郊，套两个骡子就可以翻地。但是萝北县的荒地都是生荒，从来没有翻过身，土里交织着树根和密密的草根，他们一来就向当地的农民请教，同时，桦川县派来十位农业技术很熟练的青年，帮助他们用六匹马（后来又增加到八匹马）拉双轮单铧犁开荒。桦川青年亲手作样子，告诉他们怎样调整深浅，怎么修理犁杖。队员们因为在家只使过牛和骡子，很少用马拉犁，一时摸不清它们的脾气；一连串赶六匹马八匹马，又感觉照顾不过来；特别是本地马不懂他们的口令，不听指挥。于是桦川县来的青年便耐心地给他们赶套，详细讲解马的性情……。“山高挡不住太阳，困难难不倒英雄”，他们很快便克服了这些困难。
    在开荒期间，几乎天天下雨，土又粘，一脚踏下去，要费很大的力气才能拔出来。从地里到帐篷（那时房子还没有盖起来）要走一里多路，先前是一下雨就回帐篷，雨一停就下地；但是有时好像故意开玩笑，刚走到地边雨又下起来。小伙子们再也不想受雨的摆弄了，只要不下暴雨，干脆就不回去。赶马的李振华说：“年轻人，身上有火，雨一停，身上的热力就把衣服烤干了。”
    用双轮双铧犁犁地也不是一下子就做得很好的。起初，有时铧子翻起来的土块扣不下去。这样，不仅不能把草压在土下面让它腐烂，而且翻的土不平，影响以后耙地。党支部书记陈起彬找李秉衡研究了这种情况，结果，找出来三个原因：一是地面上草高，二是地里草根稠密，三是土的粘结性强。他们把铧子加宽加长以后，果然再没有立着的土块了，开荒速度也加快了。
    姑娘们原来被分配割草、刨树根；但是她们不满足这些，便推选庞淑英去学习扶犁。庞淑英非常耐心地学习怎么操纵犁，怎么修理犁，她把桦川来的青年魏福叫“魏师傅”，一不明白就问。因此她一动手扶犁就比较在行。但是第一次扶犁的时候，冷不防一个树根挡住了铧子，犁身一歪，两个犁柄把她甩出去好远，滚了混身湿泥。这以后她扶犁，便把两手伸出去，紧握住犁柄，身子闪在犁柄的外面。这样，即使再遇到多么大的树根，也不会被犁柄拨倒了。她说：“这是一个跟斗跌出来的经验。”
    他们就这样在生产斗争中锻炼着。
    两个月以前，这里还是一片枯黄的草海，现在，经过青年们的开垦，这个海里已经有八十公顷土地泛起黑色的波浪了。
      他们在成长
    庞淑英在姑娘们当中要算最积极的了，什么事情她都走在前面。如果今天分配姑娘们割草，别人还没有放下饭碗，她就开始磨镰刀了；别人还在路上走着的时候，她已经开始割起草来了。她想：我是垦荒队的发起人之一，什么重要工作也得做到头里，一步也不能落后。
    后来党支部书记陈起彬找她谈了一次话，庞淑英才感到：必须把群众带起来，才能发挥集体力量。这以后，她不论作什么活，都是督促大家一起走，还带动五位姑娘跟她一起学习扶犁技术。
    高崇德，是个十八岁的小伙子，当他参加刨树根工作的时候，正是地下水多空中蚊子密的时候。凭他的决心，什么痛苦都能忍受。可是，有一天忽然想起他的“小爱人”来了——那是个很漂亮的小姑娘，从小就和他在一起玩，大了一起念书，今年暑假还一起考上了中学。还没到开学的时候，杨华他们发起组织志愿垦荒队，这件事传到了高崇德的耳朵里，他想：“我父亲和母亲都是共产党员，自己是青年团员，祖国的号召，我当然要跑在前面。”他没有同谁商量就报了名。事后同他的爱人匆匆见了一面就出发了。现在他想：“她要是看到我现在的样子——混身泥，满脸是蚊子叮的疙瘩，在这里抡大镐，她还能爱我吗？退一步想：就算她对我还是那末好，她舍得离开北京吗？她肯跑四千多里地来住草房吗？”这个事缠的他很焦心，干活也不那么起劲了。
    最早发现他这种心情的，是团小组长陈宝荣，跟他作了一次恳切的谈话。伙伴们也来劝导他，党支部书记陈起彬也找他谈了话。这时候，他真正体会到：作为一个青年团员，不应当为爱人的事情不安心生产。思想搞通了，他在生产上比以前更加积极了。不久以后，他的爱人来信了，因为他参加了开荒队，她比以前更爱他了，他们感情上更加接近了。
    这支青年垦荒队虽然才有六十个人，但是，它是开垦祖国肥沃的处女地的一把火炬，跟随着它，祖国的草原上将出现更多的丰美的田园。（附图片）
    青年团桦川县委员会动员了十名熟悉农业生产技术的青年，帮助北京市青年志愿垦荒队掌握垦荒技术。这是桦川县青年孙共（右第一人）在给垦荒队队员讲解操纵犁的方法。
