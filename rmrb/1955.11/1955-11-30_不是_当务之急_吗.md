　　According to materials from the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Statistics, most factories and mines overfulfilled their total output value plans in October, and there was also improvement in the completion of labor productivity and variety plans. This is a gratifying phenomenon. However, the completion of equipment overhaul plans still shows no improvement. According to statistics from 29 units, including the Fuxin Coal Mine, only 38 percent of the equipment overhaul plans were completed by the end of October. The Shenyang Smelter completed only 13 percent, the Fuxin Power Plant completed only 16 percent, and the Dalian Shipyard completed only 23 percent.
　　This situation shows that many enterprises have neglected equipment overhaul and maintenance work. Some enterprise leaders often regard this important work as not an "urgent task," believing that as long as the machine "can turn and can be used, it can produce," and adhering to the principle of "no repair if it's not broken, minor repairs for minor problems, and major repairs for major problems." They do not understand that machinery and equipment are an important material foundation for enterprises, and if equipment overhaul and maintenance work is not done well, it will bring serious adverse consequences to the enterprise. In fact, there have been many such lessons. For example, the newly built Anshan Iron and Steel Second Thin Plate Plant, after being put into operation for less than half a year, has been unable to maintain its original complete equipment status and precision due to neglect of maintenance and overhaul work. According to statistics, five machinery factories in Shenyang had more than 700 equipment accidents in the first half of the year, resulting in more than 12,000 machine hours of downtime and losses of more than 82,000 yuan.
　　Poor completion of overhaul plans will not only affect the completion of this year's production plan, but will also directly affect next year's production tasks. Isn't this an "urgent task"?

### 不是“当务之急”吗

　　不是“当务之急”吗
    据辽宁省统计局材料，十月份大部厂矿都超额完成了总产值计划，在劳动生产率和品种计划的完成上也都有了好转。这是一个可喜的现象。但是设备检修计划的完成还是没有起色。据阜新煤矿等二十九个单位统计，到十月底仅完成设备大修计划的百分之三十八。沈阳冶炼厂仅完成百分之十三，阜新发电厂仅完成百分之十六，大连造船厂仅完成百分之二十三。
    这个情况说明，许多企业忽视了设备检修维护工作。有些企业领导者往往把这项重要的工作认为不是“当务之急”，只要机器“能转转就能用，能用就可以生产”，“不坏不修，小坏小修，大坏大修”。他们不了解机器设备是企业的重要物质基础，如果不做好设备检修维护工作，就会给企业带来严重的恶果。实际上这样的教训已经不少。如新建的鞍钢第二薄板厂开工不到半年，因忽视维护检修工作，大部设备已经不能保持原来的完整设备状态和精密程度。据统计，沈阳五个机器厂上半年发生设备事故七百多次，停工达一万二千多台时，损失达八万二千多元。
    检修计划完成得不好，不仅会影响到今年生产计划的完成，而且将直接影响到明年的生产任务。这难道不是“当务之急”吗？
