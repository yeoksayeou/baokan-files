The construction of China's First Planetarium
Chen Zun Gui, Director of the Beijing Planetarium

With the strong assistance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, the All-China Science and Technology Popularization Association is preparing to build China's first planetarium – the Beijing Planetarium. After more than a year of preparation, construction officially began on the day of Frost's Descent (October 24th) across from the Beijing Zoo! Its buildings mainly consist of a celestial sphere hall, an exhibition hall, an astronomical observatory, a meteorological observatory, and an astronomical plaza, covering an area of approximately 40 mu. The establishment of the Beijing Planetarium is not only a great and fortunate event for the Chinese astronomical community but also holds significant meaning in the world of science and culture.

The celestial sphere hall will be equipped with a planetarium projector (formerly translated as an artificial sky projector), which is the most important piece of equipment in the planetarium. Its main part is a very complex slide projector made up of a motor and many gears linked together. It will project celestial phenomena such as the sun, moon, and stars onto a large dome with a diameter of 23 meters, which serves as a screen. This will allow us to see the moon, planets, and sixth-magnitude stars visible to the naked eye as clearly as we would observe the sky on a clear night, as well as all their movements in a short period of time. In addition, the planetarium projector can show us the sky phenomena of thousands of years ago or thousands of years in the future, and it can also indicate the celestial situation at any time and place. Therefore, in astronomical education, the planetarium projector is a very important piece of equipment.

The creation of this very precise planetarium projector used to explain the movement of celestial bodies is a recent development. After decades of research by German astronomers and mechanical engineers, it was successfully trial-produced in 1924. After the October Socialist Revolution, the Soviet Union established a planetarium using a planetarium projector in 1929. Before the Second World War, there were a total of 27 planetariums equipped with planetarium projectors worldwide, ten of which were destroyed during the war. After the war, the German Democratic Republic, in order to enhance the friendship between the Soviet and German people, specially gifted the Soviet Union with a planetarium projector. This planetarium projector was installed on Peace Street in Stalingrad and officially opened last September. It is the first planetarium projector in the world after the war and the eighteenth planetarium projector currently in operation in the world.

After the war, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and China ordered planetarium projectors from the German Democratic Republic. The planetarium projector ordered by China arrived in Beijing in early July this year. The United Kingdom, to date, does not have a planetarium projector. It was recently reported that they have also ordered one from the German Democratic Republic, but it has not yet been made. The price of a planetarium projector is very expensive. We were able to build the first planetarium in New China equipped with a planetarium projector within a few years of liberation, which demonstrates the importance our Party and government attach to scientific endeavors. If we look at the situation of various countries ordering planetarium projectors after the war, we can also see the superiority of the people's democratic system.

In the past, there were two ways in which various countries operated planetariums. One was for profit, treating it like a movie theater in a capitalist country, such as the planetarium in Stockholm, Sweden. The other was for educational purposes, treating it as an institution for popularizing astronomical knowledge and conducting research activities, such as the Moscow Planetarium in the Soviet Union. It is run by many astronomers and engineers who, through their joint research, have made many improvements to the planetarium projector of the Zeiss Optical Factory in Germany. They made the star images flicker and created projectors to represent celestial phenomena such as zodiacal light, comets, and meteors; these were not possible with the original German-made planetarium projector. They made the planetarium an institution of materialist education; they often use the planetarium projector to criticize the superstitious parts of ancient legends about astronomy, pointing out their errors. They teach the Soviet people what attitude and view they should take towards cosmic phenomena; in this way, the Soviet people, especially the Young Pioneers, can receive a materialist worldview education from an early age. In the Soviet Union, school students, as well as navigation and aviation personnel, use the planetarium as a place for their astronomical teaching practice. There is no doubt that the Beijing Planetarium's operating policy for the planetarium projector will follow the path of the Moscow Planetarium in the Soviet Union.

In ancient China, there were also creations of celestial instruments. The great astronomer Zhang Heng (78-139 AD) of the Eastern Han Dynasty created a celestial sphere that was rotated by a water clock. The person watching this celestial sphere in a secret room could see a certain star rising from the east, or a certain star rising to the meridian, or a certain star setting in the west; the phenomena he saw were completely consistent with the real celestial phenomena seen by people observing the sky outdoors. In terms of the mechanical knowledge at the time, the production of this celestial sphere had indeed reached a very ingenious level, and its function was very similar to that of a planetarium projector. Therefore, when various countries talk about the history of the planetarium projector today, they regard Zhang Heng's celestial sphere as the originator. Therefore, it has special significance to build a planetarium equipped with modern new-style planetarium projector in China, the birthplace of the planetarium projector.

The objects studied by astronomy are celestial bodies in remote space. Without huge telescopes and special instruments and equipment, it is impossible to understand the mysteries of the universe. The exhibition hall will regularly display photos and models of various celestial bodies and celestial phenomena, as well as meteorites and other physical objects; these exhibits will be used to conduct materialist education for the general public and eliminate superstition.

As the saying goes, "Seeing is believing." The Beijing Planetarium will also set up a small astronomical observatory with a 130 cm aperture telescope. Through this telescope, visitors can personally see the craters on the moon, Jupiter's four largest satellites, the hat-shaped rings of Saturn, and other celestial phenomena. At the same time, we also want to use this telescope to regularly observe sunspots and variable stars. The observation of sunspots will become part of the sunspot observation system of the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; through the observation of variable stars, we will establish the first amateur astronomer's variable star observation station in the motherland.

A simple meteorological observatory will also be set up in the Beijing Planetarium. We will popularize meteorological knowledge to everyone through concrete instruments and observations, and let people know the difference between astronomy and meteorology.

There are many people who are interested in celestial phenomena. Is there really Chang'e or the Rabbit God born during the Mid-Autumn Festival in the moon? During solar and lunar eclipses, is it true that a celestial dog eats the sun or the moon? Do the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl really cross the river to meet on the night of Qixi? How exactly do magpies build a bridge to bring this couple together? The astronomical plaza will be a garden where people can seek answers to these questions. We want to green and artisticize the astronomical plaza so that the young people and children of New China can regularly hold star and moon parties in this beautiful plaza; in addition to appreciating the beauty of nature in the universe, they can also sing and celebrate to their heart's content, enjoying the happy life that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao have brought to the young people and children of New China.

Beijing has the internationally renowned relics of ancient astronomical observatories, which are the site of the Yuan Dynasty Astronomical Observatory in Paozi River, Dongcheng, Beijing, the Ming Dynasty's Star Observation Platform, and the eight large bronze astronomical instruments of the Qing Dynasty Observatory. These astronomical instruments will be kept and displayed by the Beijing Planetarium, which will become a special exhibit in the world's planetariums.

The main purpose of establishing the Beijing Planetarium is to promote materialist natural science knowledge, mainly astronomy, to the broad masses of the people in our country, to promote scientific atheism, to eliminate the superstitious ideas and views of fate left over from the long-term feudal rule among the people, and to promote the great achievements of ancient Chinese astronomy, so as to inspire the patriotic thought of the masses. In addition, since there are still very few astronomical institutions in our country, astronomical education is not yet widespread, and there is a great lack of cadres for popularizing astronomy, the Beijing Planetarium should also become the center for popularizing astronomy in our country, the center for astronomy enthusiasts, and an important auxiliary institution for astronomical teaching. Since there are still very few strongholds for the popularization of other natural sciences, the Beijing Planetarium should also gradually do the popularization of scientific knowledge related to astronomy. More specifically, the tasks that the Beijing Planetarium should undertake are to regularly popularize scientific knowledge about the sun, moon, stars, and the structure of the universe to the broad masses of the people; to explain astronomical phenomena from a materialist point of view. To collect and organize historical materials on ancient Chinese astronomy and publicize and study them. To conduct systematic astronomical popularization education for students, and should also regularly and systematically hold navigation lectures and screenings for the troops, especially for sailors and aviators. To organize astronomy enthusiasts, organize astronomy groups in schools, and help and guide them in astronomical observation and learning. To regularly study the methods of popularizing and teaching astronomy, and to compile teaching materials, create teaching aids, and supply science and technology popularization associations in various provinces and cities with information on popularizing astronomy. To compile and publish books and magazines on popularizing astronomy, and to systematically compile a series of books on astronomical knowledge, so as to become the center for the supply of astronomical popularization materials in our country. In addition, it is also necessary to train cadres for the popularization of astronomy in a planned way. To systematically and regularly conduct some astronomical observations to enrich our country's astronomical observation records. And gradually carry out the popularization of scientific knowledge related to astronomy, such as meteorology, physics, and physical geography.

The task of the Beijing Planetarium is glorious and arduous. This kind of undertaking is still a pioneering work in our country, and we have no experience. We should humbly learn from the experience of various countries in this work, and especially should learn from the Moscow Planetarium and the Stalingrad Planetarium in the Soviet Union; because the former has nearly thirty years of experience and has made many creative improvements to the planetarium projector, and the latter has just opened recently and is the newest and most advanced model. As long as we study hard, we will certainly be able to successfully complete our tasks under the care and support of the Party and the government. (Attached image)

    中国第一座天文馆的兴建
    北京天文馆馆长　陈遵妫
    在中国科学院和北京市人民委员会的大力协助下，中华全国科学技术普及协会正在筹建我国第一座天文馆——北京天文馆。经过一年多的筹备，已于霜降节（十月二十四日）在北京动物园对过开始动工兴建了！它的建筑以天象厅、展览厅、天文台、气象台和天文广场为主，共占地约四十亩。北京天文馆的建立，不独是中国天文界的一件大可庆幸的事，就是在世界科学文化生活中，也是具有重大意义的事。
    天象厅里面将装置天象仪（从前译作假天仪），这是天文馆最主要的设备。它的主要部分是由马达和许多齿轮连锁而成的一种非常复杂的幻灯放映器，它将把日月星辰等天象投射在作为银幕的直径二十三公尺的大圆顶上，使我们能够如同观察晴夜的天空一样，清晰地看到月亮行星以及肉眼能够看见的六等星，和它们在短时间内所有的种种运行。此外，天象仪可以告诉我们几千年前或几千年后天空的现象，还可以指示我们任何时刻任何地方的天象情况。所以在天文教育上，天象仪是一种非常重要的设备。
    这种用来说明天体运行的非常精密的天象仪的创造，是最近几十年的事。经过德国天文学家和机械工程师们好几十年的钻研，在一九二四年才试作成功。苏联在十月社会主义革命以后，于一九二九年用天象仪建立了天文馆。在第二次世界大战以前，全世界有天象仪设备的天文馆，共有二十七座，而在大战期间，被毁掉了十座。战争结束后，民主德国为了增进苏德人民的友谊，特别赠送给苏联天象仪一架。这架天象仪装在斯大林格勒的和平街，已于去年九月正式开幕了。这是战后世界上第一架天象仪，也是目前世界上工作着的第十八架天象仪。
    战后向民主德国订制天象仪的有捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和中国。中国所订制的天象仪，已于今年七月初旬运到北京。英国到目前止，还没有天象仪，最近听说也向民主德国订制一架，还没有做成。一架天象仪的价格是非常贵的，我们只在解放后数年内，就能够兴建备有天象仪的新中国第一座天文馆，这表现了我们的党和政府对科学事业的重视。我们倘若从大战后各国订制天象仪的情况来看，也可以看出人民民主制度的优越性。
    过去各国对天象仪经营的方式，可以分为两种。一种是以营利为目的的，就是把它当做资本主义国家的电影院看待，例如从前瑞典斯德哥尔摩的天象仪就是用这种方式经营的。一种是以教育为目的的，就是把它当做一种进行天文知识普及工作和进行研究活动的机构。例如苏联莫斯科天文馆。它由很多天文学家和工程师来主持这个工作，他们共同钻研的结果，把德国蔡斯光学工厂的天象仪作了很多的改进。他们使星像能够闪动，并制造了表示黄道光、彗星、流星等天象的放映器；这些都是原来德国制的天象仪所不能表演的。他们使天文馆成为唯物主义教育的机构；他们经常利用天象仪来批判古昔传说中的关于天文方面的迷信部分，指出其错误之点。他们教给苏联人民对宇宙现象应该采取怎样的态度和看法；这样就使苏联人民特别是少先队员们从小就能够得到唯物主义宇宙观的教育。在苏联，学校学生以及航海航空人员都以天文馆为他们进行天文教学实习的场所。北京天文馆对于天象仪的经营方针，自然毫无疑义地要走苏联莫斯科天文馆的道路。
    在我国古代也有天象仪器的创造。东汉大天文学家张衡（公元七八—一三九年），创作过用漏水转动的浑天仪。在密室里面看守这种浑天仪的人，可以看到某星正从东方升起，或某星正升到中天，或某星正在西方落下去，他所看到的这些现象，正同室外观天的人所看到的真正天象完全符合。就当时的机械知识来讲，这种浑天仪的制作，实在是已经达到非常巧妙的程度，而其作用则和天象仪很相类似。所以，现今各国谈到天象仪的历史，都以张衡的浑天仪为开山鼻祖。因此，在天象仪发源地的中国，兴建装备近代新式天象仪的天文馆，具有特殊的意义。
    天文学所研究的对象，是在遥远宇宙空间的天体，非有巨大的望远镜和特殊的仪器设备，无法窥知宇宙的奥秘。展览厅将经常地陈列着各种天体和各种天象的照片、模型以及陨石等实物；用这些展品来对广大观众进行唯物主义教育，破除迷信。
    俗语说得好，“百闻不如一见”。在北京天文馆里，还设立一座小型天文台，里面将装设口径一百三十公分的望远镜。观众们通过这架望远镜，可以亲眼看看月亮上面的环形山，木星的较大的四颗卫星，帽子形态的土星光环以及其它天象。同时我们还想利用这个望远镜经常观测太阳黑子和变星。太阳黑子的观测工作，将成为中国科学院紫金山天文台太阳黑子观测系统中的一部分；通过变星的观测工作，将建立起祖国第一个业余天文家的变星观测站。
    在北京天文馆内，还要设立一个简单的气象台。通过具体的仪器设备和观测向大家普及气象方面的常识，并使人们知道天文学和气象学的区别。
    对天象感到兴趣的人是很多的。月亮里面是否真有嫦娥或有中秋节诞生的兔爷？日月食的时候，是否真有天狗把太阳或月亮吃掉这回事？七夕晚上牛郎织女是否真正渡河相会？喜鹊到底怎样搭桥，使这一对情人相聚？天文广场将是人们寻求这些问题的答案的园地。我们要把天文广场绿化起来，艺术化起来，使新中国的青年们和少年儿童们能够经常在这块美丽的广场上举行星月晚会；在欣赏宇宙空间大自然的美景之余，还尽情地欢呼歌唱，享受中国共产党和毛主席所带给我们新中国青年和少年儿童们的幸福生活。
    北京有国际闻名的古代天文台遗迹，这就是北京东城泡子河元朝司天台遗址，明朝观星台的房屋，清朝观象台的铜铸天文仪器八大件。这些天文仪器将由北京天文馆保管陈列，这将成为世界天文馆中的特殊展品。
    北京天文馆建立的主要目的，是向我国广大人民宣传唯物的以天文学为主的自然科学知识，宣传科学无神论，破除人民群众中因长期封建统治而遗留下来的迷信思想和命运观点，并宣传我国古代天文学的伟大成就，启发群众的爱国主义思想。此外，由于我国天文机构还很少，天文教育还不普遍，天文普及工作的干部十分缺乏，北京天文馆还应该成为我国的天文普及工作的中心，天文爱好者的中心以及天文教学的重要辅导机构。由于其他自然科学的普及据点还很少，北京天文馆还应该逐步地兼做同天文学有关的科学知识的普及工作。更具体些说，北京天文馆应该担负的任务是向广大群众经常普及关于日月星辰和宇宙构造的科学知识；以唯物观点来解释天文现象。搜集整理我国古代天文史料并加以宣传和研究。对学生进行系统的天文普及教育，还应该经常地系统地为部队特别是为海员和航空员举行航行的演讲和放映。组织天文爱好者，组织学校中的天文小组，帮助和指导他们进行天文学的观测和学习。经常研究天文普及和教学的方法，并编辑教材，创造教具，供应各省市科学技术普及协会有关天文普及的资料。编译出版天文普及方面的图书杂志，并有系统地编辑天文知识丛书，使成为我国天文普及资料供应的中心。此外，还要有计划地培养天文普及工作的干部。有系统地经常地作些天文观测，以充实我国天文观测纪录。并逐步地进行同天文相关的科学如气象、物理、自然地理等知识的普及工作。
    北京天文馆的任务是光荣而艰巨的。这种事业在我国还是创举，我们是毫无经验的，我们应该虚心地学习各国对于这种工作的经验，特别应该向苏联莫斯科天文馆和斯大林格勒天文馆学习；因为前者已经有了快到三十年的经验，并对天象仪作过很多创造性的改进，后者是最近才开幕的，是最新最先进的典型。只要我们认真学习，我们就一定能够在党和政府的关怀和支持下，胜利地完成我们的任务。（附图片）
