    Do a good job in the food rationing supply of towns and cities, and eliminate waste and speculative behavior in grain use by industry and commerce
    Liu Chaozheng
    After the implementation of the food rationing supply method, the grain required by industrial and commercial sectors that use grain as raw materials or auxiliary materials must be supplied after the businesses compile grain use plans, which are then reviewed and approved. At the same time, whether residents or transient populations, must use local grain coupons or national general-purpose grain coupons to eat or purchase rice, pasta, and reproduced products such as noodles, cut noodles, rice noodles, and rice cakes sold by the cooked food industry.
    The industrial and commercial sectors that use grain as raw materials or auxiliary materials produce or operate a complex variety of goods, require a wide variety of grains, and consume a considerable amount. According to a preliminary survey in Tianjin in July of this year, there were 9,521 businesses in the city engaged in the food industry, dealing in more than 300 kinds of food, consuming more than 10 million jin of grain in the entire month. In many transportation hubs and market towns, due to the frequent comings and goings of travelers, merchants, and farmers, the number of businesses engaged in the catering industry is very high. According to a survey in Sichuan Province, catering businesses in rural market towns generally account for about half of the total number of industrial and commercial businesses in the market towns. The supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors is broad, the quantity is large, and it involves many aspects of the people's economic life. The implementation of rationing supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors by household and the eating or purchasing of major grain reproductions with coupons are not only directly related to the production and operation of industrial and commercial sectors that use grain as raw materials or auxiliary materials, but also play an important role in saving grain, eliminating waste and speculation, ensuring the consumption needs of urban and rural people, and promoting urban-rural mutual assistance.
    Over the past two years, the state has implemented planned supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors. However, because many regions' grain authorities have not grasped the grain use plans of industrial and commercial sectors and have not strictly and conscientiously conducted inspections and management, the industrial and commercial grain-using sectors generally have illegal activities such as exaggerating the amount of grain needed, wasting, profiteering from speculation, obtaining grain by deception, hoarding, and reselling. For example, Lanzhou City discovered that the rice and noodle industry falsely reported business volume, exaggerating the amount of grain needed by as much as six times; the bean curd industry in Nanchang City resold more than 300,000 jin of raw material soybeans supplied by the state. There are many similar examples. This has caused the amount of grain supplied by the state to the industrial and commercial sectors to rise sharply month by month, breaking through the original plan. In August 1954, the amount of grain sold by the state to industrial and commercial sectors increased by about 7 percent compared with July, and in September it suddenly increased by more than 20 percent compared with August. This abnormal phenomenon continued to develop, and in March of this year it increased by 39.04 percent compared with August 1954. This situation seriously hinders the state from correctly implementing the grain supply plan, and farmers and urban residents also have opinions on this unreasonable phenomenon, and have demanded that the government take measures to strictly manage and stop various grain speculation and waste behaviors.
    Starting from the first quarter of this year, all towns and cities across the country have universally launched a grain saving campaign, and then rectified the grain unified sales work, and grain speculation and waste phenomena have been greatly reduced, and the false increase in the amount of grain used by the industrial and commercial sectors has been gradually compressed. According to statistics from eighteen provinces and cities, in May of this year, the national grain supply for industrial and commercial sectors decreased by 14.36 percent compared with April, and it continued to decrease in the following months. However, these temporary measures to adjust the supply volume cannot completely eliminate grain speculation and waste phenomena. Therefore, on the basis of rectifying the grain unified sales work, establishing a sound system and implementing rationing supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors by household is a timely and very necessary measure.
    How exactly does the state implement rationing supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors by household? Specifically speaking, it is: First, the grain used by industry and handicrafts should be planned by each production unit according to the local grain consumption quota standards and production plans, on a monthly and quarterly basis, and supplied after being reviewed and approved by the local People's Committee or its designated agency. Second, the grain used for winemaking should be planned by the monopoly business companies of each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government, and submitted to the People's Committee of the province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government or its designated agency for approval and supply; other grain used for brewing such as making sauce, vinegar, and soy sauce should be supplied according to the methods for industrial and handicraft grain use. Third, the grain used by the cooked food industry, reproduction industry, pastry industry, non-staple food industry, etc., should be planned by each business according to the normal needs of society and seasonal business conditions, on a monthly basis, and supplied after being reviewed and approved by the local People's Committee or its designated agency. Because the seasonal changes in the supply and demand of non-staple foods are very large, after the implementation of the grain rationing supply method, the implementation of the grain use plan for the non-staple food industry needs to be grasped by the local commercial authorities according to the seasonal supply and demand situation. In the peak season of vegetable marketing, the supply of grain for non-staple foods will be reduced; in the off-season of vegetable marketing, the supply of grain for non-staple foods will be appropriately increased. In this way, the needs of consumers can be guaranteed, and the interests of vegetable farmers can be protected and grain can be saved. The state, according to the characteristics of different grain-using industries in industry and commerce, specifies specific methods and procedures for rationing supply by household according to different situations, which is practical. In the current process of rationing supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors by household, the state will refer to the past actual grain use situation and operating conditions of grain-using businesses, widely solicit opinions from all relevant parties, and determine the amount of grain used by each business. Therefore, each grain-using business should compile grain use plans with a realistic attitude, and any behavior of falsely reporting the amount needed is wrong.
    Why is it necessary to strengthen the management of certain grain reproductions, cooked foods, and foods and non-staple foods made from grain? This is because after the implementation of rationing supply of residents' rations and grain for industrial and commercial sectors, if certain grain-made products are not required to be purchased with grain coupons, the phenomenon of repeated purchases will continue to occur as in the past, and may even cause chaotic situations such as panic buying, trafficking, and price increases, which will affect the stability of the market. In order to ensure the normal supply of the market, the state stipulates that all foods that are mainly grain-based and can replace ration consumption, such as rice and pasta sold by the cooked food industry and noodles, cut noodles, rice noodles, rice cakes, etc. sold by the reproduction industry, residents and transient populations should eat or purchase with grain coupons. This is an essential and important measure to implement the grain rationing supply method.
    What are the benefits of implementing rationing supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors by household and strengthening the management of grain-made products? The most important thing is that it can overcome grain waste, block loopholes in grain supply, and promote grain saving. After the implementation of rationing by household, grain-using businesses can further reduce the amount of grain used by improving production technology and researching the use of substitutes, thereby reducing production costs. After the rationing supply of grain by household, state-owned and joint state-private cotton textile factories in Shanghai City promoted methods to reduce cotton yarn sizing while ensuring quality, saving more than 2 million jin of grain every year. The Zhangzhou Winery, a local state-owned enterprise in Fujian Province, plans to use a large amount of papaya, bayberry, and other fruits for winemaking, which is estimated to save 240,000 jin of grain every month. In the grain used by industrial and commercial sectors, the proportion of grain used by industries that operate various foods is the largest (accounting for about three-fifths), so after the implementation of the method of eating or purchasing certain grain-made products with grain coupons, the amount of waste, repurchase, and private sale of grain reduced is also huge. Everyone knows that saving more grain for the state can replenish the state's grain sources, ensure the grain supply of towns and cities and people lacking grain, and ensure the victory of the country's socialist construction cause.
    In the process of implementing rationing supply of grain for industrial and commercial sectors by household and strengthening the management of grain-made products, the state can correctly guide grain-using businesses to improve business management, help them overcome the decentralization and blindness in production and operation, and actively promote the socialist transformation of private grain-using industries.
    Industrial and commercial households that use grain as raw materials or auxiliary materials and urban residents should recognize the benefits of the grain rationing supply measure, consciously abide by government decrees, and fight against all lawbreakers who undermine the grain rationing supply work, and actively assist in the smooth implementation of this measure.

    作好市镇粮食定量供应工作
    杜绝工商行业用粮中的浪费和投机行为
    刘朝正
    实行粮食定量供应办法以后，用粮食作原料或辅助材料的工商行业需用的粮食须由各业户编制用粮计划，经过审核批准后进行供应。同时，熟食业出售的米饭、面食和复制业出售的挂面、切面、米粉、年糕等，无论居民或流动人口都要凭地方粮票或全国通用粮票食用或购买。
    用粮食作原料或辅助材料的工商行业，所生产或经营的商品种类复杂，需用粮食的品种繁多，耗用数量也相当大。据天津市今年七月份初步调查，全市经营食品的行业就有九千五百二十一户，经营食品三百多种，全月用粮一千多万斤。在许多交通要冲和集镇，因旅客、商贩、农民等来往频繁，经营饮食业的户数很多。据四川省调查，农村集镇的饮食业户一般约占集镇工商总户数的一半左右。工商行业用粮的供应面广，数量大，涉及人民经济生活的许多方面。实行工商行业用粮的按户定量供应和主要粮食复制品凭票食用或购买的办法，不仅直接关系到用粮食作原料或辅助材料的工商行业的生产和经营，而且对于节约粮食、杜绝浪费和投机，保证城乡人民的消费需要，促进城乡互助，都有重要作用。
    两年来，国家实行了工商行业用粮的计划供应。但是，由于许多地区粮食机关对工商行业用粮计划没有掌握，没有严格地、认真地进行检查、管理，以致工商用粮行业中普遍有浮报需粮数量、浪费、投机牟利、套购、囤积、倒卖等非法行为。例如，兰州市曾发现面饭业谎报营业额，虚报用粮数量高达六倍多；南昌市豆豉业曾将国家供应的原料大豆倒卖三十多万斤。类似的例子很多。这就使得国家供应工商行业用粮的数量逐月猛升，突破了原定计划。一九五四年八月份国家售出的工商行业用粮比七月份增加百分之七左右，九月份又比八月份突增百分之二十以上。这种反常现象一直继续发展，今年三月份竟比一九五四年八月份增加了百分之三十九点零四。这种情况严重地妨碍着国家正确地执行粮食供应计划，而且农民和市镇居民群众对这种不合理的现象也有意见，纷纷要求政府采取措施严格管理，制止各种粮食投机和浪费行为。
    从今年第一季度开始，全国各市镇普遍开展了节约粮食运动，并接着整顿了粮食统销工作，粮食投机和浪费现象大为减少，工商行业用粮的虚假上升数量才被逐渐压缩下来。据十八个省、市统计，今年五月份全国工商行业用粮供应量比四月份降低百分之十四点三六，以后几个月还续有减少。但是，这种调整供应量的临时措施，还不能彻底消除粮食投机和浪费现象。因此，在整顿粮食统销工作的基础上，确立健全的制度，实行工商行业用粮按户定量供应，是切合时宜的、非常必要的措施。
    国家对工商行业用粮究竟怎样实行按户定量供应呢？具体说来，就是：第一、工业、手工业用粮，要由各生产单位根据当地规定的粮食消耗定额标准和生产计划，按月份、季度编制用粮计划，经当地人民委员会或其指定机关审核批准后，然后予以供应。第二、酿酒用粮，要由各省、自治区、直辖市专卖事业公司编制用粮计划，送省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会或其指定机关批准供应；其他制作酱、醋、酱油等酿造用粮，要按工业、手工业用粮办法予以供应。第三、熟食业、复制业、糕点业、副食品等行业用粮，由各业户根据社会的正常需要和季节营业情况，编制按月用粮计划，经当地人民委员会或其指定机关审核批准后予以供应。由于副食品供应和需要的季节性变化很大，在实行粮食定量供应办法以后，副食品行业用粮计划的执行需要由各地商业机关根据季节性的供求情况加以掌握，在蔬菜上市旺季，就减少副食品用粮的供应；在蔬菜上市淡季，就适当增加副食品用粮的供应。这样，既可保证消费者的需要，又可保护菜农利益和节约粮食。国家根据工商不同用粮行业的特点，分别情况规定按户定量供应的具体办法和程序，是切合实际的。国家在现行工商行业用粮按户定量供应过程中，将参考用粮各业户过去的实际用粮情况和经营条件，广泛征询各有关方面的意见，确定各业户的用粮数量。因此，各用粮业户应该用实事求是的态度来编制用粮计划，任何虚报需用量的行为都是错误的。
    为什么要加强对某些粮食复制品熟食品和用粮食制成的食品、副食品的管理呢？这是因为在实行居民口粮和工商行业用粮定量供应以后，如果不对某些粮食制成品规定凭粮票购买，这就会跟过去一样，继续发生重复购买的现象，甚至还可能造成抢购、贩运、抬价等混乱情况，结果就会影响市场的稳定。国家为了保证市场的正常供应，规定凡是以粮食为主、能够代替口粮消费的食品如熟食业出售的米饭、面食和复制业出售的挂面、切面、米粉、年糕等，居民和流动人口应凭粮票食用或购买。这是贯彻执行粮食定量供应办法的必不可少的重要措施。
    实行工商行业用粮按户定量供应和加强粮食制成品的管理的好处是什么呢？最重要的是能够克服粮食浪费，堵塞粮食供应中的漏洞，推动节约粮食。实行按户定量后，用粮业户就可进一步在改进生产技术、研究使用代用品等方面减少用粮数量，从而降低生产成本。上海市全市国营和公私合营棉纺织厂在粮食按户定量供应后，在保证质量的前提下，推行减低棉纱上浆办法，每年可节约粮食二百多万斤。福建省地方国营漳州酿酒厂准备大量采用木瓜、杨梅等酿酒，估计每月可节约粮食二十四万斤。在工商行业用粮中，以经营各种食品的行业用粮所占比重最大（约占五分之三），因而实行某些粮食制成品凭粮票食用或购买办法后，所减少的浪费、重购和私贩粮食数量也是巨大的。谁都知道，给国家节约更多的粮食，就能够充裕国家粮源，保证市镇和缺粮人民的粮食供应和国家的社会主义建设事业的胜利进行。
    在实行工商行业用粮按户定量供应和加强对粮食制成品的管理过程中，国家可以正确地指导用粮业户改善经营管理，帮助它们克服生产和经营上的分散性和盲目性，积极地推动对私营用粮行业的社会主义改造。
    用粮食作原料或辅助材料的工商业户和市镇居民应该认识粮食定量供应这一措施的好处，自觉地遵守政府法令，并同各种破坏粮食定量供应工作的不法分子进行斗争，积极地协助这一措施的顺利实行。
