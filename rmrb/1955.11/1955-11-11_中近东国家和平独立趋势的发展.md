The current development of the situation in the Middle East has aroused widespread attention. On the one hand, imperialist countries are using the Baghdad Pact, which they created, to promote colonial policies and war plans, wanting to keep the Middle Eastern countries under foreign rule forever. On the other hand, the national consciousness of the Middle Eastern countries is awakening day by day, and they are determined to completely get rid of imperialist control and interference, and take the road of peace and independence. This trend is becoming more and more obvious. It has become a new factor of great significance in the international situation.

The development of the trend of peace and independence of the Middle Eastern countries is first manifested in their attitude towards Western military groups. These countries see that joining Western military groups means handing over their territory, resources, and sovereignty to the control of Western powers, and linking their fate with the war adventures of international aggressor groups. This is obviously fundamentally incompatible with the desire for national independence and peace. Therefore, for many years, the plan of Western countries, headed by the United States, to establish military groups in the Middle East has always been resisted and opposed by the Middle Eastern countries. Despite the United States' efforts to exert pressure on these countries, most Middle Eastern countries, except Turkey, Iraq, and Iran, insist on refusing to participate in such military groups. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser said when talking about such military groups: "Egypt will not participate in any alliance or military treaty concluded with major powers, because it means war, and we don't want war." He also said that Arab countries are unwilling to participate in the "Middle East Defense Organization" combined with Western countries, because such an organization is "colonialism in disguise."

The situation in Turkey is a vivid example. Turkey joined Western military groups the earliest, and suffered the deepest as a result. Its entire territory has become a foreign military base, its national sovereignty has been seriously infringed upon, and its financial economy is deteriorating. All of this has brought a profound national crisis to Turkey. In international affairs, Turkey's position has also been greatly reduced. Because of this, even in countries like Turkey, voices demanding a change in the current policy have begun to appear. The Istanbul "Republican Newspaper" wrote that the world is now blowing the "wind of agreement," "At such a time, we should also consider how our country should be in step with everyone and what measures should be taken for this."

Obviously, the way out for the Middle Eastern countries is definitely not to participate in Western military groups, but to implement an independent and autonomous policy, and strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation between the Middle Eastern countries, so as to safeguard the national interests of the countries and the peace of the Middle East region. In this regard, countries such as Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia have set a good example. On October 20, Egypt and Syria signed a treaty of alliance. On October 27, Egypt and Saudi Arabia signed a defense treaty. This is a major political event in the Middle East. Its significance lies in the fact that these two treaties were not participated in by Western countries, but were regional alliances established on the basis of equality by independent and autonomous Middle Eastern countries for common interests. These two treaties are in sharp contrast to the Baghdad Pact created by Western countries. It fully conforms to the principles stipulated in the Charter of the United Nations and the Bandung Conference Declaration, and greatly helps to stabilize the situation in the Middle East. There is no doubt that the development of this independent and autonomous diplomatic activity will have a profound impact on the Middle East.

Middle Eastern countries are not only working hard to strengthen their solidarity and mutual assistance, but are also strengthening friendly exchanges and international cooperation with countries around the world. After the Bandung Conference, Indian Prime Minister Nehru visited Egypt. In the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of India and Egypt, the importance of friendly contacts between countries was particularly emphasized. Recently, Saudi Arabian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Faisal Saud also said: "We should strengthen relations with all countries." In the near future, Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser will visit the Soviet Union, and Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Bulganin and Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Khrushchev will also visit Afghanistan. These events and news have been valued and praised by international public opinion. Similarly, the Soviet-Yemeni Friendship Treaty signed on October 31 has also been welcomed by peace-loving people. This treaty fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's respect for Yemen's national independence and sovereignty, and greatly promotes the development of friendly relations between the two countries. All this has brought fresh air of peace to the Middle East.

In order to promote international cooperation, trade exchanges between Middle Eastern countries and countries around the world are developing day by day. Western countries have always monopolized and restricted the foreign trade of these countries as a tool for their economic plunder and political interference. However, with the development of the trend of peace and independence of the Middle Eastern countries, this artificial barrier has begun to crack. Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries have developed trade relations with the Soviet Union and China, and have opened up broad prospects. Egypt's "Cairo Newspaper" wrote in a commentary on Sino-Egyptian trade: "Now, Egypt can freely sell its cotton to any buyer." The report of the Egyptian economic delegation to the Soviet Union also pointed out that Egypt's "highest interests require increased trade with these countries."

Recently, Egypt's agreement to exchange arms for cotton and rice with Czechoslovakia is also a part of this normal international trade activity. This independent and autonomous action of Egypt has caused great unease in the United States, and the United States has come forward to threaten Egypt, wanting to "cancel" this agreement. This is of course not surprising. For a long time, the United States has been provoking and dividing Middle Eastern countries on the one hand, and using "military aid" to manipulate these countries on the other hand. Because of this, the signing of the Egyptian-Czech trade agreement is of great significance. It is worth noting that all Arab countries, including Iraq, unanimously support Egypt's actions, because it reflects the common desire of Arab countries to get rid of foreign influence. At the same time, Egypt's actions also help to promote peaceful coexistence among countries. Egyptian Deputy Minister of the Army and Navy Hassani Ragab said correctly that the Egyptian-Czech agreement is setting "a moderate and practical example that can be followed by other countries, showing that coexistence is not a very difficult thing to achieve after all in our world."

The result of the implementation of a policy of peace and independence by Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries has significantly improved their international status. Middle Eastern countries are playing an increasingly active role in international affairs. This situation is also reflected in the Tenth United Nations General Assembly. There, Middle Eastern countries, together with other Asian and African countries, solemnly condemned the colonial system, strongly supported the struggle of the North African people for national independence, and the demands of some Asian countries to safeguard territorial sovereignty.

The development of the trend of peace and independence of the Middle Eastern countries is the result of the rising national independence movement of the people of all countries in the region, and it is also a reflection of the increasing disintegration of the imperialist colonial system. It marks a change in the historical face of the Middle East. This point is even acknowledged by some bourgeois newspapers in Western countries. Paris "International Forum" wrote on October 7: "Arab countries are increasingly inclined to play a completely new role internationally. Western countries will soon feel the 'reality of the new Middle East'." Recently, the US "Foreign Policy Association Bulletin" is also exclaiming "the rise of countries without status"!

As everyone knows, the Middle East is located between Asia, Europe and Africa, with an extremely important geographical location and abundant natural resources. This has always been the object of colonial expansion and plunder by Western countries, and also an important arena for their struggle for world hegemony. In the eyes of imperialists, the Middle East only means cotton, oil, military bases, and cheap labor. They have never recognized the national sovereignty and international status of the Middle Eastern countries. Curzon, who was once the British Foreign Secretary, wrote before the First World War: The Middle Eastern countries "in my opinion, are all pawns on the chessboard, and a game of dominating the world is being played on this chessboard." After the Second World War, the United States' power extended greatly into the Middle East, and it held the same traditional imperialist view. American reactionary commentator Lippmann said: "The national sovereignty of the countries in the Near East and the Middle East is nothing but empty talk on paper." Moreover, until recently, some American newspapers openly referred to the Middle Eastern countries as "pawns" "within the sphere of influence of the West." The "New York Times" even showed the imperialist prestige to the Middle Eastern countries, saying that Egypt's independent and autonomous action was equivalent to plucking "the feathers of the American eagle" and twisting "the tail of the British lion," which seemed unimaginable.... But, as everyone sees, history is not developing according to the arrogant dreams of imperialism after all. Today's reality proves this even more. Those who refuse to admit reality are bound to stumble.

Whether Western countries are willing or unwilling, the development of the trend of peace and independence of the Middle Eastern countries is unstoppable. The people of the Middle Eastern countries cannot allow imperialism to treat them as "pawns" again, and they are determined to be the masters of their own countries and destinies. The people of the Middle Eastern countries cannot allow imperialism to turn the Middle East into a hotbed for launching wars again, and they are determined to turn this region into a region of peace. This desire fully conforms to the interests of the people of all countries in the world, and it also fully conforms to the historical development process of the Middle East, so it will definitely be realized.

　　中近东国家和平独立趋势的发展
　　崔奇
    目前，中近东形势的发展，引起人们的广泛注意。一方面，帝国主义国家正在利用它们所制造的巴格达条约，推行殖民政策和战争计划，想把中近东国家永远放在外国统治之下。另一方面，中近东国家的民族意识日益觉醒，它们决心彻底摆脱帝国主义的控制和干涉，走和平与独立的道路。这种趋势是越来越明显了。它已成为国际形势中具有重要意义的一个新因素。
    中近东国家和平独立趋势的发展，首先表现在它们对待西方军事集团的态度上。这些国家看到，参加西方军事集团，就意味着把自己的领土、资源和主权交给西方大国控制，并且把自己的命运和国际侵略集团的战争冒险连在一起。这显然是同民族独立与和平的愿望根本不相容的。因此，多年以来，以美国为首的西方国家在中近东建立军事集团的计划，始终遭到中近东国家的抵制和反对。尽管美国想尽一切办法，不断地对这些国家施加压力，但是现在除了土耳其、伊拉克和伊朗以外，大部分中近东国家坚持拒绝参加这种军事集团。埃及总理纳赛尔在谈到这种军事集团时说：“埃及将不参加任何同大国缔结的联盟或军事条约，因为它意味着战争，而我们不要战争。”他又说过，阿拉伯国家不愿意参加同西方国家结合起来的“中东防御组织”，因为这样一个组织“只是伪装下的殖民主义”。
    土耳其的情况就是一个生动的例证。土耳其参加西方军事集团最早，结果受害也最深。它的整个国土已变为外国的军事基地，民族主权遭到严重侵犯，财政经济日益恶化。所有这些，给土耳其带来了深重的民族危机。在国际事务中，土耳其的地位也大为降低。正因为这样，即使在土耳其这样的国家里，也开始出现要求改变现行政策的呼声。伊斯坦布尔“共和报”写道，现在世界上正吹着“协议的风”，“在这样的时候，我们也应该考虑我们国家要怎样同大家取得一致步调和应该为此而采取怎样的措施。”
    很显然，中近东国家的出路决不是参加西方军事集团，而是执行独立自主的政策，并加强中近东国家之间的互助合作，以维护各国的民族利益和中近东地区的和平。在这一方面，埃及、叙利亚和沙特阿拉伯等国已经做出了良好的榜样。十月二十日，埃及和叙利亚签订了联盟条约。十月二十七日，埃及和沙特阿拉伯又签订了防御条约。这是中近东的重大政治事件。它的意义在于：这两个条约是没有西方国家参加的，而是中近东的独立自主国家，在平等的基础上，为了共同的利益建立的区域性联盟。这两个条约同西方国家所制造的巴格达条约适成对照。它完全符合联合国宪章和万隆会议宣言所规定的原则，并大大有助于稳定中近东的局势。毫无疑问，这种独立自主的外交活动的发展，将在中近东产生深远影响。
    中近东国家不仅努力加强它们之间的团结互助，而且也在加强同世界各国之间的友好往来与国际合作。万隆会议以后，印度总理尼赫鲁访问了埃及。在印埃两国总理的联合声明中，特别强调了各国之间进行友好接触的重要意义。最近，沙特阿拉伯首相兼外交大臣费萨尔·沙特也表示：“我们应该加强同一切国家的关系。”不久将来，埃及总理纳赛尔将访问苏联，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁和最高苏维埃主席团委员赫鲁晓夫也将访问阿富汗。这些事件和消息，已受到国际舆论的重视和赞扬。同样地，十月三十一日签订的苏联—也门友好条约，也受到爱好和平人民的欢迎。这个条约充分表现了苏联对也门的民族独立和主权的尊重，并且大大促进了两国之间友好关系的发展。所有这一切都给中近东带来了新鲜的和平空气。
    为了促进国际合作，中近东国家和世界各国之间的贸易交流正日益开展。西方国家一向垄断和限制这些国家的对外贸易，以作为它们进行经济掠夺和政治干涉的工具。但是，随着中近东国家和平独立趋势的发展，这种人为的藩篱已经开始破裂了。埃及等中近东国家同苏联、中国的贸易关系有了发展，并且开辟了广阔的前途。埃及“开罗报”在评论中埃贸易时写道：“现在，埃及可以自由地把它的棉花出售给任何买主了。”埃及经济代表团访苏报告中也指出，埃及的“最高利益要求同这些国家增加交易”。
    最近，埃及用棉花大米同捷克斯洛伐克交换军火的协定，也就是这种正常国际贸易活动的一部分。埃及这个独立自主的行动，引起了美国的极大不安，美国竟出面威胁埃及，想要“取消”这个协定。这当然并不奇怪。长期以来，美国就一边对中近东国家进行挑拨和分化，一边利用“军事援助”来摆布这些国家。正因为这样，埃捷贸易协定的签订，就具有十分重大的意义。值得注意的是，包括伊拉克在内的全部阿拉伯国家都一致支持埃及的行动，因为它反映了阿拉伯国家要求摆脱外国影响的共同心情。同时，埃及这个行动也有助于促进各国之间的和平共处。埃及陆海军部副部长哈萨尼·拉加布说得对，埃捷协定正在树立“一个可为其他国家所效法的适度而实际的榜样，说明共处在我们的世界中毕竟不是一种非常难以实现的事”。
    埃及等中近东国家执行和平独立政策的结果，已使它们的国际地位显著提高了。中近东国家在国际事务中正起着越来越大的积极作用。这种情况也反映到第十届联合国大会上。在那里，中近东国家和其他亚非国家一起，严正地谴责了殖民制度，有力地支持了北非人民争取民族独立的斗争和亚洲一些国家维护领土主权的要求。
    中近东国家和平独立趋势的发展，是这个地区各国人民争取民族独立运动日益高涨的结果，也是帝国主义殖民制度日益瓦解的反映。它标志着中近东历史面貌的变化。这一点，就是西方国家的某些资产阶级报刊也不得不承认。巴黎“国际论坛”十月七日写道：“阿拉伯国家越来越倾向于在国际上发挥完全新的作用。西方国家很快就会感觉到‘新中东的现实’。”最近，美国“外交政策协会会报”也在惊呼“没有地位的国家兴起”了！
    大家知道，中近东介于欧亚非三洲之间，有着极其重要的地理地位和丰饶的天然资源。这里一直就是西方国家进行殖民扩张和掠夺的对象，也是它们之间争夺世界霸权的重要角逐场。在帝国主义者眼中，中近东不过意味着棉花、石油、军事基地和廉价劳动力，他们从来不承认中近东国家的民族主权和国际地位。曾经做过英国外相的寇松在第一次世界大战前写道：中近东国家“在我看来，都是棋盘上的棋子，这个棋盘上正在走着一场统治世界的棋”。第二次世界大战以后，美国势力大肆伸入中近东，它同样是抱着这种传统的帝国主义观点的。美国反动政论家李普曼说：“近东及中东诸国的国家主权，不过是纸上空谈。”而且，直到最近，美国某些报纸还公开把中近东国家称为“西方势力范围之内”的“小卒”。“纽约时报”甚至向中近东国家摆帝国主义的威风说，埃及的独立自主行动等于拔了“美国鹫鹰的羽毛”，扭了“英国狮子的尾巴”，似乎是不可设想的事……。但是，大家看到，历史毕竟不是按照帝国主义的狂妄梦想而发展的。今天的现实更加证明了这一点。不肯承认现实的人是一定要跌跤的。
    不管西方国家愿意不愿意，中近东国家和平独立趋势的发展是不可阻挡的。中近东各国人民不能容许帝国主义再把他们当作“棋子”，他们决心要做自己国家和命运的主人。中近东各国人民不能容许帝国主义再把中近东作为发动战争的策源地，他们决心要把这个地区变为和平的地区。这种愿望完全符合世界各国人民的利益，也完全符合中近东的历史发展进程，因此它一定会实现的。
