　　A large number of the fifty-two new and expanded factories and mines in Fujian Province this year have been put into production. It is estimated that forty-eight factories and mines will be put into production by the end of the year.
　　Among the new and expanded machine factories in Fujian this year are six factories in Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Fuan, and Yong'an. After they are put into production, they will manufacture and repair threshers, water pumps, new-style plows, etc. in large quantities to support the agricultural cooperation movement. The joint state-private Zhangzhou Machine Factory, which has only recently been put into production, can produce more than 3,000 threshers and some water pumps, new-style plows, etc. every year. The local state-owned Quanzhou Machine Factory has doubled its production capacity after expansion this year. In addition to producing new-style agricultural implements such as threshers, it will also produce new-style and improved agricultural implements such as animal-powered waterwheels suitable for farmers in southern Fujian. The first modern cement plant, which has recently been completed, will soon be put into production. In addition to fully meeting the needs of Fujian Province's industrial, agricultural, transportation infrastructure and civil construction, some of the cement produced can also be used for the construction of the Yingtan-Xiamen Railway.

　  福建一批新厂矿投入生产
    福建省今年新建和扩建的五十二个厂矿，到目前为止，已大部分投入生产，估计到年底，将有四十八个厂矿可以投入生产。
    今年福建新建、扩建的机器厂有泉州、漳州、福安、永安等六个厂，投入生产后将大量制造和修理打谷机、抽水机、新式步犁等，支援农业合作化运动。仅投入生产不久的公私合营漳州机器厂，每年就可以生产三千多台打谷机和部分抽水机、新式步犁等。地方国营泉州机器厂今年扩建后，生产能力扩大了一倍左右，除能生产打谷机等新式农具外，还将生产适合闽南农民用的畜力水车等新式农具和改良农具。最近已建设完工的第一座近代化的水泥厂，不久也可以投入生产，所产水泥除能充分供应福建省工业、农业、运输业基本建设和民用建筑需要外，并有部分可以供应修筑鹰厦铁路用。
