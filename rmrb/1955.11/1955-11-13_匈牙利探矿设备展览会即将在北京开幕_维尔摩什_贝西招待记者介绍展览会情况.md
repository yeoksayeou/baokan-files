Xinhua News Agency, December 12th: The Hungarian Prospecting Equipment Exhibition delegation leader, Vilmos Bessi, held a press conference in Beijing on the morning of December 12th.

At the press conference, Bessi introduced the Hungarian Prospecting Equipment Exhibition, which is about to open in Beijing.

Bessi said that the purpose of this exhibition is to familiarize Chinese friends and experts with the methods and equipment used in Hungarian geological exploration work. Another purpose of the exhibition is to obtain opinions from Chinese friends and experts on the exploration equipment and methods displayed.

Among the geological exploration equipment, Bessi introduced the seismograph manufactured in Hungary and its usage. He said that with the help of this instrument, especially in petroleum exploration, good results can be obtained. The gravity surveying method for exploring raw materials is mostly carried out using the Eötvös torsion balance, which is named after the Hungarian physicist Loránd Eötvös. In most parts of Hungary, the gravity Eötvös torsion balance is used for exploration; most of the Hungarian oil-bearing structures and recently exploited oil fields were measured by the Eötvös torsion balance. Bessi told reporters that in 1954, Hungary produced the latest and best torsion balance of all types.

Bessi said that in exploration work, Hungary also applied geoelectric methods, geothermal methods, and geochemical prospecting methods. This method has achieved good results in determining the basic mountain formation in an area with new thick alluvium. The automatic equipment for borehole electrical logging manufactured in Hungary has met expectations in all aspects and has made a great contribution to Hungarian deep drilling work. Hungary has integrated the drilling experience gained over the past decades and uses "water drill" equipment extensively to drill freshwater wells.

Bessi finally said that during the exhibition of Hungarian prospecting equipment in Beijing, the Hungarian prospecting equipment exhibition delegation will give more than ten reports to Chinese friends introducing Hungarian exploration work, and will also prepare to go to relevant areas in China to conduct on-site tests in coal and oil, and exchange experience in exploration work between Hungary and China.

　　匈牙利探矿设备展览会即将在北京开幕
　　维尔摩什·贝西招待记者介绍展览会情况
    新华社十二日讯　匈牙利探矿设备展览会代表团团长维尔摩什·贝西十二日上午在北京举行记者招待会。
    贝西在这个记者招待会上介绍了即将在北京开幕的匈牙利探矿设备展览会。
    贝西说，这个展览会的目的，是使中国朋友和专家们熟悉匈牙利地质勘探工作的方法和勘探设备。这个展览会的另一个目的，是在取得中国朋友和专家们对这次展出的勘探设备和使用方法的意见。
    在地质勘探设备中，贝西介绍了匈牙利制造的地震仪和它的使用方法。他说，利用这种仪器的帮助，尤其是在石油勘探方面，可以得到很好的效果。勘探原料的重力测探法大多是用埃特屋斯扭秤进行，这个扭秤是因匈牙利物理学家罗兰得·埃特屋斯而得名的。在匈牙利的大部分地方，是用重力的埃特屋斯扭秤来勘查的；大多数的匈牙利储油构造和最近开采的油田都是由埃特屋斯扭秤测量出来的。贝西告诉记者，在一九五四年，匈牙利又制出了最新式的也是历来各式扭秤中最好的扭秤。
    贝西说，在勘查工作中，匈牙利还应用了地电法、地温法和化探法。这个方法在确定一个有新厚冲积物地区里的基性山构成情况方面得到很好的成效。匈牙利所制钻井电测用的自动设备在各方面都达到了期望，对于匈牙利深钻工作有很大的贡献。匈牙利集成了过去数十年所得到的钻井经验，大量地使用“水钻”设备来钻淡水井。
    贝西最后说，匈牙利探矿设备展览会在北京展出期间，匈牙利探矿设备展览会代表团将向中国朋友们作十多次介绍匈牙利勘探工作的报告，并且准备到中国有关地区去进行煤和石油等方面的实地试验，交流匈中两国勘探工作的经验。
