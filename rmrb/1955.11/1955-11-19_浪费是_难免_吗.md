Is Waste "Inevitable"?

　　The local state-owned Yantai Cannery has suffered significant waste due to chaotic enterprise management. For example, in the second quarter of this year, when the factory produced apricot and peach canned goods, it did not consider how to solve the difficulties of producing new products beforehand, nor did it solve the storage problem well, but blindly purchased large quantities. As a result, more than 164,000 jin of apricots and peaches were devalued and sold due to non-compliance with specifications and rot, wasting more than 26,700 yuan.

　　Much of the waste in this factory is repeated because it does not accept lessons well. In April of this year, the factory decided to increase its original output of 6,500 cans of canned goods per day to more than 10,000 cans. Because it simply pursued quantity, the meat was cut unevenly and not cooked thoroughly, resulting in canned meat with excessive moisture and insufficient weight, resulting in fines from the processing unit. Later, they went to another extreme, extending the cooking time when cooking the meat, and failing to turn it over on time, cooking all the fat into oil. This resulted in a waste of 5,500 jin of pork.

　　What attitude did the factory leaders take towards this kind of waste? They did not conduct a good inspection, but emphasized that "waste is inevitable in this line of work" to cover up the shortcomings in their work. In fact, this kind of waste is by no means "inevitable". The problem is that the leaders of this factory lack a sense of responsibility for state property and adopt an incorrect attitude towards thrift.

### 浪费是“难免”吗

　　浪费是“难免”吗
    地方国营烟台罐头厂由于企业管理混乱，造成了很大的浪费。比如，今年第二季度该厂生产杏子和桃子罐头时，事前没有考虑如何解决生产新产品的困难，也没有很好解决储藏问题，只是盲目地大量收购。结果，因杏、桃不合规格和因霉烂而贬值出售的就有十六万四千多斤，浪费了两万六千七百多元。
    该厂很多浪费都是因为不很好接受教训而重复发生的。今年四月份，厂里决定将原来日产罐头六千五百罐的产量提高到一万罐以上，因单纯追求数量，肉切得不匀，煮得不到火口，致使罐头肉水分过大、份量不足，结果受到加工单位的罚款。以后他们又走了另外一个极端，在煮肉时延长时间，不按时翻动，把肥肉都煮得化成油了。这样，又造成五千五百斤猪肉的浪费。
    对待这种浪费现象，厂的领导人员采取什么态度呢？他们没有很好进行检查，却强调“干这行浪费难免”，来掩饰工作中的缺点。其实，这种浪费决不是“难免”的。问题在于：这个厂的领导人员对国家资财缺乏责任感，对节约采取错误的态度。
