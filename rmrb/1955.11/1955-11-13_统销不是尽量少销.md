Title: Unified Sales Are Not About Selling As Little As Possible

According to September statistics, the Gansu Province Oils Company only completed 42% of its annual sales plan. Is it because the company doesn't have cooking oil? No. Is it because farmers don't need cooking oil? No, it isn't. In Linxia County, there was a farmer who was going to hold a wedding. According to the "special oil use" regulations, he could buy ten jin of oil according to his needs. However, the application slip to buy ten jin of oil was reduced to five jin by the township cadre. When it reached the district, the district cadre "grasped" the spirit of the unified sales policy even more tightly, and cut it down by another four jin. However, even the district's approval didn't count, as the final authority rested with the supply and marketing cooperative. Sometimes, if four jin were approved, only one jin was sold; sometimes, if one jin was approved, only four liang were sold. This year, during the National Day celebrations, the Provincial People's Committee stipulated an increase in the supply of cooking oil by six liang per person. However, this regulation may have been considered "too wasteful" by lower levels. Tongxin County revised this decision, increasing it by only three liang per person; Min County did it even more decisively, deciding not to increase it at all for farmers.

Perhaps, our comrades working in these grassroots organizations believe they are acting with good intentions, reducing the supply of cooking oil for the country. In reality, they have not truly understood the country's policy of unified purchase and sales, resulting in the opposite effect: not only have they failed to complete the country's cooking oil sales plan, but they have also damaged the unified sales policy and the government's credibility, causing dissatisfaction among the people.

    统销不是尽量少销
    据九月份的统计，甘肃省油脂公司只完成了全年销售计划的百分之四十二。是公司里没有食油吗？不是。是农民不需要食油吗？也不是。临夏县有一个农民，要办喜事，按照“特殊用油”的规定，他可以按照需用量买十斤。可是，申请买油十斤的条子，到了乡干部那里，一笔给减成五斤。到了区上，区干部对于统销政策的精神“掌握”得更紧了，又削减了四斤。然而，区上批的，也还不能算数，最后的大权在供销合作社。有时候，批下来四斤，只卖给一斤；有时候，批下来一斤，只卖给四两。今年，国庆节的时候，省人民委员会规定增加供应每人食油六两。可是，这个规定可能被下级认为“太浪费”了，同心县就修改了这个决定，每人只加三两；岷县办得更干脆，决定对农民一律不增加。
    也许，我们这些基层组织的工作同志，自以为是一片好心，给国家压缩了食油的供应量。其实，他们没有真正懂得国家的统购统销政策，结果适得其反：既没有完成国家的食油销售计划，又破坏了统销政策和政府的威信，引起人民群众的不满。
