The Chinese version of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issue 45, 1955, has been published.

This issue publishes the full text of Kaganovich's report at the Moscow meeting celebrating the 38th anniversary of the October Revolution on November 6 this year with extensive coverage, and reports on the grand celebrations of the October Revolution Day by the working people of the Soviet Union and countries around the world.

This issue contains the following articles: "Striving to Realize the Wishes of the Entire People - Changing the Government's Policies" by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; "Female Communist Party Members Struggle for the Revival of Italian Society" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party; "Socialism and Peace are Inseparable" by Nicolae Ceaușescu, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party; and "The Truth About the Soviet Union Reaches Various Latin American Countries" by Dionisio Encina, General Secretary of the Mexican Communist Party.

Thorez's article first analyzes the disastrous consequences of the domestic and foreign policies implemented by the French government, which run counter to the interests and peaceful aspirations of the French people. He then points out that the people of France are increasingly dissatisfied with the current rulers and their policies, and the cries of protest are growing louder. Therefore, the rulers are eagerly demanding early elections in an attempt to evade the accusations of the people of the country. Thorez said that there are forces in France sufficient to change the government's policies, and the current task is to unite all these forces. We must spare no effort to unite the entire working class and all democratic forces to realize the wishes of the people of the country—changing the government's policies.

Togliatti's article states that in 1945, the Italian Communist Party had 80,000 female members, and now there are 575,000. This force is a factor in reforming and revitalizing Italian society. In Italy, the women's liberation movement is gradually becoming, and has in fact become, a struggle: on the one hand, it is essentially a struggle for women's rights and a struggle for a new way of life; on the other hand, it is a struggle against poverty and for improving the lives of the broad masses of working people in urban and rural areas. These two aspects are combined, and they constitute the women's liberation movement, which is a major part of the common struggle for the democratic revival of Italian society. Therefore, the work of female Communist Party members and the entire party among the masses of working women is of particular significance. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
  　中文版一九五五年第四十五期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第四十五期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以大量篇幅全文刊载了卡冈诺维奇今年十一月六日在莫斯科十月革命三十八周年庆祝大会上的报告，并且报道了苏联和世界各国劳动人民庆祝十月革命节的盛况。
    这一期刊载的文章有：法国共产党总书记莫·多列士的“争取实现全国人民的愿望——改变政府的政策”，意大利共产党总书记帕·陶里亚蒂的“女共产党员为复兴意大利社会而斗争”，罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记尼·齐奥塞斯库的“社会主义同和平是不可分割的”和墨西哥共产党总书记迪·恩西那的“苏联的真实情况传到拉丁美洲各国”。
    多列士的文章首先分析了法国政府所执行的违背法国人民的利益和和平愿望的内政外交政策所引起的灾难性的后果。他接着指出，法国全国人民对于当前的统治者和他们执行的政策日益不满，抗议的呼声也越来越响亮。因此，统治者迫不及待地要求提前举行大选，企图规避全国人民对他们的指责。多列士说，法国存在着足以改变政府政策的力量，当前的任务就是要把所有这些力量团结起来。我们要不遗余力地团结整个工人阶级和一切民主力量，实现全国人民的愿望——改变政府的政策。
    陶里亚蒂的文章说，一九四五年意大利共产党有八万名女党员，现在已经有五十七万五千名。这支力量就是改革和复兴意大利社会的一个因素。在意大利，妇女解放运动渐渐成为而且实际上已经成为这样一种斗争：一方面，它在实质上是一种争取妇女权利的斗争，也是争取新的生活方式的斗争；另一方面，它是反对贫困、争取改善广大城乡劳动人民群众的生活的斗争。这两个方面是相结合的，它们构成妇女解放运动，而这个运动又是争取意大利社会的民主复兴的共同斗争中的主要部分。因此，女共产党员和全党在劳动妇女群众中的工作具有特别重大的意义。　（新华社）
