　  Shanghai Ships Large Quantities of Cotton Cloth to the Countryside
    The China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station is allocating large quantities of cotton cloth to the countryside. Recently, at the Shanghai Railway Station and wharves, every day there have been one or two dozen train cars and five or six hundred tons of ship space loaded with cotton cloth, being transported to primary markets all over the country. In the five days from October 26th to the end of the month alone, more than 5,000 tons of cotton cloth were shipped from Shanghai, an increase of 9 percent compared to the same period last year. In order to support Sichuan's sixth year of bumper harvest, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supplying Station, after consulting with the Yangtze River Shipping Bureau, increased the planned direct shipment by 1,000 tons of cotton cloth. These shipments began on October 27th in three batches and would arrive directly in Chongqing in fifteen days, shortening the transportation time by three days compared to transshipment in Hankou and other places. Hubei Province, which suffered severe flooding last year but reaped bumper harvests of both cotton and grain this year, has also had its cotton cloth supply increased three times in a row by this station, reaching more than 16 million yuan. The cotton clothing shipped from Shanghai to the Jingzhou Special District of Hubei in late October was equivalent to the total amount of goods purchased by this special district from Shanghai in the fourth quarter of last year.

　  上海调运大批棉布下乡
    中国花纱布公司上海采购供应站调拨大量棉布下乡。最近在上海车站和轮船码头上，每天都有一、二十个车皮，五、六百吨船位载着棉布，运到全国各地初级市场去。仅十月二十六日到月底的五天中，就从上海运出了棉布五千多吨，比去年同期增加了百分之九。上海采购供应站为了支持四川第六个年头的大丰收，经同长江航务局洽妥，在原计划外增加直放一千吨棉布的船位，于十月二十七日起分三批放行，十五天后，就可直达重庆，比在汉口等地中转要缩短三天运输时间。去年遭受严重水灾、今年棉粮均获丰收的湖北省，这个站也连续三次增加棉布供应量达一千六百多万元。十月下旬从上海运到湖北荆州专区的棉衣，就相当于这个专区去年第四季度在上海进货的总数。
