Polish industrial labor productivity has increased rapidly.

The increase in Poland's total industrial output during the Six-Year Plan period (1950-1955) was approximately 65 percent due to the increase in labor productivity. In 1954, labor productivity in Polish industry increased by 75 percent compared to pre-war levels, and by 170 percent compared to the first year after the war.

The increase in labor productivity is mainly due to the improvement of the technical level in the national economy. People's Poland has built hundreds of new industrial enterprises with high technical levels, and many old enterprises have undergone complete reconstruction, with greatly improved levels of mechanization and automation. In 1936, each worker used an average of 3,100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which increased to 5,200 kilowatt-hours in 1954.

The improvement of workers' technical skills and the increase in the number of engineers and technicians also contributed to the growth of labor productivity. In 1954, 450,000 workers in various industrial sectors participated in on-the-job training classes, an increase of 200,000 compared to 1952. From 1950 to 1954, more than 65,000 engineers and technicians joined industrial work, and the average number of engineers and technicians per thousand industrial workers increased from 69 to 109.

　　波工业劳动生产率迅速提高
    波兰工业总产量在六年计划期间（一九五○—一九五五年）的增长，约有百分之六十五是由于劳动生产率的提高得来的。一九五四年，波兰工业中的劳动生产率比战前提高了百分之七十五，比战后第一年提高了百分之一百七十。
    劳动生产率的提高主要是由于国民经济中技术水平的提高。人民波兰建设了数以百计的具有高度技术水平的新的工业企业，许多旧的企业经过了全部的改建，机械化和自动化水平大大提高了。一九三六年，每个工人一年使用的电力平均是三千一百度，一九五四年就增加到了五千二百度。
  工人技术水平的提高和工程师、技术人员数量的增加也促进了劳动生产率的增长。一九五四年，各个工业部门不脱离生产进工厂训练班学习的工人有四十五万人，比一九五二年增加了二十万。从一九五○年到一九五四年，有六万五千多名工程师和技术人员参加了工业工作，平均每一千名工业工作者中工程师和技术人员的数目由六十九名增加到一百零九名。
