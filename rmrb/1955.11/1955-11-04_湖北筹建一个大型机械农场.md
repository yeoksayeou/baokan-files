Hubei Province is preparing to build its first large-scale state-owned mechanized farm, mainly for cotton cultivation, in Zongkou, Qianjiang County. The farm plans to reclaim 100,000 mu of land, which has been barren for years due to the chaotic local water conservancy system and constant waterlogging. A huge drainage project is currently underway there, including dredging rivers and digging canals, totaling 1.2 million cubic meters of earthwork to be completed. As the drainage project progresses, 20,000 mu of land can be reclaimed this winter.

The agricultural workers, cadres, and some machinery and farm implements transferred to this farm are drawn from the original two state-owned mechanized farms in Hubei Province. (Yuan Jun)

    湖北筹建一个大型机械农场
    湖北省正在潜江县总口地方筹建第一个以种植棉花为主的大型国营机械农场。农场计划垦荒面积十万亩，这片土地是过去当地水利系统混乱以致常年受渍而荒废下来的。目前正在那里进行巨大的排水工程，包括疏通河流、开凿渠道等一共要完成土方一百二十万方。随着排水工程的进展，今冬将可以开荒两万亩。
    调给这个农场的农业工人、干部以及一部分机器和农具，是由湖北省原有的两个国营机械农场抽调出来的。（袁军）
