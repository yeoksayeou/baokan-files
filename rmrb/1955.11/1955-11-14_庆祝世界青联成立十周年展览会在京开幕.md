　　Exhibition Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Opens in Beijing
　　The exhibition celebrating the tenth anniversary of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, jointly sponsored by the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth, opened on the 11th at the art exhibition hall of the Chinese Artists Association.
    The exhibition displayed more than 100 pictures introducing the ten-year history of struggle of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and hundreds of gifts from the youth of 58 countries to the Chinese youth. The pictures on display demonstrated the significant contributions made by the World Federation of Democratic Youth over the past decade in striving for peace and strengthening friendship among youth from various countries, and in safeguarding national independence and youth rights. The pictures also introduced the grand occasion of the Fifth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship.
    Among the gifts presented to the Chinese youth by various countries on display in the exhibition hall were wheat harvested by the Communist Youth League of the Altai Krai of the Soviet Union during the first land reclamation campaign, parachutes captured by the heroic Vietnamese People's Army from the French colonial army, landscape paintings of the motherland's mountains and rivers made by Korean youth using tree bark, and a tank model presented by the Polish Army Song and Dance Ensemble to the Chinese People's Liberation Army.
    Among the gifts on display was an extremely ordinary woolen bag, a gift made for Chinese youth by a Spanish youth imprisoned for fighting for peace and democracy. The exhibits also included a piece of rubble left over from the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima, Japan, ten years ago, which was given to Chinese youth by Japanese youth in Warsaw to express their determination to oppose atomic weapons.
    Also on display in the exhibition hall was a gift personally knitted with woolen yarn by an American young doctor during the Fifth World Youth and Students Festival for Peace and Friendship to celebrate with the Chinese youth delegation, with the words woven on it: "Unite in learning, fight for peace and freedom."

　　庆祝世界青联成立十周年展览会在京开幕
　　中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合会共同举办的庆祝世界民主青年联盟成立十周年展览会十一日在中国美术家协会美术展览馆开幕。
    展览会展出了介绍世界民主青年联盟十年来斗争历史的一百多幅图片和五十八个国家的青年赠送给中国青年的几百件礼物。展出的图片表明了世界民主青年联盟十年来在争取和平和加强各国青年之间的友谊、维护民族独立和青年权利的斗争中所作的重大贡献。图片中还介绍了第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节的盛况。
    展览室陈列的各个国家赠送给中国青年的礼物中，有苏联阿尔泰边区共青团在第一次开荒中收获的麦子，有英勇的越南人民军缴获法国殖民军的降落伞，有朝鲜青年用树皮制作的祖国山河的风景画，还有波兰军队歌舞团赠给中国人民解放军的坦克模型。
    展出的礼物中有一个极普通的绒线袋，它是一个因争取和平民主而被囚禁在监狱中的西班牙青年为中国青年制作的礼品。展品中还有十年以前，日本广岛遭到原子弹袭击后遗留下来的一片瓦砾，这片瓦砾是日本青年在华沙送给中国青年的，以表示他们反对原子武器的决心。
    展览室里还陈列着一个美国青年医师在第五届世界青年与学生和平友谊联欢节中为了同中国青年代表团联欢，亲手用毛线织成的礼品，上面织着：“在学习中团结起来，为和平自由而斗争。”（新华社）
