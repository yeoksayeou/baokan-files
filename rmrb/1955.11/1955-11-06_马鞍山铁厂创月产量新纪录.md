    Ma'anshan Iron Works Sets New Monthly Output Record
    The state-owned Ma'anshan Iron Works' pig iron production in October set a new record since the plant was established, increasing by 13% compared to October of last year. The average effective volume of the blast furnace occupied per ton of pig iron smelted by the six small blast furnaces was reduced to 0.769 cubic meters. This has enabled the same blast furnace to produce more iron.
    In October, the consumption of coke by the six blast furnaces was lower than the operation plan, saving a total of 1,000 tons of coke. This significantly reduced the cost of pig iron, with steelmaking pig iron decreasing by 13 yuan per ton and foundry pig iron decreasing by more than 3 yuan per ton.

    马鞍山铁厂创月产量新纪录
    国营马鞍山铁厂十月份的生铁产量，创造建厂以来的最高纪录，比去年十月份的产量增加了百分之十三。六座小型高炉平均每炼一吨生铁所占用的高炉有效容积已降低到零点七六九立方公尺。这就使同样的高炉炼出了更多的铁。
    十月份，六座高炉焦炭的消耗比作业计划降低，共节约了一千吨焦炭。这就使生铁成本显著降低，炼钢生铁每吨降低了十三元，铸造生铁每吨降低了三元多。　（据新华社讯）
