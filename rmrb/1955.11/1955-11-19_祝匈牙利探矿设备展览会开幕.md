Congratulations on the Opening of the Hungarian Prospecting Equipment Exhibition
Xu Jie, Vice Minister of Geology, People's Republic of China

　　The Hungarian People's Republic Prospecting Equipment Exhibition opened in Beijing on the 18th. This is a specialized exhibition on geological exploration technology, which will showcase the advanced technical equipment used by the Hungarian People's Republic in geophysical exploration instruments, drilling machinery, oil production industry, and civil engineering for oil and other mineral exploration. Through this exhibition, we can more specifically recognize the brilliant achievements of the Hungarian People's Republic in science and technology related to mineral exploration, especially in geophysical prospecting, thereby further strengthening the efforts of our country's scientific workers to learn these advanced science and technologies. The Hungarian People's Republic has sent an expert delegation headed by Comrade Beši, Chairman of the Hungarian People's Republic Geological General Guidance Committee, to our country, who will give us a series of thematic reports on geological exploration during the exhibition, and will go to the field after the exhibition to demonstrate the use and operation methods of various equipment in the field. Their sincere and unreserved introduction of new scientific and technological achievements to our people fully demonstrates the profound brotherly friendship between China and Hungary. At present, our country is vigorously carrying out mineral exploration to meet the needs of national construction. The holding of this exhibition will play a significant role in improving the scientific and technological level of geological exploration in our country. We would like to express our warm welcome and heartfelt thanks with brotherly friendship to the holding of the exhibition and the enthusiastic work of the Hungarian experts!

　　Hungary is a country with a long history in geophysical prospecting work. The great Hungarian scientist Etvos successfully researched and created an instrument for gravity exploration—the Etvos torsion balance—in the previous century. Using this instrument, many geological structures hidden underground with large oil reserves have been found in many regions of Europe and the Americas. This precision instrument is still an important tool for geophysical exploration. Since the establishment of the Hungarian People's Republic, with the rapid development of socialist industrial construction, they have made great achievements in geophysical exploration, both in scientific research and practical exploration; especially the research and improvement of seismic exploration methods have made the seismic exploration instruments manufactured in Hungary concentrate the advantages of similar instruments in other countries and overcome their shortcomings. In areas where seismic exploration cannot be carried out smoothly, many improvements have been made to the working methods of seismic exploration, and satisfactory results have also been achieved. Due to the successful application of the magnetotelluric method—a new geophysical exploration method—electrical logging of geological drilling has become an indispensable method in geological exploration in Hungary. A fully automatic recording device for electric deep drilling and a lightweight equipment for electric shallow drilling exhibited in our country this time are outstanding contributions made by the Hungarian people in the research of geophysics.

　　In recent years, the Hungarian People's Republic has not only made great progress in geophysical prospecting, but also made remarkable progress in drilling technology and equipment. This exhibition showcases several of the latest drilling machinery, oil extraction machines, and their models. In addition, the Hungarian People's Republic has accumulated rich experience in how to improve the production efficiency of drilling work, which is worth learning from.

　　More than ten academic reports on geophysical prospecting and geological drilling, etc., to be held during the exhibition will be given by several well-known Hungarian experts. They will systematically introduce their rich experience and knowledge, and will provide detailed answers to the questions raised by the audience.

　　Although our country's geological exploration work has made considerable progress in recent years, the working level still needs to be improved urgently. At present, our experience is still very little, but there are many problems in the work. In particular, the foundation of geophysical prospecting work in our country is even weaker, and the country's need for this work is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, our geological workers and geophysical workers must seize this good opportunity of the exhibition and earnestly learn from the advanced science and technology of the Hungarian People's Republic.

　　祝匈牙利探矿设备展览会开幕
　　中华人民共和国地质部副部长　许杰
    匈牙利人民共和国探矿设备展览会十八日在北京开幕了。这是关于地质勘探技术的一种专业性的展览会，它将展出匈牙利人民共和国在石油和其他矿产勘探中所使用的地球物理勘探仪器、钻探机械以及采油工业方面和土木工程方面的一些先进的技术设备。通过这次展览，我们可以更具体地认识到匈牙利人民共和国在有关矿产勘探方面特别是在有关地球物理探矿方面的科学技术上的辉煌成就，从而进一步加强我国科学工作者学习这些先进科学技术的努力。匈牙利人民共和国这次派遣了以匈牙利人民共和国地质总指导委员会主席贝西同志为首的专家代表团来到我国，将在展览期间向我们作出一系列的有关地质勘探的专题报告，并且将在展览会结束后赴野外实地表演各种设备的用途和操作方法。他们这样热诚地、毫无保留地将科学技术的新成就介绍给我国人民，充分地说明了中匈两国之间兄弟般的深厚的友谊。目前我国正在大力开展矿产勘探工作以适应国家建设的需要，这一展览会的举行在提高我国地质勘探的科学技术水平上是会起重大作用的。我们谨以兄弟般的友情对展览会的举行和匈牙利专家的热情工作表示热烈的欢迎和由衷的感谢！
    匈牙利在地球物理探矿工作方面是一个具有悠久历史的国家。匈牙利的伟大科学家埃特渥斯，在前一世纪便已成功地研究和创造了一种重力法勘探的仪器——埃特渥斯扭秤。利用了这种仪器，在欧洲和美洲许多地区曾找出了不少储有大量石油的隐伏在地下的地质构造。这一精密仪器直到目前还是地球物理勘探的重要工具。匈牙利人民共和国成立以后，随着社会主义工业建设的飞速发展，他们在地球物理勘探方面，无论是在科学研究上或实际勘探上都获得了很大的成就；尤其对地震勘探法的研究和改进，使匈牙利制造的地震勘探仪器集中了其他各国同类仪器的优点而又克服了它们的缺点。在不能顺利进行地震勘探的地区，对地震勘探的工作方法作了很多的改进，因而也取得了满意的效果。由于成功地应用了大地电流法——一种新的地球物理勘探方法，地质钻井的电测井工作在匈牙利已成为地质勘探工作中不可缺少的方法。这次在我国展出的一种电测深钻井的全自动记录装置和电测浅钻井的轻便型设备，都是匈牙利人民在研究地球物理这一门科学上所作出的出色的贡献。
    几年来，匈牙利人民共和国不但在地球物理探矿工作上有着巨大的发展，他们在钻探技术和设备方面的进步也是很突出的。这次展览会展出几种最新的钻探机械、采油机器和它们的模型。另外，关于如何提高钻探工作的生产效率的问题，匈牙利人民共和国在这方面积累了丰富的经验，更是值得我们学习的。
    展览会期间准备举行的十多次有关地球物理探矿和地质钻探等等方面的学术报告，是由几位知名的匈牙利专家来担任的。他们将把丰富的经验和学识作系统的介绍，并且将对听众所提出的问题作详细的解答。
    我国地质勘探工作几年来虽然有了相当大的发展，但是工作水平还急待提高。目前我们的经验还是很少，工作中存在的问题却很多。特别是地球物理探矿工作在我国的基础更为薄弱，而国家对这方面工作的需要则日益迫切。因此，我国地质工作者和地球物理工作者都必须抓紧这次展览会的良好机会，认真地向匈牙利人民共和国的先进科学技术学习。
