Comrade Mao Zedong's Report on the Question of Agricultural Cooperation is a Model of Combining Theory and Practice
　　Chen Yi
    Comrade Mao Zedong's report on the question of agricultural cooperation resolved the three-year-long debate within the Party on agricultural cooperation, overcame right-leaning wavering ideas, and enabled some comrades to turn from the wrong path to the correct path of Marxism-Leninism.

    At this new era of the socialist revolution being undertaken by 600 million Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis has provided us with the sharpest spiritual weapon to lead the movement, enabling us to distinguish between right and wrong and see the direction clearly. This has not only profound guiding significance for the agricultural cooperation movement, but also profound guiding significance for the entire socialist cause of our country.

    We can understand and draw lessons from the significance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis from various angles. I believe that the most significant contribution is the theoretical contribution. After the completion of land reform on a national scale, the Party Central Committee clearly put forward the general line of building socialism to the whole Party, put forward various policies for the socialist transformation of gradually implementing the general line in rural areas, and continuously carried out important propaganda explanations and organizational deployments for the implementation of the general line. Under such circumstances, some comrades made a big swing on the issue of the rural cooperative movement. Instead of developing agricultural cooperatives, they contracted and disbanded a large number of cooperatives; instead of leading the masses to take the socialist road, they pulled the masses back from the socialist road; instead of leading the peasants to get rid of the influence of capitalism, they encouraged the peasants to take the capitalist road. One of the experiences of struggle in the years since the founding of the country is that when the Party and the state take any new revolutionary step related to socialism, that is, a revolutionary step aimed at gradually weakening and eliminating the capitalist exploitation system, some people outside the Party will definitely clamor for a while, and at the same time, there will be some echoes within the Party, with much discussion, the practical significance of which is to demand that our Party abandon and weaken the policies of socialist construction and socialist transformation in order to accommodate and obey the bourgeoisie's policy of developing capitalism. Then the question arises: Should we retreat? Should we move forward? Or should we sit down and rest, stop and not move forward? Whenever this situation occurs, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong must come out to represent the will of the millions of masses to move forward, bring out a large number of real materials from the masses, and, based on the theory of Marxism-Leninism, refute various rumors and overcome various wavering ideas, and unite the whole Party and the broad masses to continue to advance, holding high the banner of socialism.

    The power of Marxism-Leninism lies in grasping the laws of historical development, relying on the revolutionary will of millions of masses, conducting scientific analysis of actual life, presenting real evidence, explaining history, guiding the present, and predicting the future. Marxists-Leninists not only need to see what has already appeared on the horizon, but also need to be able to see what will appear in large quantities when there are slight signs on the horizon, and at any time give play to the initiative and creativity of the masses, and provide action plans to promote historical progress. This is of course something that general crawling opportunists can never dream of. The theory of Marxism-Leninism can not only foresee the revolutionary upsurge, but also guide the masses to prepare for and promote the revolutionary upsurge according to objective conditions, so that the revolution can achieve complete victory. Comrade Mao Zedong has played a role in all aspects of the great Chinese revolution, the most important of which is to play the role of a great theorist. Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis on the question of rural cooperation is another vivid example of guiding revolutionary practice with Marxist-Leninist theory and enriching Marxist-Leninist theory from revolutionary practice.

    Why did some of our comrades make mistakes again this time? Why do we have inappropriate complaints? Why do we have endless worries? Why do we accept other people's restrictive rules and make even more new restrictive rules ourselves? Why is it that this rural cooperative movement has already appeared in a high tide or partially in a high tide in the areas where we ourselves are working, but we can't see it, or we are afraid of it when we see it, and immediately stop it? Why is it that Comrade Mao Zedong lives in Beijing, has not been to my place, and has not visited all the villages and towns across the country, but can correctly and timely estimate the ups and downs of the high tide? Why does his thesis speak to the whole country based on the national situation, but it seems to be speaking to my area and my township based on the actual situation of my area and my township? People who have not been to my township or my village can know the enthusiasm of the local masses for doing socialism, but I have lived there for many years and months and I don't know it. What is the reason for this? Does Comrade Mao Zedong really have clairvoyance and clairaudience? Of course not. I think the problem lies in Comrade Mao Zedong's ability to use the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism to solve the actual problems of the Chinese revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong is willing to work hard to investigate and study the actual life of the masses, is good at using direct methods to understand the situation of mass movements, is also good at using indirect methods to understand the situation of mass movements, and is even better at combining the historical knowledge and struggle experience of the Chinese revolution with the current struggle, and is good at using the methods of dialectical logic to discover the essence of things through the phenomena of things. This is fundamentally different from those of us who meet the masses every day but are not familiar with the masses: Comrade Mao Zedong can grasp the pulse of the broad masses, share the fate and breathe with the broad masses, while we often deviate from the masses in our work; Comrade Mao Zedong can rely on new mass movements to concretize the principles of Marxism-Leninism, while we only confine ourselves to the small world of narrow experience and cannot see the new world in the mass movements.

    The reason why many of our comrades make mistakes is that they are unwilling to seriously study Marxist-Leninist theory, unwilling to seriously conduct investigations and research, and unwilling to think deeply. Many comrades are only interested in general surface phenomena, and have no interest in theory at all. When they talk about studying theory, they either fall asleep, or cannot find the door, or return after reaching the door, and end up being an intellectual and theoretical lazy person or an outsider. When many comrades talk about investigating and researching the actual life of the masses, they dislike it for being tedious, dislike it for being boring, are unwilling to do it themselves, and are even more unwilling to study it patiently, neither approaching the masses nor asking the masses for advice. Some comrades also conduct "investigations and research", but they carry their own subjective prejudices, and do not conduct objective research on the mass movement, learn from the masses, and use the experience and wisdom of the masses to supplement themselves, but impose their own wrong subjective prejudices on the masses, wanting to use the name of the masses to strengthen their momentum and facilitate adhering to their own mistakes. This is of course even more undesirable. This is actually bourgeois investigation and research, not Marxist-Leninist investigation and research. From this, it can be seen that not only is investigation and research important, but how to conduct investigation and research is even more important. Comrade Mao Zedong has been diligent in the study of theory and practical investigation and research for decades, and strives to do it whenever he has the opportunity, or strives to create opportunities to do it, does it seriously, and does it honestly, so he can often use sufficient reasons and rich practical experience to pull us back from the wrong path.

    The reason why some of our comrades made mistakes this time is also that they have deviated from the position of the working class. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "They always stand on the position of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants who have a spontaneous tendency towards capitalism, and make plans for the smaller number of people, instead of standing on the position of the working class and making plans for the entire country and all the people." This is a completely correct judgment. Why would some old Communist Party members with one or twenty years of revolutionary history forget the majority and make plans for the smaller number of people? I think it is because they believe that the Chinese bourgeois democratic revolution has been victorious, and the feudal land system has been resolved, so they are very satisfied, and they unconsciously become the agents of the rich peasant class. Why would they turn from the working class position of a Communist Party member to the rich peasant position? Of course, it is unconscious. In the final analysis, it lies in being satisfied with the victory of the bourgeois democratic revolution and forgetting the historical task of the working class. The democratic revolution is only the first step of the Chinese revolution, and there is a second step to take, and it must be taken. For decades, the Party Central Committee's successive instructions and Comrade Mao Zedong's works have clearly mentioned that the next step after the New Democratic Revolution is to engage in socialism, and the next step after the completion of land reform in rural areas is to engage in the agricultural cooperative movement. Why have some comrades forgotten this historical task again? This is of course not only because they have not studied the basic theory of Marxism-Leninism enough, but also because they have discarded the historical knowledge and valuable struggle experience of the Communist Party of China. These comrades are satisfied with the victory of the New Democratic Revolution, and therefore only see a part of the wealthy peasants and forget that the vast number of peasants are still in poverty and need to move towards a higher stage, the stage of socialist revolution.

    There is a passage in Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" that is most worthy of attention:

    "Because the current rise of the peasant movement is an extremely important issue... All revolutionary parties and revolutionary comrades will be tested and decided by them as to whether they should be adopted or abandoned. Should they stand in front of them and lead them? Or should they stand behind them and criticize them with gestures? Or should they stand opposite them and oppose them?"

    This report is a true description of the trend of the Chinese revolution in the spring of 1927, represented by the rural situation in Hunan. This report shows that when the Northern Expeditionary Army advanced to the Yangtze River basin, the vast number of peasants demanded that the revolution be raised to a new stage of land revolution. They were not satisfied with the victory at that time and demanded to continue to move forward. Regarding this issue, the Party and all parties at that time showed three attitudes. The three attitudes pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong are a penetrating summary of the ideological trends of the people at that time. At that time, the Party Central Committee, which was dominated by Chen Duxiu's opportunism, did not adopt the first attitude, actively leading the peasants to realize their demands, but instead adopted the wrong attitude of making comments and criticisms, thus enabling the third attitude of the counter-revolutionary factions such as Wang Jingwei to subdue the peasants and win the counter-revolutionary victory, causing the first great revolution in China to fail. This was the situation twenty-eight years ago. But the attitude of making comments and criticisms pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong at that time can still be found in our Party today in the agricultural cooperative movement. What is the reason for this? This of course reflects an attitude that exists in society in the new class struggle. In addition to this, it is also because those of us who are not good at learning from our own history are too forgetful. We should have a clearer understanding of the road we have taken. Why are we lost again? One of the reasons is that we do not often study the struggle experience of our Party, forget the historical lessons, and therefore make mistakes.

    Comrade Mao Zedong often rescues us from mistakes because he attaches importance to theory and investigation and research, and also attaches importance to the historical struggle experience of our Party. Comrade Mao Zedong does not speak groundless words, but speaks with a solid foundation and reality, constantly drawing lessons from several major revolutions in China, drawing lessons from the current actual movement, and placing the Party's leadership on a reliable scientific foundation with theory and experience. This is also the most worthy place for us to learn.

    Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis uses creative Marxist-Leninist analysis methods to make a new regulation on the strategy problem of the middle peasants. According to Lenin's basic principle of relying on the poor peasants and consolidating the alliance with the middle peasants, Comrade Mao Zedong analyzed the new situation in rural China after the land reform, especially analyzed the new situation that the middle peasants reached 60% to 70% of the rural population, and according to the position, living conditions and attitude towards the socialist transformation of agriculture of the middle peasants in production, decided to list the lower middle peasants among the old middle peasants and the lower middle peasants among the new middle peasants together with the poor peasants as the reliance force. This made the working class find a reliance force of about 60% of the rural population in doing socialist revolution in the rural areas, so that we got a correct answer to the difficult problem of how to do rural class analysis and rely on whom and unite whom.

    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, in the rural cooperative movement, we must pay attention to the following: (1) Take the poor peasants and many new middle peasants with lower economic status and higher political consciousness, the lower middle peasants, and the lower middle peasants among the old middle peasants as the reliance for carrying out the socialist cause in the countryside. The leadership work of the cooperatives should be mainly undertaken by them. (2) Mobilize the poor peasants to do the work of uniting the middle peasants. (3) For the middle peasants and wealthy middle peasants who are not willing to join the cooperative, we should wait patiently and not force them to join the cooperative or take advantage of them. (4) We should have enough understanding of the serious capitalist tendencies of the wealthy middle peasants, and we should conduct criticism and education and unity work on them. Comrade Mao Zedong believes that we should analyze and understand that there are still class differences among the peasant class. This difference is not based on the relationship between exploitation and being exploited, but based on the difference in economic status. Dividing the middle peasants into upper middle peasants and lower middle peasants is not to have another class component division, but to facilitate taking different steps and conducting different persuasion and education work for middle peasants in different situations appropriately. The middle peasant issue belongs to the internal issue of the peasants and should be properly handled as an internal issue. If it is treated as an external issue, it will inevitably make the mistake of infringing on the interests of the middle peasants. This is the outline of Comrade Mao Zedong's policy and working method for the middle peasants proposed to the Party.

    Lenin quoted Goethe's saying: "Theory is gray, but the tree of life is ever green." Some of our comrades did not conduct theoretical analysis of the problem of uniting the middle peasants based on the new actual life, but looked at this problem abstractly, and as a result, both the two deviations of simply accommodating the middle peasants or rudely excluding the middle peasants occurred at the same time. Comrade Mao Zedong, based on the principle that theory guides actual life and also serves actual life, "shoots the arrow of Marxism-Leninism at the target of the Chinese revolution, and makes theory as green as the tree of life." He clearly saw that today, only by implementing agricultural cooperation can we meet the demands of the vast number of peasants and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. The poor peasants and the new and old lower middle peasants demand to engage in cooperatives. This is the main problem, this is the main stream, this is the essence. The Party should lead the vast number of masses forward. Only by relying on them can we do a good job in the socialist transformation of the countryside. The slogan is still to rely on the poor peasants and consolidate the alliance with the middle peasants, but the specific deployment should make appropriate new regulations on the policy towards the middle peasants, that is, to divide the two parts of the lower middle peasants into the reliance force according to their economic status. Only in this way can we determine the socialist superiority in the countryside and achieve the goal of uniting the middle peasants and uniting the middle peasants. Only in this way can socialism be done well and conform to the overall interests of the socialist revolution of the working class.

    Do not regard Marxism-Leninism as dogma, but as a guide to action. Comrade Mao Zedong's resolution of the rural strategic slogan problem of relying on the poor peasants and uniting the middle peasants this time is a new work carried out based on this principle, which is of great significance to the socialist cause of our Party.

    China's socialist revolutionary cause is a more arduous revolutionary cause than the first stage of the bourgeois democratic revolutionary cause. We should have ideological preparations in all aspects to participate in this cause. The socialist revolutionary cause has just begun, and many difficulties may still be ahead. We should have full mental preparation for this fact, so that we will not be shaken down when we encounter a turning point.

　　毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的报告是理论和实践相结合的典范
　　陈毅
    毛泽东同志关于农业合作化问题的报告解决了三年来党内关于农业合作化问题的争论，克服了右倾动摇思想，使一些同志从错误的道路上转到马克思列宁主义的正轨上来。
    正当着中国六亿人民进行社会主义革命的新时代，毛泽东同志这篇论文，给了我们以领导运动的最犀利的精神武器，使我们能明辨是非，看清方向。这不仅仅对于农业合作化运动有深刻的指导意义，而且对于我国整个社会主义事业有深刻的指导意义。
    对于毛泽东同志这篇论文的意义，我们可以从各种角度去了解，去取得教训。我认为其中具有特别重大意义的贡献，是理论上的贡献。土地改革在全国范围完成之后，党中央向全党明白提出了建设社会主义的总路线，提出了在农村逐步实施总路线的各项社会主义改造政策，并且为总路线的实施连续地作了重要的宣传解释和组织部署。在这种情况下，有些同志在农村合作化运动的问题上却来了一个大的摇摆，他们不是去发展农业合作社，而是去收缩和大批解散合作社；不是领导群众走社会主义道路，而是把群众从社会主义道路上拉回来；不是领导农民去摆脱资本主义的影响，而是鼓励农民走资本主义的道路。开国以后的几年来的斗争经验之一，就是当党和国家采取的任何一个新的有关社会主义的革命步骤，即以逐步削弱和消灭资本主义剥削制度为斗争目标的革命步骤时，党外有些人一定有一度叫嚣，同时党内一定也有一些回声，议论纷纷，其实际意义便是要求我党放弃和削弱关于社会主义建设和社会主义改造的政策，以迁就和服从资产阶级的发展资本主义的政策。于是发生这样的问题：是后退呢？是向前呢？或者坐下来休息一下，停止不前呢？每遇到这个情况，党中央和毛泽东同志就不能不出来代表千百万群众的前进的意志，拿出在群众中的大批真实材料，根据马克思列宁主义的理论，驳斥各种浮语谰言，克服各种动摇，团结全党和广大群众高举社会主义的旗帜继续前进。
    马克思列宁主义的威力，在于掌握历史发展的规律，依靠着千百万群众的革命意志，对实际生活进行科学分析，拿出真凭实据，说明历史，指导现在，预见将来。马克思列宁主义者不仅需要看到那在地平线上已出现的东西，而且需要当地平线上略有征候便能看见将要大量出现的东西，随时发挥群众的积极性和创造性，提供推动历史前进的行动计划。这当然是一般爬行主义者所绝不能梦见的事。马克思列宁主义的理论，不仅能预见革命高潮，而且能根据客观条件领导群众去预备和推进革命高潮，使革命达到圆满的胜利。毛泽东同志在伟大的中国革命中起了各方面的作用，其中最主要的作用是起了伟大的理论家的作用。毛泽东同志的关于农村合作化问题的论文，是再一次以马克思列宁主义理论指导革命实践，又从革命实践丰富马克思列宁主义理论的活生生的典范。
    为什么我们有些同志这次又犯错误呢？为什么我们有不适当的埋怨呢？为什么我们有无穷的忧虑呢？为什么我们接受人家的清规戒律而自己又更多地定出新的清规戒律呢？为什么这次农村合作化运动在我们自己工作着的地区已经出现高潮或局部地出现高潮，而自己却看不见，或者看见了却害怕它，而立即加以阻止呢？为什么毛泽东同志住在北京，并没有到我那个地方，并没有到全国各村各乡去拜访过，却能正确地及时地估计高潮的起伏呢？为什么他的论文本是根据全国情况向全国说话，却好像是根据我区我乡的实情在向我区我乡说话呢？当地群众要求干社会主义的积极性，没到过我乡我村的人能知道，而我长年长月住在那里反而不知道，这是什么原因呢？难道毛泽东同志真有千里眼顺风耳吗？当然不是。我想问题在于毛泽东同志善于运用马克思列宁主义的基本原理来解决中国革命的实际问题。毛泽东同志肯用心作群众实际生活的调查研究，善于用直接的方法去了解群众运动的情况，也善于运用间接的方法去了解群众运动的情况，更善于用中国革命的历史知识和斗争经验同当前斗争结合，善于运用辩证逻辑的方法透过事物的现象去发现事物的本质。这就同我们天天和群众见面而并不熟悉群众的人们有了下列的基本差别：毛泽东同志能摸清广大群众的脉搏，同广大群众共命运同呼吸，而我们却常常在工作上脱离群众；毛泽东同志能够依靠新的群众运动使马克思列宁主义原理具体化，而我们只自囿于狭隘经验的小天地，看不见群众运动中的新世界。
    我们很多同志犯错误的原因，在于不肯认真学习马克思列宁主义理论，不肯认真作调查研究，不肯深思苦索。很多同志只对一般表面现象有兴趣，根本对理论无兴趣，谈到学习理论即昏昏欲睡，或不得其门而入，或及门而返，终其身是一个思想上理论上的懒汉或门外汉。很多同志一谈到群众实际生活的调查研究，便嫌其繁琐，便嫌其枯燥无味，既不愿意动手去做，更不愿耐心钻研，既不同群众接近，又不向群众请教。有些同志也作“调查研究”，却是带着自己的主观成见，不是对群众运动作客观研究，向群众学习，以群众的经验和智慧来补充自己，而是以自己的错误的主观的成见强加到群众头上，想借群众的名号来壮大声势，便于坚持自己的错误，这当然更要不得，这实际是资产阶级的调查研究，而不是马克思列宁主义的调查研究。由此可见，不仅调查研究重要，怎样去调查研究更为重要。毛泽东同志对理论的钻研和实际的调查研究，数十年如一日，一有机会便努力去做，或争取机会努力去做，认真地做，老老实实地做，所以能经常以充足的理由和丰富的实际经验把我们从错误的路上拉回来。
    这次我们有一些同志犯错误，还在于脱离了工人阶级的立场。毛泽东同志说：“他们老是站在资产阶级、富农或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意，而没有站在工人阶级的立场上替整个国家和全体人民打主意。”这是完全正确的论断。为什么有些一、二十年革命历史的老共产党员会忘记多数人而替较少人打主意呢？我想就在于他们认为中国资产阶级民主主义革命胜利了，封建的土地制度问题解决了，于是十分满足，就不期然而然地充当了富农阶级的代理人。为什么会从共产党员的工人阶级立场转到富农立场呢？当然是不自觉的，追根究底，在于满足于资产阶级民主主义革命的胜利，忘记了工人阶级的历史任务。民主革命只是中国革命的第一步，还有第二步要走，而且非走不可。数十年来，党中央的历次指示和毛泽东同志的著作都明白提到新民主主义革命以后的下一步是搞社会主义，农村完成土地改革以后的下一步是搞农业合作化运动。为什么有些同志又忘记了这个历史任务呢？这当然不仅是因为马克思列宁主义基本理论学习不够，而且还因为把中国共产党的历史知识和宝贵斗争经验丢在一边。这些同志满足于新民主主义革命的胜利，因而只看见一部分富裕农民而忘记了广大农民尚处在贫困地位，需要向更高的阶段即社会主义革命阶段迈进。
    毛泽东同志的“湖南农民运动考察报告”中有一段话最值得注意：
    “因为目前农民运动的兴起是一个极大的问题……一切革命的党派、革命的同志，都将在他们面前受他们的检验而决定弃取。站在他们的前头领导他们呢？还是站在他们的后头指手画脚地批评他们呢？还是站在他们的对面反对他们呢？”
    这篇报告是一九二七年春间以湖南农村情况为代表的中国革命动向的真实叙述。这篇报告说明了广大农民在北伐军进展至长江流域的时候，要求把革命提高到土地革命的新阶段，他们对当时的胜利并不满足，要求继续前进。对于这一问题，在当时党内党外各方面表现出三种态度。毛泽东同志指出的三种态度是对当时人们的思想动向的一个警辟的概括。当时在陈独秀机会主义支配下的党中央没有采取第一种态度，积极领导农民实现其要求，反而采取第二种评头品足的错误态度，因而使汪精卫等反革命派的第三种态度得以压服农民而获得反革命的胜利，使中国第一次大革命遭到了失败。这是二十八年以前的情况。但毛泽东同志当时所指出的评头品足的态度，在今天农业合作化的运动中依然在我们党内可以找得到，这是什么原因呢？这当然是反映了在新的阶级斗争中社会上存在的一种态度。除此以外，还由于我们这些不善于学习自己的历史的人们太健忘了。本来自己走过的路应该清楚些，为什么又迷路了呢？其原因之一就是不经常研究我党的斗争经验，忘记了历史教训，所以也就犯了错误。
    毛泽东同志时常把我们从错误中挽救出来，是在于他重视理论和调查研究，同时也重视我们党在历史上的斗争经验。毛泽东同志不讲无根据的话，而讲有底有实的话，经常从中国几次大革命中吸取教训，从现在实际运动中吸取教训，而把党的领导放在有理论有经验的可靠的科学基础之上。这也是最值得我们学习的地方。
    毛泽东同志的这篇论文，运用创造性的马克思列宁主义的分析方法，对中农的策略问题作了一个新的规定。毛泽东同志根据列宁的依靠贫农、巩固联合中农的基本原则，分析了中国农村在土地改革后的新局势，特别分析了中农达到占农村人口百分之六十到七十的新情况，根据中农在生产中的地位、生活状况和他们对农业的社会主义改造的态度，决定把老中农中间的下中农和新中农中间的下中农和贫农一起列为依靠力量，这就使工人阶级在农村中干社会主义革命找到了占农村人口百分之六十左右的依靠力量，使我们对怎样作农村阶级分析和依靠谁、联合谁的难题得到了正确的解答。
    按毛泽东同志的指示，在农村合作化运动中，必须注意以下各项：（一）把贫农和许多经济地位较低、政治觉悟较高的新中农中间的下中农、老中农中间的下中农这三者作为进行农村的社会主义事业的依靠。合作社的领导工作主要的应该由他们担任。（二）动员贫农去做团结中农的工作。（三）对于还不愿意加入合作社的中农和富裕中农，应该耐心等待，不勉强入社和揩他们的油。（四）对富裕中农的严重的资本主义倾向，应有足够认识，对他们应进行批评教育和团结工作。毛泽东同志认为应该分析和了解农民阶级中还有阶层上的区别。这个区别不是基于剥削和被剥削的关系，而是基于经济地位的不同。把中农分成上中农和下中农两部分，并不是要再来一次阶级成份的划分，而是为了便于对不同情况的中农适如其份地采取不同的步骤，进行不同的说服教育工作。中农问题是属于农民内部的问题，应该当作内部问题做妥善的处理，如果当作外部问题去处理，必然要犯侵犯中农利益的错误。这就是毛泽东同志向党提出的对中农的政策和工作方法的概要。
    列宁引用过哥德所说的这句话：“理论是灰色的，而生活之树却是常青的。”我们有些同志在联合中农问题上不是根据新的实际生活去作理论的分析，而是抽象地看待这个问题，结果就同时发生了或者简单地迁就中农或者粗暴地排斥中农这两种偏向。毛泽东同志根据理论指导实际生活又为实际生活服务的原则，“以马克思列宁主义之矢射中国革命之的，就使理论像生活之树一样地常青了。他看清楚了今天只有实行农业合作化，才能满足广大农民的要求，才能巩固工农联盟。贫农和新老下中农要求搞合作社，这是主要的问题，这是主流，这是本质。党应该领导广大群众前进。只有依靠他们才能搞好农村的社会主义改造。口号仍然是依靠贫农、巩固地联合中农，但具体部署则应该对中农的政策作适当的新规定，就是把两部分下中农按其在经济上的地位划到依靠的力量方面去。只有这样才能确定农村中社会主义的优势，达到联合中农、团结中农的目的。也只有这样社会主义才办得通，才符合工人阶级的社会主义革命的总利益。
    不要把马克思列宁主义看成教条，而要当成行动指南。毛泽东同志这次解决依靠贫农和联合中农的农村战略口号问题，便是根据这一原则进行了新的工作，对于我党的社会主义事业是极有意义的。
    中国的社会主义革命事业较之第一阶段的资产阶级民主主义革命事业是更其艰巨的革命事业。我们参加这项事业在思想上应有各方面的准备。社会主义革命事业现在刚刚开始，很多的困难可能还在后头。我们对于这一事实应该有充分的精神上的准备，才不致一遇转折就颠簸下来。
