Xinhua News Agency, Tangshan, November 20th. The Ministry of Coal Industry summarized the achievements in mine geological work over the past year at the Second National Coal Mine Geological Work Conference held in Tangshan from November 10th to 14th.

　　Currently, geological work organizations have been generally established in major coal mines across the country. Most coal mines have collected, sorted, reviewed, and corrected existing geological data, and compiled many new geological maps and geological reports for producing mines. Some coal mines have discovered many recoverable coal seams that were abandoned before liberation. The reserves of abandoned recoverable coal seams discovered in Tangjiazhuang Mine of Kailuan Coal Mine alone amount to 16.9 million tons. Some mines in areas that were previously considered to have no potential for development have now found a direction for development. Mine geological workers have also conducted supplementary exploration of existing mines. After these exploration tasks are completed, in addition to ensuring timely supply of geological data for production, the estimated newly added and upgraded coal reserves for producing mines nationwide will be approximately 225 million tons, and the lifespan of 21 mines will be extended by five to ten years.

　　In terms of cooperation with production, 23 coal mines nationwide, including Kailuan and Huainan, have compiled geological descriptions for longwall faces, and 18 coal mines have begun to provide geological descriptions for tunneling faces. In most working faces with geological descriptions, the phenomenon of geological work not keeping up with and affecting production has been reduced. In terms of hydrogeological work, most mines have established underground observation stations and conducted surveys and statistics on mine water inflow. In order to strengthen the technical force of mine geology, more than 550 people have received short-term training in geological technology.

　　The conference decided to strengthen geological work in mines with development prospects, and especially to strive to basically explore the geological conditions of mines producing coking coal in the short term. It is necessary to vigorously promote new operating methods and advanced Soviet experience in exploration projects, and implement the geological description system for longwall and tunneling faces. By establishing "liaison books" with production departments and participating in production meetings, we should promptly grasp underground conditions and help solve geological problems in production. The conference also required all mines to universally strengthen hydrogeological work and carry out the training of geological work cadres according to work needs.

　　煤炭工业部总结一年来矿井地质工作成就
    新华社唐山二十日电　煤炭工业部在十一月十日到十四日在唐山召开的全国煤矿第二届矿井地质工作会议上总结了一年来矿井地质工作的成就。
    目前，全国各大煤矿已普遍地建立起地质工作组织机构。大部分煤矿对现有的地质资料进行了收集、整理和审查、校正工作，编制出许多新的地质图和生产矿井地质报告。有些煤矿发现了不少在解放前被丢弃的可采煤层。只是开滦煤矿唐家庄矿发现被丢弃的可采煤层的储量就有一千六百九十万吨。有些过去被认为没有可能发展的地区的矿井，现在也找到了发展的方向。煤矿地质工作人员还对现有矿井作了补充勘探。这些勘探任务完成后，除保证及时供应生产地质资料外，全国生产矿井预计新增加的及提高等级的储煤量约有二亿二千五百万吨，有二十一个矿井将延长寿命五年到十年以上。
    在配合生产方面，目前全国已有开滦、淮南等二十三个煤矿为回采工作面编制地质说明书，有十八个煤矿已开始为掘进工作面提供地质说明书。绝大部分有地质说明书的工作面，都减少了因地质工作赶不上影响生产的现象。在水文地质工作方面，大多数矿井建立了井下观测站，对矿井涌水进行了调查统计。为了加强矿井地质的技术力量，已经有五百五十多人受到地质技术的短期训练。
    这次会议决定要在有发展前途的矿井中加强地质工作，特别要争取在短期内将生产炼焦煤的矿井地质情况基本上勘探清楚。要在勘探工程中大力推广新的操作法和苏联先进经验，贯彻执行回采、掘进工作面地质说明书制度；通过同生产部门建立“联系簿”和参加生产会议等办法，及时地掌握井下情况和帮助解决生产中的地质问题。会议还要求各矿普遍加强水文地质工作以及根据工作需要进行地质工作干部的培养和训练工作。
