    Soviet Union's Scientific and Technological Assistance to China
    Chen Bing
    As working people all over the world celebrate the great festival of human liberation – the 38th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution – we can see from the implementation of our first Five-Year Plan, which guides us along the socialist path, that our motherland is showing a prosperous, strong and happy scene everywhere. These great achievements are inseparable from the selfless, huge, and fraternal assistance given by our great ally, the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's assistance to our country's socialist construction is reflected in all aspects. The scientific and technological assistance provided by the Soviet Union through scientific and technological cooperation is an important aspect of this.
    Not long after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union began its scientific and technological assistance to our country. In addition to helping our country design 156 industrial enterprises, sending technical experts, and accepting interns, it also provided our country with regular and extensive scientific and technological assistance through scientific and technological cooperation. On October 12, 1954, the governments of China and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Agreement, and the scientific and technological cooperation between China and the Soviet Union developed in a more planned and organized manner. According to this agreement, both parties will regularly and systematically exchange experience in various sectors of the national economy to promote the common high tide of socialist economies in both countries. According to the agreement, China has obtained more and more technical assistance from the Soviet Union. In 1954 alone, the number of technical data projects provided by the Soviet Union to China increased eightfold compared with 1950. The technical data obtained from the Soviet Union over the years are all necessary for our country's industrial construction. These include industrial construction design data, such as metallurgical, coal mine, concentrator, power station, locomotive manufacturing, vehicle manufacturing, oil plant, glass factory, locomotive and vehicle repair factory and other technical data; it also includes drawings for the manufacture of various machinery and equipment, such as cranes, mining loaders, drilling equipment, rolling mills, electric shovels, water turbines, metal processing lathes, water pumps and other machinery and electrical technology equipment; it also includes process data for the production of high-quality steel, steel, film equipment, vacuum instruments, paints, pigments, enamels and other various industrial products; as well as institutional technical documents, teaching plans, teaching outlines, technical standards, etc. This technical data is technically the most advanced and sophisticated, and it is something that we would not be able to design and lack experience in. Without the assistance of the Soviet Union, we would encounter even greater difficulties in large-scale industrial construction.
    The Soviet Union's scientific and technological assistance to our country is not limited to providing a large amount of technical data, but also receiving a large number of expert delegations from our country in various professions to help them learn from the Soviet Union's production and construction experience, and assigning the best experts to patiently guide them. In addition, through scientific and technological cooperation, the Soviet Union has also supplied our country with many excellent crop seeds and medicine samples.
    It is not an easy task for the Soviet Union to provide China with a large amount of technical data and receive a large number of expert delegations from China. Because the data provided by the Soviet Union is the most advanced and the amount is huge. For example, 30% to 50% of the equipment for the 156 industrial enterprises that the Soviet Union helped design are manufactured by our country, and the drawings and data required for these equipment still need to be provided by the Soviet Union through scientific and technological cooperation; technical data for the factory design and equipment manufacturing of 694 industrial enterprises above the quota also need to be provided by the Soviet Union; the construction of other enterprises and the production of existing industries all require Soviet technical data; in short, the scientific and technological difficulties we encounter in construction all need to be consulted with the Soviet Union. Our requests to the Soviet Union are often numerous and urgent, and the Soviet Union always makes every effort and possibility to meet such requests from our country, often organizing a large amount of manpower to compile complex technical data for us, and selflessly handing over the outstanding labor results of the Soviet working class to the Chinese people for use. This most noble spirit of internationalism is very worthy of our admiration and heartfelt gratitude.
    Soviet technical data has been used and is being used in various departments of our country, such as steel, coal mines, oil wells, power stations, machine manufacturing, railway transportation, agriculture, and culture, and has achieved remarkable results, greatly accelerating the speed of our country's socialist construction. According to Soviet technical data, under the specific guidance of Soviet experts, we have carried out capital construction design for newly built and rebuilt industrial enterprises, trained designers, and improved the level of design. Our country has been able to design steel plants, locomotive repair plants, coking ovens, blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, etc. on its own. Designing based on Soviet industrial design technical data generally improves work efficiency by 20% to 30%, with a maximum of 50%, saving design resources and making up for our lack of design resources. Many engineering and technical personnel have continuously improved their technical level in the process of using and learning Soviet technical data, and some have improved from only being able to do construction design to being able to do technical design and some preliminary design.
    According to Soviet technical data, with the help of Soviet experts, we have designed many new products, manufactured and trial-produced many new products, which have played a great role in the production of China's metallurgical industry and the development of the machine manufacturing industry. For example, we have independently designed a large number of electromechanical products and some machinery and equipment; we have manufactured and trial-produced nodular cast iron rolls and nodular cast iron composite rolls, mining machinery and equipment, various metal machine tools, iron barges, film projectors, chemical products, etc. The technical data provided by the Soviet Union solved the difficulties of lacking drawings and design resources, thus enabling our country to learn to manufacture large-scale precision technical equipment and increase the variety of products.
    According to Soviet technical data, we have solved a number of key production issues, improved the quantity and quality of products, saved manpower and material resources, and reduced product costs. For example, the newly manufactured water pump has an 18% higher mechanical efficiency than the old water pump, the pump body is 88% lighter, the number of parts is reduced by 69%, the labor hour consumption is reduced by 56%, the tool savings are 50%, and therefore the cost of the water pump is reduced by 57.5%.
    The Soviet teaching plans and teaching outlines have helped us to formulate unified teaching plans and unified teaching outlines for various subjects in our country. We have used Soviet teaching experience to train and are training a large number of young cadres for socialist construction, so that our country's specialized education has been rectified and transformed relatively quickly, and is increasingly adapted to the needs of the country for training qualified construction talents.
    The assistance given to our country by the Soviet Union through scientific and technological cooperation is meticulous and considers everything for us. When the Soviet members of the Sino-Soviet Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee saw that some industrial enterprises in our country lacked technical data, they personally took notes of it and prepared to solve it; the Soviet Union has always satisfied all the data we need. Moreover, the Soviet Union always thoughtfully considers us and provides a complete set of perfect technical data. The Soviet Union has quickly solved some of our temporary urgent requests. For example, the manufacturing drawings of pile driving equipment urgently needed for the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge were quickly submitted to us for use to ensure the progress of bridge construction. The Soviet Union regards our difficulties as its own and our cause as its own. This sincere and unparalleled friendship is deeply moving.
    The valuable assistance of the Soviet Union to our country through scientific and technological cooperation has begun to blossom and bear fruit in our country's socialist construction cause, and is promoting our country from a technologically backward state to the track of modern science and technology. We must make full use of this favorable condition, work diligently to study, further study the advanced scientific and technological experience of the Soviet Union, and fully and correctly apply it to our country's construction cause, and strive to build our country into a great socialist country after several five-year plans.

    苏联对我国的科学技术援助
    陈冰
    当全世界劳动人民欢庆人类解放的伟大节日——十月社会主义革命三十八周年的时候，从引导我们沿着社会主义道路前进的第一个五年计划的执行中，我们可以看到，我们的祖国到处都出现一片富强繁荣幸福的景象。这些伟大的成就是和我们伟大的盟邦苏联所给予的无私的、巨大的、兄弟般的援助分不开的，苏联对我国社会主义建设的援助，表现在各个方面，通过科学技术合作，苏联所给予我国的援助，就是其中重要的一个方面。
    中华人民共和国成立不久，苏联即开始了对我国的科学技术援助，除帮助我国设计一百五十六项工业企业和派遣技术专家以及接受实习生之外，还通过科学技术合作对我国进行经常的广泛的科学技术援助。一九五四年十月十二日中苏两国政府签订了中苏科学技术合作协定，中苏两国科学技术合作工作便更加有计划有组织的向前发展。根据这个协定，双方将经常地有计划地交流国民经济各部门的经验，促进两国社会主义经济的共同高涨。根据协定，我国已经获得了苏联越来越多的技术援助，仅一九五四年苏联提供我国的技术资料的项目即比一九五○年增长了八倍。历年来从苏联取得的技术资料，都是我国工业建设所必需的。其中包括工业建设设计资料，如冶金、煤矿、选矿厂、电站、机车制造、车辆制造、石油厂、玻璃厂、机车和车辆修理厂以及其他的技术资料；还包括各种机器设备制造图纸，如起重机、矿山装载机、钻探装置、压延机、电铲、水轮机、金属加工车床、水泵和其他机器和电气技术设备的技术资料；还包括生产优质钢、钢材、电影设备、真空仪表、油漆、颜料、磁漆和其他各种工业产品的工艺资料；以及机关技术文献、教学计划、教学大纲、技术标准等。这些技术资料在技术上是最先进和精湛的，而且是我们所不会设计和缺乏经验的。如果没有苏联的援助，我们在大规模的工业建设中，会遇到更大的困难。
    苏联对我国的科学技术援助，不仅限于提供大量技术资料，并且大量接待我国各种专业考察专家帮助他们学习苏联生产建设的经验，并指派最好的专家耐心的辅导他们。此外通过科学技术合作，苏联还供给了我国许多优良农作物种子及药剂样品等。
    苏联提供我国大量的技术资料和接待我国大批考察专家，不是一件轻松的事情。因为苏联供给的资料是最先进的并且数量是巨大的。如苏联帮助设计的一百五十六项工业企业中百分之三十到五十的设备由我国自制，这些设备所需的图纸资料仍然要由苏联通过科学技术合作提供；限额以上的六百九十四项工业企业中的建厂设计及其设备制造的技术资料也需要苏联提供；其他企业的建设和原有工业的生产，无不需要苏联技术资料；总之我们在建设中所遇到的科学技术上的困难，都需要向苏联去请教。我们对苏联的要求常常是又多又急，苏联对我国这样的要求，总是尽一切努力和可能给予满足，经常组织大量的人力为我们编制复杂的技术资料，把苏联工人阶级卓越的劳动成果，无偿地交给中国人民使用。这种最高尚的国际主义的精神，是非常值得我们敬佩和衷心感谢的。
    在我国钢铁、煤矿、油井、电站、机器制造、铁路交通、农业文化等各个部门，使用了和正在使用的苏联技术资料，已取得了显著的成效，大大加快我国社会主义建设的速度。根据苏联技术资料，在苏联专家具体指导下，我们进行了新建和改建的工业企业的基本建设设计，培养了设计人员，提高了设计水平。我国已能自己设计炼钢厂、机车修理厂、炼焦炉、高炉、平炉等。依据苏联工业设计技术资料进行设计，一般提高工作效率百分之二十至三十，最高达到百分之五十，节省了设计力量，弥补了我们设计力量的不足。许多工程技术人员在使用和学习苏联技术资料中，技术水平日益提高，有的由只会做施工设计，提高到能做技术设计和部分初步设计。
    根据苏联技术资料，在苏联专家的帮助下，我们设计出许多种新产品，制造出和试制成功许多种新产品，对我国冶金工业生产和发展机器制造工业上起了很大作用。如自行设计出大批的机电产品和一些机器设备；制造出和试制成功了球墨铸铁轧辊与球墨铸铁复合轧辊、矿山机械设备、各种金属机床、铁驳、电影放映机、化工产品等等。苏联供给的技术资料，解决了我们无图纸和缺乏设计力量的困难，从而使我国学会制造大型的精密的技术设备并增加了产品种类。
    根据苏联的技术资料，我们解决了若干生产上的关键问题，提高了产品的数量和质量，节省了人力物力，降低了产品成本，如制成的新型水泵，比旧型水泵机械效率提高百分之十八，泵体减轻百分之八十八，零件减少百分之六十九，工时消耗降低百分之五十六，工具节省百分之五十，因而使水泵成本降低百分之五十七点五。
    苏联的教学计划、教学大纲，帮助了我们制定我国各科专业的统一教学计划和统一教学大纲。我们运用苏联教学经验，培养了和培养着大批社会主义建设的青年干部，使我国的专门教育比较迅速地得到整顿和改造，并日益适应国家对培养合格建设人才的需要。
    苏联通过科学技术合作给予我国的援助是无微不至的，处处为我们着想的。当中苏科学技术合作委员会的苏联委员们，看到我国某些工业企业缺乏技术资料时，他们就亲自把它笔记下来，准备给予解决；凡是我们所需要的资料，苏联无不给以满足。苏联而且总是周到的为我们考虑，供应全套的完善技术资料。苏联对我国一些临时的紧急请求，更是迅速给以解决，如长江大桥施工中急需打桩设备制造图纸，就很快提交给我们使用，以保证建桥的进度。苏联把我们的困难当作自己的困难，把我们的事业当作自己的事业，这种真挚的无比的友谊是深深令人感动的。
    苏联通过科学技术合作，对我国的宝贵援助，已开始在我国社会主义建设事业中开花结果，正在把我国从技术落后状况推进到现代化科学技术的轨道。我们必须充分利用这种有利条件，兢兢业业地进行学习，进一步地学习苏联先进的科学技术经验，充分地正确地运用到我国的建设事业中来，努力在几个五年计划之后，把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。
