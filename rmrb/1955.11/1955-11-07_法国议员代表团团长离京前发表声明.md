Xinhua News Agency, 5th. The head of the French parliamentary delegation, Daniel Mayer, issued a written statement at Beijing Airport on the 5th, the full text of which is as follows:
	The delegation of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French National Assembly, consisting of Maurice Faure, Jean-Raymond Fruchiere, René Kuhn, and myself, came to China at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. We stayed in China for two weeks. We visited various enterprises, such as mines, textile factories, heavy industry, light industry, agricultural cooperatives, etc., so we could appreciate the achievements of Chinese workers (and farmers). We had several talks with Chinese government leaders, we met with Premier Zhou Enlai, Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Secretary-General of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Mayor of Beijing, Peng Zhen. We also met with senior officials responsible for implementing economic measures. Therefore, we understand the problems faced by the People's Republic of China in many aspects, especially concerning industrialization, agricultural collectivization, people's culture, and ethnic minorities.
	Regarding the prospects of Sino-French relations, it is understandable that we will first report our observations to the French National Assembly and the French government.
	Today, before we leave Beijing, we would like to sincerely thank the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs for their invitation and the warm hospitality they have shown us. We would also like to thank all the people who have been so kind to us during our stay and have tried their best to help us understand the situation.
	Due to unexpected matters waiting for us to attend to, we have to shorten our visit, which we regret very much.
	Nevertheless, this visit will help promote understanding between our two countries.
				Beijing, November 5, 1955

    法国议员代表团团长离京前发表声明
    新华社五日讯  法国议员代表团团长丹尼埃·麦耶五日上午在北京机场发表书面声明，全文如下：
    由莫里斯·富尔，让—雷蒙·弗吕希埃，雷纳·库恩和我自己组成的法国国民议会外交委员会代表团，应中国人民外交学会的邀请前来中国。我们在中国逗留了两个星期。我们参观了各种企业，如矿山、纺织厂、重工业、轻工业、农业合作社等，因此我们能体会到中国工人（和农民）的成就。我们曾和中国政府领导人进行了多次会谈，我们会晤了周恩来总理，全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长刘少奇先生，全国人民代表大会常务委员会秘书长、北京市市长彭真先生。我们还会晤了负责实施经济措施的高级官员。因此我们了解了中华人民共和国在许多方面所面临的问题，特别是关于工业化，农业合作化，人民文化以及少数民族的问题。
    关于中法关系的前景，人们可以理解，我们将就我们的观感首先向法国国民议会和法国政府提出报告。
    今天在我们离开北京之前，我们要衷心感谢中国人民外交学会对我们的邀请以及它给予我们的热诚款待。我们也要感谢在我们逗留期间这样殷勤招待我们并且竭力帮助我们了解情况的所有的人们。
    由于没有预料到的等着我们照料的事情，我们不得不缩短我们的访问，我们感到非常遗憾。
    尽管这样，我们这次访问将有助于增进我们两国之间的了解。
                一九五五年十一月五日，北京
