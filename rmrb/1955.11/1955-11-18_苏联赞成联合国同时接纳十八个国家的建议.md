Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 16th, TASS dispatch: It is learned from usually well-informed sources that the question of admitting new member states to the United Nations was a topic discussed between Molotov and Dulles, and between Molotov and Macmillan, in the past few days.

It is said that Molotov informed the US Secretary of State and the British Foreign Secretary that the Soviet government supports resolving this long-standing issue at the current session of the United Nations General Assembly. Considering this, the Soviet government fully supports the Canadian proposal for the simultaneous admission of eighteen countries that have already applied to join the United Nations. These eighteen countries are: Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Finland, Ceylon, Mongolian People's Republic, Nepal, Jordan, Libya, Laos, Cambodia, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Japan.

Molotov expressed hope that the United States and Britain would also support the aforementioned Canadian proposal.

Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 16th, TASS dispatch: The US representative to the United Nations, Lodge, wrote to the President of the Security Council on the 15th, requesting that the Security Council hold a meeting in the near future to consider the issue of admitting new member states to the United Nations. A spokesman for the British delegation told reporters that Britain supports the US proposal.

A statement circulated by the British delegation in the United Nations said that it is prepared to agree to the admission of all eighteen countries applying to join the United Nations, even if the likelihood of some of them being admitted is questionable.

　　苏联赞成联合国同时接纳十八个国家的建议
    新华社十七日讯　塔斯社日内瓦十六日讯：从通常消息灵通人士方面获悉，联合国接纳新会员国的问题是莫洛托夫和杜勒斯之间以及莫洛托夫和麦克米伦之间在过去几天中进行讨论的一个问题。
    据说，莫洛托夫曾经通知美国国务卿和英国外交大臣，苏联政府赞成在联合国大会本届会议上解决这个长期悬而未决的问题。苏联政府由于考虑到这一点，完全支持加拿大提出的关于同时接纳十八个已经申请加入联合国的国家加入联合国的建议，这十八个国家是：奥地利、阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、意大利、罗马尼亚、芬兰、锡兰、蒙古人民共和国、尼泊尔、约旦、利比亚、老挝、柬埔寨、葡萄牙、爱尔兰、西班牙和日本。
    莫洛托夫表示希望美国和英国也将支持上述的加拿大建议。
    新华社十七日讯　据塔斯社纽约十六日讯：美国驻联合国代表洛奇十五日写信给安全理事会主席，要求安全理事会在最近的将来举行一次会议来考虑联合国接纳新会员国的问题。英国代表团的一位发言人对记者们说，英国支持美国这个建议。
    英国代表团在联合国中散发的一份声明中说，它准备同意接纳要求参加联合国的十八个国家全部加入联合国，即使它们当中有些国家被接纳的可能性是有疑问的。
