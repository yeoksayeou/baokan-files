Gansu is investigating the Xiaolongshan Forest Area

The key survey work in the Xiaolongshan Forest Area, one of the major forest areas in Gansu Province, has completed its annual planned task of 26,000 hectares. Now, the forest survey teams, with their measuring tools and tents, continue to work hard to exceed the surveyed forest area by 4,000 hectares.

The Xiaolongshan Forest Area is located in the Tianshui Special District and covers an area of ​​360,000 hectares. It is one of the excellent forest areas in Gansu Province. The natural conditions here are very good, and the trees grow quickly. The existing forest has a great economic value. There are birch, red birch, Qinggang oak, Chinese white pine and fir, which are durable and can be used as construction timber, as well as cork oak, ash, Chinese gall and Eucommia, which can be used as special timber. In order to nurture and renew this forest area and carry out rational felling, the Gansu Provincial People's Committee sent a survey team in May this year to conduct a survey. After the survey, a management and operation plan for the development, protection and utilization of the forest will be formulated, and large-scale renewal, nurturing and artificial afforestation will be carried out so that this forest area can supply more materials to the country in the future.

    甘肃调查小陇山林区
    甘肃省主要林区之一——小陇山林区的重点调查工作，已完成全年计划任务二万六千公顷。现在，森林调查队员们带着测量工具和帐篷，继续紧张进行调查，为超额完成四千公顷森林的调查面积而努力。
    小陇山林区位于天水专区，面积有三十六万公顷，是甘肃省优良林区之一。这里自然条件很好，树木成长很快。现有林木经济价值也很大，有坚固耐用可作建设木材的白桦、红桦、青棢、华山松、冷杉，还有可作特种用材的拴皮栎、白腊、五倍子、杜仲等。甘肃省人民委员会为了使这个林区得到抚育更新和进行合理采伐，今年五月派出调查分队进行调查，调查后将作出发展保护和利用森林的经理施业方案，进行大规模的更新抚育和人工造林，让这个林区将来为国家供应更多的材料。
