　　Iron Factory Serves Agricultural Cooperation
　　Yang Tingfu
    The arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperation has brought a prosperous scene to the Yuxian Iron Factory, a local state-owned enterprise in Henan Province. Every day, buyers from agricultural producers' cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives come in droves, driving horse carts, ox carts, or carrying loads on shoulder poles to purchase goods in bulk. According to statistics for September and October, the total sales volume was worth more than 3,255,000 yuan, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to the same period last year. Lü Zhongju, a purchaser from the No. 1 District Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuxian, bought goods from the factory twice in three days and also said: "If we were to buy enough for our cooperative, we would need eight carts." Now even the old stock accumulated in the past two years has almost been sold out. Agricultural producers' cooperatives are most active in purchasing goods. Members of the Yanglou Township Agricultural Producers' Cooperative, fearing that they would not be able to buy the goods, waited in the sales department, and some even paid deposits in advance.
    In order to support the agricultural cooperation movement, the factory overfulfilled its production plan in September and October. Workers in the foundry group broke through the target in 16 of the 19 products produced in October, overfulfilling the production plan by 167 percent. Moreover, while ensuring quality, they saved more than 2,900 jin of raw materials and more than 760 jin of coal. Wang Zhenhe, a foundry technician, devised a method to change the hard mold for casting pots into an iron mold, which not only ensured quality specifications but also increased productivity by 20 percent, enabling the entire group to complete the October plan three days ahead of schedule. Recently, the workers also manufactured sweet potato cutting machines and seedling transplanters, which were welcomed by the farmers. When worker Yan Ruhai heard that the high tide of agricultural cooperation had arrived in Henan Province, he said happily: "In the future, we must improve our technology and produce more new farm tools to meet the needs of farmers." All employees also proposed to complete the annual production plan one month ahead of schedule.

　　为农业合作化服务的铁工厂
　　杨廷孚
    农业合作化高潮的到来，给河南省地方国营禹县铁工厂带来了繁荣景象。每天从农业生产合作社和供销合作社来的买主，赶着马车、牛车或担着挑子来大宗购货。据九、十月份统计总销售量价值三百二十五万五千多元，比去年同期增加将近一倍半。禹县第一区供销合作社采购员吕中聚，三天到工厂买回两次货，还说：若叫我们社买足量，还得八马车。现在连前二年积下的陈货也几乎卖光了。农业生产合作社购货最积极，杨楼乡农业生产合作社的社员，因怕货买不到手里，就坐在门市部等着，也有先交定钱的。
    工厂为了支援农业合作化运动，在九、十月份都超额完成了生产计划。翻砂组的工人，十月份生产的十九种产品中，有十六种突破了指标，以百分之一百六十七超额完成生产计划，并且在保证质量的情况下，节约原料二千九百多斤，煤炭七百六十多斤。翻砂技工王振合想办法把铸锅硬模改成铁模后，不仅能保证质量规格，并且能提高生产率百分之二十，使全组提前三天完成了十月份的计划。最近工人们还制造了切红薯机和移苗器，受到了农民的欢迎。工人阎如海听说河南省农业合作化高潮来到了，高兴地说：今后更得好好提高技术了，多生产些新农具，满足农民的需要。全体职工还提出要提前一个月完成全年的生产计划。
