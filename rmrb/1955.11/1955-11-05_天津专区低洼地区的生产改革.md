Production Reform in Low-lying Areas of Tianjin Prefecture
Zhao Ke, Secretary of the Tianjin District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hebei Province

The counties of Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, have historically been disaster-prone areas. In years with heavy rainfall, river floods and waterlogging occur simultaneously, and even in normal years, there is significant waterlogging.

In the years since liberation, we have devoted considerable effort to dredging rivers and building dikes to prevent river flooding. However, because we only focused on flood prevention and did not closely integrate flood and waterlogging prevention, flood disasters have been reduced, but waterlogging remains severe. In terms of grain alone, it is estimated that 3.8 billion catties were lost due to water damage in the past five years. How to change this situation in low-lying areas has become an important issue for the Tianjin Prefecture Party Committee and government.

Since the autumn of last year, we have begun to carry out production reform in low-lying areas. This is a major undertaking to mobilize the masses to fight against nature and change production methods. For this important work, we have adopted a method of relying on the masses, overcoming difficulties, being proactive and cautious, and progressing gradually. When the work began, the famine was severe, so we led the masses in engaging in sideline occupations while carrying out production reform. We summarized and promoted 23 experiences in changing crops from both inside and outside the region, enabling the masses to have a concrete understanding of natural conditions and establishing confidence in human ability to conquer nature. This year, the region completed 2.1 million mu of crop conversion tasks, which is estimated to increase grain production by 300 to 400 million catties. Through more than a year of practice, Party committees and governments at all levels have also gained experience in leading agricultural production reform in low-lying areas, laying the foundation for further transforming low-lying areas in the future.

Over the past year, we have carried out the following two reform tasks in agricultural production in low-lying areas.

First, effectively utilizing the water resources of low-lying areas.

The rainfall pattern in this area is as follows: during the summer and autumn seasons when crops do not lack rain, floods and torrential rains are concentrated; in the spring when cultivation requires water, the river water is dry, and there is little rainfall. Therefore, in addition to flood and waterlogging prevention, the following three methods are adopted to effectively utilize the water resources of low-lying areas.

First is water storage. In the late autumn and early spring seasons, when the flood season has passed and the river water still maintains a considerable level, water is stored in large quantities in depressions, lakes, and river bends. Water storage can make full use of reliable methods such as sluice gates and opening up new waterways. Water use must be planned. The Wen'an Depression in Wen'an County and the Tuanbo Depression in Jinghai County, for example, store more than 300 million cubic meters of water, using this water to plant more than 300,000 mu of rice and lake rice (a type of rice that can grow in deeper water), and raise reeds on 100,000 mu.

Second is irrigation. Generally, the river water level is raised, and the water is diverted outwards using canal projects. The irrigated land must have irrigation and drainage systems; uncontrolled flooding easily alkalizes the land. Using wind power to build embankments to block water is also a good way to use the accumulated water in the depressions to irrigate the land. Another method is to use channel equipment, water-pulling tools, and small machines to pump water. This is a larger investment, but it can be widely used in areas along the river.

Third is winter irrigation. The black soil in low-lying areas is prone to losing moisture. Watering and freezing can both retain moisture and increase water content. Ninghe County irrigated 38,500 mu of autumn wheat this winter, yielding 160 catties per mu, an increase of nearly half compared to those not irrigated. This is an effective way to combat drought and ensure harvest in riverside areas.

Of the 2.1 million mu of land in Tianjin Prefecture's low-lying areas that implemented production reform this year, the area for water storage and drainage reached 1.7 million mu, the area for desalination of alkaline soil was 250,000 mu, and the area for irrigation was more than 100,000 mu. All of these provided conditions for changing crop types.

Second is to change the planting system in a planned way. This is another major production reform implemented in low-lying areas.

First, in perennially waterlogged depressions and lakes, implement a planting system based on water classification. These areas are basin-shaped depressions formed between rivers or between rivers and highlands. In the past, due to standing water in summer and autumn, the masses mostly waited for the water to dry up before planting. However, as long as the water is managed, different crops can be planted according to the depth of the water, which can completely guarantee the harvest and increase production. The Jianchapu Depression in Ba County has a total of 70,000 mu of land. One-thousand mu of reeds were planted in the deep-water area, 30,000 mu of lake rice were planted in the shallow water area, 20,000 mu of dry rice were planted in the near-water area, and corn and sorghum were planted on the high ground. Now, it seems that rice alone can harvest 15.5 million catties. The Jianchapu Depression has a total population of 18,411, with an average of 820 catties of rice per person. It can be seen that this is a reasonable planting system that makes the best use of land and water.

Second, change to planting early-maturing, water-resistant, and high-yielding crops to stabilize production in flood-prone areas. The crops planted on this type of depression are not guaranteed to produce every year, and the masses hold a negative attitude of "planting depends on people, and harvest depends on heaven," only planting one season of summer-harvest crops such as wheat and potatoes, and the potential of the land is not fully utilized. In response to this situation, we have adopted an intercropping method that can both promote early maturity of crops and ensure high yields, allowing for harvests in both summer and autumn (this has not been fully promoted this year). The content of this intercropping method is: (1) Intercropping wheat and rice, wheat and hemp. The two intercropped crops do not affect each other's growth. After the wheat is harvested, the rainy season begins, and rice and hemp are both water-resistant, especially dry rice, which grows faster after seeing water, and can be harvested in the autumn. (2) Planting high-yielding crops, mainly potatoes. This type of crop is planted early, grows quickly, and has high yields, and can be harvested before the rainy season. Drained land, sandy loam soil, river beach land, and slightly alkaline land can all be planted with potatoes. (3) In places where water conservancy projects have been built and are not flooded by external water, black beans and barnyard grass can be planted. This type of crop is not afraid of small water, not afraid of weeds, and the yield is not low. In addition, judging from this year's dry rice planting, dry rice is afraid of weeds. The Jianchapu Depression in Ba County has implemented intercropping of rice and beans, which has reduced the phenomenon of weed growth.

Transforming the production conditions of low-lying areas and changing the methods of planting crops are derived from investigating and summarizing the production experience already existing among the masses. In the struggle against natural disasters, the farmers of Tianjin Prefecture have created many experiences in increasing production. We have summarized these experiences, which have become important methods for increasing production in low-lying areas.

Our approach to promoting the experience of changing crop types is to demonstrate everywhere and promote it on a large scale in areas with suitable conditions. To solve the technical problems of changing crop types, we organized a technical team of 1,957 people, extensively and systematically established mass technical organizations, trained a large number of key personnel, and emphasized that cadres must first learn the technology of changing crop types. In this way, we created a prerequisite for carrying out the production reform movement throughout the region. In order to solve the problem of seeds, we bought potatoes and collected lake rice seeds from various sources. However, in the process of carrying out this work, we underestimated the complexity of this work and the resistance of conservative ideas among cadres and the masses. Experience has shown that even after education, the masses' awareness and enthusiasm for fighting against nature have improved, it is still necessary to do a lot of work to teach the masses how to plant according to scientific methods. The example of the masses in the depression of Wen'an County using the old method to deal with the new rice seeds of "Jingang" and "Yinfang," failing to sprout the seedlings, and damaging 30,000 ponds, is one example. The overall plan for changing crop types has been exceeded, but there are still many specific problems and shortcomings. Taking the change of planting potatoes as an example, first, because some counties had the idea that it is better to plant less than to plant more, and some counties had suitable soil and climate, they only planted half of the planned area, so that the production plan of 150 million catties in the region was not completed. Second, technical guidance was not done enough. Some places the masses did not know how to plant potatoes; some places the masses planted potatoes but did not know how to manage them, and did not earth up the soil when the seedlings grew half a foot high, resulting in a yield reduction of 800 to 900 catties per mu. After the potatoes were harvested, some farmers did not know how to preserve them, causing some of the potatoes to rot. Although this situation is a minority, it also shows that the comprehensive dissemination of technology has not been done enough. Again, the material preparation required for changing crops was insufficient. The potato seeds were not prepared before the year, and only went to the northeast to buy them after the year; because the weather was cold, they had to be wrapped in fifteen layers of paper like fresh goods, and it was more than ten days late when they were transported to the changed planting areas.

The production reform in low-lying areas vividly proves a truth: when the broad masses of farmers recognize the laws of nature and rise up to fight against nature, their strength is immeasurable. This year, in addition to completing nearly 10 million cubic meters of earthwork projects in the region, the masses themselves also completed 3 million cubic meters of farmland water conservancy projects. Baodi County, which mobilized the most migrant workers, mobilized 600,000 workdays for spring canal construction.

Agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation is an important guarantee for production reform in low-lying areas. The change of crop types in low-lying areas requires a large number of water conservancy projects; the change of planting crops requires a high degree of technology and appropriate tools. These are not things that individual farmers can do on their own. This year, 95% of the 30,000 mu of fields planted in Tuanbo Depression in Jinghai County were completed by cooperatives and mutual aid groups. Some cooperatives purchased a large number of new-style agricultural tools and pumping tools in order to reclaim wasteland and divert water for rice planting; some cooperatives also planned to go to depressions with fewer people and more land in other areas to reclaim wasteland. In the Dazhongzhuang Depression in Baodi County and the Tuanbo Depression in Jinghai County alone, 118 cooperatives from other places have reclaimed more than 10,000 mu of wasteland. The planting of potatoes is also the same. Individual farmers generally only plant one or two mu; all the large-scale changes of planting potatoes are done by cooperatives and mutual aid groups. The results of the cooperatives and mutual aid groups implementing the change of planting crops have greatly increased the income of the cooperatives and groups. The superiority of the cooperatives in production has powerfully attracted farmers outside the cooperatives. Before the change of crop types, there were only 207 cooperatives in the seven large depressions of Wen'an, Tuanbo, and Dazhongzhuang, which have now developed to 532. At the same time, mutual aid groups have also developed greatly. Many mutual aid groups are also actively preparing to transfer to cooperatives. Many individual farmers have registered with the cooperatives, requesting to join the cooperatives after the autumn. Facts have proved that the development of cooperativization has guaranteed the smooth progress of the production reform movement in low-lying areas, and the achievements of this reform have in turn promoted the consolidation and development of mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Therefore, production reform and social reform in low-lying areas must be carried out and done well at the same time.

    天津专区低洼地区的生产改革
    中共河北省天津地委书记　赵克
    河北省天津专区各县历来是多灾地区，雨水大的年头，河水、内涝同时成灾，一般年头也有相当面积的内涝灾害。
    解放后几年来，我们用了相当大的力量挖河修堤，防止河水泛滥。但是由于只重视了防洪，没有把防洪防涝紧密结合，洪水灾害虽然减轻，内涝还是严重。仅粮食一项，总计五年因水害减收的就有三十八亿斤。如何改变低洼地区的这种状况，便成为摆在天津专区的党委和政府面前的一个重要课题。
    从去年秋天起，我们开始进行低洼地区的生产改革工作。这是发动群众向自然界进行斗争和改变生产方法的一件大事。对于这件重要工作，我们采取了依靠群众，克服困难，积极慎重，逐步前进的办法。工作开始的时候，灾荒正严重，因此我们就一面领导群众搞副业，一面搞生产改革。我们总结并推广了全区和外地二十三项改种经验，使群众具体了解了自然条件，奠定了人定胜天的信心。今年全区完成了二百一十万亩的改种任务，估计可以多收粮食三亿到四亿斤。通过近一年多来的实践，使各级党委和政府也取得了领导低洼地区农业生产改革的经验，给今后进一步改造低洼地奠定了基础。
    一年多来我们在低洼地区的农业生产方面进行了以下两项改革工作。
    首先是有效地利用低洼地的水利。
    这个地区雨水的规律是：农作物不缺雨的夏秋两季，洪水暴雨集中为害；春季耕作需要用水，河水却又干枯，雨水也少。因此，除了要防洪防涝外，还采取以下三个方法，有效地利用低洼地区的水。
    第一是蓄水。在秋末和春初季节，汛期已过，而河水还保持相当水位的时候，在洼、淀、河湾大量储水。储水可以充分利用闸涵、开沽等可靠办法。用水必须有计划。文安县的文安洼、静海县的团泊洼等洼地约存三亿多立方公尺的水，利用这些水种植了三十多万亩水稻和淀稻（一种能在较深的水中生长的稻谷），养了十万亩苇子。
    第二是灌溉。一般是把河水水位提高，利用沟渠工程引水外流。浇灌的地要有灌、排系统；无管制地漫溢，容易使土地碱化。利用风力筑埝拦水，也是利用洼地积水浇地的好办法。另外，是利用渠道设备、拉水工具和小型机器扬水。这是投资较大的一种；但在沿河洼边地区，可以普遍采用。
    第三是冬浇。低洼地区的黑土漏风地，水分极易流失，浇水封冻既能保墒，又能增加水分。宁河县今年冬浇秋麦三万八千五百亩，每亩产一百六十斤，比不浇增产近一半。这是沿河地区有效的抗旱保收的办法。
    天津专区低洼地今年实行生产改革的二百一十万亩地中，蓄水排涝面积达一百七十万亩，放甜冲硷二十五万亩，灌溉十多万亩。这些，都给改种农作物提供了条件。
    其次是有计划地改变种植制度。这是在低洼地区实行的另一项重大的生产改革。
    第一、在常年积水的洼淀，实行按水分类的种植制度。这些地区是河和河之间或河和高地之间构成的盆形洼地，过去因夏秋两季多存积水，群众多是等待水干后再种地。但是，只要把水管理起来，根据水的深浅，分别种植不同的作物，完全可以保收增产。霸县煎茶铺洼共有七万亩土地，在深水区栽了一万亩苇子，在浅水区种了三万亩淀稻，在近水区种了二万亩旱稻，在高地上种玉米、高粱。现在看来，仅稻谷一项即可收一千五百五十万斤。煎茶铺洼共有人口一万八千四百一十一人，平均每人可收到稻谷八百二十斤。由此可见，这是一种使地尽其力、水尽其用的合理的种植制度。
    第二、改种早熟、耐水、高产作物，稳定易涝过水区的生产。在这种洼地上种的庄稼每年不保收，群众抱着“种地在人，收成在天”的消极态度，只种一季小麦、马铃薯等夏收作物，土地的潜力得不到充分发挥。针对这种情况，我们采用了既能促进作物早熟还能保证高产、夏秋两季都能收获的间作方法（今年还没有全面推广）。这种间作方法的内容是：（一）实行麦和稻、麦和麻间作。间作的两种作物互不影响生长，小麦收获后，雨季正开始，而稻、麻都能耐水，特别是旱稻，见水之后，生长更快，秋季可以收获。（二）种植高产作物，主要是马铃薯。这类作物种的早，长的快，产量高，雨季前即可收获。退水地、沙壤土、河滩地、微碱地都可种马铃薯。（三）在兴办水利工程后不受外水淹的地方，可种植黑豆、稗子。这类作物不怕小水，不怕草，产量也不低。另外，从今年种旱稻的情况看，旱稻怕草荒，霸县煎茶铺洼实行稻、豆间作的地方，草荒现象就减少。
    改造低洼地的生产条件和改变种植作物的办法是调查总结群众中已有的生产经验而得出的。天津专区的农民在和自然灾害斗争中，已经创造了许多增产的经验。我们总结了这些经验，这些经验便成了低洼地区增产的重要方法。
    我们采取推广改种农作物的经验的做法是：到处示范，在有条件的地区大面积地推广。为解决改种的技术问题，我们组织了一千九百五十七人的技术队伍，广泛地系统地建立了群众性的技术组织，训练了大批骨干，强调干部首先要学会改种技术。这样，就给开展全区范围的生产改革运动创造了前提。为了解决籽种问题，我们买进了马铃薯，并从多处搜集了淀稻稻种等。但在进行这个工作的过程中，我们对于这一工作的复杂性估计不足，对于干部和群众中的保守思想的抵触估计不足。经验证明，即使经过教育后，群众向自然界作斗争的觉悟和积极性提高了，要教会群众按照科学方法进行种植，仍须做很多工作。文安县洼地群众沿用旧法处理“金钢”、“银坊”新稻种，催秧不成，坏池子三万个，就是一例。改种农作物的总的计划是超过了，但是还有不少具体问题和缺点。以改种马铃薯为例，首先，由于有的县有少种比多种好的思想，有的县土壤、气候适合，也只种到计划的一半，以致没有完成全区一亿五千万斤的产量计划。其次，技术指导做得不够。有的地方群众不会种马铃薯；有的地方群众种上马铃薯后又不会管理，秧长半尺高不培土，结果一亩减产达八、九百斤。马铃薯收获后，有的地方农民不会保存，使马铃薯腐烂了一部分。这种情况虽是少数，但也说明在技术的全面传播方面是做得不够的。再次，改种所需要的物资准备不足。马铃薯种年前没有筹备，年后才到东北去买；由于天气寒冷，不得不用十五层纸像包鲜货一样的包裹好，运到改种地区，还晚了十多天。
    低洼地的生产改革生动地证明了一个真理：当广大农民认识了自然界的规律，从而起来向自然界作斗争的时候，其力量是不可估量的。今年全区在完成了近千万公方的土方工程以外，群众自己还完成了三百万公方土方的农田水利工程。动员民工最多的宝坻县春季修渠时出动了六十万个日工。
    农业生产互助合作是低洼地区生产改革的重要保证。低洼地区的改种，需要大量兴修水利工程；改种农作物需要有高度的技术和适当的工具。这些都不是单干农民的力量所能办到的。静海县团泊洼今年种植的三万亩田，百分之九十五是合作社和互助组完成的。有些合作社为了开荒引水种稻而购置了大批新式农具和抽水工具；有些合作社还有计划地到外地区的人少地多的洼去开荒。单是宝坻县大钟庄洼、静海县团泊洼两处，就有外地一百一十八个社垦耕了一万多亩荒地。马铃薯的种植也是这样。单干农民一般只种一两亩；凡是大片改种的马铃薯，都是合作社和互助组的。合作社和互助组实行改种的结果，大大地增加了社、组的收入。合作社在生产上突出地表现出来的优越性，有力地吸引了社外农民。文安、团泊、大钟庄等七个大洼在改种前只有合作社二百零七个，现已发展到五百三十二个。同时互助组也有很大发展。很多互助组也在积极准备转社。不少单干农民到社挂号，要求秋后入社。事实证明，合作化的发展保证了低洼地生产改革运动的顺利进行，而这一改革的成就转过来又促进了互助合作组织的巩固和发展。所以，低洼地区的生产改革和社会改革，必须同时进行，同时做好。
