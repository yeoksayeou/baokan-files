Comrade Vice Chairman, Comrade Premier, Comrades and Friends:

    First of all, for having the opportunity to express my greetings to you, and through you to the friendly Chinese people and Chairman Mao Zedong of the People's Republic of China, as well as to the distinguished representatives and our dear comrades and friends who are with us today, on the most important day in the history of Yugoslavia and its various nationalities, please allow me to express the gratitude of my wife, myself, and my colleagues.

    Although it has not been long since the People's Republic of China and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia officially established diplomatic relations, I am very pleased that the facts have already proven that all conditions exist for the comprehensive development of political, economic, and cultural relations between us. There is no doubt that this is an important new contribution to the cause of world peace and international cooperation on an equal footing.

    The Chinese and Yugoslav peoples, each under the leadership of their respective Communist Parties, waged heroic, selfless, and arduous struggles for liberation and independence, and won this struggle with the support and assistance of freedom-loving humanity. We are confident that the mutual support and assistance in the war of liberation will continue to develop and strengthen in the struggle to build socialism. This will prove to be most beneficial not only to our people but also to the democratic and socialist forces of the world.

    Yugoslavia, as a small country, its people only hope to live peacefully and amicably with the people of other countries. In its eventful history, Yugoslavia has been subjected to unreasonable oppression from all sides more than once. But the Yugoslav people have always been invincible and inviolable, and now, in a situation of national renewal, under the leadership of the glorious League of Communists and Comrade Tito, they are building a new socialist society for themselves.

    The War of Liberation and the People's Revolution brought freedom to our people, but the country was ravaged, became poorer, and the population was greatly reduced. Ten years have passed since then, a decade of new struggles and new achievements, a decade full of new successes and new experiences.

    With the greatest effort and self-sacrifice, the Yugoslav people have broken free from backwardness and dependence on foreign countries, built the necessary basic industries, and laid the foundation for the comprehensive development of the national economy and the gradual and steady improvement of the living standards of the working people. The socialist democratic system has also been continuously developed and strengthened. The socialist democratic system is based on the principle of self-governance by the working people in all aspects of social life, thus giving a thorough blow to bureaucracy, significantly expanding the scope of self-governance of the working people, giving full play to the initiative and consciousness of workers in building socialism, and naturally fully guaranteeing the leading role of the working class. Through these efforts and achievements, the working people of Yugoslavia have enhanced socialist consciousness and patriotic thought.

    Dear Comrades, please allow me to say this: we Yugoslavs, who have made great efforts in the struggle to liberate ourselves from poverty and backwardness and to strengthen the power of the working people, and who still have many great tasks to be completed, fully understand and especially admire and respect the great efforts and sacrifices made by the Chinese people for the progress and prosperity of their beautiful and great country; we are happy for every achievement you make, as if those achievements were our own.

    The respect that Yugoslavia receives in the international community is not due to the size of the country or its military strength, but to the achievements we have made in domestic construction and to our independent foreign policy based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and peaceful coexistence.

    This policy, followed by your government and our government, as well as an increasing number of other countries, is today the only alternative to the policy of dividing the world into blocs, a policy that keeps the world in a constant state of tension and will undoubtedly, sooner or later, subject the whole world to complete destruction and annihilation. This threat has not completely disappeared, but it has been greatly eased by the support of the people of all countries for a policy of peace. This strengthens our confidence that we should spare no effort to continue to implement and further develop such a policy.

    The constructive and progressive principles of peacefully resolving all existing disputes and strengthening mutual assistance and cooperation between the people of all countries have once again been newly proven in the Belgrade Declaration. Yugoslavia's foreign policy has been and continues to be based on this principle. The greater significance of the Belgrade Declaration is that it makes a strong new contribution to the development of mutual relations between socialist countries on an equal footing.

    Dear Comrades, I am confident that the friendly relations of mutual support and mutual assistance between our two countries and peoples will continue to develop and strengthen day by day in a direction beneficial to our people and our common interests.

    In toasting to the health and longevity of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, our beloved Comrade Mao Zedong, please allow me to express my heartfelt congratulations to the Chinese people and to the further development and prosperity of the People's Republic of China.

### 波波维奇大使的讲话

　　波波维奇大使的讲话副主席同志，总理同志，同志们和朋友们：
    首先为了在南斯拉夫和其各族人民历史上最重要的一天，我能够有机会向您，并通过您向友好的中国人民和中华人民共和国主席毛泽东同志，以及向今天和我们在一起的诸位卓越的代表们，我们的亲爱的同志们和朋友们致意，请允许我表示我的夫人、我自己和我的同仁们的谢意。
    自从中华人民共和国和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国正式建立外交关系至今虽然还没有多久，但是我感到非常高兴的是：事实已经证明有一切条件来全面发展彼此间的政治、经济和文化关系。毫无疑问这对于世界和平事业和在平等的基础上进行国际合作是一项重要的新贡献。
    中国人民和南斯拉夫人民，各在其本国的共产党的领导下，进行了英勇的、大公无私的、最艰巨的、争取解放和独立的斗争，并且在爱好自由的人类的支持和援助下获得了这一斗争的胜利。我们确信在解放战争中的互相支持和援助将在建设社会主义的斗争中继续发展和加强。这将表明不仅对于我国人民而且对于全世界民主和社会主义的力量都是最有利的。
    作为一个小国的南斯拉夫，其人民只希望和其他国家人民友好地和平共处。南斯拉夫在其多难的历史上曾不止一次地受到从各方面来的无理的压迫。但是南斯拉夫人民一直是不可战胜的和不可侮辱的，现在他们在举国一新的局面中，在光荣的共产主义者联盟和铁托同志的领导下，正为他们自己建设着社会主义新社会。
    解放战争和人民革命给我国人民带来自由，但是国家却遭到蹂躏，越发贫穷，人口大减。从那时到现在十年过去了，这是经历了新的斗争和获得了新的成就的十年，是充满了新的成功和新的经验的十年。
    南斯拉夫人民以最大的努力和自我牺牲的精神摆脱了落后和对外依赖的状态，建设了必要的基本工业，为国民经济的全面发展和逐渐稳步地提高劳动人民的生活水平打下基础。社会主义民主制度也随之不断地发展和加强。社会主义民主制度是以劳动人民在社会生活各方面进行自治为原则的，因而对于官僚主义给予了彻底的打击，显著地扩大了劳动人民自治的范围，发挥了工人在建设社会主义中的积极性和自觉性，自然也充分保证了工人阶级的领导作用。南斯拉夫的劳动人民通过这些努力和成就提高了社会主义觉悟和爱国思想。
    亲爱的同志们，请允许我这样说：我们南斯拉夫人，曾经以巨大的努力进行过旨在从贫穷落后中解放出来的斗争和加强劳动人民政权的斗争，并且仍有许多巨大的任务尚待完成的我们南斯拉夫人，完全了解并特别钦佩和尊敬中国人民为其美丽而伟大的国家的进步与繁荣所尽的巨大的努力与牺牲；我们为你们每项成就而感到高兴，就像那些成就是我们的一样。
    南斯拉夫在国际中所受的尊重并不是由于国家的大小或其军事力量，而是由于我们在国内的建设中所获的成就与我国以平等、互敬以及和平共处的原则为基础的独立外交政策。
    贵国政府和我国政府以及越来越多的其他国家所遵循的这一政策，在今天是唯一代替把世界分为集团的政策，而把世界分为集团的政策使全世界经常处在紧张的状态，无疑地迟早将使全世界遭到彻底的破坏与毁灭。这种威胁并没有完全消失，但是由于各国人民对于和平政策的支持，却已经大大地缓和了。这就加强了我们的信心：对于这样的政策应不遗余力地继续执行和使其进一步地发展。
    和平解决一切存在的纠纷和加强各国人民间互助合作这一具有建设性的进步原则，在贝尔格莱德的声明中又一次获得了新的证明。南斯拉夫的外交政策过去和现在就一直是以这项原则为基础的。贝尔格莱德声明的更大意义是：它对于在平等基础上发展社会主义国家间相互关系作出有力的新贡献。
    亲爱的同志们，我确信我们两国间和人民间互相支持、互相援助的友好关系将继续向有益我们人民和共同利益的方向逐日发展和加强。
    在为中华人民共和国主席、我们敬爱的毛泽东同志的健康和万寿干杯时，请允许我对于中国人民和中华人民共和国的进一步发展与繁荣表示衷心的祝贺。
