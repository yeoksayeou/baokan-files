Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions

    After the "Reader's Letters Column" published the letter "Important Instructions Without an Official Seal" on October 10th, the General Office of the Electrical Industry Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building inspected the matter, criticized the personnel involved, and decided to learn from this experience and strengthen the system of receiving and sending official documents. The Shenyang Battery Factory also sent a letter to review their careless work style.

    After the "Reader's Letters Column" published the article "Opposing a Careless Attitude Towards Confidentiality Work" on August 21st, the First Engineering Office of the Engineering Company of the Ministry of Light Industry issued a circular to the departments that lost classified documents during the office relocation, criticizing them. The Cangxian Branch of the China Oils and Fats Company has given a demerit to Duan Shutian, a storage and transportation clerk who read classified documents on the train, and used this incident to conduct confidentiality education for all employees.

    After the "Reader's Letters Column" published the letter of criticism "Classified Documents Must Not Be Sent by Ordinary Mail" on September 18th, the Jixi Mining Bureau Transportation and Sales Department sent a letter stating that they accept the criticism and have decided to improve the method of sending classified documents in the future.

    The Political Department of the Ministry of Railways wrote: The criticism of Li Ruitang, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Central South Design Branch, in the letter "A Neglectful 'Traveler'" published in the "Reader's Letters Column" on September 28th is completely correct. Li Ruitang is not only extremely numb politically and derelict in his duties, but also committed serious errors in other matters. We have decided to give him a dismissal punishment.

    After the "Reader's Letters Column" published the letter of criticism "Two Tractors Slept for a Year" on September 28th, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Agriculture has made a review. At present, the construction scale of the Liangping State Farm has been determined. The farm is actively carrying out land consolidation and the construction of bridges, roads, warehouses, etc. The problem of machine oil has also been solved, and the tractors have been put into intensive autumn plowing work.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    十月十日“读者来信专页”发表了“没有盖公章的重要指示”一信以后，第一机械工业部电器工业管理局办公室已检查了这件事情，对有关人员进行了批评，并且决定从中吸取教训，加强公文的收发管理制度。沈阳电池厂也来信检讨了他们粗枝大叶的工作作风。
    八月二十一日“读者来信专页”发表了“反对用漫不经心的态度对待保密工作”一文后，轻工业部工程公司第一工程处对迁移办公室时丢失密件的各科室，已经发通报提出批评。中国油脂公司沧县分公司已经给在火车上阅读机密文件的储运科员段书田以记过处分，并且通过这件事情向全体工作人员进行保密教育。
    九月十八日“读者来信专页”发表了“机密文件不许用平信寄递”的批评信后，鸡西矿务局运销处已来信表示接受批评，并决定今后改进机密文件的寄递办法。
    铁道部政治部来信：九月二十八日“读者来信专页”发表了“一个玩忽职守的‘旅行家’”一信，对中南设计分局政治处副主任李瑞堂的批评是完全正确的。李瑞堂不仅在政治上极端麻痹，在工作上玩忽职守，而且在其他问题上也犯有严重错误。我们已经决定给以撤职处分。
    九月二十八日“读者来信专页”发表了“两台拖拉机睡了一年觉”的批评信以后，四川省农业厅已经作了检讨。目前，国营梁平农场的建场规模已经决定，农场正在积极进行土地整理和桥梁、道路、仓库等的修建工作，机器用油问题也已经解决，拖拉机已投入紧张的秋耕工作。
