　　Cherish All Draught Animals

    A strange phenomenon has recently emerged in the LinYi District of Shandong Province: a large ox is not as valuable as a pig. In the autumn of 1954, a calf in Canshan County was worth 50 yuan, but now it is only worth 25 yuan. A calf in the Victory Agricultural Production Cooperative in Pingyi County was sold for only 7 yuan. Another farmer had an ox that no one would buy for 25 yuan. After the ox died of illness, selling its hide and meat brought in 32 yuan. It is said that one of the reasons for this situation is that as agricultural production cooperatives have developed, they have become large and wealthy, preferring large livestock to small livestock, and therefore are "selling the weak to buy the strong."
    Is it true that after a cooperative is established and becomes large, smaller and weaker livestock cannot be used? No, that is not the case. So why is this phenomenon of "selling the weak to buy the strong" happening? This is because some cooperative cadres have forgotten the principle of diligence and thrift in running the cooperative and only want to develop rapidly. Therefore, they disregard existing conditions and only want large livestock. The cooperatives push out small livestock, and the members have to sell their small livestock. When there are more livestock on the market, prices continue to fall, and there have even been instances of slaughtering livestock. If this continues, who will suffer the losses? It will be the cooperatives and their members. We should educate all cooperative cadres to cherish all draught animals and make full use of them.

### 要爱护一切耕畜

　　要爱护一切耕畜
    山东省临沂专区，最近出现了一个不合理的现象：一头大牛赶不上一口猪值钱。一九五四年秋天，苍山县一头小牛五十元，现在只值二十五元。平邑县胜利农业生产合作社的一头小牛，只卖了七元。另一个农民有一头牛，卖价二十五元没人要，等牛病死了，卖皮卖肉还得了三十二元。据说，发生这种情况的原因之一，是由于农业生产合作社发展了，家大业大，只要大牲口，不要小牲口，因此纷纷“卖弱买强”。
    是不是建了社，社大了，弱些的小些的牲口就使用不上了呢？不是的。那末为什么发生了这种“卖弱买强”的现象呢？这是由于有些社干部，忘掉了勤俭办社的方针，只想大发展。于是，离开了现有的条件，只要大牲口。合作社往外推小牲口，社员们的小牲口只得出卖。市上牲口多了，连续跌价，甚至已经发生宰杀牲口的现象。这样发展下去，究竟谁吃了亏呢？还是合作社和社员。我们应当教育一切社干部，要爱护一切耕畜，加以充分利用。
