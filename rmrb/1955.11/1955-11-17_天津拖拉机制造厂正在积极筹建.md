　　Tianjin Tractor Factory is Actively Under Construction
    (This newspaper dispatch) The Tianjin Tractor Factory is actively under construction. This factory will be established by merging two larger machine manufacturing plants in Tianjin, and will receive systematic and comprehensive technical assistance from the Soviet Union.
    In order to save construction funds and accelerate the trial manufacture and production of tractors, the majority of the state's investment in this factory will be used to add necessary new machinery and equipment. The existing factory buildings and equipment of the two original machine manufacturing plants will be utilized as much as possible. Since September this year, the engineering and technical personnel in charge of the design department have been working intensively on preliminary expansion designs, studying the arrangement of factory buildings, planning the layout of machinery and equipment, and formulating and dividing the processes for manufacturing tractors.
    Currently, the staff of the Tianjin Tractor Factory Preparatory Office are negotiating cooperation issues with factories and enterprises in more than a dozen regions, including Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Shenyang. According to preliminary investigations, many components such as tractor oil filters, diesel filters, small generators, as well as rubber and asbestos products, can be undertaken by existing factories and enterprises in Tianjin.

　　天津拖拉机制造厂正在积极筹建
    本报讯　天津拖拉机制造厂正在积极筹建。这个工厂将由天津市两个规模较大的机器制造厂合并成立，并将得到苏联的系统全面的技术帮助。
    为了节省建设资金，加速拖拉机的试制和生产，国家对这个工厂的投资绝大部分将用在增添必要的新机器设备上，原有的两个机器制造厂的厂房和设备将尽量加以利用。从今年九月份开始，负责设计部门的工程技术人员便紧张地进行初步扩大设计，研究厂房的安排，计划机器设备的布置，制定和划分制造拖拉机的工序等工作。
    现在，天津拖拉机制造厂筹备处的工作人员正同天津、北京、上海、武汉、沈阳等十多个地区的工厂企业洽商协作问题。据初步调查，拖拉机的机油滤清器、柴油滤清器、小型发电机以及橡胶、石棉制品等许多机件，天津市现有的工厂企业都能承做。
