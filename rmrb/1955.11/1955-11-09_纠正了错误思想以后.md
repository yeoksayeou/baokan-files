Efforts to Fulfill and Overfulfill the 1955 Plan

    After Correcting Erroneous Thinking
    Zhou Qun

    From October 5th to 8th, the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee held a conference of basic construction cadres. After severely criticizing the erroneous thinking of departmentalism in basic construction work, it began to reverse the situation of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company's failure to complete its plan in the first nine months of this year.

    In the past three quarters, the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company only completed 54.4 percent of the original annual planned workload, and 73.8 percent of the revised planned workload. The completion of engineering projects was even worse, only completing 42 percent of the plan. Some key projects, such as the refractory materials factory and the slag cement factory, which should have been completed in the second quarter, have not yet been fully completed. The Dagushan crushing and screening plant and the No. 2 mixer furnace of the No. 1 steelmaking plant were also not completed according to plan. Reducing costs and increasing labor productivity lagged far behind national requirements. As of September 20th, a total of 2,459 quality accidents had occurred, 333 of which were major. The losses caused by quality accidents are difficult to estimate. The third quarter is the best construction season, but the completed workload was only 84.4 percent of the quarterly work plan, and eleven of the thirteen major projects did not meet the schedule.

    The failure to complete the plan for three consecutive quarters was not because the planned targets were too high, but because: 1. Many leading staff members held an erroneous attitude of getting by with regard to completing the state plan. They said, "Whenever it is completed, that's when it counts." "Do it to there, calculate it to there." "If it's not completed today, it's not too late to complete it tomorrow." 2. Many leading staff members lacked an overall concept, and coordination and cooperation were extremely poor, with the phenomenon of mutual "buck-passing" being widespread and serious. Some even believed that "without departmentalism, the plan cannot be completed" and "without buck-passing, one will suffer." Each unit only did the big tasks, ignoring small projects that were of little value but were often key conditions for the construction of other units, making the comprehensive construction operation plan of many projects a mere formality. When the construction site director convened a construction balance meeting to arrange the construction progress, the professional construction teams bargained with each other. Some people did not acknowledge what they said at the meeting; some people overturned what they said today the next day. Some grassroots leading staff members even adopted a "retaliatory" attitude: if your departmentalism affects my construction, I will affect you too. 3. The bureaucratic work style of leaders at all levels was serious. Someone described it this way: the manager sits in the office, the construction site director does not go to the site, the foreman does not lead the construction, and the team leader does not participate in production. Some engineering companies and construction site directors did not even know the progress of the projects they were working on. When building the three major projects such as the large rolling mill, the section chiefs and construction site directors could personally participate in inspecting the quality and carrying out the handover of the foundation engineering. Now these tasks are done by the foremen. Therefore, some workers criticized: the leading cadres treat the engineering tasks as you tell him, and he tells him, and after telling him, the matter is considered done. 4. The party's political and ideological work was weak, and labor competitions had not been carried out well; the party organization had not corrected many ideas and behaviors that violated the party's principles for a long time.

    At this basic construction cadre conference convened by the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee, the responsible comrade of the CPC Liaoning Provincial Committee severely criticized the above-mentioned errors, exposed the losses caused to the state by departmentalism, and demanded that the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the design institute, and all grassroots units must conscientiously overcome existing shortcomings, act tensely, and strive to comprehensively fulfill this year's basic construction plan. This meeting made many leading staff members realize that the main reason for failing to complete the plan in the past was a political and ideological problem, not a technical problem. After the meeting, all basic construction party committees convened meetings, and party organizations at each construction site convened political work meetings including representatives of the construction unit and the design institute, and cadres of the general contracting unit and various subcontracting units to conscientiously implement the resolutions of the municipal party committee's basic construction cadre meeting. By October 15th, all construction sites had convened employee meetings to mobilize.

    This meeting convened by the CPC Anshan Municipal Committee once again proves that strengthening the party committee's leadership over basic construction work is a necessary condition for ensuring the completion of the plan. Now, many leading staff members have strengthened their sense of political responsibility for completing the state plan and criticized their erroneous thinking. Li Yanxin, section chief of the wheel casting section of the No. 2 steelmaking plant, and Song Wanfang, foreman of the metal structure installation team, who had consciously hindered each other in construction for a long time in the past, have now made self-criticisms, and both said that they will cooperate well in the future. In the past, the leading staff members of the chemical engineering site lacked the spirit of cooperation the most, but after they made self-criticisms at the political work meeting, they solved more than 30 long-standing "buck-passing" problems within three days, some of which were problems that the construction site director and the manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company had ordered to be solved many times but had not been solved.

    On the basis of criticizing erroneous thinking, all units actively explored work potential, re-arranged the construction progress, and revised the work plan for the fourth quarter. According to statistics, the workload increased by the engineering companies in the revised plan has reached about 20 percent of the workload of the Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company in the fourth quarter. The start and completion times of some key projects have also been moved forward. After revising the plan, the No. 2 Mining Construction Engineering Company increased the workload by more than 10 percent of the annual plan. The newly added workload of the blast furnace construction and installation engineering company is more than twice the original plan. According to the newly arranged construction progress, the fifth automatic blast furnace can be put into production one month ahead of schedule. According to the estimation of the Basic Construction Planning Department of Anshan Iron and Steel Construction Company, after all construction units have generally explored their potential, as long as the organization and leadership work quickly catches up, the completion of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction plan this year will be guaranteed.

    纠正了错误思想以后
    周群
    十月五日到八日，中共鞍山市委召开了基本建设干部大会，严厉批判了基本建设工作中的本位主义等错误思想以后，开始扭转了鞍山钢铁建设公司今年前九个月完不成计划的局面。
    在过去的三个季度里，鞍山钢铁建设公司只完成原定全年计划工作量的百分之五十四点四，完成修正后计划工作量的百分之七十三点八；工程项目完成得更差，只完成了计划的百分之四十二。有些重点工程，如第二季度应完工的耐火材料厂和水渣厂等，至今没有全部完工。大孤山破碎筛分场和第一炼钢厂二号混铁炉也没有按计划完工。降低成本和提高劳动生产率更远远落后于国家要求。到九月二十日止，共发生质量事故二千四百五十九次，其中重大的有三百三十三次。由于质量事故所造成的损失难以估计。第三季度是最好的施工季节，但是完成的工作量只有季度作业计划的百分之八十四点四，十三项主要工程竟有十一项没有完成进度计划。
    一连三个季度都没完成计划，并不是因为计划指标过高，而是因为：一、不少领导工作人员对完成国家计划抱着得过且过的错误态度。他们说：“什么时候完成，什么时候算。”“作到那里，算到那里。”“今天完不成，明天完成也不算晚。”二、不少领导工作人员没有整体观念，配合协作极差，互相“扯皮”现象普遍而严重。有人甚至认为“不本位，就完成不了计划”，“不扯皮，就要吃亏”。各单位只干大头活，忽视价值小但是对其他单位施工往往是关键条件的小项目，使很多工程的综合施工作业计划流于形式。工地主任召开施工平衡会议安排施工进度的时候，各专业施工队互相讨价还价。有的人在会上说了话，不认账；有的人今天说了话，第二天就推翻。有的基层领导工作人员竟采取“报复”的态度：你本位影响了我施工，我也影响影响你。三、各级领导工作人员的官僚主义作风严重。有人这样形容说：经理坐机关，工地主任不下现场，工长不领导施工，组长不参加生产。有的工程公司和工地主任甚至连自己正在施工的工程进度都不知道。建筑大型轧钢厂等三大工程的时候，工段长、工地主任都能自己动手参加检查质量，进行基础工程的交工工作。现在这些工作都由工长来做。因此有的工人批评说：领导干部对待工程任务就是你告诉他，他再告诉他，告诉完了，事情也就算完了。四、党的政治思想工作薄弱，劳动竞赛一直没有很好地开展起来；对许多违反党的原则的思想和行为，党组织长期不加以纠正。
    在中共鞍山市委会召开的这一次基本建设干部大会上，中共辽宁省委负责同志严厉批判了上述各种错误，揭露了本位主义给国家造成的损失，要求鞍山钢铁建设公司、鞍山钢铁公司、设计院、以及各基层单位都必须认真克服现有的缺点，紧张地行动起来，努力全面地完成今年的基本建设计划。这次会议使许多领导工作人员认识到：过去完不成计划的主要原因是政治思想问题，而不是技术问题。会后，各基本建设党委都召开了会议，各个工地由党组织召开了包括建设单位和设计院代表、施工的总承包单位和各分包单位干部参加的政治工作会议，认真执行市委基本建设干部会议的决议。到十月十五日，各工地都已召开职工大会进行了动员。
    中共鞍山市委召开的这次会议再一次证明：加强党委对基本建设工作的领导，是保证完成计划的必要条件。现在，许多领导工作人员加强了完成国家计划的政治责任感，批判了自己的错误思想。第二炼钢厂车铸工段段长李延馨和金属结构安装队工长宋万芳，过去在施工中长期有意识地互相妨碍，现在都作了自我批评，两人并表示今后要搞好协作。过去，化工工地的领导工作人员最缺乏协作精神，但是他们在政治工作会上进行了自我批判以后，三天内就解决了三十多件长期没有解决的“扯皮”问题，其中有的是工地主任和鞍山钢铁建设公司经理曾多次下命令都没有解决的问题。
    在批判错误思想的基础上，各单位都积极挖掘了工作潜力，重新安排了施工进度，修订了第四季度的工作计划。据统计，各工程公司在修订计划中增加的工作量，已达到鞍山钢铁建设公司第四季度工作量的百分之二十左右。有些重点工程的开工建设时间和完工时间也都提前了。第二矿山建筑工程公司修订计划后，增加了占全年计划百分之十以上的工作量。高炉建筑安装工程公司新增加的工作量比原计划多两倍，根据新安排的施工进度，第五座自动化高炉可以提前一个月投入生产。据鞍山钢铁建设公司基本建设计划处估计：各施工单位普遍挖掘了潜力以后，只要组织领导工作很快跟上去，鞍钢今年基本建设计划的完成就有保证。
