Public-Private Joint Factories Significantly Increased This Year

　　(Our Newspaper) News: Public-private joint industrial enterprises have greatly developed in various regions this year. According to statistics from twelve major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, 617 private factories have formally implemented public-private joint ownership in the first three quarters of this year. After mergers and reorganizations, 398 public-private joint factories were established. Only 793 public-private joint factories were expanded nationwide last year.

　　The Shanghai Municipal People's Committee has approved 293 private factories to implement public-private joint ownership this year. As of the end of October, more than 220 have been formally combined. In Tianjin, 197 private factories formally became public-private joint enterprises in the first nine months of this year; all private factories in the city with more than 500 employees have fully implemented public-private joint ownership, and the vast majority of private factories with more than 100 employees have also become public-private joint enterprises. Many medium-sized cities in Hebei, Shandong, and Liaoning have also implemented public-private joint ownership in large numbers of private factories this year. More than 110 private industrial enterprises in Shandong Province have successively become public-private joint enterprises this year. By the third quarter, Hebei Province had approved 70 private industrial enterprises to implement public-private joint ownership, exceeding the original annual plan by 11.86 percent. Public-private joint factories have all demonstrated the superiority of the advanced form of state capitalism.

　　The notable feature of this year's expansion of public-private joint industrial work is that many regions have adopted the method of industry-wide public-private joint ownership and combined joint ownership. In Shanghai, eight industries in the light industry sector, including cotton spinning, wool spinning, papermaking, cigarette making, enamel, flour milling, and rice milling, have implemented industry-wide public-private joint ownership; in the heavy industry sector, private factories producing ships, power boilers, electrical appliances, machinery, auto parts, cement, dyes, and stone powder, totaling thirteen types of products, have been reorganized and merged according to product type. Beijing's private flour milling industry has implemented industry-wide public-private joint ownership. The silk industry in Zhejiang Province, among others, is implementing industry-wide public-private joint ownership. While organizing individual joint ventures, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Shandong, and other places have also organized a group of private factories to merge and cooperate in accordance with the principles of large enterprises leading small ones and advanced enterprises leading backward ones.

　　In organizing private factories to carry out industry-wide public-private joint ownership and combined joint ownership, the aforementioned regions have all conducted unified planning and production reorganization of relevant industries or enterprises in accordance with the needs of national economic construction, making the use of human and material resources within industries, between enterprises, and even between industries more reasonable, creating favorable conditions for developing production and further carrying out socialist transformation. For example, most private wool textile factories in Shanghai are not all-inclusive factories, and the machinery and equipment for spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing are also unbalanced and unreasonable, relying on each other for processing, involving each other, and wasting a great deal. After industry-wide public-private joint ownership and combined reorganization, most of them, with the exception of a few factories, became all-inclusive factories for spinning, weaving, dyeing, and finishing. Shanghai's flour industry had surplus factory buildings and equipment, and had been losing money year after year in the past; the rice milling industry had insufficient equipment, was scattered and backward, and could not meet processing requirements. After the unified reorganization and merger of the rice and flour industries, the situation of the flour industry losing money year after year due to overcapacity has been changed, and the rice milling industry has also been freed from the state of being scattered and backward, enabling it to increase production and reduce costs. Although the Yongxing Pipe Drawing and Steel Rolling Mill in Tianjin had good equipment and a large amount of capital in the past, it could only operate for a maximum of about ten days a month on average because its products did not meet the needs; although De Cheng Iron Factory and Kunshan Iron Factory could manufacture bicycle wheel rims, they did not have working capital, could not buy raw materials, and often failed to complete orders from state-owned commercial departments. In the past, these three private factories were constantly losing money. In March and September of this year, the three factories were successively merged to form the First United Vehicle Parts Factory, a public-private joint venture, using the raw materials and steel rolling equipment of the original Yongxing Pipe Drawing and Steel Rolling Mill and the equipment of De Cheng and Kunshan Iron Factories to manufacture bicycle wheel rims. In the second and third quarters, it earned more than 20,000 yuan in profits. Employees, technicians, and substantive personnel from the capitalist side of private factories that implemented industry-wide public-private joint ownership and combined joint ownership in various regions have all been reasonably arranged, and because personnel are concentrated, they can be divided according to their respective expertise, thus better playing their skills. After many private factories were merged and cooperated, the workers were concentrated, and the strength of the Party, the League, and the Trade Union was strengthened compared with the past. Some also began to implement labor insurance regulations, enlivening cultural, recreational, and sports activities. Organizing private factories to implement industry-wide public-private joint ownership and combined joint ownership has also reduced the number of cadres and investments that the state has to send to public-private joint factories.

### 公私合营工厂今年显著增加

　　公私合营工厂今年显著增加
    本报讯　今年各地公私合营工业有很大发展。据北京、天津、上海等十二个大城市的统计，今年前三个季度已经有六百一十七个私营工厂正式实行公私合营，经过合并改组，成立了三百九十八个公私合营工厂。去年一年全国各地扩展的公私合营工厂，也仅有七百九十三个。
    上海市人民委员会已经批准二百九十三个私营工厂在今年实行公私合营，到十月底，正式合营的已经有二百二十多个。天津市今年前九个月有一百九十七个私营工厂正式公私合营；全市五百人以上的私营工厂已经全部实行公私合营，一百人以上的私营工厂，绝大部分也公私合营了。河北、山东、辽宁等地的许多中等城市，今年也有大批私营工厂实行公私合营。山东省今年已经有一百一十多个私营工业企业先后公私合营。河北省到第三季度止，共批准七十户私营工业企业实行公私合营，超过原定全年计划百分之十一点八六。公私合营的工厂，都显示了国家资本主义高级形式的优越性。
    今年扩展公私合营工业工作的显著特点，是不少地区采取了全行业公私合营、合并合营的办法。上海市轻工业方面的棉纺、毛纺、造纸、卷烟、搪瓷、面粉、碾米等八个行业都实行全行业公私合营；重工业方面生产船舶、动力锅炉、电器、机器、汽车配件、水泥、染料、石粉等十三种产品的私营工厂，按产品实行改组、合营。北京市私营面粉工业已经实行全行业公私合营。浙江省丝绸业等都在实行全行业公私合营。天津、广州、沈阳、山东等地在组织单独合营的同时，也按照以大带小、以先进带落后等原则，组织一批私营工厂合并合营。
    上述地区在组织私营工厂进行全行业公私合营、合并合营中，都根据国家经济建设的需要，对有关行业或企业进行了统一规划和生产改组，使行业内部、企业之间，以至行业之间人力物力的使用更为合理，为发展生产和进一步进行社会主义改造创造了有利条件。如上海市毛纺业私营工厂大部分是非全能厂，纺、织、染整的机器设备也不平衡、不合理，彼此依赖加工，互相牵涉，浪费很大。经过全行业公私合营、合并改组，除个别厂外，绝大部分就成为纺、织、染整的全能工厂。上海市面粉业厂房、设备有余，过去年年亏本；碾米业设备不足，分散落后，不能适应加工要求。米面两业统一改组、合并合营以后，面粉业因为生产能力过剩而历年亏损的局面得到改变，碾米业也摆脱了分散落后的状态，能够增加生产和降低成本。天津市永兴拔管轧钢厂过去虽有很好的设备和大量资金，但是因为产品不适合需要，一个月平均最多只能开车十天左右；德成铁工厂、昆山铁工厂虽能制造自行车瓦圈，但是没有流动资金，买不到原料，经常完不成国营商业部门的定货任务。过去这三个私营工厂都经常赔钱。今年三月和九月间，这三个厂先后合并，组成公私合营第一联合车具厂，利用原永兴拔管轧钢厂的原料、轧钢设备和德成、昆山两铁工厂的制造瓦圈的设备，生产自行车瓦圈。在二、三两季度，共获得两万多元的利润。各地实行全行业公私合营、合并合营的私营工厂职工、技术人员和资方实职人员等都得到合理安排，并且由于人员集中，能够根据各人特长进行分工，因而更好地发挥了他们的技能。许多私营工厂合并合营以后，工人集中，党、团、工会的力量都较前加强，有的还开始实施了劳动保险条例，活跃了文娱体育活动。组织私营工厂实行全行业公私合营、合并合营，也减少了国家向公私合营工厂派干部和投资的数量。
