Double-tracking construction on the whole lines and sections with insufficient transport capacity of seven major railway trunk lines, as stipulated in China's First Five-Year Plan, has now seen the completion of the entire double-tracking from Beijing to Shanhaiguan and from Shenyang to Shanhaiguan. The entire double-tracking project from Changchun to Dalian and the section double-tracking project between Beijing and Hankou have also recently commenced. Workers at the four construction sites north and south of Baoding on the Beijing-Hankou line have already completed the pile driving for the new bridges. The section south of Taipingshan on the Changchun-Dalian line, spanning more than 50 kilometers, has also begun track laying. In addition, the section double-tracking project from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan is undergoing construction preparations, while the section double-tracking of the Beijing-Baotou line and the Longhai line are also under design.

After these double-tracking projects are completed, they will play a significant role in improving China's transport capacity and fulfilling transport tasks. Among them, the transport capacity of the Jinzhou-Dahushan section of the Shenyang-Shanhaiguan line alone can be increased by 88.9 percent. The Beijing-Hankou line section double-tracking and the Changchun-Dalian line double-tracking, etc., which were started ahead of schedule recently, are all major arteries connecting several major trunk lines, running through several provinces, supporting key construction projects, and having direct connections with water-land intermodal transport and international through transport.

　　全国七条主要铁路的全线和区段修建复线
    我国第一个五年计划规定的在七条主要铁路干线的全线和运输能力不足的区段修建的复线，现在已经有北京到山海关和沈阳到山海关的全线复线全部完成，长春到大连的全线复线和北京到汉口间的区段复线工程也在最近开工。京汉线保定南北四个工地上的工人，目前已经完成了新建桥梁的打桩任务。长（春）大（连）线太平山以南五十多公里的地段也已经开始铺轨。此外石家庄到太原的区段复线工程正在做施工准备，京包线和陇海线的区段复线也在设计中。
    这些复线修通以后，对提高我国运输能力和完成运输任务将起重大作用。其中仅沈山线的锦州到大虎山间的运输通过能力就可以提高百分之八十八点九。最近提前施工的京汉线区段复线和长大线复线等，都是连接着几条主要干线，贯穿数省和支援重点建设，并同水陆联运、国际联运有直接关系的大动脉。                 （人民铁道报编辑部）
