Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 19th: The socialist transformation of Shanghai's private industry by the state has entered a new stage. Each industrial sector in the city is formulating comprehensive transformation plans industry by industry. The implementation of joint public-private ownership across entire industries—an advanced form of state capitalism—has become the primary method for carrying out the socialist transformation of Shanghai's private industry. A large number of specialized companies are preparing to be established to lead the transformation of entire industries. Tens of thousands of private factories will undergo necessary economic reorganization and production reforms by industry, creating conditions for joint public-private ownership across entire industries. This year, the output value of Shanghai's joint public-private industrial enterprises has already accounted for 45% of the total output value of the original private industry, and there will be even greater development next year.

Shanghai's private industrial output value accounts for about half of the country's private industrial output value. As of September this year, the number of joint public-private industrial enterprises in the city has increased to 326. The output value of private factories accepting state processing orders has accounted for more than 90% of the city's total private industrial output value.

Since the beginning of this year, with the development of socialist industrialization and the arrival of the high tide of agricultural cooperativization, the work of expanding joint public-private industry in Shanghai has reached an unprecedented scale, developing from individual joint public-private ownership in the past to joint public-private ownership across entire industries, and from a single factory's joint public-private ownership to the merger of many factories into joint public-private ownership. Among the joint public-private factories, there are both large and small factories, with the number of employees ranging from more than 1,000 to dozens, or even less than 15. In the process of joint public-private ownership across entire industries, Shanghai's private cotton spinning, wool spinning, hemp spinning, cigarette, paper making, enamel, flour milling, and rice milling industries reorganized 165 private factories into 103 joint public-private factories using methods such as unified planning, large factories leading small factories, and advanced factories leading backward factories. After such planning, most of the factories in the wool spinning and enamel industries have been reorganized from non-comprehensive factories into comprehensive factories. In the paper making and cigarette industries, the original small factories with simple equipment and backward technology have been merged into large factories, and the appearance of production and management has been completely renewed. After the flour milling and rice milling industries implemented joint public-private ownership through industry-wide mergers, they overcame the difficulties of perennial losses caused by excessive equipment in Shanghai's flour industry, and also changed the situation in the rice milling industry where the equipment was insufficient to meet Shanghai's needs.

The factories in Shanghai that have implemented joint public-private ownership this year also include 187 factories in heavy industry producing more than a dozen products such as machine forging, thread milling, power boilers, electrical appliances, cement, dyes, stone powder, paint making, telecommunications, and auto parts. Most of these factories are small factories that are mutually dependent in production, so they were merged into 53 factories by product type in the joint public-private ownership. After the merger of five small factories in the machine forging industry, the scrap rate has been reduced from the original 1.5% to 0.5% due to the concentration of equipment and technical strength; the cost has also been reduced by 12% due to the reduction in the number of processing steps.

While carrying out joint public-private ownership work, Shanghai has strengthened its leadership over private industry. The five industrial bureaus of the Municipal People's Committee have established dozens of specialized divisions, and some have established specialized companies, which have arranged the production of private factories according to the policy of "overall planning and comprehensive consideration."

Currently, the various leading departments in Shanghai are systematically summarizing the experience of carrying out the socialist transformation of private industry in recent years, especially the experience of joint public-private ownership across eight industries, the merger of joint public-private ownership by product, and the establishment of specialized companies this year, in order to prepare in all aspects for a larger-scale transformation of private industry next year.

This newspaper, Wuhan, 19th: This year, 34 private factories in Wuhan have successively implemented joint public-private ownership. Including the original ones, there are now 57 private factories in the city under joint public-private ownership, including all 12 industries such as machine manufacturing, matches, paper making, and cigarette making. The output value of these factories accounts for 97% of the total output value of private factories in the city, and the number of employees accounts for 52%.

Among these factories, many have undergone merged joint public-private ownership and have reformed production according to national needs. For example, the joint public-private ownership of the Kaiming Machinery Factory is composed of 17 small factories, including four foundry factories, four red furnace workshops, one model factory, and eight machine repair shops, which could not manufacture complete sets of machines in the past. After the joint public-private ownership, the equipment of these 17 factories was adjusted, and four workshops were established, and they began to produce complete sets of equipment. This year, they cooperated with local state-owned factories to specialize in the production of agricultural machinery, and successfully trial-produced locomotive boilers, carding machines, gas power machines, and dipping equipment, and began to accept orders and produce in large quantities.

### 上海私营工业的改造进入新阶段　武汉市已有五十七个私营工厂公私合营

　　上海私营工业的改造进入新阶段
　　武汉市已有五十七个私营工厂公私合营
    新华社上海十九日电　国家对上海私营工业的社会主义改造，已经进入一个新的阶段。全市各个工业部门正在逐行逐业地拟订全面改造的规划。实行全行业的公私合营——国家资本主义的高级形式——已经成为目前对上海私营工业进行社会主义改造的主要形式。领导全行业改造的大批专业公司正在准备成立，几万家私营工厂将按行业进行必要的经济改组和生产改革，为全行业公私合营创造条件。今年上海市公私合营工业的产值，已经占到原有私营工业总产值的百分之四十五，明年度就将有更大的发展。
    上海市私营工业产值约占全国私营工业产值的一半。到今年九月份止，全市公私合营工业企业已经增加到三百二十六户；接受国家加工订货的私营工厂的产值，已经占到全市私营工业总产值的百分之九十以上。
    今年以来，随着社会主义工业化的发展和农业合作化高潮的到来，上海市扩展公私合营工业的工作具有了前所未有的规模，由过去个别的公私合营发展到全行业的公私合营，由一个厂单独公私合营发展为许多厂合并公私合营。公私合营的工厂中既有大厂，也有小厂，厂里的职工人数多的一千人以上，少的几十人以至十五人以下。上海市私营棉纺、毛纺、麻纺、卷烟、造纸、搪瓷、面粉、碾米等八个行业在全行业公私合营的过程中，用统一规划、大厂带小厂、先进厂带落后厂的方法把一百六十五个私营工厂改组成为一百零三个公私合营工厂。毛纺、搪瓷等行业的工厂，经过这样的规划以后，多数都由非全能工厂改组成了全能工厂。造纸、卷烟等行业中原有的设备简陋、技术落后的小厂并入大厂后，生产和管理工作的面貌都焕然一新。面粉、碾米两个行业实行全行业合并公私合营后，克服了上海面粉业因为设备过剩而造成的历年亏损的困难，也改变了碾米业因为设备不足而不能适应上海需要的局面。
    今年上海市实行公私合营的工厂，还包括重工业中生产机锻、铣牙、动力锅炉、电器、水泥、染料、石粉、造漆、电讯、汽车配件等十多种产品的一百八十七个工厂。这些工厂多数是在生产上相互依赖的小厂，因此在公私合营中按产品种类被合并为五十三个工厂。机锻业五个小厂合并以后，由于设备和技术力量集中，废品率已经由原来的百分之一点五降低到百分之零点五；由于往返加工层次的减少，成本也降低了百分之十二。
    在进行公私合营工作的同时，上海市加强了对私营工业的领导。市人民委员会的五个工业局成立了几十个专业处，有的成立了专业公司，根据“统筹兼顾”的政策，安排了私营工厂的生产。
    现在，上海市各个领导部门正在系统地总结几年来对私营工业进行社会主义改造的经验，特别是今年八个行业的全行业公私合营、按产品合并公私合营以及成立专业公司的经验，从各个方面为明年更大规模地改造私营工业作好准备。
    本报武汉十九日电　武汉市今年有三十四个私营工厂先后实行公私合营，连原有的在内，全市已有五十七个私营工厂公私合营，其中有机器制造、火柴、造纸、卷烟等十二个行业全部公私合营。这些工厂的产值，占全市私营工厂总产值百分之九十七，职工人数占百分之五十二。
    在这些工厂中，有许多进行了合并公私合营，并按照国家需要来改革生产。如公私合营开明机器厂是由十七家小工厂组成的。其中有四家翻砂厂、四家红炉房、一家模型厂和八家机器修配厂，过去都不能制造成套的机器。公私合营后，将这十七家工厂的设备加以调整，成立了四个车间，开始生产成套设备；今年又同地方国营工厂分工，专门生产农业机械，并试制锅驼机、抓绒机、煤气动力机和浸涤设备成功，开始接受订货，大批生产。
