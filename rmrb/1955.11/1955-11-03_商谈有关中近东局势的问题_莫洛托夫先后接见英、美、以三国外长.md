Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, November 2nd, TASS Dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received British Foreign Secretary Macmillan on October 29th, and successively received US Secretary of State Dulles and Israeli Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sharett on October 30th.

    During the talks, the issue of Czechoslovakia's recent sale of weapons to Egypt for its defense needs was discussed.

    In this regard, the Soviet Union steadfastly emphasized that all countries have the sovereignty to be concerned about their legitimate defense needs, and that it is necessary to maintain and consolidate peace in the Middle East. The Soviet Union is ready to facilitate the improvement of direct relations between countries in the region.

    Recently, some Western newspapers have made a big fuss about this issue. This may reflect the dissatisfaction of some Western figures who apparently hope that Egypt will remain under their practical control as it has in the past.

    According to US newspaper reports, an Israeli minister currently in the United States even openly clamored for a preemptive war against Egypt, which seems to prove that the side issuing such aggressive calls is not lacking in weapons.

    It is noteworthy that although officials in some countries are now doing everything possible to emphasize that the situation in the region may become sharply acute, they have not taken measures to study this issue in a normal manner.

    Nor has anyone proposed convening a meeting of the Security Council for this purpose.

    The Geneva press pointed out: The Soviet Union's position on this issue takes into account both Egypt's legitimate right to safeguard its national independence and the need to promote the relaxation of international tensions and improve relations between countries in the region.

    商谈有关中近东局势的问题
    莫洛托夫先后接见英、美、以三国外长
    新华社二日讯　塔斯社日内瓦二日讯：苏联外交部长莫洛托夫十月二十九日接见了英国外交大臣麦克米伦，十月三十日又先后接见了美国国务卿杜勒斯和以色列总理兼外交部长夏里特。
    会谈当中谈到了捷克斯洛伐克最近出售一些武器给埃及以供它的防御需要的问题。
    在这方面，苏联坚定不移地着重指出，各国有关心自己的合理的防御需要的主权，同时维护和巩固中近东地区的和平是必要的，苏联准备促成这个地区各国间的直接关系的改善。
    最近时期，西方国家的某些报纸大事渲染这个问题。可能，这反映了这样一些西方人士的不满情绪，这些人显然希望埃及今后仍然同过去一样，受他们的实际控制。
    据美国报纸消息，现在在美国的一个以色列的部长甚至公开叫嚣对埃及发动先发制人的战争，这似乎可以证明发出这种侵略性叫嚣的那一方面并不是武器不足。
  值得注意的是，某些国家的官方人士尽管现在百般强调这个地区的局势可能急剧尖锐起来，但是他们并没有为能够正常地研究这个问题采取措施。
    也没有一个人为了这一点而提出召开安全理事会会议的建议。
    日内瓦报界指出：苏联在这个问题上的立场是既考虑埃及关心保障自己国家独立的合法权利，又考虑到促进缓和国际紧张局势和改进这个地区的国与国之间的关系的必要。
