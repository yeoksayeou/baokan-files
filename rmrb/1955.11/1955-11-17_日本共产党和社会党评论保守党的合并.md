　　Xinhua News Agency, November 16th: According to Kyodo News, the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on November 16th regarding the merger of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, stating: The greatest aim of establishing the Liberal Democratic Party is to strengthen the Japanese government's dependence on the United States and to obstruct the unity and progress of national forces striving for peace, independence, and democracy. Obviously, through delaying Japan-Soviet negotiations, revising the Constitution, and expanding armaments, reactionary politics will be increasingly forcefully implemented.
    The Japanese Communist Party's statement: "The Japanese Communist Party, together with all democratic forces, will fight to the end against these reactionary attempts."
    Maozaburo Suzuki, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, commented on the merger of the Japanese conservative parties at a press conference on November 15th. When discussing the Hatoyama government's announcement to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet on November 22nd, he said that this extraordinary session of the Diet should not be a meeting to nominate the head of the cabinet, but a meeting to break the deadlock in Japan-Soviet negotiations and Japan-China friendly relations, to deliberate on the guidelines for compiling the budget, and other urgent issues. He said that Hatoyama's attempt to transfer power by this means must be said to be extremely inappropriate.

    The Merger of Two Japanese Conservative Parties
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 16th: The Japanese Democratic Party and the Liberal Party held a meeting in Tokyo on the afternoon of November 15th, announcing the formal merger of the two parties to form the Liberal Democratic Party.
    According to a report by Kyodo News, the policies to be adopted by the Conservative Party after the merger have already been discussed and decided by the policy committee of the "New Party Preparatory Committee" jointly formed by the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party before the merger on November 11th and 12th. Kyodo News pointed out: During the negotiations, "the Democratic Party made considerable concessions to the Liberal Party."
    In terms of foreign policy, the Democratic Party had previously flaunted slogans such as "independence and autonomy" and "restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet relations" in the general election. These slogans, which earned the Democratic Party many votes, are no longer emphasized in the Liberal Democratic Party's program and policies decided by the two parties. They expressed their intention to strengthen the so-called "cooperative system with free countries"; at the same time, they only vaguely stated that "the normalization and even adjustment of relations with countries with which diplomatic relations have not been restored" would be pursued. On the issue of relations with the Soviet Union, they raised many demands as preconditions for concluding a peace treaty. In terms of domestic affairs, the Liberal Democratic Party advocates revising the current Constitution, which prohibits Japan from rearming, and expanding armaments in the name of "rectifying and strengthening the self-defense system."
    Due to the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party competing for leadership after the merger, the candidate for the president of the Liberal Democratic Party, which had been in dispute for a long time, has not been decided, and will have to wait until the election in April next year. Before that, Ichiro Hatoyama (former president of the Democratic Party), Taketora Ogata (former president of the Liberal Party), Bukichi Miki (former chairman of the Democratic Party's General Affairs Council), and Banboku Ohno (former chairman of the Liberal Party's General Affairs Council), who were elected by the founding congress, will act as co-presidents. Former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, who originally belonged to the Liberal Party, has formally stated that he will not participate in the merged Liberal Democratic Party.
    The Hatoyama cabinet will carry out a general resignation on the 21st, and convene an extraordinary session of the Diet on the 22nd to form a new conservative cabinet.
    According to a dispatch from Washington by Kyodo News special correspondent Iwadate, U.S. government officials who are concerned about the political situation in Japan welcome the move to establish a new conservative party in Japan. However, Iwadate pointed out: the U.S. side does not think that "they can be completely optimistic." They expressed concern about "whether the new party can maintain a consistent pace and whether it can gain widespread support from the Japanese people."

　　日本共产党和社会党评论保守党的合并
    据新华社十六日讯　据共同社消息：日本共产党十一月十六日就民主党和自由党的合并发表声明说：成立自由民主党的最大目的，在于加强日本政府对美国的从属，阻挠争取和平、独立、民主的国民力量的统一和前进。显然，通过拖延日苏谈判、修改宪法、扩张军备等，将会愈益强制推行反动政治。
    日本共产党声明：“日本共产党要和一切民主力量一道，同这些反动企图斗争到底。”
    日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎十一月十五日在记者招待会上评论了日本保守政党的合并。他在谈到鸠山政府宣布要在十一月二十二日召开国会临时会议时说，这次国会临时会议不应该是提名组阁首长的会议，而应该是打开日苏谈判和日中友好关系的僵局、审议编制预算的方针以及其他紧急问题的会议。他说，鸠山企图借此转移政权，必须说是非常不适当的。日本两个保守政党实行合并
    据新华社十六日讯　东京消息：日本民主党和自由党十一月十五日下午在东京举行大会，宣告两党正式合并成立自由民主党。
    据共同社报道，保守党合并后将采取的政策已经由民主党和自由党在合并前联合组成的“新党筹备会”的政策委员会在十一月十一日、十二日商谈决定。共同社指出：在谈判中，“民主党向自由党作了相当大的让步”。
    在外交政策方面，民主党过去在大选中曾经标榜“独立自主”、“恢复日中、日苏邦交”等口号，这些使民主党取得了不少选票的口号在两党决定的自由民主党的纲领和政策中已经不再强调。它们表示要加强所谓“同自由国家的合作体制”；同时，只是含糊地表示“要使同未恢复邦交国家的邦交正常化乃至调整关系”，而就在对苏联关系的问题上，它们却提出许多要求作为缔结和约的先决条件。在内政方面，自由民主党主张修改规定禁止日本重新武装的现行宪法，并且要在“整顿充实自卫体制”的名义下扩充军备。
    由于民主党和自由党互相争夺合并后的领导权，争执很久的自由民主党的总裁人选，一直未能决定，要等到明年四月选举产生。在这以前，由成立大会选出的鸠山一郎（前民主党总裁）、绪方竹虎（前自由党总裁）、三木武吉（前民主党总务会长）、大野伴睦（前自由党总务会长）四人代行总裁职务。原来属于自由党的前首相吉田茂已经正式表示不参加合并起来的自由民主党。
    鸠山内阁将在二十一日实行总辞职，并且在二十二日召开国会临时会议，组织新的保守内阁。
    据共同社特派记者岩立自华盛顿发出的消息指出，对日本政局感到不安的美国政府当局人士欢迎日本成立新保守党的动向。但是，岩立指出：美国方面并不认为“可以完全乐观”。它们对于“新党的步调能否一致，是否能得到日本国民普遍的支持”，表示耽心。
