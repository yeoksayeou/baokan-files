Gansu's arid regions have achieved remarkable progress in agricultural capital construction to change the face of drought. From last year to the first half of this year, according to statistics from twenty-seven counties and cities: due to the installation of waterwheels, water pumps, well-digging, and canal construction, the irrigated area has been expanded by more than 240,000 mu. Forty-three thousand mu of land have been irrigated by flood, 729,000 mu of land have had field ridges built and terraced fields constructed, and more than 48,000 mu of trees have been planted. In addition, more than 90,000 mu of alfalfa and sweet clover have been planted, and more than 3 million zhang of tree-planting horizontal ditches have been dug. These efforts have changed the arid landscape in many places, ensuring increased agricultural production. After dry land is converted into irrigated land, the yield per mu generally increases by more than 100 jin of grain on top of the original yield. The land irrigated by flood and the mountain land that has been improved with field ridges generally yields 30 jin more grain per mu. It is estimated that the water conservancy projects and field projects built last year will increase grain production by more than 55.5 million jin this year. After all the projects built last year and in the first half of this year are fully utilized, grain production will increase by 160 million jin next year. At the same time, these efforts also contribute to the great plan to harness the Yellow River, reducing the sediment content and soil erosion of many of the Yellow River's tributaries.

In order to summarize and exchange work experience from various regions, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened the Third Arid Area Work Conference, at which the "Preliminary Opinions on the Fifteen-Year Long-Range Plan for Arid Areas in Gansu Province" were formulated.

　　甘肃干旱地区正在进行改造
    甘肃省干旱地区在进行农业基本建设改变干旱面貌方面取得了显著的成绩。从去年到今年上半年，据二十七个县市统计：由于安装水车、抽水机和打井、开渠等，共扩大灌溉面积二十四万多亩。修洪水漫地四十三万亩，培地埂、修梯田七十二万九千多亩，造林四万八千多亩。此外还种苜蓿、草木樨九万多亩，挖植树水平沟三百多万丈。这些工作改变了许多地方的干旱面貌，保证了农业增产。旱地改成水地后，一亩地一般都要在原有产量基础上增产一百多斤粮食。洪水漫过的田地和经过培修地埂的山地，一亩地一般都要增加三十斤粮食。据估计：去年所修的水利工程和田间工程约使今年增加了五千五百多万斤粮食的收成。去年和今年上半年所修的工程全部利用后，明年将增产粮食一亿六千万斤。同时，这些工作还配合了根治黄河的伟大计划，减少了许多黄河支流的含沙量和水土流失。
    中共甘肃省委为了总结和交流各地的工作经验，于最近召开了第三次干旱地区工作会议，会上并制定了“甘肃省干旱地区十五年远景规划初步意见”。　　　　　（本报驻兰州记者）
