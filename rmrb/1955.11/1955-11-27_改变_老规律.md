　　Changing the "Old Pattern"
    Due to the backwardness of some factory and mining management work, there is often a pattern at the end of each year: on the one hand, the completion of the production plan improves, but on the other hand, the phenomenon of crash production and neglect of safety becomes serious.

    Judging from the situation in Liaoning Province, this "old pattern" has not changed this year. Judging from the statistics of eight products, 40% to 85% of the tasks in October were rushed out in the last ten days. Excessive overtime is rampant in enterprises, and accidents are also frequent. According to statistics from five cities including Shenyang and Anshan, more than 1,000 large and small casualties occurred in October. The Fifth Mining Area of the Cai Tun Coal Mine in Benxi produced more than 7,000 tons less of raw coal in October due to accidents. The accident losses of the Seventh Petroleum Factory in October amounted to more than 200,000 yuan. This not only affects the health and safety of workers, but also disrupts the normal order of enterprises and puts the production of enterprises in a state of chaos and abnormality.

    Therefore, enterprises in various places should pay close attention to preventing the occurrence of this abnormal phenomenon, and strive to complete the plan in a balanced manner to change this "old pattern."

　  改变“老规律”
    由于目前有些厂矿管理工作的落后，每到年末往往有这样的规律，就是：一方面是生产计划完成情况好转了，随之而来的突击现象和忽视安全的情况却严重起来了。
    从辽宁省的情况来看，这个“老规律”今年并未有所改变。从八种产品的统计来看，在十月份一般都有百分之四十到八十五的任务是在下旬突击出来的。企业中滥行加班加点，事故也很频繁。据沈阳鞍山等五个市的统计，十月份发生的大小伤亡事故达一千多次。本溪彩屯煤矿第五采区十月份因事故而少产原煤七千多吨。石油七厂十月份事故损失即达二十多万元之多。这不仅影响到职工的健康和生命的安全，而且也打乱了企业的正常秩序，使企业的生产处于混乱和不正常的状态中。
    因此，各地企业都应该十分注意防止这种不正常现象的发生，努力做到均衡地完成计划，改变这种“老规律”。
