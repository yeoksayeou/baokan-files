　　New Agricultural Cooperatives in Shanxi, Guizhou, Hunan and Other Places Put into Production
　　Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee Holds District Committee Secretary Meeting to Discuss Cooperative Rectification Work
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Newly established agricultural cooperatives in Shanxi, Guizhou, Hunan, and other places have all been put into production in an orderly manner. By the beginning of November, Shanxi Province had newly established more than 15,900 agricultural producers' cooperatives (together with the old cooperatives, the total reached more than 47,700, with member households accounting for 63.4 percent of the province's total households). With the help of the old cooperatives, these new cooperatives quickly formulated production plans and orderly engaged in activities such as autumn plowing, fertilizer accumulation, and basic farmland construction. After the "Four Assessments" work in more than 1,600 new cooperatives in Yanbei Prefecture was completed, they went all out to shift to collective production; and rationally organized labor and livestock, began to formulate various internal management systems for the cooperatives, and carried out autumn plowing, land reclamation, autumn soil collection, finding fertilizer sources, and preparing winter forage for draft animals in a timely manner. After 391 new cooperatives in Gaoping County, Changzhi Prefecture, were put into production, they sowed more than 27,000 mu of wheat in partnership, applying 71 dan of fertilizer per mu. This county also had 377 new cooperatives formulate basic farmland construction plans before the ground froze, planning to change 3,630 small plots into 1,400 large plots, expanding cultivated land by 312 mu. In addition, they will dig canals and wells to expand irrigated land by 5,100 mu.
    More than 31,000 newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives in Guizhou Province are expanding the sowing of winter crops such as wheat and rapeseed in accordance with the national plan. In Duyun Prefecture, the area sown with winter crops by more than 2,900 newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives will account for 40 to 50 percent of the total cultivated land area. Among them, the wheat sowing area will be expanded by more than 25 percent compared with last year, and rapeseed will be expanded by nearly 20 percent. In Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County in the alpine mountainous area, many agricultural producers' cooperatives did not have the habit of planting winter crops in the past, but this year they have begun to try planting. At present, many agricultural producers' cooperatives have completed more than 50 percent of their sowing plans. When sowing winter crops, agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places have generally improved their farming techniques. In Huangping County, strip planting of rapeseed and wheat accounts for more than 60 percent of the total sown area. In Shibing County, most agricultural producers' cooperatives have achieved spot sowing and strip sowing of winter crops, and also applied base fertilizer.
    More than 22,800 agricultural cooperatives established in the autumn in Hunan Province have initially been put on track in terms of operation and management. According to statistics from 8,700 new cooperatives in 33 counties including Hengyang and Xiangtan, 89 percent of production is on the right track, and only 11 percent of production has no plan and has not yet been put on the right track. In counties such as Changde, most new cooperatives have divided districts and groups in labor management and implemented seasonal contracting and small contracting. At present, the local Party committees are helping these new cooperatives to further put into production in an orderly manner. The members of these new cooperatives are very enthusiastic about production. More than 90 percent of the new cooperatives in the Shaoyang area have completed and overfulfilled their current production plans. In Yizhang and Yongxing counties, 154 new cooperatives expanded the autumn sowing area by 56 percent compared with last year. At present, these new cooperatives are working hard to complete the winter sowing plan.
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The agricultural cooperation movement in Jiangsu Province has passed its first wave. More than 111,600 new cooperatives have been established in the province, with a total of more than 147,000 cooperatives, including the old cooperatives, and the number of member households has reached 50 percent of the total number of households in the province. In order to fully turn to rectifying and consolidating the new and old cooperatives, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held the third provincial district committee secretary meeting from October 26 to November 8.
    The meeting discussed the requirements, steps, and methods for concentrating on rectifying and consolidating existing new and old agricultural cooperatives in the next five months, with winter production and spring plowing preparations as the center, and arranged various rural tasks for this winter and next spring.
    The meeting also decided to organize all cadres within the province to conscientiously study the resolutions of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong's report, and to carry out a wide and powerful mass publicity campaign, starting with this meeting. The meeting required all the prefectural, county, and district committee cadres attending the meeting to delve into and personally summarize the experience of rectifying and consolidating a cooperative, set an example, and lead the surrounding cooperatives to carry out rectification. The Provincial Party Committee plans to hold the fourth provincial district committee secretary meeting in late March or early April next year to exchange production and cooperative rectification experiences, and to explain the task of establishing cooperatives before the autumn of next year.

　　山西、贵州、湖南等地
　　新建农业合作社投入生产
　　江苏省委开区委书记会议讨论整社工作
    本报讯山西、贵州、湖南等地新建立的农业合作社，都已有秩序地投入生产。山西省到十一月上旬，已新建立农业生产合作社一万五千九百多个（连同老社已达到四万七千七百多个，入社农户占全省总农户的百分之六十三点四）。这些新社在老社帮助下，都很快地订出了生产计划，有秩序地投入了秋耕、积肥、土地基本建设等活动中。雁北专区一千六百多个新社的“四评”工作结束以后，便全力转入集体生产；并且合理地组织了劳力和畜力，开始订立了社内各种管理制度，适时地进行了秋耕、开荒、秋汇地、寻找肥源、给耕畜准备冬季饲草等活动。长治专区高平县三百九十一个新社投入生产以后，已夥种小麦二万七千多亩，每亩施肥七十一担。这个县并有三百七十七个新社订出地冻前的土地基本建设计划，要变三千六百三十块小块地为一千四百块大地，扩大耕地三百一十二亩。另外，还要开渠打井，扩大水地五千一百亩。
    贵州省新建立的三万一千多个农业生产合作社，正在按照国家计划扩大播种小麦、油菜等冬季作物。都匀专区新建立的二千九百多个农业生产合作社，播种冬季作物的面积将占耕地总面积的百分之四十到五十。其中小麦播种面积将比去年扩大百分之二十五以上，油菜将扩大近百分之二十。在高寒山区的威宁彝族回族苗族自治县内，许多农业生产合作社过去没有种植冬季作物的习惯，今年已开始试种。目前，许多农业生产合作社已完成播种计划百分之五十以上。各地农业生产合作社在播种冬季作物的时候，普遍改进了耕作技术。黄平县条播的油菜和小麦，占整个播种面积百分之六十以上。施秉县大部分农业生产合作社的冬季作物做到点播和条播，还施了底肥。
    湖南省秋季建立的二万二千八百多个农业合作社，在经营管理上已初步走上轨道。据衡阳、湘潭等三十三个县八千七百个新社的统计，生产走上正轨的有百分之八十九，生产尚无计划、还未走上正轨的只有百分之十一。常德等县大部分新社在劳动管理上已划区分组，实行季节包工和小包工。现在，各地党委正在帮助这批新社进一步有秩序地投入生产。这批新社的社员们生产热情很高。邵阳地区百分之九十以上的新社都完成和超额完成了当前的生产计划。宜章、永兴两个县有一百五十四个新社比去年扩大秋种面积百分之五十六。目前，这批新社正在为完成冬种计划而努力。
    本报讯　江苏省农业合作化运动已经度过了第一个浪潮，全省已建成十一万一千六百多个新社，连同老社在内共十四万七千多个社，入社农户达到全省农户总数的百分之五十。中共江苏省委为了全力转入整顿巩固新老社，从十月二十六日到十一月八日，召开了全省第三次区委书记会议。
    会议讨论了今后五个月内以冬季生产和春耕准备工作为中心，全力整顿巩固现有新老农业合作社的要求、步骤和做法，并安排了今冬明春农村的各项工作。
    会议还确定了以这次会议作为开始，在全省范围内组织全体干部认真地学习党的七届六中全会的决议和毛泽东同志的报告，开展一个广泛有力的群众性的宣传工作。会议要求这次到会的全体地、县、区委干部要钻下去，亲自总结一个社的整顿巩固工作的经验，树立榜样，带动周围的社进行整顿。省委准备在明年三月底或四月初召开全省第四次区委书记会议，交流生产、整社经验，并交代明年秋前的建社任务。
