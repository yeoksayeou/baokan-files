    How a Small City Can Do a Good Job in Food Rationing
    Zhao Lan

After the city of Xuchang, Henan Province, implemented the food rationing method, the phenomena of food waste and outflow were eliminated. Even with the large-scale marketing of tobacco and the surge in the mobile population purchasing cooked food, the city's food sales in September were still 28.1% lower than in March. The per capita food supply quotas assessed by the masses throughout the city were all lower than or close to the national average standard. Facts have proved that the national food supply standards are equally in line with the actual consumption level of residents in small cities.

Xuchang is a small city with a population of over 60,000 and is a well-known tobacco market in the country. Its characteristics are: convenient transportation, large mobile population, close ties with rural areas, and a large number of individual laborers. In carrying out food rationing work, the leading organs of Xuchang paid attention to these characteristics.

Most of the employees of industrial and commercial households, workers, and cadres of institutions and enterprises in this city live in nearby rural areas. "Land-attached households" who have land in the countryside account for more than 10% of the city's residents. Because of this situation, a large amount of grain flowed from the city to the countryside this spring. Some residents purchased grain or cooked food on behalf of relatives and friends in the countryside; some even smuggled grain to the countryside for high-priced sales; and some residents housed relatives from the countryside for long periods of time, providing them with meals. All of these caused a large amount of food waste. However, at the beginning of the rationing work, the city residents did not have a correct understanding of the seriousness of this situation. Some people even believed that there was no waste in urban food consumption, and instead of being willing to save food, they demanded an increase in supply.

In order to raise the awareness of the residents, Xuchang City held a food saving exhibition, using the vivid facts of food waste in the city to educate the masses, and mobilized the masses to expose and inspect the phenomenon of food waste. The masses found a large number of waste phenomena such as thrown-away steamed buns, leftover food, and moldy grain, as well as loopholes in the outflow of grain to the countryside. According to preliminary checks by citizens, more than 1,300 households used altered grain purchase certificates to purchase more than 31,000 jin of grain in August, most of which was transported to the countryside. According to the inspection of a residential group in Koujia Alley, among the 15 households in the group, 14 households had guests in April, with a living time of 10 days to a month. A resident of Qingxu Street brought a rich peasant's entire family from the countryside to live in the city. In the week of April 6th to 12th, the Xuchang City Grain Bureau supplied nearly 10,000 jin of grain for "guest use." Using these facts to explain to the masses that this is contrary to the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, it is also detrimental to the worker-peasant alliance, and it is not good for the economic life of urban residents. After such education, the masses deeply realized the truth of "saving is glorious, waste is shameful, and purchasing and trafficking are illegal." In order to promote the work of saving grain among residents and through the introduction of the experience of typical households, exchanging experience in saving grain, some residents dispelled their worries about not having enough grain after the rationing standards were assessed. Many people also made covenants to save grain, guaranteeing to save a certain amount of grain truthfully, and guaranteeing to obey national plans and government laws, not to hoard, purchase, or traffic in grain. After Yang Hongrui, a resident of Jinhua Street, raised his awareness, he also voluntarily told the government about his past hoarding of more than 700 jin of grain.

Xuchang City focused on four tasks in assessing food rationing grades and standards. The first was to find out the population and verify the number of people. In the past, many residents treated the household registration situation as: reporting when they came, not reporting when they left, reporting births, not reporting deaths, reporting marriages, not reporting when they married out. As a result, a lot of grain was purchased in excess and wasted. According to preliminary statistics, there were 545 households in August that fraudulently purchased grain, purchasing more than 16,000 jin of grain. In this population verification, the ideological education of the masses was strengthened, and a combination of self-reporting by the masses, review based on household registration books, and mobilization of the masses for review was adopted to find out the population of general residents in the city. The household registrations of units such as institutions, organizations, and enterprises that falsely reported the number of people and purchased more grain were also rectified, and the number of people purchasing grain in these units was reviewed according to the payroll. The second was to formulate detailed rules for the implementation of the rationing supply method, mobilize the masses to fully discuss, and then revise and implement. Before assessing the residents' rationing standards, the grassroots cadres of the streets were first mobilized and trained, and their families' rationing levels were assessed first, which facilitated gaining experience and promoting the realistic assessment of rationing levels by the masses. The third was to strictly divide the agricultural and semi-agricultural population living in the city. To this end, Xuchang City organized a grain rationing supply working group and a grain "three-determination" working group. The two working groups were unified in leadership and worked simultaneously. Agricultural populations were assessed as surplus grain households, self-sufficient households, and grain-deficient households, and fixed production, fixed purchase, and fixed sales were implemented; for semi-agricultural populations (for example, households with people farming in the suburbs and others working or doing business in the city), the supply quantity was determined separately according to the occupations of the members of the household. Fourth, the city has a very complex variety of individual handicraftsmen, small vendors, and other occupations. In order to do a good job in rationing supply to these people, Xuchang City conducted special research and investigation, dividing them into 58 types of work according to the nature of the industry, and formulating rationing standards based on labor intensity.

In strengthening the management of grain-using industries such as the cooked food industry and the reproduction industry, attention was paid to the principle of both saving grain and ensuring market supply. Xuchang City has 667 cooked food and reproduction businesses, which consumed too much grain in the past due to the loose management and overly generous grain supply. In the first half of this year, the grain supply in this area amounted to more than 4,359,000 jin, an increase of 18.8% over the same period last year. The grain supply for industries such as cooked food and reproduction accounted for 20% of the city's total supply, with an average daily supply of nearly 30,000 jin, which is equivalent to supplying more than 30,000 more people dining in the city every day, more than six times the city's general mobile population. These cooked foods that were sold more than the actual needs were purchased by peddlers through fraudulent means, and some were resold and hoarded by cooked food vendors. Last year, the militia alone seized more than 20,000 jin of cooked food converted into grain that was smuggled to the countryside. Since May and June this year, attention has been paid to the management of grain used by the cooked food industry and the reproduction industry, and the management has been further strengthened when rationing supply was implemented. Now, the grain needed by the cooked food and reproduction industries is planned by the owners, and the Grain Bureau verifies it according to the market needs and the increase or decrease of the mobile population. In addition, three cooperative canteens have been established in the city to supply cooked food in designated areas. Seven cooked food markets have been established in places with a large flow of people, and the vendors who used to set up stalls in back streets and move along the streets have been gradually eliminated. In the past, steamed bun vendors accounted for more than one-third of the cooked food industry, but now some have been reduced, and the supply of cooked foods such as buns, dumplings, and soups has been increased. After such management, the amount of grain used by the cooked food industry has also decreased significantly. The Third Cooperative Canteen used 5,000 jin of flour every day in April, and the supply of cooked food was still in short supply; now that the market has entered the peak season, only more than 500 jin of flour are used, and it can be supplied all day. Xiguan is a tobacco market. The cooked food market here concentrates more than 100 food vendors and only needs about 2,000 jin of flour every day, which can receive about 4,000 people for meals. At present, the cooked food industry in Xuchang City is preparing to implement fixed quality and quantity to further ensure a reasonable supply.

In the past, urban and rural speculators colluded with each other to transport urban grain and create a black market in the countryside. Illegal merchant Ma Fengji colluded with rural peddlers to resell more than 7,300 jin of flour and seek exorbitant profits. In April this year, many speculators used women, children, and peddlers to fraudulently purchase grain in the city. Each steamed bun sold for five cents in the city, and they transferred it to the countryside and sold it at a high price of one jiao and two cents. In the food rationing work, the Xuchang municipal government legally dealt with seven cases of illegal elements fraudulently purchasing grain, and timely exposed the rumors of counter-revolutionary elements, thereby educating the masses and enabling the smooth implementation of food rationing measures.

    一个小城市怎样做好粮食定量供应工作
    赵岚
    河南省许昌市实行了粮食定量供应办法后，消除了粮食浪费和外流现象。在烟叶大量上市、购买熟食品的流动人口骤增的情况下，全市九月份粮食销量仍比三月份减少了百分之二十八点一。经过群众评定的全市人口供应定量，都低于或接近于国家规定的平均标准。事实证明，国家规定的粮食供应标准是同样符合小城市居民的实际消费水平的。
    许昌市是一个六万多人口的小城市，是全国著名的烟草市场。它的特点是：交通便利，流动人口多，同农村的关系密切，个体劳动者多。在进行粮食定量供应工作中，许昌市领导机关是注意了这些特点的。
    这个城市的工商业户的从业人员，机关、企业的工人和干部大多数家居附近农村。在农村中有土地的“寄庄户”就占全市居民户数的百分之十以上。因为有这样的情况，在今年春天，城市的粮食曾大量流入农村。有的居民为农村亲友代购粮食或熟食品；有些人甚至把粮食偷运农村高价出售；有的居民长期收留来自农村的亲属吃饭。这些都造成了粮食的大量浪费。但是，在定量供应工作开始的时候，城市居民们对这种情况的严重性并没有正确的认识。有些人甚至认为城市粮食消费中没有浪费，不但不愿节约粮食，反而要求增加供应量。
    为了提高居民的认识，许昌市曾举行节约粮食展览会，用本市浪费粮食的生动事实教育了群众，并发动群众揭发、检查浪费粮食的现象。群众检查出大量的扔馍、剩饭、霉坏粮食等浪费现象，以及粮食流入农村的漏洞。据市民初步检查，八月份就有一千三百多户用涂改购粮证，套购了粮食三万一千多斤，其中大部粮食被运往农村。据寇家巷一个居民小组检查，全组十五户居民中，在四月间就有十四户留客，居住时间是十天到一月。清虚街一户居民把一户富农全家从农村接来城市居住。四月六日至十二日的一周中，许昌市粮食局就供应“来客用粮”近一万斤。用这些事实向群众说明，这是同粮食统购统销政策相违背的，也是不利于工农联盟的，对城市居民的经济生活也没有好处。经过这样的教育，群众深切地认识到了“节约光荣、浪费可耻、套购贩运违法”的道理。为了推动居民中的节约粮食工作，并且通过典型户的经验介绍，交流节约粮食经验，使部分居民打消了怕定量标准评定后粮食不够吃的顾虑。许多群众并订出了节约粮食的公约，保证实事求是节约一定数量的粮食，保证服从国家计划和政府法令，不囤积、套购、贩运粮食。进化街居民杨鸿瑞提高了觉悟后，把过去囤积七百多斤粮食的事，也自动地向政府说了出来。
    许昌市在评定粮食定量等别和定量标准方面，着重进行了四项工作。首先是查清户口，核实人口。过去许多居民对待户口的情况是：来报走不报，生报死不报，娶报嫁不报，结果，多购和浪费了很多粮食。据初步统计，八月份冒购粮食的就有五百四十五户，多购粮食一万六千多斤。在这次核实人口中，加强了对群众的思想教育，并且采取群众自报、依照户口册复查和发动群众审查相结合的办法，查清了全市一般居民的人口。对虚报人数、多买粮食的机关、团体、企业等单位的户口，也进行了整顿，按照工资册复查了这些单位的购粮人数。第二是制定了定量供应办法的实施细则，发动群众充分讨论，然后修正实行。在评定居民定量标准前，首先发动和训练了街道的基层干部，并且先评定他们家庭的定量等级，这样便于取得经验，推动群众实事求是地评议定量等级。第三是对居住在城市的农业人口和半农业人口，加以严格的划分。为此，许昌市组织了粮食定量供应工作组和粮食“三定”工作组，两个工作组统一领导，同时进行工作。对农业人口评定了余粮户、自足户和缺粮户，实行定产、定购、定销；对半农业人口，（例如，一户中有在郊区种地的人，又有在城内做工或经商的人），按照户内成员职业，分别确定供应数量。第四，市内个体手工业户、小摊贩等职业十分复杂，为了做好对这些人口的定量供应，许昌市曾专门进行了调查研究，依据行业性质划分了五十八个工种，根据劳动强度制定定量标准。
    在加强对熟食业复制业等用粮行业的管理方面，注意了既要节约粮食，又要保证市场供应的原则。许昌市有熟食业、复制业六百六十七户，过去因为粮食供应偏宽，管理松懈，消耗粮食过多。今年上半年这方面的粮食供应量多达四百三十五万九千多斤，比去年同期增加了百分之十八点八。熟食业和复制业等行业的粮食供应量占全市总供应量的百分之二十，平均每天供应近三万斤，等于每天多供应三万多人口在市内就餐，超过许昌市一般流动人口的六倍以上。这些超过实际需要而多销的熟食品，一部分为小贩所套购，一部分为熟食业者所捣卖和囤积。去年，仅民兵就查获偷运往农村的折粮二万来斤的熟食品。从今年五、六月起开始注意了对熟食业和复制业用粮的管理，在实施定量供应的时候，又进一步加强对它们的管理。现在熟食业、复制业所需的粮食，都由业主提出计划，粮食局根据市场需要和流动人口的增减情况核定。此外，全市还成立了三个合作食堂，对熟食品实行划片定点供应。在流动人口来往较多的地方，设立了七个熟食市场，逐步取消过去在背街设摊和沿街流动的摊贩。过去卖馍户占熟食业的三分之一以上，现在减少了一部分，增加包子、饺子和汤类熟食品的供应。经过这样的管理，熟食业的用粮量也显著下降，第三合作食堂，四月份每日使用面粉达五千斤，熟食品仍供不应求；现在市场开始进入旺季，只使用面粉五百多斤，就可做到整日供应。西关是烟草市场，这里的一个熟食市场集中了一百多户饭食挑，每天只需面粉二千来斤，能接待大约四千人吃饭。目前，许昌市熟食业正准备实行定质、定量，进一步保证合理供应。
    从前，城乡投机商人曾互相勾结，倒运城市粮食，在农村制造黑市。不法商人马逢吉勾结农村小贩倒卖面粉七千三百多斤，牟取暴利。今年四月间，许多投机商人利用妇女、儿童、小贩在市内套购，每个蒸馍市内卖五分，他们转运到农村就以一角二分的高价出售。许昌市政府机关在定量供应工作中，依法处理了七起不法分子套购粮食的事件，并及时揭发了反革命分子的谣言，从而教育了群众，使粮食定量供应的措施得以顺利实施。
