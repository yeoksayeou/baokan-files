    Don't Be Fooled by Pretty Advertisements

    In Shanghai, you can see advertisements for "Prince" brand baby cakes everywhere, with pictures of five lively and healthy babies and the words "Essential for babies, nourishing and strengthening." These baby cakes are produced by the Shanghai private Fuchang Chemical Food Factory.

    Many mothers are deceived by this beautiful advertisement. The baby cakes produced by this factory are either spoiled, moldy, or worm-eaten.

    How can baby cakes spoil and become moldy? Just walk into the workshop of the Fuchang Chemical Food Factory that manufactures these baby cakes, and you will see tattered screen doors and windows, allowing flies and insects to pass through unhindered; the granulated sugar used for making the cakes is not covered at all, and is covered with dense flies; the ceiling is not cleaned all year round, and dust mixed with powder falls on the baby cakes; the "cake box cloth" used for steaming the cakes is only washed once every half a month, and it smells terrible. How can clean baby cakes be produced in these places?

    The local health department has criticized the factory more than once. This year, representatives of the National People's Congress also inspected the factory and made suggestions. However, Qian Furu, the profit-seeking capitalist of this factory, turned a deaf ear. According to an investigation on October 27th, the factory still had three hundred dozen spoiled and sour baby cakes. In order to ensure that our country's babies eat clean food, it is hoped that relevant departments will conduct strict inspections of similar food factories and strictly ban their illegal activities.

    不要被漂亮的广告欺骗了
    在上海市到处可以看到“王子牌”乳儿糕的广告画，上面画着五个活泼健壮的婴儿，下面写着“婴儿必备，滋补强身”。这种乳儿糕就是上海私营福昌化学食品工厂的出品。
    很多母亲被这张漂亮的广告画欺骗了。这家工厂出产的乳糕不是变质、发霉，就是虫蛀过的。
    乳糕怎么会变质、发霉的呢？只要走进制造这种乳糕的福昌化学食品工厂的车间，就会看见破烂的纱门纱窗，苍蝇、小虫通行无阻；做糕用的白糖因为没有任何东西遮盖，上面爬满了密密麻麻的苍蝇；天花板终年不打扫，灰尘夹着粉末飘落在乳糕上；蒸糕用的“糕箱布”半个月才洗一次，臭气难闻。在这些地方怎么可能生产出干净的乳糕呢？
    当地卫生部门曾不止一次地向该厂提出批评。今年，全国人民代表大会代表还曾到该厂视察，提出过意见。但是，这个厂的唯利是图的资本家钱福如却置若罔闻。据十月二十七日那天的调查，该厂制造的乳糕还有三百打变质发酸。为了使我国的婴儿吃到清洁的食品，望有关部门对类似这样的食品工厂进行严格的检查，严格取缔他们的不法行为。
