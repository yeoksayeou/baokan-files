　　It is entirely necessary for state-owned enterprises to establish their own affiliated factories (workshops) or repair shops (workshops) in order to reasonably guarantee the completion of production tasks according to the design. The principles for establishing such affiliated factories (workshops) should be: (1) Make as much use as possible of the original local industrial enterprises, or reconstruct or expand the original industrial enterprises, and fully consider the situation of several factories using them jointly; (2) When building new ones, efforts should be made to ensure that several factories of the same nature or an industrial zone share an affiliated factory (workshop). However, according to recent reports from various regions, some state-owned enterprises have not given sufficient consideration to the joint use of an affiliated factory or the full utilization and transformation of existing local industrial enterprises before building or expanding affiliated factories (workshops) or repair shops (workshops). As a result, not only has the state's human, financial, and material resources been wasted, but also many contradictions have arisen between the newly built affiliated factories (workshops) and the existing industrial enterprises, which not only violates the principles of industrial layout but also increases the difficulties in arranging production. In order to prevent the continued occurrence of this situation, the various central departments should strictly implement the following principles when proposing task books and preliminary designs for new or expanded affiliated factories (workshops) or repair shops (workshops) in the future:

　　1. First of all, the production capacity of the original industry in the region should be utilized as much as possible. Even if the conditions are poor but can be improved or upgraded with slight adjustments, or can undertake this task after reorganization and transformation, they should be actively utilized. Some can establish fixed processing orders and technical guidance relationships with them to become their cooperative enterprises, and some can become their affiliated factories. This can save state investment, facilitate the unified arrangement of production in accordance with the policy of overall planning and consideration, and facilitate the socialist transformation of private industry.

　　2. Only when the original industrial base in the region is too poor to be utilized can factories be moved from other places, or new ones built or expanded.

　　3. The scale of affiliated factories (workshops) and repair shops (workshops) that must be newly built or expanded by various enterprises should generally be based on meeting the needs of the enterprise or several enterprises in the region. Avoid blindly undertaking tasks from outside without taking care of the original industrial enterprises, so as not to disrupt or squeeze out the production tasks of the original local enterprises.

　　4. When state-owned enterprises build or expand affiliated factories, in addition to implementing the principle of fully utilizing the original local industrial production capacity, they should also pay special attention to the cooperation between various enterprises in the same region to avoid duplicate construction.

　　5. The repair tasks that state-owned factories need to contract out should be based on local balance, and regional production cooperation should be organized. Only when the region is unable to undertake the task can it be allocated to enterprises in other places by the competent department. This is conducive to the local overall arrangement of production and can reduce unnecessary transportation costs.

　　6. In order to ensure the implementation of the above principles, the local People's Committees have the power to supervise their implementation. In the future, when enterprises under the central departments need to establish affiliated factories (workshops) and repair shops (workshops), they should first seek the opinions of the local People's Committees so as to comprehensively consider whether it is necessary to establish them and what scale is appropriate.

　　7. Existing unresolved problems of this kind in various places can be specifically studied and resolved by the local People's Committees and the relevant units in accordance with the above principles.

　　国务院关于国营企业新建或扩建附属工厂（车间）的时候应充分利用原有地方工业生产能力的指示
　　（一九五五年十一月七日国务院全体会议第二十次会议通过）
    国营企业为了合理地按照设计保证生产任务的完成，建立自己的附属工厂（车间）或修理厂（车间），是完全必要的。建立这样的附属工厂（车间）的原则，应该是：（一）尽量地利用当地原有的工业企业，或对原有工业企业加以改建或扩建，并且充分考虑到几个工厂共同利用的情况；（二）新建时应尽量地做到几个同类性质的工厂或一个工业区共同使用一个附属工厂（车间）。但根据最近各地反映有些国营企业在新建或扩建附属工厂（车间）或修理厂（车间）以前，考虑共同使用一个附属工厂或充分利用和改造本地原有工业企业十分不够，结果，不仅浪费了国家的人力、财力和物力，而且造成了新建附属工厂（车间）和原有工业企业之间的许多矛盾，既违背工业布局的原则，又增加了在安排生产当中的困难。为了防止这种情况的继续发生，中央各部门今后新建或扩建附属工厂（车间）或修理厂（车间）在提出计划任务书和初步设计的时候，即应严格执行下列原则：
    一、首先应尽量利用本地区的原有工业的生产能力。即便是条件较差但稍加整理、提高，或经过改组改造就可担负此项任务的，也应积极加以利用。有的可以与其建立固定的加工订货及技术指导关系，成为自己的协作企业，有的可以变成自己的附属工厂。这样既可节省国家投资，又便于按照统筹兼顾的政策统一安排生产，以及对于私营工业进行社会主义改造。
    二、只有在本地区原有工业基础太差，无法利用的时候，才可由别处迁工厂去，或者新建、扩建。
    三、各企业必须新建或扩建附属工厂（车间）和修理厂（车间）的规模，一般应该以满足本企业或本地区几个企业需要为原则。切忌不照顾原有工业企业，而盲目地向外承揽任务，以致打乱或挤掉地方原有企业的生产任务。
    四、国营企业在新建或扩建附属工厂的时候，除执行充分利用原有地方工业生产能力的原则外，还应该特别注意在同一地区各个企业之间的协作工作，以避免重复建设。
    五、国营各厂需要向外发包的修理任务，应该以地方平衡为主，组织地区性的生产协作，只有在本地区无力承担的情况下，才可以通过主管部门拨给外地企业。这样，既有利于地方统筹安排生产，又可以减少不必要的运输费用。
    六、为了保证上述原则的实施，地方人民委员会负有监督执行之权。今后中央各部门所属企业必须建立附属工厂（车间）和修理厂（车间）的时候，应该先征求当地人民委员会的意见。以便统盘考虑是否需要建立，建立多大规模为宜等问题。
    七、各地现存悬而未决的此类问题，可以按以上原则，由地方人民委员会与各有关单位进行具体研究解决。
                  总理　周恩来
                       一九五五年十一月七日
