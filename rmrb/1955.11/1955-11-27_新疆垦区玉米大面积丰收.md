Large-Scale Bumper Harvest of Corn in Xinjiang Reclamation Area

This year, the Xinjiang Agricultural Production Corps achieved high-yield corn harvests in the Manas River Basin and the Urumqi Reclamation Area. The total area of high-yield land is more than 7,490 mu, with an average yield of 591.57 jin per mu. Among them, 1,376 mu of dent corn in the Wula Usu Farm in the Manas River Basin Reclamation Area yielded an average of 684 jin per mu; 75 mu of corn in the Mengjin Farm in the Urumqi Reclamation Area yielded an average of 1,127 jin per mu. The ability to achieve high-yield corn harvests this year is mainly due to the Corps' emphasis on increasing the production of miscellaneous grain crops and the implementation of advanced cultivation methods such as close planting, furrow irrigation, and artificial pollination. During harvesting, careful harvesting and threshing were carried out to prevent scattering and waste. At present, the Corps has handed over all the harvested corn to the state.

　　新疆垦区玉米大面积丰收
    新疆农业生产部队今年在玛纳斯河流域和乌鲁木齐垦区获得玉米高额丰产。丰产的面积共为七千四百九十多亩，平均每亩产五百九十一点五七斤。其中玛纳斯河流域垦区乌拉乌苏农场一千三百七十六亩的马齿玉米，平均每亩产六百八十四斤；乌鲁木齐垦区猛进农场七十五亩玉米，平均每亩产一千一百二十七斤。今年能够获得玉米的高额丰产，主要是由于部队重视了增产杂粮作物，推行了密植，沟灌及人工授粉等先进的耕作方法。在收割中，细收细打，防止了抛撒浪费。目前部队已将丰收的玉米全部上缴国家。
