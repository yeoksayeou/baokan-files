Xinhua News Agency, Bangalore, November 26th:

　　Friends, brothers!

　　Allow me, on behalf of my friend Nikolai Alexandrovich Bulganin, in my own name, and on behalf of all the friends who have come with us to your great country for this extremely wonderful visit, to express our gratitude for the invitation that made it possible for us to visit Mysore and your extremely beautiful city of Bangalore. (Applause)

　　I also want to thank the Maharaja of Mysore, Jaya Chamaraja Wadiyar Bahadur, Chief Minister Hanumanthaiya, and Mayor of Bangalore, Dinadayalu Naidu, for speaking so kindly about our country and the achievements of the Soviet Union. (Applause)

　　We have been visiting your great country for several days now. Our trip and tour of India is proceeding at such a fast, whirlwind pace that we have lost track of how many days have passed. For example, today Nikolai Alexandrovich and I argued about what day it is, whether it is Saturday or Sunday. (Laughter)

　　In these few days in India, we have seen many things and learned many things. We have gained rich impressions. Today we visited your magnificent city. How many people are on the streets, how many children! How many cheers we have heard expressing the friendship and love of the Indian people for the people of the Soviet Union! (Applause)

　　It would be unseemly of us to think that this friendship and love expressed by the Indian people is given to me and my friend Nikolai Alexandrovich, and the other friends who came along, personally. These feelings express the love and respect of the Indian people for all the peoples of the Soviet Union.

　　What have the people of the Soviet Union done to deserve such high love and such warm gratitude from the great Indian people?

　　I raise this question now because the emergence of our Soviet state, built according to new principles, has been treated very unfavorably, even with hostility, by the capitalist world. But, despite this, as everyone knows, our country has steadily grown and developed.

　　Since the establishment of the Soviet state, we have gone through a long road. The great Lenin and the Communist Party he founded raised the banner of struggle for peace, for building a new society in our country, and now all the peoples have raised this banner. In the early years of the Soviet regime, our country was poor and severely damaged. Industry was severely damaged. Most of the residents were illiterate. Under these circumstances, only Lenin's vision, courage, and wisdom could see the great future of this newborn worker-peasant state, and lead the peoples of our country forward.

　　At that time, our enemies said that the Soviet state would collapse in less than a year, and that the efforts of Lenin and the Bolsheviks would be fruitless.

　　What do you think now? Were these people as astute as prophets? Or were they worse than prophets? (The atmosphere in the hall is lively)

　　You all know that the Soviet state not only did not collapse, but grew into a powerful country with a strong industry and a highly developed economy.

　　Where does the strength of our Soviet state lie? It is because it was born against the opposition of the capitalist world and did not receive any assistance or loans from anyone. On the contrary, some people have tried every possible means to prevent our Soviet people from building the Soviet state. They waged wars and economic blockades against us, and laid all kinds of other obstacles in our path. But despite all this, our country has become stronger year by year, has built various factories and manufacturing plants, has established universities, research institutes, and schools, has improved its cultural level, and has been moving forward.

　　Now, we have to see who has more intellectuals and more engineers: the Soviet Union or any capitalist country.

　　So, where does our strength lie? Our strength lies in the people. The people are the main property. They are the creators of everything that humanity has created.

　　We have learned from our own experience that if the people of your country are illiterate today, they will be literate tomorrow. If a person is illiterate today, tomorrow he will not only be literate, but may also become an engineer or a scientist.

　　As everyone knows, in the early years of the Soviet state, we did not have our own intellectuals. Today, we already have a large army of intellectuals who come from the people, from the working class and the peasants. (Applause) We regard this, friends, as one of our main achievements. (Applause)

　　How do you explain your warm welcome to us, your very friendly hospitality? You know, some people are saying bad things about us. I don't want to engage in propaganda and say the names of those who say bad things about us. You yourselves have already seen in the newspapers what some representatives of the bourgeois press have said about our trip to India. But you won't believe these words. You don't believe these words because you know that these dirty words are all slanders. (Applause)

　　We want to say to these hired writers: write whatever you like, say whatever you like—slander cannot destroy a good reputation. (The whole hall is lively) We quote a Russian proverb: a man is walking, dogs bark at him, the wind blows at him, but the man still walks his path as usual. (Laughter)

　　We are also walking our path, a path that humanity has never walked before: the road of socialist construction. Our country is paving a road to a bright future for all mankind.

　　Our people are building a communist society, and they will do it, they will build a communist society.

　　You may have different views on our ideology. We may have different understandings of some issues. You are free to choose the path of development you like best. We not only do not hinder you, but will also help you in your good work aimed at developing your country and seeking happiness for your noble and great people. (Applause)

　　We say: some of our experiences may be useful to you. If so, use this experience. If it does not suit you, do not use it. We do not force anyone to accept anything, we do not force anyone to assume any political obligations.

　　Why do we explain this so frankly? Because we treat you as sincerely as brothers. (Applause)

　　Your welcome to us is a special welcome, and we understand this. We have been to many cities and villages in India, and we have seen many things. Today's India is like a surging torrent that breaks through obstacles along the way and rushes forward. This torrent makes the old world tremble. But we welcome and are encouraged by the Indian people's liberation from colonial slavery and India's embarkation on the road of independent development. (Applause)

　　Why do we view India this way, and why do some other countries not want India to develop independently? Because we do not intend to take advantage of your industrial weakness, while some other countries want to use it to enrich their own pockets.

　　We hope that you will build your factories and manufacturing plants as soon as possible. We saw a very good research institute today. But you yourselves will see later that this is a very small research institute, this is just a beginning.

　　We sincerely hope that India can be as great and powerful economically as it is today spiritually, culturally, and morally. We hope that it has a highly developed industry, a developed agriculture, and a high standard of living for its people. On our part, we are willing to help you in this wonderful and remarkable cause. (Applause)

　　The mayor spoke very well here when he talked about the Five Principles. These Five Principles were originally announced in the joint statement signed by Mr. Nehru and our great friend Zhou Enlai. (Applause) These principles were reiterated in the Soviet-Indian statement signed in Moscow during Jawaharlal Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union. Our relations with your country are based on this document.

　　I just said that in some things—in methods and theories—we are different from you. We do not hide this, and you do not hide this. But this does not prevent us from being friends. Why? Because neither you nor we have any bad intentions towards each other. You are truly our sincere friends, and we are also your best friends and brothers. (Applause) This is a clear example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems.

　　We suggest to all countries: let us live in friendship, let us not quarrel and scold each other in newspapers and speeches. At the same time, we also frankly say that we do not like the capitalist method of managing the economy, just as not all countries like our method.

　　We are willing to say to the leaders of capitalist countries, let us prove in practice which system is better. Let us engage in competition without war. (Applause) Is this a bad suggestion? This is better than saying let us compete in who manufactures more weapons, who will defeat whom. That is an inhumane competition, a competition to destroy people. Our suggestion advocates a peaceful competition to improve the living standards of the people of all countries. We have always advocated and will always advocate such a competition, which can help to raise the welfare of the people to a higher level. Therefore, our suggestions are very clear and easy to understand. These suggestions are understandable to everyone. I am convinced that this clear and fair attitude of the Soviet Union is welcomed by the Indian people. But we must look at things soberly and estimate the situation correctly. As everyone knows, every beast has its own food. For example, tigers eat meat and buffaloes eat grass. You cannot force buffaloes to eat meat; nor can you force tigers to eat grass. (The whole hall is lively) I will not elaborate further, lest I be suspected of engaging in propaganda. I believe my idea is very clear to you. (Applause, the whole hall is lively)

　　Friends, we have put forward very clear proposals on the issue of disarmament. The mayor has mentioned here that we have reduced our armed forces by 640,000 people. We have dismantled our base on the Porkkala Peninsula in Finland and abandoned our naval base in Lushunkou.

　　The Soviet Union has proposed banning atomic and hydrogen weapons and has put forward proposals on reducing conventional armaments. We have proposed establishing effective supervision. But others tell us that we cannot discuss disarmament with you unless you agree to a kind of supervision that allows the United States and the Soviet Union to inspect each other's territory from the air.

　　The matter itself is clear, such supervision is unacceptable because it does not solve the problem. Let us imagine that American planes start flying over the Soviet Union, and Soviet planes start flying over the United States, what good is it? The plane is flying, the pilot sees: here is a city, there is a village, here are troops stationed, there are some factories. For example, imagine we see that the Americans have a large number of airports, that is to say, we will come to the conclusion that we need to catch up, so as not to fall behind, and we need to build some airports. (The whole hall is lively)

　　The Americans will see everything we have and will say that they must have more airports, planes, and maybe something else.

　　It can be seen that if we accept this proposal, it will only lead to an arms race. We say to the politicians of Western countries: if you are afraid of disarmament and destroying your bomb reserves, then let us make a gentlemen's agreement: that we will all never use atomic weapons. They reply that they cannot make such a guarantee because hydrogen bombs and atomic bombs are needed to maintain "equilibrium." What does this "equilibrium" mean? This means an arms race, means diverting a large amount of wealth and a large part of the people's labor not to the peaceful development of the country, but to military purposes. When Western countries are unwilling to reduce armaments, can we unilaterally further reduce armaments? I want to answer this question with a Russian proverb: When living with wolves, one must howl like a wolf. (The whole hall is lively)

　　Since Western countries do not intend to ban the production of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and do not even intend to promise not to use such weapons, we have to manufacture atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, rocket weapons, and all other destructive weapons as well.

　　Today, newspapers in many countries, including some Indian newspapers, have published news about the Soviet Union exploding an atomic bomb. I cannot say that this explosion did not happen. (The whole hall is lively, laughter) This explosion did indeed happen. This was the most powerful explosion. Tomorrow our newspaper will publish relevant news about this matter.

　　Recently, according to the plan for scientific research and experimental work in the field of atomic energy, our country has tested new types of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen weapons). This test fully confirmed the correctness of the corresponding scientific and technical calculations and showed the important new achievements of Soviet scientists and engineers. The recent test explosion of a hydrogen bomb was the most powerful explosion that had been carried out until recently. Our scientists and engineers have been able to use relatively small amounts of nuclear material to create explosions with a power equivalent to millions of tons of ordinary explosives. But I want to declare, friends, that the Soviet Union will never abuse this weapon. (Applause, the atmosphere in the hall is lively) We will be happy if these bombs never explode in cities or villages. (Applause) Let these bombs stay there and affect the nerves of those who want to start a war. Let these people know that war cannot be started, because if war is started, they will get their due reward. (The atmosphere in the hall is lively)

　　We are forced to study this terrible weapon. This matter does not encourage us. We are enthusiastically researching how to produce more machines, tractors, plows, how to plant more wheat, rice, and cotton, and how to supply residents with enough meat, vegetables, fish, and other foods. This is what we hope for, this is what we are working hard to do. (Applause)

　　For this purpose, we will continue to resolutely fight for world peace in the future. (Applause) We will continue to fight for easing international tensions in the future. (Applause) We will strive to eliminate the "Cold War" and are committed to the development of international trade.

　　We will care for the development of friendly contacts between the people of all countries. This is the requirement of life. This is the need of humanity.

　　We will do our best to meet the needs of humanity. We cannot slacken our efforts, we must mobilize all necessary forces to force those with aggressive tendencies in some countries to talk less about war and more about contact, more about developing peaceful relations between countries, and eliminating international tensions.

　　If I have said something that makes someone unhappy, then please forgive me. (The whole hall is lively, applause) I mainly want to express warm and friendly feelings to your great people, and to tell you all the Soviet people's most friendly feelings towards the Indian people. (Prolonged applause)

　　Finally, let me once again express our deep gratitude to the outstanding figure, outstanding politician, and Prime Minister of India, Mr. Nehru, who invited our delegation to visit your great and hospitable country. (Applause)

　　Long live the fraternal friendship between the Indian people and the Soviet people.

　　Hindi-Rusi bhai bhai! (Indians and Russians are brothers). (Prolonged applause)

专栏：

　　十一月二十六日在班加罗尔的一次集会上
　　赫鲁晓夫的演说
    朋友们，兄弟们！
    请容许我代表我的朋友尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·布尔加宁，以我自己的名义，并且代表同我们一起到你们这个伟大的国家来作这次极其美好的访问的全体朋友们，对于使我们有可能访问你们的卖索尔邦以及你们的极其美好的城市班加罗尔的邀请，表示感谢。（掌声）
    我也要感谢这样友善地讲到我们的国家和苏联的成就的卖索尔邦邦长贾雅·钱马拉雅·瓦迪雅·巴哈杜尔先生，首席部长哈努曼塔亚先生和班加罗尔市长迪那达雅尔·奈都先生表示感谢。（掌声）
    我们在你们这个伟大的国家内进行访问现在已经有好几天了。我们在印度的旅行和参观以那么一种极快的、疾风骤雨一般的速度进行，以致我们不知道已经过了多少天了。举一个例子说，今天我们就同尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇争辩今天是什么日子，是星期六呢还是星期日。（笑声）
    在印度的这几天内，我们已经看过了许多东西，同时也学到了许多东西。我们已经获得了丰富的印象。今天我们访问了你们这个光辉的城市。到街上来的人是多么多，儿童是多么多啊！我们听到了多么多表达印度人民对苏联各族人民的友谊和热爱的欢呼声啊！（掌声）
    如果我们认为印度人民所表示的这种友谊和热爱是给予我和我的朋友尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇以及同我们一起来的其他朋友个人的，那我们是太不体面了。这些感情所表达的是印度人民对苏联各族人民的热爱和尊敬。
    苏联各族人民做了些什么事情值得伟大的印度人民的这样高度的热爱和这样热烈的感谢呢？
    我现在所以提出这个问题，是因为按照新的方针建立起来的我们的苏维埃国家的出现，受到了资本主义世界非常不友好的、甚至是敌视的对待。但是，尽管这样，大家知道，我们的国家还是稳步地成长和发展起来。
    自从苏维埃国家建立以后，我们经历了很长的道路。伟大的列宁和他所创建的共产党高举起为争取和平、为在我们国家建立一个新社会而斗争的旗帜，而现在各族人民都举起了这个旗帜。在苏维埃政权的最初年代里，我们的国家是贫困的、并且遭到严重的破坏。工业破坏得很厉害。大部分居民都不识字。在这种情况下，只有列宁的远见、勇气和智慧，才能看到这个新生的工农国家的伟大前途，并且领导我国各族人民前进。
    当时我们的敌人说，不到一年，苏维埃国家就会垮台，列宁和布尔什维克的努力将毫无结果。
    你们现在怎么想呢？这些人像先知一样高明呢？还是他们比先知差一些呢？（会场空气活跃）
    你们大家都知道，苏维埃国家不但没有垮台，而且成长为一个拥有强大的工业和高度发展的经济的强大国家了。
    我们苏维埃国家的力量在那里呢？因为它是在资本主义世界的反对下诞生的，并且没有从任何人那里得到任何援助或贷款。相反的，有人曾经千方百计想要阻挠我们苏联人民建设苏维埃国家。他们对我们进行了战争和经济封锁，在我们的道路上布下了其他各种各样的障碍。但是尽管有这一切，我们的国家还是一年比一年强盛，还是建造了各种工厂和制造厂，设立了大学、研究所和学校，提高了自己的文化水平，并且一直在向前进。
    现在，我们可要看看到底谁有更多的知识分子、更多的工程师：是苏联呢还是任何资本主义国家。
    那末，我们的力量到底在那里呢？我们的力量在于人民。人民是主要的财产。他们是人类所创造的一切东西的制造者。
    我们根据自己的经验了解到，如果解放了自己国家的人民今天是不识字的话，那末他们明天就会是识字的。如果一个人今天是不识字的话，明天他不仅将会识字，而且还可能成为工程师，成为科学家。
    大家知道，在苏维埃国家的最初年代里，我们没有自己的知识分子。今天，我们已经有了一支从人民中来的，从工人阶级和农民中来的知识分子的大军。（掌声）我们把这一点，朋友们，看作我们的主要成就之一。（掌声）
    对于你们对我们的热烈欢迎，你们对我们的非常友好的款待怎样解释呢？你们知道，有些人在讲我们的坏话。我不愿进行宣传，说出那些讲我们坏话的人的名字。你们自己在报纸上已经看到了资产阶级报纸的某些代表对我们这次印度之行说了些什么。但是你们不会相信这些话的。你们所以不相信这些话是因为你们知道他们所说的这些肮脏话都是诽谤。（鼓掌）
    我们要对这些御用文人说：你们高兴写什么就写什么吧，你们高兴说什么就说什么吧——诽谤是破坏不了好名声的。（全场活跃）我们引用一句俄国俗语：一个人在走路，狗对他叫，风对他吹，但是这个人还是照常走他的路。（笑声）
    我们也在走我们的路，这是人类从来没有走过的路：社会主义建设的道路。我们的国家正在为全人类铺平一条通往美好的未来的道路。
    我国人民正在建设共产主义社会，他们将做到这一点，他们将建成共产主义社会。
    你们可能对我们的思想意识有不同的看法。我们彼此之间可能对一些问题有不同的了解。你们尽可以选择你们最喜欢的发展道路。我们不仅不妨碍你们，并且还将帮助你们进行你们的以发展你们的国家、为你们高尚伟大的人民谋求幸福的目的的良好工作。（掌声）
    我们说：我们的经验中有一些可能对你们是有益处的。如果是这样的话，就利用这种经验吧。如果它不适合你们，就不要利用它。我们不强迫人家接受任何事情，我们不强制人家承担任何政治义务。
    我们为什么这样坦率地说明这一点呢？因为我们像兄弟般诚恳地对待你们。（掌声）
    你们对我们的欢迎是特殊的欢迎，我们了解到这一点。我们到过了印度的许多城市和乡村，而且看到了许多东西。今天的印度像一股沿路冲破障碍奔向前方的汹涌澎湃的洪流。这股洪流使旧世界发抖。但是我们却对印度人民挣脱殖民奴役和印度走上独立发展的道路感到欢迎鼓舞。（掌声）
    为什么我们这样看待印度，并且为什么某些其他国家不希望印度独立发展呢？因为我们不打算利用你们工业的薄弱，而某些其他国家却希望靠它来肥自己的私囊。
    我们希望你们尽快建立你们的工厂和制造厂。我们今天看到了一个很好的研究所。但是你们自己以后将会看到，这是一个很小的研究所，这仅仅是一个开端。
    我们真诚地希望印度能在经济上也同它今天在精神上、文化上和道义上同样伟大和强大的国家。我们希望它有高度发展的工业，发达的农业和人民的高度生活水平。在我们方面，我们愿意在这个美好和了不起的事业中帮助你们。（掌声）
    市长先生在这里谈到五项原则的时候讲得很好。这五项原则原先是在尼赫鲁先生和我们伟大的朋友周恩来签署的联合声明中宣布的。（掌声）在贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁先生访问苏联期间在莫斯科签署的苏印声明中重申了这些原则。我们同你们国家的关系就是以这个文件为基础的。
    我刚才说过，在有些事情上——在方法和理论方面——我们同你们是有不同的。我们并不掩饰这一点，你们也不掩饰这一点。但是这并不妨碍我们交朋友。为什么？因为你们和我们都不对彼此有任何坏念头。你们真正是我们的真诚的朋友，我们也是你们的最好的朋友和兄弟。（鼓掌）这是具有不同社会制度的国家之间的和平共处的一个明显的例子。
    我们向一切国家建议：让我们友好相处，不要在报纸和演说中进行争吵和谩骂吧。同时我们也坦白地说，我们不喜欢资本主义的管理经济的方法，正好像不是所有国家都喜欢我们的方法一样。
    我们愿意向资本主义国家的领袖们说，让我们用实践来证明哪一种制度更好。让我们进行不打仗的竞争。（掌声）难道这是一个不好的建议吗？这比说让我们比赛谁的武器制造得多、谁将打倒谁要好些。那是一种不人道的竞赛，是一种毁灭人的竞赛。我们的建议主张为提高所有国家人民的生活水平而进行和平的竞赛。我们一向主张而且将始终主张进行这样一种竞赛，这种竞赛可以帮助把人民的福利提到更高的水平。因此我们的建议是非常清楚而且容易了解的。这些建议是人人都能了解的。我深信苏联的这种明确而公正的态度是为印度人民所欢迎的。但是我们必须清醒地看待事物和正确地估计情势。大家知道，每一种野兽有它自己的食物。例如，老虎是吃肉的，水牛是吃草的。你不能强使水牛吃肉；也不能强使老虎吃草。（全场活跃）我不再详细阐释，以免有进行宣传的嫌疑。我相信我的想法对你们是很清楚的。（掌声、全场活跃）
    朋友们，我们已经就裁军问题提出了非常清楚的建议。市长先生已经在这里提到过我们已经把武装部队裁减了六十四万人。我们已经拆除了我们在芬兰波卡拉半岛上的基地并且放弃了我们在旅顺口的海军基地。
    苏联已经建议禁止原子武器和氢武器，并提出了关于裁减常规军备的建议。我们已经建议建立有效的监督。但是别人告诉我们说：非要等到你们同意一种使美国和苏联能够彼此从空中视察对方领土的监督的时候，我们才能同你们讨论裁军问题。
    事情本身很清楚，这样的监督是不能接受的，因为它并不解决问题。让我们想像，美国飞机开始在苏联上空飞行，苏联飞机开始在美国上空飞行，这有什么好处呢？飞机在飞，飞行员看到：这里是城市，那边是村庄，这里驻扎着军队，那边是一些工厂。例如，想像我们看到了美国人有大量的飞机场，那就是说，我们会作出这样的结论：我们需要赶上去，可别落后，还要建筑一些飞机场。（全场活跃）
    美国人那方面将看到我们所有的东西，也会说，他们必须有更多的飞机场、飞机，可能还有其他什么东西。
    可见，如果我们接受了这种建议，那只是导致军备竞赛。我们对西方国家的政治家说：如果你们害怕裁军和销毁你们的炸弹储备，那末让我们作出君子保证：我们大家永远不使用原子武器。他们回答说，他们不能作这样的保证，因为需要用氢弹和原子弹来维持“均势”。这种“均势”意味着什么呢？这就意味着军备竞赛，意味着把大量资财和很大部分的人民劳动不用于国家的和平发展，而用于军事目的。当西方国家不愿意裁减军备的时候，我们能不能单方面进一步裁减军备呢？我要用这样一句俄罗斯的谚语来回答这个问题：同狼在一起生活，就得要像狼那样嗥叫。（全场活跃）
    由于西方国家不打算禁止原子武器和氢武器的生产，甚至不打算答应不使用这种武器，我们就不得不也制造原子弹和氢弹、火箭武器和一切其他毁灭性的武器了。
    今天许多国家的报纸，包括一些印度的报纸刊载了苏联爆炸原子弹的新闻。我不能说，这个爆炸是没有的。（全场活跃、笑声）这个爆炸的的确确是有过。这是威力最猛烈的一次爆炸。明天我们的报纸就会就这件事发表有关的新闻。
    最近，根据原子能方面的科学研究和实验工作计划，我们国家试验了新型的原子武器和热核子武器（氢武器）。这次试验充分证实了相应的科学和技术计算的正确，表明了苏联科学家和工程师的重要新成就。最近一次氢弹的试验爆炸，是直到最近为止曾经进行过的爆炸中最猛烈的一次。我们的科学家和工程师已经能够利用相对地少量的核子物质来造成威力相当于几百万吨普通爆炸物的爆炸。但是我要声明，朋友们，苏联决不会滥用这种武器。
  （掌声，会场空气活跃）如果这些炸弹永远不在城市或乡村爆炸，我们将感到幸福愉快。（掌声）让这些炸弹搁在那里，让它们去影响那些想发动战争的人的神经吧。让这些人知道，战争是不能发动的，因为如果发动战争，就会得到应得的报答。（会场空气活跃）
    我们是被迫研究这种可怕武器的。这件事情并不是令我们鼓舞的。我们兴致勃勃地在研究如何更多地生产各种机器、拖拉机、犁，如何更多地种植小麦、大米、棉花，如何供应居民足够的肉、蔬菜、鱼和其他食品。这就是我们所希望的，这就是我们努力做的工作。（掌声）
    为了这个目的，我们今后将继续坚决地为争取世界和平而斗争。（掌声）我们今后将继续为争取缓和国际紧张局势而斗争。（掌声）我们要努力争取消除“冷战”，致力于发展国际贸易。
    我们将关怀各国人民之间友好接触的发展。这是生活的要求。这是人类的需要。
    我们将竭尽全力满足人类的需要。我们不能松劲，必须动员一切必要的力量，以迫使某些国家中有侵略情绪的人物少谈战争，多谈接触，多谈发展国与国之间的和平关系和消除国际紧张局势。
    如果我说了些使什么人不愉快的话，那末请原谅我。（全场活跃、掌声）我主要是想向你们伟大的人民表示热烈友好的感情，告诉你们全体苏联人民对印度人民的最友好的感情。（经久不息的掌声）
    最后，让我向邀请我们代表团前来访问你们伟大的好客国家的卓越人物、杰出的政治家、印度总理尼赫鲁先生再次表示我们深刻的感谢。（掌声）
    印度人民和苏联人民之间的兄弟友谊万岁。
    印地露西巴伊巴伊！（印度人和俄国人是兄弟）。（经久不息的掌声）
