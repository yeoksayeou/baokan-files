    Abundant Fish Harvest at Dongshan Fishing Ground
    The Dongshan Fishing Ground in Dongshan County, on the frontline of coastal defense in Fujian Province, has seen successive bumper harvests in its spring and summer fishing seasons this year. A total of more than 231,000 dan of fish were caught, an increase of 11.3 percent compared to the same period last year.
    Dongshan Fishing Ground is a well-known fishing area in Fujian Province, with a marine fishing ground area of 893 square kilometers, rich in various kinds of fish. This year, under the protection of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense troops and the leadership of the local Party committee, fishermen have developed mutual aid and cooperation, improved fishing techniques, and actively gone to sea to fish. This has resulted in the highest fish production since liberation. Currently, fishermen are actively preparing for the winter fishing season, in order to greet the upsurge of fishery cooperation with even greater catches. (Lin Huimin)

    东山渔场鱼产丰收
    福建省海防前线东山县的东山渔场今年春夏汛接连丰收。共捕鱼二十三万一千多担，比去年同期增产百分之十一点三。
    东山渔场是福建省的著名渔区，海洋渔场面积有八百九十三平方公里，盛产各种鱼类。今年渔民在解放军海防部队保卫和当地党委的领导下，发展互助合作，改进捕鱼技术，积极下海捕鱼。使鱼产量得到了解放以来的最高记录。目前渔民们已在积极作好冬汛出海准备，以更多的捕鱼量来迎接渔业合作化高潮的到来。　　（林惠民）
