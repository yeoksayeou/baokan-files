Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, November 27th: The government of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement on November 26th.

The statement said that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference clearly showed that guaranteeing peace is the main issue for the people of Europe. The German people demand that the peaceful cooperation of European countries be guaranteed by establishing a collective security system and abolishing all existing military blocs. This also creates external conditions for the peaceful and democratic reunification of Germany.

The Geneva Conference showed that the reunification of Germany is only possible as a peaceful and democratic country. The Geneva Conference once again proved that the German question cannot be resolved as long as the cause of German reunification is not in the hands of the Germans themselves.

The statement pointed out: At present, there are two independent German states with different social systems and different development directions. Therefore, only by bringing the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany closer together and establishing cooperation between them is it the only way to reunify Germany into a peace-loving country. To this end, the government of the German Democratic Republic has proposed the establishment of an all-German committee, the work of which would help create external and internal conditions for the restoration of German unity. This proposal has been supported by broad sections of the German people, but the Western countries and the Bonn government have rejected this proposal, and they oppose the restoration of German unity.

The statement pointed out that the proposals put forward by the three Western powers are to remilitarize Germany and make the whole of Germany participate in the aggressive bloc of Western countries. Their proposal to hold all-German elections next year is also pursuing this goal. It is quite clear that under the current circumstances, the elections do not yet have the necessary prerequisites. If this proposal is implemented, it will turn the whole of Germany into an imperialist and militarist country, and it will deepen the danger of a new world war in Europe. The German people will never agree to this.

The statement condemned the Bonn government for accelerating the remilitarization of West Germany after the Geneva Conference, thereby turning West Germany into a breeding ground for unrest and conflict in Western Europe, and at the same time trapping Germany in long-term division. The statement called on West Germany to implement a policy of ending the "Cold War" and stopping remilitarization, break away from US supervision, and instead adopt a German policy that is beneficial to the German people, thereby contributing to creating the necessary conditions for a peaceful solution to the German question.

The statement finally reiterated that the government of the German Democratic Republic is prepared to make the necessary efforts together with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany to establish an all-German committee.

### 民主德国政府就四外长会议结果发表声明

　　民主德国政府就四外长会议结果发表声明
    新华社柏林二十七日电　德意志民主共和国政府在十一月二十六日发表了一项声明。
    声明说，四国外交部长会议清楚表明，保障和平是欧洲各国人民的主要问题。德国人民要求通过建立集体安全体系和取消一切现有的军事集团来保障欧洲各国人民的和平合作。这同时也就是为和平和民主地重新统一德国创造外部条件。
    日内瓦会议表明，德国的统一只有作为一个和平和民主的国家才有可能实现。日内瓦会议再度证明，只要重新统一德国的事业不掌握在德国人自己的手里，德国问题就不可能解决。
    声明指出：目前德国存在着两个社会制度不同、发展方向不同的独立国家。因此，只有使德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国接近，并且在它们之间建立合作，才是使德国统一成为爱好和平的国家的唯一道路。为此，德意志民主共和国政府曾经建议成立全德委员会，这个委员会的工作会有助于为恢复德国的统一创造外部和内部条件。这个建议得到德国人民广大人士的支持，但是，西方国家和波恩政府拒绝了这项建议，它们反对恢复德国的统一。
    声明指出西方三国提出的建议是要使德国重新军国主义化，使整个德国参加西方国家的侵略集团。它们提出的在明年举行全德选举的建议也是追求这个目的。十分明显，在目前情况下，选举还没有具备必要的前提。如果实施这个建议，就会使整个德国变成帝国主义和军国主义的国家，就会使欧洲发生新的世界大战的危险加深。德国人民绝不同意这样做。
    声明谴责波恩政府在日内瓦会议后反而加速西德重新军国主义化，从而使西德变为西欧的不安和冲突的温床，同时使德国长期陷于分裂。声明要求西德实行结束“冷战”和停止重新军国主义化的政策，摆脱美国的监督，转而采取有利于德国人民的德国的政策，从而为创造和平解决德国问题的必要条件作出贡献。
    声明最后重申德意志民主共和国政府准备同德意志联邦共和国政府共同作出必要的努力来建立全德委员会。
