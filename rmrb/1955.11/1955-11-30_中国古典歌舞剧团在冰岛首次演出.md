Xinhua News Agency, Reykjavik, November 29th: The Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Theater gave its first performance in Iceland on the evening of November 26 at the Icelandic National Theater in Reykjavik.

Those who attended the performance included: President of the Republic of Iceland, Ásgeir Ásgeirsson, Speaker of the Icelandic Parliament, Brynleifur Björnsson, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guðmundur Í. Guðmundsson, Minister of Finance, Rögnvaldur Pétursson, Minister of Education, Benedikt Gröndal, as well as leaders of various Icelandic political parties, many famous figures in Icelandic culture and arts, and diplomatic envoys from many countries to Iceland.

After the performance, the director of the Icelandic National Theater, Rossing Kranz, held a reception to welcome all members of the theater troupe. More than one hundred people attended the reception, including the Icelandic Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Finance, Minister of Education, Icelandic literary and art figures, and diplomatic envoys from various countries.

Rossing Kranz spoke at the reception, highly praising the traditional Chinese drama.

He then said: "Some say that the East and the West can never meet. But, dear friends, haven't you negated this statement with your visit to this remote Western country? Therefore, we can say that under the banner of beautiful art, freedom, and friendship, the East and the West are now meeting here in Iceland."

Chu Tunan, head of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Theater, then spoke, expressing his belief that the troupe's visit would surely enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Icelandic people, and promote cultural exchanges between the two countries.

On the evening of November 27, Icelandic President Ásgeir Ásgeirsson received Chu Tunan. Prior to this, Chu Tunan had also met separately with the Speaker of the Icelandic Parliament, Brynleifur Björnsson, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Guðmundur Í. Guðmundsson, and Minister of Education, Benedikt Gröndal. During the meetings, they all welcomed the visit of the Chinese Classical Opera and Dance Theater to Iceland.
