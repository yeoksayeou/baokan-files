    Screenplay by K. Abbas U.B. Sathye Directed by Raj Kapoor
    Produced by India's Raj Kapoor Films Co. Dubbed and Replicated by Changchun Film Studio

    Tens of thousands of Chinese people care about a vagabond in India. The high Himalayas cannot separate the mutual concern of the people. Raj shed sweat, tears, and blood for his mother, his lover, and his own right to live. He made an outcry for the insulted and injured people of India during a period. He touched us. Through him, through the whole story, we feel closer to the Indian people. We understand why they laugh, why they cry, why they are angry; we understand how clever and capable they are, and how tenacious they are.

    It is imaginable that this strong infectiousness of the film made the people engaged in dubbing work invest all their hearts and all their feelings. The profound and inspiring performances of these Chinese artists have turned such a complex foreign film into something loved by the Chinese people.

    The Indian film "The Vagabond" is a strong protest against social injustice: its complex and tortuous story reveals the inseparable relationship between human destiny and social conditions, and runs through the spirit of advocating justice and humanity. Raj, who should have been born into a wealthy family, was driven to the slums with his mother, Leela, while still in her womb, due to the hypocrisy and cowardice of his father, Judge Raghunath. He couldn't support his mother, he couldn't go to school, and he couldn't find a job. The people he could approach were those who were as insulted and injured as he was, those who retaliated against social injustice in order to affirm their existence and survive, like the robbers like Zaka. In this way, Raj became a thief and a robber, a prisoner and a vagabond. In the middle, he met his childhood sweetheart, Rita, and they fell in love. For this reason, he decided to give up his life as a thief and go to work in a factory. However, the factory kicked him out because he had been a thief. Raj, who could neither work nor was willing to be a thief again, went through many twists and turns and finally embarked on the final road of despair, becoming a murderer for his mother and his lover. Only after he became a murderer, in court, did he get the only chance in his life to make an outcry for the unjust people and make a powerful appeal for justice and humanity. This is a strong satire on society.

    Due to the complexity and tortuousness of the story and the dramatic nature of the performance, and due to the beauty and moving nature of the music and dance, the film is attractive. However, what deeply captures people's hearts is the fate of people under the two strongly opposed forces of Raghunath and Zaka. Judge Raghunath is in a position to make people die or live, believing that the son of a good person must be a good person, and the son of a bad person must be a bad person. It is not surprising that he says this is his belief. This is exactly what is produced on a certain social basis. Raghunath performs his duties according to this belief (in fact, prejudice), and he resolutely wants to implement his belief. The robber Zaka was harmed by this belief, so he also resolutely and stubbornly wanted to shatter this belief. This sharp tit-for-tat struggle made the judge's son a scapegoat for his father's sins, and at the same time made the judge subject to the judgment of his own beliefs and social justice. Here, the screenwriter, director, and actors are all remarkably successful.

    As a realistic work, the film "The Vagabond" has a noble style. Obviously, a belief completely opposite to Raghunath's belief prompted the collaborators of the entire film to emphasize the real demands of the working people. The people oppose theft and robbery, oppose murder and arson, and they demand to use their own labor to create their own respected lives. This is something that is contrary to Raghunath's belief. To work and to be a good person, this is Raj's wish and call that will never be extinguished from childhood to adulthood. There is no need to say more about shining shoes, asking Zaka to introduce him to work, and entering the factory. Raj, who had been a robber for twelve years, still could not forget the reason why he became a prisoner in prison. He held a piece of cake and said, "There is no such thing in my house! If my family had this little thing in the first place, I would not have suffered such an unfortunate fate. It was because of this piece of bread that I was sent here for the first time twelve years ago." The fate of not being able to create one's own life through one's own labor and being forced to become a robber makes Raj's heart often bleed. When he first met Rita, he couldn't help but tell her the truth; he was about to point out: "Some people do bad things all the time, just because they are rich and wear beautiful clothes, people respect them and call them gentlemen. Those honest poor people, who work hard every day, are often hungry because they can't afford to wear beautiful clothes. People say they are thieves, vagabonds, and criminals, and even send them to prison. So, the rich are the real thieves, just like me!" It was precisely because the deep contradiction between wish and reality pierced his heart that, although he deeply loved Rita, he would forget himself and brutally beat Rita when Rita called him a "savage."

    The strong human desire, despite being subjected to the ruthless pressure of stubborn reality, never bows its head. Zaka is a typical example of a blind rebel. He and Raj also have the desire to be an honest worker and a good person. It was precisely because this desire was destroyed that he held an irreconcilable hatred for Raghunath, who destroyed his desire and life. In order to retaliate, in order to shatter the belief that destroyed his desire, because the road to becoming an honest worker had been closed to him, he went straight to the road of becoming a robber and inducing Raj to become a robber, and never looked back. However, does Zaka have no contradictions? Why doesn't he dare to affirm that he and Raj are good people? Why does he satirize Raj, "You still think you are a good person..."? He cannot say that his road is good. However, he affirms that he and Raj only have a bad road to take. He said: "No matter who it is, as long as he gets on this road, he will never want to turn back!" What a painful mood there is here! What a terrifying revelation and protest this is. As a person who insists on resisting but cannot identify his own path, Zaka is a typical example. Through him, the filmmakers deeply emphasize a belief that the desire in the hearts of the people is to be a good person and to create their own respected life through their own labor. In terms of character, Raj is diverse, rich, and complex. Director and actor Raj Kapoor showed many-sided talent here. He makes Raj both kind and gentle, and rude and cold; both righteous and awe-inspiring, and cynical; Raj is both complex and simple. He relies on Zaka, and he plays with Zaka; he loves Rita, and he hits Rita; he refuses to be a robber, and he steals necklaces. On each of these contradictory sides, a living person appears, so the entire Raj shows the image of a complex injured person. If the director and actor could take more care of the interrelationships between contradictions, then the character he created might be more complete. For example, Raj's image after being released from prison is too vilified. Even when he met his mother (for the audience, this was the first time they had met since he was arrested twelve years ago), he was still a rogue, without any inner movement, which is not easy to understand. Twelve years of theft and prison life can make Raj cynical, but too much vilification, although it may have an effect on the surface dramatic effect of the film, it cannot be completely reconciled with Raj's leading character: honesty and kindness.

    Actor P. L. Kapoor was immersed in portraying Raghunath, a hypocritical, falsely firm, but actually very cowardly character. On the night of the thunder and lightning, between Bobby's threat and Leela's pleading, Raghunath stood in front of the door and dared not look Leela in the face. His facial muscles seemed to tremble, vividly portraying a hypocritical character without real backbone. This is consistent with his image of gritting his teeth and announcing that he would rather let Rita die than let Rita marry Raj. From here, people can fully understand Raghunath's hypocritical and ugly soul, and even imagine that his so-called belief is also a vulnerable thing in other situations.

    The image of Rita, who is beautiful, pure, lively, and full of a sense of justice, is a noble typical of Indian girls. Rita's happiness and sorrow are most touchingly expressed in the two songs of actress Nargis. The audience saw that Rita was not only singing with her voice, but also with her waist, with her arms, with her eyes, with her steps, that is, with her whole soul, singing her joy and烦恼. Creating such a complete image in order to save Raj may raise questions from the audience, but we welcome such a character type to appear in the ranks of opposing social injustice. This is something that should and can happen in real life.

    The film "The Vagabond" can not only capture the audience's emotions, but also dazzle people. The techniques of the talented director seem to be endless. He creates atmosphere, creates premonitions, uses many styles of foreshadowing and hints, and uses contrast and opposition. Sometimes he is concise, sometimes he lingers. The singing and dancing in the lives of the Indian people make Indian story films a comprehensive art that is not a so-called song and dance film, but also not a simple story film. There, music, singing, dance, language, and actions are all organic components of the plot. This uniqueness in Indian films enriches "The Vagabond," but it also increases its burden in some places. At the same time, the beautiful lyrical scenes turn coconut groves, pools, moons, clouds, and silhouettes into living things, sharing the fate with Raj and Rita. However, if the plot on the beach and in the boat were saved a little, the director's concise technique could be more prominent.

    The ending of "The Vagabond" makes Raj turn back to take his father's road, to become a judge, and the tragedy suddenly turns into a comedy. This is not very consistent with the main tone of the entire film, weakens the typicality of Raj's character, and has some anticlimactic effects in the audience's feelings. However, although from the perspective of a Chinese audience, "The Vagabond" has those individual weaknesses that even the best films can hardly completely avoid, it is a product of the lives of the Indian people, and it expresses the noble qualities of the Indian people, loving justice and bravely facing reality. They are a people who live vigorously and strongly. The film makes us know that their lives are poetry, music, and dance, and what runs through all this is their determination to overcome difficulties, in order to make life more reasonable and more in line with their own wishes.

    人民的正义的呼声
    ——印度电影“流浪者”观后
    杨刚

    印度拉兹·卡普尔电影公司出品  长春电影制片厂配音复制
    成千成万的中国人关心印度的一个流浪者。高高的喜马拉雅山隔不断人民的相互关怀。拉兹为了他的母亲，他的爱人，为了他自己生活的权利流了汗，流了泪，也流了血。他代表着一个时期中印度受侮辱和受损害的人民作了不平之鸣。他感动了我们。通过他，通过整个故事，我们觉得自己同印度人民更接近了。我们了解他们为什么笑，为什么哭，为什么愤怒；我们了解他们是怎样的聪明能干，了解他们有多么顽强。
    可以想像，影片的这种强烈的感染力，使从事译制工作的人们投进了他们的全部心灵和全部感情。这些中国艺术家们的深刻的、激动人心的表演，把这样一个复杂的外国影片变成了中国人民喜闻乐见的东西。
    印度影片“流浪者”是对社会不平的强烈抗议：它的复杂曲折的故事显露出人的命运和社会条件的不可分离的关系，贯穿着主张正义和人道的精神。本应该出身于富有家庭的拉兹，由于假正经的父亲法官拉贡纳特的偏见和懦怯，在母怀里就同母亲里列一道被赶到贫民窟里去了。他要养活他的母亲办不到，要读书办不到，要工作办不到。他能够接近的人是那些和他一样被侮辱和被损害的人，是那些为了肯定自己的存在，为了使自己活下去而对社会不平进行报复的人们，就是像札卡这样的强盗们。这样，拉兹就做了小偷和强盗，做了监犯和流浪者。中间他碰到了儿时的女友丽达，两人发生了爱情，为此，他决心放弃做贼的生活而走进工厂里去。但是，工厂却因为他曾经做贼而把他赶出去了。既不能做工，又不愿再做贼的拉兹经过了许多波折之后，走上了最后的一条绝路，为了母亲为了爱人而成了杀人犯。只有在他做了杀人犯之后，在法庭上，他才得到了一生中仅有的机会，为不平的人们发出了不平的呼声，为正义和人道作出了有力的呼吁。这是对于社会的强烈讽刺。
    由于故事的复杂曲折和演出的戏剧性，由于音乐和舞蹈的优美动人，影片是吸引人的。但是，深刻地抓住人心的却是在拉贡纳特和札卡这两种强烈地相对立的力量下面的人的命运。法官拉贡纳特处在一种能够叫人死也能够叫人活的地位上，相信好人的儿子一定是好人，坏人的儿子一定是坏人。他说这是他的信念是一点也不奇怪的。这正是一定的社会基础上产生的东西。拉贡纳特按照这种信念（其实是偏见）来执行他的职务，他坚决地要贯彻实现他的信念。强盗札卡受了这种信念的残害，于是也就坚决地顽强地要粉碎这种信念。这场针锋相对的尖锐斗争使法官的儿子成了父亲的罪恶的替祭羔羊，同时也使法官受到了他自己的信念和社会正义的裁判。在这里，编剧、导演和演员都是卓越地成功的。
    作为一个现实主义的作品，影片“流浪者”有一种高贵的格调。显然，一种同拉贡纳特的信念完全相反的信念促使整个影片的合作者们强调了劳动人民的真正要求。人民反对偷盗抢劫，反对杀人放火，他们要求用自己的劳动力去创造自己的受尊敬的生活。这就是同拉贡纳特的信念相反的东西。要做工，要做好人，这是拉兹从小到大永不泯灭的愿望和呼声。擦皮鞋，求札卡介绍工作，进工厂，这些都不用多说了。做了十二年强盗的拉兹，在监狱里还不肯忘记他怎样变成监犯的原因。他拿着一块饼说：“我家就没有这个东西！当初我家里要是有这块小东西，我就不致于遭到这样不幸的命运。就是因为这一块面包，十二年前头一次被送到这里来的。”不能用自己的劳动来创造自己的生活，不能不被迫去当强盗的命运使拉兹的心经常是鲜血淋漓的。他初见丽达，就忍不住要讲出他的实情；他就要指出：“有一些人尽做坏事，就因为他有钱，穿着漂亮衣服，人们都尊敬他称他为绅士。那些诚实的穷人，每天辛辛苦苦地做工还常常饿肚子，因为他买不起漂亮的衣服穿，人们说他是贼，是流浪儿，是罪犯，甚至还要把他送到监狱里去关起来。所以说，有钱的财主们才是真正的贼，和我一样！”正是因为愿望同现实的深刻矛盾刺伤了他的心，所以尽管他深爱丽达，但是在丽达叫他是“野人”的时候，他却会忘其所以地粗暴地痛打丽达。
    强烈的人的愿望尽管受到顽固的现实的无情压力，但是它却永不低头。札卡是盲目的反抗者的典型。他和拉兹同样有着做一个诚实的劳动者、一个好人的愿望。正是因为这种愿望被毁灭了，他才对毁灭他的愿望和生活的拉贡纳特抱了永不可解的仇恨。为了报复，为了粉碎那种毁灭了他的愿望的信念，为了做一个诚实的劳动者的道路对他已经关了门，他笔直朝着做强盗并且引诱拉兹做强盗的道路走去，决不回头。但是，札卡有没有矛盾呢？他为什么不敢肯定他自己和拉兹是好人呢？他为什么讽刺拉兹“你自己还以为你是个好人……”呢？他不能说他的道路是好的。但是，他却肯定他和拉兹只有一条不好的路可走。他说：“不管是谁，只要上了这条道，他就永远也别想再回头！”这里有着何等沉痛的心情！这是何等毛骨悚然的揭发和抗议。作为一个坚持反抗而不能辨明自己的道路的人，札卡是一个典型。影片的制作者们通过他深刻地强调一个信念，人民心底的愿望是要做一个好人，用自己的劳动来创造自己的受尊敬的生活。就性格来说，拉兹是多样的、丰富而又复杂的。导演兼演员的拉兹·卡普尔在这里表现了多方面的天才。他使拉兹又是善良温柔，又是粗暴冷酷；又是正义凛凛，又是玩世不恭；拉兹既复杂又单纯。他依靠札卡，他又玩弄札卡；他爱丽达，他又打丽达；他拒绝当强盗，他又去偷项链。在这些矛盾的每一面上都出现了一个活生生的人，因而整个的拉兹就显出了一个复杂的受损害者的形象。如果导演和演员能够更多地照顾到矛盾之间的相互关联，那末他所创造的人物可能就更加完整一些。譬如说，拉兹出狱之后的形象是过于丑化了一些。甚至在他和母亲见面的时候（对于观众这是他十二年前被捕之后第一次见面），他也是一付痞子形象，内心毫无所动，这是不容易为人所理解的。十二年的盗窃和监犯生活可以使拉兹玩世不恭，但是过多的丑化尽管可能在影片的表面戏剧效果上有作用，它同拉兹的主导性格：正直和善良却不能完全调和。
    演员普·拉·卡普尔入神地刻划了一个假正经、假坚定而其实是十分懦怯的人物——拉贡纳特。雷电之夜，在巴比的威胁和里列的哀求之间，拉贡纳特站在门前不敢正视里列。他的面部肌肉似乎在颤动，活刻出一个虚伪的、并无真正骨气的人物。这同他咬牙切齿地宣布宁可让丽达死，也不让丽达嫁拉兹的时候的形象是一致的。人们从这里完全可以了解拉贡纳特的虚伪丑恶的灵魂，甚至可以设想他的所谓信念在另外的情况下也是不堪一击的东西。
    优美、纯洁、活泼而又富于正义感的丽达的形象，是印度少女的高贵的典型。丽达的快乐和忧愁在演员纳尔吉斯的两段歌唱中得到最感人的表现。观众看到丽达不仅是用声音在唱歌，而且是用她的腰支，用她的手臂，用她的眼睛，用她的脚步，就是用她的全灵魂在歌唱她的欢乐和烦恼。为了挽救拉兹而创造这样一个完整的形象可能引起观众的问题，但是，我们欢迎在反对社会不平的行列中，出现这样一个性格典型。这是现实生活中应该而且能够发生的。
    影片“流浪者”不但能抓住观众的感情，它也使人们眼花撩乱。天才的导演的手法好像是无穷的。他创造气氛，制造预感，使用了许多式样的伏笔和暗示，使用了对照和对立。有时他是简洁的，有时他却留连忘返。印度人民生活中的歌唱和舞蹈使印度的故事电影成了一种不是所谓歌舞片，但也不是单纯的故事片的综合艺术。在那里，音乐、歌唱、舞蹈、语言、动作都是情节中的有机成分。印度电影中的这种独特性丰富了“流浪者”，但是有的地方也增加了它的负担。同时，美丽的抒情场面把椰子林、水池、月亮、云彩、人影都变成了有生命的东西，同拉兹和丽达共了命运。但是，海滩上和小船中的情节如果节省一些，就可以使导演的简洁手法更为突出。
    “流浪者”的结局使拉兹回头去走他父亲的路，去当法官，悲剧忽然变了喜剧。这同整个影片的主要格调不大相符，削弱了拉兹的性格的典型性，在观众的感受中是有一些反高潮的作用的。但是，尽管从一个中国观众看来，“流浪者”有那种最好的影片都难以完全避免的个别弱点，它却是印度人民生活里的产物，它表现了印度人民的高尚品质，热爱正义，勇敢地面对现实。他们是生气勃勃地、强烈地生活着的人民。影片使我们知道他们的生活是诗，是音乐，是舞蹈，而贯穿着这一切的是他们坚决地要战胜困难，为了使生活更加合理，更加合乎自己的愿望。
