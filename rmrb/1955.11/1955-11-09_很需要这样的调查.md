    Such Investigation is Very Necessary
    The Fujian Province Cultural Supplies Company recently did a very meaningful job: it sent a visiting team to four agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Fuzhou to see what kind of cultural supplies they needed. The results showed that farmers needed more and more varieties and quantities of cultural supplies. Taking account books as an example, they need journals, ledgers, and subsidiary ledgers. As for office supplies, they need ink, stencil paper, carbon paper, abacuses, and a total of more than 20 kinds. As for recreational supplies, they need chess, playing cards, ping-pong balls, and so on. Many members want to participate in people's schools and winter studies, and they generally need rubber-tipped pencils and fountain pens worth about one yuan.
    According to the new needs after rural cooperativization, this cultural supplies company is formulating a rural cultural supplies supply plan.
    The countryside is changing, and the needs of the masses are also changing. All commercial departments that serve the production and consumption of the masses should constantly conduct such investigations and research to do their work better.

    很需要这样的调查
    福建省文化用品公司最近作了一件很有意义的工作：派遣一个访问队到福州市郊的四个农业合作社进行访问，看看他们需要些什么样的文化用品。结果发现农民需要的文化用品的花样越来越多，数量越来越大。拿账簿说，就需要日记账、分类账和分户明细账。拿办公用品来说，就需要油墨、蜡纸、复写纸、算盘，共二十几种。拿文娱用品来说，就需要象棋、扑克、乒乓球，等等。许多社员要参加民校和冬学，普遍需要橡皮头铅笔和价值一元左右的钢笔。
    这个文化用品公司根据农村合作化以后的新需要，正在制定农村文化用品供应工作方案。
    农村在变化，群众的需要也在变化。一切为群众的生产和消费服务的商业部门，都应该不断进行这样的调查研究，把自己的工作做得更好些。
