Xinhua News Agency, New York, 19th - TASS reports from New York: The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association organized a mass meeting in New York on the evening of November 16th to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution and the 22nd anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Dr. Kingsbury, Chairman of the National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association, called on the meeting to intensify the struggle for peace and to strengthen friendship among the people of all countries.

Then Dworkin spoke, who had participated in the US youth delegation's visit to the Soviet Union. He said that they are currently introducing the situation of their visit to the Soviet Union to American youth, and that American youth are eager to exchange delegations more extensively with Soviet youth.

Reverend Melish, a prominent American social activist, said that the rigid attitude of the US government delegation at the recent Foreign Ministers' Conference of the Four Powers was contrary to the wishes of the American people. He said that the American people's reception of the Soviet agricultural delegation and the admiration shown for the performances of Soviet pianist Gilels in the United States more accurately reflected the sentiments of the American people. Melish concluded by saying that Dulles could not "push back the tide of hope" caused by the "Geneva spirit".

E. Robertson read a letter from Paul Robeson at the meeting, in which Paul Robeson expressed "deep gratitude and love" to the Soviet people.

The final speaker was Pickett, the head of the Quaker delegation that recently visited the Soviet Union. He introduced the life and work of the Soviet people.

　　美苏友好协会在纽约举行群众大会
　　庆祝十月革命节和美苏建交二十二周年
    新华社十九日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：美苏友好协会全国理事会十一月十六日晚间在纽约组织了一次群众大会，庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命三十八周年和美苏两国建交二十二周年。
    美苏友好协会全国理事会主席金斯伯利博士在会上号召为争取和平、加强各国人民之间的友谊而加紧斗争。
    接着德沃尔金讲话，他曾经参加美国青年代表团访问苏联。他说，他们目前正在向美国青年介绍访问苏联的情况，美国青年渴望同苏联青年更加广泛地交换代表团。
    美国著名的社会活动家麦利希牧师说，美国政府代表团在最近的四国外交部长会议上的死硬态度是违反美国人民的愿望的。他说，美国人民接待苏联农业代表团的情况和对苏联钢琴家基列尔斯在美国演出表示的赞佩都比较正确地反映了美国人民的情绪。麦利希最后说，杜勒斯不可能把“日内瓦精神”所引起的“希望的浪潮推回去”。
    埃·罗伯逊在会上宣读了保罗·罗伯逊的一封信，保罗·罗伯逊在信中向苏联人民表示“深深的感谢和热爱”。
    最后发言的是不久以前访问苏联的公谊会代表团团长皮克特。他介绍了苏联人民的生活和劳动情况。
