Several Enrollments, Final Decision
　　"Enrollment in the cooperative can be repeated several times, with a final decision, so that farmers have ample room for consideration." (See the "Resolution on Agricultural Cooperation" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party) Some townships in Wuming County, Guangxi, have already done this.
　　During the ideological mobilization period for building cooperatives in Shuangqiao Township, farmers who wanted to join the cooperative had already registered twice; at the end of the "Three Evaluations," another enrollment for the cooperative was conducted. During the period of building cooperatives, it was precisely when many farmers were undecided. Some people, after hearing about the benefits of joining the cooperative, were willing to join; after considering some specific issues, they would regret it after enrolling. Some people felt embarrassed not to enroll when they saw others enrolling; but they felt uncomfortable after enrolling. Fang Yuru, a wealthy middle peasant in Shuangqiao Township, was such a person. He was afraid of suffering losses by joining the cooperative, and also afraid that people would say he was "backward" if he didn't join, so he sold his cattle first, and then enrolled in the cooperative. After explaining the principle of voluntary mutual benefit to him again, he decided not to enroll for the time being. Some who were originally ideologically wavering enrolled the first time but not the second time, and after thinking it through, enrolled the third time.
　　It can be seen that the method of "several enrollments, final decision" is completely correct, so that the newly built cooperatives can have a higher quality.

### 几次报名，最后定案

　  几次报名，最后定案
    “入社报名可以反复几次，最后定案，使农民有充分考虑的余地。”（见中共七届六中全会关于农业合作化问题的决议）广西武鸣县有一些乡已经这样做了。
    双桥乡在建社的思想发动期间，已经让要求入社的农民报了两次名；在“三评”结束的时候，又一次进行了入社报名。建社期间，正是许多农民拿不定主意的时候，有些人听到讲入社的好处，愿意入社了；再考虑到一些具体问题，报名后又会后悔。有些人看到别人报名自己不好意思不报；报了以后心里却有些不痛快。双桥乡富裕中农方玉如就是这样一个人。他怕入社吃亏，又怕不入社人家说自己“落后”，就先把牛卖了，然后报名入社。又一次向他说明自愿互利原则，他就决定暂时不报名。有些原来思想不坚定的，第一次报了第二次没报，想通以后第三次又报上了。
    可见“几次报名，最后定案”的办法完全正确，这样才可以保证新建的合作社具有较高的质量。
