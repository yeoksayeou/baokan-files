    Hubei Province has, for the first time this year, promoted the planting of 140,000 mu of Shengli rapeseed. 100,000 jin of Shengli rapeseed seeds, transferred from Sichuan Province, have been distributed to a wide area covering more than fifty counties, and farmers are sowing them in a timely manner.

    Last winter, Hubei Province conducted trial plantings of Shengli rapeseed in several areas with different natural conditions, proving that it can increase rapeseed yield by 30 to 50 jin per mu compared to local rapeseed, and the oil extraction rate is also higher. This year's promotion of Shengli rapeseed, calculated at an increase of 30 jin of rapeseed per mu, can increase rapeseed production by 4.2 million jin, and will create conditions for the province's rapeseed variety replacement next year.

    湖北种植胜利油菜十四万亩
    湖北省今年第一次推广种植胜利油菜十四万亩。由四川省调往的胜利油菜良种十万斤，已经分配到五十多个县的广大地区，农民正在适时播种。
    湖北省去年冬季曾在不同自然条件的几个地区，试种胜利油菜，证明比本地油菜每亩能增产菜籽三十斤到五十斤不等，而且出油率高。今年推广种植的胜利油菜，每亩以增产三十斤菜籽计算，能增产四百二十万斤菜籽，并且将为明年全省的油菜换种创造条件。（袁军）
