　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 14th: According to TASS, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary session in Budapest from November 9th to 12th. The meeting heard and discussed the political bureau's summary report "Political and Economic Situation and Party's Tasks" made by Rakosi, First Secretary of the Central Committee, and the report "Tasks on Improving Industrial Production and Raising the Technical Level of Industrial Production" made by Mekish, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee on behalf of the Political Bureau.

　　The meeting adopted corresponding resolutions on the reports discussed.

　　The resolution on improving industrial production and raising the technical level of industrial production pointed out that during the period of the first Five-Year Plan (1950-1954), great achievements were made in the country's socialist industrialization. Industrial production in 1954 increased by 131 percent compared with 1949, which was about three times that of 1938. The proportion of industry in national income has accounted for 63.9 percent. The total output of industries producing means of production increased by 188 percent in five years, while the machinery manufacturing industry increased by 267 percent. The technical level of heavy industry has been improved. Various sectors of the national economy are equipped with modern production tools. Socialist economic sectors have reached 97 percent of the entire industry.

　　Industrial production continued to develop in 1955. The achievements already made prove that the policy of socialist industrialization prioritizing the development of heavy industry is correct.

　　The plenary session then pointed out that in order to ensure the correct further development of the national economy and to achieve greater achievements in the second Five-Year Plan, effective measures must be taken to rapidly improve the technical level of industry, further improve labor productivity, reduce costs, and improve product quality.

　　The plenary session emphasized that while ensuring the completion of the national economic plan, the technical level of production should be rapidly improved, thereby ensuring a faster increase in labor productivity. In order to solve this task, it is required to prioritize the development of heavy industry, while realizing widespread overall mechanization, electrification, and automation.

　　The plenary session also pointed out that in order to peacefully use atomic energy, first of all to establish the first domestic atomic power station, it is necessary to greatly promote the use of radioactive isotopes in industry, and prepare for and start producing the instruments and equipment necessary for the development of atomic technology.

    新华社十四日讯　据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会十一月九日到十二日在布达佩斯举行全体会议。会议听取了并且讨论了中央委员会第一书记拉科西所作的政治局总结报告“政治和经济状况以及党的任务”和中央委员会政治局委员麦基什代表政治局所作的“关于改进工业生产和提高工业生产的技术水平的任务”的报告。
    会议就所讨论的报告通过了相应的决议。
    关于改进工业生产和提高工业生产的技术水平的决议指出，在第一个五年计划（一九五零—一九五四年）的时期内，在国家社会主义工业化方面获得了巨大的成就。一九五四年的工业生产比一九四九年增加了百分之一百三十一，约为一九三八年的三倍。工业在国民收入中的比重已占百分之六十三点九。生产生产资料的工业的总产量在五年中增加了百分之一百八十八，而机器制造业增加了百分之二百六十七。重工业的技术水平提高了。国民经济各部门装备着近代化的生产工具。社会主义生产成分在整个工业中已达到百分之九十七。
    一九五五年工业生产继续发展。已经取得的成果证明，优先发展重工业的社会主义工业化的政策是正确的。
    全体会议接着指出，为了保证国民经济正确的进一步发展和在第二个五年计划中达到更大的成就，必须采取有效措施尽速提高工业的技术水平，进一步提高劳动生产率，降低成本和改进产品质量。
    全体会议着重指出，在保证完成国民经济计划的同时，应该迅速地提高生产技术水平，从而保证更快地提高劳动生产率。为了解决这个任务，要求优先发展重工业，同时实现广泛的全盘机械化、电气化和自动化。
    全体会议还指出，为了和平使用原子能，首先为了建立第一个本国原子电力站，必须在工业中大大推广放射性同位素的使用，准备和开始生产为发展原子技术所必需的仪器和设备。
