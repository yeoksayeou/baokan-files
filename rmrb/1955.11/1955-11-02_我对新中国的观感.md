    My Impressions of New China
    By Jean-Paul Sartre, France

    This great country is constantly transforming. By the time I arrived here, what my French friends had said about China after returning to France was no longer entirely accurate. And a week from now, what I say won't be completely accurate either. I stayed in Shenyang for less than a week, and by the time I returned to Beijing, Beijing's appearance had changed in some streets and districts: some houses had been completed, and others were under construction. For someone like me who comes to such a country for forty-five days, a country with such a rich history and such a dynamic present, the best thing to do is to remain silent. However, my Chinese friends want me to talk about my impressions of China. I think they want to know what things catch the attention of a traveler who is most unfamiliar with the situation. If that's the case, unfamiliarity becomes an advantage, and initial impressions may contain some truth. What I saw is what everyone can see: China has shown its all-encompassing face. As for specific truths, that's for the experts to figure out next.

    As you can imagine, the first thing that strikes you is the magnitude of your task. A few years ago, according to you, your country was still a "semi-feudal and semi-colonial" country. In some areas, the lives of your peasants were not much different from a thousand years ago. Now you have decided to catch up with a thousand years of history in fifty years, and to thoroughly change your economic system, social structure, and even your language. One can imagine the greatness of this undertaking by reading your books and reports in Paris. But to truly grasp the scale of this greatness, one must come here in person, visit the large factories in the Northeast, walk through your countryside on the way back, and see the blast furnaces of Anshan and the nearby rural villages with earthen walls and thatched huts on the same day, where some farmers are still tilling the land by hand. Every day, every glance, one must see both ancient China and future China at the same time in order to understand that your current situation is precisely made up of this remarkable and vivid contradiction.

    This is the most superficial and hasty impression that one can get at any time. From the beginning, one can see the diversity of your undertakings: China must be able to manufacture its own airplanes, trucks, and tractors, but it must also eliminate illiteracy. At the same time, writers must also transform themselves and then transform their works to meet the needs of the new public. However, as long as one considers your various problems a little more deeply, especially when one hears your experts talk, one will find that all your tasks are interconnected and dovetail with each other, as if in everything, any consequence will be reflected in the cause, causing the cause to change again. Yes, only the development of heavy industry can provide farmers with tractors to complete agricultural collectivization. But, conversely, if the collectivization movement does not develop on a large scale in the countryside from today onwards, then China's socialist industrialization will encounter serious difficulties. In a completely different field, you want to use phonetic symbols to replace Chinese characters in order to simplify the learning of Chinese and to gain convenience in borrowing or formulating new technical terms. In this way, the reform of the script can better serve production. However, conversely, the unification of pronunciation is a prerequisite for script reform, and the unification of pronunciation largely depends on transportation: such as highways, railways, vehicles, etc. In short, industrial production in turn becomes a necessary tool for script reform. There are countless examples of this kind. If you do not patiently help a foreigner to understand, then he may get lost and wander around in vain when he sees the intricate relationship of all your undertakings. After a few days, what a foreigner will be surprised at is your foresight. He will soon realize that your government not only does not regard this intricate relationship as an additional difficulty, but also regards it as the most reliable way to achieve its goals. Your comprehensive spirit and dialectical spirit always deal with problems comprehensively. You never treat problems in isolation, you always combine the most different phenomena of your entire society. When listening to you, one will finally clearly understand how the progress of each specific department will promote the progress of all other departments.

    When we came to Beijing, please believe us, we Europeans had also read many books and articles about New China. However, these writers are all your friends, and they do not need to decide what measures should be taken, so they often have an involuntary tendency to emphasize the difficulties on your path forward that are like milestones. They worriedly said: "However, writing is what connects the different regions of China. If our Chinese friends Latinize the writing, then the cultural connections between the north and south, east and west of China will be damaged." Therefore, we came to your country with our minds full of these worrying questions, and at the same time heavily carrying many questions, slowly asking you. We noticed that you are always open to these questions, but you consider these questions from the perspective of implementation. You never look for excuses to delay. You only see from this what order the problems should be solved in. Therefore, the questions we want to ask you are not of much significance. Your answers lie in the organizational work and working methods. Since unifying pronunciation is a necessary condition for Latinizing writing, then that's okay, you first unify the language.

    This seems very simple, and people may say that this is just a matter of method. However, as long as you think about it a little, you will realize that even this preliminary task requires great effort. You calmly say, "It will probably take fifteen years." What makes people respect you is not only your vision, but also your infinite patience. Yes, it takes fifteen years to unify the language before the issue of Latinization can be addressed. After fifteen years, some of those who advocate script reform most enthusiastically may not see their wishes come true. It doesn't matter, they only need to work to realize this wish. Since there is only one road to the destination, then it doesn't matter whether you walk a longer or shorter distance on this road. The people will not die, and they are convinced that they can reach the end of this road. It is precisely for this reason that we are often very touched to see many engineers, workers, and farmers, like prophets, naturally depict to us a future society that they cannot see themselves but that their children will replace them in seeing. An engineer in Fushun told me very calmly: "There are mineral deposits under this city, and we are going to move this city away." He smiled slightly, feeling that it was also pleasant to live in a temporary city. This city is indeed temporary, but it may be longer than the engineer's lifetime. In the south, an agronomist was doing some grafting experiments, and he said: "We are going to transplant the fruit trees of the plains to these hillsides." He pointed to those hills for me to see: in his eyes, these hillsides were already full of banana trees and papaya trees; I seemed to see the scene he saw. That day, Simone de Beauvoir said to me: "In China, a Frenchman feels like he is already a dead man." This is true, because by the time the bananas grow on the mountains and the city of Fushun moves, we will no longer be here. But in China, direct reality is the future, so what we see through your eyes is the world we have left. But please don't think that this makes us feel sad. On the contrary, you have passed on your patience and humility to us. Thanks to you, thanks to your labor, thanks to your beliefs, the future is already in sight. I have always felt that if everyone died with me, then I would die very sadly. If humanity still lives after my death, and I can clearly know in what direction humanity is advancing, then the question of my personal life and death is irrelevant.

    The reason why we trust you so much is undoubtedly because when you talk about work, you do not hide the difficulties, nor do you hide the mistakes. Especially because the progress of the Chinese people gives foreigners a very deep impression in two aspects, and these two aspects are complementary and also inseparable. What I want to emphasize today are these two aspects.

    Indeed, on the one hand, it is clear that you have no other choice than what you are doing now. Your march towards socialism is not only a great nation's effort to build a more humane and just social system; in China, socialistization is a vital issue of survival. You may say: it's the same everywhere. Yes, it is. But nowhere else is the objective necessity of socialistization as clear and obvious as it is here. This is also the ultimate goal of the Chinese people's struggle against oppression for thousands of years, and it is a matter of life and death for present-day China and future China. If industrial and agricultural production are not increased, how can we get rid of poverty? If a strict planned economy does not replace free capitalism, how can production be increased? China must either perish or move towards socialism; it must either perish or become a very powerful country. However, just look at your happy youth and children, and you will understand that this country will certainly not perish.

    However, this requirement is very strict, and China's history and current situation make it an extremely urgent construction task. There is also another aspect, which even a tourist who is merely passing through this vast country can see. Because I can't find a more appropriate word, let's call this aspect a deep humanism. In saying this, I am not only referring to the admirable patience shown by a nation with a very clear direction, which does not allow for backsliding or stagnation, but also to the nation's unwillingness to force anyone, but instead using explanation, persuasion, and reasoning to replace issuing orders. I am especially thinking of this admirable spirit of "Everyone for me, I for everyone." This spirit did not fall from the sky and land on China's head, but is precisely the fruit of your progress, and also the necessary method for you to continue to move forward. In the future, you will certainly use the powerful strength of industrial production to improve the lives of the people. However, your heavy industry is just beginning to be built. Nearly 600 million Chinese people rely entirely on the land to make a living. When a foreigner crosses the great plains of China, he is bewildered by this special situation: no tractors, few livestock, few trees, many people, their shadows reflected endlessly on the earth. At present, there is no other way to increase agricultural production other than to change the relationship between these people. First of all, they liberated themselves from oppression, exploitation, hunger, material deprivation, and ignorance. Because they gained freedom, production has already increased. But in order to further increase production, it is necessary to rationalize production and establish mutual aid groups and production cooperatives. In this way, if they increase production, it is because their relationship with each other has become closer. I know that you do not like unreserved praise. You have told me about the commandism and subjectivism of some bureaucrats, and some rich people have been causing trouble. You have told me that some places force farmers to join cooperatives, and some places restrict the development of collectivization regardless of the wishes of the workers. You are constantly exposing and correcting these inevitable mistakes. These mistakes do not affect the main point, which is that friendship has become the driving force of production. Today, China is still poor, and what deeply moves us is the mutual assistance of these poor people. We must fight flies, fight rats, fight germs, fight floods or droughts. Every struggle is like a crusade, the entire masses are mobilized, and its achievement is not only the elimination of 120 million rats, but also the establishment of friendship among hundreds of millions of people. I deeply admire that in your country, the masses are constantly influencing themselves and are liberated through a mutual promotion, which constantly makes everyone and everyone closer. You still lack schools. But it doesn't matter, every literate Chinese can teach another Chinese. That is to say, every literate Chinese will become a friend of another Chinese. It is because of this situation that socialism is both a most strict necessity and embodies the most humane relationship between people. To me - and I believe to most people who visit China - what moves me most deeply is this dual face of New China.

    Is it still necessary for me, after many others in my country, to refute the arguments of certain newspapers and confirm your universal desire for peace? Here, we again encounter a concrete fact that is complementary in two aspects. On the one hand, those who learn to love each other can never attempt to launch a war. When a country becomes fierce and warlike, it is because its political system makes it so miserable that its own people hate each other. But on the other hand, for China, maintaining peace is an obvious objective necessity: what China is building and pointing out, the future, is the future that the Chinese people care about, and only peace can guarantee this undertaking. To this great country, which has suffered so much and is able to disregard old hatreds today, the French people can only have one emotion: friendship. (Special Contribution to this Newspaper)

    我对新中国的观感
    法国  让·保罗·萨特
    这个伟大的国家正不断地在转变。当我到达这里的时候，我那一些法国朋友们从中国回到法国后所讲的情况已经不再完全正确。等过了一个星期，我再说的话，也不会是完全正确的了。我在沈阳住了不到一个星期，等我回到北京的时候，北京的面貌，在某些街道上和某些市区里已经变了样子：有一些房子已经完工，另外一些又在动工。像我这样一个人来到这样一个国家住了四十五天，而这个国家的历史是那么样的丰富，它当前的情况又是那么样富有活力，所以最好的办法只有不讲话。可是，我的中国朋友们却要我谈谈对于中国的感想。我认为他们想知道的是，那一些事情引起了一个最不了解情况的旅客的注意。既然是这样的话，不了解情况倒变成了一种优点，而初步的印象也许会包含一些真理。我所看到的也就是大家都看得到的东西：中国已经显示了它的无所不包的容貌。至于一些特定的真理，那是下一步专家们的事情。
    正如你们可以想像得到的，首先令人吃惊的是你们任务的巨大。在几年以前，照你们的说法，你们的国家还是一个“半封建和半殖民地”的国家。在好些地区，你们农民的生活还和一千年以前没有多大区别。你们现在决定用五十年的时间，来追上一千年的历史，把你们的经济制度、社会结构、甚至语言文字，都彻底改变。关于这一事业的伟大性，人们在巴黎读了你们的书籍，看了你们的报告，也还是可以想像得到的。可是要真正掌握这个伟大性的尺度，那却非得要亲自来到你们这里，参观了东北的大工厂，在归途走过你们的农村，在同一天里面，看到了鞍山的高炉和附近土墙茅舍的乡村，农民们有的还在徒手耕作。每一天，每看一眼，必定要同时看到古老的中国和未来的中国，才能够懂得你们当前的情况正是这个了不起的和生动的矛盾所构成的。
    这就是不管什么时候都可以使人得到的一种最肤浅和最仓促的观感。一开始，人们就看得到你们事业的多种多样性：中国必定要能够自己制造飞机、载重汽车、拖拉机，但也必定要扫除文盲，同时作家也必定要改造自己，然后改造他们的作品，以便适应新的公众的需要。但是，只要对你们的各种问题做了稍为深入一些的考虑，特别是，只要听到你们专家的谈话，人们就会发现，你们的一切任务都是互相联系着的，都是彼此锲合着的，好像在每一件事情里面，任何后果都会反映到原因上来，使原因再起变化。不错，只有发展重工业才能使农民得到拖拉机来完成农业集体化。但是，反过来说，如果集体化运动不从今天起就在农村中大规模发展起来，那末中国的社会主义工业化就会遇到严重的困难。在完全另外一个领域内，你们想用音符来代替汉字，以便简化汉文的学习，并且在借用或制定新的技术名词时获得便利。这样一来，文字的改革就更可以为生产服务了。然而，反过来说，发音的统一是文字改革的先决条件，而发音的统一又大部分要依靠交通：如公路、铁路、车辆等等，总而言之，工业生产又反过来变成文字改革的必要工具。这样的例子是举不胜举的。如果你们不耐心地帮助一个外国人来了解的话，那末，他看到了你们一切事业的错综关系，也许会弄得迷失路途，白白地转起圈子来。过了几天，一个外国人所感到惊讶的，将是你们的远见。他很快就会察觉到，你们的政府不但不把这种错综的关系看做是额外的困难，而且还把它当做是达到目的的最可靠的方法。你们的综合精神和辩证精神总是全面地来处理问题。你们决不肯孤立地对待问题，你们总是把你们整个社会最不相同的现象结合起来看的。在听你们谈话的时候，人们终于会清楚地了解到，每一个特定部门的进步，怎样会促进其他一切部门的进步。
    当我们来到北京的时候，请你们相信吧，我们这些欧洲人也曾读过许多有关新中国的书籍和文章。但是，这些作家都是你们的朋友，究竟应该采取些什么办法并不需要他们来决定，所以他们往往不由自主地有一种倾向，即强调你们前进的道路上那些像里程碑似的困难。他们担心地说：“不过，文字是在中国各个不同地区发生联系作用的呀。假如我们的中国朋友们把文字拉丁化起来，那末，中国的北部同南部，东部同西部的文化联系，就会受到破坏的呀。”因此，我们来到贵国，心里面充满了这一类令人担心的问题，同时也沉重地带着许许多多问题，慢慢地向你们提出。我们察觉到，你们对于这些问题是没有不接头的，但是你们是从实行方面来考虑这些问题的。你们决不从这里面找一些借口来推拖。你们只在这里面看出，应该依着什么次序来解决问题。因此，我们想向你们提出的问题，就没有多大意义了。你们的解答就在组织工作和工作方式里面。既然统一发音是文字拉丁化的必要条件，那不要紧，你们就先把语言统一起来。
    这看起来似乎很简单，人们也许会说，这不过是一个方法问题。但是，只要稍为想一想，人们就会察觉到，仅仅这一个初步任务就已经需要极大的努力。你们镇静地说：“大概需要十五年。”你们使人家不能不肃然起敬的，不仅是你们的远见，而且还有你们那种无限的耐性。不错，统一语言需要十五年，然后才能够处理拉丁化问题。过了十五年，有些主张文字改革最为热烈的人，也许已经看不见他们的意愿变成现实。没有关系，他们只要为了实现这个意愿而工作就够了。既然走向目的地的道路只有一条，那末在这条路上多走一段或是少走一段，是没有什么关系的。人民是不会死亡的，他们确信自己能够走到这条路的终点。正就是因为这个缘故，所以我们时常非常感动地看到，许多工程师、工人、农民，像未卜先知的人那样很自然地对我们描绘一个他们自己看不到而要等儿女们来代替他们看到的未来社会。有一位工程师在抚顺很安详地告诉我说：“这个城下面有矿苗，我们要把这个城搬开。”他微微含笑，觉得住在一个临时的城里也很愉快。这个城固然是临时的，但是比起这位工程师的寿命来，也许还会长一些。在南方，一位农学家做了一些接种的试验，他说：“我们要把平原的果树都移植到这些山坡上去。”他指着那些山给我看：在他眼睛里看起来，这些山坡都已经长满了香蕉树和木瓜树；我似乎也看到了他所看见的景象。这一天，西蒙娜·德波娃对我说：“在中国，一个法国人自己觉得已经是一个死人。”这话是真的，因为，等到香蕉在山上长起来，抚顺城搬了地方，我们也已经不在了。但是在中国，直接的现实是未来，所以我们通过你们的眼睛所看到的是我们已经离去了的世界。但是，请你们不要以为这会使我们感觉哀伤，恰恰相反，你们把你们的耐心和虚怀若谷的风度传给了我们。由于你们，由于你们的劳动，由于你们的信念，未来已经在眼前。我一向觉得，如果所有的人都和我一道死亡，那末，我将死得非常难过。如果，人类在我死后还活着，而且我还能够清楚地知道人类朝着什么方向前进，那末，我个人的生死问题是无所谓的。
    我们之所以会这样地信任你们，无疑是因为你们在谈工作的时候，毫不隐讳困难，也毫不掩饰错误。尤其是因为中国人民的进步从两方面给外国人非常深刻的印象，而这两方面是相辅相成的，同时也是不可分割的。我今天要强调的就是这两方面。
    的确，从一方面说起来，你们显然除了现在所作的也不能有其他的作法。你们走向社会主义，这不仅是一个伟大的民族为了建立一种更人道和更公正的社会制度而努力；在中国，社会主义化是一个生死存亡的重要问题。你们也许会说：这在到处都是一样。不错，是这样的。但是，在任何其他地方，社会主义化的客观必要性也没有这样的鲜明显著。这同时也是中国人民千百年来为反对压迫而进行斗争的最终目的，对于现在的中国和未来的中国来说，都是一个有关生死存亡的问题。假使不提高工业和农业生产，如何能够从贫困中解脱出来呢？假使不以严格的计划经济来代替自由资本主义，又如何能够提高生产呢？中国必须或者灭亡，或者走向社会主义；它必须或者灭亡，或者变成一个非常强大的国家。然而，只要看一看你们如此欢乐的青年和儿童，就会理会出这个国家一定不会灭亡。
    但是，这种要求非常严格，而且中国的历史和今天的情况都使之成为极其迫切的建设工作，还有另外一方面，这连一个仅仅路过这个广大国家的游客也会看得出来的。这一方面，由于我找不到更恰当的字眼，就称之为深切的人道主义吧。在这样说的时候，我不仅是指一个民族有了非常明确的方向，既不容许开倒车，也不容许停顿不前而表现出来的令人钦佩的耐心，而且是指这个民族不愿意强迫任何人，而是用解释、说服和讲理来代替发号施令。我特别想到这种值得钦佩的“人人为我，我为人人”的精神。这种精神并不是从天上掉下来落在中国的头上的，而正是你们在前进中产生的果实，也就是你们继续前进的必要方法。将来，你们一定会用工业生产的强大力量来改善人民群众的生活。但是，你们的重工业还刚刚在开始建设。将近六亿的中国人民完全要靠土地来维持生活。当一个外国人穿过中国的大平原时，他看到这种特殊的情况不禁感到惶惑：没有拖拉机，牲畜不多，树木很少，很多的人，他们的影子无边地反映在大地上。目前，除了改变这些人彼此之间的关系以外，别无其他办法来提高农业生产。首先，他们把自己从压迫、剥削、饥饿、物质上的欠缺和愚昧中解放了出来。由于他们得到了自由，生产已经提高了。但是，为了使生产更进一步地提高，必须使生产合理化，建立互助组和生产合作社。这样，如果他们提高了生产，那是由于他们人与人之间的关系密切起来了。我知道，你们不喜欢无保留的赞扬。你们曾和我讲过某些官僚主义者的命令主义和主观主义的作风，也有些有钱人从中捣乱。你们曾经告诉我有些地方强迫农民加入合作社，有些地方不顾劳动者的意愿而限制了集体化的发展。这些不可避免的错误，你们都不断地在揭发和纠正。这些错误并不能影响那主要之点，即：友爱变成了生产的原动力。今天，中国还是贫困的，而使我们深刻感动的，就是那些贫穷人们的互助。必须向苍蝇进行斗争，向老鼠进行斗争，向细菌进行斗争，向水灾或干旱进行斗争。每一次斗争都是像十字军一样，全体群众都动员起来了，而它的成就不仅是消灭了一亿两千万只老鼠，而是友谊在亿万人民当中建立起来了。我非常钦佩在你们的国家里，群众不断地自己影响自己，并且通过一种互相推动而得到解放，这种互相推动不断地使每一个人和大家都更加密切起来。你们还缺少学校。但这并没有关系，每一个识字的中国人都可以去教另一个中国人。这就是说，每一个识字的中国人都将成为另一个中国人的朋友。就是因为这种情况，所以社会主义既是一种最严格的必要，同时又体现了人与人之间最合乎人情的关系。对我说来——同时我相信对大多数来中国访问的人也是如此——使我感动得最深刻的就是新中国的这种双重面貌。
    难道还需要我在我的国家里在很多其他人士之后去驳斥某些报纸的论调，而证实你们对和平的普遍愿望吗？这里，我们又遇到一件在两方面相辅相成的具体事实。一方面，凡是学习要互相友爱的人决不可能企图发动战争。当一个国家变成凶蛮好战的时候，那是由于它的政治制度使得它困苦到本国人民都彼此仇恨。但是，在另一方面，对中国来说，维护和平是一个再明显不过的客观的必要因素：中国所建设的和指出的前途，是中国人民唯一关怀的前途，只有和平能够成为这种事业的保障。对这个曾经遭受过多少苦难，而且今天又能够不计较旧日仇恨的伟大国家，法国人民只能抱有一种情感，那就是：友谊。　（本报特约稿）
