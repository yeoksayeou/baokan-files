　　“Hypocrisy is an ugly word. But to accurately describe the attitude of Western governments toward the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference... hypocrisy is really the only word." This is what American columnist Alsop Brothers wrote in the "Washington Post" on October 24.
　　The Alsop brothers believe that the hypocrisy of Western countries lies in the fact that "the difference between what their politicians say in public and what they talk about when they are together has never been as striking as it is now." In public, they pretend to "encourage" the "Geneva spirit," but in private, they are holding a series of "busy, almost feverish" meetings. According to someone who participated in these meetings, the theme of the meetings was to study "how to put on the best face for the setbacks we (referring to Western countries) cannot but anticipate" at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.
　　The so-called "unavoidable setbacks" indicate that Western countries are fully aware that the position they have taken at the Foreign Ministers' Conference will cause difficulties in resolving the problems facing the conference.
　　The Alsop brothers pointed out that on the issue of European security and Germany, the three Western countries intend to stick to their unworkable plan, forcing the Soviet Union to agree to "merge" the two parts of Germany and drag the "merged" Germany into the North Atlantic Group. The Alsop brothers said this is because "a large and growing number of decision-makers in the United States, Britain, and France are now worried about a terrible prospect, that at some point in the future... the Germans will decide to abandon the Western alliance in exchange for unification."
　　The Alsop brothers particularly ridiculed the U.S. position on disarmament. The Alsop brothers said: U.S. decision-makers are trying to "convince the United States and the world that the U.S. government believes disarmament will be easy as long as a sound inspection system can be developed first... But in fact, even if the Soviet Union agrees to a strict inspection system, disarmament is still not easy. At present, the United Kingdom, France, and the United States do not have a mutually agreed disarmament plan. Even the United States does not have a mutually agreed plan."
　　The Alsop brothers said that if the United States is to propose any serious disarmament plan, the United States will "have to make profound and painful national choices," and the United States is "extremely unprepared" for this choice. The Alsop brothers pointed out that the entire U.S. military plan is currently "formulated around nuclear weapons," and "any genuine disarmament plan must, of course, include a ban on the use of atomic weapons." This is precisely what the United States is most unwilling to do.
　　Therefore, the U.S. propaganda on disarmament is completely "bluffing." According to the Alsop brothers, British Foreign Office experts have warned the State Department that if this "bluff" is exposed by the Soviet Union, then, because Western countries "actually do not have a mutually agreed disarmament plan, the embarrassment will not be easy to cover up."
　　The Alsop brothers' ridicule is not because they are disgusted with this attitude of the United States, but because they believe that the United States does not need any disguise to deny the "Geneva spirit." The Alsop brothers compared the United States to the stupid king in Andersen's fairy tale "The Emperor's New Clothes," and the "Geneva spirit" to the magic clothes customized by the king. The Alsop brothers believe that "there are actually no clothes at all," that is, there is no "Geneva spirit" at all, "but because it is said that these clothes are magic clothes, neither the king nor his ministers dare to say that they cannot see these beautiful clothes. Therefore, the king travels naked, boasting about how beautiful his imaginary clothes are."
　　However, the "Geneva spirit" is not a virtual "magic clothes." The Alsop brothers' analogy is only correct on this point: If the United States abandons the "Geneva spirit" at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, and still believes that it can use optimistic platitudes about the "Geneva spirit" as "magic clothes" to deceive world public opinion, then it will inevitably stage an ugly scene of naked travel in full view of the public.

### 美国想穿上“魔衣”吗

    美国想穿上“魔衣”吗
    “虚伪是一个丑恶的字眼。但是要确当地形容西方国家政府对日内瓦外长会议的态度……虚伪实在是唯一的字眼。”这是美国专栏作家艾尔索普兄弟在十月二十四日“华盛顿邮报”上所写的话。
    艾尔索普兄弟认为，西方国家的虚伪在于它们的“政治家们在公开场合的发言和他们在一起时的谈论之间的差别从来没有像现在这样惊人的”。在公开的场合，他们装作“鼓励”“日内瓦精神”，而在私底下，他们却在举行一系列“忙忙碌碌的、几乎是热哄哄的”会议。据一位参与这些会议的人士说，会议的主题是研究在四国外长会议上“如何对我们（指西方国家）不能不预料的挫折装出最好看的面孔”。
    所谓“不能不预料的挫折”的说法，表明西方国家完全知道他们在外长会议上所采取的立场将给解决会议所面临的问题招致困难。
    艾尔索普兄弟指出：在欧洲安全和德国问题上，西方三国打算坚持它们明知行不通的方案，硬要苏联同意让德国的两部分“合并”，并且把这样“合并”以后的德国拉进北大西洋集团。艾尔索普兄弟说，这是因为“美英法三国决策者中有一大批而且数目在越来越多的人现在正为一种可怕的前景担心，那就是，在以后某一时候，……德国人将会决定放弃西方联盟来换取统一。”
    艾尔索普兄弟特别嘲笑了美国在裁军问题上的立场。艾尔索普兄弟说：美国决策者企图“使美国和全世界人士相信，只要首先能够拟订一项健全的视察制度，美国政府认为裁军将是容易的事。……但是，事实上，即使苏联同意一项严密的视察制度，裁军仍然不是容易的事。目前英法美三国还没有一项一致同意的裁军计划。甚至美国还没有一项一致同意的计划。”
    艾尔索普兄弟说，如果要美国提出任何认真的裁军计划，美国将“必须作出深刻的痛苦的国家的选择”，而美国对于这种选择“极其没有准备”。艾尔索普兄弟指出，美国整个军事计划目前是“围绕着核子武器拟订的”，而“任何名符其实的裁军计划当然必须包括禁止使用原子武器”。这却正是美国所最不愿意做的事情。
    因此，美国在裁军问题上的宣传完全是“虚张声势”。据艾尔索普兄弟说，英国外交部专家曾经告诫国务院说，如果这种“虚张声势”一旦被苏联揭穿，那末，由于西方国家“实际上并没有一项一致同意的裁军计划，那种受窘的样子不是容易掩盖的”。
    艾尔索普兄弟这种嘲笑，并不是由于对美国这种态度感到厌恶，而是由于他们认为美国不需要用任何伪装来否定“日内瓦精神”。艾尔索普兄弟把美国比作安徒生的童话“皇帝的新衣”中的愚蠢的国王，而把“日内瓦精神”比作国王所定做的魔衣。艾尔索普兄弟认为，“实际上根本没有衣裳”，也就是根本没有什么“日内瓦精神”，“但是由于据说这些衣裳是魔衣，因此无论国王和他的大臣们都不敢说他们看不见这些漂亮的衣裳。因此这位国王裸体出行，吹嘘说他的假想的衣裳是多么美丽。”
    但是，“日内瓦精神”并不是什么虚幻的“魔衣”。艾尔索普兄弟打的比喻只在这一点上是对的：如果美国在四国外长会议上背弃“日内瓦精神”，而还自以为能够用关于“日内瓦精神”的乐观空谈来作为欺骗世界舆论的“魔衣”，那它就真的免不了要在众目睽睽之下演出一幕裸体出行的丑剧。　　　（瑞）
