	Reactions to Criticism and Suggestions
	From the China Central-South Engineering Management Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering: The criticism in the "Letters from Readers" section on September 28 regarding our bureau and its affiliated units' lax financial system, which led to employees misappropriating public funds for extended periods, is accurate. In addition to instructing relevant personnel to conduct self-criticism, we will strictly enforce the borrowing system in the future.

	The "Letters from Readers" section on August 21 exposed the erroneous behavior of Wang Lan, the principal of the Bai Cheng County No. 1 Complete Elementary School in Jilin Province, who attempted to arrange a disguised form of arranged marriage for a young girl. The Education Section of the Bai Cheng County People's Committee has already taken action. Because Wang Lan has consistently failed to correctly recognize his mistake, the Culture and Education Section has given him a demotion.

	After the "Letters from Readers" section published an article entitled "How Long Will It Be Delayed?" on May 15, the Yi County People's Court immediately convened a meeting of all court cadres to conduct self-criticism regarding the error of prolonged delays in the trial of the counter-revolutionary Wang Jinxi case, and assigned a special person to be responsible for the trial. After more than a month of investigation and verification, Wang's counter-revolutionary crimes were fully confirmed. He has been sentenced to death, and after approval by the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court, a public trial was held on October 9 and the execution was carried out publicly.
