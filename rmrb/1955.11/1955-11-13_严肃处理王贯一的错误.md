To the Editors:

　　The People's Daily published a short essay entitled "In This 'Kingdom'" on May 12, criticizing the egregious behavior of Wang Guanyi, the principal of the No. 1 Normal School in Heze, Shandong. After seeing this criticism, Wang Guanyi not only failed to examine his own mistakes, but was filled with anger. He picked up a red pen and angrily crossed out lines upon lines of the essay criticizing him in the newspaper, claiming that these criticisms were inconsistent with the facts. Soon after, he unreasonably demanded that Deputy Secretary Hou of the Heze Prefectural Committee's directly affiliated Party Committee not say that the newspaper's criticism was entirely accurate at the school's Party branch meeting. Was the People's Daily's criticism of Wang Guanyi correct? It is enough to cite just one fact: After the publication of "In This 'Kingdom,'" the Heze Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China received more than 400 letters from the masses agreeing with the Party newspaper's criticism and continuing to expose Wang Guanyi's errors.

　　Wang Guanyi has consistently and shamelessly praised himself, and the situation is even more serious than what was revealed in "In This 'Kingdom.'" For example, the slogan at the Heze Normal School's affiliated primary school to encourage students to study hard was: "Strive for good grades to see Principal Wang!" In 1953, when Wang Guanyi met with elementary school students, he added "Good Discipline" to Chairman Mao's "Three Goods" instructions to young people, presenting it to the students as his own inscription; and he presumptuously said: "Adding this is essential for it to be complete for young students." Furthermore, every time students graduated, Wang Guanyi would hold a review, stipulating that when the formation passed the podium, the students' eyes should be fixed on the principal; then, he would speak to the students, repeatedly saying that "The school has nurtured you into adults, you must strengthen your 'alma mater concept,' maintain the school's reputation, and bring honor to your alma mater..." At one report meeting, he had someone read a letter from a graduate, which began: "Principal Wang, our father!..." Because he had such a fondness for "praise," a few students often flattered him, such as one student who said at a meeting: "When we think of Principal Wang, we are filled with strength."

　　In order to praise himself, Wang Guanyi formed a small clique. Over the years, teachers and staff who offered him opinions were transferred away one by one; and the teachers and staff he valued were mostly those who were good at flattery and had unclear political backgrounds or unfavorable family origins.

　　Wang Guanyi's so-called "achievements" or "experiences," which he constantly boasted about, were fabricated out of thin air by a research office he had privately established. For example, the school's "experience" in uniting and transforming intellectuals, which was praised by the Shandong Provincial Department of Culture and Education, was fabricated with no factual basis by simply modifying a newspaper article and submitting it as their own. In reality, besides "uniting" those who knew how to flatter and praise, he adopted a retaliatory attitude toward those who dared to uphold principles. For example, once a student raised some opinions to Wang Guanyi, Wang Guanyi said that the student had "bad intentions" and "wanted to bring down the school," so he launched a struggle against him through some students he controlled, ultimately driving him to a nervous breakdown. There are countless examples of this kind of suppression of criticism. Does this have anything in common with uniting and transforming intellectuals?

　　Wang Guanyi's mistakes have not been seriously dealt with for a long time. When he was suspended for self-criticism, he admitted to some mistakes; but after he resumed his work, he overturned the mistakes he had already admitted. Wang Guanyi's attitude has caused dissatisfaction among many people. They ask: It has been six months since the Party newspaper criticized Wang Guanyi. Why is there still no resolution?

### 严肃处理王贯一的错误

　　严肃处理王贯一的错误编辑同志：
    五月十二日人民日报发表了“在这个‘王国’里”的小品文，对山东菏泽第一师范学校校长王贯一的恶劣作风提出了批评。王贯一看到了这个批评，不但不检查自己的错误，反而怒气冲天。他拿起红笔，气狠狠地在报上批评他的那篇小品文上打上一行行的杠子，说是这些都同事实不符。不久，又无理地要求中共菏泽地委直属党委会侯副书记在学校党支部大会上不要说报纸的批评完全属实。人民日报对王贯一的批评是否正确呢？只要举出这样一件事实就够了：“在这个‘王国’里”这篇小品文发表以后，中共菏泽地委会就收到了四百多件同意党报批评和继续揭发王贯一的错误的群众来信。
    王贯一一贯无耻地吹捧自己，情况比“在这个‘王国’里”所揭发的还要严重。例如，菏泽师范的附属小学，鼓励学生努力学习的口号是：“争取成绩好，去见王校长！”一九五三年，王贯一接见了小学生，他把毛主席对青年的“三好”指示加上一条“纪律好”，当作自己的题词送给学生；并且狂妄地说：“要加上这一条，对青年学生来说才完整。”又如，每逢学生毕业的时候，王贯一就要举行一次检阅，规定在队伍通过主席台的时候，学生的目光都要看着校长；接着，他就向学生讲话，口口声声说是“学校把你们培养成人了，你们要加强‘母校观念’，保持校誉，要给母校增光……”。在一次报告会上，他让人宣读一个毕业生的来信，这封信的开头是：“王校长，我们的爸爸！……”由于他对“吹捧”有着这样的爱好，因此有少数学生也就经常奉承他，如一个学生在某次会议上讲话时，就说：“一想起王校长，我们就有了力量。”
    王贯一为了吹捧自己，就搞了一个小集团。几年来，对他提意见的教职员，都一个个被他调开了；而受他重用的教职员，多数是善于奉承而政治面貌不清、家庭出身不好的一些人。
    王贯一所不断吹嘘的自己的“成绩”或“经验”，都是由他私自设立的研究室凭空捏造出来的。例如，曾为山东省文教厅所表扬的这个学校对知识分子团结改造的“经验”，就是毫无事实根据而把报纸上的一篇文章改头换面写一下上报的。实际上，他除了“团结”了一些会拍会吹的人以外，对于敢于坚持原则的人都采取打击的态度。例如有一次一个学生向王贯一提出了一些意见，王贯一就说这个学生“存心不良”，“要搞垮这个学校”，就发动他所操纵的一部分学生斗争他，结果把他弄得神经失常。这种压制批评的例子是举不胜举的，难道这和对知识分子的团结改造有什么共同之点吗？
    王贯一的错误长期以来没有得到严肃的处理。当他停职反省的时候，他承认了一些错误；但是当恢复工作以后，又把已经承认的错误推翻了。王贯一的这种态度引起了许多人的不满。他们问：自从党报对王贯一提出批评到现在已经六个月了，为什么还没有处理结果？许
