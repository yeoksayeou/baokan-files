　　Negotiations Between Hungary and East Germany on the Release of German Citizens Concluded

    Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, November 12th: TASS, Budapest, November 11th: Negotiations between the government of the Hungarian People's Republic and the government of the German Democratic Republic regarding German citizens serving sentences in the Hungarian People's Republic for war crimes have concluded. The Press Department of the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communiqué on the matter, stating:

    The two sides have reached an agreement that the Hungarian government will order the release of these individuals and will no longer pursue the crimes they committed against the Hungarian people. The Hungarian government’s decision is based on the fact that these criminals have served the majority of their sentences, more than ten years have passed since the end of World War II, and the close friendship now established between the Hungarian People's Republic and the German Democratic Republic is a guarantee against renewed aggression by German militarists.

    The communiqué states that those who were sentenced for particularly serious crimes will be handed over to the state organs of the German Democratic Republic as war criminals, because the Hungarian People's Republic believes that these individuals cannot be released before their sentences expire.

　　关于释放犯有战争罪行的德国公民问题
　　匈牙利同民主德国政府间的谈判结束
    新华社十二日讯　塔斯社布达佩斯十一日讯：匈牙利人民共和国政府同德意志民主共和国政府之间关于因战争罪行而在匈牙利人民共和国服刑的德国公民的谈判已经结束，匈牙利外交部新闻司就此事发表公报说：
    谈判双方已达成协议，匈牙利政府将下令释放这些人，而不再追究他们对匈牙利人民所犯下的罪行。匈牙利政府采取这个决定的根据是，这批罪犯已服了大部分刑期，第二次世界大战结束已有十年多了，匈牙利人民共和国同德意志民主共和国之间现在所建立的密切友谊是避免德国军国主义者重新侵略的保障。
    公报说，那些因罪行特别严重而被判刑的人，将作为战犯移交给德意志民主共和国国家机关，因为匈牙利人民共和国认为，不能在刑期届满之前释放这些人。
