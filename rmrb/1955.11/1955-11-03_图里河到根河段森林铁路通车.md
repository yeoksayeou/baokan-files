    The newly constructed forest railway from Tuli River to Gen River in the Greater Khingan Range forest area of Inner Mongolia was officially opened to traffic on October 16th.
    Gen River is located in the hinterland of the right wing of the Greater Khingan Range, a virgin forest rarely visited by humans, and also the most concentrated area of ​​larch, the precious timber of the Sanhe Forest Area in the Greater Khingan Range. In the past, when Japanese invaders occupied Northeast China, they attempted to plunder the timber of the Sanhe Forest Area, but failed to build this forest railway due to too many difficulties. Now, in order to meet the needs of the country's large-scale economic construction and ensure the supply of timber, the workers have overcome many difficulties, passed through undulating mountain ranges and marshy areas, and completed this 50-kilometer-long forest railway in seven months.
    After the full opening of the Tugen section of the Yalin Line, the virgin forests on the Greater Khingan Range of Inner Mongolia are connected to major cities, factories, and mines across the country. In the future, large quantities of high-quality timber will be transported through this transportation artery to all parts of the country to support the country's basic construction.

    图里河到根河段森林铁路通车
    内蒙古大兴安岭林区新修筑成功的图里河至根河段森林铁路，已于十月十六日正式通车。
    根河位在大兴安岭右翼腹地，是一个人迹不到的原始森林，也是大兴安岭三河林区的名贵木材——落叶松最集中的地方。过去日寇侵占我国东北的时候，曾企图掠夺三河林区的木材，但是因为困难太多，这条森林铁路没有修筑成功。现在，工人们为了适应祖国大规模经济建设的需要，保证木材的供应，克服了许多困难，通过了峰峦起伏的山岭和泥沼地带，在七个月内便修通了这条长达五十公里的森林铁路。
    牙林线图根段全线正式通车以后，使内蒙古大兴安岭上的原始森林和全国各大城市、工厂、矿山都连接起来了。今后大批优良木材将通过这条运输的大动脉运送到全国各地去支援祖国的基本建设。
