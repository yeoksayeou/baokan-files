　　Large-Scale Wasteland Survey and Design Work Underway in Heilongjiang and Other Regions
    In order to adapt to the large-scale reclamation of wasteland and expansion of cultivated land in the future, Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and other sixteen provinces (regions) have systematically carried out wasteland survey and design work this year. As of October, the provinces (regions) have completed preliminary surveys of more than 29 million mu of wasteland, detailed surveys of more than 9.8 million mu, and designs for more than 3.2 million mu. It is expected that the wasteland survey and design tasks for this year will be fully completed by the end of the year.
    The wasteland that has been surveyed and designed in various places is mainly supplied for the construction of new state-owned farms and immigrant reclamation. Heilongjiang Province has surveyed more than 7.8 million mu of fertile wasteland for immigrants this year. Currently, it is carrying out planning and design work for more than 4 million mu of land for 166 new villages. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has completed wasteland surveys covering an area of ​​more than 12 million mu for military reclamation farms, of which more than 7.2 million mu is reclaimable wasteland. Hebei Province has completed planning and design work for more than 800,000 mu for the newly built State-owned Baigezhuang Mechanized Farm, Qinghexiguan Farm, and Guyuan Dachaidicao Beach State-owned Ranch.
    According to estimates by the Ministry of Agriculture, there are approximately 1.5 billion mu of wasteland in the country, which is equivalent to the area of ​​existing cultivated land in the country. This wasteland is mostly concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest, South China, Southwest, coastal areas, and other places. Due to the development of agricultural cooperativization and mechanization, there is more and more surplus labor, which provides basic conditions for large-scale wasteland reclamation and expansion of cultivated land area in the future. The state plans to reclaim more than 58 million mu of wasteland in the first five-year plan. From 1955 to 1957, the country will initially survey more than 130 million mu of reclaimable wasteland, conduct detailed surveys of more than 67 million mu, and design more than 57 million mu.
    In order to better complete the wasteland survey and design tasks stipulated by the state, sixteen provinces (regions) including Heilongjiang, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Xinjiang have established wasteland survey and design institutions this year, trained and cultivated more than 3,000 technical personnel in surveying, soil, water conservancy, and other fields. Furthermore, they have gained preliminary experience in wasteland survey and design work during this year's work, laying a solid foundation for larger-scale wasteland survey and design work in the future.

　　黑龙江等地大规模进行荒地勘测设计工作
    为了适应今后大规模的开垦荒地扩大耕地面积，今年黑龙江、广东、广西、甘肃、青海、四川、河北、山东、江苏、湖北、湖南、安徽、江西、云南、新疆维吾尔自治区、内蒙古自治区等十六省
  （区）有计划地进行了荒地勘测设计工作。到十月份止，各省（区）已完成荒地初查二千九百多万亩，详测九百八十多万亩，设计三百二十多万亩，预计到年底今年荒地勘测设计任务可全部完成。
    各地已经勘测设计的荒地主要是供给新建国营农场和移民开荒。黑龙江省今年已为移民勘测出七百八十多万亩肥沃荒地。目前正在为一百六十六个新建村庄四百多万亩土地进行规划设计工作。新疆维吾尔自治区已经为军垦农场完成荒地调查面积一千二百多万亩，其中可垦荒地有七百二十多万亩。河北省已为新建的国营柏各庄机耕农场，青河西灌农场及沽源大柴底草滩国营牧场作好了八十多万亩的规划设计工作。
    根据农业部的估计，全国有荒地十五亿亩左右，相当于全国现有耕地的面积。这些荒地多集中在东北、西北、华南、西南、沿海等地。由于农业合作化、机械化的发展，剩余劳动力越来越多，给今后大规模开垦荒地扩大耕地面积具备了基本条件。国家计划在第一个五年计划内开荒五千八百多万亩，从一九五五年到一九五七年，全国要初查可垦荒地一亿三千多万亩，详测六千七百多万亩，设计五千七百多万亩。
    为了更好地完成国家规定的荒地勘测设计任务，黑龙江、广东、广西、新疆等十六个省（区）今年都设立了荒地勘测设计机构，训练培养了测量、土壤、水利等技术人员三千多名，并且在今年的工作中取得了荒地勘测设计工作的初步经验，为今后更大规模的荒地勘测设计工作打下了巩固基础。
