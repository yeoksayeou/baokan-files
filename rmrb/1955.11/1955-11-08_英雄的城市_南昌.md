    Heroic City - Nanchang
    By our correspondent Sun Zunian

    Nanchang is located in the north of Jiangxi Province, on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Gan River. It is the political, economic, and cultural center of Jiangxi Province, with convenient land and water transportation. It is the intersection of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway. Highways and waterways connect to various large, medium, and small cities within the province.

    Nanchang has a long revolutionary history. On August 1, 1927, under the leadership of Comrades Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Ye Ting, He Long, and others, an armed force of more than 30,000 people held the famous "August 1st" Uprising here. Now, Nanchang has become a place familiar to and longed for by the people and is praised as a "heroic city."

    I visited this glorious city with admiration. Walking along Zhanqian Road from the Nanchang Railway Station, both sides are newly built buildings. In the southwest corner is a new workers' village with an area of more than 10,000 square meters and more than 600 rooms. The intersection of Zhanqian Road and "August 1st" Avenue is "August 1st" Square, which will also be the center of the new urban area in the future. In the center of the square stands a huge revolutionary martyrs' memorial hall, displaying the great achievements of the people of Jiangxi in revolutionary struggles over the past few decades. Next to it is a newly built large-scale workers' cultural palace. To the west of "August 1st" Avenue, close to the Gan River, and east of the railway, surrounding the Ai Creek, Qingshan, and Xianshi three lakes, is the new industrial area, where the newly built Jiangxi Paper Mill, Jiangxi Textile Mill, etc. are located. The more than 3,000 employees of the Jiangxi Textile Mill are mostly children of military personnel and revolutionary martyrs from old revolutionary base areas in the province.

    Before liberation, Nanchang was a backward consumer city with very little industry. There were only two or three factories engaged in processing, and production often stagnated. Now, the city has 86 large and small machine-producing factories. Many products that could not be manufactured in the past, such as mechanical equipment, knitwear, cotton cloth, Western medicine, newsprint, etc., can now be produced in large quantities. The Nanchang Diesel Engine Factory used to be a factory repairing auto parts, but now it can produce water pumps, diesel engines, and cotton combers. At present, the main industrial products that the city can produce include cotton cloth, paper, diesel engines, motors, cigarettes, flour, matches, electricity, bricks, tiles, soap, vegetable oil, cotton yarn, cement pipes, nails, etc. Last year, the city's total industrial output value increased by 267.47 percent compared to 1950. This year, the planned total industrial output value will increase by another 24 percent compared to last year. With the development of production, the ranks of workers are also growing stronger. By the end of last year, the number of employees in the city's industrial sector had increased by 83 percent compared to 1950.

    With the growth of industrial production, cultural, educational, health, and municipal construction have also developed accordingly in recent years. At present, the city has four universities, three secondary technical schools, thirteen middle schools and normal schools, and ninety-five primary schools, an increase of 246 percent compared to the early days of liberation. In terms of workers' and peasants' spare-time education, the number of participants has reached more than 6 percent of the city's population. The number of health and medical institutions in the city has increased by 63 compared to the early days of liberation. A new two-story building, Jiangxi Province's first new-type Chinese medicine experimental institute, has been built on the east side of "August 1st" Avenue, and next to it is the newly built first children's hospital. The provincial workers' sanatorium newly built on the shore of Qingshan Lake is fully equipped with X-ray machines, electrotherapy, phototherapy, paraffin therapy, etc.

    In the past six years, the city has newly built and rebuilt eleven roads; newly laid 19,659 meters of sewer pipes; and installed 155,178 meters of tap water pipes. The newly built Ruzi Road sewer has solved the problem of water accumulation in the rainy season in an area of 2,000 mu, improving the environmental sanitation of more than 2,000 households in this area. The once dilapidated Fudayou Embankment has also changed its original appearance and, like a barrier, protects industrial production and the safety of the lives and property of the people of the city.

    Walking west from "August 1st" Avenue is the scenic area, where there is "August 1st" Park, as well as the vast East and West Lakes. A pavilion has been built on each of the lake's Heart Island and Gongpu Island, and the original Guan'ao Pavilion has also been repainted and repaired. Saplings and various flowers and plants have been planted next to the pavilion, completely changing the past situation of foul water and truly becoming a place for the working people to relax. In order to expand the tourist area for the working people, a new park with an area of about 400 mu has been opened to the east of "August 1st" Avenue, which is equivalent to eight times the size of the current "August 1st" Park.

    West from "August 1st" Park is the old urban area, with a tidy and prosperous market. In order to meet the needs of economic construction and development, the state has decided to rebuild the one-kilometer-long "August 1st" Bridge across the Gan River, connecting Nanchang and the northwestern region of Jiangxi, with reinforced concrete.

    Nanchang – is developing rapidly with each passing day. In the great socialist construction of the motherland, Nanchang – this famous revolutionary city, will forever maintain its glory. (Attached photo)

    英雄的城市——南昌
    本报记者　孙祖年
    南昌位于江西省北部，赣江下游南岸，是江西省政治、经济、文化的中心，水陆交通便利，为浙赣铁路和南浔铁路的交点，公路和水路可通省内各中小城市。
    南昌有悠久的革命历史，一九二七年八月一日，在周恩来、朱德、叶挺、贺龙等同志领导下，组成的一支三万多人的武装部队，在这里举行了有名的“八一”起义。现在，南昌已成为人们所熟悉和向往的地方，并被誉为“英雄的城市”。
    我怀着敬仰的心情，访问了这个光荣城市。沿着南火车站的站前路往前走，两旁都是新建的楼房，西南角上是一座有一万多平方公尺面积、六百多个房间的工人新村。站前路和“八一”大道交叉中心，是“八一”广场，也是将来新市区的中心。在广场的中央，矗立着一座巨大的革命烈士纪念堂，陈列着江西人民几十年来在革命斗争中的丰功伟绩。旁边还有一座新建的规模宏大的工人文化宫。在“八一”大道以西，靠近赣江，铁路以东，环绕着艾溪、青山、贤士三湖的周围，是新的工业区，这里有新建的江西造纸厂、江西纺织厂等。江西纺织厂的三千多个职工，绝大部分是省内老革命根据地的军、烈属子女。
    解放前，南昌是一个落后的消费城市，工业少得可怜，只有两三家属于加工性质的工厂，而且生产常常停顿。现在，全市有大、小机器生产的工厂八十六个，过去许多不能制造的产品，如机械设备、针织品、棉布、西药、新闻纸等，现在都能大量生产。南昌柴油机厂过去是一家修配汽车零件的工厂，现在已经能生产抽水机、柴油机和梳棉机了。目前全市能出产的主要工业品有棉布、纸张、柴油机、电机、卷烟、面粉、火柴、电力、砖瓦、肥皂、植物油、棉纱、水泥管、钉等。去年一年全市工业总产值较一九五○年增加了百分之二百六十七点四七。今年计划工业总产值较去年再增长百分之二十四。随着生产的发展，工人队伍也日愈壮大，到去年年底全市工业方面的职工人数较一九五○年增加了百分之八十三。
    随着工业生产的增长，几年来文化、教育、卫生事业和市政建设也相应地获得发展。现全市有高等学校四所，中等技术学校三所，中学、师范学校十三所，小学九十五所，较解放初期增加了百分之二百四十六。在工农业余教育方面，参加学习的人数达全市人口百分之六以上。全市卫生医疗机构较解放初期增加六十三所。在“八一”大道东侧新建筑了一幢二层楼的江西省第一所新型的中医实验所，在它的旁边还有新建的第一所儿童医院。青山湖畔新建的省工人疗养院，有爱克斯光机、电疗、光疗、腊疗等，设备很齐全。
    六年来，全市新建和改建了十一条马路；新铺下水道管一万九千六百五十九公尺；安装了自来水管十五万五千一百七十八公尺。新修建的孺子路下水道，解决了二千亩地区的雨季积水问题，使这个区域内的两千多户市民的环境卫生得到改善。过去千孔百疮的富大有堤，也改变了原来的面貌，像屏障一样保障了工业生产和全市人民生命财产的安全。
    从“八一”大道向西走，就是风景区，这里有“八一”公园，还有广阔的东、西湖，在湖心岛和公圃岛上各建了一所凉亭，原来的冠鳌亭也重新油漆修理过，亭旁栽植了树苗和各种花草，已完全改变了过去臭水逼人的情景，真正成为劳动人民的游憩地方。为了扩大劳动人民游览区，在“八一”大道以东又新辟了一个面积约四百市亩的公园，相当于现在“八一”公园的八倍。
    由“八一”公园往西，就是老市区，市面整齐繁荣。为了适应经济建设发展的需要，国家决定用钢筋混凝土改建横跨赣江两岸、联系南昌和赣西北地区的长一公里的“八一”大桥。
    南昌——正在日新月异地发展。在祖国伟大的社会主义建设中，南昌——这座革命的名城，将永远保持它的光荣。（附图片）
