Xinhua News Agency, October 31st: The Beijing Municipal People's Committee held its eighth meeting on the 31st and discussed and approved the "Implementation Rules of the Beijing Municipal Provisional Measures for Grain Rationing in Towns and Cities," deciding to implement it citywide starting November 1st.

Before implementing grain rationing, the Beijing Municipal People's Committee carried out preparations in all aspects. The results of the trial implementation of grain rationing in the Dongdan and Shijingshan districts in September proved that the amount of resident grain rations stipulated by the State Council meets the actual needs of the vast majority of people. The Municipal People's Committee decided that if the grain supply for a small number of people is slightly insufficient, in addition to allowing residents to adjust it themselves, the street offices will also organize appropriate adjustments. Agencies, factories, mines, enterprises, and schools will organize adjustments within their units. If some units still cannot resolve the issue after adjustments, the grain departments will uniformly adjust and resolve it.

Xinhua News Agency, October 30th: The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions convened a meeting on the afternoon of the 29th, gathering canteen managers from nearly 200 large factories, mines, enterprises, agencies, and schools in the city to exchange experiences in saving grain in canteens.

At the meeting, the managers of the No. 4 Canteen of the Beijing Railway Administration introduced the "wooden bucket rice steaming method," which particularly attracted everyone's attention. By using this method, the canteen not only saved grain but also saved nearly half the coal compared to the past every day. At the meeting, many other units also introduced their experiences in saving grain.

In the grain conservation campaign, hundreds of canteens in Beijing have implemented strict planned management systems, greatly reducing and avoiding grain waste, and the amount of grain used has generally decreased. According to statistics from the canteens of six factories and mines, including Shijingshan Power Plant, Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory, and Beijing Knitting Factory, the average grain consumption per person decreased by two catties in August compared to June.

    北京市从今天起全面实行粮食定量供应
    新华社三十一日讯　北京市人民委员会三十一日举行第八次会议，讨论通过了北京市关于“市镇粮食定量供应暂行办法”的实施细则，决定十一月一日起在全市推行。
    北京市人民委员会在实行粮食定量供应前，进行了各方面的准备工作。九月份在东单和石景山两个区试行粮食定量供应的结果证明：国务院规定的居民口粮定量数量是符合绝大多数人的实际需要的。市人民委员会决定：如果少数人的粮食供应量稍有不足，除允许居民自行调剂外，街道办事处也将组织适当的调剂。机关、厂矿、企业、学校由本单位组织调剂，如果有些单位经过调剂仍不能解决时，就由粮食部门统一调剂解决。
    新华社三十日讯　北京市工会联合会在二十九日下午召集全市近二百个较大厂矿、企业、机关和学校的食堂管理人员开会，交流食堂节约粮食的经验。
    会上，北京铁路管理局第四食堂的管理人员介绍了“木桶蒸饭法”，特别引起大家的注意。这个食堂采用这个方法，不但节约了粮食，每天还能比过去节省近一半的煤炭。在会上，其他许多单位也介绍了他们节约粮食的经验。
    北京市几百个单位的食堂在节约粮食运动中，都实行了严格的计划管理制度，大大减少和避免了粮食浪费现象，用粮量普遍下降。据石景山发电厂、北京市制药厂、北京市针织厂等六个厂矿的食堂统计，八月份比六月份每人平均用粮减少了二斤。
