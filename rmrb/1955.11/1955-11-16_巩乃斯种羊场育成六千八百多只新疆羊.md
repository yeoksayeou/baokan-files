　　The Gongnaisi State-owned Stud Farm in Xinjiang has bred more than 6,800 Xinjiang sheep this year according to the state plan, an increase of approximately 70% over last year's output. After another year of breeding, the vast majority of the rams among these newborn lambs will be promoted to various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and other important pastoral areas across the country.

　　In the past year, the Gongnaisi Stud Farm has improved the grazing management methods for sheep, ensured the supply of feed, eliminated the scabies that have plagued the flock for years, and timely overcame natural disasters such as strong wind and snowstorms, protecting the safety of the flock. This year, the quality of Xinjiang sheep has been further significantly improved: the average wool yield per sheep is 3.48 kilograms, an increase of 0.31 kilograms compared to last year; the average weight of adult rams has increased from 70.6 kilograms last year to 83.6 kilograms, with the highest reaching 94 kilograms.

　　巩乃斯种羊场育成六千八百多只新疆羊
    新疆地方国营巩乃斯种羊场今年按照国家计划育成了六千八百多只新疆羊，比去年育成数增加了百分之七十左右。这些新生羊羔中的公羊，再经过一年的培育过程，绝大部分将推广给新疆维吾尔自治区各地和全国其他重要的畜牧业地区。
    巩乃斯种羊场在过去一年中改进了羊只的牧放管理方法，保证了饲料供应，消灭了连年危害羊群的疥癣，并及时战胜了大风雪等自然灾害，保护了羊群的安全。今年新疆羊的质量进一步有了显著提高：平均每只羊剪毛三点四八公斤，比去年增加了零点三一公斤；大公羊的平均体重由去年的七十点六公斤上升到八十三点六公斤，最高的达到了九十四公斤。　（本报集体通讯员新疆日报编辑部）
