　　Ideological Mobilization Must Be Done Well During Cooperative Construction
　　Coercive Orders Arouse Farmers' Dissatisfaction Editor:
    In the recent two months, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives in Luoning County, Henan Province, has increased from 180 to 461 (member households account for 32% of the total number of households). Additionally, 644 cooperative frameworks have been set up, and permanent mutual aid teams have also developed to 1,497. In most areas, in-depth ideological mobilization work has been carried out during the cooperative construction process, achieving voluntary mutual benefit and implementing the class policy.
    However, in individual places, there has also been a tendency towards coercive orders. For example, Yang Xiangshen, a member of the Communist Youth League in Shanghe Village, Hongya Township, Seventh District, announced at a mass meeting: "Those who are willing to take the socialist road should sign up to join the cooperative and stand on the east side; those who are willing to take the capitalist road should adhere to individual farming and stand on the west side." He also wanted to keep those who had not yet decided to join the cooperative in the meeting until dawn. This approach aroused dissatisfaction among the peasant masses. Some peasants said: "Chairman Mao has pointed out a good path for us. If we talk to the farmers properly, who wouldn't be willing to take it? The cadres don't reason with us and insist on coercive orders, which is really strange!" Zhang Fenlong (a Party member), the head of Chengcun Township, Second District, convened a mass meeting in Liujiagou attended by 78 peasant households, calling on everyone to join the cooperative. Sixty-four households signed up on the spot. Zhang Fenlong wanted all 78 households to join the cooperative at once, so he was very dissatisfied and ordered the 14 peasant households who had not signed up to go outside to hold a discussion, and instructed Deputy Township Head Lü Guisheng to forcibly organize them into groups. The peasants Liu Shinian, Wu Goumao, and others, who had not signed up to join the cooperative, said helplessly: "Township Head, there's no need to organize us. Let's all apply to join the cooperative!" Chengguan Town, First District, also used the method of having individual farmers meet with controlled elements to force peasants to join the cooperative. Zhang Dianwen, a cadre in Shangying Village, Xiaying Township, Second District, forcibly organized eight peasant households who did not sign up to join the cooperative at a mass meeting into a mutual aid team, and said that the township would have this team deliver all the letters in the future. Poor peasant Wang Dongzi said: "Joining the cooperative is a good thing, but my wife hasn't figured it out yet, so I didn't sign up at the time. The cadres forcibly organized our eight households into a mutual aid team. Some households are at the east end of the village, and some are at the west end. It's inconvenient to work together, and the township wants us to deliver letters. How can we do a good job in production?"
    Although this phenomenon is isolated, the CPC Luoning County Committee has discovered and corrected it. However, in the face of the current high tide of the cooperative movement, we must maintain a clear head, actively carry out ideological education work to mobilize peasants to join the cooperative, and resolutely prevent any coercive orders. This is worthy of universal attention in all regions.　Qu Zongyan
　　Impatience and Rashness Lead Work Astray Editor:
    The Party branch of Nanhao Village, Nanhao Township, Baixiang County, Hebei Province, mistakenly believed that since the high tide of cooperativization had arrived, there was no need to do any arduous and meticulous ideological mobilization work and specific organizational work in cooperative construction. Therefore, they adopted simple and crude methods. As a result, the cooperative construction work took a detour and had to be started all over again.
    When this village started building the cooperative, it simply conducted an ideological ranking of the peasants who had not yet joined the cooperative within the Party and identified 25 mobilization targets. Then, it convened a mass meeting calling on people to sign up to join the cooperative. Because no ideological education work was carried out, only 15 households signed up to join the cooperative. Some Party member cadres said impatiently: "It's no good unless we do it by force!" The Party branch did not examine its own work. Instead, it drew up another plan, deciding to hold meetings for five consecutive nights. However, these meetings not only failed to achieve results, but also made the peasants who had originally planned to join the cooperative have concerns and become unwilling to sign up. Party member cadres pursued ideological issues from household to household at the discussion meetings. The more tightly they pursued them, the greater the peasants' ideological concerns became, and a "standoff" situation formed.
    After the township general branch discovered this situation, it led the Nanhao Village branch to examine and summarize the previous stage of work in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, identified the main reasons for the failure of the work, and then made an overall plan for the cooperative movement work in the village, conducting class ranking and ideological ranking of the peasants who had not yet joined the cooperative on a household-by-household basis and selecting nine backbone households for cultivation. In addition, the village branch summarized the advantages of the original agricultural producers' cooperative in the village, widely publicized them to the peasants, and publicly reviewed the errors of the previous stage of cooperative construction work, specifically explaining the voluntary mutual benefit policy. This eliminated the peasants' ideological concerns. Now, through individual contacts by Party members, Youth League members, and activists, this village has formed two small cooperatives, expanded two old cooperatives, and developed 52 new cooperative members in total.
    Ideological mobilization work must be done well in cooperative construction. Simple and crude methods will only make things worse. The lesson of the detour taken by cooperative construction in Nanhao Village is worthy of attention.　Xing Zhi

### 在建社中必须做好思想发动工作

　　在建社中必须做好思想发动工作
　　强迫命令引起农民不满编辑同志：
    河南省洛宁县最近两个多月来农业生产合作社已经由原来的一百八十个发展到四百六十一个
  （入社农户占总农户的百分之三十二），还搭起了六百四十四个社架子，常年互助组也发展为一千四百九十七个。绝大部分地区在建社工作中都进行了深入的思想发动工作，做到了自愿互利，贯彻执行了阶级政策。
    但是，在个别地方，也出现了强迫命令的偏向。例如，七区洪崖乡上河村团员杨相申在群众大会宣布：“谁愿意走社会主义道路，要报名参加合作社，站在东边；谁愿意走资本主义道路，要坚持单干，站在西边。”并且想要让还没有下决心入社的人一直开会到天明。这种做法引起了农民群众的不满。有的农民就说：“毛主席给咱指出一条好路。好好对农民说说，谁还能不愿意走。干部们不讲道理，偏要强迫命令，真叫人奇怪！”二区城村乡乡长张分龙（党员）在刘家沟召开了一个有七十八户农民参加的群众会，号召大家入社。当场有六十四户报了名。张分龙却想叫七十八户一下子都入社，因此就很不满意地命令没有报名入社的十四户农民到屋子外面去开讨论会，并且指示副乡长吕贵升把他们强迫编组。没有报名入社的农民刘石碾、吴狗毛等无可奈何地说：
  “乡长，不用编啦，我们都申请入社吧！”一区城关镇还用让单干户同被管制分子一起开会的办法来强迫农民入社。二区下营乡上营村干部张殿文在一个群众会上把八户没有当时报名入社的农民硬编成一个互助组，并且说以后乡里有信都要让这个组去送。贫农王东子说：“入社是好事，但是我女人还没有想开，因此我当时没有报名。干部硬把我们八户编到一块成立互助组，有的户在东头，有的户在西头，做活不方便，乡里还要叫送信，叫我们怎样搞好生产呢？”
    这种现象虽然是个别的，中共洛宁县委发现以后，也已经进行了纠正。但是，在目前合作化运动的高潮前面，我们必须保持清醒的头脑，积极做好思想教育工作，来发动农民入社，坚决防止任何强迫命令的做法，这是值得引起各地普遍注意的。　曲宗彦
　  急躁蛮干使工作走了弯路编辑同志：
    河北省柏乡县南郝乡南郝村党支部错误地认为：反正合作化高潮到来了，建社工作中就不需要做什么艰苦细致的思想发动工作和具体组织工作了，因此采取了简单、粗糙的办法。结果，就使建社工作走了弯路，不得不从头另做。
    这个村开始建社的时候，只是在党内简单地将还没有入社的农民进行了一下思想排队，找出了二十五户动员对象；接着就召开群众大会号召报名入社。由于没有进行思想教育工作，结果只有十五户报名入社。有些党员干部就急躁地说：“非硬干不行！”党支部也不检查自己的工作，反而又订了个计划，决定一连开五晚上的会。可是，这些会议不但没有成绩，反而使原来打算入社的农民也有了顾虑，不愿意报名了。党员干部就在讨论会上逐户追思想。追得越紧，农民的思想顾虑越大，就形成了“顶牛”的局面。
    乡总支发现了这个情况以后，就领导南郝村支部用批评和自我批评的精神检查和总结了上一段的工作，找出了工作失败的主要原因，接着对村里的合作化运动工作作了全面规划，将还没有入社的农民逐户进行了阶级排队和思想排队，挑选出九户骨干进行培养。另外，村支部又总结了本村原有农业生产合作社的优越性，广泛向农民宣传，并且公开检讨了前一阶段建社工作的错误，具体讲解了自愿互利政策。这样，才解除了农民的思想顾虑。现在，这个村通过党团员和积极分子的个别串连，已经组成了两个小社，扩大了两个老社，共发展新社员五十二户。
    建社工作中必须做好思想发动工作，简单粗糙的办法只会把事情办坏。南郝村建社走弯路的教训是值得重视的。　邢支
