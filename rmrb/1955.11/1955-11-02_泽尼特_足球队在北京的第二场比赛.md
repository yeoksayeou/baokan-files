    The Second Game of the "Zenit" Football Team in Beijing
    Li Ping
    The Soviet Leningrad "Zenit" football team played a friendly match with the Chinese Youth Team in Beijing on the afternoon of November 1st, resulting in a 3-2 victory for the "Zenit" team.
    The "Zenit" team played brilliantly yesterday, with all the athletes displaying their athletic skills, and being rigorous in both offense and defense. The spirit they showed on the field, of not fearing any difficulties and actively striving for victory, and the excellent moral character of taking meticulous care of our athletes, were once again widely praised.
    The Chinese Youth Football Team is a young and strong football team in our country. They recently returned from a visit abroad, and their skills and tactics have improved to a certain extent. During their visits to Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic, they won many victories. Yesterday, they also played very successfully in the match against the "Zenit" team. Goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu performed particularly well, and many of the "Zenit" team's urgent shots were skillfully saved by him. This evenly matched and intense game attracted more than 20,000 spectators, and the atmosphere in the stands was always high-spirited and exciting.
    After the start of the match, our Youth Team used quick short passes to attack. Although the "Zenit" team was temporarily on the defensive, their superior running speed and ball interception skills immediately became apparent. The four forwards of the Youth Team were skilled in cross-switching positions. Only three minutes after the start of the game, they got a chance to shoot. Center forward Zhang Honggen faked out "Zenit" team's center back Samarin and made the first long shot, which missed. The ball was sent to the midfield, and a fierce interception battle unfolded. Relying on excellent conditions such as fast starts, high dribbling speed, and close cooperation, the "Zenit" team began to press the ball into the Youth Team's defense zone. They adopted offensive tactics of pushing along the sidelines, crossing from the goal line, and surrounding in a horseshoe shape, approaching the Youth Team's goal. "Zenit" team's right winger Ivanov advanced with the ball very quickly, making it impossible for the opponent's defenders to block him. After about ten minutes, "Zenit" team's left winger Denisov wedged into the penalty area, left inside forward Bondarenko switched to the left wing position with the ball, and crossed from near the goal line, landing right at Denisov's feet. Denisov kicked the ball and shot, but it was blocked by Youth Team's center back Xie Hongjun. The ball landed in front of the right inside forward Tieniagin, ten meters from the goal. Tieniagin saw accurately and kicked the ball hard into the net.
    After losing a point, the Youth Team counterattacked with all their strength. Midfielder Nian Weisi supplied the ball accurately, and right winger Cong Zheyu dribbled past opponent's midfielder Mazeppov and defender Khudorozh straight towards the goal. Left inside forward Fang Renqiu switched to the right inside forward position and quickly followed up. Cong Zheyu drew out goalkeeper Lie Ivanov and immediately passed the ball to Fang Renqiu for a shot. Fang Renqiu's shot was not at the right angle and went wide. The audience in the stands sighed in unison because this seemingly sure goal had not been scored. Twenty-seven minutes after the start of the game, Youth Team's Cong Zheyu once again dribbled into the penalty area, but was kicked out of the goal line by Galtevig. Cong kicked a corner kick straight to the right side of the "Zenit" team's goal. Youth Team's left winger Wang Lu made a powerful shot. Goalkeeper Lie Ivanov fell to the ground to save the ball, and the ball slipped from his hands. Fang Renqiu made another shot, but was caught by Lie Ivanov. The Youth Team lost another scoring opportunity.
    After many fierce attacks yielded no results, the "Zenit" team stepped up their offensive. Center forward Kravitz advanced along the left sideline, and the other four wings all pressed towards the Youth Team's penalty area. Ivanov got the ball twenty meters to the right of the goal, and seeing a gap in the goal, immediately made a hard long shot. The ball was as fast as an arrow, but Youth Team's goalkeeper Zhang Junxiu had already positioned himself, and he jumped up and caught the ball in his chest. Just two minutes later, Denisov dribbled the ball along the sideline to near the goal line and crossed it in the middle. Ivanov had already wedged in. Youth Team defender Pu Wanfu was about to turn around to block, but Denisov had already shot the ball into the goal. Two to zero, the "Zenit" team's momentum was greatly enhanced.
    Four minutes before the end of the first half, Zhang Honggen and Fang Renqiu performed a wonderful collaboration: first, Zhang dribbled the ball past three defenders and approached the shot, Lie Ivanov punched it out, Zhang Honggen took advantage of the situation and flashed in, absorbing Samarin, Khudorozh was about to supplement it, Fang Renqiu swept a kick and put the ball into the bottom of the net.
    After the continuation of the game, the "Zenit" team's offense was still very fierce, and the Youth Team also fought bravely. "Zenit" team's Bondarenko sent the ball from the left to the front of the goal, Denisov passed it horizontally to Kravitz, who had squeezed into the penalty area, Zhang Junxiu was about to save it, but Kravitz had already lightly dialed the ball into the net with the inside edge of his right foot. Although the Youth Team lost two points, they still tried their best to reverse the defeat. The cross-switching of their four forwards was more active than before. In the effort to force in, they got a chance to take a corner kick, Zhang Honggen lived up to expectations, and in the melee he shot a goal very crisply. After the record was pulled to three to two, the Youth Team's spirit of attacking strongly increased greatly, but the "Zenit" team was physically strong, and they defended the opponent's blitz with close man-to-man marking. Khudorozh's agility and bravery won a lot of applause. "Zenit" team's many fierce shots were also saved by Zhang Junxiu. The record of three to two was maintained until the end of the game.

    “泽尼特”足球队在北京的第二场比赛
    李平
    苏联列宁格勒“泽尼特”足球队十一月一日下午在北京同中国青年队作友谊比赛，结果三比二，“泽尼特”队获胜。
    “泽尼特”队昨天打得很精彩，所有运动员都发挥了他们的运动技能，无论攻守都很严谨。他们在运动场上表现出的不畏任何困难，积极争取胜利的精神，和无微不至地爱护我国运动员的优良道德作风，再次受到人们的普遍赞扬。
    中国青年足球队是我国一支年轻力强的足球队，他们不久前才从国外访问归来，技术和战术都有一定进步，在访问匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国期间，曾获多次胜利。昨天在迎战“泽尼特”队时，他们打得也很成功。守门员张俊秀表演得尤其出色，“泽尼特”队许多次急射都被他机敏地扑救住了。这场势均力敌的激烈比赛吸引了两万多观众，看台上的情绪始终是昂奋、激动的。
    球赛开始后，我国青年队运用快速短传进攻。“泽尼特”队虽暂处防御地位，但奔跑速度和截球技术的优越立即显现出来。青年队四前锋交叉换位比较熟练，开赛不过三分钟即获得射门机会，中锋张宏根晃过“泽尼特”队中卫萨马林作第一次远射不中。球被送到中场，猛烈的截夺战展开了。“泽尼特”队凭起动快、带球速度高和合作紧密等优良条件，开始把球压进青年队防区。他们采用边线推进、底线传中和马蹄形包围的进攻战术，逼近青年队大门。“泽尼特”队右翼伊凡诺夫带球推进非常神速，使对方后卫无法阻拦。十分钟左右，“泽尼特”队左翼杰尼索夫楔入禁区，左内锋邦达连科带球换位到左翼位置，在逼近底线处一脚传中，正好落在杰尼索夫脚下，杰尼索夫踢球射门，被青年队中卫谢鸿钧挡出，球落在门前十公尺的右内锋捷尼亚根面前，捷尼亚根看得准确，硬脚踢球进网。
    先失一分后，青年队全力反击，前卫年维泗供球准确，右翼丛者余带球转过对方前卫马泽波夫和后卫胡多罗什直扑大门，左内锋方纫秋换到右内锋位置迅速跟进，丛者余引出守门员列·伊凡诺夫，并立时把球拨送给方纫秋攻门。方纫秋射门角度不正，一脚偏出。看台观众对这个势在必入的空门球也没攻进齐声叹惜。开赛后二十七分钟，青年队丛者余再度带球闪进禁区，却被加尔特维格踢出底线。丛开角球直落“泽尼特”队大门右侧，青年队左翼王陆一脚劲射，守门员列·伊凡诺夫应声扑救跌倒，球从他手中滑出，方纫秋再补一脚正被列·伊凡诺夫抱住。青年球队又失去一次得分机会。
    经过多次猛攻皆无所获，“泽尼特”队攻势加紧。中锋克拉维茨沿左边线推进，其余四个锋翼齐向青年队禁区进逼。伊凡诺夫在大门右侧二十公尺得球，见大门露出空挡，立即硬脚远射，球出脚后，急如飞箭，但是青年队守门员张俊秀早已站好位置，他奋身一跳即将来球抱在胸前。不过两分钟，杰尼索夫又沿边线带球到近底线处中传，伊凡诺夫早已楔入，青年队后卫朴万福正想转身拦阻，杰尼索夫已射球进门。二比零，“泽尼特”队声势大振。
    前半时终场前四分钟，张宏根和方纫秋表演了一次美妙的合作：先是张带球连过三个后卫逼近射门，列·伊凡诺夫一拳打出，张宏根趁势闪进。吸住萨马林，胡多罗什刚要补进，方纫秋横扫一脚，把球拨进网底。
    继续比赛后，“泽尼特”队攻势仍极猛烈，青年队也奋勇作战。“泽尼特”队邦达连科从左方把球遥送门前，杰尼索夫横传给已挤进禁区的克拉维茨，张俊秀正要扑救，克拉维茨已用右脚内沿把球轻拨入网。青年队虽然输了两分，仍竭力争取挽回败局，他们四前锋的交叉换位较前活跃，在奋力逼进中，他们获得一次发角球的机会，张宏根不负众望，在混战中极清脆地射进一球。记录拉成三比二以后，青年队攻坚锐气大大增长，但是“泽尼特”队体力强壮，他们以紧逼人盯人防御着对方的闪击，胡多罗什的敏捷和勇敢获得不少彩声。“泽尼特”队多次猛射也被张俊秀扑救出险。三比二的记录一直保持到终场。
