　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, November 4th: According to a Kyodo News Agency report from Tokyo on the 4th, the Japanese government, using violence, forcibly sent approximately 120 Chinese nationals detained at the Hamamatsu "Detention Center" in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, to Taiwan on November 4th.

　　Kyodo News Agency reported that around 0:15 AM on the 4th, the Japanese government attempted to "forcibly repatriate to Taiwan" the 120 Chinese detained at the Hamamatsu "Detention Center." At this time, "six of them refused forced repatriation. Therefore, the security officers used force to try to drag them out. Then, the approximately one hundred detainees remaining there helped the six to cause a disturbance. Consequently, the 'Detention Center' requested the Hamamatsu City Kita Ward Police Station to send 100 police officers to suppress the situation, resulting in a brawl lasting about 30 minutes... Five people from the 'Detention Center' suffered serious and minor injuries."

　　The Kyodo News Agency report also stated that, disregarding their opposition, "the six who refused repatriation were still put on a train leaving Hamamatsu at 7:26 AM this morning (the 4th) and sent to Kobe, the location for boarding the ship."

    日本政府竟强制把一百多名华侨送往台湾
    新华社四日讯　据共同社东京四日电报道，日本政府竟施用暴力，在十一月四日把被拘禁在日本静冈县滨松‘收容所’的约一百二十个中国侨民强制送往台湾。
    共同社的消息说，在四日清晨零时十五分前后，日本政府方面企图把拘禁在滨松“收容所”的一百二十名中国人“强制送回台湾”。这时，“其中有六个人拒绝强制送回，因此，警备官就用武力想把他们拉出来，当时，剩留在那里的约计一百个被收容者帮助这六个人大闹起来。于是，“收容所”方面要求滨松市北区警察署派来警察一百名，想要加以镇压，因而发生了约计三十分钟的混斗。……‘收容所’方面五人受了重伤和轻伤。”
    共同社消息还说，不顾他们的反对，“拒绝送回的六个人还是在今晨（四日）七点二十六分被送上由滨松开出的列车，送到搭船地点神户去了。”
