　　Cotton Bumper Harvest in Cixi County
　　Tang Wusheng
    Cixi County, located on the southeastern coast of the motherland, is a large plain of over 500,000 mu. It is a county with high cotton yields in our country, and this year it has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The county's average yield reached more than 73 jin per mu, more than double that of the early days after liberation. This year, the county produced more than 350,000 dan of cotton, an increase of about 100,000 dan over last year, exceeding the original production increase target.
    Cooperativization is the main key to the bumper cotton harvest. The cotton of more than 600 agricultural producers' cooperatives in the county generally increased in yield this year. Under the promotion of the cooperatives, the nearby mutual aid teams and individual farmers also achieved increased production. According to statistics from agricultural cooperatives in twelve townships of Guancheng District, more than 8,000 mu of cotton fields averaged more than 300 jin of seed cotton per mu, more than 1,000 mu of cotton fields averaged more than 400 jin of seed cotton per mu, and a new record of more than 500 jin of seed cotton per mu appeared. The more cooperatives there are, the higher the cotton yield. In Xiaolin District, which has the most cooperatives in the county, the average yield of more than 80,000 mu of cotton fields in the district was 89 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year, creating a new record for large-scale bumper harvests.
    Farmers saw the superiority of agricultural cooperatives in production, and after hearing Chairman Mao's transmission on the issue of agricultural cooperativization, their enthusiasm for taking the socialist road was further enhanced. Recently, more than 24,000 farm households in the county have joined cooperatives, and more than 570 mutual aid teams are preparing to switch to cooperatives.
    The Cixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China formulated a comprehensive plan for agricultural cooperativization in early October, requiring that this winter and next spring, on the basis of the existing 690 cooperatives and 20.24 percent of the total number of farm households in the county, in addition to expanding the old cooperatives, 800 new cooperatives will be established, and the number of farm households joining cooperatives will reach 50.72 percent of the total number of farm households in the county. By the winter of 1957, 90 percent of the farmers in the county will participate in agricultural cooperatives. At the same time as the cooperativization plan, a production plan was also formulated: the cotton yield is required to average 81 jin per mu next year, and 87 jin per mu the year after next.
    The farmers of Cixi after the bumper harvest are currently vigorously carrying out the work of expanding and establishing cooperatives and autumn harvesting and winter planting, wholeheartedly striving to increase cotton production to support industrial construction.

　　棉花丰产的慈溪县
　　唐武声
    祖国东南海边上的慈溪县，是一块面积五十多万亩的大平原。这里是我国棉花产量较高的一个县，今年又获得空前大丰收，全县平均产量每亩达七十三斤多，比刚解放的时候增加一倍以上。今年全县共产棉花三十五万担以上，比去年增加十万担左右，超额完成原订增产指标。
    合作化是棉花大丰收的主要关键。全县六百多个农业生产合作社的棉花，今年普遍增产。在合作社的推动下，附近的互助组和个体农民也都获得增产。据观城区十二个乡的农业合作社统计，有八千多亩棉田每亩平均收籽棉三百多斤，有一千多亩棉田每亩平均收籽棉四百斤，并出现了每亩收五百多斤籽棉的丰产新纪录。哪里的合作社越多，哪里的棉花产量就越高。全县合作社最多的逍林区，全区八万多亩棉田，今年每亩平均收皮棉八十九斤，创造了大面积丰收的新纪录。
    农民看到农业合作社在生产上的优越性，又听到毛主席关于农业合作化问题的传达后，走社会主义道路的积极性更加提高了。最近全县已有二万四千多农户入社，还有五百七十多个互助组准备转社。
    中共慈溪县委已在十月初订出了全县农业合作化的全面规划，要求今冬明春，全县在原有的六百九十个社、入社农户占全县总农户百分之二十点二四的基础上，除扩大老社外，建立新社八百个，入社农户达到全县总农户的百分之五十点七二。全县在一九五七年冬，将有百分之九十的农户参加农业合作社。在合作化规划的同时，又订出了生产规划：棉花产量要求明年每亩平均产八十一斤，后年每亩平均产八十七斤。
    丰收后的慈溪农民，目前正在大力进行扩社、建社和秋收冬种工作，一心一意地为增产更多的棉花支援工业建设而努力。
