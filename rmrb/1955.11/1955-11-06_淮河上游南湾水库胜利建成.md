    The Victorious Completion of the Nanwan Reservoir in the Upper Reaches of the Huai River
    The Nanwan Reservoir was victoriously completed on the 5th. This is a large-scale reservoir within the water conservancy construction projects of the state's First Five-Year Plan.
    The Nanwan Reservoir is built on the Shi River, a tributary of the upper reaches of the Huai River, within Xinyang County, Henan Province. The project includes a 743-meter-long and 34-meter-high dam, a 258-meter-long water diversion tunnel, and a spillway. The Shi River basin covers an area of more than 2,000 square kilometers and is a rainy area. Every flood season, mountain torrents erupt, and ferocious floods break through dikes, engulfing the fields and villages on both sides of the Shi River, and threatening the safety of Xinyang City and the Beijing-Hankou Railway. In the dry season, the river is shallow and cannot be used for irrigation and navigation. After the reservoir is built, it controls more than 1,000 square kilometers of the Shi River basin. During times of heavy rain, the reservoir can hold more than 910 million cubic meters of floodwater, which not only reduces the flood peak of the main stream of the Huai River, but also permanently protects 300,000 mu of farmland on both sides of the Shi River from flood disasters, ensuring the safety of Xinyang City and the Beijing-Hankou Railway. Utilizing the reservoir's water storage, it can generate more than 9 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, irrigate 110,000 mu of farmland, and the Shi River can also be navigable all year round.
    Construction of the Nanwan Reservoir project began in December 1952. Due to some technical problems during construction, work was suspended for more than a year. These technical problems were resolved one by one with the help of Soviet experts, and full-scale construction began this spring. More than 80,000 reservoir builders overcame the severe cold of winter and the scorching heat of summer, and completed the dam in just over ten months. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 淮河上游南湾水库胜利建成

    淮河上游南湾水库胜利建成
    南湾水库已在五日胜利建成。这是国家第一个五年计划中水利建设项内的一座大型水库。
    南湾水库建筑在河南省信阳县境内淮河上游支流溮河上。工程包括七百四十三公尺长、三十四公尺高的拦河大坝，二百五十八公尺长的输水隧洞和溢洪道等。溮河流域面积二千多平方公里，是多雨地带。每逢汛期，山洪暴发，凶恶的洪水冲破了堤防，吞没着溮河两岸的田园和村庄，并且威胁着信阳市和京汉铁路的安全；枯水季节，河道水浅不能灌溉和航运。水库建成后，控制着溮河流域一千多平方公里。大水的时候，水库可拦蓄洪水九亿一千多万公方，不但削减淮河干流洪峰，而且使溮河两岸三十万亩农田永远免除洪水灾害，保障信阳市和京汉铁路的安全。利用水库的蓄水，每年可以发电九百多万度，可以灌溉十一万亩农田，溮河还可以终年通航。
    南湾水库工程从一九五二年十二月开始施工。在施工中由于发生了一些技术上的问题，曾停工一年多。这些技术问题在苏联专家帮助下，一一得到解决，今春开始了全面大施工。八万多名水库建设者们战胜了严寒的冬季和酷热的夏天，在十个多月中就把大坝建成了。　（据新华社讯）
