Comrades and Friends!

	We are very honored that the current International Friendship Shooting Competition of the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of China is being held in Beijing, the capital of our country. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam has also sent an observer delegation. On the occasion of the opening of this competition, I would like to extend a warm welcome to the delegations from all brotherly countries on behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China and the Chinese people, and extend my heartfelt congratulations to everyone!

	Dear comrades, in the socialist family, every brotherly country, under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist party, all sports activities are for the benefit of the working people, and are permeated with the noble ideas of patriotism and internationalism. Our people exercise their bodies only to better engage in creative labor, promote economic and cultural prosperity, and realize socialism and communism; at the same time, strengthen our national defense forces, protect our motherland from infringement, and enable the people of all countries to coexist peacefully. Our goal is peace and friendship.

	The fraternal friendship and unity between us will be further consolidated and strengthened through this competition. This international friendship shooting competition will also be a huge impetus to the development of mass shooting sports in China.

	We know that shooting sports have a history of hundreds of years in many European countries. After the people of the brother countries have mastered power, this sport has acquired a new social nature and a mass scale. You have cultivated thousands upon thousands of excellent shooting athletes, many of whom are sharpshooters, who have won honor for their countries in the competition field. We are willing to learn from you. The Chinese people, like the people of all brotherly countries, are always mindful of their responsibility in defending the construction of the motherland and safeguarding world peace. Therefore, they warmly welcome this international friendship shooting competition. However, we are still a first-year student in organizing and participating in such competitions, treating shooting as a sports item. Chinese male and female shooting athletes and sports workers should regard this competition as a training course, and modestly learn from the experience accumulated by all brother countries in many years of shooting sports—especially learning from the advanced shooting experience of the Soviet Union. We hope to continuously improve our results and further promote the development of mass shooting sports in our country, so as to strengthen the defense of our motherland's socialist construction.

	The sending of shooting delegations by the brother countries to participate in the competition and to give wonderful performances will be an encouragement to our shooting athletes and the people. This friendship competition will be recorded as a major event in the history of the development of shooting sports in our country.

	Let me congratulate you again, wish you good health! Wish you victory!

	Long live the unbreakable friendship of the peace, democracy and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union!

　　贺龙副总理在射击竞赛大会上的讲话亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    苏联、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和中华人民共和国本届国际友谊射击竞赛在我国的首都北京举行，越南民主共和国也派来了观察代表团，我们感到非常荣幸。在这次竞赛大会开幕的时候，我代表中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，热烈地欢迎各兄弟国家代表团的光临，并向大家致以衷心的祝贺！
    亲爱的同志们，我们社会主义大家庭中的各个兄弟国家，在马克思列宁主义的党领导之下，全部的体育活动都是为了劳动人民的利益，贯串着爱国主义和国际主义的崇高思想。我们的人民锻炼自己的身体，只是为了更好地进行创造性的劳动，促进经济和文化的繁荣，实现社会主义和共产主义；同时，加强我们的国防力量，保卫自己的祖国不受侵犯，使各国人民能够和平共处。我们的目的，就是和平与友谊。
    我们之间的兄弟般的友谊和团结，将通过这次竞赛而获得进一步的巩固和加强。这次国际友谊射击竞赛，对中国群众性的射击运动的开展也将是一个巨大的推动。
    我们知道，射击运动在欧洲许多国家已经有了上百年的历史。各兄弟国家在人民掌握了政权以后，这项运动更具有了崭新的社会性质和群众性的规模。你们已经培养出来成千、上万的优秀射击运动员，其中有不少是百发百中的射手，已经在竞赛场上为自己的国家争得荣誉，我们愿意向你们学习。中国人民和各兄弟国家的人民一样，时刻想到自己在保卫祖国建设和维护世界和平中的责任。因而对这次国际友谊射击竞赛表示热烈欢迎。但是，把射击作为一个体育运动的项目，组织和参加这样的比赛，我们还是个一年级的小学生。中国的男女射击运动员和体育工作者们，应当把这次竞赛大会看做一次训练的课程，虚心地学习各兄弟国家在多年射击运动中所积累起来的经验——特别是学习苏联的先进的射击经验。我们希望不断提高自己的成绩，并进一步推动我国群众性的射击运动的开展，以加强保卫我们祖国的社会主义建设。
    各兄弟国家派遣射击代表团来参加比赛，并且还要作精采表演，对我国射击运动员和人民群众将是一种鼓舞。这次友谊竞赛，将作为一个重大事件记录在我国射击运动发展的历史上。
    让我再一次祝贺你们，祝你们健康！祝你们胜利！
    以苏联为首的和平民主社会主义阵营牢不可破的友谊万岁！
