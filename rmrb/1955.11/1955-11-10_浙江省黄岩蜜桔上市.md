Fresh Zhejiang Huangyan honey oranges are now on the market. Recently, more than 40,000 orange farmers on both sides of the Chengjiang River are happily harvesting the fruits of their labor for the year. The Zhejiang Branch of the China Food Company established seven purchasing stations in the production area. After opening for business on October 25th, they purchased 7.2 million jin of honey oranges in seven days. These honey oranges were shipped from the production area at the end of October. The first batch of more than 4 million jin of honey oranges for export to the Soviet Union has also been shipped. More than 1 million jin of honey oranges are now being transported from the production area to Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Shenyang and other places for sale every day.

In order to ensure that the ripe honey oranges are picked and transported to various places quickly, the purchasing stations of the Zhejiang Food Company and the local orange farmers have formulated purchasing methods that specify time, quantity, and quality. The orange farmers have formed more than 200 picking and selling groups based on villages, and organized orange picking and selling teams led by production cooperatives and mutual aid teams for individual orange farmers.

Although this year is a small harvest year for Huangyan honey oranges, and it has also been affected by drought and pests, after the orange farmers vigorously fought the drought and prevented pests and diseases, the qualification rate of oranges for export can still reach 66%. In order to strive for a bumper harvest of oranges next year, the Provincial Department of Agriculture has allocated 800,000 jin of cake fertilizer to the orange-growing areas in September. At present, the orange farmers are carrying out intensive harvesting while fertilizing, cleaning the orchards, and pruning branches to prevent frost damage to the orange trees.

    浙江省黄岩蜜桔上市
    鲜美的浙江黄岩蜜桔已经上市。近日来，澄江两岸四万多桔农正在愉快地收获一年来的劳动果实。中国食品公司浙江省公司在产地设立的七个收购站，十月二十五日开称后，七天中收购了蜜桔七百二十万斤，这些蜜桔均已在十月底由产地启运。第一批外销苏联的四百多万斤蜜桔，也已启运。现在每日都有一百多万斤蜜桔从产地运往上海、北京、天津、沈阳等地销售。
    为了使成熟的蜜桔迅速地采摘运往各地，浙江省食品公司收购站和当地桔农制定了定时、定量、定质的收购办法；桔农们以村为单位成立二百多个采售组，并以生产合作社和互助组为单位带领单干桔农组织了采桔、卖桔小组。
    今年黄岩蜜桔虽属小年，又逢旱情和虫害侵袭，但是经过桔农大力的抗旱和病虫害的防治后，桔果外销的合格率仍可达到百分之六十六。为了争取明年桔果丰收，省农业厅已于九月份拨发饼肥八十万斤到桔区，目前，桔农们一面进行紧张的采收一面进行施肥和清园修枝的工作，以防止桔树冻害。
