Zheng Zhenduo delivered a speech on behalf of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China at the closing ceremony, congratulating the German musicians on the success of their visit and performances, and expressing his regards for their hard work over the past month. Zheng Zhenduo said: "Through your outstanding performances, the Chinese people have had the opportunity to appreciate the works of outstanding German composers such as Bach, Beethoven, and Schubert, thereby further understanding the infinitely rich art of the German people. This has a positive effect on enhancing the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people and promoting cultural exchanges between the two countries."
