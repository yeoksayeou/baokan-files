The Gansu Farm Implement Factory, in order to vigorously support the agricultural cooperativization movement, has decided to increase production, on top of fulfilling its annual plan, by another two thousand Liberation-style waterwheels and four thousand walking plows.

Currently, the factory's workers are actively researching improvements to work methods to ensure the completion of the increased production task. The foundry workshop exceeded nine quotas in the second half of October and also reduced the reject rate. Many workers in the forging workshop have improved their tools and learned advanced operating methods, generally increasing work efficiency by more than 50%. To reduce production costs, the factory recently converted its original cupola furnace to a hot-blast stove, which doubled the iron smelting efficiency. In addition, to ensure product quality, they have strengthened the inspection of tools and dies, as well as the inspection of raw materials, blanks, and semi-finished products.

　　甘肃农具制造厂计划增产六千部新农具
    甘肃省农具制造厂为了大力支援农业合作化运动，决定在完成全年计划的基础上，再增产两千部解放式水车和四千部步犁。
    目前，这个厂的职工们正在积极研究改进工作，保证完成增产任务。铸工车间在十月后半月突破九种定额，并且降低了废品率。锻工车间不少工人改进了工具，学习了先进的操作方法，工作效率一般都提高了百分之五十以上。这个厂为了降低生产成本，最近把原来的化铁炉改为热风炉，使化铁效率提高了一倍半。另外，为了保证产品的质量，还加强了对工具、模具等的检查和对原材料、毛胚、半成品等的检验工作。　（本报驻兰州记者）
