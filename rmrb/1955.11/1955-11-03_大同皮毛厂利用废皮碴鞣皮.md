    Datong Tannery Utilizes Waste Leather Scraps for Tanning
    Workers at the Datong Tannery in Shanxi Province are using waste leather scraps to replace some grain in the process of tanning raw hides. Since August alone, this has saved the state over 3,700 catties of grain.
    In the past, the workers used fermented millet and foxtail millet flour entirely to tan raw hides, consuming more than 100,000 catties of grain each year. Since the state called for grain conservation, Hao Pingzheng, the former factory director, noticed that the waste leather scraps from tanned hides still contained a considerable amount of rice and flour. He proposed utilizing these scraps. After two experiments by the workers, the results were very good. In the past, the last batch of vats for tanning sheepskin required 70 catties of fermented grain; now, only 35 catties of grain are used, plus 70 catties of waste leather scraps. The quality of the tanned leather is the same as before. Currently, the workers are storing all the waste leather scraps that were previously discarded, preparing to use them in production next year.

    大同皮毛厂利用废皮碴鞣皮
    山西省大同皮毛厂职工在鞣制原皮过程中，利用废皮碴代替部分粮食，仅自八月份以来，即为国家节约粮食三千七百余斤。
    过去，职工在鞣制原皮过程中完全采用小米和糜子米粉发酵来鞣制原皮，每年要消耗十万多斤粮食。自从国家号召节约粮食以后，原厂长郝平正发现鞣制过的毛皮的废皮碴里仍夹有不少米面，提出了利用废皮碴的建议。经过职工们两次试验，效果很好。过去鞣制羊皮时，最后一茬缸要用七十斤粮食发酵，现在只用粮食三十五斤，另加七十斤废皮碴。鞣制出的皮子质量也和过去一样。目前，职工们正把过去抛弃的废皮碴都储存起来，准备在明年生产的时候使用。
