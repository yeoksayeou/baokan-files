The Northwest Railway Design Bureau recently completed the preliminary design of the Sanmenxia Railway spur line. This railway spur line is more than twelve kilometers long, starting from the Huixing Station on the Longhai Railway and reaching a location more than three kilometers from the construction site. It bears the responsibility of transporting construction materials such as sand, gravel, and cement, as well as large-scale power generation equipment, needed for the massive Sanmenxia project. Products from many subsidiary factories serving the Sanmenxia project along the railway line, such as the lumber mill, rebar processing plant, and precast reinforced concrete component factory, will also be transported to the construction site via this railway.

    三门峡铁路完成初步设计
    西北铁路设计分局最近完成了三门峡铁路专用线的初步设计。这条铁路专用线有十二多公里长，由陇海铁路的会兴车站开始，直达距离工地三公里多的地方，负担着运输三门峡巨大工程所需要的沙石、水泥等建筑器材和庞大的发电设备。铁路沿线的许多为三门峡工程服务的附属工厂如制材厂、钢筋加工厂、钢筋混凝土预制构件厂等的产品也要经过这条铁路运到工地。　（本报驻兰州记者）
