Young Pioneers Celebrate With Writers

On the evening of the 26th, the Chinese Writers Association and the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League jointly held a children's literature party. At the meeting, more than 600 young pioneers from Beijing met with their beloved writers.

The venue was the auditorium of the Central Committee of the Youth League. The children, wearing colorful clothes and red scarves, came to the party as if celebrating a holiday.

At 7 o'clock, the party began with the song "Song of the Young Pioneers." The young chairman and twelve Young Pioneer members gave a unique opening speech. They recited: In our lives, books are our closest companions, but in our daily lives, there are so few companions. We go to bookstores every day and always see only a few books. Occasionally, there is a new book, but it is only a few pages thick, and it is finished in one sitting. Also, the stories in the books, after reading the beginning, we can guess the end. In folk tales, there are always three sons. We wonder, why is the youngest son always the best? Writer uncles and aunts, you are our intimate friends, please write more books for us. We hope you will fulfill your promises like Young Pioneer members!

We believe in Gorky's words: All my virtues are given to me by books.

Then, Lao She, vice chairman of the Chinese Writers Association, and Zhang Ze, secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, took the stage one after another amidst the children's warm applause. Lao She said: Writers and children should have met long ago. We have written too little for the children in the past. In the future, we must write more and better, and it can't always be "three sons, the youngest is the best." Zhang Ze said: Today, there are veteran writers, children's literature creators, teachers, counselors, and children present. It is rare for three generations to meet together like today. Today, these three generations are connected by one thing, and that is books. Zhang Ze said that the Youth League has a responsibility: to organize young pioneers to better connect with writers and make children's literature more prosperous.

The evening's entertainment program was attractive. The children performed chorus, poetry recitation, and fairy tales, etc. The young pianist Zhu Zhu also played two solo pieces. The poet Yuan Ying recited his work "A Child Was Killed in America." When the interesting children's story "Seven-Colored Flower" was recited, the children danced with joy.

The celebration began. The children laughed and shouted, asking the writers to play with them, and the writers happily participated in various games. In the circle of hide-and-seek, the playwright Cao Yu, who was blindfolded, caught the writer Liu Baiyu, who was playing hide-and-seek, which made the children laugh endlessly. The writer Ma Feng finished the group dance and joined the "kicking football" game. The poet Sha Ou played with the children again and again, sweating profusely from the heat. Children's literature writer Jin Jin was surrounded by children, and the photographer hurriedly came over to capture this intimate scene in the lens.

Some children did not participate in the games, they looked around for writers' autographs.

At the party, the children and writers also watched the Soviet children's story film "The Dagger."

### 少年儿童同作家们联欢

　　少年儿童同作家们联欢
    二十六日晚上，中国作家协会和中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会联合举办了一个少年儿童文学晚会。会上，北京六百多个少年儿童同他们敬爱的作家见了面。
    会场设在青年团中央委员会大礼堂。穿着花衣服、戴着红领巾的孩子们像过节一样地来参加晚会。
    七点钟，在“红领巾之歌”的歌声中，晚会开始了。小主席和十二名少年先锋队队员致了一个别致的开幕词。他们朗诵道：在我们的生活中，书是最亲密的伙伴，可是在我们每天的生活里，伙伴是那么样少，我们天天到书店，看到总是那么几本，偶然有一本新书，也是薄薄几页，一看就完，还有那书里的故事，看了前面就想到后面，民间故事里总有三个儿子，我们奇怪，为什么总是小儿子最好？作家叔叔、姑姑们，你们是我们知心的朋友，多给我们写些书吧。希望你们像少年先锋队队员一样实现自己的诺言！
    我们相信高尔基的话：我的一切优点，都是书给我的。
    接着，中国作家协会副主席老舍和中国新民主主义青年团中央书记处书记章泽在孩子们热烈的掌声中先后登台讲话。老舍说：作家和小朋友早就应该见面。以前我们给小朋友们写得太少。今后一定要写得更多、更好，不能总是“三个儿子，小的最好”了。章泽说：今天到会的有老一辈的作家，有少年儿童文学创作者、教师、辅导员，还有小朋友们，像今天这样，三代人在一起开会是不多见的。今天这三代人被一种东西联系起来了，它就是书。章泽说，青年团有一个责任：组织少年儿童更好地和作家联系，使少年儿童文学事业更繁荣。
    晚会的文艺节目是吸引人的。孩子们演出了合唱、朗诵诗和童话故事等，小钢琴手朱珠还独奏了两只曲子。诗人袁鹰朗诵了他的作品“在美国一个孩子被杀死了”。当朗诵有趣味的儿童故事“七色花”的时候，孩子们都眉飞眼舞地乐了起来。
    联欢开始了。孩子们笑着嚷着，要作家同他们一起玩，作家们兴高采烈地参加了花样繁多的游戏。在捉迷藏的圈子里，蒙住眼睛的剧作家曹禺一把捉住了正在捉迷藏的作家刘白羽，逗得孩子们笑个不完。作家马烽跳完了集体舞又加入玩“踢足球”游戏。诗人沙鸥和孩子们玩了又玩，热得不住地擦汗。儿童文学作家金近被孩子们包围了，摄影记者赶忙过来把这个亲密的场面摄入镜头。
    有些孩子没有去参加游戏，他们四下找作家签名。
    在晚会上，孩子们和作家们还看了苏联儿童故事影片“短剑”。
