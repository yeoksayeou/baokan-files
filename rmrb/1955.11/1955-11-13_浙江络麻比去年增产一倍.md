Zhejiang Ramie Production Doubles Compared to Last Year

Zhejiang Province, a major ramie producing area, has achieved another bumper harvest of ramie this year. The province's total ramie production has doubled compared to last year.

According to statistics from over 220,000 mu of ramie in Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and Shangyu counties, the average yield per mu reached over 451 jin. The highest yield was achieved by the Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yipeng District, Xiaoshan, where 228 mu of ramie fields averaged 607 jin per mu. The New Feng Qingpi, Bailian Zhi, and Jikou Huangma improved varieties, which were promoted on over 500 mu in the province this year, also grew very well. The Hongqi Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Linping District, Hangzhou County, planted 150 mu of Bailian Zhi, with an average yield of 600 jin per mu, and the highest reaching 750 jin.

Ramie is a major raw material for the textile industry and also a raw material for coastal fishermen to weave fishing nets. In order to increase the yield per unit area to support industrial construction, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture, in addition to leading ramie farmers to select improved varieties, sow in a timely manner, plant in rows with close spacing, and apply fertilizer rationally, also designated the Hongqi, Huoxing, and Xinmin Agricultural Production Cooperatives and a state-owned farm to breed New Feng Qingpi, Bailian Zhi, and Jikou Huangma improved varieties. It is expected that the area planted with improved varieties will increase by 1,200 mu next year, and reach 250,000 mu by 1957.

　  浙江络麻比去年增产一倍
    主要产麻区浙江省今年络麻又获丰收，全省络麻的总产量比去年增加一倍。
    据该省萧山、绍兴、上虞三个县二十二万多亩络麻的收获量统计，平均每亩产量达四百五十一斤多，最高的萧山义蓬区新民农业生产合作社二百二十八亩麻田平均每亩产量达六百零七斤。今年该省推广的五百多亩新丰青皮、白莲芝、吉口黄麻良种，生长也很好，杭县临平区红旗高级农业生产合作社新植的一百五十亩白莲芝，平均每亩产量达六百斤，最高的到七百五十斤。
    络麻是麻纺工业的主要原料，也是沿海渔民编结渔网的原料。浙江省农业厅为了增加单位面积产量支援工业建设，今年除了领导麻农选用良种做到适时播种、条播密植和合理增施肥料等技术措施外，并指定红旗、火星、新民三个农业生产合作社和一个国营农场繁殖新丰青皮、白莲芝、吉口黄麻良种，预计明年良种可增植一千二百亩。到一九五七年可达二十五万亩。
