Xinhua News Agency, 20th. Currently, the agricultural cooperativization movement in rural areas across the country has flourished, and a massive mass movement climax has formed in most areas. With the exception of some border areas, whether in old or new areas, plains or mountainous regions, and even in some backward villages, the broad masses of peasants (mainly poor and lower-middle peasants) are actively establishing new agricultural production cooperatives or joining old agricultural production cooperatives. According to statistics from early August to early November, more than 590,000 new agricultural production cooperatives have been established nationwide. Including the original 650,000 agricultural production cooperatives, there are now more than 1.24 million agricultural production cooperatives in the country.

Some provinces in North China and Northeast China already experienced a high tide of the agricultural cooperativization movement in the autumn and winter of last year. Some provinces have now completed their plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives ahead of schedule for this winter and next spring, some provinces are close to completing their development plans, and some provinces are carrying out large-scale activities to establish new cooperatives and expand old cooperatives. Hebei Province completed its plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives for this winter and next spring on October 20th. Now, the number of peasant households joining cooperatives in the province accounts for 60.7 percent of the total number of peasant households. At present, in areas with relatively advanced cooperativization, old cooperatives are being expanded and merged. It is estimated that approximately 97,000 old cooperatives have been merged into more than 60,000 large or medium-sized cooperatives. Shanxi Province has basically completed its plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives for this winter and next spring, with more than 45,000 cooperatives in the province, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives reaching 63.4 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, and Rehe provinces entered a new high tide of large-scale establishment of new cooperatives and expansion of old cooperatives in early November. The framework for establishing new cooperatives in these provinces has been set up, and the peasant households preparing to join old cooperatives have registered with the old cooperatives. Now, they are dealing with various specific issues of joining cooperatives.

Most provinces in East China, Central South China, Southwest China, and Northwest China are experiencing the first wave of major development in the agricultural cooperativization movement this year. The characteristics of the agricultural cooperativization movement in these areas are rapid development and large numbers. Shandong Province originally planned to develop 140,000 agricultural production cooperatives throughout the province, with the number of peasant households joining cooperatives reaching 3.75 million. As of October 15th, more than 180,000 agricultural production cooperatives had been developed throughout the province, with the number of peasant households joining cooperatives reaching 5.75 million, accounting for 50 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province. Jiangsu Province completed its plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives for this winter and next spring on October 26th. Now, there are more than 146,000 cooperatives in the province, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives has also reached 50 percent of the total number of peasant households. Henan Province's original plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives is now close to completion, and the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is preparing to revise the original plan. Zhejiang Province has overfulfilled its plan for developing new cooperatives. Sichuan Province plans to develop more than 129,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 57,000 have now been established. Hunan Province plans to develop more than 75,000 agricultural production cooperatives, and more than 35,000 have now been established. The winter development plans of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces were completed by the end of October. The work of developing cooperatives in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces is also progressing relatively quickly. The work of establishing cooperatives in Gansu Province has generally begun. The cooperative establishment movement in Shaanxi Province has just begun. Hubei Province has made a series of preparations, and the cooperative establishment movement has begun. It is estimated that by around the Spring Festival, 70,000 to 80,000 cooperatives will be established throughout the province, and the number of peasant households joining cooperatives is planned to reach about 35 percent of the total number of peasant households in the province.

In border areas inhabited by ethnic minorities and areas with mixed ethnic populations, provinces and autonomous regions that have undergone land reform and have a foundation for mutual assistance and cooperation, such as Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Qinghai, have also successively launched agricultural cooperativization movements. Among them, the progress in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is relatively fast. It is estimated that by the spring ploughing next year, the proportion of peasant households joining cooperatives in the entire autonomous region will increase from the current 17.27 percent to about 35 percent.

Judging from the trend of large-scale development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in various places, due to the fact that local Communist Party organizations have conscientiously studied and conveyed Chairman Mao's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization" and the Resolution on the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization of the Sixth Plenary Session (En Larged) of the Seventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, criticized the right-leaning erroneous ideas in leading the agricultural cooperativization movement in the past, and strengthened the leadership of the movement, therefore, the development of the movement on a national scale is rapid, the scale is huge, and it is also healthy. The quality of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives is generally up to the requirements.

According to investigations in various places, the vast majority of peasants who have newly joined agricultural production cooperatives are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants. In Hebei Province, more than 80 percent of the peasant households joining old and new cooperatives are poor peasants and lower-middle peasants. In the Linyi Special Zone of Shandong Province, 80 percent of the poor peasants and 50 to 60 percent of the lower-middle peasants have joined agricultural production cooperatives. In areas with a long history of cooperativization, a good foundation, a large number of cooperatives, and significant production achievements, such as some areas in Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces, a small number of upper-middle peasants have also truly seen the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and voluntarily requested to join cooperatives.

During the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives in various places, they have all followed the policy of "overall planning and strengthening leadership" instructed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, and have initially formulated plans for developing agricultural production cooperatives. The persons in charge of many provincial, prefectural, county, and district committees have generally gone deep into rural areas to understand the situation before planning, and some have also helped local areas solve the difficulties in formulating plans.

The vast majority of the newly established agricultural production cooperatives in various places have been established on the basis of mutual aid teams and joint mutual aid teams, and at the same time, the establishment of cooperatives has been closely combined with current agricultural activities such as autumn harvesting and autumn planting, and winter production. In the process of establishing cooperatives, Jiangsu, Guangdong, and other provinces have closely combined with current production, requiring new members to the cooperatives to discuss the establishment of cooperatives while producing under the leadership of the preparatory committee for the establishment of the cooperatives. Therefore, it is generally achieved that both the establishment of cooperatives and production are not delayed.

At present, the agricultural cooperativization movement across the country is developing unevenly due to different objective conditions in different regions. Now, areas that have completed their development plans are carrying out consolidation work on agricultural production cooperatives in conjunction with winter production; areas that are developing cooperatives are paying close attention to the quality of agricultural production cooperatives; areas that have not yet taken action are formulating and revising plans. The phenomenon of relatively rough establishment of cooperatives in a few places is being corrected.

### 全国农业生产合作社　发展到一百二十四万多个

　　全国农业生产合作社
　　发展到一百二十四万多个
    据新华社二十日讯　目前，全国农村中的农业合作化运动已经蓬勃展开，大多数地区已经形成声势浩大的群众运动的高潮。除了某些边疆地区以外，无论是老区或新区，平原或山区，甚至在某些落后乡，广大农民（主要是贫农和下中农）都在积极地建立新的农业生产合作社或者参加老的农业生产合作社。从八月初到十一月上旬的统计，全国已经新建立了五十九万多个农业生产合作社，加上原有的六十五万个农业生产合作社在内，现在全国共有一百二十四万多个农业生产合作社。
    华北和东北地区的一些省份在去年秋季冬季就已经出现了农业合作化运动的高潮。现在有些省已经提前完成了今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的计划，有些省接近完成了发展计划，有些省正在大规模地开展建立新社和扩大老社的活动。河北省在十月二十日已经完成了今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的计划，现在全省入社农户已经占农户总数百分之六十点七，目前在合作化比较先进的地区，正在扩大和合并老社，据估计，大约有九万七千多个老社已经合并为六万多个大社或中等社。山西省已经基本上完成了今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的计划，全省已有四万五千多个社，入社农户达到全省农户总数的百分之六十三点四。黑龙江、辽宁、吉林、热河四省，十一月初已经进入大规模地建立新社、扩大老社的新高潮。这些省准备建立新社的架子已经搭成，准备加入老社的农户已经向老社报了名，现在正在处理入社的各种具体问题。
    华东、中南、西南、西北地区的大部分省份今年是农业合作化运动大发展的第一个浪潮。这些地区农业合作化运动的特点是发展快，数量大。山东省原计划全省发展到十四万个农业生产合作社，入社农户达到三百七十五万户，到十月十五日止，全省已经发展到十八万个农业生产合作社，入社农户达到五百七十五万户，占全省农户总数的百分之五十。江苏省在十月二十六日已经完成了今冬明春发展农业生产合作社的计划，现在全省共有十四万六千多个社，入社农户也达到农户总数的百分之五十。河南省原订发展农业生产合作社的计划现在已经接近完成，中共河南省委员会正准备修订原来的计划。浙江省发展新社的计划已经超额完成。四川省计划发展到十二万九千多个农业生产合作社，现在已经建成五万七千多个。湖南省计划发展到七万五千多个农业生产合作社，现在已经建成三万五千多个。云南、贵州两省的冬季发展计划在十月底就已经完成。广东、广西、江西、福建等省，发展社的工作进展也比较快。甘肃省建社工作已普遍开始。陕西省建社运动刚刚开始。湖北省已经做好了一系列的准备工作，建社运动已经开始，预计到春节前后，全省将建成七万到八万个社，入社农户计划达到全省农户总数的百分之三十五左右。
    在边疆的少数民族聚居地区和民族杂居地区，其中经过土地改革的、已有互助合作基础的省和自治区，如内蒙古、新疆、青海等地，也先后开展了农业合作化运动，其中以内蒙古自治区进展比较快，预计到明年春耕前，入社农户占全自治区农户总数的比例将由现在的百分之十七点二七发展到百分之三十五左右。
    从各地农业合作化运动大发展的趋势来看，由于各地共产党组织认真学习和传达了毛主席“关于农业合作化问题”的报告和中国共产党七届六中全会（扩大）关于农业合作化问题的决议，批判了过去领导农业合作化运动中的右倾的错误思想，加强了对运动的领导，因此，运动在全国范围内的发展是迅速的，规模是巨大的，也是健康的，新建立的农业生产合作社的质量一般是合乎要求的。
    根据各地的调查，这次新加入农业生产合作社的农民，绝大部分是贫农和新、老中农中间的下中农。河北省全省加入老社和新社的农户中，百分之八十以上都是贫农和下中农。山东省临沂专区有百分之八十的贫农和百分之五十到六十的下中农加入了农业生产合作社。在合作化历史较久、基础较好、社的数量较多、生产成绩也很显著的地区，例如黑龙江、河北、山西、山东等省的有些地区，也有少部分上中农确实看到了农业生产合作社的优越性，自愿要求入社。
    这次各地在大规模发展农业生产合作社的过程中，都遵照中共中央和毛主席指示的“全面规划、加强领导”的方针，初步制定了发展农业生产合作社的规划。许多省委、地委、县委、区委的负责人，在规划前普遍深入农村了解情况，有的还帮助当地解决了制定规划的困难。
    各地新建立起来的农业生产合作社，绝大部分都是在互助组和互助组联合组的基础上建成的，同时在建社中又紧密结合了当前的秋收秋种、冬季生产等农事活动。江苏、广东等省在建社过程中，都密切结合当前生产，要求入社的新社员，在建社筹备委员会领导下，一边生产，一边讨论建社。因此一般做到了建社、生产两不误。
    目前全国各地农业合作化运动由于不同地区有着不同的客观条件，发展还不平衡。现在，已完成发展计划的地区，正在结合冬季生产对农业生产合作社进行整顿巩固工作；正在发展社的地区，都密切注意农业生产合作社的质量；还没有行动起来的地区，正在制定和修订规划。少数地方建社比较粗糙的现象，已在注意纠正。
