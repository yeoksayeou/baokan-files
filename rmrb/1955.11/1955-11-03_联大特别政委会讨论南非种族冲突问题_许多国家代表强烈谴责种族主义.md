Xinhua News Agency, New York, November 2nd: The United Nations General Assembly's Special Political Committee is currently discussing the issue of racial conflict in South Africa. Many national representatives strongly condemned racism during the discussion.

    This issue has been discussed at past sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, and the Assembly has repeatedly adopted resolutions requesting the government of the Union of South Africa to cease implementing its apartheid policy. However, the South African government has refused to implement the Assembly's resolutions. In its report submitted to the current General Assembly, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on the Question of Race Relations in the Union of South Africa stated that, despite widespread international opposition in the past year, the South African government's general policy of apartheid has not changed. A series of legislative measures it has taken on racial issues not only contradict the obligations assumed by the Union of South Africa under the United Nations Charter, but also contradict the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The report pointed out that the policies implemented by the Union of South Africa constitute a threat to the national life of the country. Africans currently have no representation in the Parliament of the Union of South Africa, they cannot find work in some industries engaged in by white people, and they are discriminated against in education and housing.

    Chilean representative Mr. Santa Cruz, chairman of the Commission of Inquiry, said that world public opinion should be given importance when discussing the South African racial conflict issue. He specifically mentioned the Bandung Asian-African Conference in this regard. He said, "In studying the discussions of the Bandung Conference, the deepest impression the Commission of Inquiry gained was that the issue of racial discrimination... touched the depths of the hearts of the free peoples of Asia and Africa." The demand for racial equality is a deeply rooted sentiment of the Asian and African people, and "the pressure from those people who have not yet obtained full rights (demanding equality) cannot be suppressed, and these pressures will erupt like a volcano."

    Egyptian representative Mahmoud pointed out that at the Bandung Conference, Asian and African countries unanimously condemned racial discrimination. Asian and African countries demand an end to this discrimination in order to restore human dignity. The United Nations should continue its efforts to promote the resolution of the issue of racism.

    Iraqi representative Khalidi said: "The movement against racism has taken root, and this movement is supported by most parts of the world." He said, "There is no place in the world that is not currently demanding equality and justice. This awakening is the death knell of colonialism." He pointed out that the South African people's resistance to racial discrimination cannot be suppressed by planes and machine guns.

    Syrian representative Daoudi pointed out that the apartheid policy poses a danger of bloody conflict. He suggested establishing a conciliation committee to try to resolve the racial conflict in South Africa.

    The representative of Liberia also called for measures to be taken to resolve the issue of racism. He said that Liberia demands "the removal of the extremely offensive odor emanating from the seat occupied by the Union of South Africa in the United Nations."

    Representatives from some colonial countries such as the United States and Britain tried their best to defend racism in the discussion. British representative Crosthwaite insisted that the United Nations had no right to discuss the issue of racism in South Africa, and he demanded that the discussion on this issue be ended quickly. US representative McRoy opposed the United Nations taking strong measures to resolve the issue of racism. He admitted that in nearly two hundred years of American history, the United States itself has "never completely eliminated prejudice and stubbornness" on the issue of race.

    联大特别政委会讨论南非种族冲突问题
    许多国家代表强烈谴责种族主义
    新华社二日讯　纽约消息：联合国大会特别政治委员会目前正在讨论关于南非种族冲突的问题。许多国家代表在讨论中强烈谴责种族主义。
    这个问题曾经在联合国大会过去几届会议上讨论过，大会并且一再通过决议，要求南非联邦政府停止执行种族隔离政策，但是南非政府拒绝执行大会的决议。关于南非种族主义问题的联合国调查委员会在提交本届大会的报告中说，在过去一年中，虽然国际舆论普遍反对，南非政府推行种族隔离的总方针还是没有改变，它在种族问题上所采取的一系列立法措施不但同南非联邦根据联合国宪章所承担的义务相抵触，而且也同人权宣言的条款相抵触。报告指出，南非联邦执行的这种政策已经构成对这个国家国民生活的一个威胁。非洲人目前在南非联邦议会中还是没有代表权，他们不能在白种人从事的一些行业中找到工作，他们在教育和居住等问题上受到歧视。
    调查委员会主席智利代表圣克鲁斯发言说，在讨论南非种族冲突的问题时，应该重视世界舆论。他在这方面特别提到万隆亚非会议。他说，“在研究万隆会议的讨论中，调查委员会获得的最深刻的印象是种族歧视问题……触到了亚非自由人民心灵的深处。”要求种族平等是亚非人民根深蒂固的感情，“那些还没有获得充分权利的人民（要求平等）的压力是不可以遏制的，这些压力势将像火山一样爆发”。
    埃及代表马茂德指出：在万隆会议上，亚非国家一致谴责种族歧视。亚非国家要求结束这种歧视以恢复人类的尊严。联合国应该继续努力，以促进解决种族主义问题。
    伊拉克代表哈利迪说：“反对种族主义的运动已经生根，这个运动得到全世界大部分地区的支持。”他说，“世界上没有一个地方目前不在要求平等和公正的发展，这种觉醒是殖民主义的丧钟。”他指出，南非人民对种族歧视的反抗并不是可以靠飞机和机关枪镇压下去的。
    叙利亚代表道迪指出，种族隔离政策引起了流血冲突的危险。他建议成立一个调解委员会，来设法解决南非的种族冲突问题。
    利比里亚代表也要求采取措施来解决种族主义问题。他说，利比里亚要求“清除南非联邦从它在联合国所占有的席位发出来的极为难闻的气味”。
    美国、英国等一些殖民国家的代表在讨论中竭力为种族主义辩护。英国代表克罗斯威特硬说联合国无权讨论南非的种族主义问题，他要求赶快结束关于这个问题的讨论。美国代表麦罗反对联合国在解决种族主义问题上采取有力的措施，他承认：在美国将近二百年的历史中，美国自己在种族问题上“绝没有完全消除偏见和顽固”。
