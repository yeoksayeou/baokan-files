Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th: The General Council of Trade Unions of Japan ("Sohyo"), with over three million members, issued another statement on the 25th, opposing the United States bringing atomic weapons into Japan and establishing military bases in Japan. The statement also demanded that the United States withdraw its troops stationed in Japan.

　　In its statement, "Sohyo" pointed out that the United States bringing atomic weapons into Japan would only exacerbate tensions and threaten peace. The statement said that only when the United States removes its military bases in Japan and withdraws US troops stationed in Japan can Japan maintain its independence and peace be maintained.

　　The statement said that the presence of US troops in Japan would also lower the living standards of the Japanese people and cause social unrest because Japan is forced to pay a large sum to maintain the US troops.

　　In October, "Sohyo" wrote to Rannells protesting the United States bringing atomic weapons into Japan and expanding military bases in Japan. Rannells replied to "Sohyo" in a letter on November 25, describing these actions by the United States, which threaten peace in the Far East and harm Japanese interests, as "helping" Japan. After receiving this reply, "Sohyo" issued the above statement that evening.

　　日本“总评”发表声明
  　反对美国原子武器运日要求撤退驻日美军
    据新华社二十六日讯　东京消息：拥有三百多万会员的日本工会总评议会，在二十五日再一次发表声明，反对美国把原子武器运进日本和在日本建立军事基地。声明并且要求美国撤退驻在日本的军队。
      “总评”在声明中指出，美国把原子武器运进日本，只会加剧紧张局势，威胁和平。声明说，只有美国撤除在日本的军事基地、撤退驻在日本的美国军队，才能使日本保持独立，和平得以维护。
    声明说，美国军队驻在日本还会使日本人民的生活水平降低并且引起社会不安。因为日本被迫要付出很大的费用来维持美国军队。
    “总评”曾经在十月间写信给兰尼兹尔，抗议美国把原子武器运进日本和在日本扩建军事基地。兰尼兹尔在十一月二十五日写信答复“总评”，把美国这些威胁远东和平和危害日本利益的行为，说成是为了“帮助”日本。“总评”在接到这封复信后，当晚发表了上述声明。
