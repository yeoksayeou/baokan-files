　　Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The Prime Ministers' Conference of the Baghdad Pact participating countries was held in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, from the 21st to the 22nd.

　　The Prime Ministers and Premiers of Turkey, Iraq, Pakistan, and Iran, as well as a British delegation headed by British Foreign Secretary Macmillan, attended the conference. Also attending the conference were official observers from the United States—U.S. Ambassador to Baghdad, Gallman, and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, Admiral Cassady.

　　This conference decided to establish a permanent council and headquarters for the Baghdad Pact in Baghdad, including a secretariat and a permanent military committee. According to a communique issued after the meeting, the five foreign ministers will meet at least once a year. Each government will appoint a permanent representative at the ambassadorial level to the council. The representatives of the military committee will be the chiefs of staff of the five countries or their representatives.

　　According to the Associated Press, the establishment of a permanent military organization will allow member states to "combine in an organization like the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The report said that once this organization is established, "the Middle East will be linked to the Western North Atlantic Treaty Organization through Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and to the Eastern Southeast Asia Treaty Organization through Pakistan, a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization."

　　The report said that the conference also established an economic subcommittee to "coordinate mutual assistance and foreign aid."

　　The report said that the chief U.S. observer, U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Gallman, announced at the meeting that the United States would "establish permanent military and economic ties" with the Baghdad Pact. He has also designated an economic officer from the U.S. Embassy in Iraq as a liaison officer to the economic subcommittee. A communique issued after the meeting revealed that the United States has suggested organizing a U.S. political and military liaison group to be permanently stationed at the council.

　　After the meeting, British Foreign Secretary Macmillan immediately announced that he would go to Beirut to talk with the Lebanese government authorities. United Press International revealed that Baghdad "widely believes that his words are the first concrete step taken by the Baghdad Pact member states to draw other Arab countries into the organization."

　　巴格达条约参加国举行总理会议
    据新华社讯　巴格达条约参加国总理会议二十一日至二十二日在伊拉克的首都巴格达举行。
    参加会议的有土耳其、伊拉克、巴基斯坦和伊朗的总理和首相，以及以英国外交大臣麦克米伦为首的英国代表团。参加会议的还有美国官方的观察员——美国驻巴格达大使加尔曼和东大西洋及地中海美国海军总司令、海军上将卡赛迪。
    这次会议已经决定在巴格达建立一个巴格达条约常设理事会和总部，包括一个秘书处和常设军事委员会。据会后发表的公报说，五国外交部长的会议将每年至少举行一次。每个政府将任命一个大使级的常任代表驻在理事会。军事委员会的代表将是五国的参谋长或是他们的代表。
    据美联社透露，常设军事机构的成立将使成员国“在一个像北大西洋公约组织那样的组织中结合起来”。消息说，这个组织一经建立，“中东将通过北大西洋公约组织成员国土耳其同西方的北大西洋公约组织联系在一起，同时通过东南亚条约组织成员国巴基斯坦同东方的东南亚条约组织联系在一起”。
    消息说，这次会议还建立了一个经济小组委员会来“调配相互的援助和外国的援助”。
    消息说，美国首席观察员、美国驻伊拉克大使加尔曼在会议上宣布，美国同巴格达条约“建立永久的军事和经济的联系”。他并已指定美国驻伊拉克大使馆的一个经济官员为经济小组委员会的联络官。会后发表的公报透露，美国已经建议组织一个美国的政治和军事联络团，常驻在理事会。
    会议结束后，英国外交大臣麦克米伦立刻宣布，他要到贝鲁特去同黎巴嫩政府当局商谈。合众社透露，巴格达方面“广泛地认为他的话是巴格达条约成员国所采取的把其他阿拉伯国家拉入这个组织的第一个具体步骤”。
