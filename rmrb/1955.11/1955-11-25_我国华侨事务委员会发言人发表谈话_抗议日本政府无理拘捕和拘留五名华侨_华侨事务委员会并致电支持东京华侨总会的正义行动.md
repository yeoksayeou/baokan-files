Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd – A spokesman for the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China has issued a strong protest against the Japanese government's unreasonable arrest of Hong Jinshan, an overseas Chinese requesting to return to China, and the unreasonable continued detention of Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu, preventing them from freely returning to China.

The spokesman said: The Chinese government and the Chinese people have consistently provided various assistance and convenience to Japanese expatriates in China who wish to return to Japan. To address the difficulties faced by Japanese expatriates, the Chinese government and the Chinese Red Cross Society have also subsidized their travel expenses within China and allowed them to convert their savings into foreign currency to take back to Japan. However, the Japanese government has not taken corresponding measures for Chinese expatriates in Japan. Not long ago, the Japanese government forcibly transported more than 120 Chinese expatriates to Taiwan and beat those who refused to be forcibly transported to Taiwan. This time, the Japanese government unreasonably arrested and continued to detain Chinese expatriates requesting to return to China before their ships departed, which is intolerable to the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

The spokesman demanded that the Japanese government cease its unreasonable actions of obstructing Chinese expatriates in Japan from returning to their homeland and demanded that the Japanese government release Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu so that they can return to China according to their own wishes.

Xinhua News Agency, November 23rd – The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram to the Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association on November 23rd, supporting their just action of protesting the Japanese government's unreasonable arrest of Hong Jinshan, an overseas Chinese requesting to return to China. The text of the telegram is as follows: Tokyo Overseas Chinese General Association:

We support your just action of protesting the Japanese government's unreasonable arrest of Hong Jinshan, an overseas Chinese requesting to return to China. We have today protested to the Japanese government and demanded that the Japanese government release Hong Jinshan, Pan Guangkun, Guo Quanzao, Gu Minsheng, and Cai Jinxiu so that they can return to their homeland according to their own wishes.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 24th – The Japanese government's repeated unreasonable actions of obstructing overseas Chinese in Japan from returning to their homeland have aroused great indignation among overseas Chinese who have returned to China and are now in Tianjin.

Bai Qingzhi, an assistant engineer at the Tianjin Municipal State-Owned Fifth Machine Factory, returned to China from Japan in 1953. He believes that the Japanese government's unreasonable arrest and detention of overseas Chinese is an extremely unfriendly attitude and cannot but arouse indignation.

Li Tianxing, a technician at the Tianjin Municipal Labor Bureau's Machinist Training Class, workers Chen Baochen, Xu Yinrong, a technician at the First Machine Factory, and Shang Ai'yu, Liu Yueji, and Ling Benxing, students at the Second Middle School, also returned to China from Japan in 1953. They all expressed their support for the protest raised by the spokesman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission against the Japanese government's unreasonable actions in arresting overseas Chinese Hong Jinshan and others, and resolutely demanded that the Japanese government immediately release the five overseas Chinese including Hong Jinshan. They also expressed great anger at the Japanese government's forced transportation of more than 120 overseas Chinese to Taiwan. Chen Baochen said: "I am from Taiwan Province, and like my friends, none of us wants to go to Taiwan, but the Japanese government has violated the wishes of the overseas Chinese." Shang Ai'yu, Liu Yueji, and Ling Benxing demanded that the Japanese government guarantee that such unreasonable actions will not occur again in the future and guarantee that overseas Chinese can return to their homeland according to their own wishes.

　　我国华侨事务委员会发言人发表谈话
　　抗议日本政府无理拘捕和拘留五名华侨
　　华侨事务委员会并致电支持东京华侨总会的正义行动
    新华社二十三日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会发言人对日本政府无理地拘捕要求返回中国的华侨洪进山，和无理地继续拘留潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修等四名华侨，使他们不能够自由返回中国一事，提出严重抗议。
    发言人说：中国政府和中国人民对愿意返回日本的在中国的日本侨民，一贯地给以各种协助和方便。为了照顾日本侨民的困难，中国政府和中国红十字会并且补助他们在中国境内的旅费，容许他们将存款折成外汇携回日本。但是日本政府对在日本的中国侨民，并没有采取相应的措施。日本政府在不久以前，竟将一百二十余名中国侨民强迫运往台湾，并且对拒绝被强迫运往台湾的中国侨民加以殴打。这次日本政府更无理地将要求返回中国的中国侨民在船只开行之前，加以拘捕和继续加以拘留，这是中国政府和中国人民所绝不能容忍的。
    发言人要求日本政府停止阻挠中国在日侨民返回祖国的无理行动，并且要求日本政府释放洪进山、潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修等五名华侨，使他们能够按照本人的意愿返回中国。
    新华社二十三日讯　中华人民共和国华侨事务委员会二十三日打电报给东京华侨总会，支持他们抗议日本政府无理拘捕要求返国的侨胞洪进山的正义行动。电文如下：东京华侨总会：
    我们支持你们抗议日本政府无理拘捕要求返国的侨胞洪进山的正义行动。我们今日已向日本政府抗议，并且要求日本政府释放洪进山、潘广坤、郭全灶、顾敏生、蔡晋修等五名侨胞，使他们能够按照本人的意愿返回祖国。

    新华社天津二十四日电　日本政府一再阻难旅日华侨回国的无理行为，引起在天津的旅日回国华侨的极大愤慨。
    天津市地方国营第五机器厂助理工程师白清志是在一九五三年从日本回国的华侨。他认为日本政府无理地逮捕和拘留侨胞，是一种极不友好的态度，不能不令人愤慨。
    天津市劳动局机工训练班技术员李田兴、工人陈宝琛，第一机器厂技术员徐印荣和第二中学学生商爱钰、刘月姬、凌本幸等，也是一九五三年回国的旅日华侨。他们都表示拥护华侨事务委员会发言人对日本政府无理拘捕华侨洪进山等人的无理行动提出的抗议，并且坚决要求日本政府立即释放洪进山等五名华侨。他们对日本政府把一百二十多名华侨强迫运往台湾一事，也表示非常愤怒。陈宝琛说：“我是台湾省人，我和我的朋友一样，谁也不愿意到台湾去，但日本政府却违反了华侨的意愿。”商爱钰、刘月姬和凌本幸等要求日本政府保证今后不再发生这种无理行动，保证华侨能够按照本人的意愿返回祖国。
