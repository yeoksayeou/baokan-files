China Writers Association Formulates Plan to Develop Children's and Juvenile Literature Creation

　　At its recent 14th Presidium Meeting (Enlarged Session) of the Council, the China Writers Association discussed and adopted a plan for developing children's and juvenile literature creation, and issued instructions to local branches of the Writers Association regarding the development of children's and juvenile literature creation.

　　In the plan regarding the development of children's and juvenile literature creation, it was decided to organize member writers engaged in creation and translation work in Beijing and the provinces of North China to write or translate at least one piece (or work) of children's and juvenile literature before the end of June 1956. Member writers engaged in theoretical criticism work will write at least one research article related to children's and juvenile literature before the end of 1956. This group of writers includes Guo Moruo, Mao Dun, Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Lao She, Feng Xuefeng, Xia Yan, Tian Han, Cao Yu, Liu Baiyu, Zhou Libo, Zhao Shuli, Ai Qing, Huang Yaomian, He Qifang, and others, totaling more than 190 people. In addition, local branches of the Writers Association will organize local creative forces to complete more than 100 pieces of children's and juvenile literature works and theoretical criticism articles before the end of 1956. The plan also stipulates that sixteen writers participating in the Children's and Juvenile Literature Group of the China Writers Association's Creation Committee, including Ye Shengtao, Zhang Tianyi, Xie Bingxin, and Gao Shiqi, will write at least one work before the end of this year, and at least three works in 1956. The plan also specifies concrete measures to strengthen the leadership of children's and juvenile literature creation and to cultivate new forces in children's and juvenile literature creation.

　　In the instructions issued to local branches of the China Writers Association, it was said: "Developing children's and juvenile literature creation is an extremely urgent task related to the spiritual food of 120 million children and young people, and it is necessary to resolutely and systematically change the current situation of extreme lack of children's and juvenile literature reading materials." The instructions require local branches of the Writers Association to include the issue of developing children's and juvenile literature in their regular work agenda, actively organize children's and juvenile literature creation, organize and expand the ranks of children's and juvenile literature, and strengthen ideological leadership over children's and juvenile literature creation.

　　The instructions state: "The content of children's and juvenile literature works should educate children and young people with the spirit of communism and cultivate their new virtues. The themes should be diverse, as long as the content described and the ideological emotions expressed can be understood and loved by children and young people, and can inspire their imagination and wisdom, or enrich their historical and life knowledge, they should be welcomed. Special attention should be paid to cultivating the rich imagination, firm will, and courageous spirit of children and young people." The instructions also state: "It is necessary to advocate cooperation between writers and scientists and historical researchers to write some lively and interesting scientific and literary reading materials, biographies of famous people in China and the world, etc. The forms and genres of works should be rich and diverse, and novels, stories, poems, scripts, fairy tales, folk legends, science fiction stories, adventure novels, travelogues, and other styles should be universally developed."

　　Publishing Agencies for Children's Reading Materials Increase New Book Varieties and Print Runs

　　The Children's Publishing House under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League plans to publish 1,350 types of children's and juvenile reading materials next year, including 403 new books, an increase of 146 types compared to this year's new book plan indicators; 947 types of reprinted books will be printed; the initial and reprint editions will total approximately 40 million copies. In terms of organizing manuscripts, the focus will be on the creation of children's and juvenile literature, but attention will also be paid to literary and artistic science knowledge reading materials, biographies of revolutionary leaders and model figures, Chinese classical literature, various recreational activity sports game materials, learning books, and holiday assignments.

　　In order to enhance publishing strength and expand the publication volume of children's and juvenile reading materials, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League is preparing to establish the China Children's Publishing House in Beijing.

　　The publishing department plans to increase the number of newly published national children's and juvenile reading materials (including comic books) by 25 percent each year for the next two years, and to increase the number of initial and reprint editions by 20 percent each year. In this way, the number of initial editions of general children's and juvenile reading materials and comic books in 1956 can reach approximately 1,150 types, with approximately 2,550 types in initial and reprint editions, and a print run of 72 million copies; in 1957, the number of initial editions of general children's and juvenile reading materials and comic books can reach approximately 1,440 types, with approximately 2,840 types in initial and reprint editions, and a print run of 86 million copies.

　　Xinhua Bookstore Instructs Local Branches to Improve the Distribution of Children's Reading Materials

　　At the end of September, the General Store of Xinhua Bookstore issued instructions to stores and distribution offices at all levels, requiring its affiliated stores at all levels to pay attention to the criticisms in the Party newspaper, quickly reverse the serious phenomenon of extreme scarcity of children's and juvenile reading materials, and conscientiously implement the policy of distributing large quantities of children's and juvenile reading materials as pointed out in the "People's Daily" editorial. The General Store of Xinhua Bookstore also proposed concrete arrangements to immediately start improving the situation in the fourth quarter of this year, requiring children's reading material specialty stores in large and medium-sized cities to increase the variety of books as much as possible, and to fully stock relatively excellent children's and juvenile reading materials; comprehensive stores should set up special counters and shelves for children's reading materials; stores in small cities should also display or classify children's reading materials separately. The General Store of Xinhua Bookstore also instructed the Shanghai Distribution Office to compile and print a catalog of children's reading materials before the end of October, and widely distribute it to schools, cultural centers (stations), libraries, and parents to expand publicity. It also stipulated that the work of publicizing and recommending children's and juvenile reading materials should be a regular task of Xinhua Bookstores in various places. The General Store of Xinhua Bookstore also required all store personnel to fully recognize the importance of strengthening the distribution of children's and juvenile reading materials, criticize the bad tendency of not caring about the needs of children and young people, and overcome the capitalist business ideology of underestimating children's and juvenile reading materials. Until recently, the journal "Book Distribution" compiled and printed by the General Store of Xinhua Bookstore has continuously published articles by the heads of Xinhua Bookstores in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as staff members of branch stores in Henan, Heilongjiang, and other places. They have all reviewed their past tendencies to neglect the distribution of children's and juvenile reading materials and proposed concrete measures to improve their work.

　　中国作家协会在最近召开的第十四次理事会主席团会议（扩大）上，讨论通过了关于发展少年儿童文学创作的计划，并向作家协会各地分会发出关于发展少年儿童文学创作的指示。
    在关于发展少年儿童文学创作的计划中，决定组织在北京和在华北各省的从事创作、翻译工作的会员作家在一九五六年六月底以前，每人至少写出或翻译一篇（部）少年儿童文学作品，从事理论批评工作的会员作家在一九五六年年底以前，每人至少写出一篇有关少年儿童文学的有研究性的文章。这一批作家中包括郭沫若、茅盾、周扬、丁玲、老舍、冯雪峰、夏衍、田汉、曹禺、刘白羽、周立波、赵树理、艾青、黄药眠、何其芳等共一百九十多人。此外，由作家协会各地分会组织当地创作力量，在一九五六年年底前，完成一百多篇的少年儿童文学作品和理论批评文章。计划还规定参加中国作家协会创作委员会少年儿童文学组的叶圣陶、张天翼、谢冰心、高士其等十六位作家，在今年年底前，至少写出一篇作品，在一九五六年内至少写出三篇作品。计划还规定了加强对少年儿童文学创作的领导和培养少年儿童文学创作的新生力量的具体办法。
    中国作家协会向各地分会发出的指示中说：发展少年儿童文学创作，是关系着一亿二千万少年儿童的精神食粮的极其迫切的任务，必须坚决地有计划地改变目前少年儿童文学读物十分缺乏的状况。指示要求作家协会各地分会把发展少年儿童文学的问题列入自己经常的工作日程，积极组织少年儿童文学创作，组织并扩大少年儿童文学队伍，并加强对少年儿童文学创作的思想领导。
    指示中说：少年儿童文学作品的内容应当以共产主义精神教育少年儿童，培养他们新的品德。题材应当是多方面的，只要所描写的内容、所表现的思想感情能为少年儿童理解和喜爱，并且是能启发少年儿童的想像和智慧的，或者能丰富少年儿童历史和生活知识的，都应当欢迎。特别应当注意培养少年儿童丰富的想像力，坚定的意志和勇敢的精神。指示还说：应当提倡作家和科学家、历史研究者合作，为少年儿童写一些生动有趣的科学文艺读物、中国和世界的名人传记等。作品的形式和体裁应当丰富多样，要普遍发展小说、故事、诗歌、剧本、童话、民间传说、科学幻想故事、惊险小说、游记等样式。
　　少年儿童读物出版机关增加新书品种和印数
    青年团中央领导的少年儿童出版社计划明年出版少年儿童读物一三五○种，内新书四○三种，比今年出版新书计划指标增加一四六种；印行重版书九四七种；初版重版共约印四千万册。在组织稿件方面，以少年儿童文学创作为主，同时也注意文艺性的科学知识读物、革命领袖模范人物传记、中国古典文学、各种文娱活动体育游戏材料及学习用书、假期作业等。
    为了增强出版力量，扩大少年儿童读物的出版量，青年团中央筹备在北京成立中国少年儿童出版社。
    出版部门计划在今后两年中，使全国少年儿童读物（包括连环画在内）的新出版的种数逐年增加百分之二十五，初重版印数逐年增加百分之二十。这样，一九五六年初版一般少年儿童读物和连环画的种数约可达一、一五○种，初重版共计约二、五五○种，印数可达七、二○○万册；一九五七年初版一般少年儿童读物和连环画种数约可达一、四四○种，初重版共计约二、八四○种，印数可达八、六○○万册。

    新华书店总店在九月底就对各级店、发行所发出指示，要求所属各级店重视党报的批评，迅速扭转目前少年儿童读物奇缺的严重现象，认真贯彻
  “人民日报”社论所指出的大量发行少年儿童读物的方针。新华书店总店并提出在今年第四季度立即着手改进的具体布置，要求在大、中城市店的儿童读物专门门市部尽量增加书籍品种，比较优良的少年儿童读物要充分备货；综合门市部应设立少年儿童读物的专台、专柜；小城市的店也应将少年儿童读物单独陈列或分类。新华书店总店并责成上海发行所在十月底前编印一个少年儿童读物目录，向各学校、文化馆（站）、图书馆、家长广为散发，扩大宣传。并将宣传推荐少年儿童读物的工作，规定为各地新华书店的经常任务。新华书店总店还要求全店人员充分认识加强少年儿童读物发行工作的重要性，批判不关心少年儿童需要的恶劣倾向，克服轻视少年儿童读物的资本主义经营思想。到最近为止，新华书店总店编印的期刊“图书发行”上，已连续登载了北京、上海两地新华书店负责人及河南、黑龙江等地支店工作人员的文章，他们对过去忽视少年儿童读物发行工作的倾向都作了检讨，并提出改进工作的具体措施。
