To increase the production of oil crops, peasants in various parts of Jiangxi Province are actively reclaiming barren Camellia oleifera forests. The province plans to reclaim more than 990,000 mu of Camellia oleifera forests this year. As of late October, 400,000 mu of barren Camellia oleifera forests have been reclaimed. Yujiang, Xingguo, and other counties have basically completed the task of reclaiming Camellia oleifera forests. After realizing the great significance of developing Camellia oleifera, tea farmers in mountainous areas of Yushan and Hengfeng counties have actively formulated plans to reclaim barren Camellia oleifera mountains. Three agricultural cooperatives in Houye Township, Huaiyu District, Yushan County, plan to reclaim 800 mu of Camellia oleifera mountains and prepare to replant 250 mu of Camellia oleifera. Yuanbian and Lingxia Townships in Linhu District have formulated a plan to reclaim 3,000 mu of Camellia oleifera mountains. Many agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups have actively invested in the reclamation of Camellia oleifera mountains. According to preliminary statistics, the county can reclaim 26,500 mu of Camellia oleifera mountains. To strengthen technical guidance, the county's Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Section has dispatched technical personnel to the mountainous areas to guide tea farmers in reclamation work. Hengfeng Huangcun, Yamada, and other three townships have recently issued a loan for Camellia oleifera reclamation to help tea farmers develop oil crop production. It is estimated that after the province's Camellia oleifera reclamation plan is completed this year, the province will increase tea oil production by more than 27,000 dan next year.

    江西农民积极垦复油茶林
    为了增产油料作物，江西省各地农民积极垦复荒芜的油茶林。全省今年计划垦复油茶林九十九万多亩，截至十月下旬，全省荒芜的油茶林已垦复了四十万亩。余江、兴国等县已基本上完成了油茶林垦复任务。玉山、横峰县山区的茶农认识了发展油茶重大意义后，积极订出了垦复荒芜油茶山的计划。玉山县怀玉区后业乡三个农业合作社，计划垦复油茶山八百亩，并准备补种油茶二百五十亩。临湖区院边、岭下两个乡订出了垦复油茶山三千亩计划，许多农业合作社、互助组都已积极投入垦复油茶山活动。据初步统计全县可垦复油茶山二万六千五百亩。为了加强技术指导，该县农林水利科已派出技术人员深入山区，领导茶农进行垦复工作。横峰篁村、山田等三个乡，最近发放了一笔油茶垦复贷款，帮助茶农发展油料作物生产。预计全省今年油茶垦复计划完成后，明年全省将要增产茶油二万七千多担。　（本报驻南昌记者）
