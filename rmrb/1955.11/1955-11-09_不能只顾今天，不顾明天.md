    Cannot Focus Only on Today, Ignoring Tomorrow

    As in previous years, the lagging of tunneling work behind coal mining work in the coal industry becomes particularly noticeable at the end of the year. According to materials provided by the Northeast Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry: From January to September this year, the tunneling work of major shafts in the entire bureau only completed 88.5 percent of the original plan. Among them, the Liaoyuan and Tonghua Mining Bureaus only completed a little more than half. 48 percent of the pit entrances in the entire bureau had less than six months of recoverable coal reserves, and 19 percent had less than three months. For example, the Fuguo West No. 2 pit in Liaoyuan Mining Bureau only had nine days of recoverable coal reserves left by the end of September.
    Tunneling prepares the working areas for coal mining. According to national regulations, each pit entrance should always maintain six to ten months of recoverable coal reserves to ensure the continuous progress of coal mining work. If tunneling work falls behind, there is a risk of interrupting coal mining work. Last year, Shuangyashan Mining Bureau was forced to reduce production by 200,000 tons of coal due to lagging tunneling. The Fuguo No. 2 pit of Liaoyuan Mining Bureau was also forced to stop coal mining for about a month after the coal seam spontaneously combusted because the tunneling work was not prepared. These lessons are profound.
    Why hasn't the situation of lagging tunneling work changed? This is mainly because some leading staff in coal mining enterprises have not placed tunneling work in an equally important position as coal mining work. At mine scheduling meetings, they only check the completion of coal mining plans and not the tunneling work. Some leaders also only check coal mining work when they go down the mine to inspect work, and not tunneling work. In the fourth quarter of last year, the Chengzihe Mine of Jixi Mining Bureau did not complete either coal mining or tunneling tasks, but the leading staff of this mine only focused on coal mining. As a result, the tunneling plan was completed very poorly, making this year's production work very passive. Until now, neither the tunneling nor coal mining plans have been completed. Under these circumstances, they are now saying they want to simply abandon tunneling and concentrate on coal mining. The fundamental reason for the "emphasize mining, neglect tunneling" attitude is that some coal mine leaders lack comprehensive planning, and only deal with whatever is pressing and unavoidable. They think, "We can't even get through today, how can we take care of tomorrow?" In order to "get through" today and produce more coal, they are selective in tunneling, first tunneling thick coal seams and then thin ones, first tunneling easy ones and then difficult but very important roadways. Some mines even deliberately expand the tunneling face of coal roadways or add unnecessary roadways in areas with good coal seams in order to temporarily mine more coal. On the surface, it seems to kill two birds with one stone: completing tunneling figures and producing more coal. But in reality, this hinders both tunneling and coal mining. The reason is that not tunneling roadways according to a comprehensive plan will hinder the planned and full exploitation of the country's resources and will cause long-term inconvenience to coal mining work. This means that the practice of focusing on being good today but not caring about tomorrow will make many future "todays" bad.
    At the end of the year, the leaders of some mines are even more likely to relax their inspection of tunneling work in order to rush coal production. In order not to delay the normal production of coal next year, and to meet the country's growing need for coal production, it is necessary to quickly reverse the current situation in some mines where tunneling work lags behind coal mining work.

    不能只顾今天，不顾明天
    陆灏
    像往年一样，煤炭工业的掘进工作落后于采煤工作的情况，到年底就格外显著。根据煤炭工业部东北煤矿管理局所提供的材料：今年一月到九月，全局主要井巷的掘进工作只完成原计划的百分之八十八点五，其中辽源、通化两矿务局，只完成一半多一点。全局有百分之四十八的坑口的获得煤量不足六个月，有百分之十九的坑口的获得煤量不足三个月。像辽源矿务局的富国西二坑，到九月底，只剩下了九天的获得煤量。
    掘进是为采煤准备工作场地的。按照国家的规定，每一个坑口应该经常保持有六个月到十个月的获得煤量，才能保证采煤工作连续进行。要是掘进工作落后了，采煤工作就有中断的危险。双鸭山矿务局去年由于掘进落后于采煤，被迫减产二十万吨煤。辽源矿务局的富国二坑，也因为掘进工作没有准备好，采煤场子自然发火后，被迫停止采煤约一个月。这些教训是很深刻的。
    为什么掘进工作落后的情况还没有改变呢？这主要是有些煤矿企业的领导工作人员没有把掘进工作摆在跟采煤工作一样重要的地位。他们在矿山调度会议上，只检查采煤计划的完成情况，而不检查掘进工作情况。有的领导人员下井检查工作，也只检查采煤工作，而不检查掘进工作。鸡西矿务局城子河矿在去年第四季度的时候，采煤和掘进的任务都没有完成，但是这个矿的领导工作人员只抓采煤工作。结果掘进计划完成得很不好，致使今年的生产工作非常被动，直到现在，掘进和采煤计划都没有完成。在这种情况下，他们现在又表示要干脆放下掘进，集中采煤。产生“重采轻掘”的根本原因，就是有些煤矿的领导工作人员，缺乏通盘的筹划，什么事情追得紧，什么事情躲不过去，就应付什么事情。他们认为“今天还过不去，那里还能照顾明天？”为了今天“过得去”，为了多出煤，就在掘进中挑肥丢瘦，先掘煤厚层，后掘煤薄层，先掘容易掘的，后掘有困难但非常重要的巷道。有的矿坑为了暂时采得更多的煤炭，在煤层好的地方，还故意扩大煤炭巷道的掘进面，或者增加一些不必要的巷道。从表面上看，好像是一举两得：既完成了掘进数字，又多出了煤炭。但是实际上，这既妨碍掘进，又妨碍采煤。原因是不按全面规划掘进巷道，就会妨碍有计划地充分地开采祖国资源，就会造成采煤工作的长远的不方便。这就是说，为了今天好过而不顾明天的做法，就会使以后许多个“今天”不好过。
    在年末的时候，有些矿井的领导者更容易为赶采煤产量而放松对掘进工作的检查。为了不耽误明年的煤炭的正常生产，为了满足国家对于煤炭生产的日益增长的需要，必须迅速扭转目前一些矿井掘进工作落后于采煤工作的局面。
