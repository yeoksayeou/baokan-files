    Actively Mobilize Women to Participate in the Agricultural Cooperativization Movement

    The mass movement for agricultural cooperativization is reaching a climax throughout the country. The development and victory of this movement signifies a complete change in the historical destiny and life path of China's five hundred million peasants, and at the same time, it signifies the complete liberation of the vast rural women, who account for half of the rural population.

    After the land reform and other democratic reforms, the vast rural women in our country have achieved complete equality with men in politics and law, which is something that women in any capitalist country touting freedom and democracy have not actually achieved. However, because the small-scale private economy based on small private ownership still occupies a large advantage in our country, most rural women are still completely bound to scattered and fragmented household labor, are not economically independent, cannot fully develop their talents, and their status in the family and society is actually not completely equal to that of men. Where is the path for women to seek their own complete liberation? On this question, Engels said in "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State": "The emancipation of women becomes possible only when women are enabled to take part in production on a large, social scale, and when domestic duties require their attention only to a minor degree." Stalin more specifically pointed out at the First All-Union Congress of Collective Farm Shock Workers: Women "can only obtain a position equal to that of men in the collective farm. Without collective farms, there is no equality." That is to say, only by carrying out socialist transformation of agriculture, changing private ownership, and enabling women to participate in social labor and achieve complete economic independence can women's own complete liberation and true equality between men and women be realized.

    The facts in our country are also like this. In recent years, with the continuous development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, millions of women in our country have joined agricultural production cooperatives of a semi-socialist nature with men, and have participated in collective and social labor and related activities. They have gained a lot of knowledge in the cooperativization movement and collective labor, and have learned various production skills. They are beginning to show that they are a strong social and labor force. Whatever men can do, they can do too. In agricultural production cooperatives in Henan Province, a major cotton and tobacco producing area in our country, the technical management of cotton and tobacco has basically been completely taken over by women. The cooperative's sideline businesses such as raising chickens and pigs are also mostly run by female members. In the agricultural cooperative led by the famous labor model Xin Zixiu, the income from sideline businesses of raising chickens and pigs by female members reached more than 20,000 yuan in 1954. In the First Agricultural Cooperative of Dongwengenshan Village, Tailai County, Heilongjiang Province, thirteen female members participated in various labors, saving male labor and expanding the cultivated land by thirty hectares. In the agricultural cooperative led by Li Yeli, a famous female labor model in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, female labor accounted for 50 percent of the total labor of the cooperative. Last year, all members of the cooperative completed more than 52,000 work points, of which women completed more than 21,000 work points. Due to the mobilization of a large number of women to participate in cooperative labor, this cooperative completed various tasks such as spring plowing, summer harvest, and autumn harvest ahead of schedule last year. Not only that, but a large number of female leading cadres have emerged on the front line of agricultural cooperativization, and they are unashamedly shouldering the task of organizers and leaders of cooperatives. According to statistics from 4,131 agricultural production cooperatives in 57 counties and 10 suburban districts in Jiangsu Province, 421 women serve as chairpersons or vice-chairpersons, and 3,170 women serve as committee members. In the 123 cooperatives established in Lushan County, Henan Province before the autumn harvest in 1954, each cooperative had a female chairperson or vice-chairperson. As a result, their status in the family and society has completely changed: they were formerly slaves to simple and tedious housework, and now they have become truly free citizens; they were formerly simple "helpers" and appendages of men, and now they have become true social and labor members equal to men. The abuse of them by mothers-in-law and husbands has turned into respect, and the contempt of them in society has turned into sincere praise.

    We must use these truths and facts to educate all rural women, so that they understand the relationship between the complete liberation of women themselves and the cause of agricultural cooperativization, thereby continuously improving their socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for the cooperativization movement. At the same time, we must also use these facts to educate all working farmers, so that they understand the position and role of women, who account for half of the population, in the agricultural cooperativization movement and the agricultural production increase movement. We must thoroughly correct all erroneous views on women, and take all necessary active measures in the process of large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives and even in handling various issues related to female members of agricultural production cooperatives, so that women can play their due huge role.

    The active measures mentioned here include the following important aspects:

    First, in the process of establishing cooperatives, adhere to the principle of mobilizing both men and women together. After the establishment of the cooperative, women should be involved in all important activities in the cooperative, such as assessing the output of land for joining the cooperative, stipulating the remuneration for land and labor, stipulating private plots, the feeding and management and lease or discounted return of draft animals to the cooperative, as well as discussing production investment, agricultural tool shares, profit distribution, formulating cooperative regulations, and discussing the cooperative's production plans and various systems, and women should be educated to fully exercise their democratic rights. The purpose of doing this is to improve female members' understanding of policies and enable women to learn various knowledge and handling abilities. This is of great benefit to the consolidation and development of the cooperative.

    Second, seize the training of a large number of female activists who have emerged in the large-scale development of agricultural cooperatives, so that they can lead the broad masses of rural women to take the road of cooperativization. Local Party committees should have a certain number of female activists when uniformly training construction backbones and improving old backbones. Local women's federations should assist the Party committees in doing a good job in the selection and training of female backbones. In the production process after the establishment of the cooperative, attention should also be paid to cultivating those female backbones who are active in production and work, and promoting them to the leading positions of the cooperative.

    When organizing women to participate in the cooperative's labor production, attention should also be paid to solving the following specific problems:

    First, implement the issue of equal pay for equal work for men and women. The Central Committee of our Party said in the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives": "Men and women labor should be paid the same remuneration according to the quality and quantity of work (for example: in the same type of work, if women do as much and as good work as men, their remuneration must be equal to that of men; if their labor exceeds that of men, their remuneration should also exceed it accordingly. If their labor is not as good as men or only reaches half of it, their remuneration should also be reduced accordingly)." This principle is of great significance for giving play to women's enthusiasm for participating in cooperative production labor. However, to this day, there are still some agricultural cooperatives that have varying degrees of unequal pay for equal work for men and women. Some cadres and farmers stubbornly believe that "women can't catch up with men no matter what." They deliberately lower the base scores for women in scoring, generally defining women as semi-laborers, or rigidly stipulating that the highest score for men is eight points a day, and for women is five points. Sometimes, if the labor effect of women exceeds that of men, they cannot be given extra points because "there are only so many base points." This makes some women have low labor morale, and even clamor to withdraw from the cooperative. The unity between male and female members is also affected by this. This problem must be reasonably solved.

    Second, the issue of rational allocation and use of female labor. Some cooperatives, because they have more male labor, coupled with the feudal remnants of thought that cadres or members have more men than women, do not take active measures to use the surplus labor to develop production, but exclude women and restrict women from participating in labor when allocating and using labor. Some areas force women to take on labor that is not suitable for women, which affects women's health and their confidence in participating in production. In the future, all cooperatives must include the total number of male and female labor in the cooperative in a unified calculation, and according to the physical strength and expertise of women, properly divide labor and assign industries, and assign tasks that are suitable for women to undertake. Only in this way can women's concerns be eliminated and their enthusiasm and confidence in participating in cooperative production activities be improved.

    Third, the issue of planned assistance to women in learning production technology. In this regard, many cooperatives have already made remarkable achievements, but there are still some cooperatives that have not paid serious attention to it. In the future, it is necessary to organize women to learn the agricultural production technology that they can handle physically and that is necessary, according to the needs of various production seasons and various production labors, so that they can participate in more production labor and play a greater role in production.

    Fourth, the issue of helping women overcome specific difficulties. After women generally participate in agricultural and sideline production, the problem of daily housework and childcare has become an increasingly common problem. Many women cannot concentrate on production because their children are not properly cared for, and housework such as cooking and washing are not arranged well. These specific difficulties must be seriously resolved. It is necessary to educate and help women find ways to do both production and housework well. When arranging women's production tasks, they should be given a certain amount of time for housework. In terms of childcare, various places have adopted methods of mutual assistance between relatives and neighbors, individual entrustment, or the formation of temporary childcare groups composed of elderly women, or mothers with children taking turns to look after children, which are all simple and feasible methods. In addition, cooperatives should also take care of pregnant women to prevent miscarriages. For mothers with breastfeeding children, they should be assigned tasks that are closer to home.

    In order to welcome and organize the upsurge of the agricultural cooperativization movement, Party organizations at all levels must conscientiously strengthen the leadership of women's work, adhere to the principle of mobilizing both men and women together, and uniformly deploy, inspect, and summarize women's work. Cadres of women's federations at all levels must conscientiously study the resolutions of the Party Central Committee on agricultural cooperativization and Comrade Mao Zedong's report "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperation" and other relevant important documents. Women's federations at all levels should, under the unified leadership of the Party, select key points, create typical experiences, promote the general, and work better in mobilizing and organizing women to participate in the cooperativization movement and the production increase movement, according to the planning of the Party committees.

### 积极发动妇女参加农业合作化运动

    积极发动妇女参加农业合作化运动
    农业合作化的群众运动，正在全国范围内走向高潮。这一运动的发展和胜利，意味着我国五亿农民的历史命运和生活道路的彻底改变，同时也意味着占农村人口半数的广大农村妇女的彻底解放。
    我国广大农村妇女经过土地改革和其他民主改革，她们在政治上和法律上取得了同男子完全平等的地位，这是任何标榜自由民主的资本主义国家的妇女所实际上不曾取得的。但是由于以小私有制为基础的小农经济在我们国家还占着很大的优势，所以大多数农村妇女至今仍然完全被束缚在分散细碎的家庭劳动中，经济上不能独立，聪明才智不能充分发挥，她们在家庭中和社会上的地位实际上也不能同男子完全平等。妇女们谋取自身彻底解放的道路在哪儿呢？关于这一问题，恩格斯在“家族、私有财产及国家之起源”中说：“妇女底解放，乃以一切女性底重行参加社会劳动为其头一个先决条件。而要达到这个地步，又非使个体家族不复再是社会经济单位不可。”斯大林在第一次全苏联集体农庄突击队员代表大会上的演说中更具体指出：妇女们“只有在集体农庄里面才有可能获得与男子平等的地位。没有集体农庄，就没有平等”。这就是说，只有对农业实行社会主义改造，改变私有制，使妇女参加社会劳动，在经济上取得完全独立的地位，妇女自身的彻底解放和真正的男女平等才能实现。
    我国的事实也正是这样。几年来，随着农业合作化运动的不断发展，我国已经有千百万妇女同男子一道参加了半社会主义性质的农业生产合作社，参加了集体的社会的劳动和有关的其他活动。她们在合作化运动和集体的劳动中增长了许多知识，学会了各种生产技能。她们开始表现出自己是一支强大的社会力量和劳动力量。凡是男子所能作的，她们也都能作。我国主要棉烟产区河南省的农业生产合作社里，棉花和烟叶的技术管理工作，已经基本上全部由妇女去做。社里养鸡、喂猪等副业，也大都由女社员经营。著名劳动模范辛自修领导的农业合作社里，女社员们在一九五四年养鸡喂猪的副业收入达到两万多元。黑龙江省泰来县东翁根山村第一农业合作社有十三名女社员参加各项劳动，节省出男劳动力，扩大了耕地三十垧。江西永新县著名女劳动模范李页俚领导的农业合作社中，妇女劳动力占全社总劳动力百分之五十。去年全社社员共做了五万二千多个劳动工分，其中妇女所做的有两万一千多工分。由于发动了大批妇女参加社内劳动，这个合作社去年提前完成了春耕、夏收、秋收等各种任务。不仅如此，在农业合作化的战线上，还出现了大批妇女领导骨干，她们毫无愧色地担当着合作社的组织者和领导者的任务。据江苏省五十七个县和十个市郊区的四千一百三十一个农业生产合作社的统计，妇女担任正副社长的有四百二十一人，担任社务委员的有三千一百七十人。河南省鲁山县一九五四年秋收前建立的一百二十三个合作社中，每个社都有女社长或副社长。这一来，她们在家庭中和社会上的地位完全改变了：以前她们是单纯的繁琐家务的奴隶，现在她们成了真正自由的公民；以前她们是男子的简单“内助”和附属品，现在她们成了真正同男子平等的社会成员和劳动成员。公婆丈夫对她们的虐待变成了尊敬，社会上对她们的轻视变成了真心的赞扬。
    我们必须用这些道理和事实教育所有的农村妇女，使她们了解妇女自身的彻底解放同农业合作化事业的关系，从而不断地提高她们的社会主义觉悟和对于合作化运动的热情。同时，我们也必须用这些事实教育所有的劳动农民，使他们了解占人口半数的妇女在农业合作化运动和农业增产运动中的地位和作用。我们要彻底纠正对妇女的各种错误看法，并在大规模发展农业生产合作社的过程中以至处理农业生产合作社有关女社员的各种问题上，采取一切必要的积极措施，使妇女发挥应有的巨大作用。
    这里所说的积极措施，包括以下几个重要的方面：
    第一、在建社过程中，坚持男女一齐发动的方针。建社以后，在社内各项重要活动中，比如评定入社土地产量，规定土地和劳力的报酬，规定自留地，耕畜的饲养管理和租用或者折价归社，以及讨论生产投资、农具入股、收益分配、制定社章，讨论社的生产计划和各项制度中，都应该吸收妇女参加，并教育妇女充分运用自己的民主权利。这样作的目的，是为了提高女社员对于政策的了解，使妇女学习各种知识和办事能力。这对于合作社的巩固和发展都有很大好处。
    第二、抓紧培养训练农业合作社大发展中涌现出来的大量女积极分子，使她们带动广大农村妇女群众走合作化道路。各地党委在统一集训建社骨干和提高老社骨干时，应该有一定名额的妇女积极分子。各地妇联应该协助党委做好妇女骨干的挑选和培养工作。在建社以后的生产过程中，也应该注意培养那些生产积极、工作积极的妇女骨干，提拔她们到合作社的领导岗位上来。
    在组织妇女参加社内劳动生产的时候，还应该注意解决以下具体问题：
    一是贯彻男女同工同酬的问题。我党中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”中说：“男女劳动力应该按照工作的质量和数量，实行同样的报酬（例如：在同一工种中，妇女如果和男人做同样多和同样好的工，她所得的报酬必须是和男人相等的；劳动超过男人的，报酬也照样超过。劳动比不上男人或只达到一半的，报酬也照样减少）。”这一原则，对于发挥妇女参加社内生产劳动的积极性关系十分重大。但是至今仍然有一些农业合作社程度不同地存在着男女同工不同酬的现象。部分干部和农民固执地认为“妇女怎样也赶不上男人”。他们在评分中故意压低妇女的底分，把妇女普遍定为半劳动力，或者硬性规定男的最高一天八分，女的五分。有时妇女劳动效果超过了男子，也因“底分只有那么多”而不能加分。这就使得有些妇女劳动情绪不高，甚至吵着要退社。男女社员之间的团结也因此受到影响。这一问题必须求得合理的解决。
    二是合理分配和使用妇女劳动力的问题。有一些合作社因为男劳动力较多，加上干部或社员中有重男轻女的封建残余思想，所以他们不是采取积极措施来使用多余的劳动力，发展生产，而是在分配和使用劳动力时排斥妇女，限制妇女参加劳动。有些地区强求妇女担任不适合于妇女的劳动，影响了妇女的健康和她们参加生产的信心。今后一切合作社都必须把全社男女劳动力统一计算在内，按照妇女的体力和特长，适当分工分业，把适宜于妇女担负的任务分配给她们担负。这样才能消除妇女们的顾虑，提高她们参加合作社生产活动的热情和信心。
    三是有计划地帮助妇女学习生产技术的问题。在这一方面，许多合作社已经做出了显著的成绩，但也还有一些社没有认真注意。今后必须根据各个生产季节各种生产劳动的需要，有计划地组织妇女学习她们体力所能胜任的和必要的农业生产技术，使她们能够参加更多的生产劳动，在生产中发挥更大的作用。
    四是帮助妇女克服具体困难的问题。在妇女普遍参加农副业生产以后，日常家务劳动和照顾孩子的问题日益成为普遍性的问题。有许多妇女因为孩子得不到妥善照顾，做饭和缝洗等家务安排不好，因而不能安心生产。这些具体困难必须认真解决。要教育和帮助妇女想办法做到生产家务两不误。在安排妇女的生产任务时，要给她们留出一定的家务劳动时间。照顾孩子的问题，各地采用了亲邻相帮，个别寄托的办法；或者是由老年妇女组成农忙托儿组；或者是由有孩子的母亲轮流看孩子，这些办法都简易可行。此外，合作社对于孕妇也应该加以照顾，防止造成流产。对于有吃奶小孩的母亲，应该分配给离家较近的任务。
    为了迎接和组织农业合作化运动的高潮，各级党组织必须认真加强对妇女工作的领导，坚持贯彻男女一起发动的方针，统一布置、检查并总结妇女工作。各级民主妇联的干部必须认真学习党中央关于农业合作化问题的决议和毛泽东同志“关于农业合作化问题”的报告以及有关的重要文件。各级妇联组织应该根据党委的规划，在党的统一领导下，选择重点，创造典型经验，推动一般，在发动和组织妇女参加合作化运动和增产运动中工作得更好。
