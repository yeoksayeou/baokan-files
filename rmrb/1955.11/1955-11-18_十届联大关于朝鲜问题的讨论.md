The tenth UN General Assembly has begun its discussion on the Korean question. The discussions thus far show that the United States' attempts to exclude relevant parties and impose one party's will on the other are not conducive to a peaceful resolution of the Korean question, but only serve to isolate the United States further.

The fact is very clear that only through consultation with the participation of all relevant parties can a peaceful resolution of the Korean question be achieved. If the tenth UN General Assembly is to conduct a fair discussion on the Korean question, it must invite all relevant parties to participate. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a relevant party and should naturally participate in the UN General Assembly's discussion on the Korean question. The Chinese people fully support the statement made by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Nam Il, on October 31st to the President of the current UN General Assembly and the UN Secretary-General, requesting to participate in the current UN General Assembly's discussion on the Korean question. At the same time, this statement has gained broad international support. However, despite the fact that fourteen countries, including Afghanistan, Burma, Byelorussia, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Ukraine, the Soviet Union, Yemen, and Yugoslavia, advocated inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion of the Korean question, and ten countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Canada, Iran, Israel, Lebanon, Liberia, Mexico, Pakistan, and Sweden, did not support the United States' attempt to exclude the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States and its followers still persisted in their consistent policy of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, exerted pressure on other countries, monopolized the meeting, and passed a resolution excluding representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the discussion, inevitably leading the UN's discussion on the Korean question into a dead end.

In the Korean armistice negotiations and the Military Armistice Commission after the armistice, the relevant parties to the Korean question have always been on an equal footing. In fact, only when the relevant parties mutually recognize their due equal status can fruitful discussions be conducted. The conference on the Korean question held in Geneva in 1954, although interrupted due to the sabotage of the United States, involved all relevant parties acknowledging each other's equal status in the discussions. Now, the United States and its followers insist on refusing to recognize the status of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as a relevant party to the Korean question, attempting to impose one party's will on the other in a monopolistic manner. May we ask, if the United States and its followers could not impose their will on the other party on the battlefield, how can they imagine that they would really believe that they could do in the conference what they could not do on the battlefield? Obviously, the United States government's actions show that it has no intention of peacefully resolving the Korean question. What it wants to do is merely to continue its "cold war" policy in the United Nations, which has long been unanimously rejected by peace-loving people around the world, obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and prevent the easing of tensions in the Far East.

In order to obstruct discussions on the peaceful resolution of the Korean question in the UN General Assembly, the US representative does not hesitate to fabricate all kinds of absurd lies and engage in slander. He even openly accused the Korean and Chinese sides of detaining civilians and prisoners of war from the UN forces. This is a complete distortion of the truth. Everyone knows that the Korean and Chinese sides have acted entirely in accordance with the agreements between the two sides and the Armistice Agreement: civilians living in North Korea who were willing to go south after the armistice have returned to South Korea in accordance with the provisions of the Armistice Agreement, and prisoners of war from the UN forces have also been repatriated or transferred to the Neutral Nation Repatriation Commission in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. On the contrary, it is the US side that has violated the Armistice Agreement by detaining a large number of civilians and prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese sides. When the US military retreated from North Korea in 1950 and withdrew from the rear coastal islands after the armistice in 1953, they abducted a large number of civilians. Especially condemned by the world is the US side's forced detention of prisoners of war from the Korean and Chinese sides. In June 1953, the US-Rhee Syngman group violated the agreement on the issue of prisoners of war that had already been signed by both sides, falsely claiming that prisoners of war had escaped, and forcibly detained more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. At that time, General Clark, the Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations forces, had to express to the Korean and Chinese sides under the protest of the Korean and Chinese sides that he was "continuing efforts to recover the escaped prisoners of war." However, the US side has not yet accounted for these more than 27,000 prisoners of war. In January 1954, the US side violated the "Scope of Authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," illegally removed the prisoner of war status of more than 21,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, forcibly detained them, and sent them to Chiang Kai-shek and Rhee Syngman to be incorporated into the army and used as cannon fodder. The "Final Report" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission clearly pointed out: "Any change in the status of prisoners of war who have been returned or are about to be returned, whether by declaring them to be civilians or in any other way, before the implementation of the interpretation procedure and after discussions at the political conference, is a violation of the 'Scope of Authority' and the Armistice Agreement." Although the Indian representative withdrew its original proposal at this session of the UN General Assembly to discuss the "Final Report" of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission due to the obstruction of the United States, this issue has not been resolved, and the United States bears an inescapable responsibility for its major crime of forcibly detaining more than 21,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and must account for it.

The US representative also accused the Korean and Chinese sides of violating the Armistice Agreement by bringing in military reinforcements. This is clearly a fabricated excuse by the United States, the purpose of which is to cover up its own policy of encouraging an arms race in South Korea. The repeated reports and public documents of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which monitors the Korean armistice, prove that the Korean and Chinese sides have complied with the Armistice Agreement, and it is well known to the world that the Chinese People's Volunteers have withdrawn nineteen divisions from Korea since the Korean armistice. In fact, it is the US side that has consistently violated the Armistice Agreement, illegally bringing in military reinforcements, weapons and ammunition, in order to arm the greatly expanded Rhee Syngman army. Precisely because the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, which monitors the armistice, hinders the United States' blatant violations of the Armistice Agreement, the Rhee Syngman group, with the support of the US side, has continuously obstructed, threatened, slandered, and undermined the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, and even resorted to various means to abolish the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Sincerity is to be tested by action. If the United States intends to peacefully resolve the Korean question, it has no reason to oppose the proposal to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea; however, despite the repeated proposals of the Korean and Chinese sides, the United States has so far opposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea. The fact that the United States is expanding its armaments in South Korea cannot be concealed. After the armistice, it signed a treaty with the Rhee Syngman group, attempting to permanently station troops in Korea. The United States has greatly expanded the Rhee Syngman army, and has armed more than ten divisions of the Rhee Syngman army since the armistice. Recently, the United States has also been training the Rhee Syngman army to use atomic weapons. The US military buildup in South Korea and the US obstruction of the peaceful reunification of Korea are two sides of the same policy.

However, despite the constant obstruction by the United States, the call for a peaceful resolution of the Korean question through consultation among the relevant parties has become increasingly louder. In the Political Committee of this session of the UN General Assembly, Indian representative Menon criticized the United States' attitude of excluding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from participating in the discussion of the Korean question, pointing out that it was "extremely undesirable." Canadian representative Martin pointed out that "the essence of the problem is that Korean unification can only be achieved through some kind of negotiation by those who can achieve it," and warned against "leading the Korean question into a dead end." The fact that many countries in the United Nations, including most Asian and African countries, advocate inviting representatives of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to participate in the discussion particularly clearly demonstrates the widespread dissatisfaction of many countries with the United States' policy of obstructing the peaceful resolution of the Korean question. These situations show that the world situation has changed, and the United States' policies are becoming increasingly unpopular.

The Chinese people have always been concerned about the Korean question, resolutely oppose all acts that obstruct the peaceful resolution of the Korean question, and actively advocate that all means should be sought to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The Chinese people advocate that the relevant countries should hold a Far East conference with the broad participation of Asian countries to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. We fully support the speech made by Soviet representative Malik on November 14 in the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly. In his speech, he correctly pointed out that, given that the countries most relevant to the Korean question are deprived of the opportunity to state their views on the Korean question, the necessity of convening a meeting of the relevant countries to discuss the Korean question becomes even more obvious. This is entirely consistent with the spirit of the majority of Asian and African countries in the United Nations, which advocate that the relevant countries should jointly consult on a peaceful resolution of the Korean question. The tenth UN General Assembly's discussion on the Korean question has once again proved that any attempt to impose one party's will on the other is unlikely to yield any positive results. The Korean question cannot remain unresolved for a long time; we believe that the time for seriously considering convening a meeting of the relevant countries to seek a peaceful resolution of the Korean question should no longer be delayed.

### 十届联大关于朝鲜问题的讨论

　　十届联大关于朝鲜问题的讨论
    十届联大已经开始了关于朝鲜问题的讨论。截至现在为止的讨论经过表明美国企图排斥有关一方，而将一方意志强加于另一方的做法不仅无助于朝鲜问题的和平解决，而只能使美国陷于愈来愈孤立的地位。
      事实很清楚，只有在有关各方的参加之下，通过协商，才能求得朝鲜问题的和平解决；第十届联合国大会如果要对朝鲜问题进行公正的讨论，就必须邀请有关各方参加。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国是有关的一方，当然应该参加联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论。中国人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务相南日十月三十一日向本届联合国大会主席和联合国秘书长提出的要求参加本届联合国大会关于朝鲜问题的讨论的声明。同时，这个声明也获得了广泛的国际支持。但是尽管有阿富汗、缅甸、白俄罗斯、捷克斯洛伐克、埃及、印度、印度尼西亚、波兰、沙特阿拉伯、叙利亚、乌克兰、苏联、也门和南斯拉夫等十四个国家主张邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表参加关于朝鲜问题的讨论，同时阿根廷、玻利维亚、加拿大、伊朗、以色列、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、墨西哥、巴基斯坦和瑞典等十个国家并不支持美国排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的主张，美国和它的追随者仍然坚持它们一贯的阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的政策，对其他国家施行压力，垄断会场，通过了排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论的决议，使联合国关于朝鲜问题的讨论不可避免地走进了死胡同。
    在朝鲜停战谈判和停战后的军事停战委员会中，朝鲜问题的有关方面一向是处于对等的地位。事实上，只有有关各方互相承认应有的对等地位，才能进行有益的讨论。一九五四年在日内瓦举行的讨论朝鲜问题的会议虽然由于美国的破坏而中断，但是有关各方都是承认了互相对等的地位来进行讨论的。现在，美国和它的追随者却坚持拒绝承认朝鲜民主主义人民共和国作为朝鲜问题有关一方的地位，企图用包办垄断的方式将一方意志强加于另一方。请问，美国和它的追随者如果不能在战场上将自己的意志强加于另一方，如何能设想它们自己会真的相信能在会场上做出它们在战场上所不能做到的事呢？很显然，美国政府这样做就表明它根本不想和平解决朝鲜问题，它想做的仅仅是，在联合国中继续它早已遭到全世界爱好和平的人民所一致唾弃的“冷战”政策，阻挠朝鲜问题的和平解决，阻止远东紧张局势的缓和。
    为了在联合国大会阻挠关于和平解决朝鲜问题的讨论，美国代表不惜凭空捏造种种荒谬的谎言，进行诬蔑。他竟公然诬蔑朝中方面扣留了联合国军方面的平民和战俘。这真是不折不扣的颠倒是非。谁都知道朝中方面是完全按照双方协议和停战协定办事的：住在北朝鲜的平民在停战后愿意南去的都已按照停战协定的规定回到了南朝鲜，联合国军方面的被俘人员也都已按照停战协定遣返或移交中立国遣返委员会。相反地，正是美方违反停战协定，大量扣留朝中方面的平民和战俘。美军在一九五○年从北朝鲜败退时和一九五三年停战后从后方沿海岛屿撤走时曾经掳走了大批平民。尤其遭到举世谴责的是美方强迫扣留朝中方面的被俘人员。一九五三年六月，美方李承晚集团违反双方已经签字的关于战俘问题的协议，诡称战俘逃亡，强迫扣留了朝中战俘二万七千多人。当时联合国军总司令克拉克将军在朝中方面抗议之下也不得不向朝中方面表示“正继续努力以追回已逃亡的战俘”。但是，对于这二万七千余名战俘，美方至今未作交代。一九五四年一月美方违反“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，非法解除二万一千多名朝中战俘的战俘身分，将他们强迫扣留，分别押送给蒋介石、李承晚编入军队，充当炮灰。中立国遣返委员会的“最后报告”曾经明确指出：“在实施解释程序和经过政治会议讨论之前，用宣布成为平民身分或用任何其他方式，来对已经交还的或准备交还的战俘的身分作任何改变，都是违反‘职权范围’和停战协定的”。虽然由于美国的阻挠，印度代表在本届联合国大会中撤回了它原来提出的就中立国遣返委员会的“最后报告”进行讨论的提案，但是，这个问题并未解决，美国对于它强迫扣留二万一千多名朝中战俘这一重大的罪行负有不可逃避的责任，是必须作出交代的。
    美国代表还诬蔑朝中方面违反停战协定运进军事增援。这显然是美国凭空捏造出来的一个借口，其目的正是为了掩护它自己在南朝鲜鼓励进行扩军备战的政策。监督朝鲜停战的中立国监察委员会的迭次报告和公开文件证明了朝中方面遵守停战协定，而中国人民志愿军在朝鲜停战后已经自朝鲜撤出了十九个师是举世皆知的。事实上，正是美方一贯违反停战协定，非法运进军事增援性的武器、军火，以武装大量扩充的李承晚军队。正因为监督停战的中立国监察委员会妨碍着美国公然违反停战协定的行为，李承晚集团就在美方的支持下不断对中立国监察委员会进行阻挠、威胁、诽谤、破坏，乃至不惜采取各种手段来取消中立国监察委员会。诚意是要由行动来考验的，如果美国有意于和平解决朝鲜问题，它就没有理由反对从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队的主张；但是尽管朝中方面一再提出这一主张，美国却至今反对从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队。美国在南朝鲜扩军备战的事实是掩盖不了的，它在停战之后就同李承晚集团签订条约，企图在朝鲜永久驻军。美国大量扩充李承晚军队，停战后已经武装了李承晚军队十个师以上。最近美国又在训练李承晚军队使用原子武器。美国在南朝鲜的扩军备战和美国阻挠朝鲜的和平统一正是同一个政策的两面。
    但是，尽管美国不断进行阻挠，经过有关各方的协商来和平解决朝鲜问题的呼声已经愈来愈高。在本届联合国大会政治委员会上，印度代表梅农就曾批评美国排斥朝鲜民主主义人民共和国参加朝鲜问题讨论的态度，指出那是“极其不值得称赞的”。加拿大代表马丁指出，“问题的实质是只有由那些能够实现朝鲜统一的方面进行某种谈判，才能实现朝鲜统一”，并且警告不应将朝鲜问题“引到死胡同去”。联合国中很多国家包括大多数亚非国家都主张邀请朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的代表参加讨论尤其明显地表现了许多国家对于美国阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的政策的广泛的不满。这些情况显示着世界形势变了，美国的政策已经愈来愈不得人心。
    中国人民一向关心朝鲜问题，坚决反对一切阻挠和平解决朝鲜问题的行为，积极主张应该寻求一切办法来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。中国人民主张有关国家应该举行一次有亚洲国家广泛参加的远东会议来谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决。我们完全支持苏联代表马立克十一月十四日在联合国大会政治委员会上的发言，他在发言中正确地指出，鉴于同朝鲜问题最有关的国家被剥夺机会陈述自己对朝鲜问题的意见，召开有关国家讨论朝鲜问题的会议的必要性就更加明显。这同联合国中大多数亚非国家所主张的由有关国家共同协商和平解决朝鲜问题的精神是完全一致的。十届联大关于朝鲜问题的讨论又一次证明，任何企图将一方的意志强加于另一方的做法，是不可能得到任何积极结果的。朝鲜问题不能长期悬而不决；我们认为，认真考虑召开有关国家的会议来谋求和平解决朝鲜问题的时机是不应该再推迟了。
