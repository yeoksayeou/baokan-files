Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th - Japan Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, on his way from Mito to Sendai on November 13, gave a statement to reporters on the merger of the two conservative parties, the Japan Democratic Party and the Liberal Party.

Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out: The merger of the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party is a conservative party power grab by the Hatoyama Cabinet, which is encountering difficulties, in order to maintain its regime. This is an attempt to artificially change the results of elections by causing members to separate and regroup, in an attempt to maintain power forever, so the Socialist Party expresses its firm opposition.

Suzuki Mosaburo said: The Japan Socialist Party has already decided at its unified congress to investigate the reactionary and deceptive nature of the Hatoyama Cabinet's rearmament and constitutional revision, as well as its disregard for its promises. Suzuki Mosaburo pointed out: The third Hatoyama Cabinet, which will be formed after the merger of the conservative parties, also violates the principle of transferring power through general elections.

Suzuki Mosaburo said: The Japan Socialist Party advocates that power should be transferred through general elections, according to the will of the people, who are the masters of the constitution, and demands that the government dissolve the Diet and hold general elections. Suzuki stated: Therefore, the Japan Socialist Party will submit a proposal to demand the dissolution of the Diet at the upcoming extraordinary session of the Diet, and will submit a motion of no confidence in the cabinet at the regular session of the Diet.

Suzuki Mosaburo also said: Regarding the issue of Sunagawa-machi and military bases across the country, we firmly support the struggle of local residents (against the expansion of US military bases), and firmly oppose the government's suppression policies such as compulsory measurement and compulsory execution. In the Diet, we will investigate the government's reactionary policies and its diplomacy of following the United States.

Suzuki Mosaburo also said: The issue of military bases arises from the Japan-US "Security Treaty," "Administrative Agreement," and the laws and regulations based on these two treaties. Therefore, it is necessary to make the Japanese people thoroughly understand that this problem cannot be solved unless these unequal treaties are fundamentally reformed and abolished, and Japan's complete independence is realized. We are determined to fight to the end to make this a problem of striving for complete independence. Suzuki emphasized that, to achieve this goal, we will demand that the government make efforts to abolish unequal treaties and appeal to the whole world to realize Japan's complete independence.

　　日本社会党主席铃木评保守党的合并
    新华社十五日讯　东京消息：日本社会党主席铃木茂三郎十一月十三日从水户到仙台的途中在火车上就日本民主党和自由党两个保守党的合并问题，向记者发表了谈话。
    铃木茂三郎指出：民主党和自由党的合并，是遭遇到难关的鸠山内阁为了维持政权而进行的保守政党授受政权。这是要用人为地使议员离合聚散的方式来改变选举的结果，想要永远掌握政权，所以社会党表示坚决反对。
    铃木茂三郎说：日本社会党已经在统一大会上决定要追究鸠山内阁重整军备和修改宪法的反动性质、欺骗性质和它的不顾诺言的行为。铃木茂三郎指出：保守政党合并后将产生的第三次鸠山内阁，还破坏了通过大选转移政权的原则。
    铃木茂三郎说：日本社会党主张应该通过大选，按照宪法的主人翁国民的意志来转移政权，并且要求政府解散国会，举行大选。铃木表示：因此，日本社会党要在即将召开的国会临时会议中，提出要求解散国会的提案，并且在国会平时会议中，要提出不信任内阁的提案。
    铃木茂三郎还说：关于砂川町和全国各地军事基地问题，我们坚决支持当地居民（反对扩大美军基地）的斗争，并且坚决反对政府的强制测量、强制执行等镇压政策。在国会里，要追究政府的反动政策和追随美国的外交。
    铃木茂三郎并且说：军事基地的问题，是由日美“安全条约”、“行政协定”以及基于这两个条约而制定的法令产生的，所以要使日本国民彻底了解，如果不根本改革和取消这些不平等条约，实现日本的完全独立，就不能解决这个问题。我们决心把这作为争取完全独立的问题而斗争到底。铃木强调说，为达到这个目的，我们将要求政府努力取消不平等条约，并且向全世界呼吁，实现日本的完全独立。
