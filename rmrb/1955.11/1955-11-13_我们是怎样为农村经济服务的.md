How We Serve the Rural Economy
Wen Guangzhong, Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Industry

It was only in the second half of last year that we arrived at a correct answer as to what direction local industry should develop.

From 1949 to 1950, we blindly followed the market; whatever sold quickly in the market, we would build factories to produce.

From 1951 to 1952, the central government proposed that local industry should face the countryside. However, we did not understand the needs of the countryside, nor did we conduct investigations and research. We blindly built factories based on subjective assumptions. We built a walking plow factory, produced for more than half a year, but the products piled up like mountains and could not be sold, so we had to close the factory. We also built a sprayer factory, and the products produced in more than half a year would not be used up in the province for five years, so it was also forced to close.

A new way out had to be found. Therefore, our eyes turned to other places and the central government: we planned to find sales channels in cities and nationwide, and when we encountered difficulties, we would ask the higher authorities to solve them. As a result, this brought many difficulties to production: First, the supply of raw materials, the promotion of finished products, and the allocation of production tasks all had to rely on the central government. We could not handle the complex tasks given by the central government, and the simple tasks were not enough, so many factories were often in a state of "starvation." Second, because equipment, technology, transportation conditions, and other aspects were not as good as those of central state-owned factories, the quality of the same products was lower, the cost was higher, and coupled with long-distance transportation, the sales of products were very poor.

After encountering this series of difficulties, we began to feel that relying on the central government to solve the problems of raw materials and tasks was not the direction for the development of local industry, and we needed to find a way out locally. At this time, the central government proposed that local industry must "implement the policy of serving the rural economy and closely combining with the rural economy." This instruction connected with our experience in practical work, which enabled us to have a relatively complete understanding of the development direction of local industry.

The leaders recognized this policy, but it was not easy to implement it among all the staff and in actual work. At the mention of "serving the rural economy," everyone associated it with the past events of opening and closing factories, and felt that it was impossible to go down the old road again. Some people thought that in large-scale economic construction, the needs of industrial construction far exceeded the needs of the countryside, and the purchasing power of farmers was low. Therefore, the main market for local industry at present was in cities rather than in the countryside. Many comrades still have capitalist management ideas, and are willing to make fixed products, unwilling to do odd jobs; willing to manufacture, unwilling to repair; willing to make large batches, unwilling to make small batches; willing to make products with large output value and high profits, unwilling to make products with small output value and low profits; willing to make products with fast turnover, unwilling to make products with slow turnover (the sales of agricultural tools are seasonal, and a year's work has to be compressed into half a year); willing to do ready-made things, unwilling to create and research by themselves; willing to have the higher authorities or commercial departments to sell the products, unwilling to deal directly with farmers. These thoughts are quite deeply rooted.

We repeatedly criticized these wrong ideas. In addition, many factories at that time had no work to do because they were facing the cities. Everyone felt that doing something was better than doing nothing, and they were also forced to "face the countryside." In particular, the provincial party committee and various prefectural and municipal party committees strictly urged all enterprises to earnestly implement this policy. Under the promotion of various parties, the eyes of various enterprises began to turn to the countryside. Once they came into contact with the reality of the countryside and received practical education, they realized the significance of the central policy, and capitalist ideas gradually turned around.

After everyone initially established the determination to serve agriculture, a new problem arose: What exactly do farmers need, and how much do they need? In order to solve this problem, the provincial-level organs formed seven working groups and visited 700 agricultural production cooperatives and other units, as well as more than 400 individual farmers. A total of 36 machinery factories and iron factories under the jurisdiction of various special districts and cities, 27 factories organized rural visiting groups and went to mountainous areas, plains areas, dry areas, water areas, sandy soil areas, and clay soil areas to conduct investigations and visits in counties, districts, townships, and villages. Only Cangxian, Tianjin, Tangshan, Xingtai, and Baoding special districts visited 53 counties, 577 supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural production cooperatives, and agricultural production mutual aid groups.

The visiting group initially went down to simply investigate what the farmers needed. But as soon as we investigated, the masses turned around and asked us: What do you have? Is it good or not? How effective is it? Bring it to us to see. Therefore, our visit went a step further: carrying new products, we went to markets, temple fairs, material exchange meetings, or commune members' meetings to perform and publicize, and invited the chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives and labor models to visit the factories and exchange opinions. On this basis, we further visited: What else do you need? During the in-depth visits, we found that the walking plows and chaff cutters bought by the farmers were broken and they did not know how to repair them, so they put them aside and did not use them. Therefore, we further brought technicians, skilled workers, machine parts and tools, and combined repairs with technical instruction during the visits.

This visit was very fruitful. First of all, it strengthened the relationship between workers and peasants. Under the criticism and supervision of the masses, enterprises overcame capitalist management ideas, improved product quality, and opened up sales channels. During the visit, we repaired agricultural tools for the masses free of charge and imparted technology, which moved the farmers very much. Some commune members said: The workers and old brothers came to visit with new agricultural tools, and also repaired agricultural tools and taught us repair skills. This is really something that has not happened in a hundred years. The farmers in Baxian asked the visiting personnel: Is it true or false that you say you want to strengthen the worker-peasant alliance? The visiting personnel replied: Of course it is true. The farmers said: If it is true, why have we never seen a reply from you when we organized hunting in winter and asked you for iron sand, when our crops were infested with insects and we asked you to manufacture grinders to grind arsenic, when we urgently needed you to manufacture oil hammers for flood prevention, and when we formed production cooperatives and wanted to buy iron bells? The farmers criticized us for making washbasins with uneven bottoms, pots that were crooked and easy to leak, soft chaff cutter blades, and uneven slicers. These criticisms greatly educated the factory leaders. They realized that they had not paid enough attention to meeting the specific needs of the masses in the past, and they had a deeper and more specific understanding of the importance of serving the rural economy. The arrogance and complacency of the factory workers were also initially overcome. In the past, when everyone heard the masses reflect on the poor quality of the products, they always thought that the farmers were "nitpicking and looking for faults," or that "the farmers don't know what's good and are blindly picking faults." After the visit, in the face of specific facts, we could no longer honestly admit our mistakes and began to consider how to improve our product quality. The workers said: If we make low-quality products again, the loss to the worker-peasant alliance will be even greater. After improving the product quality and specifications according to the requirements of the farmers, the masses liked them very much and scrambled to buy them. In the past, the Baoding Worker-Peasant Foundry Factory ignored the farmers' desire for small pots and closed its doors to make large pots. As a result, how much it produced was stockpiled. After the visit, it revised its plan and the monthly sales volume exceeded expectations. During this visit, Cangxian Special District signed contracts with various agricultural production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives for 819 chaff cutters, 2,400 iron shovels, and 2,600 pots. Tianjin Special District signed a product supply contract worth 1,300 yuan with a commune in Daliu Town, Wen'an County. Xingtai Special District signed 16 contracts, including 600 chaff cutters, 11,000 iron pots, 105 iron basins, and 5,383 jin of cast iron parts, as well as many weeding hoes, plowshares, slicers, etc.

This visit also enabled us to initially understand the needs of the farmers. With the continuous development of the agricultural cooperation movement, the farmers put forward a series of new demands to us. These demands are increasing, and are by no means what we imagined that the countryside only needs simple plows, harrows, sickles, and hoes. Moreover, with the different degrees of cooperation, different farming tasks, and different regions, the requirements for varieties and specifications are also different. For example, the state advocates close planting, and the farmers require close planting drills and small ridge weeding hoes; the state calls for full seedlings, and the farmers propose to have seedling transplanters, seedling replanting machines, and seedling thinning machines; the state calls for planting more oil crops, and the farmers propose to have peanut diggers and seeding machines; the state requires planting more cotton, and the farmers propose to have cotton seeders and cotton picking machines. These requirements are not only diverse, but also in large quantities.

In terms of living materials, it is not just a matter of improving quality and reducing costs, but also to meet the different requirements of farmers in terms of variety and specifications. For example, the countryside needs flannel shirts with open fronts and buttons, but the factory only makes tube-shaped ones, which the masses are unwilling to buy. We produce more white and double-layered enamel products; while farmers prefer flowered and single-layered ones (because they are cheaper). This shows that we have not paid enough attention to adapting industrial production to the living standards and habits of farmers.

After understanding the needs of the masses, we immediately studied and trial-produced various new products. Facts have proved that with our current technical level, we can complete this task as long as we closely contact the farmers. Our specific methods are: First, establish a fertilizer research institute to concentrate technical personnel to specialize in the problem of using provincial resources to produce fertilizer; second, assign the research and study of mass inventions and creations, and designate specialized factories to be responsible for contacting and researching and trial-producing with the inventors (the enthusiasm of the farmers and workers in Hebei Province is very high, and in recent years, they have put forward hundreds of creative invention suggestions); third, organize visits, and after the successful trial production of new products, take them to agricultural production cooperatives for testing, and combine our technical research with the practical experience of farmers through these methods; fourth, strengthen contact with neighboring regions and academic institutions.

Using these methods, we have successfully trial-produced 15 kinds of new agricultural tools in the past year, and 22 kinds are being trial-produced and researched and designed. In terms of handicraft tools and household appliances, four kinds have been successfully trial-produced; nine kinds are being trial-produced and designed and researched. In terms of power machinery, three kinds have been successfully trial-produced. In terms of irrigation machines, five kinds have been successfully trial-produced. In terms of fertilizers, we are also conducting trial production and research and investigation.

At present, the local state-owned factories in Hebei Province, which are actively turning to serve the rural economy, have basically shaken off the state of "starvation." However, the newly successfully trial-produced products still need to strive to reduce costs and selling prices, and improve specifications and quality. At the same time, we must vigorously organize performances and promote them in the countryside; otherwise, even if they are successfully manufactured, the vast number of farmers will not know about it, and the factories will still not be able to produce in large quantities.

Our implementation of the policy of "serving the rural economy and closely combining with the rural economy" has only achieved initial results in the manufacture of agricultural machinery. However, the practice of the past year has given us great inspiration and made us clearly see that if we continue to follow this path, the development prospects of local industry are infinitely broad. Not only will sales increase year by year (for example, the Provincial People's Committee recently decided to promote 70,000 well-less water trucks in the next two years, requiring eight factories to carry out production with all their strength); the raw materials are also inexhaustible and inexhaustible locally. For example, for oil crops, if each person in the countryside retains three jin, then 36 million people in Hebei Province will have more than 100 million jin. However, the masses currently handle these oil crops very badly. Some are coarsely pressed, and the oil yield is very low; some are even directly used as fertilizer, which is a great waste. Grinding wheat into flour dispersedly not only has a low flour yield, but mainly has a great impact on agricultural production in terms of manpower and animal power. However, the farmers are unwilling to take these things out, because they not only want oil and flour, but also oil cakes and bran. If we run some small oil extraction factories and flour mills, processing them locally, and giving the oil cakes and bran to the farmers together, they will be very welcome, and the factory's raw material problem will also be solved, under the principle of not crowding out handicrafts and transforming and improving handicrafts. As for other resources and usable waste materials, there are even more everywhere in cities and the countryside. For example, the sesame straw and cotton stalks in the countryside, the waste materials and sewage of factories in the cities, etc., can all be used.

The preliminary results of more than a year of practice have proved that if local industrial departments earnestly implement the policy of serving the rural economy, they can play a great role in ensuring increased agricultural production and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture. The May 1st Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingtang County used a 7-horsepower pot camel machine to irrigate 900 mu of land this year, and the yield of wheat per mu can be increased by 76 jin. Zhao Minglai Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xisanjiao Village, Shijiazhuang City, uses a 7-horsepower pot camel machine to irrigate vegetable gardens. The daily cost is 35 yuan less than using ten waterwheels of the same effectiveness, and it can also increase the harvest by 10%. Xu Yishan, the head of Donggaozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Baoding City, introduced the situation of the Baoding City New Agricultural Tools Exhibition to the farmers at a meeting. Ten farmers asked to join the cooperative on the spot. Lan Shutong, a newly-joined farmer, said: "If you want to use machines and increase production, you can't do it without joining the cooperative." With the arrival of power machines in the countryside, the agricultural product processing industry using small machines has also developed. The May 1st Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingtang County uses a pot camel machine to drive a cotton gin, which can gin 8,000 to 9,000 jin of seed cotton per day, which is equivalent to the labor of 50 to 60 people. They signed a processing contract with the cooperative, and the processing fee they get every day is enough for the food expenses of the entire cooperative of 495 people.

Our experience is that when implementing the policy of serving the rural economy, we must pay attention to making unified arrangements for various economic types of industry, and we must make full use of the power of private industry and handicrafts. Local state-owned factories and mines are generally superior to private industry and handicrafts in terms of equipment and technology. Therefore, the focus of local state-owned machinery factories and iron factories should be on researching and producing new agricultural tools. As for the old-fashioned agricultural tools needed by individual farmers, they should be given to private industry and handicrafts to produce as much as possible, and they should be widely absorbed to participate in the agricultural tool repair and distribution network, or their production tasks should be solved by organizing collaboration and using the method of large factories leading small factories. The so-called overall planning and unified arrangement is by no means a passive distribution of food. Only by earnestly implementing the policy of serving the rural economy can we make overall plans and unified arrangements in an active way. Our experience in the past year has proved that each successful trial production of a new agricultural tool can solve the production problems of many factories. For example, the well-less water truck was successfully trial-produced this year, and next year it will be necessary to organize ten factories to produce with all their strength in order to meet the needs of the masses next year.

Once the new agricultural tools are promoted, the problem of repair and distribution arises. This task cannot be solved by relying on a few regular factories alone, because it is impossible for us to build a factory every few villages; and handicrafts are scattered and the production method is fluid, which is most suitable for undertaking this work. Now we have established a repair and distribution network including more than 600 points in accordance with the spirit of "giving full play to the overall role of various economic types in local industry," with larger factories run by local state-owned and cooperative societies as the core, responsible for supplying parts and imparting technology. Repair and distribution stations are set up in various towns, which are undertaken by handicraft cooperatives or private factories. Around the repair and distribution stations, there are also mobile repair teams composed of small craftsmen - blacksmith shops. In the past, the repair and distribution work was not organized, and farmers had to pay a very high price to get a screw. More often than not, there was no way to repair it at all. Now it is much more convenient to repair agricultural tools, and the repair and distribution price has been reduced by 17%. The repair and distribution network in Tianjin Special District repaired and distributed 82,151 various agricultural tools for farmers in one month. This repair and distribution network not only solves the problems of farmers, but also solves the production tasks of private iron industry and handicrafts; and, through this form, organizing them is also convenient for carrying out socialist transformation on them.

　　我们是怎样为农村经济服务的
　　河北省工业厅厅长　温光中
    地方工业究竟应该朝着什么样的方向发展，我们到去年下半年才得到了正确的解答。
    一九四九年到一九五○年间，我们只是盲目地跟随市场跑，市场上什么东西卖得快，就建立什么工厂。
      一九五一年到一九五二年，中央提出了地方工业要面向农村。但是我们不了解农村需要，又不调查研究，只凭主观想像盲目地建厂。我们建立过一座步犁工厂，生产了半年多，产品堆积如山，销不了，只好关门。又建立了一座喷雾器工厂，半年多时间中生产的产品，本省五年也用不完，也被迫关了门。
    必须寻找新的出路。于是，我们的眼睛就转向了外地和中央：打算在城市里和全国范围内找销路，碰到困难就请求上级来解决。这样做的结果，给生产带来了不少困难：第一、原料供应、成品推销以及生产任务的分配，事事都要依靠中央，中央给的复杂活干不了，简单活不够干，许多厂常常处于“挨饿”状态。第二、因为设备、技术、运输条件等各方面都没有中央国营工厂好，制造同样的产品，质量就低，成本就高，再加上长途运输，产品销路很不好。
    碰到了这一系列的困难后，我们开始感到：依靠中央来解决原料和任务问题，不是地方工业的发展方向，需要在本地找出路。这时，恰好中央提出了地方工业必须“贯彻为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合”的方针，这一指示和我们在实际工作中碰出来的体会接了头，使我们对地方工业的发展方针开始有了比较完整的认识。
    领导人员认识了这个方针，但是，要在全体工作人员中，在实际工作中贯彻执行这一方针，却不是容易的事。一提起“为农村经济服务”，大家就联想起过去开厂关厂的事，觉得重走老路，走不通。有的人以为在大规模的经济建设中，工业建设上的需要远远超过农村中的需要，农民的购买力低，因此目前地方工业的主要市场在城市而不在农村。还有不少同志有资本主义经营思想，愿意做固定的产品，不愿意打杂；愿意制造，不愿意修理；愿意作大批的，不愿意作零星的；愿意作产值大利润高的产品，不愿意作产值小利润低的产品；愿意作周转快的产品，不愿意作周转慢的产品（农具的销售有季节性，一年的活要压半年）；愿意做现成的，不愿意自己去创造研究；愿意上级或商业部门包销，不愿意直接同农民打交道。这些思想都相当地根深蒂固。
    对于这些错误的思想，我们反复地进行了批判。再加上当时许多工厂由于面向城市，没有活干，大家觉得干点总比不干强，也被迫“面向农村”，特别是省委和各个地委、市委都严格督促各企业认真执行这个方针。这样在各方面的推动下，各个企业的眼睛就开始转向了农村。而一接触了农村实际，受到了实际的教育，便体会了中央方针的意义，资本主义思想便逐渐地扭转过来。
    在大家初步奠定了为农业服务的决心以后，又产生了一个新的问题：农民到底需要些什么，需要多少呢？为了解决这个问题，省一级机关组成了七个工作组，访问了七百个农业生产合作社和其他单位以及四百多个个体农民。各专区和各市所属的机器厂和铁工厂一共三十六个，就有二十七个厂组织了农村访问小组，分赴山区、平原区、旱地区、水地区、砂土区、黏土区的县、区、乡、村进行调查访问。仅沧县、天津、唐山、邢台、保定五个专区，就访问了五十三个县，五百七十七个供销合作社、农业生产合作社和农业生产互助组。
    访问组最初下去是单纯地调查农民需要什么。但是一调查，群众就反过来问我们：你们有些什么？好使不好使？效能有多大？拿来给我们看看。于是我们的访问又深入了一步：携带着新产品，去集市、庙会、物资交流会或社员大会上进行表演、宣传，邀请农业生产合作社的社长和劳动模范到工厂参观，交换意见。在这样的基础上，再进一步访问：你还需要什么？在深入的访问中，发现农民买去的步犁、铡草机坏了不会修理，便放起来不用了。于是我们又进一步带了技术人员、技术工人、机器零件和工具，在访问的时候结合修理和进行技术传授。
    这次访问收获很大。首先是密切了工农关系，企业在群众的批评和监督下克服了资本主义经营思想，提高了产品质量，打开了销路。我们在访问中给群众无偿地修理农具并传授技术，农民非常感动。有的社员说：工人老大哥带着新农具来访问，还给我们修理农具和教给修理手艺，这真是百年没有的事。霸县的农民问访问人员：你们说加强工农联盟，是真的还是假的？访问人员回答：当然是真的。农民说：既然是真的，为什么我们在冬季组织打猎向你们要铁砂子的时候，当我们的庄稼生虫要求你们制造碾子碾信石的时候，当我们防汛紧急要求你们制造油锤的时候，当生产合作社成立向你们购买铁钟的时候，始终见不到你们一封回信呢？农民们批评我们做的洗脸盆底不平，锅是歪的，又容易漏，铡草机的刀片软，切片机切得不匀。这些批评大大地教育了工厂的领导人员。他们认识到了自己过去对满足群众的具体需要注意不够，并且更深刻、更具体地认识到为农村经济服务的重要。各厂职工的骄傲自满情绪也初步得到克服。过去大家听到群众反映产品质量不好，总认为农民“吹毛求疵，爱找毛病”，或者认为“农民不懂眼，瞎挑毛病”。访问以后，在具体事实面前，再不能不老老实实承认错误，开始考虑如何改进自己的产品质量了。工人们说：如果咱们再造质量低的产品，工农联盟的损失就更大了。而按照农民要求改善产品质量规格之后，群众都非常喜爱，争着购买。保定工农铸造厂过去不理睬农民愿意要小锅的要求，关门造大锅，结果生产多少就积压多少；访问以后，修改了计划，每月的销售量都超过了预计。在这次访问中，沧县专区同各农业生产合作社、供销合作社签订了铡草机八百一十九台，铁锨二千四百把，锅二千六百口的合同。天津专区同文安县大流镇一个社就签订了价值一千三百元的产品供应合同。邢台专区签订了十六份合同，包括铡草机六百台、铁锅一万一千口、铁盆一百零五个，铸铁零件五千三百八十三斤，还有很多的耘锄、犁铧、切片机等。
    这次访问还使我们初步摸清了农民的需要。随着农业合作化运动的不断发展，农民向我们提出了一系列的新的要求。这种要求越来越多，绝不是我们所想像的农村里只需要简单的犁、耙、镰刀、锄头。而且，随着合作化程度的不同，耕作任务的不同和地区的不同，在品种、规格上的要求也不同。例如，国家提倡密植，农民就要求密植耧、小垅耘锄；国家号召满苗，农民就提出要移苗器、补苗器、定苗器；国家号召种植油料，农民就提出要刨花生机、点种机；国家要求多植棉，农民就提出要棉花播种机、摘棉花机。这些要求不仅多种多样，而且数量也很大。
    在生活资料方面，也不仅仅是一般的提高质量、降低成本的问题，而是要在品种、规格上满足农民不同的要求。如农村需要开襟带扣的绒衣，可是工厂只做钻筒的，群众不愿意买。搪瓷制品我们多生产白色的、双料的；而农民多喜欢花的、单料的（因为便宜）。这都说明我们还没有十分注意使工业生产和农民的生活水平、生活习惯相适应。
    了解了群众需要以后，我们紧接着就研究试制各种新产品。事实证明，以我们现有的技术水平，只要密切联系农民，是可以完成这项任务的。我们采取的具体办法是：一、成立肥料研究所，集中技术人员专门研究利用本省资源生产肥料的问题；二、分工研究群众的发明创造，指定专门的工厂负责同发明者联系和研究、试制（河北省农民和工人群众的创造热情是很高的，几年来提出的创造发明建议多达数百件）；三、组织访问，新产品试制成功后拿到农业生产合作社去试验，通过这些办法使我们的技术研究同农民的实际经验结合起来；四、加强同邻近地区和学术机关的联系。
    运用这些办法，一年来我们已经试制成功了十五种新式农具，正在试制和研究设计的有二十二种。在手工业工具和生活用具方面，已经试制成功的有四种；正在试制和设计研究的有九种。在动力机械方面，已试制成功三种。在灌溉机器方面，试制成功了五种。在肥料方面，也正在试制和研究调查。
    目前河北省的地方国营工厂，凡是积极转向为农村经济服务的，已经基本上摆脱了“挨饿”状态。但是，已试制成功的新产品还需要努力降低成本和售价，改进规格和质量。同时还要大力组织表演，在农村中宣传推广；否则虽然制造成功了，广大农民不知道，工厂仍然不能大批生产。
    我们执行“为农村经济服务并同农村经济密切结合”的方针，还只是在制造农业机械方面取得了初步成绩。但是，这一年多的实践给了我们很大的启发，使我们清楚地看到：如果继续照着这条道路走去，地方工业的发展前途是无限广阔的。不仅销路将一年年增加（如省人民委员会最近决定要在今后二年中推广七万部无井水车，需要八个工厂全力进行生产）；就是原料，在当地也是取之不尽、用之不竭的。例如油料，农村中每人保留三斤，河北省三千六百万人，就有一亿多斤。但是群众目前把这些油料处理得很坏。有的是粗榨，出油率很低；有的甚至直接作了肥料，浪费很大。麦子分散磨面，不仅出粉率低，主要是在人力、畜力方面对农业生产的影响很大。但是农民不愿意把这些东西拿出来，因为他们不只是要油和面，而且要油饼和麸皮。如果我们在不排挤手工业和改造、提高手工业的原则下，举办一些小的榨油厂、面粉厂，就地加工，把油饼和麸子一并交给本人，农民一定很欢迎，工厂的原料问题也解决了。至于其他的资源和可资利用的废物废料，城市中和农村中更是俯拾即是。例如农村中的胡麻秸、棉花秸，城市中工厂的废料及污水等，都可以利用。
    一年多实践的初步成果证明：如果地方工业部门认真执行为农村经济服务的方针，就能够对保证农业增产和推动农业的社会主义改造起很大的作用。行唐县五一农业生产合作社今年用一台七马力锅驼机灌溉九百亩地，每亩小麦可增产七十六斤。石家庄市西三教村赵明来农业生产合作社用一台七马力锅驼机浇菜园，每天的费用比用同样效力的十台水车节省三十五元，还能增加收成百分之十。保定市郊区东高庄农业生产合作社社长许义山在一次会议上向农民介绍了保定市新农具展览会的情况，当场就有十户农民要求入社。新入社的农民蓝树桐说：“要想使用机器，增加产量，不入社就是不行。”随着动力机器的下乡，农村使用小型机器的农产品加工工业也有了发展。行唐县五一农业生产合作社用锅驼机带动轧花机，每天可轧籽棉八千至九千斤，顶五十至六十人的劳动。他们同合作社订了加工合同，每天得的加工费够全社四百九十五人的食粮费用。
    我们的经验是：在执行为农村经济服务的方针的时候，必须注意对各种经济类型的工业作统一安排，要充分利用私营工业和手工业的力量。地方国营厂矿在设备上、技术上一般优于私营工业和手工业，因此地方国营机器厂和铁工厂的重点应该是研究和生产新式农具。至于个体农民所需要的旧式农具，应尽量让给私营工业和手工业去生产，并广泛地吸收他们参加农具修配网，或经过组织协作，用大厂带小厂的办法来解决它们的生产任务问题。所谓统筹兼顾、统一安排，决不是消极地分饭吃，只有认真地执行为农村经济服务的方针，才是统筹兼顾、统一安排的积极作法。我们一年来的经验证明，每试制成功一种新式农具，就能解决好多厂的生产问题。如今年试制成功了无井水车，明年就需要组织十来个厂全力生产，才能满足群众明年的需要。
    新农具一推广，就发生了修配的问题。这个任务只依靠少数正规的工厂不能解决，因为我们不可能每隔几个村就盖一个工厂；而手工业是分散的，生产方式是流动的，最适合担任这件工作。现在我们已按照“发挥地方工业中各种经济类型的整体作用”的精神，建立了包括六百多个点的修配网，以地方国营、合作社营的较大工厂为核心，负责供应零件，传授技术。各个城镇设修配站，由手工业联社或私营工厂担任。围绕着修配站，还有由小手工业者——铁匠炉担任的流动修理小组。过去没有把修配工作组织起来，农民要配一个螺丝都要出很高的价钱。更多的是根本没法修。现在修理农具方便得多了，修配价格已降低了百分之十七。天津专区的修配网，在一个月内就为农民修配了各种农具八万二千一百五十一件。这种修配网不仅解决了农民的问题，也解决了私营铁工业和手工业的生产任务问题；而且，通过这种形式把它们组织起来，也便于对它们进行社会主义改造。
