Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 13th - According to a report by the Czechoslovak News Agency on the 12th: The Government of the Czechoslovak Republic, based on negotiations with the Government of the German Democratic Republic, has decided to release German citizens serving sentences in the Czechoslovak Republic early, due to crimes committed during the Second World War. 1,437 people have already been released. They have settled in the German Democratic Republic, the Federal Republic of Germany, and Austria. The Czechoslovak government made this decision based on the fact that these criminals have served most of their sentences, and more than ten years have passed since the end of the Second World War.

Those German citizens whose crimes were particularly serious and whose permanent residence is in the German Democratic Republic will be handed over to the state organs of the German Democratic Republic as war criminals.

    新华社布拉格十三日电　据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社十二日报道：捷克斯洛伐克共和国政府根据同德意志民主共和国政府的谈判，已经决定提前释放因在第二次世界大战期间犯有罪行而在捷克斯洛伐克共和国服刑的德国公民。已经有一千四百三十七人获得释放。他们已经在德意志民主共和国、德意志联邦共和国和奥地利定居下来。捷克斯洛伐克政府采取这一决定的根据是，这些罪犯已经服了大部分刑期，而且第二次世界大战结束已经有十年以上了。
    那些罪行特别严重、其永久住所在德意志民主共和国的德国公民，将作为战犯移交给德意志民主共和国国家机关。
