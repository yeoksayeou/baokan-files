    Guaranteeing the Quality of Newly Established Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives
    Zhao Zonghui
    Recently, Lushan County in Henan Province has developed 882 agricultural producers' cooperatives. Including the original 1,137 cooperatives, the county now has a total of 2,019 cooperatives, with farmer households joining the cooperatives accounting for over 80% of the county's total. These many newly established cooperatives basically meet the requirements of the Party Central Committee of "both quantity and quality" in developing agricultural cooperatives. The Lushan County Committee has adopted various effective measures to ensure the quality of the new cooperatives.
    Before carrying out the development of cooperatives, all Party members and non-Party cadres in the county seriously studied the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong on the need to pay attention to quality in the development of agricultural cooperatives. At the conference of cooperative building cadres and the expanded conference of county, district, and township three-level cadres held in the second half of September, the County Committee particularly emphasized the importance of ensuring the quality of new cooperatives, reminding everyone to prevent simply pursuing numbers. When carrying out the overall cooperative planning for the whole township, the township branches summarized the past experiences and lessons of neglecting quality when building cooperatives. Through repeated study, both within and outside the Party, there was a certain understanding of the issue of ensuring quality, which created favorable conditions for the cooperative building work. But this is by no means to say that all problems have been solved. When the work showed some achievements, some people were overwhelmed by the immediate victory, thinking that "the high tide has come," and that all problems could be solved by holding a meeting. Thus, they no longer did meticulous ideological work, forgetting the principle of emphasizing both quantity and quality. In the face of this situation, the County Committee promptly reminded them, clarifying the minds of these cadres through meetings and centralized training, overcoming their complacency and blindness.
    To ensure the quality of cooperatives, the preparatory work before building the cooperatives is of decisive significance. The Lushan County Committee did the following preparatory work before building the cooperatives: First, reviewing whether the framework of the cooperative has the conditions for conversion, whether the masses have undergone ideological mobilization, and whether the backbone and members are politically reliable. After the inspection, the cooperative frameworks were divided into several types, and specific work was carried out separately. Second, conscientiously training the backbone of cooperative building. The County Committee ran training courses, training 2,518 backbone members, and paid attention to improving their working abilities in actual work. The District Committee of the Eighth District organized the backbone members of the new cooperatives to participate in various meetings held by the old cooperatives to learn working methods from the old cooperative cadres; the Seventh District implemented a guidance method of one old cooperative cadre leading one new cooperative backbone member, and organized the backbone members to learn from the advanced experiences of running cooperatives; some townships convened meetings of backbone members, adopting the method of teaching, learning, and building cooperatives at the same time. In this way, a large number of cooperative building backbone members were trained in a short period of time. Third, carrying out in-depth ideological mobilization among the masses. The key to doing this work well is to make cadres realize the importance of ideological mobilization. The County Committee repeatedly pointed out to all Party members and non-Party cadres: Don't be satisfied when you see the enthusiasm of the masses for cooperation. The enthusiasm of the masses to join the cooperatives does not mean that they fully understand the Party's principles, policies, and specific methods of cooperation. If they are not given sufficient ideological mobilization work, this enthusiasm is not consolidated. After the cadres realized the significance of ideological mobilization work, they widely carried out propaganda work, which greatly reduced the ideological concerns of the farmers, and in many places, farmers signed up to join the cooperatives in batches.
    Correctly implementing the class policy of the rural cooperative movement is an indispensable condition for ensuring the quality of new cooperatives. In the 882 newly built cooperatives in Lushan County, poor and lower-middle peasants accounted for an absolute majority in 730 cooperatives; the strength of poor peasants, lower-middle peasants, and upper-middle peasants was equal in 125 cooperatives; and upper-middle peasants had the advantage in only 27 cooperatives. Among the 2,646 directors and deputy directors of the newly built cooperatives in the county, 1,970 were poor peasants and 595 were lower-middle peasants among the new and old middle peasants. When implementing the class policy, the County Committee grasped three key points: First, adopting the method of summarizing work to establish the class viewpoint of the cadres. The Party branch of Erlangmiao Township in the Fifth District summarized the achievements of the poor peasants in the mutual aid and cooperation movement over the years, and found that the cooperatives where the leadership was in the hands of the poor peasants were well-run. For example, the Xianfeng Cooperative, where the vast majority of members were poor peasants and had a higher socialist consciousness, has expanded year after year for three years. Not only is the cooperative well-run, but it can also play a model role in all aspects. The facts educated the cadres that they must rely on the poor peasants in the cooperative movement. Second, the political situation of the backbone members and members was examined to prevent counter-revolutionaries and bad elements from mixing into the cooperatives. The emergence of cooperative backbone members was first nominated by the Party branch, then discussed and elected by the masses, and finally approved by the District Committee. The political and historical situation of all members who joined the cooperative must also be appropriately understood, and those who are politically unreliable or of bad character must be cleaned out or subjected to mass supervision. Third, the class policy should be repeatedly explained to the masses. Attention should be paid to the comprehensiveness of the class policy in propaganda work. The propaganda methods should be diversified, not only holding mass meetings, but also holding small-scale forums or conducting individual talks to solve specific ideological problems. Once the masses have grasped the class policy, they will consciously implement the Party's policy. For example, the fact that the backbone members selected by the masses in many cooperatives can meet the Party's requirements is a good illustration.
    Whether or not production can be increased is one of the most important indicators for checking the quality of a cooperative. Therefore, the new cooperatives must effectively organize collective production to achieve the goal of increasing production. When the production order of the new cooperatives had not yet been established, the Lushan County Committee first allowed them to organize temporary labor groups (or production teams) to formulate short-term production plans, study fair and reasonable work evaluation and point recording methods, and organize members to carry out collective labor. Except for some farm work (such as the autumn harvest) that still retained the exchange labor method of mutual aid groups, collective management was adopted as much as possible in major farm work, especially in various production activities in preparation for increasing production next year. At the same time, the township branch promptly understood the ideological situation of the new members and encouraged their enthusiasm for labor. For example, the members of the Xiaorcheng Township Cooperative in the Fifth District had four fears when they started production: fearing that others would do more and take away the grain from their own land; fearing paying wages; fearing not earning work points; and fearing that mutual benefit would not be emphasized in production. In response to these ideas, the Party branch introduced the old cooperative's work evaluation and point recording methods and the value of each working day to the members, and specifically calculated income accounts for various types of households. It also organized the new and old cooperatives to carry out production competitions, which eliminated the ideological concerns of the members. In addition, they also organized the old cooperatives to help the new cooperatives in production and business management. For example, the Kangzhuang Cooperative in Zhangzhuang Township in the Eighth District could not carry out collective management due to the lack of cattle. The Party branch mobilized nine old cooperatives in the township to send livestock to support them, which solved the production difficulties of the new cooperative and allowed them to plant wheat on time. The Xiaorcheng Township in the Fifth District organized old cooperative cadres to participate in the business management meetings of the new cooperatives, specifically explaining to the cooperative cadres the methods of compiling production teams, evaluating work and recording points, and implementing small contracting, so that the new cooperative cadres quickly learned how to switch to collective production, which played a great role in the consolidation of the cooperatives.

    保证新建的农业生产合作社的质量
    赵宗惠
    河南省鲁山县最近发展了八百八十二个农业生产合作社，连原有的一千一百三十七个社在内，现在全县共有两千零十九个社，入社农户占全县农户的百分之八十强。这许多新建的社，基本上都符合党中央“既要数量，又要质量”的要求。鲁山县委采取了各种有效的措施来保证新社的质量。
    在进行社的发展工作之前，全县的党员和非党干部都认真学习了党中央和毛泽东同志关于发展农业社必须注重质量的指示。在九月下半月召开的建社干部会议及县、区、乡三级扩大干部会议上，县委特别强调保证新社质量的重要性，提醒大家防止单纯追求数字。各乡支部在进行全乡合作化全面规划的时候，总结了过去建社时忽视质量的经验教训。通过反复的学习，党内党外对保证质量问题都有了一定的认识，这给建社工作创造了有利条件。但这决不是说，一切问题都解决了。当工作表现一些成绩的时候，有些人曾被眼前的胜利冲昏了头脑，认为“高潮来了”，开一个会议就解决全部问题了，于是不再去做细致的思想工作，把数量质量并重的原则忘记了。面对这种情况，县委就及时提醒他们，通过会议和集中训练的方式使这些干部的头脑变得清醒起来，克服他们骄傲自满情绪和盲目性。
    要保证合作社的质量，建社之前的准备工作具有决定性的意义。鲁山县委在建社之前做了这样一些准备工作：第一，审查社架子是否具备转社条件，群众是否经过思想动员，骨干和社员政治上是否可靠。检查后把社架子分成几种类型，分别进行具体工作。第二，认真地培养建社骨干。县委开办了训练班，训练了两千五百十八名骨干，并注意在实际工作中提高他们的工作能力。八区区委组织新社骨干参加老社召开的各种会议，向老社干部学习工作方法；七区实行了一个老社干部带一个新社骨干的辅导方法，并组织骨干学习先进的办社经验；有些乡召开了骨干分子会议，采取边教、边学、边建社的做法。这样就在短期内培养了一大批建社骨干。第三，向群众进行深入的思想动员。做好这个工作的关键是要使干部认识到思想动员的重要性。县委向全体党员和非党干部反复指出：不要一看到群众的合作化积极性就满足了，群众有入社的积极性，但并不等于说他们已经完全懂得合作化的方针、政策和具体办法，如果不向他们进行充分的思想动员工作，这种积极性是不巩固的。干部在认识思想动员工作的意义以后，就广泛地展开了宣传工作，使农民的思想顾虑大大减少，不少地方农民成批地报名入社。
    正确地贯彻执行农村合作化运动的阶级政策是保证新社质量的不可缺少的条件。鲁山全县八百八十二个新建社，贫农和下中农在社内占绝对优势的有七百三十个；贫农、下中农和上中农力量相等的有一百二十五个；上中农占优势的只有二十七个。全县新建社二千六百四十六个正副社长中，一千九百七十个是贫农，五百九十五个是新老中农中的下中农。县委在贯彻执行阶级政策的时候，抓住了三个关键：一、采取总结工作的办法树立干部的阶级观点。五区二郎庙乡党支部总结了贫农历年来在互助合作运动中的成绩，发现领导权在贫农手中的社都办得很好，如先锋社全社绝大多数社员是贫农，社会主义觉悟较高，这个社三年来年年扩大，不但社办得很好，并且各方面都能起模范作用。事实教育了干部在合作化运动中必须依靠贫农；二、对骨干和社员的政治情况进行审查，防止反革命分子、坏分子混入社内。社内骨干的产生首先由党支部提名，然后由群众酝酿选举，最后由区委批准。对所有入社的社员的政治历史情况也要进行适当的了解，必须把政治上不可靠或品质恶劣的人清洗出去或对他们实行群众性的监督。三、向群众反复交代阶级政策。在宣传工作中要注意阶级政策的全面性。宣传方式要多样化，不但要开群众大会，也要召开小型座谈会，或进行个别谈话，解决具体思想问题。群众一旦掌握了阶级政策，他们就会自觉地去执行党的政策，如许多社由群众挑选出来的骨干分子都能符合党的要求，就是很好的说明。
    能否增产是检查社的质量的一个最重要的标志，因此新建社必须有效地组织集体生产，达到增产的目的。当新建社生产秩序还没有建立起来的时候，鲁山县委就先让它们组织临时的劳动小组（或生产队）制定短期的生产计划，研究出公平合理的评工记分办法，组织社员进行集体劳动。除对某些农活（如秋收）仍保留互助组的换工办法外，在主要农活上，特别是为明年增产作准备的各种生产活动上，都尽量采取了集体经营的方式。同时乡支部及时了解新社员的思想情况，鼓舞他们的劳动热情。如五区小尔城乡合作社的社员在开始生产的时候有四怕：怕别人做得多，把自己地里的粮食分走；怕出工资；怕挣不到工分；怕生产中不讲互利。党支部针对这些思想向社员介绍了老社评工记分的办法和每个劳动日的价值，并帮助各种类型户具体地算了收入账，又组织新老社开展了生产竞赛，这样才把社员的思想顾虑打消了。此外，他们又组织老社在生产上和经营管理上帮助新社。如八区张庄乡康庄社因牛少不能开展集体经营，党支部便发动全乡九个老社派牲口前往支援，使新社解决了生产困难，按时种上了麦。五区小尔城乡组织老社干部到新社参加经营管理会议，具体地向社干部交代编制生产队、评工记分、实行小包工等办法，使新社干部很快地学会了转入集体生产的办法，这对于合作社的巩固起了很大的作用。
