　　Tenth Anniversary of the Founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia

　　Today is the tenth anniversary of the founding of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. The Chinese people warmly celebrate this glorious festival of the Yugoslav people.

　　Ten years ago today, the liberated Yugoslav people abolished the monarchy and officially announced the establishment of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. This day was achieved by the Yugoslav people at the cost of significant sacrifice. The various nationalities of Yugoslavia waged a long struggle for national independence and freedom. During the Second World War, their territory was occupied by fascist invaders, but the Yugoslav people did not yield. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, they bravely rose up to resist fascist oppression and enslavement. The Yugoslav People's Liberation Army, which grew in battle, finally defeated the fascist invaders with the assistance of the Soviet army, achieved national liberation, and established the first truly people-led country in Yugoslav history. After the establishment of the government of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia, it carried out profound social and democratic reforms, implementing public ownership of raw materials and power resources, large and medium-sized industries, transportation, banks and credit institutions, wholesale commerce, and a large part of retail commerce. At the same time, it abolished the system of private ownership of large amounts of land, carried out land reform, distributed land to landless and land-poor peasants, helped and led peasants to take the road of collectivization, and established socialist state-owned farms on the nationalized land.

　　In the postwar years, the Republic government used great efforts to develop industry, especially heavy industry. In recent years, more than 60 percent of investment has been used in industrial construction, and the funds invested in heavy industry have increased year by year. In this way, Yugoslavia not only restored and renovated many old enterprises but also established 250 new enterprises, including large-scale power plants, metallurgical factories, and machine-building plants. The renovation of old enterprises and the commissioning of new enterprises have enabled Yugoslavia's industrial production to grow rapidly. The industrial production index in 1954 more than doubled that of 1939. According to the planned schedule, the industrial production index for the whole year this year will exceed the pre-war level by 1.4 times. Industrial production has now become the main source of Yugoslavia's national income, accounting for 42.1 percent of the national income. With the growth of production and the increase in labor productivity, the material and cultural life of the Yugoslav people has also improved greatly compared with the pre-war period.

　　The Chinese people and the people of the world welcome with satisfaction the elimination of misunderstandings and the restoration of friendly relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. The Soviet-Yugoslav talks held not long ago laid the foundation for the further development of friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and led to the normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the people's democratic countries. The normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries has produced significant and positive effects. Trade relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and Eastern European people's democratic countries have gradually recovered and are developing. The results of the recent economic talks between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia have greatly strengthened the economic ties and cooperation between the two countries. At the same time, Yugoslavia has also signed or is preparing to sign agreements with some other people's democratic countries to expand economic ties in order to develop trade and cooperation between them. This kind of economic cooperation, based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, is undoubtedly very beneficial to the economic construction of Yugoslavia and the countries concerned.

　　It should be particularly pointed out that the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries and Yugoslavia is of great significance for strengthening the cause of socialism and world peace and for easing international tensions. The strengthening of friendship and cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries not only conforms to the interests of the people of Yugoslavia and the countries concerned but also has extremely important significance for the cause of world peace and the solidarity of the international working class.

　　The Chinese people have always had deep feelings for the Yugoslav people. We sincerely admire the Yugoslav people's revolutionary fighting tradition and the outstanding contributions they made in the common struggle against fascism. At the same time, we highly value the Yugoslav people's friendship with the Chinese people and the consistent support given by the Yugoslav people to the Chinese people's struggle to restore our country's legitimate rights to Taiwan and restore our country's legitimate position in the United Nations. China and Yugoslavia established diplomatic relations at the beginning of this year, which provides favorable conditions for the friendly cooperation between our two countries in developing political, economic, and cultural aspects. In recent months, the people of China and Yugoslavia have begun frequent exchanges and contacts, sending cultural, trade, and other delegations to visit each other. These exchanges and contacts will undoubtedly greatly enhance further friendship and cooperation between the people of China and Yugoslavia. It can be asserted that the friendly relations between China and Yugoslavia will be increasingly developed and strengthened. At the same time, we firmly believe that the heroic and hardworking Yugoslav people, together with other socialist and peace-loving people, will surely achieve greater success in their cause of building socialism and defending peace.

### 南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年

　　南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年
    今天是南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国成立十周年。中国人民热烈庆祝南斯拉夫人民这个光荣的节日。
    十年前的今天，获得了解放的南斯拉夫人民废除了君主政体，正式宣布成立南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国。这一天是南斯拉夫人民付出了重大的牺牲代价换来的。南斯拉夫各族人民为了争取民族独立和自由进行了长期的斗争。在第二次世界大战中，他们的国土曾被法西斯侵略者占领，但是南斯拉夫人民并没有屈服，他们在南斯拉夫共产党的领导下，英勇地起来反抗法西斯的压迫和奴役。在战斗中成长起来的南斯拉夫人民解放军在苏联军队的援助下，终于战胜了法西斯侵略者，取得了全国的解放，建立了在南斯拉夫历史上第一个真正由人民当家作主的国家。南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国政府成立之后，就进行了深刻的社会改革和民主改革，对于原料和动力资源、大型和中型工业、运输业、银行和信贷机关，批发商业和很大一部分零售商业实行了公有制。同时，它废除了私人拥有大量土地的占有制，进行了土地改革，把土地分给无地少地的农民，帮助和领导农民走合作化的道路，并在收归国有的土地上建立社会主义性质的国营农场。
    在战后的年代中，共和国政府用了很大的力量来发展工业特别是重工业。近年来百分之六十以上的投资都用在工业建设方面，而且投在重工业中的资金逐年增加。这样，南斯拉夫不仅恢复和改建了许多旧的企业，而且建立了二百五十个新企业，其中包括规模巨大的发电站、冶金工厂和机器制造厂。旧企业的改建和新企业的投入生产，使得南斯拉夫的工业生产迅速增长。工业生产的指数在一九五四年比一九三九年增加了一倍以上。按照预定计划，今年全年的工业生产指数将要超过战前水平的一点四倍。现在工业生产已成为南斯拉夫国民收入的主要来源，工业在国民收入中的比重占到了百分之四十二点一。而随着生产的增长和劳动生产率的提高，南斯拉夫人民的物质生活和文化生活比起战前也有了很大的改善。
    中国人民和全世界人民都怀着满意的心情欢迎南斯拉夫同苏联及各人民民主国家消除芥蒂，恢复友好关系。不久以前举行的苏南会谈，奠定了苏联和南斯拉夫两国的友谊和合作进一步发展的基础，并且导向南斯拉夫和各人民民主国家关系的正常化。南斯拉夫同苏联及各人民民主国家关系的正常化，已产生了重大的良好的效果。南斯拉夫同苏联和东欧人民民主国家之间的贸易关系已逐渐恢复和正在发展。苏联和南斯拉夫最近进行的经济会谈的结果，大大加强了两国之间的经济联系和合作。同时，南斯拉夫同其他一些人民民主国家也已经签订或准备签订扩大经济联系的协定，以发展它们之间的贸易和合作。这种以平等和互利的原则为基础的经济合作，对于南斯拉夫和各有关国家的经济建设，都无疑是十分有益的。
    特别应当指出，苏联和各人民民主国家同南斯拉夫关系的改善，对于加强社会主义和世界和平的事业以及缓和国际紧张局势，有着重大意义。南斯拉夫同苏联和各人民民主国家友谊和合作的加强，不仅符合于南斯拉夫和有关各国人民的利益，而且对于世界和平和国际工人阶级团结的事业有极其重大的意义。
    中国人民对于南斯拉夫人民一向怀有深厚的感情。我们衷心钦佩南斯拉夫人民的革命的战斗传统和在反法西斯的共同斗争中所作的卓越贡献，我们同时十分珍视南斯拉夫人民对中国人民的友谊，珍视南斯拉夫人民对于中国人民为恢复我国对台湾的合法权利和恢复我国在联合国中的合法地位而进行的斗争一贯给予的支持。中南两国今年年初已建立了外交关系，这给我们两国在发展相互间的政治、经济、文化各方面的友好合作提供了有利的条件。近几个月来，中南两国人民已开始了频繁的往来和接触，相互派遣了文化、贸易和其他方面的代表团进行访问。这些往来和接触无疑地将大大增进中南两国人民之间的进一步友好和合作。可以断言，中南两国的友好关系，将会日益获得发展和加强。同时，我们深信，英勇和勤劳的南斯拉夫人民，同其他社会主义的和爱好和平的人民在一起，在他们建设社会主义和保卫和平的事业中，定将获得更大的成就。
