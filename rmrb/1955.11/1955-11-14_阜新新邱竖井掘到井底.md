　  Fuxin Xinqiu Shaft Sunk to the Bottom
    The shaft sinking project of the Xinqiu Shaft in Fuxin, after ten months and four days of construction, has seen its main and auxiliary shafts sunk to the bottom on October 29th. This pair of shafts was designed by the Soviet Union and construction began on December 25, 1954, with direct assistance from Soviet experts. During the construction, mechanized construction methods were largely adopted. The workers overcame difficulties such as multiple geological changes and large water inflow, ensuring the progress of the project. As soon as the sinking work reached the bottom of the shaft, all employees switched to flat tunnel excavation preparation work. (Liu Hengfa)

　  阜新新邱竖井掘到井底
    阜新新邱竖井井筒掘进工程，经过十个月零四天的建设，主副两个井筒已在十月二十九日掘到井底。这对竖井是按苏联设计、在苏联专家直接帮助下从一九五四年十二月二十五日开始建设的。建设中，大部工程采用了机械化施工。工人们克服了地层变化多，涌水大等困难，保证了工程进度。掘进工作刚刚达到井底，全体职工就转入平巷开凿准备工作。（刘恒发）
