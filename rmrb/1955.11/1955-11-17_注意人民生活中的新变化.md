　　Pay Attention to New Changes in People's Lives
　　Xia Junhui
    The poor quality of rickshaw tires and tricycle tires produced in Shanghai is an old problem. Since 1953, consumers have pointed out that the outer linings of these tires easily break and burst, and the inner tubes also easily burst. The relevant departments in Shanghai have conducted multiple studies and improvements. In the past six months, the Shanghai Zhengtai Rubber Factory and Shuanglong Rubber Factory, which produce these tires, have adopted several methods to improve the quality of the tires. For example, Zhengtai Rubber Factory made the rickshaw inner tubes thinner, because they believed that the previous inner tubes were too thick and folded when inflated, which caused the tires to burst and break. Shuanglong Rubber Factory made the tricycle outer tires lighter and thinner, because they believed that the tire surface was too thick in the past, making it too strenuous for people to pedal, which was also a major shortcoming. In order to improve the quality of the tires, the factories have spent several thousand yuan on experiments in the past six months, but none of these improvements have achieved the desired results. There are still many opinions about the tires from various places. In recent months, many commercial departments in Zhengzhou, Xiangfan, Ningbo, Yantai, and other places have requested returns.
    What is the real reason for the poor quality of rubber products? The rubber factories in Shanghai generally feel helpless. To clarify this issue, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Goods Company and the rubber factories jointly organized a survey team to conduct investigations in Shandong, Zhejiang, Henan, and other provinces. The survey found that the reason why the tires kept bursting was due to the development of industrial and agricultural production and the improvement of people's lives in our country, the consumption nature of these commodities has undergone significant changes.
    Rickshaw tires were originally supplied for rickshaws, so their load-bearing capacity was originally specified at around 300 jin, which was of course entirely suitable for rickshaws carrying one or two people. However, after liberation, urban transportation developed, electric trams and cars increased, and the number of people riding rickshaws has decreased day by day. Rickshaws have gradually changed from transportation tools to transport tools, and the load-bearing capacity has greatly increased, but our factories are still producing tires according to the load-bearing capacity of rickshaws designed several years ago.
    In the countryside, farmers used to carry things mostly by shoulder or back, but now many farmers have switched to handcarts or wheelbarrows equipped with rubber tires. When the visiting team visited Zhuji and Caota towns in Zhejiang Province, they found that the wheelbarrows used by many farmers in these areas generally had a load-bearing capacity of 1,000 jin, but the tires produced in Shanghai only had a load-bearing capacity of about 300 jin. As a result, many tires broke and burst due to the large load.
    The visiting team also visited the porters of the Zhengzhou Longhai and Jinghan railway lines. In the past, porters carried things on their backs, but now they generally use trolleys. The trolleys are equipped with two wheels, and the wheels are equipped with rickshaw inner and outer tires, each carrying 800 to 1,000 jin. How can rickshaw tires cope with this?
    This survey gave everyone a good education, making everyone realize that to do a good job in production and sales, we must go deep into the masses, pay attention to new changes in people's lives at all times, and grasp these changes, and not fall behind life.
    Now, the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau and the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of the China National Goods Company have begun to organize special agencies to conduct research, striving to design new specifications of tires with higher load-bearing capacity and longer service life in the fourth quarter of this year to meet consumer needs.

　　注意人民生活中的新变化

    上海出产的人力车胎、三轮车胎质量不好，是一个老问题。从一九五三年以来，消费者就提出这些车胎外胎里子布容易折断、爆裂，内胎也容易爆裂，上海市各有关部门也曾作了多次研究和改进。最近半年中，生产这些车胎的上海正泰橡胶厂、双龙橡胶厂都先后采用了好几种办法，力求改进车胎的质量。如正泰橡胶厂把人力车内胎改细了，因为他们认为过去的内胎太粗，打进气还打摺，这是引起轮胎爆裂、折断的原因。双龙橡胶厂把三轮车外胎改轻、改薄，因为他们认为过去的外胎胎面过厚，踏车的人太吃力，也是一大缺点。为了改进车胎的质量，半年来，各厂已经花费了几千元试验费，但是，所有这些改进办法都没有收到预期的效果，各地对车胎的意见仍然很多，最近几个月来要求退货的就有郑州、襄樊、宁波、烟台等地的许多商业部门。
    到底什么是橡胶产品质量不好的真正原因呢？上海的橡胶厂普遍感到束手无策。为了把这问题弄清楚，中国百货公司上海采购供应站和各橡胶厂，曾在不久前联合组织了一个调查访问队，分别到山东、浙江、河南等省去调查。调查结果，发现车胎所以不断爆裂，原来是由于我国工农业生产的发展和人民生活的改善，这些商品的消费性质已经起了很大的变化。
    人力车胎本来是供给人力车用的，因此它的载重能力原规定是三百市斤左右，这用在一、二个人乘的人力车上当然是完全可以的。但是解放后，城市交通发展了，电车、汽车增多了，坐人力车的人已一天天减少。人力车逐渐由交通工具变成了运输工具，载重量大大增加了，而我们的工厂还是按照若干年以前设计的人力车的载重量在那里生产车胎。
    在农村，过去农民搬运东西多用肩挑或背驮，现在许多农民已改用装置了橡皮车胎的手拉车或手推车。访问队访问浙江省诸暨、草塔镇等地农村的时候，发现这些地区的许多农民用的手推车，一般载重量为一千市斤，但是上海出产的车胎的载重量只有三百市斤左右。结果许多轮胎就因装载量大而折断、爆裂了。
    访问队又访问了郑州陇海、京汉铁路线的搬运工人。过去搬运工人搬运东西都是人扛背驮，现在一般都用架子车推。架子车装有两个轮子，轮子上装着人力车内外胎，每次载重八百市斤到一千市斤。人力车胎怎能应付呢？
    这次调查给了大家一次很好的教育，使大家认识到要做好产销工作，必须深入群众，时刻注意人民生活中的新变化，并掌握这个变化，不要掉在生活的后边。
    现在，上海市轻工业局和中国百货公司上海采购供应站已着手组织专门机构进行研究，争取在今年第四季度设计出载重量较高、使用寿命较长的新规格的车胎，以满足消费者的需要。
